mr.
philip
m.
plant
mr.
justice
brennan
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellant
has
referred
repeatedly
to
the
opinion
of
the
california
state
supreme
court.
i
respectfully
submit
that
we
are
here
before
this
court,
on
the
facts
of
this
case
and
it
should
be
viewed
in
that
context.
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
issue
before
this
court
pertains
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
california
statute
which
imposes
a
use
tax
collection
requirement
on
a
foreign
retailer
having
a
place
of
business
within
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
this
is
not
unusual.
the
1965
special
subcommittee
on
state
taxation
of
interstate
commerce
found
that
from
7
to
23
of
the
36
sales
tax
states
then
reporting
to
its
survey,
had
similar
provisions.
also,
following
this
1965
report,
there
were
repeated
attempts
and
introductions
of
bills
in
the
congress
to
regulate
the
state
taxation
of
commerce
among
the
several
states
and
none
of
which
passed,
but
all
of
which
bills
provided
that
the
ownership
or
leasing
a
property
within
the
taxing
jurisdiction
would
support
the
imposition
of
a
use
tax
in
collection
requirement.
as
mr.
hanson
has
said,
there
are
two
constitutional
challenges
to
the
statue,
the
due
process
and
the
commerce
clause.
both
of
these
provisions
are
based
on
principles
of
fairness.
the
interstate
commerce
clause
is
satisfied
if
the
state
tax
in
question
does
not
constitute
an
undue
burden
upon
the
commerce
among
the
several
states.
the
due
process
clause
is
satisfied
if
the
state
has
given
something
for
which
it
can
ask
return.
that
is
if
the
benefits
given
and
the
opportunities
conferred
bear
a
fiscal
relation
to
the
exertion
of
taxing
powered
by
the
state.
we
submit
that
the
requirement
of
the
presence
of
a
business
office
within
the
taxing
jurisdiction
as
a
condition
precedent
to
the
requirement
of
a
foreign
retailer
collecting
a
use
tax
satisfies
both
of
these
tests.
firstly,
it
does
not
constitute
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
at
the
outset,
it
is
appropriate
to
note
that
the
purpose
of
the
use
tax
is
not
to
discriminate
against
the
foreign
retailer,
but
rather
to
place
the
foreign
retailer
under
a
tax
equal
in
amount
to
that
borne
by
the
local
retailer
who
is
subject
to
the
sales
tax.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
that
would
be
national
bellas
hess.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
in
that
situation,
the
relationship
is
such
that
under
analogy
to
scripto,
we
might
as
well
assert
a
tax.
we
might
say
that
the
solicitation
of
the
advertising
supports
a
magazine
which
in
turn
is
a
primary
vehicle
through
which
the
society
advertised
its
offerings
of
maps,
atlases,
globes
and
books.
moreover,
it
constituted
the
mailing
list
used
by
the
society
in
soliciting
these
mail-order
sales
to
california
residents
and
finally,
the
good
will
established
by
the
prestige
of
the
society’s
name
carried
over
to
enhance
its
sales
of
these
maps,
atlases,
globes
and
books.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
we
submit
it
does
not.
there
are
several
cases,
notable
among
is
sears,
roebuck
and
its
companion
case
of
nelson
versus
montgomery
ward,
which
make
reference
to
retailers
being
registered
to
do
business.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
this
court
has
decided
in
such
cases
as
general
trading
and
felt
entrant
that
there
is
a
sufficient
nexus
to
support
such
a
tax
in
the
absence
of
registration
to
do
business.
our
position
with
regard
to
that—
mr.
philip
m.
plant
there
were
solicitations
of
advertisements
to
be
placed
in
the
magazine.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
the
supreme
court
held
that
it
need
not
consider
them
because
it
found
taxation
independent
of
that
ground.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
we
consider
them
relevant
in
the
two
particulars,
you
honor.
in
the
first
instance,
we
consider
them
relevant
because
we
feel
they
are
not
de
minimis.
we
feel
that
to
the
extent,
they
overlap
the
first
taxable
quarter.
they
constitute
approximately
2.3%
of
the
taxes
during
that
particular
time
when
the
over-the-counter
sales
overlap
with
the
mail-order
sales
here
disputed.
that
is
2.3%
which
we
think
more
than
de
minimis.
furthermore,
we
noticed
that
in
the
second
quarter,
after
they
discontinued
over-the-counter
sales,
their
mail-order
sales
dropped
off
from
45,000
to
38,000.
so
we
say,
there
might
be
some
significance
to
that
and
we
take
the
position
that
there
should
be.
secondly,
the
fact
that
they
made
over-the-counter
sales
is
very
material
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
they
were
registered
to
do
business.
we
submit
as
one
of
our
arguments
that
they
did
in
fact
by
stipulation,
do
business
in
california
and
that
they
should
not
be
rewarded
for
their
failure
to
register
by
having
a
more
restrictive
liability
in
regard
to
use
tax
collections.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
that
would
be
correct,
your
honor.
but,
this
will
further
develop
our
argument.
we
do
not
feel
that
the
presence
of
a
local
retail
operation
is
essential
to
the
concept
of
nelson.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
well,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
to
the
extent
that
it
is
essential
that
they
have
a
retail
activity
in
state,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
the
due
process
clause
is
satisfied
if
the
state
has
given
something
for
which
it
can
ask
for
return,
if
the
benefits
given
and
the
opportunities
confer,
bear
a
fiscal
relation
to
the
taxing
power
exerted
by
the
jurisdiction.
now,
under
the
commerce
clause,
it
does
not
constitute
and
undue
burden.
as
i
earlier
noted,
the
purpose
of
the
use
tax
is
that
of
competitive
parody.
next,
i
think
we
should
consider
the
holding
of
this
court
in
national
bellas
hess.
in
that
court,
they
found
a
violation
of
due
process
and
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause
in
a
purely
mail
order
situation
that
is
to
say
where
the
foreign
retailers’
only
contacts
with
the
taxing
jurisdiction
were
through
the
use
of
the
us
mails
and
common
carriers.
now,
the
court
in
considering
the
commerce
clause,
brown,
made
reference
to
the
fact
that
if
a
interstate
mail
order
retailer
had
to
file
a
separate
return
at
a
different
rate
under
different
administrative
requirements
in
every
state,
political
subdivision,
local
county
and
school
district,
that
there
would
result
an
administrative
entanglement,
which
would
constitute
and
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
in
the
instant
situation,
we
are
only
seeking
to
impose
a
use
tax
collection
requirement
on
a
foreign
retailer
maintaining
a
place
of
business
within
our
state.
now,
the
1965
special
subcommittee
on
state
taxation
of
interstate
commerce
specifically
concluded
that
the
vast
majority
of
mail
order
retailers
have
business
offices
only
in
two
or
fewer
states.
for
this
reason,
there
would
not
result
the
administrative
entanglement
productive
of
the
undue
burden
condemned
in
national
bellas
hess.
moreover,
we
should
note
that
california
has
a
centralized
collection
procedure,
whereby
its
local
use
taxes
are
collected
by
the
state
so
there
is
only
one
collector.
turning
to
the
due
process
clause
as
noted
earlier
it
would
ask
no
more
than
a
fair
return.
we
feel
that
conditioning
the
imposition
of
the
use
tax
collection
liability
upon
the
maintenance
of
a
place
of
business
within
california
meets
that
test
because
by
maintaining
places
of
business,
the
foreign
retailer
necessarily,
substantially
draws
upon
the
benefits
conferred
and
opportunities
given
by
the
state.
in
this
regard,
it
is
interesting
to
compare
the
standard
pressed
steel
case.
in
the
standard
pressed
steel
case,
they
found
sufficient
nexus
to
support
the
collection
of
a
$33,000.00
tax
liability
on
the
basis
of
one
engineering
consultant
who
worked
out
of
his
home.
if
that
meets
a
due
process
test
with
regard
to
the
question
of
state
opportunities
and
benefits
conferred,
then
surely,
the
maintenance
of
two-employee
staffed
advertising
offices
in
california
would
do
likewise.
there
are
also
benefits
that
do
accrue
to
a
foreign
retailer
purely
by
virtue
of
mail-order
sales.
now,
while
it
is
true
that
national
bellas
hess
held
that
that
alone
is
insufficient,
it
nevertheless
is
note
worthy
that
the
court
in
general
trading
company
did
observe
that
the
foreign
retailer
doing
a
mail
order
business
benefits
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
state
protection
makes
possible,
the
california
purchaser’s
use
of
the
product,
which
is
a
sine-qua-non
of
the
sale
itself,
therefore,
there
is
that
benefit.
further,
there
is
a
benefit
that
the
california
facilities
are
available
to
the
foreign
retailer
if
as
here,
there
is
a
possible
credit
sale
problem
where
they
need
to
collect
delinquent
accounts.
so
even
in
a
mail
order
business,
there
are
benefits.
now,
it
would
be
insufficient
in
and
off
themselves
we
feel
that
it
is
one
leg
up
towards
supporting
taxation.
the
other
thing
that
we
would
like
to
observe
is
that
the
society
did
indeed
exploit
the
california
market
in
substantial
manner
with
their
mail-order
sales
and
this
is
a
factor
to
be
considered.
the
court
in
miller
brothers
versus
maryland
held
that
where
there
is
no
intentional
continuous
systematic
exploitation
of
the
market
of
the
jurisdiction
attempting
to
impose
a
tax,
there
is
insufficient
nexus.
however,
it
is
also
recognized
that
where
there
is
exploitation,
that
is
an
important
factor
and
we
feel
that
the
society,
as
a
matter
of
stipulation,
had
$452,470.00
worth
of
mail-order
sales
from
the
period
august
1,
1963
to
may
6,
1964.
there
is
pending,
as
reflected
in
the
pleadings,
a
determination
by
the
state
of
california
for
subsequent
periods.
it
covers
a
nine-period
and
a
board
has
been
assessed
for
mail-order
sales
exceeding
$3,000,500,000.00.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
as
regards
to
the
assessment
i
just
referred
to,
none.
as
regards
to
the
amount
over
the
counter
from
those
offices—
mr.
philip
m.
plant
well,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
i
am
saying
that
advertising
soliciting
activities
support
the
tax.
i
am
saying
that
we
do
not
need
those
over-the-counter
mail-order
sales.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
as
long
as
you
do
not
maintain
a
place
of
business
within
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
well,
that
is
correct,
you
honor.
we
do
not
feel
the
need
of
a
relational
requirement.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
think
that
miller
brothers
only
stands
for
the
proposition
that
where
there
is
no
intentional
exploitation
of
the
local
market,
that
there
can
not
be
nexus.
miller
brothers
and
national
bellas
hess
together
can
be
read
as
conveying
the
message
that
nexus,
to
support
taxation,
is
a
mix
of
physical
presence
in
the
jurisdiction
and
exploitation
of
the
local
market.
bellas
hess
said
you
got
to
have
some
physical
presence
and
miller
brothers
says
you
got
to
have
intentional
exploitation.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
that
is
true,
but
that
was
for
deliveries
that,
according
to
the
court,
were
resulting
from
the
residents
of
maryland
going
across
the
border
to
the
store
in
the
other
state,
and
they
ordered
material
and
then
they
delivered
it
with
their
truck.
but,
as
the
court
in
scripto
versus
carson
clarified,
miller
brothers
versus
maryland,
they
said
that
miller
brothers
did
not
go
to
maryland.
the
marylanders
went
to
miller
brothers,
and
that
was
emphasized.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
if
they
take
their
advertising
soliciting
offices
right
now,
they
are
not
liable
for
use
tax
collection
liability,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
that
is
correct.
that
was
in
response
to
hypothetical
that
they
pulled
them
out
and
they
put
somebody
else
in.
but,
if
they
pull
out
the
advertising
soliciting
offices
now,
they
have
nothing.
now,
i
would
like
to
touch
upon
the
reason
we
feel
that
qualification
to
do
business
should
not
influence
a
result
in
this.
first
of
all,
as
i
mentioned,
it
is
stipulated
that
the
society
did
do
business
and
they
should
not
be
heard
to
benefit
because
of
the
fact
that
they
did
not
register
as
they
should
have
done.
secondly,
as
a
matter
of
logic,
the
benefits
accruing
to
the
foreign
retailer
or
the
burdens
if
any
imposed
on
interstate
commerce
will
remain
the
same,
whether
or
not
they
went
to
the
formality
of
registering
to
do
business.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
there
are
references
like
in
sears,
roebuck
case,
to
the
fact
that
the
foreign
retailer
there
was
registered
to
do
business
and
i
feel
that
the
formal
act
of
qualifying
to
do
business
should
irrelevant.
i
like
to
make
one
further
comment
on
that
point,
and
that
is
as
a
matter
of
policy,
the
1965
special
subcommittee
noted
that
there
is
a
severe
compliance
problem
with
foreign
retailers
not
registering
to
do
business
in
states
at
that
time.
i
think
that
if
this
court
were
to
increase
a
foreign
retailer’s
susceptibility
to
taxation
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
voluntarily
had
registered
to
pay
state
taxes
that
would
only
encourage
evasion
of
the
state
requirement.
so
we
feel
that
it
is
inadvisable
on
that
ground.
now,
addressing
briefly
the
relation
point,
that
is
the
appellant’s
position
that
the
local
activity
must
be
related
to
the
transaction
taxed.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
if
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
local
activity
bear
a
relationship
to
the
transaction
taxed,
then
the
question
becomes
“what
possible
difference
could
it
make
what
the
local
activity
is?”
it
does
not
seem
in
terms
of—
mr.
philip
m.
plant
well,
that
is
right,
but
we
are
taxing
mail
order
sales.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
i
think
the
language
of
the
california
state
supreme
court
decision
has
to
be
a
read
in
context
of
the
statute
for
which
it
was
applying.
in
the
statute
which
it
was
applying,
would
not
i
do
not
believe
allowed
taxation
in
an
instance
such
as
that.
the
statute
in
question
said
that
the
tax
could
be
imposed
on
a
retailer
doing
business
within
the
state
and
went
to
define
doing
business
within
the
state
to
mean
a
retailer
who
established
a
sales
office
warehouse,
several
other
things
or
any
other
place
of
business
in
the
state.
so
therefore,
what
we
are
really
looking
at
here
is
not
how
you
could
hypothetically
expand,
add
info
item,
the
dicta
of
the
california
supreme
court
decision,
but
the
validity
of
the
california—
mr.
philip
m.
plant
well,
it
is
the
test
that
it
had
framed,
but
it
framed
it
as
whether
or
not
the
statute.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
my
position
is
only
that
i
respectfully
submit
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
statute
because
i
feel
that
if
the
state
did
not
have—
mr.
philip
m.
plant
well,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
that
is
right
your
honor
that
is
our
position
in
which
you
should
just
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
no,
you
did
not
your
honor.
we
just
feel
on
the
facts
of
this
particular
case…
mr.
philip
m.
plant
that
is
correctly
decided.
with
regard
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
local
activity
need
to
be
related
to
the
transaction
taxed.
our
position
is
in
essence
that
a
physical
presence
within
the
taxing
jurisdiction
should
be
enough
and
we
can
draw
an
analogy
to
the
area
of
in
personam
jurisdiction
over
foreign
corporations,
whether
or
not
they
can
be
subjected
to
suit
and
we
note
that
in
perkins
versus
bengay
mining
company
in
342
us,
it
was
held
that
a
foreign
corporation
having
administrative
activities
within
the
taxing
jurisdiction,
was
held
subject
to
suit
for
a
cause
of
action
arising
outside
the
state,
which
cause
of
action
bore
no
relationship
whatsoever,
to
the
in
state
activities.
several
commentators
have
recognized
the
similarity
of
the
due
process
requirements
in
the
area
of
taxation
on
one
hand,
and
the
area
of
in
personam
jurisdiction
on
the
other
hand.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
well,
under
out
statute,
i
do
not
think
we
would,
but
i
would
think—
mr.
philip
m.
plant
i
do
not
know
that
constitutionally
it
is
required
to
relate
to
the
transaction,
i
think
if
you
can
show
that
they
are
in
a
state
and
that
they
are
deriving
benefits.
well,
it
is
not
a
matter
of
taking
on
a
big
load
as
much
as
it
is
trying
to
equalize
the
position
of
our
local
retailers
vis-à-vis
foreign
retailers
and
the
ones
that
is
most
affected
by
this
decision
are
the
big
ones.
when
you
limit
the
requirement
to
just
having
use
tax
collection
liabilities
upon
a
foreign
retailer
with
a
business
office
in
the
state,
you
are
looking
only
at
the
rather
large
foreign
retailers,
who
are
the
biggest
competitive
threat
that
the
intent
of
the
use
tax
was
to
neutralize.
we
wish
to
argue
that
the
dissociation
test
which
was
set
forth
in
american
oil
company
versus
neill
should
not
be
applied
in
this
case
and
that
involved
an
excised
tax,
the
incidence
of
which
fell
on
the
foreign
retailer,
whereas
in
this
case
the
incidence
of
the
tax
is
on
the
local
user
and
the
foreign
retailer
is
required
to
collect
the
tax.
now,
this
court
has,
in
several
cases
recognized
this
distinction,
particularly
in
mcleod
versus
dilworth
in
the
norton
company
case.
it
is
a
logical
distinction
because
in
one
case,
the
foreign
retailer
bears
the
brunt
of
the
tax
and
he
is
neither
authorized
nor
required
as
a
matter
of
law
to
pass
that
burden
on
to
his
purchaser.
in
the
instance
of
a
use
tax
collection
situation,
however,
the
foreign
retailer
is
but
a
conduit
and
he
is
to
pass
the
tax
on
to
the
local
user.
mr.
philip
m.
plant
if
he
defaults
in
his
performance
as
such
he
is
ultimately
liable,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
had
only
two
matters
to
touch
upon
before
closing.
comments
were
made
regarding
the
periodical
exemption.
the
periodical
exemption
is
set
forth
at
page
3
of
the
appendix
2,
the
brief
of
appellee
and
it
merely
provides
that
the
magazines
or
all
the
materials
that
go
into
make
up
the
magazines
as
a
periodical
are
exempt
from
sales
and
use
tax
and
it
has
always
been
our
consistent
position
that
whereby
state
legislative
grace,
we
exempt
the
particular
activity
from
sales
and
use
tax,
does
not
mean
that
we
blindfold
ourselves
to
consider
that
as
a
factor
in
supporting
the
use
tax
collection
liability
that
is
appropriate
on
the
mail
order
sales.
we
noted
that
the
society
conceded
that
if
the
magazine
was
sold
from
its
own
newsstands
in
california,
that
the
disputed
tax
on
the
mail
order
sales
would
be
proper.
we
say
then
to
why
not
extend
it
to
this
situation
where
there
are
advertising
soliciting
offices,
both
activities
would
equally
draw
up
on
the
benefits
conferred
by
the
state.
there
would
an,
either,
event
be
no
greater
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
it
would
then
seem
that
the
character
of
the
local
contact,
if
it
need
not
be
related
to
the
transaction
taxed
is
fairly
irrelevant
so
long
as
it
is
substantially
draws
up
on
the
benefits
that
this
state
has
conferred.
in
summary,
we
feel
that
the
requirement
of
a
use
tax
collection
liability
on
foreign
retailers
maintaining
a
place
of
business
within
the
taxing
jurisdiction
meets
the
requirements
of
the
due
process
and
commerce
clause
test.
