justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
hanson,
you
have
not
yet
mentioned
or
conceded
or
covered
the
fact
in
this
case
that
there
were
in
fact
retail
sales-related
activities
in
the
state
during
a
part
of
this
taxable
period?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
the
california
supreme
court
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
even
consider
that
in
order
to
rule
against
you,
but
even
though
we
fully
agree
with
you
on
the
agreement
you
are
now
making,
that
unless
there
is
a
sales-related
activity
within
the
states,
then
bellas
hess
has
control
of
this.
nonetheless,
in
this
case,
there
was
a
sales-related
activity.
i
trust
you
are
going
to
get
to
that.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
very
same
items
that
are
sold
here
by
in
that
order.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
hanson,
i
want
to
be
sure
about
that.
you
do
concede
the
correctness
then
of
the
pressed
steel.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
case
was
vigorously
argued
here
and
i
just
wanted
to
show
you
that.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
suppose
throughout
this
period
the
magazine
had
been
sold
on
newsstands
or
over-the-counter
in
the
state,
although
there
was
no
instate
activity
with
respect
to
the
mail-order
sales?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
us
assume
that
national
geographic
sold
the
amount
of
their
own
establishments?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
know
it
would
be
different,
but
what
would
be
the
result?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
even
though
there
was
no
instate
activity
with
respect
to
the
specific
sales
not
be
taxed.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
your
answer
is
there
is
no
need
to
be
in
state
activity
with
respect
to
the
specific
sales
sought
to
be
taxed
as
long
as
there
is
some
other
retail
activity?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
accept
that
decision
i
gather.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
understand
that.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
you
have
reached
the
same
result,
i
suppose,
if
the
geographic
—
let
us
assume
in
nelson,
the
local
retail
sales
made
by
sears,
roebuck,
never
was
of
the
same
goods
that
were
never
on
the
mail
order.
i
suppose
you
get
the
same
result.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
you
call
this,
let
us
say,
a
local
sale
of
advertising,
retail
or
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
is
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
is
alright,
i
understand
what
you
mean
because
the
advertising
that
you…
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
it
is
a
solicitation
for
a
sale
at
retail?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
suppose
if
the
transactions
had
been
completed
within
california
that
would
have
been
subject
to
a
california
sales
tax.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
there
an
exemption
of
the
service?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
they
do
not
treat
it
like
a
laundering.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
you
rely
on
them
both.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
mean
an
instate
connection
with
the
customers
to
whom
the
sales
were
thought
to
be
taxed?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
about
nelson?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
not
with
the
customers
to
whom
the
mail
orders
were
made.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
not
with
the
customers
to
whom
the
mail-order
sales
were
made.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
was
an
instate
contact
with
retail
customers.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
they
taxed
those,
alright?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there
was
no
any
argument
about
those,
but
the
mail-order
sales.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
give
emphasis
to
the
selling
of
the
same
products?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
suppose
that
factor
were
absent,
what
then?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
that
was
really
my
same
question
if
your
client
was
selling
baseball
bats
or
shoes
inside
california,
then
you
could
seek
the
benefits
of
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
would
be
an
extension
of
scripto,
however,
which
would
directly
support
the
taxation
of
the
advertising?
