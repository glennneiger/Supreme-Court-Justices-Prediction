mr.

william
j.
brennan,

what
if
the
baseball
bats
that
were
being
sold
were
not
actually
sold
in
california,
but
there
was
active
solicitation
for
the
sales
in
california.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
and
what
would
be
the
result.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
could
collect
it
from
the
solicitor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
from
the
company.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
baseball
bat
transaction
is
certainly
to
be
concluded
in
california.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
admitted.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
other
case,
75-1868,
is
a
national
geographic
society
versus
california.
the
national
geographic
society
operates
a
mail
order
business
from
this
city,
washington
d.c.
and
in
the
tax
years
involved
in
this
case,
it
shipped
by
mail
from
washington
some
$83,500.00
of
maps,
atlases,
globes
and
books
to
california
residence,
who
had
ordered
the
goods
by
mail
from
that
state.
california
levied
a
use
tax
with
respect
to
the
california
purchases
and
also
imposed
an
obligation
upon
national
geographic
to
collect
and
pay
the
use
tax.
now,
states
necessarily
posed
a
burden
of
collecting
and
paying
the
tax
in
the
out
of
state
seller
when
they
can.
the
impracticability
of
its
collection
from
the
multitude
of
individual
purchasers
is
obvious.
however,
not
every
out
of
state
seller
may
constitutionally
be
made
liable
to
collect
and
pay
the
use
tax.
the
commerce
clause
in
the
fourteenth
amendment's
due
process
clause
tolerate
imposition
of
that
duty,
only
when
it
appears
that
the
facts
demonstrate
some
definite
length,
some
minimum
connection
between
the
state
and
the
person
upon
whom
it
seeks
to
impose
that
duty.
here,
california
found
the
necessary
connection
and
the
fact
that
the
national
geographic
society
maintains
two
offices
in
california,
one
in
san
francisco
and
one
in
los
angeles.
they
are
small
offices
of
not
more
than
four
employees
each.
however,
their
activities
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
mail
order
sales.
the
society
publishes
the
national
geographic
magazine
and
the
activities
of
the
two
offices
are
strictly
confined
to
soliciting
advertising
for
that
magazine.
the
california
supreme
court
held
nevertheless
that
the
activities
at
the
offices
were
irrelevant
that
they
are
maintenance
by
the
society,
sufficed
to
show
the
requisite
definite
length
or
minimum
connection
constitutionally
don't
impose
upon
the
society
its
duty
to
collect
and
pay
the
use
tax.
we
agree
and
we
affirm,
however
fatal
to
a
direct
tax,
for
example,
the
collector
who
seeks
tax.
the
disassociation
of
the
offices'
activities
from
the
mail
order
business,
we
hold
that
such
disassociation
does
not
bar
the
imposition
of
a
use
tax
collection
duty.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
result.
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
