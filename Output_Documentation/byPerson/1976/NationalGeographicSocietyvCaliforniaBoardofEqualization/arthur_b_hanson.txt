mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
mr.
justice
brennan,
distinguished
associate
justices,
may
it
please
at
the
court.
national
geographic
society
appears
before
the
court
today
to
ask
that
this
court
reverse
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
california,
handed
down
on
april
1,
1976.
that
decision
represents
the
farthest
reach
in
asserted
use
tax
collection
liability
by
any
state
supreme
court,
since
this
court
struck
down
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
in
national
bellas
hess
against
department
of
revenue
in
1967.
the
test
for
asserted
use
tax
collection
liability
set
forth
in
the
supreme
court
of
california’s
opinion
is
that
the
slightest
presence
within
such
taxing
state,
without
regard
to
the
nature
of
such
presence,
is
enough
for
a
liability
to
attach.
this
proffered
test
geodetically
created
in
california
as
“no
genesis”
in
the
jurisprudence
related
to
this
subject.
nor
has
any
state
legislature
or
the
federal
congress
ever
attempted
to
assert
legislatively
such
a
clear
cut
violation
of
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution,
as
set
forth
in
article
1,
section
8,
clause
3,
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
likewise,
the
california
decision
is
an
egregious
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
federal
constitution,
as
set
forth
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution.
this
court
has
specifically
addressed
the
subject
in
this
field
in
wisconsin
against
j.c.
penney
company,
referred
to
at
pages
3,
4
and
8
of
the
society’s
reply
brief.
in
saying,
“a
state
is
free
to
pursue
its
own
fiscal
policies
unembarrassed
by
the
constitution.
if
by
the
practical
operation
of
a
tax,
the
state
has
exerted
its
power
in
relation
to
opportunities
which
it
has
given,
to
protection
it
has
afforded,
the
benefits
which
it
has
conferred
by
the
fact
of
being
an
orderly
civilized
society.”
in
all
cases
decided
by
this
court
upholding
the
sales-related
taxing
authority
of
states,
there
has
been
meaningful
instate
exploitation
of
that
state’s
resident
customers.
such
instate
customer
exploitation
is
clearly
a
benefit
which
satisfies
the
due
process
requirements
of
the
constitution.
the
california
court
of
appeal,
first
district
also
stated
the
relationship
requirements
succinctly
in
1969
in
the
case
of
montgomery
ward
and
company
against
state
board
of
equalization,
referred
to
at
pages
16
and
22
of
the
society’s
jurisdictional
statement,
page
22
of
the
society’s
brief,
and
page
3
of
the
society’s
reply
brief,
where
the
california
appeals
court
said,
“the
protection
afforded
and
the
benefits
conferred
must
have
some
relationship
to
the
transaction
which
the
state
seeks
to
burden.”
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
refused
to
hear
this
case
in
1969
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
this
very
case
in
1970.
this
same
question
was
raised
in
the
instant
case
and
most
properly
answered
by
the
california
court
of
appeal,
first
district,
where
in
1975,
it
stated
in
pertinent
part
“what
did
the
state
of
california
give
in
relation
to
the
out
of
state
sales,
that
the
state
can
ask
a
return
by
way
of
requiring
the
society
to
collect
the
use
taxes.
the
answer
is
that
the
state
provided
no
protections
or
benefits
which
were
related
to
the
out
of
state
sales.
all
parts
of
the
transactions
were
conducted
through
the
federal
mail
with
the
state
playing
no
part,
and
providing
no
benefits
or
protections.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
no,
no
advertising
was
sold
in
california,
mr.
justice
white.
all
advertising
that
is
solicited
in
california…
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
some
may
have
been.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
no,
of
course
not.
they
solicited
advertising
and
the
record
is
clear
on
that.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
it
is
not
in
the
record
but
it
is
in
a
total
volume
in
a
given
year
in
the
period
of
this
case,
which
ran
about
$16
million.
california
supplied
about
$1
million.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
not
at
all.
there
were
over
800,000
members
of
the
society
in
california
and
at
$8.50
the
arithmetic
is
not
very
difficult
to
figure
out.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
about
$1
million.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
no,
it
is
much
more
than
eight
hundred
thousand
times
eight
gives
you
a
figure
of
about
48.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
yes,
64.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
it
is
about;
i
am
not
very
good
on
arithmetic
today,
mr.
justice
white,
but.
eight
times
eight
hundred
thousand
times
six
would
be.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
yes,
6,
400,
000.
it
is
about
6,
400,
000,
right.
it
is
more
than
six
to
one,
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
another
thing
while
we
are
on
that
subject.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
we
did
not
say
it
was
insignificant.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
the
state
also
furnished
something
else.
they
furnished
a
statute
which
specifically
exempted
the
magazine
and
its
related
offices
to
an
exempt
position
within
the
state
from
any
tax
burden.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
no,
it
now
asserts
that
it
does
not,
but
the
statute
is
very
clearly
set
forth
in
the
way.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
the
supreme
court
of
california
has
construed
it
that
way.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
in
california,
until
this
court
looks
at
it.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
no,
you
are
not
sir.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
i
would
say
not
if
the
california
law
had
stayed
by
the
supreme
court
of
california
is
purely
contrary
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
well,
but
that
is
why
we
are
here.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
that
was
its
interpretation
of
that
law.
we
respectfully
disagree
with
them
and
that
again
is
one
of
the
reason
we
are
here
and
the
complete
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeal
that
i
referred
to.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
i
do
not
think
that
that
statute
is
going
to
be
determinative
of
what
is
decided
in
this
case.
the
complete
opinion
of
that
court
is
set
forth
as
appendix
b
to
the
society’s
jurisdictional
statement
beginning
at
page
17a.
as
admitted
by
the
state
board
of
equalization
on
page
10
of
its
brief,
the
only
benefits
afforded
to
society
by
the
state
of
california,
relate
to
the
society’s
advertising
solicitation
activities.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
do
you
mean
the
advertising
sales?
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
on
that
subject,
mr.
justice
stevens,
the
record
states
very
clearly
that
they
either
paid
with
order
or
they
are
on
credit.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
that
subject
was
covered
very
thoroughly
in
national
bellas
hess.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
it
was
not
determinative
there
as
we
know.
clearly,
if
california
chose
to
impose
a
tax
on
services,
the
due
process
test
set
forth
in
wisconsin
against
j.c.
penney,
referred
to
earlier,
would
be
satisfied.
the
state
of
california
however,
has
chosen
not
to
impose
a
tax
on
such
activities
and
its
election
to
not
so
tax
those
activities
does
not
entitle
the
state
constitutionally,
that
tax
is
a
more
convenient
alternative,
other
totally
unrelated
out
of
state
activities
of
the
society
for
which
the
state
of
california
has
clearly
given
nothing
for
which
it
can
ask
return.
the
questions
in
positions
of
the
parties
in
this
case
have
been
thoroughly
briefed
by
both
parties.
national
geographic
society
will
not
reargue
those
papers.
rather,
having
stated
the
two
constitutional
questions
at
the
outset,
the
society
will
endeavor
to
outline
the
basic
fallacy
of
the
state
board’s
case
and
point
out
the
effect
that
an
affirmation
of
the
california
decision
would
have
throughout
this
country.
as
this
has
been
ably
pointed
out,
the
amicus
curiae
brief
from
the
direct
mail
marketing
association
inc.,
urging
reversal
of
the
california
court’s
decision,
beginning
on
page
3.
some
45
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
require
out
of
state
sellers
to
collect
use
taxes
on
sales
made
to
the
residents
of
the
state.
as
has
also
been
pointed
out,
there
has
been
no
uniformity
in
the
state’s
statutes
on
this
subject
and
the
federal
congress
has
not
yet
enacted
a
uniform
sales
and
use
tax
act,
although
extensive
hearings
have
been
held.
both
the
state
and
we
have
referred
to
those
hearings
in
parts
of
our
brief
and
in
part
of
our
reply
brief,
thus
the
only
protection
for
the
society
and
others
similarly
affected
is
to
rely
on
the
federal
constitution
and
this,
the
highest
court
of
our
land.
the
exact
language
of
the
test,
california
would
have
this
court
adopt
as
this
follows:
where
an
out
of
state
seller
conducts
substantial
mail
order
businesses
with
the
residents
of
a
state,
imposing
a
use
tax
on
such
purchasers
and
the
seller’s
connection
with
the
tax
instate
is
not
exclusively
by
means
of
the
instruments
of
the
interstate
commerce.
the
slightest
presence
within
such
tax
in
state,
independent
of
any
connection
through
interstate
commerce,
will
permit
the
state
constitutionally
to
impose
on
the
seller,
the
duty
of
collecting
the
use
tax
from
such
mail
order
purchasers
and
the
liability
for
payer
to
do
so.
to
us,
this
proposed
test
is
a
little
short
of
ludicrous.
does
this
mean
that
if
the
society
sends
a
writer
and
a
photographer
to
california,
that
the
state
could
impose
use
tax
collection
liability
based
on
their
presence
in
the
state?
suppose,
a
writer
is
a
resident
of
california
and
submits
a
story
to
the
society
which
is
accepted
for
publication,
does
that
make
the
society
liable?
the
answer
should
be
resoundingly
“no.”
yet,
the
state
might
well
argue
to
the
contrary
where
this
proposed
test
to
be
permitted
to
stand.
we
used
an
example
in
our
reply
brief
of
the
society
owning
a
parking
lot
in
california,
not
operating,
merely
owning
it.
under
the
state’s
view
of
this
case,
that
would
immediately
attach
us
to
use
tax
liability,
although
there
is
absolutely
no
connection
between
that
and
the
sales
that
are
discussed
in
this
case.
this
court
must
face
the
real
test
of
use
tax
collection
liability.
this
is
the
first
case
before
this
court,
where
a
state
court
has
asserted
that
a
non-sales
related
presence
in
a
state,
that
is
one
that
has
no
connection
with
or
relationship
to
any
sales
whatsoever,
will
justify
a
position
of
use
tax
collection
liability
on
interstate
sales.
neither
the
state
nor
anyone
else
can
point
with
a
single
case
where
such
liability
has
attached
absence
on
direct
retail,
sales-related
activity
in
the
state.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
during
a
period
of
about
nine
months,
which
the
california
court
of
appeal
regarded
as
the
de
minimis
and
the
california
supreme
court
said
that
it
was
not
necessarily
even
consider
that.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
i
am
coming
to
it
but
let
me
address
it
for
a
moment
now.
there
is
a
reason
as
to
why
the
state
board
and
we
agreed
to
set
up
two
periods
for
the
courts
to
consider.
we
set
up
one
period
where
there
were
sales
activities,
minor
as
they
were,
in
the
san
francisco
and
los
angeles
offices.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
that
is
correct
and
in
return,
we
set
up
the
second
period
beginning
with
the
quarter
that
ended
in
september,
where
those
activities
had
ceased.
they
actually
ceased
on
may
6
and
we
paid
the
tax
on
the
period
where
we
had
sales-related
activities
and
did
not
ask
for
a
refund.
we
asked
for
a
refund
of
the
tax
assessed
for
the
period
in
which
the
sales-related
activities
had
ceased.
there
is
only
a
period
from
the
first
of
august
1963,
to
may
6,
1964,
in
which
there
were
any
sales-related
activities
in
this.
there
were
never
any
before,
and
there
have
never
been
any
since,
but
i
will
cover
that
further
as
we
go
along.
in
every
case
where
a
liability
has
attached,
there
have
been
either
retail
sales
outlets
in
the
state
or
salesperson
soliciting
orders
in
the
state
or
as
in
the
case
of
standard
pressed
steel
company
against
washington
revenue
department,
referred
to
at
page
21
of
the
society’s
jurisdictional
statement,
page
28
of
the
society’s
brief,
and
page
17
of
the
society
reply
brief,
in
a
case
which
we
think
was
rightly
decided.
an
in
state
resident
employee,
someone
who
is
living
in
the
state
who
has
something
to
do
with
the
sales
involved.
in
this
case,
he
was
an
engineer.
he
consulted
with
the
end
user
of
his
company’s
products,
and
he
also
worked
with
his
company’s
engineers
at
least
three
days
every
six
weeks
on
the
very
subject
of
the
sales
which
involved
the
boeing
aircraft
company,
guiding
both
the
end
user
and
his
company’s
engineers
on
the
needed
technical
requirements.
he
also
acted
as
a
troubleshooter
if
something
went
wrong
with
their
materials.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
we
do,
indeed.
we
do
not
think
it
is
applicable
in
this
case.
the
society’s
advertising
solicitors
made
no
retail
sales,
i
might
say,
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
we
stated
that
in
our
reply
brief
in
the
concluding
part
of
it
where
we
have
discussed
in
the
state
of
new
york’s
amicus,
which
made
much
of
washington
pressed
steel
and
we
stated
there
that
we
felt
it
was
rightly
decided.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
i
know
it
was,
sir,
but
we
think
based
on
the
factual
statement
that
the
record
shows
that
it
was
rightly
decided.
the
society’s
advertising
solicitors
made
no
retail
sales
of
goods
in
california
or
anywhere
else.
the
society’s
advertising
offices
in
california
were
restricted
in
authority
and
function
solely
to
the
solicitation
of
national
advertising
copy
for
the
exempt
magazine,
except
for
the
brief
period
of
august
1,
1963
to
may
6,
1964.
as
noted
on
pages
7
and
8
of
the
society’s
jurisdictional
statement
and
page
26
of
the
society’s
brief,
the
california
court
of
appeal
found
a
few
sales
in
this
period
to
be
de
minimis
and
the
supreme
court
of
california
disregarded
these
sales
for
purposes
of
its
decision.
i
think
it
might
be
well
to
note
just
what
the
percentage
involved
in
the
period
at
that
time
was.
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
appellant,
if
you
look
at
page
11,
you
will
find
a
discussion
of
the
miller
brothers
sales
which
were
rather
interesting,
where
in
miller
brothers
against
maryland,
there
was
$12,000.00
worth
of
sales,
of
which
eight
were
delivered
in
maryland
by
miller
brothers’
truck.
well,
that
was
a
five
to
four
decision.
when
we
come
to
the
society’s
picture,
the
san
francisco
office
sold
a
sum
of
$679.20
worth
of
goods.
the
los
angeles
office
was
$2,161.85.
while
during
that
period
from
august
1,
1963
to
may
6,
1964,
the
society
sold
through
interstate
commerce
to
california,
$452,470.00
worth
of
goods.
that
is
on
to
the
bottom
of
page
13
of
the
reply
brief
and
that
figure
was
0.63%
of
the
volume
of
mail-order
sales,
the
amount
that
was
actually
sold
to
offices.
one
of
those
offices
was
at
the
10th
story
of
an
18-story
building
and
the
other
was,
at
that
time,
on
the
2nd
story
of
a
2-story
building
and
is
now
on
about
15th
or
20th
floor
of
a
28-story
building.
they
are
not
designed
for
retail
sales,
they
never
have
been.
the
society
took
no
mail
orders
in
california.
the
society
had
no
door-to-door
solicitors
in
california,
seeking
mail
orders
to
be
filed
outside
california.
the
society
had
no
local
advertising
by
either
written
or
electronic
media,
advertising
its
products
in
california.
the
society
made
use
of
no
local
flyers
or
handbills
for
the
solicitation
of
mail
orders
from
california
residents.
in
this
connection,
the
california
court
of
appeal
expressly
stated
the
solicitation
of
advertisements
to
appear
in
the
magazine
had
no
effect
upon
whether
california
residents
would
purchase
products
of
the
society,
which
they
so
advertised
in
the
magazine
or
in
mailed
circulars.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
i
think
again,
it
would
depend
on
how
they
got
to
the
newsstands
as
you,
perhaps
know.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
do
you
mean
that
they
would
have
newsstands
that
they
maintain
in
california?
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
i
think
it
would
be
a
completely
different
case.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
well,
i
think
that
in
all
probability
that
a
use
tax
would
apply.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
no,
but
we
would
have
had
to,
at
that
point
we
had
been
licensed
to
do
business
in
the
state.
we
would
be
operating
under
the
protection
of
state
on
a
substantial
business.
we
are
advertising
the
goods
in
the
magazine
and
at
that
point,
i
think
that…m
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
well,
let
us
take
a
look
at
nelson
against
sears,
roebuck.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
we
do
accept
it,
but
we
do
not
accept
is
the
application
by
the
supreme
court
of
california.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
in
nelson
also,
the
records
in
this
court
which
we
went
through
very
thoroughly,
point
out
that
sears,
roebuck
maintained
12
stores
in
the
state
and
that
their
volume
of
sales
which
appears,
i
think
on
page
12
of
our
brief,
show
that
sears,
roebuck,
again
in
our
reply
brief,
the
volume
of
sales
with
the
instate
stores
was
$5,040,000.00
and
the
sales
by
mail
order,
it
is
at
the
top
of
page
14,
$5,080,000.00
in
the
sales
in
the
stores
and
$5,900,000.00
in
the
mail-order
sales
and
they
were
selling
exactly
the
same
goods
in
both
and
in
addition
to
that,
the
record
showed
that
a
number
of
those
sales
were
actually
processed
in
the
retail
stores.
so
they
were
obviously
involved
in
that
and
in
addition,
in
nelson,
they
of
course
were
licensed
by
the
state
to
do
business
in
the
state.
the
state
had
jurisdiction
over
it.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
i
do
not
see
how
the
results
would
really
differ
because
of
the
involvement
of
the
organizational
company
in
the
state.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
no,
i
would
not.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
for
the
first
place
it
is
not
a
sale,
it
is
a
solicitation.
i
am
sorry
i
am
not
quibbling
with
you.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
the
advertising
was
all
sent
to
washington
and
cannot
go
into
magazine
until
it
is
approved
here,
there
is
no
contract
made
there.
a
man
goes
and
tries
to
interest
these
things.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
it
is
a
solicitation
for
the
sale
of
services
and
this
is
not
the
sale
of
retail
goods.
there
is
a
reason
on
the
case
that
is
not
pertinent
here
today,
but
i
think
that
the
virginia
pharmacy
case,
in
which
we
find
it
got
to
what
i
hope,
was
my
view
of
how
advertising
matter
should
be
treated
by
the
court.
it
was
treated
by
it
as
opposed
to
the
way
the
pittsburgh
pressed
cases.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
no,
again,
because
it
is
a
sale
of
services
and
california
has
nothing.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
that
section
63
or
62
of
the
california
code
specifically
exempts
it.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
no,
not
a
bit.
it
is
not
a
can
of
beads.
the
society
made
no
use
of
local
handbills
or
flyers
and
if
it
was
not
for
the
existence
of
the
two
advertising
offices
this
case
would
be
factually
on
all
force
with
national
bellas
hess.
it
would
appear
lie
between
miller
brothers
and
nation
bellas
hess,
but
much
closer
to
the
latter.
the
solicitations
made
for
the
society
for
the
sale
of
its
products
were
through
its
magazine
and
circulars
were
placed
in
the
interstate
mails.
in
effect,
the
magazine
was
the
society’s
catalog
and
the
difference
between
it
and
bellas
hess
is
that
bellas
hess
had
a
catalog
with
about
5,000
items
advertised
in
it
in
a
typical
mail
order
house.
in
the
two
exhibits
in
the
record
here,
the
society
had
a
three
quarter
page
ad
in
one
issue
and
a
quarter
page
ads
in
another
and
they
do
not
advertise
these
goods
in
each
one
of
the
magazines
that
put
out.
in
light
of
these
facts,
it
is
difficult
to
understand
how
the
state
of
california
reached
the
conclusion
it
did,
unless
it
believed
that
the
need
for
revenue
at
the
state
level
is
assumed
to
be
as
all
important,
as
eluded
to
by
the
brief
of
the
state
of
new
york
as
amicus
curiae
in
support
of
the
state
of
california.
the
main
point
in
that
brief
centers
on
the
need
of
states
for
revenue
and
in
effect,
as
to
the
california
supreme
court’s
test
be
accepted,
where
that
helps
the
state’s
revenue
needs.
certainly,
no
revenue
major
can
be
set
solely
on
need,
disregarding
constitutional
principles.
the
states
have
many
ways
to
obtain
revenues
without
violating
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
we
rely
on
together
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
every
case
involving
this
subject,
which
this
court
has
addressed,
has
combined
the
two
together.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
yes,
sir.
the
other
major
hurdle
that
the
state
must
overcome
to
place
use
tax
collection
liability
on
any
retailer
is
to
show
that
the
instate
activities
of
the
retailer
are
related
to
the
retail
sales
sought
to
be
taxed.
stated
in
another
way,
california
must
show
that
the
instate
activities
are
not
dissociated
from
the
operations
which
generate
the
alleged
use
tax
collection
liability.
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
california
decision
is
grounded
entirely
on
non-sales
related
activities.
no
clearer
case
for
dissociation
exists
than
here.
starting
with
connecticut
general
life
insurance
company
in
1928,
cited
by
the
amicus
in
support
on
pages
8
and
9
of
its
brief,
norton
company
in
1951
and
american
oil
company
in
1965,
this
court
has
consistently
refused
to
assess
tax
liability
where
the
instate
activities
were
held
to
be
dissociated
from
the
activities
generating
the
asserted
tax
liability.
the
basic
flaw
in
the
supreme
court
of
california’s
opinion
was
pointed
out
on
pages
27
and
28
of
the
society’s
brief.
the
california
court
tried
to
justify
its
whole
lien
by
misstating
the
language
in
national
bellas
hess.
that
case
clearly
stands
for
the
proposition
that
there
must
be
instate
contacts
with
the
customers
before
there
can
be
a
use
tax
collection
liability
for
mail-order
sales
and
that
a
totally
non-sales
related
contact
by
the
out-of-state
seller
with
the
state
will
not
suffice.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
no
problem
with
nelson
it
was
an
instate
contact.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
well,
there
was
indeed,
according
to
the
record.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
there
was
an
instate
contact,
as
justified
in
the
court’s
view
and
i
think
rightly
so.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
no,
local
advertising
was
carried
on
by
sears,
roebuck
of
the
exact
same
products
that
were
involved
in
the
mail-order
sales.
they
carried
on
both
radio
and
written
media
advertising
and
in
addition,
they
process
many
of
these
orders
in
the
local
retail
stores
in
iowa.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
they
taxed
them
both.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
the
mail-order
sales
contact
was
held
to
be
the
advertising
and
the
fact
that
the
same
articles
are
being
sold
in
the
retail
stores
or
being
sold
by
mail
order
and
that
the
presence
of
sears,
roebuck
in
iowa,
and
the
understanding
of
that
made
that
the
final
concluding
item.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
i
would
say
that
under
the
nelson
v.
sears
doctrine,
with
12
stores
in
the
state
and
a
national
organization
heavily
flooding
the
state
with
other
products,
realistically
we
know
it
does
not
work
that
way,
but
to
work
that
way
as
you
posed
it
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
think
that
there
would
be,
certainly
a
use
tax
collection
liability
could
be
assessed.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
if
we
were
in
california
with
an
active
retail
presence
in
california
and
a
totally
different
sale
coming
in
from
out
of
state,
i
think
we
would
be
stuck
with
it.
i
do
not
think
there
are
any
questions
on
that.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
yes.
i
have
jus
if
i
may…
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
well,
but
then
you
got
scripto,
you
have
got
scripto
layer.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
well,
i
think
that
a
use
tax
would
apply.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
no,
not
from
the
solicitor,
but
from
the
vendor.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
yes,
if
i
might...
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
no,
that
is
right.
if
i
might,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
had
just
two
more
paragraphs
and
we
have
had
some
extensive
questioning.
to
say
that
the
california
court
tried
to
justify
it
wholly
by
misstating
the
language
of
national
bellas
hess,
it
is
clear
that
under
the
prior
decision,
i
point
that
out
if
you
read
pages
27
and
28
of
our
brief,
they
were
beautifully
elided,
a
sentence
out
of
it
and
we
put
the
right
sentence
back
in,
the
way
mr.
justice
stewart
wrote
that
opinion.
it
is
clear
that
under
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
no
tax
in
nexus
has
been
found
to
exist
in
the
absence
of
meaningful
in
state
sales-related
activity
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
no
such
instate
sales-related
activity
exist,
which
will
permit
california
to
make
the
national
geographic
society
its
tax
collector.
accordingly,
it
is
most
respectfully
urged
that
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
be
reversed
and
the
decision
of
the
california
court
of
appeal
be
reinstated
with
whatever
reinforcement
this
honorable
court
deems
is
appropriate.
thank
you
very
much.
