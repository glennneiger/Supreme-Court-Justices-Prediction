except
the
magazines
that
came
through
the
mails
to
the
customers,
carried
the
advertising,
i
suppose,
some
of
which
was
sold
in
california.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
will
put
it
“solicited”
in
california.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
took
the
magazine’s
return
from
its
advertising
and
compare
it
with
its
magazine
sales
the
take
from
california
might
be
rather
substantial?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
you
say
the
volume
of
advertising
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
eight
to
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
64,
what?
eight
hundred
thousand
times
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not
insignificant,
the
advertising
returned
from
california.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
said
that
the
state
did
not
furnish
anything
if
you
had
two
offices
in
state
of
california
to
solicit
advertising?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
apparently,
it
does
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
way
it
has
been
construed,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
the
law
is
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
are
bound
by
it
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
are
bound
by
what
the
california
law
covers.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
a
different
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
that
california
furnished
a
law
which
exempted
this.
the
california
supreme
court
said
it
did
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
really
do
not
ask
us
to
differ
with
the
california
supreme
court
on
construing
its
own
statute,
do
you?
