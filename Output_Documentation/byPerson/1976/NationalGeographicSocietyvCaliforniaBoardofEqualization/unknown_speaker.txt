unknown
speaker
well,
they
had
two
offices
for
that.
unknown
speaker
they
just
did
not
keep
in
there
for
nothing.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
idea
what
the
total
volume
of
advertising
was
from
california?
unknown
speaker
6,
400,
000
unknown
speaker
mr.
hanson,
just
so
that
i
got
it
completely
clear.
you
are
relying
entirely
on
the
commerce
clause
or
do
you
also
rely
on
the
due
process
clause?
unknown
speaker
yes,
you
honor.
unknown
speaker
so
the
tax
factor
is
not
important,
then?
unknown
speaker
that
is
i
understood
what
you
said
earlier.
so
as
my
brother
blackmun
suggest
in
his
question
that
the
same
product
is
really
not
dispositive
at
all,
no.
unknown
speaker
if
these
two
offices
were
moved
to
arizona,
i
take
that
you
would
concede
that
the
california
use
tax
does
not
apply?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
society
from
its
office
in
arizona
sent
a
salesman
to
solicit
advertising
into
california?
unknown
speaker
what
if
any
significance
is
the
fact
that
you
do
not
require
them
a
license
to
do
business
in
general?
is
there
any?
unknown
speaker
mr.
deputy
attorney
general,
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
i
take
it
from
what
you
have
said
that
the
solicitation
of
retail
sales
and
the
accomplishment
of
those
sales
for
the
nine
months
period
that
had
been
mentioned
is
of
no
importance
to
your
case,
the
sales
of
articles?
unknown
speaker
i
am
drawing
the
distinction
between
solicitations
for
advertisements
on
the
one
hand
and
the
sale
of
goods
within
california
on
the
other?
the
california
supreme
court
said
that
the
sales
of
goods
for
the
nine
months
period
were
de
minimis,
as
i
understand
it?
unknown
speaker
right,
but
what
i
am
asking
you
is
whether
you
consider
those
sales
of
goods
are
relevant
to
your
position?
unknown
speaker
even
if
you
are
correct
on
both
those
points
and
even
if
further
the
fact
that
the
intrastate
retail
sales
were
made
of
these
same
items
during
the
period,
even
though
a
fairly
small
percentage
of
the
total,
should
bring
this
case
within
montgomery
ward
and
sears,
roebuck
yet
that
would
still
be
true
only
for
that
taxable
period
during
which
the
intrastate
retail
sales
were
made,
that
would
continue
forever,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
is,
it
would
give
your
state
power
to
tax;
impose
the
use
tax
only
for
a
specific
taxable
period.
unknown
speaker
you
concede
that
that
it
does
not
damn
this
people
forever?
unknown
speaker
now,
how
much
of
that
came
through
either
these
two
offices?
unknown
speaker
so
what
you
are
saying
is
that
but
for
the
offices,
you
would
not
have
any
case?
unknown
speaker
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
if
you
advertise
and
solicit
through
the
mail
is
that
taxed?
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
business
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
subscription?
unknown
speaker
mr.
plant,
you
have
referred
to
miller
brothers,
do
you
think
the
result
below
in
this
case
is
entirely
compatible
with
the
result
in
miller
brothers?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
sent
their
truck
over
into
maryland
and
serviced
their
product
over
there,
did
they
not?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
being
critical,
i
am
just
wondering
whether
the
decisions
up
here
have
been
entirely
consistent,
that
is
really,
what
i
am
saying,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general
if
national
geographic
takes
out
two
offices
out
right
now,
that
is
the
end?
unknown
speaker
a
while
ago,
they
sent
advertising
solicitors
into
the
state.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
a
matter
whether
or
not
a
company
needs
to
qualify
to
do
a
business
as
a
matter
of
local
statutory
law.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
constitutional
issue.
unknown
speaker
the
local
activity
must
be
retail
sales
activity
instead
of
the
submission,
as
i
understood
it.
unknown
speaker
the
retail
sales
activity
because
that
is
the
subject
to
this
tax?
unknown
speaker
take
the
hypothetical
case
that
the
local
activity
was
the
writing
of
an
article
in
california
by
a
california
author
for
national
geographic.
that
would
be
local,
clearly,
local
activity,
he
would
be
writing
the
article,
a
resident
of
california
writing
an
article
for
his
submission
and
publication
of
the
national
geographic
that
would
clearly
be
local
activity
and
that
under
the
phraseology
of
the
supreme
court
of
california’s
opinion
would
be
enough
to
constitutionally
permit
the
state
to
impose
use
tax
on
these
mail
order
sales.
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
the
dicta;
it
is
the
test
that
it
framed?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
have
any
presence
however,
no
matter
how
slight
or
however
slight,
whatever
it
said
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
solicit
the
sale
of
advertising
regularly
in
the
state?
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
not
need
the
sale,
was
it?
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
as
i
understood
your
statement
at
the
very
outset
of
your
argument,
you
are
not
necessarily
defending
all
the
language
of
the
supreme
court
of
california?
unknown
speaker
did
i
misunderstand
you?
unknown
speaker
yes,
that
is
what
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
do
you
not
like
to
find
some
nexus?
for
example,
if
national
geographic
set
up
a
rest
home
and
golf
club
for
its
employees
in
palm
springs,
you
would
not
put
stales
tax
on
them,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
it
has
to
have
some
nexus,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
he
is
ultimately
liable
though,
is
he
not
if
he…?
