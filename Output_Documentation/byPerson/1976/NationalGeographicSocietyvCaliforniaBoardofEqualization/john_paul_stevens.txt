mr.
hudson,
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
these
sales
are
made
on
credit
or
does
the
customer
send
a
check
in
when
he
places
the
order?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
am
talking
about
the
sales
and
taxes
imposed
on
globes
and
maps
and
things
like
that,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
cannot
be
credit
sales
and
presumably
will
be
possible
for
collection
activities
thereafter
to
take
place
within
the
state
of
california?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
