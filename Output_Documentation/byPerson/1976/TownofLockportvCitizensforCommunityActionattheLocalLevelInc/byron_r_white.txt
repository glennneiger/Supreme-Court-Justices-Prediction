justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
you
state
--
does
the
county
here
was
what
was
involved
is
a
new
county
charter?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
would
the
provisions
of
the
county
charter
be
equally
applicable
throughout
the
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
or,
with
respect
to
everybody.
justice
byron
r.
white
inside
towns
and
outside?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
they
subject
to
everything
that
there
is
--
that’s
in
the
charter.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
no
mootness
problem
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
with
respect
--
even
after
the
remand
and
after
the
changes
in
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
court
has
now
--
so,
you
must
say
the
court
was
in
error
in
having
its
judgment
apply
to
1974.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
long
as
you
accept
that,
it’s
not
moot?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
you
would
have
some
relief
if
we
reverse
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
you
could
provide
that
in
a
referendum
on
an
amendment
of
a
county
charter
that
the
people
in
the
town
get
two
votes
and
the
people
outside
the
town
get
one
vote?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
you
would
say
that
suppose
there
is
--
suppose
the
county
charter
provided
for
the
maximum
milady
(ph),
just
suppose
that
and
there
was
a
proposal
that
was
subject
to
referendum
that
the
milady
would
be
raised,
and
you
would
say
this
provision
in
new
york
the
way
it
is
would
be
proper,
namely
that
the
people
in
the
cities
would
have
--
people
in
the
towns
would
have
to
have
a
majority
in
order
to
approve
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
provision
applies
to
everybody
equally?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
yes,
but
just
a
while
ago,
you
answered
me
and
said
that
would
even
apply
to
milady
change,
that
isn’t
a
structure?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
think
that
everybody
would
have
to
have
an
equal
chance
at
defeating
that
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
some
charters
have
set
maximum
miladies,
i
hate
to
tell
him,
but
they
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
you’re
talking
about
is
the
structure
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
under
the
new
county
charters,
you’ve
said
earlier
in
your
argument
that
the
provisions
will
apply
equally
to
everyone?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
,
then
everyone
is
subject
to
them
to
the
same
extent?
