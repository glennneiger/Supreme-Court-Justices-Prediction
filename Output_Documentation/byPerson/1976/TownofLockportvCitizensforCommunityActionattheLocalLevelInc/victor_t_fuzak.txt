mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
a
three-judge
district
court
sitting
for
the
western
district
of
new
york.
that
court
ruled
that
provisions
of
the
new
york
state
constitution
and
of
the
new
york
state
municipal
home
rule
law
relating
to
the
procedures
to
be
followed
in
connection
with
the
effectuation
of
changes
in
the
form
or
structure
of
county
governments
were
unconstitutional
as
being
in
violation
of
the
equal
--
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
provisions
in
question
set
forth
the
procedures
which
are
to
be
followed
in
the
event
that
the
people
of
a
particular
county
wish
to
change
the
form
of
their
government.
the
traditional
form
of
county
government
in
new
york
state
is
a
legislative
form.
that
was
the
form
in
niagara
county
with
which
this
case
is
concerned.
the
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions
provide
as
follows:
if
the
citizens
wish
to
change
the
form
of
their
government
in
any
respect
or
to
transfer
functions
of
government
between
towns,
villages,
or
the
county,
they
can
only
do
so
if
the
county
legislature
adopts
a
local
law
for
presenting
those
changes
or
providing
for
those
changes,
then
that
local
law
must
be
put
to
referendum
of
the
citizens
of
the
county
as
a
whole,
and
then
in
order
to
have
the
local
law
take
effect
and
become
the
law
of
the
county,
that
local
law
must
obtain
the
majority
of
the
votes
cast
by
the
voters
residing
in
the
cities
of
the
county,
and
it
also
must
obtain
the
majority
of
the
votes
cast
by
the
voters
residing
in
the
towns
of
the
county,
both
taken
as
separate
units.
and
whether
or
not
the
particular
proposal
obtains
a
majority
of
all
of
the
votes
in
the
county
taken
as
a
single
unit
is
not
determinative
of
the
issue.
the
district
court
held
in
this
case
that
those
provisions
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
in
view
the
fact
that
they
denied
the
citizens
of
the
county,
the
rights
of
the
one
man
or
"one
person,
one
vote"
doctrine.
i
might
recite
very
briefly,
if
i
may,
the
facts
of
the
case
to
put
the
matter
in
perspective.
in
1972,
the
niagara
county
legislature
adopted
a
proposed
local
law,
which
would
effectuate
a
new
charter
form
of
government
for
the
niagara
county
residents.
that
new
charter
form
of
government
would
have
changed
the
county
form
of
government
from
a
legislative
form
to
a
combined
executive
and
legislative
form.
it
would
have
created
the
new
positions,
elective
positions
of
county
executives
and
other
subsidiary
county
officials.
it
adopted
that
local
law
and
it
put
the
local
law
to
referendum
in
november
of
1972.
at
that
referendum,
the
voters
of
the
towns
of
--
residing
in
the
towns
of
the
county
did
not
approve
the
proposed
changes
by
majority.
they
disapproved
of
those
changes.
the
voters
who
resided
in
the
cities
of
the
county
on
the
other
hand
by
a
majority
approved
the
proposed
changes.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
yes
sir.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
well,
they’re
not
small
cities,
they
have
different
functions
and
they
have
different
powers,
but
they
do
have
internal
government
structures.
the
town
will
have
a
supervisor,
the
town
will
have
a
town
board,
and
much
like
a
city
will
have
a
mayor
and
a
city
council
and
that
type
of
thing.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
yes,
i
think
it’s
--
in
point
of
fact,
it
is.
the
whole
state
is
divided
initially,
the
major
super
structure
is
the
county,
and
then
from
there,
you
go
to
the
city
and
the
town,
which
have
different
rights
and
powers,
and
so
on
and,
inclusive
in
the
towns
very
frequently
are
villages,
which
was
the
case
here
as
well.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
yes
sir,
that's
right.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
yes
sir,
that's
right.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
inside
towns,
inside
cities,
everyone
residing
within
that
county
is
to
be
covered
--
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
precisely
right,
yes
sir.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
12.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
there
are
three.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
each
taken
as
separate
units.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
correct,
and
it
was
a
majority
--
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
that’s
correct
sir.
what
you
suggest
is
conceivable,
i
don’t
exactly
know
how
the
voting
went,
but
that
is
correct.
what
happened
in
the
1972
referendum
was
that
if
you
took
all
the
votes
and
put
them
into
one
basket,
there
was
a
majority
in
favor
of
the
adoption
of
this
new
county
charter.
the
proportion
was
52%
to
48%
if
you
did
it
on
that
basis,
but
they
did
not
get
the
complimentary
majority
votes
that
are
required
by
the
constitution
and
by
the
municipal
home
rule
law.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
the
county
--
that’s
correct
sir,
and
then
included
on
the
towns,
there
are
will
be
villages
and
there
are
villages.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
yes
sir,
that
is
correct
sir.
so
as
the
consequence
of
that
failure
to
obtain
approval,
the
county
of
niagara
commenced
a
suit
in
the
district
court
seeking
a
declaration
by
the
district
court
that
those
provisions
of
the
state
constitution
and
the
municipal
home
rule
law
were
indeed
unconstitutional
on
these
grounds
that
they
denied
the
"one
person,
one
vote"
rule
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
county
of
niagara
purported
to
bring
that
suit
on
behalf
of
all
of
its
cities,
all
of
its
citizens
within
the
county.
the
defendant
in
that
suit
was
the
state
of
new
york.
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
no
substantial
federal
question,
refused
to
empanel
a
three-judge
court
and
dismiss
the
complaint.
that
judgment
became
final.
thereafter,
these
individual
defendants
in
this
action,
which
the
citizens
for
a
community
action
at
the
local
level,
the
acronym
for
which
is
cca,
begun
this
action
seeking
precisely
the
same
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
and
precisely
the
same
relief.
and
that
case
proceeded
now
naming
the
county
of
niagara
as
a
defendant
or
those
officials
of
the
county
who
had
official
acts
to
do
in
connection
with
the
certification
of
this
proposed
charter
and
also
the
officials
of
the
state
of
new
york
who
also
had
to
do
things
in
order
to
make
the
proposed
charter
of
the
local
law
of
the
county.
there
were
no
hearings
in
that
proceeding,
no
proof
was
educed,
instead
cross
motions
were
made
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
now,
there
three-judge
court
was
empaneled
in
this
instance,
yes
sir
and
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
were
made.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
yes
sir,
the
county
of
niagara
and
the
state
of
new
york
both
asserted
as
affirmative
defenses
in
their
answers,
the
defense
of
res
judicata
based
on
that
ground.
now,
there
was
no
particular
reference
in
anything
that
i
am
aware
of
in
connection
with
the
empaneling
of
the
three-judge
court
to
that
previous
determination.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
yes
sir.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
right
sir.
so,
the
three-judge
court
was
empaneled
and
these
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
were
made,
no
proof
was
adduced
and
no
testimony
was
taken.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
some
affidavits,
your
honor.
the
moving
papers
on
both
motions,
i
think
would
have
to
be
characterized
as
extra
ordinarily
spare
under
the
circumstances.
there
was
no
incisive
review
of
the
reasons
for
the
passage
of
the
constitutional
provisions
or
anything
of
that
nature
in
those
papers.
while
the
court
was
considering
those
motions
for
summary
judgment,
the
county
legislature
went
ahead
and
adopted
a
new
charter,
or
attempted
to
adopt
a
new
charter
in
1974
and
before
decision
on
this
case
summary
judgment
motions.
in
november
of
1974,
the
county
legislature
put
a
new
charter
and
a
different
charter
up
to
referendum
to
the
voters
of
the
county,
which,
by
its
own
terms,
would
supersede
any
previous
charter
or
any
previous
form
of
government
for
the
county
and
that
was
put
referendum
in
the
same
fashion.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
it
differed
in
certain
respects
your
honor,
but
not
materially.
there
were
some
changes
in
it,
i
think
made
in
order
to
accommodate
some
objections
by
some
people
in
the
town,
that
type
of
thing.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
that
is
correct.
and
essentially
the
same
result.
essentially
that
same
result
and
almost
by
the
same
percentages
or
proportions.
again,
there
was
about
a
52%
total
in
favor
if
you
took
all
of
the
citizens
and
put
them
in
one
basket,
and
48%
opposed
but
the
citizens
of
the
towns
again
reject
the
proposed
change
in
their
form
of
government,
the
form
of
county
government.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
no,
i
don’t
think
they
--
i
do
--
i
don’t
think
we
can
say
that
they
are
your
honor.
there
are
some
different
positions
involved
in
the
two
charters,
but
i
think
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
we
ought
to
regard
them
here
as
being
equivalent
in
their
scope
and
in
their
application
and
their
functions.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
that’s
right
sir;
that's
right
sir.
after
the
november
1972
--
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
the
same
result,
exactly
right,
so
the
voters
of
the
town
did
not
give
it
majority
of
approval,
the
voters
of
the
cities
did.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
there
was
an
overall
majority.
and
again
in
that
situation,
the
question
came
as
to
whether
that
charter
could
be
implemented.
and
an
application
was
made,
the
decision
of
the
court
on
the
first
charter,
the
1972
charter
came
down
shortly
after
the
november
1974
referendum
with
respect
to
the
1974
charter.
the
niagara
county
people
made
an
application
to
the
court
to
have
its
judgment
apply
not
to
the
1972
charter
which
was
subject
matter
of
the
previous
action
or
the
existing
action,
but
to
have
it
apply
instead
to
the
1974
charter.
the
court
refused
to
do
that
apparently
on
the
grounds
that
it
not
have
jurisdiction
over
the
1974
charter
which
was
not
subject
to
the
lawsuit.
so,
a
judgment
was
entered
in
january
of
1975,
declaring
a
1972
charter
to
be
the
law
of
the
land
on
the
grounds
that
the
new
york
state
constitution
was
unconstitutional
and
municipal
home
rule
law
was
unconstitutional,
and
that
since
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
were
no
statutory
provisions
to
support
this
kind
of
an
approach,
that
since
there
had
been
an
overall
majority,
that
therefore,
that
these
changes
that
were
proposed
could
take
effect.
and
so,
the
january
1975
judgment
said,
the
1972
charter
is
the
law
of
the
land.
the
attorney
general
had
indicated
that
he
was
going
to
appeal
from
that
judgment.
shortly
before
the
time
to
appeal
expired,
he
made
an
announcement
that
he
was
not
going
to
carry
forward
the
appeal,
and
so
the
town
of
lockport,
supported
by
the
other
towns
of
the
county,
made
an
application
for
intervention
which
was
granted
for
the
purpose
of
prosecuting
this
appeal,
and
that’s
why
we’re
here
today.
after
that,
after
the
appeal
was
filed,
the
state
and
county
officials
purported
to
put
into
effect
the
1974
charter
and
not
the
1972
charter
as
was
provided
in
the
original
judgment
in
order
of
the
court.
we
raised
questions
of
mootness
on
the
ground
that
the
subject
matter
of
the
original
action
had
been
destroyed
by
the
subsequent
conduct
of
the
party’s
litigant.
that
matter
was
up
before
the
court
on
our
original
jurisdictional
statement.
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
district
court,
the
original
judgment
was
vacated,
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings
in
light
of
the
1974
charter
referendum.
and
another
proceeding
was
had,
again
no
proof,
but
counsels
were
summoned
to
the
district
court.
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
no
mootness.
the
district
court
denied
an
application
by
the
call,
plaintiffs
here.
they
had
made
an
application
to
make
sure
that
the
case
did
in
fact
have
jurisdiction
over
the
1974
charter
to
amend
their
complaint
so
as
to
raise
the
questions
of
constitutionality
as
to
the
1974
charter
which
would’ve
fine.
we
would’ve
had
a
trial
and
we
could’ve
gone
through
the
whole
thing,
but
that
was
denied
as
well
and
the
court
found
no
mootness.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
that’s
right
sir.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
the
court
found
in
effect
that
it
was
empowered
to
make
its
previous
judgment
which
related
to
the
1972
charter
applied
to
the
1974
charter.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
it
did
do
so,
sir.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
it
entered
a
new
judgment
in
october
--
in
december
of
1975.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
well,
we
claim
there
is
a
mootness
problem
and
we
raise
that
on
this
appeal,
i
would
--
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
yes
sir,
because
we
--
our
position
on
that
is
that
prior
to
that
happening
the
actions
of
these
parties,
litigants
in
fact
destroyed
the
subject
matter
of
the
initial
lawsuit
which
was
a
1972
charter.
the
1974
charter
was
never
considered
in
the
lawsuit
at
all.
the
record
had
closed
and
the
matter
had
gone
to
appeal.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
yes
sir.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
no.
yes
sir.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
exactly
right
sir.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
that’s
right.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
yes
sir.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
yes
sir.
that
put
us
in
a
very
peculiar
position
because,
we
then
had
to
make
--
take
some
action
to
protect
our
rights
with
respect
to
the
1974
charter
and
that’s
why
we
were
required
to
start
an
action
in
state
court
under
article
78
of
our
civil
practice
law.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
yes
sir,
we
certainly
would.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
yes
sir.
that’s
one
--
that’s
what
i
am
saying.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
correct
sir.
what
happened
and
point
of
fact
was
that
when
the
matter
was
remanded
to
the
court,
the
court
on
its
own
motion
brought
in
the
1974
charter
and
made
it
an
exhibit
in
the
proceeding
and
so
on,
and
then
proceeded
from
that
standpoint
to
include
it
in
the
case
and
act
on
the
1974
charter,
amend
the
original
judgment
to
make
it
apply
to
the
1974
charter.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
correct
sir,
exactly
on
the
same
reason.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
essentially
--
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
quite
right,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
issue
here
as
we
see
it
is
whether
or
not
the
equal
protection
clause
among
these
issues,
there
are
mootness
and
there
are
other
issues
concerning
the
relief
that
was
granted
by
the
court,
but
i
would
like
to
address
myself
principally
to
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
or
not
the
equal
protection
clause
can
require
or
does
require
a
state
to
afford
its
citizens
the
right
to
determine
by
an
election
process
compatible
with
the
"one
person,
one
vote"
concept
or
doctrine,
the
form
or
structure
of
subordinate
government
instrumentalities
within
the
state.
and
the
appellant's
position
is
that
the
state
is
not
required
to
do
that
by
any
provision
of
the
constitution,
and
that
the
intervention
of
the
federal
judiciary
in
this
instance
would
be
improper
and
was
improper.
and
we
say
that
for
these
reasons
because
what
is
at
stake
here
is
very
clearly
and
purely
state
action
within
the
proper
sphere
of
state
action;
that
is
the
establishment,
the
modification,
the
repeal,
the
amendment,
the
abolishment
of
the
state's
own
internal
government
structures.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
i
think
that
there
are
--
in
all,
as
in
all
of
these
cases,
there
are
points
that
you
reach
where
the
situation
is
so
apparently
irrational
that
it
calls
for
and
would
require
and
would
merit
some
judicial
intervention.
i
do
not
think,
however,
that
the
automatic
application
of
the
one
person,
one
vote
doctrine
is
proper
in
any
sense.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
yes
sir.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
yes
sir,
i
would
for
this
reason
because
unlike
the
other
cases
where
this
court
has
applied
the
one
vote
--
“one
person,
one
vote”
doctrine,
this
case
deals
strictly
and
solely
and
purely
with
the
question
of
the
establishment
or
change
of
the
structure
or
form
of
internal
state
government.
the
other
cases
as
you
all
recall
of
course,
dealt
with
questions
of
representation
whether
or
not
someone
was
being
deprived
of
his
equal
vote
in
terms
of
representation.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
no.
well,
i
am
sorry
your
honor,
that
is
a
different
thing.
you’re
talking
about
a
taxation
matter.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
i
am
sorry,
i
misunderstood
you,
i
didn’t
hear
you
properly.
now,
that’s
a
different
thing,
that
would
not
apply
in
that
situation
because
the
--
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
no,
that
would
not
be
an
appropriate
part
of
the
charter.
that
would
not
be
an
appropriate
thing
for
the
local
law
to
include
as
part
of
the
structure
of
the
government.
that
would
be
an
action
that
would
have
to
be
taken
by
the
appropriate
representatives
within
the
government
after
it
was
formed.
i
don’t
--
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
well,
those
--
that
is
not
in
this
case,
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
and
the
only
the
--
what
is
the
problem
here
--
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
exactly
right.
and
that’s
all
that
was
done
in
this
case,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
that's
all
that
constitution
or
the
municipal
home
rule
allows
the
counties
to
do
is
to
change
their
structures
in
accordance
with
this
complimentary
vote,
majority
vote
rule.
so,
i
don't
think
we
can
get
involved
in
the
kind
of
problem
that
you
raise
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
yes
sir,
that’s
right.
it
thus
--
this
case
in
no
way
involves
any
claim
by
anyone
or
cannot
that
anyone
is
being
deprived
of
an
equal
vote
in
terms
of
the
selections
of
governmental
representatives,
because
whether
there
is
a
county
charter
or
whether
there
is
not
a
county
charter,
there
is
an
appropriately
constitutional
republican
form
of
government
for
the
county,
and
there
is
no
claim
here
of
any
discrimination
in
that
sense.
and,
of
course,
most
of
the
cases
that
the
court
has
applied,
the
“one
person,
one
vote”
rule
too
involve
exactly
that
point
as
a
matter
of
representation,
the
matter
of
portion,
districting
and
that
type
of
thing.
this
case
does
not
involve
that.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
yes
sir,
i
very
definitely
do
because
i
think
the
court
there
found
that
it
was
within
the
political
process,
political
judgment,
in
effect,
of
the
state
to
make
a
determination
that
instead
of
having
a
simple
majority
to
approve
additional
municipal
bond
of
indebtedness,
there
should
be
a
requirement
of
a
60%
majority,
and
the
court
said
that
was
perfectly
alright,
because
in
certain
circumstances
and
situations,
the
“one
person,
one
vote”
rule
does
not
apply.
and,
i
think
that’s
very
clear
from
the
development
of
the
cases
because
the
court
has
refused
to
have
an
automatic
application
of
that
rule,
and
that’s
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case,
i
am
afraid,
because
i
am
afraid
the
district
court
in
rendering
its
judgment
made
an
assumption
that
there
was
an
automatic
application
of
the
“one
person,
one
vote”
doctrine
and
i
take
issue
with
that
because
i
don’t
think
that
is
an
appropriate
assumption.
i
don’t
think
it’s
appropriate
constitutionally,
and
i
don’t
think
it’s
appropriate
on
the
basis
of
the
cases
that
this
court
has
decided,
in
which
the
court
has
refused
to
apply
it
like
wells
versus
edwards
when
you’re
talking
about
the
election
of
the
judiciary
and
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
it
was
expanded
to
some
extent
to
include
elections
involving
the
incurring
of
public
debt
largely.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
phoenix
city
or
phoenix
versus
kolodziejski,
city
of
cipriano,
cipriano
versus
city
of
houma,
and
that
line
of
cases.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
like
kramer
against
the
union
preschool
district
where
there
was
an
election
of
a
representatives
--
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
state
of
new
york,
but
where
there
was
an
election
of
a
representative
board,
and
again
i
think
the
overtones
there
were
that
the
board
that
was
being
elected
was
fulfilling
the
functions
of
representatives
of
the
people
and
that,
i
think
that
clearly
fell
was
in
the
avery
line
of
cases,
reynolds
versus
sims,
baker,
carr
and
so
on.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
yes
sir.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
county.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
hadley
against
the
junior
college
was
another
case
involving,
i
believe
--
it
escapes
from
me
at
the
moment,
i’m
sorry
to
say
--
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
junior
college,
yes.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
the
hadley
case?
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
well,
it
did
to
an
extent,
your
honor,
and
so
do
in
fact,
the
cases
where
the
one
vote
--
“one
person,
one
vote”
principle
has
been
applied
when
the
subject
matter
of
the
elective
process
is
the
incurring
of
public
debt.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
quite
right.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
yes
sir,
that's
correct,
and
the
court
as
found
--
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
that
is
right.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
whether
the
state
has
that
sovereign
authority
to
do
that
in
terms
of
setting
up
its
own
form
of
government.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
exactly
right.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
i
don’t
think
that’s
exactly
the
case.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
no.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
there
is
no
certain
--
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
answer
to
your
question,
there
is
no
transfer
of
functions
as
between
any
of
the
subsidiary
forms
of
government
involved
in
this
particular
charter.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
that
fact
is
not
--
does
not
--
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
behind
what
sir?
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
oh!
i
think
there
is
a
rationale
behind
it.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
your
honor,
the
rationale
is
that
i
think
that
people
have,
in
different
areas
of
a
particular
county,
have
different
interests
and
have
different
requirements
in
terms
of
their
county
government.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
they
apply
equally
to
--
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
that's
right,
except
insofar
as
cities
and
towns
do
have
by
state
law,
general
state
law,
somewhat
different
authorities
and
powers.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
as
in
point
of
fact,
what
we
have
here
in
niagara
county
what
the
situation
is
that
there
happened
to
be
some
more
residents
in
the
three
cities
than
there
are
in
the
towns
of
the
county.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
yes
sir,
they
have
jp’s,
they
have
a
town
board,
they
have
a
supervisor.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
they
have
constables,
they
have
general
governmental
functions.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
there
is
a
county
sheriff,
that’s
correct.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
exactly
right.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
yes.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
yes,
i
think
that’s
correct
sir
as
a
practical
matter.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
yes
sir.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
no,
they
are
not.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
no,
i
don’t
believe
that’s
true.
mr.
victor
t.
fuzak
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
