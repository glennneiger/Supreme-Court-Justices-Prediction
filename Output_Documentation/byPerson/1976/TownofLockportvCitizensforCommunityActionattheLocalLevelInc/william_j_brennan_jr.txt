how
many
towns
are
there,
mr.
fuzak,
in
this
county?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
many
cities?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather,
it
is
the
aggregate,
in
other
words,
it
must
be
a
majority
of
the
aggregate
city
vote
and
the
majority
of
the
aggregate
county
vote?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there
was
a
majority
of
the
aggregate
city,
but
not
of
the
aggregate
county?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
there
maybe
of
the
12
towns,
maybe
nine
of
them,
majority
there
may
have
voted
in
favor
if
the
total
was
not
a
majority
in
favor
then
it
was
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
affidavits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
form
of
that
government,
did
that
differ
from
the
1972?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
basically,
it
would’ve
been
an
executive
legislative
part.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
need
to
amend
was
denied?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
entered
a
new
judgment,
did
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see,
you’re
saying
there’s
simply
no
predicate
for
the
order
relating
to
the
1974
charter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
nothing
and
therefore
it’s
an
utterly
proper
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
whole
point
as
i
understand
it
is
simply
that
we
do
not
have
here
anything
that
smacks
in
the
slightest
of
choice
of
representatives?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
suggest
whether
or
not
the
county
may
or
may
not
have
a
particular
structure
of
government?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
whether
it
can
say,
even
though
there’s
a
majority
overall,
if
it’s
not
a
majority
of
the
aggregate
of
the
voters
of
the
townships,
then
the
county
may
not
have
that
formed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
apart
from
that
the
whole
theory
as
i
understand
you
of
reynolds
and
sims
and
that
line,
whole
line
of
cases
simply
is
inapplicable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
it
possible
that
if
this
is
a
valid
system
that
the
cities
might
override
township
interest
because
of
the
type
of
representation
they
get
in
county
government?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
might
end
up
with
the
county
constabulary,
is
it
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
are
you
