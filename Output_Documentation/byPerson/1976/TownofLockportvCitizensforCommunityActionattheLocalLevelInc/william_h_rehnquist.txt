in
new
york
state,
are
town
simply
geographical
areas
or
are
they
small
cities?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
whole
state
isn’t
divided
into
towns
in
the
way
some
new
england
states
have.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn’t
your
complaint
with
respect
to
that
really
that
the
new
york
officials
without
any
federal
court
order
had
already
put
into
effect
the
1974
charter?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
therefore,
there
was
no
need
to
litigate
with
respect
to
that
since
the
plaintiffs
had
already
obtained
what
they
wanted,
putting
that
charter
into
effect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
the
kinds
of
things
that
the
new
york
law
permits
to
be
done,
are
those
that
the
court
has
done
in
hunter
against
pittsburgh?

(voice

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
hadley
and
kramer
were
both
elections
to
representative
bodies
albeit
of
lesser
stature
than
state
legislature?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
town
functions
--
what
are
town
functions
in
your
view,
is
there
any
law
enforcement
function,
do
you
have
jps
or
elector
on
the
township
basis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
have
the
constable.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now
is
it
possible
that
if
the
county
develops
an
executive
--
what
do
you
have,
a
sheriff?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
if
the
sheriff’s
department
expands
a
great
deal
might
be
need
or
use
of
the
town
constable
be
diminished?
