justice
potter
stewart
and
the
county
is
either
city
or
town,
there’s
nothing,
no
part
of
county
that's
neither
city
nor
town,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
the
town
is
what
we
call
our
township.
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
in
our
three-judge
court?
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
any
reference
in
the
course
of
empaneling
a
three-judge
court
to
the
previous
action
in
which
a
single
judge
had
not
even
found
it
substantial
enough
to
ask
for
the
convention
of
a
three-judge
court?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
that
would
be
part
of
the
res
judicata,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
single
judge
had
found
it
so
and
substantial
is
not
even
to
warrant
a
request
for
the
convention
of
a
three-judge
court?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
two
charters?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
two
votes,
regardless
of
the
percentages
of
the
non-precise
numbers,
the
same,
factually
the
two
votes
are
identical?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
was
an
overall
majority
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
most
--
you
claim
that
the
court
did
follow
procedures
that
were
unusual,
if
not
irregular?
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
did
--
we
do
have
a
decision
before
us
affecting
the
1974
charter?
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
the
existing
charter?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
reasoning
of
its
original
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
you’ve
already
conceded
the
two
charters
for
these
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
purposes
of
this
case
are
identical?
justice
potter
stewart
originally,
that
doctrine
originally
arose
of
course
in
terms
of
what’s
called
representative
democracy
in
the
legislative
area,
and
then
it
was
expanded
to
include
one?
justice
potter
stewart
kolodziesjski
against
phoenix.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
and
then
also
in
the
school
district?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
state
of
new
york.
justice
potter
stewart
and,
of
course,
avery
involved
the
town
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
county.
justice
potter
stewart
and
hadley
against
the
junior
college
or
whatever
it
was?
justice
potter
stewart
you
know
that
went
pretty
far
away
from
legislative
apportionment,
didn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
rather
than
the
structure
of
the
governmental
entity
itself?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
it
clear,
may
i
ask
that
the,
that
the
new
charter
or
charters
affect
the
towns
quite
differently
from
the
way
they
affect
the
cities?
justice
potter
stewart
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
have
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
this
case
that
fact,
it
was
not
present?
justice
potter
stewart
so
there’s
no
real
rationale
behind
this
in
this
case,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
behind
requiring
a
majority
of
votes
of
the
town
and
the
majority
of
the
cities
separately?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
possible
that
the
status
quo
might
be
more
greatly
altered
with
respect
to
the
towns
than
with
respect
to
the
cities?
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
new
york.
new
york
law
provides
that
a
new
county
charter
will
go
into
effect
only
if
it
is
approved
in
a
referendum
election
by
separate
majorities
of
the
voter's
who
live
in
the
cities
within
the
county
and
of
those
who
live
outside
the
cities.
a
three-judge
federal
district
court
held
that
these
requirements
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
a
direct
appeal
brought
the
case
here.
for
the
reason
set
out
in
some
detail
in
the
written
opinion
of
the
court
filed
today,
we
have
concluded
that
the
provisions
of
new
york
law
here
in
question
no
more
than
recognized
the
substantially
different
electoral
interests
of
city
dwellers
and
non-city
dwellers
in
a
new
county
charter,
in
view
of
the
realities
of
the
overlapping
and
competing
local
governmental
units
in
the
political
structure
of
the
state.
granting
to
these
provisions
of
new
york
law,
the
presumption
of
constitutionality
to
which
every
duly
enacted
state
and
federal
law
is
entitled,
we
hold
that
they
do
not
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
accordingly,
the
judgment
is
reversed.
the
chief
justice
does
not
join
the
opinion
of
the
court,
but
concurs
only
in
the
judgment.
