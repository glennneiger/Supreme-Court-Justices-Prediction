unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
he
had
inherent
in
the
jury
system,
that
is
very
often,
juries
on
the
same
criminal
conduct
will
reach
different
results
of
man
slaughtering
in
one
state
might
be
murdering
in
other,
depending
on
the
attitudes
of
area.
unknown
speaker
we
do
not
sit
as
a
jury
to
review.
unknown
speaker
each
of
these
was
a
mandatory?
unknown
speaker
same
statute,
same
state,
both
mandatory
where
the
jury
did
not
have
any
discretion.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
in
both
cases
the
death
penalty
was
imposed.
but
in
the
washington
case,
this
court
has
set
aside
the
death
penalty.
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
mandatory
death
penalty.
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
saying
is
that
you
think
this
case
should
be
treated
exactly
the
same
as
washington
against
state.
unknown
speaker
i
think
we
have
made
a
mistake
in
taking
it
for
the
issues
that
are
proposed
here
for
discussion.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
order
in
the
case
you
are
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
order
of
this
court?
what
did
it
say?
unknown
speaker
just
what
did
the
order
say?
unknown
speaker
the
case
was
reversed
or
the
sentence
was
dissent.
unknown
speaker
what
did
it
ask
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
to
do?
unknown
speaker
the
proceeding
is
not
inconsistent.
unknown
speaker
it
was
remanded
for
re-sentencing
that
is
right
and
your
specific
holding
in
the
johnson
washington
case,
if
it
may
please
the
court
was...
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
it
there?
unknown
speaker
really,
that
is
what
you
are
asking
us
to
do
here.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
would
be
interested
in
your
opponent's
reaction
to
this
inquiry.
unknown
speaker
i
wonder
if
you
would
respond
to
his
views
about
the
jurisdictional
issue
that
he
has
now
raised.
unknown
speaker
mrs.
korn,
is
there
any
difference
between
the
cases?
unknown
speaker
so,
either
the
court
was
wrong
there
or
he
has
to
change
his
mind.
unknown
speaker
not
in
this
court?
have
you
applied...
unknown
speaker
and
what
happened?
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
no
petition
for
re-hearing
pending
here?
unknown
speaker
not
here.
unknown
speaker
it
was
directed
to
the
louisiana
court
and
that
is
still
pending.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
in
the
washington
case.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think,
they
are
holding
that
pending?
unknown
speaker
except,
for
the
fact
that
the
correctional
officer
is
unarmed.
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
they
are
unarmed
inside
the
walls.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
say
that
they
do
not
use
that
for
your
policeman.
unknown
speaker
from
the
question
of
the
merits
which
you
pressed
for
the
second
time,
do
you
challenge
mrs.
korns'
statement
that
your
client
was
trialed
right
from
the
place
where
he
shot
the
police
officers
and
found
them
in
house
with
the
gun?
is
that
being
questioned?
unknown
speaker
but
was
he
shot
in
the
leg?
