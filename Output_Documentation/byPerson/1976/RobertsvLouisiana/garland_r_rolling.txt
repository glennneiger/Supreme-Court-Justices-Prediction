mr.
garland
r.
rolling
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
garland
rolling.
i
am
here
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
harry
roberts.
harry
roberts
was
a
young
19-year-old
black
lad
who
was
convicted
by
the
criminal
district
court
for
the
parish
of
orleans
for
the
killing
of
a
police
officer
under
statute
rs
14:30
which
was
a
mandatory
death
penalty
statute.
part
of
which
has
been
approved
in
the
prejudice
to
this
case,
stanislaus
roberts
v.
louisiana.
i
find
myself
in
a
rather
unique
position
of
having
to
call
the
court's
attention,
a
possible
jurisdictional
problem
on
a
writ
that
i
applied
for,
in
occurrence
with
28
usc
1257.
if
it
may
please
the
court,
harry
roberts’
case
was
argued
and
submitted
in
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
the
death
sentence
was
affirmed
and
re-hearing
was
applied
before
it
was
denied
during
the
90-day
writ
period
across
the
stanislaus
robert's
case
came
down
from
this
court.
it
was
too
late
to
have
any
further
hearings
before
the
state
court,
so
we
want
to
have
with
the
writs
of
particular
court.
i
am
concerned
that
if,
it
may
please
the
court
that
had
the
louisiana
supreme
court
had
the
benefit
of
stanislaus
roberts
at
the
time
they
decided
harry
roberts
possibly
a
different
result
would
have
occurred.
stanislaus
robert,
as
you
know,
struck
down
section
1
of
the
rs
14:30
statute,
the
mandatory
death
penalty
for
the
killing
during
an
armed
robbery.
this
maybe
merely
academic
to
question
of
the
finality
of
judgments
because
certainly
if
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
sends
us
back
to
supreme
court
of
louisiana,
the
state
or
the
individual
could
apply
for
writs
and
be
backed
up
here
in
six
months
to
a
year.
but
i
did
not
want
to
cross
the
court’s
intention
to
whatever
consideration
they
may
want
to
give
it.
the
second
and
more
basic
consideration
that
we
are
asking
the
court
for,
on
behalf
of
harry
roberts
are
the
procedural
objections
that
we
have
to
the
manner
of
the
coaching
of
the
first-degree
murder
statute
in
louisiana
which
of
course
has
been
re-amended
and
re-affirmed
since
the
decisions
in
proffitt
v.
florida
and
gregg
v.
georgia,
and
the
up
cases
which
came
down
sometime
ago.
the
statute
provides,
of
course,
the
built-in
aggravated
circumstance
of
killing
a
police
officer.
it
would
have
been
interesting
in
the
outcome
of
this
case,
if
we
could
have
presented
the
various
mitigating
circumstances.
one
particular
instance
is
about
the
case
is
the
defendant
took
the
witness
stand
on
his
own
behalf
and
he
is
continually
and
vividly
denied
his
guilty
in
this
case,
and
said
it
was
a
case
of
misidentification.
there
was
evidence
both
ways,
the
jury
resolved
the
facts
against
him.
there
were
numerous
mitigating
circumstances
on
the
case.
the
boy
had
a
long
juvenile
record,
he
had
a
problematical
home,
he
had
a
long
history
of
mental
problems.
possibly,
if
we
would
have
an
opportunity
to
present
this
to
the
jury
and
accordance
with
those
standards
set
forth
in
gregg
v.
georgia
and
the
other
cases,
we
would
have
a
different
results
here,
we
would
not
have
the
death
penalty.
the
state
kept
the
benefit
of
the
one
aggravating
circumstance
which
was
resolved
against
the
defendant
but
the
defense
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
the
many,
many
mitigations
circumstance
which
we
were
not
allowed
to
present.
concerned
about
the
whole
question
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
and
i
may
take
them
the
minority
view,
quite
frankly.
i
personally
feel
that
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
by
giving
someone
life
imprisonment
is
far
more
severe
than
putting
someone
to
death
in
a
capital
case.
if
i
had
the
choice,
i
would
much
rather
be
put
to
death.
i
am
deeply
concerned
about
the
johnson
washington
case
which
has
not
been
bound
into
the
united
reports
wherein
my
good
friend,
ado
berry(ph)
who
resides
at
st.
charles
parish
and
who
was
a
police
officer
was
shot
down
and
killed
and
his
assailant
was
given
life
imprisonment
by
this
court
less
than
six
months
ago.
when
the
court
here
held
that
the
killing
of
the
deputy
sheriff
did
not
constitute
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
i
beg
your
pardon,
the
killing
of
a
deputy
sheriff,
requires
a
life
sentence
and
to
put
him
to
death
would
be
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
this
is
just
several
months
ago
by
this
court
and
the
case
of
course,
johnson
washington,
cited
right
here
in
my
brief,
and
it
rose
--
the
two
killings
arose
less
than
10
miles
apart
in
two
different
parishes
in
the
same
state.
and
it
is
very
difficult
for
me
to
understand
now
how
a
few
months
later,
harry
roberts
could
be
possibly
jeopardize
to...
mr.
garland
r.
rolling
if
it
may
please
the
court,
and
your
point
is
well
taken.
the
jury
can
reach
different
results
but
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
should
not
reach
different
results,
if
it
may
please
the
court,
three
months
apart,
whereas,
say,
where
one
man
can
be
put
to
death
in
march
1977
and
one
man
gets
life
in
december
1976.
mr.
garland
r.
rolling
yes
sir,
but
you
sit
as
a
court
to
tell
us
what
the
law
of
the
land
is
and
the
law
of
the
land
for
killing
the
deputy
sheriff
four
months
ago
was
life
imprisonment
and
now
we
appear
today
to
discuss
whether
the
law
of
land
will
be
death
for
killing
of
policeman.
i
am
very
bothered,
i
am
very
disturbed,
i
do
not
have
solution
to
it,
i
just
want
to
present
the
problem
to
the
court.
mr.
garland
r.
rolling
yes,
same
statute.
murders
took
place.
mr.
garland
r.
rolling
r.s.
1430,
killing
of
a
police
officer.
same
situation,
just
the
several
months
apart,
december
or
november
whatever
it
was.
it
was
life
imprisonment.
now
we
examine,
whether
it
should
be
death.
mr.
garland
r.
rolling
this
case
set
aside
the
death
penalty
in
november
and
december
and
sent
it
back
to
louisiana
supreme
court
and
said
that
the
death
penalty
for
killing
the
deputy
sheriff
--
mr.
garland
r.
rolling
a
mandatory
death
penalty
that
is
all
we
deal
we
here
today.
the
death
penalty
of
killing
of
a
deputy
sheriff
in
november
and
december
was
unconstitutional
life
imprisonment.
in
march,
we
are
discussing
whether
the
death
penalty
and
for
killing
a
policeman
in
an
adjourning
parish
is
constitutional
or
not.
i
am
concerned.
mr.
garland
r.
rolling
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
about
it.
mr.
garland
r.
rolling
well,
i
do
not
think
we
can
change
the
decision
of
this
magnitude
in
three
days,
at
least
in
three
months.
as
i
say
it
has
not
even
been
bound
into
legal
volumes
and
we
are
up
here
now
today
again
talking.
when
we
applied
for
writs
in
this
case,
we
expected
a
perfunctory
reversal
of
the
death
penalty
as
to
the
state,
as
to
the
legal
community.
mr.
garland
r.
rolling
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
the
johnson
washington
case?
mr.
garland
r.
rolling
the
order
of
this
court
said
that
johnson
washington
who
was
a
black
male
who
had
been
convicted
--
mr.
garland
r.
rolling
the
order
said
that
the
death
penalty
under
rs
14:30
which
is
the
same
statute,
we
are
dealing
with
here
today
was
inherently
unconstitutional,
it
constituted
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
under
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
case
was
reversed,
it
was
remanded
that
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
mr.
garland
r.
rolling
the
sentence
was
reversed.
mr.
garland
r.
rolling
it
simply
said
to
proceed
consistent
with
your
opinion
which
was
a
reversal,
which
was
a
set
aside
for
the
death
penalty
for
killing
of
a
deputy
sheriff.
mr.
garland
r.
rolling
right,
the
proceeding
is
not
inconsistent,
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
so,
we
set
the
penalty
aside.
but
if
the
penalty
was
set
aside
in
this
court
and
the
case
was
remanded
for
reconsideration.
mr.
garland
r.
rolling
no
sir,
i
do
not.
it
is
cited
on
my
brief.
mr.
garland
r.
rolling
well,
it
is
exactly
right.
i
do
not
see
how
we
can
turn
this
case
on
the
same
statute.
mr.
garland
r.
rolling
i
would
like
to
just
call
and
this
goes
as
approximately
the
argument
of
johnson
washington
is
printed
in
all
the
advance
sheets
and
the
court
is
much
more
familiar
with
it
than
i
am.
i
do
see
the
possibility
of
an
equal
protection
argument,
the
problem
of
who
do
we
protect
and
who
don’t
we
protect
are
particular
stats
that
we
are
dealing
with
here
today,
protects
the
deputy
sheriff,
the
policeman.
it
protects
the
game
warden,
for
example,
and
it
provides
a
death
penalty
of
the
game
wardens
killed,
but
it
doesn’t
unprotect
me
because
i
am
just
a
lawyer,
i
am
not
the
game
warden.
so,
what
do
we
do
the
list,
am
i
denied
equal
protection
because
the
game
wardens
is
protected
and
i
am
not
protected?
i
personally
feel
slighted
by
the
statute.
if
it
may
please
the
court,
i
may
further
go
on
to
say
that
there
are
some
witherspoon
problems
in
the
harry
robert’s
case
which
are
not
made
a
part
of
this
record
but
which
we
would
like
to
reserve
if
in
case
they
require
further
proceedings.
thank
you.
mr.
garland
r.
rolling
i
would
like
to
make
one
or
two
comments
to
that,
please.
mr.
garland
r.
rolling
as
this
occurred,
i
would
like
to
just
call
the
court's
attention
on
the
two
factors;
one
is
on
the
finality
of
the
johnson
washington
case
and
the
re-hearing
of
the
state
court.
i
think,
if
it
may
please
of
court,
law
is
that
the
at
the
johnson
washington
case
is
final,
when
you
denied
your
re-hearing
here,
it
certain
supersedes
any
potential
opinion
of
louisiana
supreme
court
could
render.
i
think
that
johnson
washington
will
be
in
jail
for
whatever
time,
the
law
prescribes
but
there
is
no
way
that
this
harry
roberts
case
will
in
any
way
affect
johnson
washington’s
case
because
of
your
previous
denial
of
a
re-hearing.
i
would
like
to
further
call
the
court's
attention
on
that,
have
a
basic
disagreement
with
my
colleague
mrs.
korns
on
my
right
under
this
existing
law
to
submit
mitigated
circumstances
to
the
jury
during
the
trial.
there
is
no
way
that
i
could
get
up
there,
or
any
other
counsel
would
get
up
there
and
spend
four
hours
before
the
jury
and
tell
the
jury
during
the
course
of
the
guilty
or
innocence
trial,
30
reasons
why
you
should
not
execute
this
particular
individual
without
saying
look,
ladies
and
gentleman
of
the
jury,
this
man
is
guilty
and
here's
why
you
should
not
execute
him.
in
fact,
it
would
not
even
have
a
guilty
or
innocence
trial
if
that
was
truly
prohibited
from
doing
it,
unless
you
want
to
place
yourself
in
that
particular
procedural
position.
the
last
thing
is,
part
of
it,
at
my
conclusion,
all
of
us
are
opposed
to
crime.
god
only
knows,
i
do
not
want
to
see
anybody
killed
particularly
police
officers
or
particularly
agents
of
the
state
or
anybody
at
all.
but
possibly
if
we
are
give
it
an
opportunity
to
have
these
sense
in
hearings
which
this
court
has
announced
as
a
principal
law
of
the
land
possibly
can
get
some
testimony,
possibly
can
look
into
the
background
of
some
of
these
criminals,
possibly
we
can
find
out
why
officer
mclnerney
was
killed,
and
remember
my
particular
client
denied
his
guilt
at
all
times
but
possibly
we
could
find
out,
what
is
wrong
and
what
we
can
do
as
individuals
are
human
beings
to
correct
this
people,
to
prevent
this
from
happening
in
the
future.
if
we
do
not
look
into
the
cause
of
the
crime,
we
never
are
going
to
find
out
what
to
do
to
prevent
the
crime.
mr.
garland
r.
rolling
my
client
testified,
got
on
the
witness
stand,
and
took
the
witness
stand,
and
remember
this
is
a
19-year-old
uneducated
youth
versus
the
full
force
in
effect
of
the
intellect
of
the
attorney
general’s
officers
in
state
of
louisiana
and
matched
with
the
attorney
general
for
an
hour
or
two
hours,
and
he
always
said
that
he
was
not
the
one
that
did
it.
this
is
mardi
gras
in
new
orleans.
there
are
9,000
people
who
wear
red
bandanas
on
their
head,
everybody
customs
there
was
a
million
people
on
the
street.
mr.
garland
r.
rolling
he
was
shot
in
the
leg
and
his
testimony
was
that
he
was
shot
in
the
leg
by
unknown
assailant
and
he
run
into
this
particular
house
to
use
the
phone
to
call
the
police
and
to
call
for
help.
now,
the
jury
resolved
the
facts
against
him.
i
do
not
know
who
is
right,
i
do
not
know
who
is
wrong.
i
do
not
know
which
facts
are
correct
or
which
facts
are
incorrect.
but
there
was
very
serious
factual
dispute
in
this
case.
we
lost,
and
i
can
certainly
understand
how
a
reasonable
man
could
have
resolved
the
facts
against
him.justice,
just
as
i
think
a
reasonable
man
could
have
resolved
the
facts
at
his
favor
and
nobody
really
knew
what
the
jury
was
going
to
do.
but
they
are
against
this
and
that
is
why
we
are
here.
thank
you,
it
was
my
pleasure
for
being
here.
