ms.
louise
korns
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
louisiana
is
of
the
respect
review
that
louisiana
revised
statute
rs
14:30
paragraph
2
which
provides
for
the
mandatory
death
sentence
for
first-degree
murder
of
the
intentional
killing
of
a
police
officer
in
the
performance
of
his
lawful
duty.
ms.
louise
korns
your
honor,
the
state’s
view
about
that
as
it
is
said
in
our
brief,
is
that,
if
he
wanted
more
consideration
in
the
louisiana
courts,
his
recourse
was
to
ask
for
habeas
corpus
and
the
setting
aside
the
death
sentence
than
to
urge
all
of
these
questions
relating
to
louisiana
courts
in
the
louisiana
courts
and
not
to
come
up
to
here
and
apply
for
certiorari.
we
feel
that
he
is
waived
all
of
this
by
applying
for
certiorari
and
particularly
after
this
court
issued
its
narrowing
order
on
november
28th
saying
it's
a
sole
issue
before
the
court
on
this
grant
of
certiorari
would
be
limited
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
mandatory
death
penalty
for
intentional
killing
of
a
police
officer
under
the
louisiana
first-degree
murder
law,
this
court
said
it.
ms.
louise
korns
distinguish
it
very
easily
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
court
did
not
write
an
opinion
in
that
case,
it
did
not
address
itself
to
the
issues.
it
just
said
that
the
sentence
was
set
aside
as
cruel
and
unusual,
that
it
could
not
be
carried
out,
it
would
be
cruel
and
unusual
to
carry
it
out,
stanislaus
roberts
v.
louisiana,
that
is
all.
the
court
never
addressed
itself
to
the
issues
and
frankly,
you
would
not
know
what
the
case
contained
unless
you
went
back
and
read
the
application
of
certiorari
and
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana’s
opinion.
it
is
an
order,
it
is
not
even
a
procuring
opinion,
it
is
just
an
order
of
this
court
and
the
state
does
not
see
how
an
order
without
reasons
can
be
binding
on,
unlike
--
there
was
no
oral
argument
on
it.
no
presentation
of
the
issues,
even
when
you
read
the
application
of
the
certiorari
and
johnson
washington,
it
does
not
focus
on
section
two
of
the
statute.
it's
just
attacks
the
whole
statute
just
like
--
ms.
louise
korns
factually,
your
honor,
there
is
not.
ms.
louise
korns
the
court
overlooks
the
sophistic
matter
of
issue.
i
beg
your
pardon.
ms.
louise
korns
justice
blackmun,
there
is
none.
in
both
cases,
the
accused
killed
a
police
officer.
in
both
cases,
he
was
prosecuted
for
first-degree
murder
on
the
louisiana
revised
statute,
section
2.
ms.
louise
korns
i
have
conceded
it,
it
is
identical.
however,
the
state
of
louisiana
feels
that
this
blanket
order
of
this
court
which
could
have
been
an
oversight
or
at
least
the
court
was
not
thinking,
let
us
put
it
in
the
words
of
gregg
and
its
progeny,
the
court
did
not
focus
on
the
specific
issues
which
were
presented
to
the
court
here.
that
is
the
difference
between
the
second
paragraph
of
article
30
and
the
first
paragraph
under
which
stanislaus
roberts
had
been
convicted
which
was
a
felony
murder
doctrine.
therefore
the
citing
of
stanislaus
roberts
for
the
dismissal
of
the
--
for
the
setting
aside
of
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
in
johnson
washington
just
was
not
in
point
because
stanislaus
roberts
deals
with
the
first
section
of
article
30
which
is
a
broad,
sweeping,
felony
murder
statute
which
says
that
anyone
who
commits
a
murder
while
engaged
in
the
commission
of
a
resided
number
of
felonies
like
arm
robbery
shall
be
mandatorily
sentenced
to
this.
ms.
louise
korns
your
honor,
i
wrote
that
application
and
i
did
not
give
any
thought
either
to
the
problem
of
differentiating
out
the
two.
ms.
louise
korns
i
think
i
said
that
if
this
court
did
not
grant
a
re-hearing
in
stanislaus
roberts,
the
state
of
louisiana
probably
could
not
execute
harry
roberts.
that
is
what
i
said
in
my
application.
no
doubt
about
it.
then
this
court
granted
certiorari
and
two
weeks
later
announced
this
order,
that
the
issue
for
decision
in
this
case
on
certiorari
before
this
court
would
be
the
constitutionality
of
the
mandatory
death
sentence
on
the
louisiana
law
for
the
intentional
killing
of
a
police
officer.
now,
the
state
of
louisiana
believes
that
this
case
can
be
very
easily
distinguished
from
the
stanislaus
roberts
case.
article
30
of
the
louisiana
criminal
code
before
it
was
amended
last
summer
following
this
courts
gregg,
et.
al
decisions
provided
that
first-degree
murder
is
the
killing
of
human
being.
now
the
first
sub-paragraph
of
that
article
was
the
stanislaus
roberts’
case,
the
felony
murder
doctrine
which
this
court
threw
out
in
stanislaus
roberts.
the
second
paragraph
is
the
one
under
which
the
present
case
and
johnson
washington
was
brought.
when
the
offender
has
a
specific
intent
to
kill
or
inflict
right
bodily
harm
upon
a
police
officer,
who
was
engaged
in
the
performance
of
his
duties.
now,
the
state
of
louisiana’s
position
is
that
this
is
clearly
distinguished
from
the
stanislaus
roberts
case
because
this
statute
is
now
withdrawn.
it
incorporates
a
statutory
aggravating
circumstance.
it
is
a
state
of
louisiana’s
position
that
there
are
no
mitigating
circumstances
possible
when
a
person
intentionally
kills
a
police
officer
in
the
performance
of
his
lawful
duty.
we
feel
that
because
of
the
trial
judges’
very
careful
instruction
to
the
jury
in
this
case
in
plain
everyday
language.
the
responsive
verdicts
did
not
give
the
jury
unfettered
discretion
and
that
no
appellate
review
was
necessary
on
the
narrow
issue
of
jury
capriciousness
and
so
forth
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court
because
of
the
narrow
statute
that
was
presented
to
the
jury.
in
other
words
to
bring
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
in
this
case,
which
would
necessarily
and
mandatorily
result
in
a
sentence
of
death
as
it
did,
the
jury
had
to
sharply
focus
on
a
very
narrow
set
of
circumstances
that
is
whether
the
accused
intentionally
killed
a
police
officer
who
was
in
the
performance
of
his
lawful
duty.
the
fact
in
this
case,
there
could
be
no
clearer
facts
in
such
an
issue.
it
was
a
mardi
gras
day
in
1974
and
harry
roberts
started
shooting
various
people
in
his
neighborhood
and
wounded
a
little
boy.
the
neighbors
called
the
police
and
officers
john
tobin(ph)
and
dennis
mclnerney
answered
the
call,
dressed
in
uniform
and
in
a
marked
police
car.
as
they
approached
the
scene
of
the
shooting,
they
were
told
by
a
by-stander
that
the
person
they
wanted
was
dressed
in
blue
trousers,
beige
shirt,
and
was
wearing
a
red
cap,
he
was
going
over
that
way.
they
proceeded
in
that
direction
and
just
turning
the
car,
and
they
saw
harry
roberts
taking
a
red
cap
off
his
head.
they
parked
their
police
car
at
an
angle,
right
in
front
of
roberts
to
get
out
and
talk
to
him.
roberts
walked
up
to
the
police
car
and
shot
officer
mclnerney.
officer
tobin,
as
he
sat
in
the
car,
officer
mclnerney
jumped
out
and
was
shot
and
mortally
wounded
by
roberts
at
this
time,
died
within
a
few
seconds.
officer
tobin,
although
wounded
was
able
to
draw
his
service
revolver
and
wound
roberts
in
the
leg.
there
upon,
roberts
ran
off
in
limping
and
leaving
a
trail
of
blood
and
took
refuge
in
a
neighboring
house
where
he
was
captured
a
few
minutes
later
by
police
officers
who
were
brought
to
the
scene
by
the
wounded
officer,
john
tobin.
now,
the
state
feels
that
if
ever
there
is
a
factual
circumstance
posing,
presenting
the
intentional
killing
of
a
police
officer
in
the
performance
of
his
lawful
duty,
this
is
it.
not
even
any
questions
to
the
man,
nothing
to
irritate
him
or
throw
him
off.
when
he
saw
the
police
car
stopped,
he
went
up
to
it
and
shot
the
first
officer
sitting
in
the
car.
the
second
officer
killed
him
as
he
got
out
to
question
him.
the
state
of
louisiana
feels
that
under
this
court’s
decision
in
gregg
v.
georgia,
proffitt
v.
florida
and
so
forth,
stanislaus
roberts
v.
louisiana,
in
which
this
court,
time
and
again,
in
footnotes
and
in
dicta
cut
out
from
its
opinion
narrow,
specifically
drawn
statute
which
focused
on
particular
circumstances
that
the
jury
would
have
before
them.
time
and
again,
this
court
cut
those
out.
that
is
what
we
have
here.
moreover,
this
court
in
those
cases,
specifically
approved
georgia’s
and
florida’s
bifurcated
jury
in
which
the
jury
was
to
consider
various
circumstances
aggravating
and
mitigating.
one
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
approved
by
this
court,
in
those
cases
was
the
circumstance
which
provided
which
the
jury
must
consider
on
to
florida
and
georgia
law
and
under
the
uniform
criminal
codes
and
that
are
universally
approved.
that
is
that
the
murderer
could
--
either
during
the
course
of
a
lawful
arrest
or
that
the
person
intentionally
killed
was
a
uniformed
police
officer
or
police
officer
on
duty.
it
elements
to
the
same
thing,
a
peace
officer
in
the
performance
of
his
lawful
duty,
the
louisiana
statute
presents
this
very
clearly
to
the
jury.
so,
it
is
narrowly
drawn,
it
incorporates
an
aggravating
circumstance.
now,
the
state
of
louisiana
takes
the
position
that
there
are
no
mitigating
circumstances
that
need
to
be
given
to
the
jury
when
a
police
officer
on
duty
is
killed.
it
is
as
simple
as
that.
if
our
society
is
to
exist
and
if
one
or
two
policeman
are
going
to
control
groups
of
violent
people,
mobs,
and
so
forth,
continually
being
called
to
investigate
dangerous
situations
such
as
we
have
in
the
present
case,
that
there
are
no
mitigating
circumstances
which
will
excuse
a
person
for
gunning
down
a
police
officer
engaged
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
and
is
therefore,
the
lack
of
mitigating
circumstances
having
been
presented
to
the
jury
in
a
special
sentencing
procedure.
of
course,
all
these
mitigating
circumstances
can
always
be
presented
to
the
jury
during
the
trial
on
the
merits.
in
argument
to
the
juries,
anything
like
insanity
or
drunkenness
or
youth
or
first
defender
can
always
be
presented
to
the
jury
in
the
trial
on
the
merits,
it
is
not
as
though
they
don’t
hear
mitigating
circumstances.
and
state
of
louisiana
further
believes
that
the
responsive
verdict
system
which
this
court
seemed
to
disapprove
of
in
stanislaus
roberts,
in
no
way
invalidates
the
present
mandatory
death
sentence
because
of
the
trial
judge's
instructions
which
we
have
forwarded
to
this
court,
which
were
not
included
in
the
record
but
we
have
sent
to
this
court.
this
court
will
see
that
the
trial
judge
very
patiently
and
in
everyday
language
explained
to
the
jury,
that
first-degree
murder
and
he
would
be
sentenced
to
death,
if
you
find
so
and
so,
if
you
find
that
he
was
not
a
police
officer,
second-degree
murder.
if
you
find
that
there
was
provocation,
man
slaughter
and
so
forth.
for
the
same
reason,
we
feel
that
the
lack
of
appellate
review
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court
does
not
invalidate
the
mandatory
death
sentence
here
either
because
of
the
fact
that
the
jury
in
effect
was
given
such
strict
guidelines
for
its
deliberations
and
whether
it
should
bring
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
as
charged
which
would
result
in
a
mandatory
death
sentence
that
there
was
no
leeway
for
capriciousness
and
so
forth
which
this
court
deplored
in
gregg
v.
georgia
and
stanislaus
roberts
and
so
forth.
so,
if
the
court
has
no
questions
herein.
ms.
louise
korns
mr.
justice
stevens,
such
a
question
has
never
presented
itself
as
far
as
i
know,
you
see,
in
the
instant
case,
the
officer
was
dressed
in
uniform
and
they
were
riding
in
a
police
car
and
there
is
no
doubt
about
it.
now
the
trial
judge
in
the
present
case
said
that
the
difference
between
the
guilty
as
charge
which
will
result
in
a
mandatory
death
sentence
and
first
responsive
verdict
of
guilty
as
second-degree
murder,
but
the
one
element
of
difference
in
the
crimes
would
be
that
the
victim
was
a
police
officer.
ms.
louise
korns
i
am
sure,
he
would
have
and
i
would
say
that
it
would
have
to
be
reasonably
apparent
that
the
man
was
a
police
officer.
i
would
think
but
the
court
has
not
passed
on
it.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
your
honor,
it's
pending
on
applications
for
re-hearing
in
the
louisiana
supreme
court
on
application
of
the
state.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
korns
we
applied
for
a
re-hearing
in
this
court
at
the
same,
we
applied
for
re-hearing
in
stanislaus
roberts.
ms.
louise
korns
this
court
denied
the
re-hearing
in
both.
ms.
louise
korns
not
here.
ms.
louise
korns
i
understood
mr.
justice
--
ms.
louise
korns
it
is
pending.
ms.
louise
korns
the
johnson
washington
case,
he
being
also
convicted
of
a
murder
of
a
peace
officer,
a
sheriff
ado
burry(ph).
ms.
louise
korns
i
am
sure
they
are.
any
further
questions
from
the
court
on
state
of
louisiana
or
the
rest.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
