mr.
jules
e.
orenstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
jules
e.
orenstein,
an
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
of
counsel
to
the
amicus
curiae
in
this
case,
the
honorable
louis
j.
lefkowitz,
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york.
we
appear
here
in
support
of
the
position
of
the
state
of
louisiana
and
in
support
of
the
concept
that
a
mandatory
death
penalty
for
the
killing
of
a
police
officer
is
constitutionally
acceptable.
of
necessity,
our
argument
must
be
of
an
empirical
or
pragmatic
nature.
our
starting
point,
i
think,
as
far
as
our
position
is
concerned
has
its
genesis
and
the
plurality,
footnote
7,
i
believe
in
the
case
decided
last
july,
in
woodson
v.
north
carolina.
as
we
read
that
footnote
and
the
opinion
of
the
plurality
and
the
comments
by
other
justices
of
this
court
and
their
dissents.
there
was
reserve
for
a
future
date,
the
determination
of
the
question
whether
or
not,
a
unique
category
of
homicidal
offense
could
in
certain
circumstances
justify
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
we
say
that
the
killing
of
a
police
officer
is
another
one
of
those
few
narrow
situations
in
which
the
infliction
of
the
death
penalty
mandatorily
will
sufficiently
justify
under
today’s
contemporary
standard,
the
infliction
of
this
particular
death
penalty.
just
this
last
week,
within
the
last
week,
last
tuesday
in
regard
with
the
florida
case,
there
were
some
words
by
the
plurality
in
that
decision
which
i
think
are
very
pertinent
here.
this
court,
plurality
opinion
stated
it
is
a
vital
importance
to
the
defendant
and
the
community
that
any
decision
to
impose
this
death
sentence
be
and
appear
to
be
based
on
reason
rather
than
caprice
or
emotion.
i
think
if
we
had
ever
had
a
situation
where
the
death
penalty
could
be
imposed
mandatorily
based
upon
reason,
we
have
those
reasons
here
in
the
situation;
the
limited
narrow
situation
where
a
police
officer
has
been
killed
in
the
line
of
duty
by
a
person
who
knew
or
should
have
known
that
the
gentleman
who
he
killed
was
a
police
officer.
empirically,
we
have
seen
some
statistics
cited
by
our
fellow
amici
at
the
joint,
as
i
term
it,
the
joint
law
enforcement,
amici
brief
by
the
national
district
attorneys,
association
american’s
for
law
enforcement,
international
conference
of
police
chiefs,
and
the
national
sheriffs
association.
i
think,
the
thing
that
really
screams
and
cries
out
for
a
ruling
of
protection
for
this
class
of
victim,
the
peace
officer,
all
of
the
statistics
that
have
been
compiled,
namely
from
1966
through
1975
inclusive,
you
had
1203
police
officers
killed
in
the
line
of
duty.
the
numbers
doubled
between
1966,
when
you
had
50
and
some
odd
officers,
they
went
into
the
120s
and
130s
by
the
time
we
hit
the
70s,
i
think
the
latest
figure
in
1974
was
132,
we
had
a
129
in
1975.
now,
this
ought
to
tell
us
something.
we
have
been
speaking
in
terms
and
i
believe
the
plurality
opinion
and
most
of
the
opinions
of
this
court,
since
last
july
have
spoken
in
terms
of
the
need
for
the
protection
of
society
or
the
general
need
to
protect
society.
but
i
think
here,
we
have
a
special
category
or
group
which
deems
it
necessary
to
have
a
specific
protection
of
that
group.
these
people
are
exposed,
their
exposure
is
terrible
and
it
is
constant.
the
figures
justify
the
statement.
if
as
this
court
has
stated
with
regard
to
the
correctional
officer
that
he
may
be
deemed
the
unique
circumstance,
if
he
happens
to
be
killed
in
the
line
of
duty
while
guarding
some
prisoners
in
a
correctional
setting.
the
exposure
of
those
correctional
officers
is
far
less
than
the
exposure
of
the
police
officer
who
is
in
the
line
of
duty.
mr.
jules
e.
orenstein
some
maybe,
mr.
justice.
mr.
jules
e.
orenstein
well,
there
may
be,
i
think,
there
is
a
justifiable
reason
for
that
if
they
are
unarmed
because
they
do.
mr.
jules
e.
orenstein
well,
you
do
have
more
of
a
controlled
setting
and
i
think
the
reason
this
court
may
have
--
one
of
the
reasons,
this
court
set
forth.
mr.
jules
e.
orenstein
well
exactly,
that
is
the
point
i
make
mr.
justice
marshall,
he
is
exposed.
certainly,
there
would
be
no
deterrence
in
the
correctional
officers’
situation
if
the
officer
was
killed
by
a
life-timer
and
what
does
the
perpetrator
have
to
look
forward
to
in
anticipation
of
further
or
increased
punishment.
you
have
done
actually
nothing
to
him
and
in
fact
all
you
have
done
is
encouraged
him
to
possibly
kill
or
murder
the
correctional
officer.
mr.
jules
e.
orenstein
well,
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
what
they
do
in
the
other
states
but
i
know
a
certain
state
such
as
the
state
i
represent,
certainly
have
a
problem
in
the
criminal
justice
field
and
we
certainly
have
problems
which
are
unique
and
different
not
only
in
the
number
of
crimes
committed
but
in
the
type
of
crimes
committed.
all
urban
areas,
i
think,
have
far
greater
problem
and
say
a
like
the
state
with
all
do
respect
to
our
sister
state
of
maine,
they
do
not
have
a
situation
we
have.
they
do
not
have
the
constant
headlines
screaming
about
homicides
not
only
of
correctional
people
or
peace
officers
but
ordinary
citizens
who
have
been
the
subject
or
victim
of
a
homicide.
i
would
also
like
to
emphasize
and
i
have
set
forth
certain
portions
within
our
brief
of
the
experience
factor
that
certain
police
officer
personnel
have
experienced.
now,
they
say
from
their
experience,
statistics
aside
that
when
they
have
talked
to
possible
perpetrators
or
perpetrators
in
the
past,
they
have
found
that
the
threat
of
a
possible
death
penalty
may
very
possibly
and
in
fact,
in
case
it
has
stated
that
trigger
finger
or
whatever
other
weapon
was
to
be
used
from
inflicting
the
assault
or
murder
upon
the
police
officer.
in
addition,
i
think
the
statistics
of
the
california
and
the
joint
law
enforcement
amici
brief
set
forth
the
number
of
assaults
upon
police
officers,
in
the
year
1975
along
which
exceeded
over
44,000
assaults.
i
think,
it
was
44,800
and
some
odd
number
of
assaults
close
to
45,000.
in
addition,
plurality
of
this
court
in
the
woodson
and
the
stanislaus
roberts
cases
spoke
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
there
was
defective
in
these
courts,
in
the
plurality
opinion,
the
fact
that
in
a
mandatory
situation,
there
was
no
one
to
really
pass
upon
such
--
this
nature
of
the
crime,
the
character
or
record
of
the
particular
defendant.
now,
i
say
and
we
say
in
this
particular
situation
dealing
with
law
enforcement
personnel.
the
nature
of
the
crime
speaks
for
itself.
you
have
a
police
officer;
the
elements
are
there,
the
intentional
killing
of
a
police
officer
on
duty.
the
act
itself
by
the
defendant
or
perpetrator
of
killing
a
police
officer
under
these
circumstances
certainly,
gives
us
an
idea
as
to
his
character.
another
interesting
statistic
i
think
which
may
feel
the
gap
in
the
minds
of
some
members
of
this
court
with
respect
to
the
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
record
of
the
perpetrator,
can
be
found
in
those
statistics
on
page
12
of
the
amici
brief,
the
joint
law
enforcement
brief,
where
they
set
forth
a
very
telling
factor.
a
1438
persons
identified
in
the
killing
of
law
enforcement
officers
between
1966
and
1975,
76%
of
them
had
records
of
prior
encounters
with
the
criminal
justice
process
and
of
that
number
56%
had
previous
records
convictions.
so,
taking
these
factors
all
together,
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
one
can
harmonize
these
particular
groups
of
peace
officers
and
their
particular
situation
with
the
recent
july
opinions
of
this
court
including
the
plurality
opinion.
we
think
we
can
satisfy
and
have
satisfied
the
fact
that
these
factors
are
present.
they
are
built
in,
they
are
subsumed
by
a
jury
verdict
finding
a
particular
perpetrator
of
not
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
new
york
and
many
of
our
jurisdictions,
there
is
fair
opportunity
to
present
many
of
the
conventional
defenses
that
one
finds
in
the
criminal
trial
process.
mr.
jules
e.
orenstein
i
suggested
in
our
brief
mr.
justice
stewart
that
one;
it
was
very
possible
for
this
court
to
have
overlooked
the
situation
that
we
were
dealing
with
peace
officers.
i
pointed
out
that
at
that
time,
on
july
6th,
i
believe
it
was,
this
court
came
down
with
many,
many
orders,
i
think
i
counted
34
to
36,
in
which
numerous
petitions
for
certiorari
which
involved
the
death
penalty
from
north
carolina,
louisiana,
and
oklahoma
was
summarily
reversed,
i
see
my
time
is
up.
do
you
wish
me
to
continue?
mr.
jules
e.
orenstein
that
is
my
answer
sir.
i
think
there
was
a
mistake
made;
otherwise
we
would
not
be
here
today.
thank
you
for
the
honor
and
privilege.
yes,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
jules
e.
orenstein
oh
it
has,
we
do
presently
have
two
people
on
death
row,
one
for
the
killing
of
an
officer,
a
police
officer
in
the
line
of
duty,
and
the
other
the
killing
of
a
correctional
officer
by
a
person
who
is
already
charged
with
murder.
thank
you
for
the
honor
and
privilege
of
appearing
here.
