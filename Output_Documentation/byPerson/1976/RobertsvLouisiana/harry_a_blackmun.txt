justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mrs.
korns,
how
do
you
distinguish
in
washington
v.
louisiana?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
you
face
that
way,
we
cannot
hear
you
here.
do
you
say
that
there
is
no
factual
distinction?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
our
impression
or
my
impression
and
i
just
wanted
your
concession
that
you
have
conceded
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mrs.
corns,
may
i
interrupt
with
one
other
question.
if
the
court
did
make
a
mistake
in
the
stanislaus
or
the
washington
case,
did
not
the
state
of
louisiana
make
precisely
the
same
mistake
in
its
response
to
the
petition
for
certiorari?
did
not
the
state
also
construe
the
first
roberts’
cases,
covering
this
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now
you
read
the
prior
roberts’
opinion
that's
covering
this
situation.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mrs.
corns,
i
have
a
question.
what
is
happened
in
the
washington
case?
have
you
filed
a
petition
for
re-hearing?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
remains
un-acted
upon
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
has
confused
the
new
york
situation
under
your
statute
for
you
haven’t
it?
