ms.
jane
e.
bloom
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
essential
issues
in
this
case.
first,
whether
debtors
who
have
disobeyed
the
subpoena
issued
by
a
creditors
attorney,
maybe
jailed
for
up
to
90
days.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
no,
it
is
not.
it
was
signed
by
the
creditor’s
attorney.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
whether
these
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
yes,
he
is.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
yes,
and
i
don’t
question
his
authority
to
issue
it,
and
i
don’t
question
the
fact
that
the
debtors
in
this
case
disobeyed
the
subpoenas.
the
question
is,
whether
or
not
debtors
maybe
jailed
for
up
to
90
days
for
disobeying
the
subpoena
without
ever
appearing
before
a
judge
and
without
ever
being
advised
of
their
right
to
counsel
or
assign
counsel
of
indigent.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
that’s
correct.
they
did
have
an
opportunity.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
i
would
agree,
mr.
justice
marshall.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
no,
no.
i
would
contend
that
when
an
individual
maybe
jailed
for
up
to
90
days
that
the
person
must
be
brought
before
the
court
prior
to
incarceration.
i
would
agree
that
in
the
due
process
analysis,
the
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
no,
but
we
have
a
different
situation
there.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
yes,
he
did.
what
i’d
like
to
do
is
to
clarify
exactly
what
happened
when
that
show
cause
order
was
issued.
and
i
would
like
to
clarify
the
statutory
procedure
by
outlining
how
the
statutes
operated
with
respect
to
patrick
ward.
i
would
maintain
that
everything
that
happened
to
patrick
ward
was
permitted
under
the
statutes.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
he
is
one
of
the
named
plaintiffs,
that’s
correct.
i
might
add
that
patrick
ward’s
affidavit
is
verified
and
it
is
un-controverted.
the
creditor’s
attorneys
never
answered
the
complaint.
a
default
judgment
was
taken
against
patrick
ward
in
city
court
in
the
city
of
poughkeepsie
for
non-payment
of
a
$125
medical
bill.
the
creditors’
attorney
then
issued
a
subpoena
ordering
ward
to
appear
for
a
disclosure
deposition
at
the
court
house.
the
court
house
was
designated
at
the
location
not
because
a
judge
was
involved
in
these
proceedings,
but
because
that
was
the
requested
location.
ward
appeared
as
instructed.
when
the
attorney
did
not
appear,
a
clerk
instructed
ward
to
go
the
attorney’s
office.
ward
went
to
the
office
and
told
the
attorney
that
he
would
produce
the
information
at
the
court
house
but
not
at
the
attorney’s
office.
he
essentially
did
not
understand
the
purpose
or
meaning
of
the
subpoena.
based
upon
ward’s
refusal
to
provide
this
information,
the
creditor’s
attorney
instituted
civil
contempt
proceedings
to
enforce
compliance
with
the
subpoena.
he
served
ward
with
a
notice
of
motion
to
hold
him
in
contempt.
now
under
757
of
the
judiciary
law,
the
proceedings
maybe
commenced
by
a
show
cause
order
or
a
warrant
of
attachment
or
by
the
creditor’s
attorney
issuing
a
notice
of
motion.
if
we
examine
the
show
cause
order
which
appears
at
page
12
of
my
brief
and
in
757,
the
order
does
not
inform
the
debtor
that
failure
to
appear
may
result
in
incarceration
or
a
fine.
it
informs
him
at
this
point
that
failure
to
appear
may
result
in
a
finding
of
contempt.
when
ward
received
the
notice
of
this
hearing,
he
contacted
the
creditor’s
attorney
and
arranged
to
satisfy
the
judgment
by
paying
$10.00
a
week
to
the
attorney.
he
did
not
go
to
the
court
hearing.
he
was
again
under
the
mis-impression
that
he
didn’t
have
to.
three
weeks
later,
ward
was
laid
off
from
his
job
and
told
the
creditor’s
attorney
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
continue
making
payments.
three
months
later,
ward
was
served
with
the
contempt
order.
he
was
held
in
contempt
for
his
failure
to
obey
the
subpoena,
not
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
that’s
correct.
now,
he
was
held
in
contempt
for
his
failure
to
obey
the
subpoena
not
his
failure
to
appear
in
court.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
for
not
obeying
the
subpoena.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
the
original
subpoena.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
that’s
correct,
he
did
not
obey
it.
and
he
was
held
in
contempt
for
refusing
to
obey
the
subpoena
issued
by
the
creditor’s
attorney,
not
for
failing
to
appear
in
court.
if
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
that’s
correct.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
well,
he
had
not
technically
given
the
information.
he
had
appeared
and
gotten
confused
about
the
fact
that
the
subpoena
told
him
to
go
to
the
courthouse,
he
was
directed
to
go
to
the
attorney’s
office
and
he
said
“i’ll
give
you
the
information
at
the
courthouse.”
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
well,
under
new
york
law,
the
fact
that
he
got
further
notice
to
go
to
the
attorney’s
office
is
sufficient,
and
he
couldn’t
be
held
in
contempt.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
that’s
correct,
and
under
new
york
procedure
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
exactly.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
the
appellate
term.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
i
am
not
suggesting
that.
i
am
suggesting
as
we
will
see
as
these
procedures
follow
that
individuals
maybe
incarcerated
who
are
on
public
assistance,
or
have
other
forms
of
exempt
income
before
they
realize
that
before
they
have
an
opportunity
to
appeal
and
that
they
suffer
this
kind
of
injury
before
they
are
aware
of
appellate
procedures.
secondly,
since
they
do
not
have
an
attorney
they
may
not
know
that
they
have
these
defenses
and
they
may
not
use
the
procedures
as
they
might
otherwise.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
yes
they
do.
let
me
just
respond
to
that
and
clarify
what
i’ve
just
said.
the
procedure
that
patrick
ward
would
have
had
to
use
to
stop
the
proceedings
against
him,
after
the
contempt
order
was
issued,
was
to
make
a
motion
to
vacate
the
contempt
order.
he
would’ve
gone
back
before
the
county
court
judge
that
issued
initial
contempt
order,
and
he
could’ve
gotten
a
stay
at
that
point.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
they
might
have,
and
that
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
they
certainly
might
have,
and
we
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
well,
the
court
still
has
an
inherent
contempt
power
and
the
only
thing
that
they
can’t
do
is
to
incarcerate
individuals.
they
can
clearly
fine
them.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
i
don’t
question
that
the
new
york
courts
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
yes,
i
do.
i
think
that
statutes
that
put
--
the
statutes
that
were
declared
unconstitutional,
yes.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
if
you
want
to
clear
that
my
constitutionals
applied
that
would
satisfy
our
interests.
i
feel
that
whenever
individuals
are
incarcerated,
without
an
attorney
and
without
ever
appearing
before
a
judge
there
is
such
a
high
risk
that
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
if
that
was
the
procedure
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
no,
if
that
was
the
procedure
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
if
that
was
the
procedure
i
would
say
that
that
comports
with
due
process.
the
problem
that
occurs
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
if
the
person
is
was
advised
by
his
attorney
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
alright,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
if
the
individual
is
--
if
the
judge
issues
a
bench
warrant,
generally
the
individual
is
brought
before
the
court.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
they
are
two
different
situations
in
this
case
though.
first
of
all
is,
the
proceedings
indicate
the
individual
is
never
held
in
contempt
for
willfully
disobeying
a
court
order.
there
was
never
any
finding
that
the
individual
willfully
failed
to
appear
at
the
show
cause
hearing,
or
willfully
failed
to
pay
the
fine.
the
statutes
indicate
that
an
individual
can
be
incarcerated
if
he
neglects
or
refuses
to
pay
the
fund.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
no,
if
we
look
at
the
statutes
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
you
are
in
2
(a)
of
the
decision?
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
yes,
he
does.
and
i
would
contend
that
if
we
were
talking
about
property
that
an
opportunity
for
hearing
would
be
enough.
i
would
maintain
that
since
we
are
talking
about
depriving
an
individual
of
liberty
that
more
due
process
must
attach.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
let
me
return
to
that.
okay.
three
months
later
ward
was
served
with
a
contempt
order.
ward
was
held
in
contempt
for
his
failure
to
obey
the
subpoena
and
not
his
failure
to
obey
the
--
or
appear
in
response
to
the
show
cause
order.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
correct,
that
was
authorized
by
the
statute.
the
statute
--
it’s
in
the
defining
order.
according
to
770,
the
court
issued
the
order
based
upon
a
creditor’s
affidavit
indicating
that
ward
willfully
disobeyed
the
subpoena
and
that
this
impaired
the
creditor’s
rights.
the
contempt
order
directed
ward
to
pay
$250.00
plus
court
cost
to
the
creditor
within
30
days
or
face
incarceration.
now
under
773
of
the
statutes,
as
the
creditor
chose
not
to
prove
that
he
had
suffered
any
loss,
the
court
imposed
the
fine
of
$250.00
plus
cost,
even
though
the
underlying
judgment
was
$146.00
and
the
creditor
received
the
entire
$250.00
plus
cost,
plus
attorney’s
fees.
when
ward
received
this
order,
his
income
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
yes,
i
do.
i
would
suggest
that
a
civil
contempt
fine
can
be
either
compensatory
or
coercive
and
that
a
fine
of
this
type
is
not
compensatory
because
it
is
not
related
to
the
underlying
judgment.
it
is
also
not
coercive
because
the
individual
is
fined
until
he
--
he
is
jailed
until
he
pays
the
fine.
he
is
not
jailed
until
he
provides
the
information.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
no.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
no,
the
judgment
creditor
under
the
statute
is
entitled
to
$250.00
without
proving
that
he
suffered
any
loss,
meaning
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
well,
if
the
underlying
debt
is
$10.00,
he
can
still
get
$250.00
and
keep
it.
he
is
then
entitled
to
cost
above
that,
and
entitled
to
attorney’s
fees
above
that.
the
fine
is
not
coercive,
because
the
individual
who
remained
in
jail
until
the
fine
is
paid,
the
individual
doesn’t
remain
in
jail
until
he
provides
the
information.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
i
will
finish.
when
ward
received
the
contempt
order,
his
income
consisted
of
$61.00
a
week
on
an
employment
insurance
benefit
with
$30.00
of
that
going
to
his
ex-wife
pursuant
to
a
new
york
family
court
support
order.
the
instant
action
prevented
the
proceedings
from
going
any
further
with
respect
to
ward.
when
other
debtors
failed
to
pay
the
contempt
fine,
the
court
issued
a
warrant
of
commitment
based
again
on
a
creditor’s
affidavit
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
yes,
i
am.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
ultimately,
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
issued
by
federal
court
and
he
was
not
incarcerated.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
that’s
correct,
and
as
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
that
was
a
valid
order.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
well,
as
i
indicated
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
that’s
correct,
he
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
that’s
correct.
he
went
to
the
attorney’s
office
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
--
and
he
went
to
the
attorney’s
office
and
told
the
attorney
that
he
would
pay
$10.00
a
week,
and
failed
to
appear.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
well,
what
happened
in
essence
was
that
he
did
not
appear
at
the
required
hearings.
however
he
contacted
the
creditor’s
attorney
and
tried
to
explain
and
tried
to
explain
what
happened.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
that’s
right,
that’s
right.
what
he
did
amounts
to
civil
contempt.
i
am
not
questioning
that.
i
am
questioning
the
procedures
that
were
used
to
fine
and
possibly
incarcerate
him
as
a
punishment
for
civil
contempt.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
if
he
had
ignored
a
support
order
and
the
support
order
was
issued
by
a
new
york
family
court
judge,
he
would
have
had
--
and
if
he
did
not
appear
at
an
initial
show
cause
hearing,
the
court
would
physically
bring
him
before
the
family
court,
and
ask
him
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
they
issue
what’s
called
a
writ
of
attachment,
and
the
sheriff
goes
out,
picks
up
the
person
and
brings
him
before
the
court.
and
a
hearing
would
have
been
held
at
that
time
to
determine
why
he
didn’t
pay
the
support
order.
he
also
would’ve
been
provided
with
--
he
would
have
been
informed
of
his
right
to
counsel
and
he
would’ve
been
informed
that
he
had
a
right
to
assigned
counsel,
if
he
was
indigent.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
it
is
followed
only
in
support
actions
and
family
court.
the
irony
of
the
situation
is
that
a
creditor
or
an
attorney
in
the
support
and
alimony
situation
has
the
option
of
either
using
the
family
court
procedures
which
provide
the
procedural
safeguards
that
we’re
asking
for
here
or
the
procedures
in
the
judiciary
law
which
provide
none
of
those
procedural
safeguards.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
well,
the
procedures
would
be
those
found
in
the
judiciary
law
in
the
challenge
sections
of
the
civil
contempt
statutes.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
yes,
it
would.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
i
believe
that
a
law
like
this
can
be
struck
down
on
its
face
because
the
statutory
procedures
that
operated
with
the
respect
to
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
were
permitted
under
the
statute.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
i
believe
that
he
district
court
could
have
held
these
statutes
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
these
plaintiffs
or
unconstitutional
on
their
face.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
yes,
they
are.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
i
would
say
that
a
statutory
procedure
that
permits
people
to
end
up
in
jail
without
ever
seeing
a
judge
or
an
attorney
can
be
declared
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
there
is
no
way
that
you
can
read
it
to
make
it
constitutional.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
that’s
correct.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
but
the
essential
difference
there
is
that
that
person
has
a
right
to
an
attorney
and
that
attorney
will
explain
to
him
the
consequences
that
will
result.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
that’s
correct.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
one
plaintiff
did,
rabasco.
he
went
into
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
in
this
case.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
this
individual
did
not.
another
plaintiff
did,
and
he
was
told
by
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
did
it
in
a
support
in
alimony
situation.
he
was
told
that
there
was
no
right
to
assign
counsel.
his
affidavit
is
also
un-controverted.
the
defendants
in
the
lower
court
did
not
answer
or
respond
to
his
affidavit.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
we
could
have
raised
these
constitutional
issues
in
state
court.
we
felt
with
respect
to
patrick
ward.
with
respect
to
individuals
such
as
harry
vail,
we
could
have
appealed
on
his
behalf.
the
problem
in
his
case
though
is
that
we
maintain
that
he
suffered
too
much
injury
by
the
time
he
got
to
the
appellate
level.
he
was
incarcerated
and
his
entire
income
was
exempt
from
the
execution.
he
could’ve
appealed
to
get
that
money
back,
there
would
be
no
way
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
if
he
had
counsel
he
could
have,
that’s
correct.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
that’s
correct.
i
am
treating
them
not
as
a
criminal
case
for
the
due
process
protections
that
i
believe
are
required
here
but
a
case
in
which
an
individual
is
deprived
of
liberty
and
that
can
occur
in
many
civil
contexts.
it
can
occur
in
civil
commitment
context
and
others.
and
i
believe
that
for
due
process
reasons
that
an
individual
must
be
assigned
a
lawyer
and
must
appear
before
a
judge
before
that
individual
can
be
incarcerated
for
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
yes,
i
believe
that
he
doesn’t
need
to
be
given
ten
opportunities
to
show
up.
what
needs
to
happen
is
to
have
him
physically
brought
before
the
court
as
in
the
new
york
family
court
procedure.
so
that
a
court
can
make
a
reasoned
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
this
person
belongs
in
jail.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
well,
what
happened
here
--
first
of
all
i
think
that
the
statutes
must
be
viewed
as
purely
civil
statutes.(b)
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
the
statute
says
that,
they
play
no
part
in
criminal
law
enforcement.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
no,
it
wasn’t
but
the
statutes
in
that
case
were
used
in
aid
of
criminal
statutes
and
the
essential
difference
is
that
the
proceedings
were
initiated
by
the
state.
in
this
case,
we
have
private
individuals
initiating
proceedings
and
there
is
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
i
believe
that
there
is
an
essential
difference.
i
believe
that
we
first
have
to
look
at
what
it
is
that
individuals
are
held
in
contempt
for.
they
are
not
being
held
in
contempt
as
would
be
the
case
in
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding
for
willfully
disobeying
a
court
order.
they’re
being
held
in
contempt
for
willfully
disobeying
a
subpoena
issued
by
a
creditor’s
attorney.
there
is
a
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
correct.
however,
the
order
--
the
ultimate
contempt
order
holds
an
individual
in
contempt
not
for
intentionally
disobeying
that
court
order.
the
standard
is
one
of
neglect
or
refusal.
if
an
individual
breaks
a
leg
on
his
way
to
the
courthouse
and
doesn’t
appear
for
the
show
cause
hearing,
he
has
neglected
to
obey
that
court
order.
and
if
he
intentionally
disobeyed
the
subpoena,
a
contempt
order
could
properly
issue.
going
back
to
mr.
justice
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
he
could
be
held
in
contempt
in
his
absence,
that
is
my
point
and
because
he
has
been
held
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
correct.
however,
my
point
is
that
that
may
not
happen
until
the
individual
was
sent
in
jail
for
90
days.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
well,
this
is
a
statutory
scheme.
there
could
be
up
to
15
statutes.
the
number
wouldn’t
make
any
difference
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
well,
they
are
representative
of
a
class
of
individuals
who
are
subjected
to
these
statutes.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
that’s
correct.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
you
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
as
i
said
earlier,
these
people’s
interests
would
be
satisfied
if
these
statutes
were
declared
unconstitutional
as
applied
or
on
their
face.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
i
believe
that
the
statutory
procedure
could
work
as
follows,
and
i
will
insert
when
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
i
believe
that
if
the
creditor
is
making
an
application
for
contempt
that
may
involve
incarceration
that
counsel
must
be
assigned.
when
the
individual
is
physically
brought
before
the
court
by
a
writ
of
attachment,
which
i
described
and
it
appears
that
the
individual
is
going
to
further
disobey
the
subpoena,
and
may
face
incarceration.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
that
individual
should
be
advised
of
his
right
to
obtain
counsel.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
no,
i
believe
that
what
needs
to
happen
is
this.
the
show
cause
order
must
be
issued
informing
the
person
that
they
may
be
arrested
if
they
don’t
appear.
if
the
person
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
right,
doesn’t
say
you
may
be
incarcerated.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
let’s
assume
so.[laughter]
the
individual
must
then
be
brought
before
the
court
by
writ
of
attachment,
physically
brought
into
court.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
he
must
be
assigned
counsel
when
he
is
physically
brought
before
the
court,
and
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
no,
i’m
sorry.
he
must
be
assigned
counsel
after
the
determination
has
been
made
that
he
is
indigent,
but
he
must
be
advised
of
his
right
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
it
can’t
be
done
and
i
don’t
suggest
that
it
needs
to
be.
i’m
suggesting
that
the
assignment
of
counsel
or
the
advising
of
an
individual
of
his
right
to
assign
counsel
must
occur
when
the
writ
of
attachment
--
after
the
writ
of
attachment
has
issued
and
the
individual
is
physically
before
the
judge.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
well,
unless
the
creditor
has
further
need
for
information
that
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
not
necessarily.
i’ve
enumerated
in
my
brief
a
listing
of
perhaps
10
defenses
that
can
be
raised
to
a
civil
contempt
action.
and
these
are
all
complicated
defenses
that
one
would
need
an
attorney
to
assert.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
that’s
correct.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
not
necessarily.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
not
necessarily.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
you
might
not
which
would
show
that
in
many
cases,
the
appointment
of
a
lawyer
is
not
going
to
be
needed,
but
it
will
also
ensure
that
the
individual
who
does
not
need
the
appointment
of
a
lawyer
is
advised
that
he
has
a
right
to
a
lawyer.
in
these
defenses,
particularly
in
the
support
and
alimony
area,
defenses
as
such
as
the
divorce
decree
was
a
foreign
decree.
the
divorce
decree
is
ambiguous.
these
are
the
kinds
of
things
that
maybe
raised
which
i
--
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
well,
these
are
--
there
was
a
support
and
alimony
individual
in
rabasco
and
he
might
have
been
able
to
assert
some
of
these
defenses
to
the
proceeding.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
sure.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
well,
i
read
the
order
differently.
i
read
the
order
in
light
of
the
opinion.
the
opinion
clearly
states
that
the
court
has
enjoined
further
application
of
these
statutes.
and
i
believe
that
very
clearly
means
that
it
does
not
have
retroactive
effect.
ms.
jane
e.
bloom
no,
it
is
not,
but
i
believe
that
it
can
only
logically
be
read
in
light
of
the
decision.
