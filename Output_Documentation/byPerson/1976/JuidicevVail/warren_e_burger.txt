chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
75-1397,
juidice
against
vail.
mr.
greenwald.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
a
witness
does
not
appear
in
response
to
a
subpoena
in
an
ordinary
lawsuit
under
the
new
york
code,
is
the
procedure
much
like
this
that
is
to
issue
an
order
to
show
cause
to
that
witness
why
he
should
not
be
punished
for
contempt?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
see
if
i
understand
this
sequence
correctly.
at
first
he
received
a
notice
in
the
form
a
subpoena
that
required
him
to
appear
for
the
usual
post-judgment
inquiry
of
a
judgment
debtor,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
did
not
respond
to
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
the
court,
when
he
did
not
appear,
the
court
issued
an
order
to
show
cause
directing
him
to
appear
to
show
cause,
why
he
should
not
be
punished
for
contempt,
that’s
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
failed
to
appear
to
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
when
he
did
not
appear
then,
then
the
court
issued
an
order
imposing
a
fine
and
that
was
the
third
stage.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
do
i
understand
correctly
that
the
fine
of
some
$270
so
called
fine,
was
then,
did
not
go
into
the
treasury
of
the
court
but
went
to
the
judgment
creditor
to
apply
on
the
debt,
is
that
correct
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
that
the
contempt
here
has
been
satisfied
by
the
payment
of
the
fine
which
has
been
applied
on
the
debt.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
you
regard
that
as
res
judicata?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
suppose
at
this
point,
the
judgment
creditor
served
a
notice
in
the
usual
way
for
an
additional
post
judgment
inquiry
into
assets
reciting
in
that
application
that
they
were
informed
and
believed
under
oath
that
the
judgment
debtor
had
inherited
real
estate
and
personal
property
in
the
value
of
at
least
$15,000.00.
at
the
present
time,
could
they
proceed
given
the
judgment
with
the
three-judge
court?
could
they
require
him
to
appear
and
submit
to
examination
and
if
he
failed,
could
a
state
court
judge
ultimately
find
him
in
contempt?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
about
these
statutes,
isn’t
the
statutory
pattern
similar
to
that
in
a
great
many
of
the
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
not
the
subpoena
itself
the
court
order?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
subpoena
that
was
issued
in
the
first
instance
here,
structurally
and
procedurally
the
same
kind
of
a
subpoena
that
is
issued
to
bring
witnesses
into
court
for
the
purposes
of
testifying
in
a
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
just
explains
a
different
purpose.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
procedurally,
you’re
telling
us
that
it
is
the
same
under
the
new
york
statutes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you’ve
covered
that
very
well
factually.
ms.
bloom?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
now
you
said
issued.
is
that
signed
by
clerk
of
the
court,
or
authorized
to
the
clerk
of
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
clerk
of
the
courts
as
you
see
it
for
due
process
purposes,
a
different
kind
of
an
officer
of
the
court
room,
a
lawyer
who
was
admitted
to
the
bar
under
new
york
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
hasn’t
the
new
york
statute
delegated
to
a
lawyer
who
is
attorney
of
record
in
a
particular
case,
the
authority
to
issue
that
subpoena?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
as
they
adjourned
the
hearing
or
the
appearance
to
another
place.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
new
york
law,
do
the
same
as
though
they
adjourned
it
from
the
third
floor
of
the
courthouse
to
the
fifth
floor.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
since
you
recite
that,
do
you
suggest
there
was
something
wrong
with
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
you’re
saying
that
the
additional
cost
cannot
be
allowed
to
the
judgment
creditor
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
and
he
is
contend
to
take
these
extra
steps?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
later,
though
there
was
this
time
span,
wasn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
anytime,
when
you
come
in
to
a
court
and
asked
for
the
appointment
of
a
lawyer
on
the
basis
of
his
indecency
in
order
to
protect
himself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
i’m
talking
about
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
to
stay
on
the
same
man.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
matter
how
many
times
he
refuses
to
show
up?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
--
but
if
he
at
some
point
showed
that
a
court
that
he
broke
his
leg
on
the
way,
you
don’t
suggest
that
any
court
would
hold
him
in
contempt
for
not
appearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
would
corrected
as
soon
as
it
was
shown
that
he
broke
his
leg
on
the
way
to
the
courthouse.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don’t
need
these
other
ten
defenses
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
ms.
bloom.
thank
you
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
75-1397,
juidice
against
vail
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
