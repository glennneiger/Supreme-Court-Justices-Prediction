justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
that
he
district
court
didn’t
merely
strike
it
down
in
its
application
as
to
these
particular
plaintiff
would
simply
say
the
state
of
new
york
couldn’t
enforce
it
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
state
file
an
answer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
a
judge
there
at
the
supplemental
proceedings?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
abstention
that
in
the
sense
that
younger
and
huffman,
and
not
in
the
sense
of
letting
the
state
court
decide
a
question
of
state
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
notices
of
deposition
in
the
federal
systems
that
are
issued
by
large,
and
if
you
don’t
show
up
for
a
deposition
certainly
court
proceedings
can
ensue
against
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it’s
a
violation
of
the
court
order
that
then
gives
rise
to
the
contempt,
rather
than
the
failure
to
show
in
the
first
instance.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
he
one
of
the
named
plaintiffs?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
a
contempt
order
at
that
point.
this
is
not
an
order
to
show
cause,
but
it
only
actually
is
holding
him
in
contempt?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
does
appeal
lie
from
the
county
court
of
the
appellant
here,
the
appellate
division?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
that
it’s
inconceivable
that
the
appellate
term
if
your
client
had
appealed
that
citation,
would
not
have
found
some
violation
of
state
law
in
citing
under
those
circumstances?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
doesn’t
the
appellate
term
have
authority
to
grant
a
stay
if
it
held
that
the
man
was
being
incarcerated
by
the
county
court
wrongly?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
jurisdictional
statement.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
you
ever
heard
of
a
law
that’s
been
struck
down
by
this
court
on
its
face
outside
of
the
first
amendment
area?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
then
it’s
on
as
applied
basis
in
the
case
of
these
particular
plaintiffs
even
if
your
right
on
the
merits,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
was
there
anything
wrong
or
were
there
have
been
any
short
comings
in
any
possible
state
remedies
or
adjudications
with
respect
to
your
constitutional
issues?
in
short,
could
you
have
raised
them
in
the
state
court
and
have
them
adjudicated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don’t
you
think
the
state
has
just
as
great
an
interest
in
seeing
the
authority
that’s
courts
vindicated
as
it
does
in
pursuing
a
quasi-criminal
remedy
on
an
obscenity
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
appellees
in
this
case
are
new
york
judgment
debtors.
when
they
failed
to
pay
the
judgments,
their
creditors
subpoenaed
them
to
appear
for
supplemental
proceedings.
the
notices
informed
the
debtors
that
failure
to
comply
was
punishable
by
contempt
of
court.
when
the
appellees
did
not
comply
with
these
notices,
the
appellants
who
are
state
judges
in
new
york,
issued
orders
requiring
them
to
appear
in
court
to
show
cause
why
they
should
not
be
held
in
contempt.
appellees
again
failed
to
comply.
appellees
were
then
held
in
contempt
in
order
to
pay
fines.
when
they
failed
to
pay
the
fines,
the
appellant
judges
issued
ex
parte
commitment
orders
and
the
debtors
were
jailed.
at
this
point,
the
debtors
brought
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
seeking
to
enjoin
the
statutory
contempt
procedures
used
by
new
york
on
the
grounds
that
the
procedures
used
leading
to
imprisonment
for
contempt
of
court
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
three-judge
district
court,
after
deciding
that
it
should
not
abstain,
declared
the
challenge
sections
of
the
new
york
judiciary
law
to
be
unconstitutional
and
enjoined
their
enforcement.
for
the
reasons
given
and
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
we
hold
that
because
of
the
availability
of
the
pending
stay
judicial
proceedings
in
which
the
constitutional
issues
could
have
been
raised,
it
was
error
for
the
federal
court
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
these
state
statutes.
we
conclude
that
the
principles
of
comity
and
federalism
discussed
in
our
decisions
in
younger
against
harris,
and
huffman
versus
pursue,
are
applicable
to
constitutional
challenges
to
state
contempt
procedures.
the
state's
interest
in
the
contempt
process
through
which
it
vindicates
the
regular
operation
of
its
judicial
system
has
an
important
interest.
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
deciding
that
younger
and
huffman
were
not
applicable
when
these
procedures
were
challenged
and
its
judgment
is
accordingly
reversed.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
and
the
result.
mr.
justice
brennan
joined
by
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
