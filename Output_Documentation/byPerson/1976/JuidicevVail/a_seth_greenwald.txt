mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
or
order
of
a
three-judge
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
which
declared
unconstitutional,
seven
sections
of
new
york’s
judiciary
law.
they
were
declared
unconstitutional
as
on
the
basis
that
they
were
unconstitutional
on
their
face.
in
other
words
that
basically
that
every
word
in
them
was
unconstitutional,
and
the
basis
of
this
declaration
was
that
they
were
in
violation
of
the
due
process
rights
of
the
appellees
--
plaintiffs
below.
the
statute,
or
sections
of
the
statute
in
question
form
part
of
article
19
of
this
law,
which
provide
a
process
and
framework
for
punishing
contempts
of
court.
in
this
case,
those
that
are
denominated
or
processed
for
punishing
civil
contempts.
however,
it
should
be
i
think
pointed
out
that
this
process
applies
to
all
disobedience
or
disregard
of
court
orders,
and
while
this
case
is
said
to
come
up
in
the
context
of
disregard
of
a
subpoena
or
in
supplementary
proceedings
to
disclose
assets
after
a
judgment
is
obtained.
it
would
also
apply
the
order
of
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
to
people
who
violate
injunctions
in
the
state
court,
support
orders
where
husbands
or
wives
are
to
support
their
spouses
and
the
like.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
say
yes
that
and
that
was
the
effect
that
the
state
of
new
york
could
not
enforce
or
punish
contempts
of
court.
and
i
say
that
because
it
declared
the
seven
sections
of
the
law
unconstitutional
on
their
face,
and
it
also
declared
this
to
be
a
class
action
and
the
plaintiffs
were
all
people
who’d
ever
been
subject
to
civil
contempt
in
the
state
of
new
york.
and
i
think
it’s
rather
clear
from
the
order
that
it
applied
to
people
who
have
been
and
who
are
currently
subject
to
be.
so
it
had
a
all
pervasive
effect
and
as
i
say,
it
basically
and
totally
enjoined
this
process,
which
is
fundamental
to
the
operation
of
any
court,
state
or
federal.
now,
as
to
what
are
called
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
district
court
resided
what
it
called
the
typical
case
of
harry
vail.
i
wish
to
emphasis
that
this
was
based
on
simply
allegations
in
a
complaint,
because
there
was
no
trial
here,
indeed,
if
you
look
at
the
record
there’s
not
even
an
affidavit
from
harry
vail
as
to
the
facts
of
his
case.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
the
state
in
this
case
or
the
appellant’s
state
court
judges,
were
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
before
the
three-judge
court,
moving
to
dismiss.
in
effect
they
never
got
a
chance
to
file
an
answer,
and
i
would
submit
that
when
the
plaintiffs
are
simply
moving
for
a
preliminary
injunction,
obviously
according
to
the
federal
rules,
there’s
no
requirement
that
we
file
an
answer.
and
after
the
grant
of
what
was
called
at
first
by
the
way,
it
was
a
final
order,
and
then
the
district
court
revised
it
for
partial
summary
judgment,
but
basically
of
course,
the
partial
summary
judgment
was
an
injunction
and
in
effect
the
grant
of
final
reliefs,
and
certainly
it
was
final
insofar
as
to
the
appellant’s
in
state
court
judges.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
but
i
wish
to
emphasises
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
think
the
district
court
realized,
because
we
had
a
hearing
after
the
first
order
came
down,
after
the
decision
came
down,
which
was
in
the
form
of
an
order.
and
i
pointed
out
to
the
district
court
that
their
order
was
so
all
pervasive
and
all
encompassing
that
it
would
wreak
havoc
with
the
process
of
state
courts
adjudicating
civil
contempt
in
the
state
of
new
york.
and
i
can
confidently
say
that
that
was
the
situation.
judges
and
lawyers
in
the
state
were
in
such
a
state
of
confusion
that
nothing
could
be
done.
now,
in
answer
to
your
question,
i
think
the
point
was
that
the
district
court
may
have
thought
it
was
perhaps
cutting
back
or
being
more
a
little
judicious
in
its
order,
but
the
practical
effect
was
still
that
there
was
no
way
in
the
state
of
new
york
to
issue
--
even
issue
process
in
order
to
show
cause.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
and
when
you
excise
seven
sections
of
judiciary
law,
which
provide
for
the
issuance
of
process,
which
provide
for
the
hearing,
which
provide
for
the
punishment,
you
are
left
with
nothing.
and
as
it
was
pointed
out
i
think,
by
the
sheriff
of
the
city
of
new
york,
unless
there’s
a
statute
you
cannot
ultimately
punish
someone
for
contempt
by
commitment
in
the
state
of
new
york,
unless
there
is
some
statute
in
existence.
now,
getting
back
to
the
case
of
harry
vail,
i
also
wish
to
emphasize,
and
this
involves
all
the
appellees
that
this
involves
one
county
of
the
state
of
new
york,
what
seems
to
be
the
practice
or
procedure
in
dutchess
county.
i
think
my
briefs
and
the
cases
i
cite
show
that
it
is
not
uniformly
or
the
rule
throughout
the
state
of
new
york
as
to
how
courts
proceed
in
the
adjudications
of
civil
contempt’s,
and
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
would
say
that
it
is
basically
the
same
that
you
see,
disobedience
of
the
subpoena
is
punishable
as
a
contempt
of
court
and
indeed
the
subpoena
here
and
pretty
much
any
subpoena
that’s
issued
states
on
its
face
that
disregard
of
the
subpoena
is
punishable
as
a
contempt
of
court.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
right.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
i
mean
that
is
ultimate
remedy
of
the
court
to
enforce
the
subpoena.
there
has
to
be
some
method
of
enforcement.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
there
has
been
some
discussion
as
to
the
inherent
power
of
a
court
to
punish
a
civil
content.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
but
i
submit
that
in
the
context
of
new
york’s
procedure
and
judiciary
law
which
sets
forth
a
process
for
the
punishment
or
citing
someone
for
civil
contempt
and
then
a
hearing
and
then
an
adjudication
of
contempt
that
fully
satisfies
due
process.
now,
mr.
vail
and
the
other
appellees
complain
of
being
found
in
civil
contempt
and
that
after
being
found
in
civil
contempt
they
were
fined
for
that
civil
contempt,
and
after
they
failed
to
pay
that
fine
they
were
--
or
he
was,
not
all
of
the
appellees
were,
committed
for
nonpayment
of
that
fine.
actually
i
would
point
out
that
in
mr.
vail’s
case
it
happened
to
be
one
day
and
in
fact
all
the
appellees
who
say
they
were
committed
was
a
very
short
period.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
as
to
his
assets.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
he
did
not
respond
to
that.
that
is
–
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
that
is
right.
on
the
application
or
affidavit
or
affirmation
of
the
judgment
creditor’s
attorney,
he
requested.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
that
was
the
third
stage.
and
this
by
the
way
all
these
were
of
course
personally
served
on
the
judgment
debtor,
as
far
as
the
facts
of
this
case,
there’s
no
dispute
about
that.
although,
you’ll
see
an
affidavit
someone
claiming,
he
got
a
subpoena
in
the
mail.
if
the
be
the
case,
then
that
is
a
complete
defense
to
the
action
or
the
proceeding.
but
certainly
as
to
the
class,
all
of
this
is
personally
served,
and
as
i
say
that
these
are
court
records.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
that
is
correct.
the
fine
--
since
this
is
denominated
a
civil
contempt
goes
to
the
party
instituting
the
proceeding
and
in
all
of
these
cases
goes
to
the
reduction
of
the
judgment
and
i
think
in
mr.
vail’s
case,
the
fining
order
required
him
to
pay
$10
a
week.
so
therefore,
it
wasn’t
something
that
had
to
be
paid
all
at
once.
now,
i
think
the
context
of
one
default
after
another,
has
to
be
recognized.
when
we
speak
about
due
process,
as
to
this
contempt
proceeding,
there
is
no
dispute
that
every
one
of
these
appellees
got
notice
and
furthermore,
received
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
and,
if
at
any
point
the
contemnor,
that’s
the
judgment
debtor,
had
responded
and
informed
the
judgment
creditor
in
proper
manner,
or
the
court
of
their
indigency
because
these
appellees
claim
they’re
indigent,
and
evidenced
his
lack
of
assets.
since
the
matter
would
be
ended,
because
that
was
the
object
of
the
subpoena,
to
examine
as
to
assets.
so
once
again,
i
would
state
that
to
mr.
vail
and
every
other
appellee
here,
due
process
was
accorded.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
that’s
the
end
of
it.
he’s
responded
to
the
subpoena
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
no,
the
judgment
is
not
vacated,
but
the
point
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
subpoena
was
to
examine
this
judgment
debtor
to
see
whether
he
had
any
assets
available
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
judgment.
that
was
the
only
purpose
of
the
subpoena.
to
vacate
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
absolutely
not,
because
the
point
is
that
the
judgment
debtor
has
responded
to
the
subpoena.
he’s
not
in
default.
the
only
way
to
vacate
the
judgment
would
be
of
course
either
to
make
a
motion
to
vacate
the
judgment,
or
declare
bankruptcy
which
then
can
wipe
out
the
judgment,
but
that’s
another
process.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
the
supplementary
proceedings
are
done
on
a
subpoena
issued
by
the
attorney,
and
normally
a
judge
is
not
there.
they
can,
there’s
some
process
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
at
the
court
room,
or
i
think
they
often
times
it
returned
to
the
lawyer's
office.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
like
a
deposition,
right.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
limit,
but
i
would
submit
of
course
if
this
comes
down
to
being
harassment
that
obviously
relief
from
the
court
can
be
obtained.
indeed
i
cite
the
case
where
in
my
reply
brief,
case
for
(inaudible)
bank
where
the
state
court
simply
enjoined
any
further
supplementary
proceedings
after
being
informed
in
an
informal
manner,
just
a
letter
of
the
fact
that
the
judgment
debtor
was
on
public
assistance.
i
also
wish
to
emphasis
in
having
stated
what
is
called
the
facts
that
if
this
type
of
matter,
this
type
of
adjudication
of
civil
contempt
is
to
be
reviewed,
i
submit
that
this
court
should
do
it
on
what
is
a
full
record.
namely,
where
it
has
come
up
through
the
state
courts
where
the
matter
has
been
fully
litigated
and
the
facts
found.
and
this
is
why
i
contend
that
the
district
court
should
have
abstained.
in
other
words,
it
should
have
considered
the
applicable
principles
of
federalism,
comity
and
equity
which
apply
to
any
federal
court
when
i
see
it
in
effect
reviewing
state
court
decisions.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
am
not
speaking
in
the
sense
of
the
younger
huffman
abstention.
however,
i
will
say
that
i
think
it’s
not
completely
clear,
or
i
think
that
the
abstention
to
obtain
a
ruling
of
the
state
court
as
to
procedures
might
be
efficacious
in
this
case
too
because
you
are
dealing
here
with
a
statute
that
basically
has
not
been
construed
by
the
state
court
in
a
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
if
we
speak
about
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
in
the
case
of
mr.
vail,
apparently
the
whole
thing
was
over.
it
was
almost
like
and
that
gets
to
res
judicata.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
he
had
been
found
in
contempt.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
he
had
been
fined.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
commitment
order
had
been
issued,
and
he
had
paid
the
fine.
so
the
whole
matter
is
over.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
i
mean
certainly
mr.
vail’s
case
would
not
warrant
an
injunction,
i
think
i
could
say.
however,
if
there
was
any
complaint
about
that,
then
if
it’s
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
couldn’t
think
it
really
did
affect
his
case.
however,
i
can’t
rely
on
the
fact
that
mr.
vail
not
having
a
case
for
an
injunction
because
there
were
other
appellees,
in
fact
i
think
there
were
8
or
9
in
number
and
they
came
into
federal
court
after
they’d
been
adjudicating
contempt
and
have
been
served
with
defining
order.
and
requested
a
temporary
restraining
order
from
the
federal
court
and
obtained
same.
and
i
wish
to
emphasis
by
the
way
that
i
did
not
oppose
any
restraint
--
i
mean,
oppose
these
restraining
orders,
but
i
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
certainly
did.
and
i
think
it’s
rather
obvious
because
there’s
some
discussion
of
it
in
the
district
court
opinion.
i
also
--
though
as
to
the
people
who
had
been
already
found
in
contempt,
i
had
put
in
a
motion
to
dismiss,
and
that’s
all
we
had
in
the
district
court.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
because
if
we
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
it
might
very
well
mean
that.
you
see,
reading
from
20
(a)
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
this
is
the
order
appealed
from.
the
seven
sections
are
unconstitutional
on
their
face
and
permanently
enjoining
the
operations,
sets
statutes
against
plaintiffs
and
members
of
that
class
namely
all
persons
who
have
been
or
--
are
presently
subject
to
civil
contempt
proceedings.
now,
if
you
say
have
been,
i
think
that
has
a
common
--
the
common
meaning
to
mean,
anybody
from
the
year
one
who’s
ever
been
held
in
civil
contempt.
he
can
be
removed
from
that
status.
in
other
words,
fines
would
have
to
be
repaid.
you
have
possibly
of
all
types
of
legal
action
which
would
be
quite
disruptive
of
the
whole
contempt
process.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
that’s
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
the
case
of
harry
vail.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
would
put
it
this
way.
they
still
can
of
course
serve
a
subpoena
and
supplementary
proceedings.
the
cafa
lawyer
would
be
well
advised
to
put
on
that
subpoener
as
the
form
company.
the
company
that
publishes
this
type
of
form
in
new
york.
it’s
generally
a
form
what
we
call
bloomberg
forms,
would
have
on
it
failure
to
reply
to
the
subpoena
not
only
would
subject
in
punishment
for
contempt,
but
may
result
in
your
fine
or
imprisonment.
but
at
this
point
after
this,
after
the
disregard
of
the
subpoena,
if
the
attorney
would
seek
to
obtain
the
order
to
show
cause
to
punish
for
contempt
under
section
757,
the
procedure
provided
for,
he
could
not
do
so,
because
under
the
judgment
of
the
court
below,
it
doesn’t
exist
anymore.
it’s
been
declared
unconstitutional.
it’s
been
enjoined.
it
can’t
be
used.
and,
yes
sir?
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
very
curious.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
it
might
very
well
be
possible
for
the
payment,
but
i
wish
to
point
out
and
in
my
reply
brief
i
cite
the
case
of
brown
against
liberty
loan
corporation
where
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
a
lower
district
court
and
held
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
give
notice
to
the
fact
that
you
have
exemptions.
that
due
process
does
not
require
that.
basically,
due
process
doesn’t
require
or
doesn’t
legislate
this
type
of
notice
and
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
do
not
know
of
any
procedure.
the
point
i
would
make
is
that
if
a
person
has
exempt
property
and
chooses
to
satisfy
his
just
debts
and
let
us
recognize
the
fact
that
there’s
a
judgment
involved.
that
should
not
be
condemned.
he
has
an
exemption.
he
can
rely
on
that
exemption.
but
if
he
has
available
money
and
chooses
to
pay
this
debt
which
has
been
reduced
to
judgment,
i
don’t
see
where
any
constitutional
objection
can
be
made.
now
as
i
wish
to
emphasis,
the
federal
court
here
essentially
took
a
state
court
record
and
then
proceeded
to
review
it
as
if
it
was
a
state
appellate
court.
and
i
submit
that
it
does
not
have
that
power
and
under
the
principles
of
huffman
against
pursue
that
abstention
is
entirely
proper
in
this
case.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
the
judiciary
law
was
passed
about
the
turn
of
the
century.
i
think
it
was
enacted
about
1906
or
1907.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
say
they
have
not
been
construed
in
light
of
these
constitutional
objections
and
that
is
the
type
of
abstention.
the
other
type
of
abstention
where
england
against
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
--
medical
examinees.
that
type
of
construction,
and
i
also
point
out
that
as
to
the
supplementary
proceedings
or
the
subpoena.
this
type
of
subpoena
i
believe,
the
contempt
process
only
became
applicable
in
1963
as
result
of
civil
practice
law
and
rules
which
in
a
section
said
that
disregard
of
that
the
subpoener
is
punishable
as
contempt
of
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes
certainly.
yes
they
are
used
everyday.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
it
certainly
is
and
in
our
jurisdictional
statement
i
cite
a
number
of
state
statutes
and
i
do
not
see
anything
basically
different
between
their
statutes
and
our
statutes.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
no,
we
do
not
have
civil
--
we
do
not
have
a
specific
civil
jail
in
new
york
city
anymore.
and
in
fact
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
put
them
in
rikers
island.
in
point
the
fact
though,
it’s
very
difficult
if
the
person
takes
his
opportunity
to
be
heard,
to
be
fined
or
be
found
in
civil
contempt
if
you’re
truly
indigent.
and
this
brings
me
up
to
i
think
i
should
say,
because
i
see
my
time
is
getting
very
short.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
the
statutory
authority
is
in
the
civil
practice
law
and
rules,
i
think
in
the
5000
or
5200.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
no,
that’s
not
an
issue.
the
appellees
are
not
contending
that
they
cannot
be
required
to
disclose
their
assets.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
no,
the
attorney
issues
the
subpoena
as
an
officer
of
the
court
as
he
does
in
many
states.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
he
has
the
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
think
--
i
would
be
speaking
from
some
vague
recollection
frankly
that
i’ve
seen
something
like
a
2
year
limit
on
this.
i
couldn’t
cite
the
statute,
but
there
is
a
time
limit
basically.
you
can’t
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
that
is
correct.
i
wish
to
emphasis.
the
contempt
of
court
is
not
the
failure
to
pay
the
judgment.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
the
subpoena
is
deemed
to
be
a
court
order,
because
the
attorney
in
this
case
is
acting
as
an
officer
of
the
court
as
he
does
in
many
states.
i
think
in
some
states,
he
can
issue
say
a
number
of
types
of
process
as
an
officer
of
the
court,
but
to
what
i
wish
to
emphasis
is
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
of
course.
right
in
the
federal
system
like
i
think
a
marshall
has
to
serve
the
summons
in
complaint.
in
state
court
anybody
can.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
that’s
right.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
but
the
point
is
that
due
process,
and
this
is
what
i
wish
to
emphasize.
due
process
requires
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
the
order
to
show
cause
here,
as
it’s
recognized
in
the
district
court
opinion
gives
that
notice,
and
then
gives
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
court.
basically,
the
enforcement
of
this
subpoener
is
a
totally
judicial
process
and
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
signed
by
a
judge.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
or
be
punished
for
contempt.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
and
i
think
those
words
have
a
common
meaning.
now,
as
to
the
specific
objections
if
abstention
is
not
applied
to
this
case
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
with
the
order?
then
of
course,
and
this
isn't
very,
i
shouldn’t
say
of
course.
the
judge
would
question
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
he
could
hold
him
in
contempt
and
of
course
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
he
could
and
of
course
that
holding
of
contempt
could
be
reviewed
on
appeal.
i’m
not
here
saying
that
my
clients,
the
state
court
judges
made
the
correct
decision
because
the
correctness
of
their
decision
is
to
be
reviewed
on
appeal
if
the
person
who
is
held
in
contempt
objects
to
it.
but
what
i
wish
to
emphasize
is
basics
of
this
case
is
the
claim
of
indigency
the
appellees
claim
they’re
indigent.
and
if
any
judgment
debtor
comes
in
to
court
in
response
to
this
order
to
show
cause
and
says
“i
have
no
money,
i
am
indigent.”
then
of
course,
then
the
judge
would
examine
him
a
little
further
about
that
indigency.
as
a
matter
of
law,
he
would
not
be
found
in
contempt
and
indeed
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
but,
i
do
wish
to
emphasize
that
the
cases
--
the
few
cases
and
their
(inaudible)
in
the
state
of
new
york
indicate
that
if
at
the
show
cause
hearing,
the
judgment
debtor
shows
that
he
is
indigent,
that
he
cannot
you
know
--
that
in
effect
that
he
can
not
pay
the
judgment,
that’s
the
end
of
the
matter.
he’s
not
held
in
contempt.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
it’s
conceivable,
but
what
i
wish
to
emphasize
is
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
but
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
since
the
ultimate
penalty
here
is
a
fine,
and
if
the
person
cannot
pay
the
fine,
he
can
not
be
committed.
then
that’s
the
end
of
the
subpoena
and
that
is
basically
what
happened
in
the
new
york
courts.
the
problem
in
this
case
is
not
the
lack
of
any
due
process,
it’s
the
complete
disregard
of
judicial
process
by
the
appellees
and
if
there
was
any
error
in
the
action
of
the
appellants
--
the
state
court
judges,
that
is
to
be
reviewed
on
appeal
by
the
state
courts
with
an
appeal
to
this
court
if
the
condemner
so
chose.
the
point
is
you
have
no
record
here,
and
these
statutes
do
provide
due
process.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
basically
it
is.
it
tells
the
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
it
tells
the
person
to
come
to
a
place
to
be
examined
in
accordance
with
law.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
basically
and
if
you
disregard
that
subpoena
you
have
contempt
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
believe
they
do
have
a
procedure
for
making
them
returnable
in
their
office.
i
don’t
think
that’s
--
as
i
say,
that’s
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
state
court
procedures
and
decisions,
and
that’s
where
i
think
abstention
should
apply.
and
i
see,
if
i
could
take
another
minute
that
i
say
that
the
requirement
of
an
actual
hearing.
well
there
was
a
hearing
here.
it’s
just
the
problem
was
the
appellees
didn’t
come.
as
to
the
actual
presence,
i
think
this
court
has
decided
in
blackmer
against
united
states
that
this
type
of
actual
presence
is
not
required
as
long
as
person
has
received
notice
and
the
same
type
of
notice
was
involved
in
blackmer
and
he
had
the
opportunity
to
appear
as
he
did
here.
