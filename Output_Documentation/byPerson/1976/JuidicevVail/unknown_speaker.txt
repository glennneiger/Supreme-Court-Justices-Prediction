unknown
speaker
and
through
the
subpoena.
unknown
speaker
requiring
any
witness
to
show
up
anywhere,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
what
subpoena
means
as
a
matter
of
language.
it
means
show
up
under
penalty
of
--
that’ll
happen
to
you
if
you
don’t
show
up?
unknown
speaker
mr.
greenwald,
let
me
just
clarify
this
one
thing
in
my
mind.
had
the
--
vail
to
take
the
example,
responded
to
the
discovery
proceeding
and
come
in
and
testify
that
he
had
no
assets,
under
new
york
practice,
what
would
have
happened
then?
unknown
speaker
did
they
vacate
the
judgment
then,
the
default
judgment?
unknown
speaker
if
the
examination
discloses
the
kind
of
a
border
line
case
say,
does
the
judge
have
the
power
at
that
proceeding
to
enter
some
kind
of
a
payment
order
other
than
the
initial
judgment?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
there,
where
is
there,
in
the
court
room?
unknown
speaker
like
a
deposition.
unknown
speaker
and
how
often
can
the
judgment
creditor
do
this.
let’s
say
the
first
time
he
comes
in
and
the
judgment
debtor
says
“sorry,
i
have
no
money
and
i
have
a
lot
of
debts
and
no
assets.”
then,
can
the
judgment
creditor
trial
over
again
the
following
week?
is
there
any
limit
on
how
many
times
or
how
frequently
he
can
do
it,
otherwise?
unknown
speaker
well,
at
that
time,
what
was
the
precise
status
of
this
state
proceeding
when
the
injunction
was
entered?
unknown
speaker
there
had
been
a
holding
of
contempt?
there
had
been
an
adjudication
of
contempt?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
it
was
over?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
he
faced
no
confinement?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
injunction
probably
didn’t
affect
his
case
in
any
way.
unknown
speaker
did
you
ask
for
abstention
in
the
lower
court?
unknown
speaker
what
did
the
district
court
mean
by
when
he
said
that
he
was
going
to
make
his
unconstitutionality
judgment
retroactive?
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean
that
somebody
could
get
his
fine
back?
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you
a
question
mr.
greenwald?
as
here,
so
often
when
a
man
goes
to
jail,
all
of
a
sudden
a
fine
is
paid.
and
--
unknown
speaker
well,
it’s
possible
is
it
not
for
the
payment
to
be
made
out
of
the
exempt
property?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
i
wanted
to
ask,
do
you
have
any
procedure
in
new
york
whereby
a
return
of
payment
made
out
of
the
exempt
property
can
be
effectuated?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
this
in
that
connection
general
greenwald.
how
long
these
laws
have
been
on
the
books
in
new
york
state?
unknown
speaker
are
you
certain
that
they’ve
never
been
construed
by
the
new
york
courts?
i
have
difficulty
following
that.
unknown
speaker
medical
examinees.
unknown
speaker
but
that’s
13
years,
and
certainly
these
are
not
dead
letter
laws,
they
are
used
everyday
aren’t
they
by
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
greenwald,
i
shouldn't
use
your
time
this
way
but
could
you
help
me?
what
is
the
statutory
authorization
for
the
initial
discovery
notice
served
by
the
lawyer
in
the
post
judgment
procedure?
unknown
speaker
but
that
has
not
been
held
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
understand.
just
to
get
my
problem
off
before
you.
the
attorney’s
notice
then
is
not
preceded
by
any
court
proceeding
of
any
kind
other
than
the
default
judgment,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
he
has
authority
as
a
lawyer
to
pick
the
time
and
place
and
all
the
rest
of
it
on
his
own?
unknown
speaker
and
for
what
period
of
time
after
the
entry
of
the
default
judgment
may
he
do
this,
until
the
judge
is
satisfied?
unknown
speaker
now,
the
rule
to
show
cause
why
the
debtor
shall
not
be
held
in
contempt
to
court.
if
the
contempt
of
court
is
the
failure
to
honor
the
lawyer’s
subpoena,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but,
do
you
know
of
any
other
state
procedures
which
provide
contempt
of
court
for
the
failure
to
respond
to
a
notice
of
the
kind
which
is
not
preceded
by
any
court
order?
unknown
speaker
that’s
the
different
from
the
federal
system
for
example.
unknown
speaker
or,
but
at
least
he
not
only
gets
a
subpoena
but
then
if
he
fails
to
live
up
and
to
show
up
he
then
gets
that
order
against
him.
unknown
speaker
which
is,
if
he
either
come
in
and
explain
it
or
you’re
going
to
be
fined.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
he
shows
up
in
compliance
with
that
order?
unknown
speaker
could
the
judge
under
the
statute
hold
him
in
contempt
no
matter
what
he
say?
unknown
speaker
if
he
didn’t
give
him
a
good
excuse,
could
he
hold
him
in
contempt?
unknown
speaker
if
you
are
not
complying
with
the
original
subpoena.
unknown
speaker
but
why
not
if
he
didn’t
show
up
to
the
lawyers’
subpoena?
indigence
is
no
defense
to
failure
to
respond
to
process,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
is
it
even
if
the
lawyer
had
tried
on
35
occasions
to
get
him
to
respond
to
him
subpoenaed
at
his
office,
and
he
just
refused
to
come
in
and
say
“i’m
not
going
to
any
lawyers
office
at
all,
and
you
can’t
make
me.”
couldn’t
the
judge
hold
him
in
contempt
for
that
even
if
he
was
indigent?
unknown
speaker
but
then
--
and
then
he
is
not
a
complete
defense.
unknown
speaker
well
don’t
some
of
your
new
york
grand
jury
subpoenas
require
appearance
in
the
office
of
an
assistant
district
attorney
rather
than
court?
unknown
speaker
now,
the
subpoena
or
the
show
cause
order?
unknown
speaker
the
original
subpoena?
unknown
speaker
of
course
he
didn’t
obey
it
in
the
sense
that
if
he
went
to
the
place
of
the
deposition,
he
refused
to
testify.
unknown
speaker
the
original
subpoena?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
had
obeyed
that.
he
showed
up
at
the
court
house,
didn’t
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
that’s
what
the
subpoena
required
him
to
do.
unknown
speaker
you
never
finished
telling
us
the
sad
story
of
mr.
ward,
because
we
interrupted
you.
i’d
be
interested
in
the
data
more--
unknown
speaker
now,
was
that
authorized
by
the
statute
or
was
that
clerical
error?
unknown
speaker
but
that’s
credited
against
the
debt,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
you
haven’t
quite
finished
mr.
ward’s
story
yet.
unknown
speaker
have
you
finished
with
the
ward
story?
unknown
speaker
what
happened
to
him
then,
ultimately?
unknown
speaker
ms.
bloom,
in
your
recital
of
mr.
ward’s
tribulations,
you
mentioned
the
fact
that
he
was
subject
to
a
support
order.
what
is
the
procedure
in
new
york
if
he
had
ignored
that
in
the
same
way
that
he
ignored
the
other
order?
unknown
speaker
how
is
that
accomplished?
unknown
speaker
that
same
procedure
followed
in
the
divorce
case
where
alimony
is
ordered?
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
divorce
was
in
an
ordinary
court
not
the
family
court,
what
are
the
procedures
with
respect
to
alimony?
unknown
speaker
the
judgment
in
this
case
would
invalidate
that
procedure
as
well
as
with
respect
that
it
was.
unknown
speaker
well,
these
plaintiffs
are
whole
class
of
people
by
the
law,
aren’t
they?
unknown
speaker
so,
if
you
strike
it
down
as
applied
to
these
plaintiffs,
you’re
striking
down
the
whole
law
as
applied
to
anybody
to
whom
it
applies
--
unknown
speaker
even
in
the
area
of
criminal
law
for
person.
if
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
voluntarily
absents
himself
at
a
trial
he
can
still
be
convicted
and
sentenced
to
prison
--
unknown
speaker
--
misdemeanor
case.
unknown
speaker
now
you’re
shifting
the
ground.
up
to
now
it
was
of
he
didn’t
get
a
hearing,
but
he
was
given
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing.
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
that
his
--
that
he
didn’t
get
a
hearing,
and
the
same
thing
in
a
criminal
trial.
if
you
voluntarily
absent
yourself
after
the
trial
begins
you
can
still
be
convicted.
you
have
the
opportunity
to
be
there,
but
that’s
all
the
state
need
accord
you.
even
in
the
context
of
a
criminal
conviction.
unknown
speaker
at
some
point
in
that
process,
he
could’ve
got
a
hold
of
a
lawyer
earlier.
he
could’ve
raised
all
the
questions
he
wanted
to
in
the
state
court.
unknown
speaker
or
if
he
had
known
nothing
or
he
had
known
enough
himself.
now,
you
seem
to
treat
these
proceedings
a
lot
like
a
criminal
case
in
terms
of
what
procedures
might
be
required,
presence
and
counsel
and
things
like
that.
and
yet
you
say
it
shouldn’t
be
treated
as
a
criminal
case
or
even
quasi
criminal
case
for
the
purposes
of
younger
abstention.
unknown
speaker
but
when
you’re
talking
about
vindicating
the
authority
of
a
state
court
and
you’re
pretty
close
to
the
core
of
the
state
interest
in
this
judicial
process
statute.
it’s
not
just
enjoining
some
case.
this
is
keeping
a
court
from
protecting
its
own
authority.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
you’d
say
that
i
don’t
blame
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
huffman,
his
pursue
wasn’t
it
strictly
a
criminal
case,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
they
-
the
defendant
cannot
be
held
in
contempt
until
they
further
disregard,
a
show
cause
order.
it
maybe
we
held
in
contempt
even
if
he
comes
to
court
in
response
to
that
show
cause
order,
but
he
cannot
be
held
in
contempt
without
disobeying
that
order.
i
mean,
at
least
he
cannot
be
held
in
contempt
without
that
order
having
issued
by
the
judge.
unknown
speaker
ms.
bloom,
would
you
tell
me,
you
have
covered
so
much
now.
what
do
you
think
is
the
most
objectionable
feature
in
this
statutory
scheme
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
assuming
that
these
people
actually
were
in
contempt
of
--properly
found
in
contempt
pursuant
to
the
statute.
is
it
the
possibility
of
90
day
sentence?
unknown
speaker
at
what
point
would
you
say
the
assignment
of
counsel
should
take
place,
before
the
arrest
or
after
they’re
brought
into
jail?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
shouldn’t
have
said
what
do
you
think.
what
do
you
think
the
constitution
commands
in
this
regard?
unknown
speaker
is
this
critical
in
this
development
that
the
court
know
that
the
man
is
indigent
or
not?
supposing
he
is
a
harvard
graduate
and
a
millionaire,
would
we
make
the
same
argument?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
advise
him
if
he
doesn’t
show
up?
is
this
the
defect
in
the
form
of
a
notice?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
show
cause
says
he
may
be
punished.
unknown
speaker
but
as
a
harvard
graduate
would
probably
figure
that
out.
unknown
speaker
he
maybe
taken
into
custody
before
counsel
is
appointed
then.
unknown
speaker
even
though
you
don’t
know
whether
he’s
indigent
or
not?
unknown
speaker
and
how
can
you
make
that
determination
till
you
get
him
before
the
court?
unknown
speaker
and
he
says
“i’m
indigent.”
now,
he
doesn’t
really
need
a
lawyer,
because
the
judge
is
going
to
turn
him
free.
unknown
speaker
seems
to
me
that
the
need
for
counsel
vanishes
at
the
same
time
that
it
arises.
unknown
speaker
but
ms.
bloom,
the
only
way
you
get
a
lawyer
appointed
for
you
is
because
you’re
indigent.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you’re
indigent,
you
have
a
complete
defense.
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
need
any
of
these
other
defenses.
unknown
speaker
and
by
indigency
do
you
become
eligible
for
the
appointment
of
a
lawyer.
unknown
speaker
ms.
bloom,
i’m
afraid
we
haven’t
given
you
much
of
an
opportunity
to
make
your
own
arguments,
but
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
unknown
speaker
i’m
interested
in
the
effect
of
the
order.
assume
for
the
moment
that
we
affirm
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
the
order
applies
to
all
persons
that
in
the
limitation
as
to
time
who
have
been
subjected
to
this
procedure
in
the
past
to
go
back
to
1906,
i
suppose
if
anybody
is
still
alive.
what
remedy
would
they
have
in
a
practical
matter?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
what
the
orders
says,
isn't
it?
