justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
did
on
page
20,
it
seems
they
did
try
to
limit
it.
they
granted
a
declaratory
judgment
which
said,
“it
was
only
enjoined
against
being
used
against
the
members
who
declared.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
i
interpreted
that
they
were
trying
to
cut
back
a
little?
not
that
they
were
successful.[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
they
held
it
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
their
face.
i
guess,
you
mean
on
their
faces.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn’t
that
without
--
truly
without
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
don’t
they
have
a
whole
jail
over
in
brooklyn
for
nothing
but
these
people?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
did
they
put
it
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
had
an
opportunity
to
pay
up
for
a
judge.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
the
state
supposed
to
give
more
than
an
opportunity?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
a
catalog
to
bring
him
up
and
take
him
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
judge
jones
issues
a
subpoena
to
sam
brown
to
appear
in
his
court
tomorrow
morning
as
a
witness
and
the
guy
says
“well,
he
must
be
crazy.
i’m
not
going.”
is
anything
necessary
other
than
but
a
judge
is
to
show
cause
order
and
put
him
in
jail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
didn’t
he
issue
a
cause
order
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
don’t
you
think
that
the
new
york
courts
could’ve
given
you
relief
without
striking
down
the
whole
batch
of
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
don’t
you
think
they
would
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
by
this
action
--
everybody
--
there’s
no
more
contempt
in
new
york?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
contempt
without
the
power
of
incarceration
any
good?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
all
of
these
statutes
are
unconstitutional
on
their
face?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
won’t
settle
for
them
being
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
what
class.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
my
case
is
that
this
man
was
subpoenaed
by
the
judge
to
appear
before
him
and
he
never
showed
up.
and
the
judge
issued
a
bench
warrant,
and
had
him
brought
in.
that’s
as
legal
as
anything
i
know
of.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
the
court
can’t
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i’m
saying,
you
don’t
find
anything
wrong
with
that
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
is
incarcerated
without
ever
seeing
a
judge.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
he
issued
a
subpoena
and
the
man
ignored
the
subpoena
without
ever
seeing
a
judge,
he
ignored
it
and
without
seeing
a
judge,
the
judge
issued
a
bench
warrant
and
put
him
into
cool
and
they’ll
do
it
every
day
and
there’s
nothing
i
know
of
illegal
about
it.
you
get
say
hearing
then,
yes
you
got
to
show
cause
here.
but
the
bench
warrant,
they’ll
pick
you
up
wherever
you
are.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
is
just
the
case
that
drawn
here.
the
court
wrote
on
that
they
didn’t
say
--
as
i
understand
on
page
2
(a),
they
say
just
to
the
opposite
don’t
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
order’s
court,
the
court
will
make
a
final
order
directing
that
he
be
punished
if
he
doesn’t
return.
all
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
opinion,
i
mean
once
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
once
the
court
issues
the
show
cause
order,
doesn’t
he
have
an
opportunity
to
go
in
court
to
show
anything
under
the
sun
that
would
convince
the
court
not
to
put
him
in
jail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
before
you
leave
ward,
what
about
on
may
he
was
served
with
a
notice
of
motion
for
order
finding
defendant
in
contempt
of
court
and
ordering
him
to
appear
in
dutchess
county
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
a
valid
order?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
disobeyed
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
wait
a
minute.
let
me
read
what
he
said
in
his
affidavit.
“i
did
not
appear.”
that’s
what
he
says
in
his
affidavit.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
he
disobeyed
the
order.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
solely
got
punished
for
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
number
11.
number
10
it
says,
“i
did
not
appear.”
in
number
11,
it
says
“in
may
i
contacted
mr.
grant.”
those
are
two
separate
statements.
justice
thurgood
marshall
getting
back
to
my
brother
rehnquist’s
original
question.
isn’t
it
strange
that
in
a
private
case
involving
money
etcetera,
etcetera,
etcetera,
it’s
necessary
to
knock
down
seven
state
statutes
in
order
to
give
relief
to
eight
people.
do
you
know
of
any
case
like
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
what
interest
do
these
people
have
other
than
their
own
rights.
they
don’t
have
any
rights
of
the
rest
of
the
people
in
the
state
of
new
york,
do
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
is
obverse
and
all
they
need
is
a
relief
for
that
class.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
don’t
need
the
relief
for
all
of
the
other
people
in
other
situations
governed
by
the
same
statutes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
where
does
the
interest
come
to
this
court
that
in
order
to
protect
these
people
we
have
to
knock
down
the
whole
world.
in
order
to
do
“justice
to
these
people.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
there
are
two
essential
violations.
the
most
essential
violation
is
that
they
have
been
incarcerated
without
having
the
assistance
of
counsel.
it’s
significant
that
in
the
federal
system,
every
federal
circuit
that
has
examined
this
problem
has
found
a
right
to
assigned
counsel
in
civil
contempt
proceedings.
most
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
are
not
before
us?
