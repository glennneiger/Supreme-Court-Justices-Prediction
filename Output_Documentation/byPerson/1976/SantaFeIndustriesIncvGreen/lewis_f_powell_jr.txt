justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
bender,
would
that
be
defrauding
you
if
i
offered
to
sell
you
a
stock
at
$150
per
share
and
at
the
same
time,
said,
here
is
an
appraisal
which
says
the
stock,
if
you
liquidate
it
and
were
able
to
sell
all
of
the
assets,
it
would
be
worth
$720
a
share?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
you’ve
omitted
one
very
important
fact
in
this
situation
and
that
is
that
nobody
has
forced
your
client
to
take
$150
per
share.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
wait
one
minute.
let
me
finish
the
question.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
have
the
right
if
you
think
that
this
wold
be
an
unfair
price
to
pursue
your
appraisal
remedy,
of
course.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
talk
so
fast;
you
don’t
give
me
opportunity
to
ask
any
question.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand
that.
i
will
try
not
to
interrupt
you
too
frequently.
the
district
court
found
there
was
no
misstatement
of
any
material
fact
or
omission
at
the
material
fact.
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
that.
you
are
arguing,
as
i
understand,
that
both
of
those
courts
are
wrong
in
that
respect.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
bender,
you’ve
placed
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
on
what
you
call
the
true
worth,
at
other
times
you
referred
to
it
as
a
fair
value,
the
fair
market
value.
suppose
somebody
asks
you
right
now,
what
is
the
fair
market
value
of,
say,
ibm
or
at&t
or
any
other
stock
that’s
traded
actively?
well,
take
international
paper
which
probably
owns
most
timberland
than
any
company
in
the
world.
where
would
you
go
to
find
that
the
fair
market
value
of
that
stock?
would
you
not
go
to
the
stock
exchange
quotations
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
disclosed
yesterday?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let
me
finish
my
question.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
fair
market
value
of
stock
always
is
equivalent
to
the
net
asset
value
per
share.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
you
are
right
on
that,
you
get
your
$752
a
share
or
whatever
it
is?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
bender,
suppose
the
corporation
in
a
short-form
merger
had
offered
minority
stockholders
$772,
would
you
be
here?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you’re
not
attacking
the
validity
of
short-form
mergers?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
you’re
talking
about
liquidation.
in
a
number
of
stocks
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
sell
at
prices
far
in
excess
of
liquidating
value.
let’s
turn
these
figures
around.
suppose
the
market
price
of
this
stock
by
the
appraisal
of
somebody
on
the
new
york,
one
of
these
investment
banking
has
as
such
as
the
one
you
mentioned
with
$772
and
the
liquidation
value
were
$150,
would
the
fraud
have
been
committed
on
you
if
the
liquidating
value
have
been
offered?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
want
it
either
way.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
bender,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
arguing
the
old
doctrine
of
vested
constitutional
right
of
a
stockholder
never
to
be
squeezed
out
for
cash.
