justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
bender,
are
you
defending
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
its
opinion
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
the
notion
that
you
were
cheated?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
wait
a
minute;
wait
a
minute.
on
the
basis
that
your
shares
were
undervalued?
justice
byron
r.
white
don’t
skip.
just
read
the
rest
of
the
sentence.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
stop
right
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
that
sounds
to
me
exactly
what
you
said
a
moment
ago
to
justice
stevens
was
your
personal,
philosophical
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
that’s
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
not
be,
i’m
talking
about
the
court
of
appeals
of
what
they
held.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
they
thought
something
else
was
necessary?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you
think
that
is
an
essential
part
of
their
holding.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
they
go
on
and
say,
we
do
not
hold
that
charge
of
excessively
low
valuation
by
itself
satisfies
the
requirements
of
rule
10b-5.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
but
we
also
assume,
don’t
we,
or
we
take
as
true
the
allegation
that
the
majority
stockholder
knew
it
was
worth
more.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
your
case
be
different
if
we
took
it
as
true
that
the
majority
stockholder
did
know
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
not
knew
that
it
was
fraudulent
but
knew
that
the
stockholder
didn’t
know
the
any
appraisal.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
disclosed,
it
disclose
all
the
facts,
they
had
an
appraisal
from
morgan
stanley
and
yet
they
said
that
they
put
in
this
report
--
the
valuation
was
much
higher.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
your
answer
to
my
last
question
is
that
it
wouldn’t
make
any
difference
in
your
case.
i
mean,
you
would
still
be
here
arguing
as
you
are
arguing
that
it’s
not
a
10b-5
violation
even
if
the
majority
stockholder
knew,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
that
isn’t
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
let’s
just
assume
this
case
is
exactly
the
way
it
is,
except
for
one
thing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
that
is
just
add
and
assume
that
the
majority
stockholder
knew
that
the
stock
was
worth
more.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
he
does
--
justice
byron
r.
white
was
he
supposed
to
disclose
his
opinion
that
it’s
worth
more
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
put
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he
disclosed
all
the
facts
on
the
basis
of
which
evaluation
judgment
would
be
made.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
on
that
basis,
you
say,
it
couldn’t
be
a
10b-5
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
whatever
his
private
opinion
on
what’s
the
evaluation
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
other
case
i
have
is
the
santa
fe
industry's
case.
this
comes
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
this
involves
a
delaware
so-called
short
form
merger
between
a
parent
and
a
subsidiary,
the
subsidiary
being
over
90%
owned.
this
merger
was
undertaken
for
the
sole
purpose
of
removing
the
minority
shareholders
from
the
subsidiary.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
held
that
this
was
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
by
the
majority
and
that
it
was
--
that
it
was
contrary
to
section
10
(b)
of
the
securities
act
of
1934.
we
reverse
that
judgment.
the
securities
act
and
the
regulations
under
it
prevent
and
forbid
misrepresentation
and
manipulation,
but
they
do
not
purport
to
supplant
state
law
and
to
the
--
and
major
generally
regulating
corporate
law
or
--
or
transactions
and
securities.
here,
the
complaint
alleged
neither
misrepresentation
or
manipulation
and
the
complaint
should
have
been
dismissed,
so
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
steven
says
each
filed
a
--
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
all
but
part
for
the
opinion
filed
which
i
have
filed
with
the
--
with
the
clerk.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
statement.
