mr.
sidney
bender
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
first
arose
because
of
the
fact
that
the
defendants
made
a
motion
to
dismiss,
so
that
all
of
the
allegations
and
the
fair
inferences
from
the
fact
stated
in
the
amended
complaint
are
deemed
to
be
true
for
purposes
of
this
particular
appeal.
now,
ernst
&
ernst
stated
that
the
1933
act
was
to
protect
investors
against
fraud
and
to
promote
ethical
standards
of
honesty
and
fair
dealing.
and
certainly,
the
same
stricture
applies
to
1934
act.
now,
1934
act
uses
the
term
manipulative
or
deceptive
device
in
contravention
of
the
rules
to
be
promulgated
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
the
sec
did
promulgate
10b-5.
10b-5,
clearly,
on
its
face,
covers
fraud,
and
this
court
in
ernst
&
ernst
when
it
was
talking
about
10
(b)
and
10b-5
used
the
term
deception,
manipulation,
or
fraud.
now,
deception
and
fraud
are
synonymous.
when
a
person
deceives,
he
may
deceive
by
nondisclosure
in
a
nonverbal
way
or
he
may
be
deceived
by
affirmative
misrepresentations.
clearly,
clauses
one
and
three
of
10b-5,
as
held
by
this
court
in
superintendent
of
insurance,
stated
that,
“misappropriation
is
a
garden-variety
type
of
fraud.”
the
most
important
part
about
the
deceit
and
fraud
in
superintendent
of
insurance
was
the
fact
the
majority
stockholder
used
the
funds
of
the
corporation
to
purchase
the
controlling
interest.
but
the
defendants
do
not
quarrel
with
the
schoenbaum
case
which
has
been
decided
in
the
second
circuit.
and
what
did
schoenbaum
decided,
it
was
an
en
banc
decision.
the
majority
stockholder
--
mr.
sidney
bender
yes,
your
honor.
should
i
get
to
that
right
now?
the
fraud
here
is
that
the
--
mr.
sidney
bender
yes,
i’m
sorry.
mr.
sidney
bender
alright.
the
fraud
here,
your
honor,
is
that
an
appraisal
was
made
in
february
of
1974
by
santa
fe
of
the
timberlands
of
kirby
lumber
company.
that
showed
a
fair
market
value
for
those
timberlands
of
$320
million.
the
book
value
was
$9
million.
now,
when
you
--
so
that
means
that
santa
fe
knew
that
the
true
worth
of
the
assets,
the
physical
assets
of
kirby
was
equivalent
to
$772
per
share
and
that
has
to
be
an
assumed
fact
that’s
been
alleged
and
it’s
accepted
as
the
fact
for
purposes
of
this
appeal.
now,
that
means
--
mr.
sidney
bender
no,
it
has
not
because
it
was
never
a
disclosure
to
the
stockholders
that
the
timberlands
were
worth
$320
million.
mr.
sidney
bender
yes,
i
will
but
wanted
to
first
get
into
the
fraud,
as
your
honor,
first
addressed
yourself
to.
now,
with
a
physical
value
of
$320
million
and
a
book
value
of
$9
million,
fair
market
value
means
that
kirby
could
go
out,
obtain
a
willing
buyer
and
sell
those
timberlands
for
$320
million.
for
our
purposes
and
for
valuation
purposes,
that’s
cash
in
the
bank.
so,
the
physical
assets
must
be
deemed
to
be
the
equivalent
of
$772
cash
in
the
bank.
now,
they
retained
the
prestigious
firm
of
morgan
stanley
and
company
to
come
in
and
appraise
the
worth
of
the
shares.
they
appraised
it
to
a
$125
per
share.
that
was
in
june
of
1974.
in
july
of
1974,
they
created
a
dummy
corporation,
forest
products
inc.
solely
for
the
purpose
and
it
stated
in
the
information
statement
which
went
out
after
the
merger
took
place,
solely
for
the
purpose
of
increasing
their
percentage
of
ownership
from
95%
to
100%
of
that
corporation
which
meant
eliminate
the
minority.
now,
then
in
end
of
july,
the
merger
effectively
took
place
between
fpi
corporation
and
kirby.
now,
there
was
no
notice
given
to
the
stockholders
and
what
was
the
effect
and
what
were
the
terms
of
the
merger.
the
terms
of
the
merger
were
that
santa
fe
decided
that
they
were
going
to
pay
the
minority
stockholders
unilaterally
a
$150
per
share.
no
stockholders’
meeting,
nothing
on
july
30,
1974.
there
was
no
reason
given
on
july
30,
1974
as
to
why
they
decided
a
$150
was
fair.
they
only
had
the
morgan
stanley
appraisal
which
showed
the
fair
value,
according
to
morgan,
at
$120.
but
morgan
had
in
its
possession
the
appraisal
of
appraisal
associates
which
showed
that
the
breakup
value
of
these
physical
assets
was
$320
million
just
for
the
timberlands.
mr.
sidney
bender
you
would
be
defrauding
me
mr.
justice
powell
if
you
had
in
your
power
95%
of
the
stock
which
meant
that
you
could
force
me
to
accept
$150
a
share
and
if
i
refuse,
despite
my
refusal,
you
voted
in
such
a
way
that
i
have
to
accept
that
$150
a
share.
and
the
mere
fact
that
you
disclosed
to
me
beforehand,
the
fact
that
direct
true
value
was
$720
a
share,
would
still
amount
to
a
fraud
because
you
were
breaching
your
fiduciary
obligation
to
me
because
you
would
be
in
effect
forcing
me
to
accept
by
reason
of
your
95%
control.
forcing
me
to
accept
the
transaction,
and
in
addition
to
that,
you
were
deliberately
undervaluing
the
shares
at
$150
a
share
when
you
knew
the
true
worth
was
$772
a
share
or
$720
--
mr.
sidney
bender
they
certainly
have,
your
honor
mr.
sidney
bender
i
am
sorry.
mr.
sidney
bender
but
let
me
first
answer
that
in
a
two-prong
way,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
on
the
date
that
my
clients
were
required
to
accept
the
$150
a
share,
they
didn’t
even
know
they
sold
their
shares
at
a
$150.
so
there
was
no
disclosure.
this
is
a
complete
myth
that
there
was
disclosure
before
the
fraud
took
place.
when
they
purchased
the
shares
of
the
minority
on
july
31,
1974,
there
was
no
disclosure.
they
had,
within
their
own
possession,
the
knowledge
that
they
had
an
appraisal
which
showed
the
true
worth
was
$770
a
share
and
it’s
no
different
than
a
majority
stockholder
who
knows
that
oil
has
been
discovered.
like
in
the
schoenbaum
case,
goes
to
the
corporation
and
says,
“gentlemen,
i’d
like
to
buy
your
treasury
shares
because
i’m
the
controlling
stockholder
at
the
prevailing
market
price
when
no
disclosure
has
been
made
to
the
public,
so
that
the
prevailing
market
price
does
not
reflect
the
fact
that
a
major
oil
discovery
has
been
made.”
in
schoenbaum
just
to
set
judge
hayes
in
the
second
circuit
said,
“a
clear
case
of
fraud
could
not
be
set
forth,
because
the
majority
controlling
influence
used
his
shares
to
force
the
corporation
to
sell
him
shares
at
a
totally
inadequate
price.”
mr.
sidney
bender
--and
a
fraud
on
the
minority
stockholders.
mr.
sidney
bender
i
am
sorry,
your
honor,
but
i
do
have
a
limited
time.
mr.
sidney
bender
no,
i
am
not
arguing
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong.
the
court
of
appeals
said
and
judge
mansfield
said
that
disclosure
after
the
consummation
of
the
merger
is
virtually
equivalent
to
no
disclosure
at
all.
and
that’s
certainly
true.
it’s
like
the
president
of
a
corporation,
dealing
with
securities
of
that
corporation,
were
to
abscond
to
florida
with
$15
million
of
securities
while
the
corporation
was
selling
securities.
after
he
gets
to
florida
the
next
day,
he
sends
a
warrant
to
the
corporation
and
says,
“gentlemen,
i
have
absconded
with
your
securities
and
here
i
am
in
florida.”
but
now,
because
of
that
confession
--
mr.
sidney
bender
i
am
sorry.
mr.
sidney
bender
of
course
he
has,
because
the
mere
fact
disclosure
does
not
mean
that
if
he
has
in
his
control
the
ability
to
still
steal
those
securities,
disclosure
doesn’t
cure
a
fraud.
if
i
have
the
possession
to
consummate
the
transaction
because
of
the
fact
that
i
have
95%
of
the
stock
in
my
possession,
and
i
tell
the
minority,
even
in
a
full
disclosure
case
beforehand,
which
didn’t
happen
here.
if
i
tell
the
minority
beforehand,
“gentlemen,
your
stock
is
worth
$770
per
share
but
yet
i’m
going
to
pay
you,
because
i
am,
the
majority
stockholder,
only
$150
a
share
and
if
you
don’t
like
it,
you
can
seek
an
appraisal
in
state
court.
now,
that
has
two
vices.
the
majority
stockholder
is
breaching
its
fiduciary
obligation,
number
one,
because
of
the
fact
that
he
has
the
ability,
because
of
his
95%
ownership
to
force
the
transaction
or
the
minority
even
if
they
say,
“no,
we’re
not
going
to
accept
it.”
he
still,
because
of
the
fact
that
he’s
a
95%
shareholder.
he
can
force
them
to
take
that
$150
or
seek
an
appraisal.
and
i
will
get
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
that’s
an
adequate
remedy.
and
why
is
it
a
fraud?
because
he
knows
that
the
true
worth
of
those
shares
is
$772
per
share
and
yet
despite
that
he
has
fixed
as
a
fair
value
only
$150
a
share.
mr.
sidney
bender
he
could
have
fixed
a
dollar
a
share.
mr.
sidney
bender
the
difference
between
the
--
mr.
sidney
bender
no,
they’re
not,
your
honor.
this
is
--
mr.
sidney
bender
they
are
not
synonymous
with
this
respect
--
mr.
sidney
bender
i
am
sorry.
they’re
not
synonymous
in
this
respect.
what
we
have
here
as
justice
powell
stated
in
ernst
&
ernst,
“what
is
required
under
10b-5
now
is
an
intent
to
defraud.”
now,
what
do
we
have
here?
we
have
a
fiduciary.
and
what
is
it
intent
to
defraud?
it
is
a
knowing
willful
conduct
to
misappropriate.
what
did
the
court
say
in
superintendent
of
insurance?
misappropriation
is
a
garden-variety
type
of
fraud,
and
that’s
what
we
have
here.
it’s
a
misappropriation
of
the
difference
between
the
true
worth
of
$772
and
what
they
agreed
to
pay,
namely
$150.
mr.
sidney
bender
well,
in
that
kind
of
case
--
mr.
sidney
bender
in
that
kind
of
case,
yes
that
would
be
true
now.
but
if
the
--
mr.
sidney
bender
i
am
sorry.
mr.
sidney
bender
not
always.
well,
not
s.
ex.
value,
if
it
was
going
to
be
liquidated
and
the
majority
stockholder
was
going
to
capture
the
underlying
values.
yes,
if
that
was
higher
than
a
capitalization
of
earning
situation.
mr.
sidney
bender
we
would
not;
not
under
delaware
law,
because
delaware
law
provides,
number
one,
that
they
will
not
consider
anything
except
historical
earnings.
it
doesn’t
say
anything
about
it,
in
fact,
the
cases
say
and
this
was
pointed
out
but
judge
mansfield
at,
i
think
it
was
page
138
to
140
in
the
appendix
in
its
footnote
that
it
does
not
pay
for
prospective
earning
power,
potential.
and
under
delaware
law,
you
are
not
in
an
adversary
proceeding.
i
couldn’t
go
into
delaware
and
obtain
a
discovery
and
inspection
of
this
company’s
books
to
determine
true
value.
only
the
appraiser
is
permitted
to
see
the
books.
furthermore,
the
delaware
law
has
this
further
shortcoming.
there
is
no
equitable
relief.
the
merger
could
not
be
set
aside
on
grounds
of
fraud.
and,
in
addition,
appraisal
is
your
exclusive
remedy.
procedurally,
if
i
were
the
party
to
initiate
the
appraisal
in
delaware,
i
cannot
go
to
my
--
to
others
who
have
sought
appraisal
and
seek
a
contribution
for
expenses
to
further
the
appraisal
proceeding.
and
in
addition
to
that,
this
crucial
evidence
of
potential
value
has
been
thereby
captured
by
the
majority
stockholder
at
its
whim
and
caprice
when
he
has
decided
that
it
is
time
to
buy
the
minority
stockholder
out.
now,
it’s
clear
under
regular
corporate
purposes.
what
is
this?
this
is
a
forced
tender
offer.
mr.
sidney
bender
yes
sir.
mr.
sidney
bender
that’s
correct.
mr.
sidney
bender
well,
i
think
now,
it
would
certainly
because
they
have
disclosed
it
after
the
fact.
mr.
sidney
bender
i
sure
did
have
it
in
my
possession.
that
was
the
reason
that
we
alleged
that
the
true
value
of
the
assets
was
$772
per
share.
mr.
sidney
bender
in
this
particular
case,
yes
but
in
fact,
the
value
of
those
timberlands
may
even
be
greater
than
$320
million.
i’d
been
in
many
proceedings
where
experts
have
been
retained,
sir.
and
with
all
due
deference
to
experts
when
they’d
been
retained
by
a
particular
party
to
give
appraisals
that
many,
many
times,
we
found
that
even
though
the
appraisal
was
substantially
more
than
what
appears
in
the
books
that
nonetheless,
that
that
is
even
an
understatement
of
the
true
worth.
mr.
sidney
bender
pardon
me?
mr.
sidney
bender
we
have
alleged
the
value
of
the
shares
were
at
least
$772
and
this
matter
has
proceeded
to
this
point
without
any
discovery
or
inspection
by
us
of
books
and
records
of
santa
fe.
this
was
strictly
a
pleading
matter
and
the
pleading
was
dismissed
on
the
face
of
it.
and
all
the
allegations
in
the
pleading
are
deemed
to
be
correct.
but
since
the
defendants
were
stuck
with
that
$772,
because
of
the
fact
that
after
the
fraud
was
consummated
they
disclosed
that
fact
to
the
stockholders,
then
we
come
to
the
situation
we’re
sure
we
have
it
to
allege
in
our
complaint
--
mr.
sidney
bender
that’s
correct
and
that’s
why
we
allege
that
morgan
stanley
rendered
a
fraudulent
appraisal,
because
--
gentlemen,
here
is
the
situation
where
$772
is
the
breakup
value
of
an
asset.
now,
what
is
happening?
the
majority
stockholder
is
simply,
at
its
time
and
at
its
price,
decided
to
pay
and
only
for
the
purposes
of
appearing
generous,
upping
the
price
of
$150
and
is,
in
effect,
paying
the
total
minority
of
25,000
shares
approximately
$3,800,000.
and
what
are
they
getting
back
from
the
minority?
they
are
getting
back
the
total
equity
interest
of
the
minority
in
this
corporation
which
is
truly
worth
close
to
$20
million.
mr.
sidney
bender
no,
i
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
bender
not
per
se,
i
only
say
in
this
particular
case
that
was
a
means,
a
device
utilized
and
abused
to
eliminate
the
minority
at
a
fraudulently
low
price
which
the
majority
knew
to
be
fraudulently
low.
mr.
sidney
bender
of
course,
it
would,
because
we’re
entitled
to
--
mr.
sidney
bender
well,
justice
powell,
with
all
due
deference
to
the
assumption
behind
the
question,
it’s
not
that
i
want
it
either
way.
i
want
it
that
the
stockholder
be
treated
honestly.
honesty
requires,
in
a
situation
like
this
that
if
the
fair
market
value
is
$150
--
i
mean
$772
wouldn’t
actually
is
entitled
to
that.
and
if
the
majority
stockholder
knows
that
the
shares
are
not
being
traded
at
all,
which
is
this
situation,
and
yet
knows
that
he
himself
can
go
out
and
sell
these
timberlands
for
$320
million
and
pocket
that
$320
million.
if
he
only
pays
the
minority
shareholder
in
a
pro-rata
basis
$150,
well,
he
is
gaining
the
difference
between
that
$150
and
$772.
what
could
be
a
clearer
case
of
misappropriation?
he
didn’t
ask
the
minority
stockholder
would
he
sell
it
at
$150.
he
told
him,
i’m
taking
your
stock
at
$150,
you
like
it
or
not.
mr.
sidney
bender
my
legal
theory
is
--
mr.
sidney
bender
well,
we
do
but
that’s
--
i’ll
explain
that
in
a
moment.
but
the
legal
theory
is
this,
yes
it’s
nondisclosure
but
it’s
more
than
nondisclosure.
it’s
at
knowing,
taking
--
it’s
a
knowing
devaluation,
knowing
undervaluation
--
mr.
sidney
bender
because
the
important
thing
here
is
that
a
fiduciary
owes
a
duty
--
mr.
sidney
bender
more
than
that.
of
a
self-deal,
he
is
sitting
on
both
sides
of
the
table.
mr.
sidney
bender
it
must
be
objectively
fair.
mr.
sidney
bender
that’s
what
i
want
to
say
to
you.
mr.
sidney
bender
i
would
say
this
that
on
the
facts
as
they’ve
been
presented,
it’s
not
critical,
because
in
my
opinion,
whether
or
not
a
majority
stockholder
discloses
the
facts
beforehand
or
not
is
irrelevant
in
a
case
where
he
has
the
ability
with
a
95%
ownership
to
force
the
transaction
on
the
minority
and
still
deliberately
undervalues.
but
i
am
stronger
than
that
because
i
also
have
nondisclosure.
mr.
sidney
bender
i
would
still
be
here
if
the
disclosure
had
been
10
days
in
advance.
mr.
sidney
bender
pardon
me?
mr.
sidney
bender
i
do
quarrel
with
the
delaware
procedure,
because
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
the
delaware
procedure
is
unconscionable
in
regular
as
judge
hayes
stated
in
the
marshel
case,
“a
majority
cannot
eliminate
a
minority
simply
by
voting
his
shares
under
regular
corporate
processes.”
so,
what
did
they
do
here?
under
delaware
law,
without
any
business
purpose,
they
create
a
dummy
corporation
solely
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
the
minority.
mr.
sidney
bender
in
my
opinion
sir,
they
all
do
conflict
because
they’re
performed
without
any
notice
to
the
stockholders.
mr.
sidney
bender
in
my
opinion,
any
freeze
out
--
mr.
sidney
bender
any
freeze
out
without
business
violates
10b-5.
i
add
without
business
purpose
because
the
purpose
here
is
just
to
create
a
dummy
corporation
for
eliminating
the
minority.
mr.
sidney
bender
well
--
mr.
sidney
bender
but
sir
--
but
business
purpose
means
that
a
purpose
other
than
just
to
eliminate
the
minority.
these
stockholders,
it’s
like
the
courts
said
--
mr.
sidney
bender
i
am
sorry.
mr.
sidney
bender
the
business
purpose
of
the
surviving
company,
it’s
the
business
purpose
of
consummating
the
merger.
and
there
must
be
a
business
purpose
to
consummate
the
merger
not
just
to
line
the
pockets
of
the
controlling
stockholder.
in
this
particular
case,
the
sole
purpose
of
the
merger
was
to
increase
the
ownership
of
the
majority
stockholder
from
95%
to
100%
and
also
to
cheat
them
at
the
same
time.
mr.
sidney
bender
because
sir,
in
my
view,
a
stockholder
--
mr.
sidney
bender
well,
under
regular
corporate
--
mr.
sidney
bender
for
cash.
this
was
a
public
company.
santa
fe
is
a
public
company.
mr.
sidney
bender
my
theory
is
and
this
is
not
necessary
to
a
holding
of
rule
10b-5
in
this
case.
i
want
to
say
that,
so
your
honor
understands
fully
that
it’s
not
necessary
to
my
position
in
this
case.
you’ve
asked
me
for
my
philosophical
opinion.
my
philosophical
opinion
is
that
it
is
wrong
to
squeeze
out
a
minority
stockholder
when
the
parent
corporation
is
a
continuing
public
company.
and
santa
fe
was
a
continuing
public
company
and
all
they
were
doing
was
--
mr.
sidney
bender
santa
fe
was
still
continuing.
the
parent
is
still
a
continuing
public.
all
they
were
doing
was
squeezing
out
the
minority
in
one
finger
of
their
joint
enterprise.
mr.
sidney
bender
your
honor,
this
is
why
i
cautioned,
made
my
comment
to
justice
stevens.
i
really
don’t
think
and
it
really
detracts
to
my
argument
to
really
get
into
the
question
of
whether
or
not
my
personal
philosophy
and
what
i
believed
happened
here
also,
is
necessarily
a
violation
of
10b-5.
that’s
really
the
perimeter
of
my
case
and
i
want
to
focus
on
what
i
consider
to
be
and
what
you
asked
before
justice
powell
or
justice
stevens,
i
forget
as
to
what
the
heartland
of
my
case
is.
and
heartland,
my
case
is
this,
that
when
a
majority
stockholder
with
his
95%
ownership
uses
that
95%
ownership
solely
for
the
purpose
of
increasing
his
own
ownership
from
95%
to
100%
and
at
the
same
time
knows
that
the
true
value
of
the
shares
of
the
minority
is
$772
and
deliberately
undervalues
those
shares
at
$150
then
he
has
misappropriated
the
difference
between
$150
and
$772.
and
it’s
an
intentional
misappropriation
under
ernst
&
ernst
and
for
that
reason,
we
have
a
clear
10b-5
fraud
case
and
they
used
the
device
of
the
short-form
merger.
mr.
sidney
bender
no.
your
honor,
i
am
glad
you
asked
that
question
because
this
is
what
we
stated
in
our
brief.
it’s
not
like
we,
the
plaintiffs,
came
in
and
said,
this
value
is
$772
a
share.
mr.
sidney
bender
right.
it’s
their
own
knowledge
that
we’re
alleging.
mr.
sidney
bender
pardon
me?
mr.
sidney
bender
oh,
certainly
we
can,
but
that
still
does
not
give
us
an
adequate
protection
because
you
have
stockholders
with
10
shares,
100
shares
throughout
the
whole
united
states
and
what
it
means
to
go
to
the
state
of
delaware
is
every
stockholder
has
to
retain
an
attorney
and
get
an
appraisal.
now,
you
know
your
honors,
that
as
a
practical
matter,
all
the
stockholders
are
not
going
to
do
that.
and
that’s
the
reason
these
corporations
proceed
this
way
and
in
delaware
because
the
net
effect
is
that
if
20%
of
the
minority
goes
to
delaware,
that
means
they’ve
already
gotten
away
with
the
misappropriation
on
80%
and
to
the
extent
that
delaware
does
not
give
a
proper
and
full
remedy,
then
that
means
as
to
the
20%,
they’re
still
going
to
gain
there.
this
is
an
incentive
not
for
a
high
standard
of
honesty
and
fair
dealing
but
on
the
contrary,
this
is
an
incentive
to
defraud
the
minority.
and
all
that
this
is
going
to
mean
is,
ultimately,
that
people
will
not
have
confidence
in
corporation
because
this
is
not
a
unique
situation.
this
is
happening
throughout
the
country
where
stockholders,
and
now,
there
are
39
states,
with
the
lowest
state
nebraska
saying,
“if
you
have
80%
ownership,
you
can
do
this.”
well,
that
doesn’t
mean
that
states
in
the
future
won’t
say,
“if
you
have
50%,
you
can
have
a
short-form
merger.”
and
what
does
this
mean?
this
means
the
elimination
of
the
minority
stockholders
and
you
have
a
further
concentration
of
wealth
but
in
addition
to
that,
people
will
not
buy
into
corporations
in
a
regular
public
market
for
fear
that
in
a
two-stage
situation,
namely
an
initial
tender
offer
to
get
over
the
required
80%
and
then
followed
by
a
freeze-out
merger,
people
are
cheated.
now,
that’s
all
this
amounts
to.
this
is
a
simple
cheating
of
minority
stockholders
because
the
majority
knows
the
true
value
is
$770
a
share
and
they
paid
them
$150.
what’s
to
stop
them
from
paying
them
$10
a
share
or
$1
a
share?
mr.
sidney
bender
oh!
yes,
i
certainly
am.
and
the
court
of
appeals
stated
these
things.
mr.
sidney
bender
oh,
certainly!
the
assumption
--
mr.
sidney
bender
well,
certainly
that
was
the
prime
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals.
in
part
b
of
the
court
of
appeals’
decision
by
judge
medina,
one
of
the
premises
and
the
assumption
in
judge
mansfield’s
opinion
in
a
footnote
was
that,
“the
fair
value
of
the
shares
was
$772,
and
what
was
being
paid
was
$150
a
share.”
first
of
all,
if
your
honors
would
look
at,
they’re
here
on
page
134
(a)
and
this
is
judge
medina’s
decision
and
conclusion
in
its
holding,
“we
hold
that
the
complain
alleges”
and
then
i’ll
skip,
“the
minorities
--
mr.
sidney
bender
oh!
alright.
“the
complaint
alleges
that
claim
under
rule
10b-5
when
it
charges
in
connection
with
delaware
short-form
merger
that
the
majority
has
committed
a
breach
of
its
fiduciary
duty
to
deal
fairly
with
minority
shareholders
by
affecting
the
merger
without
any
justifiable
business
purpose
--”
mr.
sidney
bender
right.
that’s
up
to
that
point.
mr.
sidney
bender
well,
i
said
that’s
the
perimeter,
the
perimeter.
mr.
sidney
bender
that’s
not
necessary
to
my
conclusion.
mr.
sidney
bender
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
was
necessary.
mr.
sidney
bender
i’m
not
deviating
from
that.
i
think
that’s
necessary
too;
i
think
this
is
an
important
--
mr.
sidney
bender
yes,
then
they
go
on.
the
minority
shareholders
are
given
no
prior
notice
to
the
merger;
thus,
having
no
opportunity
to
apply
for
injunctive
relief,
and
the
proposed
price
to
be
paid
is
substantially
lower
than
the
appraised
value
reflected
in
the
information
statement.
mr.
sidney
bender
i
think
it
certainly
is.
i
think
that
what
is
most
significant
here
is
that
the
corporation
knew
that
the
value
was
$772
per
share
and
yet
paid
only
$150.
mr.
sidney
bender
and
i
think
what
they
mean
there
that
if
we
were
a
stockholder
and
if
it
was
in
a
situation
where
you
have
an
arms
length
negotiation,
and
no
self-deal.
that’s
what
they’re
talking
about.
and
in
addition,
even
arguendo,
they’re
certainly
not
talking
about
our
situation
because
here,
the
plaintiffs
did
not
opine
that
the
true
worth
was
$772.
our
case
is
much
narrower.
our
case
is
that
the
majority
stockholder
knew
that
the
true
value
was
$772
and
yet
paid
a
$150,
and
that
is
a
fraud.
mr.
sidney
bender
thank
you
your
honors.
