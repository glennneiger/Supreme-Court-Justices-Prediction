justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
glendon,
is
that
really
a
significant
point
as
did
in
kirby
incurring
indebtedness
to
get
the
money
from
the
parent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
the
parent
--
it
was
just
capital
contribution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
glendon,
could
i
interrupt
for
just
a
second.
i
don’t
quite
understand
the
significance
of
your
argument
on
rewriting
the
delaware
statute.
if,
for
example,
the
delaware
statute
said,
“certain
information
shall
not
be
disclosed
and
it
required
that
there
would
be
a
nondisclosure.”
and
rule
10b-5
would
require
a
disclosure,
wouldn’t
10b-5
prevail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
the
event
that
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
delaware
statute
and
the
requirements
of
rule
10b-5,
rule
10b-5
would
apply,
would
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
your
argument
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn’t
your
basic
proposition
that
there’s
simply
no
violation
of
rule
10b-5?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
that’s
true,
then
it
doesn’t
matter
whether
a
violation
would
require
a
revision
of
the
delaware
statute
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bender,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
appraisal
dated
february
19,
1974
contains
this
fair
market
value
of
$320
million.
that’s
in
effect
an
admission
by
your
adversary
that
that’s
the
fair
market
value
of
the
tangible
asset.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
be
admissible
in
evidence
in
the
appraisal
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
at
the
time
you
have
filed
your
lawsuit,
you
had
that
appraisal
in
your
possession.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so,
all
of
the
information
on
which
you
rely
for
your
allegation
of
$772
per
share
is
available
in
that
appraisal
in
a
form
which
would
be
admissible
in
the
appraisal
proceeding
in
the
delaware
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
haven’t
alleged
that
the
appraisal
was
an
undervaluation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
not
alleged
that
the
appraisal
was
too
conservative.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
correct,
just
so
i
have
the
sequence
right,
that
after
the
february
appraisal
of
tangible
assets
had
been
completed,
that
appraisal
was
given
to
morgan
stanley
and
that
was
one
of
the
factors
they
considered
in
coming
up
with
$125
per
share
price?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bender,
is
it
correct
that
your
legal
theory
is
that
the
fraud
consist
in
the
failure
to
make
any
disclosure
before
the
transaction
is
completed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
you
don’t
complain
of
the
adequacy
of
the
disclosure
after
the
transaction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
does
that
have
to
be
so?
why
wouldn’t,
under
your
theory,
any
nondisclosure,
it’s
a
material
nondisclosure
if
you
don’t
tell
the
minority
shareholder
anything
until
the
short-form
merger
is
completed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
of
disclosure
in
advance,
isn’t
that
your
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
--
i
really
want
to
understand
your
theory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bender,
i
am
trying
to
understand
your
theory
not
to
debate
with
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
critical
to
your
case
that
there
was
no
disclosure
before
the
transaction
was
completed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
your
case
will
--
would
you
be
here
if
the
disclosure
had
been
10
days
in
advance
of
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
you
don’t
quarrel
with
the
delaware
procedure
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don’t
quarrel
with
the
delaware
procedure,
you’re
just
saying
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
say
--
then
am
i
correct
in
believing,
you
say
all
of
these
30-stage
short-form
merger
statutes
conflict
with
rule
10b-5?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
they
not
also
conflict
if
they
provided
for
notice
in
advance
but
did
not
give
the
minority
shareholder
the
option
to
say
no?
it
still
conflict
if
i
understand
your
theory
correctly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
any
freeze
out
violates
10b-5?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
on
the
business
purpose
point,
what
is
the
minority
shareholder’s
reason
for
being
interested
in
business
purpose
if
business
purpose
justifies
getting
them
out
of
the
company?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
has
no
interest
in
the
business
purpose
after
he’s
out,
so
why
should
that
be
critical?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
what
it
means
but
i’d
be
interested
in
your
answer
to
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
it
relevant;
why
do
you
attach
so
much
significance
to
the
business
purpose
of
the
surviving
company
as
a
justification
for
eliminating
the
squeezed
out
shareholder?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
leaving
out
the
“also
to
cheat”,
what’s
--
the
first
part
accepting
it
when
you
say,
how
does
that
conflict
with
rule
10b-5?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
he
could
be
squeeze
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
your
view
is,
he
can
never
be
squeezed
out
no
matter
what
the
statute
provides.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
you’re
right.
i
just
want
to
understand
your
theory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
not
after
they
own
a
100%
of
the
stock,
it’s
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bender,
if
this
is
the
heart
of
your
case
then
in
every
short-form
merger
case
or
every
merger
case,
all
the
minority
shareholder
has
to
do
is
to
allege
that
the
shares
have
a
higher
value
than
they
ought
to
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
allege
it’s
higher
and
the
other
side
it
didn’t
disclose
--
