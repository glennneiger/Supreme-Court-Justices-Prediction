mr.
william
r.
glendon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
william
r.
glendon.
i
represent
the
santa
fe
parties
who
were
defendants
below
and
are
petitioners
here.
in
this
proceeding,
there
are
raised
some
very
troublesome
and
even
startling
problems
by
the
decision
below
in
reference
to
the
scope
of
the
securities
laws
particularly
10
(b)
of
the
1934
act
and
further
the
entire
relationship
between
federal
and
state
governments.
the
case
arises
out
of
fact
that
the
plaintiffs
are
suing,
claiming
that
in
a
short-form
merger,
pursuant
of
the
delaware
statute,
the
price
that
they
were
given
of
a
$153
was
grossly
undervalued
and
that
this
constitutes
a
violation
of
scheme
and
contrivance
under
rule
10b-5
because
it
was
given
without
notice,
although
the
delaware
statute
doesn’t
require
any
notice.
in
fact,
all
the
delaware
statutes
were
complied
with
and
in
this
action
under
a
statute
requiring
manipulation
and
deceit,
it
is
clear
that
there
was
no
deceit
and
there
was
no
nondisclosure.
nonetheless,
two
members
of
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
conduct
pursuant
to
the
statute
was
a
fiduciary
breach
and
they
said
that
this
was
a
scheme
to
defraud.
the
dissenting
opinion,
judge
moore
said
to
say
that,
“the
facts
here
presented
a
scenario
of
defraud
--
of
fraud
was
patent
distortion
of
the
term.
it
was
no
fraud
at
all.”
the
facts
very
quickly
are
that
santa
fe
acquired
60%
of
the
kirby
lumber
company
in
1933
under
a
reorganization.
in
1967,
they
acquired
another
25%
at
a
price,
and
i
will
remind
your
honors,
the
price
claimed
here
to
be
undervalued,
grossly
undervalued
as
$160
--
as
$125.
in
1967,
the
remaining
25%
to
get
them
up
to
90%
was
acquired
at
the
price
of
$65.00.
there
were
additional
purchases
of
the
stock
in
between
1967
and
1974
at
prices
of
$65
to
$92
to
bring
them
up
to
the
number
of
90%.
under
the
delaware
law,
you
may
enter
into
a
short-form
merger
if
you
have
90%.
santa
fe
decided
to
invoke
the
provisions
of
the
delaware
short-form
statute
and
have
a
short-form
merger.
to
do
this,
it
did
a
number
of
things.
it
first
of
all
caused
appraisals
to
be
made
of
the
physical
properties
of
the
kirby
lumber
company
and
this
physical
appraisal
of
the
property
showed
a
value
of
the
asset
value
of
$320
million.
it
also
had
an
appraisal
made
of
the
mineral
properties
and
this
too
was
submitted
to
morgan
stanley
along
with
the
asset
appraisal
whom
santa
fe
had
engaged
to
give
it
an
independent
advice
as
to
the
fair
market
value
of
the
stock
of
the
minority,
the
fractional
shareholders.
the
morgan
stanley
did
an
appraisal
of
the
minority
--
of
this
value,
true
market
value
of
the
stock
and
came
up
with
a
figure
after
considering
a
variety
of
factors
including
the
appraisals
which
were
submitted
to
them
of
$125.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
the
very
thin
market,
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
it
was
not
even
traded
over-the-counter.
there
just
wasn’t
much
trading
in
it.
the
record
reflects
the
buys
by
santa
fe
during
the
period
1960,
1967
on,
and
as
you
will
see,
they
have
a
very
small
numbers
of
shares.
santa
fe
took
the
morgan
stanley
recommendation
of
a
$125,
increased
it
to
a
$150.
parenthetically,
this
would
be
12.5
times
earnings
for
the
previous
year.
it
set
up
a
corporation
called
forest
products,
inc.
to
implement
the
merger.
it
gave
forest
products
$3.8
million
to
affect
the
--
have
the
money
to
buy
in
the
minority
stock.
and
i
mentioned
this
because
the
lower
court
took
the
misapprehension,
was
under
the
misapprehension
that
kirby
itself
paid
for
the
stock,
that
the
stock
was
paid
out
of
kirby’s
fund.
this
simply
wasn’t
so.
the
parent
provided
the
money.
the
merger,
pursuant
to
the
statute,
was
affected
on
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
no.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes.
there
was
no
--
and
i
stressed
it
because
your
honors
will
probably
read
the
marshel
case
along
with
this
case
which
is
another
case
that
came
out
of
the
second
circuit.
and
it
was
great
--
stressed
later
in
that
case
that
a
merger
without
a
corporate
purpose,
where
the
company’s
funds
were
used
was
a
violation
of
10
(b).
and
i
just
want
to
make
the
distinction
here
that
that
didn’t
happen
here.
the
merger
occurred
on
july
1
--
on
july
31
and
on
august
1
the
next
day,
as
provided
by
the
statute,
notice
was
sent
to
the
fractional
or
minority
shareholders.
along
with
the
notice
and
this
is
very
important
to
our
case,
along
with
the
notice
went
a
ream
of
material,
describing
the
background
of
the
merger,
describing
the
merger,
describing
the
appraisals,
concluding
the
appraisals,
every
single
bit
of
relevant
information
that
could
possibly
be
put
out
was
put
out.
and
there
was,
in
fact,
there’s
no
claim
that
any
of
that
material
was
misleading,
that
it
misrepresented
anything,
that
it
said
that
something
was
only
a
half-through,
or
that
it
failed
to
disclose
anything.
there
was
simply
no
claim
with
reference
to
this
material.
indeed,
the
claim
itself,
the
fact
the
claim
of
undervaluation
is
based
on
the
figures
disclosed
by
the
information
we
gave
them
which,
in
this
compassing
strange
in
a
10b-5
nondisclosure
case.
we
moved
to
dismiss
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
took
a,
it
seemed
to
us
and
of
course
were
prejudice,
it
seemed
to
us,
took
a
realistic
and
rather
straightforward
view
of
this
case.
it
said,
there
is
no
deception
in
the
case.
it’s
a
10b-5
case.
there’s
no
claim
of
nondisclosure.
therefore,
it
is
not
a
10b-5
case
and
dismissed
it
to
the
claim
that
there
was
no
corporate
purpose.
it
said,
“you
don’t
need
a
corporate
purpose
in
delaware.”
to
the
claim
that
there
should
have
been
prior
notice,
it
said
the
statute
provides
proposed
merger
notice.
and
i
might
just
say
there
that
that
we
think
is
the
relevant
time
because
that’s
the
time
the
minority
stockholder
needs
the
information
in
order
to
make
an
investment
decision.
he
wants
to
know
at
that
time,
“do
i
accept
the
$150
or
do
i
seek
the
appraisal
rights
which
i
have
under
the
delaware
statute?”
so,
we
say
and
judge
breen
in
the
lower
court
said
that
this
was
proper
and
adequate
notice
under
the
statute.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i
would
like
to
reserve
three
minutes
for
rebuttal,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
as
we
suspended
yesterday,
i
was
referring
to
the
judge
moore’s
dissent
in
saying
that,
to
say
that
the
circumstances
here
presented
as
scenario
of
fraud
was
a
patent
distortion
of
the
term.
to
put
the
facts
into
a
little
sharper
focus,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
a
couple
of
matters
the
judge
medina
in
the
majority
opinion
in
approaching
the
subject
involved,
made
reference
to
schemes
of
loyal
and
cunning
and
so
sophisticated
as
to
almost
defy
belief.
in
fact,
as
judge
moore
noted,
this
circumstances
here
were
such
that
he
found
there
were
matters
of
utmost
simplicity
and
patent
reasonableness.
in
the
concurring
opinion,
judge
mansfield,
invade
against
the
idea
of
companies
going
public
when
the
market
is
flourishing
and
then
going
private
when
the
market
is
depressed.
in
fact,
as
the
records
will
show
us
here,
kirby
has
always
been
a
public
company.
the
price
that
was
paid
for
the
stock
was
much
--
offered
for
the
stock
was
much
higher
than
anything
shown
in
the
record
before.
we
don’t
know
what
the
plaintiff’s
basis
here
for
the
stock
was,
but
it
is
interesting
to
note.
i
think
it’s
at
page
102
of
the
joint
appendix
that
he
pleads
as
complaints
of
the
fact
that
he
is
going
to
have
to
pay
a
capital
gain’s
tax
on
this
transaction
which
is
certainly
a
most
unusual
complaint
of
a
victim
of
a
claimed
fraud.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
well,
he
does
have
--
he
has
another
action,
of
course,
of
getting
a
fair
valuation
and
the
delaware
statute,
as
i
pointed
out
mr.
chief
justice,
specifically
provides
in
this
part
of
his
contract
in
the
charter
of
the
corporation
that
minority
stockholders
can
be
eliminated
from
the
corporation.
i
think
the
first
principle
that
we
should
consider
here
is
the
fact
that
the
securities
acts,
the
1933
and
1934
acts,
are
disclosure
statutes.
this
court
said
in
the
affiliated
ute
case
that
the
philosophy
was
to
substitute
a
philosophy
of
full
disclosure
for
that
of
a
caveat
emptor.
we
think
the
court
below
ignored
that
as
well
as
ignored
their
own
holding
in
the
popkin
case
only
two
years
before
when
they
said
the
function
of
the
statute
is
primarily
to
disclose
and
inform
rather
than
becoming
involved
in
passing
judgments
--
becoming
a
master
in
passing
judgments
on
the
information
disclosed.
they
ignored
too,
we
feel
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
which,
as
this
court
said
in
the
ernst
&
ernst
case,
speaks
so
specifically
of
manipulation
and
deceit.
and
we
find
no
reference
in
the
court’s
decision,
the
majority
decision,
to
the
language
of
the
statute
itself,
and
we
think
that,
of
course,
we
must
begin
there
with
the
statute.
the
language
says,
“prohibits
manipulative
and
deceptive
devices
in
contrivance
and
contravention
of
the
rules
of
the
commission.”
and
to
us,
it’s
clear
that
that
means,
they
are
talking
about
deceit
and
deception.
the
court
of
appeals
met
this
problem
not
by
tackling
on
headlong
but
simply
eliminating
deception
and
deceit
from
the
statute.
even
though,
as
i’ve
said,
i
just
previously
stated
a
couple
of
years
before
that
the
disclosure
was
a
key
purpose
of
the
statute.
the
plaintiff
tries
to
avoid
this
problem
by
a
variety
of
references
to
other
cases,
other
statutes
relying,
principally,
it
seems
to
us,
upon
arguments
in
cases
which
invoke
matters
of
constructive
fraud.
but
the
statute
is
a
disclosure
statute;
it
did
not,
i
repeat,
did
not
try
to
take
on
all
the
wrongs
of
the
world.
it
said
and
the
congress
adopted
a
philosophy
of
disclosure,
and
it
says,
when
you
disclose,
you
cannot
make
deceitful
disclosures,
deceptive
disclosures,
and
that,
we
feel,
is
the
problem
before
the
court
today.
the
cases
that
this
court
has
considered
on
a
matter,
we
think
support
that.
the
plaintiffs
seem
to
get
support
from
the
bankers
life
case
but
that
was
a
clear
case
where
this
court
said
that
the
statute
should
be
read
flexibly
and
we
certainly
agree
with
that.
but
the
bankers
life
case
was
a
deception
case.
it
was
a
clear
case
of
deception.
the
court
referred
there
to
the
fact
that
misrepresentations
have
been
made
--
that
the
board
of
directors
had
been
duped.
so,
that
case
really
offers
no
help,
in
our
view,
to
the
plaintiffs.
the
court
too
has
said
that
the
statute
will
not
be
read
narrowly
and
that
artificial
barriers
--
and
has
removed
the
artificial
barriers
too
to
the
administration
of
the
statute.
for
example,
in
(inaudible)
in
the
bankers
life,
suggests
that
and
has
broadened
some
of
the
categories
in
terms
of
reliance
and
such.
but
it
has
not
and
has
never,
and
i
don’t
believe
it
should
or
could
remove
the
concept
of
deceit
from
the
statute
because
if
you
do,
if
that
is
done,
then
you
do
not
have
a
statute
that
involves
deception.
and
it
seems
to
us,
it’s
as
simple
as
that.
they
may
be
wrong,
but
people
can
lay
claims
too,
so
we
don’t
think
so
in
this
case.
they
may
be
conflicts
of
interest;
they
may
be
fiduciary
breaches;
they
may
be
actions
of
waste,
but
they
are
not
actions
for
deceit
and
the
statute
says
deceit.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
if
they
engaged
in
deception
and
the
disclosure,
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
they
would
and
the
popkin
case
made
clear
that
10b-5
in
a
short-form
merger
is
not
nugatory
thing
because
the
short-form
--
the
splinter
shareholder
has
an
investment
decision
to
make.
he
can
either
accept
the
offer
or
he
can
take
his
appraisal
remedy
under
the
delaware
statute.
i
think,
perhaps,
the
fallacy
in
the
plaintiff’s
approach
and
in
the
majority’s
decision
is
simply
that,
they
believe
that
every
wrong
or
possible
wrong
or
conceivable
wrong
that
may
arise
in
connection
with
securities,
shouldn’t
be
cured
by
the
application
of
10b-5.
i
will
discuss
later
what
that
may
do
to
the
federal
courts
but
quite
apart
from
the
result,
of
such
a
thing,
the
fact
simply
is,
we
feel
that
the
congress
never
intended
that
and
starting
as
we
must
to
clear
language
of
the
statute,
it
just
seems
there
is
no
basis
for
doing
so.
it
is
not
and
judge
medina
in
his
majority
opinion
recognizes
10b-5
is
not
a
panacea
for
all
wrong
doings.
it
has
a
limited
purpose
which
has
and
should
be
construed
broadly,
of
course,
but
it
has
a
limited
purpose
of
requiring
disclosure
and
having
an
informed
investor.
now,
the
court
below
passing
fraud,
moved
in
to
the
area
of
fiduciary
breach
and
it
engrafted
upon
10b-5
not
fraud,
but
said
that
there
was
a
fiduciary
breach
here.
we
do
not
think
that
fiduciary
breach
and
fraud
are
the
same
thing.
there
may
be
deception
in
a
fiduciary
breach
but
whether
there
is
overreaching
or
conflict
of
interest
or
other
aspects
of
fiduciary
breach,
they
do
not
come
under
10b-5.
we
think,
it’s
difficult
to
understand
how
the
court
did
that
but
then
to
engraft
a
fiduciary
breach
onto
it,
but
it
is
almost
impossible
to
explain
what
the
breach
was
here.
and
i
would
like
to
go
into
that
just
briefly.
the
court
said
that
the
allegation
of
gross
undervaluation
alone
was
not
enough.
that
was
not
a
fiduciary
breach.
but
what
it
said
was
that
undervaluation,
combined
with
a
lack
of
expressed
corporate
purpose
other
than
the
obvious
advantages
that
may
come
to
a
company
from
going
private.
but
the
court
said,
the
absence
of
another
expressed
corporate
purpose
and
the
absence
of
prior
notice,
although,
as
i
think
as
i
said
yesterday
that
delaware
statute
requires
post-merger
and
not
prior
notice.
the
court
said
that
the
combination
of
those
three
things
constituted
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
and
that
breach
resulted
in
a
violation
of
10b-5.
it
was
a
scheme
and
contrivance
and
artifice
to
defraud.
now,
that
we
think
is
a
startling
proposition.
it
has
the
obvious
vice
of
rewriting
the
delaware
statute
because
the
court
had
to
rewrite
the
delaware
statute
in
order
to
come
to
that
result.
the
delaware
courts
have
said
that
the
very
purpose
of
10b-5
is
to
permit
the
elimination
of
the
splinter
shareholders.
commentators
and
i
may
say
that
some
30
other
states
have
the
same
or
somewhat
provisions
where
minority
shareholders
can
be
eliminated.
so,
to
engraft
on
that,
a
requirement
of
corporate
purpose
nullifies,
in
effect,
the
delaware
statute.
secondly,
to
engraft
on
or
amend
the
statute,
which
now
says,
you
must
give
notice
10
days
after
--
within
10
days
after
the
merger.
to
say,
you
must
give
notice
before
the
merger
again
rewrites
the
delaware
statute.
judge
moore
said
something
to
the
effect
that
the
court,
while
it
was
engrafting
changes
on
corporate
charters,
was
also
putting
the
torch
to
erie
v.
tompkins
and
i
think
that’s
a
fair
statement
of
fact.
the
court
simply
rewrote
the
delaware
law.
now,
in
terms
of
corporate
purpose,
it
seems
to
us
that
apart
from
the
act
of
changing
the
statute,
and
not
supplementing,
not
supplementing
state
law
but
supplanting
state
law.
but
in
doing
that
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
well,
that
would
be
in
the
area
of
disclosure
and
that’s
what
the
statute
is
about
mr.
justice
stevens.
the
statute
requires
disclosure.
it
is
not,
however,
a
statute
that
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
but
we
are
saying
--
we
are
saying
to
you
here,
sir
that
there
cannot
be
that
conflict
under
this
aspect
of
the
case.
this
is
not
a
disclosure
requirement.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
it
is
a
regulation;
it
is
a
regulation
of
delaware
corporations
who
were
chartered
by
the
state
of
delaware
and
set
up
and
governed
by
the
laws
of
the
state
of
delaware.
and
the
state
of
delaware
says
that,
“you
may
eliminate
a
minority
shareholder.”
and
they
have
a
statute
in
the
courts,
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
who
said
that,
“the
very
purpose
of
that
statute
is
to
be
able
to
eliminate.”
that’s
what
it’s
about.
now,
what
the
court
has
done
here
is
said,
“you
have
got
to
have
another
purpose.”
now,
this
isn’t
disclosure;
this
is
not
under
the
disclosure
statute.
this
is
regulating
a
delaware
corporation
contrary
to
what
the
delaware
law
says.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
well,
what
we
are
saying
simply
is
that
to
get
to
the
result
that
it
got,
the
court
had
to
rewrite
the
statute
and
to
do
that,
to
take
a
federal
statute
and
apply
it
so
that
you
have
got
to
rewrite
a
state
statute
in
the
essence
of
a
clear
intent
by
the
congress
that
they
are
to
do
that,
an
expressed
intent
that
if
congress
had
said
here,
“you
may
regulate”,
and
they
may
pass,
they
may
pass
a
federal
corporation
law
and
say,
“everything
that’s
unfair
from
now
on
in
corporate
matters
will
be
governed
by
federal
law.”
but
they
haven’t
done
that.
they
have
said
simply
one
thing.
they
have
said
there
shall
be
disclosure.
and
what
i’m
trying
to
point
out
that
when
they
say,
not
only
disclosure,
but
when
they
say
you
have
to
have
an
expressed
different
corporate
purpose,
they
are
telling
delaware
how
to
run
its
collaborations
and
amending,
we
say,
the
statute.
they
amended
in
another
way
too,
and
that
is
on
the
fact
of
notice,
and
i
think
that
i
have
pointed
that
out.
and
this
is
interesting
i
think
because
that
requirement
is
a
useless
requirement,
really.
they
have
said
that
there
must
be
prior
notice
but
delaware
has
said
that
you
can
eliminate
the
shareholders
and
they
have
set
it
up
to
statutory
procedure
in
that
fashion.
there
is
no
pre-merger
going
into
court,
the
delaware
court
has
said,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
supreme
court
has
said
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
assume
any
situation
where
there
could
be
such
actual
fraud
as
to
set
aside
of
a
merger
because
the
whole
purpose,
whole
purpose
of
the
thing
is
to
--
of
the
statute
is
to
do
that.
so
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i
don’t
think
that
would
be
10b-5
case.
i
don’t
think
it
would
be
because
this
is
disclosure
and
this
is
what
we
are
talking
about.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
of
course
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
there
is
here,
of
course,
a
state
remedy
in
the
(inaudible).
if
they
don’t
like
the
price
that’s
offered
to
them,
they
go
to
the
appraisal
route
and,
in
fact,
appraisal
proceedings
by
others
are
going
on
now
in
the
delaware
court.
there
always
are,
i
suppose,
in
this
type
of
merging.
i
do
wish
though
to
advert
to
our
concern,
mr.
justice
stevens,
to
the
question
that
you
raised.
we
think
it
is
a
very
serious
matter.
we
think
that
the
principles
of
federalism
have
really
been
abused
by
this
decision
and
i
would
think
any
delaware
lawyer
or
delaware
legislator
would
feel
the
same
way.
they
have
determined
in
their
legislative
wisdom
that
this
can
happen.
it
can
happen
under
certain
circumstances
there
may
be
those
who
don’t
like
it.
they
may
be
some
who
feel
it’s
unfair.
there
may
be
others
and
38
states
have
felt
this
way
who
have
felt
that
elimination
of
minority
splinter
interest,
where
its
90
or
95%
ownership
is
socially
desirable.
but
that
is
not
a
question
for
the
courts
when
you
get
into
the
policy
of
that.
and
we
fear
that
that
is
what
the
majority
have
done
in
this
case.
your
honor,
i
think
at
this
point,
i
would
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
the
plaintiff,
i
think,
perceives
from
an
erroneous
assumption
as
to
the
facts
of
life
on
this
case
he’s
taking
an
asset
valuation.
and
basing
on
an
asset
valuation,
which
is
only
one
element
of
stock
valuation,
is
charging
a
fraud.
and
of
course
then,
charging
undervaluation.
of
course,
that
just
isn’t
the
fact.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
for
the
purpose
of
the
motion,
we
of
course
have
to
concede.
we
do
not
however
concede
anything
like
the
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
no,
there
was
no
such
allegation.
they
don’t
make
that
allegation.
and
that’s
the
point
here
if
you
have
to
read,
then
you
have
to
read
their
complaint.
they
charged
as
a
legal
conclusion
that
there
was
a
fraudulent
appraisal.
but
you
have
to
consider
it
in
the
light
of
what
was
disclosed
in
every
fact
that
the
plaintiff
says
constitutes
a
fraudulent
appraisal
was
disclosed.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
knew
that
there
was
a
fraudulent,
that
would
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
and
did
not
disclose
it.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
mr.
justice
white,
we
are
dealing
with
an
intangible.
we
are
dealing
with
a
value
and
we
can
do
no
more
than
disclose
all
the
facts
that
we
know
and
have
an
independent
appraisal
and
give
him
all
the
facts
that
we
have
and
then
disclose
all
of
them
to
the
stockholders
who
must
make
the
investment
decision.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
well,
if
the
majority
stockholder
put
out
what
he
knew
to
be
a
fraudulent
appraisal
and
didn’t
disclose
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
but
that’s
what
we’re
talking
about
mr.
justice
white.
we’re
talking
about
disclosure
and
we’re
talking
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
that
he
would
be
--
then,
i
think,
he
would
be
misleading
by
not
disclosing
what
he
knew.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
but
he
doesn’t
have
anything
here
to
know
anymore
than
what’s
on
the
record.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
no,
i
think
in
the
terms
of
opinion,
no.
i
think
that
the
only
thing
he
can
really
disclose
is
facts.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
you
can’t
commit
a
fraud,
i
don’t
believe,
by
an
expression
of
an
opinion,
and
particularly,
in
this
area
you
have
to
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes.
yes,
that’s
right.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
that’s
right.
yes.
when
he
makes
that
discovery
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes,
that’s
right.
that
would
be
our
position
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
alright.
