mr.
thomas
l.
hogan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
clarifying
one
factual
error
i
think
that
has
been
made
and
this
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
company
did
in
fact
accommodate
mr.
cummins
for
a
year?
on
page
173
of
the
record
and
the
question
was
directed
to
mr.
hedick
who
was
the
plant
manager
and
he
was
asked,
“when
did
you
become
aware
of
paul’s
religion’
and
his
answer
was,
“not
until
the
summer
of
1971
when
we
were
having
our
vacation
period.”
later
on,
on
page
178,
the
answer
to
a
question
was,
“i
asked
him
i
think
it
was
two
weeks
before
he
had
left,”
i
asked
him
if
there
was
any,
“i
knew
he
had
adopted
this
religion
a
year-and-a-half
and
i
asked
him
if
there
was
any
possibility
of
his
being
able
to
change
his
ideas
or
anything
like
that
and
he
told
me
that
he
was
firmly
fixed
with
his
religion.”
“is
that
when
you
decided
to
fire
him?”
“it
was
after
that.”
so
the
company
did
not
accommodate
mr.
cummins
for
a
year.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
mr.
hedick
the
plant
manager
was
there
for
a
year
before
he
was
even
aware
of
the
fact
that
mr.
cummins
was
not
coming
in
to
work.
mr.
cummins
of
course
had
been
told
by
previous
supervisors,
that
as
long
as
it
did
not
pose
any
problems,
he
did
not
have
to
come
in
and
work
on
the
shift
on
saturday.
this
was
based
on
the
past
practice
of
the
company
that
the
particular
department
that
mr.
cummins
worked
in,
the
bunberry
department,
historically,
operated
second
shifts
then
they
never
did
have
a
supervisor.
i
think
the
record
amply
shows
that
most
of
mr.
cummins
work
involved
scheduling
production
and
physical
presence
was
not
always
necessary
because
the
company
had
determined
that
due
to
the
financial
situation,
they
never
did
have
a
supervisor
on
the
second
shift
and
over
the
years
the
fact
that
when
they
did
have
one
because
production
was
low
and
any
problems,
any
deficiencies
in
production
started
back
in
1968
and
actually
reached
their
peak
in
1970
and
were
totally
unrelated
to
any
problems
or
any
difficulties
that
came
about
because
of
mr.
cummins
adoption
of
his
religion.
i
think
secondly,
more
importantly
is
the
question
of
what
congress
intended
by
the
enactment
of
this
amendment
and
that
was
to
put
a
burden
on
the
company
to
attempt
to
reasonably
accommodate
the
religious
needs
of
the
employer.
i
do
not
accept
the
counsel’s
argument
that
without
this
amendment,
that
mr.
cummins
would
not
have
been
protected.
i
think
the
argument
can
be
made
that
under
the
griggs
doctrine
as
applied
to
religion
cases,
that
this
is
a
policy,
a
saturday
work
policy
that
is
applied
to
everyone
uniformly.
it
does
have
a
disparate
affect
on
sabbatarians.
since
historically
this
company,
as
does
most
of
our
society,
schedule
any
additional
work
on
the
saturdays
rather
than
sundays,
and
in
this
particular
instance
in
fact
it
is
even
reflected
in
the
contract,
since
it
has
to
pay
time-and-a-half
for
saturday
work
and
double
time
on
sunday.
so
obviously,
sunday
work
is
only
achieved
as
a
last
resort.
mr.
thomas
l.
hogan
no
but,
in
this
particular
factual
situation,
i
say
it
is
uniformly
that
most
businesses
operate
on
saturday
versus
sunday,
if
they
got
the
choice
between
the
two.
mr.
thomas
l.
hogan
well,
yes
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
think
that
is
why
congress
passed
this
statute
was
to
protect
the
minority
sabbatarians
of
this
country
because
of
the
fact
that
without
this
amendment
or
without
the
application
of
griggs
to
the
original
title
vii
prescription,
there
really
is
no
benefit
to
sabbatarians
or
to
people
who
practice
a
religion
that
is
not
of
the
majority.
mr.
thomas
l.
hogan
well,
i
think
the
important
thing
is
in
the
amendment
of
course,
it
is
not
applied
just
to
sabbath
worship.
it
applies
to
other
instances
also
of
particular
needs
of
religions.
i
think
that
is
what
congress
is
created
is
a
balancing
factor.
in
fact,
i
think
they
have
in
effect
weakened
the
griggs
doctrine
of
a
business
necessity
doctrine
of
saying
now
there
is
a
lesser
standard
that
all
an
employer
has
to
show,
if
it
causes
an
undue
hardship,
it
is
directly
related
the
fact
that
they
are
trying
to
accommodate
reasonably
the
religious
needs
of
their
employee.
i
think
it
boils
down
to
basically
that
each
case
has
to
be
looked
at
in
its
own
particular
fact
situation.
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
could
write
a
broad
general
policy
that
a
particular
thing
for
a
company
to
do
will
always
be
sufficient.
it
would
depend
on
what
the
total
work
force
is.
it
would
depend
on
what
type
of
industry
it
is.
it
would
depend
on
each
factual
situation.
i
think
this
case
is
where
allowing
someone
off
on
their
sabbath
under
saturday
is
reasonable.
in
the
albuquerque
case,
it
would
involve
the
fireman,
it
was
impossible
to
do
so.
a
case
where
an
employee
maybe
able
to
be
demoted
or
transferred
to
another
plant
is
reasonable
in
one
instance,
if
there
is
not
another
plant,
then
he
can
not
be
transferred
and
it
is
a
small
operation,
but
i
think
these
are
the
issues
that
are
going
to
have
to
be
determined
by
the
eeoc
or
by
district
courts.
the
main
thing
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
instance
and
the
important
thing
i
think
is
that
the
commission
on
human
rights,
who
is
the
actual
trier
of
facts,
misapplied
the
law
because
they
reasoned
that
as
long
as
this
policy
was
applied
uniformly,
that
is
was
there
for
legal
and
that
the
company
was
able
to
do
that.
the
only
problems
and
the
undue
hardship
is
reflected
in
the
record
and
that
was
testified
to,
is
the
fact
that
there
was
consternation
among
the
other
employees
which
i
think
is
probably
going
to
be
true
in
most
instances,
particularly
here
where
the
company
did
nothing
to
try
to
eliminate
that
problem.
the
fact
is
that
other
employees
were
working
more
hours
than
mr.
cummins.
mr.
cummins
was
making
as
much
money
as
the
other
supervisors
and
in
some
instances
more
money
than
some
of
the
supervisors.
however,
the
company
seems
to
say
that
mr.
cummins
did
not
volunteer
to
do
anything.
well,
the
obvious
answer
is
the
other
employees
did
not
volunteer
to
work
72
hours.
the
company
ordered
them
to
work
72
hours.
mr.
cummins
went
to
the
company
at
the
very
beginning
and
said
“i
will
do
whatever
is
necessary.”
“tell
me
what
to
do.”
they
asked
him
to
volunteer.
so
he
did
on
instances
that
he
volunteered.
now,
the
question
is
all
the
company…
mr.
thomas
l.
hogan
well,
the
question
was
he
volunteered
on
numerous
instances.
the
question
that
has
arisen
now
and
i
think
it
is
mainly
arisen
in
the
briefs
of
the
petitioner
is
that
at
one
point
he
stopped
volunteering
and
i
do
not
think
the
record
does
reflect
that.
counsel
stated
that
mr.
cummins
volunteered
in
1970,
but
he
did
not
volunteer
in
1971
and
on
page
153
of
the
record,
the
question
was,
“did
paul
ever
volunteer
to
work
for
you
at
any
other
day
besides
saturday?”
the
answer
from
mr.
fame,
“well
now,
when
we
were
in
vacation
schedule,
he
came
over
and
said
i
will
help
you
out
when
you
need
me.”
well
vacation
schedule
was
the
summer
of
1971.
the
obvious
problem
mr.
cummins
had,
is
where
he
had
three
other
supervisors
and
the
company
gave
him
no
direction.
they
expected
him
to
prepare
his
own
work
schedule.
they
singled
him
out
because
of
his
beliefs.
they
did
not
require
the
other
supervisors
to
prepare
their
work
schedules.
mr.
thomas
l.
hogan
well
yes
sir,
and
of
course
albeit
they
separated
paul
from
the
group
of
the
other
three,
the
obvious
solution…
mr.
thomas
l.
hogan
the
company
did.
mr.
thomas
l.
hogan
no,
but—
mr.
thomas
l.
hogan
no,
what
i
am
saying,
when
it
came
to
scheduling
hours,
they
scheduled
them
for
72
and
the
plant
manager
even
testified,
“yes
we
could
have
scheduled
paul
to
work
4
hours
in
the
afternoon,
to
work
12
hour
shifts
during
the
week
to
take
away
from
the
other
supervisors.”
but
he
did
not
schedule
him
to
do
that
because
the
plant
manager
felt
that
the
way
to
solve
the
problem
was
for
paul
to
be
a
volunteer,
for
him
to
go
over
an
offer
and
the
other
supervisors
were
in
the
same
position
and
they
testified
that
they
did
not
think
that
it
was
their
position
to
have
to
go
over
to
another
supervisor.
they
were
all
looking
to
the
company
for
some
direction.
the
company
simply
had
to
sit
down
all
four
supervisors
and
say
“mr.
cummins
will
not
work
on
his
sabbath,
because
we
are
obligated
under
the
law
to
accommodate
him,
therefore,
let
us
prepare
a
schedule
to
equalize
as
much
as
possible.”
mr.
thomas
l.
hogan
well,
this
is
the
argument
on
what
the
employer
did
if
the
supervisors—
mr.
thomas
l.
hogan
that
he
was
allowed
off
on
saturday,
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
hogan
yes
sir,
he
was
allowed
off.
mr.
thomas
l.
hogan
well,
what
i
am
saying
is—
mr.
thomas
l.
hogan
no,
certainly
not.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
far
as
now
that
the
company
is
saying
that
this
accommodation
caused
problems.
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
it
would
have
caused
problems
if
the
supervisor
who
was
running
the
plant,
was
not
even
aware
of
the
accommodation.
so
there
is
a
testimony
in
the
record…
mr.
thomas
l.
hogan
well,
what
i
am
saying
is,
any
accommodation,
the
fact
that
mr.
cummins
was
not
there
on
saturday,
had
absolutely
no
affect
on
the
business
operation
on
this
company.
did
it
cause
no
undue
hardship?
the
only
undue
hardship
in
the
record
at
all
is
the
fact
that
it
has
caused
dissention
among
some
of
the
employees
and
i
think
that
under
statute,
that
the
obligation
on
the
company
is
to
deal
with
the
dissention
and
not
as
they
did
here
ask
mr.
cummins
to
change
his
religion.
mr.
thomas
l.
hogan
well,
one
of
the
problems
you
had
with
moral,
was
one
of
the
supervisors
had
formerly
been
an
hourly
employee,
he
was
them
promoted
to
supervision
and
then
told
to
work
72
hours
a
week
and
his
objections
was
not
to
the
fact
to
what
was
mr.
cummins
was
doing.
his
objection
was
that
he
was
no
longer
being
paid
overtime.
we
had
a
situation
here
and
i
think
this
is
very
important
too,
there
was
a
temporary
situation.
there
was
a
strike
at
the
other
plant
which
caused
increased
production.
obviously,
the
company
testified
they
only
worked
saturday
when
they
have
to.
you
had
a
vacation
situation
which
required
the
other
employees
to
work
additional
hours.
i
think
it
is
only
natural
that
if
one
employee
is
working
72
hours
and
the
other
one
is
40
and
making
the
same
amount
of
money,
that
the
one
who
is
working
72
is
going
to
have
a
little
bit
of
dissention
in
him.
mr.
thomas
l.
hogan
well,
that
is
why
i
say
it
is
a
balancing
factor.
if
an
employee
said
that
“my
religion
says,
i
have
to
have
a
three
hour
lunch
period.”
then
an
employer
can
say
“well
we
can
not
do
that.”
here,
mr.
cummins
just
said
he
could
not
work
from
his
friday
sundown
until
saturday
sundown,
but
he
would
do
whatever
was
necessary
to
make
up
the
additional
hours
to
equalize
it
and
then
the
company
who
could
have
come
forth
and
would
have
said,
“alright
this
is
the
reasonable
accommodation
we
are
offering
you.”
and
of
course
then,
if
he
rejected
that,
then
perhaps
they
would
have
had
a
legitimate
reason
for
firing.
what
they
did,
they
went
back
to
him
and
they
told
him,
“you
work
something
out,”
i
do
not
think
that
was
what
congress
intended.
the
accommodation
is
on
the
employer,
it
is
not
on
the
employee.
that
is
where
the
burden
is
been
put.
the
company
keeps
trying
to
say
that
this
is
an
equal
type
of
partnership.
it
only
is
once
the
company
comes
forth
then
the
burden
shifts
back
to
the
employee
to
either
accept
or
reject
whatever
the
accommodation
is
and
then
of
course,
it
all
has
to
be
viewed
in
like
of
the
reasonableness
and
the
fact
of
what
undue
hardship
it
will
have
on
the
company.
mr.
thomas
l.
hogan
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
since
i
have
yielded
ten
minutes
of
my
time
to
the
united
states,
i
would
just
like
to
touch
very
briefly
on
the
constitutional
issue
and
let
him
devote
the
majority
of
his
time
and
the
one
and
important
point
that
i
would
like
to
make,
is
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
company
is
arguing
both
sides
that
i
do
not
think
you
can
argue
that
the
accommodation
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
at
the
same
time
say
that
the
basic
prohibition
of
discrimination
against
religion
is
constitutional.
and
i
base
that
on
the
argument
that
i
think
that
a
proper
interpretation
of
griggs
and
the
disparity
affect
cases
compels
a
finding
that
a
reasonable
accommodation
would
have
had
to
have
been
made.
if
a
person
is
in
a
particular
position,
because
of
their
religion,
then
i
think
under
griggs
and
assuming
that
position
has
no
basis
to
their
qualifications
to
perform
jobs
or
to
the
job
requirements,
then
griggs
would
dictate
that
their
religion
would
have
to
be
accommodated
to
some
extent
and
with
that,
i
will
yield
to
the
united
states,
thank
you.
