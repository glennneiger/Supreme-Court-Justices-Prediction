mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
does
not
agree
with
the
petitioner
that
the
duty
to
reasonably
accommodate
an
employee’s
religious
practices,
so
long
as
it
does
not
cause
an
undue
hardship
on
the
operation
of
the
business,
is
really
totally
separate
duty
from
the
basic
obligation
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
law,
to
avoid
discrimination
of
the
basis
of
religion.
indeed,
the
reasonable
accommodation
requirement
was
first
adapted
by
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
in
1967
as
an
interpretation
of
the
basic
obligation
five
years
before
the
congress
amended
the
statute
to
indicate
its
agreement
with
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
on
this
subject.
under
this
court’s
decision
in
griggs,
the
basic
prohibition
is
directed
not
merely
to
the
motivation
of
employment
discrimination,
but
to
the
consequences
of
practices
on
persons
because
of
their
race,
religion
etcetera,
regardless
of
how
well
motivated
and
evenhandedly
applied
the
particular
employment
practices
might
be.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
dealing
with
employment
tests
that
had
a
disparate
impact
in
that
case
on
the
basis
of
race
and
the
question
was
whether
the
tests
were
sufficiently
related
to
the
business
needs
of
the
employer
to
be
a
fair
measure
of
employment
opportunities
or
whether
the
disparate
consequences
were
a
violation
of
basic
prohibition.
similarly,
a
facially
neutral
across-the-board
rule,
that
when
called
upon
to
do
so,
every
employee
must
work
on
saturday
has
a
grossly
disparate
impact
on
certain
employees
because
of
their
religion
and
similar
approach
should
be
taken
under
the
griggs
test
itself,
whether
there
are
sufficient
reasons
related
to
the
business
needs
of
the
employer
to
require
an
employee
to
be
put
into
the
position
of
having
to
choose
between
the
dictates
of
his
religion
or
possibly
forfeiting
his
livelihood
in
that
situation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
our
point
is
that
the
1972
amendment
really
represents
a
reasonable
legislative
solution
to
the
question
of
how
do
you
determine
when
a
practice
has
the
forbidden
consequence
of
an
employment
practice
that
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
religion.
it
is
not
simply
a
motivational
question
and
congress
recognized
that
in
adapting
the
1972
amendment
in
light
of
eeoc’s
experience
in
trying
to
make
that
determination
in
these
cases
where
persons
complained
that
they
were
being
forced
to
the
choice
between
the
dictates
of
their
conscience
and
the
employers’
demands,
that
they
observe
a
facially
neutral
requirement.
so
it
is
an
outgrowth
and
a
reasonable
legislative
drawing
of
the
line
to
determine
when
an
employment
practice
is
justified
in
terms
of
the
needs
of
the
business
or
where
it
has
the
forbidden
consequence
because
of
its
disparate
impact.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
he
is
not
managing
the
plant
to
make
the
accommodation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
statute
says
that
the
employer
is
to
make
a
reasonable
accommodation
to
the
religious
practice
of
the
employee,
that
is
what
the
statute
says,
and
quite
properly
so
because
it
is
the
management
that
makes
the
decision
as
to
how
working
hours
can
be
arranged
so
is
to
reasonably
accommodate
the
needs
of
these
employees
or
how
they
cannot
be
and
that
is
the
approach
that
both…
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
this
case
as
i
read
the
record
in
this
case
i
think
the…
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that…
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
not
what
the
statute
requires
the
employee
to
do.
it
could
be
the
result
that
the
employer
could
accept
in
the
particular
case,
but
the
statute
does
not…
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
in
this
case…
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
there
was
no
possibility
of
substituting
additional
longer
working
hours
because
of
the
nature
of
the
business
on
other
days
then
the
only
other
possibility
would
be
to
negotiate
an
appropriate
reduction
in
salary
based
on
the
reduced
work
hours
of
the
particular
employee.
but
the
circumstances
of
a
case
will
dictate
what
can
be
a
reasonable
accommodation
and
there
can
be
several
possibilities
for
a
reasonable
accommodation.
as
i
read
the
record
in
this
case,
i
think
the
company
did
to
the
extent
it
was
aware
of
the
problem,
make
a
reasonable
accommodation
for
the
initial
period
in
which
the
respondent
here
started
to
observe
saturday
as
his
sabbath
and
it
was
only
during
the
summer
of
1971,
when
the
increased
work
load
came
along
due
to
a
strike
in
a
lexington
plant
and
to
vacation
schedules
in
the
plant,
that
the
company
really
did
not
fulfill
its
obligation
by
making
further
adjustments
to
utilize
the
respondent
and
have
him
carry
his
full
share
of
the
extra
work
load
along
with
the
other
supervisors.
as
mr.
hogan
said,
the
other
supervisors
were
assigned
the
duties
that
they
had
and
were
told
when
they
would
have
to
work
on
saturday
to
cover
for
mr.
cummins
etcetera.
yet
the
company
refused
to
assign
mr.
cummins
to
extra
work
during
the
week
to
cover
for
the
other
employees
where
it
could
very
well
have
equalized
the
assignments
out
by
giving
mr.
cummins
extra
hours
during
the
week
and
if
those
extra
hours
were
on
the
second
shift,
then
have
the
second
shift
supervisor
sometimes
relieve
the
first
shift
supervisor,
so
that
all
of
them
could
have
had
some
relief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
could
have
been
difficulties
existing
there,
but
if
there
were
it
was
up
to
the
company
to
bring
them
to
the
attention
of
the
finders
of
fact
in
the
case
and
it
did
not
do
so.
what
appears
on
the
record
is
that
it
was
common
practice
in
that
company
for
the
bunberry
department
of
which
was
mr.
cummins
was
a
supervisor
to
operate
without
a
supervisor
of
its
own
and
to
have
that
job
covered
by
others
and
that
it
was
common
practice
for
supervisors
to
substitute
for
each
other
on
occasion.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
the
district
court
made
no
findings
of
fact.
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
district
court
on
the
record
that
had
been
developed
before
the
state
commission.
and
the
district
court
wrote
a
very
short
opinion
which
merely
says
that,
on
that
record
it
found
that
the
company
had
made
a
reasonable
accommodation
and
no
more
should
be
required
of
it.
and
so
the
court
of
appeals
quite
properly
had
to
look
to
the
underlying
facts
to
determine
whether
applying
proper
legal
standards
to
those
undisputed
facts,
that
result
was
correct
or
not
and
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
district
court
erred
in
that
regard
and
the
only
findings
that
we
have
are
reflected
in
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion.
but
nothing
was
brought
out
into
the
hearing
as
to
any
reasons
why
the
company
could
not
have
made
assignments
of
that
sort.
in
the
limited
time
remaining,
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
1972
amendment
to
title
vii.
there
is
no
general
principle
under
this
court’s
decisions
that
it
is
necessarily
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause
for
one
person
to
be
required
to
adjust
his
conduct
in
some
way,
because
of
the
religious
practices
or
observances
of
another.
in
fact,
this
court’s
decisions
hold
precisely
the
opposite
that
it
is
appropriate.
it
is
exercise
of
legislative
power
in
particular
circumstances
to
require
individuals
to
adjust
their
conduct
in
a
way
that
will
further
in
a
neutral
way
the
free
exercise
of
religion
and
avoid
unnecessary
clashes
with
religious
conscience.
one
example
of
that
or
rather
simple
one
is
gallagher
against
crown
couture
markets.
one
of
the
sunday-closing
law
cases
in
which
8
justices
upheld
against
an
establishment
clause
attack
the
constitutionality
of
provisions
of
that
particular
sunday-closing
law
which
forbad
the
carrying
on
of
certain
activities
within
a
prescribed
distance
of
a
place
of
worship
on
sundays.
this
affected
where
people
could
parade.
it
affected
where
people
could
conduct
athletic
events.
all
in
deference
to
furthering
the
free
exercise
of
religious
observances
at
the
churches
that
were
being
protected
and
this
court
held
that
this
does
not
force
anyone
else
to
attend
those
services
to
adapt
any
kind
of
religious
belief
or
practice
and
that
it
was
a
permissible
exercise
of
state
power
to
reach
other
persons
in
this
way
in
order
to
protect
the
free
exercise
of
religion.
another
example
of
that
which
we
developed
in
our
brief
at
some
length
is
zorac
against
clausen
in
which
those
school
children
who
did
not
choose
to
attend
the
religious
instruction
given
outside
the
school
room,
were
kept
in
school
at
the
regular
attendance,
even
though
the
state
forbad
continued
instruction
during
that
period
which
would
cause
educational
problems
and
cause
those
who
stayed
behind
to
forge
ahead
of
their
classmates
and
in
dissent
mr.
justice
jackson
went
so
far
as
to
say
the
school
is
being
used
as
a
jail
for
those
students
who
chose
not
to
go
to
church
in
those
circumstances.
nonetheless,
that
was
upheld
and
probably
the
most
extreme
example
is
the
court’s
upholding
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
conscientious
objectives
provisions
of
the
selective
service
laws,
even
though
they
necessarily
mean
that
some
people
will
be
conscripted
into
military
service
in
place
of
those
who
are
the
conscientious
objectors
or
will
be
sent
into
combat
in
place
of
those
who
object
to
that
kind
of
military
service
based
on
their
religious
scruples.
this
kind
of
accommodation
has
been
called
in
opinions
of
this
court
among
our
finest
traditions
and
is
not
really
different
in
kind
from
the
adjustments
that
were
made
by
the
clerk
in
the
argument
schedule
of
the
court
last
week
and
this
week
because
of
religious
holidays
in
re-arranging
some
of
the
oral
arguments
of
the
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
these
are
all
matters
of
degree
mr.
justice
and
i
do
want
to
say
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
upheld
the
undue
hardship
in
the
operation
of
the
business
defense
in
a
number
of
instances
in
the
context
of
this
kind
of
claim.
i
do
not
think
the
facts
this
case
come
close
to
the
difficulties
that
were
shown
there.
there
was
no
extra
expense
to
the
employer
here
caused
as
a
factor
that
has
taken
into
account,
the
availability
of
substitute
employees,
the
effect
on
other
employees,
the
possibility
of
having
to
be
on
call
for
emergency
service,
factors
of
that
sort
have
been
reviewed
in
the
opinions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
treatment
that
has
have
been
accorded
is
facially
equal
treatment,
just
as
mrs.
sherbert
was
afforded
facially
equal
treatment
by
south
carolina
in
refusing
her
unemployment
compensation
benefits
along
with
anyone
else
who
refused
to
take
a
job
that
required
work
on
saturday.
some
people
might
have
preferred
to
be
at
home
with
their
school
aged
children,
etcetera.
there
may
have
been
substantial
reasons
why
they
refused
to
take
such
employment,
but
if
the
dictates
of
one’s
conscience,
one’s
religion
forbid
working
on
that
day
and
leave
the
person
with
no
conscientious
choice,
you
are
into
a
situation
where
the
facially
equal
treatment
has
grossly
disparate
affects
on
individuals
and
causes
a
great
hardship
of
having
to
choose
between
the
dictates
of
one’s
most
deeply
held
beliefs
and
ones
livelihood.
and
there
is
an
area
where
the
legislature,
i
think
quite
properly
can
go
behind
facially
equal
treatment
to
see
if
there
are
ways
of
accommodating
people
so
that
they
can
carry
their
full
share
of
the
work
responsibility
and
still
not
have
their
beliefs
compromised
in
this
way
in
comparison
with
others
who
might
be
observing
their
sabbath
on
a
day
when
the
company
ordinarily
does
not
require
them
to
work.
they
may
not
be
faced
with
the
same
problem
at
all.
it
is
an
area
that
has
required
difficulties
and
adjustment
before
the
1964
law
was
enacted.
those
difficulties
were
faced
by
employers
in
making
ad
hoc
decisions
and
they
were
faced
in
the
collective
bargaining
process
and
as
part
of
the
1964
concern
with
the
equality
of
employment
opportunities,
congress
has
stepped
into
this
field
in
exercising
its
commerce
power.
