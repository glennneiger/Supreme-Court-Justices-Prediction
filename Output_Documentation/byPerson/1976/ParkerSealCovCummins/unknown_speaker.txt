unknown
speaker
then
they
also
singled
out
to
others
because
of
that
belief
and
tell
them
they
had
to
work
overtime?
unknown
speaker
who
separated
them?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
he
did?
unknown
speaker
the
company
did
not
join
the
church
he
joined
the
church?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
he
did
try
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
did
for
a
year,
the
employer,
to
accommodate?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no.
did
not
the
court
of
appeals
say
that?
unknown
speaker
did
it
not
the
court
of
appeals
say
that
the
company
tried
to
accommodate
themselves
to
this
problem
for
a
year?
unknown
speaker
well
you
are
saying
that
they
did
not?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
want
to
disagree
with
court
of
appeals,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
want
us
to
say
that
they
never
accommodated,
the
company,
never
did.
unknown
speaker
is
dissention
on
the
moral
problem
with
other
employees
from
the
accommodation
process?
unknown
speaker
but
what
you
are
saying
suggests
that
this
gentleman
expected
the
whole
establishment
to
revolve
around
him
to
accommodate
him.
that
other
employees
would
have
to
be
imposed
upon
one
way
or
another
in
order
to
grant
him
a
total
freedom
of
saturday
work
and
you
say
that
an
employer
must
continue
to
tolerate
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
another
point
what
is
your
idea
of
whose
burden
on
this
accommodating
business
is?
i
should
think
the
employer,
the
man
had
been
working
for
years
on
saturday
then
he
comes
in
and
says
“i
am
sorry,
i
joined
church
and
i
cannot
work
on
saturday
any
more.”
now,
does
he
have
some
job,
some
responsibility
of
suggesting
on
how
this
can
be
done?
unknown
speaker
but
he
joined
the
church.
unknown
speaker
he
brought
the
issue
up.
unknown
speaker
done
if
he
did
not
get
paid,
but
when
a
man
is
on
annual
salary,
it
is
a
little
different
problem.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if
suppose
a
man
who
is
being
paid
so
much
money
to
work
6
days
a
week
during
the
whole
year
and
then
he
joins
church
and
he
gets
52
days
off
with
pay,
just
like
that?
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
what
else
could
the
employer
do?
unknown
speaker
in
my
case
what
else
can
the
employer
do?
unknown
speaker
what
did
the
district
court
find
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
there
was
a
union
shop
there?
unknown
speaker
there
was
a
union
shop
in
that
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
becker,
if
this
law
is
bad,
why
would
not
a
law
be
bad
which
simply
said
that
the
employer
could
not
discriminate
on
the
grounds
of
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
let
us
talk
about
on
the
establishment
clause
grounds.
unknown
speaker
i
would
suppose
you
would
argue
that
the
statute
requires
an
employer
to
avoid
firing
a
person
or
refusing
to
hire
him
on
the
grounds
of
his
religion
and
that
the
aim
of
it,
the
purpose
of
it
surely
his
religion.
unknown
speaker
and
you
do
not
think
that
would
reach
this
case?
i
just
want
to
clear
interstate
commerce
of
religious
discrimination
which
can
be
reasonably
avoided.
unknown
speaker
well
i
have
another
example
just
like
the
scintilla
of
evidence
as
what
purpose
was
you
would
strike
it
down
just
like
you
would
this
one?
unknown
speaker
i
heard
you,
i
heard
you
the
first
time,
but
i
do
not
know
why
that
does
not
reach
you
in
this
case
too?
unknown
speaker
because
there
is
no
evidence
you
say?
