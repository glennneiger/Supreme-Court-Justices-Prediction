we
will
hear
argument
next
in
number
478,
parker
seal
company
against
cummins.
mr.
becker,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
fully
concerned
with
aiding
the
pre-exercise
or
privilege?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
becker.
mr.
hogan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
not
uniformly
true
everywhere,
these
rates
of
one-and-a-half
and
the
double?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
this
is
a
society
in
which
that
has
been
the
overwhelming
tradition
for
more
than
300
years,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
must
the
employer
accommodate
every
religion,
every
religionist,
including
those
who
have
monday,
tuesday,
wednesday
or
thursday?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
it
not
in
the
testimony
that
he
did
not
live
up
to
his
promise?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
what
will
bring
you
up
to
the
constitutional
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
hogan.
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
argument
that
it
is
to
adjust
the
functioning
of
the
plant
and
the
work
on
the
floor
with
numerous
employees.
is
it
not
all
that
easy
the
way
you
describe
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
doing
that
once
in
4
or
5
or
perhaps
more
years
is
quite
different
from
having
to
adjust
work
schedules
day
by
day
and
week
by
week,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
have
completed
your
answer
to
justice
powell,
mr.
wallace
and
your
time
is
up,
thank
you.
mr.
becker,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
also
have
the
disposition
to
announce
that
number
75-478,
parker
seal
company
versus
cummins,
and
in
that
case,
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
is
affirmed
by
an
equally
divided
court
here.
