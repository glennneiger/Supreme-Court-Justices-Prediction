mr.
leonard
h.
becker
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
6th
circuit.
at
issue
are
the
interpretation
and
validity
of
two
parallel
provisions
of
federal
law.
the
first
is
a
guideline
of
the
equal
employment
opportunities
commission,
which
was
promulgated
in
1967.
second
is
a
1972
amendment
to
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
which
adds
to
that
statute
a
definition
of
the
term
religion.
these
provisions
require
the
employer
to
accommodate
all
aspects
of
the
religious
observance
and
practice
of
his
employees,
unless
the
employer
can
demonstrate
that
to
do
so
would
work
an
undue
hardship
to
the
conduct
of
his
business.
facts
of
the
case
maybe
briefly
summarized.
the
respondent,
paul
cummins,
worked
for
a
period
of
approximately
12
years
at
the
berea,
kentucky
plant
with
the
petitioner
parker
seal
company.
he
rose
to
the
level
of
departmental
supervisor.
in
1970,
he
joined
the
world
wide
church
of
god,
which
observes
sabbath
from
friday
sundown
to
saturday
sundown.
he
there
upon
advised
his
immediate
superior
that
he
would
no
longer
be
available
for
work
on
saturdays.
he
was
not
discharged.
contrary,
he
was
granted
saturdays
off
for
over
a
year.
during
that
period
of
time,
management
directed
fellow
supervisors
to
substitute
on
cummins
behalf
on
each
and
every
saturday
that
his
department
was
scheduled
to
operate.
in
or
about
august
of
1971,
when
an
increasing
work
load
at
the
plant
had
given
rise
to
difficulties
with
this
arrangement,
cummins
was
requested
by
his
superior,
to
undertake
voluntarily,
to
approach
his
fellow
supervisors
and
on
his
own
initiative
to
offer
to
relieve
them
during
their
respective
overtime
shifts
during
the
middle
of
the
week.
cummins
did
not
do
this.
he
was
then
requested
to
reconsider
his
position
with
respect
to
saturday
work.
he
declined
to
do
so
and
he
was
discharged.
cummins
instituted
two
proceedings,
the
first,
under
kentucky
law,
before
the
commission
on
human
rights.
that
commission
applied
a
state
civil
right
statute
which
followed
the
federal
law
in
all
pertinent
respects,
including
the
accommodation
provision
which
is
at
issue
here.
after
a
full
dress
evidentiary
hearing,
the
state
commission
determined
that
the
employer,
parker
seal
had
made
a
reasonable
attempt
to
accommodate
cummins
and
dismissed
cummins’
complaint.
cummins
also
instituted
a
federal
proceeding.
first
by
filing
a
complaint
with
the
eeoc
and
then
upon
receipt
of
his
statutory
right
to
sue
letter,
a
federal
complaint
was
filed
in
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky.
cummins
agreed
that
that
court
could
decide
his
claim
on
the
basis
of
evidentiary
record
that
had
been
compiled
before
the
state
commission.
on
that
basis,
the
district
court
again
held
in
favor
of
parker
seal.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
that
judgment.
it
did
so
largely
on
the
basis
of
its
conclusion.
that
parker
seal
had
failed
to
demonstrate
why
the
accommodation
which
was
supposedly
reasonable
for
over
a
year
had
suddenly
become
unreasonable.
we
submit
that
this
judgment
was
erroneous
for
three
reasons.
the
first
reason
is
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
in
affect
penalizes
the
company
for
having
attempted
for
over
a
year
to
work
out
an
accommodation
of
cummins.
indeed
the
court
below
has
flung
that
effort
of
accommodation
in
the
face
of
the
company
as
an
admission
against
the
company’s
interest.
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
blackmun;
no
issue
as
such
is
presented
on
this
record.
a
second
reason
that
the
judgment
below
was
erroneous,
we
submit,
is
that
it
is
flatly
inconsistent
with
other
decisions.
both
of
the
sixth
circuit
and
of
other
courts
of
appeals
which
indicate
that
the
employer
stands
on
firmer
ground,
when
he
shows
he
has
made
some
attempt
to
accommodation
and
then
can
point
to
that
effort
in
support
of
his
position
that
the
effort
is
unsuccessful.
we
believe
that
that
line
of
decisions
better
comports
with
the
statutory
objective
here,
which
most
be,
one
of
voluntarism
of
efforts
on
the
part
of
both
employer
and
employee
to
arrive
at
some
mutually
acceptable
arrangement
given
the
employee’s
views.
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
i
quite
agree
and
i
would
say
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
that
is
a
point
of
great
force
for
us
on
both
statutory
and
constitutional
points
of
this
case.
recognizing
that
though
and
addressing
myself
at
this
juncture
exclusively
to
the
statutory
argument,
i
would
say
that
if
the
thrust
of
congress
is
to
achieve
an
accommodation
by
the
employer
of
the
employee’s
religious
needs,
then
that
overall
objective,
putting
the
establishment
cost
to
one
side,
that
overall
objective
is
better
satisfied
if
the
employer
can
make
an
attempt
at
accommodation
without
subjecting
himself
to
the
risk
of
what
happened
in
this
case
which
was
to
that
attempt
was
then
used
against
him
when
he
got
to
court.
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
under
the
regulation
and
under
the
statute
both,
the
courts
have
held
that
the
burden
rests
with
the
employer
to
show
the
prima
facie
issue
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
accommodation
or
the
“undo-ness”
of
the
hardship.
we
think
we
met
that
burden
here
and
we
think
we
did
so
by
demonstrating
the
unrealistic
nature
of
the
various
alternatives
which
were
proposed.
i
might
note
in
passing
in
response
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
none
of
the
alternatives
proposed
were
advanced
before
the
kentucky
commission
or
indeed
before
the
district
court.
they
seemed
to
have
risen
at
the
appellant
level.
it
is
suggested,
for
instance,
below
that
an
alternative
arrangement
might
have
been
for
mr.
cummins
to
work
on
sundays.
we
submit
this
was
unrealistic.
the
plant
rarely
has
ever
operated
on
sundays.
there
was
no
point
we
submit,
in
having
mr.
cummins
come
in
to
supervise
a
department
where
his
men
were
not
working.
another
suggestion
which
was
advanced
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
which
to
our
surprise
has
been
adopted
by
the
united
states
as
amicus
is
that
cummins’
pay
might
have
been
cut.
now,
cummins
was
not
an
hourly
employee.
he
was
paid
in
annual
salary.
he
was
required
to
work
whenever
circumstances
required.
the
plant
operated
on
what
was
known
as
a
5
plus
day
schedule.
that
is,
it
ran
mondays
to
fridays
on
a
regular
basis,
and
then
worked
over
on
saturdays
when
the
work
load
required.
we
fail
to
understand,
how
cutting
mr.
cummins’
pay
in
response
to
his
request
to
be
relieved
on
saturdays
would
on
the
respondent’s
theory
of
this
case
any
more
pass
statutory
muster
than
the
discharge
which
actually
resulted.
now,
the
third
point
i
wish
to
make
with
respect
to
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
why
we
submitted
that
judgment
was
erroneous
is
this.
we
think
that
the
overall
approach
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
erroneous.
it
assumed
that
the
initial
arrangement
was
satisfactory.
on
the
record
that
was
not
so.
it
is
clear
that
other
supervisors
were
forced
to
work
overtime
on
account
of
cummins’
religion.
they
received
no
extra
compensations
for
their
efforts.
moreover,
to
the
extent
that
supervisory
personnel
were
forced
to
split
their
time
on
saturday
mornings
as
between
the
department
from
which
cummins
was
absent
and
the
department
which
his
fellow
supervisors
were
required
to
operate,
there
was
a
necessary
doubling
up.
the
plant
manager
testified
at
the
hearing
that
that
was
absolutely
not
a
satisfactory
operating
procedure.
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
well,
i
would
assume,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
this
court
would
not
wish
to
be
put
in
the
position
of
second
guessing
facts.
the
difficulty
we
have
here
is
the
court
of
appeals
itself
has
put
itself
on
the
posture
of
second
guessing
facts
and
we
have
a
question
on
the
ongoing
administration
of
the
act
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
should
subject
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
district
court.
we
agree
that
the
test
under
the
statute
is
one
of
reasonableness.
in
essence,
the
question
whether
the
employer
has
acted
reasonably
under
all
of
the
circumstances
and
so
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned,
putting
aside
the
constitutional
question,
that
is
a
factual
issue
which
we
agree
must
be
decided
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
the
problem
here
is
two
fold.
first,
the
court
of
appeals
has
injected
an
undue
improper
consideration
into
the
case.
it
has
escalated
one
element
to
the
case
to
a
dispositive
level
and
that
element
is
the
fact
that
this
employer
made
an
attempt
to
accommodate
and
decided
after
a
year
that
it
did
not
work.
now,
that
we
think
presents
a
question
of
law
which
is
appropriately
submitted
to
this
court
for
its
review.
the
second
problem
we
have
with
the
manner
of
which
the
court
of
appeals
disposed
of
this
case
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
itself
put
itself
in
the
position
of
revealing
the
record
de
novo.
despite
the
protestations
of
the
majority
opinion
we
submit
that
the
courts
below
essentially
retried
the
case
and
we
think
that
is
an
improper
way
for
courts
of
appeals
to
proceed
in
cases
of
this
sort.
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
that
is
correct.
the
district
court
had
before
it,
the
evidentiary
record
that
was
compiled
before
the
kentucky
commission
and
the
district
court
also
had
before
it
cummins’
agreement
that
the
case
could
be
disposed
off
on
that
record.
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
i
agree
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
district
court
did
not
have
the
demeanor
with
the
witnesses
before.
it
did
have
the
record
that
was
compiled
before
the
kentucky
commission
which
consisted
of
a
panel
of
several
members
who
did
have
the
benefit
of
such
demeanor
and
who
did
observe
the
witnesses
as
they
appeared
before
that
commission.
now,
in
explaining
why
we
think
the
decision
below
is
incorrect,
i
wish
to
revert
one
last
time
to
the
point
that
we
have
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
improperly
elevated
one
factor,
which
is
the
effort
of
this
employer
to
accommodate.
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
erroneously
concluded
that
that
effort
at
accommodation
was
reasonable
at
the
outset.
we
think
it
was
an
extension
of
activity
in
the
part
of
the
employer
that
went
far
beyond
a
satisfactory
arrangement
so
far
as
that
employer
was
concerned.
moreover,
the
court
of
appeals
we
think
erred
when
it
concluded
that
parker
seals
failed
to
show
why
that
arrangement
suddenly
became
unreasonable.
we
think
the
reason
it
became
unreasonable
is
perfectly
clear
on
this
record.
as
i
indicated
at
the
outset,
the
problem
was
that
cummins
was
failing
on
his
own
initiative
to
volunteer
to
assist
his
fellow
supervisors.
the
fact
is
that
at
the
outset
of
this
arrangement
in
july
of
1970,
cummins
expressed
great
willingness
to
be
cooperative
and
to
assist
wherever
assistance
was
asked
for.
but
his
attitude
changed
and
by
the
time
he
was
discharged,
it
is
clear
from
the
testimony
of
his
fellow
supervisors
and
of
his
plant
managers
that
he
had
not
fulfilled
his
share
of
the
bargain.
we
think
it
merits
emphasis
on
this
case
that
this
is
not
a
case
of
discrimination.
indeed,
there
was
never
any
suggestion
at
any
level
of
these
procedures
that
this
company
had
intentionally
discriminated
against
cummins
because
of
his
religion.
the
facts
of
the
case
belie
any
such
suggestion.
the
accommodation
that
was
extended
cummins
for
over
a
year
shows
that
this
company
bent
over
backwards
to
avoid
discriminating
against
him
because
of
his
religion.
the
question
here
is
very
different.
it
is
on
the
statutory
level,
whether
a
company
has
satisfactorily
performed
a
very
different
obligation
which
is
to
accommodate
an
employee
on
account
of
his
religious
needs.
now,
in
underscoring
the
difference,
i
wish
to
point
out
that
it
is
virtually
conceded
here
by
parties
that
if
this
case
did
arise
under
the
basic
anti-discrimination
provision
of
title
vii,
parker
seal
would
be
home
free.
i
think
it
is
abundantly
clear,
for
example
that
this
company
complied
with
the
requirements
which
were
laid
down
in
the
griggs
decision.
if
i
may
quote
just
a
moment
from
that
opinion,
the
court
there
said
that
discriminatory
preference
for
any
group,
minority
or
majority
is
precisely
and
only
what
congress
has
prescribed.
now,
the
impact
of
this
particular
statutory
provision
is
to
require
a
preference
which
i
submit,
worked
a
discriminatory
effect,
not
against
cummins,
who
benefited
from
the
arrangement
for
over
a
year,
but
against
the
fellow
supervisors
who
were
required
to
come
in,
substitute
for
cummins
on
each
and
every
saturday
that
his
department
was
operating.
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
this
is
part
of
my
statutory
argument
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
i
am
stressing
the
difference
between
the
basic
anti-discrimination
provision
of
title
vii,
with
which
this
court
has
previously
dealt
and
the
very
different
accommodation
provision
which
the
definitional
section
added
in
1972
and
the
eeoc
guideline
required.
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
that
is
a
point
which
i
will
address
and
develop
on
my
constitutional
argument.
you
are
of
course
absolutely
right,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
i
am
merely
explaining.
all
i
intend
to
do
by
this
argument
at
this
level
is
to
explain
the
difference
which
we
see
between
a
discrimination
case
and
a
case
arising
out
of
this
statute.
i
am
pointing
to
the
fact
that
had
this
case
arisen
on
to
the
basic
provision
of
title
vii,
this
employer
would
surely
have
been
free
of
liability
and
i
am
merely
explaining
the
added
burden
which
this
statute
proposes
on
the
employer,
the
burden,
which
i
hasten
to
add
that
i
think
we
met
and
we
met
it
by
relieving
this
fellow
with
his
obligations
for
over
a
year.
now
in
that
regard,
we
have
developed
in
our
main
brief,
a
list
of
the
factors
which
we
think
will
be
pertinent
on
the
statutory
level
in
assessing
the
reasonableness
of
an
employer’s
effort
to
accommodate
on
case
by
case
basis.
we
think
this
case
is
an
appropriate
vehicle
for
the
court
to
consider
some
of
those
factors
and
perhaps
to
advise
the
lower
courts
whose
opinions
are
in
some
disarray
on
the
subject,
what
factors
may
and
may
not
properly
considered.
one
factor
as
i
previously
indicated
which
we
think
should
not
be
accorded
to
dispositive
significance
is
the
suggestion
that
because
the
employer
has
made
an
effort
at
accommodating
the
employee,
he
is
somehow
subject
to
a
heightened
obligation
to
explain
why
the
accommodation
is
no
longer
possible.
let
me
turn
now
if
i
may,
to
the
constitutional
side
of
our
case.
in
the
event
that
the
statutory
question
is
resolved
adversely
to
us,
we
challenge
the
federal
constitutionality
of
both
the
guideline
and
the
statutory
amendment.
we
say
that
those
provisions
in
tandem
violate
the
establishment
cause
of
the
first
amendment.
now,
the
court
is
fully
familiar
with
the
three-part
test
or
guideline
which
is
developed
in
the
context
of
the
various
school
paid
cases
which
have
been
before
it
over
the
years.
those
principles
are
discussed
in
full
in
our
briefs
and
i
shall
not
labor
them
here.
i
wish
to
make
on
following
few
points.
first,
this
statute
undoubtedly,
indisputably
aids
religion.
that
is
its
whole
point
and
purpose.
senator
randolph
said
so,
when
he
introduced
it
on
the
floor
of
the
senate.
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
guideline
itself
makes
it
clear
that
that
is
all
that
the
statute
and
guideline
are
concerned
with.
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
it
is
an
attempt
by
congress
to
force
the
employer
to
make
accommodations
or
to
permit
the
employee
to
engage
in
one
kind
of
activity,
which
is
religious
activity.
i
do
not,
in
any
sense,
mr.
chief
justice
denigrate
the
motives
of
congress
in
passing
the
statute.
it
is
clear
that
its
instinct
was
highest
purity.
the
objective
was
to
assist
in
the
ability
of
certain
employees
to
enjoy
their
religious
activities.
now,
i
note
that
immediately
the
question
is
presented
onto
the
establishment
clause
because
of
the
narrow
focus
of
the
statute.
it
is
devoted
solely
to
the
assistance
of
religionists.
moreover,
we
submit
that
the
statute
is
devoted
solely
to
the
assistance
of
certain
religionists,
namely,
those
who
wish
to
observe
their
sabbath
on
a
saturday.
that
was
the
precise
purpose
to
which
senator
randolph
said
when
he
was
introducing
this
legislation.
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
that
is
correct
under
the
statute.
that
is
quite
right.
the
statute
reaches
all
aspects
of
observance
and
practice
of
religion,
but
i
know
that
the
guideline
which
antedated
the
statute
is
called,
quote
“observance
of
sabbath
and
other
religious
holidays.”
the
introductory
section
of
that
guideline
says
that
several
complaints
filed
with
the
commission
have
raised
a
question
concerning
employees
who
regularly
observe
friday
evening
and
saturday
or
some
other
day
of
the
week,
as
the
sabbath.
the
guideline
was
directed
to
the
problem
of
the
saturday
observing
religionist
and
that
means
it
was
directed
to
one
particular
subgroup
of
religious
practitioners.
we
submit
that
that
further
points
to
the
constitutional
impropriety
of
this
legislation.
now,
i
want
to
stress
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
sherbert
v.
verner
decision
of
this
court.
that
was
the
case
in
which
the
court
dealt
with
the
seventh
day
adventist
who
was
deprived
of
unemployment
compensation
benefits
under
a
south
carolina
statutory
scheme
which
denied
benefits
to
those
who
are
unavailable
for
work.
now,
the
argument
that
has
been
developed
on
the
other
side
of
this
case
is
that
as
part
of
a
statutory
scheme
that
deals
with
discrimination,
title
vii,
the
congress
could
pick
up
the
notion
of
discrimination
that
was
developed
in
sherbert
and
simply
apply
that
pari
pasu
to
private
people.
we
think
that
argument
is
wrong.
the
first
point
is
that
sherbert
was
not
a
case
of
discrimination.
the
appellant
in
that
case
presented
in
a
claim
of
denial
of
equal
protection,
which
was
not
passed
upon.
what
was
presented
there
was
the
problem
arising
from
the
state’s
even
handed
application
of
officially
neutral
unemployment
compensation
scheme
which
resulted
in
governmental
pressure
on
the
appellant
because
of
her
religion
and
that
introduced
an
improper
infringement
on
her
free
exercise.
that
i
submit
is
very
different
itself
from
a
discrimination
case.
now,
there
is
another
point
on
which
sherbert
precedent
is
different.
in
that
case
the
court
noted
that
a
separate
state
statute
expressly
saved
out
the
sunday
worshipper.
state
laws
then
linked
together,
clearly
separated
the
saturday
from
the
sunday
observing
worshipper.
that
is
not
true
here.
parker
seal
on
rare
occasions
operated
its
plant
as
on
sunday
and
one
of
the
witnesses
at
the
hearing,
web,
testified
that
as
a
supervisor,
he
was
on
occasion
required
to
come
in
on
sundays
even
though
to
do
so
violated
his
religion.
it
is
clear
then
that
this
company
did
not
discriminate
between
saturday
and
sunday
observers
as
did
the
south
carolina
statutory
scheme
considered
as
a
whole,
in
sherbert.
now,
both
the
sherbert
precedent
and
the
other
precedents
which
were
relied
upon
by
the
respondent
go
to
the
notion
that
where
the
government
infringes
or
is
about
to
infringe
upon
the
free
exercise
rights
of
citizens
then
relief
may
and
in
some
cases,
must
be
in
order,
even
though
the
result
might
abstractly
be
deemed
to
give
rise
to
some
establishment
question.
to
rephrase
the
proposition,
an
establishment
clause
objection
will
be
overridden
where
in
order
to
satisfy
it,
the
government
will
be
required
to
infringe
upon
a
free
exercise
rights
of
the
affected
persons.
this
court’s
decision
in
the
yoder
case,
the
amish
school
children
case,
is
a
conspicuous
illustration
of
that
proposition.
this
is
not
that
case.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
government
is
saying
to
one
private
person,
“you
have
got
to
change
the
way
you
do
business
in
order
that
another
private
person
may
enjoy
his
religious
rights.”
now,
once
again
the
purpose
maybe
thoroughly
understandable,
but
the
problem
is
that
it
amounts
to
something
which
goes
to
the
core
of
the
establishment
clause.
it
is
governmental
pressure
coercion
being
leveled
against
one
person
on
account
on
another
person’s
religion.
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
well
those
cases
present
their
own
difficulties.
candidly,
i
am
not
sure
that
they
can
be
easily
reconciled
with
the
yoder
decision,
but
they
certainly
rested
themselves
on
the
proposition
that
in
overriding
non-sectarian
secular
purpose
had
motivated
the
state
legislatures.
the
interest
in
gendering
a
uniform
day
of
rest
and
the
court
said
although
those
statutes
may
once
have
had
their
origins
in
religious
notions,
those
religious
notions
had
eviscerated
and
there
was
now
a
secular
purpose
which
overrode
the
objection
of
the
orthodox
jew
who
was
forced
to
choose
between
his
religion
and
his
livelihood.
that
is
not
this
case.
there
is
no
nonsectarian
purpose
to
this
statute.
the
statute
on
its
face
is
directed
to
the
protection
and
enhancement
of
certain
religious
groups
and
indeed
the
language
of
senator
randolph
makes
it
clear
that
he
was
sponsoring
it
because
saturday
observing
groups,
of
which
he
was
a
member,
were
having
difficulty
in
keeping
up
their
congregations
because
some
of
the
members
had
to
work
on
saturdays.
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
it
certainly
is
cannot
be
imputed
to
the
law,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
however,
it
makes
up
virtually
all
of
the
legislative
history
on
this
statute.
now,
the
court
has
indicated
that
one
branch
of
the
three-part
test
under
the
establishment
clause
will
be
to
consider
the
purpose
of
the
legislature
in
enacting
the
challenged
statute.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
appropriate,
assuming
that
the
purpose
branch
is
different
from
the
primary
affect
branch
to
look
at
what
the
legislature
said
when
enacting
the
statute.
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
i
agree
with
that
completely
of
course,
but
if
we
look
to
the
words
of
both
the
guideline
and
the
statute,
there
again
the
problem
is
presented.
the
primary
effect
of
this
statutory
scheme
is
to
enhance
religious
activity.
that
is
its
whole
point
and
purpose
and
if
we
divined
the
purpose
of
legislature
from
the
necessary
effect
of
the
statutory
words
we
reach
the
same
result.
i
reserve
the
balance.
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
if
it
pleases
the
court,
unless
there
are
questions
by
the
court,
i
have
nothing
to
add
to
my
prior
statement.
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
there
i
think
once
again
mr.
justice
rehnquist
we
would
be
in
the
posture
that
the
government
in
order
to
avoid
an
infringement
upon
free
exercise,
would
have
to
make
allowances,
but
that
is
because
it
is
the
government,
which
is
the
employer
in
that
case
and
i
believe
the
civil
service
has
adapted…
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
well,
there
are
several
points
to
be
made
in
response.
first
is
that
the
company
does
have
a
right
to
challenge
the
statute
under
the
establishment
clause.
of
course,
the
company
does
not
have
an
independent
free
exercise
claim
nor
are
we
here
today
asserting
on
behalf
of
some
third
person
any
free
exercise
claim,
but
the
company
is
coerced
by
government
to
undertake
activity
with
respect
to
and
in
favoritism
of
a
private
person’s
religious
activities
and
that
gives
raise
to
an
establishment
clause
objection
here.
the
second
point
is
that
the
government
is
a
much
larger
employer
than
the
berea
kentucky
plant
of
parker
seal
and
to
the
extent
that
we
deal
on
a
statutory
plain
at
least
each
of
these
cases
must
turn
on
the
number
of
fundable
employees
who
may
possibly
be
substituted
for
one
another.
that
is
not
a
possibility
here
where
we
dealt
with
a
limited
number
of
supervisory
personnel.
on
the
constitutional
plain,
i
adhere
to
my
answer
that
the
government
must
make
allowances
as
it
did
in
the
conscientious
objector
cases
where
a
failure
to
make
such
allowance
would
give
rise
to
a
substantial
problem
under
the
free
exercise
clause.
this
was
the
point
with
mr.
justice
white
made
in
his
dissent
in
the
welsh
case.
it
is
the
essence
of
the
yoder
decision
of
this
court.
there
is
difference
when
the
government
is
the
employer.
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
yes
mr.
justice
powell
there
are
cases
which
i
believe
are
now
pending
in
this
court
on
certiorari
which
involve
questions
arising
in
such
circumstances.
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
twa
case
does,
the
question
is
reserved,
i
hesitate
for
this
reason
mr.
justice
powell,
the
question
is
specifically
reserved
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
twa,
although
you
have
before
the
court
a
petition
from
the
union,
which
says
that
the
question
cannot
possibly
be
reserved
because
in
order
to
carry
out
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals
it
would
be
necessary
to
alter
the
seniority
agreement
which
the
company
has
with
the
union.
in
twa,
if
a
fellow
transfers
from
a
night
shift
to
a
day
shift,
he
looses
seniority
as
a
result,
is
forced
to
take
on
saturday
work
and
objects
and
question
presented
there
is
whether
the
union
can
be
required
to
modify
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
order
to
accommodate
this
employee.
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
well
in
yacht,
i
believe
the
case
is
returned
to
the
district
court,
if
i
recall
it
correctly
to
consider
whether
it
is
possible
that
an
employee
who
declines
his
union
dues
can
nonetheless
somehow
or
rather
be
accommodated.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
did
not
have
any
idea
on
how
this
fellow
might
be
accommodated,
but
sent
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
to
see
if
they
could
figure
out
a
way.
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
i
am
sorry?
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
yes,
that
is
correct.
there
is
a
similar,
a
recent
decision
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
cooper
against
general
dynamics,
where
a
similar
problem
is
presented.
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
there
i
think
congress
can
justifiably
purge
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce
of
an
obstruction.
same
reasoning
that
applied
on
griggs
would
seem
to
me
to
carry
forward
there.
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
well
i
think—
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
no,
i
would
not
say
it
was.
i
would
say
is
for
a
different
purpose.
there
is
an
overriding
secular
purpose
in
a
statute
which
seeks
to
purge
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce
of
irrational
acts
of
employment
which
tend
to
cut
out
of
the
job
market
certain
people
on
the
basis
of
irrational
and
irrelevant
considerations.
that
is
at
the
heart
of
the
griggs
decision.
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
there
is
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
the
record
here
or
before
congress
that
congress
had
that
purpose
in
mind.
now,
if
congress
came
back
with
the
statute
which
said,
“we
have
conducted
hearings
and
we
have
found
that
there
is
pervasive…”
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
no,
i
do
not
believe
i
would.
i
would
say
that
a
statute
which
seeks
to
purge
channels
of
interstate
commerce
of
discriminatory
commerce…
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
because
there
is
no—
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
no,
and
also
because
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
makes
it
clear
that
congress
was
not
concerned
about
discrimination
here.
it
was
not
concerned
that
it
needed
tighten
up
or
toughen
up
the
basic
antidiscrimination
provision
of
title
vii,
because
it
had
uncovered
a
weakness
in
the
original
statute.
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
to
help
certain
people
out
precisely
and
solely
because
of
their
particular
religious
circumstances.
mr.
leonard
h.
becker
well,
there
is
no
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
that
congress
was
inspired
by
the
1967
guideline.
problem
was
that
the
guideline
itself
had
been
challenged
repeatedly
in
the
courts
as
not
properly
promulgated
under
the
original
statute.
