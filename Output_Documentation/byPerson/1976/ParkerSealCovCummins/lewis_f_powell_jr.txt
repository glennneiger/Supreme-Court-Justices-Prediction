justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
wallace
in
this
case
however,
we
are
dealing
with
a
statute
providing
for
equal
employment
and
the
cases
we
usually
have
of
course
involve
alleged
discrimination
with
respect
to
pay
or
promotions.
now,
the
petitioner
here
has
not
discriminated
against
mr.
cummins.
what
the
petitioner
wants
is
not
equal
treatment?
he
wants
preferred
treatment
and
it
is
a
little
curious
to
find
provision
of
the
statute
that
701,
that
uses
term
discrimination
in
a
context
that
results
in
the
argument
being
made
here
that
because
the
employer
--
the
equal
treatment
to
mr.
cummins.
the
company,
that
employer,
is
charged
with
discriminatory
practice.
the
question
i
lead
up
to
ask
is
whether
or
not
in
connection
with
your
constitutional
argument,
the
employer
is
really
not
being
compelled
by
law
to
accord
a
privilege,
a
benefit
to
an
employee
because
of
his
religious
choice
or
beliefs.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
becker,
have
any
of
the
cases
in
this
area
involve
situations
where
the
accommodation
required
a
violation
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
or
in
the
circuit
which
raise
the
question,
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
involved
in
the
case
directly.
has
there
been
a
spare
holding
anywhere?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
i
think
that
in
the
yacht
against
the
north
american
rockwell
company.
