justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
voluntarism
mr.
becker,
there
is
really
nothing
voluntary
about
what
the
employer
is
doing.
he
is
being
required
to
do
it
by
an
act
of
congress.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
not
think
this
court
would
be
apt
to
take
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
of
a
kind
of
ad
hoc
factual
basis
in
an
individual
case
where
the
test
is
reasonably
accommodate
rather
than
to
second
guess
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
facts
of
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
submitted
on
a
written
record
though
to
the
district
court,
was
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
do
not
have
in
this
case
than
any
question
of
the
tried,
the
federal
district
judge’s
evaluation
of
credibility
of
oral
testimony?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
is
this
a
statutory
argument
you
are
making
or
constitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
just
because
they
are
different,
does
that
not
suggest
that
there
is
going
to
be
an
element
of
discrimination
against
the
people
who
observe
the
sabbath
on
the
sunday
and
that
type
of
people
who
practice
the
religion
of
the
majority?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
it
does
not
seem
to
me
to
help
your
statutory
argument
very
much?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
statutory
language
is
certainly
broader.
i
mean,
supposing
you
get
somebody
who
does
not
want
to
eat
meat
on
friday,
you
will
have
some
sort
of
an
argument
that
maybe
a
fish
ought
to
be
served
in
a
cafeteria
on
friday,
would
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
do
with
cases
like
mcgowan
against
maryland
and
that
group
that
holds
sunday
closing
lawns?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
senator
randolph’s
comment,
i
do
not
think
can
be
attributed
to
all
the
other
99
senators
and
however
many
members
of
congress
that
is
who
voted
on
that
day?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
the
legislature
said
is
contained
in
the
law
that
it
passed
sometimes
in
the
committee
report.
it
certainly
is
not
contained
in
the
comments
of
one
member
of
the
legislature?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
griggs
was
dealing
with
employment
tests,
was
not
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
case
would
be
more
difficult,
would
it
not
mr.
wallace,
if
you
did
not
have
the
1972
amendment?
are
you
not
better
off
to
argue
on
the
statute
from
the
1972
amendment,
rather
than
trying
to
argue
something
that
does
not
help
you…
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
civil
service
commission
had
adapted
precisely
this
sort
of
a
regulation
to
be
applicable
to
the
government
agencies?
would
you
say
that
violated
the
establishment
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
client
has
certainly
has
no
establishment
clause
or
free
exercise
clause.
it
is
a
corporation.
all
it
can
do
is
raise
the
free
exercise
claims
of
the
other
employees
and
i
would
think
the
other
government
employees
would
have
just
the
same
claim
as
the
other
employees
of
parker
seal
do,
if
the
civil
service
commission
made
that
regulation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you
explain
the
eeoc
guideline
of
1967,
which
was
promulgated
under
the
basic
statute
and
then
congress
although
adapted,
that
sounds
like
evolution
rather
than
a
brand
new
thought
coming
into
congress’s
mind?
