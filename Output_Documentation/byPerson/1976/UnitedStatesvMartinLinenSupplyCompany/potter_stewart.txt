justice
potter
stewart
you
told
us
that
the
federal
rules
have
abolished
the
directed
verdict
of
acquittal,
but
up
until
recently
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
and
had
the
district
judge
done
that
when
the
jury
reported
they
were
deadlocked
had
he
then
on
motion
or
without
motion
said
well,
i
have
considered
all
the
evidence
and
i
hereby
direct
you
to
reach
the
verdict
of
acquittal,
that
functionally
would
be
precisely
the
same
as
this
case,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
case
first,
and
then
you
would
involve
in
any
or
all
of
the
hypothetical
as
you
want.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
this
is
after
the
jury
comes
back
and
says
we
are
deadlocked,
we
can
not
reach
a
verdict
and
the
judge
says,
well,
that
was
nearly
a
motion
of
acquittal
and
i
had
it
under
consideration
and
i
now
direct
you
to
reach
a
verdict
of
acquittal.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
even
if
he
does
not,
generally
he
used
an
open
court.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
directed
jury
verdict
of
acquittal,
why
is
not
that
a
fong
foo
case?
justice
potter
stewart
hypothesis
is
that
the
jury
does
not
agree
and
the
judge
at
that
point
says,
well
i
am
going
to
direct
you
to
enter
a
verdict
of
acquittal.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
i
thought,
even
though
it
is
an
instructive
verdict
of
acquittal.
justice
potter
stewart
right,
but
what
did
the
defendant
do
here?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
my
case,
would
it
normally
be
the
defense
counsel
make
such
a
motion
at
the
end
of
the
criminal
trial,
does
he
usually
do
this?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
you
we
ask
for
judgment
of
acquittal,
he
can
be
retried.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
is
not
that
complaining
about
anything
he
has
been
deprived
of?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
the
defendant
asked
for
a
verdict
of
acquittal
from
a
very
moment
he
pleads
not
guilty,
does
he
not?
that
is
continuing
request
and
that
is
continuous
throughout
the
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
ask
to
be
acquitted.
