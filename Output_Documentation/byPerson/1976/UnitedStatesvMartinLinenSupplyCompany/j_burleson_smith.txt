mr.
j.
burleson
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
a
narrow
and
a
limited
constitutional
question
involved
here
and
i
confess
to
the
court
that
much
has
been
written
about
the
problem
of
double
jeopardy
both
before
and
after
the
1970
amendment.
i
will
not
suggest
to
the
court
that
everything
has
been
written
and
the
area
is
consistent,
nor
will
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
single
case
handled
by
this
court
in
which
there
has
been
a
dispositive
ruling,
a
ruling
on
facts
on
all
squares
with
ours.
i
do
suggest,
however,
that
the
precedent
and
the
policy
of
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
both
support
the
affirmance
of
the
judgments
below.
turning
first
to
the
question,
then
of
course
the
fountainhead
of
all
decisions
and
all
considerations
in
a
case
like
this
is
mr.
justice
story’s
opinion
in
the
perez
case
in
1824.
that
case
ordinarily
is
cited
for
his
words
about
the
prisoner
has
been
neither
convicted
nor
acquitted
then
therefore
maybe
put
to
his
defense.
similarly
the
words
manifest
necessity,
the
words
of
ends
of
public
justice,
but
i
come
after
those
words
to
the
words
that
i
think
are
really,
now
this
is
back
in
1824
are
really
those
that
are
applicable
here
after
talking
about
the
discretion
to
be
exercised
by
the
trial
judge
and
you
remember
that
perez
was
a
hung
jury
case
and
the
question
was
it
capital
case
and
the
question
was
what
was
the
trial
judge’s
power
at
that
time.
mr.
justice
story
said,
“but
after
all
they,
the
judges,
have
the
right
to
order
the
discharge
and
the
security
which
the
public
have
for
the
faithful,
sound
and
conscious
exercise
of
this
discretion
rests
in
this
as
in
other
cases
upon
the
responsibility
of
the
judges
under
their
oaths
of
office.
now,
that
it
seems
to
me
as
what
we
have
today
is
to
determine
what
the
trial
judge’s
function
is
in
a
case
and
how
he
exercised
that
function
in
this
case.
the
perez
case
of
course
has
been
cited
down
through
1976
by
this
court.
perhaps
one
of
the
most
pertinent
observations
about
it
was
in
this
court
in
wade
v.
turner
where
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
value
of
the
perez
principles
thus
lies
in
the
capacity
for
informed
application
under
widely
different
circumstances
without
injury
to
defendant
or
to
the
public
interest.
that
after
all
is
the
resolution
at
least
remains
in
this
or
in
any
other
case
involving
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
the
resolution
of
the
problems,
the
public
interest
on
the
one
hand,
the
private
interest
of
the
individual
on
the
other
hand.
but
counsel
for
the
government
says
that
only
the
jury
can
determine
facts,
that
is
thought
were
mr.
hayrlin
said
for
this
court
in
sisson
case.
that
court
in
sisson
case
for
its
decision
on
appealability
as
you
know
much
has
written
about
that
by
mr.
hayrlin,
but
this
court
said
then
in
sisson
case
that
judges
like
juries
can
acquit
defendants
and
cited
specifically
rule
29
of
the
federal
rules
of
the
criminal
procedure.
then
in
illinois
against
somerville,
this
court
recently
speaking
through
mr.
justice
rehnquist
for
the
majority,
mr.
justice
white
for
dissent,
both
acknowledge
the
applicability
of
the
perez
rule,
both
acknowledge
the
flexibility
of
the
rule
of
perez
that
there
is
no
fixed
mechanical
formula,
but
rather
that
broad
discretion
is
reserved
to
the
trial
judge.
now
that
is
what
rule
29
(c)
actually
does.
it
gives
broad
discretion
to
the
trial
judge
and
the
judge
here
exercised
that
discretion.
similarly
in
other
cases,
rule
29
cases,
the
trial
judge
has
exercised
that
discussion
similarly,
particularly
the
suarez
case
out
of
the
second
circuit
which
relied
on
the
second
circuit’s
own
opinion
in
the
jenkins
case
which
was
later
affirmed
by
this
case.
suarez
is
on
all
fours.
it
is
a
white
horse
case
in
so
far
as
the
procedural
posture
of
the
case
is
concerned.
it
was
a
multi
count
indictment.
some
of
the
counts
were
dismissed
by
the
court.
it
went
to
the
jury.
the
jury
hung
up.
the
trial
court
granted
a
rule
29
(c)
motion.
he
entered
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
the
second
circuit
said
that
the
entry
of
that
specifically
under
rule
29
(c)
barred
appeal
by
the
government,
that
there
had
been
final
determination
that
is
what
this
circuit
said
in
this
case,
that
is
what
this
case
is
all
about.
then
in
robins
out
of
the
sixth
circuit,
a
rule
29
(a)
case,
that
had
cert
denied
for
this
court.
the
court
there
as
one
of
the
your
honors
suggested
granted
a
motion
for
acquittal
at
the
end
of
the
government’s
case,
he
took
it
away
from
the
jury
at
that
juncture.
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
jeopardy
had
attached
and
that
at
appeal
by
the
government
was
barred
by
the
constitution
(inaudible)against
double
jeopardy,
and
that
came
to
this
court,
petition
was
denied.
i
suggest,
if
the
court
please,
that
there
is
no
difference
between
a
rule
29
(a)
acquittal
and
rule
29
(c)
acquittal.
so
what
we
have
are
three
circuit
courts;
the
second,
the
fifth
and
the
sixth
who
have
reached
decisions
under
the
rule
29.
now,
counsel
for
the
government
neither
in
brief
nor
in
an
oral
argument
has
cited
a
single
case
from
the
circuit
or
any
other
court
on
a
rule
29
situation
that
supports
the
government’s
position
here.
the
government’s
position
here
is
also
baseless
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
full
form.
in
full
form
which
is
then
reiterated
in
recent
opinions
of
this
court.
you
had
a
trial
judge
take
it
away
during
the
course
of
the
trial
and
enter
a
judgment.
on
the
facts
as
they
were
deuced
and
this
court
held
that
there
was
no
right
of
appeal
by
the
government.
i
reiterate
that
neither
in
oral
argument
nor
in
brief
has
the
government
supported
a
single
rule
29
case
in
its
support,
but
now
you
come,
you
cannot
get
into
the
precedent
in
this
matter
without
getting
into
famous
trilogy
of
wilson,
jenkins
and
serfass.
your
honors
of
course
know
much
more
about
those
cases
than
i
would
presume
to
know.
wilson
was
appealable
because
there
was,
as
the
court
said,
there
was
a
guilty
verdict
entered
by
the
jury.
mr.
j.
burleson
smith
your
honor,
i
am
not
going
to
suggest
that.
one
of
the
cases
recently
says
that
there
is
talismanic
quality
in
the
word
acquittal
and…
mr.
j.
burleson
smith
i
am
not
saying
that
rule
29
arises
to
constitutional
level
if
the
court
please.
mr.
j.
burleson
smith
where
there
is
a
jury
verdict
of
guilty…?
mr.
j.
burleson
smith
i
think
it
could.
mr.
j.
burleson
smith
it
is
reinstated.
there
is
no
necessity
for
a
new
trial
and
as
justice
rehnquist
said
in
the
jenkins
case,
there
is
no
necessity
for
a
new
trial
for
the
resolution
of
any..
mr.
j.
burleson
smith
and
i
think
that
we
have
taken
the
position
and
i
think
it
is
perfectly
supportable
that
jenkins
is
a
controlling
case
and
i
particularly
direct
your
honor’s
attention
to
footnote
7
in
that
case
where
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
if
you
will
remember
had
before
the
dissenting
opinion
or
the
dissenting
position
taken
by
judge
lombard
out
of
the
second
circuit.
judge
lombard
was
relying
on
such
cases
as
illinois
versus
somerville
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
said
judge
lombard
analogized
respondent’s
case
to
mistrial
cases
in
which
the
public
interest
and
fair
trial
designed
to
end
in
judgments
must
be
waived.
that
if
it
is,
we
felt,
would
not
be
serve
or
permitting
a
clearly
guilty
defendant
to
go
free
because
of
erroneous
interpretation
of
the
controlling
law.
speaking
for
this
court
mr.
justice
rehnquist
said,
we
disagree
with
this
analysis
because
we
think
it
is
of
critical
importance
whether
the
proceedings
of
the
trial
court
terminated
in
a
mistrial
as
they
did
in
the
somerville
line
of
cases
or
ended
in
defendant’s
favor
as
they
did
here.
in
other
words,
there
was
a
judgment
of
acquittal
in
favor
of
the
defendant
and
of
course
that
is
the
same
case
in
which
speaking
for
this
court
very
recently,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
also
said
and
this
gets
to
the
heart
of
the
double
jeopardy
question.
here
there
was
a
judgment
discharging
the
defendant
although
we
cannot
say
with
assurance
whether
it
was
or
was
not
a
resolution
of
the
factual
issues
against
the
government,
but
it
is
enough
for
purposes
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
and
therefore
for
the
determination
of
appealability
under
3731,
that
further
proceedings
of
some
sort
devoted
to
the
resolution
of
factual
issues
going
to
the
elements
of
the
offense
charged
would
have
been
required
upon
reversal
and
remand,
and
ironic
part
of
this
case
is
that
this
is
a
criminal
contempt
case.
criminal
contempt,
any
contempt
of
course
is
a
charge
of
flaunting
or
denigrating
the
power,
authority
and
dignity
of
a
court.
here
the
court
against
whom
the
contempt
was
supposed
to
have
been
directed
has
failed
absolutely
and
in
unequivocal
language
that
the
defendants
are
not
guilty,
that
the
government
has
failed
to
discharge
its
burden,
the
defendants
are
not
guilty,
using
those
words
if
you
please
mr.
justice
stewart
and
that
they
should
for
that
reason
be
acquitted
and
they
were
acquitted.
now,
serfass;
serfass
is
simply
a
pretrial
dismissal
and
as
the
chief
justice
suggested
that
really
is
a
test
of
this
sufficiency
of
the
indictment.
so
also
is
sanford.
sanford
is
clearly
just
as
this
court
held
in
december
of
this
last
year
is
simply
a
pretrial
dismissal.
admittedly,
the
trial
court
said
that
the
government
has
consented,
and
therefore,
whatever
the
proof
was
by
the
government,
the
defendants
should
have
been
discharged.
that
did
not
come
into
the
trial
where
that
evidence
was
introduced
and
produced.
that
trial
was
long
gone.
no
rule
29
motion
appears
in
the
reports.
that
trial
was
over,
but
as
an
after
thought
and
before
the
next
trial
the
yet
to
come
trial,
the
defendant
filed
a
motion
for
dismissal
on
the
ground
that
is
a
government’s
evidence
and
now
completed
trial
constituted
a
complete
bar.
this
court
quite
properly
held
that
that
was
nothing
but
a
pretrial
dismissal.
now,
if
the
court
please,
the
authorities,
it
seems
to
me
the
precedent
is
clearly
in
support
of
the
position
of
the
respondents
here,
the
two
corporations,
but
there
is
a
very,
very
important
consideration,
a
policy
consideration
if
the
court
please,
and
that
relates
to
the
fair
accommodation
between
the
proper
administration
of
criminal
justice
on
the
public’s
behalf
and
an
individual
defendant’s
right
to
finality
of
judgment.
i
think
this
is
what
mr.
justice
black
was
talking
about
in
green
v.
united
states
speaking
for
this
court
of
course,
and
the
underlying
argument,
one
that
is
deeply
ingrained
at
least
in
the
anglo
sect
in
the
system
of
jurisprudence
is
that
the
state
with
all
it
is
resources
and
power
should
not
be
allowed
to
make
repeated
attempts
to
convict
an
individual
for
an
alleged
offense,
thereby
subjecting
him
to
embarrassment,
expense,
an
ordeal
and
compelling
him
to
live
in
a
continuing
state
of
anxiety
and
insecurity
as
well
as
enhancing
the
possibility
that
even
though
innocent,
he
may
be
found
guilty.
in
other
words,
when
he
is
acquitted
he
is
acquitted
and
his
trial
is
over.
the
government
counsel
has
said
frankly
that
the
question
of
whether
not
corporations
and
the
only
parties
before
this
court
are
corporations,
are
entitled
to
protection
of
double
jeopardy
cause.
there
is
a
question
yet
to
be
determined
by
this
court
and
it
will
be
determined
on
appeal
if
the
court
takes
it
from
the
security
national
bank
case
out
of
the
second
circuit.
he
frankly
said
that
this
is
a
determination
that
need
not
be
made
by
this
court
in
this
case,
but
--
and
that
is
a
position
in
all
candor
that
the
government
takes
both
in
it
is
brief
or
petition
to
cert
and
also
in
its
main
brief
in
this
court.
on
the
other
hand,
i
cite
that
case
and
the
second
circuit
is
opinion
in
that
case
to
show
that
what
mr.
justice
black
said
about
the
rights
and
public
policy
as
to
individuals
applies
as
well
as
to
corporations
and
in
this
opinion,
in
december
1976,
the
second
circuit
in
unanimous
opinion
says
no
corporation,
large
or
small
can
escape
the
incalculable
effect
which
a
conviction
may
have
on
the
public
attitude
towards
the
company.
like
an
individual
it
must
answer
to
the
verdict
of
the
community.
no
corporations,
no
matter
how
large
can
pit
its
resources
against
the
overwhelming
might
of
the
state
so
as
to
avoid
the
harassment
and
the
increasing
probability
of
conviction
resulting
from
re-prosecutions
and
this
unequal
contest
“fundamental
fairness”
requires
that
the
government
having
had
a
full
try
at
establishing
criminal
wrongdoing
shall
not
have
another,
the
appeal
is
dismissed.
now
let
us
turn
those
considerations
to
what
we
have
here.
let
us
look
at
the
facts
of
our
case.
first
of
all
counsel
did
not
mentioned
that
the
1969
consent
decree
was
entered
into
and
negotiated
after
extended
grand
jury
proceedings,
considerable
time,
expense,
effort.
the
decree
was
entered
in
1971.
less
than
two
years
later,
we
were
faced
with
ex
parte
show
cause
orders
for
both
criminal
and
civil
contempt.
we
had
been
negotiating
when
we
had
been
with
them
for
at
least
three
years,
but
these
were
entered
ex
parte
by
the
government
at
the
government’s
motion.
then
we
were
faced
with
a
prior
appeal
on
the
motion
to
construe.
we
lost
that.
this
court
refused
the
cert
and
after
that
we
had
extensive
discovery
on
both
the
criminal
and
the
civil
contempt,
discovery
running
in
tandem,
in
addition
to
discovery
under
the
ominous
procedure
which
prevails
in
our
district
and
then
in
1975,
we
got
to
the
trial
of
this
case
and
i
think
it
is
very
important
for
this
court
to
know
the
comments
of
the
trial
judge
and
these
are
all
in
the
appendix.
first
of
all
the
government’s
position
in
the
trial
as
shown
on
page
31
and
32
clearly
shows
that
what
it
is
trying
to
do
is
prosecuting
industry
and
we
just
happen
to
be
the
lucky
target
for
the
disruptive
practices
that
the
government
talks
about
in
the
industry.
we
are
the
only
ones
as
the
record
shows
against
which
any
charges
like
this
have
been
made.
mr.
j.
burleson
smith
no
sir,
but
these
all
go
to
the
judge's
comments
that
are
in
the
appendix
which
show
the
state
of
mind
of
the
judge
when
he
found
not
guilty
and
acquitted.
mr.
j.
burleson
smith
that
is
fong
foo
if
the
court
please.
mr.
j.
burleson
smith
yes
sir
and
fong
foo
says
that
very
clearly.
i
think
the
whole
court
thought,
they
probably
thought
the
trial
judge
in
fong
foo
had
done
something
improvidently
in
dismissing
or
bringing
to
an
end
that
particular
litigation,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
court
--
there
was
an
acquittal
and
that
no
appeal
should
allow.
mr.
j.
burleson
smith
i
think
not
if
the
court
please.
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
determined
that
in
the
prior
appeal
and
said
that
criminal
contempt
is
for
purposes
of
our
problem
here
is…
mr.
j.
burleson
smith
and
that
of
course
is
one
factor
that
shows
the
comprehensive
effect
of
the
court’s
ruling
in
this
case
is
because
there
is
no
real
reason
that
it
should
not
apply
to
other
cases
except
for
the
fact
that
you
have
the
judge
finding
--
he
is
the
one
against
whom
the
contempt
is
posed.
mr.
j.
burleson
smith
i
think
on
that
we
would
have
to
say
that
whatever
distinctions
you
could
make
would
be
hard
to
abstain.
then
the
trial
court
says
and
this
indicates
that
when
he
dismissed
the
jury,
he
did
not
intend
to
terminate
this
trial.
he
made
some
remarks
from
the
bench
and
he
said
i
am
open
to
any
motions
that
either
side
would
like
to
file;
that
is
at
page
33
of
the
appendix,
then
on
that
same
page,
he
told
the
government,
i
think
you
have
had
your
day
in
court
on
the
criminal
contempt.
i
gave
you
every
opportunity
to
convict
these
defendants
and
you
came
very
close
on
the
corporate
defendants,
but
you
did
not
come
close
on
the
individual.
i
would
be
inclined
to
bring
this
thing
to
an
end
at
this
time
saying
in
to
the
government,
you
shot
your
best
shot
and
you
did
not
kill
anybody,
you
did
not
sustain
your
burden,
i
find
the
defendant’s
not
guilty
and
i
acquit
them,
this
is
getting
over
until
the
time
when
he
had
his
order.
mr.
j.
burleson
smith
you
mean
earlier?
mr.
j.
burleson
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
burleson
smith
he
did
not.
he
gave
the
government
full
opportunity
and
the
fifth
circuit
says
this
in
its
opinion.
he
gave
the
government
full
opportunity
to
shoot
everything
they
had,
they
shot
it
and
we
made
the
motion
at
the
end
of
the
government’s
case.
we
made
the
motion
to
acquit
at
the
end
of
the
whole
case.
but
now
this
rule
29…
mr.
j.
burleson
smith
yes,
he
did
and
at
all
tender
that
is
one
reason
we
do
not
want
them
to
have
another
shot,
but
also
the
government
has
got
another
shot
even
after
this
because
what
judge
would,
the
trial
judge
was
saying,
he
said,
let
us
get
on
with
the
civil
contempt.
let
us
get
on.
it
is
still
pending
and
there
is
nothing
that
the
government
could
get
in
this
criminal
contempt,
by
way
of
penalty
that
it
can
also
get
in
the
civil
contempt
which
is
presently
pending
in
the
trial
court.
now,
what
did
the
trial
court
say
when
he
entered
his
judgment
of
acquittal.
now
each
of
this
is
dated
april
22,
1975,
there
is
a
separate
judgment
of
acquittal
as
to
each
corporate
defendant.
the
court
finds
that
the
ground
set
forth
in
that
motion
are
good
and
valid
and
that
the
government
has
failed
to
prove
the
material
allegations
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
further
this
defendant
should
be
found
not
guilty,
is
accordingly
a
judge
that
respondent
martin
linen
supply
co
is
not
guilty
of
the
charges
against
it
and
is
hereby
acquitted
and
discharged
as
to
all
charges
herein.
that
is
the
judge’s
order
and
his
opinion.
the
fifth
circuit
of
court
held
that
there
was
no
appealability
and
no
appeal
available
to
the
government
and
it
is
our
position
of
course
that
each
of
those
judgments
are
the
judgments
of
both
courts
below
should
be
affirmed.
now,
if
its
not
affirmed,
if
those
judgments
are
not
affirmed,
how
are
we
going
to
describe
the
function
of
a
trial
judge
in
the
trial
of
a
criminal
case?
judge
simpson
on
the
panel
of
the
fifth
circuit
that
heard
the
argument,
an
old
trial
judge,
asked
the
government
counsel,
he
said
what
difference
is
there
between
the
acquittal
under
these
circumstances
and
the
acquittal
under
the
circumstances
of
robins
where
the
court
took
it
away
from
the
jury
at
the
end
of
the
government’s
case.
the
government
had
no
satisfactory
answer
to
the
court.
judge
dyer
also
an
old
experienced
trial
judge,
also
on
the
panel
said,
counsel
you
would
have
a
good
argument
if
there
were
not
anybody
in
that
courtroom
but
you
and
the
jury.
so
what
are
you
going
to
attribute
to
the
trial
judge?
now,
i
suggest
if
the
court
please,
that
unless
this
trial
court’s
judgment
of
acquittal
pursuant
to
rule
29
which
had
all
of
the
effect
of
extending
this
trial
in
which
this
judgment
of
acquittal
was
entered,
in
which
this
evidence
was
entered
and
introduced,
quite
contrary
to
sanford,
that
unless
this
judgment
of
acquittal
is
sustained
and
affirmed,
the
trial
judge
for
practical
purposes
will
be
sterilized
to
the
position
of
an
impotent
umpire.
he
will
be
in
the
trial
court
under
these
circumstances
and
a
position
quite
like
that
an
umpire
at
a
tennis
match.
if
he
cannot
do
something
definitive
as
the
presiding
officer
of
that
court
then
he
is
sitting
there
doing
not
much
more
than
calling
foot
faults,
out
of
bounds
and
net
balls.
i
suggest
that
the
proper
function
of
the
trial
court
is
to
put
him
where
he
is
to
make
decisions
and
that
is
what
i
think
mr.
justice
story
was
talking
back
about
his
early
as
1824
and
when
he
enters
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
its
just
as
effective
as
if
the
jury
had
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty.
thank
you
sir.
thank
your
honors.
