mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
the
double
jeopardy
clause
precludes
the
government
from
appealing
an
order
terminating
the
prosecution,
but
entered
after
a
mistrial
had
been
declared
because
the
jury
was
unable
to
agree
upon
a
verdict.
this
case
began
when
the
united
states
filed
a
civil
antitrust
complaint
against
respondents,
their
president
and
a
third
linen
supply
corporation.
the
parties
soon
agreed
upon
a
consent
decree
and
the
consent
decree
was
entered
in
the
summer
of
1969.
in
1971,
the
united
states
filed
petitions
charging
respondents
and
their
president
with
civil
and
criminal
contempt
with
that
consent
decree.
the
petitions
alleged
that
respondents
threatened
other
linen
supply
firms
with
retaliation
if
they
engaged
in
competition.
petitions
also
alleged
that
respondents
made
good
their
threats.
the
district
court
entered
an
order,
holding
that
the
allegations
did
not
sufficiently
charge
of
violation
of
the
consent
decree.
the
united
states
appealed
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
held
that
although
respondents
are
entitled
to
engage
in
vigorous
competition,
they
are
not
entitled
to
do
so
on
a
selective
or
retaliatory
basis
or
to
make
threats
to
competitors.
in
other
words,
the
court
of
appeals
held,
the
competition
must
be
directed
to
consumers
and
the
threats
of
reprisals
directed
to
competitors
were
inconsistent
with
the
consent
decree.
on
remand
in
a
district
court,
a
jury
trial
was
held
on
the
criminal
contempt
charges.
the
government
introduced
testimony
from
a
former
employee
of
respondents
and
from
respondents’
competitors
demonstrating
that
respondents
threaten
the
officers
of
competitors
with
retaliation
if
they
persisted
in
competing.
if
a
competitor
did
not
desist,
respondents’
mounted
a
competitor
specific
sales
campaign
that
is
instead
of
soliciting
all
potential
users
of
linen
supply
services.
they
directed
their
sales
efforts
toward
making
low
price
offers
to
the
customers
of
the
particular
offending
competitor.
they
also
made
threats
to
competitors
in
the
hope
that
these
threats
and
the
retaliatory
sales
campaigns
taken
together
would
stave
off
competition
by
making
it
more
costly.
at
the
end
of
trial,
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
of
not
guilty
with
respect
to
respondent’s
president
mr.
troy
who
had
not
been
linked
personally
with
any
of
the
threats.
the
jury
announced
that
it
was
hopelessly
deadlocked
with
respect
to
respondents,
although,
it
stood
11
to
1
in
favor
of
conviction.
the
judge
declared
a
mistrial
without
objection
and
he
dismissed
the
jury.
the
judge
then
invited
motions
for
judgments
of
acquittal.
he
expressed
dissatisfaction
with
the
consent
decree
stating
that
respondents
had
been
improvident
in
accepting
its
strictures.
he
also
stated
that
he
believed
the
evidence
introduced
by
the
government
was
inadequate.
respondents
accepted
the
invitation
and
six
days
later,
they
filed
motions
for
judgments
of
acquittal.
approximately
two
months
later,
the
judge
granted
both
of
those
motions
without
writing
an
opinion.
the
united
states
appealed
for
a
second
time.
it
argued
in
essence
that
the
testimony
at
trial
established
the
allegations
of
the
contempt
petitions
because
the
court
of
appeals
had
held
on
the
first
appeal
that
proof
of
threats
and
retaliatory
sales
campaigns
would
demonstrate
a
violation
of
the
consent
decree.
we
argued
that
the
district
court’s
grant
of
the
judgment
of
acquittal
not
withstanding,
at
least
prima
facie
proof
of
threats
and
retaliatory
sales
campaigns.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
your
honor,
directed
verdicts
of
acquittal
by
the
jury
were
abolished
by
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
29
(a)
and
therefore
in
our
view,
he
did
not
have
such
authority.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
not
by
a
directed
verdict
to
acquittal.
he
did
have
the
authority
at
that
stage
to
terminate
the
proceedings
by
entering
a
judgment
of
acquittal
on
his
own
which
would
represent
his
view
that
the
evidence
taken
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
government
together
with
all
of
his
legitimate
inferences
was
insufficient
to
make
out
a
case
for
the
jury.
although
in
this
case
he
did
not
do
that,
and
instead
he
allowed
the
jury
to
continue
its
deliberations
and
eventually
discharged
them,
and
he
did
not
declare
he
did
not
have
a
judgments
of
acquittal
until
two
months
and
five
days
later.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
was
indeed
and
we
think
that
that
kind
of
decision
can
be
appealed.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
but
before
i
come
to
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
two
issues
that
are
lurking
in
the
background
of
this
case
but
that
we
think
the
court
need
not
to
address.
the
first
of
these
issues
is
whether
the
double
jeopardy
clause
applies
to
corporations.
both
respondents
are
corporations
and
unless
the
double
jeopardy
clause
applies
to
them
in
a
way
that
creates
principles
of
finality
more
stringent
than
those
that
res
judicata
there
could
be
no
barred
with
second
trial
here.
i
will
not
discuss
that
issue
here
however,
because
it
was
not
raised
by
the
parties
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
discuss
it.
the
issue
is
squarely
presented,
however,
in
united
states
against
security
national
bank
in
which
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
is
pending.
the
united
states
believes
that
the
court
should
address
that
issue
in
security
bank,
but
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
do
so
in
this
case.
second
issue
i
will
not
discuss
at
length
is
the
effect
of
mid-trial
terminations
whether
they
are
called
judgments
of
acquittal
or
orders
dismissing
the
indictment.
we
have
discussed
that
problem
at
pages
12
to
19
of
our
brief
and
we
have
shown
that
there
is
no
absolute
bar
to
a
re-prosecution
unless
the
jury
returns
a
verdict
of
acquittal.
when
a
defendant
requests
a
mid-trial
termination,
he
has
exercised
his
right
to
control
the
conduct
of
the
proceedings
and
has
voluntarily
surrendered
his
right
to
receive
the
verdict
of
the
jury.
in
such
cases,
no
less
than
in
cases
in
which
the
mid-trial
termination
is
called
a
mistrial
like
united
states
against
dennis,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
bar
a
second
trial.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes.
it
would
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
are
not
at
all
abandoning
that
argument.
our
argument
is
in
the
last
analysis
that
only
a
verdict
of
acquittal
by
the
jury
is
an
absolute
bar
to
retrial.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
but
we
do
not
believe
it
is
necessary
to
reach
that
question
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
correct,
but
i
think
it
is
more
appropriate
for
me
to
make
here
at
a
greater
length
the
narrower
arguments
that
would
avoid
the
necessity
to
reach
that
particular
one.
although
i
will
say
that
the
mid-trial
termination
problem
has
recently
received
a
thoughtful
and
very
thorough
analysis
in
a
case
called
united
states
against
sanabria
decided
by
the
first
circuit
on
december
29.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
same
issue
was
involved.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes
your
honor.
it
is
the
same
issue.
this
case
however
simply
does
not
involve
the
mid-trial
termination.
the
case
went
to
completion
and
ended
in
a
mistrial
when
the
jury
was
unable
to
reach
a
verdict.
the
difficult
questions
presented
by
mid-trial
terminations,
therefore,
need
to
be
resolved
here.
in
our
view,
a
single,
simple
principle
controls
this
case.
it
is
a
principle
that
is
been
accepted
since
mr.
justice
story’s
opinion
for
the
court
in
1824
united
states
against
perez.
the
principle
is
this.
the
declaration
of
a
mistrial
because
the
jury
is
unable
to
agree
upon
a
verdict
removes
any
double
jeopardy
objection
to
a
second
trial.
once
the
jury
has
reached
an
impasse,
the
judge
is
entitled
to
set
the
case
for
a
second
trial
because
of
manifest
necessity.
we
do
not
understand
respondents
to
quarrel
with
this
and
if
the
district
court
may
set
the
case
for
a
second
trail
without
offending
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
then
the
court
of
appeals
may
direct
the
district
court
to
do
so.
this
follows
we
believes
from
united
states
against
sanford
decided
by
this
court
on
october
12th
of
last
year.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
bar
review
of
orders
entered
after
a
mistrial
has
been
declared
terminating
the
prosecution,
even
though
in
sanford,
the
order
was
based
in
substantial
part
on
evidence
that
was
heard
at
trial
and
even
though
in
sanford,
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
evidence
of
trial
showed
that
respondents
had
a
complete
defense
to
the
charges
against
them.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
our
statutory
authority
is
the
first
paragraph
of
the
criminal
appeals
act.
we
acknowledge
that
the
statutory
authority
does
not
speak
in
terms
of
judgments
of
acquittal,
but
that
language
was
thoroughly
analyzed
in
united
states
against
wilson
and
the
court
held
in
wilson
that
congress
intended
to
authorize
appeals
from
orders
terminating
the
prosecution
unless
those
appeals
were
barred
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
in
wilson
itself
the
case
had
gone
to
the
jury
and
thereafter
the
judge
entered
an
order
that
he
denominated
the
judgment
of
acquittal
and
there
was
an
argument
made
by
respondents
in
wilson
that
we
lack
statutory
authority
to
appeal.
the
court
rejected
that
argument
in
wilson
and
we
think
the
reasoning
in
wilson
is
dispositive
here.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
court
held
that
it
did
not
make
any
difference
i
think.
that
analysis
is
at
pages
347
or
348
to
351
of
wilson
and
that
what
the
judge
called
at
was
simply
immaterial.
the
salient
factor
was
it
terminated
the
prosecution
in
favor
of
the
defendant
and
that
was
a
fact
that
triggered
the
right
to
appeal
under
the
first
paragraph
of
the
act.
we
think
our
double
jeopardy
proposition
also
follows
quite
strongly
from
united
states
against
jorn
in
400
u.s.
in
jorn,
the
district
court
declared
a
mistrial
in
mid-trial.
then
it
dismissed
the
indictment
later
concluding
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
would
bar
second
trial.
this
court
entertained
an
appeal
from
that
decision.
it
ultimately
held
that
the
district
court
was
right
and
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
did
bar
a
second
trail
because
the
declaration
of
a
mistrial
in
mid-trial
amounted
to
judicial
over
reaching,
but
the
court
clearly
implied
that
if
the
declaration
of
a
mistrial
had
been
proper
and
it
also
would
have
been
proper
for
this
court
to
have
reversed
and
remanded
for
a
second
trial.
as
the
court
said
in
that
case
at
page
476,
a
mistrial
ruling
contemplates
re-prosecution
and
so
it
is
here.
the
court
of
appeals
has
the
power
to
remand
for
a
second
trial.
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
bar
the
way
because
it
was
proper
to
declare
a
mistrial
on
a
counter
jury
disagreement
and
the
jury’s
inability
to
agree
removed
the
bar
to
a
second
trial.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes
your
honor.
what
i
was
using
jorn
for
was
to
demonstrate
the
preposition
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
second
trial
would
follow
a
reversal
on
appeal
is
not
necessarily
an
independent
double
jeopardy
bar,
if
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
bar
that
second
trial.
in
jorn,
the
argument
was
the
double
jeopardy
clause
would
not
bar
the
second
trial
because
the
declaration
of
the
mistrial
had
been
proper.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
right.
here
the
argument
is
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
would
not
bar
the
second
trial
because
the
declaration
of
a
mistrial
because
of
jury
disagreement
was
clearly
(voice
overlapped)
disagree.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
right
and
that
presents
the
question
whether
the
double
jeopardy
clause
independently
bars
review
of
the
judges’
findings,
even
if
the
second
trial
would
not
by
itself
violate
the
clause.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
assuming
that
the
judgment
is
not…
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
means
in
this
case
that
according…
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
means
the
defendants
go
free,
that
is
right.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
and
cannot
be
tried
again
unless
we
prevail
on
appeal.
that
was
i
believe
the
same
situation
that
arose
in
sanford
decided
earlier
this
term
in
which
after
the
full
trial
occurred
and
the
case
went
to
a
mistrial
because
of
jury
disagreement.
the
judge
held
that
the
defendants
based
on
evidence
of
trial
had
an
absolute
defense
to
the
charge
of
the
indictment.
the
defense
was
governmental
consent.
if
we
had
not
appealed
that
order
in
sanford,
the
defendants
would
have
gone
free
and
that
would
the
end
of
the
case,
but
we
did
appeal
and
this
court
held
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
review
that
finding
and
reverse
and
remand
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
rule
29
(c)
was
to
bring
proceedings
to
a
close
in
the
case
where
the
government
did
not
have
a
case
and
i
would
like
to
make
one
thing
quite
clear
in
case
if
there
is
any
misunderstanding,
we
do
not
contend
that
a
second
trial
should
be
held
automatically
after
there
is
a
mistrial
declared.
there
may
be
reasons
in
particular
cases
why
a
second
trial
should
not
be
held.
in
the
present
case
for
example,
if
the
evidence
was
in
fact
insufficient
as
the
judge
believed
it
is
quite
appropriate
for
the
district
court
to
enter
a
judgment
of
acquittal
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case
absent
to
appellate
review,
but
we
believe
that…
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
district
judge
has
power
under
rule
29
(c)
to
enter
a
judgment
of
acquittal
at
any
time
during
the
trial
when
the
motion
is
made,
and
on
a
motion
made
within
seven
days
after
trial.
so
the
district
judge’s
order
in
this
case
was
clearly
within
his
power.
the
question
is
not,
and
we
have
never
contended
it
otherwise,
so
was
the
order
in
sanford,
clearly
within
the
judge’s
power
again,
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
had
the
power
to
do
exactly
what
he
did.
question
is
whether
he
erred
in
doing
so
and
if
he
erred,
whether
an
appeal
lies
to
correct
that
error.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
copy
of
the
order
is
in
our
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
towards
the
rear,
it
is
at
pages
40
(a)
to
43
(a),
there
are
two
separate
orders,
they
are
both
denominated
judgments
of
acquittal
and
in
both
of
those
orders
the
judge
recites
that
the
reasons
stated
in
the
motions
for
judgments
of
acquittal
are
good
and
valid
and
that
further
this
defendant
is
not
guilty.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
right.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
well,
our
position
is
that
once
the
jury
deadlocked,
the
fact
of
the
deadlock
is
the
manifest
necessity
to
create
the
right
to
a
second
trial.
whether
the
judge
says
the
formal
words,
i
declare
a
mistrial
is
quite
an
important
in
our
view,
that
it
is
functional
analysis
rather
than
a
formal
one
and
the
important
function
in
this
case
is
the
jury
was
unable
to
agree
that
the
first
trial
had
essentially
come
to
naught.
than
the
question
is
whether
the
double
jeopardy
clause
after
the
first
trial
has
come
to
naught
bars
a
second
trial
and
we
think
not,
and
for
that
purpose
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
judge
says,
i
grant
a
mistrial.
but
i
would
like
to
turn
back
question…
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no,
it
would
not
your
honor.
the
difference
is
this.
suppose
the
jury
had
come
back
and
said
that
it
was
deadlocked
and
the
judge
instead
of
saying,
i
direct
you
to
return
a
verdict
of
acquittal,
had
given
an
outrageously
erroneous
instruction
at
that
point
that
had
said,
when
the
jury
is
deadlocked…
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
your
case
is
the
case
in
which
the
judge
sends
the
jury
out
to
consider
under
outrageously
erroneous
instructions.
the
instruction
is
the
defendants
are
not
guilty,
return
a
verdict
of
acquittal.
at
that
point…
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
and
he
sends
the
jury
out
to
do
that.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
alright,
at
that
point,
our
argument
is
the
same
as
the
argument
here
and
in
our
view,
it
is
no
longer…
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
fong
foo
case
was
a
case
in
which
that
happened
in
mid-trial,
before
the
jury
said
it
was
unable
to
agree.
so
you
had
no
idea
in
fong
foo
whether
the
jury
was
favorably
disposed
to
defendants,
whether
the
jury
would
evaluate
the
prosecution’s
evidence
in
such
a
way
that
it
did
not
credit
the
prosecution’s
witnesses
as
judge
wizansky
(ph)
in
fong
foo
had
said
that
he
did
not
and
the
judge’s
instruction
in
mid-trail
in
fong
foo
deprived
the
defendants
of
their
opportunity
to
receive
that
verdict
from
the
jury,
but
in
the
hypothetical
you
gave,
the
case
went
unencumbered
to
the
jury,
the
jury
came
back
and
said,
we
are
deadlocked,
we
cannot
agree
and
at
that
point
we
think,
the
manifest
necessity
for
the
declaration
of
the
mistrial
is
just
(voice
overlap).
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
our
view
mr.
justice
stewart
that
what
happens
after
the
jury
is
unable
to
agree,
is
where
double
jeopardy
purpose
is
immaterial.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
even
though
it
is
an
instructed
verdict,
but
it
is
not
this
case.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
your
honor
and
we
agree
entirely
with
that.
the
judge
had
the
power
to
do
what
he
did
and
if
he
was
right,
first
of
all
we
would
not
appeal,
if
we
thought
he
was
right.
if
we
incorrectly
thought
he
was
wrong
and
we
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
should
affirm
and
that
is
still
the
end
of
this
case
and
the
defendant
is
still
free.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
your
honor,
in
our
view
that
is
a
much
more
difficult
case
because
if
he
simply
does
it
on
his
own,
it
deprives
the
defendant
of
his
right
to
receive
the
verdict
of
the
jury,
something
he
was
not
deprived
of
here.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
correct,
just
because
the
jury
was
unable
to
reach
a
verdict
and
that
is
the
same
as
in
any
mistrial
case.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no,
your
honor.
in
our
view
29
(c)
is
perfectly
applicable
and
the
judge
was
quite
within
his
power
in
doing
what
he
did.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
do
not
agree
with
that
proposition
your
honor.
in
our
view
under
the
argument
that
we
have
made
at
pages
12
to
19
of
our
brief,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
bar
a
second
trial,
if
the
defendants
ask
for
what
they
got,
then
in
our
view
it
is
complete…
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
your
honor,
in
our
view,
we
probably
cannot
appeal
that
judgment,
if
the
defendants
have
not
opened
their
mouths.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
there
are
two
differences.
one
is
the
jury
did
go
out
and
did
return
and
the
second
difference
is
the
defendants
asked
for
exactly
what
they
got
and
they
asked
for
it
and
got
it
when
they
asked
for
it.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
common
your
honor,
but
the
defense
counsel
also
has
the
option
to
ask
the
jury
first
and
then
ask…
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
if
the
judgment
of
acquittal
is
granted
and
if
he
was
not
entitled
to
it,
those
are
two
important
preconditions
in
our
view.
if
he
asked
for
something
to
which
he
was
not
entitled
and
voluntarily
asked
the
judge
to
take
this
case
away
from
the
jury,
then
in
our
view
he
has
surrendered
his
valued
right
to
receive
the
verdict
of
the
fact
finder
and
in
those
circumstances,
he
can
be
tried
the
second
time.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
know
i
was
–
i
am
sorry,
i
was
dealing
with
mr.
justice
marshall’s
hypothetical
and
that
again
is
not
this
case,
i
would
like
to
return.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
but
he
usually
has
his
choice
of
time.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
justice
stewart,
he
usually
has
his
choice
of
timing.
he
can
ask
for
it
from
the
jury
and
if
the
jury
returns
it
under
fong
foo
and
under
kepner
that
is
simply
final.
the
jury
has
the
power
to
return
final
verdicts.
if
he
asks
for
it
of
the
judge,
he
is
asking
for
a
purely
legal
ruling
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
if
he
decides
to
take
the
case
away
from
the
jury
in
our
view,
he
is
also
subjecting
himself
to
a
second
trial
if
it
turns
out
that
he
was
not
entitled
to
have
that
case
taken
from
the
jury…
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
but
unless
the
prosecution
agrees
to
do
that,
the
prosecution
also
has
a
right
to
have
the
case
go
to
the
jury
which
is
what
upheld
in
singer
and
we
have
indeed
relied
on
singer
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes
we
have.
i
would
like
to
discuss
briefly
the
case
of
united
states
against
wilson
which
i
think
addresses
some
of
the
things
i
have
been
discussing
with
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
marshall.
in
wilson,
the
court
returned
the
verdict
of
guilty
and
the
judge
then
entered
a
judgment
of
acquittal
which
he
called
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
based
on
the
evidence
that
was
heard
at
trial.
the
court
held
that
such
a
judgment
can
be
reviewed
and
reversed
and
the
fact
that
it
is
called
an
acquittal
is
irrelevant.
the
court
summarized
this
in
united
states
against
jenkins,
420
u.s
at
page
365
by
saying
that
when
“the
jury
returns
a
verdict
of
guilt,
that
the
trial
court
thereafter
enters
a
judgment
of
acquittal
and
appeal
is
permitted.”
in
other
words,
nothing
in
the
double
jeopardy
clause
bars
appellate
review
of
the
judge’s
decision
to
acquit
the
defendants,
even
based
on
evidence
of
trial,
because
we
understand
that
to
be
the
import
of
statement
in
jenkins.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
your
honor,
the
judgment
entered
in
wilson
was
denominated
by
the
judge
as
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes
it
was…
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
argued
in
wilson
that
that
is
what
it
was
really,
functionally
a
judgment
of
dismissal
and
it
was
not
a
judgment
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
correct,
but
my
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
my
use
of
wilson
for
that
purpose
was
because
we
have
had
in
wilson
a
very
long
and
complicated
argument
about
whether
this
document
which
was
called
a
judgment
of
acquittal
was
in
form
or
in
function
an
order
dismissing
the
indictment.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
court
reached
the
conclusion
in
wilson
as
i
read
that
case
though
by
deciding
that
did
not
make
any
difference.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
can
also
refer
you
to
337
to
339
in
which
the
court
discusses
what
congress
meant
in
passing
the
criminal
appeals
act,
but
i
can
go
beyond
wilson
i
think,
because
in
united
states
against
sanford,
we
have
the
same
problem
we
have
here.
in
sanford,
the
judge
entered
an
order
saying
that
the
defendants
had
a
perfect
defense
and
on
that
account,
he
dismissed
the
indictment,
but
the
argument
on
the
other
side
was
although
that
was
called
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment,
it
was
really
in
function
an
acquittal
and
we
appealed
and
this
court
held
that
we
were
entitled
to
appeal
under
the
criminal
appeals
act
for
the
reason
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
did
not
bar
a
second
trial.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
cannot
call
it
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment,
but
what
we
can
say
is
it
does
not
make
any
difference.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
can
say
i
think
your
honor
that
congress
intended
in
the
criminal
appeals
act
to
remove
all
non
constitutional
bars
to
appeal
from
final
orders
terminating
the
prosecution
and
that
congress
used
language
that
it
thought
encompassed
all
of
those
categories
of
final
orders
terminating
the
prosecution
and
although
it
did
not
use
this
particular
language,
under
the
interpretation
of
that
statute
in
wilson
which
goes
back
to
the
legislative
history,
congress
intended
its
language
to
be
broad
enough
to
cover
this
case.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
one
more
point
mr.
justice
stevens,
the
third
circuit
in
wilson
had
held
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
the
judgment
in
that
case
was
in
fact
an
acquittal
and
not
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment,
that
it
was
an
acquittal
in
both
form
and
functions.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
do
not
dispute
that.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
sanford
supports
that
proposition,
absolutely
because
in
function,
the
judgment
in
sanford
was
an
acquittal.
it
was
an
order
based
on
the
evidence
of
trial
holding
that
the
defendants
had
committed
no
crime
and
the
court
held
that
we
could
appeal
in
sanford.
wilson
supports
that
not
because
the
order
in
wilson
was
in
function,
an
acquittal
based
on
insufficiency
of
the
evidence,
but
because
of
the
court’s
analysis
of
a
legislative
history
and
the
intend
of
congress
to
permit
appeals
whenever
the
double
jeopardy
clause
would
not
bar
them
and
that
leaves
in
our
view
only
the
constitutional
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
was
not
a
case
where
the
indictment
did
not
charge
a
crime.
the
indictment
charged
the
crime
in
wilson,
but
the
court
found
that
there
were
other
reasons
outside
the
indictment
and
completely
apart
from
the
face
of
the
indictment
why
there
should
not
be
a
trial
and
this
the
court
had
analyzed
the
old
criminal
appeal
act
in
sisson
the
defect
had
to
appear
on
the
face
of
the
indictment
which
was
not
true
in
wilson.
