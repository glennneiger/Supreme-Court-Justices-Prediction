unknown
speaker
in
your
view
mr.
easterbrook,
i
assume
at
the
stage
of
trial
that
the
jury
announced
it
was
deadlocked,
was
there
an
authority
in
the
judge
to
at
that
point
direct
a
verdict
of
acquittal?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
had
no
authority
at
that
stage
to
terminate
the
proceedings
by
an
acquittal?
unknown
speaker
but
the
motion
is
filed
within
seven
days
as
provided
by
rule
29
(c)?
unknown
speaker
the
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal.
unknown
speaker
and
that
motion
was
granted.
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
do.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
argument
in
your
brief
under
a
would
cover
a
mid-trial
termination?
unknown
speaker
it
is
only
the
argument
under
b
that
would
cover
this
case,
but
not
a
mid-trial.
are
you
abandoning
that
argument?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
talking
about
a
mid-trial
termination?
unknown
speaker
but
if
we
access
your
argument
a,
we
have
reached
the
question,
have
we
not?
unknown
speaker
that
is
involved
in
the
brown
case,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
decision
for
certiorari
is
pending
here?
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook
before
you
get
too
deeply
into
the
double
jeopardy
argument,
do
not
you
have
a
statutory
problem?
what
is
the
statutory
language
that
supports
the
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
acquittal?
unknown
speaker
in
wilson,
it
did
not
occur
in
effect
that
it
was
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment?
unknown
speaker
in
the
jorn
case
the
district
court
as
i
remember
had
dismissed
indictment
because
he
thought
that
a
new
trial
was
constitutionally
impermissible
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
and
that
view
was
ultimately
affirmed
in
this
court.
in
this
case
by
contrast,
the
district
judge
entered
a
judgment
of
acquittal
not
because
of
any
views
about
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
but
because
of
his
views
of
the
case
on
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
and
that
argument
was
ultimately
rejected.
unknown
speaker
well,
here
the
argument
is,
i
do
not
know
whose
argument
you
are
talking
about,
here
your
opponent’s
argument
is
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
bars
a
new
trial
because
there
has
been
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
of
not
guilty.
unknown
speaker
what
is
effect
of
the
finding
of
acquittal?
unknown
speaker
does
it
mean
not
guilty?
unknown
speaker
it
means
that
he
goes
free?
unknown
speaker
and
cannot
be
tried
again
on
that
charge?
unknown
speaker
but
the
rule
29
(c),
what
was
the
purpose
of
it?
unknown
speaker
at
what
stage,
at
what
point
precisely
did
the
district
judge
do
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook,
you
told
us
at
the
beginning
that
in
entering
the
order
the
district
court
wrote
no
opinion,
but
i
cannot
even
find
copy
of
the
order
here.
unknown
speaker
i
could
not
see
that.
unknown
speaker
and
he
used
the
phrase
not
guilty.
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
there
has
been
mistrial,
but
the
judge
had
just
exercised
his
power
to
enter
a
judgment
of
acquittal
or
when
the
jury
reported
that
they
were
deadlocked,
that
would
be
the
mistrial
sort
of
thing?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
says
specifically
that
you
can
do
it
after
the
jury
is
deadlocked.
unknown
speaker
that
gives
you
judgment
of
the
given
case
before
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
he
has
not
been
deprvied
of
it
very
much
to
get
it
directed.
unknown
speaker
what
verdict
of
the
jury
is
not
here,
you
have
not
gotten
any
verdict
either.
unknown
speaker
it
happens
that
the
jury
have
afforded
an
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
if
he
grants
the
judgment
of
(inaudible)
as
the
jury
would
allow
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
and
then
nothing
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
the
same
case
is
relevant
here,
one
could
analyze
his
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
for
acquittal
as
a
position
at
that
time,
i
am
not
going
to
waive
the
jury
and
ask
the
judge.
unknown
speaker
you
have?
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook,
i
have
to
interrupt
you
because
you
had
called
my
attention
to
the
wilson
case
and
the
court
describes
the
order
of
the
district
court
as
the
dismissal
of
the
indictment
at
two
or
three
places
at
the
beginning
of
the
opinion,
where
do
you
find
that
was
a
judgment?
unknown
speaker
it
was
on
the
ground,
was
it
not
that
there
was
unreasonable
delay
in
final
hearing?
unknown
speaker
so,
that
is
certainly
and
normally,
be
properly
called
the
dismissal.
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
true
as
this
case
--
unknown
speaker
you
have
a
statutory
problem.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
everybody
agrees
now
that
it
was
in
function
an
order
dismissing
the
indictment
whereas
in
this
case,
in
function
we
have
an
order
acquitting
the
defendant,
are
they
not
different.
unknown
speaker
where
did
you
find
that
in
the
wilson,
i
just
read
the
page
that
you
cited
before
and
i…
unknown
speaker
that
depends
on
whether
in
function
the
order
is
a
dismissal
and
acquittal,
but
how
can
you
characterize
this
is
in
function
as
the
dismissal
after
the
trial
is
all
over,
that
i
do
not
understand.
on
the
ground
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
support
the
verdict
to
guilty,
that
is
the
reason
the
judge
gave
and
how
can
you
call
that
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
if
you
cannot
call
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment,
you
cannot
appeal.
unknown
speaker
and
maybe
congress
correctly
thought
that
a
judgment
of
acquittal
could
not
be
appealed
because
a
retrial
would
be
barred
by
them,
double
jeopardy
clause,
and
maybe
the
reason
they
did
not
use
any
phrase.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
all
that,
but
how
you
get
over
the
fact
that
in
this
case
in
function
it
is
an
acquittal.
what
else
you
do
on
the
evidence
offered
by
the
government
is
insufficient
to
support
the
charge,
the
man
you
filed
is
acquittal,
isn't
he?
that
is
functionally
what
happened
here.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
before
you
get
to
those
cases,
just
so
i
know
what
your
answer
to
this
question
is
when
you
are
discussing
those
other
cases.
supposing
the
jury
returns
the
verdict
of
guilty
and
within
seven
days
the
judge
enters
an
order
of
acquittal.
i
take
it
your
submission
is
that
even
though
it
would
not
be
a
necessity
for
any
new
trial
afterwards
that
the
mere
fact
of
acquittal
seals
the
case
and
it
is
unappealable.
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
saying
then
i
take
it
that
just
the
fact
that
the
judge
has
done
what
the
rule
has
entitled
him
to
do,
namely
under
a
judgment
of
acquittal
based
on
the
evidence,
automatically
forbids
appeal.
unknown
speaker
again,
i
just
want
to
know,
is
it
appealable
or
not?
may
the
government
appeal
that
judgment
of
acquittal?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
general
motion
under
29c
within
seven
days.
unknown
speaker
and
if
it
reversed,
the
guilty
verdict
is
reinstated?
unknown
speaker
now,
i
would
like
to
listen
to
those
cases.
unknown
speaker
the
merits
of
your
case
or
the
government’s
case
are
not
really
before
us
here,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
but
your
position
is
that
even
if
the
judge
was
–
when
pressed
your
position
would
be
that
even
if
the
judge
was
quite
wrong
in
entering
the
judgment
of
acquittal,
nonetheless
it
is
not
appealable?
unknown
speaker
exactly
and
that
has
to
be
your
position.
unknown
speaker
and
the
fact
really
that
this
was
a
criminal
contempt
rather
than
a
mine-run
claim,
and
like
criminal
case
does
not
have
anything
basically
to
do
with
the
issue
before
us,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
this
case
has
been
argued
just
as
though
it
were
a
mine-run
criminal
prosecution.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
a
little
circumstance
of
this
case,
but
it
does
not
really
affect
the
basic
issue
here.
unknown
speaker
he
had
two
other
opportunities
to
say
the
same
thing,
did
he
not?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
yes
(inaudible)
and
he
did
not.
unknown
speaker
he
convinced
the
eleven
jurors
though,
did
he
not?
