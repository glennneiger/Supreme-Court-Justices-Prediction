justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'll
announced
first
the
opinion
and
judgment
in
united
states
v.
martin
linen
supply.
this
is
a
case
that
arises
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
perhaps
the
most
fundamental
rule
in
double
jeopardy
jurisprudence
is
that
an
acquittal,
however,
erroneous
is
not
appealable
by
the
government
and
that
because
the
double
jeopardy
clause
flatly
prohibits
the
government
from
putting
the
defendant
after
acquittal
to
a
trial
a
second
time.
that
barred
to
an
appeal
applies
when
the
jury
returns
the
verdict
of
acquittal
after
deliberation
and
also
when
the
jury
returns
the
verdict
of
acquittal
upon
order
or
direction
of
the
trial
judge
to
do
so.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
constitutional
bar
applies
in
the
case
of
the
judgment
of
acquittal
that
was
entered
in
this
case.
here,
the
jury
deliberated
and
finally
reported
to
the
trial
judge
that
it
was
hopelessly
deadlocked.
thereupon,
the
trial
judge
without
directing
the
jurors
to
return
the
verdict
of
acquittal
discharged
them.
but
rule
29(c)
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
expressly
provides
and
i'm
quoting
the
rule,
"if
the
jury
is
discharged
without
having
returned
the
verdict,
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
may
be
made
within
seven
days
after
the
jury
is
discharged
and
the
court
may
enter
judgment
of
acquittal.‚Äù
that's
the
end
of
the
quote.
the
respondents
in
this
case
took
advantage
of
that
provision
and
within
seven
days
after
the
jury
is
discharged
filed
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal.
two
months
later,
the
trial
judge
granted
the
motion
and
entered
the
judgments
of
acquittal.
the
government's
appeal
from
those
judgments
was
dismissed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
on
the
ground
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
barred
the
united
states
from
trying
the
respondents
a
second
time
and
therefore
no
appeal
laid
from
the
judgments
of
acquittal.
we
agree
and
we
affirmed,
we
too
reject
the
government's
argument
that
the
double
jeopardy
bar
applies
only
when
the
jury
hereafter
deliberation
or
on
direction
of
the
trial
judge
returns
a
verdict
of
acquittal.
since
rule
29
(c)
have
for
its
purpose
affording
the
trial
judge
greater
flexibility
and
timing,
the
judgment
of
acquittal
no
persuasive
faces
exists
for
construing
rule
29
(c)
as
weakening
the
trial
court's
binding
authority
for
purposes
of
double
jeopardy.
mr.
justice
stevens
being
of
the
view
that
in
any
event
has
no
statutory
authority
for
a
government
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
acquittal
in
a
criminal
case
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
the
chief
justice
dissents
and
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
