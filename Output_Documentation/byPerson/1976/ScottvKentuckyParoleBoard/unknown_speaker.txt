unknown
speaker
well,
mr
rivkin
one
another
question,
if
i
may?
unknown
speaker
if,
now
being
on
parole,
his
parole
is
sought
to
be
revoked,
he
would
get
a
morrissey
type
hearing,
would
he
not?
unknown
speaker
that
is
because
he
now
has
a
conditional
liberty
outside
the
walls
of
the
institution.
unknown
speaker
this
sentence
you
mean?
unknown
speaker
those
are
not
two
separate
grounds,
but
together
they
are
one
ground.
unknown
speaker
that
is
capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review?
unknown
speaker
right,
yes.
unknown
speaker
that
is,
if
it
is
a
class
action.
unknown
speaker
did
you
do
that
in
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
but
did
you
move
to
have
it
certify
as
a
class
action?
unknown
speaker
you
could
have
had
intervention
in
court
of
appeals
without
any
problem.
unknown
speaker
i
think
i
read
in
brief
that
you
had
hundreds
of
these
guys
who
are
claimants
at
your
door,
so
why
did
not
you
put
some
more
of
them
in
there,
just
as
a
precaution?
if
this
put
enough
in
there,
they
would
not
have
paroled
all
of
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
did
not
you?
unknown
speaker
i
guess,
you
could
not
make
it
a
--
the
court
of
appeals
could
not
have
certified,
even
if
you
had
asked
them.
unknown
speaker
they
do
not
certify
because
of
mootness.
unknown
speaker
if
you
had
asked
for
the
certification
in
the
court
of
appeals;
my
question
is
could
the
court
of
appeals
certify?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
i
misunderstood
you.
you
said
in
the
trial
court,
you
did
not
have
a
chance
to
have
it
certified.
unknown
speaker
you
did
not
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
mentioned
in
passing
or
in
describing
the
case,
as
i
recall,
that
it
was
a
class
action.
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree
that
the
state
legislature
can
simply
abandon
a
parole
system
entirely?
unknown
speaker
who
attends
the
five
or
ten
minutes
hearing?
unknown
speaker
that
is
all?
unknown
speaker
legislature
provides
for
no
hearing
if
they
wanted
to,
that
there
is
no
presence
of
the
prisoner,
would
you
think
that?
unknown
speaker
hearing
to
find
how?
unknown
speaker
with
court’s
assistance…
unknown
speaker
and
would
you
allow
prior
access
to
the…
unknown
speaker
before
the
actual
hearing?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rivkin
in
your
brief,
i
notice
was
filed
before
this
court’s
decision
in
meachum
against
fano.
are
you
going
to
discuss
the
application
of
that
case
to
your
contention?
unknown
speaker
with
your
oral
submission
here
and
answers
to
the
questions
of
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
brennan
have
not
deviated
from
your
brief,
i
would
say
on
specifically
2
(b)
one,
two,
three
and
four
of
the
last
20
pages
of
your
brief.
those
are
the
four.
unknown
speaker
as
part
of
your
argument,
to
the
extent
we
have
allowed
you
to
make
is
directed
to
the
claimant
liberty.
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
that
you
have
persuaded
us
that
liberty
is
involved.
you
got
to
deal
a
little
more
in
that,
do
not
you,
under
the
language
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
there
has
to
be
a
deprivation
of
liberty
without
due
process
involved.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say,
illegitimate
criteria,
is
not
under
kentucky
law
the
decision
of
the
board
is
final?
unknown
speaker
to
that
extent
and
the
state
has
set
up
some
system
within
its
own
jurisdiction
for
correcting
illegitimate,
what
you
call
use
of
illegitimate
criteria?
unknown
speaker
did
the
state
court
put
it
on
a
federal
constitutional
ground?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
parole
as
grace
and
then
you
speak
out
as
a
pre-morrissey
decision.
certainly
morrissey
did
not
hold
that
parole
was
not
a
matter
of
grace,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
i
would
not
have
thought
so.
i
thought
that
the
idea
was
that
if
you
are
once
granted
parole
and
you
are
in
fact
free
from
supervision
then
if
that
is
to
be
revoked,
you
are
entitled
to
a
hearing.
unknown
speaker
that
certainly
does
not
hold
that
parole
or
granting
or
denial
of
parole
is
not
a
matter
of
grace.
unknown
speaker
well,
now
why
do
you
say
that
the
court
rejected
that
in
morrissey?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
parole
once
granted.
morrissey
was
done
by
the
revocation
of
an
existing
liberty
status.
you
are
not
asking
to
push
that
further
and
say
that
before
the
state
has
granted
that
liberty,
you
nonetheless
have
a
liberty,
interest.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rivkin,
your
brief
i
think
includes
the
statistics
on
the
percentage
of
applications
for
parole
that
are
actually
granted
in
kentucky.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
which
hearing
are
you
talking
about,
the
hearing
on
the
ground
of
the
scene
or
the
hearing
back
at
the
institution?
unknown
speaker
by
the
time
he
has
last
hearing,
the
time
he
has
the
second
hearing
back
at
the
institution,
under
morrissey,
he
still
is
in
a
conditional
liberty
status,
is
he
not?
his
parole
has
not
yet
been
revoked.
unknown
speaker
it
has
then
not
then
revoked.
unknown
speaker
incarcerated
in
the
same
sense,
a
person
is
incarcerated
when
he
is
arrested
before
he
is
charged?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
not
meachum
reject
the
idea
that
there
could
be
any
claim
for
a
hearing
in
connection
with
the
transfer
other
than
on
a
statutory
basis?
unknown
speaker
but
it
has
not
said
you
will
be
paroled
if
such
and
such
condition
has
met,
has
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
then
that
is
a
non-statutory
thing.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
did
not
meachum
reject
the
notion
that
a
practice,
even
if
it
could
be
shown
with
the
equivalent
of
a
statutory
entitlement.
unknown
speaker
you
said
that
even
though
there
is
not
a
explicit
statutory
provision
of
a
kind
as
described
in
my
brother
rehnquist’s
question
there.
there
is
a
kind
of
common
law
entitlement
similar
to
a
practical
entitlement,
as
similar
to
that
discussed
in
perry
versus
sindermann
and
the
roth
case.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
knowing
that?
first
of
all
the
district
judge
dismissed
this
without
any
opportunity
--
unknown
speaker
their
occasion
to
certify
it
class,
although
it
was
requested
in
the
complaint.
unknown
speaker
and
how
do
you
explain
the
court
of
appeals
reference
to
this
case
as
a
class
action?
it
is
in
the
fourth
line
of
their
opinion,
short
of
the
quarter.
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
explanation
to
that.
it
was
not
conceded
to
be
a
class
action.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kimberlin,
i
think
the
petitioner
is
still
in
custody
in
a
legal
sense,
and
that
he
is
on
parole
now.
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean
he
is
subject
to
certain
restrictions
on
his
conduct?
unknown
speaker
under
the
kentucky
procedure,
may
he
apply
for
a
change
in
the
present
restrictions?
is
there
a
procedure
for
a
person
on
parole
seeking
to
modify
the
restrictions
that
are
imposed?
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
in
the
nature
of
a
parole
release
hearing
that
he
made
such
an
application?
unknown
speaker
in
a
modification
he
would
be
entitled
to
any
particular
kind
of
procedure
that
would
be
followed
in
such
a
request?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
what
about
petitioner’s
figure
that
one-third
of
them
do?
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
pretty
good
percentage.
unknown
speaker
you
assumed
that
he
would,
i
do
not
think
you
have
assumed
either
one,
can
you?
unknown
speaker
and
it
also
recognizes
the
fact
that
one-third
do
not.
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
want
you
to
give
a
legal
advice
of
the
petitioner
or
run
a
law
school
or
anything,
but
how
could
he
avail
all
of
this?
unknown
speaker
how
could
the
petitioner
in
this
case
evade
the
situation
he
is
now
in?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
thought,
i
limited
to
this
case,
what
could
he
have
done
in
this
case,
where
he
had
two
people,
he
asked
class
action,
the
judge
ignored
it,
what
could
he
have
done?
unknown
speaker
and
the
thought
this
is
that
is
what?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
of
any
case?
unknown
speaker
so
i
guess
he
is
just
stuck.
all
the
state
has
to
do
is
when
a
man
files
a
suit
like
this,
to
parole
him,
and
as
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that
your
suggestion
is
that
he
could
have
asked
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
the
case
is
not
against
him,
it
is
his
case.
unknown
speaker
then
the
class
action
is
just
out.
unknown
speaker
and
you
do
not
know
of
any
way
to
keep
it
in.
unknown
speaker
and
you
do
not
know
of
any
way
that
a
group
of
prisoners
who
want
this
done
can
get
relief
other
than
all
of
them
joining
as
petitioner.
unknown
speaker
your
answer
is
the
only
way
to
join
in
lawsuit.
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
the
end
of
class
action
in
this
field.
unknown
speaker
as
a
class
action
in
prisoner
cases,
where
they
can
be
paroled,
there
is
no
way
for
class
action.
unknown
speaker
where
a
district
judge
refuses
to
certify
a
class,
there
is
no
possibility
of
a
class
action.
unknown
speaker
i
am
back
to
justice
rehnquist
question
about
the
petitioner
having
been
granted
all
the
relief
he
sought.
he
did
complained
of
the
fact
he
did
not
get
an
adequate
hearing
the
first
time
he
came
up
for
parole,
did
he
not?
unknown
speaker
and
if
he
should
prevail
in
the
litigation,
is
it
completely
unconceivable
that
there
might
be
some
remedy
for
the
failure
to
grant
the
hearing
when
he
says
he
was
constitutionally
entitled
for
hearing
for
his
damages
or
his
statements
or
reasons
for
the
first
time,
is
that
unconceivable?
unknown
speaker
then
how
come
the
case
be
moved?
unknown
speaker
but
he
is
seeking
relief
in
a
federal
court
now
for
that
very
reason?
unknown
speaker
but
he
did
not
get
the
parole
the
first
time
he
asked
for
it?
unknown
speaker
he
served
some
time
in
jail
as
a
result
of
that.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you
do
that.
unknown
speaker
any
idea
that
there
is
some
retroactive
possible
kind
of
relief
presupposes
the
answers
of
the
question
presented
by
the
entire
case,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
did
they
complaint
or
asked
for
the
damages?
unknown
speaker
the
last
paragraph
for
relief
is
the
plaintiffs
be
awarded
any
and
all
other
relief
to
which
they
or
the
members
of
their
class
may
appear
to
be
entitled
under
that
prayer
a
judge
would
have
the
power
to
grant
broader
relief.
unknown
speaker
when
we
talk
about
mootness,
we
are
talking
about
the
power
of
the
district
court,
not
the
form
of
the
pleading,
are
we
not?
unknown
speaker
was
that
your
understanding
that
the
court
could
have
award
damages
without
a
specific
added
prayer
for
damages?
unknown
speaker
that
was
my
thought.
unknown
speaker
general
kimberlin,
let
me
put
a
hypothetic
case
to
you.
supposing
that
state
of
kentucky
had
a
system
in
determining
sentences,
which
provided
that
say
the
sentence
would
be
one
to
three
years,
that
after
the
prisoner
served
the
first
year,
there
would
be
a
hearing
before
the
judge
at
which
time
the
judge
would
decide
whether
or
not
any
additional
time
should
be
served,
and
the
judge
would
have
absolute
and
total
discretion,
either
to
release
the
man
at
that
time
or
to
say
he
should
serve
another
year
or
two.
would
the
due
process
clause
entitle
the
prisoner
to
a
fair
hearing
at
that
time?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
first
question,
as
soon
as
you
answer
that
i
am
going
to
ask
the
case
of
any
different,
if
the
power
were
given
to
a
parole
board
instead
of
a
judge.
unknown
speaker
well,
their
argument
of
course
is
that
as
a
practical
matter,
the
sentencing
process
really
has
not
ended,
that
is
why
i
am
trying
to
put
the
hypothetical
case
where
the
statute
had
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
decision
on
how
long
the
man
would
be
incarcerated
would
be
made
by
a
judge
after
a
third
of
the
statutory
period
had
already
been
served
and
the
judge
would
then
have
absolute
discretion
either
to
prolong
the
period
of
incarceration
or
to
release
the
man.
how
would
that
be
different
from
the
situation
we
have?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
if
that
is
not
different,
would
the
due
process
clause
apply
to
such
a
hearing?
i
think
that
may
be
the
issue
here.
unknown
speaker
so
the
key
to
your
position
really
is
the
totality
of
the
discretion
invested
in
the
parole
board
or
the
sentencing
judge?
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
his
position
is
that
it
is
a
liberty
interest
because
the
question
to
be
decided
is
how
long
shall
a
man
stay
in
jail?
unknown
speaker
that
seems
to
be
one
of
the
60%
instead
of
one
of
the
40%.
unknown
speaker
actually
deprived
of
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kimberlin
i
have
another
point.
what
is
“close
supervision”
in
kentucky?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
does
he
has
to
go
to
the
prison
everyday
or
you
spend
nights
there,
but
what
is
the…
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
this
case
has
moot
because
the
man
is
out
on
parole
under
“close
supervision”
and
you
tell
me
that
i
do
not
need
to
know
what
“close
supervision”
is?
unknown
speaker
petitioner
would
put
it
in
the
record
in
this
case
as
to
the
nature
of
the…
unknown
speaker
well,
whose
job
is
it
on
this
mootness
point?
it
is
his
job,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
he
has
to
report
to
the
prison
three
days
a
week,
and
spends
two
days
in
the
prison,
would
you
say
the
case
was
moot?
unknown
speaker
if
he
was
released
on
parole
one
hour
a
week,
would
you
say
this
case
was
moot?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
makes
it
moot,
is
that
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
saying
if
he
is
not
really
out,
it
would
not
be
moot,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
if
he
was
not
actually
out
which
is
just
as
clear
to
me
as
“close
supervision.”
unknown
speaker
general
kimberlin
that
is
the
very
point.
what
do
you
say
about
the
goldsmith
against
the
board
of
tax
appeals,
the
case
involving
the
account
that
wanted
to
get
admitted.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
just
interrupt
you.
was
it
a
statutory
matter
or
was
it
a
policy
by
practice
over
and
over
that
they
could
admit
these
people?
unknown
speaker
did
not
the
rule
and
the
tax
case
specifically
provide
that
the
board
had
absolute
discretion
to
turn
the
man
down?
unknown
speaker
did
you
read
the
goldsmith
case
is
indicating
that
any
lawyer
in
any
accountant
was
entitled
to
be
admitted
to
practice?
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
suppose
no
hearing
were
accorded
to
prison
inmate
at
all
and
the
board
denied
parole
without
any
hearing,
what
recourse,
if
any
would
the
prisoner
have?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
