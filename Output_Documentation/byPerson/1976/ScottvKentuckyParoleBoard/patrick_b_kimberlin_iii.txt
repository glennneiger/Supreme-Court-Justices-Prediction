mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
the
respondents
would
first
address
themselves
the
threshold
issue
here
which
we
believe
is
one
of
jurisdiction.
as
the
court
is
aware,
the
petitioner
was
released
on
parole.
we
believe
that
this
fact
has
essentially
mooted
the
case,
and
therefore,
this
court
no
longer
has
jurisdiction
under
article
3,
since
it
is
no
longer
an
active
case
of
controversy.
we
believe
that
the
fact
that
he
has
been
paroled
eliminated
any
personal
stake
in
the
outcome
which
he
may
have
had
in
this
case.
furthermore,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
fact
that
when
the
complaint
was
filed
in
this
action,
it
had
allegations
pertained
to
a
class
action
or
requesting
class
action
under
rule
23.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
case
was
not
certified
as
a
class
action.
it
has
never
been
certified
as
a
class
action
and
of
course
there
has
been
no
definition
of
a
class
in
this
case.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes,
your
honor
that
is
true.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
reference
to
it
as
a
class
action
in
effect
stable
should
as
a
class
action,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
that
is
correct
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
it
was
not
conceded
to
be
a
class
action
at
any
time
your
honor.
furthermore,
we
do
not
believe
that
this
particular
---
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
he
is
on
parole
now.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes,
he
is
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes,
it
is
possible
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
no,
well
in
a
parole
release
hearing,
yes,
it
would
be
somewhat
similar
to
that,
but
not
a
parole
consideration
hearing.
a
parole
consideration
would
determine
the
initial
issue
of
whether
to
actually
grand
a
parole
as
opposed
any
modification
of
a
parole,
once
it
is
in
fact
granted.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well,
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
exactly
what
the
procedure
would
be
or
what
he
would
be
entitled
to
in
that
type
of
hearing
in
which
he
would
ask
for
modification,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
we
do
not
think
that
this
case
falls
within
the
during
the
old
doctrine
of
a
case
of
a
reoccurring
nature
yet
evading
review,
because
it
appears
to
be
that
this
particular
doctrine
only
applies
to
cases
where
the
same
parties
once
again
come
into
conflict
at
some
subsequent
time.
here
we
believe
that
best
only
a
very
remote
possibility
that
the
petitioner
would
at
some
crucial
point
in
time
valid
his
parole
which
is
what
he
would
have
to
do.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well,
that
figure
of
course
would
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
but
that
only
applies
to
those
who
actually
do,
and
i
do
not
believe
this
court
would
have
to
entertain
the
presumption.
now,
this
particular
individual
would
in
order
to
---
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well,
i
think
there
would
be
a
presumption
that
an
individual
who
has
been
granted
a
parole,
would
you
ever
think
he
could
to
sustain
that
parole
and
continue
it
in
order
that
he
may
maintain
the
conditional
liberty
that
at
parole
reflects.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
one-third
do
not,
one-third
do
valid
approach,
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
true.
finally,
we
do
not
feel
that
there
are
any
clatter
legal
consequences,
which
the
petitioner
can
show
that
would
indicate
that
he
would
be
adversely
affected
as
a
consequence
of
his
having
been
denied
parole
at
the
first
parole
consideration
hearing,
which
would
bring
him
within
the
preview
of
that
particularly
rule,
and
one
of
the
considerations
of
---
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
i
am
sorry
your
honor,
i
did
not
hear
you.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
you
mean
in
light
of
the
mootness
problem
here?
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
first
thing
to
then
is
to
try
and
attempt
in
every
possible
way
to
achieve
certification
of
the
class
at
some
point
in
time
prior
to
the
case
reaching
this
stage
in
the
litigation.
secondly,
secondly
he
could
have
as
many
co-plaintiffs
as
possible
in
the
suit
who
are
in
the
same
situation
he
felt
that
he
was
in,
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
case
would
survive.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
it
is
a
possibility,
he
could
have
asked
for
class
action
in
united
states
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
whether
they
would
had
certified
class.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well,
i
would
say
there
is
only
a
possibility
your
honor.
i
do
not
know
that
there
is
authority
that
would
sustain
that
position.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
no,
your
honor
i
do
not.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well,
your
honor
he
came
up
for
second
parole
consideration
hearing
as
a
matter
of
course
at
which
time
he
was
granted
the
parole,
which
he
desired
and
that
happened
just
prior
to
certification
being
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
being
valid
in
this
case.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well,
there
are
any
number
of
cases
that
have
been
before
this
court
your
honor
where
individuals,
whatever
action
was
coming
against
them,
they
considered
adversely
for
which
they
were
seeking
protection
or
relief
no
longer
existed
or
they
themselves
were
no
longer
in
preview.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well,
that
certainly
is
correct
justice
rehnquist
because
after
all
he
has
in
fact
being
granted
the
parole,
and
that
is
why
we
feel
he
no
longer
has
any
personal
interests
at
stake.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
we
believe
it
is
out,
we
do
not
believe
it
can
survive.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
no,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
if
i
were
counsel,
i
would
had
seen
to
it
that
very
many
of
them
would
have
joined
as
plaintiffs
together.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes,
your
honor
that
is
true.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
so
it
has
to,
in
any
class
action?
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well,
the
district
judge
would
have
granted
a
class
action
that
would
resolve
the
problem.
there
have
been
cases
in
other
circuits
where
the
judge
has
granted
class
action.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
i
do
not
know,
but
that
is
true
your
honor,
that
may
be,
but
i
do
not
know.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes,
your
honor
that
is
true.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes,
your
honor
that
is
true,
that
is
a
possibility.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
maybe
you
have
me
there.
if
they
had
not
granted
him
a
parole
then
he
could
possibly
have
sought
relief
in
state
courts,
but
he
was
granted
a
parole.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well,
for
the
same
reasons,
although
he
has
been
extended
relief,
we
do
not
believe
that
he
has
an
extended
parole,
that
he
is
entitled
to
any
relief
now
because
we
do
not
feel
he
has
any
personal
interest
at
stake.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
no,
he
did
not,
your
honor,
that
is
true.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes
sir,
but
that
would
lead
us
then
to
the
very
basic
nature
of
the
case
itself
in
parole
consideration,
which
i
think
i
shall
now
address
myself
to
that
---
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes,
your
honor
this
is
why
i
think
i
perhaps
now
should
address
myself
to
the
very
essence
of
the
case
on
the
merits.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
no
your
honor
he
did
not
ask
for
damages,
and
in
fact
i
do
not
believe
that
perusal
of
the
complaint
will
even
reveal
that
the
petitioner
himself
ever
alleged
that
he
was
entitled
to
be
paroled
at
that
first
hearing.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
that
would
be
a
possibility,
although
he
did
not
succeed
if
we
were
prosecuting
--
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
no,
your
honor,
i
believe
you
grant
specifically
request
damages,
it
is
a
possibility.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
we
would
now
turn
to
the
primary
issue
on
the
merits,
which
is
whether
the
due
process
calls
does
in
fact
attach
two
parole
consideration
hearings
in
kentucky
and
it
is
the
belief
of
the
respondents
that
it
does
not.
the
whole
predicate
upon
which
constitutional
application
in
support
to
due
process
clause
is
concerned
the
past
has
been
that
a
liberty
interest
or
property
interest
is
at
stake.
here
we
do
not
feel
that
there
is
either
a
liberty
or
a
property
interest
at
stake.
the
thrust
of
the
petitioner’s
argument
is
that
he
does
in
fact
have
an
interest
in
liberty.
we
believe
that
that
interest
in
liberty
has
been
effectively
extinguished
as
a
consequence
of
his
convictions
in
the
state
trial
courts
in
kentucky
for
robbery
and
armed
robbery
for
which
he
receives
ten
and
12
year
sentences
to
be
served
concurrently.
we
believe
that
as
a
consequence
of
this
conviction,
his
liberty
interest
no
longer
exists
within
the
sense
of
what
we
are
talking
about
here
within
the
context
of
this
case.
obviously,
the
fact
that
a
person
has
been
convicted
as
a
felon
and
sent
to
jail
does
not
mean
he
loses
all
his
constitutional
rights
and
we
certainly
are
not
saying
that.
we
are
saying
that
in
so
far
as
the
context
of
parole
consideration
is
concerned,
his
conviction
does
extinguish
his
liberty
interest.
furthermore,
we
do
not
feel
he
has
any
property
interest
at
stake.
an
examination
of
the
relevant
statutes
and
regulations
in
kentucky
will
reveal
that
there
is
no
entitlement
given
to
the
petitioner
in
so
far
as
parole
is
concerned.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well
now,
we
are
dealing
with
a
judge
type
situation.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
i
think
it
would
be
different
than
from
the
situation
we
have
here,
in
that
the
sentencing
process
has
ended
once
in
parole,
when
the
person
has
left
the
state
trial
court
level.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well,
perhaps
it
is
not
different
from
the
situation.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
i
think
perhaps
it
would
not
apply
in
that
kind
of
situation
coming
before
judge
who
has
complete
discretion
upon
a
statutory
entitlement
that
a
person
be
considered
after
he
serves
a
certain
amount
of
time
of
the
sentence.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
i
think
the
key
to
our
position
here
is
what
is
his
interest
here?
is
it
an
identifiable
interest
that
can
be
clothed
in
the
protections
of
the
due
process
clause?
is
it
one
of
liberty
or
is
it
one
of
property
and
we
do
not
think
it
is
either
one.
counsel,
mr.
rivkin
indicated
just
previously
that
his
case
does
not
depend
on
the
right
to
parole.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well,
that
is
an
expectation
and
so
far
as
the
petitioner
himself
is
concerned,
he
hopes
to
be
released.
he
has
a
valid
sentence
against
him
that
is
been
rendered
against
him.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well,
i
do
not
know
exactly
what
the
statistics
will
mean
because
in
statistics,
we
are
looking
at
the
end
result
and
in
order
to
build
up
those
statistics
to
begin
with,
the
parole
board
had
to
consider
each
case
on
a
case-to-case
basis
and
a
parole
consideration
itself
reflects
a
very
individualistic
treatment
of
each
person.
the
parole
board
has
an
identity
of
interest
with
a
prisoner.
if
he
can
possible
be
paroled,
they
will
want
him
to
be
paroled,
if
it
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
individual
and
the
society.
we
feel
that
there
must
be
a
predicate
for
due
process
application.
in
meacham
v.
fano
there
was
no
predicate
for
a
due
process
application.
there
has
to
be
a
liberty
or
property
interest
and
furthermore
we
think
it
not
only
has
to
be
a
liberty
or
property
interest,
but
has
to
be
a
liberty
or
property
interest
which
is
presently
being
enjoyed
by
the
person
who
seeks
protection
or
to
which
he
is
presently
entitled
to.
in
the
morrissey
case…
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
exactly,
he
has
to
be
deprived
of
it.
in
the
johnson
case
out
at
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals,
in
united
states
ex
rel.
johnson
vs.
new
york
parole
board.
in
that
case,
the
second
circuit
equated
the
expectation
of
parole
with
the
person’s
status
who
has
already
been
granted
parole
and
they
referred
in
there
to
a
footnote
8
in
the
morrissey
case,
referring
to
bay
vs.
connecticut
where
this
court,
mr.
chief
justice
burger
who
wrote
the
morrissey
opinion
and
used
that
footnote.
in
that
footnote
something
to
the
effect
that
it
is
not
being
sophistic
to
distinguish
between
a
mere
anticipation
or
hope
of
being
granted
parole
as
opposed
to
a
person
who
has
already
been
granted
parole
and
this
footnote
was
used
in
that
part
of
the
morrissey
decision
which
dealt
with
the
nature
of
the
interest
that
was
involved
not
to
some
weight
the
johnson
case
in
the
second
circuit
distinguished
that
footnote
by
saying
that,
it
makes
no
difference
whether
he
is
presently
enjoying
it
or
presently
entitled
to
it
because
all
that
footnote
means
is
that
the
supreme
court
indicated
that
more
constitutional
protections
could
be
accorded
to
somebody
who
is
already
on
parole
and
it
may
be
taken
away.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
i
am
not
exactly
sure
what
that
would
mean
other
than
the
fact
but
talking
with
all
respondents.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
i
do
not
know
that
it
is
necessary
to
know
what
exactly
what
“close
supervision”
would
be
because
this
is
the
status
somebody
whould
have
who
is
on
parole.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well,
we
have
talked
to
our
clients
about
“close
supervision”
about
the
aspects
of
this
case
in
the
individual
characteristics
of
scott
and
“close
supervision”
would
be
checking
him
with
parole
officers
being
limited
in
where
he
could
go
and
that
sort
of
thing,
but
no
we
do
not
know.
there
has
never
been
an
opportunity
by
the
respondents
to
set
forth
a
specific
factual
information,
which
is
really
pertinent
to
this
case.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
of
“close
supervision”
your
honor?
no,
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well,
i
believe
it
is
not
my
job.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes,
your
honor
because
those
kinds
of
considerations
deal
specifically
with
the
possible.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
i
do
not
think
that
those
considerations
would
be
relevant
to
the
consideration
of
mootness
to
determination
of
mootness,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
if
he
were
actually
back
in
the
prison
again?
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
anyone
who
is
on
parole,
there
is
always
some
limitations.
it
is
a
conditional
liberty
which
was
recognized
in
the
morrissey
case,
yes
your
honor.
finally,
we
would
say
that
the
court,
we
feel
should
give
consideration
to
whether
the
person
is
actually
enjoying
such
an
interest
or
is
entitled
to
such
an
interest.
an
expectation
we
feel
is
not
sufficient
to
extend
constitutional
due
process
protections
and
that
is
all
we
believe
that
the
petitioner
has…
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
yes,
your
honor.
in
so
far
as
that
case
is
concerned
and
perhaps
bar
cases
there
was
an
entitlement,
a
statutory
formal
policy
set
forth
in
which
it
established
a
class
and
if
someone…
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well,
i
think
it
was
a
rule
of
court
in
the
tax
case
because
it
would
be
the
court
of
tax
appeals
that
would
be
in
charge
of
permitting
people
to
come
before
you.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well,
it
may
have
been
your
honor,
but
now
if
someone
in
that
goldberg
case,
if
an
individual
fell
within
the
class
that
would
be
entitled
to
become
a
member
of
the
tax
court
bar
then
he
could
not
be
denied
relief
without
due
process
being
accorded
i
believe.
now,
the
thing
here
is,
the
state
of
kentucky
permits
someone
--
it
establishes
a
class
of
persons
who
may
be
considered
for
parole.
it
does
not
establish
by
policy
or
statute
to
regulation
that
class,
which
entitle
someone
to
parole.
i
believe
there
is
a
great
difference
in
that.
if
we
had
a
statute
which
said
that
a
person,
if
he
met
a,
b,
c,
d,
and
e
is
entitled
to
parole
then
we
could
not
deny
him
a
parole
once
he
establishes
that
he
meets
to
a,
b,
c,
d,
and
e.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
if
an
attorney
or
an
accountant
in
that
particular
case
fell
within
the
class
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
be
admitted
that
he
could
not
subsequently
be
denied
upon
the
discretionary
basis
without
a
due
process
hearing.
here
there
is
no
class
in
which
this
petitioner
or
any
other
prisoner
in
kentucky
would
fall
within
which
would
entitle
him
to
be
paroled.
if
there
were,
that
would
establish
an
entitlement
to
a
liberty
interest
and
here
there
is
no
such
entitlement
to
a
liberty
interest
or
a
property
interest
and
there
is
obviously
nothing
that
he
is
presently
enjoying
within
a
property
or
liberty
aspect.
we
would
now
turn
to
assuming
argument
that
due
process
does
in
fact
apply
to
this
case.
how
much
process
is
due?
we
would
first
suggest
a
possibility
of
a
remand
to
lower
courts
to
establish
an
evidentiary
basis,
in
order
to
determine
exactly
what
the
policies
and
practices
of
the
parole
board
are,
as
opposed
to
how
they
have
been
pleaded
in
this
particular
case.
in
the
event
this
court
does
not
deem
a
remand
necessary,
we
would
suggest
that
the
present
policies
and
practices
as
we
are
able
to
determine
them
now
are
sufficient
to
meet
with
minimal
due
process
standards,
after
all
the
entire
parole
board
meets
to
consider
a
parolee
at
a
parole
consideration
hearing.
if
they
cannot
all
meet,
of
course
a
quorum
will
meet
to
consider
the
individual.
he
has
right
to
be
present
and
he
has
the
right
to
be
heard.
the
parole
board
will
consider
under
present
regulation
some
14
specific
factors,
and
there
is
one
15th
factor
which
in
effect
permits
the
parole
board
to
consider
any
other
possibility.
we
feel
that
in
light
of
all
this,
the
risk
of
any
possible
error
is
at
best
minimal
and
a
chance
of
arbitrariness
minimal,
and
we
feel
that
these
minimal
due
process
protections
are
sufficient
to
accord
no
change
in
the
procedures
in
kentucky
at
this
time.
specifically,
as
to
some
of
the
requests
that
he
has
made
for
relief
and
so
far
as
an
attorney
is
concerned,
we
feel
that
the
introduction
of
counsel
at
a
parole
consideration
hearing
and
there
are
several
hundreds
of
these
held
every
year
by
the
parole
board
would
turn
the
hearing
into
a
truncated
trial
type
procedure
and
change
the
very
nature
and
form
of
the
consideration
in
role
of
the
board
into
almost
an
adversarial
type
process
and
we
do
not
feel
that
that
is
all
necessary
and
there
has
only
been
one
other
case
in
which
we
feel,
perhaps
in
goldberg
versus
kelly
where
the
right
to
counsel
has
been
extended
and
the
whole
indian
trial
procedure,
administrated
procedure
clothed
in
a
trial
type
proceeding.
we
do
not
feel
that
there
is
any
necessity
for
a
written
writ
list
of
reasons
is
the
actual
practice
in
most
cases
now
for
the
parole
board
to
extend
to
the
person
being
considered
in
all
reason
why
he
has
being
denied
parole,
we
feel
that
this
is
sufficient.
that
would
effectively
eliminate
that
particular
argument
we
feel
and
so
far
as
due
process
question
is
concerned
and
the
meaningful
hearing
and
opportunity
to
rebut
adverse
facts
we
feel
he
has
these
by
his
right
to
be
present
at
the
hearing
and
to
address
the
board
and
from
talking
with
the
respondents
is
their
position
at
any
time
that
they
feel
there
is
some
problem
in
the
record
in
so
far
as
possibly
granting
for
a
particular
person
at
parole,
they
would
discuss
it
with
him
at
the
hearing
and
we
feel
that
this
is
a
sufficiently
meaningful
hearing
in
so
far
as
minimal
due
process
is
concerned.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
well,
he
has
an
entitlement.
if
under
our
rules
and
regulations
of
statutes
he
was
never
accorded
a
hearing,
he
would
be
entitled
i
believe
to
pursue
a
relief
in
state
circuit
courts
for
the
reason
that
he
has
under
our
statutes
and
regulations
and
entitlement
to
be
considered
on
the
basis
of
whatever
his
sentence
may
be
after
a
certain
service
of
that
sentence
to
be
considered
for
parole
and
if
that
would
not
be
extended
to
him,
that
entitlement
we
feel
could
be
protected
by
going
into
the
state
circuit
courts
in
order
to
seek
relief
and
so
the
circuit
court
could
order
the
kentucky
parole
board
to
consider
him
for
parole
if
in
fact
no
hearing
was
ever
held
at
all.
mr.
patrick
b.
kimberlin
iii
essentially,
the
idea,
yes
your
honor
that
would
be
true.
in
conclusion
we
would
submit
that
the
due
process
clause
does
no
attach
to
parole
consideration
hearings
in
kentucky
and
that
if
it
does,
the
current
procedures
do
comport
properly
with
the
minimal
aspects
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
