mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit,
which
rejected
a
claim
by
kentucky
prisoners
that
the
state
parole
board
be
required
to
abide
by
the
minimum
guarantee
of
procedural
due
process
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
release
prisoners
on
parole.
specifically
the
issue
is
two
fold.
first,
whether
the
decision
to
grant
or
deny
parole
implicates
an
interest
in
liberty,
protected
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
secondly,
if
the
parole
function
is
accorded
to
constitutional
protection,
what
are
the
minimum
safeguards
that
apply?
before
addressing
these
questions,
i
will
discuss
briefly,
the
threshold
question
of
mootness,
whose
consideration
has
been
deferred
until
this
hearing.
the
state
has
suggested
that
the
release
on
parole
of
the
name
petitioner
has
mooted
this
action.
it
is
our
position
that
this
occurrence
has
not
deprived
this
action
of
the
necessary
adversariness
or
by
present
vitality
under
article
3.
three
grounds
support
our
view.
first,
we
believe
that
this
is
a
case
capable
of
repetition
between
the
parties,
yet
awaiting
the
plenary
review
of
this
court.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
in
this
case
your
honor,
the
petitioner
scott
is
on
parole
until
1984.
he
is
also
required
to
abide
by
a
number
of
stringent
conditions
on
his
liberty.
in
bradford,
the
petitioner
was
totally
released
from
any
restrictions
by
the
state
on
parole.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
when
the
case
was
here
and
the
decision
was
rendered
mooting
the
case,
the
petitioner
bradford
was
off
parole.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
yes,
he
had
served
his
full
sentence,
that
is
right.
secondly,
this
is
a
paradigm
of
a
case
which
has
awaited
plenary
review
of
this
court.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
yes.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
yes,
he
would,
during
that,
that
is
right,
but
he
would
be
returned…
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
under
the
terms
of
morrissey,
that
is
right.
he
would
be
returned
to
the
institution,
however,
and
would
likely
be
eligible
for
parole
after
a
number
of
years
again.
as
i
say
his
parole
last
until
1984.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
this
sentence,
that
is
right,
excuse
me.
secondly,
this
is
a
case,
a
case
which
has
awaited
the
plenary
review
of
this
court
in
three
other
instances,
in
scarpa
versus
board
of
parole,
johnson
versus
new
york
board
of
parole
and
bradford
versus
weinstein.
the
precise
issue
presented
here
has
been
mooted.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
that
is
right.
they
are
one
of
our
three
grounds,
your
honor.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
that
is
right.
those
are
the
two
prongs…
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
secondly,
we
believe
that
this
case
should
be
treated
and
maintained
as
a
class
action.
it
was
commenced
as
a
class
action,
but
the
district
court
did
not
permit
the
complaint
to
be
filed
in
form
of
corpus
and
dismissed
the
case
although
it
never
was
officially
filed
with
the
court.
it
only
became
a
formal
case
with
a
number
when
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
granted
a
motion
to
proceed
in
form
of
(inaudible).
we
believe
that
the
district
judge
in
essence
precluded
our
moving
for
certification
in
this
case.
secondly,
there
is
no
question
that
there
is
a
live
controversy
here
between
the
members
of
the
class,
the
purported
class,
the
prisoners
of
kentucky
and
the
parole
board.
finally,
under
the
intention
of
rule
23,
there
are
a
number
of
lower
court
cases
supporting
the
proposition
that
the
justice
ability
of
the
case
is
not
affected
when
the
name
petitioner
or
the
name
plaintiff
is
mooted
or
the
situation
of
the
name
plaintiff
is
mooted.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
if,
regardless
of
formal
certification
these
cases
hold
and
they
permit
intervention
and
that
is
my
third
point.
we
have
made
a
motion
to
substitute
name
petitioners
here
and
in
the
alternative
to
intervene
and
we
believe
that
in
the
interest
of
judicial
economy
and
in
the
important
interest
of
resolving
this
issue,
which
has
come
to
this
court
four
times.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
no,
in
the
court
of
appeals
the
name
petitioner
scott
was
still
in
prison,
he
had
not
been
paroled
yet.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
no,
we
did
not
move
that
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
there
was
no
necessity
to
have
it
then
your
honor.
the
petitioner
scott
was
in
prison.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
i
would
like
to
think
so.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
we
chose
out
of
ten
or
twelve
individuals,
we
chose
two
whose
statements
seem
to
us
representative
or
most
representative
of
the
class
with
the
best
factual
situations.
in
retrospect,
perhaps
we
should
have
included
a
large
number.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor.
at
the
time
it
was
a
live
controversy.
there
was
no
question
of
that
mootness
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
only
question
that
came
here…
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
the
certification
of
the
class
i
believe
would
have
dispelled
any
mootness.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
i
believe
they
could
have,
but
we
found
no
reason
to,
i
am
afraid,
that
the
case
was
a
live
controversy,
scott
was
in
prison
and
there
was
just
no
necessity
to
do
that.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
that
is
right,
we
would
have
moved
for
rule
23
certification.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
we
did
not,
no.
and
i
am
not
sure
whether
the
court
of
appeals
could
have
done
it
at
all
under
the
federal
rules.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
that
is
right,
so
did
the
district
judge,
your
honor,
and
i
think,
they
in
fact
treated
it
as
a
class
action.
turning
to
the
merits,
the
initial
inquiry
as
established
by
the
cases
is
into
the
nature
of
the
interest
at
stake
in
the
parole
decision.
an
understanding
of
the
paroling
process
will
show
that
this
interest
has
ample
substance
to
be
embraced
within
the
concept
of
liberty,
protected
by
the
due
process
clause
of
fourteenth
amendment.
parole
is
a
statutory
creation
of
the
state
and
is
an
integral
part
of
the
sentencing
apparatus
of
the
state.
when
an
individual
is
sentenced,
it
is
contemplated
by
the
legislature,
by
the
sentencing
judge,
by
prison
administrators
and
by
the
parole
board
that
most
prisoners
will
spend
part
of
their
time
in
incarceration
and
part
of
their
on
the
streets
on
parole.
among
the
critical
decisions
made
about
an
individual
involved
in
the
criminal
justice
system,
the
parole
decision
is
one
of
the
most
important.
from
arrest
to
conviction
to
sentencing
to
imprison
deprivations,
to
parole
revocation,
one
of
the
major
concerns
of
the
system
is
the
length
of
incarceration
that
an
individual
will
serve.
this
concern
is
magnified
in
the
parole
decision,
which
unlike
the
other
decisions,
points
that
i
have
mentioned
is
not
according
constitutional
protection
or
due
process
protection
of
any
kind.
this
conception
of
parole
as
an
integral
part
of
the
system
of
government
decision
making,
determining
the
length
of
incarceration
of
an
individual
is
often
obscured
by
another
notion
of
parole
as
simply
another
form
of
correctional
treatment
that
is
left
to
the
unbridle
discretion
of
experts
who
primarily
are
involved
in
predicting
recidivism.
however,
common
this
conception
was
in
days
when
parole
was
considered
charity
or
a
gift
or
a
grace,
it
has
not
and
cannot
withstand
present
day
scrutiny.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
yes,
i
do.
if
the
state
abandons
a
parole
system
and
modifies
its
sentencing
system
which
it
would
have
to
do,
this
case
would
not
be
here.
this
case
does
not
involve
the
constitutional
right
to
parole,
and
only
fair
consideration
in
the
process
of
determining
parole.
today,
it
is
commonly
accepted
that
the
parole
decision
is
based
on
a
variety
of
factors
unrelated
to
the
predictive
ability
of
the
board.
some
of
these
considerations
are
the
past
history
of
an
individual,
the
offense
the
individual
committed,
the
person’s
institutional
record,
the
prison
population
capacities
in
a
particular
state
and
others.
to
the
extent
that
these
factors
enter
the
parole
decision
which
they
most
certainly
do,
the
absolute
claim
of
expertise
suggested
by
the
state
on
behalf
of
the
board
carries
less
force.
our
opponents
probably
would
concede
that
a
variety
of
factors
enter
into
the
decision
making
process
of
the
board,
but
they
claim
that
the
board
has
unfettered
discretion
to
weigh
these
factors
in
any
fashion
that
they
will.
i
think
a
look
at
the
kentucky
system
will
reveal
that
the
board’s
discretion
is
not
as
uncaving
as
the
state
suggests.
kentucky
has
created
a
scheme
of
conditional
release,
where
prisoners
spend
part
of
their
time
in
prison
and
part
of
their
time
outside
on
conditional
release.
the
system
is
administered
by
a
board
composed
of
professional
decision
makers,
who
make
upwards
of
1000
decisions
per
year.
although
this
board
is
within
the
state
department
of
corrections
and
relies
on
the
state
department
of
corrections
for
information,
it
is
a
statutory
creature
of
its
own
within
the
sentencing
apparatus
and
contemplated
to
be
within
the
sentencing
apparatus
of
the
state.
by
statue,
the
board
is
required
to
abide
by
certain
ground
rules
which
evidence
the
legislature’s
concern,
the
kentucky
legislature’s
concern
with
fair
and
complete
consideration
in
the
parole
process.
the
board
is
required,
mandated
by
statute
to
amass
a
good
deal
of
information
on
an
individual
and
it
is
allowed
to
call
on
the
resources
of
the
department
of
corrections,
the
state
police
and
others
to
gather
this
information.
secondly,
the
board
is
required
by
statute
to
study
the
case
history
or
the
record
of
the
individual.
thirdly,
the
board
is
required
to
deliberate
on
that
record
and
fourth,
to
conduct
a
hearing
which
it
does,
often
lasting
five
to
ten
minutes
at
the
most
and
fifth,
because
the
board
is
composed
of
five
members,
it
is
also
required
to
engage
in
some,
sort
of,
collegial
decision
making,
it
is
not
one
individual.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
the
hearing
is
attended
by
normally
all
members
of
parole
board
and
the
prisoner.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
that
is
all,
yes.
finally,
the
board
has
been
requested
by
the
legislature
or
mandated
by
the
legislature
to
promulgate
regulations
governing
the
phases
of
its
operation.
i
believe
the
statue
says
in
accordance
with
prevailing
ideas
of
correction
and
reform.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
that
exist
in
i
think
three
states,
georgia,
north
carolina
and
one
other
state,
there
is
no
hearing
at
all
required.
the
hearing
here
of
course
is
rather
short
and
what
goes
on
inside,
nobody
is
really
quite
sure,
but
if
a
legislature
wants
to
do
that,
we
do
not
think
that
that
comports
with
minimum
due
process
of
course,
if
a
legislature
want
to
do
that.
we
believe
the
hearing
is
an
integral
element
of
the
process
that
is
due.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
a
meaningful
hearing,
a
hearing
in
which
the
individual
is
given
an
opportunity
to
present
evidence,
a
statement,
a
meeting
whatever
adverse
evidence
is
in
the
file
against
the
individual.
very
often
and
may
be
for
instance,
letters
from
people
in
the
community,
who
this
person,
the
prisoner
has
no
idea
who
they
are
or
why
they
are
writing
these
letters.
this
chance
to
have
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
meet
this
evidence
is
one
of
the
ingredients
of
the
hearing
that
we
are
requesting.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
we
believe
that
assistance
by
an
advocate,
whether
an
attorney
or
a
lay
advocate
would
be
essential.
the
federal
system
allows
a
person’s
minister,
a
person’s
spouse,
a
member
of
the
person’s
family
to
come
in.
this
hearing
is
structured
and
we
believe
it
can
be
structured
to
provide
for
a
short
presentation
and
according
to
some
of
the
preliminary
data
that
is
coming
out
of
those
hearings,
the
assistance
of
an
advocate
is
quite
helpful.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
we
also
believe
that
that
is
one
of
the
ingredients
of
due
process.
one
of
the…
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
before
the
actual
hearing.
once
again,
this
is
also
provided
by
the
us
board
of
parole
and
this
meets
the
substantial
documentation
of
the
errors
that
are
contained
in
parole
files.
in
fact,
the
kentucky
parole
board
was
recently
scrutinized
by
a
blue
ribbon
commission,
a
commission
by
the
governor
of
kentucky
and
they
found
a
file
keeping
sloppy,
they
found
mistakes
and
they
criticized
it
quite
severely
and
for
this
reason,
we
believe
that
access
to
the
file
is
important.
it
would
not
provide
much
hardship
for
the
state
to
do
that
either
since
there
are
two
files
as
i
understand
that
they
maintain,
one
at
the
prison,
where
the
individual
is
and
one
in
a
central
office
where
the
parole
board
meets.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
i
plan
to
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
that
is
right.
those
are
the
criteria,
the
minimum
criteria
that
we
believe
are
required
in
the
process.
in
terms
of
channeling
the
discretion
of
the
board,
the
board
itself
has
promulgated
15
criteria
that
it
looks
at.
the
board
has
also
built
up
a
body
of
precedents
in
the
numbers,
the
vast
numbers
of
decisions
that
they
make
each
year.
as
i
say
these
are
professional
decision
makers.
they
make
decisions
according
to
precedents
and
criteria.
they
have
listed
the
fifteen
criteria
and
we
believe
that
if
an
individual
prisoner
and
his
or
her
record
makes
an
adequate
showing
before
this
board
that
parole
will
likely
assume.
finally,
the
statistics,
nationwide
and
in
kentucky,
show
that
most
individuals
are
paroled.
this
underscores
the
importance,
indeed
the
necessity
of
parole
in
a
sentencing
apparatus
of
a
state
and
demonstrates
that
a
prisoner
will
in
fact
be
paroled
upon
an
adequate
showing
under
the
criteria
that
the
board
considers.
the
notion
that
the
board
has
unlimited
discretion
and
could
not
for
instance
parole
any
prisoner
just
does
not
comport
with
the
reality
of
the
system.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
that
is
right
your
honor.
it
is
directed…
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
we
think
that
the
notion
of
deprivation
in
this
instance
is
met
both
under
the
cases
of
this
court
and
the
realities
of
the
system.
under
the
cases
of
this
court,
the
notion
that
a
person
must
be
vested,
and
therefore,
deprived
of
the
right
has
not
found
total
voice.
only
last
term,
in
the
hampton’s
case,
hampton
versus
mow
sun
wong,
the
alien
civil
service
case,
the
court
clothed
individuals
who
were
seeking
federal
jobs
with
the
mantle
of
due
process
protection.
similarly,
in
willner
versus
board
of
bar
examiners
and
schware
versus
board
of
bar
examiners
and
goldsmith
versus
board
of
tax
appeals,
the
court
did
not
make
the
distinction
between
an
individual
who
has
and
possesses
a
benefit
and
one
who
is
only
applying
and
in
fact,
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
solicitor
general
in
his
footnote
23,
he
seems
to
concede
that
an
applicant
for
benefits,
he
mentions
unemployment
compensation
benefits
that
an
applicant
for
those
benefits
will
in
fact
be
clothed
with
due
process
protection.
under
the
realities
of
the
system,
if
an
individual
is
not
paroled,
based
on
perhaps
erroneous
information
in
the
file
or
illegitimate
criteria,
as
is
contemplated
under
the
sentencing
apparatus
and
by
the
sentencing
judge,
everyday
that
that
person
stays
in
parole,
he
or
she
is
being
deprived
of
an
interest
in
liberty.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
there
is
review
available
in
the
kentucky
courts.
there
have
been
a
couple
of
decisions
in
the
60s
by
the
high
court
in
kentucky
indicating
that
the
court
would
review
the
parole
decision
on
an
abuse
of
the
discretion
standard.
they
have
never
reviewed
one
successfully
on
behalf
of
a
prisoner,
but
my
understanding
of
those
cases
is
that
if
for
instance,
an
individual
were
not
paroled
and
could
show
that
it
was
done
on
a
racially
illegitimate
basis,
the
kentucky
court
would
review
otherwise
the
discretion
is
rather
board.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
the
court
has
indicated
on
one
occasion
that
it
would
review
for
abuse
of
discretion.
however,
as
i
noted,
it
has
never
successfully
reviewed
once,
first
of
all.
secondly,
i
think
it
shows
that
the
court
recognizes
that
there
is
a
palpable
interest
here.
by
the
very
fact
of
judicial
review
indicates
that
there
is
something
here,
not
the
ephemeral
kind
of
interest
that
the
state
suggests,
but
something
quite
important
and
to
be
protected.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
no,
it
was
solely
on
and
it
sounded
in
administrative
law
in
the
same.
there
was
only
one
decision
that
i
could
find
like
that
and
in
that
decision
of
course,
the
court
did
talk
about
the
parole
as
grace,
it
was
a
pre-morrissey
decision
and
that
was
the
only
decision
i
have
been
able
to
find
on
that
point,
but
i
think
the
existence
of
review
is
a
recognition
by
the
state
courts
of
kentucky
that
parole
is
a
substantial
interest.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
no,
morrissey
rejected
the
characterization
of
parole
as
grace.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
that
is
right
that
was
the
holding
of
morrissey.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
it
is
a
matter
of
discretion.
i
think
it
more
properly
characterized
it,
the
notion
of
grace,
i
think
goes
into
the
notion
of
parole
as
a
privilege
which
the
court
rejected
in
morrissey,
the
characterization
of
the
process
as
a
privilege.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
i
believe
it
explicitly
said
that
we
reject
the
characterization
of
parole
as
either
a
right
or
a
privilege,
and
we
will
look
on
it
as
liberty
that
is
valuable
to
be
protected
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
that
is
right,
and
i
think
your
honor’s
question
fits
in
directly
with
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question
concerning
whether
an
applicant
for
a
benefit
as
opposed
to
one
who
retains
a
benefit
is
entitled
to
due
process
protection,
and
i
believe
under
the
cases
of
this
court,
as
well
as
under
the
notion
that
an
individual
who
is
not
paroled
could
conceivably
be
characterized
as
being
deprived
of
his/her
liberty,
if
parole
is
not
granted
as
contemplated
under
the
system,
that
for
those
reasons,
we
believe
that
the
application
of
parole
was
under
due
process
protection.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
that
is
right,
there
are
60%
of
the
individuals
who
are
in
prison
are
released
on
parole
and
of
those
60%,
68%
are
paroled
the
first
time
they
appear
before
the
board,
and
those
are
statistics
from
72
or
74
approximately.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
with
parole
viewed
in
the
context
above,
the
nature
of
the
interest
at
stake
becomes
apparent.
it
is
not
in
an
ephemeral,
unilateral
interest
or
desired,
but
rather
a
claim
to
freedom,
legitimized
by
the
legislature,
by
the
sentencing
apparatus,
by
prison
administrators,
and
by
the
parole
board
itself.
to
characterize
parole
is
nothing
more
than
a
mere
hope
or
anticipation
misconceives
the
dynamics
of
the
system
and
the
understandings
that
shape
it.
the
court
has
recognized
the
palpability
of
a
prisoner’s
interest
in
morrissey
versus
brewer.
i
think
that
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
morrissey
versus
brewer
the
decision-making
process
that
goes
on
revocation
is
very
similar
to,
if
not
exactly
similar
to
the
decision-making
process
that
goes
on
in
parole
release.
first
as
the
court’s
opinion
noted,
the
board
ascertains
certain
facts
about
the
individual.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
the
hearing
back
at
the
institution,
the
second
hearing,
the
board
first
must
ascertain
certain
facts
just
as
it
does
in
parole
release.
second,
and
as
the
court
noted,
the
more
complex
decision
and
the
discretionary
decision
is
the
decision
as
to
whether
those
facts
justify
in
that
instance
returning
the
individual
to
prison,
in
our
instance
whether
the
person
should
be
released
on
the
street,
and
it
is
that
discretionary
decision
and
the
discretionary
decision
making
that
are
here,
in
both
of
those
processes
that
are
the
same.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
the
prisoner,
i
believe
normally
would
be
incarcerated
during
that
period.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
that
is
right.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
that
is
right.
it
has
not
formally
been
revoked
until
the
board
does
so
at
the
second
final
hearing,
that
is
not
this
case
of
course.
following
morrissey,
the
majority
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
upheld
the
position
we
urge
today,
cognizant
of
the
evolving
approach
to
due
process
contained
in
some
of
the
more
recent
decisions
of
this
more
recent
decisions
of
this
court
including
(inaudible).
under
this
approach,
if
a
person
is
able
to
assert
a
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement
to
a
government
benefit,
due
process
ensues.
in
parole,
such
a
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement
is
a
product
of
the
practices
and
understandings
that
have
grown
out
of
the
system
of
rules
that
govern
the
parole
system.
very
much
like
in
perry
versus
sindermann
where
there
was
a
de
facto
system
of
teacher
tenure,
an
unwritten
common
law
of
parole
also
exists.
this
unwritten
common
law
generates
a
substantial
claim
that
if
a
prisoner
meets
certain
criteria
or
conditions,
parole
will
be
granted.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
i
think
the
difference
between
meachum
and
this
case
is
two
or
three
fold.
first
of
all
in
meachum,
the
state
had
not
created
any,
sort
of,
apparatus
or
system
or
statute
governing
classifications
in
prison,
whereas
in
the
parole
situation,
the
state
has
created
the
parole
apparatus
as
an
integral
part
of
the
sentencing
apparatus.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
no,
the
state
has
not
said
that,
but
in
fact
that
is
what
happens.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
it
is
a
practice.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor.
i
think
the
distinction
is
between
the
intention
of
the
state
in
creating
a
system
of
classification
and
the
discretion
invested,
which
is
vastly
different
in
the
classification
situation
where
the
state
has
not
spoken
nor
has
the
prison
administrator
spoken,
whereas
here
not
only
the
legislature
had
spoken,
not
only
the
sentencing
judge
has
intended,
but
the
board
itself
is
promulgated
certain
criteria.
the
measure
of
discretion
here,
i
believe
is
much
more
bounded.
secondly,
i
believe
also
that
the
nature
of
the
interest
involved
in
meachum
is
not
the,
kind
of
classic,
fundamental,
bedrock
interest
in
freedom
that
parole
involves.
the
notion
of
intrastate
transfer
i
believe
is
of
a
different
order,
and
should
be
treated
so
by
the
court.
thirdly,
meachum
also
involved
considerations
of
internal
prison
security,
which
are
not
at
all
in
the
picture
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to…
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
exactly,
your
honor.
claimant
entitlement
is
exactly
similar.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
please.
mr.
dean
hill
rivkin
just
a
few
points
your
honor.
i
believe
that
general
kimberlin
stated
our
case
when
he
noted
in
response
to
questions
about
goldsmith
that
an
individual
or
if
an
individual
becomes
a
member
of
the
class
then
he
or
she
is
entitled
to
due
process
protection.
i
think
that
is
precisely
the
nature
of
the
process
of
parole
release.
the
board,
exercising
discretion,
uses
the
criteria
that
it
has
developed
over
the
years.
it
reviews
the
files
as
the
statistics
to
know
a
large
number
of
individuals
meet
those
criteria
and
in
fact
are
paroled.
this
is
much
closer
to
the
sentencing
analogy
that
mr.
justice
stevens
noted
and
to
the
type
of
discretion
that
was
exercised
in
morrissey
versus
brewer
and
the
type
of
process
that
existed
in
morrissey
versus
brewer
and
for
instance
in
meachum
versus
fano.
parole
release
is
part
of
this
continuum
in
the
criminal
justice
process,
involving
the
important
interest
of
release
on
parole
as
opposed
to
whatever
interest
an
individual
would
have
which
is
not
constitutionally
protected
under
meachum
versus
fano.
finally,
i
think
that
the
reading
of
depravation
under
the
due
process
clause
to
exclude
this
case
would
be
an
overly
formalistic
reading
under
this
court’s
case
is
in
goldsmith
and
schware
and
wilner
and
alster
term
in
hampton
and
for
these
reasons
we
believe
that
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
should
be
reversed
and
the
case
remanded
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
further
proceedings.
