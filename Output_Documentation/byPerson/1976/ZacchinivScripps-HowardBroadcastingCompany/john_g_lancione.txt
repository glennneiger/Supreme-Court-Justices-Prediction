mr.
john
g.
lancione
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
john
lancione,
arguing
for
the
petitioner.
in
this
case,
we
are
here
by
virtue
of
the
question
involving
the
applicability
of
freedom
of
the
press
in
the
first
amendment
as
it
is
and
has
been
applied
to
the
right
of
publicity
as
expressed
by
the
ohio
state
supreme
court.
in
our
case,
a
public
performer,
a
man
who
has
an
act
known
as
the
human
cannonball
was
performing
at
a
local
fair
and
i
believe
the
critical
facts
in
this
case
revolved
around
the
--
the
way
the
news
media
ended
up
putting
his
performance
on
its
new
show.
and
that
is
a
news
paper
reporter,
a
freelance
reporter
went
to
the
fair
and
made
an
inquiry
of
mr.
zacchini
concerning
the
filming
of
his
act,
and
was
told
specifically
that
this
privilege
was
rejected
and
that
he
did
not
wish
his
act
to
be
filmed
by
the
reporter.
the
reporter
returned
and
spoke
to
the
news
manager
and
was
told
by
way
of
affidavit
to
go
out
and
film
the
act.
and
indeed,
he
did,
and
the
act
takes
15
seconds
for
mr.
zacchini
to
complete.
that
is
his
only
professional
show.
that
is
the
entirety
of
his
performance.
he's
shot
out
of
a
cannon
and
traveled
several
100
feet
in
the
air,
lands
in
a
net.
in
15
seconds,
that's
the
end
of
it.
it
is
dramatic.
it
is
unusual
and
that's
why
i
take
it
that
he's
been
able
to
sell
this
act
around
the
country
and
--
and
make
a
living.
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
in
response
to
our
motions,
stated
that
there
is
indeed
a
right
of
publicity
that
inheres
in
a
professional
entertainment's
--
entertainer's
act
that
he
has
a
property
right
to
govern
how,
when
and
where
his
performance
is
published.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
a
proprietary
interest
i
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
i
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
the
syllabus,
yes
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
yes
for
the
--
the
invasion
of
privacy
in
syllabus
one,
your
honor,
refers
to
the
benefit
of
the
name
and
likeness
of
another
being
--
is
subject
to
liability
to
the
other
for
invasion
of
his
privacy
and
then
they
refer
to
this
right
of
the
publicity
value
in
his
performance.
i
think,
in
the
language,
they
say
proprietary
interest
but
in
any
event,
it
is
a
substantial
right
that
an
individual
has.
a
private
individual
who
seeks
to
become
an
entertainer
and
they
say
that
this
right
of
publicity
inheres
in
his
performance.
now
then,
they
go,
they
take
a
step
further
and
in
the
third
syllabus,
they
say,
“the
first
amendment
however,
allows
the
press
to
report
in
a
newscast,
matters
of
legitimate
public
interest.”
mr.
john
g.
lancione
i
would
call
this
a
verbatim
reproduction.
they
went
in
with
a
tv
camera
and
they
filmed
everything
he
had
to
show.
the
--
the
only
reason
that
it
occurred,
i
would
suggest,
is
because
it
was
a
15-minute
act
and
he
specifically
rejected
their
proposal
to
put
it
on
their
new
show.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
yes
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
--
i
think
that
this
court
must
look
behind
the
bare
syllabus,
the
three
paragraphs
that
summarize
what
happened
and
--
and
determine
what
the
facts
were.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
yes
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
i
think
for
that
purpose,
that
is
true.
i
was
--
i
was
suggesting
that
to
determine
what
actually
happened
and
what
the
court
is
saying.
the
court
must
take
in
the
consideration
of
facts
but
i
think,
in
syllabus
three
is
what
we're
dealing
with.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
no,
that
is
not.the
only
--
the
only
binding
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
head
notes
are
not
the
law
of
the
case
in
ohio
but
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
no,
i
am
contending
that
it
is
a
property
right.i
believe
it
is.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
is
not.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
see
any
particular
significance
to
it.
i
think
that
they've
created
a
substantive
right,
a
tort
remedy,
the
invasion
of
the
right
of
publicity.
to
state
it
in
terms
of
property,
proprietary
or
realty,
i
don't
think
it's
the
intent
of
using
the
word
or
proprietary
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
yes.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
yes,
i
think
they
do
mean
that,
but
i
don't
think
they've
stated
it
as
specifically
in
the
supreme
court
syllabus.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
yes,
justice
marshall.
the
right
of
privacy
is
the
right
to
have
those
matters
kept
away
from
the
public
which
the
public
has
no
right
to
know
about.
for
example,
in
the
firestone
case,
i
believe
that
the
right
of
privacy
was
involved
because
the
reporter
cited
the
fact
that
a
counterclaim
had
been
dismissed
when
it
dealt
with
adultery
on
the
part
of
mary
alice
firestone.
and
it
also
has
the
right
of
--
privacy
prohibits
those
in
the
media
from
--
or
anyone
else
from
giving
a
false
light
to
facts
which
are
known
to
the
public,
where
the
right
of
publicity
is
almost
the
opposite.
an
entertainer
wants
to
be
in
front
of
the
public.
he
wants
to
be
publicized
and
advertised,
and
i'm
sure
mr.
zacchini
would
have
appreciated
the
fact
that
they
mentioned
on
their
show
or
showed
a
picture
of
him
and
said,
“hugo
zacchini
is
going
to
be
shot
out
of
a
cannon.”
i
mean,
he
probably
have
loved
to
have
channel
five
put
that
on
every
half
hour,
so
he
would
get
more
people
out
there
to
enhance
the
value
of
his
act.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
oh
yes,
yes
he
does.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
no
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
no
your
honor,
i
would
not
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
i
think
that
the
news
media
has
a
right
to
publicize
in
an
entertainment
section,
for
example.
they
can
--
they
can
advertise
to
the
public
that
there
is
an
entertainment
section
on
their
11
o'clock
news
show,
and
they
can
tell
about
everyone
of
imports
--
or
have
little
import
who
is
performing
in
and
about
the
area
where
there
are
readers
and
listeners
are
concerned
about.
but
what
we
have
here
is
the
taking
of
an
entire
total
performance.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
no,
i
do
not.
i
do
not
believe
that
they
--that
the
media
has
the
right
under
the
--
under
the
first
amendment
privileges
as
they
have
been
enunciated
and
interpreted
to
publish
--
to
capture
and
publish
a
performer's
entire
act.
i
think
that
is
protected.
his
act
in
its
entirety
becomes
his
peculiar
property
and
i
don't
think
that
under
any
circumstances,
unless
there
is
a
waiver,
which
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
declared
there
was
not,
that
the
news
media
can't
come
in
and
say,
“we
call
it
news
and
therefore,
we
can
do
whatever
we
want
to.”
mr.
john
g.
lancione
well,
if
it
was
a
private
matter
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
between
the
people
who
have
contracted
for
him
to
come
in
and
perform,
i
don't
think
we
are
dealing
with
that.
i
think
that
he
--
whatever
arrangement
he
makes,
he
may
waive
some
right
for
the
person
who
has
purchased
his
act.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
well,
i
think
that
if
it
did
say
that
and
it
probably,
there
was
probably
nothing
said
to
the
person
who
came
in
to
the
burton
--
the
geauga
county
fair
in
burton,
ohio.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
that's
right,
i
don't
think
the
news
media
can
come
in
under
the
guise
of
the
first
amendment
and
capture
any
performer's
complete
act,
unless
there
is
a
waiver.
there
may
be
a
waiver
in
the
circumstances
that
you're
discussing
if
the
--
if
the
performer
knows
that
there
will
be
persons
in
there
recording
his
performance.
he
may
be
held
away
but
news
programs
don't
--
only
take
15
minutes
or
half
an
hour.
some
programs
take
an
hour,
there
are
special
news
shows
and
the
--
and
the
thing
--
the
point
it
puts
this
in
appalling
perspective
is
that
anytime
the
news
media
calls
it
news,
under
the
third
syllabus,
they
are
granted
an
indefeasible
immunity
and
privilege.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
well,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
no,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
the
question
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
ohio
tort
law
like
anything
else.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
if
there
was
no
interpretation
of
the
first
amendment
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
--
i
would
not
be
here.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
we
are
permitted,
mr.
justice
white,
to
look
into
the
body
of
the
decisions
to
interpret
the
syllabus
of
the
case.
and
on
page
813,
the
court
clearly
states
that
the
effect
of
this
holding
and
that
of
new
york
versus
sullivan
is
that
the
press
has
a
privilege
to
report
matters
of
legitimate
public
interest
even
through
such
reports
might
intrude
on
matters
otherwise
private
and
then
they
go
on.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
pardon.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
yes
your
honor,
yes
it
does.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
then
it
goes
on
to
analogize
the
reasoning
and
to
say
that
the
rights
is
enunciated
which
gave
privilege
of
freedom
of
speech,
freedom
of
the
press,
freedom
to
speak
out
on
issues
that
are
public.
and
in
the
decent
in
the
gertz
case,
it
was
pointed
out,
i
believe
by
mr.
justice
white
that
he
would
have
found
differently
because
there
was
--
this
was
a
comment
upon
a
judicial
proceeding
so
that
--
all
of
the
privilege
that
has
been
granted
has
been
granted
so
far
to
expression,
first
of
all,
about
public
officials.
and
then
in
hill,
about
an
event
of
public
interest,
which
is
the
opening
of
a
new
play
then
we
go
to
the
butts
case,
involving
a
football
coach
and
the
general
walkers
speaking
out
on
public
issues.
this
bears
no
resemblance,
i
submit,
to
a
matter
like
we
have
here.
this
is
a
private
individual,
a
private
citizen
who
has
certainly
subjected
himself
to
criticism
by
the
press.
i
think
that
he
stands
in
the
same
shoes
as
general
walker
or
any
other
entertainer.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think,
your
honor,
that
this
would
have
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
yes,
this
is
--
this
is
a
tort
created
by
--
as
a
common
law
right
in
ohio.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
well,
if
i
think,
we
would
be
in
exact
same
position
we
are
now
and
that
is
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
i
think
there
would
be.
i
think
there
would
be,
your
honor,
because
behind
that
syllabus,
syllabus
two
and
three,
still
lies
the
facts
and
circumstances
and
the
reasoning,
the
expressed
reasoning
of
the
court.
we
can't
reject
that.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
i
think
if
they
--
if
there
was
a
--
no
reliance
whatever
on
the
first
amendment,
then
we
wouldn't
have
the
question
that
we
have
here
and
that's
exactly
what
you
have
in
gertz
on
page
330
of
the
opinion
in
gertz.
they
said,
this
case
is
here
because
the
petitioner
contests
the
applicability
of
the
first
amendment
to
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
--
of
mr.
gertz.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
yes
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
yes,
as
part
of
the
opinion
your
honor,
yes,
we
may.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
i
feel
that.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
i
don't
know
that
for
a
fact,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
well,
i'm
sure
that
he
does.
in
fact,
as
a
legal
proposition,
he
does,
whether
he
does
--
whether
he
has
some
program
for
that,
i
don't
know.
but
i
think
that
it
would
be
the
very
same
situation
if
on
a
program
on
fine
arts,
the
media
would
go
into
the
concert
hall
and
tape
the
eight
symphonies
which
beethoven's
eight
symphony
doesn't
take
more
than
a
half
an
hour
and
play
the
entire
symphony.
now,
the
difference
is
our
case
is
stronger
because
hugo
zacchini
only
has
one
performance.
he
doesn't
play
any
different
tune
like
a
violinist.
he
has
one
15-second
act
and
they
have
captured
that,
and
they
have
captured
that
with
his
--
over
his
specific
objection
which
i
think
is
very
important.
now,
it
has
been
stated
that
this
is
a
limited
privilege
but
under
the
--
under
the
statement
made
in
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
there
was
an
affidavit
in
the
--
a
freelancing
tv
photographer
came
out
and
asked
him
if
he
could
film
his
act
and
mr.
zacchini
said
no.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
before
he
did
it,
and
then
the
reporter
went
back
and
discussed
this
with
his
superiors
and
his
superiors
apparently
said
or
the
affidavit
states
in
substance
to
go
back
and
do
it
and
he
did
surreptitiously
do
that.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
yes,
but
he
did
it
at
this
time
without
permission
and
over
the
specific
objections
that
i
mean
that
he
did
not
get
his
permission
when
went
back
again.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
that's
right.
i
think
it's
the
same
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
i
just
pointed
out
that
the
objection
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
i
think
it
makes
a
stronger
case
because
the
right
as
--
it
may
be
defined
--
the
right
of
the
press,
as
it
may
be
defined
is
to
act
in
a
reasonable
and
responsible
fashion
in
fulfilling
their
obligation
to
report
news.
i
think
when
you
can
establish
that
they
go
beyond
that.
now
here,
i
do
want
to
point
out
in
the
third
syllabus,
this
is
described
as
a
limited
privilege,
i
don't
think
it
is.
they
have
the
right
to
report
in
their
newscasts,
matters
otherwise
privileged
unless
it's
for
a
non-privileged
use.
but
once
you
establish
it
is
on
a
news
program,
it
cannot
be
for
a
non-news
use
and
therefore
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
the
ohio
supreme
court
would
not
have
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
well,
i
think
if
it
was
outside
of
a
news
showing,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
may
very
well
have
come
to
a
different
conclusion,
but
what
they
have
said
relates
to
news
programs
as
i
read
the
third
syllabus.
and
that
the
only
exception
is
when
it
is
a
non-news
use,
which
seems
to
me
to
be
a
non-sequitur.
you
can't
have
--
you
can't
fit
in
to
the
right
that
the
press
gets
under
the
first
amendment
by
the
supreme
court
by
putting
on
your
news
if
it's
a
non-news
use.
in
other
words
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
at
the
burton
county,
at
the
burton
fair,
yes,
he
did
your
honor,
but
i
just
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
that's
right,
there
is
no
factual
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
that's
right
--
and
the
other
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
i
presume
he
was
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
i
don't
think
that
you
would
be
able
to
establish
any
damages
under
ohio
law
because
he
would
have
no
commercial
value
if
he
did
not
perform
as
a
professional
entertainer.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
that's
correct
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
yes
it
is.
he
--
he
is
a
professional
entertainer
and
that's
to
whom
the
right
applies.
the
right
of
publicity
applies
to
an
entertainer
or
to
a
professional
athlete
if
anyone
who
has
developed
some
commercial
value
in
the
use
of
their
name
and
their
image
and
their
success.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
if
he
voluntarily
performed
in
front
of
the
tv
cameras
and
knew
that
he
was
going
to
be
put
on
the
program,
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
different
factual
situation.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
because
he
would
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
i
--
i
don't
think
they
could
film
his
entire
act.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
it's
different
than
doing
it
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
it's
different
than
doing
it
in
his
front
yard,
if
he
was
doing
it
as
a
commercial
act
and
tv
cameras
were
there.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
no,
i
don't
think
they
could
publish
his
entire
act
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
yes,
i
think
that
that
would
be
an
exception
because
--
the
difference
is,
that
it's
not
his
performance
anymore,
mr.
justice
marshall.
it
is
then
an
untoward
event.
as
the
event
that
i
suggest
in
my
brief
where
he
would
miss
the
net
and
break
his
legs,
then
i
think
it
becomes
something
different
than
his
--
his
professionals
act.
it
is
no
longer
his
professional
act
because
something
untoward
has
occurred.
so,
i
think
that
that's
a
different
situation.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
i'm
sorry,
page
a
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
a15.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
now,
i
take
it
that
they're
referring
to
the
fact
that
if
there
was
a
contract
between
mr.
zacchini
and
the
persons
who
hired
him
that
he
--
his
act
was
not
to
be
filmed,
that
it
would
--
it
would
raise
a
different
question
but
that's
not
the
question
raised
here.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
to
--
to
film
his
entire
act,
i
believe
he
would
have
to
give
permission.
he
would
have
to
give
them
permission.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
that's
especially
necessary
to
his
case,
i
would
think.
the
other
point
i
wanted
to
make
about
the
limited,
so-called
limited
privilege
was
that
they
have
accepted
a
news
media
presentation
with
actual
intent
to
harm
and
i
think
that
that
is
also
without
--
without
any
effect
because
in
this
case,
there
was
specific
objection
and
they
put
his
act
on
anyhow
and
therefore,
i
don't
--
mr.
john
g.
lancione
yes,
they
did.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
yes,
they
did.
but
i
don't
know
how
the
court
could
ever
expect
anyone
to
establish
intent
to
harm
if
intent
to
harm
is
not
established
by
the
newspaper,
news
media
people
putting
this
on
their
show
after
he
has
objected.
now,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
the
standards,
as
they
have
been
enumerated
in
--
in
time,
in
new
york
times
and
hill
and
further
in
--
in
gertz,
especially
and
in
firestone,
should
not
be
applied
to
the
right
of
publicity.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
logic
to
it.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
similarity
to
capturing
an
entire
entertainer's
performance
and
putting
it
on
a
news
program.
thank
you.
mr.
john
g.
lancione
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
members
of
the
court.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
on
that
very
same
page
where
note
a
(5)
is
located
on
a
(14)
in
the
record.
they
say
specifically
in
the
second
paragraph
that
under
the
standards
articulated
by
the
court,
and
they're
referring
to
the
supreme
court
and
they
say
time
v.
hill
and
they
go
on
to
describe
the
privilege,
and
then
they
go
over
once
again
in
--
in
discussing
these
cases.
they
say
that
the
same
privilege
exists
in
cases
where
appropriation
of
a
right
of
publicity
is
claimed.
they're
talking
about
the
first
amendment
privilege
that
has
been
discussed,
and
that
was
discussed
by
them
in
new
york
times
versus
sullivan
and
hill.
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
they
feel
constrained
just
as
the
district,
the
--
the
seventh
circuit,
i
believe,
in
gertz
felt
constrained
by
rosenbloom
to
say
that
the
stiff
standards
of
new
york
times
versus
sullivan
had
to
apply
to
a
private
individual
because
they
said
it
dealt
with
a
--
a
issue
of
public
interest.
and
the
court
there,
because
my
most
worthy
opponent
has
raised
the
question
of
--
of
how
we
get
here
and
why
we
are
here,
thus
the
court
stated
in
gertz,
the
petitioner
appealed
to
contest
the
applicability
of
the
new
york
times
standard
to
this
case
and
that's
why
they
were
here
in
gertz
and
that's
why
we
are
here.
in
his
brief,
he
also
points
out
that
a
new
trial
cannot
be
ordered,
but
i
think
on
page
352
of
gertz,
the
supreme
court
suggested
that
a
new
trial
should
take
place
and
remanded
to
the
lower
court
for
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
the
decision.
thank
you,
your
honor.
