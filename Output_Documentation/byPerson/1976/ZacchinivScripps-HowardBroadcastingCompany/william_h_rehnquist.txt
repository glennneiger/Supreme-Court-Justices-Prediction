therefore,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
would
have
reached
a
different
result
in
your
example
of
the
taping
of
the
eight
symphony
played
at
kennedy
center.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though,
that
would
put
on
an
educational
television
station
and
not
bill
this
news
but
just
said,
you
know,
here
is
a
brand
new
performance
of
beethoven's
eight.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bryan,
before
you
get
into
that
factual
point
of
your
proceeding
remark
in
response
to
the
chief
justice,
as
to
different
rule
obtaining
in
ohio
if
the
promoters
had
excluded
the
tv
people,
it's
my
impression
that
at
least
your
colleague
contends
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
felt
constrained
to
reach
the
result
it
did
here
because
of
the
first
amendment.
that
is
that
we're
not
judging
ohio's
choice
of
policies
but
that
ohio
might
have
produced
a
different
result
here
had
it
not
been
for
the
first
amendment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
it
was
quite
the
contrary
that
your
--
your
opponent
feels
that
what
the
ohio
court
otherwise
would
have
held
was
a
property
right
that
was
protected
is
struck
down
by
the
first
amendment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
doesn't
stem
from
the
first
amendment,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
--
but
your
court
doesn't
have
to
stick
to
just
a
strictly
contract
approach.
it
can
say
the
thing
arises
out
of
a
commonly
law
property
concept,
can
it?
my
impression
is
they
would
have
said
that
had
they
now
felt
forbidden
to
do
so
by
the
first
amendment.
