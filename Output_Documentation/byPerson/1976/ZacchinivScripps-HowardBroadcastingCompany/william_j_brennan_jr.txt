justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
lancione,
in
that
respect,
i
noticed
that
the
court
of
appeals
--
i'm
looking
at
page
828,
in
paragraph
three,
i
guess
these
are
head
notes
in
that
syllabus
are
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
court
says
a
performer's
act
is
the
product
of
his
talent
and
as
such,
its
property
entitled
on
the
same
protection
under
the
common
law
as
any
other
property
right?
now,
does
that
holding
have
any
significance
in
this
case
in
light
of
the
--
of
the
absence
of
some
similar
statement
from
the
syllabi?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
we
may
ignore
that
and
concentrate
on
the
syllabi,
one,
two,
three?
is
that
correct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
suggesting
is,
certainly,
it
is
instated
as
expressively
by
the
supreme
court
in
the
syllabi
as
it
is
stated
by
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
there
any
significance
and
that
the
supreme
court
didn't
use
the
same,
the
same
phraseology?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
a
right
to
the
publicity
value
of
his
performance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
explicable
only
if
they
mean
by
that,
that
that's
tantamount
to
a
property.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
this
holding
refers
to
time
and
hill
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
not
refer
to
time
and
hill.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
effect
of
that
holding
and
the
settlement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
did
he
have
a
contract
to
perform?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
just
purely
whether
or
not
this
was
the
report
of
a
news
event
or
the
appropriation
of
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
a
right,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
in
light
of
your
colloquy
with
my
brother
stewart,
which
when
i
look
at
a
15,
what's
the
significance
of
the
last
sentence
in
that
carryover
paragraph?
it
might
also
be
the
case
that
the
press
would
be
liable
if
it
recklessly
disregarded
contract
rights
existing
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
third
person
to
present
the
performance
to
the
public
but
that
question
is
not
presented
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
page
a15.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
the
last
sentence
in
that
carryover
paragraph,
just
before
the
last
paragraph
of
the
opinion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
the
showing
on
--
you
really
can't
appreciate
this
on
tv,
go
see
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
have
to
see
it,
really
to
appreciate
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
bryan.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
what
i
read
your
colleague
from
footnote
5?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
what
appears
in
footnote
5
that
the
gravamen
of
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
whether
the
degree
of
intrusion
is
reasonable
but
whether
first
amendment
principles
require
that
the
right
of
privacy
give
way
to
the
public
right
to
be
informed
of
matters
of
public
interest
and
concern.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
i'm
addressing
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
you
just
said
that
there
is
no
first
amendment
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
say
it's
a
--
what
they
did
was
--
was
fashion
a
state
rule
even
though
under
the
influence
of
first
amendment
principles,
is
that
what
you're
saying.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
would
have
--
it
would
have
been
easy
for
all
of
us
if
they'd
rested
on
your
ohio
constitution
and
not
on
the
federal
constitution.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i've
said
things
about
this
myself.
