did
they
--
did
they
identify
it
as
a
property
right?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that's
not
--
is
that
in
the
syllabus?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
call
it
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
has
a
right
to
the
publicity
value
of
his
performance.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
then
--
he
does
advertise?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
lancione,
would
you
be
here
if
there
had
been
just
a
still
photograph
of
him
in
mid
flight
rather
than
the
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
15-second
tape
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what's
the
difference?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
change
my
questions
a
little
bit.
suppose
that
this
performance
had
been
in
a
public
square
and
used
to
have
one
in
cleveland,
supposed
it
been
there
for
your
church,
would
it
make
any
difference?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
to
what
extent
however
is
he
subject
to
what
the
entrepreneur
or
the
empresarial
does
or
does
not
do?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
that
make
any
difference?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
read
you
what
is
at
the
bottom
of
performances,
the
program
of
the
kennedy
center
here.
the
taking
of
photographs
and
the
use
of
photo
--
recording
equipment
are
not
allowed
in
this
auditorium.
this
is
by
the
management
of
the
kennedy
center.
does
this
reflected
all
on
the
situation,
supposed
the
--
that
statement
were
just
the
reverse,
that
the
taking
of
photographs
is
permissible
in
the
kennedy
center?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
or
in
the
kennedy
center?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
get
some
support
from
your
position
from
footnote
5
at
the
bottom
of
page
14,
the
gravamen
of
the
issue
on
this
case
is
not
by
the
degree
of
intrusion
is
reasonable
but
whether
first
amendment
principles
require
that
the
right
of
privacy
give
away
to
the
public
right,
be
informed
the
matters
of
public
interest
and
concern,
the
concept
of
privilege
seems
to
be
--
seems
the
more
useful
and
appropriate
one.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
said
--
you
said
that
the
syllabus
may
be
illumined
by
the
opinion.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
under
your
law,
and
so
that
may
you
rely
on
footnote
5?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
gather
--
i
gather
from
what
--
your
supreme
court
said
at
page
15,
no
issue
of
disregard
a
contract
right
is
involved
here.
