justice
thurgood
marshall
will
you
give
me
the
definition
between
the
right
of
publicity
and
the
right
of
privacy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
supposed
in
the
two
syllabi,
two
and
three,
there
had
been
a
final
phrase
on
that,
under
ohio
law
on
the
two
and
three?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
admit
two
is
under
ohio
law.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
say,
three
also
under
ohio
law,
a
tv
station
has
a
privilege
to
report,
why
would
you
be
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
that
you
--
i
assume
that
you
have
tv
rights,
your
client.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
muhammad
ali
does.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
he
performed
in
the
square
in
front
of
the
tv
stations,
for
the
general
public
to
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
go
ahead.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
leave
out
only
adding
to
my
question
and
answer.
if
people
thronged
in
front
of
the
tv
station
in
a
public
square
can
the
tv
station
photograph
it
and
put
it
on
the
news
program?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
it's
right
in
their
backyard?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
front
yard
rather.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
was
doing
it
and
he
would
be
paid
because
as
he
got
shot
out
the
camera
he
had
(inaudible)
on
the
back.
could
they
publish
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
shot
it
into
the
tv
window,
could
they
do
it
then?
