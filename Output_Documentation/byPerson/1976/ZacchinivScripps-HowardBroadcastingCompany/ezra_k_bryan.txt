mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please.
i
still
am
perplexed
after
hearing
my
eminent
opponent
here,
really
is
how
to
we
got
here.
when
i
first
heard
that
certiorari
had
been
granted
in
this
case,
i
was
at
least
seriously
puzzled
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
had
the
apocryphal
thought
that
perhaps,
we
had
slipped
back
to
the
looking
glass
of
lewis
carroll
with
ellis.
now,
the
explanations
this
morning
and
the
answering
the
court's
questions
get
us
no
place
as
it
seems
to
me
either
as
the
fundamental
facts
or
fundamental
law
that
raises
a
serious
federal
question
that
should
be
here.
in
the
factual
area,
there
is
emphasis
on
the
originality
of
an
artist's
act
and
that
sort
of
thing.
there
is
a
book
on
circus,
it
was
written
quite
a
few
years
ago
that
a
historical
authority
apparently
on
the
subject
by
marianne
murray.
and
in
that
book,
a
great
credit
is
given
to
the
zacchini's
as
inventors,
as
practice
artists,
as
writers,
and
one
of
the
things
that
first
got
them
to
noticed
in
this
country
was
the
invention
of
a
better
mechanism
for
a
cannon
to
project
a
human
being
by
hugo's
father
and
his
brother.
and
hugo
was
the
first
man
who
did
it
apparently
with
that
mechanism
a
better
one,
but
pt
barnum,
shot
mademoiselle
zazel
for
60
feet
back
in
1879
and
called
it
the
human
cannon
ball
act.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
no,
sir,
and
i
think
that
this
--
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
i
don't
think
that
this
--
i
don't
see
this
theory
of
a
unique
little
situation
of
a
15-second
act
can
apply
on
any
broad
principle
to
the
kind
of
question
that
you
are
raising,
sir.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
it
would
a
--
it
would
make
a
serious
difference
under
the
definition
of
the
media
privilege
by
the
ohio
supreme
court.
they
have
said
that
the
media
may
use
it
in
the
news
contents
but
they
may
not
appropriate
the
benefit
of
the
publicity
for
some
non
privileged
private
use.
you
can't
make
a
news
program,
in
my
judgment,
it's
going
to
stand
up
in
the
court
of
ohio
and
the
phase
of
that
out
of
a
full
symphony.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
well
--
i
--
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
well
--
i
merely
--
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
don't
see
how
we
are
going
to
be
able
to
concede
that
the
entire
long
performances
of
those
people
who
are
protecting
themselves,
they
are
protected
by
the
notice
on
the
ticket.
there
are
contract
arrangements
that
are
made
and
performance
like
mr.
zacchini
and/or
in
the
contracts
with
people
at
fairs,
at
the
ball
park
when
they
--
when
they
put
on
acts.
they
have
contracts
which
limit
the
right
of
anybody
to
come
in
and
take
it,
and
i
would
say
that
in
answer
to
the
question
that
mr.
chief
justice
asked
about
muhammad
ali,
that
there
isn't
any
possibility
in
my
judgment
that
that
would
get
by
the
state
of
ohio.
the
state
of
ohio
is
not
saying
you
can
go
in
and
steal
things
and
break
contracts.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
oh,
incidentally
--
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
this
was
not
surreptitious.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
that
the
tv
people
along
with
others
were
invited
free
in
order
to
do
this
and
my
eminent
colleague
--
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
no,
but
he
contracted
to
put
on
a
performance
for
some
promoters
who
did
invite
these
people,
and
he
did
not
have
an
agreement
with
them
that
they
prevent
the
taking
of
pictures.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
only
facts
in
this
record
do
not
support
my
eminent
counsel's
position
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
how
--
of
zucchini
seeking
out
the
photographer
and
objecting,
there
is
an
affidavit
--
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
cannot
find
that
doubt
in
what
the
court
did.
now,
if
this
court
does
find
it,
then
i
think
the
proper
approach
would
be
to
ask
the
ohio
supreme
court.
the
funny
thing
about
all
this
relying
on
the
--
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
pardon?
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
i
beg
your
pardon
--
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
well,
absolutely
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
free
speech
--
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
no,
i
understand.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
well,
all
they
say
is
there
is
--
that
there
is
a
principle
involved
here.
that's
what
they
were
seeking
and
that
footnote
is
in
connection
with
our
seeking
and
i
was
going
to
go
into
exactly
what
they
saw
and
found
very
briefly.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
well,
absolutely,
your
honor.
we
have
in
the
state
of
ohio
constitutional
provisions
that
are
relatively
comparable.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
well,
one
of
the
curious
things,
mr.
justice
brennan
is,
that
there
is
so
much
looking
toward
washington
anymore.
i
wonder
if
we'll
all
start
to
bother
these,
one
of
these
days.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
and
on
the
first
amendment
i
don't
think
is
a
doubt
about
it,
but
when
you
track
on
what
occurred
here
in
that
--
on
that
subject,
you
find
that
the
ohio
court
merely
--
they
studied
the
time
versus
hill
inc.
and
then
as
i
am
--
and
counsel
has
on
his
petition
page
brief
for
guidance
on
that
issue
and
the
media
privilege
the
court
turned
to
the
rulings
in
time,
inc.
versus
hill
and
new
york
times
company
versus
sullivan,
drawing
from
the
two-sided
authority's
concept
that
the
news
media
possesses
a
privilege
to
disseminate
news
and
matters
of
public
interest.
now,
if
you
turn
to
his
brief
on
pages
9
and
10,
you
find
that
he
concedes
that
this
great,
high
principle
which
they
drew
from
the
study
of
these
cases
and
the
restatement
is
exactly
the
same
thing.
i
have
great
difficulty
distinguishing
where
he
says
that
there
is
no
question
that
the
broadcast
media
has
the
privilege
and
right
to
report
newsworthy
events
of
public
interest.
his
quarrel
is
with
the
line
that
the
ohio
state
supreme
court
drew
in
his,
and
i
submit
rather
minor,
sort
of
tort
claim
case.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
no,
sir.
i
do
not.
i
would
have
to
argue
very
strenuously
that
--
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
oh,
i
see.
i'm
sorry,
sir.
you
are
referring
to
the
question
of
the
--
of
the
full
“the
entire
performance.”
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
your
honor,
in
my
judgment,
if
there
is
a
legitimate
news
use
which
our
court
is
requiring
under
their
test
in
this
case,
then
the
performers
must
rely
on
agreements
and
contracts.
this
is
a
request
that
this
court,
under
the
guise
of
the
first
amendment,
set
up
some
new
rights
in
lieu
of
contract
rights,
copy
law
rights,
patent
rights
--
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
do
not
think
that
our
court
looked
at
this
in
any
sense
as
a
property
right
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
knocked
down
a
suggestion
by
judge
day
on
our
court
of
appeals
suggesting
that
there
was
conversion
and
i
think
they
refer
in
their
opinion
to
the
fact
that
you
can't
have
conversion.
no,
there's
no
property
right
here.
day
referred
to
it
specifically
as
being
in
the
--
as
a
part
of
our
right
of
privacy
which
is
a
personal
right.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
no,
of
course
not.
there's
nothing
here
that
i
see
that
stems
from
the
first
amendment.
that's
--
that's
essentially
why
i'm
--
i'm
bothered
about
how
we
arrived
here.and
i
think
that
the
time
obviously
is
getting
short.
but
i
think,
i
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
upon
reading
--
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
well,
i
think
there
are
two
points,
if
you
please,
mr.
justice
white.
one
point
is
that
our
court
did
not
feel
compelled
by
decisions
of
this
court
or
by
the
first
amendment
to
hold
the
way
it
did.
they
held
in
a
common
law
case,
we
will
give
this
much
right
and
no
more.
and
i
think
that
the
second
point
is
that
the
--
this
federal
court,
i
respectfully
submit,
should
not
be
going
beyond
the
point
of
dictating
to
the
states
what
the
minimum
requirements
are
rather
than
saying
that
from
now
on,
we
will
set
in
certain
commonly
situations,
we
will
set
exact
standards.
they
asked
in
the
terminology
of
specific
all
the
way
through,
and
i
believe
that
--
that
my
friend
has
been
guilty
of
a
procrasti
and
distortion
of
gertz
in
trying
to
apply
the
situation
here.
first
off,
gertz
did
involve
libel
per
se
and
here,
you
have
a
right
of
publicity
case,
a
right
of
privacy
type
action
in
which
the
respondent
was
guilty
only
of
broadcasting
a
brief
and
very
flattering
account
of
a
public
performer.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
we're
arguing
that
far,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
the
first
amendment
immunizes
you
from
--
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
i
mean
us.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
or
the
public
generally.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
right.
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
--
that
they
are
immunized
from
things
that
are
covered
by
specific
kinds
of
property
law.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
i
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
they
say
this
is
a
personal
right
because
it
is
part
of
the
right
of
publicity
--
of
a
privacy.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
this
goes
--
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
yes,
but
it
grows
directly
out
it.
they
say
it
goes
our
of
our
right
of
--
of
privacy
--
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
ohio's
common
law.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
right,
but
the
right
of
publicity
is
an
outgrowth
of
the
right
of
privacy
and
in
the
state
of
ohio
--
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
of
course,
it
sounds
that
way,
but
in
the
state
of
ohio,
the
fact
is
that
they
specifically
recognizes
being
an
outgrowth.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
sir,
they
did
not
use
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
they
--
they
turned
down
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
of
the
majority
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
was
conversion,
and
one
of
the
grounds
of
doing
that,
i
think,
was
that
there
was
no
property.
it
can't
convert
anything.
but
if
you
lose,
you
still
got
your
face
even
if
they
have
the
picture
was
sort
of
the
approach.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
i
think
those
are
all
occurred
by
contract
and
i
don't
think
that
our
court
is
granting
immunity
to
the
contract
rights.
they
recognize
that
they
probably
wouldn't.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
can't
see
that
they
felt
compelled
that
way
because
they
felt
compelled
to
the
extent
of
finding
a
concept
and
principle,
which
my
worthy
opponent
concedes
as
i
pointed
out.
now,
the
--
the
state
of
ohio,
i
don't
think
there
should
be
any
doubt
if
we
look
at
the
holding
in
gertz.
there
should
be
no
doubt
that
the
state
of
ohio
in
granting
or
recognizing
a
right
of
publicity.
this
hasn't
been
something
that's
nailed
into
our
constitution
or
fundamental
statutory
law.
this
is
simply
something
that
the
court
has
granted
and
has
put
some
strings
on
it.
i
submit
that
our
court
could
have
granted
it
with
an
absolute
prohibition
against
any
right
of
ever
recovering
on
the
right
of
publicity
from
the
news
media
or
from
tv
or
from
radio,
or
from
newspapers.
i
mean,
this
is
a
commonly
right
they
were
creating,
and
i
don't
see
how
as
long
as
they
follow
the
dictate
of
the
holding
in
gertz
that
they
may
determine
by
a
common
law
what
the
liability
will
be
for
libel,
so
lang
as
they
do
not
go
below
the
standard
of
negligence.
i
mean,
it's
a
minimum
standard.
it
should
be
fixed
in
--
in
my
judgment,
if
the
court
please,
in
this
situation.
i
will,
simply
for
the
sake
of
concluding,
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
plaintiff
entered
the
ohio
court
naked
and
emerged
clothed
with
a
new
common
law
right
that
was
fashioned
by
the
ohio
supreme
court.
are
you
satisfied
with
the
cloth
and
the
color?
but
most
unhappy
about
the
tailoring.
he
is
seeking
here
to
have
this
court
re-tailor
his
common
law
ground,
and
i
submit
that
that
lays
open
very
large
risks
for
the
whole
problem
of
the
committee
between
state
and
federal
courts
in
the
future.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please.
i
--
have
not
--
nearly
is
the
time
but
i
would
like
to
very
briefly
covered
just
four
very
quick
points.
number
one,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
case,
there
was
no
trespass
and
in
addition,
there
was
no
condition
imposed
by
zacchini
in
a
way
in
which
he
could
that
prohibits
anyone
from
taking
a
picture.
and
the
fact
is
that
is
shown
in
the
appendix
at
page
55,
the
only
evidence
before
the
ohio
court
on
this
subject
is
not
what
my
worthy
opponent
says
but
because
that's
merely
in
the
complaint
and
never
sustained
--
supported
by
an
affidavit
which
is
required
under
ohio
procedure.
the
only
affidavit
states
that
zacchini
seeing
a
cameraman
with
a
television-type
camera
approached
him
and
told
him
he
did
not
want
it
done.
there
was
no
seeking
out
of
zacchini
to
obtain
consent
or
permission
so
that
it's
no
different
that
if
zacchini
had
gone
up
to
a
scout
master
whoever
the
scout
who
wanted
to
take
some
pictures
that
i
don't
want
you
to
take
any
pictures.
i
don't
believe
there's
anyway
that
--
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
you
are
--
you
are
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
and
if
they
--
wws
made
a
commercial
use
for
profit
of
the
film
that
they
took
and
the
film
that
they
used,
then
we
are
dead
under
the
law
--
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
--
of
ohio.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
no,
sir.
they
did
not.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
your
honor
--
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
your
honor,
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
but
that,
your
honor,
i
think,
it
has
been
recognized
in
our
law
to
date
would
be
the
first
step
to
total
censorship
in
this
country.
you
cannot,
without
having
media
except
for
throw-away
free
hand
bills.
now,
if
you
want
to
have
somebody
who
throws
away
free
hand
bills,
there's
otherwise
recognize
--
it's
been
recognized
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
there
is
a
profit
motif
in
publishing
newspapers,
they
profit
motif
in
the
television.
but
if
it's
going
to
be
the
test
of
news
is
whether
or
not
it's
via
a
medium
that
is
making
a
profit,
then
your
honor,
i
submit
that
we
are
not
far
away
from
total
government
control
as
in
some
countries
of
news,
that
if
you
don't
any
news
except
that
which
the
ruling
will
approve.
the
other
point
that
i
want
to
try
and
be
sure
to
clarify
was
this
matter
of
the
right
of
privacy
into
the
right
of
publicity.
the
original
--
the
first
recognition
of
the
right
of
privacy
in
this
country
was
in
new
york
state
by
statute,
after
it's
been
held
of
little
girl
who
had
her
picture
used
on
a
flower
sect,
if
i
remember
rightly,
had
no
right
of
recovery,
and
they
passed
the
commercial
appropriation
theory
of
the
right
of
privacy.
now,
prosser
has
expanded
into
other
areas
that
are
somewhat
related.
the
right
of
publicity
was
first
recognized
as
a
name,
as
i
recall
it
by
judge
jerome
frank
in
the
topps
trading
card
case,
the
baseball
players'
pictures
and
statistics.
and
he
called
to
said,
it
might
be
more
appropriately
known
as
the
right
of
publicity.
so,
even
in
new
york
state
with
the
right
of
privacy
has
still
control
of
the
same
statute.
they
have
a
commonly
right
now
of
publicity,
but
the
common
law
right
of
publicity
that
has
been
recognized
has
been
recognized
as
a
right
which
can
be
exercised
only
when
there
is
the
commercial
use
in
most
places.
our
court
actually
has
given
a
performer,
a
greater
right
under
the
right
of
publicity
because
the
defense
of
--
of
the
immediate
privilege
is
circumscribed
a
little
more
than
it
would
be
where
the
complainant
would
have
to
prove
that
there
was
a
commercial
appropriation.
and
the
final
point
that
i
would
like
to
make,
if
the
court
pleases,
that
this
is
a
situation
which,
in
my
judgment,
very
clearly,
if
this
narrow
interest
plea
of
this
plaintiff
is
recognized
is
having
any
first
amendment
or
constitutional
breadth
or
right,
would
be
an
act
of
beating
the
shield
of
the
first
amendment
for
free
speech
and
free
press
into
a
sword.
and
that
sword
would
chop
down
the
historic
right
of
the
states
to
determine
their
common
law,
subject
to
not
violating
some
federal
law.
and
in
this
case,
an
area
has
always
been
not
violating
the
minimum
standards
determined
by
this
court
applicable
to
the
first
amendment
privilege.
thank
you.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
yes,
sir,
i
do.
that's
--
that's
where
--
if
i
remember
rightly,
that's
where
the
court
was
looking
to
the
restatement
of
torts
for
guidance
along
with
new
york
times
and
--
and
against
sullivan
and
time-hill
if
i
remember
rightly.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
and
what
the
court
is
doing
there,
as
i
understand
it,
is
referring
to
the
fact
that
the
restatement
after
the
time
that
they
had
written
the
restatement
number
13,
which
was
the
one
that
the
court
was
using
for
guidance
had
come
up
with
restatement
number
21
and
in
that
when
they
rejiggered,
they
--
language
and
approach
a
good
deal
and
went
from
privilege
to
something
about
reasonable
--
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
right
sir.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
well,
i
think
sir
it
could
be
both.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
the
constitutional
privilege
too,
which
they
could
appoint
it
too
and
we
--
i
wouldn't
be
here
if
they
had
done
that.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
well,
i
--
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
in
--
in
dictating
the
common
law
of
ohio
that
they
can
use
the
word
“privilege”
as
the
practical
result
that
they're
imposing.
there
isn't
any
doubt
that
the
court
in
ohio
felt
that
there
had
to
be
a
privilege
by
reason
of
the
first
amendment.
they've
used
that
in
some
respects
as
their
antecedents.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
but
the
other
--
but
on
the
other
hand
this
specific
privilege
granted
by
the
state
of
ohio
was
not
dictated,
as
we
read
it,
by
anything
that
they
found
in
the
positions
of
this
court.
mr.
ezra
k.
bryan
well,
your
honor,
we
submit
that
in
our
judgment
in
an
appropriate
case
we
could
be
up
here
fighting
that
it
is
not.
but
to
prove
that
the
ohio
court
particularly
in
the
intent
to
injure
has
probably
gone
beyond
what
we
feel
should
be
the
first
amendment
minimum
privilege.
