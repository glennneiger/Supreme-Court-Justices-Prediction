you
--
would
you
be
here
if
the
ohio
had
just
said,
“under
our
law,
there
is
no
right
in
publicity
or
no

right
or
any
other
kind
of
a
right
in
this
--
justice

you
don't
think
the
first
amendment
gives
it
--
gets
it
to
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
the
matter
--
that's
the
matter
of
ohio
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
what
if
--
what
if
the
ohio
court
had
said,
“well,
we
recognize
that
there
is
a
right,
a
property
right,
a
publicity,
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
but
as
a
matter
of
ohio
law,
the
press
has
a
limited
privilege
of
reporting
it
and
they
have
not
exceeded
in
this
case.
supposed
that's
what
the
--
what
the
third
syllabus
had
said,
you
wouldn't
be
here
either
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
how
do
we
know
what
they
--
how
they
acted?
he
just
looked
at
the
syllabus
here,
it
doesn't
say,
does
it,
whether
it's
a
first
amendment?
they
took
a
first
amendment
approach,
whether
they
thought
the
first
amendment
required
the
privilege
or
whether
they
--
or
just
announcing
a
matter
of
ohio
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
by
the
usual
scenario,
are
you
suggesting
it's
been
suggested
by
the
usual
standards
found
in
our
cases
as
to
whether
or
not
a
federal
question
was
--
was
passed
upon
in
the
state
court
that
under
this

we
should

we
have
no

justice

this
case
is
here
from
a
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
it
arose
when
hugo
zacchini,
an
entertainer,
sued
the
scripps-howard
broadcasting
company.
the
operator
of
a
television
station
claiming
that
he
has
rights
under
the
ohio
law
privacy
had
been
violated
when
the
station
had
broadcast
a
film
of
his
performance
without
his
consent.
zacchini,
interestingly
enough
has
called
the
"human
cannonball".
his
entire
act
consist
of
being
shot
from
a
cannon
into
a
net
some
200
feet
away.
this
dispute
came
about
when
zacchini
who
had
been
hired
to
perform
on
a
regular
basis
at
a
county
fair
in
ohio
objected
to
his
act
being
filmed
by
a
television
reporter.
the
film
was
made
anyway
and
it
was
shown
on
the
stations
evening
broadcast.
zacchini
sued.
under
the
ohio
privacy
law,
an
entertainer
has
what
is
called
the
"right
of
publicity."
that
is
the
exclusive
right
to
publicized
and
commercially
exploit
his
performances
as
well
as
his
name
and
his
likeness.
the
supreme
court
agreed
with
zacchini
that
he
had
such
right
and
that
has
been
violated,
but
held
that
he
had
no
remedy
because
as
it
understood
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
as
construed
by
the
cases
in
this
court,
the
television
station
was
constitutionally
privileged
to
do
what
it
did
in
this
case.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
reversed.
none
of
our
cases
has
reached
this
situation
and
we
declined
to
hold
that
that
a
television
station
is
constitutionally
privileged
to
broadcast
a
performer's
entire
act
without
his
consent,
whether
it's
part
of
a
news
broadcast
or
otherwise.
entertainment
is
important
news
and
thus
scripps-howard
could
undoubtedly
have
broadcast
the
essential
facts
of
zacchini's
performance
as
part
of
its
news
broadcast.
but
the
first
amendment
does
not
protect
the
appropriation
of
an
entire
act
anymore
than
it
would
be
used
for
copyright
at
work.
ohio
need
not
have
extended
a
right
of
publicity
to
zacchini
and
even
if
it
did,
it
could
as
a
matter
of
its
own
law
constitution
or
statutory,
privileged
the
press
to
do
what
it
did
here,
privileged
to
television
station
to
broadcast
this
film.
all
we
hold
is
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
which
applies
the
first
to
the
states
does
not
required
the
state
to
do
so.
the
judgment
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
powell
joined
by
justices
brennan
and
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
mr.
justice
stevens
also
dissents.
