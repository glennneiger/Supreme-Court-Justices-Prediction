e.

we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
76-577,
zacchini
against
scripps-howard.
mr.
lancione,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
you
call
this
reporting
or
reproducing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
we've
been
told
a
good
many
times
in
ohio
cases
when
they
come
here
that
the
law
of
the
case
is
the
syllabus.
they
had
not
--
not
the
opinion.
is
that
binding
on
--
is
that
law
of
ohio?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
is
that
particular
concept
of
ohio
law
binding
on
this
court
in
the
first
amendment
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we
have
accepted
it,
i
think,
tacitly
as
binding
for
some
purposes
that's
why
i
focused
on
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
focused
on
the
proposition.
is
it
binding
on
this
court
when
we're
dealing
with
the
first
amendment
case
which
is
not
the
first
amendment
not
being
the
exclusive
property
of
the
court's
--
of
ohio.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lancione,
i
assume
that
mr.
justice
marshall's
question
presupposed
that
you
wouldn't
have
that
material
on
page
13
that
explicated
the
federal
aspect.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
close
hypothetically
to
you
and
i'm
going
to
ask
your
friends
that
you
comment
on
same
hypothetical
later
on
when
his
turn
comes.
when
muhammad
ali
engages
in
one
of
his
professional
exhibitions,
priced
fighting,
i
understand
that
the
ratio
is
about
10
to
one
or
more
that
the
tv
rights
are
many,
many
times
the
income
he
receives
from
the
persons
who
are
present
at
the
--
at
the
arena.
suppose
surreptitiously,
either
of
the
networks
or
an
outlaw,
a
group
filmed
the
entire
fight
and
then
tried
to
put
it
on
the
air,
do
you
analogize
your
client's
situation
to
what
that
could
be
with
muhammad
ali?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
doesn't
have
to
go
to
take
the
trouble
to
exclude
people.
you're
on
the
theory
of
your
case,
only
those
can
take
the
television
pictures
who
have
paid
for
that
right,
who
have
contracted
with
him
for
that
or
contracted
with
the
county
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
what
muhammad
ali
does,
makes
a
separate
contract.
he
doesn't
rely
on
chance.
he
makes
a
separate
contact
--
contract
for
the
television
rights.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
bryan?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there's
nothing
very
original
about
the
performances
of
the
eight
symphony
but
do
you
suggest
that
if
someone
came
in
and
covered
it
to
the
kennedy
centerwithout
the
consent
of
the
performers,
the
conductor
and
the
members
of
the
orchestra,
they
could
put
it
on
television?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
what's
the
history
of
the
act
got
to
do
with
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what's
the
difference
if
it
takes
15
seconds
or
30
minutes
for
the
performance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
some
of
mr.
muhammad
ali's
performances
lasts
only
about
15
seconds.
does
that
--
does
that
mean
that
the
performance
would
be
open
to
any
surreptitious
coverage
by
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
a
television
camera?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
by
--
not
by
mr.
zacchini
though?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
think
the
performer
has
something
to
say
about
whether
they
have
the
right
to
cover
it
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
--
then
you
argue
with
the
eight
symphony
illustration
too
and
you
said
that
if
the
eight
symphony
is
being
performed
by
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
talking
about
the
performance
whether
it's
10
seconds,
15
seconds
or
30
minutes
or
two
hours.
does
the
performer
not
have
something
to
say
about
whether
it's
going
to
be
covered
by
television?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
--
you
have
one
minute
left.
so,
--
no,
i
see
that
we
--
i
see
that
we
have
our
light
resumed
at
one
o'clock.
mr.
bryan,
do
you
have
something
further.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
there
some
difference
the
boy
scouts
wouldn't
be
making
use
of
that
for
commercial
purposes
for
profit
whereas
a
television
station
would
be,
the
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
didn't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
didn't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean,
when
a
--
when
a
newspaper
or
broadcaster
reproduces
something
in
its
paper,
it
isn't
doing
it
for
profit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
--
that's
the
enterprise
for.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lancione.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

judgment
and
opinion

zacchini

by
mr.
justice
white.
