justice

stewart
there
would
be
no
federal
question
over
there.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lancione,
how
was
his
objection
made
in
advance,
i
have
lost
track.
justice
potter
stewart
before
he
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
surreptitiously
but
wasn't
it
in
a
public
place
to
which
no
admission
was
charged?
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
contract,
i
assume
he
was
paid?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
critical,
i
suppose
to
the
supreme
court,
to
the
ohio
rule
of
right
of
publicity,
if
mr.
zacchini
had
just
done
this
for
the
fun
of
it
in
the
county
park
or
in
the
public
square,
in
his
backyard
just
like
to
do
it
every
now
and
then
and
a
news
camera
gotten
off
--
a
tv
news
camera
have
gone
out
there
and
reported
that
as
news,
there
would
be
no
proprietary
right
to
have
been
appropriated
within
because
he
wouldn't
have
--
with
certainly
no
monetary
right.
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
a
property
right
for
which
he
was
paid
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
his
contract.
and
that
is
critical
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
wouldn't
be
a
non-privileged
private
use.
it
would
be
a
use
in
the
news
program,
precisely
the
same
news
that
was
made
of
the
cannonball
act
here,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
a
hypothetical
question.
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn't
it
be
a
private
use?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
--
well,
let's
begin
with
the
proposition
to
which
i
think
you
would
agree
that
the
ohio
court
has
said
there
is
a
ohio,
a
common
law
right
of
publicity.
it
would
have
been
little
more
understandable
to
me
if
they
have
said
there
was
a
property
right
of
a
performer
and
his
performance
or
a
professional
performer
in
his
performance.
but
they
said
there
was
a
publicity
right
that
there
is
no
--
that
can
be
protected
against
acquisition
by
somebody
else
subject
to
the
exception
in
--
in
paragraph
three
of
the
syllabus.
so,
you
begin
with
this
proprietary
right
that's
protected
against
acquisition.
and
what
if
there
were
brand
new
hit
record,
gramophone
record
in
which,
of
course,
there
is
the
same
kind
of
proprietary
right
and
a
news
program
on
television
said,
“there's
a
brand
new
hit
record.
it
leads
all
the
lists
everywhere
in
the
country
and
as
a
matter
of
news,
we're
not
going
to
play
it
in
its
entirety.”
and
would
that
--
would
it
be
immune
from
paying
for
copyright
infringement,
paying
the
usual
fee
for
playing
the
record
just
because
it's
on
news
program?
would
there
be
any
of
the
first
amendment
that
would
make
it
immune
from
paying
the
royalty?
justice
potter
stewart
not
me,
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
no,
not
you.
that
would
be
your
client,
a
news
broadcaster.
justice
potter
stewart
a
news
broadcaster's
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
a
person
opinion
on
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
arguably.
justice
potter
stewart
well
this
is
a
specific
kind
of
property
law
created
by
the
common
law
of
ohio.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
publicity.
justice
potter
stewart
publicity.
justice
potter
stewart
who's
right
of
privacy
it
is?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no.
whose,
your
clients
or
--
or
your
brother's
clients
right
of
privacy?
they're
talking
here
about
the
right
of
publicity.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
is
180
degree
offset,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
property
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
a
right
that
--
when
one
is
liable
for
acquiring
without
compensation.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what's
your
answer
to
a
--
do
you
think
under
the
law
of
ohio
now
that
a
news
broadcaster
could,
with
impunity,
play
a
hit
record
in
its
entirety
on
the
basis
of
this
--
this
is
leading
all
the
list
and
this
is
the
news
of
tonight
in
the
entertainment
field?
