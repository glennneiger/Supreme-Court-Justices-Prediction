justice
john
paul
stevens
i
supposed
but
if
no
permission
was
necessary
to
be
there,
say
he'd
never
asked
to
do
it,
presumably
he
could
have
done
it
without
anybody
objecting
and
nothing
surreptitious
or
off
the
record
about
it,
is
it
any
different
from
doing
something
in
a
public
park?
i
think
you
have
already
answered
that
to
mr.
justice
blackmun.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
objection
really
has
no
legal
significance
in
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bryan,
before
you
sit
down,
may
i
just
ask
you
about
the
footnote
that
justice
brennan
directed
counsel's
attention
to
in
the
ohio
supreme
court's
opinion,
footnote
5.
he
read
a
portion
of
the
sentence
that
talks
about
the
gravamen
of
the
issue
and
the
sentence
ends
with
the
words,
“the
concept
of
privilege
seems
the
more
useful
and
appropriate
one.”
do
you
--
do
you
know
what
i
had
in
mind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
the
question
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
were
debating
a
choice
between
whether
a
rule
would
make
the
appropriation
an
unreasonable
invasion
of
privacy
on
the
one
hand
or
a
question
of
whether
it
was
privileged
on
the
other.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
they
end
up
with
the
--
the
language
i
called
your
attention
to
the
concept
of
privilege
seems
the
more
useful
and
appropriate
one.
and
the
question
i
want
to
ask
you,
is
whether
in
your
view
the
word
“privilege”
in
that
sentence
is
used
in
the
sense
of
a
constitutional
privilege
or
as
an
exception
as
a
matter
of
state
law
from
a
tort
doctrine?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
it's
the
constitutional
privilege,
then
it
is
it
not
fair
to
infer
that
the
word
“privilege”
used
in
the
third
paragraph
of
the
court's
syllabus
is
also
the
constitutional
privilege.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
figure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
would
say
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
you
say
the
privilege
as
a
matter
of
ohio
law
is
co-extensive
with
the
privilege
commanded
by
the
first
amendment?
