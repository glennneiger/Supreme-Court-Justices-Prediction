chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
1439,
smith
against
the
united
states.
mr.
smith,
and
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
that
your
hypothetical
person
in
that
situation
took
the
material
which
had
been
declared
permissible
in
iowa
by
virtue
of
the
state
supreme
court's
action.
it
took
them
over
to
illinois
and
exhibited
them.
would
he
be
subject
to
prosecution
in
illinois,
assuming
that
it
was
forbidden
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
i'm
asking
a
hypothetical
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
might
be
--
be
subject
to
two
prosecutions
or
at
least
violating
two
statutes,
the
statutes
of
illinois
assuming
they
had
statutes
that
prohibited
this
and
the
federal
statutes
relating
to
interstate
transportation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
the
choice
of
the
particular
state
is
binding
only
on
the
--
that
state,
is
that
not
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose,
mr.
smith
that
we
had
a
state
which
for
reason
or
rather
simply
decided
not
to
make
bank
robbery
a
crime,
but
the
federal
statute
of
course
makes
it
a
crime
to
transfer
the
proceeds
over
a
state
line
and
it
also
makes
it
a
federal
crime
to
rob
a
national
bank.
do
you
think
the
iowa
view
of
--
iowa
legislatures
view
of
the
bank
robbery
would
prevail
over
the
federal
statutes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
doesn't
it
manifest
it
just
by
the
passage
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
a
national
standard.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
the
--
that's
the
judgment
of
the
jury
in
which
i
expressed
the
same
view
that
my
predecessor,
chief
justice
warren
expressed
that
this
is
an
--
essentially
a
matter
of
local
community
standards.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
this
would
apply
to
bank
robbery
too,
that
could
be
your
answer
to
that
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
unless
the
--
unless
the
federal
statute
made
out
some
sort
of
a
case
that
there's
a
special
reason
why
the
robbing
of
national
banks,
nationally
chartered
banks
is
a
--
is
a
bad
thing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
--
but
when
a
federal
jury
sitting
in
iowa
on
a
federal
misbranding
case,
such
as
suggested
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
they
do
as
every
jury
does
apply
their
own
standards
consistent
of
course
that
it
is
(inaudible)
with
the
instructions
from
the
court.
but
is
it
not
so
elementary
that
every
jury
applies
its
own
concepts
of
--
of
morality
and
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
one
set
of
jurors
might
look
at
a
particular
label
or
brand
on
drug
or
--
at
some
grocery
item
and
say,
“no,
this
is
--
this
is
a
not
a
misbranding.
it
doesn't
mislead
us.”
but
in
other
jury
and
in
another
town
in
the
state
of
iowa
might
look
at
it
and
say,
“yes,
this
is
a
misbranding.”
so,
you
can
get
that
variation
even
on
a
subject
to
this
kind,
could
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
said,
“hopefully,
the
jury
follows
the
instructions
of
the
court”,
but
we
know
that
juries
don't
always
do
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
smith,
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
district
judge
was
judge
stewart.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
make
that
same
argument
if
the
state
of
iowa
had
decriminalized
marijuana
or
heroine
and
the
federal
prosecution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
one
o'clock
mr.
shapiro.
mr.
shapiro
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
75-1439,
smith
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
blackmun.
