justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smith,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
your
argument
as
i
understand
it
relates
the
concept
of
contemporary
community
standards
to
the
whole
problem
of
defining
whether
something
is
obscene
or
not.
the
government
responds
as
i
understand
their
brief
by
saying
that
the
miller
test
has
three
parts
to
it.
the
first
of
which
is,
is
this
business
of
appealing
to
the
prurient
interest.
and
as
i
understand
them,
they
say
that
the
contemporary
community
standard
reference
only
modifies
that
first
part
of
the
three
part
miller
test.
you
--
what
was
your
response
to
that?
and
if
it
has
a
limited
application
rather
than
applying
to
the
whole
concept
of
obscenity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smith,
are
those
--
is
the
definition
of
the
contemporary
community
standard
or
the
local
community
standard.
is
that
an
issue
of
fact
or
an
issue
of
law
in
your
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shapiro
just
to
--
to
get
the
same
question
out,
is
it
your
view
that
the
determination
of
the
contemporary
community
standard
is
a
question
of
fact
or
a
question
of
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
i
don't
think
that
quite
answers
the
question.
you
suggested
the
first
two
parts
of
the
miller
test,
your
question
of
the
fact
that
the
third
part
might
be
questionable.
my
question
is
whether
the
community
standard,
the
definition
of
the
community
standard
itself
is
a
question
of
law
or
question
of
the
fact,
which
apparently
at
least
wherein
your
opponent
applies
to
all
three
parts
of
the
miller
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
--
may
i
just
interrupt
once
more,
mr.
shapiro.
i'm
vacillating
back
and
forth
between
the
contemporary
community
standard
being
question
of
fact
and
being
a
constitutional
standard
which
normally
would
be
a
legal
standard.
and
you
--
you've
reminded
us
that
the
court
does
not
require
the
government
to
offer
evidence
on
contemporary
community
standard.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
which
will
enable
appellate
--
an
appellate
judge
to
determine
what
the
contemporary
community
standard
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
subject
to
appellate
review
or
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
is
an
issue
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
does
an
appellate
--
how
does
an
appellate
judge
can
go
about
reviewing
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
correct
contemporary
community
standard
was
applied?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
but
are
they
questions
of
fact
that
can
be
decided
without
any
evidence
being
in
the
record
to
tell
us
what
the
standard
is
in
iowa.
as
i
understand
your
position,
the
government
need
offer
no
evidence
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
we
may
not
look
--
we
--
we
may
not
look
to
the
iowa
law
and
we
don't
have
to
accept
the
defendants
of
them,
so
what
do
we
look
at
to
see
what
the
standard
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)
to
determine
this
on
the
basis
of
their
own
knowledge
of
what
happens
in
the
community,
which
is
not
in
the
record
for
us
to
review,
is
it
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
i'll
make
this
question
of
vagueness
and
perhaps
the
allied
argument
of
overbreadth.
since
this
is
arguably
a
first
amendment
case,
as
well
as
a
due
process
notice
case,
do
we
--
is
it
a
complete
answer
to
say
that
the
statute
was
not
vague
as
applied
to
these
facts
or
should
we
look
at
the
potential
overbreadth
here
the
first
amendment
implication.
did
--
do
i
make
my
question
clear?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
let
me
ask
this
one
other
question,
it
has
been
on
my
mind.
is
it
your
understanding
that
the
matter
of
establishing
the
contemporary
community
standard
is
part
of
the
government's
affirmative
case
or
is
it
part
of
the
defense
that
the
defendant
may
assert.
which
--
who
has
the
burden
on
that
issue?
