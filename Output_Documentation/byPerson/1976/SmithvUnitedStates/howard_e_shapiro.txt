mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
would
be
useful
to
just
review
the
facts
of
the
case
before
we
discuss
the
law.
the
material
involved
in
this
case
consists
of
five
magazines,
five
photographs,
and
two
films
which
petitioner
deposited
in
the
mails
that
they
were
all
sent
to
addresses
within
the
state
of
iowa.
the
case
was
tried
to
a
jury.
the
defendant
put
on
evidence
of
community
standards
which
consisted
largely
of
photographs
and
magazines
of
a
similar
in
nature
to
the
material
which
is
alleged
to
be
obscene
here.
i
would
characterize
both
the
material
we
have
charged
to
be
obscene
and
the
defensive
material
as
obvious
hard
core
pornography.
the
district
court
permitted
the
defense
over
the
government's
objection
to
introduce
the
iowa
statute
which
limits
the
crime
of
obscenity
to
distribution
to
minors.
the
judge
also
in
his
instructions
charged
the
jury
to
consider
the
effect
of
that
statute
along
with
the
other
evidence
in
determining
what
the
community
standard
in
the
--
i
think
it's
the
central
district
of
iowa
is.
the
jury
after
being
charged
under
the
miller
test,
miller
and
hamling,
these
mailings
all
took
place
after
miller,
convicted
the
defendant
on
all
counts.
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes.
they're
in
the
record
at
22
and
23
--
actually,
let's
see,
they
begin
with
instruction
number
8
at
21,
and
they
carry
on.
they're
very
close
to
the
miller's
test.
at
page
22,
there
is
an
almost
literal
repetition
of
the
miller
test.
and
i
won't
read
it,
but
it's
stated
quite
clearly
including
a
definition
of
what
patently
offensive
means
in
referring
to
what
we
would
call,
“hard
core
pornography”.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
regret,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
mr.
judge
stewart,
i
think.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
now,
at
page
23
--
at
the
bottom
of
page
22
and
23
is
part
of
the
instruction
is
quite
important.
in
determining
the
view
of
the
average
persons
of
the
community,
you
are
each
entitled
to
draw
in
your
knowledge
and
the
views
of
the
average
person
in
the
community
from
which
you've
comment,
as
well
as
consider
the
evidence
presented
as
to
the
state
law
on
obscenity
and
materials
available
for
purchase
in
certain
stores
as
shown
by
the
evidence.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
the
district
judge
that
it
was
proper
for
the
jury
to
consider
the
effect
of
the
state
statute
and
it
also
concluded
that
this
was
simply
an
element
in
determining
community
standards
it
was
not
of
itself
conclusive
as
the
petitioner
here
contends.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
the
first
two
elements
of
the
test
in
miller,
we
believe
are
primarily
questions
of
fact.
the
court
so
said
in
miller
at
page
30
in
the
opinion,
that
the
last
element
dealing
with
whether
the
material
lacks
a
serious
literary,
artistic,
political
or
scientific
value
is
much
more
of
a
legal
question.
i
also
think
that
that
last
element
is
not
subject
to
a
community
standard
limitation
because
otherwise,
you
would
find
that
what
is
considered
serious
matter
in
one
part
of
a
country
could
not
flow
into
another
part
of
the
country.
so,
you
can't
limit
the
third
part
of
the
test
by
a
community
standards
factor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
will
regard
it
principally
as
a
question
of
fact
subject
to
one
qualification.
the
court
has
said
in
hamling
that
under
the
constitutional
test
in
miller,
a
state
may
for
state
purposes
constitutionally
define
the
geographic
reach
of
--
of
the
community
in
which
the
standard
is
to
be
applied.
and
that
brings
me
to
another
element
of
the
--
of
the
community
standard
test
which
it's
most
important
to
explicate.
that
is
that
the
contemporary
community
standards
element
of
the
test
refers
to
the
contemporary
mores
of
the
community,
and
that
is
independently
of
the
state
statutory
policy
which
either
makes
the
distribution
of
obscene
material
criminal
or
non-criminal.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
government
relied
on
the
decisions
in
--
i
think
it's
paris
adult
theatre
and
in
hamling
that
it
need
not
to
put
on
evidence
of
community
standards
for
a
jury
to
make
this
determination.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
let
me
--
let
me
illustrate
if
i
may,
your
honor.
in
a
state
which
has
a
statute
condemning
obscenity
the
miller
test
itself
recognizes
that
that
law
does
not
express
the
community
standard.
it
still
has
to
be
determined
by
the
jury
despite
the
state
law,
well
it
converses
equally
true.
the
jury
must
determine
for
itself
the
community
standard
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--
in
the
light
of
community
mores
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes.
no.
this
means
that
the
state
statute
is
a
factor
to
be
considered,
but
all
the
state
statute
in
iowa
does.
in
fact,
all
the
state
statutes
in
the
six
states
that
we
know
about
that
it
decriminalize
the
obscenity
to
do,
is
to
say
that
we
will
give
up
on
trying
to
prosecute
this
stuff
criminally.
it
certainly
isn't
an
approval
of
it.
it
isn't
an
encouragement
of
it.
it
doesn't
necessarily
reflect
what
this
court
is
talking
about
when
it
speaks
of
a
constitutional
standard
under
the
first
amendment
of
contemporary
community
standards
dealing
with
recognition
by
the
average
person
of
--
of
matter
that
appeals
to
prurient
interest
or
to
the
extent
that
community
standards
applies
to
the
patently
offensive
element
to
what
is
patently
offensive.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
and
we
would.
and
some
states
have
--
of
course,
it
has
been
pointed
out,
i
don't
want
--
there
is
a
difference
between
this
problem
of
conduct
and
--
and
problem
of
defining
obscenity
which
rest
on
a
constitutional
definition
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes.
that's
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
whether
--
whether
it
can
be
constitutionally
punished
at
least,
i
would
--
i
would
rather
express
it
in
that
way.
now,
as
i
said
the
states
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
in
the
defendant's
view,
the
materials
that
he
offered
and
the
states
statute.
in
the
government's
view,
the
state
statute
is
a
factor,
but
this
goes
to
an
element
that
the
jury
is
to
decide.
i
think
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
is
subject
to
appellate
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
is
subject
to
appellate
review
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
on
the
first
two
elements,
she
gives
the
greatest
weight
to
the
--
to
the
jury
that
the
constitutional
test
in
miller
as
the
court
has
recognized
when
it
dealt
with
the
question
of
the
geographic
scope
of
standards
is
essentially
factual
what
the
court
said
in
miller
was
that
--
under
a
national
constitution,
there
can
be
variation
from
community
to
community
and
then
it
went
on
to
say
--
there
aren't
fixed
national
standards
of
what
--
of
--
of
precisely
what
appeals
to
the
prurient
interest
or
is
patently
offensive.
these
are
essentially
questions
of
fact.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
understand.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
if
you
look
at
the
jury's
determination
because
this
is
the
aspect
of
the
issue
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
--
that
is
the
basis
of
the
test
as
it
has
been
defined
in
the
court's
decision.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
so
that
the
jury
may
consider
since
the
jury
is
permitted
to
consider
any
evidence
--
any
relevant
evidence
relating
to
what
constitutes
the
community's
standard
with
respect
to
what
appeals
to
the
prurient
interest
or
what
is
patently
offensive
and
that
the
statute
could
be
considered
by
them.
i
suppose
the
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not
and
it
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
i
think
the
difference
is
that
the
state
statute
here
dealing
with
the
criminal
--
the
decision
to
criminalize
or
not
criminalize
obscenity
would
to
some
effect,
would
to
some
extent
reflect
community
mores
but
the
weight
to
be
given
to
that
is
for
the
jury.
now,
the
state
law
of
course
in
this
case
didn't
purport
to
determine
community
standards
in
the
sense
of
the
miller
test.
all
it
said
was
that,
we
will
not
prosecute.
i'm
--
i'm
paraphrasing
it
grossly
but
we
will
not
prosecute
obscenity
as
a
crime.
now
it
doesn't
follow
from
this
that
the
community
mores
in
iowa
do
not
recognize
hard
core
pornography
to
be
obscene
because
basically
that's
what
you're
dealing
with.
is
this
material
obscene
or
not?
moreover,
the
iowa
statute
didn't
purport
to
regulate
the
federal
mails.
there
is
no
conflict
or
nullification
here
of
state
law.
there's
no
conflict
with
--
with
federal
law.
there
is
simply
different
policies
within
each
jurisdiction's
respective
sphere
of
constitutional
responsibility.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
statute?
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes.
but
everything
that
offends
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
but
the
iowa
statute
doesn't
say
that.
all
it
says
is
that
it
shall
not
be
a
crime.
it
doesn't
say
anything
else.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
your
honor,
it
is
that
12
people
applying
the
instructions
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
under
this
court's
decisions,
there
is
guidance.
the
guidance
is
the
guidance
set
forth
in
the
miller
test
and
that
guidance
applies
in
a
meaningful
way
as
jenkins
against
georgia
demonstrates
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
there
are
limits
on
the
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that,
i
don't
think
is
the
issue,
when
one
likes
obscenity
or
not
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it's
a
community
standard
which
goes,
does
this
material
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
i
think
the
community
standard
in
iowa
is
reflected
on
this
jury's
determination
is
that
hard
core
pornography
can
be
recognized
as
a
material
which
to
the
average
person
appeals
to
the
prurient
interest
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--
and
which
is
patently
offensive
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--
in
its
depiction
of
explicit
sex.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
there
is
a
possibility
of
inconsistent
jury
verdicts
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
there
is
a
possibility
of
inconsistent
jury
verdicts.
the
court
has
recognized
that
in
its
decision
both
in
hamling
and
in
roth.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
statue
appears
in
the
record.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
in
its
--
i
believe
that
is
the
insight.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
that's
the
--
that
is
the
statue
in
its
entirety.
now,
it
has
been
amended.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
recently
to
exclude
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--
the
matter
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
well,
we
--
there
was
a
question
about
the
scope
of
the
federal
responsibility
here.
now,
i
have
said
that
what
we've
got
when
a
state
decriminalizes
obscenity,
is
a
difference
in
policy
between
a
--
the
federal
policy
and
the
state
policy,
each
has
a
responsibility
of
its
own
under
the
constitution.
the
federal
responsibly
in
this
case
rests
on
the
postal
power.
that
power
extends
to
both
interstate
and
intrastate
mailings
and
it
may
be
exercised
for
the
nation
as
a
whole.
in
exercising
it,
congress
may
--
and
we
think
in
18
u.s.c
1461
has
adopted
a
nationwide
prohibition
barring
obscene
matter
from
the
mails,
whether
mail
interstate
or
intrastate.
as
a
constitutional
matter,
that
test
is
subject
in
the
determination
--
that
statute
in
the
determination
of
obscenity
is
subject
to
the
contemporary
community
standards
element.
but
it
is
not
subject
to
any
sort
of
state
interpositions
between
the
people
of
the
state
and
federal
law
governing
the
mails
and
it's
not
subject
to
any
sort
of
local
option.
and
this
is
primarily
because
a
state
statute
while
it
is
evidenced
of
--
of
the
mores
of
--
of
the
community
is
not
conclusive
on
it.
like
any
state
legislature
concerned
about
matters
in
its
sphere
of
responsibility
congress
may
determine
that
certain
activities
are
pernicious.
now,
petitioner's
suggestion
that
is
applied
to
hard
core
pornography,
this
is
somehow
inconsistent
with
our
federalism.
therefore
requires
that
the
statute
be
read
to
create
a
local
option
exception,
simply
turns
federal
--
federalism
upside
down
by
making
state
legislatures
supreme
over
congress.
congress
could
make
federal
obscenity
law
subject
to
state
law,
it
hasn't
done
so.
when
it
wishes
to
do
so,
it
does
so
expressly.
this
statute
which
dates
from
1872
has
been
uniformly
construed
to
apply
across
the
nation
as
a
whole.
it
is
part
of
a
pattern
of
statutes
expressing
the
federal
interest
in
the
limitation
of
the
distribution
of
obscenity.
a
material
cannot
be
imported
even
though
the
importer
lives
in
iowa.
the
material
cannot
be
carried
by
a
common
carrier
to
a
resident
of
iowa.
it
can't
be
transported
for
purposes
of
sale
or
distribution
there.
and
under
the
--
under
this
statute,
it
cannot
be
mailed
at
all
in
iowa.
iowa,
if
it
wishes
can
permit
the
distribution
of
this
material
by
not
making
it
a
crime.
it's
iowa's
business
and
iowa's
responsibility.
the
federal
congress,
if
it
wishes,
can
also
bar
the
material
from
the
mail
either
interstate
or
intrastate.
now
the
petitioner
claims
that
the
statute
is
unduly
vague
and
is
applied
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
while
in
hamling,
the
court
clearly
indicated
what
the
statute
applies
to,
hard
core
pornography.
petitioner
was
distributing
hard
core
--
core
pornography
within
the
state.
he
was
not
committing
a
crime
under
state
law
but
he
was
certainly
on
notice
that
he
was
committing
a
crime
by
distributing
it
by
mail
and
that
is
what
he
was
convicted
for
quite
properly.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
i
think
you
do
your
honor.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
any
overbreadth
question
on
the
facts
here.
i
mean,
this
is
a
claim
of
vagueness
made
in
circumstances
where
it's
clear
that
the
statute
applies.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
i
was
responding
to
a
question
from
mr.
justice
stevens
concerning
whether
the
court
in
this
case
should
reach
the
question
of
overbreadth
and
i
--
my
answer,
as
i
stated
then
was
that,
in
this
case,
there
is
no
reason
for
the
court
to
reach
the
issue
of
overbreadth.
in
this
case,
the
facts
involved
show
clearly
that
the
defendant
is
within
the
scope
of
the
statute
as
it
was
construed
in
hamling,
the
statue,
18
u.s.c.
1461
was
construed
in
hamling
to
be
confined
to
patently
offensive
hard
core
materials.
that
is
what
is
involved
in
this
case.
that
is
what
the
petitioner
mailed.
he
was
on
notice
from
the
time
that
the
roth
decision
came
down
that
if
he
mails
such
materials,
he
would
be
violating
federal
law
so
there
is
no
reason
to
be
concerned
with
any
question
of
overbreadth.
now,
there
has
been
some
discussion
about
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
to
consider
in
reviewing
one
of
these
decisions,
the
court
in
hamling
noted
that
a
juror
was
entitled
to
call
upon
his
own
knowledge
of
community
custom
--
the
customary
candor
in
the
community.
this
decision
--
that
this
kind
of
determination
was
compared
to
a
knowledge
of
what
reasonable
conduct
is,
what
standard
of
due
care
is,
and
that's
about
all
you
can
do
in
this
area
when
you're
trying
to
determine
what
community
mores
are
to
be
sure,
a
defendant
is
entitled
if
he
wishes
to
introduce
evidence
concerning
what
community
mores
are
but
it
is
not
mandatory
that
the
government
do
so.
the
jury
--
the
juror's
knowledge
is
very
much
analogous
to
the
reasonable
man
standard.
this
comes
into
play
also
when
we
consider
the
last
issue
which
petitioner
presented
in
his
brief.
that
his
--
his
rights
were
violated
by
the
voir
dire
of
the
jury.
now
of
course,
the
questions
to
be
put
to
jurors
in
an
obscenity
case
must
assure
that
the
jurors
are
neutral
and
objective.
it's
been
said
that
--
it's
appropriate
to
inquire
within
the
limits
of
the
judge's
--
district
judge's
power
to
control
voir
dire
into
the
political
moral
and
religious
or
sexual
opinions
which
might
affect
neutrality
and
objectivity.
but
the
questions
that
the
defendant
here
wished
to
propound
to
the
jury
were
essentially,
what
do
you
know
about
community
standards,
where
did
you
learn
it?
do
you
know
about
the
iowa
statute
here?
that's
part
of
what
the
jurors
have
to
decide.
the
petitioner
can
put
in
evidence
on
that
issue
as
he
did
but
he
can't
question
the
jurors
about
their
understanding
of
these
matters
any
more
than
he
can
question
them
about
their
knowledge
of
the
case
but
the
knowledge
of
standard
of
due
care.
now
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
of
course
the
--
since
it
is
a
criminal
case
--
there's
always
a
burden
of
persuasion
on
the
government
to
establish
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
the
material
involved
defense
community
standards
within
the
miller
test.
on
the
other
hand,
the
court's
decisions
made
it
clear
there
is
no
burden
on
the
government
of
coming
forward
with
evidence
on
that
issue.
now,
i
think
the
case
can
be
summed
up
by
trying
to
decide
whether
something
that
is
offensive
necessarily
has
to
be
illegal.
the
constitutional
test
in
miller
does
not
equate
offensiveness
to
the
community
with
illegality
in
the
community.
and
that's
really
the
essence
of
our
position.
this
concept
of
community
mores
that
the
statute
involves,
that
the
miller
test
involves
simply
reflects
a
practical
and
realistic
way
of
handling
what
the
court
has
described
as
an
impractical
problem.
there
are
all
kinds
of
things
that
are
offensive
in
our
society,
lying
may
be
offensive,
using
vulgar
language
is
offensive.
these
things
offend
community
mores,
they
aren't
illegal
necessarily.
the
distribution
of
obscenity
in
iowa
to
adults
is
not
a
crime
but
it
still
may
offend
community
morals.
the
jury
in
this
case
concluded
under
the
instructions
based
on
the
miller
test
that
the
contemporary
community
standards
were
being
offended
within
the
miller
meaning.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that.
we
think
that's
all
that
the
constitution
requires
in
a
federal
prosecution.
the
defendant
had
the
advantage
of
consideration
by
the
jury
of
the
effect
of
the
federal
--
of
the
iowa
decriminalization
of
obscenity.
the
jury
concluded
as
well
it
might
that
that
did
not
mean
that
this
material
did
not
offend
community
standards,
and
so
the
defendant
was
convicted
and
so
that
conviction
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
