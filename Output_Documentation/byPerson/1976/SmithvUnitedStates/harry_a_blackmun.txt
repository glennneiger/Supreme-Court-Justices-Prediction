justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
smith,
you
represent
not
only
this
defendant
but
also
an
amicus
here,
don't
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
where
you
get
a
one-two
punch
when
you
do
this.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
tefft,
is
there
any
argument
about
the
nature
of
the
materials
here?
do
you
concede
they
were
all
hard
core
--
hard
core
stuff?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
put
it
in
another
way.
if
the
federal
statute
applies,
you
concede
that
his
subjectability
to
it
then
conviction
thereunder
would
be
proper?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
let
me
just
start
all
over
again.
my
premise
was
if
the
statute
applies
and
if
it
is
validly
applicable.
do
you
concede
that
a
conviction
thereunder
would
be
proper?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
a
matter
of
iowa
law
you're
saying.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
by
what?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
don't
raise
any
constitutional
question
but
what
the
congress
could
have
said,
whether
or
not
legal
in
the
state.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
weren't
those
both
dissenting
opinions?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
recall,
shapiro
who
the
judge
was?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
he
is
an
old
time
iowa
judge.
he
used
to
be
on
the
supreme
court
of
iowa.
that's
a
fair
reasoning.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
case
comes
to
us
by
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
petitioner,
mr.
smith,
who
does
business
as
intrigue
was
indicted
in
the
southern
of
iowa
for
mailing
obscene
materials
in
violation
of
a
federal
statute.
the
mailings
were
entirely
intrastate.
furthermore,
at
the
time
of
the
mailings,
the
iowa
obscenity
statute
then
in
effect
proscribed
the
dissemination
of
obscene
materials
only
to
minors.
the
case
went
to
trial
and
at
the
close
of
the
government's
evidence
and
later,
the
petitioner
unsuccessfully
moved
for
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
on
the
ground
that
the
restricted
iowa
obscenity
statute
set
forth
the
applicable
community
standard,
and
that
the
prosecution
have
not
proved
that
the
material
at
issue
had
offended
that
standard.
the
petitioner
never
looked
the
last
was
convicted,
and
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
in
turn
affirmed.
we
hold
that
state
law
cannot
define
the
contemporary
community
standard
or
the
appealed
of
the
prurient
interest
and
patent
offensiveness
that
under
the
case
of
miller
against
california
are
applied
in
determining
whether
or
not
material
is
obscene.
thus,
the
iowa
statute
is
not
conclusive
as
to
those
standards.
this
after
all
was
a
federal
prosecution,
and
the
issues
are
fact
questions
for
the
jury
to
be
judged
in
the
light
of
its
understanding
of
the
contemporary
community
standard.
the
state
legislature
cannot
declare
what
the
community
standard
should
be
anymore
that
they
could
undertake
to
define
the
concept
of
reasonableness
in
a
tort
case.
it
is
allright
of
course
for
the
jury
to
be
told
what
the
iowa
statute
provides.
further,
the
community
standard
aspects
of
the
statute
implicate
federal
and
not
state
law,
and
it
is
therefore
immaterial
that
the
mailings
were
only
intrastate.
this
holding
does
not
nullify
state
law.
on
the
other
hand,
the
state's
right
not
to
regulate
in
the
obscenity
field
cannot
correlatively
compel
the
united
states
to
allow
the
mails
to
be
used
to
send
obscene
materials
in
or
into
that
state.
we
further
hold
that
the
district
court
did
not
abuse
its
discretion
in
refusing
to
ask
certain
questions
tendered
by
the
petitioner
voir
dire
about
the
jurors'
understanding
of
the
community
standard.
mr.
justice
powell
while
joining
the
opinion
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
has
joined
up
by
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
justice
stevens
also
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
