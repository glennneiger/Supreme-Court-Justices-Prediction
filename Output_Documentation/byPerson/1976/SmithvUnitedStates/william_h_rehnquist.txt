mr.
smith,
what
if
the
iowa
legislature
by
a
rather
large
vote
had
passed
a
counterpart
of
the
federal
statute
and
the
governor
had
signed
it,
but
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
had
held
that
it
violated
iowa's
constitution.
what
would
your
position
be
in
that
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
then
your
--
your
argument
doesn't
depend
on
the
fact
that
a
majority
of
the
people
in
iowa
may
not
agree
with
the
federal
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
--
this
is
an
argument
of
statutory
construction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
have
any
doubt
that
if
the
federal
government
says
the
national
labor
relations
act
shall
apply
in
all
50
states
even
though
the
people
of
iowa
may
not
like
it.
it
can
nonetheless
do
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
somebody
in
iowa
who
misbrands
drugs
in
iowa,
the
iowa
legislature
has
chosen
not
to
make
that
criminally
punishable.
does
that
give
him
a
defense
to
a
federal
charge?
