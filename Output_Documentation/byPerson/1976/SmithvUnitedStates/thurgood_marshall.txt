justice
thurgood
marshall
well
then
you're
not
really
a
friend
of
the
court,
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
his
--
his
law
firm
represents
the
amicus
curiae,
i
don't
say
you
can
do
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
--
i
understand
amicus
curiae
to
mean
that
i
have
no
interest
in
the
case
itself,
but
i
want
to
see
the
court
do
the
right
thing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
the
same
firm?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it's
on
the
brief,
it
says
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
--
have
you
ever
seen
it
before
in
this
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
shapiro,
i
may
have
missed
it.
what
evidence
did
the
government
put
on
as
a
community
standards?
you
said
what
the
defendant
belong,
where'd
the
government
belong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
--
is
it
true
that
your
position
is
that
the
case
matter
is
obscene
or
not
dependent
solely
upon
the
whims
of
12
people?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
--
and
i
emphasize
solely,
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
shapiro,
maybe
i'm
wrong.
isn't
it
that
it's
left
to
the
whims
of
12
people
without
any
guidance
or
evidence
of
any
kind?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
did
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
put
on
anybody
who
have
said
that
there
is
a
single
--
there's
at
least
one
person
in
iowa
who
does
not
like
obscenity?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it's
a
community
standard
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
--
what
is
the
community
standard

justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then

--
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
next
jury
could
say
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
next
jury
can
amend
that
law
and
change
it.
