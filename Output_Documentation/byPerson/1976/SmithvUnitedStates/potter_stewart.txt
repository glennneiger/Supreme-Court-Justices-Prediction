justice
potter
stewart
yesterday,
on
a
case
that
was
argued
involving
the
intestacy
statue
of
--
statutes
of
illinois
that
--
that
exclude
the
illegitimate
children
from
a
father's
--
from
intrastate
succession
from
a
decedent
father.
we
were
told
that
the
--
the
state
law
does
not
reflect
state
public
opinion
or
community
standards.
indeed
we
were
told
that
if
all
have
shown
that
a
vast
majority
of
the
people
in
illinois
thought
that
the
--
that
state
law
was
contrary
to
what
they
thought
would
be
good
policy.
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
hasn't
congress
in
analogous
situations
when
it
wanted
to
exempt
the
force
of
federal
laws
from
operation
in
states
where
the
state
policy
was
otherwise
has
been
explicitly
so
determined?
i'm
thinking
for
example
of
--
it's
--
it's
a
violation
--
criminal
violation
of
federal
law
and
i
think
to
mail
slot
machines
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
at
interstate
commerce,
but
hasn't
congress
has
expressly
exempted
the
mailing
of
a
slot
machine
from
one
place
to
another
in
nevada,
for
example.
justice
potter
stewart
you
--
you
mr.
smith
as
i
understand
it,
would
concede
assuming
illinois
has
a
kind
of
law
as
described
by
the
chief
justice.
you
would
concede
that
this
federal
statute
would
be
applicable
to
a
mail
--
mail
shipment
from
one
point
to
another
in
illinois,
do
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it's
not
just
the
intrastate
character
of
this?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
your
argument
--
these
20
arguments
was
simply
that
the
--
as
a
matter
of
definition
of
the
offense,
there
couldn't
be
an
offense
in
--
in
your
state.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
whether
or
not
there's
been
a
bank
robbery
is
an
objectively
identifiable
question.
and
the
answer
is
that
one
could
tell
by
objective
measurements,
but
since
the
test
of
whether
or
not
there's
even
been
a
violation
in
this
kind
of
a
case
depends
upon
contemporary
community
standards.
and
since
in
the
legislature
of
this
state
is
--
as
stated
with
the
contemporary
community
standards
are
and
they
do
not
include
this,
then
there's
not
even
an
offense.
isn't
that
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
make
it
quite
different
with
the
bank
robbery
case.
justice
potter
stewart
there
cannot
even
be
an
offense.
there
can't
be
a
bank
robbery.
justice
potter
stewart
you
take
the
three
part
test
as
a
conjunctive
test
or
not
a
disjunctive
test,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
and
also
whether
or
not
the
misbranding
of
drugs,
the
violation
itself
doesn't
depend
upon
community
standards,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
very
essence
of
this
offense
as
this
court
had
said
depends
upon
whether
or
not
--
depends
upon
the
standards
of
the
community.
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
the
instructions
have
to
say
with
respect
to
community
standards,
are
they
on
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
what
more
reliable
evidence
is
there
of
the
mores
of
community
than
the
--
than
the
laws
of
its
elective
--
elected
representatives?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
wouldn't
we
have
mores
here
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
mores
which
means
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
customs
or
standards?
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
they
smoked
marijuana
doesn't
depend
whatsoever
on
the
community?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now
you
--
you've
told
us
that
the
iowa
law
was
admissible
and
evident?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
in
your
view?
justice
potter
stewart
in
a
federal
prosecution
for
possession
of
marijuana,
would
it
be
--
would
the
absence
of
a
state
criminal
law
--
criminalizing
the
possession
of
marijuana
be
admissible
and
evident?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
difference?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
--
you
said
the
basic
question
was
whether
this
material
is
or
is
not
obscene,
“obscene”.
justice
potter
stewart
within
a
meaning
of
the
federal
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
and
hasn't
it
been
determined
that
whether
or
not
material
is
obscene,
it
depends
at
least
--
it
depends
among
other
things
upon
whether
or
not
it
offends
community
standards
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
--
and
if
the
community
has
said
through
its
elected
representatives
that
it
does
offend
our
community
standards,
isn't
that
the
end
of
it?
