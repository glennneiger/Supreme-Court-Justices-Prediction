mr.
tefft
w.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
it
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
tefft
smith
representing
the
petitioner,
jerry
lee
smith.
i
wish
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
this
case
concerns
the
proper
relationship
between
federal
and
state
law
in
the
obscenity
area.
petitioner
submits
that
this
case
can
be
simply
disposed
of
and
the
constitutional
issues
avoided
by
the
logical
interpretation
of
the
federal
statute
as
being
intended
to
support
state
policy
and
thus
as
incorporating
the
state
law
definition
of
obscenity
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
the
petitioner,
jerry
lee
smith
was
convicted
by
a
jury
in
the
souther
district
of
iowa
and
sentenced
to
six
months
imprisonment
under
the
federal
statute
proscribing
the
mailing
of
obscene
matter.
he
was
convicted
for
mailings
which
took
place
solely
within
the
state
of
iowa.
these
mailings
were
lawful
within
iowa.
iowa
law
permits
the
distribution
of
all
sexually
related
material
to
iowa
adults
prescribing
solely
the
distribution
of
certain
specified
materials
to
minors.
the
case
here
involves
no
distribution
to
minors.
the
distributions
involved
were
made
exclusively
to
postal
inspectors
who
directly
solicited
the
material.
hence,
these
distributions
were
totally
permissible
under
the
law
of
the
state
in
which
they
took
place.
at
trial,
the
government
offered
no
evidence
of
any
contrary
standard.
nonetheless,
the
court
permitted
the
jury
to
determine
for
itself
what
were
the
community
standards.
we
submit
this
was
error.
the
federal
statute
should
be
construed
in
the
present
circumstances
as
incorporating
iowa
law
as
the
measure
of
obscenity.
that
statute
precludes
as
a
matter
of
law
any
finding
that
the
materials
involved
here
are
obscene.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
yes.
our
firm
represents
the
american
library
association
which
has
filed
an
extensive
amicus
brief
in
this
case.
but
i
am
here
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
himself
and
my
argument
is
directed
to
the
petitioner's
position,
although
i
am
prepared
to
discuss
of
course
the
--
the
amicus
brief.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
well,
that's
one
of
the
advantages,
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
i
am
here
representing
mr.
jerry
lee
smith,
the
petitioner
here.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be
--
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
well,
your
honor,
as
you
will
note
from
the
briefs,
the
amicus
brief
was
prepared
by
mr.
north
and
that
i
had
the
principal
responsibility
for
preparing
--
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
it
is
the
same
law
firm,
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
i'm
not
certain
that
i
have
ever,
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
federal
statute
here
at
issue
was
enacted
in
1873.
the
statute
was
enacted
with
almost
no
debate,
it
contains
no
statement
of
purpose,
and
it
provides
no
definition
of
what
is
obscene
matter.
the
statute
has
subsequently
been
reenacted
on
a
number
of
occasions
but
it
has
never
been
significantly
revised,
substantially
debated,
and
no
definition
of
the
meaning
of
obscene
matter
has
ever
been
provided.
instead,
the
congress
has
left
that
matter
to
judicial
resolution
by
this
court.
this
court
in
the
miller
decision
and
those
that
have
followed
has
firmly
stated
that
the
issue
of
obscenity
is
one
of
local
concern,
not
national
concern.
within
the
traditional
state
jurisdiction,
the
court
has
rejected
any
need
for
national
uniformity
in
this
area
and
stated
that
the
obscenity
or
non-obscenity
of
materials
should
be
measured
by
contemporary
community
standards
within
the
community
in
which
the
distribution
has
its
effect.
in
that
the
state
legislatures
are
institutionally
the
voice
of
the
people
for
setting
community
standards,
the
court
has
recognized
that
the
individual
states
have
considerable
latitude
in
determining
what
their
community
standard
shall
be.
indeed,
the
court
has
expressly
recognized
that
states
have
the
option
of
doing
precisely
what
the
state
of
iowa
has
done
here.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
in
that
case,
i
believe,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
the
situation
would
be
that
there
had
not
been
as
enacted
through
the
governmental
structure
of
iowa,
a
statute
which
expressed
the
intent
of
the
state
government
which
gives
the
repository
for
the
declaration
of
society's
values
to
have
obscenity
proscribed
within
the
state.
and
in
those
circumstances,
the
remedy
for
the
disagreement
that
any
--
that
the
community
and
the
legislatures
would
have
in
those
circumstances
would
be
the
ballot
box.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
a
majority
of
the
people
within
the
state
of
iowa
speak
through
their
elected
representatives.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
well,
he
would
not
be
subject
to
prosecution
of
course
under
the
statute
here
which
is
the
federal
mail
statute
but
--
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
--
he
would
be
engaged
--
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
he
would
be
taking
that
material
into
another
state
whose
community
standards
would
be
different.
and
in
that
circumstance
under
those
community
standards
if
they
were
deemed
to
apply
that
material
would
be
proscribable.
that
conduct
could
be
deemed
proscribable
and
i
believe
that
the
section
1462
of
the
federal
code
would
imply
for
interstate
distribution
--
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
that's
correct.
the
state
of
illinois
could
protect
its
own
interest
in
that
situation.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
that's
correct.
here
--
and
that's
critical
to
our
case.
the
distribution
took
place
solely
from
one
point
in
iowa
into
another
point
in
iowa.
and
therefore,
there
can
be
no
question
of
any
other
standard
applying
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
there
was
no
distribution
anywhere
else
outside
of
that
state.
but
suppose
--
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
well,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
phrase
“hard
core”
is
something
that
has
no
legal
meaning.
it's
simply
a
code
word
for
some
material.
we
don't
concede
that
this
material
is
anything
other
than
sexually
related
material
as
to
whether
it's
hard
core
or
not.
the
issue
here
is
a
question
of
obscenity
and
obscenity
is
a
legal
concept
which
requires
a
measurement
in
accordance
with
the
three
elements
set
forth
in
miller,
subject
to
the
contemporary
community
standards.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
no,
because
that
is
our
second
argument,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
which
is
that
the
application
of
this
statute
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
where
state
law
has
permitted
the
conduct,
would
involve
fundamental
due
process
considerations.
therefore,
if
the
--
as
statutory
interpretation
question,
it
is
decided
--
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
no.
we
would
submit
that
these
materials
are
not
obscene
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
as
a
matter
of
iowa
law
and
therefore,
as
a
matter
of
--
and
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
we
do
not
concede
the
obscenity
of
these
materials
as
that
concept
is
defined
by
the
court.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
by
the
court,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
this
court
recognizing
the
absence
of
any
need
and
indeed
the
absence
of
any
congressionally
expressed
desire
for
national
uniformity
in
this
area
has
expressly
applied
the
contemporary
community
standards
approach
to
federal
prosecutions.
that
was
the
express
holding
in
the
hamling
case.
in
these
circumstances,
we
submit
that
the
iowa's
statutory
decision
here
constitutes
those
contemporary
community
standards
and
should
be
applied
in
the
circumstances
of
a
federal
prosecution
for
a
distribution
solely
within
the
state
of
iowa.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
well,
i
would
submit,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
that
this
is
an
improper
statement,
because
the
remedy
for
disagreement
between
the
people
is
the
ballot
box.
that's
the
essential
nature
of
a
democratic
republic.
in
our
brief,
we
quote
from
james
madison
in
federalist
number
10
where
that
proposition
was
definitively
stated
at
the
outset
of
the
formation
of
this
nation.
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
it
is
the
legislators
and
through
the
legislatures,
following
up
on
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
point,
the
--
then
further
given
our
system
of
checks
and
balances,
the
application
of
the
governor
in
those
situations
to
decide
what
is
to
be
the
society,
that
society's
values.
now,
our
argument
is
consistent
with
the
doctrine
of
cooperative
federalism
which
has
been
well
articulated
by
this
court.
in
our
federalist
system,
federal
law
is
interstitial
in
nature.
often
being
incomplete,
not
having
considered
all
circumstances.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
that
is
correct.
it
is
therefore
been
appropriate
to
evaluate
and
interpret
the
meanings
of
federal
law
with
reference
to
the
backdrop
of
state
law.
as
the
case
has
discussed
in
our
brief
at
pages
23
to
30
demonstrate,
the
court
has
in
the
past
often
looked
to
state
law
to
determine
the
meaning
of
congressional
enactments,
particularly
in
the
circumstances
presented
here
where
the
matters
at
issue
are
considered
local
in
nature
and
there
has
been
no
demonstrated
need
for
national
uniformity.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
well
--
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
congress
has
taken
this
approach
in
certain
of
its
more
recent
statutory
enactments,
but
the
decisions
that
we
cite
and
discussed
in
our
brief
do
not
involve
situations
where
there
was
an
express
congressional
intent.
moreover,
in
the
relatively
recent
decision
of
mr.
justice
marshall
in
united
states
versus
bass,
the
court
expressly
refused
to
extend
the
prescriptions
under
the
federal
statute
proscribing
the
possession
of
handguns
by
a
convicted
felon
to
an
intrastate
possession
absent
some
clear
manifestation
of
congressional
intent.
mr.
justice
marshall
emphasized
in
his
opinion
in
that
circumstance
that
the
absence
of
any
comment
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
the
statute
on
this
subject
matter
should
be
deemed
persuasive.
here
--
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
that
is
correct.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
no
the
significance
as
i
tried
to
articulate
early
of
the
--
earlier
of
the
intrastate
element
here
is
solely
that
--
only
one
standard
here
can
possibly
be
determined
to
be
at
issue.
it
can
be
solely
the
iowa
standard
that
we
have
to
evaluate.
and
that's
the
only
standard
that
the
jury
could
have
been
instructed
to
apply
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
well,
we
do
raise
and
that
is
our
second
argument
that
there
are
fundamental
notice
problems
in
that
circumstances.
again,
referring
back
to
the
decision
in
united
states
versus
bass,
the
court
there,
although
that
was
not
the
factual
situation
in
that
case,
noted
that
there
would
be
real
notice
problems
in
any
application
of
federal
law
to
--
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
no.
i
would
not.
that
is
due
process
argument
and
a
notice
argument.
here,
no
federal
interest
can
possibly
be
deemed
to
be
served
by
this
prosecution.
the
court
in
evaluating
the
question
of
the
nature
of
obscenity
has
identified
no
federal
interest.
mr.
justice
harlan
in
dissenting
in
the
roth
case
expressly
rejected
any
notion
of
an
independent
federal
interest
emphasizing
instead
the
paramount
obligation
of
the
federal
government
to
assure
full
protection
of
first
amendment
rights.
justice
harlan
in
dissenting
in
the
memoirs
case
articulated
what
we
would
submit
is
the
logical
and
most
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
federal
statute.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
both
of
those
were
dissenting
opinions,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
in
the
memoirs
dissent,
mr.
justice
harlan
stated
that
there
would
be
a
limited
federal
interest
in
prescribing
certain
materials
for
the
purpose
of
assuring
that
federal
instrumentalities
like
the
mails
would
not
be
utilized
to
thwart
state
law.
in
the
circumstances
presented
here,
the
interpretation
adopted
below
and
urged
by
the
government
is
precisely
the
opposite
that
it
thwarts
state
law.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
not
if
the
federal
statute
had
manifested
a
clear
intent
that
there
were
legitimate
federal
interest
that
were
involved
here
and
were
concerned
here
as
with
--
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
no,
because
there
is
no
expression
within
the
statute
of
any
intent
and
indeed,
the
nature
of
the
subject
matter
as
recognized
by
this
court
is
such,
that
it's
a
matter
of
local
concern
that
there
are
no
national
interests
here.
indeed,
the
very
purpose
that
was
articulated
by
mr.
chief
justice
himself
in
the
miller
case
for
eliminating
the
national
standard
was
precisely
--
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
standard.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
that's
correct.
and
that
the
thrust
of
that
reasoning,
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
chief
justice
is,
that
you
should
permit
materials
to
be
distributed
in
a
local
community
where
they
are
acceptable
and
in
the
circumstances
where
the
state
legislature
has
evaluated
the
matter
and
as
a
legislative
policy
judgment.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
well
--
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
i
think
it's
somewhat
the
logic
of
my
position,
although
i
would
submit
that
the
differences
here
are
of
course
that
what
we're
concerned
with
is
further
the
question
of
the
impact
of
these
rulings
on
first
amendment
rights,
the
--
the
serious
notice
problems
that
are
involved
in
applying
a
federal
proscription
to
conduct
which
is
lawful
at
state
law
--
under
state
law.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
that
is
correct.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
i
certainly
would
agree
with
everything,
mr.
justice
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
yes,
it
does.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
the
bank
robbery
--
robbery
situation
involves
a
question
of
conduct
where
this
--
the
issue
here
that
we're
concerned
with
is
a
question
of
how
do
you
evaluate
the
standards
in
determining
what
that
conduct
has
been.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
well,
mr.
justice
stevens,
we
would
submit
that
that
is
a
distortion
of
the
miller
decision.
and
the
opinion
of
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
miller
decision
states
as
its
summary,
we
hold
that
obscenity,
and
that's
on
page
37
of
the
opinion,
states
that
we
hold
that
obscenity,
utilizing
the
broad
word
“obscenity”
is
to
be
determined
by
applying
contemporary
community
standards,
not
national
standards.
that
--
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
yes.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
that
they
are
--
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
the
three
independent
elements
must
conjoin
for
a
finding
of
obscenity.
moreover,
the
subsequent
opinion
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
hamling
repeatedly
refers
to
the
contemporary
community
standards
test
as
broadly
applying
to
the
concept
of
obscenity.
similarly,
the
opinion
in
the
jenkins
versus
georgia
case
so
refers
expressly
referring
to
the
two
first
two
test
of
prurient
interest
and
patently
offensive
appeal.
the
--
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
miller
case,
in
rejecting
the
national
standards
approach
expressly
stated
that
there
will
be
varying
from
community
to
community
standards
of
precisely
--
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
30
of
the
opinion,
“of
precisely
what
appeals
to
the
prurient
interest
or
is
patently
offensive.”
the
history
of
the
formulation
of
the
patent
offensiveness
test
further
confirms
this
fact.
in
that
--
when
it
was
first
fully
articulated
by
mr.
justice
brennan
in
the
memoirs
case,
he
stated
that
material
is
patently
offensive
because
it
affronts
contemporary
community
standards
relating
to
the
description
of
representation
of
sexual
matters.
hence,
within
the
court's
own
formulations
and
moreover
within
the
logic
of
why
it
is
that
you
prescribe
obscenity
is
where
it
is
offensive
to
the
community.
if
it's
not
offensive
to
the
community,
it
is
not
obscene.
the
result
that
occurred
below
and
as
urged
by
the
government
expressly
has
certain
adverse
consequences.
first,
it
effectively
nullifies
iowa
law
and
by
the
same
logic,
the
laws
of
at
least
six
other
states.
the
court
has
recognized
in
lamont
versus
postmaster
general
that
the
u.s.
mails
have
a
predominant
influence
in
the
nation.
whatever
the
court
stated,
whatever
may
have
been
the
voluntary
nature
of
the
postal
system
in
the
period
of
its
establishment,
it
is
now
the
main
artery
through
which
the
business,
social,
and
personal
affairs
of
the
people
are
conducted.
hence,
the
federal
statute
would
become
the
dominant
statute.
indeed,
in
the
circumstances
here,
that
result
runs
directly
contrary
to
what
the
court
has
repeatedly
stated
is
the
right
of
the
individual
state
legislatures.
two,
take
the
course
followed
by
the
state
of
iowa
and
to
choose
to
permit
the
regulation,
the
distribution
of
all
sexually
related
material
to
their
citizenry.
the
further
adverse
consequence
of
this
decision,
and
we
would
submit
that
the
--
that
this
constitutional
issue
of
notice
can
be
avoided
by
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
which
we
submit
is
the
fundamental
fairness
consideration
that
a
person
has
a
legitimate
expectation
that
if
he
conducts
himself
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
his
--
the
state
of
his
residence,
his
conduct
there
will
not
lead
him
to
criminal
prescription.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
--
and
to
criminal
imprisonment.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
not
in
a
situation
where
again
the
federal
government
has
expressly
enacted
a
statute
which
has
its
own
standards
that
govern
that
conduct.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
no.
and
that
is
the
--
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
yes,
that
is
true.
especially,
in
evaluating
conduct.
but
this
court
has
very
carefully
stated
--
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
well,
the
--
mr.
chief
justice,
there
are
standards
provided
in
those
kinds
of
statutes.
the
jury
is
not
free
at
its
will
to
exercise
whatever
its
judgment
on
the
morality
or
immorality
of
the
conduct
is.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
but
jurors
must
be
required
to
consider
things
objectively.
and
here,
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
and
under
this
court's
precedence
had
been
directly
decided
that
the
jury
must
apply
an
objective
test
based
upon
the
community's
standards
of
the
average
person
in
the
community.
they're
not
supposed
to
apply
their
own
standards.
they're
supposed
to
apply
the
standards
that
prevail
within
the
community.
mr.
tefft
w.
smith
i
think
that
it
is
an
issue
of
law
in
the
present
circumstances
of
this
case
in
that,
the
iowa
legislature
has
enacted
a
legal
pronouncement
on
that
issue.
thank
you.
