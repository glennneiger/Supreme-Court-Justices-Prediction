justice
john
paul
stevens
general
bork,
do
you
think
it
would
be
constitutional
for
congress
to
provide
with
respect
to
state
prisoners
that
there
shall
be
no
habeas
corpus
petition
entertained
unless
the
federal
court
first
determines
that
the
state
collateral
attack
procedure
was
ineffective.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
your
answer
one
way
would
control
this
case
as
well.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
you
rely
on
this
ineffective
exception
in
the
statutory
language
here
in
one
of
your
answers
and
then
we
go.
what
i
am
saying
is
if
that
is
an
adequate
answer
that
in
another
way
last
phrase
in
the
statute
you
just
refer
to
then
would
take
care
of
the
whole
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
freed
of
2255
really,
freed
of
2254
really.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that’s
right,
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
not
be
regarded
as
the
suspension
of
the
writ,
because
the
office
of
the
writ
would
be
performed
by
the
state
system
whereas
here
it
is
performed
by
the
district
of
columbia
system.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
swain
against
pressley,
the
respondent
is
in
custody
pursuant
to
a
sentence
imposed
by
the
superior
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
he
has
filed
an
application
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
asking
that
court
to
review
the
constitutionality
of
the
proceedings
that
led
to
his
conviction
and
sentence.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
§110(g)
of
the
district
of
columbia
code
prevents
the
district
court
from
entertaining
the
application.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
held
that
the
district
court
should
entertain
the
application.
we
anonymously
reversed
because
we
find
that
the
statutory
language
plainly
bars
the
application.
the
reasons
for
our
decision
are
set
forth
in
an
opinion
which
contains
two
parts.
all
the
members
of
the
court
have
joined
part
one
of
the
opinion.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
which
is
joined
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
which
does
not
join
the
second
part
of
the
court's
opinion
but
does
join
the
judgment.
