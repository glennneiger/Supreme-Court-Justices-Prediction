unknown
speaker
it
was
no
different
standards
mainly
is
the
defendant
and
a
federal
defendant.
unknown
speaker
sometimes
it
protects
quite
an
undertaken
to
prove
that
the
congress
did
not
intend
what
it
said.
unknown
speaker
mr.
foster,
you
can
see
that
none
of
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
is
against
you.
unknown
speaker
there
is
an
addition
to
the
plain
language.
unknown
speaker
now,
when
they
use
languages
like
that
maybe
congress
did
not
think
it
needed
to
leave
a
lot
of
trails
behind.
unknown
speaker
so
you
will
get
to
that
i
am
sure.
unknown
speaker
did
they
cite
you
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
it
sounds
that
that
is
in
the
reference
to
eliminating
unnecessary
litigation
also
cover
the
situation
where
you
only
have
one
collateral
attack
instead
of
two.
precisely,
what
the
government
at
least
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
well,
it
cannot
be
both,
the
restate
existing
law
and
also
change
law
on
the
second
part
eliminating
unnecessary
procedures
necessarily
applies
the
change,
doesn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
i
am
little
puzzled
on
how
you
deal
with
the
reference
to
eliminating
unnecessary
litigation.
unknown
speaker
mr.
foster
i
gather
your
position
isn’t
that
you
go
directly
to
the
united
states
district
court
with
the
petition
of
habeas
corpus.
unknown
speaker
now,
must
you
go
to
local
court
first.
unknown
speaker
but
under
that
statute,
right
now
under
the
statute
that
you
are
operating
under
must
you
go
if
you
want
collateral
attack
must
you
file
your
petition
with
the
trial
court.
unknown
speaker
would
if
he
privileged
to
file?
unknown
speaker
well
then
neither
clause
of
the
statute
means
anything
in
your
view
of
that
part
of
110,
either
the
requirement
that
he
make
a
motion
for
relief
for
that
not
be
denied?
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
that
is
presented
in
the
trial
as
enough?
unknown
speaker
on
direct
appeal?
unknown
speaker
well,
let’s
assume
he
does
present
his
issues
on
direct
appeal
and
they
are
fully
aired
denial.
now,
under
this
statute
you
say
that
he
would
have
the
right
that
he
maybe
and
wouldn’t
have
to
for
exhaustion,
but
he
would
have
the
right
to
file
a
collateral
petition
with
the
local
court.
unknown
speaker
and
have
them
rule
on
it.
unknown
speaker
and
then
i
think
that’s
more
than
the
state
prisoners
get
in
similar
circumstances,
but
most
state
collateral
procedures
are
not
available
if
the
issues
have
been
presented
on
direct
review.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
say
that
the
congress
intended
to
give
this
fellow
the
right
to
go
to
two
courts
even
though
he
has
presented
the
issues
in
direct
appeal,
you
are
arguing
for
much
more
in
the
state
prisoners
to
get
lots
of
states.
unknown
speaker
when
they
say
they
are
trying
to
avoid
unnecessary
litigations?
unknown
speaker
mr.
foster,
may
i
just
ask
you
a
question
right
before
this
statute
was
passed
was
it
the
practice
in
the
article
iii
court
sitting
in
the
district
to
require
exhaustion
in
the
district
of
columbia
court?
unknown
speaker
they
whether
or
not
required
by
statute
they
treated
his
all
section
via
2254
applied
in
the
district?
unknown
speaker
i
was
thinking
if
that
were
the
practice
then
normally
to
codify
existing
law
would
have
been
to
grab
the
paragraph
comparable
to
2254
(b)
rather
than
one
comparable
to
2255.
unknown
speaker
when
the
superior
court
setup
the
court
was
setup
at
the
same
time
it
was
not
before
that,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
there
were
in
superior
court.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
how
does
that
relate
to
what
kind
of
a
judge
must
hear?
unknown
speaker
you
think
the
superior
court
judge
is
less
confident
to
evaluate
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
on
a
district
judge?
unknown
speaker
now,
you
are
getting
under
equal
protection,
which
--
do
you
accept
the
solicitor
general’s
characterization
that
you
were
reemphasizing
your
equal
protection
argument?
unknown
speaker
tell
me
that
could
be
emphasized
to
that
thing?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
so.
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general
want
this
court
has
decided
that
article
i
court
can
convict
you
legally
and
constitutionally.
unknown
speaker
my
point
was
that
the
conviction
in
an
article
i
court
is
legal.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
asked
you
in
the
previous
one.
unknown
speaker
but
not
constitutionally
sufficient
to
hear.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
all
the
federal
courts,
the
lowest
if
you
take
the
district
court
has
the
third
tier.
unknown
speaker
but
you
include
this
courts
of
massachusetts
in
that?
unknown
speaker
on
article
iii
but
they
have
the
very
elements
of
the
tenure
that
you
are
talking
about
constitution
the
federal?
unknown
speaker
and
you
have
lost
me
there,
couldn’t
the
people
of
this
country
amend
the
constitution
and
give
all
federal
judges
a
tenure
term.
unknown
speaker
the
question
if
you
heard
when
you
are
running
to
this
problems,
and
if
the
difference
is
great
enough
to
make
the
article
i
file
an
ineffective
remedy
then
you
have
statutory
protection
in
the
last
clause
and
the
statute
that
the
decrees
unless
it
also
appears
that
the
remedy
by
motion
is
inadequate
or
ineffective
then
you
are
not
heard.
but
if
it
is
a
lesser
difference
to
that
you
then
have
to
say
it
is
a
total
suspension.
unknown
speaker
have
the
state
court
prisoners
have
a
federal
habeas
corpus
available
in
some
1789?
unknown
speaker
when
did
they?
unknown
speaker
so
that
your
argument
really
doe
not
prove
that
the
constitution
was
absolutely
clear
on
this
point.
unknown
speaker
is
another
way
of
phrasing
that
to
say
was
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
suspended
during
the
first
80
years
of
this
country’s
history?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
is
there
any
evidence
in
any
decision
of
this
court
prior
to
say
after
the
civil
war
that
even
a
federal
prisoner
could
bring
a
collateral
attack
on
a
final
judgment
of
a
court
of
the
confident
jurisdiction
under
the
relief
available
in
the
first
habeas
act?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
talking
about
being
held
by
power
of
the
united
states;
i
am
talking
about
a
case
from
this
court,
which
said
federal
habeas
prior
to
the
civil
war
would
reach
a
final
judgment
of
a
court
of
confident
jurisdiction
of
united
states.
unknown
speaker
where
you
get
military
courts
in
the
article
i?
military
courts
are
temporary
courts.
they
are
not
appointed
for
any
time.
unknown
speaker
why
did
it
authorize
the
file
suits?
the
district
of
columbia
against
joe
doe
united
states
against
joe
doe?
unknown
speaker
if
they
wanted
to
make
it
a
state,
and
just
on
the
judicial
side
then
you
would
file
the
case
of
the
district
of
columbia
against
the
defendant.
but
they
did
as
in
united
states
against
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
at
least
they
did
in
the
same,
in
the
judiciary
to
make
a
state.
unknown
speaker
well
that
is
out
of
state.
unknown
speaker
mr.
foster
is
it
any
part
of
your
argument
that
to
--
is
through
the
statute
the
way
the
government
will
have
it
construed
would
lead
to
a
constitutionally
inadequate
relief
under
110
(g)
as
compared
with
article
iii
not
only
in
terms
of
the
district
of
columbia
judges
being
article
i
judges
with
non-tenure,
and
non
financial
security.
but
in
terms
of
the
possibly
inadequate
freedom
of
a
district
of
columbia
judge
to
consider
a
constitutional
claim
compared
to
an
article
iii
judge
and
let
me
give
you
case
to
illustrate
with
not
what
my
question
goes
to.
let
us
assume
my
conviction
in
the
superior
court
and
appeal
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
on
some
constitutional
claim
by
the
defendant
and
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
rejects
the
claim
that
affirms
the
conviction.
the
defendant
then
comes
into
the
superior
court
under
110
(g)
making
the
same
constitutional
claim
would
not
be
superior
court
field
absolutely
bound
to
reject
that
claim
by
contrast
with
an
article
iii
court,
which
would
not
be
bound
by
the
decision
of
the
president
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals.
but
it
would
be
free
to
consider
the
claim
and
accept
it
on
the
merits
by
contrast
with
the
superior
court
under
110
(g),
is
that
any
part
of
the
argument?
unknown
speaker
i
have
not
made
a
statement
that
is
a
question.
unknown
speaker
by
our
court
of
appeals
on
direct
appeal.
unknown
speaker
in
an
article
iii
court
and
the
district
of
columbia
would
not
--
its
hands
would
not
be
similarly
tied
i
assume,
its
reviewing
court
have
not
yet
spoken.
unknown
speaker
and
so
it
is
not
only
the
complaint
that
the
article
i
courts
are
staffed
by
judges
who
do
not
have
tenure
and
do
not
have
salary
protection,
but
also
that
there
might
be
a
constitutionally
less
adequate
remedy
for
that
reason.
unknown
speaker
i
did
not
see
that
precise
argument
in
your
brief,
but
you
have
answered
my
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
claim
that
mr.
justice
stewart
has
suggested
that
you
urge
as
to
the
unconstitutionality,
because
of
the
inability
of
the
superior
court
to
freely
voice
its
view
with
the
local
court
of
appeals
is
always
spoken.
is
that
situation
any
different
in
the
federal
prisoner
earlier
convicted
in
federal
court
seeing
the
fourth
circuit
that
he
goes
into
the
district
court
in
richmond
and
says
i
want
federal
habeas
i
was
denied
certain
rights
in
the
district
court
in
richmond
says,
well
i
may
think
you
were,
but
the
fourth
circuit
considered
these
same
claims
on
direct
appeal
and
turned
it
down.
that
article
iii
judges
are
free
to
rethink
the
thing.
unknown
speaker
the
law
(inaudible)
judges
are
presumably
bound
by
the
appellate
reviewing
courts,
they
are
not.
