mr.
mark
w.
foster
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
mark
foster
and
i
represent
the
respondent
jasper
c.
pressley.
mr.
pressley
contends
here
in
this
court
today
as
he
has
from
the
day
when
he
was
arrested
back
in
1971
that
he
is
innocent
of
the
charges,
which
he
was
convicted
in
this
case,
and
it
given
the
reasonably
effective
assistance
of
an
attorney
that
he
can
establish
that
he
is
not
guilty
of
these
charges,
and
the
merits
of
his
claim
and
that
he
was
denied
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
are
not
before
this
court.
not
before
this
court
because
when
mr.
pressley
went
to
the
federal
district
courts,
the
article
iii
courts
in
the
district
of
columbia
to
present
his
federal
constitutional
questions.
he
found
that
the
doors
of
the
courthouse
were
closed
against
him,
and
to
say
that
his
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
dismissed
for
one
jurisdiction.
now,
let
me
ask
the
court
to
consider
this
dismissal
on
jurisdictional
grounds
in
the
context
which
arises.
there
is
a
general
federal
statute
that
says
by
in
his
terms
that
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
the
district
court
here
in
this
district
like
all
other
united
states
district
courts
has
the
jurisdiction
to
hear
habeas
corpus
petitions
on
behalf
of
persons
who
are
in
confinement
by
color
under
the
authority
of
the
united
states.
there
is
an
affirmative
statute
which
grants
in
that
jurisdiction.
now,
according
to
the
government
and
tucked
away
and
a
remote
corner
of
the
new
district
of
columbia
court
is
a
statute
which
cause
out
a
small
exception
and
to
the
general
federal
statute
and
that
statute
is
the
statute
which
is
before
this
court
today
under
23
d.c
code
110
(g).
judge
tam(ph)
and
joined
by
writing
for
eight
judges
of
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
district
of
columbia
circuit
found
that
the
statute
did
not
have
the
effect
that
the
government
urges
upon
this
court
and
judge
tam
and
the
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
government’s
argument
suffers
from
two
principle
license.
the
first
is
that
they
force
upon
this
statute
and
result
that
congress
never
intended
and
let
me
take
exception
with
the
respected
solicitor
general
this
court
has
said
that
there
can
be
no
rule
of
law
which
requires
that
a
statute
be
given
in
effect
that
congress
never
intended
no
matter
how
clear
the
words
may
appear
on
their
surface
and
the
second
base
found
by
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
mark
w.
foster
i
think
it
is
often
difficult
task
your
honor
but
this
is
an
area
particular
where
this
court
has
felt
that
incumbent
upon
the
court
to
examine
these
statute
of
great
care
as
they
worked
together
and
in
the
context
of
protection
of
federal
rights
and
in
many
instances
this
court
has
said,
this
language
cannot
be
read
literally,
it
must
be
read
in
context,
and
i
am
only
asking
the
court
to
apply
that
same
general
--
i
believe
there
is
a
tradition
of
interpretation
of
federal
habeas
corpus
statutes
that
they
will
be
examined
closely
to
make
sure
that
they
are
given
the
effective
congress
intended.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
your
honor,
i
do
not
feel
there
is
any
grammatical
reading
of
these
words,
which
yields
the
result
that
i
desire.
however,
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
sits
to
decide
questions
of
grammar
and
sits
to
decide
questions
of
law,
and
the
question
is
in
the
context
of
these
statutes
does
the
statute
have
the
effect
of
the
government
urges.
i
think,
one
thing
must
be
clear,
and
that
is
that
when
one
looks
to
congress
as
expressed
intention
in
passing
the
statute
there
is
no
thread
of
evidence
that
congress
intended
this
statute
to
have
the
effect
that
the
government
urges
upon
this
court.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
outside
the
parameters
of
the
statute
to
be
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
that
might
be
true
your
honor
except
the
congress
explain
that
with
some
clarity
what
it
did
think
the
statute
did
and
that
--
mr.
mark
w.
foster
that
is
in
fact
where
i
hope
i
am
your
honor.
the
legislative
history
i
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
is
not
lengthy
in
this
case,
but
its
brevity
gives
it
some
clarity.
let
me
review
how
this
statute
rose.
there
had
been
hearings
going
on,
it
was
considerable
debate
as
to
the
possibility
of
reorganizing
the
courts
in
the
district
of
columbia.
the
justice
department
came
forward
with
a
proposal
for
the
reorganization
of
the
courts
in
the
district
of
columbia.
this
statute
was
a
part
of
the
justice
department’s
proposal
to
congress.
the
justice
department
explained
to
congress
what
the
statute
meant
and
congress
adopted
the
justice
department’s
words,
explanation
of
what
the
statute
meant
in
so
many
words,
and
the
exact
words
which
were
picked
up
from
the
report
that
accompanied
the
statute
when
it
represented
the
congress
and
carried
on
through
the
senate,
through
the
house,
through
the
conference
report
are
these.
section
110
is
new,
rather
than
relying
upon
the
inherent
power
of
the
superior
court
to
review
judgments
of
conviction.
the
news
that
section
provides
statutory
procedures
for
post-conviction
challenges.
section
110
is
modeled
upon
28
u.s.c.
section
2255
with
only
the
necessary
technical
changes.
now,
to
the
trained
eye
to
someone
who
is
familiar
with
post-conviction
law
on
the
district
of
columbia
that
legislative
history
speaks
very
clearly.
it
refers
to
two
cases.
the
first
is
the
case
of
burke
v.
united
states
where
the
old
article
i
courts
in
the
district
of
columbia
talking
about
whether
or
not
they
had
the
power
to
review
their
own
judgments
of
conviction
said,
the
power
of
the
juvenile
court
to
vacate
sentence
maybe
regarded
as
inherent.
the
very
words
that
appear
in
the
legislative
history
and
again
in
the
ingle’s
case
the
court
said
the
municipal
court
has
inheritance
power
to
vacate
a
sentence.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
cannot
give
you
a
citation
in
that
form
in
this
context;
those
cases
are
discussed
in
the
legislative
history.
there
is
no
discussion
on
any
aspect
of
any
of
these
constitutional
questions
that
we
think
are
started
at
a
later
point.
i
think
if
you
turn
to
the
oral
presentation
that
the
deputy
attorney
general
and
mr.
clindings
(ph)
gave
when
he
presented
this
bill,
the
reference
becomes
even
clear.
he
said
that
title
iv
which
this
sections
are
part
just
sort
of
a
general
grab
bag
of
miscellaneous
investigators
of
the
united
states
attorney
serving
our
codefendant’s
consecutive
sentences.
he
said
this
title,
most
of
the
sections
are
merely
restatements
of
existing
law
and
wherever
appropriate
the
language
of
federal
statutes
or
federal
rule
has
been
used
and
then
when
he
got
to
110
in
particular
he
said,
although
the
local
court
may
have
inherent
power
in
the
matter
of
post-conviction
remedies
a
special
procedure
was
created
to
eliminate
unnecessary
litigation
and
to
add
certainty
to
law.
once
again
that
has
an
obvious
reference
to
the
burke
case.
it
was
suggested
by
counsel
in
the
burke
case
that
the
court
if
it
relied
upon
its
inherent
powers
to
review
judgments
would
lead
counsel
in
litigants
with
no
guidance,
and
the
court
should
suggest
some
rules
and
some
procedures
and
the
court
declined
to
do
so
in
the
burke
case.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
that
would
be
true
if
the
first
part
of
this
statement
did
not
exist
that
the
sections
here
are
restatements
of
existing
law
and
there
is
no
way
that
in
the
context
of
this
being
a
restatement
of
existing
law.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
we
argue
that
what
they
were
doing
was
not
changing
the
law,
but
simply
codifying
what
was
an
inherent
or
a
common
law
procedure
and
therefore
there
is
no
change.
it
is
in
fact
the
restatement
of
the
laws
that
existed
in
the
district
of
columbia,
which
was
at
the
superior
court
the
article
i
courts
in
the
district
of
columbia
have
the
power
to
review
their
own
judgments
on
motion
and
therefore
we
simply
are
making
clear
of
writing
down
in
the
form
of
statutes
of
what
was
the
law
in
district.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
i
assume
that
the
reference
is
to
unnecessary
litigation
of
what
the
parameters
of
the
remedy
were,
what
the
proper
procedures
were,
whether
one
had
to
institute
an
independence
civil
suit
and
serve
process
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
and
they
wanted
to
adopt
to
make
it
clear
that
the
procedure
here
is
the
federal
procedure
of
simply
filing
a
motion
within
the
context.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
absolutely
not
your
honor.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
well,
i
think
the
question
is
what
procedure
you
must
exercise.
the
question
is
under
francisco
v.
gathright.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
let
me
say
that
in
this
case
it
was
done
and
so
my
position
would
be
that
one
does
not,
and
if
the
local
courts
have
had
one
fair
opportunity
to
decide
these
questions
citing
francisco
and
gathright
then
that
is
all
what
is
required
for
exhaustion,
but
in
mr.
pressley’s
case
he
did
file
such
a
motion
in
the
local
courts
and
these
issues
were
thoroughly
heard.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
absolutely
and
clearly.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
well,
i
think
what
it
means
is
that
the
issues
must
be
presented
to
the
local
courts,
first
before
he
had
the
right
to
go
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
clearly
not
a
trial,
but
if
there
were
thoroughly
issued
on
aired
on
appeal
your
honor.
you
have
to
raise
them
on.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
no
question.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
no
question
your
honor.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
well,
as
i
understand
your
honor
every
state
--
well
the
question
of
whether
of
not
a
state
must
constitutionally
provide
that
some
form
of
post-conviction
attack,
i
think
has
never
been
squarely
decided
by
this
court.
it
was
before
this
court
in
case
v.
nebraska
and
while
the
case
was
pending
in
this
court
nebraska
passed
the
statute.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
well,
that
maybe
your
honor,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
clearly
congress
can
provide
an
additional
procedure
for
people
under
district
of
columbia.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
in
the
context
of
a
restatement
of
the
law
that
stood
in
the
district
of
columbia?
yes,
your
honor,
that’s
my
position.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
your
honor
i
know
of
no
case
that
discusses
the
exhaustion
issue
but
i
certainly
--
that
is
my
impression
that
that
was
the
procedure
that
one
is
based
on.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
i
do
not
even
come
up
very
often,
because
normally
people
try
to
get
to
the
article
iii
courts
by
certiorari
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
this
whole
procedure,
which
is
going
here
so
exhaustion.
i
don’t
think
it
would
arise
as
a
problem
very
often
that
kind,
so
i
know
of
no
case
that
talks
about.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
well,
i
think
that
if
one
can
trace
out
the
intellectual
history
of
the
statute
relatively
easily.
if
you
want
to
say
that
there
is
a
motion
in
the
local
courts
and
it’s
a
simple
modern
post-conviction
motion
where
do
you
look?
you
look
to
the
federal
statute,
which
sets
up
such
a
motion
in
the
federal
courts
and
if
you
apply
that
language
without
looking
at
it
terribly,
carefully.
the
last
paragraph
may
have
an
effect
that
you
don’t
intend
your
purpose
as
congress
said
it
was,
was
simply
to
set
up
such
a
procedure
in
the
local
courts.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
there
were
a
local
article
i
courts
here
in
--
mr.
mark
w.
foster
no,
it
was
in
the
court
of
general
sessions,
the
police
court.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
yes,
but
there
were
a
non-article
iii
courts
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
that
sat
and
people
convicted
in
those
local
non-article
iii
courts
once
they
had
presumably
litigated
their
issues
in
the
local
courts
could
then
go
to
federal
district
court,
and
file
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
have
their
federal
constitutional
and
questions
heard
in
article
iii
court.
so
to
the
extent
that
this
statute
is
a
restatement
of
a
law
that
stood
in
the
district
of
columbia
it
would
be
a
statement
of
those
principles.
your
honor,
the
solicitor
general
has
argued
that
congress
was
trying
when
it
passed
the
court
reorganization
act
to
get
the
federal
courts
out
of
the
business
of
local
law
enforcement.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
proposition.
that
is
clearly
was
designed
so
far
as
trials
were
concerned
on
local
charges
on
the
statute
that
apply
only
in
the
district
of
columbia.
however,
the
solicitor
general
then
seeks
to
bootstrap
that
argument
into
an
argument
that
congress
also
wish
to
remove
post-conviction
attack
entirely
from
the
federal
district
court
here.
there
is
no
statement,
and
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
no
implication
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
went
that
further
step.
it
is
very
nice
to
argue
that
maybe
in
some
philosophical
way
implied
but
i
would
argue
to
the
contrary
it’s
not
implied
to
move
trials
to
a
new
court
system
is
one
thing
but
to
move
the
form
where
once
federal
constitutional
rights
are
heard
is
quite
another
thing.
there
is
nothing
local
about
the
issue
that
mr.
pressley
seeks
to
raise.
there
is
nothing
local
about
one’s
right
to
have
a
reasonably
confident
attorney
is
just
want
a
trial
that
is
a
federal
constitutional
right
and
a
right
which
applies
nationwide.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
no
your
honor
i
don’t
think
here
we
have
argued
or
need
to
argue
that
there
is
anything
less
legitimate
as
the
solicitor
general
characterized
it
about
the
superior
court.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
it
is
different;
it
is
not
the
same
as
a
court
where
the
judge
of
that
court
is
first
allegiance
is
to
the
united
states
of
constitution
and
his
judgment
is
unimpaired
is
protected
by
the
fact
that
his
salary
and
his
tenure
in
office
are
protected
by
the
constitution.
there
is
a
difference
between
that
and
a
judge
who
was
appointed
for
a
15-year-term
who
maybe
removed
at
the
direction
of
a
legislative
body,
which
sits
under
the
very
vaguest
kind
of
guidelines
whose
salary
can
be
adjusted
upwards
or
downwards
by
the
congress
and
who
at
the
end
of
the
15
years
is
subject
to
reevaluation
upon
no
standards
at
all,
this
is
a
difference.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
the
solicitor
general
said
i
would
abandon
and
i
do
not
accept
that.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
but
i
think
it
is
clearly
to
be
emphasized
your
honor.
it
is
in
a
footnote
at
this
time
and
i
suppose
that
implies
the
emphasis,
but
i
think
--
mr.
mark
w.
foster
well,
i
think
the
reason
that
it
is
there,
in
fact,
i
know
the
reason
that
it
is
there
is
because
it
arises
in
the
context
--
i
am
not
arguing
to
this
court
demerits
of
the
equal
protection
question
or
the
suspension
clause
question.
all
i
am
saying
to
this
court
is
should
this
court
decide
in
the
context
of
this
statute,
federal,
constitutional
questions
which
are
wide
open
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned.
if
this
is
the
case
which
precipitates
by
force
this
court
into
an
area
of
constitutional
law
whether
our
very
few
guideposts
of
any
kind
whatsoever.
an
equal
protection
argument
is
simply
another
example.
there
is
a
rolling
line
of
cases
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
talks
about
this
doctrine,
never
been
before
this
court,
this
court
has
denied
certiorari
several
times
and
yet
this
court
will
have
to
decide
that
question.
that’s
why
it
is
in
the
form
that
it
is
not
because
i
intend
to
abandon
this
your
honor.
now,
the
government
--
mr.
mark
w.
foster
i
take
respectful
issue
with
the
solicitor
general
because
in
fact
i
think
palmore
is
the
case
on
our
side.
i
think
palmore
if
to
the
extent
that
he
decides
this
question
tends
to
support
our
point
of
view
asked
in
the
court
of
appeals.
what
this
court
said
in
palmore
was
that
in
the
context
of
the
court
reorganization
act
which
created
two
parallel
court
systems
in
the
district
of
columbia,
it
is
constitutional
to
try
people
in
the
article
i
court,
and
there
were
many
persons
for
that;
the
court’s
marshal,
the
territorial
courts,
the
indian
tribal
courts
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
it
is
quite
different
to
say
that
for
the
purposes
of
post-conviction
attack
will
be
confined
to
one
of
those
two
courts.
in
fact
the
palmore
opinion
is
a
pain
to
point
out.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
no
question.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
yes,
it
is
decided
well
your
honor
that
in
article
i
court
is
constitutionally
confident
to
try
and
convict
someone
on
the
felony
created
by
the
united
states.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
i
say
it
is
not
the
same
thing
for
the
purposes
of
the
suspension
clause
as
an
article
iii
courts.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
because
the
gist
of
an
article
iii
court
what
distinguishes
an
article
iii
court
from
all
other
courts
that
is
state
courts,
military
courts,
whatever,
on
the
salary
and
tenure
protections.
two
protections
that
throughout
our
history
have
been
fought
to
be
absolutely
critical
to
the
quality
of
the
highest
federal
courts.
now
the
government
wants
to
say
--
mr.
mark
w.
foster
i
meant
only
if
there
are
some
federal
courts
of
limited
jurisdiction
like
the
military
courts
marshal
to
which
it
would
not
apply,
but
the
set
piece
under
article
iii
of
the
constitution
would
federal
--
mr.
mark
w.
foster
to
me
the
courts
of
massachusetts
are
non-article
iii
courts
and
therefore
the
analysis
is
the
same.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
certainly
and
i
suppose
the
people
of
massachusetts
and
their
wisdom
might
have
amended
their
constitution
and
removed
those
provisions,
but
so
long
as
the
presumption
in
our
federal
constitution
is
that
these
question
ought
to
be
presented
to
federal
article
iii
judges.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
no
question,
but
they
have
not
done
and
what
i
am
saying
is
in
the
context
of
this
case
that
arises
in
this
court.
what
the
lynchpin
of
the
organization
the
way
the
constitution
was
put
together
and
still
stands
is
the
idea
that
federal
judges
were
going
to
be
these
judges
who
had
no
local
bias,
no
local
--
at
least
they
were
protected
from
the
passions
of
the
moment
and
political
vogue
by
the
salary
and
tenure
protections.
that
makes
them
different
in
my
view
from
any
of
the
judge
who
does
not
have
those
protections,
and
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
that
any
substitute
for
federal
habeas
corpus
must
be
exactly
commensurate.
now,
i
am
not
here
to
say
what
is
more
legitimate
or
less
legitimate,
better
or
worse,
i
am
simply
here
to
say
that
it
is
not
exactly
commensurate
to
say
that
the
judge
who
will
hear
your
claims
is
different
in
quality.
those
qualities
have
been
thought
to
be
very
important.
in
fact
this
court
in
palmore
said,
we
do
not
deemphasize
the
importance
of
the
distinction
between
article
i
and
article
iii.
it’s
just
that
article
iii
is
not
required
here
and
my
argument
let
me
be
perfectly
clear
on
this
federal
constitutional
point.
my
argument
is
not
that
article
iii
requires
that
these
federal
constitutional
questions
be
heard
in
article
iii
courts;
it
is
that
the
suspension
clause
requires
that
these
questions
to
be
heard
--
mr.
mark
w.
foster
well,
i
suppose
that
this
court
can
say
that
is
what
the
last
clause
means
and
that
the
article
i
court
is
ineffective,
and
therefore
you
come
out
at
the
same
point
at
the
end
of
the
argument.
i
think
that
that
argument
suffers
from
the
fact
that
those
words
have
been
interpreted
many
times
by
this
court
in
the
2255
context
and
they
have
been
held
not
to
mean
that
in
the
particular
form.
for
instance,
in
the
2255
context
if
you
are
in
a
circuit
that
doesn’t
hold
your
way.
you
cannot
say
well
my
remedy
is
unaffected
because
if
i
can
go
back
to
my
home
circuit
they
give
me
a
different
result,
and
so
though
i
suppose
it
is
open
on
grammar
grounds
to
arrive
at
that
result.
i
am
not
anxious
to
press
the
argument.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
no,
your
honor
absolutely
not.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
they
required
it
after
the
civil
war
and
the
act
passed
in
1867
and
in
fact
the
federal
courts
held
that
there
was
no
right
before
them
but
i
am
not
saying
--
mr.
mark
w.
foster
well,
i
think
--
let
me
backup
a
little
bit,
because
i
think
i
have
not
yet
had
an
opportunity
to
say
that
as
i
do
not
say
that
mr.
pressley,
the
suspension
clause
requires
an
article
iii
judgment
mr.
pressley
because
he
is
like
a
state
prisoner.
that’s
not
my
argument.
my
argument
is
that
2241
is
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
district
courts
to
grant
writ
of
habeas
corpus
for
people
who
are
confined
by
the
authority
of
the
united
states,
and
that
power
has
existed
uninterrupted
from
the
federal
judiciary
act
of
1789.
in
fact,
those
words
have
stood
unaltered
over
200
years
of
federal
constitutional
history,
and
i
think
there
is
something
--
i
am
very
frank
to
say
to
this
court
that
the
question
presented
by
this
case,
the
federal
constitutional
question
presented
by
this
case
has
never
been
decided
by
this
court.
that
is
to
say
that
whether
or
not
the
suspension
clause
requires
an
article
iii
court.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor
because
you
mean
as
the
state
prisons?
mr.
mark
w.
foster
but
i
am
not
arguing
by
analogy
to
state
prisoners.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
on
account
conviction?
mr.
mark
w.
foster
yes,
your
honor,
there
are
many,
many
cases.
there
are
cases
that
books
are
replete
with
cases
of
people
between
1789
and
the
civil
war
being
held
by
power
of
the
united
states
now.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
yes,
your
honor,
there
are
i
think
many
such
cases
especially
as
the
article
i
courts,
the
military
courts
for
instance
where
frequently
there
are
judgments
who
were
reversed
upon
review
and
there
are
of
course
analogies
because
they
are
article
i
courts
like
the
superior
court
in
the
district
of
columbia.
that
right
i
think
has
existed
from
1789
without
any
interruption.
the
government
has
not
cited
case
or
suggestion.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
that
is
correct
your
honor
but
they
are
created
under
the
same
constitutional
power
that
congress
exercised.
well,
there
are
other
examples
of
course
the
special
courts
that
have
been
set
up
through
our
history
of
article
i
courts
and
in
every
case
where
an
article
i
court
has
or
any
non-article
iii
authority
of
united
states
has
the
power
to
lock
people
up.
this
court
and
the
other
federal
courts
have
always
found
without
exception
that
the
writ
of
federal
habeas
corpus
would
reach
those
people
everyone,
and
that
is
of
course
one
of
the
major
differences
between
this
case
and
palmore
because
this
court
in
palmore
was
faced
with
many
examples
of
people
who
could
be
tried
and
convicted
in
non-article
iii
courts.
but
in
this
case
it
is
not
faced
with
an
example
of
anyone
who
could
be
confined
by
the
power
of
the
united
states
and
could
not
ultimately
go
after
exhaustion
to
a
federal
article
iii
court
for
resolution
of
his
federal
constitutional
plans.
there
is
no
such
case.
and
many
times
in
our
history,
in
our
legislative
history
congress
has
passed
statutes,
which
would
appear
to
reach
the
result
and
i
once
again
force
to
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general
and
gusik
case.
this
court
was
faced
by
a
statute
which
says
that
judgments
of
court’s
marshall
shall
be
final
binding
and
conclusive
on
all
courts
of
united
states.
how
much
clear
could
it
be.
this
court
said
unanimously
that
language
means
that
you
must
exhaust
your
remedies
in
the
article
i
courts
before
you
present
your
question
to
the
federal
article
iii
courts.
it
is
the
same
question
that
is
presented
in
this
case.
does
a
statute
--
is
this
a
finality
statute
or
exhaustion
statute
or
it
is
the
other
side
of
the
same
coin,
and
i
would
claim
that
the
same
considerations,
which
move
the
court
to
say
if
we
decide
otherwise
that
this
is
not
a
finality
statute
in
gusik.
it
is
going
to
launch
us
into
an
area
of
constitution
that
we
have
not
yet
adjudicated
and
is
not
necessary
on
the
statute
though
it
was
reasonably
clear.
it
is
no
way
to
argue
that
final
binding
conclusive
could
be
anymore
clear.
nonetheless
this
court
compelled
to
avoid
the
issue
where
it
was
fairly
possible
to
do
some,
and
that
is
my
argument
to
the
court
here
today
on
this
statute.
now,
the
government
withdraws
much
solace
from
the
fact
that
the
words
not
bars
from
2255,
and
yet
it
must
be
clear
that
they
have
a
different
purpose.
2255
was
an
effective
traffic
rule;
it
said,
we
don’t
want
to
--
we
are
going
to
direct
this
litigation,
we
are
going
to
spread
it
out
overall
the
circuits,
because
it
is
unfairly
lumped
up
in
kansas
and
in
albatross
where
the
big
federal
prisons
were.
that
problem
does
not
exist
in
the
district
of
columbia.
there
is
no
traffic
problem
here.
there
is
one
court,
one
jurisdiction.
therefore,
the
words
of
2255
could
not
have
been
barred
to
the
same
purpose;
they
were
barred
from
some
other
purpose
and
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
way,
the
place
to
look
for
what
that
purpose
would
have
been
is
to
the
statute,
the
federal
statute
which
regulates
these
relations
in
the
state
federal
analogy.
now,
i
am
not
arguing
that
congress
created
the
51st
state
when
it
reorganized
the
courts
in
the
district
of
columbia.
i
am
simply
saying
that
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
is
replete
with
references
to
the
fact
that
congress
wanted
the
district
of
columbia
to
be
treated
like
a
state.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
court’s
question.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
well,
it
is
perfectly
clear--
mr.
mark
w.
foster
well,
no
matter
what
label
is
attached
there
is
only
one
sovereignty
here
in
the
district
of
columbia,
and
that
is
the
united
states
of
america,
whether
the
united
states
of
america
act
in
its
--
mr.
mark
w.
foster
no
that
is
why
i
was
careful
to
say
that
i
am
not
arguing
that
they
created
a
51st
state.
they
said
that
for
the
purpose
of
how
this
will
work
out,
it
will
work
out
like
the
states
do
as
if
this
were
a
state
not
that
it
is
the
same
and
therefore
i
would
suggest
that
the
place
to
look
for
congress’s
purpose
in
picking
up
this
language
from
2255
is
to
the
statute
we
have
regulated
these
relations
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government
and
that
statute
is
2254
and
what
2254
requires
in
this
regard
is
exhaustion
of
non-article
iii
remedies,
state
remedies
in
that
case,
before
you
come
into
federal
court
for
resolution
of
your
federal
constitutional
question.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
i
certainly
think
your
honor,
i
certainly
agree
with
the
implication.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
i
understand
that
your
honor.
i
certainly
think
and
i
cannot
because
this
is
a
new
act
there
is
not
enough
experience
for
me
to
cite
of
this
court
a
case,
which
would
stand
for
that
proposition.
the
case
in
which
the
superior
court
on
110
(g)
has
said
we
are
not
free
to
consider
this
question,
because
it
is
already
been
decided
on
direct
--
mr.
mark
w.
foster
exactly
and
their
war
hands
are
therefore
tied.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
and
under
favor
i
would
assume
that
the
spirit
of
the
review
is
to
take
a
fresh
look
at
it
from
the
perspective
of
the
judge
who
is
primary
allegiance
is
to
the
federal
constitution
with
all
the
protections
we
have
talked
about
and
to
make
a
new
determination
on
that
and
that
is
what
i
think
is
protected
by
the
ultimate
ride
of
people
confined
by
the
authority
of
the
united
states
to
go
to
a
federal
article
iii
court
for
ultimate
resolution.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
because
they
are
institutionally
located
differently
than
the
federal
article
iii.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
i
hope
it
is
there
because
i
certainly
indented
it
to
be
there.
they
are
institutionally
set
and
situated
differently
vis-à-vis
the
constitution
on
the
case
before
them
then
is
in
the
superior
court,
the
trial
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
when
we
have
automatic
appeal
of
right
and
appointed
counsel
for
all
people
and
there
are
direct
appeals
in
most
of
the
criminal
cases
here
and
their
situation
would
be
very
different
vis-à-vis
the
case
that
have
already
been
decided
by
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
i
think
your
honor
he
is
in
a
different
situation
under
this
court’s
decisions
dealing
with
post-conviction
attack
than
the
superior
court
judgment
and
that
is
this
court
has
emphasized
that
a
federal
judge
in
reviewing
a
federal
constitutional
question
on
post-conviction
attack
has
a
different
job
before
him.
the
question
is
not
guilt
or
innocence,
but
the
preservation
of
certain
federal
constitutional
values
that
are
paramount
and
the
focus
shifts
slightly.
now,
i
do
not
deny
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
the
opinion
of
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
your
example
is
a
great
way,
but
as
i
understand
that
the
situation
of
a
judge
facing
that
question
he
is
bound
to
determine
it
again.
mr.
mark
w.
foster
yes
your
honor
no
question
with
that.
i
am
just
saying
when
you
have,
when
a
judge
has
before
him
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
his
focus
is
slightly
different
than
it
would
be
if
you
were
trying
the
things,
thank
you.
