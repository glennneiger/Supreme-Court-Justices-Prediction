mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
that
court
sitting
en
banc
and
held
with
one
dissent
of
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
has
jurisdiction
to
entertain
respondent
pressley’s
application
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
seeking
post
conviction
relief.
the
conviction
from
which
he
seeks
relief
occurred
in
the
superior
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
we
contend
that
the
district
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
entertain
such
applications.
the
issue
was
obviously
important
one
to
the
objectives
congress
sought
to
attain
in
the
1970
reorganization
of
the
court
system
in
the
district
of
columbia.
major
part
of
that
before
in
reorganization
was
intended
to
relieve
the
district
court
system
of
local
criminal
law
enforcement.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
we
think
to
have
reversed
brings
the
district
court
back
in
part
into
local
criminal
law
matters.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
first,
the
meaning
and
second,
the
constitutionality
of
section
110
(g)
of
title
iii
of
the
district
of
columbia
code.
meaning
is
rather
clear
in
the
section
110
(g)
deprives
the
district
court
jurisdiction
over
applications
for
habeas
corpus
by
those
who
have
been
convicted
in
the
superior
court.
the
court
of
appeals
held
to
the
contrary
that
110
(g)
is
a
mere
exhaustion
of
remedies
provision
so
that
prisoners
must
seek
relief
initially
in
the
superior
court
but
may
then.
if
that
relief
is
denied,
proceed
into
the
district
court
with
the
same
application,
knowing
construing
the
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
stated,
indeed
insisted,
that
its
interpretation
was
heavily
influenced
by
its
desire
to
avoid
constitutional
issues
which
is
regard
to
this
trouble.
always
there
are
two
propositions:
the
first
is
the
section
110
(g)
is
so
clear
and
so
unambiguous
in
denying
jurisdiction.
the
federal
district
courts
in
a
case
such
as
this
one
that
no
amount
of
constitutional
concern
can
justify
interpreting
the
statute
as
a
mere
exhaustion
of
remedies
provision.
it
is
clear
what
congress
has
done
and
there
is
no
legitimate
way
to
avoid
constitutional
issues
if
constitutional
issues
there
be.
my
second
point
therefore
is
that
110
(g)
of
the
district
code
passes
the
relevant
constitutional
tests
and
does
so
relevantly
easily.
i
would
like
to
turn
first
to
the
statutory
question.
110,
as
a
general
manner,
gives
superior
court
the
power
to
entertain
collateral
tax
upon
its
own
senses,
and
that
power
is
just
as
broad
in
scope
and
of
the
same
nature
as
a
collateral
attack
would
be
in
the
federal
district
court
under
2255,
for
example.
now,
the
relevant
language
to
this
case
which
is
in
110
(g)
is
this:
“an
application
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
shall
not
be
entertained
by
any
federal
court
if
it
appears
that
the
applicant
has
failed
to
make
a
motion
for
relief
under
this
section
or
that
the
superior
court
has
denied
him
relief.”
i
can
think
of
no
way
that
language
could
be
made
clear.
no
federal
court
may
entertain
the
superior
court,
convict’s
habeas
corpus
petition
if
the
convict
has
not
made
a
motion
in
the
superior
court
or
if
he
has
done
so
and
lost.
there
are
two
clauses.
the
first
one
is
an
exhaustion
of
remedies
provision.
the
second
one
is
clearly
a
denial
of
jurisdiction
provision
and
to
read
second
clause
as
a
mere
exhaustion
of
remedies
provision
is
to
read
it
out
with
the
statute
which
i
submit
is
not
interpretation,
it
is
revealed.
this
is
not
a
case
like
gusik
v.
schilder,
where
the
court
through
it
would
have
required
a
strain
to
read
the
finality
language
as
other
than
the
exhaustion
of
remedies
provision
and
if
refused
to
strain
the
language
in
order
to
reach
a
constitutional
issue.
i
think
this
can
be
made
clear
if
you
ask
yourself,
what
would
congress
do?
if
it
meant
this
to
be
a
denial
of
jurisdiction,
what
would
it
do
after
the
court
of
appeals’
decision
in
order
to
make
that
fact
clear.
i
cannot
think
of
anything,
that
will
make
it
clear
unless
it
italicize
that
language
in
the
code,
and
then
said,
we
really
mean
the
italicized
language.
it
is
done
as
much
as
it
can
to
make
this
point.
now,
there
is
much
argument
about
the
legislative
history
in
this
case.
the
truth
is
there
is
very
little
legislative
history
in
this
case;
it
is
very
enlightened.
but,
the
court
of
appeals
to
some
extent
responded,
used
an
argument
which
is
a
wide
variety
of
arguments
none
of
which
from
the
legislative
history
really
go
to
overturn
the
language
in
the
text,
but
we
do
know
two
things.
we
do
know
that
congress
intended
to
remove
local
matters
from
the
federal
district
courts.
we
know
that
the
statute
does
that
as
we
read
it,
and
that
supports
it,
but
more
importantly
is
the
fact
that
section
110
(g)
is
model.
the
congress
said,
it
was
using
as
a
model
28
u.s.c.
2255
and
indeed
the
language
is
almost
identical.
we
know
that
2255
the
post
conviction
relief
statute
is
not
an
exhaustion
of
remedy
statute,
it
is
a
jurisdictional
statute.
it
says
that
you
must
go
back
to
the
sentencing
court
to
get
your
post
conviction
relief,
you
may
go
and
replace
else
and
that
tends
to
remove
the
jurisdiction
from
all
other
courts,
but
the
sentencing
court.
110
(g)
copies
that
language
and
removes
jurisdiction
from
any
court
other
than
the
sentencing
court,
which
in
this
case
is
the
superior
court.
i
suppose
if
there
is
any
difference
between
the
two
and
there
is,
it
is
that
110
(g)
is
even
clear,
because
whereas
2255
simply
says
that
the
motion
shall
not
be
entertained,
language
was
added
to
110
(g)
in
the
district
court
and
say
the
motion
shall
not
be
entertained
by
the
superior
court
or
by
any
federal
or
state
court
which
(inaudible).
now,
against
all
of
this
the
court
of
appeals
replaces
reliance
one,
two
points,
the
first
one
is
that
the
local
court
system
of
district
of
columbia,
the
article
i
court
system
was
intended
to
be
in
many
respects
analogous
to
a
state
court
system,
and
that
is
quite
true,
but
an
analogy
is
by
no
means
of
identity.
this
system
differs
in
many
respects,
and
one
of
them
is
the
respect,
which
is
plainly
before
us
here.
the
second
part
of
reliance
was
the
congress
could
not
have
meant
what
it
plainly
said
because
that
would
have
provoked
heated
constitutional
debate,
and
there
was
none.
the
answer
to
that
is
that
there
was
no
constitutional
excitement,
because
congress
had
done
the
same
thing
20
years
before,
and
there
had
been
no
constitutional
excitement
about
that
and
it
probably
could
completely
do
the
same
thing
again.
under
2255
collateral
attacks,
upon
sentences
imposed
by
territorial
courts
organized
in
the
article
iv
of
the
constitution,
and
non
article
iii
court
must
be
brought
exclusively
by
motion
in
those
courts,
which
is
parallel
to
situation
here.
no
court
has
suggested
that
the
unconstitutional
will
send
those
is
unconstitutional
to
require
a
person
convicted
in
the
territorial
court
to
go
back
for
his
post-conviction
relief
under
2255
to
that
sentencing
court.
so
there
was
no
occasion
for
congress
to
think
that
there
was
anything
unique
or
exciting
or
troublesome
about
what
it
was
doing
in
the
statute.
i
think
the
statutory
argument
is
clear,
so
i
turn
to
the
constitutional
argument.
now,
the
constitutional
objection
really
is
that
although
respondent
maybe
constitutionally
convicted
and
sentenced
in
an
article
i
court
created
for
the
district
court
of
columbia.
he
may
not
be
required
to
seek
his
post-conviction
relief
in
that
same
court.
i
think
this
court’s
decision
in
united
states
against
palmore
affectively
disposes
of
that
contention
is
implausible
that
a
person
who
can
be
tried
initially,
constitutionally
in
such
a
court
may
not
have
his
post-conviction
relief
motion
determined
by
such
a
court.
i
think
that
is
not
with
the
case,
but
the
argument
is
dressed
up
here
by
a
statement
that
to
require
a
convict
to
go
back
to
the
superior
court
is
to
spend
the
privilege
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
which
contravenes
article
i,
section
9,
clause
2
of
the
constitution
and
also
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
contravenes
the
protection
concept
of
the
due
process
clause.
neither
of
those
claims
i
think
is
plausible
after
palmore
and
i
will
say
a
few
words.
the
suggestion
that
110
(g)
violates
the
suspension
clause
is
dispose
quite
quickly
i
think.
it
is
our
position
expressed
in
our
brief
that
history
shows
that
the
guarantee
of
the
suspension
clause
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
any
post-conviction
applications
for
habeas
corpus.
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
drafted
and
adopted,
the
common
law
rule
was
that
the
post-conviction
application
for
habeas
corpus
could
be
defeated
by
showing
that
there
was
a
judgment
in
conviction
by
a
criminal
court
of
general
jurisdiction,
and
that
is
our
position
so
the
congress
would
be
free
to
wish
to
suspend
the
writ
entirely,
but
we
don’t
rest
upon
that.
our
main
point,
we
may
not
reach
that
historical
point
because
our
main
point
is
clear
that
what
was
done
here
was
in
no
sense
a
suspension
of
the
privilege
of
the
writ.
it’s
exactly
the
motion
under
110
(g)
or
under
110
is
exactly
commensurate
with
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
as
is
exactly
commensurate
with
2255,
so
there
is
no
suspension
of
the
writ
in
this
case.
the
nature
of
the
relief
is
the
same.
the
grounds
upon
which
it
can
be
cited
are
the
same,
the
procedure
is
the
same,
and
the
only
difference
that
is
pointed
to
is
that
the
court
considered
the
motion
is
to
create
under
article
i
rather
than
the
article
iii
because
i
say
i
think
palmore
answers
that
contention,
because
if
article
i
court
given
the
special
powers
of
congress
or
the
district
of
columbia
is
capable
of
providing
a
legitimate
constitutional
trial,
and
i
think
is
capable
of
providing
a
legitimate
constitutional
post-conviction
review.
besides,
it
is
clear
that
we
are
dealing
that
the
purpose
of
the
suspension
clause
was
to
prevent
the
effective
denial
of
the
writ
altogether
and
was
not
to
regulate
--
prohibit
congress
from
regulating
the
details,
its
procedural
details.
otherwise,
if
that
is
not
true
we
are
going
to
get
in
the
questions
about
whether
the
new
rules
which
allow
the
dismissal
of
a
motion
one
of
the
latest
filing
prejudices
the
government
was
that
is
a
suspension
or
the
privilege
of
the
writ
or
as
the
rules
were
originally
promulgated,
i
understand
that
they
required,
is
that
an
application
under
2255(b)
sworn
to
during
oath.
let
us
suppose
we
have
an
argument
about
whether
that
is
a
suspension
of
the
writ.
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
those
procedural
details
are
not
--
would
beyond
congress’s
power
by
this
suspension
clause,
and
certainly
here
when
you
have
federal
judges
appointed
by
the
president,
confirmed
by
the
senate,
15-year
terms
and
with
a
post-conviction
procedure,
which
is
specified
by
the
congress
and
is
as
broad
as
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
impossible
to
say
that
there
is
any
suspension
of
the
writ.
the
court
of
appeals
had
attained
some
speculations
about
the
equal
protection
concept,
which
respondent
has
not
pressed
here
particularly,
but
i
think
i
should
mention
him
any
of
them
because
they
are
in
the
opinion
below.
the
theory
apparently
is
that
equal
protection
maybe
in
question,
because
under
28
u.s.c.
2254,
a
person
convicted
in
the
state
court
may
petition
an
article
iii
court
for
post-conviction
collateral
attack.
while
a
superior
court
found
that
the
district
of
columbia
must
petition
in
article
i
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
nothing
more
than
the
suspension
clause
argument
all
over
again,
ends
up
once
more
in
for
that
reason
it’s
answered
by
the
palmore
decision.
the
argument
whether
it
is
a
suspension
clause
or
whether
it
is
placed
in
the
equal
protection
context
is
always
contains
the
hidden
assumption
that
the
superior
court
is
less
legitimate
in
some
way
than
an
article
iii
court
is,
and
if
that
assumption
is
rejected
as
it
was
in
palmore
then
i
think
there
is
no
equal
protection
issue
here
just
as
there
is
no
suspension
clause
issue
here,
and
i
think
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter
but
i
suppose
there
are
two
other
or
few
other
points
that
should
be
mentioned.
the
equal
protection
concept
obviously
does
not
encompass
the
right
to
deprive
the
particular
tribunal.
if
the
remedies
available
are
equal
then
i
think
there
is
no
problem.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
that
is
the
argument
as
i
understand,
but
i
think
the
argument
necessarily
rest
upon
the
premise
that
even
in
the
district
of
columbia
where
the
congress
has
special
powers
under
section
1.
there
is
something
less
legitimate
about
in
article
i
court
than
there
is
--
less
legitimate
article
i
court
than
an
article
iii
court
because
if
that
assumption
is
not
present
and
there
is
really
no
denial
of
equal
protection.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
essence
that
federal
defendant
is
that
we
made
it
to
the
sentencing
court.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true
in
that
sense
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true,
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
decision
were
upheld
and
in
that
sense
mr.
justice
white,
prisoners
here
would
be
better
off
and
prisoners
under
2255
if
one
consider
that
being
better
off,
because
they
would
get
both
the
local
system
and
a
federal
system.
so
i
suppose
you
have
---
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
the
conclusion
we
are
coming
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
that
no
matter
which
way
one
goes
if
one
adopts
a
rather
artificial
view
of
this
matter
there
will
be
denial
of
equal
protection,
because
if
the
court
of
appeals
--
2254
prisoners
go
from
state
system
to
a
federal
system,
and
therefore
is
sent
by
the
court
of
appeals.
prisoners
here
should
go
from
the
article
i
system
to
the
federal
article
iii
system.
but
mr.
white
points
out
that
that
would
--
if
that
is
an
advantage,
which
one
is
entitled
to
examine
under
equal
protection
concept,
which
i
deny.
mr.
justice
white
points
out
that
that
would
then
create
a
disparity,
which
one
would
have
to
examine,
because
persons
who
were
entitled
to
go
from
article
i
court
to
an
article
iii
court
would
be
better
off
in
some
sense
had
two
systems.
better
off
than
those
proceeding
under
2255,
who
were
always
in
federal
court
and
go
right
back
to
the
sentencing
court
for
their
post-conviction
relief.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
that
is
true
i
think
palmore
says
that
an
article
i
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
given
the
powers
that
the
congress
has
them
in
the
district
and
given
away
it
has
established
these
course
is
not
inferior.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
suppose
mr.
chief
justice
you
see
that
here
i
think
--
the
state
analogy
there
is,
i
think
there
is
clear
difference
between
this
and
the
states
that
is
congress
has
created
this
court
system
with
many
safeguards
that
some
state
systems
do
not
have
and
congress
has
prescribed
a
careful
set
of
post-conviction
remedies
that
many
states
do
not
have.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
don’t
know
offhand
that
that
would
of
itself
make
a
difference,
but
it
should
be
noted
of
course
that
110
(g)
like
2255
provides
that
if
the
federal
court
regards
the
procedures
as
inadequate,
ineffective
that
it
may
entertain
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
so
that
should
conditions
change
with
respect
to
the
district
of
columbia
courts.
the
statute
by
its
terms
allows
access
to
the
article
iii
courts.
i
do
not
know
if
that
is
a
sufficient
answer
to
the
question
you
put
to
me,
but
i
am
basically
saying
if
we
are
required
to
assume
that
there
is
a
difference
with
constitutional
significance
or
as
rises
to
a
level
of
constitutional
notice
between
the
article
iii
courts
in
the
rest
of
the
country
and
the
article
i
courts
in
the
district
of
columbia.
then
i
think
there
is
a
very
rational
reason
why
congress
has
treated
them
someone
differently
and
that
rational
reason
is
that
congress
has
no
control
over
the
state
court
systems
or
their
post-conviction
remedies.
it
does
have
that
control
of
the
article
i
courts
here
and
over
the
remedies,
and
they
have
crafted
a
very
careful
and
fair
system
with
all
of
the
rights
of
post-conviction
review
that
any
federal
prisoner
anywhere.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
i’ll
like
to
answer
that,
but
let
me
make
clear
that
i
don’t
think
this
is
necessarily
involved
with
the
decision
of
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
have
speculated
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
let
me
go
into
that
mr.
justice
stevens
and
see
if
i
understand
the
problem.
i
have
speculated,
this
is
speculation
and
i
suppose
one
should
not
engage
in
that
but
i
will.
i
don’t
think
it
is
directly
well
appear
that
congress
might
be
able
constitutionally
to
say
that
those
days
which
adopt
a
post-conviction
relief
statute
which
is
like
2255
in
all
of
those
procedures
and
mechanisms
and
reset
another
criteria
of
that
judicial
system
shall
be
freed
of
2255
and
the
post-conviction
relief
will
be
in
those
courts
but
otherwise
you
have
access
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
am
sorry,
quite
right.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
if
it
has
to
be
adequate,
and
i
think
that
is
true
but
that
would
be
an
example
of
--
that’s
is
why
i
say,
i
think
congress
constitutionally
in
that
case
turnover
the
post-conviction
relief
to
a
non
article
iii
court
where
it
can
prescribe
the
adequate
procedures
and
that
is
precisely
what
is
done
here.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
quite
right
mr.
justice
stevens,
even
in
fact
that
could
not
be
regarded
as
the
suspension
of
the
writ,
because
congress
is
free
not
the
head
of
any
lower
federal
courts,
no
district
court,
no
courts
of
appeals.
we
know
that
is
from
the
constitution
from
article
iii
itself,
and
so
turning
that
as
over
the
state
courts
as
we
do
through
much
of
our
historic
federal
questions
would
not
be
a
suspension
of
the
writ
if
the
writ
is
adequate.
but
that
is
our
basic
presentation.
i
think
the
statute
cannot
be
gotten
away
from
it.
i
think
it
says,
it
is
clearly
and
words
can
ever
say
the
district
court
here
has
no
jurisdiction.
i
think
the
constitutional
arguments
are
basically
answered
by
the
palmore
with
additional
observations
i
have
made
at
the
moment,
and
for
that
reason
we
ask
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
we
reversed.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
just
the
minor
thing
mr.
chief
justice.
if
it
were
true
that
a
prisoner
had
a
right
to
go
into
a
different
court
system,
because
his
own
systems
always
decided
the
issue
when
he
has
to
go
some
place
where
the
issues
has
not
been
decided.
if
that
were
constitutional
principle
then
i
think,
i
would
follow
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
the
federal
prisoners
here
would
have
a
right
to
go
into
the
superior
court
system
and
the
federal
prisoners
around
the
country
would
find
2255
by
constitution,
and
they
would
all
have
a
right
to
go
to
the
state
court
systems.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
one
other
circuit
i
think
that
might
be,
unless
the
supreme
court
here
spoken
mr.
chief
justice
which
case
and
again
be
unconstitutional.
it
has
been
rather
clever
i
think
argument
about
the
statute.
i
think
the
constitutional
issues
must
be
addressed,
because
what
has
happened
is
repeatedly
plain
statute
that
says
this
in
words
as
plainly
as
can
be,
and
we
are
told
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
upon
us
to
prove
the
congress
really
meant
what
it
said
like
the
burden
goes
the
other
way.
now,
it
turns
out
that
mr.
clindings
the
couple
of
pages
before
the
language
that
was
quoted
said
that
the
effort
was
to
transfer
the
entire
criminal
jurisdiction
to
the
superior
court.
we
could
debate
the
ambiguities
of
the
mr.
clindings
testimony.
but,
i
think
i
would
rather
debate
for
clarity
of
the
statute.
one
other
point,
there
was
a
suggestion
that
although
congress
explicitly
said
we
are
using
2255
as
a
model
and
then
did
it.
the
appropriate
place
to
look
is
2254
which
i
think
this
argument
in
the
same
tenure
is
the
constitutional
interpretation
here
as
been,
thank
you.
