well,
it
does
not
this
there
are
little
more
to
the
equal
protection
argument
then
you
suggest
in
that
prisoners
who
are
convicted
in
any
of
the
state
forums,
which
are
presumably
legitimate
nonetheless
have
the
right
to
petitioner
federal
district
court
for
habeas
and
affect
someone
convicted
in
the
district
of
columbia
court
is
the
only
person
who
does
not
have
the
right
to
petition
to
federal
district
court
for
habeas.

that
would
be
better
off
if
you
treat
them
as
the
same
as
if
they
were
state
prisoners.
