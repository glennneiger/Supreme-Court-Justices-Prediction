we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
75-811,
swain
v.
pressley.
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice

e.
burger
but
if
the
prisoner
feels
he
is
getting
in
the
best
in
first
place,
he
isnâ€™t
concerned
about
having
that
denied
what
he
regarded
to
at
least
as
less
than
the
best
that
is
less
than
an
article
iii
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
one
thing
it
is
not
mr.
solicitor
general
to
say
what
kind
of
a
judge
you
must
have
filed
the
case
in
the
first
instance
or
perhaps
another
thing
say
what
kind
of
a
judge
must
be
given
jurisdiction
for
habeas
corpus,
is
that
would
analogize
to
the
state
situation
versus
the
federal,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
emphasized
the
15-year
tenure,
suppose
the
tenure
of
judges
in
the
district
of
columbia
was
three
years
instead
of
15
years.

e.

mr.

further?

or
another
circuit.
chief

e.

thank
you
gentleman.

case
is
submitted.
chief

thank
you,
