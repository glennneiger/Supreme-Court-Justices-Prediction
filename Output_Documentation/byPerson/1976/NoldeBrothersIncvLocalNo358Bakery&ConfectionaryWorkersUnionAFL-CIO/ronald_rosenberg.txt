mr.
ronald
rosenberg
i
live
in
washington,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
the
issues
here
are
clearly
drawn
by
the
questions
that
have
come
from
the
court.
essentially
what
we
have
is
the
proposition
advanced
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
that
it
is
extremely
detrimental
to
the
national
labor
policy
to
have
contractual
rights
vindicated
in
the
contractual
forum,
that
in
some
way,
using
the
arbitral
forum
that
this
contract
provided
violates
the
national
labor
policy.
that
argument,
of
course,
is
absurd.
it
does
not
give
full
credit
to
this
contract
between
the
parties.
it
does
not
give
full
credit
to
the
presumption
of
arbitrability
that
this
court
has
many
times
declared.
it
pays
no
attention
whatsoever
to
the
repeated
decisions
of
this
court,
most
particularly,
the
wiley
and
piano
workers
case,
your
honor,
and
wiley
is
indeed
directly
on
point.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
certainly,
your
honor.
just
for
the
moment,
if
i
may,
the
fourth
circuit
rather,
did
discuss
the
question
of
the
arbitrator’s
own
duty
upon
remand.
that
issue
is
not
before
this
court.
the
dissenter
in
the
fourth
circuit
indicated
that
there
was
a
procedural
arbitrability
question.
that
question
is
not
presented
in
the
cert
petition
or
argued
here.
the
question
here
is
exclusively
arbitrability
qua
non.
i
think
that
wiley
and
piano
workers
are
directly
in
point.
the
one
part
of
wiley
that
is
never
discussed
either
in
this
argument
or
in
the
briefs
by
the
petitioner
is
that
element
of
wiley
that
specifically
refers
to
the
question
about
the
accrual
of
rights
for
the
realization
thereafter.
in
wiley,
the
lawsuit
was
essentially
a
declaratory
judgment
brought
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
i
think
that
is
wiley,
i
think
that
is
the
steelworkers
trilogy,
i
think
that
is
piano
workers.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
here
there
is
unquestionably
a
promise
to
arbitrate.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
there
is
no
indication
whatsoever
that
it
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
all
contractual
disputes.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
from
the
very
language
of
the
arbitration
clause
and
from
the
presumption
of
arbitrability.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
the
contract
has
not
expired
in
totality,
if
rights
survive
under
that
contract.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
the
question
rather,
your
honor,
is
whether
there
was
a
right
to
severance
pay.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
if
there
is
a
right
to
severance
pay,
a
vested
right
to
severance
pay,
then
the
proper
forum
for
the
resolution
of
such
a
dispute
is
arbitration
and
that
the
court.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
there
was
unquestionably,
a
promise
to
arbitrate
in
the
broadest
marginal
(ph)
language.
my
opponent
just
characterized
its
agreement
to
arbitrate
as
admittedly
broad.
it
contains
no
exclusion.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
the
promise
has
expired
no
more
than
the
right
to
vested
severance
pay
or
vested
earned
wages.
the
hypotheticals
that
were
presented
to
my
opponent
during
his
argument
made
clear
that
there
are
obviously
rights
which
over
accrued
or
earned
right
nature
which
survived
the
normal
expiration
of
the
agreement.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
but
if
you
look
to
the
arbitration
clause,
this
arbitration
clause
does
not
remove
any
contractual
dispute
from
arbitration.
if
there
is
to
be
a
dispute
about
that
substance
of
right,
it
is
must
be
determined
by
an
arbitrator,
not
by
a
court.
otherwise,
we
would
have
a
ludicrous
situation
in
which
there
would
forum
shopping
as
between
courts
and
arbitrators
depending
upon
the
fertility
of
the
date
of
termination.
we
assert
rights
that
are
based
upon
this
contract.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
but
if
that
would
be
in
a
hypothetical
situation,
your
honor,
if
it
had
occurred
some
other
way,
the
question
still
is
as
to
whether
or
not
this
arbitration
clause
is
in
any
way
limited,
just
as
my
opponent
showed
that
it
could
have
been
eliminated.
given
the
presumption
of
arbitrability
as
announced
by
this
court
in
the
steelworkers
trilogy,
there
must
be
arbitration
unless
it
can
be
said,
and
this
is
the
court’s
language,
“with
positive
assurance
that
there
is
no
interpretation
possible
under
which
there
is
to
be
no
arbitration.”
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well,
your
honor,
there
is,
of
course
the
question
in
wiley
and
then
in
piano
workers
as
justice
white
pointed
out.
in
wiley,
the
rights
to
arbitrated
were
rights
subsequent
to
the
expiration
of
the
agreement.
justice
harlan,
for
a
unanimous
court
in
wiley,
very
specifically
dealt
with
the
rights
occurring,
i
believe
it
was
after
january
1,
1962,
which
was
the
expiration
date
of
the
contract.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
there
was
no
strike
here,
your
honor,
because
the
plant
was
closed
prior
to
any
strike.
but
such
a
strike
—
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
we
gave
notice,
but
i
think
the
facts
might
be
–
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
we
struck
at
a
time
when
we
had
no
notion
that
the
plant
was
to
be
closed.
the
strike
would
have
occurred
in
such
a
circumstance
that
would
not
have
anything
to
do
with
severance
pay.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
a
strike
for
severance
pay
would
have
been
forbidden
by
the
contract.
here,
notice
was
–
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
the
‘no
strike’
clause
was
in
return
for
a
promise
to
arbitrate
contractual
issues.
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
a
contractual
claim.
the
severance
pay
is
a
contractual
claim.
everything
stems
from
the
fact
that
our
claim
for
severance
pay
sounds
in
contract,
is
governed
by
the
contract
and
this
court’s
decision
made
clear
that
whether
there
is
such
a
claim,
then
necessarily
there
must
be
arbitration
unless,
as
your
honors
pointed
out,
there
is
an
expressed
exclusion.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
we
gave
that
notice
prior
to
the
time
that
the
employer
indicated
any
intention
of
the
plant
closing.
the
issue
of
severance
pay
was
not
before
anyone
because
so
far
as
we
understood
that
plant
was
to
remain
open
forever.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
we
had
given
notice
that
the
contract
was
to
be
out
of
effect
following
the
time
we
would
be,
pardon
me,
part
of
the
time
that
we
intended
to
strike.
we
never
struck.
we
gave
notice
in
order
to
strike
for
new
conditions.
we
at
no
point
ever
indicated
an
intention
or
desire
to
strike
for
old
contractual
conditions.
we
were
not
even
aware
that
we
had
a
contractual
problem.
we
did
not
know
that
there
was
a
severance
pay
question.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
of
course
not,
because
we
knew
of
no
arbitrable
issue.
we
were
bargaining
for
the
prospect
of
conditions.
the
only
time
that
we
dealt
with
retroactive
conditions
was
after
the
employer
suddenly
advised
us
that
he
was
closing
the
plant
and
sometime
subsequent
to
that,
denied
us
the
right
to
severance
pay.
he
in
fact
paid
vacation
pay.
some
of
the
questions
by
your
honor
and
by
justice
marshall
dealt
with
the
question
of
vacation
pay
and
it
is
in
this
court
that
the
petitioner
is
now
saying
it
had
no
vacation
pay
obligation
but
yet
it
went
right
ahead
and
paid
them.
and
vacation
pay
is
indistinguishable
from
severance
pay,
and
certainly
as
regards
the
arbitrability
of
a
claim
for
severance
pay,
a
claim
that
is
based
upon
the
contract
itself.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
of
course
not.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
we
said
we
were
going
to
strike
in
order
to
get
a
higher
wage.
the
company
said,
well,
we
cannot
afford
that,
sorry,
we
are
going
to
close
that
plant.
then
we
said,
a
week
later,
well
you
can
close
the
plant
now,
pay
us
the
money
you
owe
us
under
our
contract.
so
that
the
timing
makes
absolutely
clear
that
any
threatened
strike
had
nothing
–
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
that
is
precisely
right,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor,
however
phrased,
whether
vested,
earned
–
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
whatever
the
phrasing,
i
think
the
fourth
circuit
stated
it
very
well.
the
nature
of
the
right
to
severance
pay
is
something
that
is
determined
by
the
parties,
by
their
intention.
the
question
of
who
is
to
determine
the
parties’
intention
has
been
answered
repeatedly,
and
whether
it
is,
as
here,
a
broad
arbitration
clause,
that
question
as
to
the
intent
of
the
parties
is
to
be
answered
by
the
arbitrator.
if
not,
we
would
have
a
situation
in
which
the
very
series
of
hypotheticals
that
were
presented
would
all
be
matters
for
the
already
overburdened
federal
courts.
i
think,
your
honor
asked
a
question
about
wages.
it
is
very
easy
to
say,
yes,
we
will
pay
the
wages
that
were
due
in
the
final
week.
but
what
if
there
is
a
dispute
over
those
wages?
in
that
circumstance,
would
there
not
then
be
a
federal
suit
for
$25,
a
difference
between
a
claim
of
wages
for
$75
and
$100?
i
think
it
is
clear
that,
beyond
any
question,
that
that
matter
is
one
for
arbitration
rather
than
the
courts
and
that
is
what
we
are
discussing
here,
because
our
claim
is
contractual
in
nature.
if
not
resolved
by
the
arbitrator,
it
must
be
resolved
by
the
courts.
and
if
to
be
resolved
by
the
courts,
it
would
inundate
an
already
overburdened
federal
judiciary.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
we
do
not
go
to
the
labor
board
to
enforce
contract
claims,
your
honor.
we
have
a
contract.
we
wanted
him
to
live
up
to
his
contract.
the
labor
board
is
not
the
place
to
enforce
contractual
claims.
section
301
is
the
place
to
enforce
contractual
claims.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
i
doubt
that
they
would
have
said
that
if
we
had
filed
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
whether
or
not
they
would
have
said
that
there
was
no
impasse,
it
is
something
else
again.
it
is
very
easy
in
this
court
to
say
that
they
had
not
bargained
to
impasse
on
the
issue.
they
might
have
had
an
entirely
different
position
before
the
national
labor
relations
board.
we
are
perfectly
prepared
to
submit
our
contract
claim
to
the
contractually
provided
method
for
adjustment.
why
should
we
go
to
the
labor
board
to
deal
with
an
issue
of
entirely
different
dimension?
that
would
be
ludicrous.
we
have
a
contract.
we
want
it
enforced,
and
we
want
it
enforced
in
the
way
that
the
contract
itself
provides.
we
have
a
contract
with
an
admittedly
broad,
to
use
the
company’s
phrase,
arbitration
clause,
a
clause
that
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
as
all-encompassing.
so
unlike
the
hypothetical
presented
by
justice
white,
we
do
not
have
an
arbitration
clause
that
is
in
any
way
limited.
we
rather
have
one
that
is
as
broad
as
can
be
and
given
that
clause,
and
given
this
court’s
decisions
saying
that
there
can
be
no
denial
of
arbitration
in
such
a
circumstance,
unless
one
can
say
that
no
interpretation
is
available,
it
is
clear
that
the
fourth
circuit’s
interpretation
of
this
arbitration
clause
and
this
contract
as
permitting
arbitration,
is
one
that
must
be
given
credence.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
for
so
long
as
contract
claims
can
be
made,
in
the
same
sense
that
a
suit
for
severance
pay
in
a
court
of
law
can
be
made
some
time
later,
or
in
the
same
way
that
a
suit
for
pension
might
come
at
some
time
substantially
subsequent
to
the
normal
expiration
of
the
contract.
if
such
a
claim
regarding
pension
came
up,
it
would
obviously
be
a
contract
claim
to
be
contractually
resolved
and
similarly,
a
claim
for
severance
pay
based
upon
a
contract
must
be
contractually
resolved
even
though
it
might
come
up
some
time,
significantly
subsequent
in
time.
we
do
not
have
that
issue
here.
the
demand
for
arbitration
followed
immediately
upon
the
notification
that
the
plant
was
closed
and
the
denial
of
the
severance
pay.
i
think
i
have
used
all
but
my
opponent’s
rebuttal.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
oh,
he
has
no
time,
and
that
being
so
we
will
pass
any
further
time,
your
honor,
in
the
case
now,
unless
there
are
any
further
questions.
