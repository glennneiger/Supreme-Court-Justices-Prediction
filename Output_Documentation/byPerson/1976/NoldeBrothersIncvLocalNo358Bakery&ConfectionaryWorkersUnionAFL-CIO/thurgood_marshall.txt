justice

marshall
two
questions.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
suppose
the
matter
was
in
arbitration
for
about
a
week
and
the
plant
closed
down
and
the
contract
was
gone?
would
that
arbitration
continue?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
if
there
was
this
man
who
claimed
that
he
was
not
paid
for
the
last
week
of
work?
he
could
maintain
that
under
the
contract,
of
course.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
under
the
contract.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
you
better
say
that
he
can
get
it
from
work
rather
than
out
of
the
contract.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
had
severed
the
man
on
friday,
he
would
have
had
arbitrable,
wouldnâ€™t
he?
