mr.
allan
l.
bioff
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
an
employer
may
be
required
to
arbitrate
a
dispute
between
the
employer
and
a
union,
where
the
dispute,
i.e.,
both
the
events
which
give
rise
to
the
alleged
liability
and
the
union’s
claim
concerning
that
liability,
all
occur
after
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
has
ended.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
undisputed.
the
employer,
nolde,
a
manufacturer
of
bakery
goods,
maintained
and
operated
a
bakery
plant
in
norfolk,
virginia
and
had
entered
into
a
labor
agreement
in
july
of
1970
with
the
respondent
union
which
had
a
term
extending
until
july
21,
1973.
however,
the
duration
clause
of
the
labor
agreement
provided
that
after
july
21,
1973
the
labor
agreement
would
remain
in
effect
until
either
a
new
agreement
was
reached
by
the
parties
or
either
party
gave
written
notice
to
the
other
of
cancellation.
the
labor
agreement
contained
a
severance
pay
provision.
that
provision,
in
general
terms,
stated
that
employees
with
three
or
more
years
of
continuous
service
with
the
employer
would
be
entitled
to
a
severance
payment
based
upon
a
formula
set
out
in
the
contract
upon
the
happening
of
certain
contingencies,
one
of
which
was
the
permanent
closing
of
the
plant.
the
agreement
also
contained
a
grievance
arbitration
procedure.
in
mid-may
1973,
the
union
gave
notice
to
the
company
pursuant
to
section
8(d)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
of
its
intention
to
negotiate
a
new
agreement,
and
negotiations
between
the
company
and
the
union
then
commenced
and
continued
for
a
period
of
some
three
months.
no
agreement
was
reached
by
the
parties
during
this
period
of
negotiation.
on
august
20,
1973
the
union
sent
to
the
company,
a
written
notice
of
seven-day
cancellation
of
the
contract
pursuant
to
the
duration
clause
of
the
agreement.
that
notice
was
sent
on
august
20,
1973
which
meant
that
the
labor
agreement
terminated
by
reason
of
the
union’s
notice
on
august
27,
1973.
the
negotiators
for
the
parties
met
on
august
31,
1973,
at
which
time
the
union
rejected
the
company’s
final
proposal
for
a
new
contract.
at
that
meeting,
the
union
advised
the
company
that
unless
the
company
accepted
the
union’s
proposals,
the
union
would
go
out
on
strike.
after
considering
the
union’s
proposals,
considering
its
financial
position,
the
employer
concluded
that
it
could
not
survive
at
its
norfolk,
virginia
plant
in
the
face
of
a
strike
and
it
accordingly
notified
the
union
that
effective
that
night,
august
31,
1973,
the
employer
was
permanently
closing
its
norfolk,
virginia
plant.
and
in
fact,
on
that
date,
the
employer
did
close
permanently
its
norfolk,
virginia
plant
and
on
that
date
it
terminated
the
employees
represented
by
the
union.
subsequent
to
the
plant
closing,
subsequent
to
the
termination
of
the
employees,
the
union
made
a
demand
upon
the
company
for
the
payment
of
severance
pay.
the
employer
declined
to
pay
severance
pay.
the
union
then
made
a
demand
upon
the
employer
to
arbitrate
the
issue
as
to
whether
the
employer
was
obligated
to
pay
the
severance
pay.
the
employer
declined
to
arbitrate.
in
both
instances,
the
employer’s
position
was
that
the
obligation
to
pay
severance
pay
and
the
duty
to
arbitrate,
both
were
extinguished
or
expired
when
the
contract
ended.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
yes,
sir.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
your
honor,
are
you
assuming
in
your
question
that
the
contract
had
been
terminated,
as
it
was?
our
position
is...
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
but
that
was
closed
a
year-and-a-half
or
so
later?
on
those
facts,
i
think
we
would
have
the
same
fact
situation
as
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
yes,
our
position
is
simply
this.
that
under
the
contract
the
employees
were
not
entitled
to
severance
pay
simply
because
there
was
no
contract
after
august
27,
1973.
that
is
not
to
say,
and
i
think
that
this
point
is
at
the
very
heart
of
this
litigation,
that
is
not
to
say
that
the
employees
were
automatically
divested
of
a
right
to
severance
pay
when
the
contract
terminated,
because
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
when
a
contract
ends,
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
that
are
set
forth
in
that
contract
continue
in
effect
until
such
time
as
either
the
employer
and
the
union
agree
to
new
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
or
the
employer
bargains
away
the
existing
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
by
bargaining
with
the
union
to
an
impasse.
in
this
case,
the
record
is
unclear
as
to
exactly
what
happened
on
august
31,
1973,
i.e.,
whether
the
union
made
any
demand
upon
the
employer
to
negotiate
with
the
employer
over
the
ending
of
severance
benefits.
thus,
it
is
unclear
whether
there
may
have
been
a
waiver
by
the
union
of
its
right
to
bargain
over
the
elimination
of
the
severance
benefits.
but
assuming
that
there
was
no
waiver
of
that
right,
and
assuming
that
the
employer
simply
unilaterally
ended
the
severance
benefits,
that
would
be
arguably
a
violation
of
section
885
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
one
of
the
remedies
for
which
might
have
been
the
payment
of
the
severance
benefits.
the
point
is
here,
the
union
never
filed
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
it
never
filed
a
complaint
with
the
labor
board
saying
the
employer
had
unilaterally
terminated
the
severance
benefits.
i
am
not
sure,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
answered
your
question
but
i
think
–
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
no,
sir.
assuming
the
contract
had
been
terminated,
severance
pay
would
not
be
enforceable
under
the
contract
because
the
contract
no
longer
existed.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
i
am
saying
that,
what
i
am
saying
is
whether
it
is
three
days,
three
weeks
or
three
years
after
the
termination
of
the
contract,
there
is
no
right
to
severance
pay
under
the
contract
because
the
contract
no
longer
exists.
consequently,
there
is
no
right
to
arbitrate
the
question
of
whether
or
not
severance
pay
is
owing,
again,
because
there
is
no
agreement
to
arbitrate
and
the
duty,
as
this
court
has
frequently
said,
to
arbitrate
depends
upon
the
existence
of
an
agreement
to
arbitrate.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
yes
sir.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
are
you
referring
to
an
arbitration
over
severance
pay
or
some
other
issue?
i
would
think
the
arbitration
would
continue
because
presumably
the
arbitration
provision
under
that
hypothetical
case
had
been
invoked
prior
to
the
terminal
date
of
the
agreement.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
you
are
assuming
that
the
man
works
monday
through
friday,
the
contract
ends
on
saturday.
can
he
then
arbitrate
the
issue?
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
probably
yes,
that
he
can.
but
i
think
–
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
yes,
sir.
i
think
the
difference
between
that
case.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
well,
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
case
you
put
and
the
case
that
is
at
bar
here
and
i
think
the
difference
is
simply
this.
when
the
individual
works
monday
through
friday,
the
contract
ends,
the
employer
refuses
to
pay
for
that
last
week’s
work.
i
think
that
issue
might
very
well
be
arbitrable
because
all
of
the
events
giving
rise
to
the
grievance
that
was
filed
occurred
while
the
contract
existed
and
indeed
the
employer’s
liability
for
the
payment
of
those
wages
came
into
existence
during
the
term
of
the
contract.
in
our
case,
the
difference
is
that
there
was
no
liability
created
for
severance
pay
until
after
the
contract
terminated.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
let
us
assume
the
contract
ends
on
saturday.
we
discharged
the
man
on
friday.
the
grievance
is
filed
on
monday.
it
would
be
our
position
that
that
grievance
is
arbitrable
because
the
event
giving
rise
to
a
claimed
liability
occurred
while
the
contract
existed.
if
the
man
was
discharged
on
monday
and
the
contract
expired
on
saturday,
it
would
be
our
position
that
that
discharge
grievance
would
not
be
arbitrable.
let
me
take
this
case,
now,
let
us
assume
that
there
is
a
provision
in
the
contract
that
says,
“an
employee
with
one
year
or
more
of
service
may
not
be
discharged
without
a
prior
warning
notice”.
and
let
us
assume
that
the
contract
expires
on
saturday
and
the
employer
discharges
the
employee
on
monday.
but
the
employee
has
not
had
a
prior
warning
notice.
it
would
be
our
position
on
those
facts
that,
that
discharge
is
not
subject
to
the
grievance
arbitration
procedure
simply
because
at
the
time,
the
discharge
occurred,
the
grievance
arbitration
procedure
no
longer
existed.
however,
that
employee
might
very
well
have
a
claim
before
the
national
labor
relations
board,
that
the
employer
had
unilaterally
changed
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
after
the
contract
ended
without
bargaining
with
the
union
because
the
pre-existing
term
and
condition
of
employment
was
that
employees
would
not
be
discharged,
i.e.
employees
with
more
than
a
year
of
service,
would
not
be
discharged
without
a
prior
warning
notice.
after
the
contract
ends,
the
employer
discharges
the
employee
without
a
prior
warning
notice,
hence,
there
is
a
change,
a
unilateral
change
in
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
and
the
employee
has
a
case
before
the
labor
board
under
885.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
that
is
the
test.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
that
is
not
our
case.
our
case
is
everything
happened
after
the
contract
expired.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
if
i
understand
your
hypothetical
correctly,
our
answer
to
that
would
be
no.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
yes
and
i
think
the
reason
that
it
would
not
be
is
because
simply
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
had
ended
prior
to
the
time
that
the
liability
for
pro
rata
vacation
came
into
existence.
now
again,
--
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
as
to
the
–
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
as
to
the
hours
that
he
worked
prior
to
the
terminal
date
of
the
contract,
we
would
say
that
that
gave
rise
to
an
arbitrable
issue
because
the
employer’s
liability
was
created
prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
--
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
well,
i
think
that
depends,
your
honor,
on
what
you
mean
by
a
vested
right.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
assuming
it
is
a
vested
right,
if
by
vested
right
you
mean
–
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
they
have
a
right
to
it
so
long
as
the
employer
and
the
union
have
not
bargained
it
away
during
the
hiatus
between
contracts.
therein
lies
the
whole
point
in
this
case.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
no,
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
contract
right
to
the
money
either,
because
there
is
no
contract.
the
right
to
the
money
stems
from
the
fact
that
the
severance
pay
obligation
becomes
a
term
and
condition
of
employment
after
the
agreement
ends
that
the
employer
may
not
unilaterally
change.
it
does
not
stem
from
a
contract.
the
terminology
“accrued
right”
and
“vested
right”
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
is
simply
a
label.
the
question
is
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
if
you
mean
by
an
accrued
right
that
the
employer
and
the
union
may
not
bargain
to
eliminate
it,
then
we
do
not
agree
there
is
such
a
thing
as
an
accrued
right
because
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
employer
and
the
union
can
bargain
to
eliminate
any
right
that
exists
under
a
labor
contract.
let
us
take
the
severance
pay
case.
let
us
take
our
case,
and
let
us
assume
that
instead
of
the
employer
simply
notifying
the
union
on
august
31,
1973
that
it
was
going
to
close
the
plant
and
it
was
not
going
to
pay
severance
pay,
assume
instead
the
employer
had
come
to
the
union
and
said,
"we
are
contemplating,
closing
the
plant.
we
are
in
poor
financial
condition,
we
do
not
want
to
pay
severance
pay.
we
want
to
negotiate
with
you
about
the
severance
pay"
and
they
do
negotiate.
now,
one
of
two
things
is
going
to
happen.
the
union
agrees
to
the
elimination
of
the
severance
pay
and
certainly
the
law
does
not
say
the
employer
and
the
union
cannot
agree
to
the
elimination
of
it.
and
if
they
do
eliminate
it
and
the
employer
then
closes
the
plant,
obviously
no
severance
pay
is
due.
but
let
us
assume..
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
could
the
union
agree
to
do
that
on
behalf
of
the
employees,
assuming
that
the
employees
authorize
the
union
to
do
it?
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
on
the
assumption
that
the
union
is
not
violating
its
duty
of
fair
representation,
yes.
i
am
assuming
that
the
union
is
authorized
to
negotiate
on
behalf
of
its
membership.
certainly,
your
honor,
let
us
take
our
severance
pay
case.
there
is
a
severance
pay
provision
in
the
contract
that
expired
august
27,
1973.
let
us
assume
that
instead
of
what
actually
occurred
here,
the
plant
remained
in
operation,
the
parties
bargained
for
a
new
contract
and
the
employer
said
in
those
negotiations,
"look,
we
want
to
eliminate
the
severance
pay
provision
from
the
next
contract."
and
let
us
further
assume
that
the
union
agreed
to
that
elimination
and
they
entered
into
a
contract
without
a
severance
pay
provision.
and
the
employer
then
closed
the
plant
under
the
succeeding
contract.
surely,
no
severance
pay
is
due
and
owing
under
those
facts.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
that
would
be
our
position,
at
least.
it
would
also
be
our
position
that,
even
assuming
the
union
did
not
agree
to
the
elimination
of
severance
pay,
the
employer
nevertheless
could
bargain
to
an
impasse
with
the
union
for
the
elimination
of
the
severance
pay
and
then
eliminate
it.
and
the
union
recourse
then
would
be
to
strike.
the
fundamental
thing
that
is
at
the
very
core
of
this
lawsuit,
and
it
is
a
very
important
issue,
is
that
the
fourth
circuit
has
confused
two
very
distinct
national
labor
policies.
the
first
national
labor
policy
is
that
when
you
have
an
existing
labor
agreement,
the
parties
are
encouraged
to
resolve
their
controversies
and
their
disputes
by
peaceful
means
pursuant
to
a
grievance
arbitration
procedure.
indeed,
that
is
spelled
out
in
the
labor
management
relations
act
in
section
203(d).
incidentally,
the
language
of
section
203(d)
is
very
interesting
because
it
says,
"final
adjustment
by
a
method
agreed
upon
by
the
parties
is
hereby
declared
to
be
the
desirable
method
for
settlement
of
grievances,
grievance
disputes
arising
over
the
application
or
interpretation
of
an
existing
collective
bargaining
agreement.”
now
that
is
one
very
important
national
labor
policy.
but
there
is
an
equally
important
national
labor
policy
that
comes
into
play
when
a
labor
contract
expires
and
during
the
hiatus
between
labor
contacts.
and
that
important
labor
policy
is
that
the
parties
are
free
to
bargain
collectively
and
to
utilize
their
respective
economic
strengths
to
obtain
what
they
desire
in
those
negotiations.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
that
is
right,
sir.
during
the
term
of
the
contract,
the
union
could
not
have
struck.
the
union
gave
notice
to
the
employer
to
terminate
the
agreement.
there
was
only
one
reason
that
the
union
gave
that
notice,
and
that
was
to
free
them
to
strike.
and
so
what
the
fourth
circuit
is
really
doing
here
is
the
fourth
circuit
is
saying,
"the
employer
has
a
duty
to
arbitrate
after
the
contract
ends
even
though
the
union
has
the
right
to
strike
during
that
period"
and
that
is
my
very
point.
that
is
why
the
two
national
labor
policies
which
are
very
distinct
--
one
that
exists
while
the
contract
is
in
force,
the
other
that
exists
during
the
hiatus
between
contracts
is
being
intermingled
or
confused
by
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
this
case.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
those
terms
and
conditions
that
existed
under
the
agreement.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
why,
sir?
because
that
is
what
the
national
–
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
as
interpreted
by
the
national
labor
relations
board,
when
a
labor
agreement
terminates,
the
employer
may
not
unilaterally
change
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
that
existed
under
the
expired
labor
contract
until
either
1)
it
negotiates
with
the
union
and
the
union
agrees
to
some
change,
2)
it
negotiates
with
the
union
and
they
reach
a
bona
fide
impasse
over
an
issue,
at
which
point
the
employer
may
then
unilaterally
change
that
condition.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
it
does.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
well,
the
point
is,
the
arbitration
clause,
the
labor
board
has
said,
and
we
cite
the
hilton
davis
case
in
our
brief,
the
arbitration
clause
is
not
a
term
and
condition
of
employment.
the
severance
pay
is.
so
the
union’s
remedy
here
was
the
labor
board,
not
arbitration,
and
that
is
wherein
the
fourth
circuit
has
committed
a
very
serious
error.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
no,
i
am
not,
your
honor,
i
am
not
conceding
that.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
well,
perhaps
i
have
overstated
my
position.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
the
record
is
not
clear,
there
could
conceivably
have
been
a
waiver
on
the
part
of
the
union
of
any
right
that
it
had
to
bargain
over
the
issue
of
the
elimination
of
the
severance
pay.
conceivably,
such
an
argument
could
be
made.
absent
that
kind
of
an
argument,
i
would
say
that
it
is
highly
likely
that
an
unfair
labor
practice
was
committed
by
the
elimination
of
a
severance
pay.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
because
the
union
went
to
the
wrong
forum.
because
the
union,
instead
of
going
to
the
labor
board,
went
to
the
united
states
–
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
i
am
really
not
sure,
i
think
around
$15,000.
but
the
point
is,
your
honor,
when
the
union
went
to
the
federal
district
court,
and
then
when
the
union
went
to
the
fourth
circuit,
it
created
some
law
that
is
extremely
detrimental
to
the
principles
of
labor
law
that
those
of
us
that
practice
in
the
field
rely
on,
and
so
this
case
involves
not
money,
but
principle.
a
very
important
one,
i
might
add.
the
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
before
closing
about
the
fourth
circuit’s
decision
is
that
obviously
it
rewrites
the
contract,
the
parties’
contract.
the
labor
agreement
and
the
duration
clause
says
that
after
july
21,
1973,
that
either
party,
upon
seven
days
written
notice
could
terminate
the
agreement
and
i
think
it
said
could
terminate
this
agreement.
now,
this
agreement
means
every
provision
in
the
agreement,
not
some
of
them,
but
all
of
them.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
i
would
have
no
problem
with
that.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
yes,
that
is
the
way
they
read
it.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
yes,
it
is
a
very
great
issue
of
law
because
they
did
not
just
–
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
it
was
not
a
matter,
your
honor,
of
simply
construing
or
interpreting,
it
was
a
matter
of
rewriting.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
that
would
be
my
conclusion
and
that
is
the
way
i
would
read
the
decision
because
you
cannot
read
this
contract
and
conclude
that
the
arbitration
agreement
did
not
end
on
august
27,
1973.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
yes,
well,
i
think,
the
way
i
read
the
fourth
circuit’s
opinion,
and
i
suppose
it
can
be
read
different
ways
by
different
people,
but
the
way
i
read
it,
it
says
that
the
court
agrees
that
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
ended
when
the
contract
terminated
but
the
court’s
rationale
is
that
there
are
certain
rights
under
a
labor
agreement,
which
they
call
accrued
rights,
which
flow
from
the
contract
and
hence,
even
though
the
agreement
arbitrate
is
ended,
those
rights
are
nevertheless
subject
to
arbitration
because
they
flow
from
the
contract.
i
do
not
read
the
court’s
opinion
as
saying
that
they...
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
well,
the
piano
--
let
us
take
the
piano
case.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
wiley
is
tougher.
i
do
not
have
too
much
trouble
with
the
piano
case
because
in
the
piano
case,
the
plant
closed,
the
employees
were
terminated,
the
demand
to
rehire
them
at
the
new
plant
in
french
lick,
indiana
was
made
and
the
refusal
by
the
employer
to
agree
to
the
rehiring
was
all
of
those
facts
occurred
before
the
contract
ended.
the
only
thing
that
occurred
afterward
was
the
fact
that
they
did
not
rehire
people
at
french
lick.
in
other
words,
your
honor,
the
piano
case
would
be
analogous
to
our
case
if
–
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
it
depends
on,
i
think
—
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
well,
i
would
not
put
it
that
way
because
i
would
say
the
dispute
arose
in
that
case
before
the
contract
ended.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
the
contract
had
ended.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
if
you
read
piano
workers
that
way
—
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
it
is
a
tough
case
for
us,
that
is
correct.
i
think
our
case
would
be
analogous
to
piano
workers
if
the
facts
in
our
case
were,
that
prior
to
august
27,
1973,
i.e.,
prior
to
the
ending
date
of
the
contract,
the
company
had
closed
the
plant.
the
company
had
terminated
the
employees,
the
union
had
made
a
demand
for
severance
pay.
the
contract
then
ends,
the
company
then
refuses
to
pay
the
severance
pay.
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
well
your
honor,
wiley
of
course,
can
be
distinguished
in
some
ways
from
our
situation
again
if
--
mr.
allan
l.
bioff
no,
in
wiley,
your
honor,
the
operative
facts,
the
events
over
which
the
dispute
arose
did
occur
before
the
contract
ended.
wiley
and
interscience
merged
before
the
agreement
ended,
some
four
months
before
it
ended.
wiley
refused
to
honor
any
of
the
provisions
of
the
interscience
contract
before
the
contract
ended.
the
union
filed
grievances
over
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
contract
before
the
contract
ended.
wiley
refused
to
process
those
grievances
before
the
contract
ended,
and
the
suit
to
compel
arbitration
under
section
301
occurred
before
the
contract
ended.
so
in
that
sense,
the
case
is
quite
different
than
ours,
where
the
case
gives
us
trouble
as
the
court’s
language
about
accrued
rights,
the
union
relies
on
very
strongly
here.
i
believe,
your
honor,
my
time
is
up.
