unknown
speaker
suppose,
hypothetically,
that
instead
of
that
sequence,
the
parties
had
rocked
along
for
another
year
or
two
without
a
contract,
as
i
am
sure
you
know
sometimes
happens.
unknown
speaker
and
then
after
a
year,
a
year-and-a-half,
the
employer
closed
the
plant.
would
you
say
that
the
right
to
the
severance
pay
which
you
now
claim
was
vested
under
the
written
contract
would
be
enforceable
a
year–and-a-half,
two
years
later?
unknown
speaker
contract
terminated
but
employment
continued
and
the
factory
continued
operating.
unknown
speaker
five
years
later
then,
it
still
would
have
to
be
the
same,
wouldn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
your
answer
to
be
that
no
matter
how
much
time
had
elapsed,
the
men
kept
on
working,
the
factory
is
open.
but
when,
as
and
if
the
factory
was
closed,
severance
pay
under
the
original
contract
would
be
enforceable.
unknown
speaker
then
i
did
misunderstand
you.
i
thought
you
said
at
first
it
would
be
the
same
whether
it
was
three
days,
three
weeks
or
three
years.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
you
emphasize
the
critical
fact
being
that
the
liability
totally
matured
prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
agreement,
gave
rise
to
the
duty
to
arbitrate,
as
i
understand
you.
you
say
all
the
events
supporting
the
claim,
supporting
the
liability
happened
before
the
contract
expired.
is
it,
am
i
mistaken?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
stating
it
awkward.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
understand
that,
but
you
would
concede
that
you
had
a
duty
to
arbitrate
if
the
events
occurred
before
the
contract.
well
supposing
you
have
a
vacation
pay
case
and
it
is
generally
considered
to
be
a
vested
interest,
a
vacation
pay
but
the
christmas
does
not
come
until
two
weeks
after
termination
of
the
contract.
would
the
claim
for
the
pro
rata
share
of
vacation
pay
be
arbitrable
or
not?
i
am
stating
it
awkwardly
but
assume
that
the
contract
expires
after
ten
months
of
vacation
pay
vested
but
before
he
actually
gets
a
vacation.
could
he
arbitrate
that?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
thought
you
would
say.
unknown
speaker
supposing
a
man
was
fired
during
the
middle
of
the
pay
period.
normally
you
pay
by
the
month
or
the
week
--
the
contract
expires
in
the
middle
of
the
pay
period,
would
there
be
duty
to
arbitrate
there?
unknown
speaker
say
‘no’
again,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
if
the
right
to
severance
pay
is
a
vested
right,
your
liability
was
created
at
least
to
the
extent,
to
a
certain
extent
was
created
–
unknown
speaker
you
can
assume
it
is
a
vested
right
here,
what
duty
do
you
have
to
these
people,
would
you
have
to
pay
them
then?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
they
have
a
right
to
the
accrued
termination
pay
that
they
have
earned
even
though
a
succeeding
contract
may
not
provide
for
it.
unknown
speaker
let
me
put
the
case
a
little
differently.
assume
the
contract
said
in
words,
"you
will
earn
'x'
dollars
of
severance
pay
for
so
many
months
that
you
worked,
and
in
no
circumstances
shall
this
be
bargained
away,
taken
away
or
any
other.
you
get
it
when
you
leave
the
employer
for
any
reason
whatsoever
and
then
you
did
not
pay
him.
would
they
have
aright
to
--
clear-contract
right
to
the
money?
but
then
you
disputed
over
the
amount
or
something
like
that.
would
that
be
arbitrable?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
so
sure
i
accept
your
proposition,
that
they
--
could
the
union
in
behalf
of
the
employees
give
the
company
some
money?
could
they
just
say,
well,
every
employee
will
give
you
a
$100
at
the
end
of
this
term
in
order
to
support
this
failing
company?
unknown
speaker
but,
just
under
the
general
right
to
bargain
--
as
exclusive
bargaining
agent,
would
they
have
the
right
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
sure,
i
agree.
unknown
speaker
the
union
could
only
strike
here
because
the
contract
had
expired?
unknown
speaker
because
there
was
a
promise
not
to
strike
in
return
for
an
agreement
to
arbitrate?
unknown
speaker
what
rates
of
pay
and
working
conditions
are
applied
during
the
period
from
august
27th
to
august
31st?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
there
was
no
agreement
covering
the
--
according
to
your
submission,
the
rates
of
pay
or
the
working
conditions
during
that
period
after
the
agreement
had
been
abrogated,
terminated.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
why
doesn’t
that
principle
apply
here?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
apply
here
to
effect
the
severance
pay
and
the
arbitration
thereof.
unknown
speaker
are
you
conceding
that
it
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
not
to
pay
severance
then?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that
is
exactly
what
you
said.
unknown
speaker
maybe
you
better
explain
it.
unknown
speaker
then
what
is
the
point
of
all
this
litigation?
surely,
you
will
have
to
pay
it
sooner
or
later.
unknown
speaker
couldn’t
you
avoid
all
of
this
for
us
by
simply
writing
them
a
check?
how
much
money
is
involved
in
this
case,
anyway?
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
that
the
contract
had
said
expressly
in
the
arbitration
clause,
and
this
arbitration
clause
shall
apply
to
the
settlement
of
any
rights
accrued
prior
to
the
expiration
of
this
contract.
and
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
they
intended
to
arbitrate
any
dispute
over
an
accrued
right,
even
though
the
dispute
arose
after
the
termination
of
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
you
have
no
problem
now.
is
it
not
possible
to
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
as
just
reading
the
contract
that
way?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
an
interpretation,
why
should
we
disagree
with
their
interpretation
of
a
collective
bargaining
contract?
that
is
not
a
great
issue
of
law,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
how
they
construed
some
words,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
it
is
not
possible
to
read
their
opinion
that
way.
you
are
saying
that
they
concluded
there
is
a
duty
to
arbitrate
on
policy
grounds,
or
some
other
reason
rather
than
the
terms
of
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are
some
words
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
indicates
that
as
they
understood
the
contract,
it
was
just
a
promise
to
arbitrate
even
after
the
contract
was
over,
about
a
right
that
was
arguably
vested,
as
we
might
call
it,
before
the
contract
was
over.
and
the
issue
was
whether
it
was
vested
or
not.
unknown
speaker
they
say
that
this
court
did
the
same
thing
in
wiley
and
in
the
piano
case.
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
tough
case
for
you.
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
the
dispute
arose
at
a
time
when
on
the
face
of
it,
the
contract
had
expired,
including
the
agreement
to
arbitrate.
unknown
speaker
is
not
that
right.
unknown
speaker
at
the
time
of
the
refusal
to
hire
—
unknown
speaker
the
contract
had
ended
and
it
was
at
that
time
that
arbitration
was
demanded.
unknown
speaker
at
that
time,
on
the
face
of
it,
there
was
no
duty
to
arbitrate
because
the
contract
had
expired.
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
tough
case.
unknown
speaker
it
just
compares
with
wiley.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
the
language
in
wiley
as
applied
to
this
case
that
the
question
of
arbitrability
is
one
for
the
court
to
decide?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
any
time,
at
least
arguably,
a
right
has
accrued
under
a
labor
contract,
the
arbitration
clause
will
survive
the
termination
of
the
contract
unless
there
is
some
specific
provision
against
it?
unknown
speaker
you
think
that
is
wiley?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
know
about
the
steelworkers.
what
about
the
rule
that
in
order
to
force
an
employer
or
a
union
to
arbitrate,
there
has
to
be
a
promise
to
arbitrate?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
you
have
to
find
that
the
promise
was
intended
to
apply
after
the
termination
of
the
contract
in
which
the
promise
is
included.
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
my
point,
my
point
is
where
do
you
get
the
notion
that
a
month
after
a
contract
has
expired,
that
a
right
that
is
accrued
prior
to
the
termination
of
the
contract
has
to
be
arbitrated?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
the
contract
has
expired.
those
words
are
now
gone.
unknown
speaker
if
--
the
question
is,
is
there
a
right
to
arbitrate?
that
is
the
question.
unknown
speaker
oh
no,
well,
you
can
do
that
in
301
suit.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
is
your
position
but
in
order
to
sustain
it,
you
have
got
to
show
that
there
was
a
promise
to
arbitrate.
unknown
speaker
but
the
promise
has
expired.
unknown
speaker
i
agree
with
that.
i
could
agree
wholly
with
that
without
also
agreeing
that
any
disputes
about
those
rights
have
to
be
arbitrated.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
you
would
concede
that
the
arbitration
clause,
and
the
arbitration
clause
said
that
this
promise
to
arbitrate
shall
not
apply
after
the
termination
of
the
contract.
did
you,
or
you
would
not
be
making
this
argument.
unknown
speaker
your
client
is
hardly
in
a
position
to
raise
much
question
about
fortuity
since
it
was
the
one
that
gave
notice
of
termination.
unknown
speaker
that
was
not
in
the
context
of
an
expired
contract.
that
was
in
the
context
of
what
issues
under
the
currently
administered
contract
were
arbitrable.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
were
you
bound
to
arbitrate,
suppose
when
you
made
the
demand
for
severance
pay
the
employer
said,
let
us
arbitrate.
would
you
have
been
bound?
unknown
speaker
after
the
termination
of
the
contract?
unknown
speaker
and
therefore,
your
strike
was
in
breach
of
the
agreement?
unknown
speaker
you
gave
notice,
wasn’t
it?
you
gave
notice
that
you
were
going
to
strike.
unknown
speaker
well
now,
just
assume
that
you
had
struck.
let
us
assume
that
the
moment
you
gave
notice
you
were
going
to
strike,
you
struck.
unknown
speaker
the
strike
during
the
termination
of
the
contract
would
have
been
forbidden
by
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
you
had
a
‘no
strike’
clause
in
the
contract
and
it
was
expressly
in
return
for
a
promise
to
arbitrate.
unknown
speaker
if
you
were
bound
to
arbitrate,
and
the
arbitration
clause
was
still
in
existence,
you
had
no
business
giving
notice
to
strike.
unknown
speaker
was
there
a
contract
when
you
gave
the
notice
to
strike?
unknown
speaker
you
did
not
give
notice
of
any
intent
to
strike
over
an
arbitrable
issue,
did
you?
unknown
speaker
though
i
understand
that
the
time
you
gave
the
notice
of
intention
to
strike,
there
was
no
contractual
arbitrable
issue
to
which
you
were
promised
not
to
strike,
apply.
unknown
speaker
that
did
not
arise
until
the
severance
pay
issue
arose
and
that
could
not
arise
until
the
plant
was
shut
down?
unknown
speaker
but
i
want
to
be
clear.
your
answer
to
my
brother
white
is,
at
the
time
you
gave
the
notice
you
were
going
to
strike,
there
existed
no
arbitrable
issue?
no
contractual
issue
for
arbitration
to
which
the
promise
not
to
strike
applied?
unknown
speaker
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
the
contractual
issue
with
respect
to
severance
pay
is
simply
whether
or
not
the
obligation
is
a
vested
right
or
not?
unknown
speaker
or
accrued,
whatever
it
is.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
say
about
his
argument
that
all
he
you
had
to
do
was
go
to
the
labor
board
and
file
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
and
you
would
have
been
paid?
unknown
speaker
but,
he
says
that
by
refusing
to
pay
you,
they
changed
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
unilaterally
and
thereby
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
all
you
had
to
do
was
file
a
charge
and,
as
i
understand
them,
they
would
desperately
search
for
a
defense
and
then
pay
you.
unknown
speaker
how
long
does
this
arbitration
clause
survive
the
termination
of
the
contract?
