mr.
smith,
what
happens
if
i
were
to
take
out
a
$10,000
policy
today
to
be
paid
quarterly,
and
i
paid
the
first
quarterly
installment
and
died
tomorrow?
justice

f.
powell,
jr.
but
the
company
would
have
to
set
up
the
full
reserve
today.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
that
is
required
by
state
law;
it
is
not
just
a
company
assumption.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
in
requiring
the
maintenance
of
certain
ratios,
particularly
with
respect
to
surplus,
don't
state
regulatory
commissions
treat
the
reserves
as
a
full
liability?

a
ratio
between
its
reserves
and

justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
just
fictions.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
your
basic
position
as
i
understand
it
is
to
advocate
consistency
in
the
practice
of
insurance
companies
in
accord
with
reality,
and
the
reality
certainly
is
that
loading
includes
a
substantial,
inevitably

mr.
hughes,
before
you
start,
would
you
reduce
that
premium
to
$100,
please?
