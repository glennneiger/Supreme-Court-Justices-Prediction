we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
no.
75-1771,
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
v.
standard
life
&
accident.
mr.
smith,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
it
is
"owed",
it
is
not
owed
in
the
sense
of
a
note
at
the
bank,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
reserves
the
option
not
to
pay
it
at
all.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
take
another
hypothetical,
one
a
little
more
favorable
to
justice
powell.
he
pays
a
$100,000
premium
and
pays
the
first
quarter,
$25,
000.00,
and
does
not
die
but
lives.
the
policy
lapses
after
the
grace
period,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
internal
revenue
treat
the
$75,000
premium
which
he
has
never
paid?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
speak
of
that
as
though
these
two
things
were
quite
alien
and
incompatible.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
is
one
thing
to
recognize
that
careful
business
practice
may
lead
to
larger
depreciation
than
the
government
would
allow
for
tax
purposes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
page
were
you
on
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
would
agree
that
where
they
are
equally
valid,
wouldn't
you,
or
you
would
say
neither
of
them
is
valid?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
that
point,
i
wish
you
would
pursue
for
me
the
hypothetical
question
i
put
to
mr.
smith
about
justice
powellâ€™s
$100,000
premium.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
smith
would
not
agree
to
that;
he
wants
a
larger
tax.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
you
and
mr.
smith
disagree.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
with
a
large,
established
company,
the
loading
plus
the
commission
itself
in
the
first
year
means
that
there
is
no
net
income
to
the
insurer
in
the
first
year.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
was
speaking
of
real
income,
not
taxable
income.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
tell
us
precisely
what
sentence
you
were
referring
to
in
818
that
the
government
is
reading
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
just
said
that
they
were
reading
out
one
of
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
zinn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
going
over
old
ground
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
of
course,
as
long
as
the
courts
were
going
that
way,
you
did
not
need
to
worry
about
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
75-1771,
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
against
standard
life
and
accident
company,
and
76-423,
puyallup
tribe
against
washington
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stevens.
