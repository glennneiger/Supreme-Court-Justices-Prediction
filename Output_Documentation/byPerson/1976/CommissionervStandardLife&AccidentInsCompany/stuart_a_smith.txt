mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
federal
income-tax
case
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
it
presents
a
question
of
major
fiscal
importance
involving
the
taxation
of
practically
every
life-insurance
company.
the
tax
statute
that
we
will
be
dealing
with
this
morning
imposes
a
unique
preferential
system
of
taxation
on
life-insurance
companies.
it
recognizes
that
life-insurance
companies
are
required
to
add
amounts
of
both
premium
income
and
investment
income
to
an
account
called
policyholder
reserves
in
order
to
be
able
to
have
enough
sufficient
funds
to
meet
future
claims.
what
the
statute
does
in
brief
is
to
permit
a
deduction
from
premium
income
for
additions
to
reserves
and
to
provide
a
computation
by
which
investment
income
is
broken
down
into
two
segments;
that
is,
the
portion
of
investment
income
and
at
the
policyholder
reserves
is
excluded
from
the
tax
base,
and
the
portion
of
investment
income
which
is
allocable
to
the
company’s
surplus
is
subject
to
current
tax.
now,
the
case
involves
a
particular
kind
of
premium
called
deferred
and
uncollected
premiums,
which
i
will
shortly
define.
but
suffice
it
to
say
at
the
outset
that
until
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
four
circuits,
the
fourth,
fifth,
seventh
and
sixth,
and
the
tax
court
had
upheld
the
commissioner’s
position
that
such
premiums
--
that
is,
deferred
and
uncollected
premiums
--
had
to
be
consistently
taken
into
account
in
computing
three
statutory
categories:
assets,
premium
income,
although
the
statute
refers
to
it
as
gross
amount
of
premiums,
and
reserves.
here
the
tenth
circuit
has
reached
what
we
believe
is
an
extraordinary
and
surprising
result.
it
has
held
that
these
deferred
and
uncollected
premiums
are
to
be
included
in
reserves,
but
nevertheless
excluded
from
the
corresponding
tax
computations
of
assets
and
premium
income.
we
believe
the
decision
is
unprecedented,
and
its
unprecedented
and
peculiar
quality
is
underscored
by
the
fact
that,
as
the
briefs
disclose
and
the
arguments
this
morning
will
doubtless
confirm,
the
life-insurance
industry
itself
has
disavowed
the
approach
taken
by
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
before
i
describe
the
facts
of
the
case,
i
think
it
will
be
helpful
and
it
will
put
the
issues
in
proper
focus
if
i
set
forth
for
the
court
three
elements
before
moving
on.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals’
decision
turned
in
part
on
state
law.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
possibly,
although
our
position
is
that
a
state
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
is
a
national
issue.
i
think
the
state
law,
the
oklahoma
law
involved
in
this
case,
is
typical
of
the
computational
reserve
modes
imposed
by
most
states.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
it
is
typical,
yes.
now,
i
would
like
to
set
out
three
elements
for
the
court
before
describing
the
facts
and
the
holdings
of
the
lower
courts,
and
there
i
would
like
just
to
define
deferred
and
uncollected
premiums;
i
would
then
like
to
describe
the
nature
of
a
life-insurance
reserve,
which
is
the
central
component
of
the
tax
computation,
and
the
relationship
of
that
reserve
to
premiums;
and
then
i
would
like
to
describe
in
detail
the
mechanics
of
this
tax
statute.
deferred
and
uncollected
premiums
are
a
particular
kind
of
premiums
used
in
selling
life
insurance.
now,
a
policyholder
has
the
option
to
pay
his
premium
in
full
as
of
the
anniversary
date,
or
he
can
pay
it
in
installments.
if
he
pays
it
in
installments,
which
are
typically
monthly,
quarterly
or
semi-annually,
the
amount
which
is
due
to
be
paid
after
the
close
of
the
calendar
year
--
because
insurance
companies
by
statute
are
required
to
report
their
income
on
a
calendar
year
--
the
amount
which
will
come
in
after
the
calendar
year,
but
before
the
next
anniversary
date,
are
called
deferred
premiums.
now,
there
is
another
kind
of
premium
here
called
uncollected
premiums.
those
premiums
are
amounts
which
the
policyholder
owes
right
now,
but
for
one
reason
or
another
has
not
paid.
they
are
called
premiums
due
and
payable,
or
they
are
also
known
as
uncollected
premiums.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
it
is
not
owed,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly,
and
he
can
have
his
life
insurance
lapse.
but
what
i
am
speaking
of
essentially
is
sort
of
two
types
of
premiums,
those
which
your
quarterly
payment
is
not
due
yet
--
that
is
a
deferred
premium
--
and
then
if
the
date
passes
when
it
should
have
been
paid
and
is
not
paid,
that
is
known
as
an
uncollected
premium.
and
these
two
types
are
known
in
the
aggregate
as
deferred
and
uncollected
premiums.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
we
are
only
talking
about
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right,
because
i
think
after
the
grace
period,
which
i
will
describe,
i
think
it
would
no
longer
be
an
uncollected
premium;
i
think
the
policy
would
lapse,
and
other
mechanics
would
take
over.
now,
the
question
presented
in
this
case
involves
the
proper
tax
treatment
under
the
current
statute,
which
came
in
in
1959,
for
these
deferred
and
uncollected
premiums
under
the
two
principle
computations
under
the
statute:
the
computation
for
premium
income,
which
is
colloquially
referred
to
as
phase
two,
and
the
computation
of
taxable
investment
income,
which
is
commonly
referred
to
as
phase
one.
let
me
now
turn
if
i
can
to
the
nature
of
a
life-insurance
reserve
and
its
relationship
to
premiums.
the
business
of
life
insurance,
i
think
as
we
all
know,
is
essentially
the
shifting
of
the
risk
of
death
from
the
insured
to
the
insurer
for
a
price,
and
that
price,
that
consideration,
is
called
the
premium.
the
amount
of
the
premium
is
calculated
on
a
particular
assumption,
and
that
assumption
is
that
the
insurance
company
will
set
aside
certain
portions
of
its
premiums
that
are
received
and
it
will
invest
those
premiums,
and
those
premiums
will
earn
interest
and
the
whole
accumulated
fund
will
be
sufficient
to
meet
claims
of
policyholders
as
they
die.
now,
the
gross
premium
is
the
amount
that
the
policyholder
actually
pays,
and
that
is
divided
in
turn
into
two
subordinate
elements:
the
net
valuation
premium
and
another
element
called
loading.
now,
the
net
valuation
premium
is
the
amount
computed
under
particular
mortality
and
interest-rate
assumptions
that
the
company
assumes
that
it
must
take
into
account
in
order
that
these
funds
will
accumulate
at
a
particular
interest
rate
and
that
it
will
have
a
sufficient
amount
to
pay
claims
as
they
arise.
so
the
net
valuation
portion
of
any
particular
premium
is
the
amount
that
the
company
has
to
set
aside
and
invest
in
order
to
meet
these
future
claims.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
the
state
law
sets
up,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
certain
minimum
reserve
valuation
standards
in
order
to
make
sure
that
insurance
companies
will
be
able
to
pay
off
their
claims
and
states
might
impose
certain
assumptions
or
whatever.
so
to
that
extent,
it
does
depend
on
state
law.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
because
the
states
have
an
interest
in
making
sure
that
when
people
pay
premiums
over
a
lifetime
that
they
are
not
going
to
be
faced
with
an
insolvent
insurance
company
which
won't
be
able
to
pay
off
on
the
claims.
now,
the
reserve,
the
life-insurance
reserve,
is
this
amount
that
the
company
must
set
aside
to
meet
its
future
claims.
so
the
reserve
is
defined
universally
by
the
life-insurance
texts
as
the
sum
of
these
net
valuation
premiums
taken
in
year
by
year,
plus
the
interest
at
the
assumed
rate
minus
the
death
claims
that
are
going
to
be
paid
out,
and
that
at
any
given
point
in
time
is
the
amount
that
the
company
must
have
on
hand,
so
to
speak,
or
be
set
aside,
as
the
tax
statute
refers
to
it,
to
meet
future
claims.
the
loading
element
is
the
difference
between
the
gross
premium
and
the
net
valuation
premium.
it
is,
so
to
speak,
analogous
to
a
gross
profit
margin.
if
you
were
to
buy
something
at
$10
and
sell
it
at
$15,
you
would
have
to
pay
out
certain
expenses
out
of
the
5;
but
that
$5
would
be
a
gross
profit
margin,
which
is
designed
to
cover
various
costs
that
you
have
and
also
have
a
profit
and
also
to
be
able
to
pay
dividends
to
your
shareholders.
the
life-insurance
texts,
and
this
is
significant,
all
define
a
life-insurance
reserve
as
derived
from
premiums.
this
is
undisputed.
and
the
tax
statute,
section
801(b)(1)(b)
uses
the
term
in
defining
reserves
as
amounts
set
aside
to
meet
future
claims.
it
is
essential
that
there
be
this
set-aside
notion
so
that
the
company
has
the
amounts
to
cover
its
reserve
liabilities.
so
i
think
that
it
is
fair
to
say
that
there
is
a
direct
and
fundamental
relationship
between
reserves
and
premiums,
and
indeed
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
early
tax
decisions
of
this
court
like
mccoach
versus
insurance
company
of
north
america,
new
york
life-insurance
company
v.
edwards,
speak
in
these
terms.
they
talk
about
amounts
reserved
from
premiums.
so
i
think
that
that
aspect
of
the
case
is
fairly
well
undisputed.
turning
now
to
the
particular
details
of
the
life-insurance
company
income
tax
act
of
1959,
which
the
court
last
considered
in
the
atlas
life-insurance
company
case,
this
statute
recognizes
that
life-insurance
companies
are
unlike
the
ordinary
taxpayer
and
don't
have
unfettered
discretion
as
to
how
to
deal
with
their
gross
receipts,
and
they
must
set
aside
amounts.
so
it
permits
certain
exclusions
and
deductions
of
amounts
from
two
separate
kinds
of
computations
in
order
to
cover
the
reserve
liabilities.
this
concept
of
reserve,
which
as
i
said
is
derived
from
premiums,
is
the
central
component
of
the
statutory
system.
and
the
statutory
computations,
which
are
indeed
complicated,
are
essentially
designed
to
measure
the
amounts
that
the
company
has
to
add
to
its
reserves
and
to
exclude
them
from
tax
or
to
provide
for
deductions.
now,
there
are
two
primary
categories
of
computations.
there
is
a
computation
of
taxable
investment
income,
because
as
i
said
the
company
sets
aside
these
amounts
and
they
are
going
to
earn
interest
and
dividends
on
investments.
indeed,
as
the
court
said
in
atlas,
they
must
invest
because
if
they
do
not
they
are
not
going
to
have
enough
under
their
assumptions
to
pay
off
the
claims.
then
there
is
a
second
category,
which
the
statute
refers
to
as
gain
from
operations,
which
is
essentially
income
from
all
sources,
including
total
taxable
investment
income
plus
all
sorts
of
other
income
that
the
company
has,
for
example,
underwriting
gains;
in
other
words,
the
amount
of
premiums
that
it
takes
in
less
the
amount
of
the
claims
that
it
has
to
pay
out.
now,
the
statute
imposes
a
tax
on
the
company’s
taxable
investment
income
plus
one
half
of
the
amount
by
which
its
total
gain
from
operations,
that
is
the
second
category,
exceeds
its
taxable
investment
income.
so
essentially
the
whole
statutory
mechanics
are
designed
to
make
these
computations
in
order
to
determine
what
amounts
have
to
be
set
aside
from
reserves
and
thereby
excluded
from
tax.
now,
the
phase-one
computations,
which
we
set
forth
in
formula
form,
i
think
the
most
graphic
way
to
understand
it
is
to
look
at
page
6
of
our
brief,
which
sets
forth
a
series
of
equations.
although
they
seem
rather
onerous,
they
are
really
not
when
you
sort
of
strip
away
some
of
the
detail,
because
what
you
have
essentially,
you
are
trying
to
take
the
company’s
total
investment
income
and
break
it
down
between
the
amounts
that
are
allocable
to
reserves
and
thereby
are
owned
by
the
policyholders
so
to
speak,
and
should
be
free
of
tax
and
the
amount
that
the
company
earns
for
itself,
which
does
not
have
to
set
aside
and
it
does
have
to
pay
a
tax
on
that.
so
essentially
looking
at
page
6,
the
court
will
see
essentially
three
formulas
and
then
a
variation
of
the
third
formula.
but
what
essentially
the
statute
prescribes
is
that
the
first
thing
that
the
company
has
to
do
is
compute
its
earnings
rate,
and
that
simply
is
its
investment
income
divided
by
its
assets,
and
then
it
multiplies
that
earnings
rate
times
its
reserves
and
that
yields
its
tax
exclusion.
and
as
you
can
see,
that
third
formula
essentially
substitute
for
earnings
rate
its
equivalent
in
the
first
formula,
which
is
investment
yield
over
assets,
and
so
you
have
a
formula
that
is
investment
yield
divided
by
assets
times
reserves
equals
the
tax
exclusions.
and
to
restate
the
formula,
it
is
essentially
you
can
see
from
the
last
where
the
equation
was
described
that
investment
yield
is
multiplied
by
a
fraction,
the
numerator
of
which
is
reserves
and
the
denominator
of
which
is
assets.
there
is
one
significant
thing
from
this-phase
one
computational
expressions,
as
we
have
set
it
out
in
the
briefs,
is
that
the
amount
of
the
exclusion
--
that
is,
the
amount
of
taxable
investment
income
which
is
free
of
tax
--
is
based
upon
a
proportionate
relationship
of
total
reserves
to
total
assets.
now,
the
phase-two
computation
is
a
much
more
traditional
netting
computation,
which
the
court
is
doubtless
familiar
from
other
income-tax
cases.
that
is,
it
essentially
says
take
in
your
gross
amount
of
premiums,
and
you
subtract
certain
deductions.
that
statute
is
set
out
in
809
of
the
code,
and
essentially
the
unique
deduction
that
the
life-insurance
companies
are
entitled
to
is
set
out
in
section
809(d)(2);
that
is,
it
gets
a
deduction
for
its
additions
to
reserves,
because
that
amount
of
premium
income
is
supposed
to
be
set
aside
in
order
to
meet
policyholder
claims.
i
think
with
these
sort
of
basics
in
mind,
i
can
now
turn
to
the
facts
of
this
case
and
put
the
matter
in
clear
focus.
the
respondent
in
this
case
is
a
life-insurance
company
in
oklahoma.
it
had
deferred
premiums,
as
most
life-insurance
companies
do,
and
it
also
had
due
and
unpaid
or
uncollected
premiums,
because
it
had
a
typical
grace
period
of
31
days.
now,
there
are
certain
things
that
the
courts
below
set
forth
which
are
plain
and
undisputed.
the
policyholder,
of
course,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
has
no
obligation
to
pay
deferred
or
uncollected
premiums.
but,
and
this
is
important,
respondent,
the
life-insurance
company,
had
no
obligation
to
continue
the
insurance
coverage
beyond
the
point
for
which
the
premiums
had
been
paid,
because
nonpayment
of
the
premiums
--
it
is
not
like
a
note
at
the
bank
--
results
in
the
lapse
of
the
policy.
the
only
thing
the
policyholder
is
going
to
get
is
his
cash
surrender
value
on
an
ordinary
whole-life
policy.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
if
you
pay
the
first
quarterly
installment
and
die
tomorrow,
mr.
justice
powell,
the
company
would
pay
off
the
$10,000;
but
state
statutes
permit
it
to
deduct
from
that
$10,000
the
amount
of
the
three
quarters
that
you
should
have
paid,
had
you
paid
it
at
the
beginning.
so
in
effect
the
company
never
losses
in
the
sense
that
it
is
always
going
to
get
its
premium
in
one
way
or
another.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
company,
and
that
is
what
i
am
about
to
get
to,
would
indulge
in
the
assumption
that
the
full
premium
was
paid
in
advance;
that
is,
a
computational
assumption
that
all
life-insurance
companies
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right,
it
is
a
computational
mode
which
is
required
by
state
law;
but
our
essential
position
is
that
that
is
only
one
element
of
the
statutory
definition
of
reserve.
the
other
element
of
the
statutory
definition
in
section
801(b)(1)(b)
is
that
there
would
be
an
amount
set
aside
to
meet
future
claims.
i
think
the
important
thing
about
this
case
is
that
the
reserves
that
it
sets
up,
the
full
premium
receipt
assumption,
so
to
speak,
is
simply
that:
an
assumption.
as
we
point
in
the
brief
and
i
will
describe
in
greater
detail
later,
it
is
based
on
a
historical
financial-reporting
practice
in
which
insurance
companies
for
the
last
hundred
years
have
been
engaged
in
a
full
premium
receipt
assumption.
but
the
important
thing
is
that
there
is
nothing
set
aside,
and
the
assumption,
the
fact
that
the
company
is
making
this
assumption,
does
not
affect
its
actual
liability
to
the
policyholders;
it
only
is
going
to
have
to
pay
out
with
respect
to
coverage
for
which
it
has
received
premiums.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
policy
lapses
after
the
grace
period,
that
is
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
is
not
premium
income.
it
would
not
be
premium
income,
and
it
would
not
enter
into
the
computations.
essentially,
that
is
the
point.
i
mean,
this
whole
thing
is
an
elaborate
fiction.
essentially,
the
fact
that
the
company
engages
in
a
full
premium-receipt
assumption
does
not
affect
its
actual
liabilities.
our
point
simply
is
that
if
it
is
going
to
engage
in
this
assumption,
the
commissioner
insists
that
it
apply
that
assumption
to
the
other
elements
of
the
statutory
computations;
that
is,
that
it
also
consistently
assume
that
it
has
these
premiums
for
purposes
of
assets
and
gross
amounts
of
premiums.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
and
as
we
point
out
in
the
brief,
there
is
an
offsetting
net
valuation
premium
asset;
but,
you
know,
the
insurance
texts
uniformly
state
that
this
is
a
fictional
asset.
this
is
a
quasi-asset
--
that
is
the
way
the
1871
convention
referred
to
it
--
and
the
fact
that
that
goes
on
the
balance
sheet
is
simply
a
device
that
the
companies
use
in
order
to
ensure
that
they
are
projecting
an
accurate
picture
of
their
solvency,
because
otherwise
they
would
have
to
commit
real
assets
to
cover
these
written-up
liabilities
and
they
would
impair
their
surplus.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
true,
and
that
simply
goes
into
the
actuarial
computation
that
a
policyholder
would
die.
but
the
fundamental
point
is
that
these
reserves,
although
they
are
written
up
on
the
full
net
valuation
portion
of
the
premium,
they
are
not
really
reserves
in
a
real
sense.
they
are
simply
done
that
way
to
avoid
the
burdensome
actuarial
work
of
computing
reserves
on
a
policy-by-policy
basis;
in
other
words,
if
the
companies
did
not
do
that,
they
would
have
to
compute
each
reserve
on
a
policy-by-policy
basis.
it
is
much
easier
for
the
companies
to
indulge
in
the
assumption,
"okay,
we
have
received
all
the
premiums
as
of
the
anniversary
date".
but
once
having
done
so,
the
commissioner
says
that
you
have
to
engage
in
the
corresponding
consistent
assumptions
and
take
the
full
amount
of
the
premiums
into
assets
and
gross
amount
of
premiums.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
aren't
they
an
accurate
statement?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
i
do
not
think
so,
mr.
justice
stevens.
the
insurance
texts
uniformly
state
that
it
is
not
a
real
liability.
the
reason
it
is
not
a
real
liability
is
the
fact
that
the
state
statutes,
if
you
die
after
the
first
installment
and
the
company
has
to
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
no,
because
the
state
statutes
permit
the
company
to
deduct
the
full
amount
of
the
other
three
quarters.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
and
insurance
texts
make
that
clear.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
it
is
written
up
as
a
liability;
but
the
point
is,
it
is
cancelled
out
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
this
quasi-asset
--
which
is
not
a
real
asset,
because
policyholders
do
not
pay
a
net
valuation
premium;
they
pay
the
full
premium
--
that
is
put
on
the
left
side
of
the
balance
sheet,
and
on
the
income
statement
they
have
this
elaborate
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
probably
does
for
state-law
purposes,
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
just
fictions,
exactly.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
took
the
position
that
the
industry
now
takes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
but
the
important
thing,
mr.
justice
stevens,
is
that
that
industry
position
is
purely
for
financial-reporting
purposes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
and
what
we
are
involved
with
here
is
trying
to
grapple
with
the
problem
of
how
these
deferred
and
uncollected
premiums
should
be
taken
into
account
for
tax
purposes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh,
they
are.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
i
do
not
suggest
that;
but
i
think
the
important
thing
here
is
that
congress
has
set
out
a
very
elaborate
computational
system
for
taxing
life-insurance
company
income,
and
they
have
specifically
relegated
the
industry
financial-reporting
practice
to
a
subordinate
and
interstitial
role.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
that
is
what
i
plan
to
turn
to
now,
and
i
would
actually
like
to
save
about
four
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
whole
thing.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
you
mean
the
federal
life-insurance
company
case.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
as
we
said
in
our
reply
brief,
we
dp
not
think
the
question
is
presented
in
this
case,
in
the
sense
that
there
is
no
claim
here.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
not
this
litigation.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
do
not
think
so,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
but
the
claim
here
is
for
a
deduction
for
loading,
and
i
think
as
the
seventh
circuit
pointed
out
in
that
case,
loading
is
an
income
item.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
there
are
elements
of
loading
that
are
expenses;
but
the
point
that
i
am
stressing
is
that
the
taxpayer
in
this
case,
when
i
say
that
the
issue
does
not
have
to
be
resolved
in
this
case,
i
am
simply
saying
the
court
does
not
have
to
address
it,
because
it
was
never
raised
in
the
tax
court
petition,
it
was
not
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
there
really
is
no
reason
for
the
court
to
reach
it.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that
there
is
a
substantial
force
to
that
contention,
and
let
me
simply
say
that
we
face
now
an
unbroken
line
of
decisions
in
three
circuits,
the
seventh,
the
eighth
and
the
fifth.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
it
is
a
question
of
timing;
but,
i
mean
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right.
i
mean,
that
is
the
name
of
the
game
in
a
sense
is
timing
of
income.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
let
me
quickly
just
make
a
few
points.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
did.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
true.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
i
do,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes;
but
i
think
if
you
carry
mr.
zinn’s
sort
of
initial
premise,
you
land
right
in
the
alternative
regulation,
because
none
of
these
things
are
accruable
items.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
i
do
not
think
that
is
so.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
you
do
not
land
in
the
naic
point,
because
essentially
the
insurance
texts
uniformly
provide,
and
there
has
been
no
refutation
from
the
other
side
on
that
point,
that
these
are
not
liabilities,
they
are
overstatements.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
one
lands
in
the
"except"
sentence
to
the
extent
that
the
naic
method
is
recognized
in
the
statute.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
am
sorry.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh,
absolutely
not.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
for
about
18
years.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absolutely
not,
not
that
i
am
aware
of.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
say,
i
suppose,
since
'60,
'59
or
'60.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
we
were
happy,
that
is
true,
although
we
submit
that
this
court
should
reverse
the
judgment
below.
