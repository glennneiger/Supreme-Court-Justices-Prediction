unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you,
just
so
that
i
will
have
it
in
my
mind
as
i
listen
to
the
rest
of
your
argument,
do
you
understand
that
the
state
law
was
critical
in
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
and
so
if
state
law
was
different,
they
might
have
come
out
differently?
unknown
speaker
because
you
said
a
while
ago
that
this
is
a
national
issue.
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
it
is
typical,
then.
unknown
speaker
justice:
oh,
oh,
loading,
that
is
income;
isn't
it,
mr.
smith?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hughes,
before
you
sit
down,
on
the
courtâ€™s
time
rather
than
your
colleague's,
may
i
ask
this
question?
unknown
speaker
yes,
that
is
expense
to
the
company.
unknown
speaker
mr.
justice,
unknown
speaker
just
to
address
it
in
a
rough
estimate,
it
would
be
70%,
80%?
unknown
speaker
yes.
