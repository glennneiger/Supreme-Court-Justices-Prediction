mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
say
that
the
word
"superficial"
is
right,
it
is
more
optical
than
real.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
well,
we
would
receive
it
in
next
year,
and
that
is
the
timing
matter.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
all
right,
sir.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
all
right,
sir.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
if
it
all
happens
within
the
same
calendar
year,
justice
blackmun,
then
there
is
no
question,
because
it
will
come
into
income.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
mr.
justice,
i
believe
that
this
may
be
one
of
the
problems
with
the
case,
then.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
page
5,
sir.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
neither
of
them
are
valid
--
no,
i
would
not
agree
that
they
are
equally
valid.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
with
the
chief
justice’s
permission,
i
will
reduce
it
to
$100.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
but
the
novelty
of
the
government’s
position
shows
up
there,
because
under
the
taxpayer’s
position,
assuming
that
justice
powell
survives,
the
$75
would
come
into
income
in
the
succeeding
year
if
paid.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
oh,
under
the
government’s
primary
position,
at
the
end
of
the
year
the
deferred
and
uncollected
--
and
under
the
position
of
the
four
circuits
--
the
gross
premiums,
not
the
net
premiums
except
as
modified
then
by
federal
in
great
commonwealth;
but
the
gross
premiums
would
be
taxed
in
year
one,
assuming
this
policy
was
taken
out
in
1976.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
your
honor,
it
is,
not
on
a
per
se
basis;
but
the
load
in
any
given
year,
the
commission
could
be
greater
than
the
load
or
less
than
the
load.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that;
but
i
can
tell
you
that
a
small
company
trying
to
put
much
business
on
the
books
may
pay
more
than
the
first
year
premium
in
commission,
whereas
a
more
established
company
which
readily
has
agents
available
to
it
and
has
a
better
sales
mechanism
will
not
pay
anything
like
that.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice,
but
it
could
be
higher
than
that.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
yes,
indeed,
and
that
is
why
that
818(c)
in
that
level
election
might
be
made,
so
they
can
take
your
tax
deductions
on
a
different
basis.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
there
is
no
net
income
for
annual-statement
purposes;
there
is
net
income
under
the
government’s
position.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
that
is
right.
