now,
does
that
depend
on
state
law,

do
most
states
impose
minimum
requirements
to
those?
justice
william

rehnquist
well,
mr.
hughes,
wouldn't
you
concede
that
there
is
at
least
a
superficial
plausibility
to
the
governmentâ€™s
approach
that
if
a
figure
goes
into
the
numerator,
it
ought
to
go
into
the
denominator,
too?
