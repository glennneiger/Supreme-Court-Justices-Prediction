justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smith,
let
me
just
ask
you
a
question
about
uncollected
premium.
if
the
premium
has
been
uncollected
for,
say,
45
days
--
there
is
a
normal
30-day
period
in
which
you
can
pay
--
is
it
still
classed
as
an
uncollected
premium,
or
are
we
only
talking
about
on
the
year-end
business
those
that
were
due
as
of
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
one
month.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smith,
is
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
powell
entirely
correct?
i
understood
you
say
that
when
the
reserve
is
set
up
on
a
deferred
or
uncollected
premium,
nothing
is
set
aside.
now,
of
course,
that
is
true
in
the
sense
that
the
premium
itself
has
not
been
collected;
but
there
must
be
an
offsetting
asset
on
the
balance
sheet,
must
there
not
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
suppose
if
a
policyholder
dies,
real
assets
will
have
to
be
used
to
pay
the
claim,
won't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
a
sense
they
are
an
overstatement,
because
the
premium
has
not
been
paid;
but
as
of
the
december
31st
date,
aren't
they
an
accurate
statement
of
the
contingent
liability
that
the
company
has
on
outstanding
policies?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
can
use
the
term
in
two
senses,
i
suppose:
one,
it
is
a
measure
of
how
much
has
been
collected
in
the
way
of
net
valuation
portion
of
premiums;
and
secondly
you
can
use
it
as
a
measure
of
the
contingent
liability
on
policies
which
are
in
force;
and
it
is
an
accurate
statement
of
the
latter,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
die
on
the
date
the
statement
is
prepared,
it
is
a
real
liability
to
that
extent,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
because
the
risk
includes
the
risk
of
death
during
the
ensuing
six
months
or
so.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
exactly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smith,
do
i
correctly
understand
that
this
original
decision
by
the
industry,
then,
was
to
include
the
net
valuation
portion
of
the
premium
on
the
asset
side?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
they
took
the
position
that
the
industry
now
takes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
was
not
trying
to
get
to
the
merits;
but
i
am
correct,
am
i
not,
that
currently
the
industry
position
has
been
consistent
for
about
a
hundred
years,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smith,
just
let
me
throw
a
thought
out
and
be
sure
you
address
it
in
due
course.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
smith,
my
question
really
related
to
how
much
of
the
loading
would
the
governmentâ€™s
position
include
in
income
on
that
assumption?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
do
you
do
about
the
seventh
circuit
case
--
i
take
it
you
still
disagree
with
the
position
of
the
seventh
circuit
in
its
most
recent
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
it
will
have
to
be
reached
before
the
litigation
terminates;
won't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
it
have
to
be
resolved
in
this
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
somebody
is
going
to
have
to
enter
judgment
for
some
amount
of
dollars;
aren't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
correct
in
all
events
that
what
we
are
really
talking
about
here
is
the
year
in
which
the
tax
will
be
paid
on
these
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
it
is
advantageous
to
the
taxpayer
to
postpone
it,
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
hughes,
on
that
assumption,
wouldn't
the
$75,000
premium
be
deducted
from
the
payoff,
and
therefore
you
would
have
received
income?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
government
prevailed
in
foster
lumber;
didn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smith,
i
just
ask
this
very
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
land
right
into
the
naic
under
his
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
do
not,
well,
that
is
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
one
ever
land
in
the
"except"
sentence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
tax
case,
we
decide
how
a
life
insurance
company
should
account
for
unpaid
premiums
in
computing
its
federal
income
taxes.
an
unpaid
premium
is
an
installment
which
is
payable
within
the
policy
year,
but
has
not
been
paid
at
the
end
of
the
calendar
year.
thus,
for
example,
if
a
policy
is
written
on
may
1,
1976,
an
installment
due
on
february
1,
1977
would
be
an
unpaid
premium
on
december
31,
1976.
if
such
a
premium
is
not
paid
in
due
course,
the
policy
will
lapse
but
the
company
has
no
legal
right
to
collect
its
unpaid
premiums.
for
that
reason,
they
are
not
typical
accounts
receivable
and
would
not
be
accrued
under
normal
accounting
principles.
the
life
insurance
industry
however,
is
subject
to
extensive
state
regulation
which
uniformly
requires
the
companies
to
compute
their
reserves
as
though
these
unpaid
premiums
had
in
fact
been
paid.
in
general,
the
addition
to
the
reserves
is
equal
to
the
net
valuation
portion
of
the
unpaid
premium.
that
is
to
say
the
portion
of
the
premium
that
state
law
requires
to
be
set
aside
in
order
to
enable
the
company
to
meet
its
policy
obligation.
the
so-called
loading
portion
of
the
premium,
which
is
the
part
of
the
premium
that
covers
company
expenses
and
profit
if
any,
is
not
added
to
its
reserves.
it
is
the
government's
primary
position
that
the
loading
portion
of
unpaid
premiums
should
also
be
treated
as
through
it
had
been
paid.
such
treatment
would
increase
the
income
tax
liability
of
the
companies.
on
the
other
hand,
the
company
in
this
case
takes
the
position
that
the
net
valuation
portion
of
the
unpaid
premium
should
be
treated
as
though
paid
for
the
purpose
of
calculating
its
reserves,
but
should
be
ignored
when
it
is
calculating
its
assets
and
gross
premium
income.
that
approach,
which
was
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
tends
to
decrease
the
company's
tax
liability.
we
reject
both
of
these
positions
and
hold
that
the
net
valuation
portion
of
the
premium
should
be
treated
as
paid
in
calculating
reserves,
assets
and
gross
premium
income,
and
that
the
loading
portion
should
be
excluded
from
all
these
calculations.
this
is
the
accounting
procedure
followed
since
1871
by
an
official
organization
responsible
for
auditing
insurance
companies
on
behalf
of
various
state
regulatory
agencies.
congress
has
directed
the
companies
to
follow
that
organization's
approach
in
various
situations
and
we
read
that
statutory
direction
as
controlling
in
this
case.
we
accordingly
reverse
the
contrary
judgement
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
mr.
justice
white,
with
whom
the
chief
justice
has
joined,
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
dissenting
from
our
analysis
but
agreeing
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
must
be
set
aside.
mr.
justice
stewart
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
