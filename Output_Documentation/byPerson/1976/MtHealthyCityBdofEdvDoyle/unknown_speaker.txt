unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
question
there
if
i
may
mr.
olinger
and
i
will
try
to
be
parochial,
but
i
am
used
to
the
arizona
organization
of
school,
first
let
me
give
you
that
and
ask
you
if
it
is
like
ohio.
where
i
practice
in
arizona,
there
was
a
municipal
corporation
which
was
called
a
school
district
and
it
was
very
much
analogous
to
counties
or
cities
and
things
like
that.
then
the
board
that
administered
that
district
was
called
the
school
board
it
was
not
a
sueable
entity
in
itself,
it
was
just
a
collection
of
individuals.
now
what
is
the
situation
in
ohio?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
difference
between
the
school
district
and
the
board
of
education?
unknown
speaker
and
both
are
regarded
as
municipal
corporations?
unknown
speaker
or
a
board
of
education?
unknown
speaker
the
cincinnati
board
of
education
would
be
the
defendant
in
the
suit
against
the
school
district
would
it
not,
probably?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
i
have
a
contract
claim
against
the
school
district
and
name
the
proper
parties,
out
of
whose
treasury
does
that
judgment
pay?
unknown
speaker
of
what?
unknown
speaker
is
the
geographic.
unknown
speaker
so
they
are
really
just
almost
synonymous
for
purposes
of
--
unknown
speaker
does
the
constitution
of
ohio
provide
for
school
boards
or
school
boards
of
education
as
i
think
you
call
them?
unknown
speaker
school
board
members
in
virginia
are
constitutional
officers,
is
that
true
in
ohio?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
want
to
detain
you
on
the
point,
i
was
just
interested.
your
school
boards
do
have
authority
to
levy
taxes,
or
do
they?
unknown
speaker
who
levies,
the
county,
the
city?
unknown
speaker
that
is,
the
voters
are
all
the
people
in
the
school
district?
unknown
speaker
but
could
you
defer
from
the
county
or
the
city
or
anything
else?
unknown
speaker
boundary
wise.
unknown
speaker
and
how
about
bond
issues?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
authority
to
issue
bonds
up
to
limitation
analogous
to
the
ten-mill
limitation
without
the
vote
of
the
people?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
want
to
detain
you
on
this
particular
subject,
but
while
we
are
on
it,
does
the
record
show
or
do
you
know
as
a
matter
of
public
record,
what
percentage
of
the
cost
of
operating
the
public
schools
in
ohio
is
borne
by
the
state
treasury?
in
rodriquez
that
was
before
this
court
a
few
years
ago
i
think
they
have
not
showed
the
example
that
some
45%
came
from
state
funds,
this
maybe
relevant
to
the
eleventh
amendment
issue
in
your
case
by
a
sequence.
unknown
speaker
are
they
matters
of
public
record.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
are
they?
unknown
speaker
that
is
an
equalizing
fund.
unknown
speaker
mr.
olinger,
the
first
question
presented
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
is
whether
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
of
this
action
under
section
1331,
are
you
planning
to
discuss
this
in
your…
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
mean
to
order
your
argument
for
you,
i
just
wanted
to
know
if
you
did
plan
that.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
mr.
doyle
had
no
legal
advice
when
he
stated
the
reasons,
did
he?
unknown
speaker
yes,
superintendent.
unknown
speaker
and
really
logically
that
is
your
first
argument?
unknown
speaker
if
you
are
right
about
that
we
never
get
to
that
matter,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
1331.
unknown
speaker
mr.
olinger,
as
you
get
into
that,
may
i
ask
you
this.
do
you
conceive
that
if
a
bona
fide
claim
of
$10,000
or
more
as
presented
by
this
case
that
there
is
federal
jurisdiction
against
this
defendant?
unknown
speaker
under
1331?
unknown
speaker
it
was
not
clear
to
me.
it
is
a
little
more
clear,
i
think
from
your
supplemental
brief.
unknown
speaker
that
even
if
there
is
1331
federal
jurisdiction,
nonetheless
your
client
is
not
a
person
under
1983?
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
olinger
is
it
not
that
true
that
under
ohio
statutory
law,
if
he
had
been
rehired,
he
would
then
have
had
tenure
for
the
rest
of
his
life
subject
to
being
terminated
for
cause.
unknown
speaker
so,
that
is
the
$10,000
a
year
for
the
rest
of
his
working
life,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
discounted
and
then
mitigated
by
any
other
employment
he
might
have
had,
so
that
certainly
on
its
face
looks
like
more
than
$10,000,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
you
will
need
one
$10,000.
unknown
speaker
you
need
one
$10,000
in
one
sentence.
unknown
speaker
that
is
all
it
means.
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
kind
of
a
computation
that
a
jury
is
asked
to
make
in
every
negligence
case,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
still,
the
total
still
comes
out
to
(voice
overlap).
unknown
speaker
of
course,
ordinarily
for
ascertaining
the
substantiality
of
the
jurisdictional
model,
you
do
not
try
the
damages
issue
and
argue
all
of
the
pros
and
cons,
it
is
just
kind
of
the
idea,
is
it
a
coverable
claim,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
is
it
a
bona
fide
coverable
claim,
that
is
the
general….
unknown
speaker
there
are
just
some
trumped
off
really
to
get
you
into
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
little
late
to
take
it
out.
unknown
speaker
it
used
to
be
3,000.
unknown
speaker
it
may
not
have
been
a
very
effective
limitation
but
certainly
that
is
the
way
this
court
and
another
courts
have
read
as
being
just
is
it
in
good
faith
more
or
less.
unknown
speaker
it
is
effective
when
you
are
talking
about
a
liquidated
claim
or
on
a
contract
action
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
assume,
he
is
talking
about
he
want
to
keep
the
job
that
he
has
and
i
think
he
is
talking
about
not
being
put
out
of
that
job.
i
think
it
is
a
whole
lot
than
just
dissents.
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
is
right
on
the
merits,
and
therefore,
the
allegations
of
his
complaint
are
sufficient,
then
if
rehired,
his
claim
is
that
he
should
have
been
rehired
then
he
would
have
had
tenure
under
ohio
law,
would
he
not?
unknown
speaker
when
will
he
get
tenure
the
new
--
unknown
speaker
in
the
new
job,
miami
trace
job.
unknown
speaker
after
three?
unknown
speaker
now,
he
has
no
problem
there,
according
to
you.
unknown
speaker
he
does
not
have
any
problems
there,
that
is
your
position?
unknown
speaker
because
your
more
basic
claim,
jurisdictional
claim
is
now
as
i
understand
it,
that
even
assuming
that
the
amount
in
controversy
exceeds
$!0,000
exclusive
of
interests
and
costs
and
that
therefore
is
federal
jurisdiction
under
section
1331,
nonetheless
your
client
is
immune
by
reason
of
1983.
unknown
speaker
but
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
your
client
is
immune
under
1983,
a
suggestion
has
made
by
our
opponents
that
a
course
of
action
may
lie
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
enforce
first
amendment
rights
without
regard
to
1983.
do
you
respond
to
that?
unknown
speaker
you
have
a
lot
of
complaint
there.
unknown
speaker
and
that
legislation
could
or
might
not
waive
sovereign
immunity,
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
and
that
1983
is
such
legislation
and
it
imposed
limits
i.e.
that
your
client
is
not
a
person?
unknown
speaker
1331
would
also
provide
a
jurisdiction
in
a
1983
action
if
more
than
$10,000
were
involved
exclusive
of
interests
and
costs,
is
it
not
correct?
unknown
speaker
but
it
would
have
been
perfectly
adequate
jurisdictional
statute
upon
which
to
rely.
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
get
this
cause
of
action
directly
in
the
fourteenth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
is
like
ex
parte
young
basis,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
safe
assumption
ever
as
a
jurisdiction
remain
in
a
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gottesman,
did
you
cite
1331
on
your
complaint?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
want
to
know
because
that
is
the
only
reference
i
find
as
1931.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
a
pleading
point
basically
mr.
gottesman
that
you
do
not
have
to
plead
jurisdiction,
if
it
is
apparent
from
the
facts?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
the
quite
the
same
thing
i
was
saying
that
parties
dismissed
and
is
against
whom
the
dismissal
has
become
final
can
be
reinstated
after
that
point.
unknown
speaker
there
you
do
not
have
the
res
judicata
problem.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
gottesman,
if
we
allow
the
remand,
you
really
would
not
have
to
amend
your
complaint.
the
complaint
is
perfectly
alright.
unknown
speaker
what
we
would
have
to
be
doing
is
remanding
to
let
you
take
an
appeal
you
did
not
take.
unknown
speaker
why
petitioner
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
this,
mr.
gottesman?
you
could
not
get
an
order
even
though
you
do
not
have
the
officials,
a
reinstatement
against
the
school
board
itself?
unknown
speaker
even
for
injunctive
relief?
unknown
speaker
if
you
would
equate
the
school
board
with
a
municipality.
unknown
speaker
that
is
kenosha
holds
that
you
cannot
get
injunctive
relief
against
them
under
1983.
unknown
speaker
it
cannot
get
any
relief.
unknown
speaker
it
is
immune
from
liability
under
1983.
unknown
speaker
that
does
basically
confer
a
cause
of
action
against
the
municipality.
unknown
speaker
does
not
fit
out
of
the
word
'person'.
unknown
speaker
well
mr.
gottesman
in
the
page
14
(a)
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
in
paragraph
9
the
district
court
said
that
this
court
does
not
state
any
conclusion
on
the
possible
monroe
kenosha
problem
in
this
case.
it
seems
that
this
case,
we
properly
hear
as
a
1331
case,
as
well
as
an
1983
case,
and
you
think
that
is
fair
enough
that
they
did
not
reach
the
1983.
unknown
speaker
the
only
decision
has
been
1331.
unknown
speaker
isn’t
the
district
court
mixing
apples
and
oranges
in
that
paragraph
9,
to
which
my
brother
white
has
just
referred
because
a
1331
is
a
jurisdictional
statute
and
1983
is
a
substantive.
unknown
speaker
i
would
also
assumes
that
1983
is
separate
from,
has
no
connect
with
1331
and
i
think
you
got
to
reach
that
right
now.
unknown
speaker
it
contrasted
too.
unknown
speaker
directly
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
not
under
the
fourteenth.
unknown
speaker
against
federal.
unknown
speaker
and
there
is
no
federal
analog
of
1983.
unknown
speaker
it
was
implied
by
the
court,
was
it
not
in
bivens?
unknown
speaker
it
was
not
quite
even
though
congress
had
enacted
no
statute,
it
was
when
congress
has
enacted
no
statute.
unknown
speaker
it
did
not
imply
that
congress,
if
it
did
enact
a
statute
could
not
have
put
limitations
on
it.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
afforded
by.
unknown
speaker
well
how
do
you
explain
bell
versus
hoods
reservation
of
the
point
ultimately
decided
in
bivens
if
it
is
that
clear?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gottesman,
let
me
just
interrupt
you
again.
did
you
in
your
complaint
identify
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
the
basis
for
legal
recovery?
i
do
not
find
any
in
your
complaint.
unknown
speaker
oh!
i
see,
in
paragraph
10
you
have,
i
apologize,
it
is
there.
unknown
speaker
your
position
then
would
be
and
perhaps
it
is
right,
is
that
a
plaintiff,
even
though
in
fact
you
cannot
sue
a
municipal
corporation
under
1331
because
1983
places
limitations
on
it
and
you
have
to
--
that
is
the
only
way
you
can
get
into
court
because
of
that
even
though
1331
is
on
the
books.
you
would
say
that
if
the
plaintiff
says
i
have
a
claim
under
1983
that
and
nothing
is
raised
about
jurisdiction,
the
rest
of
it
is
a
merits
question.
unknown
speaker
however,
if
you
are
wrong,
and
it
is
in
fact
a
jurisdictional
question
rather
than
a
merits
question,
then
i
take
it
to
the
other
view
it
prevails.
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
ask
one
other
question
on
the
person
issue.
do
you
agree
that
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
school
board
is
a
person
is
a
jurisdictional
issue?
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
wondering
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
because
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
anybody
really
addressed
themselves
to
the
problem
in
the
district
court,
even
in
the
pleadings.
unknown
speaker
but
of
course
if
there
is
jurisdictional
issue
then
it
was
the
plaintiff’s
job
to
push
them,
brief
them
and
make
a
record
of.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
defendant
never
disputes
the
existence
of
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
the
court
is
always
free
and
so
it
becomes
very
important
whether
or
not
this
is
a
jurisdictional
question
or
a
merits
question.
unknown
speaker
when
was
eleventh
amendment
issue
raised?
unknown
speaker
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
it
has
never
really
been
addressed
by
any
courts
below?
unknown
speaker
but
it
just
that
it
was
not
raised.
unknown
speaker
back
to
that,
it
is
the
same
paragraph
9.
unknown
speaker
but
then
it
was
never
really
discussed
by
any
court?
unknown
speaker
of
course
you
know
from
the
ford
motor
company
that
can
be
raised
on
appeal.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
edelman
relied
on
ford
motor
company’s…
unknown
speaker
you
are
under
a
fair
warning
on
that
in
a
district
court,
i
think?
unknown
speaker
i,
for
one,
would
be
interested
and
up
to
you
if
you
like
to
spend
your
brief
remaining
moments
in
discussing
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
misconduct
in
the
lunch
room
cafeteria?
unknown
speaker
now,
you
say
too,
that
one
was
that
telephone
call…
unknown
speaker
the
obscene
gesture
to
the
students.
unknown
speaker
so
you
conceive
that
one
was
a
proper
foundation
and
submit
that
the
other
was
not.
unknown
speaker
is
not
that
second
ground
something
broader
than
just
a
single
episode,
is
it
not?
it
is
a
broad
question
of
his
lack
of
maturity.
unknown
speaker
and
there
i
have
perhaps
a
dozen
elements
under
that…
unknown
speaker
in
which
at
least
they
which
one
is
out,
in
your
submission.
unknown
speaker
but
that
assumes
about
the
improper
reliance.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
have
to
assume
it
was
improper.
unknown
speaker
that
the
first
question…
unknown
speaker
well,
it
has
to
be
that
you
may
not
even
rely
on
the
phone
call
that
is
your
lack
of
tact.
unknown
speaker
because
that
is
projected
first
amendment
activity.
unknown
speaker
and
before
you
sit
down,
just
let
me
ask
you
this
that
would
it
not
be
true
that
however
we
decided
to
this
case.
so
far
as
future
conduct
when
future
behavior
on
the
part
of
school
boards
around
the
country
would
be
almost
meaningless
or
else
they
would
put
them
in
terribly
bad
trap
because
let
us
assume
in
that
if
we
decide
the
case
in
your
favor,
thereafter
would
it
not
be
true
that
any
incompetent
teacher
who
knew
that
because
of
his
incompetence
or
misconduct
or
bad
behavior
he
was
not
going
to
be
rehired
could
simply
go
out
and
make
a
speech,
a
very
insulting
speech
against
the
school
board
and
if
that
or
any
part
of
their
decision
not
to
rehire
him,
then
he
would
have
to
be
rehired
despite
his
misconduct
and
incompetence
on
the
one
hand,
and
would
it
not
mean
on
the
other
hand
that
if
we
decide
it
in
your
favor
that
any
school
board
that
could
