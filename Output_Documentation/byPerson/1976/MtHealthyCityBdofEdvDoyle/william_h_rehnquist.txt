justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
case,
responded
was
an
untenured
teacher
and
an
employee
of
the
mt.
healthy
board
of
education,
the
petitioner.
the
respondent
filed
this
action
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
souther
district
of
ohio
and
complained
that
the
board's
failure
to
renew
his
employment
contract
was
in
violation
of
his
rights
under
the
united
states
constitution
because
that
decision
had
been
motivated
by
the
board's
disapproval
of
certain
actions
protected
against
state
interference
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
the
district
court
found
that
it
had
jurisdiction
under
the
general
federal
questions
section,
28
usc
1331
and
ruled
that
though
a
number
of
other
incidents
have
been
considered
by
the
board,
the
teacher
was
entitled
to
reinstatement
with
back
pay
because
the
first
amendment
protected
conduct
have
been
a
substantial
factor
and
the
words
of
the
court
and
it's
decision
not
to
rehire.
this
judgment
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
for
the
reason
set
forth
and
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
we
conclude
that
respondent
did
state
a
cause
of
action
adequate
to
his
established
jurisdiction
under
section
1331.
but
because
the
issue
wasn't
preserved
on
appeal,
we
express
no
view
on
the
actual
merits
of
either
the
theory
apparently
accepted
by
the
courts
below
that
responded
had
an
implied
constitutional
cause
of
action
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments,
or
the
theory
not
to
specifically
addressed
by
those
courts
that
he
have
an
action
under
section
1983.
accepting
without
deciding
that
respondent's
complaint
states
a
good
cause
of
action,
we
call
--
we
hold
that
the
case
must
be
returned
to
the
lower
courts
for
additional
findings.
the
finding
that
the
first
amendment
protected
conduct
was
a
substantial
or
motivating
factor
in
a
decision
not
to
rehire
does
not
necessarily
imply
that
the
teacher
would
have
necessarily
been
rehired
that
the
impermissible
factor
had
not
been
considered
because
the
first
amendment
does
not
require
that
employee
should
be
put
in
a
more
favorable
position
bu
virtue
of
their
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.
we
vacate
and
remand
for
determination
by
the
lower
courts
of
the
question
whether
the
board
would
have
decline
to
rehire
the
teacher
quite
apart
from
the
protected
conduct.
