mr.
philip
s.
olinger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
mt.
healthy
school
district
is
a
small
school
district
on
the
outskirts
of
cincinnati.
it
has
approximately,
7600
students
and
approximately
325
teachers.
in
1966,
the
board
of
education
employed
fred
doyle,
the
respondent
in
this
case.
he
was
employed
on
three
one-year
contracts
and
then
he
was
given
a
two-year
contract.
all
of
these
contracts
were
nontenure.
in
1971,
in
the
spring
of
that
year,
the
board,
as
was
its
usual
custom,
reviewed
the
contracts
of
the
nontenured
teachers,
and
determined
that
year,
that
ten
of
them
should
not
be
renewed.
mr.
doyle
happened
to
be
one
of
those
teachers
whose
contract
was
not
renewed.
he
requested
a
reason
following
his
notice
that
he
was
not
renewed
and
the
superintendent
sent
him
a
letter
and
in
that
letter
the
superintendent
stated,
that
“he
was
not
renewed
because
it
was
felt
he
lacked
tact
in
handling
professional
matters”
and
the
superintendent
went
on
to
cite
two
examples.
one
was
a
telephone
call
that
mr.
doyle
had
made
to
a
local
disc
jockey
at
a
radio
station
to
criticize
a
dress
code
that
had
been
sent
around
to
the
teachers
and
the
second
example
cited
by
the
superintendent
was
an
obscene
gesture
that
mr.
doyle
had
made
to
some
female
students
in
the
school.
after
mr.
doyle
was
aware
that
he
was
not
going
to
be
renewed
in
mt.
healthy,
he
sought
employment
elsewhere.
in
fact
in
june
of
1971,
obtained
a
job
at
the
miami
trace
local
school
district,
which
is
50
miles
or
so
north
of
mt.
healthy.
one
month
later
in
july,
he
filed
this
suit
along
with
two
other
school
teachers
and
he
filed
the
suit
against
the
five
board
members
in
their
individual
and
official
capacity,
he
filed
it
against
the
board
itself
as
a
political
entity
of
a
state,
and
he
filed
it
against
the
superintendent.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
in
ohio,
your
honor,
there
are
different
types
of
school
districts,
but
the
particular
district
we
are
discussing
here
is
a,
what
is
known
as
a
city
school
district
and
basically
it
encompasses
the
district
or
the
same
boundary
lines
as
the
municipality
of
mt.
healthy.
now,
however,
in
ohio
school
districts
that
are
city
school
districts
do
not
have
to
be
confined
to
that
precise
municipal
boundary,
and
i
think
you
will
find
for
example
with
the
mt.
healthy
school
district
it
encompassed
a
larger
amount
of
territory
than
the
city
itself,
part
of
a
township,
and
the
same
would
be
true
for
example
with
the
board
of
education
for
the
city
of
cincinnati
which
encompasses
the
city
of
cincinnati.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
oh!
alright,
i
am
not
sure
i
know
there
is
a
difference
in
ohio.
i
think
for
all
intents
and
purposes
they
have
been
treated
as
synonymous.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
no,
i
have
never
heard
a
school
district
referred
to
as
a
municipal
corporation.
it
has
always
been
refereed
to
as
a
school
district.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
or
a
board
of
education,
either
one.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
yes,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
that
judgment
would
be
paid
out
of
general
fund.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
of
the
school
district
or
the
board
of
education
whichever
prefer.
as
i
understand
it
in
ohio,
your
honor,
a
school
district
is
a…
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
is
the
geographic
area.
for
example
in
this
complaint,
the
respondent
here
in
the
initial
lawsuit
sued
the
mt.
healthy
city
school
district
board
of
education.
now
in
the
statute,
it
says,
“that
a
board
of
education
shall
be
a
body
politic,
capable
of
suing
and
being
sued.”
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
as
i
understand
it,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
the
constitution
of
ohio
provides
that
there
shall
be
a
school
system
provided
for,
in
ohio.
i
cannot
recall
the
exact
terms,
your
honor,
and
i
do
not…
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
they
are.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
in
ohio,
your
honor,
there
is
what
is
known
in
ohio
is
a
ten-mill
limitation
and
that
ten-mill
limitation
must
be
shared.
in
this,
let
us
say
in
this
particular
case
between
the
municipality
and
that
would
be
the
city
of
mt.
healthy
shared
with
the
county
of
hamilton
in
which
the
city
resides
and
also
must
then
be
shared
with
the
board
of
education
so
that
is
ten-mill.
now,
those
ten-mills
can
be
levied
without
the
vote
of
the
people,
but
once
you
reach
that
ten-mill
limitation
than
the
only
way
you
can
then
get
a
tax
levy
is
by
submitting
the
matter
to
the
public
and
i
might
say
that
in
mt.
healthy,
in
the
past
six
years
we
have
had
five
tax
levies
they
have
all
failed,
and
most
recent
one
was
yesterday
and
we
do
not
know
the
result
of
that
yet.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
no,
the
school
board
itself
your
honor.
school
board
itself
adapts
a
resolution
to
put
a
tax
levy
on
the
ballot
and
if
it
is
passed,
we
can
then
have
the…
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
in
the
school
district,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
it
could
be.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
yes,
boundary
wise
only
the
voters
who
are
in
the
school
district
may
vote
on
that
particular
issue.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
same
thing
is
true.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
your
honor,
i
am
not
sure,
but
i
think
that
on
bonds
you
have
to
submit
all
bond
issues
to
the
general
elector.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
your
honor,
there
was
no
testimony
present
on
that
issue
in
the
trial.
i
do
have
the
figures
and
they
are…
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
yes.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
in
the
1971-72
school
year
the
state
of
ohio
contributed
48%.
in
1972-73
the
state
contributed
51%,
in
1973-74
they
contributed
50%,
in
74-75
they
contributed
53%
and
in
75-76
it
also
contributed
53%.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
yes
under
the
equal
yield
formula.
i
might
say
one
another
thing,
your
honor,
these
percentages
of
state
contribution
would
have
been
higher
except
that
in
ohio,
the
state
of
ohio
was
finding
itself
in
a
very
financially
embarrassed
position
and
has
reduced
the
amount
of
equal
yield
of
all
the
school
districts
in
ohio.
after
conclusion
of
the
trial,
the
district
court
dismissed
the
board
members
and
the
superintendent
and
found
that
the
board
was
guilty
and
should
pay
to
mr.
doyle
something
over
$5000
in
wages,
should
pay
something
over
$6000
attorney
fees,
assessed
costs
against
the
board
and
ordered
mr.
doyle
to
be
reinstated
in
the
mt.
healthy
school
system
on
a
tenured
contract.
on
appeal,
the
only
thing
that
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
was
to
reverse
the
district
court
in
so
for
as
attorney
fees
on
the
basis
of
the
alyeska
versus
wilderness
society
holding
that
attorney
fees
are
basically
cost.
the
evidence,
i
think
establishes
beyond
doubt
that
mr.
doyle’s
contract
was
not
be
renewed
because
the
board
members
felt
that
he
simply
lack
the
tact
or
for
an
use
of
another
word,
maturity
to
be
given
a
tenured
contract
in
the
board
of
education.
the
court
in
its
opinion
cites
five
examples,
if
you
will,
of
mr.
doyle’s
immaturity
and
as
one
board
member
said
over
the
five
years,
there
appeared
to
be
no
improvement
in
his
maturity
or
lack
of
tact
problem.
now,
in
fact,
i
think
perhaps
the
most
important
thing
that
i
can
find
in
the
judge’s
opinion
was
when
he
states,
“in
fact",
as
this
court
sees
that
and
finds
both
the
board
and
the
superintendent
basically
had
ample
reason
not
to
grant
mr.
doyle
a
tenured
contract
without
regard
to
the
first
amendment
problem.
the
court
also
pointed
out
that
four
board
members
and
the
superintendent
stated
without
any
denial
or
rebuttal
that
they
did
not
determine
not
to
renew
mr.
doyle’s
contract
because
of
a
free
speech
problem.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
yes
i
am
your
honor,
in
fact
i
am…
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
oh!
yes
i
did,
your
honor.
i
may
not
have
very
much
time,
but
i
do
want
to
discuss
every
point
that
i
have
brought
up.
the
first
point
that
i
want
to,
the
first
proposition
of
law
that
i
would
like
to
present
to
the
court
is
that
i
do
not
really
have
any
question
if
a
court
wishes
to
accept
the
substantiality
doctrine
for
the
problem
that
is
here
today.
that
is,
we
have
a
situation,
where
obviously
there
were
a
number
of
permissible
reasons
for
the
board
could
have
not
—
could
have
used
for
not
granting
tenure
and
then
we
have
this
one
non-permissible
reason.
there
is
some
argument,
alright,
the
board
did
not
consider
that,
but
i
am
going
to
treat
the
matter
as
though
the
board
and
which
they
did,
they
were
certainly
well
aware
of
the
wsai
phone
call.
my
position
is
that
i
think
as
judge
hogan
who
i
an
very
fond
of,
looked
at
the
case,
he
saw
that
the
board
had
valid
reasons
not
to
renew
the
contract,
but
he
saw
the
telephone
call
to
wsai
and
he
felt
under
pickering
and
as
he
cites
ski
him
that
he
had
no
choice,
but
since
there
was
a
first
amendment
problem
in
there
that
he
had
to
rule
against
the
board.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
you
mean
the
superintendent,
your
honor?
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
i
did
not
represent
the
board
at
that
time
and
they
had
another
attorney
but
he
died
and
i
do
not
know
whether
he
was
alive
or
not
at
that
particular
time.
i
cannot
advise
this
court
on
that
particular
problem,
your
honor.
there
is
one
other
thought
i
would
like
to
advance
on
that
first
theory
and
that
is
maybe
it
is
similar
to
a
reviewing
court,
who
will
not
set
aside
a
trial
court,
even
if
the
trial
court
decides
a
case
for
the
wrong
reasons
but
comes
to
the
right
result
and
then
my
final
theory
is
that
i
think
under
what
i
am
starting
to
understand
is
the
doctrine
of
federalism
or
commenting
between
the
federal
system
and
the
state
system
that
the
matter
of
education
is
primarily
a
state
concern,
and
therefore,
should
be
left
to
the
state
to
handle
its
own
affairs.
now,
my
second
argument
of
course
involves
jurisdiction.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
yes,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
yeah,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
the
first
argument
involves
jurisdiction.
mr.
doyle
brought
his
suit
under
course
1983
which
then
brings
into
play
1343
and
1341.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
1331.
in
the
first
proposition,
in
my
brief,
i
say
that
under
monroe
versus
pape,
city
of
kenosha
versus
bruno,
moor
versus
county
of
alameda
and
this
summer,
i
believe,
the
case
of
aldinger
v.
howard
that
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
a
municipality
and
a
county
are
not
a
person
under
1983
and
consequently
the
federal
courts
have
no
jurisdiction
either
for
legal,
that
is
damages
or
equitable
relief.
i
am
asking
this
court
today
to
extend
that
doctrine
to
boards
of
education.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
if
i
recall
correctly,
we
were
discussing
the
1983
issue
in
my
brief
and
i
am
not
going
to
spend
any
more
time
on
it.
i
believe
that
there
is
a
valid
reason
to
take
the
position
that
boards
of
education
are
entitled
to
the
same
immunity
that
has
been
granted
to
both
municipalities
and
counties
in
this
particular
area.
i
would
like
to
move
on
now
to
the
1331
argument.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
no.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
no,
your
honor.
i
think
…
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
alright,
when
the
brief
was
first
prepared,
when
i
prepared
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari.
i
was
under
the
impression
that
that
was
the
only
issue
left,
with
1331
and
the
$10,000
amount.
the
respondent’s
brief
brought
up
the
subject
in
his
brief
and
later
after
further
research
and
looking
at
bivens
versus
the
six
unknown
federal
narcotics
agents
and
aldinger
versus
howard,
i
have
to
reverse
myself
and
saying
no,
i
do
not
think
that
resolves
the
issue.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
that
is
correct.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
yes,
your
honor.
now,
respondent
says,
well,
this
court
has
sua
sponte
jurisdiction,
on
its
own
sua
sponte
may
raise
a
jurisdictional
question.
the
respondent
takes
the
possession
that
that
is
not
a
jurisdictional
question
and
that
is
the
only
point
i
disagree
with.
i
did
not
bring
this
subject
up
in
my
original
brief.
i
apologize
for
not
being
astute
enough
to
recognize
that
as
an
issue
at
that
particular
time,
but
anyway,
going
to
1331
and
the
$10,000
issue.
at
the
time
that
mr.
doyle
filed
this
lawsuit,
he
of
course
had
obtained
employment
elsewhere
and
just
for
argument
purposes
that
salary
was
approximately
$2,000
less
than
the
salary
that
he
would
have
received
at
mt.
healthy.
if
i
understand
what
the
federal
courts
are
saying
is
that
when
an
employment
question
is
involved,
it
is
the
salary
of
that
particular
job
that
establishes
the
$10,000
jurisdiction.
well,
i
am
not
sure
exactly
what
the
court
means
by
that,
but
if
you
are
taking
one
year
salary,
the
salary
of
mt.
healthy
would
have
been
a
little
bit
more
than
$10,000
then
under
columbia
insurance
company
versus
wheelwright
i
suppose
that
this
court
would
say,
well,
that
there
was
federal
jurisdiction
on
the
$10,000
issue,
but
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
if
that
is
going
to
be
the
basis,
if
at
the
time
he
files
the
lawsuit,
he
has
got
another
position
paying
out
$8,000.
the
only
distinction
is
really
the
$2,000
between
the
two
salaries.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
that
is
correct.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
that
is
correct.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
well,
now
if
you
want
to
say
he
had
$10,000
for
the
rest
of
his
life
then
i
suppose
you
get
into
the
question,
well,
how
long
is
the
employee
entitled
to
claim
this
$10,000?
is
it
$10,000
times
the
mortality
rate
for
the
rest
of
his
life?
in
other
words…
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
well,
i
know.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
yes
i
agree,
but
what
i
am
pointing
out
is
that
if
we
are
going
to
establish
jurisdiction
on
the
$10,000
amount
on
that
basis,
then
we
got
to
think
in
terms
of
damages.
now,
if
we
think
in
terms
of
damages,
you
are
going
to
have
to
multiply
$10,000
and
mr.
doyle,
i
say,
was
30
years
of
age,
let
us
say
if
mortality
rate
say
he
is
going
to
live
till
70,
we
have
got
40
more
years
in
there
and
the
federal
district
court
could
assess
a
$400,000
judgment
against
the
mt.
healthy
board
of
education.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
yes
your
honor,
that
is
basically
true.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
i
guess
the
point
i
am
trying
to
say,
your
honor,
is
that
if
you
want
to
take
$10,000
and
multiply
it
over
his
life
expectancy
then
i
think
that
the
employer
should
be
entitled
to
take
$8,000
and
multiply
it
over
his
life
expectancy.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
alright,
except
there
is
one
problem
there
your
honor,
and
that
is
in
educational,
in
computing
salaries,
of
course,
teachers
are
on
steps
etcetera
and
they
reach
a
maximum
point
at
some
level.
now,
we
do
not
know
what
the
miami
trace
maximum
level
is
but
it
could
be
greater
than
mt.
healthy.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
alright
but,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
is
if
it
is
just
a
coverable
claim
then
i
wonder
why
$10,000
is
even
in
the
statute
because…
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
right,
it
used
to
be
3,000,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
yeah,
it
means
something.
here,
i
really
have
problems
trying
to
tell
the
court
what
i
think
is
the
proper
way
to
handle
the
$10,000
jurisdictional
question.
the
only
point
i
am
trying
to
say
is
that
when
mr.
doyle
initially
filed
his
lawsuit,
he
honestly
knew
that
the
only
difference
between
the
job
that
he
was
ever
going
to
claim
trace
in
the
job
at
mt.
healthy,
there
was
a
difference
of
$2,000.
now,
if
we
are
talking
about
--
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
okay,
your
honor,
except
that
he
did
not
--
at
the
time
that
he
filed
suit,
he
did
not
have
a
right
to
that
job.
this
is
not
a
case
whether
we
have
a
tenured
teacher,
your
honor.
i
guess
that
is
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
yes,
he
would;
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
he
already
has
tenure,
your
honor.
tenure
for
mr.
doyle
would
have
occurred
after
three
years.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
right.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
yes
sir.
i
am
sorry
it
is
either
three,
two
or
three
years,
but
he
has
got
tenure
now
at
miami
trace.
he
has
tenure
there.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
you
are
right;
i
am
saying
not
only
does
he
not
have….
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
that
is
correct,
--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
well,
i
am
going
to
try,
your
honor.
i
am
not
going
to
say
i
understand
the
theory
completely,
but…
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
i
am
going
to
give
it
a
try,
and
let
me
start
off
by
saying
that
in
1912,
there
was
a
constitutional
convention
in
ohio,
and
at
that
convention,
they
amended
the
constitution
and
the
constitution
after
the
amendment
read
suits
maybe
brought
against
the
state
in
such
courts
and
in
such
manner
as
maybe
provided
by
law.
after
that
constitutional
amendment
was
passed,
the
issue
immediately
arouse
whether
or
not
the
state
of
ohio
had
abolished
its
sovereign
immunity.
after
numerous
cases,
particularly
involving
municipalities,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
said,
well,
based
on
hans
versus
louisiana,
based
on
cases
in
other
jurisdictions,
we
do
not
think
that
that
provision
of
the
constitution
is
self
executed
that
there
must
be
a
legislation
enacted
to
carry
out
that
permission
that
has
been
granted
by
that
constitutional
amendment.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now,
in
the
case
of
aldrich
versus
the
city
of
youngstown,
which
was
decided
in
1922,
as
i
said,
it
became
clear
that
if
the
sovereign
immunity
of
state
of
ohio
was
to
be
abolished,
it
had
to
be
abolished
by
specific
provision
of
the
legislature.
now,
trying
to
apply
that
theory
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
theory
and
the
first
amendment
theory,
first
of
all
if
i
understand
the
problem,
under
1983,
it
provides
a
remedy
and
a
method
to
carry
out
the
civil
rights
provisions.
now,
the
first
amendment,
as
i
understand
it,
only
provides
that
there
shall
be
no
violation
of
the
right
to
freedom
of
speech,
but
it
does
not
provide
a
remedy
etcetera.
now,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
if
i
understand
correctly,
and
this
is
where
i
maybe
wrong,
the
fourteenth
amendment,
under
section
5,
provides
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
will
be
implemented
or
required
to
be
implemented
by
a
legislation
passed
by
congress.
now,
the
problem
i
have
is,
i
presume
that
that
language
in
this
fourteenth
amendment
has
to
apply
to
the
first
amendment
because
if
i
understand
correctly,
the
first
state
amendments
apply
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
therefore
to
carry
out
the
first
amendment,
there
also
has
to
be
some
sort
of
a
congressional
legislation
in
order
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
that
is
correct
your
honor.
in
other
words,
the
congress
did
speak
to
the
subject
in
the
1983
area
but
because
of
the
sherman
amendment
was
not
adopted,
the
interpretation
in
this
course
has
been
that
it
does
not
then
apply
to
political
entities
of
the
state.
basically
that
concludes
my
argument
and
i
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
philip
s.
olinger
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
