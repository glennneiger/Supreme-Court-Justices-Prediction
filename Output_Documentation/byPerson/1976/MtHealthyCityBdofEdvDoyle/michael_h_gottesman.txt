mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
has
been
said
that
the
jurisdictional
issues
properly
come
first
and
i
will
address
them
first,
but
in
doing
so
i
do
not
want
to
leave
the
impression
that
the
first
amendment
claim
is
to
be
decided
on
the
fact
as
they
have
been
described
today
by
my
colleague,
mr.
olinger.
we
think
the
facts
are
actually
much
more
helpful
to
us
and
i
hope
i
am
going
to
have
time
to
get
to
the
first
amendment
issue
and
talk
about
this
first.
but
first
jurisdiction,
the
complaint
allege
jurisdiction
on
two
separate
statutory
grounds
predicated
on
two
separate
causes
of
action.
first
of
all
it
alleged
that
the
defendant’s
conduct
had
violated
section
1983
and
the
jurisdictional
statute
that
was
then
available
was
1343.
separately,
it
alleged
that
there
was
a
cause
of
action
directly
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
not
based
on
1983,
but
brought
directly
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
for
which
1331
provided
jurisdiction.
now,
let
me…
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
suppose
it
would
but
of
course,
the
plaintiff
did
not
need
1331.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
it
would
if
in
fact
he
could
sue
the
school
district
under
1983
that
is
to
say
it
would
only
provided
a
jurisdictional
basis
for
a
1983
action
if
he
had
a
cause
of
action
on
the
1983
and
that
turns
on
whether
the
school
board
is
a
person.
but
as
we
will
see
in
a
moment,
our
main
point
will
be
that
the
person’s
limitation
of
1983
is
not
a
limitation
on
the
course
of
action
directly
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
if
i
may
just
refer
that
for
one
moment,
it
is
going
to
be
the
central
focus
of
my
discussion
here,
but
i
do
want
to
just
say
one
thing
first
because
if
i
do
not
say
it
first,
i
am
going
to
lose
it
and
that
is
that
in
so
far
as
this
is
a
suit
for
reinstatement,
let
us
forget
the
back
pay
for
a
moment.
there
was
clearly
jurisdiction
under
1983
and
1343
because
this
was
a
suit
against
the
school
board
officials
in
their
official
capacities
as
well
as
against
the
school
board.
and
in
so
far,
as
it
is
to
suit
against
the
school
board
officials,
the
court
had
authority,
they
are
persons
within
the
meaning
of
1983.
the
court
had
authority
to
direct
them
to
take
the
step
of
reinstating
the
plaintiff.
the
jurisdictional
predicate
here
is
precisely
the
same
as
this
court
has
always
used
in
all
of
the
school
desegregation
cases.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
except
they
were
not
concerned
about
the
eleventh
amendment
theory,
but
it
is
the
same
kind
of
thing.
you
get
relief
which
the
school
board
as
an
entity
must
in
fact
provide
by
directing
the
officers
of
the
school
board
to
provide
it.
and
indeed
i
think
the
moment
start
will
make
clear
that
all
of
the
school
desegregation
cases,
which
result
in
orders
directing
school
boards
to
take
certain
actions,
are
1983
actions
in
which
the
award
is
obtained,
where
the
relief
is
obtained
by
directing
it
to
the
school
officials.
they
are
directed
to
take
certain
actions.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
we
have
a
very
peculiar
problem,
justice
stevens,
and
in
a
sense
we
are
going
to
have
to
ask
for
the
court’s
indulgence
on
it.
no
jurisdictional
issue
was
raised
in
the
district
court.
it
was
never
asserted
by
the
defendants
that
there
was
a
lack
of
jurisdiction
here.
as
a
result,
when
the
district
court
found
1331
jurisdiction
over
the
school
board
and
provided
all
of
the
relief
that
was
sought,
while
technically
the
plaintiffs
should
have
a
cross
appeal
from
the
court’s
failure
to
keep
the
school
board
individuals
in
and
undoubtedly
would
have
done
so
if
there
had
been
a
jurisdictional
issue
raised
in
the
district
court,
they
were
lulled
into
not
cross
appealing
by
their
belief
that
there
were
no
jurisdictional
issues
confronting
them
down
the
road
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
of
course
it
does,
your
honor,
and
that
is
why
i
say
we
have
to
beg
the
court’s
indulgence
if
we
lose
on
1331.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
it
was
actually
cited
as
1931
but
it
was
a
typographical
error
and
the
district
court…
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
it
was
understood
by
the
district
court
as
1331.
that
is
our
only
barrier
we
are
in
(inaudible).
but
we
would
on
the
point
that
justice
stevens
raised,
there
have
been
a
number
of
court
of
appeals
decisions
recently
because
the
jurisdictional
problems
in
this
area
are
so
complex
that
if
held
that
a
plaintiff
if
he
appears
to
have
a
valid
jurisdictional
basis,
even
if
he
did
not
pleaded
in
the
complaint,
is
entitled
to
have
a
remand
so
that
he
can
in
fact
do
so
and
so
that
his
relief
with
the
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights
is
not
forever
denied
him
because
of
the
complexities
of
charting
one’s
way
through
this
jurisdictional
thicket.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it
is
not
as
broad
as
that.
what
the
courts
have
essentially
done
is
created
a
special
--
it
is
not
pleading.
they
say
you
brought
the
suit
and
you
have
asserted
the
wrong
jurisdictional
provision.
you
could
technically
be
barred
forever,
but
given
that
this
is
a
civil
rights
action,
given
that
we
found
the
violation
of
your
constitutional
rights,
given
that
we
believe
there
is
an
adequate
jurisdictional
basis
upon
which
this
action
could
have
been
predicated,
we
are
going
to
remand
and
allow
you
to
amend
the
complaint.
they
are
not
saying
the
complaint
in
its
present
form
suffices
to
actually
raise
this
jurisdictional
point
even
though
you
have
not
recited
this
action
by
its
terms.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
it
is
not
quite
the
same.
there
have
been
two
fifth
circuit
decisions
where
they
have
allowed
a
remand
to
amend
the
complaint
to
bring
in
additional
parties
in
a
context
where
only
the
entity
was
sued
and
the
court
concluded
that
the
suit
should
have
been
brought
against
the
individual.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
that
is
right.
what
we
do
not
have
one
here
either
if
this
court
allows
the
remand
because
we
are
still
in
the
same
cause
of
action.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
complaint
is
perfect.
the
problem
is
that…
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
in
essence
and
that
is
why
i
say
we
beg
the
court’s
indulgence
on
it
because
obviously
we
do
not
have
a
right
to
that.
but
let
me
go
on
because
there
are
obviously
more
basis…
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
suppose
we
are
in
the
position
that
we
cannot
proceed
to
seek
reinstatement
under
1983
against
the
school
officials
in
their
official
capacities
for
want
of
an
appeal
having
been
taken.
i
think
that
is
where
we
are
at
and
assuming
we
are
right
on
the
merits,
the
teacher,
who
was
in
fact
right,
who
brought
this
lawsuit,
who
has
secured
complete
relief
in
the
district
court
and
who
presumptively
for
the
moment
is
going
to
have
it
on
the
merits
affirmed
if
only
the
court
would
recognize
the
jurisdictional
basis,
we
will
go
with
our
relief
on
reinstatement.
but
let
me
go
on
because
i
think
we
avoid
the
problem
if
we
are
right
that
there
is
jurisdiction
against
the
school
board.
now,
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
has
decided
either
of
the
1983
person
questions
which
would
have
to
be
decided.
if
the
court
were
going
to
say
that
relief
cannot
be
obtained
under
1983
and
those
two
questions
are
the
following:
number
one…
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
is
what
this
court
held
in
city
of
kenosha.
under
1983,
if
the
school
board
is
not
a
person,
which
has
not
yet
been
decided,
but
if
the
school
board
in
not
a
person
under
1983
and
if
there
is
not
1331
jurisdiction…
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
is
what
city
of
kenosha
squarely
held.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
if
you
do
that.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
is
correct,
any
relief.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
any
relief.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
it
is
not,
your
honor,
it
is
not
an
immunity
it
is
simply
that
congress
did
not
create
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
is
correct
and
it
is
important
that
it
is
not
an
immunity
because
i
will
get
to
it
in
a
moment.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
now,
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
has
decided
whether
this
school
district
is
a
person
in
the
same
sense
that
a
municipality.
we
have
not
briefed
that
question
because
neither
court
reached
it.
it
was
our
view
that
if
this
court
found
jurisdiction
was
improper
under
1331,
that
the
appropriate
step
would
be
a
remand
for
the
district
court
to
decide
an
issue
which
neither
it
nor
the
court
of
appeals
ever
reached,
particularly
so
because
the
issue
may
turn,
not
necessarily,
but
may
turn
upon
the
precise
status
of
school
districts
in
ohio.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
oh!
clearly
i
think
when
it
said
it
states
no
conclusion
on
the
monroe
kenosha
problem
what
he
means.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
is
right,
i
think
the
reference
to
1983
was
it
was
clearly
a
proper
1983
case
against
the
school
officials
and
he
ruled
on
the
merits
that
as
individuals
they
would
not
have
to
pay
the
judgment
because
they
had
not
engaged
in
that
bad
faith
and
etcetera
that
would
be
strict
and
would
dictate,
entitling
liability.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
but
they
both
are
sort
of
short
hands
for
a
combination
of
a
cause
of
action
and
the
jurisdiction
predicate,
when
one
refers
to
1983
commonly,
the
lower
courts,
when
they
refer
to
1983
they
refer
to
as
jurisdictional,
when
of
course
it
is
a
cause
of
action
which
provides
jurisdiction
under
1343
or
for
which
the
jurisdiction
is
provided.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
i
am
going
to
reach
that
right
now.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
is
right.
let
me
come
now
to
that.
in
bivens,
this
court
held
that
one
could
bring
a
cause
of
action
for
damages
directly
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
directly
under
the
fourth
amendment,
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
directly
under
the
fourth
amendment
against
federal
officials.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
is
correct,
but
the
point
was
that
the
fourth
amendment
itself
coupled
with
the
jurisdictional
power
granted
by
1331
which
enabled
the
federal
courts
to
decide
all
questions
arising
under
the
constitution
was
sufficient
to
allow
a
cause
of
action
for
damages,
now
for
the
moment
not
against
the
municipality,
we
will
get
to
that
in
a
moment.
it
was
sufficient
to
allow
a
cause
of
action
under
1331,
even
though
congress
had
not
enacted
any
statute
providing
such
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
that
is
right.
the
existence
of
the
constitutional
amendment
implied
that
once
congress
than
conferred
federal
jurisdiction
under
1331
and
said
that
questions
arising
under
the
constitution
could
be
heard
by
the
federal
courts.
it
was
implied
that
there
would
be
a
cause
of
action
for
damages
from
the
fourth
amendment
itself
because
otherwise
the
amendment
could
not
effectively
be
implemented.
if
you
take
the
words
and
let
us
forget
for
the
moment
the
problem
that
we
here
have,
municipality…
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
it
does
not
say
that
your
honor.
what
it
says
is,
that
13,
that
their
implicit
in
the
constitution
is
a
cause
of
action
for
damages
provided
congress
confers
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
is
true.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
but
i
think
we
have
to
recall
the
chronology
here.
when
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
passed
or
enacted
in
the
late
1860s,
there
was
no
federal
question
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts
and
so
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
necessity
had
to
say,
as
it
did
say,
the
congress
will
enact
such
legislation
as
will
be
necessary
to
provide
for
the
enforcement
of
this
amendment.
that
was
necessary
because
the
whole
predicate
of
the
amendment
was
there
ought
to
be
a
federal
cause
of
action
and
there
was
no
federal
jurisdiction
to
enforce
it.
now,
congress’
first
response
to
that,
to
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
the
enactment
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871
which
contain
what
are
both
now
1983
and
1343.
the
cause
of
action
and
the
jurisdictional
provision
were
enacted
together
to
provide
a
cause
of
action
for
damages
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
at
that
time
in
1871,
congress
taking
its
first
tentative
step
in
this
area
made
the
judgment
not
to
permit
suits
against
municipality
so
at
least
so
this
court
held
in
monroe
v.
pape,
there
are
many
commentators
you
think
that
is
a
misreading
of
the
legislative
history,
but
we
would
accept
that.
we
are
obviously
bound
by
monroe
v.
pape.
in
1971,
congress
said,
we
do
not
want
to
create
this
cause
of
action
against
the
municipality
itself,
but
only
against
the
officials
and
if
that
is
where
things
stood,
there
would
no
predicate
for
bringing
a
suit
in
federal
court
against
the
municipality.
but
four
years
later,
congress
enacted
1331.
at
that
time
it
expressed
none
of
the
cautions
that
it
had
expressed
in
1871,
indeed
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
commented
in
discussing
1331,
its
intention
was
with
certain
very
specific
exceptions
to
invest
the
federal
courts
with
the
entire
body
of
federal
question
jurisdiction
which
constitutionally
could
be
invested
in
them.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
what
bell
versus
hood
said
was,
and
i
think
really
this
is
a
all
this
court
needs
to
decide
in
this
case
given
and
i
will
get
to
that
in
a
moment,
bell
versus
hood
said
if
a
plaintiff
comes
into
federal
court
and
says,
“i
claim
a
cause
of
action
directly
under
an
amendment
of
the
constitution”
and
he
asserts
the
$10000
as
in
controversy,
the
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
that
claim
on
the
merits.
now,
the
court
in
bell
v.
hood
said
there
are
a
lot
of
questions
the
court
has
going
to
have
to
decide
on
the
merits.
the
first
question
it
is
going
to
have
to
decide
on
the
merits
is
there
such
a
cause
of
action
directly
under
the
amendment.
but
if
bell
v.
hood
emphasized
that
is
a
question
on
the
merits,
not
a
jurisdiction
question,
and
if
the
court
says
yes,
there
is
a
cause
of
action,
then
it
is
going
to
have
to
go
on
and
decide
the
other
merits
of
the
questions,
you
know,
do
you
have
a
good
claim
under
that
course
of
action.
but
it
is
our
view
and
we
have
a
footnote
in
our
brief
to
this
effect,
it
is
our
view
that
if
the
defendant
has
never,
throughout
these
proceedings,
challenged
the
existence
of
the
cause
of
action
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
a
merits
issue,
that
that
issue
is
not
properly
here.
it
was
not
one
of
the
questions
presented.
it
has
not
been
briefed
by
either
party.
it
maybe
the
most
important
civil
rights
question
that
this
court
is
going
to
have
to
decide
in
the
next
decade.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
let
me
find
the
complaint.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it
says
in
contravention
of
the
constitution
and
of
section
1983,
so
it
does
allege
both.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
not
a
claim
under
1983,
and
the
claim
directly
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
complaint
alleged
the
cause
of
action
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
with
jurisdiction
on
1331.
the
defendant
challenged
jurisdiction,
he
did
not
even
challenge
that
to
the
court
of
appeals,
but
there
he
said
there
was
not
$10000
in
controversy,
but
he
never
disputed
the
existence
of
the
cause
of
action
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
is
a
merits
question,
bell
v.
hood
said.
he
never
disputed
it
in
the
district
court,
he
never
disputed
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
he
did
not
identify
it
as
a
question
presented
to
this
court,
and
in
our
view
therefore
that
merits
question,
is
there
such
a
thing
as
a
cause
of
action
directly
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
not
before
the
court.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yeah,
well,
clearly
if
it
is
a
jurisdictional
question,
it
is
before
the
court.
i
would
urge
the
court,
if
the
court
were
so
minded
and
i
think
bell
v.
hood
is
squarely
to
the
contrary,
that
before
the
court
decides
an
issue
of
that
input,
it
ought
to
have
briefs,
because
this
is
an
issue
--
the
lower
courts
are
deciding
this
issue
by
the
legions.
you
will
have
ample
opportunity
to
decide
it
in
the
case
when
it
is
properly
briefed.
you
can
even
direct
further
briefing
in
this
case,
but
i
view
if
the
real
trepidation
that
the
court
will
decide
the
issue
without
briefs,
we
have
a
lot,
we
would
like
to
say
on
that
issue,
but
we
did
not
understand
that
issue
to
be
properly
before
the
court,
because
as
we
read
bell
v.
hood
it
was
not
a
jurisdictional
question,
but
a
merits
question
which
was
not
raised.
the
remaining
jurisdictional
question
here
is
amount
in
controversy
and
really
with
my
limited
time,
i
would
like
to
go
on
to
other
issues.
i
think
we
dealt
with
that
in
our
brief.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
is
interesting.
now,
i
guess
--
it
never
occurred
to
me
until
your
honor
asked
the
question,
but
obviously
for
the
same
reason,
the
answer
is
no,
it
is
not
jurisdiction,
although
jurisdiction
does
depend
on
it.
that
is
to
say,
if
i
allege
a
cause
of
action
under
1983
saying
that
a
school
board
is
a
person,
that
is
a
merits
question,
is
there
such
a
cause
of
action
and
yet
jurisdiction,
i
guess
the
mere
allegation
of
it.
if
in
the
same
way
that
bell
v.
hood
does,
the
mere
allegation
of
that
cause
of
action
confers
jurisdiction,
but
if
the
court
decides
on
the
merits
that
the
school
board
is
not
a
person
then
on
the
merits,
you
fail
on
your
cause
of
action.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
one
of
the
terrible
problems
about
this
case
your
honor
is
that
almost
every
issue
that
is
before
this
court
and
they
are
all
terribly
important
issues,
is
here
without
having
been
raised
by
the
defendants
in
the
district
court
with
no
record
and
a
record
would
have
been
made
both
on
jurisdiction
and
the
eleventh
amendment,
if
they
have
been
put
an
issue,
i
can
assure
the
court…
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
that
is
always
true
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
true
meaning
of
bell
v.
hood
is
that
a
plaintiff
who
comes
into
federal
court
and
says,
“i
have
a
cause
of
action
and
this
is
my
cause
of
action”
and
who
cites
the
appropriate
jurisdictional
provisions
which
that
cause
of
action
would
trigger.
in
fact
has
properly
asserted
jurisdiction
and
it
then
lies
with
the
defendant
to
challenge
the
existence
of
the
cause
of
action
and
that
is
not
really
an
accurate
statement,
it
always
lies
with
the
plaintiff
to
establish
his
cause
of
action.
but
if
the
defendant
never
disputes
the
existence
of
the
cause
of
action
that
is
a
merits
question
and
the
defendant
is
going,
if
the
court
accepts
that
there
is
such
a
cause
of
action,
the
defendant
is
going
to
be
stuck
with
it.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
now,
the
court
is
always
free
to
raise
the…
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
now,
on
both
questions,
this
court
does
not
have
briefing
from
the
parties.
both
questions
are
of,
i
cannot
describe
what
great
importance
they
are
for
school
desegregation
cases,
for
this
kind
of
case,
for
almost
any
kind
of
fourteenth
amendment
case
and
i
cannot
plead
too
strongly
with
the
court
that
if
the
court
is
going
to
disagree
with
us
that
they
are
not
jurisdictional,
and
therefore,
not
properly
before
the
court
that
we
would
request
an
opportunity
to
brief
them,
or
a
great
deal
turns
on
this
and
it
should
not
be
decided
in
a
case
where
it
is
not
before
the
court
and
where
we
really
need
to
decide,
is
brief
this
issue.
now,
i
have
got
about
7
minutes
remaining
by
my
count
and
i
have
got
a
choice
between
getting
into
what
is
really
a
fascinating
first
amendment
issue
and
a
fascinating
eleventh
amendment
issue
and
my
instinct
is
to
go
to
the
first
amendment
and
i
say
that
because
if
anyone
wants
to
ask
questions
about
the
eleventh
amendment,
i
may
probably
will
not
get
to
it.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
eleventh
amendment
issue
was
raised
in
the
opening
appellate
brief
by
the
defendant.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
the
district
court
raised
it
on
it
is
own
motion.
i
think
that
is
how
the
defendant
discovered
that
it
existed.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
no,
it
said
it
is
been
waived.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
it
was
briefed
by
both
sides
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
without
mentioning
it
and
so
it
is
here
again
in
this
peculiar
posture
that
a
terribly
important
issue
and
all
of
these
issues,
incidentally
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals
are
ruling
in
our
favor,
that
is
obviously
not
controlling
in
this
court
but
we
would
certainly
like
to
bring
to
this
court’s
attention
the
analytical
guidance
that
those
lower
courts
have
provided
before
this
court
rules
on
it,
but
the
eleventh
amendment
issue
was
terribly
important.
it
has
never
been
discussed
by
the
lower
courts
in
this
case.
if
it
had
been
raised
in
the
district
court,
we
would
have
made
a
record.
we
would
have
shown
that
there
is
not
any
possible
way
that
this
judgment
would
have
cost
the
state
a
penny,
that
there
is
an
independent
entity,
the
school
board
which
is
not
the
alter
ego
of
the
state.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
we
at
least
know
it
from
edelman
your
honor,
i
am
not
sure…
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes
it
did.
there
is
not
question
that
it
did.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
again
we
are
under
fair
warning,
but
it
is
a
defense.
on
that
one
this
court
said
both
in
edelman
and
in
sosna
versus
iowa,
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
defense.
it
is
a
defense
that
they
do
not
waive
by
failing
to
raise
it
in
the
district
court.
they
can
assert
this
defense
for
the
first
time
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
even
in
the
supreme
court,
but
it
is
nonetheless
a
defense,
and
the
plaintiff
does
not
have
the
burden
to
come
in
and
prove
the
non
existence
of
an
immunity
which
is
not
asserted
by
the
defendant.
this
court
i
believe
in
sosna
said
it
was
in
an
affirmative
defense
so
i
do
not
want
to
overstate.
in
any
event,
had
it
been
raised,
and
it
is
a
defense
i
think,
had
it
been
raised,
we
would
have
made
a
record.
that
record
would
have
shown
beyond
per
adventure
of
doubt
that
an
award
in
this
case
or
back
pay
will
not
impact
upon
the
treasury
of
the
state
of
ohio.
that
would
impact
only
on
treasury
of
the
school
board,
and
beyond
that,
it
seems
to
me
we
had
a
further
point
to
make
which
we
do
make
in
our
brief,
which
is
even
if
for
some
reason
we
could
not
collect
this
from
the
school
board
and
the
school
board
has
been
tendering
suggestions
to
this
court
that
maybe
they
could
not
get
the
voters
to
approve
a
bond
issue
or
a
tax
levy
or
whatever,
even
if
we
were
unable
to
collect
that
would
not
implicate
the
state
treasury.
we
would
not
be
the
first
plaintiffs
who
got
a
judgment
that
was
uncollectible,
but
it
would
not
give
us
a
cause
of
action
then
against
the
state
to
make
the
state
pay.
it
is
a
judgment
against
the
school
board.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
okay,
thank
you
your
honor.
there
are
two
merits
question,
they
are
both
fascinating.
the
first
one
is
was
the
school
board
entitled
to
rely
on
the
phone
call
in
making
it
is
decision,
not
to
renew
this
teacher’s
employment.
we
think
the
answer
to
that
is
clearly
that
they
were
no
entitled
to
rely
on
it.
we
have
briefed
that
at
some
length,
and
i
think
as
carefully
as
we
could,
in
my
limited
time
i
would
like
to
reach
the
other
question
which
is
really
new
to
this
court
and
that
is
how
are
the
federal
courts
to
deal
with
the
situation
in
which
it
is
found
that
a
school
board
or
another
public
employer
has
relied
on
more
than
one
reason
in
reaching
it
is
decision
not
to
continue
employment.
one
of
those
reasons
is
an
impermissible
reason
upon
which
it
had
no
right
to
rely
and
the
other
one
or
more,
i
think
the
district
court
fairly
read,
found
that
there
were
only
two
reasons
here,
the
second
reason
was
a
reason
upon
which
they
could
rely,
does
that
mean
automatic…
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
those
things,
the
letter
they
gave
him
saying
what
was
wrong.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
other
was
the
gesture
to
the
students
in
the…
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it
characterizes
itself,
i
will
accept
that.
in
any
event
we
do
not
assert
that
that
is
a
first
amendment
protective
gesture.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
is
right.
when
we
say
we
admit
that
the
first
would
have
been
a
proper
foundation
if
that
is
in
fact
what
would
have
actuated
the
words
alone,
to
decide
not
to
renew.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
there
was
a
dispute
between…
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
at
most
there
are
only
five
that
were
testified
by
the
witnesses,
including
the
written
phone
calls
so
there
are
two
plus
three
others.
the
critical
piece
of
evidence,
upon
which
the
district
court
appears
to
have
relied
and
certainly
supports
the
district
courts
finding,
was
the
letter
they
gave
to
the
teacher,
when
he
said
why
did
you
deny
me
renewal,
and
they
said,
one,
two,
but
be
that
as
it
may
whether
it
is
two
or
five,
we
have
a
case…
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
now,
if
we
could
only
know
what
the
school
board
would
have
done
but
for
the
phone
call,
we
know
how
to,
it
seems
to
me
how
to
deal
with
this
case.
if
we
knew
for
example
that
but
for
the
phone
call
the
school
board
would
have
given
him
his
contract,
then
it
is
clear
that
there
is
a
remedy
he
ought
to
get
his
contract.
on
the
other
hand
if
we
knew
that
the
other
one
or
more
incidents
standing
alone
would
have
convinced
them
to
deny
him
renewal,
then
it
is
clear
that
he
ought
not
to
get
his
contract
as
a
remedy,
or
the
back
pay,
but
we
cannot
know,
not
only
do
we
not
know,
we
cannot
know,
because
as
a
result
of
the
improper
reliance
on
that
one
issue,
the
school
board
never
made
the
decision
it
was
supposed
to
make.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
it
assumes
that
there
was
reliance
on
this
which
the
district
court
found
and
which
the…
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
we
have
to
assume
that
this
was…
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
i
have
assumed
it.
that
is
right
and
i
have
urged
the
court
that
since
i
have
now
one
minute
we
brief
the
preposition
that
it
is
improper
and
i
want
to
address
the
question
of
how
does
the
court
remedy
the
solution.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
in
the
facts
of
this
case…
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right
and
it
is
not,
it
was
not
a
tactless
phone
call,
they
just
put
tact
as
a
label
on
the
fact
that
he
made
the
phone
call.
now
our
view
is
that
guidance
is
provided
in
a
number
of
areas
of
what
should
you
do
when
you
have
a
mixed
improper
decision
which
is
that
you
put
the
burden
on
the
wrong
doer,
as
judge
leonard
han
(ph)
said
in
a
very
similar
in
nlrb
case
to
disentangle
the
consequences
for
which
he
is
chargeable,
from
those
from
which
he
is
immune
from
responsibility.
it
is
his
burden
to
persuade
the
trial
effect
that
even
without
this
incident
he
would
have
reached
the
same
decision.
this
court
apply
that
same
standard
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act,
last
year
in
franks
versus
bowmen
transportation
saying
that
where
race
was
a
factor
in
a
employer’s
decision
to
deny
employment
to
somebody
that
does
not
mean
that
he
might
not
have
denied
employment
to
him
anyway,
but
the
burden
is
going
to
be
on
the
employer
to
show
that
would
have
reached
the
same
decision
even
if
race
had
not
been
a
factor.
now,
these
have
all
been
statutory
causes
of
action,
where
the
violation
of
the
statutory
right
shifted
the
burden
to
the
defendant,
and
we
submit
that
the
rule
surely
must
be
at
least
the
same,
when
it
is
a
violation
of
one’s
constitutional
right
which
has
created
this
mixed
motive
dilemma
that
the
burden
must
be
on
the
defendant
and
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
there
was
no
evidence
introduced
in
this
case
from
which
the
court
could
have
find
and
indeed
the
court
did
not
find
that
the
defendant
met
that
burden.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
think
not
your
honor,
anymore
than
under
section
83
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
forbids
discharges
based
on
union
activity
or
extension
from
union
activity.
the
labor
board
has
been
adjudicating
for
four
decades
in
which
the
parties
knew
that
a
mixed
motive
termination
led
to
what
judge
leonard
han
said
it
led
to
it,
disentangling
of
the
consequences
and
the
remedy
dependent
on
that.
for
four
decades
parties
have
developed
a
whole
body
of
laws
developed
which
is
used
by
analogy
in
this
first
amendment
cases.
of
course
the
school
board
never
rarely
say
as
this
one
so
candidly
did,
we
relied
on
this
and
yet
you
can
find
from
other
evidence
on
occasions
that
they
did.
you
can
find
that
the
disparate
treatment
for
example,
ten
people
did
the
other
things
they
are
lying
on,
the
only
difference
is
this
teacher
made
a
speech
and
how
would
he
goes.
there
are
a
variety
of
those.
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
to
us
more
troublesome
which
is
if
we
do
not
have
a
burden
on
the
defendant
in
the
mixed
motive
cases,
every
school
board
that
wants
to
fire
a
defendant
for
a
first
amendment
reason,
well,
simply
no
teacher
can
teach
for
five
years
without
having
done
something
that
somebody
could
find
objectionable.
even
though
their
motivation
is
solely
the
first
amendment
reason,
they
will
just
tack
on
to
two
or
three
other
incidents
that
are
just.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
either
with
or
without,
if
the
court
says
that
as
long
as
there
is
collection
of
reasons,
as
long
if
it
is
a
mixed
decision
we
are
going
to
sustain
it,
then
they
can
be
perfectly
candid
and
say
well
we
do
not
like
the
fact
that
you
made
this
first
amendment
speech
but
we
also
notice
that
two
years
ago
you
made
an
obscene
gesture
in
cafeteria,
so
ha,
ha
there
is
nothing
you
can
do
about
it.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it
does
except
–
well,
i
guess
that
is
right.
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant
to
show
that
it
was
indeed
harmless
and
in
that
sense
it
is
the
same,
that
is
right.
well,
the
prosecution
was
the
wrong
doer
in
that
case,
and
the
burden
is
on
the
wrong
doer,
if
i
can
use
that
word.
wrong
doer
is
the
wrong
word
for
the
prosecution.
the
burden
is
on
the
party.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
did
not
mean
that.
the
burden
is
on
the
party
who
wants
sustain
the
result
even
though
one
of
the
factors
that
led
to
the
result
is
now
going
to
be
removed
to
show
that
that
factor
was
not
critical
to
the
result.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
and
they
are
under
no
obligation
to,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
it
would
not
be
a
first
amendment
violation
if
we
could
find
out
independently
that
that
was
the
reason
that
they
did
not.
