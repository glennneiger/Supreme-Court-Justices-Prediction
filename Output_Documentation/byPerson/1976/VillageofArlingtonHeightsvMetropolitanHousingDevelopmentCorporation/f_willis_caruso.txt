mr.
f.
willis
caruso
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
not
a
garden
variety
zoning
case.
this
is
a
case
of
racial
discrimination.
mr.
ransom
and
mr.
guthrie
do
desire
to
live
near
where
they
work,
and
they
do
not
want
to
drive
40
and
50
minutes
a
day
to
get
there
in
chicago’s
bitter
and
cold
weather.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
yes,
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
the
testimony
and
give
you
testimony
of
both
guthrie
and
ransom
show
that
they
went
out
and
looked,
what
counsel
is
referring
to
as
he
was
saying
that
because
they
did
not
go
and
confront
white
people.
that
they
did
not
know
that
they
could
confront
white
people,
that
they
looked
but
they
could
not
find
what
they
wanted
and
perhaps
because
of
their
fear
of
whites
and
their
fear
of
this
location
did
not
pursue
it,
that
is
not
looking,
that
cannot
be
the
case.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
finding,
your
honor,
squares
with
the
standard
set
by
washington
v.
davis.
i
think
although
it
may
not
fall
completely
in
the
washington
versus
davis
format,
the
court,
in
looking
at
valtierra
and
analyzing
the
situation
said
that
the
impact
alone
was
not
sufficient,
but
taking
into
account
the
totality
of
the
situation
and
then
they
went
through
to
the
totality,
the
high
segregation
of
chicago
metropolitan
area.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
i
think
that
there
clearly
are
two
aspects
of
that.
first,
both
at
the
discovery
level
and
again
at
the
trial
level,
the
court
precluded
us
from
going
into
the
question
of
motivation,
purpose
and
intent...
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
no,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
directly
go
to
all
of
the
questions
as
clearly...
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
based
on
the
buffer
zone
application,
i
would
also
agree,
however,
that
that
they
did
not
set
aside
anything
as
clearly
erroneous,
but
there
are
two
aspects
of
it.
one
is
that
we
were
not
allowed
to
go
into
intent
and
motive
because
of
palmer
v.
thomason
and
o’brian
at
that
time
and
the
court
said,
that
is
judge
mcmillan,
said
that
his
perception
of
this
case
was
that
motive
and
attempt
was
not
important,
that
if
the
impact
could
be
shown
that
that
was
sufficient.
based
on
his
perception
of
the
case
then
he
prevented
us
from
asking
mrs.
harms
and
other
people
what
happened
at
the
meeting.
what
was
discussed?
what
was
the
intent?
what
was
the
purpose?
we
could
not
go
into
that.
in
addition
to
that,
however,
we
believed
that
the
record
shows
from
the
bitter
statements,
in
the
papers,
the
letters,
the
nature
of
this
meetings
that
the
intent
and
purpose
of
the
racial
discrimination
and
the
statement
by
mayor
walsh
at
the
end,
that
this
was
a
mandate
from
the
people.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
no,
i
think
that
the
washington
v.
davis
standard
allows
the
determination
of
purpose
and
intent
from
the
totality
of
the
facts
and
that
the
totality
of
the
facts
here
shows
the
racial
purpose
for
denying
this
development.
the
whole
totality
of
the
situation
and
the
fact
that
there
is
no
real
reason
for
turning
it
down,
means
there
is
no
integrity
to
the
zoning
ordinance.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
client
and
the
budding
property
owners
of
those
17
homes
was
not
the
kind
of
substantial
reason
that
would
allow
this
kind
of
discriminatory
affect.
so
we
believed
that
within
the
washington
v.
davis
framework,
the
purpose
and
intent
can
be
shown.
in
addition
to
ransom
and
guthrie,
who
worked
and
had
been
moved
to
arlington
heights
and
that
is
in
the
transcript,
and
it
starts
with
page
220
of
the
transcript
with
guthrie’s
testimony.
mhdc
has
standing
and
desires
to
build
and
can
build.
at
the
time
of
the
trial
236
was
not
dead.
president
nixon
at
that
time
had
a
moratorium
on
236
and
later
a
court
of
appeals
held
that
that
would
not
stand.
since
that
time,
the
community
development
act
has
been
passed
and
under
section
8;
this
development
can
be
built
with
a
very
similar
type
of
financing
and
provisions
for
low
and
moderate
income
people.
if
there
was
a
period
of
moratorium
that
is
passed
and
it
can
now
be
constructed
and
mhdc
is
prepared
to
go
ahead.
it
has
a
definite
important
stake
in
this
case
and
would
like
to
get
on
with
building
these
low
and
moderate-income
housing.
mrs.
maldonado
also
testified,
although
it
is
not
directly
a
testimony
as
to
her
present
location
and
there
was
testimony
of
record
about
the
low
standard
of
housing
that
spanish-americans
are
allowed
to
live
in
arlington
heights.
there
is
a
pledge
by
mhdc
to
continue
to
control
this.
this
is
a
not
for
profit
corporation
without
standing
board
of
directors
which
is
concerned
with
equal
opportunity
in
housing
throughout
chicago
metropolitan
area.
they
give
letters
to
the
municipality.
they
committed
to
sticking
with
this
development
forever
to
see
that
it
was
well
constructed,
well
managed
by
this
not
profit
corporation.
so
the
commitment
and
the
stake
fully
provides
for
the
question
of
warth
v.
seldin
and
a
stake
in
the
development.
all
of
these
people
have
standing.
the
zoning...
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
that
is
right
your
honor
and
the
district
court
found
that
clearly
maldonado
and
mhdc
had
sufficient
standing
and
i
do
not
believe
they
said
guthrie,
that
is
judge
mcmillan
said
guthrie
and
ransom
did
not
have
standing
to
represent
the
class,
but
he
did
not
ruled
that
they
personally
did
not
have
standing.
the
zoning
here
is
good
zoning
for
mhdc
which
is
a
two-storey
or
one-and-a-half
and
two-storey
townhouse
development
with
individual
entrances,
60%
is
open
space.
it
is
like
and
compatible
with
as
a
witness
testified,
with
the
surrounding
homes.
it
is
a
very
nice
good-looking
development
with
mature
trees
and
before
the
application
and
the
administrative
process
which
was
completely
followed
and
the
judge
found
that,
mhdc
worked
with
the
village,
provided
hard
stands
for
fire
protection,
changed
the
garbage,
reroute
the
roads,
gave
the
village
everything
that
was
necessary
to
make
it
a
really
high
class
fine
development.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
no
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
it
does.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
no,
i
think
that
euclid
said
that
the
zoning
law
was
entitled
to
control
the
zoning
with
in
the
municipality,
but
i
think
the
euclid
and
necto
v.
cambridge
indicated
that
that
was
limited
by
the
fact
that
if
there
were
other
requirements
and
other
needs,
safety,
public
health,
the
other
interests
of
the
community
that
those,
which
still
have
to
be
considered
that
euclid
does
not
override
everything.
zoning
is
not
above
all.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
i
think
that...
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
i
do
not
think
that
is
what
overcomes
euclid.
i
think
what
overcomes
euclid
is
the
fact
that
this
is
a
highly
discriminatory
market,
that
they
have
no
low
and
moderate
income
housing.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
no
your
honor,
it
is
not.
our
case
is
not
base
on
discrimination
against
poor
people.
it
is
based
on
discrimination
against
blacks
and
other
minorities,
and
the
overriding
need
for
this
housing
in
this
area.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
can
who
buy
it,
your
honor?
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
i
believe
that
it
would
have
a
tremendous
difficulty
in
arlington
heights
or
any
other
municipality
in
the
suburbs
of
chicago.
it
is
a
highly
racial
discriminatory
market.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
well,
he
says
that
there
200
in
the
recent
census.
i
have
not
checked
that
census,
i
think
that
is
high
your
honor.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
i
would
say
there
is
some
increase
in
the
number
of
blacks
in
the
area.
there
has
been
an
increase
--
excuse
me
your
honor?
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
there
could
be
as
much
as
100
--
increase
in
blacks
in
the
area.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
well,
i
think
to
say
that
the
127
people
in
the
town
of
72,000
is
an
indication
that
there
is
high
exclusion
as
there
are
in
157
other
municipalities.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
excuse
me
you
honor?
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
no,
davis’s
testimony
said
if
it
was
an
open
market,
if
it
was
a
racially
free
market,
they
are
based
on
the
value
of
the
homes
and
the
market
and
the
style
of
homes
and
the
housing
stock,
there
would
be
about
3500
blacks
living
in
arlington
heights.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
i
think
there
are,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
oh,
yes.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not,
but
this
is
not
a
town
of
$60,000
homes,
your
honor.
this
is
a
town
with
a
broad
housing
stock.
a
third
of
the
units
approximately
are
apartments.
this
is
not
a
single-family
community
with
just
single-family
homes
and
very
expensive
homes
as
a
broad
housing
stock.
it
has
right
near
this
development,
across
this
high
speed
street
to
the
south.
there
are
houses
in
the
$30,000-40,000
range.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
some
of
them
i
am
sure
had
been
for
sale,
your
honor,
since
1971.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
i
think
we
do
want.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
that
is
right,
your
honor.
one
of
the
statements
that
was
made
by
a
counsel
was
that
seven
other
parcels
were
for
sale
at
that
time.
those
parcels
were
not
for
sale,
and
they
could
not
be
used
for
low
and
moderate
income
housing
because
there
is
a
limit
of
$2,000
per
unit
in
each
of
the
homes.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
no,
your
honor.
the
arlington
heights...
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
arlington
heights
is
a
unique
situation.
a
tremendous
growth
from
1950,
8,000
people
to
now
64,884
people,
the
growth
and
jobs
which
is
set
for
a
100,000
jobs
in
that
area,
the
movement
of
jobs
from
chicago
to
that
area.
there
are
probably
six
communities
like
arlington
heights
in
the
chicago
metropolitan
area
that
would
be
in
the
category
that
we
are
here
showing;
the
tremendous
growth,
the
exclusion
of
blacks.
the
explanation
of
that
situation
and
the
lack
of
any
evidence
at
any
good
faith
effort
is
anywhere
involved
in
these
municipalities
to
deal
with
the
situation
or
to
responsively
assist
in
solving
the
problem.
here
a
not
for
profit
developer
of
the
highest
quality
has
offered
the
town
an
opportunity,
with
a
190
units,
to
solve
this
situation
and
all
we
are
asking
is
that
the
town
stand
aside
and
allow
the
purpose
of
congress
to
provide
for
fair
housing
throughout
the
united
states
and
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
to
create
opportunities
outside
the
traditional
ghettos.
for
arlington
heights
to
stand
aside
and
allow
us
to
do
that
and
it
is
not
the
parade
to
horrible
sub-striking
down
zoning.
there
maybe
six
of
these
communities
out
of
a
157
in
chicago
metropolitan
area,
there
are
maybe
six
around
other
large
metropolitan
areas
where
businesses
move
to
the
suburbs,
the
jobs
are
moving
out
there,
but
the
minorities
cannot
follow
the
jobs
and
are
required
to
give
up
the
opportunity
to
work
or
to
drive
these
tremendous
distances,
to
and
from
the
job.
in
addition,
the
zoning
around
this
piece
of
15-acre
parcel
is
vacant
at
the
present
time
to
the
north
and
to
the
west.
to
the
east
there
are
17
single-family
homes
which
actually
have
bought
the
property.
to
the
north
is
an
open
space,
which
is
the
playfield
of
the
football
practice
field
for
the
high
school
and
to
the
west
is
a
communal
living
facility
in
which
the
various
clerics
live.
it
is
a
three-storey,
very
large
building
which
is
the
nature
of
the
living
facility
for
the
people
working
for
and
participating
in
the
training
of
the
high
school
and
other
st.
viator
institutions.
to
the
south
is
a
highly
traveled
street,
euclid
avenue
that
runs
to
the
arlington
heights
racetrack
and
there
is
a
testimony
that
it
is
a
very
highly
traveled
business
street
to
the
south
of
that
of
single-family
homes.
and
to
the
south
and
to
the
west
are
88
acre
parcel
are
some
single
family
homes
which
are
of
the
lesser
prices,
$30,000-40,000.
we
are
not
asking
the
town
to
do
any
affirmative
duty,
in
the
cases
that
the
counsel
cites
do
not
relate
to
this
case.
this
is
not
a
lindsey
v.
norman
case.
we
have
gone
through
the
cases
he
has
cited
in
the
brief,
this
is
not
that
case.
this
is
a
case
where
there
is
no
requirement
on
the
village.
the
tax
impact
study,
which
is
in
the
record,
shows
that
per
people
income
from
this
development
will
be
higher
than
if
it
were
a
single
family
per
people.
the
income
to
the
village
would
be
higher
than
if
it
were
a
single
family,
so
the
village
will
make
money
on
this
development.
there
is
no
problem
with
water,
sewer,
the
traffic
problem
is
slight
and…
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
yes,
your
honor
it
was,
and
that
is
one
of
the
things,
it
is
extraordinary
in
the
totality
of
facts.
all
of
the
evidence
presented
by
all
of
these
experts:
bart
and
ashman
a
leading
traffic
study,
tax
impact
people,
experts
on
housing
and
urban
development.
all
of
these
range
of
experts
were
all
in
the
record
and
all
show
that
is
was
a
good
zoning,
valuable.
there
was
no
objection
by
any
of
the
engineer
of
the
village,
the
police
chief,
the
fire
chief,
any
one
in
the
village,
they
approved
it.
there
is
a
sheet
where
they
approved
this
development.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
i
think
that
is
a
completely
different
thing
and
that
does
not.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
i
think
that
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
the
all
of
the
information
before
them
showed
the
benefits.
they
did
not
have
any
information
before
them
that
showed
anything,
but
this
was
a
good
development.
they
have
a
planner,
who
is
professional
planner,
who
is
employed
by
the
municipality
and
he
testified
that
no
one
ever
asked
him
his
opinion.
he
reviewed
it.
he
testified
he
reviewed
it,
this
is
a
professional
planner,
whose
responsibility
is
to
review
these
plans,
he
reviewed
it;
he
testified
he
had
reviewed
it.
they
never
asked
him
his
opinion
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
they
ever
ask
anybody
else.
so
that
all
the
evidence
here
shows
it
was
a
good
development.
it
met
all
the
criteria
and
in
60
other
cases
your
honor,
they
had
approved
other
zoning
and
counsel
has
referred
to
the
maps,
these
zonings
are
all
over
arlington
heights
and
53
of
those
abut
single-family
homes
and
in
some
cases,
they
abut
much
fancier
single-family
homes
than
are
involved
here.
the
process
in
arlington
heights
is
to
approve
all
these
zonings
everywhere
except
where
ours
is
and
although
the
court
found
that
there
was
not
a
yet
wall
type
of
violation.
the
court
did
find
that
their
process
of
approving
was
not
uniformly
followed.
to
compare
it,
let
us
say
to
washington
v.
davis,
this
would
be
like
giving
a
police
test
whenever
you
thought
you
should
and
whenever
whites
failed
it
allowing
them
to
be
on
the
force,
but
when
blacks
fails
it
not
allowing
them
to
be
on
the
force,
that
is
the
situation
here.
sometimes
they
apply
the
test
to
white
developments.
sometimes
they
turn
down
white
developments
for
certain
reasons,
but
whenever
the
development
comes
in
it
would
be
racially
innovated,
then
this
test
is
used
to
keep
them
out
and
that
is
the
process
of
what
sometimes
referred
to
as
a
holding
pattern
zone.
everything
is
held
as
r-3.
when
someone
comes
in
on
our
pride
like
these
60
other
cases,
they
then
approve
them
after
looking
at
who
the
developer
is;
whether,
it
can
be
assured
that
that
developer
will
bring
in
the
right
people
and
whether
or
not
it
should
be
approved,
but
in
53
of
those
cases,
the
argument
that
is
made
here
that
it
abuts
single
families
was
disregarded
completely.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
analyzing
the
totality
of
facts
and
the
record
here
is
mostly
documentary.
all
of
the
documents
were
stipulated
to
before
the
case
was
brought
to
trial
and
the
record
builds
on
that
documentary
evidence
and
reviewing
that
documentary
evidence,
the
court
of
appeals
analyzed
valtierra
and
although
maybe
did
not
completely
anticipated
washington
v.
davis,
did
talk
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
racial
impact
alone
was
not
enough
to
create
a
constitutional
violation
and
then
went
on
to
talk
about
the
racial
hostility,
to
talk
about
the
fact
that
the
village
board
recognized
that
the
people
have
this
animus
and
that
they
have
a
mandate
from
the
people
not
to
approve
this
type
of
project.
i
think
in
the
totality
of
washington
v.
davis,
it
seems
to
me
recognized
that
the
police
force
had
tried
to
find
people
to
fill
these
positions
and
when
did
not
show
up
after
they
passed
the
test
they
went
out
and
try
to
get
them
and
try
to
bring
them
in
to
get
them
on
the
force.
under
the
totality
of
facts
in
washington
v.
davis
is
a
completely
different
atmosphere,
attitude
and
background
than
there
is
on
these
all
white
community,
which
has
developed
in
a
way
to
exclude
blacks
from
that
municipality.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
yes,
we
did
your
honor.
in
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
we
urged
the
violation
of
the
1968
fair
house.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
your
honor,
in
the
district
court,
the
discussion
was
not
brought
up
where
we
had
an
opportunity
to
explain
to
judge
the
operation
of
3604
that
is
to
make
housing
otherwise
unavailable
or
3617
violation.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
we
did,
we
did.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
no
there
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
i
can
answer
that.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
your
honor,
i
just
cannot
say
it
whether
or
not
they
did.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
in
our
response
here,
your
honor?
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
yes,
your
honor,
we
are.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
constitutional
judgment
below
may
be
sustained.
we
also
believe
that
the
violation
of
the
1968
fair
housing.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
that
is
right,
your
honor,
but
we
believe
that
this
court
could
determine
on
the
statutory
basis
a
violation
of
the
1968
fair
housing
law,
under
3617
or
under
304.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
i
have
not
read
it
that
way,
your
honor.
i
cannot
explain
as
justice
white
has
indicated,
i
cannot
explain
what
was
in
the
minds
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
well,
your
honor,
i…
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
i
would
believe
that
is
correct
and
i
would
argue
however
that
we
believe
that
the
court
could
rule
with
respect
to
the
fair
housing
act
of
1968
and
we
would
urge
the
court
to
consider
that
as
well
as
the
constitutional
issue
and
we
are
continuing
to
urge
that.
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
have
continued
to
urge
that
is
that
the
congress
has
in
applying
and
accepting
its
responsibility,
interpreted
the
problem
of
fair
housing
and
discrimination
with
respect
to
housing
as
one
of
the
most
important
and
as
in
the
tropic
county
it
was
stated
a
matter
of
the
highest
priority
and
has
interpreted
the
discrimination
on
housing
issue
in
the
context
of
1968
and
indicated
how
complicated
and
sophisticated
the
discrimination
is
by
going
into
refusing
to
sell,
making
otherwise
unavailable,
denying
housing
when
in
fact
it
is
a
housing,
if
it
is
available.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
no,
i
believe
it
is
a
person
and
also
a
corporation
as
mentioned
by
the
act
your
honor.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
yes,
i
think
it
is
because
this
is
a
municipal
corporation
of
illinois.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
we
just
do
not
feel
that
they
did
that,
your
honor.
we
cannot
explain
why
we
did
present
what
we
thought
was
a
good
definition
of
what
the
1968
act
was
meant
to
do
and
that
it
did
apply
and
we
did
urgent
and
all
i
can
say
is
i
would
continue
to
urge
that
the
1968
act
be
considered
and
considering
this
case
and
i
believe
this
court
could
consider
it
even
in
light
of
what
maybe
some
indication
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
situation
with
respect
to
the
zoning
and
the
preparation
of
the
arlington
heights
development
indicates
that
in
comparison
to
the
other
developments
that
were
further
approved,
it
would
meet
the
general
requirements
of
the
municipality
and
that
the
zoning
could
have
been
approved
in
the
accordance
with
the
procedures
that
were
followed
by
the
municipality.
we
believe
that
the
evidence
does
show
that
there
was
substantial
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
municipality
and
that
the
evidence
shows
further
that
they
did
not
present
any
facts
or
reasonable
explanation
as
to
why
the
development
had
been
turned
down
and
that
is
part
of
the
totality
effects.
we
also,
in
connection
with
the
descent,
we
have
reviewed
the
record
and
the
record
indicates
that
none
of
the
seven
or
nine
parcels
were
available.
both
of
mr.
kane’s
testimony
where
he
indicates
the
prices
of
these,
some
of
them
were
$50,000
an
acre,
some
of
them
$42,000
an
acre,
indicates
there
were
no
other
r-5
parcel
zone.
that
it
could
have
been
used
because
of
the
$2,000
limit
per
unit
under
hud.
mr.
apelko,
their
own
appraiser
indicated
that
$20,000
was
the
only
parcel
he
knew
for
single-family
in
arlington
heights
and
the
multiple-family
would
all
be
hired
in
that
and
therefore
priced
out
of
the
market.
several
of
the
seven
parcels
were
too
small;
they
were
five
or
six
units.
in
others,
we
have
flooding
problems
and
the
others
were
not
for
sale
or
were
overpriced.
there
was
just
no
other
opportunity,
and
besides
that
the
only
way
this
development
can
be
dealt,
is
where
the
opportunity
comes
along
that
a
religious
order
such
as
the
clerics
of
st.
viators
makes
this
property
available
to
a
particular
developer
and
with
that
property
available
to
the
developer,
the
opportunity
to
make
this
housing
available
opportunity
bases
arises.
mhdc
built
a
similar
project
for
low
and
moderate
income
people,
212
units.
they
have
been
involved
in
other
developments.
they
have
a
record
of
showing,
they
can
bring
in
minorities
and
whites
to
provide
a
truly
integrated
development
and
that
is
what
would
be
done
here.
that
is
the
purpose
of
mhdc.
that
is
why
these
people
are
on
the
boards
of
directors
of
the
leadership
council
and
mhdc
are
working
so
hard
on
this.
we
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
being
in
accordance
with
washington
v.
davis
and
meeting
the
general
framework
where
required.
the
question
on
motivation
and
purpose
needs
further
inquiry.
one
opportunity
would
be
to
go
back
and
to
go
into
that,
but
we
feel
that
is
not
necessary
on
this
record.
we
urge
the
court
to
allow
that
court
of
appeals
opinion
to
stand
so
that
we
can
get
on
with
building
what
we
believe
will
be
a
very
fine
and
helpful
development
in
the
village
of
arlington
heights.
