mr.
jack
m.
siegel
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
causes
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court.
this
is
a
zoning
case,
which
the
circuit
court
held
that
the
refusal
to
rezone
certain
property
classified
for
single-family
use
in
the
village
of
arlington
heights,
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
so
doing,
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
the
zoning
ordinance
of
the
village
of
arlington
heights
as
applied
to
the
subject
property
was
not
administered
in
a
discriminatory
matter,
found
that
the
village
was
attempting
to
protect
neighboring
property
values
and
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
its
zoning
ordinance.
nevertheless,
the
court
based
upon
its
findings
at
the
chicago
metropolitan
area
at
a
segregated
housing
market,
applied
the
compelling
interest
test
and
held
in
substance
that
the
village
had
an
affirmative
duty
to
rezone
the
property.
in
light
of
the
fact
that
arlington
heights
in
1970
had
a
population
of
approximately
64,000,
only
27
of
whom
were
negros.
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
below,
the
respondent
here
is
the
metropolitan
housing
and
development
corporation.
it
is
'not
for
profit'
corporation
established
for
the
purpose
of
building
low
and
moderate-income
housing
in
the
chicago
metropolitan
area.
it
has
a
99-year
lease
and
purchase
agreement
with
the
clerics
of
st.
viators,
who
are
the
owners
of
the
15-acre
track,
which
is
the
subject
matter
of
this
litigation.
the
15-acre
track
is
part
of
an
80-acre
track
owned
by
st.
viators,
which
is
presently
improved
for
the
boys’
high
school
in
novitiate,
and
an
old
single-family
dwelling.
the
property
has
been
zoned
as
part
of
the
80-acre
track
since
the
beginning
of
zoning
in
arlington
heights
for
single
family
development.
under
the
1959
comprehensive
plan
of
the
village
of
arlington
heights,
the
subject
property
was
shown
for
single-family
purposes.
the
portion
of
the
property,
which
is
subject
to
the
99-year
lease
and
the
option
to
purchase
consists
of
approximately
1,100
feet
in
the
north
and
south
direction
and
approximately
600
feet
in
an
east
and
west
direction.
it
is
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
the
(r-3)
zoning
classification,
and
with
the
exception
of
the
property
also
owned
by
st.
viators,
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
a
single
family
well-established
residential
district.
under
the
provisions
of
the
arlington
heights
(r-3)
zoning
classification,
approximately
50
single
family
homes
could
be
placed
upon
the
subject
property.
the
respondent
sought
rezoning
to
the
(r-5),
which
is
the
multiple
family
classification
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
190
dwelling
units.
their
contract
purchase
was
conditioned
upon
rezoning
and
was
also
conditioned
upon
the
securing
of
a
236
mortgage
commitment
under
the
prior
federal
housing
act
236
provided
for
federal
assistance
with
respect
to
the
construction
of
multiple
family
dwelling
units.
i
would
draw
the
court's
attention
to
page
115
of
the
exhibit
volume
of
the
appendix,
in
which
we
have
a
land
use
and
zoning
map
indicating
the
physical
characteristics
of
the
surrounding
area.
i
would
also
point
out
that
exhibits
11
and
14
found
at
pages
121
and
123
contained
photographs
of
the
surrounding
area.
under
the
provisions
of
the
arlington
heights
zoning
ordinances,
high
schools
such
as
the
high
school
alumni
site,
churches
and
monasteries
or
in
this
instance
a
novitiate
are
permitted
uses
under
the
(r-3)
classification.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
arlington
heights
lies
in
the
north-west
suburban
area,
approximately
23
miles
from
the
center
of
the
city
of
chicago.
it
has
a
population
in
1970
of
64,000.
at
the
present
time,
we
recently
had
a
federal
census,
your
honor,
our
population
is
now
approximately
71,000,
as
i
indicated
in
1970,
there
were
27
blacks.
the
most
recent
census
shows
that
there
are
now
200
blacks
in
arlington
heights
and
648
other
non-white
persons.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
yes,
sir.
it
is
almost
directly
due
west
of
evanston.
now
at
the
time
of
trial
in
1973,
and
this
matter
commenced
with
the
denial
of
the
application
for
rezoning
in
1971.
arlington
heights
had
over
14,000
owner
occupied
single-family
homes.
it
also
had
more
than
6,000
multiple
family
units
in
arlington
heights,
so
this
is
not
a
case
involved
in
an
effort
to
screen
out
rebel
units.
the
zoning
in
arlington
heights
provided
for
an
additional
9,000
multiple
family
units,
that
was
on
property,
which
was
already
zoned
to
permit
multiple
family
dwelling
units.
they
can
see
rates
for
apartments
in
1970,
under
the
1970
census,
which
was
before
the
board
when
the
decision
was
made,
was
over
11%
vacancy
in
the
(r-5)
or
the
multiple
family
districts.
the
time
of
trial,
at
least
seven
vacant
(r-5)
parcels
were
for
sale.
now
the
evident
shows
the
village
policy
was
to
use
(r-5)
classification
as
a
buffer
between
the
single
family
and
commercial
or
industrial
uses.
the
village
denied
the
zoning,
the
plan
commission
found
in
its
report
that
the
subject
property
would
not
constitute
such
a
buffer
because
there
was
nothing
to
buffer
it.
the
evidence
in
the
record
showed
clearly
that
the
proposed
development
would
have
an
adverse
effect
on
additional
property
values
in
the
neighborhood
of
10%.
the
property
on
drury
lane,
the
single-family
homes
which
back-up
as
indicated
on
our
land
use
exhibit
range
in
value
from
$50,000-70,000.
the
property,
south
of
euclid
avenue,
which
is
the
southern
boundary
of
all
single-family
range
in
the
area
from
$40,000-50,000.
property,
west
of
dryden
is
also
in
the
$50,000-60,000,
class
and
the
property
north
of
oakton
which
is
the
northern
boundary
cross
from
the
high
school
are
relatively
new
homes
built
within
five
years
of
the
trials,
some
homes
still
under
construction,
they
also
range
in
the
$60,000-70,000
class.
the
evidence
shows
also
that
the
subject
property
could
be
economically
developed
for
single-family
homes
at
a
price
range
comfortable
or
higher
to
the
existing
single-family
homes
in
the
area.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
kane(ph),
who
was
the
real
estate
manager
of
the
plaintiff,
testified
that
except
for
the
fact
that
the
clerics
of
st.
viators
wish
to
get
$300,000,
which
was
the
purchase
price
for
the
property.
the
property
could
have
been
develop
for
a
low
and
moderate
single
family
homes
which
were
then
eligible
under
the
so
called
235
program,
except
that
they
could
not
afford
to
pay
more
than
$200,000
for
the
price
--
price
for
single
family
purposes,
so
that
there
is
no
question
that
this
property
was
properly
zoned
in
terms
of
its
suitability.
the
surrounding
land
uses
all
the
criteria,
which
i
indicate
in
my
brief,
that
the
criteria
normally
apply
to
the
zoning
matters.
the
trial
court
found
that
the
village
was
motivated
by
a
legitimate
desire
to
protect
property
values
and
the
integrity
of
the
zoning
plan.
it
found
that
the
low-income
workers
do
not
have
a
constitutional
right
to
low
income
housing
either
where
they
work
or
else
where.
there
was
no
evidence
proving
discrimination
against
racial
minorities
from
the
low-income
persons,
generally,
and
the
trail
court
found
that
there
were
no
specific
violations
of
the
fair
housing
act
or
the
civil
rights
act,
and
that
there
was
no
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
court
of
appeals
as
i
have
indicated
found
that
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
should
not
be
disturb
in
an
essence
said,
that
the
villagers
--
reasons
for
rezoning
were
the
protection
of
property
values,
were
for
the
preservation
of
the
integrity
of
the
zoning
ordinance.
the
court
specifically
found
that
the
evidence
did
not
support
the
finding
that
the
villagers
administering
its
buffer
policy
and
discriminatory
matter,
found
that
the
trial
courts
determination
was
not
clearly
erroneous.
the
court
of
appeals
also
recognized
that
merely
because
racial
minority
has
constituted
a
higher
percentage
of
low
and
moderate
income
category,
did
not
mean
that
the
refusal
to
rezone
at
the
type
of
racially
discriminatory
effect
that
required
the
implication
of
a
compelling
interest
test.
but
to
my
mind,
illogically,
it
then
preceded
to
rely
upon
what
it
judicially
determined
was
the
segregated
housing
market
in
the
chicago
metropolitan
area
and
compelled,
and
applied
that
the
compelling
interest
test.
now
the
villagers’
position
in
this
matter
is
very
simple.
we
take
the
position
about
the
fact
that
the
zoning
ordinance
may
have
a
greater
impact
upon
the
poor
or
a
minority
group,
does
not
thereby,
invalidate
it
or
cause
it
to
be
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
evidence
indicated
that
in
the
standard
metropolitan
area,
that
is
a
six
county
area
around
chicago,
approximately
40%
of
the
blacks
who
resided
in
that
area
would
be
eligible
for
the
housing
which
was
proposed
here,
low
and
moderate
income
housing—the
so
called
lincoln
green
project.
there
is
no
evidence
that
anyone
has
ever
been
denied
housing
in
arlington
heights
because
of
their
race,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
answers
to
interrogatories
indicated
arlington
heights
was
the
first
community
in
north-west
suburban
area
to
adapt
a
fair
housing
ordinance.
mr.
d.v
zay(ph),
a
demographer,
who
testified
for
mhdc,
testified
that
based
upon
the
economics
of
the
situation,
approximately
5%
of
the
housing
units
in
arlington
heights
were
available
to
blacks
in
the
chicago
metropolitan
area,
and
that
--
if
housing
was
determined
solely
for
economic
reasons,
there
would
be
a
black
population
in
excess
of
3,200
blacks
in
arlington
heights.
this
indicates
to
our
mind
at
least
that
it
was
the
economic
situation
and
not
the
zoning,
nothing
that
the
village
of
arlington
heights
has
done
by
way
of
zoning
which
has
in
anyway
impaired
the
rights
of
blacks
to
live
in
arlington
heights.
we
believe
therefore
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
is
applied
one
set
of
zoning
criteria
for
so
called
white
housing,
and
another
set
of
criteria
for
housing
which
may
contain
black
or
poor
people.
we
believe
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
in
lindsey
v.
normet,
or
rodriguez
and
the
other
cases,
which
i
have
cited
in
my
brief,
there
is
no
fundamental
constitutional
right
to
housing,
and
that
the
court
erred
in
applying
the
compelling
interest
test.
the
proper
test,
we
believe
following
belle
terre
and
euclid
is
the
test
of
rational
relationship
to
a
permissible
state
objective,
and
we
believe
that
the
zoning
ordinance
bears
such
a
rational
relationship.
we
also
believe
that
under
the
criteria
which
has
been
established
for
the
decision
of
zoning
cases,
the
surrounding
land
use,
zoning
suitability
of
the
property
for
the
purposes
zoned,
the
presumption
of
validity
that
the
mhdc
failed
to
overcome
the
presumption
of
validity.
we
believe
that
the
court
should
not
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
legislative
body
or
that
the
federal
court
should
set
as
a
super
zoning
board.
the
ordinance
is
patently
reasonable,
i
think
that
your
honors,
will
determine
by
simply
looking
at
the
land
use
map
and
at
the
photographs
indicating
the
actual
uses
in
place.
the
ordinance
is
not
on
its
phase
or
in
fact
aimed
at
a
racial
or
economic
minority.
it
is
a
valid
exercise
of
legislative
discretion
and
it
should
not...
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
i
am
talking
about
the
arlington
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
a
failure
to
rezone.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
i
am
talking
about
the
village
of
arlington
heights,
zoning
ordinance
and
specifically
the
classification
of
the
subject
property
for
(r-3)
single-family
purposes.
this
zoning
has
been
in
existence
since
as
i
indicated,
the
first
zoning
in
arlington
heights,
this
is
not
a
failure
to
rezone.
this
is
not
the
dailey
cases,
this
is
not
kennedy
homes
case,
where
there
was
a
rezoning
to
keep
out.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
it
is
a
failure
to
rezone.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
yes
sir,
but
it
was
a
continuation
of
the
existing…
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
well
that
is
by
--
that
is
what
a
refusal
to
rezone
is
almost
by
definition,
is
it
not
a
continuation
of
existing
zone.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
as
it
existed
then,
and
as
existed
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
yes
sir.
now
we
also
believe
that
respondents
in
this
case
lack
expanding.
the
trial
court
held
that
the
two
blacks,
who
actually
testified
did
not
have
standing
to
represent
a
proper
class,
they
were
mr.
guthrie(ph)
and
mr.
ransom,
who
were
employed
at
honeywell,
neither
of
whom
had
ever
sought
housing
in
arlington
heights.
one
of
them
it
looked
at
want
ads.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
yes,
sir.
i
filed
a
motion,
originally,
to
have
the
case
dismissed
for
lack
of
standing.
my
motion
is
found
in
the
first
volume
of
the
appendix
on
page
20
and
21,
paragraph
four,
i
raised
the
question
of
standing.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
mrs.
maldonado
was...
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
she
lived
in
the
village
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
she
still
lives
in
the
village.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
no,
sir.
not
to
my...
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
not
on
the
record.
one
of
them
lives
in
evanston,
which
is
another
suburban
community
who
testified,
he
lived
there
with
his
mother
and
his
son
in
a
five-room
house.
his
mother
also
had
a
full
time
job
and
there
is
no
indication
even
qualified
with
respect
to
income,
and
he
commuted
45
minutes
to
arlington
heights.
the
other
gentlemen
lived
in
the
city
of
chicago
and
moved
further
away
in
order
to
buy
a
two
flat
in
chicago,
he
was
renting
out
one
apartment
for
$160
a
month,
i
believe,
and
he
resided
there
with
his
wife
and
child.
his
wife
was
also
employed.
there
was
no
evidence
that
either
of
them
had
ever
indicated
any
interest
in
housing
in
arlington
heights,
except
i
believe
mr.
guthrie
said
that
he
had
read
the
want
ads.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
no
sir,
they
did
not
hold
there
was
no
standing,
they
held
it
was
not
a
class
action.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
i
raised
the
standing
question
initially
in
a
motion
to
distract
and
dismissed,
predecessor
judge,
not
judge
mcmeelen,
judge
lynch,
who
had
the
case
originally
denied
my
motion.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
talk
about
it
at
all.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
i
talked
about
it
in
my
brief;
i
raised
it
in
my
brief.
i
argued
it
orally
and
i
also
argued
the
fact
that
mhdc
had
a
contract
purchase
conditioned
on
a
236
commitment,
236
program
was
dead
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
but
under
illinois
law,
the
so
called
clark
v.
city
of
evanston
case,
a
mere
contract
purchaser
does
not
have
standing
because
he
is
damaged.
he
does
not
get
the
zoning
and
he
walks
away.
so
i
argued
that
and
that
was
clearly
before
the
court
of
appeals,
they
did
not
touch.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
yes
sir,
i
believe
it
was
decided
at
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
it
was
not
decided
that
the
time
of
judge
lynch's
decision
and
i
rely
of
course
on
warth
v.
seldin.
it
is
our
position
that
the
failure
to
grant
the
rezoning
request
did
not
violate
the
civil
rights
act
to
the
fair
housing
law
or
the
fourteenth
amendment.
any
other
decision
would
have
been
spot
zoning
or
just
destroyed
the
integrity
of
our
zoning
plan.
the
property
is
clearly
suitable
for
single-family
purposes.
the
trial
court
also
found
that
there
was
no
discrimination
involved
in
this
case
and
the
courts
of
appeals
refused
to
set
aside
that
finding
and
fact.
we
believe
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
the
civil
rights
act
and
fair
housing
act
does
not
protect
purported
discrimination
based
upon
economics,
that
this
is
essentially
a
garden
variety
zoning
case
in
which
the
argument
is
made,
that
because
of
single-family
zoning,
poor
people
cannot
reside
on
that
property
and
that
there
is
a
percentage
of
poor
people
who
are
black,
and
therefore,
according
to
the
respondents,
this
is
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
this
argument
has
been
raised
in
this
court
in
other
connections,
san
antonio
school
district
case,
rodriguez
case,
lindsey
versus
normet,
james
v.
valtierra,
palmer
v.
thompson,
and
then,
the
court
of
appeals
of
various
districts
including
the
aseveto
and
the
mahaley
housing
authority
case.
we
believe
that
court
of
appeals
held
at
low
income
persons
have
special
privileges
to
have
low
income
housing,
if
there
is
a
possibility
or
the
higher
percentage
of
minorities
will
be
in
their
number.
we
do
not
believe
there
is
any
basis
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
this
position.
the
fact
that
the
zoning
ordinance
may
have
a
greater
impact
upon
the
poor
or
minority
group
clearly
does
not
invalidate
it.
most
recent
case,
which
i
have
cited
in
my
supplemental
brief
is
washington
v.
davis.
there
is
no
affirmative
duty,
we
believed,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
change
a
valid
zoning
ordinance,
absent
a
showing
of
purposeful
discrimination
simply
to
accommodate
low
income
people.
we
believe
that
milliken
v.
bradley,
and
washington
v.
davis
clearly
establishes
this
fact.
the
fact
that
as
i
said,
enforcement
in
ordinance
may
have
a
greater
impact
on
the
poor,
does
not
render
invalid
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
under
the
teachings
of
this
court;
court
in
james
v.
valtierra.
as
a
matter
fact
in
warth
v.
seldin,
which
we
rely
on,
on
the
standing
case,
i
believe
this
court
specifically
said
that
the
failure
of
low
income
people
to
reside
in
that
suburban
community
was
based
on
their
economic
situation
and
could
be
based
upon
their
economic
situation
and
not
upon
any
zoning
pattern.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
yes
honor,
i
believe
it
does
except
that
they
are
a
purchaser
subject
to
zoning,
subject
to
236
commitment
and
at
least
under
the
illinois
law,
such
a
party
does
not
have
a
right
to
challenge
because
they
have
no
property
interest.
quite
out
of
course,
that
the
owners
of
the
property
have
never
been
a
party
to
this
lawsuit,
the
clerics
of
st.
viator,
who
would
loose
presumably
$300,000
their
purchase
price
if
the
zoning
was
not
granted
or
the
commitment
was
not
received.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
yes
sir,
but
at
least
in
illinois,
it
is
typical
to
have
a
property
owner
enjoined
and
as
i
indicated
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
the
clark
case
had
the
situation
where
only
the
contract
purchaser
was
carrying
out
the
litigation
and
not
the
owner.
they
specifically
held
that
since
the
contract
purchaser
really
had
nothing
to
loose
by
a
way
of
the
failure
to
receive
zoning,
that
they
have
no
standing.
also
i
think
the
trial
court
pointed
out
that
merely
because
mhdc
was
organized
for
the
purpose
of
low
and
moderate
income
housing,
it
did
not
have
any
special
racial
characteristics
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
should
be
treated
the
same
as
any
other
corporation.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
it
is
not
require
as
a
matter
of
practice,
your
honor.
normally
when
property
is
rezoned,
it
is
rezoned
--
permit
a
specific
use.
in
this
instance,
it
would
have
been
a
so
called
plan
development
in
the
property
could
only
be
developed
in
accordance
with
the
specific
plan,
but
there
is
no
statutory
or
case
requirement
in
illinois
under
the
commitment
for
the
developer
to
go
ahead
and
the
trial
court
indicated
after
reaching
the
decision
on
the
merits.
it
would
be
reluctant
to
grant
any
relief
because
the
fact
that
236
program
was
dead
and
this
was
simply
a
rezoned
property
and
opened
it
up
to
any
of
the
uses
permitted
under
the
r-5
classification.
and
we
believe
that
the
ordinance
is
presumed
valid.
the
party
assailing
it
must
overcome
it
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
and
if
the
decision
of
legislative
body
is
fairly
debatable
to
court,
will
not
substitute
as
judgment,
and
there
of
course
euclid
v.
ambler
and
the
valtierra
case
hornbrook
law
on
that
proposition.
we
believe
as
i
have
indicated
that
the
respondents
lack
of
standing
to
bring
this
action
for
the
reason
that
these
are
non-residents,
not
residing
in
arlington
heights,
no
showing
that
this
was
a
class
action,
that
the
intervene
or
mrs.
maldonado
resided
in
arlington
heights.
the
other
intervene
are
the
north
west
opportunity
center
is
a
welfare
organization
funded
in
part
by
the
village
of
arlington
heights
and
part
by
the
federal
government,
who
are
there
to
take
care
of
the
low
income
people
in
chicago
metropolitan
area.
testimony
of
mr.
newton,
who
is
their
director,
was
that
at
the
time
of
trial,
there
were
188
low-income
families
in
arlington
heights
that
there
were
approximately
1500
in
the
arlington
heights
area.
many
of
them
were
spanish
surnamed
and
mexican,
originally
migratory
workers
who
had
settled
there.
mrs.
maldonado
clearly
does
not
zoned
out
of
the
village
because
mrs.
maldonado
lives
in
the
village.
therefore
your
honors,
it
is
our
hope
that
this
court
will
not
elevate
or
degrade
the
fourteenth
amendment
into
the
proposition
that
there
is
one
set
of
zoning
laws
for
all
people
except
the
poor
or
the
minorities.
the
village
of
arlington
heights
then
we
emphasize,
has
not
discriminated,
this
trial
court
so
found
that
as
the
matter
of
fact,
the
trial
court
was
correct.
there
was
no
evidence
of
discrimination.
the
village
of
arlington
heights
does
not
discriminate.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
last
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
yes
sir,
if
the
court
pleases.
i
would
point
out
first
of
all
that
the
village
of
arlington
heights
rejected
34
applications
for
multiple
housing,
which
did
not
involve
low
or
moderate
income
housing.
simply
because
they
did
not
meet
the
criteria
of
our
planning
principles
including
the
buffer
zone,
which
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
we
were
applying
in
an
non-discriminatory
manner.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
mr.
caruso
says
you
will
find
that
some
of
those
60
approvals
were
contiguous
to
single
family
zoning.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
that
is
the
whole
idea.
you
use
multiple-family
as
a
buffer
between
more
intense
and
single-family
development.
i
would
point
out
that
there
own
witness
mr.
d.v.
zay
characterized
arlington
heights
as
a
dormitory
suburb
and
it
had
the
least
industry,
the
least
commerce
of
the
communities
around
it.
so
when
mr.
caruso
says
all
the
jobs
are
moving
to
arlington
heights,
his
own
witness
does
not
believe
that.
now,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
record
showed
that
mr.
hansen,
the
village
manager,
and
mr.
kessler,
the
village
planner
were
prepared
and
offered
to
find
other
sites
for
mhdc
in
arlington
heights.
the
212-unit
project,
which
is
the
only
new
project
they
have
ever
built,
is
located
three
quarters
of
a
mile
away
from
arlington
heights,
much
closer
to
our
industrial
area
than
lincoln
green
is,
so
that
they
are
in
the
arlington
heights
area
now
and
they
have
no
problems.
now,
when
mr.
caruso
says
that
there
has
been
an
effort
to
zone
out
blacks
here,
this
is
just
not
the
fact.
we
have
permitted
over
6,000
apartment
units.
mr.
kessler
testified
that
those
apartments
range
from
a
$160
a
month
up.
there
were
over
6,000
apartments
and
an
additional
9,000
zoned
at
the
time
of
trial.
so
to
say
that
we
are
trying
to
zone
out.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
there
are
200,
your
honor,
according
to
the...
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
no
sir,
200
out
of
71,000
people,
there
are
200
blacks.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
i
cannot
answer
that,
your
honor.
i
do
have
a
copy
of
our...
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
yes
sir,
it
would.
some
of
them
are
in
single-family
homes,
but
the
village
is
zoned.
mr.
jack
m.
siegel
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
village
or
zoning
has
not
done
these.
what
mr.
caruso
is
really
arguing
is
we
have
a
different
set
of
zoning
laws
for
poor
people.
what
he
is
saying
is
that
arlington
heights
land
is
too
expensive
for
a
conventional
multiple
family
development,
except
for,
pardon
me,
is
too
expensive
for
235
or
236,
but
that
is
not
the
test
of
a
zoning
ordinance,
how
expensive
land
is?
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
i
ask
that
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed.
