unknown
speaker
where
is
the
arlington
heights
vis-à-vis
in
the
city
of
chicago?
unknown
speaker
is
it
west
of
evanston?
unknown
speaker
what
ordinance
are
you
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
this
was
a
failure
to
rezone.
unknown
speaker
so
what
ordinance
are
you
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
a
failure
to
rezone,
this
case.
that
is
what
they...
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
of
existing
zoning.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
continuation
of
the
prior
zoning.
unknown
speaker
mr.
siegel,
i
want
to
be
sure,
was
there
an
objection
on
standing
grounds?
unknown
speaker
let
me
be
sure
about
--
is
it
maldonado?
unknown
speaker
is
she
still
living
in
the
village?
unknown
speaker
have
any
of
the
other
individual
--
name
individual
plaintiffs
that
demonstrated
any
interest
in
housing
in
arlington
heights?
unknown
speaker
on
the
record?
unknown
speaker
mr.
siegel,
you
said
that
the
district
court
held
that
there
was
no
standing.
i
read
it
--
in
otherwise.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
you
raised
the
standing
question.
unknown
speaker
and
how
about
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
did
you
talk
about?
unknown
speaker
and
the
case
of
a
warth
v.
seldin
have
been
decided
here,
at
the
time
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
unknown
speaker
but
the
position
of
metropolitan
housing
development
corporation
here,
as
an
actual
applicant
for
rezoning
with
a
contingent
conduct
makes
it
a
little
bit
different
than
any
of
the
parties
involved
in
warth
v.
seldin,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
very
typical
in
this
kind
of
litigation
is
it
not
to
have
the
potential
purchaser
to
conduct
the
zoning
litigation
rather
than
this?
unknown
speaker
some
record
demonstrate
that
statement?
unknown
speaker
where?
unknown
speaker
the
distinction
about
discrimination,
where
is
the
court
of
appeals’
finding?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
not
went
washington
v.
davis
says.
the
washington
v.
davis
says
you
must
have
a
fact
which
certainly
was
found
by
the
court
of
appeals
here
and
you
must
have
intent.
the
district
court
found
no
intent
and
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
that
finding.
there
is
no
totality
of
the
circumstances
that
are
involved
in
it.
unknown
speaker
then,
you
are
arguing
that
the
court
of
appeals’
ruling
that
the
district
court’s
finding
was
not
clearly
erroneous
should
be
set
aside
by
this
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
specifically
said
it
would
not
set
aside
the
district
court’s
finding
that
there
have
been
no
discriminatory
intent.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
are
asking
us
to
set
aside
the
court
of
appeals’
affirmance
of
the
district
court’s
findings
that
there
was
no
purposeful
intent?
unknown
speaker
you
need
is
one,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
prevent
us
from
taking
all
any
of
the
considerations?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
been
said
that
it
was
zoning
law
was
passed,
that
was
it.
unknown
speaker
of
course
not,
i
mean,
you
say
that
the
man
is
going
to
have
--
where
a
nice
development
and
all,
euclid
says
that
means
nothing.
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
they
going
to
ride
herd
and
see
it
as
one
drop,
but
euclid
said
that
is
not
what
is
to
be
considered.
unknown
speaker
is
it
discriminatory
against
poor
people?
unknown
speaker
can
a
black
person
buy
one
of
those
vacant
homes
out
there
at
$60,000?
unknown
speaker
a
black
person
with
a
spanish
name,
buy
one
of
the
houses
if
he
has
got
$60,000?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
many
are
living
out
there
now?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
would
you
say?
unknown
speaker
how
many?
unknown
speaker
so
they
are
not
excluded,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
number
would
change
that?
unknown
speaker
what
number
would
change
that,
50%?
unknown
speaker
they
have
3500
negros
in
chicago;
they
can
buy
a
$60,000
house?
unknown
speaker
you
think?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
got
any
figures?
unknown
speaker
are
they
available?
unknown
speaker
you
just
want
this
particular
piece
of
property.
unknown
speaker
lease
zone.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
only
thing
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
does
every
unit,
does
every
village
in
this
country
have
to
have
low
cost
housing?
unknown
speaker
why
does
arlington
have
to
have?
unknown
speaker
presumably,
the
zoning
decision
was
made
with
awareness
of
all
those
factors,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course
if
there
had
been
an
application
here
for
high
rise
cluster,
high
rise
apartments,
they
might
have
been
able
to
show
that
there
could
be
three
or
four
times
the
tax
revenues
would
be
produced
either
by
present
zoning
or
by
your
proposed
zoning,
but
would
that
be…
unknown
speaker
you
are
emphasizing
the
benefits.
the
zoning
authority
was
obviously
aware
that
there
were
benefits
and
then
they
included
there
were
detriments
and
they
waived
them
and
made
the
decision,
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
caruso,
did
you
class
your
statutory
claim
as
a
separate
issue
in
the
lower
courts?
unknown
speaker
did
you
ever
specify
a
section?
unknown
speaker
and
is
that
one
of
your
issues
you
pressed
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
about
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
did
the
court
of
appeals
moved
directly
to
the
constitutional
issue
without
dealing
with
the
statutory
question
first?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think,
the
court
of
appeals
then
dealt
with
your
statutory
issue
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well
do
you
think
you
raised
the
--
do
you
think
you
named
the
statutory
issue
as
one
of
your
questions
in
your
petition
for
certiorari?
unknown
speaker
are
you
pressing
it
here?
unknown
speaker
and
to
sustain
the
judgment
below.
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
has
never
dealt
with
the
statutory
issue.
unknown
speaker
and
all
you
have
to
say
about
that
is
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
a
municipal
corporation
like
arlington
heights
can
be
discovered
by
the
provisions
that
you
are
talking
about
of
1968
act,
that
it
is
a
person?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
applies
to
a
public
municipal
corporation?
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
begins
discussion
of
the
legal
issue
by
saying
that
the
first
contention
that
you
raised
was
the
equal
protection.
they
do
not
say
the
only
contention
and
that
surely
implies
as
you
suggested
that
you
argued
the
statutory
issue,
which
they
had
not
referred
to
and
as
justice
stewart
suggested
by
all
standards
of
reading
an
opinion
that
means,
they
have
denied
your
statutory
ground,
rejected.
do
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
in
the
6,000
and
how
many
negros?
unknown
speaker
out
of
6,000.
unknown
speaker
you
are
talking
about
all
these
apartments.
unknown
speaker
how
many
negros
are
in
these
apartments?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
would
be
less
than
200,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
it
was
not
single-family
home?
