justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
respondent
in
this
case
the
housing
corporation
decides
to
build
in
the
village
of
arlington
heights,
illinois
a
townhouse
complex
for
low-and
moderate-income
tenants.
the
village
and
suburb
of
chicago
is
own
only
for
single
family
homes.
its
population
is
predominantly
white.
the
respondent
negotiated
a
purchase
agreement
covering
a
15-acre
site
upon
which
it
proposed
to
construct
the
project.
but
the
village
authorities
after
public
hearings
refused
to
rezone
the
property
from
single
family
to
multi-family
classification.
the
respondent
joins
our
individuals
instituted
this
suit
in
an
illinois
district
court.
they
alleged
that
their
refusal
to
rezone
was
racially
discriminatory,
violating
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
federal
fair
housing
act.
at
the
following
trial,
the
district
court
had
a
judgment
for
the
village
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed.
looking
solely
to
the
ultimate
effect,
the
circuit
court
viewed
the
denial
to
rezone
as
discriminatory.
in
washington
against
davis
decided
last
time,
we
held
that
official
action
is
not
invalid
solely
because
it
results
in
a
racially
disproportionate
effect.
we
held
that
proof
of
a
discriminatory
intent
is
required
to
show
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
in
this
case,
the
district
court
found
that
the
refusal
to
rezone
was
based
on
legitimate
land
use
considerations
and
was
not
racially
motivated.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
this
finding,
but
nevertheless
held
that
the
effect
of
the
refusal
was
determinative
as
this
is
not
in
a
court
with
our
decision
in
washington
against
davis,
we
reserved
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
remand
the
case
for
consideration
of
the
fair
housing
claim,
a
claim
not
resolved
by
the
court
of
appeals.
