justice
byron
r.
white
can
it
be
inferred
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
deal
with
the
statutory
claim,
they
certainly
mentioned
on
(a)(3),
i
am
reading
this
opinion
on
(a)(3)
of
the
appendix,
and
then
moved
right
on
to
the
constitutional
question
and
if
it
was
doing
anything
like
what
appellant
court
ought
to
do
or
any
court
ought
to
do,
it
was
by
moving
out
of
the
constitutional
question,
it
was
holding
that
there
was
nothing
to
the
statutory
claims,
was
not
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
cannot
either,
but
applying
normal
standards
of
that
court
is
supposed
to
do
that
would
be
their
logical
inference,
would
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
not
raise
your
constitutional
question
unless
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
do
so.
