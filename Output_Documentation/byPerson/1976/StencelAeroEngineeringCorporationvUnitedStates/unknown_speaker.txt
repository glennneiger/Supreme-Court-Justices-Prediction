unknown
speaker
donham’s
case
against
stencel
is
still
pending,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
and
donham’s
case
against
united
states
is
permanently
terminated.
unknown
speaker
he
received
the
compensation
for
his
injuries
from
the
united
states
correctly,
did
he
not?
unknown
speaker
is
that
because
missouri
law
which
is
applicable
here,
clearly
makes
this
an
action
in
tort
rather
when
in
place
high
contract
which
is
an
at
least
some
jurisdictions.
unknown
speaker
would
it
not
encompass
the
claim
if
this
were
a
contractual
action?
unknown
speaker
as
the
tort.
unknown
speaker
in
order
to
be
covered
by
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
and
in
some
jurisdictions,
this
law
has
been
changed
without
my
knowledge.
indemnification
is
thought
of
as
a
quasi
contractual
obligation.
unknown
speaker
and
in
jurisdiction
such
as
that,
you
would
not
have
a
claim,
would
you,
that
is
covered
by
the
act?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and
is
it,
if
i
may
follow-up,
is
it
clear
and
is
it
conceded
in
this
case
that
under
missouri
law,
this
is
a
claim
in
tort.
unknown
speaker
but
you
submit
that
the
missouri
law
is
plain.
unknown
speaker
rather
than
contribution?
unknown
speaker
that
you
are
the
minor
and
that
the
government
is
the
major
tortfeasor,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
and
that
you
therefore
entitled
under
the
missouri
law
to
100%
identification
of
any
liability
that
maybe,
you
may
have
incurred,
that
is
your
claim
under
missouri
law?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
tort
claim
under
missouri
law?
unknown
speaker
in
any
of
the
types
of
jurisdiction,
to
which
my
brother
stewart
has
just
referred,
stencel
and
its
dealings
with
the
government
could
have
bargained
for
a
contractual
indemnity,
could
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
sub
contractor
can
always
negotiate
that
kind
of
protection
with
the
prime
contractor
who
would
then
take
it
into
account
in
his
contract
with
the
government.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
there
are
mechanisms
readily
available
for
total
protection?
unknown
speaker
is
not
that
all
that
you
are
concerned
about
here?
what
are
the
concerns
do
you
have?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
other
concern
for
your
client
except
his
financial
protection?
unknown
speaker
can
you
really
suggest
that
the
government
has
walked
away
here
when
this
man
is
receiving
$18,000
a
year
without
any
showing
of
negligence,
but
merely
the
showing
of
the
injury?
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
conceded
that
that
is
a
responsibility
which
you
could
have
contractually
protected?
unknown
speaker
but
you
could
have
protected
through
the
prime
contractor.
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
missouri
law,
could
the
indemnity
claim
be
asserted
by
stencel
after
the
plaintiff’s
litigation
had
ended
and
suppose
plaintiff
prevailed
in
a
separate
suit
against
stencel,
would
stencel
thereafter
have
a
right
to
sue
an
indemnitor?
unknown
speaker
is
it
possible
that
even
if
you
lose
this
case,
you
could
reassert
your
claim
at
a
later
after
judgment?
unknown
speaker
is
it
conceivable
at
least
theoretically
that
you
might
be
able
to
sue
them
later
even
though
you
could
not
sue
them
in
the
same
action
on
the
concern
being
that
if
they
are
brought
into
the
same
action,
the
plaintiff’s
recovery
might
be
enhanced
by
the
fact
that
united
states
would
be
in
court
and
its
alleged
negligence
if
proved
in
that
case,
might
be
something
that
would
contribute
to
the
plaintiff’s
ability
to
recover.
unknown
speaker
could
not
you
–-
at
least
--
a
time
i
should
know
would
it
take
after
a
judgment
was
handed
against
you,
liability
to
this
airman,
for
you
to
sue
the
government
in
the
court
of
claims
under
contractual
theory,
of
course
contractual
theory.
unknown
speaker
right
and
under
a
contract.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that
perhaps
it
would
not
take
regular
ingenuity
to
frame
a
complaint,
stating
cause
of
action
onto
a
circumstance.
unknown
speaker
it
maybe
take
more
ingenuity
than
either
one
of
us
has
to
allow
you
to
prevail.
unknown
speaker
he
has
not
recovered
yet,
has
he?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
know
whether
he
will
recover.
unknown
speaker
there
is
the
lack
of
privity
between
stencel
and
the
united
states
in
the
contractual
area,
bar
the
united
states
from
a
suit
against
stencel,
assuming
hypothetically
it
could
show
that
the
injuries
to
donham
were
caused
by
stencel’s
negligence.
unknown
speaker
since
the
united
states
is
now
committed
to
paying
$18,000
a
year,
probably
for
the
rest
of
donham’s
life,
which
will
amount
to
a
very
substantial
sum,
is
the
united
states
barred
from
suing
stencel
on
a
claim
that
stencel’s
negligence
has
caused
this
huge
damage
to
the
united
states
government
for
which
it
must
pay
donham?
unknown
speaker
mr.
whalen
is
it
not
the
government’s
position
that
donham
cannot
sue
the
government,
he
cannot
recover,
right?
unknown
speaker
if
you
sue
on
his
behalf,
you
take
over
his
impediment.
unknown
speaker
what
is
wrong
with
that?
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
sue
if
you
do
not
sue
on
behalf
of
what
donham
against
you;
that
is
your
only
damages?
unknown
speaker
except
where
the
feres
case
says
particularly
that
you
cannot.
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
get
to
the
feres
case?
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
get
to
that
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
that
apply
if
this
man
had
sued
the
united
states
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
does
feres
is
apply
and
what
would
that
mean,
he
got
nothing.
unknown
speaker
but
under
this
way,
he
will
get
sum
from
the
government.
unknown
speaker
and
he
will
also
get
what
you
give
it?
unknown
speaker
and
which
the
government
will
then
have
to
give
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
there
had
not
been
this
accident,
could
you
have
sued
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
could
you?
unknown
speaker
how
could
you
have
sued,
on
what
ground?
unknown
speaker
if
nobody
had
been
injured,
could
you
sue
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
only
way
you
could
sue
is
because
a
serviceman
is
injured
as
the
only
ground.
unknown
speaker
as
a
result
of
the
united
states
tort,
right?
unknown
speaker
mr.
whalen,
in
your
cross
claim,
you
alleged
that
the
after
the
equipment
was
delivered,
it
was
in
the
custody
of
the
united
states
and
i
take
it
you
intend
to
prove
and
support
your
cross
claim
that
there
was
negligence
in
the
government
in
the
cure
and
maintenance
of
the
system.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
in
the
cross
claim,
it
was
dismissed…
unknown
speaker
you
would
draw
that
allegation.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
issue
at
the
trial
if
you
prevail,
what
evidence
be
put
in
as
to
whether
or
not
the
government
was
negligent
in
the
way
in
which
it
took
care
of
the
equipment
after
it
was
delivered.
unknown
speaker
would
not
jury
interpret
such
evidence
as
supporting
your
claim
by
the
pilot
against
united
states?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
theory
would
be
that
the
man
was
injured
because
something
was
defective
about
the
system
and
the
defect
was
created
by
the
negligent
maintenance
of
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
the
jury
would
be
instructed
that
if
that
was
because
there
be
no
recovery
at
all.
unknown
speaker
or
donham
against
united
states,
either
one?
unknown
speaker
the
united
states
under
the
federal…
unknown
speaker
right,
i
understand,
but
under
your
concept
of
the
trial,
all
three
parties
would
be
in
court,
arguing
before
the
court.
unknown
speaker
that
was
on
a
warranty
theory,
was
not
it
which
is
(inaudible)
at
any
event
it
is
not
tortuous,
an
applied
warranty
of
workmen
like
service
in
the
steve
and
ryan
contract,
was
not
it?
unknown
speaker
warranty
of…
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
go
back
for
a
second
of
the
allegation
in
the
cross
claim
about
the
negligent
maintenance.
how
does
that
support
a
cross
claim
as
opposed
to
being
a
defense
to
the
main
action?
unknown
speaker
so,
that
allegation
is
on
a
contribution
theory
as
opposed
to
an
indemnity
theory?
unknown
speaker
i
see,
but
you
told
us
earlier,
you
are
in
trouble
on
that
contribution
theory,
are
you
not?
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
a
more
doubtful
petitioning
in
respect
to…
unknown
speaker
alright.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
familiar
with
the
case
of
brooks
against
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
in
this
case
donham
had
simply
taken
the
plane
without
any
instructions
from
the
superior
and
gone
of
on
a
frolic
of
his
own,
such
that
the
feres
rational
would
not
have
protected
the
government.
now,
i
take
that
your
case
then
would
be
stronger,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
the
government’s
arguments
that
are
available
from
make
against
you
in
this
particular
case,
because
of
feres
would
not
be
available
to
them
in
the
brooks
situation.
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
only
obstacle
in
this
case
is
the
feres
doctrine,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
what
is
the
issue?
that
is
the
only
issue,
we
are
not
concerned
here
with
the
merits
of
your
claims
at
all,
but
the
issue
of
the
government’s
suability
is
an
issue
only
because
of
the
feres
case,
is
it
not
correct?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
other
reason?
unknown
speaker
mr.
whalen,
i
just
take
interrupt
but
your
double
recovery
argument,
i
just
do
not
understand
that.
you
are
not
going
to
be
liable
for
medical
expenses,
if
the
medical
expenses
are
all
paid
by
the
united
states,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
maybe
recover
those
from
you,
but
you
are
not
going
to
have
to
pay
them
to
the
plaintiff,
what
you
are
paying,
is
an
entire
amount
of
injury,
part
of
which
has
owed
to
the
government,
part
of
which
is
owed
to
the
plaintiff.
you
are
not
paying
for
the
same
injury
twice,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
are
right
on
the
facts,
they
will
not
prevail
on
that
law
suit,
will
they?
unknown
speaker
your
fourth
ground
is
not
a
matter
of
missouri
law.
unknown
speaker
i
could
understand
your
argument,
if
stencel
as
its
name
was
an
assignee
was
suing
as
assignee
or
an
assignee
by
operation
of
law
by
subrogation
then
he
would
not
be
asserting
the
serviceman’s
claim,
but
here
stencel
is
asserting
a
different
claim.
the
measure
of
damages
is
going
to
turn
out
to
be
the
amount
they
had
to
pay
donham,
but
it's
a
different
claim,
it's
a
different
theory
of
recovery.
it's
not
an
assignee
if
donham
noor
it
is
an
assignee
by
operation
of
law
by
subrogation.
unknown
speaker
it
is
...
unknown
speaker
then
your
argument
still
would
i
think….
unknown
speaker
stencel
is
not
any
order
from
the
government
in
the
sense
that
it
a
part
of
the
army,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
theory
of
passive
v....
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
is
it
correct
that
the
proof
of
this
case
stencel
would
have
to
prove
every
element
essentially,
but
donham
would
have
proved
if
the
tort
claims
act
had
not
been
barred
by...
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
suit
by
donham.
unknown
speaker
sue
the
united
states
and
suit
was
dismissed.
unknown
speaker
but
are
you
not
going
to
have
some
of
the
same
issues
in
the
litigations
between
donham
and
stencel
which
can
be
concededly
be
brought.
unknown
speaker
mr.
martin,
if
i
could
just
interrupt,
it
seems
to
me
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
suggested
that
if
their
defense
says
there
was
a
negligent
maintenance
breaks
in,
i
have
taken
to
put
in
precisely
the
same
evidence
to
show
that
it
was
united
states’
responsibility
whether
or
not
united
states
is
a
party.
unknown
speaker
for
what
reason
will
they
put
any
less
evidence?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
can
always
happen
in
anyway.
unknown
speaker
let
me
back
up
a
little
bit
here.
in
the
suit
which
donham
brings
--
will
try
against
stencel
whose
negligence
will
be
the
focus
of
the
evidence?
unknown
speaker
not
the
negligence
of
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
no
common
ground
necessarily.
unknown
speaker
between
the
proof
that
would
be
again
the
donham
against
the
united
states,
if
the
feres
case
did
not
block
it
and
donham
against
stencel,
no
one
will
be
concerned
in
that
case
about
the
negligence
of
the
united
states
on
the
plaintiff
side
really?
unknown
speaker
it
would
not
be
relevant
at
all.
unknown
speaker
but
you
can
have
factual
variations
all
over
the
law,
can
you
not,
in
this
type
of
case
where
you
got
a
clearly
injured
plaintiff
and
he
is
looking
for
as
many
solvent
defendants
as
he
can
to
sue
to
allege
some
claim
of
negligence
against
every
conceivable
person
who
make
him
keep
in
court.
so
that
just
because
your
particular
factual
variant
may
be
quite
different
from
any
case
that
might
be
brought
against
the
united
states,
it
does
not
mean
that
the
next
case
will
have
that
said
be
equally
far
distant
from
it.
unknown
speaker
and
if
he,
i
suppose
your
answer
would
be,
if
some
one
were
to
make,
while
all
of
us
say
it
would
be
an
extreme
argument,
that
congress’
fear
of
litigating
military
orders
was
so
strong
that
it
actually
intended
to
employ
an
exception
to
diversity
jurisdiction
so
that
a
federal
court
was
to
be
prohibited
from
entertaining
a
suit
by
donham
against
stencel.
your
reply
to
that
would
be
you
do
not
have
to
go
that
far
at
least
both
these
exceptions
come
out
of
the
federal
tort
claims.
unknown
speaker
prior
to
donham’s
discharge…
unknown
speaker
has
he
been?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
something
that
relates
to
it
i
think.
in
stencel’s
action
against
the
united
states
where
will
that
action;
how
will
that
fact
finding
be
made
by…
unknown
speaker
well,
court
or
jury?
unknown
speaker
court
or
jury?
unknown
speaker
it
is
only
a
court.
unknown
speaker
the
problem
is
that
the
tort
claims
act
incorporates
by
reference
the
state
law.
you
will
have
very
interesting
argument,
but
you
are
met
without
the
language
of
statute,
are
you
mot?
unknown
speaker
was
a
contribution,
was
not
it?
unknown
speaker
the
only
reason,
the
only
reason
stencel
can
see
you
at
all
is
by
virtue
of
the
waiver
of
immunity
contained
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act
which
says,
which
clearly
makes
the
united
states
liable
if
a
private
person
would
be
liable
to
the
claimant
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
a
mission
occurred
which
in
this
case
is
missouri.
that
is
the
reason
i…
unknown
speaker
what
does
mr.
whalen
have
to
say
about
that
in
response
to
your
question?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
he
responded
to
the
question
here
indicating
he
had
no
claim
under
state
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
would
be
for
the
merits
if
you
loose
here
and
that
would…
unknown
speaker
mr.
martin,
a
very
small
question.
the
pleading
refers
to
a
miller,
the
defendant
millers
manufacturing
company,
who
is
that?
