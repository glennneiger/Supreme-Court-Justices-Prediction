mr.
thomas
s.
martin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
congress
intended
that
the
same
litigation
that
is
barred
in
feres
would
be
nevertheless
be
permitted
if
brought
indirectly
by
a
third
party
plaintiff.
in
my
argument,
i
would
hope
to
touch
briefly
upon
four
principal
topics.
first
the
similarity
between
the
barred
feres
claim
and
the
claim
which
petitioner
seeks
to
bring
in
this
case
by
way
of
indemnity;
second,
the
propriety
of
applying
a
feres
immunity
against
the
third
party
manufacturer
has
not
received
compensation;
third
the
limited
scope
of
the
immunity
that
is
claimed
here
by
the
government
and
fourth
i
would
like
to
briefly
address
our
alternative
ground
for
affirming
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
namely
that
indemnity
will
not
be
permitted
in
the
absence
of
liability
running
from
the
united
states
to
the
injured
party.
now,
turning
to
our
first
point..
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
it
is
not
a
matter
of
missouri
law.
it
is
a
matter
of
federal
law.
our
first
point,
petitioner’s
cause
of
action
we
believe
is
identical
in
a
practical
sense
to
the
serviceman’s
claim
that
this
court
considered
and
rejected
in
feres.
now,
in
feres
the
executive
tricks
of
a
serviceman
was
killed
in
a
barrack’s
fire,
sought
to
recover
tort
damages
from
the
united
states,
and
the
claim
was
that
the
military
had
negligently
corded
troops
in
barracks
with
an
unsafe
heating
facility.
now,
in
griggs
and
jefferson
decided
with
feres,
the
claim
was
that
an
army
doctor
had
negligently
performed
medical
operations.
contrary
to
petitioner’s
apparent
understanding,
there
was
no
field
commander’s
order
involved
in
any
of
these
cases.
in
feres,
there
was
no
plaintiff
serviceman
going
to
point
a
finger
at
his
commander.
feres
had
died
in
the
barracks
fire
that
was
the
cause
of
action.
so,
feres
like
this
case
really
involved
another
party
stepping
into
the
place
of
the
plaintiff
and
bringing
a
particular
litigation.
now,
like
petitioners
here,
the
claimants
in
feres
based
their
cause
of
action
on
the
general
language
of
the
tort
claims
act
and
the
absence
of
any
specific
exceptions
applying
to
serviceman.
but
in
feres
the
court
demonstrated,
that
in
this
context,
in
military
context
a
cause
of
action
cannot
be
assumed
from
the
general
language
of
the
tort
claims
act.
to
find
out
congress’
real
intent,
the
court
turned
to
the
consequences
of
the
proposed
cause
of
action.
the
court
saw
adverse
affects
upon
military
discipline
from
the
litigation
of
injuries
arising
out
of
--
injuries
to
serviceman
under
orders
and
found
an
additional
tort
remedy
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
compensation
scheme
which
covered
those
injuries.
at
last
we
afforded
unlikely
that
congress
would
impose
the
varying
standards
of
state
law
upon
the
consequences
of
federal
military
actions.
the
court
denied
feres
claim
against
united
states
and
it
did
so
in
very
broad
language.
it
said
and
quote,
“the
government
is
not
liable
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
for
injuries
to
servicemen
where
those
injuries
arise
out
of
activity
incident
to
service,”
that
is
exactly
of
viability
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
now,
the
court
in
feres
appears
to
realize
it
was
making
a
difficult
judgment
with
respect
to
congress’
intent.
but
the
court
said
if
we
are
wrong
on
this,
then
congress
has
a
remedy.
it
can
change
the
statute,
but
in
the
25
years,
since
feres
was
decided,
congress
made
no
changes
in
the
statute
and
we
think
that
suggests
strongly
that
the
decision
to
preclude
litigation
in
this
area
was
in
fact
correct.
now,
the
nature
of
petitioner’s
claim
is
an
indemnity
claim
for
recovery
of
injuries
to
serviceman,
and
therefore,
the
subject
matter
of
its
claim
must
be
the
injury
to
captain
dunham.
captain…
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
it
is
not
a
assignee,
it
is
not
a
subrogation
case.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
that
argument
would
automatically
follow.
it's
a
little
bit
more
difficult
than
that,
but
we
suggest
that
sense
that
feres
must
have
relied
upon
the
natural
of
the
litigation
process
that
was
brought.
in
another
words,
the
court
seem
to
be
concerned,
at
least
it
has
interpreted
in
the
brown
case
and
munise(ph),
the
court
seems
to
be
concerned
with
the
affects
of
a
tort
suit
challenging
the
actions
of
military
officers
and
injuries
to
military
personnel
under
orders
and
it's
the
litigation
process
which
we
think
is
what
was
the
court
was
concerned
about.
now,
that
litigation
process
we
suggest
must
be
the
same
by
the
nature
of
indemnity
claim,
not
because
of
subrogation,
but
because
it
will
have
the
same
aspects.
let
me
speak
to
that….
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
that’s
exactly
right,
but
stencil’s
claim,
if
we
look
to
it's
cross
complaint,
is
that
the
united
states
was
negligent
in
causing
the
injury
to
captain
donham,
that’s
the
only
way
it
can
succeed
at
least
under
the
theory
that
has
in
fact
brought.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
theory
of
passive
v.
active
negligence
towards
captain
donham.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
exactly
that
we,
the
united
states
negligently
designed
or
negligently
maintained
this
ejection
system
and
as
a
result
we
caused
captain
donham’s
injury.
now,
captain
donham’s
suit
if
he
had
not
been
barred
would
have
been
exactly
the
same.
the
united
states
negligently
designed
or
negligently
maintained
my
ejection
system
and
therefore
it
caused
me
injury,
so
that
negligence
action
in
terms
of
its
theory
is
going
to
be
the
same.
as
justice
stewart
pointed
out
the
damages
are
going
to
be
the
same.
there
is
no
injury
as
justice
marshall
said.
there
is
no
injury
to
stand
so
independent
of
those
damages
to
captain
donham.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
do
not
see
how
it
could
avoid
that
burden
mr.
chief
justice.
donham
in
a
sense
would
have
to
show
that
there
was
a
duty
running
from
the
united
states
towards
captain
donham
and
that
somehow
we
negligently
performed
and
there
was
an
injury
to
captain
donham
because
they
shouldn’t
be
the
same.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
the
case
trotted
suit
by
the
donham.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
sue
the
united
states
on
exactly
these
allegations
and
the
case
would
be
dismissed
and
now,
we
are
going
to
have
if
stencel
prevails
the
exact
the
same
litigation
except
now
the
indemnity
brings
it
as
opposed
to
the
serviceman
himself.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
think
it
possible
that
we
could
have
some
of
those
of
issues.
i
think
it
also
possible
that
stencel
may
in
the
absence
of
a
third
party
recovery
possibility
settle
this
kind
of
suit.
it's
true
as
we
recognized
in
our
brief
that
there
could
some
inroads
on
the
policies
which
feres
menat
to
protect,
in
other
words,
feres
attempted
to
protect
the
military
from
getting
into
the
business
of
litigating
its
decisions.
there
will
be
no
determination
by
a
court
as
there
would
be
in
a
suit
by
stencel,
that
officer
jackson
negligently
failed
to
do
something
on
the
particular
day.
there
will
just
be
determination
if
it
comes
about
the
at
all
that
in
fact
stencel
did
not
cause
the
particular
injury
here.
we
think
that
significantly
different
if
you
have
kind
of
litigation
process
where
you
have
an
advocacy
situation,
a
military
officer
accused
of
negligently
performing
duty
i
think
the
court
feared
that
after
that
litigation
there
is
going
to
be
the
questions
about
the
impact
on
the
relationship
between
the
officers
who
testified,
the
impact
upon
on
the
confidence
of
the
officer
who
was
found
negligent,
impact
upon
the
confidence
of
the
other
officers
who
might
have
to
make
similar
judgmental
decisions,
impact
upon
those
who
have
to
respond,
the
subordinates
to
that
officer.
the
court
felt
that
congress
intended
to
exclude
this
litigation
and
again
congress’
failure
to
change
the
rule
suggest
to
me
at
least
that
the
court
was
in
fact
right.
so
while
we
recognized
that
unlike
feres,
the
form
of
plaintiff
here
is
a
corporation.
we
think
it
does
not
alter
the
more
fundamental
similarities,
the
subject
matter
of
the
litigation.
in
other
words,
an
injury
to
an
active
duty
serviceman,
bailing
out
of
an
f-100d
fighter
aircraft
was
he
was
under
military
orders.
that
is
the
same
question.
who
caused
that
accident?
the
theory
of
liability,
mr.
donham
and
stencel
both
say
it
is
the
united
states
that
caused
that
accident,
and
so
the
litigation
would
be
the
same.
litigation
process
would
be
attempt
to
place
that
responsibility
on
the
military
officers
who
made
the
decision
to
get
that
particular
ejection
system
or
maintain
that
particular
ejection
system.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
again,
i
say
i
think
it
is
possible
that
they
could,
but
of
course
we
would
not
be
a
party
to
the
suit,
so
they…
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
well,
first
of
all,
they
might
settle
suit,
that
is…
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
sure.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
think
that
it
could
be,
let
me
say
this
justice
stevens,
i
think
congress’
determination
which
this
court
found
in
feres
was
a
general
determination
to
avoid
this
kind
of
action
as
much
as
possible.
what
we
are
saying
really
is
that
stencel
can
now
bring
its
suit
that
would
undermine
some
of
the
feres;
rational
in
precluding
donham’s
suit
and
it
would
undermine
some
of
the
rational
in
precluding
stencel’s
suit
against
the
united
states.
but
i
think,
the
congress
in
establishing
the
rule
which
we
think
should
be
unitary,
as
to
both
serviceman
and
third
parties
was
looking
to
the
broad
scope
of
things
and
saying
that
in
general,
we
do
not
want
to
encourage
third
parties
against
whom
are
brought
to
join
the
united
states
in
every
case
and
to
engage
in
adversary
litigation
against
the
united
states.
i
think
congress
was
looking
to
that
broad
policy
and
applies
here.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
in
a
suit
that
donham
tries
against
stencel,
it
will
be
trying
to
prove
that
stencel
was
in
fact
negligent.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
not
the
negligence
of
the
united
states,
but
then
if
it
can
prove
that
plainly..
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
not
necessarily
it
is
a
common
ground.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
not
necessarily.
it
is
only
a
possibility.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
not
in
terms
of
plaintiff’s
side.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
that
is
correct,
but
again
i
say
theses
are
criticisms
that
really
apply
to
feres
v.
united
states.
in
feres
the
court
made
a
general
determination
that
congress
intended
generally
to
preclude
these
kinds
of
litigation.
now,
donham
sued
against
stencel
will
on
some
way
implicate
those
same
concerns,
but
i
do
not
think
that
undermines
congress’
intent
which
this
court
found
in
feres
in
which
the
congress
has
sustained.
it
would
be
somewhat
bizarre
i
was
to
say
to
allow
one
rule
with
respect
to
captain
donham
that
he
cannot
bring
the
suit
because
that
might
involve
litigation
process
constraint
to
military
and
then
let
stencel
do
the
exact
same
thing.
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
would
be
simply
analogous
to
preclude
the
serviceman
from
getting
his
recovery
for
his
injury
and
then
allow
a
third
party
to
have
that
exact
same
recovery.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
that
is
exactly
right
we
were
only
talking
about
federal
tort
claims
act.
i
would
like
to
stake
for
a
moment
about
the
propriety,
the
fairness
and
the
applying
the
federal
rule
to
a
third
party
government
contractor.
now,
in
feres
and
subsequently
in
the
united
states
vs.
demco,
this
court
found
the
presence
of
a
compensation
scheme
to
be
an
important
indicator
of
congress’
intent
to
preclude
tort
remedies.
compensation
statutes
are
almost
always
thought
of
substitutes
for
common
law
tort
remedy
by
the
injured
party,
but
another
function
of
a
compensation
scheme
is
to
limit
the
liability
arising
out
of
a
particular
activity.
the
language
of
this
court
in
cooper
stevedoring
vs.
kopke,
it
provides
a
protective
mantle
for
the
employer.
unlike
workman
compensation,
veteran’s
compensation
laws
provide
short
compensation
for
the
injured
party
and
a
limited
liability
for
the
united
states
and
this
protective
function
is
especially
important
here
because
this
is
an
enormously
dangerous
business
of
training
and
transporting
military
personnel.
the
compensation
scheme
we
think
really
represents
a
congressional
balancing
of
the
necessity
to
limit
cause,
but
the
duty
and
the
responsibility
to
perform,
to
provide
some
reparation,
an
adequate
reparation
for
these
servicemen.
now,
that
protective
function,
that
balancing
of
congress
would
be
just
as
frustrated
by
an
indirect
recovery
by
way
of
indemnity
as
it
would
be
by
a
direct
recovery.
we
think
it
is
not
likely
that
the
congress
intended
that
the
liability
of
united
states
would
be
measured
by
the
compensation
scheme
plus
whatever
addition
amount
might
be
passed
through
some
third
party
manufacturer.
the
fact
that
the
scheme
would
be
equally
violated
by
direct
or
indirect
recovery
suggests
to
us
that
fact
that
petitioner
is
not
a
serviceman,
does
not
make
any
difference
for
the
feres
result.
now,
the
petitioner
argues
that
enforcing
immunity
against
a
party
not
governed
by
compensation
scheme
is
unfair,
but
this
court
in
other
courts
have
enforced
protections
to
protect
mantle
of
a
compensation
scheme
against
third
parties
to
protect
what
again
cooper
stevedoring
called
the
a
result
inconsistent
with
the
balance
struck
by
congress.
the
commercial
setting
here
of
course
we
think,
especially
eliminates
any
unfairness
claim.
this
is
a
contract
buyer.
he
set
the
terms
of
his
relationships
by
way
of
contract.
we
think
the
obligation
should
be
fairly
limited
to
contract
in
this
context.
this
is
some
stranger
who
is
suddenly
injured
by
unforeseen
action.
the
company
risk,
first
of
all
we
think
stencel
will
not
be
held
liable
in
the
absence
of
its
own
negligence
but
if
it
is
that
is
the
commercial
business
risk
and
it
could
have
allocated
some
parts
of
its
price
to
the
purchase
of
insurance
or
to
self
insurance
and
may
in
fact
have
done
so.
so,
we
think
that
to
preclude
trot
indemnity
here
merely
means
that
those
risks
that
stencel
is
talking
about
will
continue
to
be
resolved
through
the
contract
price
or
other
contract
terms
rather
than
through
a
kind
of
litigation
that
congress
intends
to
preclude.
stencel
has
talked
about
the
reverse
situation,
the
unfairness
of
recovery
against,
that
united
states
could
bring
some
action
for
recovery
against
stencel.
as
stencil
realizes,
the
only
action
that
united
states
can
bring
is
for
recovery
of
medical
clause
under
section
2651
of
the
42usc
and
it
is
important
to
note
that
this
is
a
diem
minims
matter.
we
are
only
talking
in
that
statute
about
medical
clause
only
medical
clause
prior
to
discharge
ba
medical
clause
cannot
be
recovered
under
the
statute
under
2651c.
it
is
not
clear
at
all
that
that
statute…
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
prior
to
donham’s
discharge
only.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
it
is
in
the
appendix
as
attachment
to
petitioner’s
complaint,
across
the
plane.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
the
fact
finding
will
be
made
by
interrogatory
to
party
depositions.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
excuse
me.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
court
or
jury?
oh,
oh
under
tort
claims
act…
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
only
a
court,
no
jury
that
is
right.
i
would
like
to
mention
that
as
–
first
of
all
there
is
no
–
it
is
not
clear
that
this
statute
would
permit,
this
medical
statue
is
limited
as
it
is
would
permit
recovery
against
a
government
contract
who
was
in
not
exact
negligent
and
let
me
knows
that
the
air
force’s
policy
is
not
to
recover
even
medical
cause
against
a
government
contract
when
the
liability
of
that
contractor
is
based
upon
products
liability
or
non
negligence
theory.
so,
we
think
that
the
medical
cost
recovery
is
just
simply
is
too
diem
minims
and
hypothetical
to
obstruct
the
balance
of
fairness
here.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
third
point
and
the
limited
nature
of
the
immunity
that
we
do
claim
here.
stencel
claims
that
our
analysis
will
preclude
every
tort
action,
touching
the
military.
in
fact,
our
claim
od
immunity
is
very
narrow.
it
only
governs
situations
that
are
covered
by
feres
itself.
only
where
an
injury
is
to
a
serviceman
are
there
implications
for
both
the
compensation
scheme
and
for
military
discipline.
now,
because
our
understanding
of
congress’
intent
would
only
bar
suits
where
feres
applies,
in
many
instances
criticisms
are
really
addressed
to
feres.
stencel
argues
that
immunity
is
not
merited
here
or
they
might
be
civilian
personnel
involved
or
there
is
a
lots
of
deterrent
value
but
captain
donham’s
claim
is
barred
in
precisely
the
situation
because
congress
set
a
broad
rule,
it
did
not
require
an
inquiry
into
each
and
every
injury
action
to
determine
whether
in
fact
this
action
merits
in
someway
a
congressional
immunity.
it’s
notable
that
all
parties
to
this
litigation
seem
to
recognize
that
suit
will
have
an
important
impact
on
federal
interest.
in
other
words,
stencels’
claim
really
is
in
it
reply
brief
that
the
advantages
of
deterrents
will
somehow
outweigh
the
disadvantages
of
an
impact
upon
compensation
scheme
and
military
discipline.
but
that
is
really
a
policy
decision
which
we
think
should
be
reserved
for
congress.
we
think
the
situation
is
like
united
states
versus
gilmet.
if
you
remember
in
that
case
the
united
states
sought
to
bring
an
indemnity
action
against
one
of
its
government
employees
and
the
court
said;
will
that
kind
of
action
will
have
results
on
the
relationship
between
the
government
and
its
employees.
it
will
have
results
with
respect
of
fiscal
policy,
but
it
is
very
difficult
for
a
court
to
determine
exactly
what
those
impacts
would
be
and
the
court
denied
the
cause
of
action
for
indemnity
in
favor
of
the
united
states.
here
we
think
we
have
the
reverse
situation.
the
petitioner
seeks
to
bring
a
cause
of
action
is
going
to
have
to
have
an
impact
on
fiscal
policy
on
the
compensation
scheme,
on
the
military
discipline,
it
is
difficult
to
say
precisely
what
all
the
impacts
would
be,
what
all
the
variations
would
be,
but
this
is
really
a
policy
weighing
judgment.
if
congress
wants
to
change
the
rule
feres
and
permit
the
united
states
to
have
liability
for
injuries
to
serviceman,
congress
can
do
it.
we
think
that
this
is
not
an
appropriate
rule
change
for
the
court
to
make
at
least
under
the
teaching
of
united
states
versus
gilmet.
i
would
like
to
turn
in
briefly
to
the
alternative
ground
for
affirming
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
a
ground
that
does
not
rest
upon
the
military
context
at
all.
a
number
of
courts
of
appeals
have
held
that
neither
indemnity
nor
contribution
will
be
permitted
in
the
absence
of
liability
running
from
the
united
states
to
the
injured
party.
this
is
a
result
which
is
reached
by
majority
of
state
courts
in
workman’s
compensation
scheme,
but
where
the
direct
claim
of
the
injured
party
is
barred
by
federal
law,
we
think
and
the
courts
have
said
that
the
implications
of
that
bar
for
indemnity
or
contribution
should
also
be
decided
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
and
this
federal
rule
of
indemnity
would
preclude
indemnity
here
because
the
united
states
is
not
liable
to
the
injured
party
itself.
we
believe
that
this
rule
is
a
proper
one,
is
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
indemnity
because
indemnity
really
shifts
cause
among
viable
parties.
if
the
united
states
is
not
liable,
no
shifting
should
occur.
it
also
ensures
that
the
courts
will
not
commit
a
third
party
recovery
under
a
indemnity
theory
to
override
or
undermine
a
congressional
decision
to
impose
the
sovereign
immunity
bar
and
of
course
it
makes
fundamental
good
sense
here
where
recovery
would
impact
upon
important
federal
interests.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
agree
but
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history
which
has
set
up
yellow
cabs,
talks
in
general
about
the
yellow
cab
type
situation
where
wither
the
injured
party…
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
contribution
exactly;
either
party
could
have
sued
the
united
states
and
it
says
that
should
be
decided
as
the
matter
of
state
law.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history,
it
is
just
silent.
there
is
nothing
of
legislative
history
that
would
require
as
far
as
we
can
see
that
where
a
federal
law
has
barred
a
direct
claim
of
an
injured
party
that
the
implications
of
that
for
indemnity
should
be
decided
by
looking
at
state
workman’s
compensation
decisions.
that
just
totally
make
sense
and
i
think
the
courts
in
an
attempt
to
place
a
realistic
sense
of
interpretation
under
the
tort
claims
act
have
required
that
the
matter
be
decided
at
the
threshold
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
agree
the
language
is
very
difficult
but
to
bring
the
opposite
result
justice
stewart,
you
have
to
say
that
in
an
indemnity
action,
the
way
that
the
court
decides
is
to
look
at
what
the
meaning
of
the
missouri
state
workman’s
compensation
law
it
was
because
that
is
the
only
reference
point
and
that
just
cannot
be
true
and
so
i
think
a
reasonable
interpretation
is
that
that
language
is
the
general
rule
of
where
the
direct
power
arises
out
of
federal
law,
the
implications
must,
it
is
only
why
we
can
sense
out
of
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
he
did
not
respond
at
all
to
that
part
of
our
brief.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
that
might
be
true.
we
have
argued
in
our
brief,
as
you
know
he
has
no
claim
under
state
law
under
indemnity
at
all
or
contribution.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
that
would
be
exactly
right
and
the
reason
why
we
are
litigating
here
is
not
because
of
missouri
law
but
these
cases
arise
all
over
and
other
law
might
be
different.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
know
only
that
miller
manufacturing
was
also
nameed,
i
do
not
know
there
is
specific
status
but
i
think
my
opposition
probably
more
familliar
with
that.
thank
you.
