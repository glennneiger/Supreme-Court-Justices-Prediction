mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
claim
of
stencel
aero
engineering
corporation
against
the
united
states
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
whether
a
corporation
can
sue
the
united
states
for
the
government’s
negligence.
the
answer
to
that
is
clear.
the
united
states
may
be
sued.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
rather
whether
that
government’s
claim
must
be
barred
simply
because
the
damages
to
the
corporation
include
injuries
to
serviceman.
now,
the
issue
in
this
case
arises
in
the
following
factual
context.
in
1968,
stencel
aero
engineering
corporation
entered
into
a
contract
with
north
american
rockwell
corporation
to
upgrade
an
ejection
system
in
an
f-100d
fighter
aircraft
being
used
by
the
air
force.
in
1973,
when
captain
john
donham,
while
flying
one
of
these
f-100
fighter
aircrafts,
had
his
aircraft
catch
on
fire.
donham
ejected
using
the
system
of
stencel
aero
engineering
corporation
and
successfully
ejected
and
survived.
however,
he
was
injured
and
there
upon
filed
a
claim
against
both
the
united
states
and
stencel
in
the
eastern
district
of
missouri.
the
stencel
corporation
cross
claimed
against
the
united
states
claiming
that
the
negligence
towards
the
injuries
was
primarily
due
to
the
united
states’
negligence
in
the
provision
of
the
requirements,
specifications
and
components
which
were
used
by
stencel
manufacturing
the
system
which
was
installed
in
the
aircraft.
united
states
moved
to
dismiss
both
the
claim
of
donham
and
the
claim
of
stencel.
the
district
court
granted
both
motions
on
the
grounds
that
feres
versus
the
united
states,
a
decision
of
this
court
controlled.
donham
did
not
appeal.
stencel
did.
it
appealed
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals,
the
eighth
circuit.
however,
the
circuit
court
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
that
is
correct
your
honor.
to
review
over
the
briefs
that
had
been
filed
in
this
case…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
correct
your
honor.
he
received
compensation
of
about
1500
dollars
a
month
under
the
military
compensation
act,
and
he
is
still
receiving
those
payments.
the
review
of
the
briefs
in
this
case
indicates
that
the
united
states
does
not
really
dispute
that
the
claim
of
stencel
is
within
provisions
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
the
government
complains
about
the
ramifications
of
the
pie
or
rather
the
ramifications
of
committing
stencel’s
claim
in
this
case.
the
government
does
not
dispute
that
the
language
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
in
sweeping,
in
broad
terms
includes
the
claim
of
stencel.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes,
your
honor
in
part,
but
the
language
of
the
act
itself
encompasses
the
claim.
the
law
to
be…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
no
your
honor
that
would
be
governed
by
the
tucker
act.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
the
federal
tort
claims.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
in
some
jurisdictions,
it
is.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
if
i
would
not
–
if
it
is
not
claim
of
tort.
if
it
is
considered
a
contractual
claim,
i
would
not
have
a
claim
because
the
united
states,
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
only
waived
its
immunity
as
to
tort.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
it
has
not
been
disputed;
i
can
not
say
it
is
conceded,
but…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
i
submit
that
the
missouri
law
is
plain
on
indemnity
which
is
our
claim…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
we
have
a
problem
on
contribution
under
missouri
law,
but
we
are
claiming
indemnity
and
in
missouri
law
we
claim…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
that
is
right
your
honor
that
is
correct…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes
your
honor,
but
i
must
point
out
that
this
case
does
not
involve
the
contract
between
stencel
and
the
government.
this
is
a
contract
between
north
american
rockwell
and
the
government.
stencel’s
contract
was
with
north
american
rockwell,
but
to
answer
your
question,
yes
this
could
be
a
bargain
for
item
between
a
government
contractor
and
the
united
states.
of
course
if
stencel’s
claim
were
denied
in
this
case,
the
contractor
would
make
a
provision
to
increase
the
contract
price
to
cover
the
possibility
that
claims
to
arisen
out
of
injuries
to
servicemen
and
government
employees
or
claims
which
the
government
would
claim
it
is
been
immune,
so
the
contract
would
attempt
to
take
care
of
that
in
its
contract.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes,
your
honor
it
could.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
financial
protection,
yes
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
question…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
well,
in
this
case
--
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
that
is
all
my
concern
is
financial
protection,
however,
i
believe
that
this
court
has
a
broader,
broader
concern
and
that
is
that
the
government,
when
it
acts,
should
be
responsible
for
the
consequences
of
its
act.
so,
the
government
can
walk
away
from
its
responsibilities
to
a
government
contractor,
especially
where
the
victim’s
of
that
negligence
are
going
to
be
government
employees
and…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
well,
yes
your
honor,
it
has
not
walked
away
from
donham,
but
has
walked
away
from
its
responsibilities
to
stencel.
the
government
in…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
i
could
have
contractually
protected
if
i
had
a
contract
with
the
government,
but
i
do
not.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
if
your
honor
i
had
that
sufficient
bargaining
power
with
the
general
contract,
that
could
have
been
(inaudible)
in
the
contract.
we
are
not
in
this
case
dealing
with
contractual
arrangements.
we
are
dealing
with
the
tort.
if
the
government
does
not…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
under
missouri
law,
it
depends
upon
who
the
indemnitor
would
be.
if
the
indemnitor
had
no
–
in
either
case
under
missouri,
there
is
no
requirement
of
underlying
liability
between
a
third
party
defendant
and
a
plaintiff.
after
the
action
was
over
under
missouri
law,
yes
stencel
could
sue
the
third
party
defendant
or
the
indemnitor.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
if
i
could
sue
the
united
states
which
is
the
issue
in
this
case,
yes
i
could.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes,
your
honor
i
could
if
the
basic
issue
which
is
before
the
court
was
decided
in
my
favor,
the
answer
is
yes,
i
could
bring
a
separate
action
against
united
states.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
i
have
no,
if
i
had
that
right,
it
is
the
only
place,
i
could
go,
not
only
the
court
of
claims,
but
we
do
not
have
the
contractual
relationship
your
honor,
in
this
case
between
stencel
and
united
states
and
it
is
only
those
actions
which
i
permitted
in
the
court
of
claims
as
i
read
the
tucker
act.
i
could
not
sue
in
this
case
the
united
states
in
the
court
of
claims.
court
of
claims
is
the
only
court
that
has
jurisdiction
since
what
i
would
be
claiming
for
is
more
than
$10,000.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
and
under
a
contract,
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
i
think
it
would
take
more
ingenuity
than
i
have
because
we…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
the
government
does
not
really
dispute
that
the
stencel’s
claim
is
within
the
provisions
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
or
that
it
falls
within
any
of
the
exceptions
and
more
critically,
the
government
has
not
found
one
piece
of
legislative
history
indicating
that
congress
intended
to
exclude
a
claim
such
as
stencel’s.
the
government
rather
says
in
effect
what
about
the
ramifications
of
allowing
stencel’s
claim.
essentially
the
ramifications
go
into
two
categories.
one,
it
would
disrupt
the
military
compensation
system
which
was
setup
by
the
congress.
let
us
look
at
that
military
compensation
system.
military
compensation
system
is
essentially
a
quid
pro
quo
between
the
government
and
the
serviceman.
the
serviceman
gives
up
his
right
sue
the
united
states
for
damages
due
to
the
united
states’
negligence
and
in
return
receives
an
ample
ensured
remedy.
of
course
stencel
is
not
a
part
of
that
bargain,
seeks
no
benefit
and
in
this
case,
it
can
be
–
if
you
take
the
government’s
position,
it
is
this.
if
stencel’s
claim
is
barred
or
should
be
barred
simply
because
one
party
to
that
bargain,
the
serviceman
is
suing
stencel
for
damages
and
the
other
party
to
the
bargain,
the
united
states
of
america
says
that
that
claim
should
be
barred.
in
other
words,
the
government
is
saying
that
the
bargain
does
not
hold
for
donham,
he
can
sue
stencel,
but
please,
our
bargain
do
not
permit
anyone
to
sue
us.
that
is
essentially
the
government’s
position.
i
say
to
this
court,
that
the
moment
that
donham
steps
out
of
the
shoes
and
sues
stencel,
he
has
disrupted
the
military
compensation
system.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
no,
your
honor.
this
a
third-party
claim.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not.
but
if
he
does
and
we
claim
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
then
we
have
a
right
to
indemnity
and
in
terms
of
judicial
economy
having
one
court,
one
fact
–
rather
two
fact
finders
in
this
case,
but
one
litigation
to
determine
all
the
rights
of
the
parties
of
an
interest
in
litigation
that
is
stencel,
donham
and
united
states
of
america
as
well
as
the
other
defendants
in
this
case,
we
are
not
here
concerned
with…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
the
united
states
could
introduce
its
evidence
and
say
that
our
specifications,
our
components,
our
requirements
were
perfect
and
we
exercised
due
care
in
making…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
well,
your
honor
i
think
in
part
it
is
barred.
i
think
that
question;
the
question
of
equitable
recoupment
was
raised
before
this
court
in
the
standard
oil
case
many
years
ago
and
i
think
this
court
found
in
that
case
which
i
believe
is
analogous
that
the
government
could
not
sue.
but
congress
has
passed
a
statute
which
permits
the
government
to
recover
for
the
expenses
of
the
medical
services
which
were
provided
to
donham
in
this
case
and
in
this
case
they
are
considerable.
so
that
in
that
event,
if
all
things
go
badly
for
stencel,
donham
will
collect
his
military
compensation
payments.
stencel
will
pay
damages
to
donham.
donham
will
recover
twice
and
the
government,
whom
we
claim
is
the
principal
culprit
in
the
accident
that
is
involved
in
this
case,
will
not
only
–
not
be
sued
for
damages
by
stencel,
but
what
we
committed
to
come
into
court
and
get
that
from
stencel,
the
medical
payments
that
it
provided
to
donham
under
the
congressional
statute
and
we
think
that
is
an
outrageous
situation.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
donham
could
not
--
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes
your
honor,
if
you
sue…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
we
are
not
suing
on
his
behalf.
we
are
suing
on
our
own
behalf.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
well,
there
may
also
be
the
attorney
fees,
but
essentially
that
will
be
the
principal
damages,
but
we
are
not
suing
on
his
behalf.
it
is
this,
your
honor
that
we
have
suffered
damages.
the
character
of
the
damages
means
nothing.
we
have
to
pay
money
to
someone.
we
the
corporation
have
suffered
damage
and
we
claim
that
the
united
states
is
responsible
for
that.
if
donham
was
a
private
citizen
and
suffered
an
injury
and
we
sued
stencel
and
(inaudible),
there
is
no
question
and
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
in
missouri,
we
would
be
entitled
to
sue
the
united
states.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
your
honor,
the
feres
case…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes,
your
honor,
i
will
address
it
now.
the
feres
case
was
basically
suit
between
a
serviceman
against
the
united
states,
the
injury
sustained
incident
to
his
service.
this
court
found
in
a
military
compensation
system,
a
congressional
intent
that
congress
intended
that
that
kind
of
claim
by
serviceman
against
the
united
states
was
not
contemplated
by
congress
when
it
enacted
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
that
is
all
the
case
holds.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
he
would
get
nothing
from
the
government
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
he
will
get,
he
has
gotten
his
military
compensation
system…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
he
will
get
what
we
are
held
responsible
for…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
the
government
will,
if
we
can
prove
our
case
and
of
course
the
case
of
stencel
against
the
united
states
is
a
different
case,
different
facts,
different
theories
of
liability.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
we
the
corporation
on
our
claim
against
the
united
states
is
a
different
claim,
it
is
different
in
consequence…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
if
there
had
not
been
this
accident,
we
would
have
no
reason
to
sue
the
united
states.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes,
your
honor,
we
could…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
if
a
civilian
–
if
we
had
suffered
damage…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
no
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
the
only
reason
we
can
sue
your
honor,
if
your
honor
please,
is
if
we
had
suffered
damage.
it
is
different…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
that
is
what
our
claim
your
honor
as
the
result
of
the
united
states
tort.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
as
a
matter
strategy,
i
probably
will
not
contend
that
your
honor
because
i
think
that
will
only
lead
me
into
a
contribution
situation
in
which
i
do
not
think
i
am
as
sound
as
i
am
in
indemnity.
what
i
am
claiming
is
pre-delivery
negligence…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
not
yet
your
honor,
i
will
consider…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
i
may
submit
evidence
if
i
can
establish
that
that
will
support
some
claim
of
stencel
against
united
states…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
i
am
sorry
i
do
not…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes,
that
would
be
a
defense
of
my
claim
to
donham.
i
would
say
the
cause
of
this
accident
was
the
negligence
of
the
united
states.
that
i
believe
would
be
a
defense,
it
would
be
an
absolute…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes
your
honor,
donham
against
stencel.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
well,
your
honor
donham
has
already
been
dismissed
as
far
as…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
correct
your
honor.
this
court
has
addressed
the
problem
of
workmen’s
compensation
in
two
prior
cases;
the
ryan’s
and
steve(ph)
case
and
the
treadwell
construction
case
in
which
the
compensation
system
was
not
deemed
to
be
a
bar
to
a
claim
over.
it
is
exactly
the
same
situation,
if
you
except
as
i
believe
you
must,
that
the
military
compensation
system
is
a
form
of
work…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
i
am
trying
to
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
the
existence
of
the
compensation
system,
not
to
the
theory
of
the
defendant
against
the
third
party
defendant,
it
is
correct
that
the
theory
of
a
defendant
against
the
third
party
defendant,
i
believe
was
a
breach
of
workman
like
service
or
some…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
warranty,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
if
i
am
able
to
establish
that
the
substance
of
law
of
missouri
permits
contribution,
then
i
will
attempt
to
shift
some
of
the
liabilities
for
which
we
maybe
found
in
our
suit
involving
donham,
will
attempt
to
shift
some
of
that
responsibility…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes
your
honor,
if
the
missouri
law
applies,
but
of
course
we
have
not
had
a
full
development
of
the
case
in…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes
your
honor,
if
missouri
law
applies.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
the
military
discipline
is
the
second
rational
which
the
government
relies
upon
as
a
serious
ramification
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
military
discipline
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case
and
can
not
be
an
issue
in
this
case.
this
is
a
case
of
rising
out
of
a
government
procurement
activity.
the
government,
however,
fears
that
a
decision
in
favor
of
stencel
in
this
case
would
involve
the
orders
of
a
field
commander
and
place
his
judgment
and
impair
his
judgment
in
the
exercise
of
his
duties.
however,
if
a
field
commander’s
order
is
involved
in
a
case,
it
is
not
involved
in
this
case,
but
if
it
is
involved
in
another
case,
and
i
was
defending
the
defendant,
i
would
make
sure
that
that
field
commander
would
be
brought
into
court
by
subpoena
deposition
as
another
method
and
i
would
confront
in
that
suit,
the
plaintiff
donham
and
his
military
commander.
so,
that
if
the
government
is
afraid
of
confrontation
as
i
think
this
court
was
concerned
in
one
of
its
prior
decisions,
if
they
are
afraid
of
a
confrontation
between
a
field
commander
and
the
plaintiff’s
serviceman,
this
suit
wants
decision
against,
stencel
will
not
stop
that.
if
the
government
order
is
relevant,
i
will
bring
in
the
field
commander,
i
will
put
that
order
into
issue
and
so
the
situation
as
it
exists
does
not
--
the
denial
of
stencel’s
claim
in
this
case,
does
not
change
that
situation.
the
orders
of
a
military
commander
can
be
brought
into
question
and
the
congress
so
intended.
when
the
congress
passed
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
it
clearly
defined
employee
to
include
military
serviceman
acting
in
line
of
duty.
it
also
provided
a
specific
exception
that
is
if
the
claim
arises
out
of
the
combating
activities
of
the
united
states
in
time
of
war,
the
united
states
cannot
be
sued
and
does
not
waive
the
sovereign
immunity.
we
do
not
dispute
that…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes
your
honor,
i
have.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
the
brooks
case,
yes
your
honor,
there
would
be
no
problem,
the
brooks
case
would
control
the
situation.
donham
could
sue
the
government
and
he
could
sue
us,
if
he
claims
on
our
ejection
systems
did
not
work
properly.
we
on
the
same
facts
would
bring
in
the
government
and
of
course
the
question
of
underlying
liability
would
not
be
an
issue
because
there
would
be
no…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
we
do
not
believe
it
is
an
obstacle,
but
that
is
the
obstacle
which
is
the
government
has
placed
in…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
no
other
reason,
that
is
correct
and
we
think
that
the
feres
case
is
simply
a
case
of
a
serviceman
against
the
united
states
and
even
if
some
commentator
say
that
is
really
an
exception
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
it
should
be
treated
as
an
exception
and
that
is
as
this
court
has
held
many,
many
times,
the
broad
sweeping
language
indicates
a
broad
way
of
sovereign
immunity
and
the
exceptions
to
that
a
broad
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
should
be
narrowly
construed.
it’s
the
philosophy
that
has
been
expounded
by
this
court
many,
many
times.
if
however,
the
issue
of
a
field
commander’s
order
does
become
an
issue
in
the
case,
if
it
is
that
important
decision,
we
believe
that
congress
has
provided,
provided
for
that
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
when
it
provided
an
exception
for
discretionary
function,
that
is
this
is
an
important
decision
making
and
the
government
is
protected
in
its
important
government
decisions
and
if
a
decision
we
maintain
is
not
important
enough
to
be
protected
by
the
discretionary
function,
then
it
is
not
important
enough
to
bar
a
claim
like
stencel’s
against
the
government
when
the
government
has
the
negligent
and
responsible
for
the
damages
that
maybe
sustained
by
stencel
in
this
case.
finally,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
conclude
the
ramifications
which
would
occur
if
stencel’s
claims
were
denied,
stencel’s
claims
against
united
states
were
denied.
first
of
all,
there
would
be
a
double
recovery
by
donham
because
the
government
would
not
worry
about
a
double
recovery.
it
would
not
suffer
the
consequences
of
a
double
recovery,
but
as
i
mentioned
earlier
that
would
stand
in
the
government’s
negligence,
the
government
could
still
under
that
congressional
statute
come
in
and
get
from
stencel
the
expenses
of
the
medical
expenses
incurred
in
treating
donham.
the
government
in
this
case
is
in
affect
saying
that
with
respect
to
our
negligence
we
are
not
responsible.
we
want
to
be
immune
from
the
consequences
of
our
act.
on

our
brief,
in
footnote
4,
the
government
quite
candidly
states,
we
owe
no
duty
of
care
to
stencel.
your
honor,
we
are
saying
that
government
owes
a
duty
of
care,
just
of
any
private
person,
every
private
person,
every
citizen
has
an
obligation
to
every
other
person
to
exercise,
to
care.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
well,
your
honor,
yes,
i
am
saying
that
under
the
congressional
statute…
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
no,
your
honor,
but
the
government,
the
government
whom
i
am
claiming
is
responsible
for
this
accident,
is
going
to
be
entitled
under
this
congressional
statute,
to
sue
stencel
to
pay
for
the
medical
cause
of
treating
donham.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
that
is
correct,
they
will
not.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
thank
you,
mr.
whalen,
mr.
martin.
