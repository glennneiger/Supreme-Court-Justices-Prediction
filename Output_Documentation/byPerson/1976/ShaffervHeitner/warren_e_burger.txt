chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
75-1812,
shaffer
against
heitner.
mr.
reese,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
think
the
statute
eliminates
the
whole
range
of
special
appearance
to
part
of
the
defendant
to
contest
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
or
for
any
other
purpose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
statute
is
applicable
to
any
and
all
kinds
of
lawsuits?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
has
to
be
in
the
court
of
chancery
though,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
has
to
be
inequitable
claim,
so
it
is
not
any
claim.
it
is
any
equitable
claim,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
not
equitable,
therefore
to
an
ordinary
tort
suit,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
one
is
only
in
the
court
of
chancery
and
delaware
still
has
the
division
between
chancery
and
block,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
mr.
justice
white
i
think
that
depends
on
whether
fuentes
against
shevin
really
continues
to
be
viable.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
against
mistake
of
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
think
you
have
two
independent
grounds
for
winning
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
at
least
two
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
the
hearing
be
directed
to
--
to
what
will
be
the
hearing
directed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
the
function
of
the
special
appearance
was
is
not,
to
guard
against
to
that
possibility?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
maschio,
did
i
pronounce
your
name
correctly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
i
ask
you
this
before
you
proceed?
what
if
contrary
of
the
facts
in
this
case?
what
if
they
were
a
bona
fide
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
property
of
the
defendants?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
whose
property
was
it,
contrary
to
the
facts
in
this
case
in
delaware
and
under
delaware
law,
if
there
is
a
serious
question
or
if
a
question
is
raised
or
the
potential
of
being
raised,
as
to
whose
property
it
really
is?
is
there
any
provision
in
delaware
law
for
the
defendant
to
come
in
and
make
a
special
appearance
and
say
sorry
this
is
not
my
property?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
let
us
say
it
is
not
even
stock,
let
us
say
it
is
an
automobile.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
in
this
case,
one
of
the
defendants
had
in
fact
validly
transferred
his
shares
of
stock
to
his
nephew,
who
is
not
a
defendant
and
had
validly
done
so
before
this
attachment
or
sequestration
whatever
you
call.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
but
on
the
books
of
the
transferrations
it
still
showed
that
the
defendant
was
the
owner.
would
he
be
given
any
opportunity
under
delaware
law
to
come
in
and
say
you
cannot
bring
me
in
this
lawsuit
because
this
is
not
my
stock?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
one
reads
the
statute
there
is
no
opportunity
for
a
hearing
on
that
sort
of
an
issue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there
is
the
situation
in
this
case,
have
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
the
statute
is
valid
you
have,
but
if
it
is
not,
you
have
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
your
position
that
you
are
entitled
to
have
this
issues
resolved
at
the
outset,
that
it
is
a
due
process,
that
you
have
directed
to
due
process
to
have
this
issue
resolved?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understood
your
position
the
way
that
you
loose
your
constitutional
right
to
have
the
case
tried
in
a
proper
forum,
and
the
delaware
is
not
the
proper
forum,
is
that
your
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
are
saying
that
this
thompson's
(ph)
choice
is
one
that
the
provisions
of
due
process
should
guarantee
that
you
should
not
have
to
make.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
75-1812,
shaffer
and
others
against
heitner
to
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
chief
justice
