mr.
michael
f.
maschio
yes,
you
did.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
present
use
of
the
delaware
sequestration
statute
in
the
case
at
bar
has
deprived
these
appellants
of
their
fourteenth
amendment
rights
under
the
united
states
constitution.
the
appellee
arnold
heitner
is
attempting
secure
access
to
a
forum
so
that
this
case
may
proceed
on
the
merits.
jurisdiction
is
the
appellee’s
sole
concern
and
that
is
all
that
this
case
is
about.
in
this
respect
the
seizure
in
the
case
at
bar
is
quite
different
from
the
seizures
involved
in
recent
attachment
cases
decided
by
this
court.
i
am
of
course,
referring
to
sniadach
and
fuentes
and
the
cases
which
have
followed
those
very
important
decisions.
in
those
cases,
‘in
personam’
jurisdiction
over
the
defendant
already
existed.
here
the
delaware
statute
can
only
be
used
if
the
defendants
are
nonresidents
of
the
state
of
delaware.
in
addition,
in
those
attachment
cases,
the
purpose
of
the
attachment
was
to
secure
or
to
obtain
property,
security
for
the
underlying
judgment.
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
appellee
has
no
interest
in
the
property.
as
soon
as
the
appellants
appear,
their
property
will
be
released.
now,
throughout
the
appellant’s
argument,
they
have
maintained
that
the
procedures
used
in
this
case
are
fundamentally
unfair
and
the
traditional
notions
of
fair
play
and
substantial
justice
have
been
violated.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
you
question.
the
issue
as
to
who
has
owned
the
stock?
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
i
can
answer
that
question
by
just
saying
that
there
are
procedures
in
delaware,
builds
in
equity
exist
in
delaware,
that
can
only
had
take
place
in
the
hypothetical
situation
which
is
not
before
this
court
where
there
has
been
at
transfer
of
the
stock.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
i
know
the
answer
with
respect
to
stock.
i
am
not
sure
with
respect
to
an
automobile.
as
far
as
stock
is
concerned,
it
seems
to
me
that
delaware
courts
have
recognized
that
a
suit
in
equity
is
the
appropriate
procedure
whereby
all
of
the
claimants
who
claim
that
they
have
interest
in
the
stock
can
be
brought
before
the
court
in
one
particular
proceeding,
so
that
the
ownership
interest
of
all
the
parties
can
be
resolved.
in
addition,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
where
stock
is
involved
the
transferor
is
really
transferring
stock
in
violation
of
a
court
order
and
just
cannot
warrnat
title
for
that
stock
to
the
transferee.
the
federal
courts
have
recognized
the
billing
interpleader
which
also
serves
the
function
of
bringing
all
parties
before
the
court.
this
is
an
equitable
proceeding
and
i
think
that
it
gives
sufficient
safeguards
to
the
possible
danger
that
may
exist
if
there
is
a
dual
situs
to
the
stock
certificate
as
exists
in
the
case
that…
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
before
the
attachment?
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
well,
then
at
that
point
there
would
be
no
stock.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
i
think
he
could,
i
think
he
can
bring
an
equitable
suit
in
doubt.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
no,
there
is
not,
but
referring
to
case
law
in
the
state
of
delaware
which
does
provide
for
equitable
proceedings
to
basically,
resolve
the
question
of
ownership.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
pardon.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
yes,
he
would.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
well,
it…
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
in
this
hypothetical
situation,
i
cannot
think
of
any
way.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
he
would
have
to
come
to
delaware.
now,
i
would
like
to
return
back
to
the
fairness
argument
because
i
think
that
that
is
very
important
in
this
case.
it
should
be
pointed
out,
and
i
will
point
it
out
that
this
is
a
derivative
action
and
is
brought
against
offices
and
directives
of
a
delaware
corporation.
the
number
of
shares
that
the
plaintiff
owns
is
meaningless
because
he
is
bringing
this
suit
in
a
representative
capacity.
the
appellants
in
this
case
have
willfully
violated
an
order
of
the
district
court
and
have
been
found
to
be
in
contempt
of
court.
civil
and
criminal
sanctions
have
been
imposed
upon
the
corporation
and
the
corporation
has
been
required
to
pay
a
fine
of
$600,000
as
the
result
of
the
activities
of
certain
of
these
appellants.
it
is
alleged
that
these
appellants
have
engaged
in
a
continuous
course
of
legal
conduct.
there
has
been
violation
of
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
the
district
court
and
i
have
indicated
the
fines
and
sanctions
that
have
been
imposed
upon
them.
certainly,
these
losses
should
be
recovered
by
the
delaware
corporation.
the
corporation
shareholders
and
the
public
at
large
have
a
right
to
rely
upon
the
performance
of
fiduciary
duties
by
offices
and
directors
of
a
corporation.
in
this
sense,
this
is
not
a
private
suit.
it
is
a
public
suit.
it
is
a
derivative
action.
there
is
a
policing
function
involved.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
no,
the
wrongdoing
took
place
probably,
most
probably
out
on
the
coast.
it
had
to
do
with
discriminatory
bus
lines.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
that
could
have
been
the
possibility,
yes.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
i
am
not
sure
if
it
is
a
better
procedure.
first
of
all,
as
you
know,
a
hearing
on
a
minimal
context
is
a
very
difficult
situation.
i
mean
you
have
to
take
the
ties
and
connections
with
the
(inaudible)
procedures
in
the
court
and
i
think
that
for
all
practical
purposes,
jurisdiction
would
have
been
much,
much
more
difficult
to
obtain
under
that
type
of
a
situation.
moreover,
there
is
nothing
inherently
wrong
with
the
fact
that
under
our
system
of
federalism,
the
two
jurisdictions
could
have
sufficient
contacts
with
the
proceedings
so
that
the
case
could
go
forward
in
both
the
jurisdictions.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
at
this
point,
but
i
think
that
we
have
gotten
most
of
the
defendants
before
the
court
who
are
involved
in
this
situation.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
yes,
we
believe
that
we
have.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
of
course,
i
understand.
that
is
why
we
are
here.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
again,
my
client
owns
one
share
of
stock,
but
i
did
point
out
the
fact
that
this
is
a
derivative
action
and
is
brought
on
behalf
of
not
only
himself
but
all
other
shareholders
in
a
similar
situation.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
so,
it
may
well
be
that
there
are
shareholders
…
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
it
is
for
several
years,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
i
think
this
is
the
only
suit
of
this
nature.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
they
have
many
shareholders,
i
do
not
know,
thousands
of
shareholders.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
hundreds
of
thousand.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
the
merits
are
very
important.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
well,
i
am
arguing
the
merits
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
that
this
is
a
public
lawsuit.
it
is
not
a
private
lawsuit.
you
can
talk
about
the
fact
that
mr.
heitner
has
one
share
of
stock
from
now
until
doomsday,
it
is
not
going
to
change
the
fact
it
is
a
derivative
action
and
it
is
brought
on
behalf
of
all
shareholders
similarly
situated.
now,
even
the
court
believes
in
the
theory
of
a
public
suit
of
this
nature,
it
does
not,
but
the
point
is
that
this
is
a
derivative
action
and
that
there
is
a
public
function
involved
here.
there
is
a
policing
function
involved
here
and
i
think
that
that
is
an
important
distinction.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
it
was
not
your
honor,
that
i
know,
but
the
record
does
not
shed
any
light
on
it.
i
would
like
to
continue
on
the
fairness
argument
and
i
like
would
to
point
out
that
the
appellant’s
authorities,
the
appellant’s
authorities
in
this
case
as
regulated
of
course
by
delaware
law,
it
is
certainly
appropriate
for
delaware
to
construe
its
own
corporate
laws.
i
feel
that
this
is
an
important
public
function
which
we
must
concern
ourselves
with.
in
addition,
several
states,
in
particular
states
of
south
carolina
and
connecticut
have
enacted
special
statute
subjecting
non-resident
directives
to
suit
within
the
state
of
incorporation
as
a
result
of
activities
which
they
have
engaged
in,
in
the
course
of
their
performance
of
their
duties
as
directives
of
a
corporation.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
i
did
not
hear
you,
can
you
repeat
the
question,
and
i
did
not
hear,
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
i
really
do
not
think
it
is
required
in
that
type
of
a
situation.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
oh!
i
did
not
say
that,
i
certainly
do…
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
i
do
not
think
so
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
in
that
circumstance
no.
i
feel
that
the
purpose
of
the
delaware
statute
is
to
acquire
jurisdiction.
it
is
not
to
hold
the
property.
it
is
not
attempting
to
reverse
the…
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
alright.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
when
i
belive
if
a
defendant
is
a
resident
of
the
state
of
delaware
the
statute
does
not
apply
because
the
statue
can…
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
well,
it
is
very
hard
to
speculate
on
facts
that
are
not
before
--
the
nature
of
the
claim…
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
oh!
no,
we
are
not
saying
that
at
all.
we
feel
that
there
is
a
provision
for
a
hearing
in
this
case.
in
point
of
fact
the
trial
is
a
hearing
of
this
case,
the
trial
is
hearing
of
this
case…
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
no,
well
yes
may
be
in
some
circumstances
we
do.
it
is
not
a
hearing
in
the
sense
that
there
are
live
people
before
the
court
and
witnesses
are
being
--
the
testimony
is
being
taken.
first
of
all
the
appellants
can
come
into
this
court,
into
the
delaware
courts
and
challenge
the
procedures
involved
in
connection
with
the
seizure
of
property.
they
can
say
that
too
much
property
was
seized,
and
therefore,
a
review
would
have
to
be
made
of
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
to
see
whether
based
on
the
merits
of
the
complaint,
a
sufficient
amount
of
property
had
been
seized
in
ordered
for
the
sequestration
statute
to
be
solemnly
used.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
well,
delaware
has
a…
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
well,
we
know
what
interest
the
state
of
delaware
has
because
the
delaware
supreme
court
has
felt
that
it
did
have
an
interest
in
this
proceeding
and
so
stated
in
its
opinion.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
no,
there
is
not.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
well,
one
of
the
interests
that
delaware
has
that
it
is
in
a
unique
position
to
decide
issues
concerning
its
own
corporate
law.
i
feel
that
it
is
perfectly
appropriate
for
delaware
to
construe
on
corporate
law,
particularly
where
allegations
of
wrongdoings
of
offices
and
directors
of
a
corporation,
incorporated
within
delaware
are
being
called
to
task
for
their
activities,
that
is
one
interest
which
delaware
has
in
this
proceeding.
in
addition,
i
think
that…
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
pardon.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
that
is
true.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
yes,
the
fact
is
that
well
yes
that
would
be….
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
it
is
no
more
fictional
than
some
of
the
other
statutes
or
some
of
other
decisions
which
indulge
in
the
fiction
of
implied
consent
or
have
implied
presence
within
a
jurisdiction
for
the
purposes
of
jurisdiction.
i
do
not
think
it
is
any
less
fair
for
the
court
to
assume
jurisdiction
based
on
the
fact
that
there
is
property
within
the
jurisdiction.
delaware
has
other
ties
with…
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
right.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
well
this
goes
back
quite
away…
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
not
that
far,
no.
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
under
our
system
of
federalism;
the
state
of
delaware
has
enacted
corporate
laws
which
contain
numerous
advantages
for
incorporating
within
that
jurisdiction.
these
advantages
include
the
generous
indemnification
and
insurance
provisions
which
have
been
enacted
by
the
state
of
delaware
to
induce
capable
and
responsible
businessmen
to
assume
the
duties
and
hardships
of
corporate
directorship
of
a
delaware
corporation.
also
consistent
with
our
system
of
federalism,
delaware
has
sought
to
counter
balance
these
liberal
corporate
revisions,
and
its
corporate
law
by
enacting
a
sequestration
statute
which
asserts
the
function
of
many
cases
calling
corporate
offices
to
account
for
their
activities
in
connection
with
the
operation
of
their
performance,
their
duties
of
a
delaware
corporation.
these
defendants
keenly
as
they
are
aware
of
the
benefits
of
incorporating
within
delaware
must
be
deemed
to
have
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
sequestration
statute,
and
in
effect
i
am
suggesting
that
they
have
not
probably
waived
any
objection
to
the
operation
of
the
statute
in
the
case
so
far.
i
think
that
the
court
must
concern
itself
with
the
facts
which
are
before
this
court.
the
appellants
have
constantly
made
reference
to
where,
in
other
situations,
the
operation
of
the
statute
may
possibly
prove
a
hardship.
those
facts
and
those
circumstances
are
not
before
the
court.
here
we
review
the
question
of
fairness
in
the
context
which
these
appellants
have
with
state
of
delaware.
i
do
not
feel
the
traditional
notions
of
fair
play
and
substantial
justice
have
been
violated.
it
may
be
other
situations,
where
the
application
of
the
statute
is
monotonous,
but
these
appellants
lack
standing
to
raise
issues
and
constitutionality
of
the
stature
based
upon
facts
which
are
not
before
this
court.
i
would
like
to
–
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
i
know,
i
have
that
in
my
brief.
i
would
like
to
point
out
a
response
to
that.
it
is
my
understanding
and
i
may
be
mistaken
here
and
that
only
the
state
of
new
york
has
a
provision
and
certain
federal
court
decisions
where
a
special
appearance
is
permitted.
i
know
for
a
fact
that
the
state
of
new
york
has
a
provision
for
special
appearance.
i
have
not
made
a
survey
of
the
laws
of
the
jurisdictions.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
not
that
i
know,
but
that
doesn’t
mean
it
doesn’t
exist.
i
would
like
to.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
yes
that’s
right.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
that’s
the
standard
procedure
in
quasi
in
rem
proceedings.
it
doesn’t
change
the…
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
that
is
right.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
i
believe
there
are
cases,
but
i
do
not
have
those
–
right
now.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
and
that
is
the
procedure
is
delaware.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
right
and
that
is
the
procedure…
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
i
have
a
good
counsel.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
special
appearance,
i
just
like
to
point
one
thing
out
that
there
are
some
benefits
in
the
procedure
which
has
been
enacted
by
delaware.
by
requiring
a
general
appearance
in
order
to
defend,
you
do
eliminate
the
possibility
of
multiple
lawsuits
and
i
think
that
is
something
to
be
considered.
also
delaware
has
enacted
in
the
statute
and
it
is
case
law,
safeguards
in
the
sense
that
if
there
is
a
general
appearance,
the
claims
which
can
be
asserted
against
the
appellant,
cannot
go
beyond
the
four
corners
of
the
complaint.
in
other
words,
no
new
causes
of
action
can
be
interjected
into
the
action
by
the
virtue
of
the
fact
of
the
general
appearance.
so
these
are
two
facts
which
i
think
the
court
should
be
aware
of
with
respect
to
this
particular
type
of
procedure.
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
to
the
recent
supreme
court
cases
dealing
with
requirements
of
the
hearing.
i
think
we
touched
upon
some
of
this
in
earlier
discussions.
we
have
maintained
in
this
case
that
the
procedures
involved
are
consistent
with
the
one
of
these
criteria
and
a
postponing
notice
in
a
hearing
is
justified.
we
based
that
position
basically
on
the
case
of
ownbey
v.
morgan
and
the
citation
of
those
cases
in
fuentes,
sniadach
and
calero-toledo
cases
before
this
court
in
which
those
cases
were
cited
for
the
proposition
that
attachment
for
the
purposes
of
obtaining
jurisdiction
in
state
court
has
always
been
a
basic
and
important
public
interest
justifying
seizure
without
prior
notice
and
hearing,
that
is
also
another
interest
which
the
state
of
delaware
has
in
this
proceeding.
we
feel
that
the
delaware
statute
serves
us
very
important
function.
the
public
interest
is
also
served
because
of
the
–
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
i
understand
that
the
basic
thrust
of
the
ownbey
case
is
as
i
have
just
quoted
it
that
it,
that
attachment
for
the
purposes
of
obtaining
jurisdiction
in
the
state
court
has
always
been
a
basic
and
important
public
interest,
justifying
seizure
without
the
benefit
of
prior
notice
and
a
hearing.
that
is
all
that
i
limit
holding
in
the
ownbey
case.
i
do
not
condone
the
requirements
of
special
bond…
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
that
would
be
(voice
overlap)
and
i
do
not
think
that
that
issue
would
be
decided
the
same
way
today.
however,
the
ownbey
case
has
been
cited
by
this
court.
now,
i
do
not
know
what
this
court
had
in
mind
when
it
was
deciding
the
ownbey
case
and
fuentes,
sniadach
and
calero-toledo…
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
on
that
narrow
issue
of
the
special
bond
requirement.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
which
was
the
issue
in
that
case,
however…
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
no
i
never
rely
upon
the
pronouncement
in
the
ownbey
case
that
attachment
is
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
jurisdiction.
in
state
court
it
has
been
recognized
as
the
basic
important
public
interest
justifying
seizure
without
prior
notice
and
hearing.
now,
i
am
not
really
relying
on
ownbey.
i
am
really
relying
upon
the
reaffirmation
of
that
principle
in
fuentes,
in
sniadach
case
in
the
calero-toledo
case.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
your
honor,
i
think
we
all
need
guidance
on
this
point.
i
really
think
that
we
only
guide
this
on
this
point
and
i
can't
tell
this
court
what
it
meant
when
it
cited
those
cases
in
its
decision,
but
it
has
been
interpreted
as
being
a
reaffirmation
of
the
ownbey
case.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
no
i
don’t
believe
so...
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
that’s
all
we
are
interested
in
your
honor,
and
that’s
the
reason
why….
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
yes
it
does.
it
is
a
completely
different
situation.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
i
think
it
is
good,
i
think
it
is
good
because
it
goes
to
the
issue
of
–
it
goes
to
many
of
the
issues.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
the
plaintiff
can
get
a
judgment
in
this
case
only
in
two
methods.
one
if
it
revels
on
the
merits
of
the
case
and
that
would
imply
a
general
appearance.
two,
there
is
a
default.
there
the
judgment
would
be
limited
to
the
amount
of
the
property
sequestered,
but
it
is
not
an
absolute
default
of
judgment.
we
have
to
go
through
the
procedures
of
an
inquest.
we
have
to
prove
that
our
case
has
a
prima
facie
merit
and
we
have
to
show
that
there
has
been
damage
which
is
not
unusual
in
our
system
of
jurisprudence.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
well,
it
is
automatically
unless
the
party
who
has
seized
the
stock
can
show
a
special
need
for
the
withholding
of
the
stock
until
the
judgment
has
been
rendered,
and
automatically
the
stock
would
be
released,
unless
a
special
application
is
brought
by
the
party
who
has
sequestered
the
stock,
asking
for
it
to
be
withheld
during
the
continuation
of
the
lawsuit.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
i
would
rather
suspect
that
that
would
be
one
of
the
considerations
of
the
court
–
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
no
it
is
an
automatic
release
unless
a
special
application
is
brought.
a
new
proceeding
has
to
be
the
brought
by
the
party
who
has
sequestered
the
stock
and
a
sufficient
showing
has
to
be
made
that
there
is
a
reason
for
withholding
the
stock
further,
but
the
basic
thrust
of
the
statute
is
for
jurisdictional
purposes.
it
has
been
construed
that
way
it
has
been
utilized
that
way,
in
the
state
of
delaware,
and
i
really
think
that
that
is
the
basic
thrust
of
the
statute.
now,
we
talked
briefly
about
the
question
of
a
hearing.
i
think
that
again
it
is
important
to
distinguish
this
case
from
the
recent
attachment
cases.
of
course,
and
again
mr.
heitner,
the
appellee
has
no
claim
to
the
sequestered
property.
there
is
no
danger
that
this
property
will
be
depreciated
or
wasted.
there
is
no
wages
or
consumer
goods
at
issue.
there
are
no
vendor’s
liens
on
the
property,
all
of
which
could
involve
in
the
attachment
cases.
i
think
that
this
goes
to
the
question
of
what
type
of
the
hearing
is
required
and
what
is
the
purpose
of
an
immediate
post-seizure
hearing,
or
a
hearing?
what
will
be
determined
at
that
hearing?
the
only
point
that
has
to
be
established
under
the
terms
of
the
delaware
statute
is
the
fact
that
the
appellants
are
non
residents
of
the
state
of
delaware
and
that
they
have
property
within
the
state
of
delaware.
now,
the
hearing
on
the
merits
is
not
illuminated.
the
hearing
on
the
merits,
we
have
touched
upon
that.
how
the
merits
can
be
discussed
by
the
court
in
the
event
that
the
delaware
sequestration
procedure
itself
was
contested
on
the
grounds
that
too
much
property
had
been
withheld
and
also
there
is
the
trial
of
the
action
which
is
a
hearing.
i
think
that
under
the
circumstances,
you
have
to
look
at
what
the
property
interest
is
and
what
the
function
of
the
hearing
would
be
and
under
these
circumstances
i
think
that
the
sufficient
safeguards
exist
within
the
delaware
statute
to
cover
this
point.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
you
are
asking
me
to,
well…
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
i
don’t
believe
it,
that
is,
well
yes,
that’s
true,
(voice
overlap)
on
statute
but…
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
that
is
the
argument.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
our
argument
is
that
there
is
property
within
the
jurisdiction
and
that
is
a
valid
basis
for
the
exercise
of
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction.
our
further
argument
is
that
if
the
doctrine
of
international
shoe
and
hanson
and
denckla
is
said
to
apply
in
this
case,
we
meet
those
qualifications.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
oh
no,
not
by
the
fact
of
owning
property,
by
the
fact
of
owning
property
and
by
the
fact
that
delaware
has
a
substantial
interest
in
this
controversy,
by
the
fact
that
this
is
a
derivative
action,
by
the
fact
that
the
appellants
have
ties
with
the
jurisdiction
and
that’s
why…
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
yes
it
has
ties
through
the
corporation.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
it
is
a
very
important
tie.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
yes
that
and
the
property.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
no,
the
corporation
exists
in
the
state
of
delaware
and
has
a
(voice
overlap)
that
is
a
tie.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
yes,
all
of
those
things
we
are
trying
to
marshal
to
show
that
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
whether
or
not
you
say
the
international
shoe
doctrine
applies
or
not,
or
whether
or
not
you
say
that
this
is
strictly
a
quasi
in
rem
proceeding,
we
meet
the
qualifications.
this
is
not
the
case…
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
well,
delaware
does
not
have
a
long
arm
statute
and
so
that
makes…
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
that
is
correct
we
do
not
have
a
statutory
basis
for
the
‘in
personam’
jurisdiction
argument
based
on
a
minimum
context.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
yes
probably
if
the
breathe
of
the
statute
was
as
broad
as
the…
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
no
i
am
not
sure,
no
i
am
saying
that.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
well
i
do
not
know
what
the
breathe…
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
delaware
does
not
have
a
long
arm
statute
and
i
think
that
this
statute
is
more
conducive
to
securing
access
to
a
forum
and
as
long
as
that
situation
is
not
unfair
and
i
think
that
no
due
process
violation
has
occurred.
now,
it
may
well
be
that
the
imposing
of
a
minimum
context
theory
in
a
quasi
in
rem
proceeding
will
be
more
restrictive
than
that
which
exists
in
the
present
time
and
i
don’t
know
if
the
court
wants
to
go
that
far.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
maybe
i
don’t
think
it
through
all
the
way,
may
be
the
case
does
not
long
here,
but
i
thought
because
of
the
constitutional
arguments
it
was
appropriate
that
this
case…
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
quite
frankly
i
am
not
sure
any
answer
to
that.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
probably
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
that
is
very
interesting.
mr.
michael
f.
maschio
yes,
i
would
appreciate
that.
i
think
i
have
covered
all
the
points
i
wanted
to
cover
and
i
thank
you
for
your
time.
