unknown
speaker
that
is
always
been
in
delaware
rule?
unknown
speaker
mr.
reese,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
instead
of
stock
certificates,
one
of
the
defendants
had
his
brother-in-law
drive
his
car
to
the
state
and
the
car
was
seized?
unknown
speaker
that
is
only
a
nominal
bond
of
$1,000,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
reese
on
that
point,
supposing
delaware
amended
its
statute
to
require
that
before
the
order
issued,
there
would
be
a
probable
cause
hearing,
it
would
be
ex
party,
and
maybe
served
notice,
but
the
defendant
would
not
–
may
not
come,
would
that
cure
the
defect
in
the
statute?
probable
cause
to
show
there
is
merit
to
the
complaint.
unknown
speaker
will
it
make
the
statute
any
less
unfair?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
delaware
still
insisted
that
you
submit
the
‘in
personam’
jurisdiction,
in
order
to
defend
the
case,
you
would
have
the
same
argument
in
that
respect.
unknown
speaker
nobody
in
this
case
was
a
resident
of
delaware.
unknown
speaker
nobody.
unknown
speaker
any
hearing.
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
the
underlying?
unknown
speaker
it
would
not
be
directed
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
is
a
property
of
the
defendant?
unknown
speaker
that
was
conceded
under
delaware
law
it
is,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
property
of
the
defendants
within
the
jurisdiction
of
delaware.
unknown
speaker
under
delaware
law
that
is
–
there's
no,
the
hearing
therefore,
in
other
words,
there
is
no
dispute
about
that.
so,
the
hearing
would
not
be
directed
to
that
issue,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
and
so
to
what
it
would
be
directed?
unknown
speaker
in
preventing
the
losses,
that
is
the
basic
loss.
unknown
speaker
which
is
the
probable
cause
hearing,
it
is
a
fentes
hearing.
unknown
speaker
but,
could
he
not
come
in
and
enter
an
appearance
and
be
permitted
to
defend
without
risking
a
judgment
in
excess
of
value
the
property?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
were
any,
where
that
was
not
the
case
other
than
delaware?
unknown
speaker
other
than
just
having
property?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
he
would
have
to
come
to
delaware?
unknown
speaker
which
is
just
what
you
want
and
what
he
does
not
want?
unknown
speaker
and
he
would
not
have
to…
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
way
that
he
could
protect
his
interest
without
coming
to
delaware?
unknown
speaker
so,
he
is
still
would
have
to
come
to
delaware.
unknown
speaker
mr.
maschio,
as
i
understand
the
facts
there
are
28
individual
defendants
who
are
responsible
for
all
this
and
this
wrongdoing
took
place
was
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois
or…
unknown
speaker
and
could
they
not,
could
not
jurisdiction
have
been
obtained
over
the
entire
group
of
28
instead
of
just
21
if
the
action
had
been
brought
where
the
wrongdoing
took
place?
unknown
speaker
and
that
could
have
been
a
better
procedure?
unknown
speaker
and
delaware
can
not
go
forward
as
to
seven
of
the
defendants
at
all.
unknown
speaker
you
have
been
addressing
the
merits
of
this
case,
how
many
shares
of
stock
does
your
client
own?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
how
long
has
your
client
owned
that
one
share
of
stock?
unknown
speaker
how
many
other
stockholders
of
this
corporation
have
asserted
the
same
claims
that
you
have
said
in
your
complaint?
unknown
speaker
how
many
stockholders
does
a
greyhound
corporation
have?
unknown
speaker
hundreds
of
thousands?
unknown
speaker
the
merits
really
are
totally
irrelevant
to
what
you
are
arguing
anyway
there,
aren’t
they?
unknown
speaker
but
we
have
a
constitutional
issue
here.
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
shed
any
light
on
whether
this
one
share
of
stock
was
acquired
as
a
prejuder
to
this
litigation?
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
suppose
in
delaware
there
is
an
action
on
a
contract
in
a…
unknown
speaker
suppose
in
the
state
of
delaware
there
is
an
action
on
a
contract
and
the
plaintiff
attaches
property
pursuant
to
the
delaware
attachment
statute
and
do
you
think
delaware
has
to
afford
that
defendant
an
early
hearing,
a
probable
cause
hearing
to
avoid
a
mistake?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
the
cases
in
this
court
indicate
that
there
are
some
procedures
of
due
process
protections
available
to
a
defendant
whose
property
is
attached?
unknown
speaker
when
i
asked
you
a
question
whether
--
must
delaware
law
afford
a
defendant
an
early
hearing
as
to
whether
the
plaintiff
has
a
probable
cause
basis
for
his
claim.
unknown
speaker
i
did
not
say
these
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
let
me
put
it
to
you
again.
let
suppose
that
both
plaintiff
and
defendant
are
residents
of
delaware
in
my
example.
unknown
speaker
now,
must
there
be
a
hearing
or
no?
unknown
speaker
i
know
this
statute
does
not,
but
the
attachment
statute
does,
some
attachment
statue
does.
unknown
speaker
well,
(inaudible)
your
claim
is
that,
as
long
as
delaware
is
purporting
to
get
jurisdiction,
you
can
just
put
aside
all
procedures
of
due
process
protection.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
have
to
give
a
hearing
prior
to
trial.
unknown
speaker
mr.
maschio,
what
interest
is
the
state
of
delaware
has
in
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
i
think
i
should
preface
it.
you
are
from
new
york,
the
other
side
is
from
san
francisco
and
nobody
is
here
from
delaware.
now
how
do
we
know
what
interest
does
state
of
delaware
has
in
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
brief
from
the
state
of
delaware.
unknown
speaker
so
what
is
delaware
--
you
tell
me
what
delaware’s
interest
is,
since
delaware
is
not
interested?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
true
if
there
were
not
a
single
stock
holder
in
delaware?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
true
if
there
were
not
a
single
stock
holder
living
in
delaware.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be,
delaware
still
would
have
an
interest.
unknown
speaker
it
is
just
like
the
interest
they
say
that
the
stock
belongs
to
them
in
delaware,
it
seems
to
me.
it
is
one
fiction
on
top
of
another.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
goes
back,
as
long
as
you
had
the
common
law.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
it
does
not.
unknown
speaker
not
that
far.
unknown
speaker
mr.
maschio,
you
before
you
get
on
another
subject,
do
you
have
any
precedence
other
than
from
the
delaware
state
courts
or,
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction,
where
the
defendants
must
subject
themselves
to
liability
above
the
value
of
the
property
which
has
been
attached
in
any
other
state?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
not
so
much
interested
in
statutory
provisions.
has
there
been
any
decision
by
this
court
or
any
other
court
that
you
are
aware
of
that
has
sustained
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction
for
an
amount
in
excess
of
the
value
of
the
property?
unknown
speaker
the
defendant
can
limit
their
liability
to
the
value
of
the
property
simply
by
not
appearing,
is
that
not
correct?
unknown
speaker
you
can't
both
that
and
defend
the
action.
that
used
to
be
the
standard
procedure.
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
are
against
that
unknown
speaker
no
but
have
in
any
of
those
cases
by
defending
the
action
as
he
been
required
to
take
the
risk
to
the
judgment
in
excess
of
the
value
of
the
property
might
be
entered
against
them.
unknown
speaker
you
enter
a
special
appearance
to
contest
the
procedures
under
which
the
quasi
in
rem
attachment
had
taken
place
or
they
can
test
his
ownership
of
the
property
or
so
on
and
if
you
are
ruled
against
in
that,
then
his
option
was
to
go
back
to
his
home
state
and
forfeit
the
property
or
to
remain
there
and
enter
a
general
appearance
and
defend
the
lawsuit.
unknown
speaker
that
was
standard
operating
procedure,
back
as
i
said
in
the
old
days
unknown
speaker
but
you
cannot
cite
any
case
sustaining
that
procedure.
unknown
speaker
you
need
good
counsel.
unknown
speaker
mr.
maschio
what
do
you
understand
the
holding
of
the
ownbey
case
to
be?
unknown
speaker
the
issue
in
the
ownbey
case
was
whether
the
defendant
had
to
post
a
special
bond
in
order
to
enter
a
general
appearance
(voice
overlap)
security.
unknown
speaker
did
i
understand
you?
did
i
hear
you
correctly
to
say
you
do
not
think
we
would
decide
the
ownbey
case
the
same
way
today?
unknown
speaker
which
is
what
the
issue
was
in
the
ownbey
case?
unknown
speaker
but
yet
you
rely
on
ownbey.
unknown
speaker
all
victim.
unknown
speaker
none
of
those
deals
with
the
judgment
in
excess
of
the
value
of
the
property
seized
either.
unknown
speaker
this
case,
you
are
not
interested
in
property
at
all,
you
are
interested
in
getting
them
in
the
court.
unknown
speaker
doesn’t
it
differentiate
your
case
than
any
other?
unknown
speaker
good
or
bad.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
a
man
can
be
brought
in
and
get
a
judgment
against
for
a
$100,000
is
better
than
if
it
is
limited
to
$1,000,
we
have
done
for
the
plaintiff.
unknown
speaker
and
settlement
too.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
have
said
two
or
three
times
that
once
a
general
appearance
is
made,
the
stock
that
has
been
sequestered
is
released.
unknown
speaker
does
that
follow
automatically
without
regard
to
the…
unknown
speaker
would
that
imply
upon
or
whether
or
not
the
party
who
has
made
a
general
appearance
may
be
judgment
proof,
if
the
stock
is
released.
unknown
speaker
so
more
and
more
automatic
release
really
depends
on
whether
or
not
you
can
satisfy…
unknown
speaker
well,
going
over
to
the
personal
jurisdiction
side
of
the
case,
suppose
there
was
no
property
in
delaware,
but
nevertheless
the
suit
was
brought
there
and
suppose
that
delaware
could
not
get
personal
jurisdiction
over
these
non
resident
defendants
under
international
shoe,
or
cases
following
international
shoe,
they
just
warrant
minimum
context,
that
delaware
just
would
exceed
it
is
authority
to
serve
these
people
and
get
personal
jurisdiction
on
them.
suppose
that
were
the
case,
then
your
position
is
i
take
it
that
if
you
had
one
single
fact
in
addition,
namely
that
one
of
those
defendants
does
have
property
in
the
state,
you
may
get
personal
jurisdiction
over
him.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
argument
in
the
case
is
that
except
for
this
property,
delaware
could
not
get
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
argument
is
that
without
the
property
delaware
could
not
exercise
jurisdiction
over
these
defendants.
unknown
speaker
but
with
the
property
your
position
is,
you
may
not
only
exercise
jurisdiction
over
the
property,
but
personal
jurisdiction
over
them.
unknown
speaker
just
by
the
fact
of
owning
property.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
the
only
tie
you
have
got
with
the
jurisdiction
is
through
the
corporation.
unknown
speaker
that’s
all,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
however
important
it
is,
you
say
yes
that
is
all.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
the
property.
unknown
speaker
they
are
also
directors
and
officers
and
employees.
unknown
speaker
that’s
a
valid
argument
you
have
jurisdiction
over
the
seven
non
stock
holder
defendants
as
well,
and
delaware
doesn’t
sustain
that
jurisdiction.
that
argument
applies
equally
to
the
non
stock
holder
defendants
unless
you
rely
on
the
stock
holders.
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
have
a
statutory
basis
for
this
other
kind
of
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
but
your
argument,
your
submission
to
my
brother
white
was
if
delaware
did
have
a
long
arm
statute,
it
is
application
to
the
all
the
defendants
in
this
case
would
be
constitutionally
permissible
because
of
their
relationship
with
the
delaware
corporation,
quite
apart
from
their
stock
ownership.
unknown
speaker
it
was
based
on
major
attachment
statute
than
to
sustain
the
jurisdiction,
are
you
saying
that
or
not?
unknown
speaker
so
you
need
the
attachment
statute.
unknown
speaker
since
delaware
does
not
have
a
long
arm
statute.
unknown
speaker
you
haven’t
raised
any
question
here
about
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
over
the
appeal
brought
by
your
colleague.
this
is
a
final
order,
this
is
a
lawsuit,
a
derivative
lawsuit
brought
by
you
and
this
is
just
a
interlocutory
order
in
the
course
of
that
lawsuit
is
new
to
the
state
case.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
if
we
do
not
have
any
jurisdiction,
we
do
not
have
any
jurisdiction
no
matter
how
important
or
interesting
the
constitutional
question
they
seem,
it
is
prematurely
here,
we
don’t
have
jurisdiction
to
consider
it,
wasn’t
this
is
just
an
interlocutory
order
in
an
ongoing
state
lawsuit
or
a
state
action,
bill
on
equity?
unknown
speaker
so,
was
not
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
not
a
fact.
unknown
speaker
well,
accept
counsel,
if
you
loose
here,
there
are
lawsuits
all
over,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
yes
but,
you
still
might
loose.
you
still
might
loose.
you
might
have
got
a
judgment
on
the
merits.
i
have
never
got
to
make
a
premature
constitutional
decision.
and
we
have
in
our
jurisdiction,
you
couldn’t
loose,
i
think
as
respondent.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
do
you
need
counsel?
unknown
speaker
do
you
need
counsel?
unknown
speaker
and
you
suggest
there
is
no
mandamus
remedy
available
to
you,
if
you
bring
that
to
a
head?
unknown
speaker
then
there
will
be
no
more
claim.
unknown
speaker
though
on
this
basically
interlocutory
matter.
unknown
speaker
under
the
delaware
judgment,
all
that
needs,
all
it
has
decided
is
that
you
are
properly
in
the
lawsuit,
a
lawsuit
now
can
go
on,
on
the
merits,
that’s
all
the
delaware
has
been
told.
unknown
speaker
certainly,
mr.
justice
marshal.
that
is
what
that
they
tend
to
--
