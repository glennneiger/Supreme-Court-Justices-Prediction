mr.
john
r.
reese
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case
today
concerns
the
constitutionality
of
the
delaware's
sequestration
statute
as
it
was
applied
to
seize
the
property
of
some
21
nonresident
defendants
in
an
action
having
no
substantial
relationship
to
the
state
of
delaware.
this
is
an
appeal,
on
the
decision
of
the
delaware
supreme
court
upholding
that
application
of
the
statute.
this
is
a
shareholder’s
derivative
suit
brought
by
the
holder
of
one
share
of
stock
of
the
greyhound
corporation
against
some
28
individual
defendants.
the
action
is
alleged
to
be
brought
on
behalf
of
greyhound
and
its
subsidiary
greyhound
lines,
inc.,
both
of
which
have
their
principal
places
of
business
in
phoenix,
arizona.
the
greyhound
corporation
is
a
delaware
corporation.
greyhound
lines,
inc.
is
incorporated
in
california.
now,
the
individual
defendants
are
28,
present
or
former
officers,
directors
or
in
some
cases
employees
of
either
one
or
the
other
of
those
companies.
mr.
john
r.
reese
no,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
now,
that
is
why
i
tried
to
put
it
in
conjunctives.
some
are
officers,
some
are
directors,
and
some
are
both.
mr.
john
r.
reese
that
is
right.
some
of
them
hold
no
position
with
the
delaware
corporation.
it
is
worth
noting
that
at
this
point.
some
of
the
individual
defendants
have
only
held
positions
with
the
california
corporation.
as
i
said,
none
of
the
defendants
is
a
resident
of
the
state
of
delaware,
neither
is
the
plaintiff
incidentally.
so
as
far
as
the
record
in
this
case
shows
no
defendant
has
ever
been
in
delaware
or
done
any
act
in
that
state.
the
conduct
charge
against
them
in
a
complaint
occurred
far
from
delaware.
the
essence
of
those
charges
is
that
the
individual
defendants
ought
to
be
held
liable
for
the
reason
that
the
companies
were
found
have
violated
a
court
order
and
because
the
companies
suffered
an
adverse
verdict
in
antitrust
case,
that
is
still
on
appeal
and
not
yet
final.
but
those
charges
are
not
before
court.
today
the
issue
is
whether
the
delaware
sequestration
statute
can
constitutionally
be
applied
to
sequester
the
defendant’s
stock
as
means
for
coercing
their
general
appearance
in
the
action.
now,
delaware
has
no
long
arm
statute
applicable
to
individuals.
none
of
these
defendants
was
personally
seized
with
--
served
with
process.
instead
the
plaintiff
obtained
an
ex
parte
order
from
the
court
of
chancery
in
delaware,
seizing
any
property
that
the
defendants
had
in
the
state.
in
this
case
the
property
seized
consisted
primarily
of
capital
stock
issued
by
a
delaware
corporation.
the
seizure
was
affected
by
an
order
to
the
corporation
directing
it
not
to
affect
any
transfers
of
those
shares
on
its
books.
the
certificates
themselves
were
not
seized
and
they
could
not
be
seized
because
they
are
not
in
delaware
either.
delaware
accomplishes
the
seizure.
mr.
john
r.
reese
well,
under
the
uniform
commercial
code
as
applied
in
every
state
except
delaware,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
certificate
itself
must
be
seized
in
order
to
affect
an
attachment.
delaware
alone
adopts
the
contrary
rule
namely
that
the
situs
of
the
stock
is
deemed
to
be
in
the
state
of
incorporation
of
the
issuing
corporation.
mr.
john
r.
reese
as
far
as
i
know
that
has
always
been
the
delaware
rule.
mr.
john
r.
reese
at
this
point,
delaware
is
unique
in
holding
that
rule.
every
other
jurisdiction
has
adopted
those
provisions
of
the
commercial
code
that
embody
the
stock
and
the
certificate.
mr.
john
r.
reese
it
depends
on
the
purpose
for
which
the
state
uses
that
legal
fiction
mr.
justice
stevens.
we
do
challenge
the
power
of
the
state
to
use
that
fiction
for
the
purpose
of
the
serene
jurisdiction
over
non-resident
defendants
or
to
adjudicate
their
rights
in
that
stock.
mr.
john
r.
reese
it
is
not
necessary
to
reach
that
question
in
this
case…
mr.
john
r.
reese
our
position
is
that
a
fictional
situs
for
an
intangible
property
is
an
insufficient
basis
for
adjudication
of
personal
rights.
mr.
john
r.
reese
correct.
mr.
john
r.
reese
that
is
all
we
need
to
decide
in
this
case.
mr.
john
r.
reese
well,
we
might
be
making
some
of
our
same
arguments
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
reese
we
would
still
be
objecting
to
the
course
of
purpose
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
r.
reese
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
reese
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
reese
yes,
your
honor,
we
would.
i
think
that
it
is
worth
noting
that
connection
that
if
those
certificates
were
there,
the
odds
are
very
much
greater,
that
the
defendants
would
have
had
some
substantial
relationship.
mr.
john
r.
reese
okay,
that
is
fine.
mr.
john
r.
reese
well,
the
same
constitutional
problems
would
exist
to
some
extent
in
the
case
of
tangible
property.
in
the
case
of
tangible
property
that
is
in
the
jurisdiction
through
no
fault,
if
you
will,
or
without
the
knowledge
or
consent
the
defendant,
i
think
the
arguments
would
apply
with
the
same
force.
mr.
john
r.
reese
that
is
correct
and
our
argument
goes
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
relationship
between
a
defendant
and
the
jurisdiction,
before
that
jurisdiction
may
assert
its
power
over
the
defendant.
now,
we
should
note
that
state
of
delaware
could
not
use
its
sequestration
procedure
in
this
case
to
reach
all
of
the
defendants
in
the
plaintiff
suit,
only
those
which
had
something
that
delaware
considered
to
be
property
in
the
state.
as
a
result,
seven
of
the
main
defendants
are
not
before
the
court,
were
not
brought
into
the
case
and
are
not
really
parties
to
this
appeal.
there
is
no
real
dispute
about
how
the
delaware
procedure
works.
it
has
been
interpreted
and
applied
by
the
delaware
courts
for
many
years
and
the
procedure
is
well
established.
first
of
all,
it
is
an
ex
parte
procedure.
the
order
seizing
the
property
is
issued
without
notice
or
prior
opportunity
for
hearing.
second,
that
order
is
issued
automatically
if
only
two
facts
are
alleged.
the
first
fact
is
if
the
defendant
is
a
non-resident
and
second
fact
is
that
he
owns
property
in
the
state
of
the
delaware.
if
only
those
two
facts
are
alleged,
the
order
must
issue
and
there
is
no
discretion
to
deny
it.
mr.
john
r.
reese
in
this
case
your
honor,
a
bond
of
the
$1,000
was
posted.
mr.
john
r.
reese
that
would
certainly
alleviate
the
first
problem
of
lack
of
prior
notice
and
opportunity
for
hearing.
mr.
john
r.
reese
it
would
make
it
less
unfair.
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
that
that
would
cure
the
other
deficiencies
that
if
existed
in
statute.
mr.
john
r.
reese
yes,
we
would.
mr.
john
r.
reese
that
is
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
eliminates
the
ability
of
the
defendant
to
enter
a
special
appearance
to
contest
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
or
even
to
enter
a
limited
appearance
to
defend
to
the
extent
of
his
property.
mr.
john
r.
reese
on
the
merits,
yes.
to
get
this
order
issued
then,
it
does
not
matter
who
the
plaintiff
is
or
who
are
the
plaintiffs
are
and
it
does
not
matter
what
the
claim
is
about
or
where
the
claim
arose
or
whether
the
claim
is.
mr.
justice
stevens,
there
is
no
determination
whatever
of
whether
that
claim
has
any
merit
at
all
before
that
order
issues.
mr.
john
r.
reese
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
r.
reese
well,
the
only
connection
that
delaware
has
with
any
party
or
anything
else
in
this
case
is
that
one
of
the
two
corporate
defendants
happens
to
have
been
incorporated
in
delaware.
none
of
the
individual
defendants,
nor
the
plaintiff
who
filed
the
lawsuit
is
a
resident
of
delaware.
mr.
john
r.
reese
any
claim
brought
by
any
plaintiff.
mr.
john
r.
reese
inequitable
claim
for
the
recovery
of
money
is
the
way
the
statute
is
described.
mr.
john
r.
reese
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
r.
reese
this
particular
statute
is
not
your
honor.
delaware
still
has
a
foreign
attachment
statute
which
has
some
of
the
same
characteristics
as
the
sequestration
statute.
mr.
john
r.
reese
well
i
think
the
question
in
it
as
i
see
it
would
be
whether
the
purpose
to
obtain
jurisdiction
is
by
itself
such
a
significant
state
interest
as
to
justify
postponing
notice
and
a
prior
opportunity
for
hearing.
mr.
john
r.
reese
that
is
correct,
that
is
a
possibility.
mr.
john
r.
reese
yes
or
at
the
very
minimum,
the
state
must
provide
some
kind
of
procedural
safe
guard
to
protect
the
defendant?
mr.
john
r.
reese
against
the
cease
of
property
on
the
basis
of
a
frivolous
or
baseless
claim
or
whatever.
if
there
is
not
prior
notice
or
opportunity
for
hearing
then
there
certainly
must
be
some
kind
of
protective
mechanism.
mr.
john
r.
reese
at
least
two,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
reese
one
is
if
there
is
no
opportunity
for
a
hearing
at
all
at
any
time,
the
property
must
be
released
even
if
it
was
seized
to
get
jurisdiction
and
the
second
is
that,
even
if
there
was
a
hearing
and
even
a
probable
cause
was
shown,
the
state
may
not
–
condition
is
right
to
defend,
up
to
the
value
of
the
property
on
his
submitting
the
‘in
personam’
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
r.
reese
we
are
talking
now
about
a
pre-seizure
hearing
or
a
port-seizure
hearing?
mr.
john
r.
reese
it
would
be
directed
to
whether
the
claimant
had
any
basis
or
merit.
mr.
john
r.
reese
the
underlying…
mr.
john
r.
reese
no.
mr.
john
r.
reese
under
delaware
law
this
is
conceded
to
be
property
of…
mr.
john
r.
reese
under
delaware
law
that
is
conceded…
mr.
john
r.
reese
in
this
case,
it
would
not.
mr.
john
r.
reese
it
will
be
directed
to
the
question
whether
the
underlying
claim
to
the
client
had
sufficient
merit
to
justify
the
use
of
the
state
seizure
powers.
mr.
john
r.
reese
thank
you,
i
would
agree
about
a
hearing
to
establish
the
validity
or
probable
validity
in
the
language
used
in
fuentes
and
north
georgia.
mr.
john
r.
reese
that
interest
is
not
entirely
divorced
from
the
delaware
statute
either
mr.
justice
stewart,
because
under
delaware
law,
the
property
maybe
retained
to
satisfy
an
eventual
judgment
if
the
court
determines
that
that
should
be
so.
so,
the
statute
does
serve
a
dual
purpose.
it
is
both
to
obtain
jurisdiction
and
to
secure
a
judgment.
so,
it
has
that
aspect
that
is
common
to
the
creditor
cases.
mr.
john
r.
reese
well,
it
has
the
cohesive
vice.
mr.
john
r.
reese
if
a
defendant
in
delaware
who
has
been
subjected
to
the
procedure
declines
to
submit
to
that
coercion
and
just
stays
away
and
forfeits
a
property…
he
forfeits
the
property
without
any
adversary
hearing
whatever.
it
is
just
gone.
now,
that
is
a
statute
that
has
a
potentially
enormous
impact
together
because
the
appellee
has
pointed
out
over
one
half
of
the
most
important
companies
in
united
states
have
chosen
delaware
as
the
place
to
incorporate
and
all
of
their
share
holders
are
vulnerable
to
the
use
of
this
procedure
on
any
claim
that
any
plaintiff
might
choose
to
assert
against
them.
mr.
john
r.
reese
any
equitable
claim
that
any
plaintiff
might
choose
to
assert
against
them.
mr.
john
r.
reese
equitable
claim
for
money.
now,
we
submit
that
that
procedure
is
not
only
unfair,
but
that
is
unnecessary
and
it
is
obsolete.
it
has
a
whole
catalog
of
defects.
i
think
most
of
them
we
have
touched
on
already.
there
is
no
prior
notice
or
opportunity
for
hearing.
there
is
no
consideration
of
the
merit,
either
before
or
after
the
seizure
takes
place.
the
defendant
is
not
permitted
any
right
to
defend
unless
he
submits
himself
unlimited
personal
jurisdiction
in
the
state.
there
is
no
adequate
provision
for
indemnifying
the
defendant
against
a
wrong
procedure.
the
purpose
of
the
state
is
to
assert
personal
jurisdiction
over
the
defendant,
but
in
this
case,
none
of
the
defendants
and
who
know
the
controversy
has
a
substantial
relationship
with
the
state
of
delaware
and
even
the
property
that
delaware
has
purported
to
use
as
a
basis
for
the
proceeding
is
located
there
by
reason
of
illegal
fiction
that
no
other
state
continues
to
accept.
mr.
john
r.
reese
as
my
understanding,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
r.
reese
i
think
in
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
stevens
question
on
that
point
earlier,
i
indicated
that
it
depends
on
what
state
then
does
with
its
legal
fiction
and
i
think
the
case
does
raise
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
the
state
does
not
exercise
in
jurisdiction
over
property
that
is
not
truly
within
its
borders.
mr.
john
r.
reese
our
argument
would
be
weaker.
it
would
basically
follow
the
same
constitutional
lines.
mr.
john
r.
reese
i
think
that
the
court
has
previously
recognized
limits
on
the
ability
of
state
through
the
use
of
fictions,
to
deem
property
to
be
within
its
borders
for
the
purpose
of
asserting
jurisdiction.
the
case
of
an
intangible
fiction
is
surely
a
more
questionable
one
than
the
case
of
a
tangible.
mr.
john
r.
reese
this
claim?
mr.
john
r.
reese
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
car,
the
car
had
no
--
because
of
action
in
arizona,
the
car
being
there
or
being
own
there.
well,
we
would
certainly
be
here
making
the
same
argument.
mr.
john
r.
reese
state
of
delaware
considers
the
defendant’s
contacts,
for
the
relationship
of
the
controversy
to
the
state
to
be
irreverent.
mr.
john
r.
reese
no,
the
development
of
intangible
property
is
however
causing
a
serious
question
whether
you
ought
to
follow
that
same
analysis
for
jurisdictional
purpose?
mr.
john
r.
reese
well
that
certainly
is
our
position.
mr.
john
r.
reese
i
am
not
aware
of
the
case.
it
could
not
--
you
have
to
show
up
in
court
mr.
john
r.
reese
certainly
in
many
jurisdictions.
mr.
john
r.
reese
i
am
not
able
to
answer
this
question.
mr.
john
r.
reese
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
r.
reese
in
the
absence,
of
a
relationship
between
the
defendant
and
the
state.
mr.
john
r.
reese
that
is
right.
the
court
below
sought
to
defend
this
procedure
largely
on
the
basis
of
two
cases.
one
was
the
district
court
opinion
in
u.s.
industries
against
gregg;
the
second
was
this
court’s
decision
in
1921
in
ownbey
against
morgan.
since,
that
time
the
third
circuit
reversed
the
district
court’s
decision
in
that
case
so,
rather
than
being
support
for
the
decision
below
that
case
is
now
another
reason
for
reversal.
we
submit
that
case
of
ownbey
against
morgan
does
not
support
the
decision
below
either
and
it
is
for
several
reasons.
first,
ownbey
really
did
not
address
question
that
is
presented
to
this
court.
the
validity
of
the
attachment
of
the
defendant’s
property
was
not
really
in
issue
in
ownbey
to
the
extent
the
court
there
assumed
that
that
attachment
was
valid.
the
appellants
submit
that
the
assumption
is
out
of
touch
with
the
procedure
of
due
process
concept
that
this
court
has
developed
and
articulated
in
approximately
60
years
since
ownbey
was
decided.
at
the
time
ownbey
was
decided,
it
may
well
have
been
that
an
attachment
to
secure
jurisdiction
over
a
nonresident
defendant
was
the
only
way
you
could
get
jurisdiction
over
him,
but
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
since
international
shoe
was
decided
about
30
years
ago,
there
has
no
longer
been
a
valid
assumption
and
to
put
it
simply
we
think
that
ownbey
reflects
a
time
and
the
stage
of
analysis
of
the
constitution
that
has
been
superseded.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
r.
reese
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
john
r.
reese
mr.
justice
stewart
we
know
that
an
order
has
been
entered
by
the
highest
court
instead
of
delaware.
mr.
john
r.
reese
presumably,
defaults
would
be
taken
and
the
property
of
the
defendants
sold,
which
--
a
point
we
could
start
back
up.
mr.
john
r.
reese
if
we
successfully
defended
on
the
merits
the
lawsuit
would
be
over.
mr.
john
r.
reese
it
is
a
question
that
i
have
not
considered
previously
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
john
r.
reese
pardon.
mr.
john
r.
reese
yeah,
i
will
take
it
if
i
can
get
it.
i
want
to
correct…
mr.
john
r.
reese
mr.
chief
justice,
the
property
of
these
defendants
has
been
tied
up
for
two-and-a-half
years.
no
responsible
official
of
the
state
of
delaware
has
ever
during
that
period
considered
whether
there
is
a
baseless
or
a
sound
or
any
other
kind
of
claim
against
them
to
justify
that
deprivation
of
their
property.
we
think
that
it
is
more
than
long
enough
for
that
condition
to
be
allowed
to
continue
and
that
it
is
time
for
it
to
be
ended.
mr.
john
r.
reese
we
have
pursued
the
matter
through
the
state
court
system
to
the
end
point.
delaware
supreme
court
has
rendered
its
final
judgment
on
the
matter.
mr.
john
r.
reese
to
the
extent
a
two-and-a-half-year
deprivation
is
interlocutory.
mr.
john
r.
reese
i
am
sorry.
i
missed
your
question
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
john
r.
reese
that’s
clear.
mr.
john
r.
reese
the
only
step
remaining
is
to
conduct
the
final
hearing
and
the
sale
of
the
property.
mr.
john
r.
reese
yes.
mr.
john
r.
reese
in
this
case
delaware
supreme
court
has
issue
a
final
judgment
as
to
the
validity
of
the
taking
of
the
defendant’s
property.
the
defense
now
has
only
the
choice
that
you
pointed
out.
mr.
john
r.
reese
or
to
enter
a
general
appearance
and
giving
up
at
that
point,
their
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
having
a
trial
in
a
proper
form.
mr.
john
r.
reese
that
is
our
position
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
r.
reese
yes,
the
defendants
stand
a
loose
a
lot
by
just
being
forced
to
the
trial
on
the
merits
at
this
point,
part
of
the
point
of
it.
