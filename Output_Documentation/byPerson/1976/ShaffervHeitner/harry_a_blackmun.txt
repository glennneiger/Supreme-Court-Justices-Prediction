do
each
one
of
the
28
fulfill
what
you
have
just
stated
either
an
officer
or
a
director
or
a
key
employee?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
all
are
one
or
the
other?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
that
is
very
much
the
minority
rule
you
say,
just
as
a
matter
of
situs
of
property?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
may
i
ask
you
this
which
is
the
other
side
of
the
same
coin.
if
the
certificates
were
in
fact
in
the
state
of
delaware,
would
you
not
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
why
do
you
not
be
making
the
same
basic
argument
that
my
brother
white
has
just
identified
that
you
cannot
use
that
in
order
to
obtain
personal
jurisdiction?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
(voice
overlap)
arguments
that
are
same.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
there
a
fiction
in
any
of
that?
the
certificate
is
only
a
certificate.
it
is
not
a
property.
it
is
just
a
certificate
of
ownership
and
anything
more
than
the
situs
of
the
insuring
corporation
is
the
property,
wherever
you
going
to
locate
the
situs,
it
is
going
to
be
something
of
fiction,
is
not
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
even
though
delaware
follow
the
majority
rule
and
say
that
the
situs
of
the
certificates
is
the
situs
of
the
personal
property
and
if
the
certificates
of
the
defendants
in
this
case,
all
were
happen
to
be
locked
up
in
the
corporationâ€™s
safe
deposit
box
in
delaware,
you
would
still
be
making
the
same
basic
constitutional
argument,
would
you
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
they
might
be
in
residence,
but
i
am
assuming
they
are
not.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
does
it
really
turn
on
the
situs
of
the
stock?
your
position
is
basically
the
same.
it
is
unfair
to
seize
the
property
without
and
use
it
for
this
purpose
of
gaining,
of
forcing
someone
in
the
general
appearance.
