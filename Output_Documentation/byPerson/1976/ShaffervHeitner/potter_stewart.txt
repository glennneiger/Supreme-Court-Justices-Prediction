justice
potter
stewart
they
under
the
uniform
commercial
code,
am
i
incorrect
in
my
memory
that
the
situs
of
the
certificate
is
the
situs
of
the
stock.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
as
my
brother
mike
pointed
out
involves
different
state
interests,
different
interests
and
other
interests,
in
that
case
the
question
was
who
was
entitled
to
the
property?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
also
has
in
your
submission
an
additional
vice
in
this
system?
justice
potter
stewart
that
even
if
there
is
a
hearing,
it
has
the
cohesive
advice.
justice
potter
stewart
any
equitable
claim.
justice
potter
stewart
equitable
claim
for
money?
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
thought
that
after
that
last
point
you
did
not
question
the
power
of
delaware
to
say
in
this
state
they
read
the
personal
property,
when
it
comes
to,
we
are
talking
about
shares
of
stock
shall
be
decided
for
the
issuing
corporation.
and
if
the
issuing
corporation
is
in
pennsylvania,
even
though
the
certificates
are
in
delaware,
i
gather
that
the
under
delaware
law,
the
property
is
in
pennsylvania.
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
did
i
misunderstand
you
when
you,
when
i
thought
that
you
just
say
that
you
were
not
questioning
the
power
of
delaware
to
identify
the
situs
of
the
personal
property
as
depending
upon
the
situs
of
the
issuing
corporation?
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
argument
i
think
you
said
and
tell
me
if
i
misunderstood
you
because
it
is
of
some
importance;
wouldn’t
your
argument
is
be
the
same
if
this
was
a
single
defendant,
who
has
lived
in
arizona,
but
whose
automobile
is
in
delaware?
justice
potter
stewart
in
constitutional
matter
why
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
the
claim
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
car?
justice
potter
stewart
this
claim.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
this
is
the
point.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
nothing
new
about
that.
in
fact,
what
is
new
is
international
shoe
if
you
are
as
old
as
i
am
--
because
in
my
law
school
days
there
was
no
such
thing
as
the
international
shoe
doctrine
and
it
was
a
quite
a
usual
thing
for
every
state
to
provide
that
the
if
a
laws
suit
involved
real
property
then
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
existed
wherever
the
real
property
was
situated.
if
it
involved
any
other
kind
of
a
lawsuit,
if
there
was
personal
property
within
the
jurisdiction,
you
could
acquire
personal
jurisdiction
to
the
extent
of
the
value
the
property
by
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction.
there
is
nothing
new
about
this
basic
system,
is
there?mr.
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
not
sure,
one
of
your
plans
was
that
now,
that
we
are
in
the
regime
of
international
shoe
that
we
should
forget
all
that,
all
those
previous
devices
to
acquire
personal
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought.
mr.
reese
even
in
the
times
to
which
my
brother
steward
refers
was
it
permissible
to
get
jurisdiction
by
quasi
in
rem
method
and
obtain
a
judgment
for
more
than
the
value
of
the
property?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
international
shoe
did
not
provide
an
alternative
criterion
of
due
process
constitutionality,
but
provided
a
new
one
that
implicitly
overruled
the
old
one?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
reese,
how
about
this
finality
does,mr.
reese,
before
any…
justice
potter
stewart
interlocutory
order.
i
mean
this
is
an
ongoing
lawsuit
particularly
because
of
the
way
we
have
decided
the
case
on
the
merits.
if
nothing
can
happen,
this
case
would
go
back
for
trial
in
the
state
court,
would
it
not,
and
the
plaintiff
might
loose
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
it
and
might
not
that
indicate
that
this
is
not
a
final
judgment.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
is
one
presumption.
another
presumption
is
you
go
and
defend
the
lawsuit
unless
thought
that
you
were,
the
plaintiff
had
a
great
deal
of
force
in
his
claim.
and
under
that
presumption
if
you
defended
the
lawsuit
and
did
so
successful
this
case
would
be
over,
wouldn’t
it,
if
we
decide
in
your
favor
on
the
merits.
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore
why
is
this
a
final
order,
and
if
it
is
not
as
you
know
we
do
not
have
any
jurisdiction
over
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
just
occurred
to
me.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
only
that
is
if
you
are
going
to
default
in
the
lawsuit?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
let
us
say
this
were
a
case
in
delaware
in
which
there
was
a
personal
service
upon
a
resident
defendant
of
delaware
and
his
claim
was
there
was
something
defective
about
that
service
and
that
as
a
constitutional
matter
there
was
something
defective
of
the
personal
service
of
him
and
delaware.
he
brought
that
up
all
the
way
up
to
the
delaware
supreme
court
and
delaware
supreme
court
said
no
as
a
constitutional
matter
that
is
end
as
well
as
statutory,
this
is
a
perfectly
valid
service.
then
this
court
would
not
have
jurisdiction
that
way,
not
the
interlocutory.
all
i
would
have
decided
was
that
you
and
mr.
defendant
have
to
go
and
defend
the
lawsuit.
justice
potter
stewart
defaulting
in
lawsuit
or
defending
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
because
you
might
win
on
the
merits,
and
if
you
loose
on
the
merits
you
would
not
have
given
up
your
fourteenth
amendment
plan,
because
it
then
would
be
a
final
judgment
that
you
could
bring
to
this
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that’s
one
of
the
prices
of
not
allowing
the
interlocutory
appeals
too.
