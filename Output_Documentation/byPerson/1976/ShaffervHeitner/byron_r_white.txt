that
could
be
even
to
the
denial
of
the
stock.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
reached
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
even
if
delaware
could
subject
the
property
to
a
judgment,
and
your
point
is
they
cannot
compel,
use
that
property
to
compel
personal
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
all
you
need
to
decide
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
suggest
that
before
state
may
get
jurisdiction
by
attaching
property
there
must
be
a
prior
hearing?
you
do
not
suggest
that,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
getting
jurisdictions
puts
a
statement
being
able
to
get
jurisdiction
is
a
â€“
puts
a
considerable
different
interest
in
the
picture.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
state
may
never
give
up
the
chance
automatically,
by
giving
notice,
people
move
their
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
of
that
you
would
say
the
state
must
give
the
four
day
opportunity
for
a
timely
hearing
for
a
probable
cause
on
the
merits.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
position
is
not
(inaudible)
that
a
state
may
not
insist
that
the
defendant
submit
himself
generally
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
as
a
price
for
defending
his
property
in
the
state?
