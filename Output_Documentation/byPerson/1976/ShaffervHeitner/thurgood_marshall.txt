doesn’t
the
judgment
hold
that
your
property
has
been
seized
and
if
you
don’t
submit
to
that
jurisdiction,
your
property
is
gone?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
interlocutory?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
do
not
submit
to
that
jurisdiction,
which
you
say
they
do
not
have,
then
you
lose
your
property,
that’s
been
decided.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
good.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
delaware.
it
is
as,
share
holder's
derivative
suite
which
was
filed
by
the
respondent,
heitner,
who
was
the
owner
of
one
share
of
stock
in
greyhound
corporation
against
officers
and
directors
of
the
government.
greyhound
is
incorporated
in
delaware
but
its
principle
place
of
business
is
in
arizona.
there
is
no
indication
that
the
defendant
directors
had
ever
had
any
contacts
with
delaware.
in
order
to
establish
jurisdiction
over
these
directors,
heitner
utilized
a
delaware
procedure
that
allows
a
plaintiff
to
secure
a
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction
over
a
non-resident
by
attaching
the
defendant's
property
located
in
delaware.
for
the
purposes
of
that
statute,
stock
in
a
delaware
corporation
is
considered
to
be
located
in
delaware.
the
directors
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
the
ground
that
as
applied,
it
allowed
the
state
courts
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
defendants
who
did
not
have
sufficient
contacts
with
the
state
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
do
process.
the
delaware
courts
rejected
this
challenge,
holding
that
the
presence
of
the
defendant's
properly
in
the
state
was
a
constitutionally
adequate
basis
of
jurisdiction.
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
of
the
appealed
and
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
now
reverse.
we
conclude
that
the
due
process
clause
prohibits
the
exercise
of
state
court
jurisdiction
in
the
absence
of
minimum
contacts
among
the
defendants,
the
state
and
the
litigation.
the
distinction
between
actions
and
“personam”
on
the
one
hand,
and
access
in
rem
--
in
quasi
in
rem
on
the
other
no
longer
justifies
the
application
of
different
constitutional
test
of
state
court
jurisdiction.
we
also
conclude
that
the
simple
facts
that
defendants
are
fiduciaries
of
a
corporation
formally
charted
in
delaware
and
owned
stock
or
other
interested
in
that
corporation
do
not
supply
contacts
with
delaware,
sufficient
to
make
them
subject
to
de
suite
in
that
state.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurrent
in
the
judgment.
mr.
brennan
--
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
mr.
justice
rehnquist
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
