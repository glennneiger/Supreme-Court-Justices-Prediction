mr.
james
h.
haddock
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
facts
are
most
important
in
this
case
precisely
as
to
how
this
activity
took
place
on
the
first
day
at
--
this
mississippi
sales
tax
is
required
by
the
statute
to
be
passed
on
to
the
consumer
at
the
time
of
the
sale
by
adding
the
appropriate
amount
of
tax
to
the
bill
and
if
this
court
follows
the
majority
opinion
in
the
joseph
mcgoldrick
v.
berwin-white
company
in
which
say
in
the
majority
opinion
they
stated
that
in
a
tax
of
this
nature
and
the
tax
in
new
york,
the
new
york
tax
in
that
case
was
exactly
like
to
tax
in
mississippi
and
the
court
in
the
majority
opinion
found
that
the
incidence
of
the
tax
was
on
the
consumer.
this
is
a
consumer
tax
is
to
be,
the
sales
tax
of
mississippi
incidentally
was
first
state
sale
tax
that
we
passed
in
1932.
it
is
a
consumer
tax.
it
says
that
it
is
privilege
tax
and
we
do
not
deny
that
it
is
a
privilege
tax
but
it
is
a
tax
placed
on
the
privilege
of
conducting
certain
intrastate
events
which
are
listed
on
the
sale
of
property
or
the
sales
of
services
which
are
performed
exclusively
within
the
state
of
mississippi.
in
the
case
of
the
(inaudible)
the
travel
from
one
point
within
the
mississippi
to
another
point
within
mississippi.
in
this
particular
case,
we
might
look
at
the
actual
transaction
as
the
exhibits
indicate
and
determine
our
position
as
to
why
we
think
this
is
clearly
intrastate
commerce
that
has
been
taxed
or
an
intrastate
activity
at
the
conclusion
or
determination
of
the
shipment
from
consignor
in
one
state
to
the
consignee
in
another
state.
it
is
just
the
same
situation
that
you
would
have
that
somebody
would
send
freight
in
by
rail,
land
into
merchant
and
he
had
somebody
to
go
down
to
the
rail
road
and
pick
it
up
and
bring
it
to
his
business.
it
is
an
exclusively
intrastate
activity
that
the
dealers
of
general
motors
want
to
be
sure
that
the
property
was
sent
from
the
rail
head
to
the
dealer’s
front
door
and
the
dealer
would
not
be
required
to
go
pick
it
up
himself,
that
this
service
was
performed.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
there
was
no
sale
of
the
service
on
that
charge
that
was
on
true
bill
of
lading
from
the
assembly
plant.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
well,
to
a
degree
yes
sir,
we
rely
on
the
bill
of
lading
because
in
the
day
as
complexes
in
modern
business
you
got
to
rely
some
commercial
transaction
in
tax
matters.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
we
do
not
tax
those
going
from
a
mississippi
to
--
from
the
consignor.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
they
all
use.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
they
all
use,
they
are
using
the
mississippi
but
we
do
not
feel
that
a
shipment
from
a
point
in
mississippi
to
a
point
in
another
state
is
exclusively
intrastate
commerce.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
yes
it
is
the
same
vehicle
could
be
used.
in
this
particular
case,
general
motors
ship
their
automobiles
from
general
motors
assembly
plant
in
georgia
to
general
motors
assembly
division
in
jackson,
mississippi
as
a
consignee
by
rail
on
rail
availability.
they
will
then
unloaded
it
on
to
a
large
lot
and
the
mississippi
supreme
court
said
that
up
until
that
particular
point
general
motors
had
control
of
this
property.
they
could
do
with
it
as
they
saw
fit.
they
could
sell
it
somebody
else.
they
could
transfer
it
to
another
dealer.
the
consignment
was
shipped
to
themselves
as
consignee.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
convoy
v.
washington,
which
was
decided
after
spector
that
was
an
identical
case
in
its
own
fact
and
law
and
facts
involved
the
only
difference
was
that
ford
motor
company
was
the
manufacturer
of
automobiles
and
convoy
was
a
shipper
of
the
cars.
there
was
no
difference.
all
of
the
other
facts
of
an
importance
were
exactly
the
same.
the
same
procedure
was
used
and
in
that
case
the
ford
officials
said
that
they
used
this
method
of
shipment,
in
order
to
protect
themselves
in
case
their
dealership
go
bankrupt
after
the
cars
were
shipped,
prior
to
the
shipment
in
mississippi
or
in
the
case
if
they
wanted
to
demand
a
cash
payment
for
the
cars
when
they
shipped
them
out
of
jackson
by
the
carrier.
they
maintained
control
and
the
mississippi
supreme
court
said
that
they
maintained
control
up
to
that
point
because
they
have
shipped
the
cars
to
themselves
out
of
state
to
themselves
in
the
state.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
levy
the
same
tax
on
them
yes
your
honor.
if
it
is
a
dealer
from
mississippi,
yes
we
will
levy
the
same
tax.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
well,
i
guess
i
can
tell
from
the
experience.
i
used
to
own
a
dealership
not
exactly
to
this
extent
but
my
property
was
sent
through
the
railroad
and
i
unloaded
it
and
brought
it,
had
it
brought
to
my
plant
and
if
i
had
engaged
somebody
to
do
and
it
was
used
regularly
i
paid
them
the
sales
tax
on
this
transportation.
there
is
a
fine
line
of
demarcation
and
everybody
realizes
it
is
just
were
interstate
commerce
breaks.
there
is
no
way
that
anybody
can
actually
tell
and
you
have
to
use
some
kind
of
different
solution
in
every
case
as
dependent
on
the
facts
and
the
situations
existing
there,
which
fairly
indicate
the
purposes
and
intent
from
the
paperwork
that
is
involved.
our
position
has
always
been
and
we
think
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
said
that
this
was
intrastate
commerce,
that
this
was
a
local
activity.
it
may
have
been
related
to
or
connected
with
it
in
some
way,
but
it
was
not
intrastate
commerce.
the
reason
they
could
not
have
found
that
it
was
intrastate
commerce
is
that
they
based
their
opinion
in
this
case
and
they
say
that
three
cases
control
this
case.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
well
i
think
it
is.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
well
may
i
rephrase
this.
i
think
first
they
decided
that
this
was
a
local
intrastate
activity
that
was
taxed.
this
is
evident
on
page
108
of
the
appendix
here,
in
which
they
are
talking
about
the
--
the
local
activity
taxed
must
be
warned
that
it
does
not
lend
itself
to
repeated
exactions
in
other
states.
the
general
rule
is
that
a
state
may
tax
a
local
activity,
affecting
or
related
to
interstate
commerce,
if
the
local
activity
is
sufficiently
separate
from
the
out
of
state
aspects
of
interstate
commerce.
i
think
that
no
other
leading
of
this
opinion
by
the
court
first
established
that
this
was
a
sufficiently
separated
activity
from
the
aspects
of
interstate
commerce
conducted
exclusively
within
the
state
of
mississippi.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
i
will
agree
that
does
sound
lacking
on
the
face
of
it,
but
then
if
you
consider
the
three
cases
in
which
they
have
based
their
decision
and
they
say
the
present
case
is
controlled
by
cases
arising
in
this
state.
in
interstate
all
pipeline
company
v.
stone
involved
the
first
leg
of
an
interstate
commerce,
but
the
mississippi
supreme
court
themselves
had
held
that
the
fact
under
those
facts,
that
that
was
intrastate
commerce
in
that
case.
the
same
thing
is
in
dunn
brothers
which
involves…
mr.
james
h.
haddock
sorry.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
yes,
but
i
think
they
are
using
a
leg
of
an
interstate
shipment
as
the
courts
in
these
other
cases
used
the
leg,
as
being
a
movement
from
a
local,
within
the
state,
the
first
leg
being
an
intrastate
activity
prior
to
the
time
that
it
is
actually
shipped
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
i
am
not
sure
about
that
but
in
that
case
that
involved
through
shipments
from
consignor
out
of
state
to
a
consignee
in
the
state.
there
was
no
local
activity
whatsoever,
no
local
commercial
transactions
within
the
state
of
connecticut
and
i
think
spector
is
one
of
our
strongest
supporters
actually
in
what
the
court
said.
the
court
looked
for
the
local
activity,
the
presence
of
that
activity
in
which
base
their
decision,
but
they
could
not
find
it.
there
was
no
local
activity
in
spector.
they
had
no
commercial
transactions
involved
except
from
the
movement
of
commerce
from
one
point
in
connecticut
to
the
point
outside
the
state
of
connecticut.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
the
commercial
activity
is
the
transportation
of
automobiles
from
the
railhead
after
they
had
arrived
in
mississippi
in
the
hands
of
the
owner,
consignor
and
he
ships
them
out
within
the
state
mississippi.
he
is
the
shipper
in
sale,
general
motors
ships
the
automobiles.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
yes
sir,
general
motors
had
a
big
operation
in
mississippi.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
there
would
be
no
problem
except
that
the
dealer
would
have
to
get
the
cars
off
of
the
place
to
bring
up
to
his
place
a
bit.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
no
sir
that
part
of
the
shipment
it
would
not,
that
is
correct,
it
would
not
to
get
to
biloxi,
but
now
if
somebody...
mr.
james
h.
haddock
no
sir,
---
because
there
is
a
shipment,
an
intrastate
shipment
of
the
owner
of
the
property
who
has
possession
and
control
of
the
property
in
mississippi
to
a
consignee
also
located
in
mississippi.
this
is
a
situation
that
exists
in
--
if
a
manufacturer
or
a
big
organization
had
a
warehouse
in
some
state
and
they
manufactured
goods.
the
total
purpose
being
to
sell
those
goods
and
they
ship
them
from
out
of
state
to
that
warehouse,
the
intention
is
that
they
go
on
to
other
places,
when
they
are
shipped
in
there.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
well,
if
they
sell
them
to
complete
auto
or
to
the
dealer
or
to
somebody
else.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
if
they
had
the
same
deal
and
shipped
them
from
meridian
and
they
hold
complete
auto
to
take
them
from
meridian
to
the
dealer,
it
would
be
the
same
proposition.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
there
would
be
taxed.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
no
sir.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
that
would
be
a
different
situation.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
maybe
i
have
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
they
would
not
be
taxed,
no
sir
because
they
would
be
shipping
them
from
themselves
on
a
continuation,
the
property
would
not
change
hands.
they
would
be
still
continuing
to
ship
them
from
themselves
to
themselves.
they
will
be
a
movement
from
out
of
state
to
movement
in
the
state.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
that
will
be
alright
as
long
as
that
is
a
continuous
movement
from
the
first…
mr.
james
h.
haddock
there
is
no
difference
in
the
location.
there
is
a
difference
in
the
commercial
transaction
itself.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
yes
it
is,
but
you
have
to
go
back
and
look
at
the
shipper.
you
have
to
go
back
and
look
at
the
shipper
and
the
person
who
is
receiving
the
goods
and
the
transaction
that
takes
place.
if
it
is
a
commercial
like
transaction,
shipping
property
from
one
person
in
mississippi
as
consignor
to
another
person
in
mississippi
as
consignee
that
transaction
is
taxable.
but
if
it
is
a
movement
of
a
property
belonging
to
a
person
from
an
out
of
state
location
who
is
shipping
goods
to
jackson,
mississippi
and
he
ships
it
to
meridian
to
himself
from
himself
out
of
state
to
himself
in
jackson
and
it
comes
through
by
rail
and
then
by
truck
and
is
still
his
property,
there
is
no
title
change,
there
is
no
possession
change,
there
has
been
no
other
activity,
that
would
not
be
a
taxable
activity
in
which
you
could
tax.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
i
would
say
if
it
is
interstate
commerce...
mr.
james
h.
haddock
no,
sir
i
do
not
think
so...
mr.
james
h.
haddock
it
may
have
been,
i
think
that
we
possibly
could
have
taxed
it
anyway,
but
we
do
not
make
a
practice
of
taxing
interstate
shipments
from
a
consignor
out
of
the
state...
mr.
james
h.
haddock
well
because…
mr.
james
h.
haddock
well,
there
is
such
a
fine
line
in
interstate
commerce
that
we
have
always
considered,
it
has
been
a
basic
principle
of
ours
that
under
our
law
we
could
not
tax
transportation
that
was
coming
from
a
point
outside
of
the
state
to
a
point
inside
of
the
state.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
generally,
yes
sir,
i
would
say.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
i
will
concede
it
unless
this
is
a
local
activity
that
is
so
related
to
it
that
is
apart
from
the
interstate
commerce
and
would
not
be
a
burden
on
it,
would
not
be
discriminatory.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
well,
it
would
depend,
it
depends
on
the
business
transactions
that
the
local
activity
that
was
bought
and
that
would
depend
on
the
transactions
i
think,
well,
in
the
proposition
that
i
do
not
know.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
that
in
principle
possibly
so,
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
answer
that
question
because
you
do
not
know
how
they
can
handle
that
transaction
in
meridian,
you
do
not
know
whether
they
have
control
or
what
the
shipping
document
say?
who
the
property
belongs
to
at
that
particular
time?
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
say
looking
at
the
documents.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
that
general
statement
i
do
not
agree
with,
no
sir.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
yes
sir,
i
would
think
so.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
well,
we
may
not,
we
probably
would
not
tax
it
because
we
do
not
know
about
all
the
transactions
and
we
cannot
tell
them
facts
in
every
case
of
shipment
and
every
situation
that
comes
up.
we
have
adopted
the
principle
in
the
tax
commission,
that
we
will
not
tax
any
part
of
transportation
from
a
consignor
out
of
the
state
to
a
consignor
in
the
state.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
well,
because
it
is
uncertain.
it
has
been
so
uncertain
to
suggest
what
part
of
the
transportation
cost
that
you
could
tax.
it
has
not
been
firmly
established
in
my
mind
as
to
just
what
code
of
demarcation
as
to
property
tax,
as
to
state
tax
or
income
tax.
the
court
has
been
vaguely
able
to
go
along
with
it,
but
in
the
field
of
transportation,
i
guess,
to
be
as
the
court
says
they
found
a
problem,
you
cannot
really
decide
where
the
line
of
demarcation
is,
but
the
court
has...
mr.
james
h.
haddock
yes
sir.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
well,
basically
you
could
not
tax
it
if
the
incidence
of
this
tax
was
on
the
privilege
of
doing
an
interstate
business.
i
think
this
court
has
established
that.
if
it
is
for
some
other
purpose,
i
think
you
can.
now…
mr.
james
h.
haddock
you
are
asking
me
a
philosophical
question.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
constitutionally
act
in
my
opinion,
i
have
to
start
with
a
basic
premise
that
interstate
commerce
should
be
its
own
way.
it
should
be
treated
exactly
like
any
other
commerce
as
long
as
that
is
not
a
barrier
to
prevent
the
free
flow
of
trade.
now,
actually
as
far
as
my
philosophy
is
concerned,
i
think
that
interstate
commerce
should
pay
its
way
and
there
is
only
two
philosophies;
one
that
it
pays
its
own
way
or
one
that
you
cannot
put
in
a
tax
on
and
you
cannot
burden
it,
you
cannot
do
anything
with
it.
but
the
court
has
a
very
difficult
problem.
they
have
look
at
each
case
individually
to
arrive
at
a
satisfactory
method
of
having
the
case,
in
which
they
do
not
have
too
much
guidance
from
congress,
they
just
have
one
simple
state.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
no
sir,
he
would
not.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
i
would
say
that
he
should
pay
his
fair
share
of
what
that
is
and
how
actually…
mr.
james
h.
haddock
no
sir,
i
did
not
say
that.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
i
do
not
think
that
you
should
do
it
on
the
privilege
of
doing
business
under
any
circumstances.
really
if
that
is
where
the
tax
is,
to
pay
a
license
pay
a
$1,000
for
the
privilege
of
going
through
this
state,
i
would
certainly
not
buy
that.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
the
shipment
is
out
of
state
to
an
in
state,
we
charge
no
tax.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
yes
i
think
so,
but...
mr.
james
h.
haddock
yes
sir,
i
think
that
the
privilege
tax
in
this
case,
if
you
go
by
where
the
incidence
of
this
tax,
i
do
not
agree
with
that.
this
is
not
the
basic
philosophy
or
the
constitutional
question,
i
assure
you
that
because
i
have
recognized
the
fact
that
you
go
back
to
the
old
feudal
system
and
danger
of
the
landlords
putting
taxes
on
properties
for
the
privileges
of
passing
through
that.
i
would
be
the
first
one
to
protect
that
constitutional
right.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
no
sir.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
because
they
are
not
and
we
could
not
tax
it
under
the
sales
tax
law
because
there
is
no
exclusively
intrastate
sale
from
it,
from
two
points
within
the
state
of
mississippi.
this
transaction
has
to
be
completely
within
and
not
from
without
to
within.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
they
certainly
can.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
i
think
my
personal
opinion
is
that
they
certainly
could,
but
under
the
opinions
of
supreme
court,
we
have
been
fearful
of
attempting
to
tax
that
portion,
especially
in
view
of
the
language
and
the
dissenting
opinions
in
the
cases
and
the
philosophies
that
we
are
involved
in.
it
is
a
very
close
question
that
we
have
problems
and
we
have
tried
our
best
not
to
get
over
into
the
question
of
taxation
of
a
shipment
from
without
the
state
to
within
the
state
from
a
consignor
out
of
the
state
to
a
consignee
within
the
state.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
i
am
sorry.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
no
sir
i
think
spector
is
right
in
line
with
what
we
saying.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
i
think
spector
personally
should
be,
well
i
will
say
this
that
it
is
a
very
clear
--
i
do
not
like
to
the
aspect
because
i
think
they
were
doing
business
in
the
state
that
would
give
the
state
of
connecticut,
an
opportunity
to
pose
this
tax.
they
were
operating
a
big
business
here
with
a
126
employees.
they
were
operating
trucks
running
around
town.
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
they
were
doing
business
in
the
state,
but
they
were
not,
this
was
a
convenience
that
they
were
doing.
picking
up
goods
and
taking
them
up
to
the
ownership.
they
were
not
doing
a
commercial
transaction
--
conducting
a
commercial
business
transaction.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
yes
sir,
i
sure
do.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
i
say
this
that
it
does
not
clear
our
position.
it
goes
along
actually...
mr.
james
h.
haddock
our
greater
support
comes
from
interstate
all
pipeline
which
involves
firstly
from
stone
v.
dunn
brothers
which
is
an
exactly
the
same
case
where
a
man
shipped
goods
from
california,
shipped
his
own
goods
from
california
to
himself
in
mississippi,
building
a
pipeline
across
the
state.
there
is
no
difference
in
that
case
exactly
which
came
to
this
court,
which
you
took
for
lack
of
federal
--
you
refused
for
lack
of
federal
question
after
spector
came
along
and
after
convoy
and
the
state
of
washington
came
along.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
yes
sir,
i
think
so.
if
those
cars
were
shipped
from
general
motors,
the
assembly
plant
to
general
motors
and
it
sells
in
meridian,
mississippi
and
then
they
had
an
another
transaction
and
shipped
those
cars
from
general
motors
in
meridian
mississippi.
if
they
had
to
some
other
point,
that
shipment
intrastate
shipment,
it
would
be
an
intrastate
commercial
activity
and
one
in
which
only
mississippi
could
tax,
no
other
state
could
duplicate
it.
the
whole
activity
is
directly
related,
anybody
else
would
be
obliged
to
pay
the
tax
for
the
same
proposition.
it
does
not
discriminate
against
anybody.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
yes
sir,
i
admit
they
can
get
around
it
very
easily
under
the
rule
that
i
think
to
the
court.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
it
does
not.
we
are
limited
by
the
state.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
yes
but
it
would
not
be
taxable
under
our
sales
tax
law.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
it
is,
but
there
is
no
commercial
transaction,
we
have
no
provision
for
enforcement.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
yes
on
which
to
base
this
tax
and
in
such
a
case
there
is
no
provision
within
our
law
for
posing
in
a
tax
between
our
state
and
another
state.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
there
has
to
be
a
transaction
either
and
at
least
the
delivery
of
one
end
or...
mr.
james
h.
haddock
by
the
transshipment
by
the
same,
say
delivery
from
one
railroad
to
another.
mr.
james
h.
haddock
i
see,
i
see.
