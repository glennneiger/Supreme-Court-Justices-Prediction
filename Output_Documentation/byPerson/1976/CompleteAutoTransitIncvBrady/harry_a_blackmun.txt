mr.
perry,
how
long
is
mississippi
has
this
statute
in
its
present
form?
justice
harry
a.

do
they
all
speak
in
terms
of
privilege?
justice
harry

blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi,
that
state
levy's
tax
on
the
privilege
of
doing
business
in
mississippi.
the
appellant
is
a
michigan
corporation
engaged
in
the
business
of
transporting
motor
vehicles
by
motor
carrier
for
general
motors
corporation.
general
motors
assembles
outside
mississippi
vehicles
that
are
destined
for
dealers
within
the
state.
those
vehicles
are
shipped
by
rail
to
jackson
where
they
are
loaded
onto
the
appellant's
trucks
and
then
transported
by
the
appellant
to
mississippi
dealers.
the
state
tax
commission
informed
the
appellant
that
it
was
being
assessed
taxes
for
the
sales
of
transportation
services
of
that
kind
during
the
period
from
august
1,
1968
through
july
31,
1972.
the
appellant
paid
the
taxes
under
protest
and
instituted
the
present
action
for
refund
in
a
mississippi
state
court.
the
trial
court
sustained
the
assessments
and
the
mississippi
supreme
court
affirmed.
our
cases
in
this
area
have
not
been
entirely
consistent
but
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
doing
business
in
the
state
does
not
violate
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution
when
it
is
applied
to
an
interstate
activity
such
as
this
one
have
any
substantial
nexus
with
the
taxing
state
with
the
tax
is
fairly
apportioned
where
it
does
not
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce
and
where
it
is
fairly
related
to
the
services
provided
by
the
state.
and
we
have
concluded
that
on
this
record
all
these
conditions
are
satisfied
and
that
the
tax
despite
the
fact
that
is
labeled
as
a
privilege
tax
of
doing
business
in
mississippi
is
not
unconstitutional.
a
case
decided
here
in
1951,
spector
motor
service
against
o'connor
in
340
u.s.
is
specifically
overruled
and
we
thus
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi.
