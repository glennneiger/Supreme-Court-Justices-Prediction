mr.
alan
w.
perry
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi,
upholding
the
validity
of
the
state
tax
laved
on
interstate
commerce
and
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
interstate
commerce.
i
represent
complete
auto,
the
appellant,
which
is
seeking
to
recover
these
taxes
from
state
of
mississippi.
the
state
of
course
is
a
party
for
this
action
through
charles
office,
the
chairman
of
state
tax
commission.
complete
auto
is
a
michigan
corporation
engaged
in
transporting
new
motor
vehicles,
cars
and
trucks
from
the
manufacturers
and
dealers
in
48
states,
operates
pursuant
authority
granted
by
the
state
commerce
commission
does
not
have
any
intrastate
operating
rights
from
mississippi
public
service
commission.
it
has
been
engaged
in
this
business
in
mississippi
since
1940
and
engaged
in
this
transporting
vehicles
from
the
jackson,
mississippi
railhead
round
since
approximately
1960.
during
that
period
of
time,
it
is
has
paid
substantial
income
taxes,
franchise
taxes,
ad
valorem
taxes,
license
plate
fees.
since
the
tax
commission’s
main
contention
is
that
this
activity
of
complete
auto
constituted
intrastate
commerce,
a
brief
reference
to
the
undisputed
facts
concerning
the
activities
of
complete
auto
in
mississippi
and
that
is
to
say,
complete
auto
is
engaged
only
in
the
business
of
transporting
new
motor
vehicles
for
general
motors.
all
of
the
motor
vehicles
that
were
transported
by
complete
auto
manufactured
in
plants
outside
the
state
of
mississippi.
general
motors,
pursuant
to
its
obligations
to
its
dealers,
was
responsible
for
delivering
the
motor
vehicles
to
the
dealer’s
location.
general
motors
chose
the
carriers
to
make
that
delivery.
of
course,
it
is
necessary
to
delivering,
a
bound
carrier
of
motorcare
carrier
since
most
dealer
showrooms
not
located
at
jackson’s
railroad
tunnel
facilities.
in
many
cases
complete
auto
or
another
motor
carrier
will
transport
the
vehicles
the
entire
distance
from
the
manufacturing
plant
to
the
dealer.
in
some
case,
however,
as
in
the
activities
with
which
we
particularly
concerned,
general
motors
found
it
more
economical
to
use
a
rail
carrier
for
a
portion
of
the
journey
on
the
motor
carriers
such
as
complete
auto
to
complete
the
delivery
to
dealer.
general
motors
made
all
the
transportation
arrangements
before
the
vehicles
left
the
plant,
at
the
time
each
vehicle
left
the
plant,
a
label
was
placed
in
or
on
the
motor
vehicle
showing
the
particular
dealer
to
whom
it
must
be
delivered.
the
trial
court
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
once
the
vehicles
were
delivered
to
the
carrier,
that
general
motors
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
transportation
and
the
vehicles
were
in
the
custody,
care
and
control
with
the
carriers
from
the
time
they
left
the
manufacturing
plant
to
the
time
they
left
the
--
until
the
time
they
arrived
the
dealer.
the
transportation
here
at
issue,
a
railroad
transported
the
vehicles
from
the
manufacturing
plant
to
a
rail
ramp
in
jackson,
mississippi.
in
jackson,
the
railway
transferred
the
vehicles
to
complete
auto
which
completed
the
transportation
to
the
dealer.
some
of
the
dealers
were
located
inside
of
mississippi,
some
of
the
dealers
were
located
outside
the
state
of
mississippi.
at
the
trial
of
this
case
in
the
appendix
are
documents
illustrative
of
the
transactions
we
are
talking
about.
they
show
that
for
the
documents
which
are
in
evidence,
the
vehicles
were
shipped
from
manufacturing
plant
at
atlanta,
georgia
by
the
southern
railway
system
to
meridian,
mississippi
which
is
in
the
eastern
portion
of
the
state.
there
they
were
transferred
to
the
illinois
central
railroad
which
carried
the
vehicles
to
jackson,
which
transferred
the
vehicles
to
complete
auto
for
continuation
to
the
dealer
in
the
state
and
out
the
state.
the
statute
at
issue
in
this
case,
provides
in
part
as
follows.
there
is
hereby
laved
and
assessed
and
shall
be
collected
privilege
taxes
for
the
privilege
of
engaging
or
continuing
in
business
or
doing
business
and
then
it
describes
the
tax
to
be
levied
pursuant
to
certain
following
sections.
the
particular
section
with
which
we
are
concerned
provides
in
part
that
upon
every
person
operating
at
pipeline,
airline,
bus,
truck
or
other
transportation
business,
but
the
transportation
of
persons
or
property
for
compensation
between
points
within
the
state
is
hereby
levied
on
sales
and
shall
be
collected
a
tax
equal
to
5%
of
gross
income
of
such
business.
acting
pursuant
to
the
statutes,
the
tax
commission
assessed
the
tax,
against
complete
auto
on
the
gross
receipts
derived
by
complete
auto
for
transporting
the
vehicles
from
jackson
mississippi
to
the
dealers
in
mississippi.
the
state
tax
commission
did
not
assess
any
tax
on
any
portion
of
the
gross
receipts
earned
by
complete
auto
in
transporting
the
vehicles
from
jackson,
mississippi
to
dealers
in
other
state.
the
commission’s
position
in
levying
this
tax
has
always
been
that
it
considers
complete
auto’s
activities
in
continuing
this
intrastate
transportation
from
the
manufacturer
to
dealer
to
the
intrastate
commerce.
it
is
our
position
however
that
the
intrastate
character
of
the
transaction
is
clearly
demonstrated
by
the
undisputed
facts.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
the
statute
was
amended
to
its
present
form
in
about
1955,
as
i
recall
mr.
justice
blackmun.
it
had
a
predecessor’s
statute
which
was
in
effect
at
least
in
1949
when
this
court
decided
intrastate
all
pipeline
case,
that
tax
statute
was
very
similar
to
one
now
in
effect.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
yes
sir,
the
statute
prior
in
1955
said
privilege
once,
this
statute
says
privilege
twice.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
intention
of
general
motors
was
that
the
motor
vehicles
be
transported
from
manufacturing
plant
to
the
dealer.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
only
break
in
the
transportation
was
for
the
purpose
of
transferring
the
vehicles
from
one
carrier
to
another.
it
is
undisputed
that
after
that
transfer
took
place,
the
transportation
to
the
dealer
continued
and
it
is
undisputed
that
general
motors
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
vehicles
after
they
left
its
plant.
the
commission’s
position
in
this
seems
to
be
based
solely
on
its
contention
that
it
lays
the
form
of
the
documents,
established
that
this
is
somehow
intrastate
commerce
and
the
commission’s
brief
asserts
that
this
fact
is
controlling
and
the
form
of
the
documents
is
the
only
pertinent
fact
which
this
court
needs
to
consider.
it
is
undisputed
that
separate
bills
of
lading
or
way
bills
were
prepared
for
the
trail
for
the
railway
journey
and
for
the
truck
journey.
there
were
separate
bills
of
lading.
however,
it
is
also
undisputed
that
the
reason
for
that
was
that
the
joint
tariffs
had
not
been
found
for
the
rail
carrier,
for
the
truck
carrier,
since
there
were
no
joint
tariffs
for
these
two
carriers,
there
could
be
no
joint
rights,
thus
that
could
be
no
joint
documents.
we
have
cited
numerous
cases
in
our
brief
holding
that
the
form
of
the
bill
of
lading
or
the
documents
not
controlling,
does
not
affect
the
character
of
the
continuity
of
intrastate
movement.
we
have
also
cited
numerous
cases
showing
that
a
mere
interchange
from
one
carrier
to
another
does
not
affect
an
intrastate
movement.
the
lack
of
merit
in
the
commission’s
contention
that
this
court
need
to
look
only
to
the
bills
of
lading,
it
is
clearly
evident
from
the
peculiar
and
inconsistent
results
which
it
produces.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
yes
sir
and
the
record,
exhibit
c5
shows
that
complete
auto
which
is
cited
in
the
brief
shows
that
complete
auto
paid
that
tax,
franchise
tax,
ad
valorem
taxes
and
license
plate
fees
of
state.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
they
are
not
privilege
taxes
as
we
see
it
your
honor.
we
do
not
contend
that
those
are
privilege
taxes...
mr.
alan
w.
perry
well,
that
is
somewhat
akin
to
the
railway
express
case
where
they
merely
--
in
railway
express
your
honor
there
is
an
earlier
decision
where
this
court
invalidated
that
virginia
statute.
a
few
years
later
after
the
virginia
legislature
had
revived
the
statute
the
question
came
up
as
to
whether
the
amended
statute
still
levied
to
privilege
tax.
the
court
held
in
a
decision
as
to
which
there
was
some
reservations
in
the
sense
that,
yes,
that
was
indeed
a
property
tax
or
a
tax
levied
in
lieu
of
a
property
tax,
and
therefore,
it
was
not
a
privilege
tax.
question
was
not,
exactly
free
from
that
as
i
recall
mr.
justice
brennan
expressed
some
reservations
and
mr.
justice
stewart
dissented,
“i
am
not
sure
that
merely
exercising
the
words
privilege
from
this
tax
would
make
it
not
a
privilege
tax.
i
think
that
you
still
have
to
look
and
see
if
the
state
is
contending
that
it
is
not
levied
on
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
business,
exactly
what
answer
that
is
it
levied
on.”
mr.
alan
w.
perry
well,
of
course
there
is
the
basic
argument
that
the
state
does
not
have
the
power
to
exclude
a
company
from
engaging
exclusive
intrastate
commerce.
that
is
perhaps
a
formal
argument.
the
particular
practical
problems
that
such
a
tax
creates,
is
that
a
privilege
tax
is
more
selective
than
the
other
taxes
which
this
court
is
held,
such
as
an
income
tax
or
property
tax.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
this
court
has
chosen
i
think
to
draw
a
bright
line
test
because
of
the
dangers
that
a
privilege
tax
is
fairly.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
yes
sir,
the
danger
of
selective
tax.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
no,
sir
that
could
be.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
i
am
afraid
i
do
not
understand
you.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
yes
sir,
surely
that
is
prohibitive,
but
the
spector
decision
on
which
i
always
base
because
it
is
a
lot
further
then
that.
in
that
case,
it
was
held
that
a
tax
placed
on
intrastate
and
intrastate
commerce
in
the
form
of
privilege
tax
is
invalid.
it
is
not
just
a
tax
that
is
levied
on
intrastate
commerce,
it
is
invalid.
it
is
one
that
is
levied
on
interstate
and
intrastate
commerce
if
that
is
in
fact
levied
on
the
privilege
in
engaging
intrastate
commerce.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
no
sir,
i
think
that
is
the
railway
express
case
again
your
honor.
in
that
case
tax
was
reconstructed
as
a
property
tax,
by
making
it
in
lieu
of
the
property
tax
on
certain
intangible
assets
of
the
carrier.
i
think
that
if
state
of
mississippi
worked
within
that
same
statute,
merely
exercising
the
words
privilege,
one
would
have
to
look
at,
what
in
fact
was
being
taxed
by
the
statute,
looking
at
the
entire
structure
of
the
mississippi
taxing
system
to
see
if
they
have
in
fact
found
a
valid
taxable
instant
upon
which
they
had
levied
the
tax.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
yes
sir,
i
think
spector
is
a
pretty
bright
line.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
of
course
that
pretty
(inaudible)
spector
and
memphis
natural
gas
was
of
course
a
franchise
tax
and
after
colonial
pipeline,
those
two
cases
really
are
the
corporate
franchise
instant
as
a
separable
instant
as
i
read
court’s
opinion
in
colonial
pipeline.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
no
sir,
i
think
that
the
--
well,
the
label
is
important
in
that
it
helps
prove
in
this
case
that
it
is
not
levied
on
anything
except
the
privilege.
if
the
state
merely
took
out
the
words
privilege,
i
think
we
would
have
a
harder
time,
but
we
could
still
succeed
if
we
establish
that
it
was
not
levied
on
anything
but
the
privilege.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
well,
i
am
not
going
to
represent
to
the
court
that
i
can
reconcile
every
word
in
both.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
yes
sir,
i
believe
that
to
the
extent
that
memphis
gas
is
inconsistent
with
spector,
i
believe
spector
controls
and
i
believe
that
the
cases
since
spector,
they
are
certainly
consistent
with
spector.
i
think
that
there
are
number
of
cases
in
30s
and
40s,
where
the
court
was
struggling
with
justice
question
whether
to
adopt
a
test
of
balancing
the
burden
on
the
interstate
commerce
against
the
state’s
need
for
revenues
and
the
benefits
provided
to
the
state,
a
case-by-case
adjudication
of
the
validity
of
each
tax.
on
the
other
hand
there
were
those
in
the
court
who
believe
that
the
appropriate
test
would
be
a
bright
line
test
condemning
either
privilege
taxes
or
sometimes
expressed
as
a
direct
tax
in
that
--
do
not
see
that
language
in
the
spector.
i
think
it
is
now
a
privilege
tax.
the
court
wrestled
with
that
problem
apparently
for
a
number
of
years
and
came
down
on
the
bright
line
test
perhaps
in
the
interest
of
affording
certainty
to
the
taxpayer,
perhaps
recognition
that
the
difficulty
of
a
taxpayer
approving
that
a
particular
tax
burden
on
interstate
commerce
is
almost
insurmountable.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
they
could
not
choose
the
valid
incident
which
the
louisiana
legislature
used
and
which
this
court
sustained
which
was…
mr.
alan
w.
perry
yes
sir.
i
do
not
read
colonial
pipelines
justifying
all
three,
but
merely
the
privilege
of
doing
business
in
corporate
form.
the
state
of
mississippi
has
a
corporate
franchise
tax
which
is
levied
on
that
and
i
am
not
sure
that
they
could
tax
it
again
without
it
really
being
a
privilege
tax.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
it
is
the
difficulty
that
answering
that
question
presents
that
i
believe
justifies
the
bright
line
rule,
we
pay
substantial
taxes.
i
am
not
sure
that
anyone
can
quantify
or
that
a
court
can
quantify
the
cost
of
the
state
of
providing
the
benefits
or
the
value
of
the
benefits
which
the
taxpayer
receives
and
we
have
not
tried
to
in
this
case
argue
that
we
only
receive
x
amount
of
benefits
but
we
pay
y
amount
of
dollars.
that
is
a
problem
that
we
would
have
to
address
if
the
court
would
overrule
spector
or
the
bright
line
test.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
no,
sir
i
think…
mr.
alan
w.
perry
yes
sir,
we
will
agree
to
pay
the
other
taxes.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
no
sir,
i
do
not
think
that
we
have
said
that
we
can
quantify
the
amount
we
were
paying
and
that
exceeds
the
amount
of
benefits
that
a
state
is
entitled.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
yes
sir.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
no
sir,
our
objection
is
that
this
is
a
privilege
tax.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
no
sir,
our
objection
also
is
that
this
is
not
a
tax
that
we
would
have
paid
if
the
state
had
been
entitled
to
levy
it
1968
through
1972.
this
tax
would
have
been
passed
along
to
general
motors,
presumably
to
its
leaders
and
presumably
to
new
car
customer
during
1968
to
1972.
we
relied
on
the
bright
line
test,
it
is
too
late
to
pass
the
tax
alone,
in
essence
about
relying
on
spector,
we
are
now,
we
have
no
remedy,
we
are
paying
a
tax
which
we
would
not
been
required
to
pay.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
i
am
sorry
sir
i
did
not.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
yes
sir
that
case
held
that
a
state
may
not
levy
a
privilege
tax
on
interstate
commerce
even
if
the
tax
is
nondiscriminatory
and
fairly
apportioned.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
of
course,
that
decision
was
in
1951
i
believe.
in
1954,
there
was
the
first
railway
express
case
and
since
that
time
the
rule
has
been
recognized
in
other
decisions
of
this
court,
not
the
basis
of
hope.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
well,
a
taxpayer
in
the
situation
of
complete
auto
cannot
afford
to
say
it
well,
it
is
maybe
yes
and
maybe
no,
that
you
have
to
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
to
pass
this
tax
along
or
not.
the
decisions
made
to
rely
on
the
latest
cases
all
of
which
are
after
the
earlier
cases
that
might
indicate
that
there
is
some
doubt
as
to
them
lifting
this
tax.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
yes
sir,
i
think
the
state
would
have
a
difficult
time
contending
that...
mr.
alan
w.
perry
yes
sir,
i
think
that
there
is
difference
between
the
label
and
the
instance
of
the
tax.
as
we
pointed
out,
i
believe
the
privilege
tax
in
a
sense
danger
is
that
other
taxes
that
a
more
aptly
worded
statute
would
avoid,
if
you
have
a
privilege
tax
it
is
always...
mr.
alan
w.
perry
yes
sir
that
is
our
position.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
yes
sir.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
we
read
the
supreme
court
has
conceding
that
this
was
interstate
commerce.
the
tax
commission
even.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
no
sir,
even
the
tax
commission
brief
concedes
that
the
supreme
court
found
it
unnecessary
to
decide
the
issue.
they
certainly
made
no
holding
that
it
was
intrastate
commerce
and
the
chancery
court’s
opinion
is
even
clear
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
patched
although
he
does
not
say
this
is
interstate
commerce
if
that
is
the
substance
of
his
opinion.
well,
the
form
of
the
documents
is
really
the
only
question
mr.
justice
white
on
whether
this
is
interstate
or
intrastate.
they
argue
that
the
because
the
goods
were
consigned
to
general
motors
in
care
of
complete
auto
that
that
makes
this
somehow
intrastate
commerce
and
indeed
they
even
suggest
that
general
motors
took
possession
of
the...
mr.
alan
w.
perry
no
sir,
i
was
going
to
point
out
that
we
were
not
convinced
and
neither
of
the
mississippi
courts
were
convinced
and
we
think
this
court
should
agree
with
mississippi
courts
and
conclude
that
this
is
interstate
commerce
and
only
question
is
whether
a
privilege
tax
can
be
levied?
there
is
no
question
that
this
is
a
privilege
tax.
it
is
been
consistently
construed
as
a
privilege
tax
by
mississippi
supreme
court.
there
is
no
question
that
the
tax
is
a
condition
per
se
between
engage
in
compliance
of
the
statute.
it
is
a
condition
per
se
to
engaging
in
business
and
interstate
commerce
in
mississippi
although
we
do
not
think
it
would
be
controlling
whether
it
were
a
not,
the
tax
commission’s
brief
made
the
argument.
that
it
is
not
a
condition
per
se
and
of
course,
our
brief
cites
the
statute
which
we
believe
establishes
that
it
definitely
is
in
interstate
commerce.
excuse
me,
that
it
definitely
is
a
condition
per
se
to
engaging
business.
our
original
brief
discussed
at
length
the
recognition
which
we
think
that
congress
has
authority
to
spector,
it
has
reviewed
this
entire
area
of
state
tax,
the
interstate
commerce.
we
believe
that
here
we
have
the
positive
inaction
that
this
court
recognized
in
flood
v.
kuhn.
if
this
case,
mr.
justice
blackmun
this
is,
spector
is
an
operation
referring
to
your
thinking
in
colonial
pipelines.
we
think
that
it
is
an
operation
that
has
been
so
long
recognized
by
congress
and
so
much
relied
on
by
the
taxpayers
that
this
court
should
leave
it
to
congress
to
correct
any
of
the
problems
that
might
be
apparent
or
not
apparent
in
the
rule.
by
that
we
do
not
mean
to
conceive.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
we
did
not
ignore
the
state
tax.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
well,
yes
sir
i
suppose,
we
would
have
to
ignore
the
constitution
of
the
state
tax
and
we
choose
to
rely
on
the
constitution.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
yes
sir
and
of
course,
if
you
are
going
to
tack
a
culs
like
that
own
you
got
to
take
it
on
so
that
the
dealer
can
pass
it
along
to
his
customers
or
else
someone
is
going
to
be
left
of
solving
burden
of
it
that
otherwise
should
not.
if
you
had
just
one
customer
and
he
was
going
to
solve
one
way
or
the
other
it
might
cause
such
a
difficult
problem.
for
the
reason
stated
that
that
this
transportation
is
an
interstate
commerce
then
the
state
might
not
levy
a
privilege
tax
on
the
interstate
commerce,
we
suggest
that
the
decision
of
the
supreme
springs
court
of
mississippi
is
totally
inconsistent
with
the
opinions
of
this
court
it
did
not
cite.
it
did
not
cite
railways
express
it
did
not
cite
colonial
pipeline
and
either
we
were
not
eloquent
in
arguing
those
cases
and
we
discussed
in
the
length
as
the
court
deliberately
to
choose
to
ignore
that
prospect
for
the
reasons
stated
we
think
the
decision
should
be
reversed.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
just
a
moment
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
a
fact
that
this
whole
case
turns
on
the
form
of
the
documents,
if
you
have
two
bills
of
lading,
you
are
taxable,
you
have
one
bill
of
lading
you
are
not.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
that
is
his
opinion.
no
sir,
we
do
not
concede
that
at
all.
i
hope
that
it
is
fact
that
we
think
that
has
absolutely
no
merit
at
all,
but
that
is
the
only
factor
that
the
commission
has
looked
at
and
surely
no
the
one
that
the
commission
has
advanced
to
this
court.
mr.
alan
w.
perry
yes
sir,
but
the
tax
is
even
been
repelled
now
since
1972.
we
are
talking
about
money,
we
are
out
of
pocket
from
1968
to
1972.
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
whether
general
motors
had
anyone
present
at
the
point
where
the
vehicles
were
transferred
from
the
railroad
to
motor
carrier
they
did
not.
the
testimony
is
clear
that
they
did
and
the
chancellor,
specifically
found
on
page,
in
his
opinion
on
page
100
of
the
appendix,
that
general
motors
had
absolutely
nothing
further
do
for
it
to
do
with
the
vehicles
after
they
were
transported.
nevertheless
mr.
haddock
said
in
his
brief
and,
said
again
here
today
that
somehow
or
another
the
transportation
ended
in
jackson
because
the
consignee
was
general
motors
in
care
of
complete
auto.
we
think
in
light
of
undisputed
fact
that
contention
has
no
merit.
finally,
with
regard
to
mr.
haddock’s
argument
about
local
activity
which
he
defines
as
the
transportation
itself,
it
seems
to
me
and
he
calls
that
a
commercial
activity,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
just
another
way
of
saying
this
was
intrastate
commerce.
what
he
tried
to
carve
out
is
no
more
than
a
portion
of
intrastate
journey.
he
is
conceded
this
tax
is
not
levied
on
any
such
local
instances
to
use
of
property
or
purchase
of
fuel,
ownership
of
property
or
incidence
on
which
the
tax
could
be
validly
levied.
that
is
we
submit,
it
is
clear
this
tax
is
not
levied
in
any
local
instance.
there
are
number
of
instances
in
the
state
of
mississippi
could
and
does
tax.
this
tax
just
is
not
one
of
those
taxes.
