unknown
speaker
is
there
an
income
tax
in
this?
unknown
speaker
and
why
are
those
taxes
permissible?
unknown
speaker
if
mississippi
just
changes
label
here
and
said
we
are
now
putting
a
tax
on
transportation?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
vice
of
a
privilege
tax
as
opposed
to
say
a
gross
income
tax
on
income
derived
from
transportation
within
the
state
of
mississippi?
unknown
speaker
what
if
this
tax
has
exactly
the
same
incidence,
except
that
it
was
called
a
gross
income
tax
on
income
derived
from
transporting
property
within
the
state
of
mississippi?
unknown
speaker
dangers
of
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
it
is
on
the
privilege
of
doing
interstate
commerce
that
is
all
it
covers,
intrastate
commerce?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
a
tax,
if
the
tax
–
if
that
is
what
the
tax
law
says
by
definition
it
would
reach
on
the
interstate
commerce.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
law
stated
that
we
put
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
engaging
an
intrastate
commerce?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
i
understand
you
then
to
say
that
if
mississippi
changes
its
label,
but
imposed
the
same
tax,
it
would
be
alright?
unknown
speaker
one
last
question,
you
said
this
court
has
made
a
bright
line,
do
you
really
mean
that?
unknown
speaker
what
about
memphis
gas?
unknown
speaker
but
then
you
are
saying
label
is
important?
unknown
speaker
so
in
your
mind
then
memphis
gas
and
spector
are
entirely
reconcilable?
unknown
speaker
but
you
said
it
was
a
bright
line.
unknown
speaker
if
you
would
put
to
prevail,
i
suppose
your
legislature
could
do
what
the
louisiana
legislature
did
in
the
colonial
pipeline
and
setup
alternative
incidents
as
they
did
there
and
then
go
out
and
tax
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
those
were
alternatives...
unknown
speaker
sometimes
the
court
has
this
type
of
discussion
if
not
inquiry
into
what
it
is
that
the
taxpayer
is
getting
for
the
money
he
is
paying
now.
is
it
your
position
that
the
taxes
you
are
already
paying,
the
various
taxes
you
mentioned
balance
that
all
that
you
are
getting
and
that
you
get
nothing
for
this
tax?
unknown
speaker
but
your
real
problem
is
that
you
say
mississippi
getting
too
much
tax
amount?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
agree
to
pay
the
other
taxes?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
a
real
problem?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
did
not
say
that.
you
admit
your
subject
to
taxes
by
the
state
of
mississippi.
unknown
speaker
your
objection
is
this
is
too
much?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
too
much?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
perry,
just
to
--
you
just
talked
about
spector
instead
of
talking
about
guideline?
unknown
speaker
what
decision
is
that
you
say
that
you
relied
on
the
spector
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
--
go
ahead
finish
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
it
is
necessarily
a
basis
of
a
reliance
which
you
are
going
to
assert
in
a
constitutional
sense
to
pick
out
the
case
that
is
the
most
favorable
to
you
and
say
we
relied
on
that
and
in
affect
ignore
the
memphis
gas
case?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
your
brief
in
affect
saying.
the
legislature
was
foolish
enough
to
say
we
are
levying
this
tax
expressly
upon
the
privilege
of
doing
an
exclusively
interstate
business
and
that
is
all
they
say,
it
is
unconstitutional
under
spector
and
the
line
of
case,
i
see
under
the
holding.
unknown
speaker
no
but
is
it
not
want
your
argument
is
based
on
what
we
said
last
time
in
colonial?
unknown
speaker
if
spector,
if
you
are
right
in
relying
on
spector,
once
you
establish
that
that
is
what
this
tax
is
and
that
is
the
way
that
the
tax
statute
is
written
you
are
entitle
to
win?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
certainly
the
bright
line,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
you
read
the
mississippi
supreme
court
as
saying
that
has
been
ceding
or
accepting
that
this
transportation
was
the
last
leg
of
an
interstate
journey?
unknown
speaker
i
am
saying
that
it
does
not
say
that
this
last
leg
was
not
part
of
interstate
commerce?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
what
the
mississippi
courts
held?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
relied
upon
then
in
the
sense
you
just
ignore
the
state
tax?
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
you
would
not
pay.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
at
least
you
relied
on
it
in
the
sense
you
did
not
pass
it
on?
unknown
speaker
mr.
haddock
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
these
vehicles
go
to
meridian
and
they
change
from
one
railroad
to
another,
then
why
do
you
not
tax
the
meridian
to
jackson?
unknown
speaker
then
you
rely
on
bill
of
lading?
unknown
speaker
my
other
question
is
that
if
one
of
these
trucks,
they
have
three
vehicles
to
be
delivered
in
mississippi
and
two
to
go
to
louisiana
all
on
the
same
truck.
unknown
speaker
what
right
do
you
have
to
tax
those
if
you
do
not
tax
the
others;
they
are
all
on
the
same
truck.
unknown
speaker
and
they
all
are
using
the
mississippi
roads.
unknown
speaker
the
same
vehicle
could
be
used
in
that
regard?
unknown
speaker
what
if
each
of
the
dealer
sends
some
kind
of
a
vehicle
to
this
point
in
mississippi
and
taking
the
cars
to
their
own
distribution
point
themselves,
would
you
levy
any
extra
tax
on
them?
unknown
speaker
do
any
of
them
do
that,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
now
that
is,
what
you
are
saying
now
is
contrary
what
you
said
in
your
brief
and
i
will
read
it.
it
is
apparently
clear
that
the
mississippi
court
found
it
unnecessary
to
determine
the
question
of
interstate
or
intrastate
commerce.
unknown
speaker
now
you
just
told
us
you
think
that
they
held
that
it
was
intrastate.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
haddock
at
the
next
page
they
say,
rely
on
a,
as
they
are
using
their
own
language,
the
case
involving
the
final
leg
of
an
interstate
shipment
is
--
be
done
which
sounded
to
me
as
though
this
they
are
taxing
it,
what
they
are
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
but
they
held
that
before
the
united
state
supreme
court
called
the
first
leg
interstate
shipment,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
did
not
the
united
state
supreme
court
called
the
first
leg
of
an
interstate
shipment
and
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
what
is
interstate,
what
is
intrastate
be
governed
by
the
state
court’s
decision
or…
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
facts
of
spector,
were
they
pickups
from
points
of
origin
and
then
delivery
to
terminals
within
connecticut
and
then
ship
them
out
of
state?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
commercial
activity
here?
unknown
speaker
was
there
a
general
motor
agent
in
jackson,
mississippi
can
handle
it?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
anybody
did
anything
or
was
it
just
a
routine
thing.
what
could
have
happened
if
in
a
railroad
from
jackson
to
wherever
this
went?
it
would
be
no
problem,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
one
of
these
cars,
one
of
these
vehicles
was
delivered
to
biloxi,
mississippi
by
this
truck.
if
a
railroad
had
picked
this
up
at
jackson
and
delivered
in
biloxi,
no
tax?
unknown
speaker
that
there
would
not
be
any
tax
between
jackson
and
biloxi?
unknown
speaker
my
final
question,
if
they
find
it
cheaper
to
get
complete
auto
to
ship
them
from
meridian
to
jackson,
what
then?
unknown
speaker
the
same
deal
was
made?
unknown
speaker
there
would
be
taxed?
unknown
speaker
and
they
would
be
doing
the
exact
same
thing
that
railroad
is
doing
now
without
tax?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
they
deliver
it
from
point
to
point.
unknown
speaker
one
is
a
truck
and
one
is
a
railroad.
unknown
speaker
if
for
the
first
time
the
cars
are
shipped
in
meridian
and
delivered
to
another
area
and
they
deliver
it
by
railroad
to
jackson
and
they
are
not
subject
to
this
tax.
suppose
they
find
that
it
would
be
cheaper
to
transfer
these
in
meridian
to
a
truck
of
the
complete
auto
transit
company
and
shipped
to
meridian,
they
would
be
taxed?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
a
meridian,
mississippi
to
jackson,
mississippi?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
difference
between
pick
them
up
in
meridian
and
pick
them
in
jackson?
unknown
speaker
you
said
you
could
not
tax
the
first
one
but
you
could
tax
the
second
one.
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand
mr.
haddock
that
in
your
answers
to
the
questions
of
my
brother
marshall
that
you
can
see
that
this
is
that
if,
what
is
involved
in
this
case
is
interstate
commerce
then
your
state
has
no
power
to
tax
it?
unknown
speaker
then
your
state
has
no
power
to
tax,
that
is
what
you
have
just
told
justice
marshall
i
think.
unknown
speaker
what
have
you
told
him?
unknown
speaker
why
do
not
you
make
that
practice
of
doing
it
under
the
law?
unknown
speaker
the
law
requires
you
to
tax
it
unless
it
is
unconstitutional
to
do
so,
do
they
not?
unknown
speaker
because
it
is
interstate
commerce.
unknown
speaker
so
if
this
is
interstate
commerce
you
could
not
tax
this,
you
concede
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
justice
marshall’s
had
hypothetical
case
that
he
asked
you
about,
was
a
purely
local
activity
in
continuation
of
interstate
commerce.
it
goes
by
rail
to
meridian
and
by
truck
from
meridian
to
jackson
and
you
may
call
that
a
segment
from
meridian
to
jackson
mississippi
by
truck?
unknown
speaker
you
would
not
tax
it,
you
would
not
tax
that
transaction
embodied
in
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question.
that
is
what
you
told
him,
did
you
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understood
your
answers
to
justice
marshall’s
questions.
it
boiled
down
to
conceding
that
if
this
is
interstate
commerce
involved
in
this
case.
you
do
not
have
power
to
tax
it
under
your
statute
and
you
tell
me
if…
unknown
speaker
well,
then
why
would
not
you
tax
the
truck
trip
from
meridian
to
jackson
in
his
question?
you
have
an
absolute
duty
to
apply
this
tax
uniformly
and
fairly
accept
when
you
cannot
constitutionally
do
so,
do
you
not?
unknown
speaker
then
why
would
you
not
tax
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
told
him
you
would
not
tax
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
ask
you
again
why
have
you
adopted
that
policy?
unknown
speaker
between
what
and
what,
between
local
commerce
and
interstate
commerce?
unknown
speaker
and
if
it
is
interstate
commerce
you
cannot
tax
it,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
purpose
for
which
the
revenues
are
used,
does
it,
that
is
not
any
criteria,
is
it?
whether
they
are
used
for
pre-school
license
or
for
building
roads.
well
that
makes
no
difference.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
it
make
any
difference
constitutionally,
that
is
the
question
i
am
asking
you?
unknown
speaker
was
your
theory,
over
the
road
trucker
that
just
is
holding
cargo
from
one
end
of
your
state
to
the
other,
is
going
through
your
state,
would
be
subject
to
this
tax?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
under
your
theory,
in
your
private
theory
the
state
would
have
the
power.
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
but
you
would
say
that
you
should
be
able
to
under
this
very
tax
to
say
that
that
trucker
who
does
not
do
anything
in
mississippi
except
driving
through
it
to
pay
a
privilege
for
doing
business
in
mississippi.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
you
do
not
do
it
on
the
airline,
under
your
private.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
for
the
privilege
of
originating
shipments
out
of
this
state
and
shipping
them
direct
to
an
automobile
dealer
in
the
state?
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
do
not,
but
how
about
--
is
that
constitutional
for
you
to
do
it?
unknown
speaker
or
further
even
though,
you
call
it
the
privilege?
unknown
speaker
unintentionally
i
am
sure,
you
have
confused
me,
mr.
haddock.
let
me
give
you,
this
concrete
hypothetical
case.
suppose
this
appellant
sent
its
whatever
kind
of
vehicles
they
have
up
to
detroit,
picked
up
a
load
of
cars,
had
a
whole
convoy
of
them
and
dropped
them
off
at
various
dealers
in
mississippi,
would
you
tax
that?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you
do
not?
unknown
speaker
and
if
that
truck
buys
gas
in
mississippi,
the
state
can
certainly
charge
a
tax
on
the
gas
purchase,
can
they?
unknown
speaker
why
cannot
it
charge
it
on
the
portion
of
the
revenues
derived
from
the
portion
of
the
journey
that
takes
place
inside
mississippi?
unknown
speaker
the
case
that
troubles
you
the
most
is
the
spector
case?
unknown
speaker
is
the
case
that
troubles
you
the
most
is
the
spector
case?
unknown
speaker
this
is
what
you
are
doing,
you
are
not
asking
us
to
overrule
spector,
i
guess?
unknown
speaker
so
you
do
think,
spector
ought
to
be
overruled?
unknown
speaker
you
think
it
is
very
helpful
to
you
in
this
case
mr.
thomas.
unknown
speaker
i
think
a
little
earlier
you
said
found
your
greater
support
to
that
case.
unknown
speaker
let
me
reverse
my
hypothetical
to
you
and
suppose
that
let
me
say
that
the
cars
came
by
truck
from
detroit
to
meridian
or
jackson
and
then
because
of
bad
roads
or
other
reasons,
they
shipped
it,
they
took
them
off
the
trucks
and
put
them
on
a
railroad
and
took
them
the
rest
of
the
way,
would
you
tax
the
rail
journey?
unknown
speaker
what
this
comes
down
to
really
then
is
if
detroit
has
the
good
judgment
to
make
out
a
bill
of
lading
to
the
consignee
as
a
dealer
then
they
are
going
to
be
free
of
the
tax,
they
can
get
around
the
tax
very
easily?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
your
statute
and
that
is
because
the
wording
perhaps
of
your
statute
which
purports
to
tax
only
transportation
between
points
within
the
state,
perhaps
it
does
not
purport
to
tax
to
the
limit
of
mississippi’s
constitutional
authority.
unknown
speaker
any
shipment
from
outside
the
state
as
soon
as
it
crosses
the
border
of
mississippi
has
to
come
a
point
in
mississippi.
unknown
speaker
but
maybe
but
from
that
point
on
to
the
destination,
it
is
a
transportation
between
two
points
in
mississippi?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
the
law
says.
you
said
it
has
be
a
commercial
transaction.
unknown
speaker
between
points
within
the
state
has
been
given
on
particularized
within
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
it
has
got
to
be
from,
in
order
to
consignee
or
from
is
that
to
be
a
shipment
and
deliver.
unknown
speaker
no
sir,
if
you
have
a
same
way,
between
two
points.
unknown
speaker
mr.
haddock,
it
is
not
easy.
in
my
view
or
either
you
or
your
opposition
to
take
a
positive
stand
in
the
light
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
if
you
are
confused,
i
am
ready
to
say
that
i
am
too.
unknown
speaker
you
are
not,
conceding
that?
