mr.
norman
j.
watkins
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
court's
indulgence
i
would
like
to
initially
note
that
i
intend
to
submit
the
jurisdictional
issues
that
i
raised,
however,
i
of
course
will
answer
the
questions,
the
court
might
have
that
includes
the
habeas
corpus
issue
and
the
eleventh
amendment
issue.
i
intend
to
devote
my
entire
argument
time
to
the
merits.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
i
had
not
intended
to
discuss
it,
in
connection
with
the
mootness
issue?
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that
is
correct.
however,
i
believe
that
members
of
the
class
clearly
are
under
the
age
of
13.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
well,
i
think
it
can
in
this
case
your
honor
because
the
court
when
defining
the
class,
also
noted
certain
unmentioned
individuals
but
patient
numbers
i
believe
some
of
those
in
the
record
were
under
the
age
of
13.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
this
suit
was
commenced
in
1972
when
the
five
named
plaintiffs
challenged
their
admission
to
haverford
state
hospital
which
was
initiated
under
sections
402
and
403
of
pennsylvania's
mental
health
act
and
allowed
generally
parents
to
admit
their
children
upon
the
advise
of
a
recommending
psychiatrist
or
physician
whichever
was
appropriate.
the
lawsuit
basically
challenged
under
the
due
process
clause
of
fourteenth
amendment,
the
authority
of
their
parents
and
the
physician
to
commence
and
effectuate
this
admission
without
the
full
panoply
of
due
process.
in
pennsylvania
under
sections
402
and
403,
a
parent
may
admit
his
child
provided
that
medical
recommendations
are
concurrent
with
that
desire.
shortly
after
the
litigation
was
commenced
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
alluding
to
earlier,
regulations
were
adopted
by
the
defendants
which
greatly
expanded
the
rights
of
children
under
the
mental
health
and
mental
retardation
act.
generally
those
regulations
and
they
are
set
out
in
full
provide
that
a
child
over
13
is
given
elaborate
notice
and
upon
objection
either
written
or
oral,
is
automatically
appointed
counsel
if
he
is
unable
to
afford
counsel
and
is
provided
a
full
adversarial
hearing
within
which
to
contest
both
a
parental
recommendation
and
the
medical
recommendation.
the
notice
which
is
provided
to
child
and
must
be
explained
to
the
child
its
extremely
detail,
provides
the
name
of
the
physician
who
is
recommending
the
commitment
and
provides
the
name
of
the
applicant,
the
counsel,
how
to
get
a
hold
of
counsel
and
various
other
procedural
protections.
moreover,
in
pennsylvania
now
and
shortly
after
the
lawsuit,
an
admission
of
a
child
may
not
proceed
on
the
basis
of
one
medical
recommendation
alone.
it
must
be
independently
concordant
by
a
second
medical
recommendation,
plus
it's
under
statement
to
say
that
in
pennsylvania,
there
are
certain
legal
impediments
for
a
parent
who
is
intent
on
dumping
a
child
in
an
institution.
the
lower
court
view
extensively
both
the
statute
and
the
regulations
and
held
that
both
together
fail
to
meet
constitutional
muster.
there
was
one
judge
dissenting
holding
basically
that
the
regulations
when
viewed
in
the
proper
context
of
parent-child
relationship
involved
in
this
case
did
indeed
meet
constitutional
muster.
for
this
court,
there
are
primarily
two
issues
on
the
merits
of
this
case.
first,
does
the
liberty
interest
that
is
involved
in
this
involved
the
child's
liberty
interest,
in
the
proper
context
warrants
further
protection
under
the
constitution
of
this
country.
if
the
statutory
and
regulatory
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
the
new
procedures
and
the
old
procedures,
taken
together,
the
statute
and
the
regulation.
i
think
the
record
is
very
clear
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
court
and
certainly
the
dissent
exhaustively
studied
the
regulations
and
considered
them
in
its
opinion.
as
i
recall
the
lower
court's
opinion,
they
rejected
the
regulations
primarily
because
one,
they
did
not
applied
to
children
under
13
and
two,
they
did
not
provide
a
time
certain
when
the
adversarial
hearing
would
take
place.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
there
is
a
new
statute
that
applies
only
to
the
mentally
ill
and
as
i
pointed
out,
that
is
approximately
20%
of
the
plaintiff
class.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that
is
correct
your
honor.
and
the
new
statute
changes
in
no
way
whatsoever,
the
relationship
of
the
child-parent
state
who
is
under
14.
so
for
all
intention
purposes,
a
very
small
portion
of
the
plaintiff
class
has
been
affected
by
the
intervening
legislation.
the
question
is,
is
this
statutory
and
regulatory
framework
deficient?
are
parents
to
be
limited
in
the
mental
health
area
where
they
certainly
are
not
in
the
physical
health
area?
surely,
if
i
as
a
parent
seek
to
admit
my
child
for
a
serious
physical
element
that
may
require
total
incarceration,
an
rh-negative
problem
or
something
where
i
have
no
antibiotic
and
any
ability
to
ward
off
diseases,
surely,
no
one
would
contend
that
a
hearing
must
proceed
that
recommendation.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
the
question
as
i
am
approaching
and
i
agree
with
you
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
liberty
interest
involved
at
all
here?
the
conflict
was
the
court
--
lower
court
failed
to
perceive
and
i
believe
this
is
what
you
are
getting
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
conflict
is
between
the
parent
and
child,
not
between
the
parent
and
state.
in
effect,
there
maybe
no
state
action
as
compared
to
the
gault
situation
where
you
have
got
a
state
coming
into
the
family
and
taking
the
child.
however,
it
is
clear
that
the
state
is
treating
the
patients
and
the
plaintiffs
pursuant
to
state
law
and
the
state
is
in
fact
holding
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
well,
there
are
enough
set
procedures
but
that
is
possible.
first
obviously
the
parents
would
be
notified.
in
fact
--
well,
it
could
run
the
gamut
of
calling
the
police.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that
is
correct.
i
think
it
would
certainly
be
an
ad
hoc
procedure.
i
am
sure
that
in
some
counties
if
a
child
ran
away
from
the
general
hospital,
the
police
are
called,
the
parents
are
called.
the
police
may
well
return
the
child
to
the
hospital
especially
if
the
child
is
in
hospital
garb
for
instance.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
to
a
private
institution?
insofar
as
the
private
institutions
are
regulated
by
the
common
wealth
of
pennsylvania
and
must
conform
their
activities,
that
is
they
must
abide
by
the
regulatory
scheme
that
we
have
established.
for
instance,
a
private
facility
such
as
the
deveraux
school
under
pennsylvania
law
must
abide
by
the
regulations
that
were
promulgated.
now,
i
am
not
going
to
stand
here
and
say
that,
that
is
the
same
as
a
line
authority.
there
is
a
great
and
vast
difference,
but
they
certainly
must
conform
to
state
law
and
the
state
has
the
power
of
listing
a
license.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
well,
there
are
certain
qualitative
regulations
but
primarily
i
appertained
with
the
procedures.
they
must
follow
the
procedures
that
we
establish
for
admission.
they
must
follow
the
procedures
for
admission.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
no.
there
are
institutions
discussed
in
the
record
that
are
private
institutions.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
i
do
not
believe
they
are.
haverford
state
hospital
is
a
public
institution.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
with
respect
to
state
action
or
with
respect
to
the
company?
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
i
think
not.
i
think
that
i
must
back
up
and
say
that
it
is
our
contention,
the
commonwealth
contends
that
when
it
is
a
parental,
a
joint
decision
between
the
parent
and
the
doctor,
the
parent
has
the
authority
to
admit
anywhere,
public
--
well,
let
me
correct
myself.
the
constitutional
issues
certainly
are
the
same.
i
would
view
them
the
same.
the
problem
with
the
lower
court's
decision
and
the
fundamental
error
that
it
made,
was
it
in
somewhat
simplistic
fashion
i
think,
applied
this
court's
rationale
in
gault
to
a
situation
where
gault
clearly
doesn't
doesn't
apply.
gault
analyzed
a
conflict
between
the
child,
the
parents
and
the
state
which
was
imposing
incarceration
upon
the
child
without
notice
to
the
parent,
yanking
the
parent
and
the
child,
if
you
will,
from
the
family
scene
into
an
institution.
there
can
be
nothing
that
is
more
close
to
a
criminal
proceeding
than
that.
i
don't
want
to
get
hung
up
on
the
criminal
civil
label,
that's
not
the
critical
thing
here.
what
takes
place
in
a
delinquency
proceeding
is
a
finding
of
guilt.
the
question
is
did
this
occur,
is
it
illegal
and
did
the
defendant
do
it
or
did
the
juvenile
do
it.
that's
not
at
all
the
issue
in
a
commitment
proceeding
or
admission
proceeding.
the
critical
findings
are
whether
or
not
this
child
is
indeed
mentally
ill
and
whether
or
not
in
the
professional
recommendation
of
the
physicians,
this
child
needs
inpatient
psychiatric
or
psychological
care.
i
fail
to
see
where
an
intervening
hearing
is
going
to
fail
safe
that
proceeding.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that's
very
good
question.
it's
our
view
that
and
i
think
the
cases
throughout
the
country
clearly
demonstrate
this
that
adults,
adults,
a
competent
adult
has
the
right
to
reject
medical
treatment.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
well,
for
the
purposes
of
mental
health
act,
yes,
14-year
olds
and
above
are
treated
exactly
as
adults.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
in
most
other
ways,
in
most
other
ways
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
no
he
can't,
no
he
can't.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
no,
he
can't
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that's
correct.
the
pennsylvania
legislature
has
decided
that
and
i
think
on
sound
expert
opinion,
that
the
age
of
14
is
about
when
an
objection
to
a
certain
types
of
treatment
would
be
reliable.
the
record
in
fact
contains
testimony
that
13,
14,
that
age
is
about
when
a
child
can
determine
his
own
destiny.
now
unfortunately,
and
some
of
you
may
disagree
with
pennsylvania
legislature,
does
juvenile
will
drink,
drive
and
vote,
but
be
that
as
it
may
in
answer
to
your
question,
the
determination
at
an
involuntary
proceeding,
i
submit
is
not
whether
or
not,
the
judge
isn't
determining
whether
or
not
this
patient
needs
care.
the
judge
is
determining
is
this
patient
able
to
reject
that
care.
does
he
know
what
he
is
doing
when
he
rejects
that
care?
if
he
does,
that's
his
business.
certainly
no
one
can
force
me
to
have
my
broken
leg
fixed,
if
i
don't
wish
to
have
it
fixed.
that
issue
doesn't
arise
in
a
juvenile
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that's
correct.
of
course
that
creates
a
presumption
problem.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that's
absolutely
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
absolutely
correct!
however
in
this
case,
which
you
have
got,
is
the
lower
court
saying,
we
are
going
to
presume
that
parents
can't
make
this
decision.
we
are
going
to
presume
that
a
strange
lawyer
or
public
defender
is
better
able
to
make
this
decision.
we
are
going
to
presume
that
the
efficacy
process
is
better
able
to
workout,
what
is
admittedly
and
concededly
an
extremely
difficult
family
decision.
this
is
a
decision
that
many
families
have
to
go
through.
the
lower
court's
order
has
kind
of
effectively
raised
an
adversarial
barrier
that
i
suggest
is
worthless
in
terms
of
its
goal.
it's
goal
is
admittedly
to
prevent
erroneous
commitments.
however,
the
record
in
this
case
doesn't
show
one
erroneous
commitment.
the
court
pointed
to
not
one
erroneous
commitment.
the
court
said
that
it
may
occur
and
that
the
parents
may
act
against
the
best
interest
of
their
child.
well,
the
parents
may
act
against
the
best
interest
of
their
children
by
sending
them
into
a
military
academy,
but
that
is
not
necessarily
a
basis
upon
which
to
impose
an
adversarial
proceeding
that
requires
parents
deciding
on
long-term
education
plans
for
the
children
to
appoint
a
lawyer
for
the
child,
and
let's
flush
this
out
in
court
of
law.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
absolutely
correct,
absolutely
correct.
this
case
differs
from
what
the
lower
court
viewed
and
i'll
conclude
with
this
remark.
the
lower
court
applied
gault
in
toto,
just
slapped
the
order
of
gault
right
over,
right
over
this
fact
situation
totally
ignoring
the
fact
that
the
parents
instituted
this
proceeding,
the
parents
decided,
i
want
my
child
in
an
institution
along
with
a
medical
recommendation.
the
court
ignored
that
and
viewed
it
as
if
the
state
had
come
in
and
said
to
the
parents
your
child
will
be
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
absolutely,
absolutely,
pennsylvania
clearly
provides
that.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
not
only
can
but
should.
the
lower
court's
decision
is
totally
unwise
in
its
breadth
and
scope.
for
instance
it
lumps
mentally
retarded
and
mentally
ill
together.
there
is
a
tremendous
amount
of
questions
the
way
that
was
watched.
thank
you.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
exclusively.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
well,
the
parents
couldn't
have
the
effectuated
the
commitment
without
the
concurrence
of
the
state
in
a
state
facility
and
as
the
state
law
pursuant
to
which
the
state
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
no
absolutely
not.
however,
here
you
have
got
state
psychiatrist
examining
the
child
and
recommending
the
care.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
excuse
me
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
didn't
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
well,
they
may
and
i
assume
--
possibly
if
that
were
a
part
of
the
system,
if
before
you
could
put
your
child
in
a
public
school
let's
say,
you
have
to
go
to
the
school
and
school
had
to
say
we
want
your
child,
your
child
needs
us,
that's
a
little
more
state
action
than
the
present
system
which
is
i
am
living
in
this
district,
i
am
going
to
send
my
child
to
that
school
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
this
issue
was
not
raised
at
the
trial
court
level.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
i
believe
that
i
recall
in
one
of
the
early
colloquies.
i
of
course
did
not
try
the
case,
but
i
believe
one
of
the
early
colloquies
between
the
courts
there
was
some
discussion
of
it.
the
resolution
i
think
was
entirely
correct.
you've
got
state
institution,
the
state
psychiatrist
recommending
the
treatment
and
in
many
cases
concededly,
strongly
recommend
the
treatment.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
the
second
issue
is
assuming
that
there
is
an
impact
on
liberty,
was
lower
court's
order
justified
and
just
briefly
there
is
a
checklist
which
are
more
fully
and
i
was
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that's
correct,
i
mean,
is
it
unwise
in
its
breadth,
its
unsound
in
its
scope,
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that's
correct
mr.
justice
brennan,
however
i
believe
that
the
questions
covered
stated
in
a
jurisdictional
statement
are
sufficiently
broad
to
cover.
the
statements
says
they
are
framed
in
the
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
yes.
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
i
did
not
go
to
each
of
the
elements
of
the
board
or
anything
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white,
however
i
agree
with
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
in
this
case
particularly
it
is
extreme
very
difficult
to
separate
the
elements
--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
not
with
respect
to
the
retroactive
application.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
yes,
it's
our
contention
and
i
think
the
brief
makes
it
entirely
clear
that
the
present
system
of
pennsylvania
meets
the
requirements.
therefore,
i
would
as
a
necessary
corollary
of
that
position,
anything
over
and
above
that
must
be
erroneous.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
anything
over
and
above,
is
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
i
would
like
to
address
the
question
of
reasons
for
placement.
this
has
been
discussed
in
the
briefs
and
i
discussed
it
a
little
more
pointedly
in
my
reply
brief.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
administrators
of
these
institutions
unfortunately
for
the
litigators
filed
the
documents
which
said
reasons
for
placement
that
had
a
cursory
statement,
insurance
or
what
have
you.
but
what
the
district
court
ignored
and
what
the
plaintiff
didn't
bring
to
your
attention
just
now
is
that
in
the
most
complete
part
of
record,
there
are
also
medical
diagnosis
of
the
patients.
those
were
ignored
in
the
opinions.
these
diagnosis
and
i
don't
prefer
to
be
able
to
analyze
and
i
think
they
are
clearly
relevant
to
whether
or
not,
the
child
needed
the
care
that
was
alternately
ordered
and
i
would
just
urge
that
the
record
most
completely
is
reflected
in
the
10
patient
summaries
where
you
have
not
only
the
court
reason
for
placement
which
is,
for
example,
if
i
have
a
stomach
ache
and
go
to
the
doctor
and
the
doctor
ultimately
ends
up
removing
my
gall
bladder.
obviously,
it's
going
to
show
on
my
admission
note
that
i
came
in
for
a
stomach
ache
but
it's
not
fair
to
conclude
that
surgery
was
performed
on
me
for
a
stomach
ache.
it
was
performed
on
me
because
i
had
an
infected
or
what
have
you,
gall
bladder
which
would
show
up
in
the
medical
records.
secondly,
i
agree
with
the
chief
justice
that
an
overdose
of
due
process
can
be
very
dangerous.
in
fact
it's
lethal
to
one
very
valuable
program
in
pennsylvania.
that's
the
program
the
respite
care.
this
order
entirely
forecloses
that
program.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
respite
care,
and
that
allows
a
parent
of
a
severely
retarded
juvenile
to
place
his
child
in
an
institution
for
say,
four
or
weeks
a
year
to
allow
the
parent,
the
necessary
respect
go
on.
the
ironic
effect
of
this
is
going
to
possibly
be
total
commitment
of
that
juvenile
rather
than
the
partial
commitment
that
had
here
been
the
case.
i
would
also
like
to
address
the
point
that
pennsylvania,
the
present
rules
in
pennsylvania
allow
for
a
master.
it's
quite
true
that
they
do
allow
for
a
master
but
that
master
as
i
understand
the
rules
would
have
no
decisional
authority
and
therefore
under
this
court's
order,
the
judge
would
have
to
be
involved.
the
experts
in
this
case--
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
