further
in
relation
to
what?
the
old
procedures
or
the
new
ones?
chief

in
pennsylvania,
if
the
parents
with
their
private
physicians
take
a
child
within
this
age
category
to
a
private
hospital,
private
institution.
is
there
a
state
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
right.
courts
have
found
guardians
(inaudible)
in
some
of
the
situations,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
the
subject
whether
adults
or
minor
is
not
capable
of
making
the
judgments
necessarily
alone.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
the
choice
of
a
private
school
against
the
public
school
or
vice
versa?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
why
you
say
that
the
appropriate
remedy
is
the
case
by
case
treatment
by
way
of
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
can't
generalize
about
such
a
sensitive
problem
such
as
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
i
think
mr.
segal
is
going
to
continue
with
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
will
have
ten
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.

is
the
state

this
mandate
given

chief

warren
e.

mandated
to

the
subject
of
the
proceeding
present

the
courtroom.
chief

they
seem
to
be.
chief

warren
e.
burger
mr.
ferleger.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
agree
with
the
state
of
pennsylvania
that
referees
could
not
be
appointed
by
the
state
courts
to
perform
the
function
mandated
by
the
federal
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
must
they
be
reprocessing
as
they
don't
want
to
be
reprocessed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
a
mentally
ill
15
year
old
child
consternate
on
a
valiant
waiver?
you
said
that
the
lawyer
can
waive
for
that
child?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
actually
quite
a
substantial
hearing
process
to
make
just
that
preliminary
determination
might
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
psychiatric
testimony?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
testimony
of
the
parents?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
not
the
the
psychiatrist
indicate
that
there
may
be
a
difference
between
the
traumatic
impact
on
young
children
as
against
other
mentally
or
emotionally
disturbed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
otherwise?
do
you
mean
that
there
is
no
traumatic--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
...impact
on
a
15
year
old
child
that
goes
through
a
hearing
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
page
you
are
going
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
page
again?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
we
affirm
this
judgment,
the
state
of
pennsylvania
must
do
everything
that
is
stipulated
in
the
judgment
and
the
only
way
that
i
see
of
avoiding
that
would
be
to
affirm
it
in
part
and
strike
down
parts
of
it,
do
you
disagree
with
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
that
expert
say
anything
about
the
trauma
of
14
year
old,
13
year
old
going
through
a
contested
hearing
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
authority
of
the
united
states
circular
district
judge
to
attempt
to
that
kind
of
specificity
as
distinguished
from
saying
the
procedure
you
have
is
bad
because
it
violates
the
constitution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
none
of
those
are
constitutional
standards
per
say,
are
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
are
merely
rogatory
suggestions
by
ut
i
think
those
who
are
interested
in
the
subject
matter,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
the
states
need
the
benediction
of
the
federal
court
in
order
to
engage
in
experimentation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
court
might
observe,
the
federal
court
might
observe
that
that's
the
system
of
federalism
that
they
have
no
authority
to
tell
them
to
experiment,
have
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
not
see
any
risk
at
all
of
the
overdose
of
due
process
might
be
just
as
dangerous
as
an
overdose
of
insulin
shot
treatment
on
a
mental
patient?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
these
were
hypothetical
cases,
were
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
they
findings
on
evidence
relating
to
particular
members
of
this
class?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
state
have
anything
further?
you
have
about
four
minutes
left.
chief

your
time
is
up.
chief
justice
warren
e.
