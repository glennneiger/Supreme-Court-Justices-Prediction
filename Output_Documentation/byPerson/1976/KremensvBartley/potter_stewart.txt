on
the
other
hand
if
you
are
dealing
with
either
mentally
ill
people
or
mentally
retarded
people,
even
adults
have
some
question
about
their
ability
to
make
decisions
through
themselves?
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
was
decided
on
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
you
just
point
it
out
that
it
was
--
everything
happened
was
at
the
behest
of
the
parents.
i
was
wondering
where
is
the
state
action
because
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
course
applies
only
as
against
a
state?
justice
potter
stewart
is
parents'
decision
to
send
a
child
to
public
school
is
safe
decision?
justice
potter
stewart
you
didn't
raise
any
question,
excuse
me?
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
the
state
action,
did
you
raise
this
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
or
haven't
till
i
just
asked
the
question?
justice
potter
stewart
i
did
not
understand
maybe
i
misunderstood.
i
thought
your
point,
simply
was
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law
pennsylvania
requires
a
private
facilities,
provide
the
same
procedures
as
do
public
facilities,
got
therefore
any
decision
in
this
case,
respecting
public
facilities,
were
as
a
matter
of
state
law
affect
the
private
facilities
in
pennsylvania.
it
is
not
unlike
--
it
is
not
a
matter
of
acting
under
color
of
state
law,
they
are
just
simply
bound
as
a
by
a
state
law
or
behave
the
same
way.
is
not
that?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
only
way
a
private
organization
can
hold
a
present
against
his
will
is
by
virtue
of
state
he
is
already
in?
justice
potter
stewart
he
cannot
get
out.
in
other
words
it
is
same
by
virtue
of
state
law.
it
is
not
merely
requirement
but
it
is
a
protection
for
the
private
institution
from
a
supra
false
imprisonment
something
like
that.
