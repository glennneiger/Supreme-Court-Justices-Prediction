mr.
bernard
g.
segal
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
begins
the
first
year
of
its
third
century
in
an
unprecedented
role
in
appearing
this
court.
it
is
the
first
time
and
to
that
extent
unique
and
perhaps
emphasizes
the
importance.
it
appears
here
in
its
administrative
role
under
article
5
of
our
new
constitution.
i
say
new,
it
was
adopted
in
1968
and
we
are
going
to
still
getting
accustomed
to
some
parts
of
it
since
it
replaced
a
constitution
almost
a
century
old.
under
that
constitution,
the
supreme
court
is
completely
responsible
for
and
mandate
and
the
constitution
mandates
it
or
make
to
exercise
supervisory
and
administrative
authority
over
all
the
courts
of
pennsylvania.
the
constitution
is
quite
specific
in
listing
almost
everything
at
least
that
i
as
the
draftsman
of
that
provision
could
think
of
that
courts
do.
so
that
the
supreme
court
would
become
as
indeed
of
this
--
the
administrator
of
the
courts
of
pennsylvania
under
the
constitution
that
appoints
an
administrator
and
has
done
so
and
a
distinguished
former
justice
of
our
supreme
court
who
sits
in
this
room.
but,
if
the
appearance
of
the
supreme
court
in
this
court
is
unique,
even
more
unique
is
the
action
of
the
district
court
in
this
case,
and
i
think
i
am
safe
at
least
to
the
extent
that
the
research
of
my
associates
and
i
go
in
saying
that
there
is
no
case
in
which
a
lower
court
has
conceded
that
there
is
no
constitutional
mandate
upon
it
to
call
upon
to
command
the
state
courts
to
take
action
and
nevertheless
did
so,
and
did
so
in
a
drastic
and
completely
absorbing
manner.
the
case
proceeded
through
its
entire
trial,
through
the
entire
argument
without
so
much
as
of
unmentioned
of
the
use
of
the
courts,
and
even
when
it
first
appeared
in
our
brief,
we
said
that
it
first
appeared
in
the
proposed
order
of
the
plaintiffs
that
is
not
correct
but
appeared
shortly
before
that
as
a
footnote
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
without
any
comment
by
the
court.
the
court
just
blindly
said,
until
the
legislature
acts,
we
command,
then
used
those
words
until
a
legislature
acts,
the
state
court
system
shall
carry
on.
they
used
the
words
initially
and
till
it
creates
an
unbiased
tribunal.
in
the
final
order
it
says,
until
the
state
legislature
creates
an
alternate
neutral
tribunal
and
indeed
my
friend
in
his
complaint
simply
asked
for
a
disinterested
and
impartial
decision
maker.
and
then
comes
this
footnote,
then
comes
the
order
as
a
complete
surprise
to
anyone.
there
is
this
mandate
to
the
courts
and
there
is
no
mandate
to
the
legislature
indeed.
if
there
would
have
been
an
incentive
on
the
legislature
to
act.
for
example
they
had
followed
the
accustomed
procedure
assuming
their
right
substantively
of
simply
saying
this
is
the
mandate
to
the
commonwealth
and
unless
the
commonwealth
acts,
then
all
these
people
would
be
released.
the
public
clamor
would
have
made
the
legislature
act.
today,
there
can
not
be
any
clamor,
the
district
court
in
its
wisdom
has
said
that
this
shall
be
saddled
upon
the
state
court
system.
now,
it
has
been
said
that
--
may
i
ask
your
honors
after
my
friend
finished,
he
was
asked
questions
by
the
court.
i
had
thought
i
had
ten
minutes
in
my
debate.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
thank
you
sir.
because
i
really
think
it
is
a
very
important
matter
to
the
court.
the
defendants,
the
attorney
general
in
his
exceptions
to
that
order
made
clear
to
the
court
his
contention
that
this
was
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
now,
this
court
has
said
so
in
many
opinions.
i
refer
primarily
to
younger
against
harris,
where
this
court
really
pulled
together
the
philosophy,
pointed
out
that
comity
demands
that
the
federal
government
would
never
interfere
with
state
court
systems
unless
under
constitutional
mandate
and
even
then,
with
a
greatest
of
reluctance.
now,
i
just
quote
one
sentence,
the
most
important
the
notion
of
comity,
that
is
a
proper
respect
for
state
functions
and
then
the
court
later
says,
and
a
continuance
of
the
belief
that
the
national
government
will
fair
best
if
the
states
and
their
institutions
are
left
free
to
perform
their
separate
functions
in
their
separate
ways.
i
said
to
your
honors
that
this
is
unique,
why?
here
is
a
court
that
concedes
but
there
is
no
constitutional
mandate
that
the
courts
take
this
up.
indeed
it
says
until
a
legislature
creates
a
neutral
administrative
tribunal
and
nevertheless
it
mandates
the
courts.
i
may
say
mandates
them
in
such
a
way
that
if
the
courts
take
up
this
task,
they
can
do
nothing
else,
for
months
ahead
as
the
telegram
from
the
chief
justice
of
pennsylvania
to
this
court
specifically
said
in
describing
the
overwhelming
and
disrupting
of
the
judicial
system
of
pennsylvania
as
he
described
it,
which
this
would
call
us.
nevertheless,
drastic
as
it
is
on
the
courts
of
pennsylvania,
i
suggest
to
your
honors,
that
it
is
a
more
drastic
deviation,
a
more
drastic
disregard
of
the
mandates
of
this
court,
of
the
preachings
of
this
court
almost
from
its
very
beginnings
at
least
from
chief
justice
marshall
up
to
this
court
which
has
on
three
different
occasions
made
clear
that
there
will
be
no
change
in
that
rule.
now,
i
might
say
to
your
honors
that
there
is
a
very
serious
question,
whether
forgetting
the
interest
of
the
court
system
of
pennsylvania,
the
district
court
did
not
disregard
the
interest
of
the
people
whom
it
really
intended
to
help.
whether
the
order
would
not
create
more
harm
than
help
for
these
youngsters.
i
may
say
i
happen
to
agree
with
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
the
talk
about
13
and
14
year
olds
does
not
represent
the
1
and
2
year
old
anymore
than
a
14
year
old
child
is
represented
by
a
16
year
old
child
that
the
question
is
can
you
drive
when
you
can
drive
at
16,
or
an
18
year
old
child
who
can
vote
represents
a
14
year
old
child
who
can
not
vote
and
so
on,
in
states
where
18
has
become
the
voting
age.
now,
my
view
is
supported,
and
i
believe
this
from
the
beginning
when
we
got
the
brief
of
the
most
distinguished
people
in
america
on
the
subject.
the
american
psychiatric
association,
the
american
society
for
adolescent
psychiatry,
the
american
academy
of
child
psychiatry,
the
american
association
of
psychiatric
services
for
children,
all
have
said
that
this
kind
of
adversary
proceeding
far
from
providing
the
ideal
forum
for
such
determination
has
a
very
great
potential
for
harm
to
many
individuals,
particularly
the
younger
individuals.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no
there
is
nothing
said
about
that.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes.
now,
there
is
a
waiver
of
some
provisions
permitted
provided
that
counsel
joins
in
it
but
he
must
first
get
counsel
and
these
experts
say
your
honors
that
an
administrative
model
for
tribunal
that
reviews
such
matters
maybe
the
most
effective
and
it
happens,
the
american
psychiatric
association
suggests
a
psychiatrist,
a
lawyer
and
another
mental
health
professional.
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
has
filed
an
amicus
in
which
she
takes
the
same
position
and
suggests
an
independent
board
of
psychiatrist
or
other
professionals.
but,
i
submit
to
your
honors
and
i
do
not
draw
on
my
own
experience
which
in
this
field
has
been
rather
considerable
with
institutions,
that
i
do
not
think
you
can
find
an
honest
disagreement
on
the
part
of
the
profession,
or
at
least
the
group
of
people
in
the
profession.
now,
your
honors,
there
are
some
points
made
by
the
defendants
i
believe,
they
are
answered
but
we
did
not
seek
to
become
a
party,
it
seems
to
me
crystal
clear
that
i
see
the
white
light
is
on,
but
i
have
two
minutes
according
to
my
stopwatch.
and
i
think
your
lights
are
out
of
guilt
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
first,
they
argue
that
the
supreme
court
did
not
ask
to
be
a
party.
well,
for
heaven's
sake,
why
would
they
ask
to
be
a
party
when
the
plaintiff
in
its
complaint
asked
for
an
administrative
tribunal
when
the
court
never
so
much
has
mentioned
to
district
court
that
the
courts
would
be
involved
until
the
opinion
came
down.
when
the
opinion
came
down,
nothing
happened,
until
three
months
later.
there
was
communication,
almost
three
months,
with
the
administrator's
office.
second,
they
say
that
the
court
never
really
had
a
chance
to
rule
on
this
question.
now
that's
not
correct
of
course,
because
as
i
said
the
defendant's
exception
specifically
raised
it
and
finally
they
take
the
wholly
unwarranted
position
and
i
quote,
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
indicated
that
it
would
provide
the
hearings
contemplated
in
the
proposed
order.
what
actually
happened
is
a
legal
assistant
in
the
administrator's
office
wrote
a
letter
in
which
he
said
in
which
he
said
the
courts
would
cooperate
and
provide
for
special
masters.
well,
it
so
happens
first
of
all,
that
special
masters
would
be
invalid
under
the
constitution
of
pennsylvania,
if
they
were
given
decisional
authority
and
second,
when
it
came
to
the
supreme
court,
they
just
dismissed
that
out
of
hand
and
when
you
put
in
that
special
masters,
the
administrator
had
a
commitment
from
judge
hewitt,
that
judge
hewitt
would
call
him
and
would
discuss
these
matters
with
him.
instead
of
that
judge
hewitt
called
him
one
day
and
said
“my
order
is
being
entered
today,
i
am
sorry
but
i
have
got
to
enter
it
so
that
people
can
appeal
and
i
am
sending
you
my
order”,
and
the
administrator
wrote
to
him
saying,
“in
view
of
that,
we
simply
can't
handle
it
in
the
court
of
pennsylvania”
that
is
the
whole
story,
your
honors.
i
suggest
that
the
district
court
acted
without
precedent.
it
acted
unwisely,
it
acted
unnecessarily.
its
own
opinion
shows
that
administrative
tribunal
would
have
done.
if
i
were
the
judge,
what
i
would
simply
have
said
is,
assuming
i
was
correct
in
a
substance,
that
it
is
up
to
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
to
provide
the
hearings
and
if
it
does
not,
i
would
give
what
the
results
would
have
been.
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
at
least
in
this
respect,
the
order
must
be
reversed.
thank
you.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
do
not
think
it
was,
i
mean.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
it
happens
i
think
it
is
wrong
but
i
am
not
arguing
that
point
but
i
said
if
it
were
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
i
would
hesitate
to
talk
about
that.
i
could
only
give
my
position
because
it
is
a
court
and
it
may
come
up
do
it
in
some
other
form.
my
own
position
mr.
justice
white
is
very
clear
that
the.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
thank
you.
