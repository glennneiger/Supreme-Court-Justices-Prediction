justice
john
paul
stevens
you
contend
that
the
issue
is
here
any
different
with
respect
to
a
private
placement
as
opposed
to
a
public
placement,
that
is
the
nature
of
the
institution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
any
respect?
are
they
issues
the
same
if
the
child
has
placed
in
deveraux
as
if
he
is
placed
in
a
state
hospital?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
watkins
before
you
sit
down,
you
started
by
saying
they
were
two
issues
you
were
going
to
talk
about;
one
was
whether
there
was
an
impact
on
liberty
as
i
understand
it,
i
never
did
understand
what
the
second
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
this
the
proper
procedure
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
again
it
is
decided
until
the
legislatures
acts.
paragraph
11
of
the
order
says
that
you
got
to
use
state
board
system.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
two
questions
before
you
sit
down.
first,
would
you
comment
briefly
on
the
argument
that
imposing
the
attorney
requirement
particularly
in
the
private
sector
adds
a
significant
element
of
the
cost
and
the
whole
business
is
so
expensive
already
that
may
actually
deter
the
number
of
children
who
need
care,
who
will
actually
be
placed.
and
secondly
would
you
comment
on
the
suggestion
that
the
proper
disposition
now
is
to
remand
for
consideration
in
the
light
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
not
talking
only
about
the
cost
in
the
public
facilities
but
the
private
as
well.
do
those
figures
relate
to
that
or
that's
really
probably
not
as
far
as
the
records
is
concered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
since
one
of
the
arguments
was
that
this
inevitably
the
private
placements
would
be
governed
by
this
and
the
cost
of
the
private
placement
will
be
affected
by
the
need
to
hire
the
counsel
and
everything.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
the
parents
are
not
indigent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ferleger,
you
haven't
had
a
chance
to
answer
my
second
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
is
what
is
your
reaction
to
the
suggestion
in
a
view
the
new
statute
would
be
a
remand
statute?
