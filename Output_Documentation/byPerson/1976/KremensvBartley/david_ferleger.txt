mr.
david
ferleger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
general
issue
in
this
case
of
whether
the
state
may
upon
parental
application
institutionalize
involuntarily
and
indeterminably
juveniles
in
mental
institution
is
a
very
great
one
and
i
think
if
the
importance
and
implications
of
any
rule
in
this
matter
demand
that
the
court
be
aware
of
what
is
not
before
it
and
how
narrow
the
issues
in
this
case
actually
are.
this
case
does
not
involve
the
issue
of
whether
private
facilities
which
are
truly
private,
even
if
the
mental
health
facilities
must
have
hearings
before
a
child
is
committed.
pennsylvania
law
cited
at
page
five
with
the
one
of
my
opinion
makes
it
clear
that
on
your
pennsylvania
law
of
private
facilities
are
required
to
use
the
provisions
of
the
statutes
that
are
involved
here.
this
case
is
unlike
the
jackson
versus
metropolitan,
the
electric
case
where
all
you
had
was
a
general
state
regulation
and
no
action
by
the
state
regarding
requirements
or
hearings
before
electricity
terminations.
this
case
does
also
not
involve
the
standard
of
commitment
where
they
have
to
be
dangerous,
severely,
mentally
ill
to
be
committed.
the
court
made
that
very
clear
in
footnote
4
of
its
opinion.
the
case
does
not
involve
the
self
incrimination
issue,
kind
of
potential
mental
patient
be
forced
to
testify
against
him
or
herself.
mr.
david
ferleger
yes.
mr.
david
ferleger
with
regard
to
pennsylvania
as
well,
i
do
agree
that
private
facilities
in
pennsylvania
are
acting
under
color
of
state
law.
there
are
others
so.
mr.
david
ferleger
that
is
correct.
there
are
other
states,
however,
in
which
private
institutions
function
just
as
any
mental
hospital,
or
any
general
hospital
that
is
public,
that's
private.
so
that
in
some
states,
private
institutions
in
affirmance,
in
this
case
would
not
affect
those
states
at
all.
mr.
david
ferleger
that
is
correct.
your
honor,
the
facilities
that
are
covered
by
the
pennsylvania
mental
health
statute,
the
word
facility
itself
is
defined
in
the
act
as
including
private
as
well
as
public
facilities.
no
person
can
enter
any
hospital,
mental
hospital
in
pennsylvania
except
under
the
statutes
that
are
challenged
in
this
case.
mr.
david
ferleger
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
ferleger
justice
stewart,
i
would
agree
i
think
that
both
are
alternative
grounds
that
end
up
with
the
same
result.
mr.
david
ferleger
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
ferleger
yes.
another
issue
that
i
submit
is
not
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
a
judicial
hearing
as
opposed
to
administrative
hearing
is
required.
the
lower
court
contrary
to
mr.
segal's
suggestion,
never
reached
that
issue.
the
complaint
which
was
filed
four
years
ago,
before
the
blossoming
of
mental
health
cases
in
the
lower
courts,
did
not
request
the
judicial
hearing
and
the
entire
issue
which
is
in
part
an
equal
protection
issue
of
whether
a
judicial
hearing
is
required
as
opposed
to
administrative
hearing
was
not
specifically
decided
by
the
lower
court.
another
issue
that
is
not
--
mr.
david
ferleger
that
is
correct
but
that
result
mr.
justice
stevenson
and
it
was
discussed
in
the
early
argument,
is
one
that
was
inevitable
by
the
declaratory
judgment
that
the
lower
court
entered.
once
the
declaratory
judgment
is
entered,
the
children
could
not
be
placed
upon
parental
application.
the
only
way
that
a
child
could
get
into
a
mental
hospital
involuntarily
except
an
emergency,
would
be
through
a
court
action.
the
state
courts
through
the
declaratory
judgment
would
have
been
holding
all
these
hearings
for
new
commitments
in
any
case.
there
was
no
additional
burden
that
was
placed
upon
the
state
courts,
once
the
declaratory
judgment
entered
and
parents
could
no
longer
apply
and
have
the
state
accept
their
children.
the
state
courts
would
have
been
holding
all
these
hearings
for
children
in
any
case
and
on
the
pennsylvania
law,
children
would
have
no
less.
mr.
david
ferleger
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
ferleger
there
could
not
have
been
a
hearing
scheme
in
my
opinion
without
legislation.
mr.
david
ferleger
that
would
satisfy
the
opinion
in
this
case.
mr.
david
ferleger
in
my
opinion
not
because
with
the
declaratory
judgment,
the
only
provisions
left
for
admission
to
mental
hospitals
where
those
under
the
statute
and
regulations
and
the
pennsylvania
laws
was
clear
that
otherwise
any
mental
facility
could
not
admit
anyone.
mr.
david
ferleger
excuse
me.
mr.
david
ferleger
that
is
correct
but
that
issue
is
not
presented
by
the
briefs
or
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
state
courts
could
certainly
appoint
the
masters
or
referees
to
hold
hearings.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
pennsylvania
under
section
406,
the
court
committed
a
law
of
section
of
this
act.
in
1971
after
dickson
versus
attorney
general,
that's
pennsylvania
mental
health
decision,
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
promulgated
a
specific
rule
allowing
common
pleas
courts,
trial
courts
in
pennsylvania,
to
appoint
masters
to
hold
mental
health
hearings.
when
dickson
declared
physician
certification
commitment
provision
unconstitutional,
there
were
14,000
people
in
pennsylvania
mental
hospitals
who
needed
hearings
and
who
had
to
get
reprocessed.
in
this
case
there
are
about
8,000
or
9,000
presently
committed
children
who
need
hearings.
mr.
david
ferleger
no,
your
honor,
i
wanted
to
reply
to
that
and
to
the
question
you
ask
mr.
segal
about
presence
of
person.
the
lower
court
is
very
clear
in
its
opinion,
and
repeats
a
number
of
times
that
they
do
not
expect
a
full
hearing
to
take
place
every
time
a
child
was
committed.
the
lower
court
is
very
clear
that
the
only
things
that
cannot
be
waived
are
notice
and
counsel,
however,
a
hearing
can
we
waived,
right
across
examine
can
be
waived,
the
presence
of
person
can
either
be
waived
by
the
child
if
the
child
knows
what
he
or
she
is
doing,
or
the
court
can
say,
and
it
is
mentioned
specifically
in
the
opinion
if
the
child
is
too
ill
to
attend
the
proceedings,
the
children
do
not
have
to
be
taken
to
each
of
these
hearings.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
generally
accepted
law
is,
as
i
understand
the
laws
that
in
criminal
cases
with
exception
of
an
unruly
or
disrupting
--
mr.
david
ferleger
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
ferleger
i
will
explain.
according
to
the
lower
court's
opinion,
the
procedure
for
waiver
is
this.
if
the
court
finds
or
the
unbiased
tribunal
finds
that
the
child
is
competent
to
make
the
waiver
with
counsel
there,
then
the
child
can
make
the
decision,
however,
if
the
court
finds
that
the
child
is
not
able
to
make
the
decision,
the
counsel
that
has
been
appointed
by
the
court
is
permitted
to
make
the
waiver.
mr.
david
ferleger
it
could
in
some--
mr.
david
ferleger
it
could
in
some
cases.
mr.
david
ferleger
but
those
questions
are
present
mr.
chief
justice,
when
an
adult
is
committed,
when
a
35
year
old
severely
retarded
person
is
committed,
when
a
husband
attempts
to
commit
a
wife,
those
questions
of
competency
to
waive
counsel
or
waive
other
procedure
protections
are
all
present
and
do
not--
mr.
david
ferleger
i
believe
that
the
record
indicates
very
strongly
otherwise,
and
the
briefs
of
the
american
orthopsychiatric
association
and
american
psychological
association,
i
think,
mostly
indicate
otherwise.
the
experience
in
this
kind
of
process--
mr.
david
ferleger
no,
what
i
mean
is
that
the--
mr.
david
ferleger
what
i
mean
is
that
the
trauma
is
no
greater
than
that
on
anyone
who
goes
through
a
mental
commitment
process,
and
what
i
mean
is
that
whatever
trauma
there
is,
the
trauma
is
less
than
being
placed
indeterminately
in
a
mental
institution
with
no
process
at
all.
mr.
david
ferleger
at
this
point,
mr
justice
powell,
and
i
was
about
to
get
to
that,
i
am
not
to
decide
--
i
do
not
believe
that
that
question
is
before
this
court.
the
appellants
in
their
brief
did
not
discuss
at
all
whether
each
and
everyone
of
the
requirements
that
the
lower
court
required
are
in
their
views
proper.
the
lower
court's
decision
on
whether
parents
have
that
power
to
make
their
kids
without
a
hearing.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
central
issue
is
whether
some
kind
of
hearing,
hearing
in
counsel
and
notice,
those
very
basic
requirements
whether
that
is
necessary
before
a
child
can
be
committed.
whether
it's
72
hours,
or
48
hours,
or
two
weeks,
or
a
month,
that
is
not
before
the
court,
whether
the
specifics
of
the
waiver
issue
that
is
not
before
the
court,
all
these
issues
are
not
before
the
court--
mr.
david
ferleger
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
do
not
believe
it
is
for
the
reason
that
i
will
explain.
in
page
8a
in
the
appendix
to
my
brief,
the
letter
that
mr.
segal
referred
to--
mr.
david
ferleger
it
is
a
white
brief.
mr.
david
ferleger
one
of
the
white
briefs
mr.
justice.
mr.
david
ferleger
at
page
8a
at
the
appendix,
is
a
letter
that
mr.
segal
referred
to
as
being
from
an
administrative
system.
this
is
part
of
a
correspondence
between
a
district
court
and
a
state
court
administrator.
there
was
every
attempt
to
be
cooperative
and
you
will
note
that
the
date
of
this
letter
which
begins
at
page
5a
is
october
15th,
a
month
and
two
days
before
the
final
order
was
entered.
and
at
page
8a,
the
court
administrator
told
the
three-judge
federal
court,
we
are
where
that
perhaps
5,000
hearings
or
more
may
have
to
be
conducted
within
the
next
several
months,
and
are
preparing
to
shoulder
that
hearing
responsibility
with
full
cooperation
from
your
honorable
court,
on
page
10a,
the
federal
court
responded,
and
in
the
third
paragraph
said,
i
know
that
you
said
in
your
letter,
you
are
preparing
to
implement
our
opinion.
now,
the
order
in
that
paragraph
that
you
refered
to
mr.
justice
brennan
was
entered
with
no
intervening
communication
from
the
pennsylvania
courts.
pennsylvania
courts
had
told
he
federal
court--
mr.
david
ferleger
that
is
what.
at
that
correspondence,
we
are
preparing
to
implement
your
opinion,
and
the
order
was
entered
and
then
after
the
order
was
entered,
the
objections
came
in
a
letter
that
was
used
later.
mr.
david
ferleger
we
are
asking
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
across
the
board
with
the
caveat
that
the
court
is
not
deciding
the
very
detailed
specifics
of
due
process.
i
think
that
this
court
can
say
that
the
due
process--
mr.
david
ferleger
i
think
the
reason
is
that
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
the
issue
raised
by
the
appellants
in
this
case
was
not
whether
all
those
specifics
apply,
but
whether
the
parents-state-child
relationship
allows
a
commitment
without
any
kind
of
hearing
at
all.
mr.
david
ferleger
right
that,
that--
mr.
david
ferleger
i
think
that
if
you
--
an
examination
of
the
arguments
that
are
made
with
regard
to
that
question
are
not
with
regard
to
the
specifics,
but
with
regard
to
the
preiser
v.
rodriguez
issue.
that
question
did
not
involve--
mr.
david
ferleger
not,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
issue
that
is
presented
by
that
question
with
regard
to
the
retro-activity
is
only
in
my
reading
of
it
with
regard
to
the
preiser
v.
rodriguez
issue
and
the
retro-activity
issue.
mr.
david
ferleger
yes.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
first
question
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
david
ferleger
that
is
right.
mr.
david
ferleger
yes
but
i
think
it
is
not
necessary,
maybe
this
will
clarify
it
to
go
further
than
saying
that
a
juvenile
is
entitled
to
some
kind
of
hearing,
and
not
i
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
to
go
into
everything
that
the
hearing
involvsd.
mr.
david
ferleger
well,
one
alternative
would
be
to
simply
--
i
think
that
this
court
can
state
that
the
district
court's
requirements
are
a
hearing
that
would
be
permissible
under
the
constitution
without
deciding
whether
or
not
the
hourly
requirements
and
the
days
and
the
presence
--.
mr.
david
ferleger
well,
our
position
is
of
course
those
are
mandated
by
the
constitution
in
my
--
what
i
was--
mr.
david
ferleger
i
am
not
certain
of
that.
i
think
that
the
court
can
make
it
clear
that
as
in
jackson
versus
indiana,
where
the
court
said
that
you
cannot
commit
the
deaf-mute
retarded
person
for
some
indeterminant
term
until
he
becomes
competent.
the
court
specifically
said
that
no
specific
time
requirements
would
be
imposed.
mr.
david
ferleger
i
see
that
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
david
ferleger
no
i
don't,
i
don't
really
--
mr.
david
ferleger
the
authority
in
the
paragraph
mr.
justice
brennan
referred
to
just
say
that
the
courts
should
hold
the
hearings
into
legislature
acts.
i
don't
think
that
that
issue
is
before
the
court,
if
the
issue
--
mr.
david
ferleger
yes.
mr.
david
ferleger
yes,
the
judgement
is
here.
mr.
david
ferleger
but
that
was
an
issue
not
decided
by
the
lower
court
because
the
lower
court
at
the
time
that
that
provision
was
entered
understood
that
the
state
courts
were
going
to
hold
the
hearings.
and
there
was
no
issue
or
controversy
about
that.
mr.
david
ferleger
that's
not
in
the
opinion.
mr.
david
ferleger
i
think
that
the
court
could
strike
down
or
at
least
vacate
for
reconsideration,
certain
parts
of
this
argument.
mr.
david
ferleger
i
think,
that
the
question
with
regard
to
the
commitment
issue
that
procedures
of
commitment,
the
question
raised
by
the
jurisdictional
statement
is
whether
parents
can
give
up
children's
rights
and
in
this
case,
what
we
are
asking
for
is
what
this
court
is
upheld
in
mental
health
cases,
since
1917
and
what
every
court
has
upheld
that
has
considered
it,
which
is
the
basic
right
to
a
chance
to
tell
your
side
of
the
story
before
you
are
put
into
a
mental
hospital.
and
it's
our
position
that
the
rights
that
the
state
grants
parents
to
apply
for
institutionalization
and
it's
always
the
state
facility
that
makes
the
decision
about
institutionalization.
the
parents
cannot
put
any
child
into
an
institution,
unless
the
facility
says
they
will
accept
the
child,
those
rights
cannot
be
upheld
where
the
child
is
incarcerated
for
an
indeterminant
time
in
a
situation
which
is
potentially
very
dangerous
and
where
there
is
great
stigma
and
effect,
address
effect
on
the
child.
that
involuntary,
indeterminant
kind
of
institutionalization,
we
feel
brings
this
case
within
the
gault
line
of
cases
as
well
as
the
mental
health
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
and
we
feel
further
that
parents
cannot
be
granted
the
absolute
right
to
make
that
decision
as
a
in
the
danport's
case,
we
submit
that
the
rights
of
the
parents
whatever
those
constitutional
right
might
be
cannot
be
such
as
to
deprive
the
child
of
liberty
in
that
kind
of
way.
those
parental
rights
or
whatever
that
maybe,
do
not
outway
the
child's
right
to
counsel
and
a
chance
to
tell
his
or
her
side
of
the
story.
mr.
david
ferleger
as
one
of
our
expert
witnesses
mr.
justice,
even
said
that,
he
has
never
seen
that
having
an
attorney
or
a
hearing
adds
to
the
stigma.
what
it
stigmatized
he
said,
is
the
fact
of
being
a
mental
patient,
the
fact
of
being
in
a
hospital.
there
is
because
of
the
admissions
process,
a
declaration
they
give
mentally
disabled,
whether
you
go
in
by
your
parents
or
whether
you
go
in
through
the
court,
the
hospital
still
has
to
agree
you
are
in
need
of
mental
care
in
order
to
accept
it.
so
we
feel
that
the
stigma
is
the
same,
the
effects
as
many
ex-patients
know
are
the
same
as
well.
mr.
david
ferleger
yes
the
opinion
of
the
experts
was
that
in
fact
as
the
court
noted
in
gault,
the
trauma,
excuse
me,
the
hearing
process
can
be
very
therapeutic
to
whatever
extent
it
is
traumatic,
it
is
no
more
traumatic
than
it
is
for
adults
who
have
the
hearing
and
whatever
trauma
there
is,
it
is
insignificant
compared
to
the
trauma
of
being
locked
up
in
a
hospital
with
no
chance
to
have
some
fair
procedure
to
determine
that.
mr.
david
ferleger
i
think
that
an
independent
tribunal
of
some
sort,
and
it
is
my
own
personal
opinion,
might
be
appropriate
and
might
withstand
constitutional
scrutiny
of
this
court
should
ever
be
faced
with
that
issue.
i
am
not
certain
whether
i
agree
that
the
board
should
be
composed
simply
of
psychiatrists.
the
courts
have
made
it
very
clear
that
a
deprivation
of
liberty
in
the
mental
health
area
is
not
a
medical
decision
and
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
should
be
left
simply
to
the
medical
profession.
mr.
david
ferleger
my
own
feeling
is
that
the
constitution
if
it
was
ever
presented
ought
to
require
and
would
have
required
such
a
hearing,
but
i
have
not
--
mr.
david
ferleger
would,
but
i
am
not
aware
of
any
decision
that
has
faced
that
question,
every
other
mental
health
decision
in
the
country
in
the
federal
court
as
well
as
the
state
courts
requires
a
judicial
hearing,
there
is
the
saville
versus
treadway
case
in
tenesse
which
in
some
cases
allows
an
administrative
process
followed
i
think
by
appeal
to
a
court
of
judge
gibbons,
one
of
the
members
of
the
panel
in
one
hearing
in
this
case
raised
this
a
possibility
tribunal
that
was
administrative
followed
by
court
of
appeal.
mr.
david
ferleger
i
think
that
the
courts
have
the
power
to
specify
some
limits
to
the
powers
of
the
states
in
this
regard,
i
think
that,
the
federal
courts
can
say,
i
am
here
with
some
extreme
range,
of
course,
can
say
that
one
year
in
a
mental
hospital
without
a
hearing
is
not
proper,
i
think
the
court's
--
mr.
david
ferleger
that's
what
i
meant.
and
in
order
to
set
up
the
limits
of
the
due
process
rights,
i
think
the
courts
can
order
counsel,
i
think
the
court's
can
order
certain
kinds
of
notice,
i
think
the
courts
can
adopt
for
example
a
72
hour
provision
in
this
case
as
consistent
with
the
american
bar
associations
provisions,
is
consistent
with
the
juvenile
court
laws
in
pennsylvania,
it's
consistent
--
mr.
david
ferleger
no,
they
are
not.
mr.
david
ferleger
that's
correct.
mr.
david
ferleger
yes,
the
two
things
--
mr.
david
ferleger
yes,
a
notice
and
a
hearing
and
i
think
that
those
are
the
issues
that
this
court
should
reach
and
maybe
that
as
in
gerstein
versus
pew
this
court
may
choose
to
say
that
the
very
detailed
specifics
either
were
not
properly
considered
or
should
be
left
to
the
states
to
experiment
in
the
wisdom
of
the
states.
and
simply
require
the
probable
cause
along
the
hearing
counsel.
mr.
david
ferleger
not
at
all.
mr.
david
ferleger
certainly
not
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
ferleger
certainly
mr.
justice
steven.
the
final
pre-hearing
order
in
this
case
contains
tables
regarding
the
number
of
people
committed
to
hospitals,
the
pages
are
a
little
obscure
but
314-316
of
the
appendix
indicates
that
the
numbers
of
people
committed
each
year
to
state
institutions
which
are
those
that
are
listed
here,
are
not
all
the
great
on
a
yearly
basis.
the
number
of
people
now
in
hospitals
is
very
large
but
the
number
of
people
who
come
in
is
not
so
great
in
my
opinion
that
the
cost
of
providing
counsel
or
hearing
provides
too
great
administrative
burden.
mr.
david
ferleger
those
figures
don't
discuss
the
number
of
people
that
came
in
in
to
the
private
facilities.
mr.
david
ferleger
it
will
be
a
public
cost
to
counsel
for
the
child.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
court
did
not
address
that
issue.
pennsylvania
--
mr.
david
ferleger
well,
not
necessarily
true,
for
this
reason.
it
is
not
clear
that
the
law
would
require
that
parents
pay
for
counsel
for
a
child
in
any
of
these
cases,
either
--
mr.
david
ferleger
they
do
but
the
question
about
whether
a
counsel
for
a
child
in
a
possibly
adverse
situation
should
be
paid
by
the
parents
is
not
clear
at
all.
mr.
david
ferleger
correct.
mr.
david
ferleger
that's
correct.
in
pennsylvania
and
i
believe,
although
i
am
not
certain
now
their
the
legal
service
--
mr.
david
ferleger
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
expressed
at
all
in
pennsylvania
law.
also,
pennsylvania
law
specifically
states
that
people
in
commitment
proceedings
shall
be
represented
by
public
defenders
without
specifying
child
or
adult
and
without
defining
the
standards
for
--
mr.
david
ferleger
yes.
mr.
david
ferleger
not
when
the
due
process
involves
procedures
that
go
to
the
very
essence
of
the
fact
finding
procedure.
this
court
has
required
when
facts
need
to
be
found
as
they
do
in
a
mental
health
area,
that
some
due
process
needs
to
be
required.
i
do
not
see
that
a
procedure
that
assures
that
people
are
not
erroneously
committed
or
committed
when
they
could
be
in
community
care,
i
don't
see
that
that
procedure
can
harm
someone
in
the
way
that
an
overdose
of
insulin
shot.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
court
--
i
will
answer
your
question
and
then
conclude.
the
court
discussed
in
the
opinion,
a
number
of
cases
where
children
were
committed
for
simply
running
away
from
home,
for
colitis,
or
weight
loss,
or
all
kinds
of
physical
problems
and
where
children
were
commitment
for
stealing,
for
setting
fires,
those
kinds
of
things
which
require
a
fact
finding
process.
mr.
david
ferleger
no,
no.
mr.
david
ferleger
they
were
findings
on
evidence
that
was
submitted
in
response
to
interrogatories
regarding
the
reasons
of
commitment
of
particular
individuals.
those
reasons
as
stated
by
the
hospitals
themselves.
the
issue
of
did
this
child
run
away,
did
this
child
set
the
fire,
did
this
child
act
in
a
crazy
way
that
he
is
accused
of,
is
this
retarded
person
going
to
benefit
for
being
in
an
institution?
those
are
questions
that
need
some
forum
to
the
side
--
mr.
david
ferleger
the
named
plaintiffs,
their
facts
are
discussed
in
a
brief.
one
of
the
named
plaintiffs
parents
are
divorced,
her
father
in
florida,
her
mother
in
pennsylvania,
which
is
with
her
father,
she
does
fine,
never
in
a
mental
hospital,
never
any
behavioral
problems.
when
she
is
with
her
mother,
she
gets
in
to
fight
with
her
mother
and
gets
admitted
s
in
to
a
hospital.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
district
court
did
not
discuss
whether
that
should
happen
or
not.
the
district
court
did
noticed
that
those
were
facts
should
have
been
presented
in
some
kind
od
hearing
for.
mr.
david
ferleger
i
have
realized
that.
you
repeat
the
question
–
i
have
had
trouble
with
remembering
--
mr.
david
ferleger
i
don't
believe
that
the
new
statute
is
before
this
court
at
all.
the
only
statute
that
is
before
the
court
is
the
mental
health,
the
mental
retardation
act
of
1966,
the
majority
of
the
substantial
portion
of
the
class
that
is
still
in
mental
hospitals
as
of
today
are
covered
under
that
statute.
the
new
statute
is
not
at
all
before
this
court.
this
is
unlike
fusari
versus
steinberg
where
there
were
major
issues
in
the
law
that
affected
the
entire
class.
i
don't
think
this
court
needs
to
the
decide
or
discuss
in
anyway,
the
new
statute
because
the
members
of
the
class
whom
i
represent
are
before
the
court
only
with
regard
to
the
statute,
with
regard
to
which
we
bothered
the
complaint.
thank
you.
