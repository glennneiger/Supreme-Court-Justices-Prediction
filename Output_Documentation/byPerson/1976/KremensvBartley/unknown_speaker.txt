unknown
speaker
because
now
you
have
it
in
statute?
unknown
speaker
the
rest
being
mentally
retarded.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
not
there
a
question,
mr.
watkins,
before
you
get
to
the
question
what
kind
of
a
hearing
you
have,
or
as
to
whether
there
is
any
state
action
here
–
the
stilt
is
depriving
anybody
of
liberty?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
that
clear,
what
happens
if
a
child
runs
away
from
one
of
these
institutions?
certainly
they
do
not
issue
a
bench-warrant.
unknown
speaker
is
there
some
in
the
record
about
this?
unknown
speaker
would
it
stand
any
different
from
what
it
would
be
if
the
parents
reported
missing
a
child
and
the
police
follow
their
procedures
and
pick
the
person
up
and
return
him
to
the
family.
is
that
about
what
is
done
with
the
institutional
--
unknown
speaker
what
does
that
mean?
i
mean
deveraux
as
what?
so
many
physicians,
so
many
nurses,
such
physical
facilities?
unknown
speaker
precisely
as
a
public
institution?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
ferleger,
let
me
just
interrupt
a
second.
did
you
say
it
does
not
involve
the
private
placement
question
but
if
as
you
say
they
are
required
by
state
law
to
follow
the
procedure
which
you
say
is
inadequate.
would
they
not
be
acting
under
color
of
state
law
and
accepting
a
challenge?
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
are
we
not
necessarily,
if
we
decided
one
way
or
the
other
necessarily
deciding
the
private
question
as
well?
unknown
speaker
we
are
already
deciding
that
question
in
pennsylvania
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
you
agree
that
they
are
acting
on
a
color
of
state
law,
actually
you
are
contend
that
they
are
acting
under
color
of
state
law,
don't
you?
when
you
wanted
them
embraced
in
the
decree.
unknown
speaker
and
you
contend
that
makes
the
action
of
the
private
facilities
when
they
follow
the
state
law,
state
actions.
unknown
speaker
the
legislature
might
provide
a
different
hearings
scheme.
unknown
speaker
or
could
there
be
a
hearing
scheme
in
just
without
the
legislation
outside
the
court.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
a
mental
health
facility
in
pennsylvania
could
not
itself
in
responding
to
a
judgment
of
a
district
court
institute
an
administrative
hearing
on
its
own,
that
would
satisfy
due
process.
unknown
speaker
yes,
except
for
the
paragraph
that,
except
for
the
order
that
you
are
holding
in
the
courts.
unknown
speaker
no,
the
idea
that
anything
can
be
waived
is
certainly
nothing
that
this
district
court
judge
had
to
say,
that
is
just
a
generally
accepted
laws,
is
not
it?
unknown
speaker
as
long
as
knowing
and
expressed,
you
can
waive
anything.
unknown
speaker
it
is
that
not
before
us,
what
you
perceive
to
be
the
central
issue?
unknown
speaker
after
this
correspondence?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
said
several
things
are
not
before
us
in
response
to
questions
from
my
brothers
brennan
and
powell,
yet
you
are
asking
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
across
the
board,
are
you
not?
unknown
speaker
that
is
all.
unknown
speaker
and
how
can
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
which
contains
details
specifics
of
due
process
without
deciding
that
those
are
required
by
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
what's
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
is
whether
or
not
the
retroactive
injunctive
relief
granted
by
the
lower
court
is
improper?
unknown
speaker
that
is
pretty
gentle,
pretty
general
question.
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
however
far
this
question
might
reach
it
should
be
interpreted
by
reading
the
briefs?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
the
question
is
here
is
whether
or
not
the
pennsylvania
procedures
comport
with
due
process?
do
you
think
that
question
is
here?
unknown
speaker
where?
in
what
question?
unknown
speaker
the
first
question
is
whether
the
parents
may
waive
the
constitutional
rights
of
juveniles.
unknown
speaker
what
if
a
judgment
below
is
attacked
only
on
one
or
two
points,
this
court
has
no
authority
to
vacate
any
other
other
parts
of
the
judgment.
and
we
are
entitled
to
adjudicate
only
the
questions
that
are
raised
here,
aren't'
we?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ferleger,
would
you
address
the
argument
that
one
of
the
briefs
makes
that
the
procedures
that
are
specified
with
great
and
additional
stigma
to
the
institutionalization
that
does
not
now
necessarily
exist
and
to
that
extent
counter
productive?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ferleger,
assuming
we
reach
the
issue,
what
process
is
due,
what
do
you
think
of
the
suggestion
that
an
independent
board
of
psychiatrists
would
be
appropriate
to
make
the
independent
decision
like
you
suggest
is
necessary.
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
insisting
on
a
judicial
decision
maker?
unknown
speaker
did
you
say
would
or
would
not?
unknown
speaker
we
can't
say
it's
not
proper,
they
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
violates
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
but
in
your
regard,
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
is
requiring
an
attorney
in
every
case.
unknown
speaker
as
a
constitutional
request.
unknown
speaker
as
i
say
that
the
court
is
absolutely
required,
non-waivably
that
counsel
be
provided
but
that's
going
to
be
provided
at
the
cost
of
the
parents
unless
they
are
indigent,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
they
would
pay
for
his
meals
at
least,
that
is
the
matter
of
state
law.
unknown
speaker
that's
a
(inaudible)
–
there
may
be
an
adversary
relationship
between
child
and
parent
as
to
commitment.
unknown
speaker
not
all
the
child
have
independent
--
unknown
speaker
serves
the
needs
of
the
child
and
this
court
held
that
it
was
a
constitutional
need
of
a
child,
then
i
suppose
as
a
matter
of
state
law
that
the
parents
would
be
required
to
pay
for
the
child's
needs,
would
they,
wouldn't
the
father
or
mother?
unknown
speaker
but
they
are
generally
available,
and
they
are
indigent
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
in
any
of
the
these
occasions
were
they
–
did
the
court
find
that
anybody
has
been
wrongly
committed?
unknown
speaker
every
item
is
erroneous.
unknown
speaker
program
of
what?
