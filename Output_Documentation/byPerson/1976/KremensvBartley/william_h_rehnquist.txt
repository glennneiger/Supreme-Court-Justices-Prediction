justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
intend
to
discuss
the
way
you
now
have
your
argument
plan,
the
question
of
the
class
that
was
before
the
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
what
i
am
interested
in
is
this
and
if
you
don't
intend
or
plan
to
discuss,
just
really
do
not
feel
obliged
to
--
as
i
read
the
district
court's
opinion,
at
no
time
since
the
beginning
of
this
litigation
have
any
of
the
plaintiffs
in
the
action
have
been
less
than
13
years
of
age
and
as
i
read
the
district
court's
opinion,
now
their
pennsylvania
regulations
which
provide
for
treatment
of
13
olds
in
a
much
different
manner
than
those
under
13.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
can
named
plaintiffs
all
of
whom
are
over
13
represent
a
class
which
includes
people
under
13,
if
in
fact
the
law
treats
one
differently
than
the
other.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
was
no
named
individual.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
you
have
state
teachers
presumably
in
a
public
school?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
justice
stewart's
hypothesis
of
sending
a
child
to
a
public
school
you
have
got
state
teachers
or
county
teachers,
they
may
have
recommend
that
the
kid
go
to
that
school,
why
is
that
any
different?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
not
it
necessary
in
answering
that
question
to
decide
what
the
constitutional
rights
of
juveniles
are?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
affirm
the
district
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
district
court
has
no
business
imposing
its
standards
on
the
state
of
pennsylvania
unless
they
were
mandated
by
the
constitution.
it
is
not
just
a
question
of
discretion
or
reasonable
choice.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
would
have
to
so
hold
that
we
affirm
the
judgment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there,
we
were
reversing
a
judgment
that
said
there
were
no
requirements.
that
is
different
than
affirming
a
judgment
which
says
there
are
a
number
of
requirement.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
these
named
plaintiffs?
didn't
you
describing
1:04:28
for
running
away
or
colitis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
district
court
found
that
that
should
not
have
happened?
