now
give
me
a
minute.
well,
you
have
so
many
briefs
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
may
ask
just
you
the
questions
presented
to
a
jurisdictional
state
at
page
nine,
don't
seem
to
be
the
same
questions
presented
in
your
brief
at
page
16.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
all
three
in
the
jurisdictional
statements
are
subsumed
in
the
two
at
page
16
of
your
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
must
say,
i
have
a
little
trouble
reading
in
that
way
but
and
also
as
i
read
your
brief,
you
did
not
attach
your
prospectus
assuming
that
some
hearing
is
necessary.
assuming
that
the
pennsylvania
procedures
do
not
satisfy
due
process.
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
briefs,
in
fact,
individually,
the
prospective
relations.
