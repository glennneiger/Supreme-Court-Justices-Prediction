what
was
wrong
in
saying
that

a
declaratory
judgment
aspect
of
the
case,
was
this
due
process
holding
wrong
or
what?
justice

well,
i
understand
that
but
what
is
your
position,
what
is
the
supreme
court
position
on
the
due
process
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
attack
on
the
injunction,
that
one
should
get
passed
the
declaratory
aspect
of
it,
is
only
with
respect
to
the
retrospective
impact.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
only
point
on
retroactive
is
that
it
violates
eleventh
amendment
or
or
that
it's
powered
by
prieser.
justice
byron
r.

you
don't
say
that
the
court
misread
due
process.
