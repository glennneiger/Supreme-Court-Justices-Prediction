justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
claim,
the
constitutional
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
could
i
find
your
complaint
in
the
records?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
appendix
is
it
right
there
at
page
1,
2
and
3
in
the
appendix?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
third
claim
is
down
in
paragraph
ten
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
the
1983,
you
say,
it
is
just
under
the
constitution?
i
take
if
youâ€¦
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes
and
take
it
that
it
was
understood
to
be
a
1983?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
--
you
stated
both
ways
here,
she
is
either
suing
on
behalf
of
her
son
or
on
her
own
behalf,
either
ways?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
so
which
one
are
you
pushing
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
is
no
question
that
one
of
the
specific
issues
argued
in
colorado
supreme
court
was
whether
or
not
the
1983
action
was
properly
dismissed.
