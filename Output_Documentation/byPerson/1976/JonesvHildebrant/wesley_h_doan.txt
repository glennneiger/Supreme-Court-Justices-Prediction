mr.
wesley
h.
doan
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
that
certainly
is
your
honor,
and
it
was
decided
upon
the
issues
that
whether
or
not,
under
those
circumstances,
the
officer
was
negligent.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
it
goes
along
with
your
question
earlier…
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
it
was
your
honor…
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
well,
i
was
satisfied
with
the
judgment
rendered
by
the
court
and
the
jury
below.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
it
was
your
honor
and
the
instructions
were
submitted
to
the
jury
on
negligence
and
also
as
to
whether
or
not,
in
effect,
it
was
an
excessive
use
of
force
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
and
then…
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
pardon
me.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
no,
i
am
saying
if
the
court
made
a
mistake
it
used
the
word
'merge'
your
honor
or
it
used
the
word
--
i
believe
our
colorado
supreme
court
used
the
word
that
would
be
'engrafted'
upon
the
colorado
wrongful-death
act.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
that
is
correct.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
that
is
correct.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
it
would
have
made
no
difference
at
all
if
your
honor
please
and
the
result
would
have
been
exactly
the
same,
if
every
circuit
case
which
dealt,
most
of
them
dealt
with
survival
that
sided
by
the
appellant
in
this
case
were
applied,
the
result
would
also
be
the
same.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
i
believe
that
it
was
not
validly
pleaded,
that
is
correct.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
because
it
does
not
set
forth
a
claim
for
anything
other
than
the
mother’s
denial
of
what
she
terms
as
her
right
to
raise
her
child
and
that
that
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
what
would
constitute
a
constitutional
claim.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
the
colorado
supreme
court
agreed
with
the
trial
court
that
regardless
of
what
you
called
it
the
net
result
is
going
to
be
the
same
in
effect.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
after
conclusion
of
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
case
it
did
dismiss
what
was
referred
to...
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
yes
it
does
your
honor
and
that
is
the
way
it
is
before
the
court.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
in
answer
to
that
question
if
your
honor
please
it
is
my
belief
that
the
only
thing
that
is
before
this
court
is
our
plea
that
the
damages
in
the
case
are
inadequate.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
i
frankly
do
not
know
how
we
got
here
on
that
issue
because
the
only
issue
claim
as
it
now
comes
back
in
the
reply
brief
is
the
issue
that
the
damages
are
inadequate
and
the
wrong
measure
of
damages
was
used.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
i
still
believe
your
honor
that
that
is
in
fact
a
question
that
he
has
attempted
to
raise
in
this
court
regardless
of
how
he
wishes
to
label
it.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
yes
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
it
was
not…
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
the
1983
action
was
dismissed
because
the
trial
court
says,
“you
have
available
to
you
a
complete
remedy
under
the
colorado
wrongful-death
law.”
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
well,
they
referred
to
it.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
that
is
all
they
said,
that
it
was
engrafted
upon
the
--
because
in
fact,
the
rule
of
damages
in
the
case
would
be
exactly
the
same
by
whatever
name
you
have
called
it,
whether
you
call
it
wrongful-death
or
1983,
you
always
get
to
the
same
rule
of
damages.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
i
cannot
see
how
it
is
your
honor
because
as
i
interpret
the
sum
and
substance
of
the
petition,
the
brief,
the
reply
brief,
the
issue
is
the
damages
were
inadequate,
and
in
effect
saying,
we
did
not
get
enough
because
you
limited
this
to
net
pecuniary
loss.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
yes
i
will
try.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
yeah,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
motion
for
new
trial.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
i
think
that
would
be
construed
as…
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
that
is
correct.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
that
is
not
what
i
interpret
that
they
are
dissenting
from.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
well,
it
could
be
certainly
construed
that
way
your
honor,
but…
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
your
honor,
i
would
submit,
if
your
honor
please,
that
it
does
not.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
well,
that
would
be
of
course,
absolutely
correct,
if
that
were
the
issue
before
the
court
to
correct
this
order.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
well,
i
would
say
that
it
was
argued
mr.
justice
white
because
what
they
were
complaining
about
was
not
in
reality
the
dismissal
of
1983,
because
you
did
not
use
the
right
measure
of
damages
and
ahead
you
said,
it
is
1983
instead
of
wrongful-death,
then
you
should
have
used
punitive
damages,
you
should
have
used
some
federal
rule
and
that
is
what
the
argument
was
all
about.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
no,
i
know
of
no
other
rules
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
could
be
used
in
the
case.
mr.
wesley
h.
doan
no,
because
there
is
no
federal
wrongful-death.
