unknown
speaker
afore
said,
did
the
complaint
mention
1983?
unknown
speaker
well
there
if
you
are
right
there,
we
were
wrong
in
turning
down
gary
gilmore’s
mother’s
petition
for
a
stay?
unknown
speaker
what
he
did
--
his
mother
did
not
think
he
was.
unknown
speaker
do
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rees,
let
me
follow
through
on
justice
white’s
question.
i
think
the
printed
appendix
is
confusing
because
you
print
the
amended
complaint
and
the
answer
to
the
original
complaint
which
is
not
printed
and
the
things
do
not
fit
together.
did
the
original
complaint
cite,
mention
1983
in
so
many
words?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
not
essentially
the
same
certainly.
of
course,
it
is
a
difference
that
is
why
i
am
confused
when
i
read
the
answer
to
the
original
complaint
and
i
am
trying
to
fit
it
under
amended
complaint.
unknown
speaker
i
am
asking,
is
this
1983
mentioned
in
the
original
complaint
and
i
think
that
the
answer
is
no?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
mean.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
the
cuase
why
it
is
not
mentioned
in
the
amended
complaint?
unknown
speaker
is
that
good
pleading?
unknown
speaker
and
how
was
the
1983
as
a
statute
that
allows
civil
recovery
for
the
deprivation
of
any
rights,
privileges,
or
immunities
secured
by
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
and
what
was
the
theory
here?
unknown
speaker
what
provision
the
constitution
or
federal
law…
unknown
speaker
well,
now
you
mean
that
this
person
who
was
killed
should
have
been
given
a
hearing
before
he
was
shot?
is
that
what
you
mean?
unknown
speaker
well,
no
he
should
not
as
a
matter
of
state
authoritative
criminal
law,
but
what
in
the
united
states
constitution
protected
either
him
or
his
mother
from
that?
unknown
speaker
but
what
part
of
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
was
life,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
so,
now
what
was
the
constitutional
violation,
whether
(inaudible)
or
not?
unknown
speaker
and
to
what?
unknown
speaker
but
where
did
you
find
that
in
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
the
due
process
clause,
i
thought
perhaps
you
were
saying
that
there
should
have
been
a
hearing
at
court
before
he
was
shot.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
what
constitutional
deprivation
was
there?
unknown
speaker
first
of
all,
are
you
referring
i
suppose
to
the
fourteenth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
and
now,
what
in
that
fourteenth
amendment?
you
talk
about
equal
protection
in
the
laws
here.
unknown
speaker
equal
protection.
do
you
rely
on
that?
unknown
speaker
because
your
complaint
talked
about
equal
protection,
you
have
abandoned
that,
have
you?
unknown
speaker
he
had
shot
white
people
too?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
case
now
based
upon
the
federal
constitution
or
the
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
that
is
protected
by
state
law,
criminal
and
negligence
law.
unknown
speaker
it
is
still
not
clear
to
me
what
provision
of
the
united
states
constitution
you
are
relying
on?
unknown
speaker
so,
two
different
call,
in
meyer
versus
nebraska
though
the
state
courts
of
nebraska
could
have
held
all
the
hearings
they
wanted
to
in
the
world
and
they
still
would
not
have
been
allowed
to
do
what
they
tried
to
do
in
that
case.
unknown
speaker
if
that
so
then
that
is
a
substantive
type
liberty
as
opposed
to
the
procedural
type
liberty
that
you
are
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
but
you
conceived,
i
do
not
say
you
conceived,
but
do
not
you
agree
that
given
a
suitable
statute
on
the
books
and
a
proper
trial
and
hearing
and
so
forth
that
a
state
could
put
someone
to
death.
unknown
speaker
so,
it
is
not
an
absolute
probation
the
way
it
is
in
meyer?
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
just
turning
1983
into
a
general
tort
statute.
unknown
speaker
whenever
the
defendant
is
a
state
agent?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
the
question,
what
constitutional
right?
unknown
speaker
suppose
for
a
moment
that
we
have
changed
the
facts
to
see
if
we
can
at
least
get
it
in
focus
for
me.
suppose
instead
of
having
been
killed
by
a
reason
of
a
bullet
that
jones
had
been
fleeing
in
a
car
and
the
police
car
pursued
him
and
at
some
point
ran
into
the
jones’
car
and
killed
him,
would
you
say
he
has
the
same
rights
that
you
have
been
trying
to
articulate
to
mr.
justice
stewart?
unknown
speaker
over
the
same
deprivation?
unknown
speaker
well
now,
you
are
talking
about
the
state
law
question.
unknown
speaker
justice
stewart
has
already
several
times
pointed
out
that
there
is
no
one
is
questioning
and
none
of
our
questions
are
addressed
to
the
problem
over
the
right
to
recover
under
colorado’s
state
law
for
the
wrongful-death,
if
it
can
be
shown.
questions
are
addressed
to
the
right
to
recover
under
the
federal
statute,
but
you
now
can
say
that
the
automobile
killing
would
not
be
the
same
as
the
shooting.
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
the
only
distinction,
the
intent?
unknown
speaker
well
it
would
be
just
as
easy
to
allege
that
with
respect
to
an
automobile
as
it
would
with
respect
to
a
gun,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
why
did
you
say
a
little
while
ago
that
you
sought
that
after,
that
you
have
realized
after
23
years
that
the
mother
had
to
be
suing
in
her
own
right?
unknown
speaker
could
she
sue
or
does
colorado
law
permit
or
does
1983
permit
a
mother
to
sue
to
recover
on
behalf
of
her
son
as
sort
of
a
survivor…
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
here
then
the
mother
could
not
proceed
on
that
basis?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
wrong
with
that?
unknown
speaker
oh,
a
colorado
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
you
are
talking
about
any
person
injured,
you
have
your
choice
of
your
theory
as
to
larry’s
mother,
which
you
were
urging
earlier
as
an
independent
constitutional
violation.
but
if
you
are
trying
to
recover
damages
for
the
injury
or
death
of
larry,
then
you
have
got
to
get
a
survivorship
statute
somewhere
i
would
think.
unknown
speaker
it
is
loss
of
income
to
his
mother
basically
or
loss
of...
unknown
speaker
now
what
is
your
authority
for
saying
that
federal
common
law
governs
1983
action?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
case
in
this
court?
unknown
speaker
has
this
court
ever
spoken
on
the
subject?
unknown
speaker
but,
the
difference
between
common
law
and
statutory
law
is
what?
unknown
speaker
but
where
do
we
find
the
federal
common
law?
unknown
speaker
it
is
in
the
statute,
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
unknown
speaker
i
am
still
trying
to
find
the
federal
law
that
gives
the
survivorship
right
to
the
mother.
unknown
speaker
the
federal
law
that
gives
the
survivorship
of
the
right
of
action
to
the
mother.
unknown
speaker
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
her
right
to
liberty
to
raise
her
child?
unknown
speaker
and
anybody
that
interferes
with
her
right
to
raise
her
child
is
subject
to
1983
action
if
it
is
a
state
officer?
unknown
speaker
he
or
she?
unknown
speaker
why
not
under
your
theory?
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn’t
the
mother
have
a
liberty
for
her
child
not
to
be
spanked
by
anybody
but
her?
unknown
speaker
or
it
is
limited
to
the
shot
in
the
back
of
the
head
case?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
know…
well,
how
far
does
it
go?
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
shot
him
in
the
back
in
the
head
in
self
defense?
unknown
speaker
but
he
used
excessive
force
in
the
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
jones
was
not
just
standing
on
the
sidewalk
or
walking
along
the
street
was
he
at
the
time
he
was
shot?
unknown
speaker
anyway
it
is
not
before
us
in
any
sense.
unknown
speaker
oh,
this
is
all
very
interesting
counsel
but
this
is
the
jury
case
that
is
already
been
decided,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
under
the
decision…
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
decision
was
adverse
see,
it
was
a…
unknown
speaker
and
you
did
not
bring
that
question
here,
did
you?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
this
was
submitted
as
a
negligence
case
to
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
where
did
court
say
that
in
the…
unknown
speaker
i
am
saying
that…
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
that
colorado
supreme
court
had
accepted
the
fact
that
there
could
be
and
that
it
would
entertain
a
1983
action
for
the
wrongful-death
of
the
son.
unknown
speaker
but
that
the
colorado
damage
limitations
would
apply
to
it.
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
that
the
only
cause
of
action
that
had
been
pleaded
here
in
the
complaint
was
a
1983
cause
of
action.
unknown
speaker
now,
would
you
have
thought
the
colorado
supreme
court
would
have
made
a
legal
error
if
the
case
had
come
to
it
in
that
posture
and
it
had
decided
just
what
it
did?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
suggest
that
the
--
i
know
you
probably
support
the
colorado
supreme
court’s
ruling
that
the
colorado
damage
limitation
applies.
unknown
speaker
are
you
arguing
here
that
no
1983
action
was
pleaded
at
all,
no
valid
action
was
pleaded
at
all?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
now,
apparently
the
colorado
supreme
court
did
not
rule
that
way,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
well
formally
though,
did
not
the
trial
court
dismiss
the
1983
claim?
unknown
speaker
and
then
your
supreme
court
--
if
i
read
the
opinion
at
page
48
in
the
appendix
correctly
however,
because
the
instant
suit
was
brought
in
state
court
and
joined
with
the
suit
under
the
state
wrongful-death
statute,
the
trial
court
properly
ruled
that
the
two
actions
were
merged,
so
that
the
1983
claim
should
be
dismissed.
unknown
speaker
well,
now
does
the
petition
for
certiorari
present
the
question
whether
or
not
the
action
in
dismissing
the
1983
claim
should
be
reviewed?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
they
get
here
if
as
it
gets
here,
we
have
a
judgment
dismissal
in
1983
claim?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
his
question
presented
in
the
petitioner’s
brief,
not
very
articulately
but
at
least
it
is
arguable
that
at
page
2
of
the
reply
brief,
arguable
that
he
is
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
limit
which
the
action
of
the
state
court
placed
on
a
1983
action
that
is
applying
the
colorado
deaths
by
wrongful
act
limit
as
justice
white
earlier
suggested
to
a
1983
action.
unknown
speaker
the
1983
action
was
dismissed
in
the
trial
court.
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
never
appealed.
unknown
speaker
and
so
that
is
out
of
the
case
and
i
do
not
quite
see
therefore
how
this
question
can
arise.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
back
up
into
this
question
presented.
unknown
speaker
well,
did
the
supreme
court
of
--
i
put
it
this
way.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
dissents
of
chief
justice
pringle
and
justice
groves
would
tend
to
support
you.
unknown
speaker
could
you
help
a
minute
in
this
appendix?
unknown
speaker
i
notice
on
page
1
in
the
chronological
list
of
documents
under
the
date
november
14,
1974,
your
motion
to
strike
the
third
claim
for
relief
which
is
the
1983
claim
was
granted,
is
that
right?
november
14,
1974.
unknown
speaker
alright,
now
when
you
turn
over
to
page
40,
this
is
after
the
trial,
it
was
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
unknown
speaker
that
is
right.
unknown
speaker
now,
the
supreme
court
and
the
supreme
court
and
what
i
read
you
at
page
48
of
its
opinion,
apparently
affirms
whatever
the
reason
might
be,
the
dismissal
of
a
1983
claim,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
says
in
so
many
terms,
in
so
many
words
that
the
1983
claim
should
be
dismissed
and
then
at
the
very
end
of
the
opinion
the
judgment
is
affirmed.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
why
not,
no
but
unless
they
assume
the
1983
action
has
been
wrongfully
dismissed
and
that
the
1983
action
is
there,
that
dissent
is
meaningless.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
unknown
speaker
now,
my
last
question.
unknown
speaker
but
in
any
event
if
it
does,
i
take
it
to
the
first
question
we
have
to
decide
that
is
whether
or
not
the
1983
action
was
properly
dismissed,
before
we
reach
the
question
of
measure
of
damages.
unknown
speaker
if
they
presented
now
that
in
the
question.
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
has
not
been
presented
with
any
crystal
clarity
i
must
say.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
that
before
we
get
to
your
issue
of
damages,
what
the
proper
test
whether
it
is
federal
or
state
of
damages,
we
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
you
have
a
1983
cause
of
action.
