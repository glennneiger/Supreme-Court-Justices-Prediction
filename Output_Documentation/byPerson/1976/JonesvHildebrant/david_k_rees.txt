mr.
david
k.
rees
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
cheif
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
i
am
david
rees;
i
represent
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
ruby
jones.
in
1973
ruby
jones
filed
the
complaint
in
the
denver
district
court
in
which
she
alleged
that
douglas
hildebrant,
bryan
maren
(ph)
and
the
city
and
county
of
denver
by
respondent
superior
had
killed
her
son
larry
by
shooting
him
in
the
back
of
the
head.
bryan
maren
was
subsequently
dismissed
from
that
suit
at
the
end
of
discovery.
the
action
proceeded
against
just
officer
hildebrant
and
the
city
and
county
of
denver.
her
complaint
stated
three
claims.
first,
battery
and
second
negligence,
both
of
these
claims
were
properly
brought
under
the
colorado
wrongful-death
act
and
are
controlled
by
colorado
law.
the
third
claim
was
brought
pursuant
to
42
u.
s.
c.
1983
and
is
a
federal
claim.
at
the
close
of
the
evidence,
well,
first
one,
in
answer
to
this
complaint,
hildebrant
and
the
city
said,
they
admitted
hildebrant
shot
larry
jones
intentionally
and
that
he
was
acting
under
colorado
state
law
when
he
did
so.
they
alleged…
mr.
david
k.
rees
the
record
is
silent,
what
in
fact
the
record
below
would
show
that
officer
hildebrant
was
responding
to
a
call
of
a
silent
burglar
alarm
and
that
he
was
pursuing
larry
jones,
who
was
allegedly
committing
a
burglary.
as
a
result,
hildebrant
alleged
that
he
was
acting
in
self
defense
and
he
also
alleged
that
larry
jones
was
a
fleeing
felon
and
that
the
shooting
was
justified
on
that
ground.
but
the
jury
rejected
both
of
those
defenses.
at
the
close
of
the
evidence
the
defendants
moved
to
dismiss
mrs.
jones'
claim
under
1983
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
redundant
with
her
state
claim.
mr.
david
k.
rees
yes,
specifically.
mr.
david
k.
rees
the
constitutional
claim
on
mrs.
jones’
behalf
and
it
is
her
claim
is
founded,
you
can
look
at
it
two
different
ways.
first,
this
court
is
held
on
several
occasions
that
a
parent
has
a
constitutional
right
to
raise
their
child
and
that
that
child
can
not
be
taken
from
them
without
the
due
process
of
law.
so,
in
armstrong
versus
manzo
and
in
the
stanley
case
this
court
held
that
the
state
could
not
deprive
a
parent
of
their
parental
rights
without
meeting
the
guidelines
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
in
the
meyer
versus
nebraska
case…
mr.
david
k.
rees
it
is
in
the…
mr.
david
k.
rees
yes
it
is.
mr.
david
k.
rees
yes,
in
particular
paragraph
12.
mr.
david
k.
rees
yeah,
we
alleged
the
elements
of
1983.
mr.
david
k.
rees
oh,
yes
it
has
been
treated
so
at
all
times
in
the
course
of
the
proceedings
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
colorado
circuit
court.
mr.
david
k.
rees
well,
we
drafted
it
that
way.
mr.
david
k.
rees
it
has
now
become
clear
after
four
years
that
it
is
her
right
that
it
would
be
improper
for
her
to
sue
on
behalf
of
her
son’s
right.
mr.
david
k.
rees
no,
and
the
reasoning
for
that
is
this.
gary
gilmore
has
right
to
disown
as
judge
lewis
in
the
tenth
circuit
said
at
the
morning
he
was
killed.
gary
gilmore
was
given
every
due
process
of
law.
mr.
david
k.
rees
that
is
right,
but
his
mother
had
no
rights
that
were
deprived
there.
in
other
words
--
let
me
try
and
make
the
distinction.
mr.
david
k.
rees
a
mother
does
not
have
the
right
not
to
have
her
son
killed.
a
mother
does
have
the
right
not
to
have
a
state
official
wrongfully
kill
her
son
and
that
is
the
distinction.
every
possible
due
process
was
afforded
to
gary
gilmore
and
he,
an
adult,
chose
not
to
file
any
further
papers
in
this
court,
and
judge
lewis
said,
“this
man
has
rights
too
and
here
the
mother
with
no
real
standing
just
tried
to
come
in
and
save
her
son’s
life."
i
think
that
is
a
significant
distinction.
mr.
david
k.
rees
the
original
complaint
and
the
amended
complaint
are
essentially
the
same.
the
difference
being
that
a
fourth
claim
from
relief
was…
mr.
david
k.
rees
right.
mr.
david
k.
rees
no
it
is.
do
you
mean
specific
statutory
citation
to
it?
mr.
david
k.
rees
i
think,
it
was,
i
maybe
wrong
about
that.
mr.
david
k.
rees
i
think,
we
just
under
fact
pleading
spread
the
elements,
but
there
was
no
question
at
any
point
on
any
of
the
party’s
part
--
this
was
a
1983
part.
mr.
david
k.
rees
it
is
probably
not
as
good
as
it
might
have
been,
but
under
fact
pleading
i
do
think
it
is
certainly
sufficient
and
there
was
no
question
about
notice
here.
all
the
parties
understood
that
this
was
a
1983
complaint.
mr.
david
k.
rees
the
theory
here
is
that
a
mother
--
and
i
can
get
this
in
two
different
ways.
first
of
all
that
a
mother
has
a
right
to
not
have
her
child
taken
whether
by
court
proceeding
or
by
bullet
by
a
state
official.
mr.
david
k.
rees
it
would
be
the
due
process
clause.
in
meyer
versus
nebraska
they
talked
about
the
term
'liberty'
and
they
construed
liberty
to
include
the
liberty
to
raise
children.
mr.
david
k.
rees
no,
he
should
not
have
been
shot
at
all.
mr.
david
k.
rees
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
david
k.
rees
the
part
that
you
shall
not
be
deprived
of
life
or
liberty
without
the
due
process
of
law.
mr.
david
k.
rees
well,
as
to
larry
it
was
his
life.
mr.
david
k.
rees
as
to
mrs.
jones,
it
was
her
liberty.
mr.
david
k.
rees
the
constitutional
violation
was
the
infringement
of
her
right
as
a
parent.
mr.
david
k.
rees
to
raise
her
child.
mr.
david
k.
rees
well,
for
example
in
meyer…
mr.
david
k.
rees
well,
in
answer
to
justice
rehnquist’s
question,
had
there
been
a
hearing
and
the
death
penalty
imposed
after
a
criminal
case
have
been
filed
against
him,
a
hearing
would
have
precluded
a
suit.
but
i
am
not
saying
that
they
should
have
held
the
hearing
before
he
wrongfully
shot
larry
in
the
back
of
the
head.
mr.
david
k.
rees
the
constitutional
deprivation
was
the
deprivation
to
raise
--
just
as
in
meyer…
mr.
david
k.
rees
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
david
k.
rees
what?
mr.
david
k.
rees
no,
we
are
not,
we
are
relying
on
the
word
'liberty'
primarily.
mr.
david
k.
rees
yes.
when
we
drafted
the
complaint
and
i
can
explain
that.
officer
hildebrant
is
white
and
larry
jones
is
black,
we
thought
there
might
be
a
problem
there
when
we
drafted
the
complaint.
in
the
course
of
discovery,
we
decided
that
the
equal
protection
claim
was
not
well
founded,
but
that
the
deprivation…
mr.
david
k.
rees
no,
but
we
did
not
feel
we
had
a
case
that
we
could
show.
mr.
david
k.
rees
our
federal
case
is
that
you
can
not
take
a
child’s
life
and
there
is
a
case
directly
as
was…
mr.
david
k.
rees
no,
it
is
also
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
eighth
circuit
has
held
specifically
on
that
with
identical
facts.
mattis
versus
schnarr,
in
mattis
versus
schnarr,
mattis
was
a
doctor
whose
son
was
killed
by
a
local
police
officer
who
was
chasing
young
mattis
and
fired
a
so-called
warning
shot
that
hit
him
in
the
head
and
killed
him,
and
mattis,
the
father,
brought
a
suit
under
1983,
and
the
missouri
court
held
that
that
was
proper.
there
are
other
cases
with
similar
facts
that
are
cited
in
the
brief
perkins
versus
selethia
(ph).
perhaps
i
can…
mr.
david
k.
rees
fourteenth
amendment
and
precisely
what
protects
is
the
same
--
right
to
liberty
would
be
the
keyword.
it
is
the
same
part
of
the
constitution
that
protected
the
plaintiffs
in
meyer
versus
nebraska
and
that
protected
the
plaintiffs
in
stanley
versus
illinois.
mr.
david
k.
rees
that
is
right.
mr.
david
k.
rees
no,
i
am
talking
about
very
substantive
liberty.
i
am
talking
about
not
being
shot
in
back
of
the
head,
your
son
shot
in
the
back
of
the
head.
mr.
david
k.
rees
oh,
yes.
mr.
david
k.
rees
that
is
correct,
but
you
must
look,
i
think
to
whether
there
is
a
right
that
it
finds
protection
and
the
answer
to
that
is
you
do
have
a
right
in
your
children.
it
is
one
of
the
very
essentials
of
life
and
that
is
what
is
been
held
in
this
whole
series
of
cases
that
i
have
argued.
perhaps
if
i
can
explain
the
background...
mr.
david
k.
rees
oh,
no.
i
would
disagree
with
that.
it
is
very
narrowly
restricted,
it
is
narrow…
mr.
david
k.
rees
and
where
there
has
been
a
constitutional
right
infringement.
mr.
david
k.
rees
the
right
to
raise
your
child.
there
is
a…
mr.
david
k.
rees
no,
you
would
have
very
simply
negligence
action
under
state
law.
mr.
david
k.
rees
well,
but
injury
is
only
one
element.
you
got
to
have
the
intentional
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights
under
1983
and
unless
all
of
those
elements
are
met,
then
the
plaintiff
can
not
recover.
perhaps,
i
can
put
this
in
historical
perspective
and
make
it
clear.
courts
have
held
traditionally
that
the
civil
rights
acts
are
deficient
on
the
issues
standing
to
bring
suits
and
there
are
several
court
decisions
brazier
versus
cherry
is
probably
the
leading
one,
there
is
also
a
footnote
in
moor
versus
county
of
alameda
that
you
can
look
at
state
law
on
the
issue
of
standing
and
that
where
the
state
has
a
wrongful-death
statute
which
provides
an
independent
right
in
the
survivor
that
that
will
give
them
standing
under
1983
and
that
was
one
of
the
things
pointed
out
in
mattis
versus
schnarr,
and
colorado
does
have
such
a
statute,
and
so,
mrs.
jones
properly
did
bring
this
suit.
mr.
david
k.
rees
well
that
is
an
alternative
ground
--
i
instated
initially
that
there
were
two
ways
in
which
you
could
use
this
as
it
is
being
proper
to
mrs.
jones.
mr.
david
k.
rees
correct.
mr.
david
k.
rees
yes
that
one
would
be
--
i
mean
if
they
intentionally
drove
their
automobile
into
the
back
of
larry’s
car
and
killed
him,
then
a
1983
action
would
be
proper.
mr.
david
k.
rees
certainly.
as
an
attorney
i
tried
to
sign
pleadings
that
reflect
the
facts
as
i
see
them.
in
this
case
officer
hildebrant
admitted
that
he
shot
him
intentionally.
negligence
was
never
an
issue
in
this
case
and
if
he
had
said
i
tripped
while
i
was
chasing
and
when
the
gun
went
off,
that
would
have
been
certainly
a
defense
for
1983
claim,
but
that
just
was
not
what
happened
here.
what
happened
here
is
he
shot
the
kid
in
the
back
of
the
head.
mr.
david
k.
rees
well,
right,
we
thought…
mr.
david
k.
rees
under
scheuer
versus
rhodes,
yes
the
survivorship
action
would
be
proper.
the
problem
we
had...
mr.
david
k.
rees
well,
in
her
inside
she
could
have,
but
that
would
have
been
first
of
all
a
different
claim,
that
would
have
been
a
claim
for
larry’s
rights
and
not
for
her
right,
one.
two…
mr.
david
k.
rees
the
problem
with
us
is
whereas
at
the
time
that
there
was
a
case,
there
was
a
case,
perkins
versus
selethia.
mr.
david
k.
rees
no,
it
is
not.
it
is
a
federal
district
court
case
and
it
comes
from
connecticut
and
i
think
it
is
since
been
overruled,
not
directly
but,
in
light
of
other
decisions,
but
it
said
specifically
you
could
not
do
that.
mr.
david
k.
rees
under
1983.
it
said
only
if
there
is
a
wrongful-death
action
so
that
the
mother
can
bring
the
action
in
her
own
name
will
we
permit
that
suit,
and
in
view
of
the
perkins
case,
and
in
view
of
the
cases
that
said
it
was
proper
to
posture
the
case
as
we
had
postured
it.
we
chose
to
posture
it
that
way.
we
could
have
postured
it
either
way,
because
colorado
had
both
statutes
and
simply
because
of
the
perkins
case,
we
chose
to
plead
it
the
way
we
did.
or
four
years
ago
i
would
posture
it
both
ways
to
protect
myself
and
to
try
and
recover
even
additional
damages
on
behalf
of
larry.
but
that
is
how
inside.
mr.
david
k.
rees
well
the
colorado
supreme
court
said,
one,
ruby
jones
would
have
had
no
standing
at
all,
unless
you
look
to
the
colorado
wrongful-death
statute,
and
if
you
are
going
to
utilize
the
colorado
wrongful-death
statute
on
the
issue
of
standing,
you
must
incorporate
its
remedy
as
well.
the
theory
there
is
that
where
the
federal
law
is
silent
on
an
issue
you
look
to
state
law
to
fill
the
gap,
and
we
would
argue
that
even
if
you
look
to
the
colorado
statue
to
give
mrs.
jones
standing
to
bring
this
suit,
there
is
no
gap
with
respect
to
the
remedies.
so,
the
colorado
court
held
that
if
we
had
filed
a
1983
action
in
federal
court
that
the
net
pecuniary
loss
rule
or
colorado
law
would
have
been
engrafted
onto
-
and
that
is
their
language
-
our
claim
in
federal
court.
so,
they
said
that
the
colorado
rule
of
damages
could
govern
a
claim
brought
under
the
federal
statute.
mr.
david
k.
rees
that
was
not
a
matter
of
survival…
mr.
david
k.
rees
merged
it,
that
it
was
the
simply
the
same
measure
of
damages…
mr.
david
k.
rees
that
because
it
has
the
same
measure
of
damages
it
would
be
duplicitous
and
there
is
no
need
to
instruct
the
jury
on
both
of
them.
that
was
the
whole
basis
of
their
ruling
and
the
reason
why
we
petitioned
for
certiorari.
perhaps,
if
i
can
answer
your
question
justice
blackmun
in
another
way,
given
that
decision
as
it
stands
now,
if
i
were
to
file
another
suit
in
colorado
on
behalf
of
--
a
different
case
on
behalf
of
larry,
then
the
colorado
limitations
on
recovery
for
survivorship
statutes,
i
am
not
sure
exactly
what
they
are,
would
also
apply
and
would
govern
the
federal
law.
what
they
have
done
here
is
they
have
restricted
a
statute
with
the
very
purpose
of
that
statute
was
to
provide
a
remedy,
supplemental
to
a
state
remedy.
mr.
david
k.
rees
i
agree,
we
have
not
alleged
damages
on
larry’s
behalf
in
this
suit,
nor
did
the
damages
that
we
seek...
mr.
david
k.
rees
well,
loss
of
income
is
covered
under
the
colorado
net
pecuniary
loss
rule
and
that
would
be
covered
in
the
$1500
that
was
awarded
by
the
jury.
we
do
not
seek
double
recovery
for
that.
the
items
of
damage
which
we
think
are
particularly
appropriate
in
this
case
and
which
are
available
under
the
federal
common
law
that
governs
1983
actions.
mr.
david
k.
rees
probably,
the
leading
case
is
batista
versus
weir.
mr.
david
k.
rees
no
that
is
a
third
circuit
case.
mr.
david
k.
rees
this
court
has
not
used
the
words
common
law
to
my
knowledge.
however,
in
sullivan
versus
little
hunting
park,
where
the
court
was
dealing
with
a
case
that
came
under
1981,
but
like
1983
as
governed
by
42
u.s.c.
1988
under
damages
issue.
the
court
said
that
the
measure
of
damages
can
be
drawn
from
either
federal
or
state
sources,
but
that
the
remedy
is
a
federal
remedy
and
responsive
to
where
a
federal
right
has
been
infringed.
this
makes
sense
that
federal
common
law
should
govern
this
action
for
two
reasons:
first
of
all,
federal
common
law
traditionally
applies
in
the
enclaves
of
law
that
are
of
specific
federal
concerns.
labor
law,
maritime
law
and
given
a
history
of
this
statute,
civil
rights
is
certainly
one
of
those
enclaves.
mr.
david
k.
rees
well,
the
federal
common
law
as
judicial
law
construing...
mr.
david
k.
rees
the
courts
make
the
federal
common
law
by
construing
the
statute.
mr.
david
k.
rees
it
is
constructions
of
the
statutes
of
1988,
that
is
right.
but
on
occasions,
courts
have
gone
quite
beyond
the
statutes,
for
example
in
shaw
versus
garrisons,
the
louisiana
--
that
was
a
federal
court
in
louisiana,
as
a
matter
the
federal
common
law
said
that
the
action
could
survive,
even
though
there
was
no
federal
survivorship
statute
and
even
though,
under
the
louisiana
law
the
action
would
have
died.
mr.
david
k.
rees
excuse
me
your
honor.
mr.
david
k.
rees
well,
the
right
of
action
is
through
1983
in
the
constitutional
right.
that
is
right,
and
the
constitutional
right
is
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
david
k.
rees
that
is
right.
specifically
what
the
language
of…
mr.
david
k.
rees
if
he
intentionally…
mr.
david
k.
rees
i
would
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
any
kind
of
interference.
i
mean
if
a
policeman
--
if
a
school
teacher
beats
your
son
in
school,
i
do
not
think
that
will
give
rise
sincerely
to
a
1983
action.
mr.
david
k.
rees
well
i
was
leading
particularly
to
the
court’s
recent
decision
that...
mr.
david
k.
rees
i
guess
not
your
honor.
no,
and
she
does
not
have
that
liberty.
but
she
does
have
the
liberty
not
to
have
her
child
shot
in
the
back
of
the
head.
mr.
david
k.
rees
well,
no.
mr.
david
k.
rees
i
do
not
know
how
far
it
goes.
mr.
david
k.
rees
then
the
jury
comes
in
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
and
we
lose
everything,
we
lose
the
state
claim
too.
mr.
david
k.
rees
that
is
right,
and
then
he
had
no
reason
--
yes
under
the
circumstances
that
would…
mr.
david
k.
rees
he
was
running
away
from
the
police
officer
the
time
he
was
shot.
mr.
david
k.
rees
it
is
not
before
you
in
any
sense
and
it
is
not
in
even
in
the
record.
mr.
david
k.
rees
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
david
k.
rees
the
question
that
i
presented
was,
did
the
colorado
courts
err
when
they
held
that
this
action
is
governed
by
the
colorado
net
pecuniary
loss
rule.
mr.
david
k.
rees
oh
no,
this
notion
was
made
at
the
end
of
the
evidence,
it
was
the
amended
complaint.
mr.
david
k.
rees
it
does
not
have
the
reference
to
the
statute,
but
we…
mr.
david
k.
rees
i
do
not
remember.
mr.
david
k.
rees
i
think
that
is
fair.
mr.
david
k.
rees
the
sum
is
$500,
of
course
she
will
never
see
a
penny
of
that
money.
mr.
david
k.
rees
the
net
pecuniary
loss
rule.
mr.
david
k.
rees
thank
you
your
honor.
