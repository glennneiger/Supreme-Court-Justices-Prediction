justice
william

rehnquist
is
there
some
difference
in
the
elements
necessary
to
prove
recovery
as
you
understand
that
as
between
section
1983
claim
might
was
pleaded
such
as
it
was
pleaded
here
in
the
colorado
wrongful-death
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
to
take
the
substance
of
the
action
rather
than
the
remedy,
if
the
plaintiff
makes
out
a
claim
under
the
wrongful-death
statute
under
these
circumstances,
would
he
also
make
out
a
claim
under
1983
and
vice
versa?
