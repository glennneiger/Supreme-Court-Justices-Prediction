mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
segal
started
his
remarks
by
referring
to
the
uncontroverted
facts,
i
hope,
i
maybe
allowed
to
have
your
indulgence
for
say
five
minutes
of
my
time
to
controvert
the
uncontroverted
facts.
i
hope
also
that
if
i
fail
to
controvert
some
of
them
in
the
course
of
this
argument
before
this
court,
and
my
failure
to
do
that,
will
not
be
considered
an
omission.
we
have
a
case,
your
honor
of
a
vertical
integration.
what
has
happened
is,
that
a
largest
bowling
supplier,
the
maker
of
the
equipment
used
by
bowling
center
operations,
integrated
forward
into
the
bowling
operation
business.
it
made
the
pinsetters
which
are
the
most
costly
equipment
that
a
bowling
center
has
to
use,
had
to
buy,
and
it
made
the
lanes.
it
represents
the
--
for
each
center
who
buys
from
brunswick,
perhaps
a
$700,
000
of
investment,
if
it’s
a
40
lane
which
is
not
an
uncommon
size.
there
we
start,
your
honor
and
come
in
1960,s
and
my
adversary
will
have
you
believe
that
in
1960”s
brunswick
tided
on
the
edge
of
banks.
no
such
thing,
not
even
in
the
worst
years,
which
preceded
its
decision
to
go
into
the
bowling
center
operation
business,
but
was
it
anyways
near
that,
indeed
in
its
worst
years,
its
collection
received
from
bowling
center
debtors
were
$87
million
and
more,
taking
away
interest
on
debts
were
like
and
this
has
been
broken
down
to
the
bowling
operation,
you
have
a
balance
on
the
plus
side
of
cash
flow
of
$32
million.
this
is
the
giant
which
judge
gibbons
referred
to
coming
into
the
land
of
the
pigmies
which
all
of
the
bowling
center
operated
the
debt
to
brunswick
itself.
now,
if
we
cast
the
case
into
an
abstract,
theoretical
case,
about,
is
it
all
right
to
recover
damages
for
mere
presence,
which
is
the
language
and
forgive
me,
your
honor,
is
i
think
it’s
somewhat
unfortunate
language,
which
is
in
first
questions
premise.
if
you
cast
it
in
so
general
ways
than
you
discount,
the
whole
factual
showing
of
what
this
case
was
about.
the
twice
pride
case,
the
10
year
case,
the
case
in
which
judge
ripple
made
many
findings
about
predatory
practices,
a
case
in
which
unlike
my
advisory’s
representation
to
the
court,
there
were
independent
findings
made
by
judge
ripple
on
the
equity
side,
in
addition
to
the
findings
made
by
the
jury
itself.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
i
am
so
sorry.
now,
we
had
not
only
judge
ripple
making
findings
of
practices
which
would
be
not
possible
for
any
competitor
or
of
the
plaintiffs
other
than
an
integrated
supplier
and
bowling
center
operator.
but
we
also
had
the
third
circuit,
endorsing
these
findings
and
saying
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
present
to
the
jury
on
the
later
part
of
section
7,
that
is
to
say
on
a
substantial
lessening
of
competition
and
a
tendency
to
create
a
monopoly.
now,
if
your
honor,
please,
a
fact
is
a
fact
as
mrs.
wiggins
said,
the
taste
is
one
which
bristles
with
such
a
smart,
a
something
casual,
some
by-product
get
bristles
with
that.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
my
position
is
that
is
wisdom
your
honor,
the…
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
i
say
the
damages
may
be,
and
i
would
like
to
explain
that
if
i
might
justice
white.
the
presence
itself
is
not
something
which
happened
in
one
split
instant
of
time,
when
brunswick
acquired
a
bowling
center.
the
presence
is
something
which
has
started
that
way
and
that
was
illegal
on
the
premise
which
mr.
segal
expects
and
which
is
in
your
questions
and
it
continues
a
retention,
holding
on.
this
court
has
said
in
so
many
words,
in
it
&
t
and
(inaudible)
is
equally
acquisition
and
acquisition
itself
is
what
is
prohibited
under
section
7,
providing
the
whole
statute
to
satisfy,
providing
there
is
also
the
necessary
tendency
effect.
now,
there
is
no
magic
in
probability
as
opposed
to
established
lessoning
in
competition,
if
the
tort
is
the
acquisition
and
if
the
plaintiff
can
show
damages
causal
from
that
tort
then
he
satisfies,
it
seems
to
me,
the
normal
test
for
a
damages.
and
may
i
suggest,
that
here
your
honor,
the
acquisition
itself
is
contaminated,
not
just
because
it
is
an
acquisition
but
because
the
trial
court
and
the
third
circuit
agreed,
felt
that
it
was
wrong
to
bring
into
the
small
markets,
the
pygmies
referred
to
by
judge
gibbons,
the
integrated
strength
of
the
brunswick
corporation.
that
is
vividly
illustrated
by
the
circumstance
that
it
is
a
predator
and
all
these
fellows
were,
it
is
debtors
or
at
least
half
of
them.
the
brunswick
was
number
one
but
they
had
a
size
of
a
competitor
in
amf,
which
incidentally
the
third
circuit
noted,
did
not
see
fit
to
go
forward
at
integrate
in
competition
with
its
own
customers.
so,
this
acquisition
is
wrong
because
it
brings
into
this
market,
the
power
of
brunswick.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
your
honor,
this
is
what
is
called
a
new
question
in
this
but
i
think
we
may
analogies
to
cases
involving
status.
i
was
about
to
say
the
status
here
is
an
unlawful
status
of
brunswick
in
these
three
small
markets.
it
had
no
business
being
there,
when
the
fox
goes
into
the
hen
house,
it
is
bad
for
him
to
be
there
from
the
first,
we
do
not
have
to
wait
for
former
to
route
him
out
with
shot.
so
it
is
the
status,
your
honor,
which
i
think
is
wrong.
it
may
not
apply
to
every
acquisition
but
it
is
seems
to
me
it
applies
to
the
acquisitions
here
and
i
would
like
to
break
down
what
happened
because
i
think
this
is
critical
to
first
question.
brunswick
had
many
thousands
of
pinsetters
out
on
the
installment
plan.
brunswick
sold
them
under
conditional
bills,
sale
and
with
a
right
to
foreclose
on
the
property,
in
the
event
of
non-payment.
what
brunswick
did
was
in
most
instances,
when
it
was
dissatisfied
that
it
could
not
get
paid,
is
to
repossess
both
the
pinsetters
which
are
automatic
equipment
for
setting
up
pins
in
an
alley
and
without
which
today,
there
is
almost
no
bowling
done.
both
the
pinsetters
and
the
lanes
which
are
of
thin
veneer
wood
sitting
on
a
cement
base
and
which
are
easily
removable.
they
removed
them
and
resold
them.
thus
step
one
is,
brunswick
exercise
to
choice.
once
it
decides
to
repossess
those
pinsetters
and
lanes,
the
bowling
center,
as
a
practical
matter
could
no
longer
function.
this
isn’t
the
case
where
the
market
necessarily
put
out
one
of
the
weak
competitors.
brunswick
put
out
of
business
it
is
own
customer
by
deciding
to
go
this
route.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
it
also
has
that
function
of
being
a
bank
..
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
no,
if
it
stayed
in
the
banking
business,
certainly
not,
but
if
as
a
bank,
it
decided
to
foreclose
on
a
delinquent
creditor,
in
order
now
to
take
over
its
business
and
go
into
a
different
market,
i
would
submit,
yes
there
is
something
wrong.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
your
honor,
there
is
a
shifting
of
the
nature,
of
the
power
which
is
brought
into
the
market.
i
could
conceive
of
a
situation,
if
which
one
of
the
world
biggest
corporations
went
in
to
bowling
center
operation
business,
without
any
potential
of
impact
of
lessening
of
competition,
in
which
case,
is
that
potential
wasn’t
there,
even
the
subjunctive
language
of
the
statute
that
is
may
substantiate
to
lessen
or
tend
to
create
a
monopoly,
even
that
language
would
not
be
satisfied
as
thus
there
would
be
no….
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
well,
it
could
convert
money
into
power
and
if
it
converted
money
into
power
then
certainly,
the
case
becomes
similar,
that
for
your
honor,
i
rated
with
your
question….
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
one
is
horizontal
and..
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
in
a
horizontal
in
fact
this,
is
how,
the
moment
brunswick
becomes
a
bowling
center
proprietor,
then
it
is
the
horizontal
competitor
of
these
other
bowling
proprietors
in
the
same
competitive
market
and
it's
then
that
this
power
which
we
complain
comes
into
play,
but
i
want
it
to
--
if
i
may,
break
down
this
acquisitions
into
two
steps,
the
first
i
describe,
as
being
an
effect
the
foreclosure,
the
second
is
the
choice
made
by
brunswick,
which
was
to
run
the
center
as
a
bowling
center,
bowling
center
consists
more
of
--
just
the
lanes
and
automatic
pinsetters,
there
are
liquor
licenses,
restaurant,
nurseries
involved
in
big
parking
lot,
in
a
piece
of
real
estates
zone,
to
make
a
bowling
center
and
goodwill
as
well.
brunswick
decided
to
do
it
that
way.
now,
this
isn’t
then
a
case
where
we
had
confronted
was
what
happened
in
the
market?
brunswick
quoted
for
a
bonus,
on
the
debt,
and
the
record
has
much
evidence
that
when
it
chose
to
do
so,
it
did
that.
it
did
that
in
san
juan
for
years,
it
did
that
in
jacksonville,
florida
and
else
where.
it
just
made
more
favorable
arrangements
with
the
debtors,
because
i
suppose,
it
thought
that
this
way
it
had
some
future
prospective
being
paid
in
full,
for
what
did
it
sold,
so
that
was
a
choice
which
it
did
make
in
this….
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
find
that
a
difficult
question
because
i
-
without
knowing
the
message
used
and
to
accomplished
that
i
wouldn’t
know
whether
we
couldn’t
find
it
will
run
or
foul
to
the
law,
it
might
very
well,
if
not
having
engaged
in
a
acquisition
run
or
foul
of
section
2,
or
section
1
as
well
of
the
sherman
act.
this
is
really
a
clash
of
policy,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
or
forbear,
make
it
easier
to
pay.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
no,
we
couldn’t
have
a
complaint
unless
we
work
in
that
competitive
market
and
we
would
definitely
treat
it,
then
i
think,
we
might
well
have
a
complain
and
indeed,
we
had
an
aspect
of
this
case
that
involves
that,
which
we
ultimately
lost
on.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
if
only
did
was
to
forbear
and
not
for
us,
you
might
have
had
a
violation
of
2(a)
of
robinson-patman
act.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
yes.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
eloquently,
if
your
honors
would
be
good
enough
to
just
look
at
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
it
answers
i
think
this
question
as
well
as
a
question
which
mr.
segal
answered
about
selling
below
cost.
i
have,
we
have
an
appendix
here.
in
appendix
a,
it's
1(a)
attached
to
this
brief
of
the
respondents.
this
is
taken
from
the
records
of
the
brunswick
and
it
shows
how
these
centers
were
run.
if
you
would
look
at
the
first
line
from
‘65
through
‘68,
delmont
or
at
a
loss
each
year,
same
from
‘69
to
‘70
then
a
small
profit
in
‘71
and
in
’72.
we
also
have
highlighted
an
aspect
to
the
case
pointed
to
how
much
it
would
be
in
the
hands
of
the
independent
proprietor,
using
testimony
which
showed
that
that
they
had
at
least
a
differential
of
$2000
laying
in
advantage
because
they
did
not
pay
themselves
for
their
machines,
the
cost
of
annual
payment
and
the
interest
made
this
$2000
difference.
but
in
any
case,
they
run
these
centers
as
you
see
year
after
year
at
a
loss.
dutchess,
they
ran
into
loss
until
finally
they
got
tired
of
it,
and
they
stopped
running
it
at
all.
now,
interstate
was
run
only
for
the
first
year
at
loss,
and
you
would
have
to
thought
that
the
enemy
troops
had
marched
on
city
hall
if
you
read
the
reply
brief
of
my
adversary
about
that
circumstance
because
he
says
well,
we
were
misrepresenting
to
the
court
that
it
was
run
at
a
loss
and
fairlawn
is
one
center,
one
of
the
number
of
centers
in
the
paramus
market
where
in
fact,
a
profit
took
place,
but
if
your
eyes
goes
down
to
page,
you
see
there
were
others
there,
tenpin
in
the
mall,
the
one
closest
to
our
center
in
the
paramus,
that
run
at
a
loss,
lodi,
run
at
a
loss.
now,
sir,
that’s
an
answer
to
the
question
about
price
as
well?
if
the
deep
pocket
runs
centers
for
five
years
at
a
loss,
that
means
the
price
wasn’t
sufficient
to
yield
a
profit
and
it
means
that
one
reason
or
another
and
i
am
not
trying
to
argue
the
section
2
aspects...
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
these
losses
are
essentially
derived
including
the
parenthesis.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
the
comparison
is
based
upon
our
testimony
but
the
loss
figures
for
brunswick
are
simply
taken
off
their
in
evidence
and
part
of
the
appendix.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
well,
if
your
honors
please,
the
thing
that
is
critical
is
that
because
we
feel
and
i
think
this
court
has
a
numerous
damage
cases
brief
with
us,
that
once
you
have
tort
submitted
and
show
the
violation,
you
don’t
have
to
go
with
mathematical
precision
to
your
damage
demonstration.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
but
you
see
your
honor,
if
may
i
had
this
if
you
have
to
charge,
let’s
say
an
advertising
program
to
a
loss
or
profit
by
the
competitors,
it
is
an
exceedingly
difficult
thing
to….
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
my
action
for
damages
–
i
would
be
able
to
claim
no
damages
in
that
case.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
..on
the
theory
present.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
your
honor,
we
have
proved
and
i
think
the
record
is
clear
in
this.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
if
your
honor
please,
if
the
wrong
doer
puts
the
company
out
of
business,
then
the
natural
economic
course
has
been
changed
by
the
wrong,
it's
has
been
change
by
the
substitution
of
this
deep
pocket
or
a
company
which
not
might
but
would
have
gone
out
of
the
business
and
here
with
very
respect
to
third
circuit
erred
in
my
opinion.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
all
three
centers
standards
involved
did
not
go
out
of
business
but
we
have
also
carried
operations
at
a
loss.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
the
difference
is
that
in
a
normal
course,
an
independent
operator,
operating
a
center
at
a
losing
rate
is
going
to
go
out
of
the
business.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
precisely,
there
is
also
evidence
now,
if,
with
great
respect,
it's
also
evidence
as
to
the
power
to
control
price.
normally….
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
your
honor,
it
is
donnish,
there
is
evidence
about
price
changes
here
and
there,
there
are
all
kinds
of
evidence
under
attempts
to
prove
second
part
of
section
7,
but
it
isn’t
tied
with
precision
to
damages
to
these
three
plaintiffs.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
we
submit,
the
price
is
necessarily
lowered
because
normally
in
the
market
the
price
would
be
enough
to
reflect
these
some….
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
your
honor
those
are
not
the
two
antipodal
things,
i
hope.
the
two
policies
are
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
which
is
designed
to
create
a
private
vendors
for
antitrust
violation
in
great
numbers
to
augment
the
forces
over
the
department
of
justice
and
which
provides
with
no
exceptions
for
threefold
damages
and
for
attorney’s
fees
wherever
the
plaintiff
has
been
injured
in
his
business
or
property
by
reason
of
a
violation
of
antitrust
laws.
that
policy
is
an
important
one
and
it
applies
to
section
7
as
is
indicated
by
legislative
history
not
just
statements
of
people
which
mr.
justice
jackson
said,
aren’t
read
by
the
president
when
he
signs
bills
but
it's
by
what
the
congress
did,
1914
clayton
act
section7,
prohibition
of
acquisition
of
stock,
directly
or
indirectly
in
a
competitor.
three
bills
went
through,
the
first
two
would
have
not
put
that
under
section
for
threefold
damages.
the
final
bill
that
went
out
did.
in
1950,
once,
more,
modification
of
section7,
now,
to
include
the
remedy
for
what
had
become
the
lawyer’s
device
to
escape
old
section7
and
that
was
to
throw
the
acquisition
of
assets
as
well
as
stock
in
to
section7
and
when
that
happened,
congress
again
had
a
chance
that
to
change
the
section4.
it
did
not
do
so,
justice
pastore
(ph)
in
the
antitrust
laws,
we
made
again
the
change
this
time
with
section
4,
in
which
among
other
things
of
state
was
given
a
right
sue
or
injury
done
to
citizens.
though
has
been
made
to
take
that
with
section
7
from
the
thrust
of
section
4,
so,
then
that’s
the
policy.
is
there
a
policy
opposite?
is
there
policy
in
favor
of
acquisition
by
capital?
i
suggest
that
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
in
a
philadelphia
bank
case.
the
policy
is
the
opposite.
the
policy
is
to
not
to
expand
by
taking
over
the
businesses
and
ingenuity
and
efforts
of
other
man,
but
to
do
it
internally.
that’s
what
the
congress
was
after.
it
only
maybe
done
under
section
7,
when
it
is
done
in
such
a
way
as
to
satisfy
the
reach
of
statute,
do
i
am
permitted
to
do
on
failing
business?
i
have
three
minutes
left.

the
principal
products
are
the
automatic
pinsetting
equipment
which
is
further
more
costly.
it's
about
$8500
and
that
valid
sum
over
the
years
per

and
you
can

that’s
very
sizable
and
then
about
$4500
for
the

itself.
the

are
the
principal

there
are

there
is
continuous,
if
your
mind
is
reaching
to
it's
commerce,
there
is
continuous
maintenance

and
much
more
credit
relations
which
have
to
be

for.
mr.

hoffmann
was
it
known
at
the
time
of
filing,
it
was
believed
to
be
20
years,
it
was
not
known
then
because
automatic
pinsetters
were
discovered
by

landed
by

in
about
1956.
mr.

the
bowling
balls
and

and
the
other

yes
there
is
such
evidence.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
i
don’t
have
the.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
it
is
small
percentage.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
for
the
regular
--
the
machine
themselves,
the
pinsetter’s
machines,
your
honor.
these
regular
servicing
which
includes
repair
parts,
these
things
are
under
great
pressure.
heavy
balls,
roll
gum,
the
alley
and
those
repair
parts
come
from
brunswick.
the
machines
needs
servicing
and
so
on
so,
this
is
a
continuous
aspect
of
business
which
i
can
break
out
for
you
now,
but
it
is
in
the
record
as
the
(inaudible)
there
is
a
page
a1603
in
our
appendix
and
it's
the
set
up
under
the
heading
a
machine
and
miscellaneous.
the
machines
and
miscellaneous,
the
servicing
aspects
of
them
are
3%
of
the
gross
income
figure.
the
pro-shop
and
other
things
that
give
supplies
add
to
that.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
it's
no
dilemma
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
because
this
is
a
matter
for
defense
failing
business.
it's
not
all
together
clear,
that’s
even
desirable
to
have
such
a
defense.
but
it
is
never
been
held
nor
even
suggest
that
failing
business
is
a
state
of
nature
which
prevents
the
operation
of
section
7,
and
in
the
buslowe
case
and
in
the
citizens
power
bidding
and
the
international
shoe
and
all
the
historic
failing
business
cases,
that
was
made
clear
and
what
meant
to
be
shown
was
not
even
asserted
by
the
defendant.
part
of
this,
was
not
even
in
their
pleadings,
ever
attempt
made
at
the
trial,
example,
to
show
that
there
was
no
viable
alternative
but
the
brunswick
acquisition
was
part
of
showing
necessary
and
indeed
as
to
couple
of
the
centers
which
were
picked
up
bankruptcy
sale,
brunswick
urge
is
even
now
that
that
they
should
be
separately
dealt
with,
fail
on
and
in
a
state
they
say
were
profit
making
centers
but
even
there
said
is,
there
were
other
people
who
wanted
to
bowling.
there
was
indeed
the
curious
episode
where
somebody
bought
a
center
and
within
24
hours
time
he
was
given
a
$5000
profit
by
brunswick.
indeed
brunswick
called
up
the
chairman
of
board
at
11
o’clock
at
night.
this
is
all
in
the
evidence
in
order
to
get
the
approval
to
buy
back
from
one
mr.
victorla
(ph),
a
center
which
he
had
taken
at
that
bankruptcy
sale
that
you
don’t
have
the
elements
of
the
defense.
you
have
no
consideration
given,
to
the
alternatives.
failing
business
is
not
a
formative
prescription
of
law.
you
don’t
make
a
determination,
that,
well,
this
is
a
failing
business
therefore
it's
already…
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
i
didn’t
so
read
that
your
honor.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
i
was
much
more
concerned
about
commerce.
mr.
malcolm
a.
hoffmann
your
honor,
if
brunswick
has
the
chance
in
a
new
trial,
i
am
sure
they
will
make
some
effort
to
repair
this
mischief.
but
i
don’t
think
the
remand
is
to
be
interpreted
that
way
on
failing
business.
remand
essentially
is
on
instructions.
thank
you
very
much.
