unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
did
the
jury
obtain
a
general
verdict,
mr.
segal
or
..?
unknown
speaker
but
there
were
no
special
and
derogatory.
unknown
speaker
mr.
segal,
how
about
..was
there
a
prayer
for
equitable
relief?
unknown
speaker
and
on
the
section
seven
case.
unknown
speaker
were
there
proceedings
held
by
the
judge
going
to
equitable
relief.
unknown
speaker
but
did
he
give
some
equitable
relief.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
(inaudible),
did
he
make
some
findings?
unknown
speaker
or
he
said
a
lot
of
things
about
the
facts.
unknown
speaker
so,
why
it
may
be
that
the….
unknown
speaker
but
it
also
one
of
the
--
it's
also
maybe
one
of
the
reasons
that
you
just
can’t
ignore
them.
unknown
speaker
but
the
question
that
you
raised
here
we
must
assume
that
there
has,
--we
judged
this
case
on
the
assumption;
there
was
a
violation
of
section
7.
unknown
speaker
your
arguments
take
up
from
that
point.
unknown
speaker
but
is
it
that
you
make
that
assumption
with
respect
to
the
second
question
as
well
as
first.
unknown
speaker
is
that
question
that
the
failing
company
defends
there?
unknown
speaker
for
that
question
only
assume
there
is
a
violation?
unknown
speaker
i
will
take
it
you
are
also
willing
to
assume
that
the
act
which
was
a
violation
namely
the
acquisition
also
caused
some
damages.
unknown
speaker
just
the
very
act.
unknown
speaker
well
i
know
but
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
there
was
not
any,
that
whatever
damage
was
caused
was
not
cause
by
any
lessening
of
competition.
unknown
speaker
bowling
alley
is
not
a
--
you
said
yes,.
unknown
speaker
with
elah
bradman
(ph)
and
justice
white’s
expression
on
it,
there
is
at
least
about
fourth
clause
variation
here,
it
is
there
in
the
sense
of
acquisition
by
brunswick
and
the
loss
or
profits
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiffs.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
isn’t
there
at
least
that
so,
you
argue
from
there
rather
than
arguing
whether
there
was
but
for...
unknown
speaker
but
the
mere
presence
was
the
violation?
unknown
speaker
alright
and
what
you
are
willing
to
assume
that
all
the
damage,
that
there
was
damage
from
mere
presence
but
that
that
is
not
what
damage
has
to
flow
from
you
are
saying
..
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying,
we
are
going
to
see
some..
unknown
speaker
will
you
create
mere
presence
with
mere
survival?
unknown
speaker
survival
of
these
failing
allies
bowling
allies.
unknown
speaker
the
question
put
to
you
by
mr.
justice
white,
used
the
word
damage,
resulting
from
the
fact
that
of
presence
of
brunswick,
is
it
not
possible
to
say
that
damage
is
an
inappropriate
word,
it
has
been
suggested
in
the
briefs
that
the
plaintiffs
below
was
seeking
a
windfall
that
would
result
to
them
as
result
of
the
elimination
of
competition.
is
that
distinction
between
that
sort
of
economic
gain
and
damages
sustained
as
result
of
wrong?
unknown
speaker
mr.
segal.
let
me
put
what
i
understand
that
be
your
opponent’s
strongest
case
against
to
you,
make
sure
you
address
it
directly.
as
i
understand
their
theory,
it
is
that
the
acquisition
was
unlawful
which
you
assume
for
purposes
of
question
one
and
that
therefore
the
presence
in
the
market
was
unlawful
which
he
was….
unknown
speaker
correct,
but
they
say
would
not
be
there
but
for
the
violation
of
law
and
that
therefore
there
is
a
continuing
violation,
they
say
also
that
the
presence
caused
injury
to
them,
even
though
it
may
not
have
caused
any
adverse
impact
on
competition
and
they
then
say
that
the
statute
provide
that
they
can
recover
for
an
injury,
which
flow
injury
to
business
or
property
flowing
from
a
violation
of
law.
your
response
is
as
i
understand
it
is,
no,
you
can
only
recover
for
an
injury,
if
it
is
also
an
injury
which
causes
an
adverse
impact
on
competition.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
support
for
that?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
segal
were
those
cases
in
which
one
could
assume
for
purpose
of
decision,
i
haven’t
read
about,
that
there
was
an
injury
in
fact
but
yet
no
damage
falling
from
injury.
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
sure,
i
made
my
question
this
precise
as
i
should
have,
did
they
assume
in
so
saying
that
there
was
injury
flowing
from
the
violation
even
though
not
flowing
from
a
injury
to
competition?
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
very
narrow,
narrow
question
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
that
there
was
an
injury
in
fact.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
so
now,
in
this
case,
do
i
understand
mr.
segal
that
you
argue
that
you
concede
at
least
arguendo,
that
have
there
been
showing
here
of
sales
below
cost
by
your
the
deep
pocket
client,
at
the
bowling
alleys,
acquired
in
an
issue
in
this
case,
that
that
would
have
laid
the
foundation
for
a
vulnerability
of
monetary
damage.
unknown
speaker
yes
and
so
that,
that
was
the
yes
it
has….
unknown
speaker
was
there
evidence
of
sales
below
cost
here?
unknown
speaker
trip
to
europe
and
so
on.
unknown
speaker
cut
rate
group….
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
evidence
wasn’t
there….
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
there
is
jury’s
verdict
on
section
2
might
have
been
premised
upon
the
proposition
that
there
was
no
intent,
that
they
were
in
fact
sales
below
cost,
but
there
were
no
intent.
unknown
speaker
but
if,
as
i
understand,
you
are
not
going
to
see
that
a
case
for
a
monetary
damages
resulting
from
a
violation
of
section
7,
in
these
circumstances
could
be
based
upon
sales
below
cost,
by
the
bowling
alleys
acquired
by
your
client
than
shouldn’t
the
plaintiff,
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
theory
is
wholly
wrong,
shouldn’t
he
be
entitled
to
prove
that
on
a
new
trial?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
that
is
unfair
competition,
isn’t
it,
that’s
for
sales
below
cost
by
a
monopolist?
unknown
speaker
you
have
got
to
show
it
cut
me
something.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
shouldn’t
the
plaintiffs
be
entitled
on
a
new
trial
even
assuming
you
are
quite
right
about
to
how
erroneous
the
court
of
appeals
was
to
show
sales
below
cost
had
resulting
damages.
unknown
speaker
you
have
seven
minutes
left
including
your
rebuttal,
mr
segal.
unknown
speaker
mr
segal,
would
you
come
and
either
you
can
say
that
for
rebuttal
if
you
want
to
save
the
time,
but
i
would
be
interested
in
your
response
to
their
argument
that
the
failing
company
defense
really
does
not
or
should
not
apply
in
the
vertical
acquisition
situation.
unknown
speaker
well,
again,
let
me
try
and
put
the
question,
a
little
more
forcefully,
because
i
want
to
be
sure,
i
get
your
thinking
on
it.
it
seems
to
that
the
theory
of
the
failing
company
defense
is
that
in
a
horizontal
acquisition,
it
doesn’t
make
much
difference
whether
it
goes
out
of
business
or
its
acquired
by
the
competitor,
because
you
end
up
for
the
same
kind
of
market,
but
in
the
vertical
acquisition
case,
you
have
really
kind
of
a
different
theory
in
the
proctor
and
gamble
case,
in
the
law,
that’s
a
deep
pocket
getting
into
a
market,
and
presumably
changing
things
that
would
otherwise
exist.
now,
one
may
question
that
wasn’t
in
the
proctor
and
gamble
but
it
is
part
of
the
law.
now,
how
does
that
theory
of
the
failing
company
defense
fit,
when
the
vice
is
adding
a
deep
pocket
competitor
to
the
market
that
wouldn’t
otherwise
be
there….
unknown
speaker
i
know
the
act
does,
but
does
the
failing
company
defense,
is
the
theory
that
the
failing
company
defense
fits
here
as
said....
unknown
speaker
may
i
suggest
you,
why
don’t
you
talk
in
on
the
microphone.
unknown
speaker
just
so,
i
understand
what
your
position
is.
suppose
that
the
court
of
appeal
had
expressly
said
or
suppose
we
read
the
record
as
indicating
of
this,
that
there
was
a
violation
here
in
the
sense
of
the
--
there
might
be
a
lessening
of
competition
in
the
future
or
tendency
to
create
a
monopoly,
but
the
record
is
barren
of
any
actual
impact
on
competition
but
nevertheless
there
is
violation
of
section
7.
but
and
the
court
of
appeals
says,”
nevertheless
damages
is
recoverable
from
the
mere
fact
of
the
violation.”
now
what
is
your
position
on
that?
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
damages..
unknown
speaker
you
know
any
cases
that
would
support
the
recovery
of
damages
on
the
premise
that
you
can
recover
damages
just
from
the
violation
itself
without
any
proof
of
decrease
of
competition.
unknown
speaker
it
depends
on
--
if
then
just
the
bank
and
not
a
manufacturer.
unknown
speaker
but
if
was
just
a
bank,
and
not
a
manufacturer,
but
there
will
be
something
illegal
about
there
foreclosing.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hoffman,
along
that
line,
let’s
assume
for
the
moment
that
instead
of
brunswick
corporation
acquiring
the
bowling
centers,
they
have
been
acquired
by
another
great
national
corporation,
you
name
it
general
motors
or
ibm,
that
had
even
deeper
pocket
and
make
all
of
the
other
factual
assumptions,
that
you
make
in
this
case,
would
you
see
any
distinction?
unknown
speaker
if
one
of
these
other
giants
acquired
these
centers?
if
it
said
they
have
financial
resources
to
do
the
things
that
you
feel
that
brunswick
has
done
or
will,
would
it
not
--
what
difference
would
it
make?
unknown
speaker
when
i
am
leading
after
meek,
mr.
hoffman,
isn’t
your
complaint
really
that,
this
is
a
conglomerate
type
merger
not
a
vertical
merger
in
the
normal
sense.
the
part
is
normally,
in
a
vertical
merger,
are
they
competitors
of
the
acquiring
company
that
dries
up
customers,
but
here
what’s
the
other
company
in
this….
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
other
company
in
this
business,
ams
is
not
complaining.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
hoffman,
my
problem
is
by
taking
over
and
letting
--
suppose
brunswick
had
just
said
we
will
forgive
the
debt
which
you
suggest
let
thme
keep
on
running?
unknown
speaker
did
they
have
any
complain?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
go
back
to
your
original
answer
you
wouldn’t,
you
wouldn’t
have
entitled,
you
wouldn’t
have
either
two
or
seven
violations
would
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
it
just
--
exactly
what
was
the
difference?
the
same
bowling
alley
would
run
right?
unknown
speaker
now,
it’s
running
solely,
because
your,
complain
is
brunswick
is
running
and
what’s
the
difference,
what
happened
when
brunswick
took
it
almost?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hoffman,
i
am
just
trying
to
recall
the
briefs,
does
the
record
shows
that
these
were
actual
losses,
or
are
these
computed
losses
based
on
the
assumptions
that
they
have
paid
actually?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn’t
make
assumption
as
to
paying
interest
that
independents
had
to
pay
or
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
mr
hoffman,
suppose
that
a
brunswick
could
come
into
a
market
and
made
a
vertical
acquisition
of
a
perfectly
healthy
bowling
center,
they
just
decided,
they
get
in
to
the
retail
market
and
suppose
one
of
these
centers
was
that
kind
of
a
center
--obviously
i
am
moving
you
towards
the
second
point
in
the
case.
but
isn’t
it
critical
to
your
case
in
proving
your
damages
that
these
centers
were
not
healthy
centers?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that….
unknown
speaker
but
suppose,
in
my
example,
the
brunswick
acquires
a
perfectly
healthy
bowling
center
and
the
business
figures
remain
exactly
the
same
for
all
of
the
centers
in
the
city
for
five
years.
now,
you
would
have
--
but
it
might
very
well
be
that,
that
the
court
might
find
the
acquisition
to
be
a
violation
of
the
section
7
but
how
about
your
action
for
damages?
unknown
speaker
so,
it
is,
it
is
…..
unknown
speaker
so,
it
is
important
that
you
prove
something
more
than
a
violation
to
recover
damages.
unknown
speaker
which
is
true
of
any
anti-trust,
you
have
to
prove
your
damages,
you
have
to
show
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hoffman,
let
me
interrupt
you
just
once
more
because
i
want
to
sure,
i
understand
your
theory.
as
i
understand,
none
of
the
plaintiffs
actually
went
out
of
business.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
is
the
legal
significance
of
the
facts
set
forth
in
this
appendix,
namely
as
you
contend
that
the
companies
taken
over
by
brunswick
lost
money,
what
difference
does
that
make?
what’
s
this,
i
just
find
normal.
unknown
speaker
it
is
just
further
evidence
of
the
fact
that
you
considered
already
as
debt
so
they
would
have
gone
out
of
the
business
instead
of
being
taken
--
that
is
the
only
way...
unknown
speaker
was
there
is
any
evidence
that
the
prices
in
the
market
changed,
i
did
not
think
there
was?
unknown
speaker
you
think
the
price
was
raised
or
lowered
by
reason
of
the
acquisition.
unknown
speaker
so
then
it
is
like
you
started
to
speak
sometime
ago
about
a
clash
of
policies,
is
the
clash
on
the
one
hand
in
the
public
interest
to
low
prices
and
the
other
policy,
the
policy
to
small
businesses
staying
in
business
or
what
is
the
clash
of
policies?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hoffman,
may
i
ask
this
question
because
the
record
show
the
principal
products
sold
by
brunswick
to
your
clients,
for
example,
as
it
does,
what
are
they?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
depreciable
life
of
the
pinsetting
equipment
and
the
bowling
alley?
unknown
speaker
is
any
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
the
annual
sales
or
other
types
of
equipment
to
plaintiffs
centers.
unknown
speaker
what
percentage
really
of
total
sales
would
that
be
sales
of
brunswick
corporation
to
bowling
centers.
unknown
speaker
if
you
eliminate
the
pinsetters,
it
is
a
small
percentage.
a
very
small
percentage.
unknown
speaker
it’s
quite
unlike
the
typical
radical
integrated
acquisition
where
the
purpose
among
others
is
to
acquire
customers
who
will
be
buying
on
a
regular
basis
from
the
acquiring
corporation.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hoffman,
i
wanted
you
to
see,
your
time
is
up.
why
do
not
you
just
in
a
word
tell
us
your
answer
to
the
dilemma
that
the
bill
you
are
in
under
question
two,
is
to
how
you
cant
have
a
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
under
the
court
of
appeals
remand
that
you
might
lose
on
the
failing
company
document.
unknown
speaker
you
didn’t.
unknown
speaker
are
there
more
proceedings
to
be
held
with
respect
to
whether
there
were
alternatives.
