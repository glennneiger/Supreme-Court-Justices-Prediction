justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
petitioner
is
one
of
the
two
largest
manufacturers
of
bowling
equipment
in
united
states.
and
the
respondents
have
three
bowling
centers
located
in
distinct
markets.
respondents
brought
his
antitrust
action
claiming
that
the
petitioner
accusations
of
competing
bowling
centers
that
had
defaulted
on
payments
owed
to
petitioner
violated
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
the
respondent
sought
damages
for
the
progress
they
would
have
earned
and
petitioner
is
allowed
the
defaulting
centers
to
close.
the
jury
was
instructed
in
the
court
with
this
damage
theory
and
they
returned
the
verdict
for
respondents
which
went
treble
exceeded
six
million
dollars.
the
court
of
appeals
while
finding
certain
instructional
errors
that
require
a
new
trial
indulged
the
damage
theory
on
which
respondent's
case
was
based.
specifically
it
held
convincible
any
laws
“casually
linked
to
the
mere
presence
of
violators
in
the
market.”
by
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
to
recover
damages
in
an
antitrust
action,
plaintiff
must
prove
injury
that
reflects
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
either
the
violation
or
anticompetitive
acts
made
possible
by
the
violation
to
allow
all
casually
linked
losses
to
be
compensated,
we
conclude,
with
divorce
antitrust
recovery
from
the
purposes
of
the
antitrust
laws.
as
in
a
clear
statutory
command,
we
are
unprepared
to
do
so.
because
the
respondents
did
not
prove
any
compensable
injury
and
they
have
not
offered
any
justification
for
allowing
them
another
opportunity
to
do
so,
we
vacate
the
judgment
at
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
with
instructions
to
enter
a
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
on
the
damage
claim.
on
remand,
the
respondents
were
remained
free
to
seek
equitable
relief.
