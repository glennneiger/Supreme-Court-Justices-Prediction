justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hoffman,
in
your
view,
could
brunswick
without
actually
foreclosing
but
continuing
to
being
a
larger
and
larger
partner
of
a
particular
alley
and
perhaps
acquiring
more
and
more
dominance
over
its
policy?
could
your
client
eventually,
if
it
had
a
cause
of
action
against
it,
even
though
what
happens
formally
taken
over
title
to
the
place?
