mr.
bernard
g.
segal
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
rise
to
address
the
court
in
a
case
which
has
aptly
been
called
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the
case
of
first
impression
nationally,
one
which
explores
largely
virgin
antitrust
territory
and
one
which
involves
for
the
first
time,
since
the
clayton
act
was
passed,
that
we
have
a
money
damage
verdict
under
that
act.
i
should
like
to
emphasize
initially
that
what
we
are
here
for
is
to
argue
legal
issues,
not
facts.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that
we
are
here
to
argue
the
subject
of
damages
has
governed
by
those
legal
issues.
there
are
just
a
few
uncontroverted
facts
say,
in
facts,
i
think
are
necessary
just
as
background
whereas
the
plaintiffs
are
subsidiaries
of
treadway
companies
which
is
a
chain
of
bowling
centers
that
operates
in
the
united
states
and
each
subsidiary
operates
a
different
bowling
center.
brunswick
corporation
is
one
of
two
largest
manufacturers
and
distributors
of
bowling
equipment
in
the
united
states
and
it
is
the
defendant,
the
petitioner
here.
i
should
say
your
honor
that
the
reason
the
litigation
arouse
is
that
prior
to
1964,
the
bowling
industry,
really
prior
to
the
early
1960s
was
in
the
boom
period
and
the
bottom
fell
out
of
it.
in
around
1963,
1964
there
was
a
precipitous
decline
and
the
petitioner
found
itself
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy.
it
had
borrow
$300
million
because
in
selling
to
the
bowling
centers,
the
plaintiffs
here,
is
that
on
conditional
sales
with
a
down
payment
but
with
a
very
substantial
portion
of
it,
major
portion
of
the
money
being
on
a
note
basis
and
it
had
$400
million
outstanding
with
these
bowling
centers
of
which
a
hundred
million
dollars
was
more
than
90
days
delinquent.
what
it
needed
was
someway
to
get
cash
flow.
it
appraised
all
of
these
centers.
it
selected
those
which
it
thought
would
give
it
cash
flow.
it
first
tried
to
get
them
to
pay
and
then
tried
to
dispose
all
of
them,
dispose
of
the
equipment
as
the
court
of
appeals
carefully
outlines
failing
roll
back,
it
took
over
these
stations
to
operate
them
where
it
thought
they
would
create
a
cash
flow
and
what
we
have
involved
here
are
three
local
markets
in
which
it
took
over
stations.
two
of
them,
it
took
over
station
that
was
one
of
the
smaller
bowling
stations,
one
of
them
it
found
that
bowling
centers,
i
should
say
your
honors,
it
found
that
it
simply
couldn’t
get
the
cash
flow
and
after
few
years
it
just
closed
it
down
and
left
the
market,
that
was
poughkeepsie.
the
others
that
remained
in
the
market,
the
complaint
of
the
plaintiffs
is
that
it
should
not
have
taken
over
those
stations,
that
if
it
had
not
done
so,
those
stations,
i
calling
them
stations
those
bowling
centers
would
have
folded
and
let
me
tell
you,
your
honor,
i
don’t
do
much
bowling.
those
bowling
centers
would
have
folded
and
if
they
had
folded
the
plaintiffs
would
have
shared
with
the
other
centers
in
each
of
these
three
local
markets
with
a
business
that
would
thus
have
been
released.
that
is
the
entire
theory
of
the
case.
your
honor
is
there
just
for
some
reason
or
i
guess,
i
know
the
reason,
the
respondents
endeavored
to
change
that
theory
here
and
i
therefore
read
your
honor,
just
what
the
court
of
appeal
said,
it
happens
to
be
at
page
25(a)
of
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari,
the
thrust
of
plaintiff
section
fourth
theory
was
that
damages
were
to
be
computed
by
first
assuming
that
each
brunswick
acquired
center
would
have
closed
down
at
the
moment
of
takeover.
in
other
words,
no
one
else
could
have
taken
over.
they
were
just
closed
down.
but
for
the
takeover
and
then
by
projecting
what
portion
of
the
closed
centers
business
would
have
been
captured
by
treadway
centers.
now,
i
should
say
to
your
honor,
that
in
these
three
markets
there
is
no
showing
of
any
kind
that
the
plaintiffs
had
any
less
share
of
the
business
or
that
the
defendant
got
any
more
share
of
the
business
during
the
eight
years
from
the
time
of
takeover
until
the
time
of
the
second
trial.
there
is
no
showing
that
there
was
any
difference
in
facilities.
indeed
the
only
showing
was
that
three
of
the
independent
centers
increased
their
facilities.
no
showing
except
that
the
defendant
gave
up
completely
the
poughkeepsie
market,
gave
up
one
of
its
bowling
centers
in
the
paramus
market.
the
three
markets
are
paramus
in
new
jersey,
poughkeepsie
in
new
york
and
pueblo
in
colorado.
i
say,
there
is
no
showing
of
any
of
those
because
the
case
proceeded
on
the
rather
simple
ground.
now
at
the
trial
there
were
two,
they
were
charged
of
the
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
and
the
plaintiff
withdrew
that.
there
was
a
charge
of
the
violation
of
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
and
this
is
important
because
that
the
judge
in
charging
the
jury
took
up
every
bit
of
evidence
of
what
was
called
behavioral
evidence
that
the
plaintiffs
offered
every
shred
of
it,
and
gave
it
to
the
jury
and
said
this
is
for
the
section
2
sherman
act
charge
and
if
you
find
these
things
are
true,
then
you
give
a
verdict
to
the
defendant,
to
the
plaintiffs
and
the
jury
brought
in
a
verdict
for
the
defendant
on
the
section
2,
sherman
act.
now,
when
it
came
to
the
clayton
act,
section
7,
there
the
charge
the
court
restrict
of
its
charge
to
a
structural
charge.
he
said
the
defendant
admits
that
it's
number
one
in
bowling.
it's
a
largest
manufacturer
in
bowling
and
it
serves
as
a
banker
for
those
to
whom
it
sales
and
finally
the
court
said
that
the
percentage
of
bowling
center
facilities
in
a
local
market
that
brunswick
obtained
by
the
mere
act
of
taking
over
a
bowling
center,
you
find
that
that
was
more
than
insubstantial
share,
were
the
trial
court’s
words,
if
you
find
that
was
more
than
an
insubstantial
share,
say
beyond
ten
percent
or
fifteen
percent,
then
you
may
find
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiffs.
now,
that
was
the
only
thing
that
was
--
that’s
before
this
court,
the
only
thing
on
question
one,
the
only
thing
that
was
given
to
the
jury.
when
everything
else
had
found
for
the
defendant,
my
friend
on
the
other
side
has
some
30
pages
of
facts.
he
talks
of
findings
by
the
jury
or
i
can’t
understand
if
they
were
finding,
they
were
for
the
defendants.
but
since
this
is
a
law
case,
your
honor;
i
don’t
argue
anything
of
the
facts.
i
have
read
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
general
verdict
for
the
defendant
in
section
2
sherman
act
and
the
verdict
of
something
under
$
7
million
dollars
after
trebling
under
the
clayton
act.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
none
whatever
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
there
was
your
honor..
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
there
was
a
general
prayer
for
equitable
relief.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
he
curiously
relied
on
the
jury’s
verdict.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
he
gave
he
granted
the
divestiture,
and
the
court
of
appeals...
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
would
say
no
your
honor
because
says
the
court
of
appeals
that
one
of
his
errors
was
that
he
relied
primarily
on
what
he
regarded
as
the
findings
of
the
jury
and
the
findings
of
jury
could
only
be
in
section
two
and
section
two
was
decided
for
the
defendants.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
he
said
a
lot
of
things
about
the
facts;
he
said
a
lot
of
things
about
the
facts.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that’s
was
one
of
the
reason
he
was
reversed
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
but
we
aren’t
here
on
that
your
honor.
your
honors
had
two
petitions,
one
consisted
of
two
solid
pages
of
questions.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
am
willing
to
assume
for
the
purposes
of
argument
and
to
precede
that
there
was
a
violation.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
take
up
from
that
point
now,
it
so,
happens….
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
make
that
assumption.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
second
question
your
honor,
we
say
that
can
not
be
liability
because
of
the
failing
company,
i
am
now
addressing
myself
the
question
one.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
now,
my
friend
objects
to
the
fact
that
in
making
our
concession
since
the
court
had
said
that
there
was
enough
for
the
jury
to
find
violation
of
sending
it
back
for
that,
we
assume
to
that
my
friend
seems
to
think
that
that
makes
a
mighty
difference
and
opens
up
the
whole
question
and
therefore
my
direct
answer
is
the
answer
i
gave
mr.
justice
white
that
we
are
perfectly
willing
to
assume
for
purposes
of
argument.
in
this
case
that
the
acquisition,
by
the
defendant,
the
acquisitions
constituted
of
violation
of
section
7,
for
the
purposes
of
first
...
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no,
that
i
should
make
clear
right
now,
to
you,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
the
entire
damage
theory,
the
entire
damage
theory
in
this
case
as
said
by
the
court
of
appeals
succinctly
had
a
single
line
of
damages.
there
were
five
witnesses,
indeed
their
testimony
was
so
identical
that
the
trial
judge
charged,
if
you
believe
one
you
must
believe
all
five,
which
is
a
curious
charge
but
they
really
were
identical
and
the
jury
took
without
a
dollar
change
what
they
said
was
minimum
loss
of
what.
what
the
plaintiffs
would
have
had
if
instead
of
taking
over
the
station,
patience
they
have
given
up
the
station.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
bowling,
yes
that’s
my
next
case
your
honor,
that
proves,
i
prepare
in
advance
anyway.
the
sole
evidence
in
this
case,
is
what
i
have
just
said.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
mr.
justice
rehnquist
the
whole
things
is
a
about
4.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that’s
what
we
here
for.
the
court
held
that
mere
presence,
mere
presence
without
any
lessening
little
own
substantial
lessening
of
competition
would
be
enough.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
mere
presence
was
the
violation.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
some
additional
proof
about
lessening
of
competition.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes
your
honor
in
this
case.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
in
this
case,
the
whole
of
the
plaintiff
is
premised
on
the
fact
that
the
bowling
centers
would
have
gone
out
of
business,
if
we
had
not
taken
them
over
and
therefore,
if
we
had
not
taken
over
the
business
would
have
been
distributed.
in
another
words,
what
he
is
complaining
about
your
honors
is
the
maintenance
of
the
competition,
not
the
destruction
of
competition.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
precisely,
your
honor
we
take
the
position
and
there
is
every
case
one
reads
is
consonant
with
this
position,
that,
damage
has
to
be
something
which
under
this
act,
flows
from
either
a
reduction
in
competition
or
a
creation
of
monopoly
and
that
is
here
is
called
damage
is
just
the
result
of
ordinary
competition.
if
any
other
--
if
the
original
people
had
stood
there,
the
original
operators
would
have
had
the
same
picture,
if
we
had
forgiven
the
debts,
which
here
for
the
first
time
my
friend
says
we
could
have
done,
if
we
have
said,
all
right
you
can
owe
us
$400
million,
we
wont
collect,
they
would
have
had
the
same
presence
as
they
have
now,
they
would
have
had
the
same
business
because
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence,
no
showing,
that
we
got
any
more
business
after
we
came
than
our
predecessors
had.
there
is
no
showing
we
got
any
more
business
than
anyone
else
would
have
had,
and
the
only
increases
in
facilities
are
by
others
not
by
us,
we
have
closed
down.
we
have
not
increased,
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence,
i
say,
without
any
question
whatever,
no
showing
of
any
kind
that
we
gained
anything.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
may
i
interrupt
your
honor?
the
presence
not
of
brunswick,
the
presence
of
the
station.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
correct.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
the
support
for
that,
well,
this
court
has
never
had
a
case
involving
damages
but
it's
pronouncements
in
the
non-damage
in
the
government,
in
the
equity
cases
have
been
used
by
cases
like
gottesman
in
the
second
circuit
where
they
have
now,
said
and
pretty
uniformly,
originally
there
was
a
big
split
that
you
can’t
recover,
all
of
them
say
however
that
the
only
thing
you
can
recover
and
i
say
with
hesitancy
whatever
that
there
is
not
a
case
that
doesn’t
say
this,
that
the
only
thing
you
can
recover
that
for
is
damages
flowing
from
either
the
lessening
of
competition
or
the
creation
of
monopoly,
that
when
the
threat
ripens
into
reality
and
you
can
prove
that
flowing
out
of
the
reality
is
a
damage
to
you,
than
you
can
recover
and
that
is
the
only
place
you
can
recover
the
difference,
mr.
justice
powell
that
you
have
made
is
precisely
of
difference
that
the
case
has
made.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
that
was
the
ultimate
holding
because
this
is
the
first
case
of
a
money
damage.
in
each
case,
when
it
came
back,
the
court
said,
oh,
you
are
just
saying
you
are
injured
by
the
competition,
you
are
not
proving
that
you
are
injured
by
lessening
of
competition
or
by
creation
of
monopoly
so,
though
we
have
said
the
rule
is
you
can
recover,
you
have
not
proved
anymore
than
has
been
proved
here,
you
have
not
given
us
the
pre-requisite
for
a
damaged
verdict,
namely
damage
flowing
from
a
lessening
of
competition
which
are
argues
for
both
terms.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
can’t
say
that
expressing
by..
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
in
every
case
your
honor
you
had
that
as
a
fact.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
or
whenever
isn’t?
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that
resulted
in
diminution
of
the
level
of
competition.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
on
our
assumption
there
would
have
be
damages
about,
would
that
be
true?
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no
evidence
of
sale
below
cost,
there
was
30-40
pages.
there
were
things
that
for
instance
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yeah,
now
that
was
trips
of
two
people
for
the
whole
united
states,
we
demonstrated…..
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no,
not
cut
rate
there
was
only
one
charge
of
cut
rate
in
the
record
and
that
was
that
in
order
to
attract
youngsters
in
the
summer,
we
gave
them
a
special
rate
in
mornings
when
youngsters
normally
did
not
play
but
our
total
promotion
cost
was
under
3%
whereas
the
plaintiff’s
total
promotion
cost
was
3%.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh,
yes
there
was
evidence
but
all
that
was
section
2,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
but
of
course,
that
the
court
said
that’s
not
evidence
for
you
on
section
7.
the
court
said
you,
you
must
find
these
three
propositions,
it’s
three
that
i
had
outlined
to
your
honor
and
that’s
said
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
is
categorically
the
case
that’s
one
reached
the
charge
of
the
jury.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
provided
that
the
sales
below
cost
have
resulted
in
what
there
is
no
showing
of
here.
a
lessening
of
competition.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
our
sales
below
cost
may
get
me
no
business
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
sales
below
cost
will
show
the
violation
but
not
the
damage….
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
right,
but
in
this
case,
and
i
emphasize
this
once,
before
i
leave,
there
is
not
a
shred
of
effort
by
any
of
the
five
witnesses
on
damages,
to
show
that
there
was
any
damage
from
predatory
conduct,
the
plaintiffs
decided
that
the
place
where
they
could
get
real
money
here
was,
millions
of
dollars,
if
they
could
have
established
because
the
centers
were
continued
in
operation
instead
of
close,
they
were
entitled
to
what
they
lost,
that’s
what
the
gambled
on
and
i
would
stake
whatever
reputation
i
might
have
that
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence
of
damage
on
any
of
a
point
in
this
case.
now,
your
honor,
i
think,
i
have
said
enough
about
question
1,
as
my
time
runs
on,
and
i
will
talk
therefore
about
question
2.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
then
i
would
be
very
brief,
because
i
would
like
a
little
time
for
rebuttal.
the
simple
question
here
is,
obviously
the
law
is
that
if
what
the
defendant
took
over
in
each
case
was
a
failing
company
project,
then
the
violation
of
the
anti-trust
law
does
not
exist,
whether
it’s
section
2
or
section
7.
we
proceeded
on
the
postulate
that
since
the
entire
theory
of
the
plaintiffs
was
that
if
we
hadn’t
taken
over,
the
centers
would
have
had
a
fold,
they
would
have
had
to
go
out
of
existence,
--
i
will
just
quote
the
testimony
of
their
witnesses
on
damages.
one
of
them
said,
he
was
asked,
“what
was
the
assumption
on
which
he
gave
these
figures,
which
the
jury
adopted
without
change?”
he
said,
“well,
that
centers
would
have
fallen
would
have
fallen
of
their
own
economic
weight,
if
brunswick
didn’t
prop
them
up”.
and
i
read
from
the
brief
of
the
respondents
in
the
court
of
appeals,
he
said
that
these
centers
were
marginal
and
sub-marginal
bowling
centers
that
would
otherwise
have
folded,
if
it
weren’t
for
what
we
put
into
them”
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh,
your
honors,
on
that
they
are
just
that
wrong.
i
will
say
to
your
honors
that
they
cite
the
us
steel
case,
and
your
honor
yes,
and
in
that
case,
it
was
sent
back
for
the
sole
purpose
of
whether
the
fact
substantiated
the
failing
company
doctrine
and
that
was
vertical.
in
the
cases
that
have
been
with
brown
shoe,
brown
shoe
gave
to
the
entire
congressional
debate,
to
show
that
the
amendments
of
1950
were
intended
to
apply
to
vertical
companies.
and
i
say
to
your
honors,
here
again,
there
isn’t
a
case
that
denies
it
in
a
vertical
…
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
your
honor,
again
the
question
is
deep
pocket
may
be
a
violation,
it
may
be
that
in
a
government
suited
can
be
injoint,
it
maybe
that
it
can
be
divested,
but
the
act
is
categorically
specific
in
applying
to
vertical
as
the
brown
shoe
shows….
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
both
those
cases
apply
it,
the
debate
is
on
the
failing
company
in
both
of
them,
and
they
make
it
categorically
so
and
i
think
that’s
so
because
whether
it
is
vertical
or
not,
the
theory
is
that
they
don’t
want
a
company
which
would
disappear
from
the
market
to
disappear
and
if
the
only
alternative
is
for
‘x’
to
take
it
over.
congress
has
decided
as
a
matter
of
anti-trust
policy,
that
it
prefers
to
have
that
entity
remained
in
the
market,
rather
than
to
have
it
disappear
and
therefore
it
says,
if
it’s
a
failing
company,
you
can
take
it
over.
now,
the
only
issue
here
was,
not
whether
it
would
apply
actually,
the
issue
was
had
we
proved
it?
and
very
simply,
this
is
our
belief.
that
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
theory
on
which
this
case
was
tried,
on
which
the
damages
were
sought,
was
that
if
we
didn’t
take
them
over,
they
would
have
withered
and
died
and
left
the
market.
otherwise
there
is
no
damage
theory
at
all.
both
the
trail
court,
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
it
was
our
affirmative
duty
to
prove
it.
i
say
to
your
honors,
having
now
tried
cases
for
40
years,
that
any
time
i
got
an
admission,
i
never
tried
to
prove
what
was
admitted
by
the
other
party.
and
when
the
admission
is
the
entire
theory,
the
entire
basis,
the
only
way
that
they
can
prevail
at
all
,then
your
honors,
i
wasn’t
--
i
didn’t
try
the
case,
but
i
am
frank
to
say,
if
i
had
been
there,
i
would
have
considered
it
poor
advocacy
to
see
whether
you
could
better
that,
better
the
whole
foundation
stone
of
the
other
side’s
case,
and
i
say
to
your
honors
that
without
the
failing
company
doctrine,
there
is
no
claim
for
damages
here,
and
with
a
failing
company
doctrine,
we
are
entitled
to
judgment,
on
the
matter
of
damages.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no
your
honor.
having
just
two
minutes,
want
to
correct
some
things….
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
want
to
have
the
records
stand
where
i
said
we
were
in
serious
financial
condition
and
my
friend
rises
to
say
no
indeed
things
were
booming
for
us.
i
therefore
read
to
your
honors
just
four
sentences
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
particularly
because
it
is
judge
gibbons
to
whom
my
friend
refers
as
having
indicated
that
things
were
riding
very
high
and
handsome
for
us.
i
read
judge
gibbons.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
page
7(a),
justice
stewart.
over
the
years
brunswick
had
borrowed
close
to
$300
million
in
order
to
finance
the
manufacture
and
sale
of
bowling
equipment.
by
late
1964,
it's
receivables
were
in
excess
of
$400
million,
of
which
more
than
$100
million
were
over
90
days
delinquent.
brunswick
was
clearly
in
serious
financial
difficulty
and
in
effort
to
refers
that
it's
the
theory
of
riding
condition,
brunswick’s
management
decided
on
a
plan
and
it's
back
plan
that
your
honors
have
before
you.
so,
that
as
in
so
much
that
my
friend
has
done,
he
is
simply
not
arguing
this
case
your
honors.
let
me
give
you
another
example.
he
took
your
honors
time
to
say
that
in
cases
like
the
movie
cases,
you
don’t
have
to
be
precise
in
damages.
your
honor,
this
is
the
most
precise
case,
i
have
known
in
my
entire
experience.
five
witnesses
got
up
and
said
here
is
the
minimum,
here
is
the
maximum
and
they
were
identical.
the
jury
took
the
identical
figures
not
a
penny
difference
and
he
argues
to
your
honor,
a
theory
as
to
where
damages
can’t
be.
what
we
have
here,
if
your
honors
please,
is
very
simple.
we
have
a
judge
who
frankly
says,
i
am
venturing
into
new
ground.
in
my
judgment,
he
relished
your
honors
taking
certiorari
on
the
case.
it
rides
throughout
his
opinion
that
he
would
love
to
have
it
determined.
he
has
concluded
that
if
someone
is
there
and
admittedly
as
the
questions
if
your
honors
have
indicated.
if
we
had
forborne,
there
wouldn’t
be
a
change
in
the
market.
there
is
not
a
showing
by
anybody
that
the
market
situation
has
changed,
that
anybody
has
a
greater
share
than
before.
that
anybody
has
more
equipment
other
than
three
independents
who
put
in
a
little
more
equipment.
what
we
have
here
is
a
judge
who
has
concluded
that
in
this
limited
area
of
liability
namely,
section
7,
where
we
are
breaking
new
ground.
if
you
are
don’t
deliver
what
section
7
says,
namely
a
lessening
of
competition,
you
nevertheless
can
have
damages.
now,
one
of
your
honors
has
asked,
are
there
any
cases
and
i
say
this
again
categorically,
every
case
i
have
read
and
we
have
given
the
quotations
in
our
brief,
that
has
pronounced
the
new
theory
that
you
can
have
damages
under
section
7
says,
only
if
you
can
demonstrate
the
damage
flows
from
a
lessening
of
competition
or
a
creation
of
monopoly.
on
the
second
point
your
honor,
i
think
i
have
said
enough.
the
sole
question
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
against
this
on
the
failing
company
doctrine
is
that
it
was
our
obligation
affirmatively
approved.
i
have
leave
your
honors
with
a
thought,
that
if
anything
has
been
demonstrated
this
morning
by
friend’s
own
argument,
it
is
that
these
were
failing
companies.
why
would
we
adduce
proof?
when
it
ran
throughout
the
case
where
the
case
was
rampant,
where
the
whole
theory
of
the
case
was.
that
if
we
hadn’t
taken
over
thy
would
have
failed.
no,
no
one
else
would
have
taken
over,
no
one
would.
why
did
we,
why
were
we
willing
to
operate
some
of
(inaudible),
because
we
needed
cash
flow.
we
would
had
been
bankrupt
if
we
didn’t
get
cash
flow.
we
needed
money
dollars
not
profits.
we
didn’t
worry
about
depreciation
which
caused
losses.
we
needed
cash
flow
and
the
record
shows
the
cash
flow
for
every
center.
i
thank
you,
your
honors.
