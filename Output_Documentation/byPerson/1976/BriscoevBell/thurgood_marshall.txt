justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
in
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
petitioners,
the
governor
and
the
secretary
of
state
of
texas
brought
this
action
in
the
district
court
seeking
to
prevent
respondents,
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
and
the
director
of
the
census
from
making
official
determination
that
texas
was
a
jurisdiction
covered
by
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
as
amended
in
1975
to
cover
discrimination
against
language
minority
groups.
petitioner's
basic
claim
was
that
the
federal
officials
had
misinterpreted
section
4
of
the
act
and
deciding
that
texas
was
covered.
respondent
opposed
these
claims
on
the
merits
and
also
argued
in
the
district
court
that
the
administrative
coverage
decision
was
completely
unreviewable
in
any
court.
the
district
court
found
that
it
had
very
limited
jurisdiction
to
ensure
that
respondents
had
correctly
interpreted
the
statute
and
ruled
against
petitioners
on
all
of
their
statutory
claims.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
both
the
jurisdictional
subsequent
rulings.
we
find
that
the
courts
below
lacks
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
we
hold
that
when
congress
said
in
section
4
of
the
voting
rights
act
that
the
administrative
determinations
"shall
not
be
reviewable
in
any
court",
it
meant
exactly
that.
accordingly,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
order
dismissal
of
petitioner's
complaint.
mr.
justice
powell
concurs
in
the
judgment.
