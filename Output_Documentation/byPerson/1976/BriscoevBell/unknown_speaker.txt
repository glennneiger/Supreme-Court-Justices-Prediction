unknown
speaker
we
have
thought
they
came
to
hear
us
but...
unknown
speaker
or
it
is
the
face
of
the
statute
does
say
that
those
determinations
and
certifications
by
the
attorney
general
and
by
the
director
of
census
are
un-revealable
at
in
any
court.
as
i
understand
that
you
are
not
saying
that?s
not
constitutional.
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
authority
for
thinking
that
the
courts
have
that
sort
of
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
you
are
relying
on
the
same
cases
as
the
government
relied
out
in
its
argument
and
it
was
that
really?
unknown
speaker
i
noticed,
it
was
not
cited
in
the
brief.
unknown
speaker
whether
it
is
worth
the
doctrine
of
legislative
acquiescence
cuts
a
little
bit
the
other
way,
doesn?t
it?
unknown
speaker
the
committee
very
easily,
could
have
used
the
same
language
and
then
in
its
reports
might
have
said,
we
really
mean
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
would
you
apply
4(d)
to
4(b)?
4(b)
just
says,
you
make
some
calculations
and
that
is
the
end
of
it.
unknown
speaker
now,
where
is
that?
alright,
i
got
kept
that,
?maintained
on
november
1,
1964
any
?test
or
device?,
it
says
any
?test
or
device?
with
respect
to
which?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
they
should
have
given
consideration,
does
that
mean
anything
more
than
in
their
internal
deliberations
they
should
have
maybe
considered
this
and
perhaps
rejected
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
can
you
be
certain
that
at
sometime
or
other
the
attorney
general
or
the
civil
rights
division,
or
somebody
has
not
at
least
given
some
thought
to
this
suggestion
risen
and
rejected
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
but?
unknown
speaker
is
not
the
immigration
department
right
in
the
department
of
justice?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
get
the
figures
right
there,
is
not
it?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
assume
that
department
did
not
have
those
figures?
unknown
speaker
they
did
not
have
the
immigration
figures?
unknown
speaker
they
did
not
say,
they
did
not
have
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
not
that
be
a
washout
anyway,
the
figures,
who
cancel
themselves
out,
if
you
had
--
let
us
even
assume
you
had
five
million
illegal
aliens
in
texas
and
that
were
added
to
the
total
of
the
persons
of
voting
age
in
texas,
then
the
next
step
would
be
to
subtract
that
five
million,
in
order
to
give
you
a
what
is
called
a
softer
hand
or
not,
result
of
citizens
of
voting
age
in
texas,
eligible
to
vote.
whatever
the
figure
was,
it
would
cancel
itself
right
out,
why
it
is
ten
million?
unknown
speaker
isn?t
that
correct
as
a
matter
of
fourth-grade
arithmetic.
unknown
speaker
you
get
a
gross
total
and
that
includes
the
illegal
aliens
and
let
us
assume
that
is
?x?
and
then
the
next
thing
you
do
is
subtract
?x?
and
it
does
not
make
any
difference,
what
?x?
is,
it
is
going
to
be
washed
right
off.
unknown
speaker
i
have
a
great
difficulty
in
how
illegal
aliens
come
in
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
well,
how
did
they
get
on
the
census
there?
unknown
speaker
now
you
can
come
forth
and
not
say
anything?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
that
provision
barring
review
and
--
was
it
4
(b)
or...
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean
that
if
the
attorney
general
objects
based
on
this
data
and
texas
should
file
a
suit
in
the
three-judge
district
court,
in
the
district
of
columbia
that
the
figures
would
not
be
open
to
challenge
there
either
or
does
that
just
mean
that
they
can
not
challenge
the
administrative
determination?
unknown
speaker
it
says,
in
any
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
they
bound
by
the
attorney
general?s
determinations,
that
they
do
have
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
would
certainly
say
that
in
the
district
of
columbia,
three-judge
court,
the
provision
of
4(d)
could
be
open.
unknown
speaker
4(d)
says,
if
the
incidence
of
such
use
has
been
few
in
number,
has
been
properly
and
effectively
collected.
unknown
speaker
in
fact
such
has
then
been
eliminated.
unknown
speaker
but
the
state
is
bound
by
the
finding
that
they
have
been
using
a
test
and
device,
when
they
go
into
the
three-judge
district
court.
unknown
speaker
before
you
go
on,
maybe
you
have
already
answered
this,
so
i
missed
it
on
the
page
5(a)
of
the
appendix
to
your
response
on
opposition.
the
very
last
sentence
on
page
5(a)
under
little
three
there,
with
respect
to
section
4(b)
the
term
?test
or
device?
has
defined
in
this
subsection,
which
is
the
foreign
language
subsection,
shall
be
employed
only
in
making
the
determinations
under
the
third
sentence
of
that
subsection.
which
is
a
third
sentence
and
what
does
that
mean?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
which
is
the
third
sentence?
unknown
speaker
so
i
think,
so
the
texas
said,
well
they
made
these
calculations
but
the
census
bureau
said,
well,
we
have
read
the
statute,
but
we
think
it
should
just
be
25%
instead
of
50%.
unknown
speaker
reviewable.
unknown
speaker
why
does
the
government
concede
as
much
as
it
does
in
the
light
of
that
expressed
preclusion
provision.
unknown
speaker
just
to
make
sure,
i
understand,
if
the
next
time
the
attorney
general
turns
down
any
submission,
the
texas
makes
to
it
--
if
texas
then
went
into
the
three-judge
court,
it
could
have
the
determinations
made
under
4(d)
and
it
would
go
right
back
to
whether
or
not,
the
texas
was
legitimately
brought
under
the
act?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
us
assume
that
texas
makes
a
change
in
its
voting
procedures
and
it
is
not
a
about
a
?test
or
device?
at
all,
it
is
some
thing
brand
new,
it
is
never
been
used
before.
unknown
speaker
alright,
and
then
the
attorney
general
turns
it
down.
unknown
speaker
he
objects
to
it.
unknown
speaker
alright,
but
then
texas
goes
into
the
three-judge
court
saying
the
attorney
general
is
dead
wrong.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
it
may
be
completely
--
but
they
have
never
used
the
?test
or
device?
because
it
has
never
been
in
effect,
the
one
the
attorney
general
turns
it
down.
so
how
does
4(d)
come
into
it.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
mean,
right
now,
texas
could
then
go
back
and
under
4(d)
review
the
--
to
the
extent
4(d)
permits
it,
it
could
review
the
triggering
decisions,
original
triggering
decisions
to
put
texas
under
the
act.
unknown
speaker
well,
to
the
extent
4(d)
permits
it.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
but
texas
can
have
that
determination
made
in
the
three-judge
court.
unknown
speaker
in
fact
it
shows
the
next
time
that
texas
was
turned
down,
if
did
have
that
determination
made
in
a
three-judge
court.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
unknown
speaker
has
texas
ever
gone
in
to
the
three-judge
court
on
the
bailout
suit?
unknown
speaker
the
argument
that
is
making
him
--
about
the
fact
that
it
had
already
cleaned
itself
up
by
the
time
the
amendments
went
into
effect,
that
argument
it
could
not
make
in
bailout
suit.
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
am
still
not
clear.
under
4(d)
could
texas
have
sought
relief
the
day
after
the
attorney
general
decided
that
it
was
under
the
act.
when
is
texas
entitled
to
avail
itself
a
4(d)
relief?
unknown
speaker
but
only
there.
unknown
speaker
a
bailout
suit
only
in?
unknown
speaker
17
years
isn?t
it?
unknown
speaker
but
now,
you
are
conceding,
as
i
understand,
and
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong,
that
the
determination
or
a
certification
of
the
attorney
general,
that
is
referred
to
on
page
4(a)
of
the
respondents,
your
brief
in
opposition,
is
subject
to
limited
review
in
something
other
than
a
bailout
suit,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
government
that
can
--
ever
to
reconcile
its
position
here
with
its
position
on
grossett(ph)
i
think.
unknown
speaker
your
second
alternative
is
certainly
consistent.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
but
clear
your
position
on
the
extended
reviewability,
is
that
errors
of
law
are
not
reviewed.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
do
not
really
need
to
argue
what
is
the
right
construction
of
the
statute
with
respect
to
50%
whether
it
refers
to
voting
age
people
or
whether
it
refers
to
registered
voters.
you
just
could
not
care
less
because
it
is
just
an
error
of
law
or
whatever
it
is,
then
the
attorney
general?s
judgment
about
the
statute
is
final,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
you
just
say
it
does
not
make
any
difference
whether
it
is
wrong
or
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
generally,
i
know
i
am
not,
--
i
am
asking
you
that
question.
unknown
speaker
but
you
know
it
could
be
construed
either
way.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
the
issue
of
the
proper
construction
of
that
statute
is
just
not
open,
in
any
review
suit.
your
position
is
that
no
court
has
any
business
giving
a
judgment
as
to
what
the
proper
construction
of
that
statute
is.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no,
no,
he
says,
look
i
am
applying
the
statute,
here
is
my
construction
of
the
language
and
as
long
as
he
says
that
and
goes
that
route,
is
not
that
the
end
of
it?
unknown
speaker
50%
or
something.
unknown
speaker
then
it
is
not
a
reviewable.
if
we
use
25%,
you
would
say
it
would
be.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
limitation
if
any
is
there
against
bringing
a
bailout
suit?
unknown
speaker
but,
it
had
to
be
brought
under
district
of
columbia.
unknown
speaker
how
about
your
limited
review
that
you
are
talking
about
under
4(d),
where
they
started
out
here
with
a
single
judge
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
any
reason
why
that
has
to
be
brought
in
the
district
of
columbia?
unknown
speaker
so,
that
is
a
broader
provision
in
the
bail
than
the...
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
how
many
people
do
you
know
the
attorney
general
has
reviewing
submissions
from
the
states
or
from
all
over
the
country?
unknown
speaker
must
be
substantial
if
they
are
20
a
week
from
texas.
unknown
speaker
why,
is
it
another
large
section
that
does
this?
unknown
speaker
since
texas
was
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
enjoin
there
two
other
counties?
unknown
speaker
this
action
was
brought
before
or
after
the
attorney
general
ruled,
effective
to
the
subject
of
the
act.
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
interested
in
how
texas
and
the
united
states
government
can
come
to
issue
on
what
seems
to
be
the
merits
of
this
case,
texas
were
brought
under
the
statute,
by
virtue
of
a
test
or
device
that
was
repealed
by
texas
before
the
statute
became
effective.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
but
it
does
not
maintain
that
test
or
device
now
or
as
of
the
date
the
statute
became
effective
and
if
texas
had
instituted
this
suit
the
day
after
it
received
the
letter
from
the
attorney
general.
i
understand
you
to
say
that
it
could
have
instituted
this
suit
or
another
suit
as
a
bailout
action.
so,
what
you
are
saying
perhaps
is
that
texas
went
to
court
too
soon?
unknown
speaker
but
would
it
been
a
better
remedy
still
for
the
attorney
general
to
have
consider
the
requirements
of
4(d),
so
it
got
so
far
saying
for
purposes
of
this
section
in
the
same
section
with
4(d).
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
wondering
why
it
does
not.
unknown
speaker
can
i
gather,
i
could
do
that
this
afternoon
at
district
of
columbia?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kendall,
that
is
what
a
bailout
suit
is
for.
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
bailout
suit,
we
get
the
benefit
of
4(d).
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
in
the
bailout
suit
you
would
have
the
benefit.
unknown
speaker
a
voting
age.
unknown
speaker
how
many
across
the
border
every
month,
legal
and
the
illegal?
unknown
speaker
what
better
figures
do
you
have?
unknown
speaker
what
better
figures
do
you
have?
unknown
speaker
what
are
those
figures?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
better
figures
do
you
have
for
texas?
unknown
speaker
how
does
that
help
you
or
help
us
now?
