mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
david
m.
kandell,
first
assistant
attorney
general
in
the
state
of
texas,
with
me
this
morning
is
mr.
lonny.
f
zweiner,
an
assistant
attorney
general
and
the
honorable
mark
white,
secretary
of
the
state,
of
the
state
of
texas
whose
has
both,
lawyer
license
to
practice
in
this
court
and
authority
to
this
suit.
despite
the
fact
that
in
testifying
before
the
house
committee
considering
extension
of
the
voting
right
bills,
mr.
stanley
pottinger
who
is
that
time
chief
of
the
civil
rights
division
of
the
justice
department,
testified
that
there
was
no
need
to
extend
the
voting
rights
act
in
1975
to
the
state
of
texas.
the
act
was
amended
and
on
september
18th
of
1975,
the
attorney
general
mr.
levi
and
mr.
bravesi,
the
bureau
of
the
census
issued
a
statement
which
merely
recited
the
other
requirements
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
then
said
that
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
the
census
and
the
attorney
general
had
made
their
determinations
pursuing
to
section
4(d)
and
4(f)(3)
of
the
act
and
under
those
determinations,
texas
statewide
was
now,
covered
by
the
act,
published
on
september
18,1975
and
that
began
the
texas?s
saga
with
the
voting
rights
act.
now,
some
20
months
later
and
many
thousands
of
submissions
later,
we
are
still
submitting
every
change
made
in
several
thousand
voting
elections
agencies
in
the
state,
from
the
state
itself
on
down
to
voter
districts
to
the
attorney
general
for
his
clearance.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
judge
last
night,
mr.
justice
brennan,
last
night
i
looked
at
the
last
three
notices,
we
have
received
from
the
attorney
general
and
they
were
around
18
to
25
a
week
from
the
state
of
texas.
at
this
time,
20
months
later
in
our
brief
we
say
that...
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan,
our
estimate
in
the
brief
is,
it
has
been
5,000
submissions
and
they
are
going
at
the
rate
of
18
to
25
a
week.
out
of
that
vast
number
of
submissions
26
have
been
disapproved
according
to
the
sector
wide
at
this
late
date.
the
petitioners
in
this
suit,
petitioners
in
the
lower
court
were
the
governor
of
the
state
of
texas,
dolph
briscoe
and
secretary
white.
and
it
was
our
complaint
then,
as
it
is
now
that
the
manner
in
which
we
were
brought
under
the
coverage,
denied
us
rights,
were
unfair
and
were
not
consistent
with
the
statute
or
with
the
holdings
of
this
court.
we
have
basically
two
points.
first
of
all,
we
say
that
the
justice
department,
the
attorney
general
has
misconstrued
and
misapplied
the
section
4
of
the
act,
in
his
instructions
to
the
bureau
of
the
census,
that
portion
of
the
act,
that
calls
for
the
determination
as
to
other
fewer
than
50%
of
the
citizens
of
voting
age
were
registered
in
1972
or
whether
fewer
than
50%
of
such
persons
voted
in
the
presidential
election
in
that
year,
also
misconstruing
and
misapplying
section
4(d)
which
advices
what
elements
are
to
be
considered
and
determining
whether
or
not
the
state
has
used
a
tester
device
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
we
also
say
that
we
were
mistreated,
if
you
will,
in
that
the
determinations
of
the
bureau
of
the
census
and
of
the
attorney
general,
that
texas
came
within
the
factual
requirements
of
the
statute
were
made
arbitrarily
without
affording
the
state
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
without
considering
a
very
much
evidence
which
was
available
at
that
time
and
by
which
had
it
been
considered
by
the
census
bureau,
the
determination
would
have
been;
the
texas
was
not
covered.
i
would
like
to
make
it
clear,
at
the
outset,
we
do
not
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
voting
rights
act.
we
recognized
that
that
has
been
determined
in
the
south
carolina
against
katzenbach,
and
we
do
not
raise
those
issues
at
this
time.
under
the
1975
amendments,
i
repeat
if
i
may,
there
were
two
determinations
to
be
made
to
bring
texas
or
any
other
state
within
the
coverage
of
the
act
as
amended.
first
of
all,
the
use
--
determination
by
the
attorney
general
that
in
november
1972,
the
state
or
a
political
subdivision
had
used
a
tester
device
as
newly
defined
by
the
act
to
include
voting
materials
in
english
only,
and
the
second
was
that,
with
respect
to
which
state
or
subdivision
the
director
of
the
census
found
that
fewer
than
or
less
than
50%
of
citizens
of
voting
age
were
registered
on
november
1,
1972
or
that
less
than
50%
--
and
again
the
magic
words,
such
persons
voted
in
the
presidential
election
of
november
1972.
it
was
interesting
to
hear
that
the
solicitor
general
speak
about
in
the
last
argument,
speak
about
the
need
to
determine
the
questions
from
the
face
of
the
statute.
we
sort
of
wish
that
solicitor
general?s
office
would
accord
us
the
same
right,
because
it
is
our
feeling
that
when
one
looks
at
the
face
of
the
statute,
with
which
we
are
concerned,
there
is
no
question
but
that
we
are
correct.
the
united
states
in
making
its
determination
as
to
this
4(b)
requirement
ignores
the
first
language.
they
do
not
even
make
any
determination,
how
many
voters
were
registered.
they
say
that
is
unimportant,
because
they
find
that
fewer
than
50%
of
the
citizens
of
voting
age
voted
and
therefore
coverage
is
brought
in.
we
say
that
the
language,
such
persons
obviously
refers
to
the
words,
citizens
of
voting
age
who
registered
and
that
it
is
given
that
interpretation
without
dispute,
texas
does
not
cover.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
we
are
not
asking
that
be
reviewed.
no
sir,
and
we
are
not
asking
that
they
be
reviewed.
we
filed
this
suit
before
they
--
the
determinations
become
effective
upon
publication
of
that,
and
we
had
--
white
had
made
many
efforts
to
go
before
them
and
to
present
to
them
evidence,
as
to
the
numbers
without
success
and
so
before
they
made
any
determinations,
before
anything
was
published,
we
brought
this
suit,
asking
for
injunctive
relief
and
asking
that
the
district
court
instruct
them,
as
to
what
their
duty
was
in
making
these
determinations.
like
the
dunlop
case,
which
i
heard
yesterday,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
secretary
of
labor
could
rightfully
refuse
to
bring
the
suit,
not
review
of
his
determination
itself
but
the
matter
in
which
it
was
made.
we
feel
that
the
courts
do
have
jurisdiction
to
instruct
the
census
and
the
attorney
general?s
office
as
to
how
they
are
to
go
about
the
process
of
reaching
these
determinations,
which
they
do
not
consider
determinations
at
all.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
say,
just
a
easy
way
out
is,
no
one
has
questioned
the
jurisdiction,
but
we
do
rely,
for
instance,
on
such
cases
as
dunlop
against
bachowski,
the
thermtron
products
and
so
on.
in
thermtron,
for
instance,
where
remand
of
a
removed
case
is
not
reviewable
itself
but
the
court
could
held
--
this
court
held
--
they
could
the
review
the
fact
that
the
district
judge
refused
to
review
before
it.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
in
fact,
i
was
very
happy
to
sit
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
did
not
have
the
dunlop
case
and
heard
them
citing
and
when
read
that
we
found
it
quite
applicable.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
am
sorry.
it
is
not,
but
we
heard
that
in
their
argument.
so
we
say,
we
are
not
asking...
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
our
contention
that,
section
4(b),
sub-section
4(b)
of
the
statute
should
so
construed
that
the
words,
?such
persons?,
refer
to
persons
who
are
citizens
of
voting
age
who
had
registered
in
november
of
1972.
it
is
un-controverted
that
the
census
bureau
made
no
such
determinations.
they
completely
ignored
the
earlier
language
of
the
section
that
they
were
to
find
whether
fewer
than
50%
of
the
citizens
of
voting
age
were
registered.
they
paid
no
attention
to
that.
it
is
also
un-controverted
that
using
justice
department
figures,
there
were
7,600,000
and
some
odd
thousands
citizens
of
voting
age
and
according
to
our
figures
5,200,000
citizens
of
the
state
were
registered.
that
being
so,
way
more
than
50%
of
the
citizens
of
voting
age
were
registered
and
of
such
persons,
those
5,200,000,
i
think,
it
is
some
3,600,000
that
voted
in
1972
election
which
again
is
well
over
50%.
under
our
interpretation,
more
than
50%
were
registered
and
more
than
50%
of
?such
persons?
voted
in
1972
and
texas
is
not
covered
by
the
act.
the
language
of
the
statute
is
clear
and
non
ambiguous,
and
that
was
as
much
admitted
in
the
court
of
appeals
where
judge
makinen(ph)
said
at
the
outside,
appellants
would
seem
to
have
the
better
argument.
it
is
a
rule
of
statutory
construction
that
the
legislative
enactments
be
so
construed
as
to
give
effect
to
all
parts
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
united
states
in
its
brief
at
page
37
says,
?whatever
force
this
contention
referring
to
our
contention
might
have
as
a
purely
textual
argument?,
and
i
do
not
find
it
shocking
that
we
would
insist
that
the
text
of
the
statute
be
followed,
that
is
what
we
ask.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
the
court
please,
mr.
justice
white,
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
that
question
has
ever
been
presented
before.
they
refer
to
in
their
brief,
to
many
statements
by
this
court.
and
i
cannot
argue
with
the
fact
that
this
court?
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
that
is
what
they
say,
and
if
it
is
true
though,
i
do
not
know
that
it
has
ever
been
questioned.
in
congress?.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
it
was
the
practice
at
the
time,
the
act
was
reenacted
and
in
the
congressional
hearings,
if
we
go
to
those,
because
we
say,
there
is
no
need
to
go
to
the
hearings
because
the
statute
is
not
ambiguous.
but
if
we
go
to
the
history,
we
will
find
them
saying,
that
this
language
under
our
construction,
justice
brennan?s
construction,
it
is
unnecessary.
that
was
even
i
think
an
amendment
post
to
take
it
out,
the
language
about
registration,
and
that
was
defeated.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
the
congress
left
the
language.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
yes
it
was.
court
please,
i
do
not
know
what
the
congress
could
have
done
that
it
did
not
do,
if
it
wanted
that
language
give
an
effect.
the
facetious
perhaps
put
a
footnote
to
the
statute
to
say?
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
known
to
the
courts,
we
really
mean
it.
we
have
said
it
before
we
say
it
again;
we
are
saying
it
now,
that
this
is
the
formula.
there
is
no
other
way
to
say,
it
could
not
be
said
any
clearer
than
it
was
said,
and
the
cardinal
rule
of
construction
followed
by
this
court,
as
far
as
i
know
of,
every
other
court
in
our
nation
is,
you
give
full
meaning
to
the
language
of
the
statute.
you
do
not
disregard
any
language,
if
you
can
help
it.
and
yet
to
follow
their
analysis
and
their
interpretation
of
the
statute,
you
must
just
disregard
the
language
requiring
a
finding
that
fewer
than
50%
of
citizens
of
voting
age
were
registered.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
i
am
not
certain,
in
how
it
cuts
in
this
case
where,
they
knew
that
there
efforts
made
to
take
a
language
out,
where
they
knew
that
the
attorney
general?s
office
had
not
been
giving
an
effect
and
yet
congress
reenacted
it.
i
think
they
must
have
intended
--
as
i
said,
i
don?t
know
what
else
they
could
have
done,
or
have
they
intended.
it
has
some
effect.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
need
to
get
into
a
construction
of
the
act
because
it
is
so
important.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
of
course,
the
reports
that
we
have
do
not
reflect
really
what
very
few
members
of
the
congress
felt
about
it,
those
who
voted,
and
we
have
statements
by
few.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
the
court
please,
mr.
justice
stevens,
if
you
do
take
that
position
then
you
disregard
the
language
of
the
first
section,
then
becomes
meaningless,
as
the
justice
department
says.
they
don?t
need
to
make
finding
as
to
how
many
were
registered
because
there
will
always
be
fewer
who
have
voted
than
who
are
registered.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
we
think
that
it
takes
a
stretch.
now,
the
original
act,
as
enacted
in
1965
talked
about
the
language
was,
50%
of
persons
of
voting
age,
and
it
was
amended
in
this,
to
say,
citizens,
and
we
think
the
reference
here
clearly,
is
to
citizens
of
voting
age
who
registered,
such
persons,
50%
of
them,
vote.
we
have
the
same
problem
with
reference
to
section
4(d)
of
the
act,
4(d)
in
section
4,
apply
the
languages,
for
the
purposes
of
this
section,
?no
state
or
political
subdivision
shall
be
determined
or
engaged
in
the
use
of
tests
or
devices
for
the
purposes
or
effect
of
denying
or
britting
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race
or
color,
and
so
on.?
if
incidents
of
such
use
have
been
few
in
number
and
have
been
properly
and
effectively
corrected,
and
other
factors
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
or
not,
a
jurisdiction
uses
tests
or
devices.
the
justice
department
disregards
the
language
that
says
for
the
purposes
of
this
section,
and
says,
if
that
applies
only
to
a
bailout
suit
under
section
4
(a)
and
not
to
a
determination
under
4(b).
we
do
not
know
how
they
make
that
selection,
one
of
that
triggers
for
coverage
of
the
state
under
the
act
is
a
determination
of
the
justice
department,
that
in
november
1972,
the
state
or
the
political
subdivision
employed
a
?test
or
device?.
we
submit,
we
feel
that
we
could
meet
the
tests
for
the
--
but
in
any
event,
the
justice
department
should
have
been
required
to
maintain
or
to
look
into
that
question.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
one
of
the
triggers,
if
the
court
please,
is
a
prior
determination
by
the
attorney
general
that
the
jurisdiction
employed
in
november,
employed
a
?test
or
device?
as
defined
there
and
it?s
to
find
in
4(c)...
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
well,
if
the
court
please,
i
think
obviously
this
act
must
be
to
sustain
its
constitutionality
as
the
court
did
in
south
carolina
against
katzenbach,
it
must
be
aimed
at
?test
or
devices?
which
have
the
purpose
or
effect
of
discriminating
in
voting
rights
and
it
can
not
just
be
any
?test
or
device?
regardless
and
we
submit
that
4(d)
is
a
proper
test
of
how
whether
or
not
a
jurisdiction
is
maintaining,
did
maintain
a
?test
or
device?,
not
just
for
takeout.
again,
it
is
very
easily
have
said
for
the
purposes
of
section
4(a),
?test
or
device?
means,
it
did
not
say
that,
it
said,
for
the
purposes
of
this
section
and
this
section
is
section
4
and
we
submit
that
at
least
congress,
the
attorney
general?s
office
should
have
given
consideration
to
whether
or
not
texas
met
the
tests
of
4(d).
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
that
i
think,
if
they
gave
good
faith,
attention
to
it,
considered
it,
i
think
that
would
meet
the
requirement.
but
they
expressly
state
that
they
did
not,
and
do
not,
and
will
not
and
that
is
what
we
are
challenging.
we
are
not
challenging
their
finding,
that
texas
maintained
the
?test
or
device?,
we
are
challenging
the
method
in
which
they
arrived
at
that
finding.
just
arbitrarily
reading
the
statute
as
they
would
read
it,
not
paying
any
attention
to
4(d)
and
we
say
the
statute
requires
that
they
consider
those
questions
in
making
their
determination.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
i
am
sure
they
have
given
thought
to
our
suggestion
that
they
ought
to
consider
it,
and
i
am
equally
sure
and
i
am
sorry,
i
can
not
tell
you
the
chapter
and
verse,
but
i
am
equally
sure
that
they
have
said
that
they
would
not
consider
it.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
they
say
in
their
brief
that
they
do
not
consider
it
and
they
are
not
required
to
and
we
say
they
are.
the
other
point,
i
would
like
to
make
very
briefly,
is
that
they
have
failed
to
consider
evidence,
which
is
readily
available
to
them.
now,
using
their
figures
and
we
are
not
in
the
numbers
game,
but
they
started
out
with
a
figure
that
--
which
they
get
by
interpolation
that
there
were
7,655,000
citizens
of
voting
age
in
texas
on
november
1,
1972,
and
we
do
not
agree
with
that
figure,
but
will
accept
it
for
the
sake
of
this
argument.
then
they
go,
they
say,
there
are
140,000
aliens
in
texas.
despite
the
fact
that
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
has
published
a
report
saying
that
november
1972,
there
were
2,600,000
illegal
mexican
aliens
in
united
states,
now
they
do
not
say
how
many
in
texas.
but
we
submit
they
are
the
ones
who
determine
upon
the
need
to
delete,
to
deduct
the
number
of
aliens
in
arriving
at
citizens
of
voting
age,
not
we.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
how
many,
as
i
say,
that
is
their
responsibility,
not
ours,
i
think.
what
we
are
saying
again,
i
do
not
want
to
say
a
particular
figure,
we
made
some
suggestions
in
our
brief
as
to
what
it
might
be.
but
what
we
are
saying
is
that
they
were
required
to
do
more
than
just
a
guess,
at
what
the
figures
might
be
and
here
is
a
figure
which
i
think
any
texan
would
be
absurd
to
say
that
there
are
only
a
140,000
aliens,
legal
and
illegal
in
texas
in
november
1972
of
voting
age.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
i
believe
it
is?
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
this
was
from
the
census,
these
figure
or
determinations
made
by
census.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
they
said
they
did
not.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
they
said
they
did
not
use
them;
they
used
figures
from
the
bureau
of
census.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
no,
they
did
not
say,
they
did
not
have
them,
i
am
sorry,
but
they
did
not
use
them,
mr.
zweiner
in
his
affidavit,
which
is
at
the
record
on
the
page
155
of
the
appendix
tells
how
the
determination
was
made.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
that
is
the
position
your
honors
please,
has
taken,
is
the
same
figure.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
only
if
they
same,
if
the
illegal
aliens
and
the
legal
aliens
did
not
appear
in
that
first
figure
of
the
population.
then
they
have
to
be
taken
out,
there
is
no
effort
made
to
find
out
or
to
determine
a
citizenship
of
a
person,
a
person
is
asked
on
the...
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
well,
we
feel,
if
the
court
please,
that
they
are
under
an
obligation
to
consider
these
figures
and
they
are
the
ones,
as
i
say,
who
determine
that
i
figure
was
necessarily
subtracted
for
illegal
aliens
and
we
submit
that
they
should
be
required
to
considered
all
of
the
evidence
again
on
that
factor.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
they
do
not
vouch,
if
the
court
please,
only
5%
of
the?
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
census
takes
it,
as
how
many
people
live
here,
15,
puts
down
15.
how
many
were
born
in
this
state
or
in
this
country,
all
of
those,
and
15
illegal
aliens
were
on
the
registers
as
residents
of
the
state
and
according
to
census
department
figures,
they
appear
as
citizens
of
the
state
of
texas.
an
illegal
alien
is
not
going
to
tell
anybody
that
he
is
an
illegal
alien.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
well,
he
may
not
have
to
make
the
admission
that
he
lives
there,
so
many
make
that
form,
he
is
counted
as
a
person
living
there,
we
have
to
assume
that
they
count,
they
count
everybody,
i
would
like
to
reserve
sometime
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
difference
between
a
bailout
suit,
what
we
are
asking
here
is
we
are
asserting
that
we
are
not
covered
and
never
were
covered
and
how
they
construed
the
statute
correctly,
we
would
not
cover
now
and
there
would
be
no?
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
court
please,
the
bailout
suit
we
would
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
for
ten
years,
this
suit
--
the
test
goes
back
to
november
1972
and
a
bailout
suit,
if
we
filed
it
today,
it
will
go
back
to
1967
and
texas
was
a
great
deal
of
difference.
but
we
feel
that
a
bailout
suit
at
this
time
will
be
premature
when
we
consider
the
fact
that
we
are
not
covered
in
the
first
one.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
we
feel
that
we
are
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
4(d)
now.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
we
would
have
the
benefit,
as
we
feel
we
ought
to
have
the
benefit
of
it
now
as
mr.
justice
powell
suggested.
i
would
like
to
answer
if
i
may
mr.
justice
stewart?s
questions
earlier
that
i
could
not
get
thinking
straight
on.
according
to
their
statistics,
they
took
the
census
bureau
figures
for
all
citizens,
all
residents
of
the
state.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
no,
i
am
sorry,
well,
then
they
deducted
from
that
the
figure
of
those
under
18,
so
they
got
a
figure
for
all
residents
of
the
state
of
voting
age
and
then
according
to
their
formula,
they
then
deducted
a
140,000
as
being
the
number
of
aliens
who
were
included
in
that
figure
and
we
submit
that
by
any
reasonable
means,
a
140,000
is
ridiculous
figure
for
texas
as
a
number
of
aliens
who
were
resident
in
the
state
at
that
time.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
it
is
in
the
hundreds
of
thousands,
i
am
not
certain
of
the
figures.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
the
bureau
of
naturalization,
immigration
and
naturalization
has
figures
available
we
feel,
just
recently
of
course.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
that
in
1972,
there
were
two
million
six
hundred
and
somewhat
thousand
illegal
mexican
aliens,
not
legal
but
illegal
mexican
aliens
in
the
united
states.
we
submit?
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
none
specifically,
we
feel
that
it
had
census
made
any
effort
to
determine
the
number
by
consulting
with
immigration,
naturalization
service,
it
could
have
determined
them.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
we
ask
that
the
declaratory
judgment
which
is
our
prayer
that
the
census
bureau
in
making
this
determination
be
required
to
use
the
best
information
available
to
determine
the
number
of
citizens
of
voting
age
in
the
state
and
that
they
did
not
do
that
in
the
case
ought
to
be
reminded
to
them
to
make
that
determination.
whatever
it
may
come
out
to
be,
they
acknowledged,
i
think
that
they
did
not
use
immigration
figures
or
anything
else.
used
the
answers
to
two
questions
on
the
census
form
which
are
in
best
ambiance.
contrary
to
what
mr.
shapiro
said,
we
do
not
concede
that
we
used
english
only
for
discriminatory
purposes
and
we
think
that
this
vastly
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
katzenbach
case
in
south
carolina
against
katzenbach,
the
court
found
that
the
proceedings
were
constitutional
absence
of
a
hearing
because
south
carolina
conceded
these
are
figures
which
were
beyond
dispute.
there
was
no
argument
about
them
and
south
carolina
was
covered
according
to
mr.
chief
justice
warren?s
opinion
and
that
is
not
true
here.
english
--
we
submit
that
statewide,
in
texas
as
in
every
other
state
of
the
union.
english
only
ballots
have
been
traditionally
used
and
not
as
a
discriminatory
device
and
if
you
read
the
history
set
out
by
the
amicus
curiae
in
their
brief
as
to
circumstances.
this
was
aimed
against
--
it
was
aimed
against
things
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
english
ballots.
thank
you.
