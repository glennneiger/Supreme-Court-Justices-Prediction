mr.
kendall,
how
can
you
argue,
the
statute
says,
50%
of
such
persons,
the
question
is
which
person,
if
you
looked
at
the
preceding
language,
the
persons
described
are
persons
of
voting
age.
so,
one
could
certainly
argue
?such
persons?
refer
back
to
the
persons
of
voting
age
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that
practical
effect
but
chromatically
one
could
read
it
the
way,
the
opponents
do
i
think.
