mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
just
describe
the
voting
rights
act
amendments
of
1975,
as
they
are
relevant
to
this
case,
then
discuss
the
statutory
preclusion
of
review
of
the
coverage
determinations
that
is
contained
in
section
4(b)
of
the
statute,
as
it
effects
the
district
court?s
jurisdiction,
and
then
address
the
merits
of
the
contentions,
texas
has
advanced.
the
statute
appears
in
the
brief
in
opposition
filed
by
the
respondents
at
appendix
1
(a)
through
6
(a).
there
are
one
or
two
provisions
which
we
have
not
set
forth,
which
i
will
mention
briefly.
one
preliminary
word,
the
statute
was
adopted
with
texas,
specifically
in
mind
and
so
far
as
the
minority
language
group
guarantee
is
concerned,
both
the
senate
and
the
house
reports
describe
this
in
detail,
as
did
the
hearings.
now,
the
1975
amendments
contained
a
number
of
titles.
in
title
2
of
the
amendments,
congress
made
express
findings
in
section
4(f)(1)
that
is
on
page
4(a)
that
voting
discrimination
against
citizens
of
certain
enumerated
language
minorities
was
pervasive
and
national
in
scope
and
that
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments,
it
was
necessary
to
eliminate
that
discrimination
by
prohibiting
english
only
elections
as
to
those
people
and
by
adopting
other
remedial
devices.
the
term
language
minority
was
in
turn
defined
in
section
14(c)(3)
of
the
act
which
we
have
not
printed,
to
mean
persons
belonging
to
american-indian,
native
alaskan,
asian-american
or
spanish
heritage
groups.
the
devices
under
title
ii
that
congress
adopted,
included
extension
of
the
existing
voting
rights
act
prohibitions
against
the
use
of
?tests
and
devices?
as
a
pre-requisite
for
voting.
a
requirement
for
pre-clearance
under
section
5
of
changes
in
the
coverage
jurisdictions
election
laws
and
there
were
necessary
assignment
of
federal
examiners
to
register
voters.
now,
let
me
distinguish
title
ii
from
title
iii,
because
there
is
some
material
in
the
record
that
refers
to
title
iii.
in
title
iii
of
the
amendments,
congress
also
adopted
some
separate
remedies
for
jurisdictions,
in
which
minority
language
voters
were
disadvantaged
because
of
educational
deficiencies,
but
there
did
not
seem
to
be
evidence
of
intentional
discrimination.
jurisdictions
covered
by
this
provision,
must
also
cover
conduct
elections
only
in
english,
but
the
special
remedies,
such
as
section
5
or
voting
examiners
are
not
applicable.
now
we
are
not
concerned
with
title
iii,
in
this
case
at
all.
in
this
case,
we
are
concerned
really
only
with
members
of
the
spanish
heritage
category
of
language
minority.
in
section
4(f)(2)
of
the
act,
congress
prohibited
denial
or
abridgement
of
the
right
to
vote
because
a
person
is
a
member
of
the
enumerated
language
minority.
it
added
a
third
sentence
to
the
existing
triggering
provisions,
providing
that
the
prohibition
against
the
use
of
tests
and
devices,
contained
in
the
act
would
apply
in
state
and
political
subdivisions
as
to
which
the
attorney
general
determined
maintained
on
november
1,
1972.
any
?test
or
device?
as
defined
in
the
act
and
with
respect
to
which
the
director
of
the
census
determined
that
less
than
50%
of
the
citizens
of
voting
age
who
were
registered
or
less
than
50%
voted
in
the
presidential
election
of
november
1972.
now,
this
was
a
change
in
the
coverage
formula,
the
previous
coverage
formula,
in
the
1965
act
and
the
1970
act
had
referred
to
persons
of
voting
age,
because
congress
was
addressing
the
problem
of
language
minority,
for
the
first
time,
it
focused
on
citizens
voting
only,
and
it
adopted
a
change
in
the
third
sentence,
specifying
that
only
citizens
could
vote,
that
is
how
the
alienage
problem
got
into
our
case.
the
term
?test
or
device?
had
been
defined
under
the
old
act
as
meaning
prerequisites
for
voting,
requiring
demonstration
of
literacy
or
education
achievement
or
knowledge,
good
moral
character
or
proof
of
qualifications
by
some
sort
of
vouchering.
in
section
4(f)(3),
congress
amended
the
definition
of
?test
or
device?
to
add
a
new
concept
which
is
what
we
are
dealing
with
here.
it
referred
to
provision
of
voting
materials
?only
in
english
language?
where
the
director
of
the
census
determines
that
more
than
5%
of
the
citizens
of
voting
age
residing
in
the
state
or
political
subdivision
are
members
of
a
single
language
minority.
now,
the
1965
act
as
amended,
makes
no
provision
in
these
triggering
sections
for
hearing.
it
also
bars
review
of
a
determination
by
the
attorney
general
or
director
of
the
census
with
respect
to
the
triggering
provisions.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
4
(b),
it
is
in
section
4
(b)
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
the
bar
against
review
would
affect
proceedings
in
the
three-judge
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
to
bailout
of
the
coverage,
under
section
4(a).
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
in
any
court,
it
says.
now
that
the
determination
by
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
is
whether
the
?tests
or
devices?
have
been
maintained
for
the
purpose
or
with
the
effect
of
discriminating
or
in
violation
of
the
language
guarantees.
the
only
way
in
which
the
attorney
general?s
determination
that
a
?test
or
device?
was
maintained
could
be
challenged,
is
if
the
jurisdiction
came
in
and
said,
we
could
not
be
using
it
for
the
discriminatory
purpose
because
we
do
not
have
any.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
the
nature
of
the
determinations,
the
attorney
general
makes
is
such
that,
i
do
not
think
there
will
ever
be
an
issue
of
that
kind.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
oh,
yes
the
provisions
of
4(d)
are
open.
now
4(d)
is
addressed
expressly
to
whether
the
?test
or
device?
was
maintained
for
the
purpose
or
with
the
--
for
a
discriminatory
purpose
or
with
a
discriminatory
effect.
that
is
the
4(d)
inquiry
and
it
is
addressed
only,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
then
the
court
is
not
to...
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
right,
so
the
court
is
then
to
hold
that
the
use
of
the
?test
or
device?
is
not
to
be
treated
as
discriminatory
in
purpose
or
effect.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
they
are
--
i
think
it
would
be
open
to
them
only
to
say
that
as
part
of
their
proof
that
they
were
not
discriminating,
that
they
did
not
have
the
test,
and
that
they
could
not
go
beyond
that
of
returning
to
the
structure
of
the
statute
then...
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
refers,
your
honor,
to
the
third
sentence
of
section
4(b)
which
setup
the
new
triggering
provisions,
and
that
is
on
page
2(a).
it
actually
begins,
let
me
make
sure,
i
have
got
my
pages,
i
am
sorry
your
honor,
that
is
3(a).
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
and
that
begins
--
actually
it
is
4
(a),
i
beg
your
pardon,
top
of
4(a),
?on
and
after
august
6,
1975?,
that
was
a
date
of
enactment
of
these
amendments,
and
than
the
new
triggering
provisions
were
stated.
the
proceeding
two
sentences
are
the
original
1965,
triggering
provision
and
the
1970
extension.
returning
then
to
the
structure
of
the
statute,
i
have
just
mentioned
that
under
section
4(a)
there
can
be
a
bailout
suit
with
respect
to
a
determination
of
the
use
of
a
?test
or
device?
for
the
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect.
this
is
the
only
time
that
such
an
inquiry
has
made
with
respect
to
the
definition
of
?test
or
device?
there
is
nothing
in
section
4(c)
defining
the
original
?test
or
device?,
nothing
in
section
4(f)(3),
defining
the
new
language
?test
or
device?
authorizes
an
inquiry
into
whether
or
not
the
?test
or
device?
has
a
purpose
or
effect.
so
that,
when
you
go
back
to
the
triggering
provision
and
look
at
what
the
attorney
general
has
to
determine,
you
will
see
that
on
page
4(a),
all
that
he
determines,
is
whether
the
jurisdiction
maintained
on
november
1,
1975,
any
?test
or
device?.
there
is
no
statutory
authorization
for
the
triggering
determination
to
inquire
into
whether
it
was
used
with
a
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect.
congress
made
that
determination
in
the
exercise
of
its
powers.
now,
i
would
like
to
talk
about
the
jurisdiction,
because
section
4(b)
bars
review
in
any
court
of
a
determination
and
certification,
of
the
attorney
general
and
the
director
of
the
census,
under
section
4
and
certain
other
enumerated
sections.
first,
let
me
say
that
the
attorney
general
now
agrees
with
the
court
of
appeals
construction
of
section
4(b)
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
was
a
very,
very
limited
ground
for
inquiry
under
the
statute
and
that
this
suit
is
permitted
because
of
that
very
limited
inquiry.
let
me
say
the
outset,
that
in
gaston
county
against
united
states
under
the
old
act
in
395
us,
the
court
stated
at
page
291
that
the
coverage
formula
chosen
by
congress
was
designed
to
be
speedy
objective
and
incontrovertible.
as
we
read
section
4(b),
the
only
matter
that
can
be
opened
to
record,
opened
to
review
on
this
record
is
whether
the
attorney
general
or
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
the
census
applied
some
coverage
formula
other
than
the
formula
chosen
by
congress,
and
that
is
all
that
can
be
reviewed.
in
the
face
of
an
expressed
preclusion
of
judicial
review
worded
like
section
4(b),
only
inquiry
that
is
available
on
this
record
is
whether
the
defendants
exceeded
their
statutory
authority.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
on
review.
well,
now,
they
said
25%
instead
of
50%
that
would
be
reviewable.
if
they
said,
we
will
--
although
the
statutes
said,
citizens
we
are
going
to
count
aliens,
deliberately,
that
is
reviewable.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
if
however,
as
in
this
case,
they
say,
we
know
we
are
not
supposed
to
count
aliens,
we
have
made
an
estimate
of
the
number
of
aliens,
we
think
we
should
deduct
and
we
have
deducted
them
from
our
calculations,
that
is
un-reviewable.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
after
some
consideration
of
the
precedence,
we
felt
we
were
bound
to
as
we
accessed
that
particular
provision,
we
can
only
see
three
possible
basis
for
judicial
review,
if
review
is
the
right
word
because
it
is
not
really
review.
first,
if
there
was
a
claim
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional,
then
we
think
despite
that
expressed
preclusion,
under
johnson
against
robison
in
415
us
jurisdiction
would
exists.
that
is
not
before.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
no,
the
4(d)
determination
goes
to
whether
the
?test
or
device?
was
used
with
a
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect
and
the
three-judge
court
would
make
a
determination
as
per
that.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
in
section
5,
but
that
would
come
before
the
attorney
general
in
section
5
of
the
act.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
he
objects
to
it.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
a
different
type
of
suit,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
completely...
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
4(d)
comes
in
only
with
respect
to
the
triggering
provisions.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
not
completely.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
to
the
extent
4(d)
permits
it,
but,
well,
the
trouble
is
that
the
triggering
determination
by
the
attorney
general
under
section
4
does
not
inquire
whether
the
?test
or
device?
was
used
with
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
in
the
bailout
suit
under
section
4(a).
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
let
us,
when
we
say
next
time,
let
us
distinguish
between
two
sections
of
the
statute
because
it
would
not
come
over
unless
i
make
the
distinction.
we
are
dealing
here
with
section
4
which
extends
the
coverage
of
the
act
to
the
jurisdictions
that
meet
the
test.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
once
the
jurisdiction
is
covered
by
section
4,
it
is
subject
to
the
remedies
of
section
5.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
section
5
remedy
requires
pre-clearance
by
the
attorney
general.
section
5
has
a
separate
provision
not
the
same
as
the
bailout
suit
which
authorizes
a
jurisdiction
to
go
into
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
clear
any
proposed
change
in
its
voting
laws,
and
the
section
4(d)
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
section
5
suit.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
not
to
my
knowledge,
but
section
4(d)
has
nothing
to...
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
in
a
bailout
suit
under
section
4,
that
is
right
and
only
there.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
texas
may
avail
itself
of
a
suit
of
under
4(d)
at
any
time,
it
files
a
bailout
suit
under
section
4(a)
of
the
act.
now,
the
bailout
formula
is
under
section
4(a)
is
set
forth
in
pages
1(a)
and
2(a)
of
the
appendix,
of
the
statutory
appendix
and
what
it
provides
is
that
a
state
as
to
which
a
triggering
determination
has
been
made,
thus
subjecting
the
state
to
the
coverage
of
the
act,
can
file
a
suit
in
a
three-judge
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
and...
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
and
only
there..
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
a
bailout
suit
like
any
suit
under
this
act
can
only
be
brought
to
district
of
columbia,
there
is
a
venue
limitation,
under
section
14.
the
bailout
suit
can
be
brought
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
try
to
show
that
no
such
?test
or
device?
has
been
used
during
the
ten
years
preceding
the
filing
of
the
action,
for
the
purpose
or
with
the
effect
of
denying
the
right
to
vote
on
a
kind
of
race
or
color.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
if
it
was
triggered
under
the
act
because
of
the
language
minority
provision,
it
is
only
10
as
set
forth
on
page
2(a).
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
is
right
and
i
was
about
to
outline
or
i
suggested
three
possible
grounds.
one,
if
texas
was
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
that
the
bar
against
review
would
not
apply
johnson
v.
robison.
second,
if
this
were
a
suit
in
the
nature
of
an
action
in
mandamus
to
compel
some
sort
of
duty,
old
texas
--
such
as
to
make
a
determination
under
the
act.
then
we
think
that
there
might
be
relief
under
28
u.s.c
1361,
for
example,
to
compel
the
attorney
general
to
make
up
his
mind.
that
is
not
this
case,
because
this
is
a
essentially
a
challenge
to
determinations.
third,
a
claim
that
the
action
is
in
plain
violation
of
an
expressed
statutory
or
statutory
requirement
or
prohibition
and
to
the
extent,
there
is
any
review
and
there
is
a
very
limited
review,
that
comes
into
this
case.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
we
seek
to
be
consistent
in
our
argument,
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
mandamus
action,
i
should
point
out
that
the
mandamus
action
in
gressette
involves
a
suit
to
make
the
attorney
general
besides
them
and
this
is
not
that
kind
of
a
case.
the
attorney
general
has
decided
here
?
moreover
i
point
out
that
section
4(b)
is
an
express
restriction
on
judicial
review,
the
action
in
gressette
is
under
section
5,
there
is
no
statutory
bar
of
the
same
kind
to
the
section
5
mandamus,
that
you
might
find
in
section
4(b).
well,
now
this
is
the
first
case
to
reach
this
court
under
the
voting
rights
act,
amendments
of
1975
and
texas
has
been
brought
under
the
act
for
the
first
time
in
these
amendments.
it
was
not
under
the
earlier
act
because
it
did
not
maintain
the
kind
of
?test
or
device?
described
in
the
previous
statute,
it
is
conceded,
there
is
no
issue
as
to
constitutionality.
now,
there
is
no
issue,
it
is
conceded
that
texas
used
the
?test
or
device?
within
the
meaning
of
the
language
minority
definition
contained
in
section
4(f)(3)
of
the
act
because
texas
has
more
than
5%
citizens
of
voting
age
of
spanish
heritage
and
it
concedes
that
reference
to
election
materials
only
in
english.
so,
there
is
just
no
issue
as
to
what
the
attorney
general
was
to
decide.
the
statute
says
the
attorney
general
decides
whether
they
maintain
the
?test
or
device?
within
the
meaning
of
section
4(f)(3),
they
concede
that
they
did.
no
issue
as
to
that,
they
contend
however
that
the
attorney
general
should
have
considered
whether
they
used
it
for
a
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect
the
statute
just
does
not
authorize
the
attorney
general
to
decide
that,
it
is
not
in
there.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
i
would
have
to
say
that
to
the
extent
the
error
of
law
is
one
which
does
not
go
to
whether
the
attorney
general
act,
whether
the
official
has
acted
in
excess
of
his
authority,
depends
on
how
much
discretion
he
is
been
given.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
formula
is
specific
enough
that
we
think
it
comes
within
the
excess
of
authority
as
i
mentioned.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
answering
the
question
generally
and
answering
it
specifically...
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
answering
your
specific
questions,
since
the
statute
expressly
says
50%
of
persons
of
citizens
of
voting
age,
the
50%...
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
we
could
not
use
less
than
50%
without
acting
in
excess
of
the
statute,
what
i
said
before
was
that
we
can
not
use
the
coverage
formula
different
than
that
specified...
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
i
think
what
i
said
was
that
if
the
attorney
general
or
the
bureau
of
the
census
attempted
to
apply
a
formula
different
than
that
expressed
in
the
language.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
as
long
as
it
is
within
a
reasonable
scope,
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yeah,
if
he
chooses
50%
and
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
let
me
try
and
illustrate
it
in
this
way.
in
so
far
as
texas?
arguing
that
is
a
matter
of
law,
the
director
of
the
census
erred
in
relying
upon
census
data,
now
he
had
to
determine
how
many
citizens
there
were.
he
had
to
find
out
from
some
source
where
that
information
came
from,
he
did
not
use
the
immigration
naturalization
figures,
he
used
his
own
1970
decennial
census
projections.
now,
to
the
extent
that
he
relied
on
his
own
data
and
he
made
a
calculation
for
alienage,
that?s
not
reviewable.
congress
knew
that
there
is
a
limitation
on
how
you
can
determine
who
is
an
illegal
alien
and
who
there
was
not.
now,
in
so
far
as
texas?
contending
that
it
is
excluded
from
the
act
because
more
than
50%
of
its
citizens
of
voting
age
were
registered,
less
than
50%
actually
voted.
it
is
raising
an
issue
of
law
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
we
think
that
that
much
is
reviewable.
we
also
think
its
contentions
are
defeated
by
the
plain
legislative
history
because
attorney
general
john
katzenbach
got
up
and
actually
said
the
words,
?such
persons?
in
this
statute
means
persons
who
actually
voted.
the
statute
has
been
reenacted,
it
is
been
construed
that
way
consistently.
now,
finally
there
is
a
claim
about
hearing.
the
issues,
the
triggering
determinations
here
involved
with
the
court
called
in
south
carolina
against
katzenbach,
objective
statistical
determinations
by
the
census
bureau
in
a
routine
analysis
of
state
statutes
by
the
department
of
justice.
issues
of
that
kind
do
not
require
a
hearing,
in
any
event
the
hearing
such
as
that
is
required,
is
provided
after
the
fact
in
the
bailout
suit
except
to
the
extent
that
the
triggering
determination
can
not
be
reviewed,
but
the
state
can
get
out
from
under
the
statute,
it
can
get
out
from
under
4(a)
in
the
bailout
suit
in
connection
with
its
contention
that
?test
or
device?
which
it
concedes
in
this
case
was
not
used
for
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
there
is
not,
the
suit
could
be
brought
today,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
had
to
be
brought
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
as
any
suit
under
the
voting
challenging,
a
determination
under
the
voting
rights
act,
must
be
section
14(b)
of
the
voting
rights
act
requires
that.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
would
have
to
--
the
venue
provision
in
14(b)
expressly
says
that
any
suit
to
enjoin
or
declare
an
action
of
an
official
under
this
act
must
be
brought
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
is
much
broader,
there
are
a
number
of
bailout
provisions
in
this
act,
there
are
the
special
bailout
provisions
under
section
4,
there
is
the
special
provision
for
challenging
section
5
determinations,
there
is
a
special
provision
under
title
iii
for
more
moderate
language
restrictions.
all
of
those
suits
as
far
as
i
can
recall,
must
be
brought
to
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia.
indeed
the
fact
that
congress
in
section
14(b)
mentions
the
possibility
of
a
suit
to
enjoin
the
action
of
an
official,
indicates
that
it
anticipated
the
possibility
that
there
would
be
some
areas
where
official
action
could
be
challenged,
could
be
reviewed.
sometimes,
it
is
specified
three-judge
court
as
in
a
bailout
suit
or
in
a
section
5
suit.
sometimes
it
did
not.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
voting
--
i
do
not
know
the
total
number
of
people
in
the
voting
rights
section.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
they
are
20,
texas
of
course
has
been
an
unusual
problem
because
texas
has
254
counties
and
an
enormous
number
of
election
districts
of
one
kind
and
another,
water
districts,
voting
districts,
school
districts,
municipalities,
despite
the
act
also
is
retroactive
in
1972.
so
that
there
has
been
a
large
backlog,
most
of
these
changes
have
been
what
attorney
general
katzenbach
anticipated
rather
performa
change
that
do
not
affect
significant
rights,
the
ones
that
the
attorney
general
has
been
concerned
about
are
those
that
change
at
large
elections,
some
statewide
procedures
that
are
called
for
example
for
a?
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
is
quite
a
large
section
and
it
is
--
i
can
not?
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
imagine,
i
assume
it
is
been
expanded,
i
suspect
it
is
still
overwhelmed,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
at
least
the
administration
or
the
act
particularly
section
5
which
we
are
not
concerned
within
this
case
is
from?
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
original
complaint
was
filed
before
the
attorney
general
had
made
his
determination,
i
think
it
was
filed
just
after
the
bureau
of
the
census
had
made
its
determination.
the
attorney
general
decided
the
case
after
the
district
court
ruled
dismissing
the
complaint,
the
court
of
appeals
noted
that
fact
but
concluded
that
since
the
issue
was
before
it,
there
was
no
point
in
sending
the
case
back
for
what
would
be
a
simple
formal
reconsideration.
so
it
addresses
the
question
of
the
attorney
general?s.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
language
of
the
statute
is
whether
the
state
maintained
a
?test
or
device?
on
november
1,
1972.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
we
think
that
the
better
remedy
would
have
been
for
them
to
file
a
bailout
suit,
if
they
can
demonstrate.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
but
the
clear
implication
of
4(d)
is
that
it
will
apply
with
respect
through
the
determination
for
the
purposes
or
with
the
effect
of
maintaining
a
discriminatory
?test
or
device?.
now,
the
attorney
general
does
not
make
that
inquiry.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
because
the
statute
does
not
authorize
them
to,
section
4
(b)
provides
only
that
he
will
determine
whether
the
?test
or
device?
was
maintained.
now,
texas
may
bring
a
bailout
suit
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
and
it
may
point
to
its
1975
statute
and
say
that
shows
that
we
are
not
maintaining
a
?test
or
device?
with
the
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect
and
having
done
so
and
that
any
incidence
of
discrimination
were
sporadic
as
described
in
4(d).
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
they
could
do
that
this
afternoon
and
that
would
be
an
issue
for
district
of
columbia,
they
have
not
brought
such
a
suit
because
i
think
that
the
history
of
discrimination
in
texas
which
led
to
the
adoption
of
this
act
is
such
that
they
can
not
meet
the
standard
in
such
a
suit.
although
i
am
simply
speculating,
i
may
very
well
prevail
such
a
suit.
thank
you,
your
honor.
