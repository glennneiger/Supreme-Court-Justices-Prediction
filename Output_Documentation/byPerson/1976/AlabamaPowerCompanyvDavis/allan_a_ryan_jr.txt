mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
would
say
you
have
to
look
at
the
plan.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
that
language
means
that
while
the
employee
is
in
uniform,
while
he
is
serving
in
the
military,
the
employer
is
obligated
during
that
time
to
provide
him
with
the
same
benefits
as
the
employer
provides
to
employees
who
are
on
nonmilitary
leave
of
absence,
and
the
court
in
accardi
supports
that
reasoning.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
it
is
a
very
difficult
job
to
reconcile
it
with
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
the
statute
speaks
of
persons
who
are
restored,
and
the
argument,
i
would
think,
is
that
while
an
employee
is
in
uniform,
he
has
not
yet
been
restored.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
that
is
absolutely
our
position,
mr.
justice.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
i
think
we
agree
that
it
is
not
applicable
in
this
case;
but
i
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
he
gets
no
better
break
than
his
counterpart
who
never
went
into
the
army,
and
that
is
what
congress
intended.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
the
veteran
whose
employer
adopts
a
plan
in
1960
is
to
be
treated
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
any
other
employee
who
has
been
with
the
company
for
an
equal
length
of
time
who
did
not
go
into
the
army.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
it
is
a
different
reason
from
the
one
mr.
justice
stewart
suggests,
yes,
sir,
it
is.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
will
not
quarrel
with
that
reason,
mr.
justice;
but
i
think
in
this
case,
it
is
not
necessary
to
reach
that
point.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
he
must
work
20
years,
or
15
years
having
reach
to
the
age
of
50.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
at
65
unless
it
is
waived.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
he
took
an
early
retirement
at
61,
that
is
correct.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
really
just
one
issue
in
this
case
is
the
credit
for
pension
plan
purposes,
a
credit
and
i
quote
now,
from
accardi,
“which
would
have
automatically
accrued
to
the
veteran
had
he
remained
in
private
employment
rather
than
responding
to
the
call
of
his
country.”
if
so,
then
mr.
davis
is
entitled
to
that
credit
and
i
do
not
understand
my
opponent
to
disagree
with
that
proposition.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
court
should
find
that
this
credit
is
based
on
the
performance
of
actual
work,
then
the
credit
is
not
a
function
of
seniority
and
alabama
power
company
is
obligated
to
provide
such
credit,
only
if
it
does
so
for
employees
on
leave
of
absence.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
do
i
understand
mr.
chief
justice
the
issue
of
whether
the
power
company
paid
mr.
davis
while
he
was
in
the
service?
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
an
equivalent
proposition.
i
think
that
the
fact
that
the
company
did
not
pay
him
compensation
is
nothing
more
than
a
reflection
of
a
fact
that
he
did
not
perform
any
work
for
the
company
during
that
time.
compensation
in
that
sense
is
a
fundamentally
different
aspect
of
the
employment
relationship
than
the
pension
plan.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
if
the
employer
did
pay
the
employee
while
he
was
in
the
service,
i
would
assume
that
they
would
continue
the
pension
plan,
but
i
would
not
say
that
it
would
have
to
follow
automatically.
i
think
that,
had
the
power
company
paid
mr.
davis
for
the
time
he
was
in
the
service
and
not
extended
him
credit
for
the
pension
plan
that
this
case
would
be
no
different
than
it
is.
i
do
not
think
the
pension
plan
is
tied
to
whether
the
company
decides
to
pay
him
compensation
or
not.
i
think
the
court’s
enquiry
is
whether
the
pension
plan
as
such
is
a
different
aspect
of
the
employment
relationship
than
compensation
and
we
believe
that
it
is.
we
believe
that
the
pension
is
based
on
longevity
of
service
and
is
not
based
on
the
amount
of
work
that
the
employee
actually
performs
for
the
companies.
therefore,
we
believe
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed.
under
accardi,
the
court
must
look
to
the
real
nature
of
the
pension
benefit.
it
cannot
be
bound
by
narrow
definitions
or
the
industrial
practice.
as
it
said,
it
would
not
be
in
accardi.
we
think
that
under
that
analysis,
pension
plans
are
aspects
of
seniority.
first,
pension
plans
require
an
employee
to
work
for
many
years
before
he
receives
any
benefit
at
all.
typically,
an
employee
under
this
plan
as
under
others
must
work
to
age
65
to
receive
full
benefits
and
he
must
work
15
or
more
years
to
receive
any
benefits
at
all.
we
submit
that
when
it
is
possible
for
an
employee
to
work
10
or
15
or
even
more
years
and
not
receive
any
pension
at
all,
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
that
the
pension
as
simply
being
a
form
of
deferred
compensation.
moreover,
pension
plans
fill
needs
of
the
employer
that
other
aspects
of
the
employment
relationship
do
not
and
the
district
court
based
its
decision
we
feel
on
this
ground.
employers
naturally
want
a
stable
and
experienced
workforce
and
the
promise
of
a
pension
after
years
of
service
encourages
employees
to
stay
with
the
company
throughout
their
career
and
this
serves
the
need
of
the
employer
to
develop
that
stable
workforce.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
would
say
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
that
inquiry,
as
you
have
put
it
is
reversed.
that
what
the
court
should
look
at
first
as
was
established
in
accardi
is
whether
the
benefited
issue
is
a
function
of
seniority,
if
the
court
finds
that
it
is
such,
then
it
has
no
need
to
go
to
the
second
clause.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
the
statute
in
its
words
of
course,
does
not
mention
pension
plans
and
the
question
is
whether
the
plan
is
an
aspect
of
seniority
or
not.
the
court…
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
because
the
court
in
accardi
said,
that
the
other
benefits
clause
was
intended
to
add
certain
benefits
to
the
veteran
and
not
take
away
any
that
were
established
by
the
seniority
clause.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
that
is
one
way
of
reading
that
statute
mr.
justice.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
in
that
if
the
phrase
is
read
in
that
sense,
it
essentially
discriminates
against
veterans
who
went
into
the
service
prior
to
the
time
that
their
employer
adopted
a
pension
plan.
in
other
words,
if
this
pension
plan,
in
this
case
had
been
adopted
in
1940,
instead
of
in
1944,
the
reading
that
i
understand
you
to
advance
would
not
grant
him
the
benefit.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
would
say
if
there
was
no
plan
in
effect
when
he
went
into
the
armed
forces…
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
would
say
that
is
unacceptable,
that
that
is
a
consistent
reading
with
the
statute,
yes.
i
think
there
are
other
benefits
to
the
employer
that
accrue
from
a
pension
plan
which
we
discussed
in
our
brief.
one
is
the
incentive
that
it
gives
to
older
workers,
to
retire
with
some
measure
of
financial
security.
this
in
turn
opens
up
the
channels
of
advancement
within
the
organization
for
younger
workers
to
advance,
that
in
itself
is
an
attractive
aspect
of
the
job
to
younger
employers
in
addition
to
the
substantive
benefits
of
the
pension
plan.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
no
mr.
chief
justice,
he
would
not
be
exempted
from
paying
that.
what
the
statute
commands
is
only
that
he
be
restored
without
loss
of
seniority.
it
does
not
grant
him
any
benefits
that
his
counterpart
in
the
job
does
not
have.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
am.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
money
in
the
fund
is
exactly
what
we
are
asking
for,
but
it
is
not
money
that
his
civilian
counterpart
does
not
have.
the
court
in
accardi
said
that
there
is
no
point
in
awarding
a
man
seniority,
if
you
then
deny
him
the
perquisites
that
flow
from
it.
so,
what
we
are
asking
is
that
he
stands
in
the
same
shoes
as
his
civilian
counterpart
who
stayed
on
the
job
while
mr.
davis
went
off
to
serve
in
the
military.
we
are
not
asking
that
he
get
any
benefit
that
his
civilian
counterpart
does
not
have
and
so
under
that
rationale
it
is
only
fair
that
he
pays
his
$100
a
year
just
like
his
civilian
counterpart.
that
is
the
essential
command
of
the
statute
that
it
apply
evenly,
that
the
benefits
flow
evenly
both
to
veteran
and
non-veteran
alike.
so,
in
a
contributory
plan
he
would
be
entitled
to
pay
his
fair
share.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
it
does
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
a
part
of
the
plan
itself.
i
maybe
mistaken
in
that,
but
i
do
not
think
that…
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
it
is
a
non
contributory
plan.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
think
our
argument
does
get
support
from
that
statute,
although
the
court
has
mentioned
on
several
occasions
that
c2
is
a
codification
of
the
escalator
principle
that
the
court
announced
in
fishgold
in
1945
or
1946.
congress
effectively
approved
fishgold
by
enacting
c2,
but
that
escalator
principle
is
of
course,
the
guts
of
our
argument
that
under
fishgold
he
does
not
step
back
on
the
escalator
at
the
point
he
stepped
off.
he
steps
back
on
at
the
point
he
would
have
been
at,
had
he
not
gone
into
the
service.
i
think
in
looking
at
the
pension
plan
as
one
which
benefits
employer
as
well
as
employee,
it
becomes
clear
that
the
plan
is
an
incentive
to
maintain
a
continuing
employment
relationship
with
the
company.
the
worker
is
paid
wages
and
vacations
and
other
short-term
benefits
for
the
work
that
he
does
from
day
to
day
but
the
pension
is
over
and
above
this,
it
is
an
incentive
for
him
to
return
to
the
job
day
after
day
and
the
pension
is
withheld
from
him
unless
he
stays
on
the
job
until
age
65.
the
full
pension
at
any
rate
is
withheld
until
he
is
of
age
65
and
it
is
this
unique
aspect
we
submit
to
the
court,
that
sets
the
pension
apart
from
other
incidents
of
the
employment
relationship
from
other
collectively
bargained
benefits
and
demonstrates
that
what
counts
is
the
simple
and
continued
status
as
an
employee
and
therefore,
under
the
principles
of
accardi
and
foster
and
indeed
all
cases
which
this
court
has
decided
construing
the
statute,
the
time
spent
in
the
military
must
be
credited
to
the
veteran
or
else
he
loses
ground,
as
compared
to
a
civilian
counterpart.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
the
court
has
decided
that
assuming
that
the
pay
raise
is
automatic.
i
think
tilton
and
other
cases
along
that
line
have
held
that.
they
have
held
that
if
there
is
some
managerial
discretion
involved
then
it
is
not
as
clear
question,
but
the
automatic
promotion
has
been
held
at
the
incident
of
seniority.
under
this
plan
i
think,
what
i
have
said
about
pensions
is
quite
clearly
illustrated
because
under
this
plan,
if
you
are
on
the
payroll,
you
are
accumulating
accredited
service
whether
you
are
working
or
not.
if
you
are
not
on
the
payroll,
you
are
not
accumulating
accredited
service
except
under
circumstances
that
were
stipulated
below
is
being
brief,
infrequent
and
exceptional.
so,
what
is
required,
the
simple
status
of
being
on
the
payroll
and
not
as
petitioner
argues,
the
actual
performance
of
work.
it
is
the
continuing
employment
relationship
with
the
company
that
counts
here
and
that
is
what
seniority
is
all
about.
let
me
illustrate
with
two
examples.
there
is
accredited
service
accumulated
for
the
employee
for
those
times
when
he
is
on
vacation,
when
he
on
sick
leave,
when
he
is
on
holiday,
even
despite
the
fact
that
during
those
periods
he
is
performing
no
actual
work.
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin
there
is
no
additional
accredited
service
for
the
time
that
he
is
working
in
an
overtime
capacity,
even
though
of
course,
he
is
performing
work
during
those
hours
and
if
this
were
truly
a
form
of
deferred
compensation
as
my
opponent
argues,
both
of
these
features
would
be
absent
and
in
both
cases
the
work
performed
is
divorced
from
the
credit
received.
let
me
put
this
example
if
i
may,
two
workers
born
on
the
same
day
each
goes
to
work
for
the
company
on
his
18th
birthday,
each
retires
at
his
65th
birthday
having
performed
an
equal
amount
of
work
for
the
company.
each
starts
to
receive
a
pension
at
age
65
which
of
course,
is
exactly
equal
for
both
workers.
worker
a
dies
after
one
year,
worker
b
lives
for
20
years
after
his
retirement.
worker
b
receives
20
times
as
much
in
pension
benefits
over
the
course
of
his
life
as
worker
a
did.
despite
the
fact
that
each
of
them
performed
the
same
work
for
the
company
--
and
i
am
not
referring
a
military
service
at
all
in
this
hypothetical.
my
point
is
to
illustrate
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
conceive
of
this
plan
as
simply
deferred
compensation,
when
worker
b
receives
20
times
as
much
in
the
way
of
benefits
simply
because
of
the
fact
that
he
lives
longer
more
than
20
times
as
much
as
worker
a
despite
having
performed
exactly
the
same
amount
of
work.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that
and
we
are
not
attacking
the
plan
in
any
sense
in
that
respect,
but
i
think
it
illustrates
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
except
that
in
one
case
the
worker
is
receiving…
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
...20
times
more.
let
me
stress
one
other
point
because
i
think
there
was
a
suggestion
by
the
petitioner
that
extending
credit
to
mr.
davis
at
this
late
date
with
prejudice
to
the
company
because
the
company
could
not
foresee
in
1943
and
1944
and
1945
that
these
payments
would
be
required.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
there
is
no
evidence
on
this
point
but
even
the
argument
itself
fails
to
hold
water
because…
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
1944.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
he
was
an
employee
at
the
time
that
the
pension
plan
was
instituted
he
started
employment
in
1936
and
he
was
an
employee
even
though
he
was
off
in
uniform
at
the
time
that
the…
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
the
amendment
in
1966
which
is
now
section
iii
a
of
roman
numeral
three
of
the
plan
and
it
is
on
page
61
and
62
of
the
appendix.
under
this
amendment
and
this
i
stress,
was
passed
in
1966
an
employee
is
given
retroactive
credit
for
his
military
service
during
world
war
ii
in
korea,
less
one
year
if
he
worked
for
the
company
prior
to
his
25th
birthday.
in
other
words,
the
company
said
in
1966,
we
will
allow
you
to
fill
the
gap
in
credit
caused
by
military
service
by
talking
the
time
you
worked
for
us
before
you
entered
the
plan,
your
25th
birthday
and
using
that
to
fill
the
gap,
less
one
year.
the
only
reason
that
could
not
apply
to
mr.
davis
is
because
he
did
not
go
to
work
for
the
company
until
he
was
26,
but
the
point
is
this,
that
the
company
cannot
be
heard
to
complain
now,
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
that
affirming
the
judgment
below
would
cause
it
a
great
hardship
when
in
1966
the
fund
was
apparently
solvent
enough
to
grant
retroactive
military
credit
to
some
employees.
i
think
that
the
court
should
not
consider
this
a
very
tightly
correlated
fund
when
it
has
the
flexibility
to
do
that.
i
thank
the
court.
