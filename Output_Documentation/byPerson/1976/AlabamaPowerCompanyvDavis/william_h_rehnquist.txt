justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ryan,
let
me
go
back
a
minute
to
the
provisions
of
c1,
which
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
were
asking
you
about
yesterday
afternoon
and
that
provision
after
we
talk
about
restore
without
loss
of
seniority
that
shall
be
entitled
to
participate
in
insurance
or
other
benefits
offered
by
the
employer
person
to
establish
rules.
wouldn't
it
be
a
perfectly
orthodox
statutory
construction
to
say
that
that
portion
of
the
statute
grants
all
it
is
to
be
granted
in
the
way
of
participation
in
insurance
or
other
benefits?
in
other
words,
they
cover
what
they
wanted
to
give
the
ex-serviceman
in
the
way
of
insurance
or
other
benefits
in
that
portion
and
therefore,
you
cannot
go
back
and
read
seniority
as
covering
the
grant
of
pension
plan.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
the
expressio
unius
rule,
where
the
statute
has
in
so
many
words
covered
what
a
returned
serviceman
shall
get
in
a
way
of
pension
plans,
you
do
not
go
to
some
broader
phrase
and
include
it
under
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
not
the
question
be
whether
it
is
closer
to
participation
in
insurance
or
other
benefits?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
agreed
yesterday
that
was
a
dicta.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then,
that
is
a
contributory
plan?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
non
contributory.
