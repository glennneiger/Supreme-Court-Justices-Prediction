mr.
boles,
is
the
plan
clear
in
its
application
to
employees
who
are
on
furlough
or
leave
of
absence?
i
should
think
if
it
were,
then
this
would
be
open
and
shut,
isn’t
it
--
wouldn’t
it?

...this
problem
in
this
case,
but
the
payment
does
not
depend
upon,
in
any
way
upon,
how
much
you
work.
if
you
are
a
fulltime
regular
employee
you
are
not
given
any
more
credit
for
overtime
or
any
less,
i
mean
you
get
the
same
if
you
are
–-
it
is
40
hour
a
week
and
it
is
a
same
contribution
even
if
you
work
40
hours
overtime,
isn’t
it?
