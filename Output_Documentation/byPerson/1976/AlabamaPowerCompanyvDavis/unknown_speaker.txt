unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
true
of
someone
on
leave
of
absence,
too.
lumley
against
wagner
forbids
the
specific
performance
of
contracts
for
personal
service
as
no
employee
is
ever
bound
by
contract
to
come
back
to
his
employer
in
a
sense
of
an
enforceable
obligation.
unknown
speaker
now,
do
you
give
him
seniority
for
the
two-year
time
that
he
has
gone
to
college?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
clearly
an
employee
who
left
to
go
in
the
military
was
entitled
to
have
seniority
in
the
sense
of
job-bidding
preference,
and
if
your
leave-of-absence
man
got
seniority,
but
nothing
else,
i
would
think
you
have
man
returning
from
the
military
would
...
or,
rather,
if
your
leave-of-absence
man
got
your
...
well,
now
i
have
lost
my
chain
of
thought,
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
what
about
a
sick
leave?
let
us
say
an
employee
has
tuberculosis
and
has
a
one-year
leave
of
absence,
and
he
is
not
being
paid.
is
there
any
contribution
paid
into
the
fund
for
his
account?
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
noncontributory
plan,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
do
i
correctly
understand
that
this
really
gets
down
to
the
computation
of,
“accredited
service”,
upon
the
basis
in
which
you
compute
the
amount
of
the
pension.
isn't
that
right
under
the
plan?
unknown
speaker
now,
under
the
plan,
is
it
the
basic
thing?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
in
that
formula
don't
you
apply
a
multiplier
of
the
total
use
of
accredited
service?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
have
the
impression
that
the
plan
does
not
include
military
service
in
accredited
service.
unknown
speaker
no,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
why
we
got
the
case,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
you
do
not
include
in
that
last
element
military.
unknown
speaker
and
it
may
not
include
other
things;
but
in
any
event,
you
do
not
include
military
service.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
why
we
have
the
case,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
the
case
depends
upon
the
statute,
and
the
statute
appears
on
page
3
of
the
brief
of
the
respondent;
and
c-1(b)
--
no,
just
c-1
--
equates
this
thing
to
what
happens
to
employees
who
are
on
furlough
or
leave
of
absence,
and
that
is
the
critical
issue
in
this
case.
and
what
does
happen
to
employees
under
your
plan
who
are
on
furlough
or
leave
of
absence?
that
is
dispositive
of
this
statutory
question.
unknown
speaker
do
they
get
credit
for
lost
seniority?
unknown
speaker
two
years
to
go
to
college.
unknown
speaker
he
gets
it
by
statute.
unknown
speaker
it
gets
it
by
the
same
statutory
provisions.
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
why
you
cannot
necessarily
say
that
because
you
treat
other
leaves
of
absence
the
way
you
treat
military
leave
the
same
you
are
following
the
statute,
because
the
statute
requires
different
treatment
in
some
situations.
unknown
speaker
if
a
certain
benefits
is
a
function
of
seniority,
you
have
to
give
it
to
them.
unknown
speaker
certainly.
unknown
speaker
even
though
you
do
not
to
people
who
are
on
leave.
unknown
speaker
the
statute
entitles
the
returning
veteran
to
three
separate
guarantees:
he
shall
be
restored
without
loss
of
seniority,
he
shall
be
entitled
to
participate
in
insurance
or
other
benefits
offered
by
the
employer
pursuant
to
established
rules
and
practices
relating
to
employees
on
furlough
or
leave
of
absence,
and
he
shall
not
be
discharged
from
such
position
without
cause
within
one
year
after
such
restoration.
those
are
three
separate
guarantees.
i
take
it
we
are
now
considering
the
second
one
that
i
read.
unknown
speaker
so
it
seems
to
me
relatively
simple.
unknown
speaker
mr.
boles,
isn't
there
another
qualification
in
that
language;
it
is
in
accordance
with
rules
in
effect
at
the
time
he
went
into
service,
and
wasn't
this
plan
adopted
after
this
man
went
into
the
service?
unknown
speaker
you
said
you
"bestowed"
them
on
him.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
pension
plan
was
adopted
after
he
went
in
the
service,
then
the
language
mr.
justice
stewart
read
really
does
not
apply,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
we
really
--
unknown
speaker
in
dollar
amounts,
is
there
a
$17
difference
as
suggested
between
what
he
has
been
getting
and
what
he
would
get
if
he
were
credited
with
the
two-and-a-half
years
of
military
service?
unknown
speaker
$17.11
a
month.
unknown
speaker
mr.
boles,
would
you
give
me
one
other
factual
bit
of
information
i
am
confused
on?
unknown
speaker
anything
over
a
year.
unknown
speaker
does
what
you
are
saying
add
up
to
the
fact
that
the
dispute
over
the
right
of
the
veteran
never
affects
eligibility;
it
may
sometimes
affect
the
dollars
he
receives
and
that
is
all?
unknown
speaker
why,
it
is
assumed
he
did
the
service,
but
it
is
not
assumed
that
he
earned
any
wages,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
unknown
speaker
did
you
characterize
the
payments
under
the
plan
as
deferred
compensation?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
how
do
you
count
for
taking
into
the
plan
services
rendered
prior
to
july
of
1944?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
not
clear
that
it
does,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
he
had
no
claim
to
any
pension
plan,
did
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
interpret
the
last
part
of
the
section
c1
on
page
3
of
your
brief
when
you
talk
about
"participate
in
insurance
or
other
benefits
offered
by
the
employer
pursuant
to
established
rules
and
practices
relating
to
employees
on
furlough
or
leave
of
absence
in
effect
with
the
employer
at
the
time
such
person
was
inducted
into
such
forces".
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
dicta
in
accardi,
and
how
do
you
reconcile
it
with
the
actual
language
itself?
unknown
speaker
it's
impossible.
unknown
speaker
was
persuaded
to
render
that
dicta.
unknown
speaker
it
is
your
position,
then,
that
this
case
is
to
be
judged
under
that
provision?
unknown
speaker
now,
i
would
have
thought
that
the
second
stage,
being
very
explicit
with
respect
to
--
what
would
you
call
it?
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
seem
to
be
applicable,
because
there
was
no
plan
at
the
time
he
was
inducted
into
the
armed
forces.
unknown
speaker
well
then
if
you
are
right,
the
guy
gets
a
much
better
break
if
his
employer
adopts
a
plan
in
1960
than
if
he
adopted
one
in
1940.
unknown
speaker
but
he
gets
a
better
...
the
man
who
went
into
the
army
in
1940
and
his
employer
had
a
pension
plan
then
is
limited
to
the
terms
of
the
pension
plan
that
was
in
effect
in
1940,
whereas
the
man
who
went
in
in
1940
and
the
pension
plan
is
not
adopted
until
1960
gets
better
treatment,
even
though
he
--
presumably,
there
were
no
elements
of
reliance
there.
unknown
speaker
but
your
reason
for
the
inapplicability
of
that
provision
we
have
been
talking
about
is
a
different
reason.
unknown
speaker
would
you
accept
that
reason,
in
addition?
unknown
speaker
and
he
must
be,
what,
at
least
60
years
old?
unknown
speaker
and
then
it
is
compulsory
retirement
at
65?
unknown
speaker
and
this
petitioner
voluntarily
retired
at
61,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
believe
that
point
is
dicta
mr.
justice.
i
believe
the
dictate
point
was
the
part
of
accardi
which
discussed
the
rationale
of
congress
and
whether
that
other
benefits
clause
looks
only
to
the
time
when
the
serviceman
is
in
uniform,
but
i
think
it
was
necessary
to
the
decision
in
accardi
that
it
first
construe,
whether
the
benefit
was
an
aspect
of
seniority
and
then
as
the
district
court
had
done.
the
district
court
in
--
rather
the
court
of
appeals
in
accardi
said,
“yes,
we
find
that
there
is
an
aspect
of
seniority,
but
we
find
it
is
taken
away
by
the
other
benefits
clause”,
and
the
court
in
accardi
said,
“we
find
it
is
a
benefit
of
seniority
and
we
find
that
once
that
conclusion
is
reached,
the
other
benefits
clause
cannot
come
in
and
carve
out
an
exception.
the
other
benefits
clause
is
intended
only
to
add
things,
not
to
take
away
things.”
so,
in
that
sense
i
submit
it
was
not
dicta
and
the
court’s
inquiry
must
first
be
to
the
seniority
clause
and
we
believe
in
this
case
that
having
made
that
inquiry,
that
the
court
should
conclude
that
the
pension
plan
is
an
aspect
of
seniority,
we
recognize
that
if
the
court
finds
it
necessary
to
fall
back
on
that
second
clause,
mr.
davis
loses
because
the
company
does
not
extend
pension
benefits
to
employees
on
leave
of
absence.
but
it
is
very
definitely,
the
first
inquiry
must
be
to
the
seniority
clause.
except
i
thought
we
agreed
yesterday
that
the
second
clause
does
not
literally
apply
in
this
case
because
there
was
no
plan
in
effect
at
the
time
mr.
davis
was
inducted
in
the
armed
forces.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
not
the
only
way
to
read
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
my
question
was
simply
directed
to
the
proposition
that
if
there
was
no
plan
in
effect
at
the
time
he
went
into
the
armed
forces,
then
this
second
section
is
wholly
inapplicable
and
you
have
to
look
to
the
other
sections.
unknown
speaker
then
this
second
protection
does
not
by
its
terms
apply.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ryan
does
your
argument,
the
coverage
get
any
quote
out
of
c2
the
declaration
by
congress
that
honors
restoration
needs
restored
in
such
manner
as
to
give
him
such
status
in
his
employment
as
he
would
have
enjoyed
if
he
had
continued
in
such
employment?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
can
still
be
a
compensation
because
the
compensation
would
be
that
you
get
benefit
through
the
remainder
of
your
life,
however
long
it
is
and
that
is
rather
standard.
unknown
speaker
the
compensation
would
be
that
you
get
the
benefits,
retire
benefits
for
the
remainder
of
your
life
and
some
people
live
longer
than
others,
that
is
the
same
basic
compensation
is
the
assurance
of
benefits
for
the
remainder
of
your
life.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is…
unknown
speaker
but
is
that
argument
not
based
on
the
proposition
that
at
the
time
they
put
the
plan
in
effect,
whatever
year
that
was…
unknown
speaker
the
actuaries
looked
up
the
number
of
employees
and
the
precise
age
of
those
employees
and
their
years
of
service
and
out
of
that
amalgam,
constructed
an
actuarial
basis
for
the
plan.
but
they
could
not
--
they
claim,
include
him
and
if
there
were
ten
others
like
him
could
not
include
those
in
the
same
category
simply
because
there,
he
was
not
an
employee
at
the
time.
unknown
speaker
but
with
no
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
company
whether
he
would
ever
come
back
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
to
work
to
get
the
benefits
normally
apart
from…
