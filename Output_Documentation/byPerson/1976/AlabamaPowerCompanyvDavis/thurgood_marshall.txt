justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
other
case
76-451,
alabama
power
against
davis
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
we
granted
the
writ
in
this
case
to
resolve
another
conflict
among
the
circuits
over
the
question
of
whether
veterans
who
have
returned
the
jobs
with
private
employers
following
their
military
service
are
entitled
to
credit
toward
their
private
pensions
for
the
time
they
spent
in
military
service.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
below
held
that
the
respondent,
davis,
a
veteran,
is
entitled
to
such
credit
under
section
9
of
the
military
selective
service
act.
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
affirmed.
we
conclude
that
pensions
are
an
incident
of
seniority
because
they
are
in
the
nature
of
a
reward
for
length
of
service.
as
an
incident
of
seniority,
they
must,
under
the
act,
be
given
to
the
veteran
as
if
they
had
been
no
break
in
his
private
employment.
