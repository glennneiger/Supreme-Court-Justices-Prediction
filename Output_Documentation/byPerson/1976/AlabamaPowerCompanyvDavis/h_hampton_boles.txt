mr.
h.
hampton
boles
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
asked
for
a
period
of
rebuttal,
so
i
will
represent
the
first
portion
of
my
argument.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
alabama
power
company
in
this
cause,
who
is
the
appellant.
alabama
power
company
is
an
electric
public
utility
engaged
in
the
service
of
electricity
to
consumers
in
portions
of
the
state
of
alabama.
except
for
a
two-and-one-half
year
period
of
time
in
the
military
and
a
period
off
for
a
union
strike,
mr.
davis
was
employed
by
alabama
power
company
from
1936
until
his
retirement
in
1971.
according
to
the
provisions
of
the
pension
plan
of
alabama
power
company,
mr.
davis’
time
in
the
military
was
not
considered
as
a
credit
in
computing
the
amount
of
mr.
davis’
retirement
income.
mr.
davis
is,
to
the
litigation
through
the
u.s.
attorney’s
office,
alleging
that
alabama
power
company,
notwithstanding
the
contrary
provisions
of
its
pension
plan,
was
required
to
count
the
two-and-one-half
year
period
as
accredited
service
with
the
company
in
computing
the
amount
of
retirement
income
under
the
pension
plan.
the
district
court
in
alabama
ruled
in
favor
of
mr.
davis,
reasoning
that
since
the
alabama
power
company’s
plan
did
not
have
a
precise
matching
of
units
of
work
to
units
of
benefit
under
the
plan
that
the
benefit
was
like
seniority
and,
therefore,
his
military
time
must
be
counted
as
accredited
service
under
the
plan.
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
per
curium
with
one
dissenting
opinion,
and
this
court
accepted
cert.
now,
although
the
monthly
monetary
amount
involved
in
mr.
davis’
claim
is
not
very
great,
this
case
presents
to
this
court
for
the
first
time
the
precise
issue
of
the
proper
treatment
of
military-service
time
under
the
reemployment
provisions
of
the
military
selective
service
act.
the
facts
below
were
not
disputed
and
are
set
forth
as
agreed
statement
of
facts
beginning
at
about
page
15
in
the
appendix.
now,
we
believe
that
this
case
is
in
a
posture
to
be
decided
upon
three
fundamental
propositions
which
we
believe
to
exist
with
respect
to
the
reemployment
provisions
of
military
selective
service
act.
now,
first
of
all,
we
do
not
contest
nor
dispute
that
the
military
selective
service
act,
that
is,
the
reemployment
provisions
of
that
act,
were
enacted
to
benefit
the
veteran.
primarily
they
were
enacted
and
dictate
that
a
qualifying
veteran,
upon
his
return
to
private
employment,
must
be
employed
without
loss
of
seniority
and
must
be
entitled
to
participate
in
insurance
and
other
benefits
that
exist
in
accordance
with
established
rules
of
the
employer
as
they
relate
to
employees
on
leave
or
furlough
of
absence.
now,
the
second
proposition
which
we
have
no
contest
about
and
we
do
not
question
is,
if
there
is
an
employee
benefit
or
any
type
of
an
employee
advancement
which
accrues
automatically
by
virtue
of
continued
association
with
an
employer
alone
by
virtue
of
that
time
period,
then
the
veteran
must
have
his
military
service
time
count
toward
accruing
that
benefit.
the
third
proposition,
which
we
say
is
well-founded
in
law
and
applies
to
this
case,
is
that
if
the
employer
agreement
has
in
it
a
work
requirement
that
is
a
condition
to
that
benefit,
then
that
work
requirement
must
be
satisfied
by
the
employee,
regardless
of
whether
he
is
a
returning
veteran
or
just
a
returning
employee
from
leave
of
absence
before
the
employee
becomes
entitled
to
that
benefit.
now,
it's
alabama
power
company’s
position
in
this
case
that
accredited
service
under
its
pension
plan
can
only
be
earned
when
one
of
its
employees
works
for
the
company.
it
is
our
position
that
that
work
requirement
is
real;
it
requires
the
employee
to
be
present
on
the
job
earning
regular
pay.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
agree
that
it
should
be
open
and
shut,
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
case
should
be
very
simple.
it
is
clear
that
an
employee
on
leave
of
absence
without
regular
pay
receives
no
benefit
under
the
pension
plan.
he
gets
no
credit
for
accredited
service
under
the
minimum
pay
provisions
of
computing
income;
he
gets
absolutely
not
one
day
of
earnings.
as
i
want
to
go
into,
there
are
two
provisions
in
the
plan,
both
computing
pension
pay,
and
they
are
set
forth
in
section
5
of
the
pension
plan
beginning
at
about
page
60.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
mr.
chief
justice,
it
would
be
set
aside
on
an
actuarial
basis.
and
i
do
not
proclaim
to
understand
when
it
is
done;
but
it
is
set
aside
on
an
actuarial
basis,
and
there
is
no
segregation
of
the
fund
per
employee,
if
i
answered
your
question.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
yes,
sir.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
and
you
may
have
--
yes,
sir.
i
cannot
answer
that
question
within
any
degree
of
certainty;
but
i
do
know
that
it
has
done
as
frequent
as
is
necessary
through
accounting
procedures
to
maintain
the
plan
on
a
sound
actuarial
basis,
and
they
do
take
this
into
account,
yes,
sir.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
if
you
are
speaking
about
section
404
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
which
states
that
payments
into
the
pension
fund
are
deductible
in
the
year
in
which
they
are
made,
it
is
my
understanding
under
the
theory
that
they
are
a
type
of
compensation
to
the
employee
and
then
the
employee
gets
them
as
deferred
compensation
and
they
become
taxable
to
him
in
the
year
of
receipt
and
taxable
to
the
employer
in
the
year
that
it
has
given,
yes,
sir.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
i
believe
in
the
agreed
statement
of
facts,
it
does,
your
honor.
it
states
that
the
fund
was
not
funded
to
account
for
periods
of
absence
on
military
leave,
yes,
sir.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
absolutely
not,
there
is
no
certainty.
when
an
employee
leaves
to
go
into
military,
he
does
not
have
any
type
of
contract
which
binds
him
to
return
to
the
employer.
that
is
his
free
election.
if
he
returns
within
the
time
period
that
is
specified
in
the
statute,
i
believe
90
days,
the
employer
has
to
accept
him.
there
is
further
no
requirement
that
once
he
returns
that
he
stay
any
length
of
time;
i
mean,
he
can
return,
stay
a
day
and
leave.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
that
is
correct.
that
is
true
if
a
person
goes
on
leave
of
absence,
say
to
take
his
own
time
without
pay
to
go
two
years
of
college,
we
do
not
fund
the
plan
there,
either,
for
him.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
your
honor,
that
is
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
as
great
seniority
for
time,
i
cannot
state
exactly
whether
the
union
allows
him
to
accumulate
seniority.
i
can
state
that
with
respect
to
the
pension
plan,
he
does
not
earn
not
a
red
cent.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
i
can
state
that
the
record
refers
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreements.
it
is
absolutely
clear
in
those
agreements
that
military
service
time
does
count
toward
seniority
for
those
types
of
things
such
as
layoff
and
job
preference.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
it
is
my
understanding,
mr.
chief
burger,
that
it
is
not
funded
to
account
for
prolonged
leaves
of
absence.
now,
you
do
not
get
credit
on
leaves
of
absence
for
sickness
under
the
pension
plan
in
excess
of
30
days
except
for
the
one
occasion
that
is
mentioned
in
the
stipulated
facts
where
if
an
individual
has
over
20
years'
service
and
he
faces
that
situation
that
the
company
can
in
its
discretion
grant
extended
sick
leave.
in
that
case,
if
he
has
granted
sick
leave
with
pay,
it
is
funded.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
there
is
no
contract
to
--
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
it
is
noncontributory
plan,
but
we
--
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
in
mr.
davis’
case,
we
did
have
--
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
no,
sir.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
i
do
not
think
so,
sir.
under
section
5,
the
basic
normal
retirement
income
computation
is
a
percent
of
earnings,
totally
a
percent
of
earnings.
there
is
nothing
else
in
there
but
a
percentage.
it
is
an
extremely
long
and
complicated
formula
i
guess
we
do
in
pension
plans,
but
they
take
one
percent
of
his
earnings
up
to
a
certain
step
and
then
a
greater
percent
of
earnings.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
you
do
not
unless
--
that
is
a
minimum
pay
formula.
let
me
try
to
explain
that,
because
that
is
important
to
my
case.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
it
also
does
not
--
there
are
two
--
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
that
is
one
reason.
you
could
get
it
even
under
...
we
do
not
count
it
for
earnings.
the
basic
provision
under
the
plan
in
section
5
for
computing
the
amount
of
retirement
income
is
that
you
take
a
percent
of
earnings
and
add
them
up,
that
is
all.
then
we
have
a
minimum
pay,
minimum
retirement
pay
section,
which
is
also
in
section
5,
that
was
introduced
by
amendment
in
1966
that
does
take
into
account
accredited
service.
basically,
that
section
says
you
take
a
percent
of
his
earnings
on
retirement
and
multiply
it
times
his
accredited
service.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
that
is
absolutely
correct,
we
do
not.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
we
do
not.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
that
is
why
you
have
this
specific
case.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
i
agree,
and
those
persons
do
not
get
credit
under
the
pension
plan,
not
by
way
of
accredited
service
nor
by
way
of
earnings
under
the
first
section.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
are
you
speaking
of
the
returning
veteran?
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
if
it
is
nonunion-related,
it
is
my
understanding
that
they
do
not;
but
the
veteran
does,
i
mean,
the
specific
veteran
does.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
yes,
sir.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
exactly.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
exactly,
with
regard
to
seniority
it
can
require
a
preference
for
the
veteran.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
i
do
not
deny
that
if
a
benefit
is
a
function
of
seniority
that
you
have
to
give
it
to
the
returning
veteran.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
we
are
in
complete
agreement.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
and
earning
regular
pay,
and
that
is
present
as
a
full-time
regular
employee;
that's
one
that
works
40
hours
a
week
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
that
is
the
one
that
--
and
the
test
there
is
what
the
plan
provides
for
employees
on
furlough
or
leave
of
absence.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
the
plan
provides
that
they
will
not
receive
accredited
service
when
they
are
on
furlough
or
leave
of
absence.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
this
plan
was
adopted
after
he
went
into
the
service.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
he
absolutely
does.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
according
to
the
reading
of
the
statute,
it
does
not
apply.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
that
is
right.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
one
year,
and
the
veteran
--
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
yes,
sir;
and
i
will
point
out
now
here
the
distinction
is
that
with
that
one-year
qualifying
period
under
the
plan,
we
do
not
have
a
work
requirement;
you
just
have
to
maintain
a
status
of
an
employee/employer
for
one
year.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
it
would
affect
the
dollars
received
and
would
not
affect
his
eligibility.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
yes,
sir.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
i
do,
sir,
yes,
sir.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
i
think
that
you
can
look
at
it
...
you
are
talking
about
past
service
under
the
plan,
and
in
that
particular
section
it
also
has
an
accredited
service
part
of
the
formula.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
not
--
he
had
no
legal
claim
before
the
plan,
and
his
only
claim
is
by
virtue
of
the
plan,
that
is
right.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
and
that
is
one
of
the
points
here
that
i
have
got
is
that
i
think
you
have
got
to
look
at
the
plan
in
order
to
determine
what
benefit
at
all
that
mr.
davis
may
have
been
entitled
to,
and
it
is
our
contention
that
he
got
anything
that
he
earned
and
we
properly
exclude
--
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
what
i
would
like
to
do
in
reply
in
my
remaining
time
is
a
place
i
will
case
in
perspective
in
view
of
the
government's
argument
and
the
government
has
basically
ordered
that
this
case,
that
pension
rights
should
be
determined
of
the
seniority
in
a
sort
of
a
general
sense
without
dependent
upon
the
provisions
of
our
pension
plan.
we
say
that
you
cannot
divorce
the
amount
of
pension
paid
which
is
in
dispute
here
from
the
provisions
of
the
very
agreement
from
which
that
right
arises.
the
government
in
its
brief
apparently
realizing
the
fallacy
of
its
argument
says
that
you
cannot
have
a
pension
plan
which
is
not
dependent
upon
seniority.
if
you
have
a
precise
100%
correlation
between
units
of
work
to
units
of
benefit
we
say
that
this
court
in
foster
said
that
although
the
work
requirement
correlates
only
loosely
with
the
benefit
if
it
has
a
work
requirement,
which
our
plan
very
definitely
has,
that
that
is
not
sufficient
to
invoke
the
statutory
guarantee.
now,
with
reference
to
some
of
the
questions
that
have
been
raised,
i
will
point
out
that
on
page
17
of
the
agreed
statement
of
fact,
it
is
17
of
the
appendix,
it
explains
somewhat
how
the
pension
plan
is
funded
and
it
says
that
the
amount
of
contribution
is
determined
annually,
and
also
in
response
to
a
question
yesterday,
if
we
have
stipulated,
as
counsel
for
the
government
has
said
that
the
employees
of
alabama
power
company
on
leave
of
absence
were
treated
exactly
the
same
as
employees
on
leave
of
absence
for
military
service
with
respect
to
determining
the
amount
of
pay
due
under
the
pension
plan.
there
has
been
no
discrimination
against
the
veteran.
on
our
plan
he
has
been
paid
for
everything
that
he
earned.
what
is
important
here
is
we
go
back
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
analysis
of
the
section
yesterday.
the
section
says
three
things
that
you
will
be
given
your
seniority
when
you
return,
that
you
will
be
given
other
benefits
and
insurance
when
you
return
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
the
employee
in
effect
when
you
left
relating
to
other
employees
on
leave
of
absence,
and
that
you
will
not
be
terminated
within
one
year,
and
mr.
davis
was
not
fired,
mr.
davis
although,
the
statute
literally
did
not
say
that
he
has
to
be
given
rights.
we
do
not
have
to
rely
there,
may
it
please
you
mr.
justice
stewart,
on
that
section
if
you
take
it
out,
take
his
rights
out
by
virtue
of
fact
that
we
did
not
have
a
plan
in
1943.
he
did
not
gain
any
other
rights,
but
even
if
he
did,
even
if
we
accept
the
argument
that
we
have
to
give
him
the
rights
equal
to
other
employees
this
we
have
stipulated
we
have
done.
so,
i
say
that
he
cannot
get
any
rights
there.
now,
the
government
criticizes
us
for
not
having
a
precise
correlation
between
units
of
work
and
units
of
benefit,
and
we
say
the
law
does
require
that.
we
do
not
give
credit,
we
do
not
give
credit
for
overtime
as
earnings,
we
also
do
not
count
an
hourly
credit
under
the
plan
as
accredited
service
for
overtime.
we
say
that
we
do
not
have
to
do
that,
that
even
though
we
do
not
do
that,
it
does
not
somehow
create
seniority
out
of
a
plan
that
is
founded
upon
work.
all
the
time
that
my
opposing
counsel
was
up
here,
we
were
talking
about
actual
work
and
automatic
benefits.
when
you
speak
of
seniority
and
i
am
not
saying
you
have
to
take
the
most
narrow
deal
of
seniority
to
determine
this
case
in
our
favor,
you
generally
have
to
have
two
things
and
that
is
names
of
employees
and
dates
that
they
were
with
this
company,
then
you
can
start
pairing
down
to
make
your
decisions.
you
do
not
have
to
have
the
earnings
of
that
employee,
you
do
not
have
to
say
that
that
employee
had
to
be
a
fulltime
regular
employee
working
40
hours
a
week.
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
time.
now,
it
is
not
true,
absolutely
not
true
that
all
our
plan
requires
is
that
you
have
a
status
as
an
employee
in
order
to
gain
benefits.
certainly,
you
do
gain
some
benefits
and
we
described
those
yesterday.
you
get
time
for
(inaudible)
because
that
is
only
time
we
are
related,
you
get
time
for
the
one-year
qualification,
but
there
is
no
way
simply
by
being
on
the
payroll
unless
if
payroll
is
described
as
a
status
of
an
employee
to
the
employer
that
you
can
gain
one
cent
under
the
plan
without
being
a
full
time
regular
employee
working
40
hours
a
week
on
a
fulltime
basis.
so,
we
say
that
we
have
followed
that,
we
have
followed
that
in
1937,
it
is
good
now
and
that
our
pension
plan
requires
a
work
requirement
and
it
should
be
upheld
by
the
court
that
for
some
reason
and
now
there
seems
to
be
some
criticism
because
in
1966
we
granted
a
veteran
something
over
and
above
the
normal
employee.
now,
this
is
exactly
what
the
government
has
done
in
some
of
its
own
retirement
plans
that
it
has
gone
up,
in
specific,
i
am
talking
about
the
railroad
retirement
act.
it
also
excludes
military
service
from
years
of
service
under
that
act
except
those
portions
which
were
very
narrowly
defined
as
wartime
service,
and
i
would
say,
not
only
--
if
the
government
had
intended
to
define
seniority
in
a
broad
way
for
purposes
of
the
military
selective
service
act
it
certainly
should
have
abided
by
it
in
the
railroad
retirement
act,
which
it
did
not
and
that
is
in
45
u.
s.
c.
section
231
i
think.
with
that
your
honor
we
say
that
our
pension
plan
embodies
a
very
distinct,
very
apparent
work
requirement.
you
have
to
be
on
a
payroll,
you
also
have
to
be
earning
and
it
should
not
be
assumed
by
the
court
that
a
utility
or
any
other
corporation
can
have
employees
that
are
gaining
benefits
as
a
fulltime
regular
employee
and
being
paid
without
doing
their
work.
that
simply
is
not
practical,
it
is
not
what
happens,
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
that
is
what
happens.
you
have
work
to
be
paid
except
of
course,
for
the
normal
things
like
vacations,
but
we
say
he
has
earned
that,
we
say
mr.
davis
earned
his
pension
plan
--
excuse
me.
he
earned
his
pension
pay
that
was
computed
in
exactly
the
way
the
plan
calls
for
and
he
is
not
entitled
to
have
any
extra
pay
imputed
or
required
because
of
his
two
and
one
half
years
in
the
military.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
that
is
right.
mr.
h.
hampton
boles
your
analysis
is
exactly
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
we
admit
that,
there
is
evident
in
the
plan
but
all
we
are
saying
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
law
and
no
case
before
this
court
that
requires
a
type
of
precision
between
units
of
work
and
units
of
benefit
that
has
been
asked
and
asserted
by
the
government.
i
do
not
know
that
it
would
be
administrable.
i
suppose
you
could
do
it
with
computers
to
keep
up
with
the
minute
by
minute,
hour
by
hour.
we
say
that
we
have
got
a
very
practical,
logical,
realistic
plan
and
it
is
dependant
upon
work
and
we
ask
that
the
lower
judgment
be
reversed.
thank
you.
