chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
76-451,
alabama
power
against
davis.
if
it
will
assist
you
in
making
your
plans,
gentlemen,
we
will
hear
the
petitioner’s
argument
this
afternoon
and
the
respondent’s
in
the
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
set
aside
every
month
,
every
quarter
or
annually?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
must
be
at
fairly
frequent
intervals
to
take
into
account
people
who
either
leave
or
take
long-term
sick
leave,
must
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
would
be
tax
problems
involved
there,
too,
would
there
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
when
he
is
on
military
leave,
then
does
this
record
show
whether
the
company
made
any
contributions
for
this
particular
man?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
one
reason
for
that,
i
suppose
among
many
others,
is
that
there
is
no
certainty
that
the
particular
employee
is
going
to
come
back.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
a
matter
of
contract,
though,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
position,
if
i
take
it,
is
the
function
of
seniority
is
not
to
be
equated
with
contributions
by
the
employer
into
a
fund
during
a
period
when
the
person
is
not
present
in
the
establishment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
more
than
rights
to
reemployment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
you
say
with
respect
to
a
plan,
a
pension
plan,
that
as
to
this
man
had
been
established
in
1960,
long
after
the
war,
long
after
he
had
returned?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ryan,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
equally
accurate
to
catch
that
in
terms
of
whether
there
has
been
compensation
paid
during
the
period
rather
than
whether
work
was
performed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then,
you
do
not
think
that
if
the
employer
paid
the
employee
during
all
the
period
he
was
in
the
service
as
some
employers
did,
that
the
contributions
to
the
pension
fund
would
follow
automatically?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
today
for
the
first
time,
the
employer
develops
a
pension
plan
that
was
contributory
not
one
of
the
kind
that
we
have
here
with
four
parts
paid
by
the
employer
and
one
part
by
the
employee
and
it
would
be
voluntary
in
the
sense
that
those
employees
who
did
not
want
to
make
the
back
payments
would
not
be
requiring
to
do
so?
for
simplicity,
$100
a
year
from
this
employee
would
be
required
for
each
year
if
he
was
employed.
do
you
say
he
would
be
exempted
from
payment
of
that
money
for
the
three
years
he
was
in
the
service?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
are
arguing
for
a
result
that
would
give
him
monetary
benefits
for
these
three
years,
are
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not,
just
status
on
the
payroll
in
terms
of
seniority,
but
money
in
the
fund
to
his
credit.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
no
evidence
there
in
a
sense
that
there
was
no
plan
in
effect
in
back
some
evidence
of
the
foreseeability?
there
was
no
plan
in
effect
when
he
left,
was
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
but
their
argument
as
i
understand
it
is,
that
it
would
be
unfair
now
to
tax
the
company
for
contributions
due
in
1944
and
1945.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
ryan.
and
mr.
boles,
you
have
some
time
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
marshall.
