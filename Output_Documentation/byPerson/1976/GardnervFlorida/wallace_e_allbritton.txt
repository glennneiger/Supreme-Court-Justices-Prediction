mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
preference
to
my
remarks
i’d
like
to
advice
the
court
that
i
have
somewhat
of
a
speech
impediments
so
if
any
time
i
mumble
or
the
court
does
not
understand
any
remark,
i
have
to
say,
please
let
me
know
and
i’ll
attempt
to
repeat
it.
if
the
court
please
in
woodson
v.
north
carolina,
this
court
struck
down
a
state
law
and
one
of
the
grounds
it
gave
was
because
this
law
failed
to
provide
for
the
particularized
consideration
of
relevant
aspects
of
the
character
and
record
of
the
defendant
affected
under
it.
the
court
went
on
to
remark
and
i
quote
very
briefly,
“justice
requires
consideration
of
the
character
and
propensities
of
the
offender.”
and
then
the
court
remarked
and
i
quote
again
very
briefly
a
comment
that
“this
is
a
constitutionally
indispensable
part
of
the
process
of
inflicting
the
penalty
of
death.
now
then
the
day
--
this
court
has
been
asked
to
receive
from
woodson
from
that
constitutional
principle
by
emasculating
a
provision
specifically
tailored
to
furnish
a
trial
judge
with
the
kind
of
information
that
this
court
said
was
constitutionally
required
before
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
i’d
like
digress
a
moment
about
as
to
how
this
case
got
here.
it
has
been
urged
that
counsel
didn’t
have
the
confidential
part
of
the
psi
report.
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
didn’t
have
it.
i’ll
tell
why
they
didn’t
have
it
is
because
trial
counsel
and
the
trial
court
didn’t
ask
for
it.
there
were
two
motions
for
a
new
trial
filed
in
the
trial
court
and
none
of
those
is
any
mention
made
that
the
trial
judge
erred
in
refusing
to
disclose
the
confidential
part
of
the
psi.
because
you
see,
if
it
had
been,
then
under
the
florida
rule,
the
psi
could
have
been
made
part
of
the
record
on
appeal
and
it
would
have
been
before
the
supreme
court
of
our
statute.
and
the
--
they
could've
reviewed
it
but
this
was
not
done,
not
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
you
misunderstand
the
rule
provides
that
a
trial
judge
may
disclose
all
of
it.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
if
he
so
deems
fit.
and
it
also
provides
that
when
the
pre-sentence
report
becomes
an
issue
that
it
can
be
included
and
it
can
be
reviewed
by
an
appellate
court,
but
this
was
not
done
and
that’s
why
the
supreme
court
didn’t
have
it
before
it.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
they
searched
everything
they
had
down
there.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes
sir,
i
think
so.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
don’t
think
that
it
can
because
it
was
not
made
an
issue.
there
was
no
mention
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
they
do
in
the
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
well,
it
is
because
they
just
didn’t
have
it
in
front
of
them
justice.
they
can’t
review
what’s
not
in
the
record
on
appeal.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
i
think
that’s
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes
it
is.
but
the
thing
is
argue
if
any,
to
say
that
they
knew
what
the
trial
judge
had.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
and
that
was
the
first
time
it
was
brought
up.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no
sir.
i
don’t
believe
it
does.
however,
i
add,
no
time
even
until
this
present
time
has
counsel,
any
counsel
made
any
demand
whatsoever
for
a
copy
of
the
confidential
apportion
of
the
psi.
so
i
took
the
liberty
of
attaching
it
as
the
appendix
to
my
brief
so
that
this
court
can
read
it.
the
counsel
says
he
doesn’t
believe
that’s
authentic.
well,
if
he
doesn’t,
i
have
an
authenticated
copy
here
and
if
he
wants
to
read
that,
he
can.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
they
can
justice
--
if
its
made
a
part
of
the
record
on
appeal,
they
can.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
deny
that
emphatically.
it
was
not
raised
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
it
was
commented
on
by
justice
ervin
in
his
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
that
your
honor
has
to
do
not
with
the
failure
of
the
trial
judge
to
disclose
the
confidential
aspect
of
the
psi.
he
is
arguing
there
that
the
trial
judge
erred
in
reviewing
the
psi,
you
know
at
all.
that
that’s
what
he’s
arguing.
that
is
a
general
assignment
and
it
does
not
deal
with
the
precise
issue
that
is
now
before
this
court.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
well,
i
know
it
does
and
in
the
brief
that
he
filed
into
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
he
mentions
but
not
in
the
context
that
it
was
error
for
the
trial
judge
not
to
disclose
and
particularly
so,
when
it
had
not
been
requested
by
the
defense
counsel.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
because
it
was
mentioned
in
the
brief
of
appellant
filed
in
the
florida
supreme
court.
but
again,
not
in
the
context
that
the
trial
judge
erred
in
failing
to
disclosed
or
refusing
to
disclose
the
confidential
aspect
of
the
psi.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
believe
sir
that
all
they
could
review
is
what's
before
them.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
that’s
a
hard
one
to
answer
because
it's
hard
to
say
that
they
have
a
duty
to
go
into
matters
that
is
not
before
them
that
no
point
has
been
raised
as
to
this
at
all.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
i
don’t
sir.
i
do
not.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
he
pointed
it
out
but
even
he
did
not
say
that
it
was
error
because
the
trial
judge
failed
or
refused
to
disclose
the
confidential
aspect
of
it.
he
just
mention
it
as
part
of
his
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
that
could
well
be.
i
can’t
argue
with
that
part.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
well,
if
that
terrible
event
occurs
then
i
think
it
should
go
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
with
directions
to
review
the
confidential
portion
of
the
psi
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
manners
and
things
in
there
that
should
have
been
disclosed
to
the
defendant
and
his
attorney
so
that
the
same
could
be
rebutted.
and
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
abused
his
discretionary
power
in
failing
to
disclose
it
in
the
absence
of
a
request
so
they
do.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
well,
it
is
discretionary.
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
under
the
rule.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
what's
wrong
with
that?
you
have
a
federal
rule
that’s
comparable
to
it.
federal
rule
of
32
(c)
provides
the
same
thing
for
our
federal
district
judge.
he
has
the
discretionary
power.
so
does
the
rule.
it
says
that
the
state
trial
judge
may
disclose
and
the
federal
rule
is
comparable
to
it.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
that’s
true.
it
hasn’t
but
has
--
there
are
many
cases
on
the
point
but
not
in
the
context
of
a
capital
case,
that’s
true.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
they
saw
it
and
evidently
didn’t
agree
with
it
at
all.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
and
they
didn’t
say
a
word
about
it.
absolutely
not.
they
evidently
that
the
trial
attorney
was
happy
with
the
way
things
was
in
the
trial
court
or
else
he
would've
made
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
well,
he
might
have
been
happy
about
that
but
he
thought
that
he
had
a
fair
trial
or
else
he
would've
enunciated
the
procedure
to
have
the
psi
set
up
to
the
florida
supreme
court
which
he
didn’t
do.
seems
as
though
my
time
is
gone,
i’ll
just
go
to
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
do?
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
alright
sir.
i
think
the
gravamen
of
petitioner’s
complaint
is
with
the
discretionary
power
that
is
given
to
the
state
court
trial
judges
to
withhold
certain
parts
of
the
pre-sentence
report
here.
well,
now,
if
he’s
arguing
abut
this,
to
me
he
is
arguing
against
the
entire
criminal
process
because
i
frankly
tell
this
court,
i
know
of
no
way
in
which
the
exercise
of
a
reason
to
judgment
can
be
cut
out
of
the
criminal
process.
its
in
it
from
beginning
to
the
end.
and
in
considering
the
responsibility
of
a
trial
judge
that
is
a
heavy
one.
i
think
all
of
us
will
agree
on
that.
and
particularly,
is
this
true
in
a
capital
case?
so
then,
in
the
exercise
of
this
awesome
responsibility
i
say
to
this
court
that
trial
judges
need
help.
they
need
all
the
help
they
can
get.
and
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
pre-sentence
report,
is
to
give
trial
judges
the
kind
of
help
that
this
court
said
in
woodson,
was
constitutionally
required.
that
is
to
learn
about
the
character
and
the
propensities
of
the
defendant.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
absolutely
not.
there’s
not
a
thing
in
there
that
in
my
opinion
that
would
keep
the
trial
judge
from
disclosing
the
entire
psi,
nothing.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
don’t
know
why
he
didn’t
do
it.
i
--
absolutely
not
--
but
going
to
that
too,
the
trial
judge
didn’t
say
that
he
relied
on
the
confidential
part
of
the
psi
that
there
were
things
in
there
that
inflamed
him
and
therefore
consequently
he
imposed
the
death
penalty.
that
is
just
wrong,
that’s
all.
he
didn’t
do
it.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
he
did,
the
whole
thing.
and
the
major
part
of
it,
defense
counsel
had
the
things
that
could
have
been
controverted.
he
had
those.
it
was
only
the
things
that
you
need
the
protection
of
confidentiality
to
help
a
judge.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
well,
if
he
said
it
to
the
probation
officer,
it
must
be
accurate
then.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no
sir.
there
are
things
in
the
confidential
part
that
are
not
in
the
public
part,
that’s
true.
but
i
say
to
you
there
isn’t
anything
in
there
that
required
the
trial
judge
to
disclose
it
to
him
at
all.
there
hadn’t
been
anything
in
there
that’s
inflammatory
that
would
prejudice
the
trial
judge.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes
i
do
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
restate
the
fact
that
under
both
the
state
rule
and
the
federal
rule,
it
is
discretionary
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge
as
to
whether
or
not
he
will
disclose
the
confidential
aspect
of
the
pre-sentence
report.
now,
then
the
question
would
come
up,
what
would
be
the
harm
in
mandatory
disclosure
of
this
confidential
part
of
the
psi?
what
harm
would
it
do?
i
say,
in
much
every
way
because
first
and
foremost,
it
would
dry
up
the
sources
of
information
which
comprises
from
which
the
confidential
part
of
the
psi
is
made
up.
that
report
then
would
become
nothing
more
than
a
mere
abstract
of
public
records
and
then
no
longer
would
the
trial
judge
have
the
benefit
of
the
kind
of
information
that
this
court
said
was
constitutionally
required
in
order
to
help
him
discharge
his
responsibility
in
the
sentencing
procedure.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
woodson
v.
north
carolina.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
it
involves
the
statute.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
it
involved
the
statute
too,
i
know,
the
jury,
yes.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
that’s
true.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
whatever
kind
it
was,
still
the
judge
has
to
have
it.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes
it
is.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes
sir.
let’s
think
about
this
for
a
minute.
in
securing
information
upon
which
to
prosecute
a
crime,
a
prosecuting
attorney
relies
on
immunity
in
order
to
get
people
to
testify
in
front
of
a
grand
jury
thus
immunity
is
a
tool
that
he
uses
to
get
the
information
that
he
needs.
just
so
then,
i
say
that
confidentiality
is
the
tool
that
the
judge
can
use
in
getting
the
needed
information
to
ensure
that
a
just
punishment
is
meted
out
to
a
wrong
doer.
but
even
then,
in
the
exercise
of
the
discretion,
if
the
trial
judge
feels
that
the
confidential
aspect
of
the
psi
is
of
such
gravity,
he
can
in
the
exercise
of
his
discretion,
disclose
it
to
the
defense
attorney
so
that
he
may
rebut
it
if
he
can.
but
petitioner
here
says
--
he
says
not
so.
when
a
trial
judge
exercises
his
discretion
against
disclosure,
it
is
contended
before
this
court
that
this,
ipso
facto
constitutes
a
denial
of
due
process.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
premise
that
must
undergo
such
an
argument
as
that
is
that
trial
judges
are
simply
incapable
of
separating
the
wheat
from
the
chaff
when
reading
the
psi
and
thus
whenever
the
discretion
is
exercised,
against
disclosure
automatically
this
results
in
a
due
process,
a
denial
of
due
process.
now
i
deny
this.
i
can’t
subscribe
to
that.
i
do
not
impute
that
degree
of
unfairness
or
lack
of
impartiality
or
lack
of
humanity
to
the
trial
judges.
now,
getting
to
williams
v.
new
york,
mr.
justice
black
said
it
better
than
i
can
when
writing
for
a
majority
of
this
court
and
he
said,
i
quote
his
words,
“the
due
process
clause
should
not
be
treated
as
a
devise
for
freezing
the
evidential
procedure
of
sentencing
in
the
mold
of
trial
procedure.”
but
now
it
maybe
urged
well,
look,
this
is
a
capital
case.
we
throw
all
that
aside
in
a
capital
case.
well,
this
court
rejected
that
argument
in
williams
v.
new
york.
and
again,
very
briefly
i’d
like
to
read
and
i
quote,
“it
is
urged
however
that
we
should
draw
a
constitutional
distinction
as
to
the
procedure
for
obtaining
information
where
the
death
sentence
is
imposed.
we
cannot
accept
the
contention.”
it’s
the
words
of
this
court.
and
on
down,
i
quote
again,
“we
cannot
say
that
the
due
process
clause
renders
a
sentence
void
merely
because
out
of
court
information,
excuse
me,
void
merely
because
a
judge
gets
additional
out
of
court
information
to
assist
him
in
the
exercise
of
this
awesome
power
of
imposing
the
death
penalty
or
sentence.”
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no
sir.
i
don’t
agree
with
that.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
well,
justice
stevens,
i
didn’t
read
it
the
same
you
did
it
because
the
way
i
read
the
case,
it
was
not
disclosed
to
the
defendant
or
his
attorney
and
they
claim
before
this
court
that
that
constituted
a
denial
of
due
process
and
this
court
said,
absolutely
not.
and
i
say
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
woodson
is
a
implicit
reaffirmance
of
the
principle
of
williams
v.
new
york.
i
agree
with
this
court
when
it
said
in
proffitt
and
i
quote
again
very
shortly,
“it
is
no
longer
true
that
there
is
no
meaningful
basis
for
distinguishing
the
few
cases
in
which
the
death
penalty
is
imposed
from
the
many
cases
where
it
is
not
--
now,
this
is
a
simple
truth
is,
if
truth
can
be
ever
be
simple
that
the
pre-sentence
report
is
one
of
the
key
instruments
used
in
providing
such
a
meaningful
basis
that
this
court
referred
to
in
proffitt.
i
cannot
subscribe
that
in
each
and
every
instance
no
matter
what
the
case
when
a
trial
judge
exercises
his
discretion
not
to
disclose
the
confidential
aspects
of
a
psi
that
this
ipso
facto
constitutes
a
denial
of
due
process.
this
court
repudiated
that
in
williams
and
the
only
way
i
know
of
to
get
around
it
is
to
(voice
overlap)
from
that.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
well,
in
the
case
that
we
are
thinking
about
now,
the
judge
read
all
of
the
pre-sentence
report
and
--
(voice
overlap).
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
ithink
that
was
based
on
what
he
heard
at
the
sentencing
(voice
overlap).
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
well,
if
we’re
going
to
suppose
that
then,
trial
counsel,
if
he
knows
his
way
in
and
out
of
the
court
is
going
to
require
that
the
confidential
part
be
disclosed
and
if
refuses
to
do
that,
he
can
have
it
put
in
to
transcript
on
the
record
on
appeal
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
that’s
right.
that’s
exactly
and
he
found
that
from
the
things
that
were
produced
at
trial
and
at
the
sentencing
phase.
he
did
not
say
that
he
relied
on
the
psi
at
all.
as
i
read
his
findings
of
fact
and
i
think
my
strongest
point
here
is
that
ever
since
the
beginning
of
the
psi,
trial
judges
all
over
the
country
and
this
court
have
found
it
very
proper
to
withhold
the
disclosure
of
--
sometimes
all
and
at
least
part
of
the
confidential
aspects
of
the
psi.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
well,
there
are
some
people
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
that’s
true
but
i
think
i
speak
for
the
majority
that
they
regard
the
decision
to
disclose
or
not
as
discretionary
with
the
trial
judge
and
when
he
doesn’t
disclose,
it
does
not
constitute
a
denial
of
due
process.
let
me
sum
up
by
saying
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
think
it
does.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
yes.
if
someone
wanted
to
kill
me,
i
have
a
20
year
son
at
home,
that
would
be
pretty
angry
about
that
particularly
if
he
found
out
that
someone
put
out
a
bad
word
on
me.
yes.
the
fear
of
retaliation
is
there.
the
fear
of
the
stigma
in
the
community
of
being
a
stupid.
of
course
it's
there.
people
will
talk
when
they
know
that
what
they
state
is
going
to
be
held
in
confidentiality.
that’s
the
reason
for
it.
but
people
are
not
going
to
talk
to
a
probation
officer
when
they
know
that
they’re
liable
to
have
to
come
in
to
court
and
repeat
it
and
what
they
say
then
will
become
public.
now,
that’s
common
sense.
i
think
all
of
us
would
admit
that,
i
hope
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
not
expressly
no
--
he
relied
that
among
other
things
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
not
in
total,
no
sir.
that
among
other
things,
i
can’t
say
that
you
relied
on
the
confidential
part
of
it
and
it
doesn’t
say
so
and
what
--
he
just
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
he
did
take
it.
that’s
the
purpose
of
it
sir.
that’s
the
purpose.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
thank
you.
