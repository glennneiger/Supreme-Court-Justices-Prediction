justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
what
point
in
the
florida
courts
did
you
raise
this
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
your
appeal,
from
what?
the
district
court
of
appeal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
made
it
in
your
opening
brief
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
this
is
the
per
curiam
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
it
doesn’t
even
deal
with
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
your
contention
anyway
that
you
adequately
raised
it
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
so
that
under
florida
procedure
they
would
have
to
consider
it?
do
they
have
to
consider
some
that
you
didn’t
raise
before
the
trial
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
any
error
that
you
adequately
raised
in
your
brief,
they
must
consider
under
florida
practice.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
couldn’t
have
made
a
motion
for
a
new
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don’t
claim
there
was
any
defect
in
the
sentencing
proceeding
before
the
jury,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
should
there
be
any
sentencing
proceeding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
this
court
ever
in
a
state
proceeding
said
that
if
a
case
would
have
to
go
back
for
retrial
or
re-sentencing
before
a
different
judge.
i
realize
that
on
occasion,
court
of
appeals
in
a
federal
system
have
said
that
in
the
case
of
a
district
judge.
but
has
federal
court
ever
said
that
in
the
case
what
we
are
reviewing
in
a
state
proceeding.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what?
