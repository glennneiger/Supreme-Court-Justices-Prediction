justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
where
do
you
say
that
is
in
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
perhaps,
are
you
going
to
address
any
of
this
as
information
that
you
might
have
tested
and
you
had
it
at
the
time
of
sentences
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
my
question
was
though,
are
there
content,
is
the
content
here,
had
you
had
it
at
the
--
been
given
to
you
at
the
time
the
sentencing
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
you
might
have
introduced
evidence
to
contest,
that’s
my
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see,
are
you
--
you
could
tell
us
what
that
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
my
question
is,
could
they
have
used
this
report,
would
that
be
enough
or
would
there
had
to
be
some
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
what
i’m
trying
to
get
at,
what
would
they
have
had
to
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
understand
how
this
florida
procedure
works.
after
the
verdict
of
guilt,
then
the
jury
is
assembled
again
for
a
sentencing
procedure,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
an
adversary
hearing
of
course
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
then,
after
--
then
the
jury
goes
out
and
it
return
it's
recommendation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
what’s
the
proceeding
before
the
judge
after
the
jury’s
recommendation
of
life?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
hearing
of
any
kind?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
when
they
asked
counsel,
do
you
have
anything
to
say,
counsel,
well,
what
you’ve
given
us,
i
would
like
to
offer
some
evidence
opposed
to
as
much
as
you
have
given
us.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
he
have
done
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
there
is
a
florida
procedure
call
for
that
before
the
judge
actually
imposed
a
sentence.
an
opportunity
to
defense
-–
to
meet
anything
that
is
turned
over
after
the
jury's
recommendations
are
turned.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
how
about
a
[laughter]
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
florida
(voice
overlap)
does
not
require
or
even
give
an
adversary
hearing
before
the
judge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that’s
the
point,
isn’t
it?
in
the
case
of
tedder
against
state,
at
least
the
opinion
of
the
three
members
of
the
court
relied
on
in
upholding
this
procedure
and
proffitt
against
florida.
an
opinion
relied
upon
the
florida
decision
of
tedder
against
state
which
said
that
in
order
to
sustain
a
sentence
of
death
following
a
jury
recommendation
of
life,
the
facts
suggesting
a
sentence
of
death
should
be
so
clear
and
convincing
that
virtually
no
reasonable
person
could
“differ.”
and
i’m
quoting
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
it
was
upon
that
proposition
among
others
that
three
members
of
the
court
here
relied
in
upholding
the
florida
system.
and
also
upon
the
related
proposition
that
this
would
all
be
reviewed
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
that
there
would
be
an
opportunity
for
--
to
answer
on
the
defendants
part
to
and
to
argue
to
the
sentencing
authority
the
ultimate
sentencing
authority,
the
effect
of
those
facts.
that
was
entirely
denied
here,
wasn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
the
supreme
court
of
florida
have
the
confidential
--
even
the
supreme
court
of
florida
have
the
confidential
part
of
this
pre-sentence
investigation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
dissenting
opinion
has
suggested
--
he
didn’t
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
could
it
be
possibly
reveal
the
sentence
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wasn’t
it
implicit
in
the
florida
law
that
at
least
thought
understood
in
upholding
that
all
of
this
would
be
open
and
above
board
both
from
the
trial
court
and
in
the
appellate
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
wasn’t
that
the
occasions
for
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
livingston,
a
little
while
ago,
you
said
that
the
jury
must
have
found
some
mitigating
circumstances,
can
you
enlighten
me
as
to
what
those
possibly
were?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
extreme,
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
argue
this
to
the
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
those
arguments
of
course
were
available
to
the
court.
