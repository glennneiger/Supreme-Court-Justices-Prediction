justice
potter
stewart
did
you
indicate
earlier,
general
allbritton
that
you
didn’t
understand
that
the
sentencing
judge
relied
on
the
presentence
report.
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
be
very
expressed,
i’m
looking
at
page
a
138
of
the
appendix,
you’re
familiar
with
that
i
gather.
justice
potter
stewart
which
he
says
two
different
times
--
he
says,
first
of
all
he
received
the
presentence
investigative
report,
on
the
said
defendant
by
--
and
received
by
the
state
defendant’s
attorney
of
a
copy
of
that
portion
there
after
which
they
are
entitled
and
then
he
says
and
after
carefully
considering
and
waiting,
waiving
and
reviewing
the
factual
information
contained
in
the
said
pre-sentence
investigation,
the
undersigned
concludes
and
determines
that
aggravating
circumstances
exist
to
whip
itemized
as
under
any
sentences
the
defendant
to
death.
that’s
pretty
clear
that
he
did
rely
on
it,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
both
of
which
were
cited
and
presently
approved
in
the
one
of
the
opinions
in
proffitt
and
each
of
which
approved
the
use
of
a
presentence
investigation
report
by
the
sentencing
judge
under
the
florida
system,
didn’t
they?
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
clear
in
each
of
those
cases
that
there
had
been
a
disclosure
to
the
defendant
or
his
counsel
of
the
contents
of
the
pre-sentence
investigation.
justice
potter
stewart
both
of
those
decisions
were
implicitly
approved,
weren’t
they
in
the
footnote
number
9,
in
one
of
the
opinions
in
proffitt.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
signer
expressly
states
that
he
receive
a
copy
of
the
psi
and
it
doesn’t
differentiate
between
the
non
confidential
and
the
confidential
part,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
you
are
mistaken.
justice
potter
stewart
in
saying
that
they
--
there
was
not
a
disclosure
of
the
confidential
portion
of
it
in
songer.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
in
songer
or
swan,
in
one
of
the
cases
at
least
the
florida
supreme
court
set
aside
the
death
sentence.
justice
potter
stewart
