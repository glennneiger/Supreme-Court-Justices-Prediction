e.

we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
74-6593,
gardner
against
florida.
mr.
livingston,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
the
basis
of
a
trial
judge’s
determination,
was
it
not
the
nature
of
the
crime
which
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
would
the
district
judge
find
out
the
facts
to
become
fully
aware
of
the
facts
that
would
motivate
his
decision
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
where
do
you
normally
find
out
what
are
the
facts
of
the
case,
in
the
courtroom,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’ve
lost
me
there.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
addressing
your
comment
to
the
pre-sentence
report,
are
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
the
officer
making
that
pre-sentence
report
not
to
be
familiar
with
the
evidence
in
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
are
addressing
yourself
to
his
lack
of
capacity
to
make
some
of
these
observations
but
by
this
time,
the
case
has
been
tried
and
the
jury
has
returned
its
verdict
and
its
public
knowledge
as
to
what
went
on.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
there
is
anything
in
this
report
which
was
not
disclosed
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing
hearing
which
would
have
tended
exculpate
and
to
persuade
someone
that
the
death
sentence
should
not
be
imposed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn’t
it
be
harmless
if
there
was
exculpatory
evidence
here
which
you
might
have
exploited.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it’s
your
view
that
the
--
that
there
is
no
way
of
determining
what
the
judge
had
in
his
mind
when
he
imposed
the
death
sentence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you’re
assuming
this
conclusion
all
of
it
in
advance,
when
you
say
re-institute
the
sentence.
if
it's
remanded
so
that
this
ultimately
reaches
the
sentencing
judge
with
directions
to
open
up
the
record
and
hear
any
arguments
you
have,
are
you
assuming
in
advance
that
he
will
impose
the
same
sentence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
new
sentencing
procedure
before
the
sentencing
jury.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
which
this
total
information
would
go
to
that
jury.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
matter
is
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
proposed
by
this
report?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
you
not
have
demonstrated
to
the
sentencing
jury
all
the
information
which
is
in
this
report,
about
his
lifelong
drinking
habits,
his
tendency
to
violence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
cuts
syndicate
–
it
cuts
not
both
ways
if
you
want
to
go
back
to
that
sentencing
jury,
it
cuts
only
one
way.
the
best
you
can
get
of
them
is
reaffirmation
of
the
life
sentence,
life
recommendation
and
if
they
have
all
this
information
before
them,
they
might
impose
the
death
sentence,
might
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
a
possibility.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
came
to
the
point
that
the
jury
had
returned
this
recommendation
and
you
were
before
the
judge,
before
the
final
stage,
was
there
any
evidence
tendered
on
behalf
of
the
sentence
to
convicted
man
or
profited
in
any
way
to
enlarge
the
showing
to
the
judge
as
to
why
he
should
accept
the
jury’s
recommendation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
said
you
want
to
know
that
in
order
to
persuade
the
judge
that
it
isn’t
true,
that’d
be
one
approach,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
you
say
that
it
is
true
and
that
this
shows
this
is
a
lifelong
pattern
of
conduct
which
is
in
your
view
a
reason
why
the
death
sentence
should
not
be,
i
suppose
you
could
play
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
utmost
your
remedy
would
be
a
remand
to
the
district
judge
to
do
what
you
now
say
he
should've
done
at
the
time
or
his
--
your
client’s
then
counsel
should
have
done
had
he
known
these
things
and
go
through
the
process
again,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
allbritton.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
say
it
was
not
raised
--
it
was
not
raised
by
the
parties
but
it
was
raised
by
the
dissenting
justices,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn’t
that
possible
that
since
this
is
an
evolving
area
of
the
law,
both
at
the
level
of
this
court
and
in
the
states,
by
virtue
of
these
recent
holdings
that
the
tedder
opinion
cited
after
the
court
passed
on
this
case,
the
florida
court
indicates
some
enlarging
of
their
view
of
the
matter
of
what
they
should
consider.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
case
were
to
go
back,
in
your
view,
should
it
go
back
to
the
supreme
court
and
i
emphasize
the
“if”
to
go
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
for
their
reconsideration
taking
into
account
the
material
now
in
the
record
or
do
you
think
it
should
go
back
to
the
sentencing
judge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
rule
however,
federal
level
has
not
been
considered
or
litigated
in
connection
with
the
imposition
of
a
death
sentence
under
the
new
federal
statutes
however.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
have
a
lot
of
time
yet.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
please,
you
have
30
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
think
of
any
reason
counsel
why,
if
a
motion
had
been
made
before
the
sentencing
judge
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
to
produce
the
entire
pre-sentence
report.
that
it
should
not
have
been
made
available
to
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
why
he
did
not
do
that
on
his
own
motion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
resume
there
at
1
o’clock
counsel.
mr.
allbritton,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
suppose
that’s
what
the
court
said
through
mr.
black
in
williams
against
new
york.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
you
were
quoting
from
williams
against
new
york.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
up
mr.
allbritton.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
livingston?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
a
minute
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
one
minute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
said
in
your
opening
argument
that
--
were
these
case
back
before
the
jury
you
would
object
to
the
submission
of
the
pre-sentence
report
to
the
jury.
did
i
understand
you
correctly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
that
point,
the
guilt
has
been
determined
by
the
jury,
why
would
that
be
excludable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
were
talking
in
your
opening
argument
about
the
possibility
of
the
case
being
before
the
sentencing
jury
after
the
determination
of
guilt
and
i
understood
you
to
say
that
if
the
case
by
some
chance
should
get
into
that
posture
by
virtue
of
any
remand,
you
would
object
to
the
introduction
of
the
report,
at
that
stage,
in
the
sentencing
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
it
went
to
the
sentencing
jury,
you
surely
would
have
a
copy
of
it.
it
can't
go
to
the
jury
without
through
you,
through
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
of
the
court
in
no.
