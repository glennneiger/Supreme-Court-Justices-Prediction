mr.
charles
h.
livingston
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
certiorari
from
the
affirmance
of
daniel
wilbur
gardner.
petitioner
was
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
in
florida
of
his
wife
following
a
hard
day,
a
night
of
drinking
and
arguments
about
the
location
of
their
children.
as
the
sentence
that
was
conducted
pursuant
to
florida’s
bifurcated
sentencing
procedure,
the
state
introduce
into
evidence
two
photographs
of
the
victim
waived
argument.
the
petitioner
testified
on
his
own
behalf
and
his
counsel
made
argument,
the
jury
returned
the
sentencing
verdict
of
life
which
in
florida
is
an
advisory
verdict.
the
trial
judge
then
ordered
and
considered
a
pre-sentence
investigation
disclosing
portions
of
that
pre-sentence
investigation
to
both
the
state
and
to
petitioner’s
counsel.
he
rejected
the
jury
sentencing
verdict
of
life
and
sentenced
petitioner
to
death
on
the
basis
and
his
fact
finding
that
the
aggravating
circumstance
of
the
nature
to
crime
being
especially
heinous,
atrocious
and
cruel.
state
supreme
court
affirmed
per
curiam
to
the
seven
justices
of
that
court
entered
a
sentence
saying
that
it
was
fundamental
error
for
the
trial
judge
to
have
considered
and
failed
to
disclose
portions
of
pre-sentence
investigation.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
one
problem
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
your
honor,
that’s
really
the
crucial
problem
of
the
case.
the
petitioner
is
not
in
any
position
to
know
really.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
as
to
the
facts
of
the
incident
as
opposed
to
the
individualized
considerations
of
the
defendant,
it
would
be
from
the
trial.
he
said
they
are
just
false
the
jury
did
obviously.
what
we
do
not
know
is
what
sort
of
force
the
information
contained
in
the
confidential
portion
of
pre-sentence
investigation
had
his
determination
of
sentence.
what
sort
of
force
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
your
honor,
the
state
has
recently
about
three
weeks
ago
as
an
appendix
to
its
brief
reproduced
what
purports
to
be
a
fact
simile,
the
confidential
portion
of
the
pre-sentence
investigation
which
is
something
that
we
have
not
seen
until
now.
no
one
has
seen
until
now,
we
do
not
need
this
authenticity.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
thank
you
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
it’s
appendix
a
to
the
appellee’s
brief
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
and
this
is
after
this
court
grant
certiorari.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
yes
sir,
with
your
permission
i’m
going
in
to
that
right
now.
first,
we
claim
that
this
can’t
be
decided
on
the
basis
that
anywhere
because
its
not
in
the
record.
it’s
never
been
authenticated,
we
don’t
admit
its
authenticity.
secondly,
introducing
at
this
late
date,
almost
three
years
after
the
time
it
was
used,
flaws
of
procedural
irregularity
required
under
the
capital
sentencing
procedures,
post
july
till
1976.
third,
there
is
no
fair
and
proper
way
that
petitioner
either
now
or
particularly
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing,
it
was
not
disclosed
can
deal
with
this
that
the
reasons
we
say
mandate
disclosure
of
information
using
considered
by
the
trial
judge.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
yes,
there
are
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
obviously,
mr.
justice
brennan,
this
is
then
arguendo
because
we’re
not
assuming
is
proper
before
the
court,
we’re
not
admitting
but
there
are
at
least
three
factors
that
are
significant
here
and
a
false
law
jury
one,
in
the
information
that
was
disclosed,
petitioner
and
his
counsel,
there
was
information,
he
had
a
series
of
assault
charges,
all
of
which
were
dismissed,
were
now
frost.
there
was
a
statement
from
police
officers,
he
had
a
long
line
of
charges
involving
his
wives.
that
was
disclosed.
we’re
getting
to
the
confidential
portion.
for
the
first
time,
the
probation
officer
does
something
that
the
police,
the
prosecutors,
and
no
jury
has
ever
done.
he
convicts
petitioner.
he
says
that
the
petitioner
has
beaten
his
wife
“x”
times.
that
is
not
established
in
the
view
of
the
petitioner.
we
think
it
would
be
significant
in
the
trial
judge’s
mind.
secondly,
he
ends
up
with
a
note.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
your
honor,
it
would
not
be
the
evidence
in
the
case
so
much
as
background
of
the
individual.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
and
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
i’m
sorry
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
if
i
let
you
strained,
but
we’re
not
contesting
the
actual
incident
for
which
petitioner
was
convicted
but
rather
probation
officer
was
referring
to
other
instance
going
back
to
1960
or
something
which
we
do
not
admit
occurred.
and
it
is
never
been
tested
in
the
adversarial
process.
these
were
all
the
charges
that
were
denied
or
dismissed
or
now
frost.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
no
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
i
didn’t
represent
petitioner
at
trial.
i
think
he
was
entitled
to
be
--
had
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
pardon?
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
i
think
he
was
entitled
to
notice
that
something
that
was
going
to
go
before
the
judge
and
then
to
have
with
the
consultation
of
his
counsel.
make
that
decision.
we’re
really
referring
in
particularity
not
so
much
for
ours
incident
but
to
the
statement
on
page
61,
the
same
appendix.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
first
paragraph.
it
should
be
noted
the
subject
in
this
charges
has
had
at
least
three
times
when
he
has
beaten
his
wife.
and
that
is
the
first
time
that
this
comes
up
in
any
way
other
than
these
arrests
which
were
all
tossed
out.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
correct,
that
is
the
victim.
correct
that
is
the
second
one.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
yes
sir.
but
this
never
arose
before.
this
is
the
first
time
we’ve
seen
this
on
a
confidential
portion
of
psi.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
no
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
no
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
no
sir.
if
i’d
represented
petitioner
at
trial,
in
front
of
the
jury,
he
would
certainly
try
to
exclude
that
evidence,
we
sadly
remiss,
if
he
denied.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
i
believe
it
would've
been
admissible
under
florida
statute
921.41.
i
can’t
at
this
moment
fall
out
of
my
head
the
exact
aggravating
circumstance
it
would
fit
under.
i
think
you
would
have
a
difficult
time
keeping
it
out.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
the
florida
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
the
florida
statute
does
provide
that
the
state
can
use
hearsay
testimony
in
sentencing
proceeding.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
well,
what
they
would've
had
to
done
is
precisely
what
was
not
done
here
mr.
justice
brennan.
even
if
they
do
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
okay.
if
they
had
used
this
information
or
attempted
to
use
it
regardless
of
the
form
whether
it
was
police
reports,
hearsay
police
officers,
whatever,
they
would've
--
then
the
petitioner
would
notice
what
they
were
trying
to
do.
they
would've
given
him
the
opportunity
“x”
necessity
to
correct
it,
explain
it,
rebut
it,
if
necessary
instead
of,
you
know,
being
a
shot
from
the
dark,
something
that
only
the
judge
saw.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
well,
your
honor,
i
think,
if
i
may
turn
that
just
a
little
bit
and
that
goes
to
what
appears
to
be
the
state's
position,
it's
all
harmless
error
anyway
regardless.
and
i
don’t
think
that
we
can
point
so
much
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
no
sir.
but
i
think
what
we’re
forced
into
doing
but
the
posture
of
the
case
is
speculative
of
what
was
going
in
the
trial
judges’
mind.
our
position
is
that
you’re
entitled
to
have
the
information,
entitled
to
make
your
case
before
he
makes
up
his
mind.
but
to
directly
to
your
point,
i
think
it
would
pertinent
as
to
how
he
might
have
discounted
mitigating
evidence.
the
jury
had
everything
the
judge
had
except
this
two
psi
reports.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
i
think
that
we
are
forced
to
speculate
and
that
takes
out
a
harmless
error
rule
under
chapman.
but
if
i
may
return
to
what
i
was
saying,
that
the
jury
after
all
voted
for
life.
they
had
everything
that
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
yes
sir.
i
don’t
think
the
case
would
be
strong
however.
i
think
the
principle
would
still
pertain,
i
think
this
is
a
strength
of
the
case
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
yes
sir.
i
think,
it’s
significant
but
not
controlling.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
he
rejected
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
was
first
raised
before
the
state
supreme
court.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
no
sir.
in
capital
cases
in
florida,
appeals
taken
directly
under
the
florida
constitution
from
the
trial
court
or
the
circuit
court
in
florida
(voice
overlap)
state
supreme
court.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
it
was
mentioned
but
not
with
the
exactness.
it
should
have
been,
it
was
mentioned
again
in
the
reply
brief,
it
was
mentioned
oral
argument,
the
two
dissenting
justices
both
picked
up
on
it.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
per
curiam
opinion
in
the
state
of
florida
does
not
deal
with
any
issue
advanced
by
appellant
in
that
court.
it
states
the
jurisdiction.
it
states
what
the
indictment
says.
it
repeats
the
fact
finding
of
the
judge
and
says
affirmed.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
their
practice
is
in
capital
cases
to
consider
errors
even
if
not
contemporaneously
objected
to
at
the
trial
level.
appellate
rules
6.16
and
3.7,
both
permit
there
under
recognized
plenary.
6.16
goes
further
and
says
in
capital
cases,
they’re
under
duty
to
review
the
record.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
yes
sir.
and
--
would
say
that,
as
to
your
point,
it's
certainly,
they
are
not
raised
with
the
precision
one
would
like
in
retrospect
and
certainly
raised
better
than
the
issue
was
(inaudible).
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
your
honor,
the
court's
statement
at
the
time
of
sentencing
was
--
i
have
furnished
to
counsel
or
has
counsel
for
the
state
received
the
portion
of
the
psi
report
to
which
they
are
entitled.
sounding
like
the
decision
already
made
as
to
what
he
was
going
to
give
them.
the
prosecutor
said,
the
state
has
your
honor,
defense
counsel
at
the
defense
session
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
so
presumably,
they
could
figure
out
that
if
they
were
only
receiving
portion
of
it
that
it
--
there
was
a
portion
that
wasn’t
been
given
to
him.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
we
did
not
know
for
sure
and
--
excuse
me,
we
still
do
not
know
for
sure,
mr.
justice
white,
if
there
is
in
fact
a
written
confidential
portion,
the
pre-sentence
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
we
are
claiming
that
he
stayed
in
this
findings
of
fact,
he
considered
it.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
state
supreme
court.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
yes,
defense
counsel
could
have
it,
it
was
not
done.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
well,
if
we
prevail,
it
seems
to
us,
there
are
at
least
three
possible
things
that
could
happen
on
remand,
one
would
be
simply
to
send
it
back
to
the
state’s
supreme
court
and
say
consider
it
now.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
yes
sir.
but
to
me,
that
would
be
inadequate
because
the
state’s
supreme
court,
like
this
court,
has
no
way
of
certifying,
authenticating,
that
is
in
fact
what
the
judge
used
and
considered.
secondly,
the
state
supreme
court
will
now
have
the
benefit
of
petitioner’s
trial
counsel's
reaction
to
this
information.
his
attempt
to
rebut
it
or
explain
it
or
argue
it
away,
whatever.
the
second
alternative
would
be
to
send
it
to
the
trial
court
simply
for
some
sort
of
proforma
ignition
of
the
record,
of
the
matter
into
the
record
and
then
to
reinstitute
a
sentence.
we
submit
that
would
be
inadequate
simply
because
it
would
be
proforma--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
re-institute.
the
third
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
your
honor,
i
hesitate
to
do
so,
i
know,
this
court
hesitates
to
do
so,
but
i
think,
given
the
gravity
of
the
decision
he
has
already
made
is
beyond
any
human
being
to
say,
oops!
i
made
a
mistake
in
sentencing
someone
to
death.
let
me
try
to
do
it
again.
and
that’s
why
i
think
the
third
alternative,
the
third
choice
on
remand
is
the
proper
choice.
that
would
be
to
remand
the
case
for
a
new
sentencing
proceeding
de
novo,
obviously
it
didn't
touch
the
conviction
at
all.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
correct
your
honor
and
that
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
if
the
judge
intends
to
use
and
consider
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
no
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
because
we
think
that
--
the
florida
procedure
seems
to
be
something
of
a
hybrid.
most
states
either
have
or
the
judge
firmly
determines
capital
sentence
or
the
jury
firmly
determines
it.
in
florida
they
have
the
advisory
sentence
of
the
jury
is
important,
it
is
supposed
to
have
an
effect
upon
the
judge.
now,
if
we
were
on
remand,
if
the
state
were
willing
to
stipulate
at
the
jury
would
again
recommend
life,
i
think
that
would
be
a
decision
to
be
made
at
that
point
by
petitioner
and
his
counsel
at
that
point.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
in
the
case
in
its
present
posture.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
i
don't.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
oh!
no
sir,
i
think
on
remand
the
proper
solution
will
be
to
have
another
judge
and
have
him
to
--
he
would
need
to
do
from
the
beginning.
now
if
that
could
be
done
fairly
by
studying
the
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
yes,
i
see
that
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
i
think
my
difficulty
is
that
on
remand
we
would
submit,
petitioner
submits
that
the
proper
solution
would
be
to
give
to
a
different
and
he
would
have
to
have
the
benefit
of
that
information
and
perhaps
it
could
be
done
by
stipulation
by
a
case
stated
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
not
to
my
knowledge
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
yet
we
would
point
out,
this
is
a
capital
case
under
the
post
furman,
post
woodson,
post
proffitt
procedures
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
well,
because
this
point
is
extremely
a
significant
decision
has
to
be
made
with
the
utmost
regard
for
procedural
regularity.
if
i
may
return
to
one
thing
you
raised
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
and
that
is
you
asked
how
do
you
think
this
might
have
been
used
by
the
trial
judge
and
that
would
be
that
we
know
the
jury
recommend
life.
the
most
likely
mitigating
factor
in
the
jury’s
mind
was
the
drinking,
the
children,
the
marital
setting
in
the
situation.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
what
we
don’t
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
no,
sir,
but
what
we
are
getting
to
is
that
what
--
how
this
report
might
have
actually
used
and
again
would
force
a
speculation.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
well,
the
problem
with
the
drinking
and
violence
is
that
these
things
could
cut
those
ways.
it's
something
the
trial
counsel
should
be
aware
of
at
the
time
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
when
i
was
talking
the
use
of
the
information
in
the
confidential
portion
of
psi,
i
was
attempting
to
address
the
issue
of
how
the
judge
might
have
used
it
since
we’re
forcing
to
speculating.
and
it
seems
that
the
use
of
it
and
the
danger
in
it
is
that,
they
say,
well,
he
has
beaten
his
wife.
he
had
a
worse
military
record
than
it
was
apparently
disclosed.
he
is
characterized
by
the
probation
officers,
the
usual
drinker
and
the
fighter,
assaultive
nature,
etcetera,
etcetera.
and
how
that
might
have
been
used
by
the
judge
is
to
knockout
what
the
trial
jury
apparently
found
in
the
mitigating
circumstances.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
correct.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
correct.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
correct.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
right.
in
this
case,
what
occurred
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
the
jury
returns
its
verdict
on
january
10,
i
believe,
he
had
that
time
ordered
a
pre-sentence
investigation,
was
turned
into
him
on
january
28,
he
sentenced
the
petitioner
on
january
30th.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
no
sir.
he
came
in,
stated
i
have
furnished
this
to
counsel
and
the
portion
to
which
they
are
entitled,
is
there
anything
to
say,
no
sir,
does
the
defendant
have
anything
to
say,
defense
counsel
at
that
point,
pointed
out
the
jury
advisory
verdict
and
(voice
overlap)
he
had
already
made
his
determination
before
he
asked
them
to
say
anything.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
well,
the
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
well,
i
think
we’ve
enforced
speculating
in
the
difficulty
ruling
mr.
justice
brennan
is,
that
he
was
no
given
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
the
florida
procedure
allows
locution
immediately
prior
to
the
imposition
of
sentence.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
but
there’s
no
clear
step
in
the
statute
that
says,
you
have
a
separate
opportunity
for
argument
at
the
time
of
the
judge’s
decision.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
subsequent
to
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
subsequent
to
the
return
of
the
jury’s
advisory
verdict,
correct
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
he
does
have
a
jury
recommendation
in
a
line
of
cases
decided
subsequent
to
the
sentencing.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
he
has
a
written
record
and
in
a
line
of
cases
decided
by
the
state
supreme
court
subsequent
to
the
petitioner’s
case.
they
have
imposed
extremely
heavy
importance
to
a
jury
advisory
verdict
of
life.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
yes
sir,
it
was.
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
no
sir.
the
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
it
did
not
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
correct.
and
as
to
tedder
and
hollowell
and
some
of
the
other
cases
to
which
you’re
referring
and
to
which
you
all
referred
in
the
judgment
of
the
court,
mr.
justice
stewart,
stevens,
and
powell,
tedder
was
after
this
case
and
it's
just
as
a
simple
statistical
matter,
there
are
now
77
people
on
death
row
in
florida.
twenty-seven
of
them
had
jury
verdicts
recommending
life
which
were
overridden.
and
a
vast
disproportionate
numbers
were
early
capital
cases
in
florida.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
yes
sir.
i
think
that
is
colored
in
the
opinion
announcing
the
judgment
of
the
court.
in
proffitt,
i
think
it
also
can
be
inferred
from
the
decision
in
woods
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
no,
mr.
chief
justice
furthermore
there
was
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
if
petitioner
and
his
counsel
had
known
what
was
in
the
confidential
protion
of
psi,
it
very
well
might
have
been.
but
in
a
disclosed
portion
of
psi,
they
could
easily
have
concluded
there
was
nothing
worth
rebutting.
they
could
have
relied
on
the
jury
verdict,
they
could
have
relied
on
what
was
gone
before.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
yes
sir,
they
were
instructed
pursuant
to
florida
statute
921.41
to
the
mitigating
circumstances
provided
by
that
statute.
the
defendant
acted
under
the
influence
of
extreme
mental
or
emotional
disturbance.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
mental
or
emotional
disturbance
or
to
his
capacity
to
recognize
criminality,
conform
his
conduct
to
it
was
substantially
impaired.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
i
believe
it
was
argued
in
effect
based
on
the
drinking.
i
was
not
trial
counsel
but
the
drinking,
the
petitioner
saying
i
was
not
in
my
right
mind
and
so
forth
was
presumably
together
with
the
distress
about
the
location
of
the
children.
presumably
what
the
jury
hung
the
huddle
in
the
advisory
verdict.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
certainly.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
yes
sir.
there
is
also
a
claim,
the
petitioner
spent
time
in
the
brig
when
he
was
in
the
military
which
is
not
in
the
disclosed
proportion.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
there
is
also
a
claim
in
the
confidential
portion.
that
he
spent
time
in
the
brig
while
in
the
air
force
an
yet
that
is
not
in
the
disclosed
portion
in
the
pre-sentence
investigation.
there
is
a
serious
of
characterizations
about
he
has
an
assaultive
nature,
he’s
the
usual
drinker
and
fighter,
etcetera,
etcetera.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
yes
sir.
although
i
think
that
perhaps
that
was
included
in
the
conclusion
back
on
page
61.
but
there
was
a
series
of
things
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
yes
sir.
not
only
would
i
like
to
know,
i
think
petitioner
has
a
sound
constitutional
right
on
both
the
due
process
and
sixth
amendment
provisions
of
the
federal
constitution
to
know,
he
did
know,
his
counsel
did
not
know
and
the
sentencing
is
defective
for
that
reason.
if
i
may
reserve
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
that
would
be
one
approach
mr.
chief
justice
or
to
fashion
an
argument
as
in
herring
v.
new
york,
you
needed
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
correct
mr.
chief
justice
and
we
claim
that
we
need
to
know
before
the
decision
is
made.
it
doesn’t
do
us
any
good
at
this
point.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
we
think
the
constitution
under
pending
of
our
argument
be
required
to
at
least
go
back
to
the
point
of
the
jury’s
verdict
and
then
forward.
and
the
jury
sentencing
verdict
even
though,
i
misspoke
myself
somewhere
early.
thank
you.
and
may
i
reserve
the
minutes
that
i
have,
left.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
yes
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
thank
you.
how
many
sir?
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
as
to
williams,
mr.
justice
stevens
is
exactly
correct,
that
was
the
confrontation
case.
it
was
not
a
disclosure
case.
337
u.s.
244
describes
how
that
information
was
disclosed
in
open
court.
in
addition
williams
was
a
pre
furman
case
also
decided
obviously
before
the
july
1976
capital
cases.
as
to
the
confidential
problem,
that
can
be
controlled.
federal
rule
32
controls,
we
are
not
here
claiming
that
a
constitutional
right
to
be
free
from
all
out
of
court
information.
but
we
are
here
saying
that
we
are
entitled
to
know
what
the
judge
is
using.
if
there’s
a
need
to
protect
somebody.
if
there
is
a
need
not
to
disclose,
he
can
disclose
that.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
he
could've
affected
it
by
knocking
out
the
mitigating
circumstances
in
which
the
jury
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
that
circumstance
was
in
open
court
before
both
judge
and
jury.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
or
to
the
disregarding
and
mitigating
circumstance
which
necessarily
must
have
been
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
correct.
and
he
found
it
by
reading
it,
the
same
information
differently
than
the
jury
did
about
the
drinking
and
whatever
and
the
only
difference
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
that
would
not
be
found
upon
the
confidential
report
--
the
undisclosed,
unjustified,
unexplained
nondisclosure,
the
confidential
portion,
no
sir,
it
would
not
be.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
sir,
i
believe
that
we’re
being
pushed
into
speculating
as
to
what
effect
did
his
decision
making
process
at
this
crucial
stage
and
then
by
being
forced
to
speculate
takes
out
harmless
error
in
any
event.
that
yes,
we
are
having
to
guess
and
i
think
that’s
the
most
likely
operation
there.
they
caused
him
to
disregard
what
the
jury
found
to
be
mitigating.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
stewart,
neither
of
which
addressed
the
confidential
problem
however.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
in
songer,
i
am
certain
there
was
a
disclosure
of
the
non
confidential
portion
but
not
the
confidential
portion.
to
swan,
i
don’t
have
any
present
recollection
as
to
that
point?
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
correct.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
on
what
point
sir?
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
no
sir.
the
songer
--
it's
outside
the
record.
in
songer,
there
was
a
confidential
portion,
there
was
a
disclosed
portion.
the
defendant
did
not
get
the
confidential
portion.
the
florida
supreme
court
decision
addresses
the
area
of
the
psi
in
general
but
does
not
address
itself
to
confidential
versus
disclosed.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
had
the
swan
--
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
songer
is
still
under
the
sentence
of
death.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
my
understanding
at
the
time
of
--
that
point
in
the
argument
mr.
chief
justice
was
the
information
as
to
the
guilt
deciding
phase
of
the
trial
as
being
collateral
incidence
relevant
to
a
crime.
if
i
were
his
trial
counsel
i
think
and
the
trial
counsel
would
object
to
this
collateral
information
coming
on
the
guilty,
not
guilty
phase,
about
the
guilty
trial.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
no
sir,
what
i
was
about
was
--
if
there
is
an
effort
to
it,
introduce
it
at
the
guilt
determination.
the
first
half
of
the
trial.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
well,
my
answer
may
not
be
responsive,
my
understanding
at
the
time
of
making
that
answer
was
related
to
the
first
half
of
the
trial,
it
didn’t
involve
here.
but
as
to
the
sentencing
jury,
our
position
is
that
if
the
state
is
going
to
use,
if
the
judge
is
going
to
use
it
to
consider
it,
review
it.
that
the
defendant
should
at
least
be
entitled
to
notice
of
the
general
nature
of
it,
so
if
they
can't
--
they
may
not
be
able
to
keep
it
up.
they
can
rebut
it,
clarify
it
or
explain
it.
mr.
charles
h.
livingston
well,
one
would
think
the
due
process
clause
and
the
sixth
amendment
would
keep
it
from
going
to
the
judge
without
going
through
us
either
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
thank
you
very
much.
