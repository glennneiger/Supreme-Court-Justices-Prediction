justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
correct
that
in
the
williams
case,
the
out
of
court
information
which
the
judge
received
was
disclosed
to
the
defendant
and
its
counsel
in
open
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
issue
in
that
case
as
i
read
it
was
the
question
of
confrontation
of
the
out
of
court
sources
of
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
gardner
against
florida,
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
first-degree
murder
in
the
circuit
court
of
citrus
county
florida
and
sentenced
to
death.
when
the
trial
judge
imposed
the
death
sentence,
he
stated
that
he
was
relying
in
part
on
information
in
a
presentence
investigation
report.
portions
of
the
report
were
not
disclosed
to
counsel
for
the
parties.
without
reviewing
the
confidential
portion
of
the
presentence
report,
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
over
the
dissent
of
two
justices,
affirmed
the
death
sentence.
in
an
opinion
which
i
have
delivered
to
the
clerk,
which
is
joined
by
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
powell,
we
conclude
that
this
procedure
does
not
satisfy
the
constitutional
command
that
no
person
shall
be
deprived
of
life
without
due
process
of
law.
the
chief
justice
while
not
joining
our
opinion,
concurs
in
the
judgment,
vacating
the
death
sentence
and
remanding
the
case
to
the
florida
supreme
court
with
directions
to
order
further
proceedings
at
the
trial
court
level.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
agreeing
with
the
reasoning
in
our
opinion,
but
stating
that
he
would
simply
vacate
the
death
sentence.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
also
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
