unknown
speaker
you
have
no
idea
what
was
not
disclosed?
unknown
speaker
mr.
livingston,
i
wonder
if
you
would
lift
that
microphone
up
a
little
bit
or
--
it’s
hard
for
me
to
hear
you
over
here.
thank
you!
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
for
example,
i’m
looking
at
page
57,
i’d
like
to
get
clear
what
you’re
suggesting
to?
here,
there
is
a
reference
to
an
incident
involving
a
first
wife
at
fort
myers,
was
there
any
evidence
that
the
trial
for
this
offense
involving
an
incident
at
fort
myers
involving
the
first
wife?
unknown
speaker
and
what
you’re
saying
here
is
that
here
at
length,
this
confidential
report
discusses
an
incident
at
fort
myers
and
lines
up
with
the
--
he
broke
into
a
trailer
and
noticed
the
colored
man
sitting
in
the
front
parlor
with
no
clothes
on
and
his
wife
in
the
backroom
with
a
white
band
apparently
fighting
or
arguing.
he
stated
he
took
out
his
knife
and
told
the
colored
man
to
get
there
and
so
forth.
now,
that’s
an
incident
at
fort
myers.
had
you
have
this
information?
would
you
have
offered
anything
to
contradict
what
stated
here?
unknown
speaker
i’m
speaking
of
the
sentencing
hearing.
unknown
speaker
at
the
sentencing
hearing.(voice
overlap).
he
would
have
this
at
that
time,
would
there
have
been
an
effort
to
refute
this
other
evidence?
unknown
speaker
which
is
that
now?
unknown
speaker
now,
this
is
on
the
victim,
the
(voice
overlap),
that’s
the
first
wife.
unknown
speaker
and
in
other
words
that
he
had
a
record
of
at
least
three
times
beating
on
the
same
woman
for
whose
killing
he
was
convicted,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
not
in
evidence
at
the
trail.
unknown
speaker
or
before
the
jury
that
was
determining
sentencing.
unknown
speaker
of
course
that
was,
--
it
would
have
been
an
evidence,
it
would
hardly
have
been
helpful
to
your
employer.
unknown
speaker
but
would
that
have
been
admissible
under
the
new
florida
capital
punishment
law
at
the
sentencing
proceedings
before
the
jury,
after
the
conviction?
unknown
speaker
but
we
simply
can't
(inaudible)
--
would
the
state
had
to
produce
witnesses
at
the
sentencing
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
isn’t
that
right?
unknown
speaker
now,
the
jury
had
voted
for
death.
without
having
any
of
this
and
then
the
trial
judge
did
what
he
did
without
disclosing
this,
would
you
be
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
i’m
putting
out
the
other
way,
i
gather
you
think
it's
significant,
the
jury
voted
only
for
life
and
it’s
the
judge
who
voted
death
after
having
seen
this
and
not
disposing
it.
unknown
speaker
petitioner
said
voted,
he
imposed
with
that
sentence.
unknown
speaker
when
did
you
first
know
that
the
court
had
relied
on
this?
unknown
speaker
it’s
out
of
the
case
now?
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
you
prevail,
what
happens
to
this
case?
unknown
speaker
for
a
re-sentence.
unknown
speaker
when
they
will
say
re-institute
or
redetermine?
unknown
speaker
so
at
least
there
is
no
adversary
hearing
before
the
judge
mandated
by
the
florida
statute.
unknown
speaker
so
that
insofar
as
the
judge’s
function
is
concerned,
it's
just
as
in
likely
the
more
traditional
states
where
judge
does
the
sentencing
except
that
he
does
have
a
jury
recommendation.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
has
the
record.
he
has
a
written
record.
unknown
speaker
mr.
livingston,
before
you
conclude,
i
would
like
you
to
complete
your
answer
to
a
question
that
what
asked
very
early
in
the
argument.
you
were
asked
to
identify
the
portions
of
the
confidential
pre-sentence
report
which
were
adverse
to
your
client
and
which
included
matter
not
in
the
record
before
the
jury,
you
did
identify
on
page
61
the
reference
to
actual
beatings
as
opposed
to
arrests.
is
there
anything
else?
unknown
speaker
and
what
was
that
again
counsel?
unknown
speaker
isn’t
it
correct
that
as
a
matter
of
florida
law
only
a
portion
of
the
pre-sentence
report
is
disclosable
or
do
i
misunderstand,
i’m
not
--
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
now,
doesn’t
the
florida
practice
require
the
supreme
court
to
search
the
record
for
all
possible
material
error.
unknown
speaker
and
is
the
procedure
they
followed
in
this
case
consistent
with
their
later
description
of
the
procedure
in
the
tedder
case.
unknown
speaker
can
it
be
consistent
if
they
did
not
look
at
the
same
material
that
the
trial
judge
relied
on,
on
their
own
initiative?(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
you
just
said
that
they
have
a
duty
independently
to
investigate
every
potential
issue
that’s
material.
i
thought
you
said
that
was
the
practice
in
the
supreme
court.
unknown
speaker
and
why
is
the
absence
of
a
requests
of
any
materiality
though.
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
knew
as
they
did,
that
the
trial
judge
relied
on
something
not
before
them,
didn’t
the
tedder
opinion
indicate
that
they
would've
independently
made
an
effort
to
find
out
what
was
the
basis
for
his
decision
of
death
row
than
life.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
what
tedder
in
substance
says.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they
read
the
dissenting
opinion,
they
knew
that
the
trial
relied
on
something
that
they
did
not
have
before
them.
unknown
speaker
but
does
that
matter
under
tedder?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
shouldn’t
the
supreme
court
of
florida
look
at
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don’t
suggest
that
the
point
wasn’t
made
in
the
florida
supreme
court
that
the
trial
judge
had
relied
on
material
that
had
not
been
disclosed.
and
it
was
clear
that
the
appellant
there
was
urging
that
that
was
error,
constitutional
error.
unknown
speaker
is
this
wrong,
i’m
reading
from
page
26
from
the
petitioner’s
brief.
it
says,
his
assignment,
of
error
number
13
contended
that
the
court
erred
in
considering
your
pre-sentence
investigation
of
defendant
in
his
assignment
and
the
error
number
12
contended
that
the
trial
court
erred
in
rendering
its
findings
of
fact
and
supported
that
penalty
because
the
court
considered
factors
not
based
upon
the
record
of
the
trial
in
sentencing
proceedings.
unknown
speaker
well,
his
brief
goes
on
and
then
gives
much
more
details
about
it.
isn't
it
--
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
mr.
allbritton.
doesn’t
this
get
us
back
to
my
brother
stevens
question
to
you
at
least
in
light
of
tedder,
was
not
the
mention
sufficient
to
trigger
a
discussion
and
consideration
and
decision
based
on
it
by
the
majority
of
your
supreme
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
i’m
asking
you,
in
light
of
what
tedder
held.
unknown
speaker
as
it's
the
responsibility
of
the
supreme
court
under
the
new
florida
statute.
unknown
speaker
no.
but
the
point
was
raised.
wasn’t
it
raised
sufficiently
at
least.(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
the
dissenting
justices
--
unknown
speaker
well,
this
court
upheld
the
florida
statute
on
the
representations
of
florida
through
its
attorney
general
and
through
its
supreme
court
and
through
its
legislature
that
this
would
be
an
open
and
above
board
proceeding
and
now
we
get
to
this
case
and
there
wasn’t
one.
i
don’t
think
it's
a
matter
of
discretion
and
unless
those
three
justices
who
upheld
the
florida
statute,
on
that
basis
are
going
to
change
their
minds.
unknown
speaker
under
your
florida
rule,
yes.
unknown
speaker
it
says
the
dissenter
has
certainly
raised
this,
couldn’t
it
--
it
could
hardly
had
been
clear
on
what
he
said,
we
have
no
means
of
determining
on
review
what
role
such
confidential
information
played
in
the
trial
judges’
sentence
and
thus
i
would
overturn
appellant’s
death
sentence
on
the
basis
of
this
fundamental
error
alone
and
mr.
justice
boyd
joined
that
and
certainly
i
would
suppose
the
other
justices
of
your
court
read
the
dissenting
opinions
that
are
filed.
they
must
have
seen
that
that
was
raised,
didn’t
they?
unknown
speaker
didn’t
say
a
word
about
it,
didn’t
they?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
when
his
client
was
sentenced
to
death,
did
he?
unknown
speaker
did
the
trial
judge
indicate
publicly
that
he’d
relied
other
pre-sentence
investigation
at
all.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
general,
how
about
the
statement
that
the
subject,
it
spent
time
in
the
brig,
in
the
military,
now
that’s
not
in
the
public
portion
of
the
psi
and
how
did
he
know
that
the
judge
had
that
before
him.
it’s
a
quote
of
what
the
defendant
has
alleged
to
have
said
to
the
probation
officer
or
whoever
made
the
investigation.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
how
do
we
know
he
said.
he
didn’t
have
a
chance
to
say
that’s
what
i
said
or
that’s
different.
i
mean,
there
is
nothing
in
the
public
part
that
put
him
or
his
lawyer
unnoticed
that
the
judge
was
told
he’d
been
--
he
had
said
that.
unknown
speaker
where
did
this
court
say
that?
unknown
speaker
did
that
involve
a
pre-sentence
investigation
or
discretion
of
the
sentencing
judge?
unknown
speaker
that
involved
a
jury,
didn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
didn’t
it
involve
the
sentencing
by
the
jury
and
the
--
you
don’t
give
a
confidential
pre-sentence
investigation
to
a
jury.
unknown
speaker
that
is
evidence
on
open
court,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
that
was
the
system,
statutory
system
at
issue
in
the
woodson
case,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
trial
judge
in
arriving
at
his
sentence,
looked
at
a
pre-sentence
report
and
then
said
in
his
findings,
i
find
the
following
aggravating
circumstance
and
proceeds
to
find
an
aggravating
circumstance
and
then
says
based
upon
the
pre-sentence
report.
unknown
speaker
he
read
the
presentence
report.
he
does
not
reveal
anything
in
the
pre-sentence
report
and,
but
he
finds
an
aggravating
circumstance
based
upon
what
he
read
in
the
pre-sentence
report.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
let’s
supposed
the
case
--
let’s
suppose
--
i
said
that
suppose
a
case
--
unknown
speaker
isn't
perhaps
your
strongest
point
here
that
the
judge
guided
by
the
statute
found
an
aggravating
circumstance
based
upon
the
evidence
before
the
jury
namely
that
the
crime
was
especially
heinous
and
found
that
there
were
no
mitigating
circumstances.
that’s
all
he
found,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
allbritton
before
you
do,
one
of
the
reasons
for
not
disclosure
is
to
protect
informants
from
possible
retaliation
by
the
defendants
or
things
of
that
nature.
does
that
reason
or
does
any
reason
apply
when
the
defendant
is
to
be
killed.
unknown
speaker
when
he
is
to
be
executed
by
judicial
due
process
or
--
unknown
speaker
how
can
he
retaliate
after
this
all
takes
place.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
he
suggested,
that
was
in
total
think,
mr.
allbritton.
just
whether
or
not
he
took
it
into
consideration
--
unknown
speaker
you
made
it
very
expressly
clear
that
he
did
so.
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you,
how
could
the
pre-sentence
report
have
influenced
or
affected
the
judge's
finding
that
there
was
the
aggravating
circumstance
of
an
especially
atrocious
crime.
unknown
speaker
i
am
getting
to
that,
how
about
the
aggravating
circumstance?
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
put
that
aside
but
do
you
think
the
pre-sentence
report
might
be
relevant
to
the
establishing
a
mitigating
circumstance.
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
he
found
there
were
no
mitigating
circumstance.
unknown
speaker
suppose
he
had
no
pre-sentence
investigation
at
all
and
he
had
disagreed
with
the
jury,
he
wouldn’t
have
any
complaint
then
or
you’ll
have
a
complaint
but
not
this
one.
unknown
speaker
or
do
you
think
there
might
be
something
in
the
pre-sentence
report
affected
his
judgment
about
their
being
a
mitigating
circumstance
present
or
not.
unknown
speaker
are
you
familiar
with
the
florida
supreme
court
decisions
in
the
songer
against
state
and
swan
against
state.
