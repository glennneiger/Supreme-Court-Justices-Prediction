unknown
speaker
okay,
sure,
i
have
that
for
you?
all
of
these
services,
set
down
on
page
seven
and
eight
of
your
brief
that
you
just
run
through
for
us.
all
of
them,
you
find
violate
the
religion
clauses
of
the
first
amendment,
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
objective
f,
the
diagnostic
psychological
services.
unknown
speaker
and
the
speech
and
hearing.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kancelbaum,
what
is
the
difference
between
a
geography
book
and
a
map?
unknown
speaker
well
of
course,
you
are
making
that
claim
with
reference
to
the
textbooks
too
so
that
makes
a
little
difficult
to
lineate
your
position.
i
mean
we
have
settled
the
issue
on
textbooks.
haven't
we?
unknown
speaker
it's
quite
a
while.
unknown
speaker
in
modern
education,
just
as
we
moved
from
something
hundred
years
ago
with
a
slate
as
a
part
as
big
as
today
it's
look
like
notebook
and
the
piece
of
your
chalk,
we
moved
on
to
something
else,
not
haven't
we
moved
on
from
textbooks
to
the
use
of
close
circuit
television
and
movie
films
and
other
graphic
displays
as
the
functional
equivalence.
i
think
you
use
the
term
of
textbooks.
unknown
speaker
well,
so,
can
the
textbooks
--
can't
they,
but
surveillance
takes
care
of
them.
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
any
of
the
people
who
view
the
matter
as
your
clients
do
found
textbooks
being
furnished
in
public
schools
that
were
religiously
oriented,
they
would
be
in
federal
courts
rather
quickly,
wouldn't
they?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kancelbaum,
as
i
read
your
brief
you
do
not
go
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
the
allen
case
be
overruled,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
you
are
more
hesitant
than
other
counsel
at
times.
unknown
speaker
let's
say
you
are
more
diffident
than
other
counsel
have
been.
unknown
speaker
but
if
we
get
all
of
your
problems
and
your
call
up
to
the
chief
justice
would
be
overcome,
would
they
not?
unknown
speaker
like
burning
down
the
house
to
get
rid
of
the
mice.
unknown
speaker
may
we
come
back
a
minute
to
materials
and
equipments
and
the
public
schools
in
ohio
have
all
of
these
made
available
to
pupil?
unknown
speaker
are
you
speaking
now
of
a
mobile
annex
or
as
ballick
(ph),
when
you
use
the
term?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
apply
that
now
to
the
mobile
unit.
suppose
the
mobile
unit
with
medical
services
is
going
around
with
polio
inoculations,
for
example,
do
you
object
to
that?
unknown
speaker
the
speech
and
hearing,
do
you
think
that
falls
in
the
same
category
as
inoculation
for
polio?
unknown
speaker
while
you
are
talking
about
the
hearing
therapy,
you
mean
something
more
than
now
write
the
numbers
you
hear
in
the
third
column
i
take
it.
an
ordinary
hearing
test
certainly
does
not
involve
any
great
intimacy
between
the
therapist
and
the
patient,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
have
you
objected
that?
unknown
speaker
what
precisely
is
your
objection
to
the
diagnostic
hearing
test?
unknown
speaker
what
the
district
court
--
the
district
court
upheld
the
act.
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
there
is
a
doubt
or
a
presumption,
isn't
it
in
favor
of
the
district
count's
ruling
on
that
aspect?
unknown
speaker
for
an
ordinary
hearing
test?
unknown
speaker
you
want
to
assume
the
contrary
that
they
are
going
to
infiltrate
--
the
catholic
church
is
going
to
infiltrate
this
and
fill
the
testing
process
with
religious
dogma.
that
is
the
assumption
you
want
us
to
draw?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
us
be
realistic
and
that
is
the
largest
single
group
you
are
talking
about.
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
are
the
students
given
these
big
maps?
unknown
speaker
what
kind
of
maps
did
you
tell
about,
maps
you
put
up
on
wall?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
that
if
the
school
gets
the
parent
and
the
student
to
say
give
a
school
map,
that
takes
it
out?
unknown
speaker
don't
ask
me
to
believe
that.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
allegation
that
these
maps
are
in
some
way
tainted
through
the
religious
dogma.
unknown
speaker
just
continue,
i
am
curious
about
how
this
works
as
a
practical
matter.
let's
say
a
big
wall
map
in
a
fifth
grade
geography
class
of
30
students,
each
one
of
the
30
is
a
loanee
of
an
undivided
1/30th
interest
in
the
map.
unknown
speaker
to
an
individual
student.
unknown
speaker
he
could
take
it
home
every
night.
unknown
speaker
so,
then
i
am
right
in
my
first
assumption
that
each
one
would
be
the
lendee
of
an
undivided
1/30th
of
the
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
then
may
or
june
comes
and
they
graduate
and
go
to
the
sixth
grade,
do
they
take
the
map
with
them,
even
if
they
are
finished
studying
geography?
unknown
speaker
when
does
the
loan
cease
and
terminate?
unknown
speaker
then
it's
lent
again
the
following
year
to
the
students
in
the
fifth
grade
of
geography
classes
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
my
question.
what
is
permitted?
what
is
contemplated
under
the
state
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
individual
requests
and
i
guess
not
one
student
then
is
the
custodian
of
map
for
the
whole
class,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
perhaps,
probably
gets
promoted
in
order
to
have
stated
that
--
your
struggle
was
with
the
meek
case
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it
struggles
with
this
ohio
statute,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
martin,
if
parochial
school
a,
in
that
of
the
united
states
from
the
part
and
their
child
applies.
that
matter
replaced
by
the
city
school,
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
problem?
unknown
speaker
it
is
given
to
his
custody?
unknown
speaker
mr.
young
could
you
help
me
back,
again
on
this
public
clerk
librarian,
what
is
it?
how
does
it
in
fact
work,
do
they
have
hire
an
additional
group
of
people
who
serve
in
this
capacity
and
go
around
to
different
schools
on
a
fulltime
basis,
or
do
they
take
someone
off
the
private
school,
if
they
roam,
and
that
put
them
on
the
public
school
there.
unknown
speaker
it
essentially
it's
the
transportation?
unknown
speaker
did
you
show
that
in
this
case,
that
that
was
done?
unknown
speaker
the
diask
around
the
crusades,
have
historical
significance
independently
of
their
religious
over
time.
