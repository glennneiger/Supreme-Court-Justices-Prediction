mr.
david
j.
young
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
members
of
the
court,
i
believe
i
would
like
to
start
by
commenting
that
perhaps
one
of
the
saddest
things
with
respect
to
this
case
is
the
possibility
that
if
the
true
character
of
this
legislation
would
be
obliterated
by
either
a
failure
on
our
part
to
properly
explain
how
it
works
or
on
the
basis
of
assumed
abuses
in
administration
or
assumed
illegal
applications.
we
are
sitting
here
talking
about
annexes
to
catholic
schools
or
the
lutheran
schools
or
jury
schools,
when
the
law
permits
no
such
things.
in
briefs
we
talk
about
buying
property
from
religious
organizations
and
putting
a
mobile
unit
on
it.
that
can't
happened
under
this
act
and
unfortunately
we
are
talking
about
the
loans
that
don't
take
place
under
the
ohio
act
because
the
ohio
act
calls
for
loans
to
pupils,
materials
and
equipments
that
are
used
by
the
pupils
and
they
can't
be
used
for
any
purpose
other
than
secular
purpose.
now,
that's
what
the
ohio
act
is
all
about.
i
think,
when
we
properly
understand
the
ohio
act,
it
reflects
an
honest,
genuine,
response
to
the
concerns
in
meek.
i
submit
to
the
court,
it
reflects
a
faithful
application
of
the
principles
enunciated
in
meek
and
of
the
other,
first
amendment
cases
as
this
court
has
decided
in
the
past
decade.
if
counsel
is
permitted
to
assume
any
kind
of
abuse
that
they
would
seep
at
in
a
case,
no
state
statute
can
stand.
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
when
we
talk
about
the
statute,
we
must
talk
about
it,
as
it
is
described
on
its
face,
as
we
have
stipulation
of
the
intended
administration
and
any
reasonable
inferences
that
could
flow
there
from.
when
we
start
talking
about
speech
and
hearing
diagnostician
inculcating
religion,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
believe
we
are
just
the
beyond
the
realism
into
absurdity.
that
is
not
what
diagnostic
work
is
all
about.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
there
is
no
significant
difference
between
the
function
of
speech
and
hearing,
a
diagnostician
and
that
which
they
conceived
to
be
the
constitutional
physician,
a
nurse,
an
optometrist,
or
a
dentist.
let
me
refer,
if
i
might,
your
honor,
to
the
map
situation
that
has
been
causing
so
much
difficulty.
first
of
all,
the
only
kind
of
maps,
as
i
interpret
that
are
met
under
this
program
and
i
think
stipulations
would
this
bear
this
out,
they
have
to
have
two
characteristics,
they
have
to
be
lendable
to
child
non
divertible
to
religious
use
and
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
the
typical
map
used
today
is
a
map
with
a
cassette.
a
child
checks
out
a
maps,
he
checks
out
a
cassette,
he
plugs
in
the
cassette
to
ear
phone,
they
explain
a
to
map
to
him
and
either
the
map
is
already
filled
out
or
he
fills
out
the
map.
for
the
benefit
of
the
court,
we
have
left
with
the
clerk
of
this
court,
items
and
equipments
that
are
described
in
our
stipulation,
we
have
left
six
of
them,
going
from
the
very
smallest
to
the
most
sophisticated,
and
we
will
submit
to
the
court
that
every
single
piece
of
equipment
or
material
lend
under
this
act,
is
not
divertible
to
individual
use,
is
lent
to
the
pupil,
and
is
used
by
the
people.
the
aid
is
secular,
it
starts
with
the
child
and
it
ends
up
with
the
child.
in
terms
of
having
difficulty
with
this
act
really
meeting
the
test?
mr.
david
j.
young
may
it
please
the
court,
certainly.
mr.
david
j.
young
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
in
the
world
why
he
wouldn't
take
the
map
home.
mr.
david
j.
young
well,
surely.
mr.
david
j.
young
justice
marshall
i
am
not
talking
about
a
wall
map.
mr.
david
j.
young
that's
why
i
am
suggesting
to
the
court
that
the
maps.
mr.
david
j.
young
no,
i
am
not
talking
to
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
david
j.
young
the
record,
mr.
justice
marshall
has
a
stipulation
of
the
materials
that
were
lent
under
the
prior
program
and
then
it
says
that
with
respect
to
this
new
program,
the
materials
are
limited
in
two
respects,
over
the
prior
program.
some
of
those
listed
in
there
as
indicated
are
no
longer
able
to
be
used
either
because
they
are
divertible
number
one,
or
they
can't
be
lent
to
a
pupil.
mr.
david
j.
young
mr.
justice
marshall
i
don't
believe
the
wall
maps
are
lent
to
pupils
under
this
program.
the
only
map?
mr.
david
j.
young
it's
not
in
the
record
one
way
or
the
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
david
j.
young
there's
absolutely
no
question
because
under
the
prior
program,
we
lent
to
the
school.
mr.
david
j.
young
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
record
points
out
that
they
must,
the
only
thing
that
can
be
lent
now,
is
that
which
is
lendable
to
a
pupil
for
individual
use.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
i
have
to
say
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
would
say
yes,
but
it
depend
on
you
how
would
you
interpret
it.
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
it
is
in
the
record
where
it
is
indicated
that
the
only
materials
are
lent
under
this
program
are
materials
lent
to
pupils
and
can
be
used
by
pupils.
mr.
david
j.
young
mr.
justice
burger,
the
appellants
brought
the
lawsuit.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that,
that
is
the
case.
mr.
david
j.
young
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
wouldn;t
say
it,
if
i
weren't.
mr.
david
j.
young
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
mr.
justice
marshall,
what
i
tried
to
point
out
is
that
what
we
have
is
a
list
of
things
that
were
used
when
they
were
lent
to
the
schools
under
the
old
program.
the
ohio
general
assembly
interpreted
the
meek
decision
as
indicating
that
they
could
be
no
longer
lent
to
the
schools.
therefore,
the
classes
of
the
materials
and
equipments
that
were
lent
previously
are
now
limited
by
the
new
stipulations,
one
of
them
is
that
it
has
to
lend
able
to
a
child.
mr.
david
j.
young
may
it
please
the
court,
i
hope
so,
i
feel
very
comfortable
if
that
is
the
case.
as
i
indicated
previously,
there
are
items
of
equipments
and
materials
with
the
clerk's
office
that
are
described
in
the
stipulation,
the
court
can
proves
and
find
if
they
are
useable
by
the
child
and
they
are
quite
clearly
secular.
before
i
move
on
to
another
item,
let
me
suggest
to
the
court
and
i
know
that
difficult
question
was
put
to
mr.
martin,
are
you
having
a
difficulty
with
distinguishing
this
for
meek
in
terms
of
materials.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
as
i
read
mr.
justice
stewart's
opinion
in
meek,
as
it
looked
at
the
lending
of
materials
and
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
explained
it
in
reomer,
they
looked
at
three
things.
the
character
of
the
recipient,
the
nature
of
the
that
which
was
lent
and
the
resulting
relationships.
looking
at
these
three
features,
the
court
in
meek
said,
number
one,
the
character
of
the
recipient
is
a
religion
pervasive
institution.
the
material
itself
is
self
pleasing
and
fixed
content
secular
and
third
the
relationship
is
between
the
state
and
religious
organizations
because
it
is
a
loan
directly
to
a
religion
pervasive
organization.
now,
in
terms
of
an
honest
and
genuine
response
to
meek,
if
you
look
at
the
those
same
three
characteristics
with
respect
to
the
material
and
equipment
in
this
case,
it
is
lent
not
to
a
religion
pervasive
institution,
but
to
a
child
and
if
we
start
calling
him
a
religion
pervasive
child,
we
have
free
exercise
problems
that
are
beyond
this
case.
so,
in
this
case
we
loan
the
secular
fixed
content,
equipment
and
materials
to
a
nonreligious
pervasive
person,
a
child,
a
citizen
just
like
anyone
else.
number
two,
it
remains
fixed
content
and
secular,
it
cannot
be
used
for
religious
purpose
and
number
three,
if
you
want
to
determine,
as
mr.
chief
justice
indicated
earlier
whether
there
is
indeed
fact
that
lending
of
anything
could
conceivably
be
used
for
a
religious
purpose
that
is
all
you
would
have
to
do
is
check
with
the
treasurer
at
the
local
public
school
district.
he
has
an
inventory
of
that
which
has
been
purchased
and
that
which
is
lendable,
you
look
at
the
inventory,
you
look
at
the
catalogue
and
it
is
either
divertible
or
it
is
not.
so
in
order
to
please
the
ohio
program,
the
relationship
is
between
public
and
public.
so
i
would
submit
to
the
court
the
all
three
features.
mr.
david
j.
young
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
is
partially
correct,
there
is
less
contact
than
there
would
be
in
text
book
case.
mr.
david
j.
young
mr.
justice
stevens,
in
the
text
book
case,
it
has
been
approved
by
this
court,
both
in
allen
and
in
meek,
there
was
collective
summaries
prepared
by
the
religious
schools
and
they
pass
these
summaries
on
to
the
public
schools
so
that
occurred
in
both
allen
and
in
meek.
now,
there
is
less
of
that,
in
this
case,
because
public
school
determines
the
equipments
that
is
going
to
be
made
available
based
upon
what
it
makes
available
to
its
own
children
and
then
the
contact
between
the
public
authority
is
when
let's
say
a
teacher,
we
have
a
child
who
is
behind
in
multiplication
and
they
would
suggest
to
check
out
a
rotomatic
and
this
is
just
a
little
tube
with
the
program
unit
and
they
keep
turning
it
around
his
questions
and
answers,
the
child
goes
to
the
clerk
librarian
and
this
can
either
be
on
the
premises
or
if
it
is
the
public
school
close,
he
goes
there,
one
or
the
other.
he
goes
to
the
clerk
librarian,
he
checks
out
the
rotomatic
and
he
uses
it
for
a
week
and
he
checks
it
back
in.
now,
when
counsel
talks
about,
hey
this
loan
is
a
fiction,
we
have
pleased
the
court.
the
lending
of
equipment
would
certainly
be
much
lesser
fiction
than
the
lending
of
the
text
book.
the
text
book,
he
keep
for
a
whole
year
and
maybe
that
is
the
end
of
it.
all
of
this
equipment
is
typically,
a
repetitive
drill
kind
of
thing.
you
use
it
for
a
week,
you
do
not
need
it
any
more
unless
you
have
used
?
mr.
david
j.
young
the
statute
permits
of
two
different
situations,
depending
on
how
close
the
public
school
is.
he
either
get
it
from
a
clerk
librarian
who
is
a
public
employee,
that
clerk
librarian
under
the
statute
can
either
maintain
the
inventory
at
the
non
public
school
or
at
the
public
school
and
i
suspect
it
would
only
be
the
public
school,
if
it
were
close
by.
if
it
was
the
district
public
school,
it
would
make
sense
to
keep
it
there.
so
it
does
permit
him
to
be
on
the
non
public
premises,
but
when
the
child
check
this
out
with
equipment,
it
is
got
to
be
a
loan,
you
do
not
give
a
child
a
rotomatic
that
he
only
needs
for
a
week
that
can
be
used
by
hundreds
of
other
children.
now
counsel
has
suggested
there
is
no
lending
in
the
public
schools.
i
would
submit
to
the
court,
that
is
absurd.
if
a
child
wants
to
use
a
rotomatic
multiplication
machine
in
the
public
school,
if
the
public
school
is
going
to
give
it
to
him,
say,
this
is
yours,
keep
it,
when
he
only
needs
it
for
a
few
days?
it
is
lent
to
the
child
in
the
public
school
just
like
in
the
non
public
school,
he
uses
it,
he
turns
it
back
in
and
another
child
uses
it.
mr.
david
j.
young
very
definitely,
your
honor,
the
same
thing
is
true.
almost,
all
of
this
equipment
that's
used
--
i
know
that
it
is
hard
for
us
to
visualize
it
because
we
did
not
have
it
when
we
were
in
school,
almost
all
of
it
is
drill,
repetitive,
tutorial
kind
of
equipment;
some
kids
can
use
the
textbook
in
the
lecture
when
they
catch
on.
most
need
this
assistance
and
they
go
back
in,
and
all
of
its
individual
use.
even
the
machines,
only
one
child
uses
it.
and
it's
programmed
especially
for
one
child
use.
you
will
see
the
--
in
terms
of
the
equipment,
you
start
out
with
the
smallest
little
tubes,
they
call
them
rotomatics.
they
have
programmed
plastic
courses
inside
and
they
simply
turn
and
it
drills
them.
they
have
a
little
hand
calculator
that
does
the
same
thing
for
any
of
the
secular
courses.
then
you
move
to
a
little
machine,
where
you
push
button
that
programs,
correct
answers
at
programs
how
fast
you
can
do
it
and
then
you
move
right
on
up
from
the
most
--
the
smallest
item
until
the
largest
and
in
response
to
justice
marshall's
earlier
question,
some
of
them
you
can
take
on
no
question
about
it.
i
do
not
think
anyone
would
suggest
to
this
court.
mr.
david
j.
young
justice
marshall,
it
would
initially
?
mr.
david
j.
young
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
would
delivered
either
to
the
non
public
school
or
the
public
school
and
then
the
child
must
go
to
the
clerk
library
and
check
it
out
and
check
it
back
in.
mr.
david
j.
young
mr.
justice
marshall,
very
definitely
not,
it
would
be
given
to
a
public
clerk
librarian
?
mr.
david
j.
young
that's
correct.
mr.
david
j.
young
mr.
justice
marshall,
he
either
goes
to
the
public
library
or
to
non
public
school
depending
on
where
it
is
kept.
mr.
david
j.
young
it
would
be
delivered
by
the
public
school
to
a
public
clerk
librarian
who
would
have
an
inventory
there.
mr.
david
j.
young
by
the
public
authorities
at
the
local
public
school
district
or
the
purchaser
or
the
seller
would
deliver
it
to
the
public
school,
they
would
inventory
it,
then
if
it
happened
to
be
stored
at
the
non
public
school,
they
would
give
it
to
the
clerk
librarian.
mr.
david
j.
young
either
the
shipper
or
the
local
public
school
would
take
it
there.
mr.
david
j.
young
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
believed,
one
ingredient
i
have
not
explained
about
the
program,
is
that
they
get
the
same
equipment
that
is
available
in
the
public
school,
okay?
in
other
words,
if
--
say
that
school,
if
nearby
there
is
a
public
school,
whatever
equipment
they
have
that
is
going
to
available
for
the
non
public
school
child,
same
equipment
okay?
now,
what
a
child
uses
on
a
given
occasion
depends
on
his
particular
deficiency,
if
he
has
a
multiplication
problem,
then
what
he
will
check
out
is
a
little
rotomatic
that
helps
him
drill
in
multiplication.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
respectfully
disagree,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
david
j.
young
well
pardon
me,
but
we
read
it
differently,
he
gets
it
from
the
publicly
hired
and
controlled
clerk
librarian
who
has
custody
of
it
and
checks
it
in
and
checks
it
out,
just
like
going
to
a
library
?
mr.
david
j.
young
perhaps,
yes
no
question
about
that...
mr.
david
j.
young
it
can
be
your
honor,
can
be.
mr.
david
j.
young
he
can
be
and
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that
in
our
opinion
your
honor.
i
think
basically
what
we
are
talking
about
here
are
the
evils
of
which
the
establishment
clause
are
designed
to
prevent.
mr.
david
j.
young
the
administrative
program
would
not
permit
them
to
take
them
off
of
a
private
school
payroll,
they
would
have
to
be
a
public
employee
and
i
maybe
be
going
beyond
the
record
but
i
know
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
there
will
be
no
hiring
of
a
private
teacher?
i
do
not
remember
whether
that
kind
of
stipulation.
mr.
david
j.
young
justice
stevens,
this
would
depend
if
there
is
a
closed
public
school
nearby?.
mr.
david
j.
young
that
he
would
be
stationed
at
the
non
public
school,
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
that?s
certainly
true,
but
your
honor,
except
that,
if
it
is
a
large
school
with
--
other
than
the
rural
school,
the
large
school
is
going
to
have
enough
equipment
and
the
children
are
going
to
be
checking
it
in
and
out
frequently
enough
that
the
clerk
would
probably
have
to
be
there
all
the
time,
so
i
think
there
would
be
less
mobility
and
to
be
honest,
in
the
clerk
librarian
than
there
would
be
the
school
nurse,
i
think
there
would
be
less
mobility.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
have
very
little
time,
let
me,
i
have
talked
about
the
materials
and
equipment,
talking
just
for
a
moment
about
the
therapeutic
personnel.
it
seems
what
ohio
has
done,
it
solved
the
problems
that
were
created
in
earley
v.
dicenso
and
meek.
it's
taken
any
--
even
though
there
are
auxiliary
service
personnel.
this
court
has
said
there
is
a
possibility
they
would
perform
education
services,
so
now,
they
are
hired
by
the
public,
they
are
controlled
by
the
public,
they
are
auxiliary
personnel
and
they
perform
their
services
at
public
facilities.
a
counsel
in,
opposing
counsel
in
their
brief
has
suggested
even
so,
they
must
be,
these
children
must
be
denied
that
secular
service
because
they
are
sectarian
children
and
when
they
go
to
that
public
facility
they
are
going
to
intimidate
the
speech
and
hearing
therapist
and
turn
him
into
a
religion
teacher.
this
particular
branch
of
the
argument,
i
think
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
dangerous
assertions
that
has
been
made
before
this
court
in
any
of
the
first
amendment
non
public
education
cases,
that
has
been
before
this
court
in
the
last
ten
years.
for
now,
we
have
the
ultimate,
not
a
religion
pervasive
school,
not
a
religion
pervasive
building,
but
a
religion
pervasive
child,
a
citizen
who
is
marked
because
of
the
fact
that
he
a
catholic
or
lutheran,
a
jewish
or
a
christian
child
and
because
of
that
fact
and
that
alone
he
may
not
go
to
a
public
facility
and
get
the
same
kind
of
neutral
secular
service
that
any
other
child
in
this
community.
if
that
proposition
can
be
adopted,
what
about
the
lutheran
parent
who
gets
social
security?
we
know
he
does
not
get
it
because
he
is
a
lutheran
but
he
happens
to
be
a
lutheran.
i
would
suggest
to
the
members
of
the
court,
that
even
though
some
of
the
clients
i
represent,
whose
children
are
catholic,
lutheran,
christian
or
jewish,
to
be
sure
they
get
therapy,
they
get
speech
and
hearing
therapy
at
a
public
facility,
but
they
do
not
get
it
because
they
are
catholic,
or
lutheran
or
christian
or
jewish,
they
get
it
because
they
are
a
child
in
need
and
they
get
it
because
they
are
a
citizen
just
like
any
other
child
and
i
respectfully
suggest
to
this
court
that
what
we
have
in
the
ohio
program
is
a
neutral
program
of
assistance
of
secular
assistance
that
applies
to
all
in
the
community
and
applies
alike.
now
to
be
sure
if
there
is
not
enough
room
in
the
public
school
facility
then
the
non
public
school
child
might
get
the
service
in,
let
us
say
in
a
library
room
rather
than
a
public
school
classroom,
we
suggest
that
makes
no
difference
in
terms
of
establishment
clause
principles.
this
court,
justice
douglas
in
the
zorach
case,
when
the
non
public
school
pupils
were
released
from
a
public
school,
they
go
to
attend
a
religious
instruction.
justice
douglas
pointed
out,
the
establishment
clause
does
not
require
such
hostility
that
we
can
make
no
accommodation
whatsoever
for
these
children,
so
the
release
time
program
was
approved
there,
i
would
suggest
that
the
mere
fact,
that
the
lutheran
or
catholic
or
jewish
child
receives
his
speech
and
hearing
therapy
in
a
library
room
rather
than
a
public
school
because
the
public
school
does
not
have
room
or
is
not
close
enough
makes
absolutely
no
difference
from
an
establishment
clause
of
view
point.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
i
think
we
have
here
in
this
ohio
program
first
of
all
we
pointed
out.
my
time
is
up,
i
appreciate.
mr.
david
j.
young
justice
stewart,
that
is
correct
it
is
suggested
that
there
would
be
some
additional
administrative
entanglement
with
field
trip
transportation
that
would
not
exist
in
school
bus
transportation.
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
would
be
far
less
entanglement
that's
all
we
would
is
a
month
ahead
of
time,
'x'
school
would
say,
we
want
to
take
the
same
kind
of
field
trip
that
the
public
school
took.
mr.
david
j.
young
justice
stewart
they
are
only
field
trips
that
are
available
to
the
public
school.
they
cannot
be
field
trips
that
are
not
made
available
to
the
public
school
child
so
they
would
be
the
same
program
and
i
do
not
think
there
would
be
anymore
entanglement
and
i
do
feel
it
certainly,
if
we
can
transport
to
a
religious
school
in
everson
that
we
ought
to
be
able
to
transport
to
a
neutral
scientific
or
governmental
center.
mr.
david
j.
young
yeah
it
is
just
simply
the
transportation
and
it
must
be
the
same
just
like
everything
else
in
the
act
the
same
is
to
public
school
child
thank
you.
