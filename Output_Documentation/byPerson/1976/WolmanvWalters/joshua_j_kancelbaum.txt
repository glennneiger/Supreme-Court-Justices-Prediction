mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
joshua
kancelbaum
arguing
on
behalf
of
appellants.
the
appellants
in
this
case
are
taxpayers
of
the
state
of
ohio,
who
are
appealing
a
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
ohio
which
upheld
the
establishment
clause
validity
of
ohio's
latest
statute
which
provides
massive
aid
to
the
non
public
elementary
and
secondary
education
in
ohio.
the
massive
aid,
i
referred
to
amounts
to
funding
of
in-excessive
$88
million
for
the
biennial.
this
case
presents
variations
on
the
theme
explored
in
1975
by
this
court
in
meek
v.
pittenger,
and
indeed
the
statute
here
challenged
which
is
codified
as
ohio,
revised
code
section
3317.06
and
which
we
have
generally
referred
to
on
a
brief
senate
bill
170
was
enacted
in
direct
response
to
this
court's
decision
in
meek
v.
pittenger.
at
that
time,
we
had
an
appeal
pending
before
this
court
from
the
predecessor
ohio
statute
which
was
virtually
identical
to
the
one
decided
in
meek
v.
pittenger.
a
few
days
after
the
meek
decision,
this
court
remanded
that
appeal
on
the
ohio
law
for
further
proceedings
and
the
response
was
the
repeal
of
that
law
and
the
enactment
of
the
present
law.
the
current
ohio
law
provides
following
programs;
section
a:
text
book
loans,
sections
b
and
c:
material
and
equipments
loans,
section
d:
speech
and
hearing
diagnostic
services,
section
e,
physician,
nursing,
dental
and
optometric
services
which
incidentally
we
do
not
challenge,
section
f:
diagnostic
psychological
services,
section
g:
therapeutic
psychological
and
speech
and
hearing
services;
section
h:
guidance
and
counseling
services,
section
i:
remedial
services,
section
j:
standardized
test
and
scoring
services,
section
k:
programs
for
the
deaf,
blind
and
emotionally
disturbed,
coupled,
and
physically
handicapped
and
finally
section
l:
field
trip
transportation.
it
is
our
contention
that
acceptance
so
far
as
the
narrow
physically
oriented
health
services
are
concerned,
all
of
these
programs
follow
the
establishment
cause.
the
essential
pattern
in
this
case
which
differentiates
it
from
meek
v.
pittenger
is
basically
that
as
far
as
equipment
and
material
loans
are
concerned,
the
present
law
purports
on
paper
to
make
these
loans
to
pupils
or
parents
rather
than
outright
loans
to
the
educational
institution
and
in
so
far
as
the
services
are
concerned,
the
services
are
now
dichotomized
so
that
diagnostic
services
are
performed
on
the
parochial
premises
as
they
were
under
previous
laws
considered
by
this
court
whereas
the
so
called
therapeutic
services
are
now
moved
at
least
some
minimum
distance
beyond
the
walls
of
the
non
public
schools.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
all
except
physician,
nursing,
dental
and
optometric
your
honor,
except
to
the
extent
that
therapeutic
services
are
permitted
under
this
act
to
be
performed
on
a
public
school
premises
as
part
of
the
general
program
applied
across
the
board
to
pupils
in
the
public
and
non
public
schools.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
yes,
your
honor,
those
are
the
two
categories
of
the
diagnostic
services
we
object
to
the
speech
and
hearing
and
the
psychological.
in
our
judgment,
these
services
are
materially
different
from
the
other
diagnostic
services
and
that
they
are
far
more
subjective.
they
are
framed
under
the
law
in
a
very
loose
fashion
which
permits
a
large
degree
of
unrestricted
intercommunication
between
the
diagnostician
and
the
person
receiving
the
diagnosis.
so
that
--
at
the
risk
of
skipping
ahead
for
a
moment,
what
we
have
is
--
and
the
record
is
clear
as
far
as
psychological
diagnostics
are
concerned,
interviewing
and
projective
procedures
are
specifically
mentioned
in
the
stipulation
and
guidelines
and
so
far
as
these
items
are
concerned
what
it
amounts
to
is
government
employees
evaluating
the
attitudes,
behavior
etcetera
of
children
in
a
church
school
and
that
this
is
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
the
establishment
clause.
non
public
education
in
ohio
as
it
has
been
where
this
court
has
considered
similar
types
of
statutes
arriving
in
other
states,
is
overwhelmingly
sectarian
and
in
fact
of
some
262,628
nonpublic
pupils
enrolled
in
ohio
during
the
1974-75
school
year.
243,545
were
enrolled
in
the
catholic
schools,
only
8700
were
enrolled
in
nonsectarian
schools,
of
720
non-public
schools
throughout
ohio
only
29
were
nonsectarian.
the
court
below
determined
that
although
there
were
perhaps
some
differences
between
the
conduct
of
sectarian
education
ohio
and
the
profile
which
appeared
in
this
court's
opinion
in
meek
v.
pittenger.
sectarian
education
in
ohio
was
substantially
comparable
to
what
this
court
found
to
be
the
situation
in
lemon
v.
kurtzman
and
indeed,
this
court
in
affirming
the
successful
challenges
by
these
appellants
of
previous
ohio,
measures
to
provide
sectarian
aid
in
wolman
v.
essex
and
grit
v.
wolman,
which
arose
on
similar
stipulated
records,
in
effect
held
that
sectarian
education
in
ohio
is
subject
to
the
same
structures
as
applied
in
pennsylvania,
new
york,
new
jersey
and
indeed
appellees
have
considered
that
because
of
the
religious
mission
of
these
schools.
they
are
defending
the
statue
based
upon
its
secularity
and
not
upon
any
differences
between
sectarian
education
in
ohio
and
elsewhere.
turning
to
the
material
and
equipment
loan
provisions.
there
are
essentially
three
distinctions
between
these
provisions
and
the
provisions
considered
by
this
court
in
meek
v.
pittenger.
first,
there
is
a
clause
in
the
ohio
statue
which
says
that,
'materials
which
are
capable
of
diversion
to
religious
purposes
cannot
be
loaned.'
secondly,
there
is
the
provision
which
i
alluded
to
earlier
that
loans
are
to
be
made
to
pupils
or
parents
and
thirdly,
unlike
the
previous
statues
in
marburger
and
meek.
the
implementation
of
the
equipment
and
the
material
loans
is
to
be
accomplished
with
the
assistance
of
publicly
paid
staff
which
goes
on
--
which
is
authorized
to
go
on
to
parochial
school
premises
to
do
such
things
as
collect,
catalog,
distribute
and
store
the
equipment
and
materials.
dealing
with
the
first
of
these
distinctions
first,
the
divertible
to
religious
purposes
clause,
all
that
does
is
put
this
case
in
exactly
the
same
posture
as
far
as
equipment
and
the
material
loans
are
concerned
that
meek
v.
pettinger
was
in,
when
it
arrived
at
this
court,
because
the
district
court
in
meek
v.
pettinger
had
already
held
that
the
pennsylvania
act
was
invalid
under
the
establishment
clause
and
so
far
as
it
permitted
equipment
and
materials
which
were
capable
of
diversion
to
religious
purposes
to
be
so
loaned.
what
this
court
did
was
strike
down
these
provisions
and
so
far
as
they
authorized
the
lending
of
materials
which
was
ostensibly
of
fixed
neutral
content
on
its
face.
dealing
with
the
loan
concept,
the
pupil
loan
concept,
we
must
first
commence
with
the
understanding
that
the
very
same
equipment
and
materials
which
were
to
be
loaned
loan
under
the
prior
ohio
act
which
were
substantially
the
same
as
the
equipment
and
materials
which
were
to
be
loaned
in
meek
v.
pettinger
are
available
under
this
enactment.
the
stipulated
record
contains
a
list
of
the
items
which
were
furnished
under
the
prior
ohio
act
and
it
is
agreed
that
these
same
materials
except
to
the
extent
that
the
incapable
of
the
diversion
clause
can
have
some
affect
will
be
loaned
again
and
these
includes
such
items
as
wall
maps,
science
labs,
expensive
pieces
of
electronic
equipment.
the
point
is
that
we
are
not
simply
handing
out
items
which
are
the
functional
equivalent
of
textbooks
here
and
the
applicable
principle,
i
think
was
well
set
by
this
court
in
its
consideration
of
committee
for
public
education
v.
nyquist,
when
this
court
determined
that
a
mere
conduit
device
saying
that
you
are
giving
or
lending
the
benefit
to
the
pupils
or
to
the
parents
does
not
suffice
to
evade
the
function
and
effect
of
the
enactment.
the
meek
rationale
which
is
equally
applicable
to
this
statute
as
it
was
to
the
pennsylvania
statute
considered
in
meek
v.
pittenger
was
that
substantial
aid
and
i
am
quoting
from
the
meek
opinion
now,
on
page
23
of
our
brief,
part
of
page
seven,
i
am
sorry
657
of
the
meek
opinion,
"substantial
aid
to
the
educational
function
of
such
schools,
accordingly,
necessarily
results
in
aid
to
the
sectarian
enterprise
as
a
whole."
this
factor
does
not
change
whether
you
call
this
a
loan
to
the
pupils
or
whether
you
call
it
a
loan
to
the
schools.
now,
we
are
left
with
the
necessity
of
harmonizing
this
aspect
of
the
case
with
board
of
education
v.
allen
and
the
textbook
portion
of
the
meek
opinion.
part
of
our
burden
is
of
course,
to
ask
this
court
to
overrule
those
textbooks
decisions,
we
have
always
felt
that
they
were
not
in
harmony
with
the
other
holdings
of
this
court
under
the
establishment
clause
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
overrule
board
of
education
v.
allen
to
reach
this
result.
there
are
practical
distinctions
between
the
materials
and
equipment
on
the
one
hand
and
the
textbooks
on
the
other.
first
of
all,
there
is
a
history
in
ohio
of
lending
textbooks
to
public
school
pupils
as
well
as
parochial
school
pupils,
the
applicable
statute
is
section
3329.06
where
in
the
board
of
education,
treat
the
furnishing
of
textbooks
of
public
school
pupils
as
a
loan.
there
is
no
comparable
statute
for
the
treatment
of
material
and
equipment.
in
public
schools
as
a
loan
to
the
pupils.
no
one
would
ever
think
of
calling
these
items
collective
loans
to
the
pupils,
a
wall
map
a
loan
to
the
pupils,
but
for
the
evident
necessity
of
getting
around
this
court's
opinion
in
meek.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
your
honor,
first
of
all,
i
mean
for
these
purposes.
for
these
purposes
if
the
items
such
as
a
map
is
not
given
to
the
pupil
to
carry
or
about
with
him,
to
perhaps
take
home,
there
is
something
very
stretched
about
the
notion
of
calling
it
a
pupil
benefit.
i
agree,
that
it
makes
still
more
sense,
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
and
as
far
as
the
clients
i
represent
are
concerned
to
say
that
the
textbook
going
to
the
core
of
religious
education
also
are
not
be
furnished
in
parochial
schools
at
state
expense
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
that
because
the
distinction
remains
valid.
moreover,
here
we
have
a
case
where
the
statute
broadly
authorizes
all
kinds
of
materials
and
equipments
to
be
furnished,
the
state
department
of
education
passes
some
guidelines,
then
throws
the
matter
under
the
statute
to
the
administrations
of
600
and
add
some
local
school
districts
who
may
consult
with
the
33
field
coordinators
in
the
implementation
of
the
act.
the
notion
that
the
pristine
distinctions
we
make
here,
will
find
their
way
in
to
what
is
actually
done
under
this
act,
is
i
think
not
consistent
with
the
facts.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
your
honor,
what
i
fear,
the
danger
in
that
would
be
is
that
the
gravenment
of
our
complaint
as
taxpayers
under
flast
v.
cohen
is
that
the
expenditure
of
this
money
ab
initio
violates
our
first
amendment
rights.
now.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
at
least
for
the
time
being.
i
suppose
your
honor
but?
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
but,
at
least
we
know
that
a
textbook
is
a
textbook.
under
an
act
like
this
all
kinds
of
things
are
authorized
and
this
gets
part
and
parcel
into
the
concept,
that
in
this
case
the
state
has
not
met
its
obligation
to
ensure
that
religion
will
not
be
inculcated
and
that
excessive
entanglement
will
not
occur.
when
it
passes
an
act
which
in
effect
passes
the
administration
to
the
far-flung
local
school
districts
without
any
policing,
without
any
system
of
surveillance
which
of
course,
would
presents
its
own
excessive
entanglement
problems.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
appellees
used
the
term,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
statute,
first
of
all,
goes
far
beyond
the
functional
equivalent
of
textbooks
and
deals
with
matters
which
are
historically
classroom
rather
than
pupil
equipment
and
secondly
i
think
the
argument
proves
too
much
because
the
equipments
such
as
close
circuit
television
can
be
as
readily
employed
to
video
cast,
a
religious
show
as
a
secular
one.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
your
honor,
i
think
there
has
been
no
surveillance
in
the
textbook
cases,
the
court
has
made
the
assumption
that
the
textbooks
being
of
fixed
content
and
secular
ones
would
stay
that
way.
it
hasn't
done
that
on
the
equipment
materials
case.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
oh,
your
honor,
if
we
were
to
have
to
take
these
cases
on
an
applied
basis,
we
would
be
in
federal
court
not
only
quickly
but
incessantly
and
every
day
and
forever,
just
on
the
school
prayer
decisions
along,
we
could
be
in
federal
court
in
88
counties
constantly.
it
is
essential
that
this
court
continue
its
pattern
of
making
facial
adjudications
in
this
area,
leaving
clear
guidelines
as
to
what
can
and
cannot
be
furnished
and
making
it
abundantly
clear,
the
state
must
when
and
enact
these
statutes,
ensure
the
secularity.
the
usual
burden
upon
one,
was
challenging
the
constitutionality
in
this
area
where
aid
is
given
by
a
willing
donor
to
a
willing
recipient
and
those
who
are
concerned
about
the
spending
of
their
tax
dollars
for
religious
purposes
are
not
parties
to
the
transaction.
the
placing
of
the
burden
on
them
to
police
these
enactments,
is
as
far
as
i
conceive,
the
end
of
the
establishment
clause
in
this
area.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
yes,
your
honor,
we
have
gone
that
far
but
we
have
recognized
that
in
view
of
the
meek
opinion
last
year,
that
is
asking
rather
a
lot
and
we
have
also
indicated
the
ways
in
which
the
allen
case
can
be
harmonized.
but
i
might
say
it
is
well.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
oh,
we
would
love
to
have
the
overrule
of
allen,
your
honor.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
i
think
many
of
them
would
be
envied.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
well,
your
honor.
i
with
all
respect,
i
wonder
which
is
the
allen
case.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
i
examined
the
title
33
over
the
weekend
looking
for
this
and
as
nearly
as
i
can
determine,
it
emerges
from
the
general
power
of
the
boards
of
education
which
has
this
court
noted
in
the
mt.
healthy
case
recently,
is
a
quasi
autonomous
body,
to
acquire
personality
and
to
equip
classrooms
and
i
might
add
that
the
--
should
the
court
desire,
i
would
be
most
happy
to
furnish
a
supplemental
memorandum
on
this
point,
but
there
is
no
comparable
statue
for
the
lending
of
materials
and
equipment
as
opposed
to
text
books.
now,
turning
to
the
problem
of
the
on-premises
diagnostic
services,
i
would
have
that
remarks
the
which
appellants
made
considering
the
psychological
services
apply
at
least
to
an
extent,
the
speech
and
hearing
services
as
well
because
the
definition
in
the
statue
is
unrestricted.
there
is
no
requirement
that
only
standardized
test
be
furnished
and
again
the
opportunity
for
abuse
is
there.
a
diminished
probability
under
meek
that
sectarian
infusion
will
take
place
as
an
insufficient
safe
guard
and
the
good
faith
of
these
personnel
is
also
under
meek
and
insufficient
item
to
be
relied
upon
by
the
state.
now,
when
we
get
to
therapeutic
services,
the
position
becomes
somewhat
different.
first
of
all
it
is
clear
that
these
are
services
which
could
not
under
meek
v.
pettinger,
be
furnished
on
parochial
school
premises.
so
the
question
arises,
of
what
effect
is
removing
them
to
the
three
categories
of
institution
which
they
can
be
performed.
they
can
be
performed
on
public
school
premises,
so
called
public
centers,
or
in
mobile
units,
parked
off
the
premises
but
close
by,
in
effect
to
the
curb
side.
now,
i
repeat
that
appellants
do
not
object
to
what
professor
froined
writing
in
the
1969
harvard
law
review
article
referred
to
in
our
brief
and
repeatedly
in
decisions
of
this
court
said,
was
shared
time
which
--
as
he
put,
it
was
the
limit
to
which
our
policy
of
neutrality
toward
religion
can
carry
us.
to
the
extent
that
this
type
of
therapeutic
service
program
can
be
affected
across
the
board
as
part
of
a
genuine
general
program
either
in
a
public
school
or
in
a
facility
which
is
truly
made
available
for
that
service
to
general
community
of
which
the
parochial
school
pupils
are
a
part,
we
do
not
object.
we
do
object
to
public
facilities
which
really
are
not
public
facilities
at
all
but
are
special
satellite
facilities
furnished
by
the
public
for
the
special
use
of
the
parochial
facilities,
in
effect
public
annexes
to
church
schools.
we
see
a
great
danger
that
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
scheme
that
this
statue
engenders.
first
of
all..
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
your
honor,
i
think
that
both
of
those
are
possible
that
the
term
annex
applies
in
equal
course
to
both
of
them.
the
matter
is
not
far
fetched,
in
our
brief,
i
have
cited
the
case
of
is
moore
v.
board
of
education,
which
is
an
example
arising
out
of
common
pleas
court
in
real
community
in
ohio,
mercer
county,
of
a
permanent
church
school
annex
in
which
the
public
school
stationed
next
to
the
parochial
school
and
the
entire
administration
of
to
(inaudible)
client
that
is
the
trial
judge
found,
the
pupils
would
no
way
of
knowing
when
they
were
receiving
services
in
one
on
one,
and
when
or
what
they
are
were
receiving
in
the
other.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
your
honor,
i
do
not
object
to
the
polio
inoculations,
if
they
are
performed
by
the
medical
personnel
on
the
parochial
school
premises,
on
the
other
hand.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
speech
are
hearing
therapy
involves
an
ongoing
relationship
between
the
therapist
and
the
pupil
which
is
similar
in
character
to
remedial
reading,
guidance,
counseling
and
what
have
you
and
that
when
that
mobile
unit
parks
at
the
church
gates
and
makes
itself
available
and
it
is
stipulated
that
while
it
is
parked
there,
it
would
be
most
unusual
for
that
facility
to
be
performing
services
or
anything
other
than
the
sectarian
school,
which
it
is
parked
next
to,
when
it
is
parked
there,
i
think
every
bit
of
opportunity
for
sectarian
influence,
in
that
situation
that
was
present
in
meek
v.
pettinger
remains
present.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
your
honor,
what
you
have
described
will
be
classified
under
this
act,
not
as
therapy
but
as
diagnosis.
that
can
take
place
under
this
act
on
the
parochial
school
premises.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
yes,
your
honor,
but
for
definitional
reasons,
if
all
that
were
being
given
here,
were
standardized
tests,
we
would
have
more
of
a
problem
with
that
aspect
of
the
hearing
diagnosis.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
my
objection
is
that
although
the,
appellees
assert
that
only
standardized
speech
and
hearing
diagnostic
tests
are
available
under
this
act,
that
is
not
spelled
out
anywhere.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
yes.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
your
honor,
i
think
that's
given
the
query,
the
record,
in
this
case
this
court
can
come
to
its
own
conclusion,
as
the
kinds
of
potentials
involved
in
sectarian
advancement
and
excessive
entanglement
under
this
act.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
your
honor,
the
notion
that
it
is
an
ordinary
hearing
test
which
will
be
administered
under
the
blanket
caption,
speech
and
hearing
diagnosis
is
an
assumption.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
first
of
all,
your
honor,
i
would
by
no
means
limit
this
or
even
emphasize
this
as
a
catholic
problem
but.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
it
is
the
largest
group
but
it
is
by
no
means
the
only
group,
your
honor.
yes
we
feel
that
it
is
the
obligation
of
the
state
to
ensure
that
these
items
are
secular.
thank
you.
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
thank
your
honor,
it
appears
to
me
that
adverse
counsel,
has
proved
too
much
with
that
map
example.
when
i
went
to
sunday
school
we
used
maps
all
of
the
time.
maps
are
not
like
textbooks
having
a
fixed
content
which
is
principally
useful
on
a
given
context.
you
can
track
the
growth
of
and
development
of
judaism
through
the
diask
around
the
map,
you
can
track
the
crusades
in
a
sectarian
oriented
course
on
a
map
and
this
?
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
we
do
not
need
to
show
that
it
was
done
in
this
case
your
honor
because
here
we
are
giving
to
a
'for
use
in
a
religious
school
an
item
which
is
divertible
to
a
religious
purpose,
the
state
does
not'
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
of
course
your
honor
but
in
the
context
of
a
sectarian
school
these
are
useful
tools
in
the
teaching
of
religion
and?
mr.
joshua
j.
kancelbaum
yes,
your
honor,
in
fact
i
recall
that
you
have
already
decided
a
map
case.
turning
away
from
the
example,
the
fact
is
that
the
statute,
the
guidelines,
the
stipulation
are
all
silent
as
to
the
notion
that
only
items
capable
of
individual
used
by
pupils
are
to
be
loaned.
we
think
another
area
where
adverse
counsel
has
proved
too
much
lies
in
the
fact
that
we
have
before
us
clearly
is
the
opportunity
for
the
creation
of
a
public
lending
library
in
a
parochial
school,
we
think
that
little
argument
is
involved
in
stressing
the
notion,
if
there
is
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
the
establishment
clause
in
this.
finally,
we
do
not
label
children
as
sectarian
children
because
they
leave
a
church
school
to
go
to
a
secular
service
off
premises.
we
simply
point
out
that
the
place
where
they
are
going
is
not
truly
a
public
place,
if
it's
put
there
simply
to
serve
them
and
were
comparable
services
available
to
the
public
general,
or
have
then
a
very
different
matter.
as
far
as
the
influence
upon
the
secular
personnel
is
concerned,
it
is
not
the
little
child
who
is
going
to
create
a
sectarian
influence
upon
the
supposedly
secular
personnel.
it
would
be
the
entire
way
that
the
establishment,
next
to
which
that
mobile
unit
is
parked.
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
repeatedly
the
defendants
in
this
case
have
responded
the
decisions
of
this
court
by
viewing
them
as
a
challenge
to
greater
ingenuity
to
a
new
way
to
get
around
the
last
decision.
we
submit
that
there
is
nothing
surprising
under
the
establisment
clause
that
aid
to
secetarian
schools
cannot
be
funded
by
the
state.
thank
you.
