justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
case
comes
to
us
by
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
southern
district
of
ohio
and
it
is
yet
another
case
in
--
of
drawing
line
concerning
an
attempt
by
the
state,
this
time
ohio,
to
provide
state
funds
to
aid
pupils
in
church-related
elementary
and
secondary
schools.
admittedly,
the
ohio
statute,
this
is
an
attempt
to
conform
to
the
principles
laid
down
and
a
case
here
couple
of
years
ago
called
meek
against
pittenger,
but
it
is
challenged
as
violative
of
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution
which
is
applicable
to
the
states
to
the
medium
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
attack
is
on
a
statute
as
six-fold.
namely,
the
expenditure
of
state
funds
for
the
purchase
of
textbooks,
the
expenditure
of
funds
to
provide
parochial
school
children,
the
standardized
test
and
scoring
services
as
are
used
in
the
public
schools
of
the
state.
thirdly,
funds
to
provide
speech
and
hearing
diagnostic
services
and
diagnostic
psychological
services
to
children
in
the
non-public
schools
themselves.
and
fourthly,
funds
for
the
therapeutic
guidance
and
remedial
services
for
students
identified
as
having
a
need
for
specialized
attention
with
the
personnel
supplying
the
services
to
be
employees,
however,
of
the
local
board
of
education
and
with
the
services
to
be
performed
only
in
public
schools
wherein
public
centers
or
in
mobile
units
located
off
the
non-public
school
premises.
fifth,
funds
for
the
purchase
and
loan
to
pupils
are
their
parents
of
instructional
materials
and
instructional
equipment
of
the
kind
use
in
the
public
schools.
and
sixth,
funds
to
provide
field
trip
transportation
with
a
choice
of
field
trips
to
be
made
by
the
non-public
school
teachers
from
a
wide
range
of
locations.
the
three-judge
federal
district
court
upheld
the
statute
in
all
respects.
the
opinion
filed
today
is
divided
into
several
parts
dealing
respectively
with
the
six
expenditure
classifications
under
challenge.
in
summary,
the
court
here
sustains
the
ohio
statute
insofar
as
it
concerns
textbooks
and
tests
and
the
furnishing
of
diagnostic
and
therapeutic
services.
we
hold,
however,
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
insofar
as
the
instructional
materials
and
instructional
equipment
are
concerned
and
also
with
respect
to
the
field
trips.
thus,
the
judgment
of
the
three-judge
federal
district
court
is
affirmed
in
part
and
reversed
in
part.
the
opinion
i
filed
today
is
joined
in
its
entirety
only
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
and
those
parts
thereof
which
relate
to
textbooks
and
tests
are
also
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
powell.
that
part
relating
to
diagnostic
services
is
also
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
marshall,
mr.
justice
powell
and
mr.
justice
stevens.
and
that
part
relating
to
the
therapeutic
services
is
also
joined
by
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
powell
and
mr.
justice
stevens.
and
those
parts
holding
the
provisions
as
to
equipment
and
materials
and
field
trips
to
be
unconstitutional
are
also
joined
mr.
justice
brennan,
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
stevens.
justices
brennan,
marshall,
powell
and
stevens
each
have
filed
opinions
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
have
filed
a
joint
statement
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
the
judgment.
