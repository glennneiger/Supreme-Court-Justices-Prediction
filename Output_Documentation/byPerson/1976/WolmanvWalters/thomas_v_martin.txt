mr.
thomas
v.
martin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
ohio
has
included
non-public
school
children
in
programs
providing
education
materials
and
auxiliary
services
since
1967,
and
although
this
court
in
the
meek
case,
struck
down
programs
providing
similar
benefits,
we
did
not
interpret
that
decision
as
prohibiting
all
programs
providing
such
benefit.
the
opinion
of
self
states
that
the
authority
in
the
state
to
furnish
free
auxiliary
services
to
all
students
in
the
state
including
non
public
school
students
was
neither
challenged,
nor
question,
and
in
the
later
roemer
case,
the
opinion
states
that
religious
institutions
themselves
need
not
be
quarantined
from
public
benefits,
neutrally
available
to
all.
we
therefore
assume
that
children
attending
religious
institutions
need
not
be
quarantined
from
such
benefits.
the
state
of
ohio
enacted
the
present
statute,
in
order
to
conform
to
the
governing
constitutional
principles
set
down
in
the
meek
case.
the
pennsylvania
program
for
instructional
materials
and
equipment,
loan
these
materials
directly
to
the
sectarian
schools.
the
opinion
explains
that
the
teaching
process
in
these
schools
was
devoted
to
the
inculcation
of
religious
beliefs,
aid
to
the
educational
functions
of
these
institutions,
therefore
resulting
in
aid
to
the
religious
functions.
no
materials
or
equipment
are
loaned
to
sectarian
schools
in
ohio.
they
are
loaned
directly
to
the
student
or
his
parent.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
in
our
stipulation,
we
did
not
stipulate
the
materials
available
under
the
new
act
will
be
similar
to
those
under
the
old
act.
the
statutory
language
has
changed
little
bit.
the
statute
now
provides
that
the
loan
is
to
be
upon
the
individual
request
of
the
student
or
the
parent,
assuming
that
the
state
court
would
construed
that
broadly
enough
to
permit
a
wall
map.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
alright
your
honor.
i
believe
this
was
passed
for
the
educational
value
of
the
student
and
i
believe
the
educational
value
to
the
student
would
be
the
same
whether
he
is
using
a
map
with
other
students
in
a
group
or
whether
he
is
using
map
individually.
we
submit
that
the
most
important
educational
benefit,
the
text
books
comes
from
their
group
use
in
the
classroom
in
a
particular
course.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
i
do
not
believe
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
your
honor,
if
that
is
how
--
it
may
be
that
the
ohio
statute
as
interpreted
by
the
ohio
courts
would
not
permit
that,
what
would
happen
if
the
non-public
school
authorities
would
make
an
application
with
the
personnel
from
the
local
school
district.
the,
if
it
was
administratively
approved
there
and
formally
approved
by
the
board
of
education,
it
could
be
purchased
by
the
local
school
district,
then
when
there
was
the
need
for
it,
the
student
would
come
in
and
make
an
individual
request
for
a
loan.
if
it
had
been
purchased
and
was
in
the
inventory
and
was
otherwise
--
and
assuming
that
it
would
be
proper
under
ohio
laws
interpreted
by
the
state
courts,
that
would
be
the
loaned
then?
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
either
to
an
individual
student
or?
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
in
that
situation,
your
honor,
it
might
require
that
it
be
all
the
students
in
the
class.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
in
that
situation,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
your
honor,
where
that
map
would
be
stored
would
be
in
the
determination
of
the
department
of
education.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
well,
loan
could
cease
when
the
map
is
turned
back
to
the
local
public
school
personnel.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
assuming
that,
that
is
the
permitted
under
state
law,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
we
have
assumed
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
that
it
is
all
over
statute
is
different
and
the
statute
does
require
the
loan
be
based
upon
individual
request.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
your
honor,
in
that
situation,
i
believe
it
would
be
right,
it
would
be
every
student
would
be
the
loanee.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor;
we
believe
though
that
by
making
the
student
the
bailee
or
the
individual
student,
the
beneficiary,
we
have
some
of
the
constitutional
objections
in
meek.
if
in
meek,
the
educational
functions
and
the
sectarian
functions
of
the
sectarian
schools
are
so
inter-related,
no
way
could
be
given
to
the
educational
without
aiding
the
religious,
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
true
of
a
loan
to
the
child.
the
educational
or
special
educational
needs
of
the
school
child
are
different
and
distinct
from
the
religious
nation
of
the
sectarian
school
he
attend.
a
child
using
a
modern
educational
material
or
device
which
makes
learning
more
interesting,
will
receive
the
same
educational
benefits
from
that
material
whether
he
attends
a
sectarian
or
a
public
school
and
a
child
who
is
deficient
or
behind
in
one
or
more
subjects
has
the
same
educational
need
for
a
new
modern
educational
material
or
device
which
is
programmed
for
his
individual
study
and
learning.
as
we
read
the
nyquist
case,
which
the
plaintiffs
rely
on
to
show
that
since
it
could
not
be
loaned
to
the
school,
it
could
not
be
loaned
to
the
pupil,
we
believe
is
readily
distinguishable.
we
believe
that
financial
assistance
is
readily
distinguishable
from
forum
or
aid
in
the
form
secular
materials.
aid
in
the
form
of
the
secular
materials
would
go
to
the
child
and
remain
with
the
child.
unlike,
financial
assistance
it
would
not
flow
to
the
child,
through
the
school.
in
addition,
we
believe
the
reasoning
in
the
nyquist
case,
supports
the
validity
of
the
instructional
materials
and
equipments.
in
that
case,
the
opinion
contrasts
allen
and
harrison
by
saying
that
the
material
involved
were
secular
and
were
provided
in
common
to
all
students
in
the
state.
in
this
case,
no
material
which
is
even
capable
of
diversion
to
the
sectarian
use
may
be
loaned
and
no
materials
may
be
loaned
unless
they
are
available
to
the
public
school
students
within
the
district.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
i
assume
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
constitutionally,
i
don't
your
honor.
there
may
be
problems
whether
it
would
be
permissible
under
this
particular
statute,
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
the
opinion
in
meek
states
that
the
constitutional
objection
to
the
auxiliary
services
was
that
they
were
provided
in
a
sectarian
setting.
in
schools,
in
which
the
atmosphere
dedicated
to
religion
was
constantly
maintained.
in
ohio,
no
services
auxiliary
or
medial,
or
anything
which
has
anything
to
do
with
education
is
performed
in
a
sectarian
school.
they
are
performed
in
public
schools,
public
buildings
or
public
mobile
units
and
they
are
performed
by
public
personnel,
who
are
controlled
by
public
school
authorities.
we
therefore
submit
that
there
is
no
potential
in
this
situation
for
the
teacher
to
allow
the
religion
to
seep
in.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
i
believe
my
colleague
will.
