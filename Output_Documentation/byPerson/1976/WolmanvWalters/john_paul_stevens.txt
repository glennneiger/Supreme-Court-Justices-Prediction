mr.
young,
in
your
point
about
no
direct
contact
between
the
school
board
and
the
religious
institution
and
the
loan
being
to
the
child,
is
it
not
correct
that
all
the
paper
work
and
processing
and
the
contact
is
between
the
school
and
the
school
board,
they
handle
these
loans
on
a
collective
basis
and
there
is
no
direct
contact
with
the
pupil
and
the
school
board.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
not
in
the
text
books,
it
is
there
in
the
statute.
justice

paul
stevens
where
does
the

get
it,

his
own
school
or
at

justice

ths
is
the
same
thing

or
the
reading
improvement
equipment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
the
premises
of
the
private

justice
john
paul
stevens
this
person
be
in
the
nature
of
a
permanent
employee,
regularly
stationed
at
the
private
school?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
it
is
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
this
something
like
the
school

that
moves
around
if
they
do
not
need
a
school
nurse
five
days
a
week?
