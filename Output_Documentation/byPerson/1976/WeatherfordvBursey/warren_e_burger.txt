chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
1510,
weatherford
against
bursey.
mr.
coleman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
interrupt
you
in
just
a
moment,
mr.
coleman,
if
i
may.
i
take
it
you’re
going
to
devote
some
time
to
telling
us,
or
suggesting
that
even
assuming
that
there
were
constitutional
or
other
violations
which
would’ve
led
to
--supported
a
reversal
of
the
conviction,
there
is
no
basis
for
a
civil
action
for
damages?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’re
going
to
get
to
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
coleman,
i
come
back
to
my
apparent
point.
you’ve
used
22
of
your
30
minutes
and
you
haven’t
got
to
the
question
of
whether
assuming
all
these
things,
there
is
a
damage
action
available?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
going
back
to
mr.
bursey’s
situation,
were
all
of
these
claims
which
are
made
as
a
basis
for
the
1983
damage
claim
available
as
challenges
to
the
validity
of
his
conviction
originally?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
bursey
was
convicted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
took
no
appeal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
was
a
fugitive?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
take
it,
to
your
position
or
the
state’s
position
is
that
the
only
remedy
that
mr.
bursey
had
was
to
take
an
appeal
under
and
then
perhaps
if
he
got
his
conviction
reversed
upon
these
grounds
then
he
might
conceivably
have
a
different
course
of
action
from
the
one
the
fourth
circuit
is
now
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
coleman.
mr.
frey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
at
page
49
on
your
brief,
which
is
near
the
end
as
you
are
near
the
end
of
your
time
of
argument,
you’ve
said
that
weatherford’s
testimony
at
trial
is
not
an
appropriate
source
of
civil
liability.
are
you
going
to
discuss
that
subject?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
state
did
not
seem
to
be
much
interested?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
take
measures,
you
mean
take
an
appeal
from
his
conviction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
kind
of
a
violation
are
you
addressing
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
a
constitutional
violation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mcdonald.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
was
this
offer
of
protection
given,
after
he
testified
or
before?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
is
it,
after
or
before?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how,
in
your
view,
did
the
testimony
of
weatherford,
testimony
now,
not
anything
that
preceded
it
cause
a
damage,
an
actionable
damage
to
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
what
did
he
testify,
weatherford?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
was
an
eyewitness
of
the
event,
was
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
did
he
testify
to
any
facts
which
he
learned
after
the
events
based
in
the
indictment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
made
him
an
eyewitness,
didn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean,
that
would
be
admissible?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
that
weatherford
had
never
attended
any
meeting
at
which
bursey’s
attorney
was
present,
and
then
nevertheless
testified
as
he
did
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
be
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
wouldn’t
have
to
look
at
any
of
them
now,
would
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
would’ve
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
would’ve
been
no
less
surprised,
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
being
the
eyewitness
testimony
of
the
fugitive
presumed
accomplice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
resume
there
at
1
o’clock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
white.
