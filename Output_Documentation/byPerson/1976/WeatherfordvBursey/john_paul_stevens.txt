justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mcdonald,
i
have
a
little
trouble
with
the
surprise
theory
because
what
difference
would’ve
been
made
if
you
know
10
days
in
advance
he’s
going
to
testify?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
couldn’t
he
made
that
decision
whether
to
claim
entrapment
at
the
close
of
the
prosecution’s
case?
he
didn’t
have
to
get
on
with
the
stand
first,
and
the
defendant
had
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
there’s
another
thought
that
runs
to
my
mind.
you
mean
you’d
have
to
--
the
defendant
would
not
know
whether
or
not
he
was
entrapped
until
he
heard
the
prosecution’s
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
get
to
that,
could
you
just
tell
me
again
exactly
what
the
constitutional
violation
is
assuming
that
the
trial
is
unimpaired
by
what
happened?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
is
it
critical
to
your
theory
that
there
was
some
use
made
of
the
prosecution
of
the
defense
strategy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
assuming
that,
does
that
all
then
depend
on
having
some
impact
on
the
trial
process,
(inaudible)
misrepresented
if
it
didn’t
affect
the
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
--
well,
go
ahead.
excuse
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
the
--
he
denied
access
to
counsel
before
trial.
what
was
denied
here
before
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there’s
no
interference
with
access
between
the
client
and
the
lawyer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
the
defense
asked
him
to
sit
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
i
understand
all
that,
but
the
right
is
that
they
have
a
right,
an
absolute
right
not
to
have
an
informant
who
is
concealing
his
identity
present
while
the
lawyer
and
the
client
are
together.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
it
untrue
at
the
time
he
made
the
statement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mcdonald,
one
thing
paused
me.
what
was
the
defense
strategy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
just
wonder
if
you
could
sum
it
up
in
a
word.
was
the
strategy
to
deny
the
incident
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
police
entrapment
or
just
of
an
inadequate
proof
or
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
what
was
revealed
to
the
prosecution
then
was
that
the
defense
hoped
that
the
government
couldn’t
prove
its
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mcdonald,
let
me
just
interrupt
once
more,
if
i
may.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
authority
or
the
closest
authority
for
the
proposition
that
there’s
some
kind
of
protection,
either
constitution
or
otherwise
for
a
“defense
strategy
session”
other
than
a
session
which
only
the
attorney
and
the
client
were
present.
i
mean,
we
don’t
have
normal
privilege
situation
but
where
is
the
source
for
this
notion
of
a
broad
grouping
that’s
also
protected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
when
the
third
person
present
between
the
defendant
and
the
attorney
as
well?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
those
were
the
intrusions
on
the
privacy
of
the
attorney
and
the
client.
i
was
just
talking
about
intrusions
on
the
non-privacy
of
the
attorney,
the
client
and
the
third
party.
are
there
any
such
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it’s
easy
to
understand
what
you’re
talking
about
when
you
got
an
attorney
and
a
client
in
a
normally
privileged
situation
and
there’s
an
intrusion
on
that
relationship.
i’m
asking
you
what
cases
are
that
had
involved
a
three-party
situation;
an
attorney,
a
client,
and
a
third
party
and
then
someone
else
intrudes.
what
is
the
source
of
your
notion
that
that
relationship
is
protected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i’m
not
asking
about
the
theory
of
the
other
cases
that
established
this
general
notion
that’s
what
i’m
trying
to
--
