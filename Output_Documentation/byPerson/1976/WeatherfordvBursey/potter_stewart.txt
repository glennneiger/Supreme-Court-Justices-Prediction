justice
potter
stewart
the
state
solicitor
that
was
here,
a
county
or
state
official?
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
the
prosecutor
though?
justice
potter
stewart
more
like
of
a
county
prosecutor
or
district
attorney
except
his
jurisdiction
was
two
counties?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
want
to
be
sure
about
i
understood
what
his
office
was.
justice
potter
stewart
and
bursey
is
now
out
on
--
released
on
bond,
pending
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
an
appeal
bond?
justice
potter
stewart
pending
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
--
before
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
and
weatherford
also
purportedly
out
on
bond
or
--?
justice
potter
stewart
the
only
technical
difference
as
i
remember
was
that
the
court
as
such
set
aside
the
convictions
and
mr.
justice
harlan
and
i
would
not
have
done
so,
and
would’ve
allowed
the
trial
judge
to
make
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
there
was
any
taint
and
allow
him
in
his
discretion
to
set
aside
the
convictions
if
he
found
that
there
was
taint,
but
i
think
you’re
right
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
any
event
--
at
most
that
was
even
what
the
court
did
was
for
a
set
aside
of
the
convictions
and
then
for
a
determination
of
how
much
if
any
taint
there
had
been
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel?
justice
potter
stewart
for
any
per
se
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
because
it
had
been
conceded
that
there
had
been
electronic
surveillance
in
the
one
case,
did
both
cases
involve
electronic
surveillance?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
other
was
electronic
surveillance
in
one
of
the
washington
dc
hotels.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
cited
at
the
district
court
level
and
not
on
the
papers,
not
on
a
motion,
but
after
the
trial,
wasn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
judgment
was
for
the
defendants?
justice
potter
stewart
although
that
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
there
has
been
no
assessment
of
damages
or
anything
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
he
did
come
back
and
serve
his
sentence?
justice
potter
stewart
he
did
not
appeal
as
the
chief
justice
suggested?
justice
potter
stewart
might,
but
you
said
it
was?
justice
potter
stewart
including
the
facts
or
those
basic
facts
you
just
stated?
justice
potter
stewart
those
were
accepted?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
had
he
maintained
his
cover?
justice
potter
stewart
he
did
not
maintain
--
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
just
ask
you
this
just
before
you
leave
that,
i
think
i
read
in
the
briefs
that
he,
ultimately
at
the
trial
he
pretty
well
admitted
his
implication,
that
is
bursey
did?
justice
potter
stewart
he
did
not
plead
guilty,
did
he?
justice
potter
stewart
but
did
concede
his
participation
in
the
(voice
overlap)
episode?
justice
potter
stewart
he
didn’t
testify
falsely,
did
he?
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
at
the
time
of
the
trial
cross-examination
of
weatherford
as
to
these
two
meetings
with
counsel?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
just,
he
was
met
by
the
much
stronger
case
of
the
prosecution
that
he
hadn’t
anticipated,
because
he
had
not
anticipated
that
an
eyewitness
would
testify
and
one
did
and
that’s
always
somewhat
of
a
shock
to
defense
counsel?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
there’s
a
very
strong
case
against
the
defendant
he
sometimes
feels
impelled
to
take
the
stand
where
he
wouldn’t
otherwise?
