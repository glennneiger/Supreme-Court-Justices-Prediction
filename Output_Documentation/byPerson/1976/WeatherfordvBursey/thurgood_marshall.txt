justice
thurgood
marshall
what’s
the
governmental
interest
here
in
having
this
man
sit
down
at
the
conference
between
lawyer
and
client?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
do
you
defend
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that’s
sufficient
to
override
a
federal
constitutional
interest?
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn’t
they
have
said
that
you
may
maintain
your
cover,
and
just
pick
a
fight
with
him
and
say
you
don’t
want
to
talk
to
him
anymore?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
right.
he
didn’t
have
to
sit
down
twice,
not
once,
twice?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
like
putting
a
spy
camera
in
the
wall
of
the
garden
hotel
was
necessary
on
the
black
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
not
the
only
agent
that
they
have
in
the
south
carolina,
isn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
long
had
he
been
an
agent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don’t
think
as
some
others
could’ve
done
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
rather
than
to
sit
to
and
do
what
you
say,
you
admit
that
it
was
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it’s
not
wrong
for
the
government
to
have
a
government
agent
sitting
down
at
the
conference
between
a
lawyer
and
a
client?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
let’s
say
is
it
immoral?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
dirty
cool?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
good?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
so
much
difficulty
with
this
need
to
maintain
cover
which
was
gotten
rid
of?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
always
leads
to
cover
until
they
got
this
information
and
then
after
that,
they
didn’t
need
to
go
there
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
facts
are
that
one,
they
wanted
to
keep
the
cover.
two,
because
they
wanted
to
keep
the
cover,
he
sat
down
in
the
meeting
between
bursey
and
the
lawyer.
three,
that
when
he
got
the
time
of
trial,
they
decided
they
didn’t
need
to
cover,
those
are
the
facts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
didn’t
testify
as
eyewitness,
testified
as
fellow
participant,
didn’t?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
want
a
pro
se
rule
that
every
stool
pigeon’s
testimony
must
be
revealed
before
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
the
affirmative
other
than
hiring
his
man?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
didn’t
set
up
either
one
of
these
meetings,
did
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
came
after
him,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
chief
strom
said
that
he
knew
nothing
about
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
said
that
if
he
knew
about
it,
he
would
have
stopped.
i
got
that
in
your
brief,
didn’t
i?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
specifically
denied
ever
knowing
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
evidence
do
you
have
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
chief
was
not
telling
the
truth
on
the
statement
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
two
conferences
with
the
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean,
you
can
assume
that
it
--
is
there
any
testimony
from
weatherford
that
he
talked
to
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
about
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
got
two
people
who
deny
it.
now,
what
do
you
still
have
that
says
it
did
happen?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
so.
