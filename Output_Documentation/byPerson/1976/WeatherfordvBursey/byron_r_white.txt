justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
still
proceedings
to
go
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
respect
to
qualified
to
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
so,
that
an
immunity
claim,
a
good
faith
immunity
claim
is
still
open
to
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
frey,
what
if
the
government
had
asked
the
agent
on
the
stand
to
testify
as
to
what
happened
at
the
meetings
between
the
defendants
and
his
lawyer
and
that
the
question
was
and
the
information
he
wanted
was
clearly
relevant
to
guilt?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
it’s
inadmissible
and
it
has
to
be
and
it
would
be
inadmissible
because
of
some
constitutional
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
did
the
constitutional
violation
occur?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
the
evidence
is
offered
or
when
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
violation
is
rooted
in
sitting
in
the
defense
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
your
fundamental
position
in
this
case,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that’s
one
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
the
end
of
the
case,
if
you’re
right,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
frey,
unless
the
violation
occurred
at
the
time
of
the
meeting,
why
would
the
agent
ever
be
liable
for
what
happened
at
trial?
he
was
called
by
the
prosecution.
justice
byron
r.
white
he’s
called
by
the
prosecution
and
he’s
under
an
obligation
to
testify.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless,
there’s
a
violation
at
the
time
of
the
meeting.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
mcdonald,
would
you
have
stated
that
1983
cause
of
action
if
bursey
had
pleaded
guilty?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
if
suppose
bursey
had
been
charged
or
indicted
and
then
before
trial
the
case
had
been
dismissed
because
the
prosecution
didn’t
think
it
could
win?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
theory
is
that
the
constitutional
violation
was
complete
and
at
the
time
of
the
participation
in
the
meetings
and
at
the
trial
just
to
put
a
question
of
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
specific
claim
of
the
constitutional
violation
by
sitting
it
on
the
meetings?
is
it
trial
strategy,
learning
trial
strategy,
or
is
it
learning
confidential,
or
sitting
on
a
confidential
communications
between
the
attorney
and
the
client?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
it
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
doesn’t
make
a
little
bit
of
a
difference
what
you’re
claiming
as
to
whether
the
violation
occurs
at
the
trial
or
when
you’re
sitting
down
on
a
meeting?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
not
at
all.
not
at
all.
i’m
just
wondering
what
the
constitutional
violation
is
and
when
it
occurs.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
about
the
time
he
was
sitting
in,
they
were
also
planning
another
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
there
be
a
constitutional
violation
at
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
will
suggest
there
wasn’t
any
violation
there
of
a
third
party,
a
government
agent
sitting
in
on
those
kinds
of
conversations?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
under
your
position
there
would’ve
been
a
1983
violation
in
the
hoffa
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
would
be
a
constitutional
violation,
you’d
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
the
federal
government
is
and
that
if
that’s
a
violation
of
a
sixth
amendment,
there
might
be
a
bivens
type
of
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
theory
seems
to
reach
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
the
hoffa
case
that
at
the
time
the
agent
was
sitting
in
on
conversations
between
lawyer
and
client,
there
was
a
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way.
suppose
there
were
two
people
sitting
in
on
a
defense
at
these
same
meetings.
one
was
the
government
agent
and
the
other
one
was
not
a
government
agent
at
the
time
and
never
was
a
government
agent
except
that
the
government
heard
that
he
was
sitting
in
and
he
agreed
to
testify
and
he
offered
his
testimony
at
the
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright
and
then
you
don’t
think
that
the
information
--
that
the
testimony
of
that
non-agent
would
be
excludable?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
postulate
all
you
want,
there
is
no
connection
of
the
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
they
call
the
agent
at
the
same
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
testify
the
identical
things?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
the
question
is,
was
it
a
confidential
meeting
or
wasn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
was
it
something
that
they
could
expect
to
be
private
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
say,
you
had
two
extra
people
in
the
meeting
besides
the
client
and
lawyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
weatherford
against
bursey
is
the
other
case
that
i
have.
it
comes
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
it
involves
the
question
of
whether
the
constitutional
rights
of
--
of
the
defendant,
bursey
in
a
state
criminal
jury
trial
were
violated
by
the
post
arrest
but
pretrial
activities
of
an
undercover
agent
of
the
state
--
of
a
state
investigative
agency.
the
undercover
agent
testified
at
the
trial.
the
state
courts
upheld
the
conviction
and
bursey
was
--
served
his
--
served
his
sentence.
he
then
began
this
--
he
then
began
a
1983
action
in
the
federal
district
court.
the
federal
district
court
held
against
him
in
all
respects
but
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
undercover
agent's
activities
had
invaded
bursey's
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights
to
counsel.
disagreeing
with
the
court
of
appeals,
we
reversed
and
our
reasons
are
given
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
