mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
concur
in
mr.
coleman’s
observation
and
i
agree
that
the
district
court
made
no
direct
finding
that
there
was
a
need
for
cover
in
this
case
and
i
think
that
a
review
of
the
record
will
conclude
independently
that
as
a
factual
matter,
there
was
no
need
for
cover
and
strom
himself
testified
on
several
occasions
during
the
federal
trial
precisely
to
that
effect.
the
district
court
judge
at
one
point
asked
chief
strom
whether
or
not
there
was
anything
that
weatherford
was
working
on
that
would
require
the
maintenance
of
his
cover
following
bursey’s
arrest
and
strom
said
that
there
was
nothing
that
he
was
working
on.
and
strom
in
response
to
questions
from
counsel
on
cross-examination
stated
that,
furthermore,
he
was
fundamentally
unconcern
about
his
agent’s
cover
being
blown.
and
the
reason
he
was
unconcerned
was
that
he
doubted
whether
weatherford
could
be
effective
after
the
arrest
of
any
of
them.
there
is
also
a
suggestion
in
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
that
there
was
some
concern
about
the
agent’s
life
or
that
he
might
be
done
physical
injury,
weatherford
certainly
never
indicated
that
he
was
in
fear
for
his
life
or
that
that
was
the
reason
his
cover
was
being
maintained.
in
point
of
the
fact,
strom
offered
him
protection
and
weatherford
declined
the
offer
and
moreover,
had
weatherford’s
position
as
a
law
enforcement
agent
been
truly
compromised,
then
he
never
would’ve
been
offered
the
job
by
strom
and
never
would’ve
considered
that
he
himself
could’ve
accepted
such
a
job
and
still
been
an
effective
law
enforcement
agent.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
i
believe
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
i
think
it
was
after
he
testified,
strom
offered
him
a
job
of
so-called
“above
the
ground”
kind
of
agent,
to
use
weatherford’s
phrase,
and
he
declined.
he
decided
to
pursue
graduate
studies
instead.
but
weatherford
himself
said
that
he
felt
in
time,
he
could
be
effective
as
an
agent
in
almost
any
other
capacity.
but
strom’s
testimony
was
quite
explicit.
there
was
nothing
that
weatherford
was
working
on.
i
think
the
argument
really
is
one
of
the
generalized
convenience
rather
than
any
demonstrated
need
and
of
course,
the
district
court
made
no
specific
finding
in
that
regard.
not
only
does
the
record
not
substantiate
that
there
was
any
need,
but
the
record
really
doesn’t
show
that
weatherford
did
anything
other
than
what
he
did
in
this
case,
it
could
be
concede
of
as
a
benefit
to
law
enforcement.
there
was,
for
example,
evidence
in
the
record
that
he
participated
in
vandalism
at
the
administration
building
of
the
university
of
south
carolina.
that
he
went
to
atlanta,
georgia.
i
can’t
conceive
why
his
state
law
enforcement
duties
would
take
him
there
but
nonetheless,
he
went
there
to
interview
about
going
to
cuba
“to
check
up
on
radicals,”
to
use
his
phrase,
but
he
never
made
a
single
arrest
as
a
sled
agent.
he
testified
in
only
one
trial
and
that
was
mr.
bursey’s
trial
and
he
could
not
remember
a
single
assignment
which
he
had
been
given
which
led
to
a
conviction
other
than
bursey’s.
so,
i
think
that
to
the
extent
that
an
argument
of
law
enforcement
need
has
made
here
completely
collapses.
but
even
if
there
was
a
need
for
cover,
i
think
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
clearly
indicate
that
that
state
interest
can
never
be
exerted
over
a
defendant’s
right
to
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
and
fair
trial.
one
of
the
reasons
that
is
true
is
because
there
are
other
less
intrusive
ways
for
a
state
to
protect
its
legitimate
interest
in
secrecy,
if
in
fact,
it
had
one.
one
way,
as
this
court
knows
would
be
simply
to
forgo
prosecution,
but
strom
himself
suggested
another
way
in
which
this
problem
could
be
solved
and
that
is
he
simply
would’ve
taken
his
agent
off
the
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
strom
himself
conceded
that
what
had
happened
in
this
case
was
in
his
judgment
a
violation
of
the
constitution
and
he
also
said
that
it
was
unethical.
of
course,
he
said
that
he
didn’t
know
that
intrusion
was
taking
place.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,
your
honor,
the
gist
of
our
complaint
is
that
there
was
an
interference
with
the
right
to
counsel
prior
to
trial
and
that
there
was
a
creation
of
surprise
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
he
testified
about
what
was
done
at
the
selective
service
board
itself.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
that’s
right,
sir.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
the
answer
is
no.
he
didn’t
reveal
any
attorney-client
confidences
during
the
trial
of
the
case.
i
think
the
record
doesn’t
reflect
that.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
we
don’t
attack
his
testimony
in
this
civil
suit,
your
honor.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
that’s
right.
oh,
he
was
a
participant.
yes,
sir.
there’s
no
question
about
that
and
he
also
participated
on
the
planning
of
it
as
well.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
he
was
both.
both
your
honor.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
i
think,
one
of
the
difference
is
--
well,
for
example
he
might
have
had
a
defense
based
on
entrapment
had
he
known
that
weatherford
was
an
agent.
as
you
recall,
there
was
direct
testimony
from
the
solicitor
as
well
as
from
weatherford
himself,
not
only
that
weatherford
was
an
agent,
but
mr.
merrick
also
was
an
undercover
agent.
solicitor
ford,
for
example,
said
that
there
was
another
agent
and
there
was
so
many
of
them
that
he
didn’t
know
who
was
working
for
whom,
but
there
was
an
agent
who
was
unavailable
to
testify
and
was
out
of
the
country.
and
there
was
other
testimony
indicating
that
that
person
was
mr.
merrick.
so,
we
have
a
situation
where
there
really
were
two
agents
involved.
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,
your
honor,
that’s
of
course
part
of,
it
seems
to
me
part
of
advice
in
allowing
the
state
to
try
a
case
basically
by
ambush.
i
don’t
think
that’s
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
i
think
that
he
wouldn’t
know
that
defense
was
available,
your
honor.
if
he
didn’t
know
the
law
enforcement
agents
were
his
conspirators
or
the
persons
who
participated
with
him.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
your
honor,
we
argue
that
a
per
se
rule
would
be
applicable
in
this
case,
but
it’s
possible
for
this
court
to
affirm
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
without
reaching
such
a
result
because
i
think
there
clearly
was
constitutional
prejudice
here
in
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
there
was
deliberate
intrusion.
this
was
not
a
case
of
passive
intrusion
into
defense
counsel,
but
this
involves
affirmative
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
state.
we
also,
i
think
can
demonstrate
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
no,
he
did
not
your
honor
but
he
made
contact
with
them.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
the
meetings
were,
your
honor,
set
up
by
mr.
bursey
and
it
is
true
that
mr.
weatherford
was
asked
to
join
those
meetings,
but
i
think
that
we
must
understand
that
weatherford
was
hired
by
strom
and
his
specific
instructions
were
to
infiltrate
certain
groups
at
the
university
and
to
establish
contact
with
certain
people
and
one
of
the
people
who
was
specifically
mentioned,
specifically
talked
about
by
the
chief
was
bursey.
now,
he
said
that
he
didn’t
point
him
out
but
he
did
say
that
he
did
discuss
bursey
with
weatherford
and
he
assumed
that
he
would
be
one
of
the
persons
that
mr.
weatherford
would
investigate.
now,--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
he
said
that
he
didn’t
know
that
the
actual
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
that’s
correct
sir.
he
denied
that
he
had
any
direct
knowledge
that
agent
was
sitting
in
on
the
discussions,
but
it’s
our
position
that
in
the
action
for
1983
that
all
we
must
establish
is
whether
that
he
must
be
held
to
a
standard
of
accepting
the
reasonable
consequences
of
the
things
that
he
directed.
after
the
arrest,
his
instructions
remain
the
same
to
weatherford
and
that
is
that
he
continue
his
investigation
of
people
at
the
university
and
more
importantly
than
that,
the
chief
knew
that
weatherford
was
still
continuing
to
investigate
bursey
specifically.
so
he
knew
that
his
agent
was
doing
the
very
same
things
after
the
arrest
as
he
did
before
the
arrest
and
in
point
of
fact,
he
continued
that
instructions.
so,
the
chief
knew
that
weatherford
was
investigating
bursey.
the
chief
also
knew
that
an
attorney
had
been
appointed
--
a
sham
attorney
had
been
appointed
to
represent
weatherford
and
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
that
ruse
was
to
have
somebody
with
whom
bursey’s
attorney
could
talk.
and
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
he
did
specifically
deny
that
and
we
of
course
--
and
if
our
standard
of
proof,
your
honor
is
that
we
must
prove
that
he
even
knew
or
that
prosecutor
was
told
by
weatherford,
the
we
lose
because
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
your
honor,
there
are
a
lot
of
things
we
can
look
at
in
the
record
to
suggest
whether
or
not
the
chief’s
memory
was
actually
faithful.
there
was
continuous
contact
between
weatherford
and
the
chief
following
the
arrest.
every
other
week,
weatherford
would
go
to
the
sled
office
in
columbia
and
pick
up
his
paycheck.
he
picked
it
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
talk
to
the
chief,
your
honor?
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
he
denied
that
he
talked
to
the
chief
specifically
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
your
honor,
i
can
actually
concede
that
if
we
must
prove
that,
we
lose
because
we
can’t.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
and
i
think
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
your
honor,
without
a
doubt
that
that’s
the
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
i
think
under
those
circumstances,
he
would
be
entitled
to
recover
for
the
constitutional
violation
which
had
occurred
in
the
same
way
that
the
bursey
was
a
victim
of
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure
even
if
there’s
no
trial,
he
could
bring
an
action
under
1983.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
i
think
that
it
does
go
to
a
question
of
damages.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
that
may
be
true
but
the
right
to
counsel
has
been
recognized
as
existing
prior
to
a
trial.
so
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
which
there
was
here,
that’s
right,
sir.
now,
i
think,
the
more
difficult
question,
if
i
understand,
your
honor,
is
the
whole
question
of
res
judicata
and
collateral
estoppel.
let
me
say
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,
the
constitutional
violation
here
was
an
intrusion
into
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
that
was
a
deliberate
intrusion
on
the
capture
of
the
entire
defense
strategy.
it
was
captured
by
someone
who
was
an
agent
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
we
don’t
think
we
have
to
show
that,
but
we
think
that
there
was
prejudice
from
the
conduct
of
the
government
here.
what
the
government
did
was
it
misrepresented
this
case.
it
misrepresented
who
the
witnesses
are
going
to
be.
so,
that
it
made
it
impossible
for
the
defendant
to
prepare
for
the
case
which
is
actually
thrown
upon
it.
it’s
not
a
situation
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,
in
via
versus
cliff
is
an
instance
where
the
court
found
that
even
though
there
was
no
prejudice
and
no
impact
upon
trial,
that
a
defendant
who
would
been
denied
a
constitutional
right
would
still
be
able
to
maintain
an
action
on
the
1983.
in
that
case,
the
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
--
that
the
prisoner
was
incarcerated
and
he
was
denied
access
to
his
attorney
on
two
occasions.
so
after
the
second
occasion,
that
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
there
was
a
recess,
so
that
as
far
as
the
trial
is
concerned,
there
was
a
curing
of
that
defect,
but
the
court
said
that
nonetheless,
he
still
have
an
action
for
damages
for
denial
of
the
right
to
counsel
and
an
action
under
section
1983.
so,
i
think
that
would
be
an
instance
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,
the
right
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
we
think
that
you
have
a
right
not
to
have
an
agent
for
prosecution
sit
in
on
the
defense
planning
sessions
as
the
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
really
is
a
question
of
semantics
more
than
substance
because
he
was
there
in
his
role
as
an
undercover
agent.
his
specific
assignment
was
to
infiltrate
the
university
and
more
importantly
and
more
specifically,
his
assignment
was
to
get
information
about
bursey
and
he
was
there
because
that
was
his
assignment
and
even
after
the
arrest,
the
chief
knew
that
he
was
continuing
to
investigate
bursey
and
he
continued
his
instruction,
so
he
was
there
because
he’s
an
agent
and
in
point
of
fact,
that
was
his
testimony
at
the
state
court
trial.
he
had
long
hair
as
informers
do
and
he
was
dressed
in
a
hippie
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,
i
don’t
think
the
court
has
to
adopt
the
per
se
rule
for
bursey
to
be
entitled
to
relief
for
at
least
two
reasons.
number
one,
there
was
affirmative
misconduct
here
that
rule
arguably
might
be
different
if
the
conduct
was
truly
passive.
what
we
have
involved
here
is
deliberate
course
of
activity
on
the
prosecution
which
i
think
the
court
has
to
be
sensitive
because
of
special
role
of
the
prosecution
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,
the
district
court
recited
the
facts,
but
concluded
that
there
was
no
constitutional
violation.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
a
deliberate
intrusion
and
i
think
there
clearly
was
and
there
also
was
that
there
was
a
manufacturing
of
surprise.
i
just
don’t
think
that
the
prosecutor
can
be
allowed
under
such
cases
as
blackledge
versus
perry
and
other
cases
the
district
court
talks
about,
the
prosecutor
having
an
interest
to
serve
the
courts
of
justice.
i
don’
think
that
it’s
tolerable
to
have
him
go
to
a
defendant
and
say,
“this
is
the
kind
of
case
which
is
going
to
be
presented
to
you.”
these
things
were
voluntarily.
weatherford
himself
stated
and
it
was
the
lies,
what
it
was,
the
deception,
he
said
that
he
was
not
going
to
testify.
he
said
he
was
not
going
to
be
at
the
trial.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
he
was.
he
knew
from
the
very
beginning,
your
honor
that
he
would
be
a
witness
and
his
testimony
was
un-contradicted
in
that
regard.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
i
think,
your
honor,
that
it
is
true
that
the
final
decision
to
use
weatherford
as
a
witness
might
have
been
made
at
the
day
of
trial.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
he
knew,
he
said,
that
it
was
always
a
possibility
that
he
would
be
a
witness.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
i
think,
your
honor,
that
he
knew
that
that
was
a
possibility.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
this
is
what
i’m
saying.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
your
honor,
i’m
not
trying
to
say
anything
that’s
inconsistent
with
that.
i
agree
that
the
final
decision
to
use
him
was
made
at
the
day
of
trial,
but
all
the
parties
knew
that
it
was
a
possibility
that
he
would
be
a
witness.
weatherford
testified
to
that
effect
and
so
did
strom.
strom
said
that
in
all,
you
have
so
called
big
cases
where
you
use
an
undercover
agent,
it’s
simply
implicit
that
that
person
at
some
point
may
very
well
be
a
witness
and
strom
said,
“there’s
no
big
deal,
you
let
him
testify,
the
cover
is
blown
then
you
give
him
a
job
as
another
agent.”
so,
i
think
that
it’s
not
correct
to
say
that
it
was
not
implied
in
the
whole
--
(voice

mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
but
your
honor,
if
i
said
that
i
misspoke
myself.
what
i
mean
to
say,
is
that
he
knew
that
it
was
a
possibility.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,
the
court
of
appeals
of
course,
found
that
weatherford
did
have
knowledge
of
the
defense
tactics
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
there
is
not,
your
honor.
i
use
the
phrase
prosecution
because
the
district
court
found
that
weatherford
was
an
agent
of
the
prosecution
and
it
assumed
that
when
i
use
the
phrase
“prosecution,”
it
presupposes
that
we
assume
as
did
the
court
of
appeals
that
weatherford
is
to
be
regarded
for
purposes
of
finding
a
constitutional
violation
as
a
member
of
the
prosecution.
as
i
say,
if
we
must
prove
that
the
prosecutor
knew
about
what
happened
in
defense
counsel
then
we
lose
because
we
can’t,
because
we
depend,
in
order
to
establish
that
kind
of
proof
of
what
amounts
to
a
confession
of
wrongdoing
from
the
parties
that
we
are
suing
and
i
think
realistically
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,
your
honor,
they
knew
that
there
were
three
people
who
actually
participated
in
the
incident
at
the
draft
board,
merrick
and
bursey
and
weatherford.
weatherford
had
already
ruled
himself
out.
he
was
not
going
to
testify.
as
you
recall,
he
said
that
his
benefactor
dr.
hartwig
had
insisted
that
he
talk
to
the
police
that
he’d
gone
down
the
hilton
had
that
he
had
talked
with
them
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
i
am
sorry.
reasonable
doubt,
your
honor.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
inadequate
proof
and
reasonable
doubt,
that
there
was
no
eyewitness.
merrick
was
out
of
town.
weatherford
was
out
of
the
country.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
yes,
your
honor.
that’s
what
[laughter
attempt]
they
were
going
with
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
very
limited
cross-examination,
your
honor.
i
think
that
mr.
wise
alluded
to
the
fact
that
he
had
established
contact
with
various
people
and
he
had
a
lot
of
friends
in
the
movement.
but
i
don’t
believe
there
was
any
direct
examination
about
the
attorney-client
meetings.
in
fact
my
recollection
is
that
there
was
not.
and
point
of
fact,
i
think
if
you
read
the
state
transcript,
you
will
see
how
in
effect
did
counsel
was
rendered
by
the
surprise
and
he
himself
testified
that
it
totally
changed
the
case
and
he
felt
that
his
ability
to
function
as
attorney
was
completely
impaired.
i
think
one
can
appreciate
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
it
changed
other
things
too,
your
honor.
they
determined
that
mr.
bursey
would
have
to
take
a
stand.
he
had
--
they
had
ruled
that
average
type
of
cases
(voice
overlap).
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
i
think
had
he
known
about
that
in
advance
what
the
preparation
and
it
is
a
benefit
and
had
he
known
about
that
prior
to
the
trial,
he
might
have
been
more
effective.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
vices
inherent
in
sitting
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,
here
it’s
learning
defense
strategy,
that
would
be
when
weatherford
already
knew
the
incriminating
evidence,
but
that
could
be
involved
or
people
might
be
concerned
about
evidence
of
other
crimes
or
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
it’s
getting
around
again
to
the
question
of
res
judicata
and
collateral
estoppel.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,
there
are
different
kinds
of
harm
that
could
result
the
harm
here
which
is
twofold.
it
was
that
the
defense
strategy
was
captured
and
it
could’ve
been
that
it
was
relate
to
at
least
a
member
of
the
prosecution.
we
did
not
prove
that
that
defense
strategy
had
actually
been
related
to
the
prosecution.
but
it’s
clear
that
knowledge
of
an
opponent’s
tactics
give
a
person
quite
an
advantage
on
an
adversary
situation.
that’s
one
of
the
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
i
think
that
would
be
different,
your
honor.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
i
don’t
know
that
the
right
to
plan
a
crime
is
constitutionally
protected
in
the
sense
that
the
right
to
plan
a
defense
is
constitutionally
protected.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,
it
shows
roughly
now
the
situation
that
was
involved
in
the
hoffa
case.
the
court
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,
of
course
that
involve
the
united
states
government
there
but
the
court
didn’t
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
the
court
didn’t
rule.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
had
the
state
been
the
prosecuting
party
that
may
well
have
been
that
mr.
hoffa
could
have
an
action
on
the
1983
for
what
happened
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
we
certainly
don't
rule
about
that
possibility,
your
honor.
perhaps,
there
could
have
been.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
right,
sir.
if
there
would
be
a
violation
for
the
intrusion
that
occurred
at
the
case
at
which
it
occurred
rather
than
a
case
or
prosecution,
which
would
grow
out
of
the
criminal
activity,
was
might
have
been
discussed.
i
think
hoffa
involves
that
the
duality
of
situation.
it
clearly
suggests
that
had
hoffa
been
convicted
that
is
test
to
the
trial
that
he
would’ve
had
grounds
to
set
aside
that
conviction
on
the
grounds
of
intrusion
and
i
assume
that
he
would
also
have
a
1983
action.
the
solicitor
general
has
raised
an
issue
involving
the
general
use
of
informers
and
has
suggested
that
if
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
to
be
affirmed
in
this
case
then
it
would
provide
a
so-called
“fail
safe
method”
for
detecting
informants.
we
responded
to
that
in
our
brief
but
let
me
simply
add
to
that
or
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
a
testimony
by
strom.
he
indicated
that
the
ruling
of
the
fourth
circuit
or
he
testified
that
the
present
practice
in
south
carolina
was
not
to
allow
undercover
agents
to
participate
in
defense
strategy
sessions.
he
claimed
that
it
happened
in
this
case
because
he
was
ignorant
of
it
but
he
was
quite
pointed
in
his
testimony
that
he
simply
would
not
permit
one
of
his
agents
to
participate
in
defense
consultations
and
he
didn’t
qualify
his
remark
in
the
way
that
such
instructions
are
qualified
apparently
which
are
given
to
the
fbi.
he
stated
that
informer
participation
in
defense
strategy
sessions
it
wouldn’t
be
ethical,
it
wouldn’t
be
legal.
so
that
it
does
not
appear
that
the
ruling
of
the
fourth
circuit
varies
in
any
way
what
the
present
practice
of
the
stated
practice
is
in
south
carolina.
i
think
this
fail
safe
argument
also
overlooks
this
fact
that
a
person
would
decline
an
invitation
to
participate
in
defense
planning
sessions
for
a
number
of
reasons
and
some
of
them
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
that
that
person
was
an
agent.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
i
think
there
are
number
of
cases,
your
honor
which
established
that
proposition.
hoffa
for
example
assumed
that
caldwell
and
coplon
had
been
correctly
decided
and
in
coplon,
the
court
there
articulated
a
right
of
a
defendant
to
have
an
un-surveilled
defense
planning
relationship
with
an
attorney.
i
think
that
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,
of
course,
those
cases
involve
electronic
surveillance,
but
the
court
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
i’m
not
certain
i
understand
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,
i
think
that
it
would
be
protected
by
the
notion
that
the
right
to
confer
with
an
attorney
includes
the
notion
to
prepare
a
defense
and
preparation
of
defense
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,
there
are
cases,
your
honor
we
cited
in
our
brief
involving
the
attorney-client
privilege,
which
say
that
communications
made
between
joint
defendants
and
attorneys
is
protected
by
the
attorney-client
privilege
and
i
should
think
that
the
scope
of
the
protection
forwarded
by
the
sixth
amendment
would
not
be
less
than
that.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,
the
sixth
amendment
violation
would
not
exist
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
if
he
acted
without
informant
whatsoever,
i’d
(voice
overlap)
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
right.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
i
think
that
one
of
the
things
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
the
sixth
amendment
does
apply
against
the
government
i
think
is
the
answer
to
that
and
the
court
also
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,
i
think
it’s
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,
of
course
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
the
court
might
conclude
that
there
had
been
a
deliberate
waiver,
or
that
there
was
no
attorney-client
meeting
to
intrude,
or
that
there
had
been
no
intrusion
and
that
was
a
meeting
that
was
open
to
the
public
or
that
is
going
to
complete
publication
of
the
strategy
and
those
considerations
might
call
for
different
result
than
the
one
we
think
is
appropriate
here
where
there
was
prosecutorial
misconduct.
there
was
deliberate
intrusion
as
the
fourth
circuit
found
and
there
was
also
substantial
interference
with
the
right
to
prepare
for
the
trial.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
i
think
the
court
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,
we
might
not
be
here,
your
honor.
i
think
the
court
would
have
to
look
at
a
number
of
factors
if
there
was
no
intrusion
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
well,
there
would
be
no
intrusion
under
those
circumstances
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
we
would’ve
been
--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
no.
i
think
we
would’ve
been
much
less
surprise
because
what
the
government
did
here
is
that
it
deliberately
ruled
out
the
very
case
which
it
presented.
had
they
not
done
that,
had
weatherford
not
deliberately
said
that
he
was
not
going
to
be
there
when
he
knew
there
was
a
possibility
that
he
could
be
there.
had
he
not
done
that
then
the
defense
could
not
have
ruled
out
the
possibility
of
this
testimony
but
because
of
the
very
specific
misrepresentations
which
you
made,
the
very
case
that
was
presented
was
the
one
case
which
had
been
completely
rule
out.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
the
testimony
of
weatherford,
mr.
chief
justice.
