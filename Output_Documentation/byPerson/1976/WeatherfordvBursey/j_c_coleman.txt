mr.
j.
c.
coleman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
going
to
take
a
little
of
my
time
to
review
the
facts
which
i
realize
are
already
in
the
record.
however,
i
do
think
it’s
important
for
this
reason
to
show
a
little
more
clearly
the
relationship
between
the
two
principles
in
this
case
and
when
i
say
the
two
principles,
i
am
speaking
of
weatherford
and
bursey,
although
of
course
strom
is
a
defendant
and
was
the
south
carolina
law
enforcement
chief.
these
events
occurred,
the
events
leading
up
to
this
litigation
occurred
in
1970,
approximately
at
the
end
of
a
period
of
several
years
of
dissension
and
on
the
college
campuses
of
this
country
and
i
believe
other
parts
of
the
world
as
well.
weatherford
was
a
salaried
undercover
police
agent.
i
think
that’s
important
to
remember
in
this
case,
not
controlling
but
important.
he
has
been
referred
to
in
the
case
as
a
paid
informer
and
i
guess
in
the
broad
sense,
he
was,
but
nevertheless,
he
was
a
hired,
salaried
member
of
the
south
carolina
law
enforcement
division
assigned
to
undercover
work
as
opposed
to
an
informer
who
might
be
paid
by
the
job
or
by
the
persons
he
turned
in.
he
was
not
that
type
of
individual.
he
was
also
a
student
at
the
university
of
south
carolina.
his
principal
assignment
was
to
report
to
the
other
defendant,
strom
who
was
and
is
the
chief
or
head
of
the
south
carolina
law
enforcement
division
which
is
of
course,
the
chief
police
agency
or
state
police
of
south
carolina
other
than
the
state
highway
patrol.
the
plaintiff
bursey,
the
plaintiff
below
bursey,
of
course,
was
a
student
at
the
university
of
south
carolina
and
the
two
became
very
close
friends.
they
were
not
simply
acquaintances.
they
visited
each
other
in
their
homes.
they
associated
with
each
other
in
various
campus
activity
groups.
i
believe
the
testimony
in
the
record
shows
that
at
least
on
one
occasion,
bursey
and
weatherford
were
co-chairpersons,
i
don’t
know
where
group,
on
the
campus
of
the
university
of
south
carolina.
the
record
would
show
further,
i
think,
that
weatherford
later
married
a
very
close
friend,
a
roommate
of
mr.
bursey’s
wife.
so,
they
were
much
closer
than
mere
acquaintances
and
we
think
that
that
is
important
in
this
case.
this
association
went
on
and
of
course,
bursey
was
completely
without
any
knowledge
that
weatherford
was
an
undercover
agent
and
the
two,
together
with
two
other
persons,
who
do
not
really
enter
this
case
except
that
they
participated
in
the
event
in
march
of
1970
in
order
to
demonstrate
their
opposition
to
the
vietnam
war
afflicted
considerable
damage
to
the
personal
property
and
the
real
property
of
the
selective
service
office,
the
draft
board
in
columbia,
south
carolina.
admittedly,
strom,
the
police
chief
had
been
given
prior
notice
of
this
crime
by
weatherford.
weatherford
did
participate
with
bursey
and
two
others
in
the
crime
and
although
there
were
police
agents
in
the
building,
who
had
been
placed
there
in
order
to
either
stop
the
crime
or
capture
the
criminals,
were
unable
to
do
so
and
the
four
persons
escaped.
that
was
early
in
the
morning
hours,
i
believe,
of
march
20,
1970.
later
that
same
day,
from
information
furnished
to
chief
strom
by
his
undercover
agent
weatherford,
weatherford
and
bursey
were
arrested
on
the
campus
of
the
university
of
south
carolina,
charged
with
the
crime
of
malicious
destruction
of
personal
and
real
property,
a
statutory
crime
under
the
law
of
south
carolina.
both
were
jailed
on
the
same
charge
and
weatherford
soon
thereafter
was
released
through
an
arrangement
made
by
strom
and
bursey
stayed
in
jail,
i
believe,
for
some
12
days
before
he
was
enable
to
put
a
bond
and
obtained
his
release.
thereafter,
and
i
think
the
record
is
clear
on
this
with
certain
testimonials,
although
there
was
not
a
specific
finding
of
fact
by
the
trial
judge
on
this
particular
point.
it
was
decided
and
it
was
desirable
from
the
state’s
viewpoint
to
have
the
undercover
agent,
weatherford
continue
as
an
undercover
agent
on
the
university
of
south
carolina
campus
as
long
as
he
could
because
he
was
a
valuable
man
according
to
the
testimony
and
at
that
time,
i
believe,
the
testimony
is
that
he
was
the
only
agent,
only
undercover
agent
on
the
university
of
south
carolina
campus
in
the
employ
of
sled.
it
would
have
been
impossible
with
the
very
close
relationship
between
weatherford
and
bursey,
for
bursey
to
have
been
--
to
reveal
himself
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
do
anything
unusual
without
raising
very
great
suspicion.
and
in
order
to
see
that
weatherford
was
not
forced
to
deal
with
bursey’s
lawyer
or
he
was
not
forced
to
make
an
explanation
as
to
why
he
did
not
wish
to
be
represented
by
bursey’s
lawyer,
an
explanation
that
would
hardly
have
been
plausible,
the
state
solicitor
john
w.
ford
arranged
which
was
admittedly
a
false
arrangement
for
one
before
a
local
attorney,
frank
taylor,
in
columbia
a
well-known
attorney
to
pose
as
weatherford’s
attorney
in
this
particular
charge.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
he
is
a
circuit
solicitor
and
the
particular
circuit
he
serves
has
two
counties
in
it.
south
carolina
has
16
different
circuits
varying
in
size,
from
two
counties
to
five.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
he
was
the
prosecutor.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
that’s
correct.
under
south
carolina
law,
he
is
entitled
as
solicitor
although
it
is
the
--
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
yes.
he
arranged
for
this
false
representation
or
dummy
representation,
however,
it
might
be
put
by
attorney
taylor
of
weatherford
and
that’s
admittedly
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
weatherford’s
cover.
thereafter,
both
men
went
about
their
normal
life
with
the
exception
or
the
inclusion
whichever
it
might
be,
of
two
meetings.
there’s
some
mention
of
maybe
a
third
meeting
but
no
particular
testimony
with
regard
to
the
details.
i
think
the
testimony
read
as
a
whole
indicates
there
were
two
meetings
at
which
bursey
was
present,
his
attorney,
mr.
wise
from
greenwood,
south
carolina
approximately
70
miles
from
columbia
was
present
and
of
course,
weatherford
was
present.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
he
was
released
on
appeal
bond,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
not
an
appeal
bond,
i
beg
your
pardon,
but
on
bond
--
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
--
to
prepare
for
trial.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
was
on
bond
i
think
$12,500.00.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
purportedly
out
on
bond.
that
was
admittedly
not
a
true
situation.
there
were
two
meetings
involving
the
plaintiff
weatherford
or
the
plaintiff
bursey,
weatherford
and
bursey’s
attorney,
wise,
one
was
at
a
party
at
bursey’s
house,
i
believe
it’s
described
as
an
aclu
party,
it
makes
no
difference
except
that
it
was
a
social
event.
and
during
the
course
of
that
social
event,
i
believe
the
testimony
is
that
weatherford
and
bursey
and
bursey’s
attorney,
wise
got
away
from
the
majority
of
the
crowd
somewhere
out
in
the
field
somewhere
and
did
go
into
a
discussion
of
this
particular
case.
there’s
a
finding
of
fact
by
the
circuit
judge
that
weatherford
never
did
categorically
and
specifically
denied
that
he
was
an
agent.
there
was
quite
naturally
in
a
case
like
this,
there
would
be
and
there
was
in
this
case,
a
general
discussion
between
the
three
as
to
whether
or
not
an
informer
or
undercover
agent
or
something
of
that
nature
might
be
involved
in
the
case.
there
was
some
discussion
by
weatherford
of
that
in
response
to
discussions
by
the
other
two.
weatherford
i
believe
did
state
upon,
maybe
on
that
occasion
or
maybe
in
another,
but
he
did
state
that
he
would
not
testify
in
the
case
against
bursey.
that
would
normally
come
up
because
i
think
in
every
criminal
case
involving
multiple
defendants,
there’s
always
a
question
of
whether
one
is
going
to
be
approached
by
the
authorities
and
asked
to
tie-in
state’s
evidence
in
a
plea
bargaining
situation
and
weatherford
denied
that,
i
think
it
was
necessary
that
he
do
so.
he
had
to
do
that
or
either
state
that
he
was
going
to
testify
and
had
he
made
such
an
assertion
as
that,
i’m
quite
sure
that
his
cover
would
have
disappeared
completely
and
he
could
no
longer
have
operated
as
an
undercover
agent
on
the
campus.
and
i
think
that’s
true
whether
or
not
bursey
and
his
attorney
might
have
deducted
from
that
fact
that
weatherford
was
an
agent.
his
effectiveness,
certainly,
would
have
disappeared
whether
he
was
an
agent
or
whether
he
simply
was
going
to
testify
to
save
his
own
skin
at
the
trial.
i
think
it’s
clear
that
this
meeting
was
without
question,
arranged
by
bursey.
it
was
not
sought
out
by
weatherford.
not
in
any
degree
and
with
the
closeness,
the
close
personal
relationship
of
these
two
men,
it
would’ve
been
impossible
for
bursey
to
avoid
such
occasional
contacts
as
these.
i
think
rather
than
being
against
weatherford,
it’s
rather
to
his
credit
that
he
limited
such
meetings
to
only
two
during
these
nearly
four
months
period
between
the
time
of
the
crime
and
the
time
of
the
trial.
now
the
only
other
occasion,
as
i
recall
the
evidence,
that
there
was
a
meeting
between
the
three,
that
is
weatherford,
bursey,
and
bursey’s
attorney,
was
on
an
occasion
that
was
brought
about
entirely
by
bursey
and
his
attorney
wise.
the
testimony
shows
that,
and
their
own
testimony
shows
that
they
came
to
columbia
without
having
made
prior
arrangements,
not
even
giving
prior
information
to
bursey
that
they
were
coming,
i
mean,
to
weatherford
that
they
were
coming
and
went
to
weatherford
residence
and
he
was
not
there.
they
guessed
that
he
might
be
at
the
house
of
a
friend
of
weatherford,
went
there
and
as
it
turned
out,
he
had
been
there
and
would
return
very
soon
and
did
return.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
yes.
and
i
will
very,
very
quickly.
i
was
simply
going
over
these
facts
to
support
really
our
first
proposition
that
these
circumstances
do
not
constitute
an
intrusion
at
all,
that
there
was
no
intrusion,
that
there
was
a
presence
by
weatherford
at
these
two
conferences,
there
were
necessary
presences.
they
were
necessitated
by
a
legitimate
state
interest
of
the
state
to
maintain
weatherford’s
cover
and
of
course
his
own
legitimate
interest
to
maintain
that
cover
plus
the
fact
that
there
was
some
fear
in
some
people’s
minds
that
his
life
might
be
endangered
if
his
cover
had
been
blown
at
that
point.
now,
the
fourth
circuit
does
hold
as
i
read
it,
that
the
mere
presence
of
weatherford
at
these
attorney-client
meetings
constituted
a
per
se
sixth
amendment
violation
of
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
and
the
black
and
o’brien
cases
are
cited
as
authority
for
that
proposition.
the
coplon
and
caldwell
cases
from
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
are
cited
in
support.
we
do
not
agree
that
black
and
o’brien
stand
for
such
a
per
se
proposition.
as
far
as
this
particular
point
is
concerned,
that
is
the
violation
of
the
constitutional
right
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
i
can’t
see
or
i
stand
to
be
corrected
that
it
makes
a
lot
of
difference
whether
this
court
sent
those
cases
back
simply
for
a
hearing
on
whether
or
not
there
was
damage
of
prejudice
or
whether
they
sent
them
back
for
a
new
trial
really
for
the
same
purpose
and
i
think
it’s
the
same
thing,
insofar
as
this
particular
point
is
involved.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
that
an
invalid
(inaudible)
,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
that
is
exactly
our
point
that
black
and
o’brien
are
simply
not
support
of
the
--
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
for
any
per
se
rule.
yes
sir,
exactly.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
i
think
one
case
involved
the
intrusion
of
a
police
agent
of
some
description.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
i
believe
that
the
black
case
was
involved
in
electronic
surveillance
yes
sir,
and
of
course,
i
think
both
coplon
and
caldwell
did
involve
electronic
surveillance
cases.
we
submit
further
that
the
facts
of
the
coplon,
caldwell
cases
and
the
o’brien
and
the
black
cases
are
so
forth
different
from
the
facts
in
this
bursey
case
as
to
make
them
inapplicable
in
any
event.
in
those
cases,
there
was
a
deliberate,
admitted,
affirmative
intrusion
by
the
government
on
the
attorney-client
relationship.
it
was
certainly
not
necessitated
by
any
legitimate
governmental
interest
as
we
think
the
case
is
in
bursey.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
justice
marshall,
we
do
not
claim
that
as
being
a
legitimate
state
interest.
we
simply
say
that
the
--
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
we
say
that
the
maintenance
of
the
identity
of
the
agent
weatherford
or
the
maintenance
of
his
cover
was
the
legitimate
state
interest.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
well,
we
think
of
course
the
federal
constitutional
issue
is
there,
but
we
say
that
--
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
that
of
course
could’ve
been
done,
sir.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
however,
as
you
say,
it
is
our
position
that
this
was
necessary
in
those
circumstances
to
--
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
no,
sir
i
can’t
agree
with
its
analogous
although
i
see
your
point.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
not
is
south
carolina,
as
i
understand
it.
however,
and
as
i
remember
--
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
oh!
short
of
a
year
or
something
like
that.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
yes,
there
could’ve
been
another
agent.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
i
admit
that
i
would’ve
done
it.
i
can’t
say
it
was
wrong
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
i
cannot
say
that
i
feel
that
that
is
--
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
not
in
those
circumstances?
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
not
in
my
opinion
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
i
don’t
think
it’s
good.
i
wouldn’t
consider
it
good.
no,
sir.
i,
however,
think
it’s
necessary
sometimes.
well,
i
think
it’s
necessary.
unfortunately,
of
course,
the
use
of
undercover
agents
is
necessary
in
police
work,
i
feel
and
i
do
feel
that
what
was
done
in
this
case
was
necessary
and
that
it
did
not
and
cannot
be
characterized
as
the
petitioner
--
as
the
plaintiff
below
bursey
has
attempted
to
characterize
it
as
a
deliberate
effort
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
to
mislead
mr.
bursey.
it
was
not
that.
it
has
no
–
there’s
no
possible
way
that
it
can
be
characterized
as
that,
as
i
can
see
it.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
well,
the
only
case
cited
by
the
fourth
circuit
in
support
of
the
rule
that
there
would
be
a
damage
action
is
the,
i
believe,
via
against
cliff
from
the
third
circuit
and
that
case
is
reported
in
support
of
the
fourth
circuit’s
holding
that
there
can
be
a
1983
action,
even
though
there
might
not
be
a
provable
damage
to
the
defendant,
to
the
criminal
offender
in
the
case.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
that’s
correct,
sir.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
the
way
it
was
for
the
defendants.
i
think
however
--
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
i
think
that’s
correct.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
no,
sir.
i
believe
that’s
correct.
in
that
case,
however,
the
court
said
that
what
was
done
there,
of
course,
was
not
an
intrusion
into
the
client-attorney
relationship.
it
was,
i
believe,
an
action
by
a
prison
head
and
some
guards
to
cut
off
prematurely
a
conference
between
a
murder
defendant,
i
believe
it
was,
and
his
attorney
and
it
was
alleged
there
that
that
was
an
unlawful,
unconstitutional
interference.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
i
don’t
know
when
--
yes
sir,
they
would
be
because
weatherford
was
the
very
first
witness
and
of
course,
at
the
criminal
trial.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
bursey
was
convicted.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
he
took
no
appeal.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
oh,
yes.
he
did
fled
the
state
after
his
conviction.
he
filed
an
appeal
bond
and
was
released
and
thereafter
fled
the
state
and
was
not
apprehended
for
approximately
two
years.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
he
was
apprehended,
came
back
to
serve
his
sentence
and
then
after
that
--
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
did
not
appeal
his
criminal
--
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
i
think
not,
sir.
i
think
the
appeal
time
would
have
expired
then.
however,
he
didn’t
flee
immediately.
there
was
ample
time
and
i
think
the
record
will
show
this
testimony
that
appeal
was
discussed
between
mr.
bursey
and
his
attorney
and
it
was
decided
by
the
attorney
that
the
appeal
would
be
fruitless
and
therefore,
that
it
would
not
be
made.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
no,
we
did
not
sir.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
well,
--
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
the
fourth
circuit
has
remanded
it.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
the
fourth
circuit
indicates
that
the
other
defenses
not
originally
raised
might
be
open.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
yes,
i
believe
so,
yes
sir.
i
would
hope
that
that
is
an
explanation
of
our
position
on
that
particular
point.
the
other
big
question
of
course
with
the
fair
trial
issue
and
the
fourth
circuit
rule
as
we
understand
it
that
the
simple
neglect
of
the
state
to
inform
the
defendant
bursey
or
his
attorney
that
there
was
an
eyewitness
in
the
case
which
had
not
been
previously
known,
was
sufficient
in
itself
to
constitute
unfair
trial
and
violation
of
the
constitutional
right
and
of
course
would
have
supported
a
reversal
of
the
conviction.
mr.
j.
c.
coleman
that
is
certainly
a
possibility.
i
have
not
thought
out
that
process
to
the
point
of
taking
that
prima
position.
we
are
on
that
position
of
course,
that’s
number
one.
number
two
is
that
even
if
he
had,
and
could
show
a
violation
now
and
that
the
action
has
been
brought,
we
took
the
position
in
the
circuit
court,
that
it
did
not
state
a
course
of
action
and
of
course,
that
was
overruled
by
the
circuit
court.
the
third
issue
decided
by
the
court
which
i
wish
to
get
to
very
briefly
is
the
liability
of
chief
strom
as
opposed
to
that
of
weatherford.
it’s
clear,
i
think,
that
the
defendant
strom
did
not
know
that
weatherford
was
actually
attending
conferences
between
bursey
and
his
attorney.
he
did
know
and
he
did
order,
of
course,
the
maintenance
of
the
cover
in
that
he
was
fully
aware
of
the
fact
that
weatherford
was
going
about
his
business
and
had
not
revealed
these
things
to
bursey.
but
the
record
is
clear
that
he
did
not
know
that
there
was
any
conference
between
mr.
bursey
and
his
attorney
and
we
feel
that
the
fourth
circuit
was
clearly
in
error
in
ruling
that
he
either
did
know
it
or
should
have
known
it
in
those
circumstances.
we
think
the
fourth
circuit
puts
the
knowledge
of
strom
on
the
wrong
set
of
circumstances.
it
puts
the
knowledge
of
strom
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
maintenance
of
the
cover
when
it’s
clear
that
there
was
no
knowledge
on
the
part
of
either
strom
or
the
solicitor
ford,
for
that
matter,
that
there
had
been
attorney-client
attendances
by
weatherford.
