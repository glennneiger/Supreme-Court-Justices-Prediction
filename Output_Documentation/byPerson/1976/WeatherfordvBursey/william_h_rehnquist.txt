justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
didn’t
plead
a
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel
in
your
pleadings
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
right
to
counsel
depends
on
the
pendency
of
a
criminal
proceeding,
doesn’t
it?
it’s
not
a
separate
and
independent
rights
such
as
the
fourth
amendment
freedom
from
unlawful
searches
and
seizures?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it’s
dependent
on
the
impending
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
it
was
change
of
strategy.
isn’t
there
a
finding
in
the
district
court
that
they
had
originally
not
intended
to
call
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
why
did
you
say
a
moment
ago
that
he
knew
he
was
going
to
testify
from
the
beginning?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
isn’t
quite
the
same
thing
as
saying,
he
knew?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
those
are
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
for
continuance
of
that
basis?
