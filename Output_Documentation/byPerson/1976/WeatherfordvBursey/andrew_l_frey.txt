mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
reading
through
the
briefs
of
this
case
and
the
opinions
below,
one
is
struck
by
an
almost
schizophrenic
character
that
the
case
has
assumed.
it
has
in
effect
three
different
faces.
first,
is
the
case
described
in
the
findings
and
conclusions
of
the
district
court.
central
among
them
are
the
findings
that
the
state’s
motive
in
allowing
petitioner
weatherford
to
proceed
as
he
did,
was
to
protect
his
cover,
so
that
he
could
continue
investigations
of
other
matters.
secondly,
that
the
state
initially
hoped
to
make
its
case
against
respondent
without
weatherford’s
testimony
and
that
the
decision
to
call
him
as
a
witness
at
trial
was
a
last
minute
decision
by
the
prosecutor.
third,
that
weatherford’s
role
in
the
conversations
with
respondent
and
his
lawyer
was
limited,
involved
no
attempt
to
secure
defense
strategy
information
and
entail
discovery
of
little
that
was
surprising
or
highly
significant
about
the
respondent’s
defense
strategy.
and
fourth,
that
no
information
acquired
by
weatherford
during
these
meetings
was
conveyed
to
the
prosecutor.
and
the
second
case
is
that
perceived
by
the
court
of
appeals
which
accepted
virtually
all
of
the
facts
found
by
the
district
court
but
applied
a
radically
different
legal
analysis.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
were
all
accepted
yes,
but
substituting
certain
per
se
requirements
for
the
balancing
of
interest
approach
that
the
district
court
took.
and
the
third
case
is
that
of
painted
by
respondent
in
his
brief
in
this
court.
the
case
is
malevolent
contrivance
by
the
state
to
spy
upon
and
sabotage
his
defense.
our
position
in
this
case
is
based
essentially
on
the
facts
found
by
the
district
court.
and
our
concern
in
this
case
is
with
the
legal
principles
announced
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
govern
those
facts.
accordingly,
i
will
not
address
at
any
length
the
factual
controversies
with
which
this
court
is
confronted
except
to
make
two
observations
in
passing.
the
first
is
that,
it
seems
to
me
difficult
to
sustain
the
notion
that
petitioner’s
actions
in
this
case
were
motivated
to
any
significant
degree
by
an
attempt
to
secure
advantage
over
respondent
in
his
prosecution.
with
petitioner
weatherford’s
testimony
available,
the
state’s
case
was
secure
and
it’s
difficult
to
perceive
as
a
practical
matter
how
the
state
could’ve
imagined
it
would
strengthen
its
case
by
nondisclosure
of
weatherford’s
status.
the
second
point
seems
to
me
quite
ironic
in
light
of
respondent’s
present
posture
in
this
case.
the
disclosure
of
weatherford’s
status
as
an
agent
of
the
state
police,
far
from
helping
respondent’s
defense
was
fatal
to
it.
respondent’s
best
hope
of
acquittal
lay
in
a
decision
by
the
prosecution
to
maintain
weatherford’s
cover
past
the
trial,
rather
than
to
reveal
his
status
by
allowing
him
to
testify.
had
weatherford
done
what
respondent
now
insists
he
should
have
done,
the
hopes
for
a
successful
defense
would
simply
have
been
dashed
sooner
than
in
fact
they
were
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
had
he
not
maintained
his
cover
and
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--
had
not
said
to
bursey,
“i’m
an
agent.
i’m
an
informant
and
i’m
going
to
testify
at
trial,”
but
had
he
maintained
his
cover
as
respondent
now
argues,
he
should
not
have
done
or
attempted
to
do
at
all,
had
he
maintained
his
cover
through
the
trial,
the
respondent
had
a
hope
of
acquittal
and
that
was
respondent’s
trial
strategy,
so
to
speak.
now,
turning
to
the
legal
questions,
we
disagree
with
two
central
ingredients
of
the
court
of
appeals’
holding.
the
first
is
the
adoption
of
a
per
se
prohibition.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
he
did.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
he
didn’t.
he
denied
the
requisite
malicious
intent
that
was
an
element
of
the
offense
under
the
statute.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
as
indeed
seemed
inevitable
in
the
face
of
the
prosecution’s
evidence.
the
first
part
of
the
court
of
appeals’
holding
to
which
we
object
is
the
adoption
of
the
per
se
prohibition
upon
contact
of
any
kind
between
undercover
agents
or
informants
and
the
defense
even
where
such
contacts
come
about
because
of
an
effort
to
maintain
an
agent’s
cover.
the
second
holding
with
which
we
disagree
is
the
requirement
that
the
prosecution
reveal
in
advance
of
trial
the
identity
of
an
undercover
informant
who
would
plan
to
use
as
witness
at
trial.
now,
i
might
say
justice
marshall
that
in
our
assessment
of
the
case,
we
don’t
think
that
weatherford
was
wrong
in
attending
the
meeting.
we
think
it
would’ve
been
desirable
had
that
been
avoidable
and
certainly,
we
think
it
would’ve
been
wrong
for
him
to
take
any
affirmative
steps
to
insinuate
himself
into
the
defense
camp.
but
confronted,
as
he
was,
with
an
unexpected
situation,
where
respondent’s
lawyer
asked
if
he
could
interview
weatherford
which
was
the
substance
of
at
least
one
of
the
meetings,
it
seems
to
me
that
even
the
need
to
maintain
the
cover
which
the
district
court
found
was
the
motive
in
acting
here,
it
was
not
improper
for
weatherford.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
don’t
think
it’s
accurate
to
say
that
they
got
the
information.
this
is
an
important
part
of
the
case
is
that
they
got,
they
being
the
prosecution
got
no
information.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
those
are
some
of
the
facts
the
district
court
found
that
the
reason
that
they
didn’t
need
the
cover
or
the
reason
that
they
elected
to
abandon
the
cover
which
is
really
what
happened,
was
a
fear
that
the
cover
had
been
blown
by
independent
incidents.
in
any
event
the
decision
about
the
cover
and
about
whether
to
call
weatherford
as
the
witness
was
made
by
the
prosecutor
in
the
findings
of
the
district
court
are
unequivocal
and
i
think
supported
by
the
record
that
the
prosecutor
was
not
aware
of
any
of
the
contacts
between
weatherford
and
bursey
or
bursey’s
attorney.
when
he
made
the
decision,
these
were
two
independent
events.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
that
would
probably
be
inadmissible.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
in
terms
of
our
analysis,
there
are
two
ingredients
in
a
possible
sixth
amendment
or
due
process,
i’m
not
sure
what
the
ground
is,
it’s
violation
for
intrusion
into
defense
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think,
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
constitutional
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
occurred
when
the
evidence
is
offered.
i
mean,
that
was
certainly
true
in
massiah
where
the
constitutional
violation
that
was
found
by
the
court
there
was
not
in
conducting
the
further
investigation
of
the
offense,
but
in
using
in
evidence
against
the
defendant
at
trial,
his
statements
made
in
a
period
pre-trial,
port
indictment
and
pre-trial
period.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
but
it’s
not
because
the
sitting
in
is
itself
a
violation
of
standing
alone
in
our
view.
it’s
because
the
utilization
by
the
prosecution
of
any
fruits
of
that
activity
would
be
a
violation.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think.
well,
our
position
is
twofold.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
are
two.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that’s
not
necessarily
the
end
of
a
civil
case.
the
point
that
the
chief
justice
made
which
i
don’t
believe
(voice
overlap)
was
raised
in
the
petition.
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
trial.
you
wouldn’t
have
to
have
a
new
trial
at
which
that
evidence
was
excluded,
i
think.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
had
not.
we
addressed
that
in
the
brief
because
we
felt
that
this
was
a
consideration
of
which
the
court
should
be
aware
in
evaluating
this
case.
i
don’t
understand
that
it
has
been
an
issue
presented
by
the
court
or
claim
raised
by
the
state
so
far
in
the
proceedings.
i’m
not
clear
on
whether
or
not
the
state
can
raise
it.
let
me
just
say
and
it’s
not
a
matter
that
it
is
a
central
interest
to
the
federal
government
in
this
case,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
whether
there
is
a
civil
action
depends
upon
what
the
violation
was.
if
the
violation
was
sitting
in
the
meeting
as
in
bivens
case,
the
violation
is
the
illegal
search
and
seizure
itself
then
i
think
an
independent
civil
action
would
lie
regardless
of
what
happened
in
the
criminal
trial.
if
on
the
other
hand,
the
violation
was
trial
related,
and
had
to
do
with
the
introduction
of
the
evidence
at
trial
then
in
our
view
the
defendant’s
failure
to
take
measures
that
were
available
to
him
at
that
time
might
foreclose
his
action
and
certainly
would
reduce
his
damages
materially.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
first
object
to
the
introduction
of
this
evidence,
object
if
it
was
improper
for
weatherford
to
testify
at
the
trial,
the
defendant
could’ve
objected.
had
the
objection
been
denied,
he
could’ve
appealed
and
indeed
in
this
case,
i
believe,
the
district
court
found
that
even
after
he
was
recaptured,
he
had
a
post-conviction
relief
available
under
south
carolina
law.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
suggest
in
our
brief,
he
would
not
be.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
we
suggest
that
as
long
as
he
gives
truthful
testimony,
at
least,
he’s
absolutely
immune
from
liability.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
yes.
for
that,
he
would
be
liable.
this
is
somewhat
beside
the
points
that
are
central
concern
to
the
federal
government
in
this
case.
now,
we
have
no
doubt
that
the
constitution
affords
substantial
protections
to
the
confidentiality
of
relations
between
a
criminal
defendant
and
his
attorney,
and
that
this
extends
to
many
facets
of
defense
strategy
planning.
but
we
can
agree
that
this
right
of
confidentiality
is
so
sweeping
as
to
prohibit
virtually
any
contact
between
government
agents
and
the
defense
regardless
of
the
government’s
reasons
for
permitting
a
situation
in
which
such
contact
comes
about,
regardless
of
the
nature
of
the
contact,
and
regardless
of
the
impact
that
the
contact
actually
has
upon
the
fairness
of
the
criminal
trial.
so,
when
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
it
was
of
no
consequence
that
the
intrusion
here
was
not
for
the
purpose
of
information,
but
was
to
maintain
weatherford’s
cover,
we
think
it
unjustifiably
slighted
important
societal
interest
in
protecting
the
flow
of
information
about
crime
to
law
enforcement
authorities
and
the
safety
of
undercover
agents
and
informants.
and
we’ve
argued
in
this
case
that
certain
critical
factors
must
be
examined
in
determining
whether
a
sixth
amendment
violation
has
occurred.
the
most
important
of
these
is
whether
the
so-called
intrusion
into
defense
counsels
is
active
or
passive.
a
violation
should
be
found
in
our
view,
whenever
there’s
been
a
deliberate
effort
to
penetrate
the
defense
camp,
so
that
the
prosecution
may
acquire
defense
strategy
information
that
can
aid
it
its
adversarial
struggle.
this
is
hopefully
a
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that
would
be
the
situation
i
think
caldwell
and
hoffa
were
dealing.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
a
constitutional
violation;
i
am
not
--
i
am
a
little
uneasy
about
resting
it
on
the
sixth
amendment
and
i
have
to
hark
back
to
cases
like
herring
and
in
faretta
where
the
court
is
somewhat
divided
on
whether
what
the
roots
of
some
of
these
rights
are.
but
i
do
think
it
would
be
constitutionally
impermissible
for
the
prosecution
in
this
manner
to
invade
the
defense
camp.
now,
a
violation
also
may
occur
when
there
has
been
an
actual
acquisition
by
the
prosecution
by
whatever
means
of
defense
strategy
information,
and
coplon
and
black
are
examples
of
this.
now,
i
haven’t
very
much
time
remaining
but
i
want
to
make
a
couple
of
points
that
have
come
up
in
their
briefing.
one
is
the
notion
that
the
court
of
appeals
fear
to
entertain
that
the
undercover
agent
is
a
member
of
the
prosecution.
i
think
that
notion
is
wrong
in
the
context
of
this
case.
respondents
cites
a
number
of
brady
type
cases
and
those
are
cases
where
i
think
the
notion
of
the
prosecution
being
held
responsible
for
knowledge
of
the
police
is
far
more
appropriate
because
those
are
cases
in
which
what
is
at
stake
is
a
direct
impact
on
guilt
or
innocence
by
the
withholding
or
the
availability
to
the
defense
of
evidence.
now,
this
is
not
a
case
of
that
sort
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
court
can
find
in
fact
that
a
barrier
has
been
established,
a
quarantine
around
the
agent’s
contact
with
the
attorneys
and
that
is
not
been
transmitted
to
the
prosecution
at
any
form
that
it
could
be
utilized,
there
would
be
no
violation.
i
also
think
that
the
reasons
for
whatever
per
se
rule
there
may
be
in
black
and
even
o’brien
don’t
extend
to
this
case,
first
of
all,
there’s
a
distinction
between
cases
that
involve
intrusions
in
cases
that
involve
prosecution
access
to
defense
information
and
these
cases
are
discussed
in
respondent’s
brief
and
many
court
of
appeals
cases.
i
think
what
one
can
distill
from
these
cases
is
that
where
the
prosecution
has
acquired
defense
strategy
information,
and
when
this
fact
does
come
out
until
the
trial
is
ended
and
therefore
can’t
be
explored
in
the
context
of
the
criminal
trial
itself,
the
remedy
has
been
to
order
a
new
trial
and
that’s
what
happened
in
black
at
least
and
a
number
of
the
other
cases.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
where
there’s
been
an
intrusion,
but
there
has
not
been
established
that
information
has
reached
the
prosecution
and
the
prosecution
may
thereby
have
gained
an
unfair
advantage
in
the
trial
process
itself,
there
has
been
not
a
per
se
rule
but
an
inquiring
into
prejudice.
we
think
this
is
a
case
on
the
findings
of
the
district
court
where
you
have
the
intrusion
perhaps
but
not
the
unfair
prosecutorial
advantage
that
has
been
gained.
now,
i
just
want
to
comment
then
briefly,
if
i
have
a
minute
left,
on
the
second
point
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals,
which
is
the
just
the
duty
imposed
upon
the
prosecution
to
disclose
the
identity
of
an
undercover
agent.
now,
brady
which
the
court
principally
relied
on
is
plainly
inapplicable.
this
is
not
an
exculpatory
evidence
case.
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
amounts
in
our
view,
logically
can
only
mean
that
any
damaging
exculpatory
evidence
must
be
produced
by
the
prosecution
in
advance
of
trial.
the
policies
to
which
the
court
of
appeals
referred
which
are
set
forth
at
page
262
of
the
appendix
are
first
to
consider
whether
plea
bargaining
might
be
the
best
course.
well,
i’m
sorry
i
seem
to
have
run
out
of
time.
thank
you.
