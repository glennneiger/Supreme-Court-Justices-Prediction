mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
section
4141.29(d)(1)(a)
of
the
ohio
revised
code.
this
section
disqualifies
individuals
from
receiving
unemployment
benefits,
if
there
is
an
unemployment
that
was
due
to
a
labor
dispute
other
than
a
lockout
at
any
factory,
establishment
or
other
premises
located
in
this
or
any
other
state
that
is
wholly
owned
or
operated
by
the
employer
in
which
the
employee
is
or
was
last
employed.
this
is
commonly
referred
to
in
the
unemployment
field
as
the
functional
integrated
plant
theory
whereas
you
have
multiple
plants,
one
employer,
and
all
of
the
plants
operate
as
a
single
unit
that
produces
one-single
product
or
end-products.
plaintiff-appellee
represent
approximately
1250
steel
workers
who
became
unemployed
as
a
result
of
a
strike
at
the
wholly
owned
and
operated
coal
mines
of
the
steel
companies
which
cut-off
the
supply
of
coal
that
the
steel
companies
needed
to
continue
production
in
ohio.
plaintiff’s
denied
benefits
by
the
administrator
because
of
disqualification
in
our
law.
there
is
an
appeal
pending
before
the
board
of
review
in
the
ohio
bureau
of
employment
services
with
appellees
and
their
class
and
this
was
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
during
the
pendency
of
appeal
before
the
board,
the
appellees
filed
an
action
in
the
federal
district
court,
northern
district,
and
eastern
division
in
cleveland
as
a
class
action
under
42
u.s.c.
1983
for
a
declaratory
judgment
seeking
as
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute
and
also
for
injunctive
relief
in
the
way
of
past
benefits.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
it
was,
yes.
appellees
alleged
that
the
ohio
statute
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
as
applied
because
it
violated
the
supremacy
clause
dealing
conflict
with
42
u.s.c.
sections
503(a)(1)
and
303(a)(1)
of
the
social
security
act.
additionally,
they
alleged,
that
it
was
a
violation
of
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
appellees
did
not
name
either
us
steel
or
republic
steel
in
the
district
court
as
the
party
defendants
as
required
under
the
ohio
statutes
as
an
interested
party,
since
their
funds
are
drawn
against
because
payments
of
unemployment
benefits.
the
defendants
in
the
court
below
argued
that
the
case
was
not
a
proper
case
for
a
three-judge
district
court
and
an
action
for
injunction
damages.
during
the
oral
argument,
the
appellees
changed
it
from
money
damages
and
said
that
it
was
benefits.
plaintiff-appellee
has
failed
to
exhaust
their
remedy
at
law.
we
argued
that
the
plaintiff
and
his
co-worker
had
a
pending
appeal
before
the
board
of
review
and
the
court
should
not
hear.
plaintiff-appellee
has
failed
to
meet
the
requirements
of
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
23(b)(3).
the
class
was
a
definite
class
that
plaintiffs
would
furnish
names,
no
notice
was
given.
the
unemployment
compensation
laws
in
ohio
are
solely
the
state’s
concern
and
have
not
been
preempted
by
the
federal
government
and
we
argue
that
us
district
court
should
abstain
from
the
hearing
of
the
case,
for
two
reasons.
comity
and
that
they
are
already
were
in
the
state
administrative
process
and
could
go
up
through
the
process
to
the
state
courts,
to
the
federal
courts
in
the
normally
judicial
manner.
the
district
court
convened
a
three-judge
panel
to
determine
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
the
memorandum
opinion,
however,
the
three-judge
court
which
was
found
in
the
jurisdiction
statement
arise
on
page
48
held
that
injunctive
relief
was
proper
under
28
u.s.c.
2283
in
our
injunction
statute.
they
said
that
abstention
was
not
proper
in
the
instant
case
since
plaintiff
had
stated
a
good
cause
under
42
u.s.c.
1983.
the
ohio
courts
had
previously
ruled
on
the
validity
of
the
statutes,
therefore,
the
frugal
for
the
plaintiffs
to
go
through
the
process
again.
the
court
found
in
the
prerequisites
to
certification
that
the
prerequisites
of
certification
had
been
banned
under
23(a)
and
(b),
despite
as
i
said
no
fact
and
notice
was
given.
and
they
said
that
the
operative
effect
of
4141.29(d)(1)
was
disqualifies
benefits
to
plaintiffs
who
violate
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
clause
as
guaranteed
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
42
u.s.c.
1983.
we
generally
argued
at
oral
argument
that
granting
benefits
to
workers
laid
off
due
to
a
strike
in
a
parent
company
subsidiary
plant
would
in
effect
be
subsidizing
the
union
members
of
the
steel
workers.
granting
of
benefits
would
place
the
employer
in
an
unfair
disadvantage
in
negotiations
with
the
unions.
that
the
financial
burden
of
supporting
the
striking
members
is
shifted
from
the
unions
treasury
to
the
state
of
ohio,
it
is
conceivable
that
no
concerted
effort
by
the
mine
workers
to
negotiate
a
fair
settlement
would
be
pursued
until
the
employer
reached
the
financial
crisis.
the
difference
between
the
mine
workers
of
say
a
100
and
maybe
5,000
or
6,000
steel
workers,
you
can
see
the
impact
upon
the
employer’s
fund.
the
state
has
a
legitimate
purpose
in
protecting
the
physical
integrity
of
its
compensation
fund.
strikes
involving
large
corporations
such
as
us
steel,
the
auto
workers,
the
rubber
companies,
and
other
corporate
giants
involved
many
hundreds
and
thousands
of
employees
which
would
sometimes
last
many
weeks
further
depleting
our
funds.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
mr.
justice,
the
statute,
when
this
case
was
brought
up,
did
disqualify
benefits
if
it
was
a
wholly
owned
and
operated
subsidiary
that
went
on
strike
which
caused
the
main
plant
to
strike.
in
this
instant
case,
there
were
about
2,000
employees
involved
in
reno,
ohio,
cleveland,
youngstown,
warren
i
believe.
the
board
of
review
in
half
of
the
cases
found
that
the
employees
in
the
larine
plant,
for
instance,
were
qualified
for
benefits
because
under
some
tests
that
they
had
for
as
far
as
supplying
fuel,
they
had
a
50/50
test,
but
they
said,
“unless
the
main
plant
was
receiving
or
depending
on
the
subsidiary
for
more
than
50%
of
the
coal.
it
was
not
due
to
a
strike
or
labor
dispute,
but
it
was
caused
because
of
lack
of
fuel,
and
therefore,
a
lack
of
work.
therefore,
the
cleveland
and
reno
people
did
get
benefits,
which
is
on
appeal
by
the
steel
company
of
course.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
that
is
correct,
in
an
administrative
process.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
the
final
determination
has
not
been
made.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
that
is
that
they
are
entitled
to
it
and
say
“we
are
involuntary
unemployed,”
which
is
counter
to
the
statute.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
well,
they
say
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
they
would
have
to
reserve
that
till
they
got
to
the
common
pleas
court.
i
do
not
think
the
administrative
agency
or
the
bureau
is
bound
by
the
supreme
court
decisions
and
court
of
appeal
decisions
in
ohio
which
held
the
statute
constitutional,
and
therefore,
the
issue
of
constitutionality
would
not
get
into
it
until
they
got
to
next
level,
common
pleas
court,
court
of
appeals,
and
possibly
into
the
federal
judicial.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
this
is
an
issue
and
that
was
brought
up
by
the
amicus
afl-cio
that
i
believe
it
was
not
the
appellee’s
contention.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
well,
of
course
we
would
hopefully.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
i
settle
for
a
reverse
to
vacate
the
judgment
and
let
the
state
court
proceedings
go
on.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
mr.
justice,
i
do
not
think
the
remand
would
be
very
good
because
the
district
court
would
still
have
to
wait
for
the
administrative
hearing,
it
is
not
a
de
novo
trial.
the
administrative
process
would
still
have
to
go
through
the
board
of
review
and
then
they
could
appeal
to
the
state
courts
and
depending
on
the
evidence
in
the
case,
they
could
not
rule
that
they
could
be
entitled
to
benefits,
i
do
not
know.
each
case
was
on
a
fact-by-fact
basis.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
it
has
been
amended,
but
we
have
two
other
cases,
your
honor,
that
are
pending.
there
is
the
lordstown,
general
motors
with
several
thousand
people,
we
have
which
is
the
actual
case
that
is
in
court
of
appeals
in
ohio
and
we
also
have
one
in
youngstown
in
a
hospital
case
which
is
relatively
minor,
200
or
300
employees.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
there
has
not
been
any
in
this
particular,
in
this
instant
case
in
the
board
of
review
or
the
lower
level
administrative
proceedings,
but
we
have
had
a
case
in
1963.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
this
one
comes
from
directly
to
the
district
court
which
convened
the
three-judge
court
for
the
constitutional.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
i
guess
they
had
a
--
they
said
it
was
in
conflict
with
section
503
and
50…
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
well,
they
did
not
say
it
was
in
conflict
with
the
federal
statute
because
judge
celebrezze
requested
to
the
appellees,
in
fact
it
is
in
my
brief,
where
he
specifically
questioned
the
appellees
and
said,
“is
there
any
federal
law
that
you
can
tell
me
that
is
in
conflict
with
this
and
the
appellee
said
no,
they
do
not
have
any.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
well,
when
they
first
started
the
case,
they
said
it
was
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
preemption
document.
the
due
process,
equal
protection.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
that
was
in
the
complaint,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
no,
your
honor,
they
have
not
abandoned
it
since…
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
i
do
not
think
the
district
court
spoke
to
the
supremacy.
they
just…
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
well,
i
understood
that
they
are
from
the
lower
court;
they
just
said
there
was
a
constitutional
conflict
on
equal
protection
and
due
process.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
they
did
not
decide
that
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
i
am
complaining,
yes,
its
part
of
our
brief.
if
there
is
not
any
federal
statute
and
unless
you
have
a
federal
right
or
constitutional
right,
fundamental
right,
a
1983
action
is
inappropriate,
improper.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
but
there
has
to
exist
a
fundamental
right
or
statutory
right
which
there
is
not
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
the
whole
social
security
act
since
1935
under
stewart,
the
landmark
cases
at
this
court
decided
was
charles
e.
stewart
v.
davis
and
the
carmichael
v.
southern
colin
coke.
both
of
those
cases
held
that
this
was
a
state
federal
plan.
there
was
no
coercion
on
the
states
to
accept
the
plan,
they
were
free
to
take
it
or
reject
it
and
still
can,
that
the
only,
there
were
minimum
requirements
that
is
the
money.
the
employer
has
got
a
tax
break
of
up
to
90%
if
the
state
had
an
unemployment
plan
and
it
is
still
today
that
way.
the
minimum
requirement
was
that
the
secretary
of
labor
has
to
approve
our
plan
yearly.
the
funds
can
be
only
used
for
unemployment.
that
we
have
to
maintain
a
fiscal
soundness
in
our
plan
because
if
we
do
not,
we
are
not
only
loose
the
capital
improvement
money,
but
we
have
to
increase
either
the
tax
on
the
employer
by
way
of
increasing
his
weight
or
we
have
to
raise
the
base
or
we
have
to
use
a
combination
of
all
three
and
it
has
to
be
done
in
three
years.
as
you
notice
this
probably,
the
court
has
judicial
knowledge
that
more
than
31
states
that
are
already
bankrupt.
since
i
wrote
this
brief,
there
were
only
eight,
but
there
are
approximate
31
now
and
more
and
this
energy
crisis
has
even
caused
more
of
a
problem
because
ohio’s
funds
are
going
to
run
out
probably
or
were
going
to,
if
the
weather
had
not
turned
by
march
15.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
yes,
it
has
amended
its
law,
but
there
is
still
a
disqualification.
in
ohio’s
law
which
was
amended.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
1977,
january.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
oh,
wait
let
us
see,
1975.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
yes,
which
was
about
three
months,
but
did
not
go
in
affect
when
this
case
was…?
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
they
eliminated
a
part
of
the
disqualification,
but
there
is
still
a
disqualification.
the
elimination
was
as
in
this
case,
the
language
of
the
statute
said
that,
“no
individual
shall
be
disqualified”,
well
this
is
the
language
that
with
the
particular
interest
in
this
case.
“or
other
premises
located
in
this
or
any
other
state
and
owned
or
operated
by
the
employer
by
which
he
was
or
his
last
employee.”
although,
that
language
was
taken
out
so
that
the
location
of
out
of
state
or
away
from
the
premises
would
now
be
paid
benefits.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
well,
that
is
the
point
that
has
not
been
litigated
in
the
state
and
i
will
tell
you
why
mr.
justice.
the
statute,
the
part
that
was
amended,
the
rest
of
it
was
still
the
same
and
it
still
has
a
disqualification.
it
says
that
no
individual
shall
be
disqualified
from
benefits
unless
his
employer
is
a
wholly
own
subsidiary
of
the
employer
engaged
in
the
dispute.
so
they
take
it
out
and
it
is
still
in,
in
another
place
in
a
different
context.
so
there
is
still
possibly
disqualification
for
involuntary
unemployed
due
to
a
labor
dispute
which
has
not
been
litigated
yet.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
that
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
there
is
no
retroactivity
application
to
the
statute,
they
could
not.
the
central
issue
that
we
have
here
today
at
least
as
far
as
appellant’s
feelings
are,
that
it
is
more
than
a
question
of
just
adjudicating
their
rights
under
our
labor
dispute
statute.
we
think
that
is
a
central
issue
as
the
right
of
the
state
to
formulate
its
own
unemployment
programs
as
it
has
been
since
1935
when
the
social
security
act
was
first.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
it
is
part
of
our
jurisdiction
statement
as
an
exhibit,
which
was
signed
by
the
secretary
to
the
labor.
appellant’s
content
has
no
federal
right
to
unemployment
compensation
and
the
appellee’s
have
not
demonstrated
such
a
right
exists.
appellees
have
argued
that
the
ohio
labor
dispute
disqualification
as
appeared
in
1974,
1975
deprived
them
of
due
process.
in
order
to
have
a
constitutionally
secured
or
protected
right,
you
would
have
to
have
a
federal
statute
or
at
least
the
fundamental
right
before
you
reach
the
due
process
argument.
there
is
not
any
in
this
case.
in
paul
v.
davis
and
kelly
v.
johnson
last
year
decided
by
this
court,
the
court
recognized
that
due
process
does
not
extend
to
every
pursuit
in
inequality
suffered
by
the
hands
of
the
state,
but
rather
applies
only
where
there
is
involved
an
underlying
federal
or
constitutional
right.
the
due
process
arguments
made
by
appellee
can
be
deemed
viable
if
they
can
point
out
some
law
that
would
contravene
the
ohio
state
law.
section
503
(a)
of
the
social
security
act,
the
first
section
requires
approval
by
the
secretary
of
labor.
the
second
section
speaks
about
when
do
that
this
court
had
when
they
faced
java,
nothing
to
do
with
unemployment
benefit
eligibility.
section
303
states
that
payments
will
be
made
to
the
state
upon
approval
by
the
secretary
of
labor
of
our
plan.
there
is
no
where
that
we
have
been
able
to
find
or
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
the
appellees
have
been
able
to
find
that
applies
to
eligibility
for
benefits.
there
are
many
disqualifications
in
the
unemployment
field.
you
are
disqualified,
in
some
states
for
benefits
if
you
have
to
go
to
a
jury.
you
are
disqualified
if
you
are
ill.
you
are
disqualified
if
you
are
pregnant
within
the
timeframe
with
limitations.
you
are
disqualified
if
you
have
to
leave
your
job
to
follow
your
husband
or
wife
to
another
state.
so
there
are
many
types
of
disqualification.
you
have
to
first
qualify
for
twenty-six
weeks
eligibility
of
working
in
most
states.
you
have
a
one
week
disqualification.
you
have
got
strike
disqualifications,
labor
dispute
disqualifications.
some
cases
that
held
that
lack
of
transportation,
you
are
disqualified.
it
is
not
up
to
the
employer
to
furnish
it.
so
there
are
all
kinds
of
disqualifications.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
that
is
correct
your
honor,
there
is
26
weeks
in
most
cases,
but
the
time
for
qualification
varies,
the
monetary
amount
varies,
the
earned
amount
to
qualify
varies,
there
are
50
states
with
50
different
variables.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
cut-off
date.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
that
is
correct,
except.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
well,
the
federal
government
came
in
under
the
emergency
with
high
employment
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
they
appropriated
the
money
from
apparently
general
revenue
to
admit
the
extended
benefits.
it
was
not
state
unemployment
fund.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
it
came
up
to
65
weeks,
but
that
is
cut-off
now
because
of
the
on-off
indicator
that
they
have.
if
it
reaches
a
certain
percent
in
the
state
in
high
economic
unemployment
areas,
it
goes
back
on.
ohio
so
far
has
not
been..
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
yes,
but
that
is
an
unusual
case.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
26
weeks
is
the
normal.
under
the
tenth
amendment,
our
argument
is
that
since
the
social
security
act
does
not
decide
what
benefits
are
to
be
paid
is
left
to
the
state.
that
any
law
that
would
tell
us
what
to
do,
that
would
be
a
reserve
to
the
states
under
their
reserved
power,
police
power
and
general
welfare
would
be
a
violation
of
the
tenth
amendment.
the
coverage;
there
have
been
two
amendments
to
the
social
security
act.
the
1970
amendments
increased
the
coverage,
but
nothing
was
said
about
benefits.
it
was
just
that
state
and
political
subdivision
employees
would
be
covered.
certain
types
of
agricultural
workers
are
now
not
excluded
unless
they
are
actually
on
the
farm,
but
the
adjacent
peripheral
type
work
is
covered.
in
1976,
they
also
expanded
the
coverage,
but
that
neither
the
1970
nor
the
1976
amendments
had
anything
to
do
with
this
case.
it
is
coverage.
most
of
it
is
covered
by
federal
tax,
the
state
gets
credit
for
it
with
exception
to
the
government
employees.
we
question
whether
that
is
constitutional
under
this
court’s
recent
ruling
in
national
league
of
cities
of
those
accessory,
since
the
state
employees
in
the
political
subdivisions
are
exempt
from
fudo.
so
therefore,
the
state
gets
no
credit
for
that
and
i
would
expect
that
this
court
might
be
faced
with
that
challenge
one
of
these
days.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
got
about
three
areas
in
that.
a
recent
case
that
this
court
heard,
in
which
they
denied
cert,
was
kimbell.
in
the
kimbell
case,
i
believe
this
court
asked
the
solicitor
general
to
file
a
position
paper,
a
law
memorandum
paper
and
that
was
75-1452,
kimbell
v.
doing
business
as
foodway
first
incorporated.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
yes,
versus
employment
security
commission
of
state
in
new
mexico.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
the
issue
in
that
case
involved
the
labor
dispute,
but
it
is
not
the
same
as
ours,
but
i
am
pointing
it
out
because
the
solicitor
general
says,
“it
is
always
been
and
it
is
still
is
a
right
of
a
state
to
determine,
who
is
eligible,
to
what
extent
benefits
to
be
paid
and
what
disqualifications
you
are
going
to
have”.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
the
labor
department
attorneys
said
that
they
have
always
felt
that
there
is
no
position
paper
on
it,
they
have
never
written
one.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
never
written
any
regulation
on
it
because
it
is
all
the
states
have
just
automatically.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
well,
there
is
north
carolina
(voice
overlap)
and
ourselves,
but
there
are
various
variations
of
that.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
there
are
all
kinds
of
variations.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
well,
there
are
some
states
that
do
not
even
speak
about—they
just
say
you
are
just
qualified
if
you
are
involved
in
a
labor
dispute.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
they
do
not
even
go
in
to
fault,
no
fault
or
where
it
is
located
or
we
will
stop
it,
your
worker
or
anything,
it
just
absolutely
denied
under
a
labor
dispute.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
every
year.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
it
is
an
annual
approval,
it
has
been…
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
1974.
i
beg
your
pardon,
i
was
confused,
on
which
again
you
were
talking
about,
in
1963.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
right
after
the
abney
v.
ford
case,
what
happened?
we
are
always
disqualified
for
this
reason
and
the
ohio
court
spoke,
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court
have
always
did
held
their
statute
constitutional,
but
it
did
not
have
the
words
in
at
any
other
location
with
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary,
owned
or
operated
by
the
parent
company.
somebody
challenged
the
statute,
abney
challenged
the
statute
in
1963
and
they
got
into
the
word
construction
of
what
does
“establishment”
mean.
previous
to
that
day,
establishment
covered
multi-plants.
the
michigan
case
in
chrysler
that
was
just
decided
previous
to
that
held
that
they
would
go
to
a
strict
construction
on
their
word
establishment
and
they
also
had
the
same
problem
because
ford
had
multi-integrated
plants
to
produce
an
automobile
and
the
michigan
supreme
court
held
that
the
establishment
was
not
broad
enough
to
cover
another
plant.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
we
immediately
amended
the
laws.
so
the
legislator
whose
original
purpose
was
to
disqualify
these
people
when
it
was
turned
around
and
said,
“now
they
can
get
benefits,”
they
immediately
went
in
and
changed
the
law.
it
has
been
approved
since
1963
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
it
sure
has.
the
only
insight
that
we
can
get
as
far
as
at
least
what
members
of
congress
feel
about
this,
i
have
a
section
in
my
brief,
which
is
on
page
17,
not
the
reply
brief,
but
the
main
brief,
and
i
think
it
starts,
well
17
talks
about
“mr.
secretary,
you
have
talks
about
the
exhaustion
of
benefits,”
but
on
page
19,
mr.
weather
for
dunlop,
who
was
asked
the
question
regarding
involvement
with
states,
deferred
to
mr.
weather
for
it
and
he
said
that,
“we
have
got
to
provide
a
great
amount
of
influence
over
it
by
program
letters,
leadership
guidance
to
make
sure
that
the
state
does
develop
a
program
that
is
sound.”
that
is
about
the
only
involvement
they
get.
they
give
us
advise
of
our
fund
is
running
low.
my
time
is
up.
mr.
richard
a.
szilagyi
thank
you.
