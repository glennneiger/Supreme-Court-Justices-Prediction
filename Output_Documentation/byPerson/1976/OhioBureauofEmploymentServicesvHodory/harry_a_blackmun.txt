justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
first
case
comes
to
us
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
ohio.
the
appellee,
hodory,
was
an
employee
of
the
united
states
steel
corporation
at
its
youngstown
plant.
he
was
laid
off
when
that
plant
was
shut
down
due
to
a
reduction
in
the
fuel
supply
resulting
from
a
nationwide
strike
of
us
steels
miners
at
its
company
owned
coal
mines,
hodory
there
upon
applied
to
the
ohio
bureau
for
unemployment
benefits
under
the
state
statutes.
his
claim
was
disallowed
under
a
provision
that
disqualifies
a
worker
from
such
benefits
if
his
unemployment
is
due
a
labor
dispute
other
than
a
lockout
at
any
factory
owned
or
operated
by
the
employer.
hodory
then
filed
a
class
action
in
the
district
court
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
he
asserted
that
the
state
statute
conflicted
with
certain
provisions
of
the
federal
social
security
act
and
that
is
applied,
it
was
irrational
and
had
no
valid
public
purpose,
all
this
in
violation
of
the
do
process
and
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
district
court
agreed
within.
it
refused
to
abstain
and
held
that
the
statute
violated
these
constitutional
clauses.
we
reversed.
we
do
hold
that
abstention
is
not
required.
the
state
itself
has
submitted
the
constitutional
issue
for
this
court
and
principles
of
equity
and
comity
therefore,
do
not
require
that
we
refuse
ohio
the
immediate
adjudication
it
seeks,
neither
as
abstention
indicated
in
a
hope
that
the
statute
might
be
construed
by
the
state
courts
so
as
to
avoid
or
ameliorate
a
constitutional
issue.
we
further
hold
that
the
ohio
statute
is
not
in
conflict
with
or
preempted
by
the
social
security
act
or
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act
does
the
appellees
urge.
finally,
we
hold
that
the
statute
has
a
rational
relation
to
a
legitimate
state
interest
and
is
constitutional.
we
view
its
consequences
not
only
for
the
recipient
of
the
beneficiaries
or
the
benefits
but
also
for
the
contributors
to
the
compensation
fund
and
so
do
in,
we
conclude
that
the
need
for
limitation
of
a
liability
of
the
fund
is
a
legitimate
state
interest.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
