mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
good
morning
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
good
morning
mr.
justices,
mr.
szilagyi,
co-counsels
and
all
citizens.
briefly
stated,
we
think
this
ohio
statute
negates
the
whole
purpose
of
the
federal
unemployment
compensation
act
filed
in
1936
at
a
time
when
i
was
just
toddling
around
and
most
of
you
gentleman
understand
better
and
i
now
ask
you
to
try
to
recall
back
what
was
it
like
back
in
the
30s
and
remember
why
that
statute
and
us
member
of
the
jury
can
do
that,
you
do
not
have
to
forget
your
common
sense
as
we
say
to
jurors.
and,
with
all
due
deference
and
respect,
this
case
mr.
szilagyi
is
talking
about
and
the
state
has
talked
about,
administrative
procedure,
administrative
expertise
comes
through
in
the
presentation.
i
would
also
point
out
to
this
court
that
the
members
of
the
lower
three-judge
court,
particularly
the
honorable
judge
celebrezze.
i
was
an
assistant
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
ohio,
bureau
of
employment
services
before
his
elevation
to
hew
where
he
became
the
secretary
of
hew
in
the
kennedy
administration
and
he
was
in
the
position
to
be
knowledgeable
of
these
statutes
to
be
administrating
from
the
whole
united
states
not
just
ohio.
he
was
the
man
who
decided
this
case.
we
have
judicial
expertise
here.
judge
thomas
lambros
was
a
common
pleas
judge
before
he
was
elevated
to
the
bench
and
decided
many
unemployment
compensation
cases
and
that
appears
in
the
record.
and
the
court
knows
this
through
its
administration,
those
judges
and
those
courts
these
are
matters
that
you
can
take
judicial
notice
of
it
if
you
like.
briefly,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
there
are
few
what
we
would
call
politely
inaccuracies
in
the
statements
of
facts.
the
state
asserts
that
the
ohio
statute
as
passed
in
1936
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
ohio
amendment
which
we
are
attacking
in
1961
and
it
lived
until
1975,
a
period
of
14
years.
it
is
not
essentially
the
same.
prior
to
1961,
had
mr.
hodory
and
his
group
applied,
they
would
have
received
benefits.
in
1963,
there
was
only
one
other
state
in
ohio
that
excluded
under
this
circumstances
and
that
was
north
carolina
which
passed
this
severe
exclusion
in
1961.
up
to
that
point,
all
of
the
states
would
allow
benefits
at
this
point.
furthermore,
the
state
relies
upon
a
case
in
support
of
a
proposition
of
law
that
michigan
statutes
or
somewhat
like
ohio
statutes
characterizes
that
as
the
law
of
michigan.
well,
we
point
out
as
we
do
at
page
57
of
the
brief,
chrysler
v.
smith
297
michigan,
page
438
was
expressly
overruled
in
park
v.
appealed
board
of
michigan,
355
michigan
103,
and
that
appeal
appears
in
our
brief
and
that
case
is
not
good
law
for
anything.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
well,
the
attorney
general
says
no,
but
most
expressly
by
the
statute,
they
would.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
yes,
this
compensation
is
for
a
past
period
of
time
which
they
were
denied
benefits.
mr.
hodory
and
his
group
applied
in
november
1974,
and
the
case
is
still
in
the
administrative
proceedings
till
today.
it
has
not
got
to
the
first
level
step
here
and
mr.
hodory
went
to
the
counter
and
he
received
the
denial.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
it
began
to
be
deferred
by
the
state
after
the
three-judge
court
issued
their
decision
in…
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
there
was
nothing
to
preclude
ohio
from
going
ahead
with
this
case,
your
honor,
we
have
been
in
federal
court
and
other
state
courts,
and
in
state
courts,
and
they
have
gone
ahead
and
decided.
processed
the
case
right
through
the
administrative
procedure
without
holding
it
in
abeyance.
i
do
not
believe
ohio
is
holding
it
in
abeyance.
ohio
is
not
complying
with
“when
do.”
they
are
not
processing
claims
and
moving
them
along
and
the
department
of
labor
reports
as
they
over
see
ohio
show
this,
ohio
is
way
far
behind,
not
only
is
the
statute
unconstitutional,
but
they
are
so
slow.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
no,
but
we
find
that
this
case
is
not
like
the
turner
case
and
which
involved
the
pregnancy
disqualification,
the
turner
case
had
received
annual
approval
as
well.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
yes,
some
of
the
federal
officials
have,
particularly
congress.
congress
has
stated
and
as
we
pointed
out
in
the
brief
that
in
various
senate
and
congress
committees
on
the
purpose
of
the
statute
have
pointed
out
that
no
person
should
be
denied
unemployment
compensation
benefits
where
he
is
involuntary
unemployed
in
a
strike
in
which
he
participated
in
at
his
plant
is
going
on.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
well,
we
raised
the
statutory
grounds,
your
honor
and
we
argued
them
below
and
we
asked
the
court
to
address
themselves
and
they
did
not
feel
that
--
they
went
on
due
process
and
equal
protection.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
well,
certainly.
in
light
of
matt
v.
ohio
if
the
court
wanted
them
here,
we
believe
they
could
be
here
because
i
believe
in
--
if
remember
map
correctly,
there
were
issues
presented
to
this
court
back
in
1958
by
counsel
and
the
court
decided
that
on
grounds
other
than
where
argued
before
the
court.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
yes,
we
are
your
honor
that
is
why
we
plead
them
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
the
lower
court
felt
that
the
federal
unemployment
statue
enacted
in
1936
and
as
amended
did
not
completely
pre-empt
some
state
modification,
but
they
felt
that
the
modifications
made
here
by
ohio
were
not
too
severe
under
due
process
and
equal
protection.
but
we
urged
java
at
this
court,
we…
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
yes
we
are
and...
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
well,
at
page
30
of
the
brief
your
honor.
we
talk
about
the
history
and
provisions
of
the
labor
dispute
qualifications.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
in
title
xxvi
of
the
united
states
code,
section
3304
i
believe,
that
the
secretary
of
labor
is
only
to
fund
and
process
those
state’s
programs
that
are
proper
to
ensure
full
payment
of
benefits.
also,
we
rely
on
the
42
u.s.c.
sections
501,
which
is
303
of
the
act
and
that…
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
particular
statute
refers
to
“when
do”
that
the
secretary
should
only
approve
those
programs
under
which
will
it
ensure
the
full
payment
of
benefits
to
those
eligible,
“when
do”.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
yes,
and
the
other
section
is
26
u.s.c.
3304(a)(10).
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
proper,
right,
and
we
are
saying
this
is
not
proper.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
right
and
he
also
found
that
in
the
turner
case.
what
we
are
saying
is
the
java
case,
as
we
told
the
lower
court
and
as
we
argued,
did
not
primarily
or
specifically
deal
with
procedure
versus
substantive.
this
court
was
not
talking
about
the
standards
to
get
locked-in
on
this
category
as
mr.
marshall
points
out
in
margia
v.
massachusetts,
where
we
have
a
two
tier
approach
for
our
equal
protection
classifications.
we
feel
that
this
court
was
speaking
out
for
the
purpose,
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
unemployment
act
when
mr.
chief
justice
burger
said
that
those
involuntarily
unemployed.
mr.
chief
justice
burger
in
delivering
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
java
clearly
indicated
that
the
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting
the
unemployment
compensation
program
was
to
provide
a
substitute
for
wages
lost
during
a
period
of
unemployment
not
to
fault
of
the
employee,
402
u.s
130.
in
this
case,
we
are
saying
that
the
ohio
disqualification
bears
no
relationship
to
any
legitimate
state
purpose,
it
has
no
rationale
behind
it.
therefore,
it
must
fail
and
it
must
fail
on
constitutional
grounds,
and
it
must
fail
because
it
is
in
conflict
with
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
congressional
statute
as
passed
by
congress
in
title
xxvi.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
well,
number
one
your
honor,
the
statute
starts
out
in
ohio.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
on
the
page
26
in
the
appendix
orc
414129,
eligibility
and
qualification
for
benefits.
it
says
each
eligible
individual
shall
receive
benefits
as
compensation
for
loss
of
remuneration
due
to
involuntary
total
or
partial
unemployment.
well,
that
is
recognition
of
the
fundamental
purpose
of
congress.
fault
appears
no
less
than
eleven
times
in
the
ohio
statute.
we
talk
about
fault
in
indeed,
involuntariness
and
we
equate
that
with
fault
in
the
federal
statute.
it
appears
in
the
congressional
purpose.
it
appears
in
the
contestants
of
traditions
of
the
peoples
of
the
united
states,
in
anglo-saxon
countries
and
the
statute
was
adopted
from
the
english
statute
of
1911.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
yes,
that
would
be
the
broad
class.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
your
honor
we
treat
that
in
our
brief
and
briefly
stated
we
are
not
dealing
with
that,
but
to
be
answering
your
question,
quite
properly
and
politely;
we
would
indicate
that
no
benefits
for
strikers.
we
are
in
agreement
with
that,
we
feel
striking
is
involuntary...
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
well,
there
are
states
that
have
that
disqualification
and
they
have
an
escape
clause.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
yes,
we
would,
and
we
do
so,
on
our
brief.
we
feel
there
ought
to
be
an
escape
clause
and
it
does
not
take
much…
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
certainly
not.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
certainly,
not.
we
feel
that
fundamentally,
the
people
were
participating
in
the
strike,
if
they
are
supporting
it
in
some
fashion,
this
could
be
easily
discovered
by
the
state.
the
state
has
alternative
means
of
doing
this
when
the
people
come
up
to
the
counter
after
they
are
allowed
to
cross
the
line
which
says,
“thou
shalt
not
step
across,”
this
could
be
gotten
into
at
the
preliminary
stage.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
20
years
ago
i
worked
at
us
steel
as
a
foreman
there
and
when
we
terminated
people
and
they
still
do
it
today,
people
are
given
a
little
card,
they
handed
in
their
materials,
they
handed
in
their
equipment
and
they
were
checked
out.
the
reason
for
their
discharge
was
put
on
a
multi-copied
tear
apart.
they
gave
their
reason,
right
there
why
they
were
being
discharged
and
most
of
the
time
it
was
terminated
for
lack
of
work,
reduction
of
force.
so
there
is
no
burden
on
the
state
and
if
an
employee
takes
it
to
the
state
offices
and
they
rely
on
that
and
it
is
a
business
record
and
so
it
is
really
not
an
evidentially
problem
as
the
state
puts
forth.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
certainly.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
well,
the
farm
workers
and
the
other
people
that
you
mentioned,
they
are
not
in
the
eligible
class.
the
steel
workers
are.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
yes,
they
are
in
the
class.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
mr.
hodory,
worked
for
an
employer
who
was
a
steel
manufacturer
and
did
not
receive
--
us
steel,
he
would
have
been
paid.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
they
are
not
eligible
at
that
time,
your
honor.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
well,
going
in
to
it,
mr.
hodory
is
eligible
to
apply
for
benefits,
he
is
eligible
to
go
see...
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
well,
there
maybe
a
rationale
basis
for
one
week
waiting
period,
that
may
not
be
long
enough.
the
employer
may
issue
a
call
back.
there
maybe
rationale
basis
for
this,
i
have
no
problem
with
that.
but
to
exclude
people
who
are
involuntary
unemployed
through
no
fault
of
their
own,
once
they
are
in
the
class
where
the
employer
has
done
something,
this
statute
goes
to
what
the
employer
has
done.
this
employer
is
united
states
steel,
which
the
court
knows
is
vertically
integrated
from
the
mesabi
range,
from
over
in
europe
to
mines
in
west
virginia
and
to
kentucky,
which
we
are
talking
about.
this
employer
was
involved
in
a
labor
dispute.
mr.
hodory
and
his
groups
were
not
involved,
they
are
innocent
by
standers,
they
are
in
another
union,
some
are
probably
were
not
even
in
the
union
yet,
working
at
the
plant.
they
are
the
umw.
they
are
not
involved,
it
is
miles
away
and
they
are
being
excluded
for
something
not
that
they
have
not
done,
not
as
their
fault,
something
their
employer’s
fault,
something
that
their
employer
has
done,
their
employer
has
called
the
shot.
he
is
the
one
that
has
laid
them
off.
it
is
a
new
twist
in
the
law,
it
is
the
respondeat
inferior.
respond
for
something
your
employer
has
done
rather
than
respondeat
superior.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
no,
no
sir,
no
your
honor.
an
employee
can
walk
away,
he
can
terminate
the
employment.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
what
if
he
just
walks
out
the
door
and
says
i
will
see
you.
he
does
not
get
it
either.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
so
he
can
call
the
shot.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
no
sir.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
yes
sir
and
this
statute…
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
no,
i
would
not
answer
that,
but
this
statute
was
tailored
in
ohio
and
the
only
state
like
it
was
north
carolina.
if
this
court
rules
in
favor
of
ohio
in
this
case,
you
necessarily
overrule
51
other
jurisdictions,
the
other
states
and
the
district
of
columbian
and
puerto
rico.
they
have
to
be
all
wrong.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
yes.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
we
understand
and
our…
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
by
implication
i
certainly
and
the
ohio’s
new
statute
would
be
overruled.
it
would
be
granting
benefits.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
oh
yes
it
would,
because
basically
this
ohio
amendment
is
anti-labor
legislation.
it
cannot
be
interpreted
as
any
other
way.
it
is
a
tax
break
for
employers.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
i
am
not
using
the
word
anti-labor
advisedly,
it
is
just
a
short
hand
expression,
yes,
and
you
can
see
it
in
this
case.
you
will
notice
in
this
case
that
the
chamber
of
commerce
has
filed
brief
opposing
appellees.
us
steels
filed
brief
opposing
appellees.
republic
steel
as
filed
a
brief
opposing
appellees
and
they
talked
about
the
effect.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
i
think
the
court
is
aware
that
these
people
are
working
on
this
question
right
now,
in
this
and
a
lot
of
other
cases.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
no,
because
i
think
the
question
underlying
the
surface
here
is
--
the
question
is
whether
or
not
benefit
should
be
paid
to
strikers
and
that
case
is
the
dawson
howard
case,
which
is
awaiting
petition
for
cert
in
this
court
right
now
and
that
is
not
our
case.
we
are
not
dealing
with
strikers
and
there
is
a
lobbying
going
on
in
the
country
in
various
legislatures
and
in
this
case
there
is
lobbying
and
the
issue
that
comes
in
here
by
way
of
the
back
door
is
really
brought
in
by
the
employers
in
the
chambers
of
commerce
and
the
afl-cio,
because
what
they
are
talking
about
is
the
payment
of
unemployment
benefits
to
strikers
by
state
unemployment
compensation
funds.
in
new
york
where
the
dawson
howard
case,
which
is
awaiting
some
activity
by
this
court,
involves
a
situation
where
the
new
york
statute
allows
benefits
to
strikers
who
are
directly
participating
in
the
strike
at
the
site
after
a
seven-week
waiting
period.
and
the
cio
is
pushing
for
dawson
howard
all
over
the
united
states
without
fault
and
the
chamber
of
commerce
and
the
steel
companies
who
are
saying,
we
do
not
want
to
have
to
pay
benefits
for
people
who
are
striking
us
directly,
because
number
one,
it
violates
neutrality.
we
do
not
want
to
have
to
pay
the
benefits
to
people
who
are
striking
against
us,
and
they
are
directly
involved
in
that,
and
they
are
saying
that
these
would
be
subsidizing
a
labor
dispute.
as
far
as
mr.
hodory
and
his
group
is
concern
that
is
not
the
case
for
this
court.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
i
am
sorry.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
well,
in
this
particular
case
we
have
a
group
of
employees
who
are
denied
benefits
under
the
statute
that
sets
up
a
class
of
individuals
who
are
deemed
to
be
disqualified
from
receiving
benefits
where
there
participation
in
a
strike
has
not
been
shown?
there
is
no
real
substantial
state
purpose
for
the
passage
of
the
statute,
and
it
does
not
present
any
legitimate
interest
of
the
state,
it
furthers
no
substantial
interest
of
the
state.
the
arguments
put
forward
in
favor
of
this
are
one
that
it
destroys
the
physical
integrity
of
the
state.
if
you
allowed
this
people
to
collect
benefits,
it
would
overwhelm
the
states
unemployment
compensation
fund.
as
it
stands
now,
that
there
are
237
million.
in
this
case
we
are
talking,
according
to
the
state,
maybe
770,000.
that
is
not
going
to
deplete
the
fund
and
ohio
by
its
own
amendment
of
the
statute
has
recognized
this.
so
ohio
legislature
is
not
worrying
about
depleting
the
fund.
number
two;
we
talk
about
neutrality,
that
somehow
this
would
upset
the
employer-employee
bargaining
process
whereby,
if
benefits
are
paid
to
these
steel
workers
in
ohio
that
somehow
this
will
affect
the
outcome
of
the
mine
workers
strike
in
west
virginia
and
tennessee
and
as
the
district
court
shows,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
this.
it
has
not
been
shown
and
we
do
not
think
that
it
can
be
shown.
the
employer
could
care
less
at
this
point.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
we
are
saying,
yes
and
there
are
no
reason
to
discriminate
against
them
because
they
are
alike
all
the
other
people.
they
are
involuntarily
unemployed
through
no
fault
of
their
own
and
if
they
are
involuntarily
unemployed,
that
is
arbitrary
in
capricious,
and
if
it
is
arbitrary
in
capricious,
it
is
unconstitutional
and
they
ought
to
have
the
benefits.
mr.
t.
patrick
lordeon
we
are
talking
about
those
who
do
collect,
right
and
we
are
talking
about
the
fault,
the
group
that
the
unemployment
compensation
act
was
passed
in
1936.
it
was
passed
at
the
time
when
there
were
programs
set-up
under
social
security
act,
and
this
act
must
be
looked
at
as
a
total.
there
was
something
in
there
for
people
who
could
no
longer
work,
the
old
people.
there
were
something
in
a
social
security
as
we
know
it
today
and
it
had
been
amended
quite
a
bit,
there
was
something
in
there
for
those
involuntarily
unemployed
and
we
have
welfare
programs
and
they
are
all
something
different.
unemployment
is
regarded
as
receiving
something
as
dignity
and
as
justice
rehnquist
has
pointed
out
to
us
that
unemployment
is
an
earned
right.
it
is
not
based
on
need.
it
is
based
on
an
earned
right
of
the
employee
and
the
purpose
of
giving
this
money
is
so
that
he
could
maintain
his
dignity
and
go
out
and
look
for
a
job
and
to
provide
for
a
substitute
for
wages
while
he
is
looking
for
a
job.
we
agree
with
justice
rehnquist,
it
is
an
earned
right
and
we
think
anytime,
anyone
is
denied
unemployment
benefits
when
they
are
involuntarily
unemployed,
in
this
case,
that
is
an
invidious
discrimination.
it
subverts
the
whole
purpose
of
the
act.
it
is
just
tax
relief
for
employers.
thank
you.
