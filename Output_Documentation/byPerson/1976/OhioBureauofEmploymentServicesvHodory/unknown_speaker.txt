mr.
szilagyi,
is
it
clear
that
the
statute
in
this
case
does
prevent
any
unemployment
benefits
to
be
paid
to
the
respondents?
unknown
speaker
but
then,
the
claim
of
these
people
is
also
on
appeal,
by
then?
unknown
speaker
so,
it
is
not
clear
so
far
that
it
has
not
been
finally
determined
by
the
state
of
ohio
and
the
administrative
appeal
process
that
these
people
are
deprived
of
their
unemployment
benefits,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
and
their
claim
in
that
appeal
is
what,
that
the…?
unknown
speaker
well,
yes,
but
do
they
say
they
are
entitled
to
it
even
under
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
making
the
same
claim
on
that
state
proceeding
as
they
are,
as
they
prevailed
in
this
federal
court
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
administrative
proceedings,
it
was
my
understanding
that
they
are
claiming
that
even
assuming
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
they
are
entitled
to
benefits
under
the
statute
because
their
employer
could
have
gotten
its
coal
somewhere
else.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
the
new
policy
mr.
szilagyi?
unknown
speaker
which
is
set
to
work?
unknown
speaker
oh,
would
you
agree
to
their
remand,
you
would
not
agree
to
that.
unknown
speaker
but
this
statute
has
not
been
amended,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
decision
in
this
case
on
the
statutory
ground
or
on
the
conflict
ground
with
the
federal
statute?
unknown
speaker
what
is
this,
where
did
this
case
come
from?
unknown
speaker
was
the
conflict
with
the
federal
statute
alleged?
unknown
speaker
did
the
three-judge
court
decide
that?
unknown
speaker
had
there
any
complaint
made
about
it?
was
that
part
of
the
case
when
it
started
in
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
supremacy?
unknown
speaker
so
that
was
in
the
complaint?
unknown
speaker
but
did
they
abandon
that
supremacy
clause
argument?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
it
decided
or
not?
unknown
speaker
was
it
not
supposed
to
before
it
reached
the
equal
protection
or
due
process
clause?
unknown
speaker
well
i
understand
that,
but
how
about
a
conflict
with
the
federal
statute,
they
did
not
decide
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
object
to
that
or
not?
are
you
complaining
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can
raise
the
issue
of
the
conflict
to
the
federal
statute
in
the
1983
act?
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
there
is
just
no
federal
statute
that
is
relevant
to
it?
unknown
speaker
has
ohio
amended
his
law
now?
unknown
speaker
in
1975.
unknown
speaker
1977,
was
there
one
in
1975
too?
unknown
speaker
1975.
unknown
speaker
but
how
did
they
--
did
they
eliminated
the
disqualification?
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
employees
involved
in
this
case
would
not
have
been
disqualified?
unknown
speaker
the
one
that
i
just
read,
2141.
unknown
speaker
not
the
amended,
the
previous
to
the
amendment.
the
one
that
disqualifies
that
says
that
there
are
other
premises
located
in
this
or
any
other
state
and
owned
or
operated
by
the
employer,
the
functional
integrated
theory.
the
coal
mine
was
in
west
virginia
that
went
on
strike.
the
cleveland
plants
were
closed
down.
that
is
the
statute
that
the
court
decided
and
it
is
before
this
court.
unknown
speaker
the
same
statute
that
was
before
the
three-judge
district
court
in
arizona.
unknown
speaker
that
is
on
appeal
here
is
the
one
that
is
involved
in
the
state
administrative
proceedings
that
are
pending?
unknown
speaker
could
the
administrative
tribunal
apply
the
new
statute?
what
is
the
bar?
unknown
speaker
the
law
does
require
that
there
will
be
annual
approval?
unknown
speaker
by
the,
is
it
still
the
secretary
of
labor.
unknown
speaker
and
ohio’s
plan
has
the
annual
approval.
unknown
speaker
including
the
years
here
involved,
the
period
here
involved.
unknown
speaker
and
in
every
state
has
a
cut-off
time.
you
are
qualified
only
for
a
certain
number
of
weeks.
unknown
speaker
but
every
single
state
has
a...
unknown
speaker
duration.
unknown
speaker
the
limitation.
unknown
speaker
for
any
determinate
period?
unknown
speaker
but
even
that,
there
is
a
terminal
point
of
65
weeks
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
unknown
speaker
could
you
tell
me
if
the
federal
officials
have
specifically
addressed
themselves
to
whether
or
not
the
ohio
type
of
disqualification
is
contrary
to
the
federal
statute
or
the
federal
regulation?
unknown
speaker
the
75-1452?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
is
that
as
close
you
can
come
to
finding
something
addressed
to
this
specific
disqualification?
unknown
speaker
they
have
never
issued
a
regulation
or.
unknown
speaker
but
they
are
only,
were
there
not,
how
many
states
were
there
with
your
disqualification,
only
two,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
well
i
understand,
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
not
at
other
plants?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
does
your
plan
--
did
you
say
your
plan
had
to
receive
federal
approval?
unknown
speaker
every
year,
and
it
has?
unknown
speaker
and
when
did
you
amend
your
plan
to
put
in
this
disqualification,
1960s?
unknown
speaker
1963.
unknown
speaker
so
ohio
then
amended
its
laws?
unknown
speaker
your
law
has
been
approved
every
year
since
1963.
unknown
speaker
would
these
employees
get
compensation
today
in
ohio?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
let
us
assume
they
would,
what
is
at
issue
in
this
case,
compensation
for
a
past
period?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
the
administrative
proceeding
being
deferred
pending
resolution
of
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
maybe
you
would
have
had
a
decision
by
now,
if
you
have
not
brought
the
three-judge
court
case?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
disagree,
do
you
that
the
ohio
plan
has
received
annual
approval
since
1963?
unknown
speaker
had
the
federal
official
addressed
themselves
to
this
particular
exclusion
or
not?
unknown
speaker
this
case
was
decided
on
statutory
grounds.
unknown
speaker
well
are
they
before
us?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
familiar
with
the
normal
rule
that
the
courts
address
themselves
to
statutory
ground
for
its…
unknown
speaker
and
that
you
do
not
get
to
the
constitutional
when
it
would
be
pass
up
to
statutory,
and
this
court
passed
up
statutory
and
went
to
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
argue
the
constitutional
point
here,
the
one
that
the
court
decided?
unknown
speaker
before
you
moved
that,
in
answer
to
my
brother
white
you
said
yes
the
federal
officials
have
spoken,
particularly
the
congress
has
spoken
and
you
said
that
is
in
your
brief.
what
part
of
your
brief,
where
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
language
of
the
federal
statute
upon
which
you
rely?
as
you
pointed
out
in
your
complaint,
you
allege
that
this
was
impermissible
under
the
federal
statutory
law
and
what
provision
of
federal
statutory
law
do
you
rely
upon?
unknown
speaker
that
is
on
page
10
of
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
that
was,
what
was
relied
upon
in
the
java
case?
unknown
speaker
that
uses
the
word
proper.
unknown
speaker
although
the
secretary
of
labor
has
found
that
it
is.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lordeon,
in
your
constitutional
argument
on
which
you
rely
on
the
equal
protection
clause,
what
are
the
classifications
that
you
say
that
statue
makes
that
are
improper.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
your
classification
then
between
those
involuntary
unemployed
and
those
not
involuntary
unemployed?
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
do
about
a
case
involving
only
one
plant
in
which
say
the
people
who
do
run
the
heating
the
broiler
plant
or
something
like
that
go
on
strike
and
every
one
else
has
to
stay
home.
could
the
state
deny
unemployment
compensation
to
people
working
in
the
same
plant
where
the
strike
occurred,
but
who
have
no
control
over
their
inability
at
work?
unknown
speaker
involuntary
does
not
relate
to
strike.
my
question
relates
to
other
employees
in
one
plant
where
a
small
number
of
employees
are
able
closedown
the
entire
plant.
unknown
speaker
my
question
is
do
you
contend
that
disqualification
as
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
but
you
really
do
not
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
gold
mines
are
on
the
other
state?
unknown
speaker
the
mere
fact
that
it
is
involuntary.
unknown
speaker
except,
going
back
to
what
you
told
to
my
brother
stevens
was
your
basic
equal
protection
claim,
i.e
that
the
distinction
between
voluntary
unemployed
and
involuntary
unemployed.
every
state
statute
is
shown
full
of
provisions
that
deny
to
involuntarily
unemployed
people
unemployment
compensation.
for
example,
everybody
after
his
26
weeks
runs
out
or
whatever
the
number
of
weeks
is,
who
remains
involuntary
unemployed
no
longer
gets
unemployment
benefits.
just
to
take
one
example,
everybody,
there
is
a
waiting
period
in
every
states,
is
there
not?
unknown
speaker
and
during
that
period,
he
is
involuntarily
unemployed
and
does
not
get
benefits.
all
of
the
exempt
employees,
the
agricultural
workers,
the
domestic
workers
and
all
those
people
are
involuntarily
unemployed
and
they
do
not
get
benefits.
so,
that
distinction
just
does
not,
unless
you
say
that
all
of
those
provisions
and
i
have
only
mentioned
a
few
illustrative
examples,
all
of
those
provisions
are
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
these
people.
unknown
speaker
and
by
that
statute,
these
people
are
not
either?
unknown
speaker
we
can
accept
that
decision,
but
how
about
the
waiting
period
or
how
about
the
period
after
the
26
weeks,
those
are
all
matters
of
state
law.
unknown
speaker
neither
are
these
people
as
a
matter
of
state
law
that
is
the
point.
unknown
speaker
anybody
is
eligible
to
apply;
i
am
eligible
to
go
down
there
to
apply.
i
hope
i
would
be
turn
down
very
promptly.
unknown
speaker
in
every
case
by
definition,
it
is
the
employer
who
has
terminated
the
employment,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
he
does
not
get
it
if
he
is...
unknown
speaker
on
strike.
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
then
he
is
not
eligible,
is
he?
unknown
speaker
so
eligibility
in
almost
every
case
at
least,
depends
upon
the
employer’s
action
in
terminating
the
employment.
unknown
speaker
so
that
surely
is
not
a
constitutional
distinction.
you
are
pointing
out
that
in
this
case,
it
was
the
employer
who
terminated
the
employment.
my
question
is
that
not
true
in
every
case?
unknown
speaker
whether
this
is
constitutionally
tolerable?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
whether
the
other
states
have
violated
the
constitution
by
not
having
this
same
law.
the
question
in
this
case
is,
does
this
statute
constitutionally
tolerable?
unknown
speaker
but
you
just
submitted
that
if
we
have
decided
against
you
in
this
case,
we
would
invalidate
the
laws
of
49
other
states
that
is
certainly
not
true,
you
do
not
mean
that,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
i
just
cannot
let
you
say
that.
what
you
are
saying
mr.
lordeon,
is
that
those
statutes
would
not
be
constitutionally
required.
but
if
we
hold
this
statute
is
permissible,
it
does
no
affect
whatsoever
on
those
statutes.
the
legislature
can
still
have
the
statute
they
now
have.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
anything
that
we
hold
the
constitution
permits
will
be
adopted
because
ohio
is
basically
anti-labor
and
all
its
policies
are
anti-labor,
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
not
suggesting
they
make
the
policy
for
the
state
of
ohio,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
and
the
afl-cio
filed
a
brief
and
did
not
agree
with
you
either.
unknown
speaker
have
you
finished
your
equal
and
protection
argument
because
i
have
not
called
it
yet.
unknown
speaker
your
equal
protection
argument,
which
is
what
the
court
decided?
have
you
finished
discussing
that
because
i
do
not
understand
your
position?
unknown
speaker
your
point
is
this
narrow
class
is
different
from
all
the
others
who
get
unemployment,
is
that
your
inequality?
unknown
speaker
what
about
all
of
the
others
that
they
do
not
allow
to
collect
unemployment,
you
are
not
talking
about
those.
you
are
talking
about
those
who
do
collect.
