justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
not
suggesting
that
that
alone
would
exclude
an
in-court
identification.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
saying
that
testimony
about
the
out-of-court
identification
should
have
been
excluded
because,
simply
because
it
was
impermissibly
suggested?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
don’t
say
that
the
in-court
identification
is
automatically
excluded.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
along
with
the
out-of-court
identification.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
they
question
the
credibility,
the
believability
of
the
witness?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
the
answer
yes
or
no?
they
did,
didn’t
they
discounted
his
credibility?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
we
never
solved
that
the
witness
did
object
--
the
trial
judge
did
not?
was
there
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
it’s
all
of
the
--
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
were
operating
on
a
court
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
state
may
retry
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
sounds
to
me
like
judge
friendly
on
the
second
circuit
held
that
this
particular
policeman’s
testimony
would
not
be
received.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
isn’t
that
--
wouldn’t
it
be
--
wouldn’t
the
admissibility
of
the
out-of-court
identification
be
critical
in
a
lot
of
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
sense
that
without
the
pretrial
identification,
and
without
it’s
being
admissible,
the
officer
might
have
a
real
problem
in
identifying
in
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
not
only
that
but
having
dealt
with
--
having
seen
an
awful
lot
of
people?
