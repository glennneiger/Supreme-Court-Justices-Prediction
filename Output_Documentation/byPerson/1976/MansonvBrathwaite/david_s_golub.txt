mr.
david
s.
golub
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
the
paramount
in
undisputed
issue,
the
fact
in
this
case
is
that
the
identification
testimony
that
served
as
the
sole
basis
for
respondent
braithwaite’s
conviction
was
derived
from
what
has
been
conceded
by
the
state
and
what
has
been
found
by
every
court
that’s
reviewed
this
case
is
been
impermissibly
suggested
procedure
that
was
totally
unnecessary
under
the
facts
of
this
case
and
those
circumstances.
mr.
david
s.
golub
no,
we
are
not,
your
honor.
we
recognized
that
there
is
an
independent
basis
test
that
would
still
be
applicable
to
the
in-court
identification.
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
we
do
say
that
--
we
are
also
saying,
and
i
think
judge
friendly
held
the
in-court
identification
also
should
have
been
excluded.
his
opinion
applies
to
both
the
out-of-court
and
the
in-court.
mr.
david
s.
golub
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
there
is,
in
addition,
an
additional
fact
for
the
second
in-court
identification
that
wouldn’t
be
applicable
to
the
out-of-court
show-up.
mr.
david
s.
golub
no,
we
don’t.
mr.
david
s.
golub
no,
we
don’t
say
that
mr.
justice.
we
take
the
facts,
your
honors,
as
judge
friendly
found
them
in
the
court
of
appeals.
that
was
a
very
brief
encounter.
it
took
place
in
a
dimly
lit
hallway
at
sunset,
there
were
no
electric
lights
in
the
hallway
or
in
the
apartment,
the
door
to
the
apartment
was
open
only
12
to
18
inches,
and
this
is
all
glover’s
testimony,
the
agent’s
testimony.
there
were
two
people
in
the
doorway;
the
door
was
closed
most
of
the
time,
while
the
heroin
was
being
prepared
in
the
apartment.
the
officers
admitted
they
made
at
least
one
mistake
in
the
case.
they
went
to
the
wrong
apartment;
they
were
trying
to
buy
drugs
from
a
different
person.
mr.
david
s.
golub
your
honor,
it
is
true
that
there
was
no
contemporaneous
objection
at
the
time
of
trial.
i
think
it’s
significant
that
in
proceeding
in
the
district
court,
the
state
felt
that
the
trial
transcript
was
sufficient
to
establish
the
evidentiary
basis
for
the
in-court
and
out-of-court
identification.
mr.
david
s.
golub
we
did
too,
as
the
memorandum
of
opinion
from
judge
blumenfeld
indicates.
he
asked
us
whether
either
side
wanted
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
both
sides
agreed
that
it
wasn’t
necessary.
i
might
also
point
out,
your
honors,
that
judge
blumenfeld
invited
briefs
on
the
subject
of
the
contemporaneous
objection,
absence
of
the
contemporaneous
objection.
the
state
chose
not
to
file
a
brief,
the
state
chose
not
to
raise
the
issue
in
its
pleadings.
mr.
david
s.
golub
yes,
he
was
asking
for
in-court
briefs,
i
think,
one
whether
or
not
fair
to
object
precluded
habeas
corpus
relief.
i
think,
it’s
important
to
know
that
i
don’t
think
it
does
preclude
habeas
corpus
relief,
i
don’t
think
the
state
has
raised
it.
i
don’t
think
it’s
conceivable
that
it
could
have
been
a
deliberate
bypass
for
tactical
reasons
even
under
the
recent
standards
that
have
come
forth
in
the
courts
cases
last
term.
there
is
certainly
as
actual
prejudice
to
the
defendants
in
the
case
shown
here
under
francis
versus
henderson.
and
furthermore,
i
think
that
under
the
principle
of
warden
versus
hayden,
we
might
have
argued
in
the
district
court,
had
the
state
raised
it
that
there
was
--
this
was
plain
error
and
that’s
the
basis
apparently
on
which
this
connecticut
supreme
court
reviewed
it.
so
for
all
those
reasons
in
response
to
the
subject
of
the
absence
of
contemporaneous
objection.
mr.
david
s.
golub
no,
that’s
not
what
we
were
saying,
your
honor.
mr.
david
s.
golub
we
are
saying
that
there
are
two
issues
in
this
case
and
two
standards
that
could
be
applied
in
this
case:
one
would
be
the
totality
test
which
judge
friendly
applied
in
the
alternative;
the
other
would
be
the
strict
rule
of
exclusion
of
the
evidence
that
judge
friendly
also
felt
was
applicable.
we
feel,
and
we
feel
that
under
the
case
law
and
under
the
constitution,
a
strict
rule
of
exclusion
of
evidence
derive
from
an
unnecessarily
suggestive
identification
procedure
is
one
that
applies
to
the
out-of-court
identification.
we
feel
in
this
case,
even
more
so,
that
whether
or
not
that
test
is
applied,
even
if
the
totality
test
is
applied,
that
judge
friendly
was
certainly
correct
in
applying
the
test
as
he
did
in
this
case
and
coming
out
with
the
conclusion
that
a
substantial
likelihood
of
misidentification
resulted
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
we
do
want
it,
your
honor,
but
we
don’t
think
it’s
necessary
for
the
court
to
reach
it
to
affirm
the
opinion
below.
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
am
sorry,
i
couldn’t
hear
you.
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
we
feel
on
the
totality
test,
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
feel
that
in
view
of
the
brief
nature
of
the
encounter,
and
we
agree
with
the
question
that
was
posed
by
mr.
justice
stevens
about
the
length
of
time
that
was
involved.
the
conversion,
we
think,
was
the
total
amount
of
time.
the
door
was
closed
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
we
read
it
as
being
no
more
than
a
minute.
we
read
it
as
being
very
momentary.
there
was
a
--
on
page
30
of
the
transcript,
glover
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
i
don’t
think
--
i
think,
your
honor,
it
would
depend
on
each
individual
person.
it
might
be
that
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
don’t
know,
your
honor,
and
i
don’t
think
judges
can
tell
you
that.
mr.
david
s.
golub
it
might
be
under,
for
some
people
but
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
the
both
courts
below
found
that
it
was
no
more
than
one
or
two,
three
minutes.
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
might
point
out
that
with
respect
to
the
argument
about
the
trained
police
officer,
we
have
an
individual
who
went
to
the
wrong
apartment,
we
have
an
individual
who
was
observing
the
seller
without
the
benefit
of
electric
lights
at
the
time
of
sunset,
we
have
an
individual
whose
identification
was
disputed
by
the
other
witness
present,
we
have
an
individual
who
was
subjected
to
a
very
suggestive
photographic
confrontation,
but
moreover,
was
subject
to
the
suggestiveness
of
his
superior
officer
saying,
“i
know
who
it
is.
i
know
it’s
brathwaite.”
we
have
an
individual
who
--
no
matter
how
certain
he
may
have
been
felt
necessary
to
look
at
the
picture
again
before
the
day
of
trial
when
he
was
to
make
an
in-court
identification.
so
we
have
to
concede,
and
i
think
that
it
is
--
that
he
is
a
police
officer,
but
i
don’t
think
there
is
any
reason
to
exempt
a
police
officer
from
the
scrutiny
that
we
would
give
to
other
witnesses.
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
none
as
i
read
the
facts,
your
honor.
what
we
had
in
this
case
was
d’onofrio
saying,
“i
recognized
the
description
that
you
have
given
me,
it’s
brathwaite.”
and
he
apparently
recognized
it
because
he
had
seen
brathwaite
in
the
area
and
there
is
no
question
that
brathwaite
visited
that
apartment.
he
was
a
heavyset
black
male,
your
honor.
we
contend
that
what
d’onofrio
recognized
was
a
heavyset
black
male.
it
could
have
been
any
number
of
heavyset
black
males
in
the
apartment
and
the
fact
that
it
was
three
months
after
the
incident,
when
brathwaite
was
arrested;
the
fact
that
it
was
even
two
weeks
or
three
weeks
after
the
lab
report
came
back,
and
i
might
point
out
that
there
was
a
lay-up
analysis
done
on
the
street
at
the
day
of
the
alleged
sale.
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
am
sorry.
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
i
think
they
are
two
separate
questions.
i
know
that
there
have
been
courts
that
have,
appellate
reviewing
courts
have
looked
to
other
indicia
of
guilt
or
innocence
in
their
appellate
review.
i
think
that
i
would
disagree
with
those
courts
that
didn’t
and
i
would
say
that
that
is
an
independent
issue.
in
addition,
your
honors,
i
would
say
there
is
a
threshold
question
here
of
whether
or
not
this
court
is
going
to
sit
as
a
reviewing
court
for
factual
decisions
made
by
courts
of
appeals
when
the
standard
of
review
is
not
in
question.
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
it
is;
they
did
do
that,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
there
is
a
different
standard
for
review
in
this
court.
in
neil
versus
biggers,
this
court
did
indicate
that
it
would
review
the
facts.
it
did
review
the
facts
but
in
that
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
no,
your
honor,
i
don’t
think
it
is,
but
i
think
that
this
court
certainly
does
not
want
to
be
faced
with
reviewing
every
identification
case
that
comes
from
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
factual
basis.
mr.
david
s.
golub
you
mean
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
i
don’t
think
they
did
undertook
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
think,
what
he
indicated
in
the
opinion,
your
honor,
was
that
glover’s
incentive,
either
to
make
an
identification,
either
consciously
or
sub-consciously,
could
not
be
ruled
out.
i
mean,
he
had
expended
government
and
state
funds,
he
had
initiated
an
investigation,
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
going
to
the
wrong
apartment,
and
now
when
his
superior
officer
came
and
said,
“is
this
the
man?”
i
think
judge
friendly
felt
he
had
an
incentive
to
make
an
identification.
i
think
that
judge
friendly’s
--
i
don’t
think
he
was
questioning
a
credibility
of
the
witnesses
so
much
is
pointing
out
that
there
was
a
possible
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
i
think
the
findings
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
think,
there
is
no
--
there
no
factual
findings
were
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
it
was
simply
a
question
of
applying
the
law
to
the
facts
as
this
court
did
in
neil
versus
biggers,
but
i
think
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
yes.
well,
i
think
so,
but
i
think
the
difference
from
the
court’s
point
of
view,
from
neil
versus
biggers
in
this
case
is
that
in
neil
versus
biggers
there
was
the
further
argument
over
dissent
that
there
was
a
--
the
role
of
law
was
incorrectly
applied
in
the
court
of
appeals.
in
this
case,
on
the
totality
test,
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
rule
of
law
was
accurately
applied.
as
a
rule
of
law,
there
is
a
question
of
--
that
the
state
has
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
--
the
final
determination
was
correct
but
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
think
both
courts
applied
the
totality
test.
they
reached
different
conclusions
and
we
feel
that’s
partly
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
think
the
facts
are
the
same
in
both
courts,
your
honor.
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
would
say,
follow
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
david
s.
golub
no,
i
think
the
only
difference
is
that
the
district
court
said
--
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
there
might
be
an
incentive
to
--
there
might
be
a
reason
or
there
might
be
incentive
for
him
to
make
an
identification.
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
they
just
--
i
think,
they
countered
the
fact
that
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
suppose
the
answer
is
yes.
i
am
reluctant
to
give
that
answer
not
because
i
am
avoiding
the
question
but
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
he
inferred
a
potential
bias
and
i
think
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
judge
blumenfeld
did
not
do
that
and
i
think
that’s
one
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
there
was
no
hearing
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
david
s.
golub
on
the
same
transcript,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
s.
golub
the
district,
yes
--
he
did
not
look
to
glover’s
motives.
mr.
david
s.
golub
there
was
no
cross-examination
of
glover
that
went
to
this
issue.
in
fact,
the
cross-examination
of
glover
was
very
limited
in
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
i
think
the
only
thing
that
judge
friendly
found
was
that
he
couldn’t
be
presumed
to
be
accurate,
simply
because
he
was
a
trained
police
officer.
i
don’t
think
he
is
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
don’t
--
i
think,
he
noted
the
contrary.
the
contrary
might
be
true
and
might
be
possible.
mr.
david
s.
golub
he
found
that
the
testimony
--
there
was
a
substantial
likelihood
of
misidentification
from
the
procedures
employed
and
i
might
point
out
that
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
i
don’t
think
it’s
necessary
to
say,
it’s
a
total
rejection.
i
think
it
indicates
that
he
felt
that
there
was
too
higher
risk
of
misidentification
under
the
procedures
employed.
it
might
be
that
it’s
a
--
and
we,
in
fact,
intended
that
one
of
the
problems
with
the
totality
test
is
that
it’s
a
very
fine
line
in
many
instances.
i
don’t
know
how
long
it
would
take
mr.
justice
marshall
to
identify
me.
i
don’t
know
what
it
means
that
he
--
that
a
police
officer
on
the
street
has
made
a
mistake
and
wants
to
correct
it.
and
when
we
try
to
inquire
into
all
these
uncertain
areas
of
psychology,
when
judges
try
to
inquire
into
that,
the
result
is
one
that
is
susceptible
of
many
different
resolutions.
mr.
david
s.
golub
we
agreed
to
go
on
the
trial
transcript.
mr.
david
s.
golub
yes.
mr.
david
s.
golub
it
is,
it’s
part
of
the
record.
it
was
not
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
it
was
not
--
it’s
in
the
appendix.
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
i
think
the
burden
is
on
us
to
show
that
there
was
unnecessary
suggestiveness,
and
i
think
once
we
have
met
that
burden,
which
we
did,
that
the
burden
then
shifts
to
the
state
to
show
that
there
was
no
substantial
likelihood
of
misidentification.
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
i
don’t
think
it
is
explicitly
stated
in
a
case,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
that’s
the
rationale
of
the
identification
law
cases.
it’s
not
in
neil
versus
biggers.
we
think
that
--
and
i
think
it’s
not
in
neil
versus
biggers
because
that
was
an
opinion
where
the
test
was
framed
to
deal
with
pre-stovall
identifications
but
it
certainly
is
in
simmons
and
it
certainly
is
in
the
other,
the
right
to
counsel
identification
law
cases.
the
burden
is
put
on
the
state
or
the
government
to
show
that
there
was
no
substantial
likelihood
of
misidentification.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
strict
rule
of
exclusion
that
judge
friendly
and
the
unanimous
panel
of
the
second
circuit
held
was
applicable
to
this
case.
i
disagree,
i
suppose
personally
with
the
comments
of
my
brother,
the
need
for
deterrence.
i
think
judge
friendly
in
the
panel
and
other
judges,
all
the
commentators,
and
then
many
of
them
cited
in
the
brief
also
disagree
that
--
they
feel
there
is
a
need
for
deterrence.
there
is
a
need
for
deterrent
rule.
the
facts
of
this
case
indicate
the
need
for
the
deterrent
rule.
simmons
in
1968
made
it
clear
that
the
use
of
one
photograph
was
impermissible,
lower
courts
stridently
condemned
the
use
of
one
photograph
and
in
this
case
we
have
a
procedure
where
not
only
was
it
used
but
one
of
the
officers,
d’onofrio,
said
that
it
was
not
even
an
unusual
practice.
we
think
that
the
rule
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
on
the
basis
of
my
experience
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
this
is
a
limited
branch
of
the
connecticut
state
police
department.
it’s
the
regional
crime
squads
who
are
engaged
in
doing
this
kind
of
undercover
buying
of
drugs.
it
is
my
understanding
of
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
it’s
my
understanding
of
their
normal
practice,
that
they
make
the
purchase
and
then
go
back
and
look
at
only
one
mugshot.
for
no
reason,
other
than,
that’s
the
standard
procedure.
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
they
have
a
list
--
they
have
a
book
of
pictures
in
the
one
of
the
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
they
pulled
a
picture
out
of
the
book,
your
honor,
and
they
will
then
bring
it
over
as
mr.
d’onofrio
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
they
are
trained
but
they
are
still
subject
to
the
same
significance
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
there
are
many
people
who
might
look
like
that,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
david
s.
golub
[laughter]
yes,
your
honor.
what
i
seriously
feel
is
wrong
with
that
is
there
is
no
reason
why
that
can’t
be
done
by
means
of
a
photographic
spread.
there
is
no
reason
to
ensure
the
accuracy
of
the
identification,
even
if
it’s
by
a
police
officer,
that
it
can’t
be
done
in
six
or
ten
photographs.
the
use
of
one
photograph
is
ensuring
that
the
identification
will
be
made
of
the
picked
person
in
the
photograph
and
this
is
a
very
good
case
of
it
because
glover
had
no
prior
contact
with
brathwaite,
glover
didn’t
know
who
it
was,
d’onofrio
said
it’s
brathwaite,
d’onofrio
showed
glover
the
picture
or
left
the
picture
for
glover
to
see.
mr.
david
s.
golub
it’s
a
description,
your
honor,
of
a
heavyset
black
man
with
high
cheek
bones.
there
is
no
showing,
there
is
nothing
of
age,
there
is
nothing
of
facial
characteristics
in
this
testimony
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
there
is
nothing
about--
mr.
david
s.
golub
the
record
--
the
transcript
seems
to
indicate
that
d’onofrio
had
seen
brathwaite
in
the
area
and
that’s
as
far
as
it
goes.
mr.
david
s.
golub
yeah.
mr.
david
s.
golub
no,
there
is
no
evidence
--
there
is
no
testimony
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
that.
with
respect
to
the
adoption
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
yes.
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
think
that
is
a
fair
inference.
he
recognized
from
the
description,
a
heavyset
black
male
that
he
had
seen
in
the
area
and
secured
a
picture
of
that
and
might
point
out
the
picture
as
a
mugshot
and
doesn’t
have
anything
from
the
neck
down
and
so
it’s
not
a
full
photo
of
the
individual
that
the
description
had
been
given
of.
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
a
strict
rule
of
exclusion
is
wanted
in
this
case,
we
have
argued
in
the
brief
that
there
is
a
constitutional
basis
for
the
rule,
and
i
think
we
are
also
aware
that
several
members
of
this
court
have
indicated
that
there
is
some
doubt
in
their
minds
about
whether
a
constitutional
basis
either
in
the
fifth
amendment
right
to
a
fair
trial
exists.
we
feel,
we
don’t
retreat
from
the
position
we
took
in
the
brief,
as
to
the
fact
that
the
identification
law
cases
gilbert
and
stovall,
indicate
that
there
is
a
right
to
--
that
the
right
to
a
fair
trial
would
apply
and
warrant
a
deterrent
exclusionary
rule.
but
we
feel,
in
addition,
that
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
dealing
with
the
development
of
the
standards
under
which
a
deterrent
rule
is
warranted.
i
am
talking
about
decisions
such
as
michigan
versus
tucker,
calandra,
brown
versus
illinois,
and
cases
such
as
those
indicate
that
there
are
certain
guidelines
that
this
court
feels
are
applicable
when
creation
of
deterrent
rule
is
considered.
and
in
michigan
versus
tucker,
the
court
indicated
that
even
when
there
is
no
constitutional
basis
for
the
rule,
that
a
deterrent
rule
can
be
warranted
for
prophylactic
rules
designed
to
ensure
constitutional
rights.
of
course,
in
michigan
versus
tucker,
it
was
the
miranda
rule
that
was
--
the
fruits
of
the
miranda
rule
that
were
an
issue,
but
the
point
in
michigan
versus
tucker
and
the
point
in
all
of
these
cases,
is
the
court
has
been
formulating
standards
by
which
a
deterrent
rule
can
be
warranted,
and
we
feel
that
under
the
standards
announced
in
those
cases,
that
the
strict
rule
of
exclusion
suggested
and
adopted
by
the
second
circuit
is
fully
amended.
and
i
would
like
very
quickly
to
go
over
some
of
the
principles
that
we
feel
these
prior
cases
have
indicated.
there
is
a
concern
in
the
prior
cases
with
whether
or
not
the
conduct
that’s
being
deterred
can
in
fact
be
deterred.
one
of
the
criticisms
with
the
fourth
amendment
rule
is
that
it
applies
to
searches
and
seizures
which
are
made
in
good
faith.
by
contrast,
in
this
particular
instance,
we
are
dealing
with
the
rule
that
applies
only
to
unnecessary
photographic
procedures.
procedures
that
are
willful
or
negligent,
it
falls
within
the
language
of
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
mthank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
as
i
was
saying
before
the
lunch
recess,
i
think
that
if
we
look
to
the
cases
of
this
court
in
recent
terms,
dealing
with
development
of
exclusionary
rules
for
deterrent
purposes,
they
provide
guidelines
which
can
be
applied
to
this
case
and
which
mandate
creation
of
the
rule
that
the
second
circuit
adopted.
as
i
mentioned
before,
this
rule,
the
strict
rule
of
exclusion
of
unnecessarily
suggestive
identification
evidence
deals
only
with
evidence
that
can
and
should
be
deterred;
because
the
procedure
was
unnecessary,
it
is
either
willful
and
negligent,
it
falls
within
the
definitions
of
all
the
cases
that
deal
with
the
development
of
these
rules,
as
conduct
that
is,
of
which
the
officers
have
knowledge
is
improper
or
are
properly
chargeable
with
knowledge.
second
of
all,
i
think
it’s
clear
that
this
is
a
rule
that
will
have
impact,
it’s
a
rule
that
will
aim
directly
at
the
conduct
of
the
officers.
they
will
understand
under
what
circumstances
their
conduct
was
permissible,
under
what
circumstances
their
conduct
was
not
permissible.
it
avoids
the
second
step
of
the
analysis
which
gets
into
the
particular
individual,
who
made
the
identification,
the
witness
involved,
the
officer
may
not
offend
and
under
present
law,
understand
that
it’s
that
--
it’s
the
witness’s
length
of
observation
or
the
witness’s
memory
that
makes
an
identification
survive.
under
the
strict
rule
of
exclusion,
impact
on
the
officers
will
be
clear.
if
they
use
a
suggestive
means,
they
will
understand
that
that
means,
is
why
the
--
is
result
of
that
procedure
that
the
evidence
was
excluded.
thirdly,
it’s
also
clear
that
there
really
is
no
other
remedy
right
now
for
the
victim
of
this
kind
of
procedure.
if
there
is
no
constitutional
basis
for
the
procedure,
if
there
is
no
constitutional
violation
that
occurs
when
a
photographic
show-up
is
employed,
certainly
there
is
no
remedy
under
any
kind
of
civil
rights
action
or
any
kind
of
tort
theory.
this
court
has
held
only
recently
that
the
prosecutors
are
immune
from
suit,
for
something
like
this
i
would
think,
it
would
clearly
fall
under
the
recent
decision.
mr.
david
s.
golub
well
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
i
think
very
often
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
excuse
me.
i
think
very
often
the
prosecutor
himself
engages
in
an
identification
procedure.
in
this
case,
for
example,
on
the
day
of
the
trial,
the
prosecutor
did
show
the
photograph
to
agent
glover
again.
so
a
prosecutor
may
himself
become
involved
in
it.
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
think,
your
honor,
there
was
no
reason
why
a
spread
couldn’t
have
been
used
on
the
day
of
trial
as
well.
especially,
since
it’s
eight
months
later
and
the
individual
is
going
to
attempt
the
courtroom
identification.
i
think,
that
there
was
a
responsibility
to
show
him
to
not
to
prejudice
that
courtroom
identification
by
showing
one
photographic
again.
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
i
think
under
the
totality
test
that
judge
friendly
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
that’s
correct.
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
i
might
say
that
i
doubt
if
there
would
be
a
retrial,
i
don’t
that
you
could
be
trying
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
i
certainly
am.
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
certainly
am.
i
don’t
think
--
i
think
that
there
is
substantial
question
of
his
guilt
in
this
case.
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
in
this
particular
case,
on
these
facts
the
evidence
is
not
admissible,
your
honor.
mr.
david
s.
golub
he
would
--
there
would
be
no
other
--
since
there
is
no
other
evidence,
he
would
have
to
go
free.
that
is
correct.
the
other
thing
that
i
think
comes
through
from
the
court’s
opinions
on
deterrent
rules
is
that
a
cross-benefit
analysis
is
properly
applied
and
we
set
forth
the
cross-benefit
analysis
in
the
brief.
mr.
david
s.
golub
that’s
correct;
i
meant
to
answer
with
respect
to
the
totality
test,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
the
totality
test,
judge
friendly
found
that
both
the
in-court
and
out-of-court
were
impermissibly
suggestive,
giving
rise
to
misidentification.
under
the
per
se
rule,
there
would
still
be
a
finding
possible
on
the
in-court
identification.
mr.
david
s.
golub
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
s.
golub
it
would
not
automatically
preclude
it.
practically
speaking,
however,
since
the
tests
are
so
similar,
it’s
unlikely
that
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
certainly
believe
that
there
would
be
out
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
don’t
think
he
is
clear
in
his
opinion
as
to
why
he
is
suppressing
the
in-court
identification.
mr.
david
s.
golub
he
raised
it
in
the
court
in
our
brief
and
he
did
not
specifically
articulate,
why
he
was
suppressing
the
in-court.
as
i
read
the
opinion
he
said,
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
oh
no,
we
do
not
claim
that,
we
certainly
not.
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
i
think
it’s
correct
on
these
facts,
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
on
these
facts
only,
it’s
correct,
and
that’s
all
i
meant
to
say
with
respect
to
these
facts.
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
think
that’s
--
and
i
think,
he
is
holding
that
neither
one
could
be
used
in
the
pretrial.
mr.
david
s.
golub
yes,
i
think
he
is
holding
that
neither
one
could
be
used
to
trial
on
these
facts.
i
think
he
is
not
holding
that
on
another
facts
an
in-court
identification
would
not
be
admissible.
mr.
david
s.
golub
on
a
retrial,
the
state
would,
yes.
mr.
david
s.
golub
yes,
i
believe
that
that
would
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
think,
there
is
no
change
at
all.
he
is
--
mr.
david
s.
golub
that’s
how
i
read
the
opinion
also,
your
honor.
mr.
david
s.
golub
thank
you.
