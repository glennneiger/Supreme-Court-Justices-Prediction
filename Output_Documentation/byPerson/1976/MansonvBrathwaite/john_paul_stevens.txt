justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gaffney,
is
the
testimony
about
what
was
said
during
the
confrontation
consistent
with
it
being
two
or
three
minutes
in
duration,
wasn’t
it
quite
a
brief
conversation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
now
you
say
that
--
wouldn’t
have
been
two
or
three
minutes
in
that
conversation,
would
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
--
maybe
i
--
maybe
my
memory
fails
me.
i
thought
that
the
door
was
closed
after
the
first
conversation.
then
after
a
few
more
minutes,
it
opened
again
and
there
was
another
conversation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
put
my
question
a
little
more
precisely.
the
two
or
three
minute
observation;
is
it
your
view
that
the
conversation
took
two
or
three
minutes
or
that
there
was
a
very
brief
conversation?
they
stood
for
another
two
minutes
looking
at
one
other
silently.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
golub,
is
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
arrested
in
the
apartment
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
the
identification
was
reliable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
make
my
question
a
little
more
precise.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
evidence,
which
one
might
assume
to
be
relevant
to
the
issue
of
guilt,
like
we
can
assume
brathwaite,
he
was
arrested
in
the
apartment,
he
went
there
many
times
is
relevant
on
guilt,
can
we
consider
that
in
determining
whether
the
identification
is
reliable
or
are
they
two
entirely
separate
things?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
don’t
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
is
differ
to
the
district
court
on
the
credibility
of
the
witness
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
golub,
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
officer
d’onofrio
knew
that
the
defendant
frequented
this
apartment
before
he
received
this
description?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
area?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
necessarily
in
this
particular
apartment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
just
go
on
step
further.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
is
it
a
fair
inference
that
d’onofrio
picked
out
this
picture
on
the
basis
of
the
description
given
to
him
by
glover?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gaffney,
if
we
apply
the
totality
of
circumstances
test,
am
i
correct
in
assuming
that
that
would
mean
both
the
in-court
and
the
out-of-court
identifications
would
always
stand
and
fall
together?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn’t
the
inquiry
as
to
whether
it’s
reliable
or
not,
and
if
it
is
reliable,
or
you
pass
it
for
the
out-of-courts
or
in-courts?
