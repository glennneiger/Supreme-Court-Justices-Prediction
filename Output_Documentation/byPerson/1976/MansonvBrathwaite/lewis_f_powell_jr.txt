justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
golub,
did
you
suggest
earlier
that
you
and
your
colleague
stipulated
that
no
hearing
was
necessary
before
judge
blumenfeld?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
rest
upon
the
state
transcript.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
as
to
the
unusual
practice,
is
an
unusual
practice
for
police
officer
to
look
at
the
mugshots?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
it
or
isn’t
that
rather
normal
for
a
police
officer?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
is
it
normal
for
them
to
look
at
mugshots?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
how
could
he
normally
find
one
mugshot?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
a
book
full
pictures,
that’s
not
one
mugshot.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
with
police
officers,
they
are
different
from
ordinary
people;
they
are
trained.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
suppose
a
police
officer
comes
out
and
says,
“the
man,
i
saw,
was
5
foot
8,
180
pounds,
a
negro,
with
blond
hair,
blue
eyes,
and
a
scar
across
his
face,
and
you
show
him
a
picture
of
that,
what’s
wrong
with
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
that’s
the
best
you
can
do?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
can
you
drop
the
picture
until
after
you
have
got
a
full
description
of
him,
good
enough
to
be
able
to
pick
out
the
picture?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
can
we
find
one
with
a
cheek
bone?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
are
causing
so
many
doubts
about
the
cheek
bone.
