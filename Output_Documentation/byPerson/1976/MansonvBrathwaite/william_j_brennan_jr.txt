just
to
go,
we
don’t
have
in
current
findings
here
too.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
it’s
case
for
the
two
court
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
over
a
dissent,
that
was
a
case
for
the
two
court
rule.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
golub,
certainly
judge
friendly
at
least
inferred
a
bias
in
glover,
didn’t
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
that
judge
blumenfeld
did
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that
on
a
retrial
that
would
--
however,
if
over
an
in-court
identification
by
glover,
then
the
state
would
have
to
go
forward
also
and
show
there
was
an
independent
basis,
not
related
to
the
show-up.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
state
will
have
to
show,
in
addition
to
glover’s
in-court
identification
of
brathwaite
that
that
identification
was
rested
upon
a
basis
independent
of
the
show-up,
would
it?
