justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
am
not
sure
about
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
thought
you
said
a
while
ago
that
adopting
a
per
se
rule
wouldn’t
necessarily
take
taint
in-court
identification.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let’s
assume
that
the
per
se
rule
is
not
adopted
for
the
out-of-court
identification
but
that
the
totality
was
a
substantial
likelihood
of
misidentification.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
let’s
assume
that
in
a
particular
case,
applying
that
rule,
it
was
found
that
the
pretrial
identification
was
so
suggestive
that
it
should
not
be
admissible
because
of
the
substantial
likelihood
of
misidentification.
would
that
automatically
preclude
any
in-court
identification?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
know
but
there
is
a
--
but
why
wouldn’t
there
still
be
a
question
open
at
the
trial
whether
that
was
an
independent
basis
for
the
identification?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
if
that
is
true
--
judge
friendly
did
not
go
through
that
routine.
he
just
found
on
the
latter
and
other
part
of
his
opinion
that,
on
the
totality
if
the
out-of-court
identification
was
bad,
the
in-court
automatically
was,
didn’t
he?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
at
least
he
never
inquired
whether
there
was
any
independent
basis
for
the
in-court.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
in
any
event,
you
don’t
--
whatever
the
rule
is
adopted
for
the
out-of-court
identification,
you
did
not
claim
did
that
automatically
disposes
of
the
in-court
identification.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
then
was
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall
correct
or
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
on
these
facts.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
next
case
is
number
75-871,
manson
against
brathwaite
which
comes
to
us
from
the
second
circuit.
this
focuses
on
the
reliability
of
eye-witness
identification.
the
pertinent
effect
took
place
in
hartford,
connecticut.
mr.
glover
was
a
state
trooper
assigned
to
the
narcotics
division
in
an
undercover
capacity.
he
purchased
heroin
from
a
seller
through
the
open
doorway
of
an
apartment
while
he
stood
for
two
or
three
minutes
within
two
feet
of
the
seller
in
a
hallway
illuminated
by
natural
light.
only
a
few
minutes
later,
glover
described
the
seller
to
another
police
officer
and
the
latter
suspecting
from
the
description
that
respondent
brathwaite
might
be
the
seller
left
a
police
photograph
of
brathwaite
with
glover
who
viewed
it
two
days
later
and
identified
it
as
the
picture
of
his
vendor.
brahtwaite
was
charged
in
a
connecticut
state
court
with
possession
and
sale
of
heroin,
and
at
his
trial,
held
some
eight
months
after
the
crime,
the
photograph
was
received
in
evidence
without
objection
and
glover
testified
that
there
was
no
doubt
whatsoever
that
the
person
shown
in
the
photograph
was
brathwaite
and
he
also
made
a
positive
in-court
identification
without
objection.
brathwaite
was
convicted
and
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
affirmed.
brathwaite
then
went
to
habeas,
alleging
that
the
admission
of
the
identification
testimony
deprived
him
of
due
process
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
petition
and
the
second
circuit
however
reversed
holding
that
evidence
as
to
the
photograph
should
have
been
excluded
regardless
of
reliability
because
the
examination
of
the
single
photograph
was
unnecessary
and
suggestive,
and
in
any
event
in
this
case
was
unreliable.
we
reversed
and
hold
the
due
process
clause
does
not
compel
the
exclusion
of
the
identification
evidence.
we
regard
reliability
as
the
linchpin
and
determining
the
admissibility
of
identification
testimony
for
both
confrontations
occurring
both
prior
to
and
after
a
case
decided
here
in
1967
called
stovall
against
denno.
there
the
court
had
held
that
the
determination
of
reliability
depends
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
the
factors
to
be
considered
include
the
witness'
opportunity
to
view
the
criminal
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
the
witness'
degree
of
attention,
the
accuracy
of
his
prior
description,
the
level
of
certainty
demonstrated
at
the
confrontation,
and
the
time
between
the
crime
and
the
confrontation.
in
this
case,
it
does
not,
in
our
view,
exists
any
substantial
likelihood
of
irreparable
misidentification.
glover
was
no
casual
observer.
he
was
a
trained
police
officer.
he
had
a
sufficient
opportunity
to
view
the
suspect.
he
described
him
accurately.
he
positively
identified
the
photograph
and
he
made
the
identification
within
two
days
of
the
crime.
mr.
justice
stevens
while
joining
the
opinion
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
then
joined
therein
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
