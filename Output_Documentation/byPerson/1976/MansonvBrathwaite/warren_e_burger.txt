chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
75-871,
manson
against
brathwaite.
mr.
gaffney,
i
think,
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
this
was
not
the
only
narcotics
case
in
hartford
in
that
period
of
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
golub.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
see
he
treated
--
he
regarded
it
as
a
tainted,
that
the
second
was
tainted
by
the
first.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
second
circuit
has
done?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
does
the
court
mean
when
it
says,
as
justice
harlan
said
in
this
context
that
we
must
review
these
on
a
case-by-case
basis?
does
that
mean
that
our
scope
of
examination
of
the
record
is
less
than
that
of
the
court
of
appeal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
quite
right
but
perhaps,
it
has
--
the
court
has
a
different
attitude
when
a
court
of
appeals,
the
first
reviewing
court
undertakes
to
review
credibility
without
overseeing
the
witnesses.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
court
of
appeals
undertook
to
review
the
credibility,
i
am
sure,
did
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
did
judge
friendly
have
to
say
about
the
credibility?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
district
court
followed
the
more
traditional
rule
that
on
a
court
record
you
don’t
re-examine
credibility.
did
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
any
cross-examination
of
the
officer
opening
up
and
gauntleting
these
facts
that
judge
friendly
seem
to
rely
on.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
glover
then
found
not
a
credible
witness,
by
default,
in
effect,
does
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
he
presumed
the
contrary.
did
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
he
either
accepted
the
policeman’s
testimony
or
not,
and
which
did
he
do?
he
rejected
it,
did
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
rejects
totally
and
completely,
does
it
not,
the
in-court
identification
of
the
accused?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1
o’clock
counsel.
mr.
golub,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
how
would
prosecutors
considerably
be
having
the
responsibility
for
the
identification
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
do
you
mean
that
he
might
be
(inaudible)
for
using
or
attempting
to
employ
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
an
identification?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there
is
something
wrong
with
a
lawyer
showing
potential
witness,
some
of
the
evidence
they
are
going
to
be
dealing
with
before
a
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that’s
essentially
like
interviewing
the
witness.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
any
further
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
