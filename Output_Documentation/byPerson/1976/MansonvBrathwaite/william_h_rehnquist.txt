justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
glover
a
full-time
police
officer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose,
if
there
had
been
a
contemporary
objection
at
trial,
the
state
might
have
had
an
opportunity
or
might
have
been
motivated
to
flush
the
thing
out
a
little
more.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr
golub
wouldn’t
a
good
deal
of
the
speculation
that
you
are
now
indulging
in,
be
permitted
if
there
had
been
a
contemporaneous
objection
and
this
could
have
been
argued
out
in
the
trial
court
at
the
glover
cross-examined
as
to
how
he
really
knew
this
was
the
same
man?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
did
too.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wasn’t
judge
blumenfeld
talking
about,
whether
there
was
raised
it
up
all
on
habeas
in
the
absence
of
a
contemporaneous
objection
rather
than
question
of
the
degree
of
speculation
you
could
go
into
about
people’s
motives
and
that
sort
of
thing,
if
you
haven’t
raised
it
at
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
burden
is
on
you
in
a
habeas
proceeding,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
case
do
you
rely
on
for
that
proposition?
