justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
the
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
except
a
picture.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
he
wait
two
days
to
pick
up
this
horrible
criminal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
was
the
delay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
went
there
for
the
purpose
of
finding
somebody
to
arrest,
didn’t
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
why
did
he
purchase
narcotics?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
long
or
more
than
10
minutes,
does
that
take?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it’s
the
same
town;
same
town?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
and
i
know
hartford
is
not
the
largest
city
in
the
world.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
i
am
trying
to
find
why
he
had
two
days
before
he
picked
this
horrible
criminal
up?
in
the
meantime,
he
is
violating
the
law.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
independent
answer
do
you
have
to
my
question
without
help?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
had
been
identified
by
a
person
trained
in
identifying
people
and
giving
accurate
descriptions.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
want
to
loose
that
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mean
that
in
case
in
which
police
authorities
show
a
picture
to
a
complaint
witness,
automatically
no
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
what
are
you
saying?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
don’t
want
the
automatic
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
total
you
have
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
total
evidence
that
you
have
here
that
takes
you
out
of
that
automatic
room?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
how
much
time
would
it
take?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said,
how
much
time
will
it
take
for
me
to
look
at
you
before
i
can
identify
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
much
if
i
were
a
well-trained
police
official;
how
long
would
it
take?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
two-three
minutes
be
enough?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
was
two
or
three
in
this
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
one
minute
short.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
follow
which
court,
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
which
courts
should
we
follow
under
facts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
which
court
should
we
follow?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
sure?
[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
have
the
whole
the
transcript
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it’s
part
of
the
record
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
on
the
retrial
it
was
ordered,
you
can’t
use
either
identification?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
judge
friendly
said,
you
can
use
either
of
this
--
either
of
identification.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
would
you
convict
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
mean,
you
think
he
just
be
turned
lose.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
don’t
really
think
that
--
you
are
not
urging
that
deterrence
may
lose,
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
or
no,
or
you
are,
(voice
overlap).
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
only
point
you
have
is
that
they
showed
him
this
picture
and
on
the
basis
on
them
showing
him
this
picture,
he
goes
free.
he
can
never
be
convicted
under
any
circumstance.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so
he
is
free.
justice
thurgood
marshall
reading
from
page
27a,
“assuming
which
we
do
not
believe
that
simmons
states
a
proper
test
for
both
of
glover’s
identifications,
we
hold
that
both
were
inadmissible”
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
is
too
essential
from
the
bottom-line.
