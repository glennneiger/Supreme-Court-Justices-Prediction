mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
my
name
is
bernard
gaffney
and
i
am
an
assistant
in
the
office
of
the
state’s
attorney
in
hartford,
connecticut.
i
might
say
that
in
addition
to
representing
the
petitioner
in
this
appeal,
i
represented
the
state
in
the
trial
of
the
case
in
the
superior
court
in
hartford
and
i
have
also
represented
the
state
in
the
various
judicial
proceedings
which
have
followed
in
both
the
state
and
the
federal
courts.
this
case
arose
from
an
undercover
narcotics
investigation
in
hartford
factually
on
the
evening
of
may
5,
1970.
an
undercover
state
police
officer,
jimmy
glover
and
an
informant
went
to
the
third
floor
of
an
apartment
building
on
westland
street
in
hartford
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
purchasing
narcotics.
now
there
are
some
questions
as
to
whether
glover
and
the
informant
went
to
the
specific
apartment
unit
on
the
third
floor
that
they
had
intended
to
go
to
and
there
is
no
question
that
when
they
got
there,
the
transaction
was
with
some
other
person
than
had
been
intended.
however,
there
is
no
question
that
officer
glover
in
exchange
for
$20
purchased
two
glassine
envelopes
containing
heroin.
in
court,
glover
made
a
positive
identification
of
the
respondent,
known
brathwaite,
as
the
seller
of
the
narcotic.
now
if
may
i
just
go
on,
the
sale
took
place
at
the
doorway
to
the
apartment
and
the
testimony
was
that
the
total
transaction,
that
is
from
its
very
start
to
its
conclusion,
took
some
where
between
five
and
seven
minutes,
and
during
this
total
period,
the
door
to
the
apartment
remained
open
for
a
period
of
about
three
minutes
and
the
seller
was
standing
in
the
doorway.
and
glover
said
that
during
this
3-minute
period,
he
stood
within
2
feet
of
his
seller
and
was
looking
directly
at
his
face,
and
he
went
on
to
say
that
he
had
absolutely
no
trouble
in
seeing
in
the
hallway.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
the
transaction
your
honor
took
place
at
approximately
or
began
at
approximately
7:45
pm.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
may
5,
1970.
now
judge
friendly,
in
his
opinion,
the
second
circuit
court
opinion,
pointed
out
that
sunset
on
that
day
had
occurred
7:53
pm.
now
outside
the
building
at
the
conclusion
of
the
transaction,
glover
gave
a
description
of
his
seller
to
officer
michael
d’onofrio
of
the
hartford
police
department.
d’onofrio
was
stationed
outside
the
building
as
a
covering
officer.
now
d’onofrio
knew
brathwaite
by
sight.
he
had
seen
him
on
a
number
of
occasions
prior
to
the
date
of
the
sale
and
he
recognized
the
description,
which
glover
gave
as
applying
to
brathwaite.
now
that
night
or
the
following
date,
d’onofrio
obtained
a
photograph
of
brathwaite
from
the
files
of
the
hartford
police
department
and
he
took
that
photograph
over
to
state
police
headquarters
and
he
left
it
on
glover’s
desk.
and
i
might
point
out
parenthetically
that
the
office
of
the
state
police
headquarters
in
hartford
and
the
city
of
hartford
police
headquarters
are
in
two
different
buildings,
geographically
separated
from
one
another
by
some
distance.
now
a
day
or
two
later,
specifically
on
may
7th,
glover
returned
to
his
office
and
he
found
the
photo
which
d’onofrio
had
left
on
his
desk
and
he
positively
identified
the
person
shown
in
the
photograph
as
the
same
person
from
whom
he
had
purchased
the
narcotics.
and
i
think
it’s
worth
mentioning
that
at
the
time
he
did
that,
that
at
the
time
glover
viewed
the
photo,
d’onofrio
was
not
present,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
no
evidence
that
there
was
any
contact
between
d’onofrio
and
glover,
between
the
date
of
the
sale
and
the
date
of
the
photographic
viewing,
and
no
evidence,
whatsoever,
of
any
verbal
influence
or
pressure
brought
by
d’onofrio
upon
glover
to
make
an
identification.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
yes,
your
honor,
except
the
picture.
now
after
it
was
confirmed
by
analysis
that
the
substance
sold
was,
in
fact,
heroin,
police
arrested
brathwaite.
it’s
more
than
a
little
significance,
i
would
submit,
that
brathwaite’s
arrest
occurred
at
the
very
same
apartment
from
which
the
sale
had
taken
place.
that
was
not
brathwaite’s
home,
he
lived
at
another
address
on
albany
avenue
in
hartford
and
the
westland
street
address
was
occupied
by
a
mrs.
ramsey.
now
brathwaite
said
on
cross-examination
that
he
had
visited
that
apartment
on
westland
street
many
times
prior
to
the
date
of
the
offense
and
that
mrs.
ramsey
who
occupied
that
apartment
was
a
friend
of
the
family.
now
during
the
trial,
through
officer
glover,
the
state
offered
testimonial
evidence
of
the
photographic
identification
and
the
photo
itself,
and
officer
glover
made
a
positive
in-court
identification
of
brathwaite.
now
the
principal
issue
before
this
court,
as
i
understand
it,
is
whether
the
case
of
stovall
and
denno,
which
this
court
decided
in
june
1967,
established
a
strict
exclusionary
rules,
such
that
the
admission
of
evidence
of
a
pretrial
identification,
an
unnecessary
and
suggestive
pretrial
identification,
renders
a
criminal
accuse,
conviction
and
violation
of
due
process
standards.
that
is
what
the
federal
appeals
court
said
in
reversing
the
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court
that
stovall
did
establish
such
a
rule
and
that
the
rule
was
violated
by
the
state.
now
the
petitioner
has
conceded
that
the
procedure
which
the
police
used
was
suggestive
and
that
it
did
consist
of
one
photo
show
up,
and
we’ve
also
considered
that
the
procedure
used
by
the
police
was
unnecessary,
because
there
really
was
no
emergency
that
existed
and
no
exigent
circumstances
that
would
have
prohibited
the
police
from
restoring
to
some
more
reliable
technique.
we
dispute
the
fact,
however,
that
the
suggestiveness
was
in
anyway
pronounced
or
aggravated
or
even
remotely
like
that,
which
existed
in
the
foster
case,
foster
and
california,
which
was
decided
after
stovall,
i
believe,
in
1969.
and
i
emphasize
in
making
that
point
that
it
detective
d’onofrio
knew
brathwaite
by
sight,
that
he
had
seen
him
on
a
number
of
prior
occasions,
and
that
he
recognized
the
description
which
glover
gave
him.
and
i
also
stress
that
d’onofrio
was
not
present
when
glover
made
his
identification
from
the
photograph
and
exerted
no
verbal
influence
upon
him.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
although
the
pretrial
photo
identification
procedure
was
unnecessarily
suggestive,
there
was
no
great
likelihood
of
any
misidentification
under
all
of
the
facts.
now
with
respect
to
the
issue
before
your
honors,
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
a
strict
rule
of
exclusion,
nowhere
in
the
language
of
mr.
justice
brennan’s
opinion
in
the
stovall
case,
and
i
am
referring
to
part
2
of
that
opinion,
nowhere
did
the
words
‘exclusionary
rule’
or
‘strict
exclusionary
rule’
appear.
what
the
court
said
on
page
302
of
that
opinion
is
that,
“a
claimed
violation
of
due
process
of
law
or
the
conduct
of
a
confrontation
depends
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
which
surrounded.”
and
the
same
overriding
principle
was
restated
about
a
year
after
stovall,
in
the
simmons
case
recorded
in
390
u.s.
and
in
that
case,
mr.
justice
harlan
said,
“we
hold
that
each
case
must
be
considered
on
its
own
facts”,
and
he
went
on
later
in
the
opinion
to
say
that
convictions
will
be
set
aside,
only
if
the
procedure
was
so
impermissibly
suggestive
as
to
give
rise
to
a
very
substantial
likelihood
of
irreparable
misidentification.
now
in
april
of
1969,
the
foster
case
to
which
i
have
alluded,
foster
against
california,
adopted
the
same
language
residing
that
identification
procedure
should
be
judged
“in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances”,
and
your
honors
i
am
sure
will
recall
that
in
that
case
there
were
repeated
procedures
used
by
the
police
which
the
court
said
violated
due
process,
and
that
conviction,
i
believe,
was
reversed.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
foster
against
california,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
yeah,
i
don’t
think
it
was
justice
fortas;
i
think
justice
fortas
may
have
written
the
opinion
in
coleman
against
alabama.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
alright,
i
stand
--
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
coleman
and
alabama,
i
know,
was
decided
after
foster
in
1970.
again,
similar
language,
‘totality
of
the
surrounding
circumstances’
has
been
the
key
to
evaluating
or
assessing
the
prejudicial
effect
of
a
pretrial
line
up
in
that
case.
now
more
recently,
of
course,
in
the
case
of
neil
and
biggers,
decided
in
december
of
1972,
this
court
said
in
rather
specific
language
that
it’s
the
reliability
of
the
evidence
under
all
of
the
circumstances,
which
is
the
central
question.
so
that
its
overall
reliability,
which
is
paramount,
as
i
read
the
case,
even
though
the
identification
procedure
may
have
been
suggestive.
that
is
the
precision
which
the
petitioner
takes
in
this
appeal
that
the
admission
of
the
show
up
without
more,
and
the
language
used
by
justice
powell,
does
not
violate
due
process
and
that
each
case
should
be
decided
on
its
own
facts.
now
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
if
the
biggers
criteria,
those
annunciated
by
mr.
justice
powell
in
that
case,
are
applied
to
the
instant
case
that
glover’s
identification
is
wholly
reliable.
and
the
reasons
for
that
contention,
i
have
tried
to
set
forth
beginning
on
page
12
of
the
petitioner’s
brief,
the
opportunity
to
view
the
suspect.
glover
was
at
very
close
quarters,
at
the
doorway
to
the
apartment.
he
was
looking
directly
at
his
subject
and
the
door
was
open
during
that
period
for
up
to
three
minutes.
the
degree
of
attention
--
here
you
have
a
trained
police
officer.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
yes,
he
was,
your
honor,
with
the
state
police,
acting
at
that
time
with
an
undercover
narcotics
unit.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
the
conversation,
your
honor,
was
brief;
there
is
no
question
about
that.
the
door
opened,
it
was
then,
while
the
door
was
open,
that
a
conversation
occurred,
the
door
closed.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
there
would
not
done
been
two
or
three
minutes
of
conversation
but
the
testimony,
as
i
read
it,
was
that
the
door
--
and
this
would
relate
particularly
to
the
time
after
which
it
was
first
open
that
during
that
period
up
to
two
to
three
minutes
was
consumed.
now
i
assume
that
during
that
period,
brathwaite
wanted
to
be
sure
that
he
could
deal
with
the
parties
that
were
attempting
to
buy
from
him.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
well,
the
conversation,
when
the
door
opened
the
second
time,
was
quite
brief.
by
that
time,
brathwaite,
the
seller,
had
obtained
the
narcotics
and
it
was
more
a
matter
of
getting
them
into
the
hands
of
the
buyer.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
well,
i
think
more
like
the
latter,
your
honor,
because
for
the
reason,
as
i
have
tried
to
indicate
that
the
seller
wanted
to
be
sure
that
he
could
deal
with
the
parties
in
front
of
him,
that
he
wasn’t
being
set
up.
and
the
conversation
would
not
necessarily
have
had
any
bearing
on
that,
but
i
think
that
the
two
or
three
minutes
took
place
initially
and
that
the
period
of
time,
after
the
door
opened
the
second
time,
was
much
briefer.
insofar
as
the
degree
of
attention,
as
i
have
indicated,
officer
glover
was
a
trained
officer,
trained
police
officer,
and,
of
course,
he
was
on
a
potentially
dangerous
assignment.
i
think
you
can
feel
sure,
at
least
i
felt
sure,
that
he
was
careful
in
viewing
his
subject.
the
accuracy
of
the
description,
certainly
as
brathwaite
appeared
in
court,
he
complied
with
the
description.
given
the
level
of
certainty,
officer
glover
was
unequivocal
in
his
identification
in-court
and
the
length
of
time
between
the
crime,
the
date
of
the
crime,
and
the
confrontation
was
relatively
brief,
a-day-and-a-half,
perhaps
two
days
at
the
very
most.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
well,
it
wasn’t
that
he
waited
two
days
to
pick
him
up.
it
was
two
days,
at
most,
when
glover
got
back
to
his
office
to
find
the
photograph
on
his
desk.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
well,
i
don’t
know
that,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
there
was
any
delay.
i
think
that
he
--
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
not
to
arrest,
to
purchase
narcotics
from,
your
honor.
there
was
no
intent
--
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
well,
the
arrest
would
follow
after
the
analysis
to
determine
what,
in
fact
--
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
well,
the
analysis
is
made
by
the
state
laboratory
in
hartford,
unfortunately.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
no,
i
understand
that.[laughter
attempt]
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
yes,
i
think
that’s
accurate
to
say,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
oh
no,
by
no
means,
your
honor,
by
no
means.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
well,
[laughter]
the
delay,
insofar
as
the
confrontation
occurred
and
glover’s
not
getting
back
to
his
office
until
may
7,
that
is
may
5
to
may
7;
as
far
as
the
arrest
is
concerned
that
would
not,
under
the
procedures
used
in
hartford,
that
would
not
have
occurred
until
after
it
was
confirmed
by
analysis,
toxicological
analysis,
that
the
substance
purchased
was,
in
fact,
narcotic.
now
that
did
not
happen,
mr.
justice
marshall,
until
some
time
in
july,
and
i
concede
that
that
is
a
rather
extended
delay
and
all
that
i
can
tell
you
is
that
it
relates
to
the
backlog,
the
work-log
of
the
state
laboratory
in
hartford.
after
it
was
confirmed,
as
i
recall
it,
brathwaite’s
arrest
took
place,
not
too
long
thereafter.
now
the
rationale,
of
course,
or
the
reasoning
for
the
strict
exclusionary
rule
as
justice
powell
wrote,
is
to
deter
the
police
from
using
a
less
reliable
procedure
when
a
more
reliable
one
would
be
available
to
them,
to
the
police.
the
court
said
that
the
rule
would
not
be
premised
on
the
assumption
that
the
admission
of
the
evidence
of
such
a
confrontation
offends
due
process.
now
if
that’s
the
case,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
the
first
instance
the
question
is
whether
such
a
strict
rule
is
going
to
have
any
real
deterrent
effect
on
the
police.
now
justice
blackmun
discussed
that
issue
in
a
recent
case
decided
this
past
july,
u.s.
against
janis.
i
think
that
was
a
fourth
amendment
case,
but
based
on
the
court’s
discussion
in
the
janis
case,
it
would
seem
that
there
is
more
than
a
little
doubt
that,
in
fact,
such
a
rule,
an
exclusionary
rule,
has
a
deterrent
effect,
at
least
some
doubt
among
the
analysts
or
the
statisticians
or
those
who
have
perhaps
looked
into
it.
but
assuming
that
it
does,
assuming
that
it
will
have
a
deterrent
effect,
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
what
is
important
is
that
there
is
no
compelling
need
today
for
such
a
strict
rule.
now
my
experience,
i
can
see
it
is
limited
to
connecticut
and
more
specifically,
hartford
in
the
areas
that
surround
hartford,
but
i
have
been
exposed
over
the
years
to
a
great,
great
many
cases
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
the
abuses
today
are
minimum,
whether
the
police
are
learning
or
what
the
reason
is,
i
am
really
not
prepared
to
say,
but
i
can
say
this
that
in
my
experience
photo
show-ups
and
highly
suggestive
procedures
are
the
exception
today
and
not
the
rule;
that
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
where
photo
show-ups,
for
example,
are
used,
they
are
used
by
the
police
because
of
circumstances
which
maybe
peculiar
to
the
case
or
to
confirm
the
identity
of
a
person
who
is
already
known.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
that
certainly
does
help,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
no,
i
don’t,
no.
that’s
important.
if
the
basic
purpose
of
a
trial
is
the
determination
of
the
truth,
and
mr
justice
stewart
said
that
in
the
teahn
and
shott
case
decided
in
382
u.s.
at
416
and
i
suppose
that’s
really
axiomatic,
but
i
certainly
subscribe
to
it.
if
you
accept
that,
i
submit
that
the
prosecution
then
should
not
be
prohibited
in
all
cases
from
introducing
this
type
of
evidence,
because
the
effect
of
the
rule
will
then
be
to
keep
out
what
in
most
cases
is
really
relevant
evidence
and
in
many
cases,
certainly
prohibitive
evidence
and
perhaps
valid
evidence
as
well.
now
mr.
justice
blackmun
said
jurists
and
scholars
uniformly
have
recognized
that
the
exclusionary
rule
imposes
a
substantial
cost
and
suicidal
interest
in
law
enforcement
by
its
proscription
of
what
concededly
is
relevant
evidence,
that
in
the
janis
case
to
which
i
just
referred
and
i
guess
that’s
really
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make.
something
will
be
lost
in
many
of
the
trials
if
such
a
rule
is
adopted.
and
as
an
aside
and
as
a
practical
matter
from
one
who
is
a
prosecutor
in
cases,
such
as
this
one
where
you
have
a
one
witness
identification,
glover
being
the
sole
identifying
witness,
the
evidence
is
going
to
come
in
to
the
case
anyway.
the
defense
in
its
cross-examination
of
the
state’s
chief
identifying
witness,
undoubtedly,
in
most
cases
at
least
is
going
to
offer
the
evidence
for
the
purpose
of
undermining
the
chief
identification
witness
for
the
state.
now
i
submit
that
if
that
occurs,
the
state,
in
many
cases,
is
going
to
be
placed
in
a
bad
light.
jury
simply
are
not
going
to
understand
that
the
state,
because
of
the
inadmissibility
of
the
evidence,
wasn’t
permitted
to
offer
it
in
the
first
instance
and
having
failed
to
present
it,
i
submit
again,
the
state
just
is
not
going
to
look
good.
juries
want
to
hear
all
of
the
evidence.
it’s
been
my
experience
that
they
don’t
like
objections.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
i
don’t
know
that
it’s
a
cogent
argument,
your
honor,
for
deciding
whether
there
should
be
a
rule
or
not,
i
offer
it
more
in
the
practical
sense,
but
if
in
a
case,
such
as
this
one
where
you
have
a
one
witness
identification,
and
the
state
presents
that
witness
and
he
makes
an
in-court
identification
without
any
reference
to
the
pretrial
procedure,
the
defense,
in
the
great
majority
of
cases,
is
going
to
cross-examine
that
witness
and
develop
that
there
was
a
pretrial
procedure
to
point
out
how
defective
it
was,
how
suggestive
it
was.
so
that
the
evidence
is
in
the
case,
anyway,
and
the
jury
sitting
and
hearing
that
evidence
come
in
for
the
first
time
--
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
--
will
wonder
why
didn’t
the
state
--
why
are
we
hearing
it
now
from
the
defendant.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
and
i
submit
that
that
doesn’t
make
the
state
look
very
good.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
now
if
there
is
no
such
rule
and
the
evidence,
at
least
in
some
cases,
is
offered
by
the
prosecution,
i
submit
that
certainly
the
trial
judge,
in
an
appropriate
instruction,
can
advise
the
jury
of
the
weaknesses
and
the
dangers
and
the
deficiencies
of
such
suggestive
pretrial
procedures
by
the
police.
in
summary,
it’s
the
position
of
the
petitioner
that
stovall
and
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
since
stovall
did
not
establish
a
strict
exclusionary
rule
that
due
process
standards
do
not
require
and
that
there
is
no
compelling
need
for
the
adoption
of
such
a
rule
today,
particularly
if
the
objective
is
the
deterrent
effect
on
the
police.
and
that
the
key
question
is
really
one
of
reliability,
reliability
of
the
identification
of
evidence
under
all
of
the
circumstances
and
whether
or
not
withstanding
some
suggestive
pretrial
procedure,
whether
there
is
really
any
great
substantial
likelihood
of
the
reparable
misidentification.
in
short,
that
the
cases
should
be
decided
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
now
--
and
what
i
have
referred
to
in
the
petitioners’
brief
as
a
contingency
opinion,
judge
friendly
said
that
even
if
there
was
no
exclusionary
rule,
even
if
it
was
wrong
in
that
conclusion,
the
respondent
should
be
given
a
new
trial,
and
for
other
reasons
--
and
i
concede
that
he
had
a
right,
the
appeals
court
had
a
right,
to
examine
the
record
and
interpret
the
legal
significance
of
all
of
the
facts
in
the
context
of
due
process,
but
when
the
court
decided
that
officer
glover
was
not
a
reliable
witness,
not
a
credible
witness,
because
he
was
a
police
officer
whose
job
was
to
make
arrest;
that
an
ordinary
citizen
or
a
bi-standard
would
be
more
credible
witness;
that
glover’s
positive
in-court
identification
of
braithwaite
wasn’t
worthy
of
belief
because
braithwaite
was
the
only
person
sitting
at
the
counsel
table
and
that
he
must
have
made
dozens
of
other
arrests
between
the
time
of
the
offense
and
the
time
of
the
trial.
i
submit
that
in
that
connection
the
appeals
court
was
injecting
its
own
viewpoints,
its
own
personal
convictions
and
those
were
peculiarly,
i
would
think,
within
the
provenance
of
the
jury.
justice
frankfurter
in
malinski
case,
324
u.s.
at
page
417,
expressed
it
well
far
better
than
i
have,
when
he
said
the
judicial
judgment
in
applying
the
due
process
clause
was
moved
within
the
limits
of
accepted
notions
of
justice,
and
it
is
not
to
be
based
upon
the
idiosyncrasies
of
merely
personal
judgment.
an
important
safeguard
against
such
merely
individual
judgment
is
an
alert
deference
to
the
judgment
of
the
state
court
under
review.
and
if
i
may,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
maybe
left
to
me
for
rebuttal
argument.
thank
you.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
just
very
briefly,
your
honor,
if
i
may,
with
respect
to
some
of
mr.
mr.
golub’s
comments,
i
don’t
know
whether
he
meant
to
imply
or
actually
said
that
detective
d’onofrio
was
glover’s
superior
officer.
if
so,
that
is
not
accurate.
they
worked,
and
i
thought,
i
have
indicated
that
in
my
opening
argument,
for
entirely
separate
law
enforcement
agencies.
and
when
mr.
golub
mentioned
that
d’onofrio
said
after
glover
had
given
him
the
description,
“i
know
who
it
is,
it’s
brathwaite”,
perhaps
mr.
golub
meant
to
imply
that
that’s
what
was
going
through
d’onofrio’s
mind,
and
it
may
well
have,
but
he
did
not
make
any
such
statement
to
glover.
in
fact,
he
made
no
statement
of
any
kind
to
glover.
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
about
the
use
of
a
mugshot,
particularly,
one
mugshot
by
the
police,
and
it
is
true
that
this
does
occur
particularly
in
narcotics
cases
as
your
honors
probably
realized
the
undercover
officers
actually
go
out
into
the
drug
culture
try
to
get
to
know
these
people
in
garb,
which
is
totally
unpolice
like,
and
eventually,
when
they
do
recognize
and
get
to
know
the
dealers,
they
are
dealing
with
a
person
who
is
known
to
him,
to
the
buying
officer,
so
that
when
the
mugshot
is
used
thereafter;
most
frequently,
it’s
used
to
simply
to
confirm
the
identity
of
a
person
that’s
known
to
the
officer
that
bought
the
narcotics
and
that’s
a
little
bit
of
the
--
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
yes,
it
would,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
well,
i
suppose
that
would
be
true,
if
there
was
a
lapse
of
time,
particularly.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
that’s
right,
that’s
correct
because
there
are
great
many
persons
that
these
undercover
officers
deal
with
over
a
period
of
time.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
well,
no,
i
would
think
that
if
the
pretrial
procedure
was
found
to
be
defective
and
yet
there
could
be
an
independent
basis
shown
for
the
in-court
identification
apart
from
the
pretrial
procedure
that
the
state
could
hopefully
proceed
on
that
basis.
mr.
bernard
d.
gaffney
well,
yes,
i
guess
it’s
so
your
honor,
reliability
is
the
key.
