mr.
kier,
can
i
just
be
sure
i
understand
your
argument
in
this
very
point.
you
say
this
--
the
proper
view
is
that
the
state
requirement
speaks
that
the
time
of
sale
to
the
consumer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
ninth
circuit
and
the
solicitor
general
erroneously
said
that
the
time,
the
critical
time
was
the
time
of
packaging?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
were
they
talking
you
about
the
critical
time
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
statute
or
within
the
meaning
of
state
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
do
you
disagree
with
their
interpretation
of
the
federal
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
they
have,
they
have
in
effect
enforced
their
own
law
incorrectly
is
what
you’re
saying
then?
i’m
having
trouble
because
it
seems
to
me
that
you
maybe
arguing
your
opponent’s
case
if
you’re
saying
the
state
standard
is
a,
the
federal
standard
is
b,
therefore
they’re
different.
then
within
the
meaning
of
the
statue,
it
seems
to
me
you
lose
because
the
statute
says
you
cannot
have
different
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
how
your
argument
fits
together?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
you’re
saying
the
federal
statue
requires
the
department
of
agriculture
to
use
the
time
of
packaging
as
the
only
permissible
time
for
determining
all
this?
you
require
is
to
use
of
time
of
sale
is
the
only
permissible
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
say
the
correct
time,
you
mean
the
correct
time,
how
do
you
measure
correctness
by
federal
law,
by
state
law
or
what’s
better
way
to
do
the
job?
i’m
not
quite
--
i’m
just
--
that’s
what
i’m
having
trouble
understanding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
required
by
federal
statute?
