mr.
allan
j.
goodman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
begin
by
responding
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
question
and
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
about
the
time
and
accuracy.
it
is
in
fact
there
as
the
court
will
see
for
mr.
kier’s
brief,
i
think
he
is
just
a
little
flasher
in
the
oral
argument
that
the
petitioner’s
contention
as
in
is
amicus
contention
on
whose
behalf
i
rise
today
is
that
the
federal
standard
is
true
with
retail.
the
ninth
circuits’
reasoning
is
that
--
mr.
allan
j.
goodman
that
is
correct
your
honor.
true
weight
to
the
business
purchaser,
true
weight
to
the
individual
purchaser
because
that
is
the
only
way
in
which
a
businessman
for
example
--
mr.
allan
j.
goodman
no
your
honor,
we
don’t
think
that
it
is
and
i
will
come
to
the
point
in
a
minute
if
you
are
--
please
--
mr.
allan
j.
goodman
federal
--
the
ninth
circuit
decision
holds
that
the
standard
is
true
weight
at
the
time
of
shipment
from
the
packaging
plant,
but
that
and
that
reasonable
variations
are
allowed
thereafter.
our
principle
contention
on
this
point
is
that
the
phrase
“reasonable
variations”
has
been
misconstrued
by
the
ninth
circuit.
for
example,
we
know
and
this
court
will
of
course
recall
its
own
decisions
which
say
that
the
purpose
of
three
federal
statutes
at
issue
here;
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act,
the
fair
packaging
and
labeling
act
and
wholesome
meat
act
are
all
--
the
language
of
the
fair
packaging
and
labeling
act
to
provide
consumers
with
accurate
information
as
to
the
quantity
of
contents
and
other
statements
on
package
label.
secondly,
there
is
a
decision
of
the
second
circuit,
united
states
versus
great
atlantic
and
pacific
tea
company,
92
f.2nd
610
in
which
the
state
inspector
found
a
prints
of
butter,
one
pound
packages
of
butter
to
contain
less
product
than
stated
on
the
label
at
the
retail
store.
in
affirming
the
district
court’s
conviction
of
atlantic
and
pacific
tea
company
for
misbranding,
the
second
circuit
said
and
i
quote
“there
can
be
no
dispute
that
the
underweight
prints
of
butter
were
misbranded.
specifically
focusing
upon
the
reasonable
variations
language
in
the
statute.
let's
consider
the
analogous
statute
the
federal
insecticide,
fungicide,
and
rodenticide
act.
that
act
provides
as
to
the
two
of
three
acts
here
in
questions;
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
and
the
wholesome
meat
act
that
the
secretary
shall
require
true
weight
provided
that
reasonable
variations
maybe
permitted.
pursuant
to
that
statutory
command,
first,
the
secretary
of
agriculture
and
later
the
environmental
protection
administration,
both
require
that
some
packages
maybe
over
and
under
so
long
as
the
retail
packages
are
of
full
weight.
thus
in
that
case
as
the
court
may
recall
from
looking
at
the
briefs,
the
insecticide
act
is
true
weight
for
packaged
poisons.
there
should
be
no
reason
why
the
statute
at
issue
in
this
case
which
is
the
same
language
should
permit
short
weight
in
food
products.
let
me
turn
now
to
the
questions
of
preemption.
thus
the
first
step
is,
is
there
a
conflict
between
the
statutes?
we
have
to
deal
with
the
three
statutes
in
terms
to
the
historical
perspective.
the
first
is
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
which
as
the
court,
i’m
sure
recognizes
does
not
have
any
preempted
language.
so
the
question
is
in
this
court
for
example
in
campbell
versus
u.c.
does
this
statute
impermissibly
conflict,
does
the
california
law
impermissibly
conflict
with
the
federal.
so
our
position
is
that
it
doesn’t
because
as
i’ve
just
discussed
the
federal
law
requires
true
weighted
retail.
moreover,
even
if
there
is
a
conflict,
prior
decisions
of
this
court
especially
the
decision
of
last
term
in
great
atlantic
and
pacific
tea
company
versus
cottrell
specifically
permit
the
states
to
have
more
stringent
standards
provided
those
standards
are
not
discriminatory.
mr.
allan
j.
goodman
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
your
honor
as
referring
now
to
section
408
of
wholesome
meat
act.
let
me
proceed
directly
to
that
point
and
discuss
both
the
point
and
1461
of
15
u.s.c
which
is
the
fair
packaging
and
labeling
act
standard.
the
language
in
section
678
of
21
u.s.c
or
section
408
of
wholesome
meat
act
only
prescribes
that
states
may
not
have
marking
and
labeling
packaging
or
in
grit
requirements
which
are
in
addition
to
our
different
standard
under
the
federal
law.
however,
in
the
same
sentence,
later
in
the
same
clause,
it
gives
the
states
concurrent
jurisdiction
to
enforce
adulteration
and
misbranding
requirements
and
the
standard
to
the
met
as
so
long
as
the
state
requirements
for
adulteration
and
misbranding
are
consistent
with
the
requirements
under
the
wholesome
meat
act.
and
thus,
the
only
standard
which
the
state
must
follow,
which
the
states
must
follow
on
the
wholesome
meat
act
is
the
same
as
under
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act.
what
congress
said,
marking,
packaging,
labeling
an
ingredients
are
preempted,
but
misbranding
is
not.
now
contrary
to
respondent’s
assertion
and
contrary
to
the
assertion
for
example
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
national
independent
meat
pack
association,
there
is
a
distinction
between
labeling
and
misbranding.
what
nimpa
argues
in
its
amicus
brief
is
that
the
term
of
labeling
has
swallowed
up
the
term
misbranding
and
is
almost
direct
quote
“labeling
includes
misbranding.”
but
if
that
is
the
case,
then
how
do
respondents
and
respondent’s
amici
solve
the
problem
of
misbranding
including
definitions
of
things
other
than
labeling.
for
example,
601
and
5
of
21
u.s.c
--
601
and
of
21
u.s.c.
also
says
that
package
is
misbranded
if
its
deceptively
filled,
that
is
clearly
not
a
labeling
requirement.
so,
there
is
a
distinction
between
labeling
and
branding,
something
that
we
discuss
in
further
detail
in
our
brief
and
that
same
distinction
applies
to
15
u.s.c.
section
1461
under
the
fair
packaging
and
labeling
act.
finally,
let
me
respond
the
question
which
was
asked
before
is
preemption
the
only
grounds
upon
which
we
are
to
reversal?
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
assuming
that
federal
law
does
not
require
accuracy
a
time
of
retail
sale
and
assuming
that
this
court
would
otherwise
or
thereby
hold
that
there
is
an
impermissible
conflict
between
the
state
and
federal
laws,
it
is
amici’s
contention
that
this
court’s
decision
last
june
after
we
filed
our
amicus
brief,
the
national
league
of
cities
versus
usery
still
compels
reversal
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision.
the
ninth
circuit's
reasoning
is
that
the
states
may
not
exercise
our
sovereign
police
power
to
protect
our
business
and
consumer
purchasers
against
deception
in
the
sale
of
food
product.
mr.
allan
j.
goodman
yes
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
allan
j.
goodman
mr.
justice
stewart,
what
section
678
of
wholesome
meat
act
says
marking,
labeling
and
packaging
of
ingredients
may
not
be
imposed
by
any
state.
the
state
is
in
a
business
of
assuring
true
weight
at
retail
has
always
been
that
is
historic
police
power
recognize
--
mr.
allan
j.
goodman
no
your
honor,
it
doesn’t
necessarily
follow
this
case
is
even
even
easier
than
usery
because
in
this
case,
the
activity
engaged
in
by
the
state
is
the
activity
of
a
sovereign
power.
this
is
the
power
which
in
turner
versus
maryland
--
mr.
allan
j.
goodman
no
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
don’t
think
so.
the
activity
of
the
state
here
is
an
activity
that
can
be
engaged
and
only
by
a
state.
mr.
allan
j.
goodman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
allan
j.
goodman
let
me
return
then
in
response
to
your
honor's
question.
let
me
return
then
to
great
atlantic
and
pacific
tea
company
versus
cottrell
in
which
the
court
again
held
that
the
state
of
mississippi
could
enforce
it’s
own
more
stringent
laws
with
respect
to
the
adulteration
of
milk
products
and
let’s
discuss
the
respondent’s
argument
in
this
case
in
light
of
that
decision.
we
know
that
in
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
and
in
the
wholesome
meat
act
the
terms
adulteration
and
misbranding
are
statutorily
linked.
thus
in
section
408
of
wholesome
meat
act,
it
says
that
states
may
enforce
adulteration
or
misbranding
requirements
so
long
as
they
are
consistent
with.
the
respondent’s
contention
is
that
they
cannot
be
held
accountable
for
the
standard
of
the
product,
the
quality
of
the
product,
the
contents
of
the
product
at
the
time
it
leaves
the
shipping
dock.
what
that
means
is
that
applies
not
only
to
net
weight
which
was
the
question
presented
in
this
case,
but
to
bacteriological
standards
as
well.
and
thus,
if
they
cannot
be
required
to
have
true
weight
at
retail,
then
can
they
be
required
that
wholesomeness
of
retail.
we
submit
to
answer
that
question
is
all
three
federal
statutes,
excuse
me,
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
and
wholesome
meat
act
require
wholesomeness
at
retail
as
well
the
issue
in
this
case
turns
on
a
question
of
whether
we
are
going
to
revert
to
a
standard
of
wholesomeness
when
packed
as
opposed
to
wholesomeness
at
retail.
thus,
under
the
language
of
anp
versus
cottrell,
the
state
has
a
concern,
an
interest,
a
need
to
require
true
weight
and
wholesomeness
retail
and
moreover
so
does
the
federal
government
and
that
is
why
the
three
federal
statutes
must
be
interpreted
as
requiring
true
weighted
retail.
mr.
allan
j.
goodman
that
is
--
mr.
allan
j.
goodman
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
i
appreciate
the
court
pointing
that
out
because
in
this
case,
there
is
no
commerce
clause
question
because
the
respondents
have
not
cross
petitioned.
but
the
language
of
this
court
in
cottrell,
we
believe
it
does
stand
for
the
proposition
that
there
is
an
inherent
interest
on
the
part
of
the
states
in
requiring
true
weight
retail.
let
me
in
closing
to
make
one
other
point
and
that
is
in
the
solicitor
general’s
brief,
they
refer
to
the
proposed
revision
of
handbook
67
and
lodged
that
with
the
court.
one
of
the
statements
in
handbook
67,
one
of
the
conclusions
of
the
author
that
would
by
the
national
bureau
of
standards
is
that
the
present
packaging
practice
is
for
packagers
to
overfill
between
70%
to
90%
of
their
product.
that
appears
in
the
handbook
which
has
been
lodged
on
page
12.
the
present
packaging
practice
of
industry
is
to
over
pack.
in
conclusion,
we
contend
that
for
each
of
the
reasons
set
fourth
in
our
brief
and
as
discussed
today
with
certain
gravity
that
ninth
circuit
decision
ought
not
to
be
reversed.
what
respondent
seek
is
a
rule
that
short
weight
by
their
interpretation
of
the
reasonable
variations
provision
that
short
weight
packages
must
remain
on
sale
and
that
overweight
packages
must
be
removed
from
sale.
and
thus
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
one
of
the
reason
why
the
state
law
was
less
stringent
than
the
federal
law
was
because
we
did
not
require
enforcement
action
against
overweight
packages
and
it’s
our
contention
and
set
forth
more
fully
in
our
brief
that
that
simply
doesn’t
make
good
enforcement
sense,
it
is
very
expensive
to
the
packer
that
doesn’t
do
anyone,
any
good.
mr.
allan
j.
goodman
no
your
honor,
but
the
problem
if
i
may
say
so
in
this
case
is
that
that
court
granted
petition
for
certiorari
number
1053,
but
did
not
and
they
still
holding
the
petition
number
1052.
mr.
allan
j.
goodman
we
have
not
abandoned
those
arguments
your
honor.
i’m
course
of
the
principle
author
of
the
brief
and
the
court
has
simply
not
acted
upon
it
--.
mr.
allan
j.
goodman
i’m
sorry
you
honor.
mr.
allan
j.
goodman
it’s
an
interesting
procedure
of
posture
in
this
case
your
honor.
there
were
in
fact
two
complaints
filed
to
the
district
court.
the
rath
versus
becker
action
upon
which
1052
is
based
proceeded
through
a
trial
after
objectives
remain,
after
writ
was
taken
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
was
denied
on
the
jurisdictional
question.
and
this
action,
although
file
was
not
served
until
after
the
trial
in
becker
so
that
it
would
be
possible
i
suppose
for
the
court
to
--
mr.
allan
j.
goodman
well,
your
honor,
that’s
not
the
only
issue
looking
in
this
case.
in
fact,
we
have
some
evidentiary
problems
which
are
--
mr.
allan
j.
goodman
yes,
yes
your
honor
and
it
is.
but
your
honor,
i
like
me
to
respond
--
mr.
allan
j.
goodman
no
your
honor,
we
have
(voice
overlap)
we’d
certainly
do
not
want
to
that
same
question
come
up
with
subsequent
cases.
thank
you
very
much.
