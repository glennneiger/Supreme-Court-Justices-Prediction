justice
thurgood
marshall
attorney
goodman,
if
you
crank
it
up
a
little
higher,
you
get
that
mic
--
no,
you
see
on
the
side
that
--
the
other
way.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
federal
law
governing
net-weight
labeling
of
packages
bacon
and
flour
preempts
california
law
in
the
same
subject.
the
petitioner,
the
director,
department
of
weights
and
measures
in
riverside
county,
california
is
charges
enforcing
the
state
law
with
the
ninth
circuit
held
to
be
preemptive.
california
law
prohibits
sale
of
packing
food
commodities
if
they
are
contained
in
lots
whose
average
net
weight
at
the
time
of
sale
is
less
than
the
weights
stated
on
the
label.
in
contrast,
the
federal
law
governing
bacon
requires
an
accurate
statement
of
the
quantity
and
content
in
terms
of
weight
but
allows
reasonable
variations.
the
federal
law
applicable
to
flour
makes
the
same
allowance
for
reasonable
variations.
since
california
uses
a
statistical
averaging
procedure
to
determine
the
average
weight,
its
law
as
enforced
implicitly
allows
for
variations
caused
by
manufacturing
practices.
it
makes
no
allowances
however
for
weight
loss
from
loss
of
moisture.
the
federal
wholesome
meat
act
which
applies
to
bacon
explicitly
preempts
state
labeling
requirement
different
than
those
imposed
by
the
act.
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
conclude
that
the
california
law
imposed
a
labeling
requirement
which
is
different
than
the
federal
requirement
because
the
state
makes
no
allowances
for
reasonable
variations
caused
by
the
laws
of
moisture.
the
state
law
therefore
is
preempted
by
the
expressed
language
of
the
wholesome
meat
act.
the
federal
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
which
along
with
the
federal
fair
packaging
and
labeling
act
governs
net-weight
labeling
of
flour
contains
no
preemptive
language.
and
although
the
packing
act
does
preempts
state
laws
that
are
less
stringent
than
or
require
information
different
from
the
packaging
act,
we
conclude
that
the
state
law
does
not
fall
within
that
language.
nevertheless,
the
california
law
is
preempted
because
it
stands
as
an
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
and
execution
of
the
full
purposes
and
objectives
of
congress.
without
purposes
to
ensure,
the
consumers
are
able
accurately
to
compare
the
values
of
consumer
commodities.
under
the
federal
statutory
scheme,
this
purpose
is
furthered
because
all
packages
contained
the
same
amount
of
flour
solids
were
packed
and
sold.
they
variant
weight
only
because
of
gain
or
loss
non-negative
moisture
content.
under
the
state
law,
however,
packages
was
been
taken
different
amounts
of
flour
solids
when
packs
and
sold
and
consumed
by
comparisons
would
be
distorted.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
was
affirmed.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
into
part
concerning
the
bacon
and
dissenting
into
flour
part.
in
this
opinion,
mr.
justice
stewart
joins.
