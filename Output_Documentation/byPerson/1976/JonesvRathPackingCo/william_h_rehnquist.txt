each
of
these
errors
mr.
kier,
i
take
it
is
in
the
context
of
the
same
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
in
saying
there
was
preemption?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
sovereign
power
imposing
regulations
on
private
individual
that
not
acting
for
its
self,
isn’t
it?
we
didn’t
say
--
we
didn’t
say
in
national
league
of
cities
that
the
federal
law
governing
wages
couldn’t
preempt
state
law
governing
wages,
where
you’re
talking
about
applying
at
the
private
and
the
private
concerns
and
isn’t
that
what
you
have
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we’ll
regulating
people?
