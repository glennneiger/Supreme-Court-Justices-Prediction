mr.
loyal
e.
keir
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
begin
my
discussion
of
the
petition’s
contentions,
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
an
error
that
appears
in
petitioners
reply
brief
and
i
invite
the
court’s
attention
particularly
to
page
8
of
the
reply
brief
where
we
have
quoted
a
portion
of
handbook
67
and
i’m
looking
down
towards
the
bottom
of
page
which
starts
with
the
words,
“it
is
admitted
that
such
indefinites
and
so
forth.”
actually,
that
quotation
ends
in
the
middle
of
the
sentence
and
we
think
this
was
a
publishers
or
printing
error
and
the
full
quotation
actually
appears
in
the
appendix
to
the
amicus
curiae
brief
of
33
states
that
was
filed
in
support
of
the
petition.
i’m
referring
to
the
amicus
curiae
brief
that
is
the
first
one
filed
by
the
several
states.
there
was
a
later
one
filed
concurrently
with
the
petitioner’s
opening
brief
and
at
page
--
mr.
loyal
e.
keir
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
loyal
e.
keir
i
was
going
to
suggest
your
honor
that
i
would
right
a
letter
to
the
clerk
and
set
forth
the
complete
quotation
so
that
we
can
correct
the
record
if
that
is
okay.
this
is
a
case
which
comes
to
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
right
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
involves
the
enforcement
of
a
california
statute
and
california
regulations
pertaining
to
the
weights
and
measures
of
packaged
commodities.
actually,
we
have
two
separate
but
related
cases
here,
namely
the
rath
packing
company
case
which
involves
packaged
bacon
and
the
general
mills
case
which
involves
packaged
wheat
flower.
although,
there
were
a
number
of
issues
that
were
decided
by
the
lower
courts
the
principle
holding
of
both
united
states
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
that
the
california
statute
and
its
interpreter
regulation
are
preempted
by
federal
law,
more
specifically,
the
federal
wholesome
meat
act
of
1967
in
the
rath
packing
company
case
and
the
federal
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
and
the
federal
fair
packaging
and
labeling
act
in
the
general
mills
case.
the
issue
of
preemption
is
the
only
issue
that
petitioner
has
raised
in
the
petition
to
this
court.
in
discussing
the
inspection
process
that
is
followed
by
petitioner
and
other
enforcement
officers
in
california,
i
should
first
define
a
term
that
will
be
used
during
the
course
of
the
oral
argument.
this
is
the
term
“lot.”
a
lot
maybe
defined
as
a
group
of
apparently
identical
packages
found
at
the
same
place
and
at
the
same
time.
for
example,
500
packages
of
wheat
flower
found
in
a
--
on
a
shelves
of
a
safeway
store
on
a
certain
date,
each
package
stating
that
it
contains
10
pounds
net
weight.
now,
this
is
a
lot.
the
inspection
process
that
is
followed
by
the
inspection
officers
in
california
does
not
involve
inspection
of
each
package
in
a
lot.
obviously,
that
would
be
too
expensive
and
too
time
consuming.
instead,
under
the
california
system
in
article
5
is
how
we
ordinarily
refer
to
the
california
regulation,
provides
for
lot
averaging
and
this
is
done
through
random
sampling.
for
example,
in
the
example
that
i
gave
in
the
lot
of
500
packages,
the
inspection
officer
would
select
25
samples
and
he
would
take
them
from
various
parts
of
this
lot
so
that
he
would
get
a
group
of
representative
samples
of
the
lot.
these
are
taken
at
random.
these
packages
are
weighed
and
the
net
weight
of
the
average
is
determined.
if
that
net
weight
is
equal
to
or
more
than
the
labeled
weight,
then
the
entire
lot
is
approved.
if
the
lot
average
net
weight
is
less
than
the
labeled
weight,
then
the
entire
lot
is
ordered
off
sale.
now,
this
system
that’s
followed
in
california
is
a
statically
valid
system
and
it
has
so
been
held
by
united
state
district
court.
one
of
the
basic
defenses
that
has
been
raised
by
the
respondents
is
that
the
california
system
does
not
provide
for
reasonable
variations,
that
is
variations
cause
by
discrepancies
in
manufacturing
processes
or
gain
or
loss
of
moisture
during
the
course
of
good
distribution
practices.
however,
we
wish
to
respond
to
this
argument
and
that
is
that
the
california
system
does
provide
for
reasonable
variations
and
that
these
variations
are
taken
into
account
through
the
lot
averaging
system.
in
other
words,
variations
are
inherent
by
the
very
use
of
the
lot
averaging
system.
although,
there
is
no
specific
mention
in
the
california
regulation
as
to
variations
caused
by
loss
or
gain
of
moisture,
variations
under
the
state
system
can
be
for
any
reason
or
for
all
reasons.
we
must
emphasize
that
contrary
to
what
the
respondents
would
have
the
court
believe,
reasonable
variations
do
not
mean
shortages
below
the
lot
average.
this
warning
was
clearly
set
out
in
handbook
67,
published
by
the
national
bureau
of
standards
of
the
department
of
commerce
and
handbook
67
states
that
this
is
the
basic
requirement
of
the
national
conference
of
weights
and
measures
and
of
the
food
and
drug
administration.
we
would
submit
to
this
court
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
made
three
basic
errors.
to
the
extent
the
time
permits,
i
will
discuss
one
of
the
errors
and
mr.
goodman
will
discuss
the
other
two.
the
first
one
or
the
first
error
is
the
determination
by
the
court
with
regard
to
the
time
when
accuracy
of
weights
and
measures
is
to
be
determined.
the
second
error
is
in
the
court’s
interpretation
of
the
concurrent
jurisdiction
provisions
in
section
408
of
the
wholesome
meat
act
which
maybe
found
in
title
xxi,
section
678.
and
thirdly,
the
error
by
the
court
in
its
interpretation
of
the
provisions
of
the
fair
packaging
and
labeling
act
insofar
as
it
related
to
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act.
in
this
connection
i
refer
specifically
to
title
xvi,
section
1461.
mr.
loyal
e.
keir
that
is
correct
your
honor.
all
three
of
these
errors
deal
strictly
with
the
issue
of
preemption.
i
go
now
to
the
first
error
which
we
assert
was
committed
by
the
ninth
circuit,
and
that
is
in
its
determination
as
to
the
time
when
accuracy
of
weights
and
measures
is
to
be
determined.
and
that
is
according
to
the
ninth
circuit
is
the
time
of
packaging
of
the
product.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
amicus
curiae
brief
filed
with
this
court
agrees
with
the
ninth
circuit
that
time
of
packaging
is
the
key
time.
interestingly
enough,
however,
the
respondents
contrary
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
solicitor
general
maintain
that
the
proper
time
for
determining
accuracy
is
the
time
of
shipment.
petitioner
contends
that
the
state
standard
is
the
time
of
sale
to
the
consumer,
that
this
is
the
only
correct
standard
and
it
is
the
only
standard
that
can
be
correctly
identified
with
the
interest
of
the
consumer.
surely,
we
would
be
hard
pressed
to
find
even
one
consumer
who
--
when
he
picks
up
a
food
package
in
the
supermarket
and
looks
at
the
label,
would
think
to
himself
that
this
label
speaks
as
of
the
date
of
packaging
or
as
the
date
of
shipment
from
some
distant
shipping
point.
the
natural
thing
for
a
consumer
to
think
to
himself
when
he
examines
the
package
and
looks
at
the
label
is
that
the
label
speaks
to
me
now.
mr.
loyal
e.
keir
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
loyal
e.
keir
that
is
correct.
mr.
loyal
e.
keir
well,
they
were
referring
to
the
federal
standard.
mr.
loyal
e.
keir
i
plan
to
come
to
that,
your
honor.
our
position
here
is
that
the
time
of
sale
is
not
only
the
state
standard,
but
is
also
the
federal
standard.
this
is
the
part
of
what
i
purpose
to
urge
upon
this
court.
mr.
loyal
e.
keir
well,
i
propose
to
--
mr.
loyal
e.
keir
i
propose
to
urge
upon
the
court,
your
honor
that
the
standard
which
we
submit
here,
namely
the
standard
of
accuracy
at
time
of
sale
is
not
only
the
state
standard
but
is
also
the
federal
standard
and
that
both
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
solicitor
general
are
in
error
in
their
conclusion
that
the
time
of
packaging
is
the
federal
standard.
mr.
loyal
e.
keir
the
ninth
circuit
determined
that
the
time
of
packaging
is
the
correct
time
not
because
the
federal
statute
stated
that,
but
because
this
was
the
conclusion
of
the
ninth
circuit.
and
the
solicitor
general
agreed
with
it.
as
i
stated,
the
respondents
on
the
other
hand
disagree
with
both
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
solicitor
general
and
they
claimed
that
the
correct
time
is
the
time
of
shipment.
mr.
loyal
e.
keir
petitioner
is
trying
to
urge
upon
this
court
what
is
the
proper
time
for
determining
accuracy
of
weights
and
measures
and
as
we
develop
our
argument,
we
intend
to
present
to
the
court
the
proposition
that
this
principle
of
having
accuracy
of
weights
and
measures
at
the
time
of
sale
to
the
consumer
is
a
standard
which
is
both
a
state
standard
as
well
as
the
federal
standard.
mr.
loyal
e.
keir
yes.
mr.
loyal
e.
keir
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
loyal
e.
keir
well
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
mr.
goodman
and
i
are
sharing
our
time.
i
will
now
fill
to
mr.
goodman.
