alright.
i
don’t
like
to
bit
of
that
horse,
but
the
question
in
this
case
isn’t
which
time
is
the
proper
time
from
the
point
of
view
which
is
the
best
policy
and
which
time
is
the
best
policy
required
that
would
be
measured,
but
rather,
what
does
the
federal
standard
require
and
what
does
the
state
standard
require,
that’s
the
question
isn’t?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
there
are
different
in
this
federal
preemption
that's
if
they
are
different
in
compatible,
then
there
is
a
federal
preemption,
regardless
of
the
wisdom
of
it,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
the
national
league
of
cities
decision
might
be
very
relevant
and
even
persuasive
here
if
were
the
state,
they
run
the
business
of
producing
and
selling
the
bacon
or
the
flower,
or
it
isn’t?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
accept
the
argument,
one
could
just
forget
the
preemptive
affect
of
the
federal
law?
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
state
or
--
in
our
society
by
the
state
government
or
by
the
local
government
or
by
the
federal
government
if
whatever,
but
it’s
pretty
well
accepted
that
if
there’s
incompatibility,
then
the
federal
regulation
preempts
the
others?
