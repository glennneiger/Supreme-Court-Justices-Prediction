where
--
what
page
is
that,
the
title
vii
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
so
what
--
then
what
--
it
begins
on
page
191,
didn’t
it
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
proceed
to
that,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
that
the
court
of
appeals'
order
that
the
seniority
be
given
even
though
that
seniority
might
have
the
beginning
of
employment
might
have
antedated
the
enactment
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
justice
potter
stewart
let’s
say
somebody
was
hired
in
1960.
he
was
given
seniority
beginning
with
1960?
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
effective
date
of
this
act.
justice
potter
stewart
so
your
point
is
that
that
it’s
possible
to
hypothesize
a
case
where
there’s
just
been
no
new
hiring
since
1964
and
so
you’d
look
at
the
labor
force
1975
and
see
that
was
all
white,
but
that
wouldn’t
be
any
evidence
whatever
of
a
violation
of
1964
act?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
weren’t
horrible
so
far
as
the
federal
law
went
--
putting
aside
to
section
1981,
prior
to
1964,
were
they?
justice
potter
stewart
and
whether
they
(voice
overlap)
in
some
people’s
opinion,
but
they
were
certainly
were
not
illegal,
were
they?
justice
potter
stewart
there
were
few
minority
people,
if
any,
who
worked
on
the
road
is
what
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
do
you
say
--
did
you
just
tell
us,
had
claims
of
actual
discrimination
in
your
view?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
were
all
even
in
the
government's
view,
they
were
all
employees
of
this
employer,
weren’t
they?
justice
potter
stewart
none
of
them
was
the
--
there’s
no
plaintiffs
here
who
claim
discrimination
in
that
they
were
not
hired
at
all,
are
they?
justice
potter
stewart
and
all
of
the
employees
of
this
dependent
employer?
justice
potter
stewart
had
to
be
have
--
there
has
to
be
a
vacancy,
doesn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
your
parties
to
this
case
are
not
parties
to
the
next
companion
case?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
holding
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
is
--
is
that
the
class?
justice
potter
stewart
they’re
all
present
employees
in
the
class.
justice
potter
stewart
quite
unlike
franks?
justice
potter
stewart
page
what?
justice
potter
stewart
in
franks
case
where
there
was
no
transfer,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
of
course
a
lot
of
these
as
i
say
they
are
or
all
of
them
are
presumably
are
not,
they
are
not
negro,
they,
they’re
white
or
brown?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they’re
employed,
they
were
employed
prior
to
1965,
so
presumably
they
were
not
discriminated
against
in
their
employment,
by
hypothesis?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
the
government’s
position
that
those
who
were
prevented
from
transferring
prior
to
1965
are
covered?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
before.
justice
potter
stewart
after
1965.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
was
no
discrimination
there
which
will
hire
them
by
definition?
justice
potter
stewart
first,
i'm
authorized
to
announce
the
opinion
and
judgment
of
the
court
in
number
75-636
and
a
related
case,
international
brotherhood
of
teamsters
against
the
united
states.
these
cases
are
hereby
reason
of
the
grant
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
united
states
brought
this
litigation
under
title
7
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
against
the
petitioners
who
are
a
nationwide
trucking
company
and
a
union
that
represents
a
large
number
of
that
company's
employees.
the
government
charged
that
the
company
had
engaged
in
a
pattern
or
practice
of
discrimination
in
employment
against
negroes
and
spanish
surnamed
american
citizens.
these
minority
workers
allegedly
were
hired
only
for
lower
paying,
less
desirable
jobs
as
servicemen
and
city
drivers
and
were
excluded
from
jobs
as
over
the
road
or
line
drivers.
the
government
further
claimed
that
the
seniority
system
agreed
upon
by
the
company
and
the
union
and
their
collective
bargaining
agreements
is
illegal.
under
that
system,
a
city
driver
or
serviceman
who
transfers
to
a
line
driver
job
must
give
up
his
accrued
competitive
seniority
and
start
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
as
a
line
driver.
the
government
claimed
that
this
system
is
illegal
because
it
requires
minority
workers
who
were
previously
excluded
from
line
driver
jobs
to
start
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
when
they
do
get
such
jobs,
thus,
perpetuating
past
discrimination.
the
district
court
after
trial
agreed
that
the
company
had
discriminated
against
negroes
and
spanish
surnamed
person
in
hiring
line
drivers
and
agreed
that
the
seniority
system
is
unlawful.
it
enjoined
the
company
and
the
union
from
committing
further
violations
of
title
7
and
order
that
minority
city
drivers
and
servicemen
at
terminals
with
line
driver
operations
be
given
the
opportunity
to
transfer
to
a
line
driver
jobs
with
retroactive
seniority
to
be
awarded
depending
on
the
strength
of
the
evidence
introduced
to
trial
on
behalf
of
particular
employees.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court's
basic
conclusions
but
it
held
that
every
minority
worker
whether
or
not
he
had
ever
applied
for
a
line
driver
job
should
be
allowed
to
transfer
to
such
a
job
with
retroactive
seniority
back
to
the
time
when
a
job
vacancy
existed
and
the
worker
would
have
met
the
line
driver
qualifications.
the
company
and
the
union
both
sought
review
in
this
court,
claiming
that
the
government
did
not
adequately
proved
that
there
had
been
a
pattern
or
practice
of
discrimination
against
negroes
and
spanish
surnamed
americans
that
the
seniority
system
is
entirely
legal
under
the
civil
rights
act
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
have
awarded
relief
to
anyone
who
had
never
applied
for
a
line
driver
job.
we
granted
their
petitions
for
certiorari
and
a
written
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
have
concluded
as
follows.
first,
the
government
sustained
its
burden
of
proving
that
the
company
had
regularly
and
intentionally
treated
minority
employees
less
favorably
than
white
employees.
the
evidence
showed
pervasive,
statistical
disparities
between
the
employment
of
white
and
minority
employees,
including
the
fact
that
the
company
with
over
1800
line
drivers
had
hired
only
one
negro
line
driver
up
until
the
year
1969.
the
statistical
evidence
together
with
considerable
testimony
of
specific
instances
of
discrimination
was
not
rebutted
by
the
company
and
it
fully
supported
the
findings
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
second,
we
hold
that
the
company
seniority
system
does
not
violate
title
7.
by
virtue
of
§703(h)
of
the
statute,
a
bona
fide
seniority
system
does
not
become
unlawful
simply
because
it
may
perpetuate
prior
discrimination.
congress
as
it
is
clear
from
the
language
and
the
legislative
history
of
§703(h)
did
not
intend
to
make
it
unlawful
for
employees
with
vested
seniority
rights
to
continue
to
exercise
those
rights
even
at
the
expense
of
the
those
discriminated
against
in
the
past.
since
this
seniority
system
applies
equally
to
all
employees
and
was
not
established
or
operated
with
an
intent
to
discriminate
against
anybody,
it
is
not
unlawful
under
title
7.
third,
we
hold
that
victims
of
discrimination
occurring
after
title
7
was
enacted
may
nevertheless
get
full
relief
including
retroactive
seniority.
in
light
of
the
government's
proof
of
a
pattern
or
practice
of
discrimination
in
this
case,
every
minority
employee
who
previously
applied
for
a
line
driver
position
is
presumptively
entitled
to
relief
subject
to
a
showing
by
the
company
that
particular
applicants
were
not
the
victims
of
its
discriminatory
conduct.
moreover,
employees
who
did
not
apply
for
a
line
driver
jobs
are
not
necessarily
barred
from
relief.
a
non-applicant
who
proves
that
he
would
have
applied
for
a
line
driver
job
but
for
the
company's
discriminatory
practices
is
entitled
to
be
treated
as
though
he
had
applied
and
awarded
relief
accordingly.
for
the
reason
spelled
out
at
considerable
length
in
the
written
opinion
of
the
court,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
mr.
justice
marshall
joined
by
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
from
the
opinion
of
the
court.
