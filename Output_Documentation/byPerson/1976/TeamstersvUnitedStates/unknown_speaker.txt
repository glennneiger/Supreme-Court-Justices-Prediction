unknown
speaker
do
you
think
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace
--
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
the
government’s
objectives
could
be
obtain
against
the
union
if
the
union
were
a
party
to
the
suit
only
for
the
purposes
of
a
remedy.
i
mean
in
the
sense
that
the
seniority
provisions
don’t
really
get
in
anybody’s
way
until
and
unless
there’s
a
transfer
and
if
the
company
never
transfers,
the
seniority
system,
isn’t
at
fault.
you
really
have
the
problem
with
the
union
only
because
it’s
a
party
to
a
collective
bargaining
contract.
unknown
speaker
so,
why
do
you
have
to
say
that
they
violated
the
act?
unknown
speaker
but
it
doesn’t
make
the
whole
lot
of
sense,
mr.
wallace.
it
stated
that
the
union
violated
the
act
when
the
seniority
system
doesn’t
hurt
anybody,
it’s
the
discrimination.
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
that
--
unknown
speaker
you
say,
you
must
in
order
to
have
a
remedy
against
the
union,
to
keep
it
from
enforcing
the
collective
bargaining
contract,
you
have
to
find
that
it
violated
the
act.
unknown
speaker
by
the
company?
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
find
it
by
both?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
but
must
you
find
a
post-act
violation
by
the
union?
unknown
speaker
i’m
not
saying
they
should
escape
from
from
having
to
modify
the
collective
bargaining
contract.
unknown
speaker
but
the
seniority
problem,
that
perpetuation
doesn’t
even
take
place
until
there’s
been
a
transfer
in
to
the
road
job.
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
it
hasn’t
suppressed
anything
if
the
company
just
never
hired,
will
never
take
a
transfer
from
a
negro
and
suppress
anybody.
unknown
speaker
do
they
support
more
than
the
fact
that
you’re
just
warded
in
having
a
remedy
against
the
union?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
it
true,
mr.
wallace
that
in
some
at
least
of
those
cases,
if
not
of
all
of
them,
there
were
two
elements
that
are
not
present
here.
first,
evidence
that
the
union
itself
had
been
rationally
motivated,
discriminatorily
motivated,
and
secondly
that
the
system
was
one
that
held
people
in
inferior
subordinate
jobs
and
interfered
with
promotion
unlike
this
case
where
these
are
parallel
jobs.
some
people
just
like
people
who
grew
in
liverpool,
half
a
century
ago,
some
of
them
want
to
go
to
sea
and
some
of
them
didn’t.
if
you
went
to
see,
you
got
more
pay
but
you
had
a
different
kind
of
a
life.
this
is
not
a
kind
of
a
promotion,
these
are
side
by
side
jobs,
a
lot
of
the
people
as
you
told
us,
only
half
of
them
if
given
the
opportunity
would
transfer.
so
this
is
different
from
those
cases
in
that
respect
and
isn’t
it
different
also
on
the
respect
that
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
and
no
possibility
of
finding
here
of
any
racially
motivated
discrimination
on
the
union.
unknown
speaker
because
of
a
lot
of
overtime.
unknown
speaker
but
the
city
drivers
can
come
home
at
night.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace
would
you
help
me
on
one
more
thing,
i
know
your
light
is
on.
but
say
you
have
a
black
who
was
a
dockman
for
ten
years,
something
like
that,
a
non-driving
job
then
a
city
driver
for
a
year
at
which
time
he
becomes
qualified
then
because
of
the
discrimination,
he
doesn’t
get
the
line
driving
job
for
several
years.
now
the
rightful
place,
it
seems
to
me,
--
quite
clearly
say
he
should
get
seniority
to
the
time,
back
to
the
date
when
he
was
qualified.
why
should
he
get
seniority
all
the
way
back
to
the
date
of
his
first
employment?
why
doesn’t
that
produce
a
disparity
as
compared
with
white
workers?
do
you
understand
my
question
or
not?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
thought
he
got
--
if
you
do
not
enforce
this
city
driver
versus
line
driver
seniority,
he
gets
company's
seniority
from
the
time
he
was
an
employee,
doesn’t
he,
under
the
decree
of
the
court,
the
decree
that
the
court
of
appeals
ordered?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
they
lifted
this
rule
as
applied
to
him
entirely,
am
i
wrong,
did
i
read
it
wrong?
unknown
speaker
so
he
does
not
get
a
complete
transfer
of
his
company’s
seniority
then?
unknown
speaker
he
might.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand,
if
he
was
qualified
from
the
outset,
yes.
unknown
speaker
is
there
in
the
record
any
figures
about
how
many
vacancies
there
were
from
1965
to
date
or
from
the
date
the
act
went
into
effect
up
till
date
in
terms
of
various
terminals
or
not?
unknown
speaker
so
then
your
answer
to
my
question
is
no?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
it
makes
some
difference,
whether
there
is
or
not
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
wells,
before
you
sit
down,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
was
suggested
to
me
by
my
brother
white.
do
you
suppose
that
even
if
the
courts
were
wrong
here
in
holding
that
the
union
had
in
anyway
violated
the
title
vii,
of
the
1964
act
and
that
you’re
correct,
that
there
was
no
violation
on
the
part
of
your
client
that
nonetheless
the
court
as
a
court
of
equity
might
have
power
to
amend
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
the
extent
necessary
to
make
it
possible
to
remedy
the
violation
on
the
part
of
the
employer
and
to
give
those
entitled
to
it
their
rightful
place?
unknown
speaker
perhaps
it's
of
the
remedy?
unknown
speaker
the
court
was
a
remedy.
unknown
speaker
and
might
it
not
be
true
that
even
though
you’re
wholly
guiltless
of
any
violation
of
title
vii
or
any
other
federal
law
in
this
respect
that
an
equity
court
might
not
be
warranted
in
varying
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
the
extent
necessary
to
give
relief
against
the
violation
by
the
employer?
unknown
speaker
well,
let’s
assume
that
--
i
take
it,
you
prefer
the
district
court’s
resolution
of
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
let’s
assume
that
there’s
no
question
of
what
there
has
been
a
continued
pattern
of
discrimination
by
the
employer
and
that
there
is
a
question
of
working
out
of
a
suitable
remedy
such
as
giving
some
person
some
retroactive
seniority
when
he
transfers
to
the
road.
now,
to
the
extent
that
that
requires
some
modification
of
the
seniority
provisions
of
the
contract,
if
any,
you
wouldn’t
say
that
the
court
couldn’t
do
that
even
though
the
union
didn’t
violate
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
well,
no
one
would
blow
a
home
on
the
side
of
the
contract
unnecessarily,
i
take
it.
if
you
don’t
need
it,
if
you
don’t
need
to
take
it
with
the
contract,
you
would
not.
but
what
if
you
did
have
to?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
now
that
you
have
gotten
on
your
feet,
do
you
agree
you
misread
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
as
--
having
in
mind
the
language
your
opponent
(voice
overlap).
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
think
full
seniority
means
full
seniority
in
other
words,
is
it?
