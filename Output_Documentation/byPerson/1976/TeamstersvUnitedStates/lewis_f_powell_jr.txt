is
that
issue
still
in
the
case?
justice

f.

mr.
wallace,
as
i
visualize
what
would
happen
it
would
be
any
number
of
sort
of
private
litigations
depending
on
how
many
people
applied
and
you’ve
just
said
the
company
would
have
the
burden
of
proving
it
if
it
wished
to
have
said
that
there
had
been
no
discrimination.
would
the
employee
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
he
would
qualify
to
a
drive
over
the
road
or
there’s
any
presumption
on
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
is
where
i
have
so
much
difficulty
with
visualizing
how
the
decree
would
be
implemented.
there
are
four
local
unions,
one
dealt
--
one
included
city
drivers
another
included
clerks
and
another
included
garage
people.
the
clerk
presumably
have
some
difficulty
of
showing
the
qualification
date,
how
would
you
go
about
that
factor?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you’re
the
district
judge,
what
would
you
do?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
who
would've
the
burden,
the
clerk
or
the
company?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
wouldn’t
the
burden
have
to
be
there,
suppose
the
man
comes
in
and
says,
i
was
qualified
and
on
the
february
19,
1966.
the
company
doesn’t
have
any
way
to
refute
that,
does
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
driving
those
enormous
trucks
requires
a
(voice
overlap).
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
you
say
that
the
white
city
drivers
were
included
in
the
class?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
white
city
drivers
included
in
the
class?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
the
lock
--
the
lock-in
transfer
system
would
affect
the
whites
as
adversely
as
it
would
to
blacks,
wouldn’t
it?
if
you
could
transfer
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
wallace,
excuse
me,
is
it
the
government’s
position
that
individual
employer
prior
to
1965
are
includable
in
the
class?
