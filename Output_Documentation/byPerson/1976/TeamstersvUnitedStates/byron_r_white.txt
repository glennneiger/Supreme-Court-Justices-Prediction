oh!
on
seniority,
as
of
the
date
a
person
was
transferred
to
the
road,
the
seniority,
he
would
have
effective
as
of
that
date
would
reach
back
to
how
far
under
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
effective
as
of
the
date
he
actually
--
(voice

there
was
a
vacancy
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
got
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
--
the
top
--
the
30
that
the
district
court
identified
as
having
been
discriminated
against
would
be
in
that
position
under
the
district
court's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
although
they
--
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
district
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now
you
went
back
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he
want
back
to
65,
did
he,
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
30,
for
the
30.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
farther
back
than
60%,
that
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
other
--
the
probable
ones
back
to
71
or
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
about
this
large
group
that
would
go
in
ahead
of
others
of
white
cities,
what
seniority
would
they
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
of
that
date?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
rule
would
be
the
same
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
who
gets
a
--
under
the
court
of
appeals'
view,
who
would
get
the
first
crack
at
the
first
opening?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wouldn’t
it
--
would
that
depend
on
(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
depend
on
their
unit
seniority
or
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
who
gets
the
--
who
occupies
the
first
positions
that
open
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wallace,
suppose
--
i
suppose
if
there
were
400
parties
to
the
suit
or
were
in
the
class
and
it
was
shown
in
the
evidence
that
only
200
had
been
hired
or
there’d
only
been
200
vacancies
in
the
period,
would
all
400
be
entitled
to
some
relief?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand,
but
what
if
there
could
only
have
been
200
acts
of
discrimination
in
the
relevant
period
and
that’s
in
short,
no
more
than
200
people
could’ve
been
excluded
from
a
transfer
or
a
hiring
when
it
come
to
race?
justice
byron
r.
white
why,
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that’s
your
position,
i
have
to
disagree
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
there
were
only
200
vacancy
--
i’m
posting
only
to
the
200
vacancies?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that
and
that
would
make
a
lot
of
sense
if
you
had
400
vacancies,
that
if
there
had
been
400
possible
acts
of
discrimination
in
them
in
a
relevant
period?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
you
got
to
give
them
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wallace,
do
i
understand
that
the
court
of
appeals
on
remand
would
have
permitted
proof
by
the
company
that
certain
people
were
not
discrim
--
in
fact
discriminated
against?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there’s
just
a
question
of
burden
of
proof
on
discrimination,
on
actual
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
once
--
so
the
government
doesn’t
have
to
take
on
the
job
approving
individual
discriminations
but
the
company
can
get
out
of
liability
of
a
certain
people
by
proving
they
weren’t
discriminated.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
the
date
of
employment,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
did
everyone
in
agreement
that
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
union
had
violated
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
do
you
all
agree
the
union
--
how
do
you
all
agree
that
the
courts
said
union
violated
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
union
isn’t
party
to
the
initial
discrimination,
i
gather?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
it
ever?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wallace,
you
would
--
wouldn’t
you
say
that
the
--
if
the
union
violated
the
act,
as
you
said
it
did,
it
would
have
been
liable
and
could
have
been
made
liable
for
back
pay
also?
