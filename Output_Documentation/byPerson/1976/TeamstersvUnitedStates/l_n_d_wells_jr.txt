mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
the
teamsters
union
has
been
found
to
have
violated
the
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
by
only
the
entering
into
and
enforcement
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract
which
provided
seniority
rights
to
employees
represented
by
the
union.
there
is
no
other
evidence
or
nor
is
there
any
other
contention
as
to
any
unlawful
act
by
the
teamsters.
i
want
to
address
myself
to
two
matters
in
this
oral
argument.
one,
is
there
a
violation
insofar
as
teamsters
are
concerned
of
section
703
(c)
which
is
the
provision
of
the
statute
which
defines
a
union
unlawful
activity.
we
say
there’s
not.
then,
i
want
to
address
myself
to
the
question
of
proper
remedy
if
the
employer
has
indeed
violation
--
violate
the
act.
i
want
to
put
it
in
context.
unions
do
not
hire
people,
employers
do.
that
federal
law
for
some
time
has
restricted
unions
with
respect
the
hiring
hauls,
etc.
most
of
t.i.m.e.-d.c.’s
operations
are
in
right
to
work
state
where
there
is
just
flat
prohibition
against
union
doing
anything
and
with
respect
to
hiring
or
allocation
of
employees.
so
the
sole
responsibility
with
respect
to
hiring
and
allocation
is
the
employer.
now,
who
is
this
employer?
he
has
1800
road
drivers
over
the
nation.
he
has
2600
city
people;
dockmen,
hustlers,
city
drivers.
he
has
400
of
those
2600
are
either
blacks
or
spanish
speaking
americans,
i
call
them
browns
as
in
this
argument.
the
400
--
well,
now
let
me
backup
just
a
moment
as
to
what
was
done
below.
there
was
evidence
by
way
of
statistics
that
showed
horrible
statistics.
certainly
as
of
the
time
that
the
act
was
passed
and
very
little
improvement
up
to
1971,
but
some
improvement.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
prior
to
1964,
of
course,
they
couldn’t
have
violated
the
act.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
and
this
of
course
is
not
a
1981
case
and
they
were
not
illegal.
they
were
bad
from
a
moral
point
of
view
certainly
and
they
were
bad
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
the
statute.
we
say,
however,
that
any
statistics
are
to
be
judged
not
as
of
1964
when
the
act
was
passed
or
1965
when
it
became
effective,
but
after
1965
when
it
became
effective
and
the
statistics
here
are
what
the
situation
was
in
1971.
now
they
don’t
mean
anything
unless
you
have
a
baseline
against
which
to
judge
this.
now,
in
addition
to
the
statistics
there
were
some
50
people,
individuals
claimed
to
have
been
discriminated
against
out
of
these
some
400
of
the
minority
people.
and
perhaps
a
few
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
yes
they
were.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
some
may
have
been
in
the
mechanics
unit
but
at
least
they
worked
in
the
city
and
they
didn’t
work
on
the
road
and
there
were
very
few
people
who
did
work
on
the
road.
now
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
they
were
two
or
three
but
minimal
amount.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
well,
counsel
referred
to
those
two
pages
in
the
record.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
the
first
was
a
list
of
some
20
or
30
people
who
they
claim
were
individual
discriminitees.
the
second
is
a
list
of
every
minority
person
who
they
claim
was
a
class
discriminatee.
and
they
claim,
the
government
claims
that
in
as
much
as
there
was
a
pattern
and
practice
of
hiring
and
the
job
allocation
by
the
employer
that
that
rubbed
off
on
everyone
of
the
400
some
odd
blacks
and
browns
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
--
and
they
all
were
victims
of
discrimination.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
yes.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
we’re
--
in
this
case,
at
this
stage
we’re
talking
about
putative
transferees
and
not
about
(voice
overlap).
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
now,
the
area
of
--
the
period
from
1965
to
--
on
was
a
period
of
merger
of
some
of
a
great
number
of
other
freight
lines,
t.i.m.e.-d.c.
was
coming
from
a
little
one
down
in
texas
to
a
big
one
that
went
nationwide
and
they
were
taking
on
other
people’s
rights
and
other
people’s
employees
and
so
it
was
not
a
period
of
hiring
from
the
outside.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
number
of
employees
went
down
when
they
were
merging
into
this
national
situation.
so
as
far
as
the
union
would
use
a
matter
there
were
less
employees
and
a
larger
percent
each
of
minorities
during
this
period.
so
unions
were
certainly
not
on
notice
of
any
gross
disparate
hiring
practice
from
and
after
the
period
of
the
act.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
a
very
little
higher
percentage
on
the
road,
very
few
people
came
on.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
three
or
four
people
mr.
justice
marshall
very,
very
few,
but
they
weren’t
hiring
on
the
road
then
as
far
as
this
record
shows
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
perhaps
two
to
three
but
minimally.
but
it
--
the
point
was
they
weren’t
hiring
and
that
the
statute
prospectively
applies
to
--
requires
that
hiring
and
job
placement
not
be
discriminatory
and
their
statistics
don’t
go
to
that
issue.
but
i
want
against
that
background
for
the
court
to
understand
what
happened
below.
the
district
court
did
what
we
understand
is
the
proper
approach
although
we
don’t
agree
with
some
of
these
findings.
he
looked
at
individuals
and
he
found
that
30
of
them
were
the
victims
of
discrimination.
he
found
that
four
or
five
others
were
probably
discriminated
against,
but
he
couldn’t
be
real
sure
of
it.
there
was
enough
of
an
indication
that
he
was
going
to
give
them
some
relief,
but
less.
he
found
that
six
rate
of
them
just
flat
were
not
discriminated
against.
and
he
found
this
to
the
3400
others
that
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
that
they’re
the
victims
of
discrimination.
now,
he
did
find
that
the
static
--
excuse
me,
that
the
statistics
and
the
30
people
that
he
had
found
out
of
6000
who
were
discriminated
against
did
amount
to
a
pattern
and
practice
and
the
employer,
as
mr.
shuler
has
indicated
had
entered
into
a
consent
decree
which
took
care
of
their
back
pay
obligation
and
which
provided
for
future
injunction
and
provided
for
hiring
on
a
quota
basis,
50-50
and
that
left
for
the
district
court’s
determination
who
were
the
victims
of
the
discrimination
and
what
was
the
remedy
and
he
found
as
i’ve
indicated,
there
were
these
30
some
odd
men,
he
gave
transfer
city
to
road.
he
gave
seniority
from
the
effective
date
of
the
act
with
respect
to
the
smaller
group
that
were
possibly
discriminated
against.
he
permitted
transfer,
but
less
seniority.
with
respect
to
the
large
group
as
to
whom
there
was
no
evidence
of
discrimination,
he
at
first
issued
an
order
saying
you
can
go
to
the
road
along
with
any
white
people
on
a
50-50
basis.
but
then
he
entered
an
amended
order
in
which
he
said,
in
effect,
they
are
--
said
specifically
that
these
three
or
four
hundred
people
go
to
the
road
ahead
of
other
people.
now,
he
did
however
--
we
think
he
erred
in
that
last
instance
but
he
did
focus
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
no,
only
his
amendment
mr.
justice
brennan.
he
said
ahead
of
the
white
city
people.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
and
we
think
this
was
error.
but
we
get
to
the
court
of
appeals,
they
jettison
this
approach
of
individual
discrimination.
they
say
that
statistics
plus
the
individual
findings
here
amounts
to
pattern
and
practice.
and
they
don’t
understand
that
we
have
tried
damage
and
--
by
liability
and
damage
both
below
somehow,
there
originates
in
the
court
of
appeals
some
idea
that
this
is
a
bifurcated
trial
which
it
was
not.
if
you’ll
look
at
pretrial
order,
if
you
look
at
everything
in
the
district
court,
it
was
just
not
bifurcated,
but
the
court
of
appeals
says
a
pattern
and
practice
is
shown
here.
there
is
a
seniority
system
which
perpetuates
that
pattern
and
practice.
everybody
who
is
minority
gets
the
move
to
the
road
to
a
vacancy
and
gets
full
carry
over
seniority
provided
only
that
he
shows
that
he’s
qualified.
now,
we
say
that
there
is
error
in
there.
we
say
in
the
first
place
that
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
under
the
court
of
appeals,
if
a
man
became
the
city
man
in
1950?
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
he
would
have
1950
road
seniority.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
and
while
he
would
go
to
the
next
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
he
would
go
--
next
vacancy
on
the
road,
that’s
correct,
but
then
when
you
set
that
in
the
context
of
the
contract
where
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
--
where
runs
are
up
for
grabs
every
six
months
or
every
year
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
--
he
would
go
to
the
top
of
the
road
list
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
--
under
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
although
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
that
he
was
a
victim.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
however
the
district
court
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
--
specially
found
when
they’d
applied
or
when
they
had
found
that
the
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
--
the
eeoc
charge
or
when
they
adopted
to
go
to
the
road
and
this
--
the
district
court
did
what
was
done
in
the
franks
case
here.
there
was
some
definition
of
when
the
seniority
would
start
and
didn’t
go
clear
back
to
the
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
--
the
first
time
he
went
in
the
city.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
only
to
65.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
yes
sir.
that
--
well,
and
he
went
to
specific
dates
depending
on
what
they
showed
in
most
part.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that’s
correct
and
this
large
group
and
only
as
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
they
would
have
seniority
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
--
of
the
date
they
went
into
the
--
as
they
go
into,
but
of
course
they
block
whites
from
going
in,
now
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
his
principle.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
the
principle
that
they
indicated
was
that
what
the
district
court
had
done
in
focusing
on
individuals
was
error.
that
once
you
find
in
a
pattern
and
practice
case
that
there
has
been
pattern
and
practice
of
discrimination
then
everybody
is
a
victim.
it
has
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
to
find
out
when
the
particular
victims
were
qualified.
now
we
say
nobody
is
a
victim
until
he
proves
that
he
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
i’m
not
sure
they’re
clear
about
that.
they
say
they
didn’t
agree
with
the
a,
b
and
c
(voice
overlap).
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
i
have
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
to
find
out.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
well,
i’d
--
the
court
of
appeals
says
the
whole
works
will
get
all
the
seniority
that
they
had
in
the
city
provided
only
that
they
were
qualified.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
court
of
appeals
didn’t
tell
us
that.
now
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
only
that,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
yes.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
he
didn’t
talk
in
terms
of
his
test.
he
did
not
spell
that
except
as
you
make
derive
it
from
what
his
findings
were
with
respect
to
each
person.
he
had
evidence
that
somebody
had
made
an
application
or
that
somebody
had
filed
an
eeo
charge
or
that
somebody
had
indicated
that
it
was
futile
to
do
so
because
he
--
his
buddy
next
to
him
had
asked
to
go
on
the
road
and
they’ve
been
told
that
he
couldn’t
go
on
the
road.
they
had
specific
evidence
like
that
which
he
geared
to
the
findings
and
he
did
what
you
would
expect
the
transfer
to
do.
he
stated
that
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
sure.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
i
think
that
the
test
is
40
years
of
experience
under
the
labor
act
which
this
court
has
said
is
the
model
on
which
title
vii
was
drafted.
i
think
you
--
anybody
who’s
going
to
show
an
application
or
some
option
to
go
on
the
road,
some
wished
to
be
there
who’s
going
to
show
it
at
a
time
when
they’re
--
he
was
qualified,
who’s
going
to
show
that
there
was
a
vacancy
and
when
he
shows
it
against
the
background
of
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
yes
indeed
as
a
matter
of
fact
following
generally
what
the
court
said
in
mcdonald-douglas
here
or
what
40
years
of
experience
before
the
nlrb
has
indicated.
my
lights
are
flashing
here
if
the
court
please
and
there’s
something
i
really
want
to
get
to
in
my
case
in
chief.
this
union
didn’t
do
a
thing,
but
enter
into
a
seniority
system
which
the
government
now
concedes
is
a
bona
fide
system.
we
take
30-40
pages
in
our
brief
showing
why
its
bona
fide,
how
it
developed
and
so
on.
and
so
we
have
what
everybody
agrees
is
a
bona
fide
seniority
system
and
the
issue
is,
is
it
unlawful
to
apply
a
bona
fide
system
here
when
the
employer
or
if
you
find
that
the
employer
engaged
in
a
pattern
and
practice.
now
we
say
--
we
analyze
it
two
ways.
we
say
number
one
that
pre-act,
it
is
not.
conceivably
there
maybe
problems
under
1981,
but
the
legislative
history
that
this
court
talked
about
in
franks
made
very,
very
clear
that
the
statute
is
prospective
that
they
couldn’t
have
gotten
the
statute
passed
unless
they
had
put
703
(h)
in
the
statute
and
so
it
maybe
unfortunate.
the
congress
may
have
made
a
bad
judgment,
but
the
congress
made
a
judgment.
that
the
seniority
listing
as
of
july
of
19
--
of
june
of
1965
is
the
way
its
going
to
be
and
what’s
going
to
happen
if
--
is
in
prospect
in
--
with
respect
to
the
application
of
this
law.
so
now,
i
address
myself
to
the
period
that
comes
after
the
effective
date
of
the
act.
this
court
in
franks
gave
the
answer
there.
anybody
on
july
3,
1965,
the
day
after
the
act
was
effective,
who
wanted
to
go
on
the
road
could
go
on
the
road
and
this
seniority
system
did
not
stop
it.
all
he
had
to
do
was
ask
and
if
he
didn’t
get
it
and
if
he
could
make
the
showing
that
would
be
required
under
the
criteria
that
i
have
adverted
to,
if
he
doesn’t
get
it
he
has
article
38
in
his
contract
which
gives
him
a
grievance
and
a
contract
remedy.
if
he
doesn’t
like
that,
he’s
got
the
remedy
which
this
court
gave
in
franks
to
go
on
that
road
anytime.
now
if
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
well,
i
can
conceive
of
the
situation
where
there
is
gross
showing
that
--
of
a
discrimination
where
there
may
not
even
have
to
be
a
vacancy.
that
would
go
that
far
although
the
courts
generally
i
think
have
properly
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
no.
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
assume
a
state
of
fact,
but
i
can
assume
a
state
of
fact
where
he
might
do
that,
where
the
fellow
he
was
bumping
out
was
really
profiting
from
the
discrimination,
but
under
franks
as
i
understand
it
you
have
got
an
equitable
problem
in
terms
of
you
got
to
take
some
account
of
the
people
who
were
in
those
jobs.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
he
would
take
the
seniority
that
he
would’ve
had
had
there
been
no
unlawful
discrimination.
now
if
you
applied
on
january
4,
1965,
he
would
take
that
at
such
time
as
there
was
a
vacancy
thereafter
within
a
period
of
time
if
there
was
a
vacancy
and
if
there
were
the
other
criteria
shown.
i’m
sorry
my
time
has
gotten
away
from
me,
i
don’t
want
to
reserve
sometime
for
rebuttal
for
me.
thank
you.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please.
counsel
has
addressed
himself
to
a
quarles
line
of
cases.
quarles
holds
279
f.
supp
517,
a
department
seniority
system
that
has
its
genesis
in
racial
discrimination
is
not
a
bona
fide
seniority
system.
this
system
does
not
have
its
genesis
there.
the
whole
quarles
line
is
based
on
findings
of
union
connivance
with
an
employer
or
with
separate
black
and
white
unions
or
with
the
line
of
progression
seniorities,
none
of
which
apply
here.
now,
mr.
justice
stevens
inquired
as
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
had
done,
i’m
at
page
six
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
just
a
moment,
i
am
at
wrong
page.
i’m
at
page
34
of
that
document.
all
those
on
app.
a,
app.
b
and
app.
c,
that
is
the
entire
list
of
minorities,
are
entitled
to
be
given
an
opportunity
to
bid
on
future
vacancies
in
the
specified
job
classifications
to
which
they
are
allowed
to
transfer
by
the
district
court’s
order
on
the
basis
of
their
seniority
and
if
they
qualify
for
those
jobs
to
be
permitted
to
exercise
their
full
seniority
in
such
jobs
for
all
purposes,
including
bidding
and
layoff.
now
i’m
happy
to
hear
a
counsel
abandon
that
position
today
and
tell
us
if
when
we
get
back
downstairs
and
retry
that
which
we’ve
already
tried,
that
he’s
going
to
let
us
try
other
issues.
but
he
is
not
the
court
of
appeals.
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
one
other
matter
ought
to
be
indicated.
that
is
that
our
contract
does
not
prohibit
an
employee
from
transferring,
i’m
now
on
page
seven
of
that
same
document
and
this
is
the
court
of
appeals,
the
second
paragraph
on
page
7,
nothing
in
the
union
contracts
prohibits
an
employee
from
transferring
between
separate
bargaining
units
at
a
given
terminal
but
he
loses
his
pre-transfer
accumulated
seniority
for
bid
and
layoff.
now
if
i
understood
what
mr.
wallace
had
to
say,
it
was
that
the
distinguishing
feature
between
white
and
black
city
drivers
is
that
black
could
not
transfer.
if
that’s
right,
it’s
this
man,
it’s
the
employer
that
says
i
cannot
transfer.
we
don’t
stop
them
from
transfer.
that
shows
that
it
is
the
discrimination
in
transfer
by
the
employer
that
perpetuates
their
own,
not
the
seniority
system.
any
black
that
is
discriminated
against,
with
respect
to
that
transfer
or
refusal
of
transfer
by
the
employer,
has
his
right
under
the
statute
to
--
and
under
your
frank's
decision
to
be
made
whole.
actually
he
has
more
than
that,
he
has
a
contract
right
under
article
38
of
the
contract
if
he
wants
to
follow
that.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
there
are
some
who
say
they
opted
to
go
on
the
road
who
testified
that
these
options
were
indicated
pre-1965,
at
a
point
when
it
was
not
unlawful
under
this
statute.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
i
do,
your
honor
and
for
long
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
long
prior
to
the
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
i
misunderstood
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
our
union
contract
mr.
justice
marshall
says
that
seniority
begins
from
the
date
of
coming
in
to
the
bargaining
unit.
the
bargaining
agent
for
the
road
driver
has
no
right
to
bargain
under
the
nlra
for
somebody
who
is
outside
the
bargaining
unit.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
so
his
seniority
starts
white,
black,
brown
or
whatever
when
he
comes
in
that
unit.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
i
would
say
that
this
black
man
coming
and
showing
that
he
was
discriminated
against
because
of
his
race
in
entry
into
that
unit,
should
unlawfully
discriminated
against.
the
union
will
support
him--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
any
teamster
union.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
any
teamster
union.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
some
place
in
los
angeles,
there
are
separate
locals,
in
dallas
it’s
the
same
local
and
it
varies
but
any
teamster
union
will
support
white
or
black
in
getting
his
seniority
from
the
date
he
comes
to
work
in
that
unit.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
he
will
come
and
he
will
get
his
seniority
as
“x”
date
as
to
when
he
applied
or
when
a
job
was
open
for
him
and
when
he
was
discriminated
against
and
until
there
comes
a
time,
if
i
may
answer,
if
your
honor
please.
until
there
comes
a
time
of
a
posting
at
the
next
six
months
or
12
month
interval,
he
neither
will
displace
the
other
but
at
the
next
posting
under
the
contract,
whoever
has
the
higher
seniority
at
that
point
will
be
the
fellow
that
gets
the
option
on
the
job.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
it
depends
on
when
he
was
discriminated
against.
if
he
was
discriminated
against
before
the
white
came
to
work,
he
will.
if
he
was
not,
he
will
not.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
yes
sir,
that’s
exactly
the
contract.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
the
--
article
38
of
the
contract.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
oh,
i’m
sorry
sir.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
in
article
38,
may
i
find
it,
i
believe
it
is
in
the
third
volume,
mr.
previant(ph)
is
looking
for
it
now
but
there
is
a
specific
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
here
we
are
on
page
816.
the
employer
and
the
union
agree
not
to
discriminate
against
any
individual
with
respect
to
hiring
compensation,
terms
or
conditions,
etcetera.
now
you
have
to
read
that
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
alright.
you
have
to
read
that,
if
your
honor
please,
in
connection
with
the
seniority
provision
and
in
connection
with
the
grievance
provision
and
you
have
to
look
at
ralph
dickson's
testimony
in
this
record
with
respect
to
what
happened
when
any
employee
claims
that
his
seniority
has
been
denied
and
the
contract
remedy
that
is
available
to
him.
i
assure
you
it’s
there.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
we
don’t
say
that
a
collective
bargaining
contract
is
written
in
stone.
we
do
say
that
it’s
basic,
it
follows
from
a
basic
national
policy
under
the
labor
act,
unions
give
up
some
wages
and
other
condition
sometime
to
get
seniority
and
certainly
a
transfer
can
weigh
equities
but
you’re
not
even
close
to
that
in
this
case.
where
we
are
here
is
as
mr.
justice
white’s
question
may
have
suggested
that
we
are
kind
of
like
a
--
or
should
be
like
a
rule,
19
defendant
in
to
help
the
court.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
to
figure
out
what’s
a
proper
remedy
under
the
contract
to
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
yes.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
i
will
concede
there
may
be
such
cases.
i
will
not
concede
that
this
is
such
a
case.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
district
court
--
well,
i
certainly
prefer
it,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
i
would
not,
however
i
hasten
to
say
here
that
your
honor’s
decision
in
franks
made
very
clear
that
that’s
wholly
unnecessary
that
within
the
four
corners
of
the
contract
and
within
the
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
if
you
have
to,
obviously
a
transfer
has
powers.
thank
you
your
honors,
thank
you.
