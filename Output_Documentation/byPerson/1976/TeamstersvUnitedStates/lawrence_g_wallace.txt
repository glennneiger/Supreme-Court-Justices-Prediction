mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
has
filed
a
single
brief
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
in
this
case
and
the
companion
case
to
be
heard
next,
the
rodriguez
cases.
these
briefs
represent
the
mature
views
of
both
equal
employment
opportunity
commission,
the
department
of
justice.
i
wish
to
apologize
to
the
court
and
to
the
parties
again
that
it
took
as
long
as
it
did
in
light
of
our
other
responsibilities
to
arrive
at
this
position,
but
we
have
been
able
to
file
a
unified
brief
representing
those
views.
now
there
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
have
no
objection.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
your
honor
but
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
had
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
the
rodriguez
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
stating
views
that
in
some
respects
differ
a
little
from
the
views
we’ve
now
stated
in
the
brief
we’ve
filed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
we
have
filed
one
here,
a
joint,
a
joint
brief
in
this
case.
the
teamsters
just
have
filed
a
reply
brief
which
is
still
being
printed
as
i
understand
it.
it’s
been
filed
and
served
in
january
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
now
the
first
thing
to
be
said
about
the
submissions
made
thus
far
is
that
the
fact
that
the
overall
employment
of
t.i.m.e.-d.c.
was
declining
in
the
post
act
years
does
not
mean
that
no
line
drivers
were
being
hired.
to
the
contrary
the
record
shows
that
numerous
line
drivers
were
being
hired
during
these
years.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
under
the
dis
--
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
here,
when
a
vacancy
occurs
it’s
to
be
filled
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
by
a
member
of
the
class
and
in
that
sense
all
400
would
be
entitled
to
the
opportunity
to
fill
each
vacancy
as
it
comes
along,
but
only
one
can
fill
each
vacancy
as
it
arises.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
all
members
of
the
class
would
still
be
presumptively
and
entitled
to
relief
under
this
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
suppose
the
short
answer
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
short
answer
is
that
you
can’t
tell
whether
the
other
200
of
the
400
would’ve
opted
to
make
the
transfer.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
you
can’t,
but
if
you
had
400
in
the
class
discriminated
against,
you
can’t
tell
that
more
than
200
of
them
would've
wanted
to
fill
vacancies
and
our
experience
in
applying
the
relief
given
in
this
decree
is
that
fewer
than
half
of
the
eligible
people
will
actually
opt
to
make
a
transfer
when
a
vacancy
arises.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
you
see,
they
only
needed
200
possible
acts
of
discrimination
against
the
class
of
400.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
presumably
because
200
of
them
wouldn’t
have
transferred
anyway.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that’s
the
experience
that
we
have.
you
can’t
tell
how
many
of
them
would've
wanted
to
transfer.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it’s
theoretically
but
they
don’t
actually
all
get
the
relief
and
they
don’t
--
only
all
opt
for
the
relief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they’re
only
presumptively
entitled.
they’re
entitled
to
a
choice
when
the
time
comes
if
indeed
it
comes
during
their
working
time
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it’s
a
difficulty
that
i
think
what
the
court
put
behind
it
in
the
franks
case
in
talking
about
the
stages
of
trial
or
the
class
action
in
this
context
where
pattern
and
practice
was
established
in
franks
and
then
you
go
back
to
see
whether
individuals
who
are
part
of
the
class
discriminated
against
can
be
shown
not
to
be
entitled
to
relief
because
they
were
not
actual
victims
of
discrimination.
if
that
can
be
shown
that’s
a
burden
of
proof
that
under
franks
has
shifted
to
the
defendants
wants
the
showing
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
do
not
have
a
situation
where
the
court
of
appeals
has
required
prior
applications
from
the
class
discriminated
against
here
for
several
reasons.
in
franks
you
were
dealing
with
people
from
the
public
at
large
who
were
not
employees
of
the
discriminating
company
and
you
had
to
have
some
basis
for
separating
out
a
class
of
individuals
who
were
discriminated
against.
otherwise
you'd
be
into
a
situation
of
possible
allegations
of
people
who
would
have
liked
to
have
a
job
there,
but
didn’t
think
it
was
worth
applying.
here,
you
have
a
pool
of
persons
who
were
working
for
the
company
under
a
situation
in
which
they
knew
the
company
restricted
them
to
certain
jobs
and
excluded
them
from
other
more
desirable
jobs
and
it
would
be
futile
to
apply
coupled
with
the
fact
that
the
separate
lines
of
departmental
seniority
built
in
a
great
impediment
to
risking
their
livelihood
by
transferring
and
going
to
the
bottom
of
the
seniority
role.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they
might
have
known
that
if
they
had
wanted
to
take
on
law
enforcement
responsibilities
of
that
kind
on
their
own.
these
are
not
individuals
who
were
acting
on
the
advice
of
counsel
and
going
ahead
with
what
they
recognized
to
be
the
existing
practice
of
the
company.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
understanding
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
--
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
upheld
here
is
the
establishment
of
a
prima
facie
case
of
disc
--
of
a
pattern
and
practice
of
discrimination
against
the
class
discrimination,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
position
and
in
this
respect
the
court
of
appeals
anticipated
this
court’s
decision
in
franks.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
not
yet
been
rendered
but
if
the
case
was
pending
in
this
court
at
the
time
the
court
of
appeals
acted.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i’m
not
clear
where
the
burden
lies
on
that
under
this
opinion.
the
court
of
appeals
has
specified
how
the
qualification
date
has
to
be
determined.
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
qualification
date
is
the
date
when
the
individual
would've
qualified
for
the
job
from
which
he
was
excluded
for
the
line
driver
job
when
he
would've
had
the
requisite
experience
and
then
the
next
vacancy
in
the
line
driver
job
after
that
time
is
the
qualification
date
and
that’s
the
date
of
seniority
that’s
carried
over,
not
his
date
of
initial
employment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
could
coincide
with
it
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
it
does
not
necessarily
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
should
think
that
there
are
some
burden
on
the
applicant
in
this
situation
to
show
that
he
is
qualified
for
the
job
that
he’s
now
applying
for.
it’s
only
the
time
when
the
vacancy
arises
that
there
can
be
disputes
of
this
kind.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
company
has
his
employment
records.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
qualifications
for
the
line
driver
jobs,
they’re
relatively
minimal.
there
are
certain
amount
of
experience
driving
certain
kind
of
trucks.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
well,
the
city
drivers
have
been
driving
trucks
of
that
kind
or
should
have
had
opportunities
to
drive
which
they
will
now
have
if
--
in
many
instances
line
drivers
have
been
recruited
or
taken
from
the
ranks
of
the
white
city
drivers.
they’ve
been
able
to
get
the
requisite
experience
in
the
course
of
their
work
as
city
drivers
to
the
extent
one's
qualification
has
been
delayed
through
discrimination
of
that
kind
and
not
getting
--
giving
them
requisite
experience,
then
an
estimate
it
has
to
be
made
of
when
he
would’ve
the
requisite
experience
for
purposes
of
computing
a
seniority
carry
over
date.
all
of
that
is
contemplated
by
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
have
cited
in
footnote
38
of
our
brief
on
page
29,
several
depositions
in
the
record
to
that
effect
of
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
and
the
accompanying
text
in
our
--
in
the
statement
of
our
brief,
this
is
page
29
of
our
brief
in
this
case.
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
exclusion
of
minority
employees
from
line
driver
jobs
was
due
to
any
valid
job
requirement.
the
only
significant
requirement
for
a
line
driver
position
was
experience
driving
tractor-trailer
equipment.
that
is
documented
with
footnote
38,
several
depositions
in
the
record.
experience
which
many
of
the
city
drivers
either
had
when
they
applied
for
a
job
at
t.i.m.e.-d.c.
and
there
are
appendix
references
there
or
acquired
as
a
result
of
the
city
driving
and
there
is
another
footnote
with
appendix
references,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
you
would
still
would
have
to
have
it
and
there
was
a
finding
here
that
in
some
instances
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
isn’t
clerks
who
have
been
found
excluded
from
these
particular
jobs.
there
has
been
other
instances
of
discrimination
found
in
this
record,
but
the
main
one
is
keeping
the
city
drivers
from
becoming
line
drivers.
there
have
been
other
kinds
of
discriminations
in
the
training
of
service
people
in
the
national
terminal,
etcetera.
the
main
one
has
been
excluding
the
city
drivers
from
the
line
driver
jobs
and
that
is
what
the
attention
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
focused
on.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
--
the
class
includes
all
persons
who’ve
been
discriminated
against
in
one
way
or
another
and
it’s
whatever
discrimination
was
against
the
individual
that’s
to
be
remedied.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they’re
all
present
employees
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
were
all
incumbent
employees
during
the
time
of
the
discrimination
and
once
the
company
hired
minority
line
driver,
the
first
minority
line
driver
at
one
of
these
terminals
that’s
the
cutoff
date
for
members
of
the
class,
subsequent
employees
are
not
members
of
the
class,
minority
or
majority.
now
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes
--
no
that
is
not
city,
that’s
not
city
drivers.
we
have
city
drivers,
you
ask?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
they’re
the
primary
victims.
we
have
in
the
first
appendix
to
the
district
court's
opinion
--
no,
i’m
sorry,
it’s
appendix
b
of
the
district
court’s
opinion.
no,
i
guess
i
was
right
the
first
time,
appendix
a,
starting
at
page
68
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
starting
at
page
68,
is
appendix
a
and
starting
at
the
bottom
of
page
69,
you
get
by
individual
terminals
that
are
the
main
ones
involved
in
this
litigation
figures
of
black
and
white
city
drivers
and
spanish-surnamed
ones.
you
know,
it’s
the
first
one,
it
happens
to
be
for
hayward
california
outside
of
san
francisco
where
they
were
33
white
city
drivers,
three
negro
and
nine
spanish-surnamed
americans
and
it
goes
on.
there
--
some
of
these
had
a
substantial
number
of
negro
city
drivers
others
had
very
few.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
black
one?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
only
in
the
memphis
terminal
where
there
was
evidence
that
during
a
certain
period
white
as
well
as
black
city
drivers
were
not
permitted
to
transfer
to
line
driver
jobs
for
racially
motivated
reasons
where
they
were
afraid
that
they
wouldn’t
be
able
to
deny
blacks
the
transfer
white
if
--
right
if
they
gave
it
to
whites
so
there
were
white
victims
of
that
racial
discrimination.
and
those
whites
are
members
of
the
class
along
with
one
individual
white
who
was
discriminated
against
in
other
ways
at
the
denver
terminal
because
of
his
support
of
the
racial
discrimination
concerns
of
the
blacks
there.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
they
were
locked
in
--
if
they
were
not
permitted
to
transfer
but
the
--
it
was
only
at
memphis
that
there
was
a
finding
that
the
whites
would
not
permitted
to
transfer.
the
evidence
is
replete
with
examples
of
whites
who
had
transferred
from
city
driver
to
line
driver
jobs.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it’s
my
understanding,
i
haven’t
prepared
that
one
in
detail
for
the
day.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
spanish-surnamed
americans,
yes.
now,
i
do
want
to
say
that
the
record
shows
numerous
instances
of
post
1965
hiring
of
line
drivers
because
some
confusion
has
been
raised
about
that
here
and
because
of
the
size
of
the
record,
the
relevant
portions
of
it
have
not
been
reprinted
in
the
three
volume
appendix
on
file
with
the
court.
but
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
not
only
our
position,
it’s
the
position
of
all
eight
of
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
ruled
on
this
issue
and
it
was
a
matter
that
was
before
congress
in
1972,
when
they
were
aware
of
it
and
reenacted
the
law
with
amendments
that
in
no
way
repudiated
that
and
we
think
showed
their
approval
of
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
were
dis
--
they
were
confined
to
the
jobs
that
were
made
available
for
them.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
they
were
prevented
after
1965
as
well.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
not
that
they
were
--
no,
they’re
not
covered
by
the
act
unless
there
was
an
act
of
discrimination
against
them
after
1965.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
the
seniority
goes
back,
that’s
what
i
meant
that
if
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
the
court
please,
i
think
many
of
the
bits
in
pieces
of
the
case
that
we
have
been
discussing
will
fall
into
place
if
i
proceed
now
to
explain
what
i
see
is
the
basic
difference
between
the
parties
and
that
is,
as
to
what
we,
and
the
courts
below
consider
to
be
the
post
act
violation
committed
by
both
petitioners
with
respect
to
all
members
of
this
class
and
that
adheres
in
the
application
of
the
seniority
provisions
to
transfers
by
these
members
of
the
class,
so
that
they
would
be
locked
in
if
they
attempted
to
move
into
these
jobs,
these
more
desirable
jobs
in
which
they
would
be
--
they
have
been
excluded,
they
would
be
locked
in
to
a
situation
where
they
would
be
forever
behind,
not
only
their
contemporaries
but
persons
who
rightfully
with
be
much
junior
to
them
in
terms
of
service
to
the
company
in
bidding
for
jobs
and
in
layoff
rights
and
indeed
would
have
to
in
many
instances
put
there
economic
survival
on
the
line
because
of
the
possibility
of
layoff
and
the
need
to
forfeit
all
of
the
rights
that
they
had
accrued
through
their
employment
in
the
company.
this
view
of
the
use
of
job
seniority
systems
to
apply
to
persons
who
have
been
discriminatorily
restricted
and
excluded
from
these
jobs,
constituting
a
violation
of
title
vii
is
one
of
the
oldest
doctrines
in
the
application
of
title
vii
recognized
as
i
started
to
say
before
lunch
by
eight
courts
of
appeals
and
without
any
to
the
contrary,
and
in
the
re
enactment
in
1972
by
congress.
it
dates
back
nine

4,

philip
morris
company
decided

circuit
judge
butzner
sitting

court

of

circuit
decision
in
local
189
of
the
papermakers
and
the
unions
in
the
present
case
who
are

principle
parties
of
interest
because
all
monetary
liability
has
already
been
taken
out
of
this
case
by
the
consent
to
query,
the
issue
now
is
seniority
carryover.
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
every
--
as
far
as
i
know,
everyone
is
in
agreement
and
that’s
why
the
union
is
petitioning.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
through
--
being
a
party
to
the
application
of
this
seniority
system
to
keep
these
people
in
a
permanently
disadvantage
seniority
status
which
would
perpetuate
the
prior
discrimination.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
by
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
by
adhering
to
and
enforcing
the
contract.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
only
its
application
to
perpetuate
discrimination.
other
than
that
the
contract
is
--
we
don’t
challenge
the
legality
of
the
contract,
except
as
it
is
applied
to
perpetuate
discrimination
against
the
class
that
was
found
to
be
the
victim
of
discrimination.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
some
instances,
it
may
have
been.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don’t
have
specific
findings
on
that.
here,
that
isn’t
the
legal
issue
as
it
was
viewed
by
the
courts
below.
the
union
is
the
party
to
perpetuation
of
the
discrimination
through
the
application
of
this
seniority
system.
this
is
wholly
a
part
from
discrimination
in
hire.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
holding
against
the
union
is
that
it
has
perpetuated
the
discriminations
through
the
application
of
the
seniority
system.
it’s
not
a
holding
that
the
union
has
discriminated
in
hire.
the
union
doesn't
hire
people,
we
recognize
that.
the
union
argued
that
but
that
has
only
to
do
with
the
holding
in
the
case.
that
is
my
answer.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
some
instances,
it
did,
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
then
in
other
instances
white
city
drivers
did
move
into
the
line
drivers.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
many
instances,
they
did
and
sometimes
they
were
hired
off
to
streets.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
because
if
it
is
continuing
nature.
at
the
time
a
white
would
move,
he
would
have
built
up
relatively
little
seniority
as
a
city
driver,
would
not
be
giving
up
this
much
but
there
was
this
continuing
impediment
while
the
black
city
driver
build
up
many
years
of
seniority
all
of
which
would
have
to
be
forfeited
and
he
didn’t
have
the
opportunity
to
move
when
the
first
vacancy
arose.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
those
whites
who
wanted
to
move
to
line
drive
jobs,
and
have
done
so
relatively
early,
it’s
typical
that
those
jobs
are
taken
relatively
early
in
a
man’s
career
when
he
is
willing
to
go
on
the
road
and
before
he
has
established
his
family,
etcetera,
it
is
a
way
of
life.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
are
seniority
rosters
in
the
record
which
is
not
reproduced
in
the
appendix.
i
was
trying
to
refer
to
before
the
line
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
really.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
because
the
findings
are
that
there
was
a
prima
facie
showing
of
discrimination
by
locking
in
blacks
who
did
not
--
who
wanted
to
transfer
whereas
whites
were
not
locked
in.
if
they
built
up
seniority
as
a
city
drivers,
it
was
because
they
chose
to
not
because
they
were
discriminated
against.
except
in
the
one
instance
at
memphis.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
in
many
instances
did,
so
it
was
a
free
choice
on
the
part
of
the
non-minority
people.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
all
of
that,
it
was
covered
by
the
consent
decree
with
a
maximum
award
of
$1500
to
any
individual
and
some
of
them
receiving
considerably
less,
but
these
people
are
interested
in
its
job
opportunities,
not
financial
windfalls
and
that
the
issue
here
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
and
that
is
the
contested
issue
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that’s
another
question
that
isn’t
in
the
case
now
and
there
are
instances
in
which
unions
are
liable
for
back
pay,
have
been
held
liable
in
other
cases
because
of
their
role
in
perpetuating
a
discriminatory
system
that
--
and
it’s
just
not
the
issue
here.
the
unions
here
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that’s
exactly
what
i’m
trying
to
get
to.
it's
the
same
as
what
the
employer
has
been
found
guilty
of.
applying
this
job,
seniority
system
in
a
manner
that
perpetuates
the
discrimination
of
previously
excluding
these
minority
people
from
the
more
desirable
jobs
so
that
when
they
now
take
the
job,
if
they’re
willing
to
take
it
all,
it
will
be
at
the
price
of
being
permanently
and
forever
subordinated
to
more
junior
people
in
the
company
who
are
not
discriminatorily
excluded
from
the
job
and
in
every
bid
that
they
have
to
make
for
a
job
from
the
board
for
the
rest
of
their
career,
that
discrimination
will
be
perpetuated
and
its
affects
on
their
livelihood.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
the
union
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
collective
agreements.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
perpetuating
this
discrimination,
that
is
correct,
that
is
the
holding
and
that
is
i
say
has
been
the
uniform
holding
of
eight
courts
of
appeals
since
quarles
decision
nine
years
ago
and
i
want
to
go
very
briefly
through
this
chronology
for
the
court
because
the
union
in
this
case
is
saying
that
the
quarles
line
of
decision
should
be
distinguished
as
not
involving
a
bona
fide
seniority
system,
is
involving
seniority
systems
that
were
used
only
for
the
purposes
of
discrimination
and
then
they
refer
in
their
reply
brief
to
a
brief
filed
this
weekend
by
the
afl
cio,
not
in
this
case,
but
in
united
air
lines
against
evans.
the
brief
that
has
not
been
distributed
yet
which
asks
this
court
to
repudiate
the
whole
quarles
line
of
cases
on
the
premise
that
if
the
court
can’t
find
that
they’re
distinguishable
from
the
kind
of
case
we
have
involved
here.
but
the
first
point
is
in
quarles
and
in
many
of
the
subsequent
cases,
the
courts
recognized
that
the
job
seniority
or
departmental
seniority
systems
served
legitimate
purposes
were
not
adopted
solely
for
the
purpose
of
discrimination.
and
i
want
to
just
very
quickly,
in
quarles
itself
refer
the
court
to
279
f.
supplement,
pages
513
and
519,
in
which
those
findings
were
specified
in
quarles
itself.
nonetheless,
the
court
held
that
despite
its
legitimate
aspects
because
it
also
had
this
function
of
perpetuating
discrimination,
it
could
not
be
applied
so
as
to
accomplish
that
result,
but
the
court
was
very
careful
in
quarles
not
to
set
aside
the
departmental
seniority
system
in
its
entirety.
it
preserved
the
system
insofar
as
it
could
be
applied
without
having
this
effect
of
perpetuating
discrimination.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
can
indeed,
that
was
the
next
thing
i
was
about
to
do.
in
local
189
of
the
united
paperworkers,
which
is
the
first
court
of
appeals
decision
on
the
subject,
the
fifth
circuit
and
this
is
to
me
the
key
decision
for
reasons
i’ll
explain
in
a
moment.
the
fifth
circuit
endorsed
quarles
and
adopted
it
in
that
court
of
appeals.
there
are
several
points
that
were
made
here
partly
quoting
the
quarles
decision.
first,
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
references
in
the
legislative
history,
the
preservation
of
seniority
systems.
this
was
all
before
the
1972
amendment,
were
to
employment
seniority
in
general
and
none
of
the
excerpts
in
that
history
referred
specifically
to
departmental
seniority
or
something
that
was
to
be
preserved
and
the
proviso
to
section
703
(h)
expressly
states
that
the
seniority
system
must
be
bona
fide
and
the
rationale
of
these
cases
is
that
to
the
extent
that
application
of
the
system
perpetuates
discriminatory
effects
on
individuals
who
were
discriminated
against.
to
that
extent,
the
application
is
not
bona
fide
within
the
meaning
of
this.
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
too
was
addressed
in
this
case.
there
was
a
specific
portion
of
the
case
devoted
to
the
contention
that
it
was
not
adopted
with
the
intent
to
discriminate,
that
is
roman
numeral
v
of
the
opinion,
beginning
on
page
995
in
416
f.2d.
they
found
unpersuasive,
the
argument,
that
whatever
its
operational
effects,
job
seniority
is
immune
under
the
statute
because
not
imposed
with
the
intent
to
discriminate
and
that
was
largely
on
the
basis
of
the
kind
of
rationale
later
used
by
this
court
in
griggs
against
duke
power
in
talking
about
facially
neutral
or
even
neutral
intent
criteria
that
nonetheless
have
a
discriminatory
effect
as
being
part
of
what
the
act
prohibits.
there
are
two
things
that
the
court
pointed
out
here.
one
is
that
every
time
a
negro
worker
hired
under
the
old
segregated
system
bids
against
a
white
worker
in
his
job
slot,
the
old
ratio
classification
reasserts
itself
and
the
negro
suffers
anew
for
his
employer’s
previous
bias
and
the
other
point
is
quoting
the
quarles
decision,
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
that
the
act
does
not
condone
present
differences
that
are
the
result
of
intention
to
discriminate
before
the
effective
date
of
the
act
and
the
result
doesn’t
mean
that
the
seniority
system
itself
had
to
be
intended
to
discriminate
and
although
such
a
provision
could've
been
included
in
the
act
if
congress
so
intended.
now,
later
in
1968,
the
seventh
circuit
adopted
the
same
rationale,
the
same
holding,
the
same
seniority
carryover,
in
bowe
against
colgate,
palmolive.
in
all
of
these
cases
involved
carryover
of
pre-act
seniority,
including
all
the
ones
i’m
about
to
talk
about.
then
a
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
in
local
189
of
the
united
paperworkers
case
in
which
this
was
the
principal
issue
raised
and
i
looked
at
our
brief
in
opposition
that
we
filed
at
that
time,
i
mean
january
1970,
and
we
did
not
deny
the
importance
of
the
issue,
instead
we
were
able
to
point
out
that
there
were
now
three
court
of
appeals
decisions
unanimously
holding
this
because
the
one
contrary,
district
court
opinion,
which
had
been
rendered
in
north
carolina,
in
griggs
against
duke
power
company,
had
been
reversed
by
judge
borman’s
opinion
for
the
fourth
circuit.
this
was
all
before
griggs
came
to
this
court
in
another
issue
and
we
argued
that
those
decisions
were
clearly
correct
in
their
interpretation
of
title
vii
as
applying
in
this
manner
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
volumes
397
of
the
u.s.
reports.
the
following
term,
griggs
came
up
on
the
testing
issue,
the
other
issue
it
didn’t
even
come
to
this
court
on
this
issue
and
was
later
decided.
then
in
the
course
of
the
1972
reenactment,
the
legislative
history
of
which
is
recounted
in
some
detail,
in
this
court’s
opinion,
in
franks
against
bowman
transportation
company,
these
cases
were
referred
to
in
both
the
senate
committee
report
and
the
house
committee
report.
and
the
principle
that
they
embodied
was
described
in
some
detail.
i
now
turn
to
a
lengthy
footnote
on
pages
764
and
765
of
this
court’s
opinion
in
franks,
424
u.s.
the
principle
that
they
embodied
was
stated
in
some
detail
as
follows;
first,
there
was
a
quote
from
the
senate
committee
report
stating
that
employment
discrimination
as
viewed
today
as
a
complex
and
pervasive
phenomenon,
experts
familiar
with
the
subject
now
generally
describe
the
problem
in
terms
of
systems
and
effects
rather
than
simple
intentional
wrongs
and
the
literature
on
the
subject
is
replete
with
discussions,
for
example,
the
mechanics
of
seniority
and
lines
of
progression,
perpetuation
of
the
present
defect
of
pre-act
discriminatory
practices
through
various
institutional
devices
and
testing
invalidation
requirements.
now,
the
literature
is
replete
with
that,
we
cited
some
of
that
literature
in
our
brief,
three
prominent
law
review
articles
on
the
subject
are
cited
in
our
brief.
i
won’t
bother
with
the
reference
to
them
now.
one
of
them
was
the
1967
note
in
the
harvard
law
review
which
is
the
seminal
one
on
this
issue.
then
the
rightful
place
principle
was
articulated
in
the
conference
report,
it's
true
that
this
first
excerpt
from
the
senate
committee
report,
a
company
that
build
was
changed
with
respect
to
the
changes
being
made
in
the
enforcement
mechanisms
for
title
vii
but
the
substantive
provisions
of
title
vii
were
not
changed
from
the
way
they
were
reported
out
at
that
time
in
any
significant
respect.
the
basic
thrust
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
1972
reenactment
is
that
congress
was
satisfied
with
the
substantive
standards
being
applied
under
title
vii,
but
fell
a
need
to
enforce
the
remedies
and
the
difference
was
whether
that
should
be
through
cease
and
desist
power
or
enabling
the
eeoc
to
sue
in
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
sir
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i’m
not
sure
that
we
have
to
but
that
is
--
because
i’m
explaining,
that
is
the
basic
way
of
interpreting
the
statute
for
the
past
nine
years.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
you
see,
it’s
the
perpetuation
of
the
discrimination,
that’s
a
violation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
otherwise
you
have
to
find
some
other
post
-
act
violation
and
the
courts
have
applied
this
pre-act
seniority,
all
of
these
cases.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
you
have
to
find
a
post-act
violation
of
the
act
--
of
course
by
either.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
has
to
be
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
all
the
company
is
doing
is
adhering
to
the
collective
agreement
and
union
is
the
party
to.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
find
it
hard
to
see
how
the
union
escapes
from
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
right.
so,
if
you
say
the
company’s
adherence
to
the
agreement
is
a
violation
you
don’t
have
to
find
that
the
union’s
adherence
to
the
agreement
is
a
violation
for
title
vii
purposes,
because
i
don’t
see
the
logical
distinction.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it’s
the
impediment
to
transfer,
it’s
the
thing
that
suppresses
people.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
of
course
that
is
a
present
violation,
if
the
company
won’t
do
it,
if
you
got
that
situation,
you
don’t
need
the
contract,
the
contract
is
just
an
additional
violation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it’s
not
an
argument
about
an
effectiveness
of
representation,
it’s
an
argument
that
in
applying
this.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
should
move
on
to
the
application
of
the
seniority
provision
so
as
to
cease
perpetuating
the
discriminatory
effect
on
the
class
that
has
been
discriminated
against.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
should
have
used
less
efforts
to
do
that
and
to
the
extent
it
didn’t,
that
was
the
violation,
that
was
the
violation
held
in
local
189
which
was
a
case
against
the
union.
what
i
need
to
say
on
the
rest
of
this
is
that
the
rightful
place
principle
then
recognized
in
this
legislative
history
had
its
origins
not
in
the
context
in
which
this
court
approved
it
in
franks
against
bowman
transportation
but
in
this
context,
it
was
always
recognized
in
these
early
cases
and
throughout
the
history
of
litigation
under
this
act
as
a
principle
to
be
applied
in
carrying
over
seniority
of
incumbent
employees
when
they
transfer
in
and
the
difficult
question
in
all
of
the
literature
and
all
of
the
cases
was
whether
it
could
also
be
applied
in
the
context
of
franks
against
bowman,
whether
you
could
have
what
was
referred
to
in
local
189
itself
as
fictional
seniority
for
someone
who
didn’t
ever
work
for
the
company,
whether
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
legislative
history
of
the
act.
it
was
always
agreed
in
all
of
these
cases
and
in
literature
that
the
seniority
actually
earned
in
a
company
could
be
carry
over
and
that
was
the
origin
of
the
rightful
place
doctrine,
that
language
was
first
used
in
that
way
in
the
note
in
1967,
harvard
law
review
and
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
local
189
and
when
congress
said
in
1972,
in
any
area,
this
was
a
company
--
the
conference
report,
in
any
area
where
the
new
law
does
not
address
itself
or
in
areas
where
a
specific
contrary
intention
is
not
indicated,
it
was
assumed
that
the
present
case
law
is
developed
by
the
courts
would
continue
to
govern
the
applicability
in
construction
of
title
vii.
it’s
hard
to
know
what
they
possibly
could
have
been
referring
to
other
than
this
line
of
cases
which
was
the
most
prominent
line
of
appellate
cases
at
that
time
and
was
discussed
in
the
three
leading
articles
on
the
subject
at
that
time
were
cited
through
this.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
hold
that
the
union
was
violating
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
many
of
these
cases
do
involve
the
trucking
industry
and
precisely
what’s
involved
here
and
we’ve
cited
all
these
cases
from
all
these
court
of
appeals,
i’m
not
going
to
have
time
to
go
into
them
now
but
the
findings
in
this
case
are
very
clear,
they’re
in
the
district
court’s
opinion
that
the
line
driver
job
was
by
far
the
more
desirable
job,
it
was
the
higher
paying
job,
it
was
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
more
desirable
because
they
didn’t
have
to
load
and
unload
their
trucks
the
way
the
city
drivers
did.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that’s
right.
some
people
might
find
one
more
desirable,
some
may
find
another
more
desirable.
whites
had
their
choice
and
blacks
did
not
and
that
is
the
essence
of
the
discrimination
that
occurred
here
and
if
the
union
perpetuated
and
this
whole
series
of
cases
has
agreed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
he
gets
seniority
from
the
time
that
he
was
qualified
for
a
vacancy
which
existed
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
decree
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
decree
specifies
as
the
qualification
date
for
seniority,
the
date
of
the
first
vacancy
after
the
person
became
qualified
as
an
employee
of
the
company
for
the
job
from
which
he
was
excluded.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
only
insofar
as
it
goes
back
to
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
might.
it
might
be
the
same
thing.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
our
view,
whether
a
white
subsequently
transferring
in
the
same
way
should
be
able
to
carry
over
that
seniority
would
be
a
subject
for
collective
bargaining
now.
there
would
be
no
need
for
the
court
here
to
answer
that
one
way
or
the
other.
whites
who
had
already
transferred
over
could,
if
the
district
court
find
it
equitable
to
do
so,
be
awarded
carryover
seniority
so
as
to
be
able
to
compete
with
the
transferring
minority
city
drivers,
we
took
that
position
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
have
a
whole
freight
case
and
that
relief
was
given
on
remand
over
the
objection
of
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
and
they
say
it’s
not
relief
against
discrimination
but
it
is
part
of
the
equity
power
of
the
court
in
seeing
to
it
that
you
don’t
get
racial
disparities
as
a
result
of
the
relief
that’s
needed
in
these
cases.
and
we
think
that
that’s
a
proper
exercise
of
the
equitable
discretion
and
then
formulating
a
decree
to
this
case
hasn’t
reached
that
stage
yet.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i’m
going
to
use
five
minutes
of
mr.
wells
will
use
five
minutes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
your
honor.
we
were
just
told
that
we
have
not
reached
the
stage
of
the
proceeding
where
certain
types
of
proofs
are
relevant.
we
believe
that
the
government
has
not
faced
this
issue
as
to
whether
we
have
reached
that
stage
in
proceeding,
whether
there
will
be
proofs
put
in
on
the
issue
of
remedy.
there
has
been
no
explanation
by
the
solicitor
general’s
office
as
to
how
the
government
can
proceed
at
trial
on
the
basis
that
all
the
issues
of
liability
and
remedy
are
being
tried
and
now
when
the
circuit
court
comes
out
with
the
decision
that
says
remedy
has
to
be
delayed
to
a
later
time
that
now
the
solicitor
general
says,
we
have
only
tried
liability,
now
we’re
going
to
go
back
some
later
time
to
try
a
remedy.
we
don’t
think
that
is
the
fact
here
and
we
don’t
think
that
has
been
addressed
by
the
government.
the
government
has
also
assumed
certain
things
that
we
do
not
believe
are
true
in
this
case.
there
has
been
an
assumption
that
there
is
a
large
pool
of
white
and
black
city
drivers
from
which
road
applicants
can
be
obtained.
there
is
a
long
list
of
additional
requirements
in
the
appendix,
volume
three,
from
pages
841
to
894
that
show
the
additional
qualifications
that
a
road
driver
must
have
before
he
can
go
on
the
road.
i
would
also
point
out
to
you
that
at
the
trial,
we
showed
through
the
experience
at
our
memphis
terminal
that
when
we
did
transfer
city
drivers
to
the
road
that
we
had
much
more
extensive
damage
and
accidents
attributable
on
a
percentage
basis
to
the
city
drivers
than
to
those
road
drivers
who
had
been
initially
hired
on
the
basis
of
their
prior
road
experience.
so
it
is
not
safe
to
say,
to
conclude
that
city
drivers
automatically
give
you
a
good
pool
over
road
drivers.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
your
honor
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
have
been
some
white
city
drivers
who
have
transferred
to
the
road.
but
the
experience
we
had
at
memphis
involved
as
many,
if
not
more
white
drivers
than
minority
drivers.
the
experience
of
both
of
them
was
bad
as
when
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
bring
up
the
memphis
experience
simply
to
say
that
it
is
not
safe
to
assume
that
city
drivers
make
good
road
drivers.
and
in
memphis,
both
white
and
minority
city
drivers
were
transferred
to
the
road
and
both
the
white
and
the
minority
city
drivers
were
not
good
road
drivers.
they
had
percentage
wise
a
far
higher
accident
ratio
than
white
and
minority
road
drivers
who
came
in
with
prior
road
training.
so
i
am
simply
commenting
on
an
assumption
that
we
think
is
not
valid
here.
in
addition,
there
was
a
statement
that
a
minority
could
not
transfer
from
the
city
to
the
road
even
if
he
wanted
to
give
up
his
competitive
status
seniority,
that
is
not
so.
at
anytime,
a
minority
or
a
non
minority
employee
in
the
city
can,
if
he
wants
to,
transfer
from
the
city
to
the
road
for
competitive
seniority
status,
he
will
have
to
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
road
board.
he
keeps
his
benefit
seniority
when
he
goes
to
the
road
but
it
is
not
true
to
say
that
there
is
a
no
transfer
policy,
i
believe
it
has
been
pointed
out
here
that
time.
dc.
is
maybe
one
of
the
few
of
the
larger
trucking
companies
that
does
not
have
no
transfer
policy.
and
the
record
shows
uniformly
that
with
one
or
two
exceptions,
transfers
were
allowed
from
city
to
road.
the
government
also
assumes
that
fewer
than
half
of
the
people
involved
here
will
transfer.
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
that.
this
should
have
been
put
in
at
the
trial
and
we
believe
the
justice
department
attempted
to
put
in
as
much
evidence
as
it
could
as
to
who
the
people
were
that
had
suffered
discrimination.
we’ve
already
tried
that
issue
and
we
should
not
have
to
go
back
and
try
that
issue
and
to
try
remedy
all
over
again.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
your
honor,
we
argued
that
the
government
had
not
proven
that
and
we
thought
that
they
should
have
put
that
into
the
record.
there
may
have
been
some
scattered,
limited
evidence
to
that
affect,
i
do
not
believe
that
they
came
forward
and
said,
here
is
your
list
of
employees
in
1971,
here
is
the
number
of
openings
you
had
from
1965
to
1971
and
here
is
the
racial
identification
of
the
people
you
put
in
those
openings.
we
say
they
failed
in
not
putting
in
that
type
of
evidence.
the
government
has
not
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
it
is
a
qualified
no,
your
honor
because
with
a
record
as
long
as
this
one
was,
i
am
sure
that
there
maybe
one
or
two
terminals,
there
was
some
information
as
to
that
type
put
in.
i
do
not
recall
specifically
that
there
was.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
i
do
think
it
makes
a
difference.
we
believe
that
the
government
has
not
addressed
several
critical
issues.
we
have
argued
that
we
believe
mcdonnell
douglas
should
apply
in
determining
liability
and
remedy
and
the
scope
of
those
proofs
in
individual
class
and
pattern
or
practice
cases
and
there
has
been
nothing
suggested
in
the
brief
of
the
government
or
in
the
oral
argument
today
why
mcdonnell
douglas
should
not
so
apply.
as
i
mentioned
before,
there
has
been
nothing
stated
here
in
response
to
our
statement
that
all
the
proofs
were
put
in
for
liability
and
remedy
at
the
trial
stage.
there
has
been
no
response
by
the
government
to
our
argument
that
the
discretion
granted
to
a
district
court
in
matters
like
this
has
to
be
very
broad
to
exercise
proper
equitable
discretion.
franks
and
the
forton
case
tell
us
that.
we
believe
in
the
circumstances
that
it
was
a
reasonable
decision
by
the
district
court,
even
if
we
assume
there
was
discrimination
to
award
the
relief
that
the
district
court
did
for
categories
a,
b
and
c
particularly
in
light
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
partial
consent
decree
that
not
only
settled
back
pay
awards
for
this
same
class
but
also
affirmatively
offered
future
hiring
on
what
is
a
very
substantial
ratio,
a
one
to
one
basis.
also
the
government
has
not
addressed
the
conflict
between
the
circuits
as
to
qualification
date
and
what
that
means
and
we
believe
that
the
failure
to
address
these
things
should
result
at
the
very
least,
in
affirmation
of
the
order
of
the
district
court
or
a
finding
that
the
company
is
not
guilty
of
discrimination.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
may
i
make
a
brief
comment
with
respect
to
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
these
contracts
have
been
reformed
in
many
instances
through
consent
decrees
and
through
agreements
with
the
office
of
federal
contract
compliance
of
the
department
of
labor
and
literally
tens
of
thousands
and
probably
hundreds
of
thousands
of
employees
have
been
covered
by
final
decrees
litigated
in
consent
as
well
as
by
these
agreements
with
the
office
of
federal
contract
compliance
that
are
all
premised
on
the
theory
of
the
quarles
line
of
cases
that
i
have
been
talking
about,
the
most
prominent
of
them
covering
50,000
workers
in
the
nine
largest
steel
producers
was
entered
as
a
consent
decree
in
the
allegheny-ludlum
steel
case,
united
states
against
allegheny-ludlum
steel
in
which
the
united
steel
workers
union
was
one
of
the
party’s
defendant
that
entered
into
the
consent
decree.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
at
all,
we’ve
specified
in
our
brief
exactly
what
we
think
the
relief
--
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
are
ambiguities
in
that
opinion,
we
have
stated
what
we
consider
to
be
the
proper
interpretation
of
it,
looking
at
the
section
called
qualification
date
as
referring
back
and
modifying
the
rest
of
it.
it
seems
to
me
they’ve
spelled
out
very
carefully
in
a
subsequent
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
which
is
referred
to
in
our
brief,
specifies
that
in
even
greater
detail.
as
does
the
rodriguez
decision
which
this
court
cross
references
to
and
then
there’s
a
subsequent
decision
which
we
referred
to
in
our
brief
that
specifies
it
in
even
more
detail
where
we
discussed
qualification
date
in
our
brief.
