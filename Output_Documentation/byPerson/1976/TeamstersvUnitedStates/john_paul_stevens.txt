mr.
wells,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn’t
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wells,
before
you
go
on,
could
you
just
clarify
something
for
me?
even
under
the
court
of
appeals'
approach
it's
necessary
to
make
individual
determination
as
to
qualification
as
i
understand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
maybe
different
dates
of
course,
it
could
be
different
proofs
for
different
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
under
the
district
court
analysis,
i
want
to
get
the
difference
between
the
two
as
best
as
i
can.
what
was
the
test
the
district
court
applied
to
determine
whether
or
not
an
individual
was
a
“victim?”
was
it
whether
they
made
application
or
was
there
some
other
thing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
change
the
question
just
a
little
bit
then
i
don’t
mean
to
interrupt
but
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
disagree
with
the
district
--
the
court
of
appeals'
approach
of
qualification.
what
do
you
say
the
correct
test
of
whether
an
individual
should
get
a
get
relief
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
be
correct
to
summarize
by,
they
should
show
in
addition
to
qualification
either
a
specific
application
or
specific
reason
for
not
applying
at
a
given
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
how
many
--
does
the
record
tell
us
how
many
city
drivers
there
were,
how
many
were
black
and
how
many
were
white?
there’s
a
figure
that
the
union
refer
to
of
2400
a
400
were
black,
but
that’s
not
city
drivers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes
cause
that’s
what
you
say
as
the
primary
--
they
are
the
primary
victims
of
the
failure
to
go
for
the
(voice
overlap).
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
that?
your
theory
is
that
the
seniority,
separate
seniority
for
city
and
over
the
road
drivers,
the
third,
the
black
drivers
should
giving
up
their
city
jobs
with
seniority
and
taking
over
the
road
jobs.
did
it
not
equally
deter
white
city
drivers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there
were
more
white
city
drivers
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
aren’t
they
the
ones
who
got
the
jobs
rather
than
the
blacks?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
how
was
that
deterrent
discriminatory
in
its
impact
on
the
black
drivers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
your
theory
is
that
the
seniority
in
the
city
positions
generally
speaking
was
much
greater
for
the
black
and
for
the
white
and
therefore
hit
a
higher
cost
to
pay
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
evidence
show
the
--
what
the
average
seniority
of
the
white
transferring
from
city
to
road
was
as
compared
to
the
relative
seniority
of
the
blacks?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that’s
critical
really
to
your
position,
that’s
critical
to
your
whole
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
they
had
equal
seniority
what
would
the
(voice
