do
you
say
that
the
(voice
overlap)
--
higher
percentage
on
the
roads?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
didn’t
effect
it
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
all
of
this
period
you’re
talking
about,
that
number
didn’t
increase?
justice
thurgood
marshall
filed
with
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
is
this
the
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
a
court
would
not
have
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
you
say
white
city
drivers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
you
take
white
city
drivers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
there
have
been
no
more
no
less
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
then
penalize
the
negro
driver
in
california,
what
the
white
driver
in
memphis
did?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
wells,
let’s
be
realistic.
if
one
of
the
negro
city
drivers
is
hired
by
this
company
and
put
on
the
line
drive
and
given
the
seniority
that
this
opinion
says,
do
you
show
me
that
the
union
will
not
object
to
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
do
you
argue,
going
back
on
your
own
contract?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
going
back
--
your
contract
says
seniority,
doesn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
union
contract
says
seniority
on
the
line.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn’t
say
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said,
if
he
comes
in
with
seniority
back
to
when
he
first
applied,
would
the
white
man
that
is
thereby
interfered
with,
comes
to
his
union
which
is
your
union,
what
would
you
say,
too
bad?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
union?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he’s
in
one,
he’s
in
the
local,
isn’t
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn’t
he
in
the
city
local?
justice
thurgood
marshall
over
the
white
man.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
negro
won’t
get
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that’s
not
in
your
contract.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
that
in
the
contract?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
when,
if
you’ll
understand
my
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
in
the
contract
did
you
see
about
somebody
who
were
discriminated
against
because
of
race.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we’ll
find
it,
go
ahead,
go
ahead,
we
will
find
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
do
not
see
anything
there
about
seniority
as
waived.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’d
rather
take
your
word
for
it.
