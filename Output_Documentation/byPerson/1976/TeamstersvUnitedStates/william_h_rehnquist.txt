justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
shuler
on
this
point
you
are
challenging
the
findings
of
the
district
court
as
well
as
of
the
court
of
appeal
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
the
court
--
the
court
of
appeals
in
effect
just
said
all
of
them
are
going
to
have
the
same
seniority.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
doesn’t
that
suggest
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
your
answer
to
justice
white’s
question
suggests
at
least
some
arguable
difficulty
with
your
definition
of
a
class
of
400?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
weren’t
these
people
here
--
the
people
in
franks
had
all
made
some
either
effort
to
obtain
employment
or
had
been
discouraged
by
a
refusal
to
employ,
you
don’t
have
that
limited
a
criterion
here,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
after
1965
they
knew
it
was
a
violation
of
federal
law
for
the
company
to
follow
that
policy,
but
did
follow
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
summarize
briefly
what
the
reasoning
of
these
quarles
line
of
cases
as
why
the
act
requires
this
result
with
respect
to
the
union?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
doesn’t
bona
fide
denote
a
state
of
mind
rather
than
a
consequence?
