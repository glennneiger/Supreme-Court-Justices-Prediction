mr.
robert
d.
shuler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
company
in
a
consolidated
case
which
involves
also
petitioner,
international
brotherhood
of
teamsters.
i
wanted
to
make
a
preliminary
comment.
we
have
not
filed
a
reply
brief
in
this
matter
because
of
the
press
of
time.
without
intending
any
criticism,
we
received
the
brief
of
the
government
on
december
21
and
its
original
due
date
had
been
september
10,
i
believe.
if
the
court
believes
that
it
is
desirable,
we
will
submit
a
reply
brief.
this
involves
a
claim
against
a
nationwide
trucking
company
that
has
terminals,
that
has
51
terminals
throughout
the
country
and
it
is
a
claim
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
that
t.i.m.e.-d.c.
and
its
predecessors
have
been
guilty
of
discrimination
in
the
assignment
of
minorities
to
lower
paying
jobs
than
non-minority
employees.
discrimination
by
refusing
transfer
and
maintaining
a
seniority
system
under
contract
with
the
international
brotherhood
of
teamsters
that
perpetuates
the
effect
of
discrimination.
the
teamsters
were
also
charged
with
being
parties
to
a
contract
that
locks
in
the
effects
of
prior
discrimination.
this
suit
was
filed
in
early
1971
and
as
the
amicus
brief
on
behalf
of
the
naacp
group
indicates,
three
justice
department
attorneys
spent
a
year-and-a-half
developing
evidence.
they
were
aided
by
the
post
office
in
obtaining
copies
of
compliance
reports
by
t.i.m.e.-d.c..
they
received
aid
from
the
eeoc
in
the
form
of
complaints
that
had
been
filed
with
the
eeoc
and
they
received
aid
from
the
fbi
in
copying
over
a
thousand
documents
in
the
possession
of
t.i.m.e.-d.c.
whose
files
were
willingly
opened
for
the
examination
by
the
fbi
and
the
justice
department.
we
are
also
told
in
that
amicus
brief
that
they
were
60
depositions,
150
witnesses
in
addition
to
the
deponents
were
interviewed
by
the
justice
department,
attorneys
and
that
the
justice
department
itself
copied
over
a
thousand
documents.
i
mention
this
only
to
point
out
that
this
case
received
the
full
benefit
of
the
plaintiff,
the
justice
department
in
presenting
evidence
as
to
a
pattern
or
practice
of
discrimination
and
in
presenting
evidence
not
only
as
to
liability,
but
also
as
to
remedy.
then
at
the
trial
there
was
a
consent
decree
that
took
care
of
the
issues
of
back
pay
which
we
think
is
a
very
significant
feature
and
in
regard
to
that
virtually
all
of
the
persons
who
were
entitled
to
back
pay
accepted
the
back
pay
and
signed
releases.
the
other
issue
taken
care
of
by
the
consent
decree
was
the
issue
of
future
hiring
and
the
company
agreed
to
hire
minorities
for
all
of
its
job
classifications
at
all
terminals
on
a
one-to-one
ratio
with
non
minorities.
the
consent
decree
is
specifically
left
open
whether
there
was
in
fact
discrimination
by
the
company
and
the
identification
of
discriminatees
if
any,
who
were
suffering
presently
from
the
past
effects
of
discrimination.
at
the
trial
the
justice
department
submitted
a
list
in
response
to
the
request
of
the
district
court
of
non
--
of
the
discriminitees
for
whom
specific
relief
was
sought
and
immediately
following
the
trial,
the
district
court
also
asked
the
justice
department
for
a
list
of
all
of
the
discriminitees,
including
class
discriminitees
for
whom
relief
was
sought
and
such
a
list
was
submitted
in
june
of
1972.
it
is
significant
to
note
that,
that
list
which
is
shown
in
the
appendix
has
the
names
of
each
of
the
individuals
who
are
in
the
alleged
class
of
the
city
employees
at
those
terminals
were
t.i.m.e.-d.c.
has
road
operations.
and
beside
each
of
their
name
there
is
an
indication
that
the
relief
sought
in
virtually
all
cases.
the
relief
sought
is
a
transfer
to
road
possession
with
seniority
for
competitive
status
as
of
the
date,
the
person
originally
became
an
employee
of
the
company.
the
--
mr.
robert
d.
shuler
your
honor
that
is
in
volume
one
of
the
appendix,

195.
mr.
robert
d.
shuler
the
very
first
person
listed
there
is
a
man
name
j
f
johnson
of
hayward
california
terminal.
the
relief
sought
for
him
is
to
be
offered
a
vacancy
in
a
line
driver
job
on
a
basis
of
his
company
seniority
date.

was
not
a
witness
at
the
trial.

honor
is
the
first
list
that
was
submitted
at
the
trial.

persons
for
whom
individual
relief
was
sought.

robert

relief.
mr.
robert
d.
shuler
well
your
honor
the
--
i
was
asked
about
what
appeared
on
page
191
and
that
was
the
first
list
--
mr.
robert
d.
shuler
--
that
was
submitted
at
the
trial
of
those
for
whom
individual
relief
was
sought.
the
later
list
at
195
is
the
list
submitted
after
trial
in
response
to
direct
request
by
the
district
court
of
all
discriminitees,
classes
and
individuals.
the
district
court
conducted
a
trial
on
all
issues
of
liability
and
remedy
and
ordered
relief
in
the
way
of
finding
the
company
guilty
of
discrimination
based
upon
statistical
evidence
in
the
testimony
of
those
who
did
testify
at
the
trial
plus
deposition
testimony.
the
district
court
then
awarded
relief
in
the
remedy
stage
which
was
combined
with
the
liability
stage
to
three
categories,
on
appendixes
a,
b
and
c.
the
first
two
consisting
of
individuals
who
had
testified
or
had
been
deposed
who
were
given
awards
of
senior
--
the
right
to
transfer
and
awards
of
seniority
as
of
the
effective
date
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
the
third
category,
the
so
called
appendix
c
authorized
the
transfer
of
all
minority
city
employees
to
road
vacancies
based
upon
taking
competitive
status
seniority
with
them
as
of
the
date
they
entered
the
particular
road
vacancy.
on
appeal
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
completely
dismantled
the
decree
of
the
district
court.
the
circuit
court
first
of
all
viewed
the
proceedings
below
as
being
a
bifurcated
trial
and
replete
in
the
circuit
court
decision
are
references
to
the
liability
stage
of
the
trial
and
that
proof
should
have
been
saved
to
the
remedy
stage
of
the
trial,
as
if,
there
were
going
to
be
another
trial
contemplated
by
the
district
court.
this
is
definitely
not
the
case.
everything
that
was
done
in
that
district
court
proceeding
was
in
the
nature
of
proving
or
disproving
liability
as
well
as
remedy.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
then
set
aside
the
appendix
a,
b
and
c
lists
and
the
relative
awards
of
seniority
and
indicated
inline
with
previous
decisions
that
all
the
city
employees
who
were
on
the
appendix
c
list
were
to
be
and
the
other
list
as
well
to
work
--
to
be
considered
and
to
be
given
full
competitive
seniority
upon
transfer
to
the
road.
in
our
view
the
circuit
court
erred
seriously
in
several
respects
and
the
view
of
the
government
is
not
sound
for
several
respects
as
well.
first
on
the
issue
--
mr.
robert
d.
shuler
the
--
you
mean
--
mr.
robert
d.
shuler
that
is
correct,
his
full
seniority
to
antedate
the
--
mr.
robert
d.
shuler
yes,
i
believe
it
is
your
honor.
we
take
the
--
because
we
take
the
view
that
the
--
even
if
we
assume
arguendo
a
liability
that
the
proper
remedy
is
to
reinstate
the
district
court
decision
which
would
limit
the
amount
of
seniority
--
mr.
robert
d.
shuler
to
the
effective
date
of
the
act
for
one
class
and
to
later
dates
for
the
two
other
classes
on
appendixes
b
and
c.
mr.
robert
d.
shuler
yes
it
did
your
honor.
the
--
that
they
--
it
was
exactly
as
the
government
had
requested
based
upon
prior
decisions
and
cases
such
as
bing
versus
roadway,
the
so
called
qualification
date
seniority.
mr.
robert
d.
shuler
no,
it
does
not
amount
to
bumping,
your
honor,
because
persons
--
mr.
robert
d.
shuler
--
has
to
be
a
vacancy
before
a
person
under
the
fifth
circuit
view
can
move
in
with
qualification
date.
mr.
robert
d.
shuler
seniority.
the
thing
i
do
want
to
set
aside
is
that
on
the
--
we
believe
that
liability
must
be
proven
in
the
case
such
as
this
not
just
through
statistics.
we
believe
that
your
decision
in
mcdonald
douglas
indicates
that
statistics
are
merely
helpful
and
that
the
legislative
purpose
is
not
for
racial
balance,
but
simply
non-discriminatory
hiring
after
1965.
we
have
pointed
throughout
our
brief
to
the
statistics
that
were
showed
by
the
government
that
there
were
simply
so
many
people
and
in
certain
jobs
as
of
march
of
1971.
we
believe
the
burden
was
on
the
government
to
show
what
happened
between
1965
and
1971.
how
many
openings
were
there
for
jobs
and
how
were
those
filled
and
were
they
filled
in
the
discriminatory
or
a
non-discriminatory
manner.
that
proof
was
not
to
put
in.
i
will
not
go
into
all
of
our
counter
statistics,
but
we
believe
that
we
showed
there
were
--
there
was
definite
decline
in
business
and
in
job
openings
from
7200
to
6400
employees
from
1967
to
1972.
and
yet
the
utilization
of
minorities
went
from
7%
in
1967
to
10%
in
1971
and
today
there
are
16%
minorities
on
the
payrolls
of
t.i.m.e.-d.c..
and
the
other
evidence
of
liability
was
said
to
be
massive
by
the
circuit
court
and
to
be
in
support
of
the
statistical
evidence.
21
terminals
were
involved.
it
had
11
terminals.
there
was
no
evidence
at
all
by
any
witness.
at
10
terminals
there
were
depositions
of
34
witnesses
and
they
were
mostly
at
four
places
atlanta,
nashville,
memphis
and
the
two
los
angeles
terminals.
mr.
robert
d.
shuler
that
is
correct
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
robert
d.
shuler
that
is
correct
your
honor.
we
raised
the
statistical
evidence
--
our
point
for
several
reasons.
one,
we
do
not
believe
the
court
has
made
a
definitive
statement
as
to
whether
statistics
themselves
maybe
completely
dispositive
of
the
case.
secondly,
we
believe
the
statistics
were
the
major
reason
for
the
decision
here.
turning
again
to
the
other
evidence
--
mr.
robert
d.
shuler
that
is
our
reason,
one
of
our
main
reasons
for
saying
that
the
statistical
evidence
was
deficient
in
addition
to
the
other
things.
there
was
one
man
that
we
indicated,
a
man
named
stenson
who
had
in
fact
applied
in
san
francisco
and
there
were
no
openings
after
his
time
of
application
until
the
time
of
the
trial.
the
time
i
have
reserved
for
direct
comments
is
up,
i
am
in
this
proceeding
--
i
am
reserving
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
