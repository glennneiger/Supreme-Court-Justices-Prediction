mr.
richard
w.
prospect
mr.
chief
justice
it
may
please
the
court.
my
name
is
richard
prospect
and
i
am
appearing
here
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
state
of
florida.
i
have
just
sat
here
for
the
last
15
minutes
and
listened
to
the
number
of
times
with
which
mr.
kalmus
has
attributed
the
state,
the
respondent
is
caused
with
admitting,
conceiving
and
otherwise
not
contesting
the
fact
that
the
statements
that
appear
in
this
record
that
were
arguing
the
closing
argument
of
the
state’s
case
are
irrelevant,
outrageous,
ridiculous
and
otherwise
having
no
place
in
any
trial
in
our
state
or
any
other.
i
replied
to
him
by
saying
what
else
could
i
do,
the
statements
are
there,
i
am
not
about
to
tell
the
court
that
they
are
not,
i
am
not
about
to
tell
the
court
that
it
means
something
other
than
the
plain
meaning
of
their
words
are.
my
question
is
or
my
position
is,
of
those
portions
other
remarks
that
absolutely
are
irrelevant
to
any
business
at
hand
there
is
nothing
that
ca
not
be
said
except
were
they
prejudicial
to
this
defendant.
the
other
portions
that
were
more
or
less
listed
in
the
petitioners
dissection
of
the
argument
are
at
least
in
part
in
response
to
certain
things
that
the
jury
heard
first
by
defense
counsel.
now
the
mention
about,
the
only
way
i
know
this
man
is
not
going
to
get
back
out
on
the
public
is
to
sentence
him
to
death.
now,
that
came
in
response
to
something
defense
counsel
started
off
in
the
first
argument
the
jury
heard.
if
you
will
read
that
you
will
find
that,
mr.
maloney
the
first
defense
counsel
stated
that
ladies
and
gentlemen
on
the
evidence
the
state
has
presented
today,
they
are
asking
you
to
kill
my
client.
now,
mcdaniel
quickly
corrected
that
misimpression,
he
very
clearly
and
substantially
told
the
jury
that
ladies
and
gentlemen
we
are
not
here
to
do
that
right
now,
we
are
here
to
determine
guilt
or
innocence
and
nothing
else.
we
have
a
second
stage
of
the
proceeding
in
which
i
will
ask
for
the
death
penalty
and
i'm
going
to
ask
for
it
because
it
is
the
only
way
i
know
to
keep
this
man
off
the
street.
now
that
is
something
that
we
can
justify
because
it
is
not
response
to
what
occur.
the
other
matter
–
let
us
not
nitpick
over
any
of
them,
let’s
not
reread
them
or
anything
else,
i
know
they
are
there,
you
know
they
are
there.
let
us
decide
whether
they
deprive
this
man
of
a
fair
trial.
now,
anybody
and
probably
everybody
who
is
familiar
with
his
record
will
quickly
agree
that
these
arguments
had
no
place
there.
everybody
except
defense
counsel,
it
is
not
until
the
last
page,
as
it
appears
in
the
appendix,
does
that
objection
occur.
why
is
this,
they
were
either
asleep,
they
did
not
think
anything
was
wrong
with
the
remarks
or
and
i
believe
this
comes
into
the
rationale
of
the
estelle
and
francis
case.
they
thought
perhaps
we
just
got
reversible
error.
does
it
take
a
legal
wizard
to
see
there
or
to
sit
there
and
to
listen
to
man
take
off
and
in
a
rent
and
know
that
something
is
not
right.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
no
i
cannot.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
no
i
cannot.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
well
i
can,
i
can
if
as
i
was
about
to
say,
if
they
think
they
have
got
reversible
era.
because
that’s
on
the
back
side
upfront
they
have
got
the
shot
at
the
verdict.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
perhaps
mr.
kalmus
can
answer
that
when
he
gets
back,
i
don’t
know.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
well
is
it
ineffective.
if
he
doesn’t
object
thinking
that
he
got
to
shot
the
verdict.
i
mean
if
he
is
right
today
when
he
says
that
the
evidence
was
close
i
do
not
happen
to
agree,
but
if
is
right
and
you
got
a
close
case
you
got
to
shot
at
that
verdict
because
you
could
always
walk
out
that
day
but
if
you
are
wrong
you
have
got
guilt
in
there.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
exactly
that
is
why
i
think
the
rationale
of
francis
and
estelle
applies.
if
something
is
occurring
that
you
don’t
like
get
on
your
feet
and
say
so.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
well
no
it
is
really
a
very
pointed
and
specific
objection.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
exactly,
i
am
sorry
i
believe
mr.
darden.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
but
not
on
the
basis
of
being
anything
being
inflammatory
or
prejudicial.
apparently
mcdaniel
misstated
something,
something
of
no
consequence
and
mr.
goodwill
says
there
is
been
no
testimony
and
mcdaniel
replies
i'm
sorry
i
believe
mr.
darden
testified
to
it.
i
do
not
believe
so
says
goodwill
and
the
court
reinstructs
the
jury.
ladies
and
gentlemen
it
is
recollection
of
the
evidence
is
what
is
important.
now
if
something
that
trivial…
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
well
i
do
not
think
it
indicates
any
prejudice
towards
the
defendant,
it
is
the
fact.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
no,
that
second
objection
as
i
pointed
out
in
brief
is
really
nothing
more
that
i
request
to
the
man
stick
to
what
evidence
he
had.
now,
apparently
got
to
remember
you
want
to
go
to
the
beginning
of
things.
go
to
the
very
beginning
and
we
see
that
mr.
maloney
says,
ladies
and
gentlemen
we
have
been
here
five
days,
we
got
a
long
trial
and
after
or
in
response
for
the
statement,
the
only
thing
he
has
not
done
that
i
know
of
his
cut
his
throat.
alright
maloney
gets
on
his
feet
and
says,
your
honor
it
is
about
the
fifth
time
that
he
has
come
and
that
he
wish
someone
would
shoot
this
man
or
that
he
would
kill
himself.
i
wish
the
court
would
instruct
mr.
mcdaniel
and
stick
with
what
little
evidence
he
has
and
then
is
perhaps
and
less
than
professional
response
mcdaniel
comes
back
with,
you
don’t
have
any
evidence
yourself
mr.
maloney.
now,
we
can’t
get
the
feel
of
this
on
the
printed
page
but
apparently
the
court
was
fed
up
with
that
and
replied
alright
gentleman
proceed
with
your
argument.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
well
he
overruled
a
request
for
an
instruction
that
mcdaniel
stick
with
what
little
evidence
he
has,
that
is
the
only
form
of
a
quote
on
objection
i
quote.
he
did
not
say
i
object
your
honor
on
the
basis
that,
it
is
prejudicial
inflammatory
or
unconstitutional
and
i
want
to
mistrial
or
i
want
at
least
a
curative
instruction.
have
he
done
that,
he
would
have
given
the
trial
court
the
opportunity
to
rectify
any
error
that
was
happening.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
no
i'm
not
going
to
say
he
could
not
recognize
it,
i
am
sure
he
did.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
he
did
not
asked
for
it.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
no
i
think
there
are
two
different
things,
what
the
judge
realized
and
what
he
was
asked
to
do.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
i
cannot
and
do
not
read
it
that
way,
so
i
don’t
know
what
that
indicates.
that
only
indicates
to
me,
that
mcdaniel
stopped
his
argument,
there
was
a
discussion
of
the
record
between
whom
we
do
not
know
and
he
continued.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
i
would
say
that
based
on
my
experience,
objections
are
made
in
front
of
the
jury
and
generally
i
really
do
not
recall
the
necessity
for
having
them
taken
out
of
the
court
room
in
order
to
discuss
something.
i
believe
the
objection
and
whatever
the
grounds
that
it
is
based
on
is
here
before
the
jury.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
no
sir,
it
may
just
as
well
have
related
to
a
conference
between
mcdaniel
and
his
co-counselors
as
to
what
he
was
going
to
say
next.
i
mean
just
as
you
show
that
one
way
or
the
other.
now
we
have
taken
into
position
of
course
that
it
is
one
thing
for
a
prosecuting
attorney
to
prejudice
a
defended
by
as
closing
arguments.
there
is
another
thing
to
inflame
them
and
it
is
quite
another
thing
but
the
same
to
go
out
side
the
evidence
when
he
does
the
other
two,
that
is
why
we
propose
that
three
full
test
and
we
have
submitted
it
to
the
court
for
the
courts
consideration
in
determining
proper
guidelines
to
let
all
concerned
know
what
it
is
that
is
proper
and
what
is
not
proper
closing
argument
at
least
on
behalf
of
a
prosecutor.
we
do
not
seem
to
have
that
restriction
on
defense.
now,
as
we
stated,
without
an
objection
there
was
no
chance
to
straighten
out
the
jury.
now,
in
a
nutshell
and
in
a
paragraph
in
the
brief
we
stated
that,
that
petitioner
has
claimed
that
by
engaging
all
this
irrelevant
matter
and
this
ridiculous
argument
the
jury
and
we
referred
them
to
as
in
his
brief
and
in
reply
as
rural,
coming
from
rural
florida,
is
implied
that
they
were
so
malleable
and
receptive
to
this
type
of
argument
that
they
automatically
more
or
less
and
necessarily
went
back
in
their
jury
room
and
based
their
verdict
on
what
mcdaniel
said.
they
disregard
of
the
evidence
and
they
were
so
moved
by
the
man’s
tirades
that
they
came
in
with
guilty
based
on
that.
however
he
fails
to
mention
either
today
or
in
reply,
the
fact
that
goodwill
got
up
after
all
of
this
nonsense.
he
says
ladies
and
gentlemen,
“we
are
not
here
to
listen
to
this
man
pound
the
table,
to
yell
to
run
around
and
throw
papers.
do
not
let
him
embarrass
you
into
a
verdict.
you
can
convict
him
on
what
that
man
says
and
by
the
same
token
you
can
not
equate
them
on
what
i
say.
we
are
only
to
help
you.”
that’s
what
the
judge
told
them
in
the
very
beginning.
he
neutralizes
any
effect
and
i
dispute,
that
these
people
were
so
receptive
to
being
improperly
influenced.
now,
i
personally
take
dispute
with
the
rural
floridian
aspect
of
this
case,
that
has
appeared
twice
but
it
wasn’t
mention
today,
but
the
none
the
less
it
was
not
to
reply
brief.
the
case
was
trial
in
citrus
county
florida.
it
is
not
like
jacksonville
or
miami.
apparently
petitioners
of
the
opinion
that
anybody
who
comes
from
that
area
and
who
would
sit
on
the
jury
in
a
murder
case,
would
be
the
rural
type.
now
to
me
rural
means
farms
and
our
country
and
it
is
very
interesting
because
we
floridians
who
are
from
that
state
no
one
thing
and
that
is
there
are
very
few
natives.
most
of
us
are
transplanted.
if
we
look
at
the
jury
selection
on
the
whole.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
citrus
county
florida.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
crystal
river
is
the
closet
to
any
sides,
very
pretty
but
not
large.
so,
if
we
look
at
the
jury
selection
as
a
whole
and
we
examine
the
jurist
who
sat,
we
see
that
that
mrs.
massie
is
a
native
of
ohio.
her
husband
is
retired
army.
mr.
dormany
has
been
in
crystal
river
since
1971
and
had
jury
service
in
georgia.
mr.
karhof
is
from
new
jersey.
he
has
been
in
florida
for
two
years.
mr.
schneider
is
from
illinois.
he
lived
in
florida
for
six
years.
mrs.
lucker
had
been
in
florida
since
1968.
she
was
the
wife
of
retired
aviation
inspector.
mr.
parker
has
been
in
the
area
for
three
years.
he
is
a
nuclear
operator,
florida
power
corporation.
mr.
emback
has
been
in
citrus
county
since
1970,
shift
supervisor
for
the
nuclear
plant
at
ford
power.
mr.
hudson
maybe
a
native,
he
doesn’t
say.
all
that
his
questioning
reveals
that,
he
works
as
an
construction
labor.
mr.
mulroy
is
someone
perhaps
more
to
petitioner’s
liking.
she
happens
come
from
queens,
new
york
city.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
exactly
sir.
her
husband
was
a
30
year
f.b.i.
regional
director
before
he
retired
and
he
lived
in
as
many
as
14
different
places
from
nebraska,
this
city
here
today,
virginia
and
west
chester.
i
believe
that
either
in
state
of
new
york
or
connecticut,
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
pettilat
(ph)
is
a
retired
firemen
from
sarasota,
florida.
he
has
lived
in
citrus
county
since
1971.
we
have
mrs.
hann,
h-a-n-n
who
lives
in
crystal
river
but
she
was
a
retired
supervisor
from
the
security
of
first
national
bank
los
angeles,
california.
finally
mr.
wall
nine
years
with
them
living
in
citrus
county
with
the
county
road
department
maintenance
crew.
so,
we
have
got
two
people
who
maybe
natives,
who
may
possibly
represent
rural
people
from
rural
florida
whatever
that
means.
we
look
at
the
other
people
who
were
not
selected
for
the
jury
and
we
have
everyone
coming
--
we
have
people
coming
everywhere
from
california
to
new
hampshire.
we
have
a
marine
biologist
from
texas,
indiana,
orlando.
a
school
teacher
from
orlando
from
indiana
and
two
other
people
who
have
been
in
the
area
from
five
to
two
years.
so
we
simply
just
don’t
have
whatever
is
supposed
to
mean
by
a
rural
jury.
i
think
that
jury
and
its
composition
and
its
possible
effect,
the
effect
of
the
argument
on
this
jury
has
to
be
considered
very
closely
tied
with
the
necessity
and
the
rationale
behind
an
objection.
if
these
people
are
going
to
be
swayed
then
we
have
got
to
stop
it
as
soon
as
it
begins.
but
if
they
are
not
then,
they
can
be
rehabilitated
by
what
counsel
said
in
his
response
in
his
rebutting
closing
argument
or
he
repeated,
listen
ladies
and
gentlemen
only
to
the
evidence
forget
this
wild
man
over
here,
we
are
not
here
to
do
anything
by
decide
guilt
or
innocence
and
we
of
course
concluded
our
discussion
of
the
jury
with
based
on
this
profile.
now
this
is
just
only
reflects
the
questions
and
answers
which
would
indicate
where
the
people
and
from
and
what
they
do.
now
this
doesn’t
reflect
their
responses
to
other
questions.
standard
jury
questions
which
are
asked
in
all
cases
relative
to
predisposition
to
guilt
innocence,
notoriety
of
the
case
and
so
forth.
you
will
see
some
very
intelligent
answers
especially
those
relating
to
weatherspoon,
you
will
see
some
very
intelligent
people.
we
submit
that
these
people
were
sophisticated
enough
to
know
that
when
mcdaniel
took
off
that
is
all
he
was
doing,
taking
off
and
it
was
perhaps
–
they
viewed
him
with
legal
egg
on
his
face,
if
that’s
possible
phrase
to
use.
we
just
don’t
think
that
they
were
persuaded
to
rush
to
judgment,
put
that
verdict
as
guilty
and
comeback
out
and
say,
we
were
based
on
our
or
being
inflamed,
we
reacted
from
our
heart
and
not
our
head.
i
just
do
not
believe
that,
and
i
have
got
an
idea
that
they
did
not
believe
it
either
or
else
they
would
have
objected
and
they
would
have
at
least
gotten
up
there
and
said,
your
honor
would
you
please
tell
this
man
or
i
object
on
the
grounds
of
this,
let
us
stop
it,
but
perhaps
they
did
try
to
take
a
shot
of
the
verdict
knowing
that
they
have
reversible
error
because
you
got
to
remember
is
not
it
always
good
if
you
are
on
the
defense
side
to
get
a
new
trial
especially
in
a
capital
case.
now
if
they
were
convinced
of
reversible
error
they
know
they
have
got
to
go
florida
supreme
court,
that
court
hears
was
capital
cases.
it
takes
time;
we
conceivably
could
have
had
a
reversal
occur,
have
to
try
this
man
within
five
years
or
more
from
the
offense.
the
second
trial
is
always
fine,
where
you
got
the
possibility
of
missing
witnesses.
you
have
always
got
the
possibility
of
even
with
available
witnesses
dimming
memories
and
every
witness
you
have
got
against
you,
you
can
automatically
ask,
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
can
remember
something
that
clearly
that
happens
four
or
five
or
six
years
ago.
it
is
a
good
shot
to
try
and
get
that
reversal
in
the
second
trial
and
it
is
even
better
shot
to
try
for
the
acquital
because
then
you
can
go
home
that
day
and
i
think
that
the
issue
involved
here
considering
the
lack
of
objection,
considering
the
very
thing,
they
are
yelling
about
the
most,
the
content
of
the
argument.
consider
all
of
that
and
in
light
of
the
entire
record
and
i
think
you
really
have
to
conclude
that
all
though
mcdaniel
–
even
i
represent
the
state,
i
feel
like
i
am
representing
one
man
and
his
conduct.
even
though
he
heard
himself,
and
but
not
the
case,
i
think
you
have
got
to
say
that,
viewed
in
his
totality
willie
jasper
darden
may
not
received
a
perfect
trial,
not
the
antiseptic
one
and
darden
merely
as,
as
you
suggested
mr.
chief
justice
dispassionately
read
something
or
summarize
the
evidence
but
he
got
a
fair
one
and
that
is
what
we
are
here
about.
mr.
richard
w.
prospect
yes
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
believe
we
have
case
law
to
the
effect
that
once
you
know
it
would
be
useless
in
light
of
previous
ruling,
you
don’t
have
to
do
it,
it
still
preserved
properly.
but
using
that
i
will
still
ask
for
one
objection
in
this
record
which
is
not
there.
thank
you
very
much.
