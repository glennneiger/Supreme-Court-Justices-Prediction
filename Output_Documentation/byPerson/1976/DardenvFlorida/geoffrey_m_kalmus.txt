mr.
geoffrey
m.
kalmus
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
court.
my
name
is
geoffrey
kalmus;
i
am
a
partner
in
a
private
firm
in
new
york
city.
i
am
here
representing
willie
jasper
darden.
we
ask
in
this
case
that
the
court
set
aside
mr.
darden’s
conviction
the
first-degree
murder
and
his
sentence
to
death
cause
of
gross
prosecutorial
misconduct
during
summation.
the
court
has
not
heard
afore
in
reviewing
the
state
conviction,
a
held
to
the
prosecutors
closing
argument,
so
far
transcended
the
bounds
of
legitimacy
and
decency
as
to
constituted
deprivation
of
a
dependence
fourteen
amendment
rights.
nonetheless
it
did
recognize
and
justice
rehnquist’s
opinion
in
decristoforo,
that
prosecution
is
remarks
to
the
jury,
may
so
infect
to
trial
with
unfairness
as
to
make
the
resulting
conviction
a
denial
of
due
process.
moreover,
it
is
ruled
in
many
other
contexts
that
circumstances
of
a
criminal
trial
or
other
sorts
of
misconduct
during
it.
a
may
so
impair
the
fundamental
integrity
of
the
jury’s
determination
and
deliberations
as
to
constituted
denial
of
due
process.
we
ask
therefore
in
this
case
that
the
court
apply
settle
doctrine
to
vacate
a
conviction
and
a
jury
recommended
death
sentence
infected
by
willful
righteous
prosecutorial
misconduct.
as
we
see
it,
if
ever
a
prosecutor’s
misconduct
in
summation
can
constitute
a
denial
of
a
fair
trial
this
is
such
case.
i
would
like
first
to
focus
a
little
bit
on
the
evidence
because
it
is
crucial
here,
it
is
crucial
if
the
court
understand
that
this
was
not
a
case
in
which
the
evidence
was
overwhelming,
this
was
a
case
in
which
the
jury
might
rationally
and
reasonably
go
either
way
at
the
end
of
the
evidence.
we
think
the
case
was
doubtful,
we
think
that
the
evidence
plainly
shows
that
not
withstanding
the
respondents
used
to
the
contrary.
now
what
was
the
evidence
here?
mr.
geoffrey
m.
kalmus
your
honor
there
was
only
one
objection
taken
in
the
course
of
the
prosecutor
mcdaniel’s
argument
and
that
was
rather
far
along
in
it
and
at
that
point
defense
counsel
stood
up
and
objected
to
one
of
mcdaniel’s
statements
that
he
wished
the
defendant
had
been
maimed,
that
his
head
has
been
blown
off
or
he
had
been
cut
his
own
throat
of
which
there
were
a
good
many
such
statements.
that
was
the
only
objection
taken
the
trial
judge
simply
without
any
discussion
said
overruled,
proceed
mr.
mcdaniel.
returning
to
the
question
of
the
evidence
as
it
stood
at
the
close
of
the
defense
case,
there
were
only
three
significant
items
of
evidence
supporting
the
prosecutions
claimed
that
mr.
darden
had
committed
this
robbery
murder
of
the
man
name
terman.
two
of
the
items
of
evidence
were
identifications,
those
by
mrs.
terman
who
was
working
in
the
furniture
store
when
the
assailant
came
in
and
that
of
a
young
man
name
mr.
arnold
the
16
year
old
boy
who
kind
of
happened
in
the
backdoor
while
the
crime
was
in
progress
and
was
also
shot
and
injured
by
the
assailant.
both
of
those
identifications
were
shortly
challenged
at
the
trial,
and
both
of
them
i
think
would
put
insubstantial
doubt.
that
subject
was
one
in
which
we
dealt
at
lenghts
in
our
brief
because
at
the
time
we
submitted
our
brief
the
identification
issue
was
also
one
upon
which
the
court
had
granted
cert,
i
may
recall
that
in
early
january,
so
it
was
limited
to
the
first
question
presented
that
at
the
prosecutorial
misconduct.
one
can
judge
mrs.
terman’s
identification
of
the
assailant
in
a
few
fashions.
number
one,
she
gave
a
description
to
the
deputy
sherif
right
after
the
crime
that
bore
no
resemblance
to
the
petitioner.
number
two,
she
described
the
assailant
is
wearing
clothing
that
different
markedly
from
that
what
petitioner
was
described
is
wearing
by
somebody
who
had
seen
him
at
the
seen
him
scene
of
his
automobile
accident
which
according
to
the
prosecution
happened
as
he
was
fleeing
the
crime.
number
three,
mrs.
terman
never
was
asked
to
or
in
fact
identify
the
petitioner
of
any
kind
of
a
formal
line
up
be
it
photo
or
live.
number
four,
her
only
pretrial
identification
in
this
came
into
evidence
on
the
direct
testimony
at
trial
occurred
at
the
preliminary
hearing
when
the
petitioner
was
the
only
black
man
in
the
court
room
seated
with
counsel
of
the
defense
table
and
was
--
mrs.
thurman
was
asked
to
point
him
out
and
she
did
and
one
can
judge
the
reliability
of
that
identification
by
what
she
said
when
she
was
asked
by
the
court
in
effect
are
you
sure?
and
she
responded
why
when
i
walked
into
the
court
room
and
was
seated
in
the
back
and
i
saw
him
from
the
rear
i
knew
this
was
the
man
who
had
killed
my
husband,
this
was
somebody
she
had
seen
for
a
few
minutes
during
the
robbery
and
she
claimed
of
knowing
him
since
she
walked
in
from
his
back.
mr.
arnold’s
identification,
this
is
the
16
year
old
boy,
he
was
subject
to
substantial
infirmity
as
well.
first
of
all
he
testified
a
trial
that
he
had
seen
the
assailant
for
only
20
to
25
seconds
and
in
part
of
that
time
he
was
looking
down
at
mr.
terman
who
had
been
shot
and
laid
in
the
doorway
and
was
trying
to
give
aid
to
him.
number
two,
he
said
his
mind
went
blank
during
that
20-25
seconds.
number
three,
he
was
never,
the
subject
of
a
lying
up
be
it
photo
or
otherwise.
he
did
while
in
the
hospital
identify
the
petitioner’s
photo
in
the
group
shown
to
him
but
his
testimony
was
at
the
trial
that
four
or
the
six
photos
shown
to
him
which
looked
nothing
like
the
petitioner
and
that
the
one
that
he
did
see
and
identify
lo
and
behold
petitioner’s
name
across
it
darden
across
the
chest
and
the
date
09/09/73
of
the
date
of
the
crime,
and
mr.
arnold
testified
that
he
had
read
about
the
crime
before
he
was
asked
to
make
this
photo
identification.
the
final
piece
of
evidence
that
the
state
had
that
amounted
to
anything
was
a
gun
and
the
gun
was
indisputably
of
the
caliber
used
in
the
crime
a
38
and
it
was
found
some
40
feet
from
the
highway
and
a
roughly
the
same
distance
from
the
place
at
which
the
petitioner
had
his
automobile
accident,
no
dispute
that
he
had
the
accident
a
few
miles
from
the
scene
of
the
crime
at
around
the
same
time
and
that
gun
was
found
a
day
later,
not
very
far
from
the
automobile
accident
and
not
very
far
from
the
highway
and
indeed
there
was
no
dispute
that
anybody
might
tossed
it
out
passing
the
car.
so,
that
was
the
states
case
as
the
case
went
to
the
jury.
on
the
defendant
side
the
defendant
had
taken
the
stand
in
his
own
behalf,
he
was
the
only
witness
in
his
own
behalf.
he
had
told
what
i
believe
the
record
demonstrates
to
be
a
coherent
and
plausible
story
not
in
consistent
with
the
prosecution
story
but
to
the
identifications,
not
in
itself
inherently
and
implausible
story
and
that
was
the
case
for
the
defense.
so,
in
sum
the
case
as
it
reached
the
summations
stage
was
a
close
one
and
we
think
the
prosecution
summation
itself
impart
demonstrates
that.
i
think
one
can
ask
rhetorical
question
quite
appropriately,
would
any
sensible
prosecutor
have
carried
on
when
mcdaniel
did
hear
if
he
though
he
had
an
easy
winner.
is
this
the
kind
of
thing
that
any
experience
and
this
was
not
experience
prosecutor
would
do,
if
he
was
comfortable
with
his
case
and
we
think
the
answer
to
that
is
an
obvious
one
and
did
mcdaniel’s
conduct
itself
demonstrates
that
he
thought
his
case
was
shaky
one.
as
to
the
merits
of
the
summation
the
demerits
of
the
summation,
the
character
of
the
mcdaniel’s
conduct
i
do
not
think
the
one
need
past
beyond
the
brief
of
the
respondent
and
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
to
know
how
it
should
be
characterized.
the
respondent’s
brief
what
is
it
called
the
summation
by
mcdaniel
here.
utterly
irrelevant
is
one
phrase,
without
rational
relationships
that
question
of
quilt
or
innocence
is
a
second,
inflammatory
and
irrelevancy
state
says,
improper
appeals
to
the
jury’s
emotion.
finally,
the
ravings
of
the
prosecution
that
is
the
state’s
characterization,
not
ours
of
the
summation
by
mcdaniel.
i
think
if
you
read
the
state’s
brief,
it
is
only
real
argument
in
the
defense
of
the
summation
depart
from
the
procedural
points
that
has
raised
is
that
the
summation
was
so
bad
that
no
sensible
juries
would
have
paid
any
attention
to
anything
that
mcdaniel
said.
now
the
majority
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
this
was
the
conviction
and
death
sentence
were
affirmed
by
5-to-2.
the
majority
opinion
also
recognized
we
think
that
the
closing
argument
was
not
improper
one.
what
have
they
said?
they
said
although
the
prosecutions
remarks
under
ordinary
circumstances
would
constitute
a
violation
of
the
code
of
professional
responsibility.
in
this
particular
case
they
amounted
to
harmless
era
when
the
totality
of
the
record
is
considered.
again
the
language
used
by
the
prosecution
justice
boyd
wrote
for
the
majority
would
possibly
have
been
reversal
error
if
it
had
been
used
regarding
a
less
heinous
set
of
crimes.
illogically
however
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said
this
crime
was
such
a
shocking
one
that
all
of
this
inflammatory
irrelevant
nonsense
was
proper.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
kalmus
i
do
not
think
they
quite
said
that
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
kalmus
i
think
your
comment
certainly
a
fair
one
your
honor.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
kalmus
i
quite
agree
with
you,
they
do
say
that
i
have
read
the
record
a
few
times
and
have
tried
to
summarize
it
as
we
see
the
case
as
balancing
it
on
the
both
sides
and
we
do
not
read
at
that
way
at
all
and
i
might
say
that
in
terms
of
our
description
of
the
evidence
as
it
went
to
the
jury,
the
states
brief
does
not
disagree
with
this
in
any
substantial
way,
the
state
takes
the
same
facts
and
says
we
think
those
were
overwhelming
but
they
are
not
far
linked
at
all
the
presentation
of
the
facts
and
i
agree.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
kalmus
they
did
use
the
phrase
amounted
to
harmless
this
ever,
era
at
one
point
in
their
opinion.
if
that
is
quite
true.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
kalmus
no,
i
think
it
would
have
been
stronger
if
they
have
said
more
accurately
this
kind
of
conduct
cannot
amount
to
harmless
era,
that
there
is
some
conduct
so
outrageous,
willful
for
conduct,
no
questions
about
that
state
can
see
it,
that
this
goes
so
far
beyond
the
bounds
that
it
cannot
be
harmless
era.
we
cannot
say
that
the
jury
was
either
so
smart
that
as
to
disregarded
entirely
or
so
detached
as
to
ignore
the
many
statements
from
the
prosecutor
that
grew
into
issue
all
kinds
of
matters
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
quilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
kalmus
i
agree
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
crime
was
a
shocking
one
and
the
conduct
of
the
assailant…
mr.
geoffrey
m.
kalmus
i
think
that
it
might
have
that
effect
mr.
chief
justice
but
it
would
be
in
effect
based
upon
the
evidence.
our
quarrel
here
is
that
the
prosecution
summation
for
mr.
mcdaniel
summation
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
evidence
and
the
state
does
not
quarrel
with
that
brief,
they
say
yes
it
is
quite
right,
most
of
what
he
said
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
evidence.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
kalmus
justice
marshall.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
kalmus
at
one
point,
one
of
the
defense
counsel
in
summation
and
there
were
two
one
each
sides
summing
up,
said
that
the
assailant
would
do
these
kinds
of
acts
would
be
an
animal.
of
course
he
did
not
attach
that
label
to
the
petitioner
who
he
said
had
not
committed
the
act
which
was
in
accordance
to
the
petitioner’s
testimony.
the
prosecution
picked
up
on
that
and…
mr.
geoffrey
m.
kalmus
no
your
honor,
that
is
one
of
the
many
items
in
the
summation
which
we
have
derelegated
to
footnote
somewhere
in
our
brief.
we
complain
much
more
rigorously
about
the
some
of
the
other
conduct
in
summation.
i
think
just
to
get
a
little
of
the
flavor
of
it,
i
do
not
think
you
can
get
entirely
without
reading
summation
in
full
text.
if
one
can
get
a
sense
of
it
from
just
a
few
quotations
from
one
of
mcdaniel’s
themes,
it
is
the
one
that
he
began
with,
it
is
one
that
he
ended
with
and
it
is
threaded
throughout
his
argument.
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
he
said,
there
should
be
another
defendant
in
this
court
room
that
is
the
division
of
corrections,
the
prisons,
that
had
let
him
out
on
a
weekend
for
a
while,
that
was
the
reason
the
issue
came
up.
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
he
went
on,
this
animal
was
on
the
public
for
one
reason
because
of
the
division
of
corrections
turned
him
lose,
let
him
out,
lets
him
on
the
public.
can
not
we
expect
them
to
stay
in
prison
when
they
go
there,
can
not
we
expect
them
to
stay
looked
up
once
they
go
there,
do
we
know
that
they
are
going
to
be
out
on
the
public
with
guns
drinking?
mr.
terman
is
dead
because
that
are
unknown
defendant
we
do
not
have
in
the
court
room
allowed,
he
is
criminally
negligent.
many
went
on,
tie
us
into
it
significant
to
the
case
and
he
said
the
only
way
i
know
that
he
is
not
going
to
get
out
on
the
public
is
to
put
him
to
death,
convict
him
first
degree-murder.
it
is
the
only
way
i
know,
it
is
the
only
way
i
can
be
sure
of
it,
it
is
the
only
way
that
anybody
can
be
sure
of
it
now
because…
mr.
geoffrey
m.
kalmus
this
was
in
the
punishment
determining
stage
of
the
trial
your
honor,
this
was
in
the
guilt
determining
stage
and
i
think…
mr.
geoffrey
m.
kalmus
i
am
not
certain
that
it
would
be
appropriate
in
the
punishment
determining
stage,
but
i
am
confident
it
is
not
appropriate
when
the
court
has
not
reached
that
stage
of
the
case
and
the
passage
that
i
have
partially
quoted
goes
on
in
much
of
the
same
theme.
again
if
one
looks
at
some
of
these
other
themes,
he
talks
about
the
defendant
and
his
mcdaniel’s
wish
that
the
defendant
had
been
maimed
or
killed
or
shot
themselves,
or
blown
his
head
off
over
and
over
again
he
comes
back
to
that
theme.
obviously
for
no
purpose
then
to
rouse
up
the
jury
to
get
them
to
decide
this
case
without
regard
to
the
evidence.
again
there
is
the
theme
of
putting
the
prosecutor’s
credibility
itself
in
issue,
something
that
every
court
for
long,
long
many,
many
years
has
condemned
and
yet
it
was
done
here
over
and
over
again
by
the
prosecution,
both
by
prosecutor’s
wife
and
by
prosecutor
mcdaniel
saying,
i
know
sure
as
i
am
standing
here
that
this
man
is
guilty.
mcdaniel
again
saying,
why
if
i
were
in
the
petitioner
shoes
i
would
have
lied
like
till
my
teeth
out
also,
remarked
over
and
over
again
of
that
kind.
i
think
one
can
fairly
conclude
only
that
the
prosecution’s
misconduct
was
willful
the
state
does
not
dispute
that,
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
key
reasons
here
why
there
must
be
a
reversal.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
some
comparison
of
this
situation
with
that
in
decristoforo
in
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
said
a
number
of
guidelines
for
dealing
with
this
kind
of
an
issue.
before
i
do
that
i
would
like
to
ask
whether
there
are
any
questions
that
the
court
would
like
to
put
with
respect
to
the
procedural
points
that
the
state
has
raised
and
what
we
have
dealt
in
our
reply
brief.
turning
to
the
merits
than
and
the
comparison
with
decristoforo,
there
were
i
think
three
criteria
that
the
court
thought
crucial
in
decristoforo,
crucial
there
in
finding
that
there
was
no
denial
of
due
process
through
with
the
prosecutors
statement.
there
you
will
remember
what
court
was
concerned
with
was
a
one
sentence
rather
ambiguous
mark
that
according
to
the
first
circuit
at
least
the
majority
in
the
first
circuit
had
indicated
to
the
jury
perhaps
that
the
defendant
had
sought
to
plead
guilty
to
some
lesser
crime
in
first-degree
murder
and
the
prosecution
had
turned
him
down.
so,
it
was
semi-implication
of
guilt
and
it
was
a
single
sentence
which
this
court
found
rather
uncertain
and
ambiguous
in
its
meaning
and
of
little
probable
impact
in
the
context
of
the
entire
case.
three
criteria
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
spoke
about,
one
was
how
larger
role
did
the
prosecutor's
misconduct
if
one
may
call
that
in
decristoforo
occupy
and
in
the
context
to
the
whole
summation
indeed
in
the
context
of
the
trial
and
the
answer
there
was
it
was
one
sentence
out
of
what
the
court
characterizes
a
lengthy
summation.
here
one
has
the
35
type
written
pages
of
summation
by
prosecutor
mcdaniel
and
i
had
try
to
measure
it
and
i
think
you
come
down
around
10-12
pages
if
you
cut
out
the
you
irrelevancies,
the
ravings,
the
carryings
on
about
all
crimes
and
murders
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case.
secondly,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
focused
in
decristoforo,
on
whether
the
prosecution’s
conduct
was
willful
or
was
it
a
mistaken
in
the
heat
of
the
argument.
there
it
was
fair
to
infer
from
the
fact
that
a
single
sentence
was
involved
and
the
judges
in
the
massachusetts
supreme
court,
federal
district
court,
the
courts
of
appeals
and
here
all
disagreed
about
what
that
one
sentence
probably
conveyed
to
the
jury,
it
was
fair
that
conclude
that
misstatement
was
accidental
or
just
poor
phrasing
by
the
prosecutor
in
the
context
of
something
that
came
out
without
prior
planning.
our
case
no
doubt
about
it,
the
state
does
not
contest
it.
this
was
a
calculated
willful
effort
to
rouse
up
to
jury
to
distract
them
from
the
evidence
to
tell
them
that
what
i
am
telling
you
mr.
mcdaniel
was
saying
is
relevant
to
your
consideration.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
kalmus
i
agree
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
if
it
had
been
of
such
palpable
irrelevancy
as
what
a
nice
weather
we
have
been
having,
then
one
would
say
without
any
hesitation
that
maybe
prosecutor
is
little
crazy,
but
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
and
the
juries
could
not
have
been
move
by
it
or
rational
juries
would
not
have
been
move
by
it.
our
case
does
not
fit
that
mould
at
all.
the
comments,
the
many,
many
comments
that
mcdaniel
were
not
off
to
one
side,
they
were
cut
through
from
the
beginning
to
the
end,
number
one.
number
two,
that
they
were
not
of
such
of
palpable
irrelevance
that
sensible
juries
unsophisticated
but
people
of
average
intelligence
would
say,
gee
obviously
that
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
this
case,
i
am
going
to
disregard
it,
they
would
not
say
that
to
themselves
about
the
kinds
of
things
mcdaniel
was
going
on
about.
they
would
say,
as
this
court
said
way
back
in
berger
v.
united
states,
justice
sutherland’s
opinion
that
the
prosecutor
comes
here
with
not
merely
official
backing,
but
presumably
to
do
justice
and
therefore
i
think
juries
would
say
themselves,
we
can
take
it,
the
things
that
he
says
have
some
relevance
to
our
consideration
of
this
man
guilt
or
innocence.
i
think
that
if
you
read
these
remarks
in
context,
one
must
suppose,
one
can
avoid
supposing
that
any
average
group
of
juries
would
have
so
understood
the
remarks
and
would
have
taken
them
into
account
in
deciding
whatever
they
decide.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
kalmus
i
do
not
think
that
i
can
complain
if
the
prosecution
had
confined
itself
to
the
evidence
that
evidence
in
this
case
was
terrible
and
the
evidence
was
a
legitimate
consideration
for
the
jury
in
deciding
whether
to
convict
or
to
quit.
i
think
when
the
prosecutor
willfully
departed
into
matters
that
were
obviously
not
evidence,
were
not
related
to
the
evidence.
that
then
indeed
there
is
a
right
to
complain
and
there
is
a
right
to
have
a
trial
free
of
that
emotional
kind
of
(inaudible).
i
think
just
enclosing
that,
justice
stevens
made
the
point
just
last
week
in
gardener
and
the
statement
was
quoted
this
morning
to
the
effect
that
community
as
well
as
the
defendant
are
entitled
to
have
a
trial
conducted
in
a
intelligent
equitable
non-emotional
fashion
and
to
have
a
jury
decide
the
case
without
the
interjection
of
improper
emotional
factors.
thank
you.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
kalmus
if
i
may,
just
a
moment.
i
think
that
what
the
state
is
asking
here
is
the
prosecutor
be
given
license
to
proceed
willingly
and
whatever
fashion
he
may,
and
on
whatever
ground
he
may
wish
to,
and
to
put
the
defendants
counsel
in
the
box
of
standing
up
and
objecting
every
time
something
you
said,
or
if
letting
it
go
by.
we
all
know
that,
that
is
a
difficult
lawyer’s
decision
to
make
in
context.
like
here
the
state
is
saying,
even
though
the
prosecutor
willfully
makes
outrageous
arguments
that
he
has
no
business
making
and
he
knows
he
has
no
business
making.
still
the
defense
coun
is
going
to
be
kept
in
that
box
and
that
seems
to
us
that’s
not
a
tactical
choice
that
can
fairly
be
imposed
against
willful
misconduct
by
prosecution.
as
to
your
question
mr.
justice
marshall
as
to
why
there
was
no
in
effect
to
the
systems
of
counsel
issue
here.
the
issue
was
not
raised
in
the
courts
below
and
we
did
not
feel
that
could
be
raised
here
for
the
first
time,
perhaps
it
is
raised
upon
habeas
i
do
not
know.
although
i
know
that
from
past
experience
it
is
a
very
difficult
one
to
win.
thank
you.
