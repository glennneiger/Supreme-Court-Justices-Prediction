unknown
speaker
what
stage
of
the
argument
was
the
challenger
objection
made
for
the
argument?
unknown
speaker
they
say
proper
or
they
said
that
it
would
not
have
any
greater
impact
on
than
the
evidence
itself.
unknown
speaker
they
surely
did
not
say
it
was
proper,
you
certainly
misspoke
to
yourself
there
considerably.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kalmus
the
majority
of
the
supreme
court
florida
i
think
that
did
disagree
with
you
as
to
the
closeness
of
the
evidence
and
that
second
last
paragraph
at
page
163
of
your
appendix.
they
say
that
there
was
a
fair
pretty
much
of
an
overwhelming.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kalmus,
florida
supreme
court
said
that
it
did
not
approve
with
prosecutors
argument
but
what
it
found,
i
read
it
that
it
was
the
harmless
era
of
the
overwhelming
character
of
the
evidence.
unknown
speaker
you
think
it
would
have
been
stronger,
if
they
used
it
more
than
once.
unknown
speaker
would
you
not
agree
that
a
completely
dispassionate
objective
description
of
what
had
taken
place;
the
actions
of
the
petitioner
would
have
in
itself
amounted
to
a
shocking
kind
of
statement
just
saying
exactly
what
can
happen.
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
quite
my
question;
the
question
is
if
you
objectively,
uncommonly,
and
quietly
describe
precisely
what
had
happened
would
that
not
shock
the
listener?
unknown
speaker
but
at
some
part
the
defense
even
talked
about
the
animal
that
committed
the
crime.
unknown
speaker
so,
i
think
you
want
to
separate
the
two.
unknown
speaker
you
are
very
quickly
about
that
are
you?
unknown
speaker
is
that
by
itself
an
improper
argument
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
statute
that
constitutionally
authorizes
the
imposition
of
a
death
penalty
for
a
prosecutor
to
say,
the
only
way
you
can
be
sure
this
man
will
not
repeat
this
kind
of
offence
is
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
unknown
speaker
you
would
say
it
was
not
wrong
in
the
punishment
determining
stage
but
it
is
wrong
in
the
guilt.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
mean
that
in
its
full
sweep
what
you
just
said
that,
supposing
the
prosecutor
in
the
midst
of
a
30
minutes
summary
goes
off
on
a
10
minute
total
irrelevancy
about
how
the
weather
is
been
in
the
last
few
days,
but
it’s
not
at
all
prejudicial
to
the
defendant,
do
not
you
have
to
combine
the
two
to
make
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
if
you
have
just
read,
the
prosecutor
had
just
got
the
transcripts
of
the
testimony,
prosecution’s
testimony
of
the
survivors
and
in
effect
read
that
to
the
jury,
would
you
be
complaining
about
his
the
outrageous
character
of
his
argument?
unknown
speaker
very
well
mr.
kalmus,
mr.
prospect.
unknown
speaker
can
you
conceive
of
a
lawyer
not
objecting.
unknown
speaker
defense
can
also.
unknown
speaker
or
can
you…
unknown
speaker
you
did
not
make
an
objection
that
an
average
lawyer
would?
why
is
it
that,
petitioner
doesn’t
the
raise
the
question
with
effect
of
assistance
to
counsel
that’s
what
i
don’t,
and
he
doesn’t...
unknown
speaker
but
he
doesn’t
raised.
unknown
speaker
i
just
do
not…
unknown
speaker
mr.
prospect
your
opponent
also
made
the
point
in
objection
during
the
end
of
the
argument
but
there
wasn’t
objection
on
the
second
page
of
the
argument
page
122.
of
course
it
is
to
an
argument
not
being
supported
by
the
evidence
in
the
record
but
that
is
the
substance
of
much
of
the
criticism
there.
unknown
speaker
he
says
now
i
object
there
is
been
no
testimony
of
this.
unknown
speaker
that
is
on
the
second
page
of
the
argument.
so
he
did
start
to
object
right
away.
unknown
speaker
this
kind
of
indicated
his
attitude
toward
the
objection,
no
he
was
very
sympathetic
to
right
at
the
outset.
unknown
speaker
the
court’s
disposition
of
the
objection
was
well
juries
heard
the
objection,
it
can
decide
for
itself.
unknown
speaker
that’s
the
way
the
judge
handle
the
second
objection.
unknown
speaker
the
judge
apparently
wasn’t
defended
by
the
argument
either,
he
overruled
that
objection
too.
he
said
go
ahead
with
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
your
view
is
the
trial
judge
would
not
recognize
there
was
anything
improper
about
this
argument
without
the
counsel
explaining
it
to
him.
unknown
speaker
than
the
objection
did
not
prompt
any
curative
instruction
at
all.
well,
wouldn’t
you
have
thought
the
trial
judge
would
have
had
some
--
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
saying
that,
that
the
judge
had
to
have
that
explain
to
him
and
the
judge
didn’t
realize
it
was
necessary?
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
any
and
there
is
also
discussion
after
record
about
in
page
127,
mrs.
goodwill
said
in
one
of
the
examinations
i
believe,
mrs.
hill
(ph)
probably
was
another
interruption
there.
it
seems
to
me
that
perhaps
three
interruptions
of
closing
the
argument,
counsel
during
the
argument.
unknown
speaker
is
it
(inaudible)
in
florida
when
one
objects
the
closing
argument
all
is
to
do
so
already
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
or
is
it
sometimes
done
that
you
try
to
have
a
sidebar
and
not
make
such
a
fuss,
it
is
rather
rude
to
interrupt
counsels
you
know
and
you
try
to
avoid
that
sort
of
things
at
times.
unknown
speaker
you
would
not
think
it
is
fair
to
infer
and
i
just
--
the
discussion
of
the
record
on
page
127
might
have
related
to
the
content
of
the
closing
argument.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
is
this
rural
area
in
florida?
unknown
speaker
and
the
town?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
if
in
florida
one
makes
an
objection
to
the
trial
judge
on
the
particular
ground
and
the
trial
overrules
the
objection,
is
it
generally
presumed
that
if
another
similar
instance
arises,
the
lawyer
is
not
required
to
make
the
objection
again
that
the
trial
judges
ruling
would
be
the
same
on
a
subsequent
case.
