paul

is
there
an
issue
of
appealability
in
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
that
the
threshold
issue
of
a
jurisdiction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
it
--
isn't
the
special
issue
usually
the
jurisdictional
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
thornburgh,
just
before
you
go
on
it,
why
won't
the
right
not
to
be
tried
a
second
time
be
irrevocably
lost
if
it's
not
predicted
right
at
this
very
point?
why
doesn't
that
reasoning
apply
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
thornburgh,
couldn't
we
take
care
all
of
those
by
writing
a
narrow
opinion,
making
it
clear
we're
not
deciding
that?
and
if
the
theory
of
this
is
that
it's
a
right
not
to
be
tried
expressed
in
the
--
in
the
fifth
amendment,
why
wouldn't
that
provide
an
answer
to
that
--
to
that
particular
risk?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what's
the
reason
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
--
what
is
your
reason
to
its
--
what
is
your
basic
explanation
why
the
cohen
case
does
not
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
it
your
--
is
it
your
theory
that
the
case
can
go
on
without
deciding
that
issue?it
doesn't
interrupt
the
proceeding?
that
what's
you
seem
to
be
saying
in
your
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
would
be
true
on
the
bailey
situation,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
really
be
true
in
the
cohen
situation.
wasn't
the
theory
of
that
that
requiring
this
security
for
cause
would
have
actually
terminated
the
litigation
of
the
district
court
on
where
it
stood?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
and
isn't
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
the
same
situation
here
that
if
you
allow
the
order
to
stand,
the
defendant
losses
his
right
not
to
be
tried
a
second
time.
well,
why
are
they
different?
i'm
just
a
little
puzzled.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you've
already
agreed
that
none
of
those
involves
a
depredation
cause
by
the
trial
itself.
it
is
the
trial
which
involves
the
violations
of
the
man's
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
constitutional
rights.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
just
ask
one
other
question?
assume
a
state
system
provides
for
appeal
in
this
sort
of
situation
without
the
complication,
extraordinary
writ
that
you
had
in
one
of
those
state
cases.
just
say
it
was
a
direct
appeal
for
the
state
system
and
the
state
supreme
court
rejected
the
claim,
would
that
be
a
final
decision
under
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
there's
a
greater
that
the
requirement
of
finality
is
â€“
that
it
poses
a
stricter
standard
on
federal
and
the
federal
review
than
it
does
on
review
of
state
court
decisions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
suggest
the
state
decision
would
not
be
final
within
that
document
cases
if
there
lurked
the
possibility
of
a
search
and
seizure
issue
on
the
case
or
a
fifth
amendment
or
some
other
federal
constitutional
issue
relating
to
the
merits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we're
still
at
pre-trial.
we
just
know
that
there
are
often
federal
issues
in
state
criminal
trials
and
you're
saying
those
--
the
existence
of
those
would
deprive
the
order
of
finality?
or
are
you
saying
they
don't
make
any
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
just
to
be
sure
i
had
your
answer.
you
do
not
rely
on
the
fact
that
there's
only
one
federal
issue
in
the
state
proceedings.
but
that's
not
your
rationale.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
rather
that
the
state
is
willing
to
allow
an
appeal
so
we
might
as
well
do
the
same
thing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
i
may
ask
you,
does
--
is
that
critical
to
those
decisions
in
your
view?
i
think
it
was
in
judge
friendly's
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
really
make
much
sense,
does
it?
to
say
that
because
there
--
that
it
will
be
appealable
to
--
if
there
can
be
showing
that
there's
no
potential
additional
federal
issue
on
the
case.
that's
kind
of
a
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
literally
the
language
of
the
federal
statute
is
a
little
more
favorable
for
appeal
because
it
talks
about
final
decisions
and
the
underlying
statute
talks
about
final
judgments,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
thornburgh
if
the
question
of
appealability
should
go
against
you,
you
have
only
a
minute
or
two,
i
noticed.are
you
to
say
anything
the
merits?
