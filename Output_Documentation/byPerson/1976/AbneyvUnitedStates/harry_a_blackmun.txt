justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
thornburgh,
in
your
parade
of
anticipated
horribles,
if
you
lose
on
the
double
jeopardy
issue,
would
you
also
include
an
issue
having
to
do
with
the
speech
and
debate
clause?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
suppose
you
do
conceive
that
the
--
the
lynchpin
of
this
case
is
the
nature
of
double
jeopardy.
