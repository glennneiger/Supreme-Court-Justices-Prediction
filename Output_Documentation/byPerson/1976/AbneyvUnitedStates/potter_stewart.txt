justice

stewart
but
are
you
saying
there
would
be
no
power
to
issue
an
extraordinary
writ
pursuant
to
this
at
section
1291,
the
all
writ
sec?
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn't
it
all,
sometimes
be
true,
at
least
sometimes,
mr.
samuel,
that
whether
or
not
the
bar
against
double
jeopardy
where
it's
applicable
would
not
clearly
appear
until
at
least
the
start
of
the
second
prosecution.
i'm
thinking
of
an
ashe
against
swenson
kind
of
case.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
thinking
of
a
collateral
estoppel
kind
of
a
case.
justice
potter
stewart
where
it
might
not
be
clear
until
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
the
prosecution
began
by
putting
it
on
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
he
can
make
it,
but
no
court
can
very
intelligently
decide
it.
that's
why
â€“
that's
--
that
was
the
--
what
prompted
my
question.
