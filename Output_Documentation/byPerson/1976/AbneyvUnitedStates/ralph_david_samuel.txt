mr.
ralph
david
samuel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
petitioner's
claim
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
bars
their
retrial
after
reversal
of
their
conviction
on
a
duplicitous
indictment
for
violation
of
the
hobbs
act.
the
petitioners
were
tried
and
convicted
on
a
duplicitous
indictment
which
charged
in
one
count,
two
separate
offenses,
conspiracy
and
attempt
to
violate
the
hobbs
act.
thereafter,
they
appealed
to
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
reversed
on
other
grounds
and
remanded
for
a
retrial.
three
times
during
the
trial,
initial
trial
of
this
case,
petitioners
moved
to
require
the
government
to
elect
to
proceed
on
one
prong
or
the
other
of
the
duplicitous
indictment.
this,
the
government
steadfastly
refused
to
do.
but
for
the
government's
steadfast
refusal,
this
case
would
not
be
here
today.
now
that
the
case
has
been
remanded
for
retrial,
the
government
proposes
to
retry
these
petitioners
on
the
conspiracy
prong
of
the
duplicitous
indictment.
there
are
substantial
problems
with
retrying
these
petitioners
on
the
conspiracy
prong,
one
of
which
is
the
indictment
as
now
framed
simply
fails
to
state
a
federal
offense.
the
indictment
now
charges
conspiracy
to
commit
attempt
extortion,
something
which
simply
isn't
not
a
crime
under
the
hobbs
act.
the
other
problem,
of
course,
is
that
retrying
these
petitioners
on
one
prong
of
the
duplicitous
indictment
will
expose
them
to
double
jeopardy.
the
petitioners
--
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
your
honor,
we
will
get
to
that
shortly.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
the
--
the
petitioners
appealed
their
--
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
in
this
case
the
--
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
properly,
we
believe,
took
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal
from
their
motions
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
now
--
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
in
--
in
this
court,
the
government
has
raised
the
question
of
jurisdiction
and
i
would
direct
myself
to
that
question.
the
appellate
court
jurisdiction
act
confers
on
the
courts
of
appeals'
jurisdiction
to
hear
final
decisions
of
the
district
courts,
a
well-known
act.
we
believe,
and
we
believe
that
there
is
substantial
precedent
for
the
idea
that
the
denial
of
motion
to
dismiss
on
double
jeopardy
grounds
is,
in
fact,
a
final
decision.
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
properly
assumes
jurisdiction
over
that
question,
this
court,
in
harris
versus
washington,
addressed
a
substantially
similar
issue
and
held
that
the
–
the
court
had
proper
jurisdiction
under
28
u.s.c
section
1257,
the
standards
of
which
has
held
--
been
held
or
has
been
approached
by
this
court
on
the
same
basis
as
the
standards
of
finality
under
section
1291.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
that
was
a
criminal
case,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
the
case
is
not
similar
because
the
federal
appellate
system
permits
a
review
only
by
a
writ
of
prohibition
in
the
intermediate
state
court.
here,
obviously,
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
the
power
to
entertain
a
motion
for
a
writ
of
prohibition
so
that
there
was
no
special
appellate
statute
involved
in
that
case.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
well,
i
think
that
the
--
the
discussion
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
cobbledick
case
is
particularly
appropriate
here
where
he
noted
that
the
right
to
statutory
appeal
must
not
be
interpreted
in
such
a
way
as
to
deny
all
opportunity
for
appeal
under
--
contemplated
by
the
statutes.
in
other
words,
he
said,
exactly,
due
regard
for
efficiency
in
litigation
must
not
be
carried
so
far
as
to
deny
all
opportunity
for
the
appeal
contemplated
by
the
statutes.
now,
the
nature
of
the
protection
in
a
double
jeopardy
clause
is
such
that
it
creates
the
statutory
right
to
appeal.
it
is
--
there
–
there
is
no
decision
more
final
than
the
decision
of
a
trial
court
cutting
off
a
double
jeopardy
claim.
the
only
event
looming
on
the
horizon
of
the
accused
at
that
point
is
the
second
trial.
the
--
the
issues
are
--
are
completely
dissimilar,
the
issues
on
the
question
of
double
jeopardy
and
the
issue
to
be
tried
in
the
second
trial.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
--
i
agree
--
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
--
with
that
that
the
--
the
nature
to
protection
again
is
based
on
the
fifth
amendment,
which
bars
a
second
trial,
and
this
court
has
so
held
it
in
a
long
line
cases
from
ex
parte
lange
through
united
states
versus
ball
and
most
recently,
in
united
states
versus
dinitz.
in
that
sense,
it
is
a
–
a
very
special
type
of
protection.
it
involves
a
decision
of
the
district
court
whether
or
not
to
violate
the
protection,
and
--
and
there
really
is
no
other
constitutional
protection
quite
like
that.
if
any
decision
is
final,
this
one
should
be
in
light
of,
for
instance,
stack
versus
boyle
where
this
court
held
that
the
question
of
bail
could
be
appealed
pre
trial
because
it
was
final
decision
and
that
it
was
collateral
and
did
not
merge
with
the
trial
issue.
here,
we
have
the
same
--
the
same
type
of
situation.
the
question
of
--
of
double
jeopardy
does
not
merge.
it
is
a
--
a
collateral
issue
and
the
issues
--
there
are
no
facts
required
to
be
adduced
at
trial
to
bear
on
this
issue.
all
of
the
necessary
record
facts
are
before
the
court.
the
government
has
become
apparently
quite
concerned
about
the
jurisdictional
issue
and
i
know
recently
that
mr.
--
that
judge
friendly
in
the
second
circuit
has
written
an
extensive
opinion
in
which
he
discusses
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
i
would
be
arguing
with
blinders
on
if
i
were
not
--
do
not
take
cognizance
of
the
concern
of
the
courts
that
granting
the
right
of
appeal
from
this
type
of
decision
would
open
the
floodgates
and
that
every
criminal
defendant
would
immediately
a
double
jeopardy
claim.
i
think
that
that
analysis
misses
a
very
important
distinction,
and
that
distinction
is
between
the
appellate
jurisdiction,
that
is,
does
the
--
the
question
is
does
the
appeals
court
have
jurisdiction
to
entertain
and
to
hear
these
cases
which
we
argue
on
the
one
hand
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
every
defendant
has
a
right
to
have
this
trial
stayed
which
is
really
a
separate
question.
and
the
practice
is,
today,
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania,
where
this
case
arose,
that
the
--
the
courts
do
not
consider
that
every
appellant
has
a
right
to
have
his
trial
stayed.
and
that
the
appellant
must
seek
a
stay
based
on
the
merits
of
this
to
having
a
substantial
double
jeopardy
claim.
and
of
course
that,
really
has
kept
the
floodgates
from
opening
because
the
government
has
only
been
able
to
point
to
10
cases
in
which
appeals
have
been
entertained
in
four
years
since
lansdown
was
decided
which
--
in
the
fourth
circuit,
which
created
initially
the
--
or
held
initially
that
this
was
a
final
decision
appropriate
for
appellate
review.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
not
sat
down
with
a
calculator
and
attempted
to
see
the
amount
of
delay
involved
in
those
cases.
but
given
that
the
extensive
case
load
of
the
federal
district
courts
in
criminal
cases,
i
think
that
10
cases
in
four
years
really
represent
a
very
small
number
of
cases
and
the
amount
of
delay
involved
is
--
is
not
overbearing.
and
again,
the
--
the
words
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
i
think,
are
very
appropriate
as
a
due
regard
for
efficiency
and
litigation,
must
not
be
carried
so
far
to
deny
all
opportunity
for
the
appeal
contemplated
by
the
statutes,
but
even
if
--
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
in
most
of
them,
the
courts
of
appeals
found
against
some
on
the
merits.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
i
--
i
believe
there
is
one
in
which
they
--
they
found
for
the
petitioners
on
the
merits.
nevertheless,
there,
a
judge,
at
some
point,
in
the
proceedings,
made
a
decision
as
in
these
proceedings
that
there
was
a
serious
double
jeopardy
question
involved
and
--
and
either
a
stay
was
issued
or
the
court
took
no
steps
to
--
to
move
forward
to
trial.
now,
in
the
leslie
case,
the
leslie
2
case,
which
judge
friendly
--
which
judge
friendly
has
written
his
lengthy
opinion,
the
case
was
scheduled
to
go
for
a
retrial.
and
finally,
i
assume
judge
friendly
is
the
judge
who
granted
the
writ
of
prohibition
stopping
the
--
the
trial
on
that
case.
and
there,
there
was
not
--
it
was
not
even
a
double
jeopardy
claim.
it
was
a
due
process
claim
based
on
a
plea
bargain
which
the
defendant
had
--
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
well
--
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
that
--
that
judge
friendly's
opinion
in
a
leslie
is
appealable
to
this
court
or
--
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
i
think
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
in
--
unless
he
did
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
appeal.
nevertheless,
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
judge
to
enter
a
stay
or
to
grant
the
writ
of
prohibition
stay
in
the
trial.
he
must
have
thought
that
there
was
a
serious
issue
that
had
to
be
dealt
with
before
doing
that.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
well,
mr.
justice
white,
the
--
the
duplicity
issue
i
--
i
think
is
--
well,
the
duplicity
issue
and
the
double
jeopardy
issue
are
really
one
and
the
same.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
in
this
case,
the
third
circuit
found
that
there
was
--
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
well,
i
--
i
believe
that
the
--
the
pending
issue
here
is
the
failure
of
the
indictment
to
state
an
offense.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
all
right.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
this
--
that
is
not
an
appealable
issue
by
itself,
but
this
court
has
held
in
a
series
of
cases
that
where
a
pending
issue
is
raised
with
a
properly
raised
appealable
issue,
that
the
court
--
if
--
if
decision
of
that
pending
issue
will
have
the
effect
of
terminating
a
litigation,
that
the
court
will
reach
that
issue.
and
the
reason
is,
is
that
the
--
the
considerations
of
efficiency
and
--
and
avoidance
of
piecemeal
review
are
turned
around
once
there's
a
proper
appeal.
and
at
that
point,
those
considerations
militate
in
favor
of
granting
the
motion
to
dismiss
or
--
or
whatever
terminating
action
the
court
may
take.
that's
precisely
the
case
that
we
have
here.
here,
the
district
court
felt
there
was
a
serious
double
jeopardy
claim
and
granted
a
stay,
went
up
on
appeal,
we
believe,
properly,
and
we
raised,
once
again,
the
failure
of
the
indictment
to
state
an
offense.
and
we
--
we
submit
that
was
raised
properly
under
rule
12b
because
it
can
be
raised
at
any
stage
of
the
proceedings
like
jurisdiction.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
believe
that
the
decisions
of
the
court
support
the
idea
that
even
though
the
--
the
properly
raised
issue
is
decided
against
on
the
merits
or
the
court
feels
that
it
not
sufficient
on
the
merits,
they
can
--
they
can
still
reach
the
pending
issue.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
there
--
the
question,
as
i
said
before,
there's
a
division
in
the
question
between
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals
has
jurisdiction
and
--
and
we
say
that
if
it
does.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
they
would
certainly
have
jurisdiction,
we
argue,
to
review
any
double
jeopardy
claim.
nevertheless
--
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
the
--
the
court
has
the
discretion
to
do
so.
it
does
not
have
to.
there
is
no
requirement.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
the
--
this
court
has
--
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
but
nevertheless,
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
the
--
the
discretion
does
not
have
to
be
followed.
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
discretion,
whether
or
not
to
reach
the
pending
issue,
whether
or
not
to
even
consider
it.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
petition
--
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
in
the
petition,
we
raised
both
issues.we
raised
both
issues.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
we
--
it
is
--
it
is
true
that
if
we
have
relief
from
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
we
do
not
need
relief
on
the
pending
issue.
nevertheless,
because
the
indictment
in
this
case
does
not
state
an
offense
that
is,
as
it
is
now
framed
because
it
charges
something
which
is
not
a
crime
under
the
hobbs
act
at
all.
we
think
that
that
is
such
a
glaring
error
in
the
lower
courts
that
this
court
exercising
its
discretion
should
reach
that
issue
and
require
the
indictments.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
the
finality
--
i
believe
that
you
would.
the
finality
decision
here,
the
question
here
is
really,
goes
to
where
there
is
a
double
jeopardy
question
which
has
been
raised.
now
--
now
deciding
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
denial
of
the
double
jeopardy
claim
does
not
--
not
mean
that
they
will
hear
every
double
jeopardy
claim.
it
means
because
in
most
cases
where
there's
a
frivolous
claim
raised,
it
would
be
rendered
moot.
by
the
time
the
court
of
appeals
reaches
the
issue,
the
--
the
second
trial
will
have
taken
place.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
i
don't
think
so.
the
--
the
constitutional
protection,
the
nature
of
the
protection
of
the
--
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
a
special
--
very
special
type
of
protection.
it
is
--
it
requires
the
court
to
make
a
prospective
decision
as
to
whether
or
a
--
the
constitution
will
be
violated.
there
are
--
there
is
no
other
procedural
constitutional
writing
in
criminal
law
that
it
is
--
it
is
quite
like
that.
now,
should
the
court,
nevertheless,
find
that
no
double
jeopardy
that
--
that
no
appellate
jurisdiction
existed
in
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
to
review
the
merits
of
this
--
of
this
issue,
we
believe
that,
nevertheless,
the
court
of
appeals
could
have
reached
the
issue
under
its
mandamus
power.
there
is
a
long
line
of
decisions
which
holds
that
if
a
–
that
if
an
appeal
was
improvidently
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
the
court
of
appeals
may
--
may
treat
it
as
a
petition
for
mandamus
if
the
issue
was
appropriate
from
mandamus
review
and
--
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
that's
correct,
it
did
not.
nevertheless,
we
feel
that
--
that
since
the
issue
was
one
appropriate
for
mandamus
review
or
would
have
been
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
have
reached
it.
and
accordingly,
since
they
did
pass
on
the
merits
that
under
the
rule
in
magnetic
engineering
and
manufacturing
company
versus
dings
in
the
--
in
the
second
circuit
and
hackett
versus
general
host
corporation
in
the
third
circuit
in
which
cert
was
denied
in
1972
that
the
court
of
appeals
--
that
--
that
this
court
can
--
can
reach
the
merits
because
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
had
mandamus
power
to
do
so.
and
it
could
have
done
it
without
requiring
that
the
petitioners
file
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
mandamus.
the
third
circuit
could
have
done
this.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
the
--
the
cases,
the
circuit
court
cases
that
deal
with
this
involve
questions
where
there
is
a
patently
obvious
issue
which
is
available
for
mandamus
review.
i
think
that
in
this
case
we
have
such
a
case
and
therefore,
since
it
meets
the
criteria
that
--
that
the
short
answer
is,
yes,
it
would
require
a
decision
but
that
the
decision
is
a
--
a
formality.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
i
don't
deny
that's
the
case.
nevertheless,
the
court
of
appeals
did
reach
the
merits
in
this
case
on
an
appeal
and
that
the
--
the
merits
of
the
case
are
such
that
they
are
patently
the
kind
of
issue
which
mandamus
will
reach.
that
is,
that
the
district
court,
in
denying
the
motions
to
dismiss
here,
held
that
he
had
no
basis
to
reach
the
merits
following
the
third
circuit's
opinion
after
the
appeal
of
the
first
trial.
he
felt
that
the
third
circuit
opinion
precluded
him
from
reaching
the
merits
and
--
and
made
his
decision
accordingly.
now
that
we
think
that's
an
abdication
of
nisi
prius
jurisdiction
that
the
issue
of
double
jeopardy
had
not
been
argued,
briefed
or
decided
by
the
third
circuit.
and
accordingly,
that
this
is
a
case
appropriate
from
mandamus
review
by
the
third
circuit
on
its
phase.
turning
to
the
double
jeopardy
argument
itself,
the
third
circuit,
in
reviewing
the
decision,
the
indictment
held
that
it
was
duplicitous
and
noted
the
evils
of
a
duplicitous
indictment.
these
are
confusion
and
ambiguity.
these
are
well-known.
they've
been
set
forth
in
a
whole
line
of
cases.
the
principal
evil
of
an
--
a
duplicitous
indictment
is
that
it
requires
the
jury
to
answer
two
separate
questions
with
one
yes
or
no
answer,
something
which
is
almost
beyond
the
--
the
scope
of
logic.
accordingly,
a
guilty
verdict
under
such
a
--
an
indictment
is
--
is
capable
of
various
equally
possible
interpretations.
one
such
interpretation
is
that
the
jury
found
the
defendants
not
guilty
of
the
conspiracy
charge
and
we
believe
that
because
of
--
of
the
presumption
of
innocence
that
we
must
adopt
the
most
favorable
of
the
equally
possible
interpretations,
that
being
that
the
defendants
were
found
not
guilty
of
the
charge
on
which
they
are
now
sought
to
be
retried
by
the
government.
that
presents
a
clear
double
jeopardy
situation
and
their
retrial
should
be
barred.the
government
argues
in
its
brief
that
the
act
of
appealing
to
the
third
circuit
from
the
first
conviction
wipes
clean
the
slate.
the
--
and
thus
prohibits
the
double
jeopardy
claim
from
being
raised.
nevertheless,
this
is
not
that
type
of
situation.
that
is
the
general
rule
and
it
is
a
general
rule
which
exists
and
we
--
we
agree
with.
this
is
a
situation
where
the
petitioners
claim
that
they
were
acquitted
of
the
conspiracy
charge
the
first
time
around,
taking
the
--
adopting
the
most
favorable
interpretation
of
this
ambiguous
guilty
verdict.
accordingly,
appeal
from
the
first
conviction
cannot
have
the
affect
of
wiping
clean
an
acquittal.
it
simply
--
simply
cannot
be
done.
the
--
once
acquitted,
the
petitioners
are
forever
barred
from
having
to
stand
trial
a
second
time
on
the
same
charge.
the
government
also
argues
that
the
charge
of
the
district
court
at
the
--
the
trial
court
on
the
first
trial
cured
the
--
the
infirmity
of
the
indictment.
the
government
cites
no
law
for
this
proposition.
it
seems
that
it
is
completely
unfounded
and
moreover,
the
charge
of
the
court,
which
is
set
forth
in
full
beginning
at
page
11
of
the
appendix,
demonstrates
beyond
peradventure,
that
the
charge
of
the
court
was
just
as
confusing
as
the
indictment
itself.
accordingly,
we
request
that
this
court
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
proper
appellate
jurisdiction
to
review
the
dismissal
--
the
denial
of
the
motion
is
dismissed,
reversed,
the
court
of
appeals
with
--
and
remand
with
instructions
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
couple
of
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
turning
first
to
the
last
comments
of
--
of
the
attorney
general.
the
indictment
here
is
reproduced
at
page
9
of
the
appendix
and
it
--
it
only
takes
up
a--
a
short
--
excuse
me.
i
may
have
--
page
5
of
the
appendix.
it
only
takes
up
a
little
bit
more
than
a
page
and
that
it
really
is
very
instructive
to
read
that
indictment
because
that
indictment
does
not
charge,
properly
charge
a
conspiracy.
it
does
not
charge
any
agreement.
it
charges
a
conspiracy
and
attempt
by
attempt.
there
is
no
language
in
there
to
suggest
in
anyway
that
these
defendants
agreed
to
commit
an
attempt.
they
charge
they
attempt
it.
it
doesn't
say
that
they
attempt
it
together,
that
they
agreed
to
attempt
they
--
that
they
--
they
conspire
in
any
way,
except
the
--
the
single
bare
word
conspiracy.
for
that
reason,
we
believe
that
the
indictment
fails
to
state
an
offense
because
now
with
the
attempt
portion
of
the
charge
deleted,
it
charges
a
conspiracy
to
commit
attempted
extortion,
which
we
have
noted
is
not
a
crime
under
the
hobbs
act.
the
--
the
charge
of
the
court
cannot,
we
--
we
submit,
correct
the
deficiencies
of
the
duplicitous
indictment.
the
charge
at
page
22
of
the
appendix
talks
about
the
charge
against
each
individual
defendant.
now,
here,
we
have
two
separate
charges.the
court
lumps
them
together
as
the
charge.he
then
goes
on.
on
page
26
of
the
appendix,
the
offense
charged,
lumps
them
together
again
and
so
forth
throughout
the
remaining
part
of
the
charge
of
the
court.
now,
the
--
the
position
of
the
--
of
the
petitioners
is
that
--
that
where
there
are
two
separate
charges,
where
there
is
a
duplicitous
indictment
to
lump
them
together
as
one,
creates
something
which
is
incognizable
by
the
jury.
it
--
the
jury
is
considering
something
which
is
completely
separate
from
the
two
crimes
charged.
they're
--
they
are
asked
to
consider
something
which
is
--
which
is
not
within
the
province
of
the
criminal
law.
turning
back
to
the
appealability
question,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
--
that
the
petitioners
here
are
not
trying
to
get
into
the
third
circuit.
they
are
not
testing
their
right
to
appeal.
they
were
there.
the
question
is,
did
the
third
circuit
have
appropriate
and
proper
federal
jurisdiction
to
consider
their
claims
and
--
and
that
i
think
is
an
--
an
important
question.
the
--
in
reaching
that
question,
the
question
of
finality
becomes
very
important
whether
or
not
it
is
a
final
decision.
and
in
stack
versus
boyle,
very
similar
situation
to
this
where
bail
was
considered
to
be
a
final
decision
and
reviewable
pre-trial
and
whether
or
not
the
trial
went
on
before
the
appellate
court
reached
that,
made
no
difference.
the
fact
is,
is
that
the
--
the
appellants
in
stack
versus
boyle
had
a
right
to
have
the
appellate
court
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
bail
was
excessive.
in
harris
versus
washington,
here,
i
think
harris
is
a
very
important
case
here.
albeit
in
utilizing
the
state
courts,
but
the
--
it
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
double
jeopardy
grounds
in
the
trial
court
which
was
denied.
a
writ
of
prohibition
was
entered
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
reversed
by
the
state
supreme
court.
so,
this
court
had
before
it
only
one
issue
whether
or
not
the
denial
of
a
--
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
double
jeopardy
grounds
was
a
final
judgment
in
the
words
of
that
statute,
for
purposes
of
review.
and
as
we
pointed
and
as
the
government
agrees,
the
criteria
for
final
judgment
and
final
decision
are
the
same
and
have
been
held
to
be
the
same.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
i'm
not
sure
that
--
that
i
understand
the
question
exactly,
but
the
--
the
--
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
where
--
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
it's
certainly
clear
--
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
it's
certainly
clear
where
the
government
seeks
to
retrial
on
the
same
indictment.
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
where
there
is
a
--
a
question
of
collateral
estoppel,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
if
the
indictment
is
properly
framed
so
as
to
adequately
advise
the
defendant
of
the
charge
against
him
that
it
can
be
--
that
the
defendant
at
that
point
can
make
the
double
jeopardy
claim.
and
--
mr.
ralph
david
samuel
i
--
i'm
not
sure
that
i
have
that
much
familiarity
with
the
potential
possibilities
here
to
--
to
discuss
that,
but
that's
not
the
case
here.
here,
we
have
attempted
re-trial
on
the
same
indictment
and
accordingly,
we
request
that
the
court
grant
the
requested
relief.
thank
you.
