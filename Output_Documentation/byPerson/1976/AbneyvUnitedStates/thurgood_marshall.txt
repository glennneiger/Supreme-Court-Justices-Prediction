justice
thurgood
marshall
which
you
understand
as
a
criminal
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
samuel,
are
you
just
abandoning
the
language
of
the
fifth
amendment?
it
doesn't
say
you
can
be
convicted,
so
you
shall
not
be
put
in
jeopardy.
you
could
say
you
shall
not
be
convicted.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
going
to
get
to
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
if
luckily
if
--
if
we
decide
that
there's
no
double
jeopardy
point
here,
we
then
move
to
the
other
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
now
anytime
you
fail
to
get
an
indictment
dismissed,
you
say
double
jeopardy
and
automatically
it's
appealable.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
they
ever
have
jurisdiction
in
that
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
they
find
that
there
was
no
double
jeopardy
claim?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
they
go
to
the
other
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
where
does
it
get
that
discretion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
from
the
fact
that
you
alleged
double
jeopardy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
no
more?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
part
of
the
law.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
anything
to
back
you
up
on
that,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
that
this
case
raised
the
question,
the
important
question
of
whether
or
not
you
could
appeal
the
denial
of
the
double
jeopardy
point,
without
getting
involved
with
the
rest
of
it.
i'm
wrong.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
--
if
we
give
you
relief
on
the
double
jeopardy,
what
do
you
need
the
other
one
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
you
need
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
you
have
a
grand
jury
indictment
with
two
grand
jurors
in
it.
could
you
bring
that
one
up
straight?
no,
you'll
have
to
go
through
a
trial,
wouldn't
you?
wouldn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
to
raise
the
question
of
denial
or
motion
for
a
bill
of
particulars
or
something
like
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
remedy
the
fact
that
the
man
was
put
in
jeopardy,
which
is
the
language
in
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
prevent
a
court
from
violating
an
expressed
provision
of
the
constitution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
constitution
says,
“you
shall
not
start
that
process.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
that
say
jeopardy
and
where
do
you
see
that
in
the
constitution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
talking
about
language
expressly
in
the
constitution.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
rules
of
evidence
are
not
in
the
constitution.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this,
we
don't
have
to
interpret
jeopardy,
do
we?
we
know
where
jeopardy
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
congress
--
and
the
constitution
says
no
jeopardy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
court
says,
“we
will
put
this
man
in
jeopardy
and
there's
no
way
of
stopping
that.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
thornburgh,
assuming
not
uncommon
18-month
trials
that
a
double
jeopardy
claim
is
made,
and
in
if
its
appeal,
would
it
not
only
save
the
defendant?
wouldn't
also
save
the
government?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
ask
a
thing
about
congress
or
the
statutes
at
all.
i
asked
you
a
question
of
fact.
if
there
was
a
clear-cut,
double
jeopardy
point
that
you
and
everybody
else
knew
was
there,
wouldn't
it
be
better
to
get
it
over
with?
i
think
the
answer
is,
that
if
it
was
a
good
one
you
just
wouldn't
proceed.you'd
save
your
money.
but
if
it
was
a
question
where
one,
you'd
make
the
defendant
go
out
and
pay
the
money
for
his
lawyers
and
everything
else.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
evaporated
milk
has
got
more
money
than
the
average
defendant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
is
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
is
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
none
--
you
don't
have
any
non-legal
ground
for
supporting
your
argument
like
saving
money
or
anything
like
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you're
not
to
say
anything
about
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
say
are
you?
