justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
that
case,
the
state
appellate
system
had
permitted
appellate
review
of
the
dismissal
order
and
isn't
that
really
the
question
here
whether
the
federal
appellate
system
permits
review
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
there's
a
policy
against
piecemeal
appeals
in
the
federal
system,
that
policy
may
or
may
not
be
followed
by
the
states
and
if
they'd
choose
or
chosen
to
allow
their
process
to
be
interrupted
by
appellate
review
of
this
kind
of
an
issue,
that's
up
to
them.
but
i
take
it
the
argument
of
the
other
side
is
that
the
federal
policy
is
against
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
that
involve
a
judgment
on
our
part
as
to
how
the
third
circuit
should
have
exercised
its
discretionary
power
to
grant
or
deny
mandamus?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
court
--
you're
referring
to
courts
of
appeals'
cases
where
the
same
court
in
which
the
appeal
was
filed
says,
“no,
we
don't
have
appellate
jurisdiction
but
we
choose
to
treat
is
as
a
petition
for
mandamus
and
exercise
our
jurisdiction
to
allow
it.
if
--
if
you
ask
us
to
do
that,
that
it's
--
it's
one
level
removed
because
you
would
say,
“we're
saying
the
court
of
appeals
has
no
jurisdiction
but
that
it
should
have
exercised
its
discretionary
jurisdiction.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
thornburgh,
supposing
that
a
motion
similar
to
the
one
made
in
this
case
was
made
in
the
district
court
and
the
district
judge,
rather
than
denying
it
simply
said,
“i'm
going
to
take
it
under
advisement
but
i
think
it's
fairly
debatable,”
and
kept
it
under
advisement
until
the
end
of
the
trial.
do
you
suppose
that
the
defendant
would
have
had
any
constitutional
right
to
get
a
writ
of
mandamus
from
the
third
circuit?
