mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
since
the
government
deems
the
issue
of
appealability
to
be
the
most
important
of
those
raised
in
this
case,
i
would
like
to
defer
the
statement
of
our
position
on
the
other
substantive
issues
unless
and
until
the
court
otherwise
desires.
it's
the
position
of
the
government
in
this
case
that
the
interruption
of
the
trial
process
by
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
not
justified.
that
court
was
without
jurisdiction
to
hear
an
appeal
from
an
order
denying
dismissal
on
double
jeopardy
grounds
before
the
case
was
retried
following
its
reversal.
the
right
to
appeal
is
a
statutory
one,
not
a
constitutional
right.
it
arises
in
this
case
under
the
provisions
of
title
28
usc
§
1291
which
provides
for
a
right
of
appeal
only
of
final
decisions
in
the
district
court.
as
pointed
out
in
our
brief
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
i
think
in
the
colloquial
sense,
final
decisions
are
made
by
the
district
court
in
a
whole
panoply
of
matters
in
the
course
of
hearing
a
trial.
the
question
is
whether
it
is
a
final
decision
as
the
courts
have
interpreted
that
phrase
under
1291,
and
i
would
suggest
that
beginning
with
a
line
of
authority
that's
founded
in
the
hickey
case
that
in
matters
respecting
double
jeopardy,
there
has
been
with
the
exception
of
the
cases
that
bring
us
here
today
from
the
circuit
courts,
a
recognition
by
this
court
that
a
double
jeopardy
claim
denial
is
not
final,
a
final
decision
for
the
purposes
of
being
appealable.
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
i
would
submit
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
well,
i
think,
mr.
justice
marshall,
what
we
are
talking
about
here
and
it's
--
and
it's
important,
i
think,
to
state,
is
not
a
denial
of
a
right
of
appeal
but
the
timing
of
that
appeal,
whether
that
appeal
is
to
be
permitted
to
interrupt
the
flow
of
the
criminal
justice
process.
there
are
any
number
of
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
and
the
constitution
says
indeed
that
no
legally
obtained
evidence
shall
be
used
against
a
defendant
that
he
shall
not
be
brought
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
where
do
i
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
well,
that
is
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
no,
they
have
interpreted
to
--
have
been
interpreted
by
this
court.
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
we
know
where
jeopardy
is,
we
know
that
jeopardy
attaches
when
the
trial
takes
place.
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
but
the
right
of
appeal
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
there
is
a
right.
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
yes
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
the
fourth
circuit
has
so
held
in
that
case
is
of
great
concern
to
the
government
with
regard
to
the
finality
doctrine.
i
think
that
with
respect
to
the
double
jeopardy
issue,
i
recognize
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
succumbed
to
what
judge
friendly
refers
to
as
the
seductive
argument
that
the
--
that
the
--
the
right
of
not
being
placed
in
jeopardy
twice
is
not
a
meaningful
right
unless
it
has
a
handmaiden
of
pretrial
appeal
to
a
company
it.
but
i
think
that
that
represents
a
misreading
of
the
lines
of
authority
that
have
been
developed
in
this
court,
not
only
under
the
cohen
doctrine
of
collateral
decisions
but
the
state
cases
which
are
relied
upon
by
petitioner
here.
with
respect
to
cohen,
that
case
was
really
the
--
the
first
breach
in
the
application
of
the
finality
doctrine.
and
when
you
look
at
the
facts
of
that
case,
which
involved
a
shareholder
suit
upon
which
the
--
with
respect
to
which
the
district
court
had
to
decide
a
question
of
cause
on
the
petitioner,
and
that
question
was
then
reviewed
in
the
appellate
courts.
this
court
found
ultimately
in
cohen
in
its
decision
that
that
was
one
of
what
they
styled
a
small
class
of
cases
where
a
determination
is
made
of
claims
of
right
which
are
separable
from
and
collateral
to
the
rights
asserted
in
that
particular
civil
action.that
it
was
too
important
to
be
denied
review
and
in
fact,
would
be
lost
itself
if
it
were
not
decided
at
that
time.
it's
analog
in
the
--
in
the
criminal
area
is
stack
v.
boyle
involving
a
determination
of
bail
in
a
criminal
case,
again.
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
well,
i
think
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
because
i
don't
think
the
--
the
double
jeopardy
issue
is
separable
from
and
collateral
to
the
rights
to
assert
in
the
action.
the
double
jeopardy
issue
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
entire
package
of
decisions
on
factual
and
legal
matters
that
have
to
be
decided
in
the
case
on
its
trial
and
has
to
be,
as
in
hickey
with
the
so-called
right
not
to
be
tried
once
transactional
immunity
had
been
granted
has
to
await
the
determination
of
the
trial
and
all
of
its
issues
so
that
piecemeal
review
will
give
way
to
a
consideration
of
that
entire
package
upon
appellate
review.
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
well,
i
would
submit
that
at
that
time,
it
might
well
have
been
thought
to
encompass
such
a
right
because
it
--
the
statute
was
a
substitute
for
the
fifth
amendment
right,
which
prohibits
the
use
of
testimony
in
an
incriminating
sense.
so
i
think
that
there
is
a
--
as
the
court
noted
in
hickey,
a
distinct
parallel
to
the
transactional
immunity
argument
and
the
double
jeopardy
argument.
indeed,
the
court
in
hickey
noted
and
more
or
less
assumed
that
a
--
a
claim
of
double
jeopardy
would
be
treated
in
the
same
way.
that
is,
that
--
that
it
would
not
have
the
affect
of
interrupting
the
process
but
would
have
to
await
determination
of
the
case
itself.
now,
hickey,
in
a
sense,
i
would
submit,
if
it
--
it
remains
good
law
today
and
we
urge
that
it
does,
really
answers
the
questions
that
are
raised
in
this
case.
i
think
what
has
happened
that
the
development
that
brings
us
to
the
consideration
of
the
double
jeopardy
question
out
of
the
circuits
today
represents
the
false
sense
that
have
been
followed
in
a
number
of
circuit
courts
which
have
lead
them,
on
the
basis
of
cohen,
into
a
path
of
error.
i
think,
as
i
mentioned
first
of
all,
they
have
looked
at
the
seductive
argument
of
the
uniqueness
of
double
jeopardy
drawing
on
cases
like
ball
and
green
which
contained
descriptive
language
about
the
double
jeopardy
right
which
are
unassailable,
but
said
not
in
the
context
of
the
appealability
of
a
pre-trial
order
denying
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
double
jeopardy
grounds.
this
is
an
argument
that
was
really
first
raised
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
gilmore
where
now,
chief
judge
brown,
noted
that
all
appeal
rights
are
statutory
and
not
constitutional
and
then
continued
in
dealing
with
double
jeopardy
as
follows
and
i
quote,
“there
are
many
instances
in
which
it
is
ultimately
determined
that
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated,
but
the
nature
of
the
asserted
right,
that
is
to
say,
a
constitutional
one,
does
not
distinguish
appellate
review
of
any
such
question
from
the
assertion
of
other
rights,
whether
statutory
or
common
law
or
from
a
procedural
rule.
at
least,
so
long
as
a
criminal
case
is
pending,
review
of
such
matters
as
for
example,
unlawful
search
and
seizure,
unlawful
arrest,
unlawful
detention,
unlawful
indictment,
unlawful
confession
must
await
the
trial
and
its
outcome.”
the
fourth
circuit
in
lansdown
disagreed
and
enunciated
a
view
of
cohen
which
has
found
double
jeopardy
claims
to
be
collateral
in
the
cohen
sense
and
in
gender,
the
line
of
cases
that
bring
us
here
today.
the
premise
on
which
these
holdings
of
the
courts
of
appeal
rely
has
not
been
examined
in
this
court
since
hickey,
and
needless
to
say,
it
has
not
occasioned
any
action
by
the
congress
to
extend
the
scope
of
review
of
interlocutory
orders.
i
think,
when
you
examine
the
rationale
in
lansdown,
in
the
fourth
circuit,
against
the
rationale
expressed
for
denying
these
rights
of
interlocutory
appeal
in
cobbledick,
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
of
1940,
the
deficiency
in
the
courts
of
appeals'
reasoning
appears.
that
is
to
say,
in
lansdown,
the
court
said,
“even
if
an
appellate
court
reverses
the
conviction
in
a
second
trial
on
the
grounds
of
double
jeopardy,
a
defendant
has
still
not
been
afforded
the
full
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
since
he
has
been
subjected
to
the
embarrassment,
expense,
anxiety
and
insecurity
involved
in
the
second
trial.”
compare
this
with
justice
frankfurter's
language
in
cobbledick
where
he
said
to
the
point,
“bearing
the
discomfiture
and
cost
of
a
prosecution
for
crime
even
by
an
innocent
person
is
one
of
the
painful
obligations
of
citizenship.”
that
is
a
painful
document
–
doctrine,
i
will
acknowledge,
but
as
pointed
out
by
judge
brown,
there
are
numerous
cases
where
an
error
can
be
made
by
the
district
court
that
will
occasion
embarrassment,
expense,
anxiety
and
insecurity
to
a
defendant
who
later
obtains
a
reversal
of
a
conviction
that
was
obtained
through
error.
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
that
is
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
indeed,
it
does
but
the
question
remains
as
to
whether
there
is
a
statutory
right
to
vindicate
that
constitutional
right
before
the
trial
has
taken
place.
there
is
no
question
and
i
urge
again
that
we
not
fall
into
the
error
that
i
find
myself
sometimes
into
thinking
that
we
are
talking
about
whether
there
exists
a
right
of
double
jeopardy.
what
i
submit
we
are
just
examining
is
whether
there
is
a
statutory
right.
indeed,
where
there
was
once
no
right
to
appeal
in
a
criminal
case,
the
question
becomes,
do
we
have
now
a
statutory
right
that
encompasses
the
vindication
of
a
double
jeopardy
claim
prior
to
trial.
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
i
think,
in
all
probability,
that
the
judge
would
have
the
power
to
that.
it's
frequently
done
in
my
experience
on
matters
that
are
raised
pre-trial
or
during
the
trial
and
having
the
power
to
do
so,
i
would
see
no
reason
why
the
extraordinary
writ
would
issue
in
the
face
of
the
exercise
of
that
power.
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
well,
i
--
i
think
there
--
there
certainly
would
be
the
power
to
do
so,
in
the
--
in
the
egregious
case
but
it
would
--
it
would
not
reach
the
question
of
the
power
of
the
district
court
to
defer
consideration
of
such
a
motion
until
the
end
of
the
trial.
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
i
suppose
that
such
a
prospect
could
result,
but
i
would
submit
that
that's
something
that
the
congress
could
well
take
into
consideration?
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
well,
i
think
this
court
so
held
in
roche
against
evaporated
milk
association
where
that
very
point
was
--
was
raised
in
an
antitrust
case.
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
i
think
that's
right,
mr.
justice
marshall.
i'm
not
going
to
argue
about
evaporated
milk
against
the
ordinary
defendant
or
the
defendant
in
this
case,
but
i
submit
that
that
kind
of
an
argument,
given
the
statutory
framework
within
which
rights
of
appeal
in
criminal
cases
exist
is
one
that
must,
of
necessity,
be
decided
in
the
congress
by
a
balancing
of
an
empirical
assessment
of
evaporated
milk
against
the
number
of
--
of
cases
where
appeal
has
been
taken
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
--
on
double
jeopardy
grounds
that
are
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
--
frivolous.
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
i
have
--
i
have
a
great
many
non-legal
grounds
i
think
your
--
if
--
if
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
i
should
not
assert
them?
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
i
--
i
will
assert
them,
yes.
i
think
that
the
problem
here
is
one
of
judicial
administration
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
noted
in
the
cobbledick
case,
the
theory
of
piecemeal
review
is
not
consonant
with
sound
judicial
administration.
i
don't
want
to
be
involved
in
parading
horribles
before
this
court
on
this
monday
morning,
but
one
can
easily
foresee
from
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
in
the
wake
of
these
circuit
court
decisions
that
relate
to
the
appealability
of
double
jeopardy
cases,
that
we
are
going
to
be
faced
with
claims,
at
least,
that
will
rise
to
the
circuit
courts
and
eat
up
the
time
that
they
have
available
to
consider
appellate
matters
in
areas
such
as
the
speedy
trial
provisions
of
the
constitution.mcdonald
has
done
that.
in
the
leslie
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
well,
i
would
obviously
urge
that
this
court
not
open
this
pandora's
box
because
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
--
i
think
these
are
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
i
think
the
--
the
real
difference
between
this
and
cohen
is
that
cohen
involved,
as
did
the
--
the
bailey
case,
a
kind
of
a
turn
style
phenomenon.
that
is
the
cause
of
the
case,
the
amount
of
bail
are
clearly
separable
from
the
kind
of
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
well,
it
would
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
well,
that
was
looking
it
as
a
practical
matter?
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
that
may
well
be
so.
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
well,
i
think
that
again
i
--
i
get
back
to
the
point
of
the
easy
equivalency
of
the
existence
of
the
double
jeopardy
right
in
the
constitution
and
the
right
to
pre-trial
appeal.
there
are
--
i
again,
submit
on
the
basis
of
judge
brown's
litany
of
--
of
cases
that
might
occasion
equally
serious
constitutional
depredations.
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
well
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
--
i
would
--
i
would
urge
that
if
we
are
to
look
at
the
practical
aspects
of
the
case
in
cohen
that
we
should
also
look
at
the
practical
aspects
of
the
case
in
a
criminal
case.
that
is
to
say,
the
double
jeopardy
right
might
pale
in
--
in
comparison
with
a
supposed
egregious
error
on
the
question
of
admissibility
of
evidence
of
constitutionality
of
a
particular
statute
under
which
the
individual
is
charged
whether
he
had
been
given
proper
warnings,
whether
he
had
been
tortured
or
confession
had
been
extracted
from.
i
think
if
we
look
at
the
practical
side,
although
your
suggestion
in
cohen
that
there
any
number
of
--
of
problems
which
would
rise
to
the
level
of
the
double
jeopardy
claim.
and
again,
reverting
to
the
--
the
basic
framework
within
which
appellate
rights
exist,
it
still
does
not
deal
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
congress
has
seen
fit
to
provide
in
this
type
of
case
knowledgeable
of
the
developments
in
cobbledick,
dibella,
hickey
and
the
like,
any
kind
of
pre-trial
appeal
for
the
denial
of
double
jeopardy
of
the
type
involved
in
this
case.
i
--
i'd
like
to
deal
briefly
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
it's
--
it's
been
so
held
and
i
think
that's
the
second
thread
that
has
lead
the
circuit
courts
in
--
in
these
cases
in
the
order
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
well,
they
are,
if
i
might
say,
apples
and
oranges.
the
state
determination
of
the
federal
issue
is
final
because
it's
the
only
federal
issue.
whereas
in
the
cases
that
come
out
of
the
federal
courts,
there
is
a
vast
catalogue
of
federal
issues
that
could
be
presented
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
well,
in
having
run
its
course
and
reach
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
well,
i
think
again
what
we
get
back
to
is
--
is
the
difference
between
the
two
systems
that
if
the
state
has
countenance
stay
threshold
arrival
of
this
issue,
this
federal
issue
at
its
highest
court
level
that
this
court
is
in
entitled
to
determine
that
that
is
final
for
state
purposes
and
therefore,
appropriate
under
1257
for
appeal
in
this
court.
but
the
specter
of
which
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
well
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
that
--
that
--
i
think
that
the
--
the
former
issue
has
been
present
in
every
case
that
this
court
has
decided
on
that
issue.
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
i
--
i
was
--
i
was
going
to
say
that
but
i
--
i
–
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
one
could
conceive
of
a
state
equivalent
of
2255
or
other
types
of
things
that
might
raise
constitutional
issues
to
be
sure.
but
in
the
course
of
that
particular
litigation,
litigative
track,
it
is
final
and
for
state
purposes
and
right
for
appeal,
i
--
i
would
analyze
under
1257
as
distinguished
from
what
we're
dealing
with
under
1291.
and
i
think
those
state
cases
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
yeah.
i
--
i
must
say
i
--
i
don't
know
how
to
assess
that.
i
--
there
is,
i
realize,
a
treatment
of
that
difference
in
--
in
decisions
of
this
court
but
i
--
i
can't
divine
any
difference
that
would
produce
a
more
favorable
treatment
or
one
way
or
another.
i
would
urge
that
the
--
the
language
be
treated
as
its
equivalent.
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
that
was
the
reference
suggested
by
judge
friendly.
i
--
i
don't
know,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
i
don't
know.
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
i
think
that
what
the
courts
of
appeals
have
found
to
be
the
lynchpin
for
deviating
from
the
finality
rule
in
criminal
cases
has
been
the
nature
of
double
jeopardy.
but
i
--
i
don't
--
i
urge
on
this
court
that
it
is
not
a
distinguishable
factor
from
a
broad
variety
of
other
serious
constitutional
problems
which
might
be
justice
apt
to
candidates
for
pretrial
review
if
one
is
to
indulge
oneself
in
permitting
that
kind
of
review.
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
i
think
that
the
--
let's
say,
distinction
without
a
difference
in
--
in
my
view.
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
well,
that
could
only
be
determined
after
the
second
conviction
had
been
obtained
and
that
was
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
then
it
--
no.
certainly,
then
it
is
appropriate
for
review
because
the
process
has
played
itself
out
--
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
that
i
must
revert
to
seeing
a
--
a
distinction
without
difference
because
the
claim
is
anticipatory
until
the
trial
plays
itself
out.
he
may
be
acquitted.
the
trial
may
abort
for
some
other
reason.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
a
particularly
persuasive
addition
to
the
argument
with
respect
to
exposure
to
trial.
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
i
would
like
to
take
my
remaining
time
to
address
the
merits,
briefly.
the
case
as
presented
by
the
petitioner
states
that
because
of
the
duplicity
of
the
indictment,
it
is
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
to
determine
what
the
verdict
was
in
the
first
trial.
i
think
a
search
of
the
record,
particularly
the
charge
of
the
court
in
this
case,
with
its
final
words
to
the
jury
being
emphasized,
makes
it
clear
that
what
the
government
was
doing
here
was
not
overreaching
as
the
petitioner
alleges
but
underreaching.
they
were
setting
a
task
much
greater
for
themselves,
which
i
would
certainly
not
want
to
do
of
securing
convictions
on
both
of
these
offenses.
the
trial
judge
defined
the
statute
in
terms
of
conspiracy
or
attempt
and
then
proceeded
to
charge
on
the
necessity
of
convicting
for
conspiracy
and
attempt,
even
going
to
the
length
in
his
last
words
to
the
jury
of
pointing
out
that
both
of
those
offenses
had
to
be,
result
in
conviction.
i
don't
think
that
we
can
assume
that
the
jury
did
not
follow
those
instructions.
the
colloquy
which
is
relied
upon
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner
was
not
communicated
to
the
jury
and
i
think
what
we
must
do
is
--
is
to
look
at
those
instructions
that
were
given
to
the
jury
and
they
clearly
indicate
that
they
were
under
an
--
a
charge
to
convict
of
both
offenses,
conspiracy
and
attempt.
and
in
that
event,
it
strikes
me
that
we
--
we
need
proceed
no
further.
now,
with
respect
to
the
statement
of
an
offense,
the
so-called
pendent
claim,
if
one
refers
to
the
brief
and
our
analysis
of
the
hobbs
act,
the
--
the
charge,
it's
--
it
seems
clear
that
the
acts
of
what
is
charged
is
that
the
acts
amounting
to
attempted
extortion
were
performed
in
furtherance
of
a
properly
alleged
conspiracy
and
that
there
was
no
failure
to
charge
in
the
terms
of
the
hobbs
act.
so,
that
i
think
that
when
we
do
get
to
the
merits
after
this
trail
regarding
the
appealability
of
pre-trial,
that
we
find,
indeed,
that
if
this
is
the
type
of
claim
that
is
going
to
inject
itself
into
our
appellate
process,
willy-nilly,
on
a
piecemeal
basis,
we
will
suffer
considerable
delay
and
misuse
of
appellate
time.
mr.
richard
l.
thornburgh
absolutely
not.
