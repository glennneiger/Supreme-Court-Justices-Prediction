do
you
have
some
authority
for
that
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
argue
from
judge
friendly's
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
it's
appealable
or
that
it
isn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
argue
from
judge
friendly's
opinion
as
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
also
that
even
if
there
is
jurisdiction
to
review
the
double
jeopardy
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
the
duplicity
issue
would
piggy
back
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
if
they
weren't,
if
the
--
the
double
jeopardy
question
weren't
there,
you
certainly
wouldn't
argue
the
duplicity
--
the
duplicity
issue
was
appealable
by
itself.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
would
you
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
then
take
that
one
too,
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
denial
of
that,
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
an
indictment
for
failure
to
state
an
offense?
now,
is
that
an
appealable
issue
or
not
by
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
thornburgh,
is
it
not
correct
that
the
district
court
has
made
a
final
decision
on
the
question
whether
the
defendant
must
stand
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
other
words,
why
doesn't
cohen
fit
this
case
like
a
glove
if
one
can
say
that
cohen's
theory
applies
to
the
criminal
side?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
hickey
did
not
involve
a
right
based
in
the
constitution,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
--
it
is
a
painful
obligation
of
citizenship
perhaps
to
be
tried
once,
but
the
constitution
makes
very
clear
that
it's
not
a
painful
obligation
to
be
tried
the
second
time
after
you've
been
convicted
or
acquitted
the
first
time.
that's
the
big
difference
between
what
you
read
to
us
and
the
case
now
before
us.
justice
byron
r.
white
they've
all
been
tried
twice
and
that's
what
the
constitution
makes
very
clear
is
not
a
painful
obligation
of
citizenship.
the
constitution
protects
against
precisely
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
take
the
same
position,
general
thornburgh,
if
the
double
jeopardy
issue
was
that
this
that
the
--
not
that
he
was
subjected
to
another
trial
but
that
he
was
being
subjected
to
a
second
conviction
for
the
same
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
pardon
me?
because
after
all
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
a
--
say
it,
it
does
talk
about
double
jeopardy
but
it
certainly
is
the
aims
--
it
also
aims
at
preventing
double
convictions
or
double
punishments
for
the
same
--
same
crime,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
--
that
was
i
said.
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
the
same
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
but
at
--
at
--
before
the
trial.
before
the
second
trial,
the
claim
may
have
--
the
defendant
says,
“i
don't
mind.
i'm
not
objecting
to
having
to
go
to
trial.
my
object
is
the
fact
that
i'm
threatened
with
another
conviction
for
what
i
claim
is
the
same
kind
as
i
was
convicted
last
week
for.”
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
take
it
your
position
is
though,
that
even
if
the
--
even
if
the
double
jeopardy
issue
is
appealable,
the
others
aren't?
