justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
stole
an
automobile
from
a
parking
lot
in
east
cleveland,
ohio.
nine
days
later,
he
was
arrested
while
driving
the
car
in
wickliffe,
ohio.
he
was
convicted
there
of
joyriding
that
is
of
operating
a
motor
vehicle
without
the
owner's
consent.
after
setting
a
30-day
sentence,
petitioner
also
was
convicted
in
east
cleveland
on
a
more
serious
charge
of
theft
of
the
same
car.
although
petitioner
raised
the
double
jeopardy
issue
to
his
second
prosecution,
his
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
and
we
granted
certiorari.
the
double
jeopardy
clause
provides
that
no
person
shall
be
a
subject
to
the
same
offense
to
be
twice
put
in
jeopardy
of
life
or
limb.
under
ohio
law
as
construed
in
this
case,
the
crime
of
theft
includes
all
of
the
elements
of
the
lesser
offense
of
joyriding.
we
affirmed
today
the
rule
that
two
offenses
related
in
this
manner
are
the
same
for
the
purposes
of
the
double
jeopardy
guarantee.
as
petitioner
was
placed
twice
in
jeopardy
for
his
single
offense,
we
reversed
his
conviction.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
marshall
has
joined.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and

justice
rehnquist
have
joined.
