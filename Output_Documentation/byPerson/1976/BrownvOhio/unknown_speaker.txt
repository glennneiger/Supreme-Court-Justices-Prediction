unknown
speaker
does
that
offense
require
proof
of
intent
to
steal?
unknown
speaker
does
the
second
charge
require
proof
of
intent?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
ohio
legislature
had
in
act
in
the
statue
that
prohibited
the
driving
of
a
car
without
the
concern
of
the
owner
put
in
a
provision
that
each
day
on
which
this
offense
occur
shall
be
a
separate
offense?
unknown
speaker
regulatory
type
offense.
unknown
speaker
is
there
some
constitutional
calculus
that
enables
us
to
way
the
valid
state
interest
behind
ordinances
that
prohibit
the
emission
of
noxious
fumes
as
opposed
to
driving
cars
without
consent,
so
that
one
might
be
a
stricter
application
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
than
the
other?
unknown
speaker
what
if
i
borrow
your
car
on
october
1st
and
say,
i
will
return
it
to
you
on
october
2nd
and
i
do
not
return
it
to
you
on
october
2nd.
i
take
it
under
ohio
law
and
on
october
3rd
i
am
guilty
of
driving
without
your
consent?
unknown
speaker
the
longer
i
put
off
returning
that
car
to
you
in
accordance
of
my
promise;
do
not
you
suffer
a
greater
wrong?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
losing
the
use
of
your
car
for
a
longer
period
time
in
a
very
tangible
economic
sense,
are
not
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
goes
to
the
question
whether
they
provided
that
each
day
was
a
separate
offend,
but
i
thought
you
were
making
the
additional
argument
that
even
if
they
put
in
such
a
provision,
well
this
court
would
have
to
weigh
how
valid
it
was
to
make
that
kind
of
a
provision
and
how
arbitrary
the
legislature
had
acted
in
doing
so.
unknown
speaker
mr.
plautz
what
would
you
do
if
they
arrested
the
man
for
the
use
of
the
car
and
he
explained
well
i
was
just
a
young
kid
and
i
was
going
in
for
a
little
joyride
and
he
has
given
30
days
in
the
sentence
and
they
found
out
later
that
he
is
a
leader
of
a
stolen
car
ring?
he
could
not
be
prosecuted,
could
he,
out
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
i
know
nothing
about
that
first
statute,
it
was
not
meant
to
cover
people
that
had
a
car
for
ten
days.
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
it
was
meant,
it
is
a
joyride
in
the
statute
and
that
is
what
it
is
called.
unknown
speaker
if
the
kid
just
took
it
for
a
ride
not
ten
days?
unknown
speaker
well,
couldn't
the
jury
infer
from
the
recital
of
the
facts
that
you
have
just
given
that
he
did
not
form
the
intent
of
steal
it
when
he
kept
it
for
the
whole
year.
unknown
speaker
it
was
not
raised
in
any
pretrial
attack
on
the
indictment.
unknown
speaker
would
you
address
my
question?
unknown
speaker
did
a
challenged
the
indictment
pretrial?
unknown
speaker
on
this
ground?
unknown
speaker
no,
on
attacking
this
problem
of
the
date?
unknown
speaker
but
in
effect
it
held
that
this
--
as
i
understand
their
opinion,
they
held
that
this
particular
operating
of
the
vehicle
without
the
owner’s
consent
was
not
a
lesser
included
offense
of
the
stealing
because
they
were
not
the
same
actor
in
the
same
transaction
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
what
they
held
and
in
this
particular
case,
it
was
not
a
lesser
included
offense
that
is
what
they
held?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
it
is
just
as
though
two
entire
different
cars
were
involved
in
so
far
as
their
concern.
so
it
is
although
theoretically
i
mean
although
operating
the
vehicle
without
the
owner’s
consent
is
a
lesser
included
offense,
we
are
talking
about
the
same
day
and
the
same
car.
in
this
case
they
just
held
the
contrary,
you
said,
it
was
not
the
same
act
at
all.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
had
responded
to
one
question
of
that
intent,
proof
of
intent
is
not
an
element
of
the
so
called
joyriding,
an
offense
and
the
proof
of
intent
to
steal
is
required
in
the
second.
unknown
speaker
then
would
you
explain
how
they
are
same?
unknown
speaker
just
because
it’s
the
same
automobile?
unknown
speaker
the
criminal
law
does
not
punish
you
just
for
conduct,
as
it
punishes
sometimes
for
conduct
and
sometimes
for
conduct
accompanied
by
intent,
a
specific
intent
crime.
unknown
speaker
that
it
will
still
not
be
lost.
unknown
speaker
perhaps
he
confided
that
to
you
that
he
had
the
intent
all
the
time,
but
on
this
record
how
do
we
find
that
out?
unknown
speaker
on
this
record,
you
conceded
that
the
prosecution
have
no
obligation
to
show
intent
on
the
joyriding
charge.
they
did
not
have
an
obligation
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
intent
to
steal
on
the
second
charge.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
did
and
they
must
have
carried
it
apparently
or
you
would
not
be
here.
unknown
speaker
now,
if
you
are
writing
in
your
primary
argument
that
upon
conviction
of
a
lesser
included
offense
and
you
could
not
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
be
even
be
prosecuted
for
the
greater
offense
than
the
additional
punishment
you
do
not
get
into,
it
is
a
violation
of
constitution
even
to
recharge
with
the
greater
offense.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
that
was
your
argument.
i
am
not
saying
it
is
true.
i
thought
that
was
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
are
making
the
same
basic
argument
that
was
made
in
the
previous
case
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
as
a
general
rule
prohibited
a
prosecution
for
a
greater
offense
after
conviction
for
a
lesser
included
offense.
unknown
speaker
are
you
making
that
argument
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
the
matter
of
dual
punishment
doesn’t
as
you
don’t
get
to
it
if
it’s
a
constitutional
violation
even
to
prosecute.
unknown
speaker
another
aspect
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
guarantee
against
dual
punishments
for
the
same
offense.
unknown
speaker
man
stole
a
car
in
ohio
and
drove
it
to
california
and
they
picked
him
up
in
california
for
joyriding,
couldn’t
ohio
try
him
for
stealing?
unknown
speaker
and
so
the
difference
between
that
case
and
your
case
is
both
of
them
happened
in
ohio.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
only
grant.
unknown
speaker
for
the
double
jeopardy
point,
same
sovereign.
unknown
speaker
i
wonder
what
you
do
at
county
like
texa
county
where
the
state
line
run
down
in
the
middle
of
the
street.
unknown
speaker
i
think
your
basic
argument
and
i
have
trouble
with
it
is
if
they
knew
that
he
was
guilty
of
the
major
crime
--
unknown
speaker
they
knew?
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
what?
unknown
speaker
all
these
10
days,
is
there
any
case
in
ohio
--
the
difference
between
the
two
statutes
is
the
number
of
days?
unknown
speaker
there
was
one
additional
point
that
had
to
be
shown.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
mr.
plautz,
the
prosecutions
were
in
different
counties,
weren’t
they?
unknown
speaker
say
that
again
once.
unknown
speaker
you
said
he
receives
six
months
on
a
second
go-around?
unknown
speaker
you
did
not
mention
that
was
suspending.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
think
that
more
serious
crime
ended
up
in
a
suspended
sentence?
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
think
the
second
one
was
as
more
lenient
because
of
the
service
of
that
first
sentence
at
all?
unknown
speaker
does
this
record
show
whether
that
was
part
of
your
plea
agreement,
you’d
have
a
rather
comprehensive
agreement
on
the
second
charge,
was
there
an
agreement
that
the
sentence
would
be
suspended?
unknown
speaker
then
the
follow-through
worries
lake
county,
ohio?
unknown
speaker
east
or
west?
unknown
speaker
ashtabula?
unknown
speaker
west
of
ashtabula,
that
is
not
very
far.
unknown
speaker
the
first
prosecution
of
ohio
was
in
a
municipal
court?
unknown
speaker
now,
he
is
claimant?
unknown
speaker
how
was
that
jurisdiction
--
that
was
in
another
county?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sadd,
of
course,
the
complaint
and
summons
that
was
filed
on
the
joyriding
charge
does
identify
the
name
and
address
of
the
owner
of
the
vehicle
as
being
in
east
cleveland,
but
there
was
knowledge
where
that
vehicle
had
been
taken
from
i
suppose,
no
reasonable
inference?
unknown
speaker
but
his
complaint
says
the
owner
was
gloria
ingram,
gives
her
address
and…
unknown
speaker
but
the
point
is
not
critical
whether
they
talk
to
the
law
enforcement
officers
is
that
is
not
point
that’s
critical
is
that
they
had
a
reasonable
basis
for
finding
out
where
the
theft
took
place.
unknown
speaker
but
the
fact
is
in
the
record,
they
knew
where
the
car
came
from,
they
knew
the
name
of
the
owner
either
pick
up
the
phone
they
found
that
where
was
stolen,
didn’t
they.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
is
consistent
with
the
state
court’s
holding?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
court
said
they
were
under
ohio
law
that
was
a
lesser
included
offense?
unknown
speaker
are
we
bound
by
that
as
a
construction
of
ohio
law?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
though
that
in
finding
the
joyriding
to
be
a
lesser
included
offense,
the
ohio
court
said
that
every
single
element
necessary
to
prove
that
offense
was
also
necessary
to
prove
the
greater
offense.
unknown
speaker
is
it
what
they
said?
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
that
at
least
to
that
extent,
we
are
bound
by
the
court’s
ruling
about
ohio
law
that
there
was
no
element
necessary
to
prove
the
lesser
included
offense
that
was
not
necessary
to
prove
the
greater
offense.
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
supporting
part
of
that
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
are
you
supporting
that
positively
dispositive
part
of
their
opinion?
unknown
speaker
that
they
were
just
completely
different
offences?
unknown
speaker
would
you
start
to
tell
us,
mr.
sadd,
about
a
decision
in
the
ohio
court
system,
the
ohio
supreme
court
subsequent
to
this
one?
unknown
speaker
but
they
did
deal
with
the
different
statute?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
isn’t
that
really,
maybe
with
some
constitutional
limitations,
but
isn’t
that
really,
in
the
first
instance
at
least
the
function
of
the
courts
of
ohio
to
determine
whether
or
not
something
is
lesser
into
the
defense
and
something
else.
unknown
speaker
well
there
always
is,
that’s
the
definition
of
the
lesser
included
offence.
unknown
speaker
if
the
greater
offence
requires
the
same
element
as
the
lesser
offence
plus
something
else.
unknown
speaker
right
and
that’s
the
constitutional
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don’t
understand
why
you
don’t,
whether
you
don’t
defend
the
argument
rationale
of
the
ohio
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
maybe
that
is
not
acceptable
for
constitutional
purposes.
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
they
held
and
that
what
they…
unknown
speaker
even
though,
it
was
a
lesser
included
offence
in
the
sense
that
if
somebody
were
charged
with
larceny
of
an
automobile
and
were
convicted
of
joyriding.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sadd,
under
the
reasoning
of
the
ohio
court
of
appeals,
do
you
think
if
they
had
--
instead
of
having
one
prosecution
for
joyriding
and
then
the
second
one
for
stealing
on
a
different
date,
if
the
second
prosecution
had
also
been
for
joyriding
on
a
different
date,
what
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
of
ohio
would
have
done
in
this?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
don’t
rely
no
the
dates
difference
then?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don’t
think
the
court
of
appeals
rely
on
the
date
difference?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
saying
that
reliant
is
misplaced.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
but
assuming
they
both
have
been
violation
to
subsection
(d),
what
i
am
trying
to
both
joyriding
charges
but
involving
different
dates.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
we
would
have
an
obligation
to
affirm
that
decision?
unknown
speaker
because
of
difference
in
dates?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
have
two
entirely
separate
arguments.
unknown
speaker
accepted
dates
only
apply
to
one
crime
but
not
to
the
other
one.
unknown
speaker
you
couldn’t
charge
him
with
the
stealing
it
ten
different
days,
couldn’t
you?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
say
finally
to
this
date
position?
unknown
speaker
mr.
plautz,
you
used
the
word
‘inherently
arbitrary’
a
moment
ago.
