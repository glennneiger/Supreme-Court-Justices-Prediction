mr.
robert
plautz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
robert
plautz,
i
am
counsel
for
petitioner.
this
case
concerns
the
assertion
by
the
state
of
ohio
that
it
can
try
twice,
convict
twice
and
punish
twice,
one
man
for
the
theft
of
one
1967
chevrolet.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
the
petitioner
nathaniel
brown
was
arrested
and
in
addition
to
being
charged
of
certain
traffic
offenses,
a
complaint
that
were
filed
against
him
charged
that
he
did
unlawfully
and
purposely
take
drive
for
operate
a
certain
motor
vehicle
without
the
consent
of
the
owner
of
that
motor
vehicle.
mr.
robert
plautz
no,
it
does
not
your
honor.
mr.
robert
plautz
it
requires
the
proof
of
intent
to
permanently
deprive
the
owner
of
possession.
the
complaint
that
was
filed
against
him
in
the
first
charge
listed
the
name
of
the
owner
of
the
automobile
and
it
listed
her
address.
two
days
later,
petitioner
answered
that
charge.
he
waived
counsel,
he
waived
trial
by
jury
and
without
any
plea
negotiations
being
entered
into,
he
pled
guilty
to
all
of
the
charges
that
were
lodged
against
him.
he
was
sentenced
to
30
days
in
the
workhouse
fined
$100
in
court
cost.
30
days
later
as
petitioner
was
leaving
the
workhouse,
waiting
for
him
at
the
gates
of
the
workhouse
were
police
officers.
these
are
officers
arrested
petitioner
and
charged
him
with
stealing
the
same
motor
vehicle
that
had
been
the
subject
to
the
first
charge.
this
time
this
complaint
that
was
filed
against
him
though,
alleged
the
date
of
the
offense
to
be
ten
days
prior
to
the
date
that
was
alleged
in
the
first
complaint.
after
certain
procedural
matters,
petitioner
conditionally
pled
guilty
to
the
charge,
but
he
expressed
understanding
that
a
subsequent
motion
to
withdraw
the
plaintiff’s
misindictment
on
the
grounds
of
double
jeopardy
could
be
filed.
the
state
agreed
to
this
procedure.
the
motion
was
filed,
hearing
was
had
and
motion
was
denied.
petitioner
then
was
sentenced
to
six
months
in
the
county
jail;
sentence
was
suspended
and
placed
on
one
year
probation.
petitioner
appealed
his
conviction
to
the
ohio
court
of
appeals,
eighth
appellate
district.
that
court
affirmed
to
conviction
holding
that
the
two
charges
were
the
same
offense
within
the
meaning
of
double
jeopardy
clause
applying
this
court’s
test
in
blockburger
and
it
says
they
were
the
same
offense,
however
because
different
dates
were
alleged
and
the
complaints
supposedly
different
crimes
were
committed.
mr.
robert
plautz
there
would
have
been
nothing
wrong
with
that.
they
could
constitutionally
charge
a
person
there
with
multiple
counts,
if
they
provided
to
give
the
person
adequate
notice
of
this
offense.
i
would
cite
examples
of
those
types
of
crimes.
they
are
more
not
really
crimes
of
common
law
that
emitting
noxious
odors
each
day…
mr.
robert
plautz
right,
but
they’re
also
are
--
each
day
you
operate
a
gambling
house
or
some
body
house
of
some
sort
whatever
the
statute
say.
those
statutes
give
the
accuse
adequate
notice
that
each
day
he
does
it
he
is
going
to
get
nailed
for
his
misdeeds.
also
in
those
instances,
there
are
valid
interests
that
the
state
has
been
protecting
an
individual
--
protecting
society
from
that
type
of
offense.
now,
admittedly
i
am
sure
gloria
ingram
did
not
feel
any
better
by
having
her
car
--
gloria
ingram
was
a
victim
by
having
a
car
and
missing
ten
days
as
opposed
to
only
a
few
hours.
mr.
robert
plautz
yes,
i
think
you
would
have
to
look
at
the
arbitrary
and
what
the
state
does,
what
it
statutes
when
they
are
applying
to
the
accused.
well,
in
a
theft
case,
i
was
going
to
getting
into
that
later.
in
a
theft
case,
such
as
this
just
because
it
was
alleged
different
dates
in
the
complaint,
does
not
make
it
two
different
crimes.
they
could
conceivably
under
the
ohio
court
of
appeals’
opinion
have
alleged
file
ten
complaints
against
him
alleging
different
dates
and
it
would
have
been
just
arbitrariness
on
top
of
it
and
i
would
think
this
court’s
opinion
in
in
re
snow.
mr.
robert
plautz
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
plautz
not,
greater
wrong
i
mean
i
am
being
wrong…
mr.
robert
plautz
yes,
the
state
of
ohio
has
provided
that
each
day,
i
am
more
aggrieved
as
far
as
your
criminal
statutes
are
concerned,
they
feel
that,
you
do
it
once,
you
did
it.
mr.
robert
plautz
oh,
yes.
i
would
make
that
argument
if
that
would
this
case.
mr.
robert
plautz
those
are
not
the
facts
in
this
case,
but
i
would
think
that
he
could
if
the
second
statute…
mr.
robert
plautz
it
may
not,
immediately
your
honor.
mr.
robert
plautz
it
sometimes
called
joyriding
and
it
does
not...
mr.
robert
plautz
your
honor
that
statute
does
not
require
intent
to
permanent
deprive
the
owner
of
possession,
admittedly
there
are
close
cases,
but
under
that
statute,
a
person
could
have
the
car
for
as
long
as
a
year
and
as
long
as
he
does
not
form
the
intent,
all
the
elements
on
that
statute
are
not
proved.
now
obviously,
there
does
come
a
time
when
the
person
has
a
car
for
such
a
long
time
as
a
matter
of
law
it
is
steal,
it
is
a
not
a
joyride.
mr.
robert
plautz
they
could,
but
i
am
sure
if
we
would
on
to
trial
they
would
introduce
the
confession
that
they
did
obtain
from
them
within
two
hours
after
the
rest
and
in
that
confession,
he
states
that
he
did
not
have
the
intent
to
permanently
deprive
the
owner
possession.
he
was
just
going
to
take
the
car
until
he
found
a
job.
now
obviously
the
jury
is
going
to
buy
that
or
another
issue,
they
could
very
well
at
though.
the
ohio
supreme
court
denied
further
state
appellate
review
in
this
case.
now,
there
are
three
important
facts
to
note
in
this
case
and
first
as
we
have
gone
into
is
at
the
same
automobile
involved
in
all
the
charges.
secondly,
petitioner
had
no
notice
of
that
second
charge
at
the
time
of
his
un-counseled
plea
under
first
charge.
similarly,
petitioner
was
given
an
opportunity
to
defend
himself
on
that
second
charge
until
after
the
expiration
of
his
first
charge.
finally,
another
important
fact
to
note
is
that
the
second
charge
is
alleged
to
have
occurred
prior
to
the
first
charge.
mr.
robert
plautz
your
honor
the
issue
that
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case
was
not
raised
at
all
in
the
two
trial
courts?
mr.
robert
plautz
yes.
mr.
robert
plautz
oh,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
plautz
on
double
jeopardy
grounds…
mr.
robert
plautz
no,
your
honor.
the
reason
was
that
in
the
two
trial
courts,
we
had
really
two
trial
courts
even
in
this
same
one.
the
east
cleveland
municipal
court
and
the
cuyahoga
county
common
pleas
court
both
of
those
judges
were
concerning
whether
or
not
they
are
lesser
included
offenses.
as
far
as
they
were
concerned,
if
they
were
lesser
included
offenses,
the
indictment
had
to
be
dismissed.
all
the
papers
and
motions
and
arguments
in
the
trial
courts
were
focused
on
whether
they
were
lesser
included
offenses.
it
made
no
difference
about
the
dates
and
the
complaints.
we
took
the
case
up
to
the
ohio
court
of
appeals.
you
are
looking
at
the
brief
in
that
case.
all
the
arguments
were
addressed
to
lesser
included
offenses
and
that
is
why
the
ohio
court
of
appeal
spent
so
much
time
in
their
decision
stating
that
it
was
a
lesser
included
offense.
then
all
of
a
sudden,
they
came
out
with
this
decision
that
it
was
because
of
the
dates
in
offend.
i
then
filed
a
motion
to
reconsideration,
timely
filed
in
that
case,
which
i
am
allowed.
i
filed
a
timely
motioned
the
reconsideration
stating
as
a
continuous
offense.
that
is
why
we
have
a
different
issue
here
today
and
we
do
not
have
the
issue
of
lesser
included
offense
because
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
explicitly
held
that
it
was
a
lesser
included
offense.
now,
in
this
case
we
are
dealing
with
a
state
statute…
mr.
robert
plautz
that
is
the
color
they
put
on
it,
the
act
--
mr.
robert
plautz
statutorily
constructed,
it
is
a
same
offense,
but
as
the
action
in
the
complaint,
no
it
is
not,
supposedly
two
different
crimes
committed.
mr.
robert
plautz
you
are
correct
your
honor.
now,
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
interpret
that
statute.
we
are
asking
this
court
rather
to
look
to
the
statutory
interpretation
of
that
statute
given
to
it
by
the
ohio
courts.
look
to
the
conduct
that
is
prohibited
by
that
statute,
look
to
the
conduct
of
the
accuse
in
this
case
nathaniel
brown
and
then
judge
whether
the
actions
by
the
state
of
ohio
violate
the
purposes
and
policies
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
now,
that
statute
under
which
he
was
convicted,
prohibits
taking,
operating
or
keeping
a
car
without
the
owner’s
consent.
the
complaint
filed
against
him
charged
taking,
driving
or
operating
now
apparently
the
person
who
drew
the
complain
copy
the
wrong
form
because
the
statute
had
been
amended
in
march
of
1972.
but
anyway
it
has
never
been
alleged,
it
is
nothing
but
the
statute
in
effect
at
the
time
of
arrest
that
he
was
charged
with.
and
that
statute
covers
all
types
of
means
and
methods
in
which
one
person
can
deprive
another
person
of
dominion
control
and
possession
of
the
property.
it
covers
all
types
of
situations
in
which
that
can
occur.
now,
once
a
state
prosecuted
and
convicted
for
that
conduct
for
operating,
taking
and
keeping
that
car
without
the
owner’s
consent,
it
was
bar
from
thereafter
prosecuting
petitioner
again
for
taking
and
operating
the
same
motor
vehicle
when
there
has
been
no
interruption
in
his
conduct.
mr.
robert
plautz
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
plautz
they
are
the
same
offense
in
that…
mr.
robert
plautz
no,
your
honor.
well,
that
has
something
to
do
with
the
evidence
are
being
introduced,
but
once
the
attached
prosecution
to
his
conduct
of
taking,
keeping
and
operating
the
car
for
as
long
as
he
was
taking,
keeping
and
operating
that
car,
once
he
attached
that,
they
gotten
for
that
entire
conduct.
applying
them
to
same
evidence
test
of
this
court…
mr.
robert
plautz
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
plautz
once
they
got
them
for
the
conduct,
they
got
them
for
the
conduct
as
long
as
it
last,
applying
them
to
same
evidence
test
to
the
events
of
november
29th
1973.
at
the
very
moment,
he
may
have
had
that
intent
to
permanently
deprive
the
owner
possession,
he
was
also
taking
the
car,
operating
the
car
and
keeping
the
car.
he
was
also
doing
that
on
november
29th.
mr.
robert
plautz
that
he
did
not
have
the
intent?
mr.
robert
plautz
yes,
they
would
have
had
that
obligation.
mr.
robert
plautz
when
–
and
plea
negotiation
thing
entered
into,
i
saw
that
a
jury
could
have
concluded
that
this
was
an
auto
stealing
and
i
made
that
decision
and
i
advised
the
client,
he
agreed,
we
pled
guilty
to
auto
stealing
and
there
was
a
confession
obtained
from
the
individual
within
two
hours
after
his
arrest
by
the
second
prosecuting
authorities
and
that
confession
was
made
available
to
me
and
then
it
was
available
in
front
of
all
of
the
courts’
fellows.
now,
this
court
need
not
expand
any
other
--
make
any
new
doctrine
of
constitutional
law
in
this
case.
it
has
a
test,
it
has
the
same
evidence
test
and
just
as
this
court
added
some
refinements
in
it,
say
in
the
waller
case
when
baring
multiple
prosecution
from
municipalities,
unless
we
find
a
test
again
and
say
that
it
also
applies
to
continuous
offenses
which
by
their
nature.
now,
theoretically
under
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
decision,
even
if
it
was
that
one
prosecution,
a
victim
of
a
crime
such
in
a
theft
offense
could
get
on
a
stand
and
the
prosecutor
could
ask
during
direct
testimony,
glory
ingram...
could
you
give
permission
for
the
defendant
to
have
the
car
on
december
8th?
no.
could
you
give
permission
for
the
defendant
to
have
the
car
on
december
7th?
december
6th?
8th,
5th?
all
the
way
down
to
november
29.
technically
speaking
that
is
different
evidence,
but
on
cross
examination
by
simply
asking
the
witness,
did
you
ever
have
possession
of
the
car
at
all
during
that
period
of
time?
i
think
the
evidence
then,
the
complexion
of
that
evidence
substantially
changes
and
inherently
is
the
same
evidence
that
he
is
defending
against
himself
again
and
the
state
need
not
even
bother
with
the
dates
of
the
offense,
by
changing
dates
of
the
offense.
they
could
do
it
for
every
hour
or
every
week
or
whatever
the
crime
is,
they
see
to
fit
do
and
to
conclusion
of
larceny
prosecution,
all
they
need
to
do
is
take
the
accusatory
instrument,
cross
out
the
date
of
defense,
put
it
into
the
typewriter,
type
up
a
new
date
and
they
have
new
crime
and
type
on
to
get
a
new
trial
and
new
punishment
which
is
happened
in
this
case.
now,
in
the
previous
case
that
was
argued,
there
were
some
questions
about
double
punishment
that
is
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case.
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
from
the
sentence
that
was
imposed
during
this
at
the
second
trial.
that
it
was
in
anyway
curative
of
the
first
sentence
imposed.
first
time
around
he
got
30
days
in
the
workhouse,
second
time
around
he
got
six
months
in
the
county
jail,
sentence
suspended
placed
on
one
year
probation.
mr.
robert
plautz
that
it
is
not
entire
true
your
honor.
mr.
robert
plautz
that
it
is
not
my
argument
your
honor.
there
are
limited
situations
where
the
greater
offense
could
be
subsequently
charged
such
as
united
states
v.
diaz.
this
is
not
united
states
v.
diaz
because
here
that
greater
charge
alleged
to
have
occurred
prior
to
the
lesser
charge
ten
days
before
and
the
state
had
adequate
notice
that
had
occurred.
this
is
not
something
where
an
element
of
a
crime
occurred
after.
mr.
robert
plautz
as
a
general
rule,
yes,
but
there
are
exceptions
which
i
just
mentioned
the
united
states
v.
diaz.
mr.
robert
plautz
yes
i
am,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
plautz
well,
that
would
be
true
but
if
this
court
finds
that
they
could
have
prosecuted
for
the
greater
offense.
he
still
was
subject
to
the
double
punishment
then.
it’s
unclear
whether
from
some
of
the
court’s
opinions,
it
seems
that
he
would
have
more
of
a
due
process
argument
than
a
double
jeopardy
argument.
he
still
nonetheless
makes
the
argument
that
he
was
subject
to
a
second
punishment,
the
second
time
around.
mr.
robert
plautz
yes,
your
honor.
but
if
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
interpretation
of
the
statute
as
discussed
by
you
and
your
colloquy
with
justice
white
is
upheld
and
these
are
in
fact
two
different
offenses,
then
not
only
can
he
be
prosecuted
twice
for
that
and
he
can
be
punished
twice.
mr.
robert
plautz
oh,
for
sure,
yes.
mr.
robert
plautz
yeah,
he
would
be
charged
under
the
california
statute
for
joyriding
under
their
statute.
mr.
robert
plautz
same
sovereign,
ohio
court
of
appeals
made
that
explicitly
clear
citing
waller
v.
florida.
mr.
robert
plautz
only
grant
for
what,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
plautz
well,
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
didn’t
even
consider
that.
mr.
robert
plautz
well,
i
think
the
court
in
one
of
the
cases
we
are
going
to
do
featherweight
constitutional
rights
on
such
metaphysical
--
mr.
robert
plautz
they
had
enough
proof
--
if
they
want
and
they
had
enough
proof
within
two
hours
after
his
arrest.
mr.
robert
plautz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
plautz
he
signed
a
full
confession
saying
i
took
the
car
on
november
29.
mr.
robert
plautz
not
involved
in
this
case
but
there
is
another
subsection
in
this
statute,
subsection
(b)
of
this
statute
that
does
provide
for
48
hours.
mr.
robert
plautz
in
the
second
prosecution?
mr.
robert
plautz
yes,
your
honor,
intent
to
permanently
deprive
the
owner
possession.
mr.
robert
plautz
yes
and
as
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
made
it
clear,
it
didn’t
matter.
mr.
robert
plautz
as
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
made
clear
it
didn’t
matter
in
their
decision
at
all
as
the
same
sovereign.
mr.
robert
plautz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
plautz
i
thought
i
did,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
robert
plautz
i
think
that
it
was
more
serious
because
the
first
prosecution
occurred
in
a
more
rural
county
where
they
come
down
harder
on
offenses
like
that
and
the
second
prosecution
happened
in
urban
cleveland.
mr.
robert
plautz
no,
i
know
i
can
make
a
representation
for
that
that
you
just
denied
the
motion
and
it
did
not
make
any
difference.
mr.
robert
plautz
no,
that
wasn’t
discussed
at
all.
mr.
robert
plautz
it
is
contiguous
to
cuyahoga
county
in
certain
places.
mr.
robert
plautz
it
is
east
of
cuyahoga
county
from
where
he
was
first
apprehended
with
the
car
to
from
where
he
first
took
the
car,
about
a
45-minute
drive.
mr.
robert
plautz
it’s
west
of
ashtabula.
mr.
robert
plautz
i
think
there
is
so
you
can
make
some
indication
of
that.
mr.
robert
plautz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
plautz
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
plautz
there
was
a
specific
ohio
statute
that
says
that
any
person
--
well
there
are
two
statutes
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
dealing
with
all
theft
offenses
and
other
dealing
specifically
with
motor
vehicle
saying
that
when
you
take
the
car
and
you
go
into
another
county,
you
can
be
tried,
prosecuted
in
any
county
in
which
you
took
the
car
and
that
statute
specifically
says
prosecution
on
acquittal
in
one
county
bars
prosecution
in
another
county.
mr.
robert
plautz
few
minutes.
mr.
robert
plautz
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
plautz
i
think
it’s
inherently
arbitrary
to
have
a
statute
that
prohibits
conduct,
try,
prosecute,
convict,
punish
that
individual
for
that
conduct,
then
come
around
and
try
to
punish
him
again
for
that
same
conduct.
mr.
robert
plautz
yes,
i
would
answer
to
your
question
but
to
explain.
