mr.
george
j.
sadd
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
yes,
i
object
to
any
material
and
matter
that
is
not
contained
in
the
record
before
this
court.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
i
thought
you
said
something
different,
i
am
sorry,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
not
necessarily,
mr.
justice.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
that
information
could
have
been
obtained
by
simply
calling
the
bureau
of
motor
vehicles
of
the
state
of
ohio
and
obtaining
the
owner
of
that
vehicle
and
the
residence
of
that
owner,
as
necessarily
mean
that
there
was
any
reason
for
the
lake
county
officials
to
contact
the
individual
law
enforcement
officers
in
cuyahoga
county.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
yes,
but
it’s
not
in
the
record.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
i
think
you
could
take
a
very
limited
judicial
notice
of
that
fact
that
there
wasn’t,
but
you
can’t
take
any
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
on
the
record
as
it
is
presented
that
there
was
any
communication
between
lake
county
and
cuyahoga
county.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
we
have
it,
if
a
vehicle
is
stolen
that
it
would
be
reported
and
placed
to
that
and
32.09
to
all
law
enforcement
agencies.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
i
have
no
idea,
i
am
not
from
lake
county,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
yes
it
is.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
not
really.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
no.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
that’s
correct.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
it’s
correct.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
this
court
for
purposes
of
double
jeopardy
can
constitutionalize
in
question
of
ohio
law
or
remand
this
decision
to
the
ohio
supreme
court
for
certification
of
whether
or
not
operating
a
motor
vehicle
is
a
lesser
included
offense
of
auto
stealing.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
that’s
correct,
i
feel…
mr.
george
j.
sadd
yes.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
yes,
they
are
completely
different
offences
on
their
face
and
auto
stealing
requires
an
attempt
to
permanently
deprive
an
owner
of
its
possession
permanently
and
requires
a
physical
taking
of
vehicle,
whereas
operating
a
stolen
motor
vehicle
without
the
owner’s
consent
is
joyriding
and…
mr.
george
j.
sadd
yes.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
was
ohio
v.
36.02.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
they
held
and
construed
a
decision,
a
similar
statute
section
49,
45.04.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
yes
i
do,
it’s
included
in
my
brief,
it
is
--
mr.
george
j.
sadd
no
it
was
present.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
but
dealt
with
a
larceny
statute
of
concealing
a
stolen
motor
vehicle
and
here
we
have
a
larceny
statute
of
auto
stealing
and
to
support
my
position
that
the
two
offences
are
totally
separate,
we
say
that
auto
stealing
requires
an
intent
to
permanently
deprive
the
owner
of
his
possession
permanently
and
requires
a
physical
taking,
whereas
operating
a
stolen
motor
vehicle
is
joyriding
or
temporary
taking
and
not
larceny,
and
to
support
that,
in
my
supplemental
brief,
i
would
like
to
count
on
the
traditional
purpose
of
the
joyriding
statute.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
it
is
correct.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
no,
i
still
say
mr.
justice
stewart
that
you
can
constitutionalize
--
mr.
george
j.
sadd
then
i
would
urge
that,
this
case
maybe
appropriate
for
a
remand
for
the
ohio
supreme
court
determine
that
issue,
however…
mr.
george
j.
sadd
mr.
justice
stewart,
this
court
feels,
that
if
bound
by
the
decision
of
the
ohio
court
of
appeals,
then
we
would
urge
upon
this
court
that
prosecution
for
a
lesser
offence,
a
lesser
included
offence
and
the
first
instance
does
not
bar
prosecution
for
the
greater
offence
because
in
that
particular
instance,
there
is
an
additional
element
contained
in
the
felony
statute.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
and
we
have
urged
them
for
purposes
of
double
jeopardy
that
the
man
has
never
been
placed
in
jeopardy
on
the
additional
offence.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
because
this
fifth
amendment
speaks
in
terms
of
no
person
shall
be
placed
in
jeopardy
twice
for
the
same
offence.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
but
then
the
decision
of
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
could
be
upheld
on
the
basis
that
they
did
constitute
two
different
operative
acts
occurring
nine
days
apart.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
that’s
correct.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
i
think
they
perhaps
--
they
might
have
felt
that
it
might
have
been
the
same
offence,
but
i
am
not
causing…
mr.
george
j.
sadd
i
rely
on
the
date
difference.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
they
did
rely
on
the
date
difference;
they
said
it
occurred
nine
days
differently.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
of
this
case?
mr.
george
j.
sadd
i
wonder
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
i
would
say
that
prosecution
for
a
lesser
offence
would
not
bar
prosecution
for
greater
offence,
because
they
were
based….
mr.
george
j.
sadd
i
would
still
say
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
affirmed
the
decision
saying
that
that
occurred
in
different
counties.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
yes.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
it’s
correct.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
that’s
correct.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
that’s
correct.
mr.
george
j.
sadd
no,
that’s
not
presented
for
this
court.
