the
respondent,
sylvania
incorporated,
manufactures
and
sells
television
sets.
in
an
effort
to
increase
its
declining
sales,
sylvania
adopted
a
franchise
plan
to
sell
directly
to
a
more
select
group
of
franchise
with
retailers.
it
limited
the
number
of
franchise.
franchise
is
granted
to
any
given
area
and
required
each
franchisee
to
sell
its
sylvania
products
only
from
locations
at
which
it
was
franchised.
a
dispute
arose
between
sylvania
and
one
of
the
holders
of
the
franchise,
continental
t.v.
in
the
litigation
that
followed,
continental
contended
that
sylvania
had
violated
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
by
prohibiting
the
sale
of
sylvania's
tvs
from
other
than
specified
locations.
in
a
case
--
in
case
that
was
here
in
1967,
united
states
against
schwinn,
this
court
annunciated
a
per
se
rule
of
liability
when
manufacturers
imposed
certain
vertical
restrictions
on
wholesalers
and
retailers
of
its
products.
the
district
court
in
this
case
thought
that
the
schwinn
per
se
rule
was
applicable
and
instructed
the
jury
accordingly,
a
large
verdict
was
rendered
against
sylvania.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
finding
a
basis
for
the
distinguishing
the
schwinn
rule.
although,
we
think
no
adequate
basis
for
a
distinction
exists,
we
have
reexamined
the
decision
in
schwinn
and
conclude
today
that
it
should
be
overruled.
the
per
se
rule
of
illegality
adopted
for
the
first
time
in
that
case
was
a
departure
from
antitrust
principles
generally
applicable.
restrictions
similar
to
those
used
by
sylvania
are
widely
employed
in
our
free
market
economy.
the
weight
of
scholarly
and
judicial
authority
supports
their
economic
usefulness.
accordingly,
we
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
we
do
so
on
different
grounds.
mr.
justice
white
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
result.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
marshall
has
joined.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
