mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
is
in
a
common
place
of
course
in
the
--
as
a
backdrop
to
this
case
that
congress
need
not
allow
the
admission
of
any
aliens
much
less
need
congress
grant
immigration
preference
to
any
aliens.
the
core
of
this
case
of
course
has
to
do
with
the
latter
that
is
with
preferences
which
congress
attempted
to
achieve
by
classifications
adopted
first
in
1952
and
most
importantly
for
this
case
of
1957
and
section
101
(b)
(1)
and
(2).
very
briefly,
the
government
complains
that
these
are
classifications
which
congress
has
the
primary
jurisdiction
to
adopt.
they
are
rational
and
they
are
related
to
illegitimate
immigration
purpose
unless
they
do
not
offend
the
due
process
clause.
preliminarily,
i
might
say
that
there
is
certain
things
which
the
government
contends
are
really
not
involved
in
this
case
though
one
might
assume
so
if
you
were
to
listen
to
some
of
our
arguments.
i
think
as
the
plaintiffs
concede,
although
i
am
not
certain,
but
i
think
ms.
calvo
said
this,
this
is
not
a
case
where
illegitimacy
standing
along
or
fathering
an
illegitimate
son
or
daughter
standing
alone
works
in
exclusion
or
a
bar
under
the
statute.
nor
as
to
the
case
where
classification
is
simply
a
routine
distinction
or
a
simplistic
distinction,
if
you
will,
between
man
and
the
one
hand
and
females
on
the
other
hand,
and
finally,
i
might
note
this
is
not
a
case
as
plaintiffs
parent
still
argue
where
the
preference
provisions
were
designed
to
unify
all
families.
we
contend
rather
that
the
apparent
intent
of
congress
if
you
just
look
at
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
was
to
reunify
families
to
the
extent
rationally
feasible
where
there
have
been
separations
particularly
caused
by
our
immigration
laws
or
some
of
them
and
especially
where
those
separations
were
most
likely
to
cause
unusual
hardship.
in
short,
we
urge
that
congress
act
did
not
haphazardly
but
discreetly
and
with
care.
for
example,
as
this
already
been
brought
out,
congress
decided
that
children
legitimate
or
otherwise
over
21
or
married
get
no
preference
at
all.
congress
similarly
decided
that
children
who
have
been
legitimate
after
they
are
18
years
of
age
get
no
preference.
similarly,
congress
decided
that
children
adopted
after
they
are
14
years
of
age
get
no
preference.
they
decided
that
stepchildren
made
such
by
a
marriage
after
they
are
18
get
no
preference
for
admission
to
these
shores.
and
of
course
for
this
case,
as
the
court
well
knows
preferences
by
virtue
of
the
definition
of
parent
and
child
go
only
to
the
mother
and
her
illegitimate
child
and
not
to
the
father.
now,
obviously
i
assume
once
we
look
at
it
with
reasonable
care
we
have
to
accept
that
if
nothing
else
is
clear
a
mother
has
once
been
re
--
has
once
been
united
with
her
child.
but,
surely,
congress
had
in
mind
that
fathers
necessarily
never
were
united.
and
i
think
this
is
a
legitimate
concern
particularly
where
you
are
dealing
with
a
father
who
has
never
chosen
to
legitimate
his
child
prior
to
some
point
where
an
attempt
can
be
made
to
petition
for
entry.
now,
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it
as
the
plaintiffs
argue
and
as
the
court
knows
what
congress
did
here
was
setup
a
presumption
but
we
urge
that
it
is
a
presumption
based
upon
a
rational
empirical
judgment
or
classification.
furthermore,
we
urge
that
congress
quite
obviously
made
this
judgment
or
cut
on
the
basis
of
difficulties
approved
for
paternity.
and
there
is
no
lawyer
where
the
smidgen
of
experience
who
doesn’t
know
what
the
difficulties
are
proof
of
paternity
i
assume,
and
of
course
the
likelihood
of
spurious
claims
as
ms.
calvo
has
pointed
out.
now,
we
do
not
urge
here
that
just
because
this
is
an
immigration
case
or
it’s
a
case
arising
under
the
ina
that
this
court
has
no
right
to
look
at
the
case,
of
course
it
does.
what
we
do
urge
is
that
the
plaintiffs
have
the
burden
of
proof
of
showing
that
the
classification
or
cut
by
congress
in
deciding
who
was
to
be
preferred
and
who
is
not
to
be
preferred
by
defining
children
and
parents
that
this
classification
or
cut
is
irrational.
they
fail
in
this
burden
we
submit
for
several
reasons.
first,
as
it
has
been
pointed
out
to
you
early
and
often
this
afternoon
alone
by
others
in
the
illinois
case,
illegitimacy
has
never
been
held
squarely
by
this
court
to
be
what
is
called
a
suspect
classification,
for
this
reason
and
because
we
are
concerned
with
the
admission
of
aliens,
a
matter
obviously
or
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
legislature,
strict
judicial
scrutiny
is
neither
necessary
nor
appropriate.
as
the
court
has
held
recently
in
domestic
cases,
drawing
of
lines
is
peculiarly
a
legislative
task
and
it’s
a
task
where
perfection
is
neither
possible
nor
necessary.
now
this
is
the
rule
of
course
that
has
been
annunciated
for
cases
involving
citizens
who
have
the
full
panoply
of
constitutional
protection.
a
fortiori,
we
would
urge
it
is
probably
the
outermost
limit
that
one
could
reasonably
ask
for
an
alien
who
is
seeking
preference
for
admission
to
our
country.
let
me
conclude
if
i
may
with
two
points.
as
if
almost
to
recognize
their
difficulties
in
the
main
issues,
plaintiff
seem
to
resort
to
the
claim
that
the
parent
and
child
definitions
herein
issue
somehow
invidiously
impact
upon
the
constitutional
right
of
a
citizen.
apparently,
that
is
a
right
which
i
guess
they
call
as
i
read
their
brief,
a
right
to
a
unified
family.
well,
i
have
two
arguments
to
raise
against
that
if
the
court
please.
first
of
all,
i
am
not
sure
that
this
is
a
right
which
has
been
recognized
in
the
constitution
and
perhaps
in
a
more
specialized
argument.
it
seems
to
me
that
one
reason
we
urge
upon
the
court
consideration
of
the
fairly
recent
case
kleindienst
versus
mandel
which
to
be
sure
involved
first
amendment
rights
of
a
citizen
and
an
alien’s
context
to
and
extent
simply
because
professor
mandel,
as
you
remember,
was
seeking
to
be
admitted
to
speak
here
and
to
converse
with
academic
people
and
other
who
wanted
to
hear
him.
and
there
as
i
understand
this
court
it
recognized
that
if
the
constitutional
rights
of
citizens
were
to
prevail
in
cases
which
involve
the
decision
by
the
legislature
or
the
executive
under
delegation
by
the
legislature
to
exclude
or
keep
out
aliens,
then
the
congressional
power
to
determine
such
exclusion
which
we
all
i
think
concede
exist
would
really
work
out
to
be
a
note.
and
finally,
if
it
may
please
the
court,
i
notice
that
an
oral
argument
as
in
their
brief
plaintiffs,
once
again
contend
that
somehow
this
case
presents
no
foreign
policy
issues
or
choices.
in
other
words,
in
1957
as
i
understand
the
argument,
congress
didn’t
sit
down
and
then
someway
either
in
the
actual
statutory
language
or
in
some
thing
that
we
all
are
trained
to
call
legislative
history,
utterances
that
this
is
a
great
matter
of
foreign
policy
or
some
foreign
policy
choices.
i
thought
that
argument
had
been
put
to
rest
by
mr.
justice
jackson
24
years
ago
in
harisiades
when
he
pointed
out
that
when
congress
makes
these
cuts
and
when
congress
determines
who
is
excluded
and
who
is
admitted
and
then
the
reasons
why
that
that
kind
of
a
cut
or
that
kind
of
classification
by
necessity
goes
to
the
heart
of
our
relation
with
other
governments.
this
is
a
good
illustration
as
ms.
calvo
has
properly
stated.
one
of
the
problems
here
is
that
a
good
deal
depends
upon
the
laws
of
other
jurisdictions
who
gets
admitted
under
the
statute
or
other
sections
of
the
immigration
and
national
act.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
oh!
yes,
we
have.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
well,
the
difficulty
is
as
i
said
earlier.
congress
apparently
was
relying
on
two
propositions
which
even
the
plaintiffs
sociological
and
statistical
studies
which
they
mention
in
their
briefs
don’t
really
dispose
of
this,
i
see
it.
first
of
all
even
the
studies
of
a
recent
advantage
referred
to
by
them
and
referred
to
by
judge
weinstein
in
his
dissent
show
that
the
overwhelming
number
of
families,
the
natural
relationship
as
congress
obviously
opted
for
here
is
with
the
mother.
but
you’re
quite
right,
we
can’t
claim
and
perhaps
the
cleophus
warner
family
situation
is
a
good
illustration.
there
will
be
because
of
these
classifications
or
cuts
as
i
somewhat
simplistically
call
the.
situations
which
target
the
heartstrings
of
anyone
of
any
--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
because
congress
--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
well,
i
would
urge
very
simply
that
congress
made
a
choice
with
full
recognition.
there
would
be
special
cases
where
hardship,
where
you
as
you
say
might
be
easy
to
prove
but
i
think
congress
was
thinking
at
the
bulk
of
the
cases.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
well,
as
the
argument
has
been
made,
in
the
legislature
as
recent
as
few
months
ago
where
congress
is
considering
a
bill
to
achieve
the
result
which
plaintiffs
urge
in
which
you’re
really
talking
about.
and
one
of
the
considerations
of
course
is
would
it
really
be
that
hard.
but
our
argument
very
simply
is
congress
has
the
right
and
the
power
to
decide
this
and
as
long
as
it’s
rational,
even
though
you
or
i
or
anyone
else
could
think
of
a
better
method,
really
doesn’t
solve
the
problem
from
a
constitutional
basis.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
well,
that
isn’t
the
determination
as
i
understand
it
that
congress
made
here.
congress
approached
this
one
from
another
angle.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
it
seems
perfectly
rational
judgment
although
it’s
vague.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
in
a
great
number
apparently.
apparently
because
of
the
differing
laws
about
legitimate
children
as
oppose
to
illegitimate
children
partly
because
of
different
laws
as
to
records,
partly
because
of
the
horrible
problems
of
proving
or
disapproving
paternity
and
that’s
true
whether
you
are
once
dealing
with
an
alien
or
a
citizen.
i
can’t
deny
that
there
are
cases,
of
course.
but
are
argue
what
basically
comes
down
to
this.
first
if
all
its
congress
that
makes
the
choice,
particularly
when
we’re
dealing
with
questions
of
alienage
and
second
of
all
it
isn’t
irrational
that
to
make
the
cut
as
congress
did
it.
and
i
would
have
to
concede
to,
you
or
anybody
else
that
there
will
be
these
individual
cases.
i
have
to
concede
that
if
you
went
down
carefully
on
a
case
by
case
basis
there
would
be
some
that
with
the
government
would
concede
on
as
you
point
out.
but
then
there
would
be
many,
many
that
the
government
would
not
concede
but
as
congress
has
tried
--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
i
think
mr.
justice
blackmun
said
that
even
more
recently
but
that’s
correct.
and
here,
we
have
to
accept
as
mr.
justice
white’s
point,
there
is
no
doubt
that
there
are
individual
cases
and
you
know
we
only
heard
about
one
of
the
plaintiffs
case
here
this
afternoon.
this
is
perhaps
the
most
appealing
to
many
as
i
agree
with
ms.
calvo
on
that.
the
cases
of
the
other
plaintiffs
are
not
so
appealing
but
i
don’t
think
congress
was
unaware
of
that
problem.
i
think
what
they
decided
to
do
was
to
take
the
problem
on
a
natural
basis
as
they
understood
it
and
as
the
immigration
laws
have
presumed
for
many,
many
years
that
the
rational
or
the
most
rational
place
for
a
child
was
with
the
natural
mother
and
that
illegitimate
or
the
fathers
of
illegitimate
parents
or
illegitimate
children
of
course
in
some
instances
are
very
close
to
their
children
but
in
many
more
instances
are
not.
also,
if
i
may
say
a
father
does
have
a
chance
to
legitimate
his
child
under
the
laws
of
most
every
jurisdiction
whether
within
or
without
the
united
states.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
no,
unfortunately
in
that
case
--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
yes
and
that
presents
a
problem
here.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
that’s
my
understanding
too
and
i
am
sure
there
are
other
cases
going
back
to
justice
white’s
point,
there
is
no
doubt.
but
our
argument
is
that
the
congress
is
entitled
to
make
the
cut
even
where
it
lives
out
some
and
creates
individual
hardships.
indeed,
if
one
looks
at
other
sections
of
the
immigration
law
as
i
am
sure
this
court
knows,
you
will
see
other
forms
of
classification
that
surely
tag
at
the
heartstrings
of
any
one
of
us,
i
assume
and
if
we
were
doing
it
or
if
i
were
doing
it
and
i
admit
i
probably
try
to
do
it
differently.
but
we
urge
that
that’s
congress’
province
as
long
as
they
have
some
reasonable
basis
so
to
do.
thank
you
very
much.
