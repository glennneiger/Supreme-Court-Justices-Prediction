unknown
speaker
how
can
--
i
feel
a
little
difficult
to
understand
the
argument
in
this
case
and
in
the
other
cases
that
it
was
the
--
in
view
of
the
fact
that
congress
did
what
it
did,
how
can
you
argue
that
congress’
purpose
was
to
do
something
else?
this
is
not
a
normal
argument
in
this
case,
we
get
it
in
good
many
cases
and
i
find
it
always
very
difficult
to
follow.
unknown
speaker
unless,
this
is
really
inadvertent,
this
statute
reflects
the
intent
and
purpose
of
congress,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
unless,
it
was
accidental
or
inadvertent
that
i
don’t
understand
that
to
be
any
part
of
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
but
that
isn’t
the
way
we
usually
construe
a
statute
as
it
to
say
that
if
congress
just
had
known
that
this
precise
language
that
they
had
adopted
had
this
effect
on
this
particular
man,
they
wouldn’t
have
passed
on
those
terms?
unknown
speaker
well,
you’re
suggesting
that
because
you
think
that
congress
if
it
had
seen
the
effect
of
the
statute
on
your
client
would
have
passed
a
different
statute
that
we
ought
to
construe
it
in
a
different
way?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
when
you
are
talking
about
the
overriding
purpose
of
congress?
surely
there’s
no
place
where
congressional
purpose
is
better
found
than
in
the
language
congress
has
shown
--
chosen
to
enact
into
a
statute,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
well
but
isn’t
the
logical
inference
from
that
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
promote
family
unity
with
respect
to
that
particular
class
of
individuals
since
it
expressly
excluded
them.
unknown
speaker
well
then
we
usually
do.
unknown
speaker
well
you
think
that’s
better
evidence
of
what
congress
intended
by
the
legislation
and
the
language
that
it
chose?
unknown
speaker
how
old
is
serge
now?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose,
ms.
calvo,
the
government
disagrees
with
your
focus.
it
puts
the
focus
on
the
child,
doesn’t
it,
rather
than
citizen
parent?
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
suppose
that
it
weren’t
mr.
warner
we
were
speaking
of
but
his
parents
who
lived
here
and
were
citizens.
would
they
be
in
a
position
under
the
act
to
bring
in
serge
to
stay
here?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
that
siblings
also
would
not
be
--
unknown
speaker
ms.
calvo,
it
occurs
to
me
that
when
you
emphasize
that
the
discrimination
is
between
parents
of
illegitimate
children
on
the
one
hand
and
parents
of
legitimate
children
on
the
other,
you
really
are
not
entitled
to
rely
on
the
cases
that
rely
on
the
unfairness
of
visiting
the
sins
of
the
parents
on
their
children.
do
you
understand
my
point?
unknown
speaker
it’s
on
account
of
his
own
conduct
whereas
in
the
case
we
just
heard
before,
the
child
was
being
discriminated
against
on
the
count
of
his
natural
parents
conduct.
unknown
speaker
well,
general
tyler,
you
say
in
your
brief
that
the
basis
for
this
action
in
not
giving
the
preference
to
an
illegitimate
child
of
a
father
--
of
an
unwed
father
is
that
the
child
is
among
the
class
or
that
two
--
or
that
the
classification
--
that
the
father
and
the
child
are
members
of
the
class
among
whom
its
unlikely,
there
would
be
any
real
close
identification
and
it’s
on
this
basis
that
the
legislature
at
congress
decided
which
families
to
try
to
reunify
which
family
is
not.
now,
why
--
i
suppose
you
would
concede
that
there
would
be
enough
of
that
--
could
many
father
child
relationships
even
though
the
child
is
illegitimate
where
there
has
been
a
very
close
--
very
close.
unknown
speaker
but
why
not
let
them
prove
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
the
person
seeking
admission
were
the
person
for
whom
the
parent
seeks
admission
for
alleges
in
a
piece
of
paper
certain
facts
that
would
indicate
to
anybody,
there
has
been
a
close
relationship
down
to
the
years.
and
suppose
the
government
in
answering
that
knew
what
the
facts
when
said
“yes,
we
agree.”
now
the
law
would
still
exclude
the
child,
the
illegitimate
child
and
why
not
let
them
prove
it.
i
mean
why
not?
unknown
speaker
why
doesn’t
the
government
want
to
sort
them
out
one
after
an
individual
case
rather
than
it
is
in
a
group?
unknown
speaker
well
i
know
it
was
but
why
--
is
it
just
an
administrative
cause
or
difficulty
of
sorting
them
out
on
individual
cases?
unknown
speaker
you
say
it’s
--
what
is
the
rational
of
it
in
excluding
the
--
in
the
particular
child’s
case
if
there
has
been
a
close
association
down
through
the
years
then
government
admits
it.
what
is
the
rationality?
unknown
speaker
i
know
what
congress
said,
i’m
just
trying
to
see
what
you
say
is
a
rational.
unknown
speaker
is
it
rational
because
it’s
too
hard
to
prove
it
in
some
other
cases
and
therefore
you
don’t
want
to
[voice
overlap].
unknown
speaker
and
that
cannot
be
done
in
this?
unknown
speaker
unless
the
mother
is
remarried?
unknown
speaker
and
apparently
under
the
local
law
of
where
it
is
in
the
caribbean
legitimation
could
occur
only
by
marriage
of
the
parents.
that’s
my
understanding.
unknown
speaker
ms.
calvo,
can
i
interrupt
you
for
just
a
second?
you
suggest
that
the
stereotype
here
is
that
there
is
not
a
very
close
relationship
between
a
natural
father
and
his
illegitimate
child.
and
that
it’s
wrong
to
legislate
on
the
basis
stereotype.
i
think
you
probably
would
acknowledge
however,
that
there
are
good
many
instances
in
which
there
is
not
a
close
relationship
between
a
natural
father
and
illegitimate
child
and
i
just
wondering,
how
does
one
decide
when
it
becomes
a
stereotype
because
there
are
some
case
that
fits
and
some
who
don’t.
unknown
speaker
oh!
i
understand,
this
particular
case,
you
are
saying
this
does
not
fit
the
stereotype
but
how
do
i
know
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
stereotype
at
all,
that’s
what
i’m
--
in
other
words
that
the
classification
itself
doesn’t
have
sufficient
generality
to
be
illegitimate
to
the
legislative
decision.
unknown
speaker
well
taking
the
father
and
mother
would
you
not
acknowledge
that
more
frequently
there
is
a
close
relationship
between
the
mother
and
the
illegitimate
child
than
there
is
between
the
father
and
the
illegitimate
child.
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
trying
to
figure
out
you
acknowledge
there
are
some
difference
but
can’t
you
say
that
the
one
relationship
is
a
stereotype
and
i
have
walked
and
wrestled
with
this
problem
when
does
something
become
a
stereotype,
that’s
what
i
don’t
quite
understand.
unknown
speaker
but
calvo,
could
congress
pass
an
act
denying
a
citizenship
to
any
illegitimate
alien?
unknown
speaker
could
congress
pass
an
act
denying
citizenship
to
any
illegitimate
alien
--
period?
unknown
speaker
and
as
to
my
question
is?
unknown
speaker
ms.
calvo,
general
tyler
referred
to
the
fact
that
sometimes
in
the
country
of
origin
a
child
maybe
legitimated.
does
this
record
show
whether
that
was
possible
in
the
french
west
indies
where
serge
was
born?
unknown
speaker
that
was
the
only
way?
unknown
speaker
of
course
we
have
cases
other
than
the
warner
case
here
don’t
you?
unknown
speaker
are
they
moot
now?
do
you
feel
they
are
moot?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
wondered
because
neither
of
you
has
mentioned
any
case
other
than
mr.
warner,
but
they
are
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
probably
didn’t
focus
on
it
because
the
warner
case
is
the
best
case
by
far
that
you
have.[laughter]
unknown
speaker
it’s
also
all
you
need,
isn’t
it?
