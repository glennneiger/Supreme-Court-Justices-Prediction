ms.
janet
m.
calvo
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
in
appeal
--
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
thank
you.
this
case
is
in
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
a
divided
three-judge
court
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york.
the
challenge
statutes
in
this
case,
afford
statutory
right
to
united
states
citizen
parents
which
makes
it
possible
for
them
to
live
in
this
country
with
their
alien
children.
it
does
so
by
allowing
the
parent
to
request
an
exemption
of
his
alien
child
from
restrictive
numerical
quota
and
labor
certification
requirements.
as
fully
explained
in
our
reply
brief,
the
recent
amendments
to
the
immigration
act
now
the
scope
of
this
case
respectively
to
the
issue
of
the
united
states
citizen
parent
seeking
the
classification
of
his
alien
child
as
an
immediate
relative
and
thus
exempt
from
labor
certification
and
quota
requirements.
while
other
similarly
situated
parents
made
proof
their
family
relationship
with
their
children
and
thereby
obtain
their
entry
into
the
united
states.
citizen
fathers
of
illegitimate
children
are
completely
precluded
from
proving
their
parent-child
relationship.
thus,
cleophus
warner,
even
though
he
has
formally
acknowledged
his
child
always
supported
his
child,
lives
with
his
child,
loves
and
cares
for
his
child
is
completely
unable
to
prove
his
relationship
with
his
child
and
to
achieve
his
goal
of
living
with
his
child
in
this
country.
this
case
is
unique
one
in
the
immigration
law
context
on
several
grounds.
first
and
foremost,
this
case
involves
the
rights
of
citizens
not
of
aliens.
the
challenge
statutes
were
designed
to
achieve
the
benevolent
result
of
allowing
a
united
states
citizen
parent
to
live
together
with
his
child.
but
the
statute
discriminates
against
some
united
state
citizen
parents,
the
fathers
of
illegitimate
children.
in
doing
so,
the
statute
infringe
on
these
citizens
fundamental
interests
in
their
parent-child
relationship
and
as
a
possible
consequence
the
incidents
of
their
citizenship.
mr.
warner
is
put
to
an
impossible
choice.
he
may
give
up
his
desire
to
care
for
and
live
with
his
child
and
be
able
to
live
in
this
country,
the
country
of
his
citizenship.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
for
mr.
warner,
it
is
in
a
serious
--
by
impossible,
i
mean
very
serious
infringement
on
his
choice
to
live
in
the
united
states,
the
country
of
his
citizenship.
in
fact
his
citizenship
was
a
very
hard
earned
one
as
mr.
warner
is
a
naturalized
citizen
of
the
united
states.
he
chooses
to
live
in
this
country
and
he
has
made
that
know
by
becoming
a
naturalized
citizen
and
living
here
for
many
years.
another
factor
which
makes
this
case
a
unique
immigration
case
is
that
the
legislative
history
discloses
the
total
absence
of
any
foreign
policy
concerns
or
a
congressional
choice
to
exclude
or
expel
a
group
of
aliens
who
are
perceived
to
post
a
threat
to
our
national
security
or
to
our
general
welfare.
illegitimate
children
are
not
an
excludable
class
under
the
statute
and
therefore
there
is
no
determination
that
they
are
any
danger
to
us.
these
factors
demonstrate
that
this
case
is
fundamentally
different
from
any
of
those
prior
immigration
cases
upon
which
the
government
relies.
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
actual
and
expressed
congressional
purpose
in
passing
the
challenged
statute
was
to
allow
citizen
parents
to
choose
to
live
with
their
alien
children
in
this
country.
but
the
statute
presumes
that
a
citizen
father
will
never
have
close
ties
with
his
alien
illegitimate
child
and
will
never
want
to
choose
to
live
with
him
in
the
united
states.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
i
think
there
is
--
maybe
the
difference
is
between
classification
and
purpose.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
which
evidences
--
any
other
intention
as
an
overriding
purpose
on
behalf
of
congress
other
than
allowing
parents
to
live
with
their
children.
of
course
to
the
extent
that
a
certain
group
is
left
out
at
the
classification
system,
they
therefore
intended
it
by
omission
to
leave
them
out.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
well
i
--
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
no.
we
feel
that
if
in
consideration
of
the
overriding
purpose
of
congress,
if
they
new
that
a
man
like
mr.
warner
who
has
acknowledged
his
child
and
always
cared
for
his
child
and
lives
with
his
child
would
be
totally
barred
from
proving
his
relationship
with
his
child
and
completely
barred
from
living
with
his
child.
they
would
have
intended
that
result
because
what
congress
was
basically
concerned
with
was
allowing
citizen
parents
to
be
united
with
their
children
in
the
united
states.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
pardon
me
i
didn’t
understand
the
question.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
no,
i
am
not
arguing
that,
i
am
just
arguing
that
with
regard
to
the
overwriting
purpose
of
congress
the
classifications
has
drawn
are
irrational
and
don’t
serve
that
purpose.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
i
think
that
there
is
a
confusion
between
classification
and
purpose.
you
could
say
in
a
case
in
which
a
legislature
said
that
we
are
building
a
school
for
white
children,
we
do
not
want
black
children
to
attend
that.
that
basically
fulfilled
their
purpose
because
that
was
the
way
the
classification
was
drawn.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
from
the
legislative
history,
congress
specifically
stated
that
by
creating
a
statute
they
were
intending
to
promote
the
family
unity
of
the
united
states
citizen
and
we
are
further
contending
that
the
classification
which
leaves
out
the
fathers
of
illegitimate
children
does
not
promote
family
unity
and
in
fact
--
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
but
you
could
say
that
about
any
statute.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
i
think
there
is
a
confusion
between
classification
and
purpose,
i
mean
the
--
i
think
that
in
its
recent
cases
this
court
has
looked
very
closely
at
what
congress
said
itself
was
doing
in
its
legislative
history
and
that
--
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
i
think
that
there
is
a
confusion
with
intent
and
purpose.
i’m
not
arguing
that
there
was
any
--
that
it
is
any
other
than
the
classification
leaves
out
fathers
of
illegitimate
children.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
yes
it
did
go
part
of
the
way.
it
did
go
part
of
the
way
by
presuming
that
parents
similarly
situated
to
a
citizen
father
of
an
illegitimate
children
--
of
an
illegitimate
child
who
always
have
close
ties
with
their
children.
for
example
under
the
stepparent
provision
of
the
law,
if
mr.
warner
married,
he
would
be
presumed
to
have
close
ties
with
his
wife’s
illegitimate
child.
ties
that
he
is
presumed
never
to
have
with
his
own
child,
and
on
the
other
hand,
his
wife
would
be
presumed
to
have
close
ties
with
serge
his
illegitimate
child,
ties
that
the
father
himself
is
presumed
never
to
have.
this
is
similarly
true
under
other
provisions
of
the
statute,
a
father
who
fortuitously
lived
in
a
place
where
an
action
on
his
--
by
himself,
he
was
capable
of
legitimating
his
child.
for
example,
by
a
simple
acknowledgment
would
be
presumed
to
always
have
close
ties
with
the
child
while
a
man
like
mr.
warner
who
has
not
only
acknowledged
the
child
but
always
supported
the
child
and
lives
with
the
child
because
he
doesn’t
happen
to
live
in
such
a
place
is
completely
precluded
from
even
proving
his
parent-child
relationship.
also
an
adoptive
parent,
a
prospective
adoptive
parent
and
the
mother
of
an
illegitimate
child
under
the
statute
are
presumed
to
always
have
close
ties
with
their
children
while
the
father
of
an
illegitimate
child
no
matter
how
close
his
ties
maybe
in
reality
is
totally
barred
from
proving
his
close
ties
and
its
presumed
not
to
have
this
close
ties.
basically,
what
we
are
contesting
is
this
total
barring
under
the
statute,
especially
in
this
case
where
the
fundamental
interest
of
a
parent
in
the
care
and
companionship
of
his
child
is
involved.
mr.
warner’s
case
illustrates
it,
he
is
--
because
of
the
abandonment
of
the
mother,
the
only
parent
this
child
has
and
he
is
willing
to
take
responsibility
for
that
child
as
he
always
has
and
wishes
to
live
with
the
child
in
this
country
in
order
to
do
so.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
now.
i
think
he’s
about
16.
he
was
much
younger
of
course
when
the
case
began.
it’s
been
around
for
quite
a
long
time.
the
government
attempts
to
defend
the
discrimination
in
this
case
on
the
ground
of
purported
administrative
inconvenience
in
the
prevention
of
spurious
claims.
there
where
absolutely
no
congressional
expression
that
vis-à-vis
unwed
fathers,
they
were
concerned
about
administrative
inconvenience.
but
in
any
event
the
challenge
potential
--
the
alleged
potential
for
his
spurious
claims
does
not
justify
the
discrimination
in
this
case.
this
is
because
any
potential
for
his
spurious
claims
in
the
case
of
a
father
of
an
illegitimate
child
is
no
different
than
the
potential
for
spurious
claims
for
many
other
parents
who
are
covered
by
the
challenge
statutes.
for
example,
under
the
stepparent
provision,
the
immigration
and
councilor
officials
would
have
to
make
the
same
exact
determination
as
they
would
have
to
make
in
this
case,
the
paternity
of
an
illegitimate
child.
practically,
if
i
may
point
out,
they
already
have
routine
methods
of
doing
so.
they
have
a
system
setup,
they
have
forms,
they
know
what
kind
of
proof
they
want
to
prove
these
relationships.
we
do
not
contest
or
contend
with
any
rigorous
burdens
of
proof
that
are
imposed.
what
we
seek
in
this
case
is
only
the
opportunity
of
the
unwed
father
of
an
illegitimate
child
to
prove
his
relationship
by
whatever
proof
the
immigration
or
councilor
officials
impose
upon
him.
it
is
clear
under
the
law
that
the
burden
of
proof
lies
with
the
parent
of
seeking
the
benefit
for
his
child.
in
summary,
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
it
cannot
be
over
emphasized
that
what
is
involved
here
is
the
rights
of
citizens
who,
like
mr.
warner
have
always
acknowledged
and
supported
in
take
good
care
of
their
children
and
who
wish
only
to
be
treated
like
other
parents
and
in
giving
an
opportunity
to
prove
this
relationship.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
yes
that
is
an
entirely
erroneous
focus
your
honor.
if
the
parent
does
not
request
that
the
child
entered
the
states,
the
child
does
not
enter
the
states
that’s
by
statute
at
section
204
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
the
benefit
is
given
only
to
the
citizen
parent.
the
child
cannot
claim
entry
under
the
challenged
statutes
merely
because
he
is
related
to
a
citizen.
the
citizen
has
to
specifically
request
that
this
be
done
on
behalf
of
his
child.
the
citizen
also
has
to
further
agree
that
he
will
take
care
of
the
child,
support
the
child.
he
must
reveal
his
assets,
his
--
and
he
must
meet
specific
limitations
which
demonstrate
that
he
is
capable
and
willing
to
support
the
child
while
the
child
is
in
the
united
states.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
the
grandparents?
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
no,
your
honor.
the
special
provisions
of
the
act
relate
to
parents
of
children.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
no,
this
is
a
very
narrow
situation.
it’s
a
situation
that
deals
only
with
the
parent-child
relationship.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
i
believe
that
there
are
cases
in
which
illegitimacy
discrimination
has
also
and
i
believe
it
was
in
the
companion
case
to
levi,
the
glona
case.
the
illegitimacy
discrimination
was
against
the
parent
as
well.
here
there
is
--
the
party
is
the
parent
and
the
parent
is
discriminated
against
in
several
different
ways
in
comparison
with
several
other
similarly
situated
parents.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
that’s
true.
if
you
have
no
further
questions,
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
thank
you.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
i
do.
what
the
government
attempts
to
justify
here
is
a
determination
made
on
the
basis
of
a
bare
stereotype
which
allows
total
foreclosure
of
a
group
of
people
and
in
doing
so
infringes
on
a
fundamental
interest
in
a
parent-child
relationship.
now,
maybe
a
reference
to
a
recent
case
would
be
helpful.
in
mathews
versus
lucas,
distinctions
were
upheld
specifically
because
they
did
not
completely
and
totally
foreclose
a
group
from
proving
the
objective
or
the
necessary
of
objecting
that
case
which
was
dependency.
this
was
compared
to
the
case
of
jimenez
in
which
the
classifications
were
very
similar,
but
the
group
of
people
in
that
case
were
totally
precluded
from
proving
dependency
which
was
the
object
in
that
case
also.
in
this
case,
there
is
a
stereotype
that
fathers
of
illegitimate
children
don’t
care
a
whit
about
their
children.
i
believe
that
we
have
shown
in
our
briefs
that
this
stereotype
just
isn’t
valid
that
there
are
many,
many
fathers
who
do
care
about
their
children
and
our
particular
concern
in
this
case
is
with
our
plaintiffs
who
do
care
about
their
children.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
i
believe
that
their
concept
of
a
generality
of
human
experience
results
in
a
stereotype
here
and
i
don’t
believe
that
legislating
on
the
basis
of
a
stereotype
when
it
totally
forecloses
a
group
of
people
from
proving
the
object
which
is
in
this
case
of
family
relationship
is
constitutionally
justified.
i
also
might
point
out
in
that
regard
that
the
classifications
in
this
case
aren’t
only
just
mother
father
although
we
do
say
that
that
is
discriminatory,
you
also
have
another
classification
like
the
stepparent
classification
which
is
completely
and
totally
irrational.
you
can’t
presume
that
a
man
is
going
to
have
close
ties
with
his
wife’s
child
but
not
with
his
own
and
that
she
is
going
to
have
close
ties
with
his
child
that
he
never
has.
that
that
is
the
most
irrational
example
in
that
situation.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
i
think
in
this
case
that
it’s
--
there
has
been
sufficient
proof
brought
to
show
that
it
isn’t
a
stereotype
--
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
there
are
several
classifications
that
are
comparable
here.
it’s
comparing
the
father
with
the
mother
but
also
comparing
the
father
in
a
stepparent
situation
or
fathers
with
fathers.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
in
that
situation
there
may
be
but
that
does
not
justify
totally
--
it
does
not
justify
totally
foreclosing
the
father.
maybe
it
might
justify
imposing
differing
burdens
of
proof
upon
him
but
it
doesn’t
justify
completely
and
totally
wiping
him
out
when
his
fundamental
interest
in
his
parent
child
relationship
is
involved.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
well,
i
think
that
this
court
does
has
had
before
in
many
cases
in
which
fathers
have
--
fathers
of
illegitimate
children
having
close
with
their
children.
the
most
recent
one
is
the
jimenez
case
in
which
mr.
jimenez
was
the
sole
caring
parent
of
those
children.
and
i
also
believe
that
the
statistics
that
we
presented
show
that
there
are
substantial
number
of
fathers
who
live
with
their
children,
that
those
fathers
who
don’t
live
with
their
children
very
often
support
them
and
visit
them
and
perform
the
sociological
functions
of
their
father
who
didn’t
take
responsibility
for
the
children.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
would
you
repeat
that
i’m
sorry
i
didn’t
hear
you.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
that
would
be
a
different
case
from
this
one
because
in
that
case
there
would
only
be
the
rights
of
aliens
involved.
that
case
would
--
a
determination
in
this
case
that
this
law
is
unconstitutional
would
not
necessitate
in
that
case
a
determination,
there
are
different
considerations
in
that
situation.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
i
think
it
would
--
i
have
not
thought
about
it.
i
think
that
it
would
have
to
be
resolved
on
the
basis
of
its
own
merits
and
i
would
have
to
think
about
it
more
before
i
could
give
you
a
specific
answer
on
that.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
yes,
it
shows
that
that
the
only
way
that
the
child
could
be
legitimated
in
guadeloupe
was
by
marriage
of
the
parents
and
this
mother
did
not
choose
marry
mr.
warner
she
chose
to
marry
somebody
else.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
yes
that
is
the
only
way.
and
that’s
fairly
common
in
many
places
that
this
concept
of
legitimation
or
legitimate.
some
children
are
legitimate
when
born
even
though
they
are
born
out
of
wedlock.
some
children
of
adulterous
relationships
are
legitimate
also.
in
other
places
they’re
--
children
are
legitimate
only
if
the
parents
marry.
for
example,
in
some
places
a
father
could
have
custody
of
a
child
and
be
supporting
the
child
and
always
live
with
the
child
but
he
is
totally
incapable
of
making
the
child
legitimate
under
the
law
of
the
area.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
yes,
those
--
we
didn’t
focus
on
those
only
because
of
the
change
in
the
law.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
no,
we
don’t
think
--
they
are
not
moot
because
the
recent
amendments
contained
the
savings
clause
which
provided
that
if
an
application
were
made
before
the
effective
date
of
the
law
which
is
not
yet
that
those
people
would
be
entitled
to
whatever
benefits
they
would
have
been
entitled
to
wonder
the
old
law.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
that’s
right
we
did
not
focus
on
that
case
because
basically
the
issue
that
those
other
cases
presented
is
not
really
an
issue
except
for
those
two
people
at
this
point.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
well,
i
think
the
other
cases
have
--
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
i
think
that
i
would
--
i’d
like
to
--
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
i
think
that
your
honor,
the
government
tries
to
claim
that
it’s
common
experience
and
i
am
determining
--
saying
that
its
not
common
experience
because
we
have
shown
that
there
is
enough
evidence
and
the
individual
fact
situations
the
case
show
it
and
also
the
sociological
data
and
the
empirical
data
show
it.
even
the
sense
as
pure
data
shows
it
and
all
the
studies
that
were
cited
in
the
brief
were
all
government
studies.
they
show
it,
that
fathers
do
care
about
their
illegitimate
children.
ms.
janet
m.
calvo
i
think
that
what
the
problem
in
this
case
is
that
it’s
a
total
foreclosure
and
i
think
that
when
there
is
an
individual
and
or
substantial
member
of
individuals
who
have
close
ties
with
their
children
you
can’t
completely
and
totally
wipe
them
out,
foreclose
them
on
the
basis
of
some
presumptions.
i
believe
my
time
is
up.
thank
you,
your
honor.
