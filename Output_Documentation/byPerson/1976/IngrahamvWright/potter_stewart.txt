and
it
is
also
to
try
to
get
this
decree.
justice

stewart
well,
it
was
precisely
the
same
thing
in
both
trop
and
in
perez,
i.e.
the
deprivation
of
citizenship.
and,
the
reason
it
was
punishment
in
the
one
case,
in
trop,
and
not
punishment
in
perez
is
one,
i
had
understood
or
one
could
understand
was
that
in
trop,
it
followed
a
conviction
of
a
criminal
offence.
and,
isn't
that
what
made
it
punishment.
justice
potter
stewart
let
us
say,
it
was
part
of
the
sanction
imposed
upon
one
convicted
of
criminal
offence
and
in
the
other
case
there
was
no
criminal
proceeding
whatsoever.
now,
isnâ€™t
that
what
made
the
same
consequence,
punishment
in
the
one
case
and
not
punishment
in
the
other.
justice
potter
stewart
why
was
it
punishment
in
the
one
case
and
not
in
the
other?
justice
potter
stewart
they
precise
same
thing.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
source
of
congressional
power
is
not
really
relevant
here.
is
it
so
long
as
it
so,
one
might
inquire
upon
whether
or
not
it
was
an
appropriate
exercise
of
power
granted
by
the
constitution
to
the
federal
legislature,
but,
once
one
found
an
affirmative
answer
to
that,
then
the
question
is,
did
congress
enact
a
criminal
law
or
a
civil
law?
congress
has
enacted
many
criminal
laws
under
its
commerce
power,
the
dyer
act,
the
mann
act,
and
many,
many
others.
now,
i
suppose,
and
it
is
enacted
as
we
both
know
many,
many
kinds
of
civil
legislation
under
its
commerce
power.
but,
the
question
is
not
the
source
of
congressional
power
but
whether
or
not
this
is,
what
has
been
created
as
a
criminal
offence
followed
both
by
criminal
sanction,
if
so,
is
punishment,
and
if
it
is
not,
it
is
not.
