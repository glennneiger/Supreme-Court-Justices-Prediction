chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
6527
ingraham
against
wright.
mr.
rogow
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
has
no
focus
on
who
delivers
it.
if
a
stranger
walks
up
to
you
on
the
streets
and
hits
you
over
the
head
with
the
club
thatâ€™s
probably
is
some
punishment,
now
does
the
eighth
amendment
apply
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
are
talking
about
the
authority
of
government
in
somewhere.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
analogizing
this
to
a
military
service
under
the
draft
for
example
and
would
you
say
there
that
a
person
in
a
military
service
who
was
required
for
some
disciplinary
reason
to
stand
up
for
48
hours
or
some
such
thing
would
be
within
the
reach
of
eighth
amendment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
make
it
to
96
hours
and
certainly
that
could
be
excessive
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
that
were
ordered
by
a
superior
officer
in
the
circumstances
where
you
have
to
comply
then
you
say
that
the
eighth
amendment
would
be
invoked.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
distinction
between
injury
and
pain,
would
you
make
any
distinction
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
fourteenth
amendment
argument
is
tied
to
punishment,
just
as
your
eighth
amendment
argument.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
any
difference
in
definition,
of
punishment
for
your
fourteenth
amendment
argument
and
for
punishment
in
your
eighth
amendment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
have
about
eight
minutes
i
think
we
will
let
you
go
ahead
mr.
howard.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
square
that
with
what
the
court
said
in
strickland?
if
records
where
now
to
say
the
same
general
procedures
provided
for
strickland
against
wood
case
would
apply
here,
would
that
be
an
extension,
or
would
you
regard
that
as
an
extension
of
law.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel
i
think
we
will
resume
that
in
the
afternoon.
