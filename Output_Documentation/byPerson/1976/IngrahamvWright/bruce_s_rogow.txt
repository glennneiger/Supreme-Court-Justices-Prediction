mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
three
issues
in
this
case;
the
first
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
eighth
amendment
is
cruel
on
unusual
punishment
clause,
has
any
application
to
public
school
students
who
are
beaten
by
their
teachers
or
principals.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
held
an
affect
that
no
matter
how
brutal
how
severe,
how
excessive
the
beating
is
inflicted
upon
public
schools
students,
they
may
seek
no
relief
under
the
eighth
amendment
that
is
the
first
issue.
the
second
issue
is
if
the
eighth
amendment
does
apply
as
we
submit
it
does.
whether
or
not
the
facts
of
this
case
show
that
these
student’s
eighth
amendment’s
right
have
been
violated,
the
third
issue
which
is
separate
and
distinct,
is
whether
or
not
any
corporal
punishment
inflicted
by
an
instrument
designed
to
cause
bodily
injury,
whether
or
not
that
punishment
must
be
proceeded
by
some
opportunity
to
be
heard
under
the
14th
amendment’s
due
process
clause.
the
court
of
appeal’s
decision
was
that
there
was
no
need
for
such
a
hearing.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
sir,
i
will
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
in
fact
i
turned
out
to
the
eighth
amendment
argument.
the
effect
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
as
i
mentioned
is
to
give
carte
blanche
to
teachers
and
principals
to
punish
corporally
as
severely
as
excessively
as
they
may
do
and
there
will
be
no
recourse
under
the
eighth
amendment.
the
decision
seems
to
focus
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
punishment
is
imposed
in
a
criminal
setting
or
a
civil
setting
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
eighth
amendment
only
applies
in
the
criminal
context.
we
believe
that
decision
misses
the
point
of
the
eighth
amendment.
the
focus
of
the
eighth
amendment
is
upon
punishment,
it
is
not
upon
who
delivers
the
punishment.
the
original
purpose
of…
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no
it
does
not
mr.
chief
justice
because…
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
exactly
punishment
imposed
under
color
of
state
law
which
are
the
facts
of
this
case
and
which
is
the
kind
of
punishment
we
are
talking
about
here.
the
original
purpose
of
the
eighth
amendment
was
to
preclude
the
barbaric
kinds
of
punishments
which
were
known
in
the
15th,
16th,
17th,
18th
centuries
in
england
and
on
the
continent.
to
be
sure
the
drafters
look
back,
looked
at
history
and
saw
terrible
punishments
imposed
in
a
criminal
context
generally
and
that
is
what
they
sought
to
ban
in
the
eighth
amendment
because
that
is
what
they
saw
in
the
past,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
there
was
to
be
no
ban
on
punishments
imposed
by
other
people
acting
under
color
of
state
law
if
those
punishments
were
excessive
and
severe.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
i
was
mr.
justice.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
if
he
had
done
it
as
a
summary
punishment
in
arresting
the
person,
take
him
into
custody
and
then
similarly
punishing
him
depriving
him
of
the
right
to
be
trailed
then
i
could
say
that
would
be
a
violation
of
due
process
right
but
not
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
would
say
it
wasn’t
the
cruel
unusual
punishment
because,
it’s
a
difficult
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist
probably
because
if
he
is
not
been
addressed
in
that
context,
generally
there
was
another
clear
constitutional
right
that
has
been
violated
but
as
i
reflect
on
it,
i
think
that
could
begin
to
give
rise
to
a
cruel
unusual
punishment,
the
only
withdrawing
i
might
do
from
that
position
might
be
that,
that
kind
of
punishment
is
not
authorized
at
all
by
law,
with
the
kind
of
punishment
we
are
talking
about
here
is
at
the
outset
authorized
by
law
and
then
it’s
exceeded.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
it
was
in
a
limited
context
reasonable
corporal
punishment.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
they
did
and
this
court
has
recognized
all
that
the
eighth
amendment
is
a
dynamic
evolving
concept
and
what
may
have
been
tolerated
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
eighth
amendment
hasn’t
been
tolerated
as
we
progressed
in
our
society
standards
of
decency
and
civilized
notions.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no
we
do
not
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
we
are
only
arguing
this
case
and
we
are
saying
that
reasonable
corporal
punishment
will
not
be
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment.
we
are
saying
that
physical
corporal
punishment
imposed
by
an
instrument
will
have
to
be
proceeded
by
an
opportunity
for
hearing
that
is
our
fourteenth
amendment
argument
which
is
separate
and
distinct
from
this,
but
we
are
not
seeking
to
outlaw
all
corporal
punishment
in
a
public
school
context
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
issue
would
be
at
that
hearing
whether
or
not
the
student
did
in
fact
commit
the
offence
for
which
she
has
been
punished.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
certainly
the
kind
of
punishment
that
ought
to
be
inflicted.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
he
is
deprived
of
the
liberty
interest
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
a
liberty
interest
that
is
drawn
really
from
nearly
all
the
amendments
of
the
constitution.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no
i’m
sorry
at
least
the
first
ten,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
liberty
interest,
the
right
to
be
treated
with
human
dignity
is
at
least
in
interest
and
liberty.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
is
not
specifically
stated
–
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
among
the
per-numbers
and
included
among
the
per-numbers
are
--
and
let
me
list
those
rights
that
have
been
violated,
that
we
think
make
up
the
constellation
of
factors
involving
liberty.
the
right
to
be
free
from
bodily
restraint
and
a
student
is
restraint,
the
right
to
be
free
from…
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
can't
name
specific
amendments
i
can
come
to
the
fourth
amendment
perhaps
with
the
physical
kind
of
intrusion
that’s
involved
but
this
court
is
never
required
a
specific
amendment
to
be
named
when
one
is
talking
about
liberty
because
the
concept
of
liberty
is
broad
and
it
includes
an
awful
lot
of
privileges
that
are
essential
to
the
practice
of
the
liberty
by
free
people
and
free
children.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no
it
is
not
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
maybe…
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no
i
think
liberty
is
something
that…
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
think
we
do
have
to
pinpoint
it,
and
i’m
attempting
to
pinpoint
it
by
looking
at
a
host
of
factors
which
this
court
has
looked
at
many
times
in
deciding
whether
or
not
there
is
or
is
not
a
liberty
interest,
the
freedom
from
bodily
restraint,
from
bodily
intrusion,
by
officers
acting
under
color
of
state
law
beatings
in
affect,
the
freedom
from
being
stigmatized
ridiculed,
psychologically
harmed,
having
one’s
privacy
invaded,
having
one’s
reputation,
honor
and
integrity
invaded.
when
the
government
does
that
acting
under
the
color
of
state
law
we
submit
that
those
things
constitute
of
deprivation
of
liberty,
but
that
mr.
justice
marshall
is
my
due
process
argument
and
i
would
like
to
give
back
to
my
eighth
amendment
argument
and
then
address
these
due
process
issues
once
again.
the
court
is
recognized
in
the
eighth
amendment
concept
because
we
think
this
is
important
that
a
principle
to
be
vital
must
be
capable
of
wider
application
and
the
mischief
which
gave
it
birth.
the
court
said
that
in
weems
versus
united
states
where
it
held
unconstitutional
as
an
eighth
amendment
violation.
12
years
of
hard
labor
for
fraudulently
signing
a
public
document
and
in
robinson
versus
california
the
court
held
that
imprisonment
for
drug
addiction
could
amount
to
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
so
the
court
has
recognized
that
the
eighth
amendment
is
a
dynamic
evolving
concept
and
that
it
focuses
upon
punishment
and
that’s
what
we
have
in
this
case,
we
have
excessive
punishment
that
the
fifth
circuit
would
tolerate
and
say
the
eighth
amendment
offers
no
relief
from
it.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
there
certainly
could
be
changing
and
evolving
standards
of
what
would
be
tolerated
by
society.
so,
there
could
be
some
change
because
as
i
said
the
fifth
circuit
is
flexible
and
dynamic
--
i’m
sorry
the
eighth
amendment
is
flexible
and
dynamic.
the
fifth
circuit
was
not
so
flexible
in
this
court,
this
case.
because
we
think
the
eighth
amendment
applies,
we
turn
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
we
think
shows
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment
and
these
are
the
facts.
at
least
four
of
the
people
who
testified,
four
of
the
children
these
are
13,
14,
15
year
old
children
had
to
receive
medical
treatment.
one
of
them
james
ingraham
suffered
a
severe
hematoma
he
was
unable
to
sit
down
for
three
weeks,
another
roosevelt
andrews
loss
the
use
of
his
hand
and
had
to
seek
medical
attention,
another
one
had
a
lump
on
his
forehead
from
the
paddle
which
had
to
be
lanced
surgically
treated
and
left
a
scar,
another
daniel
lee.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
it
was.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
because
there
was
a
41-b
dismal
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
in
effect
of
motion
for
directed
verdict
at
the
end
of
the
plaintiff’s
case
was
granted.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
so
the
case
is
resolved
with
that
point
in
the
district
court.
daniel
lee
fractured
his
hand
and
had
a
dislocated
knuckle,
which
the
district
court
looked
at
in
the
record
saw
that
there
was
scar
even
still
left
from
that.
people
missed
school,
some
of
the
descriptions
that
are
involved
in
this
record
are
unique
we
think
in
the
annals
of
punishment
in
the
educational
setting.
children
hollering,
crying,
praying,
screaming
and
yet
still
being
punished
and
one
rodney
william
said
that
he
was
begging
for
mercy
as
he
was
hit
with
the
paddle
and
then
he
was
hit
with
the
belt
and
then
his
words
and
tears
was
coming
out
of
me.
they
were
repeated
blows
50
blows
to
one
student
for
allegedly
making
a
obscene
telephone
call.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
applies.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
they
are.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
because
the
focus
is
upon
punishment
and
merely
as
i
said
before
mr.
justice.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it’s
hard
for
me
to
state
what
exactly
the
founders
felt
but
i
believe
that
they
must
have
thought
that
punishment
imposed
by
the
government
cannot
be
so
severe
and
so
excessive
that
it
would
amount
to
the
kind
of
violations
of
human
dignity
which
they
saw
occurring
in
the
near
past,
in
england
and
along
the
continent.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
not,
it
is
not
necessary
to
my
analysis
of
the
eighth
amendment
but
there
is
in
some
limited
way
that
custody
concept
even
here
in
a
public
school
setting.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
i
don’t
tie
it
to
custody.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
if
it
were
done
for
the
purpose
of
punishment,
perhaps
it
could
reach
to
the
level
of
eighth
amendment
violation.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
don’t
think
that
kind
of
force
does
not
rise
to
the
excessive
punishment
that
we
are
talking
about.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
but
you
were
not
punishing
someone,
under
authority
given
to
you
by
federal
law
or
by
state
law
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
authority
maybe
to
be
conform
mr.
justice
stuart
but
the
authority
is
not
to
punish
and
in
the
case
that
we
are
talking
about
the
authority
to
the
school
master
heads
is
to
punish,
when
he
exceeds
that
authority,
then
in
such
a
severe
and
excessive
way
than
one
gets
over
in
to
an
eighth
amendment
violation.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no
it
is
not
gone.
there
are
several
things
that
i
do
with
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
first
is
to
explain
it
in
its
historical
concept.
first
of
all
it
was
the
product
of
a
voluntary
school
or
educational
system,
were
parents
could
choose
to
send
their
children,
or
not
send
their
children
to
school.
that
is
not
the
situation
today,
children
must
be
sent
to
school
and
to
some
extent
that
ties
in
with
the
custody
notion
that
is
involved
here.
secondly,
if
parents
have
some
way
at
least
to
say
i
withdraw
my
this
assumed
delegation
to
a
teacher
then
perhaps
one
could
say
well
there
may
not
need
to
be
a
hearing
before
the
punishment
is
imposed
because
the
parent
has
already
given
their
authority
to
do
it,
but
there
cannot
be
that
withdrawal
the
way
the
law
stands
today.
so,
a
parent
is
committed
to
sending
his
children
to
school,
he
has
no
say
or
she
has
no
say,
about
what
kind
of
punishment
is
inflicted
in
that
school
and
we
submit
at
the
local
parent’s
argument
does
not
permit
because
there
has
been
assumed
delegation
excessive
beatings
and
it
doesn’t
permit
of
beating
without
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
person
could
be,
if
the
punishment
was
excessive.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
as
i
say
it
depends
upon
the
facts
of
the
case,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
96
hours
of
standing
would
be
excessive
punishment
and
it
is
punishment.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
could
be
invoked,
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
it
is.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
there
are.
the
due
process
right
to
be
heard,
which
we
argue
is
not
titled
at
all
to
the
eighth
amendment
argument.
we
are
not
saying
one
can
justify
severe
and
excessive
beatings
by
giving
a
hearing
before
one
administers
those
kinds
of
beatings.
what
we
are
saying
is
when
one
is
beaten
with
an
instrument
designed
to
cause
bodily
injury,
that
beating
infringes
upon
the
liberty
rights.so
liberty
rights…
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no
i
do
not
mean
to
slap
mr.
justice.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no
it
would
not,
it
is…
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
if
the
karate,
i
see
situations
in
which
the
hands
can
be
used
as
instruments
to
do
as
much
danger
as
a
paddle.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
would
not
focus
on
injury,
or
pain,
i
would
focus
on
punishment,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don’t
want
to
have
to
measure
afterwards
whether
or
not
there
was
an
entitlement
to
hear
and
what
we
are
saying
is
when
one
is
beaten
by
an
instrument
there
is
a
right
to
hearing.
i
must
add
that
i’m
limiting
this
case
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
this
case
deals
with
an
instrument,
it
doesn’t
deals
with
karate
chops,
it
doesn’t
involve
that
kind
of
situation.
let’s
go
with
the
limitation
you
are
making
on
the
hands
would
like
to
be
gently
slapped
by
mohammad
ali?
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no
i
would
not
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
punishment,
yes,
down
under
the
color
of
state
law.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
certainly
because
the
eighth
amendment
argument
is
severe
and
excessive
punishment,
the
14th
amendment
due
process
argument
is
punishment
which
is
the
punishment
which
is
permissible,
even
under
florida
law,
corporal
punishment.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
it
would,
and
let
me
say
this,
under
the
florida
law
the
statute
in
the
school
board
regulations
they
already
require
some
consultation
with
the
principal,
prior
to
administration
of
corporal
punishment,
that
kind
of
corporal
punishment.
so,
the
hearing
that
we
are
asking
for
would
not
be
any
intrusion
really
into
the
public
school
workings
on
a
daily
basis,
we
submit
that
there
must
be
a
minimal
opportunity
for
a
hearing,
something
similar
to
goss
versus
lopez
and
there
must
be
decision
is
to
whether
or
not
the
punishment
should
be
administered
by
a
neutral
and
detached
person.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
absolutely
precluding
eighth
amendment
and
fourteenth
amendment
relieve,
it
seems
to
us
goes
much
too
far.
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
tomorrow
morning
and
rebuttal.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
do
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
understand
mr.
howard’s
argument,
it
boils
down
to
the
fact
that
the
constitution
can
ban
the
flogging
of
prisoners
but
it
cannot
ban
the
flogging
of
students.
we
do
not
think
that..
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
and
so
am
i
at
this
point,
mr.
justice
white
and
i
want
to
reiterate
to
the
court
that
there
are
two
separate
and
distinct
issues
in
this
case.
in
the
eighth
amendment
context,
the
argument
is
that
this
punishment
is
civil
in
nature
and
not
criminal
and,
therefore
some
distinction
can
be
drawn
on
that
basis,
so,
it
is
merely
a
label
of
convenience.
the
factor
to
be
looked
at
is
whether
or
not
it
is
punishment,
irrespective
of
who
is
meeting
out
that
punishment.
in
trop
v.
dulles
and
perez
v.
brownell,
when
one
reads
them,
i
think
one
sees
that
the
focus
is
upon
punishment.
not
punishment
for
a
crime
but
whether
or
not
there
was
punishment
involved
and
the
court
found
in
perez
that
stripping
a
person
of
his
nationality
was
not
punishment.
what
it
was,
was
an
exercise
of
international
affairs
power
of
congress
saying
that
if
someone
voted
in
a
foreign
election
then,
because
we
had
to
show
the
foreign
country,
that
we
were
not
interfering
in
their
business,
we
would
strip
a
person
of
his
nationality
but
it
was
not
at
all
looking
at
that
as
punishment.
in
trop,
it
was
punishment
and
so
the
focus
is
upon
punishment,
i
think
that
is
important.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
i
do
not
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
mr.
justice
stewart,
at
the
way,
i
read
it,
when
one
reads
perez
carefully,
one
notes
that
the
original
law
which
stripped
a
person
of
his
nationality,
which
was
a
civil
law
--
a
civil
war
involved
no
desertion,
conviction
at
all.
the
historical
basis
for
trop
and
perez
was
an
old
statute
that
said,
“if
you
served
or
if
you
are
deserted,
whether
you
are
convicted
or
not,
you
would
be
stripped
of
your
nationality.”
i
think
the
focus
is
upon
punishment.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
because...
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
because
in
perez,
it
was
not
punishment
because
congress
was
exercising
a
specific
power
that
it
had,
not
to
punish
a
person
but
to
protect
the
country
and
i
think,
when
one
reads
perez
carefully,
that
that
is
a
conclusion
that
one
comes
to,
that
is
the
basis
for
the
distinction.
i
do
not
think
it
make
very
much
difference
to
our
case,
quite
frankly.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
if
it
is
an
illegitimate
exercise
of
that
power
which
it
was
in
perez
and
there
was
a
legitimate
governmental
interest
that
was
being
protected
and
the
court
found
that
in
perez.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
i
am
not
saying
that
is
not
the
case
but
i
am
saying
that
the
first
question
that
must
be
addressed
is
whether
or
not
the
intent
of
congress
in
inflicting
some
kind
of
a
sanction
upon
a
person
is
to
punish.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
where
we
disagree
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that,
i
do
not
think
that
the
criminal
aspect
is
important,
the
punishment
aspect
is
important
but
as
i
say,
trop
and
perez
are
not
essential
to
our
case
at
all
because
we
come
down
to...
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
any
rule
in
what,
in
the
foreign
country
or
in
this
court...
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
i
do
not
think,
i
do
not
think
there
was...
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
it
did.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
all,
i
am
saying
is
the
focus
is
punishment
and
must
is
a
punishment,
if
it
is
punishment,
no
matter
who
meets
it
out,
it
can
violate
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
and,
that
is
exactly
what
happened
in
this
situation,
there
are
breach
in
the
official
rules
and
then
punishment
is
imposed.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
and
we
have
never
said
that
one
whack
is
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment.
the
question
is
whether
or
not,
there
is
some
opportunity
for
hearing
before
authorized
punishment
can
be
imposed.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
would
say
there
should
be
an
opportunity
for
hearing
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
because..
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no
sir,
it
is
not
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
is
the
excessive
and
severe
and
brutal
nature
of
the
punishment
which
is
imposed.
i
have
said
that
we
are
seeking
to
outlaw
under
eighth
amendment
concepts,
corporal
punishment.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
first,
one
looks
at
punishment.
if
the
punishment
is
excessive
or
severe,
the
eighth
amendment
may
come
in
to
play,
that
is
our
eight
amendment
argument.
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
context,
one
looks
at
punishment
again.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
due
process
argument.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
certainly,
if
there
is
punishment
that
is
to
be
imposed,
what
we
are
saying
is
that
there
must
be
an
opportunity
for
hearing
prior
to
the
imposition
of
that
punishment
because
there
is
both
a
liberty
interest
which
i
talked
about
yesterday
and
a
property
interest
which
i
want
to
be
very
clear
on,
is
also
involved
here.
james
ingram
was
driven
from
that
school
by
the
panel
for
over
a
week,
had
he
been
suspended
for
over
a
week,
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
hearing
under
goss
v.
lopez.
he
was
in
effect,
suspended
by
the
panel,
so
we
have
a
property
interest
that
is
involved
in
addition
to
a
liberty
interest.
one
of
the
argument
that
has
been
raised..
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
another
argument
that
has
been
raised
here
is
that
these
are
matters
that
should
be
left
to
the
public
schools.
we
give
wide
latitude
to
the
public
schools
in
our
argument,
but,
there
come
moments
when
arbitrary
decisions
by
governmental
officers
bring
the
constitution
into
play.
here
the
due
process
hearings
that
we
ask
serve
as
a
protection.
it
provides
rule
by
law
and
not
rule
by
fear,
protection
of
individual
against
arbitrary
action
by
the
government.
these
did
not
occur,
these
kinds
of
protections
did
not
occur
in
this
case.
there
was
no
consultation
with
the
principal
and
every
if
they
were
consultations
with
the
principal
under
florida
law,
there
is
no
opportunity
to
be
heard
prior
to
the
infliction
of
any
corporal
punishment
and,
we
are
saying
that
there
are
severe
deprivations
that
are
involved
and
therefore
there
must
be
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
certainly
is
innovation
upon
one's
privacy
and
freedom,
not
to
be,
to
have
one's
bodily
integrity
invaded
by
the
government.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
not
to
be
whacked.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
might
afford
equally
adequate
relief
but
monroe
v.
pape
says
that
is
not
the
test.
if
there
is..
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
would
be
available
at
florida
courts.
children
do
not
lose
their
rights.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
not
the
state
equivalent,
the
school
board
can
be
sued,
individual,
teacher
could
be
sued.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
but
this
case
cannot
turn
on
that
issue.
if
for
instance,
a
prisoner
were
beaten
and
everyone
can
see
that
that
prisoner
has
the
right
to
hearing
if
he
is
being
punished
by
a
100
whacks
with
a
strap,
a
100
blows
with
a
strap,
he
could
sue
in
state
court
or
federal
court.
if
there
is
an
excessive
and
severe
punishment
that
violates
a
constitutional
right,
both
courts
are
equally
open,
monroe
v.
pape.
children
does
not
lose
their
rights
at
the
school
house
door,
that
was
the
effect
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
it
went
much
too
far.
we
submit
that
when
children
are
in
school,
they
are
in
custody
of
school
authorities,
of
people
acting
under
color
of
state
law
and
those
persons
are
bound
by
the
constitution.
and,
for
those
reasons
that
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed.
