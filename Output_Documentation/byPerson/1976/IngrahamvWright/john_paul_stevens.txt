mr.
howard,
can
i
interrupt?
i
cannot
remember
whether
yesterday,
you
answered
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question
about
two
persons
in
the
same
institution.
one,
there
is
resolved
of
conviction
for
crime
and
the
other
is
finding
of
mental
illness,
and
the
same
punishment
being
meted
out
to
both,
it
was
if
your
answer,
that
one
would
have
eighth
amendment
claim
and
the
other
would
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
your
analysis
be
the
same
if
both
of
them,
if
the
person
inflicting
the
discipline,
said
in
words,
this
is
punishment
and
was
doing
what
was
in
effect,
punishing
the
man
for
a
kind
of
both
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
was
wondering
if
one
could
reconcile
the
case
as
you
described
about
the
loss
of
citizenship,
by
simply
saying
that
one
case
it
was
punishment
and
the
other
case,
it
was
not,
rather
than
saying
in
one
case
there
was
a
criminal
process
and
the
other
was
not.
wouldn’t
the
opinions
be
consistent
with
that
rather
simple
approach,
or
is
any
language
in
the
opinions,
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
that
rather
simple
approach?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
couldn't
one
just
simply
say
punishment,
and
forget
it
as
a
consequence
of
crime,
wouldn’t
the
same
distinction
apply?
that
is
really
my
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
in
the
loss
of
citizenship
situation,
it
clearly
was,
i
mean,
in
the
consequence
of
wartime
desertion,
it
was
clearly
punishment.
it
seemed
to
me,
if
that
had
been
done
by
executive
order
or
by
some
other
procedure,
other
than
it,
results
a
crime,
one
could
consistently
with
the
opinion
still
call
it
punishment
covered
by
eight
amendment.
i
am
not
quite
sure
why
one
could
not
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
is
my
point,
the
opinion
does
not
articulate
the
rationale
what
you
find
in
the
opinion.
