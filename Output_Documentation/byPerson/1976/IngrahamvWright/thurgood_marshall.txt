mr.
rogow
you
admit
that
during
the
time
of
adoption
of
eighth
amendment
corporal
punishment
was
the
order
of
the
day.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
made
it
a
criminal
by
whipping
with
the
stick.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
take
position
that
all
corporal
punishments
and
violations?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
why
are
you
arguing
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
any
one
person
thinks
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
any
five
think
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
what
you
think
liberty
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
have
to
pinpoint?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
the
eighth
amendment
go
backwards
as
well
as
forwards,
if
something
is
a
cruel
unusual
punishment
ten
years
ago,
if
evidence
shows
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
need
for
it
and
the
need
cannot
be
met
in
another
ways
could
have
done
something
become
not
cruel
and
unusual?
justice
thurgood
marshall
professor
what
did
you
do
about
the
local
(inaudible),
is
it
gone?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don’t
think
you
should
limit
it,
if
you
want
to
go
there
ahead?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
at
time
this
record
as
i
have
read
it
was
little
bit
horrible
and
it
stands
uncontradicted
because
of
case
in
the
law
and
it
is
(inaudible)
for
me
to
do
but
they
view
it
that
that
is
possible
under
florida
law.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
takes
the
little
fellow
hand
i
think
some
had
this
hand.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
at
that
time
that
teaches
could
do
what
ever
he
you
want?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
the
restriction…?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
no
hearing,
there
is
no
nothing,
i
gave
you
all
the
facts.
the
principal
says,
“you
have
been
late,
you
have
been
late
too
many
times
and
you
deserve
punishment,
i
am
going
to
punish
you,
give
me
the
rule,
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
per
that,
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
difference
between
that
and
this
case
is...
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
punishment
was
the
key.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
the
fourteenth
amendments
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
here?
