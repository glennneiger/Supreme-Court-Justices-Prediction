unknown
speaker
mr.
rogow
you
were
here
this
morning,
weren't
you
doing
the
argument
of
the
fight
in
the
columbus
bar
case.
unknown
speaker
you
have
heard
some
of
the
questioning
there
supposing
the
policemen
in
that
case
had
simply
pistol-whipped
with
one
of
the
plaintiffs
there,
would
you
say
that
could
be
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
the
issue
of
the
hearing?
unknown
speaker
and
also
even
if
he
did,
whether
or
not
corporal
punishment…
unknown
speaker
it's
among
the
per-numbers.
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
concept
of
custody
that
offends
your
definition
of
punishment
under
the
eighth
amendment
as
must
the
person
inflicting
the
punishment
presumably
on
behalf
of
the
government
have
the
person
is
some
sort
of
custody
where
in
affect
he
can't
get
away.
unknown
speaker
but
surely
it
is
not
necessary
to
your
analysis.
unknown
speaker
what
if
one
superior
in
the
local
government
office
simply
pistol-whipped
so
they
would
be
cruel
and
unusual
if
performed
by
a
jailor
on
an
inmate,
would
that
be
a
cruel
unusual
punishment?
unknown
speaker
in
one
of
our
conferences,
one
of
those
hit
the
other
in
the
nose.
unknown
speaker
agents
of
the
federal
government
run
federal
business.
unknown
speaker
the
authority
is
to
conform
sometimes
the
conference
is
going
to
get
quite
heated.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rogow
you
ask
for
damages
and
your
complaint,
this
is
the
forwarded
case
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
possibility;
are
there
other
tort
remedies
under
florida
law
for
this
kind
of
thing?
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
to
slap?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
a
slap
will
not
be
an
instrument,
which
will
invoke
the
procedural
atrocity.
unknown
speaker
or
a
karate
chop
would
not
be?
unknown
speaker
five
slaps
with
a
ruler
on
the
hand,
it
still
require
a
hearing
before
it
could
be
administered?
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
another
step
or
would
it
be
the
same
step
applied
to
a
different
context?
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
very
short
time
as
a
disciplinary
measure,
but
if
any
corporal
punishment.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
first
--
you
are
dealing
i
suppose,
if
i
understand
you,
with
the
procedural
due
process
aspect
of
this
play,
of
this
case
but
neither
goss
or
strickland
involved
on
the
eighth
amendment
issue
at
all.
unknown
speaker
mr.
howard
state
or
federal
in
florida
had
any
restrictions
on
corporal
punishment
in
the
school
system?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
punishment?
there
were
no
restriction
on
the
punishment
could
he
be
paddle
125
times?
unknown
speaker
mr.
howard
suppose
there
were
two
inmates
in
a
mental
institution,
one
was
there
because
of
the
criminal
commitment,
the
other
one
was
there
because
of
the
civil
commitment
in
the
same
institution.
would
the
eighth
amendment
apply
to
one
not
to
the
other?
unknown
speaker
but
it
followed
a
court
marshall
conviction
for
a
criminal
offense,
didn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
not
only
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
howard
on
your
two
men
in
the
mental
institution,
how
do
you
get
around
the
screws
case?
unknown
speaker
they
were
both
--
both
of
them
are
incarcerated.
unknown
speaker
a
confident,
civilly
committed
man
and
say,
“you
did
some
wrong,
you
spit
on
the
floor
and
so
i
am
going
deny
you,
your
rights
and
i
am
going
to
beat
daylights
out
of
you,
punish
you.”
unknown
speaker
did
i
not
screw?
unknown
speaker
you
said,
it
is
only
not
fairly
a
violation
of
eighth
amendment,
you
are
not
saying
it
could
be
a
violation.
unknown
speaker
but
your
point,
as
i
understand
it
is,
the
screws
case
involved
a
deprivation
of
life
without
due
process
of
law
and
did
not
involve
the
eighth
amendment
as
said.
unknown
speaker
it
fairly
expert
who
argue
the
screws
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
howard
could
i
interrupt
again,
it
seems
to
me,
we
may
just
be
arguing
what
constitutional
basis
there
would
be
for
the
kind
of
review
the
plaintiff
seeks
in
this
case,
because,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
you
are
saying
that
if
the
student
is
given
a
fair
hearing,
say,
they
have
a
full
trial
on
whatever
the
charge
against
him
is
and
a
fair
procedure
to
determine
his
guilt.
and,
then
as
a
result
of
that
they
impose
a
punishment
so,
they
decide
this
offence
justifies
locking
him
in
the
basement
for
four
days
or
something,
in
the
basement
of
the
school
without
bread
or
water
or
anything.
i
think,
you
are
saying
as
a
matter
of
substantive
due
process,
that
would
be
intolerable
even
though
it
might
not
violate
the
eighth
amendment
and,
if
so,
what
difference
does
it
really
make?
(inaudible)
is
going
to
be
one
of
it
and
such
an
extremely
severe
penalty
as
related
to
the
offence,
that
it
is
not
constitutionally
tolerable.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
am
assuming,
we
give
the
procedural
due
process
to
get
that
aspect
out
of
the
questions
that
is
all.
unknown
speaker
then
say
you
locked
a
5-year-old
or
7-year-old
boy
in
the
basement
for
ten
days.
could
a
school
do
that,
provided
you
gave
him
an
adequate
hearing,
would
the
constitution
tolerate
that?
i
think
your
position
is
either
yes
or
it
has
to
be
under
some
provision
other
than
the
eighth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
acknowledge
the
state
right
to
do
that
and
yet
question
the
hypothetical
case
about
the
inmate
in
a
mental
institution
who
has
given
unusually
severe
discipline?
what
is
the
difference
in
constitutional
terms?
unknown
speaker
do
you
prefer
to
have
us
find
it
a
matter
of
substantive
due
process
rather
than
apply
the
eight
amendment?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
the
very
issue
here?
whether
no
matter
how
severe
the
punishment,
there
is
any
constitutional
remedy
based
on
the
facts
alleged
here.
maybe
he
has
proceeded
under
the
wrong
theory
but
do
you
still
deny
him
any
relief?
unknown
speaker
which
do
not
affect
litigants’
constitutional
rights
but
here
i
am
troubled
by
the
problem,
and
see
the
underlying
problem
here
is
whether
the
constitution
protects
an
individual
from
being
in
prison
indefinitely
by
a
school.
if
that
is
the
course,
the
school
chooses
to
punish.
unknown
speaker
here
there
was
no
imprisonment.
there
was
no
deprivation
of
liberty,
was
it
there?
unknown
speaker
no,
but,
in
principle
it
is
the
same
thing,
at
least...
unknown
speaker
no,
but
not
in
the
constitution
which
--
under
the
fourteenth
and
the
fifteenth
amendment
talks
about
life,
liberty
or
property,
and,
here
there
was
no
deprivation
of
--
unknown
speaker
but
the
point
would
be,
the
only
constitutional
protection
against
the
deprivation
of
liberty
is
to
have
the
procedural
due
process
preceded.
and,
i
am
assuming
that
the
deprivation
of
liberty
that
i
described
was
made
only
after
a
fair
and
full
trial
as
retaining
guilt.
the
question
is,
is
there
any
limit
on
the
punishment
the
state
can
impose
on
the
student
for
as
in
correction
of
the
school
rule
and
i
found
in
your
position
is,
there
is
no
limit
unless
it
is
substantive
to
some
kind
of
substantive
due
process.
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
the
problem
with
the
fifth
circuit
opinion?
we
do
not
have
to
review
every
time
a
student
gets
slapped
in
order
to
avoid
the
constitutional
extreme
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
reached,
that
is
the
only
suggestion
i
am
making.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
question
was
presented
at
the
petition,
was
it
not
and
service
was
not
granted
on
that
issue.
unknown
speaker
the
limit
of
the
grant
is
questions
one
and
two?
unknown
speaker
whereas,
we
are
along
the
line
is
that
the
teacher
struck
this
child
up
on
the
street.
that
would
be
assault
and
battery,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but,
maybe
because
it
is
in
the
school
that
it
takes
it
out
of
the
assault
and
battery.
unknown
speaker
that
assault
matter
is
obviously
the
state,
it
is
not
a
federal.
unknown
speaker
he
was
arguing
that
--
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
congress
says,
we
exercised
an
interstate
commerce
power
here
and
that
we
are
going
to
do
this
too,
does
that
make
it
not
punishment,
if
congress
is
exercising
a
specific
power?
unknown
speaker
but,
i
thought
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause
was
a
barrier
to
what
would
otherwise
be
a
quite
sweeping
exercise
of
congressional
power,
that
you
have
the
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce,
almost
anyway
you
want
to,
except
when
you
run
against
specific
prohibition,
the
bill
of
right,
or
are
you
saying
that
that
is
not
the
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rogow,
in
perez,
was
there
any
rule
against
voting
in
a
foreign
election?
unknown
speaker
no,
here.
unknown
speaker
there
was
a
consequence
that
was
imposed
but
you
violated
no
law
in
voting
them.
unknown
speaker
but
you
did
by
deserting?
unknown
speaker
and
in
trop,
the
suction
of
expatriation
followed
only
upon
conviction
of
a
criminal
offence.
i
am
not
talking
about
its
predecessor
in
the
civil
war,
i
am
talking
about
the
law
involved
in
trop,
isn't
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
not
upon
the
fact
of
desertion.
unknown
speaker
but
upon
a
conviction
of
a
criminal
offence.
unknown
speaker
isn't
there
some
substance
in
arguing
and
making
you
punishment
argument
that
whatever
happens
to
him
follows
upon
the
breach
--
supposedly
follows
upon
a
breach
of
rule,
of
an
official
rule.
unknown
speaker
what
happens
if
the
principal
tells
the
teacher,
"you
have
been
late
three
days
this
week,
give
me
a
rule
and
i
will
walk
you
out",
is
that
a
violation
of
eighth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
but,
it
did
not
have
the
property
interest
involved
in
every
case
in
which
you
contend
procedural
due
process
is
required.
unknown
speaker
as
most
cases
would
not
involve
school
absence?
unknown
speaker
well,
judging
by
your
answer
to
justice
marshall's
question,
a
severe
deprivation
would
not
be
necessary.
if
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
before
he
has
one
whack
with
the
ruler.
unknown
speaker
i
am
saying
that
in
a
fourteenth
amendment
context,
that
is
a
deprivation
of
liberty
because
it
involves
an
intrusion,
a
bodily
intrusion,
the
deprivation
of
privacy,
the
result
and
as
the
district
court
judge
found
psychological
harm,
stigma,
ridicule,
all
of
that
and
the
facts
of
this
case
support
that.
unknown
speaker
but,
one
whack
with
the
ruler
is
a
deprivation
of
privacy?
unknown
speaker
not
to
be
whacked.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rogow,
i
think
you
agreed
yesterday
that
that
would
be
tort
action
on
the
florida
law
against
the
principal
and
teacher
involved.
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
that
would
not
afford
equally
and
adequate
relief
to
the
individuals
and
questions?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
i
was
asking
whether
or
not
the
florida
courts,
if
recourse
had
been
sought
that
out,
would
not
have
afforded
adequate
relief.
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
state
equivalent
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
in
florida?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
any
other
course
under
the
florida
law.
