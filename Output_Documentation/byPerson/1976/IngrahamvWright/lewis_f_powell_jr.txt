justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
presents
questions
concerning
the
use
of
corporal
punishment
in
the
public
schools.
petitioners
were
junior
high
school
students
in
dade
county
florida.
they
brought
this
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
against
school
officials
alleging
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights
and
seeking
damages
and
injunctive
relief.
at
trial,
petitioner's
evidence
indicated
that
they
were
severely
paddled
for
relatively
minor
infractions
of
rules.
one
of
the
petitioners
were
subjected
to
more
than
20
licks
resulting
in
serious
bruising
and
absence
from
school
for
11
days.
florida
law
in
keeping
with
the
common
law
authorizes
reasonable
corporate
punishment
as
a
means
of
maintaining
discipline
but
such
punishment
may
not
be
degrading
or
unduly
severe
and
may
not
be
inflicted
or
maybe
inflicted
only
after
prior
consultation
with
the
school
officials.
although
the
evidence
offered
by
petitioners
was
indicated
are
violations
of
florida
law,
the
district
court
found
no
violation
of
federal
constitutional
right.
the
suit
was
dismissed
without
hearing
evidence
from
the
school
authorities.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
and
we
granted
certiorari.
petitioners
alleged
two
violations
of
constitutional
rights.
they
first
assert
with
the
eighth
amendment's
prohibition
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
applies
to
school
punishment
as
well
as
to
that
imposed
under
the
criminal
law.
the
use
of
corporal
punishment
to
discipline
school
children
dates
back
to
colonial
times.
the
law
was
then
well
settled
but
teachers
had
this
right
so
long
as
excessive
force
was
not
used.
the
founding
fathers
were
familiar
with
this
practice
and
with
common
laws.
nor
has
a
law
been
changed
in
187
years
since
the
adoption
of
the
eighth
amendment,
23
states
have
addressed
this
issue
through
legislation,
21
have
reaffirmed
the
substance
of
the
common
law
rule.
only
two
states
have
prohibited
physical
punishment
in
the
public
schools.
in
some,
we
find
no
basis
for
wrenching
the
eighth
amendment
from
its
historical
context
and
extending
it
to
school
discipline.
petitioners
further
contend
that
they
were
entitled
by
virtue
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
a
hearing
before
being
paddled.
we
agreed
with
petitioners
that
are
protected
liberty
interest
is
implicated
when
school
authorities
restrain
a
pupil
and
inflict
appreciable
physical
pain.
but
the
possible
violation
of
a
constitutional
right
does
not
always
require
a
prior
hearing.
the
basic
question
is
whether
other
remedies
long
available
or
adequate
to
provide
reasonable
protection
of
the
right.
the
remedies
here
are
substantial.
the
common
law
allows
the
pupil
to
recover
damages
from
a
teacher
who
imposes
excessive
punishment.
florida
statutes
also
imposed
both
criminal
and
civil
liabilities.
moreover,
in
the
openness
of
a
public
school
with
a
restraining
presence
of
pupils
and
other
teachers,
the
risk
of
excessive
punishment
is
slight.
indeed,
the
evidence
in
this
case
indicated
that
the
punishment
inflicted
on
petitioners
was
quite
unusual.
common
sense
as
well
as
long
experience
tells
us
that
the
risk
of
abuse
of
this
traditional
disciplinary
measure
is
minimal
and
when
abused,
the
consequences
for
the
offending
teachers
can
be
serious
indeed.
we
found
therefore,
no
basis
in
the
constitution
for
commanding
a
prior
hearing.
the
remedy
is
already
available
have
been
accepted
as
adequate
to
protect
children
since
the
founding
of
this
country.
we
decline
at
this
late
date
and
at
a
time
when
serious
problems
be
set
out
of
schools
to
impose
an
unnecessary
restriction
on
all
school
teachers
simply
because
a
misconduct
of
a
few
in
one
school
in
florida.
we
therefore
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
joined
by
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
justice
stevens
also
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
