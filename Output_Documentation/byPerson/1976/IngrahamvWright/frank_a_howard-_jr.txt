mr.
frank
a.
howard
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
is
being
asked
in
this
case
to
take
two
long
further
steps
into
still
another
area
of
school
discipline,
public
school
discipline.
the
court
has
been
asked
to
expand
the
bounds
of
the
eighth
amendment,
as
we
have
understood
at
least
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
to
provide
federal
actions,
whenever
a
student
or
a
student’s
parents
perceives
that
a
punishment
has
been
immoderate
or
unacceptable
to
the
student
or
the
parent.
secondly
the
court
has
been
asked
to
mandate
constitutional
due
process
procedures
in
every
case
of
corporal
punishment
by
extension
of
the
rule
that
the
court
adopted
in
goss
versus
lopez,
providing
for
due
process
in
suspension
cases
up
to
ten
days.
we
see
the
case
as
an
opportunity,
first
for
the
court
to
clarify
and
reaffirm
the
scope
of
the
eighth
amendment
as
been
limited
to
punishments
inflicted
either
as
a
consequence
of
or
collateral
to
the
criminal
process
and
secondly
if
not
to
overrule,
goss
versus
lopez
at
least
to
confine
it
within
it’s
rationale
and
not
to
open
that
rule
to
threaten
the
discretion
of
educators
and
still
more
and
more
and
more
day
to
day
decisions
which
are
been
made
throughout
the
nation
in
the
schools.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
well
i
would.
see
the
wood
versus
strickland
case
as
an
additional
reason
for
the
court
not
to
take
yet
another
step
in
the
due
process
procedural
field
because
mr.
frank
a.
howard
i
think
it
would
be
an
another
step,
mr.
chief
justice
i'm
not
recalling
the
specific
facts
of
wood
versus
strickland
now
as
i
recall
it,
it
was
a
suspension
case,
this
is
a…
mr.
frank
a.
howard
i
am
urging
the
court
to
accept
the
view
that
corporal
punishment
is
a
lesser
order
of
discipline
even
than
suspensions.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
that
is
true
sir,
but
i
agree
with
counsel
that
we
had
a
too
separate
decision.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
at
the
time
the
case
arose
mr.
justice
the
statue
in
florida
was
a
very
short
section
which
by
negative
implication,
authorized
corporal
punished
in
the
defining
the
authority
of
the
teacher.
since
that
time
in
fact
just
this
year
state
legislature
has
enacted
a
fairly
comprehensive,
set
of
laws
dealing
with
student
conduct
and
it
now
extensively
defines
corporal
punishment
and
provides
procedures
for
how
it
is
to
be
administered.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
i
could
disagree
mr.
justice
respectfully
that,
with
your
characterization
of
the
record
i
disagree.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
well,
mr.
justice
in
considering
the
phrase
under
any
definition
cruel
unusual.
we
have
in
this
case
–
i
submit
a
few
incidents
of
immoderate
and
even
severe
if
you
will
punishment.
but
in
the
context
of
what
the
case
sort
to
establish
and
the
size
and
variety
of
the
school
system
and
the
fact
most
of
the
punishments
which
the
record
reflect
were
trivials.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
evidence
did
not
come
anywhere
near
showing
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
however
you
may
choose
to
define
that
and...
mr.
frank
a.
howard
no
sir
he
could
not
under
the…
mr.
frank
a.
howard
well
there
was
a
dade
county
school
board
policy
ineffective
of
the
time
which
provided
that
a
teacher
must
himself
with
the
principal
before
corporal
punishment
could
be
administrated.
that
punishment
should
take
place
in
the
presence
of
another
adult.
student
should
be
informed
of
the
reasons
for
the
punishment
and
what
the
misconduct
was.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
there
were
no
explicit
restrictions
except
statements
that
it
must
be
--
it
must
not
exceed
reasonable
moderate
bounds
which
has
been
the
common
law
definition
i
understand
it.
the
best
test
of
the
record
i
might
say
mr.
justice
is
the
district
judge
who
is
the
man,
the
court
most
of
the
position
to
assess
the
facts,
dismiss
this
case
at
the
close
of
the
plaintiff’s
evidence
and
use
the
plaintiff’s
test,
he
accepted
the
standards
of
the
eighth
amendment
did
apply
and
found
that
the
facts
did
not
rise
to
that
level.
coming
then
to
the
eighth
amendment
issue,
the
issue
as
we
see
it
is
simply
whether
or
not
the
amendments
applies
at
all.
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case,
the
en
banc
court
held
that
it
did
not
and
gave
some
careful
analysis
to
the
history
and
the
rationality
of
the
amendment.
one
circuit
disagrees
the
eighth
circuit
has
held
in
a
case
that
went
only
on
the
pleadings
that
the
eighth
amendment
can
apply
there
was
no
analysis,
no
reasoning
to
support
the
conclusion.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
mr.
justice
i
am
aware
of
the
jackson
versus
bishop
case
of
course,
i
would
say
first
with
respect
that
this
court
has
never
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
punishments
even
to
prisoners
violates
the
eighth
amendment.
now
i
must
say
that
i
don’t
have
a
lot
of
doubt
what
the
outcome
that
is
might
be.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
court
recessed
yesterday,
i
was
attempting
to
answer
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question
which
i
understood
to
be
whether
civilly
committed
institutional
inmates
were
within
the
reach
of
the
eighth
amendment.
i
would
like
to
try
to
arrive
at
the
answer
by
explaining
our
theory
of
the
reach
of
the
eighth
amendment,
and
why
under
that
theory
derived
from
this
court’s
decisions,
my
answer
to
the
question
would
have
to
be
no.
this
court’s
decisions
have
never,
in
my
reading,
departed
from
the
historic
intent
or
the
literal
tax
to
the
amendment
which
is
internally
consistent.
it
speaks
of
excessive
fines,
excessive
bails,
and
cruel
and
unusual
punishments.
the
amendment,
as
we
read
the
court’s
decisions,
only
speaks
to
punishments
which
are
inflected
consequential
to
or
collateral
to
the
criminal
process
of
law.
corporal
punishment
in
the
schools,
in
our
view
is
no
part
of
the
criminal
process
by
any
view.
it
is
civil
and
correctional
therapeutic
in
nature.
it
is
not
within
the
criminal
concepts
at
all.
the
history
of
the
eight
amendment
has
been
explained
too
often
for
me
to
try
to
bore
the
court
with
it.
it
originated
from
the
imposition
of
inhumane
sentences
by
the
english
courts.
its
interpretation
by
this
court’s
decisions,
as
uniformly
have
been
in
the
criminal
context.
in
fact,
the
court
has
rejected
his
application
in
civil
cases,
in
such
cases
as
the
deportation,
the
fong
yue
ting
case,
and
in
a
case
involving
incarceration
for
civil
contempt.
this
court
has
rejected
the
eight
amendment
as
applicable
there
to
give
relief.
the
clearest
illustration,
we
believe
is
in
the
case
which
is
heavily
relied
upon
by
the
petitioners
and
that
is
trop
v.
dulles.
the
distinction
can
be
seen
by
comparing
trop
with
its
companion
case
which
was
decided
by
this
court
on
the
same
day
in
1958,
perez
v.
brownell.
the
nationality
act
of
1940
in
perez,
stripped
mr.
perez
of
his
citizenship
because
he
voted
in
a
foreign
election.
there
was
no
criminal
conviction,
there
was
no
criminal
process.
the
court
sustain
that
denationalization.
in
trop,
mr.
trop
had
been
found
guilty
by
court
marshall
at
wartime
desertion
and
the
statute
there
imposed
denationalization
as
a
consequence
of
that
conviction.
chief
justice
warren
in
the
opinion,
as
we
read
the
opinion,
only
came
to
the
question
of
the
eight
amendment,
after
finding
that
there
was
a
conviction.
the
eight
amendment
was
invoked
by
that
criminal
consequence.
he
then
preceded
to
the
famous
language
about
penal
and
the
distinction
between
penal
and
non-penal
statutes,
that
the
government
cannot
label
something
non-penal,
when
it
is
really
penal.
in
our
view,
that
is
a
secondary
test,
the
threshold
test
is
always
whether
there
is
a
criminal
process
in
link
or
nexus.
if
there
is
found
such
a
connection
then
the
question
is
whether
the
punishment
is
penal
and
if
it
found
to
be
penal
then
the
question
is,
is
it
cruel
and
unusual
and,
the
court
has
certainly
expanded
the
definition
of
the
term
cruel
and
unusual
but
we
submit
that
it
has
never
expanded
the
basic
definition
of
punishment.
so,
unless
there
is
punishment
in
the
eight
amendment
sentence,
the
amendment
does
not
apply
and
that
brings
me
to
the
cases
in
the
lower
courts
which
have
departed
from
this
standard
that
i
am
suggesting.
the
prison
cases
are
the
best
example
and
the
most
famous
prison
case
is
that
decision
written
by
mr.
justice
blackmun,
while
on
the
court
of
appeals,
jackson
v.
bishop
in
which
the
flogging
of
prisoners
in
arkansas
penitentiaries
was
prohibited
as
violated
the
eight
amendment.
other
cases
have
applied
it
into
juvenile
institutions,
the
nelson
v.
heyne
in
the
seventh
circuit,
dealt
with
a
juvenile
institution
where
there
criminal
and
non-criminal
youngsters
in
the
institution
but
it
gave
no
analysis
to
what
we
see
to
be
the
threshold
issue.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
yes
sir,
i
was
really
trying
in
a
long
way
to
get
that
answer
now
by
explaining
our
theory.
my
answer
would
be
yes,
that
under
rigorous
analysis
of
this
court’s
decisions,
the
civilly
committed
mental
patient
would
not
have
benefit
of
the
eight
amendment.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
i
think
i
would
be
the
same
mr.
justice.
again,
i
see
it
as
a
question
of
contours
of
the
eighth
amendment
and
what
i
see
to
be
a
blurring
of
those
contours
by
lower
court
treatment,
so
far
which
has
not
examined
this
problem.
most
of
the
cases
involving
mixed
institutional
custody
have
not
stated
why
the
eight
amendment
is
invoked.
they
have
assumed
that
it
has
been
invoked.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
well,
i
have
am
find
it
difficult
to
see
the
analogy,
mr.
justice
stevens
because
in
the
perez
and
trop
cases,
the
end
result
was
exactly
the
same
and
the
only
distinction
that
i
can
see
between
taking
away
--
restoring
mr.
trop’s
citizenship
when
he
was
convicted
of
wartime
desertion
and
taking
away
from
mr.
perez
when
he
voted
in
a
foreign
election
was
the
chief
justice’s
lead
in
the
opinion
by
discussing
punishment
as
a
consequence
of
crime.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
no,
sir.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
yes,
it
is
clearly
did.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
and,
i
believe
that
was
chief
justice
warren’s
basis
for
reaching
the
eighth
amendment.
he
did
not
articulate
the
reasoning
that
i
am
urging
to
the
court.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
not
in
so
many
words
but
i
think,
the
rationale
is
there
and
has
to
be
recognized.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
sir,
i.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
no
sir,
i
would
not
accept
that.
i
would
say
that
it
is
--
mr.
frank
a.
howard
mr.
justice,
i..
mr.
frank
a.
howard
no,
i
do
not
think
they
are
the
same.
i
think
that
the
courts
have
had
a
solicitor
for
institutional
cases
and
it
is
perfectly
understandable
when
a
man’s
or
a
child’s
liberty
is
taken
away
from
him
and
he
is
put
in
into
an
institution
and
he
is
isolated
from
the
community.
and,
he
cannot
go
home
to
his
parents
at
night
and
he
is
subjected
to
inhumane
conditions
in
that
institution,
then
the
courts
have
found
that
the
conditions
demand
a
remedy.”
i
would
suggest
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
be
more
appropriate
as
a
remedy
in
those
situations
in
the
eight
amendment.
and,
a
few
courts
have
drawn
that
distinction
between
the
prisoners
either
in
jail
or
in
a
reformatory
as
a
result
of
a
criminal
act
and
inmates
there,
either
because
of
mental
incompetence
or
because
they
are
pre-trial
detainees,
it
seems
to
me
that
for
a
detainee
or
a
mental
patient
to
suffer
inhumane
treatment
or
conditions
is
so
irrationally
and
so
unrelated
to
a
state
objective
that
he
could
challenge
that
treatment
based
on
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
i
am
not
saying
that
there
could
not
be
a
remedy
and
of
course,
if
we
take
it
to
this
case,
that
is
the
issue
that
is
not
before
the
court
today.
there
was
a
third
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
which
would
have
brought
a
substitute
for
due
process
issue
here.
and,
the
court
did
not
accept
that
and
of
course,
neither
of
us
have
briefed
it
and
i
would
not
want
to
make
any
concessions
on
it
but
that
is
a
possibility.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
the
screws
case,
of
course,
was
a
criminal
case
and
it
required
specific
intent
but
i
think
this
gets
us
back
to
the
case
that
was
argued
yesterday
but
the
right
has
to
be
found
if
there
is
to
be
a
deprivation.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
mr.
justice,
i
think
there
are
several
questions
that
i
do
not
wish
to
conceive
that
there
is
a
fourteenth
amendment
substantive
remedy
here
because
we
really
have
it
examined
or
briefed
in,
and
certainly
i
do
not
conceive
that
procedural
due
process
steps
are
required
in
every
case.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
and,
then
i
have
a
punishment.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
certainly,
the
schools
cannot
do
it.
my
first
position
would
be
that
there
are
adequate
enough
state
remedies
and
no
reasons
to
suspect
that
those
remedies
are
not
being
enforced
that
there
is
no
clear
call
for
federal...
mr.
frank
a.
howard
well,
i
maybe
have
driven
to
the
point
of
relaying,
falling
back
on
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
find
it
is
difficult
to
say
that
a
student
who
suffers
truly
excessive
punishment
cannot
have
any
remedy.
but
i...
mr.
frank
a.
howard
i
would
prefer
mr.
justice
that
it
come
to
you
in
an
appropriate
case
so
that
the
question
can
be
examined
very
carefully
and
i
wish
only
to
make.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
well,
the
only
issue
that
the
court
faces
here
with
respect
to
severe
punishment
is
whether
the
eighth
amendment
reaches
in.
it
was
--
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
a
part
of
the
case
below.
the
fifth
circuit,
for
example,
rejected
an
examination
case
by
case
of
the
punishments
inflicted
in
this
case
and
i
think
at
least
partly
on
the
theory
that
it
gets
the
federal
courts
squarely
into
the
business
of
second-guessing
school
administrators
as
to
whether
proper
punishment
was
necessary
and
if
it
was
then
whether
to
two
licks
or
swats
what
or
five
licks
was
appropriate
in
each
case.
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
that
was
not
an
appropriate
function
of
the
federal
courts
and
i
would
refer
to
your
language
in
bishop
v.
wood,
the
case
involving
the
dismissal
of
the
city
employee
in
which
you
made
the
point
that
the
federal
courts
and
not
the
appropriate
forms
to
pass
on
daily
multitudinous
decisions
which
were
handed
down
everyday
in
public
agencies.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
no,
there
was
not
and
--
the
ordinary
case,
of
course,
involves
a
temporary
detention
and
no
deprivation
of
liberty.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
take
the
extreme
position
that
you
put
me
in
mr.
justice
and
i
only
it
again
that
i
would
urged
court.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
well,
i
had
may
have
to
do
also
with
this
dilemma
of
what
right
in
the
constitution
is
secured?
now,
if
the
eight
amendment
does
not
cover
it,
does
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
its
own
force
and
the
fact
provide
that
right?
mr.
frank
a.
howard
it
was
not
granted,
your
honor
and
that
is
why..
mr.
frank
a.
howard
yes
sir,
i
am
urging
the
court
not
to
rush
to
judgment
on
this
unless
the
case
comes
to
you
with
called
full
briefs
and
argument
because..
mr.
frank
a.
howard
yes
sir
and..
mr.
frank
a.
howard
well,
i
do
not
think
it
does.
i
think
that
these
are
essentially
as
the
fifth
circuit
stated,
tort
claims.
the
constitution
does
not
provide
a
remedy
for
every
wrong
and
section
1983
as
paul
v.
davis
teaches
us.
mr.
frank
a.
howard
yes
sir,
one
of
the
judges
on
the
court
of
appeals
asked
counsel
during
the
argument,
is
this
not
an
attempt
to
use
a
constitutional
cannon
to
kill
florida,
do
away
with
the
florida
flyspeck
and
it
seems
to
me
that
was
an
apt
question.
if
i
might
turn
to
the
due
process
issue,
i
understood
mr.
rogow
yesterday
to
concede
the
point
that
we
make
in
our
brief
and
that
is
that
the
true
issue
here
is
whether
procedural
due
process
steps
are
required
before
the
administration
of
any
punishment,
not
just
severe.
i
would
prefer
to
quarrel
with
his
definition
but
i
do
not
believe
i
have
to.
this
theory
has
been
rejected
by
all
courts
which
have
considered
it,
with
the
exception
of
baker
v.
owen
in
which
this
court
held
that
parental
objection
may
not
overruled
the
administrator's
discretion.
the
court
did
not
review
the
question
of
procedural
due
process
or
it
was
a
precedent
there.
the
baker
court
found
a
few
steps
to
be
a
necessary
and
there
is
one
unreported
cases
from
georgia
which
he
has
cited
in
the
briefs,
which
also
required
a...
goss
v.
lopez
is
the
starting
point,
we
believe
here,
and
the
goss
case
as
we
see
it
was
predicated
upon
the
deprivation
of
the
right
to
education.
that
suspensions
at
least
took
the
child
out
of
school,
away
from
the
education
which
the
state
had
guarantied
to
give
them.
corporal
punishment
in
contrast
is
correction
while
keeping
the
child
in
school.
the
purpose
of
corporal
punishment
as
a
disciplinary
alternative,
is
to
correct
the
child
quickly
while
putting
him
back
to
class.
the
record
here
at
least
shows
there
was
no
retardation
of
progress
of
any
of
the
children.
the
numerous
citations
are
collected
in
brief
to
the
record,
the
students
progressed
fairly,
and
normally
on
through
school.
they
suffered
no
reputational
harm
and
there
is
no
showing
that
future
schooling
or
future
employment
was
jeopardized.
so,
in
so
far
as
the,
in
the
first
inquiry
whether
there
is
a
protected
interest,
the
state
of
florida
guarantees
children
the
right
to
an
education
but
it
does
not
guarantee
them
the
right
to
go
public
school
with
immunity
from
corporal
punishment
in
case
of
misconduct.
the
petitioners
have
sought
to
find
a
secured
right
in
the
fourth
amendment
for
which
there
is
no
case
support
at
all
and
it
was
never
argued
below,
fourth
circuit
did
not
even
deal
with
this
question.
mr.
rogow
suggested
the
number
theory
and
i
do
not
know
how
far
that
goes
or
what
it
covers.
further,
i
think
and
his
most
strongest
reliance
is
on
some
generalized
liberty
interest.
we
say
first
that
there
is
no
deprivation
of
liberty.
the
constitution
says
that
liberty
shall
not
be
deprived
or
taken
away
and
corporal
punishment
in
the
normal
situation,
and
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about,
is
a
temporary
detention
only
for
correctional
purposes.
the
student’s
liberty
interest
is
just
one
ingredient
and
a
balance
of
interest
which
is
then
reached
by
the
states,
by
almost
all
of
the
states.
state
policy
and
history,
in
this
country,
favor
local
educators,
discretion
and
control
in
these
sorts
of
decisions
and
provide
remedies
when
that
discretion
is
abused.
so,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
fall
for
a
federal
mold
which
is
going
to
be
frightening
to
administrators,
probably
self-defeating
in
terms
of
the
use
of
this
remedy.
because
educators
do
not
look
upon
rules
of
the
supreme
court
even
if
they
are
called
informal.
they
do
not
look
upon
them
as
informal.
they
are
mindful
of
wood
v.
strickland,
the
personal
liability
problem,
and
my
time
is
up
and
i
thank
you
for
it.
