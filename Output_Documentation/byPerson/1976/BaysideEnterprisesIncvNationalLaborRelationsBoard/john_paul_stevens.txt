justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
second
case,
bayside
enterprises
versus
national
labor
relations
board,
we
review
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
the
national
labor
relations
act
does
not
cover
agricultural
laborers.
the
question
in
this
case,
is
whether
certain
truck
drivers
who
haul
poultry
feed
from
their
employer's
feed
mills
to
independent
farms
which
are
under
contract
with
the
employer
to
raise
chickens
owned
by
the
employer,
are
agricultural
laborers
covered
by
the
act.
the
labor
board
held
that
they
were
employees
and
ordered
their
employer
to
bargain
with
their
union.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
enforced
that
order.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
conflict
with
decisions
of
the
fifth
and
ninth
circuit.
for
reasons
stated
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
were
unanimously
hold
that
the
drivers
are
not
agricultural
laborers
and
therefore
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
first
circuit.
