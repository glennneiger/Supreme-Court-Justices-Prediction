mr.
alan
j.
levenson
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
alan
levenson
and
i
am
from
portland
maine.
i
am
here
today
representing
bayside
enterprises.
inc.
bayside
is
a
poultry
industry
located
in
waldo
county
up
in
belfast,
near
belfast,
maine.
the
contention
of
bayside
and
this
involves
six
feed
drivers,
the
drive
poultry
trucks,
which
are
these
specialized
trucks
that
deliver
grain.
these
poultry
drivers
are
exempt
from
the
national
labor
relation
act
as
agricultural
labors.
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
agricultural
labors
makes
reference
to
--
because
of
an
act
of
congress
in
1946
and
the
appropriations
act
it
is
referenced
to
3f
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
in
my
brief,
i
have
set
out
3f
and
all
of
this
discussion
today
is
on
page
three
and
all
of
this
discussion
today
revolves
around
3f.
now,
this
3f
has
been
discussed
many
times
before
this
court,
particularly
in
farmers
agricultural
company
and
what
it
says
is
that
to
be
exempt,
you
have
to
either
fall
into
a
primary
classification
or
a
secondary
classification
of
farming.
now,
in
the
poultry
industry,
it
makes
specific
reference
to
the
question
of
raising
poultry.
so,
when
i
talk
about
the
primary
definition
of
agriculture
here,
i
will
be
talking
about
raising
poultry.
the
secondary
definition
talks
about
incidental
tour
conjunction
with
farming
when
performed
by
a
farmer
or
on
a
farm.
so,
i
will
have
to
be
talking
about
farmer
or
on
a
farm
an
incidental
conjunction
with
farming.
there
is
also
a
phrase
preparation
from
market,
which
is
in
the
3f
which
also
has
some
consideration
and
some
courts
have
hints
to
exemption
on
that
point.
the
outline
of
my
argument
is
that
bayside
itself
being
a
vertically
integrated
poultry
organization
comes
within
the
definition
of
primary
agriculture
because
it
is
a
producer
and
that
the
feed
delivery
drivers
are
within
the
secondary
definition
of
agriculture
because
of
their
work
being
incidental
to
in
conjunction
with
farming.
i
will
also
talk
in
terms
of
a
possible
alternative
argument
that
the
feed
poultry
drivers
are
on
the
farm
within
the
meaning
of
that,
those
words.
to
summarize
the
arguments,
the
choice
here,
the
feed
poultry
drivers
are
either
one,
directly
in
farming.
two,
incidentally
to
connected
with
farming
or
three,
not
connected
with
farming
at
all.
i
will
be
talking
about
the
first
two
choices
and
i
will
leave
the
third
choice
to
my
opponent.
briefly,
i
will
like
to
talk
to
you
about
the
facts
of
the
case
and
just
a
little
bit
of
sketch
about
the
poultry
industry.
bayside
is
a
singular
enterprise.
it
produces
and
markets
poultry
up
in
waldo
county
maine.
although,
there
are
two
corporations,
there
is
a
central
management
that
makes
all
the
decisions
of
the
poultry
company
from
one
what
is
called
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
to
raising
poultry.
the
company
is
made
up
of
several
components.
there
is,
besides
the
main
office,
there
is
a
breeding
hatchery
with
the
several
farms
connected
to
it,
a
commercial
hatchery
with
eleven
farms
connected
to
it,
there
is
a
feed
mill,
there
is
the
feed
delivery
operation
which
we
are
talking
about
here.
there
is
a
119
contract
farms
which
i
will
go
into
the
contract
later.
bayside
itself
owns
seven
farms.
there
is
a
processing
plant
with
trucks
to
pick
up
the
poultry
from
the
farms
and
deliver
it
to
the
processing
plant.
briefly,
this
is
how
it
works
out.
the
company
has
a
geneticist
who
makes
the
decisions
as
to
what
type
of
poultry
they
should
grow.
they
have
been
very
successful
because
they
have
reduced
the
time
it
takes
to
grow
from
a
broiler
from
16
weeks
to
about
9
weeks
and
they
make
such
decisions
as
how
to
grow
a
chicken
with
white
meat
or
how
to
speed
up
its
maturity
and
things
like
that.
you
see,
it’s
a
very
valuable,
integrate
part
of
the
business
of
raising
chickens.
well,
after
they
decide
that,
they
may
breed
flocks
to
produce
the
eggs.
then,
they
take
the
eggs
and
they
hatch
them
till
they
are
one
day
old.
then,
they
take
and
they
place
these
one
day
old
broilers
on
these
contract
farms.
while
they
are
doing
that,
they
have
a
feed
mill
and
they
are
making
feed
for
the
broilers
which
changes
according
to
age.
they
change
it
at
least
four
times
and
if
the
flock
is
unhealthy,
then
they
change
it
more
times
than
that.
then
they
have
this
feed
delivery
system
which
i
will
talk
about
later
that
delivers
the
feed
from
the
feed
mill
to
the
processing
plant,
no,
from
the
feed
from
the
feed
mill
to
the
contract
farms.
then,
while
the
poultry
is
on
the
farms
and
the
poultry
stays
on
the
farm
for
about
nine
weeks
when
they
take
it
off.
they
have
these
feed
crews
that
go
on
to
the
farm
and
they
vaccinate,
blood
test,
debeak
and
all
the
things
that
you
do
to
keep
up
the
health
and
well-being
of
the
poultry.
after
the
flock
leaves,
the
farm
crews
go
and
they
clean
the
poultry
farms
of
the
contract
farmers
and
while
this
is
all
going
on,
this
is
all
being
directed
by
a
broiler
department
manager
who
directs
the
supervisors,
the
forest
farm
supervisors
that
check
the
farmers
and
then
there
is
a
farm
crew.
he
decides
what
age
to
market
the
flock
and
what
sizes
of
the
birds
are
marketable
and
then
he
sends
out
the
crew
from
the
processing
plant
who
catches,
coops
and
loads
the
birds
for
transport
to
the
processing
plant.
the
processing
plant
processes
the
birds
and
markets
them
to
a
dealer
or
a
chain
or
some
intermediate
third
party.
now,
all
of
this
that
bayside
is
doing
is
typical
of
what's
going
on
in
the
poultry
industry.
it’s
a
typically
integrated
broiler
producing
marketing
firm.
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
well,
i
am
going
to
be
very
cautious
here
about
talking
about
any
other
industry
than
poultry.
i
can
talk
about
the
poultry
industry
that
this
is
all
of
the
evidence
and
the
marketing
reports
that
are
filed
with
this
court
talks
about
poultry
and
they
say
that
95%
of
the
chickens
that
are
eaten
today
are
coming
from
a
vertically
integrated
producer
of
one
kind
or
another
and
that’s
what
i
say,
i
cant
talk
about
cattle
or
anything
else.
now,
the
other
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
nearly
all
the
broilers
today
are
produced
by
integrated
broiler
firms
and
that
this
development
has
gradually
arisen.
now,
what
used
to
happen
in
the
past,
there
used
to
be
individual
processing
plants
and
individual
feed
mills
and
then
there
was
individual
delivery
systems
and
as
the
farm
and
the
poultry
industry
gradually
evolved,
each
of
these
firms
developed
so
that
gradually,
it
became
a
concentration
so
that
each
one
of
these
took
in
all
the
attributes
of
one
firm.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
basically,
there
are
four
elements;
i
mean
big
substantial
components
of
--
this
type
of
vertically
integrated.
they
are
the
feed
mill,
the
processing
plant,
the
hatcheries
and
the
producers,
the
contract
growers.
gradually,
they
all
came
together
under
one
management
and
basically,
they
are
all
interdependent
on
each
other
and
the
management
is
like
a
bundle
of
sticks
and
they
are
all
held
together
and
the
thing
that
holds
them
together
is
the
management
that’s
making
all
the
decisions
as
to
what's
going
to
happen.
well,
as
a
result
of
this
development,
the
fact
that
is
important
to
me
it
seems
that
there
really
is
no
significant
live
broiler
market
today.
you
can’t
go
and
raise
chickens
and
sell
them
to
anyone.
all
of
these
farmers
are
connected
to
some
type
of
broiler
organization.
now
that
becomes
critical
when
i
talk
about
the
part
of
the
processing
plant
to
this
whole
operation.
they
are
all
marketed
as
ready
to
cook
broilers
by
an
integrated
company.
now,
the
argument
of
bayside
is
because
of
this
type
of
operation,
that
it
is
bayside
and
vertically
integrated
operators
like
bayside,
that
are
in
effect
the
operators,
the
producers
within
the
contemplation
of
the
statutes,
they
are
the
farmers
and
basically
that
argument
breaks
down
into
four
elements.
first
of
all,
the
company
is
the
one
that
initiates
the
production
process,
it
is
the
one
that
invests
in
both
production
and
marketing
of
poultry,
it
is
the
one
that
controls
all
the
marketing,
production
and
poultrying
and
fourthly,
it
is
the
one
that
actively
participates
in
the
management
of
the
flock
and
the
poultry
husbandry.
now,
this
position
is
sustained
by
two
major
cases
in
the
poultry
industry
and
one
is
tyson
poultrying
and
the
other
is
nlrb
versus
strain.
now,
there
are
other
cases
that
sustain
my
position,
but
the
discussion,
the
rational
is
set
out
in
those
two
cases.
tyson
was
an
egg
producer
and
strain
was
a
chicken,
poultry
farmer
like
this
one.
the
contrary
argument
is
that
it
is
the
contract
farmers
that
are
raising
the
poultry
and
that
they
should
be
considered
the
farmer
and
that
has
a
ring
of
simplicity
in
it
because
the
chickens
are
on
the
contract
farms.
when
the
court
in
strain
took
this
under
consideration,
they
framed
the
issue
this
way,
does
the
fact
that
the
integrator
uses
independent
growers,
destroy
its
claim
to
having
raise
the
bird
or
is
the
integrator
more
akin
to
the
purchaser
of
the
bird.
the
court
then
reviewed
the
same
factual
type
of
situation
that
i
have
described
and
said,
“even
though
the
raising
of
the
birds
was
shared
with
independent
growers,
strain’s
activity
were
more
nearly
that
of
one
engaged
in
raising
poultry
than
a
purchaser
or
a
jobber.”
when
tyson
took
up
the
same
situation,
it
said,
“we
are
here
concerned
with
the
single
completely
integrated
farming
operation.”
tyson
is
the
farmers
and
they
are
the
ones
who
initiated
the
farming
operations
here
in
(inaudible)
without
the
appellees
that
is
tyson,
the
independent
growers
arguably
would
never
have
undertaken
the
initial
and
continuing
cost
of
acquiring
the
birds
and
producing
the
eggs,
the
contract
growers
merely
aid
the
appellees
who
are
the
farmers.
so,
the
issue
drawn
is,
is
a
company
like
bayside,
a
middle
man,
is
it
somebody
that
is
kind
of
buying
the
chickens
from
the
farms,
is
it
somebody
that
is
a
purchaser,
a
distributor
or
something
like
that
and
the
argument
has
been
made
many
times
and
the
rational
and
strain
really
talked
about
are
rosebush
case,
they
said,
no,
it
was
not
--
i
mean
the
rosebush
case
that
they
decided
was
more
of
a
middle
man
because
they
were
buying
it,
they
were
only
buying
things
that
were
marketable
or
a
purchaser
or
something
like
that.
well,
all
of
this
gets
down
to
the
core
of
the
question
or
what
some
people
feel
the
core
is,
the
risk
of
loss.
who
is
taking
the
risk
of
this
type
of
operation
between
the
farmers
on
the
farm
and
the
vertically
integrator
that
is
supervising
all
of
this?
well,
that
involves
the
contract
itself;
the
contract
guarantees
the
farmer
a
specific
rate
per
week
depending
upon
the
size
of
the
house.
he
then
gives
it
an
additional
bonus
depending
on
his
production
as
compared
to
other
bayside
contract
farmers.
bear
in
mind
that
bayside
owns
the
flocks
at
all
time
and
that
the
chickens
are
a
perishable
commodity.
the
point
that
i
would
like
to
make,
is
that
the
payments
to
the
grower
have
no
relationship
to
the
market
price
that
bayside
eventually
gets
from
it.
whatever
happens,
the
farmer
gets
a
certain
guarantee
payment
and
then
he
does
participate
in
a
bonus
depending
on
anybody
else.
now,
this
can
work
out
several
ways
because
bear
in
mind
there
are
two
markets
involved,
one
is
the
feed
market,
the
grain
that
you
have
to
buy
and
the
other
is
the
large
market,
i
mean
the
process
market
that
you
have
to
sell.
so,
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
the
man,
who
is
the
farmer
can
receive
a
profit
from
his
operation
and
then
that
same
chicken
can
go
out,
be
processed
and
sent
to
market
and
the
vertically
integrator
can
lose
money
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
the
cost
of
grain
can
be
more
expensive
than
the
cost
of
selling
the
bird.
it
seems
to
me
that
some
what
critical.
on
the
discussion
of
this
at
the
trial
level,
we
talked
a
lot
about
who
has
the
risk
of
loss
and
i
was
trying
to
prove
that
we
had
all
the
risk
of
loss,
but
there
is
no
question
it
seems
to
me
that
some
of
the
risk
of
loss,
are
if
a
man
has
--
well,
if
a
man
is
employing
other
people,
he
would
invest
some
money,
so
he
would
make
less
money
then
he
would
otherwise,
but
there
is
a
case
on
this
that
has
been
pointed
out
to
me
about
ducks.
in
the
tax
court,
and
it
is
called
maple
leaf
farms
64,
438,
tax
court
what
they
say
there
is
that
the
risk
is
really
unequal,
in
other
words,
a
man
who
is
a
farmer,
in
this
type
of
situation
with
a
contract
can
really
gage
the
kind
of
loss
he
is
going
to
--
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
loss,
he
is
kind
of
gage
what
kind
of
money
he
is
going
to
get
in
advance.
while,
the
person
who
is
the
vertically
integrator
has
to
deal
with
markets
that
are
unveiled
that
you
never
know
what
you
going
to
get
and
that
kind
of
is
a
critical
factor
in
talking
about
who
is
really
running
the
farm
and
who
is
not
running
the
farm.
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
no,
no,
it
was
decided
in
1975
and
it
is
just
pointed
out
that…
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
it
is
64
tax
court
438
and
one
of
the
citations
that
says
on
page
451,
of
that
case,
it
says,
obviously
this
was
talking
about
duck
grower.
obviously
the
grower
also
pores
some
risk
of
loss
from
the
growing
process,
example,
nonpayment
for
condemned
ducks
and
out
of
pocket
cost
the
labor,
but
on
balance,
we
believe
that
the
petitioner,
integrator
assumed
a
risk
of
loss
from
the
growing
process
of
sufficient
magnitude
to
satisfy
this
element
of
the
farmer
formula.
one
need
not
bear
all
the
risk
of
loss
to
be
considered
a
farmer,
and
they
said
also
there
is
another
case
of
an
integrated
egg
producer
garth
(ph)
and
that
is
56
tax
court
610.
if
you
just
turn
to
the
appendix
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
you
will
find
the
contract
itself,
what
we
are
talking
about.
now,
under
the
pamphlet
that
the
government
was
kind
enough
to
provide
us,
entitled
the
main
poultry
industry
on
page
13,
they
say
that
this
type
of
contract
is
called
a
straight
payment
type
contract
rather
than
a
share
the
profit
type.
if
only
the
southern
growers
have
a
share
the
profit
type
and
the
main
people
have
a
straight
payment
type,
i
do
not
rely
on
that
to
say
that
the
southern
growers
are
not
integrators,
i
am
just
saying
that
there
is
a
slight
difference
between
the
two,
it
would
still
be
applied
the
same
way.

guaranteed
a
broiler
grower.
basically
what
happens
is
they
are
paid,
a
certain
rate
per
foot
of
their
house,
the
bigger
house
they
have,
the
more
money
they
get
per
week.
it
comes
out
to
about
a
cent
or
a
cent
and
a
quarter
a
week,
they
get
paid.
the
payment
sometimes
is
after
the
flock
is
processed,
but
that
is
the
guarantee
they
have
given.
now,
the
bonus
is
made
up
of
the
--
they
take
all
the
flocks
that
are
processed
over
a
certain
time
and
they
see,
they
can
pair
one
flock
with
the
other
and
see
how
the
farmers
did
this
against
each
other
and
they
give
a
bonus
to
the
farmers
who
did
the
best,
that
is
basically
what
is
going
on,
it
is
somewhat
complicated
structure
how
they
do
it,
but
that
is
basically
what
is
happening.
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
no,
absolutely
not,
the
bonus
depends
upon
how
these
people
did…
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
no,
no,
not
cost
wise
in
terms
of
weight.
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
no,
not
at
all,
it
depends
on
how
bigger
poultry
house
they
have.
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
the
chickens
die,
the
risk
of
loss
is
on
the
company
because
the
company
owns
the
chicken.
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
well,
you
just
do
not
use
him
next
time.
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
now,
however
talking
about
this
contract
that
i
have
before
you,
i
like
to
point
out
to
you
that
the
integrator
provides
the
chicks,
the
feed,
the
medication,
the
fuel
and
the
litter.
now,
the
significance
of
providing
the
chicks
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
be
very
important
because
you
can
easily
see
it
if
you
were
providing
--
you
had
an
egg
business
because
then
the
product
would
be
the
egg
and
you
were
producing,
you
were
giving
the
farmer
chicken
and
out
you
come
with
an
egg.
what
you
are
getting
here
is
you
are
getting
the
meat
itself
so,
that
the
farmer,
so,
that
the
product
really
isn’t
the
chicken,
it's
the
meat.
now,
the
significance
of
that
is
it
is
the
equivalent
of
giving
a
corn
farmer
40
acre
of
land
and
says
go
raise
corn
because
the
product
will
ultimately
be
corn.
here,
you
are
giving
them
the
chickens,
they
go
raise
meat
and
you
will
get
ultimately,
processed
meat.
what
i
am
saying
is,
it
is
not
just
the
ownership
of
the
birds
that’s
important
in
this
relationship.
i
think
it
is
very
important,
the
fact
that
the
product
is
the
meat
itself.
now,
as
part
of
this
contract
on
a
(26)
of
this,
the
grower
under
(1)
agrees
to
follow
the
instructions
of
the
bayside
supervisor
in
the
care
and
the
maintenance
of
the
flocks.
it's
on
page
a
(26–10).
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
of
the
same
contract.
in
other
words,
when
we
talk
about
the
growers’
obligation,
that
grower
obligates
himself
by
contract
to
follow
the
instruction
of
the
bayside
supervisor
in
the
care
and
the
management
of
the
flocks.
on
a
(27),
he
also
agrees
to
allow
bayside
to
remove
the
flocks
from
the
farm
at
any
time.
that’s
on
number
11.
back
to
a
(26)
on
4
that
contract
farmer
agrees
to
have
no
poultry
other
than
bayside’s
on
the
farm
during
the
period
of
this
contract.
so,
he
is
restricted,
he
cannot
have
anybody
else’s
poultry
except
bayside’s
and
number
four
well,
he
guarantees
to
use
only
those
materials
supplied
by
bayside
for
the
purposes
of
feeding
and
maintaining
birds
under
this
contract.
so,
my
point
is
that
this
is
another
disability
than
when
a
grower
enters
into
this
contract
with
the
integrator
that
he
undertakes.
now,
the
point
is
that
the
grower
himself,
if
you
look
at
the
growers’
position
in
this,
he
isn’t
the
type
of
typical
independent
producer.
he
does
not
own
the
feed,
he
does
not
purchase
or
own
the
chicks,
he
does
not
decide
what
type
of
birds
he
wants
to
grow
or
what
type
of
feed
he
wants
to
feed
them.
he
does
not
decide
when
to
market
the
flock,
he
does
not
receive
a
market
price
when
the
flock
is
taken,
he
has
no
obligation
to
transport
the
feed
to
his
farm,
nor
catch
coupon
deliver
the
mature
birds
at
the
processing
plant.
he
must
follow
direction
of
the
bayside
broiler
department
manager,
field
supervisors
and
farm
crews
and
he
does
not
vaccinate,
blood
test,
debeak
and
he
bears
only
his
secondary
responsibility
for
the
health
of
the
flock
and
treatment
if
it
is
sick.
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
well,
i
don’t
think
–
see,
if
you
are
talking
to
a
person
who
doesn’t
think
there
is
any
question….
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
well,
if
the
flock….
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
i
suppose….
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
well,
i
suppose
this
whole
thing….
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
well,
i
suppose
the
whole
thing
has
evolved
because
the
fact
instead
of
dealing
from
one….
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
thank
you.
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
thank
you.
i
will
try
and
use
them
wisely.
when
last
we
broke
for
dinner
you
asked
me
the
question
as
to
how
this
all
happened.
well,…
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
well,
this
book
that
supplied
you
dynamic
factors
and
vertically
commodity
systems
on
page….
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
no,
on
page
40
there
is
this
sentence,
“the
change
forces
and
responding
decisions
which
have
brought
the
broiler
system
to
its
present
position
represent
a
fascinating
example
of
an
evolvement,
of
an
evolving,
energetic,
free
enterprise
system.
to
a
large
extent,
change
has
occurred
through
a
series
of
decisions
each
of
which
created
a
small
incremental
changes,
but
whose
cumulative
effect
has
been
substantial.
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
the
problem
of
this
business
is
the
risk.
the
risk
is
terrible,
probably
three
out
of
four
years
you
lose
money.
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
the
risk
is
on
both
of
the....the
risk
is
--
the
poor
farmer
who
tries
to
buy
the
grain
and
raise
chicks
has
taken
a
terrible
risk.
it
gives
him
the
advantage
of
a
guaranteed
type
of….
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
well….
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
i
don’t
think
they
are
employees.
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
they
don’t
pay
social
security
or
things
like
that.
no
they….
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
no,
they
not,
but
what
i
do
say
is
the….
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
what
is
that?
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
court
liability.
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
i
think
in
the
contract
it
says
something
about
the
fact
that
they
will
be
liable
if
anybody
gets
hurt
in
their
own
farms.
so,
to
that
extent
i
think
then
there
is
no
question
about
it,
they
have
independence.
the
question
is
about
do
they
have
enough
independence
to
be
considered
a
producer
or
who
is
the
producer,
who
is
the
middleman
here,
i
mean
that’s
the
issue.
there
is
one
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
refer
you
to
and
that’s
the
administrative
regulations
that
the
department
of
labor
puts
out
of
the
wage
and
hour
division.
in
780.125(b)
there
they
take
up
the
business
about
the
words,
‘raising
a
poultry’
and
it
says,
the
raising
of
poultry
includes
the
breeding,
hatchery,
propagating,
feeding
and
general
care
of
poultry
all
those
things
that
bayside
is
doing.
now,
the
other
part
of
this
argument
that
the
first
circuit
was
particularly
attracted
to
was
the
processing
plant.
they
seem
to
take
the
position
that
because
so
many
people
are
in
processing
nearby,
the
whole
things
takes
on
a
commercial
coloration.
now,
the
answer
to
that
argument
it
seems
to
me
is
in
maneja.
they
make
the
distinction
about
processing,
there
is
an
agricultural
processing
and
there
is
a
manufacturing
processing
and
they
say
that
this
distinction
is
if
the
product
actually
changes
its
composition.
in
maneja
at
page
268
agricultural
function,
there
is
a
manufacturing
function
saying
there
must
be
a
change
in
the
product.
now,
this
very
issue
about
poultry
has
been
clarified
in
the
case
here
east
texas
motor
freight
lines
versus
frozen
food
express
and
that’s
a
351
u.s.
49
and
there
they
had
a
frozen
piece
of
poultry
and
then
they
said
that
a
frozen
and
fresh
dressed
piece
of
poultry
retains
a
continuing,
substantial
identity.
so,
the
point
i
am
making
is
that
is
a
fact
that….
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
that’s
true.
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
what
i
am
saying
to
you
is….
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
that’s
true.
what
i
am
saying….
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
what
i
am
saying
is
that,
for
the
purposes
of
this
type
of
classification,
they
regard
them
as
not
as
a
cooked
chicken
or
as
a
string
bean
that
is
cooked
in
a
dish
or
something
or
in
a
can
or
something
like
that.
for
this
type
of
purpose,
evidently
this
court
has
made
the
finding
at
least
in
the
freight
lines
case
that
it
is
the
continuing
substantial
identity.
what
i
am
saying
is
these
days,
because
everybody
is
vertically
integrated,
not
to
market
the
thing,
you
have
got
to
market
it,
dressed
and
frozen.
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
well,
you
must
understand
when
you
say….
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
no,
no
that
isn’t
right.
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
well,
it
is
a
great
many
things.
the
first
of
all,
a
part
of
the
growing
process
is
to
figure
out
what
kind
of
bird
you
are
going
to
grow,
second
of
all
is
to
breed
the
eggs
then
you
have
got
to
take
them
on
to
the
farm,
then
you
have
got
to
have
your
farm
crews
that
goes
on
and
vaccine
them.
you
are
actually
getting
into
the
type
of
growing
procedure.
i
mean
you
are
really
are
participating.
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
the
only
thing
that
happens
on
the
independent
contractors’
farms...
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
the
only
thing
that
happens
is
that
from
nine
days
old,
he
goes
from
one
day
old
to
nine
weeks
old.
but
in
the
process,
the
decision
for
that
chicken
is
being
made
by
man
who
is
head
of
the
poultry
division
of
the
company.
what
to
feed
it.
when
you
are
talking
about
these
truck
drivers
and
you
are
talking
about
the
grower
you
know
what
he
does,
he
pushes
a
lever
and
out
there
is
an
auger
that
outcomes
the
feed.
that
is
his
total
contribution
to
the
growing
of
a
chicken.
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
no,
under
the
contract
bayside...
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
what?
bayside
has
a
farm
crew
that
sends
right
into
the
pans
that
cleans
them
out.
that’s
part
of
the
deed.
what
do
you
think.
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
no,
when
you
take
them
out.
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
oh,
during
the
nine
week
period
look,
i
ascertain...
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
the
strain
case…
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
i
am
not
addressed
to
any
word
here.
the
question
is
the
substance
of
the
situation
then
evidently,
what
even
strain
says
is
they
are
participating
in
the
growing
process.
could
i…
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
i
would
like,could
i…
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
thank
you.
mr.
alan
j.
levenson
thank
you
your
honor.
in
my
presentation
in
chief,
i
never
got
to
the
question
about
incidental
to
in
conjunction
with
farming
and
i
would
like
to
do
it
right
now.
in
the
regulations
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
i
would
like
to
make
reference
to
you
for
a
future
research,
780.1578
and
that
says,
“in
case
of
transportation
to
farm
of
materials
of
supplies,
it
seems
clear,
that
transportation
to
the
farm
by
the
farmer
of
materials
and
supplies
for
using
his
farming
operations
such
as
seed,
animal
or
poultry
feed,
farm
machinery
or
equipment
would
be
incidental
to
the
farmer’s
actual
farming
operation.”
now,
in
maneja
which
they
have
quoted,
that
is
349u.s.262,
similarly
the
exemption
clearly
covers
the
transportation
of
farm
implements,
supplies
and
field
workers
too
in
from
the
fields.
in
farmers
reservoir,
which
mrs.
shapiro
quote’s
is
saying
that
is
not
incidental
to
in
conjunction
with
farming.
i
dispute
that
entirely.
turn
at
337
u.s.
766,
it
is
speaking
about
the
delivery
of
water
to
the
head
gates
of
farms
by
irrigation
company
workers,
“it
is
equally
clear
that
it
does
constitute
a
practice
performed
as
in
incident
to
or
in
conjunction
with
farming.
the
irrigation
company
workers
were
not
exempt
however,
because
the
delivery
was
not
by
a
farmer
or
in
a
farm.”
abbott
farms,
487,
904
holds
the
production
in
high
and
incidental
to
in
conjunction
with
poultry
is
farming.
where
it
expresses
our
(inaudible)
of
the
farms
372,
584,
589,
footnote
4,
movement
of
food
and
workers
to
the
fields
has
significance
in
purpose
only
in
making
it
possible
for
the
harvesting
activities
to
take
place.
what
i
am
saying,
if
you
own
an
individual
feedmill
and
you
have
got
truck
drivers
permit,
those
truck
drivers
are
incidental
to
in
conjunction
with
the
mill,
makes
sense,
but
if
you
own
three
million
chickens
all
over
the
farms,
you
are
trying
to
raise
chickens,
you
are
not
trying
to
raise
deliver
feed.
with
regard
to
the,
how
the
feedmill
works,
one-third
of
the
production
went
to
an
independent
feed
company
at
the
time
they
brought
the
thing.
it
does
not
go
to
it
now,
but
the
feed
that
goes
to
the
farms,
only
if
driven
by
bayside
drivers
to
bayside
farms,
they
connect
it
up
at
the
feedmill,
they
pour
it
in
the
truck,
they
drive
to
it
and
they
unload
it
at
the
farms.
these
days,
what
is
feeding
the
chicken?
the
guy
who
is
deciding
who
is
–
what
the
feed
that
chicken
is
extremely
important,
because
he
is
deciding
how
to
change
the
feed
every
minute
or
the
third.
one
more
thing,
i
have
left
out
this
business
on
our
farms.
in
modern
day
farming,
you
got
at
least
four
separate
elements,
you
have
got
the
hatcheries,
you
have
got
the
poultry
processing
plant,
you
have
got
the
feedmill
and
you
have
got
the
poultry
growers.
what
is
the
farm?
i
contend
the
farm
is
everything.
every
element
of
that
thing
is
on
the
farm.
what
is
the
driver
doing?
he
is
driving
from
the
feedmill
to
the
contract
farms.
that
leaves
open
the
question,
what
about
the
highways,
driving
back
and
forth
in
that
highway,
that
is
the
weakness
in
the
idea,
that
is
addressed
by
the
case
of
nlrb
versus
olaa
sugar,
242
f.2,
at
page
717,
“it
is
common
knowledge
that
even
small
farms
are
frequently
bisected
by
public
roads,
even
small
farm
operators
frequently
owner
operated
non-contiguous
field
reached
only
by
public
roads.”
if
such
a
farmer
send
his
truck
driver
to
hull
hay,
built
in
a
distant
field
to
be
stacking
of
the
farm
building,
the
operation
would
not
seize
to
be
an
agriculture
one,
even
if
the
employee
make
some
use
of
the
public
road
in
his
trip.
that
this
be
true
in
the
case
of
a
full
small
farmer,
the
case
should
also
be
true
here.
you
have
also
got
this
case
of
brannon
versus
sugar
growers,

f.2,
1011,
those
who
were
cooks,
they
were
cooking
in
a
labor
camp
and,
“they
held
that
they
were
on
as
farm
as
much
as
you
could
be
on
a
farm,
given
the
fact
you
were
in
the
labor
camp.”
what
i
am
saying
is
the
primary
purpose
of
this
statute
is
if
you
are
in
agriculture,
well
now-a-days,
that
is
agriculture
and
they
just
would
not
recognize
this
when
they
take
and
they
combine
all
these
elements
into
one
that
you
are
back
to
the
original
farm
and
doing
everything.
now,
you
have
got
the
whole
thing
doing
everything.
now,
the
question
that
maneja
raises
and
the
reason
that
i
am
not
saying
that
this
is
primary
farming,
is
for
some
reason
maneja
says,
this
transportation
of
a
truck
from
a
field
is
secondary
farming.
olaa
sugar
questions
that
you
can
not
understand
why
that
is
not
part
of
the
harvesting
operation.
i
say
to
you
quite
frankly
and
i
have
never
understood
why
it
is
not
part
of
raising
poultry.
it
is
not
incidental
to,
it
is
direct
poultry
and
that
is
the
issue
to
me.
i
was
exempt
either
one
or
the
other,
but
i
never
considered
that
i
was
not
exempt.
my
time
has
run
out,
thank
you.
