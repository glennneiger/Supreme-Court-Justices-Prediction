ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
requires
this
court
to
interpret
the
agricultural
exemptions
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
that
exemption
is
set
out
on
page
2
of
our
brief
and
it
involves
three
separate
categories.
first,
it
exempts
actual
farming
operations
including
the
raising
of
poultry.
second,
it
also
exempts
other
activities
by
a
farmer
that
are
incidental
to
his
farm
operations
and
third,
it
exempts
activities
which
are
out
of
farm
and
incidental
to
that
farm’s
operations.
now,
particular…
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
it
probably
would.
petitioner’s
claim
is
that
the
truck
drivers
here
that
take
the
feed
from
petitioner’s
feedmill
to
the
grow-out
farms
are
exempt
under
the
second
part
of
the
definition
that
is
that
there
are
activities
by
a
farmer
which
are
incidental
to
the
operation
of
that
farm.
so,
to
support
his
claim,
petitioner
must
show
first
that
bayside
is
a
farmer
and
second,
that
the
work
of
the
feed
truck
drivers
is
incidental
to
bayside’s
farm
operations.
so,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question
it
wouldn’t
be
enough
for
this
court
to
decide
contrary
to
our
position
that
bayside
as
a
whole
is
a
farmer
in
relation
to
its
growers.
you
would
also
have
to
decide
whether
the
feedmill
operation
was
an
incident
to
that
farming
and
it
still
have
another
question,
if
you
decided
the
feedmill
operation
was
not
incident
to
the
farming,
the
question
would
be
whether
the
truck
drivers’
work
intrudent
to
the
feedmill
or
to
the
farm.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
bayside
does
own
certain
–
they
do
own
the
hatcheries
and
the
breeder
farms
and
the
people
that
are
working
on
those
farms
are
within
the
primary
exemption
but...
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no,
then
in
that
situation
you
would
have
to
decide
whether
the
truck
drivers
were
incidental
to
the
feedmill
operation
or
to
the
farm
operation.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yeah,
but
your
hypothetical
i
thought
was
that
if
the
feedmill
truck
was
that
he
owned
the
truck.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
you
have
to
get
back
to
the
statute.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
think
it's
a
necessary
implication
in
the
statute
because
the
statute
sets
up
these
various
categories.
the
first
is
primary
farming
and
second,
the
statute
recognizes
that
a
farmer
has
incidental
operations
and
also
may
have
non-incidental
operations.
that
is
why
it
says
incidental
farm
operations
are
within
the
agricultural
exemption,
but
non-incidental
farm
operations
are
not.
so,
you
have
got
to
compartmentalize.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yeah,
this
is
--
what
we
are
talking
about
is
an
exemption
that
is
brought
into
the
national
labor
relations
act
by
the
appropriations
acts
which
say
that
this
definition
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
is
to
be
used
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
there
is
a
fair
labor
standards
act
that
the
regulations
that
i
am
referring
to
are
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that
is
certainly
the
way
you
use
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
national
labor
relations
board
interpreted...
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
guess
they
have
been.
i
don’t
know
that
they
have
been,
i
mean
i
don’t
think
that
the
regulation
that
we
rely
on
in
our
brief
is
exactly
in
1938.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
they
certainly
do.
we
referred
to
them
in
our
brief
and
so
the
labor
department
feels
that
the
companies
like
bayside
are
not
to
be
considered
farmers
for
the
purposes
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
board
certainly
follows
that
interpretation.
the
only
other
point
about
the
question
of
that
mr.
justice
white
raised
before
lunch
is
that
if
this
court
should
agree
that
bayside’s
relationships
with
its
grow-out
farmers
make
it
a
farmer,
then
neither
the
board
nor
the
court
below
addressed,
saw
the
case
that
way.
so,
that
they
didn’t
reach
the
question
that
you
would
have
to
reach
then
about
whether
the
operations
of
the
truck
drivers
were
incidental
to
the
farm
operation
as
thus
defined
and
it
would
probably
be
inappropriate
to
send
the
case
back
for
consideration
of
that
question.
our
primary
argument
is
that
bayside
as
a
whole
is
not
a
farmer
instead,
it
is
complex
integrated
company
that
contracts
with
farmers.
it
does
run
a
limited
farming
operation
itself
the
hatcheries
and
the
breeder
farms
and
does
have
some
purely
industrial
operations.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
certainly
do,
yes.
the
feedmill
is
on
our
view
is
one
of
the
industrial
operations
and
the
work
of
the
feedmill
truck
drivers
is
incidental
to
that
operation.
that’s
why
we
have
to
believe
they
are
not
within
the
agricultural
exemption.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
it
does.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
it
sells
to
a
group
of
farmers
who
are
connected
with
another
integrated
poultry
companies
that
doesn’t
have
its
own
processing
plant.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
independent
of
bayside.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
believe
that
that
was
at
the
time
of
the
board
decision;
i
think
that
bayside’s
brief
says
that
they
no
longer
do.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yeah,
i
think
that’s
correct.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
right.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
you
would
still
have
to
decide
in
that
case
whether
the
feedmill
operation
is
incidental
to
bayside’s
farm
operation.
we
would
still
be
fighting
about
the
truck
drivers.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
if
you
felt
that
bayside
was
a
farmer,
that
the
second
part
of
the
definition
which
is
what
we
really
are
arguing
about
here,
it
says
to
get
in
to
that
exemption,
you
have
to
be
both
–
the
activity
has
to
be
by
a
farmer
and
also,
it
has
to
be
incidental
to
that
farmer’s
farm
operations.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
this
particular
fight
is
over
these
drivers.
i
suppose
if
you
took
bayside’s
argument
that
they
are
as
a
whole,
they
are
an
agricultural
enterprise,
the
next
case
you
would
have
would
be
the
feedmill
employees,
the
processing
plant
employees
and
then
you
would
have
to
decide
whether
the
processing
plant
was
incidental.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
you
do
have
to
decide
if
you
accept
their
argument.
you
do
have
to
decide
whether
the
feedmill
is
incidental,
but
only
in
relation
to
them.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that’s
a
–
yes,
i
think
it
does.
bayside’s
claim
is
that
they
are
not
a
feed
dealer
and
processor
and
that
the
first
statement
limits
the
description.
they
certainly,
do
produce
feed
and
they
do
process
and
the
description
of
the
typical
kind
of
an
operation
that’s
in
the
body
of
this
regulation
fits
exactly
what
we
question
was.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
yes,
in
the
national
labor
relation
board…
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
this
case
is
the
result
of
a
fairly
long-term
of…
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that’s...
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
they
have
done
so
consistently.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
i
have
put
it
on
11.
our
argument
basically,
is
that
the
growers
are
the
farmers
and
bayside
is
not.
our
brief
examines
the
terms
of
bayside's
agreements
with
the
growers
to
show
why
in
our
view,
the
growers
are
independent
farmers
in
terms
of
the
risks
they
bear
and
the
capital
investments
required
and
the
type
of
supervision
they
receive.
again,
i
think
that
the
practical
answer
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question
is
that
the
one
of
the
reasons
for
this
arrangement
is
that
it
does
permit
bayside
to
share
the
risks.
it
also
avoids
bayside
having
to
have
the
capital
investments
which
are
very
substantial
in
the…
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
and
that’s
the
point
i
want
to
emphasize
here…
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
answer
to
that
in
the
case,
the
farmers
irrigation
company
case
the
interpret
of
this
same
language.
the
situation
there
was
that
there
was
an
association
of
farmers
that
provided
water
to
the
–
to
irrigate
the
individual
farmer’s
crops
and
the
argument
there
was
made
as
you
say,
water
is
essential
to
growing
crops.
you
can't
grow
crops
unless
you
have
water.
in
the
same
way
here,
but
the
court
said
no
the
statute
talks
about
actual
farming
and
that
the
actual
farming
means
the
growing
of
the
crops
and
actual
farming
means
the
growing
of
the
chickens.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
that’s...
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
that
is
in
the
third
part
of
the
exemption
which…
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
when
the
statute
was
enacted,
the
argument
was
made
that,
threshers
who
in
the
same
--
at
one
point
farmers
did
their
own
threshing.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
as
long
as
the
operation
is
the
basic
part
of
farming,
the
growing
of
the
chickens,
the
raising
of
the
crops,
then
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
what
the
scale
of
the
operation
is
or…
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
but
when
the
statute
was
enacted,
the
congress
was
concerned
that
the
basic
definition
of
agriculture
would
not
include
people
who
were
not
farmers
and
were
not
working
for
farmers,
but
were
doing
essential
farm
operations.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
they
are
working
for
a
farmer
on
operations
that
are
incidental
to
his
farm
operations.
they
are
not
growing
the
crops,
they
are
not
raising
the
livestock,
but
they
are
performing
necessary
incidental
operations
by
the
farmer.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
man
who
is
not
working
for
the
farmer
but
is
sent
into
the
farm,
working
for
someone
else
while
is
not
working
for
the
farmer
and
as
i
said,
the
third
exemption
covers
people
who
are
not
working
for
the
farmer
but
are
working
on
the
farm,
so
the
mr.
justice
white’s
man
who
is
working
for
an
independent
company,
but
working
on
the
farm
is
within
the
third
exemption.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
who
is
driving
them?
are
they
people…
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
and
the
truck
drivers
are
--
the
little
truck
drivers
are
employed
by
the
farm?
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
they
are
in
the
secondary
part.
they
are
not
engaged
in
the
primary
part.
they
are
engaged
in
the
secondary
part.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no,
the
person
who
drove
the
little
truck
on
to
the
farm
was
he
employed
by
the
farmer?
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
okay,
that
the
big
truck
driver
is
not
employed
by
somebody
who
is
–
he
is
not
employed
by
a
farmer
and
he…
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that’s
a
part
of
what
decides
it.
if
he
is
employed
by
a
farmer,
in
order
to
be
within,
the
little
truck
drivers
whether
they
are
employed
by
bayside
or
by
anybody
else,
if
they
are
working
entirely
on
the
farm
then
they
are
within
the
third
exemption.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no,
the
tanks,
bayside,
if
bayside…
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
it
is,
that’s
exactly
what
the
farmers
irrigation
company
said,
it
is
hard
to
raise
crops
without
water,
it's
hard
to
raise
chickens
without
water,
but
the
exemption,
the
primary
exemption
is
for
actual
farming
operations
and
delivering
water
or
delivering
feed
is
not
part
of
the
primary
exemption.
it's
an
incidental
necessary
operation.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
all
it
did
was
provide
an
essential
service
and
bayside
does
no
farming
itself.
they
contract
for
other
people
to
do
the
farming.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that’s
right,
but
certainly
the
feed
truck,
these
feed
truck
drivers
don’t
deliver
feed
to
those
farms…
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
that’s
true,
but
our
claim
as
we
explain
in
the
brief
is
that
the
kind
of
control…
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
and
that
the
kind
of
control
the
bayside
exercises
are
not
enough
and
one
of
the
reasons
for
that
we
didn’t
emphasize
in
our
brief
but
i
think
is
really
quite
important,
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
terms
of
the
agreement
between
bayside
and
its
farmers,
bayside
has
set
up
very
specific
specifications
about
the
product.
it
provides
the
product
and
it
indicates
how
they
want
the
product
grown,
but
it
says
nothing
about
the
labor
side
of
it.
it
doesn’t
say
anything
about
wages,
it
doesn’t
say
anything
about
hours,
it
doesn’t
say
anything
about
fringe
benefits,
it
certainly
doesn’t
say
anything
about
the
types
of
unsatisfactory
performance
that
are
going
to
lead
to
terminations
of
relationship.
although,
it
apparently
contemplates
that
the
farmers
are
going
to
hire
employees,
it
doesn’t
say
anything
about
the
conditions…
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that’s
precisely
what
it
suggests
and
it's
--
the
reason
that
i
think
that
it's
important
is
because
what
the
national
labor
relations
act
exemptions
are
concerned
with
is
that
the
farmer
should
be
free
to
set
the
conditions
of
employment
of
his
workers
without
complying
with
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
that’s
what
bayside
is
not
doing.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
if
they
have
employees
that
were
doing
the
farming,
but
they
don’t,
what
they
have
is
a,
what
they
have
is
basically,
a
requirement’s
contract.
they
have
got,
they
have
set
fairly
specific
specifications
for
the
product,
they
have
supplied
the
raw
materials,
they
say
this
is
the
way
we
want
the
raw
materials
put
together
and
we
will
pay
you
for
the
results
of
your
efforts,
but
how
you
put
the
product
together,
whether
you
hire
people
to
do
it
and
if
you
do,
under
what
terms
you
hire
people
to
do
it,
that’s
of
no
concern
to
us
and
it
is
on
the
basis
of
that
kind
of
an
agreement
that
they
are
seeking
to
avoid
the
requirements
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
regards
the
employees
that
they
have
where
they
do
set
the
terms
and
conditions
of
their
employment.
the
part
of
the
essence
of
their
arrangement
with
their
contract
farmers
is
that
they
are
out
of
the
very
area
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
concerned
with.
bayside’s
argument
that
the
statutory
exemption
covers
those
who
contract
for
others
to
do
the
actual
farming
ask
the
court
to
expand
the
statutory
definition
beyond
its
plain
meaning
and
beyond
the
decisions
of
the
court
interpreting
the
statute.
the
stretching
is
not
required
either
for
practical
business
reasons
or
to
treat
employers
and
employees
fairly.
the
statutory
definition
is
quite
precise.
congress
didn’t
simply
exempt
agricultural
labors
and
leave
it
to
the
courts
to
define
agriculture.
it
spelled
out
what
it
meant.
it
included
farming
and
all
its
branches
but
only
those
incidental
non
farming
operations
performed
by
the
farmer,
that
is
by
someone
engaged
in
actual
farming.
as
i
pointed
out,
the
court
held
in
farmers
irrigation
company
that
an
association
of
farmers
that
supplies
irrigation
water
to
its
member
farmers
is
not
itself
a
farmer
for
purposes
of
the
exemption.
supplying
of
necessary
services
to
farmers
does
not
make
you
a
farmer.
so,
even
though
bayside
supplies
necessary
materials
to
the
farmer
and
pays
him
for
the
results
of
his
efforts,
bayside
is
not
the
farmer.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no
it's
not.
it's
certainly
we
are
not
arguing
that
integration
makes
it
lose
its
character.
all
we
are
saying
is
that
when
you
have
got
a
complex
company,
what
you
have
to
do
is
look
at
what
its
doing
and
look
at
the
nature
of
the
contract
with
the
growers.
we
are
not
certainly
arguing
that
as
a
whole,
it
is
not
a
farm.
we
agree
that
there
are
parts
of
it
that
are
farming.
all
we
are
saying
is
that
in
its
relationships
with
the
growers
it
is
contracting
with
farmers.
certainly,
you
can
imagine
situations
in
which
bayside
would
have
its
own
farms
like
the
sugar
companies
do.
there
is
no,
it's
not
the
modernization
of
it
that
is
the
problem,
it
is
the
form
that
that
has
taken.
ms.

s.
shapiro
if
they
owned
and
operated
all
these
farms
then
as
i
said
before,
then
you
would
have
to
decide
whether
the
feedmill
was
incidental
to
the
operations
of
the
farm.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
that
is,
the
record
here
i
do
not
think
is
complete
enough,
then
you
go
to
the
questions
in…
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
in
order
to
answer
that
question
you
would
have
to
look
at
the
relationship
between
the
bayside’s
farming
operation
and
the
feedmill’s
and
the
waialua
case
tell
us
–
maze
out
certain
questions
that
you
asked
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
feedmill
is
incidental
to
bayside’s
farming
operations.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
they
would
be
incidental
–
our
position
is
that
they
would
be
incidental
to
the
feedmill,
but
once
you
–
that
is
i
think
quite
clear.
then,
the
next
question
is,
is
the
feedmill
incidental
to
bayside’s
farm
operations?
now,
the
court
below
and
in
our
brief
we
discussed
the
question
of
whether
the
feedmill
is
incidental
to
the
very
limited
farm
operations
that
we
agree
that
bayside
is
involved
in.
that
is
one
question.
your
question
would
be
whether
the
feedmill
is
incidental
to
the
much
larger
farm
operations
that
bayside
would
be
involved
in
your
case
and
that
is
–
you
are
having
it
incidental
to
a
different
unit
and
that
is
a
different
question.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no,
the
court
–
the
board
found
and
the
court
agreed
that
it
was
one
unit.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no,
it
really
does
not.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
whether
bayside’s
relationship
with
the
contract
growers
is
really
makes
them
a
farmer.
the
only
two
points
i
wanted
to
emphasize
in
addition
are
that
there
is
no
practical
business
reasons
which
require
treating
bayside
as
a
unit.
in
fact,
some
of
the
bayside’s
truck
drivers
are
unionized,
represented
by
the
union,
so
they
clearly
are
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
bayside
does
not
contend
otherwise.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
those
are
the
truck
drivers
that
go
onto
the
farms
and
get
the
chickens
and
take
them
to
the
processing
plant.
they
belong
to
the
same
bargaining
union
as
the
members
of
the
processing
plant.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no,
so
this…
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
oh
yeah,
they
are
employees
and
the
other
point
i
wanted
to
make
was
that
there
is
no
considerations
of
fairness
that
require
you
to
find
these
truck
drivers,
agricultural
workers.
we
certainly
–
our
point
is
that,
people
that
are
performing
similar
work,
the
agriculture
–
the
workers
on
bayside’s
own
farms
and
any
employees
of
the
growers
are
clearly,
they
are
doing
the
same
kind
of
work,
they
are
both
are
agricultural
workers,
they
are
both
within
the
exemption.
bayside
also
has
a
–
the
truck
driver
that
delivers
the
feed
to
the
independent
farms,
he
is
not
an
agricultural
worker.
he
is
doing
the
same
kind
of
work
as
these
truck
drivers
here
are.
so,
fairness
considerations,
they
should
be
treated
the
way
people
are
working
during
some
of
their
work.
thank
you.
