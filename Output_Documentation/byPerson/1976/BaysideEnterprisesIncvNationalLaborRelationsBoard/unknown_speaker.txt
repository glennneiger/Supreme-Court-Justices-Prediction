unknown
speaker
when
you
say
this
typical
of
this
particular
industry,
do
you
--
would
you
distinguish
that
from
large
commercial
farming
operations
generally,
as
they
have
changed
from
the
old
traditional
patterns?
unknown
speaker
the
tax
court
decision,
that
is
not
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
could
you
give
us
the
citation
again.
unknown
speaker
how
in
this
case
are
the
farmers
compensated,
they
have
given
a
straight
payment
an
addition,
a
bonus
if,
what
the
chickens
are
of
a
certain
quality
and
size?
unknown
speaker
a24
of
what?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
does
the
bonus
depend
in
anyway
on
the
price
obtained?
unknown
speaker
cost
wise…
unknown
speaker
in
terms
of
quality
and/or
weight,
weight
reflects
quality
and
the
non
bonus
payment
does
not
depend
in
anyway
on
what
was
obtained
in
the
market
for
the
bird?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
chickens
that
die
who
takes
the
risk
of
that.
unknown
speaker
owns
the
chicken,
but
was
if
they
die
as
a
result
of
the
negligence
of
the
farmer?
unknown
speaker
you
just
get
another
contractor
next
time.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
would
there
be
any
question
about
the
exemption
if
there
was
full
integration
in
the
sense
that
the
company
didn’t
make
arrangements
with
growers
but
did
it
itself?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
i
know,
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
well
let
me
ask
you
the
question
in
another
way,
maybe
you
would
not
have
time
to
answer
before
lunch
but,
what’s
the
--
perhaps
you
could
explain
that
i
have
missed
it
--
why
does
a
company
arrange
its
affairs
this
way?
is
there
some
obvious
tax
advantage
or
some
liability
advantage
or…
unknown
speaker
and
this
was
not
an
accident.
unknown
speaker
the
way
of
doing
business
has
evolved
for
a
reason,
that’s
what
i
mean.
unknown
speaker
you
can
respond
to
that
at
1
o’clock.
unknown
speaker
you
have
about
six
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
business
reason
for
it?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
very
informative….
unknown
speaker
i
agree
with
you
that,
let
us
just
say
what
is
this,
but
why
do
you
suppose,
at
least
they
still
would
have
a
choice
of
doing
it
themselves
or
doing
it
this
way?
unknown
speaker
so,
if
the
risk
is
part
of
it,
does
risk
shifting
matter
to
the
grower?
unknown
speaker
but,
it
also
i
suppose
for
all
sorts
of
--
for
no
purpose
are
these
farmers
employees
of
your
client.
unknown
speaker
are
they?
unknown
speaker
yes,
then
for
any
other
purposes
for
which
it
might
be
important.
they
are
not
employee.
unknown
speaker
and
they
don’t
withhold
or….
unknown
speaker
how
about
court
liability?
unknown
speaker
how
about
court
liability?
unknown
speaker
is
your
client
liable
for
any
torts
that
might
be
committed
by
these
farmers?
unknown
speaker
but
i
(inaudible)
when
you
go
into
processing
plants
you
lose
three
things,
your
head,
your
insides
and
your
feathers.
unknown
speaker
we
know
that
don’t
we?
unknown
speaker
and
he
stopped
growing
didn’t
they?
unknown
speaker
once
you
get
to
the
processing
plant
that
is
it.
unknown
speaker
but
these
independent
contractors
are
the
ones
who
grow
the
chicken.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
what
does
your
client
do
to
grow
on?
unknown
speaker
but
does
growing
occur
on
the
independent
contractors’
farms.
unknown
speaker
is
the
chicken
grows.
unknown
speaker
he
does
not
clean
up
the
pan?
unknown
speaker
how
do
they
get
clean?
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about
during
the
nine
week
period.
unknown
speaker
during
the
growing
period.
unknown
speaker
i
like
the
word
grow,
would
you
doubt?
unknown
speaker
you
wanted
to
save
anything
for
rebuttal?
i
think
we
have
cross
examines
your
good
picture.
unknown
speaker
would
you
like
to
say?
we
will
add
three
minutes
to
your
time
and
then
add
three
minutes
to
your
opponent’s
time.
unknown
speaker
mrs.
shapiro.
unknown
speaker
now,
the
chicken
farmer
said
he
has
owned
the
truck
and
send
the
truck
over
to
a
feedmill
owned
by
somebody
else
and
whole
feed
back.
that
would
be
incidental
to
farming,
i
suppose
would
not
it?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
--
if
those
are
getting
drifted
into
bayside
of
the
farm
to
raise
the
chickens
themselves.
unknown
speaker
the
truck
drivers
running
back
and
forth
between
the
various
plans
and
those
particular
farms.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
had
already
said
that
here’s
a
farmer
that
owns
the
trucks
that
goes
to
the
feedmill.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
it
might,
if
a
farmer
sends
his
truck
to
an
independent
feedmill
his
truck
drivers
are
exempted,
but
if
he
had
zoned
the
feedmill
do
they
earn?
unknown
speaker
well,
mrs.
shapiro,
let
me
add
a
question
along
with
just
so,
what
is
it
in
the
statute
that
requires,
that
permits
even
the
compartmentalization
that
you
insist
on,
that
you
have
to
say
in
its
capacity
as
a
feedmill
operator
and
the
capacity
as
a
breeder
farmer
and
that
sort
of
thing?
unknown
speaker
your
analysis
has
the
ring
of
the
set
of
regulations.
are
there
any
regulations
that
support
these
compartments
that
you
have
made?
unknown
speaker
but
mrs.
shapiro
definitely
the
wording
of
3(f)
of
the
1938
act,
fair
labor
standards
act
has
not
changed
has
it?
isn’t
that
the
same
as
it
was
originally?
unknown
speaker
but
the
appropriations
acts
reincorporated
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
almost
annually
do
not
they?
unknown
speaker
do
the
regulations
taken
to
account
at
all
of
these
differences
in
methods
of
farming?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
i
appreciate
that.
are
they
carried
into
the
works
of
agricultural
employee
for
the
purposes
of
the
national
labor
relations
act?
unknown
speaker
the
handling
has
been
--
unknown
speaker
and
have
the
regulations
been
revised
that
much?
unknown
speaker
do
the
regulation
defends
themselves
to
this
form
of
farming
operations
directly?
unknown
speaker
the
board
follows
that
interpretation?
unknown
speaker
an
enterprise
that
does
run
that
limited
farming
operation
itself.
you
can
see
that
the
employees
engaged
in
that
activities
are
exact
as
agricultural
laborers.
unknown
speaker
does
the
feedmill
sell
to
anybody
except
bayside
people?
unknown
speaker
it
did
so
as
commercial
and
the
people
have
no
connection
with
it?
unknown
speaker
then
it
is
independent
of
bayside?
unknown
speaker
even
today?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
i
recall
something
on
the
papers
to
the
effect
that
that
has
been
done
away
with.
unknown
speaker
mrs.
shapiro,
if
your
opponent
is
right
on
what
is
a
farm
and
if
you
are
right
on
the
point
that
the
drivers
are
incidental
to
the
feed
mill
operation…
unknown
speaker
what
employees
would
we
be
fighting
about?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see,
because
if
you
could,
what
if
the
feedmill
operation
is
incidental
to
a
farm,
would
it
then
follow
the
drivers
who
are
engaged
in
working
in
incidental
department?
unknown
speaker
i
am
asking
the
question
just
a
little
differently,
if
we
concluded
that
the
feedmill
was
an
industrial
operation
and
not
incidental
farming,
but
if
the
growing
was
farming
by
bayside,
would
there
be
any
employees
that
would
be
fighting
about
than
these
drivers?
i
mean,
is
the
whole
fight
just
over
these
drivers
or
there
are
other
employees
that
are
involved
in
any
way?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
mrs.
shapiro
the
regulation
which
you
referred
at
page
18
of
your
brief
78126,
does
that
description
that
goes
back
to
1961
i
gather
doesn’t
it?
that
insert
with
the
bulletin,
that’s
the
wage
in
our
division.
does
that
description
precisely
fit
the
facts
of
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
my
next
question
is
that
the
--
this
of
course
is
a
wage
in
our
division,
interpretive
bulletin,
has
it
been
followed
and
adopted
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
any
cases?
unknown
speaker
in
addition
to
this
one,
i
mean?
unknown
speaker
well,
really
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at
is,
remember
we
didn’t
get
these
briefings
so
just
the
other
day
so,
i
haven’t
had
a
chance
to
study
this
so,
as
i
would
like.
what
i
am
trying
to
find
out
is,
has
that
actual
regulation
been
applied
by
the
national
labor
relations
board,
because
you
make
an
argument
that
this
has
entitled
a
great
way
in
interpreting
the
statute
since
this
is
the
agency
charged
with
this
type
of
statute,
but
what's
unique
about
this
is
this
interpret
of
bulletin
is
on
a
national
labor
relations
board
book.
it’s
a
wage
in
our
division
board.
unknown
speaker
so,
my
question
is
has
the
board
applied
this
regulation
in
any
other
case?
unknown
speaker
and
are
they
cited
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
and
it
avoids
having
to
treat
them
as
employees?
unknown
speaker
and
then,
let
me
ask
you,
i
go
back
to
–
suppose
a
farmer
is
growing
chickens
and
he
is
sending
his
own
truck
out
to
get
feed
to
bring
it
back.
now,
the
statute
exempts
farming
as
things
that
are
part
of
farming.
now,
why
wouldn’t
during
feed,
what
could
be
more
integral
to
the
operation
of
growing
chickens
and
then
feeding
them?
i
mean,
you
are
not
going
to
grow
many
chickens
unless
you
feed
them.
so,
why
wouldn’t
you
say
that,
calling
your
feed
to
your
chickens
is
a
part
of
farming,
not
incidental
it's
just
part
of
farming?
unknown
speaker
let’s
suppose
that
you
are
a
chicken
grower
and
you
hire
30
people
to
unload
the
feed
trucks
and
actually
go
out
and
feed
the
chickens,
is
that
part
of
farming?
unknown
speaker
alright,
now
suppose
the
farmer
who
instead
of
hiring
his
own
employees
to
feed
the
chickens
for
him,
contracts
with
the
chicken
feeder
and
they
send
their
employees
in
and
they
feed
the
–
do
exactly
the
same
thing
as
his
employees
used
to
do,
that’s
also
a
part
of
farming
actually.
unknown
speaker
oh
no,
i
am
just
suggesting,
why
isn’t
that
part
of
farming?
if
it
was
yesterday
why
isn’t
it
today?
they
are
exactly
the
same
activity.
unknown
speaker
if
you
take
farming
apart,
nothing
is
farming.
it's
all
incidental.
unknown
speaker
40
years
ago
mrs.
shapiro
or
60
perhaps,
were
all
these
things
done
by
what
they
called
the
hired
hands
and
used
the
team
horses
and
a
wagon
instead
of
modern
truck
and
maybe
a
uniform?
what’s
the
fundamental
difference
in
his
function,
from
the
hired
man
of
that
day,
to
this
person
that
justice
white
was
describing?
unknown
speaker
yes,
the
court
said
that
in
several
cases…
unknown
speaker
a
big
commercial
farm
might
have
and
validly
does
have
today
a
lot
of
this
very
sophisticated
equipment
to
the
point
where
they
might
have
their
own
machine
shop
to
repair
them
whereas
again,
50
years
ago
the
man
who
would
ram
the
steam
rig
also
repaired
it
off
season.
are
these
men
who
maintain
this
machinery
on
the
modern
commercial
farm?
are
they
–
which
category
do
you
say
they
are
in?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
distinguish
them
from
the
gentleman
that
justice
white
was
describing?
unknown
speaker
not
necessarily.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
were
two
types
of
trucks,
one
big
one
would
bring
20
tons
of
seed
bags
then
little
trucks
would
deliver
it
around
within
the
farm,
would
those
little
ones
be
alright?
unknown
speaker
no,
one
may
have
ten
trucks
owned
by
the
farm.
unknown
speaker
are
they
engaged
in
farming?
unknown
speaker
once
again,
the
big
truck
as
a
little
truck?
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
the
little
truck
driver
is
employed
by
the
farm
and
the
big
truck
driver
is
employed
by
bayside.
unknown
speaker
i
can't
get
it,
is
that
employment
what
decides
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
if
the
bayside
was
delivering
the
tanks
of
water,
any
difference?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
all
farms
raise
chickens
without
water?
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
farmers
ditch
company,
the
ditch
company
that
was
claiming
under
the
exemption
did
absolutely
no
farming
itself,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can
see
that
some
–
they
do
some
farming
and
then
they
go
in
the
brief.
unknown
speaker
but
the
waialua
company
didn’t
control
the
farming
operation
either.
the
farming
wasn’t
done
in
accordance
with
their
specifications
and
under
their
direction.
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
claim
is
valid
and
enough.
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn’t
that
suggest,
almost
a
lessor-lessee
relationship
that
you
are
asking
for
a
certain
property
and
certain
conditions
from
the
lessor
and
you
don’t
care
how
he
goes
about
providing
it?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
is
a
lessor-lessee
relationship
doesn’t
that
strengthen
bayside’s
claim
that
if
rather
than
the
contract
farmers
is
doing
the
farming,
if
bayside
had
simply
leased
land
from
the
same
contract
farmers
and
agreed
to
pay
them
at
the
same
rate
for
their
land,
clearly
bayside
will
be
doing
that
farming
wouldn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
i
get
a
feeling
mrs.
shapiro
that
the
government’s
position
as
you
articulated
is
that
when
the
total
farming
operation
became
subdivided
and
compartmentalized
resembling
the
methods
of
modern
business
in
order
to
achieve
greater
efficiency
that
somehow
or
other
the
more
efficient
function
loses
its
character
as
farming.
unknown
speaker
well,
mrs.
shapiro
suppose
bayside
had
owned
all
of
these
farms
and
operated
them,
they
would
still
be
under
the
same
legislative
decision,
would
not
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
asking
you
would
it
be?
unknown
speaker
in
my
record
is,
if
bayside
has
a
hundred
farms
which
they
run,
operate,
finance,
own,
pay
taxes
on,
etcetera
and
the
feedmill
and
everything
else
is
just
the
same.
would
those
trucks
be
in
the
farming
business
or
the
processing
business?
unknown
speaker
the
only
difference
in
my
hypothetical
is,
that
bayside
owns
the
farms
and
operates,
that
is
the
only
difference.
everything
else
is
different.
where
were
those
trucks
the
process
or
farm?
unknown
speaker
does
it
make
any
difference
in
this
case
that
the
feedmill
was
owned
by
a
subsidiary?
unknown
speaker
does
it
make
any
difference
that
a
small
percentage
of
the
feedmill’s
product
was
sold
to
outsiders?
unknown
speaker
so,
it
would
be
the
same
if
the
feedmill,
say
were
owned
directly
and
were
located
on
property
owned
by
bayside
and
just
entire
--
but
went
for
this
chicken
farming
operations?
you
still
have
the
issue
in
your
view
as
to
whether
or
not
the
work
of
the
truck
drivers
was
incidental
to
a
farming
function.
unknown
speaker
what
function
do
they
perform
or
do
they
have?
unknown
speaker
and
there
has
never
been
a
claim
to
their
agricultural
work?
unknown
speaker
and
they
are
employees,
they
are
not
independent
contractors?
unknown
speaker
alright,
well,
mrs.
shapiro
you
have
few
minutes
left
to…
