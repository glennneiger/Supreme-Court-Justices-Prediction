mr.
george
a.
nilson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
george
nilson;
i
am
a
deputy
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
maryland
and
i
am
here
on
behalf
of
the
appellants
to
argue
in
favor
of
the
constitutionality
of
maryland’s
filing
deadline
for
independent
candidates
seeking
a
place
on
maryland’s
general
election
ballot.
appellee,
bruce
bradley,
an
unsuccessful
independent
candidate
for
the
united
states
senate
and
his
supporters,
contend
that
the
deadline
is
so
far
ahead
of
the
election
that
it
infringes
on
their
rights
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
three-judge
court
below
agreed
feeling
bound
by
this
court’s
summary
affirmance
of
the
three-judge
court
decision
in
salera
versus
tucker
out
of
pennsylvania.
as
in
most
other
states,
the
bulk
of
the
candidates
who
appear
on
maryland’s
general
election
ballot,
do
so
as
a
consequence
of
their
success
in
the
party
primary
elections.
primary
elections
are
held
by
each
political
party
with
which
10%
or
more
of
the
state's
registered
voters
are
affiliated.
other
candidates
who
wish
to
have
their
names
appear
on
the
general
election
ballot
must
file
nominating
petitions
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
set
fourth
in
section
7-1
of
article
33
of
the
maryland
code.
those
requirements
can
be
summarized
as
follows:
first,
the
petitions
must
be
signed
by
3%
of
the
registered
voters
eligible
to
vote
for
the
office
in
question,
determined
as
four
months
prior
to
the
primary
election.
second,
and
this
is
the
element
upon
which
the
court
below
focused,
the
nominating
petitions
must
be
filed
by
the
same
date
on
which
party
primary
candidates
must
file
their
certificates
of
candidacy.
that
is
70
days
before
the
primary
election.
this
results
in
an
early
march
deadline
in
presidential
election
years
when
the
primaries
are
held
in
may,
and
in
early
july
deadline
in
other
years
when
the
primaries
are
held
in
september.
next,
the
nominating
petitions
maybe
circulated
and
signed
at
any
time
prior
to
the
deadline.
there
is
no
gathering
period
restriction
like
those
which
have
been
present
in
other
cases
in
this
area
previously
considered
by
this
court,
nor
is
there
a
gathering
period
restriction
similar
to
the
one
that
was
present
in
the
salera
case.
next,
persons
who
wish
to
vote
in
the
primary
election
or
not
prohibited
from
doing
so
are
having
signed
a
nominating
petition
on
behalf
of
an
independent
candidate,
and
petitions
signers
need
not
state
their
intention
to
vote
for
the
candidate
whose
petition
they
signed.
and
finally,
unlike
the
case
and
the
situation
in
some
other
states
petitions
maybe
circulated
by
non-residence
and
person
is
not
registered
in
maryland
and
the
individual
voters
signatures
need
not
be
no
notarized.
the
challenge
in
this
case
and
the
opinion
of
lower
court
which
we
seek
to
reverse,
focused
entirely
on
a
filling
deadline
of
70
days
before
the
primary
election,
and
particularly
on
that
deadline
as
it
operates
in
a
presidential
election
year
where
it
occurs
in
early
march.
in
this
case
on
the
march
8,
1976
deadline
established
by
the
maryland
statute,
mr.
bradley
filed
a
number
of
signatures
which,
if
they
had
all
been
valid
signatures
of
registered
voters,
would
have
been
sufficient
to
satisfy
maryland’s
3%
requirement
within
the
statutory
deadline.
however
more
than
20%
of
those
signatures
proved
to
be
invalid
and
when
mr.
bradley
was
left
in
outer
place
on
the
maryland
ballot,
he
filed
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court.
he
argued
below
and
he
argues
to
this
court
that
maryland’s
early
filing
deadline,
as
he
characterizes
it,
denies
an
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
unreasonably
infringes
upon
his
first
amendment
rights
and
those
of
the
voters
who
would
support
him.
he
succeeded
in
persuading
the
three-judge
court
below
that
maryland’s
deadline
falls
too
far
in
advance
of
the
general
election
and
lacks
sufficient
supporting
state
interest,
and
therefore
infringes
upon
his
constitutional
rights.
in
essence,
he
persuaded
the
lower
court
that
its
decision
in
this
case
was
controlled,
absolutely
controlled
by
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
court
in
the
pennsylvania
case
of
salera
versus
tucker
which
was
similarly
affirmed
by
this
court
earlier
this
year.
based
upon
its
reading
of
the
summary
affirmance
in
salera
v.
tucker
the
three-judge
court
below
granted
mr.
bradley
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief.
with
the
benefit
of
the
additional
time
allowed
him
by
the
lower
court
he
went
on
to
become
a
candidate
albeit
an
unsuccessful
one
in
the
general
election
of
1976.
this
appeal
followed
the
granting
of
relief
by
the
lower
court
and
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
in
october.
while
the
case
is
now
before
the
court
for
plenary
consideration
on
its
merits
and
while
this
court
thus
need
not
concern
itself
with
the
significance
of
its
prior
summary
affirmances
to
quite
the
degree
as
lower
courts
must.
we
have
argued
in
our
briefs
that
the
lower
court
here
substantially
must
apply
the
teachings
of
hicks
versus
miranda
and
its
progeny
with
respect
to
the
significance
of
prior
summary
dispositions
by
the
supreme
court.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
correct
it
did,
but
i
believe
the
tully
case
subsequent
to
hicks
versus
miranda
strongly
indicate,
if
not
clearly
holds,
that
summary
affirmances
from
three-judge
court
decision
would
be
treated
the
same
way
and
accorded
the
same
weight
that
--
mr.
george
a.
nilson
at
least
as
much.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
correct,
but
i
do
not
believe
prior
to
hicks
versus
miranda,
it
had
been
clearly
established
just
what
the
import
of
summary
affirmances
was
either,
and
i
think
even
after
hicks
versus
miranda
there
were
some
commentators
who
argued
that
there
was
still
a
distinction
and
that
perhaps
summary
affirmances
were
not
entitled
quite
as
much
weight
as
the
hicks
kind
of
summary
disposition,
but
i
think
that
the
tully
decision
of
this
court
places
the
two
equal
footing.
the
lower
court,
we
submit,
the
error
that
it
made
was
to
adopt
a
particular
reading
of
the
lower
court’s
decision
in
salera
v.
tucker,
and
assume
that
this
court
summarily
affirm
the
decision
in
that
case,
in
the
salera
case
on
precisely
the
same
analytical
grounds
which
the
court
below
thought
what
had
been
applied
by
the
lower
court
in
salera.
the
pennsylvania
statutory
scheme
death
within
salera,
required
independent
candidates
to
gather
their
nominating
petition
signatures
within
a
three
week
period
ending
49
days
before
the
primary
election
and
either
218
or
244
days
before
the
general
election
depending
upon
whether
it
was
a
presidential
election
year
or
not.
the
salera
court
felt
ban
to
uphold
the
three
week
gathering
period
in
light
of
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
storer
versus
brown,
upholding
on
its
face,
a
24-day
gathering
period
in
california.
i
would
submit
that
the
salera
court
was
wrong
in
that
respect,
particularly
and
so
far
as
it
examined
the
gathering
period
by
itself.
having
thus
upheld,
that
short
gathering
period,
feeling
compelled
to
do
so.
the
salera
court
then
went
on
to
invalidate
the
pennsylvania
requirement
with
signature
gathering
staff
and
all
petitions
be
filed
49
days
before
the
primary
election.
the
lower
court
here
chose
to
read
salera
as
treating
these
two
requirements
gathering
period
and
deadline
as
separate
and
distinct
from
one
another,
and
assumed
that
this
court
likewise
view
them
a
separate
and
distinct
in
summarily
affirming.
we
would
submit
that
such
a
reading
of
salera
is
not
correct
and
would
be
clearly
contrary
the
analytical
approach
established
for
these
kinds
of
constitutional
questions
by
this
court’s
written
opinions
in
williams
versus
rhodes,
jenness
versus
fortson,
american
party
of
texas
versus
white
and
storer
versus
brown.
we
believe
that
the
jurisdictional
statement
in
salera
then
as
it
was
properly
presented
to
this
court,
the
question
of
whether
a
three
week
signature
gathering
period
in
conjunction
with
an
early
deadline
was
unconstitutional.
we
further
submit
that
the
proper
way
to
read
this
court’s
summary
affirmance
in
salera
is
as
a
holding
of
the
combination
of
such
a
limited
signature
gathering
period
and
an
early
filing
deadline
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
right
sir.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
prior
to
the
lunch
and
break
i
was
discussing
salera
versus
tucker
in
the
summary
affirmance,
and
had
noted
that
the
jurisdictional
statement
in
that
case
then
as
it
was
had
properly
presented
to
this
court,
the
question
of
whether
a
three
week
signature
gathering
period
taken
in
conjunction
with
an
early
deadline
was
unconstitutional.
we
further
submit
that
the
proper
way
to
read
this
court’s
summary
affirmance
in
salera
is
as
a
holding
that
the
combination
of
such
a
limited
signature
gathering
period
and
an
early
filing
deadline
is
unconstitutional.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
this
result.
we
believe
that
it
is
consistent
with
the
prior
written
opinions
of
this
court
to
which
i
referred
prior
to
the
break.
however,
such
a
result
in
no
way
compels
or
even
suggests
a
conclusion
of
maryland’s
filing
deadline
unaccompanied
as
it
is
by
any
limitation
on
the
period
during
which
signatures
might
be
gathered
or
by
any
other
significant
restriction
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
about
running
again?
to
the
extent
that
he
continues
to
desire
to
seek
the
united
states
senate,
there
are
no
present
election
campaigns.
i
do
not
believe
he
has
made
any
statement
that
i
am
aware
of
is
certainly
not
on
the
record
in
this
case
as
to
whether
he
will
or
will
not.
i
believe
he
did
indicate
during
a
campaign
that
he
was…
this
was
not
just
a
one
shot
foray
within
the
politics.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
pardon
me.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
i
do
not
believe
the
case
is
moot.
i
think
this
court’s
opinions
on
mootness,
especially
in
the
context
of
election
cases,
make
it
clear
that
the
case
is
not
moot.
we
have
a
statute
that
has
been
declared
unconstitutional,
admittedly
the
election
is
over
but
mr.
bradley,
as
far
as
we
know
and
the
record
indicates
nothing
to
the
contrary.
he
is
in
politics
to
stay
and
will
again
be
an
independent
candidate
or
if
he
is
candidate
again
he
would
be
an
independent
one.
i
think
as
i
say
storer
versus
brown
discusses
the
mootness
question.
the
mootness
principles
are
also
discussed
in
the
lower
court
opinion
in
salera
and
i
think
all
of
these
cases.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
it
is
the
kind
of
situation
which
is
likely
to
recur
again
with
the
filing
deadline
and
yet
will
be
susceptible
of
the
waiting
review.
i
think
the
opinion
in
storer
indicates
clearly
the
reasons
why
in
these
kinds
of
cases
they
should
not
be
considered
moot.
it
will
resolve
the
challenges
and
question
prior
to
next
selection
so
that
we
do
not
have
last
minute
cases
brought
up
again
on
the
eve
of
the
election
as
was
the
case
here
and
i
think
--
mr.
george
a.
nilson
pardon
me.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
there
would
be
another
case,
i
am
sure.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
but
i
think
al
least
it
is
important
to
resolve
the
constitutional
status
by
this
court
now
that
we
are
here
with
respect
to
the
filing
deadline
under
maryland
law.
i
might
add
that
the
lower
court’s
opinion
added
an
element
of
uncertainly
even
beyond
the
particular
holding
in
that
case
by
indicating
or
suggesting
that
perhaps
mr.
bradley
was
entitled
to
even
more
relief
than
effectively
a
primary
deadline
in
addition
to
the
analysis
of
the
lower
court
that
was
applied
to
our
statute,
raises
serious
questions
even
about
the
modification
of
the
statute
that
mr.
bradley
has
suggested
in
his
brief.
an
examination
of
the
primary
written
opinions
of
this
court
which
control
the
outcome
of
this
case,
williams
versus
rhodes,
jenness
versus
fortson,
american
party
of
texas
v.
white
and
storer
v.
brown
enable
us
to
identify
certain
basic
principles
which
were
to
be
applied.
first,
generally
speaking
where
state
ballot
access
laws
are
challenge
they
should
be
considered
in
their
totality,
and
individual
provisions
at
least
where
they
interact
with
one
another
and
relate
to
one
another
should
not
be
singled
out
and
treated
in
isolation.
the
exception
for
an
individual
or
single
factor
which
does
not
interact
as
discussed
in
this
court’s
opinion
in
storer
versus
brown
and
clearly
is
not
applicable
in
the
present
situation.
secondly,
the
first
amendment
and
equal
protection
analysis
merged
and
in
the
context
of
requirements
imposed
upon
independent
candidates
boil
down
to
two
related
tests.
first,
do
ballot
access
requirements
constitute
--
and
i
am
quoting
from
this
court’s
prior
opinions,
“insurmountable
obstacles”
or
“suffocating
restrictions”
which
make
it
impossible
or
impractical
for
an
independent
to
gain
a
place
on
the
ballot
or
do
they
provide
a
feasible
opportunity
for
reasonably
diligent
independents
to
run?
secondly,
do
they
promote
a
substantial
imbalance
in
the
relative
difficulty
for
independents
and
primary
candidates?
in
other
words
are
they
inherently
or
invidiously
more
burdensome
as
to
independents.
in
resolving
the
issue
of
the
substantiality
or
discriminatory
nature
of
the
ballot
access
requirements,
this
court’s
opinions
instruct
us
to
examine
actual
experience
in
the
state
in
question
as
a
principle
guide.
substantial
burdens
and
discriminations
maybe
justified
even
if
they
exists
if
they
serve
compelling
state
interest.
if
they
are
--
and
again
i
am
quoting
form
american
party
of
texas
v.
white,
“reasonably
imposed
in
pursuit
of
vital
state
objectives
that
can
not
be
served
equally
well
in
significantly
less
burdensome
ways.”
with
respect
to
compelling
interest
this
court
has
established
that
the
states
have
a
compelling
interest
in
preserving
the
integrity
of
the
electoral
process
and
regulating
the
number
of
candidates
on
the
ballot
to
avoid
undo
voter
confusion.
they
are
free
to
assure
themselves
that
a
candidate
is
a
serious
contender
with
a
significant
level
of
community
support.
this
court’s
opinions
also
established
that
it
is
a
legitimate
and
compelling
interest
on
party
of
the
state
to
provide
parody
of
treatment
and
fix
identical
deadlines
for
primary
and
independent
candidates
respectively.
and
finally,
it
is
clearly
permissible
to
provide
different
routes
to
the
printed
ballot,
so
long
as
they
are
not
substantially
unequal
in
their
difficultly.
in
applying
these
principles
this
court
has
only
once
invalidated
a
state
ballot
access
regulatory
scheme
in
a
written
opinion
and
that
was
williams
versus
rhodes
where
this
court
invalidated
the
ohio
scheme
calling
for
15%
of
the
voters
to
sign
petitions
on
behalf
of
the
parties
by
february
7th
in
the
election
year
and
required
these
parties,
these
lesser
parties,
to
develop
an
extensive
party
organization
and
engage
in
other
organizational
activities
prior
to
this
february
7th
deadline.
conversely
in
storer
versus
brown
a
24-day
gathering
period
was
facially
upheld,
coupled
with
a
5%
signature
requirement.
although
the
case
was
remanded
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
the
number
of
voters,
the
question
involving
the
number
of
voters
who
would
be
disqualified
from
signing
nominating
petitions
by
their
participation
in
primary
elections.
in
the
american
party
case
a
deadline
of
120
days
before
general
election
was
upheld,
coupled
with
a
55-day
gathering
period
and
requirements
as
high
as
5%
depending
on
the
office,
together
with
a
disqualification
of
primary
voters
from
signing
nominating
petitions.
and
finally
and
perhaps
most
importantly,
in
jenness
versus
fortson
a
deadline
of
69
days
before
the
primary
and
150
days
before
the
general
election
was
upheld,
even
though
coupled
with
a
6-month
gathering
period
and
a
5%
requirement.
the
georgia
law,
upheld
in
jenness,
was
either
the
same
as
or
more
stringent
than
the
maryland
law
here
at
issue
in
every
single
respect
except
that
here
the
deadline
occurs
approximately
three
months
earlier
in
a
presidential
election
year,
three
months
more
prior
to
the
general
election.
this
court’s
summary
affirmances
of
lower
court
decisions
upholding
ballot
access
restrictions
are
entirely
consistent
with
these
written
opinions.
in
socialist
labor
party
versus
rhodes
which
was
summarily
affirmed
by
this
court
is
sweetenham
versus
gilligan.
the
issue
was
squarely
presented
to
this
court
as
to
the
validity
of
what
was
then
ohio’s
9-month
deadline,
nine
months
before
the
general,
90
days
before
the
primary.
that
case
was
summarily
affirmed.
in
pratt
v.
begley,
another
summary
affirmance
where
this
court
was
squarely
presented
with
the
issue
of
weather,
of
the
validity
of
a
55-day
pre-primary,
7-month
pre-general
deadline.
again
pratt
v.
begley
was
summarily
affirmed.
jackson
versus
ogilvie,
also
involving
a
pre-primary
deadline
and
a
5%
requirement,
again
similarly
affirmed.
auerbach
versus
mandel,
maryland’s
people
party
versus
mandel
and
wood
v.
putterman,
all
dealing
to
one
degree
to
another
with
the
precise
nominating
requirements
now
before
this
court
with
all
three
lower
court
opinions
upholding
the
law
in
the
early
70’s
and
being
summarily
affirmed
by
this
court.
notwithstanding
the
lower
court’s
dismissal
here
of
these
three
summary
affirmances
involving
the
precise
same
statute
we
are
now
presented
with,
we
submit
that
those
cases
did
raise
the
constitutional
question
now
presented.
they
were
clearly
posed
in
the
jurisdictional
statements,
at
least
in
auerbach
and
peoples
party,
and
auerbach
was
later
cited
in
storer
versus
brown
at
footnote
10
as
constituting
a
prior
approval
by
this
court
of
maryland’s
3%
nominating
requirement.
against
disarray
of
authority
the
sole
liberation
is
salera
versus
tucker
as
construed
by
the
lower
court
here
and
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court
here.
while
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
result
in
salera,
as
i
have
indicated
earlier,
we
believe
its
reasoning
as
perceived
by
the
lower
court
was
clearly
wrong
and
inconsistent
with
the
analytical
framework
previously
established
by
this
court.
never
before
has
a
filing
deadline
been
stricken
in
isolation
and
standing
by
itself.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
correct,
the
lower
court’s
opinion
--
mr.
george
a.
nilson
he
was
indeed
familiar
with
it.
if
he
was
not
of
course
familiar
with
precisely,
except
in
terms
of
reading
the
jurisdictional
statement,
with
precisely
what
was
presented
to
this
court
and
that
the
deliberations
of
this
court
involved
in
dealing
with
auerbach.
but
i
think
in
examination
of
the
opinion,
even
thought
it
may
have
been
authored
by
judge
winter,
of
the
opinion
in
auerbach
and
the
papers
presented
to
this
court
reflect
a
clear
presentation
of
the
constitutional
issue
to
this
court
in
auerbach.
i
think
our
view
of
that
is
enhanced
or
supported
by
the
citation
of
auerbach
as
a
case
on
the
merits
upholding
the
3%
requirement,
and
such
a
citation
was
made
in
storer
versus
brown
in
the
written
opinion
of
this
court
in
storer.
in
so
far
as
salera
was
relevant
to
the
lower
court
here
and
is
relevant
to
this
court
now
it
should
be
viewed
only
a
standing
for
the
proposition
that
the
combination
of
a
limited
3-week
gathering
period
and
a
relatively
early
filing
deadline
pose
too
substantial
barrier
to
independent
candidacies,
and
that
this
combination
is
not
sufficiently
supported
by
the
state
interest
which
were
discussed
in
salera,
which
were
more
limited
than
the
ones
presented
here
and
discussed
in
this
case.
regardless
of
the
alternative
way
in
which
one
could
read
the
lower
court’s
opinions
in
salera,
the
view
just
described
of
the
consequence
of
this
court’s
summary
affirmance
here
is
the
only
way
to
avoid
a
fundamental
conflict
between
the
salera
case
and
this
court’s
prior
written
opinions
and
summary
affirmances.
this
court’s
opinion
in
fusari
versus
steinberg,
as
well
as
the
chief
justice’s
concurring
opinion
in
that
case,
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
brennan
in
colorado
springs
amusements,
and
the
dissenting
opinions
of
mr.
justices
brennan
and
marshall
in
sidle
versus
majors
clearly
indicate
that
the
lower
courts
have
an
obligation
to
construe
some
re-affirmances
in
way
in
which
to
the
extent
possible
day
or
consistent
with
one
another
and
not
contrary
to
this
court’s
prior
written
decisions.
that
obligation
was
not
fulfilled
by
the
court
below.
view
it
as
a
whole,
the
maryland
petition
nominating
system
is
substantially
more
liberal
than
that
of
many
states
and
does
not
place
insurmountable
restrictions
in
the
way
of
an
independent
candidate.
i
summarized
the
feature
of
our
law
at
the
beginning
of
our
argument.
it
is
summarized
at
pages
23-24
of
our
brief,
and
i
think
does
not
merit
further
comment,
again
reemphasize
that
there
is
no
limitation
on
the
gathering
period
and
there
are
no
significant
disqualification
in
terms
of
who
may
sing
the
petitions.
we
also
submit
that
when
viewed
in
relative
terms,
the
record
below
indicates
that
there
is
no
substantial
imbalance
as
between
the
route
available
in
maryland
to
independent
candidates
and
the
route
available
to
party
primary
candidates.
when
we
turn
to
actual
experience
in
maryland
as
we
are
told
by
this
court’s
decision
we
should,
we
find
that
independent
candidates
have
qualified
for
a
place
on
the
ballot
with
sufficient
regularity
to
indicate
that
the
obstacles
are
not
insurmountable.
in
1974
the
record
demonstrates
that
eight
candidates
qualified
for
state
legislative
contest
and
in
1976
two
candidates
qualified
for
congressional
contest
by
the
march
8th
deadline,
and
mr.
bradley
himself
would
have
qualified
but
for
the
invalidation.
even
if
this
court
should
determine
that
the
obstacles
imposed
are
substantial
either
in
absolute
or
relative
terms
and
that
the
actual
experience
is
not
sufficient
to
indicate
the
feasibility
of
a
reasonably
diligent
candidate’s
qualifying,
the
statute
must
be
upheld
if
it
is
based
upon
compelling
state
interest
which
can
not
be
served
equally
well
in
significantly
less
burdensome
ways.
there
are
significant
and
compelling
state
interests
at
stake
here
and
they
go
beyond
as
i
have
indicated
above
those
discussed
in
salera.
the
prevention
of
frivolous
and
fraudulent
independent
candidacies,
maturing
only
after
the
conclusion
of
the
primary
elections,
has
been
recognized
as
a
substantial
interest,
and
i
would
submit
it
is
furthered
and
enhanced
by
the
filing
deadline
established
under
maryland
law.
related
interest
is
the
elimination
of
voter
confusion
caused
by
late-blooming
candidacies,
a
consideration
which
maybe
especially
important
in
the
presidential
year
when
political
activity
is
both,
more
intense
and
more
long-lasting.
the
need
to
insure
that
both
party
primary
candidates
and
independent
candidates
including
those
who
obtained
general
election
ballot
access
after
all
of
the
validation
and
primary
election
procedures
are
over,
to
insure
that
they
are
afforded
relatively
comparable
treatment
and
that
neither
has
given
an
unfair
advantage.
by
establishing
the
same
filing
deadline
and
providing
for
a
system
at
about
the
time
of
the
primary
election,
the
voters
and
all
candidates
will
know
who
is
going
to
be
on
the
general
election
ballot.
a
system
not
requiring
the
filings
to
take
place
into
on
or
after
the
primary
election
would
leave
up
in
the
air,
the
status
of
independent
candidates
in
terms
of
their
position
on
the
general
election
ballot.
the
fostering
of
public
discussion
of
campaign
issues
among
all
candidates,
when
voter
interest
is
at
its
peak
during
the
primary
election
rather
than
allowing
independent
candidacies
to
remain
embryonic
or
dormant
until
the
primaries
have
ended.
the
prevention
or
alleviation
of
the
administrative
problems
that
might
surface
at
the
petition
verification
process
and
likely
challenges,
such
as
this
one,
where
telescoped
into
a
shorter
and
later
period
time.
and
finally,
the
promotion
of
all
of
these
interests
while
still
preserving
the
right
of
maryland
voters
to
express
themselves
early
in
a
presidential
election
year
as
to
there
choice
for
presidential
nominees.
the
testimony
of
professor
smucker
(ph)
which
is
summarized
at
page
8-9
and
28-29
of
our
brief,
indicate,
i
believe,
and
illustrate
the
fairness
of
the
system
and
highlight
the
fact
that
independent
candidates
are
not
treated
unfairly
relative
to
primary
candidates
with
respect
to
the
earliness
of
the
deadline
and
the
contention
that
it
hampers
the
independent
candidate.
i
think
it
is
well
know
of
course
to
take
the
presidential
primary
elections
as
an
example
that
the
presidential
primary
has
held
in
new
hampshire
in
february
of
the
election
year.
if
the
decision
below
stands
and
if
this
kind
of
analysis
stands,
it
is
entirely
conceivable
that
the
next
time
around
in
a
presidential
election
year
someone
will
be
arguing
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
provide
such
an
early
primary
in
new
hampshire,
which
in
fact
even
forces
the
candidates
to
be
actively
campaigning
in
the
year
prior
to
the
election.
i
think
right
now
mr.
bradley
has
contented
in
his
brief
in
an
argument
below
that
it
is
unfair
to
make
him
sort
before
the
period
immediately
preceding
the
primary
on
the
theory,
on
the
grounds
that
the
primary
election
candidates
are
not
required
to
start
so
early
but
only
have
to
begin
during
those
last
70
days
before
the
primary.
that
is
not
the
way
politics
run,
that
is
not
the
way
elections
are
run.
in
the
state
of
maryland
now
we
have
almost
one
article
a
day
on
the
gubernatorial
candidates
for
the
1978
election
and
we
are
at
1977
and
early
1977,
campaigns
must
start
early.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
well,
going
through
the
standards,
i
believe,
they
fairly
clearly
emerged
from
the
court’s
opinions,
and
i
believe
that
they
were
not
properly
applied
by
the
lower
court.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
only,
if
you
only
reach
the
compelling
interest
question
and
you
only
look
at
this
court’s
opinions
identifying
what
are
compelling
interests.
if
you
find
that
the
relative
access
routes
for
the
independents
and
the
primary
candidates
are
so
desperate
as
to
give
a
severe
advantage
to
the
primary
candidate
or
that
they
impose
such
a
heavy
burden.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
correct,
or
for
the
excessively
heavy
nature
of
the
burden
placed
on
independents,
and
only
if
you
find
those
you
get
to
the
compelling
interest.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
it
establishes
a
filing
deadline
--
there
are
number
of
interest
which
i
have
outlined,
but
basically
it
establishes
a
filing
deadline
which
is
the
same
for
primary
candidates
and
independent
candidates.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
it
brings
all
of
the
candidates
out
at
the
same
time,
so
that
everybody
knows
who
its
potential
opposition
is.
it
turns
--
mr.
george
a.
nilson
well,
they
are
not
just
running
in
the
primary.
nobody
can
run
a
primary
election
without
having
an
eye
to
the
general
election.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
true,
but
--
mr.
george
a.
nilson
well,
he
is
in
the
different
kind
of
campaign
with
the
same
objective,
but
what
the
law
requires
is
that
he
do
what
he
is
required
to
do
to
establish
the
substantiality
of
his
support
by
the
same
filing
deadline
as
everyone
else,
and
that
enables
the
state
election
officials
to
use
the
next
35
days
to
validate
those
petitions
and
determine
whether
he
will
truly
be
on
the
ballot.
so
that
you
then
come
down
to
the
period
in
time
immediately
prior
to
the
primary
election
when
it
is
basically
known
that
you
have
a
set
of
primary
candidates
for
one
party
another
set
of
primary
candidates
for
another.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
as
long
as
the
process
stays
within
the
election.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
pardon
me.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
till
the
general
election,
that
is
true.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
in
terms
of
the
administrative
problem
of
validation,
that
is
correct,
certainly
as
long
as
the
validation
stops.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
if
it
were
the
primary
election
date
you
would
lose
--
the
candidates
in
the
primary
elections
would
not
know
who
there
potential
opposition
was
going
to
be
in
the
general
election,
i
would
say
potential
opposition.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
the
ones
who
are
ultimately
chosen.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
correct,
but
you
take
the
voters
of
a
major
parties
who
were
trying
to
consider
who
they
want
their
party
to
nominate.
one
very
important
factor
in
their
making
that
decision
at
the
primary
election
is
who
is
the
opposition
going
to
be?
what
kind
of
chance
in
the
general
election
is
our
party’s
candidate
going
to
have?
if
there
is
a
strong
independent
who
is
going
to
be
on
that
general
election
ballot,
the
presence
of
that
kind
of
it
can
be
a
very
important
factor
to
voters
who
are
voting
in
a
primary
election,
because
a
primary
voter,
let
us
say,
the
democratic
or
the
republican
party
may
say,
what
we
know
that
candidate
access
is
going
to
be
on
that
ballot
as
an
independent,
he
has
a
very
strong
appeal
of
this
type
that
needs
the
--
mr.
george
a.
nilson
but
you
see
the
people
who
are
asked
to
sign
a
petition
for
an
independent
are
not
having
to
make
choices
among
people.
they
are
presented
with
the
petition
--
mr.
george
a.
nilson
they
can
sign
one
petition,
they
can
sign
seven
petitions.
they
are
not
being
asked
to
make
a
choice
among
a
group;
they
are
simply
being
asked
by
a
particular
candidate,
will
you
support
me
for
a
place
on
the
ballot.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
the
press
simply
involves
candidates.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
principle
discussion
now
is
about
the
major
party
candidate,
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
no,
the
time
that
they
get
to
talking
about
independent
candidates
is
when
they
begin
conducting
a
serious
campaign.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
no.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
media
certainly
does,
they
cover
the
campaigning
activity.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
well,
the
record
indicates
that
mr.
bradley
was
having
difficulty
getting
media
coverage
prior
to
the
campaign
season,
but
that
is
not
because
necessarily
--
mr.
george
a.
nilson
i
do
not
believe
that
is
contradicted.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
it
is
a
handicap
to
him
but
i
do
not
--
he
is
not
constitutionally
--
mr.
george
a.
nilson
i
do
not
see
anything
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
entitles
him
to
the
kind
of
fall
out
attention
that
he
would
get
from
the
press
as
a
result
of
their
paying
attention
to
primary
campaigns.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
well
i
do
not
believe
that
is
the
only
reason
i
have
given.
i
have
also
mentioned
to
the
court
the
prevention
of
the
late-blooming
or
frivolous
candidacies.
we
have
had
situations
in
maryland,
for
example,
where
a
same
name
candidate
has
developed,
where
other
candidates
have
emerged
when
they
have
been
allowed
to
emerged
late
in
process,
those
have
a
particular
political
appeal
so
striking
off
those.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
the
early
deadline
prevents
that
from
happening
and
that
is
a
legitimate
interest
of
the
state.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
well,
the
court
ended
up
giving
mr.
bradley
until
july,
and
he
did,
with
that
extra
time,
secure
sufficient
signatures.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
there
is
pending
before
the
general
assembly
a
bill
now
which
would
all
through
the
present
scheme.
it
is
pending
and
it
has
not
been
acted
upon.
that
bill
would
require
a
portion
of
the
3%
signatures
to
be
filed
on
the
present
filing
date
with
the
remainder,
i
think
it
is
1%
at
the
first
time,
2%
at
the
second
time,
the
remainder
to
be
filed
on
the
primary
date
in
presidential
election
years
and
30
days
after
the
original
filing
in
other
election
years.
but
i
would
strongly
urge
this
court
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
court’s
written
opinions
that
establish
that
such
a
change
is
constitutionally
necessary.
we
had
candidates
get
on
the
ballot
with
some
regularity
in
the
last
two
elections
under
the
present
scheme.
that
demonstrates
that
it
is
reasonable
and
possible
and
feasible
ballot
access
method.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
we
have
not
had
candidates
others
than
mr.
bradley
make
a
serious
effort
of
statewide
office
as
an
independent
that
i
know
of
in
the
two,
in
the
elections
that
i
am
dealing
with.
pardon
me.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
well,
i
think
the
local
candidate
figures
out
that
is
the
same
3%
requirement,
and
i
think
this
court
made
it
very
clear
in
storer,
for
example,
the
higher
up
the
office
is,
it
is
a
harder
job
and
you
got
to
spend
more
effort.
i
think
in
the
storer
the
court
indicated
--
mr.
george
a.
nilson
no,
no
of
his
area,
but
he
is
running
a
lower
level
campaign.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
correct,
but
he
is
running
different
level
of
campaign.
this
court
indicated
in
storer
that
for
a
presidential
candidate
in
california
that
it
was
not
unreasonable
to
require
him
to
gather
14,000
signatures
a
day,
and
the
court
essentially
said,
when
you
are
running
for
a
big
office
in
a
big
area
you
got
to
have
the
campaign
organization
that
is
going
to
be
necessary
and
that
is
going
to
allow
you
to
undertake
that
kind
of
effort.
he
was
running
for
a
statewide
office
or
for
a
statewide
nomination
or
ballot
position,
mr.
bradley
was
running
for
an
important
position
here.
i
think
he
is
required
to
undertake
a
significant
effort
to
comply
with
the
law.
now,
i
do
not
think
the
law
imposes
unreasonable
requirement
on
him.
thank
you
very
much.
