hicks
against
miranda
dealt
with
the
significance
of
prior
dismissals
for
one
of
the
substantial
federal
question,
didn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
or
at
least
as
much
weight.
unknown
speaker
there
is
nothing
new
about
it.
unknown
speaker
it
was
not
with
respect
to
summary
affirmance,
wasn’t
it?
when
hicks
against
miranda,
the
new
ground
it
broke,
if
it
was
new
ground,
had
to
do
with
dismissals
for
one
of
his
substantial
federal
question,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
nilson
let
me
interrupt
you,
has
mr.
bradley
made
any
noises
about
running
again?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
what
there
is
moot?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
the
case
is
moot?
unknown
speaker
why
it
is
noted
that
(inaudible),
do
you
think
it
is
just
likely
to
--
it
is
difficult
to
--
unknown
speaker
they
all
bizarre.
unknown
speaker
i
said
they
all
bizarre
without
a
doubt.
unknown
speaker
whatever
you
do,
whatever
we
do
with
this
case,
simply
is
--
unknown
speaker
there
would
be
many
of
them
in
the
next
election
year.
unknown
speaker
in
general
auerbach
was
written
also
by
judge
winter
(ph),
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
so,
he
was
familiar
with
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
nilson,
do
i
understand
you
to
agree
that
as
to
what
standard
is
applicable
to
this
case?
unknown
speaker
not
properly
applied.
do
you
think
it
is
a
compelling
interest?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
you
do
not
reach
that
problem
unless
you
find
the
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
well
assume
we
did,
and
then
the
question
might
become
whether
you
could
serve
your
ends
by
some
other
less
burdensome
way,
what
is
the
state’s
reason
for
having
the
particular
early
filing
date?
unknown
speaker
well
what
is
so
good
about
that?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
party
people
are
just
running
in
the
primary.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
that,
but
you
do
not
know
who
is
--
but
until,
as
the
primary
held,
you
do
not
know
who
is
going
to
be
on
the
ballot?
unknown
speaker
and
so
the
fellow,
who
asked
to
circulate
his
petitions
before
the
primary
is
really
in
a
different
kind
of
a
campaign,
isn’t
he?
unknown
speaker
do
they
only
need
35
days
to
determine
whether
these
signatures
are
alike?
unknown
speaker
and
that
35
--
that
is
a
lot
longer
than
35
days
till
election?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
lot
longer
than
35
days
until
election?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
terms
of
being
able
to
check
the
filing
date
to
be
much
like
--
unknown
speaker
but
what
would
the
state
lose,
what
interest
the
state
would
be
substantially
hampered,
if
the
filing
date
were
the
primary
election
date?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
were
the
ones
who
were
chosen
at
the
primary
election
would
--
unknown
speaker
because
then
if
the
independent
candidates
file
on
the
date
on
the
primary
election
and
if
their
signatures
are
good
they
will
then
be
on
the
ballot.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
nilson
not
you
are
saying
that
the
members
of
the
major
parties
are
entitled
to
this
information,
but
those
who
are
considering
whether
to
sign
a
petition
for
an
independent
are
not
entitled
to
this
information?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
it
is
sort
of
a
commitment
in
a
sense.
unknown
speaker
he
is
a
sure
winner.
unknown
speaker
he
is
a
sure
winner,
he
is
not
on
a
primary
contest
then,
it
is
not
on
a
primary
election,
he
is
on
the
ballot.
unknown
speaker
my
current
point
to
the,
if
somebody
goes
into
a
primary
election
he
is
competing
for
both
against
one
or
more
other
people
in
the
party
primary
he
might
get
40%
of
the
votes
and
still
lose
--
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
fortson
against
jenness,
if
it
stood
for
anything,
it
stood
for
the
proposition
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
a
state
to
treat
independent
candidates
and
those
who
enter
a
primary
election,
the
same.
that
is
what
it
said
that
some
times
nothing
can
be
more
unfair
than
treating
things
that
are
not
the
same
as
though
they
were
the
same.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
suggesting
that
the
state
has
an
obligation
to
do
it
the
best
way,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
what
part
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments?
unknown
speaker
what
part
of
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendments?
each
of
those
amendments
contains
a
good
many
subjects?
unknown
speaker
these
are
may
be
those
who
are
under
the
party
primaries?
unknown
speaker
and
the
association
or
the
first
amendment’s
associational
right
is
the
right
of
his
supporters
to
effectively
associate
in
order
to
try
to
elect
him,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
whether
the
court
did
or
did
not
give
too
much
weight
to
the
summary
affirmance
in
the
pennsylvania
case,
there
is
a
brittle
moment
now
that
this
case
is
here,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
it
is
here
to
be
decided
on
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
any
event,
the
three-judge
court
in
this
case
held
that
the
summary
affirmance
in
the
salera
case
was
a
controlling
authority
and
whether
it
was
right
or
wrong,
as
now
to
be
decided
here,
as
an
independent
matter.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
is
a
test?
