mr.
jon
t.
brown
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
jon
t.
brown;
i
am
representing
the
appellee,
bruce
bradley
in
these
proceedings.
just
as
a
brief
preliminary
matter,
with
respect
to
the
jurisdictional
statement
to
which
mr.
nilson
referred
during
the
case
of
auerbach
versus
mandel,
and
that
reference
to
what
was
in
the
jurisdictional
statement,
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
for
the
record
to
point
out
that
it
was
not
indeed
the
state’s
position
that
a
constitutional
issue
was
raised
in
auerbach
versus
mandel.
quite
to
the
contrary,
it
was
the
state’s
position
in
their
motion
to
affirm
that
no
constitutional
issue
was
raised
in
auerbach
versus
mandel.
they
indicated
quite
specifically
in
their
motion
to
affirm
that
the
entire
matter
was
decided
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
and
that
of
course
is
precisely
what
judge
winter
determined
initially
in
auerbach
versus
mandel
and
determined
once
again
in
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
district
court
in
these
proceedings.
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
the
substantiality
of
the
burden
and
the
parity
among
the
various
candidates,
both
independent
and
primary
party
candidates
or
principle
party
candidates,
i
believe
that
there
is
another
matter
which
has
probated
these
proceeding
and
that
is
the
question
of
parity.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
indeed
independent
candidates
are
treated
the
same
in
the
state
of
maryland
as
are
partisan
party
candidates.
it
was
a
matter
which
was
raised
before
the
three-judge
district
court
and
it
is
a
matter
which
has
been
raised
here
today.
i
think
the
conclusion
is
inescapable
that
there
is
no
parity,
there
is
no
fairness
between
the
way
the
parties,
the
various
candidates
are
treated.
in
effect
the
independent
candidates’
primary
election
ends
70
days
prior
to
the
partisan
party
candidates.
mr.
jon
t.
brown
i
beg
a
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
jon
t.
brown
he
is
on
the
ballot
providing
that
he
has
had,
he
has
been
able
to
obtain
the
3%
which
at
1976
was
51,000
voters,
that
is
correct.
mr.
jon
t.
brown
that
is
correct
your
honor,
and
he
is
competing,
i
might
suggest,
in
a
climate
in
which
the
political
aspects
of
the
campaign
are
very
much
heightened,
the
media
attention
is
heightened,
and
he
is
competing
in
an
arena
which
he
has
chosen
to
compete
in.
mr.
jon
t.
brown
i
think
that
is
correct
your
honor.
however,
in
this
instance
there
is
a
question
that
goes
far
beyond
the
question
parity
among
the
candidates
but
rather
in
addition
to
the
question
of
the
substantially
of
the
burden
upon
the
independent
candidate,
and
which
goes
precisely
to
that
synergistic
effect
between
amount
of
signatures
which
are
required
to
be
obtained
by
the
independent
candidate
and
remoteness
from
both
the
primary
filing
deadline
and
the
general
election
deadline
which
an
independent
candidate
must
reach
contrary
to
situation
in
jenness.
mr.
jon
t.
brown
the
situation
in
the
state
of
maryland
provides
that
as
it
was
indicated
in
the
record
below
a
primary
filing
deadline
which
--
pardon
me
--
an
independent
candidate
filing
deadline
which
is
march
8th,
provides
very,
very
substantial
burdens
for
a
party
seeking
access
to
the
ballot
via
the
independent
process
route.
the
record
was
replete
with
uncontradicted
testimony
that
the
independent
candidate
faced
insurmountable
difficulties
at
that
stage
of
the
process
in
getting
his
name
upon
the
ballot.
under
such
a
circumstance
this
court
has
held
on
numerous
occasions,
buckley
versus
valeo,
in
storer
versus
brown
that
the
exacting
scrutiny
test
is
that
test
which
must
be
applied,
and
under
those
circumstances
the
exacting
scrutiny
test
being
applied.
if
that
is
applied
in
these
instances
then
the
question
of
compelling
state
interest
becomes
immediately
before
the
court.
compelling
state
interest
here
have
been
found
by
the
court
below
to
be
insubstantial
of
those
which
have
been
raised
subsequent
to
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
we
have
treated
with
on
brief,
and
while
they
indeed
are
raised
by
the
state
as
compelling
state
interest,
there
does
not
appear
to
be
anything
in
those
which
have
been
raised
which
are
compelling
in
true
sense
of
the
word
that
they
could
not
be
dealt
with
in
less
restrictive
means
which
this
court
has
mandated
in
dunn
versus
blumstein
and
similar
cases.
for
example,
as
this
court
recognized,
the
plan
which
we
have
submitted
or
which
we
have
suggested
to
the
court
and
which
was,
in
effect,
adopted
by
the
court
below,
deals,
we
believe,
with
all
of
the
issues
which
the
state
has
raised
in
raising
the
issue
of
compelling
state
interests,
and
also
provides
a
parity
of
access
for
independent
candidates
and
removes
the
substantiality
of
the
burdens
which
independent
candidates
face
particularly
in
presidential
election
years.
it
was
adopted
essentially
by
simply
providing
that
on
the
filing
date,
that
mutual
filing
date
which
all
the
candidates
have
which
in
this
instance
was
march
8th,
that
all
of
the
candidates
file
their
petitions,
and
our
suggestion
was
and
as
adopted
by
the
court
that
with
a
nominal
but
not
insubstantial
number
of
petitions,
petition
signatures,
and
that
between
the
time
of
the
filing
date
and
the
primary
date
that
all
of
the
party
candidates
and
all
the
independent
candidates
engage
in
the
same
kind
of
open
discussion
of
the
issues
which
this
state
has
suggested
are
necessary
in
order
to
provide
each
with
access
to
the
ballot
in
a
comparable
fashion.
so
that
during
that
period
when
the
immediate
interest
is
heightened
when
weather
conditions
are
far
substantially
improved
in
most
instances,
when
the
issues
of
the
campaign
are
begging
to
crystallize,
and
when
voter
interest
is
reaching
its
peak
that
each
of
the
candidates
both
partisan
candidates
and
independent
candidates
will
have
an
opportunity
of
excess
to
the
ballot.
we
believe
this
is
a
way
or
perhaps
the
best
way
in
this
instance
in
which
the
court
can
create,
can
alleviate
the
substantial
barriers
which
exist
in
the
state
of
maryland
because
of
the
remoteness
of
the
filing
deadline,
and
still
maintain
and
protect
whatever
compelling
state
interests
truly
exist
in
these
situations.
mr.
jon
t.
brown
no
your
honor,
i
am
not.
i
am
suggesting
that
in
this
instance
the
burden
is
placed
upon
independent
candidate
because
of
the
remoteness
of
the
deadline
as
found
in
salera
and
as
summarily
affirmed
by
this
court
or
found
to
be
so
substantial
that
they
were
found
to
be
contrary
to
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
i
would
not
suggest
that
--
mr.
jon
t.
brown
i
beg
a
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
jon
t.
brown
yes,
first
amendment,
your
honor,
with
respect
primarily
to
the
issue
of
freedom
of
association,
the
question
of
and
the
right
to
vote
as
that
is
maintained
and
encompassed
within
the
freedom
of
association
which
is
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment.
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
of
equal
protection
which
to
some
extent
focuses
more
directly
upon
the
candidate
rather
than
upon
his
supporters
but
the
right
of
equal
protection
the
law
that
he
not
be
discriminated
against
as
far
as
access
to
the
ballot
is
considered.
mr.
jon
t.
brown
vis-a-vis
those
who
are
under
the
party
primaries,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jon
t.
brown
yes
your
honor,
effectively
associate
at
a
time
which
is
meaningful
at
a
time
which
they
can
become
aware
of
the
fact
that
he
is
a
candidate
that
they
can
become
aware
and
participate
in
the
process
of
getting
additional
supporters
to
support
that
candidate.
at
a
time
which
does
not
discriminate
against
their
ability
to
permit
him
access
to
the
ballot
just
as
a
primary
candidate
is
not
discriminated
against
by
during
the
time
that
the
heavy
media
coverage
is
occurring
during
a
primary
campaign.
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
hicks
versus
miranda
we
would
strongly
disagree
with
the
state
that
the
court
below
misapplied
hicks
versus
miranda,
indeed
quite
the
contrary,
we
think
that
the
court
below
has
applied
hicks,
miranda
in
precisely
the
way
which
this
court
has
mandated
in
the
decision
and
in
tully.
mr.
jon
t.
brown
that
is
correct
your
honor
but
--
mr.
jon
t.
brown
yes
it
is
your
honor,
that
is
correct,
and
we
would
certainly
concede
that
it
is
here
to
be
decided
on
the
merits.
however,
with
respect
--
if
the
court
has
concerns
with
the
respect
to,
to
look
hicks
at
this
point.
we
would
suggest
that
the
court
below
property
applied
hicks,
and
indeed
that
as
an
adjunct
to
that
proposition
the
court
below
made
the
extensive
findings
of
fact
which
were
necessary
in
order
to
determine
that
the
burdensome
nature
of
an
independent
candidate’s
race
or
process
to
the
ballot
in
maryland,
and
also
made
without
--
it
indicated
without
extensive
findings
of
the
fact,
it
made
the
finding
independent
of
hicks,
independent
of
salera
that
those
substantial
burdens
were
sufficient
in
and
out
themselves
to
be
violated
with
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendments.
mr.
jon
t.
brown
it
is
an
independent
matter
your
honor,
yes
that
is
correct.
however,
there
are
conflicting
statements
in
the
statement
of
the
court
below.
at
one
point
it
indicates
that
legally
they
felt
down
by
salera,
at
another
point
it
indicates
that
they
had
made
an
independent
finding
independent
of
salera,
but
regardless
of
hicks,
as
your
honor
has
pointed
out,
the
case
is
here
to
be
decided
upon
the
merits,
and
as
a
part
of
consequence
and
as
a
part
of
those
factual
matters
which
must
be
taken
in
the
consideration
are
the
findings
that
we
believe
that
the
court
below
with
respect
to
the
uncontradicted
testimony
of
the
individuals
who
participated
in
the
process
of
attempting
to
get
mr.
bradley
on
the
ballot.
as
mr.
nilson
has
indicated
those
findings
were
uncontradicted
that
with
respect
to
the
burdens
which
were
faced
by
the
campaign
organization
at
that
time
of
remoteness
from
the
general
election
deadline
and
primary
deadline.
standing
by
themselves,
they
have,
the
court
below
has
indicated
that
provide
the
substantially
of
burden
which
then
makes
it
incumbent
upon
the
state
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
has
a
compelling
state
interest
and
of
course
incumbent
upon
this
court
to
determine
whether
that
compelling
state
interest
is
sufficient.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
as
one
of
the
compelling
state
interests
which
were
raised
by
the
state
was
the
matter
of
validation
and
the
matter
that
all
primary
candidates
or
all
candidates
should
be
known
at
the
same
time.
the
state
statute,
the
state
of
maryland
has
a
statute
which
requires
that
that
be
determined
within
35
days.
however,
the
experience
is
quite
the
contrary
in
particular
instances
that
in
some
instances
for
example
in
baltimore
city
that
determination
of
the
validation
of
signatures
can
be
made
as
rapidly
as
five
days,
and
was
in
fact
made
as
rapidly
as
five
days.
certainly,
when
it
comes
to
the
constitutional
rights
of
an
individual
and
of
his
supporters
for
association,
whatever
burden
the
state
may
face
with
respect
to
its
administrative
burdens
for
validating
signatures,
is
no
greater
than
whatever
administrative
burdens
it
may
face
for
counting
election
ballots,
certainly
election
ballots
in
a
contested
election.
in
summary,
we
would
suggest
that
the
court
below
was
absolutely
correct
in
its
finding
of
the
substantiality
of
the
burden
to
the
ballot
faced
by
the
independent
candidate
in
maryland,
that
the
history
of
that
balloting,
of
that
polling
in
the
state
of
the
maryland
has
determined
precisely
that
it
is
very
difficult
indeed
for
a
statewide
candidate
to
achieve
access
to
the
ballot,
and
that
in
order
for
--
if
there
are
compelling
state
interests
in
order
for
those
compelling
state
interests
to
be
given
whatever
recognition
they
must
be
given
in
the
least
possible
restrictive
way.
the
plan
which
was
suggested
by
mr.
bradley
to
the
court
below
and
which
was
adapted
by
the
court
below
is
precisely
that
plan
which
best
effects
the
compelling
state
interests.
the
test
of
experience
is
perhaps
is
as
important
as
any.
mr.
bradley
was
afforded
access
to
the
ballot.
he
was
defeated
in
the
general
elections,
but
nevertheless
none
of
the
nine
proffered
state
compelling
interests
were
in
any
way
threatened
or
impinged
upon
by
the
process
which
was
devised
by
the
court
below
and
the
process
by
which
mr.
bradley
was
afforded
access
to
the
ballot
and
participated
in
the
general
election
process.
mr.
jon
t.
brown
i
would
not
your
honor
suggest
the
test
of
experience
but
we
have,
in
this
case,
the
unique
opportunity
of
hindsight
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
compelling
state
interest
which
are
proffered
by
the
state
are
indeed
compelling
state
interests
or
whether
or
not
they
are
interests
which
can
be
accommodated
by
less
restrictive
means.
