justice

you
have
mentioned
that
there
is
lot
of
press
concerning
who
is
going
to
run
for
governor
next
year,
does
there
any
of
the
press
involve
independent
candidate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
independent
candidate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
only
time
you
get
to
talking
about
the
independent
candidate
is
after
the
primary,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
is
after
the
primary?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
does
the
media
do
anything
before
the
primary?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
the
record
said
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
contradicted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn’t
that
a
handicap
to
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
don’t
you
think
that
is
as
important
as
the
ordinary
voter
in
a
primary
knowing
something?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
said
to
question
your
rights
of
the
state,
the
reason
of
state
did
this,
and
the
only
reason
you
gave
is
that
the
primary
voters
of
the
major
parties
will
know
who
the
independent
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
without
reason
mr.
bradley
can
you
go
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
yet
it
showed
that
with
the
little
time
that
court
gave
mr.
bradley,
did
get
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
has
not
the
state
made
any
move
to
change
it
to
comply
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
statewide
office?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
it
is
on
the
amendment
of
congress
and
local
candidates
do
not
have
too
much.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
through
the
whole
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
(inaudible).
