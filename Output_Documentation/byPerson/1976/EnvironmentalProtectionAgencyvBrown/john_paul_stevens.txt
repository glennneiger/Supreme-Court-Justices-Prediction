justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
epa’s
argument
here
limited
to
the
contention
that,
in
effect,
conceding
that
the
administrator
himself
has
to
fill
in
all
the
details
of
a
federal
plan
after
a
state
plan
is
rejected
in
whole
or
in
part
and
so
you're
simply
dealing
with
the
state
in
its
essentially
proprietary
capacity?
the
thing
i
thought
was
still
an
issue
was
that
the
administrator
said
in
filling
in
those
details
he
could
say,
state,
you
hire
10,000
people
to
carry
out
the
details
of
this
plan.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
isn't
a
detail.
it's
one
thing
for
the
epa
to
say
we're
going
to
see
that
no
vehicle
in
the
state
of
california
violates
federal
standards,
which
everybody
in
this
case
i
understand
concedes
the
congress
has
a
perfect
right
to
authorize
and
the
administrator
has
a
right
to
promulgate.
it's
another
thing
to
say
we're
going
to
see
to
it
and
we're
going
to
conscript
10,000
state
employees
to
enforce
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
how
about
the
statute?
does
the
statute
authorize
it?
we're
still
at
that
level.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
it
isn't
a
question
of
if
there's
anything
in
the
statute
to
prevent
it;
does
anything
authorize
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
randolph,
you
would
draw
a
distinction,
then,
between
a
state
which
owns
its
own
highways
and
one
which
decided
to
finance
all
its
highways
by
vesting
them
in
some
turnpike
commission
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then,
they
would
not
be
a
polluter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
would
still
have
the
same
normal
authority
over
traffic
control,
regardless
of
their
ownership.
is
the
ownership
of
the
highway
really
the
significant
factor
when
you
look
at
the
operation
of
a
state
running
its
highways
or
is
it
the
fact
that
police
forces
have
an
interest
in
people
not
getting
killed
on
the
highways
and
things
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
specific
statutory
support
for
this
argument?
i
really
have
trouble
finding
the
text
that
lends
any
support
at
all
to
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
just
go
slowly
enough
so
we
find
where
it
is
now?
justice
john
paul
stevens
5-a
of
the
appendix
to
your
brief,
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
sir,
i'm
awfully
slow;
but
110(g)
is
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
7a(g).
it
provides
to
the
extent
necessary,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
again,
let
me
slow
you
down,
mr.
randolph,
because
i
do
want
to
understand
your
arguments.
this
section,
as
i
understand
it,
deals
with
the
duty
of
a
state
as
a
regulator,
not
with
the
duty
of
a
state
as
an
owner
of
highways.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
where
does
it
deal
with
the
state
in
its
capacity
as
a
potential
polluter
or
an
owner
of
a
highway?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
my
point,
mr.
randolph,
is
this
section
is
talking
about
what
it
must
do
because
it's
a
governmental
agency,
not
what
it
must
do
because
it's
an
owner
of
property
which
may
pollute
the
atmosphere.
what
talks
about
its
duty
as
an
owner
of
property
that
may
pollute
the
atmosphere?
that's
what
your
whole
theory
is,
as
i
understand
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
regulate
itself,
as
a
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that;
but
what
is
it
that's
in
this
section
that
teaches
anything
about
the
owner
of
a
highway
being
a
polluter?
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
and
i
are
concerned
about
the
absence
of
anything
in
the
statute
to
suggest
that
that
kind
of
activity
makes
the
state
a
polluter
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
state
as
an
incinerator
owner,
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
can
understand
the
state
as
a
regulator
would
control
the
transportation
that
takes
place
on
its
highways;
that's
easy.
but
does
that
mean
that
in
its
capacity
as
an
owner
of
the
highway,
it
has
a
different
duty
than
as
a
regulator?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
far
is
your
argument
going
along
these
lines?
is
it
your
claim
that
there's
no
power
to
regulate
any
indirect
source
of
air
pollution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
now,
what
then
leads
you
to
concede
that
there's
any
power
to
regulate
any
indirect
source
if
there's
no
statutory
authority?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
think
it
is
of
some
importance
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
there
is,
then
one
takes
a
step
from
that
or
doesn't
take
a
step
from
that.
but
if
there
isn’t
any
power
whatever
to
regulate
any
indirect
source,
you
don't
take
the
first
step.
that's
quite
important
in
this
instance
where
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
do
have
to
reach
it,
because
as
i
say
if
there
is
a
power
on
the
part
of
the
administrator
or
a
state
plan
to
reach
an
indirect
source,
then
we're
faced
with
one
kind
of
a
case;
if
there's
no
power
at
all
to
reach
any
indirect
source,
then
you
have
a
much
easier
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
shouldn’t
your
argument
be
perhaps
that
assuming
that
there's
power
in
congress
--
not
in
epa,
in
congress
--
to
regulate
indirect
sources.
the
congress
has
not
undertaken
to
exercise
it
in
this
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you
say
that
congress
in
this
statute
has
not
authorized
the
administrator
to
regulate
any
indirect
source
of
air
pollution.
is
that
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mascowitz,
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
all
these
letters
and
numbers
go
together;
but
section
110(a)
to
(d),
which
appears
on
135(a)
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
district
of
columbia
case,
talks
about
the
contents
of
plans,
and
it
certainly
authorizes
regulation
of
sources.
and
couldn’t
the
administrator
take
the
position
that
i'm
choosing
to
define
"sources"
broadly
and
that
indirect
sources
would
be
included,
as
well
as
direct
sources?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he's
attracted
to
the
superhighway,
too,
to
get
to
work.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let's
assume
that
the
indianapolis
speedway
is
owned
by
the
city
of
indianapolis.
does
the
administrator
have
the
power
to
regulate
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
about
a
sewer?
that
is
a
conduit
for
effluent
from
one
place
to
another.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
because
that's
why
i
brought
it
up;
it's
not
air
pollution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mascowitz,
on
that
very
point,
supposing
you
had
a
large
factory
with
a
large
parking
lot
that
would
come
within
the
indirect-source
definition
you've
described.
would
it
be
your
view
that
the
administrator
would
have
the
statutory
authority
to
regulate
that
indirect
source
by
saying
you
must
adopt
a
company
policy
of
certain
timing
of
shifts
or
certain
regulations
in
the
parking
lot
or
you
can't
let
anybody
use
the
parking
lot
unless
they
have
a
car
with
the
proper
emissions,
that
kind
of
regulation
of
a
private
owner.
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
you
answer
my
question?
did
you
understand
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
administrator
have
the
statutory
authority
to
promulgate
a
regulation
affecting
an
indirect
source
such
as
the
one
described
which
would
require
it
to
adopt
certain
affirmative
rules
applying
to
its
own
employees,
how
they
use
the
parking
lots
and
the
like,
for
the
purpose
of
reducing
concentrations
of
air
emissions
in
that
parking
lot?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
stop
you
right
there.
if
you
make
the
assumption
and
i
realize
you're
very
reluctant
to
agree
to
anything,
i
guess,
other
than
that
you
don't
like
this
particular
program
but
if
you
make
the
assumption
that
a
privately
owned
factory
and
associated
parking
lot
is
an
indirect
source
subject
to
regulation.
would
you
not
further
agree
that
on
those
facts,
the
owner
of
those
facilities
could
be
compelled
affirmatively
to
adopt
certain
controls
of
the
use
of
those
properties,
such
as
times
people
can
enter
and
leave,
how
many
cars
can
be
parked
at
any
given
time,
whether
they
can
be
of
a
particular
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
can’t
the
government
make
the
state
--
i
mean,
under
the
statute,
what's
the
difference,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
why
do
you
concede
that
he
has
power
to
do
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
once
you
do,
your
case
is
much
weaker
than
it
otherwise
would
be,
your
statutory
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
hire
ten
more
people.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
operate
your
incinerator,
including
all
sorts
of
inspectors
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
up
to
you
to
find
out
how
to
do
it,
just
the
same
as
any
private
polluter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
simply
have
more
power
than
a
private
polluter
to
do
it
and
to
do
it
more
easily.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assuming
that
their
regulation
said
this
is
the
result
we
want
to
achieve:
we
want
vehicles
inspected,
we
want
maintenance
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
they
define
what
the
result
should
be,
and
they
said
in
substance
if
you
don't
do
it,
we
will
do
it
with
federal
employees
and
federal
money.
would
you
agree
they
had
that
kind
of
power?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
isn't
a
question
of
what
may
be
regulated,
but
really
just
the
fact
that
they're
asking
and
the
states
ironically
are
asking
to
have
federal
people
to
come
into
the
states
and
do
this
regulating
of
their
own
citizens.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
different(inaudible)
will
control
the
patronage.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
may
be
you
could
take
it
back
perhaps
on
another
page?
