chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
75-909,
960,
1050,
environmental
protection
agency
v.
brown
and
the
related
cases.
mr.
randolph,
after
reviewing
these
briefs,
it
seems
some
of
the
developments
that
have
come
in
those
briefs,
it
occurs
to
us
that
perhaps
you
and
mr.
lord
will
have
the
lion’s
share
of
the
two
hours
we've
allocated.
you
may
not
need
all
of
that
time,
and
of
course
you
know
there
is
no
compulsion
to
use
it
just
because
it's
been
allocated.
we
leave
that
up
to
your
good
judgment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
carry
that
to
its
logical
conclusion,
most
of
the
highways
in
this
country
are
resting
on
easements
with
a
diversionary
right
to
the
fee
owner.
isn’t
that
so?
so
that
if
you
are
talking
about
the
element
fee
owner,
you
are
talking
about
the
owner
of
the
adjoining
land.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
is
vacated,
it
reverts
back
to
the
fee
owner
of
the
underlying
land.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
closing
the
plant?
i
raised
that
question
before
for
the
incinerator.i
think
they
could
close
the
plant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
blocking
and
closing
the
highway?
you
said
the
sources
are
the
same.
the
highway
is
the
source
in
one
case,
and
the
incinerator
is
the
other.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
randolph,
i
could
understand
your
argument
better
if
you
place
this
on
the
state’s
power
to
license
automobiles,
which
clearly
the
state
has,
i'm
sure
you'd
agree.
now,
would
the
state
have
the
power
to
have
the
emissions
standards
for
each
particular
automobile
as
a
condition
to
getting
a
license
to
drive
the
car?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
does
this
statute
operate
through
that
kind
of
a
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
bolder
than
the
one
you're
making?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
before,
i
thought,
in
response
to
a
question
i
put
that
the
epa
could
close
the
highway
within
the
state.
isn’t
that
a
bolder
claim
than
the
claim
that
they
should
exercise
their
licensing
power
in
a
particular
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
the
injunction
be
the
route
by
which
you
would
carry
out
your
suggestion
that
the
epa
could
close
the
state
highway?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
could
happen,
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
extremely
so
and
it
would
be
particularly
helpful
if
you
and
your
friends
agree,
so
that
there
isn't
any
debate
left
on
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
obviously,
it
was
over-optimistic
on
the
subject.
mr.
hawkins.
mr.
hawkins,
i
think
we
all
hope
you
will
address
yourself
very
early
to
the
statutory
problem.
we
hope
everyone
will
do
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
good.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o’clock.
mr.
hawkins,
i
think
you
have
a
few
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
hawkins.
mr.
maskowitz.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
a
question,
too;
but
i'm
going
to
save
it
for
your
colleague,
because
you're
using
his
time
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
have
a
question
for
you,
and
i'm
going
to
use
some
of
your
colleague’s
time
to
answer
it.
would
you
take
the
same
position
with
respect
to
a
privately
owned
toll
road,
that
the
administrator
cannot
require
the
creation
of
a
bus
lane
on
a
privately
owned
toll
road?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright,
we'll
hear
from
mr.
lord
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
mascowitz.
mr.
lord?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
disposition
to
announce
in
75-909,
environmental
protection
agency
against
governor
brown
of
california
and
the
three
related
and
consolidated
cases
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
for
the
court
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
the
several
judgments
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
are
vacated,
and
the
cases
are
remanded
for
consideration
of
mootness
and
for
such
other
proceedings
as
maybe
consistent
with
this
opinion.
mr.
justice
stevens
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
