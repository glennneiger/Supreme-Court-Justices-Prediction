mr.
henry
r.
lord
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
constitutional
argument
will
attempt
to
track
the
most
recent
metamorphoses
of
the
epa
position
as
reflected
in
the
two
briefs
and
in
the
argument
this
morning.
while
the
shift
in
position
of
epa,
contrary
to
its
statement,
has
been
desperate
and
radical,
the
outcome
does
not
change,
and
the
effect
upon
the
states
possibly
is
even
more
intrusive
than
with
the
regulations
which
were
presented
to
the
circuit
courts
on
petitions
by
the
party
states.
i
think
perhaps
the
way
to
demonstrate
the
difference
would
be
to
turn
to
appendix
a
of
the
brief
that
we
describe
as
sovereign
gold,
and
that's
pages
1a
through
3a.
we
have
set
out
there
an
illustrative
inspection
and
maintenance
program.
it
happens
to
be
the
one
that
was
mandated
for
the
state
of
maryland.
now,
bear
in
mind
that
in
the
metropolitan
baltimore
intrastate
air
quality
control
region,
there
are
approximately
1.1
million
private
vehicles,
light,
medium
and
heavy-duty
vehicles.
i
suppose
the
number
increases
as
much
as
sevenfold
when
you
move
into
the
los
angeles
air
quality
control
region.
now,
looking
at
the
regulation
on
the
first
page,
when
this
becomes
a
federal
regulation
in
all
its
particulars
as
described
by
mr.
randolph
this
morning,
the
essential
change
in
page
1a
will
be
instead
of
saying,
"the
state
of
maryland
shall
establish"
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
"an
inspection
and
maintenance
program",
it
will
say,
"the
state
of
maryland
shall
carry
out
a
federal
inspection
and
maintenance
program".
we
haven't
seen
these
new
regulations,
so
all
we
can
do
is
surmise
as
to
what
they
may
contain;
but
this
would
seem
to
be
logically
following
from
the
positions
stated
in
the
briefs
and
in
argument.
at
the
top
of
page
2a
in
the
fourth
line,
"the
state
will
no
longer
have
any
power
to
exempt
any
category
of
vehicles",
and
i'm
sure
that
any
exemptions
that
exist
would
be
federal
exemptions.
the
business
about
"the
state
shall
submit
within
a
particular
time
period
legally
adopted
regulations"
would
no
longer
be
necessary,
because
the
federal
regulations
would
speak
for
themselves.
now,
all
of
the
operative
provisions,
which
would
be
provisions
(c)1
through
6
on
2a,
(d)
and
(e)
at
the
top
of
page
3a,
would
become
federal
regulations.
reading
down
there,
you
can
see
that
in
2
there
is
a
standard
set.
that's
one
of
the
things
epa
says
it
has
a
right
to
do,
set
a
standard.
it
doesn't
help
you
very
much.
it's
a
little
like
saying
to
a
first-grade
teacher
you
shall
pass
only
70%
of
the
students
on
to
the
second
grade
without
telling
the
teacher
what
sort
of
expectations
as
far
as
the
learning
experience
should
be
instilled
in
that
student.
it
says
that
30%
of
vehicles
shall
be
failed,
it
happens
to
be
50%
of
the
vehicles
in
some
of
the
california
districts.
the
frequency
of
inspection
is
stated
in
1,
and
this
again
would
be
a
new
federal
regulation,
it
says
that
all
vehicles,
all
1.1
million
vehicles,
will
have
to
be
inspected
periodically
no
more
than
one
year
apart.
so
that's
the
standard
and
the
frequency.
we
also
have
a
frequency
provision
down
in
5
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
that
the
first
inspection
cycle
shall
be
in
a
year
that
expired
during
the
time
that
this
case
was
being
considered
by
the
courts.
now,
those
would
be
the
new
federal
regulations.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
your
honor,
those
provisions
i
think
would
be
out
the
same
way
the
earlier
provisions
about
the
state
having
to
submit
within
a
particular
time
at
the
top
of
page
2a,
because
the
state
presumably,
if
we
follow
strictly
the
argument
that
you've
heard
from
epa,
would
not
have
to
adopt
any
legislation
and
would
not
have
to
adopt
any
regulations.
these
would
become
the
state
statutes
and
regulations
in
effect
with
no
further
action
of
the
state
required.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
it
has
not
been
withdrawn,
your
honor.
the
statement
has
been
made
by
epa
and
again
made
here
this
morning
that
they
would
be
withdrawn
and
recast
in
this
new
way
and
i
appreciate
justice
powell’s
problem,
because
frankly
the
states
have
had
the
same
problem
trying
to
prepare
for
this
case.
now,
as
far
as
sanctions
are
concerned,
i
think
we
can
begin
to
see
the
intrusive
nature
of
this
new
approach.
if
you
look
at
3,
it
says,
"these
shall
include"that
would
be
these
provisions
"sanctions
against
individual
owners
and
repair
facilities,
retest
of
failed
vehicles
following
maintenance"
and
then
another
sanction
is
for
people
who
disconnect
devices
between
the
licensing
year.
bear
in
mind
that
in
maryland,
for
example,
the
licensing
year
for
a
vehicle
is
april
1
of
this
year
till
march
31st
of
the
following
year.
there
is
no
safety-inspection
program,
so
this
would
be
a
brand-new
program.
the
only
safety
inspection
in
maryland,
for
example,
is
when
a
vehicle
changes
hands;
a
used
cars
is
sold,
it
has
to
be
inspected.
so
for
the
first
time,
we
have
a
new
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
the
great
majority,
it
is
in
epa’s
brief.
i
think
epa
says
between
five
and
ten
states
have
some
sort
of
an
annual
safety
program.
i
think
virginia
does,
maryland
does
not
happen
to
have
one
and
so
it's
obvious
here
that
despite
what
epa
would
like
to
have
this
court
believe.
the
sanction
here
is
not
merely
a
licensing
sanction
on
an
annual
basis,
the
theory
being,
i
suppose,
that
because
the
state
licenses
already,
it's
not
really
very
much
to
ask
the
state
to
conduct
its
licensing
affairs
in
a
different
way.
there
will
have
to
be
interim
sanctions
against
violators.
presumably,
those
will
be
criminal.
if
someone
has
been
inspected
on
a
monday
and
told
within
two
weeks
that
he
must
bring
his
vehicle
into
compliance,
does
not,
there
has
to
be
an
interim
sanction
there.
it
could
be
a
de-licensing.
i
suspect
that
if
what
he
does
the
second
time
is
to
disconnect
the
devices
he's
placed
upon
his
car,
most
likely
a
criminal
sanction.
where
is
the
source
of
it?
the
source
is
going
to
have
to
be
this
new
federal
regulation,
because
maryland
does
not
happen
to
have
any
legislation
on
that
subject
and
at
this
point
has
not
had
any
reason
to
have
any
legislation
on
the
point.
so
i
think
it's
much
too
seductive
an
argument
to
suggest
that
legislation
is
not
inevitable.
this
program
will
be
one
that
will
have
to
be
managed
by
a
group
of
people.
now,
we've
had
the
helpful
suggestion
from
epa
that
we
can
contact
this
out
and
maybe
even
make
money
on
it.
i
don't
know
that
the
states
have
to
adopt
the
suggestions
made
by
counsel.
obviously,
that
would
have
to
be
considered.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that's
correct,
arizona
has
done
it,
and
i
think
that
there
was
a
referendum
in
november
at
which
that
program
was
approved
and
effective
about
12
days
ago.
that
certainly
is
an
option.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
certainly.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
suppose,
your
honor,
very
many
governmental
programs
could
be
leased
out.
the
whole
budget-making
program,
i
suppose,
could
be
leased
out
to
an
accounting
firm;
but
it
seems
to
me
that
one
of
the
essences
of
sovereignty
is
that
the
states
continue
to
have
the
options
available
to
them
as
to
whether
this
will
be
done
or
whether
it
won't
be
done,
and
to
suggest
that
everything
is
foreclosed
to
a
state
except
the
option
of
hiring
someone
to
carry
out
the
program
i
think
by
its
own
terms
is
intrusive
enough.
now,
when
you
look
at
the
constitutional
framework
of
this
and
bear
in
mind,
we
also
have
had
another
gracious
concession
by
epa
that
despite
the
clear
language
of
section
113,
this
administrator
at
least
will
not
seek
criminal
sanctions
against
states
for
violations
here.
despite
the
fact
that
there's
a
$25,000-a-day
fine
and
a
one-year-in-jail
per-day
fine
or
both,
that
this
administrator
has
decided
that
he
won't
seek
that
against
states.
now,
that's
somewhat
reassuring,
but
hardly
puts
the
case
to
rest.
obviously,
the
injunctive
remedies
here
could
be
very
difficult
for
states
to
live
with.
now,
this
is
advanced
to
this
court
as
a
comprehensive
substitute
transportation-control
plan.
indeed,
that
is
the
only
way
in
which
this
program
could
have
any
federal
authority
whatsoever
under
section
110.
now,
i'll
come
later
to
the
significance
of
this
lack
of
comprehensiveness.
but
turning
to
the
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
should
have
said
that
in
advance.
i
am
assuming
that
we
have
lost
the
statutory
argument.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
don't
think
we
should.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
your
honor,
if
you
read
the
fourth
circuit’s
opinion
and
the
ninth
circuit’s
opinion
carefully,
it's
a
little
hard
to
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
say
this
precisely.
i
should
say,
your
honor,
if
one
read
them
carefully
rather
than
be
as
direct,
i
got
the
direct
impression
that
the
court
had
taken
an
early
look
--
in
fact,
discussed
in
some
detail
the
constitutional
problems
and
had
followed
the
doctrine
that
when
the
constitutional
problems
seem
to
be
overwhelming.
if
there
is
a
way
in
which
the
constitutional
issue
can
be
avoided,
the
court
would
do
it,
and
it
is
clear
that
those
are
based
on
statutory
holdings.
but
i
think
it's
also
clear
that
both
of
those
courts,
if
more
had
been
written,
would
have
found
the
program
as
stated
then,
pre-national
league
of
cities
by
almost
a
year,
both
those
cases
unconstitutional.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
correct,
your
honor
and
turning
to
that,
first
of
all,
there
is
an
irony
that
after
describing
this
new
federal
program,
we
find
that
the
only
way
that
the
federal
government
has
gotten
to
the
point
of
having
authority
to
do
it
is
through
the
mechanism
of
a
prior
finding
several
years
ago
that
the
states
didn't
have
sufficient
authority
to
do
this
themselves,
that
they
had
not
presented
enough.
so
the
states
were
told
and
we're
all
told
back
in
1973
that
they
had
not
produced
enough
authority
to
carry
out
the
program.
that
was
the
exciting
cause,
if
you
will,
of
the
intrusion
of
the
federal
government.
now,
we're
told
that
these
regulations
have
been
withdrawn
and
that
there's
been
inherent
federal
authority
all
along
to
do
this
through
federal
regulations.
now,
the
point
was
brought
up
by
justice
stevens
about
a
swarm
of
federal
officials
coming
into
the
states
and
perhaps
being
more
intrusive
if
not
in
a
constitutional
sense,
in
a
governmental
sense,
than
what
we
are
opposing
today.
that,
i
can
only
say,
is
a
possibility.
apparently,
the
federal
government,
perhaps
based
on
the
prohibition
experience,
has
decided
that
that
is
not
what
it
wants
to
do,
that
it
will
not
take
that
issue
on.
we
don't
know
why
and
we
haven't
been
informed;
but
our
position
constitutionally
is,
just
as
mr.
mascowitz
said,
that
the
federal
government
has
ample
authority
to
take
this
program
over
itself.
in
fact,
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
federal
government
could
preempt
this
entire
program,
carry
it
out
through
federal
funds
and
federal
employees
and
by
a
notice
some
time
prior
to
the
licensing
expiration
period
in
a
state
notify
a
state
that
x
vehicle
is
not
yet
in
compliance
and
the
state
would
then
have
to
use
in
that
limited
intrusion
its
licensing
function
to
not
issue
a
state
license.
we
happen
to
feel
that
that
would
not
be
so
intrusive
as
to
be
constitutionally
violative.
anything
short
of
that,
however,
would
be.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that's
correct,
but
then
the
question
comes
up,
and
we've
talked
about
this,
as
to
whether
that
would
require
a
separate
federal
registration
and
licensing
or
whether
that
could
be
carried
out
and
executed
through
the
state
licensing
function.
our
conclusion
is,
even
though
perhaps
it's
a
concession
that
we
don't
have
to
make,
that
the
federal
government
could
use
the
existing
licensing
and
de-licensing
mechanism
of
the
states
with
the
feds.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
sure,
that's
right,
but
it
could
then
say
to
the
states
if
the
vehicle
coming
in
for
licensing
does
not
have
the
federal
sticker,
you
cannot
give
it
tags,
that's
my
point.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
there
would
be
the
additional
sanctions
of
the
state
against
the
vehicle.
that's
all,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
right,
we
may
have
to
have
the
swarm
that
justice
stevens
was
concerned
about.
now,
i
think
it's
interesting
that
the
epa
has
said
to
this
court
this
morning
that
no
constitutional
source
was
cited
for
the
1973
regulations
and
all
of
these
regulations
and
this
whole
theory
was
conceived
of
in
the
latter
half
of
1973,
within
10
months
after
epa
lost
nrdc
v.
epa.
that's
simply
not
the
case.
in
fact,
right
in
the
preamble
to
the
administrator’s
theories,
which
have
been
discussed
at
length
today,
is
a
citation
to
united
states
v.
california
as
the
authority
for
what
it
is
doing.
in
fact,
us
v.
california
was
so
appealing
to
epa
that
in
its
brief
in
chief,
united
states
v.
california
was
cited
four
times.
the
united
states
v.
california
decision
is
really
more
helpful
to
the
states
than
it
is
to
the
epa
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
in
the
california
case,
there
was
a
railroad
owned
by
the
state
of
california
that
connected
45
state-owned
wharves
in
san
francisco
with
a
bunch
of
industrial
users
some
distance
away
at
an
interstate
railroad.
it
charged
for
the
service,
just
like
any
private
railroad
would
have;
and
as
such,
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
valid
distinction
between
what
california
was
doing
and
what
a
private
railroad
was
doing.
what
we
have
here
is
the
support
for
our
conclusion
that
state
facilities
are
in
no
way
exempted
from
the
clean
air
act.
in
fact,
state
facilities
are
included;
but
it's
not
the
type
of
state
facility
that
epa
would
urge
this
court
to
include.
it
would
be
if
the
state
did
own
an
incinerator,
which
it
doesn't,
that's
a
traditionally
municipal
function,
or
a
sewage
treatment
plant,
which
it
doesn't
--
again
a
traditionally
local
or
municipal
function,
those
would
be
covered.
the
most
obvious
example
and
the
perfect
parallel
to
united
states
v.
california
is
the
state
auto
fleet.
every
state
owns
a
fleet
of
vehicles.
if
those
vehicles
are
polluting,
those
vehicles
can
be
reached
under
this
act
and
can
be
constitutionally
reached.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
yes,
the
state
as
the
operator
of
a
state
auto
fleet
can
be
treated
just
as
a
private
industrial
owner
that
owned
a
fleet
of
vehicles.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
these
vehicles
are
in
violation.
now,
once
again,
i'm
passing
the
statutory
argument
here;
but
constitutionally,
the
state
could
be
told
that
those
vehicles
must
be
brought
into
compliance,
and
the
full
enforcement
power
of
the
federal
government
could
be
brought
against
it.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
your
honor,
without
trying
to
reopen
all
the
argument
about
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
alright,
constitutionally.
constitutionally,
the
state
is
being
regulated
itself.
it's
not
told
to
go
regulate
someone
else.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
no,
your
honor,
with
all
due
respect,
that's
not
correct.
the
state
owns
them,
and
the
state
maintains
them
through
state
garages
and
the
simple
direction
is
that
the
state
must
take
steps
to
bring
its
own
vehicles
into
compliance.
it's
not
regulating
any
third
persons
at
all.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
the
difference,
your
honor,
is
that
in
this
case
the
state
is
not
being
told
to
bring
its
own
roads
into
compliance;
it's
being
told
to
bring
the
drivers
of
vehicles
which
may
happen
to
use
state
roads
into
compliance.
the
federal
government
has
decided
that
it
is
not
going
to
enforce
the
program.
i
don't
know
whether
appropriations
were
not
available
or
just
appropriations
were
not
sought;
but
that
was
obviously
a
conscious
governmental
decision.
epa
had
to
cast
around,
or
congress,
for
a
police
power
somewhere
to
enforce
this
statute.
it
spotted
the
police
power
of
the
states,
and
then
it
conscripted
it.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
no,
i
am
glad
you
brought
that
up,
because
i
have
just
drawn
a
distinction
without
explaining
its
significance.
obviously,
when
you're
talking
about
a
municipality
or
a
county
or
a
township,
they
do
not
share
the
tenth
and
eleventh
amendment
protections
that
a
state
has,
and
they
cannot
urge
on
this
court
with
any
degree
of
success
--
at
least,
they've
never
been
able
to
do
so
in
the
past.
the
state’s
sovereignty
arguments
available
to
a
state.
fire
and
police
protection
have
been
essentially
local
matters,
and
so
i
don't
think
they
really
fall
within
the
example
that
i
gave.
i
do
think
that
the
state
auto
fleet.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
may
be,
your
honor;
but
i
do
think
constitutionally
that
that's
correct.is
it
in
this
case?
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
would
have
a
great
trouble
with
that.
i
think
to
the
extent
that
it
doesn't
require
operation
on
anyone
else,
even
another
state
employee
in
the
form
of
a
sanction,
i
think
it's
unconstitutional.
once
it
gets
beyond
that,
i'm
afraid
it
gets
into
a
dangerous
area.
now,
the
arguments
that
i'm
presenting
today
are
hardly
novel.
in
fairness,
we
have
been
waiting
with
bated
breath
to
receive
the
reply
brief
from
the
federal
government
which
we
received
on
monday
to
see
if
they
were
at
that
point
able
to
find
a
single
case
that
stood
for
the
proposition
that
they
espouse,
and
they
have
not.
it's
clear
that
there
is
no
case
which
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
commerce
clause
can
be
used
to
dragoon
the
police
power
of
a
sovereign
state.
now,
analogies
have
been
flying
around
this
courtroom
and
through
the
briefs
and
as
recently
as
the
reply
brief
that
indicate
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
think
so
in
the
broadest
sense,
your
honor.
whether
it's
police
power
in
getting
someone
out
of
an
exclusive
bus
lane
and
telling
him
that
he's
got
to
pull
over
and
be
fined
or
ticketed.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
right,
or
going
back
to
the
maryland
v.
wirtz
line
and
the
national
league
of
cities
line,
the
whole
governance
of
a
state
and
the
decision-making
in
the
state
and
the
budget-making
function,
and
which
programs
will
advance
and
which
will
not
advance,
is
part
of
the
exercise
of
the
police
power
for
the
benefit
of
the
health,
the
safety
and
welfare
of
the
population
of
the
states.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
which
means
that
if
he
can
own
it,
he
can
also
shut
it
down
or
limit
access
to
it.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
i
have
a
great
deal
of
problem
with
the
proposition
that
the
state
could,
for
example,
declare
a
moratorium
on
new-car
registrations.
