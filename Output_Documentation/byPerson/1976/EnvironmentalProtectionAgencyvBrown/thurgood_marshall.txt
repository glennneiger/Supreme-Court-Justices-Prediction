doesn't
travel
down

in
which
the
state
doesn't
own.
justice
thurgood

i'm
having
trouble
with
the
owner
of
the
pollutant
still,
with
my
brother
stevens
and
some
others.
you
said
that
states
could
not
be
required
to
close
down
the
smelter
plant
or
anything
else.
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
anything
like
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
federal
government
can
compel
the
state
to
close
down
a
private
automobile.
and
the
difference
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
believe
either.
i
don't
have
to
believe
either,
do
i?
we've
got
before
us
--
you
really
are
aiming
at
the
automobile,
which
is
not
owned
by
the
state.
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
page
5-a
of
the
appendix
to
your
brief,
i
think
it
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
take
shirley
highway
as
a
garage.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
suggest
that
the
epa
could
order
the
owner
of
the
shopping
center
to
establish
an
inspection
system
on
all
vehicles
coming
into
the
shopping
center
to
check
them
for
air
pollution,
is
that?
…
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
should
he
abandon
his
parking
lot,
could
he
be
required
to
abandon
his
parking
lot
in
order
to
eliminate
this
problem?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
mascowitz,
getting
back
to
my
brother
stevens’
question,
if
you've
got
a
steel
plant
and
a
huge
parking
lot
and
it's
discovered
that
two-thirds
of
the
pollution
in
that
area
comes
from
the
plant,
you'd
have
no
problem
with
that,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
you
do.
you'd
tell
them
to
clean
it
up
and
one-third
comes
from
the
parking
lot
that
you
can't
touch.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
way
you
take
that
position?
there's
no
way
for
you
to
take
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
let's
get
to
another
one.
what
about
the
bus
lanes?
that
is
in
the
control
of
the
state.
right,
it
is;
it
is.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
what's
the
answer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let's
hear
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
agree
that
the
bus
lane
is
a
good
idea?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
think
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
disagree
with
epa,
i
thought
you
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
could
have
private
inspections.
justice
thurgood
marshall
several
states
have
done
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
lord,
are
you
giving
away
too
much
in
your
agreement
as
to
the
state
could
have
to
do
something
on
its
own
vehicles?
do
you
include
fire
and
police
in
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
federal
government
can
--
are
you
going
that
far?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
lord,
following
up
on
justice
stevens’
question
for
a
minute,
if
the
federal
government
sets
out
to
reach
this
fleet
of
motorcars
that's
operated
by
the
state
as
you
concede
it
may,
can
the
administrator
say
to
the
state
you
shall
fine
every
driver
who
does
not
keep
his
vehicle
in
compliance
with
applicable
federal
standards
not
less
than
$100?
