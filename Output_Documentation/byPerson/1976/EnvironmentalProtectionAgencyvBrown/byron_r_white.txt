justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
randolph,
is
there
some
separate,
narrower
issue
in
the
case
--
i
take
it
there
is
--
as
to
whether
a
state
is
required
to
enforce
a
federal
prohibition?
i
take
it
from
your
brief
you're
not
saying
that
the
state
has
to
pass
any
law
or
any
regulation
or
anything
like
that,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
your
total
claim
that
we
have
some
federal
prohibitions
that
the
administrator
is
going
to
reissue
some
plan
and
there
are
just
going
to
be
some
prohibitions?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
do
want
something
more
than
the
court
to
hold
that
a
state
must
enforce
a
federal
prohibition,
let's
say
the
national
speed
limit.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
take
the
national
speed
limit.
is
the
state
required
to
enforce
the
national
speed
limit?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
be
a
constitutional
question
in
part,
but
it
might
also
be
a
statutory
question
in
the
sense
that
anytime
congress
passes
a
law,
you
ought
to
infer
that
they
intend
the
states
to
enforce
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say,
then,
and
what
you're
arguing,
then,
is
that
you
think
congress
has
said
that
if
the
administrator
wants
to
require
the
state
to
enforce
these
new
requirements,
he
may
do
so.
