but
you've
gone
over
that
pretty
quickly
as
i
say
they
own
the
pollution
sources
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
sewers,
effluents
put
in
there
by
private
people.
justice
potter
stewart
without
sparkplugs,
you
wouldn't
have
auto
pollution.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
of
course,
nobody
questions
that.
the
question
here
is
whether
congress
has
authorized
the
administrator
to
require
the
states
to
enforce
his
plan.
no
one
questions
the
administrator
can
promulgate
his
own
plan
and
enforce
it
if
he
finds
the
state’s
plan
is
not
adequate
but
it
is
a
question
of
whether
he
can
force
the
states
to
enforce
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
provide
all
of
the
inspectors
and
the
police
and
so
forth
to
carry
out
his
plan
rather
than
having
the
federal
government
provide
those
people
in
the
implementation
of
the
federal
plan,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
during
the
second
world
war,
we
managed
to
have
opa
federal
officials
in
every
hamlet
during
those
various
times
we've
been
at
war.
we've
had
draft
boards,
which,
you
know,
the
salutation
was,
"you've
been
chosen
by
a
board
consisting
of
your
friends
and
neighbors",
and
that's
who
they
were.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
question
is
whether
congress
has
authorized
what
the
epa
administrator
has
done.
justice
potter
stewart
the
first
question.
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
leave
the
statute,
let's
take
the
simple
case
of
the
municipally
operated
incinerator,
which
everybody
agrees
in
this
case
is
subject
to
the
statute.
so
the
administrator
establishes
criteria
for
standards
for
ambient
air,
both
primary
and
secondary
pollution,
and
the
state
comes
in
with
a
plan
that
is
found
by
the
administrator
to
be
deficient
insofar
as
it
regulates
municipally
owned
and
operated
incinerators
in
the
state.
is
it
all
that
clear
under
the
statute
that
the
administrator
can
then
say
to
the
state,
“your
problem
is
that
you
don't
have
stringent
enough
laws
or
ordinances,
and
so
you
go
and
enact
those
in
controlling
municipally
operated
incinerators”.
justice
potter
stewart
if
there,
i
think
it
is
clear
despite
the
disclaimers
that
there
has
been
some
change
of
position
by
the
government
in
the
course
of
these,
i
beg
to
differ
with
you.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
not.
justice
potter
stewart
we're
not
talking
about
forced
actions
now,
we're
talking
about...
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
is
the
answer,
then,
to
my
question?
let's
assume
that
the
state
regulation
of
these
municipal
incinerators
is
deficient
in
the
opinion
of
the
administrator.
then
what
can
he
do,
just
as
a
matter
of
statutory
authority
before
you
get
to
any
constitutional
questions?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
he
has
gone
much
further
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
roads
and
highways,
hasn’t
he?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
much
more
detail,
much
more
direction
to
the
states,
than
you
told
me
he
could
do
with
respect
to
the
incinerator.
all
you
said
he
could
do
with
the
incinerator
is
just
reduce
the
amount
of
these
particulate
pollution-causing
materials.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
you
think
he
could
do
that.
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
i'm
quite
mistaken,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
is
fairly
important.
what
can
he
do
beginning
with
a
government-operated
incinerator
that
everybody
agrees
can
be
and
is
subject
to
regulations?
justice
potter
stewart
let's
say
you
have
some
regulations
having
to
do
with
how
many
scrubbers
there
should
be,
and
you
have
to
appropriate
money
if
there
is
an
insufficient
number
of
scrubbers
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
closing
down
the
plant,
because
the
scrubbers
aren't
given
away,
you
know.
