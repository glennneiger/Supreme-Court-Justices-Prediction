justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mascowitz,
what
would
be
your
view
of
an
administratorâ€™s
regulation
that
did
not
require
the
state
to
establish
a
bus
lane,
but
simply
said
no
more
than
x
amount
of
exhaust
emissions
shall
be
permitted
per
given
linear
mile
of
freeway
and
if
the
state
wants
to
do
it
by
putting
in
a
bus
lane,
fine;
if
they
want
to
put
it
by
limiting
the
cars
on
the
highway,
fine.
would
you
view
that
differently
than
the
bus-lane
regulation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
government's
withdrawn
that,
though,
haven't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lord,
could
i
interrupt?
i
think
it's
relevant
to
your
colloquy
with
justice
stewart.
your
analogy
to
the
california
case
suggests
that
what
you're
arguing
is
something
like
this,
that
to
the
extent
that
the
state
is
an
owner
of
a
road
and
therefore
there's
power
over
it,
like
the
owner
of
a
factory
parking
lot,
it
may
be
compelled
to
do
things
which
other
owners
might
be
compelled
to
do;
but
it
may
not
be
compelled
to
exercise
governmental
powers
which
private
owners
don't
have.
it
couldn't
exercise
the
criminal
sanctions
and
so
forth.
is
that
the
essence
of
what
you're
saying?
