mr.
david
g.
hawkins
indeed
i
will,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
unanimous
on
wanting
clean
air,
so
let's
focus
on
the
statute.
mr.
david
g.
hawkins
your
honor,
the
citizen
groups
intervened
in
the
court
below
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
support
of
epa
because
of
their
view,
which
we're
glad
to
hear
the
court
shares,
that
the
statute
promotes
for
clean
air
and
that
the
epa
regulations
are
the
only
practical
way
of
achieving
that
important
objective.
so
to
the
statutory
question,
is
it
reasonable
to
regard
a
highway
as
a
source
of
pollution,
and
mr.
justice
stevens
put
it
well
in
asking
what
is
the
specific
statutory
authority.
what
is
it
that
talks
about
the
state’s
duty
as
a
polluter
of
the
atmosphere?
well,
it
is
the
same
section
which
talks
about
any
source’s
duty,
and
that
is
the
section
which
empowers
epa
to
promulgate
regulations
in
the
event
that
a
state
does
not
submit
an
adequate
plan.
that
section
is
section
110(c)
of
the
act.
it
is
set
forth
at
epa’s
brief
at
page
9a.
what
it
says
is
that
the
administrator
shall
set
forth,
promptly
prepare
and
publish
proposed
regulations
setting
forth
an
implementation
plan.
now,
that
implementation
plan
must
contain
emission
limitations,
which
although
it
doesn't
say
so
in
section
110(a),
are
applicable
to
pollution
sources.
the
question
then
is,
is
it
reasonable
to
regard
a
highway
as
a
pollution
source?
i
think
the
difficulty
that
many
people
have
had
is
that
the
highway
is
owned
by
the
states
and,
as
such,
it
is
difficult
to
perceive
it
as
a
pollution
source.
so
let's
look
at
some
similar
types
of
sources
which
are
owned
by
private
parties.
for
example,
let
us
take
a
garage
which
performs
tune-ups
on
automobiles.
those
automobiles
are
owned
by
the
individuals
that
bring
those
cars
in.
however,
the
idling
emissions
may
be
substantial,
especially
for
very
large
garages.
similarly,
a
private
garage
which
perhaps
stores
buses
or
is
a
bus
terminal.
the
buses
are
owned
by
another
party;
but
the
garage
itself
may
collect
emissions,
concentrate
emissions
and
allow
the
problem
to
be
created.
this
is
what
a
highway
does,
in
that
it
determines
the
location
of
motor-vehicle
activity.
it
concentrates
that
motor-vehicle
activity
to
a
degree
where
the
problem
is
created.
mr.
david
g.
hawkins
i
would
take
shirley
--
mr.
justice
marshall,
there's
one
exception,
and
that
is
the
bus
lane
on
shirley
highway,
which
moves
very
well,
and
that's
what
we're
aiming
at.
let's
look
at
some
others.
is
a
shopping
center
where
people
circulate,
idling
their
cars
for
hours
on
end
trying
to
find
a
parking
space
during
a
preholiday
sale,
is
that
a
source
of
pollution;
or
is
it
fair
for
the
shopping-center
operator
to
insist
that
any
community
that
adjoins
the
shopping
center
must
go
after
the
individual
vehicles
that
circulate
and
are
collected
and
are
attracted
to
that
shopping
center?
mr.
david
g.
hawkins
we
believe
there
are
precedents
which
would
establish
just
that
type
of
responsibility,
and
i'd
like
to
turn
to
some
of
those.
mr.
david
g.
hawkins
well,
what
the
epa
actually
did,
your
honor,
was
to
require
that
the
shopping
centers
develop
their
parking
lots
in
ways
that
would
not
produce
pollution
problems
that
are
associated
with
the
use.
mr.
david
g.
hawkins
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
the
remaining
moments,
i'd
like
to
just
make
two
points.
first,
it
is
logical
to
regard
highways
as
sources
of
air
pollution
and,
second,
congress
intended
that
they
be
regarded
as
sources
of
air
pollution.
i'd
like
to
touch
on
the
second
point
first,
congressional
intent.
i
want
to
call
the
justices’
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
1974,
after
epa
promulgated
the
regulations
here
in
issue,
congress
considered
amendments
to
the
clean
air
act
in
a
comprehensive
energy
bill.
those
amendments
were
passed
in
june
of
1974,
and
one
pertinent
amendment
is
in
the
government’s
brief
at
page
12a.
it
amended
section
110
of
the
act
to
address
epa's
authority
to
promulgate
the
very
types
of
regulations
here
in
issue,
namely,
bus
lanes.
large
paragraph
e
on
page
12a
specifies
that
basically
no
regulation
relating
to
management
of
parking
supply
or
preferential
bus/carpool
lanes
shall
be
promulgated
after
the
date
of
enactment
of
this
paragraph
unless
there
are
locally
conducted
public
hearings.
so
congress
addressed
this
issue.
its
only
concern
about
bus
lanes
was
not
that
it
was
irrational
to
regard
the
highway
as
a
source,
but
simply
that
there
hadn't
been
adequate
public
participation
in
some
of
the
bus
lanes
that
had
been
promulgated
up
to
that
point.
however,
congress
didn't
even
require
that
those
bus-lane
regulations
be
rescinded.
instead,
in
the
conference
report,
as
is
pointed
out
in
the
government’s
brief
at
page
35,
the
conference
report
specifically
endorsed
the
existing
bus-lane
regulations
and
simply
required
a
procedural
safeguard
for
future
bus-lane
regulations.
mr.
david
g.
hawkins
that's
right,
your
honor.
congress
addressed
a
number
of
areas
with
respect
to
epa’s
regulation
of
transportation
sources
of
pollution.
in
some
respects,
they
removed
epa’s
authority,
that
is,
parking
surcharges.
in
other
cases,
they
limited
it
procedurally.
but
in
no
case
did
they
question
the
rationality
of
regarding
the
highway
as
a
source
of
pollution,
nor
did
they
question
the
epa’s
specific
regulations
which
were
on
the
books,
available
and
indeed
in
great
issue
at
that
time.
mr.
david
g.
hawkins
yes,
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
in
fact,
an
amendment
was
introduced
to
prohibit
the
implementation
of
bus
lanes.
that
was
passed
by
the
house;
however,
it
was
deleted
in
conference,
and
the
reasons
the
conferees
deleted
that
provision
are
stated
in
the
government’s
brief
at
page
35
and
36.
they
said
we
do
not
intend
to
question
epa’s
authority
to
implement
these
regulations.
mr.
david
g.
hawkins
that
was
not
addressed,
but
epa’s
regulations
were
clear,
they
had
been
in
all
the
newspapers
and
they
had
been
submitted
in
testimony
on
the
legislation,
and
the
states
were
raising
quite
a
bit
of
opposition
to
it.
so
congress
knew
what
the
issue
was,
and
as
i
say,
the
only
thing
they
did
was
act
to
limit
epa’s
ability
to
promulgate
new
bus
lanes
by
requiring
some
additional
public
hearings.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
this
is
not
all
post-enactment
legislative
history.
on
the
same
day
that
the
clean
air
act
was
passed,
the
clean
air
amendments
of
1970,
congress
also
amended
the
federal
aid
highway
act.
in
23
usc
section
109(j),
which
is
referred
to
in
our
reply
brief,
congress
specified
that
all
federal
aid
highways
had
to
be
consistent
with
air-quality
implementation
plans.
so,
again,
there
is
congressional
recognition
that
is
coincident
with
the
passage
of
the
original
amendments
that
a
highway
indeed
can
be
a
source
of
pollution.
mr.
david
g.
hawkins
this
directed
the
secretary
of
transportation
to
promulgate
regulations.
the
secretary
of
transportation
has
promulgated
regulations.
we
think
they're
inadequate.
the
regulations
provide
that
no
future
highway
monies
would
be
available
to
a
state.
just
concluding
with
the
logic
of
regarding
highways
or
other
vehicle
facilities
as
sources,
i'd
would
submit
that
griggs
v.
allegheny
county,
a
decision
of
this
court,
recognized
that
an
airport
is
a
source
of
pollution,
noise
pollution
in
that
case.
the
planes
were
causing
the
noise
pollution;
but
the
airport
owner,
which
in
fact
was
a
county,
was
held
responsible.
in
cases
involving
interpretation
of
the
federal
railroad
safety
appliance
act,
a
railroad,
not
as
the
owner
of
vehicles,
but
merely
as
a
track
owner,
was
held
liable
in
u.s.
v.
toledo
railroad,
which
is
in
our
brief
at
page
8,
was
held
liable
for
the
safety
defects
in
the
cars
owned
and
hauled
by
another
railroad
corporation
and
as
i
say,
the
basis
of
liability
in
that
case
and
the
basis
of
liability
in
the
statute
is
that
the
person
was
a
track
owner.
in
this
case,
the
state
is
also
a
track
owner
--
it
happens
to
be
a
concrete
track
rather
than
a
steel
track
and
we
think
there's
no
constitutional
significance
in
the
fact
that
we
have
steel
on
rails
in
one
case
and
rubber
on
concrete
in
another.
thank
you
very
much.
