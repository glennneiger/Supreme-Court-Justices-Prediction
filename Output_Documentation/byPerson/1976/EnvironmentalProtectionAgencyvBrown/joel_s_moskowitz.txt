mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
solicitor
general
has
attempted
to
persuade
this
court
that
the
administrator
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
has
both
statutory
and
constitutional
authority
to
predetermine
and
control
state
transportation
policies.
to
prevail
in
this
case,
he's
going
to
have
to
persuade
the
court
of
the
correctness
of
his
position
on
both
of
these
issues.
i'm
going
to
address
myself
to
the
statutory
issues,
and
my
colleague,
mr.
lord
of
maryland,
will
discuss
the
constitutional
issues.
the
environmental
protection
agency
in
its
latest
position
which
it
takes
before
this
court
now
seems
to
recognize
that
it
may
only
regulate
polluters;
and
to
justify
its
attempt
to
regulate
state
policies
and
activities,
it
characterizes
the
states
as
polluters,
because
they
own
and
maintain
highways
which,
it
is
asserted,
are
indirect
sources
of
pollution.
the
notion
of
indirect
source
of
pollution,
i
think,
was
developed
somewhat
more
in
epa’s
briefs
than
it
was
at
oral
argument,
and
i
think
perhaps
we
should
give
a
little
more
attention
to
it
here,
because
it
is
the
slim
thread
upon
which
this
entire
statutory
scheme
is
founded,
the
notion
of
indirect
source;
so
we
ought
to
step
back
a
little
bit
and
ask
where
this
notion
that
a
highway
is
an
indirect
source
of
pollution,
precisely
where
does
that
come
from.
the
first
thing
you
notice
about
the
term
"indirect
source"
is
that
it
is
not
found
anywhere
in
the
statute.
nowhere
in
the
clean
air
act
do
we
read
anything
not
only
about
a
highway
being
an
indirect
source,
but
the
term
"indirect
source"
is
not
found
in
the
statute.
the
basis
for
the
notion
of
indirect
source
at
all,
in
fact,
is
submitted
by
epa
to
be
an
essay
by
the
administrator
as
a
preamble
to
some
regulations,
and
this
is
the
only
basis
we're
given
in
the
regulations
for
the
concept
of
indirect
source.
now,
interestingly
enough,
there
was
in
the
regulations
--
in
fact,
there
still
is.
there
is
a
regulation
actually
defining
"indirect
source",
and
you'll
find
it
in
the
parking
regulations,
the
one
…
they
describe
the
present
status
of
that
regulation
as
its
operation
has
now
been
suspended
due,
of
course,
to
the
interposition
of
congress.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
no,
indeed
there
is.
what
we're
trying
to
show
now
is
the
chain
of
reasoning
by
which
it
is
established
that
a
highway
is
an
indirect
source
of
pollution
and
that
state
policies
with
respect
to
those
highways
can
be
the
proper
subject
of
legislation.
so
what
i'm
demonstrating
now
is
that
starting
with
no
concrete
anchor
in
the
statute,
we
are
then
given
the
concept
of
indirect
source
and
how
that
concept
has
been
utilized
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
well,
i
don't
really
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
there's
a
power
to
regulate
any
indirect
source,
because
--
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
well,
i
haven't
really
addressed
the
question
of
whether
there's
power
to
regulate
any
indirect
source.
what
we're
showing
is
that
if
there
is
power
to
regulate
an
indirect
source,
that
power
does
not
extend
to
regulating
states’
transportation
policies
as
an
indirect
source.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
i
agree
entirely.
frankly,
your
honor,
i
don't
see
anywhere
in
the
statute
where
"indirect
source"
is
addressed
at
all
and
i'm
being
cautious
on
that
ground,
simply
because
it's
a
question
the
states
don't
have
to
reach.
i
am
certainly
not
conceding
anything;
i
am
simply
not
addressing
that.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
i
think
the
short
answer,
your
honor,
is,
i
don't
see
it
in
the
statutes.
i
don't
see
it.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
oh,
we
indeed
agree
on
that
point
and
that
it's
only
--
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
it's
my
position
simply
because
i
haven't
located
the
power
in
the
statute.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
it
seems
to
me
i
agree,
and
conceivably,
obviously,
he
has
done
that,
but
i
think
the
question
that
i
would
like
to
proceed
with
in
order
to
fully
answer
your
question
is
that
we
have
to
understand
what
an
indirect
source
is.
in
order
to
find
--
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
it
isn't
the
purest
example.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
it
isn't
the
purest
example,
because
in
that
particular
instance
the
owner
of
the
repair
shop
would
be
creating
the
fumes
through
manipulating
the
cars
directly,
which
isn't
what
the
states
are
doing
in
this
case.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
rather
than
give
examples,
i
think
the
most
helpful
thing
i
could
do
is
to
tell
you
what
epa
says
it
is
and
then
maybe
using
that,
because
it's
their
concept,
and
rather
than
us
trying
to
figure
out
what
it
could
be,
we
can
see
what
epa
said
it
is.
in
fact,
they
have
defined
it
and
you
can
find
it
in
the
regulations,
which
incidentally
have
not
been
cited
by
epa,
interestingly.
but
the
regulations
defining
"indirect
source"
would
be
focused
very
narrowly
on
what
the
definition
is.
it
is
found
in
40
cfr,
section
52.22(b),
and
i
will
read
it
because
it
is
very
short.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
it
has
not
been
cited
by
epa,
and
we
have
discovered
it
only
belatedly
because,
as
we
said,
it
was
tied
to
regulation
of
new
parking
structures.
its
operation
has
been
suspended,
whatever
that
means,
and
so
we
didn't
discover
it
until
recently.
but
that's...
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
surely;
40
cfr,
section
52.22(b)
and
what
this
says,
it's
very
short:
"the
term
'indirect
source'
means
a
facility,
building,
structure
or
installation
which
attracts,
or
may
attract,
mobile
source
activity
that
results
in
emissions
of
a
pollutant
for
which
there
is
a
national
standard.
such
indirect
sources
include,
but
are
not
limited
to",
and
then
seven
examples
follow.
i
think
it's
worthwhile
to
pay
a
little
bit
of
attention
to
what
those
examples
are.
they
include
retail
commercial
and
industrial
facilities;
recreation,
amusement,
sports
and
entertainment
facilities;
airports;
office
and
governmental
buildings;
apartment
and
condominium
buildings;
education
facilities.
what
basically
epa
is
saying
is
that
any
place
which
anyone
could
ever
want
to
get
to
for
any
purpose
which
is
a
manmade
structure
or
facility
is
an
indirect
source.
it
includes
virtually
every
manmade
object
within
the
jurisdiction
of
epa.
it
is
a
very,
very
broad
and
sweeping
concept
and
certainly
represents
an
expansive
view
of
epa’s
powers.
now,
interestingly,
one
of
the
examples
given
in
this
commodious
list
of
what
an
indirect
source
is
and
the
reason
i
wanted
to
read
that,
i
think
it
shows
you
that
it
is
far
more
than
garages;
it
is
everything.
this
building
is
an
indirect
source.
everything
is
an
indirect
source.
but
the
curious
thing
is
that
also
included
on
the
list
of
indirect
sources
are
highways
and
roads.
that,
in
fact,
is
interestingly
given
as
the
very
first
example.
there's
a
difference
between
highways
and
roads
and
all
these
other
indirect
sources.
as
i
indicated,
the
other
examples
that
are
given
are
destinations,
a
place
to
which
a
person
might
want
to
go.
he
is
attracted
to
those
destinations,
such
as
having
to
go
to
work
he
is
attracted
to
work,
and
then
after
work
he's
attracted
to
going
back
home;
he
is
attracted
to
the
supermarket
and
maybe
to
the
ballpark.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
well,
the
difference
between
being
attracted
to
the
highway
and
being
attracted
to
his
destination
is
that
the
highway
is
the
means
of
going
to
the
indirect
source.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
the
indianapolis
speedway
is
under
this
definition
clearly
an
indirect
source.
the
sole
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
here
is
that
unlike
the
other
examples
of
indirect
sources,
unless
one
is
a
street
dragster
or,
maybe
in
the
case
of
the
indianapolis
highway,
a
racecar
driver,
few
people
are
intrinsically
attracted
to
highways.
so
the
difference
between
them
and
i'm
only
showing
this
difference
to
show
how
there
is
this
drift
from
the
statutory
grounding.
the
difference
is
is
that
the
highway
we
could
perhaps
term
as
an
indirect
indirect
source.
it
enables
one
to
get
to
an
indirect
source.
it
is
not
an
intrinsic
attraction;
it
serves
as
the
means
by
which
one
would
get
to
the
intrinsic
attraction.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
well,
of
course,
the
sewer
example,
we
have
two
dimensions
to
the
sewer
example,
and
i
suppose
they're
not
trying
to
regulate
that
as
an
indirect
source
here.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
i
suppose
the
constitutional
question's
as
to
whether
that
analysis
would
apply
and
is
proper
in
this
regards.
the
point
that
we're
trying
to
make
here
is
that
the
concept
of
the
highway
as
an
indirect
source
is
not
statutorily
grounded.
whether
congress
could
have
written
it
in
as
they
wrote
in
sewers
or
as
the
federal
common
law
considered
sewers
is
maybe
a
question
we
don't
have
to
consider
now.
but
i
think
the
point
that
i've
made
so
far
is
that
highways
are
at
best
an
indirect
indirect
source.
but
as
the
sole
authority
for
epa’s
application
of
its
concept
of
indirect
source
makes
plain,
namely,
the
administrator,
it
doesn't
stop
there
with
solely
saying
that
the
highway
is
an
indirect
source.
rather,
it
uses
the
concept
that
the
highway
is
a
source
of
pollution
as
a
springboard
for
its
next
step
and
the
administrator
in
his
preface
says
that
what
he's
concerned
about
is
not
so
much
the
existence
of
highways.
what
he's
concerned
about
is
that
the,“regulatory
taxing
and
investment
decisions
made
at
all
levels
of
government
which
encourage
the
use
of
highways
by
automobiles
are
also
indirect
sources”.
he
cites
his
indirect
sources
as
particular
examples:
licensing
vehicles
and
operators,
providing
a
system
of
traffic
laws,
as
well
as
not
making
choices
which
would
have
discouraged
the
use
of
single-passenger
automobiles
and
encouraged
the
use
of
mass
transit.
so
there's
a
certain
shift
here
from
the
physical
objects
which
may
attract
someone
to
go
in
a
mobile
source
of
pollution,
namely,
a
car,
which
as
we
indicated
includes
everything
in
the
known
universe.
there's
a
shift
to
state
policies
which
encourage
the
use
of
these
automobiles
as
opposed
to
mass
transit
and
state
involvement
not
solely
as
an
owner,
because
the
owner
concept
is
what's
been
stressed
before
this
court,
but
the
focus
as
set
forth
by
the
administrator
himself
when
he
came
up
with
this
idea
is
not
the
state
as
an
owner,
but
the
state
as
a
regulatory
taxing
and
investment
maker,
the
provider
of
traffic
laws.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
what
we
would
say
of
course
there
was
a
good
deal
of
dispute,
as
you
recall,
before
the
congress
and
the
administrator
abandoned
the
parking
lots
as
an
indirect
source
and
told
the
administrator
not
to
regulate
that;
there
was
a
good
deal
of
constitutional
discussion,
and
it's
a
position
which
i
don't
believe
the
state
ever
took
a
position
on
it
and
we
don't
take
one
now.
but
there's
a
substantial
difference
between
what
the
administrator
could
do
to
that
owner
of
the
parking
lot
and
what
he's
prepared
to
do
vis-à-vis
the
states,
because
if
he
were
to
tell
the
owner
of
the
parking
lot
shut
down
your
parking
lot.
it
is
very
different
from
telling
the
state
i
want
you
to
exercise
your
police
powers
to
regulate
that
private
individual.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
the
question
is,
could
he
--
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
okay,
i
think
the
answer
would
be
that
indirect-source
regulation
may
be
permissible
in
some
circumstances.
the
question
was
identical
to
the
one
we
were
asking
before:
is
an
indirect-source
regulation
ever
permissible?
the
position
we've
taken
is
that
it
is;
but
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
the
parameters
are,
because
the
concept
of
indirect
source
we
view
as
a
drift
from
the
statutory
grounding,
but
in
fact
the
drift
has
gone
on
so
far
that
everything
is
an
indirect
source,
not
solely
a
parking
lot.
so
i
am
concerned
with
the
slippery
slope,
because
if
we
accede
to
the
concept
you
could
ever
regulate
an
indirect
source
and
the
administrator
has
made
everything
an
indirect
source,
then
the
conclusion
we're
logically
drawn
to
is
that
he
can
regulate
everything,
and
that's
a
position
which
the
state
vehemently
does
not
wish
to
take.
there
may
be
some
activities
where
the
nexus
of
ownership
is
so
close
to
the
pollution
that's
generated
that
one
could
really
say
that
the
owner
is
causing
the
pollution
in
some
meaningful
way.
but
we're
simply
saying
that
nexus
doesn't
exist
here;
that
the
state
is
not,
in
fact,
causing
this
pollution;
the
private
people
who
are
using
the
highways
are
causing
the
pollution;
and
furthermore,
that
even
if
the
highways
could
be
regarded
as
an
indirect
source
of
pollution,
that
this
object,
the
highway
as
the
indirect
source
of
pollution,
that
the
remedy
adopted.
namely,
telling
the
states
to
exercise
their
police
power
to
regulate
not
solely
access
to
the
highway.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
if
we
make
the
assumption
as
an
indirect
source,
yes,
we
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
the
difference
is
this.
we've
acceded,
as
you
know,
to
the
incinerator
example.
the
notion
that
the
state
owns
an
incinerator,
private
people
come,
they
put
their
refuse
in
there,
it
burns
up
and
violates
emissions
standards,
the
federal
government
could
say
to
the
state,
like
any
other
private
incinerator
owner.
you
cannot
let
an
excess
of
emissions
come
from
your
incinerator.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
frankly,
i
don't
know.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
perhaps
because
i'm
being
--
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
i
agree,
i
agree
and
all
i
can
say
is
that
i've
been
very
reluctant
to
concede
that,
because
i
don't
find
it
anywhere
in
the
statute.
but
i'm
not
troubled
about
conceding
it,
because
the
incinerator
example
is
so
much
different
from
our
example,
because
the
difference
is
in
the
remedy.
you
see,
if
the
administrator
were
to
say
i
want
you
to
attach
a
scrubber
to
your
incinerator
chimney.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
that
is
very
different
from
saying
i
--
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
very
different
from
saying
to
the
private
party
i
want
you
to
pre-treat
your
garbage
under
pain
of
civil
and
criminal
enforcement,
so
that
it
does
not
pollute
when
you
put
it
in
my
incinerator.
see,
it's
not
only
a
question
of
the
subject
of
the
regulation,
namely,
highways,
incinerators,
sewers,
whatever.
an
important
thing
to
keep
in
mind
is
not
solely
the
subject
of
the
regulation,
but
the
contents
of
the
regulation.what
is
it
that
was
being
asked
to
happen
here?
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
no.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
well,
as
i
said,
i
may
appear
to
be
waffling
around
the
subject.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
no,
i'm
not
taking
that
position
as
i
say,
i
may
appear
to
be
waffling,
and
i
don't
mean
to
be.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
--
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
the
difference
between
--
of
course,
the
bus
lanes,
of
course
you
don't
get
to
that
question
as
to
whether
the
bus
lanes
is
a
regulation
of
the
highways,
as
opposed
to
the
police-power
regulation
until
you
decide
that
the
highway
is
an
indirect
source.
so
once
you've
got
to
the
point
that
the
highway
is
an
indirect
source,
then
the
question
is,
is
the
bus
lane
the
regulation
of
the
highway,
or
is
the
bus
lane
the
regulation
of
people,
of
private
sources
of
emission?
that's
also
a
tougher
question
than
inspection
and
maintenance.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
okay,
the
answer
is,
i
--
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
okay,
the
answer
is
that
what
the
state
is
being
required
to
do
is
to
use
its
police
powers
to
keep
people
in
the
bus
lane
and
not
outside
of
it.
we
would
submit
that
that
is
not
permissible,
because
what
it
really
comes
down
to
is,
those
people
are
going
to
get
tickets;
the
state
is
forced
to
give
them
tickets
under
its
police
power
and
to
use
its
criminal
laws
to
enforce
particular
behavior
upon
its
citizens.
the
prime
example
of
the
regulation
of
a
highway
not
involving
the
regulation
of
citizens
under
the
police
power
--
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
no.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
that's
my
personal
view,
i
don't.
in
fact,
what
it's
meant
to
do
is
to
provide
a
--
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
well,
the
bus-lane
idea
is
not
so
much
that
they're
going
to
clean
up
the
air,
but
it
is
what
they
call
to
provide
a
disincentive
to
private
traffic.
we
had
the
experience
in
los
angeles,
you
may
have
read
about
it
the
diamond
lanes.
it
wasn't
so
much
that
the
smog
was
any
less;
the
smog
was
more,
because
the
remaining
lanes
were
so
clogged
with
people
idling
as
the
bus
lane
was
empty
that
there
was
more
smog.
the
strategy
behind
the
bus
lane
really
is
that
people
will
become
so
infuriated
at
the
traffic
congestion
that
they'll
take
buses.
so
i
am
not
sure
that
it's
a
good
idea
and,
in
fact,
certainly
not
in
los
angeles.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
if
something
were
available
to
the
states,
such
as
building
a
plastic
dome
over
the
freeway
and
somehow
not
letting
those
pollutants
into
the
air,
but
putting
it
somewhere
else
to
make
it
somehow
more
analogous
to
the
sewer
example,
then
perhaps
we
could
say
they
could
do
that.
but,
see,
the
prime
evil
here
is
not
so
much
the
subject
matter
of
the
regulation.
that's
why
we
haven't
been
very
hard
on
the
notion
abstractly
of
indirect
source,
that
somehow
a
highway
could
be
regulated.
the
prime
evil
here
and
the
one
that
i
wish
to
stress
and
leave
with
this
court
is
what
epa’s
contents
of
the
regulations
are,
the
notion
that
the
state
must
use
its
police
power
to
regulate
private
conduct
to
make
not
coming
in
for
an
inspection
a
violation.
to
make
not
after
the
inspection
and
after
50%
of
the
cars
which
are
mandated
to
fail
fail,
not
fixing
it
up
within
two
weeks
to
make
that
a
violation
of
the
state’s
criminal
law
and
so
on,
to
make
the
governor
of
the
state.
the
officers
of
the
state
liable
under
the
statute
to
criminal
and
civil
enforcement
if
they
do
not
propose
legislation
which
is
acceptable
to
the
administrator.
the
evil
is
the
usurpation
and
arrogation
of
the
state’s
police
power,
not
solely
making
highways
the
object
of
regulation.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
the
government
has
not
withdrawn
that.
what
they
have
said,
and
i
think
it's
very
plain
from
footnote
14
of
their
brief,
they
wish
now
to
reword
their
statutes
or
their
regulations.
rather
than
saying
to
a
state,
“state,
you
must
pass
a
law
that
says
x",
what
they
mean
now
to
do
is
say,
“state,
we
want
you
to
achieve
the
result
of
a
maintenance
and
inspection
program
somehow
happening”.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
our
answer
to
that
is
that
if
the
only
ways
that
are
available
are
to
exercise
our
police
power,
then
that
is
not
an
acceptable
solution.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
if
the
ways
that
are
available.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
yes;
but,
you
see,
any
private
polluter,
if
the
only
ways
that
are
available
--
this
is
why
i
use
the
astrodome
over
the
freeway
example.
if
the
only
ways
that
are
available
are
to
use
our
police
power
to
make
certain
conduct
criminal,
then
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
the
administrator
hasn't
gone
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
position.
the
administrator
rather
presents
this
court
with
a
notion
that
it
has
gone
to
change
the
very
regulations
which
are
at
issue
here,
and
this
deals
with
mr.
justice
powell’s
question
of
what's
left
in
this
case.
everything
is
left
in
this
case
upon
which
certiorari
was
granted,
because
the
administrator
not
only
has
not
told
this
court
i'm
going
to
withdraw
these
regulations,
the
case
is
moot.
he
hasn't
said
that.
he
says
i
am
going
to
give
you
these
exact
same
regulations
back,
but
the
difference
in
the
regulations
is
going
to
be
the
states
are
going
to
do
exactly
the
same
thing,
physically
they
are
going
to
do
the
same
things;
but
the
difference
is
that
we
are
going
to
phrase
it
slightly
differently.
rather
than
specifically
commanding
passage
of
a
state
law,
we
are
going
to
say
achieve
this
result,
knowing
it
requires
the
passage
of
a
state
law;
but
then
you
can
view
that
simply
as
an
indirect
unfortunate
circumstance.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
surely.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
indeed.
we
do
agree
they
have
that
kind
of
power.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
well,
the
short
answer
is,
yes,
we
agree;
but,
you
see,
the
question
is
not
physical
intrusion
into
the
state
or
having
state
people
on
our
freeways.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
well,
the
real
issue
is
whether
the
state’s
police
power
is
going
to
be
controllable
by
the
administrator,
and
that's
the
issue
in
this
case
and
we
submit
that's
the
question
before
this
court,
not
whether
highways
are
a
proper
subject
of
federal
regulation.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
indeed,
and
in
fact
many
of
the
examples
given
by
the
administrator
are
specific
constitutional
empowerment
of
the
federal
government
to
force
the
states
to
do
particular
kinds
of
things
under
the
war
powers
act
or
article
iii
and
various
other
examples;
but
no
such
powers
exist
under
the
commerce
clause
to
force
the
states
to
use
their
police
power
in
any
particular
manner,
and
that's
our
major
point
with
this
case.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
exactly,
our
basal
position
is
that
this
is
a
traditional
state
function.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
we
simply
suggest
that
if
you
read
the
statute,
you
don't
find
any
specific
authority,
and
the
presumption
is
that
traditional
state
functions
are
not
likely
to
be
found
to
be
usurped
or
regulated
by
the
federal
government
and
that
this
statute
does
not
present
that
specific
authority
and
that,
in
the
absence
of
that,
this
should
not
be
surmised,
it
should
not
be
read
into
the
statute.
the
presumption
should
be
that
traditional
state
authorities
are
to
be
maintained
unimpaired
by
federal
statutes
unless
congress
says
differently.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
indeed,
that's
the
next
one,
and
i
should
properly
cede
that
to
the
next.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
no,
it's
not
my
position.
perhaps
constitutionally
they
could;
but
mr.
lord
may
have
a
contrary
opinion.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
i
know.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
no,
the
short
answer
is
that
we're
not
complaining
so
much
at
the
subject
matter
of
regulation,
whether
it
be
parking
lots
or
highways
or
supermarkets
or
anything
of
that
nature.
now,
we
are
not
conceding
that
it's
in
the
statute,
and
i
don't
wish
to
be
any
more
indefinite
than
i
have
to
be;
i'm
simply
not
trying
to
commit
myself
on
issues
i
haven't
given
sufficient
thought
to.
but
the
question
is
not
the
subject
matter
of
regulation,
but
the
contents
of
regulation.
what
are
they
asking
the
states
to
do
and
in
this
case,
what
they're
asking
the
states
to
do
is
to
make
particular
private
conduct
criminal.
that's
the
evil
here
is
the
arrogation
of
state
power,
not
the
fact
that
they've
chosen
a
highway
as
the
subject
matter
of
regulation.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
indeed.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
but
everything's
an
indirect
source.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
but,
you
see,
the
private
operator
doesn't
have
the
police
power
available
to
him.
i
understand
that.
i
thought
you
said
a
while
ago
that
there's
no
authority
to
regulate
any
indirect
source.
that
was
the
one
that
i
appeared
to
be
waffling
on,
simply
because
i
haven't
explored
all
its
parameters,
because
once
one
suggests
any
indirect
source,
then
one
gets
into
the
administrator’s
regulation
where
everything
is
an
indirect
source
and
i'm
not
willing
to
concede
that
he
can
regulate
everything.
but
the
difference
between
a
private
highway
operator
doing
this
and
the
state
doing
this
is
that
the
private
highway
operator
can't
give
tickets.
he
can't
use
any
police
power,
any
criminal
sanctions,
to
force
people
to
stay
in
that
bus
lane.
i
suppose
he
can
say
don’t
you
come
back
here
anymore.
but
uniquely
the
state
is
the
one
that
has
to
keep
people
in
the
bus
lanes,
and
the
way
they
do
it
is
through
enforcing
the
system
of
traffic
laws.
when
the
administrator
tells
the
state
we
demand
you
use
your
police
power
to
,“enforce
our
regulation”,
to
make
that
private
conduct
criminal
under
state
law,
that's
the
evil
we're
addressing
here
and
that's
what
we're
suggesting
is
nowhere
to
be
found
anywhere
within
the
four
corners
of
the
clean
air
act.
mr.
joel
s.
moskowitz
thank
you.
