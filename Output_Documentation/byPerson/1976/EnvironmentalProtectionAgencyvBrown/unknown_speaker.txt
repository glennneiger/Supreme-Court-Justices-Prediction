unknown
speaker
well,
your
argument
doesn't
quite
go
that
far,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
don’t
they
concede
that
a
state
can
be
in
violation
insofar
as
municipally
owned
incinerators
or...
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
and
they
concede
that
to
be
true,
do
they
not?
unknown
speaker
therefore,
they
do
not
make
the
broad
argument
that
you
just
paraphrased.
unknown
speaker
the
source
of
the
pollution
isn’t
really
the
highway,
is
it?
it
is
the
automobile.
unknown
speaker
on
your
theory,
the
ownership
or
the
control
as
it
exists
in
some
places
of
the
airports
and
of
other
sector
facilities
would
open
up
the
same.
unknown
speaker
specifically
operated
sewers
in
which
the
private
sector
puts
effluents.
unknown
speaker
but
the
sanction
there
wasn't
at
all
clear.
i
suspect
that
the
view
might
be
quite
different
in
a
court
if
the
federal
government
said
if
you
don't
provide
this
corps
of
inspectors,
we're
going
to
deny
you
federal
funds
or
federal
grants,
it
might
be
quite
different
if
you
said
we're
going
to
put
the
head
of
the
motor
vehicle
division
in
jail.
but
your
statute
provides
here
that
this
kind
of
issue
can't
be
raised
in
the
enforcement
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
the
question
here
is
the
power
of
the
administrator
to
tell
the
state
to
close
the
highway.
unknown
speaker
that's
where
we
are
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
and
the
administrator
can
step
in
and
say
we're
not
going
to
have
this
state
doing
that,
we're
going
to
enforce
these
prohibitions
against
them.
unknown
speaker
so
the
question
here
is
whether
the
administrator
is
going
to
do
it
through
federal
agents
or
whether
the
administrator
can
force
the
states
to
do
it
through
their
agent.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course
governor
sergeant,
i
take
it,
was
not
the
author
of
the
legislative
history,
or
did
he
vote
on
the
clean
air
act.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
have
to
find
some
authority
in
the
statute,
as
justice
stevens
suggests,
to
authorize
what
you're
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
51-a
of
your
petition,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
it's
equivalent
to
52-23?
unknown
speaker
the
bus
purchase
is
entirely
out
of
the
case
now.
unknown
speaker
are
the
bike
lanes
still
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
randolph,
it's
evident
that
there
has
been
a
good
deal
of
shrinkage
in
this
case
since
the
original
litigation
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
i
am
very
interested
in
the
answer
to
the
specific
detail
of
the
concrete
answer
to
mr.
justice
powell’s
question,
which
perhaps
can't
be
done
orally
in
a
short
time;
but
i'm
interested
in
knowing
just
what's
left
in
this
case
and
a
memorandum
would
be
very
helpful
to
me.
unknown
speaker
if
you
and
counsel
could
agree
on
it.
unknown
speaker
inspection,
maintenance
and
bus
lanes.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
it.
unknown
speaker
and
would
your
memorandum
include
the
regulations
that
still
remain
intact
that
we
will
have
to
review?
unknown
speaker
so
the
retrofit
issue
is
all
gone,
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
from
what
the
brief
says,
it
is
very
difficult
to
ascertain
what
of
the
core
remains.
unknown
speaker
congress
did
something
about
parking
surcharge
regulations,
too,
in
those
amendments,
didn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
were
they
asked
to
change
those
regulations?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
enforcement
as
between
the
federal
and
the
state
governments?
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
the
consequence
of
a
state’s
failure
to
comply
with
that
provision
in
the
highway
act?
unknown
speaker
am
i
right
in
this,
in
my
concept
and
understanding
of
what
a
typical
indirect
source
would
be?
it
would
be
a
repair
garage
whose
business
is
repairing
carburetors,
and
private
people
take
their
automobiles
in
there,
maybe
100
automobiles
a
day
are
in
there
with
the
motors
running
and
they're
adjusting
the
carburetors
and
the
gasoline
fumes,
the
various
effluents
from
carburetors
arise
from
this
repair
shop.
the
repair
shop
would
be
an
indirect
source,
would
it
not
be?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
our
definition?
unknown
speaker
these
would
be
cars
privately
owned
by
individual
owners
who
brought
them
in
there
to
be
repaired,
and
the
cars
would
be
there
as
permitees
or
licensees
on
the
premises.
unknown
speaker
and
the
papers
here
anywhere?
unknown
speaker
would
you
repeat
the
citation,
please,
i
didn't
get
it.
unknown
speaker
now,
where
in
the
statute
do
you
get
the
administrator’s
power
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question.
what
if
the
administrator
just
said
no
more
than
x
amount
of
emissions
per
linear
foot
of
expressway,
and
achieve
it
any
way
you
want
to?
unknown
speaker
you
think
that
is
equally
beyond
his
authority
under
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
federal
officials
have
intruded
into
the
states
since
the
time
of
the
whiskey
rebellion.
unknown
speaker
i
think
your
position
is
that
under
this
particular
statute,
the
federal
government
has
no
authority
to
cause
to
be
created
or
to
force
to
be
created
a
bus
lane.
unknown
speaker
although
there's
only
one
person
against
which
it
could
operate
to
create
a
bus
lane,
and
that
would
be
the
state.
unknown
speaker
then
is
your
position
also
that
under
the
constitution,
the
federal
government
has
no
power
to
cause
the
creation
of
a
bus
lane?
unknown
speaker
but
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
but
the
privately
owned
highway
is
still
indirect
source.
unknown
speaker
well,
because
i
thought
you
just
answered.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you
just
answered
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that,
yes,
that
would
be
all
right
with
you
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
how
many
states
do
not
have
safety?
unknown
speaker
arizona
has
done
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lord,
i
am
late
in
asking
you
this
question;
but
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
it,
even
though
belatedly.
your
argument
is
proceeding
upon
the
premise,
upon
the
hypothesis
that
the
statute
does
authorize
what
the
administrator
has
purported
to
do
and
you're
saying
that
it
is
unconstitutional?
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
but
this
is
a
question
really
not
addressed
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
they
construed
the
statute
because
of
grave
constitutional
doubts
about
any
other
construction.
am
i
correct?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
i
had.
unknown
speaker
but
now
your
argument
is
assuming
that
contrary
to
the
courts
of
appeals
that
the
statute
does
permit
what
the
administrator
did
do
here.
unknown
speaker
could
the
federal
government
say
no
car
on
the
highway
without
a
federal
sticker?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
the
federal
government
under
your
view
would
have
to
have
its
own
inspection
system.
unknown
speaker
would
that
not
sticker
on
the
federal
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
the
federal
government
would
give
it
tags
or
not.
if
you
gave
it
a
tag,
they'd
have
to
take
it
off
the
street;
if
you
didn't
give
it
a
tag,
they'd
have
to
take
it
off
the
street.
unknown
speaker
so
the
state
police
could
pick
the
guy
up,
whereas
in
the
other
system
perhaps
you'd
have
to
wait
for
the
federals.
unknown
speaker
now,
of
course
they
can
be
reached;
i
think
everybody
here
in
the
audience
agrees
with
that,
but
how
can
they
be
reached?
can
the
administrator
tell
the
state
you
have
to
adopt
regulations
governing
your
vehicles?
unknown
speaker
alright,
so
the
administrator
can
tell
the
state
you
must
regulate
this,
even
though
it
might
involve
the
exercise
of
the
police
powers.
unknown
speaker
whatever
it
takes
to
do,
you
must
do
it
and
how
is
that
different
from
the
case
before
us?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
we're
talking
constitutionally;
that's
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
yes,
it
is,
it's
told
to
regulate
the
drivers
and
the
repairmen
of
those
cars.
unknown
speaker
how
constitutionally
is
that
different
from
saying
the
state
must
take
steps
to
bring
its
own
roads
into
compliance?
unknown
speaker
well,
those
vehicles
could
be
reached
under
the
same
theory
as
my
colloquy
with
justice
stewart.
unknown
speaker
this
is
on
the
premise,
i
take
it,
that
the
so-called
mere
enforcement
requirement
of
federal
regulations
would
necessarily
involve
the
police
power.
unknown
speaker
or
having
that
power.
unknown
speaker
well,
listen,
the
proprietary
power,
if
looked
at
one
way
at
least,
is
not
unlike
the
power
of
the
owner
of
a
private
turnpike
would
have
to
limit
the
traffic
density
on
his
turnpike
at
the
behest
of
the
administrator
and
the
administrator
concededly,
as
we've
heard
both
under
the
statute
and
under
the
constitution,
would
have
the
power
to
regulate
the
owner
of
a
private
turnpike
and
say
no
more
than
so
many
vehicles
a
minute
on
the
turnpike;
and
why
couldn’t
the
same
thing
be
said
to
the
state,
because
the
private
operator
doesn't
have
any
police
power;
he
just
has
the
proprietary
power
that
comes
from
owning
the
turnpike?
unknown
speaker
that's
right,
or
limit
access
to
it.
