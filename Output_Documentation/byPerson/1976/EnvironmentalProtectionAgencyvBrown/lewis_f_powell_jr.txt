f.
powell,

just
to
take
the
other
extreme,
let's
assume
that
the
administrator
concluded
that
dispensal
of
highways
was
really
the
answer
to
the
pollution
problem
and
ordered,
say,
the
state
of
virginia
and
the
state
of
maryland,
despite
their
proximity
to
washington,
to
build
a
billion
dollars'
worth
of
new
highways.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what's
the
difference
between
saying
you
shall
have
carpool
lanes?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
instead
of
building
distinctly
different
highways,
the
answer
was
suggested
that
you
widen
the
highways
you
now
have
to
include
carpool
lanes?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
if,
for
example,
every
incinerator
in
a
state
were
deemed
to
be
so
inadequate
that
it
had
to
be
replaced,
would
that
be
constructing
new
property?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
is
required
of
private
industry,
as
you
say.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but,
mr.
randolph,
isn’t
there
a
rather
plain
distinction
between
operating
a
sewage
system
which
deposits
effluent
into
the
water
or
the
air,
as
opposed
to
operating
a
highway
which
deposits
nothing?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
is
your
best
precedent
for
saying
a
highway
is
itself
a
source
of
pollution?
it
is
indirectly,
but
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
it
the
sewage
system?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
we
are
not
talking
about
common-law
nuisance;
we
are
talking
about
statutory
authority
to
compel
a
state
to
establish
a
program
affirmatively.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it's
not
like
the
sewage
system,
i
don't
think.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
sure
you
are.
you're
saying
the
owner
of
the
source
of
the
pollution.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that's
the
highway,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
correct.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
sit
down?
what
specific
regulations
are
left
in
this
case
as
of
today?
can
you
identify
those?
in
other
words,
what
are
we
addressing?
what
is
left
as
compared
with
what
was
before
the
courts
of
appeals?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
was
the
inspection
and
maintenance
section?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
that's
both
arizona
and
california?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
what
are
the
sanctions
against
the
governmental
entity?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
any
other?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
a
citizen’s
suit,
it's
an
injunction.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
randolph,
let
me
be
sure
i
understand
this
point.
i
thought
the
underlying
regulation
that
your
question
presented
in
your
cert
petition
to
the
ninth
circuit
judgment
attack
was
the
one
that
imposed
a
duty
on
the
governmental
agency
to
establish
and
maintain
an
inspection
program.
so
isn’t
that
what's
really
at
issue?well,
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
oh,
i'm
sorry.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
still
an
issue
here.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
what's
going
to
happen
to
the
provisions
that
are
(f)
on
page
3a?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this,
what
we're
looking
at
here,
has
now
been
withdrawn,
has
it?
