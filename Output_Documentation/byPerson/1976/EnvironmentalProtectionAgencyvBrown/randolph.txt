mr.
randolph
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth,
ninth
and
district
of
columbia
circuits.
at
issue
are
the
clean
air
act
amendments
of
1970
and
regulations
promulgated
by
epa
requiring
respondents
to
take
certain
actions
to
control
motor-vehicle
air
pollution.
two
of
the
courts
below,
the
ninth
and
fourth
circuits,
decided
the
case
on
statutory
grounds,
holding
epa’s
regulations
invalid
insofar
as
they
required
states
to
comply
with
them.
district
of
columbia
circuit’s
decision
is
more
difficult
to
summarize.
basically,
it
agreed
with
the
epa
that
the
state
as
owner
of
a
pollution
source
--
the
highways
--
could
be
required
under
the
act
to
reduce
pollution,
the
state,
the
court
held,
could
be
required
to
refuse
registration
to
vehicles
exceeding
federal
pollution
standards;
but
inspection
must
be
done
by
the
federal
government.
we
petitioned
in
all
three
cases,
raising
the
issue
whether
inspection
and
maintenance
could
be
required.
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
cross-petitioned
in
the
district
of
columbia
case,
raising
the
issue
of
bus
lanes
and
purchases.
in
a
decision
not
being
reviewed
here,
the
third
circuit
sustained
epa’s
transportation-control
regulations
against
both
a
statutory
and
a
constitutional
challenge.
before
i
describe
the
act
and
the
regulations
and
focus
the
issues
somewhat,
i'd
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
more
about
what
particular
subject
is
involved
here,
which
is
air
pollution,
a
topic
that
this
court
referred
to
in
washington
versus
general
motors
as
one
of
the
most
notorious
types
of
public
nuisance
in
modern
experience.
the
chief
culprit,
or
one
of
the
chief
culprits,
is
the
automobile,
spewing
vast
amounts
of
assorted
poisons
into
the
air
and
accounting
for
by
weight,
by
tonnage,
nearly
half
of
all
air
pollution
in
the
country.
because
of
incomplete
combustion
and
evaporation,
the
internal
combustion
engine
produces
carbon
monoxide
and
unburned
hydrocarbons.
because
of
high
temperatures,
it
oxidizes
nitrogen
in
the
air.
in
the
presence
of
sunlight,
several
of
these
pollutants
react
in
complex
ways,
producing
photochemical
oxidants,
or
what
is
commonly
called
smog.
the
result
is
thousands
of
deaths
yearly,
millions
of
days
of
illness
and
billions
of
dollars
in
health
costs
and
property
damage
throughout
the
united
states.
one
more
fact,
and
i
think
this
is
very
important
to
our
case,
air
pollution
travels,
it
moves.
it
does
not
respect
state
boundaries,
it
does
not
stay
located
in
one
place.
the
court
may
have
seen
an
article
--
i
don't
know
the
truth
of
it,
but
it
illustrates
my
point
--
in
last
month’s
new
york
times
where
it
was
reported
that
the
vineyards
in
western
new
york
were
being
destroyed
by
air
pollution
from
automobiles
in
gary,
indiana.
i
think
that's
as
vivid
an
illustration
as
possible;
whether
it
is
true
or
not,
i
don't
know.
one
other
fact,
in
section
101
of
the
act
that
is
in
issue
here,
congress
found
that
the
predominant
part
of
the
nation’s
population
--
this
is
the
very
first
finding
in
the
act
--
is
located
in
the
rapidly
expanding
metropolitan
areas
of
the
country,
which
generally
cross
state
borders
or
are
very
near
state
borders.
now,
i
don't
think
i
exaggerate,
before
i
talk
about
the
act,
to
say
that
when
congress
legislated
in
the
clean
air
act,
it
was
doing
so
and
acting
for
many
of
the
very
reasons
that
the
founders
met
in
philadelphia
in
1877
and
established
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
let
me
be
explicit.
one
of
the
framers’
main
objectives
was
to
create
a
national
system
of
government
whereby
one
state
could
not
pursue
its
own
selfish
interests
to
the
injury
and
detriment
of
its
sister
states
and
the
citizens
of
its
sister
states.
i
think
you
all
recall
one
of
the
most
famous
statements
about
why
the
constitution
met
was
made
by
madison.
he
likened
new
jersey,
sitting
between
philadelphia
and
new
york,
as
a
keg
tapped
at
both
ends;
or
north
carolina,
sitting
between
south
carolina
and
virginia,
as
a
patient
bleeding
from
both
arms.
my
point
is
that
in
arguing
here
against
national
action,
because
of
compulsion
on
the
states,
the
respondents
have
to
confront
the
commerce
clause
at
its
very
core.
the
air
is
a
national
resource;
air
pollution
travels
and
as
i
hope
to
demonstrate
in
this
argument,
it
is
no
part
of
our
federalism
that
the
health,
the
welfare
and
the
property
of
the
citizens
of
one
state
have
to
suffer
because
surrounding
states
refuse
to
take
action
to
combat
air
pollution
stemming
from
the
use
of
their
highways.
now,
in
the
clean
air
act
amendments
of
1970,
congress
recognized
that
control
of
air
pollution
was
the
primary
responsibility
of
the
states.
but
strong
national
action
was
demanded.
previous
efforts,
federal
efforts,
to
combat
the
mounting
crisis
had
failed.
the
history
as
recounted
in
the
court’s
opinion
in
train
versus
nrdc,
suffice
it
to
say
here
that
despite
offers
of
technical
and
financial
assistance
to
the
states,
the
states
had
made
little
progress
in
meeting
their
responsibility.
the
1970
amendments,
if
i
can
describe
them
quickly
--
the
court
had
two
cases
last
term
dealing
with
the
clean
air
act,
and
i
will
be
rather
brief
in
the
description
--
in
the
1970
amendments,
the
epa
administrator
was
required
to
set
air-quality
standards
at
a
level
that
protects
against
the
adverse
effects
on
health
and
welfare.
section
110
of
the
act
sets
forth
the
process
for
establishing
state
programs
to
achieve
and
maintain
these
air-quality
standards.
now,
exactly
how
air
pollution
was
to
be
controlled
within
a
state
was
left
initially
to
the
state
itself.
the
state
was
to
submit
a
plan
to
epa,
which
epa
was
required
to
accept
if
the
plan
met
the
broad
outline
set
forth
in
section
110
of
the
act.
two
of
those
requirements
set
forth
in
110
are
that
the
state
plan
contained,
where
necessary,
transportation
controls
and
an
inspection
and
maintenance
program.
if
the
state
plan
was
deficient,
epa
would
issue
a
substitute,
at
least
for
those
parts
of
the
state
plan
that
were
deficient.
although
the
state
plans
were
due
by
january
of
1972,
epa
gave
an
extension
to
all
the
states
where
transportation
controls
would
be
required
to
meet
ambient
air-quality
standards.
it
did
this
because
epa
realized,
just
like
everyone
else
did,
that
we
had
very
little
experience
with
transportation
controls.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
was
why
we
had
a
problem;
however,
a
federal
court
of
appeals
sitting
at
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
held
that
the
act
did
not
permit
this
delay
and
ordered
that
the
extension
of
time
be
rescinded,
and
epa
complied.
by
late
1973,
the
process
of
formulating
state
plans
had
been
completed.
some
of
epa’s
final
regulations,
which
in
many
instances,
i
might
add,
reflected
state
choices
--
and
by
that,
i
mean
reflected
the
choices
of
the
states
when
they
submitted
proposals
or
proposed
plans.
imposed
duties
on
the
states
with
respect
to
state-owned
highways
and
required
the
establishment
of
an
emission
inspection
and
maintenance
program
for
vehicles
registered
by
the
state.
now,
respondents'
statutory
argument
in
this
case
is
that
the
1970
amendments
do
not
allow
compulsion
on
a
state
to
act
to
reduce
motor-vehicle
air
pollution;
in
other
words,
to
put
it
bluntly,
a
state
can
never
be
in
violation
of
an
implementation
plan
designed
to
meet
air-quality
standards.
mr.
randolph
i
think
that's
the
problem
with
it.
mr.
randolph
that
was
the
point
i
was
about
to
make.
mr.
randolph
so
if
that
is
true,
and
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
states.
mr.
randolph
they
concede
that.
mr.
randolph
i
think
that
is
the
problem
with
their
argument.
a
state
can
be
a
violator,
and
i
would
say
the
respondents
admit
it
can.
the
question
then
is
whether
a
state,
by
owning
the
highways,
can
be
a
source
of
pollution,
an
owner
of
a
source
of
pollution
which
has
to
comply,
like
anyone
else,
with
the
clean
air
act’s
requirements.
certainly
if
the
state
owns
a
municipal
incinerator,
it
is
clear
it
is
a
source
of
pollution,
and
it
has
to
comply.
i
think
that
is
their
position,
and
the
epa’s
position,
i
think,
is
clearly
set
out
in
our
brief
and
i
think
it
is
fundamental
to
our
argument.
the
epa
administrator
determined
early
on
before
any
constitutional
issue
was
raised
--
this
was
purely
a
matter
dealing
with
statute,
dealing
with
legislative
histories,
the
judgment
by
administrator,
and
i
don't
think
it
is
open
to
reasonable
doubt
--
that
the
states,
by
owning
the
highways,
own
a
pollution
source
and
can
be
required
to
take
action,
just
like
a
private
source
owner
can.
mr.
randolph
i
was
getting
into
it,
and
i
will
explain.
mr.
randolph
well,
i
agree
that
without
automobiles,
we
would
not
have
air
pollution.
without
people
driving
the
automobiles
about,
we
would
not
have
air
pollution.without
a
highway,
we
would
not
have
air
pollution.
mr.
randolph
yes,
any
facility
as
--
mr.
randolph
any
source,
--
my
theory
is
as
long
--
mr.
randolph
yes.
mr.
randolph
that
is
right.
without
manufacturers
of
automobiles,
we
would
not
have
air
pollution.
i
do
not
know
whether
this
is
properly
characterized
as
a
pass-the-buck
case,
but
where
does
the
buck
stop?
does
it
stop
with
the
automobile
manufacturers?
i
think
congress
said,
yes,
it
does;
it
stops
right
there
and
we
are
going
to
regulate
them
and
require
them
to
manufacture
cars
in
a
certain
way.
they
are
being
required
to
do
that.
does
it
stop
with
the
citizen
who's
driving
the
car
about?
well,
of
course
it
does;
it
stops
with
the
citizen.
who
is
going
to
pay
for
all
these
in
the
end?
the
citizen
is
going
to
have
to
pay.
does
it
stop
with
the
federal
government?
yes,
it
stops
with
the
federal
government.
the
clean
air
act
imposes,
i
think
as
the
court
said
in
train,
an
incredibly
difficult
problem
of
regulation
on
the
federal
government
and
money
to
be
spent
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
does
it
stop
with
the
states?
the
states
say
no,
or
at
least
these
four
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
say
no,
that
the
federal
government
should
do
it
all.
well,
we
don't
think
that
is
the
right
construction
of
the
act,
and
we
don't
think
that
the
constitution
requires
that
result.
we
think
it
is
quite
a
simple
proposition
that
is
involved
here
as
far
as
the
epa’s
determination.
is
it
unreasonable,
as
the
administrator
found,
that
when
a
property
owner
invites
others
to
engage
in
certain
activities
on
his
property,
the
owner
can
be
held
responsible
for
the
harm
caused
by
those
activities?
that
is
the
epa
administrator’s
decision.
the
property
owner
in
this
case
happens
to
be
the
state.
the
property
is
the
highway.
the
persons
using
them,
the
invitees
or
licensees,
are
the
citizens.
further,
and
as
mr.
justice
stewart
said,
we
believe
the
highways
are
quite
analogous
to
the
sewer
systems.
in
both
instances,
the
polluting
matter
comes
not
from
the
state,
it
comes
from
the
private
citizens;
yet
a
state
system
of
sewage
disposal
is
subject
to
federal
regulation
under
the
commerce
clause.
the
court
so
held
in
the
sanitary
district
case.
mr.
randolph
yes,
well,
i
don't
know
if
i
will
accept
that
construction
of
the
act.
it
is
not
the
administrator
forcing
the
states
to
enforce
his
plan.
what
it
is
is
forcing
the
states
to
comply
with
his
plan,
not
enforce
it.
mr.
randolph
well,
that
is
the
choice,
i
suppose,
yes,
it
may
be
something
different
than
that.
it
may
be
requiring
the
state
to
do
this
or
not
having
it
done
at
all,
depending
on
what
the
practical
difficulties
are
of
having,
for
example,
a
federal
highway
patrol
on
the
nation’s
highways
to
enforce
this.
mr.
randolph
well,
i
think
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
briefs
that
the
draft
--
i
think
this
is
far
afield
now;
but
we
used
it
for
another
point
--
the
draft
in
world
war
ii
was
done
by
requiring
state
officials
to
register
the
people.
i
do
not
think
the
question
here
really
is
which
is
the
best
system,
having
federal
highway
patrols
for
the
first
time
in
the
country’s
history,
having
federal
inspection
and
maintenance.
the
question
is
whether
states
have
a
responsibility
here
to
do
this
by
themselves.
mr.
randolph
that
is
one
question.
mr.
randolph
the
first
question
in
the
case,
i
agree.
now,
the
only
response,
develop
what
the
epa
administrator
determined.
we
set
forth
in
our
brief
the
legislative
history;
we
set
forth
in
our
brief
the
various
statements
that
were
made
on
the
floor
of
congress.
the
only
response,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say,
that
respondents
make
is
that
they
seek
to
answer
our
argument
by
misstating
it.
they
argue
that
congress
could
never
have
intended
this,
because
epa’s
position
knows
no
rational
bounds.
one
might
as
well
say
that
pollution
from
a
factory
results
from
state
action
through,
for
example,
zoning
decisions.
i
think
that
is
the
example
they
give
at,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
page
44
of
their
brief.
but
that
ignores
the
fact
that
the
factory,
unlike
the
highway,
sits
on
private
land
and
if
there
is
one
thread
running
through
the
entire
clean
air
act,
it
is
that
the
owner
of
a
source
of
pollution
is
responsible,
can
be
made
responsible
for
controlling
the
pollution.
mr.
randolph
well,
i
don't
think
that's
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
highways
of
the
country
are
resting
on
easements.
i
think
the
highway
is
taken
by
eminent
domain.
mr.
randolph
well,
that
may
be;
but
the
fact
is
that
the
states
are
the
ones
that
have
that
highway.
states,
like
a
private
owner,
are
the
ones
that
are
allowing
people
to
come
on
it
and
use
it
for
a
certain
purpose,
and
as
a
result
of
that
pollution
is
generated.
it
would
be
no
different,
for
example,
if
the
state
owned
a
facility,
a
municipal
incinerator,
i
suppose;
but
the
state
never
operated
it
and
invited
a
private
contractor
to
come
on
and
run
the
municipal
incinerator.
we
think
that
the
state
in
that
situation
could
be
regulated
and
required
to
control
that
private
contractor,
just
like
if
the
private
contractor
had
been
operating
on
his
own
property
with
his
own
factory
spewing
pollution
into
the
air.
now,
they
make
another
point
in
this
regard
with
which
we
agree.
they
say
the
states
are
forced
to
comply
with
federal
law,
because
they
have
not
exercised
their
police
power.
i
think
that's
accurate.
but
all
that
means
is
that
we
would
not
have
federal
legislation
under
the
clean
air
act
if
the
states
had
controlled
air
pollution,
it
can't
mean
anything
more
than
that
because,
to
use
the
example
we've
been
talking
about,
if
the
state
incinerator
is
poisoning
the
atmosphere,
it
is
because
the
state
has
not
exercised
its
police
power
in
a
way
that
congress
wanted
the
state
to
do
it.
yet
respondents
admit
that
such
facilities
must
comply
with
federal
pollution
standards,
air-pollution
standards.
now,
this
brings
me
to
the
point,
i
think,
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
probably
should
mention
one
thing
which
is
not
mentioned
in
our
brief
as
far
as
the
statutory
point
is
concerned,
and
i
informed
respondents’
counsel
of
the
fact
that
i
may
mention
this.
i
think
the
appearance
and
the
impression
the
court
may
have
is
this
whole
idea
of
requiring
states
to
comply
under
penalty
of
federal
law
is
something
that
was
never
talked
about
very
much
during
the
hearings.
that's
not
accurate.
the
reason
we
don't
find
great
debates
about
that
--
and
i
would
like
to
remind
the
court,
the
clean
air
act
passed
the
senate
73
to
nothing;
it
passed
the
house
i
think
347
to
1
--
the
reason
one
doesn't
find
great
debates
about
that,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say,
is
if
the
court
examines
the
hearings,
the
legislative
history,
what
you'll
find
is
that
they're
filled
with
statements
from
cities,
from
states,
from
governors,
saying,
“we
need
this
legislation,
we
need
tough
legislation,
we
need
demanding
legislation,
we
need
to
be
required
to
do
these
things”.
the
fact
is,
there
wasn't
very
much
opposition.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
only
opposition
i
found
from
a
state
representative
--
and
i
have
to
give
california
credit
for
consistency
--
is
the
statement
of
governor
reagan
on
page
1300
of
the
senate
hearings,
where
he
objected
to,
as
he
put
it,
reserving
for
state
and
local
governments
the
task
and
cost
of
implementing
decisions
of
the
federal
government
under
threat
of
fines
and
punishment
if
the
job
is
not
done
to
the
satisfaction
of
then-secretary
of
hew,
but
now
epa
administrator.
governor
reagan,
i
might
add,
added
later
on
in
his
testimony
that,
“yes,
i
do
think,
however,
that
interstate
air-pollution
regions
would
benefit
from
federal
overview
to
resolve
disputes
and
to
prevent
inaction
in
one
state
imposing
pollution
problems
on
the
people
of
a
neighboring
state”.
that
is
at
page
1301
of
his
testimony.
we
have
17
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
in
which
pollution
transportation
controls
have
been
required.
i've
counted
up
the
cities
which
are
either
right
on
the
border
of
a
state
or
within
100
miles
of
the
border
of
another
state,
and
the
number
i
get
is
somewhere
between
75%
and
85%
of
all
the
cities
where
the
controls
we
are
talking
about
here
required
are
of
that
category,
either
right
on
the
border
of
a
state
or
at
least
within
100
miles
of
another
state.
now,
i
don't
want
to
give
the
impression
that
governor
reagan
was
the
only
governor
to
talk
against
this.
i
might
add
this,
douglas
m.
head
--
and
this
again
is
not
cited
in
our
brief
--
who
is
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
minnesota,
testified
on
behalf
of
the
national
associations
of
attorneys
general
and
stated
at
page
1183
of
the
senate
hearings
that,
“if
a
state
like
my
own
state
of
minnesota,
has
not
adopted
the
motor-vehicle
inspection
law",
and
they
still
have
not,
"we
would
still"
--
he
was
saying
what
kind
of
legislation
he
wanted
--
“be
pretty
much
compelled
to
install
an
inspection
program
for
emission-control
devices”.
and
without
dragging
this
out
too
much
further,
the
national
governors
conference,
represented
by
governor
sergeant
of
massachusetts
from
page
449
of
the
senate
hearings
to
page
453,
testified
in
favor
of
the
legislation;
and
i
think
governor
sergeant
on
behalf
of
the
national
governors
conference
said
at
the
end
of
his
testimony,
“i
think
the
states
can't
just
shrug
their
shoulders
and
say,
well,
let
the
federal
government
do
it”.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
that
is
the
position
of
the
respondents
in
this
case.
as
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned,
i
think
we
rest
on
solid
grounds
and
in
fact,
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
they
were
construing
the
statute
only
because
of
constitutional
doubts
that
they
had.
well,
let
me
address
those
constitutional
doubts.
mr.
randolph
well,
there's
been
a
lot
of
confusion
about
that,
and
i
think
maybe
i
can
clear
it
up.
first
of
all,
the
administrator’s
position
in
this
case
before
all
the
courts
of
appeals
has
not
been
we
can
force
states
to
enact
laws.
mr.
randolph
we
will
not
get
anyplace
arguing
about
that.
mr.
randolph
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
it
is
a
silly
decision
if
we
took
it.
i
mean,
we
all
know
tenney
v.
brandhove
gives
legislators
immunity
from
failing
to
--
like
speech
and
debate
clause.
mr.
randolph
but
the
problem
here
is
that
what
has
happened
is
that
regulations
that
--
the
epa
administrator,
in
imposing
these
controls,
walked
in
on
cat
feet.
he
didn't
charge
in
like
a
buffalo
trying
to
knock
the
states
down,
which
is
the
impression
i
think
that
one
gets
maybe
from
reading
the
briefs
in
this
case,
and
we
are
as
responsible
for
that
as
anyone
else.
what
he
did
is,
first
of
all,
he
tried
to
give
them
extension
of
time,
which
he
then
was
cut
back
by
a
court
and
told
that,
no,
you
can't
give
an
extension
and
then
when
he
was
forced
to
impose
controls,
he
tried
to
give
the
states
as
much
leeway
as
possible.
i
mean,
he
could
have
gone
and
put
in
his
regulations
details
down
to
that
far
and
said
you
do
it
this
way
and
that
is
precisely
the
way
you
have
to
do
it.
instead,
he
tried
to
be
moderate,
he
tried,
in
imposing
something
on
the
state,
tried
to
give
the
state
leeway.
the
states
had
come
to
him
and
said,
look,
we
are
going
to
get
legislation
to
do
x
or,
you
know,
we
are
going
to
have
this
passed
in
the
house.
the
epa
administrator
said,
"okay,
fine,
when
you
get
the
legislation,
please
submit
it
to
me."
"please"
wasn't
there,
i
admit.
"submit
it
to
me,
and
then
you
will
be
in
compliance"
it
is
the
same
with
regulations.
we
have
accepted
the
d.c.
circuit’s
opinion
that
says
that
the
epa
administrator,
in
promulgating
a
substitute
plan
for
a
state,
cannot
in
that
plan
say
the
state
shall
submit
regulations
doing
x.
instead,
the
epa
has
to
put
down
in
as
much
detail
as
required
what
exactly
has
to
be
done.
that's
the
history
behind
that,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
i
think
that
the
impression
that
has
been
given
is
probably,
unless
i've
dispelled
it,
not
an
accurate
one
and
not
one
representative
of
the
epa.
mr.
randolph
he
can
say
to
the
state
that
the
municipal
incinerator
shall
emit
no
more
than
x
amount
of
whatever
it
is
emitting.
mr.
randolph
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
he
has
gone
far
less
than
that,
because
what
he's
done
here
is
try
to
give
the
state
a
lot
of
leeway.
these
regulations
are
going
to
have
to
be
re-promulgated.
we
were
put
in
the
position
on
the
one
hand
of
being
told
that
under
the
law
we
couldn't
promulgate
any
regulations
requiring
a
state
to
do
something;
and
then
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
the
case
was
remanded,
you
remember,
to
the
administrator.
but
what
he
has
done
in
this
case,
what
he
tried
to
do
--
and
d.c.
circuit,
of
course,
said
you
can't
do
that
--
is
say
to
the
states,
well,
look,
you
fill
in
the
details.
he
doesn't
say
exactly
how
much
pollution
we
are
going
to
allow
on
the
highways.
he
said
you
set
the
regulations,
you
set
a
certain
failure
rate
for
the
automobiles
being
inspected
and
set
up
the
program
and
so
forth.
mr.
randolph
well,
i
think
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
something
very
analogous
to
a
court
exercising
its
equity
power,
i
don't
claim
the
administrator
of
epa
has
any
such
authority;
but
if
you
recall
when
you're
issuing
injunctive
orders
requiring
certain
things
to
be
done,
the
first
one
sometimes
is
very
broad,
the
next
one
gets
a
little
narrower,
and
the
next
one
gets
a
little
narrower
and
narrower
and
narrower.
i
don't
think
that
that
difference
makes
a
difference
under
the
statute.
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
statute
that
makes
that
in
any
way
different.
i
think
the
administrator
perhaps
could
say
that
in
order
to
control
pollution,
a
scrubber
shall
be
installed
on
that.
mr.
randolph
oh,
yeah.
mr.
randolph
he
can
do
anything
with
a
government-operated
incinerator
that
he
could
do
with
a
private
incinerator.
mr.
randolph
i
don't
think
he
can
order
the
state
to
appropriate
money.
mr.
randolph
well,
i
realize
that;
but
my
answer
to
your
question
is
precisely
the
same
answer
that
justice
holmes
gave
in
sanitary
district,
and
i
think
perhaps
analogous
to
the
answer
that
was
given
in
edelman
v.
jordan.
it
may
be
a
necessary
consequence
of
compliance
that
the
state
has
to
spend
money;
but
that's
of
no
concern
to
the
federal
government,
or
even
indeed
to
the
constitution
itself,
if
a
requirement
is
imposed
on
the
state
that's
a
valid
requirement
and
it
has
to
meet
it.
the
consequence
may
be
appropriation
of
money.
i
think
the
consequence,
for
example,
of
complying
with
the
regulations
in
united
states
v.
california
on
a
railroad
may
be
the
appropriation
of
money.
the
consequences
of
complying,
for
example,
with
a
municipal
incinerator,
regardless
of
what
you
require
the
state
to
do,
may
be
the
expenditure
of
money.
mr.
randolph
the
administrator
will
say
the
state
must
have
an
inspection
and
maintenance
program
that
is
adequate
to
do
the
following
such-and-such
and
such-and-such,
whatever
detail
is
required.
one
thing
that's
been
lost
is
--
mr.
randolph
i'm
not
clear
why
you
think
it's
another
thing.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
only
objection
i
think
that
could
be
made
to
that
is
that,
well,
what
you're
doing
is
requiring
the
state
to
exercise
its
police
power;
that
is,
it
is
enforcing
federal
law
against
its
citizens.
if
you
require
the
state
to
set
up
a
program
and
it
takes
10,000
people,
yes,
that
is
what
you
are
--
but
the
court
has
never
viewed
that,
so
far
as
i
am
aware,
as
a
constitutional
objection.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
mr.
randolph
does
the
statute
authorize
it?
i
see
nothing
in
the
statute
that
prevents
it.
mr.
randolph
yes.
number
one,
the
state
has
to
have
an
implementation
plan.
if
the
state
doesn't
have
an
implementation
plan,
the
epa
has
to
substitute
an
implementation
plan
for
the
state.
under
that
implementation
plan,
any
owner
of
a
source
of
pollution
can
be
required
to
abate
the
pollution.
epa’s
argument
in
this
case,
which
i
said
is
fundamental
to
the
case,
is
that
the
state
is
an
owner
of
a
source
of
pollution
and
therefore
can
be
required
to
abate
that
pollution,
just
as
if
the
steel
industry
was
required
to
hire
10,000
people
in
order
to
abate
the
pollution
that
they
cause.
we
treat
them
no
differently,
that's
the
extent
of
the
argument
here,
and
there's
nothing
under
the
statute.
the
statute
says
"any
person".
it
defines
the
state
as
a
person.
if
the
state
can
be
required
to
clean
up
the
pollution
as
a
result
of
its
municipal
incinerators,
it
can
be
required
to
clean
up
the
pollution
as
a
result
of
the
air
pollution
from
the
highways,
or
from
the
sewer
systems.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
distance
between
sewer
systems
and
highways
i
don't
think
is
a
very
large
distance.
sewers
systems
are
to
the
water
what
the
highways
are
to
the
air:
they
both
collect
pollution,
the
pollution
comes
from
private
sources
and
yet
the
state
owns
both,
and
we
think
the
state
is
responsible
for
both
and
it's
not
just
us,
i
think
this
court
has
so
held.
i
think
the
sanitary
district
case
stands
for
that,
i
think
the
city
of
milwaukee
v.
illinois
case
stands
for
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
even
further,
because
the
court
held
there
that
even
in
the
absence
of
federal
law,
the
court
was
going
to
create
federal
law
to
govern
just
that
kind
of
pollution,
and
it
indicated
in
dictum
probably,
that
it
would
do
the
same
in
regard
to
the
ambient
air.
mr.
randolph
you've
mentioned
grants
in
aid,
and
so
in
response
i'll
talk
about
that
for
a
minute.
if
you
mean
that
the
alternative
for
the
federal
government
in
this
case
is
offer
the
state
a
grant
in
aid
with
a
condition
attached,
and
if
they
accept
it
and
then
fail
to
live
up
to
conditions,
cut
off
the
money,
i
have
two
responses
to
that.
number
one,
that
was
what
the
history
of
the
act
was
before
this;
but
states
failed
to
take
the
money,
and
the
pollution
went
unabated.
number
two,
do
you
realize
that
that
puts
the
state
in
the
position
of
a
foreign
country?
i
mean,
we
might
as
well
say
to
china
please
don't
blast
in
the
atmosphere
anymore,
and
a
cloud
could
come
over
the
east
coast
of
the
united
states.
here,
we
will
offer
you
a
grant
in
aid,
we
will
put
conditions
on
it;
if
you
accept
it
and
then
don't
comply
with
the
conditions,
we'll
cut
it
off.
well,
we
think
the
states
are
in
somewhat
of
a
more
responsible
position
than
a
foreign
country.
if
you
mean
by
that,
however,
if
you
mean
something
more
than
that,
if
you
mean
that
the
$60
billion
that
is
flowing
into
the
states
each
year
from
the
federal
government,
what
we
should
say
is
unless
you
comply,
we're
going
to
cut
off
that
$60
billion.
we're
not
going
to
appropriate
money
for
you.
if
that's
the
point,
i
don't
see
any
difference.
the
lower
court
said,
well,
the
alternative
is
to
use
the
whip
of
coercion.
well,
that
is
like
using
the
death
penalty
for
a
misdemeanor.
i
mean,
one
of
two
things
can
happen:
either
an
awful
lot
of
people
are
going
to
get
killed
and
money
is
going
to
be
cut
off
all
over
the
place
for
the
slightest
violation,
or
else
it's
not
going
to
be
enforced;
it's
not
going
to
be
used.
mr.
randolph
yes,
i
think
they
could
close
it.
mr.
randolph
if
there
was
no
other
way
to
do
it,
i
think
that
would
be
true,
mr.
chief
justice;
but
there
are
other
ways.
under
the
war
powers,
we'd
move
them
right
down
the
highway.
mr.
randolph
yes.
mr.
randolph
yes,
but
that
would
--
sorry.
mr.
randolph
well,
that
would
be
requiring
them
to
own
another
pollution
source,
and
i
don't
think
we
could
do
that.
mr.
randolph
because
what
we're
doing
is
requiring
them
to
control
the
source
they
already
have
rather
than
telling
them
to
own
another
one,
buy
another
one.
mr.
randolph
well,
yes,
i
think
that
is
the
same
thing;
i
think
it's
requiring
them
to
own
more
property,
and
we're
not
requiring
them
to
do
that.
we're
polluting
another
source
of
pollution.
what
we're
trying
to
do
is,
if
they
have
this
source
of
pollution
and
are
the
owners
of
it,
they
invite
people
on
it,
then
people
should
use
it
in
a
way
that
doesn't
cause
harm
to
others
or
other
states.
mr.
randolph
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
that
could
be
required.
mr.
randolph
it
was
not
only
that,
mr.
justice
powell;
i
think
that
the
sanitary
district
case
stands
for
that,
and
we
cited
the
history
of
that.
the
fact
is,
the
city
of
chicago
had
an
inadequate
way
of
disposing
of
its
sewage.
it
ran
it
by
draining
lake
michigan
and
then
ran
it
down
into
the
mississippi
river,
where
it
traveled
down
to
the
other
states
and
what
the
court
finally
held
there
was
that
the
city
of
chicago
had
to
devise
another
system,
and
i
think
we
quoted
in
a
footnote.
mr.
randolph
well,
the
highway
deposits
--
mr.
randolph
well,
i
think
the
best
precedent
is...
mr.
randolph
corpus
juris
secundum
black-letter
law
that
says
the
owner
of
a
piece
of
land
invites
some
--
mr.
randolph
whether,
in
fact,
it
is
the
highway
that's
the
polluter.
mr.
randolph
we
are
not
saying
the
highway
is
the
polluter,
obviously,
the
stuff
comes
out
the
--
mr.
randolph
but
the
sewer
system
--
mr.
randolph
the
sewer
system
is
not
a
polluter
in
that
sense,
either.
it
collects
matter
from
citizens
and
deposits
it.
mr.
randolph
the
highway
collects
air
pollution
from
citizens
and,
instead
of
depositing
it
into
the
streams
and
waterways
of
the
country,
throws
it
up
into
the
air
and
allows
it
to
travel
throughout
the
rest
of
the
49
states,
depending
upon
which
way
the
wind
blows.
mr.
randolph
no,
it
travels
up
into
the
air
and
off
into
the...
mr.
randolph
that's
right.
so
if
the
state
can
simply
put
in
a
complex
of
highways
and
say
our
citizens
living
here
will
not
do
a
thing
about
controlling.
we
won't
do
a
thing
about
controlling
the
air
pollution
from
the
vehicles,
because
we
are
a
state
that
has
the
fortune
of
being
upwind
from
anybody
else.
but
we
do
not
have
to
do
anything;
and
that
means
that
when
the
wind
blows,
then
all
the
states
downwind
get
it.
mr.
randolph
that's
right.
mr.
randolph
yes,
force
the
states
to
take
on
the
responsibility
that
we
think
they
have
as
component
parts
of
this
union
and
to
put
it
in
governor
sergeant’s
words,
speaking
for
the
national
governors
conference,
to
not
be
allowed
to
simply
say,
well,
let
the
federal
government
do
it.
we
think
they
have
more
of
a
responsibility
in
this
case.
mr.
randolph
that's
right.
mr.
randolph
well,
i
think
we've
found
it,
and
i
think
our
briefs
talk
about
it
at
length.
mr.
randolph
that's
right,
yeah.
we're
not
saying
that
the
state
--
mr.
randolph
well,
i
don't
know
if
you
mean
by
mandatory
versus
prohibitory,
that
kind
of
a
line.
i
don't
think
i
can
say
that
the
administrator
is
issuing
new
regulations
that
will
just
prohibit
the
states
from
doing
that.
they
may
be
mandatory,
yes.
mr.
randolph
i
don't
want
the
court
to
hold
that.
mr.
randolph
well,
now
you're
asking
me
a
constitutional
question.
certainly
not
under
the
statute;
but
if
you're
asking
me
a
constitutional
question,
i
would
say
maybe
and
the
reason
i'd
say
that,
the
reason
i
can't
give
a
definite
answer
is,
i
think
the
case
would
have
to
be
analyzed
under
national
league
of
cities.
and
as
far
as
we've
gone
through
the
calculus
and
the
difference,
and
we're
talking
one
difference
automatic
in
the
case
that
you
posed
is
that
air
pollution
travels
from
one
state
to
another.
mr.
randolph
no,
we're
not
claiming
that.
we're
not.
if
we
had
claimed
that,
mr.
justice
white,
then
the
limit
of
our
argument
would
not
be
in
regard
to
highways.
we
would
be
saying
that
the
administrator
can
require
a
state
to
enforce
all
of
the
requirements,
like
for
example
with
respect
to
steel
plants,
with
respect
to
smelters,
with
respect
to
any
other
pollution-casing
activity
by
private
industry
within
the
state,
the
administrator
would
be
standing
up
here
and
saying
to
the
court
that
if
we
promulgate
a
substitute
plan
or
even
if
the
state
has
a
plan,
we
can
require
the
state
to
enforce
it
against
private
people,
we're
not
saying
that.
mr.
randolph
if
they
are
the
owner
of
a
source
of
pollution
and
since
i
mentioned
national
league
of
cities,
i'd
like
to
at
least
spend
some
time
on
that
case.
the
briefs
--
mr.
randolph
right.
mr.
randolph
the
state
does
not
own
the
smelter
in
any
way.
mr.
randolph
the
difference
is
that
if
the
smelter
were
on
state
land,
we
could
require
the
state
to
not
allow
it
to
be
used
for
that
purpose,
for
smelting
purposes.
if
the
private
automobile
is
on
state
land,
we
can
do
the
same.
that's
the
difference.
the
difference
is
that
when
a
landowner
allows
somebody
else
to
use
his
property
--
mr.
randolph
right,
but
the
highway
is,
and
without
that,
the
automobile
would
not
be
polluting.
mr.
randolph
yes,
sir.
mr.
randolph
absolutely,
then
we'd
be
regulating
the
turnpike.
mr.
randolph
if
we
argued
that
it
was
the
fact
that
they
had
the
police
force,
if
we
argued
this
--
mr.
randolph
let
me
pull
out
the
statute.
if
the
court
turns
to
110,
i'll
read
it
--
which
is
the
requirements
that
have
to
be
in
an
implementation
plan
--
mr.
randolph
well,
maybe
i
ought
to
refer
to
the
briefs,
then.
mr.
randolph
well,
that
says
for
section
110.
in
section
110(g),
it's
required
that
the
implementation
plan
that
the
state
imposes
provides
to
the
extent
necessary
for
periodic
inspection
and
testing
of
motor
vehicles
to
enforce
compliance
--
mr.
randolph
7a.
mr.
randolph
to
enforce
compliance
with
applicable
emissions
standards.
now,
if
the
state
doesn't
have
that
in
its
plan,
epa
can
require
it.
all
the
states
here,
with
the
exception
i
think
of
california,
had
such
a
requirement
in
their
plan.
mr.
randolph
well,
this
section
110
deals
with
the
state
in
both
capacities.
mr.
randolph
if
it
doesn't
deal
with
--
in
the
case
of
any
implementation
plan,
it
has
to
include
this
as
(b):
emission
limitations,
schedules,
timetables
for
compliance
with
limitations,
"and
such
other
measures
as
may
be
necessary
to
assure
attainment
of
their
plan".
mr.
randolph
the
entire
section
110
speaks
to
the
state
in
both
capacities,
and
it
must,
because
if
it
does
not,
then
a
state
would
be
under
no
obligation
in
an
implementation
plan
promulgated
by
them
or
by
the
federal
government
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
that
plan.
mr.
randolph
to
regulate
itself.
it
must
be
under
those
requirements
that
110
must
mean
that,
and
the
reason
it
must
is
because,
number
one
--
and
the
states
admit
this
--
if
they
have
a
municipal
incinerator,
they
have
to
comply.
mr.
randolph
i
will
readily
admit,
you
cannot
read
section
a
to
get
to
that
conclusion,
like
you
cannot
read
a
lot
of
other
statutes.
mr.
randolph
it
does
not.
it
does
say
that
transportation
controls
have
to
be
put
on,
and
that
is
on
page
6a,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
randolph
yes,
we
think
the
legislative
history
supports
that.
we
think
that
if
you
read
the
statute
any
other
way,
then
what
you
wind
up
with
is
a
statute
that
makes
no
sense
as
regard
to
municipal
incinerators.
if
you
say
110
doesn't
mean
the
state
can
be
enforcing
something
against
itself,
then
i
don't
know
what
you
do
with
the
respondents'
concession
in
this
case.
it
must
be
--
mr.
randolph
yes.
mr.
randolph
that
would
be
a
very
bold
claim
by
the
administrator,
and
he
makes
no
such
claim
here
and
the
reason
it
would
be
bold
--
mr.
randolph
yes,
the
reason
is
because
we
would
then
have
to
say,
and
we
don't
say,
that
simply
because
the
state
has
the
power
to
regulate
a
certain
activity,
therefore
the
epa
administrator
can
require
the
state
to
regulate
that
activity.
that
would
mean
that
the
epa
administrator
could
require
them
to
control
private
smelters,
could
require
them
to
control
anything.
mr.
randolph
we
have
never
imposed
any
such
requirement,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
say
that
the
state
can
be
required
to
close
down
a
source
of
pollution
that
it
owns
if
that's
absolutely
necessary
for
compliance.
in
fact,
what
you
mean
by
closing
down
the
highways
is
probably
that
people
use
other
means
of
transportation,
for
example.
i
don't
know
whether
maybe
block
them
off
or
something.
but
we've
never
made
that
kind
of
claim
here
--
i
mean,
the
administrator
realizes
the
difficulties
of
changing
habits
in
the
country.
this
is
demanding
legislation.
it
is
stiff
legislation.
the
reason
it
is
stiff
is
because
we
had
done
nothing
about
it,
and
something
had
to
be
done;
controls
had
to
be
imposed,
primary
responsibility
of
the
states
had
to
be
met,
and
i
think
the
court
said
in
nrdc
v.
train
that
the
innovation
of
the
statute
was
that
under
the
act
that
states
had
no
choice
but
to
meet
that
responsibility.
are
they
responsible
for
the
pollution
coming
from
the
highways?
we
think
they
are.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
at
least
a
word
about
national
league
of
cities.
we
don't
believe
the
federal
laws
cross
the
line
marked
out
by
the
court
in
that
case
and
there
is
one
difference
between
this
case
and
national
league
of
cities
that
i
think
is
immediately
apparent.
unlike
national
league
of
cities,
the
activity
here
is
not
one
that,
to
use
the
words
of
that
decision,
is
essential
to
the
separate
and
independent
existence
of
the
states
and
what
is
more,
the
respondents
admit
it
is
not.
i
will
tell
the
court
why.
they
say
that
if
the
operation
of
their
transportation
systems
has
to
be
modified
to
reduce
air
pollution,
the
federal
government
should
do
it.
i
submit
that's
an
admission
that
the
activity
that
we're
talking
about
is
not
one
that's
essential
to
the
existence
of
the
states,
why
not?
because
they
say,
well,
we
want
the
federal
government
to
do
it.
if
it
were
essential
to
their
continued
existence,
they
would
be
making
no
such
claim.
there
was
no
such
claim
made
in
the
national
league
of
cities'
case
by
the
states
that
the
federal
government
should
come
in
and
control
their
employees.
thank
you.
mr.
randolph
well,
mr.
justice
powell,
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
only
regulation
that
was
struck
down
in
that
case,
there's
only
one
regulation
struck
down
in
the
ninth
circuit,
sir.
mr.
randolph
the
regulation
on
page
439
of
the
appendix.
if
you
look
at
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit,
that's
the
only
regulation
that
was
struck
down,
and
that's
the
enforcement
regulation.
mr.
randolph
arizona
and
california.
i
might
add
that
arizona
has
an
inspection
and
maintenance
program,
a
mandatory
requirement;
they're
doing
what
we
say
the
states
have
to
do
in
this
case,
and
it
is
not
entirely
clear
to
me
why
they're
a
party
to
this
litigation.
it
is
52.23,
which
is
the
general
violation
and
enforcement
and
that's
struck
down,
the
court
held
in
the
ninth
circuit,
because
it
says
in
there
that
a
governmental
entity
can
be
a
violator
of
a
plan.
we
think
that's
absolutely
consistent
with,
for
example,
section
307
of
the
act,
which
i
didn't
get
to.
it
says
a
citizen
can
sue
any
person
that
violates
a
plan,
including
a
governmental
entity,
subject
to
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
randolph
an
injunction.
mr.
randolph
well,
the
administrator
has
said
that
we're
not
going
to
use
criminal
sanctions,
even
if
they
were
available.
mr.
randolph
in
a
citizen’s
suit,
it's
an
injunction,
yes,
sir.
mr.
randolph
i
don't
want
to
say
that
that's
going
to
happen.no.
if
it
had
to
happen,
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
randolph
it's
an
injunction.
mr.
randolph
i
haven't
finished
my
answer.
mr.
randolph
that
is
the
only
regulation,
mr.
justice
powell,
that
was
struck
down.
mr.
randolph
in
the
ninth
circuit,
in
california
and
arizona.
now,
let's
stick
to
the
ninth
circuit
for
a
moment.
we
petitioned
--
mr.
randolph
oh,
yes
that
is
the
statutory
question,
yes.
they
struck
it
down
with
statute,
yes.
we
petitioned
raising
the
question,
number
one,
whether
the
epa
could
require
the
state
to
take
action
when
it
owned
a
pollution
source,
namely,
the
highways.
second
question,
whether
it
would
be
constitutional
for
epa
to
do
so
in
regard
to
inspection
and
maintenance
programs.
the
only
program
that
we've
petitioned
on
was
inspection
and
maintenance.
now,
we
did
that
for
a
number
of
reasons,
i
won't
go
into
them
all;
but
one
of
them
is
that
it's
the
one
program
that's
specifically
mentioned
in
the
statute.
the
legislative
history
we
think
is
crystal-clear
that
the
congress.
now
the
statements
that
we
quoted
that
congress
said,
yes,
states
must
do
that.
every
governor
and
every
mayor
is
going
to
have
to
do
this,
it
is
very
tough;
but
we're
very
sorry,
you're
going
to
have
to
do
it,
because
it's
the
only
way
that
we're
going
to
get
air
pollution
down
to
the
quality
that
protects
human
life
and
welfare.
now,
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
a
number
of
regulations
were
upheld;
but
we
narrowed
our
case
down
to
the
same
point
that
the
only
thing
we
petitioned
on
was
inspection
and
maintenance.
so
the
only
regulations
that
are
in
issue
in
the
district
of
columbia
are
those
in
regard
to
maryland,
the
district
of
columbia
and
virginia
that
deal
with
inspection
and
maintenance.
mr.
randolph
and
52-23,
which
applies
to
all
programs.
mr.
randolph
that's
out
of
the
case.
the
only
reason
the
bus
purchase
is,
there
were
only
two
other
programs
that
were
in
issue
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
result
of
a
cross-petition
by
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
they
put
in
bus
purchases
as
an
issue;
they
put
in
bus
lanes
as
an
issue.
the
bus
purchases
is
out
of
the
case;
the
bus
lanes
issue
is
still
on
the
case
and
with
respect
to
the
district
of
columbia,
and
those
regulations
are
all
summarized
on
page
606
of
the
appendix.
mr.
randolph
no,
no.
i
was
going
to
say
before
the
one
thing
that
is
--
i'm
glad
you
brought
that
up.
they're
not
in
the
case
because
not
on
any
constitutional
ground
and
not
even
on
any
statutory
grounds,
they're
not
in
the
case,
because
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
held
that
they
weren't
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
there
was
no
indication
that
they
would
be
a
substantial
device
to
avoid
pollution,
and
we
have
acquiesced
in
that
decision.
every
one
of
the
regulations
that
the
epa
administrator
would
impose
upon
a
state
is
subject
to
the
test
that's
always
applicable
to
administrative
action
--
is
it
arbitrary
or
capricious?
does
it
meet
substantial
evidence
and
i
think
the
court
can
rest
assured
that
when
it's
a
state
on
the
other
side
claiming
that
its
sovereignty
is
somehow
infringed
by
the
regulation
that
that
kind
of
a
test
will
be
administered
with
great
care
by
the
courts
to
make
sure
that
what
the
epa
administrator
is
imposing
is
not
something
that's
arbitrary
or
capricious,
which
may
take
all
the
hypotheticals
that
i've
talked
about
wouldn't
even
reach
the
question
of
a
constitutional
stage
if
a
court
said,
no,
we
don't
think
that
there's
substantial
enough
evidence
to
support
those
regulations.
mr.
randolph
fine,
i'd
be
happy
to
provide
one.
mr.
randolph
yes,
sir.
mr.
randolph
that's
all,
yes;
and
bus
lanes
only
for
the
district
of
columbia
region,
that's
all.
there
are
bus
lanes
in,
for
example,
baltimore
and
various
cities
in
california;
but
we
don't
think
that
the
court
gets
to
that
question,
because
we
didn't
petition
from
this
--
mr.
randolph
yeah,
it's
far
from
clear
to
me
up
to
now
what
is
left
in
this
case.
mr.
randolph
yes.
the
retrofit,
for
example,
fell
out
of
the
case,
because
the
cases
in
those
were
required
for
pre
'68
vehicles
and
we've
gone
now,
what,
nine
years
from
’68.
i
mean,
there's
no
use
requiring
it;
those
are
all
off
the
highways.
mr.
randolph
because
they're
off
the
highways
now,
so...
mr.
randolph
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
take
less
time,
and
it
appears
i
have
taken
more.
