but
as

suggested,
all
we
have
to
do
is
complain
a
little
more
and
you
will
have
to
pay
the
tax,
the

this

involves
a

state
tax
on
the
transfer
of

under
the

what

and

the
tax
in

courts.
the

sustained
the
tax
against

--
against
the
challenge
that
is
based
on
a
commerce
clause.
we
reverse
that
judgment.
in
our
view,
the
tax
does
represent
discriminatory
burden
on
the
interstate
commerce
and
then
precisely,
the
kind
of
evil
in
which
the
commerce
clause
was
in.
accordingly,
the
judgment
is
reversed.
