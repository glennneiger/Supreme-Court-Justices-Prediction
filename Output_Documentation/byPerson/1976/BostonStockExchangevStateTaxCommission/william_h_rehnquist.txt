sometime
during
your
argument
are
you
are
going
to
treat
the
effect
of
the
enactment
of
section
28-d
of
the
securities
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
whether
or
not
it
moots
it,
it
conceivably
could
have
an
effect
on
the
burden
that
the
new
york
tax
does
put
on
congress.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that’s
administrative
procedure
act
standing,
conceivably
you
can
carry
it
over
if
you
want
to
into
this
area
but
i
don’t
think
it
follows
as
the
night,
the
day.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
come
they
don’t
realize
it?
