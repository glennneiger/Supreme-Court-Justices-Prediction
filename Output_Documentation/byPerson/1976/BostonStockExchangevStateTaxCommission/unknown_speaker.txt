unknown
speaker
the
challenge
here
is
only
on
the
commerce
clause.
unknown
speaker
whatever
else
relied
on
the
state
court
to
abandon.
unknown
speaker
they
did
not
think
it
already
was?
unknown
speaker
there
are
causing
a
burden
on
those
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
do
the
jurisdiction
in
which
these
regional
exchanges
operate
impose
no
local
transfer
taxes
whatsoever?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
pbw
in
the
stock
exchange?
unknown
speaker
and
these
names
listed
as
plaintiff’s
appellants
on
the
appellants
brief,
all
of
the
plaintiffs
is
appellants?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
we
will
not
ask
you
to
spend
the
minute-and-a-half,
we
will
resume
at
1
o’clock.
mr.
bush
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
unknown
speaker
just
one
tax
will
you
all
add.
unknown
speaker
we
have
the
figures
of
theirs,
the
aggregate
amount
of
the
tax
shown
on
the
records?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
your
friend
is
complaining
about
that
that
is
a
pretty
heavy
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
unknown
speaker
you
may
suggested
that
28-d
is
going
to
reduce
the
return,
did
you
suggest
how
much
if
it
would
have
been
about
$200
billion
annually
wealth?
unknown
speaker
and
what
would
be
the
effect
of
28-d?
unknown
speaker
that
was
about
a
130…
unknown
speaker
well
do
you
think
the
interstate
commerce
argument
would
be
different
than
this
case,
mr.
bush
if
instead
of
earmarking
the
tax
proceeds
for
big
mac
that
earmark
has
raised
governor
carey’s
salary
to
$5
million
a
year.
unknown
speaker
other
than
your
inspection
fee
type
case,
have
our
interstate
commerce
burdened
decisions
ever
given
any
intimation
that
the
purpose
for
which
the
state
uses
the
proceeds
of
the
tax
effect
the
termination
is
to
whether
or
not
it
burdens
interstate
commerce?
unknown
speaker
well
there
is
the
federal
question
turn
on,
how
worthy
we
regard
the
cause
to
which
the
proceeds
are
put?
unknown
speaker
do
not
we
assume
that
all
taxes
are
for
good
purpose
and
that
all
taxes
are
money
that
the
state
needs?
do
not
we
assume
that…
unknown
speaker
what
good
is
this
argument?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
the
state
of
new
york
looses
$30
million
has
gone?
unknown
speaker
but
there's
some
part
in
terms
of
what
lies
in
the
newspaper
they
said
you
needed
a
whole
lot
more
than
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
not
put
a
hate
tax
of
$100.00
on
everybody?
the
fact
that
you
need
the
money
does
not
seem
we
need
to
help
you
to
protect
you
against
the
constitutional
infirmity
of
the
statute,
if
the
statute
constitutionally
affirms
the
fact
that
you
need
the
money,
we
will
help
you.
unknown
speaker
i
submit
that,
that
is
the
argument
that
we
are
here
to
listen
to.
unknown
speaker
we
will
assume
that
new
york
needs
the
money.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bush
i
might
interrupt
you,
am
i
correct
though
in
understanding
that
there
is
one
rate
of
tax
paid
if
the
transaction
is
over
the
exchange
in
a
different
rate
but
it
is
not,
if
it
is
over
the
new
york
stock
exchange?
unknown
speaker
over
the
new
york
stock
exchange?
unknown
speaker
how
much
difference
in
rate
is
there?
unknown
speaker
now,
it
is
your
defense
that
it
is
the
differential
independant.
now
what
is
your
defense
again
that
these
are
not
interstate
transactions,
is
that?
i
really
do
not
understand
the
query
that
you…
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
reason
for
differentiating
them
for
having
two
different
levels
of
tax?
unknown
speaker
is
it
intended
to
affect
out-of-state
business?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
intended
to
change
the
way
in
which
out-of-state
business
would
be
done
but
for
this
particular
taxing
scheme?
unknown
speaker
is
it
correct
that
the
act
of
the
transfer
agent
generates
one
tax
if
the
prior
sale
was
made
over
the
chicago
exchange
and
a
different
tax
it
was
generated
over
the
new
york
exchange?
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
the
discrimination,
but
you
say
it
is
not
a
burden.
why
is
it
not
a
burden
again?
does
it
tend
to
discourage
transactions
over
the
chicago
exchange
by
companies
and
stock
of
companies
that
have
transfer
agents
in
new
york?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
answer
to
the
allegation
that
is
what
i
understood,
that
happens
does
it?
unknown
speaker
but
the
new
york
legislatures
indicate
what
is
the
purpose
along
the
lines
of
justice
stevens?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bush,
may
i
ask,
before
this
reduction
in
tax
was
the
old
right
such
a
burden
on
transfers
on
the
exchange
that
the
exchanges
were
suffering
and
this
is
why
they
want
to
leave
new
york
to
escape
to
tax?
unknown
speaker
was
it
losing
business
to
those
regional
exchanges?
unknown
speaker
then
the
idea
was
if
you
reduced
the
tax
in
the
manner
that
it
was
reduced,
this
would
not
only
retain
the
business
that
otherwise
will
be
lost
but
also
increase
the
amount
of
tax…
unknown
speaker
was
one
of
the
reason
it
was
losing
business
that
new
york
imposed
a
tax
on
transactions
on
the
new
york
exchange
and
the
other
states
did
not
impose
the
taxes
on
transactions
on
their
exchanges?
unknown
speaker
what
analogy
do
you
draw;
judge
walker’s
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
rested
one
point
as
i
read
it,
kind
of
on
the
use
tax
analogy.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
be
a
poor
lawyer
who
having
lost
in
two
appellate
courts
did
not
change
its
tactics.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
in
gibbons
against
ogden
like
new
york
could
have
argued
that
they
needed
the
revenues,
you
should
do
here?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
deliveries
that
were
affected
by
your
--
unknown
speaker
the
institutional
deliveries
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
bush,
did
you
challenge
the
standing
of
the
respondents
or
the
petitioners
here?
unknown
speaker
that
was
rejected.
unknown
speaker
what
was
your
standing
argument?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
what
was
your
standing
argument
in
it?
unknown
speaker
what
kind
of
standing
you
are
talking;
case
or
controversy
or
what?
unknown
speaker
you
say
they
did
not
suffer
any
injury
in
fact
from
these
taxes?
unknown
speaker
does
that
one
bind
those?
unknown
speaker
what
have
you
got
to
say
about
it,
do
you
hear
anything?
unknown
speaker
one
of
the
mechanics
of
paying
the
tax,
let
us
assume
i
live
in
boston
and
i
have
a
large
block
of
stock
to
transfer
and
i
called
my
broker,
tell
him
to
sell
it
in
boston,
he
sells
them
and
then
i
have
to
get
it
transferred
to
new
york.
so
i
will
have
to
pay
this
tax.
what
are
the
mechanics…?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose,
i
give
my
shares
to
my
broker.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
if
i
do
what
i
say
in
my
example,
i
pay
this
tax
in
new
york
and
i
am
talking
to
my
brother
in
new
york
and
he
says,
“well,
why
don’t
you
send
them
down
here
the
next
time
you
have
it,
it
will
only
cost
you
half
as
much,”
and
i
said,
“well,
i’ll
do
that
and
i
tell
my
broker
and
he
says,
“well,
that’s
great
except
that
now
i
don’t
get
a
commission.”
he
is
not
enough
heard
too.
unknown
speaker
what
is
evasion
i
am
just
trying
to
find
out
if
there
are
some
regional
stock
exchange
really
is
hurt
by
this
law?
it
is
quite
an
incentive
to
not
to
employ
the
services
of
the
local
stock
exchanges.
unknown
speaker
you’ll
hope
that’s
terribly
successful
because
you
want
to
bring
all
the
sales
in
a
new
york
account.
unknown
speaker
to
the
extent
you
are
successful,
to
that
extent
the
regional
exchanges
are
hurt,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
that
right
or
not?
unknown
speaker
or
maybe
they
might
have
gone
more.
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
know,
your
tax
system
is
devised
to
give
people
a
break
if
they
don’t
use
the
regional
exchanges.
unknown
speaker
isn’t
that?
unknown
speaker
are
you
taking
the
position
mr.
bush
that
the
congressional
act
here
makes
this
case
one
less
worthy
of
our
consideration?
unknown
speaker
your
time
is
up
mr.
bush.
pascal,
do
you
have
any
further
to
be
brief?
unknown
speaker
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
