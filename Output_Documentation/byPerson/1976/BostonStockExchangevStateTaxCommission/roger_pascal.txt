mr.
roger
pascal
mr.
chief
justice
may
i
please
the
court.
this
case
raises
the
constitutionality
of
a
1969
amendment
to
the
new
york
stock
transfer
tax
which
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce
by
taxing
stock
transactions
involving
sales
of
stock
outside
new
york
far
more
heavily
than
similar
transactions
involving
sales
within
the
state
of
new
york.
our
clients,
the
plaintiffs,
appellants
in
this
case
are
the
principle
stock
exchangers
in
the
united
states
located
outside
the
state
of
new
york,
located
in
the
states
of
massachusetts,
illinois,
pennsylvania,
ohio.
these
exchangers
compete,
your
honor,
with
stock
exchangers
located
within
the
state
of
new
york
and
indeed
with
each
other
to
provide
efficient,
fair
and
orderly
markets
for
the
purchase
and
sale
of
securities.
indeed,
the
securities
acts
amendments
of
1975
recognize
explicitly
the
public
interest
in
fair
competition
among
exchange
markets
to
provide
the
fair
and
orderly
markets
that
i
have
referred
to.
in
this
record
of
this
case
there
is
evidence,
all
be
not
at
a
trial
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
270-a
of
competition
in
specific
securities.
in
1968,
the
year
in
which
this
statute
was
passed
88%
of
the
share
trading
on
the
exchanges
who
are
plaintiffs
here
wasn’t
securities
listed
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
in
1968,
that
same
year
and
prior
to
that
time
the
governor
and
legislature
of
new
york
perceive
what
i
would
suggest
as
apparel,
a
competitive
apparel
of
what
one
legislative
witness
characterized
as
the
“competitive
problems
from
non-new
york
exchanges.
in
1968,
new
york
reacted
to
that
apparel
by
enacting
a
statute
which
added
section
270-a
to
the
new
york
stock
transfer
tax.
in
his
message
of
approval
the
governor
sighted
and
i
am
quoting
again,
“the
greatly
expanded
capacity
of
the
regional
exchanges
to
challenge
the
new
york
exchanges
for
business”.
regional
exchanges
are
what
people
in
the
business
in
new
york
called
exchanges
outside
of
new
york.
the
governor
also
stated
that
section
270-a
had
as
another
of
its
purposes
to
provide
and
i
am
quoting
again,
“long-term
relief
from
some
of
the
competitive
pressures
from
outside
the
state”.
the
non-new
york
exchanges
filed
suit
in
the
new
york
state
courts.
in
the
state
courts
because
the
anti-tax
injunction
statute
for
declaration
that
section
270-a
was
repugnant
to
the
commerce
clause
and
other
clauses
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
defendants
named
were
the
state
agency
charged
with
enforcing
that
statute,
collecting
the
tax
and
the
members
of
the
agency.
trial
court
denied
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
was
the
defendants’
response
to
the
complaint
and
under
new
york
procedure
that
denial,
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
appealed,
was
a
matter
of
right,
it
was
appealed
and
the
appellate
division
of
the
new
york
supreme
court
reversed,
ordered
the
complaint
dismissed
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
dismissal,
holding
section
270-a
to
be
constitutional
and
not
to
violate
the
commerce
clause
and
other
clauses
of
the
constitution
under
which
it
was
challenged
in
the
complaint.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal.
the
question
presented
here,
your
honor
is
whether
a
state
tax
on
the
sale,
transfer
or
delivery
of
securities,
stocks
in
this
case
which
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
whether
the
sale
portion
of
a
taxable
transaction
takes
place
inside
or
outside
the
state
of
new
york
violates
the
commerce
clause.
especially
whereas
here
it
is
uncontested
indeed
proclaimed
by
the
defendants
that
the
vowed
purpose
and
the
actual
effect
of
the
statute
was
to
confer
a
state
created
advantage
on
local
stock
exchanges
at
the
expense
of
their
out
of
state
competitors.
mr.
roger
pascal
that
is
correct.
mr.
roger
pascal
that
is
correct;
we
have
dropped
the
other
two
claims
in
the
complaint
which
were
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
and
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
discrimination
which
i
have
been
referring
to
your
honors
was
the,
i
would
suggest
direct
result
of
new
york’s
reaction
of
the
apparel
of
competition,
and
the
mechanism
of
the
discrimination
was
to
add
two
tax
reductions
in
two
large
areas,
and
i
say
large
because
very
little
is
left
of
pre-1968
scheme
after
the
addition
of
these
two
areas.
the
first
was
the
inclusion
in
section
270-a
of
a
new
limited
or
maximum
tax
of
$350,
actually
it
was
more
than
$350
when
it
was
passed
but
gradually
reduced
to
$350
by
the
year
1973.
since
1973,
therefore,
no
matter
how
many
shares
of
stock
one
sells,
one
is
subject
to
a
maximum
tax
of
$350
if
and
only
if
this
is
the
only
variable
the
transaction
takes
place,
the
sale
part
of
the
transaction
on
the
stock
exchange
takes
place
inside
the
state
and
not
outside.
the
second
aspect
of
section
270-a,
which
we
suggest
discriminates
openly
on
the
basis
only
of
where
the
sale
takes
place
is
a
new
--
what
i
have
chosen
referred
to
is
a
non-resident
discount.
whereby,
non-residents
of
the
state
of
new
york
pay
precisely
by
1973
and
since
that
time
one-half
the
tax
they
would
pay
if
they
were
to
execute
their
transactions
that
is
make
their
sales
inside
new
york
--
they
pay
half
as
much
if
they
execute
inside
new
york
as
if
they
sell
their
securities
outside
new
york.
mr.
roger
pascal
yes,
in
fact,
let
me
move
to
that
right
now
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
section
28-d
which
is
referred
to
in
our
reply
brief
as
well
as
the
appellee's
brief
had
the
effect
of
making
transfers
by
a
registered
transfer
agent
non-taxable,
the
legislative
history
of
28-d
is
that
was
an
accident.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
jurisdictional
statement
did
not
repeat
in
our
briefs,
“the
congress
did
not
intend
nor
did
the
president
intend
in
signing
it
to
reduce
the
impact
of
the
section
about
which
we
are
complaining.
president
made
a
statement
that
he
would
sign
remedial
legislation
and
both
houses
of
congress,
the
chairman
of
the
appropriate
committees
made
similar
statements.
the
fact
is
the
remedial
legislation
has
not
occurred
as
we
stand
here
right
now
and
obviously
will
not
during
the
session
of
congress.
but
section
28-d
clearly
does
not
moot
the
case.
number
one,
the
appellees
themselves,
certainly
i
can
speak
for
the
appellants,
they
do
not
think
it
has
been
mooted
or
we
would
have
so
advised
the
court.
mr.
roger
pascal
that
is
true
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
if
there
is
one,
just
one
registered
transfer
agent
in
new
york
it
will
reduce
the
number
of
transactions
it
would
otherwise
be
taxable
and
subject
to
this
discrimination.
there
are
certain
categories,
however
that
are
completely
ineffective.
for
example,
deliveries
to
people
living
in
new
york
the
large
institutional
purchasers,
sellers
of
securities,
deliveries
buy
and
two
such
persons
are
ineffective.
the
appellees
themselves
have
included
i
think
appropriately
an
appendix
c
in
their
brief
which
consists
of
the
opinion
of
their
counsel
mr.
crotty,
this
is
a
counsel
to
the
state
of
new
york
department
of
taxation
and
finance
holding
at
page
31
of
the
appellees
brief,
mr.
crotty
says
in
discussing,
this
is
an
opinion
dated
december
1,
1975,
in
discussing
the
impact
of
the
1975
amendments,
i
think
general
quite
accurately,
“however,
where
a
sale,
agreement
to
sell,
memorandum
of
sale
or
any
other
delivery
or
transfer
takes
place
in
new
york
state,
the
stock
transfer
tax
due
and
owing
thereon
must
be
paid."
he
is
telling
us
that
wherever
transfers
continue
to
take
place
and
non-registered
transfer
agents,
whenever
there
is
a
delivery
the
same
section
270-a
and
the
rest
of
the
stock
transfer
tax
continues
to
apply.
so,
i
would
suggest
certainly,
mr.
crotty
who
was
given
as
a
fairly
brief
but
concise
and
definitive
opinion
of
the
new
york
department
of
taxation
and
finance
of
which
by
the
way
the
defendant
commission
in
this
case
is
a
part.
i
think
he
can
be
taken
at
his
word
and
i
do
not
think
we
really
have
a
dispute
as
to
how
28-d
operates
or
the
impact
of
section
270-a
after
the
1975
amendments.
mr.
roger
pascal
yes,
mr.
justice
powell,
i
might
be
basically
trying
to
summarize
one
or
two
examples
given
on
page
8
of
our
yellow
reply
brief
but
the
one
that
we
give
first
and
the
one
that
i
think
is
somewhat
classic
is
an
example
of
new
york
life
insurance
company,
purchasing
securities.
it
is
either
required
by
law
to
have
a
custodial
agreement
or
to
take
possession
of
those
securities.
it
is
required
in
other
words
this
hypothetical
new
york
institutional
investor
or
life
insurance
company
in
the
example
i
have
given,
to
take
possession
of
those
securities,
when
it
takes
possession
whether
it
takes
possession
from
a
registered
transfer
agent
or
from
its
own
broker
the
mere
delivery
is
taxable
under
the
transfer
tax
now
as
always.
mr.
roger
pascal
that
is
correct,
that
is
precisely
the
situation
right
now.
delivery
is
an
important
event
and
it
is
one
that
occurs
frequently
in
new
york
and
it
is
one
that
persists
and
it
is
one
that
persists
particularly
with
regard
to
the
large
institutional
investors
in
new
york.
in
fact,
that
would
suggest
wholly
aside
from
mootness
and
even
in
terms
of
the
significance
of
the
case,
in
terms
of
the
kinds
of
considerations
that
the
court
normally
gives
at
the
beginning
of
a
case
ignoring
jurisdiction
that
has
not
changed
one
bit.
we
have
in
the
books
in
new
york
court
of
appeals
right
now,
the
decision
with
in
a
state
of
enormous
economic
power,
a
very
far
reaching
decision
that
condones
a
discriminatory
tax
scheme.
i
think
unlike
anything
close
to
anything
the
court
has
ever
dealt
with
and
found
to
pass
constitutional
muster
on
the
commerce
clause.
the
appellees
refer
to
the
extensive
regulations
promulgated
by
the
defendants
under
the
transfer
tax
they
are
indeed
extensive,
but
there
i
would
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
section
440.1-i
12
rather
simple
regulation
which
just
lists
a
number
of
different
types
of
taxable
transactions
and
further
answer
to
mr.
justice
powell’s
question,
one
of
those
types
of
transactions
is
the
delivery
of
a
certificate
by
the
transferor
or
his
agent
and
his
broker
to
the
transferee
or
his
agent
that
is
unchanged.
mr.
roger
pascal
well,
the
transaction
where
for
example
i
suppose
and
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
brennan
and
this
was
not
intended
but
it
does
probably
is
the
effect
right
now.
the
transaction
where
delivery
is
not
made
in
new
york
that
is
some
part
of
the
transaction
takes
place
there
but
it
is
made
outside
new
york,
where
no
delivery
is
made
at
all
or
delivery
is
made
to
--
i
suppose
a
registered
depository
or
clearing
agency,
but
if
delivery
is
made
that
part
is
unchanged,
and
i
would
add
that
the
policing
of
the
transfer
tax
is
done
through
the
brokers
in
new
york.
so
again,
you
can
see
how
the
delivery
still
is
something
the
state
can
and
does
get
at
and
according
to
the
appellees’
brief
and
mr.
crotty’s
opinion
intends
to
get
it.
mr.
roger
pascal
you
mean
after
the
impact
of
section
28-d?
mr.
roger
pascal
no
i
do
not
think
we
do
indeed
i
think
you
can
tell
from
the
date
of
mr.
crotty’s
opinion,
december
of
last
year,
things
were
still
being
worked
out
until
fairly
recently
and
the
record
in
this
case
has
been
frozen
for
a
few
years.
there
is
certainly
nothing
in
the
record
and
i
really
cannot
add
anything
to
it.
mr.
roger
pascal
yes
mr.
justice
blackmun
i
am,
i
think
it
has
baring
in
the
sense
that
while
the
court
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
reports
to
be
confronting
a
situation
of
first
impression
according
to
the
language
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
and
as
reemphasized
by
mr.
justice
stevens
concurring
opinion
and
that
situation
of
first
impression
is
not
present
here.
the
court
does
reinforce
what
i
would
call
some
very
steady,
consistent
varieties
regarding
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
i
think
that
the
court
itself
in
hughes
made
clear
that
it
was
dealing
with
a
situation
involving
the
state
itself,
state
of
maryland
and
hughes
really
becoming
the
entrepreneur
if
you
will
and
bidding
up
the
price
of
haux
i
think
of
taking
the
court,
the
language
of
the
court
in
the
majority
opinion
said
until
today
the
court
has
not
been
asked
to
hold
that
the
entry
by
the
state
itself
into
the
market,
as
a
purchaser
and
goes
on
to
talk
about
the
bidding
up
of
haux.
i
think
that
distinguishes
the
case
by
itself
mr.
justice
blackmun
because
there
is
no
suggestion
here
that
that
is
what
has
been
done.
indeed,
i
would
suggest
that
the
state
of
new
york
could
have
if
the
new
york
exchanges
and
their
continued
presence
in
new
york
were
so
important
to
the
state
and
it
has
continued
economic
liability,
it
could
easily
have
done
something
like
the
state
of
maryland
did.
it
could
have
decided
to
subsidies,
by
cast
subsidies
as
mr.
justice
steven
suggested
or
by
a
real
estate
tax
rebate.
it
could
have
done
something
that
would
not
have
impeded
interstate
commerce,
what
it
could
not
do
was
pass
a
statute
the
whole
purpose
of
which
was
to,
in
essence
shift
the
economic
burden
of
keeping
the
exchanges
located
in
new
york
to
their
other
state
competitors,
which
is
precisely
the
economic
effect
of
what
state
of
new
york
did
here.
the
defendants
and
the
court
of
appeals,
new
york
court
of
appeals
have
offered
us
some,
what
i
would
suggest
our
excuses
for
the
result
reached
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
for
section
270-a,
rather
than
avoidance
as
if
you
will
that
is
there
is
nowhere
in
the
court
of
appeals
indeed
to
the
contrary
it
is
assumed
that
section
270-a
does
create
a
discrimination,
i
do
not
think
that
is
an
issue
here.
one
excuse
suggested
by
the
defendants,
but
really
not
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
somehow
you
can
split
up
the
various
elements
of
the
transaction,
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
a
viable
theory
or
has
it
been
for
quite
a
long
time
at
least
since
nippert
againts
richmond
and
cases
of
that
kind
where
the
court
discussed
the
breath
of
the
mind
of
man
in
devising
ways
of
fragmenting
a
transaction.
the
motivation
of
protecting
the
local
business
is
something
on
which
we
can
agree.
i
would
suggest
that
ever
since
baldwin
against
seelig
the
halliburton
oil
well
company
against
reily,
nippert
against
richmond.
the
kind
of
discrimination
we
have
here
whether
it
is
tax
imposed
discrimination
or
regulatory
impose
discrimination,
it
makes
no
difference.
indeed,
freeman
against
hewit
one
of
the
cases
cited
by
defendants
suggested
that
the
tax
type
of
discriminatory
barrier
could
be
worst.
i
think
that
reinforced
in
mr.
justice
brennan’s
opinion
and
great
atlantic
and
pacific
tea
company
against
cottrell
last
term
also
in
which
the
court
said
that
a
state
cannot
erect
economic
barriers
to
protect
local
business
for
competition.
i
think
that’s
one
of
the
varieties
which
i
was
referring
to
that
would
not
fly
here.
what
do
we
have
here,
we
have
statements
in
the
briefs
and
motion
to
dismiss
by
the
appellee’s
that
the
purpose
of
section
270-a
was
to
protect
a
major
industry,
to
protect
and
preserve
the
state
securities
industry
and
this
one
to
make
new
york
the
financial
center
of
the
world
that
is
proclaimed
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
to
be
one
of
the
purposes
of
section
270-a.
mr.
roger
pascal
i
suppose
i
wanted
to
secure
their
position
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
that
is
what
is
wrong
with
the
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
also
suggested
that
the
and,
i
must
say
it
is
an
argument
that
is
somewhat
unique
so
one
cannot
sight
a
string
of
cases.
the
court
of
appeal
suggested
that
the
state
was
free
to
discriminate
among
different
types
of
interstate
transactions
that
what
was
really
being
done
here
was
discrimination
among
all
numbers
of
transactions,
all
which
were
interstate.
of
course,
we
could
go
to
halliburton
to
see
that
in
almost
every
case
where
that
kind
of
situation
occur,
where
you
had
discriminatory
tax
or
regulatory
burden
you
could
be
comparing
cases
all
of
which
had
interstate
elements,
it
is
important
here
and
what
i
think
is
really
again
undisputed
is
that
here
we
have
a
situation,
where
the
discrimination
operates
based
on
whether
a
particular,
very
important
element
of
the
transaction
occurs
inside
or
outside
the
state.
again,
the
court
of
appeals
suggests
and
this
relates
also
to
the
protection
of
local
businesses
point
that
it
can
neutralize
the
advantages
of
the
place
of
origin
that
is
since
new
york
has
already
imposed
the
tax
they
can
even
up
the
odds
as
it
were
with
the
out
of
state
businesses.
that
precise
language
virtually
is
what
is
used
by
the
court
in
baldwin
against
g.
a.
f.
seelig,
to
say
that
you
cannot
do
it
and
it
was
reinforced
in
halliburton
having
imposed
the
tax.
new
york
might
subsidize
its
businesses
and
might
grant
tax
rebates.
it
could
do
a
lot
of
things
to
help
local
businesses,
but
it
could
not
neutralize
the
advantages
of
the
other
states
and
the
securities
markets...
mr.
roger
pascal
exactly.
finally
there
is
a
suggestion
in
the
courts
of
appeals
argument
that
the
practical
effect,
that
is
a
quote
of
a
phrase
i
believe
from
best
against
maxwell,
the
practical
effect
of
the
tax
is
somewhat
de
minimis
because
new
york
residents
are
likely
to
execute
their
transactions
within
new
york
that
of
course
is
not
only
not
born
out
by
the
record,
but
it
flies
directly
into
the
face
of
legislative
history
of
those
who
passed
it.
the
very
assumption
of
section
270-a
was
that
within
the
modern
age,
with
modern
telecommunication
and
computer
systems
where
everybody
has
access
to
the
various
markets
instantaneously
and
where
the
instantaneous
communication
may
gain,
especially
a
large
institutional
seller,
such
as
exist
in
new
york.
particular
advantage
that
the,
all
markets
will
open
to
everybody
and
therefore
to
suggest
that
as
a
practical
matter
the
new
york
institutions
and
other
sellers
and
buyers
of
securities
who
stay
in
new
york
because
of
geographic
propinquity
is
something
that
is
absolutely
unsupported
in
fact
belied
by
the
record.
mr.
roger
pascal
that
is
correct,
none
of
them
do.
in
fact
i
think
the
only
other
state
in
the
union
which
might
impose
a
transfer
tax
similar
to
new
york
is
florida
and
i
am
not
even
sure
of
that
one
right
now.
mr.
roger
pascal
pbw,
well
name
has
changed
a
few
times,
it
is
the
pbw
is
stands
for
philadelphia-baltimore-washington
that
is
i
think
now
the
philadelphia
stock
exchange.
mr.
roger
pascal
they
are
all
six
of
them,
that
is
correct.
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
roger
pascal
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
suggest.
mr.
roger
pascal
well
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
injury
in
fact
to
which
mr.
justice
white
referred
is
the
direct
open-bald
attempt
by
the
state
to
take
her
customers
away.
it
is
competition
standing
and
that
is
why
the
court
of
appeals
as
well
as
both
courts
below
in
new
york
rejected
the
defendants
standing
argument,
relying
indeed
in
the
court
of
appeals
as
i
recall
upon
camp
data
processing
and
also,
there
really
is
no
difference
between
new
york
and
this
court’s
standing
doctrine
because
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
sighted
it
also.
mr.
roger
pascal
i
think
that
the
elements
have
not
come
together
in
the
interstate
commerce
case
that
i
know
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
that
the
elements
are
there
that
competitors-type
standing
in
other
cases
involving
the
control
of
the
currency.
mr.
roger
pascal
it
doesn’t
follow
as
night
follows
day
but
it
has
i
believe
and
subsequent
sighted
in
non-administrative
procedure
cases.
i
think
in
a
non-administrative
procedure
case
we
have,
pierce
against
society
of
sisters
which
was
among
other
things,
a
standing
case
and
i
think
that
that
is
another
case,
that
would
apply
here
where
you
have
the
or
true
acts
against
race
where
you
have
the
employee
who’s
employer,
is
required
to
discriminate
against
aliens.
the
employee
who
is
going
to
be
the
subject
and
who
is
really
going
to
be
burdened
could
complain.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
these
exchanges
are
the
only
potential
plaintiffs
here
but
if
you
compare
the
exchanges
who
are
--
this
is
i
think
a
rare
thing
in
state
legislative
history
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
you
actually
have
the
targets
of
this
legislation
named
in
the
legislative
history
that
the
defendants
put
in
the
record,
their
name.
they
are
actually
foreseen
as
the
targets
of
the
legislation,
the
competitors
of
the
local
exchanges
and
against
them,
the
legislation
is
aimed.
i
would
suggest
that….
mr.
roger
pascal
well
the
might
theoretically,
justice
white.
they
could
say
that
this
is
a
form
of
economic
coercion
that
reduces
their
choices
to
where
they
--
i
referred
earlier
for
example
to
competition
between
the
exchanges
…
mr.
roger
pascal
that’s
right.
mr.
roger
pascal
well
that’s
why
the
exchanges
are
the
plaintiffs.
i
think
that’s
right.
i
would
suggest
that
the
legislative
history
is
an
unusual
source
of
material
to
dispose
of
any
injury,
in
fact
problem
here.
i
would
also
like
briefly
to
discuss
the
--
suggesting
the
case
maybe
less
worthy
of
consideration
which
justice
blackmun
mentioned.
i
don’t
think
the
legal
principle
is
any
less
worthy
of
consideration
regardless
of
how
the
dollar
may
have
change,
and
i
would
agree
that
section
28(d)
really
changes
it
much
more
than
what
we
complain
of
here.
finally,
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
big
mac
argument
if
i
can
call
it
that
is
one
that
just
plain
surprises
me
but
it
is
an
easy
one
to
respond
to
because
to
quote
from
the
appellee’s
brief
on
page
3,
section
11
to
which
he
referred,
this
is
of
the
same
statute
we
challenged.
the
possibility
of
this
particular
section
being
on
constitution
occurred
to
the
new
york
legislature.
section
11,
requires
the
re-reimposition
of
the
higher
taxes,
the
higher
rates
of
taxation
without
distinction
between
sales
by
nonresidential
or
large
blocks,
if
section
270(a)
is
declared
unconstitutional.
we
are
doing
new
york
a
favor.
there
is
no
way
it
can
lose.
mr.
roger
pascal
i
am
afraid
that
the
time
to
ask
that
question
is
passed
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
can’t,
because
the
only
effect,
the
relief
we
see
could
have
would
be
to
reinstitute
the
previous
higher
tax.
we
have
never
challenged
in
any
court
or
even
whispered
the
suggestion
that
we
are
attacking
anything
more
than
section
270(a)
of
the
transfer
tax
which
does
not
impose
any
tax.
it
merely
creates
a
new
discriminatory
rate.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
