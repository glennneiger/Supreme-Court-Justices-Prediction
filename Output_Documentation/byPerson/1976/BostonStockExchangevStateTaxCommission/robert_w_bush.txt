mr.
robert
w.
bush
mr.
chief
justice
i
may
please
the
court.
if
you
like
to
emphasize
at
the
outset
then
this
review
constitutes
in
our
judgment
one
of
the
most
historic
cases
has
come
before
this
court
because
it
actually
means
the
economic
and
fiscal
solvency
of
the
state
of
new
york
together
without
the
city
of
new
york.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
well,
part
of
this
tax
is
earmark
to
guarantee
to
the
municipal
assistance
corporation
of
the
city
of
new
york,
the
federal
loans
which
congress
has
authorized
to
the
city
and
to
the
big
mac,
so
called
big
mac
corporation
under
legislation.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
it
has
shown
in
the
legislative
history
for
the
years
on
review.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
well
it
is
in
the
neighborhood
of
$200
million
annually
although
the
volume
has
decreased
since
the
enactment
of
the
28-d
last
year
of
the
sec
act.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
well,
we
do
not
think
there
is
any
burden
here
whatsoever,
your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
a
tax
does
not
operate
outside
of
the
state
of
new
york,
there
is
no
extra
territorial
tax
imposed
whatever.
either
upon
these
plaintiffs
or
upon
any
of
the
shareholders
who
do
not
sell
or
buy
or
sell
their
securities
in
the
state
of
new
york.
the
only
taxes
imposed
are
for
those
local
transactions
involving
sales
and
transfer
occurring
within
the
state
of
new
york.
and
of
course
these
plaintiffs
as
competing
stock
exchanges
are
not
taxed
at
all
upon
any
business
that
is
transacted
on
anyone
of
those
exchanges.
a
tax
occurs
only
if
there
is
a
sale
within
the
city
of
new
york,
on
one
of
our
new
york
exchanges
or
where
there
is
a
transfer
made
within
the
city
of
new
york
by
a
corporate
transfer
agent,
limited
solely
by
the
enactment
of
28-d
a
year
ago.
but
even
there
that
has
only
limited
application
here
because…
mr.
robert
w.
bush
well
that
was
a
roughly,
at
the
beginning
of
this
lawsuit
that
was
the
annual
yield
from
our...
mr.
robert
w.
bush
28-d
which
i
think
reduces
it
somewhere
around
$60,
$70
million
a
year.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
yes,
somewhere
in
there.
now
in
the
committee
report
to
the
big
mac
assistance
acted
last
year,
public
law
94-143
there
is
a
table
of
index
accompanying
that
senate
report,
which
shows
the
annual
yield
during
1975
or
the
fiscal
year
ending
last
in
75.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
prior
to
68,
your
honor,
the
revenue
from
this
tax
went
into
the
general
state
treasury
at
the
same
time
this
270-d
was
passed
the
revenue
was
transferred
to
the
city
of
new
york
for
general
purposes
and
then
during
the
fiscal
crisis,
the
revenue
was
earmarked
to
guaranty
to
the
federal
government
that
the
loans
borrowed
by
the
city
would
be
backed
up
in
part
by
the
revenue
from
the
stock
transferred
tax,
along
with
other
revenue.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
well,
if
i,
my
recollection
of
reading
those
cases
it
vary
with
tax
to
tax,
as
long
as
the
money
is
used
for
a
public
purpose
by
a
state
or
one
of
its
municipalities
and
it
is
a
legitimate
function
of
government.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
judicial
adjustment
has
to
be
made
case-by-case
where
the
nature
of
the
tax
involved
and
the
element
used
to
which
the
proceeds
maybe
put.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
i
think
in
part
it
does,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
the…
mr.
robert
w.
bush
i
would
think
so.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
well,
i
do
not
think
that
the
constitution
contemplates
especially
in
this
case
the
death
nail
of
the
sovereign
state
of
new
york
through
fiscal
collapse
which
is…
mr.
robert
w.
bush
it
maybe
gone
if
we
cannot.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
your
honor,
we
need
every
nickel
i
can
get,
and
part
of
it
is,
it
is
from
this
slot.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
well,
it
is
our
possession,
your
honor,
that
the
statute
has
not
infirmed
constitutionally.
there
is
no
burden
imposed
on
any
commerce
interstate
or
otherwise
whatsoever.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
that
is
right.
that
is
the
question
before
this,
but
part
of
that…
mr.
robert
w.
bush
we
need
it
desperately,
there
is
no
question
about
it,
but
i
mentioned
this
public
assistance
because
at
the
same
time
that
that
was
passed
last
year
and
the
congress
had
before
the
consideration
of
the
amendments
to
the
sec
act
one
of
which
was
this
amendment
28(d)
but
that
did
not
divest
the
state
of
new
york
of
its
taxing
power
in
other
areas,
on
the
transactions
within
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
sale
of
securities.
28(d)
merely
limited
the
tax
or
exempted
the
tax
for
transfers
within
the
state
of
new
york
not
on
another
types
of
transactions
within
the
state,
that
power
was
not
affected
by
congress
whatsoever.
now
i
do
not
really,
the
question
was
asked
earlier
about
the
relevancy
of
this
huge
decision
that
was
handed
down
last
june.
as
i
read
the
opinion
there
it
constitutionally
was
sustained
because
it
was
a
legitimate
purpose
of
the
state
of
maryland
for
the
protection
of
its
environment
to
do
something
about
ridding
itself
of
those
junk
automobiles.
it
looks
important
from
an
environmental
point
of
view
to
preserve
the
state
of
maryland
i
think
for
the
same
reason
it
is
important
to
the
state
of
new
york
for
its
economy
to
remain
wholesome
for
the
same
reasons
and
the
cases
relied
upon
by
the
plaintiffs
here
were
all
reviewed
and
passed
upon
in
the
hughes
opinions
of
last
spring
and
also
in
the
earlier
case
of
the
atlantic
and
pacific
company
case
it
was
handed
down
the
first
part
of
last
year.
the
cases
relied
upon
therein
are
precisely
the
same
as
those
which
are
relied
upon
by
the
plaintiffs
here,
now
in
the
a&p
case
this
court
found
that
the
very
same
cases
were
controlling
as
to
the
facts
there
involved.
but
when
it
came
to
the
hughes
case
case
four
or
five
months
later
the
same
cases
were
rejected
by
the
majority
here.
so
that
our
position
is
that
all
of
these
cases,
plaintiff
site
have
got
to
be
distinguished
upon
their
facts
and
upon
the
illegal
principles
involved.
now
some
of
those
were
involved
a
license
to
engage
in
interstate
commerce
which
has
been
forbidden
under
the
commerce
clause
or
there
was
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
the
gross
proceeds
from
the
interstate
commerce,
and
others
were
involved
other
types
of
drumming
situation
in
sales.
now
none
of
those
cases
are
in
point
here
because
we
are
not
licensing
anyone
here
and
we
are
not
imposing
upon
a
privilege
for
someone
to
engage
in
its
sales
transaction
within
the
state
of
new
york.
every
stockholder
in
this
country
is
free
to
buy
and
sell
his
stock
on
any
exchange.
the
tax
is
only
applied
by
new
york
where
there
is
a
sale
within
the
state
of
new
york,
or
a
subsequent
transfer
within
the
state
by
a
corporate
transfer
agent.
unless
those
events
occur,
no
tax
is
paid
by
anybody
regardless
of
where
the
sale
maybe
made,
whether
it
is
on
plaintiffs’
exchanges
or
off-the-counter
or
over-the-counter
type
of
transaction,
and
it
seems
ironic
to
us
that
the
plaintiffs
are
complaining
that
the
competitive
standing
of
our
new
york
stock
exchanges
in
comparison
to
theirs
and
that
the
state
ought
to
offer
bounties
or
subsidies
to
our
own
exchanges
similar
to
what
was
done
in
hughes
situation,
merely
begs
this
little
question.
new
york
has
done
something
to
equalize
a
competitive
standing
and
it
did
so
by
the
enactment
of
the
special
tax
inducement
provisions
of
section
270(a)
of
the
tax
law
to
encourage
out-of-state
investors
to
continue
to
engage
within
the
state
of
new
york
and
they
offered
non-resident
citizens
a
tax
reduction
in
order
to
do
that,
and
it
offered
on
the
other
hand
that
the
large
block
sale
investors
special
tax
inducements
if
they
traded
within
the
state
of
new
york.
however,
they
are
still
free
to
trade
anywhere
where
there
is
a
market
for
them,
and
we
do
not
think
that
that
is
a
burden
upon
the
interstate
commerce,
in
fact
it
is
a
direct
inducement
to
engage
in
interstate
commerce.
now,
the
plaintiffs’
concede
in
their
briefs
submitted
here
that
the
state
has
the
taxing
power
to
impose
this
tax.
they
only
complaint
because
we
reduce
the
tax.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
if
it
is
done
within
the
state
of
new
york
we
offer
non-residents
a
reduced
tax
if
they
sell
within
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
over
the
new
york
state
residents.
new
york
state
residents
if
they
do
business
within
our
exchanges
they
are
taxed
at
the
former
rate,
at
a
higher
rate.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
well,
it
is
a
graduated
beginning
back
in
68
down
through
73
roughly
now
50%
less
for
out-of-state
non-resident.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
our
stock
transfer
tax
we
argue
is
at
the
end
of
commerce,
it
is
upon
a
sale
or
a
transfer
occurring
within
the
state
of
new
york
after
commerce
has
come
to
an
end.
it
is
not
a
direct
burden
on
the
flow
of
that
commerce
within
the
state
of
new
york.
we
take
the
position
and
commerce
has
ended,
the
flow
has
ended
and
ceased,
and
that
the
final
act
of
sale
or
transfer
within
the
state
of
new
york
is
purely
a
local
incident
which
this
court
has
sustained
in
the
past
against
constitutional
tax
as
a
burden...
mr.
robert
w.
bush
merely
as
an
inducement
to
bring
the
out-of-state
business
into
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
well,
you
mean
affected
by
keeping
it
out
of
the
state
or
bringing
it
in?
mr.
robert
w.
bush
well,
the
tax
has
no
extra
territorial
effect
if
there
is
no
later
transfer
within
the
state
of
new
york,
if
the
sale
is
made
on
say
at
chicago
exchange
the
tax
is
not
imposed
on
that,
it
is
only
if
that
stock
is
thereafter
transferred
within
the
state
by
a
corporate
transfer
agent
that
the
local
taxes
is
imposed
on
the
transfer
but
no
tax
is
imposed
on
an
out-of-state
sale.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
that
is
right!
mr.
robert
w.
bush
that
is
the
allegation
made
by
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
well,
i
think
it
does
happen
but
the
sec
is
reporting,
their
volume
goes
up
every
year
anyway
so
the
tax
itself
i
do
not
think
has
that
much
of
an
adverse
effect
upon
regional
exchange
located
in
chicago.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
the
purpose
was
to
retain
the
new
york
state
stock
exchanges
within
the
city
of
new
york
which
at
that
time
was
threatening
to
move
out
of
state
because
they
could
not
afford
to
continue
business
within
the
state,
and
that
is
part
of
our
legislative
history
which
is
shown
on
our
brief
and
also
in
the
new
jurisdictional
statement,
and
as
an
inducement
to
keep
those
exchanges
within
new
york
it
was
agreed
upon
by
the
city
of
new
york,
the
state
legislature,
the
governor’s
office
and
the
new
york
stock
exchange
that
something
had
to
be
done
and
one
means
of
doing
it
was
to
reduce
the
tax
for
future
years
on
this
type
of
transaction.
there
is
a
consequence,
the
exchanges
agreed
to
stay
within
new
york.
now,
the
effect
of
their
leaving
new
york
would
have
made
a
loss
of
millions
of
dollars
and
local
taxes
which
they
have
been
paying
up
to
them,
to
the
city
the
loss
of
employees
and
the
taxes
there
engendered
by
them
and
plus
the
rents
and
everything
else
which
are
involved
in
the
operation
of
these
exchanges,
and
of
course
new
york
city
has
been
the
financial
center
of
the
world,
it
is
recognized
by
the
congress
and
the
mandatory
acts
passed
last
year
with
respect
to
the
sec
amendments
that
are
involved
here.
all
of
which
were
enacted
to
preserve
the
new
york
city
as
the
financial
center
not
to
embarrass
it
nor
to
impede
its
growth
but
to
retain
it
for
the
purposes
of
having
adequate
financial
interest
in
the
city
and
to
provide
the
capital
and
everything
else
if
needed
in
a
growing
economy.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
that
was
part
of
it;
that
was
only
a
small
part
of
it,
your
honor
that
the
stock
exchange
thought
that
because
of
this
increased
competition
that
it
was
receiving
from
these
regional
exchanges
something
had
to
be
done.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
yes
it
was.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
hopefully,
it
would
bring
in
additional
business
into
new
york.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
yes
sir.
we
had
two
exchanges,
the
new
york
stock
and
the
amex
exchange,
both
dealing
with
different
listed
in
the
securities.
but
the
transfer
tax
it
was
involved
with
both
exchanges
for
both,
all
transactions
on
those
two
exchanges.
now
in
our
legislative
history
that
we
have
appended
to
our
brief
we
show
the
economic
statistics
that
are
involved
up
to
1968
and
the
concern
that
was
expressed
by
the
state
of
new
york
if
this
business
would
be
lost.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
well,
that
was
the
argument
that
we
were
making
in
the
court
below
that
the
transfer
tax
was
similar
to
a
local
sales
or
use
tax
in
the
city
of
new
york
and
which
has
been
constitutionally
sustained
in
the
past.
now,
the
thrust
of
plaintiffs’
argument
changes
from
court-to-court
as
we
proceed
with
this
litigation.
as
we
read
the
briefs
were
filed
in
the
courts
below
their
constitutional
thrust
on
the
interstate
commerce
question
was
not
to
themselves
but
to
some
stockholders
or
someone
--
investor
who
they
were
claiming
what
was
being
jeopardized.
now,
it
is
their
own
business
primarily
that
they
are
aiming
in
this
constitution.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
that
is
right,
that
is
right,
and
we
are
not
embarrassed
by
that,
we
i
think
met
this
head
on
and
at
every
stage.
as
i
say
to
repeat
myself,
we
do
not
see
that
there
is
any
undue,
unfair
burden
imposed
upon
interstate
commerce
at
all.
especially,
here
when
nobody,
when
none
of
these
plaintiffs
pay
any
tax
at
all
and
do
not
have
to
because
our
statute
does
not
reach
out
to
their
exchanges.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
well,
in
gibbons
in
that
line
of
case
your
honor
i
think
dealt
with
more
in
the
nature
of
the
license
fee
for
the
privilege
you
engaging
in
interstate
commerce
or
that
no
one
was
free
to
do
unless
they
had
a
permit
to
do
it.
we
do
not
impose
any
such
requirement
here
to
engage
in
a
stock
transaction.
everyone
is
free
to
sell
at
any
exchange
regardless
of
where
he
--
as
so
long
stock
maybe
listed
on
a
regional
exchange
limited
by
that
either
a
stockholder
is
free
to
pick
any
plaintiff’s
exchange
to
buy
or
sell
a
stock.
the
problem
becomes
one,
if
he
has
to
transfer
within
the
state
of
new
york
and
a
corporate
transfer
agent
is
located
here
the
stock
goes
to
new
york
to
that
agent
to
be
transferred
on
the
corporate
books
of
the
company
and
new
stock
issued.
but
even
that
is
going
to
be
eliminated
under
these
sec
amendments
because
the
recommendations
are
now
to
eliminate
all
stocks
typically
it
is
altogether
and
put
it
on
a
computerized
tape
situation
and
if
and
when
that
occurs
than
there
will
be
fewer
paper
transactions
involving
a
transfer
of
stock
certificates.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
well,
your
honor,
i
think
counsel
--
mr.
robert
w.
bush
counsel
i
think
has
misread
that
ruling
of
the
commerce,
the
counsel
of
the
tax
department
it
is
limited
to
the
specific
statutory
provisions
of
28(d)
of
the
sec
act
and
all
these
doing
as
rephrasing
that
language
and
it
says,
“either
delivery
or
transfer
within
the
state
of
new
york”.
so
those
two
types
of
transactions
are
now
limited
by
28(d).
any
other
type
of
transaction
is
still
subject
to
the
tax
and
the
committee
reports
that
recommended
this
legislation
made
clear
to
the
congress
that
they
were
non-intending
to
divest
the
state
of
new
york
of
any
other
additional
taxing
power
that
it
might
have,
commerce
or
otherwise,
and
they
recognize
i
am
sure
that
the
transfer
tax
was
merely
a
local
tax
which
is
court
has
held
in
the
past
on
certain
local
taxable
incidence
occurring
within
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
yes,
we
did
up
through
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
it
was
rejected.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
well,
i
think
that
this
court
of
its
own
motion
could
just…
mr.
robert
w.
bush
well,
what
we
urged
at
the
very
beginning
that
they
had
no
standing
to
maintain
the
law.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
they
were
not
aggrieved
because
no
tax
was
imposed
on
them
and
they
hadn’t
a
legal
standing
to
question
the
constitution.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
that
is
right
and
that
is
spelled
out
in
our
knowledge
of
motion
on
grounds
which
is
in
the
jurisdictional
statement,
mr.
justice
white
has
to
--
but
we
felt
that
since
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
way
it
did
that
it
decided
as
a
matter
of
state
law
that
they
did
have
standing
to
institute
and
maintain
the
lawsuit.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
no
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
well,
i
think
we
still
maintain,
your
honor,
that
they
have
no
standing
to
question
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
and
we
think
that
the…
mr.
robert
w.
bush
well,
most
of
the….
mr.
robert
w.
bush
that
is
right
and
he
has
ever
been
designated
as
a
stamp
issuer
and
affixes
the
stamps
to
the
paper
or
send
into
new
york
in
some
bank
or
some
other
member
firm
affixes
the
stamps
to
the
certificate.
refunds
of
course
are
provided
under
the
statute
in
case
of
an
erroneous
paid
tax
and
funds
are
set
aside
every
year
to
refund
any
taxes
that
might
have
been
erroneously
paid
or
collected.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
well,
the
article
twelve
of
new
york
state
tax
law
provides
for
penalties
in
the
event
of
evasion
and
things
like
that.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
that’s
right.
well,
i
don’t
know
to
what
extent
a
shareholder…
mr.
robert
w.
bush
that’s
right
and
we
want
to
retain
what
we...
mr.
robert
w.
bush
well
i
have
read
the
reports
of
the
sec.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
well,
no
because
the
sec
reports,
annual
reports
showing
their
volume
going
up
every
year.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
they
might
have
gone
out
more,
who
knows
that’s
a
matter
of
speculation.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
well,
all
i
can
say
is
that….
mr.
robert
w.
bush
our
revenue
was
falling
off
in
recent
years
from
what
it
was
back
at
the
time
when
this
thing
was
first
passed,
i
know
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
although
our
record
here
does
not
clearly
reflect
that.
the
table
that
was
submitted
with
public
law
in
401
and
403
that
big
mac
assistant
thing
shows
estimated
transfer
of
taxes
to
the
city
of
new
york
on
appendix
a
in
the
neighborhood
of
184
million
which
is
substantially
less
than
the
amount
that
we
estimated
back
at
the
time
this
lawsuit
was
started
and
which
was
in
the
neighborhood
of
250
millions.
so
it
has
fallen
off
significantly
and
it
no
doubt
will
as
time
goes
on,
especially
if
this
28(d)
is
not
modified
in
some
way
next
year
by
the
next
congress.
mr.
robert
w.
bush
i
think
it
does
since
this
legislation
was
enacted
because
i
think
it
indicates
the
unwillingness
of
congress
to
preempt
a
field
and
which
under
the
constitution
i
think
it
has
the
power
to
do,
that
has
not
yet
been
fully
done,
your
honor
but
i
don’t
think
the
constitutional
question
is
as
significant
today
as
it
was
three
or
four
years
ago
when
this
thing
was
first
started
and
i
think
that
hughes
opinion
sort
of
points
that
out
also.
