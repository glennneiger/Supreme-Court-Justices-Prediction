well,
mr.
hall,
the
cases
that
you
have
mentioned
say
that
on
the
basis
of
pure
statistics
and
a
simple
disparity
between
the
population
and
the
proportion
and
of
the
racial
make-up
of
the
panel.
an
influx
may
be
drawn
that
there
has
been
systematic
racial
discrimination,
and
because
there
is
hardly
any
other
explanation.
i
gather
the
cases
say
that
--
and
if
there
some
other
explanations
the
state
ought
to
prove
it,
but
now
the
state
says
that
normal
inference
of
systematic
racial
discrimination
should
not
necessarily
be
drawn
because
the
it
just
does
not
make
sense,
this
is
the
argument
anyway,
that
the
people
who
choose
juries
would
systematically
discriminate
against
their
own
race.
now,
the
inference
out
of
the
cases
rests
in
human
experience
and
in
logic
and
common
sense,
and
the
state
is
saying
that
that
inference
should
not
be
drawn
when
the
great
majority
of
the
population
is,
well,
when
the
discrimination
is
not
against
the
minority.
