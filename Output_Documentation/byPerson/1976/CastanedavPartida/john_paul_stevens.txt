mr.
hall,
isnâ€™t
it
probable
that
each
of
those
cases,
the
total
population
and
the
total
number
of
citizens
were
the
same,
whereas
here
there
is
a
probability,
it's
a
border
county,
and
there
is
a
probability
of
a
large
alien
population?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
there
something
in
the
record
that
tends
to
support
that
inquiry?
you
say
there
is
10,000
to
28,000
foreign-born
persons.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
district
judge
sitting
in
that
district
could
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
large
alien
population
in
the
border
community?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
say
speculation,
is
--
your
opponent
says
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
22,000
to
28,000
foreign
born
persons
reside
in
the
district.
is
that
evidence
or
speculation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
