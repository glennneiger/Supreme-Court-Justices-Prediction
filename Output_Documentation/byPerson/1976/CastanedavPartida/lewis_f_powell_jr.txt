justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
every
previous
grand
jury
discrimination
case
reaching
this
court,
the
situation
has
involved
a
governing
majority
in
the
community
with
the
resulting
power
over
the
selection
of
grand
juries
by
an
anglo-american
electorate,
an
anglo
official.
in
these
prior
cases,
we
have
sustained
claims
of
grand
jury
discrimination
against
politically
powerless
minorities
where
they
were
totally
excluded
from
or
limited
only
to
a
token
participation
on
grand
juries.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
all
together
different.
here,
we
have
a
mexican-american
defendant,
duly
convicted
by
a
petty
jury,
who
claimed
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
him,
but
the
defendant
was
not
a
member
of
a
minority
group.
he
was
indicted
and
convicted
in
hidalgo
county,
texas,
a
community
in
which
79%
of
the
population
and
a
majority
of
their
elected
officials
also
are
mexican-american.
the
key
actors
in
this
drama
were
not
anglos.
they
were
mexican-americans,
the
judge
who
appointed
the
jury
commissioners
and
who
later
presided
over
the
trial.
three
our
of
five
jury
commissioners,
five
of
the
12
grand
jurors
who
returned
the
indictment,
seven
of
the
12
petty
jurors
who
found
respondent
guilty,
and
the
majority
of
the
persons
on
the
grand
jury
list
in
the
year
of
respondent's
indictment,
all
were
mexican-american.
i
emphasize
that
a
majority
of
the
grand
jury
commissioners,
who
under
texas
law,
select
the
grand
jurors
were
mexican-americans.
thus,
mexican-americans
controlled
both
the
selection
of
the
grand
jurors
and
the
entire
political
process.
in
these
circumstances,
the
rational
inferences
from
the
most
basic
facts
in
a
democratic
society
render
wholly
improbable,
respondent's
claim
of
purposeful
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
grand
jurors.
there
is,
for
me,
a
sense
of
extraordinary
unreality
when
justices
here
in
washington
decide
that
mexican-americans,
who
control
the
levers
of
power
in
this
remote
border
community,
are
manipulating
those
levers
to
discriminate
against
their
fellow
mexican-americans.
in
contrast,
the
judges,
not
in
washington
but
those
on
the
scene,
the
state
judges
who
appointed
the
jury
commissioners,
the
state
judge
who
presided
over
respondent's
trial
and
the
united
states
district
judge,
both
mexican-americans,
familiar
with
the
community
perceived
not
basis
for
respondent's
claim
of
invidious
discrimination.
a
quash
decision
today
releases
one
mexican-american
defendant
whose
guilt
determined
by
a
jury
that
included
its
seven
mexican-americans
is
not
questioned
in
this
case,
but
i
am
not
concerned
particularly
by
the
result
of
this
case.
i
am
concerned
by
the
holding
that
statistical
disproportionality
is
a
law
insufficient
to
invalidate
indictments
and
subsequent
convictions,
the
implications
of
this
unprecedented
holding
may
be
far
reaching
indeed.
