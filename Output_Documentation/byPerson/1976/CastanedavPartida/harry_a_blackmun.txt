justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
it
concerns
the
“key
man”
system
employed
in
the
state
of
texas
for
the
selection
of
grand
juries.
jury
commissioners
are
appointed
by
the
state
district
judge
and
then
the
judge
proceeds
to
test
their
qualifications.
among
other
things,
the
grand
jurors
must
be
of
sound
mind
and
good
moral
character
and
be
literate,
have
no
prior
felony
conviction
and
be
under
no
pending
indictment
or
other
accusation.
the
respondent,
mr.
partida,
was
convicted
of
a
crime
in
a
texas
state
court
and
he
claimed
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
him.
after
he
had
exhausted
his
state
remedies,
he
filed
a
habeas
petition
in
the
federal
court
based
upon
alleged
gross
under
representation
of
mexican-americans
in
the
county
grand
juries.
the
federal
court
concluded
that
partida
indeed
have
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
invidious
discrimination.
it
also
concluded,
however,
that
the
case
was
a
weak
one
as
it
described
it
and
concluded
that
its
doubts
about
the
reliability
of
population
and
grand
jury
statistics,
coupled
with
the
thought
that
mexican-americans
constituted
a
governing
majority
in
the
county,
caused
it
further
to
determine
that
the
prima
facie
case
had
been
rebutted
and
the
petition
therefore
was
dismissed.
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
holding
that
the
state
had
failed
to
rebut
the
prima
facie
case.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
review
at
some
length
the
statistical
and
other
evidence
that
shows
the
county
population
to
be
79%
mexican-american,
or
if
one
would
exclude
those
under
25
and
those
who
are
illiterate
as
still
65%
mexican-american.
but
at
over
an
11-year
period,
only
39%
of
those
summoned
for
grand
jury
service
were
mexican-american.
we
conclude,
that
the
proof
offered
by
the
respondent,
did
demonstrate
a
prima
facie
case
and
thus,
we
agree
with
both
courts
below
and
that
the
state,
however,
failed
to
rebut
this
by
competent
evidence.
all
the
state
offered
by
way
evidence
was
the
testimony
of
the
state
district
judge
dealing
with
the
selection
of
the
commissioners
and
the
instructions
he
had
given
them.
the
court
did
not
call
the
jury
commissioners
to
testify.
without
evidence
about
the
method
by
which
the
commissioners
determine
the
qualifications
for
grand
jurors,
no
inference
explaining
a
significant
disparity
can
be
drawn
from
the
statistics
about
the
population
as
a
whole.
we
also
hold
that
the
district
court's
so-called
governing
majority
theory
did
not
dispel
the
presumption
of
an
intentional
discrimination.
we
do
not
resume,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
human
beings
of
one
definable
group
will
not
discriminate
against
other
members
of
that
group
and
we
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
i
should
point
out
that
the
court
is
closely
divided
in
this
case.
joining
the
opinion
are
justices
brennan,
white,
marshall
and
stevens.
i
am
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
marshall,
while
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court,
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
mr.
justice
powell
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
short
dissenting
statement
and
mr.
justice
powell
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
also
filed
an
opinion
in
dissent.
