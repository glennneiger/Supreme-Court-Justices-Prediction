mr.
david
g.
hall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
single
most
salient
and
important
fact
in
this
case,
is
hidalgo
county
itself
and
the
county’s
demography.
it
is
79.2%
mexican-american
that
is
almost
80%.
now,
it
is
true
that
we
are
talking
about
total
population
here,
rather
that
some
of
the
cases
that
have
been
presented
in
this
case
that
talked
about
in
terms
of
adult
population.
none
of
the
cases
in
this
court
that
i
am
aware
of,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
inquiry
to
my
friend
mr.
beery,
have
talked
about
it
in
terms
of
citizens
as
being
the
norm
that
by
which
we
compare.
mr.
david
g.
hall
i
am
not
aware
of
any
state
that
does
not
have
a
requirement
of
citizenship
for
jury
service.
mr.
david
g.
hall
it
has
not
been
discussed
in
any
case,
either
of
this
one
and,
by
the,
it
hasn’t
t
been
alleged
by
the
state
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
david
g.
hall
the
question
your
honor,
it
comes
down
to
who
bears
the
burden
of
proving
that,
and
i
think
the
clear
again
board
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
particularly
of
the
fifth
circuit
as
well,
are
to
the
effect
that
the
state
bears
that
burden
as
a
matter
of
explanation
for
the
disparity.
if
the
state
is
going
to
say,
“well,
yes
this
40%
of
disparity
does
exists.”
mr.
david
g.
hall
well,
on
at
least
four
occasions
in
this
court,
in
avery
v.
georgia.
mr.
david
g.
hall
that
is
correct.
the
disparity
between
the
population
and
the
jury
pool
is
based
upon
the
total
population
in
avery,
turner,
carter
and
eubanks.
mr.
david
g.
hall
there
is
a
possibility
that
there
is
a
larger
alien
--
disproportion
of
alien
population.
mr.
david
g.
hall
mr.
justice
stevens,
it
really
comes
down
at
this
point
on
the
basis
of
the
record
to
pure
speculation
and
the
question
throughout
on
these
kinds
of
issues,
we
can
talk
about
the
number
of
illegal
aliens
in
the
population,
number
of
legal
aliens,
felons,
illiterates,
persons
of
unsound
mind,
those
persons
who
lacking
good
moral
character.
all
those
of
which
are
qualifications
for
jury
service,
the
question
still
comes
down
to
who
bears
the
burden
of
producing
that
information,
and
on
this.
mr.
david
g.
hall
no,
i
do
not
believe
he
could,
because
what
we
are
talking
about
are
--
the
case
of
the
prisoner
here
was
a
statistical
case.
it
is
our
opinion
that
the
statistical
case
can
really
only
be
rebutted
effectively
with
the
use
of
statistics
and
hard
information.
what
the
state
has
consistently
relied
on
here
is
pure
conjecture
and
speculation.
there
is
some
possibility
in
the
record
that
larger
numbers
of
mexican-americans
are
disqualified
on
the
basis
of
alienage
or
education
or
whatever
it
may
be,
but
it
is
nothing
more
than
just
speculation,
and
the
question
still
comes
down.
mr.
david
g.
hall
that,
whether
those
persons
are
us
citizens
by
birth,
by
virtue
of
having
one
parent
who
is
an
american
citizen,
whether
they
are
naturalized
individuals,
none
of
that
information
is
in
the
record.
mr.
david
g.
hall
your
honor,
once
again,
the
thrust
of
our
proof
was
the
total
population
by
which
to
compare
and
then
what’s
the
disparity
with
that
that
actually
appears
on
the
jury’s
list
elected
by
the
commissioner
and
we
did
not
get
into
the
question
of...
mr.
david
g.
hall
if
i
were
trying
the
case
on
behalf
of
the
state,
yes
your
honor,
i
would
certainly
want
to
go
looking
for
those
kinds
of
statistics,
to
try
to
explain
that
disparity.
mr.
david
g.
hall
your
honor,
on
understanding
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
on
whitus,
turner,
coleman,
avery,
paten
and
hill,
indicates
the
contrary
that
when
it
comes
to
--
if
the
state
is
going
to
rely
upon
a
suggestion
that
the
victims
of
discrimination
are
victims
solely
because
they
lack
the
qualifications
for
service,
then
it
is
up
to
them
to
prove
that
fact.
mr.
david
g.
hall
well,
of
course
there
are
number
of
examples
where
we
have
seen
discrimination
against
a
majority
and
the
courts
have
really
not
talked.
this
court
has
not
talked
about,
nor
as
of
any
other,
that
i
am
aware
of,
talked
about
the
focused
attention
upon
who
is
doing
the
discriminating.
the
thrust
of
your
question,
mr.
justice
white,
is
perfectly
well
taken.
i
think
all
of
us,
--
this
case
would
have
been
an
easy
case
in
1969,
before
judge
alamia
took
the
bench.
this
disparity,
is
grotesque
disparity
has
been
presented
to
this
court.
all
the
state
is
relying
upon
other
that
the
speculation
in
the
record,
we
talked
about
as
far
as
alienage
and
education
is
concerned,
is
what
--
and
i
think
what
they
would
like
for
this
court
to
do
is
to
erect
an
ir-rebuttable
presumption
that
a
black
cannot
discriminate
against
a
black,
than
a
mexican-american
judge,
and
mexican-american.
mr.
david
g.
hall
not
necessarily,
we
can…
mr.
david
g.
hall
well,
first
of
all
we
have
got
the
texas
system
itself,
which
is
a
totally
subjective
system.
it's
totally
part
of
the
same
argument,
so
that
is
part
of
argument
in
the
cases
on
the
books,
go
to
justify
the
inferences,
that
it
is
a,
this
disparity
--
there
is
this
disparity
and
there
is
this
opportunity
for
discrimination.
mr.
david
g.
hall
well,
if
you
remove
from
us
the
ability
to
rely
upon
a
statistical
case,
and
you
remove
from
us
the
ability
to
rely
in
part
proof
--
as
in
such
cases
as
turner,
for
example,
which
talks
about
the
subjective,
that
the
discrimination
occurs
at
that
point
when
subjective
discretion
is
permitted.
mr.
david
g.
hall
without
being
articulate
in
the
opinions,
that
seems
to
be
the
case,
i
would
assume
that
is
the
case.
mr.
david
g.
hall
not
entirely,
and
we
are
talking
about...
mr.
david
g.
hall
well,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
about
that
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
about
the
number
in
1972
or
1971,
when
this
incident
occurred,
as
to
the
number
of
registered
voters,
and
whether
they
were
mexican-american
majority
or
minority
or
the
members
of
the
mexican
officer
holders,
nothing
in
the
record
about
that,
what
kind
of
offices
they
have.
what
case
really
boils
down
to
is
with
where
do
we
place
the
burden
of
proof
in
this
kind
of
a
situation,
as
the
burden
falls
upon
the
single
defendant
and
the
single
criminal
action
to
prove
that
his
class,
his
ethnic
group,
is
as
qualified
or
more
qualified
than
the
rest
of
the
population
in
the
community,
then
you
settled
him
with
an
enormous
burden
that
is
not
shared
by
criminal
defendants
in
other
kinds
of
jurisdictions.
mr.
david
g.
hall
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
g.
hall
that
is
correct
and
as
we
say
it
based
upon
the
decisions
of
this
court,
admittedly
mr.
justice
white,
in
a
different
kind
of
a
context,
but
applying
the
same
rules
to
hidalgo
country
that
we
applied
at
the
rest
of
the
nation,
that
a
prima
facie
case
is
made
by
showing
some
kind
of
a
disparity,
a
significant
disparity.
mr.
david
g.
hall
we
are
not
entitled
proportional
representation
under
swain,
of
course.
mr.
david
g.
hall
i
think
we
are
entitled
to
a
fair
cross-section.
mr.
david
g.
hall
of
course,
peter’s
and
taylor,
the
two
most
recent
opinions.
mr.
david
g.
hall
of
course,
mr.
justice
marshall
wrote
one…
mr.
david
g.
hall
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
g.
hall
on
grand
juries,
yes.
now,
of
course,
i
believe
in
your
opinion
in
peter’s,
excuse
me
in
taylor,
that
you
cited
the
language,
mr.
justice
marshall
used
in
peter’s.
mr.
david
g.
hall
was
the
sixth
amendment
petit
jury
case.
mr.
david
g.
hall
but,
at
that
what
focus
--
the
interesting
focus
of
both
peter’s
and
taylor’s
are
upon
not
the
discrimination,
like
in
taylor,
it
was
difficult
to
say
that
there
was
intentional
discrimination
because
it
was
the
women
who
were
refusing
to
opt
in
to
the
system
that
resulted
in
a
jury
pool,
that
was
not
representative
of
a
cross-section
of
the
community.
mr.
david
g.
hall
that
is
correct,
and
i
do
not
want
to
confuse
the
two.
i
understand
the
distinction,
but
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
seems
to
be
at
least
in
those
two
cases,
a
renewed
emphasis
upon
the
defendant’s
right
to
a
jury
that
is
representative
of
his
community,
at
least
in
the
sixth
amendment
petit
jury
situation.
mr.
david
g.
hall
your
honor,
the
79.2%
figure
is
total
population
and
i
relied
upon
avery,
turner,
carter
and
eubanks
among
other
decisions
in
a
lower
and
the
fifth
circuit,
to
support
the
proposition
that
we
are
entitled
to
use
--
let
me
kind
of
back-off
of
that
a
second.
if
the
disparity
here
were
less,
somewhere
in
the
norm
of,
in
the
order
of
say
15%
to
20%,
i
certainly
would
have
gone
off
to
attempt
to
show
that
that
could
not
possibly
been
based
upon
alienage,
literacy
or
the
others.
but
here
we
have
a
40%
disparity,
forty-plus.
in
1939
this
court
decided
pierre
versus
louisiana,
there
was
a
49%
disparity
there,
and
that
was
a
total
exclusion
case.
in
arnold
in
1964
there
was
one
44.47%.
there
are
43
other
written
opinions
of
this
court
on
this
subject,
and
none
reached
a
disparity
any
higher
than
this
one,
with
the
exception
of
the
two
i
just
mentioned.
when
you
have
got
those
kinds
of
disparities,
it
is
our
argument
that
there
is
a
lot
of
room
there
for
conjecture
about
alienage
and
literacy,
and
sound
mind
and
good
moral
character
and
the
other
statutory
qualifications.
but
the
burden
properly
has
to
be
placed
upon
the
state
to
explain.
mr.
david
g.
hall
yes,
you’re
honor.
mr.
david
g.
hall
if
they
can
make
that
showing,
now
of
course,
they
have
the
testimony
of
judge
alamia
who
had
been
empanelling
the
juries
for
two–and-half
year
period.
one
person
had
ever
disqualified
himself
for
language,
he
was
not
a
spanish
speaker,
he
was
a
polish
descent,
who
does
not
speak
english,
he
was
an
anglo
in
other
words.
that
is
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
about
the
language.
mr.
david
g.
hall
yes,
you’re
honor,
i
am
including
all
of
those
on
the
subject.
mr.
david
g.
hall
at
hernandez
is
the
exception.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
g.
hall
at
hernandez,
1954.
mr.
david
g.
hall
hernandez
was
11.1%
in
jackson
county
texas
in
1952
or
1953,
but
there
were
no
mexican-americans
ever
having
appeared
on,
it
was
a
total
exclusion.
mr.
david
g.
hall
right.
mr.
david
g.
hall
that
is
correct
your
honor,
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time
after
the
trial
on
a
motion
for
new
trial,
and
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
ignored
the
state’s
arguments
about
waiver
and
decided
the
case
on
the
merits,
coleman
v.
alabama,
ervin
v.
diode.
there
are
number
of
decisions
of
this
court
indicating
to
the
lower
courts
and
then
also
of
this
court,
of
course,
it
will
reach
the
merits
in
that
kind
of
a
circumstance.
mr.
david
g.
hall
your
honor,
the
record
is
essentially
the
same
record
that
was
made
in
the
state
court.
now,
what
we
did
was
introduce
that
entire
record
in
the...
mr.
david
g.
hall
it
was
raised
on
a
motion
for
new
trial.
the
state
court
permitted
me
to
make
the
showing
of
this
on
motion
for
new
trial.
mr.
david
g.
hall
no,
all
they
are
relying
solely
on
figures
that
we
put
into
the
record.
mr.
david
g.
hall
the
habeas
petitioner’s
figures,
the
respondents’
figures
here.
mr.
david
g.
hall
this
was
a
suggestion,
i
suppose
it
raised
in
the
federal
district
courts.
mr.
david
g.
hall
judge
garza
raised
that
question,
he
was
saying
that
this
is
really
not,
perhaps
is
not
ethnic
or
national
origin
discrimination,
but
rather
it
is
class
or
status.
mr.
david
g.
hall
if
that
were
the
fact,
if
that
is
what
it
were,
then
we
would
have
certainly
the
disproportional
impact
upon
mexican-americans,
given
economic
status
of
mexican-americans
in
the
county,
but
then
it
would
raise
this
whole
specter
of
the
cross-section
again
and...
mr.
david
g.
hall
correct.
in
closing,
the
only
statement
i
would
like,
the
further
statement
i
would
like
to
make
to
the
court
is
that
we
are
talking
about
an
individual’s
opportunity
to
be
tried
before
a
jury
of
his
or
her
peers.
mr.
david
g.
hall
yes,
your
honor,
indicted.
of
course,
on
that
point
in
alexander
v.
louisiana,
i
believe
mr.
justice
white,
in
a
footnote
points
out
that
the
standards
and
principles
for
judging
the
kinds
of
claims
are
essentially
the
same.
i
believe
it
was
court
footnote,
that's
correct.
mr.
david
g.
hall
that
was
not
my
understanding
of
it,
now
the
state
has
already
had
two
opportunities
for
hearing.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
this
case
was
first
taken
into
the
federal
court
on
the
habeas
corpus,
the
state
was
advised
by
judge
garza
in
a
memorandum
order,
that
the
petitioner
had
shown
sufficient
evidence
to
shift
the
burden
of
proof
to
them
and
that
they
were
expecting
to
come
forward
with
evidence,
and
this
they
have
totally
failed
too.
now,
on
two
occasions
they
have
refused
to
put
in
any
kind
of
evidence
other
than
the
testimony
of
the
judge.
mr.
david
g.
hall
i
presume,
the
way
i
understood
that,
i
presume
what
they
were
suggesting
is
that
it
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
the
purpose
of
issuing
an
order
requiring
a
trial,
a
re-indictment
or
retrial
within
90
days.
that
is
my
understanding
of
it.
mr.
david
g.
hall
thank
you.
