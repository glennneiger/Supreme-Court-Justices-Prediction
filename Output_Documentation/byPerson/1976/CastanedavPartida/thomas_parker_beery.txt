mr.
thomas
parker
beery
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioner
here
in
sheriff
claudio
castaneda
of
the
hidalgo
county
texas.
in
march
of
1972,
state
district
judge
hose
alamia,
a
mexican-american
residing
on
ninety-second
district
court
of
hidalgo
county
texas,
selected
five
persons
to
serve
as
grand
jury
commissioners
for
that
term
of
court.
three
of
those
five
persons
were
of
mexican-american
or
spanish-american
dissent.
those
five
commissioners
in
turn
selected
20
persons
to
serve
as
potential
grand
jurors.
this
list
of
20
persons
is
known
in
texas
as
the
grand
jury
panel
or
list,
or
pool.
but
the
person
that
summoned
those
20
persons
to
open
court
to
be
in
panel
later
by
judge
alamia
is
the
petitioner
herein,
sheriff
claudio
castaneda.
ten
out
of
the
20
persons
chosen
by
the
grand
jury
commissioners
of
the
mexican-american,
ten
were
anglo-american.
three
mexican-americans
that
were
to
be
served
by
sheriff
castaneda,
could
not
be
located.
one
was
listed
on
the
return
of
the
settlements
as
being
out
of
state.
two
anglo-americans,
shown
by
the
record,
were
excused
by
the
court
prior
to
the
formal
empanelment
of
march
16,
1972.
on
march
16th,
in
1972,
judge
alamia
empanelled
the
grand
jury
panel
in
open
court.
one
of
the
mexican-american
at
that
time
was
absent
for
the
proceedings.
13
persons
showed
up,
five
mexican-americans
have
been
absent,
out
of
state
or
could
not
be
found
by
sheriff
castaneda.
two
anglo-americans
had
already
been
excused
by
the
court
leaving
13
persons
to
be
in
panel.
judge
alamia
at
that
time
only
needing
12
persons
to
serve
on
the
grand
jury
had
his
option
excusing
one
person
for
some
sort
of
an
emergency
excuse.
one
man
by
the
name
of
mr.
faulkner,
an
anglo-american,
has
to
be
excused
because
he
had
a
business
over
mcallen,
texas,
having
to
do
with
a
drugstore.
one
mexican-american
by
the
name
of
mr.
cavio(ph)
seemed
to
have
more
pressing
matter,
he
had
a
father
that
was
due
for
heart
surgery
in
houston
the
next
week
and
judge
alamia
after
considering
both
excuses,
excused
the
anglo-american,
mr.
faulkner,
and
kept
mr.
cavio
on
the
grand
jury.
that
grand
jury
also,
judge
alamia,
that
same
day
on
march
16th
appointed
a
mexican-american
that's
formed
the
grand
jury.
the
next
day
on
march
17th,
1972,
that
particular
grand
jury
consisting
of
five
mexican-americans
and
seven
anglo-americans
indicted
the
respondent
herein
for
the
offense
of
burglary
of
a
private
residence
at
night
with
intent
to
commit
rape.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
at
least
twelve,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
yes
sir,
nine,
at
least
nine.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
no,
i
do
not
challenge
the
figures
at
all.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
i
was
relying
on
the
exhibits
that
were
introduced
by
the
respondent
back
in
1973,
the
motion
for
new
trial.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
not
at
that
time,
your
honor.
to
be
honest
with
the
court
along
those
regards,
the
reason
i
did
not
is
that
there
was
such
a
clear
waiver
in
this
case
of
challenging
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
the
respondent,
and
i
did
not
feel
it's
necessary
to
even
contest
anything
at
the
motions
for
new
trial.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
excuse
me
your
honor,
i
did
not…
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
i
believe
that
if
we
follow
that
case,
i
believe
it
applies
very
directly
to
this
situation.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
that
is
very
unfortunate
that
i
did,
so
i
devoted
over
half
of
my
brief
to
the
waiver
issue
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
there
was
a
case
exactly
on
point
by
the
name
of
valdez
versus
state
found
in
408
southwestern
second,
page
209,
took
care
of
the
situation.
i
have
no
excuse
for
the
courts
of
criminal
appeals
not
get
in
to
the
waiver
situation
before
that.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
judge
alamia
testified
later
at
the
federal
habeas
corpus
before
judge..
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
i
can’t
explain
that,
i
personally
did
not
handle
that
particular
hearing,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
i
understand
it.
probably
should
have
been
done,
but
was
not.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
it
is
a
failure,
but
i
do
not
blame
it.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
i
believe
that
there
are
other
facts
and
figures…
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
i
believe
that
there
are
other
facts
and
figures
within
the
record
that
tend
to
explain
the
disparity
shown
by
the
respondent.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
well,
the
fact
on,
your
honor,
on
page
249
of
the
original
transcript,
introduced
by
the
respondent,
it
has
shown
that
in
hidalgo
county
texas,
that
there
were
some
25,637
males
of
spanish
surnames,
over
25
years
or
older.
some
5,791
completed
no
school
years
whatsoever,
representing,
i
compute
that
to
be
some
23%.
also,
on
the
same
page
249
of
the
original
transcript,
out
of
30,312
females
with
spanish
surnames,
25
years
older
there,
1970
who
lived
in
the
hidalgo
county
area,
7,026
also
completed
no
school
year
whatsoever,
representing
also
23%.
now,
some
of
those
perhaps
could
have
qualified
as
grand
jurors,
but
one
of
the
qualifications
for
being
a
grand
juror
in
the
state
of
texas
is
that
you
should
be
able
to
read
and
write
the
english
language.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
oh,
yes.
it
will
look
good.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
again,
your
honor,
i
did
not
handle
that
particular
hearing.
i
cannot
explain
to
the
court,
why
it
was
not
done.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
that
was
at
the
motion
for
new
trial.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
in
the
state
court
system,
prior
to
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
here
in
judge
reynaldo
garza
court.
at
that
particular
time,
i
was
with
the
district
attorney’s
office
and
left
for
short
while
and
then
came
back
and
did
not
handle
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
over
in
bransa,
in
front
of
judge
garza.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
on
the
waiver
point?
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
well,
the
recent
case
of
francis
versus
henderson
that
came
out
in
may
that
i
was
unaware
of.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
that’s
a
case
where
there
was
a
waiver
in
state
court,
although
we
have
the
problem
in
this
court,
in
this
particular
case
that
the
state
court
jumped
over
the
waiver
issue
and
went
into
the
merits
situation,
which
was
unfortunate.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
i
did
not
cite
francis,
your
honor,
in
that
brief.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
yes
sir,
i
did.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
i
would
rely
on
it
your
honor,
but
i
do
not
include
in
my
brief
because
quite
frankly,
i
was
unaware
of
it,
all
the
time.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
yes,
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
on
that
particular
point.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
that
is
very
true
and
also,
i
believe
around
page
266
of
the
original
transcript,
there
is
shown,
i
believe
the
figure
of
some
22,000
to
28,000
people
in
hidalgo
county
texas
as
of
1970
were
foreign
born.
how
many
of
those
persons
are
citizens
or
have
become
citizens,
no
one
knows?
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
i
would
accept
the
proposition
as
judge
reynaldo
garza
did,
that
it
bears
prima
facie
case.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
i
will
leave
that
to
the
respondent
to
answer
that
particular
question.
i
do
not
know,
i
do
not
know
how
many
there
are
in
the
county,
i
do
not
think
anybody
knows.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
well,
i
think
even
when
we
subtract
the
22,000
to
28,000
persons
that
are
shown
by
those
census
figures
in
1970
to
be
foreign
born,
but
you
are
still
going
to
come
up
with
the
disparity
of
some
sort.
the
disparity
here
was
30%,
of
course
there
was
80%
supposedly
the
population
was
79.2%.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
right,
not
eligible
population.
but
even
subtracting
that
22,000.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
i
have
no
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
no
sir
that
is
the
only
brief
that
i
have
filed.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
no
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
no,
i
was
relying
on
the
federal
cases,
it
said
that
once
the
state
court
has
reached
the
merits
and
jumped
over
the
waiver
issue,
then
federal
courts
would
be
bound
by
that
particular
ruling.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
i
do
not
believe
that
i
can
rely
on
waiver
on
this
court.
i
do
not
think
i
can,
because
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
did
not
write
on
the
waiver
issue,
although
they
referred,
squarely
faced
with
the...
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
alright
sir.
even
assuming
that
a
prima
facie
case
was
made
by
the
respondent,
30%
in
this
particular
case,
we
did
come
back.
the
petitioner
in
the
hearing
on
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
before
judge
reynaldo
garza,
with
the
sworn
testimony
of
judge
alamia,
who
did
testify
that
he
did
not
discriminate
against
mexican-americans
in
choosing
the
grand
jury
commissioners.
also
i
think
if
we
look
at
the
cases
cited
by
the
respondent,
especially
menees
v.
bato
(ph).
we
can
see
really
in
those
cases
that,
especially
in
menees
(ph)
case
over
a
ten
year
period
of
time,
there
had
been
some
150
grand
jury
commissioners
and
none
of
those
had
been
of
the
supposed
excluded
class
mexicans-americans,
but
we
are
all
anglo-americans.
also,
we
would
rely
on
the
decision
of
judge
garza,
reynaldo
garza
that
mexican-american
at
least
on
our
county,
constitute
a
governing
majority.
at
the
time
in
1972,
judge
alamia
was
the
only
the
district
judge
that
handled
criminal
matters,
and
was
only
the
district
judge
that
selected
commissioners
and
in
turn
selected
grand
jurors.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
yes,
that
is
one
of
our
assumptions,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
i
believe
so,
i
believe
it
comports
with
deemed
experience.
at
least
when
they
constitute
a
governing
majority,
it
would
be
unreasonable
on
my
opinion
for
judge
alamia
and
grand
jury
commissioners
to
discriminate
against
other
mexican-americans.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
there
is
some
evidence,
your
honor.
for
example,
the
population
figures
of
some
80%,
there
is
some
support
for
that
particular
proposition.
also,
on
the
hearing
on
amended
motion
for
new
trial
at
the
state
judge
level,
i
believe
it
is
page
216,
that
i
asked
the
respondent
at
that
time,
if
he
knew
of
any
anglo-officials
in
the
county
and
i
believe
his
answer
was,
no.
also,
judge
alamia
at
that
particular
time
asked
him
if
he
knew
if
there
was
any
anglo-officials
at
all
in
the
county,
and
again
his
answer
was,
no.
i
believed
that
judge
alamia
also
asked
him
about
the
sheriff’s
department,
the
police
department,
if
there
was
any
anglo’s
on
those
particular
departments
that
he
knew
of,
he
also
said
no.
also,
i
believe
the
records
shows
that
judge
alamia
is
official
elected
state
district
judge
of
texas,
and
at
that
particular
time,
he
was
the
only
one
that
handled,
by
custom,
criminal
cases
in
our
court.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
oh,
i
believe
it
is
possible,
but
i
would
think
in
that
type
of
situation,
perhaps
it
ought
to
be
on
the
respondent
to
prove
that
it
was
a
result
of
discrimination
by
mexican-americans
against
another
mexican-american,
because
i
just
do
not
believe
that
proposition
compose
with
your
human
experience.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
yes.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
that
mexican-americans
would
not
purposely
and
intentionally
discriminate
against
other
mexican-americans
on
sex
and
grandeur?
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
might
not
be
perfectly
willing
to
see
those
studies,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
well,
at
least
judge
garza
of
the
united
states
district
court
believed
that
to
be
the
case,
your
honor.
that
they
would
not,
especially
elected
officials,
discriminate
against
the
people
who
elect
them.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
well,
the
elected
official
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
no,
no
i
haven’t
said
that
at
all.
i
said
the
elected,
the
elected
officials
there
they
like
judge
alamia
will
not
intentionally
discriminate,
purposely
discriminate
against
the
people
who
elected
them.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
well
as
i
understand
it,
it
is
against
the
whole
system
and
the
judge
is
part
of
the
system
because
he
appoints
the
commissioners.
i
believe
that
is
all
i
have
at
this
particular
time.
i
will
save
some
for
rebuttal,
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
thomas
parker
beery
i
believe
that
is
all,
your
honor,
thank
you.
