unknown
speaker
mr.
beery
is
there
a
fixed-size
for
grand
juries
in
texas?
unknown
speaker
and
is
there
a
minimum
number
that
have
to
vote
for
indictment?
unknown
speaker
they
(inaudible)
the
francis
v.
henderson.
unknown
speaker
case
of
francis
v.
henderson.
unknown
speaker
the
trouble
is
your
statement.
the
appellate
courts
considered
the
merits
as
pointed
out
by
the
federal
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
tried
it
on
the
merits,
didn’t
the
judge
testify
on
the
merits?
unknown
speaker
on
the
merits.
by
the
way,
why
didn’t
the
commissioner
testify?
any
reason
for
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
can
we
ever
find
the
states’
reasons
for
this
if
we
do
not
have
them
to
testify?
unknown
speaker
well
isn’t
that
a
failure
for
the
state
of
texas.
unknown
speaker
and
we
cannot
remedy
it,
can
we?
unknown
speaker
can
we
summarize
it
to
the
reason?
unknown
speaker
what
facts?
unknown
speaker
but
wouldn’t
it
been
much
better
if
the
people
who
picked
the
grand
jury
testified
that
we
did
not
discriminate
at
all?
wouldn’t
it
been
helpful,
wouldn’t
it
look
good
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
do
i
assume
that
the
reason
is
not
in
the
record
because
it
wouldn’t
be
that
testimony?
unknown
speaker
but
why,
why
it
isn’t
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
already
said
you
were
standing
on
the
waiver
proposition.
unknown
speaker
that
was
in
the
state
court
system.
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
supreme
court
case
that
backs
you
up
on
the
waiver
point?
unknown
speaker
yes,
you
only
cited
three
supreme
court
cases
in
your
brief,
all
in
one
paragraph.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
helps
you?
unknown
speaker
where
did
you
cite
francis
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
you
keep
explaining
what
the
other
guy,
the
lawyer
didn’t
try
to
keep,
but
you
did
this
brief,
didn’t
you?
unknown
speaker
would
you
rely
on
francis
now?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
one
thing,
if
the
texas
appellate
courts
has
relied
on
the
waiver,
then
francis
against
henderson
would
say
that
the
federal
habeas
corpus
court
would
have
to
also,
but
here
you
cannot
rely
on
francis
against
henderson,
as
i
think
you
understand,
and
i
have
you
told
you
in
an
answer
to
your
question
because
the
texas
appellate
courts
did
precede
to
the
merits,
that
was
all
pointed
out
by
the
federal
court
of
appeals
here.
unknown
speaker
before
you
proceed,
it
seems
to
been
held
by
the
federal
district
court,
that
prima
facie
case
was
shown,
and
the
district
court
held
at
that
prima
facie
had
been
rebutted
and
the
court
of
appeals,
without
independent
examination
as
i
read
its
opinion,
simply
accepted
the
proposition
that
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
had
been
shown
and
deferred
with
the
district
court
in
its
holding
that
that
prima
facie
case
has
not
been
rebutted.
do
you
accept
the
proposition
that
a
prima
facie
case
has
been
shown?
i
asked,
because
it
seems,
as
i
read
these
statutes
of
texas
that
juror
steven
be
eligible
for
consideration
must
be
citizens,
and
a
prima
facie
case
consisted
not
in
showing
the
percentage
of
citizens,
but
of
showing
the
percentage
of
population,
which
is
quite
subject,
quite
showing,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
so,
do
you
or
do
you
not
accept
the
proposition
that
a
prima
facie
case
has
been
shown?
unknown
speaker
if
jurors
in
order
to
be
even
eligible
for
considerations
have
to
be
citizens
how
do
you
prove
a
prima
facie
case
by
showing
the
proportion
of
residents?
unknown
speaker
then,
why
do
you
tell
me
you
accept
the
finding
that
there
was
a
prima
facie
case?
unknown
speaker
population,
but
not
citizens.
unknown
speaker
why
did
you
not
put
any
of
that
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
why
didn’t
you
put
any
of
what
you
argued
now
in
the
brief?
why
just
save
it,
just
bring
it
on.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
have
you
filed
any
brief
other
than
this?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
here
you
do
not
have
waiver
in
here,
haven’t
you?
unknown
speaker
not
in
here?
unknown
speaker
he
might
be
right
about,
but
i
think
he
can
put
it
in
here,
in
the
brief.
i
mean
this
brief
does
not
help
me
at
all,
i
guess
i
will
just
have
to
read
the
transcript.
unknown
speaker
but
my
understanding
is
you,
you
are
not
relying
on
waiver
in
this
court,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
let
us
move
on
for
merits
then...
unknown
speaker
mr.
berry,
doesn’t
that
assume
that
members
of
an
ethnic
group
will
not
discriminate
against
other
members
of
an
ethnic
group?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
is
a
valid
assumption?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
evidence
in
this
record
that
supports
your
governing
majority
theory?
unknown
speaker
going
back
now
to
my
first
question,
you
think
it
is
not
possible
in
southern
texas,
for
a
state
judge
and
the
commissioners
here
to
practice
discrimination
in
favor
of
an
anglo
minority.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gathered,
you
want
us
to
really
take
judicial
notice
of
that
fact,
when
you
speak
of
human
experience.
unknown
speaker
what
exactly
do
you
want
us
to
take
judicial
notice
of?
unknown
speaker
i
cannot
agree
why
you
got
your
man
to
stay,
that
will
show
you
to
be
contrary.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
cannot
take
judicial
notice
of
something
that
is
in
dispute?
unknown
speaker
i
didn’t
think
you
put
it
in
on
the
like
an
official
point,
i
thought
you
put
in
on
nationality?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
that
there
is
not
a
single
spanish-speaking
person
in
the
country
who
would
do
harm
to
another
spanish
speaking
person?
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
the
charge
was
against
the
judge,
i
thought
it
was
against
the
commissioner?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
evidence
in
those
other
cases
that
the
state
had
a
requirement
of
citizenship
for
grand
jury
service?
unknown
speaker
was
that
discussed
in
any
of
the
other
cases?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
there
is
a
requirement
of
citizenship,
wouldn’t
the
most
logical
statistical
approach
be
in
terms
of
citizens?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
question
is
what
do
you
have
to
show
in
order
to
shift
the
burden
to
the
state,
and
what
i
am
saying
is
would
not
it
the
most
logical
type
of
statistics
for
your
prima
facie
case
be
related
to
citizenship
rather
than
just
residents.
unknown
speaker
well,
and
you
have
said
that
none
of
those
refer
to
a
requirement
of
citizenship,
have
you
not?
unknown
speaker
did
your
proof
show
anything
about
what
percentage
were
literate,
that
is
could
qualify
for
jury
service?
unknown
speaker
but
don’t
you
think
that
is
quite
important?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
obligation
to
show
anything
about
the
literacy
question
to
the
total
spanish-surname
people?
unknown
speaker
no,
they
are
just
going
to
say
that
you
wouldn’t
make
out
your
prima
facie
case
based
on
just
the
statistics
you’ve
presented,
that
just
a
disparity
would
not
prove
your
case.
well,
that's
all
the
state
suggested,
because
all
you
have
got
is
the
disparity.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
else
do
you
have?
unknown
speaker
but
who
won
the
cases
normally
where
the
people
choosing
the
jury?
historically
the
cases
and
the
key-man
system,
there
were
white
jury
commissioners
choosing
juries.
unknown
speaker
the
power
structure
was
involved,
here
the
power
structure
is
just
the
reverse,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
not
entirely
but
we
are
talking
at
the
reverse
of
the
one
justice
white
was
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
in
the
record,
who
owns
the
property
down
there?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hall
you
concede,
as
i
understand
it,
that
you
as
an
individual
defendant
have
the
burden
of
making
a
prima
facie
case.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
the
question
here
then
in
the
case
like
this,
what
is
a
prima
facie
case?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
you
are
entitled
to
in
a
grand
jury?
unknown
speaker
you
think
you
are
entitled
to
a
fair
cross-section?
unknown
speaker
where
did
you
get
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course
peter’s
--
can
you
cite
any
majority
opinions
indicating
on
a
constitutional
basis
that
there
is
a
right
to
a
fair
cross-section?
unknown
speaker
you
have
got
a
right
to
a
jury
that’s
picked
without
racial
discrimination.
that
is
what’s
you
have
got
a
right
to.
unknown
speaker
that
is
as
far
as
the
case
as
the
cases
goes
so
far
on
grand
jury,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
but
taylor
was
the
--
unknown
speaker
that
is
correct,
the
petit
jury.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that
--
making
a
prima
facie
case
about
--
of
what
you
have
a
right
to
as
a
cross-section
is
one
thing
and
making
a
prima
facie
case
what
you
have
got
a
right
to
is
to
be
free
from
racial
discrimination,
is
something
else
again.
unknown
speaker
i
believe,
the
court
of
appeals
has
already
disagreed
with
judge
garza’s
determination
but
perhaps
not
open
to
re-examination
in
many
respects,
but
you
are
showing
in
the
case,
dependent
on
an
assumption
that
all
of
the
spanish-surname
people
or
citizens
and
that
they
were
all
literate,
did
it
not?
that
is
where
you
get
your
79.2%
figure.
unknown
speaker
you
think
your
79.2%
shifted
the
burden
to
the
state,
and
the
state
should
then
have
come
in
and
demonstrated
in
some
ways
statistically
that
half
of
them
could
not
speak
english
and
40%
of
them
were
not
citizens
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
if
that,
if
they
could
make
that
showing.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hall,
when
you
speak
of
the
43
cases
from
this
court,
are
you
lumping
together
petit
jury
and
grand
jury
cases?
unknown
speaker
and
they
are
all
but
all,
but
one
involved
the
alleged
discrimination
against
negros?
unknown
speaker
one
exception.
unknown
speaker
and,
what
were
the
figures
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
oh,
it
was
a
total
exclusion
case,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hall,
is
there
any
question
about
this
issue
being
here,
am
i
correct
in
my
impression,
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time
and
they
appealed
in
the
texas
state
court?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hall,
your
opponent
made
reference
to
the
number
of
persons,
mexican-americans,
who
had
no
schoolings.
where
does
that
come
in
the
records,
in
the
habeas
corpus
hearing?
unknown
speaker
how
was
that
opinion
involved
in
the
state’s
court
if
this
issue
wasn’t
raised
at
the
trial
level,
that
is
what
puzzled
me.
unknown
speaker
and,
in
their
response
to
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
they
put
in
these
figures?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
unknown
speaker
one
other
question
mr.
hall,
that
troubles
me.
supposing
that
there
were
full
trial
on
the
evidences
shown
that
the
jury
commissioners
had
actually
been
motivated
by
a
desire
to
get
their
social
peers
on
the
grand
jury,
people
of
same
economic
status,
was
that
a
state
decline?
unknown
speaker
judge
garza
raised
that.
unknown
speaker
in
which
way
would
that
cut,
if
that
was
the
fact?
unknown
speaker
whether
we
cut
one
way
to
the
petit
jury,
it
would
not
hurt
you
in
the
petit
jury,
it
would
help
you.
but,
on
the
grand
jury,
it
is
a
problem.
unknown
speaker
indicted?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hall,
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question.
as
i
read
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion,
if
the
case
is
remanded
for
a
further
hearing,
and
there
will
be
the
state
given
an
opportunity
to
put
it
any
other
evidence,
is
that
your
reading,
or
do
you
think
the
case
is
over?
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
that
goes
the
question
whether
they
should
get
another
hearing.
my
question
is
how
do
you
interpret
the
mandate
that
the
court
ends
up
by
saying
it
remanded
for
further
proceedings,
rather
than
just
simply
reversing
and
directing
the
writ
issue.
