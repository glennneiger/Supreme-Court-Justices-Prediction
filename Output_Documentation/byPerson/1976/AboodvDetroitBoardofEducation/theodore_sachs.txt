mr.
theodore
sachs
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
in
the
remaining
few
minutes
before
the
recess
it
would
be
profitable
to
indicate
what
this
case
does
not
involve.
clearly,
i
would
suggest
on
state
of
the
record
and
as
the
case
comes
before
the
court,
there
is
not
a
political
expenditures
issue
dealing
with
the
question
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked.
the
lower
court
in
fact
decided
favorably
to
the
contention
of
appellants
as
to
the
use
of
agency
shop
monies
for
political
purposes
and
made
clear
that
where
such
money
is
to
be
expended.
over
their
objection,
they
would
indeed
have
a
cause
of
action.
the
complaint
was
dismissed
in
the
instant
case
because
in
fact
they
had
never
made
any
appropriate
protest
on
any
timely
fashion.
it
should
be
recalled
if
the
court
please,
that
this
complaint
that
is
the
initial
complaint
in
warczak
of
which
abood
is
virtually
a
carbon,
was
filed
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
act.
in
that
circumstance,
it
was
virtually
identical
to
the
hanson
case.
not
withstanding
which,
the
plaintiffs
alleged
although
not
one
penny
had
been
collected
from
anyone,
nor
of
course
therefore,
nor
have
one
penny
been
expended
that
the
union
was
somehow
using
the
money
for
political
purposes
unspecified
as
to
which
the
plaintiffs
objected
and
they
sought
on
that
account
not
some
remedy,
discrete
and
referable
to
expenditures
or
alleged
expenditures
of
a
political
nature,
but
they
sought
as
in
hanson
to
avoid
the
obligation
of
the
agency
shop
clause
entirely.
they
sought
no
relief
whatsoever
as
to
the
claimed
expenditures
and
they
did
not
itemize
or
specify
any
specific
compliant
if
any
which
they
had.
they
incanted
their
phrasing
which
presumably
was
intended
to
invoke
a
remedy
which
would
set
aside
the
clause
entirely.
moreover
during
the
entire
pendency
of
the
litigation,
they
have
been
excused
from
enforcement
of
the
clause.
there
has
been
no
discharge
of
any
plaintiff
appellant.
there
has
been
no
other
enforcement.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
then
that
the
lower
court
after
first
saying
that
the
statute
did
not
admit,
as
this
court
had
interpreted
the
railway
labor
act
within
it,
of
the
possibility
of
expenditure
or
non-expenditure
over
objections
of
dissenters.
after
saying
that
could
present
a
constitutional
dilemma,
avoided
the
problem
entirely
by
then
agreeing
with
the
contention
of
the
plaintiffs
and
saying
yes
were
that
to
happen,
there
would
indeed
be
a
remedy.
we
did
not
cross
appeal
on
that
ruling.
that
is
the
fashion
in
which
the
matter
comes
before
the
court
in
addition
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief.
the
union
complied
with….
mr.
theodore
sachs
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
think
under
the
holding
of
the
court,
there
would
have
to
be
a
specific
objection
just
as
this
court
stated
in
the
lathrop
case
in
the
context
of
constitutional
adjudication,
such
a
requirement
would
be
necessary,
at
least
it
was
necessary
in
the
context
of
the
complaint
there,
but
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
is
academic
now
because
the
union
has
adopted
the
remedial
process
which
was
recommended
by
this
court
in
the
allen
case
as
a
means
of
facilitating
ready
restitution
of
the
proportional
payments
in
so
far
as
they
might
be
applied.
mr.
theodore
sachs
no
your
honor.
under
the
internal
remedy,
he
need
not
to
disclose
anything
specific,
leave
going
beyond
the
appellate
decision.
mr.
theodore
sachs
yes
sir,
he
can.
mr.
theodore
sachs
no,
he
would
get
in
accordance
with
the
remedy
of
this
court
and
as
provided
by
the…
mr.
theodore
sachs
he
would
get
a
proportional
refund
in
so
far
as
any
payments
expended
by
the
union
for
political
purposes
are
involved,
has
--
total
expenditure.
mr.
theodore
sachs
we
are
going
to
compute
it
in
the
best
of
good
faith
and
accordance
with
the
suggestion
of
the
allen
case,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
sachs
well
your
honor,
that
would
involve…
mr.
theodore
sachs
your
honor,
under
your
hypothetical
for
40%,
there
will
be
40%
refund.
it
obviously
involves
the
determination
and
as
the
procedure
is
set
out
in
the
appendix,
there
is
a
procedure
for
determination,
there
is
disinterested
review,
there
is
an
opportunity
to
make
precisely
those
formulations
and
there
was
a
deliberate
intent
to
make
the
remedy
as
expensive
and
as
generous
as
possible.
so
there
would
not
be
problems
of
this
sort.
so
the
fact
is
then
i
think
i
can
fairly
state
to
the
court
as
the
matter
comes
before
you,
it
does
not
involve
political
issues
in
the
sense
that
the
court
dealt
with
them
in
the
street
or
dealt
with
them
in
allen.
what
it
seems
to
me
is
presented
by
this
case,
and
the
only
appropriate
question
presented
by
the
case
is
whether
the
rulings
of
this
court
which
seems
to
me
are
quite
clear
in
hanson,
street
and
allen
and
lathrop
are
equally
applicable
or
are
no
less
applicable
in
the
instance
of
a
public
employer
with
respect
to
its
own
employees.
the
case
does
not
involve
contrary
to
suggestions
of
appellants,
a
coerce
membership
of
any
kind
that
that
is
not
the
nature
of
the
obligation.
it
does
not
involve
coerce
effort
of
any
views
or
positions
of
the
union.
it
does
not
involve
ideological
conformity
in
any
fashion.
it
does
not
involve
suppression
of
dissent.
it
does
not
involve
censorship
of
any
dissidents
or
dissenter’s
views.
none
of
those
matters
are
involved
and
as
i
have
already
indicated,
it
does
not
involve,
under
the
posture
of
the
case,
any
of
the
political
expenditures
questions.
mr.
theodore
sachs
it
involves
compulsory…
mr.
theodore
sachs
i
would
respectfully
differ
with
the
term
tribute;
there
is
a
compulsory
obligation
of
financial
support,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
sachs
well,
sometimes
it
has
a
pejorative
sense
than
i
would
think
that
inappropriate
in
this
context,
your
honor.
there
is
no
question
but
there
is
an
obligation
of
financial
support.
mr.
theodore
sachs
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
sachs
thank
you,
your
honor
and
may
it
please
the
court.
appellees
would
suggest
that
an
appropriate
evaluation
of
the
central
issue
which
is
tendered,
necessarily
involves
a
consideration
of
the
general
michigan
labor
code
which
is
involved
here.
michigan,
like
many
other
states
in
extraordinary
number
has
adopted
a
comprehensive
labor
relations
code
which,
in
central
and
significant
aspects,
parallels
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
there
are
numerous
decisions
of
our
own
state
supreme
court
which
have
indicated
as
much
and
have
indicated
that
the
teachings
of
the
federal
act
and
indeed
this
court’s
interpretations
of
that
act
are
persuasive
in
terms
of
determining
the
significance
and
system
of
the
state
act.
part
of
that
system
includes
not
only
the
disciplinary
measures
and
procedures
which
were
before
this
court
in
the
last
term
in
the
crestwood
case
involving
anti-strike
provisions,
but
involved
affirmative
features
dealing
with
a
process
of
collective
bargaining,
and
in
that
respect,
the
michigan
statute
like
the
federal,
like
the
nation
labor
relations
act,
provides
that
where
employees,
in
an
appropriate
bargaining
unit
have
by
democratic
vote
of
majority
of
them,
selected
a
representative.
the
public
employer,
basically
in
the
local
sector,
has
responsibility
to
bargain
in
good
faith
with
respect
to
wages,
hours
and
conditions
of
employment.
the
elements
of
those
concepts
are,
of
course,
entirely
familiar
to
this
court
and
they
are
essentially
of
the
same
meaning
in
the
state
court.
an
aspect
which
is
critical
to
an
understanding
of
the
state
system
and
indeed
of
the
issues
in
this
case,
is
the
proposition
that
the
representative
chosen
under
the
michigan
scheme
is
the
exclusive
representative,
but
the
exclusive
representative
based
upon
majority
rule.
as
such,
as
this
court
has
said
several
times,
the
organization
is
not
a
“private
organization.”
it
is
an
organization
which
is
clothed
with
certain
legislative
authority
in
the
context
of
what
is
involved
here
as
stated
in
steele
and
tunstall,
it
is
an
organization
which
has
the
authority
that
creates
and
extinguishes
certain
rights
from
the
bargaining
unit
generally.
mr.
theodore
sachs
no,
you
are
quite
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
sachs
i
do
not
believe
so
your
honor
and
i
really
cannot
answer
the
court’s
question.
mr.
theodore
sachs
yes
sir
and
that,
of
course,
i
think
is
complementary
to
leaving
such
matters
to
the
states.
presumably
that
was
at
least
the
essential
congressional
intent.
mr.
theodore
sachs
that
is
correct
and
of
course,
the
federal
governmental
employees
have
an
substantial
measure
been
covered
by
various
executive
orders
which
have
provided
similar
bargaining
though
not
precisely
the
same
as
is
involved
here.
the
corollary
it
seems
to
me,
which
is
critical
to
again,
the
understanding
of
what
is
essentially
here
to
the
proposition
of
exclusive
representation,
is
that
there
is
a
duty,
a
fair
representation
on
the
part
of
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
to
all
members
of
the
bargaining
unit.
it
is
perhaps
not
by
accident
that
in
appellant’s
entire
brief,
there
is
not
an
acknowledgement
of
the
concept
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
or
a
citation
of
baker
or
humphrey
or
hines
or
any
of
the
cases
in
which
this
court
has
annunciated
those
familiar
doctrines.
mr.
theodore
sachs
they
are
by
borrowing
by
the
state
courts,
the
michigan
court
--
mr.
theodore
sachs
not
directly,
no
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
sachs
yes
your
honor,
in
a
case
called
lowe
against
the
restaurant
workers,
it
has
essentially
adopted
the
authorities
expressed
by
this
court
and
indeed
in
a
more
recent
case,
by
the
state
court
of
appeals
called
handwerk.
the
court
has
said
that
the
requirements
of
the
state
statute
maybe
perhaps
are
more
strict
than
those
imposed
by
this
court,
and
allow
less
discretion
perhaps
in
terms
of
the
bargaining
agents’
authority
to
discontinue
a
grievance
short
of
arbitration
then
this
court
might
permit.
in
any
event,
the
significance
is
that
there
is
a
very
serious
burden
and
a
very
serious
responsibility
imposed
upon
the
bargaining
agent
to
represent
all,
including
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
there
has
been
no
challenge
in
this
complaint
or
in
this
argument
by
appellants
and
indeed
there
is
a
disclaimer
to
the
concept
of
exclusive
representation.
so
that
is
not
an
issue
before
the
court.
therefore,
i
would
suggest
that
an
appropriate
corollary
of
the
authority
of
the
bargaining
agent,
indeed
this
court
has
said
virtually
there
is
such
a
corollary
in
the
part
of
the
bargaining
agent
to
speak
for
all,
is
to
represent
all
fairly.
therefore
that
means
that
those,
who
whatever
their
exposition
here,
challenge
the
procedure
of
the
statute,
nevertheless
have
called
upon
the
services
of
the
organization
which
is
required
fairly
and
without
any
discrimination
to
render
services
and
no
claim
has
been
made.
mr.
theodore
sachs
in
this
context
your
honor?
mr.
theodore
sachs
well,
under
if
your
honor
is
inquiring
as
to
the
internal
procedure,
the
procedures
established
in
the
first
instance
by
the
union,
subject
to
review
by
a
disinterested
panel.
mr.
theodore
sachs
to
be
appointed
by
the
organization
by
definition
required
to
consist
of
disinterested
citizens.
mr.
theodore
sachs
not
under
the
procedure
constituted
your
honor.
obviously,
if
the
procedure
is
defective
--
mr.
theodore
sachs
now
that
procedure,
your
honor
was
adopted
internally
by
virtue
of
union
resolution,
the
union
thought
following
the
recommendation
--
mr.
theodore
sachs
the
term,
your
honor,
i
think
is
broadly
defined
to
refer
to
political
issues
and
ideological
issues
of
controversial
nature.
the
only
incident
i
would
relate
to
is
collective
barganing.
mr.
theodore
sachs
your
honor
there
has
not
been
an
application
yet.
there
has
not
been
any
instance
for
its
explications
would
come
at
the
conclusion
of
the
calendar
year.
the
intent
certainly
from
the
language
is
to
be
expensed
as
i
stated
earlier
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stevens’
question
to
be
generous
in
that
regard,
so
that
there
would
not
be
any
bona
fide
question
as
to
matters
which
are
appropriately
categorized
as
political
would
be
subject
to
appropriate
refund.
there
is
no
dispute
in
that
regard.
mr.
theodore
sachs
i
would
presume
so,
your
honor.
the
procedure
does
not
say
so,
but
i
would
presume
so.
mr.
theodore
sachs
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
sachs
yes,
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
theodore
sachs
your
honor,
those
matters
are
really
not
tendered
by
this
record
and
i
would
suggest
just
as
this
court
felt
it
appropriate
in
street
and
lathrop
to
indicate
that
there
ought
to
be
an
appropriate
record
to
determine
where
the
appropriate
line
is
to
be
drawn
so
it
ought
to
be
here,
the
rebate
procedure
does
not
speak
to
the
points
which
your
honor
speaks,
nor
do
i
understand
the
lower
court’s
decision
to
do
so,
but
on
the
other
hand,
i
do
not
understand
that
issue
really
too
have
been
tendered
and
seems
not
to
have
been
a
focus
of
the
litigation
at
any
stage.
mr.
theodore
sachs
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
sachs
in
a
technical
sense,
that
is
true,
your
honor
though
in
turn
as
i
must
say
that
there
have
been
a
sequence
of
contracts
which
in
general
tender
--
have
repeated
the
same
thing
because
the
contract
which
was
initially
involved
here
was
a
contract
of
many
years
ago.
mr.
theodore
sachs
well,
i
have
to
say
again
in
fairness
that
that
point
as
such
has
not
been
raised
but
your
honor
as
the
lower
court
--
mr.
theodore
sachs
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
sachs
i
would
think
so,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
not
appropriately
here
but
again
i
do
not
want
to
miss
--
mr.
theodore
sachs
we
did
not
raise
the
point,
but
the
contract
is
long
since
gone
although
there
were
successions
of
later
contracts.
mr.
theodore
sachs
that
is
correct,
and
remanded
in
that
respect
and
that
aspect
of
the
case
has
not
been
brought
here
by
anyone
and
does
not
remotely
involve
any
issues
which
have
been
tendered
here
by
either
side.
mr.
theodore
sachs
i
think
that
might
very
well
be
the
case,
your
honor
and
especially
dicta
which
under
the
view
of
the
appellees’
comports
very
carefully
with
prior
pronouncements
of
this
court.
mr.
theodore
sachs
that
is
correct.
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
theodore
sachs
a
standing
question
your
honor,
and
again
we
have
not
raised
the
point
that
i
understood
justice
stevens
to
cast
in
turns
of
a
jurisdictional
question
and
i
had
not
addressed
that
--
mr.
theodore
sachs
perhaps,
your
honor
but
the
point
is,
again,
none
of
the
parties
have
addressed
it
and
the
court
has
not
addressed
it
as
such
that
what
the
decision
in
this
respect
of
the
lower
court
was,
that
the
statute
did
not
have
retrospective
application.
mr.
theodore
sachs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
sachs
that
is
correct.
mr.
theodore
sachs
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
sachs
your
honor
again
i
have
not
raised
the
issue,
the
only
point
--
mr.
theodore
sachs
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
sachs
we
have
not
raised
a
standing
defense.
mr.
theodore
sachs
after
the
conclusion
of
this
litigation,
presumably
he
would
be.
mr.
theodore
sachs
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
sachs
i
do
not
know
because
in
light
of
the
prior
adjudication
your
honor,
the
state
supreme
court
had
held
that
there
was
not
an
appropriate
statutory
basis
for
the
establishment
of
an
agency
shop
clause,
and
therefore
presumably
there
would
not
had
been
one
and
therefore
there
would
not
have
been
a
firing
clause?
mr.
theodore
sachs
yes
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
sachs
that
is
correct.
mr.
theodore
sachs
that
is
correct.
mr.
theodore
sachs
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
sachs
i
concede
that
the
court
indicated
that
the
statute
did
not
have
retroactive
application.
mr.
theodore
sachs
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
sachs
that
is
correct.
mr.
theodore
sachs
there
was
no
deduction
in
that
respect,
your
honor.
i
have
to
indicate
that
both
parties
sought
rehearing
below
and
then
clarification
as
to
what
the
purpose
of
the
remand
was
with
respect
to
the
retroactive
period
since
there
had
been
no
compulsions,
since
there
had
been
no
collection,
we
could
not
understand
what
the
point
of
it
was.
i,
to
this
date,
do
not
understand
what
issue
remained
on
that
score,
but
it
was
not
framed
in
the
terms
that
your
honor
is
now
questioning
me.
mr.
theodore
sachs
it
is
totally
independent.
mr.
theodore
sachs
as
to
that
past
period
that
would
be
so
subject
to
the
point
that
mr.
justice
white
has
raised
and
that
we
acknowledge
fairly.
mr.
theodore
sachs
that
is
correct.
mr.
theodore
sachs
now,
the
court
said
that
the
contract
and
the
statute
i
think
were
essentially
one
issue.
i
do
not
think
plaintiffs
attempted
to
disassociate
the
contract
from
the
statue.
their
first
amendment
claim
was
that
there
was
statutory
action
involved.
mr.
theodore
sachs
that
clearly
was
the
claim,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
sachs
i
presume
that
is
so,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
sachs
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
detroit
school
board
asked
the
appellants
before
you
is
not
making
a
deduction,
there
has
been
no
deduction
because
there
has
been
a
stay
of
the
enforcement
as
to
all
of
these
appellants.
mr.
theodore
sachs
no,
but
i
want
to
be
clear.
state
in
a
contractual
sense
not
by
virtue
of
any
court
action,
the
contract
itself
provided
that
during
the
pendency
of
litigation
there
would
not
be
enforcement
and
therefore
the
plaintiffs
have
not
been
under
any
compulsion
and
they
have
not
as
i
sought
to
state
in
my
opening
remarks,
did
never
sought
to
challenge
the
expenditures
as
such,
they
sought
to
address
as
plaintiffs
did
in
hanson,
the
collection
as
such.
mr.
theodore
sachs
your
honor,
the
court
i
think
in
its
opinion
did
not
distinguish
speak
to
this
contract
as
such.
mr.
theodore
sachs
there
is
an
earlier
case
not
involving
these
parties,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
sachs
yes
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
sachs
yes.
mr.
theodore
sachs
of
course,
fairly
statutory
reasons.
mr.
theodore
sachs
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
sachs
that
is
correct.
i
hope
i
have
answered
the
court’s
questions.
mr.
theodore
sachs
well,
your
honor
i
am
not
sure.
i
do
not
know
what
time
is
now
left.
mr.
theodore
sachs
your
honor,
on
that
point
the
court
did
remand
with
respect
to
an
appropriate
remedy
as
to
the
retroactive
period.
that
is
not
a
piont
in
court.
mr.
theodore
sachs
yes
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
sachs
no,
of
course
not.
it
did
not
presume
to
do
so,
but
it
was
acting
not
in
the
basis,
mr.
justice
brennan,
of
the
earlier
opinion
or
on
the
basis
of
the
intervening
statute,
it
enacted
i
think
in
1973
which
at
that
point
sanctioned
such
agreements
as
this
and
did
so
expressly.
so
there
was
no
longer
a
question
of
a
statutory
basis
for
the
action
which
was
taken.
mr.
theodore
sachs
that
is
correct.
the
appellant’s
petition
on
the
grounds
which
they
would
bring
here,
we
petitioned
because
we
simply
could
not
understand
the
purpose
of
the
remand
since
there
really
was
nothing
that
was
not
moot.
since
there
had
been
no
compulsion,
we
could
not
understand
what
was
viable
for
purposes
of
any
remand
and
indeed
the
appellants
seem
to
join
with
us
in
that
quandary
as
to
what
the
purpose
of
the
remand
was.
in
any
event
that
is
not
before
this
court,
is
not
been
presented.
i
would
simply
want
to
emphasize
that
it
seems
that
in
the
light
of
the
precedence
of
this
court,
there
are
no
bases
considering
the
parallel
pattern
of
the
michigan
statute
to
that
of
the
federal
statute
if
any
genuine
first
amendment
issue
or
speech
or
association
involved.
we
are
really
back
to
the
initiative,
if
the
questions
are
here,
we
are
back
to
those
initial
questions
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
issue
is
what
this
court
characterized
in
the
last
term
in
the
black
lung
benefits
case;
usery
v.
turner,
elkhorn
as
a
legislative
act
adjusting
the
burdens
and
benefits
of
the
economic
life
and
that
is
all
that
is
involved
in
this.
such
a
statute,
it
seems
to
me,
comes
to
this
court
with
a
presumption
of
validity
and
it
is
for
the
plaintiffs
not
for
the
defendants
to
justify
it.
there
are
no
first
amendment
implications
involved.
thank
you.
