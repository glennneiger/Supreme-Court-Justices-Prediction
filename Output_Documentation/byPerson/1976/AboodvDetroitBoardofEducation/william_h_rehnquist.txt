justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
said
in
so
many
words
the
teachers
would
have
such
an
action,
did
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
it
said
if
the
union
choose
to
spend
monies
that
it
had
collected
for
political
activities,
the
court
of
appeals
described
political
activity,
then
an
action
would
lie
in
michigan
courts
against
the
union
to
recover.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
they
thought
that
they
are
giving
you
another
lawsuit
was
a
sufficient
cure
of
the
over
breadth,
if
there
was
any,
i
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
not
think
so.
you
are
talking
mostly
just
about
nomenclature
rather
than
about
the
actual
issues.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
were
attacking
a
brand
new
statute,
were
you
not,
where
nothing
had
ever
been
exacted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
did
not
get
your
answer
to
justice
white’s
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
suppose
given
the
michigan
legislature
which
presumably
exercises
the
sovereign
power
of
michigan
along
with
the
governor
has
passed
a
statute
saying
there
shall
be
public
sector
collective
bargaining?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
that
violates
the
national
league
of
cities
principle?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
did.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
question
is
singular,
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
ever
adopted
that
rule?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
said
so.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
statutory
question
was
based
on
one
of
state
law.
we
would
not
interpret
the
michigan
statute.
their
claim,
as
i
understand
to
your
opponent’s
claim,
is
that
the
compelled
deduction
of
dues
violates
their
first
amendment
rights
under
the
federal
constitution.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
response
is
that
it
does
not.
the
way
it
came
up
to
the
michigan
state
courts
was
that
the
michigan
court
said
yes,
there
is
sufficient
statutory
authorization
for
you
to
do
that
and
in
addition,
we
find
there
is
no
constitutional
violation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
not
that
the
detroit
school
board
that
is
making
the
deduction
to
bring
in
to
play
at
least
of
the
claim
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
fact
that
something
as
stay
pending
review
here
it
does
not
moot
it
for
that
reason,
as
i
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
both
parties'
petition
to
supreme
court
of
michigan
for
review
and
it
was
denied?
