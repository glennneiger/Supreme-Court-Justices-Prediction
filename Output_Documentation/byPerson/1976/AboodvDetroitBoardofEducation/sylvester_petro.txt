mr.
sylvester
petro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
court.
i
represent
the
appellant,
dissident
school
teachers
in
detroit,
who
have
declined
willingly
to
pay
dues
to
the
appellee
union.
the
appellee,
board
of
education
of
detroit
empowered
by
the
michigan
public
employment
relations
act
had
agreed
with
the
appellee,
a
federation
of
teachers
to
forge
the
union
henceforth
to
discharge
the
appellant
teachers
if
they
refuse
to
pay
agency
fees
to
the
union.
in
other
words,
what
we
have
here
is
what
is
known
as
an
agency
shop
contract;
a
contract
which
makes
the
payment
of
fees
normally
equivalent
to
union
dues,
a
condition
of
employment.
the
extraordinary
aspect
of
this
case
of
course
is
that
this
condition
of
employment
is
a
condition
not
of
private
employment,
but
of
public
employment,
an
employment
by
a
subdivision
of
the
state
of
michigan.
the
teachers
brought
suit
in
the
michigan
courts
contending
that
the
board’s
continuing
threat
of
discharge
if
they
fail
to
pay
dues
to
the
union,
constituted
an
outright
per
se
indefensible
violation
of
their
rights
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment.
they
went
further
and
alleged
that
the
michigan
statute
empowering
the
board
to
reverse
to
condition
employment
was
constitutionally
overbroad
as
well.
the
case
is
here
because
the
highest
michigan
court
to
pass
on
the
issue,
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
having
denied
an
appeal.
while
indeed
it
handed
down
a
decision
which
is
not
very
easy
to
state
clearly,
nevertheless
seem
to
have
dismissed
out
of
hand.
no
question
whatsoever
about
it;
those
aspects
of
the
complaint
which
alleged
per
se
an
indefensible
unconstitutionality.
in
what
maybe
the
one
clean-cut
holding
of
the
case,
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
did
say
that
the
michigan
para,
section
10,
authorizing
the
agency
shop
was
overbroad,
in
so
far
as
it
had
to
be
construed
according
to
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
as
authorizing
the
appellee
union
to
use
the
agency
fees,
let
us
say,
in
anyway
the
union
saw
fit,
subject
of
course
to
its
own
constitution
and
bylaws.
there
is
language
in
the
opinion
of
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
to
the
effect
that
it
is
well
recognized
that
the
union,
in
this
case,
engages
in
political
action.
the
statute
does
not
confine
the
union’s
use
of
the
exact
of
agency
fees
to
only
those
things
which
we
may
call
collective
bargaining,
but
permits
the
use
of
the
fees
for
the
times
of
political
conduct
in
which
the
union
normally
engages.
now,
while
holding
that
the
statute
did
permit
the
union
to
use
the
agency
fees
for
purposes
other
than
collective
bargaining,
including
political
purposes,
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
the
court
did
not
say
that
the
statute
was
in
consequence
thereof
unconstitutionally
overbroad.
it
is
virtually
impossible
to
avoid
drawing
the
inference
that
if
say
we
had
unable
to
obscure
the
court
to
the
wall
and
force
it
to
make
a
comment
one
way
or
the
other
on
this
issue,
it
would
have
said,
yes,
the
statute
is
unconstitutionally
overbroad.
as
a
great
judge
once
said
of
another
case,
the
opinion
is
instinct
with
that
commitment
from
the
michigan
court
of
appeals.
still
in
the
face,
there
is
broad
suggestion
of
unconstitutional
overbreadth.
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
dismissal
of
the
teachers’
petition
for
injunctive
relief.
it
affirmed
the
dismissal
of
the
teachers’
case
completely
for
that
matter.
its
idea
seem
to
be
that
if
somehow
the
teachers
managed
to
get
it
to
commit
itself
on
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute,
they
should
proceed
by
an
action
of
one
kind
or
another
thereafter
to
recover
from
the
union
the
monies
previously
exacted
and
used
by
the
union
unconstitutionally.
mr.
sylvester
petro
i
do
not
think
you
can
say
that,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
what
it
said
is
that
the
statute
could
violate
the
teachers’
rights.
mr.
sylvester
petro
that
is
what
makes
the
case
so
extraordinarily
difficult
to
deal
with.
when
the
court
says
it
is
not,
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutionally
overbroad,
but
says
instead
the
statute
could
violate
the
teachers’
rights,
all
it
has
given
as
is
another
lawsuit.
mr.
sylvester
petro
we
have
to
win
on
the
over
breadth
argument
all
over
again.
mr.
sylvester
petro
well,
our
problem
is
that
we
were
dismissed
and
we
think
that
we
were
dismissed
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
we
have
what
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
very
largely
implied
was
a
good
constitutional
claim.
now,
if
you
are
correct,
justice
rehnquist,
in
suggesting
that
we
won
on
that
point
then
of
course,
the
denial
of
release
is
inexplicable
and
plainly
incompatible
with
everything
this
court
has
had
to
say
about
violations
of
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
sylvester
petro
well,
that
is
what
it
is
based
on,
but
this
is
not,
i
mean,
there
is
no
way
to
ground
this
holding
and
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
sylvester
petro
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
demanded
of
our
clients,
a
kind
of
conduct
preparatory
to
action
that
has
not
been
required
in
any
first
amendment
case
that
i
have
ever
encountered
and
i
believe
that
i
try
to
read
them
all.
mr.
sylvester
petro
well,
there
are
all
sorts
of
people
paying
agency
fees
under
that
statute.
it
is
only
our
clients
who
had
refused
for
a
good
long
while
to
pay
the
agency
fees.
still
some
have
refused,
but
others
under
protest
have
because
of
the
continued
threats
from
the
detroit
board
of
education
to
discharge
them,
they
have
now
been
paying
agency
fees.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
other
side
makes
a
great
deal
of
this,
acting
as
low,
our
clients
have
disqualified
themselves
from
this
suit
because
they
have
paid
the
fees
under
protest.
now,
this
is
perfectly
understandable
that
they
should
do
so.
many
of
them
have
been
detroit
school
teachers
for
a
good
long
while.
they
are
not
about
to
give
up
their
jobs
even
though
maybe
they
will
get
reinstatement
at
some
future
time,
but
they
have
preserved
their
rights;
their
payments
have
been
under
protest.
there
has
been
no
deliberate
waiver.
mr.
sylvester
petro
at
the
farthest
breach….
mr.
sylvester
petro
we
insist
that
compelling
these
teachers
to
pay
$0.01
to
the
union
for
whatever
purpose
is
a
per
se
violation
of
the
rights
of
freedom
of
association
and
that
this
stand
is
made,
and
a
fortiori
one,
because
it
is
inconceivable
in
view
of
what
it
is
that
public
sector
unions
actually
do.
by
the
common
consent
of
every
qualified
person
who
has
ever
said
a
word
on
this
subject,
everything
that
public
sector
unions
do
is
political
and
ideological
and
character.
now,
we
have
presented….
mr.
sylvester
petro
well,
the
answer
was
yes.
it
was
an
emphatic
yes.
mr.
sylvester
petro
well,
as
i
see
things,
justice
white,
you
see
that
would
not
be
any
concession
on
my
part
because
everything…
mr.
sylvester
petro
well,
the
essential
function
of
a
union
is
to
engage
in
these
negotiations
of
one
kind
or
another
with
their
opposite
numbers.
now,
it
is
true
i
suppose,
i
should
certainly
have
to
withdraw
the
suggestion
that
there
is
no
conceivable
way
in
which
the
union
could
spend
money
non-politically.
i
said,
well,
they
have
backed
for
the
teamsters
used
to
spend
teamster
money
on
trips
to
europe
and
it
would
be
hard
put
to
establish
this
as
a
political
expenditure.
mr.
sylvester
petro
that
is
true
qualification
except
--
mr.
sylvester
petro
well,
once
again
the
question
is….
mr.
sylvester
petro
let
me
say
justice
marshall
that
all
the
activities
--
mr.
sylvester
petro
i
am
ready
now
to
concede
that
all
of
the
activities
other
than
those
that
the
union
refers
to
as
collective
bargaining
may
putatively
be
non-political
in
character.
one
would
have
to
make
an
examination
of
instance
after
instance
to
determine
but
as
far
as
those
activities
which
the
union
has
generally
been
characterizing
by
the
words
collective
bargaining.
mr.
sylvester
petro
that
is
correct
and
i
think
that
this
court’s
decision
last
term,
in
the
national
league
of
cities
case
puts
this
proposition
beyond
any
further
doubt.
if
it
is
true
as
was
held
in
the
national
league
of
cities
case
that
the
determination
and
administration
of
the
state
or
locality’s
employment
practices
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
a
state’s
sovereignty
and
sovereignty
is
of
course
the
political
principle
by
its
alliance.
then
public
sector
collective
bargaining
which
is
explicitly
designed
to
influence
and
effect,
rearrange
and
displace
the
sovereign
decisions
of
the
states
and
localities
in
respect
of
their
employment
must
of
necessity
also
be
political
in
character.
mr.
sylvester
petro
yes
indeed
and
i
suppose
the
michigan
legislature
has
in
that
for
the
first
time
engaged
in
a
constitutionally
dubious
piece
of
conduct.
mr.
sylvester
petro
the
national
league
of
cities
principle,
i
think
you
wrote
that
opinion.
mr.
sylvester
petro
the
national
league
of
cities
case
said
that
the
determination
of
the
wages,
hours
and
other
conditions
of
employment
is
an
integral
aspect
of
the
sovereignty
of
a
state.
now,
if
we
have
a
state
of
michigan
which
proceeds
to
give
away
this
sovereign
authority,
what
is
the
situation
we
find
ourselves
in,
are
states
permitted
in
light
of
their
duties
to
their
constituents
to
the
people
to
whom
they
owe
their
ultimate
power
and
position?
are
states
permitted
thus
to
dispense
with,
to
disperse,
to
share
out,
to
give
to
this
or
that
private
agency
pieces
of
the
state’s
sovereign
powers?
i
should
point
out
that
we
are
getting
into
very
deep
water
here.
mr.
sylvester
petro
some
of
us,
one
of
us;
for
it
is
not
i
who
raised
the
question
whether
the
state
of
michigan
in
passing
the
para
into
conflict
with
the
league
of
cities
case.
what
i
have
suggested
is
that
in
passing
para,
section
10,
authorizing
the
agency
shop,
the
michigan
legislature
was
in
trouble
with
the
national
league
of
cities
case
as
well
as
with
a
number
of
other
decisions
handed
down
last
term,
most
notably
elrod
v.
burns.
i
think
elrod
v.
burns
is
a
case
which
is
virtually
indistinguishable
from
this
one.
may
i
proceed,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
sylvester
petro
my
instincts
do
not
permit
me
to
end
this
abruptly
so
i
must
point
out
that
there
are
some
features
about
this
case
that
need
emphasis
and
need
emphasis
in
connection
with
the
discussion
that
we
have
just
been
having.
i
shall
go
over
them
very
rapidly
because
i
do
wish
to
save
ten
minutes
for
rebuttal.
now,
the
first
and
i
believe
the
most
profound
element
in
this
case
lies
in
the
distinction
between
the
activities
of
government
and
the
activities
of
private
persons.
government
is
one
thing
and
private
persons
and
their
activity
are
strictly
another.
there
is
a
great
deal
made
by
the
other
side
of
the
fact
that
collective
bargaining,
while
collective
bargaining
in
the
private
sector
is
the
same
thing
as
collective
bargaining
in
the
public
sector,
i
believe
that
this
lacks
as
much
discernment
has
would
be
lacked
by
a
person
who
said
that
all
of
the
fords
that
roll
of
a
ford
assembling
line
are
the
same;
it
does
not
matter
that
one
is
driven
by
sylvester
petro,
a
private
person
and
the
other
is
driven
by
a
policeman
and
is
owned
by
a
police
force.
they
look
alike,
but
they
are
different.
the
same
thing
is
true,
say,
of
the
jet
engines
that
are
produced
in
such
numbers.
some
go
into
passenger
commercial
flights
and
others
go
into
b1
bombers
or
b52.
you
take
that
same
engine,
take
it
out
of
a
passenger
plane,
put
it
into
a
bomber
and
you
have
got
a
different
animal.
in
the
same
way,
that
activity
of
collective
bargaining
which
looks
as
though
it
is
exactly
the
same
in
the
public
sector
as
it
is
in
the
private
sector
is
a
different
animal
entirely.
it
is
an
animal
that
participates
of
the
political
character
of
a
government
that
constitutes
the
employer
and
when
that
collective
bargaining
thus
becomes
political
in
character
to
ask
or
to
insist
that
a
public
employee
against
his
will,
finance
it,
it
is
the
same
as
forcing
upon
that
public
school
teacher,
political
and
ideological
objectives
which
quite
obviously
cannot
be
squared
with
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
a
clear
compromise
of
the
dissident
teachers’
political
associational
and
speech
rights
is
present
in
the
case
of
this
kind.
thank
you.
mr.
sylvester
petro
i
am
sorry,
i
made
my
apologies.
mr.
sylvester
petro
i
shall
do
so.
mr.
sylvester
petro
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
associate
justices,
i
think
thoroughly
without
any
intention
mr.
sachs
has
completely
misled
us
all
concerning
the
posture
of
this
case.
it
all
goes
back
to
the
smigel
decision
by
the
michigan
supreme
court
holding
that
in
the
absence
of
an
authorizing
agency
shop
provision
in
the
michigan
para,
no
public
employer
could
as
a
matter
of
statutory
power
enter
a
union
or
agency
shop
contract.
now
after
that
decision,
the
michigan
legislature
proceeded
immediately
to
pass
the
statute
wanting
as
of
the
time
of
the
smigel
decision.
now,
observe
very
carefully
honorable
justices,
it
was
after
the
passage
of
that
enabling
agency
shop
provision
that
the
contract
in
issue
in
this
case
was
entered
by
the
parties.
if
this
does
not
establish
a
federal
question,
then
i
do
not
know
what
a
federal
question
is.
the
contract
involved
in
this
case
was
entered
by
the
parties
after
the
passage
of
1973
michigan
para,
section
10.
now,
since
i
have
only
three
minutes
left,
let
me
proceed
immediately.
mr.
sylvester
petro
this
was
involved
in
the
question
whether
or
not
a
contract
then
existed.
a
contract
prior
to
the
one
sub
judice
should
be
applicable
to
the
plaintiff
in
that
case,
not
this
one.
this
is
a
new
bargain.
mr.
sylvester
petro
no,
an
aspect
of
that
contract
involved
in
the
warczak
case
was
controlled
by
force
of
precedence
not
by
force
of
judgment
in
the
smigel
decision.
this
court
held
only
that
as
to
that
period,
all
these
people
were
employees
throughout
that
period,
throughout
that
period
they
are
involved
in
the
smigel
case,
throughout
the
period
involved
in
this
abood,
warczak
case.
now,
the
question
was
whether
or
not
they
were
going
to
be
affected
by
the
michigan
para’s
amendment
1973,
which
--
the
language
of
it
is
relevant
here.
the
michigan
para
speaks
in
terms
of
reaffirming
its
favoring
an
agency
shop.
it
is
a
sort
of,
if
i
may
say
so
without
antagonizing
the
court,
a
kind
of
shelving
used
by
the
michigan
legislature
designed
to
establish
retroactively
the
validity
of
the
agency
shop
para
passed
in
1973.
then
the
only
thing
that
this
michigan
court
of
appeals,
from
which
we
are
appealing,
did
with
respect
to
that
was
saying
no,
there
cannot
be
no
--
mr.
sylvester
petro
pardon
me.
mr.
sylvester
petro
this
particular
case?
mr.
sylvester
petro
in
1969,
yes.
mr.
sylvester
petro
no,
it
applied
as
of
the
time
when
the
case
came
back
up
to
us,
a
contract,
the
contract
of
these
parties
are
bound
by,
if
they
are
bound
at
all,
is
a
contract
entered
by
the
parties
after
1969
--
73.
mr.
sylvester
petro
october
--
mr.
sylvester
petro
yes,
it
is
in
the
record,
let
us
see.
see
the
record
brief
in
support
of
claim

court

appendices
d
and

letter
from
theodore

honorable
charles
kaufman
of

circuit
court,

enclosure.
mr.
justice
marshall
there
cannot
be
any
doubt
whatsoever
that
the
contract
involved
in
this
case
is
a
contract
postdating
the
michigan
para
amendment
the
constitutionality
of
which
we
are
challenging.
no
doubt
whatsoever
this
is
the
contract
in
issue
in
this
case,
not
the
one
that
was
the
subject
of
the
smigel
decision
and
which
by
virtue
of
this
smigel
decision
--
mr.
sylvester
petro
smigel
is
the
decision
in
which
the
michigan
supreme
court
stimulated
the
legislation
that
is
involved
here.
had
this
michigan
supreme
court
not
decided
in
smigel
that
the
state
local
authorities
were
without
power
to
enter
agency
shop
agreements
we
should
probably
never
have
had
this
statute.
mr.
sylvester
petro
well,
smigel
is
not
my
case.
mr.
sylvester
petro
well,
it
provides
the
background
for
the
michigan
para
amendment.
the
michigan
agency
shop
statute
was
passed
because
the
michigan
legislature
found
that
it
could
not
have
agency
shops
and
public
employment
without
specifically
authorizing
that.
i
beg
the
court
for
two
minutes
in
order
to
make
what
i
think
is
the
final
point
that
must
be
made.
may
i
have
them,
please?
mr.
sylvester
petro
the
fundamental
deficiency
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
first
amendment
in
this
case
is
that
the
union
intends
to
have
to
put
it
most
mildly
forced
loans
from
the
teachers,
in
order
to
use
those
forced
loans
to
promote
political
causes
to
which
the
teachers
must
be
presumed
in
view
of
their
general
objection,
the
features
are
opposed
to
them.
now,
there
is
no
way
that
forcing
people
to
support
political
causes
to
which
they
are
opposed
can
be
squared
with
either
the
first
amendment
or
this
court’s
uniform
decision
there
under.
mr.
sylvester
petro
well,
it
goes
to
the
rebate
procedure.
the
rebate
procedure
is
nothing
but
--
mr.
sylvester
petro
i
pray
the
court’s
indulgence
for
just
one
word.
