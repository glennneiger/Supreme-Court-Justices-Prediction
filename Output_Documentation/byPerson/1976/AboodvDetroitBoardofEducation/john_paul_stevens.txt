justice
john
paul
stevens
under
your
understanding
of
the
court
of
appeals
ruling,
would
a
particular
member
of
the
plaintiff
group
have
to
object
to
particular
expenditures
or
would
it
be
sufficient
for
him
generally
to
object
to
expenditure
of
any
money
for
any
political
purpose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
happens
to
the
union
member
who
does
not
particularly
want
to
disclose
his
disagreement
with
particular
union
policies
or
political
policies
advocated
by
the
union,
but
just
does
not
his
money
spent
for
any
particular
political,
activity
in
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
can
he
then,
i
will
go
back
to
my
first
question;
can
he
then
simply
say
i
do
not
want
you
spending
my
money
for
any
political
purpose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
happens
then,
does
he
get
all
his
money
back
or…?
justice
john
paul
stevens
…by
this
court
in
this
court
in
this
case
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
is
that
total
computed,
how
you
are
going
to
compute
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
tell
me
in
dollars
and
cents.
say
there
is
this
$50,
how
much
do
they
get
back
if
he
says
i
do
not
want
you
spending
my
money
for
political
purposes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
40%
of
your
budget
is
political;
does
he
get
40%
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
sachs,
i
am
not
really
pointing.
i
understand
you
generally
are
taking
the
position
that
the
rebate
procedure
is
not
right
for
decision
in
the
state.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
also
perhaps
true
that
the
statute
itself
is
not
really
before
us
because
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
read
the
opinion,
held
that
it
did
not
apply
to
existing
contracts,
it
did
not
have
retroactive
effect
and
though
we
have
a
prior
contract
involved
in
this
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
litigant
before
us
does
not
have
standing
to
attack
the
statute
as
i
piece
it
all
together,
am
i
right
in
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
it
is
a
jurisdictional
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
not
require
us
to
dismiss
this
appeal
and
have
the
case
come
up
where
someone
else
was
involved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand,
you
are
not
relying
on
it,
but
we
have
a
duty
to
satisfy
our
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
hold
that
the
statute
did
not
apply
to
the
contract
in
this
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
are
really
being
asked
to
review
some
dictum
in
the
court
of
appeal’s
opinion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
the
federal
statute,
but
you
now
concede
in
view
of
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
statute
does
not
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
does
not
apply
to
this
case.
so
you
have
no
defense
on
the
statute,
there
is
no
statutory
question
before
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
counsel,
is
that
not
true
that
the
compulsion
for
the
deduction
as
to
this
contract
is
solely
based
on
the
contract,
there
is
no
statutory
authorization
for
deduction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
said
the
statute
is
totally
void,
it
never
been
passed
or
something
like
that,
it
has
hed
that
it
does
not
apply
to
this
contract,
then
you
would
not
have
been
able
to
compel
the
deduction
because
of
an
independent
state
ground
reason,
is
it
not
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
is
really
no
federal
question
before
us
as
what
i
am
saying
is
there
is
no
compulsion
now
for
a
deduction
as
to
these
particular
litigants?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
to
this
claim,
did
not
the
michigan
court
hold
that
he
was
right
apart
from
this
later
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
petro,
may
i
just
ask
why
then
in
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
did
they
discuss
the
issue
of
retroactivity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
means
in
other
words
if
the
contract
in
the
record
before
us
is
different
from
the
contracts
in
the
record
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
where
you
nevertheless
were
reviewing
that
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
contract
in
this
record,
the
73
contract
in
this
record?
