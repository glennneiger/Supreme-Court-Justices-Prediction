chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
only
a
minute
or
two
left
to
the
end
of
your
rebuttal
time
now,

you
wish
to
save

chief

mr.

do
you
have
anything
further?
you
have
six
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
go
ahead
and
respond

to
further
response
to

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
you
are
restating
the
arguments
you
made
before
us
so
we
have
that
argument.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
covered
that
sufficiently
counsel.
i
want
to
add
something
to
what
my
brother
blackmun
said
about
this
case.
you
filed
a
216
page
brief
here
and
i
address
this
not
as
a
criticism
to
you
primarily,
but
as
an
observation
to
the
bar.
in
this
case
there
are
600
pages
of
material
filed
with
us
which
means
that
if
every
case
heard
today
had
been
treated
the
same
way,
the
members
of
this
court
would
have
had
2,400
pages
to
read
not
including
the
cases
and
other
authorities
cited
which
we
do
read,
and
i
think
in
a
sense
you
may
have
done
a
favor
to
the
court
to
furnish
an
exhibit
a
for
why
we
should
activate
a
rule
limiting
the
briefs
in
this
court
to
50
pages
unless
the
court
grants
special
leave.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
know,
i
need
no
response
to
that.
i
am
simply
making
an
observation
to
bar
generally
as
well
as
to
you
because
you
have
filed
at
216
page
brief
when
75
pages
easily
would
have
done
it.
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
75-1153,
abood
against
the
detroit
board
of
education
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
stewart.
