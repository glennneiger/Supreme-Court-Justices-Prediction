justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
michigan.
the
state
of
michigan
has
enacted
legislation
authorizing
union
representation
of
local
governmental
employees.
a
union
and
a
local
government
employer
are
specifically
permitted
to
agree
to
an
agency
shop
arrangement
whereby
every
employee
represented
by
a
union
even
though
not
a
union
member
must
pay
to
the
union
as
extension
of
employment
a
service
fee
to
union
duty.
the
issue
in
this
case
whether
this
arrangement
violates
the
constitutional
rights
of
government
employees
who
object
to
public
sector
unions
as
such
or
to
various
unions'
activities
finance
by
the
compulsory
service
fees.
for
the
reasons
set
out
at
some
length
in
the
written
opinion
of
the
court
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
we
hold
that
a
state
law
authorizing
unionization
and
an
agency
shop
arrangement
for
public
sector
employees
in
this
case,
detroit
school
teachers
is
not
constitutionally
invalid
for
collective
bargaining
purposes.
but
we
further
hold
that
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments,
no
such
employee
maybe
required
to
give
financial
support
to
the
furtherance
of
any
idealogical
cause
with
which
he
disagrees.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
michigan
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
that
court
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
court's
opinion.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
mr.
justice
stevens
while
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court
have
each
filed
concurring
opinions.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
only
in
the
court's
judgment.
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
have
joined
mr.
justice
powell's
separate
opinion.
