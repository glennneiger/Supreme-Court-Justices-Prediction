unknown
speaker
was
it
a
denial
based
upon
the
statement
of
the
court
that
your
clients
made
no
allegations
at
any
event,
specifically
protested
the
expenditure
of
their
funds
for
political
purposes
to
which
they
objected?
unknown
speaker
therefore
the
plaintiffs
are
not
entitled
to
relief
on
this
basis.
unknown
speaker
let
us
suppose
they
had
a
party
every
friday
night,
just
a
pure
social
event?
unknown
speaker
you
said
bargaining
for
a
contract,
bargaining
about
wages
would
be
categorized
as
political,
when
you
are
bargaining
with
the
public
parties?
unknown
speaker
did
you
write
this
brief?
i
am
afraid
to
acknowledge
and
that
is
why
i
am
sure
every
member
of
this
court
feels
it
has
been
greatly
imposed
upon
by
its
language.
would
you
think
that
this
case
needs
216
pages
plus
53
of
responsive
brief
of
269
pages?
we
do
have
a
lot
of
cases
here.
unknown
speaker
another
question
i
want
to
ask
was,
you
do
not
have
to
answer
this
one,
but
you
might
reread
the
summary
of
the
argument
and
my
question
is
whether
it
complies
with
our
rules
as
to
being
a
summary
of
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
but
it
does
involve,
however,
compulsory
financial
tribute
to
the
union,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
or
by
the
state
as
a
condition
of
governmental
employment.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
is
not
then
dictionary
meaning
of
the
word
tribute?
unknown
speaker
am
i
mistaken
in
my
recollection
that
the
federal
labor
legislation
excludes
governmental
employers?
unknown
speaker
does
the
legislative
history
of
that
legislation
show
why?
unknown
speaker
but
it
does
clearly
exclude?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
excludes
any
kind
of
federal
governmental
employers
also
then.
unknown
speaker
are
those
cases
applicable
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
not
directly.
unknown
speaker
who
determines
in
this
context
what
is
political
and
what
is
non-political?
unknown
speaker
yes,
well
under
this,
who
would
determine
that
what
portion
of
the
union’s
expenditures
were
for
political
purposes
and
what
the
subject
to
refund?
unknown
speaker
who
was
that?
unknown
speaker
but
the
applicant
for
a
refund
would
have
no
voice
in
choosing
that
panel?
unknown
speaker
how
is
that
procedure
constituted;
just
by
the
union
or
by
statute
or
by
court’s
interpretation
or
what?
unknown
speaker
what
does
it
include
within
the
term
political?
unknown
speaker
but
does
everything
fall
within
political
other
than
the
services
of
the
union
in
negotiating
and
administering
the
collective
bargaining
contracts?
unknown
speaker
assume
the
member
or
the
applicant
does
not
get
what
he
thinks
he
is
entitled
to
and
disagrees
with
the
union’s
determination
of
what
is
political,
may
he
go
to
court?
unknown
speaker
would
there
be
a
cause
of
action
formed
in
state
court?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sachs,
what
about
those
non-political
expenditures
that
are
also
non-beneficial
to
the
appellants,
i
am
thinking
of
social
expenditures
or
conventions
and
publication
expenditures
and
travel
to
expense
and,
if
you
will,
organization
elsewhere?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
--
not
that
i
completely
follow
by
brother
stevens’
suggestion,
it
is
that
since
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
statute
did
not
apply
to
the
contact
in
effect,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
under
those
circumstances,
there
is
no
standing
in
this.
unknown
speaker
well,
jurisdictional
understanding
sense
is
not
--
as
i
understand
it?
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
it
did
not
apply
as
a
contact
in
this
record,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
certainly
in
case
of
controversy
between
the
employees
and
the
union,
i
mean
this
cause
of
action
was
or
his
claim
was
that
the
agency
shop
clause
and
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
invalid.
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
certainly
--
he
has
got
to
think
of
a
controversy.
he
does
not
want
to
pay
over
the
fee,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
you
would
not
say
it
is
a
article
3,
case
or
controversy
point.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
jurisdictional.
unknown
speaker
but
just
whether
he
has
standing
to
attack
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
have
not,
but
suppose
that
he
refused
to
pay
under
this
collective
bargaining
agreement,
would
he
be
fired?
unknown
speaker
let
us
suppose
the
statute
is
never
been
passed?
unknown
speaker
would
he
have
been
fired?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
then
that
you
were
defending;
you
are
the
one
who
is
relying
on
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
not
the
plaintiff.
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
the
one
who
raised
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
otherwise
you
would
have
lost
under
the
prior
trial?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
part
of
the
plan
of
the
plaintiff
was
not
in
his
complaint
that
was
unconstitutional
for
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
state
to
compel
and
to
contribute
to
the
union
activity?
unknown
speaker
that
claim
did
not
depend
on
whether
there
is
a
statute
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
you
relied
on
the
statue
and
say
that
the
reason
that
is
now
valid
is
because
there
is
a
right
to
a
refund.
now,
whether
or
not
that
the
michigan
statue
was
in
existence
or
not,
this
petitioner’s
claim
was
rejected
and
part
of
his
claim
was
that
collecting
a
fee
to
support
union
activities
was
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
and
it
still
is
claim
right
here,
the
number
one
claim.
unknown
speaker
statue
or
not,
that
is
part
of
his
claim
right
now.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sachs,
i
still
do
not
follow
you
colloquy
with
my
brother
white.
didn't
you
tell
us
that
michigan
supreme
court
said
that
this
very
contract
between
the
school
board
and
its
union
was
invalid
under
the
statutory
authority?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
thought
you
referred
to
some
earlier
opinion.
unknown
speaker
alright,
not
involving
these
parties,
but
a
contract
between
a
public
party
and
the
labor
union?
unknown
speaker
with
an
agency
clause
in
it?
unknown
speaker
and
there
held
that
the
agency
clause
was
unenforceable,
invalid
whatever?
unknown
speaker
alright,
and
it
would
not
have
applied
if
this
statute
is
not
applicable
to
the
particular
contract
which
got
involved
here
then
where
is
the
first
amendment
issue?
unknown
speaker
the
petitioner’s
claim
was
overruled
though.
it
was
rejected
by
the
michigan
supreme
court
or
by
the
michigan
court,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
that
included
the
rejection
of
his
first
amendment
claim
with
or
without
a
statue?
unknown
speaker
well,
at
least
federal
question
here,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
sure
it
does.
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
make
an
issue
here.
unknown
speaker
the
petitioner
should
have
won
that,
but
he
did
not,
did
he?
