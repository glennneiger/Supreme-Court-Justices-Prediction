mr.
wollenberg,
can
i
interrupt
you
for
just
a
second?
does
the
full
text
of
the
letter
of
june
30,
1972
appear
in
the
papers
before
us
anywhere?
i
know
it
is
referred
to
as
exhibit
5
to
the
complaint
but
that
wasn’t
reprinted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you
very
much.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallenberg,
may
i
give
you
a
hypothetical
that
has
been
troubling
me,
as
i
think
about
this
case?
supposing
the
attorney
general
after
30
days
at
run,
wrote
a
letter
saying
“my
office
is
terribly
busy.
these
are
awfully
complicated
matters.
i
don’t
have
a
big
enough
staff
to
handle
them
intelligently
therefore
i
will
not
issue
a
letter.”
could
that
be
reviewed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that
kind
of
a
disposition
would
be
reviewable
would
not
that
be
a
way
in
which
he
could
get
additional
time
to
make
such
an
announcement
to
have
somebody
bring
a
suit
saying
you
should
not
do
it
on
that
basis,
then
you
would
have
all
the
time
in
the
world
to
study
the
matter,
wouldn’t
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
