we
think
the
case
involved
of
the
threshold
question
of
the
reviewability
of
his
failure
to
object.
justice

was
there
any
question
as
to
whether
that
was
reviewable?

that
letter
is
an
appendix
here
somewhere.
justice

at
your
submission
that,
even
though
this
can
be
defended
as
more
or
less
reasonable
at
least
at
the
time
that
it
was
made
in
the
light
of
the
--
then
state
of
the
law.
i
thought
it
was
your
position
that
even
he
had
said
“we
are
opposing
no
objection
because
of
south
carolina
voted
republican
at
the
last
election”.
even
that
would
not
be
reviewable.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
said,
he
didn’t
object,
he
says,
we
are
interposing
no
objection
because
your
state
voted
right
at
the
last
election.
what
if
he
did
that,
would
that
be
reviewable?
in
your
submission
it
would
not
be
isn’t
it
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
even
if
it
does
go,
and
necessarily
goes
that
far
as
i
understand
it,
and
i
do
not
find
that
shocking.
justice
potter
stewart
exactly,
that
is
your
submission.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
reason
they
put
the
onus
on
the
attorney
general.
