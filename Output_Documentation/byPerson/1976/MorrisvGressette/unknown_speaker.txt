unknown
speaker
that
determination
is
not
binding
on
us
i
suppose,
is
it?
south
carolina
was
not
a
party
to
the
litigation
in
that
case.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
the
attorney
general’s
time
to
object
was
told
by
the
court
orders,
actually
the
court
orders
themselves
were
issued
after
the
expiration
of
the
60-day
period,
were
they
not?
can
you
answer
that
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
isn’t
it
a
fact
that
that
order
itself
was
entered
after
the
expiration
of
60
days,
following
a
submission
of
south
carolina’s
plan?
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
wrong
on
that
--
if
you
say
it
is
immaterial,
you
must
mean
that
even
if
you
are
wrong
on
that
and
the
attorney
general’s
60-day
period
had
expired
before
there
was
ever
any
court
order,
you
can
nonetheless
(inaudible),
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
the
attorney
general
is
always
free
to
simply
say
on
the
60th
day,
i
object
because
your
plan
does
not
quite
convince
me
and
has
he
asked
for
more
information.
unknown
speaker
would
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
have
been
limited
in
venue
to
the
district
court
to
the
district
of
columbia
or
could
they
have
brought
suit
anywhere?
unknown
speaker
in
harper,
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
of
course,
the
administrative
procedure
act
allows
you
to
sue
the
attorney
general
anywhere
that
either
a
plaintiff
or
plaintiff
reside.
unknown
speaker
well
certainly,
it
would
be
unusual
if
it
could
be
brought
somewhere
else.
wouldn’t
it?
if
the
state
is
limited
to
the
district
of
columbia
and
yet
the
plaintiffs
in
harper
v
levi
in
a
review
of
the
attorney
general’s
action
on
the
administrative
procedure
act
could
sue
in
any
venue
in
the
country.
unknown
speaker
and
i
take
it,
you
say
that
a
state
law
would
not
be
in
effect
during
this
review
period.
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
any
court,
i
take
it
you
say,
could
extend
the
time
of
the
attorney
general.
and
any
time
they
extended
the
time
it
just
has
not
expired
and
the
law
has
not
gone
into
effect.
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
attorney
general
says
that
“i
don’t
want
any
more
time,
i
am
not
going
to
object.”
may
court
with
jurisdiction
as
you
say,
extend
his
time
at
the
suit
of
some
private
party.
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
is
yes,
that
the
state
law
would
not
be
in
effect
throughout
this
review
period
on
appeal
maybe
to
this
court.
unknown
speaker
if
the
state
chooses
to
go
to
the
three-judge
court
in
the
district
of
columbia,
what
about
intervention
by
private
parties?
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
know?
has
there
been
a
law
on
it
or
not?
unknown
speaker
when
the
states
sues,
the
state
just
--who
is
the
defendant
in
that
suit?
unknown
speaker
not
the
attorney
general?
just
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
your
interest
in
the
case,
i
take
it,
is
you
think
the
standards
of
the
voting
rights
act
are
considerably
different
than
the
constitutional
standard?
unknown
speaker
there
was
the
difference
in
the
substantive
standard
also,
isn’t
there?
unknown
speaker
isn’t
there
a
difference
also
in
the
substantive
standard?
doesn’t
the
beers
case
indicate
that?
unknown
speaker
it
is
more
difficult
than
no
matter
who
has
the
burden
of
proof.
the
standard
of
the
voting
rights
act
has
more
stringent
standard
than
that
of
either
the
fourteenth
or
fifteen
amendment,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
mr.
turner
that
if
the
state
submits
a
plan
to
the
attorney
general,
he
rejects
or
objects
to
it
in
60
days
and
the
state
does
not
bring
any
suit
in
the
district
court,
it
just
kind
of
accepts
the
attorney
general’s
rejection,
that
private
plaintiffs
in
the
state
could
bring
in
action
to
review
the
attorney
generals
objection
under
the
administrative
procedure
act?
unknown
speaker
mr.
turner,
does
the
statute
require
the
attorney
general
to
give
a
statement
of
reasons
for
either
an
objection
or
a
non-objection?
i
know,
he
does
this
as
a
matter
of
policy.
unknown
speaker
if
he
should
change
that
policy
would
you
say
that
the
existence
to
review
would
compel
him
to
adapt
the
policy?
unknown
speaker
if
in
his
letter
that
he
did
write
here
instead
of
saying
he
was
constrained
to
follow
the
three-judge
court,
if
instead
of
that,
he
said,
i
think
as
a
matter
of
discretion,
a
sound
policy
to
do
the
same
thing
the
district
court
did.
would
that
have
been
reviewable?
unknown
speaker
your
position
depended
on
a
reading
of
that
letter
that
he
felt
legally
bound
to
follow
that.
unknown
speaker
may
i
repeat
the
question,
i
thought
mr.
justice
stevens
was
asking?
let
us
assume
that
the
attorney
general
had
written
a
letter
within
the
60-day
period
in
which
in
substance
he
said
“i
think
the
reapportionment
plan
fully
comports
with
the
law.
you
have
my
authority
to
proceed
with
it.
is
your
contention
that
there
would
still
be
review
by
these
parties
under
the
apa?
unknown
speaker
your
answer
would
be
the
same,
if
the
attorney
general
did
nothing
within
the
60
days?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
he
just
said
nothing.
he
would
just
let
the
60
days
go
by
like
an
ordinary
statute
of
limitations.
unknown
speaker
take
another
hypothetical.
suppose,
the
attorney
general
had
ruled
in
favor
of
the
harper
plaintiffs
originally
within
the
60-day
period?
i
agree
that
the
state
of
south
carolina
would
have
had
no
remedy
other
than
as
prescribed
by
the
act
to
come
before
a
three-judge
court
in
the
district.
let
us
assume
that
say
a
state
senator
in
south
carolina
who
would
lose
his
seat
decided
that
the
attorney
general
had
made
a
gross
error
of
law.
would
he
have
the
same
right
that
mr.
harper
had
to
institute
an
action
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
challenging
the
attorney
general’s
decision
on
a
legal
ground?
unknown
speaker
would
that
right
be
limited
by
any
period
of
limitations?
could
it
have
been
brought
a
year
later?
unknown
speaker
mr.
turner
can
i
just
ask
one
more
question
because
mr.
justice
powell
followed
up
on
a
thought
that
i
had;
you
answered
him
by
saying
if
the
letter
by
the
attorney
general
said
i
am
not
going
to
object
because
i
find
that
the
plan
is
lawful
on
all
respects
that
would
not
be
reviewable,
i
understood
you
to
say.
what
if
they
made
a
clearer
law
and
he
was
wrong?
somebody
came
and
said
that
legally
your
answer
is
just
dead
wrong
just
as
it
was
here.
why
would
that
be
different?
unknown
speaker
but
the
question
whether
it
is
lawful
or
unlawful
is
not
a
question
of
discretion,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
he
says
i
have
discretion
to
review
it.
i
have
reviewed
it
and
find
it
is
lawful.
unknown
speaker
even
though
he
has
made
a
plainly
erroneous
ruling
of
law?
unknown
speaker
suppose
that
the
attorney
general
does
not
object,
or
suppose
he
specifically
says
that
he
is
not
planning
to
object.
he
says
he's
carefully
reviewed
the
plan
and
the
state
statute
goes
in
to
effect.
may
a
private
party
then
bring
an
independent
suit
to
enjoin
the
operation
of
the
statute,
not
on
constitutional
grounds
but
on
the
ground
that
it
does
not
comply
with
section
5?
unknown
speaker
have
there
been
some
decisions,
have
there
been
some
attempts
at
private
suits
to
enjoin
the...
unknown
speaker
well,
on
the
other
hand,
if
congress
has
provided
a
statutory
standard
which
new
voting
procedures
must
conform
to.
why
would
you
argue
that
congress
did
not
intend
a
private
party
to
be
able
to
sue
on
the
basis
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
now
when
you
say
substantive
contest
on
the
merits,
you
are
talking
about
the
constitution
of
the
suit...
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that
is
not
as
necessarily
as
broader
remedy.
in
other
words
the
plaintiffs
might
lose
that
suit
and
still
the
attorney
general's
objection
be
sustained
in
a
suit
brought
by
the
state
challenging
it
in
a
three-judge
district
court
here
in
the
district
of
columbia,
might
it
not?
unknown
speaker
are
you
speaking
of
the
one
you
referred
to
before?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
preliminary
issue.
unknown
speaker
we
think
that
your
position
at...
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
then
you
would
day
that
his
non-objection
would
not
be
reviewable
even
if
he
just
says
we
are
not
interposing
an
objection
because
we
have
not
had
time
to
look
at
it.
unknown
speaker
we
are
just
not
able
to
do
the
job
that
the
statute
contemplates.
would
you
say,
non-
review?
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
must
say
that
because
it
sounds
to
me
like
that
is
precisely
what
happened
--
in
effect
what
happened
here
because
he
never,
never
looked
at
it
in
the
light
of
the
section
5
standard.
he
simply
said
“some
courts
decided
it
is
constitutional”.
so
it
is
just
the
same
as
saying,
“i
have
never
looked
at
it
from
the
stand
point
of
section
5”.
unknown
speaker
that
seems
to
me...
unknown
speaker
well,
no
it
isn’t
that
shocking,
it's
true.
unknown
speaker
or
even
the
right
thing.
unknown
speaker
he
might
have
been
egregiously
wrong
but
i
thought
it
was
your
argument
that
it
is
simply
not
reviewable.
unknown
speaker
well
i
would
not
back
away
from
it,
if
i
were
you.
unknown
speaker
copy
or
oversight,
if
you…
unknown
speaker
mr.
bell,
think
hypothetically,
please.
unknown
speaker
the
state,
yes
that
is
right.
unknown
speaker
the
statutory
scheme
is
simply
for
him
to
interpose
an
objection
or
not
to
interpose
an
objection,
that
is
all
the
statute
talks
about.
unknown
speaker
that
his
regulations
were
permissible,
that
is
what
the
georgia
case,
and
i
wrote
the
opinion.
unknown
speaker
when
you
called
it
an
abdication,
would
you
also
agree,
i
take
it
you
would
agree,
that
he
made
an
error
of
law.
