justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
actually,
like
out
issue
here
is
rather
narrow,
or
you
do
not
really
get
to
the
question
of
the
merits
of
his
actions.
it
is
rather
the
narrow
question
whether
his
state
of
reason
for
a
non-objection
was
that
he
was
deferred
to
the
action
of
the
three-judge
court,
wasn’t
it?
so,
there's
only
the
narrow
question
whether
or
not
much
is
reviewable,
that
kind
of
mistake,
if
you
please,
whatever
else
it
is,
not
for
the
merits
of
his
--
why
he
objected
or
not,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
all
the
other
things
that
we
have
been
discussing
with
you
so
far
get
above
and
beyond
that
--
didn't
they.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
want
to
suggest
that
it
is
not
whether
it
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable.
but
it
is
rather
whether,
whether
that
is
judicially
reviewable,
as
a
matter
of
law
his
reliance
on
that
deferral,
difference
rather,
is
a
reason
for
not
objecting.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
did
you
get
that
out
of
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
of
course,
in
fact
there
was
no,
at
this
state,
there
was
no
determination
of
the
district
of
columbia
in
a
three-judge
court...
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
question
really
is
when
he
says
“under
this
standard”
may
he
do
what
he
did,
defer
the
determination
of
the
three-judge
district
court
in
south
carolina,
merely
because
he
thinks
what
they
did
might
have
been
what
the
district
of
columbia's
three-judge
court
would
do.
isn’t
that
what
the
issue
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
to
that
extent
is
reviewable,
his
reliance
on
that
reason
for
non-objection?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
isn’t
that
the
only
question
we
have
to
decide
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
please
do
not
put
it
that
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn’t
that
the
issue
for
us
to
decide
whether
or
not
his
non-objection
based
on
that
ground
is
judicially
reviewable?
