chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
have
to
say
mr.
turner
about
the
argument
advanced
by
your
friends
on
the
other
side
of
the
table?
at
page
27
of
their
briefs,
that
one
of
your
predecessors
testified
before
the
congress,
i
assume
the
judiciary
committee,
asking
for
an
amendment,
first,
to
give
more
time
to
the
attorney
general
under
section
5
and
the
second,
to
provide
for
a
judicial
review.
the
congress
declined
that
invitation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
i
understand
it,
the
essence
of
your
argument
is
that
it
is
reviewable
because
it
was
an
erroneous
determination.
does
that
not
have
something
to
do
with
the
merits?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
makes
one
wonder,
why
we
granted
certiorari?
chief
justice

mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallenberg,
you
have
about
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallenberg,
will
you
pin
point
a
little
more
clearly
for
me.
in
what
perspective
did
the
attorney
general
go
outside
of
the
statutory
authority?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested
the
statute
gives
him
certain
options;
he
took
one
of
them,
didn’t
he...
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.

warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
powell.
