mr.
randall
t.
bell
it
looks
as
though,
i
will
have
to
save
most
of
my
argument
until
then
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
pleases
the
court,
i
think
perhaps
in
the
short
time
i
have
allotted.
i
am
sorry.
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you.
do
you
wish
me
to
proceed
for
five
minutes?
mr.
randall
t.
bell
perhaps
that
time
could
be
most
properly
used
answering
some
questions
that
have
been
posed
while
they
are
fresh
in
the
minds
of
the
court.
we
find
it
very
puzzling
that
the
united
states
is
taking
some
of
the
positions
it
has
taken
here
this
afternoon
because
the
opposite
positions
are
being
taken
in
other
litigation
at
this
time
or
have
been
taken
since
the
harper
case
was
decided.
for
example,
the
question
of
whether
a
mistake
of
law
is
reviewable
was
presented
in
a
case
called
harris
against
the
united
states,
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
district
court.
that
case
is
reported
in
415
federal
supplement
and
the
attorney
general
in
that
case,
which
is
a
post
waller
case,
took
exactly
the
opposite
position.
several
questions
were
raised
as
to
whether
he
has
committed
fundamental
errors
of
law.
among
the
allegations
with
it,
he
had
addressed
himself
to
the
question
of
the
one
person
one
vote
standard
in
a
section
5
review.
it
was
claimed
that
section
5
does
not
authorize
him
to
get
into
the
one
person
one
vote
standard.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
it
involved
the
question
of
his
withdrawing
an
objection
and
the
basic
claim
being
made
by
the
plaintiffs,
mr.
justice
stewart,
was
that
he
had
withdrawn
an
objection
with
no
new
evidence
being
placed
before
him.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
yes.
that
was
the
threshold
question
which
was
presented.
the
attorney
general
said
no,
this
is
not
reviewable.
the
position
we
are
taking
in
this
case,
the
court
found
against
him
in
part
citing
harper
against
levi
and
for
him
in
parts.
but
we
see
no
distinction
between
the
questions
raised
in
harris
and
the
kind
of
question
that
was
raised
in
harper
against
levi.
we
do
see
an
inconsistency
of
position.
now
i
also
understood
mr.
turner
to
say
that
if
an
objection
is
fundamentally
wrong,
an
objection
of
the
opposite
case
from
harper
v.
levi
where
the
attorney
general
said
no
objection.
but
if
an
objection
is
fundamentally
wrong
i
understood
him
to
say
that
yes,
in
that
case
private
parties
could
seek
review
of
that.
now
of
course
the
same
judge
that
ruled
against
the
attorney
general
on
that
issue
in
harper
v.
levi
found
the
other
way
when
that
question
was
presented
in
griffith.
but
beyond
that
in
a
case
called
robinson
v.
potenger,
we
find
that
the
attorney
general
took
the
opposite
position
on
that
as
well.
there
are
some
officials
in
montgomery,
alabama
were
again
raising
some
of
these
questions.
he
said
in
that
case
we
cannot
even
be
made
parties
to
this
suit.
that
is
how
immune
we
are
from
court
review,
much
less
getting
into
these
questions
of
law.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
astonished
that
anyone
could
come
in
to
this
court
and
suggest,
as
we
understood
counsel,
yesterday
to
suggest
first
that
south
carolina
is
deliberately
evading
the
provisions
of
section
5
for
voting
rights
act
in
this
case,
and
second
the
attorney
general
in
1972
did
not
look
at
the
submission
of
our
senate
plan.
we
believe
that
both
of
these
suggestions
are
flatly
contradicted
by
the
record
in
this
case.
it
has
been
said,
that
after
the
objection
was
entered
pursuant
to
the
court
order
in
harper
v.
levi
in
1973,
that
south
carolina
has
continued
to
enforce
its
plan,
rather
than
coming
up
with
a
new
reapportionment
or
submitting
to
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia,
an
action
seeking
a
declared
court
judgment
that
the
plan
is
enforceable.
now,
of
course,
from
1973
until
commencement
of
this
suit,
the
judgment
of
that
district
court
was
in
litigation.
it
was
appealed
by
the
united
states
to
the
court
of
appeals.
judge
green
in
her
district
court
order
specifically
said
that
the
order
was
without
prejudice
to
any
right
of
appeal
on
the
issue,
and
so
we
fail
to
see
how
that
constitutes
bad
faith
or
evasion
on
our
part.
we
feel
also
that
the
record
of
south
carolina’s
compliance
with
the
voting
rights
act,
since
its
inception
should
dispel
the
notion
that
there
is
any
bad
faith
or
evasion
on
our
part
in
this
case.
we
promptly
submitted
this
plan,
we
mailed
it
off
three
days
after
the
governor
signed
it
in
to
law,
which
is,
i
think
is
very
prompt
compliance,
in
1972,
south
carolina
has
always
complied
with
the
voting
rights
act.
we
are
quite
proud
that
we
are
the
only
covered
jurisdiction
and
this
court
has
judicially
noticed
in
perkins
v.
matthews
that
we
are
the
only
covered
jurisdiction
that
is
rigorously
and
faithfully
complied
with
the
section
5
pre-clearance
provision
since
the
beginning.
we
did
so
in
this
case,
the
attorney
general
determined
that
our
submission
was
complete,
which
we
think
was
his
determination
to
make.
we
think,
this
court
clearly
said
that,
in
georgia
v.
united
states,
and
so
we
fail
to
see
where
the
evasion
is
on
our
part.
where
is
our
bad
faith?
in
fact,
we
feel
that
the
record
indicates
the
opposite.
now,
the
record
also
shows
that
the
attorney
general
did
look
at
our
submission.
all
of
the
testimony
in
the
record,
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
record
points
in
that
direction
that
nothing
to
indicate
that
agency
action
was
withheld
which
was
repeatedly
suggested
yesterday.
quite
obviously,
agency
action
was
not
withheld.
the
attorney
general
received
the
submission,
he
reviewed
the
submission,
he
reviewed
the
plan
and
he
acted,
it
is
because
he
acted,
and
not
because
he
failed
to
act,
that
we
have
this
lawsuit.
the
plaintiffs
disagree
with
that
action
but
it
simply
is
not
plausible
to
claim
that
he
did
not
look
at
the
plan
or
did
he
totally
withheld
agency
action,
or
that
he
did
not
review
it
at
all,
so
that
is
not
the
case
we
are
arguing
here,
it
is
a
case
in
which
the
attorney
general
did
receive
the
submission.
if
there
is
any
question
about
that
i
think
it
is
a
dispelled
by
looking
at
the
memorandum
he
filed
with
district
court
a
year
later,
in
which
he
said,
we
have
again
reviewed
this
submission
and
we
find
that
our
decision
there
was
sound.
that
is
the
same
letter
in
which
he
went
on
to
say
that
the
plan
had
a
substantial
racial
effect.
but
he
starts
that
memorandum
by
saying,
we
have
reviewed
all
of
this
again,
that
indicates
that
he
had
reviewed
it
once
before
and
he
said
we
have
reached
the
same
conclusion,
that
that
conclusion
was
sound.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
you
will
find
that
letter
is
on
page
in
the
appendix
starting
at
page
51.
i
am
sorry
that
is
the
objection
letter.
the
memorandum
which
i
am
referring
is
reprinted
in
the
red
brief
in
the
appendix
there,
and
you
will
find
that
begins
on
page
4(a)
of
that
appendix
and
the
language
i
am
referring
to
is
in
the
first
paragraph
of
that
memorandum.
it
says
there,
"we
have
again
examined
our
files
to
determine
whether
the
conclusion
reached,
and
the
reasons
for
that
decision
are
sound,
we
conclude
again
that
they
were".
so
we
think
that
the
record,
the
facts
in
this
case
simply
do
not
support
most
of
the
arguments
that
were
being
made
yesterday
in
that
regard.
it
seems
to
me
that
to
adopt
that
the
position
which
was
urged
before
the
court
yesterday,
is
quite
clearly
going
to
create
significant
problems.
if
the
court
decides
to
review
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
is
permitted,
i
think
yesterday’s
argument
gave
us
a
good
foreshadowing
of
what
is
going
to
happen,
we
are
going
to
have
a
host
of
collateral
issues
being
raised
in
lawsuits
on
this
matter.
all
of
these
will
have
to
be
resolved
in
future
litigation,
i
do
not
think
those
issues
are
right
for
adjudication
in
this
court
today.
they
will
have
to
be
resolved,
in
collateral
suits
in
the
future.
some
of
the
issues
that
were
raised
in
the
questioning
yesterday
are
very
difficult
issues,
who
can
seek
review.
private
parties,
the
submitting
authority,
both.
can
private
parties
seek
review
of
objections
as
well
as
non-objections,
and
i
think
the
difficulty
of
that
question
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
private
parties
in
the
united
states
disagreed
on
it.
mr.
wollenberg
said,
private
parties
can
not.
mr.
turner
said
they
can
if
there
is
some
fundamental
error
that
led
to
the
objection.
that
is
a
difficult
question
which
would
have
to
be
resolved.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
i
think
the
act
itself
does
not
give
a
clear
answer
to
that,
obviously
the
act
says…
mr.
randall
t.
bell
i
think
the
problem,
and
i
think
it
is
a
significant
problem;
there
are
certainly
reasons
why
private
parties
should
be
allowed
in
certain
circumstances
to
litigate
that
issue.
i
think
the
way
that
has
been
handled
so
far
and
it
seems
to
be
something
that
is
acceptable
to
congress,
but
congress
has
not
changed
the
act,
it
is
a
liberal
rule
of
intervention,
now
private
parties
have
intervened...
mr.
randall
t.
bell
you
are
quite
right,
because
you
are
speaking
of
the
case
in
which
he
says
i
enter
no
objection.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
yes,
in
the
case
that
you
are
speaking
of,
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
randall
t.
bell
yes,
i
think
that
the
allen,
the
allen
decision
of
this
court
says
precisely
that,
it
says
once
the
state
has
obtained
successful
pre-clearance
the
only
remedy
parties
have
is
to
bring
the
subsequent
contest
on
the
merits.
there
is
no...
mr.
randall
t.
bell
on
the
merits
on
the
plan,
that
is..
mr.
randall
t.
bell
yes,
on
the
constitution.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
i
think
congress
has
indicated
that
the
constitutional
merits
are
then
to
be
reached.
that
the
purposes
--
mr.
randall
t.
bell
i
think
the
language
in
the
allen
case
is
the
best
indication
of
that.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
i
think
quite
clearly,
it
is.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
well
if
a
have
not,
i
hope
that
i
am
making
it
now.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
yes,
i
think
if
we
look
at
the
scheme
of
section
5
and
see
how
it
relates
to
the
traditional
constitutional
suit,
we
begin
to
get
some
insight
in
to
that
question.
now,
the
reason
section
5
was
enacted,
and
i
think
this
is
quite
clear
is
because
traditional
suits
were
considered
not
to
be
an
adequate
remedy.
but
why
weren’t
they
considered
to
be
an
adequate
remedy,
there
was
a
very
specific
problem
that
congress
was
addressing.
it
was
a
practice
which
they
had
seen
occur
and
in
some
states
in
the
south
on
a
massive
basis
of
undercutting
successful
fifteenth
amendment
litigation,
private
parties
would
have
a
voting
qualification,
stricken
as
unconstitutional
they
would
win
their
case
and
the
state
would
react
by
changing
the
qualifications,
so
that
there
had
to
be
new
litigation.
now
pre-clearance
and
the
suspension
effect
of
section
5
has
taken
care
of
that
problem.
so
that
the
subsequent
contest
on
the
merits,
the
constitutional
contest
now
is
the
effective.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
i
think
that
one
of
my
difficulties
with
your
question
justice
white
is
that
i
do
not
see
decision
of
this
court
that
is
yet
resolved
that
question,
it
is
clear
that
it
is
a
question
that
has
been
on
your
minds.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
has
not
yet
reached
a
resolution
of
that
question.
i
suppose
that
had
court...
mr.
randall
t.
bell
to
my
knowledge,
no
suit
has
been
--
a
substantive
section
5
suit
has
not
been
brought
in
a
local
district
court
when
the
attorney
general
has
not
objected.
another
reason
it's
hard
to
cite
authorities
because
this
case
is
one
of
the
first
cases
in
which
someone
challenged
the
attorney
general’s
non-objection
by
bringing
an
action
other
than
the
subsequent
contest
on
the
merits
provided
in
section
5,
which
we
think
is
the
remedy
that
congress
intended
to
be
available
and
we
think
it
is
an
adequate
remedy
today
because
there
would
be
no
undercutting
of
judgments
which
was
the
problem
that
section
5
was
addressed
to
in
the
past.
i
think,
at
the
time
congress
extended
the
act
in
1975,
there
was
no
decision
of
this
court
which
would
indicate
that
the
substantive
standard
of
section
5
is
clearly
different
from
the
fifteenth
amendment
standard.
some
members
of
the
court
feel
that
the
standard
is
the
same.
the
substantive
standard
both
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
under
section
5,
and
so
i
do
not
think
congress
was
dealing
with
a
situation
of
which
this
court
has
announced
a
clear
rule
that
substantive
section
5
coverage
was
different
from
substantive
constitutional
coverage.
so
that
it
would
have
to
deal
with
that
issue
by
amending
section
5
or
leaving
section
5
the
way
it
is.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
was
the
issue
in
the
beer
case
which
came
after
the
1975
extension,
and
as
i
say,
it
seems
to
me
from
my
reading
of
that
case
that
the
court
had
not
made
up
its
mind
on
the
issue
yet,
and
certainly
it
is
a
difficult
question.
i
think
our
view
would
be
that
congress
has
resolved
that
question
by
saying
“here
is
the
subsequent
suit,
why
would
congress
take
care
to
preserve
that
suit,
if
it
was
not
because
it
foresaw
exactly
the
factual
situation
we
have
here,
private
parties
disagreeing
with
the
non-objection
by
the
attorney
general".
it
seems
to
me
that’s
why
congress
was
careful
to
preserve
that
subsequent
contest
on
the
merits.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
the
subsequent
constitutional
suit,
yes.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
that
is
true,
if
the
substantive
section
5
standard
is
in
effect
only
standard,
whereas
the
constitutional
requirement
is
either
a
purpose
or
a
purpose
and
effect
standard,
which
language
in
the
decisions
in
this
court
would
indicate,
then
there
would
be
a
difference.
it
seems
to
me
though
that
the
question
of
purpose
and
effect
is
often
one
in
which
no
bright
line
can
be
drawn,
and
that
the
attorney
general,
if
that
standard
is
different
clearly
could
object
and
if
he
found
a
clear
discriminatory
effect,
i
think
if
that
standard
is
different
that
that
would
certainly
be
a
possibility
for
him
to
object.
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
situation
we
had
in
this
case,
in
1972.
there
has
been
some
question
as
to
why
he
differed
or
what
was
he
doing
when
he
differed
in
the
south
carolina
case.
what
seems
to
me
that
we
have
to
look
at
the
situation
in
1972.
i
think
the
reasons
are
intensely
factual
in
this
case.
the
attorney
general
was
faced
with
the
situation
in
which
a
previous
plan,
similar
to
the
plan
that
is
now
before
the
court
had
been
objected
to
in
march
of
that
year.
but
the
objection
was
not
based
on
a
reasoned
decision
on
the
merits.
he
said
“i
can
not
make
up
my
mind”,
therefore
under
my
burden
of
proof
standard
in
my
regulations
interpose
objection.
he
said
“we
are
unable
to
reach
a
conclusion”.
that
is
what
he
said
in
march,
to
act
932.
now
when
he
received
act
1205,
the
plan
we
are
talking
about
now,
in
june
the
situation
had
changed.
for
one
thing,
constitutional
court
had
found
that
there
was
no
discriminatory
purpose
behind
that
plan
and
in
fact,
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
had
conceded
that
there
was
no
discriminatory
purpose
behind
the
plan.
so,
he
was
dealing
with
a
situation
in
which
parties
to
that
litigation
had
conceded
that
there
was
no
discriminatory
purpose.
the
court
had
found
no
discriminatory
purpose.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
i
quite
agree
justice
brennan,
but
i
think..
mr.
randall
t.
bell
i
think
that
the
reasons
that
he
did
differ
have
something
to
do
with
whether
we
consider
that
difference,
unreasonable
and
i
am
suggesting
that
in
addition
to
the
fact.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
we
do
not
think
that
when
he
differed
he
was
relying
only
on
that
court
decision,
that
is
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make.
we
do
not
think
that
is
the
only
way.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
okay,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
look
at
his
letter,
if
we
look
at
his
letter,
and
it
is
in
the
appendix.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
no,
that
was
the
memorandum
he
filed
in
the
district
of
columbia
court.
but
if
we
look
at
his
1972
letter,
which
he
said
he
was
referring,
and
i
am
referring
to
page
48
of
the
handbook
(ph),
the
appendix,
and
if
i
might
invite
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
full
paragraph
which
is
at
the
bottom
half
of
that
page.
he
first
says,
“we
think
that
our
function
is
to
do
what
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
would
do”.
“if
this
case
were
presented
to
them
in
a
declaratory
judgment
action”,
that
is
the
first
thing
he
says.
the
second
thing
he
says
is
“under
this
standard
that
is
under
the
standard
of
doing
what
we
think
the
district
court
would
do,
we
feel
constrained
to
differ
to
the
judgment”.
then
he
goes
on
and
explains
that
a
little
bit
more,
it
seems
to
me
that
he
indicates
other
factors
besides
just
the
fact
that
that
judgment
had
been
entered
in
the
constitutional
case.
he
says
also
that
there
is
a
right
of
appeal
to
the
supreme
court.
parties
who
feel
aggrieved
have
a
full
right
to
seek
appellate
review,
he
also
notes
in
the
previous
paragraph
that
he
is
considering
this
under
a
request
for
expedited
consideration
because
the
elections
are
getting
near.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
no,
there
was
not.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
yes
but
we
think
that
issue
is
reviewable.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
right,
i
think
that
what
he
was
saying..
mr.
randall
t.
bell
i
think
that
all
that
you
have
to
decide
is
that
section
5
means
what
it
says
when
it
says
that
if
the..
mr.
randall
t.
bell
okay,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
i
think
yes
it
is,
quite
clearly.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
if
that
were
his
objection
we
would
be
quite
confident
in
coming
to
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
ourselves
if
he
objected
on
that
basis.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
it
would
not
fall
within
the
kind
of
review
being
sought
here.
i
do
not
think
we
would
want
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
what..
mr.
randall
t.
bell
we
think
that
congress
intended
to
preclude
that
kind
of
review.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
yes,
and
we
think
that
if
the
attorney
general
ever
were
to
do
that
justice
stewart,
that
the
remedy
for
that
is
clear.
what
happened
in
1971,
congressional
oversight,
now
if..
mr.
randall
t.
bell
exactly.
now
before
1971
it
is
quite
clear
from
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
congressional
hearings
that
the
attorney
general
was
not
reviewing
many
of
these
submissions.
mr.
turner
said
and
it's
their
position,
we
were
too
busy
with
voting
examiners
and
registrars
down
in
mississippi
to
pay
much
attention
to
pre-clearance
and
it
is
also
clear
that
in
many
cases
he
never
responded
hundreds
of
cases.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
yes.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
non-review
in
that
case.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
we
think
that
proposition
is
not
as
shocking
as
it
seems
on
its
face
because
there
is
congressional
oversight.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
pardon?
mr.
randall
t.
bell
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
georgia,
in
the
georgia
case
this
court
said
that
these
things
are
things
that
are
left
with
the
attorney
general.
we
do
not
have
to
find
that
what
he
did
do
is
the
only
thing
he
could
do
or...
mr.
randall
t.
bell
or
even
the
right
thing.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
that
is
our
argument.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
attorney
general
ever
begins
flagrantly
abusing
that
power
or
doing
something
which
was
clearly,
what
congress
felt
that
it
did
not
want,
congressional
oversight
would
be
the
remedy
for
that
case,
and
not—yes.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
yes,
of
course
that
hypothesis
is
completely
implausible
because
the
act
has
been
very
successful
in
accomplishing
its
purpose.
even
in
all
those
years
that
the
attorney
general
was
not
reviewing
every
submission,
blacks
were
making
great
strides
forward
in
the
south.
mr.
pottinger(ph)
and
others
have
said
in
the
testimony
in
1975,
“this
is
the
most
successful
piece
of
civil
rights
legislation
ever
passed
by
congress
and
so
to
talk
about
this
hypothesis,
i
think
is
implausible
as
a
matter
of
experience,
but
even
in
those
situations,
congressional
oversight
is
available
and
as
you
suggest
it
is
just
public
outrage,
that
kind
of
behavior,
if
it
occurred
certainly..
mr.
randall
t.
bell
under
his
guidelines,
if
he
does
both
of
those
things
within
the
60
day
period,
the
objection
will
stand,
justice
marshall,
and
the
state
could
not
enforce.
i
think
that
is
clear
in
his
guidelines.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
here,
434
days
later
he
entered
an
objection
pursuant
to
court
order.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
precisely
and
we
think
that
is
what
congress
has
said
and
what
this
court
said
in
allen.
congress
knew
that
the
attorney
general
did
not
make
a
reasoned
decision
on
the
merits
in
1975
and
they
did
not
change
the
act.
mr.
turner
suggested
yesterday
that
they
or
i
understood
him
to
suggest
that
they
always
give
reasons,
when
they
make
a
response
but
his
guidelines
say
that
they
do
not.
if
he
fails
to
object
or
says
no
objection
51.20
of
the
guidelines
say
nothing
about
him
giving
reasons.
if
he
objects,
under
the
section
dealing
with
notification
of
decision
to
object,
it
says
that
sub
(a)
that
he
will
give
reasons
there
and
congress
knew
that
the
interpretation
of
section
5
was
that
he
does
not
have
to
give
reasons,
he
does
not
have
to
act.
there's
language
of
this
court
in
the
city
of
richmond
case,
which
indicates
that,
and
the
proponents
placed
that
interpretation
on
it
in
1975,
congress
knew
that’s
what
people
thought
it
meant
and
congress
did
not
change
the
language
of
the
section.
i
do
think,
to
return
to
a
point
that
i
was
addressing
earlier
that
all
kinds
of
questions
will
be
raised
if
this
sort
of
litigation
is
opened
up,
not
just
question
of
who
can
seek
review,
but
the
question
of
whether
venue
is
in
the
district
of
columbia
or
in
local
courts.
whether
14(b)
of
the
act
is
a
limit
on
the
general
venue
provisions
of
the
apa,
indeed
whether
14(b)
requires
a
three-judge
court
in
an
apa
determination,
since
three-judge
courts
are
required
elsewhere.
of
course,
there
was
not
a
three
judge
court
in
harper
v.
levi.
how
soon
must
review
be
sought?
there
was
great
emphasis
placed
on
the
timeliness
of
the
harper
v.
levi
suit,
in
this
case,
but
what
happens
if
people
wait
a
few
months
longer?
all
of
these
are
collateral
questions
that
i
think
would
be
an
enormous
waste
of
judicial
time.
why
not
go
to
the
remedies
congress
has
provided
which
get
to
the
merits
of
these
plans?
either
the
subsequent
contest
by
parties
or
the
declaratory
judgment
action
by
the
state.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
also
to
the
question
of
special
elections
in
1978,
and
just
briefly
of
course,
we
think
the
issue
is
entirely
hypothetical
because
the
district
court
was
correct
in
its
decision.
we
would
note
very
quickly
that
under
the
attorney
general’s
guidelines
were
these
objections
ultimately
to
be
sustained,
we
could
go
before
him
and
ask
him
to
withdraw
it
if
the
facts
of
the
law
have
changed.
we
believe
that
they
have
in
this
case
and
we
would
want
to
see
that
and
also
everyone
admits
that
we
have
the
right
to
come
in
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
and
seek
the
declaratory
judgment.
we
would
like
that
option
left
open.
mr.
randall
t.
bell
the
state,
yes
the
senate.
we
note
that
in
mississippi
and
georgia,
legislators
have
been
allowed
to
serve
out
their
full
terms
even
after
objections
have
been
entered,
or
plans
have
been
struck
down
as
constitutional
and
we
believe
that
good
faith
of
our
senate
entitles
it
to
that
consideration
as
well.
as
i
say,
we
do
basically
consider
that
to
be
hypothetical,
of
course,
our
position
is
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed.
south
carolina
promptly
submitted
its
plan
in
1972
in
full
compliance
with
the
voting
rights
act.
there
was
nothing
else
we
could
have
done
to
comply
more
fully.
the
attorney
general
did
not
object
within
60
days.
section
5
says
that
when
that
happens
the
state
is
entitled
to
enforce
the
plan.
on
these
facts,
we
ask
this
court
to
hold
that
south
carolina
may
enforce
its
plan.
because
congress
said
what
it
meant
in
section
5,
and
section
5
means
exactly
what
it
says,
that
we
can
enforce.
thank
you.
