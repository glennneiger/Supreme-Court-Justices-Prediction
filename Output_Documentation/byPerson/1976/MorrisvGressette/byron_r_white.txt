justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
there
is
no
place
to
intervene,
if
the
attorney
general
does
not
enter
his
objection.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
had
thought
that
rule
--
i
just
assumed,
i
suppose
the
rule
in
the
statute
was
that
private
suits
were
not
permitted.
that
after
the
statute
went
into
effect
that
private
party
was
remitted
to
its
constitutional
remedies.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
some
decisions
that
say
that
once?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
what
merits?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
you
mean
on
the
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
this
statutory
standard
is
more
stringent
than
the
constitutional
standard,
my
question
really
asks
may
a
private
party
bring
a
private
suit
to
enforce
the
statutory
standard.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
should
then
be
reached
but
is
there
some
authority
for
saying
that
congress
did
not
intend
a
private
suit
such
as
i
described?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn’t
that
some
argument
for
suggesting
--
isn’t
that
an
argument
against
allowing
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
would
suppose
you
would
have
made
that
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
if
congress
did
not
intend
to
bar
private
parties
from
bringing
independent
suits
to
enjoin
on
the
basis
of
the
statutory
standard,
it
would
seem
odd
that
it
would
allow
review,
at
the
behest
of
purely
private
parties.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
statute
does
not
say
so
in
so
many
words?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
about
--
have
suits
been
brought
in
district
courts,
have
they
been
dismissed
or
have
they
been
entertained?
