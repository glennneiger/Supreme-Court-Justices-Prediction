justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
also
have
to
announce
to
the
court
the
decision
in
the
case
of
morris
against
gressette
coming
to
us
from
a
three-judge
district
court
in
south
carolina.
this
case
presents
a
rather
technical
issue
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
the
issue
consents
a
scope
of
judicial
review
where
the
attorney
general
failed
to
interpose
under
that
act
a
timely
objection
to
a
reapportionment
change
in
the
laws
of
south
carolina.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
agree
with
the
three-judge
court
that
the
act
does
not
contemplate
the
type
of
judicial
review
that
was
sorted
in
this
case
by
the
appellants.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
is
affirmed.
dissenting
opinions
have
been
filed
by
mr.
justice
brennan,
joined
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
justice
blackmun
also
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
