mr.
turner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
believe
that
the
petitioners
should
prevail
in
this
case
because
the
attorney
general’s
objection
to
act
1205
reapportioning
the
south
carolina
state
senate
was
a
valid
objection
under
the
voting
rights
act.
although,
the
attorney
general
initially
determined
himself
to
be
without
authority
to
express
his
independent
view
that
this
act
deluded
minority
voting
rights
because
of
the
decision
of
a
three-judge
reapportionment
court
in
the
twiggs
case.
the
matter
was
promptly
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
which
ordered
the
attorney
general
to
use
his
own
discretion
and
he
did
so.
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court
confirm
that
the
district
of
columbia
courts
in
harper
were
right
and
that
the
attorney
general’s
deferral
policy
was
wrong.
the
fundamental
question
here
then
is
whether
the
attorney
general's
mistake
of
law
was
properly
and
legally
corrected
by
the
harper
courts.
if
so,
the
objection
stands
and
act
1205
may
not
be
implemented
legally
under
the
act.
if
not,
the
court
below
was
right,
and
its
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
in
the
limited
time
available,
i
would
like
to
address
the
following
issues:
first,
whether
the
voting
rights
act
contemplates
an
independent
review
by
the
attorney
general
of
submitted
legislative
changes.
secondly,
whether
the
voting
rights
act
properly
construed
permits
the
traditional
remedy
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
to
compel
the
exercise
of
administrative
discretion.
and
third,
whether
relief,
such
as
that
granted
by
the
harper
court
would
be
disruptive
to
the
administration
of
the
act.
the
independent
review
is
contemplated
by
the
act
we
argue
because
it
is
inherent
in
the
statutory
scheme
which
congress
has
provided
us.
the
attorney
general
is
a
substitute
or
a
surrogate
for
a
declaratory
judgment
proceeding.
it
is
a
quick
60-day
review
but
it
is
a
review
on
the
merits.
whether
the
change
is
discriminatory,
is
the
issue
for
the
attorney
general.
certainly,
congress
believed
and
had
the
right
to
believe
that
the
attorney
general
would
do
some
reviewing
and
not
merely
look
at
it
or
decide
that
he
was
not
going
to
review
anything.
he
was,
after
all,
given
the
job
to
be
a
surrogate
for
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
turner
there
are
two
comments
there,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
the
proposal
was
for
review
on
the
merit.
here
we
are
talking
about
a
much
more
limited
kind
of
review,
so
i
don’t
think
the
two
proposals
are
parallel.
and
secondly,
congress
rejected
it.
so
it
was
not
passed
that
the
attorney
general’s
decision
on
the
merits
should
be
reviewed.
and
i
again
stress,
it
is
not
what
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case,
we
are
talking
about
very
limited
mandamus
type
review
in
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
turner
it
has
in
this
sense,
your
honor,
that
as
we
advised
this
court
in
the
georgia
litigation,
if
you
recall
that
and
footnote
6
in
that
opinion
sets
forth
how
the
attorney
general
and
the
courts
were
trying
to
accommodate
at
the
intersection
of
reapportionment
litigation
and
section
5
litigation.
and
one
of
the
policies
that
we
expressed
at
that
time
was
one
of
deferral.
in
our
brief
in
that
case,
we
indicated
that
that
policy
of
deferral
was
under
attack
on
the
harper
litigation.
since
then
the
harper
litigation
has
decided
that
that
policy
was
wrong
and
we
were
ordered
to
stop
it
and
this
court
confirmed
that
judgment
in
connor
versus
waller
and
we
now
accept
it.
we
have
always
thought
this
multimember
system
was
dilutive
in
abridge
minority
voting
rights.
we
did
not
express
that
opinion
solely
out
of
deference
to
the
three-judge
court
in
the
twiggs
litigation.
that
deference
turned
out
that
we
were
not
only
wrong,
we
were
dead
wrong.
the
deference
should
have
gone
the
other
way
and
in
waller,
this
court
said
that
district
courts
in
that
situation
should
defer
to
the
attorney
general
until
his
determination
has
been
made.
so
that
it
is
a
basic
mistake
of
law
to
defer,
i
think,
mr.
justice
that
we
are
talking
about
here
and
not
review
of
particular
decisions
made
by
the
attorney
general.
the
record
here
indicates
that
this
is
the
only
case
in
which
the
attorney
general
followed
this
policy
of
deferral.
on
page
31
of
the
appendix,
the
position
of
the
chief
of
the
voting
section
of
the
civil
rights
division
established
that
this
harper
case
or
this
south
carolina
act
1205
is
the
only
one
in
which
that
deferral
policy,
a
very
short
lived
policy
was
followed.
so
the
case
is
one
of
a
kind.
the
voting
rights
act
--
mr.
turner
i
think,
its
importance
and
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
know
why
you
accepted
the
appeal.
but
i
think
it
is
important
to
establish
whether
or
not
there
is
this
limited
kind
of
mandamus
or
arbitrary
and
capricious
review
potential
over
the
attorney
general’s
administration
of
this
act.
the
harper
suit
was
based
on
28
usc
1361
that
was
recited
in
the
complaint
and
then
recited
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
very
unequivocally
gives
the
district
court’s
jurisdiction
to
compel
the
performance
of
official
duties
owed
to
the
plaintiffs.
this
kind
of
action
has
been
described
and
recognized
in
this
courts
opinions
as
“the
familiar
rule
that
a
court
may
exercise
its
equity
powers
or
equivalent
mandamus
powers
to
compel
courts
boards
or
officers
to
act
in
a
manner
with
respect
to
which
they
may
have
jurisdiction
or
authority”,
although,
to
address
your
concern
mr.
chief
justice,
the
court
will
not
assume
control
or
guide
the
exercise
of
that
authority.
that
is
out
of
virginian
railway
company
in
300
u.s.
this
kind
of
review
is
explicitly
recognized
in
the
administrative
procedures
act,
section
7061
which
says
that
the
reviewing
court
shall
compel
agency
action
unlawfully
withheld
and
courts
require,
as
you
know,
convincing
evidence
before
that
kind
of
review
is
withheld.
so
unless
the
voting
rights
act
precludes
such
relief
that
this
rule
ought
to
control
this
case,
in
our
review
and
to
address
the
venue
question,
i
think
14(b),
suggests
strongly
that
this
district
of
columbia
court
was
the
only
proper
venue.
but
we
have
found
nothing
in
either
the
terms
of
the
act
or
its
purpose
with
the
legislative
history
that
indicates
a
view
that
congress
intended
to
foreclose
this
kind
of
limited
review.
it
is
true
that
a
great
amount
of
discretion
is
vested
in
the
attorney
general.
the
distinction
is
that
the
mandamus
compels
him
to
exercise
it
and
does
not
tell
him
how.
mr.
turner
i
know
of
no
precise
authority
or
precedent
on
that
mr.
justice.
the
nearest,
there
has
been
was
an
attempt
by
new
york
legislators
to
come
to
washington
and
seek
relief
from
an
objection,
the
attorney
general
had
entered
and
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia,
in
that
case,
indicated
that
they
had
no
standing
to
seek
such
relief.
that
is
as
close
as
the
hypothetically
posed,
i
think,
has
been
addressed.
mr.
turner
he
does
as
a
matter
of
policy.
he
has
announced
that
policy
in
the
guidelines
the
statute
does
not
require.
mr.
turner
i
think
it
probably
would.
i
am
thinking
of
the
bachowski
type
litigation
where
and
certainly
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
this
kind
of
information
underlying
administrative
rulings
are
available
to
the
public
and
would
regardless
of
whether
the
attorney
general
announced
or
did
not
announce
this
--
mr.
turner
if
that
was
his
independent
judgment
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about
here
because
we
have
--.
mr.
turner
well
that
is
correct
and
he
recalled
that
act
1205
was
preceded
by
act
932.
act
932
has
the
same
features
as
act
1205.
act
932,
the
attorney
general
objected
to
because
there
was
no
intervening
court
decision.
when
there
was
a
court
decision,
and
we
had
gone
down
to
south
carolina
at
the
court’s
invitation
and
told
them
of
our
view
and
told
them
of
the
basis
for
the
objection
and
the
court
rejected
our
views
and
said
that
there
was
not
any
fifteenth
amendment
violation
there.
so
we
were
right
at
the
intersection
that
i
was
trying
to
describe
to
the
chief
justice
where
we
had
to
decide
whether
to
follow
the
court
or
to
try
to
overrule
the
court
and
we
decided
to
try
to
follow
it.
later
under
this
court’s
rules,
the
precedents
and
who
is
to
differ
to
whom
has
been
made
quite
clear.
we
have
no
interest
in
pursuing
the
matter.
mr.
turner
no,
sir.
mr.
turner
if
he
did
nothing
within
the
60
days,
it
depends
why
he
did
nothing.
mr.
turner
the
whole
administrative
practice
under
this
is
to
say
something.
so
it
is
very
hard
for
me
to
cope
with
the
question
that
says
the
attorney
general
stands
mute.
we
have
a
whole
section
that
analyzes
each
one
of
these
things
as
they
come
in
and
reaches
a
determination
on
it.
if
it
fell
in
somebody’s
waste
basket,
on
the
first
day,
that
the
submission
came
in
and
was
never
picked
up
and
the
60
days
expired
it
might
be
a
more
understandable
hypothetical
for
us.
in
that
situation,
i
think
mandamus
would
lie
because
the
attorney
general
had
not
done
the
kind
of
independent
review
that
congress
envisioned
in
the
statute.
and
i
hope
that
that
--
mr.
turner
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
objection
was
made
for
a
very
fundamentally
wrong
reason,
as
we
have
in
this
case,
where
the
attorney
general
mistakenly
thought
himself
without
authority
to
rule.
if
somehow,
a
basic
mistake
such
as
that
resulted
in
an
objection
and
the
person
injured
by
the
attorney
general’s
failure
to
do
his
duty,
i
think
would
have
the
same
kind
of
limited
restricted
review
that
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case.
mr.
turner
i
think
the
normal
rule
of
laches
has
to
apply
here
and
i
can
not
probe
the
outer
limits
of
that
because
this
was
filed
within
30
days
of
even
the
day
the
60
days
expired
that
expired.
mr.
turner
it
is
different
because
of
the
distinction
that
we
see
in
the
cases
dealing
with
mandamus,
where
they
say
the
issue
is
whether
the
discretion
has
been
exercised.
mr.
turner
no,
that
is
what
we
are
saying.
this
is
a
threshold
kind
of
thing.
the
attorney
general
said
i
have
no
discretion
to
review
this
in
effect
because
the
record
--.
mr.
turner
then
i
think
that
is
the
discretion
that
congress
gave
him
and
it
ought
to
sustain.
mr.
turner
if
that
was
shown
i
still
think
that
in
that
case
congress
has
presumed
the
attorney
general
is
going
to
exercise
his
discretion,
he
will
exercise
it
correctly
and
in
those
few
cases
where
he
does
not
exercise
it
correctly
the
constitutional
litigation
is
the
proper
remedy.
mr.
turner
thank
you.
