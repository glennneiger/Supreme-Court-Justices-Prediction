mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
has
spawned
procedural
complexities
but
what
is
at
stake
here
is
not
at
all
complex.
nearly
four
years
ago,
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
objected
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
to
south
carolina
act
1205,
a
1972
enactment
reapportioning
the
south
carolina
state
senate.
that
enactment
included
three
aspects
which
have
been
hallmarks
of
discriminatory
effect
namely,
multimember
districts,
numbered
seats,
and
a
majority
runoff
requirement.
the
attorney
general
found
that
act
number
1205
has
a
clear
and
substantial
racial
effect.
following
the
attorney
general’s
objection,
south
carolina
never
availed
itself
of
the
alternate
pre-clearance
procedure
open
to
it
under
section
5,
namely,
a
declaratory
action
before
a
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia.
instead,
the
state
has
simply
continued
to
give
effect
to
act
1205
without
section
5
clearance
and
it
is
that
situation
for
which
we
seek
regress
here.
the
court
below
having
refused
our
request
for
injunctive
relief
against
continued
enforcement
of
the
statute.
basically,
as
we
see
it,
we
seek
compliance
by
south
carolina
with
the
voting
rights
act.
compliance
which
has
generally
been
forthcoming
in
covered
state.
indeed
south
carolina
itself
complied
with
the
voting
rights
act
in
responding
to
an
objection
by
the
attorney
general
to
its
house
of
representatives
apportionment
plan
and
it
enacted
a
new
plan
which
ultimately
met
with
approval.
so
that
today
the
south
carolina
house
is
apportioned
in
accordance
with
the
law
and
today
in
the
south
carolina
house,
there
are
a
number
of
black
members.
today
in
the
south
carolina
senate,
there
are
no
black
members.
and
the
situation
which
i
have
described
came
about
as
a
result
of
an
error,
a
legal
error
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
in
1972.
he
first
declined
to
object
to
act
1205
not
because
he
thought
the
act
was
valid
but
because
he
thought
he
was
compelled
to
defer
to
a
district
court
judgment
in
south
carolina
sustaining
the
constitutionality
of
act
1205
but
disclaiming
any
intention
to
pass
on
the
validity
of
the
act
under
the
voting
rights
act.
now,
i
have
referred
rather
flatly
to
this
ruling
of
the
attorney
general
as
an
error.
i
do
so
because
it
was
determined
to
be
an
error
in
harper
against
levi
because
the
united
states
has
conceded
the
error
both
in
this
court
and
in
the
court
below.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
you
are
speaking
of
harper
v.
levi.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
the
determination
of
harper
v.
levi
is
not
binding
on
this
court,
your
honor,
but
we
do
suggest,
in
addition
to
arguing
that
the
harper
v.
levi
hearing
was
correct
in
determining
that
the
limited
reviewability
that
took
place
here
was
proper.
we
also
argue
as
an
alternate
ground
that
the
harper
v.
levi
court
having
jurisdiction
to
enter
the
interlocutory
orders
that
it
issued
and
the
attorney
general’s
time
to
object
having
been
told
under
those
interlocutory
orders,
the
objection
of
the
attorney
general
was
a
valid
act
and
if
it
ultimately
would
determine
that
harper
v.
levi
reached
a
wrong
result,
this
would
simply
free
the
attorney
general
to
withdraw
his
objection
but
would
not
nullify
his
objection
not
full
time
on
the
grounds
of
--.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
i
can
answer
that,
it
is
our
position
that
they
were
not
entered
after
the
expiration
of
the
60-day
period.
it
was
the
finding
of
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
that
they
were
not
entered
after
the
expiration
period.
now,
i
am
speaking
now
of
the
preliminary
order
that
was
entered
by
the
district
court
that
extended
the
attorney
general’s
power.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
your
honor,
it
is
our
position
that
it
was
not
entered
after
the
60
days
effectively
began
to
run.
you
will
remember
that
this
court
held
in
the
georgia
case,
that
the
attorney
general’s
regulations
extending
the
beginning
of
the
60-day
period
until
he
had
complete
information
on
the
submission
before
him
was
a
valid
exercise
of
authority
on
his
part.
it
was
our
contention
in
harper
which
was
agreed
to
by
the
district
court
that
the
attorney
general’s
time
for
acting
had
been
extended
by
him
in
connection
with
requesting
additional
submissions
up
to
june
19th,
1972
so
that
when
we
went
before
the
district
court
on
august
10,
1972,
the
60
days
had
not
expired.
we
believe,
if
your
honor
please,
that
that
whole
60-day
question
is
immaterial
to
the
issues
that
are
before
this
court.
but
i
--
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
precisely,
your
honor.
i
was
saying
why
the
attorney
general’s
action
was
an
error
and
i
had
mentioned
it
was
held
to
be
an
error
in
harper
against
levi
and
that
the
united
states
has
now
conceded
both
in
the
court
below
and
in
this
court
that
it
was
an
error.
i
also
add
that
this
court’s
controlling
subsequent
decisions
in
connor
v.
waller
and
most
recently
in
united
states
against
board
of
supervisors
of
warren
county
established,
we
think,
that
if
anything,
the
deferral
should
have
gone
in
the
other
direction.
in
other
words,
the
district
court
in
south
carolina
should
not
have
been
passing
on
the
constitutional
issue
until
the
attorney
general
has
passed
on
the
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
issue.
now
the
court
below
never
reached
this
question.
the
court
below
found
that
the
attorney
general’s
ruling
on
act
1205
was
improperly
reviewed
in
harper
against
levi
and
on
that
premise
it
treated
the
attorney
general’s
definitive
objection
to
the
statute
as
a
nullity.
i
think
the
parties
here
including
the
united
states,
which
is
here
as
amicus,
are
in
agreement
that
the
central
issue
here
is
whether
the
attorney
general’s
initial
determination
--.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
it
appears
on
page
appendix
47
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
as
i
was
indicating,
the
central
issue
here
is
reviewability.
if
the
limited
reviewability
that
we
are
talking
about
here
which
is
not
reviewability
on
the
merits,
is
not
review
of
whether
the
attorney
general
should
have
found
the
act
to
be
objectionable
or
not
but
only
review
of
his
legal
statement
that
he
was
compelled
not
to
enter
his
own
independent
judgment.
if
it
was
reviewable
as
we
contend,
the
united
states
agrees
and
as
harper
and
levi
squarely
held,
then
we
submit
the
sole
basis
of
the
decision
below
is
destroyed.
i
turn
now
to
the
limited
reviewability
issue.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
with
reference
to
your
earlier
question,
the
reason
that
we
regard
the
60
days
as
immaterial
to
the
present
case
is
that
it
is
established
law,
we
think,
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
under
this
court's
decision
in
dunlop
that
and
the
international
harvester
case
which
we
have
quoted
and
cited
in
our
brief
that
“where
there
is
judicial
review,
the
statutory
period
which
is
created
and
imposed
on
an
administrative
agency
for
its
action
is
not
governing
the
court
in
engaging
judicial
review.”
the
present
case
is
a
perfect
example
of
why
that
has
to
be
necessary.
if
the
attorney
general
remains
silent
until
11
o’clock
on
the
night
of
the
60th
day,
there
would
hardly
be
time
for
a
judicial
review.
if
there
is
judicial
review,
then
the
courts
have
uniformly
held
that
the
power
exists
within
a
reasonable
time
after
the
agency
has
committed
the
action
complained
of.
in
this
case,
there
can
be
no
question
of
laches,
obviously,
the
case
was
brought
very
quickly
either
just
before
the
expiration
of
the
60
days,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
or
immediately
after
depending
on
how
you
calculate
the
60
days.
in
either
event,
it
was
brought
in
a
timely
fashion.
the
reviewability,
we
think,
is
essentially
un-debatable.
the
administrative
procedure
act
was
designed
to
fill
the
interstices
in
statutes
which
created
review
but
which
for
some
reason
did
not
create
review
complete
enough
to
deal
with
a
critical
situation.
and
as
the
court
is
well
aware,
there
are
three
well
established
exceptions
stated
in
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
none
of
them
applies
here.
one
of
them
is
where
congress,
in
so
many
words,
has
precluded
judicial
review.
congress
has
simply
said
of
this
particular
action
there
will
be
no
judicial
review.
congress
knows
exactly
how
to
do
that
and
that
congress
remembered
how
to
do
it
in
this
case,
is
established
clearly
by
the
fact
that
it
used
that
kind
of
language
in
section
4
but
did
not
use
it
in
section
5.
a
second
major
area
of
exception
is
where
the
matter
is
committed
to
agency
discretion.
the
action
here
of
the
attorney
general
is
not
in
any
sense
committed
to
agency
discretion.
the
attorney
general’s
own
regulations
recognized
that
he
acts
in
a
quasi-judicial
capacity
that
he
is
in
effect
acting
to
pass
on
a
submission
of
a
covered
state
in
lieu,
if
he
finds
affirmatively,
in
lieu
of
the
three-judge
court.
his
own
regulations
state
that
he
will
apply
the
same
standards
that
the
court
does
and
this
court
reviewed
his
activities
in
that
regard,
in
the
georgia
case
and
made
clear
its
view
that
the
attorney
general
does
not
act
on
a
discretionary
basis.
finally,
there
is
the
recognition
even
by
the
appellees
that
it
is
well
settled.
i
am
referring
to
their
note
68
in
their
brief
at
pages
37
and
38
where
appellees
say
that
the
courts
may
determine
whether
an
official
is
acting
beyond
the
scope
of
his
statutory
authority,
even
in
those
cases
where
they
can
not
review
the
manner
in
which
he
exercises
his
authority.
and
that,
we
suggest
is
what
occurred
here
in
substance.
so
in
some
then
on
the
reviewability
question,
we
submit
that
it
is
clear
that
congress
did
not
preclude
judicial
review.
it
is
clear
that
the
action
involved
was
not
committed
through
agency
discretion.
and
finally,
we
think
it
is
clear
that
there
is
not
an
adequate
remedy
at
law.
appelles
--
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
i
believe,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
that
issue
was
considered
in
the
evers
case
that
the
district
court
held
that
a
failure
to
object
on
the
ground
that
he
was
not
ready
to
decide
whether
to
object
was
not
a
valid
ground
that
it
was
reviewable.
that
this
court
never,
as
a
court,
never
reached
the
issue
because
the
appeal
was
dismissed
for
failure
to
perfect
in
time
or
i
believe
--
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
if,
your
honor
please,
i
think
that
this
court
upholding
in
georgia,
the
attorney
general
extending
his
own
time
beyond
the
60
days
literally
stated
in
the
statute
in
order
to
get
the
full
information
he
needs
already
is
a
somewhat
of
an
“open
sesame”
for
him
to
extend
a
little.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
but
i
think
basically,
if
you
consider
the
purpose
of
this
provision
for
attorney
general
approval
its
provision
for
approval
of
a
routine
statutes
that
do
not
raise
serious
questions,
the
state
always
has
the
opportunity
to
go
to
the
three-judge
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia.
so
that
if
the
attorney
general
for
some
reason
is
not
prepared
to
act
promptly,
the
state
always
has
the
alternative
remedy.
and
there
is
no
suggestion,
i
think,
that
the
attorney
general
ever
has,
or
ever
would
have
used
that
point.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
i
believe
that
to
be
true,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
particular
formulation
in
evers
suggested
that
he
was
not
making
the
decision
one
way
or
the
other
on
the
merits
which
the
district
court
in
evers
thought
he
should
have
made.
i
was
addressing
the
adequacy
of
the
remedy
of
law
or
the
adequacy
of
other
remedies.
the
appellees
and
to
some
degree
the
court
below,
have
made
a
great
deal
of
the
notion
that
really
not
having
the
attorney
general
perform
his
function
really
does
not
damage
anyone
because
section
5
has
preserved
the
rights
of
plaintiffs
to
go
to
three-judge
districts
courts
in
the
state
and
pursue
the
matter
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
so
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
has
cleared
the
statute,
really
does
not
hurt
anyone
and
these
other
remedies
are
adequate.
the
short
answer
to
that,
we
believe
to
be
a
given
rather
eloquently
in
the
amicus
brief
for
the
united
states
in
this
court
which
we
respectfully
adopt
in
that
respect.
and
i
would
say
here
only
that
this
kind
of
a
defense
or
this
kind
of
an
argument
flies
in
the
face
of
the
whole
philosophy
of
the
voting
rights
act,
which
is
adopted
by
congress
and
upheld
by
this
court
in
south
carolina
against
katzenbach.
the
congress
of
the
united
states
did
not
think
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
remedies
that
existed
before
that
and
still
exist
and
were
preserved
in
the
act
were
adequate.
that
is
why
the
voting
rights
act.
the
voting
rights
act
placed
the
burden
on
covered
states,
required
them
to
show
that
their
new
proposed
legislation
would
not
be
discriminatory
in
purpose
or
effect
and
gave
them
an
opportunity
of
getting
that
clearance
either
in
the
district
of
columbia
court
or
with
the
attorney
general.
if
they
can
get
it
with
the
attorney
general
without
his
performing
his
duty
then
we
submit
that
that
destroys
basically
renders
nugatory,
the
whole
essential
structure
of
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
the
plaintiffs
in
harper?
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
i
think
it
is
arguable
and
persuasively
so
on
the
basis
of
legislative
history
as
the
government
has
indicated
in
its
brief,
amicus
in
this
court.
that
under
the
language
of
section
14(b)
of
the
administrative
procedure,
excuse
me,
of
the
voting
rights
act
that
any
challenge
of
this
sort
would
have
to
been
brought
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
yes
and
i
am
not
saying
it
as
a
closed
question.
i
am
saying
that
the
voting
rights
act
section
14(b)
in
indicating
a
venue
directive
for
the
district
of
columbia
might
have
been
deemed
to
be
controlling
had
a
suit
being
brought
to
the
attorney
general
elsewhere
despite
the
administrative
procedure
act.
it
might
have
been
argued
under
the
kind
of
argument
that
prevails
to
some
degree
in
the
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
sanders
v.
califano.
it
might
have
been
argued
that
administrative
procedure
act
does
not
create
substantive
jurisdiction
and
the
substantive
jurisdiction
ordinarily
would
prevail
had
been
limited
by
14(b)
of
the
voting
rights
act.
i
think
it
is
at
least
a
grave
question
as
to
whether
it
could
have
been
brought
anywhere
else
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
quite
clear
that
it
was
highly
appropriate
to
bring
it
here.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
well,
your
honor,
the
symmetry
argument
that
has
been
made
in
the
court
below
and
the
appellees,
i
think
does
not
fit
this
statutory
scheme.
it
is
not
a
symmetrical
statute.
the
complainants
are
not
passing
laws,
the
states
are.
the
covered
states
have
been
found
to
be
in
a
special
category
which
requires
them
to
go
through
procedures
before
they
can
create
a
valid
law
and
they
are
given
choices
of
procedure
that
they
can
go
directly
to
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
or
they
can
come
to
the
attorney
general.
and
in
view
of
the
fact
of
section
5
explicitly
preserves
the
right
of
plaintiffs
to
bring
three-judge
district
court
actions
which
would
be
in
the
state
where
you
get
jurisdiction
of
the
state.
and
indeed,
the
very
case
that
you
have
now
before
you
is
such
a
case.
the
south
carolina
having
elected
to
treat
harper
v.
levi
as
nullity
and
having
continued
to
enforce
the
statute
which
we
say
has
not
been
cleared.
plaintiffs
follow
the
only
remedy
available
to
them
which
was
to
bring
a
suit
in
a
three-judge
district
court
of
south
carolina.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
question
of
whether
the
law
would
go
into
effect
in
the
review
period
might
depend
on
the
procedures
along
the
way.
i
can
conceive
that
--
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
well
i
think,
your
honor,
that
a
court
with
jurisdiction
and
assuming
of
course
that
the
action
is
brought
promptly
because
i
can
not
conceive
that
someone
could
come
along
years
later
and
attempt
to
stop
enforcement.
but
any
court
which
had
jurisdiction
and
which
issued
an
order
extending
the
attorney
general's
time
for
objection,
i
think
would
properly
toll
the
enforceability
of
the
statute.
there
was
no
effort
made
in
the
harper
case
to
stop
the
pending
election.
the
statute
has
in
fact
been
enforced
by
south
carolina,
first
in
the
1972
senate
elections
and
then
in
the
1976.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
we
think,
your
honor,
that
if
there
is
judicial
review
that
it
is
clear
that
there
has
to
be
a
power
in
the
court
to
grant
effective
relief.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
i
think,
your
honor,
that
i
hedged
the
answer
before
by
saying
that
it
would
depend
on
the
procedure
if
no
stay
of
the
act
was
asked
and
if
the
act
had
gone
into
effect
before
the
court
issued
the
order
extending
the
time
for
objection
then
i
assume
that
the
act
would
stay
in
effect
until
the
litigation
was
resolved
or
until
a
state
order
was
issued.
if
the
objection
was
told
while
the
60-day
period
had
not
been
completed,
as
we
contend
was
the
case
here,
then
we
would
agree
that
properly
the
act
should
not
have
been
given
effect
during
that
period.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
i
assume
that
interested
private
parties
--
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
yes,
i
am
informed
that
there
has
been
intervention
of
private
parties
permitted,
for
example,
in
the
richmond
case.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
united
states
is
the
defendant.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
right.
the
attorney
general’s
role
is
the
special
role
created
by
the
statute
in
what
we
think
were
intended
to
be
routine
and
easy
cases
where
the
state
is
saved
the
difficulty
and
burden
of
going
through
a
whole
court
procedure.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
we
think
that
there
are
certain
clear
differences.
perhaps
the
most
significant
difference
is
the
burden
of
proof.
a
state
is
required
to
come
forward
and
to
establish
that
its
law
will
not
be
discriminatory
in
purpose
or
effect.
in
a
fifteenth
amendment
case,
the
plaintiffs
have
the
burden
of
coming
forward
and
establishing
violation
of
at
least
effect
and
possibly
also
purpose.
and
that
difference
in
burden
of
proof
is
a
very,
very
major
difference.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
i
think
that
it
does
your
honor.
yes.
i
think
that
the
voting
rights
act
has
part
of
congress
power
--
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
i
believe
that
it
is
and
i
believe
that
in
upholding
that
act
that
this
court
has
clearly
recognized,
that
congress
had
power
to
implement
the
fifteenth
amendment
by
going
somewhat
beyond.
i
should
like,
if
i
may,
preserve
the
rest
of
time
for
reply.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
if
the
court
please,
i
do
not
find
it
reassuring
that
professor
bell
says
that
great
strides
are
being
made
under
the
voting
rights
act,
because
great
strides
are
not
being
made
with
respect
to
the
south
carolina
senate
which
remains
all
white,
all
of
the
attorney
general
and
the
memorandum
that
professor
bell
keeps
referring
to
that
is
in
appendix
(a)
in
red
brief.
in
that
memorandum,
the
attorney
general
found
that
with
proper
districts
it
would
be
assumed
that
if
there
were
racial
voting
that
blacks
could
elect
four
or
five
members
of
the
state
senate,
and
maybe
progress
elsewhere
in
the
country,
in
georgia
and
in
mississippi
and
indeed
in
the
south
carolina
house
as
a
result
of
orders
of
this
court
or
objections
of
the
attorney
general,
progress
has
been
made.
we
are
here
to
try
to
get
progress
in
the
state
senate
of
south
carolina.
much
has
been
said
about
the
1975
re-enactment
by
congress
of
the
act
and
it
must
have
been
accepting
60
day
limit
and
everything
for
which
professor
bell
has
been
arguing.
professor
bell
overlooks
the
language
in
the
house
that
is
set
forth
in
footnote
42
of
his
brief
at
page
29
where
mr.
representative
edwards,
expressed
great
approval
for
the
harper
and
levi
decision
which
has
just
been
decided
when
congress
was
re-enacting
in
1975.
and
we
have
to
say
i
think
that
congress
in
that
re-enactment
was
thoroughly
aware
of
harper
v.
levi
and
i
want
to
refer
the
court
also
to
the
senate
report
number
94-95
in
94th
congress,
first
session,
page
18,
where
a
reference
also
was
made
to
what
was
then
to
the
reference
to
harper
v.
kleindienst,
and
connor
v.
waller.
so
congress
in
1975,
i
think,
was
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
if
attorney
general
went
completely
out
of
the
statutory
scheme
and
abdicated
his
function
that
some
result
would
be
reached.
a
lot
of
concern
has
been
expressed.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
yes,
your
honor,
but
it
is
settled
under
his
own
regulations
and
this
court's
decision
in
georgia,
that
that
is
to
be
a
considered
decision
like
a
court
would
reach,
and
it
is
not
a
decision
--
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
yes
sir,
i
think
that
the
kind
of
determination
that
the
attorney
general
is
intended
to
make
under
section
5
is
the
kind
of
determination
that
the
attorney
general,
that
would
be
made
by
the
district
of
columbia
court
if
the
case
were
presented
to
it.
and
this
court
in
the
thermtron
case
and
in
dunlop
v.
bachowski
has
made
very
clear
that
where
an
agency
goes
entirely
outside
of
its
statutory
function
that
this
court
will
fashion
a
remedy
without
upsetting
the
statutory
scheme.
a
limited
and
narrow
remedy
and
we
are
asking
in
this
case
only
the
most
narrow
and
limited
remedy
which
was
applied
in
harper
v.
levi
which
was
an
order
to
the
attorney
general
not
to
reach
a
particular
result
but
in
order
to
perform
his
function
and
to
reach
a
decision
that
was
independent,
and
that
is
what
he
did
and
it
was
a
decision
that
was
entirely
negative
to
the
statute
and
he
indicated
that
it
has
been
his
view
for
at
least
a
year,
that
the
statute
was
an
improper
statute.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
well,
your
honor
when
the
attorney
general..
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
in
failing
to
object,
he
took
an
option.
but
just
like
the
district
court
in
the
thermtron
case
which
remanded
a
removed
case
on
a
ground
that
was
not
authorized
in
the
statute.
in
that
same
and
was
mandamus
for
that
despite
statutory
language
and
history
of
non
review
of
remand
decisions.
just
like
that
decision
in
thermtron,
the
case
here
was
that
the
attorney
general
putting
aside
his
own
views
as
to
validity
of
the
statute,
feeling
that
he
was
compelled,
constrained,
to
follow
a
district
court
judgment
which
was
not
on
the
voting
rights
act
which
was
on
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
where
the
burden
of
proof
had
been
on
the
plaintiffs.
and
where
the
district
court
had
disclaimed,
that
it
was
passing
on
section
5
recognizing
that
that
was
a
function
for
the
d.c.
courts
or
the
attorney
general.
he
felt
constrained
to
follow
that.
i
cannot
think
of
a
clearer
case
of
well
intentions
and
good
faith,
no
doubt,
but
a
clearer
case
of
abdication
of
his
clear
function
under
section
5
to
make
a
judgment
under
the
standards
of
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
it
was
an
error
of
law,
your
honor
but
it
was
an
error
of
law
of
kind
and
degree
that
goes
far
beyond
an
ordinary
review
on
the
merits
where
factual
questions
are
taken
into
account
and
statutory
policy.
in
other
words
anything
can
be
called
error
of
law
but
when
the
attorney
general
says
“i
won’t
exercise
my
own
judgment
because
i
can’t,
and
i
can’t
exercise
my
own
judgment
because
the
district
court
reached
a
conclusion
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
while
disclaiming
the
voting
rights
act”.
under
those
circumstances
i
say,
like
in
the
thermtron
case
he
has
abdicated
his
function.
and
like
dunlop
v.
bachowski,
i
think
that
this
court
can
fashion
a
remedy
which
will
not
open
up
the
chamber
of
horrors
that
have
been
suggested
to
your
honors.
not
open
up
general
review,
everyone
coming
in
to
attack
the
attorney
general,
but
after
all
the
purpose
of
section
5,
was
basically
to
place
the
burden
on
the
covered
states
to
demonstrate
that
their
changes
of
electoral
procedures
were
proper
under
the
standards
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
if
the
attorney
general
in
passing
on
that
didn’t
apply
the
standards
of
the
voting
rights
act,
but
applied
a
standard
of
a
district
court
on
the
constitution,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
legitimate
to
call
that
an
abdication
of
function.
