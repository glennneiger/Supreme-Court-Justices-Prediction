mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
frank
goldsmith
jr.
and
i
represent
the
respondent
prisoner
in
this
matter
garry
darrel
allison.
to
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
go
over
several
additional
facts
to
those
which
counsel
for
the
petitioner
had
stated.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
no
sir,
i
was
appointed
at
the
fourth
circuit
level.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
i
agree
that
that
is
an
accurate
transcript
of
the
--
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
well,
i
was
not
present
when
it
was
put
in
the
record.
i
think
mr.
league
is
correct
that
it
was
furnished
as
an
answer
to
the
state’s,
as
an
attachment
to
the
state’s
answer
to
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
i
believe
it
was
certified
to
be
an
accurate
record
by
the
clerk
of
superior
court
of
alamance
county.
i
do
not
have
any
quarrel
with
the
accuracy
of
the
record
it
self.
i
have
a
great
deal
of
quarrel
with
the
sufficiency
of
that
record
as
a
basis
upon
which
the
federal
district
court
could
deny
this
matter
of
hearing
in
this
matter.
i
think
it
must
be
--
this
is
the
only
record.
the
record
actually
occurs
in
this
form,
which
is
reproduced
in
the
appendix
in
page
11.
it
is
a
simple
form
on
which
the
clerk
of
court
merely
records
the
answers.
yes
or
no
answers
to
the
questions
posed
to
the
defendant
by
the
judge.
the
only
question
that
we
are
concerned
with
and
the
only
one
that
could
possibly
have
any
relevance
to
the
issue
of
plea
bargain
and
the
existence
of
a
plea
bargain
in
this
case
is
question
number
11,
“as
his
lister
or
you
lawyer
or
any
policeman,
law
enforcement,
or
law
officer
or
anyone
else
made
any
promise
or
threat
to
you
to
influence
you
to
plea
guilty
in
this
case?”
and
the
only
space
provided
is
for
a
yes
or
no
answer.
there
is
no
space
provided
for
the
terms
of
a
plea
bargain
if
one
existed
and
furthermore,
on
the
reverse
of
the
form,
the
trial
judge
is
required
to
find
because
it
is
printed
on
the
form
that
he
find
that
the
plea
was
entered
voluntarily
and
without
promise
of
leniency.
so,
it
implies
on
the
very
form
itself
under
the
old
and
i
stress
this
is
the
old
north
carolina
procedure,
there
could
have
been
no
planning
of
any
promise
of
leniency.
the
plea
would
have
been
stricken,
and
therefore,
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
suppose
that
a
defendant
would
be
expected
to
answer
“no”
to
those
questions
before
there
has
been
any
promises
or
threats
made
to
induce
him
to
plead
guilty.
i
think
it
is
significant,
the
wording
of
promises
or
threats,
the
two
are
coupled
together
as
though
that
is
in
proprietarily
can
be
expected
to
be
denied
and
i
think
that
is
in
fact
how
the
north
carolina
procedure
was
conducted
during
this
period
of
time,
prior
to
the
fourth
circuit
decisions
and
the
later
legislation
which
changed
our
proceeding.
it
is
not
unreasonable
at
all
to
expect
the
defendant
in
that
situation
to
denote
to
that
question.
this
was
not
simply
matter
of
my
speculation
on
this
part.
there
is
authority
cited
in
our
brief.
there
is
an
authority
in
fact
cited
in
the
petitioner’s
brief
in
this
case
to
support
the
propositions
that
an
answer
like
that
is
routinely
given
and
even
counseled
to
be
given
by
a
defense
attorney
in
order
to
have
a
plea
accepted.
it
has
been
substantiated
i
believe
in
two
articles,
at
least
two
articles
which
include
empirical
research,
introduced
with
judges
and
lawyers.
one
in
the
yale
law
journal,
a
1975
article
by
professor
alschuler,
entitled
“the
defense
attorney’s
role
in
plea
bargaining,”
at
84
yale
law
journal,
1179.
another
one
in
1970,
washington
law
quarterly
at
page
289,
the
trial
judge’s
dissatisfaction
as
to
volunteer
in
his
understanding
of
guilty
pleas
and
both
these
articles
evidence
cited
in
tenant’s
support
what
is
well
known
to
any
practitioner
at
that
time
in
north
carolina,
that
plea
bargains
were
never
disclosed
in
response
to
such
a
question
on
such
a
form.
plea
bargains
were
routinely
made
and
entered
into.
there
was
nothing
improper
about
plea
bargains,
but
they
simply
did
not
ever
appear
on
the
record,
they
were
never
disclosed
in
response
to
that
question.
there
is
another
fact
i
think
is
significant
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
fact
that
this
plea
colloquy
in
the
sentencing
of
the
defendant
occurred
only
37
days
after
this
court’s
decision
in
santobello
and
to
the
extent
of
santobello
legitimized
plea
bargaining
or
was
used
by
the
defense
bar
in
general
as
having
legitimated
plea
bargaining.
then
i
think
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
assume
that
santobello
had
not
had
time
to
take
an
affect
in
north
carolina
and
that
this
plea
bargains
were
not
normally
made
a
part
of
the
record.
i
would
further
point
out
that
the
only
record
of
this
matter,
the
state
of
the
record
now
is
simply
this
sheet
of
paper
and
that
is
simply
not
an
adequate
compliance
with
the
requirement,
not
necessarily
of
townsend
v.
sain,
but
also
of
the
congressional
requirement
that
there
exist
inadequate
record
to
permit
the
view.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
i
certainly
agree
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
that.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
i
think
the
analogy
is
misplaced
primarily
in
the
fact
that
in
the
situation
posed
by
your
honor,
there
has
already
been
a
trial
on
the
merits.
there
has
been
a
bite
of
the
apple
and
opt
in
--
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
i
would
argue
not
that
the
only
thing
that
could
be
--
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
judge
makes
a
determination
generally
that
it
is
a
voluntary
plea.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
am
speaking
of
the
state
court
judge,
but
i
would
submit
that
under
this
prior
procedure,
unlike
the
current
procedure,
the
state
judge
does
not
make
any
determination
or
even
any
inquiry
into
the
existence
of
a
plea
bargain
or
not
and
that
is
the
hearing
which
under
2254,
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute,
that
is
the
claim
that
must
be
determined
in
state
court
at
some
point,
if
a
hearing
of
federal
habeas
corpus
is
to
be
avoided
and
there
has
been
no
such
hearing
in
any
state
court
or
in
any
federal
district
court.
the
criteria
established
by
townsend
v.
sain
incorporated
into
the
statute
by
congress
have
not
been
met.
there
has
been
no
full
and
fair
hearing
pursuant
to
an
adequate
fact
finding
procedure
found
in
material
facts
and
determine
the
issues
tendered
by
the
defendant
to
say
that
at
the
arraignment
itself
the
court
did
all
those
things.
i
think
it
would
be
to
stretch
unrealistically
the
purpose
of
the
arraignment
procedure
under
former
north
carolina
law
and
so
we
submit
that
townsend
far
from
being
authority
for
the
position
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
authority
for
our
opposition,
particularly
in
so
far
it
has
been
incorporated
into
statute.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
on
this
particular
case,
it
has
none
i
would
say
your
honor.
on
the
issue
presented
by
this
case,
i
would
submit
that
it
has
a
great
deal
of
the
potential
impact
because
if
as
this
court
has
previously
said,
if
there
is
a
flushing
out
of
these
claims
at
the
trial
level
and
an
attempt
made
to
resolve
them
there
to
the
extent
that
is
successful,
it
should
be
pure
of
these
claims
arising
on
field
later
on.
but
as
to
mr.
allison’s
own
facts
of
course
that
occurred
prior
to
this
change
and
i
would
submit
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing.
i
think
the
real
issue
here
as
far
as
the
north
carolina
procedure
embodied
in
this
particular
question,
is
full
satisfaction
of
the
requirement
that
there
be
being
an
adequate
state
court
determination
and
we
would
submit
that
that
is
not
the
case.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
i
would
say,
that
today
there
would
be,
certainly
a
fuller
inquiry
under
the
north
carolina
--
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
you
can
your
honor.
i
believe
that
no
matter
what,
the
fullness
of
the
inquiry,
the
course
--
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
i
think—
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
that
is
correct.
i
think
there
are
several
problems
to
townsend.
one
is
there
be
inadequate
fact
finding
procedure.
this
reform
would
take
care
of
that
element
with
townsend’s,
but
there
also
in
townsend
is
a
requirement
that
the
issue
tended
by
the
defendant
actually
had
been
determined
in
the
state
court.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
well,
i
would
submit
that
would
be
a
much
harder
case
if
that
had
happened
--
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
my
only
position
is
that
there
are
not
always
be
a
continuing
availability
of
a
mechanism
for
relief,
which
is
what
the
court
said
in
fontaine
v.
united
states.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
i
think
what
i
would
prefer
is
there
to
be
such
a
mechanism,
because
i
think
that
--
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
think
that
is
probably
right.
i
think
it
could
be
viewed
that
way.
of
course,
we
also
have
the
congressional
statute
condition
of
townsend
v.
sain.
i
do
not
know
when
i
am
going
beyond
the
statute
or
not
and
speculative
on
this
case.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
it
does
not.
i
think
it
incorporates
most
of
the
criteria
of
sain.
it
does
go
beyond
it
in
some
respects.
i
just
simply
think
that
there
are
situations
where
we
might
be
able
to
show
that
he
was
in
fact
coerced
into
entering
his
plea
despite
such
an
inquiry
and
if
he
can
show
that,
i
think
that
would
be
a
much
harder
burden
to
show
and
perhaps
then
a
district
court
judge
would
be
justified
in
requiring
him
to
furnish
some
additional
proof.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
believe
that
to
be
the
fact,
i
think
that
has
been
demonstrated
by
some
empirical
studies
to
have
been
the
fact
at
that
time.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
no
your
honor.
i
would
also
submit
they
did
not.
they
verified
their
answer
to
the
habeas
corpus
petition,
but
it
was
verified,
accepted
by
the
attorney
representing
the
state
in
that
matter.
there
was
no
affidavit
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
the
trial
court
or
the
defense
attorney
or
any
other
witnesses
that
knew
anything
about
the
fact
of
this
particular
matter.
there
is
no
motion
there
for
summary
judgment
and
i
would
admit
that
on
the
issue
of
affidavit
that
in
any
event
it
is
improper
to
resolve
what
is
essentially
a
question
of
credibility
on
the
submission
of
affidavits,
that
is
why
we
–
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
yes
sir
in
the
normal
situation
that
could
have
been
done.
i
think
the
fourth
circuit
found
and
we
submit
that
it
is
correct
to
find
that
to
put
that
burden
on
an
indigent
prisoner
confined
in
a
prison
unit
apart
from
his
co-defendant
from
whom
he
seeks
the
affidavit
is
an
unrealistic
burden.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
that
is
correct,
it
is
unusual.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
although
i
submit
that
his
own
affidavit
would
have
been
sufficient
to
raise
the
issue
of
material
fact
sufficient
to
rebut
the
summary
judgment.
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
proper
to
require
him
to
get
an
affidavit
from
a
possibly
hostile
witness
in
another
prison
unit
upon
penalty
of
having
this
claim
dismissed.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
well,
simply
because
in
the
normal
setting
of
a
plaintiff
in
summary
judgment
procedure
--
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
simply
submit
that
it
is
an
unrealistic
requirement.
this
co-defendant
i
think
--
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
well,
because
this
co-defendant
is
the
one
who
had
changed
his
plea
originally
to
induce
allison
to
plead
guilty.
there
is
evidence
in
the
file
from
letters
from
allison
and
so
on
that
the
co-defendant
was
very
reluctant
to
make
any
statement
at
all
because
he
was
trying
to
get
work
release
privileges
and
other
benefits
in
the
penal
system
and
he
feared
he
may
be
penalized
for
that.
i
think
it
is
simply
not
realistic
for
the
magistrate
to
have
assumed
that
their
interests
were
identical
and
that
this
would
be
a
willing
witness
who
would
willingly
furnish
an
affidavit
for
the
plaintiff,
in
this
case
the
petitioner.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
he
certainly
is
and
of
course
compulsory
process
is
available
to
require
him
to
come
into
to
court
and
be
examined
under
oath
and
cross
examined
by
the
state.
we
feel
that
is
the
way
this
matter
ought
to
be
resolved.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
of
course,
your
honor
that
is
the
statute,
that
is
the
standard
for
federal
motions
to
vacate
so
the
plaintiff
–
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
i
would
submit
that
in
essence
they
are,
they
boil
down
to
the
same
standard
and
that
this
record
would
not
conclusively
show
that
he
is
entitled
to
no
relief
for
the
same
reasons
that
it
is
not
an
adequate
state
court
determination
on
the
merits
of
his
claim.
to
say
that
it
is
conclusive
and
forbid
any
further
attempt
by
and
to
ever
impeach
it,
i
think
it
would
be
simply
be
an
unrealistic
position
in
light
of
the
practicality
of
our
--
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
if
the
word
“promise”
in
the
context
to
the
senate
were
construed
to
admit
the
plea
bargain,
yes
it
would.
we
submit
that
it
was
not
intended
that
way,
it
was
coupled
with
threat
and
that
it
was
not
ever
understood
by
any
party
to
the
proceeding
to
contemplate
the
disclosure
of
plea
bargain.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
on
these
facts
presented
by
this
case,
i
would
respectfully
disagree.
i
would
say
that
where
there
is
a
federal
prisoner
and
this
was
the
only
question
that
was
asked
in
the
rule
11
preceding
that
that
would
not
conclusively
establish
that
no
plea
bargain
had
been
made
and
there
are
i
think
federal
cases
i
know,
federal
cases
cited
in
the
brief
of
both
cites
supporting
that
proposition.
justice
machibroda
was
able
to
bring
his
allegation
despites
its
incredibility.
so
we
submit
that
any
federal
prisoner
who
simply
asks
whether
any
policies
or
threats
made
to
influence
you
to
plead
guilty
is
not
thereby
precluded
from
ever
sorting
that
there
was
a
plea
bargain
and
it
will
cover
plea
bargain.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
it
would
not.
rule
11
of
course
have
been
amended
in
1975,
and
now,
i
think
inquiry
is
made
specifically
in
the
fourth
circuit,
the
rhird
circuit,
the
fifth
circuit,
by
direction
of
those
circuits,
federal
district
judges
are
specifically
required
to
inquire
into
the
matter
of
plea
bargaining
much
as
the
north
carolina
statute
now
requires
that
inquiry
to
be
made.
in
addition,
the
new
federal
rule
11
requires
that
plea
negotiations
be
disclosed
in
open
court
to
the
judge,
he
can
accept
or
reject
them
and
that
they
be
explained
on
the
record.
i
think
that
that
is
a
very
salutary
development
and
to
the
extent
thus
followed
in
federal
courts
and
in
states
like
north
carolina
that
have
their
own
procedure,
these
claims
should
not
rise
anymore.
i
think
it’s
unlikely
that
they
will.
as
i
said,
to
response
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question,
i
think
there
ought
to
be
a
mechanism
where
they
could
--
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
yes
sir,
in
essence.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
yes
sir,
if
he
alleges
coercion
and
alleges
that
he
was
required
to
cover
it
up
for
some
reason.
this
is
a
requirement
established
by
the
fourth
circuit
too
that
there
must
be
allegations
why
he
should
be
permitted
to
contradict
his
earlier
statement
in
the
state
court
and
if
he
makes
those
allegations.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
i
would
say
so
because
it
is
a
question
of
credibility
and
i
think
it
needs
to
be
resolved
by
cross
examination
witnesses.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
that
is
a
possibility
your
honor
and
i
am
not
prepared
an
answer
whether
it
would
on
the
north
carolina
law
or
not.
i
would
urge
that
it
not
be
considered
as
contempt
in
view
of
the
traditional
context
in
which
that
question
is
asked
as
relating
to
any
impropriety,
really
that
is
what
the
question
gets
there,
any
promises
or
threats
to
influence
the
plea.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
deliberately
in
response
to
his
counsel’s
advice,
yes
sir.
that
is
what
he
alleges.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
i
suppose
that
it
might.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
i
suppose
it
would
have.
certainly
your
honor,
if
it
subjected
him
to
anything,
it
ought
to
subject
the
lawyer
for
the
same
penalty.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
in
fact
it
think
mcnally
v.
united
states
in
the
first
circuit,
the
court
did
instruct
or
strongly
suggest
that
disciplinary
proceeding
be
instituted
in
just
such
a
case
against
the
attorney.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
it
is
now
and
it
was
not
then.
the
new
plea
transfer
at
form
requires
the
attorney
to
sign
and
to
make
a
statement
that
he
thinks
that
the
plea
is
voluntary
himself,
it
is
not
nearly
as
detailed
in
disclosure
as
that
required
by
the
defendant
personally.
there
is
no,
usually
no
colloquy
between
the
court
and
the
defense
counsel
except
the
case
of
the
defense
counsel
signing
the
statement.
the
fact
is
how
it
varies.
some
judges
may
inquire
of
counsel
whether
there
is
any
plea
bargain
and
normally
when
that
question
reached
on
today's
form,
whether
there
has
been
any
plea
negotiation
it
is
both
counsel
who
speaks.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
that
is
right
your
honor.
he
did
not,
just
the
defendant
himself.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
it
was
customarily
done
in
open
court.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
the
manner
for
doing
it
in
an
open
court
varied.
sometimes
the
defense
counsel
would
sit
by
the
defendant
and
write
the
answers
into
the
blanks.
sometimes
the
clerk
of
court
could
write
the
answers
into
the
blanks,
very
rarely
if
ever
that
the
defendant
would
actually
write
the
answers,
but
his
oral
answers
would
be
put
down
in
the
appropriate
blank.
it
was
not
an
open
court.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
in
this
particular
case,
yes
sir
and
any
time
that
counsel,
the
client
was
represented
of
course
he
would
be
present.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
the
problem
here
i
think
is
that
there
is
no
record
apart
from
this
form.
we
do
not
have
the
verbatim
transcript
if
one
was
made
of
the
plea
proceeding
and
so
we
do
not
know
what
else
might
have
been
said
by
anyone
at
the
proceeding.
we
have
absolutely
no
record
of
what
happened
at
the
sentencing
three
days
later
and
it
is
conceivable
that
the
defendant
may
have
raised
some
objection
and
we
do
not
know
that
and
that
is
we
submit
should
be
properly
brought
out
as
relating
to
its
credibility
at
a
hearing
and
have
an
inquiry
hearing.
i
submit
that
the
state
of
the
record
presently
is
simply
insufficient
to
ascertain
that
that
was
determined
irrevocably
that
there
would
be
no
plea
bargain.
i
think
one
other
factor
i
want
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
that,
i
did
not
cite
my
brief
and
that
is
the
official
commentary
to
the
north
carolina
general
statutes.
the
statutes
themselves
are
set
out
in
my
brief,
the
ones
that,
the
amendment
to
chapter
15(a)
of
the
north
carolina
criminal
procedure
act
which
required
an
open
court
disclosure
plea
bargains.
i
think
it
is
significant
to
note
the
official
commentary
which
is
reprinted
with
those
statutes
and
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
legitimate
plea
negotiation
and
“to
bring
plea
negotiations
out
of
the
back
room”
and
further,
their
own
the
writers
of
the
official
commentary
say
that
the
purpose
is
now
intended
to
allow
the
defendant
to
tell
the
truth
in
plea
proceedings,
implying
that
perhaps
in
former
times
the
defendant
was
not
always
expected
to
tell
the
truth
in
response
to
that
type
of
question
in
plea
proceedings.
the
same
type
of
comments
that
i
think
were
found
in
the
amendments
to
rule
11(e)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
i
think
it
simply
points
out
that
this
is
a
new
day,
this
is
taking
pleas
out
of
the
dark
ages
and
that
this
plea
arouse
in
the
dark
ages
of
plea
bargaining
when
these
things
were
not
brought
out
in
open
court
and
were
not
explicitly
recognized
as
being
constitutionally
sound.
to
please
the
court
we
submit
that
unless
this
court
can
honestly
say
that
this
procedure
was
a
full
and
fair
hearing
in
fulfillment
of
the
requirement
in
townsend
v.
sain
then
it
is
bound
to
affirm
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
it
must
be
kept
amended.
the
only
relief
sought
is
a
hearing
at
which
witnesses
who
have
not
previously
testified
will
be
able
to
--
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
please
the
court
i
would
like
to
take
just
a
moment
to
explore
the
suggestion
made
that
affidavits
would
be
appropriate
in
this
kind
of
case
if
the
appropriate
procedure
were
followed
that
is
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
i
would
hope
that
the
court
would
not
restrict
those
claims
that
maybe
heard
in
federal
habeas
corpus
to
those
cases
where
the
plea
bargain
is
witnessed
by
some
outside
party.
i
think
that
the
hypothetical
situation
posed
by
mr.
justice
marshall
is
appropriate.
it
is
appropriate
to
ask
that
question,
if
allison
had
not
been
so
fortunate
as
to
have
his
bargain
witnessed
by
his
co-defendant
then
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
try
to
resolve
his
claim
on
the
basis
of
requiring
him
to
submit
further
evidence
of
his
claim
and
that
affidavits
still
don't
go
very
far
towards
resolving
that
type
of
issue
or
it
does
resolve
on
credibility.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
that
is
exactly
right
your
honor.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
that
is
what
i
am
standing
on
and
i
am
stating
further
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
fashion
a
general
requirement
of
other
evidence
of
the
claim
because
there
are
situations
where
maybe
only
the
attorney
and
his
client
discuss
the
plea.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
yes
sir,
they
may
or
he
maybe
called
to
testify
in
the
hearing.
i
think
that
would
be
an
option
with
the
district
court
judge,
but
i
think
some
compulsory
process
must
exist
for
obtaining
his
testimony
and
subjecting
him
to
cross
examination
by
both
parties.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
the
only
explanation
your
honor
that
i
can
offer
is
that,
the
case
did
not
progress
far
enough
to
obtain
such
evidence.
i
think
that
in
any
event
had
an
affidavit
been
obtained
that
might
not
resolved
the
issue
either
because
if
the
affidavit
from
the
defense
counsel
denied
any
suggestion
of
a
plea
bargain,
there
still
remains
the
question
of
credibility
and
i
do
not
think
we
can
be
so
cynical
as
i
said
in
my
brief
to
suppose
that
every
time
there
is
contradiction
between
the
client
and
his
lawyer
that
the
lawyer
is
invariably
right.
as
a
question,
i
think
it
has
to
be
resolved
by
the
trial
or
fact
in
an
evidentiary
hearing
where
credibility
can
be
tested,
but
no
one
to
date
has
approached
as
far
as
i
know,
either
the
defense
lawyer
or
the
persecutor
or
any
other
party
to
the
case
to
ascertain
what
there
version
of
the
facts
is.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
i
think
it
would
go
far
towards
washing
the
problem
out
in
that
the
claims
would
not
be
made
in
the
first
instance
because
they
will
be
flushed
out
and
if
made
the
burden
would
be
hard
to
sustain
i
think
as
to
why
someone
not
to
be
heard
to
contradict
as
earlier
statement
after
full
inquiry.
mr.
c.
frank
goldsmith,
jr.
thank
you
your
honor.
