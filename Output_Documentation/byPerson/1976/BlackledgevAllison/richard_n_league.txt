mr.
richard
n.
league
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
richard
league
from
raleigh,
north
carolina
to
argue
this
case
for
the
petitioners.
this
case
had
hopefully
involves
a
long-shot
in
the
criminal
justice
process,
possibility
of
a
broken
plea
bargain.
the
case
began
back
in
january
of
1972
in
alamance
county,
north
carolina.
at
that
time,
gary
darrell
allison
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
to
a
charge
of
safecracking
or
attempted
safecracking.
in
accordance
with
our
state
procedure,
he
was
examined
to
determine
whether
or
not
his
plea
was
a
voluntary
and
intelligent
act
and
as
part
of
that
proceeding,
he
was
asked
several
questions.
one
of
which
determined
that
he
knew
the
maximum
punishment
for
his
crime.
another
was
designed
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
had
been
any
promises
made
to
him
in
order
to
secure
his
plea.
he
said
that
there
had
been.
at
the
conclusion
of
this
proceeding,
the
trial
judge
accepted
his
plea
and
entered
a
sentence
of
17
to
21
years
for
the
offense.
sometime
after
that,
he
began
post-conviction
proceedings
in
the
state
court
and
ultimately,
in
march
1973
filed
an
application
for
writ
habeas
corpus
with
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
in
north
carolina.
in
that
writ,
he
alleged
that
his
plea
had
been
induced
by
a
promise
of
ten
years
by
his
lawyer.
this
of
course
was
opposite
of
what
he
told
the
trial
judge
and
he
told
him
that
no
promises
had
been
made
to
secure
his
plea.
at
first,
the
district
court
dismissed
the
writ
then
it
reopened
the
case
and
after
some
correspondence
with
the
petitioner
about
substantiating
his
claim,
he
claimed
that
he
had
a
witness
to
his
lawyer’s
offer
to
him
of
this
ten-year
sentence.
the
district
court
again
dismissed
his
claim
for
failure
to
supply
an
affidavit
with
regard
to
this.
on
appeal,
the
fourth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court
and
held
that
a
form
of
inquiry
was
used
addressing
the
accused
to
determine
whether
or
not
any
promises
had
made
and
was
non-reliable
way
to
go
about
this
and
also
condemned
the
district
court’s
attempt
to
have
the
matter
substantiated
by
way
of
affidavit.
we
are
here
before
you
today
to
assert
as
a
central
thrust
of
our
argument
that
the
townsend
v.
sain,
authorized
the
district
court
to
accept
the
state
court
findings
on
this
manner
that
there
were
no
promises
made
for
the
petitioner’s
plea
and
to
adjudicate
this
habeas
corpus
petition
on
the
basis
of
that.
as
far
as
reliability
goes,
there
has
not
been
much
law
developing
in
this
aspect
of
the
decision
in
townsend
v.
sain
or
the
statute
that
declares
the
law
with
regard
to
it.
but
it
was
a
sworn
proceeding
that
somewhat
differentiates
it
from
those
rule
11
enquiries
as
i
understand
them.
it
is
a
proceeding
in
which
the
petitioner
himself
solely
testified.
it
was
also
a
proceeding
that
covered
the
matter
involved
whether
or
not
there
had
been
a
promise
for
his
plea.
with
regard
to
the
attacks
on
this
type
of
enquiry,
i
hope
that
the
court
will
understand
them
to
be
a
largely
matter
folklore
rather
than
fact.
it
developed
from
impressions
made
i
believe
in
the
metropolitan
northeast
in
the
mid
50’s
and
the
early
60’s.
to
some
extent,
they
are
based
on
a
study
done
in
the
midwest
in
the
1950’s.
i
think
a
misinterpretation
to
that
study.
a
gentleman
named
mr.
newman
who
was
frequently
quoted
with
regard
to
the
matter
of
guilty
plea
has
observed
a
series
of
arraignments
at
that
time
and
found
that
in
none
of
them
did
anyone
answered
to
response
about
promises
say
that
the
district
attorney
promised
him
a
sentence.
that
of
course
i
do
not
believe.
it
is
a
remarkable
observation
because
you
would
not
expect
that.
certainly,
you
would
not
expect
it
in
north
carolina.
i
would
say
to
you
that
whatever
validity
that
these
observations
and
attacks
on
this
type
of
proceeding
that
use
had
at
one
time,
they
are
pretty
far
removed
in
time
and
space
from
north
carolina
in
1972,
the
time
of
course,
when
allison
entered
his
plea.
since
that
time
or
between
that
time
10
to
15
years
time
difference
we
had
the
brady
decision
by
this
honorable
court
which
specifically
incorporated
as
the
part
of
the
definition
of
the
volunteer
civically.
knowledge
of
the
actual
value
of
commitments
made
to
an
accused
by
this
day
and
of
course
that
was
picked
up
and
some
of
our
cases,
well
before
allison’s
plea.
one
of
the
reasons
asserted
for
finding
that
the
enquiry
was
not
reliable
made
by
mr.
goldsmith,
was
that
the
word
“promises”
was
the
one
that
was
capable
of
being
narrowly
construed
by
a
lawyer
with
regard
to
his
client
or
in
advising
his
client
and
the
client
would
therefore
say
that
there
were
no
promises
to
him,
and
although
he
was
aware
of
a
deal,
he
would
not
concede
that
as
a
promise.
but
i
believe
that
that
is
incorrect.
i
believe
that
ordinarily,
you
would
expect
a
man
no
matter
how
the
matter
was
phrased,
no
matter
whether
the
word
promise
was
used
to
him
or
not
to
conceive
of
a
deal
as
a
sure
thing.
they
conceive
of
it
in
terms
of
a
promise
whether
or
not
that
word
was
not
used.
also,
another
reason
given
for
not
accepting
the
state’s
proceeding
in
this
case
was
the
fact
that
a
man
might
not
speak
up.
he
might
not
admit
in
court
to
either
there
was
a
bargain
or
that,
after
it
was
breached
that
it
was
breached,
he
would
for
some
reasons
stay
silent.
but
again,
i
would
ask
your
honors
to
recall
that
man
you
are
dealing
with
and
not
especially
assorted
people.
they
were
after
all
the
men
who
will
rob
you
or
kill
you
or
assault
you
and
you
can
certainly
expect
that
a
fair
number
of
them
would
not
speak
up
and
certainly,
we
were
able
to
find
a
few
instances
out
there
and
have
included
them
in
our
brief.
with
regard
to
this
particular
matter,
i
think
that
if
the
court
were
to
depart
from
townsend
v.
sain
and
were
not
to
allow
the
district
court
to
accept
state
court
findings
in
this
context
but
significantly
undercut
one
of
the
basic
reasons
for
two
of
its
subsequent
cases,
in
mccarthy
case
and
the
boykin
case,
certainly,
one
of
the
hopes
behind
each
of
those
cases
was
to
cut
down
post
conviction
work
or
to
expeditiously
handle
it.
other
courts
go
by
the
board
and
do
so
for
a
type
of
claim
that
i
do
not
think
that
a
lot
of
people
give
much
credence
to.
in
machibroda
of
the
united
states,
this
court
did
not
describe
this
type
of
claim
in
very
high
terms.
the
courts
of
appeal
who
have
looked
at
it
and
a
number
of
them
are
even
in
remand
for
hearing
have
indicated
that
they
did
not
think
that
it
was
very
high
likelihood
of
the
success
with
regard
to
the
matter
below,
at
least
from
the
petitioner’s
point
of
view.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
your
honor,
largely
unless
they
can
come
forth
with
some
evidence,
that
is
our
position
and
that
is
comprehended
by
the
townsend
v.
sain.
mr.
richard
n.
league
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes
sir.
give
some
substantial
indication
of
it.
mr.
richard
n.
league
well,
in
any
other
case,
it
might
be
where
he
claimed
that
he
had
a
new
witness.
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
the
standard
way
of
doing
it.
something
that
was
not
developed,
previously,
something
that
was
not
before
the
court.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes
sir,
but
he
failed
to
come
across
with
any
indicia
of
it
as
directed
by
the
district
court.
mr.
richard
n.
league
indicia
of
proof,
of
course
at
hearing
he
could
introduce
the
-
mr.
richard
n.
league
i
believe
the
townsend
v.
sain
supports
that
genre.
mr.
richard
n.
league
i
still
believe
is
—
mr.
richard
n.
league
as
language
in
that
case
your
honor
about
—
mr.
richard
n.
league
i
do
not
believe
that
santobello
comprehended
the
situation
that
we
have.
mr.
richard
n.
league
it
just
does
not
deal
with
the
matter
of
him
contradicting
what
he
said
under
oath
on
the
basis
of
the
state
court
finding.
mr.
richard
n.
league
fontaine
is
a
case,
your
honor,
where
indicia
of
new
evidence
was
demonstrated.
mr.
richard
n.
league
ultimately,
to
prove
his
case
he
would
have.
mr.
richard
n.
league
a
statement
from
the
witness
your
honor,
under
oath.
mr.
richard
n.
league
that
is
just
an
acceptable
technique
of
the
district
courts.
it
not
mandated,
it
stems
from—
mr.
richard
n.
league
i
would
not
know.
mr.
richard
n.
league
well,
it
is
authorized
by
statute,
your
honor.
i
mean,
i
cannot
isolate
cases
and
tell
you
in
kansas
in
’55
they
did
it
or
new
york
in
‘73
they
did
it.
mr.
richard
n.
league
no
sir,
it
is
in
the
federal
habeas
statute.
mr.
richard
n.
league
no
sir,
it
is
that
you
can
use
affidavits.
mr.
richard
n.
league
no
sir,
i
have
relied
on
townsend
v.
sain
for
the
probability
and
not
for
the
allowance
of
the
district
court
to
utilize
this
method,
a
newly
discovered
aspect
part
of
that
case.
mr.
richard
n.
league
well,
it
is
newly
discovered
in
the
sense
of
that
case.
mr.
richard
n.
league
if
he
just
said
that?
mr.
richard
n.
league
without
any
prior
finding
in
state
court?
mr.
richard
n.
league
as
a
lawyer
i
am
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
he
had
a
prior
hearing,
no
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
no
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
because
the
state
had
determined
it
and
the
district
court
could
use
state’s
time.
mr.
richard
n.
league
sir?
mr.
richard
n.
league
and
what
point
of?
mr.
richard
n.
league
well,
they
could
have
dismissed
it
out
of
hand
or
they
could
have
required
us
show
cause
because
they
would
not
had
the
state
finding
without
asking
to
show
cause.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes
sir,
it
happened
in
one
case.
mr.
richard
n.
league
that
would
be
an
acceptable
analogy.
your
honor,
i
thought
i
would
really
in
terms
of
a
hearing
without
the
witness
present,
a
hearing
on
the
basis
of
records
alone
it
is
sometimes
described
as
a
hearing
though
it
is
not
the
hearing
in
the
same
sense
that
you
have
to
line-up
testimony.
i
believe
that
in
some
of
the
decisions
on
this
court,
a
hearing
has
also
been
described
in
terms
of
a
review
without
live
witnesses,
perhaps
the
earlier
habeas
hearings.
mr.
richard
n.
league
i
believe
it
is,
it
is
based
in
there.
in
part
like
you
say
your
honor
on
the
townsend
v.
sain
situation
where
a
matter
that
has
been
determined
once
before,
maybe
reopened
if
there
is
an
offer
of
new
discovered
evidence
in
a
broader
sense
than
that.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes.
mr.
richard
n.
league
no,
i
cannot.
i
would
speak
just
a
little
bit
further
your
honor
in
that
regard.
of
course
the
man
did
file
a
small
suit
here
in
advance.
the
question
was
whether
or
not
a
prior
determination
should
have
been
overthrown
or
at
least
reexamined
and
in
common
to
that
determination,
there
was
a
claim
of
new
evidence
in
a
broader
sense
and
that
somewhat
used
in
several
terms
the
judge
merely
said,
let
us
see
it
in
advance.
i
think
he
had
that
discretion.
i
think
that
it
was
invested
in
him
by
townsend
v.
sain
or
at
least
i
hope
it
was.
in
a
somewhat
comparable
situation,
it
has
been
developed
by
the
congress
with
regard
to
habeas
generally
an
authorization
to
allow
affidavits
on
the
merits.
conceivably,
the
judge
could
call
affidavits
from
all
parties
and
decide
the
case
on
that
basis.
mr.
richard
n.
league
no,
he
did
not.
the
one
phase
in
a
previously
–
a
statement
by
any
other
person
contrary
to
what
he
said
in
court
like
it
was
with
regard
to
the
petition.
going
ahead
then
and
in
conclusion
to
my
argument,
i
will
just
say
that
the
district
court’s
discretion
in
this
type
of
case,
i
do
not
think
has
any
less
advice
than
any
other.
certainly
the
district
courts
have
practiced
with
some
of
these
men.
they
had
them
practice
before
them.
some
of
the
judges
have
been
men
that
they
practiced
under,
and
they
are
able
pretty
much
to
decide
whether
or
not
a
proceeding
is
reliable
and
hold
a
party
because
of
the
way
it
is
conducted
in
that
area,
because
of
the
prejudices
of
the
judges
about
certain
things
or
because
parties
are
a
little
bit
slick.
i
necessarily
would
not
think.
mr.
richard
n.
league
not
on
direct
review,
no
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
no
sir.
in
the
collateral,
when
he
attacked
it
collaterally,
of
course
he
fully
exhausted
by—
mr.
richard
n.
league
it
was
filed
by
me
in
response
as
an
exhibit
with
my
plea.
mr.
richard
n.
league
the
indictment
to
transcript
and
the
commitment
as
i
recall.
mr.
richard
n.
league
no
sir,
it
incorporated
by
this
other
answer
done
by
another
lawyer
previously
that
the
matter
has
been
adjudicated.
that
was
their
sole
defense.
mr.
richard
n.
league
no
sir,
the
matter
of
promises
for
a
plea.
mr.
richard
n.
league
should
not
be
reexamined.
i
think
it
is
the
thrust
of
a
--
i
believe
it
is
mr.
haskell
that
did
that
answer.
i
would
go
ahead
if
there
were
no
further
questions
from
the
court
and
let
that
be
my
argument.
thank
you
very
much
for
your
consideration.
mr.
richard
n.
league
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
n.
league
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
richard
n.
league
well,
the
petitioner
did.
mr.
richard
n.
league
the
petitioner
did
get
a
hearing
and
of
course
we
put
forth
our
position
on
it.
mr.
richard
n.
league
no
sir,
i
am
not
sure,
but
i
can
speculate
with
a
fair
degree
of
accuracy.
mr.
richard
n.
league
as
a
matter
of
record,
only
on
the
basis
of
what
the
petitioner
said,
you
know
it
from
that.
he
said
no
promises
were
made
too
him.
mr.
richard
n.
league
that
is
right.
mr.
richard
n.
league
not
without
a
substantial
show
in
new
evidence
prior
to
getting
a
hearing.
mr.
richard
n.
league
like
an
affidavit
from
the
witness
that
he
claimed
he
had.
mr.
richard
n.
league
he
is
out
of
luck.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes
sir.
now,
i
did
suggest
that
some
form
of
this
proof
might
not
entitle
under
relief
as
it
is
just
between
him
and
his
lawyer,
but
that
is
not
presently
developed.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
thank
you.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes
sir,
i
would
make
a
couple
of
comments
in
rebuttal
if
i
might
with
regard
to
the
new
procedure,
the
expanded
inquiry.
i
can
speak
of
personal
knowledge
as
to
whether
or
not
that
is
stayed
in
the
post
conviction
applications
on
the
basis
of
this
type
of
claim.
it
has
not.
maybe
this
made
them
somewhat
easier
to
deal
with,
but
that
is
speculative
too
at
this
time.
with
regard
to
the
question
mr.
justice
stevens
posed
about
the
absence
of
an
affidavit
from
the
attorney
or
from
the
district
attorney
in
this
case,
at
the
time
this
case
came
through,
the
case
was
handled
to
the
extent
it
needed
be
handled
except
in
the
charlotte
division
of
the
western
district.
the
matters
where
routinely
dismissed
on
the
basis
of
a
showing
by
the
state
that
this
transcript
of
plea
had
been
going
into
or
rather
the
inquiries
made
in
the
transcript
to
going
into
and
the
man
that
said
that
no
promises
were
made
for
him.
to
the
candidate
it
was
not
an
act,
it
was
not
expressed,
the
dismissals
were
not
expressed
in
terms
of
taking
a
state
court
finding.
i
think
they
were
expressed
more
in
terms
of
being
blatant
or
lacking
sufficient
credibility
to
cause
the
court
to
move.
that
is
the
basis
for
that.
certainly,
i
had
the
foresight
to
know
i
would
be
here
today
the
case
would
be
handled
quit
a
bit
differently.
with
regard
to
the
matter
of
the
form
that
was
used,
the
fact
that
it
had
no
place
to
include
on
it
any
promises
that
had
been
made,
of
course
that
form
was
not
a
maximum
inquiry
form
it
was
a
minimum
inquiry.
you
see,
the
forms
coming
through
attached
to
writs
sometimes,
a
question
which
dictates
it,
and
more
questions
were
asked
by
the
judge
and
at
that
time
you
get
a
verbatim
transcript,
assuming
one
is
available
as
it
usually
is,
but
unfortunately
it
was
not
in
this
case.
frequently,
you
see,
an
answer
to
the
question
is
yes.
are
you
under
the
influence
of
any
alcohol,
drugs,
or
medicine?
of
course
the
inquire
proceeds
is
just
what
you
are
under
the
influence
of
what
turns
out
to
be
a
tranquilizer
or
some
sort
of
medicine.
that
is
the
typical
example
where
the
inquiry,
the
minimum
inquiry
shown
by
this
transcript
is
expanded
on.
mr.
richard
n.
league
well,
as
it
is
pled
and
as
far
as
we
know
now
that
is
the
fact
involved
according
to
his
allegations,
it
was
just
between
him
and
his
attorney.
of
course,
i
used
it
as
one
of
my
supporting
arguments,
policy
reasons
the
fact
that
there
is
really
no
question
why
that
is
good
enough
to
get
his
plea
overturned
because
it
was
between
him
and
his
attorneys,
it
is
not
the
state
option.
mr.
richard
n.
league
in
effect,
it’s
resistant,
yes.
mr.
richard
n.
league
but
latterly
stopped.
mr.
richard
n.
league
when
it
not
involves
a
state
action.
i
mean,
i
look
back
over
you
honor
and
i
see
that
was
the
glass
or
case
that
in
effective
assistance,
but
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
well,
it
would
not,
but
in
a
case
where
he
had
specifically
denied
what
he
now
says
and
uses
that
as
a
basis
for
his
claim
then
you
get
the
collateral
stopped.
mr.
richard
n.
league
it
depends
on
whether
he
would
misrepresent
that
to
the
judge
on
the
inquiry.
of
course,
if
he
had
not,
he
is
without
fault
and
should
not
be
penalized?
mr.
richard
n.
league
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
the
threats
or
promises
are
length
together,
i
do
not
think
that
is
something
that
you
should
have
such
as
sinister
cast
as
mr.
goldsmith
suggest
in
a
new
form.
there
are
still
linked
together
other
than
the
promises
about
does
anyone
made
any
threats
or
promises
to
you.
i
think
originally
were
joined
because
they
had
the
same
propensity
for
wrong.
there
are
some
things
that
a
man
might
be
considered
or
man
might
consider
a
threat
or
promise
it
would
be
incorrect
and
could
not
be
done
legally.
it
would
be
some
things
he
considers
a
threat
or
a
promise
which
would
be
permissible
later
on.
typically,
he
might
feel
threatened
that
the
state
was
going
to
indict
him.
he
might
feel
coerced
because
his
people
came
around
and
tried
to
talk
to
him
into
pleading
guilty.
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this.
a
man
could
conceive
them
as
a
threat
and
i
think
that
it
is
because
of
the
possibility
that
both
these
things
have
the
same
possibilities
for
affecting
a
play
that
they
were
joined
together.
with
regard
to
plea
bargaining
and
its
non-disclosure
in
the
state
that
is
a
matter
that
varies
throughout
the
state.
i
can
only
speak
for
wake
county
where
i
live;
there
was
no
plea
bargain
until
1971
when
we
got
a
new
da
there,
the
old
one,
supposedly
never
plea
bargained.
as
far
as
judges
not
liking
it
and
that
varied
from
judge
to
judge
and
again
there
is
a
good
reason
why
we
leave
it
to
the
discretion
of
the
district
court.
he
knows
this
and
he
can
evaluate.
that
would
be
my
remarks
in
rebuttal.
thank
you
so
much.
