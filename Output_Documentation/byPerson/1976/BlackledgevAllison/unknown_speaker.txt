unknown
speaker
general
league,
can
i
just
ask
one
question?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
if
the
record
does
contain
a
statement
by
the
defendant
that
no
promises
were
made,
that’s
completely
is
the
end
of
the
matter?
he
may
not
ever
come
in
later
and
say
that
the
reason
he
said
that
was
because
his
lawyer
told
them
to.
unknown
speaker
that
is
before
the
hearing.
unknown
speaker
before
a
hearing,
he
has
to
bring
in
new
evidence.
unknown
speaker
give
me
any
other
case
where
a
man
is
required
to
make
a
valid
allegation
which
if
he
proves
he
will
win
and
he
is
required
to
bring
in
some
affidavit
from
somebody.
unknown
speaker
and
he
just
alleged
that
here,
didn’t
he
allege
that
he
had
a
new
one.
unknown
speaker
he
has
to
bring
him
proof
before
he
gets
a
hearing.
unknown
speaker
what
case
do
you
have
to
support
that?
unknown
speaker
the
townsend
v.
sain
was
an
independent
hearing
in
the
state
court.
unknown
speaker
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
santobello?
are
you
going
to
get
to
that?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
fontaine?
unknown
speaker
did
he
have
to
bring
in
a
witness?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
this,
he
had
to
bring
in
a
witness
before
he
got
his
chance
to
start
to
begin
to
get
ready
to
prove
his
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
where
is
that
that
he
had
to
get
the
--
give
me
a
case
that
said
that
when
you
file
a
pleading
in
the
court,
you
have
to
get
affidavits
from
other
people
before
even
you
can
get
to
hearing.
unknown
speaker
if
it
is
an
acceptable
technique,
where
else
has
it
been
done?
unknown
speaker
how
can
it
be
acceptable
if
it
is
only
been
done
once.
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
north
carolina
legislature
can
legislate
on
federal
habeas?
unknown
speaker
federal
court
statute
says
that
you
have
to
have
an
independent
witness
before
you
can
--
unknown
speaker
if
i
have
an
affidavit,
which
section
is
that?
unknown
speaker
what
is
newly
discovered
here,
this
is?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
he
had
filed
a
case
and
he
said,
i
had
my
lawyer
told
me
and
the
persecutor
and
attorney
told
me
that
i
could
only
get
10
years
and
that
the
judge
had
agreed
to
it,
would
he
have
had
a
hearing?
unknown
speaker
yes
sir.
unknown
speaker
yes
sir.
unknown
speaker
in
this
very
case,
i
am
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
if
this
very
case,
he
had
filed
the
exact
same
paper,
but
he
had
not
said
that
somebody
else
was
a
witness.
would
that
ever
require
a
hearing?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
the
state
did
not
have
to
do
anything.
unknown
speaker
the
state
did
not
have
to
do
anything.
unknown
speaker
just
when
he
files
that,
automatically
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
league
back
up
a
little
bit.
now,
in
the
federal
court
this
is
a
civil
case,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
governed
by
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
even
though
it
arises
in
a
criminal
situation.
unknown
speaker
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
could
the
court
direct
a
pre-trial
hearing
to
explore
the
claims
of
a
plaintiff
in
the
civil
case
before
setting
it
for
trial?
unknown
speaker
are
you
analogizing
what
the
district
judge
did
here
was
to
magistrate
to
what
a
district
judge
can
do
in
a
civil
case,
a
damaged
case
or
any
ordinary
lawsuit
of
breach
of
contract
in
the
way
of
pretrial
exploration
by
the
pretrial
examiner
if
they
have
one
or
by
the
magistrate
if
they
do
not.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
this
is
comparable
to
the
authority
of
the
district
judge
to
require
a
plaintiff
in
a
civil
case
to
produce
documents
in
advance
of
trial
for
purposes
of
expediting
the
trial
when
it
occurs?
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree
that
in
a
criminal
case,
that
distinguished
civil
case,
the
district
judge
would
have
no
right
to
require
the
criminal
defendant
to
make
some
prima
facie
showing
about
his
case,
showing
his
hand
as
if
it
were
in
his
defense
theory.
unknown
speaker
can
you
get
me
the
case
please
where
in
a
civil
case
a
man
was
ordered
to
bring
an
affidavit
of
a
witness
before
he
could
file
his
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
but
he
did
not?
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
procedure
followed
in
this
case?
as
i
understand
there
was
an
appeal
to
the
appellate
court
in
the
state
system,
was
there
not?
unknown
speaker
no
appeal
on
direct
review?
unknown
speaker
in
the
state
post
conviction
proceeding,
there
was
collateral
attack
and
an
appeal
from
that.
but
in
the
appendix
that
you
have
filed,
on
page
11
there
is
a
transcript
of
the
plea
in
the
alamance
county
superior
court.
how
did
that
get
into
record?
i
am
just
curious.
was
that
an
exhibit
to
your
motion
to
dismiss
or
how
did
it
get
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
it
is
part
of
your
answer
to
the
indictment.
unknown
speaker
i
see
because
your
answer
as
i
read
it
does
not
actually
make
the
point
that
seems
to
be
involved
now.
unknown
speaker
that
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
was
adjudicated?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
i
would
just
like
to
ask
you
one
question
about
santobello.
i
am
not
sure
i
am
too
clear
on
factual
situation
there.
was
it
correct
that
in
santobello
there
was
no
dispute
about
the
fact
that
one
of
the
assistant
persecutors
had
made
some
representations,
which
he
had
not
communicated
to
the
other
assistant
persecutor,
who
then
in
turn
did
not
disclose
them
to
he
court.
so
that
there
was
no
dispute
over
the
factual
situation
as
we
have
here.
unknown
speaker
but
you
could
not
bring
it
out
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
you
could
not
bring
that
out
in
this
case
because
you
did
not
get
it
in
here.
unknown
speaker
petitioner
got
a
hearing?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
do
not
know
what
would
have
come
out
if
there
had
been
a
hearing
do
you?
unknown
speaker
we
do
not
know
what
the
prosecutor
did,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
what
he
said
in
court?
unknown
speaker
so
now,
if
it
was
a
matter
of
fact
that
it
was
all
true,
the
fact
that
he
did
say
it
in
court
and
was
told
to
say
it,
he
could
never
bring
that
up?
unknown
speaker
like
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
there
is
no
witness
there
but
him.
unknown
speaker
he
is
out
of
luck?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
only
issue
here
is
that
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
hearing,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
sole,
single
issue
at
this
point.
unknown
speaker
whether
he
gets
a
hearing,
depends
upon
whether
he
can
meet
the
statutory
standards,
which
the
judge
appears
to
have
tried
to
apply
here
that
on
the
face
of
the
record,
it
appears
conclusively
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
relief.
unknown
speaker
now,
the
face
of
the
record,
was
the
record
that
the
judge,
the
federal
judge
referred
to,
the
record
in
the
state
court
on
his
guilty
plea?
unknown
speaker
mr.
goldsmith,
were
you
in
this
at
the
trial
level?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
agree
that
that
record
that
got
in
there
about
that
plea,
but
how
it
did
got
into
the
record?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
how
did
it
get
in
the
record?
do
you
not
know?
unknown
speaker
let
me
go
back
to
the
question
that
i
put
to
your
friend
for
the
state.
in
a
civil
case,
not
a
habeas
corpus
civil
case,
but
any
kind
of
a
civil
case
which
is
then
tried,
gone
to
judgment
whether
by
the
jury
or
the
judges,
the
sole
fact
finder
and
the
loosing
party
comes
in
with
a
motion
for
new
trial
on
the
grounds
of
newly
discovered
evidence,
would
it
be
appropriate
for
the
district
judge
to
require
the
moving
party
seeking
a
new
trial
on
these
grounds
to
state
what
that
newly
discovered
evidence
is
before
he
determines
whether
he
is
going
to
go
how
the
judge
is
going
to
proceed
with
it?
unknown
speaker
now,
i
take
it
that
your
friend
was
analogizing
that
situation
to
this,
whether
it
is
or
not,
so,
you
may
disagree,
where
do
you
think
the
analogy
is
faulty?
unknown
speaker
has
there
not
been
a
determination
as
distinguished
the
trial
on
the
merits
on
the
submission
of
the
guilty
plea?
unknown
speaker
how
could
the
judge
accept
the
guilty
plea
if
he
did
not
make
a
determination
on
the
merits
of
the
plea?
unknown
speaker
we
are
speaking
now
of
course
of
the
state
court
judge.
unknown
speaker
what
if
any
impact
does
the
new
north
carolina
statute
has
on
this
case?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
it
is
just
a
special
situation
in
this
particular
case
and
cases
like
them
or
could
the
day
there
will
be
an
adequate
inquiry
at
the
time
of
the
accepting
the
plea
so
that
there
would
no
need
for
a
hearing
when
later
habeas
corpus
is
brought.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
did
not
what
asked
you.
i
just
asked
you,
can
you
make
an
inquiry
and
have
a
determination
at
the
time
of
accepting
the
plea
that
would
insolate
the
plea
against
the
habeas
corpus
attack?
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
not
like
to
put
a
number
five
on
townsend
v.
sain
or
seven
or
eight
and
another
situation
in
which
hearing
would
be
required.
unknown
speaker
in
taking
this
position,
are
you
not
going
beyond
sain?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
the
statute
goes
beyond
sain?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
this
case
is
different
in
any
event
because
at
the
time
everybody
had
the
notion
that
you
should
not
confess
to
plea
bargains
in
open
court?
unknown
speaker
mr.
goldsmith,
can
i
just
ask
one
question
analogizing
this
to
a
normal
civil
case.
did
the
state
file
anything
comparable
to
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
supported
by
any
affidavit
in
this
case
denying
a
plea
bargain?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
by
filing
an
affidavit
the
state
could
have
put
the
burden
on
the
plaintiff
to
come
forward
with
a
countervailing
affidavit?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
do
not
think
the
fact
that
indigency
would
make
any
difference
if
the
state
had
filed
its
own
affidavits
which
would
require
response
in
the
normal
summary
judgment
procedure,
but
here
as
i
understand
that
the
wrinkle
here
is
that
the
state
did
not
file
the
motion
for
summary
for
judgment,
they
rather
said
that
you
have
got
deny
in
advance
which
is
of
course
an
unusual
practice.
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
not
question
the
fact
that
if
the
state
had
filed
an
appropriate
motion
for
summary
judgment
supported
by
appropriate
affidavits,
then
your
client
would
have
had
the
burden
of
coming
forward
with
the
affidavit,
even
though
indigent
and
difficult
in
all
the
rest
of
it?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
he
is
in
the
position
of
contradicting
a
statement
he
made
in
open
the
court
to
a
judge
in
response
to
a
very
relevant
question,
which
comes
about
as
close
to
perjury
on
his
present
situation
as
you
can
come
without
having
perjury,
you
concede
that,
do
you
not?
unknown
speaker
why
unrealistic?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
is
going
to
have
to
furnish
something
someday
if
you
prevail
on
this
case,
is
he
not?
unknown
speaker
taking
the
statute,
the
federal
statute
on
its
literal
meaning,
would
you
say
that
on
the
face
of
the
record,
bear
in
mind
the
implications
of
that
term,
those
terms,
on
the
face
of
the
record
that
conclusively
appeared
that
the
petitioner
was
entitled
to
no
relief?
unknown
speaker
that
is
why
i
am
emphasized
for
the
federal?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
federal
judge
believed
what
this
gentleman
has
stated
to
this
state
court
judge
at
the
sentencing
plea
then
it
wound
conclusively
appear
on
the
face
of
the
record,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
so
i
take
that
you
concede
that
this
has
been
federal
case
purely,
not
state
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
court
or
federal
habeas
corpus
on
a
state
case
that
the
judge
would
have
been
justified
in
saying
that
on
the
face
of
the
record
it
conclusively
appears
is
entitled
to
no
relief
if
the
district
judge
in
so
doing
were
relying
on
the
transcript
of
the
rule
11
hearing?
unknown
speaker
what
else
should
the
federal
district
judge
at
the
sentencing
proceeding
do?
what
should
he
ask
to
comply
with
rule
11
which
you
say,
“this
record
would
not
meet
rule
11
standards?”
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
your
position,
you
could
always
plead
yourself
into
a
hearing,
no
matter
what
happens
in
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
all
he
has
to
do
is
to
say
what
his
own
lawyer
told
him.
unknown
speaker
and
if
the
state
responds
to
petition
with
an
affidavit
as
the
attorney
saying
“no”
and
he
responds
with
his
own
affidavit
saying
“yes”,
hearing,
you
have
to
get
him
before
the
court.
unknown
speaker
probably,
it
is
not
relevant
for
the
disposition
of
this
case
now,
but
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
i
suppose
you
have
a
hearing
and
suppose
you
got
the
relief
you
wanted.
unknown
speaker
and
then
the
matter
proceeded
on
from
there.
would
his
false
statement
to
the
state
court,
district
judge
subject
him
to
some
penalty
for
contempt
of
court
or
possibly
perjury
in
the
state
court
for
having
misled
the
state
judge?
unknown
speaker
you
conceded
if
i
understand
you
correctly
that
he
did
deliberately
mislead
the
state
court
judge
by
a
false
statement?
unknown
speaker
he
deliberately
misled
the
state
court.
what
his
morals
were
at
the
moment
are
irrelevant.
under
north
carolina
law,
would
that
subject
him
do
you
think
to
some
sanction?
unknown
speaker
would
it
also
subject
the
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
depending
on
the
court’s
determination,
he
might
subject
the
lawyer
to
some
disciplinary
proceeding
if
he
found
one
way.
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
found
the
other
way,
he
could
subject
allison
to
some
sanction.
unknown
speaker
mr.
goldsmith,
just
focusing
on
the
lawyer
for
a
moment,
would
you
tell
me
with
respect
to
the
practice
that
prevailed
at
the
time
of
this
plea
and
also
with
respect
to
the
practice
in
north
carolina
today,
was
it
then
or
is
it
now
customary
to
make
any
inquiry
of
counsel
for
the
prosecution
or
counsel
for
the
defense
as
to
whether
there
was
a
plea
bargain?
unknown
speaker
and
at
the
time
of
this
plea,
counsel
did
not
sign
the
form,
did
he?
it
was
just
signed
by
the
--
unknown
speaker
was
the
form
at
that
time
customarily
executed
and
filled
out
in
open
court
or
in
clerk’s
office,
how
was
it
handled?
unknown
speaker
it
was.
unknown
speaker
without
any
representation
by
counsel
as
to
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
a
plea
bargain?
unknown
speaker
but
counsel
was
present
when
this
occurred,
defense
counsel?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
i
got
some
information
from
what
you
have
said
that
the
gentleman
from
whom
he
hoped
to
get
these
statements
is
now
in
prison
somewhere
and
that
it
might
be
difficult
for
him
to
get
an
affidavit,
but
that
he
can
be
compelled
to
testify.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
you
are
standing
on,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
they
may
have
to
take
his
deposition
in
prison
if
you
prevail
in
this
case
in
any
event.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
explanation
in
the
record
counsel
for
the
absence
of
any
affidavit
from
either
attorney?
unknown
speaker
and
your
position
is
that
an
expanded,
there
full
implement
of
the
federal
rule
11
approach
will
wash
this
kind
of
a
problem
out?
unknown
speaker
but
what
if,
what
is
wrong
with
the
habeas
corpus
petition
that
says,
“i
know
that
i
have
pleaded
guilty
and
i
know
i
have
said
there
was
not
any
plea
bargain,
but
i
lied,
i
was
lying
at
that
time.
i
was
making
a
misstatement,
a
false
statement,
but
i
have
made
it
because
my
lawyer
told
me
to?
he
just
told
me
to,
advice
me
that
that
was
the
way
to
do
things
and
maybe
he
is
right
or
wrong,
but
that
is
why
i
did
it”
and
he
attaches
an
affidavit
of
the
attorney
to
that
affect
that
he
did
advice
him
to
say
that
which
was
contrary
to
the
fact.
is
that
this
case?
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
alleged
that
his
lawyer
advised
him,
he
alleged
that
the
lawyer
advised
me
as
follows
and
it
turns
out
that
is
wholly
false
legal
advice
and
that
no
competent
attorney
would
give
that
advice,
but
in
this
habeas
corpus
makes
his
allegations
and
claims
that
there
is
a
counsel
claim,
that
he
was
not
represented
by
competent
counselor.
unknown
speaker
in
effect
the
resistant
counsel.
you
would
not
say
that
that
claim
would
not
deserve
a
hearing,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
even
if
the
—
you
mean
there
is
never?
in
effect,
the
resistant
counsel
claims
are
never
open
on
the
habeas,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
why
is
not
the
guilty
plea
cases
seem
to
indicate
that
perhaps
pleading
guilty
will
close
of
some
issues,
but
ineffective
assistance
the
counsel
is
not
one
of
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
his
lawyer
gives
him
the
advice
and
he
follows
his
attorney’s
advice
and
his
attorney’s
advice
is
completely
out
of
balance,
way
out
of
the
ball
park.
unknown
speaker
okay.
