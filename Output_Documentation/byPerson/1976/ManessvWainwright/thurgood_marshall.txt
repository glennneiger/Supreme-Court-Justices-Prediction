mr.
brummer,
i
have
a
lot
of
trouble
with
these
letters,
they
are
not
in
the
record;
they
are
not
in
the
place.
how
are
they
before
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
are
they
before
us
if
you
are
not
here,
are
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
that,
they
have
admitted
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
did
they
admit
to
these
letters
ought
to
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
see
how
in
the
world
--
your
allegations
mean
something,
but
the
letters
are
different.
the
best
to
have
in
this
record
is
your
version
of
what
the
letters
say.
that
is
the
most
--
that
is
in
this
record.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
care
about
any
rule
at
all,
but
what
i
am
saying
is
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
in
the
record
--
the
letters
are
not
in
the
record,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
are
not
in
the
record.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
we
can
not
consider
them,
can
we?
