mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
take
this
opportunity
to
introduce
albert
g.
caruana,
esquire,
co-counsel
for
petitioner
and
a
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court.
we
are
before
the
court
this
afternoon
on
certiorari
to
review
the
first
decision
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
to
interpret
and
apply
this
court’s
decision
in
chambers
v.
mississippi.
we
urge
this
court
to
reverse
the
court
below.
in
this
case,
the
repeated
application
of
florida’s
voucher
rule
devastated
the
petitioner’s
ability
to
demonstrate
his
innocence.
the
voucher
rule
clearly
serves
no
legitimate
state
interest.
thus,
the
voucher
rule’s
impact
on
the
petitioner’s
rights
to
fair
trial,
confrontation
and
compulsory
process
deprive
the
petitioner
of
due
process
of
law.
this
case
arose
out
of
the
death
of
the
petitioner’s
daughter
as
a
result
of
the
battered
child
syndrome.
the
issue
was,
who
was
responsible?
the
state
charged
the
petitioner.
at
trial,
the
defense
attempted
to
prove,
one,
that
the
petitioner
was
innocent;
and,
two,
that
the
petitioner’s
wife,
linda,
was
probably
responsible
for
the
child’s
death
--
linda,
who
had
been
the
only
other
suspect.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
your
honor,
we
were
not
counsel
for
the
petitioner
at
the
trial;
but
i
think
that
it
was
clear
on
the
record
of
this
case
that
linda
was
adverse
to
this
petitioner
at
the
time
she
was
called
to
the
stand
by
the
defense,
if
that’s
the
direction
of
your
honor’s
question.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
absolutely,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
record
is
very
clear
in
this
regard,
and
there
are
a
number
of
places
in
the
record
where
this
is
so.
first
of
all,
it’s
clear
on
the
record
that
linda
had
been
the
only
other
suspect.
she
had
given
a
statement
to
the
police,
which
tended
to
incriminate
the
petitioner.
she
was
listed
as
a
state’s
witness
on
the
state’s
witness
list.
she
had
been
subpoenaed
to
the
trial
by
the
state
and
brought
to
the
trial
by
the
state
from
texas.
in
his
motion
to
suppress,
the
petitioner
said
that
he
had
confessed
in
order
to
protect
his
wife.
in
opening
statement,
the
defense
said
it
would
show
who
probably
killed
the
child,
and
it
was
not
the
petitioner,
and
that
linda
maness
would
be
the
defense’s
chief
witness.
of
course,
after
linda
took
the
stand
and
she
testified
consistently
with
the
state’s
theory
of
the
case,
any
question
as
to
her
adversity
clearly
was
cleared
up.
there
is
an
immediate
denial
by
linda
that
she
was
guilty.
in
that
there
were
only
two
suspects
here,
if
she
is
not
guilty,
the
petitioner
is.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
we
did
not
expect
her
to
say
that
she
was
guilty,
but
we
felt
that
we
were
entitled
to
a
fair
opportunity
to
present
our
defense
for
consideration
of
the
jury.
the
testimony
that
she
came
out
with
--
that
she
had
been
out
of
the
house
at
the
time
that
the
baby
was
injured,
and
the
baby
had
been
alone
with
the
petitioner
at
that
time
--
was
refuted
by
her
letters,
by
her
statements
to
various
witnesses
who
were
present
to
testify.
we
wanted
from
her
own
mouth
to
explain
before
the
jury
how
she
made
these
statements,
so
the
jury
could
weigh
her
credibility
when
she
testified
that
she
was
not
guilty.
we
also
sought
--
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
your
honor,
the
voucher
rule
was
applied
to
keep
out
numerous
items
of
evidence.
each
time,
the
petitioner
vigorously
attempted
by
every
means
at
his
disposal
to
get
this
evidence
admitted.
with
regard
to
the
letters,
in
particular,
counsel
said,
“this
is
of
utmost
importance
that
we
get
these
letters
into
the
record.
if
i
don’t
know
how
to
do
it,
please
tell
me.”
the
court
would
not
tell
him.
he
then
asked
for
a
recess
so
that
he
could
research
the
law
in
order
to
find
out
how
to
get
those
letters
in.
but
it
was
clear
that
no
matter
how
he
turned
around,
the
court
had
the
answer,
and
the
answer
was
the
voucher
rule.
that
was
the
only
answer
that
the
court
had
for
the
petitioner’s
attempt
to
present
his
side
of
the
story.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
record
is
eminently
clear
the
only
objection
made
to
this
evidence
was
the
voucher
rule.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
was
on
the
voucher
rule.
additionally,
the
fifth
circuit
found
that
evidence
was
excluded
by
the
voucher
rule.
this
appears
at
the
appendix
on
page
227.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
the
letters
were
not,
but
the
petition
reflected
sworn
averment
by
the
petitioner
as
to
the
content
of
those
letters.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
it
seemed
to
me,
and
i
was
counsel
at
that
time
and
co-counsel
at
that
time,
that
it
was
more
effective
to
characterize
those
letters
than
to
introduce
a
number
of
papers
and
that,
if
respondent
had
any
question,
he
could
deny
or
he
could
file
a
motion
to
produce;
if
the
court
had
a
question,
the
court
could
have
requested
the
filing
of
those
letters.
but
neither
the
respondent
nor
the
court
came
forward
with
any
request
for
those
letters.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
respondent
completely
ignored
those
allegations.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
your
honor,
it
was
not
his
characterization
of
those
letters.
those
letters
were
in
the
possession
of
counsel.
they
were
characterized
by
trial
counsel
at
the
time
of
the
trial;
they
were
in
possession
of
counsel
at
the
time
that
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
was
filed;
and
we
read
those
letters
and
characterized
them
ourselves.
it
was
not
the
petitioner’s
characterization.
additionally,
there
was
no
response
from
the
respondent
questioning
our
characterization
of
those
letters.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
there
was
never
any
request
for
an
offer
of
proof,
your
honor.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
no,
they
are
not,
your
honor.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
your
honor,
i
would
not
say
that
we
did
not
make
an
offer
of
proof
at
any
time.
we
did
not
make
an
offer
of
proof
in
the
federal
district
court,
because
the
issue
was
never
raised.
the
question
of
the
availability
of
the
letters
never
came
to
the
fore
until
the
fifth
circuit
mentioned
the
unavailability
of
the
letters
in
its
affirmance
of
the
lower
court.
at
that
time,
we
did
file
a
motion
to
supplement
the
record
with
the
letters.
that
motion
was
denied.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
your
honor,
i
submit
that
the
federal
district
court
accepted
our
averments.
those
averments
regarding
those
letters
are
reflected
in
the
federal
district
court’s
order
of
dismissal.
secondarily,
the
letters
were
but
one
part
of
the
fabric
of
this
case,
which
is
based
on
the
inability
of
the
petitioner
to
cross-examine
linda
maness
and
introduce
various
items
of
evidence,
including
--
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
no,
they
were
not,
your
honor.
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
the
trial
judge
asked
to
view
the
letters.
the
prosecutor
protested
the
letters
are
not
marked
into
evidence.
the
trial
judge
responded,
“i
know
it”,
and
she
proceeded,
in
violation
of
normal
procedure,
to
review
those
letters
and
to
reject
them
on
the
basis
of
the
voucher
rule.
but
the
letters
are
just
one
part
of
the
evidence
which
was
excluded.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
i
believe
the
record
reflects
that
they
were
not
marked
even
for
identification.
the
federal
district
judge
found
that
we
had,
in
fact,
exhausted
our
state
remedies
and
denied
the
petition
on
the
merits.
on
appeal,
the
fifth
circuit
made
certain
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law,
which
we
believe
to
be
erroneous.
the
first
and
foremost
is
that
the
petitioner’s
trial
did
not
violate
the
fundamental
fairness
standard
discussed
by
this
court
in
chambers.
the
court
made
some
contradictory
findings,
and
we
believe
that
they
are
or
should
be
the
focus
of
this
court’s
review
of
the
fifth
circuit’s
decision.
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
the
voucher
rule
undoubtedly
worked
to
the
petitioner’s
detriment
and
that
some
evidence
which
suggested
his
innocence
had
been
excluded.
moreover,
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process
had
been
impaired
due
to
the
petitioner’s
inability
to
cross-examine
linda
maness.
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
he
actually
attempted
to
have
linda
maness
admit
that
she
knew
that
garry
maness,
the
petitioner,
did
not
do
it.
he
was
interrupted
in
mid-question
by
an
objection
based
on
the
voucher
rule,
which
was
sustained
by
the
trial
court.
we
feel
that
the
defendant
had
that
right,
and
this
was
a
crucial
exercise
of
that
right.
regardless
of
the
record,
and
regardless
of
its
own
findings,
the
fifth
circuit
concluded
that
the
extent
to
which
the
voucher
rule
interfered
with
the
right
to
present
a
defense
was
not
sufficient
to
constitute
a
denial
of
fundamental
fairness.
we
believe
there
are
two
bases
on
which
this
decision
is
incorrect.
first,
we
believe
that
the
record
does
reflect
a
violation
of
the
fundamental
fairness
guarantee.
second,
we
believe
that
the
record
reflects
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
guarantees
incorporated
in
the
due
process
clause.
this
lower
threshold
standard,
which
the
fifth
circuit
said
did
not
form
a
part
of
this
court’s
decision
in
chambers,
was
completely
ignored
by
the
fifth
circuit
otherwise
in
its
disposition
of
this
case.
we
submit
that
the
damage
done
to
the
petitioner’s
case
in
this
case
was
a
greater
depravation
than
that
reflected
in
chambers
v.
mississippi.
more
evidence
favorable
to
the
petitioner
was
excluded
in
maness
than
in
chambers.
in
chambers,
the
third
party’s
confession
was
admitted
into
evidence
and
was
before
the
jury
for
the
jury’s
consideration.
chambers
was
restricted
only
in
his
ability
to
cross-examine
the
third-
party
confessor
as
to
his
repudiation
of
that
confession.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
we
do.
under
circumstances
where
there
are
only
two
suspects
and
linda
maness
says
that
the
petitioner
did
not
do
it,
i
submit
that
this
is
as
close
to
a
direct
confession
as
you
can
get.
her
statements
included
references
to
the
fact
that
not
only
that
the
petitioner
did
not
do
it,
but
that
linda
was
not
at
the
store
at
the
time
that
she
had
testified
--
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
the
petitioner
has
based
his
constitutional
claim
on
sixth
amendment
grounds
as
well
as
fundamental
fairness.
on
the
basis
that
the
voucher
rule
had
been
applied
to
sanctify
the
testimony
of
linda
maness,
although
linda
was
clearly
adverse
within
the
definition
of
adverse
set
forth
in
chambers,
the
petitioner
was
unable
to
cross
examine
her
or
to
contradict
her.
this
left
her
denial
of
guilt
intact
before
the
jury.
her
denial
pointed
the
finger
at
the
petitioner
because
he
was
the
only
other
suspect.
the
petitioner
was
also
unable
to
get
linda
to
admit
her
guilt
on
the
stand.
there
was
a
reasonable
prospect
of
doing
this
because
linda
had
previously
made
admissions
against
her
penal
interest
with
regard
to
this
case
on
a
number
of
occasions.
but
defense
counsel
was
unable
to
ask
linda,
whether
she
knew
in
fact
that
the
petitioner
did
not
do
it,
because
the
trial
court
applied
the
voucher
rule
to
preclude
this
enquiry.
even
if
defense
counsel
would
only
have
elicited
from
linda
that
she
had
previously
stated
that
the
petitioner
did
not
do
it,
this
evidence
would
have
had
a
dramatic
impact
upon
the
jury.
this
is
especially
true
in
light
of
the
fact
that
she
had
testified
on
the
stand
that
the
petitioner
was
alone
at
the
time,
along
with
the
baby
at
the
time
that
the
baby
was
injured
and
that
she
had
gone
to
the
store.
it
is
very
important
to
note
that
linda’s
testimony
is
the
only
evidence
which
would
point
the
finger
of
guilt
at
the
petitioner
rather
than
at
linda
except
for
the
confession
given
by
the
petitioner
which
he
recanted
on
the
stand
and
attempted
to
explain
away.
his
inability
to
extract
the
evidence
from
linda
also
hurt
his
ability
to
support
the
recantation
of
his
confession.
under
washington
versus
texas,
the
petitioner
was
entitled
to
use
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
he
had
called
to
the
stand.
the
situation
here
is
very
similar
to
the
situation
that
this
court
condemned
in
davis
versus
alaska.
it
is
a
deprivation
of
the
right
to
confrontation
and
compulsory
process.
if
you
restrict
a
party
to
a
single
question
suggesting
bias
or
interest,
when
an
adverse
witness
answers
with
a
general
denial
and
the
party
is
seeking
to
adduce
relevant
and
material
evidence
which
is
prohibitive
in
his
defense.
such
restriction
deprive
the
petitioner
here
form
revealing
the
falsehood
and
bias
in
linda’s
testimony.
also
it
may
have
appeared
to
the
jury
that
the
defense
was
engaged
in
a
baseless
attack
on
linda
and
this
may
have
hurt
the
petitioner
as
well.
we
would
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
united
states
versus
torres
which
is
based
on
this
court’s
decision
in
chambers.
the
situation
there
paralleled
of
the
situation
in
davis.
we
would
submit
that
the
rights
to
confrontation
and
compulsory
process
are
clearly
applicable
without
regard
to
whether
a
third-party
confession
appears
in
the
record.
we
based
this
submission
on
the
cases
of
washington,
davis
and
torres
in
edition
to
this
court’s
decision
in
chambers.
as
early
as
you
direct
appeal,
the
petitioner
has
argued
that
the
voucher
rule
has
been
applied
to
limit
the
right
of
the
petitioner
to
use
the
testimony
of
linda
and
dana
maness
in
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
principles
set
forth
in
washington
versus
texas.
in
chambers,
this
court
set
forth
a
balancing
test
for
evaluation
of
the
constitutionality
of
a
clash
between
the
sixth
amendment
and
state
evidentiary
rules.
the
two
components
are
the
value
and
validity
of
the
rule
in
question,
and
the
second
is
the
impact
on
the
petitioner’s
ability
to
present
a
defense.
with
regard
to
the
first
component
in
this
case
the
voucher
rule
is
an
irrational
rule.
it
promotes
no
state
interest
whatsoever.
certainly
the
respondent
has
not
come
forward
with
any
defense
or
explanation
of
the
rationale
for
the
rule,
or
the
rationale
for
the
application
of
the
rule
in
this
particular
case.
with
regard
to
the
impact
of
the
rule
on
the
petitioners’
ability
to
present
a
defense,
we
would
refer
this
court
through
the
findings
of
the
court
below
to
the
effect
that
the
voucher
rule
undoubtedly
worked
to
the
detriment
of
the
petitioner,
and
that
some
evidence
suggesting
his
innocence
was
excluded.
it
is
also
important
to
notice
that
the
court
said
that
the
fact
finding
process
had
been
impaired
due
to
the
inability
of
the
petitioner
to
cross-examine
linda
maness.
because
there
is
no
legitimate
state
interest
to
be
a
countervailing
weight
in
the
balancing
test
we
submit
that
in
the
light
of
the
findings
of
the
fifth
circuit,
the
conclusion
is
inexorable,
that
the
record
reflects
a
constitutional
violation
of
the
petitioner’s
right
to
fundamental
fairness,
as
well
as
the
sixth
amendment
guarantees
incorporated
in
the
due
process
clause.
in
conclusion
i
would
like
to
briefly
address
myself
to
an
additional
question
which
the
respondent
has
attempted
to
smuggle
before
this
court
in
his
brief
on
the
merits.
the
additional
question
relates
to
the
exhaustion
of
the
state
remedies.
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
this
case
reflects
no
reason
whatsoever,
for
this
court
to
depart
from
his
normal
policy
to
disregard
a
question
when
it
is
not
properly
before
this
court,
it
was
not
presented
to
the
court
below,
and
if
accepted
by
this
court
would
alter
rather
than
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
below.
additionally,
substantively
the
argument
is
without
merit.
the
petitioner
has
presented
to
the
state
courts
a
claim
substantially
equivalent
to
the
claim
presented
to
the
federal
district
court.
this
is
the
test
set
forth
in
the
respondent’s
brief
and
in
the
fifth
circuit
case
in
lamberti
v.
wainwright,
clearly
under
the
exhaustion
doctrine
repeated
application
to
the
state
courts
are
not
necessary
and
the
mere
possibility
of
success
in
state
court
in
light
of
the
facts
of
chambers
v.
mississippi
is
no
bar
to
federal
relief
in
this
case
under
this
court’s
decision
in
wilverding.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
it
was
not
raised
in
the
fifth
circuit
before
the
panel
which
decided
the
--
which
entered
the
judgment
which
is
before
this
court.
it
was
raised
in
a
supplemental
brief
after
the
decision
was
made
by
the
panel,
when
the
fifth
circuit
tentatively
agreed
to
hear
the
case
en
banc.
the
court
subsequently
vacated,
the
order
of
granting
rehearing
en
banc
and
no
action
was
ever
taken
en
banc.
the
court
reinstated
the
panel
decision
and
the
panel
decision
in
no
way
could
have
related
to
the
exhaustion
argument.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
yes,
there
is
no
question.
that
is
the
only
question
that
was
raise
below.
the
respondent’s
exhaustion
argument
was
not.
we
would
respectfully
request
that
this
court
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
below,
i
would
respectfully
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
no
you
can
not
your
honor.
the
letters
clearly
reflect
that
the
wife
wrote
to
the
petitioner
saying,
they
do
not
understand
how
i
can
feel
love
you
but
they
all
think
you
did
it.
those
were
the
letters
that
we
attempted
to
submit
to
the
--
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
in
the
order
of
dismissal
entered
by
the
district
court,
the
district
court
accepted
our
averment
as
to
the
contents
of
those
letters
on
the
basis
that
--
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
the
order
of
dismissal
your
honor
is
contained
in
the
appendix
at
pages
213
and
214.
at
pages
213
and
214,
the
district
court's
order
of
dismissal
is
reflected
saying
that
linda
knew
the
petitioner
had
not
done
it
and
that
linda
was
not
at
the
store
during
the
afternoon
of
april
14th,
1971.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
yes
your
honor
and
these
allegations
were
based
on
the
averments
of
the
petitioner
which
were
uncontroverted
before
the
district
court.
he
was
entirely
entitled
to
make
those
findings.
certainly
the
respondent
gave
him
no
cold
method,
nor
did
the
respondents
cross
appealed
those
findings.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
that
is
right,
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
defense
counsel
tried
to
ask
her
on
the
stand,
there
was
--
maybe
the
third
question
out
of
his
mouth
on
approximately
page
85
of
this
appendix,
he
said
isn’t
it
a
fact
that
you
know
that
gary
maness
did
not,
and
he
was
cut
off
in
mid
question
by
an
objection
based
on
the
voucher
rule
and
that
objection
was
sustained
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
they
are
before
you,
your
honor
in
support
of
our
general
--
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
the
letters
are
before
you
in
fact
because
they
were
attached
to
our
motion
to
supplement
in
the
fifth
circuit
which
was
denied
by
the
fifth
circuit.
the
unavailability
of
the
letters
never
became
a
question
until
the
fifth
circuit
raised
the
question
of
there
unavailability.
in
the
district
court
the
question
of
their
unavailability
never
came
up.
we
were
relying
on
federal
rule
or
civil
procedure
8
which
says
that
the
effect
of
a
failure
of
the
respondent
to
deny
is
to
admit
our
allegations
in
our
petition
and
if
the
respondent
is
without
--
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
whatever
we
allege,
because
they
made
no
--
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
your
honor,
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
8
(b)
says,
if
the
respondent
is
without
knowledge,
he
may
so
state
and
this
constitution
--
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
i
see.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
yes.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
that
is
correct.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
i
think
as
you
can
safely
ignore
them
and
still
grant
this
petitioner
relief.
your
honor,
that
if
proffer
of
dana
maness’s
testimony
supports
the
exact
same
contentions
that
are
raised
in
the
letters
that
the
petitioner
was
not
guilty
and
that
linda
knew
it
and
that
linda
was
not
at
the
store
at
the
time
the
baby
was
injured
as
she
had
testified
from
the
stand.
the
same
allegations,
the
letters,
i
am
really
corrobative
in
a
sense
of
dana
maness’s
testimony,
which
is
before
the
court
in
the
proffer
on
pages
123
and
124,
and
we
would
submit
that
coupled
with
the
inability
to
cross-examine
linda
maness
is
sufficient
to
warrant,
granting
this
petitioner
relief.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
we
did
not
your
honor.
the
trial
judge,
however,
precluded
he
was
willing
to
look
at
those
letters
and
exclude
them
without
any
admission.
she
made
it
quite
clear
that
there
was
no
sense
in
the
petitioner’s
counsel
persisting
because
she
was
not
going
to
get
those
letters,
she
is
not
going
to
let
those
letters
into
evidence
in
any
way.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
your
honor,
the
letters
are
only
supportive
of
our
general
claim.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
because
we
made
allegations
to
that
fact
in
the
federal
district
court
which
either
the
court
or
the
respondent
could
have
called
into
question.
neither
the
respondent
nor
the
court
called
those
into
question,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
adopted
those
characterizations.
that
is
how
you
know.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
your
honor,
they
were
not
just
two
letters
shown
to
the
trial
judge;
the
petitioner’s
counsel
said,
i
have
a
bunch
of
letters.
then
the
trail
judge
said,
let
me
see
the
one
that
you
have
there,
and
then
she
excluded
all
the
letters
on
the
basis
of
the
voucher
rule.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
i
suggest
that
the
court
might
look
at
page
88
of
the
appendix
which
identifies
--
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
page
88
of
the
appendix
which
reflects
--
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
that
is
what
the
trial
judge
said.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
april
28,
1971
approximately
at
mid
page
your
honor.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
but
it
is
clear,
lower
on
that
page
that
he
has
a
whole
bunch
of
letters
and
he
makes
every
attempt
to
have
those
letters
introduced
into
evidence.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
thank
you.
if
possible
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
thank
you.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
i
don’t
believe
that
the
petitioner
knew
for
certain
or
was
willing
to
testify
that
for
certain
linda
had
done
that
but
he
did
directly
accuse
his
wife.
there
are
number
of
places
in
the
record
and
am
i
can
refer
the
court
through
those
places
if
the
court
wishes.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
he
offered
the
testimony
of
dana
maness
to
the
extent
that
linda
said
that
the
petitioner
did
not
do
it
and
that
linda
had
not
gone
to
the
store
at
the
time
the
baby
was
injured
as
she
had
testified
from
the
stand.
additionally
petitioner’s
counsel
in
opening
statement
of
the
five
sentence
of
his
own
statement,
he
said
that
petitioner
did
not
do
it
and
we
will
show
who
probably
did.
he
had
previously
stated
that
linda
would
be
the
defense’s
chief
witness.
the
petitioner
had
denied
killing
the
baby
on
the
stand.
there
are
only
two
suspects
in
this
case.
he
testified
that
linda
discovered
the
baby
comatose,
and
that
the
baby
was
injured
while
he
was
in
the
front
yard
outside
of
the
house.
he
testified
that
linda
was
lying
when
she
left
the
house.
i
will
give
you
the
references
for
this
if
you
like.
the
opening
statement
regarding
the
fact
that
defense
was
going
to
show
who
probably
killed
the
baby
appears
at
appendix
25
that
linda
would
be
the
defendant’s
chief
witness
at
appendix
17,
the
petitioner
denied
telling
the
baby
at
100,
linda
discover
the
baby
according
to
gary
at
102,
gary
testified
that
the
baby
was
injured
before
the
petitioner
returned
from
work,
101,
that
linda
was
lying
when
she
said
that
she
left
the
house,
117,
that
the
petitioner
testified
that
he
lied
to
the
police
to
protect
linda
from
jail,
108-109,
114,
117,
120.
additionally
he
testified
that
an
inspector
head,
the
hospital
head
told
him
that
one
of
them
would
go
to
jail
if
the
baby
died.
that
appears
i
believe
at
108
and
two
times
on
120.
the
petitioner
further
testified
that
he
had
never
struck
the
child
on
the
face
contrary
to
linda’s
testimony
and
also
contrary
to
the
proffered
testimony
in
dana’s,
in
the
proffered
relating
to
dana’s
testimony
where
dana
say
that
linda
said
that
the
petitioner
never
touched
the
child,
and
also
that
the
petitioner
only
knew
what
linda
had
told
him
about
how
the
child
was
injured.
and
this
appears
at
numerous
places
in
the
record
at
120,
at
118-119,
at
115,
and
at
103-105.
i
would
also,
in
terms
of
whether
he
was
successful
in
pointing
the
finger
back
at
linda.
i
would
also
appoint
out
to
the
court
that
the
state
requested
a
jury
instruction
to
convict
gary
as
an
accomplice.
he
could
only
have
been
an
accomplice
to
one
person.
and
they
made
that
request
at
page
134
of
the
appendix.
that
request
was
denied
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
bennett
h.
brummer
thank
you
your
honor.
