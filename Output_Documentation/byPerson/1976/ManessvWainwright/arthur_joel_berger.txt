mr.
arthur
joel
berger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
arthur
joel
berger
counsel
for
the
respondent
louie
(ph)
wainwright.
your
honors,
petitioner’s
argument
in
this
case
is
predicated
on
the
mischaracterization
that
is
solely
because
of
an
arbitrary
finding
the
linda
maness
was
not
an
adverse
witness
at
the
trail
court
pursuant
to
florida
statutes
90.09
kept
numerous
facts
from
the
jury
which
would
tend
to
establish
a
doubt
of
petitioner’s
guilt.
petitioners’
then
rise
on
chambers
as
the
legal
basis
for
his
relief.
respondents
in
which
your
honors
then
under
a
proper
characterization
of
what
intact
the
court
below,
four
concepts
resolve
this
case,
and
these
are
the
crucial
concepts
with
which
this
court
must
filter
the
various
factual
matters
which
he
has
before.
state
court
has
no
problem
with
this
court’s
decision
in
chambers,
but
the
factual
situation
in
chambers
your
honors
is
materially
different
than
that
situation
which
this
court
is
presented
with
in
the
instant
case.
in
chambers
the
defendant
was
precluded
from
introducing
dynamite,
highly
prohibitive,
quality
reliable
evidence,
evidence
of
his
innocence.
but
in
this
case
your
honors,
the
evidence
which
was
excluded
smokescreen
innuendo
evidence
with
which
petitioner
sought
to
confuse
the
jury.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
that
is
correct
your
honor.
there
were
numerous
rules
of
evidence
which
sustained
the
trial
court’s
rulings
in
exclusion.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
yes
your
honor,
i
ma
merely
suggesting
this,
i
will
subsequently
get
into
the
reasons,
why
this
occurred.
i
am
merely
stating
that
once
you
see
the
situation
if
actually
has
exists
in
this
record
that
you
will
be
able
to
see
that
what
petitioner
is
setting
up
as
a
smokescreen
and
he
wishes
to
analogize
that
smokescreen
to
the
solid
evidence,
the
dynamite
evidence
that
chambers
had
which
so
concern
this
court.
thus
your
honors
the
chambers
was
decided
not
only
on
evidentiary
principles
but
most
importantly,
as
justice
powell
emphasized
in
his
opinion,
was
decided
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
that
were
before
this
court
when
it
rendered
chambers
decision.
second
concept
we
ask
you
to
filter
and
we
subsequently
get
to
the
facts
what
actually
occurred
in
this
case,
is
that
in
chambers,
this
court
to
painstaking
efforts
to
clarify
one
proposition
that
the
state
and
the
defense
must
still
follow
the
rules
and
evidence
and
those
rules
of
evidence
your
honors
that
this
court
require
both
sides
to
follow.
the
rules
which
in
fact
are
based
on
a
theory
that
these
rules
enhance
the
integrity
of
the
fact
finding
process.
this
court
did
not
hold
in
chambers
that
every
evidentiary
ruling
becomes
a
constitutional
question
regardless
of
whether
that
rule
of
evidence
enhances
the
truth
finding
process.
this
court
did
not
state
that
the
mere
preclusion
of
any
evidence
denies
due
process
if
it
in
some
way
hampers
the
defendant
to
presenting
his
case
of
and
creating
some
doubt
of
guilt.
if
such
were
the
test
your
honors
which
is
an
essence
what
the
defendant
is
stating
to
this
court,
if
such
were
the
test
there
would
be
no
rules
of
evidence
which
could
withstand
a
due
process
attack.
in
this
respect
your
honors,
the
maness
situation
is
directly
opposite
the
rationale
of
chambers.
in
maness
rules
and
evidence
which
kept
up
the
evidence
were
rules
designed
to
ensure
the
integrity
of
the
truth
finding
process.
the
third
concept
we
ask
you
to
look
at
this
case
or
by
after
we
get
to
defense.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
your
honors,
we
note
what
this
court
set
in
chambers
but
we
do
submit
that
the
voucher
rule
has
one
very
important
purpose
with
regard
to
integrity
of
the
truth
finding
process
and
that
it
precludes
confusion
of
the
jury.
it
precludes
--
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
yes
sir,
it
does
--
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
no
your
honors,
we
will
suggest
later.
this
case
did
not
turn
on
the
voucher
rule
at
all
as
we
have
indicated,
petitioner
has
mischaracterized
the
situation,
he
tried
to
create
the
simple
picture
before
this
court
that
but
for
the
voucher
rule
all
this
evidence
would
come
in,
but
we
submit
that
in
spite
of
our
position
or
in
our
position
that
other
rules
of
evidence,
rules
which
no
doubt
can
--
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
yes
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
yes
your
honor,
but
we
will
show
--
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
well,
your
honor
as
we
will
show
clearly
that
the
only
purpose
of
the
voucher
rule
is
primarily
state
objections.
there
are
some
indications
in
the
record,
the
court
was
merely
stating,
we
have
got
to
feel
that
this
witness
was
adverse,
but
you
will
see
in
reading
of
this
transcript,
the
crucial
portion
of
this
record
which
we
will
get
to
very
soon.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
yes
your
honor,
in
those
cases
which
florida
oppose
are
cited
immediately
after
our
citation
to
the
same
rule
stated
in
cases
by
this
court.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
which
position
your
honors?
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
the
initial
brief,
that
was
filed
by
respondent
in
this
case
directed
generally
to
this
proposition.
the
exact
theory
your
honors
which
we
were
representing
to
this
court
in
our
brief
on
both
grounds
was
presented
in
supplemental
brief
order
by
the
en
banc
court.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
the
three-judge
court,
your
honors.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
they
did
not,
--
i
do
not
think
that
the
opinion
to
begin
with
this
court
of
the
brief
of
our
side
lade
out
all
these
rules
of
correspondence.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
the
theory
that
was,
the
exact
theory
we
are
presenting
here
your
honors
is
the
one
that
i
presented
when
i
got
the
case
in
supplemental
brief
en
banc.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
i
did
not
argue
to
the
three-member
but
that
would
be
--
we
did
not
precisely
take
these
exact
positions.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
well
your
honor,
if
i
might
rephrase
your
question,
what
petitioner
was
asserting
is
that
it
was
the
voucher
rule,
that
kept
this
out
and
we
ask
your
honor
to
look
very
closely,
it’s
the
florida
statutes
90.09,
1971
statutes,
which
says
nothing
about
leading
questions
your
honor,
it
talks
about
adversity.
what
this
court
did,
as
we
get
to
it
in
one
moment,
is
sustained
these
objections
and
expressly
stated,
your
honors
on
page
86.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
court
said,
the
objection
sustained
stricken,
she
is
your
witness,
ask
her
question
that
are
not
leading,
he
did
not
say,
you
could
have
impeach
her.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
i
know
your
honor.
the
court
may,
under
florida
law,
has
in
its
discretion,
the
right
to
allow
any
party
to
ask
leading
questions.
you
can
ask
leading
questions
of
your
own
witnesses,
is
has
nothing
to
do
directly
with
the
voucher
rule.
the
court
was
merely
stating
not
now.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
well,
your
honor,
i
guess
we
just
differ
on
that.
like
i
said,
my
understanding
is
that
this
is
a
ruling
or
petitioner
is
trying
to
indicate
a
ruling
totally
on
florida
statutes
90.09,
and
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
statute
which
indicates
anything
about
leading
questions.
that
is
totally
in
benefit
of
the
proposition.
third
concept
which
was
now
emphasized
is
this,
if
the
state
trial
court
judge
acted
fairly
to
both
sides
in
this
case,
it
do
not
act
arbitrarily
when
it
rules
and
it
did
not
abuse
its
discretion
in
any
one
of
those
rulings.
five,
the
forth
and
last
principle
we
ask
you
to
look
at
before
we
go
to
the
record
in
this
case
is
this,
assuming
that
there
was
any
evidentiary
error
which
this
court
finds
in
this
case
that
error
do
not
wrong
as
to
the
level
of
denying
petitioner
an
unfair
trial.
for
three
primary
reasons:
your
honors
as
you
review
the
testimony
of
petitioner,
you
will
find
according
to
his
confession
his
crime
occurred
around
4
o’clock.
the
state
obviously
did
not
when
the
fatal
blows
were
stuck.
petitioner
in
his
testimony
does
not
state
that
he
was
not
in
the
house
at
4
o’clock,
in
fact
his
testimony
indicates
that
he
was
there.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
that
is
correct
your
honor.
but
though
petitioner
tells
you
that
he
was
still
at
the
house
and
that
viewing
his
entire
testimony,
there
was
not
one
statement
in
this
record
during
petitioner’s
case
in
which
he
says
linda
did
it.
there
were
a
lot
of
inferences
that
petitioner
wishes
you
to
draw
stating
that
he
said
that,
but
unless
petitioner
turns
to
the
jury
and
tells
him,
my
wife
did
it,
how
can
any
evidentiary
error
that
might
have
occurred
in
this
court
--
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
well,
your
honor
what
i
am
stating
at
this
point
is
that
if
petitioner
when
he
gets
up
there
on
the
stand
and
does
not
state
my
wife
to
did
it
that
that
as
totality
in
construing
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
is
very
important
to
determine
whether
if
this
court
find
any
evidentiary
error
that
this
case
constitutes
within
due
process.
the
second
point
is
that
defendant
never
presented
any
secondary
evidence
other
than
his
statements
to
indicate
in
any
way
that
linda
had
anytime
touched
that
child.
the
third
point
is
that
the
evidence
which
petitioners
complaining
about
now
that
he
says
was
kept
out,
was
not
highly
exculpatory,
at
best
your
honors
this
evidence
was
directed
towards
showing
that
linda
was
not
a
credible
witness
or
might
be
a
liar.
furthermore,
that
she
might
have
been
present
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
but
mere
presence
at
the
time
of
the
crime
your
honors
is
not,
as
petitioner
would
have
this
court
equate,
is
showing
that
linda
committed
this
crime.
as
we
have
indicated
this
case
turns
on
15
pages
in
the
appendix,
i
would
ask
the
court
to
indulge
mean
if
they
would
to
look
of
the
appendix
with
me
to
see
exactly
what
occurred
at
this
trial
and
what
the
judge’s
rulings
were.
that
would
be
--
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
yes
that
would
begin
on
page
85.
now,
i
would
like
for
you
to
get
a
sense
from
the
cold
record
of
what
the
trail
judge
was
doing.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
yes,
justice
stewart,
85.
petitioner
starts
to
ask
a
question,
he
has
not
even
asked
linda
maness
her
name
yet.
so,
the
court
states
that
that
is
what
he
should
do.
he
next
immediately
tells
this
court
before
there
is
any
question
asked
that
he
wants
linda
declared
as
an
adverse
witness,
but
there
was
no
evidence
before
the
court
to
indicate
that
she
is
an
adverse
witness.
that
is
all
the
court
says
at
this
point.
it
is
denied
because
there
was
no
showing.
now,
he
starts
to
ask
another
leading
question.
the
prosecutor
indicates
something
with
regard
to
florida
statutes
90.09,
but
what
does
the
court
do.
does
it
say,
you
can
not
impeach
linda
because
there
is
no
way
you
are
going
to
make
a
showing
that
she
is
adverse?
the
court
says
but
your
objection
sustained
as
to
leading.
i
do
not
know
whether
he
is
impeaching
or
not.
the
court
is
stating
not
now,
she
is
not
adverse.
the
court
is
not
stating
categorically
that
she
could
never
be
impeached.
page
86,
counsel
starts
to
inquire
and
the
court
does
not
say
you
are
not
allowed
to
impeach
linda
maness
because
she
is
never
going
to
be
an
adverse
witness
and
we
are
cutting
it
off
right
now,
such
as
it
was
the
situation
in
chambers,
where
in
chambers
this
the
trial
court
had
all
the
facts
at
the
point.
what
she
is
stating
is,
just
ask
her
questions
that
are
not
leading.
now,
we
go
down
a
little
bit
and
we
start
the
testimony.
one
of
the
questions
is,
with
regard
to
a
bruise
that
this
baby
had
in
the
morning,
the
defense
ask,
how
did
that
baby
get
the
bruise
on
her
forehead?
does
linda
maness
turn
around
and
say,
gary,
my
husband
did
it?
no
your
honors.
what
does
she
say?
she
say,
i
do
not
know.
this
is
an
adverse
way,
that
he
wants
to
call
adverse,
it
was
pointing
the
finger
to
her
husband,
i
do
not
know.
then
the
court
merely
states
after
that,
well
i
think
we
just
return
at
them
narrative
events
that
you
are
starting
to
ask
of
me
--
narrative.
that
is
all
the
court
says,
it
does
not
say,
do
not
impeach,
because
we
have
got
to
look
what
the
trial
judge
is
doing
to
petitioner
in
this
case.
page
88,
there
is
an
objection
regarding
hearsay,
the
court
sustains
on
hearsay
grounds
and
not
the
adverse
with
this
rule.
counsel
then
asked,
“did
you
tell
anybody
anytime
how
that
baby
was
injured?”
and
this
is
the
answer
of
petitioner,
what
have
you
believe,
is
on
adverse
witness,
“no,
i
did
know
how
she
was
injured.”
she
is
not
testified
against
petitioner
maness.
then
the
court
says,
let
us
start
talking
about,
or
the
defense
starts
talking
about
the
letter
we
got
day-to-day
for
28,
1971.
it
is
a
letter
that
is
a
marked,
he
just
gets
up
there
and
says,
read
this
letter
to
the
court.
now,
a
letter
that
has
not
even
introduced
in
evidence
or
just
even
been
sought
to
be
introduced
into
evidence.
mr.
mcwilliams
(ph)
suggest
there
is
no
proper
predicate
that
the
court
should
sustain,
what
does
a
court
do
with
regard
to
this
letter,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
is
not
introduced,
in
spite
of
anything
this
court
bends
over
backwards
and
says,
let
me
see
that
letter
you
are
starting
to
talk
about
now,
the
specific
letter,
the
april
28th,
letter
which
you
want
to
have
read
to
jury.
and
this
has
done
as
the
court
emphasizes,
knowing
that
it
has
not
even
been
even
marked
for
identification,
your
honors,
is
bending
backwards,
over
backwards
to
try
and
be
fair
to
the
defendant.
she
looks
in
that
letter
and
she
makes
an
unchallenged
ruling
after
looking
at
that
letter
and
states
that
all
this
letter
shows
is
that
linda
maness
loves
her
husband,
it
does
not
show
adversity.
then
the
court
asks,
is
there
something
you
attempting
to
impeach
this
witness
on?
there
has
been
no
question
asked
along
these
lines.
that
is
an
indication
your
honors,
not
that
petitioner
will
never
be
allowed
to
impeach
but
just
that
this
court
having
heard
no
inconsistent
statement
states
not
now.
he
then
proceeds
on
and
the
court
says,
you
can
not
get
this
letter
on
to
evidence
unless
there
is
something
she
says
that
is
contrary.
you
want
to
impeach
by
an
inconsistent
statement,
you
have
to
have
some
statement
for
which
the
evidence
you
are
going
to
use
as
inconsistence.
this
is
not
a
trial
judge
that
is
saying
you
can
never
impeach
because
of
the
voucher
rule.
defense
counsel
says,
well,
i
have
got
another
letter,
eventually
this
letter.
the
trial
judge
that
they
would
have
you
believe
is
acting
arbitrarily
in
keeping
our
all
of
this
evidence.
she
says,
okay
i
will
look
at
that
letter
also.
she
categorizes
an
objection
again,
on
the
basis
of
that
pleading,
not
the
petitioner
maness
will
never
be
allowed
to
impeach,
and
all
this
court
says
is
everything
you
have
shown
me,
and
obviously
in
this
case,
petitioner
never
showed
all
these
letters,
that
the
court
never
said,
i
will
never
look
it
all
these
letters,
i
will
look
at
everything
you
got.
the
court
says,
all
you
show
me
as
a
bunch
of
love
letters
so
far.
this
is
not
an
adverse
witness
yet.
then
mr.
minkess
(ph)
something
that
would
be
very
important
in
this
court’s
review
of
this
various
items
or
evidence.
he
explains
why
he
wants
us
to
use
this
letters
as
a
substantive
evidence
of
guilt,
but
he
says
in
page
90,
he
says
these
letters
can
come
in
from
impeachment.
now,
what
does
the
court
say?
does
the
court
say
you
can
never
use
these
letters
for
impeachment?
this
court
judge
did
not
preclude
arbitrarily
in
impeachment
of
this
witness.
she
says,
but
there
is
nothing
to
impeach
yet,
there
is
an
inconsistence
statement.
the
court
then
says
something
that
is
quite
contradictory
to
the
impression
that
petitioner
wishes
you
to
get
off
the
trial
judge’s
actions
because
right
after
this,
this
colloquy
occurs
at
the
court,
but
there
is
nothing
to
impeach.
mr.
minkess
(ph)
could
i
call
her
as
an
adverse
witness?
then
what
does
the
court
say,
do
they
say,
do
you
want
to
let
him,
she
is
not
precluding
at
this
point.
then
all
she
says
is
right
after
that,
well,
let
us
pass
on
the
issue
right
now,
let
us
go
back
to
the
original
question
you
asked,
and
if
there
is
something
to
impeach
we
can
come
to
it.
and
she
says,
i
think
that
is
the
best
way
to
do
it.
then
petitioner
talks
about
some
statement
to
the
police
or
some
statement
regard
to
the
being
out
the
house.
in
all
the
court
says
is
that
this
time
she
is
not
an
adverse
witness,
these
letters
show
that
she
is
not
an
adverse
witness,
and
then
the
court
says
something
that
this
court
said
in
chambers.
that
is
on
page
91.
the
court,
“we
are
going
to
have
to
proceed
by
the
rules
of
evidence
counsel,
she
has
not
said
anything
for
you
to
impeach.”
at
this
point
counsel
talks
about
some
letters
to
the
police
indicating
that
she
never
stated
in
that
one
statement
to
the
police
that
she
was
not
out
of
the
house.
the
court
looks
at
the
statement
and
says
that
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
because
they
never
answer
the
question.
it
is
not
stating
that
as
petitioner
would
have
you
believed
that
what
occurred
at
this
trail
was
a
precluding
of
his
ability
to
impeach
solely
because
of
florida
statutes
90.09.
then
there
is
another
crucial
point
which
we
will
emphasize
subsequently
during
maness
ask
his
wife,
did
you
tell
your
husband
on
particular
date
that
she
was
pregnant,
then
what
does
counsel
do,
he
does
not
get
an
answer.
he
withdraws
the
question.
this
question
has
never
brought
up
again,
there
is
never
testimony.
this
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
92
your
honors.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
because
at
that
point
your
honors,
she
has
not
indicated,
there
was
no
evidence
to
indicate
that
linda
maness
was
not
--
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
she
is
not
referring
to
defense
counsel
your
honor.
that
is
just
a
colloquial
expression,
as
i
understand
it.
no
boy,
is
this
an
impossible
situation,
something
like
that.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
yes
your
honor,
so
be
correct
--
on
part.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
well,
your
honor,
at
that
time
the
court
was
merely
stating
that
it
had
no
evidence
before
that
she
was
adverse,
but
it
was
not
stating
that
--
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
that
is
all
what
the
court
was
doing,
they
said,
do
not
asking
him
the
question,
there
is
nothing
inconsistent.
yeah,
you
have
not
shown
me
adversity
yet.
it
did
not
say
you
can
never
bring
this
in
later.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
well,
your
honors
that
raises
a
very
important
point.
the
concept
of
adversity
is
that
a
witness
subject
before
the
court
and
tell
the
jury
something
that
is
incriminating
against
the
defendant.
now
the
question
that
you
have
posed
or
other
way
you
have
formulated
the
question
is
that
you
are
now
making
the
adverse
witness
test,
not
one
as
we
had
indicated,
but
a
suspect
test,
which
is
--
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
yes
but
she
never
says
the
defendant
did
it
at
this
point
moreover
your
honor
--
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
yes,
your
honor,
but
she
repeatedly
tell
to
the
jury,
“i
do
not
know
how
this
baby
was
killed.”
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
that
would
be
correct
your
honor
because
her
position
is
she
does
not
know
how
this
baby
was
hurt.
she
was
not
testified
arbitrarily.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
she
does
not
state
that
she
knows
that
the
father
was
the
only
person
present.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
yes,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
no,
your
honor,
we
submit
again
that
you
can
not
take
this
position
that
an
adverse
witness
or
any
person
can
be
impeached
only
because
he
is
a
suspect,
because
if
that
is
true
your
honors
in
every
case
that
we
will
ever
have
unless
there
is
a
clear
confession
that
everyone
sees.
there
are
multiple
suspects
with
regard
to
a
case.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
i
submit
not
your
honor.
again,
i
submit
that
that
is
just
a
suspect
testing
and
there
would
have
to
be
some
parameters
once
again
as
part
of
--
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
no
your
honor,
we
submit
--
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
we
submit
that
the
situation
--
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
if
linda
maness
had
gotten
before
the
jury
and
said,
“i
know
gary
maness
did
it,
he
did
it.”
in
that
situation
there
would
be
adversity.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
i
mean
if
one
part
is
called
to
the
stand,
i
submit
your
honors,
that
that
--
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
i
submit
to
that
that
is
not
the
predicate.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
i
submit
your
honors
that
you,
i
guess
you
could
not
unless
the
witness
was
getting
up
thier
actively.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
that
is
correct
your
honor,
because,
as
i
have
indicated,
then
that
would
allow
every
suspect
in
case
to
be
brought
to
the
stand
and
cross
examined
again
totally
destroying
that
witness
for
no
apparent
reasons.
and
if
there
were
four
people
involved
to
our
suspects,
petitioner
would
have
you
believe
that
you
can
just
create
each,
one
of
those
four
to
create
some
kind
of
doubt.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
well,
your
honor
that
goes
toward,
we
submit,
confusion
of
the
jury,
unless
there
are
some
affirmative
evidence
in
this
case
like
in
chambers.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
yes
your
honor
and
that
is
exactly
what
counsel
wanted
to
do.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
counsel,
at
his
point
across
your
honors,
without
any
answers,
he
was
creating
doubt
merely
by
the
questions.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
well,
your
honor
that
rule
is
contained
in
florida
statutes
90.09.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
that
statement
says,
if
i
can
quote.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
it
says,
“but
before
the
last
proof
can
be
given,
and
that
is
prior
inconsistent
statement,
the
circumstances
of
the
statement
sufficient
to
designate
the
occasion,
must
we
mentions
to
the
witness,
and
he
must
be
asked
whether
or
not
he
made
the
statement.”
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
oh
(inaudible)
your
honor.
florida
law
provides
that
if
you
have
impeaching
evidence
that
evidence
comes
in
only
from
impeachment
unless
that
particular
piece
of
evidence
also
is
admissible
substantive
evidence
under
rules
of
law,
as
we
have
indicated
in
remainder
of
our
brief
which
we
are
unable
to
get
to
that
there
are
numerous
rules
which
preclude
this
evidence
from
coming
in
as
substantive
evidence.
even
though
on
this
record
your
honors
we
know
that
there
was
no
indication
of
--
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
no
your
honors,
the
procedure
that
we
would
have
to
be
employed
in
this
case
is
that
a
normal
impeachment
type
of
examination
would
have
to
occur
following
that
counsel
must
mark
for
identification
and
seek
to
introduce
that
evidence
as
substantive
evidence
itself,
in
essence
where
it
is
true,
and
not
just
to
show
contradictions.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
well,
that
depends
on
the
evidence.
as
i
indicated
before,
i
am
sorry
if
i
was
not
cleat,
then
the
court
must
rule
on
this
piece
of
evidence
as
it
would
any
other
piece
of
evidence
and
determine
if
it
is
admissible.
mr.
arthur
joel
berger
exactly,
it
would
be
used
for
impeachment
but
if
it
is
clear
hearsay,
it
could
not
be
admitted
as
substantive
evidence
if
the
party
sought
to
admit
it
as
substantive
evidence
and
tell
the
court
that
it
wanted
that
evidence
admitted
as
substantive
evidence
in
addition
to
impeaching
evidence.
thank
you
your
honor.
