unknown
speaker
but
it
was
raised
in
the
fifth
circuit,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
really,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
your
due
process
argument
certainly
was
as
defense
below.
unknown
speaker
mr.
brummer
before
you
sit
down,
we
talk
yesterday
little
bit
about
the
fact
that
these
letters
are
not
in
evidence,
the
ones
that
you
rely
on,
and
in
the
examination
of
the
wife
in
the
court
below,
when
the
letters
are
offered,
the
court,
after
looking
at
one
or
two
of
them,
said,
counsel,
what
you
have
shown
me
is
a
bunch
of
love
letters
to
her
husband
from
a
girl
who
loves
her
husband,
no
matter
what
he
has
done,
it
says
so,
and
we
except
that
characterization
by
the
court
as
a
correct
description
what'
is
in
the
letter.
unknown
speaker
where
mr.
brummer
is
the
most
accurate
statement
in
the
record
of
what
you
can
tend
the
letter
show.
i
could
not
even
find
the
summary
of
the
letters
in
the
appendix.
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
know
from
the
written
material
what
your
averments
are,
where
do
we
find
that?
unknown
speaker
in
page
213,
he
describes
the
letters
in
that
way.
unknown
speaker
as
to
the
allegations
that
she
knew
petitioners
had
not
done
it.
unknown
speaker
did
you
proffer
the
letters
themselves?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
does
the
reviewing
court
evaluate
the
trial
judge’s
exclusion
without
examining
the
letters?
unknown
speaker
how
does
the
reviewing
court
know
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
brummer,
let
me
ask
one
more
question.
justice
powell
has
showed
me
the
appendix
to
your
motion
to
supplement
the
record
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
which
you
did
quote
from
at
least
one
of
the
letters
and
in
one
of
those
letters
there
is
the
statement,
“nobody
can
understand
why
i
still
love
you
but
then
they
all
think
you
did
it,
that
is
when
i
said
before.”
now,
can
you
tell
me
whether
that
letter
is
was
one
of
those
that
were
shown
to
the
trail
judge
at
the
trail?
is
there
any
way
we
can
know
whether
that
is
one
of
those
letters?
is
there
any
way
we
can
know
which
two
letters
were
shown
at
the
trial
judge?
unknown
speaker
but
he
refers
specifically
the
one,
a
love
letter
to
her
husband
from
a
girl
who
loves
her
husband
no
matter
what
he
has
done,
that
says
that
his
characterizations
is
quite
different
from
the
impression
one
gets
from
the
language
you
emphasize.
the
answer
is
i
suppose
is
the
record
really
does
not
tell
us
which
letters
were
shown
to
the
trial
judge.
the
whole
bunch
was
handed
to
him,
but
which
one
he
is
referring
to,
we
do
not
know,
because
none
were
marked
at
the
trial.
unknown
speaker
what
page?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mack(ph)
i
have
a
whole
bunch
of
letters
your
honor
the
court,
i
just
want
to
see
the
one
we
are
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
and
i
was
trying
to
figure
out
which
one
you
were
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
it
wasn’t
excluded
on
that
basis.
unknown
speaker
but
it
wasn’t
--
the
trial
judge
did
not
use
those
reasons.
unknown
speaker
mr.
berger
do
you
characterize
that
voucher
rule
is
such
a
rule.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
do
you
characterize
that
voucher
rule
is
such
a
rule?
unknown
speaker
so,
your
position
is
not
that
the
voucher
rule
did
not
have
any
impact
but
rather
that
the
voucher
rule
is
a
good
sound
rule.
unknown
speaker
but
wouldn’t
that
be
correct
to
say
that
the
trial
judge
did
in
part
rely
on
the
voucher
rule.
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
showing
that
he
had
other
grounds
on
which
he
might
have
relied?
unknown
speaker
we
do
not
really
know
whether
he
would
have
relied
on
those
grounds
had
he
not
placed
his
ruling
on
the
voucher
rule.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rogers
(ph)
i
think
wigmore
contains
the
statement
that
many
jurisdictions
follow
a
rule
that
on
appeal
where
a
challenge
has
made
to
the
exclusion
of
evidence,
the
trial
judge’s
ruling
will
be
upheld
if
there
was
any
basis
upon
which
the
exclusion
could
have
been
properly
sustained,
even
though
the
reason
assigned
by
the
trial
judge
was
not
a
correct
one.
is
this
(inaudible)
that
rule
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
doesn’t
all
this
argument
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
was
this
position
taken
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
you
are
now
arguing.
unknown
speaker
that
there
were
other
reasons
for
it
or
refresh
new
reasons.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
not
talking
about
the
en
banc
court
about
the
panel
court.
unknown
speaker
yes
sir.
unknown
speaker
you
did
not
raise
it.
is
it
random?
i
am
not
saying
you
can
not
do
it,
i
am
just
trying
to
find
out
the
facts.
i
am
not
saying
it
is
improper.
unknown
speaker
but
not
before
the
panel.
that
is
what
we
trying
to
get
clear.
did
you
raise
these
arguments
and
make
these
points
when
you
argued
to
the
three
member
panel
of
the
fifth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
mr.
berger
i
think
you
are
suggesting,
because
you
help
me
throughout
the
very
beginning
of
what
counsel
intend
to
be
an
adverse
examination
of
the
wife.
he
started
out,
isn’t
it
a
fact
that
you
know
that
your
husband
gary
maness
objection
did
not,
objection
sustained.
counsel
has
represented
towards
intended
that
the
intent
of
that
question
was
to
represent
that
to
ask
if
she
did
not
know
there
husband
did
not
kill
the
baby.
now,
what
is
the
proper
reason
for
sustaining
that
objection
to
the
leading
question
other
than
effect
that
she
was
not
an
adverse
witness
and
therefore
the
voucher
rule
applies?
unknown
speaker
correct.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
court
said,
asking
questions
that
are
not
leading
is
because
she
is
not
an
adverse
witness.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
you
have
a
right
to
ask
leading
questions
if
it
is
not
at
the
discretion
of
the
court
of
the
witness
is
adverse.
so,
the
whole
basis
for
the
ruling
is
quite
obviously
that
the
court
was
not
willing
to
accept
the
view
that
she
should
be
treated
as
a
hostile
witness.
isn’t
that
--
am
i
wrong
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
not
the
autopsy
of
this
infant
child
showed
that
the
injuries
were
over
a
long
period
of
time.
unknown
speaker
they
could
not
determine
when
the
lethal
blows
were
struck
on
the
child’s
head.
unknown
speaker
mr.
berger,
right
on
the
first
page
of
the
examination
the
question,
“did
you
kill
your
baby?”
answer,
“no
i
did
not.”
didn’t
that
present
that
very
point?
you
know
they
dictated
the
idea
to
the
judge
that
that
was
the
defense
theory.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
to
begin
with.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
skipped
something
in
the
middle
of
page
91
where
the
prosecutor
said,
that
is
tending
to
impeach
his
own
witness
which
is
not
admissible,
and
the
court
said,
that
is
right.
unknown
speaker
for
some
reason
she
calls
defense
counsel,
‘boy’.
that
is
kind
of
odd,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
that
is
right,
and
boy,
this
is
not
an
adverse
witness.
unknown
speaker
we
are
just
sticking
with
that
for
just
a
moment
mr.
berger.
you
pointed
out
that
the
court
said,
just
a
little
bit
above
on
page
91,
she
hasn’t
said
anything
for
you
to
impeach,
and
mr.
minkess
said
well
she
said
that
she
was
out
of
the
house
at
the
time
that
the
baby
was
supposedly
be.
now
she
had
said
before
the
jury,
and
i
have
evidence
here
that
she
said
that
she
wasn’t,
and
then
the
court
wasn’t
let
him
use
that
evidence
relying
on
the
voucher
rule
as
i
understand
it.
isn’t
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
that
particular
purported
contradiction
in
the
direct
testimony
as
to
whether
or
not
she
was
present
when
the
child
was
allegedly
beaten.
that
was
a
contradiction
that
was
excluded
on
the
voucher
rule
and
that
really
went
to
the
heart
of
our
case,
didn’t
it,
as
to
whether
or
not
she
was
present
there?
unknown
speaker
then
mr.
minkess
pointed
out
that
there
was
the
conflict,
oh
i
see
as
to
the
adversity
point
because
--
unknown
speaker
how
could
the
defense
counsel
had
shown
adversity?
if
the
theory
of
adversity
is
that
she
really
is
the
one
who
killed
the
child,
and
if
that
point
were
made
to
the
trail
judge
as
it
was
by
the
direct
question,
did
you
kill
the
child?
what
more
was
counsel
required
to
do
to
demonstrate
adversity?
unknown
speaker
but
she
did
say
something
that
tended
to
incriminate
the
defendant
because
she
said
that
she
left
the
house
and
then
when
she
came
back,
the
baby
was
in
the
condition
that
precipitated
the
death.
unknown
speaker
but
she
did
say
the
defendant
was
--
she
was
gone
about
20
minutes
and
the
only
person
there
was
the
defendant.
that
is
not
the
very
difficult
inference
that
draw,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
she
said
that
because
she
was
not
there
but
you
do
not
suggest
that
that
evidence
tended
to
incriminate
the
defendant.
is
that
your
view
of
the
facts?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
she
knows
that
the
baby
suffered
the
beating
during
15
minute
period
when
she
was
away
and
the
father
was
the
only
person
present
and
that
is
not
incriminating.
that
is
your
position.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
was
there
when
she
left
then
he
was
there
when
she
came
back
and
she
does
not
know
if
anybody
else.
now,
that
much
is
clear.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
a
situation
where
the
two
people,
three
persons
in
a
room
and
one
of
them
is
killed,
and
it
is
obvious
that
one
of
the
two
did
it
and
wouldn’t
both
of
them
be
adverse
witnesses
without
more.
unknown
speaker
my
case
is
that
two,
there
are
two
people
in
the
room,
one
of
the
two
kill
the
third
one.
as
our
question
is
which
one
of
them
did
it.
that
is
the
only
question
involved?
wouldn’t
they
automatically
be
adverse
witnesses,
both
of
them?
unknown
speaker
the
only
way
it
could
be
a
non-adverse
witness
would
be
for
the
witness
to
say,
he
did
not
do
it
and
i
did
it.
that
is
the
only
way.
unknown
speaker
what
other
way?
unknown
speaker
what
other
the
testimony
could
he
give?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
that
the
witness
says,
in
my
case,
the
witness
says,
i
did
not
do
it.
both
of
them
say
i
did
not
do
it.
so,
one
of
them
called
to
examine
the
other
one.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
as
an
adverse
witness.
unknown
speaker
well
how
would
you
establish
that
he
is
an
adverse
witness
in
my
type
of
cases?
unknown
speaker
you
couldn’t
establish
that
there
was
an
adverse
witness
on
my
facts
the
one
of
the
two
of
them
did
it.
unknown
speaker
what
is
wrong
with
this?
unknown
speaker
wouldn’t
she
agree
that
with
this
dialogue
back
and
forth
between
the
judge
that
this
jury
was
confused
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
it
would
have
been
less
confusing
if
she
had
testified.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
rule
of
evidence
in
florida
about
prior
inconsistent
statements
of
a
third-party
witness?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
finish
your
answers.
unknown
speaker
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
the
prior
statement
is
admissible
only
for
impeachment
or
is
it
--
unknown
speaker
well,
let
us
just
assume
that
is
an
out-of-court
statement
of
the
witness,
a
third
party
witness,
testifies
something
in
court
and
then
the
examiner
wants
to
introduce
into
evidence
an
out-of-court
prior
statement
inconsistent.
let
us
assume
that
it
is
admissible.
is
it
admissible
only
for
impeachment
or
not?
unknown
speaker
is
it
admissible
for
its
truth?
unknown
speaker
so,
if
it
is
hearsay,
it
is
not
admissible.
unknown
speaker
mr.
brummer,
i
won’t
trespass
on
your
minute
if
the
chief
justice
will
extend
it
a
minute.
on
page
28
of
the
attorney
general’s
brief,
he
makes
the
statement,
“at
no
time
during
gary’s
testimony,
did
gary
directly
state
the
linda
gave
misty
the
fatal
beating
on
april
14th.”
i
am
reading
from
the
attorney
general’s
brief,
page
28.
i
think
i
said
it.
“at
no
time
during
gary’s
testimony,
did
gary
directly
state
that
linda
gave
misty
the
fatal
beating
on
april
14th.”
he
had
agreed
that
they
were
in
the
house
together.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
that
you
can
refute
that
statement.
unknown
speaker
did
he
introduce
the
evidence
of
any
other
witness
supportive
of
that
view?
