chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
6909
in
maness
against
wainwright.
mr.
brummer,
i
think
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
brummer,
at
trial
did
you
ever
really
take
that
position,
that
the
mother
was
guilty
of
the
battery?
that’s
one
of
the
arguments
your
opponent
makes,
and
i
didn’t
find
you
really
squarely
raise
that
in
the
trial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
suppose
the
question
is,
did
the
defendant
or
his
counsel
ever
specifically
advise
the
trial
judge
that
it
was
his
theory
that
the
wife
was
guilty
of
killing
the
child?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
didn’t
expect
her
to
say,
yes,
she
was
guilty,
did
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
did
you
make
an
effort,
in
sidebar
conference
or
whatever
florida
procedure
provides
in
a
case
like
that,
to
show
that
regardless
of
the
general
rule
that
the
trial
judge
in
this
case,
after
what
you
had
shown,
should
make
an
exception
to
the
voucher
rule?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
seems
to
be
some
suggestion
that
perhaps
some
of
the
evidence
you
wanted
to
introduce
was
excludable
on
some
other
state
ground.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
only
ruling
of
the
court
that
there
ever
was.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
those
letters
ever
introduced
on
federal
habeas?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
weren’t
they,
do
you
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
carry
water
if
you
were
talking
about
a
party
to
an
action
who
had
some
standing
for
credibility;
but
on
this
record,
how
can
you
suggest
that
his
characterization
of
those
letters
would
be
better
than
the
original
documents?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
know;
but
most
people
will
make
an
offer
of
proof,
just
to
protect
their
offer.
but
the
letters
are
not
in
the
record;
that’s
my
real
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
find
it
more
difficult
to
understand
why
counsel,
having
them
in
his
possession,
did
not
produce
them
and
offer
them
or
at
least,
as
justice
white
suggests,
make
an
offer
of
proof
as
to
what
they
contained.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
yet
it’s
your
burden
to
convince
the
court
on
a
petition
for
federal
habeas
that
some
wrong
has
been
done
here,
isn’t
it?
you
can’t
turn
around
and
say,
“well,
gee,
if
we
had
only
known,
we
would
have
supplied
the
necessary
evidence.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
were
they
ever
marked
as
exhibits?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understand,
i
understand.
do
you
have
a
proceeding
in
florida
whereby
an
item
to
be
offered
in
evidence
is
first
marked
for
identification
and
then
offered
in
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
had
these
letters
been
marked
for
identification,
but
not
admitted
in
evidence,
or
had
they
not
even
been
marked
for
identification?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
here,
you
don’t
have
a
confession
at
all,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
resume
there
at
10:00
o’clock
tomorrow
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
our
arguments
in
maness
against
wainwright.
mr.
brummer,
i
think
you
have
17
minutes
remaining
of
your
time.
mr.
brummer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
every
attempt
is
something;
i
think
perhaps
you
have
done
a
better
job.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
you
reserve.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
berger.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
48.58,
you
have
one
minute
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
have
answered
the
question
abundantly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
disposition
to
announce
in
75-6909,
maness
against
wainwright
and
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
was
dismissed
as
having
been
improvidently
granted.
