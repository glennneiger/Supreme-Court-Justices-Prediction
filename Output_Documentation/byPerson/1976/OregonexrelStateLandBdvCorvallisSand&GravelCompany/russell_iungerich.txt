mr.
russell
iungerich
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
might
begin
by
thanking
the
state
of
oregon
for
permitting
state
of
california
and
the
29
other
states,
which
joint
it
advancing
the
position
expressed
in
our
amici
briefs
in
this
case.
an
opportunity
to
present
our
position
to
the
court
had
oral
argument.
our
position
is
it
neither
this
case
nor
the
earlier
decision
of
bonelli
cattle
company
v.
arizona,
presented
a
federal
question
arising
under
federal
common
law.
and
i
submit
that
this
is
a
very
critical
question
to
the
states.
until
bonelli,
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
rights
of
each
state
and
it
is
land,
navigable
waters
within
each
state’s
boundaries,
were
questions
of
state
law
exclusively
confided
to
state
courts
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
hughes
v.
washington,
your
honor
i
submit,
relied
upon
a
construction
of
a
federal
patent
and
it
is
a
question
there,
it
involved
the
federal
patent
and
the
boundary
that
we
were
talking
about.
we
are
talking
about
actually
defining
one
of
the
boundaries
of
a
federal
patent
where
you
have
a
federal
patent
and
the
construction
of
that
patent
and
its
scope
and
giving
a
force
and
effect
such
as
in
use
or
in
borax
question,
we
concede
that
there
is
a
federal
question.
however,
the
normal
rule
is
under
joy
v.
city
of
st.
louis,
which
is
mentioned
in
one
of
the
amici
briefs,
is
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
federal
patent
was
the
source
of
title
does
not
conferred
jurisdiction
on
any
court.
there
has
to
be
an
issue
about
construction.
in
this
case
there
was
no
issue
of
construction
of
the
patent;
the
issue
here
is
the
effect
of
a
change
brought
about
by
a
flood
on
the
willamette
river.
we
submit
that,
that
is
a
question
purely
and
simply
of
state
law,
what
the
effect
of
that
change
was?
now,
effectively
what
we
are
arguing
for
is
with
regard,
we
submit
it
first
under
the
equal-footing
doctrine.
the
equal-footing
doctrine
is
properly
interpreted,
leaves
to
the
state
courts
the
right
to
determine
under
their
own
rules
of
property
and
in
their
own
forum,
all
questions
with
regard
to
the
beds
of
navigable
rivers
and
all
questions
with
regard
to
the
changes
in
those
beds
that
occurred
later.
simply
stated
that
means
that
all
these
questions
are
state
law
questions
as
we
see
them.
an
alternative
view,
we
believe
essentially
that,
that
construction
is
the
proper.
an
alternative,
and
perhaps
equally
acceptable
construction
to
the
states
that
argue
is
amici,
is
about
if
the
equal-footing
doctrine
does
confer
jurisdiction
under
the
federal
constitution
on
this
court,
it
confers
it
to
define
what
the
incidence
of
sovereignty
are
and
no
more.
it
does
not
confer
a
basis
for
determining
questions
under
federal
common
law,
and
to
explain
that
point
and
what
i
mean
by
that
is
this.
the
court
could
say
that
as
of
the
date
of
admission
to
the
union,
the
states
involved
by
under
the
equal-footing
doctrine
were
vested
with
the
fee
simple
title
in
the
beds
of
all
navigable
rivers
as
to
wherever
those
beds
might
move
in
the
future.
however,
relying
on
the
analysis
of
bonelli,
the
effect
of
that
decision
would
be
that
it
would
quite
title
to
the
beds
of
navigable
rivers
in
all
states.
in
the
state,
in
full
proprietary
and
all
other
sovereign
aspects
and
would
do
so
as
a
matter
constitutional
law
no
longer
bringing
cases
like
this
before
this
court.
because
any
effect
of
where
the
river
happened
to
be
flowing
and
change
by
a
flood
would
live
those
cases
out
of
court.
however,
if
bonelli
is
applied
under
those
circumstances
it
would
mean;
state
cannot
rely
upon
the
equal-footing
doctrine
as
a
source
of
title
for
relicted
beds
or
reemerged
land.
but
we
submit
that
still
does
not
present
a
federal
question.
what
it
creates
is
a
title
vacuum,
and
that
is
really
what
the
issue
was
in
bonelli.
in
other
words,
the
court
as
we
see
it
should
have
gone
no
further
than
to
decide
in
bonelli
that
equal-footing
did
not
confer
title
on
the
state?
it
should
not
then
have
gone
and
created
a
federal
common
law
rule,
which
disposed
of
the
relicted
bed
of
the
river
and
granted
it
to
bonelli
cattle
company.
because
the
question
there
presented
is
really
a
question
of
state
law
as
the
cases
of
this
court
indicate.
the
effects
of
accretion,
the
effects
of
avulsion,
the
effects
of
reliction,
all
of
those
questions
have
always
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
questions
for
the
state
courts,
not
questions
for
the
federal
courts
to
determine.
and
we
submit
that
the
basis
for
this
second
alternative
is
essentially
that
when
you
decide
that
equal-footing
determines
that
there
was
no
claim
in
bonelli.
that
equal-footing
could
be
a
basis
for
the
state’s
title.
really
it
should
be
up
to
the
state
court
to
decide
the
disposition
of
the
property
in
question
at
that
point,
because
the
third
section
of
the
bonelli
opinion
begins
by
stating
the
question
that
remains
is
asked
to
who
owns
the
subject
land
under
the
applicable
federal
common
law.
i
submit
however,
that
the
parties
in
bonelli,
and
having
read
the
briefs,
i
submit
this,
indicated
that
there
was
no
difference
between
state
and
federal
law
in
this
case
and
they
did
not
bring
out
any
source
of
federal
jurisdiction
for
creating
a
federal
common
law
or
principle.
we
are
told
in
erie
railroad
v.
tompkins
that
there
is
no
longer
any
general
federal
common
law.
so
we
must
look
to
one
of
the
several
sources
of
specialized
common
law.
none
of
them,
which
our
brief
points
out
are
applicable
in
the
case
of
the
federal
common
law
rules
created
in
the
bonelli
decision
and
i
think
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
the
court
did
not
rely
on
the
interstate
boundary
in
bonelli,
and
i
would
point
out
that
we
were
only
talking
about
land
that
was
wholly
within
arizona
and
bonelli.
another
words,
we
were
talking
about
arizona
owned
from
the
middle
of
the
river
to
the
new
high
water
mark.
mr.
russell
iungerich
it
had
at
one
time,
well,
it
is
still
is
the
interstate
boundary.
mr.
russell
iungerich
the
channel,
the
river.
i
do
not
know
exactly
the
effect
of
the
compact
between
arizona
and
california
on
that
point.
at
this
precise
location,
which
of
course
affects
that,
but
the
interstate
boundary
was
not
the
critical
question.
if
it
were,
we
would
not
be
here
because
i
would
submit
if
there
is
an
interstate
boundary
and
you
are
talking
about
a
conflict
between
two
states
over
an
interstate
boundary
that
is
one
of
the
areas
where
specialized
federal
common
law
does
apply.
and
we
would
agree
under
those
circumstances.
but
it
was
land
wholly
within
arizona;
it
was
the
land
between
the
new
high
water
mark
and
the
old
high
water
mark.
and,
there
was
a
question
purely
and
simply
of
state
law
that
should
have
been
applied.
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
think
the
state
could
so
hope,
yes.
mr.
russell
iungerich
that
is
right.
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
i
do
believe.
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
think
the
reason
for
that
is
the
whole
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
your
honor
because
the
whole
purpose
of
protecting
the
public’s
rights,
the
commerce,
navigation
and
fisheries
depends
as
the
cases
of
this
board
teaches
upon
the
ownership
of
the
bed.
the
two
are
related,
and
so
the
state
holds
that
bed
in
trust
to
protect
those
public
purposes
and
it
really
makes
no
sense
to
talk
about
the
state
not
owning
the
bed
of
a
major
artery
such
as
the
willamette
river,
a
major
navigable
river
which
is
so
important
to
commerce
and
to
a
state
and
to
its
public.
so
that
you
have
some
portions
that
are
held
in
private
ownership
and
other
portions
that
are
held
in
public
ownership.
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
think
the
state
of
oregon
could
so
decide,
and
under
those
circumstances
many
states
such
as
i
believe
wisconsin
and
illinois
have
taken
the
position
that
the
riparian
land
owner
owns
to
the.
mr.
russell
iungerich
middle
of
the
stream
and
if
the
state
decides
to
do
that,
i
submit
that
is
within
the
state’s
prerogative.
but
the
problem
here
is
whether
or
not
a
federal
common
law
rule
should
compel
that
result
that
the
state
gave
up
title
to
the
bed
of
the
river,
and
that
is
i
think
the
critical
issue
of
state
sovereignty
that
is
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
russell
iungerich
they
got
part
of
the
land,
yes.
the
question
is
the
remainder.
thank
you.
