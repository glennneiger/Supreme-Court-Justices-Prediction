justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mix,
isn’t
one
of
the
underlying
issues
in
the
case
at
least
if
you
take
some
of
the
amicus
briefs
that
a
question
of
what
law
governs
on
this
issue
of
title
whether
it
is
oregon
law
or
federal
common
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
bonelli
is
distinguished
below
its
fact,
isn’t
it?
there
you
were
dealing
with
what
had
been
an
interstate
boundary
and
the
court
in
its
original
jurisdiction
cases
had
always
treated
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law.
but,
the
willamette
river
at
corvallis
has
never
been
an
interstate
boundary.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
your
first
basis
for
jurisdiction
were
federal
jurisdiction,
the
idea
that
the
land
was
originally
patented
by
the
federal
government
were
adequate
to
sustain
it.
any
real
property
dispute
that
a
role
is
west
of
the
appellation
mountains
you
could
bring
in
federal
court,
could
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
analogize
that
situation
to
a
case
where
oregon
had
received
lands
from
the
federal
government
at
the
time
of
statehood,
which
were
unrestricted
(inaudible)
and
turned
around
and
conveyed
them
to
private
individuals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
‘above’,
do
you
mean
upstream
from
or
downstream
from?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
if
we
were
to
adopt
your
restricted
definition
of
navigability,
so
that
bonelli
would
not
apply,
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
could
still
develop
its
own
body
of
law,
could
it
not
as
to
whether
or
not
you,
your
client,
or
the
state
own
this
particular
land?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
trying
to
avoid
the
application
of
bonelli,
as
i
understand
your
argument
by
limiting
the
definition
of
navigability,
is
that
correct?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
reason
and
for
wanting
a
narrow
definition
of
navigability?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
doesn’t
that
prove
what
i
just
asked
you
that
you
a
want
a
narrow
definition
of
navigability
so
that
bonelli
will
have
less
application?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
okay
then,
supposing
we
were
to
conclude
for
one
reason
under
that
bonelli
did
not
govern
this
case,
then
wouldn’t
it
be
up
to
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
to
decide
by
oregon
law
who
got
the
proper
that
is
in
conflict
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
subject
to
constitutional
limitations
but
to
what
body
of
real
property
law
would
you
look
if
bonelli
were
not
applicable
to
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
interstate
boundaries?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
river
had
been
at
one
time
the
interstate
boundary
had
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
channeling?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
deny
that
the
oregon
courts
could
conclude
as
a
matter
of
oregon
law
that
the
state
of
oregon
did
not
have
title
to
this
river
or
to
the
bed
of
the
river?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
according
to
the
findings
that
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
you
could
certainly
tell
the
day
that
fischer’s
cut
began
to
carry
the
majority
of
the
stream.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
nobody
has
been
there
in
the
case
of
most
things
it
has
been
found
to
be
avulsion,
it
is
all
a
bunch
of
early
settlers
or
indians
testifying
about
boats
going
up
and
down
the
river
and
that
sort
of
things,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
there
is
a
respectable
authority
contrary
to
your
position.
as
in
the
various
state
courts
would
you
treat
my
questions
in
one
of
the
state
law
in
certain
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you
are
asking
for
a
change
in
the
bonelli
doctrine,
aren’t
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
cannot
do
that
and
leave
bonelli
completely
intact,
can
we?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
herman,
you
say
this
was
not
a
classical
avulsion,
it
is
certainly
was
not
a
classical
accretion
neither
was
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
also
know
there
was
a
precise
point
in
time
at
which
one
channel
seize
to
bare
the
main
part
of
the
current
than
the
other
one
did
from
the
findings
to
the
court
doing
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
court
in
barney
say
what
its
authority
was
for
deciding
the
matter
as
a
federal
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
a
diversity
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
conceivably
it
could
have
been
in
this
swift
v.
tyson
days,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
a
point
near
corvallis
oregon,
a
company
called
corvallis
sand
&
gravel
company,
had
been
digging
for
many
years
in
the
riverbed
of
the
willamette
river
without
a
lease
from
the
state.
the
state
of
oregon
sued
corvallis
stand
and
his
sand
in
the
oregon
state
courts
claiming
that
it
owned
the
land
in
question.
he
had
asked
for
an
injunction
and
for
damages.
included
in
the
lawsuit
was
language
lay
under
the
river
in
an
area
known
as
fischer
cut.
this
land
was
formally
an
overflow
channel
of
high
stages
of
that
river,
but
after
a
major
flood
in
november
1909,
the
main
channel
of
the
river
was
directly
through
fischer
cut.
applying
traditional
principles
derived
from
the
english
common
law,
the
oregon
trial
court
decided
it
is
a
matter
of
state
law
that
the
change
of
the
river's
course
had
been
rapid
and
violent
was
therefore
an
abolition
and
rather
than
an
accretion
and
awarded
title
to
the
land
to
corvallis
sand
is
against
the
state.
this
decision
was
appealed
in
the
oregon
court
of
appeals.
in
the
meantime,
our
decision
in
bonelli
cattle
versus
arizona,
three
terms
ago
was
handed
out.
in
bonelli,
the
state
of
arizona
ands
a
private
landowner
had
disputed
title
to
land
which
had
been
submerged
by
the
movement
of
the
colorado
river,
but
which
it
later
emerged,
reemerged
to
his
dry
land.
we
held
in
bonelli
that
the
dispute
should
be
determined
under
the
doctrines
of
federal
rather
than
state
law
because
of
what
is
called
the
equal-footing
doctrine
under
which
new
states
are
admitted
to
the
union.
the
oregon
appellate
court
in
this
case
still
bound
by
bonelli
to
decide
this
dispute
faced
upon
its
understanding
of
federal
law
and
then
accordingly
awarded
title
to
corvallis
sand.
we
have
carefully
examined
bonelli
in
considering
the
petition
and
cross-petition
for
certiorari
here,
and
i
have
concluded
that
its
result
was
incorrect
and
it
should
be
overruled.
we
are
convinced
from
our
view
of
cases
decided
by
this
court
over
period
of
nearly
a
150
years
that
state
law
should
govern
in
situation
such
as
this.
the
equal-footing
doctrine
does
not
provide
a
basis
for
the
application
of
federal
law
since
that
doctrine
simply
address
title
to
riverbeds
in
the
states,
a
title
which
cannot
be
later
defeated
under
any
principle
of
federal
law.
our
case
has
have
held
that
state
law
governs
property
disputes
and
dispositions
of
lands
at
a
boundary
of
a
river.
while
we
recognized
the
waiting
considerations
which
argue
against
overruling
of
recent
case
such
as
bonelli,
we
are
somewhat
fortified
in
our
decision
to
do
so
by
our
conviction
that
our
holding
today
returns
the
state
of
the
law
to
the
place
where
it
rested
before
bonelli.
we
thus
remand
the
case
to
the
oregon
courts
for
reconsideration
of
the
issues
in
light
of
state
law.
mr.
justice
marshall

mr.
justice
white

filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
brennan

separate
statement
of
dissent.
