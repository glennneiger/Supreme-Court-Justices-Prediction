e.

we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
75-567
and
577,
oregon
v.
corvallis
sand
&
gravel
and
the
related
case.
mr.
mix
may
you
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
i
ot
understand
you
say
that
at
no
time
as
sand
&
gravel
company
every
interfered
or
conducted
activities
that
would
interfere
with
these
various
rights?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
argument
is
that
the
bed
is
still
the
bed
even
if
some
of
the
surface
material
is
taken
off
of
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
mix.
mr.
yurinick.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
herman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
are
you
suggesting
that
we
modify
or
reexamine
at
least
to
merely
the
dicta
in
bonelli?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
oregon
law,
mr.
herman,
is
the
determination
of
an
avulsive
change
of
mixed
question
of
the
law
in
fact.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
we
have
any
authority
to
draw
different
inferences
and
conclusions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
when
--
does
this
court
ordinarily
reexamine
the
highest
courts
of
the
state
on
the
determination
of
the
state
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
just
taking
one-step
at
a
time.
on
state
law
we
do
not
reexamine,
do
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
what
you
are
suggesting
now,
is
that
because
the
federal
question
is
at
least
hovering
here
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
yet,
then
we
can
say
that
this
was
not
an
impulsive
change,
because
it
took
at
least
three
years
for
it
to
occur.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
at
least
three.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
are
not
here
at
all.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
herman.
mr.
mix
you
have
about
nine
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
75-567
and
the
related
case,
oregon
state
land
board
against
corvallis
sand
&
gravel
would
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
