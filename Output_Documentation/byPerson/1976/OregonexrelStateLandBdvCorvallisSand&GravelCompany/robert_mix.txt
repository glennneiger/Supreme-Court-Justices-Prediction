mr.
robert
mix
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
gentlemen,
i
am
robert
mix
appearing
here
on
behalf
of
corvallis
sand
&
gravel
company.
the
issues
in
the
case
are
essentially
the
following.
those
made
by
the
state
are:
was
the
change
in
channel
of
the
willamette
river
from
a
loop
approximately
three
miles
in
length
to
a
basically
straight
channel
across
the
neck
of
the
loop
avulsive.
in
that
connection,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
land
involved
in
this
case
is
not
only
the
changed
channel
but
a
portion
of
the
river
as
it
had
historically
flowed
in
its
natural
pit.
the
other
issue
made
by
the
state
is
whether
or
not
the
change
of
channel
transferred
private
dry
land
to
the
state
is
fee
simple,
by
virtue
of
the
presence
of
the
water,
which
had
submerged
the
private
land.
the
issues
made
by
corvallis
sand
are
the
following.
does
the
state
has
sufficient
title
to
maintain
ejectment,
to
recover
the
bed
of
the
river
when
its
title
is
based
on
sovereignty
and
when
there
is
no
issue
in
the
case
as
to
interference
with
the
public
right
of
navigation
and
fishery
by
corvallis
sand?
in
this
connection,
the
sand
&
gravel
materials
that
were
removed
from
the
river,
were
removed
under
permits
issued
by
the
core
of
engineers.
the
second
issue
made
by
corvallis
sand,
does
the
state
by
virtue
of
its
sovereignty
has
sufficient
title
to
recover
money
damages
for
removal
by
corvallis
sand
of
sand
and
gravel
materials
from
the
bed
of
the
stream.
again,
there
being
no
issue
as
to
interference
with
navigation
or
fishery
by
corvallis
sand.
in
support
of
its
position
--
mr.
robert
mix
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
my
understanding
of
the
bonelli
decision
that
we
are
now
in
an
area
to
be
controlled
by
federal
common
law
and
that
decision
is
at
the
core
of
the
courts
receiving
this
case,
and
the
court
is
expelled
out
as
a
matter
of
common
law
the
extent
of
the
state’s
title.
mr.
robert
mix
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
as
to
the
willamette
river,
it
is
my
understanding
of
bonelli
that
the
court
said
that
first
the
state’s
title
to
the
bed
is
a
limited
title,
that
the
state’s
interest
in
the
bed
must
be
related
to
navigation.
third,
that
that
title
is
determinable
if
the
navigable
aspect
of
the
use
of
the
bed
ceases.
fourthly,
that
the
state’s
interest
in
the
bed
is
“as
a
bed”,
and
in
that
connection,
the
court
sighted
that
the
case
of
state
v.
gill
from
alabama,
in
which
the
alabama
court
held
that
the
state
holds
title
to
the
bed
“as
a
bed”
and
not
to
the
individual
grains
of
sand
or
lumps
of
mud.
the
first
basis
on
which
corvallis
sand
claims
that
the
state
cannot
maintain
the
ejectment,
is
that
the
common
law
concept
of
the
ownership
of
the
beds
of
navigable
fresh
water
streams
controls
in
this
situation.
that
doctrine
was
announced
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
jones
v.
soulard,
decided
in
1860.
oregon
was
admitted
to
the
union
in
1859,
and
it
is
submitted
that
as
of
the
time
oregon
became
a
state,
the
common
law
controlled
the
ownership
of
the
beds
of
navigable
streams
and
under
the
common
law,
the
state
interest
did
not
extend
above
tide
water.
mr.
robert
mix
your
honor,
it
is
not
made
clear
in
the
decision.
as
to
jurisdiction,
we
take
the
position
there
is
jurisdiction
here.
all
the
property
that
has
been
involved
in
this
case
originally
was
patented
out
by
the
federal
government.
secondly,
on
the
basis
of
the
equal-footing
doctrine,
which
was
a
basis
for
jurisdiction
also
as
i
understand
it
in
the
bonelli
case.
also
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
the
willamette
river
is
navigable,
and
i
hope
to
talk
about
that
later
at
least
until
the
bonelli
decision.
also
on
the
basis
that
the
oregon
courts
ruling,
which
in
effect
said
that
the
state
has
a
fee
simple
title
to
the
bed
is
contrary
to
bonelli.
mr.
robert
mix
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
court
has
stated
this
as
a
basis
for
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
mix
in
hughes
v.
washington
and
also
in
borax
limited.
and
also
as
i
--
well,
not
in
bonelli.
no
i
do
not
think
the
federal
aspect.
the
federal
patent
aspect
is
mentioned
in
bonelli.
now,
your
honor,
my
recollection
maybe
in
errand
--
apparently,
it
is.
it
was
not
my
understanding
that
bonelli
involved
a
boundary
between
two
states.
another
basis
for
jurisdiction
is
the
problem
of
due
process.
this
again,
i
hope
to
discuss
later,
but
it
is
on
the
basis
that
the
riparians
became
vested
with
certain
rights
that
they
were
granted
under
the
common
law
and
that
those
rights
have
been
divested
and
particularly
in
this
situation,
and
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
states
--
at
least
i
have
not
questioned
jurisdiction
in
previous
cases.
continuing
with
the
basis
of
corvallis
or
the
common
law
as
being
controlling
here,
under
the
common
law,
the
state
had
no
interest
in
the
beds
of
navigable
fresh
water
streams.
again,
oregon
became
a
state
in
1859
and
the
common
law
was
controlling,
in
my
view,
until
at
least
1876.
when
the
court
gave
the
opinion
in
barney
v.
keokuk,
the
patents
involved
in
this
case
are
dated
approximately
1853,
1859,
1865,
and
one
of
them
involving
one
small
government
lot
is
dated
1883.
however,
that
was
a
homestead,
not
a
donation
land
claim
and
the
entryman
had
made
his
entry
in
his
filing
in
1875.
we
took
the
position
in
the
oregon
courts
that
his
riparian
rights
related
back
to
1875,
which
would
be
before
barney
v.
keokuk.
the
oregon
court
rejected
that
position.
the
oregon
court
did
not,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
until
1908,
in
the
case
of
hume
v.
rogue
river
packing
company
make
a
ruling
that
the
beds
of
navigable
fresh
water
streams
belong
to
the
state.
and,
by
that
time,
all
of
these
rights
had
been
vested.
the
oregon
legislature
did
not
until
1967
pass
a
statute
claiming
that
the
state
owned
the
beds
of
navigable
fresh
water
rivers.
now
the
second
and
alternative
ground
for
ownership
by
corvallis
sand
is
as
follows.
accepting
the
line
of
decisions
of
the
court
which
began
with
barney
v.
keokuk
in
1876
that
the
state
owns
the
bed
of
navigable
fresh
water
streams,
but
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
grant
to
the
riparian,
whatever
portion
of
that
title
it
wishes.
in
applying
that
line
of
decisions,
it
is
our
position
that
in
1859,
when
oregon
became
a
state
by
constitutional
provision
yet
adopted
the
common
law.
this
was
accomplished
by
continuing
enforce
of
the
statutes
of
the
territory
and,
one
of
those
statutes
made
the
common
law
controlling
in
oregon.
then
it
is
our
position
that
in
1859
oregon,
even
though
it
owned
the
beds
of
the
navigable
fresh
water
streams,
made
an
election
to
apply
the
common
law
and
that
the
riparian
received
his
traditional
rights
and
that
it
is
a
denial
of
due
process
to
now
try
to
take
those
rights
away
from
him.
mr.
robert
mix
yes,
your
honor.
in
that
situation,
i
assume
we
are
talking
about
lieu
lands,
and
in
that
situation,
the
state
of
oregon
would
be
in
the
position
of
a
private
land
owner.
when
it
granted,
if
it
gave
land
that
was
riparian,
and
did
not
reserve
any
rights
from
the
deed.
the
entire
title
would
pass
including
the
traditional
common
law
of
riparian
rights.
the
third
basis
for
the
position
that
the
state
cannot
maintain
the
ejectment
is
based
on
bonelli,
which
approaches
in
many
ways,
at
least
in
my
view,
the
common
law
and
again,
bonelli
held
the
state’s
title
is
limited.
it
must
be
related
to
navigation,
it
is
determinable,
the
state’s
interest
in
the
bed
is
as
a
bed
and
my
interpretation
of
that
is
that
as
part
of
the
navigational
servitude.
the
public
would
have
the
right
to
anchor
on
the
bed
as
part
of
the
fishing
servitude
for
example,
it
would
have
the
right
to
way
down
the
bed,
to
have
used
the
bed
for
spawning
salmon
and
so
on.
but,
that
it
is
not
proprietary.
on
the
basis
of
the
--
mr.
robert
mix
yes,
your
honor,
and
my
basis
for
saying
them
is
this.
the
core
of
engineers,
under
the
commerce
clause
issued
permits
for
removal
of
sand
&
gravel
materials
and
it
is
our
position
those
permits
would
not
be
if
--
that
the
court
would
not
issue
those
permits
if
navigation
were
being
interfered
with.
and
the
second
basis
is
that
the
state
at
no
time
pleaded
or
offered
any
evidence
that
there
was
any
interference
with
navigation
or
fishery,
throughout
the
case
we
have
maintained
there
was
no
interference,
and
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
a
state
has
never
said
there
was
any
interference.
the
fourth
ground
relates
solely
to
the
judgment
for
money
damages
recovered
by
the
state
and
the
state
recovered
a
judgment
based
on
the
number
of
cubic
yards
of
material
removed
from
the
river.
at
common
law
the
riparian
had
the
right
to
remove
sand
&
gravel
so
long
as
he
did
not
interfere
with
the
public
rights.
bonelli,
holds
again,
the
state
owns
the
bed
as
a
bed
citing
state
v.
gill,
and
then
gill,
the
alabama
court
said,
“the
title
to
the
state
does
not
extend
to
the
individual
grains
of
sand
or
lumps
of
mud”.
and
on
that
basis,
we
submit
that
the
proprietary
right
of
removing
sand
&
gravel
is
not
owned
by
the
state,
but
belongs
to
the
riparian
and
the
state
cannot
recover
damages.
mr.
robert
mix
yes,
your
honor,
and
as
a
matter
of
river
hydraulics,
the
river
normally
replaces
the
sand
&
gravel
you
remove
it
in
the
next
spring
or
in
the
next
high
water,
it
washes
more
material
though.
there
is
a
related
matter,
it
is
not
an
issue
directly
but
it
is
important
and
that
is
the
definition
of
navigable
or
navigability.
there
is
no
question,
but
that
in
1971
when
this
case
was
tried,
that
the
definition
of
navigable
applied
to
any
stream
which
had
historically
been
navigated
irrespective
of
subsequent
events.
the
willamette
river
was
used
in
the
early
days
as
the
main
artery
of
commerce
in
the
willamette
river,
and
again,
i
am
referring
to
the
area
above
corvallis,
which
is
the
disputed
part.
mr.
robert
mix
upstream
from
corvallis,
your
honor.
but
at
the
end
of
the
rail
road
and
the
truck,
commerce
disappeared.
today
the
stream
is
used,
fishermen
floating
down
or
people
floating
down
canoes
and
inner
tubes
and
such.
the
historical
definitions
of
navigable
are
derived
from
two
sources.
first,
in
the
genesee
chief
in
1851,
the
court
for
purposes
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
held
that
admiralty
jurisdiction
does
extend
to
navigable
fresh
water.
in
1870,
in
the
case
of
daniel
ball,
the
court
held
it
for
purposes
of
the
commerce
clause.
navigable
is
to
be
defined
as
far
as
fresh
water
is
concerned,
as
all
streams
or
bodies,
which
are
capably
of
being
used
commercially
for
trade
and
travel.
now,
the
law
has
been
undisputed
until
bonelli
that
if
a
stream
was
historically
navigable
the
state’s
ownership
continued.
it
is
submitted
that
definitions
of
navigability,
for
purposes
of
the
commerce
clause
and
for
purposes
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
should
be
brought
for
protection
of
the
public.
however,
when
we
come
to
define
navigable,
for
the
purpose
of
taking
from
the
riparian
his
rights
and
giving
those
to
the
state,
the
definition
should
be
restrictive,
and
a
suggested
definition
is
that
a
stream
will
be
considered
navigable
for
purposes
of
the
state’s
interest
in
the
stream.
so
long
as
it
continues
to
be
usable
for
commercial
purposes
of
trade
and
travel,
and
the
lament
at
this
time,
in
my
judgment
at
least
is
not
suitable
for
that
purpose.
now
bonelli
--
mr.
robert
mix
the
idea
of
the
continuing
navigability
is
new
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
the
bonelli
--
mr.
robert
mix
let
me
make
it
very
clear,
the
last
thing
corvallis
sand
wants
to
do
is
to
try
to
defeat
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
the
stream
was
navigable,
the
court
found
it
was
navigable,
our
trial
court,
and
i
stipulated
that
it
was
navigable
and
it
was
navigable.
my
concern
is
this.
the
states
have
liberalized
this
definition
of
navigable
for
the
purpose
of
claiming
ownership
to
additional
land.
and
bonelli,
at
least
implies
that
the
states’
interest
ceases
if
the
land
ceases
to
be
necessary
for
purposes
of
navigation.
mr.
robert
mix
that
is
not
my
understanding,
your
honor.
the
definition
of
navigability
or
navigable
as
for
the
federal
courts,
and
it
is
along
the
line
of
decisions
holding
this.
secondly,
again,
and
i
only
state
my
understanding
of
bonelli.
my
understanding
of
bonelli
is
that
it
said
that
this
area
of
the
law
in
the
future
is
to
be
the
subject
of
federal
common
law.
the
situation
there
was
a
very
limited
situation
involving
some
dry
land,
which
had
been
artificially
accreted.
again,
it
is
my
understanding
that
here
we
are
seeking
to
explore
what
law
should
be
applicable
on
a
broader
scale
--
mr.
robert
mix
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
my
position.
mr.
robert
mix
for
this
reason,
your
honor,
again
the
states
have
taken
upon
themselves
to
liberalize
the
definition
to
take
on
more
property.
and
again,
if
my
understanding
of
bonelli
is
correct,
the
implication
at
least
is
that
the
state’s
interest
only
continues
so
long
as
the
water
is
usable
for
purposes
of
navigation.
mr.
robert
mix
well,
it
would
limit
the
--
shall
we
say
the
land
area
under
water
in
that
sense?
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
mix
not,
if
my
understanding
is
correct
your
honor
that
we
also
have
a
problem
of
due
process
here,
in
the
sense
that
these
rights
became
vested.
mr.
robert
mix
your
honor,
prior
to
bonelli
the
states
had
free
reigned
to
decide
what
they
chose.
excuse
me!
i
have
requested
to
reserve
ten
minutes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
mix
thank
you,
your
honor.
clearing
up
one
basis
fact
matter,
the
land
in
dispute
can
be
divided
into
two
types.
a
comparably
small
portion
of
it
was
under
the
channel
that
is
being
disputed
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
revolted.
the
balance
of
it,
upstream
was
in
the
original
bed
of
the
river
and
i
submit
this
creates
two
different
problems.
my
concern
here
is
apply
to
the
riparian.
being
very
candid,
if
the
court
had
not
starting
with
barney
v.
keokuk,
handed
down
a
line
of
decisions
under
federal
authority
taking
the
ownership
of
the
bed
from
the
riparian
and
giving
it
to
the
state.
we
would
not
be
here
today,
because
all
states
except
louisiana
adopted
the
common
law,
and
there
was
no
question
as
to
what
the
common
law
meant.
it
was
only
when
the
court
said
the
states
own
the
beds
but
they
may
decide
what
disposition
are
going
make
of
them,
that
we
found
ourselves
in
the
situation
we
are
in
today.
on
that
basis,
bonelli
becomes
very
important
because
it
points
the
way
to
a
return
to
what
was
the
law
of
the
land
and
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
in
1876
when
barney
was
decided,
38
states
had
already
been
admitted
to
the
union
and
in
the
territories
not
yet
granted
statehood.
it
is
safe
to
assume
that
the
principle
riparian
land
had
been
occupied.
mr.
robert
mix
it
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
mix
it
was
not
as
my
understanding
--
it
could
have
been,
it
was
a
railroad
case
and
the
railroad
might
not
have
been
a
resident
but
the
case
does
not
say
that.
mr.
robert
mix
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
case,
your
honor.
again,
by
1876
most
of
the
important
riparian
land
in
this
country
was
occupied
by
riparians;
and
then
barney
v.
keokuk
was
handed
down
and
the
riparian
started
to
have
his
rights
taken
away
from
him.
and
again,
emphasizing
the
due
process
aspect,
there
is
even
more
than
that.
there
is
the
problem
of
the
court
taking
jurisdiction
a
hundred
years
ago
and
if
it
is
now
are
going
to
be
declared
that
the
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction,
the
riparian
is
left
at
the
mercy
of
the
states.
and
there
is
a
very
practical
aspect
of
this.
stating
this
hypothetically,
but
it
is
very
real.
we
take
a
riparian
in
state
a,
and
state
a
supreme
court
has
decided
as
oregon
has
and
as
mr.
herman
says
that
the
riparian
has
no
right
to
below
high
water.
immediately
across
this
navigable
river
is
state
b,
and
state
b
is
ruled
that
the
riparian
owns
the
middle
of
the
stream.
they
are
both
under
the
common
law;
they
are
both
under
applicable
constitutions.
how
in
that
situation
do
we
explain
to
a
the
state
can
actually
come
in
and
take
the
portion
of
the
bed
in
front
of
your
river
or
of
your
property.
sell
it
off
so
as
long
as
it
does
not
interfere
with
navigation
and
let
us
take
between
high
and
low
of
the
water
for
example.
someone
can
sell
it
in,
build
a
building
and
you
a
have
no
rights
left.
now
there
at
least,
while
bonelli
is
in
dispute
here,
there
is
certainly
one
thing
said
in
bonelli
that
should
not
in
my
judgment
be
in
dispute.
and
that
is
that
riparian
thus
is
important,
and
there
is
no
reason
under
our
jurisprudence
pursuing
to
a
riparian,
you
do
not
occupy
the
same
status
as
other
property
owners
in
this
country.
there
is
no
reason
to
discriminate
against
the
riparian
when
the
courts
are
dedicated
to
protecting
the
property
rights
in
other
types
of
situations.
the
common
law
as
it
applied
until
at
least
1876
would
resolve
all
of
these
problems.
we
would
not
have
argue
--
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
mix
referring
to
at
least
two
decisions
of
this
court,
the
borax
limited
case
and
the
hughes
case.
mr.
robert
mix
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
mix
we
are
contending
your
honor,
yes.
we
are
the
owners
by
mean
conveyances
of
the
property,
which
was
originally
patented
out
by
the
federal
government.
and
it
is
our
position
that
when
that
property
was
received
from
the
federal
government
as
part
of
it
the
riparian
rights
passed,
and
that
we
have
succeeded
to
those
rights
by
the
mean
conveyances.
and
that
this
a
matter
of
federal
law
in
interpreting
that
patent
that
the
state
cannot
come
along
and
say,
“now
even
though
you
have
a
federal
patent,
you
have
got
nothing
beyond
the
high
water
mark”.
again,
very
briefly,
the
common
law
if
it
is
applied
we
will
not
have
these
problems
of
avulsion,
what
is
navigable,
it
is
a
very
simple
matter
to
determine
the
head
of
tide
water.
turning
briefly
to
the
state
the
matters
of
the
state
has
raised.
the
law
goes
back
to
the
romans,
that
if
a
river
changes
its
channel
and
flows
over
private
property,
the
private
land
owner
does
not
lose
his
title.
we
are
not
talking
about
riparian
rights,
we
are
talking
about
the
law
of
submergence.
and
the
riparian
continues
to
maintain
title
subject
to
the
public
navigational
servitude
and
disagreeing
with
california’s
position,
the
state
does
not
need
fee
title
to
the
bed
to
protect
the
public
and
we
know
this
is
true,
because
approximately
20
states
within
this
country
the
state
has
declared
or
has
adopted
the
common
law
and
the
riparian
owns
the
bed.
and
there
is
no
record
to
my
knowledge
of
the
riparian
successfully
interfering
with
the
public
rights.
mr.
robert
mix
yes,
to
the
avulsive
channel,
yes
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
and
this
is
an
illustration
of
the
lack
of
need
of
fee
title
in
the
state
and
what
we
are
disputing
here
really
is
proprietary
rights
of
the
riparian
on
the
one
hand
versus
the
right
of
the
public
to
use
the
water
on
the
other.
and
there
is
no
real
conflict
except
that
one
is
created
hypothetically
by
saying,
well,
we
hold
it
in
trust
but
i
submit
that
is
a
misapplication
of
the
trust
doctrine.
thank
you.
