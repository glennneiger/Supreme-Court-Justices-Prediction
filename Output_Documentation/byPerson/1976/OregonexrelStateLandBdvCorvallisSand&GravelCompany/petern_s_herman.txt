mr.
peter
herman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
peter
herman,
i
represent
the
attorney
general’s
office,
state
of
oregon
and
i
am
here
on
behalf
of
the
state
land
board.
i
feel
some
clarifying
statements
here
on
order
in
terms
of
stating
the
case,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
pages
40
and
41
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
brown
document.
the
chart
on
the
left
shows
the
river
as
it
was
in
1890,
and
the
court
will
note
two
points
a
and
b.
this
is
the
neck
of
the
peninsula,
and
the
overflow
channel
that
was
discovered
on
that
date.
the
photograph
or
the
channel
on
the
right,
page
41
it
shows
an
enlarged
overflow
channel
and
the
smaller
channel
going
around
the
oxbow.
that
was
a
river
as
an
existed
in
1911
after
the
change
took
place.
now,
the
holding
of
the
bonelli
cattle
company,
as
we
interpreted
the
decision,
was
that
public
title
follows
the
river
and
its
change
is
to
guarantee
full
public
use
and
enjoyment.
that
when
the
river
recedes
from
riparian
property,
the
exposed
land
is
no
longer
needed
by
the
state
for
public
purpose,
and
therefore
title
goes
to
the
riparian
owner,
and
whether
the
change
is
sudden
or
artificial,
acceptable
or
not,
makes
no
difference.
we
submit
that
the
rationale
should
be
applied
in
this
case
to
the
fact
involving
fischer
cut
and
in
any
event,
even
if
traditional
avulsion
doctrine
is
to
be
applied,
we
submit
as
a
matter
of
law
that
no
avulsion
did
in
fact
occur.
and
in
effect
what
the
court
is
being
called
upon
to
do
here
is
to
review
the
legal
conclusions
the
oregon
courts
drew
and
then
essentially
agreed
upon
factual
setting.
now,
what
happened
here
was
--
mr.
peter
herman
well,
as
far
as
this
--
mr.
peter
herman
we
are
not
raising
any
issues
as
to
parcels
that
the
state
was
awarded
title.
mr.
peter
herman
the
issues
we
are
talking
about
are
sensibly
parcels
2a,
2b
and
a
portion
of
parcel
three,
which
are
called
fischer
cut.
that
is
the
overflow
channel
that
the
court
sees
on
page
40
and
the
enlarged
channel
that
the
court
sees
on
page
41
with
the
word
‘fischer’
in
it.
over
a
20-year
period,
there
is
much
flooding,
recurrent
storms,
some
major
storms.
in
1890
this
channel
current
water
and
in
the
intermediate
stage
of
five
feet.
by
1906,
one-fourth
of
the
river
was
flowing
through
this
channel
at
the
four-foot
stage,
which
is
again
an
intermediate
stage.
there
were
some
more
major
storms,
and
by
november
--
sometime
after
november
25
of
1909,
the
main
flow
of
the
river
was
found
coursing
through
this
overflow
channel.
now,
the
trial
court
held
that
this
constitute
an
avulsion
that
the
change
was
sudden
and
violent.
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court
essentially
agreed,
and
ruled
that
the
state
had
no
title
to
the
bed
in
this
portion
of
the
river.
now
this
section
of
the
river
is
approximately
2,500
feet
long,
but
the
court
sent
the
case
back
to
the
trial
court
to
determine
the
precise
limits
of
the
avulsion.
now
the
issue
we
raised
in
our
petition
is
whether
under
these
facts,
it
was
proper
for
the
court
to
conclude
that
an
avulsion
did
occur,
and
that
the
public
did
not
have
a
title
in
this
bed.
stated
in
other
way,
we
are
contending
that
this
was
not
an
avulsion
that
the
public’s
title
to
the
river
followed
the
river
as
it
enlarged
over
the
years
this
overflow
channel.
essentially,
what
you
had
here
was
a
river
flow
and
around
an
island
at
an
intermediate
stage
--
mr.
peter
herman
well,
if
avulsion
doctrine
applies,
your
honor,
that
would
have
to
be
the
concession,
yes.
our
position
on
that
is
several
points.
first,
is
a
matter
of
law
there
was
no
avulsion
here.
there
was
no
sudden
change
of
channel,
you
had
an
existence
two
channels.
mr.
peter
herman
if
avulsion
--
if
this
court
is
to
continue
holding
an
avulsion
doctrine
applies
then
that
ends
the
case.
we
submit
that
--
mr.
peter
herman
your
honor
--
those
are
the
track
sovereign
issues.
mr.
peter
herman
they
awarded
us
tracks
one,
five,
six,
and
four
--
mr.
peter
herman
well,
actually,
you
have
got
a
combination
here
of
old
channel
and
new
channel.
the
river
falling
in
oxbow
prior
to
1890
and
part
of
the
property
and
dispute
here
is
that
same
river.
what
happened
was
there
was
an
overflow
channel
across
the
neck
of
the
oxbow
and
that
is
the
area
of
the
river
that
is
in
issue
here
in
this
court
today,
because
we
are
saying
that
the
state
has
titled
to
the
bed
or
under
that
former
overflow
channel,
which
is
now
the
main
bed
of
the
river.
there
is
no
contention
from
us
concerning
the
parcels
that
the
--
mr.
peter
herman
no,
we
are
not
asking
to
court
to
overrule
bonelli
providing
that
the
court
applies
what
we
think
is
the
logical
rationality.
mr.
peter
herman
no,
we
would
not
come
out
the
same
way,
your
honor,
because
of
the
state
--
i
assume
if
the
state
court
applied
avulsion
doctrine
they
withhold
that
we
did
not
have
title
for
the
bed
in
this
overflow
channel,
which
is
now
the
main
channel
on
the
river.
mr.
peter
herman
that
is
correct,
but
they
held
it
on
the
basis
of
bonelli,
they
applied
--
mr.
peter
herman
come
out
the
same
way
as
federal
law,
is
that
--
mr.
peter
herman
that
is
correct.
if
a
state
law
was
applied
--
well,
i
am
going
to
have
to
recede
from
that.
i
do
not
think
there
has
been
another
case
in
the
state
of
oregon
in
which
the
principle
of
avulsion
has
been
applied
against
the
sovereign.
it
is
been
applied
in
boundary
disputes
to
claim
riparian
owners,
where
a
river
was
a
monument
or
a
boundary
between
two
riparian
owners.
it
has
not
to
my
knowledge,
has
been
applied
to
say
the
state
does
not
have
title
in
the
case
of
an
avulsion,
and
that
of
course
is
our
principle
contention
here
that
avulsion
doctrine
has
no
place
in
the
case
such
as
this?
mr.
peter
herman
well,
maybe
i
misunderstood
the
courts.
i
caught
myself,
because
if
the
court
of
course
the
oregon
court
applies
avulsion
doctrine
relying
on
bonelli,
i
assume
that
it
would
apply
the
same
doctrine
even
if
bonelli
was
not
relied
upon.
however,
we
would
in
argue
in
the
court,
if
we
remanded
back
that
avulsion
is
not
appropriately
applied
to
a
situation
like
this,
because
avulsion
is
a
boundary
concept
to
mark
the
boundaries
between
riparian
owners.
it
is
inappropriately
applied
in
a
situation
where
the
sovereign
title
is
an
issue
and
if
you
are
going
to
have
an
avulsion
doctrine,
you
are
always
going
to
have
uncertainty
as
to
ownership
of
the
riverbed.
because
you
are
always
in
the
situation
of
trying
to
evaluate
changes
of
the
river
and
there
has
been
hundreds
of
changes
of
the
willamette
river
since
1859.
and
you
might
just
as
well
say
that
public
does
not
have
a
title,
there
is
no
for
public
use
and
enjoyment
because
you
are
in
the
position
of
always
having
to
litigate,
was
this
or
was
this
not
an
avulsion.
we
like
the
bonelli
rationale,
which
says,
that
the
public
title
follows
the
river.
there
was
some
language
in
the
opinion
that
indicates
that
it
only
follows
the
river
as
to
gradual
changes.
we
think
this
‘word’
gradual
raises
the
same
problem
again.
the
court
was
relying
upon
boundary
cases,
where
the
issue
is,
where
the
land
is
between
two
states
when
the
river
changes
and
those
cases
where
there
is
a
sudden
change
you
can
observe
where
the
river
was,
and
the
former
channel
of
the
river
remains
the
boundary.
but
that
rationale
is
inappropriately
applied
to
a
case
like
this.
mr.
peter
herman
well,
i
do
not
know
whether
you
could
or
not,
your
honor,
nobody
was
there
to
see
it,
the
witness
isn’t
there.
mr.
peter
herman
yes,
well,
your
honor,
i
would
answer
your
question
this
way.
you
have
an
avulsion
if
you
are
going
to
apply
the
traditional
doctrine
whether
it
is
a
channel
change,
but
i
submit
there
is
no
channel
change
when
you
have
got
both
channels
there
and
it
is
just
a
question
of
the
water
in
one
channel
changing
from
the
major
flow
to
that
channel
to
the
major
to
the
other
channel
and
even
if
it
is
sub,
it
is
not
really
--
mr.
peter
herman
i
am
not
sure,
which
court
--
the
case
the
court,
what
do
you
mean,
referring
to.
there
are
actually
very
few
cases
that
have
dealt
with
this
issue
it
is
mostly
boundary
disputes.
the
commissioner’s
case
was
the
closest
case
that
i
know
of,
and
that
involved
a
none-navigable
stream
and
a
boundary
dispute
between
two
riparian
owners.
the
court
relied
on
that
to
come
up
with
the
result
it
did
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
make
one
comment
about
the
business
of
the
rights
of
riparian
owners
under
oregon
law.
oregon
law
grants
the
riparian
owner
no
rights
below
high
water,
unless
by
affirmative
statute
or
deed
it
has
been
the
common
law
of
our
state
that
the
riparian
owner
owns
only
the
high
water.
and
that
what
rights
he
has
is
by
grant
of
the
state,
and
that
has
been
a
sovereign
law
in
our
state.
and
going
back
at
least
for
bowlby
v.
shively
in
1892,
which
was
in
this
court
on
appeal.
our
suggestion
to
this
court
is
that,
if
federal
law
is
to
be
applied
and,
we
do
agree
with
amici
california
to
this
extent
that
the
state
should
have
title
and
the
state
court
should
have
the
right
to
decide
title
in
all
cases
of
river
changes,
and
that
the
fact
there
has
been
is
so
called
avulsion
change
does
not
deprive
the
public
of
title.
and,
the
state
can
decide
whether
the
public
is
to
have
title
on
that
case
or
the
riparian
owner.
mr.
peter
herman
you
mean
change
as
to
what
court
decide
--
is
to
decide
the
issue?
mr.
peter
herman
we
have
not
asked
for
that,
no,
because
we
got
--
what
we
considered
to
be
an
unsatisfactory
result
in
the
oregon
court
and
we
were
happy
to
petition
this
court
to
have
that
result
corrected.
it
would
help
the
state
if
the
court
agrees
with
our
contention
and
rules
that
it
has
jurisdiction.
it
would
also
help
the
state
of
this
court
rules
that
it
is
up
to
the
state
to
decide
under
these
circumstances
whether
the
riparian
or
the
state
has
a
title.
mr.
peter
herman
the
court
would
have
to
modify
bonelli,
i
presume
as
to
the
comments
of
federal
common
law,
yes.
mr.
peter
herman
assess
the
satisfaction
nationwide
with
bonelli,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
herman
well,
i
like
the
result
of
bonelli
or
we
like
the
result
of
bonelli.
if
the
court
had
stopped
at
the
point
of
saying
that
arizona
has
no
title
under
the
equal-footing
doctrine
to
this
bare
land
and
the
rest
of
the
opinions
stood
the
implication
would
be
very
clear
that
the
state
would
still
have
title
no
matter
how
the
river
change.
mr.
peter
herman
yes,
although
i
think
the
federal
common
law
is
more
than
a
dicta;
because
the
court
relive
on
that
to
say
that
arizona
did
not
have
titled
to
the
bare
land,
although
the
court
could
have
said
it
did
not
have
titled
of
the
bare
land
just
based
on
the
equal-footing
doctrine.
i
think
it
is
appropriate
here
to
sum
up
what
our
position
is.
if
the
bonelli
case
is
to
apply,
we
submit
that
it
should
apply
on
this
case
and
the
oregon
court
would
have
to
be
reversed,
because
the
rationale
of
bonelli
is
that
title
follows
the
river.
and,
the
character
of
the
change
is
immaterial,
both
is
to
the
riparian
and
is
to
the
public.
we
feel
that
same
rationale
should
apply
to
both
sides.
if
the
court
is
to
modify
bonelli,
it
seems
to
us
that
part
of
the
opinion
that
in
effect
rules
the
state
has
title
under
the
constitution
or
under
the
equal-footing
doctrine
as
to
the
river
wherever
it
lies.
that
would
require
remand
back
to
the
case
to
the
oregon
courts
to
deal
with
the
fact
that
their
decision
is
inconsistent
with
the
way
this
court
would
interpret
bonelli
under
those
circumstances
and
leave
to
the
oregon
courts
and
legislature
to
decide
how
the
title
should
be
apportioned
between
the
riparian
owner
and
the
state.
mr.
peter
herman
they
held
there
was
an
avulsion
in
this
case,
yes.
mr.
peter
herman
they
should
not
accept
it,
because
we
submit
both
as
a
matter
of
law,
whether
you
are
looking
at
traditional
avulsion
doctrine
or
looking
at
the
equal-footing
doctrine
under
bonelli,
this
was
not
an
avulsion,
and
it
was
not
an
avulsion
because
it
was
a
20-year
process
in
fact.
one-fourth
of
the
river
was
going
through
this
channel
in
1906
and
it
did
not
change
until
november
of
1909.
so
i
submit
that
this
is
a
matter
of
classic
avulsion;
that
is
not
an
avulsion.
mr.
peter
herman
well,
if
it
is
in
the
court
rules
it
is
still
up
to
the
state
to
decide,
to
--
mr.
peter
herman
well,
i
think
i
would
rather
not
predict
that,
because
i
would
want
to
argue
to
the
point
that
this
really
is
not
an
appropriate
doctrine
to
apply
when
the
state
is
the
sovereign
and
the
owner
of
the
bed
and
the
issue
is
whether
the
state
has
title
to
where
the
river
now
flows.
i
would
want
to
argue
that,
we
would
want
to
argue
that
point
again
and
get
the
court
to
reexamine
its
thinking.
particularly
since
this
is
a
first
case
that
where
the
state
was
involved
in
this
manner
that’s
come
up
in
the
state
of
oregon
that
i
am
aware
of.
mr.
peter
herman
the
state
was
answering
our
contention
or
it
interpreted
our
argument
to
mean
that
we
should
get
title
because
we
needed
it,
even
though,
it
was
avulsive
and
our
argument
of
course
was
that
we
needed
title
and
it
was
not
an
avulsion
and
that
our
argument
had
substance
to
it,
it
was
just
a
technical
contention
that
we
should
have
titled
because
it
was
nice
to
have
title.
mr.
peter
herman
i
think
that
states
purposing
mr.
justice
burger
because
the
facts
in
this
case
really
are
not
in
dispute,
it
is
the
conclusions
of
the
court
drew
from
those
facts
that
we
are
arguing
about.
mr.
peter
herman
i
submit
you
do
your
honor,
and
agreed
upon
setting
the
facts.
you
are
not
really
making
a
different
finding
of
fact,
because
what
the
oregon
courts
did
was
draw
a
legal
conclusion
that
from
these
facts
we
hold
an
avulsion
occurred.
it
really
was
more
of
a
legal
conclusion
because
the
facts
are
essentially
an
agreement.
mr.
peter
herman
well,
this
was
not
a
determination
of
state
law
--
mr.
peter
herman
if
there
is
a
federal
question
involved,
the
court
will
reexamine
the
inferences
or
conclusions
that
are
drawn
from
the
agreed
upon
facts.
mr.
peter
herman
yes.
mr.
peter
herman
actually,
it
took
about
20.
mr.
peter
herman
yes,
the
federal
question
aspect
of
it
is
critical
of
course,
if
there
is
no
federal
question
here,
if
the
states
not
ascertain
to
write
under
a
federal
law,
then
we
have
no
basis
to
ask
the
court.
mr.
peter
herman
right.
mr.
peter
herman
it
falls
for
almost
precisely
within
the
case
of
commissioner’s
--
i
think
the
united
states,
your
honor,
which
has
cited
in
the
brief.
the
classified
is
an
exception
to
the
accretion
doctrine,
because
what
the
river
did
was
to
fall
around
and
create
a
new
channel
and
how
long
that
took
we
do
not
know?
but
we
know
it
took
20
years
after
the
channel
was
discovered
before
it
became
the
main
channel
of
the
river.
mr.
peter
herman
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
sometime
after
november
25
of
1909.
