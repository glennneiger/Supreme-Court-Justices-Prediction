mr.
herman,
if
it
isn’t
an
avulsion,
do
you
concede
that
the
state
does
not
have
title
to
the
bed,
the
fischer’s
cut?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
let
us
assume
it
is.
i
want
to
be
sure
about
this.
if
it
were
an
avulsion
then,
you
are
contempt
to
have
a
situation
or
the
state
of
oregon
does
not
own
that
portion
of
the
bed
of
the
river.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
the
supreme
court
--
state
supreme
court
awarded
you
three
tracks
of
land,
2a,
2b
and
2c.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right,
what
did
they
award
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh
i
see
and
are
they
under
the
old
channel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mix,
could
you
help
me
a
little
bit
on
the
federal
question?
you
argue
that
a
uniform
role
is
desirable,
but
your
theory
in
federal
jurisdiction
as
i
understand
it
is
that
there
was
their
patents
involved
and
the
equal-footing
doctrine
matter
of
fact
the
river
is
navigable.
those
are
your
three
bases
for
federal
jurisdiction.
would
you
explain
to
me
what
is
the
relevance
of
the
fact
that
patented
land
involved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
hughes
they
are
construing
the
patent
of
the
prior
owner
i
believe,
are
they
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
are
not
arguing
any
basis
of
construction
on
it
prior
owner
of
this
fischer
cut,
are
you?
