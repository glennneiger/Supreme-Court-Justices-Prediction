unknown

how
is
the
basis
of
the
federal
court
jurisdiction
in
jones
v.
soulard
do
you
remember?
unknown
speaker
hughes
v.
washington,
that
was
--
unknown
speaker
is
that
kind
of
a
new
definition
of
navigability?
unknown
speaker
you
defined
in
here,
do
we
not
to
the
contrary,
at
least
on
a
different
--
maybe
you
would
say
a
different
kind
of
a
definition?
unknown
speaker
how
about
hughes
v.
washington?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
state
law
has
forced
in
that
one
to
hear
a
court
to
the
case
--
over
to
the
case
to
give
the
state
title
to
the
land
under
a
river,
which
has
changed
--
a
navigable
river
which
has
changed
its
course
noticeably
by
an
ablution
rather
than
accretion?
unknown
speaker
at
the
time
of
the
statehood,
the
rivers
in
a
certain
place
on
the
equal-footing
doctrine
the
state
gets
the
title
to
the
riverbed
as
it
been
is.
then
the
river
changes
course,
mark
at
least,
saya,
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
the
person
over
whose
land
the
river
now
flows
losses
title
to
the
riverbed.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
state
could
have
that
sort
of
a
rule?
unknown
speaker
without
any
reliance
on
any
equal-footing
doctrine.
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
say
deposition?
unknown
speaker
middle
of
the
stream.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
state
got
the
part
of
this
land
and
the
bed
of
a
new
river
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
precisely,
what
are
the
issues
that
state
raised
in
its
petition
for
certiorari?
i
take
it
that
you
have
got
title
to
three
of
these
parcels.
unknown
speaker
and
beyond
those
parcels
--
what
issues
here,
you
aren’t
raising
any
issues
to
those
parcels?
unknown
speaker
all
right
now
then,
what
are
the
--
unknown
speaker
oh
no,
i
take
it
that
--
i
do
not
see
any
claim
in
your
brief,
perhaps
it
is
there,
and
asking
us
to
overrule
bonelli?
unknown
speaker
let
us
just
assume
for
the
moment
that
state
law
would
apply
in
this
case,
and
oregon
law
would
apply
the
avulsion
and
accretion
law.
i
think
that
you
would
come
out
about
the
same
way
under
this
--
unknown
speaker
well,
they
held
that
you
did
not
have
title.
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
but
under
state
law,
you
would
come
out
about
the
same
way
at
least
as
of
these
three
tracks,
if
there
was
an
avulsion.
unknown
speaker
no,
as
the
court
--
as
the
result
here,
you
would
have
the
same
result
as
to
ownership
with
respect
--
unknown
speaker
this
is
why
you
surprised
me
in
your
possession
about
avulsion.
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
assess
the
satisfaction
up
here
with
bonelli?
unknown
speaker
i
wonder
why
you
do
not
want
to
hit
it
head-off?
unknown
speaker
do,
you
understand
your
state
towards
bonelli
that
there
was
an
avulsion
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
now,
do
you
think
that
if
federal
law
applies
that
we
should
not
necessarily
accept
their
finding
as
to
avulsion?
unknown
speaker
if
you
accept
the
finding
of
avulsion,
i
take
it
so
much
you
have
said
before
would
anticipate
the
same
result
under
oregon
law
as
under
federal
law,
if
this
was
an
avulsion.
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
that
we
decided
that
federal
law
governs,
the
federal
law
does
not
cover
but
state
law
does.
would
you
think
that
oregon
courts
would
come
out
with
the
same
result?
unknown
speaker
so
the
oregon
court
here
got
around
saying
that
they
did
not
think
the
state
really
needed
the
ownership
of
these
tracks
under
this
navigable
stream.
the
state’s
total
sovereign
interest
could
be
served
by
in
other
ways.
unknown
speaker
and
the
oregon
courts
decided
likewise
in
this
case,
with
respect
to
the
avulsive
channel.
