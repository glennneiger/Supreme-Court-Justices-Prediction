justice
thurgood
marshall
general
kidwell,
as
i
understand
it,
you
want
two
things:
you
want
idaho
to
be
written
in
as
the
member
of
the
compact,
and
to
rewrite
the
compact
and,
i
assume,
to
compel
congress
to
approve
it.
you
want
us
to
do
that,
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
there
any
difference
in
compelling
congress
and
compelling
the
states?
that's
your
problem.
you
see,
this
court
can't
compel
the
state,
a
sovereign
state,
to
make
a
compact
with
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
we
have
to
do
that,
or
could
we
just
have
some
type
of
action
which
would
say
that
these
two
states
cannot
interfere
with
idaho’s
fish?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
is
not
what
you
asked
for.
justice
thurgood
marshall
may
i
ask
one
more
question
about
the
first
part
of
the
case,
the
compact
part?
is
there
any
assurance
that
if
oregon
and
washington
both
passed
legislation
inviting
you
in
that
you’ll
necessarily
go
in?
maybe
the
terms
are
not
acceptable
to
you.
i
take
it
there
is
a
variety
of
forms
the
compact
could
take.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
just
to
dispose
of
the
first
part
of
the
case
in
my
own
mind,
if
i
may
first,
am
i
correct
in
believing
you
are
not
merely
asking
to
be
let
in,
but
you
are
asking
to
be
let
in
on
the
terms
that
you
would
specify?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
but
you
have
to
decide
what
kind
of
say-so,
wouldn’t
you,
in
order
to
formulate
a
meaningful
decree
on
the
compact
issue?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
then
you
are
in
effect
saying
all
you
need
is
the
second
branch
of
your
argument.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
first
part
can’t
really
do
anything
all
by
itself
anyway
without
this
court
in
effect
the
writing
the
compact
for
the
three
states.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
stated
position,
however,
is
that
it
would
be
improper
for
the
court
to
make
an
equitable
apportionment
of
the
fishery
among
the
three
states
in
the
absence
of
the
tribes
or
the
united
states
as
their
trustee
or
both,
suggesting
indeed
that
there
may
be
conflicts
of
interest
between
upstream
and
downstream
indian
tribes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
disagree
with
that.
