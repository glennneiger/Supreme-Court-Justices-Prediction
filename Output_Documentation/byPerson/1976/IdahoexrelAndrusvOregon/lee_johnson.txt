mr.
lee
johnson
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
very
simply
the
state
of
oregon’s
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
complaint
or
the
motion
to
file
the
complaint
should
be
dismissed,
because
the
complaint
fails
to
state
any
claim
upon
which
legal
relief
can
be
granted
or,
in
other
words,
it
fail
to
state
a
justiceable
controversy.
mr.
lee
johnson
no,
i
do
not.
but
i
think
that
is
definitely
not
what
the
state
of
idaho
is
requesting.
mr.
lee
johnson
well,
my
point
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
is,
that
it
is
not
what
the
state
of
idaho
is
asking;
indeed,
that
is
the
last
thing
that
the
state
of
idaho
wants,
and
i
think
maybe
i
can
explain
this
by
simply
first
maybe
describing
the
regulatory
scheme
that
exists
in
oregon
and
washington
and
pointing
out
to
what
idaho
wants,
it
doesn’t
want
to
strike
down
that
regulatory
scheme;
they
just
don’t
like
the
way
we
are
doing
it.
that
regulatory
scheme
provides
--
and
both
states
have
similar
statutes
--
provides
for
a
regulatory
commission.
the
commission
sets
the
time
of
fishing,
sets
the
manner
of
fishing
and
sets
the
place
of
fishing.
the
commission
--
and
this
is
strictly
in
the
area
of
commercial
fishing
that
we
are
talking
about
today,
according
to
idaho’s
complaint.
now,
the
commission,
one,
there
is
an
established
area
for
commercial
fishing.
it
is
from
the
mouth
of
the
columbia
river
up
to
approximately
140
miles,
just
short
of
bonneville
dam,
which
is
the
first
major
dam
on
the
columbia.
the
fishing
days
or
the
season
is
open
on
the
basis
of
an
escapement
level.
that
is
the
rationale
or
the
terminology
as
it
is
used
in
this
regulatory
scheme,
and
the
escapement
level
basically
is
to
get
enough
fish
over
this
commercial
fishing
area.
and
understand
there
is
a
second
commercial
fishery
above
bonneville,
which
is
the
indian
commercial
fishery,
regulated
by
the
treaties.
there
is,
of
course,
a
game
fishery
that
goes
all
the
way
through
oregon
and
washington
and
on
into
idaho.
the
escapement
level
is
premised
to
try
to
use
the
existing
spawning
beds,
to
fully
utilize
those
existing
spawning
beds
that
exist
throughout
the
columbia
and
its
tributaries,
both
oregon,
washington
and
idaho.
there
is
a
limitation
on
those
spawning
beds
because
of
the
industrialization
that
has
occurred;
but
it
is
to
utilize
those
beds
to
preserve
the
run,
and
once
that
escapement
--
and
it
is
estimated
by
taking
the
number
of
fish
that
are
in,
and
also
they
have
to
allow
for
how
many
fish
are
going
to
be
taken
by
the
indians
and
how
many
are
going
to
be
taken
by
game
fishermen
in
all
three
states
--
and
still
get
the
proper
spawning
level.
once
that
escapement
is
accomplished,
then
we
open
that
fishing
up
for
commercial
fishing
and
the
season
is
open,
and
until
that
escapement
is
accomplished
the
season
is
closed.
what
idaho
is
contending
--
and
this
is
one
of
the
things,
one
of
their
analogies
or
one
of
their
arguments,
they
rely
on
a
case,
pennsylvanian
versus
west
virginia.
but
the
whole
problem
that
idaho
has
in
this
case
is
that
the
only
effect
of
the
state
of
oregon
and
the
state
of
washington's
regulation
has
got
to
be
positive
as
far
as
the
state
of
idaho
is
concerned,
because
every
day
that
that
fishing
is
closed
means
that
fish
do
get
to
idaho.
if
the
states
had
chosen
not
to
regulate
it
or
if
this
court
should
declare
that
statute,
for
example,
as
a
undo
interference
with
interstate
commerce,
idaho
would
be
left
terribly
out
in
the
cold,
as
well
as
would
our
states,
because
what
would
happen
would
be
the
destruction
of
the
fishery.
mr.
lee
johnson
i've
got
to
...
one
is,
as
i
recall,
that
--
mr.
lee
johnson
well,
all
right.
why
don't
we
go
to
the
equitable
apportionment
argument?
i
think
our
answer
is,
our
question
--
and
we
still
think
it's
the
main
issue
in
this
case
--
is
that
the
state
of
idaho
has
got
to
state
some
basis
for
which
they
are
going
to
get
equitable
relief.
there
has
got
to
be
some
legal
basis.
mr.
lee
johnson
i
don’t
see
how
that
gives
them
any
right
whatsoever.
what
difference
would
that
be,
because
this
is
what
idaho
is
asking
is,
if
somebody
in
idaho
raises
a
bird
and
he
releases
that
bird
out
in
the
sky
--
now,
presumably
this
bird
is
a
bird
that
does
migrate
all
over
the
world
--
does
that
mean
this
court
is
then
to
order
each
state
in
the
united
states
to
adopt
regulations
to
protect
that
particular
bird
--
mr.
lee
johnson
--
simply
because
idaho
wants
to
protect
that
bird?
mr.
lee
johnson
well,
i
don’t
see
how
the
court
can
take
jurisdiction
unless
there
is
some
legal
interest
that
idaho
alleges
that’s
being
violated.
and
in
fact
--
mr.
lee
johnson
all
right.
the
only
cases
that
idaho
cites
to
support
this
proposition,
idaho
can
see
there
is
no
authority
for
this
whatsoever.
the
only
cases
they
cite
for
it
are
those
cases
in
which
this
court
has
exercised
jurisdiction,
adjudicating
water
rights
between
states.
what
is
that
based
upon?
that
is
based
upon
long-established,
common-law
riparian
rights
to
water.
every
one
of
those
cases
rests
on
that
common-law
premise.
mr.
lee
johnson
there
is
no
comparable
--
pardon
me.
mr.
lee
johnson
no,
i
would
disagree
there
...
mr.
lee
johnson
...
on
the
grounds
there,
there,
i
think
if
the
state’s
regulatory
scheme
--
if
the
state
did
nothing,
it’s
another
question;
but
if
the
state’s
regulatory
scheme,
basically
that
was
the
effect
of
the
state’s
regulatory
scheme,
then
i
think
idaho
has
a
contention,
would
have
a
very
legitimate
contention
that
the
state
--
mr.
lee
johnson
interstate
commerce,
undue
interference
with
the
interstate
commerce.
but
that
made
my
point.
mr.
lee
johnson
yes.
if
the
state
of
oregon
passed
a
law
that
said
that
no
fish
will
pass
through
the
state
of
oregon
into
idaho,
i
think
that
law
would
be
--
at
least
it
certainly
is
very
arguable
that’s
undue
interference
with
the
interstate
commerce.
mr.
lee
johnson
yes,
premised
on
the
constitution.
but
idaho
in
this
case
on
the
face
of
its
complaint
cannot
make
that
contention
about
the
oregon/washington
regulatory
scheme,
because
the
only
possible
effect
of
that
scheme
is
to
guarantee
that
fish
do
get
to
idaho.
mr.
lee
johnson
not
enough,
i
mean,
what
idaho
is
asking
this
court
--
this
is
their
whole
point.
idaho
is
asking
this
court
...
it's
not
asking
this
court
for
a
judicial
decree
that
our
statutory
and
regulatory
scheme
is
unconstitutional;
it
is
asking
that
you
not
give
judicial
review
to
that,
but
that
you
would
administer
it.
it’s
asking
you
to
become
the
fish
master
for
the
ladder,
for
the
farming.
mr.
lee
johnson
no.
well,
i
think
we
go
back
and
forth.
i
think
there
are
two
arguments
by
analogy
that
idaho
uses.
one
is
resting
on
a
constitutional
argument,
a
contention
of
interstate
commerce.
and
my
point
is
there
is,
there
is
no
undue
interference
with
interstate
commerce
on
the
face
of
it.
the
only
effect
the
regulatory
scheme
can
have
is
a
positive
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
it
guarantees
that
some
fish,
at
least,
get
up
the
river.
let
me
say
we
do
not
agree
that
--
mr.
lee
johnson
no,
i'm
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
mr.
lee
johnson
right.
mr.
lee
johnson
he's
saying
--
you're
just
saying
we're
not
being
good
enough
policemen.
and
i
should
also
point
out
one
thing,
because
this
is
certainly
something
that
when
you
get
to
the
question
of
irreparable
injury,
i
know
mr.
gorton
is
going
to
point
out
this.
the
regulations,
the
existing
regulations
today,
for
one
thing,
we
talk
about
steelhead.
the
states
of
oregon
and
washington
have
prohibited
commercial
fishing
of
steelhead
for
years.
two,
they
talk
about
the
salmon.
the
states
of
oregon
and
washington
for
the
last
two
years
has
(sic)
prohibited
any
fishing
on
the
upriver
stocks
of
salmons.
these
are
the
salmons
that
go
to
the
idaho
streams.
we
have
not
prohibited
on
the
fish
that
go
into
a
lot
of
the
oregon
streams,
and
the
reason
is,
it's
strictly
a
conservation
point:
the
runs
going
to
idaho
are
in
dangerous
shape
from
a
conservation
viewpoint,
and
as
a
consequence
the
states
have
had
to
regulate
them.
so
any
idea
of
irreparable
injury
here
is
ridiculous,
because
the
fact
is
is
for
the
last
two
years,
the
state
of
oregon
and
washington
have
not
permitted
any
commercial
fishing
over
those
fish.
mr.
lee
johnson
i
think
they
can,
or
the
only
question
there
is
whether
they
are
in
effect
by
their
state
action
unduly
interfering
with
interstate
commerce,
and
that
would
be
the
only
contention
we
could
be
on.
mr.
lee
johnson
well,
i
would
have
to
say
this.
i
would
make
a
very
strong
argument
but
that’s
undue
interference
with
interstate
commerce.
and
i
think
you've
got
to
get
this
distinction,
though,
that
the
regulatory
schemes
as
they
exist
in
these
two
states
--
mr.
lee
johnson
yes.
let
me
--
mr.
lee
johnson
i
am
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
law.
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
sustaining
a
justiceable
controversy
if
idaho
--
mr.
lee
johnson
on
water
rights,
i
think
there
is
a
long
common-law
--
mr.
lee
johnson
i
do
not
think
we
can
on
fish,
because
the
common
law
is
pretty
well-established.
those
fish,
the
state
does
not
have
any
proprietary
right
to
those
fish.
mr.
lee
johnson
well,
first,
i
was
answering
you
on
the
common
law.
and
secondly,
i
think
there
is
a
question
under
interstate
commerce.
but
let
me
say
if
idaho
was
interfering,
doing
the
same
thing
to
the
fish
--
mr.
lee
johnson
i
feel
that
our
remedy
is,
we
do
not
have
a
right
to
go
enjoin
the
state
of
idaho
to
regulate
its
fishery.
mr.
lee
johnson
on
water,
i
think
there
is
a
possible
contention
--
we
can
certainly
to
the
point
that
it’s
destroying
our
riparian
rights.
mr.
lee
johnson
well,
i
think
it
gets
--
and
this
court
in
those
water-right
cases,
it
has
accepted
jurisdiction
in
a
number
of
them;
in
most
of
them,
as
i
recall
reading
them,
the
court
has
backed
off
because
of
this
statutory
problem.
the
appropriate
place
for
the
state
of
oregon
to
go
to
solve
that
problem
and
my
point
here
is,
the
appropriate
place
for
idaho
is,
one,
is
to
try
to
work
out
a
compact.
and
idaho
--
i
think
this
should
be
made
clear
to
the
court
what
idaho
--
they
say,
"well,
there's
differences
of
opinion
over
the
compact."
yes,
we
want
to
regulate
the
streams
in
idaho.
idaho
doesn’t
want
to
come
into
the
compact
on
that
term.
we
said,
"we
are
going
to
regulate
the
oregon
and
washington
streams.
how
about
let's
also
regulating
the
tributaries
to
the
columbia
that
are
in
idaho?"
that’s
where
the
argument
is.
that’s
why
we
haven’t
been
able
to
get
finally
together.
i
am
confident
the
three
states
are
going
to.
but
secondly,
where
their
real
remedy
is
is
in
congress.
mr.
lee
johnson
thank
you.
