mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
chief
justice,
you
asked
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
absence
of
an
intent
to
get
into
the
compact,
this
court
would
have
jurisdiction.
my
answer
to
that
question
is
that
it
clearly
--
it
clearly
would.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
you
should
exercise
that
jurisdiction,
given
the
burden
and
standards
of
proof
for
you
to
take
an
original-jurisdiction
case
or
whether
or
not
there
are
not
other
forms
of
governmental
entities,
which
are
better
able
to
handle
the
question.
mr.
justice
marshall
was
entirely
correct
in
saying
that
the
united
states
is
clearly
an
indispensable
party
in
this
case,
not
only
from
the
point
of
view
of
its
protection
of
the
indians
and
not
only
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
requirement
that
congress
ratify
any
compact;
but
because
there
are
eight
dams
on
the
columbia
river
between
its
mouth,
along
the
columbia
and
the
snake
before
one
reaches
the
state
of
idaho,
every
one
of
which--
mr.
slade
gorton
it
was
--
the
first
arizona
versus
california
case
was
dismissed,
because
the
united
states
was
not
joined
as
a
defendant.
mr.
slade
gorton
in
the
second
one,
it
was
a
party.
mr.
slade
gorton
from
the
point
of
view
of
his
asking
to
be
in
the
compact,
it
seems
to
me
he
clearly
has
to
be.
i
think
from
the
point
of
view
of
his
request
for
other
relief,
he
must
do
so,
as
well,
because
those
eight
dams
on
which
--
mr.
slade
gorton
we
might
well
be,
and
we’ll
argue
what
i
am
going
to
argue
--
mr.
slade
gorton
by
the
time
that
that
happened,
idaho
would
probably
have
been
offered
membership
in
the
compact.
but
my
point
to
the
chief
justice
is
that
i
do
not
believe
that
you
should
exercise
your
jurisdiction,
which
is
discretionary,
in
any
event
in
a
case
of
this
sort.
if
you
do,
let
me
assure
you
that
you
will
be
involved
in
it
forever.
the
united
states
district
courts
in
oregon
and
washington
have
been
effectively
managing
the
fish
from
the
point
of
view
of
indian
fisheries
for
the
past
decade,
and
there
is
no
possible
end
in
sight
to
represent
to
you
that
a
simple
mathematical
division
will
reach
the
goal;
the
state
of
idaho
is
completely
erroneous.
those
eight
dams,
which
are
controlled
completely
by
the
united
states,
over
the
two
most
reasons,
the
two
upstream
dams,
we
are
presently
engaged
in
litigation
against
the
united
states,
demanding
that
they
be
redesigned
better
to
facilitate
the
passage
of
fish.
the
state
of
idaho
hasn't
even
seen
fit
to
join
that
litigation.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
that’s
…
pardon
me.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
that
is
on
the
snake.
that's
on
the
snake
up
in
idaho.
mr.
slade
gorton
exactly,
mr.
chief
justice,
exactly
as
you
did
in
new
york
versus
new
jersey
and
vermont
versus
new
york.
there
is
no
instant
urgency
in
this
case.
publications
--
not
only
the
regulations,
which
are
matters
of
public
record
of
which
you
can
take
judicial
notice;
but
publications,
in
the
production
of
which
the
state
of
idaho
has
joined
in
the
last
couple
of
months,
will
show
you
the
following
facts:
there
has
been
no
commercial
fishery
for
upriver
spring
chinook
salmon
since
1974
and
exactly
one
day
in
that
year.
there
has
been
no
commercial
fishery
for
upriver
summer
chinook
salmon
since
1964.
there
has
been
no
commercial
fishery
for
steelhead
by
washingtonians
since
the
1930s,
for
40
years.
there
has
been
no
commercial
fishery
for
steelhead
by
oregonians
since
the
people
of
oregon
passed
an
initiative
on
that
subject
in
1974.
mr.
slade
gorton
have
prohibited
commercial
fishing
for
those
fish,
which
go
to
idaho.
we
are
taking
none
of
them,
mr.
justice
brennan,
zero.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
indian
fisheries
have
gone
on
longer
than
that;
but
the
indian
fisheries,
which
of
course
are
not
controlled
by
our
states
or
by
the
compact,
were
stopped
on
a
commercial
basis
in
the
terrible
year
of
1975.
on
many
of
these,
even
the
indians
cooperated
in
this
respect
and
banned
their
commercial
fishery.
mr.
slade
gorton
well,
that
is
because
1975
was
a
terrible
year,
your
honor.
if
you
will
look
at
these
figures
--
and
i
will
get
to
why
it
was
a
terrible
year
in
just
a
moment
--
mr.
slade
gorton
you
are
entitled,
it
seems
to
me,
to
take
judicial
notice
of
matters
which
are
published,
and
particularly
of
orders
--
mr.
slade
gorton
they
are
some
of
the
facts
which
would
be
so
involved.
mr.
slade
gorton
that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
should
consider
whether
or
not
this
is
a
case
in
which
you
can
fashion
appropriate
judicial
relief.
if
you
are
dealing,
as
you
were
in
vermont
versus
new
york
with
only
one
tiny
aspect
of
a
problem,
which
also
involves
irrigations,
use
of
water
which
hurts
fish,
which
also
involves
indian
rights,
which
also
involves
dams
constructed
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
there
simply
isn't
any
way
in
which
you
can
provide
for
the
relief
which
they
ask
for,
and
there
are
alternative
sources
for
their
reaching
those
rights.
and
those
are
exactly
the
grounds
on
which
you
have
declined
to
exercise
your
original
jurisdiction
in
cases
like
vermont
versus
new
york
and
new
jersey
versus
pennsylvania.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
believe
it
is
not,
your
honor.
i
think
it
has
to
simply
agree
whether
or
not
to
intervene.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
believe
so,
and
i
believe
in
a
district
court
action,
for
example,
that
it
is
very
likely,
at
least,
that
the
fish
commissions
of
the
respective
states
could
be
sued
if
we
were
to
start
at
a
district
court
level.
there
hasn't
--
mr.
slade
gorton
the
united
states
at
the
corps
of
engineers.
we
have
no
control
of
them.
we
have
--
mr.
slade
gorton
exactly,
it
could
be.
we
are
in
lawsuits
against
the
corps
of
engineers
right
now
on
two
of
the
dams
on
the
snake,
demanding
greater
fish
escapement.
idaho
hasn't
bothered
to
join
that
litigation.
they
come
here
to
sue
the
wrong
parties
for
the
wrong
reasons
for
something
we're
not
doing.
we
haven't
even
permitted
recreational
fisheries
in
the
columbia
river
on
steelhead
since
1974,
on
upriver
chinook
since
1973,
upriver
summer
chinook
since
'73.
mr.
slade
gorton
those
are
not
under
the
compact.
there
is,
of
course,
a
very
--
mr.
slade
gorton
there
is
a
very
considerable
commercial
fishery
not
at
the
mouths
of
the
rivers,
but
on
the
open
ocean,
which
involves
alaska,
british
columbia,
washington,
oregon
and
california
fisheries.
mr.
slade
gorton
well,
until
the
2
--
under
the
new
200-mile
limit
law
to
which
general
kidwell
referred,
there
is
now
a
commission
to
work
on
that
200-mile-limit
area,
of
which
idaho
is
a
member.
it
is
the
only
member
on
any
one
of
those
commissions
in
the
entire
united
states
which
is
not
an
oceanfront
state.
but
the
reason
for
the
lost
of
these
fish
is
not
commercial
fishing,
it’s
not
recreational
fishing;
it’s
dams.
every
one
of
those
dams
destroys
15%
of
the
fish
which
try
to
get
over
it.
so
100
fish
below
bonneville
become
27
fish
at
the
border
of
idaho.
mr.
slade
gorton
if
there
were
no
commercial
fishing
on
the
ocean
side
at
all,
which
is
not
totally
under
the
jurisdiction
of
these
states,
more
fish
would
get
up
there.
now,
you
will
get
to
the
point,
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
slade
gorton
there
is,
but
that
has
not
been
a
subject
of
this
complaint.
this
complaint
is
talking
about
river
fishing
under
the
compact.
that’s
the
way
he
brought
the
complaint.
that
ocean
fishery
is
not
under
the
compact.
now,
there
is,
of
course,
also
escapement
beyond
which
you
gain
nothing.
there
is
a
maximum
form
of
escapement.
for
example,
in
one
of
these
groups
of
fish,
it’s
40,000
above
the
last
dam
in
washington.
but
idaho
has
shown
no
great
interest
in
this
area.
the
hells
canyon
dam,
which
is
a
privately
owned
dam
by
the
idaho
power
company,
cuts
off
fish
entirely
in
half
of
the
entire
original
spawning
area
of
the
snake
river,
and
that’s
cut
off
the
lower
states,
of
course,
as
well
as
what
goes
on
in
idaho
above
that
point.
idaho
has
shown
no
interest
in
joining
with
us
in
litigation
over
the
dams,
which
have
caused
their
own
losses.
they
simply
demand
to
be
put
into
a
compact,
which
your
own
questions
have
indicated
is
entirely
without
precedent,
or
to
get
you
into
a
fish-management
program
which
is
simply
impossible
for
you
to
administer
when
there
is
not
only
the
compact
itself,
but
a
pacific
northwest
regional
commission,
which
incidentally
has
said
that
the
compact
is
the
third
best
method
of
administering
these
fish;
a
new
commission
for
ocean
fisheries
under
the
200-mile
limit,
the
negotiations
of
which
are
going
on
at
the
present
time.
this
case
you
do
have
jurisdiction,
and
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
but
that
leaving
aside
the
compact
portion
of
this
case,
you
have
jurisdiction
to
take
this
case.
it’s
by
one
state
against
another.
it
falls
within
that
constitutional
prohibition.
but
if
you
take
it,
you
are
going
to
be
in
that
morass
for
years
to
come.
you
are
not
going
to
have
everyone
subject
to
your
jurisdiction.
mr.
slade
gorton
it’s
a
way
--
it’s
one
on
which
you
have
historically
declined
such.
you’ve
said
in
new
york
versus
new
jersey
that
you
were
convinced
after
looking
at
it
that
a
problem,
which
was
the
problem
of
both
of
those
states,
would
be
solved,
in
fact,
by
the
work
of
those
two
states.
in
vermont
versus
new
york,
you
--
mr.
slade
gorton
pardon?
mr.
slade
gorton
i
understand
that,
and
then
--
mr.
slade
gorton
that
was
on
puget
sound.
that
is
not
a
part
of
--
mr.
slade
gorton
no.
that
has
to
do
with
the
indian
fishery;
but
it
has
to
do
with
the
indian
fishery
on
puget
sound,
which
is
totally
unrelated
to
this
case.
no
puget
sound
salmon
ever
go
to
idaho.
simply
to
return
to
the
final
point
that
i
was
making,
in
vermont
versus
new
york,
this
court
refused
to
enter
a
consent
decree
to
which
both
states
agreed,
because
it
would
involve
the
court
in
the
continuing
supervision
over
a
matter
relating
to
waters,
not
totally
dissimilar
to
this,
unlike
your
cases
involving
the
rivers
in
the
western
part
of
the
country,
where
you
had
an
order
which
could
specifically
be
entered
as
to
how
much
water
had
to
pass
the
border
between
colorado
and
kansas,
for
example,
after
which
state
regulation
was
perfectly
appropriate.
in
this
case,
these
disputes
as
to
the
proper
number
of
fish
to
be
let
go
for
simply
replenishment
purposes,
as
to
a
proper
division
between
sportsmen
in
idaho
and
commercial
fishermen
in
oregon
and
washington
are
literally
unending.
every
single
season
is
different
from
every
single
one
of
its
predecessors.
in
fact,
the
reason
for
this
lawsuit
is
that
we
are
in
a
period
of
very
low
runs,
which
coincide
with
the
runs
which
could
not
get
over
the
newest
to
these
dams.
several
of
these
dams
have
been
completed
just
in
the
last
three
or
four
years,
and
they
have
simple
decimated
the
idaho
fish
runs
going
down
at
the
point
where
they
are
not
fished
by
anyone
at
all.
and
so
consequently
in
these
years,
they
are
not
able
to
come
back,
up
and
this
has
created
a
problem
for
the
state
of
idaho
which
it
did
not
envisage
when
it
refused
to
fight
against
the
dams
or
to
fight
for
better
escapement
over
those
dams,
and
we
end
up
being
--
mr.
slade
gorton
95%
of
the
1973
smolts
going
downstream
were
killed
by
the
dams.
mr.
slade
gorton
exactly,
and
why
we
were
unable
--
and
why
we
simply
had
to
ban
any
commercial
or
recreational
fishing
at
all
on
fish
going
to
idaho,
because
we
agree
with
them
that
too
few
fish
are
going
back
there
for
anyone
to
have
the
season
and
for
the
fish
to
reproduce
themselves.
but
we
haven’t
created
for
them
an
emergency
which
requires
you
to
deal
with
it
right
now.
the
emergency
was
created
by
the
dams;
we
are
at
least
as
interested
in
it
as
idaho
is.
we
spend
much
more
money
on
it
than
idaho
does.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
it
hurts
us
worse
than
anyone.
mr.
slade
gorton
yeah,
exactly.
the
fishery
has
been
destroyed
by
a
large
combination
of
events,
the
most
significant
of
which
is
dams,
irrigation
water,
the
possibility
of
diversions
to
california,
indian
fisheries
and
commercial
and
sports
fisheries.
you
are
asked
to
take
jurisdiction
over
one
tiny
aspect
of
that
problem,
which
you
simply
can’t
solve
by
taking
that
portion
of
it.
mr.
slade
gorton
they
may
well
be,
but
they
can
probably
solve
the
problems
better
themselves,
now
that
we
have
a
congress
which
is
much
more
interested
in
giving
money
for
fish
escapement
than
it
ever
was
in
the
1930s,
1940s
and
the
1950s
when
these
--
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
sir.
now,
mr.
justice
brennan,
obviously,
i
can’t
stand
here
and
promise
you
that
my
legislature
will
act
favorably
in
january.
moreover,
i
perfectly
agree
with
him
that
the
fact
that
this
lawsuit
has
certainly
helped
in
something
we've
wanted
for
a
long
time.
i
believe,
however,
that
by
march,
we
will
have
made
such
an
offer.
the
point
is,
if
they
aren't
satisfied
with
membership,
they
want
a
veto
right.
mr.
slade
gorton
we
certainly
will,
your
honor.
