justice
potter
stewart
now
the
assistant
general
has
represented
that
the
state
of
oregon
has
agreed
to
your
joining
the
compact
and
that
the
state
of
washington
was
on
its
way
to
agreeing
to
it,
one
of
its
houses
having
enacted
the
necessary
legislation
or
passed
the
necessary
resolutions,
and
then
the
term
of
the
legislature
ended,
but
that
there
is
every
possibility
that
the
state
of
washington
will
do
so
early
next
year.
do
you
agree
with
that
as
just
a
matter
of
fact?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
something
has
happened
recently.
oregon
has
acted
and
one
house
of
the
washington
legislature
has
acted,
and
itâ€™s
represented
there
is
every
prospect
that
both
bouses
of
the
washington
legislature
will
act
soon
after
it
convenes
in
january
of
...
next
january.
justice
potter
stewart
incidentally,
what
has
prompted
this
activity
finally
in
oregon
and
washington,
the
filing
of
this
complaint?
