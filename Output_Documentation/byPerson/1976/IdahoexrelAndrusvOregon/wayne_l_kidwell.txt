mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
attorney
general
gorton,
attorney
general
johnson,
gentlemen.
we
are
asking
this
court
to
grant
our
motion
for
leave
to
file
our
complaint
under
the
provision
of
the
constitution
granting
original
jurisdiction,
because
we
are
facing
what
we
consider
in
the
northwest
a
problem
of
monumental
importance,
of
nationwide
importance.
we’re
talking
about
the
anadromous
fish
runs,
the
anadromous
fish,
a
migratory
fish
that
is
born
in
freshwater,
eventually
makes
its
way
to
the
sea,
living
from
one
to
four
years
in
the
sea,
and
then,
if
possible,
returns
to
the
place
of
its
birth
to
spawn.
the
problem
is
the
900
miles
that
these
fish
may
travel
has
(sic)
many
hazards.
we
recognize
there
are
other
hazards
than
we’re
going
to
address
ourselves
hereto
today.
obviously,
we
have
dams;
there
are
eight
of
them
over
the
part
of
the
columbia
river
basin
that
we’re
talking
about
today.
they
certainly
take
their
toll.
the
nitrogen
super-saturation,
the
slack
water,
the
pollution.
there
are
some
factors:
heavy
sports
fishing
and
commercial
fishing.
the
problem
is
that
the
anadromous
fish,
after
they
leave
the
ocean,
go
through
two
states;
but
over
half
of
them
spawn
in
the
state
of
idaho.
and
the
anadromous
fish
are
governed
by
a
compact
that
was
passed
by
the
states
of
oregon
and
washington
in
1915,
ratified
by
the
united
states
congress
in
1918,
of
which
only
the
two
states
are
members.
idaho
has
not
had
a
voice.
it’s
not
because
the
state
of
idaho
has
not
attempted
to
have
a
voice.
as
far
back
as
1937,
the
united
states
fisheries
commission
recommended
then
that
idaho
be
made
a
member
of
the
columbia
river
fish
compact.
negotiations
were
started.
they
continued
for
many,
many
years.
as
recently
as
1968,
the
governors
of
the
three
states
convened
a
meeting
to
discuss
the
anadromous
fish
in
the
pacific
northwest,
and
the
governors
of
these
three
states
did
recommend
that
idaho
become
a
member;
however,
nearly
40
years
now
have
elapsed
since
the
compact
was
first
entered
into,
and
idaho
is
still
not
a
member.
the
problem
is,
if
idaho
were
a
member,
we
feel
that
the
problem
would
not
be
as
acute
and
critical
as
it
is.
if
we
are
allowed
to
file
our
complaint,
we
can
show
by
competent
evidence
that
in
many
instances,
the
fish
runs
themselves
have
been
depleted
by
as
much
as
80%.
this
anadromous
fish
cycle
is
a
unique
...
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
your
honor,
i
guess
i
would
have
to
blame
politics.
many
of
the
leaders
of
the
states
have
expressed
their
desire
and
willingness
to
have
idaho
made
a
member,
but
the
state
legislatures
have
never
gotten
around
to
admitting
the
state
of
idaho.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
no,
sir,
it
is
not.
if
we
are
admitted
to
the
columbia
river
fish
compact,
that’s
only
step
1.
there
would
be
three
states
then,
if
we
were
given
an
equal
voice,
the
problem
would
arise
that
idaho
would
have
interests
that
are
somewhat
different
than
oregon
and
washington,
and
there
is
certainly
the
danger
of
our
being
outvoted
two
to
one
and
we
would
maintain
the
status
quo,
and
nothing
would
change.
so
we
are
asking
this
court
to
grant
us
admission
to
the
columbia
river
fish
compact.
now,
i
recognize
--
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
justice
rehnquist,
i
was
going
to
point
out
that
i
recognize
that
there
has
been
no
case,
at
least
that
we
have
been
able
to
find,
whereby
this
court
could
say
directly
that
we
would
be
entitled
to
become
a
member;
however,
there
is
considerable
authority,
your
honor,
that
this
court
is
the
final
say-so
on
the
politity
and
operation
and
fairness
of
interstate
compacts.
so
we
would
urge
either
that
this
court
take
the
unprecedented
step
of
saying
that
idaho
should
be
a
member,
or
achieve
the
same
result
by
saying
that
those
portions
of
the
compact
that
deny
idaho
its
fair
share,
its
apportionment,
of
the
anadromous
fish
be
declared
invalid
so
far
as
the
operation
of
the
compact
is
concerned.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
your
honor,
probably
the
most
clear
expression
by
this
court
would
be
a
fairly
recent
case,
nebraska
versus
iowa
at
406
u.s,
your
honor,
where
the
court
then
was
not
reviewing
a
fish
compact,
but
it
was
a
compact
between
two
states
concerning
itself
with
the
river
boundaries
between
the
two
states.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
yes,
your
honor,
it
had
been.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
that’s
essentially
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
yes,
your
honor.
the
problem
is
that
the
fish,
when
they
are
attempting
to
return
to
idaho
to
spawn,
are
taken
from
the
columbia
river
through
many
other
factors;
but
commercial
fishing
is
one
way
that
we
feel
if
idaho
were
in
that
we
could
attempt
to
cut
back.
what
we
are
asking
for
is,
one,
to
become
a
member
of
the
compact
and,
secondly,
for
this
court
to
apply,
for
want
of
a
better
word,
i’ll
call
it
equitable
apportionment,
recognizing
that
this
court
has
applied
that
in
water
cases
and
applying
it
to
this
--
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
justice
brennan,
the
reason
i
cited
nebraska
versus
iowa
is
only
to
point
out
that
this
court
has
said
that
they
are
the
final
arbiter,
that
you
are
the
final
arbiter.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
as
to
the
meaning
of
a
compact;
and
if
this
compact,
if
it
were
determined
by
the
proof
that
the
compact
itself
was
depriving
idaho
of
substantive
rights
in
this
natural
resource,
then
the
court
could
declare
it
invalid
insofar
as
it
takes
these
rights
from
the
state
of
idaho.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
no,
your
honor,
the
compact
does
not
bar
us,
and
at
this
point
we
felt
that
the
most
appropriate
remedy
and
after
much
discussion
would
be
to
come
to
this
court
with
this
type
of
original-jurisdiction
case.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
your
honor,
there
is
always
that
hazard.
we
do
feel,
however,
that
last
year
h.r.
200,
which
was
passed
by
the
congress,
which
regulated
the
fishing
three
miles
out,
out
to
200
miles
out,
specifically
recognized
the
state
of
idaho
as
having
a
voice
in
a
congressional
discussion
then
concerning
the
anadromous
fish,
indicated
that
if
there
were
the
question
of
ratification
up
now
of
the
original
compact
that
it
is
very
likely
they
would
not
approve
it
without
idaho
being
made
a
member
because
of
the
danger
of
extinction
of
these
fish,
of
the
anadromous
fish
themselves.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
justice
stewart,
if,
in
fact,
the
problem
would
become
moot
sometime
in
the
future,
idaho
would
be
first
in
line
to
ask
to
dismiss
this
case.
we
have
been
looking
at
it
for
40
years.
the
state
of
oregon,
finally
through
their
legislature,
did
pass
a
version
of
a
compact
after
we
had
filed
this
motion
for
leave
to
file
our
complaint.
even
with
this
pending,
the
state
of
washington
was
not
able
to
pass
both
houses
the
compact
itself.
so
if
both
states
would
admit
idaho
as
a
voting
member
of
the
compact
and
if
there
were
some
way
that
the
compact
would
give
idaho
a
say-so
in
the
anadromous
runs
or
in
the
fish
that
are
produced
in
our
state,
then
the
problem
could
become
moot.
but
the
argument
now
has
been
going
on
in
this
vein,
your
honor,
for
about
40
years,
and
nothing
has
happened.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
your
honor,
there
is
an
additional
problem,
however.
the
compact
as
passed
by
the
state
of
oregon
is
not
in
the
same
form
as
proposed
by
the
state
of
washington
and
would
purport
to
regulate
all
fishing,
even
on
the
headwaters
and
streams
in
the
state
of
idaho.
my
point
being
is
that
even
now,
there
is
no
agreement
between
the
two
states
as
to
what
form
a
new
compact
should
take.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be
unfair
to
completely
characterize
it
as
that;
but
from
my
standpoint,
there
was
no
compact
passed
by
the
legislature
until
after
we
had
filed
this
motion
and
after
about
40
years
of
discussion.
it’s
almost
ten
years
since
the
governors
of
the
three
states
themselves
agreed
that
idaho
should
be
made
a
member
of
this
before
anything
has
happened.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
justice
marshall,
obviously,
i
recognize
that
we
cannot
compel
congress
to
approve
it.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
your
honor,
that's
--
justice
marshall,
that’s
why
i
pointed
out
that
i
believe
that
this
court
could
achieve
that
by
invalidating
that
portion
of
the
columbia
river
compact
that
would
deny
idaho
its
say-so.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
your
honor,
that
in
effect
would
do
it.
that’s
the
second
part,the
--
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
your
honor,
we
are
asking
for
two
things:
one,
to
be
made
a
member
of
the
compact;
recognizing
the
difficulties
there,
the
second
part
is
what
i
have
entitled
equitable
apportionment
or,
in
other
words,
giving
us
a
right
to
our
fair
share
of
the
fish
commensurate
with
the
amount
of
the
fish
produced
in
the
state
of
idaho.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
certainly
is
a
problem.
we
recognize
that
that’s
why
the
second
part
of
our
prayer
for
relief
is
essential,
or
the
basic
fairness
or
equitable
apportionment,
as
we
have
called
it.
if
idaho
were
to
be
guaranteed
a
right
to
its
share
of
the
anadromous
fish,
that
they
would
not
interfere
with
the
share
of
the
fish,
this
in
effect
would,
we
feel,
force
the
three
states
to
sit
down
and
agree.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
putting
at
a
little
harsher
than
we
would
like
to
have
it
recognized.
we
are
asking
to
have
a
say-so
in
the
anadromous
fish
runs,
over
50%
of
which
originate
in
the
state
of
idaho.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
your
honor,
we
feel
that
if
there
was
an
order
entered
that
idaho
was
entitled
to
its
share
of
the
fish,
that
this
would
then
enforce
the
states
to
agree.
i
recognize
--
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
your
honor,
i
am
saying
if
the
second
part
of
our
argument
were
granted,
if
that
relief
were
granted,
it
would
take
care
of
the
first.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
your
honor,
we
feel
that
even
if
we
had
a
voice
or
a
say-so
in
the
compact,
the
first
part,
which
would
not
give
us
our
total
relief,
even
having
the
say-so
as
one-third
of
the
compact
would
be
more
than
we
have
had
for
the
last
40
years.
the
second
part
is
the
essential
part
to
what
we
are
asking
this
court.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
your
honor,
it
is
--
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
your
honor,
it
is
capable
of
determining
the
amount
of
fish
that
are
going
into
the
headwaters
with
almost
mathematical
precision.
our
fish
and
game
department
is
prepared
to
show,
as
i
say,
with
mathematical
precision
the
amount
of
fish
that
should
be
allowed
to
escape
the
figures
they
use
into
the
state
of
idaho.
over
each
of
these
dams,
there
is
a
counting
process.
one
of
these
dams
on
the
colombia
river
is
...
the
last
dam
before
the
fish
go
into
idaho
is
ice
harbor
dam,
and
the
count
going
over
there
at
this
point
is
so
low
that
it
can
be
determined
with
precision
how
much
or
what
efforts
should
be
made
down
below
to
allow
more
escapement.
there
are
a
couple
of
other
factors
that
i
wanted
--
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
we
do
feel
some
efforts
could
be
made
--
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
yes,
your
honor.
we
do
feel
that
if
idaho
had
a
say-so
in
the
compact,
that
additional
efforts
could
be
made
in
putting
what
they
call
the
certain
types
of
lifts
on
the
dams
to
stop
the
super-saturation,
the
turbine
damage
and
some
of
these
things.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
additional
ladders,
yeah,
improved
ladders
that
will
take
care
of
the
other
varieties
of
--
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
salmon
and
steelhead,
your
honor,
yes;
primarily,
the
spring
chinook
salmon
and
the
steelhead.
as
i
pointed
out,
this
is
a
truly
unique
phenomena
in
nature,
these
fish
returning
to
where
they
spawn.
a
couple
of
other
points
--
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
your
honor,
the
chinook
salmon
automatically
does
die.
it
comes
to
the
end
of
its
lifecycle
after
they
spawn.
the
steelhead
theoretically
can
go
back
to
the
ocean.
the
figures
and
statistics
of
how
many
make
it
back
are
rather
slight,
but
they
do
not
automatically
die;
they
attempt
to.
a
couple
of
other
points
that
i
was
going
to
bring
out,
idaho,
along
with
the
other
states,
has
attempted
to
minimize
the
impact
of
the
loss
of
our
anadromous
fish
by
artificial
spawning,
planting
of
these
fish.
i
would
point
out
one
problem
that
we
have
continually
run
into
is
that
idaho,
being
a
very
small
state,
we
spend
well
over
a
million
dollars
a
year
in
these
efforts;
but
all
of
the
fish
that
we
transplant
or
artificially
spawn
in
the
state
of
idaho,
then
to
go
to
the
ocean
and
come
back,
of
course,
a
portion
of
them
are
taken
by
the
states
of
oregon
and
washington.
oregon
and
washington
also
spend
considerable
sums
of
money;
but
we
do
not
have
the
same
benefit
from
the
money
they
spend,
because
the
fish
return
to
where
they're
put
into
the
water
and
do
not
pass
through
the
state
of
idaho.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
no,
there
is
no
significant
problem
when
they
are
on
their
way
back
other
than
the
dams
and
the
other
…
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
when
they
are
going
back
to
the
ocean.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
okay,
either
one,
either
the
steelhead
going
back
or
the
smolts
going
down,
juveniles,
no,
your
honor,
there
is
no
problem
of
fishing.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
there
is
a
tremendous
problem
with
turbine
damage
and
the
ladders
and
this
type
of
things,
but
no
problem
with
the
fishing.
it’s
only
when
they
are
on
their
way
up
--
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
--
up
to
spawn.
the
equitable
apportionment
argument,
i
feel
...
although
i
can’t
cite
this
court
any
actual
case
right
in
point,
i
feel
that
the
water
cases
are
analogous,
the
pollution
cases.
certainly,
this
court
has
demonstrated
many
times
that
it
under
the
right
factual
situation
can
stop
pollution
above
a
state.
if
we
can
stop
a
state
from
putting
something
into
the
water
before
the
water
gets
there,
certainly
it
would
seem
obvious
that
the
court
would
have
the
same
jurisdiction
to
stop
them
from
taking
something
out
of
the
water
that
was
unique
and
a
part
of
the
natural
ecological
cycle.
i
think
it’s
also
important
to
mention
the
reason
we
need
this
court
to
invoke
its
original
and
exclusive
jurisdiction,
this
is
the
only
forum
that
we
have.
as
the
court
is
well
aware
under
title
28
of
the
united
states
code,
section
1251(a)(1)
on
this
type
of
dispute
between
the
two
states
--
and
i
would
emphasize
there
is
no
reason
for
the
united
states
to
be
a
party
to
this.
there
is
no
problem
with
the
indian
rights.
we
recognize
that
they
have
certain
treaty-guaranteed
rights.
it
has
been
adjudicated
rather
fully.
this
would
not
diminish
or
interfere
with
the
treaty
rights
or
the
rights
that
the
indians
have
been
granted
under
existing
case
law.
we
have
no
other
place
to
go.
we
have
attempted
diplomacy,
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
controversies
of
this
time.
as
the
court
has
said
many
times,
there
are
three
ways
to
settle
disputes
of
this
nature:
diplomacy,
war
or
by
coming
to
this
court.
obviously,
we
feel
very
friendly
toward
oregon
and
washington
and
we
don’t
advocate
going
to
war
with
them;
so
we
are
asking
this
court
to
invoke
its
original
jurisdiction,
let
us
put
on
clear
and
convincing
evidence
as
to
what's
happening
to
the
anadromous
fish
runs
in
the
northwest.
if
i
might
briefly
refer
to
the
briefs
filed
by
the
state
of
washington
and
the
state
of
oregon.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
your
honor,
i
don’t
believe
that
it
would.
we
recognize
the
treaty
rights
and
that
there
are
some
federal
rights.
we
also
recognize
that
this
interstate
stream
could
be
federalized;
but
since
that
has
not
happened,
it
is
a
dispute
only
between
the
two
states,
primarily
--
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
am
aware
that
the
...
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
we
disagree
with
that.
the
solicitor
general
brief
--
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
your
honor,
i
think
they
have
a
tremendous
interest.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
under
--
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
your
honor,
i
said
that
if
idaho
--
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
yes,
your
honor,
i
said
that
if
idaho
were
admitted
as
a
member
of
the
compact,
we
feel
that
we
could
have
some
say-so.
i
suppose
there
is
a
lobbying
group,
if
nothing
else,
to
the
congress
urging
them
to
make
additional
fish
ladders
and
…
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
your
honor,
if
that
did
--
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
yes,
your
honor,
if
that
did
happen.
but
under
the
relief
we
have
asked,
we
respectfully
urge
that
there
is
no
reason
for
the
united
states
to
have
an
interest
in
the
compact.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
your
honor,
other
than
through
the
congress;
the
congress,
i
believe,
could
make
additional
appropriations
for
moneys
for
fish
ladders
or
the
various
remedies
that
are
available
through
the
dam.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
your
honor,
certainly
you
can.
i
am
just
saying
that
we
don’t
feel
that
they
are
an
essential
party
to
the
action.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
i
well
recognize
that,
your
honor,
and
i
--
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
no,
sir.
they
have
asked
to
come
into
the
case,
and
we
don’t
strenuously
say
they
should
not
be
here.
we
just
didn’t
feel
that
they
are
necessary
to
resolve
this
dispute.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
your
honor,
we
could.
we
just
didn’t
feel
that
there
was
any
interest
paramount
of
the
united
states
that
would
call
for
that.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
yes,
your
honor,
although
--
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
your
honor,
the
compact
would
rear
its
head
in
that
and
would
be
headlong
in
conflict
with
our
asking
for
this
remedy.
therefore,
it
was
my
decision
early,
maybe
erroneously,
to
ask
that
this
court
give
us
a
say-so
in
the
compact
because
of
the
40-year
history
that
we
have
attempting
...
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
justice
white,
i
do
not
feel
it
can,
and
that
is
the
equitable
apportionment.
mr.
wayne
l.
kidwell
your
honor,
we
do
not
per
se
have
to
have
the
remedy
of
the
compact.
since
the
compact
has
existed,
since
the
turn
of
a
century,
since
the
early
days
of
statehood,
we
did
feel
that
if
the
court
would
grant
that
order,
it
would
minimize
the
difficulty
of
relations
with
the
other
states;
but
the
significant
remedy
is
the
equitable-apportionment
part
of
our
complaint.
