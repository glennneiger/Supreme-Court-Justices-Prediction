justice
byron
r.
white
with
you,
i
don’t
understand
why
you
would
think
that
if
idaho
has
the
right
to
claim
that
an
agreement
between
two
other
states
completely
eliminate
it.
i
don’t
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
do
you
need
any
remedy
against
the
compact,
i
mean,
as
such?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
administers
those
dams?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
terms
of
the
suit
against
the
united
states,
i
take
it
to
the
extent
those
dams
are
significant
in
this
litigation,
the
corps
of
engineers
or
the
generals
could
be
made
parties.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
your
territorial
waters,
the
ocean
on
the
ocean
side?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
whether
they're
under
the
compact
or
not,
what
about
your
commercial
fishing
at
the
mouth
of
the
rivers?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
foreign
nations?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don’t
think
more
fish
would
come
upstream
if
there
was
no
commercial
fishing
on
the
ocean
side
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
some
commercial
fishing
in
the
ocean
that
is
subject
to
your
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
general
gorton,
is
that
really
a
basis
on
which
we
can
decline
an
original-jurisdiction
case,
that
it’s
going
to
get
us
into
a
morass?
justice
byron
r.
white
we've
had
some
of
these
cases
for
a
long
time,
general
gorton.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
say,
we've
had
some
of
these
original
cases
here
for
a
long
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
this.
have
you
had
some
unpleasantness
on
the
river
recently,
some
shootings
and
…
justice
byron
r.
white
puget
sound,
not
on
the
river.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
there's
litigation
over
the
operation
of
the
dams
that
oregon
and
washington
has
presently
pending
against
the
corps
of
engineers?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
of
course,
you
don’t
have
,
i
gather,
any
suit
pending
on
the
hells
canyon
dam,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
private.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
might
well
because,
of
course,
while
those
fish
came
down
and
benefited
our
citizens
when
that
dam
was
built
or,
actually,
its
predecessor
really
first
cut
the
...
cut
off
all
of
idaho.
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you,
general
gorton.
counsel
will
keep
the
court
notified
of
any
legislative
events.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
true
that
no
salmon
or
steelhead
can
pass
either
way
on
the
hells
canyon
dam?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
where
is
the
hells
canyon
dam?
i
know
it's
in
hells
canyon,
but
where
is
it
in
relation
to
where
the
snake
and
salmon
river
join?
justice
byron
r.
white
"the
state
made
a
mistake"?
well,
how
about
the
federal
power
commission?
was
it
in
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
on
a
tributary
of
the
snake
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
where?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
washington.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
idaho,
so
that
no
fish
can
come
upstream
from
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
up
this
branch.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
that’s
just
a
signal.
you
have
a
moment
or
two
left.
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
