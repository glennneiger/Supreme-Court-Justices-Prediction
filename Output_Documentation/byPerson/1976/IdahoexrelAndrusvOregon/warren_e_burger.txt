mr.
attorney
general,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
67
original,
idaho
against
oregon
and
washington
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
along
with
78-990,
united
states
against
bailey
and
united
states
against
cogdell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
state
of
idaho
original
case,
the
state
of
idaho
has
invoked
this
court's
original
jurisdiction
in
a
suit
against
the
states
of
oregon
and
washington.
idaho
seeks
equitable
apportionment
of
various
runs
of
anadromous
fish
migrating
from
the
pacific
ocean
to
idaho
by
way
of
the
columbia
and
snake
river.
according
to
idaho
fishermen
in
oregon
and
washington
which
are
located
downstream
from
idaho
are
taking
more
than
their
fair
share
of
fish
that
would
otherwise
return
to
idaho
to
spawn.
we
referred
the
case
to
a
special
master
who
has
recommended
that
idaho’s
complaint
be
dismissed
because
the
united
states
government
was
not
a
party
to
the
suit.
the
special
master
believes
that
the
united
states
was
a
necessary
party
because
it
regulated
fishing
in
the
pacific
ocean.
because
it
controlled
the
dams
over
which
the
migrating
fish
must
pass
on
their
way
to
idaho
and
because
it
acts
as
trustee
for
various
tribes
of
indians
who
also
are
entitled
to
a
portion
of
the
fish.
contrary
to
the
special
master’s
recommendation,
we
hold
that
this
suit
can
proceed
even
if
the
united
states
is
not
a
party.
neither
the
government’s
regulation
of
the
ocean
fishery
not
its
control
of
the
dams
would
prevent
this
court
from
allocating
to
idaho
a
portion
of
those
fish
now
being
taken
by
non-indian
fishermen
in
oregon
and
washington.
nor
would
the
indian’s
right
to
take
fish
necessarily
affect
or
be
affected
by
the
narrowly
drawn
decrees
sought
by
idaho.
we
therefore
sustain
idaho’s
exceptions
to
the
special
master’s
report
and
remand
the
case
to
him
for
further
proceedings.

justice
stewart
