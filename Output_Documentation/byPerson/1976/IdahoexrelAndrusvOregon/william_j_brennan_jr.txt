justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you're
asserting
right
now
no
more
right
than
you
would
assert
if
there
had
been
no
compact
at
all,
namely,
if
you
suggest
that
this
court
apportion
the
anadromous
fish
in
the
river
among
the
states
just
as
though
we
were
operating
on
a
stream.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
if
you're
right,
if
you’re
entitled
to
a
portion
of
those
fish
runs,
if
idaho
is,
then
the
agreement
between
two
other
states
isn’t
about
to
deprive
you
of
it.
that's
your
position,
i
take
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
your
second
argument
is
independently
of
the
compact.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
i
still
don’t
understand
your
first
one.
nebraska
and
iowa,
after
all,
held
only
that
a
compact
could
be
construed
by
this
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
all,
and
that’s
not
the
issue
on
the
--
you
want
to
have
idaho
made
a
party
member
to
the
compact,
isn’t
that
it?
but
how
can
under
the
...
that
requires,
i
thought,
the
voluntary
consents
of
the
states
and
the
approval
by
the
congress.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
to
the
meaning
of
a
compact.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
know,
as
a
remedy,
you
don’t
need
anything
more
than
the
declaration
of
--
if
you
have
it,
the
declaration
of
your
right
to
these
fish
runs
and
enjoining
anybody
else
who
interferes
with
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
notice
that
the
solicitor
general,
in
the
memorandum
that
he
has
submitted
as
amicus,
states
that
the
united
states
is
an
indispensable
party
to
this
litigation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
won't
this
require
changing
dams
on
navigable
rivers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
you
said
you
had
to
do
something
with
the
flow
of
the
dam
and
the
ladder.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
didn’t
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
that
interferes
against
the
interests
of
the
united
states
in
a
navigable
river.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
united
states
has
an
interest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don’t
know;
but
can
you
change
a
dam
without
the
permission
of
the
united
states?
i
don’t
believe
you
can
change
a
dam
on
a
navigable
river
without
their
permission
from
the
corps
of
engineers.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
congress
called
on
the
united
states
to
give
them
their
views,
of
course
they
would.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
can’t
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
do
you
resist
making
united
states
a
party?
you
say
the
indians
tribes
have
independent
rights,
fishing
rights,
in
these
rivers
...
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
...
that
is
under
the
cases
of
this
court,
the
states
are
wholly
...
they
couldn’t
possibly
totally
deny
it.
they
might
be
able
to
regulate,
but
they
couldn’t
deny
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
do
you
resist
united
states
being
a
party?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
has
been
because
washington
and
oregon
have
prohibited
commercial
fishing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
the
indians?
how
about
indian
fisheries?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
of
one
year
ago.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
sit
down,
i
understand
from
the
assistant
general’s
memorandum
that
you
contemplate
that
your
legislature
is
going
to
adopt
the
necessary
enabling
legislation
to
bring
idaho
into
the
compact?
