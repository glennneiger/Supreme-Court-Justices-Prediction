unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
then
i
would
suggest
you
get
to
the
second
part,
and
let's
hope
we
don’t
question
you
further
on
the
first.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kidwell,
may
i
ask
this
question
before
you
move
on?
if,
for
example,
we
agreed
with
your
basic
proposition
that
idaho
is
entitled
to
an
equitable
share,
how
would
you
determine
that
share
and,
if
you
determined
it
in
some
mathematical
way,
how
would
you
get
the
fish
to
idaho...
unknown
speaker
...
in
the
face
of
the
eight
dams?
unknown
speaker
by
limitation
of
both
sport
fishing
and
commercial
fishing
...
unknown
speaker
...
primarily.
the
other
problems
you
mentioned
at
the
beginning
of
your
argument
cannot
be
really
overcome.
i
mean,
the
existence
of
the
dams
and
…
unknown
speaker
...
i
guess
there's
some
pollution
and
so
on
and
nitrogen
in
the
water.
unknown
speaker
additional
ladders,
maybe,
or
…
unknown
speaker
are
we
talking
about
various
varieties
of
salmon
and
also
steelhead?
unknown
speaker
do
those
fish
generally
die
upstream
after
they
spawn?
unlike
the
atlantic
salmon,
they
go
back
out?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
fishing
of
them,
legal
fishing
of
them,
when
they're
on
their
way
out
to
the
ocean
or
only
when
they're
coming
upstream?
unknown
speaker
which
way?
what
you
are
talking
about,
"back",
which
is
what?
unknown
speaker
uh-huh.
well,
how
about
they
have
never
been
to
the
ocean,
but
they
have
been
born
in
freshwater,
the
little
ones,
and
they're
smolts.
unknown
speaker
of
fishing
on
their
way
down.
unknown
speaker
going
upstream.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
mr.
kidwell,
i
think
you
said
the
united
states
had
no
interest?
unknown
speaker
justice
brennan,
what
i
was
saying
is
that
we
respectfully
disagree
with
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general,
in
that
there
is
no
reason
or
no
legal
reason
why
the
united
states
would
have
any
interest
or
want
to
be
involved
in
this
lawsuit
between
these
two
states.
unknown
speaker
does
it
interfere
with
your
rights,
your
claims,
if
they
were
parties
in
some
way?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
has
any
interest
in
dams
on
navigable
rivers?
unknown
speaker
are
you
free
to
join
the
united
states?
you
aren’t,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
why
can’t
you
move
to
join
them
as
a
party
defendant?
unknown
speaker
i
put
a
question
to
you
first,
general
kidwell.
was
there
any
barrier
to
your
bringing
a
traditional
original-jurisdiction
case
making
a
claim
that
you
would
with
reference
to
pollution
of
the
stream
or
whatever,
which
is
really
what
you
have
embrace
within
paragraph
no.
2
of
your
prayer
for
relief,
i
would
take
it;
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
that
ignores
...
if
you
had
asked
for
that
relief
alone,
would
the
existence
of
the
compact
be
a
barrier
to
the
court’s
granting
that
relief
alone?
unknown
speaker
very
well.
general
johnson?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
state
of
idaho
had
come
in
to
pursue
the
question
i
just
put
to
your
friend
and
asked
for
nothing
expect
essentially
what
they
pray
for
in
paragraph
2.
do
you
think
the
compact
bars
this
court’s
jurisdiction
to
grant
relief
in
that
limited
area?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
it
true
that
sometimes
when
people
ask
for
five
or
seven
paragraphs
of
relief,
a
court
grants
one
or
two?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
sure
i
follow
that,
mr.
attorney
general.
i
go
back
to
my
prior
question:
what
is
the
relief
asked
for
in
this
original-jurisdiction
complaint,
which
is
just
paragraphs
1
and
2,
what
would
be
your
position
here
now?
unknown
speaker
one
is
that
we
take
jurisdiction,
the
formal
prayer,
and
the
second
is
that
we
declare
--
that
we
determine
the
equitable
apportion
of
the
upriver
fishing
that
is
due
to
idaho.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
state
that
or
at
least
they
represent
that
they
spawn
the
fish
originally.
unknown
speaker
you
are
now
going
--
unknown
speaker
you
are
now
going
to
the
remedy.
perhaps
it
would
be
correct
that
the
court
would
find
what
you
suggest;
but
would
the
court
have
jurisdiction
if
that
was
the
only
relief
sought?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
just
it.
that’s
one
of
the
questions
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
--
unknown
speaker
suppose
that
the
lower
states
simply
established
a
barrier
in
the
river
and
let
no
fish
through
whatsoever
in
idaho,
that
they're
just
going
to
take
them
all.
they
announce
one
day
that
"we
are
now
taking
all
the
fish,
not
letting
any
of
them
escape
into
idaho."
you
would
have
the
same
answer,
that
idaho
would
have
no
remedy,
no
right,
to
any
of
those
fish.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
right
would
they
have?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
find
that
right?
unknown
speaker
idaho
asserts
that
the
other
state
is
interfering
with
interstate
commerce
and
the
fish.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
any
event,
whatever
the
source
of
the
right,
you
would
concede
idaho
would
have
a
right?
unknown
speaker
but
not
enough
of
them.
unknown
speaker
so
you
simply
concede
that
idaho
is
entitled
to
an
equitable
portion
of
the
fish,
and
you
just
say
you
are
giving
them
an
equitable
portion.
that
seems
to
be
what
you're
saying.
unknown
speaker
well,
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
you've
conceded
if
you
blocked
them
all
off
that
this
could
not
be
done.
but
if
you
let
1
out
of
10
million
go
up,
is
this
all
right?
unknown
speaker
your
point
is,
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
attorney
general,
that
if
there
were
no
compact
between
washington
and
oregon
and
if
indeed
the
states,
either
in
cooperation
with
each
other
or
individually,
did
nothing,
then
no
fish
would
get
to
idaho.
unknown
speaker
what
he
is
saying,
he
hasn't
--
this
is
the
most
extraordinary
remedy.
he
is
saying
he
wants
the
states
of
oregon
--
he
does
not
like
the
way
we
regulate
it.
he
doesn’t
disagree
with
the
theory
of
our
regulation
because
if
you
had
none,
idaho
--
no
fish
would
get
up
to
the
same
river.
unknown
speaker
if
it
were
physically
feasible
--
and
i
have
no
idea
whether
it
is
--
could
idaho
put
nets
up
at
its
border
and
keep
all
these
fish
in
idaho
and
never
let
them
get
out
without
--
unknown
speaker
you
said
it
would
be
an
interference
if
that
happened
on
the
upstream
side.
why
wouldn’t
it
be
on
the
downstream
side?
unknown
speaker
general
johnson,
let
me
test
your
distinction.
you
say
that
the
main
point,
as
i
understand
your
argument
in
response
to
justice
stewart’s
question
is
that
to
the
extent
that
your
states
regulate,
idaho
benefits;
but
idaho
is
basically
asking
you
to
impose
additional
regulation,
they
have
no
standing
to
do
that.
isn’t
that
the
basis
of
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
different?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
that
different
than
supposing
idaho
had
no
regular
--
the
water
flows
towards
the
ocean,
i
assume.
assume
idaho
had
absolutely
no
pollution
control
whatsoever
and
let
industry
dump
anything
it
wanted
to
into
the
river.
and
could
you
then
have
standing
to
bring
an
action
against
idaho
to
compel
idaho
to
impose
some
regulation
on
what
was
dumped
into
the
river?
unknown
speaker
but
then
what's
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
but
you
conceded
they'd
have
a
right
on
fish
if
it
were
an
interference
rather
than
a
lack
of
adequate
regulation.
unknown
speaker
idaho
was
failing
to
do
anything
is
my
question.
if
they
failed
to
do
anything.
unknown
speaker
now,
i'm
talking
about
you
would
agree
it
could
if
it
were
water,
though.
unknown
speaker
but
you'd
have
a
remedy,
even
though
what
you
sought
was
an
order
compelling
them
to
impose
additional
regulation
they
didn't
now
impose.
then
i'd
think
you
then
--
unknown
speaker
you
are
now
into
your
colleague’s
time,
general.
unknown
speaker
it’s
our
opinion
that
the
case
should
be
dismissed.
general
gorton.
unknown
speaker
was
the
united
states
a
party
in
arizona
against
california?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
second?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
are
you
asking,
that
we
start
all
over
again
and
name
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
then
you'll
be
up
here
in
a
few
more
months
all
over
again.
unknown
speaker
so
what
you
gain
by
this
point
when
the
solicitor
general
certainly
could
move
to
intervene
if
he
wanted
to.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
high
mountain
sheep
dam?
isn't
that
on
the
same
river?
unknown
speaker
is
that
on
the
same
river?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting,
general
gorton,
that
this
case
be
put
on
the
backburner
and
let
these
diplomatic
processes
that
your
friend
from
idaho
talked
about
to
proceed?
unknown
speaker
but,
general
gorton,
when
you
ask
us
to
look
at
these
figures,
aren't
you
asking
us
to
look
at
the
evidence
that
would
be
before
the
trier
of
the
fact?
how
can
we
do
this
on
deciding
whether
to
file
a
complaint
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
aren't
these
the
precise
factual
issues
that
would
be
involved
in
a
trial
if
the
complaint
were
to
be
filed?
unknown
speaker
you
are,
i
think,
in
essence,
saying
they
can’t
prove
what
they
have
alleged.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gorton,
is
the
united
states
subject
to
suit
in
this
action
against
its
consent?
unknown
speaker
and
although
i
take
it
appropriate
officials
of
the
united
states
might
be
subject
to
suit
in
this
very
action.
unknown
speaker
they
get
decimated
as
their
smolts'
going
out
to
sea.
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
what
in
your
view
and
your
submission
basically
accounted
for
the
gross
deterioration
of
the
fishery
in
1975?
unknown
speaker
washington
does.
those
two
dams
are
in
the
snake
in
washington.
unknown
speaker
no,
we
do
not.
unknown
speaker
that
was
privately
built.
that
was
authorized
by
the
federal
power
commission
that
provided
for
no
escapement
--
unknown
speaker
of
course,
if
you
were
a
party
to
this
case,
then
you
could
file
a
crossclaim
again
and
enjoin
that
private
outfit.
unknown
speaker
that
dam
hurts
you
worse
than
anyone
...
unknown
speaker
...
as
far
as
the
fishing
goes.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
might
be
a
form
of
that,
maybe
interest
on
all
these
parties.
unknown
speaker
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
general
kidwell,
for
the
brief
time
i
have
left,
the
court
asked
--
mr.
justice
white
asked
earlier
--
about
our
priorities,
and
if
you
can
look
at
the
complaint
or
when
you
do,
in
the
complaint
i
would
point
out
that
after
our
recital
that
the
court
accept
and
assume
jurisdiction,
the
second
point
is
the
equitable-apportionment
part.
that
stands
supreme,
paramount,
the
fair-share
concept.
unknown
speaker
yes,
your
honor,
unfortunately
it
is
true,
and
i
dislike
that
as
much
as,
i'm
sure,
the
other
two
states.
unknown
speaker
your
honor,
it’s
on
another
tributary.
it’s
not
in
what
we're
arguing
about;
and
i
agree,
it’s
a
travesty.
i
think,
my
own
opinion
is
is
that
the
states
made
a
mistake
when
that
dam
was
built;
but,
yes,
that
--
unknown
speaker
well,
at
least
i
feel
they
did
not
take
all
of
the
factors
into
consideration.
yes,
your
honor,
i
feel
that
it
is
--
unknown
speaker
it’s
on
the
snake
river
itself,
your
honor.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
on
the
border
between
oregon
...
unknown
speaker
...
and
washington
and
idaho.
unknown
speaker
up
this
branch.
unknown
speaker
up
this
branch
of
the
river,
that’s
right,
your
honor.
your
honor,
very
briefly,
the
instant
urgency
that
counsel
refers
to
is
here.
the
reason
commercial
fishing
has
been
held
back,
the
reason
there
is
no
commercial
fishing
going
on
at
the
present
time,
is
because
of
the
30-year
history
of
the
columbia
river
compact.
we
recognize
that
the
dams
are
a
contributing
factor;
but
so
are
commercial
fishing,
the
size
of
the
nets,
the
gillnetting
that
is
being
allowed
on
the
river.
your
honor,
evidently
i
used
up
my
time
before,
so
i
will
…
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
all
right,
your
honor.
a
couple
of
points,
then,
very
briefly.
the
state
of
oregon
in
its
brief
cites
several
cases
as
to
why
this
court
should
not
consider
the
complexity
and
should
not
take
jurisdiction.
i
would
point
out
respectfully
that
these
cases,
the
whole
list
of
citation
in
the
brief
of
oregon,
referred
to
cases
where
the
court
would
have
original
and
exclusive
jurisdiction.
we
are
bringing
this
action
under
the
a1
provision
of
1251
where
the
court
has
exclusive
jurisdiction.
this
is
our
only
forum.
this
is
our
only
way
that
we
can
get
some
relief.
i
realize
this
is
not
going
to
entirely
solve
the
problem,
but
it’s
a
step
that
should
have
been
made
many
decades
ago.
for
40
years,
we
have
been
trying
negotiations,
and
they
have
not
worked.
