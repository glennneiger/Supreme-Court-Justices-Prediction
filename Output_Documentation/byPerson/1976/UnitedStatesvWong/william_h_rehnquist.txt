justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
brotsky,
in
connection
with
your
due
process
argument,
would
you
think
that
a
warning
as
to
other
privileges
other
than
the
self
incrimination
privilege
might
be
required,
say
such
as
the
attorney/client
privilege?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
your
due
process
argument
stands
on
the
separate
ground
from
the
privilege,
it
pretty
well
has
to
include
any
privilege
that
might
be
availed
of,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
are
not
just
talking
about
suppressing
false
testimony.
you
are
talking
about
washing
out
what
would
otherwise
be
a
perjury
charge,
aren’t
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
they
lied?
