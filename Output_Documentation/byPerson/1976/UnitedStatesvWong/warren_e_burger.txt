chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
74-635,
united
states
against
rose
wong.
mr.
sheehan,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
predicate
for
your
suggestion
that
the
case
could
be
decided
on
a
narrow
ground?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
page
of
the
appendix
was
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
brotsky?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
there
possibly
another
choice?
even
given
all
of
your
predicates,
namely,
to
decline
to
answer
--
to
decline
to
answer
without
attributing
any
reason
for
it,
to
decline
to
answer
as
an
alternative
to
lying
under
oath?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
district
court
elected
to
accept
her
understanding
at
that
stage
as
against
her
understanding
in
the
questions
that
appear
earlier
in
--
for
the
grand
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
scope
of
understanding
that
as
he
relied
on
her
without
an
interpreter
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
position
is
that
the
questions
and
answers
set
forth
on
pages
3
and
4
of
the
appendix
are
now
all
foreclosed
because
the
district
court
may
define
it
which
has
been
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
resume
at
1
o’clock.
mr.
brotsky,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
we
have
no
occasion
to
decide
in
that
case
whether
any
warning
was
required,
did
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
it
is
clearly
given
on
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
then
you
are
equating
this
as
a
parallel
to
the
miranda
type
of
situation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
didn’t
mean
as
to
the
setting.
i
mean,
as
to
the
concept
of
the
right
and
the
waiver
aspect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
mandujano
also
said
--
the
court
said
in
mandujano
that
the
oath
itself
is
a
warning,
isn’t
that,
didn't
the
court
not
say
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
in
the
miranda
setting,
there
is
no
oath
and
there
is
no
anticipation
one
way
or
the
other
that
the
subject
will
tell
the
truth
or
tell
falsehood,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
person
in
the
miranda
setting
could
tell
falsehoods
without
perhaps
becoming
incriminated,
certainly
not
in
a
perjury
sense,
could
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
to
be
said
at
all
mr.
brotsky
for
the
notion
that
any
citizen,
any
person
called
before
an
official
body,
even
without
understanding
as
you
argue
there
was
a
lack
of
understanding
here,
should
understand
that
they
must
tell
the
truth,
if
they
--
in
terms
of
whatever
they
tell?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
argument
would
carry
greater
weight
perhaps
if
you
were
talking
about
a
person
testifying
in
public,
in
the
trial
of
the
case.
here
the
testimony
was
in
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury
room
which
is
protected?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
when
you
say
what
the
prosecutor
wanted
to
hear,
you
mean
that
he
was
seeking
to
have
her
say
that
she
had
indeed
bribed
the
policemen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
that
would
expose
her
to
retaliations,
is
that
your
suggestion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
justice
white’s
illustration
which
we
eluded
to
in
the
mandujano
opinions,
you’re
not
suggesting
that
a
warning
is
required
if
a
person
is
called
in
out
of
the
cold
to
come
in
to
the
court
room
and
testify?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
civil
case,
criminal
case,
whatever?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
they
not
confronted
often
with
the
precisely
the
same
dilemma
or
trilemma
that
you
mentioned
here,
retaliation,
indictment,
what
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
could
not
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’re
only
dealing
with
the
rare
cases.
those
are
the
only
ones
that
come
up
here,
you
got
the
rare
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
that
we’re
on
the
court’s
time,
let
me
ask
you
one
question
and
try
to
give
a
brief
answer.
what
was
there
at
the
second
hearing,
at
the
suppression
here
which
alerted
someone
to
the
idea
that
she
did
not
understand
english
in
the
face
of
the
perfectly
clear
unequivocal
answers
which
she
gave
before
the
grand
jury.
what
was
the
change,
after
a
long
lapse
of
time
that
her
english
became
little
fuzzy
or
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
like
everyone
concedes
that
there
was
nothing
to
have
alerted
to
the
grand
jury
foreman
or
the
united
states
attorney
to
the
notion
that
she
did
not
understand
the
questions
when
she
gave
the
rather
clear
answers
which
appear
in
the
record
on
pages
3
and
4.
now,
what
alerted
someone
between
that
time
and
the
hearing
on
the
suppression
motion
to
the
idea
that
she
did
not
understand
english
quite
a
well?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
thank
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
anything
further
mr.
sheehan?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
disposition
of
three
cases
to
announce
in
74-635,
united
states
against
rose
wong
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
with
the
court
filed
this
morning.
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
that
court
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
