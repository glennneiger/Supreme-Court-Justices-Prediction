mr.
allan
brotsky
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
assume
from
the
argument
of
the
government
that
the
government
would
concede
that
effective
warnings
concerning
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
must
be
given
to
a
putative
defendant
grand
jury
witness.
although,
this
court
reserved
that
question
specifically
in
mandujano,
i
think
it
has
to
meet
that
issue
squarely
here
and
i
think
that
after
cases
like
beckwith
and
goner
last
term,
there
can
hardly
be
any
doubt
that
the
fifth
amendment
requires
that
an
uninformed
ignorant
witness,
that
is
ignorant
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege,
be
effectively
informed
of
his
rights
to
decline
to
answer
questions,
the
answers
to
which
would
incriminate
him,
or
else,
the
fifth
amendment
would
virtually
be
rendered
meaningless
before
grand
juries.
mr.
allan
brotsky
i
believe
it
is,
but
i
think
before
we
can
complain
of
what
happened
to
mrs.
wong,
it
has
to
be
held
that
she
had
a
right
to
be
warned.
now,
whether
you
consider
that
a
formula
to
ensure
the
infective
enforcement
of
the
fifth
amendment,
or
a
right
compelled
by
the
fifth
amendment.
i
think
it
must
be
clear
to
this
court
by
now
that
such
effective
information
to
an
ignorant
witness,
subpoenaed
before
a
grand
jury
is
necessary
in
order
that
the
fifth
amendment
have
any
meaning.
now
that
being
the
case,
i
think
it
also
important
for
this
court
to
understand
that
we
also
rely
on
the
due
process
clause
here
for
our
contention
that
the
court
of
appeals
must
correct
in
affirming
the
order
of
the
district
court
suppressing
her
testimony.
our
position
is
that
mrs.
wong
was
placed
in
a
cruel
trilemma
to
use
the
language
of
murphy
versus
waterfront
and
other
cases,
without
knowing
that
she
had
a
right
to
decline
to
answer,
she
had
the
option
only
of
incriminating
herself
or
of
perjuring
herself.
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
said
and
what
the
government,
i
think
fails
to
understand
is
that
very
trilemma
or
dilemma
as
it's
been
called,
is
so
unfair,
is
so
essentially
wrong
that
it
in
and
of
itself
violates
due
process,
and
this
is
true
whether
the
dilemma
that
the
witness
faces
is
created
by
intentional
activity
on
the
part
of
the
government,
declining
to
inform
witness
of
the
privilege
or
whether
in
this
case,
it
comes
about
despite
what
i
felt
was
a
good
faith
effort
to
do
so.
in
short,
the
dilemma,
the
cruelty,
the
unfairness
does
not
depend
on
government
misconduct,
and
i
think
that
government
misconceives
the
meaning
of
due
process
when
it
says
that
an
essential
ingredient
of
a
violation
of
due
process
is
that
there
must
be
some
affirmative
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
government.
mr.
allan
brotsky
that
is
available
to
a
witness
that
knows
that
that
can
be
done,
but
when
the
prosecutor
in
this
case
asked
mrs.
wong,
rather
when
he
was
asked
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress,
what
the
situation
was
in
that
regard
and
when
she
was
asked
and
he
asked
her,
she
said
she
thought
that
she
had
to
answer
every
question.
now,
i
would
agree
with
you
sir
that
if
she
had
done
that,
ignorant
as
she
was,
that
a
chain
of
events
would
have
been
set
in
sequence
that
might
well
have
resulted
in
her
becoming
educated
because
she
would
then
have
been
subjected
to
the
contempt
part
of
the
court.
in
exerting
that
contempt
part,
the
court
would
have
appointed
counsel
to
represent
her
and
counsel
could
then
have
effectively
informed
her
of
her
privilege,
but
she
didn’t
know
she
had
that
alternative
mr.
chief
justice.
she
answered
mr.
ward
when
he
asked
her
at
the
hearing
to
the
effect
that
i
thought
i
had
to
answer
every
question.
so
in
that
respect,
i
think
she
had
the
alternative,
but
she
did
not
exercise
it.
mr.
allan
brotsky
her
understanding
at
what
stage
sir?
mr.
allan
brotsky
there
was
an
interpreter
in
the
hearing
before
the
district
court,
clearly
there
was.
and
her
answers
were
given
through
the
interpreter
as
well
as
the
questions
put
to
her
with
the
interpreter.
mr.
allan
brotsky
yes.
i
believe
the
case
is
uphold
as
in
that
position.
now,
if
it
is
true
that
the
violation
is
one
of
due
process,
then
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
the
testimony
whether
it’s
exculpatory
as
was
the
case
here
or
inculpatory
that
a
self
incriminatory
must
be
suppressed.
and
the
reason
for
that
i
think
stems
from
cases
like
lisenba
versus
california
where
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
aim
of
the
requirement
of
due
process
is
not
to
exclude
presumptively
false
evidence,
but
to
prevent
fundamental
unfairness
in
the
use
of
evidence
whether
true
or
false.
in
short,
to
vindicate
the
violation
of
the
due
process
amendment
which
occurred
here,
to
correct
it,
to
deter
future
instances,
it
is
essential
that
whether
the
testimony
given
as
the
result
of
this
dilemma,
or
this
unfair
position
in
which
the
witness
is
placed,
be
suppressed
whether
it
exculpates
or
inculpates
the
witness.
now
in
that
respect,
i
think
that
there
is
no
question
that
the
reason
--
mr.
allan
brotsky
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
a
few
words
i
think
are
in
order
concerning
the
critical
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
mandujano
case.
i
think
the
distinction
that
your
honors
have
recognized
by
denying
that
government’s
motion
for
summary
disposition
of
this
case
following
the
mandujano
opinion.
mandujano
was
aware
of
his
privilege.
he
could
have
claimed
his
privilege
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
in
the
plurality
opinion.
having
that
ability,
he
did
not
do
so.
mr.
allan
brotsky
that’s
correct.
mr.
allan
brotsky
correct.
so
in
mandujano,
there
was
no
either
dilemma
or
trilemma.
there
was
no
subjecting
of
the
witness
to
this
unfair
cruel,
if
you
will,
situation.
mr.
allan
brotsky
i
personally
think
that
such
a
warning
is
equally,
perhaps
not
equally
but
it
is
essential
as
well.
i
think
that
if
you
warn
of
the
--
or
advice
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
because
of
the
intricacies
of
the
privilege,
it
would
be
appropriate
and
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
amendment
and
particularly
to
avoid
distinctions
between
those
who
can
afford
counsel
and
those
who
cannot.
mr.
allan
brotsky
i
think
so.
i
think,
however,
that
i
should
say
this.
this
is
an
illustration
of
how
one
violation
is
inextricably
linked
with
another.
the
right
to
be
advised
of
the
privilege
flows
from
the
self
incrimination
aspect
of
the
fifth
amendment,
but
it
is
the
failure
to
advice
that
brings
into
play
the
due
process
violation
because
only
where
there
is
a
failure
to
advice,
do
you
have
this
dilemma.
so,
i
would
say
then
that
when
a
witness,
a
putative
of
defendant
witness
comes
before
a
grand
jury
and
he
is
not
advised,
effectively
informed
of
the
privilege,
you
have
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
self
incrimination
right.
that
violation,
once
you
ask
a
question
and
subject
the
witness
to
the
dilemma
or
trilemma
that
we’re
talking
about,
then
becomes
a
violation
of
due
process.
mr.
allan
brotsky
no.
i
think
that
--
mr.
allan
brotsky
i
think
i
am
distinguishing
mr.
justice
white
between
the
conduct
of
the
government
and
the
objective
reality
which
the
government
has
before
it.
in
this
case,
--
mr.
allan
brotsky
i
think
that
i
would
have
to
answer
you
with
what
mr.
justice
brennan
said
in
the
mandujano
case.
that
presents
the
most
difficult
situation,
but
i
don’t
think
we
have
to
reach
that
here
at
all.
i
think
we
can
define
what
we
mean
by
a
putative
defendant
in
terms
of
what
the
government
knows
when
it
calls
the
witness.
mr.
allan
brotsky
yes.
i
think
that
is
an
ingredient,
an
essential
ingredient
of
our
case.
mr.
allan
brotsky
i
think,
she
should
have
been
told
either
through
an
interpreter
or
in
language
that
would
have
effectively
told
her
that
she
had
a
right
to
decline
to
answer
questions
based
on
her
fifth
amendment
privilege.
now,
did
she
--
how
could
he
bit
--
excuse
me,
done
that?
mr.
allan
brotsky
let
me
leave
that
to
the
case
that
follows
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
don’t
think
i
have
to
reach
it
in
this
case
and
i
had
rather
not
be
philosophical.
i
am
concerned
about
rose
wong,
and
as
a
matter
of
academic
interest,
yes,
i
believe
that
more
than
that
is
required.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
personally
believe
and
concur
with
your
position
that
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
of
an
informed
--
by
an
informed
defendant
is
essential
of
way
to
preserve
fifth
amendment
values,
but
that
doesn’t
arise
in
this
case.
mr.
allan
brotsky
only
in
this
respect
mr.
chief
justice.
i
agree
completely
that
the
grand
jury
setting
is
different,
wholly
different
from
the
custodial
interrogation
of
the
police.
mr.
allan
brotsky
yes,
i
think
that
without
reaching
the
waiver
problem
because
it
isn’t
presented
here,
i
think
that
the
coercion
inherent
in
custodial
interrogation
which
forces
--
which
compels
the
suspect
to
talk
is
assumed
before
the
grand
jury.
when
you’re
subpoenaed
before
the
grand
jury,
you
must
talk,
you
got
to
answer
every
question.
as
the
mandujano
makes
very
plain
and
as
it
reminds
us,
this
has
been
the
rule
since
this
court
was
founded.
mr.
allan
brotsky
yes
and
frankly
--
mr.
allan
brotsky
that’s
right.
mr.
allan
brotsky
that’s
right.
but
miranda
also
teaches
mr.
chief
justice
that
whether
the
statements
made
following
the
failure
to
observe
the
miranda
ritual,
whether
exculpatory
or
inculpatory
may
not
be
used.
now,
i
would
agree
with
you
that
the
oath
makes
a
substantial
difference
in
the
sense
that
the
witness,
had
the
witness
been
informed
with
no
that
perjury
was
--
the
oath
itself
is
adequate
warning
that
they
must
tell
the
truth.
but
the
difference
between
--
mrs.
wong
situation
and
mandujano
situation
was
that
he
knew
he
could
decline
to
answer
and
she
did
not.
she
had
no
other
alternative
than
to
either
incriminate
herself
or
perjure
herself.
to
either
exculpate
her
or
inculpate
herself.
mr.
allan
brotsky
she
is
not
a
pauper.
mr.
allan
brotsky
well,
i
can’t
say
that.
she
did
not
have
an
attorney
when
she
was
called
and
when
she
retained
me,
she
paid
a
modest
fee.
mr.
allan
brotsky
i
think
that
--
mr.
allan
brotsky
the
significance
--
mr.
allan
brotsky
i
think
that
may
well
be
true.
on
the
other
hand
as
i
said,
until
you’re
informed
of
your
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment,
you
are
in
a
position
of
having
to
answer
incriminatory
questions
and,
that’s
a
situation
of
mrs.
wong.
mr.
allan
brotsky
you
could.
there’s
no
doubt
that
--
mr.
allan
brotsky
that’s
right
and
perhaps
it
could
be
said
that
she
could
be
criticized
for
not
having
consulted
an
attorney
before
going
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
allan
brotsky
no
question
about
that.
the
thing
that
i
think,
this
court
has
to
confront
is
whether
when
the
choice
is
between
the
truth
or
incriminating
one
self,
or
as
in
this
case
since
she
did
come
from
china
town
and
since
there
is
a
tradition
in
china
town
that
informers
are
physically
retaliated
against,
she
had
even
more
of
a
subjective
reason
to
fear
inculpatory
statements.
she
feared
physical
harm
to
herself
or
her
family.
there
is
no
question
mr.
chief
justice
that
it
is
essential
that
people
tell
the
truth.
but,
i
don’t
think
that
our
constitution
fails
to
distinguish
between
those
who
knowing
of
their
rights,
knowing
they
can
keep
quite,
then
deliberately
tell
falsehoods
and
those
who
have
no
such
option,
i
think
there
is
a
real
distinction.
mr.
allan
brotsky
of
course,
had
she
told
the
prosecuting
attorney
what
he
wanted
to
hear,
she
would
inevitably
have
been
called.
his
purpose
was
to
find
out
what
she
knew
so
that
he
could
utilize
her
testimony
in
a
trial
against
the
officers
that
he
claimed
--
mr.
allan
brotsky
that’s
correct.
that’s
what
he
wanted.
mr.
allan
brotsky
i
think
that
this
was
a
subject
factor,
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
necessary
to
the
decision
in
this
case.
i
think
the
dilemma
of
course
is
simply
by
incriminating
one
self
versus
perjuring
one
self
is
sufficiently
unfair
dilemma
to
call
into
play
the
due
process
guarantee.
now,
i
just
want
to
make
a
few
more
points.
as
i
say,
there
is
this
connection
between
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self
incrimination
and
the
due
process
violation.
now,
when
the
witness
is
affectively
not
informed
and
you
have
both
violations,
then
the
question
arises
what
is
the
remedy?
i
think
the
remedy
and
here
again
you
have
a
distinction
between
the
situation
posed
by
knox,
by
bryson
where
you
did
not
have
this
dilemma
in
the
same
sense.
where
in
bryson’s
case,
he
could
have
resigned
as
an
officer
or
declined
to
answer,
he
knew
of
his
privilege;
mrs.
wong
did
not
know
of
hers.
i
think
the
appropriate
remedy
is
to
restore
the
witness
to
the
position,
the
witness
would
have
been
in,
had
the
witness
known
of
the
privilege
and
exercise
that
namely
to
suppress
all
the
testimony
whether
it’s
exculpatory.
mr.
allan
brotsky
i
don’t
think
so
mr.
justice
white
for
this
reason.
mr.
allan
brotsky
if
the
answers
might
incriminate,
then
i
think
you
are
reaching
the
point
where
that
is
true.
but
--
mr.
allan
brotsky
alright,
i
agree
you’re
posing
the
most
difficult
question,
administratively
and
philosophically,
but
that’s
not
the
problem
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
allan
brotsky
no
doubt
about
it,
but
i
know
that
as
a
practical
matter
and
in
real
life
things
don’t
happen
that
way.
the
u.s.
attorney
generally
knows
whether
the
witness
that
he’s
calling,
generally
knows.
mr.
allan
brotsky
alright,
i
agree.
but
i
think
that
this
is
not
the
situation
we
have
here
nor
is
it
necessary
to
decide
that
question
because
you
have
clearly
here
a
putative
defendant.
the
finding
was
to
that
effect
and
certainly
the
government
has
not
denied
it.
mr.
allan
brotsky
no.
mr.
allan
brotsky
i
am
not
--
mr.
allan
brotsky
no,
i
don’t
think
so.
i
think
--
mr.
allan
brotsky
it’s
possible.
but,
we
are
talking
probabilities
now.
mr.
allan
brotsky
usually,
that
person
has
an
attorney
to
represent
them
or
the
attorney
for
the
defendant
will
make
sure
they
do.
mr.
allan
brotsky
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
allan
brotsky
i
would
say
wherever
there
is
ignorance,
wherever
there’s
reason
with
ground
--
mr.
allan
brotsky
no,
it’s
not
yes.
it’s
only
if
the
situation
is
one
in
which
the
government
knows
there
is
ignorance
or
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe
there
is
ignorance.
for
example,
if
the
person
shows
up
with
an
attorney,
obviously,
there
is
no
cost
to
believe
that
the
witness
is
ignorant.
we
are
talking
about
ignorance
here,
that’s
really
what
i
think
we’re
addressing
ourselves
to
because
while
mr.
justice
--
mr.
allan
brotsky
i
understand
that.
mr.
allan
brotsky
no,
i
am
talking
about
ignorance
on
the
part
of
the
witness.
if
you
have
a
situation
where
the
witness
is
in
fact
ignorant,
now
when
must
the
government
do
it?
i
think
if
you
think
of
the
situation
here,
clearly
the
government
has
to
do
it
here,
where
they
know
that
the
witness,
according
to
the
police
officers
has
offered
bribes,
paid
bribes
is
implicated
in
the
gambling
establishment.
and
where
they
call
her
precisely
to
implicate
her
self
and
others,
clearly
then
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
have
a
warning
to
that
kind
of
witness.
now,
this
other
cases
are
harder.
there
is
no
question
about
that,
but
in
this
case,
you
don’t
have
those
difficult
problems.
mr.
allan
brotsky
well,
if
that’s
what
mr.
justice
white
meant,
then
i
misunderstood.
if
the
government
has
no
knowledge
that
the
witness
is
involved
(voice
overlap)
mr.
allan
brotsky
oh,
i
think
that
the
government
would
have
to.
yes,
i
think
that
government
would
have
to
advice
that
--
mr.
allan
brotsky
that’s
right.
i
think
--
mr.
allan
brotsky
well
--
mr.
allan
brotsky
alright.
mr.
allan
brotsky
no,
i
don’t
think
so.
i
think
that
had
they
given
them
--
first,
my
reply
would
be
what
harm
does
it
do
to
the
government
to
give
the
warnings?
mr.
allan
brotsky
i
understand.
i
think
the
government
is
giving
the
very
warnings
here
that
we’re
talking
about.
they
haven’t
told
us
why
they
do
it,
but
they
uniformally
do
it.
i
think
it’s
because
they
recognize
that
it
is
essentially
unfair
not
to.
now,
if
you
have
a
situation
you
postulated,
then,
i
think
the
government
has
an
equal
duty
where
the
government
knows
that
the
person
is
implicated
and
calls
that
person
with
an
intent
and
design
to
extract
incriminatory
information,
and
i
think
the
government
should
advise
the
person
of
that
person’s
rights.
in
a
minute
or
two
that
i
have
left,
i
do
want
to
say
something
about
the
perjury
question.
i
think
this
court
does
have
and
must
have
a
legitimate
concern
that
perjury
violations
be
punished.
but
i
think
again
here,
there
is
a
difference
between
the
kind
of
perjury
you
have
where
one
is
aware
of
the
privilege
and
instead
of
exercising
it,
remaining
silent,
affirmatively
misstates
or
lies.
to
suppress
false
testimony
that
is
induced
by
a
cruel
dilemma,
and
that’s
what
i
think
happened
here
is,
not
the
licensed
perjury.
mr.
allan
brotsky
that’s
right,
but
i
am
saying,
you
are
merely
restoring
that
person
to
the
position
they
would
be
in
had
they
known
of
the
privilege.
mr.
allan
brotsky
that’s
right,
had
mrs.
wong,
i
can
assure
this
court
that
had
mrs.
wong
known
of
her
privilege,
she
would
have
exercised
it.
she
would
have
given
no
answers
to
the
questions
which
are
the
subject
to
the
perjury
prosecution.
what
i’m
saying
therefore
is
that
if
that
is
the
case
and
if
she
faced
the
dilemma
she
did,
i
think
this
court’s
legitimate
concern
for
perjury
is
not
appropriately
addressed
to
her
situation.
i
think
to
as
a
court
of
appeals
said,
to
suppress
testimony
which
in
this
case
exculpated
her
and
which
the
prosecutor
thereby
then
promptly
indicted
her
for
perjury
because
it
was
contrary
to
the
information
he
had
for
her
to
do
that.
mr.
allan
brotsky
mr.
justice
stevens,
if
you
knew
rose
wong,
you
would
be
sure
as
i
am.
mr.
allan
brotsky
i
don’t
see
how
they
could
on
the
record,
i
don’t
see
how
they
could.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
hearing,
there
was
a
question
that
the
judge
raised,
now
the
final
question
would
be
if
she
had
known
of
her
privilege
which
he
has
claimed
it
and
he
didn’t
ask
it
because
i
think
he
assumed
after
seeing
mrs.
wong
that
should
would
have
--
mr.
allan
brotsky
i
think
so.
mr.
allan
brotsky
because
i
think
the
government
knowing
that,
it
is
eliciting
from
her
by
its
questions,
incriminatory
answers
is
fording
the
purposes
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
is
taking
our
system
of
justice
and
ignoring
the
mandate
of
the
fifth
amendment
when
one
does
so.
i
think
that
--
mr.
allan
brotsky
if
you
know
about
it.
i
think
ignorance
of
the
fifth
amendment
which
is
the
situation
here
presents
an
entirely
--
mr.
allan
brotsky
i
didn’t
hear
you.
mr.
allan
brotsky
i
think
if
the
government
new
the
questions
were
--
yes,
i
think
i
she
were
indigent
--
mr.
allan
brotsky
no,
no.
mr.
allan
brotsky
no,
well,
i’m
saying
that
--
mr.
allan
brotsky
that
they
have
to
advise
her.
i
am
not
saying
that
they
have
--
mr.
allan
brotsky
because
i
don’t
think
that
the
fact
that
she
was
an
indigent
really
is
relevant
here
since
when
she
appeared,
she
was
given
the
option
of
having
an
attorney.
mr.
allan
brotsky
i
suppose
that’s
true.
but
in
any
event,
what
happened
is
--
mr.
allan
brotsky
the
judge
indicated
she
did
not.
judge
zirpoly
said
--
found
in
effect
that
she
did
not
understand,
none
advising
her
of
her
rights
except
to
perjury.
mr.
allan
brotsky
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
you
may
have
misconceived
what
happened
at
the
second
hearing.
we
made
a
motion
to
suppress
based
on
the
claim
the
she
did
not
understand
the
warnings.
mr.
allan
brotsky
when
she
came
to
me
and
talked
to
me,
i
could
see
that
she
didn’t
understand
english
very
well.
i
had
a
different
view
than
the
united
states
attorney.
i
immediately
--
i
have
more
familiarity
with
china
town,
san
francisco
than
he
did,
and
he
admitted
in
the
record
that
he
had
no
such
familiarity.
the
judge
pointed
out
at
the
hearing
that
there
was
several
times
when
she
answered
questions
that
might
well
have
alerted
him
that
she
needed
an
interpreter.
mr.
allan
brotsky
thank
you.
