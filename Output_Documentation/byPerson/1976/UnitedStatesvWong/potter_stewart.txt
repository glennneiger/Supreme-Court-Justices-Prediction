justice
potter
stewart
mr.
sheehan,
in
view
of
the
district
court’s
findings
that
she
didn’t
understand
these
warnings
that
analysis
in
this
case
has
to
proceed
upon
the
premise
that
the
situation
here
was
tantamount
to
the
situation
that
would
exist
if
no
warnings
had
been
given.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
--
so
you
accept
that
premise?
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
just
ask
you
this
before
you
proceed
to
that
point?
am
i
correct
in
my
recollection
that
in
the
mandujano
case,
mr.
mandujano
was
advised
and
informed
of
his
constitutional
privilege
against
compulsory
self
incrimination?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
correct
and
that
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
here,
we
proceed
on
the
premise
that
mrs.
wong
was
not?
