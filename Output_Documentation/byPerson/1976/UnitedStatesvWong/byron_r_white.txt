do
you
think
the
same
analysis
would
apply
when
witness
the
government
does
not
expect
it
might
indict?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
not?
i
thought
you
really
weren't
relying
on
the
conduct
of
the
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
ordinary
witness
that
the
government
doesn’t
really
know
about,
but
they
just
call
him
as
a
witness,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
does
have
some
problems
about
self
incrimination,
and
he
is
not
advised
or
warned
and
he’s
asked
some
questions.
and
here
in
his
own
mind,
his
choices
either
to
refuse
to
answer,
to
incriminate
himself
or
to
perjure
himself?
that’s
the
way
it
is
as
a
matter
of
fact?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
do
--
so
you
think
there
is
a
substantial
dimension
to
your
case
based
on
the
government’s
conduct,
namely,
its
knowledge
and
its
calling
him
as
the
witness
and
not
informing
him
clearly?
justice
byron
r.
white
again,
these
arguments
put
almost
any
witness
rather
than
just
one
who
is
a
putative
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn’t
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
answers
might
incriminate?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
the
government
knows
it
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
ordinary
witness
called
than
an
ordinary
--
in
any
lawsuit
or
in
any
criminal
case
in
an
open
court
room?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
hopes
he
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
government,
who
thinks
that
co-conspirators
would
testify
against
somebody
who’s
on
trial,
and
they
call
him,
put
him
on
the
stand?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
i’m
asking
is
whether
you
think
that
government
has
to
warn
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
know,
you
say
implicated?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
your
answer
is
yes.
the
same
rule
would
apply
as
you
are
dealing
with
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
government
calls
a
co-conspirator
or
someone
who
thinks
that
on
their
side
of
the
case
to
prove
a
case
against
the
defendant,
you
must
give
him
the
warning?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government
is
frankly
surprised.
they
think
they
are
going
to
get
some
testimony
out
of
somebody
that
certain
line
of
some
and
it
turns
out
they
don’t
get
it
and
let’s
assume
they
then
prosecute
him
for
perjury?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
it’s
because
they
thought
they
suspected
and/or
thought
they
knew
he
was
implicated
in
the
crime
that
they
had
to
give
him
warnings,
that
they
cannot
prosecute
him
for
perjury?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
question
is
whether
it’s
constitutionally
required
