mr.
sheehan,
i’m
just
wondering
why
you’re
going
through
these
specs?
didn't
the
lower
court
find
specifically
that
she
did
not
understand
and
though
we
have
to
accept
that
as
a
finding
for
purposes
of
appeal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
case
involve
any
issue
with
respect
to
the
adequacy
of
the
warnings
pertaining
to
perjury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
it's
important
as
to
whether
or
not
the
prosecutor
deliberately
misled
her
of
simply
that
she
was
misled?
is
that
critical
to
the
due
process
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
she
did
not
understand
is
the
point,
i
guess
rather
than
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
didn’t
quite
understand
the
relevance
of
the
details
of
the
testimony.
it's
only
we
have
two
very
simple
clear
cut
findings
as
i
understood
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
brotsky,
if
you
put
it
on
the
government
ignorance,
they
were
ignorant
here
as
the
fact
that
she
didn’t
understand
the
warning?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
haven’t
you
give
them
your
case
solely?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
mr.
justice
white
was
asking
you
supposing
at
the
same
facts
about
mrs.
wong
that
she
were
called
in
a
trial
of
mr.
x,
why
is
it
the
same
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
she
is
not
a
putative
defendant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
m.
brotsky,
how
can
you
be
so
positive
that
she
would
not
committed
perjury
if
she
knew
of
her
privilege?
lots
of
people
know
their
privilege
and
still
decide
it
would
be
better
not
to
act
guilty
by
claiming
the
privilege
and
it
would
try
and
get
away
with
a
false
story
and
how
do
we
know
she
didn’t
simply
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
we
would
not
be
able
to
deal
with,
but
there
is
no
reason
on
the
record
to
believe
that’s
the
fact,
isn’t
it,
to
say
(voice
overlap)?
