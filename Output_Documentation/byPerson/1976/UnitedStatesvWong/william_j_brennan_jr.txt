brennan,
jr.
mr.
brotsky,
precisely
what
do
you
think
the
witness
should
have
been
told?
what
was
the
information
of
that
the
witness
should
have
been
told?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nothing
more
than
that,
in
other
words,
you
do
not
suggest
that
she
should
have
been
told
that
maybe
a
possibility
that
this
grand
jury
is
going
to
indict
her?
