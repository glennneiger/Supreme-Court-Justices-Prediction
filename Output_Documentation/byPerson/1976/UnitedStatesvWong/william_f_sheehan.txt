mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
that
court
affirmed
the
order
of
united
states
district
court,
suppressing
for
use
in
evidence
in
respondent’s
perjury
prosecution,
the
testimony
that
she
previously
gave
before
the
grand
jury.
this
case
and
the
next
one
following
it
both
involve
the
broad
question
whether
the
constitution
requires
that
the
government
give
any
sort
of
warnings
to
grand
jury
witnesses
when
the
government
has
reason
to
believe
that
the
witness
maybe
indicted
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
that
is
sought
from
them.
this
case,
however,
can
be
decided,
and
indeed,
we
think
that
it
should
be
decided
on
a
more
narrow
ground,
for
this
is
a
perjury
case
and
there
are
special
policies
applicable
in
such
cases
as
this
court
recognized
last
term
in
united
states
against
mandujano.
those
policies
in
our
view
apply
here
and
they
warrant
a
reversal
without
consideration
of
whether
warnings
are
required.
the
facts
were
these.
on
september
7,
1973
the
respondent
rose
wong
appeared
pursuant
to
a
subpoena
before
a
grand
jury
in
the
northern
district
of
california.
she
was
called
to
testify
as
part
of
the
government’s
investigation
into
gambling
and
bribery
in
the
china
town
section
of
san
francisco.
the
government
already
had
evidence
that
she
had
paid
bribes
to
certain
police
officers
who
were
cooperating
with
the
fbi.
it
was
thought
that
she
or
other
persons
unknown
to
the
grand
jury
might
also
have
paid
bribes
to
other
police
officers
who
were
not
cooperating
with
the
government
and
it
was
in
part
to
learn
the
identity
of
these
other
officers
that
she
was
called
to
testify.
when
she
appeared
before
the
grand
jury,
the
grand
jury
formally
administered
the
oath
and
right
after
that,
the
government
attorney
told
her
what
the
nature
of
the
grand
jury
investigation
was
and
what
its
purpose
was,
that
it
was
investigating
bribery
and
gambling
in
china
town.
she
was
told
the
she
had
been
called
because
it
was
thought
the
she
had
information
that
might
be
helpful
to
the
government’s
investigation.
at
that
point,
the
government
attorney
gave
her
a
series
of
warnings.
she
was
never
told
that
she
was
required
to
answer
all
the
questions
that
were
put
to
her.
she
was
told
instead
that
she
could
refuse
to
answer
any
question
that
she
felt
might
tend
to
incriminate
her.
this
advice
was
repeated
twice.
she
was
told
this
was
a
constitutional
privilege
of
hers.
she
was
asked
if
she
understood
and
she
said
that
she
did.
she
was
then
told
that
anything
that
she
said
could
be
used
against
her
in
a
subsequent
prosecution
and
she
said
she
understood.
she
was
told
that
she
had
the
right
to
consult
with
an
attorney
before
answering
any
questions.
she
said
she
understood.
she
was
asked
if
she
had
already
consulted
with
a
lawyer,
she
said
she
had
not.
she
was
told
that
she
could
stop
the
questioning
at
any
time
that
she
felt
necessary
to
do
so.
she
said
she
understood
that.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
the
lower
court
found
specifically
that
she
did
not
understand
the
warnings
regarding
the
privilege.
the
lower
court
found
that
she
did
understand
the
warnings
regarding
perjury
which
i
was
about
to
say
that
she
did
receive.
that
was
explained
to
her
that
she
would
be
liable
to
a
prosecution
for
perjury.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
no,
it
does
not.
i
go
through
this
recitation
principally
because
there
is
a
due
process
claim
here
that
in
some
manner,
the
government’s
conduct
in
this
particular
case
was
offensive
to
notions
of
due
process
and
it
seems
to
me
important
that
the
court
--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
we
think
that
the
proper
--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
we
think
that
the
proper
analysis
is
under
the
self
incrimination
clause
as
i
will
come
to.
i
think
the
government’s
conduct
here
is
really
beyond
reproach.
in
fact,
her
attorney
at
the
hearing
on
our
motion
to
suppress
said
that
he
was
calling
the
government’s
conduct
into
question
in
this
case.
the
district
court
found
that
the
government’s
conduct
was
not
to
be
criticized
in
this
case,
the
conduct
of
the
government
attorney
and
indeed,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
government
had
acted
in
good
faith.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
yes,
that
is
correct.
we
do
not
contend
otherwise.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
yes,
yes.
we
do
not
contend
--
we
do
not
contest
the
fining
of
the
district
court
that
she
was
unable
to
understand
the
warnings
regarding
the
privilege
and
she
was
then
in
effect
in
the
position
of
one
who
had
received
no
warnings.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
the
predicate
for
our
suggestion
that
the
case
can
be
decided
on
a
narrow
ground
is
because
we
think
that
it
does
not
matter
whether
or
not
she
had
received
warnings,
effective
or
otherwise.
we
think
that
this
case
is
controlled
entirely
by
united
states
against
mandujano
which
was
decided
last
term.
in
that
case
as
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
had
held
that
the
government’s
failure
to
advise
a
potential
defendant
of
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
was
a
bar
to
the
use
of
the
witnesses’
testimony
and
a
subsequent
prosecution
for
perjury.
this
court
reversed,
although
there
were
several
opinions,
all
of
the
justices
who
participated
agreed
that
whether
or
not
warnings
were
required,
a
witness
could
not
commit
perjury
and
thereafter
claim
that
the
privilege
self
incrimination
was
a
protection
from
prosecution
for
perjury.
and
indeed,
all
of
the
justices
were
in
agreement
that
on
the
facts
of
the
case
in
mandujano,
there
was
no
due
process
violation.
the
facts
here
are
in
all
relevant
respects
the
same
and
we
believe
the
results
should
be
as
well.
now,
although
the
court
of
appeals'
rule
that
its
result
could
not
be
sustained
under
the
self
incrimination
clause,
respondent
has
argued
that
indeed,
her
position
is
supported
by
the
self
incrimination
clause
and
accordingly,
i
will
take
that
matter
up
first.
it
is
well
settled
that
that
constitutional
provision
does
not
protect
against
the
crime
of
perjury.
the
opinions
in
mandujano
to
that
effect
did
not
state
a
new
doctrine.
in
the
glickstein
case
and
the
knox
case
and
the
bryson
case,
this
court
said
that
coercion
may
not
avoided
by
perjury.
one
central
rational
behind
those
cases
applies
squarely
here.
in
making
the
statements
that
are
the
subject
of
the
indictment
in
this
case,
the
respondent
was
not
indeed
incriminating
herself
in
regard
to
a
past
crime.
she
was
instead
committing
a
new
crime.
however,
broad
the
protection
afforded
by
the
privilege,
it
is
not
a
license
to
commit
perjury.
the
respondent
argues
that
this
case
is
not
the
same
as
mandujano,
and
that
the
use
of
her
testimony
in
the
prosecution
for
perjury
would
violate
her
privilege.
she
says
that
it
was
important
to
the
result
in
mandujano
that
in
that
case,
the
witness
had
received
warnings
and
understood
warnings
apparently,
and
that
she
not
having
understood
them
and
having
been
in
the
position
therefore
of
one
who
had
not
received
warnings
will
somehow
compelled
against
her
will
to
lie
in
response
to
the
questions
put
by
the
government
attorney.
in
our
view,
it
was
entirely
irrelevant
in
mandujano
that
the
witness
there
had
received
warnings.
and
the
reason
that
it
was
irrelevant
is
because
even
if
the
witness
had
been
compelled
to
testify
in
mandujano,
that
would
not
have
protected
him
from
a
prosecution
for
perjury.
in
support
of
this
proposition,
i
rely
upon
the
cases
that
the
court
in
mandujano
relied
upon.
the
first
of
those
was
the
glickstein
case.
there,
the
defendant
testified
under
the
compulsion
of
the
statute
that
granted
him
immunity.
this
court
said
that
as
a
constitutional
matter,
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
could
be
overborne
and
the
government
could
compel
testimony,
even
incriminating
testimony,
provided
that
it
granted
an
immunity
co-extensive
with
the
privilege.
the
court
then
said
that
as
a
corollary
to
the
power,
to
the
government’s
power
to
compel
testimony,
it
must
also
have
the
power
to
assure
that
whatever
the
testimony
is
given
in
response
to
that
compulsion
would
be
truthful.
in
that
case,
the
statute
in
question
was
held
to
confer
an
immunity
no
broader
than
the
constitution
and
the
use
of
the
defendant’s
testimony
was
upheld
not
withstanding
that
he
had
given
it
under
compulsion.
the
knox
case
and
the
bryson
cases
are
both
much
the
same.
in
knox,
the
federal
statute
made
it
criminal
for
certain
persons
to
fail
to
file
a
certain
form.
in
response
to
this
compulsion,
knox
filed
a
form
that
contained
falsehoods,
and
he
was
then
prosecuted
under
another
statute
forbidding
false
statements.
even
though
under
marchetti
and
grosso,
under
those
subsequent
cases,
knox
would
have
been
protected
by
his
privilege
from
filing
any
form
at
all,
his
filing
of
a
false
form
was
held
unprotected.
the
court
noted
that
the
prosecution
was
not
based
on
any
incriminatory
information
that
was
given
in
submission
to
compulsion.
neither
was
the
prosecution
in
mandujano,
neither
is
the
prosecution
here.
when
each
of
these
witnesses
responded
to
any
pressure
that
they
may
have
felt
that
they
were
under
by
giving
false
testimony,
that
as
the
court
said
in
knox
was
simply
not
testimonial
compulsion.
in
bryson,
the
court
put
the
matter
quite
simply.
there
is
no
privilege
to
answer
fraudulently
a
question
that
the
government
should
not
have
asked.
there
is
therefore
no
meaningful
difference
between
this
case
and
knox,
and
bryson
and
glickstein,
whether
or
not
the
witnesses
in
those
case
knew
that
they
had
a
privilege
was
whether
or
not
they
knew
that
they
had
a
privilege
was
not
important
since
they
cannot
realistically
have
exercised
it
anyway.
whether
or
not
the
respondent
here
knew
that
she
had
a
privilege
also
did
not
matter.
even
assuming
then
that
somehow,
her
failure
to
know
of
her
privilege
resulted
in
a
situation
where
the
government
was
compelling
her
to
give
answers
against
her
will.
there
is
nothing
in
the
self
incrimination
clause
that
requires
that
her
false
testimony
be
suppressed
in
the
prosecution
for
perjury.
we
turn
now
to
the
due
process
clause
which
was
relied
upon
by
the
court
below.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
you
are
correct.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
that’s
correct.
and
our
position
is
that
even
though
the
defendant
in
mandujano
received
warnings,
whether
he
understood
them
or
not,
whether
he
received
the
warnings
or
not
was
entirely
irrelevant
to
that
decision
which
was
another
in
a
long
line
of
cases
in
this
court
saying
that
a
response
to
compulsion
by
perjury
is
not
protected
by
the
privilege.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
i
think
agreed
pretty
much
with
so
much
of
what
i’ve
just
said,
and
they
rested
their
result
instead
on
the
due
process
clause.
we
think
that
the
due
process
analysis
adds
very
little
to
the
problem.
to
the
degree
that
any
constitutional
policies
would
appear
to
be
implicated
in
questioning
witnesses
in
circumstances
like
those
here,
those
policies
in
our
view
are
fully
accounted
for
by
the
privilege.
and
indeed,
the
court
below
did
acknowledge
as
much
when
it
said
that
the
procedure
followed
here
by
the
government
was
unfair
because
of
what
the
court
perceived
as
the
threats
that
it
posed
to
the
value
protected
by
the
privilege,
the
values
protected
by
the
privilege.
there
is
a
quotation
from
the
court’s
opinion
at
page
2a
of
our
appendix.
since
there
have
been
no
values
protected
by
the
privilege
that
have
been
violated
here,
in
our
view,
that
should
end
the
case.
but
assuming
that
there
are
some
values
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
self
incrimination
clause
that
are
somehow
implicated
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
the
government’s
conduct
did
not
violate
the
due
process
clause.
we
think
it
is
not
automatically
unfair
to
call
before
the
grand
jury
a
witness
whom
the
government
has
reason
to
believe
is
involved
in
a
crime
under
investigation.
as
this
court
said
in
michigan
against
tucker,
subject
to
applicable
constitutional
limitations,
the
court
has
not
forbidden
all
resort
to
the
defendant
to
make
out
its
case
and
indeed,
we
find
support
for
that
proposition
in
the
schmerber
case
and
the
handwriting
and
voice
exemplar
cases.
it
is
important
to
the
grand
jury’s
task
to
be
able
to
call
before
it
witnesses
who
have
some
knowledge
of
the
crime.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
illustrative.
when
the
grand
jury
called
the
respondent
to
testify,
so
far
is
it
knew,
it
was
facing
a
wide
spread
system
of
police
corruption
in
san
francisco.
in
fulfilling
its
responsibilities
of
determining
whether
crimes
had
been
committed
and
if
so
by
whom,
the
testimony
of
witnesses
like
respondent
who
by
virtue
of
their
involvement
in
the
crime
are
in
the
position
to
know
something
about
it,
is
essential
to
the
grand
jury’s
task.
thus,
we
say
that
without
more
it
could
not
have
been
a
violation
of
due
process
simply
to
call
the
witness
in
front
of
the
grand
jury.
once
she
appeared,
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
the
governments
conduct
was
beyond
reproach.
her
counsel
said
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress,
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
no
criticism
is
intended
here
of
the
prosecutor
who
appeared
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
that
was
page
9
mr.
chief
justice.
on
the
following
page,
the
district
court
said
there
couldn’t
possibly
be
any
question
as
far
as
the
conduct
of
the
united
states
attorney
is
concerned
and
indeed,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
there
was
no
question
as
to
the
good
faith
of
the
government.
the
facts
here
then
are
quite
similar
to
those
in
united
states
against
mandujano.
in
that
case,
all
of
the
justices
were
agreed
that
the
government’s
conduct
had
not
violated
the
due
process
clause.
we
think
here
the
government’s
conduct
has
not
violated
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
chief
justice,
i’ll
reserve
any
time
i
may
have
remaining.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
i
do
not
mr.
chief
justice.
