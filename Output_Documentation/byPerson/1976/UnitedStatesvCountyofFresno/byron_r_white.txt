this
case
comes
to
us
on
appeal
from
an
intermediate
appellate
court
in
the
state
of
california.
it
involves
a
validity
of
a
state
property
tax
on
the
possessory
interest
of
those
who
occupied
tax
exempt
property.
among
other
things,
the
state
levies
a
tax
on
the
employees
of
the
united
states
forest
service
who
occupy
houses
in
the
forest
that
are
furnished
to
them
by
the
united
states
as
part
of
their
compensation.
the
state
has
informative
by
which
it
calculates
the
rental
value
and
levies
a
tax
accordingly.
the
tax
was
challenged
as
invading
the
historic
community
of
the
united
states
from
state
taxation.
the
state
courts
sustained
the
tax
and
the
united
states
brought
the
case
here.
for
the
reasons
that
we
have
stated
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
court,
we
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
california
court
and
sustained
the
state
tax.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
