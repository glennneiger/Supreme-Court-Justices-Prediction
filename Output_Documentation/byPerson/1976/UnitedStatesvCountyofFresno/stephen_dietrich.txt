mr.
stephen
dietrich,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
stephen
dietrich
jr.,
county
counsel
with
the
county
of
tuolomy,
one
of
the
defendants
in
this
case.
i
am
not
sure
that
i
should
be
here
or
mr.
waterman,
or
mr.
shupiro.
i
think
that
what
the
united
states
is
fighting
here
is
a
different
case
and
we
do
not
have
those
facts.
our
case,
of
course,
before
this
court
is
a
taxation
of
forest
service
personnel.
i
think
what
the
united
states
is
fighting
is
the
taxation
of
united
states
military
bases
and
personnel.
but
we
do
not
have
those
facts
before
this
court.
if
the
case
would
never
arise
in
the
county
of
tuolomy,
that
is
you
could
never
get
those
facts
before
this
court
since
we
have
absolutely
no
federal
installations
in
the
county
of
tuolomy.
the
united
states
in
its
brief,
talks
about
the
twelve
forest
service
personnel
and
their
families.
in
the
county
that
they
are
residing,
in
the
twelve
residences
in
the
county
of
tuolomy,
almost
as
if
they
were
chattels.
they
are
bound
to
the
united
states
of
america
twenty-four
hours
a
day,
that
is
not
so.
they
are
living
in
these
homes
with
their
families,
sending
their
children
to
our
schools
and
albeit
they
may
be
on-call
twenty-four
hours
a
day,
they
have
not
sold
their
souls,
as
it
were,
to
the
united
states.
i
cannot
make
a
distinction
between
the
twelve
forest
service
personnel
we
have
here,
and
the
many,
many
more
forest
service
personnel
who
work
in
the
stanislaus
national
forest
in
our
county,
who
reside
off
federal
premises.
they
either
purchase
homes,
and
many
do,
or
they
rent
property.
when
they
purchase
their
home,
they
must
pay
a
property
tax
as
a
homeowner,
when
they
rent
they
are
indirectly
paying
property
tax
unless
they
have
a
landlord
who
does
not
want
to
recoup
his
payment
of
taxes.
and
if
this
particular
individuals
living
in
a
forest
service
housing
are
allowed
not
to
pay
a
tax
or
a
rule
the
tax
is
unconstitutional,
they
are
really
getting
a
better
deal
than
their
counterparts
living
out
on
the
economy
as
it
were.
mr.
stephen
dietrich,
jr.
yes.
mr.
stephen
dietrich,
jr.
they
use
our
county
roads,
they
use
our
county
mental
health
services,
it’s
only
if
they
wish,
and
i
am
not
saying
they
all
do.
the
schools
and
all
the
other
services
that
the
county
provides
with
the
county
hospital;
if
they
should
qualify,
they
may
take
part
in
our
welfare
system.
mr.
stephen
dietrich,
jr.
yes,
the
sheriff’s
department
provides
in
the
un-incorporated
area
in
our
county
and
the
county
is
--
in
our
county
at
least
anyway
we
are
just
starting
to
get
into
a
county-wide
fire
protection
program.
mr.
stephen
dietrich,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
stephen
dietrich,
jr.
i
haven’t
the
slightest
idea
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
dietrich,
jr.
well
they
would
be
a
--
they
may
qualify.
the
rules
are
always
changing,
i
do
not
think
any
of
them
do
yet,
but
the
rules
change
so
fast
my
welfare
director
cannot
keep-up
with
them.
perhaps
a
particular
factual
situation
might
allow
them
to
qualify.
i
do
not
think
there
are
any
on
it
now.
mr.
stephen
dietrich,
jr.
that’s
--
yes
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
dietrich,
jr.
but
they
are
both
would
end-up
paying
a
tax
and
i
think
it
was
testimony
in
our
case
to
the
county
of
fresno
that
the
federal
government
really
does
not
take
into
consideration
the
taxes
--
that
is
right,
i
recall
that,
take
into
consideration
taxes
in
their
formula.
so
actually,
the
federal
government
i
suppose
is
turning
a
profit.
it
might,
dollar
wise,
balance
out
in
your
case
i
think.
mr.
stephen
dietrich,
jr.
but
the
end
result
is
they
would
not
support
our
services
and
the
way
we
look
at
it
is
that
these
people
are
making
a
private
beneficial
use
of
this
property.
they
are
living
on
it
as
a
home.
they
are
not
a
$100,000
houses,
but
the
testimony
in
the
case
was
that
people
living
in
the
homes
found
them
quite
adequate
for
themselves
and
for
their
families,
and
they
did
not
think
they
were
getting
that
bad
of
a
deal.
we
believe
that
these
people
should
help
pay
for
all
those
services
excluding
welfare,
that
they
may
be
using
just
like
i
use,
and
just
like
all
the
rest
of
the
forest
service
personnel
and
the
staffs
of
our
national
forest
use.
mr.
stephen
dietrich,
jr.
that
is
what
in
effect
we
are
doing,
yes.
we
could
not
collect
it
from
the
united
states.
mr.
stephen
dietrich,
jr.
no,
it
comes
from
the
individual.
mr.
stephen
dietrich,
jr.
from
the
tenant.
mr.
stephen
dietrich,
jr.
no,
it
is
for
the
individual
--
mr.
stephen
dietrich,
jr.
it
is
on
the
property
itself.
mr.
stephen
dietrich,
jr.
let
us
say,
if
the
landlord
lives
there
it
is
aimed
at
him,
it’s
the
owner
of
the
property.
mr.
stephen
dietrich,
jr.
because
of
their
private
beneficial
use
of
the
property.
mr.
stephen
dietrich,
jr.
right.
mr.
stephen
dietrich,
jr.
yes,
we
have
quite
a
bag
of
ways
to
gather
taxes.
sales
tax,
property
tax,
or
possessory
interest
tax,
hotel/motel
tax,
we
get
an
awful
lot
of
subvention
funds
from
both
the
federal
government
and
from
the
state
of
california.
mr.
stephen
dietrich,
jr.
gasoline
tax.
mr.
stephen
dietrich,
jr.
cigarette
tax.
mr.
stephen
dietrich,
jr.
if
it
those
we
try
to
tax
them.
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
stephen
dietrich,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
dietrich,
jr.
that
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
stephen
dietrich,
jr.
we
think
we
can
do
this.
thank
you,
your
honor.
