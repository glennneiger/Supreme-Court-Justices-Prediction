unknown
speaker
let
me
put
this
to
the
outset
mr.
shapiro.
suppose
california
and
perhaps
it
does,
but
i
am
not
aware
of
it,
had
a
provision
in
an
state
income
tax
law
or
a
regulation
that
provided
that
whenever
an
employed
person
receives
housing
as
part
of
his
or
her
work,
the
reasonable
value
of
that
housing
would
be
added
to
the
net
taxable
income
of
the
person
portion
of
california
income
tax
purposes.
would
that
be
a
different
situation
constitutionally
from
what
we
have
here.
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro
could
congress
declare
this
interest
immune
from
taxation,
could
congress
do
it,
what
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
constitution
bars
it
to
the
extent
that
congress
could
not
permit
california
to
tax
it?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
not
the
same
kind
of
prohibitions,
as
one
would
find
in
the
first
amendment,
for
example.
unknown
speaker
who
the
tax
is
levied
on?
unknown
speaker
on
their
employees?
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
only
for
the
part
of
the
property
that
they
use
as
personal
property.
unknown
speaker
but
isn’t
it
true?
unknown
speaker
but
we
certainly
take
historical
fact
resolutions
from
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
don't
we,
even
in
that
situation?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
mean
historical
in
the
sense
of
time
a
memorial,
but
just
determinations
strictly
of
facts
as
opposed
to
law.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
government’s
interest
in
this?
unknown
speaker
on
its
employees.
unknown
speaker
the
government
does
not
pay
a
nickel
of
this,
right?
unknown
speaker
how
are
you
going
to
know
whether
they
would
change
the
rules?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
understand
that
if
a
house
with
four
rooms
and
one
of
them
is
used
as
an
office
and
the
other
three
were
used
as
a
living
room,
a
bathroom
and
a
bedroom.
why
they
could
not
tax
the
three
rooms
and
not
tax
the
fourth
room?
unknown
speaker
i
did
put
that
in
my
last
question,
my
question
was
if
the
three
rooms
were
used
solely
for
personal
reasons
why
that
could
not
be
taxed
as
personal
reasons?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
am
waiting
for?
unknown
speaker
because
it
is
a
24
hour
call?
unknown
speaker
well,
aren’t
you
not
on
24
hour
call?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
aren’t
you
not
on
24
hour
call?
and
you
still
pay
taxes
on
your
home
don't
you?
and
you
do
not
complain,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
do
they
have
a
choice
whether
or
not
to
live
in
the
house?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
distinction
between
those
employees
and
those
who
could
have
a
choice
to
live
elsewhere?
unknown
speaker
all
of
the
employees
pay
something
for
the
house.
unknown
speaker
even
those
who
are
sent
there
have
no
choice
or
option
to
refuse.
unknown
speaker
let
me
understand
this.
they
would
at
least
ask
to
the
forest
service
people,
every
occupant
whether
he
was
one
who
had
the
choice
to
live
somewhere
else
or
not,
every
occupant
in
effect
is
required
to
live
in
one
of
those.
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
computation
of
the
tax.
as
i
understand
it,
the
rental
actually
paid
maybe
less
than
the
real
rental
value
of
the
premises.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
i
do
not
need
that.
i
am
not
so
much
interested
in
how
you
compute
the
rentals,
or
how
you
compute
the
tax.
as
i
understand
it,
the
tax
is
computed
by
capitalizing
the
economic
rental
value
of
the
premises
basically,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
if
that
is
correct,
am
i
also
correct
in
believing
that
the
tax
would
have
been
the
same
whether
the
rent
was
less,
the
same
as
or
greater
than
the
fair
market
value.
unknown
speaker
from
the
city
of
muskegon
case,
the
person
just
had
a
permit
rather
than
a
lease
didn’t
they?
this
court
said
it
was
still
taxed.
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
saying
that
is
a
general
proposition
are
you.
so
broadly
and
to
sweep
the
state
income
tax,
is
it
not.
unknown
speaker
just
in
this
context.
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
identify
that
federal
function
and
indicate
in
what
respect
it
is
impelled
or
hindered
by
this
tax.
unknown
speaker
is
what
way
is
that
handicapped
or
interfered
with
by
the
tax?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
evidence
or
finding
(inaudible)
of
the
operation
of
that?
unknown
speaker
the
federal
function
is
sleeping
and
eating?
unknown
speaker
and
if
they
lived
in
a
private
home,
they
will
pay
all
of
these
taxes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
if
they
were
not
living
on
government
owned
land
but
were
renting
the
equivalent
apartment
on
private-owned
land
at
exactly
the
same
rent
they
would
not
pay
the
tax,
wouldn’t
they?
unknown
speaker
paying
the
same
rent
for
the
same
facilities,
but
that
property
were
located
outside
the
forest
preserve
then
the
man
would
not
pay
any
tax
at
all?
unknown
speaker
but
not
on
the
occupant?
not
on
the
tenant?
unknown
speaker
your
tenant
pays
the
tax
and
no
other
tenant
pays
who
does
not
live
on
federal
properties?
unknown
speaker
but
the
district
court
did,
didn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
maybe
i
misunderstand
the
tax,
but
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
if
the
forester
lived
off
of
government-owned
property
and
had
exactly
the
same
premises,
paid
exactly
the
same
rent,
he
would
not
pay
this
tax?
the
theory
being
that
the
landlord
pays
it.
here
the
landlord
does
not
pay
it
because
the
landlord
is
united
states
government?
unknown
speaker
a
federal
employee
with
the
same
earnings
pays
the
tax
that
a
non-federal
employee
does
not
pay,
if
he
lives
elsewhere.
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
you
said
that
tax
was
on
the
employees,
in
the
question
that
i
asked
you.
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
on
his
interest
in
real
estate.
in
a
possessory
interest
in
a
piece
of
real
estate
--
unknown
speaker
requirement
(ph)
for
another
piece
of
land.
unknown
speaker
is
any
question
raised
here
as
to
the
computation
of
the
amount
of
tax?
unknown
speaker
and
i
take
it
you
are
not
asking
that
any
case
for
all
of
the
michigan
trilogy
be
overruled.
unknown
speaker
well
we
are
(inaudible)
is
that
if
they
are
servants
of
the
united
states
and
taxed
by
them,
taxed
by
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
central
point?
unknown
speaker
when
is
the
tax
imposed?
unknown
speaker
was
it
imposed
in
advance?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
it
imposed
at
the
end
of
the
year
or
during
the
year?
unknown
speaker
so
a
person
with
a
day-to-day
occupancy
pays
the
tax
for
the
entire
year?
unknown
speaker
that
is
why
the
tax
is
such
a
small
amount
for
each
person.
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
so,
if
some
person
is
transferred
in
the
middle
of
the
year,
will
two
different
people
be
tax
by
the
use
of
this
property?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
surely,
i
perhaps
misunderstood
your
answer
to
my
brother
brennan’s
question,
but
a
tax
on
servants
of
the
united
states
is
not
a
tax
on
the
united
states
is
it?
there
are
all
sorts
of
taxes
imposed
upon
government
employees.
unknown
speaker
you
made
a
de
minimis
argument
which
is
what
california
makes
it
here
that
does
so
little
of
the
use
of
these
buildings
as
public
and
governmental
use,
so
much
of
it
is
residential
use,
they
are
entitled
to
tax
you?
unknown
speaker
but
he
did
live
there,
he
had
a
kitchen
and
a
bathroom
and
a
bedroom
and
the
other
rooms
that
my
brother
marshall
described.
there
is
his
residence
and
that
of
his
wife,
because
there
was
a
preference
given
to
married
employees,
isn’t
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
he
pays
rent.
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
like
putting
that
in
a
watchtower
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
your
answer
would
be
the
same
to
this
hypothetical.
the
government
sometimes
increasingly,
decreasingly
so,
allows
employees
who
use
automobiles
to
take
the
automobile
home
at
night
so
that
they
can
be
on
call.
and,
if
the
state
of
california
tried
to
tax
that
use
from,
let
us
say,
6
o'clock
onward,
you
would
say
they
were
taxing
a
federal
instrumentality?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
you
could
lose
this
case
without
depriving
congress
of
power
to
prevent
this
tax,
you
wanted
to.
unknown
speaker
if
we
decided
against
you,
you
think
that
congress
the
next
day
could
say,
well,
the
states
may
no
longer
tax
this
possessory
interest
of
the
employees?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
this
case
would
govern
the
taxation
of
military
personnel
living
on
government
bases?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
the
problem
is,
gives
a
tax
on
that
government
property.
unknown
speaker
you
just
want
to
attack
the
united
states
government
property.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
yes.
unknown
speaker
isn’t
that
what
you
are
after?
unknown
speaker
the
federal
government
had
paid
taxes
on
this
property,
you
would
not
bother
to
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
waterman,
if
they
take
your
example
of
one
just
off
the
reservation,
one
on
the
reservation,
they
both
pay
a
$100
a
month
rent.
so,
you
say
the
man
who
is
living
in
the
privately
owned
home
in
effect
is
paying
tax
because
he
reimburses
the
landlord
for
his
tax.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
isn’t
the
same
true
as
to
the
man
on
the
reservation?
unknown
speaker
because
the
government
has
given
some
taxation.
unknown
speaker
but
both
tenants
have
exactly
the
same
economic
burden.
unknown
speaker
so
he
will
pay
like
a
$105
and
the
man
who
lives
in
private
property
will
pay
$100?
unknown
speaker
simply
because
he
lives
on
government
property.
unknown
speaker
but
counsel,
how
does
the
constitutional
issue
become
any
difference
simply
because
california
has
not
elected
to
try
to
impose
the
tax
on
exclusive
federal
property?
if
your
theory
is
right,
you
would
have
the
power
to
do
so,
i
would
think?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
no
--
i
mean
assume
congress
has
not
done
anything
one
way
or
the
other.
would
your
theory
not
permit
you
to
tax
the
occupancy
of
barracks
on
a
military
reservation?
unknown
speaker
it
would
not
under
your
existing
regulations.
but
it
would
if
you
intend
to
--
but
constitutionally
you
could
amend
the
regulations
and
do
so
if
you
are
right,
but?
unknown
speaker
but
is
there
any
reason
--
any
constitutional
reason
if
you
are
correct,
why
you
could
not
do
so?
unknown
speaker
what
if
were
not
for
the
federal
enclave
the
bill
would
go
to
the
federal
government,
wouldn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
i
said
if
it
were
not
for
the
federal
enclave
point.
the
bill
then
would
go
to
the
owner
of
the
building,
right?
the
landlord.
unknown
speaker
if
the
building
was
outside
of
the
enclave
and
was
owned
by
mr.
us,
mr.
us
would
pay
the
tax?
unknown
speaker
i
said
mr.
us,
i
did
not
say
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
that
is
right.
but
if
it
was
owned
by
the
united
states,
then
you
would
tax
the
tenant.
unknown
speaker
but
you
really
are
shooting
for
the
landlord.
unknown
speaker
can
fresno
county
raise
a
considerable
sum
from
this
possessory
tax?
unknown
speaker
approximately,
how
much?
unknown
speaker
aggregate
a
$170.00.
unknown
speaker
and
how
about
the
possessory
interest
tax
generally,
well
it
just
applies
to
this
kind
of
housing,
doesn’t
it?
otherwise,
it
is
a
tax
imposed
on
the
landlord,
correct?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
the
issue
is
the
same
--
the
constitutional
issue
is
the
same
with
respect
to
your
taxing
commercial
enterprises,
who
lease
from
the
federal
government
as
it
is
here?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
possessory
interest
tax,
interest
tax
on
those
enterprises?
unknown
speaker
does
that
raise
a
good
deal
of
money
for
the
county?
unknown
speaker
if
you
think
you
could
loose
this
case
and
still
sustain
or
maintain
your
right
to
tax
or
a
commercial
enterprise.
unknown
speaker
mr.
waterman,
could
i
ask
you
two
very
brief
questions?
is
this
tax
unique
to
california,
this
possessory
interest
tax?
unknown
speaker
the
other
question
i
had
-
does
it
--
does
the
imposition
of
the
tax
depend
on
the
character
of
the
possessory
interest
now
there
had
not
been
a
lease
arrangement
but
rather
and
some
kind
of
a
license
gesture,
like
you
are
going
to
a
hotel
room
or
something
like
that,
would
that
be
enough
to
impose
it?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dietrich?
unknown
speaker
what
services
other
than
the
public
schools
are
provided
to
these
residents
by
the
county?
unknown
speaker
do
they
have
any
fire
protection
or
police
protection
from
the
county?
unknown
speaker
does
the
county
sheriff
have
any
jurisdiction
within
the
fire
--
unknown
speaker
how
many
people
in
the
ranger
service
are
on
welfare?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
didn’t
you
say
so?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
mind
if
that
doesn’t
persuade
me
anyway.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dietrich,
i
did
not
quite
follow
you.
just
before
we
started
questioning,
you
said
that
those
who
live
on
the
enclave
would
get
a
better
deal
than
those
who
lived
off.
i
though
it
would
be
just
the
reverse.
because
if
they
both
pay
the
fair
rental
value
of
the
property,
the
one
on
the
--
the
forester
would
also
pay
the
tax
the
other
one
would
not?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
proposition
that
what
you
are
really
doing,
is
since
you
cannot
collect
the
money
from
the
owner,
the
landlord,
you
collect
it
from
the
tenant?
unknown
speaker
and
so
you
are
collecting
it
from
the
tenant.
unknown
speaker
from
the
tenant.
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
really
aimed
at
the
landlord.
unknown
speaker
now
what
is
the
other
one,
what
is
the
(inaudible)
long
tax?
unknown
speaker
is
that
aimed
at
the
tenant?
unknown
speaker
that’s
right,
but
you
really
want
to
collect
that
long
tax
on
government
property.
unknown
speaker
that’s
right,
but
you
want
it
at
the
long
property
owned
by
the
federal
government.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dietrich,
you
identified
the
services
that
this
people
get.
are
there
other
taxes
that
the
county
imposes
that
these
people
pay?
unknown
speaker
gasoline
tax.
unknown
speaker
cigarette
tax.
unknown
speaker
liquor
tax,
you
name
it.
unknown
speaker
i
was
one
question
though,
in
describing
property,
just
the
ordinary
property
outside
the
forest,
the
federal
forest
are,
you
do
not
worry
about
putting
a
use
tax
on
him
because
you
have
collected
real
estate
tax
on
the
house.
unknown
speaker
so
that
in
that
sense,
justice
marshall’s
suggestion
would
appear
to
be
that
this
is
a
substitute
for
that
tax.
unknown
speaker
or
it
could
in
other
ways
be
an
indirect
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
mr.
shupiro,
if
you
have
--
would
you
suggest
what
you
think
about
the
exclusive
enclave?
unknown
speaker
i
gather,
we
have
been
told
that
at
least
fresno’s
regulations
do
not
apply
to
this
tax.
let
us
say
the
military,
living
in
housing
on
the
exclusive
enclave,
but
he
does
say
that
constitutionally
he
thinks
it
can
be
done.
unknown
speaker
of
course
if
you
were
--
if
the
military
base
were
involved
you
would
be
arguing
that
the
states
have
absolutely
no
jurisdiction
inside
the
borders
of
the
land?
