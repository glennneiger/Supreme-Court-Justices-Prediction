mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
here
on
direct
appeal
by
the
united
states
and
individual
forest
service
employees,
from
two
decisions
of
the
california
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
district.
the
sole
question
is
whether
a
california
tax
on
possessory
interests
in
improvements
on
tax-exempt
land
may
constitutionally
be
applied
to
the
occupancy
of
government
owned
housing
by
employees
of
the
united
states
forest
service.
the
amounts
involved
in
these
tax
assessments
are
relatively
small.
the
principal
could
be
quite
far
reaching
in
view
of
the
extensive
amount
of
housing
which
is
supplied
by
the
united
states
to
employees
not
only
of
the
forest
service
but
also
of
various
branches
of
the
department
of
interior
and
most
importantly
of
the
military.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
it
would
your
honor.
in
these
cases
the
housing
is
not
supplied
free
of
charge.
the
employee
occupies
the
housing
although
as
a
tenant
at
will.
he
pays
compensation
for
it
which
is
deducted
from
his
salary.
now
he
does
not
pay
in
advance
for
the
housing,
he
pays
for
the
housing
he
has
occupied
each
two
week
period.
so
this
is
not
in
any
sense
compensation
to
the
employee.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
we
believe
that
congress
could.
it
has
not
done
so,
because
of
the
tax
as
we
view
it
falls
directly
on
in
an
incident
of
the
employment
of
a
federal
employee,
and
hence
a
tax
on
the
federal
function
itself.
the
constitution
therefore
bars
the
imposition
of
the
tax
under
the
doctrine
of
m'culloch
v.
maryland.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
believe
congress
can
wave
the
immunity
of
m'culloch
v.
maryland,
and
i
think
it
has,
in
some
instances
done
so.
for
example,
with
respect
to
national
banks,
there
is
some
limited
taxation
of
national
banks.
on
the
other
hand,
that
statute
which
permits
national
bank
taxation
is
quite
limited
as
this
court
held
in
the
first
agricultural
credit
a
few
terms
back.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
it
is
within
the
reach
of
congress.
but,
congress
has
given
us
some
indication
that
it
does
not
intend
generally
to
wave
the
immunity
of
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states.
in
a
somewhat
analogous
area,
the
buck
act
of
1942
subjects
or
rather
provides
that
certain
state
sales
and
use
taxes
maybe
imposed
in
exclusive
federal
enclaves.
and
the
exclusivity
of
those
federal
enclaves
is
not
bar
to
the
imposition
of
that
kind
of
a
tax.
however,
the
same
statute
in
section
107
says,
“this
statute
does
not
consent
to
the
imposition
of
state
taxes
on
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states
or
the
property
of
the
united
states”.
and
it
is
really
that
which
is
our
position
here,
that
here
we
are
dealing
with
a
tax
on
a
federal
function.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
tax
your
honor
is
levied
on
the
possessory
interest
that
forest
service
employees
have
in
government
supplied
housing
for
which
they
pay
…
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
on
the
government
employees.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
the
claim.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
that
is
what
this
states
have
contended.
now
our
answer
to
that,
now
that
is
what
the
counties
have
contended,
our
answer
to
that
is
the
possessory
interest
of
the
employee
on
the
residential
side
cannot
be
in
fact
separated
from
the
governmental
use
of
this
property
and
this
is
reflected
we
think
in
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
which
reviewed
the
assessments
involved.
the
two
trial
courts
here
in
fresno
county
and
in
tuolumne
county,
found
that
because
of
the
inter-relationship
between
the
residential
and
governmental
aspects
of
the
employees
use
and
occupancy
of
this
property,
they
had
no
possessory
interest
within
the
meaning
of
california
law.
now
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
reversed
that
as
a
matter
of
california
law
but
of
course
we
are
dealing
with
the
impact
on
a
federal
interest
of
the
state
tax.
and
so
the
question
of
what
that
impact
is,
is
not
determined
by
the
state
court’s
decision.
this
is
a
question
of
federal
law
that
has
to
be
resolved.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
this
is
not
really
a
very
historical
determination.
the
real
basis
for
the
imposition
of
this
tax
was
a
california
court
decision
in
1967,
caldwell
&
klein
against
the
camp
(ph).
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
well,
the
basic
facts
are
not
disputed
here.
the
conclusion
from
the
facts
which
the
court
of
appeals
drew
is,
namely,
whether
this
possessory
interest
for
purposes
of
determining
impact
of
the
tax
on
the
federal
function.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
government’s
interest
here
is
preventing
the
imposition
of
a
tax
on
an
incident
of
federal
employment.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
when
i
say..
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no
your
honor,
but
that
has
not
been
the
test
in
this
court’s
decision.
if
in
fact
..
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
i
think
we
are
staying
within
them,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
the
county
of
fresno
purported
to
do
that.
now
they
purported
in
making
their
valuation
here
to
exclude
from
the
valuation,
from
the
assessment,
the
office
functions,
if
i
may
use
that
term,
and
the
public
areas
surrounding
the
house.
the
county
of
tuolumne
did
not
make
that
kind
of
distinction.
they
did
not
exclude
the
office
and
public
areas.
they
simply
limited
the
assessment
on
the
basis
of
the
term
of
occupancy.
but,
i
was
about
to
tell
your
honor
that
the
fact
that
the
united
states
does
not
pay
this
tax
out
of
its
pocket
is
not
the
test
--
this
court’s
decision
have
clearly
indicated
that
if
…
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
as
i
shall
demonstrate
when
i
go
in
to
the
facts
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
occupancy
of
the
house
is
really
not
conveniently
divisible
into
office
and
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
is
partly
a
24
hour
call,
it
is
partly…
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
do
not
live
in
government
housing,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
not
in
this
court,
your
honor.
i
think,
i
can
illuminate
my
argument
a
little
better
by
going
into
what
facts
the
two
trial
courts
found,
and
these
basic
facts
have
not
been
challenged.
the
courts
really
found
that
the
employees
do
not
occupy
the
housing
as
private
citizens
or
use
it
for
their
own
profit.
they
occupied
as
employees
of
the
united
states,
and
their
right
to
occupy
this
housing
is
to
serve
the
needs
of
the
forest
service.
the
trial
courts
found
that
they
did
not
have..
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
some
employees
do
and
some
do
not.
certain
employees
who
are
required
to
look
after
special
equipment,
who
are
on
fire
control
duty
or
who
serve
the
public
during
certain
seasons
must
live
in
the
government
supplied
house.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
but
there
is
a
reason,
there
is
a
permissive
category,
however,
the
forest
service
requires
that
all
of
its
housing
be
occupied
in
order
to
have
people
on
the
forest
grounds,
so
that
it
will
assign
employees
to
that
housing.
now
employees
of
certain
categories
can
refuse,
but
someone
is
going
to
be
assigned
to
occupy
that
housing.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
all
pay,
all
are
required.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
correct.
they
all
pay
for
the
right
to
use
the
house.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
in
effect,
he
is
required
to
live
in
and
that
brings
us
to
the
burdens
of
occupancy,
which
are
common
to
all
of
the
employees
who
live
in
the
houses,
whether
the
houses
are
required
occupancy
in
the
technical
sense
or
permissive
occupancy,
in
a
sense
they
are
all
required
to
live
in
them.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
the
formula
for
determining
the
rental
actually
paid
is
supposed
to
be
on
a
comparable
basis,
comparable
to
the
nearest
established
community.
then
this
is
reduced
by
two
factors.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
how
the…
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
should
point
out
that
the
county
of
fresno
made
an
express
effort
to
reduce
the
tax
for
this
office
function,
the
county
of
tuolumne
did
not.
going
in
to
the
nature
of
this
occupancy,
the
first
point
is
that
the
employees
have
no
fixed
right
of
occupancy
or
any
lease
or
term
of
possession.
their
possession
can
be
terminated
temporarily
or
permanently
at
any
time
the
needs
of
the
service
require
this
--their
right
of
privacy
is
sharply
diminished.
forest
service
personnel
and
forest
service
business
can
enter
the
houses
at
any
time,
in
fact
it
is
common
key
system.
the
district
ranger,
for
example,
can
walk
into
a
house
to
inspect
it.
the
district
fire
control
officer
can
walk
in
to
it,
if
it
has
a
radio
that
is
indented
to
be
on
24
hour
monitor
service.
the
result
is
that
the
employee
has
neither
a
full
right
of
privacy,
as
someone
in
private
housing
would
have,
his
housing
is
solely
for
government
purposes,
the
occupant
has
no
right
to
a
fix
term.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
muskegon,
i
think
illustrates
the
distinction
we
are
making
here.
in
muskegon,
someone
had
a
right
--
a
private
party
had
a
right
to
use
government
property
in
the
conduct
of
a
commercial
business.
and
in
the
muskegon
case,
the
court
expressly
reserved
the
question
of
what
would
happen
if
you
are
dealing
with
a
servant
or
an
agent
of
the
government.
now,
where
the
legal
incident
falls
on
a
servant
or
agents
of
the
government,
the
court
has
held
that
the
tax
is
unconstitutional.
that
is
illustrated
in
the
kern-limerick,
inc.
v.
scurlock.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
no
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
in
this
context.
i
say
that
the
legal
incidents
falls
on
the
federal
function,
i
am
talking
about
the
--
i
mean
a
federal
function
not
on
someone
who
is
a
federal
employee.
for
example,
the
courts
long
passed
the
taxability
of..
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
federal
function,
your
honor,
here
is
the
federal
function
for
which
occupancy
of
the
housing
is
made
available.
the
guardianship
of
the
national
forest
and
the
service
to
the
public
within
the
national
forest.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
the
tax
can
only
have
a
relatively
remote
effect,
in
this
case,
on
the
carrying
out
of
that
function.
we
have
argued
below
that
it
affected
employee
morale
that
it
could
lead
to
resistance
to
assignments
because
of
the
imposition
of
the
tax,
since
one
would
have
to
accept
this
less
convenient
housing.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no
there
is
not,
your
honor.
in
our
major
contention,
there
is
not
such
evidence
on
that.
our
major
contention
does
not
turn
on
that.
our
real
argument
on
that
aspect
of
the
case
is
that
if
the
tax,
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax,
is
in
fact
on
the
federal
function,
then
the
court
does
not
inquire
as
to
whether
there
is
any
additional
burden
or
interference.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
part
of
it
indeed,
is
your
honor.
in
order
to
keep
this
people
on
those
premises
for
the
period
of
time,
it
is
necessary.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
and
they
would
have
the
greater
right
of
privacy
which
is
attempted
on
the
occupation
of
private
(inaudible).
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
if
they
were
renting?
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
renter
would
not
as
this
tax
is
drawn.
i
think,
there
would
of
course
be
a
property
tax
on
the
land
owner.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
on
the
rented
property,
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
my
understanding.
now,
we
have
not
claimed
here
that
there
is
discrimination.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
district
court
found
the
discrimination.
we
have
found
that
the
discrimination
we
claimed
aroused
from
the
discrimination
between
the
treatment
of
state
foresters
and
federal
foresters.
we
found
that
that
discrimination
did
not
exist,
so
we
withdrew
our
discrimination
claim
in
this
respect.
our
brief
expressly
withdrew
it.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
believe
that
is
how
the
tax
is
drawn.
now
before
i
…
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
of
course
what
we
focused
on
in
this
case
was
the
imposition
of
the
tax
as
it
is
drawn,
a
tax
on
a
possessory
interest
in
tax
exempt
land.
that
is
the
only
kind
of
tax,
we
have
been
dealing
with.
we
did
not
compare
it
to
a
tax
on
occupancy
of
non-tax
exempt
land.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
it
is
on
the
possessory
interest
of
the
employee
and
the
housing
he
occupies.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
possessory
interest
on
the
improvement.
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
the
tax
lies
on
the
possessory
interest
of
the
employee’s
occupation
of
the
tax
exempt
land.
that
is
all
we
address
are
challenged
to.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
the
valuation
is
not
an
issue
here,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no
your
honor.
we
distinguish
the
michigan
trilogy
on
the
ground
that
in
those
cases
we
were
dealing
with
the
use
by
private
parties
in
commercial
businesses
of
government
property,
either
that
had
been
leased
to
them
or
given
to
them
under
a
permit.
in
this
case,
we
are
dealing
with
the
imposition
of
a
tax
on
a
government
employee
for
his
possession
and
occupancy
of
government
housing
for
a
government
purpose.
in
short,
we
view
that
as
a
tax
on
a
servant
of
the
government
for
an
incident
of
his
employment.
we
compare
the
case
to
kern-limerick,
inc.
v.
scurlock,
where
a
contractor
using,
acquiring
government
property
was
treated
as
an
agent
because
those
were
the
terms
of
his
contract.
he
was
acting
as
an
agent
of
the
government.
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
fell
on
him
and
as
a
result,
this
court
held
in
kern-limerick,
inc.
v.
scurlock
that
the
tax
could
not
be
sustained.
even
though
the
economic
burden
in
that
case
of
the
tax
was
the
same
as
an
earlier
case,
alabama
v.
king
&
boozer
in
which
a
contractor
was
similarly
using
government
property
but
was
not
an
agent
of
the
united
states.
and
that
is
why
our
central
point
here
is
that
the
employee’s
occupation
of
the
government
owned
housing
here
is
factually
inseparable
from
their
duties
as
employees
of
the
united
states.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
our
central
point.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
this
tax
was
first
imposed
in
1967.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
in
advance
of?
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
this
tax
was
imposed
during
the
year.
i
think
it
is
an
annual
tax
and
it
is
intended
to
be
imposed.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
tax
is
reduced
by
its
actual
occupancy,
as
my
understanding,
it
is
measured
by
its
actual
occupancy.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
in
computing
it,
in
fact,
our
findings
of
fact
here
show
that
these
houses
tend
to
be
occupied
three
to
four
years
at
a
time,
and
this
was
taken
into
account
in
the
valuation
process
by
the
counties.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
assume
that
would
be
--
how
it
would
be
applied.
now
we
have
been
litigating
the
tax
since
it
was
--
it’s
a
relatively
new
innovation,
this
is
the
first
case
under
it.
it
was
imposed
in
1967.
this
is
the
1967
tax
we
are
litigating.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
i
only
meant
servants
of
employees
being
taxed
for
an
incident
of
their
employment,
not
their
compensation
or
not
any
other
aspect
of
their
lives,
except
so
much
of
the
taxes
falls
on
their
government
functions,
if
as
we
contend
here,
the
occupancy
of
the
housing
is
inseparable
from
the
government
duties
of
the
employees,
and
we
think
it
is,
then
there
is
just
no
basis
for
trying
to
distinguish
them
constitutionally
and
therefore
it
is
a
tax
on
employees
as
an
incident
of
their
federal
employment.
that
can
not
be
done.
if,
for
example,
the
county
have
not
attempted
to
do
this,
imposed
a
possessory
interest
tax
on
government
employees
working
in
government
offices
saying,
“well,
5%
of
the
time
you
are
doing
personal
business
on
government
time,
we
will
tax
you
for
that
5%.”
we
would
argue
that
that
is
just
inextricable
from
their
government
functions
and
hence
is
a
tax
on
the
government
employee
for
an
incident
of
his
government
employment.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
this
goes
to
something
that
the
court
of
appeals
attempted
to
do
here.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
court
because
they
said
that
while
government
business
was
sometimes
conducted
from
the
unit,
the
business
was
completely
incidental
to
the
main
use
of
the
property.
so
it
made
the
test
of
taxability
turn
on
whether
the
government
or
the
residential
interest
was
dominant.
now
we
submit
that
this
is
not
a
proper
standard
for
determining
the
constitutionality
of
state
taxation
of
federal
interest,
that
it
leads
to
a
great
deal
of
confusion
because
you
have
to
try
and
measure
which
is
dominant
when
the
employee
is
in
the
house
24
hours.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
there
is
a
residential
interest
without
doubt,
and
we
do
not
deny
that.
our
argument
is
that
that
residential
interest
exists
solely
for
the
purposes
of
the
government.
he
is
in
the
house
to
serve
a
government
purpose.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
he
pays
rent
to
use
the
house.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
the
watchtower
would
be
a
workplace
and
the
county
does
not
purport
to
tax
the
workplaces.
but
this
also
was
a
workplace,
as
the
findings
of
the
trial
court,
in
fact
the
findings
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
agreed
with
that
aspect
of
it,
reflect
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
because
i
would
assume
that
the
availability
of
the
automobile
in
the
evening
would
have
to
be
justified
for
government
purpose.
so
really
the
heart
of
our
contention
is
that
the
residential
and
the
governmental
functions
of
occupancy
of
this
housing
are
inextricably
interrelated.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
congress,
i
think
can
always
speak
directly
to
the
questions
in
m'culloch
either
way.
they
can
wave
the
m'culloch
immunity
or
they
could
probably
broaden
their
indications
in
the
courts
decision.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
they
could,
but
to
use
this
as
a
standard
of
constitutional
adjudication
would
mean
that
the
congress
would
have
to
stay
one
step
ahead
of
the
state
tax
laws
in
every
one
of
the
jurisdictions.
keeping
an
eye
out
to
see
what
new
federal
interest
is
subject
to
tax?
now,
congress
instead
has
done
the
other
way,
as
the
buck
act
indicates,
they
have
said,
well,
we
will
start
with
m'culloch
and
maryland
which
bars
state
taxation
of
federal
instrumentalities
and
federal
functions.
and
then
we
will
decide
when
we
want
to
wave
it,
that
has
been
the
approach
and
that
is
what
the
buck
act
strongly
reflects.
in
fact,
that
was
the
basis
of
the
courts
decision
in
the
mississippi
liquor
case.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
we
believe
that
it
could,
i
hesitate
to
go
into
that
because
our
record
does
not
develop
the
facts.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
but
the
reason
we
are
here
in
large
part
is
because
of
our
concern
that
this
kind
of
possessory
interest
tax
will
be
extended
to
the
military,
which
is
the
biggest
body
of
government
supplied
housing.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
that
time.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
mr.
waterman?
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
we
are
informed
by
the
department
of
the
navy
that
humboldt
county
in
california
is
attempting
to
tax
navy
housing,
so
that
the
potential
for
the
imposition
of
this
tax
on
the
military
exists
now.
with
respect
to
this
specific
case,
i
should
point
out
that
16
u.
s.
c.
480
provides
that
state
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
continued
to
apply
in
national
forest
areas,
so
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
an
exclusive
federal
enclave
when
we
talk
about
national
forest.
however,
16
u.
s.
c.
480
is
not
a
waiver
of
this
immunity
of
the
united
states,
its
instrumentalities,
or
its
officers
in
connection
with
their
duties
from
the
imposition
of
state
taxes.
now
there
is
second
major
point
i
would
like
to
make.
the
counties
claim
they
are
simply
seeking
to
make
up
revenues
lost,
because
national
forests
are
not
taxable
since
it
is
united
states
property.
16
u.s.
code
section
500
provides
that
the
counties
shall
receive
25%
of
the
receipts
from
the
national
forests
located
in
their
jurisdiction
to
be
applied
for
roads
and
schools.
so
congress
has
enacted
a
kind
of
in
lieu
tax,
because
the
national
forests
are
not
themselves
directly
taxable.
now
there
is
one
other
point,
because
the
tax
is
on
a
federal
function
in
our
view,
there
is
no
requirement
that
a
burden
or
interference
of
any
other
kind
be
shown
and
that
the
tax
has
been
imposed.
this
court
has
held
that
national
banks
are
not
taxable
by
states
except
to
the
extent
there
has
been
a
waiver,
even
though
there
is
no
burden
on
the
united
states.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
would
be
our
contention
on
any
exclusive
military
enclave.
now
there
are
military
bases
which
are
like
national
forests
in
the
sense
that
the
federal
government
hasn’t
seeded
all
civil
and
military
dues
--
or
has
not
taken
back
all
civil
and
military
jurisdiction.
in
those
again,
we
would
argue
that
the
tax
is
like
a
tax
on
the
post
exchange
or
military
officer’s
club
involved
in
the
mississippi
liquor
case.
we
would
say
it
is
still
falling
on
a
federal
instrumentality
or
a
federal
function
and
once
we
established
that
then
that
is
the
end
of
any
demonstration,
any
need
to
demonstrate
burden.
there
is
no
great
burden
on
the
united
states
if
military
personnel
pay
a
tax
on
their
liquor.
but
the
court
has
held
that
that
is
nonetheless
unconstitutional.
the
same
is
true
for
national
banks
or
the
red
cross
for
example.
thank
you
your
honors.
