mr.
james
b.
waterman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
james
b.
waterman,
deputy
county
council
for
the
county
of
fresno,
california,
and
one
of
the
appellees
in
this
matter.
i
would
like
to
take
a
few
minutes
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
that
were
asked
at
mr.
shapiro,
i
guess,
i
am
little
more
familiar
with
the
taxing
situation
in
california.
there
was
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
an
employee
who
resided
in
a
private
home
or
who
rented
a
private
home
outside
of
the
forest
would
pay
tax.
and
the
answer
to
that
is
you
would
pay
tax
but
not
directly.
anytime
a
person
who
owns
a
private
property
and
leases
it,
they
try
to
recover,
of
course,
all
that
cost.
the
tax
is
assessed
to
the
owner
of
the
real
property.
and
as
a
part
of
that
income,
the
tax
that
the
lessor
would
pay,
would
be
included
in
the
rental
amount
and
i
think
that
is
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
yes
sir,
because
the
government
property
itself
is
exempted,
there
is
no
questions.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
no
sir.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
no,
if
i
said
that
i
misstated
it.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
no
sir,
we
want
to
equalize
the
obligation
of
people.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
federal
government..
mr.
james
b.
waterman
yes
sir,
the
federal
government
in
effect;
this
was
not
brought
out
but
there
was
a
finding
that
and
there
is
a
regulation
that
the
federal
government
where
they
do
not
have
governmental
housing
sufficient
to
staff
their
people
in
the
national
forest,
they
do
have
the
option
to
go
outside
and
rent
private
housing
at
the
prevailing
rates,
and
thereby
put
their
employee
into
that
house.
the
employee
does
not
thereupon
pay
the
same
rate.
he
pays
the
rate
that
is
determined
by
the
rental
survey
and
all
of
the
things
that
mr.
shapiro
mentioned
concerning
accessibility
and
amenities
in
this
sort
of
thing.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
yes
sir.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
because
that’s
taxation
for
possessory
interest
in
california.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
that
is
correct.
because
the
government
does
not
pay
the
tax.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
right,
and
if
this
tax
is
upheld
,
he
government
employee
will
pay
his
fare
share
of
tax
whereby
he
does
not
now.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
that
is
correct,
but
it
is
build
into
the
..
mr.
james
b.
waterman
that
is
correct.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
the
m'culloch
v.
maryland
argument
in
california
possession
of
tax
exempt
property
for
your
own
personal
beneficial
use
is
a
form
of
property
and
is
so
defined
by
the
california
statutes.
m'culloch
v.
maryland
prohibited
only
a
state
tax
against
an
operation
or
function
or
an
activity
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wish
to
deal,
this
morning,
with
title
xvi
of
the
united
states
code
section
480,
in
which
congress
did
express
its
intention
that
there
should
be
a
dual
jurisdiction
in
the
national
forest
between
the
federal
government
and
so
far
as
the
crimes
against
the
united
states
are
concerned,
which
were
left
to
the
united
states.
and
reserving
to
the
state
wherein
the
national
forest
is
located
its
jurisdiction
and
it
did
not
deprive
the
inhabitants
thereof
of
their
rights
and
privileges
as
citizens,
or
be
absolved
from
their
duties
as
citizens
of
the
state.
now
our
contention
is
that
one
of
those
duties
is
the
payment
of
the
local
ad
valorem
real
property
tax,
and
as
has
been
expressed,
since
we
are
talking
about
property
that
is
in
the
public
domain
and
tax
exempt.
the
only
means
by
which
such
a
tax
can
be
paid
is
to
through
the
possessory
interest
tax,
in
other
words,
the
tax
on
the
beneficial
use
and
occupation
of
tax-exempt
property.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
i
believe,
i
think
it
is
johnson
v.
yosemite
were
that
specifically
was
excluded,
you
are
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
however,
the
state
of
california
does
levy
a
sales-tax
on
retail
sales
in
the
national
forest
areas.
so,
that
has
not
been
precluded.
however,
we
are
mainly
talking
about
an
increment
of
local
property
tax
which
benefits
those
inhabitants
and
i
am
speaking
specifically
now
to
the
increment
that
goes
to
the
local
school
district
tax;
that
is
based
in
california
primarily
on
the
local
real
property
tax.
now,
there
was
some
testimony
or
a
statement
yesterday
that
some
of
these
people
have
resided
in
these
government
homes
in
the
national
forest
for
two
or
three
years.
there
is
evidence
in
this
record,
that
in
one
case,
an
employee
had
been
on
the
same
single-family
residence
for
fifteen
years.
now
during
that
period
and
of
course
this
would
be
prior
to
1968
when
we
started
imposing
this
tax.
in
effect,
he
would
have
paid
no
increment,
whatsoever,
to
the
local
school
tax.
if
he
had
a
six-year-old
child
when
he
moved
into
that
home,
that
child
would
have
gone
through
the
local
school
district
to
the
elementary
schools,
the
high
school,
and
two
years
of
the
community
college
if
that
were
the
case,
being
a
hypothetical
situation.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
no
sir,
i
don’t
--
in
a
public.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
the
public
school
system
of
california
provides
for
no-direct
payment
for
non-residents.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
i
would
think
not
your
honor,
i
think
--
obviously,
they
are
citizens
of
the
united
states,
they
are
citizens
of
the
state,
i
think
that
they
could
not.
i
think
it
would
be
a
denial
of
equal
protection
if
they
tried
to
impose
that
type
of
thing.
now
it
is
different
on
a
higher
level
of
education,
of
course,
universities
do
charge
an
out-of-state.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
no
sir;
it
is
not
allowed
in
california,
by
regulation.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
well,
to
my
knowledge
we
do
not
apply
it
to
ministers
even
though
they
might
be
residing
in
a
mansion
(ph)
on
tax-exempt
property.
however,
for
every
tax-exempt
special
district
such
as
irrigation
districts,
core
of
engineers,
i
might
just
give
the
court
a
couple
instances
as
to
how
this
case
is
going
to
effect
other
possessory
--
mr.
james
b.
waterman
county
property,
let
me
give
you
that
for
instance,
if
i
may.
we
charge
a
possessory
interest
tax
to
our
road
supervisors
in
the
county
of
fresno
who
reside
in
county-owned
residence.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
yes
sir,
they
pay
rent
and
possessory
interest
tax.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
well,
we
do
not
have
a
county
if
they
pay
a
state
income
tax.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
where
there
is
a
state
forest,
we
do
not
have
any
in
fresno
county,
but
they
also,
and
this
was
one
of
the
original
intentions
in
this
case
was
that
there
was
discrimination
because
the
state
did
not
charge
its
own
employees
of
possessory
interest
tax
that
is
not
true.
and
it
is
charged,
they
pay
it
on
the
same
basis
that
we
have
been
asking
the
federal
employees
to
pay
it.
so,
it
is
a
non-discriminatory
from
that
standpoint.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
i
believe
it
does
justice
brennan,
after
all,
the
california
regulations
--
we
would
have
to
change
our
regulations,
and
i
think
if
we
did
that
--
to
me
congress
has
expressed
the
intention
to
be
the
exclusive
taxing,
if
there
is
to
be
any
tax
in
an
inclusive
military
enclave.
now,
i
just
don't
foresee
the
state
of
california
ever
trying
to
tax
any
military
in
that
situation.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
no,
i
think
the
question
was
asked
yesterday
whether
congress
would
have
the
power
to
exempt
this
type
of
property.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
not
under
the
existing
definition
of
possessory
interest,
your
honor
and
i
--
mr.
james
b.
waterman
we
would
have
to
amend
our
definition
of
possessory
interest
also.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
no,
i
am
sure
we
could.
i
am
sure
we
would
be
right
back
in
court
if
we
did
though
your
honor.
i
think
as
far
as
in
the
case
law,
and
we
have
foresighted
the
michigan
cases
as
authority
for
the
imposition
of
this
tax.
we
believe
that
graves
v.
new
york,
which
allowed
the
state
income
taxation
of
federal
employees
to
be
the
closest
and
i
could
read
the
language
from
the
--
there
has
been
a
claim
here
that
somehow
this
tax
burdens
the
federal
government.
one,
we
do
not
admit
that
these
employees
in
their
private
housing
which
is
furnished
by
the
government
for
which
they
pay
a
rent.
we
do
not
believe
that
they
are
an
instrumentality
of
the
federal
government
for
that
purpose
and
therefore,
the
tax
is
permissible.
however,
the
government
who
is
also
a
party,
plaintiff
in
this
matter,
alleged
that
there
was
a
burden
against
the
united
states
by
reason
of
the
imposition
and
collection
of
this
tax.
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
in
the
trials
for
these
matters
of
any
burden
whatsoever.
the
government
does
not
get
the
tax
bill,
the
government
is
not
assessed,
the
tax
bill
goes
to
the
individual
employee,
and
aside
from
1967
to
my
--
it’s
my
understanding
that
these
tax
bills
have
been
paid
to
the
county
without
protest
since
that
time.
i
could
be
on
err
on
that
--
mr.
james
b.
waterman
no,
i
do
not
think
we
have
any
right
to
pay,
to
bill
the
federal
government
for
tax.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
no
you
honor,
we
are
taxing
the
person
in
possession
in
this
situation
and
taxing
their
property.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
we
would
not
asses
that
property
for
it
is
owned
by
the
united
states.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
oh,
i
am
sorry,
i
thought
you
are
referring
to
the
united
states
as
an
individual.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
that’s
in
--
we
do
not
divide
the
imposition
or
the
tax
in
california
other
than
in
the
tax-exempt
property
situation.
the
real
property
itself
is
security
for
the
real
property
tax
in
california,
and
there
is
not
a
separate
assessment
to
a
private
lessee
from
a
private
lessor,
this
is
correct.
i
started
to
mention
that
we
do
have
other
federal
land
within
the
county
of
fresno
in
which
we
are
enclosing
this
possessory
interest
tax.
we
do
have
a
rather
substantial
veterans
hospital
there,
which
has
private
--
well
they
are
single-family
residences
for
several
doctors
and
the
administrator.
they
are
very
nice,
high-valued
homes.
if
we
are
concerned,
and
if
this
court
does
not
uphold
the
district
court
of
appeal,
they
will
feel
that
they
no
longer
have
to
pay
a
possessory
interest
tax
and
i
think
that
would
be
the
effect
of
such
a
decision.
core
of
engineers
also
has
a
facility
in
fresno
county
(inaudible)
flat
were
they
built
a
rather
nice
den.
they
maintain
--
maintenance
people
there
in
private,
like
private
homes
but
on
a
federal
property.
we
charge
--
mr.
james
b.
waterman
in
dollar
wise,
no
your
honor,
it
does
not.
i
cannot
give
you
an
absolute
figure,
but
it
is
not
substantial
amount
of
money,
i
would
have
to
admit
that.
however
the
--
mr.
james
b.
waterman
at
the
time
in
1968,
i
think
the
total
amount
at
issue
here
is
$178.00
for
seventeen
individual
plaintiff
owners,
or
residences,
yes.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
that
is
correct,
but
that
was
based
upon
a
one-year
tenancy
at
that
time,
and
we
are
now
--
because
of
the
experience
that
we
have
had,
we
are
now
imposing
a
longer
period
to
capitalize
the
income.
so
it
is
more,
but
i
cannot
give
you
an
exact
figure,
sorry.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
do
have
some
figures
as
to
1976
values
in
the
forest
land.
now,
we
tax
other,
you
know,
private
business
enterprises
who
lease
from
the
federal
government.
the
tax
yield
in
dollars
in
1975
was
$89,622.00.
we
have
a
tax
rate
of
$7.35
per
$100
of
assessed
valuation
in
the
sierra
national
forest
and
those
are
the
figures
that
i
am
giving
you
now.
now,
all
of
those,
obviously,
are
not
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
very
small
percentage
of
that
tax
yield
would
be
from
federal
housing.
we
have
a
lot
of
family
cabins
that
are
located
on
99
year
leases,
and
that
is
were
the
bulk
of
that
evaluation.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
no,
i
think
it
is
different.
i
think
--
and
i
think
this
is
the
contention
that
the
united
states
is
making.
all
the
precedent
up
till
now
except
for
the
grave’s
cases
been
where
a
private
contractor,
a
corporation
has
been
using
government
property
for
its
own
beneficial
use
and
enjoyment.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
--
mr.
james
b.
waterman
we
do.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
well,
commercially
for
land
and
approved
--
and
these
are
commercial
excises
now;
it’s
$36,395.00
as
of
last
year.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
yes,
we
do.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
no,
i
understand
it,
i
think
michigan
had
a
similar
type
of
tax;
it
is
probably
not
--
i
think
they
call
it
a
used
tax
of
a
sort
there.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
other
states
that
have
it
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
it
has
to
be
an
exclusive
possession
under
our
definition.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
and
this
is
what
the
court
found
there
was.
mr.
james
b.
waterman
thank
you.
