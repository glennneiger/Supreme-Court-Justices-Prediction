mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
return
the
case
somewhat
to
the
issue
before
which
is
the
validity
of
these
seizures
under
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
propriety
of
a
jeopardy
assessment
in
this
case
is
not
an
issue.
indeed
at
trial
mr.
leedy
had
a
witness
to
testify
about
the
jeopardy
assessment
excluded
on
the
grounds
that
he
was
not
a
contestant.
the
propriety
of
the
jeopardy
assessment
he
was
contesting
the
amount
of
--
so
i
do
not
think
we
need
to
discuss
whether
the
jeopardy
assessment
was
in
itself
proper.
i
would
like
to
help
focus
consideration
of
the
case
if
i
discuss
separately
the
three
acts
of
that
are
complained
of.
first
the
seizure
of
seven
luxury
automobiles
registered
to
g.m.
leasing.
second,
the
entry
upon
the
premises
of
the
office
bungalow.
third,
the
seizure
of
the
records
along
with
the
other
assets
remaining
in
the
office.
considerations
affecting
the
legality
of
these
three
acts
come
without
a
warrant
varies,
so
i
think
it
is
best
to
discuss
them
separately.
what
i
want
to
say
is
background
that
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
the
irs
had
very
good
reason
for
what
it
did
in
this
case.
as
the
fact
show
the
tax
payer,
mr.
norman,
had
filed
a
return
for
1970
that
gave
no
information
whatever
from
which
his
correct
tax
can
be
computed.
the
check
he
gave
in
payment
of
his
1971
tax
was
dishonored
by
the
bank
and
mr.
norman
never
filed
any
return
for
that
year.
now,
unreasonably
the
internal
revenue
service
became
concerned
about
the
collection
of
mr.
norman’s
taxes.
now,
it
began
to
investigate
but
the
investigation
formally
opened
had
not
moved
ahead
until
in
early
march
of
1973,
mr.
norman
became
a
fugitive
from
justice
after
being
convicted
for
misapplication
of
bank
funds.
that
caused
the
service
appear
they
would
never
recover
any
of
the
taxes
owed
by
mr.
norman
and
they
moved
rapidly
ahead
with
their
audit.
now,
our
brief
states
and
i
do
not
want
to
correct
any
wrong
implication
if
there
is
one
that
they
have
received
no
cooperation
from
mr.
norman.
it
is
quite
correct
that
mr.
norman
was
a
fugitive
from
justice
and
nobody
had
asked
him
prior
to
that
time
for
cooperation
after
he
became
a
fugitive
from
justice,
they
went
to
third-party
sources
to
develop
their
information.
but
the
services
sense
of
urgency
was
no
doubt
increased
by
the
fact
that
it
is
agent
applegate
testified
in
the
appendix
of
page
85.
he
said
that
there
had
been
in
this
case
missing
stocks
and
bonds,
shuffling
of
records,
a
bank
account
cleaned
out,
safety
deposit
boxes
cleaned
out,
and
cars
stolen.
so
that
they
were
quite
concerned
about
preserving
the
assets
they
could
still
find.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
it
goes
somewhat
at
least
to
the
reasonable...
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
quite
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
was
putting
this
background
in
my
think
because
it
explains
the
reasonableness
of
some
of
the
actions
that
the
irs
took
in
trying
to
get
the
property.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
no
i
am
not
discussing
the
jeopardy
assessment
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
am
discussing
the
entries
and
so
forth
to
the
background.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
am
going
to
suggest,
i
think
that
the
reasonableness
of
an
entry
in
certain
kinds
of
cases
could
be
drawn
into
question
for
outrageous
entry,
a
private
residence
for
example.
it
might
be
a
different
kind
of
case,
i
am
just
trying
to
describe
the
kind
of
case
this
is.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
made
to
describing
the
urgency
which
they
began
to
feel
about
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
am
suggesting
that
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
if
needed
probable
cause
the
former
probable
cause
it
needed
i
believe
was
an
assessment.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
do
not
think
so
mr.
justice
white
unless
it
needed
an
assessment.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
no,
i
think
they
have
to
have
a
good
faith
belief
that
there
is
property
in
the
premises.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
assets
of
the
taxpayer,
and
i
should
point
out
that
the
service,
as
a
matter
of
policy
does
not
enter
private
residences
if
there
is
any
objection
unless
consent
is
given.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
is
motivated
by
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
is
motivated
by
their
concern
that
private
residences
have
a
much
greater
privacy
interest.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
would
think
so.
i
cannot
speak
as
to
the
reason
why
they
do
the
regulations
that
way,
i
know
they
were
concerned
about
the
privacy
interest
whether
they
were
concerned
about
a
fourth
amendment
issue,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
probable
cause
varies
mr.
justice
white
from
case
to
case
and
i
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
do
not
know
if
we
are
talking
about
the
same
thing,
what
i
am
saying
is
you
cannot
forget
about
certain
pre-requisites,
which
may
call
probable
cause.
one
is
that
there
is
an
assessment,
and
the
other
is
that
there
is
reason
to
believe,
there
is
property
on
the
premises
of
the
taxpayer,
which
can
be
used
to
satisfy
the
obligation
of
the
tax.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think,
--
yes,
if
they
had
no
idea
whether
these
premises
were
the
taxpayers
or
whether
there
was
any
property
anywhere
around,
i
think
that
would
be
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
certainly,
that
is
our
position.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
but
i
think
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
a
case
when
it
is
the
taxpayer’s
property,
that
would
almost
always
be
probable
cause
to
think
that
this
building
was
seized
as
well.
and
there
would
almost
always
be
probable
cause
to
suppose
that
there
were
assets
in
an
office
building.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
evidence
mr.
justice
rehnquist
of
what?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
do
not
think
one
could
use
this
kind
of
entry
to
secure
evidence
of
a
crime
were
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
those
could
be
seized
for
the
purposes
that
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
let
me
say
two
things
about
that.
there
was
a
later
increase
in
the
income
for
one
of
these
years
but
that
information,
that
is
increase
in
the
assessment,
the
deficiency,
that
information
did
not
come
from
these
books
or
records.
the
irs
went
in
to
gather
assets,
there
were
books
and
records,
they
took
them
for
two
reasons.
one
reason
was
they
thought
that
the
records
might
themselves
contain
assets
such
as
stock
certificates.
the
other
is
they
thought
the
records
might
indicate
the
location
of
other
property
of
the
taxpayer,
and
that
is
not
an
investigatory
reason
such
as
you
would
have
in
a
criminal
case
that
is
simply
means
of
tracking
down
property,
and
all
of
this
is
taken
in
that
kind
of
a
seizure
of
records.
it
seems
to
me
is
a
property
interest
not
a
privacy
interest.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
mr.
chief
justice.
i
do
not
believe
they
did
find
it
from
these
records.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
they
made
the
first
entry
into
the
bungalow
office
on
the
21st
of
march.
they
backed
out
when
they
saw
a
stove,
a
refrigerator
because
they
thought
it
might
be
a
private
residence
but
it
was
not.
that
night,
they
saw
people
carrying
boxes
of
things
out
of
the
building,
and
in
the
morning,
they
discovered
that
the
stutz
automobile,
which
had
been
in
the
garage,
which
they
had
not
seized
disappeared,
they
later
recovered
that.
it
turned
out
that
it
was
removed
by
the
younger
norman
and
they
later
recovered.
but
i
suppose
the
automobiles
in
this
case
are
the
most
important
issues
in
the
internal
revenue
service,
because
it
seizes
assets
of
that
type
everyday
and
it
is
very
important
in
the
collection
of
taxes.
and
i
think
it
would
probably
impractical,
given
the
dispersion
of
property
that
taxpayers
mostly
have
to
impose
a
warrant
requirement
on
that
kind
of
seizure.
for
one
thing,
the
fourth
amendment
requires
that
the
places
and
so
forth
be
described
with
particularity
which
means
that
you
have
to
search
for
the
property
then
post
a
guard
then
go
back
and
get
a
warrant.
and
you
have
multiple
applications
in
many
cases
as
they
kept
locating
new
property,
which
would
also
thrust
the
courts
i
must
say
into
the
day-to-day
administration
of
the
internal
revenues
service.
now,
the
core
value
of
the
fourth
amendment,
i
take
it
to
be
the
protection
of
privacy
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
value
is
not
even
implicated
in
the
process
of
levying
upon
automobiles.
the
petitioner
here
makes
no
point
that
there
was
any
entry
upon
any
private
premises
to
seize
the
automobiles
and
indeed
they
were
found
on
parking
lots
and
public
garages,
and
i
think
one
of
them
was
found
on
the
streets
though,
i
am
not
entirely
sure.
but
there
is
no
privacy
interest,
the
only
thing
that
is
at
stake
here
is
a
seizure
for
a
property
interest
and
the
united
states
has
a
property
interest
superior
to
that
of
george
norman
or
his
alter
ego,
the
petitioner
here.
and
that
is
shown
i
think
by
the
fact
that
anything
that
was
seized,
which
ultimately
be
held
and
have
been
improperly
seized,
is
fully
compensable
by
damages,
which
an
invasion
of
a
privacy
interest
never
is.
and
i
should
note
that
a
full
deficiency
notice
listing
issue
the
items,
deficiency
has
been
served
upon
the
taxpayer
and
that
mr.
norman
is
now
on
the
tax
court
with
his
attorney
contesting
the
amount
of
the
deficiency.
i
think
that
is
sufficient,
it
think
the
automobiles
seizure
covered
by
murray’s
lessee
case
which
we
discussed
in
our
brief
and
i
think
it
is
sufficient
to
dispose
of
that
issue
in
favor
of
the
united
states.
it
is
only
a
property
interest
at
stake,
and
i
think
the
interest
of
the
unites
states
and
the
flexibility
in
collecting
its
efficiency,
in
collecting
amounts
due
it
by
delinquent
taxpayers
fully
justifies
that.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
mr.
justice
powell,
i
think
if
they
had
seized
the
automobile
in
the
garage.
i
think
that
would
still
have
been
reasonable
and
that
i
think
brings
me
to
the
question,
to
the
entry
into
the
office
because
they
had
to
remove
the
--
they
removed
the
lock
on
the
garage
where
they
are
about
to
seize
the
automobile
when
the
younger
norman
protested.
so
they
did
not
seize
it.
but
had
they
seized
it,
i
take
it
there
would
have
been
less
of
a
privacy
interest
in
the
garage
than
it
would
have
been
if
there
was
any
in
the
office,
but
i
do
not
think
it
made
any
difference.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
would,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
know
that
i
am
willing
to
say
that
it
was
not
in
the
garage,
but
it
is
slightly
the
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
that
is
quite
right.
now,
i
think
i
have
discussed
the
automobile
sufficiently,
the
sheer
number
of
them,
the
dispersion
of
them
the
fact
that
it
is
easily
movable,
the
fact
that
they
were
not
--
they
were
in
public
places
and
so
forth.
i
think,
it
sufficiently
establishes
the
reasonableness
of
that
seizure.
now
i
want
to
talk
about
the
second
entry
into
the
office.
it
is
helping
to
place
those
evincing
context.
i
think
i
briefed
us
so
adequately
and
i
would
like
to
go
over
the
facts
about
how
they
discovered
that
there
were
such
an
office
and
so
forth.
i
have
mentioned
that
they
entered
once,
saw
the
stove
and
the
refrigerator
and
backed
out.
now
at
that
point
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
think
so,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
the
record
shows,
george
norman
iii,
the
son,
who
was
19-years-old
at
that
time,
testifies
at
page
34
of
the
appendix,
that
he
had
moved
in
for
security
purposes
because
there
have
been
some
break-ins.
it
was
not
as
if,
it
was
an
established
residence,
he
had
moved
in
to
protect
the
office,
he
was
leaving
there.
so
i
do
not
think
that
is
quite
the
same
or
they
were
near
the
same
as
a
private
interest,
and
when
the
office
was
seized
he
went
back
to
his
father
and
mother’s
house.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
if
this
were
a
residence,
it
would
be
a
more
difficult
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
am
asking
you
to
decide
the
case
in
reply
to
a
non-residence
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
think
the
degree
of
residence
that
was
involved
here
that
is
that
--
which
they
could
not
have
known,
that
is
that
george
norman
iii,
who
was
19
had
moved
in
here
for
security
purposes,
does
not
change
this
into
a
classic
residential
dwelling.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct,
they
went
in
and
they
saw
the
stove
and
the
refrigerator
and
out
of
abundance
of
caution
went
out.
then
two
things
happened,
one
was,
that
they
talked
to
mr.
red,
a
contractor,
who
said
that
he
had
worked
in
there
and
it
was
an
office.
the
other
was
that
they
began
to
see
materials
being
taken
out
at
night.
now,
the
record
unfortunately,
although
we
refer
to
an
entrance
on
the
21st
when
they
backed
out
and
an
entrance
on
the
23rd,
if
you
look
at
the
appendix
mr.
justice
stevens,
it
turns
out
on
pages
34,
59
and
77,
some
people
testified
that
the
entrance
took
place
the
next
day
on
the
22nd,
right
after
they
saw
the
property
being
removed.
but
other
people
testify
that
no,
it
was
the
23rd,
and
the
record
is
a
very
unsatisfactory
state
about
that,
and
nobody,
apparently
focused
on
that
issue
at
the
trial
level.
they
went
back
into
the
building,
but
i
would
place
in
addition
to
the
circumstances
surrounding
this.
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
a
property
interest
is
at
stake
and
not
really
a
privacy
interest.
i
think
we
ought
to
point
out
that
what
was
done
here
follows
about
700
years
of
anglo-american
legal
history.
that
is
at
least
since
the
13th
century,
this
kind
of
thing
has
been
regularly
done.
at
english
common
law,
it
is
quite
clear
it
was
done,
as
our
brief
describes
in
the
colonies
of
the
united
states.
it
is
quite
clear
that
states
such
as
pennsylvania
and
massachusetts,
and
others,
which
had
provisions
on
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
after
adopting
those
prohibitions,
adopted
statutes
that
allowed
what
was
done
here
and
much
more
than
what
was
done
here.
so
that
i
think,
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
written
against
the
background
of
english
and
american
legal
history
and
of
state
constitutional
law
which
shows
that
it
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
entries,
to
seize
the
property
of
the
taxpayer
who
was
delinquent
in
order
to
satisfy
his
tax
obligations.
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
to
search
to
see,
whether
or
not
a
person
owe
taxes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is
quite
correct
mr.
justice
stewart,
by
the
writ
of
assistance,
a
general
writ
of
assistance
was
an
authority
search
almost
at
random
to
see
whether
there
was
property
in
the
houses
and
had
no
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
quite
correct.
whereas
this
is
quite
different,
this
is
a
case
in
which
it
has
been
determined
that
taxes
are
owned
by
a
specific
person
and
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
he
has
property
on
business
premises.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
it
has
been
determined
in
this
case
for
example
after
consultation
with
the
revenue
council,
with
all
the
agents,
it
was
quite
a
federal
investigation
here.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct,
but
that
is
precisely
what
has
happened
throughout
our
history,
from
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
on
the
first
congress
which
proposed
the
adoption
of
the
fourth
amendment
along
with
the
rest
of
the
bill
of
rights
of
course.
also
passed
a
statute
allowing
the
stress
of
the
collection
of
taxes
to
be
levied
by
the
stress
on
the
sale
and
that
contemplated
the
procedure
that
was
used
here.
so
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
original
understanding
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
that
this
kind
of
entry
was
lawful
and
does
not
require
warrant
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
advance
the
position
that
brought
here
today
mr.
justice
marshall.
there
maybe
circumstances.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
we
had
three
weeks?
oh,
i
see
mr.
justice
marshall.
in
this
kind
of
a
case
in
an
entry
upon
business
premises,
i
think
the
irs
does
not
need
a
warrant.
i
would
not
go
so
far
as
to
make
that
statement
as
to
a
private
residence
and
the
irs
does
not
go
so
far
as
to
do
that
kind
of
thing
with
private
residence.
but
i
would
say
that
in
addition
to
the
practice
of
the
irs
there
is
much
more
a
stake
here.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh
i
think
there
was
an
urgency
once
the
assessment
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
mr.
justice
marshall
the
assessment
was
actually
made
i
believe
on
the
19th,
on
the
next
day
on
the
20th
they
went
to
mrs.
norman
and
demanded
payment.
on
the
21st,
the
seizure
of
assets
began.
so,
once
the
assessment
was
made
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
have
been
arguing
that,
in
this
case
as
in
the
case
like
biswell,
the
operation
of
the
program
would
be
brought
to
a
standstill,
if
you
had
to
locate
a
property
and
then
go
get
a
warrant
for
each
item
of
property
particularly
describing
it
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
believe
it
was
seven
but
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
they
would
have
the
goal
for
example.
they
could
not
describe
where
they
were
until
they
found
them.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
but
if
you
regard
this
as
a
fourth
amendment
search
and
seizure
warrant
i
would
suppose
you
have
to
describe
their
location
and
so
forth.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
in
this
case
you
would
have
had
to
locate
the
automobiles,
post
guards
on
each
one
of
them,
can
go
back
to
the
court
and
get
the
warrant
for
the
seizure
and
since
there
was
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
record
only
says
‘several’,
but
they
did
not
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
did
not
try
to
seize
them
that
day.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
did
not
know
who
the
cars
belonged
to.
they
went
back
then
mr.
justice
marshall
and
checked
the
registration
of
those
cars
and
found
out
they
belonged
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
could
have
gotten
a
warrant.
i
am
suggesting
to
you
mr.
justice
marshall
that
if
that
requirement
were
applied
across
the
operations
of
the
irs
which
seizes
assets
everyday
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
would
also
suggest
that
in
addition
to
the
constitutional
history
there
has
been
an
unvarying
practice
under
the
constitution
for
almost
200
years
and
that
any
rule
applied
in
this
case
that
would
require
a
warrant
in
circumstances
like
this
would
also
put
into
jeopardy,
put
in
the
parole,
the
operation
of
all
the
states
in
their
enforcement
of
judgments
and
their
execution
on
judgments,
for
example.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
no
mr.
justice
white,
the
fact
that
it
was
a
jeopardy
assessment
it
could
have
been
just
a
plain
assessment.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
but
also,
i
think
it
is
usual
to
recognize
that
this
is
indistinguishable
from
what
happens
in
the
execution
of
judgments
all
over
the
country
and
in
fact
in
the
very
jurisdiction
in
which
it
arose,
utah.
the
rule
of
civil
procedure
there,
64(b)
says
that
if
a
sheriff
is
executing
a
judgment
he
makes
a
public
demand
for
property
in
a
building,
and
if
the
demand
is
refused
the
statute
says,
he
must
cause
the
building
to
be
broken
open
and
take
the
property
into
his
possession
and
if
necessary
he
may
call
to
his
aid
the
power
of
the
county.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
so
far
as
the
rule
appears
on
his
face
mr.
justice
stewart
it
does,
i
do
not
know
what
the
practice
is.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
certainly
does
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
they
live
in
this
society
as
the
rest
of
us
do
and
they
recognize
it,
there
is
a
privacy,
interest
in
a
public
home
which
they
do
not
wish
to
invade.
now,
what
they
do
with
the
private
home
is
elected
padlock
and
then
negotiate.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
may
padlock
a
home
and
then
negotiate.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
indeed,
and
i
think
the
evidence
shows
that.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
there
is
much
less
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
there
is
in
his
home
and
see
against
seattle
says
specifically
that
the
court
does
not
mean
to
imply
that
the
privacy
interest
in
this
kind
of
this
kind
a
government
or
regulation
case
is
not
less
in
an
office
than
it
is
in
a
private
residence.
i
think
practically
that
is
quite
true,
it
is,
and
secondly,
what
the
entry
here
was
not
for
the
purpose
of
an
investigatory
search,
it
was
here
just
to
seize
property
and
what
is
at
stake
really
is.
(inaudible)
do
with
the
privacy
interest
is
mainly
a
property
interest
is
at
stake.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
indeed,
it
would
but
there
is
a
much
lower
privacy
interest
i
think
in
business
premises,
and
you
have
on
the
other
side
the
kinds
of
factors
that
are
recognized
in
colonnade
catering
and
biswell
and
so
forth
about
the
urgent
government
need.
and
you
have
here
a
congressional
statute
which
recognizes
this
kind
of
practice
and
has
since
the
first
congress
of
the
united
states
so
that
i
do
not
expect
a
20th
century
court
to
be
bound
absolutely
by
history
and
by
long
usage,
but
i
do
think
those
things
count
heavily
and
i
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
one
is
bound
to
regard
it
in
a
residence
in
the
sense
that
mr.
norman
jr.
testified
it
was.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
it
is
a
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no
i
think
it
is
--
he
was
residing
there.
my
point
is
simply
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
if
one
sleeps
in
one’s
office
overnight
mr.
justice
stevens
or
one
sleeps
in
one’s
office
for
a
week
to
safeguard
it,
i
do
not
think
it
attains
quite
the
height
of
privacy
that
one
has
in
one’s
regular
residence
and
dwelling
place.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
was
the
taxpayer’s
president’s
residence
in
this
record.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
am
sorry,
the
petitioner’s.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
he
was
below;
he
is
no
longer
in
the
case
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
would
not
think
so
mr.
justice
white,
and
in
an
addition
it
is
true
that
the
court
of
appeals
set-aside
all
the
findings
in
this
case
on
the
grounds
that
the
trial
court
merely
adopted
without
a
change
all
of
the
findings
submitted
by
petitioning
lawyer.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
white
i
think,
they
have
got
standing
on
the
office,
but
they
have
got
standing
to
object
to
the
entry
as
an
entry
into
a
house.
i
guess
not
far
of
that
mr.
justice
white
but
i
think
that
they
probably
do
not.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
would
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
not
as
to
tertius.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
is
quite
true
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
corporations
do
not,
i
think
see
against
seattle
suggest
that
business
premises
do
not
under
the
fifth
amendment
certainly
where
even
if
you
have
got
a
corporation
which
can
be
pierced
for
the
purpose
of
attaching
liability
to
a
private
individual
nevertheless,
that
corporation
has
no
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment,
and
for
that
reason
i
think
it
is
really
no
occasion
after
in
effect
700
years
of
history
and
almost
200
years
under
our
constitution
to
use
this
case
to
overturn
practices
that
are
common
at
every
level
of
government,
state,
local,
and
federal
and
not
just
for
tax
collection
but
also
for
execution
of
judgments.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
think
i
do
mr.
justice
blackmun
unless
it
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
was
a
sweeping
use
of
--
i
have
a
comment
about,
i
do
not
get
relevant.
my
comment
i
hope
is
relevant,
it
was
a
sweeping
seizure
of
records
of
a
corporation,
which
were
then
to
be
used
for
investigatory
purposes
and
that
is
not
true
here.
it
merely
seizing
documents
as
assets
and
as
leads
to
assets.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
to
satisfy
the
element
of
judgment.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
mr.
justice
stevens.
although
there
was
the
additional
purpose.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
did
not
know
the
records
when
they
went
in,
they
went
into
to
seize
all
assets
as
they
did
and
we
ask
if
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
therefore
be
affirmed.
