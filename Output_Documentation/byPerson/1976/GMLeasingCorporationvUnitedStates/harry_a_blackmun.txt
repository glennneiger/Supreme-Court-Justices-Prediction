justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
petitioner,
g.m.
leasing
corp.
is
a
utah
corporation
and
georgine
norman
jr.
was
its
general
manager.
norman,
however,
was
convicted
of
a
federal
crime
and
became
a
fugitive
from
justice,
and
the
internal
revenue
service
in
investigating
his
income
tax
liability
for
1970
and
1971
determined
deficiencies,
and
made
some
jeopardy
assessments.
in
the
course
of
their
collective
efforts,
agents
observed
that
the
norman
resident's
certain
expensive
show
or
collector
of
cars
and
they
subsequently
determined
that
those
automobiles
were
registered
in
the
name
of
the
petitioner
corporation.
and
further
investigation
indicated
that
the
corporation
was
engaged
in
no
business
activity.
the
service
then
concluded
that
the
corporation
was
the
alter
ego
of
mr.
norman
and
proceeded
to
levy
upon
and
seize
several
automobiles
from
a
property
in
which
the
petitioner
had
no
interest.
these
seizures
were
made
without
a
warrant.
the
agents
also
went
to
the
premises
of
the
petitioner
corporation
consisting
of
a
cottage-type
building
and
a
garage
and
made
a
warrantless
forced
entry
into
those
premises.
the
agents
made
no
seizures
at
that
time
but
tow
days
later,
again
under
the
cottage
without
a
warrant,
and
this
time,
seized
books
and
records.
the
petitioner
corporation
thereafter
instituted
this
suit.
it
claimed
that
it
was
not
norman's
alter
ego
that
the
assessments
were
invalid
and
that
the
seizures
violated
its
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment.
it
sought
return
of
the
automobiles
and
suppression
of
the
evidence,
and
damages
from
internal
revenue
service
agents.
the
district
court
entered
judgment
for
the
petitioner
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
most
part
reversed.
we
granted
certiorari
limited
to
the
fourth
amendment
or
search
and
seizure
issues.
in
an
opinion
today
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
warrantless
automobile
seizures
which
occurred
on
public
streets
and
parking
lots
or
other
open
areas
involved
no
invasion
of
privacy
requiring
a
warrant
and
were
not
unconstitutional.
we
also
hold,
however,
that
the
warrantless
entry
into
petitioner's
office
did
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
this
intrusion
was
not
justified
by
being
based
on
any
special
nature
of
the
petitioner's
business
or
regulation
of
its
activities,
but
only
on
the
ground
that
its
assets
were
seizable
to
satisfy
tax
assessments.
in
our
view,
this
does
not
justify
depriving
the
petitioner
of
its
fourth
amendment
rights
simply
because
it
is
a
corporation.
the
seizures
were
affected
on
private
property,
and
the
government's
mere
interest
in
the
collection
of
taxes
does
not
suffice
to
justify
a
per
se
exemption
from
the
usual
warrant
requirement.
furthermore,
there
were
no
accident
circumstances
relied
upon
here
to
justify
an
exception
to
that
requirement.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed
in
part
and
reversed
in
part,
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion.
