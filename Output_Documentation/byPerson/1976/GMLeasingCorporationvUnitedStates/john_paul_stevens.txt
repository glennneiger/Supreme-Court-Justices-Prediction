justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
leedy,
one
last
question
and
i
will
stop
bothering
you.
do
you
conceive
that
the
documents
have
been
returned
and
the
copies
destroyed
as
the
government
charges
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
rely
on
silverthorne?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
yet,
the
solicitor
general
has
not
said
that
in
his
brief?
maybe
we
will
ask
him
why.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
leedy,
what
remains
to
be
adjudicated
in
this
case,
the
property
has
all
been
returned
it’s
just
a
quest
of
damages?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
damages
have
remained
to
be
determined,
is
the
judgment
below
final?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
judgment,
and
send
it
back
for
retrial
on
the
issue
of
damages?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
liability,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
mentioned
entry
into
the
office.
should
we
not
for
the
purpose
of
the
case
assume
it
is
a
residence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
the
residence
of
the
son,
was
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
does
your
argument
in
this
case
depend
on
assuming
that
it
is
not
a
residence
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
know,
but
is
your
argument
--
what
are
you
asking
us
to
hold?
are
you
asking
us
to
decide
a
case
of
a
non-residence
or
decide
a
rule
that
will
apply
to
residences
as
well?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
did
not
think
it
was
a
residence,
why
did
not
they
continue
their
total
search
the
first
time
they
entered?
wasn’t
it
the
policy
not
to
search
residences?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
touched
significance
of
the
fact
that
it
is
an
office
rather
than
a
residence
but
the
trial
court
found
in
finding
number
three
that
it
was
the
residence
of
mr.
norman,
jr.
and
that
finding
was
not
set
aside
as
i
understand
it.
so
are
we
not
bound
regarded
as
a
residence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
the
sense
of
the
trial
court
found
it
to
be
a
residence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
asking
us
to
reexamine
the
finding,
look
at
the
record,
and
make
an
independent
determination
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
only
are
there
differences
between
offices
and
residences
but
there
are
differences
between
different
kinds
of
residences.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
finding
here
--
it
was
not
only
has
pointed
out
with
some
residence.
it
was
a
residence
of
someone
other
than
the
taxpayer,
it
was
equivalent
to
john
smith’s
residence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
the
taxpayer
was
mr.
norman.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
this
was
a
residence
of
tertius
(ph)
about
mr.
norman
iii,
who
constitutionally
was
equivalent
or
just
stood
any
john
smith
so
they
are
breaking
into
a
third
person
of
residence
according
to
the
finding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
purpose
of
seizing
the
documents
solely
as
leads
to
assets
would
be
sufficient
to
justify
a
warrant-less
entry
into
the
office?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
