mr.
richard
j.
leedy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
richard
leedy
from
salt
lake
city,
utah.
this
case
before
the
court
involves
the
internal
revenue
service
seizure
of
assets
pursuant
to
a
jeopardy
assessment.
the
question
upon
which
this
court
has
granted
certiorari
was
whether
or
not
such
seizures
have
violated
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
g.
m.
leasing
corporation
had
all
of
its
assets
seize
pursuant
to
such
a
jeopardy
tax
assessment
and
as
a
result,
it
dealt
the
debt
now
to
the
corporation.
those
assets
consisted
of
several
luxury
automobiles
including
four
stutz
automobiles,
two
rolls
royces
and
a
jaguar.
additionally
a
bank
account
was
seized
from
g.m.
leasing
corporation
together
with
all
of
its
books
of
records.
the
petitioner
was
a
family
owned
corporation
and
was
a
new
or
start-up
corporation
that
was
incorporated
for
the
purpose
of
leasing
luxury
automobiles.
at
the
time
of
the
seizure
the
petitioner
had
not
yet
engaged
in
the
business
of
leasing,
however,
taken
many
pre-requisite
steps
in
order
so
to
do.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
no,
your
honor
i
do
not
believe
so
they
cost
approximately
$40,000
a
piece.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
yes,
i
think
it
was
going
to
be
worldwide
your
honor.
in
fact,
two
of
these
stutzs
were
seized
from
los
angeles,
california.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
they
had
not
yet
leased
the
cars
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
well,
they
had
obtained
the
lease
forms,
they
were
preparing
the
cars
for
lease;
they
had
not
yet
have
them
for
that
amount
of
time
and
they
had
negotiated
to
acquire
a
showroom,
they
had
obtained
lease
forms,
they
contacted
prospective
lessees,
they
contacted
other
dealerships
to
see
if
they
could
obtain
cars
at
a
discount
price
for
leasing.
but
your
honor
it
is
correct
they
had
not
yet
leased
any
cars.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
the
record
shows
they
had
no
employees.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
my
recollection
your
honor,
i
am
not
positive,
but
i
think
it
was
within
the
year.
there
is
no
question
that
the
petitioner
g.m.
leasing
corporation
was
a
family
corporation
and
primarily
controlled
by
an
individual
by
the
name
of
george
i.
norman,
jr.
mr.
norman
was
a
businessman
in
salt
lake
city,
utah
and
he
have
substantial
income
and
substantial
wealth.
throughout
the
briefs
in
this
case
mr.
norman
is
referred
to
as
the
taxpayer,
and
a
taxpayer
he
was.
in
1970
one
of
the
years
under
consideration
in
this
case
he
paid
estimated
taxes
of
$290,000.
because
of
his
income
and
high
expenses
mr.
norman
was
in
the
state
of
constantly
undergoing
irs
audits.
in
fact,
he
had
undergone
an
audit
from
the
years
1963-1968
and
the
irs
auditor
was
one
particular
agent
by
the
name
of
bill
clayton.
the
evidence
of
the
trial
showed
that
an
animosity
had
developed
between
mr.
norman
and
mr.
clayton.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
i
am
not
certain
of
that
doctrine
your
honor.
mr.
clayton
was
the
irs
auditor
who
prepared
the
assessments
in
the
hester
case.
in
march
of
1973,
the
taxpayer
george
i.
norman,
jr.
became
a
fugitive
from
justice.
several
years
prior
to
his
becoming
a
fugitive
he
was
convicted
of
the
federal
crime
of
aiding
and
abetting
a
willful
misapplication
of
bank
bonds.
he
was
sentenced
to
two
years
in
prison
and
through
the
course
of
several
years,
he
had
appealed
his
conviction.
in
march
of
1973,
his
appeals
were
exhausted
and
he
was
required
to
surrender
himself
to
begin
serving
his
prison
term.
he
did
surrender
himself
to
the
marshals
in
denver,
colorado,
and
after
surrendering
himself
he
asked
permission
to
make
a
telephone
call,
the
marshal
released
him
to
go
down
the
hall
to
a
payphone
and
he
never
returned.
he
left
his
family
and
his
home,
and
incidentally
he
left
his
assets
behind
him.
mr.
bill
clayton,
the
evidence
showed
had
been
working
on
mr.
norman’s
1970
and
1971
taxes
since
october
prior
to
his
fugitive
status
in
march.
several
weeks
after
mr.
norman
became
a
fugitive,
mr.
clayton
prepared
a
statutory
notice
of
deficiency
for
mr.
norman’s
1970
1971
taxes.
he
then
recommended
that
this
assessment
to
be
a
jeopardy
assessment,
and
he
finally
recommended
that
the
petitioner
g.m.
leasing
corporation
be
considered
the
alter
ego
nominee
or
transferee
of
george
i.
norman.
in
accordance
with
those
recommendations,
the
irs
issued
a
jeopardy
assessment
and
made
demand
upon
mrs.
norman,
the
taxpayer’s
wife
for
the
payment
of
approximately
$1
million
dollars
in
taxes,
penalties
and
interest.
mrs.
norman
who
was
not
accustomed
to
her
husband’s
business,
she
was
merely
a
housewife
suggested
that
the
irs
agents
see
her
husband’s
attorney.
rather
than
so
doing
the
irs
agent’s
next
step
was
to
start
seizing
assets.
their
first
move
was
against
the
bungalow
in
salt
lake
city,
utah,
which
was
known
throughout
the
briefs
in
the
trial
as
the
cottage.
the
cottage
was
the
office
of
the
petitioner,
it
was
also
the
office
of
george
i.
norman
and
it
was
also
the
residence
of
george
norman’s
son
the
intervener
in
this
action.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
i
certainly
do,
i
would
rather
adopt
the
trials
court’s
finding
that
they
were
not
alter
ego
or
nominee
status.
the
internal
revenue
service
broke
the
locks
on
the
building
known
as
the
cottage
and
entered
and
began
searching.
upon
their
entry,
one
of
their
group
chiefs
realized
that
it
was
a
residence
as
well
as
an
office,
and
based
upon
his
own
testimony
he
said
he
was
fearful
of
violating
someone’s
constitutional
rights.
and
therefore,
he
replaced
the
locks
and
left
the
premises.
two
days
later,
the
internal
revenue
service
agents
again
broke
into
the
cottage
and
they
seized
the
entire
cottage
including
the
real
estate
and
including
the
contents
of
the
cottage,
which
included
the
books
and
records
of
the
petitioner.
the
irs
at
that
time
also
seized
all
of
the
assets
of
petitioner,
which
consisted
of
luxury
automobile
as
well
as
the
bank
account,
its
books
and
records.
petitioner
brought
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
utah
for
wrongful
levy
pursuant
to
statute
26
united
states
code
section
7426.
the
district
court
found
in
petitioner’s
favor
there
was
not
an
alter
ego
nominee
or
transferee
of
george
i.
norman,
jr.
that
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
second
aspect
of
the
petitioner’s
claims
in
the
district
court
was
that
the
assessment
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
petitioners
sought
an
injunction
against
the
collection
of
tax
and
the
seizure
of
assets.
the
court
may
wish
to
note
that
last
term
we
decided
the
shapiro
case,
which
i
believed,
had
almost
an
identical,
factual
connotation
as
the
hester
case.
in
the
hester
case,
the
petitioner
attempted
to
discover
the
basis
underlying
the
tax
assessment,
which
was
done
in
shapiro.
in
so
doing,
we
took
the
deposition
of
the
district
director
of
the
internal
revenue
service
in
salt
lake
city
and
in
shapiro
case
written
by
deposition,
the
taxpayer
proceeded
by
way
of
written
interrogatories.
under
advice
of
justice
department
council,
the
district
director
refused
to
answer
any
questions
concerning
the
tax
assessments.
two
reasons
were
given
for
the
refusal.
the
first
one
is
rather
ironic
because
they
refused
to
give
us
information
about
the
tax
assessment
because
we
do
not
have
the
taxpayer’s
consent;
if
they
had
seized
all
of
our
assets
to
pay
for
the
taxpayer’s
taxes.
the
second
reason
for
refusing
to
answer
the
question
was
the
same
reason
given
in
shapiro,
that
the
anti-injunction
act
applied
and
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
to
restrain
the
collection
of
taxes.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
the
petitioner
whose
assets
have
been
seized
your
honor
he
was
seeking
to
obtain
the
return
of
his
assets.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
i
was
referring
to
the
district
director
refusing
to
answer
the
questions,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
myself.
well,
i
was
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
who
was
not
the
taxpayer.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
i
understand.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
i
have
his
power
of
attorney,
your
honor,
and
i
do
represent
him
in
tax
court.
but
in
this
particular
case,
there
is
no
appearance
for
him
and
he
is
not
involved
in
the
case.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
his
son,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
he
became
an
intervener
when
they
seized
certain
assets
of
his
own.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
the
corporation
brought
suit
on
its
own
name,
your
honor,
for
the
assets
that
were
seized
from
the
corporation.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
my
belief
that
the
corporation
has
a
standing
of
its
own
to
bring
its
own
lawsuit,
for
the
loss
of
its
assets.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
you
would
give
notice
to
its
officers
and
directors
i
believe.
they
were
at
that
time,
that
is
in
the
record.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
there
were
three
individuals,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
yes,
i
do.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
yes,
it
has,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
he
is
no
longer
president
--
the
fugitive,
you
are
talking
about,
he
is
no
longer
the
president,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
i
believe
it
is,
yes,
your
honor.
his
son
took
over
and
--
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
yes,
but
i
believe
the
evidence
showed
that
the
son
testified
at
the
district
court
level.
he
testified
that
he
was
one
of
the
stockholders,
together
with
his
brothers.
my
recollection
is
that
a
meeting
was
held
after
the
disappearance
of
his
father
where
his
mother,
himself
and
his
aunt
were
elected
to
the
board
of
directors.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
i
am
not
certain,
but
the
officers
said
she
is
the
director.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
no,
your
honor,
he
also
prevailed
in
the
district
court
and
the
government,
did
not
appeal
as
the
decision
in
his
favor.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
there
were
two
in
a
parking
lot
in
los
angeles.
there
were
two
--
the
remainder
when
various
garages
--
is
my
recollection
in
salt
lake
city,
utah.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
the
evidence
showed
your
honor
that
when
the
irs
agents
visited
the
house,
there
were
some
in
the
driveway.
i
do
not
believe
the
seizures
of
the
automobiles
were
made
while
they
were
in
the
driveway.
they
were
made
from
various
garages,
your
honor
and
two
were
in
los
angeles,
california
in
a
parking
lot.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
could
be
wrong.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
not
as
i
view
it,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
well
they
did
for
those
--
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
now
the
door
that
they
removed
the
locks
on,
your
honor
had
to
do
with
the
office
building
where
they
went
in
and
took
the
records
of
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
i
did
not
say
that,
i
said
i
did
not
know,
your
honor,
i
did
not
believe
so.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
my
understanding
is
every
document
that
was
seized
was
returned,
including
those
of
petitioner’s.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
i
believe
the
previous
cases
of
this
court
tell
that,
your
honor.
my
recollection
is
the
silverthorne
lumber
company
case.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
i
rely
on
it
for
the
proposition
that
a
corporation
has
a
fourth
amendment
right
to
privacy.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
to
please
the
court,
at
the
trial
we
attempted
to
attack
the
assessment
that
had
been
given
because
the
government
had
counterclaim
for
foreclosure
upon
the
assets.
we
had
showed
that
the
auditor
had
failed
to
include
in
his
computations
the
fact
that
the
taxpayer
had
paid
$290,000,
that
he
had
included
in
the
assessment
some
$115,000
in
income
that
really
was
an
income
and
that
through
as
prior
audits
of
the
taxpayers,
he
knew
that
the
taxpayer
had
high
business
expenses
but
yet
he
took
no
steps
to
find
out
what
the
business
expenses
were.
again
the
trial
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
under
the
theory
that
there
is
a
presumption
of
correctness
as
to
an
assessment
but
that
the
evidence
that
we’ve
brought
forth
had
rebutted
that
presumption
of
correctness,
and
that
shifted
the
burden
to
the
government
to
show
if
there
were
any
taxes
due
annoying
at
all.
but
the
government’s
evidence
was
in
somewhat
disarray,
they
could
not
lay
a
foundation
for
their
exhibits.
they
did
not
have
necessary
witnesses
to
testify.
after
several
attempts,
the
government
rested.
the
trial
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
and
the
tenth
circuit
again
reversed
saying
that
we
had
to
show
more
error
than
we
had
to
overcome
the
presumption
of
correctness.
the
final
proposition
sought
by
the
petitioner
in
the
trial
court
was
that
the
seizure
of
its
books
and
records,
and
the
seizure
of
its
assets
violated
its
fourth
amendment
rights
to
the
federal
constitution.
that
is
the
question
upon
which
this
court
granted
certiorari.
again,
the
trial
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
and
allowed
us
how
the
damages
were
permissible
but
set
a
hearing
date
later
for
the
determination
of
damages.
the
tenth
circuit
again
reversed
that
and
there
was
a
finding
that
the
one
agent
had
acted
with
malice.
the
tenth
circuit
indicated
that
they
could
find
no
malice
in
the
record
and
it
held
that
the
taxpayers
had
acted
pursuant
to
statute
the
levy
in
the
strange
statute
and
that
therefore
there
was
no
illegal
search.
his
petitioner’s
position
that
the
levy
in
the
strange
statute
and
the
jeopardy
assessments
statute
taken
together
which
allows
a
seizure
of
property
immediately
upon
an
assessment
without
any
notice
to
the
taxpayer
and
without
any
pre-determination
of
probable
cause
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
yes,
your
honor,
that
the
seizure
of
assets
itself
is
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
that’s
what
we
are
arguing
and
urging
this
court
to
dock.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
well,
they
are
inextricably
intertwined
but
i
would
argue
that
the
entry
into
the
cottage
was
a
search
and
that
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
there
were
intelligence
agents
of
the
internal
revenue
service
participating
--
that
by
virtue
of
the
fact
the
documents
seized
were
turned
over
to
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
that
they
were
doing
more
than
merely
levying,
and
collecting
taxes
that
they
were
in
fact
searching.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
yes
sir,
i
certainly
would.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
if
the
court
is
referring
to
the
phillips
v.
commissioner
case,
no,
i
do
not
believe
so.
if
i
may
distinguish
that
case,
that
case
involve
not
a
jeopardy
assessment
but
a
situation
where
there
had
been
a
determination
with
both
sides
participating
in
the
determination
of
the
amount
of
taxes
do
annoy.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
i
think
shapiro
held
to

i
guess
the
precise
holding
is
the
anti-injunction
act
does
not
apply
to
such
an
extent
that
the
taxpayer
cannot
challenge
the
basis
for
the
assessment.
in
fact,
there
is
no
factual
basis
underlying
the
assessment
then
he
is
entitled
to
an
injunction
to
prevent
the
collection
of
taxes.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
that
was
the
precise
factual
situation
in
shapiro,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
to
please
the
court,
there
were
many
items,
which
were
not
the
property
of
the
petitioner,
which
were
seized
and
not
returned.
all
of
the
petitioner’s
property
has
been
returned,
with
the
exception
of
the
automobiles.
but
there
were
furnishings
and
furniture
and
other
items
that
belonged
to
the
taxpayer
that
were
seized
to
having
value
and
they
have
not
been
returned.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
i
believe
so
your
honor,
the
remedy
for
violation
of
the
petitioner’s
rights.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
well,
the
tenth
circuit
reversed
that
judgment,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
no,
it
just
reversed
it
outright
and
said
that
there
is
no
liability.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
to
please
the
court,
i
believe
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
warrant
is
applicable
to
a
tax
payer
seizure.
one
might
look
at
the
legislative
history
surrounding
the
adoption
of
the
fourth
amendment
which
i
think
clearly
shows
that
the
tax
collector’s
seizure
of
property
was
in
the
contemplation
of
the
framers
of
the
fourth
amendment.
most
of
that
legislative
history
has
gone
into
my
opening
brief
and
i
would
rather
than
repetitious,
i
would
just
simply
state
that
i
believe
that
the
legislative
history
supports
the
proposition
that
the
seizure
of
assets
by
a
tax
collector
is
within
the
meaning
of
the
word
‘seizure’
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
second
question
revolves
around,
is
once
you
determine
that
the
tax
collector’s
seizure
is
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment,
the
next
question
is
whether
or
not
a
warrant
should
be
required
before
that
seizure.
or
whether
or
not
their
exigent
circumstances
precedent,
which
were
dispensed
for
the
requirement
of
warrant.
it
is
the
petitioner’s
position
that
there
are
no
such
exigent
circumstances
and
as
the
governments
position
that,
there
are.
government
cites
for
support
the
fact
that
the
tax
payer
was
a
fugitive.
the
fact
that
he
had
not
assisted
or
cooperated
in
the
preparation
of
his
assessment
or
tax
returns
and
the
final
reason
that
certain
properties
had
disappeared,
and
therefore,
they
felt
their
were
exigent
circumstances
which
justified
the
dispensation
with
the
warrant.
i
would
submit
the
fact
of
the
petitioner
that
the
tax
payers
are
fugitive,
has
no
bearing
on
whether
or
not
the
collection
of
the
taxes
is
in
jeopardy
because
all
of
the
assets
were
left
behind
that
he
had
no
control
over
the
assets.
but
even
more
importantly
he
had
been
a
fugitive
for
approximately
two-three
weeks
before
the
issuance
of
the
jeopardy
assessment
and
there
would
certainly
be
time
to
obtain
a
warrant
within
that
period
of
time.
the
second
question
of
whether
or
not
he
cooperated
in
the
preparation
of
his
taxes,
i
again
do
not
have
any
understanding
of
how
that
bears
upon
whether
the
collection
is
in
jeopardy
or
not.
but
i
would
submit
that
the
record
is
devoid
of
any
request
on
the
part
of
the
irs
to
obtain
his
cooperation
that
in
fact
the
agent
himself
referred
to
go
to
third-party
sources
to
obtain
his
information
about
the
tax
payer.
the
final
argument,
your
honors,
pertaining
to
this
question
is
the
disappearance
of
property.
you
recall
the
irs
agents
entered
into
the
cottage
on
one
particular
day
and
then
they
left
shortly
after
that.
that
time
they
left
men
keeping
surveillance
on
the
cottage
and
they
observed
that
evening
certain
boxes
of
material
being
taken
by
unknown
persons.
two
days
later
or
a
day-and-a-half
later,
they
then
decided
to
make
their
seizures.
i
would
submit
number
one,
that
they
had
already
made
the
determination
of
jeopardy
prior
to
that
occurrence
so
that
could
not
have
been
a
relevant
factor
and
number
two,
that
within
the
day-and-a-half
period
they
could
have
certainly
have
had
time
to
obtain
the
detached
neutral
magistrate’s
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
the
man
owed
any
taxes,
whether
or
not
those
taxes
were
in
jeopardy.
the
final
argument
that
the
petitioners
use
is
the
argument
which
is
often
stated
in
tax
cases
and
that
is
that
the
government
has
a
compelling
and
urgent
need
to
collect
his
taxes,
and
therefore,
there
are
exigent
circumstances,
which
would
do
away
with
the
requirement
of
obtaining
the
magistrate’s
decision.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
while
i
have
heard
that
statement
made
in
many
tax
cases.
i
do
not
know
what
is
so
urgent
and
compelling
about
the
collection
of
this
man’s
taxes
and
finally,
i
believe
in
this
day
and
age
of
budget
deficits
and
deficits
spendings
that,
that
while
at
once
may
have
been
an
urgent
need
of
the
government.
it
is
no
longer
such
an
urgent
need,
at
least
no
more
urgent
than
the
government’s
need
to
obtain
evidence
against
criminal
suspects.
therefore,
in
conclusion,
your
honors,
we
believe
that
the
entry
into
the
cottage
for
the
purpose
of
seizing
books
and
records
was
a
search.
we
believe
that
the
seizure
of
assets
is
also
a
seizure
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
therefore
the
general
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment
should
apply
that
a
warrant
be
obtained
and
that
there
were
no
exigent
circumstances
in
this
case
which
would
dispense
with
the
requirement
of
warrant.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
i
was
going
to
indicate
i
believe
my
time
is
almost
gone
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
one
issue
i
would
like
to
take
with
the
solicitor
general
that
appeared
in
the
brief
and
also
appears
in
the
argument
here
and
that
is
that
the
seizure
of
the
assets
is
not
a
seizure
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
not
entitled
as
protection
because
in
essence
they
are
seizing
a
property
interest
and
there
is
therefore
no
violation
of
a
privacy
interest.
i
would
take
issue
of
that
as
i
understand
the
right
to
privacy,
the
right
to
be
at
let
alone
from
government
interference.
i
would
think
it
is
particularly
acute
when
in
fact
a
premise
is
entered
into,
but
also
when
the
property
is
seized
and
one
is
dispossessed
as
the
ownership
of
the
property.
i
think
that
that
is
just
as
much
a
violation
of
a
privacy
interest
as
it
is
a
property
interest
and
i
would
cite
this
court
to
it’s
case
in
1-1958
plymouth
sedan
v.
pennsylvania,
which
is
380
u.s.
693
which
is
a
forfeiture
proceeding
against
an
automobile
where
in
this
court
held
that
the
fourth
amendment
applied
when
seeking
to
deprive
an
owner
of
the
ownership
of
this
property.
consequently,
i
believe
it
is
superficial
to
say
that
all
we
are
doing
is
dispossessing
a
person
of
a
property
interest,
therefore,
no
privacy
interest
is
affected
and
therefore
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply.
i
believe
that
privacy
interests
are
affected
when
a
person’s
property
is
taken
away
from
you.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
no,
your
honor.
the
original
case
was
brought
by
the
petitioner.
subsequent
to
the
bringing
of
the
original
case,
the
irs
seized
additional
assets
from
the
son.
he
then
intervened
in
this
action
and
one
in
the
trial
court
and
the
irs
did
not
appeal
the
decision
as
to
him
but
returned
the
assets
to
him.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
yes,
i
think
there
would
be,
your
honor.
yes,
because
they
returned
the
stock
to
him
but
the
value
may
have
declined.
yes,
i
believe
there
was.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
the
only
person
before
this
court
is
g.m.
leasing
corporation,
the
petitioner.
the
irs
conceded
the
correctness
of
the
trial
court’s
decision
with
respect
to
the
son.
that
is
the
only
way,
i
do
not
know
how
to
answer,
but
technically,
i
presume
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
damages
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
j.
leedy
yes
sir,
thank
you.
