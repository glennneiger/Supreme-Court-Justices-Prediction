is

to
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
he
have
to
intervene,
if
he
represents
the

justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
that
was
his
corporation,
he
would
not
have

wouldn’t
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
is
a
one
man
corporation
--
is

marshall

justice
thurgood
marshall
you

saying

--
i
am
asking,

not
really

do
you?

justice
thurgood
marshall

is

justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
were
all
of
them
aware
of
the
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
case
--
whether
in
the
street
or
whether
in
the
garage.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
one
or
the
other
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
seized
on
the
public
streets?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
don’t
you
know
the
record?
oh,
you
want
me
to
--
okay,
i
will
check.
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
position
is
--
you
never
need
a
warrant.
the
irs
is
involved,
you
never
need
a
warrant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
you
are
pretty
close
to
it
because
you
had
weeks,
you
had
three
weeks
here.
didn’t
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
see
i
have
trouble
with
the
practical
point
because
it
is
just
as
easy
to
go
and
get
a
warrant.
there
is
no
urgency
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
know,
i
cannot
recognize
an
urgency
when
you
stand
for
three
weeks.
i
have
great
difficulty.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
three
days?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
that
when
they
knew
about
these
six
cars,
wasn’t
it
six?
justice
thurgood
marshall
seven,
when
they
know
about
those,
could
not
they
have
gotten
a
warrant
to
seize
those?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
they
could
describe
the
cars.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
just
recognize
the
fourth
amendment
is
there,
it
is
my
trouble,
and
i
can
understand
why
in
certain
occasions
irs
has
a
great
emergency
and
the
guys
at
the
airport
with
a
bundle
of
money
under
their
bag
may
take
off.
i
would
require
as
to
go
any
place.
but
if
the
man
is
on
his
way
walking,
for
three
day
walk
i
think
you
would
have
time
to
get
a
warrant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
cars
did
you
see
in
the
driveway
the
first
day
they
went
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
several.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
could
have
gotten
a
warrant
that
day.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
they
could
have
gotten
a
warrant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
also
think
mr.
solicitor
that
on
the
opposite
side
of
that
coin;
i
do
not
think
i
would
give
irs
three
years
to
act.
and
i
do
not
want
to
say
that
you
do
not
want
a
broad
rule
one
way,
i
do
not
want
a
broad
rule
the
other
way.
how
do
you
get
in
the
middle?
