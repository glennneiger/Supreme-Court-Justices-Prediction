justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
that,
is
your
claim
that
even
if
there
had
been
no
entry
into
the
corporate
premises?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
you
need
a
warrant
to
seize
those
automobiles
for
example.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
another
claim
that
even
if
that
is
not
so
the
entry
into
the
premises
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
a
separate
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
they
have
found
two
cars
on
a
public
street
and
two
cars
sitting
in
a
driveway
on
private
property.
would
you
make
the
same
argument
about
all
those
cars?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
think
that
prior
cases
of
this
court
wanted
the
seizure
of
those
four
cars
that
i
just
described?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
shapiro
held,
you
refer
to
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
shapiro
recognized
that
there
can
be
a
seizure
first
and
a
hearing
later?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
if
you
needed
the
--
if
the
board
decides
that
you
needed
to
enter
this
premises
you
are
probably
suggesting
that
there
is
some
probable
cause.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
think
that
the
government
needed
probable
cause
to
enter
these
premises?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
i
asked
you
whether
they
needed
probable
cause.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
us
assume
there
is
a
jeopardy
assessment
and
you
say
it
is
valid,
assume
that.
now
the
government
is
then
authorized
to
enter
any
private
premises
of
the
tax
payer
whether
or
not
it
believes
there
is
property
in
the
premises
that
they...?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
position
is
still
is
though
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
requirement,
to
enter
the
premises
of
the
government,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
whatever
it
was,
you
say,
you
could
forget
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
much
was
necessary
in
any
event
in
effect
to
enter
the
premises.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
surely,
even
so
your
position
certainly
is
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
any
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
books,
the
books
of
the
company.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
what
about
the
books
of
the
corporation.
suppose
that
all
(inaudible)
in
the
house
or
in
the
premises
with
the
books,
the
corporate
books?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
know
they
were
not
worth
anything,
you
would
not
pay
any
taxes.
it
would
be
the
source
of
information
where
you
could
determine
the
amount
of
the
assessment
accurately
and
where
some
assets
might
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
in
the
garage?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
like
the
factor
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
not
distinguish
this
case
at
the
jeopardy
assessment
for
many
other
situations.
the
commissioner
is
entitled
to
levy
in
despair.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
is
the
young
norman
whose
residence
this
was,
a
party
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
the
taxpayer
any
standing
to
talk
about
the
invasion
of
young
mr.
norman’s
residence?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
that
we
must
take
the
case
as
though
it
was
not
a
residence
at
all
because
a
corporation
has
any
standing
to
claim
it
is
a
residence?
or
to
object
to
an
invasion
of
the
residence?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
do
not
have
standing
to
object
to
the
breaking
into
the
door
to
the
premises
which
were
both
an
office
and
a
residence
because
they
were
not
the
only
resident?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
do
not
have
standing
to
make
this
argued,
it
is
what
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
leedy
before
you
sit
down,
will
you
refresh
my
recollection
on
just
exactly
what
the
posture
of
mr.
norman
iii,
the
son,
is
in
the
litigation
now.
is
he
advancing
the
arguments
that
you
are
making?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
does
not
have
any
pending
claim
for
damages
or
anything
like
that?
the
reason
i
asked
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
he
is
still
(inaudible).
the
reason
i
ask
is
that,
are
we
concerned
at
all
with
the
status
of
these
premises
as
a
residence
or
are
we
not,
because
in
corporation
we
only
argue
the
impact
on
itself
with
the
entry.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
event
in
this
court
we
are
only
concerned
with
the
status
of
g.m.
leasing
corporation.
justice
byron
r.
white
its
interest
in
the
premises.
