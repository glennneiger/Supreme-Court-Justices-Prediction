how
recently
had
the
company
that
incorporated?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
all
of
this
goes
to
the
reasonableness
and
validity
of
the
jeopardy
assessment
which
i
thought
you
began
by
saying,
it
was
not
an
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
in
this
case
we
began;
we
proceeded
upon
the
premise
that
there
was
a
jeopardy
assessment
and
the
validity
of
that
assessment
is
not
an
issue
here.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
suggesting
that
there
are
different
gradations
of
jeopardy
assessments?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
right
and
we
begin
then
with
a
jeopardy
assessment
as
a
given
upon
that
premise.
you
are
not
going
to
suggest
that
this
kind
of
an
entry
is
valid
in
some
kinds
of
cases
where
there
has
been
a
jeopardy
assessment
but
not
in
others?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
the
jeopardy
assessment
were
less
clearly
valid,
would
this
be
a
different
kind
of
case?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
and
assets
of
the
taxpayer?
justice
potter
stewart
that
policy
must
be
motivated
by
something.
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
in
which
constitution
of
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
adopted
however
against
the
background
of
revulsion
against
writs
of
assistance
and
general
warrants
and
specifically
against
the
background
of
the
use
of
those
devises
to
search
to
see
whether
or
not
a
person
owe
taxes,
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
specific
background,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
population
excise
tax
should
have
been
paid
to
do
advertising.
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
been
determined
unilaterally.
justice
potter
stewart
hasn’t
it
been
determined
after
any
adjudication,
which
has
been
determined
unilaterally
by
the
collector?
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
does
that
include
a
private
residence?
justice
potter
stewart
has
the
historic
practice
which
you
advised
us
is
three
or
four
or
five
century
practice
included
warrant-less
breaking
into
private
residences
to
find
property
of
a
taxpayer
who
has
been
judged
to
owe
taxes?
justice
potter
stewart
why
is
the
internal
revenue
service
has
been
so
leery
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
do
what?
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case
you
equate
this
so-called
bungalow
with
the
taxpayer’s
business
office,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
surely,
surely
you
are
not
submitting
to
us
that
there
is
no
privacy
interest
of
a
taxpayer
or
anybody
in
his
private
business
office,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
would
think
if
somebody
possibly
broken
into
my
office,
this
building,
look
for
property
that
would
also
invade
the
real
privacy,
wouldn’t
it?
