justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
case
involves
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
an
ordinance,
prohibiting
the
posting
of
real
estate
for
sale
and
sold
signs.
the
ordinance
was
enacted
in
an
apparent
effort
by
the
township
of
willingboro,
a
racially
integrated
community
to
stem
what
it
perceived
as
the
flight
of
white
homeowners
from
the
town.
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
ordinance.
by
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
ordinance
violates
the
first
amendment.
we
conclude
that
the
law
cannot
be
sustained
on
the
ground
that
it
restricts
only
one
method
of
communication
because
the
alternative
it
leaves
open
are
unsatisfactory
and
because
the
township
was
concerned
with
the
message
of
the
signs
rather
than
with
the
media.
we
also
conclude
that
the
township's
interest
in
promoting
stable,
integrated
housing
does
not
justify
the
ordinance
since
the
law
is
not
needed
to
achieve
that
objective
and
since
the
first
amendment
disables
the
township
from
achieving
that
objective
by
restricting
the
free
flow
of
truthful
commercial
information.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
