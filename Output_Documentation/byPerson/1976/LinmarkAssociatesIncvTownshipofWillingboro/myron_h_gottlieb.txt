mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
disagree
with
counsel
as
might
be
expected
or
anticipated.
i
think
that
what
the
court
has
before
is
an
ordinance
to
prohibit
or
ban
a
device
which
has
been
or
was
being
utilized
to
manipulate
willingboro
from
an
integrated
community
to
a
re-segregated
one
and
that
as
such
it
does
not
run
a
foul
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
secondly
whether
an
ordinance
which
furthers
this
legitimate
government
interest
fails
the
first
amendment
or
is
contradicted
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
i
don’t
believe
that
should
be
sustained.
i
don’t
believe
that
newspapers
first
of
all
in
discussing
this,
it's
quite
evident
that
township
council
took
the
narrowest
means
it
could
take.
newspaper
advertisement
is
not
affected.
other
means
of
the
advertisement
are
not
affected
and
the
record
reflects
shown
by
plaintiff’s
testimony
that
over
or
approximately
70%
of
all
real
estate
increase
for
the
purchase
of
a
home
comes
from
methods
other
than
‘for
sale’
signs.
we
are
not
trying
to
get
into
other
areas.
what
we
trying
to
do
is
merely
hit
the
closest
or
the
narrowest
way
we
can
approach
the
problem.
this
is
born
out
by
the
fact
further,
your
honor,
that
in
willingboro
and
again
disagreeing
with
counsel,
the
fact
of
advertisement
of
homes
for
sale
did
not
cause
panic.
the
only
thing
that
caused
panic
was
the
fact
of
the
advertisement
for
homes
of
sale
through
one
particular
mode
or
method
and
that
was
the
forest
of
‘for
sales’
signs
on
the
lawns
of
all
the
homes
in
the
residential
areas.
that
was
what
was
being
attacked.
if
we
went
at
anything
else,
it
wouldn’t
be
reasonably
related
to
trying
to
solve
the
problem.
this,
in
fact
is
born
out
by
the
fact
that
it
did
solve
the
problem.
the
insecurities
and
tensions
and
problems
existing
in
willingboro,
prior
to
the
ban
of
‘for
sale’
and
‘sold’
signs
were
diminished
strongly.
they
were
not
entirely
eradicated
but
they
were
diminished
to
quite
an
extent
and
that
evidence
is
absolutely
un-contradicted
in
the
record.
it's
quite
clear
that
this
nation
has
a
national
policy
as
to
housing
and
perhaps…
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
no
sir,
it
is
not.
it
does
show
that
the
number
of
homes
which
were
indeed
sold
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
ordinance
is
about
the
same.
there
has
been
no
diminution
of
sales.
one
realtor
testified
he
was
selling
the
same
one
said
more.
so,
at
least
we
have
got
to
assume
it
is
the
same.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
i
don’t
know
whether
there
was
a
change
in?
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
the
ordinance
is
merely
to
prohibit
‘for
sale’
signs
in
order
to
reduce
the
people
who
are
residing
in
the
community,
who
are
selling,
based
solely
on
fear
and
it's
addressed
solely
to
this
one
issue
of
stability.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
no
sir.
quite
to
the
contrary
the
evidence
although
as
many
people
were
selling
as
before,
it
does
not
show
why
they
were
selling
now,
it
does
show
that
of
those
who
were
selling
and
again
the
evidence
is
un-contradicted
here,
that
there
was
less
vocalization
if
i
may,
by
people
who
have
sold
their
homes
or
were
in
the
process
of
selling
their
homes
or
had
decided
to
sell
their
homes
as
that
in
fact
they
were
selling
or
had
decided
to
sell
because
of
fear
of
being
left
there,
of
an
unstable
community,
a
fear
of
being
left
there
the
last,
the
neighborhoods
changing
that
type
of
concept.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
that
may
in
fact
be
the
case
sir.
willingboro
did
not
choose
the
legislative
judgment
of
the
township
council
was,
that
this
was
the
most
appropriate
course
based
upon
the
recommendation
of
the
human
relations
commission
and
the
various
public
hearings
that
were
held.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
it
would
now
be
impermissible.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
well,
there
are
certain
signs
which
are
permitted.
professional
nameplates,
if
you
would
or
a
physician
or
an
attorney
or
someone
of
a
permitted
professional
use
in
a
residential
area
is
permitted.
with
that
exception
no
other
and
i
am
not
sure
how
much
of
an
exception
that
is,
no
other
commercial
advertisement
is
allowed
in
a
residential
district.
the
state
of
new
jersey
through
its
courts
has
determined
that
a
municipality
may
not
prohibit
political
signs,
so
that
we
do
not
try
to
regulate
that.
we
accept
the
state
court
law
that,
in
fact,
political
signs
may
not
be
regulated,
at
least
to
the
extent
of
being
prohibited,
i
would
assume
that,
they
could
be
kept
back
from
the
roadway
in
the
interest
of
traffic
safety
or
something
entirely
not
raised
here.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
no,
no,
i
do
not
think
we
can
approach
newspaper
advertisements
and
we
are
not
trying
to
approach
newspaper
advertisements.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
the
factual
findings,
in
this
particular
case
were
that
newspaper
advertisements
did
not
stir
up
the
residents,
office
increase
or
a
listing
in
the
multiple
listing
service
booklet
or
pamphlet
did
not
stir
up
people.
the
soul
thing
that
steered
up
people
were
the
abundance
of
'for
sale'
signs,
the
signs
that
when
people
would
walk
to
and
from
their
home
to
take
a
walk
in
their
neighborhood
or
to
drive
to
and
from
work
or
to
go
to
the
store
or
take
your
child
to
walk
him
or
her
to
school,
that
was
what
did
it.
this
dominating
presence.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
it
does
not,
there
is
a
mention
quite
candidly
where
at
the
two
public
hearings
held
on
this,
a
realtor
at
one
of
the
hearings
and
i
believe
it
was
the
first
hearing,
stood
up
and
indicated
that
according
to
our
monthly
review
at
the
previous
month,
there
were
230
or
200
'for
sale'
signs
up,
willingboro
having
a
community
of
11000.
i
have
no
idea
how
many
other
homes
were
up
for
sale
through
not
utilizing
signs.
the
indication
further
maybe
refined
by
two
other
factors.
the
indication
of
the
witness,
if
i
recall
correctly
was,
this
was
other
realtor
signs,
it
did
not
take
into
account
i
believe,
me
trying
to
sell
my
own
home.
finally,
this
survey
was
taken
in
the
month
of
january,
one
would
tend
to
suspect
through
experience,
the
january
'for
sale'
signs
on
the
front
lawn
are
much
less
in
may,
june,
this
time
of
the
year,
when
most
of
the
real
estate
business
goes
on.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
i
just
can’t
indicate
this.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
that’s
quite
correct
indeed,
everybody
indicated
in
testifying
that
there
was
no
other
mode
of
advertisement
which
caused
this
panic
among
the
residents
of
willingboro
other
than
the
forest
or
“for
sale”
signs,
you
pick
with
the
signs
that
are
all
over
the
place
and
that
was
it,
that’s
what
willingboro
approached,
they
did
not
attempt
to
regulate
in
any
other
area
because
any
other
area
was
not
causing
the
problem.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
it
doesn’t
speak
one
way
or
the
other.
i
can
indicate
to
your
honor,
that
the
law
as
determined
by
the
state
courts
of
new
jersey,
it
is
that
a
municipality
may
not
prohibit
signs
of
a
political
nature.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
i
can
only
relate
your
honor
that
in
my
mind
that’s
a
policy
decision
made
by
the
first
amendment,
that
in
fact
it
is
a
political
or
philosophical
or
social
and
economic
exposition
of
order
and
idea,
that
the
first
amendment
says
we
can’t
regulate
that,
however,
here,
we
have
a
situation
where
we
have
signs
which
have
a
direct
definable
impact
on
the
present
residents
of
willingboro
which
is
resolving
and
transforming
a
community,
which
is,
i
can
say
quite
probably
a
model
in
this
nation
for
compliance
with
the
fair
housing
act,
if
not
the
model.
transforming
that
community
into
a
re-segregated
one.
now,
i
can’t
accept
the
assertion
or
the
connotation
that
the
commercial
speech
in
this
context,
which
is
clearly
against
the
public
welfare,
clearly
against
the
public
policy
because
of
its
impact
which
is
truly
deceptive
in
that
nature,
because
of
its
impact
is
entitled
to
an
elevated
permit
position
under
the
first
amendment.
i
don’t
believe
that
the
court
or
the
first
amendment
has
ever
made
that
policy
decision.
i
think
that
the
court
indeed
has
gone
so
far
in
many
of
the
cases,
i
have
cited
in
my
brief,
to
the
other
extreme
that
where
the
public
health
safety
and
welfare
of
the
community
are
concerned
and
where,
here
you
have
gone
a
national
welfare
interest
concerned
as
set
forth
in
the
title
viii,
the
fair
housing
act
that
the
court
can’t
just
out
blinders
to
its
eyes.
no
court
can,
in
fact
i
would
have
condemned
willingboro
township
council,
if
it
had
put
blinders
to
its
eyes,
and
not
acted
in
this
particular
situation.
i
would
again
indicate
to
the
court,
contrary
to
the
statement
by
federal
council
that
we
have
a
fear
psychology,
a
panic
and
it's
not
a
panic,
in
the
sense
of
everybody’s
moving,
it's
an
incipiency,
a
beginning
in
willingboro
which
was
not
conjectural.
there
was
no
indication
that
because
it
may
have
occurred,
the
record
is
filled
with
instances
where
in
fact,
it
was
occurring,
where
in
fact
there
was
a
communication
by
many
of
the
residents
that
indeed
from
up
height
and
i
am
worried
and
i
am
frustrated
and
i
am
fearful
and
that
was
what
willingboro’s
ordinance
tried
to
get
out.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
the
signs
appeared
in
every
--
willingboro
was
created
by
levitt
to
the
extent
that
we
have
various
parks,
somerset
parks,
pennypacker
park
with,
give
or
take
an
average
of
a
thousand
homes
in
each
park.
they
were
in
every
park.
it
was….
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
well,
willingboro
has
various
types
of
homes.
willingboro
has
single
family
residences,
willingboro
has
a
section
or
an
area
of
townhouses
with
colder
sacs
or
short
little
streets.
in
a
colder
sac
with
twenty
homes
or
townhouses
running
on
to
it,
which
is
perhaps
a
150
feet
long
on
both
sides,
almost
a
u
shape
to
say
that
eight
signs
or
six
signs
is
less
significant
there
than
six
signs
or
eight
signs
on
a
street
which
is
perhaps
a
quarter
of
mile
long.
i
think
the
two
factors
have
to
be
determined
here,
number
one,
the
physical
characteristic
of
the
street,
that
it's
owner
of
the
homes
bordering
that
street
and
also
the
number,
but
they
were
all
over,
there
is
no
question
that
signs
were
in
every
park,
they
were
displayed
in
every
park.
they
weren’t
singling
out,
one
or
two
or
three.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
11,000
residences,
willingboro
has
approximately
45,000
people.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
if
it
in
fact
the….
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
well,
let’s
assume
that
the
statements
made,
not
subject
to
a
cross-examination,
this
is
based
at
a
public
hearing
we
are
accurate
and
again
the
statements
made
at
taking
a
survey
in
january.
but
let’s
assume
that
they
are
accurate,
if
in
fact
and
it's
quite
clear
that
the
various
residents
of
the
community
stood
up
and
protested
about
forest
of
‘for
sale’
signs.
who
am
i
to
say
that
eight
is
forest
for
my
street
and
two
is
not
or
is
six
a
forest
and
a
11
or
just
what
one,
i
can’t
say
that
they
were
uniformly
distributed
where
a
home
had
perhaps
or
a
street
had
perhaps
50
residences
along
it,
and
it
hit
precisely
every
twentieth
home
or
at
this
end
of
the
street,
we
had
six
among
these
ten
homes
but
none
of
them
to
balance
the
street
or
maybe
one….
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
that
is
wrong.
these
figures
came
from
a
realtor
who
stood
up
and
opposed
the
ordinance
at
the
first
public
hearing
and
said,
”my
firm
took
a
survey”,
and
these
are
the
results
of
that
survey.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
that
is
correct,
sir
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
i
can
only
indicate
it
to
you,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
other
than
when
one
of
the
councilman
who
was
testifying
was
questioned
about
it,
he
said,
we
had
figures
which
we
considered
in
making
our
determination
or
arriving
at
our
judgment.
i
do
not
recall
the
figures
nor
do
i
have
them
available
here
in
court
and
this
is
at
the
trial
level.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
that
is
correct
sir….
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
the
forest
is
the
impression
of
signs
by
the
residents
of
willingboro,
the
public
itself
perceived
the
‘for
sale’
signs,
yes
sir,
whether
or
not
we
had
how
many
signs,
i
don’t
know,
the
only
indications
as
to
number
of
signs
however,
clearly
came
from
the
realtor
who
stood
up
in
opposition.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
i
perhaps
–
sounds
this
like
an
inside
joke,
i…
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
yes
sir.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
i
don’t
know
the
community
conditions
in
the
district
of
columbia,
but
here
is
a
legislative
decision
made
as
to
what
they
want
or
what
they
don’t
want.
but
if,
in
fact
it
were
to
appear
to
those
people
in
authority
able
to
make
that
decision,
that
in
fact,
there
were
a
widespread
panic
selling
atmosphere
in
the
district
of
columbia.
if,
in
fact
the
authorities,
whomever
then
may
be
were
determine
that
it
is
appropriate
to
respond
to
that,
in
order
to
maintained
the
stability
in
the
community
and
i
use
stability
in
solely
in
the
sense,
that
one
does
not
want
to
leave
willingboro
or
the
district
of
columbia,
solely
out
of
fear
and
that’s
the
way,
i
believe
it
was
used
in
the
context
of
this
case.
that
in
that
situation,
it
would
present
the
identical
issue
posed
to
the
court
in
this
case,
that
in
fact,
we
do
have
because
of
the
way
the
public
perceives
it,
a
situation
which
is
inimical
to
the
public
health
and
welfare.
the
argument
of
council
that
indeed
the
ordinance
has
been
utilized
to
discriminate
against
minorities
is
clearly
erroneous.
council
have
suggested
in
their
brief
that
because
we
are
prohibiting
‘for
sale’
signs,
that
itself
means
that
we
are
trying
to
keep
minorities
or
anyone
out.
but
the
absence
of
signs
in
and
of
themselves,
don’t
control
who
moves
in,
because
of
the
absolutely
effective
alternate
means
of
communication,
couple
that
with
the
fact
that
the
testimony
even
of
mr.
mellman,
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
or
the
petitioner
here
was
to
the
effect
that
even
though
we
have
signs
prohibited...
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
that
person
spends
15
cents,
buys
a
newspaper,
scans
the
‘home
for
sale’
column
in
the
newspaper.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
at
first,
he
has
gone
to
a
realtor
and
look
at
the
multiple
listing
service
booklet
which
lists
every
home
for
sale
in
willingboro
by
park
and
style
of
home,
colony
or…
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
well,
i
don’t
know,
if
it
breaks
it
down
to
a
particular
block
but
i
do
know
it
breaks
it
down
to
a
park,
and
in
willingboro,
the
park
system
is
such
that
if
you
live
in
pennypacker,
all
the
streets
in
that
park
begin
with
the
letter
p.
if
you
live
in
another
one,
in
and
so
on,
so
that
one
could
find
out,
if
not
that
particular
street
without
going
through
the
entirety
of
pennypackers
listing,
one
could
easily
find
out
at
least
the
neighborhood.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
i
would
assume
it
is
much
easier
to
spend
five
minutes
sitting
at
a
desk
than
to
drive
through
an
entire
community
of
45,000
people.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
you
can
do
that
or
look
at
a
classified
section
in
the
newspaper
under
the
‘homes
for
sale’
column.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
no,
but
perhaps
that
might
give
one
an
indication.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
it
is
ironic
in
response
to
your
question
perhaps
that
there
is
no
home
seeker
who
is
a
plaintiff
in
this
particular
case,
that
we
don’t
have
a
complaint
from
someone
who
wants
to
move
in,
in
detail,
we
have
a
complaint
from
a
realtor
whose
livelihood
is
the
earning
of
commissions
from
sale
realty
and
a
corporation
whose
income
is
attributed
to
the
turnover
of
real
estate.
that’s
all
we
have
here.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
no
sir,
no
sir,
the
entire
purpose...
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
no
sir,
willingboro
does
not
want
to
say
who
can
move
into
town,
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
is
clear
to
that,
un-contradicted,
the
history
of
willingboro
has
been..
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
the
fear
is
among
the
present
residents
of
willingboro
who
are
moving
not
because
they
have
been
transferred
to
wallow-wallow
(ph)
or
because
of
the
change
in
their
family
size
or
financial
considerations
or
other
things
like
that.
they
are
moving
because
they
have
got
this
(inaudible)
that
says,
i
got
to
get
out
before
it
is
too
late.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
they
are
afraid
that
in
fact,
they
will
be
left
in
a
community
which
has
change
and
by
reacting
to
that
they
are
encouraging
that.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
they
may,
i
cannot
distinguish
between
the
value,
it's
entirely
an
irrational
process
but
i
cannot
distinguish
between
a
person
wanting
to
get
out,
out
of
fear
and
say
how
much
of
that
he
attributes
to
a
decrease
in
value,
how
much
of
it
he
does
it
because
he
does
not
like
to
live
in
an
integrated
community,
how
much
of
it
he
attributes
because
he
dislikes
minorities.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
willingboro
is
an
absolutely
integrated
community,
block
by
block.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
they
maybe
fearful
that
they,
--
the
residents
maybe
left
with
the
situation
that
in
fact
a
community
might
be
all
of
–
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
predominantly,
one
race
and
i
cannot
by
the
way
say
that
this
fear
is
exclusively
confined
to
white,
the
majority,
this
fear
is
--
it's
a
part
of
being
human
and
we
are
all
human.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
it
is
about
a
15
minutes
drive,
i
live
in
willingboro,
my
office
is
in
bordentown
and
it
is
about
a
15
minutes
drive
on
the
interstate
highway.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
willingboro
is
rather.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
yeah,
approximately.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
perhaps
sir.
i
just
want
to
make
it
absolutely
clear,
however
that
in
fact
the
action
of
willingboro
was
not
to
affect
prospective,
as
shown
by
the
statistics
because
it
did
not
have
that
impact
but
present
residents
of
the
community.
as
to
the
first
amendment
argument,
obviously
petitioners
contend
there
is
a
violation.
it
is
willingboro’s
response
that
there
must
be
although,
commercial
speeches
not
wholly
outside
of
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment,
there
must
be
afforded
a
lesser
degree
of
protection
and
that
is
based
on
the
court’s
recognition,
i
believe,
i
am
quoting
from
virginia
pharmacy
of
the
common
sense
differences
between
commercial
speech
and
philosophical
or
economic
or
political
speech
or
newspapers
or
anything
like
that
and
indeed
the
court
itself
has
long
recognized
the
obvious
distinction
in
a
billboard
situation.
i
need
only
refer
back
to
packer
versus
utah,
which
i
believe
is
a
case
out
of
the
early
1930s.
the
court
has
continued
to
recognize
that
and
i
might
refer
to
the
concepts
developed
in
lehman
v.
shaker
heights,
where
the
community
in
willingboro
situation
is
having
this
trust
upon
concept,
forest
of
signs.
if
in
fact,
you
as
a
judge,
may
not
believe
that
200
and
some
signs
is
sufficient
to
create
a
forest.
i
would
submit
that
if
in
fact
because
of
the
way
the
public
perceives
it,
if
in
fact
they
believed
they
are
to
be
a
forest
of
signs.
if
in
fact
they
reacted
out
of
fear,
if
they
were
dominated
by
this
fear,
they
are
the
determining
guidelines
as
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
signs
had
this
impact.
with
respect
of
the
first
amendment,
it
clearly
shows
there
was
a
deceptive
impact.
the
signs
were
the
catalyst
for
a
process
of
resegregation.
mr.
myron
h.
gottlieb
i
thank
the
court
then.
