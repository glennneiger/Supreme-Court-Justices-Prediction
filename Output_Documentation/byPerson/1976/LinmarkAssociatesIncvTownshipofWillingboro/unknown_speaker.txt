unknown
speaker
what
could
be
your
view
if
an
ordinance
prohibited
placing
any
sign
on
the
property
at
any
time
for
any
reason.
unknown
speaker
what
about
a
sign
advertising
cigarettes
or
whisky
or
typical
billboard
sign?
unknown
speaker
this
is
matter
of
fear
that
the
time
and
place
regulations
can
be
made
of
some
public
display.
unknown
speaker
if
you
told
about
the
house,
this
ordinance
applies
to
all
property
doesn’t
it
not
just
residential
property.
unknown
speaker
your
client
linmark
associates
incorporated
according
to
a
complaint
owns
land
and
premises
in
willingboro,
is
that
residential?
unknown
speaker
is
the
corporation
limited
or
what?
unknown
speaker
i
was
not
answering
the
question
to
that,
i
was
just
wondering
why
the
corporation
should
be
owning
a
single
occupancy
dwelling.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
business
of
linmark
associates
incorporated?
unknown
speaker
now,
when
the
other
plaintiffs,
if
is
a
real
estate
agent.
unknown
speaker
mr
hauch
we
had
a
case
appeared
not
too
long
ago,
involving
the
banning
of
cigarette
advertising
on
radio
and
this
was
similarly
affirmed
upholding
the
ban.
there
was
a
message
that
was
banned.
if
we
decide
for
you
in
this
case
are
we
overruling
that
one?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
isn’t
illegal
to
smoke
cigarettes.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don’t
think
you
would
be
overruling
the
decision
in
television
advertising
case
on
cigarettes,
because
i
think
the
public
interest
on
support
side
would
not
be
the
same
type
of
interest
as
willingboro
can
show
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
your
client
also
wants
to
be
able
to
put
up
the
'sold'
sign
as
well
as
'for
sale'
sign.
are
you
defending
that
practice
too?
unknown
speaker
this
is
purely
commercial,
this
aspect
is
purely
commercial.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
that
essentially
happen
in
a
situation
in
which
the
real
estate
agent
or
agency
is
touting
itself,
so
i
think
is
responsible
for
the
sale.
unknown
speaker
isn’t
that
the
dominant?
unknown
speaker
but
you
apparently
in
response
to
my
brother
blackmun
question,
you
do
agree
that
there
are
some
interests
that
were
this
suppression
of
advertising.
unknown
speaker
so,
your
argument
is
there
are
some
interests
but
this
is
not
one
of
them.
unknown
speaker
your
equal
protection
clause
arguments
you
have
just
explained
to
us
that
it
is
–
this
ordinance
is
designed
to
have
racial
results.
you
do
not
make
an
argument
under
the
equal
protection
clause
that
this
ordinance
prohibits
the
display
of
“for
sale”
or
“sold”
signs,
but
does
not
prohibit
the
display
of
signs
containing
other
massages.
unknown
speaker
it
could
be
equal
protection.
unknown
speaker
i
am
recognizing
after
equal
protection
clause,
not
to
overbreadth
due
process.
does
willingboro
permit
signs
of
advertising
other
things,
giving
other
massages?
unknown
speaker
but
if
there
is
a
bakery
or
a…
unknown
speaker
how
about
a
residential
zone,
women
who
does
dress
making
for
example?
unknown
speaker
in
her
own
home,
with
her
own
needle
and
thread.
unknown
speaker
how
an
apartment
building
putting
up
a
‘for
rent’
sign,
one,
two,
three,
room
apartment.
unknown
speaker
but
they
are
not
committed
now.
unknown
speaker
are
the
apartments
and
building,
apartment
structures.
unknown
speaker
where
is
it?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
my
end
of
the
statement.
unknown
speaker
if
district
court
make
a
finding
about
the
fact.
unknown
speaker
but,
whatever
may
have
happened
in
your
community,
it
is
common
knowledge,
i
think
that
where
that
has
played
significantly
that
property
values
have
suffered
resulting
in
diminution
of
tax
revenues
for
the
community.
unknown
speaker
it
has
not
happened
in
this
community.
unknown
speaker
the
purposes
of
this
ordinance
was
preventing,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
to
prevent
rather
than
their
repair.
unknown
speaker
would
you
think
that
would
be
equally
--
or
would
you
think
if
the
arguments
included
in
this
prohibition
is
advertising
in
newspapers.
unknown
speaker
if
you
could
tell
me
one
thing
about
the
change
that
the
ordinance
brought
about,
does
the
evidence
tell
us
whether
there
has
been
a
change
in
the
actual
number
of
houses
being
offered
for
sale.
unknown
speaker
no
change
in
the
rate
of
sale
nor
in
the
rate
of
putting
houses
on
the
market.
unknown
speaker
what
does
the
ordinance
accomplish
then?
unknown
speaker
but
doesn’t
the
evidence
tend
to
indicate
if
the
rates
have
remained
constant
that
there
are
just
as
many
people
who
sold
on
account
of
fear
before
the
ordinance
as
they
were
after.
unknown
speaker
there
is
another
way
of
doing
it,
it
is
done
in
some
towns
by
putting
a
different
sign
up.
this
house
is
not
for
sale.
unknown
speaker
a
sign
saying
this
house
is
'not
for
sale',
it
would
also
violate,
it
will
also
be
impermissible.
unknown
speaker
right,
because
no
sign
is
permitted.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gottlieb,
let
me
ask
one
other
question
that
maybe
arisen.
on
this
30%
factor,
the
30%
of
the
sales,
only
30%
were
generated
by
the
'for
sale'
sign.
supposing
the
evidence
had
been
the
converse
and
30%
had
been
generated
by
a
local
newspaper
ads
and
70%
by
'for
sale'
signs,
could
the
township
had
banned
the
newspaper
ad?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
for
this
'for
sale'
sign,
does
the
record
tell
us
what
percentage
of
homes
were
for
sale
at
any
given
point
in
time.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
difference
between
the
'for
sale'
signs
and
the
newspaper
ads
than
the
practice
in
the
real
estate
business
is
to
list
sample
--
examples
of
houses
'for
sale',
never
listed
all
230
in
the
same
ad
or
anything
like
that.
so,
you
don’t
get
the
feeling
of
how
many
are
actually
on
the
market
at
any
one
time.
unknown
speaker
i
am
trying
to
understand
why
you
draw
distinction
between,
my
example
of
30%,
while
i
say
your
difference
is
based
on
the
fact
that
is
evidence
in
the
hearing
that
relates
to
sign,
there’s
no
evidence
in
hearings
relating
the
newspaper
ads.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gottlieb,
i
perceive
that
perhaps
you
have
already
answered
this
but
does
your
ordinance
touch
upon
political
advertising
rule?
unknown
speaker
so
they
were
in
the
midst
of
a
campaign,
i
can
conceive
of
some
political
signs,
it
would
accomplish
just
exactly
what
you
are
afraid
these
for
sale
signs
would
accomplish,
something
this
neighborhood
is
becoming
all
black,
electoral
segregationist
or
something
like
this.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gottlieb,
how
widespread
is
the
use
of
these
signs?
unknown
speaker
a
large
numbers
or
a
few…
unknown
speaker
mr.
gottlieb,
on
that
point,
you
mentioned
11,000
earlier
is
that
11,000
population
or
11,000
houses?
unknown
speaker
so,
that
if
we
had
230
signs
out
of
11,000
that
is
one
out
of
every
45
or
50.
unknown
speaker
even
if
it
was
twice
that
many,
it
would
be
one
out
of
every
25
houses,
is
that
of
course?
if
even
they
are
twice
as
many
as
230
that
would
be
one
out
of
every
25
houses.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gottlieb,
these
figures
came
from
the
people
who
support
the
ordinance,
right?
unknown
speaker
are
you
talking
about
the
number
of
signs.
unknown
speaker
well
do
you
have
any
to
contradict
that?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
figures
in
the
record
to
contradict
that?
unknown
speaker
but,
the
only
figures
we
have
a
200
in
this
record.
unknown
speaker
alright,
that’s
the
forest.
that
is
the
forest.
unknown
speaker
well,
since
november,
around
this
area,
we
have
had
a
all
other
signs
up
too.
should
we
panic?
unknown
speaker
well
since
the
change
of
administration…
unknown
speaker
there
have
been
a
lot
of
‘for
sale’
signs
in
every
neighborhood
in
this
town.
we
haven’t
granted
it.
we
are
uptight
about
it.
unknown
speaker
let
me
question
here,
absolutely
affective
alternate
means
of
communication
today,
now
you
are
suggesting
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
seller,
he
can
communicate
his
willingness
to
sell,
by
advertising
and
listing,
but
what
about
the
prospective
buyer
who
drives
into
a
neighborhood
and
says
i
may
move
in
to
this
block.
i
am
curious
to
know
how
many
people
are
selling,
is
it
a
stable
community,
or
it
is
one
that’s
changing?
how
does
he
get
the
message
that
he
would
get
if
there
were
signs
upfront?
unknown
speaker
but
does
the
records.
unknown
speaker
by
block,
he
get
all
the
homes
in
a
given
block.
unknown
speaker
is
it
as
easy
as
driving
around
the
street
in
the
car
on
a
sunday
afternoon.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
am
just
talking,
do
you
have
a
block
in
mind
that
you
are
interested
in,
you
want
to
know
how
many
houses
are
for
sale,
you
go
to
real
estate
agent,
it
is
basically
what
you
are
saying.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
don’t
suggest
that
all
homes
for
sales
or
all
those
listed
in
every
edition
in
the
newspaper.
unknown
speaker
but
you
suggest,
there’s
incomplete
information
is
perhaps
just
as
good
as
complete
information.
well
that’s
--
i
would
try.
unknown
speaker
but
the
challenge,
i
suppose,
is
that
there
are
different
people
buying
homes
who
might
buy
them
were
not
for
this
ordinances.
that’s
the
whole
purpose
of
the
ordinance,
is
that
the
hope
that
there
will
be
more
sales
to
whites
than
there
will
be
to
blacks.
unknown
speaker
or
it
is
that
there
wont
be
a
disproportionate
number
to
blacks,
would
be
a
more
accurate
way
to
put
it.
unknown
speaker
but,
what
were
they
still
afraid
of
then,
what
is
all
this
fear?
unknown
speaker
too
late
in
what
sense?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
they
are
afraid
that
value
of
their
property
will
substantially
decrease?
unknown
speaker
well,
willingboro
is
an
integrated
community
i
–
unknown
speaker
presumably,
people
who
live
there
are,
he
say,
i
do
not
like
it,
they
are
at
least
quite
willing
to
live
in
one,
i
think.
in
an
integrated
community,
you
mean
all
one
race
community.
unknown
speaker
a
predominantly
one
race.
unknown
speaker
and
that
if
you
walk
down,
where
is
this
place,
is
it
near
bordentown?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
i
knew
that
area,
i
have
never
hear
it.
unknown
speaker
it
is
just
15
minutes.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
have
you
went
through
it?
unknown
speaker
under
compulsion
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state,
regardless
of
what
the
ordinance
may
say
it's
clear
that
political
advertising.
unknown
speaker
willingboro
is
on
defendant
has
differ
to
that
decision
in
holiday.
