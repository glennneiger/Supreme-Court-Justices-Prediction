mr.
john
p.
hauch
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
petitioners
are
contending
the
designed
ordinance
of
the
township
of
willingboro
which
prohibits
‘for
sale’
signs
in
residential
premises
is
unconstitutional.
right
now,
if
you
live
in
willingboro,
and
you
desire
to
sell
your
home,
you
may
not
post
a
‘for
sale’
sign
on
your
property.
if
you
desire
to
engage
a
builder
to
aid
you
in
selling
your
home,
how
do
you
ignore
if
the
order
you
can
post
it
for
sale
sign
on
your
property.
the
justification
offered
by
the
township
is
not
the
‘for
sale’
signs
are
improper,
the
justification
is
that
the
township
council
has
a
fear
that
the
residents
of
the
community,
in
the
neighborhood
will
develop
what
is
called
a
psychological
fear,
this
being
by
seeing
homes
for
sale
in
your
neighborhood,
you
get
the
message
that
people
are
moving
out
and
in
turn,
this
might
lead
to
an
irrational
reaction
on
the
part
of
the
neighbors
and
they
might
rush
to
put
their
homes
in
market
and
rush
to
leave
the
town.
now,
mixed
in,
with
this
justification
is
the
thought
on
the
part
of
some
people
that
some
neighbors
may
feel
that
if
this
person
moves
out,
an
member
of
the
racial
minority
may
move
in.
so,
the
justification
primarily
is
based
on
a
frame
of
apprehension
and
fear,
yet
the
ordinance
bans
all
‘for
sale’
signs
on
residence
in
willingboro.
we
can
see
a
number
of
examples,
where
the
ban
would
be
totally
irrational
to
accomplish
and
of
keeping
fear
from
residents.
for
example,
the
person
that
is
transferred
in
their
employment
from
willingboro,
for
instance,
new
jersey
to
california
cannot
put
up
a
sign,
‘home
for
sale,
transfer,
have
black
in
the
community,
who
is
selling
may
not
put
up
a
sign,
house
for
sale,
black
moving
out,
that
certainly
would
not
create
the
fear
that
the
township
envisions
is
present
for
sale
signs.
similarly,
a
person
living
from
one
side
of
town
to
the
other
and
this
is
not
a
small
town,
it's
a
town
of
11,000
houses
could
not
put
up
a
sign,
‘house
for
sale
moving
across
town
but
not
out
of
town’.
and
the
basis
that
the
township
has
established
here,
i
think
leads
to
the
central
issue
in
the
case
and
that
is
whether
the
township
can
carry
its
heavy
burden
of
sustaining
that
this
ordinance
is
constitutional
and
does
not
abridge
the
freedom
of
speech
of
the
first
amendment
and
getting
to
this
posture
of
the
case,
the
court
of
appeals
by
two
to
one
decision
reverse
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
holding
that
the
ordinance
was
constitutional.
at
that
time
in
the
history
of
development
of
the
protection
for
the
commercial
speech,
the
court
of
appeals
only
had
the
initial
case
of
1942
of
valentine
against
christians.
it
had
subsequently
the
pittsburg
press
case,
which
upheld
a
prohibition
on
the
advertising
of
an
illegal
activity,
namely
the
sex
discrimination
and
employment
were
prohibited.
it
also
had
this
court’s
decision
in
bigelow
against
virginia
but
did
not
think
that
the
bigelow
decision
extended
far
enough
to
prevent
the
township
from
having
such
an
ordinance
ban
on
signs.
in
1976,
after
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
this
court
handed
down
its
opinion
and
the
virginia
state
board
of
pharmacy
case.
this
was
a
notable
announcement
of
free
protection
afforded
to
commercial
speech
because
among
other
things
and
probably
primary
as
far
as
society
is
concerned,
it
was
recognized
that
there
is
a
great
public
interest
in
having
the
free
flow
of
commercial
information,
it
maybe
indispensable
and
that
people
and
their
ordinary
individual
commercial
transactions
should
be
able
to
make
not
only
intelligent
but
well
informed
decisions,
they
should
not
be
kept
ignorant
of
facts,
they
should
not
be
pushed
by
other
means
to
get
facts
that
are
not
more
readily
available
by
the
message
thought
to
be
put.
the
analogy
with
the
virginia
state
board
of
pharmacy
case,
i
think
is
extremely
close
to
our
case.
there,
there
was
a
private
economic
transaction
and
was
a
case
of
extended
commercial
advertising
protection
to
a
product,
the
first
case
in
that
kind.
it
is
essential
obviously
that
price
which
was
consideration
in
the
virginia
pharmacy
case,
was
something
that
had
to
be
known
by
the
purchaser.
in
our
case,
the
supply
of
a
product
or
a
house,
the
availability
of
it
in
the
market
is
equally
essential
to
the
informed
and
intelligent
choice
of
a
buyer.
the
virginia
pharmacy
case
extended
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
not
only
for
the
benefit
of
the
advertise
but
also
for
the
benefit
of
the
person
receiving
the
advertisement
so
that
he
could
be
informed
and
make
intelligent
decisions
that
affect
his
daily
life
and
the
sale
of
a
house
is
a
vitally
important
thing
to
most
home
owners,
it
may
be
their
most
important
asset.
now,
the
situation
is
not
that
we
claim,
signs
cannot
be
regulated
of
this
nature,
obviously,
there
are
clear
areas
for
regulation,
namely
signs
cannot
be
false,
they
cannot
be
deceptive,
they
cannot
advertise
an
illegal
activity
as
indicated
by
the
pittsburg
press
case.
there
maybe
other
areas
of
regulations,
such
as
for
safety
and
for
health.
none
of
these
areas
were
involved
in
this
case.
township
comes
forth
with
no
justification
on
any
of
those
basis.
there
also
is
not
an
ordinance
framed
in
maintaining
in
the
community,
something
for
the
purposes
of
safety
such
as
traffic
ingestion
or
something
that
is
obnoxious
and
blaring
that
offends
the
senses
such
as
noise.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
i
would
say,
this
unconstitutional,
if
your
honor,
please,
if
i
may
give
an
example,
i
think
the
forbidding,
a
political
sign,
for
instance,
no
matter
how
small
could
be
regulated,
i
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
prohibit
a
political
sign
on
a
private
property.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
i
think
the
typical
billboard
sign,
if
it's
not
compatible
with
the
area
in
which
it
is
displayed,
such
as
national
beautification
of
highways
–
mr.
john
p.
hauch
absolutely
your
honor,
i
agree
with
that
whole
heartedly
and
i
would
say
this,
we
do
not,
in
this
case,
have
a
time,
manner
and
place
restriction.
we
have
a
censorship
of
the
message
itself,
it
is
prohibited.
the
time,
the
manner,
the
place
is
not
significant,
it
is
not
a
purpose
of
this
ordinance,
it's
just
a
complete
and
total
suppression
of
a
message
and
i
think
that
distinguishes
it
from
all
the
cases
including
the
american
mini
theatre
case
in
which
the
time
and
manner
may
be
recently
regulated.
we
do
not
contend
to
camp
it,
part
of
the
passage
of
this
repeal,
i
might
say
the
court
the
township
did
have
a
regulatory
scheme
for
signs.
it
embraced
at
least
two
facets,
one
facet
was
that
the
sign,
the
number
of
signs,
the
square
footage
of
the
signs,
the
time
when
after
which
they
have
to
be
removed
was
all
provided
by
this
ordinance,
reasonable
regulation
and
this
pertains
particularly
to
house
for
sale
signs.
in
addition,
it
is
notable
that
in
the
ordinance
in
sections
17
(3)
there
was
a
requirement
that
anyone
putting
up
a
sign
of
this
nature
or
any
other
nature
must
get
a
permit
from
the
building
inspect.
there
is
no
fee
charged
for
the
permit
in
connection
with
house
for
sale
signs.
that
was
the
regulatory
scheme
and
i
think
it
provided
adequate
means
for
monitoring
in
the
event,
it
was
any
fraud
of
illegal
activity
in
the
use
of
real
estate
signs,
which
is
not
on
this
record,
but
if
they
were,
the
legislation
certainly
would
provide
adequate
means
for
monitoring.
moving
on,
the
justification
upon
analysis
cannot
in
any
way
come
out
to
anything
except
a
totally
illogical
approach
to
how
to
achieve
the
stated
goals
of
the
township.
the
same
message
can
be
conveyed
for
sale
in
a
newspaper,
it
can
be
conveyed
in
a
broker’s
office,
in
a
multiple
listing
book
or
even
a
church,
by
neighbors
talking
or
a
social
function.
the
message
itself
is
what
the
township
wants
to
suppress
to
achieve
their
goal.
a
person
is
going
to,
if
we
follow
the
township’s
theory,
had
the
same
psychological
fear,
if
that
is
what
some
people
have
when
the
person
receives
a
message,
‘for
sale’,
because
that
message
says
people
are
moving
out.
whether
he
gets
that
message
through
a
sign
on
a
property,
a
newspaper
or
broker
or
a
neighbor
is
not
significant,
it
is
the
message
that
would
create
the
fear.
in
addition,
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
between
‘for
sale’
signs
on
property
and
other
possible
methods
of
advertising.
a
broker
requires
a
contract
in
most
cases
to
pay
your
fee
or
the
broker’s
commission.
a
newspaper
cannot
be
as
objective
because
the
purpose
of
advertiser
is
to
sell.
he
is
certainly
going
to
puff
the
property.
we
don’t
see
real
estate
ads
indicating
that
a
house
has
holes
in
the
roof,
or
things
of
that
nature.
so,
it
is
not
strictly
objective.
it's
hard
you
can
see
anything
more
objective
than
a
person
without
outside
influences,
driving
around
on
a
weekend
in
a
suburban
community,
and
seeing
a
sign,
and
seeing
the
house.
there
is
no
other
way
that
he
is
going
to
see
these
two
things
together
in
a
completely
objective
setting
as
far
as
he
is
concerned.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
if
your
honor
please,
the
ordinance
is
designed
to
cover
residential
property
as
one
area
of
sign
regulation.
there
are
also
separate
areas
of
regulation
with
respect
to
commercial
areas
and
industrial
areas.
the
design
of
the
ordinance
is
exclusionary
and
only
permits
of
exceptions.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
residential,
25
sherwood
drive,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
it
is
the
corporation
and
first
i
would
say
it
is
a
corporation
that
owns
this
property
and
circumstances
of
ownership
probably
would
seem
odd
and
have
some
setting.
my
understanding
is
it's
a
real
estate
company
that
holds
titles
that
come
out
of
foreclosure
until
they
can
be
disposed
off
in
a
reasonable
market.
there
is
no
charge
that
linmark
or
any
evidence
of
linmark
engaged
in
anyway,
in
any
illegal
blockbusting
activities
or
any
other
legally
offensive
activities
in
this
community.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
my
understanding
is
if
your
honor
please
that
when
there
are
foreclosures
rather
than
having
a
sale
at
a
distressed
price
in
a
foreclosure
proceeding,
quite
often
the
mortgagee
at
bank,
life
insurance
organization
or
fake
title
or
put
the
title
and
nominee
name
if
you
will,
until
a
reasonable
price
can
be
obtained
at
a
sale.
i
think
that
is
the
situation
here
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
well
that
is
its
business.
it
is
holding
these
titles
as
i
understand
it
after
acquiring
them
for
foreclosure
sales
until
a
reasonable
price
can
be
obtained
and
the
sale
made.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
general
real
estate
agent,
your
honor.
who
engages
in
business
in
this
township.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
i
don’t
believe
sir.
sir
cigarette
advertising
to
me
is
certainly
in
the
interest
of
public
health
which
is.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
yeah,
i
may
be
(inaudible)
but
it
isn’t,
yeah.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
yes,
arbitrary
your
honor
and
broadcasting
of
course,
the
licensing
situation,
a
private
homeowner
is
not
as
a
licensing
situation
so,
licensing
activity
certainly
can
be
much
more
be
regulated
as
would
be
the
case
with
the
realtors
but
not
with
the
individual
homeowner
or
only
'for
sale'
sign.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
we
are
not
defending
it
here
sir,
because
specifically
it
was
not
an
issue
as
such
but
i
would
say
that
the
practice
should
be
allowed
under
proper
regulation
to
indicate
the
information
the
property
has
been
sold.
now,
perhaps,
the
sign
is
removed
within
five
days
or
something
but
i
do
think
it
is….
mr.
john
p.
hauch
not
entirely,
your
honor,
please
because
it's
taking
a
property
off
of
the
market
which
i
think
would
be
equally
essential
to
somebody,
a
consumer,
who
is
interested
in
buying
a
property
in
the
area
but
this
property
was
sold.
it
does
have
some
element
of
informing
the
public
on
something,
that
they
should
have
the
right
to
know,
if
they
are
interesting
in
housing
market.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
that
is
an
element
of
that
and
would
not
be
known,
so
that
is
a
commercial
element.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
in
practiced
would
be
--
i
would
think
the
dominant
element
because
the
seller
no
longer
is
concerned.
it
is
a
commercial
element
but
i
wouldn’t
say
because
of
commercial
element
that
could
be
completed
prohibited.
moving
on….
mr.
john
p.
hauch
actually
you
only
get
it
as
public
health,
the
interest
in
public
health,
the
public
safety,
the
truth
no
deceptive
advertising.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
this
is
not
one
of
them
sir.
i
think
it
fails,
the
test
to
be
applied
in
number
of
respects,
one,
i
don’t
think
this
ordinance
proves
any
parameter
compelling
governmental
interest.
i
definitely
don’t
perceive
anything
that
is
incidental
about
the
regulation
of
suppression,
the
suppression
of
the
speech
to
any
valid
immediate
objective.
the
sole
objective
is
to
suppress
the
message
'for
sale',
so
that
you
suppress
an
apprehension
or
fear
and
i
don’t
know
of
any
case
that
is
held
that
it
is
proper
just
because
of
simple
fear
or
apprehension,
a
suppress
free
speech
and
it
would
be
horrible
if
it
happened
because
i
think,
just
in
times
of
controversy
such
as
of
indicated
by
the
township
here,
the
more
speech,
the
more
information
about
the
problem,
the
more
is
society
solving
the
problem.
also,
and
certainly
not
the
least
essential
way
of
accomplishing
this
in,
because
education
with
direct
suppression
is
not
just
a
restriction.
i
may
indicate
that
our
fourteenth
amendment
argument
is
primarily
based
on
a
finding
by
the
district
court,
that
there
was
an
improper
motive,
a
desire
of
the
township
officials
to
freeze
and
pass
discrimination,
we
are
relying
on
a
brief
of
that
argument.
i
think
the
important
thing
in
a
free
speech
case
today
that
has
commercial
advertising
is
to
consider
that
our
experience
with
government,
our
experience
in
society
is
that
secrecy
does
not
achieve
desirable
social
ends.
the
more
information
made
available
in
consumer
transactions
and
consumer
credits
and
disclosures
with
respect
to
equal
opportunity,
the
better.
we
get
better
answers
and
i
think
the
law
consistently
supports
that
view.
there
is
no
support
in
the
constitution
for
the
notion
that
the
people
are
kept
ignorant.
they
are
going
to
be
better
off
and
social
ends
are
going
to
be
achieved.
here,
i
think
it
is
irrational
to
believe
that
people
will
act
irrationally
if
they
are
given
the
full
facts
and
the
truth.
that’s
seems
to
be
the
approach
taken
by
the
township,
i
do
not
conceive,
it
is
support
by
the
law
or
will
achieve
social
end
desired.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
the
over
breadth
argument
was
not,
as
your
honor
please,
it
made
a
point
in
the
court
of
appeals…
mr.
john
p.
hauch
i
think
realization
of
that
came
up
in
some
very
recant
cases
of
this
court
of
an
over
breadth
and
they
will
be
although
we
have
not
urged
it,
because
we
did
not
urge
it
when
we
started
this
case
that
there
is
an
overbreadth
problem,
this
case
is
very
serious.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
i
think
your
honor
willingboro
permits
signs
advertising
a
use
that
is
may
on
the
property
such
as
a
business
that
is
on
a
property,
may
advertise
if
it
is
in
its
own
working
area
on
its
business.
it
does
not
allow
signs
that
advertise
off
premises
business.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
if
he
can
advertise,
if
he
is
in
a
commercial
zone,
own
his
property,
but
not
office
property
and
he
can’t
advertise,
if
he
is
a
branch
of
bakeries,
i
understand
if
they…
mr.
john
p.
hauch
dress
making
will
not
be
permitted
however…
mr.
john
p.
hauch
not,
according
to
the
way,
the
ordinance
is
drafted
because
it
is
non
exceptional,
made
point
after
all
exceptions
for
a
private
enterprise,
i
have
a
statement.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
‘for
rent’
signs
if
your
honor
please
fail
in
the
same
repealer
clause
as
be
'for
sale'
signs.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
no,
sir,
because
the
solution
was
both
‘for
rent’
as
well
as
‘for
sale’,
but
we
have
not
matched
first
the
main
point
but
they
are
in
exactly
same
categories.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
i
do
not
believe
they
are
of
any
significance.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
willingboro
is
midway
between
philadelphia
and
trenton?
mr.
john
p.
hauch
no,
it
is
and
it
is
a
very
large
area,
i
may
say
geographically.
the
answer
that
there
maybe
alternative
means,
i
think
there
is
no
argument
against
what
we
contend.
there
is
no
recognized
principle
that
because
you
want
to
give
a
massage
in
one
way
and
a
speaker
can
get
the
massage
in
another
way,
that
you
have
answered
this
suppression
that
violates
free
speech.
i
really
do
not
think
that
the
township
thus
far
in
this
case
has
come
forward
and
met
our
free
speech
argument
head
on
and
its
briefs.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
i
think,
they
are
looking
at
the
record
in
this
case,
during
a
period
uphold
and
through
1973,
when
signs
were
permitted.
the
evidence
is
and
no
one
contested
that
property
value
is
actually
increased.
there
is
no…
mr.
john
p.
hauch
the
district
court
made
a
finding;
they
did
not
decrease
for
any
period,
in
the
record,
even
the
trial,
members
of
township
council
testified
his
property
values
had
steadily
increased,
they
had
not
decreased
in
one
word.
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
assume
that
property
values
would
decrease
because
of
the
presence
of
the
signs.
i
think,
the
competition
that
was
showing
willingboro,
poor
homes
would
keep
the
price
up
and
obviously
part
of
that
is
there
are
homes
for
sale,
it
is
a
message.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
i
agree,
that’s
true
sir,
and..
mr.
john
p.
hauch
no,
it
has
not,
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
in
the
record
that
it
has.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
it
is
to
prevent.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
well,
it
say
definitely
is
i
suppose
to
prevent
rather
than
to
repair,
if
your
honor
please
and
the
means
to
prevent
are
illogical.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
just
like
to
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
enquiry
with
respect
to
the
record
on
the
ordinance
551
point,
there
are
in
a
residential
zone
permitted
specific
recreational
activities
of
a
private
nature,
i
am
referring
to
a-14,
page
of
the
appendix
which
contains
the
ordinance.
on
page
a-14,
in
section
6.4,
we
see
that
there
are
permitted
signs
advertising
a
golf
course,
county
club,
private
swimming
club.
i
suppose
that
would
include
swim
for
dollar
a
day,
marina,
(inaudible)
i
suppose,
that
would
include
for
both,
tennis
court
$2
an
hour,
$5
an
hour
to
play,
suppose
that
would
be
permitted
and
also
a
question
in
trials
advertising
private
stable,
and
suppose
you
advertise
a
‘stable
for
rent’.
so
the
permission
is
granted
to
some
private
activities,
i
wanted
to
clarify
the
record
on
that
point,
also
of
the
commercial
nature.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
when
the
supreme
court,
your
honor
it
was
a
trial
court
but
he
is
very
well
in
his
opinion
at
new
jersey.
mr.
john
p.
hauch
the
ordinance
does
not
say
so
but
they
have
certain
fact.
