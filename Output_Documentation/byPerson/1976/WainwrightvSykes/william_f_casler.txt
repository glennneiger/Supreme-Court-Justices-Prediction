mr.
william
f.
casler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
court
appointed
to
represent
john
sykes.
my
name
is
mr.
william
f.
casler,
i
am
from
st.
petersburg
beach,
florida.
first
of
all,
both
the
petitioner
and
amicus
have
totally
ignored
florida’s
rule,
a
very
specific
rule
that
has
to
do
specifically
and
only
with
suppression
of
confessions
and
admissions,
no
other
evidence.
we
have
other
rules
for
suppression
of
other
evidence,
our
rule
that
we
hear
on
today,
the
3.190
has
to
do
specifically
with
admissions
and
confessions
and
it
is
very
important.
this
rule
was
adopted
and
has
been
the
practice
of
florida
for
years
since
1919
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
case
steiner
v.
state.
the
rule
follows
that
case
law
and
not
only
that,
but
florida
is
adopting
july
1st
of
this
year
an
evidentiary
rule
which
follows
this
explicitly.
now,
this
rule
says
upon
motion,
it
is
in
my
brief,
both
the
federal
rule
and
the
state
rule
are
side
by
side
at
page
2
and
there
is
a
state
rule
and
on
page
3
is
the
federal
rule
and
they
are
totally
inconsistent
with
one
another
and
totally
distinguishable.
the
florida
rule
says
upon
the
motion
of
the
defendant,
and
then
it
says,
and
is
disjunctive.
it
says
or
upon
its
own
motion
the
court
shall
suppress
any
confession
or
admission
obtained
illegally
from
the
defendant
and
i
think
this
is
my
argument
to
the
district
court,
it
is
my
argument
to
fifth
circuit.
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
judgment
of
that
court,
the
opinion
of
that
court
followed
this
rule.
mr.
william
f.
casler
no,
sir
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
william
f.
casler
we
have
absolutely
nothing
in
our
rule
that
says
if
you
fail
to
do
this
defendant,
you
have
waived
anything.
mr.
william
f.
casler
a
confession
coming
in
and
admission
coming
in
is
enough.
the
court
shall
present
a
confession
or
admission
obtained
illegally
from
the
defendant,
now
how
does
the
court
know
that
unless
there
is
a
hearing
to
find
out
if
it
was
a
voluntary
confession?
mr.
william
f.
casler
alright,
this
is
a
practice
in
florida.
in
the
circuits
that
i
practice
in,
this
is
the
practice.
the
defendant,
if
he
does
not
do
anything
the
judge
has
a
hearing
automatically.
mr.
william
f.
casler
this
rule
came
in
1972.
this
defendant
went
to
trial
in
1972.
mr.
william
f.
casler
no
sir,
shortly
six
months
after
this
rule
went
in.
mr.
william
f.
casler
it
could
have
been,
i
do
not
know.
when
we
get
to
the
cases
on
this,
it
is
obvious
and
the
new
law,
the
new
evidentiary
rule
that
is
coming
in,
in
fact
well
if
you
will
turn
the
page
26
of
the
brief,
it
will.
in
july
1,
1977
this
year
--
now
this
is
a
legislative
act.
the
rule
was
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
integrated
bar
are
rule
3.190
was
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
now,
we
have
got
a
legislative
act
that
strengthens
the
rule
that
i
have
recited.
this
act
shall
apply
to
both
civil
and
criminal
cases
brought
after
the
effect
of
the
day
of
this
act.
nothing
in
this
section
shall
preclude
a
court
from
taking
notice
of
fundamental
errors,
affecting
substantial
rights
even
though
such
errors
were
not
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
judge.
mr.
william
f.
casler
the
way
i
construe
the
rule
and
our
rule
in
florida,
is
that
the
defendant
shall
do
this
on
his
motion.
or
the
judge
will
do
it
on
his
own
motion
to
see
that
no
admission
or
confession
comes
in
illegally.
mr.
william
f.
casler
i
think
that
is
a
good
point
and
i
think
that
is
exactly
where
it
should
be.
mr.
william
f.
casler
yes
sir.
mr.
william
f.
casler
because
the
case
law
says
that
on
page
19
of
my
brief
and
this
is
the
1919
case
and
it
is
still
a
law
of
florida.
it
had
been
followed
all
these
years.
it
is
present,
still
being
followed
and
it
is
a
basis
for
this
rule.
in
the
stand
of
this
state,
the
question
of
whether
admissions
or
confessions
are
made
freely
involuntary
for
the
court
to
determine,
to
enable
it
to
do
this
there
should
be
a
preliminary
investigation
by
the
court
and
this
examination
should
be
made
in
the
absence
of
the
jury.
while
we
think
it
is
best
for
counsel
to
interpose
objections
to
the
introduction
of
evidence,
of
admissions
or
confessions,
in
order
the
court
may
make
the
preliminary
investigation
to
determine
its
admissibility,
that
does
not
relieved
the
trial
judge
of
the
duty.
when
evidence
of
this
character
is
sought
to
be
introduced
to
satisfy
himself
that
the
admissions
were
freely
and
voluntarily
made
before
admitting
them.
mr.
william
f.
casler
well,
i
would
imagine,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
william
f.
casler
well,
i
think
it
probably
may
have
had
a
remarkable
foresight,
it
seems
quite
fair
to
me
what
i
have
just
said.
mr.
william
f.
casler
we
are
here
on
this
case
too,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
casler
all
i
can
say
is
that
there
was
error
in
the
sykes
case
that
should
have
been
done
this
way.
if
it
had
not
been
done
this
way,
we
would
not
be
here.
not
only
that,
if
florida
followed
this
rule
there
would
never
be
any
habeas
corpus
on
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession.
mr.
william
f.
casler
that
is
true.
mr.
william
f.
casler
and
if
you
do
not
say
it
the
judge
has
a
hearing.
mr.
william
f.
casler
that
is
true.
mr.
william
f.
casler
no,
sir,
no
your
honor.
but
if
you
fail
to
do
that
the
court
has
a
hearing.
mr.
william
f.
casler
no,
the
petitioner
was
giving
some
guidelines
and
i
am
giving
what
i
feel
are
guidelines
based
on
our
rule.
the
amicus
is
here
on
a
federal
rule
and
a
federal
rule
is
totally
different.
it
says
that
if
you
do
not
do
this,
it
is
waived
and
then
you
can
come
in
and
show
cause,
our
rule
does
not
say
that.
mr.
william
f.
casler
yes.
mr.
william
f.
casler
yes,
i
am.
mr.
william
f.
casler
and
i
am
saying
that
is
what
the
rule
says
and
does
and
that
is
why
our
circuit
follows
this.
mr.
william
f.
casler
i
am
arguing
this
to
counter
what
the
amicus
curiae
has
said,
they
are
trying
to
relate
federal
rule
12
to
what
we
were
operating
on.
mr.
william
f.
casler
yes
sir.
mr.
william
f.
casler
it
was
violated
by
allowing
a
confession
to
come
in
without
any
determination
that
anytime,
anywhere
as
to
voluntariness
of
that
confession.
mr.
william
f.
casler
yes,
i
do.
mr.
william
f.
casler
i
would
absolutely.
mr.
william
f.
casler
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
f.
casler
that
is
true.
mr.
william
f.
casler
i
consider
this
rule
the
confession
and
admission
coming
in
no
different
than
the
waiver
of
a
jury
trial
or
anything
else.
mr.
william
f.
casler
when
they
are
witness
and
they
take
the
fifth
amendment
if
you
are
asking
the
question.
mr.
william
f.
casler
that
is
possible.
i
have
never
asked
the
defendant,
do
you
want
to
take
the
fifth
amendment,
when
in
a
trial,
i
do
ask
him
whether
or
not
they
want
the
confession
to
come
in
and
if
they
do
we
go
to
the
judge
and
we
tell
the
judge.
mr.
william
f.
casler
what
sir?
mr.
william
f.
casler
i
will
file
a
motion
to
suppress
five
weeks
before
trial
or
the
day
i
get
it.
i
file
a
motion
to
suppress.
mr.
william
f.
casler
no,
i
would
not.
mr.
william
f.
casler
i
might
have
tried
it,
it
would
not
have
worked,
your
honor.
in
our
circuit
the
judge
would
have
a
hearing.
mr.
william
f.
casler
never,
if
this
is
a
supreme
court
of
florida
case.
mr.
william
f.
casler
the
steiner
case,
the
1919
case.
mr.
william
f.
casler
the
defendant
from
jail,
from
prison
filed
a
motion
to
vacate
with
the
trial
judge.
it
was
denied,
no
opinion.
he
filed
a
habeas
corpus
with
the
district
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
district
in
lakeland,
florida.
it
was
denied
with
an
opinion.
the
opinion
said
we
already
considered
these
matters
when
it
was
here
for
appeal.
he
filed
a
habeas
corpus
with
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
it
was
denied
and
said
they
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
i
do
not
know
why.
mr.
william
f.
casler
only
that
they
denied
habeas
corpus
because
they
lacked
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
f.
casler
yes,
but
not
on
this
point.
the
attorney
that
handled
the
trial
was
appellate
council
and
he
did
raise
this
on
appeal.
subsequent
to
that
time
after
the
defendant
from
prison
filed
a
motion
to
vacate
with
the
trial
judge,
then
he
went
back
to
the
district
court
that
handled
the
appeal
and
did
a
habeas
corpus
and
the
court
entered
a
very
short
opinion
denying
it
and
said
that
had
been
considered
on
appeal.
then
he
went
to
supreme
court
of
florida
and
they
denied
it
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
f.
casler
he
has
been
sentenced
10
years,
he
has
been
in
prison
six
years,
he
is
supposed
to
be
out
within
six
months.
i
suppose
so.
mr.
corces
was
giving
guidelines
to
the
court.
i
cannot
see
why
there
is
not
an
automatic
hearing
and
there
would
be
no
habeas
corpuses
for
voluntariness
in
any
district
court,
in
any
federal
district
court,
it
would
have
been
done.
i
just
cannot
see
why
this
cannot
be
done
in
a
trial
court
automatically
and
there
would
be
no
problem.
mr.
william
f.
casler
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
f.
casler
that
is
true.
the
federal
rule,
i
am
not
going
to
delve
into
that,
but
it
is
totally
different
from
our
rule.
it
has
to
do
with
the
suppression
of
all
evidence.
this
rule
had
resided
that
the
court
has
to
do
specifically
only
and
with
confession
as
drawn
with
particularity.
the
federal
rule
has
to
do
suppression
of
all
evidence.
it
also
refers
to,
not
automatically
it
is
waived
if
you
do
not
raise
it.
we
have
nothing
in
our
rule
to
show
this
at
all.
now,
getting
to
the
--
mr.
william
f.
casler
i
do
not
know
why
the
counsel
trial
did
not
raise
this
issue
at
trial.
i
do
not
know
why
he
did
not
raise
this
issue
on
appeal.
i
know
that
when
i
was
appointed
in
the
district
court,
i
went
to
the
rule
immediately
because
that
was
the
practice.
in
the
fifth
circuit
i
went
to
the
rule
immediately.
at
the
fifth
circuit
in
my
opinion
is
correct.
they
say
that
there
is
a
responsibility
and
the
trial
judge
could
have
a
hearing.
mr.
william
f.
casler
now
that
was
in
the
same
counsel
that
handled
the
trial
did
the
appeal
and
that
was
in
1972
when
this
rule
came
in,
whether
he
knew
the
rule
or
did
not
know
the
rule,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
william
f.
casler
it
could
have
been,
i
really
do
not
know.
mr.
william
f.
casler
now
in
florida,
mr.
corces
says
that
if
you
do
not
raise
this
issue
in
florida
then
you
have
waived
it.
you
cannot
bring
collateral
attack.
there
is
a
myriad
of
cases
that
i
have
cited
o
my
brief
on
page
15
and
16
that
are
contrary
to
this.
the
florida
holding
is
a
procedural
default
of
failing
to
appeal
is
not
equivalent
to
an
expressed
waiver
of
a
constitutional
right
and
will
not
preclude
collateral
attack
of
an
unlawful
conviction.
i
am
not
going
to
read
all
these
cases
they
all
say
the
same
thing
that
holding
that
failure
to
object
at
the
trial,
to
a
denial
of
a
fundamental
right
does
not
act
as
a
procedural
default
to
stop
collateral
attack.
it
is
not
necessary
for
defendant
to
object
at
trial
at
all.
there
are
at
least
10
to
15
cases
on
page
15
and
16
that
hold
that.
mr.
william
f.
casler
i
do
not
know.
mr.
william
f.
casler
except
that
the
statement
that
he
made
does
not
tie
into
self
defense
at
all
as
the
fifth
circuit
pointed
out
the
facts.
in
their
opinion
it
said
that
the
facts
of
what
he
--
mr.
william
f.
casler
no
question
about
it,
he
said
“i
shot
him”
and
then
he
went
into
a
long
detail
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
self
defense
in
the
confession.
mr.
william
f.
casler
absolutely.
mr.
william
f.
casler
that
is
correct.
the
habeas
in
the
appellate
court
of
florida
is
the
district
court
in
lakeland.
the
defendant
did
file
there
from
jail
his
own
motion
with
that
court.
that
court
did
enter
an
opinion
that
had
cited
in
the
brief
and
said
that
they
had
already
considered
this.
that
is
what
the
opinion
says.
now,
the
petitioner
and
the
amicus
have
pointed
out
that
the
district
court
that
made
that
opinion
made
a
mistake.
well,
i
do
not
know
whether
the
district
court
made
a
mistake
in
that
opinion
or
not.
mr.
william
f.
casler
yes,
appeal
the
denial
of
state
habeas,
no.
the
defendant
went
to
the
district
court
of
florida
and
then
he
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
then
he
filed
in
the
district
of
court
of
the
federal
government,
the
united
states
district
court.
that
is
when
i
was
appointed.
mr.
william
f.
casler
up
until
that
time
he
had
no
counsel
whatsoever
in
his
habeas
proceedings?
mr.
william
f.
casler
yes.
mr.
william
f.
casler
denied
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
that
is
all
the
statement
that
was
in
the
opinion,
denied
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
f.
casler
you
mean
to
the
federal
court?
mr.
william
f.
casler
that
was
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
mr.
william
f.
casler
the
district
court
of
appeals
is
a
lower
court.
mr.
william
f.
casler
well,
they
have
made
a
ruling
and
entered
an
opinion
and
denied
it.
then
it
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
which
is
the
highest
court,
they
summarily
denied
it
saying
they
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
f.
casler
absolutely.
mr.
william
f.
casler
did
i
prepare
it?
i
prepared
it
in
the
--
mr.
william
f.
casler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
casler
i
explained
to
him
what
the
competency
was
of
an
attorney,
and
what
the
competency
was
not.
mr.
william
f.
casler
the
judge
hodges,
a
district
court
judge
in
tampa.
mr.
william
f.
casler
federal
district
court,
told
that
defendant
that
without
that
he
had
to
go
back
to
the
state
courts
and
he
said,
“i
am
not
going
back
to
state
courts,
i
have
been
in
jail
two
years.”
mr.
william
f.
casler
he
said
i
am
not
going
back
to
the
state
courts
and
i
said,
“we
are
going
to
wait,
judge
hodge
is
going
to
let
you
come
in
here
as
to
sign
a
stipulation
that
you
are
competent
with
a
counsel”
and
i
explained
to
him
what
he
was
doing.
he
decided
to
do
that.
mr.
william
f.
casler
yes,
but
i
do
not
know
if
he
had
not
made
the
statement
the
statement
that
he
made.
mr.
william
f.
casler
yes,
i
do
certainly.
but
there
again,
i
feel
that
it
would
have
to
be
that
the
statements
were
voluntarily
made
not
coursed
or
taken
under
some
other
circumstances,
but
then
the
statements
could
have
been
used.
the
fact
of
procedural
default,
i
have
set
out
as
best
i
could
with
all
the
cases
in
the
state
of
florida
that
we
just,
the
cases
that
relate
to
the
procedural
default,
i
do
not
believe
i
have
anything
more
to
say.
thank
you.
