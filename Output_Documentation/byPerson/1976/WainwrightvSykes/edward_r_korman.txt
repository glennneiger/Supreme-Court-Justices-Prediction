mr.
edward
r.
korman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
ultimate
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
a
defendant
who
was
failed
to
comply
with
a
state
procedural
rule
which
gives
him
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
raise
a
claim
that
his
confession
was
obtained
without
compliance
with
this
court’s
holding
in
miranda.
they
simply
march
into
a
federal
court
at
his
pleasure
and
obtained
habeas
corpus
relief
in
a
new
trial.
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
before
detailing
our
position
on
this
issue
to
speak
to
the
facts
of
this
case
in
a
little
bit
more
detail
and
there
were
two
points
i
wanted
to
deal
with.
first,
there
is
this
inconsistency
between
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
and
the
order
of
the
district
court.
the
district
court
remanded
this
case
for
florida
to
hold
a
full
blown
hearing
on
the
issue
of
voluntariness
of
the
confession,
what
described
as
jackson
v.
denno
hearing.
the
court
of
appeals
in
affirming
said
that
the
state
of
florida
need
only
provide
a
hearing
going
to
the
issue
of
whether
miranda
had
been
complied
with.
there
is
some
confusion
in
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion.
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
seem
to
suggest
that
had
the
trial
court
initially
on
its
own
ordered
a
jackson
v.
denno
hearing
then
counsel’s
attention
might
have
been
more
specifically
drawn
to
this
issue
and
he
might
have
raised
the
claim
on
his
own.
in
light
of
this,
i
think
it
is
important
to
take
a
brief
look
at
what
happened
at
the
trial
of
this
case.
the
evidence
was
fairly
simple.
willie
gilbert
was
shot
to
death.
i
think
it
was
on
january
8,
1972,
within
minutes
after
the
crime
was
committed
the
police
arrived
at
the
defendant’s
home.
willie
gilbert
was
laying
about
10
feet
from
the
door
of
the
defendant’s
house.
the
defendant’s
wife
came
running
up
to
the
police
and
she
said
john
shot
willie.
a
few
minutes
later
the
defendant
walked
up
to
the
police
and
he
said
“i
shot
willie.”
they
placed
him
under
arrest
and
he
was
then
taken
into
the
police
station
and
interrogated.
at
the
trial,
the
issue
of
miranda
was
quite
evident
the
defense
lawyers
specifically
on
cross
examination
of
the
police
officer
listed
the
exact
warnings
that
were
given.
he
asked
whether
the
defendant
was
intoxicated
at
the
time.
he
did
everything
except
make
a
formal
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
on
the
grounds
that
miranda
had
not
been
complied
with.
now,
they
may
very
well
have
been
reason
for
this
on
the
record
in
this
case
because
if
you
read
the
transcript,
if
you
just
read
the
states
case
alone,
without
consideration
of
the
confession
there
is
an
overwhelming
case
at
least
on
the
charge
for
which
the
defendant
was
convicted
which
is
a
kind
of
manslaughter
charge
which
in
florida
is
denominated
as
murder
on
the
third
degree.
the
state
did
not
need
his
confession
on
its
case
in
chief
prove
his
guilt.
the
confession
became
relevant
only
in
light
of
his
defense.
that
is
the
defendant
was
required
in
this
case
and
the
defendant’s
lawyer
knew
it,
and
everybody
else
knew
it
that
to
take
the
stand
and
make
out
a
case
based
on
self
defense
and
that
is
were
his
confession,
his
incriminatory
statement
became
particularly
pertinent.
now,
since
there
was
no
claim
that
this
confession
was
involuntary
in
the
traditional
sense
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
of
the
trial
to
indicate
that
this
confession
was
involuntary
in
the
traditional
sense,
presumably
counsel
may
have
been
aware
that
once
the
defendant
took
the
stand
in
this
case
that
statement
whether
miranda
was
complied
with
or
not
could
have
been
used
to
impeach
the
credibility
of
his
self
defense
testimony.
and
there
may
very
well
have
been
counsel
may
very
well
have
felt
that
what
is
the
point
of
making
an
objection
on
the
state’s
direct
case,
when
the
evidence
is
going
to
come
in
anyway,
when
i
put
my
client
on
the
stand
and
he
is
impeached
by
his
prior
confession.
and
what
happens
in
the
case
like
this
if
the
court
says
that
in
these
circumstances
a
defendant
can
nevertheless
obtain
habeas
corpus
relief.
as
in
another
case
arising
in
a
similar
context
there
will
be
absolutely
no
reason
for
defense
counsel
to
object.
he
could
figure
“well,
it
is
going
to
come
in
anyway
on
the
defense
case,
i
will
not
object
on
the
prosecution’s
case,
they
will
impeach
his
credibility
and
i
would
try
for
the
acquittal,
but
if
not
i
could
always
go
into
federal
court
and
obtain
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.”
i
think
in
the
context
of
what
happened
here
and
the
manner
in
which
this
confession
could
have
been
used
and
in
which
counsel
may
have
anticipated
it
could
have
been
used,
he
simply
may
have
felt
that
it
would
be
pointless
to
raise
an
objection
on
the
direct
case.
and
as
in
this
context
that
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
issue
of
whether
he
can
now
come
in
to
a
federal
court
and
obtain
habeas
corpus
relief
without
ever
having
complied
with
a
reasonable
state
procedural
rule.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes,
the
confession
indicated
there
had
been
some
altercation
that
the
defendant
had
lost
his
temper
and
just
shot
him,
shot
the
victim.
it
was
quite
clear
from
the
confession,
which
we
set
out
at
page
5
in
our
brief
that
it
was
not
self
defense
and
of
course
it
would
have
been
admitted
to
impeach
his
credibility
regardless
of
whether
the
miranda
was
complied
with.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
am
not
certain
she
testified
as
a
defense
witness.
she
was
not
terribly
helpful
because
she
said
that
she
did
not
see
the
shooting.
she
was
not
clear
as
to
the
events
which
preceded
it.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
believe
that
she
did
mr.
chief
justice.
i
believe
that
she
did.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that
is
right
and
even
if
she
had
not
testified
that
statement
might
have
been
admissible.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
never
any
question
that
he
shot
him.
that
is
why
i
say
that
it
may
have
been
understandable
why
the
defendant’s
lawyer
did
not
raise
the
issue.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
of
course
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
before
he
was
placed
under
arrest,
which
would
trigger
then
the
miranda
issue,
he
had
walked
up
shortly
after
his
wife
had
said
that
john
shot
willie.
he
admitted
himself
that
i
shot
willie
without
any
qualifying
self
defense
explanation
for
it.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that
is
right
the
warnings
came
when
he
was
questioned
at
the
station
house.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
he
was
originally
charged
with
murder
in
the
second
degree.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
not
first
degree,
it
was
an
unintentional
killing
as
what
he
was
originally
charged
with
and
he
is
convicted
that
was
an
even
lesser
degree
of
an
intentional
killing.
and
he
was
sentenced
to
ten
years
of
which
he
has
now
served
five
and
the
question
becomes
why
should
he
now
be
entitled
to
habeas
corpus
relief?
after
this
court
decided
davis
v.
unites
states,
which
held
that
knowing
and
deliberate
waiver
standard
did
not
apply
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
were
the
defendant
fail
to
comply
with
the
reasonable
procedural
rule
12(b)(2)
which
dealt
with
defects
in
the
institution
of
the
prosecution.
the
court
and
i
think
it
is
critical
that
it
was
after
davis
gave
this
construction
to
rule
12(f)
and
in
the
context
of
a
habeas
corpus
case,
this
court
amended
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedures
that
is
promulgated
an
amendment,
which
added
to
the
motions
that
must
be
made
before
trial
or
be
deem
waived
all
suppression
motions.
and
that
procedural
rule,
which
this
court
promulgated,
did
not
simply
go
into
effect
by
congressional
inaction.
congress
affirmatively
adopted
and
approved
that
amendment
and
so
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
absence
cause
to
relieve
him
from
the
waive
of
provision,
a
federal
prisoner
could
not
come
into
a
federal
court
and
get
this
relief
after
davis
and
after
the
amendment
of
rule
12(b)-3
and
we
think
it
is
equally
clear
as
a
result
of
this
court’s
opinion
in
francis
v.
henderson
that
a
state
prisoner
cannot
do
any
better
than
a
federal
prisoner
what
have
in
the
face
of
a
reasonable
state
procedural
rule.
and
mr.
justice
white
raised
the
question
of
what
would
constitute
cause
to
relieve
the
defendant
from
the
waiver
provisions.
and
we
believe
that
cause
means
prejudice
in
the
sense
of
his
right
to
a
fair
trial.
in
the
sense
that
the
habeas
corpus
statute
is
really
intended
to
deal
with,
that
is
to
ensure
that
an
innocent
man
is
not
confined
to
prison.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that
is
right
and
to
deal
with
your
point
with
respect
to
counsel,
we
think
that
the
reason
that
counsel
was
provided
and
i
think
you
have
to,
when
you
answer
the
question
about
the
inadequacy
of
counsel
claim
that
counsel
will
raise
it
because
it
is
inadequate.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
in
the
perspective
of
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that
is
right
and
of
course
your
honor,
to
develop
in
this
questioning
there
was
no
plain
error
here.
you
cannot
look
at
the
record
in
this
case
and
say
that
there
was
any
error.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
that
is
right.
we
think
that
the
same
test
of
prejudice
is
what
that
he
lose
as
a
result
of
the
failure
of
his
counsel
to
make
this
objection,
regardless
of
the
reason
for
it.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that
is
right
because
i
think
there
are
other
values
that
entered
the
picture
when
you
are
dealing
with
motions
that
are
made
years
after
the
trial
which
could
have
been
made
earlier
and
the
question
then,
particularly
when
you
are
dealing
with
the
state
procedural
rule
is
what
did
you
lose,
as
a
result
of
counsel’s
inadequacy.
you
lost
the
right
to
exclude
statement
that
was
taken
without
full
compliance
with
miranda,
but
was
the
statement
coerced
in
the
traditional
sense,
no.
was
it
unreliable,
no.
well,
then
why
then
should
we
not
give
some
consideration
to
questions
of
finality.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
think
that
also
weighs
in
the
scale
in
this
particular
case
because
i
think
aside
from
the
stipulation
that
the
defendant
made
that
he
was
not
claiming
his
counsel
was
inadequate.
i
think
it
suggests
that
counsel
may
have
made
a
deliberate
decision
and
i
think
and
i
would
reiterate
that
this
court
would
now
hold
and
i
do
not
know
whether
in
this
case
counsel
made
a
deliberate
decision.
if
i
were
to
guess
i
would
say
he
did
not,
but
if
this
court
would
now
hold
that
in
a
case
just
like
this,
federal
habeas
corpus
is
available
then
there
would
be
no
incentive
for
the
defense
lawyer
to
make
the
objection
because
he
knows
it
has
got
to
come
in
anyway
to
impeach
the
credibility
of
his
defendant.
if
the
defendant
does
not
take
the
stand,
he
is
surely
going
to
be
convicted.
so
why
make
the
motion
if
you
could
not
get
another
crack
at
the
apple
pie
by
obtaining
habeas
corpus
rule.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
believe
that
he
did.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
it
has
been
a
little
bit
of
time
since
i
read
the
complete
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well
the
defendant
said,
i
believe
in
his
confession
that
gilbert
came
into
his
trail,
was
playing
around
with
the
gun,
he
told
him
to
put
the
shotgun
down
so
willie
put
it
down
and
went
into
the
yard.
respondent
said
in
his
confession
that
he
followed
him
out
to
the
yard
that
willie
turned
around
and
patted
his
butt
at
him
like
this
and
then
shot
him,
which
is
completely
inconsistent
with
the
testimony
that
we
have
set
out
at
page
7
and
8
in
our
brief
in
which
he
purports
to
claim
that
he
was
afraid
that
he
shot
him
because
he
was
afraid
that
he
was
going
to
come
running
back
at
him
and
attack
him
in
some
way.
i
mean
they
are
completely
inconsistent.
there
is
just
one
more
point
that
i
would
want
to
make.
we
would
not
necessarily
be
making
the
same
argument
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
make
this
point
if
we
were
dealing
with
the
claim
that
the
confession
was
involuntary
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
this
was
a
traditional
involuntariness
argument.
because
in
cases
like
that
there
is
always
the
element
that
an
involuntary
confession
may
be
unreliable
and
so
that
when
you
get
into
the
context
of
a
claim
of
true
involuntariness
then
another
question
arises,
perhaps
that
an
innocent
man
maybe
convicted.
in
that
context
we
would
think
that
if
there
was
no
other
evidence,
except
the
coerced
confession,
which
was
the
case
in
fay
v.
noia.
there
was
a
coerced
confession
obtained
by
the
most
blatantly
improper
and
unconstitutional
means.
there
was
not
a
shred
of
other
evidence
in
the
case.
then
we
would
think
that
that
might
be
an
appropriate
case
to
excuse
a
procedural
default
and
perhaps
florida
would
under
those
circumstances
as
well.
i
think
that
particularly
apposite
here,
and
we
quoted
at
length
in
our
brief
as
this
court’s
opinion
in
jenkins
v.
delaware.
if
you
will
recall
in
johnson
v.
new
jersey
the
court
said
that
miranda
would
be
applied
retroactively
to
all
trials
which
took
place
after
the
date
of
its
decision.
in
jenkins
v.
delaware,
the
court
said
well
that
did
not
apply
to
retrials
where
the
conviction
had
been
reversed
after
miranda.
and
the
defendant
was
scheduled
to
be
tried
again
and
the
reasons
that
the
court
gave
are
really
the
basic
reasons
why
we
believe
that
habeas
corpus
should
be
denied
in
this
particular
context.
and
that
is
the
court
said
that
when
the
trial
had
not
yet
commenced,
it
was
relatively
close
in
point
of
time
to
the
date
that
the
crime
was
committed.
that
law
enforcement
officers
could
attempt
to
reconstruct
their
case
while
memories
were
still
fresh.
but
when
you
were
dealing
with
a
conviction
that
was
reversed
probably
years
have
gone
by,
much
more
difficult
to
reconstruct
the
case
particularly
where
the
prosecutor
had
relied
on
the
confession
as
an
essential
part
of
this
case,
so
that
the
court
said
for
these
reasons,
even
though
miranda
applies
to
trials
that
took
place
after
the
date
of
the
holding,
we
are
not
going
to
apply
it
to
retrials.
and
those
same
underlying
considerations
of
policy
apply
equally
here.
but
the
court
said,
the
defendant
can
still
take
advantage
perhaps
of
the
rule
that
if
they
could
show
that
his
confession
was
truly
involuntary.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
then
maybe
he
can
get
relief
and
that
is
the
basic
analysis
here.
so
that
i
think
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
granting
habeas
corpus
relief
in
the
context
of
the
case
like
this.
i
wonder
mr.
chief
justice
if
i
could
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
some
rebuttal.
