justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
first
of
these
cases,
wainwright
versus
sykes
is
granted
certiorari
in
view
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
respondent
sykes
was
convicted
of
third
degree
murder
after
a
jury
trial
in
the
circuit
court
of
desoto
county,
florida.
among
the
evidence
indicating
that
sykes
had
shot
one,
willie
gilbert
in
the
front
yard
of
sykes'
trailer
home
was
a
statement
which
sykes
gave
to
the
police
shortly
after
the
shooting
and
after
full
miranda
warnings.
there
was
no
objection
to
the
admission
into
evidence
at
or
before
the
time
of
trial
as
required
by
a
florida
rule
of
criminal
procedure.
the
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
florida
appellate
courts.
sykes
then
filed
a
present
federal
habeas
action
advancing
the
miranda
claim.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
right
to
hearing
on
a
voluntariness
of
a
confession
is
guaranteed
by
our
earlier
decision
in
jackson
against
denno.
they
also
held
that
notwithstanding,
not
the
failure
to
comply
with
the
florida
objection
rule,
respondent
could
raise
his
constitutional
claim
in
the
federal
habeas
proceeding.
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
the
case
to
the
state
court
for
a
hearing
on
sykes'
his
constitutional
claims.
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
an
opinion
file
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
the
deliberate
bypass
test
articulate
this
court's
opinion
in
fay
against
noia
is
not
the
proper
test
for
determining
the
availability
of
federal
habeas
review
in
this
case
or
direct
review
of
the
miranda
question
was
--
would
be
barred
by
failure
to
comply
with
the
state
timely
objection
rule.
the
proper
test
in
one
which
gives
more
weight
to
the
integrity
of
state
procedural
rules,
we
think
is
the
one
set
forth
in
francis
versus
henderson
decided
last
year,
which
allows
federal
habeas
review
of
such
claims
only
upon
a
showing
of
cause
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
state
rule
and
prejudice
resulting
from
the
alleged
underlying
color
of
constitutional
violation.
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
we
have
no
difficulty
concluding
that
neither
cause
nor
prejudice
have
been
shown
and
therefore,
respondent,
sykes,
was
not
entitled
to
raise
this
claim
for
the
first
time
in
federal
habeas
proceedings.
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
stevens
have
filed
concurring
opinions.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
marshall
has
joined.
