mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
this
honorable
court.
my
name
is
charlie
corces,
jr.
appearing
in
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
wainwright
in
this
cause.
this
case
involves
the
recurring
problem
of
the
procedural
default
and
its
affect
on
subsequent
habeas
corpus
proceedings
in
federal
court.
the
court
granted
certiorari
on
two
cases,
on
two
points:
1)
whether
the
failure
to
challenge
the
admissibility
of
an
out
of
court
statement
at
or
before
trial
should
preclude
habeas
relief
of
a
habeas
petitioner’s
volunteering
his
claim
at
subsequent
habeas
proceedings.
and
2)
whether
or
not
jackson
v.
denno
mandates
a
voluntariness
hearing
where
the
admissibility
of
a
confession
is
not
challenged.
mr.
sykes
was
charged
in
florida
with
second
degree
murder.
he
proceeded
to
trial
and
during
the
course
of
this
trial
certain
inculpatory
statements
were
introduced
in
evidence
against
him.
florida
has
a
procedural
rule
specifically
rule
3.190
of
the
florida
rules
in
criminal
procedure,
which
require
that
a
pre-trial
motion
to
suppress
any
confessions,
which
is
claimed
or
alleged
were
illegally
obtained
be
made
or
at
least
that
an
objection
be
made
at
trial.
but
in
this
case
counsel
for
sykes
neither
filed
his
pre-trial
motion
nor
objected
to
the
admissibility
of
any
of
the
statements
during
the
course
of
the
trial.
mr.
sykes
was
convicted
of
murder
in
the
third
degree,
a
lesser
offense.
he
appealed
his
conviction.
in
his
appeal
he
did
not
raise
the
issue
of
the
voluntariness
of
these
admissions.
the
only
issues
he
raised
on
appeal
were
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
two
other
questions
pertaining
to
instructions
as
to
second
degree
murder
and
instructions
as
to
self
defense.
the
appeal
was
affirmed.
the
first
time
that
mr.
sykes
raised
the
issue
pertaining
to
the
voluntariness
of
his
admissions
or
inculpatory
statements
was
in
post
conviction
proceedings,
filed
a
post
conviction
proceeding
in
the
trial
court
in
the
nature
of
habeas
corpus.
but
in
florida
a
matter
that
was
known
to
a
criminal
defendant
and
what
should
have
and
could
have
been
raised
at
the
trial
level
and
on
direct
appeal
cannot
be
raised
collaterally.
so
naturally
this
was
denied.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
no,
sir
and
in
fact
in
the
habeas
hearing
in
the
district
federal
court,
he
executed
a
written
waiver
of
any
contention
that
his
state
trial
or
appellate
counsel
was
incompetent.
so
here
we
have
no
question
of
incompetency.
competency
of
state
trial
and
appellate
counsel
has
been
conceded.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
i
think
that
the
florida
appellate
courts
would
have
denied
the
point.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
i
think
just
about
anything
is
subject
to
a
plain
error
where
it
is
clear
in
the
record
your
honor
that
they
maybe
for
instances,
you
may
have
a
completely
course
confession.
that
if
the
testimony
comes
up
that
it
was
beaten
out
of
the
defendant.
i
know
the
probability
would
be
plain
error,
yes
sir.
we
do
not
have
that
situation
here.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
no,
sir
the
proceedings
in
state
court
were
flushed
out
on
the
pleas.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
all
the
facts
that
we
have
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
no,
sir
his
claim
of
voluntariness
is
the
officers
gave
him
his
miranda
rights.
his
claim
is
that
he
was
intoxicated
and
did
not
understand
them
and
of
course,
florida
was
never
put
on
notice.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
yes,
sir
because
the
state
was
never
able
to
focus
on
the
issue
of
voluntariness
on
whether
or
not
he
understood
his
miranda
rights.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
at
the
trial
there
was
testimony
that
he
was
intoxicated.
he
testified,
“i
drunk
a
little.”
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
no,
sir
he
did
not
link
it
all
to
that
claim.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
he
is
claiming
that
he
did
not
understand
the
miranda
warnings
because
he
was
too
intoxicated
to
understand
them.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
that
is
correct
sir.
it
gave
florida
90
days
to
conduct
a
jackson
v.
denno
hearing.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
no
sir,
there
is
no
plain
error
apparent
on
the
phase
of
this
record.
as
i
stated
out
or
said,
mr.
sykes
subsequent
to
having
his
petitions
denied
in
state
court
filed
a
petition
in
the
federal
district
court
for
the
tampa
division.
that
court
held
that
mr.
sykes
was
not
bound
by
his
procedural
default
and
gave
florida
90
days
within
which
to
conduct
a
jackson
v.
denno
hearing,
but
on
the
florida
procedure
it
cannot
be
conducted
so
the
state
of
florida
sought
and
obtained
permission
to
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit.
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
stating
that
it
is
incumbent
upon
a
trial
judge
to
conduct
a
jackson
v.
denno
hearing
even
though
an
admission
or
an
inculpatory
statement
is
not
challenged.
and
further
that
in
as
much
as
florida
had
not
proven,
place
the
burden
on
florida,
that
florida
had
not
proven
that
the
procedural
default
was
a
tactical
decision
by
mr.
sykes
that
he
was
not
bound
by
the
procedural
default.
we
submit
that
both,
the
federal
courts,
the
district
court
in
the
fifth
circuit
were
in
error.
i
would
like
to
make
it
clearly
understood
to
the
court
that
we
do
not
question
the
power
of
a
federal
district
court
to
consider
federal
claims
even
when
there
has
been
a
procedural
default.
we
are
talking
about
the
appropriate
exercise
of
that
power
on
the
principles
of
comity,
federalism
and
the
appropriate
administration
of
criminal
justice
where
state
has
a
procedural
rule
and
we
submit
that
principles
of
comity
and
federalism
require
that
federal
courts
forego
habeas
relief
where
a
petitioner
has
committed
an
inexcusable
procedural
default
resulting
in
the
failure
to
develop
the
historical
facts
contemporaneously
with
the
timely
presentation
of
the
claim.
now,
i
submit
that
in
such
cases
denial
of
relief
should
be
the
rule
instead
of
the
exception.
and
i
fully
recognize
that
this
may
conflict
somewhat
with
what
the
court
said
in
fay
v.
noia.
but
it
conflicts
with
the
dicta
in
fay,
it
does
not
conflict
with
the
holding
in
fay
because
in
fay,
as
i
understand
the
case,
there
was
a
timely
objection
at
the
trial
level.
in
fay,
as
i
understand
the
case,
the
historical
facts
were
developed
at
the
trial
level.
in
fay
what
occurred
was
that
the
procedural
default
was
in
failing
to
appeal
but
the
historical
facts
were
developed,
they
were
there
form
an
appellate
court
to
understand
them
and
in
fact
if
i
recall
in
fay,
the
state
conceded
that
the
confession
had
been
coerced
and
in
fay
in
fact,
there
was
an
intentional
bypass.
in
fay
there
was
an
intentional
bypass,
but
this
court
found
that
it
had
been
coerced.
in
other
words,
there
was
cause
for
failing
to
appeal,
which
brings
me
to
what
i
would
submit
to
this
court
are
the
appropriate
guidelines,
which
have
already
been
enunciated
by
this
court
in
davis
v.
the
united
states
and
that
is
that
when
there
is
a
state
procedural
rule,
when
it
is
reasonable
and
when
it
has
a
legitimate
state
interest
that
a
procedural
default
of
that
rule
should
preclude
subsequent
habeas
relief
where
there
has
been
a
default
and
that
default
has
resulted
in
the
failure
to
develop
the
historical
facts.
unless
and
until
such
time
as
the
habeas
petitioner
demonstrates
not
only
cause,
but
actual
prejudice.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
davis
guidelines
are
fair
to
both
sides.
they
provide
a
criminal
defendant
with
a
federal
forum
so
that
vindication
of
his
constitutional
rights,
at
the
same
time
it
shows
proper
deference
to
state
procedural
rules,
which
are
promulgated
to
give
him
the
very
constitutional
rights,
which
he
seeks
to
protect
and
florida
has
a
rule,
a
criminal
procedure
rule
that
gives
him
as
jackson
vs.
denno
hearing,
all
he
has
to
do
is
ask
for
it.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
there
is
no
cause
at
least
none
has
been
alleged.
he
has
waived
any
contention
that
his
trial
counsel
or
appellate
counsel
was
--
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
that
would
not
be
sufficient
under
estelle
v.
williams
your
honor.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
no,
sir
it
would
not
be
sufficient
under
estelle
v.
williams.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
yes,
sir,
but
i
think
once
we
have
in
that
counsel
we
have
a
separate
constitutional
claim.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
i
think
you
have
the
rule
to
consider
the
entire
case
and
determine
whether
in
viewing
the
entire
case
he
was
reasonably
effective
counsel.
and
of
course
if
he
was
not
a
reasonably
effective
counsel
considering
probable
tactical
decisions
and
when
i
say
by
probable
tactical
decisions,
i
use
the
objective
standard
not
these
subjective
standard.
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
sufficient
for
counsel
to
come
in
five
years
later
and
say
i
did
not
know.
if
there
is
a
probable
tactical
decision
that
it
could
have
been
based
he
is
not
incompetent.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
yes,
sir
i
think
plain
error
would
always
be
an
exception.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
i
would
think
so,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
well,
since
it
is
a
federal
constitutional
question
i
would
say
it
would
depend
on
the
federal.
what
is
a
federal
plain
error
standard,
what
this
court
would
--
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
yes,
sir
if
he
does
not
object.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
i
would
assume
that
would
be
a
determination
for
the
trial
court
whether
based
on
all
the
evidence
his
intoxication
was
such
that
he
could
not
understand.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
i
would
say
that
that
would
not
be
admissible.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
if
it
please
the
court
the
davis
approach
caused
an
actual
prejudice
as
i
stated
is
fair
to
both
sides.
it
also
requires
a
criminal
defendant,
it
forces
a
criminal
defendant
to
make
his
constitutional
assertions
timely
so
the
state
can
focus
on
the
particular
issue
and
this
case
points
out
exactly
what
i
am
talking
about.
whether
or
not,
he
was
so
intoxicated
that
he
could
not
understand
his
miranda
warnings,
if
the
state
is
not
put
on
notice
to
this
issue,
they
cannot
focus
their
evidence
on
the
issue
unless
they
put
on
notice
as
to
this
issue
and
unless
he
is
forced
to
make
his
claim
in
a
timely
manner,
then
the
state
is
forced
to
contest
this
issue
maybe
years
later
when
he
raises
it
in
federal
court.
it
also,
if
it
pleased
the
court,
it
tends
to
simplify
federal
habeas
proceedings
because
by
forcing
a
criminal
defendant
to
take
advantage
of
a
state
procedural
rule,
which
would
develop
the
historical
facts
it
would
make
federal
habeas
proceedings
a
lot
easier.
all
that
they
would
need,
federal
district
courts
would
need
is
a
transcript
of
what
occurred
in
state
court
to
determine
the
constitutional
issues.
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
in
this
case
the
respondent
sykes
has
demonstrated
neither
cause
nor
prejudice
and
that
the
decisions
of
the
lower
courts
were
in
error.
now,
as
to
point
two
jackson
v.
denno,
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
jackson
v.
denno
mandates
a
voluntariness
hearing
even
in
the
absence
of
a
challenge
to
the
confession.
i
find
it
to
be
a
curious
ruling
by
the
fifth
circuit
because
in
1972
the
rule
completely
otherwise
in
a
very
similar
case
to
this
one.
that
one
involved
a
federal
prisoner
and
they
ruled
that
jackson
v.
denno
did
not
mandate
a
voluntariness
hearing.
in
randall
v.
state
cited
in
the
brief
of
petition,
the
fifth
circuit
relies
on
this
court’s
decision
in
sims
v.
georgia.
but
in
sims
v.
georgia
there
was
a
specific
motion
to
suppress
filed
by
the
defendant
seeking
to
suppress
his
confession.
whether
or
not
this
court
has
specifically
ruled
on
this
point
i
do
not
believe
it
has.
however,
i
have
noticed
that
in
all
the
opinions
that
have
been
written
they
carefully
stake
challenged
confessions
as
recently
as
michigan
v.
moseley
and
as
recently
as
brewer
v.
williams
the
confession
was
challenged.
to
require
a
trial
court
on
its
own
initiative,
to
conduct
a
jackson
v.
denno
hearing
is
then
require
the
trial
judge
to
interfere
with
the
defense
of
the
case.
there
maybe
many
reasons
why
even
the
defense
would
want
an
inculpatory
statement
in
evidence.
it
may
contain
defensive
matter.
“yes,
i
killed
him
but
in
self
defense”,
he
may
not
want
to
take
the
witness
stand.
to
establish
self
defense
in
his
confession
may
establish
it
for
him,
it
may
contain
matters
pertaining
to
insanity,
which
he
would
rather
not
take
the
witness
stand
and
rely
on
the
confession
that
comes
in
to
evidence.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
that
maybe
true
your
honor,
but
again
if
it
is
done
during
the
course
of
the
trial
it
is
interfering
with
defense,
the
defense
may
not
want
the
state
to
focus
on
the
problem,
it
maybe
as
in
this
case
intoxication.
he
maybe
claiming
using
intoxication
as
mitigation
and
by
raising
the
issue
it
would
allow
the
state
to
focus
on
what
his
true
defense
is
such
as
intoxication.
unless,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
court
has
any
further
questions
it
is
all
that
i
have.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
may
i
clarify
a
couple
of
things
to
this
court?
first
the
rule
of
procedure
has
been
in
florida
since
1968
not
1972.
it
is
cited
in
the
brief
as
1972
rule,
but
that
rule
has
been
in
effect
in
florida
since
1968,
but
since
every
year
florida
seems
to
publish
the
rules
of
procedure
i
cited
as
a
1972
rule.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
yes,
sir
it
is
cited
in
the
briefs.
one
other
point,
i
have
went
through
every
case
cited
by
the
respondent
in
his
brief.
there
is
not
one
case
that
holds
that
it
is
not
a
waiver
if
you
fail
to
object.
not
one
case.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
henry
v.
mississippi?
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
but
in
henry
v.
mississippi,
i
believe
this
court
remanded
for
a
determination
as
to
whether
--
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
by
counsel?
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
well,
sir
i
submit
that
to
that
extent
the
better
guideline
is
in
these.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
well,
it
is
the
same
question
in
a
way
i
think.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
so
far
as
counsel
was
concerned
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
no
sir,
it
was
direct
certiorari,
direct
habeas.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
it
is
an
adequate
state
ground
question,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
corces,
jr.
yes
sir,
fay
v.
noia
says
that
detentions
implicit
is
efficient.
