unknown
speaker
is
he
raising
an
issue
of
ineffective
assistance
with
the
counsel?
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
had
attempted
to
raise
the
issue
on
appeal
not
having
raised
it
at
trial?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it
the
rule
in
florida
you
must
raise
your
evidentiary
objections?
unknown
speaker
is
that
subject
to
a
plain
error
exception
in
florida?
unknown
speaker
did
his
claim
in
collateral
proceedings
require
flushing
out
with
the
hearing
and
did
it
rest
on
facts
outside
the
record
that
have
already
been
made?
unknown
speaker
so
that
all
the
facts
are
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
voluntariness?
unknown
speaker
so
that
his
claim
does
not
depend
on
anymore
facts
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
mr.
corces
do
you
mean
at
the
trial
he
did
not
make
any
claim
that
he
was
intoxicated.
unknown
speaker
did
he
link
that
to
a
claim
that
because
of
that
intoxication
he
did
not
understand
the
warning?
unknown
speaker
mr.
corces,
let
me
focus
on
this
because
some
of
your
comments
have
confused
me
a
little
bit.
maybe
i
should
ask
this
question
of
your
opponent.
is
the
respondent
claiming
that
what
he
said
was
involuntary
or
is
he
claiming
that
he
did
not
understand
the
miranda
warnings?
unknown
speaker
i
think
personally
there
is
a
distinction
between
those
two
and
you
feel
that
it
is
the
latter.
unknown
speaker
if.
your
opponent
does
not
agree
maybe
he
can
help
me
out.
unknown
speaker
mr.
corces
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question
because
i
am
not
quite
sure
of
how
you
answered
one
of
mr.
justice
white’s
questions.
as
i
read
judge
simpson’s
opinion
for
the
fifth
circuit,
that
court
ordered
the
state
to
conduct
an
evidentiary
hearing.
that
would
suggest
to
me
that
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
feel
that
the
state
record
contained
all
of
the
evidence
necessary
to
determine
this
new
claim.
unknown
speaker
anyway
if
collateral
proceedings
were
open
as
much
as
direct
appeal
proceedings
are
to
plain
error
claims.
there
would
not
be
a
plain
error
apparent
on
the
phase
of
this
record.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
this
case
there
would
it
not
be
a
much
question
if
prejudice
was
there.
unknown
speaker
and
how
about
cause?
unknown
speaker
you
are
talking
about
guidelines
what
if
the
prisoner
or
his
counsel
just
simply
said
that
i
did
not
realize
the
statement
might
be
objectionable?
unknown
speaker
just
a
plain
mistake.
unknown
speaker
but
i
suppose
your
guidelines
would
permit
the
claims
of
inadequate
counsel.
unknown
speaker
but
i
suppose,
well,
it
is
a
separate
constitutional
claim,
but
i
suppose
this
sort
of
approach
would
put
a
good
deal
of
pressure
on
developing
a
more
discernable
rule
about
the
inadequacy
of
counsel.
do
you
think
it
ought
to
be?
how
would
you
state
it?
counsel
says,
i
just
made
a
mistake,
i
should
have
objected
but
i
did
not.
is
that
enough?
unknown
speaker
and
would
your
guidelines
permit
plain
error
exceptions
to
the
rules.
unknown
speaker
so
if
the
counsel’s
failure
was
plain
enough
or
his
mistake
was
plain
enough
on
the
record
you
would
ignore
the
mistake
unknown
speaker
you
would
apply
ordinary
plain
errors
standards
whatever
they
are?
unknown
speaker
would
the
plain
error
standards
depend
on
the
state
plain
error
standards?
unknown
speaker
in
reviewing
federal?
unknown
speaker
mr.
corces,
can
i
ask
you
a
question.
supposing
the
prisoner
when
he
was
taken
into
custody
was
given
his
miranda
warnings
by
the
arresting
officer
and
he
responded
by
saying
i
have
just
had
two
quarters
of
gin,
i
do
not
know
what
you
are
talking
about
and
all
i
know
is
i
am
sorry
i
killed
this
person
of
course
to
that
affect.
pretty
clearly
he
did
not
understand
the
warnings,
but
he
is
making
an
inculpatory
statement.
would
that
be
admissible?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
his
counsel
objected
to
the
trial,
would
the
trial
judge
let
that
statement
in?
unknown
speaker
yeah
assume
he
could
not
understand
the
warnings.
unknown
speaker
it
would
not
be
admissible.
unknown
speaker
but
even
if
the
fifth
circuit’s
rule
is
right
in
this
case
that
the
trial
judge
must
initiate
the
inquiry
and
the
voluntariness
i
presume
the
defendant
could
still,
if
he
felt
the
way
you
have
just
described.
tell
the
trial
judge,
“no,
i
do
not
want
a
hearing
on
voluntariness,
i
waived
that
issue.”
unknown
speaker
mr.
korman,
will
you
refresh
me
a
little
bit
on
the
facts
that
the
confession
was
used
in
the
direct
case
and
of
course
it
acknowledged
the
shooting.
was
there
something
in
the
confession
inconsistent
with
the
self
defense
theory
is
that
the
point?
unknown
speaker
in
florida,
was
the
testimony
of
the
wife
admissible
against
the
husband
or
not?
unknown
speaker
it
is
pretty
difficult
for
her
to
avoid
it
or
at
least
to
open
the
door
to
have
the
policeman
testified
that
she
said
so.
unknown
speaker
mr.
korman,
there
was
never
any
question
that
he
shot
him.
unknown
speaker
but
her
testimony
simply
that
john
shot
him
without
anymore
any
explanation
might
tend
to
undermine
his
self
defense.
unknown
speaker
the
warning
came
afterwards.
unknown
speaker
what
was
his
charge?
unknown
speaker
no,
it
was
first
degree.
unknown
speaker
you
do
differ
then
with
your
colleague.
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
not
open
up
habeas
corpus
to
claim
their
claims.
unless
it
went
to
integrity
of
fact
finding.
unknown
speaker
when
your
counsel
claims
would
be
subject
to
the
same.
unknown
speaker
and
even
if
any,
who
should
have
known
enough
to
object
if
there
is
no
indication
of
the
evidence
is
unreliable
there
should
be
no
federal
habeas.
unknown
speaker
you
put
in
the
scales
the
fact
that
you
suggested
earlier,
the
statement
was
inevitably
going
to
come
in
once
the
defendant.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
impeachment
point
you
made
earlier.
did
in
fact
the
prosecutor
use
the
statement
to
impeach
the
defense
testimony?
unknown
speaker
he
did,
he
did
not
mention
any
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
your
brief
does
not
identify
a
contradiction
between
the
defense
testimony
and
the
statement.
you
say
it
might
have
been
used
for
the
purpose,
but
i
did
not
find
it
in
the
brief.
unknown
speaker
does
not
that
assume
that
someone
is
going
to
call
the
trial
judge’s
attention
to
the
matter
by
an
objection?
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
preclude
the
judge
from
acting
on
his
own,
but
you
suggest
that
there
is
no
consequence
of
the
failure
to
draw
the
matter
to
the
court’s
attention.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
not
it
at
least
suggest
that
there
has
to
be
some
evidence
produced
before
the
judge
which
would
motivate
him
to
act
on
his
motion?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
said
in
just
the
words
you
recited
you
might
have
a
pretty
good
argument
as
i
read
it,
it
does
not
say
in
quite
those
words.
unknown
speaker
why
did
not
the
judge
not
have
a
hearing
on
this
case?
unknown
speaker
before
the
rule
came?
unknown
speaker
you
say
the
rule
was
just
too
new
for
the
judge
to
know
about
it.
unknown
speaker
does
that
tell
us
very
much?
you
do
not
need
a
rule
or
a
statute
to
have
the
judge
have
authority
to
take
notice
of
something
that
he
thinks
affects
the
fairness
of
the
trial.
it
does
not
say
the
judge
shall
hold
a
hearing
as
i
thought
you
admitted,
that
he
shall
not
be
prevented
even
in
the
absence
of
a
motion
from
acting
on
his
own.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
casler,
why
have
the
motion
by
the
defendant
at
all
if
the
judge
is
obliged
to
do
it?
unknown
speaker
i
am
asking
the
question,
you
said
the
judge
must
do
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
does
the
rule
say
upon
motion
of
the
defendant
or
the
judge?
why
not
just
say
the
judge
will
do
it.
unknown
speaker
of
course
in
a
1919
case,
i
presume
the
supreme
court
of
florida
was
talking
about
voluntary
confessions
in
a
traditional
non-coerced
sense,
rather
than
just
in
terms
of
confessions,
which
were
made
without
proper
miranda
warning.
unknown
speaker
it
would
have
had
remarkable
foresight,
let
us
say,
if
they
have
been
talking
about
the
last.
unknown
speaker
that
has
not
been
the
rule
in
florida
since
1919.
what
happened
about
the
chambers’
case
that
came
to
this
court
where
we
had
put
that
rule
in
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
back
in
1919
and
i
want
you
to
bring
you
a
little
closer
to
the
chambers’
case.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
under
the
florida
rule
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
say
one
word,
two
words,
“i
object.”
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
florida
said?
unknown
speaker
florida
says
the
only
thing
necessary
to
get
a
hearing,
a
full
blown
hearing,
is
to
say
“i
object.”
unknown
speaker
and
it
would
be
too
much
to
expect.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
arguing
mr.
casler
that
the
constitution
requires
the
judge
to
hold
a
hearing
on
his
own?
is
that
argument
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
us
see,
are
you
saying
that
looking
at
page
3
of
your
brief,
subdivision
3
of
your
state
rule,
the
court
shall
receive
evidence
and
the
issue
of
fact
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
now
are
you
saying
that
under
your
rule,
the
practice
has
been
and
is
that
whenever
the
government
or
state
offers
an
admission
or
a
confession
automatically
the
trial
judge
must
say,
“stop,
we
will
have
a
hearing
out
of
the
present
situation?”
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
your
rule
means?
unknown
speaker
are
you
arguing
this
just
to
explain
why
he
did
not
object
or
are
you
arguing
that
there
is
a
federal
constitutional
requirement
that
a
judge
absent
any
objection
conduct
a
hearing,
which
are
you
arguing?
unknown
speaker
what
has
either
approach
got
to
do
with
our
question
here
is
whether
the
federal
constitution
has
been
violated,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
how
was
it
violated
here?
unknown
speaker
so
do
you
argue
that
this
constitution
requires
the
judge
to
hold
a
hearing
on
his
own
absent
any
objection?
unknown
speaker
well,
now
do
you
think
in
this
kind
of
a
case
anyway,
if
you
tie
the
objection
of
the
constitution
you
would
say
this
is
contrary
to
the
fifth
amendment
if
you
were
objecting,
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
and
that
it
say
that
it
is
compelling
a
person
to
testify
against
himself?
unknown
speaker
normally,
in
any
trial
you
make
a
person
claim
his
fifth
amendment
objection,
you
always
do,
do
you
not?
if
he
thinks
he
is
coerced
into
making
an
incriminating
statement,
he
should
stay
his
objection,
that
is
a
normal
fifth
amendment
rule,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
why
should
it
be
any
different
here?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
this
is
a
fifth
amendment
case.
this
is
a
fifth
amendment
objection
and
normally
you
make
people
claim
their
privilege.
unknown
speaker
well,
no
that
person
is
claiming
his
privilege,
would
be
claiming
his
privilege
not
to
have
his
own
statements
used
against
him.
unknown
speaker
in
your
own
practice
have
you
tried
cases
and
the
state
offers
an
admission
or
confession,
what
do
you
do?
you
personally,
what
do
you
do?
unknown
speaker
in
your
own
practice
in
the
state
offers
a
confession
or
an
admission,
what
do
you
do?
unknown
speaker
you
would
do
what
this
trial
judge
or
this
trial
lawyer
did
that.
unknown
speaker
even
if
you
knew
that
you
were
going
to
put
your
man
on
the
stand
and
testify
and
under
harris
v.
new
york,
he
could
be
impeached
with
it.
unknown
speaker
now,
you
have
been
talking
about
the
1919
florida
case.
did
this
case
go
to
the
supreme
court,
to
the
appellate
review
in
florida?
unknown
speaker
which
case?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
appellate
review
of
the
case
we
are
arguing
here
today
before
you
went
to
federal
habeas
corpus?
unknown
speaker
under
florida
law
has
not
the
highest
court
of
florida
said
something
about
this
case
that
is
subsequent
to
1919?
unknown
speaker
whether
the
district
court
of
appeal
considered
the
case
on
direct
appeal.
unknown
speaker
along
your
theory
mr.
casler,
suppose
this
man
had
been
sentenced
to
35
years
and
you
came
in
25
years
after
the
trial
with
exactly
the
habeas
corpus
that
we
have
for
us
now.
your
argument
is
that
the
federal
court
should
do
just
what
it
did
here
even
after
25
years.
this
is
only
five
years,
is
not
it
now?
unknown
speaker
except
you
say
the
rule
required
the
florida
court
to
do
it
automatically
and
they
did
not
do
it.
unknown
speaker
so
even
if
the
state
were
to
provide
what
you
say
it
has
provided
by
rule,
if
the
trial
court
failed
to
follow
the
rule
there
would
still
federal
habeas.
unknown
speaker
mr.
casler
when
your
present
plans,
the
plan
where
you
are
appointed
to
represent
here,
when
he
went
into
the
subsequent
proceedings
after
trial,
he
has
never
called
the
attention
of
any
court
until
now
to
what
you
claim
is
the
florida
rule.
does
that
mean
that
his
counsel
on
trial
and
his
separate
counsel
on
appeal
was
not
aware
of
what
you
say
is
the
florida
practice?
unknown
speaker
two
other
florida
lawyers
whom
your
client
has
stipulated
to
have
been
effective
counsel
apparently
were
not
aware
of
this
practice
or
the
rule.
unknown
speaker
he
might
have
realized
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
him
to
explain
to
the
court
why
he
did
object.
maybe
that
was
a
reason
he
did
not
raise
it
on
to
you.
unknown
speaker
what
we
speculated.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there
should
be
a
different
approach
to
this
kind
of
case
where
there
was
no
challenge
to
the
commission
of
the
act
so
that
is
the
shooting,
but
only
on
plea
and
confession
and
avoidance
that
is
self
defense?
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
a
perfectly
logical
thing
for
a
man
who
is
going
to
say
“yes,
i
shot
him
but
i
did
it
in
self
defense,”
to
fail
to
object
to
the
policeman
testifying
to
his
statements.
unknown
speaker
what
self
defense
assumes
an
admission
of
having
performed
the
act
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
what
the
state
courts
did
here
are
contrary
to
cases
that
you
cited
at
the
bottom
of
page
15?
should
the
state
courts
have
entertained
a
collateral
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
how
are
we
to
understand
the
state
law
here
when
apparently
the
latest
announcement
of
state
law
is
that
such
claims
that
are
not
presented
at
trial
are
not
available
on
state
habeas,
which
is
what
happened
here.
unknown
speaker
you
appeal
the
denial
of
state
habeas?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
but
did
he
take
his
state
habeas
claim
to
the
state
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
the
hearing
was
denied?
unknown
speaker
did
it
go
to
an
intermediate
court?
unknown
speaker
no,
did
it
go
to
an
immediate
appellate
court?
did
it
go
to
the
florida
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
it
went
to
the
district
court
of
appeals
too,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
justice
white
is
referring
by
an
intermediate
state
appellate
court.
unknown
speaker
your
claim
certainly
includes
an
assertion
that
the
florida
courts
did
not
follow
the
controlling
florida
law.
unknown
speaker
mr.
casler,
did
you
negotiate
the
stipulation
that
trial
counsel
who
also
took
the
appeal,
i
understand
on
direct
review,
i
was
confident.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
did
you
negotiate
it?
did
you
advise
your
client?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
why
would
you
have
not
been
on
the
case
before,
why
would
you
want
to
stipulate
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
federal
district
court.
unknown
speaker
you
exhaust
state
remedies
on
his
counsel.
unknown
speaker
you
acknowledged
that
on
rebuttal
or
on
cross
examination
of
the
defendant
after
he
had
taken
stand
that
his
statements
could
have
been
established
under
harris
v.
new
york
by
way
of
impeachment.
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
government
had
not
put
in
these
admissions
to
the
police
in
its
case
and
chief.
do
you
agree
when
he
once
took
the
stand
the
state
could
impeach
him?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
do
with
henry
v.
mississippi?
unknown
speaker
that
was
a
procedural
default
at
the
trial,
claimed
default
at
the
trial.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
rule,
what
was
the
basis
for
its
remand?
the
basis
for
its
remand
was
that
it
must
be
determined
whether
there
was
deliberate
bypass.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
do
with
that?
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
for
you
to
win
you
have
to
chew
up
henry
v.
mississippi
a
little
bit?
you
said
you
did
not
need
to
overrule
a
holding
of
noia,
now
how
about
henry?
well,
i
think
henry,
if
it
please
the
court,
was
primarily
concerned
with
the
adequate
state
ground.
henry
was
concerned
--
unknown
speaker
i
thought
henry
said
that
the
problem
with
the
fact
situation
was
you
did
not
know
if
there
was
a
little
bypass
or
not.
in
fact
but
the
rule
was
still
delivered
bypass.
if
my
memory
serves
me,
ultimately,
the
mississippi
supreme
court
found
that
there
had
not
mention.
unknown
speaker
but
was
henry
a
habeas
case?
unknown
speaker
that
is
state
ground
question.
unknown
speaker
which
fay
v.
noia
said
was
a
different
situation?
