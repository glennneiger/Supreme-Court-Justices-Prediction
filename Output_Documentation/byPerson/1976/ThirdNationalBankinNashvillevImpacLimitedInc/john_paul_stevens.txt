justice
john
paul
stevens
will
you
somewhere
along
the
line
answer
this
question
and
that
is,
whether
respondent
impact
instead
of
being
a
mortgagee,
it
simply
owned
the
piece
of
land
and
your
client
sent
out
of
bulldozer
and
started
excavating
on
the
land
and
the
respondent
objected
and
your
client
said
that
we
are
starting
our
new
branch
office
here
and
the
respondent
said
well,
gee!
i
have
never
sold
it
to
you
and
it
turned
out
to
be
simply
a
mistaken
identity
on
the
part
of
your
client.
would
the
tennessee
courts
be
disabled
by
the
section,
you
are
relying
from
issuing
an
injunction
in
that
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
under
your
theory,
would
they
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
then
it
is
simply,
literally,
no
injunction
in
whatever
circumstances
conceivable,
at
least
you
say
it
could
be
prospective.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
it
could
be
quite
important,
could
it
not
because
if
you
read
the
section
of
the
statute
you
are
relying
on
is
used
in
generous
type
i
think,
attachment
and
execution
are
both
remedies
prior
to
judgment,
initiated
by
a
plaintiff
and
certainly
you
could
read
this
word
injunction
is
being
so
limited.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
have
to
go
as
far
as
was
suggested
in
the
case
of
the
bulldozer
and
mistakenly
on
the
wrong
property?
do
you
have
to
say
the
statute
would
go
that
far
in
order
to
support
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
business
relationships
and
business
transactions
and
documents
upon
which
your
proceeding
has
distinguished
from
the
other
which
is
a
trespass,
i
would
take
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kanaday,
what
in
the
statute
draws
a
distinction
between
a
breach
of
contract
claim
and
a
tort
claim?
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
but
if
you
concede
that
the
statute
does
not
apply
literally
in
that
situation,
are
you
not
saying
that
in
some
cases
it
is
read
literally
and
in
some
cases
it
is
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
one
could
distinguish
between
tort
and
contract,
could
one
also
not
distinguish
as
your
opponent
does,
between
cases
in
which
the
plaintiff
is
a
creditor
and
those
in
which
he
is
a
debtor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
procedure
for
the
bank
in
this
case
for
closing
on
its
security?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
takes
no
official
participation,
it
takes
no
participation,
it
is
not
a
judicial
foreclosure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
is
not
in
any
kind
of
public
official?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
at
the
sale?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
at
no
time
in
the
whole
foreclosure
procedure,
is
there
any
official
participation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
your
capacity
you
have
the
same
responsibility
i
suppose
on
constrictions
as
a
public
official,
do
you
not?
are
you
responsible
to
a
court
for…
justice
john
paul
stevens
automatic
judicial
review.
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
we
agree
with
you
except
for
the
constitutional
issue
that
is
presented
here,
do
we
have
to
face
that
or
must
we…
justice
john
paul
stevens
why?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
respondent
now
wants
to
sustain
the
judgment
on
constitutional
ground.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kanaday
am
i
correct
though
that
your
argument
based
on
the
history
of
the
statute
that
this
is
in
the
nature
of
the
condition
on
the
consent
of
the
suit
in
the
state
courts
would
apply
equally
to
the
tort
case
or
the
bulldozer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
arises
out
of
an
attempt
by
petitioner,
a
national
bank
in
nashville,
tennessee
to
foreclose
a
mortgage
on
property
owned
by
respondent.
respondent
contends
that
the
mortgage
is
not
in
default
and
therefore
brought
suit
in
a
tennessee
court
to
enjoin
the
foreclosure.
in
preliminary
proceedings,
the
trial
judge
concluded
that
there
was
a
bona
fide
dispute
over
the
default
issue
and
that
a
wrongful
foreclosure
would
cause
irreparable
harm
to
respondent.
he
concluded,
however,
that
a
federal
statute
enacted
in
1873
deprived
him
of
power
to
enter
an
injunction
against
the
national
bank
in
advance
of
final
judgment,
even
though
such
relief
would
have
been
appropriate
against
the
state
bank.
the
tennessee
supreme
court
reversed.
it
held
that
the
federal
statute
was
intended
to
protect
the
bank
and
its
creditors
from
the
issuance
of
certain
prejudgment
writs
but
it
did
not
apply
to
a
bank's
attempt
to
acquire
property
from
one
of
its
debtors
by
foreclosing
a
mortgage.
we
granted
certiorari.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
review
the
early
history
of
this
statute,
the
three
cases
in
which
this
court
has
previously
construed
it
and
conclude
that
the
judgment
of
the
tennessee
supreme
court
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
white
have
joined.
