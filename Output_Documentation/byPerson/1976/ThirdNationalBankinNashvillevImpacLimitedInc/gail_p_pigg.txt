ms.
gail
p.
pigg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
appease
the
court.
petitioner
propounds
the
theory
that
courts
of
our
land
cannot
interfere
by
injunctive
relief
to
protect
the
citizens
of
our
land
from
wrongful
foreclosure
of
their
property
by
a
national
bank
until
a
final
hearing
at
which
time
i
submit
the
damage
is
done.
ms.
gail
p.
pigg
you
honor
i
think
that
the
statute
clearly
on
its
face,
means
that
its
purpose
is
to
protect
creditors
from
ratable
distribution,
protect
the
assets
of
the
bank
from
ratable
distribution
among
its
creditors.
the
statute
defines;
it
is
self
defining
in
that
the
heading
of
it
regulates
transfers
by
banks
and
other
acts
in
contemplation
of
insolvency.
it
goes
further
after
that
heading
and
it
prohibits
transfers,
assignments,
payments
of
money
of
committed
act
or
an
act
of
insolvency
or
in
contemplation
there
off
with
a
view
to
prevent
the
application
of
the
banks’
assets
in
a
court
with
the
national
banking
act
and
with
a
view
to
prefer
one
creditor
over
another,
then
your
honor,
it
has
a
semicolon
and
it
says
and
no
attachment
or
no
injunction
attachment
or
garnishment
will
issue
against
any
bank,
against
any,
in
their
case
it
says
state
bank,
pending
a
final
hearing.
it
says
also
against
the
bank
or
its
assets
and
i
submit
there
is
an
important
clause,
but
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
i
submit
that
it
is
free
and
clear
of
ambiguity,
that
you
cannot
pull
the
last
clause
of
that,
that
entire
statute
it
is
one
sentence.
i
submit
that
you
cannot
pull
the
last
clause
and
apply
to
wherever
it
is
that
you
want
to
apply.
i
submit
that
this
is
good
law
and
i
would
like
to
say
initially
that
i
do
not
argue
or
that
responded
does
not
argue
with
that
law,
but
the
petitioner
goes
further
and
says
that
this
court
has
ruled
three
times,
that
the
courts
cannot
interfere
with
national
banks
to
protect
the
assets
of
its
debtors
pending
a
final
hearing,
always
pending
a
final
hearing.
now,
i
submit
that
these
cases
did
not
hold
that.
i
would
like
to
take
a
very
quick
look
at
mixter.
mixter
was
decided
by
chief
justice
white
or
mixter
was
an
opinion
written
by
chief
justice
white
in
1888.
in
that
particular
case,
the
bank
owed
mixter
$15,000.
mixter
began
a
suit
by
attachment.
now,
the
bank
was
not
insolvent
on
the
date
apparently
that
that
attachment
issued,
but
just
prior
day
too,
it
closed
its
doors.
then
it
resumed
business.
during
the
resumption
of
business,
the
attachment
issued.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
to
the
court
that
in
the
mixter
case,
i
have
felt
that
it
must
be
a
typographical
error
because
the
year
was
one
year
preceding
the
period
of
time
that
is
involved
and
i
think
when
the
court
reads
that
case,
it
will
see
what
i
mean.
nevertheless,
the
bank
was
in
severe
financial
difficulty
at
that
period
of
time.
this
would
be
i
think
the
obvious
reason
why
the
court
extended
or
appear
to
extend
the
statute
to
mean
that
the
banks
did
not
have
to
be
insolvent.
the
earle
case
decided
by
the
court
in
written
and
the
opinion
written
by
justice
harlan
in
1900
did
not
go
that
far.
this
was
a
case
in
which
one
mr.
long
as
i
recall
had
a
judgment
for
some
$31,000.
an
attachment
issued
by
garnishment
and
the
court
in
that
instance
hailed
that
this
last
clause
related
back
to
the
rest
of
the
section.
now,
it
also
in
that
instance
went
on
to
say
that
this
was
not
an
asset
of
the
bank,
but
nevertheless
it
clearly
allowed
the
attachment
by
garnishment
to
stand.
there
is
then
another
case,
this
is
van
reed
decision
written
by
mr.
justice
dave
(ph)
in
1905
and
this
case
was
another
simple
attachment
by
a
creditor,
in
which
event
the
court
related
back
to
the
mixter
case
and
extended
the
statute
to
apply
beyond
insolvency,
but
i
submit
to
the
court
that
these
banks
clearly
protect
or
these
cases
clearly
protect
the
bank
against
interferences
of
its
asserts
by
the
creditors.
ms.
gail
p.
pigg
yes
sir,
they
were
creditors
of
the
bank,
mt.
justice
stewart.
ms.
gail
p.
pigg
and
none
of
these
cases
and
it’s
almost
frightening
to
me
that
the
extension
that
they
have
extended
this
far.
none
of
these
cases
stands
for
the
proposition.
none
of
theses
cases
had
before
it
the
question
as
to
whether
the
bank
can
wrongfully
take
away
the
assets
of
the
debtor’s
property
or
the
assets
of
one
of
its
debtors.
not
a
single
one
and
i
submit
that
neither
of
these
cases
stands
for
that
proposition.
i
have
alluded,
i
think
to
the
fact
that
property
held
as
security
under
deem
of
trust
in
tennessee
is
not
owned
by
bank
and
i
would
like
to
look
to
tennessee
law
on
that
point
for
a
moment,
and
this
is
our
supported
course
in
my
brief,
but
the
mortgagee
is
clearly
a
creditor.
his
only
interest
in
the
property
is
as
security.
he
is
not
deemed
to
be
a
property
owner.
the
court
has
clearly
held
and
this
was
i
think
in
1955
supreme
court
case
that
legal
title
vests
in
the
trustee,
and
this
has
been
holding
in
that
state
for
the
last
many,
many
years,
certainly
since
the
turn
of
the
century.
ms.
gail
p.
pigg
the
trustee
in
this
case,
i
believe
now
is
mr.
kanaday,
but
the
trustee
your
honor
in
a
situation
like
this
is
always
selected
by
the
mortgagee
always.
i
know
of
no
exception
to
that
rule.
the
trustee
is
simply
selected
by
the
lender.
ms.
gail
p.
pigg
your
honor
certainly
the
mortgagee
has
an
interest
from
the
standpoint
of
his
security
interest.
he
has
and
we
get
into
a
situation
here
where
it
becomes
shaded.
once
the
property
is
sold
to
a
bona
fide
purchaser,
now
i
will
get
back
to
answer
to
your
question
in
just
a
moment,
but
once
the
property
is
sold
to
a
bona
fide
purchaser,
contrary
to
what
petitioner
say
is
that
that
property
under
the
tennessee
law
is
gone.
it
is
beyond
the
reach
of
that
mortgagor.
now,
that
is
assuming
that
he
is
a
bona
fide
purchaser
of
course,
but
the
trustee
has
only
such
power
as
he
is
granted
in
that
day
to
trust.
now,
the
serious
question
becomes
the
serious
question
throughout
this
entire
matter
becomes
who
determines
default.
in
the
event
there
is
no
default
the
trustee
has
no
power
and
it
is
a
dry
trust.
there
are
cases
again
throughout
state
that
state
just
exactly
that
and
i
would
like
to
point
that
the
jones
kennedy
said,
it
is
cited
in
my
brief
on
page
14,
states
that
the
property
cannot
be
recovered,
in
that
instance
there
was
a
fraudulent
sale,
an
actual
sale
whereby
the
mortgagee
fraudulently
took
the
property
of
back
and
then
sold
to
a
bona
fide
purchaser,
and
then
the
court
held
that
the
petitioner
could
only
recover
or
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
could
recover
the
damages.
ms.
gail
p.
pigg
your
honor
the
deed
of
trust
in
this
instance
was
used
was
a
very
standard
form
of
deed
trust.
ms.
gail
p.
pigg
in
the
event
of
default
he
can
advertise
for
twenty
or
twenty
one
consecutive
days
or
three
consecutive
weeks
and
this
is
stated,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
deed
of
trust
that
tells
how
one
determines
default.
there
is
no
labor
in
the
deed
of
trust
back
that
mortgagor.
ms.
gail
p.
pigg
your
honor
he
does
so
at
his
own
peril,
and
forgive
me
mr.
chief
justice…
ms.
gail
p.
pigg
that
is
not
the
question
before
this
court.
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
the
question
is…
ms.
gail
p.
pigg
yes,
i
would
have
to
agree
that
he
does
so
at
his
peril,
but
then
i
would
have
to
parry
with
the
question
what
is
his
peril?
what
is
the
remedy
of
the
property
owner?
the
remedy
of
the
property
owner;
first
of
all
tennessee
does
have
the
right
of
equity
or
redemption,
but
it
is
waived
in
this
deed
of
trust
as
it
is
waived
and
virtually
all
deeds
of
trust
in
state
of
tennessee,
i
know
of
none
that
would
be
different.
so
what
is
his
remedy?
he
has
waived
it
in
the
papers
and
the
terms
that
are
decided
or
controlled
by
the
lender.
he
has
waived
demand
notice
and
protest.
he
has
waived
the
equity
or
redemption.
what
can
he
do?
there
is
only
one
thing
that
he
could
do
if
the
theory
of
petitioner
were
accepted.
he
could,
petitioner
says
that
he
can
recover
the
property,
this
is
error.
he
can
recover
the
property
if
the
mortgagee
is
the
successful
bidder
and
retains
the
property
then
he
could,
i
am
confident
recover
the
property
under
tennessee
law.
but,
if
the
mortgagee
is
not
the
successful
bidder
he
cannot
recover
the
property
as
previously
stated.
his
next
remedy
then
and
petitioner
would
delegate
him
to
the
second
best
remedy.
he
has
only
one
other
and
that
is
to
recover
damages.
i
submit
to
the
court,
that
to
recover
damages
in
this
instance
is
not
sufficient.
damages
are
simply
inadequate
and
i
would
turn
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
fact
that
the
chancellor
in
the
first
hearing
of
the
matter
before
this
question
arose,
before
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
did
find
that
irreparable
damages
would
occur,
if
foreclosure
were
permitted
to
be
held
prior
to
a
final
hearing.
then
of
course
when
this
question
arose,
he
dissolved
the
injunction
only
to
be
reinstated
by
the
tennessee
supreme
court.
i
submit,
to
the
court
that
beyond
the
inadequacy
of
the
damages
that
the
legal
fees
that
would
be
involved
in
seeking
that
final
redress
would
be
impossible,
absolutely
impossible
for
most
people.
we
are
not
dealing
here
only
with
business
hardcore
commercially
oriented
people.
we
are
dealing
here
with
literally
hundreds
of
thousands
of
home
loans,
home
improvement
loans,
automobile
loans,
office
loans,
every
kind
of
loan
and
in
each
one
of
those
instances,
petitioner
stands
before
the
court
and
say
that
you
cannot
interfere
if
they
wrongfully
foreclose.
ms.
gail
p.
pigg
this
is
true
your
honor
and
i
am
referring
always
throughout
my
argument
only
to
national
banks.
when
i
state
that
we
are
concerned,
they
have
mortgage
loans
and
we
are
concerned
with
these
types
of
loans.
ms.
gail
p.
pigg
no,
sir
this
was
not
so.
i
am
sorry
your
honor,
if
i
mislead.
there
are
certain
things
that
are
obliviously
constitute
default.
ms.
gail
p.
pigg
yes
sir,
one
of
being
nonpayment,
one
on
them
being
a
question
of
whether
the
property
is
being
damaged
or
taxes
have
been
paid
or
insurance
has
been
kept
in
enforcement
there,
those
are
just
some
of
those,
but
i
am
talking
about
when
i
responded
to
the
question
earlier,
i
am
talking
about
who
will
make
that
determination?
let
me,
take
the
example
of
a
case
that
i
have
simply
followed
throughout
my
briefing,
and
would
prefer
to
name.
take
the
situation
of
a
man
who
pays
the
account
and
it
gets
wrongfully
credited
to
someone
else’s
account.
no
demand,
no
notice,
no
protest,
he
does
not
have
to
be
given
these.
advertisement
is
held
for
three
consecutive
weeks,
and
if
he
is
fortunate
enough
he
finds
that
in
the
newspaper
which
is
a
legal
publication.
from
that
point
he
immediately
tries
to
stop
that
sale.
tennessee
law
as
mr.
kanaday
stated
to
the
court
earlier,
has
a
five-day
notice
requirement.
you
must
give
the
mortgagee
five-days
notice
before
an
injunction
can
be
held
or
a
hearing
can
be
held
actually.
so
the
oppressed
party
and
i
will
call
him
the
oppressed
party
at
this
point
because
i
feel
that
he
is,
he
attempts
to
stop
the
sale
and
applies
to
the
court
for
injunctive
relief
and
the
court
says
to
that
citizen,
we
cannot
help
you.
the
courts
do
not
have
power
over
the
banks
to
stop
your
property
from
being
sold.
we
can
help
you
only,
after
the
act
is
done
and
we
will
try
to
help
you
recover
damages.
i
summit
to
the
court
that
this
is
at
the
point
of
taking.
it
becomes
questionable
is
to
whether
there
is
a
violation
of
due
process
of
the
fifth
amendment
of
that
individual.
now,
i
want
to
quickly
respond
to
a
question
that
was
asked
of
the
petitioner
earlier
and
that
is
that
i
do
not
attack
the
statute
as
unconstitutional
because
not
for
one
moment
do
i
concede
that
either
congress
or
this
honorable
court
ever
would
allow
any
bank,
anywhere
to
stand
in
the
shoes
of
the
court
and
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
a
man
is
in
fact
in
default
or
is
not.
so
i
certainly
do
not
attack
it
as
constitutional.
i
say
only
that
if
the
construction
were
accepted
which
petitioner
propounds
that
it
would
render
it
unconstitutional
and
that
is
the
only
way
that
i
enter
that
argument.
ms.
gail
p.
pigg
yeah,
there
was
a
--
i
would
have
to
say
to
the
court,
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
there
has
been
no
challenge
of
the
constitutionality
here
and
perhaps
i
misunderstood
what
you
were
saying.
ms.
gail
p.
pigg
yeah,
this
is
correct;
this
is
precisely
what
i
am
doing.
ms.
gail
p.
pigg
i
am
submitting
it
as
the
construction
as
a
part
of
determining
the
statute.
i
do
not
attack
the
statute
as
unconstitutional,
i
never
have.
ms.
gail
p.
pigg
well,
obviously
not.
this
is
an
argument
from
my
standpoint
and
i
will
proceed
from
that,
but
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
there
is
an
additional
situation
here.
whereas
the
man
who
has
the
example
that
i
proposed,
of
the
man
who
has
lost
his
house,
goes
back
into
the
sign
court
rounds
with
the
man
next
door
who
did
not
have
used
loan
with
a
national
bank
and
the
court
the
says
he
cannot
grant
an
injunction
in
so
far
as
a
savings
in
loan
or
an
insurance
company,
but
not
as
to
a
national
bank.
what
is
the
feeling
of
the
individual
at
that
point,
as
to
who
makes
the
determination
of
default?
what
is
his
39.23
to
due
process?
has
he
had
a
hearing?
i
submit
to
the
court
that
he
has
not
had
a
hearing.
he
has
simply
launched
the
property
prior
to
the
time
of
taking.
i
would
also
go
about
back
and
sight
mr.
justice
stewart
in
the
39.40
because
the
language
is
far
better
than
i
could
say
it.
in
that
if
the
right
to
notice
and
a
hearing
is
to
serve
its
full
purpose,
it
must
be
granted
at
the
time
when
the
deprivation
can
still
be
prevented,
that
this
court
does
not
embrace
the
proposition
if
the
wrong
can
be
done
if
it
cannot
be
undone.
i
submit
first
of
all
that
the
wrong
can
not
be
undone,
but
if
it
could,
that
that
does
not
relay
the
fact
that
the
oppressed
citizen
has
still
lost
his
property.
the
wrong
was
done
at
that
period
of
time.
there
are
three
major
points
that
i
state
here.
first
of
all,
that
the
statute
on
its
face
is
free
of
ambiguity.
second,
that
the
property
is
not
an
asset
of
the
bank.
it

third;
that
the
construction
they
seek
would
render
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
i
submit
to
the
court
somewhere
in
the
petitioner’s
brief,
i
have
stated
that
the
wheels
of
business
must
continue
to
run.
i
state
that
the
wheels
of
business
must
give
way
and
let
the
courts
determine
if
there
is
default.
first
of
all
now,
there
is
nothing
here
which
would
interfere
with
the
bank’s
rights,
ultimately.
if
there
is
a
hearing
under
the
foreclosure
injunction
statute
which
we
have,
if
there
is
a
hearing
then
it
will
be
determined
at
that
time
whether
there
is
possible
or
are
possibly
repairable
damages.
from
that
point,
there
will
be
a
hearing.
if
the
court
finds
at
that
time
that
there
are
no
irreparable
damages
in
the
picture
and
no
showing
of
irreparable
damages,
then
there
will
not
be
an
injunction
granted.
there
is
only
and
a
determination
to
be
made
as
to
whether
there
are
irreparable
damages
and
whether
the
bank
in
fact,
has
a
right
to
foreclose.

no
sir,
i
did
not.
i
would
state
to
the
court
that
i
do
follow
rule
40
of
the
supreme
court
rules
that
in
that
the
statement
of
a
question
presented
would
be
deemed
to
include
every
subsidiary
question
fairly
presented
there
in
it
and
i
do
feel
that
this
is
a
question
fairly
presented
under
the
issue.
to
please
the
court,
i
think
the
issue
is
obvious
and
i
think
that
it
really
is
a
quite
simple
issue.
the
tennessee
supreme
court
did
not
accept
petitioner’s
theory
that
the
tennessee
courts
could
not
protect
citizens’
properties
from
wrongful
foreclosure.
i
submit
that
that
court
gave
that
decision
contrary
to
petitioner’s
statement
in
his
brief,
very
thorough
examination
and
very
thorough
consideration
and
that
it
is
certainly
in
the
interest
of
public
policy
alone,
if
not
simply
to
misconstrue
a
statute,
that
the
state
of
tennessee,
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
be
upheld
in
its
decision.
thank
you
your
honors.
