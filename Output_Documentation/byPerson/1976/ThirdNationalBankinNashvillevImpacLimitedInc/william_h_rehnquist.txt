justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
that
sense
if
you
are
right
and
we
agree
with
petitioner
in
his
suggested
construction
of
statute,
we
affirm
that
we
have
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
because
they
were
wrong
on
the
statute
and
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
was
never
challenged.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
you
have
to
fish
or
cut
bait
on
thing.
either
you
do
assert
a
constitutional
challenge
and
then
you
have
to
demonstrate
that
you
have
a
right
to
do
so
on
this
state
of
the
record
or
you
say
as
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
are
simply
using
the
constitutional
argument
as
a
guidance
to
statutory
construction,
which
we
are
free
to
consider
along
with
all
the
other
statutory
guidelines.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
is
precisely
what
you
are
doing?
