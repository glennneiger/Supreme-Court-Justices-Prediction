unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
that
is
the
respondent
privileged
to
argue
that
this
statute
that
you
rely
on
is
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kanaday
if
the
mortgagor
wants
to
challenge
the
question
of
default,
are
they
really
in
default,
a)
how
is
it
normally
done,
if
there
is
a
state
bank
says
the
mortgagee
and
in
this
case
how
would
he
do
it,
once
a
federal
bank
under
your
view?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
normal
procedure
if
you
have
a
state
bank
as
the
mortgagee,
what
is
usually
done
in
this
a
kind
of
controversy?
is
it
the
pre-foreclosure
injunction
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
and
that
procedure
would
be
available
against
a
national
bank
here,
that
the
post-foreclosure
procedure
would
available?
unknown
speaker
doesn’t
a
mortgagee
have
inequitable
interest
in
the
property?
unknown
speaker
what
did
the
deed
of
trust
say
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
whatever
the
standard
it
was,
what
did
it
say
about
mortgagee,
privileges
--
and
to
decide
upon?
unknown
speaker
but
we
are
only
concerned
in
this
case
with
the
statute
involving
national
banks
as
i
understand
it?
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
made
a
statement
if
i
understood
you
correctly
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
deed
of
trust
that
indicated
what
constituted
on
the
event
default?
unknown
speaker
it
sets
forth
a
long
list
of
things
that
might
constitute
the
default.
unknown
speaker
so,
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
the
construction
of
the
statute,
you
do
not
expect
us
then
to
reach
any
constitutional
argument?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kanaday,
in
the
jurisdiction
where
i
practice
for
16
years,
the
statutes
provide
there
could
be
no
foreclosure
of
a
mortgage
without
judicial
action
and
in
a
judicial
action
such
as
was
provided
by
the
laws
of
arizona,
a
mortgagor
or
a
debtor
could
raise
any
of
the
issues
which
your
opponent
has
tried
to
raise
here
and
the
court
simply
would
not
grant
foreclosure
until
it
had
a
hearing
on
those
issues.
now,
i
take
if
there's
nothing
in
that
statutory
procedure
that
would
violate
what
you
refer
to
as
the
anti-injunction
provisions.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
would
it
not
make
some
sense
to
construe
the
injunction
language
as
i
suggested
earlier
as
being
the
same
sort
of
injunction
or
the
kind
of
injunction
that
you
would
think
of
in
connection
with
attachments
and
executions,
that
is
what
a
plaintiff
creditor
could
get
against
a
bank?
unknown
speaker
you
agreed
with
mr.
justice
stevens
that
the
statute
couldn’t
be
read
literally
out
to
the
very
length
and
breadth
of
it's
literal
language,
that
no
repeat,
no
injunction
shall
ever
be
issued
by
a
state
court
against
a
national
banking
association,
did
you
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
what
is
your
position?
your
answer
to
my
bulldozer
example
was
that
you
really
did
not
have
to
express
an
opinion
on
it,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
what
distinction
would
you
draw
in
order
that
my
bulldozer
example
could
be
governed
by
and
you
could
get
an
injunction
in
that
case
and
you
cannot
get
one
in
this?
unknown
speaker
now,
suppose
you
would
to
say
an
injunction
was
barred
if
the
bank
was
engaged
in
some
activities
not
related
to
its
banking
business?
unknown
speaker
for
example,
if
it
started
to
drill
for
oil
on
the
land,
technically,
you
think
a
court
of
equity
may
allow
on
an
injunction
then
if
you
could
show
all
the
usual
requirements.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kanaday,
what
happens
if
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
bank
violated
the
contract
and
the
mortgagor
did
not?
what
remedy
would
the
mortgagor
have
under
the
laws
of
tennessee?
unknown
speaker
as
you
change
a
law,
i
always
thought
that
property
could
not
be
compensated
adequately
for
damages.
well
with
that
aside,
assuming
that
the
computer
made
a
mistake
and
the
payment
had
been
made
twice
what
it
should
have
been
made
and
it
came
out
that
it
had
been
made
and
the
property
is
sold
to
bona
fide
purchaser,
what
remedy
does
the
mortgagor
have?
unknown
speaker
is
that
by
a
statutory
law?
unknown
speaker
is
it
by
case
law
and
if
so
what
is
the
case?
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
the
trust
agreement
waived
their
right
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
saying
that
a
part
of
equity
could
order
a
recession
to
that
sale
on
the
showing
that
is
postulated
by
justice
marshall.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kanaday,
i
want
to
be
sure
of
one
thing.
i
take
it
your
posture
here
is
that
you
are
relying
on
the
strict
language
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
and
i
also
take
it
that
in
effect
you
have
conceded
that
there
might
well
be
a
legislative
policy
that
would
apply
where
if
the
bank
is
the
debtor
on
the
one
hand
and
in
a
situation
of
this
kind
it
might
be
a
very
different
legislative
policy.
unknown
speaker
then
i
run
right
smack
into
justice
rehnquist’s
enquiry
about
his
bulldozer
case.
you
can
say
the
same
thing
about
that.
unknown
speaker
which
i
take
it
is
worth
more
than
that.
unknown
speaker
banks
hope
that
it
is
worth
more
than
that,
don’t
they,
to
get
their
money
back.
