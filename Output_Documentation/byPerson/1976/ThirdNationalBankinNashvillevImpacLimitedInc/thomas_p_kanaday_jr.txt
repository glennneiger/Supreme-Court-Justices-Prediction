mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
out
of
$700,000
loan
that
was
made
by
third
national
bank
to
certain
borrowers
to
finance
the
construction
of
a
commercial
office
building.
the
payment
of
the
loan
was
secured
by
deed
of
trust
under
the
terms
of
which
certain
real
property
was
conveyed
to
a
trustee,
who
was
granted
the
power
to
sell
the
property,
in
the
event
of
default.
the
loan
was
originally
made
in
may
of
1973
and
originally
matured
in
may
of
74.
however,
at
the
borrowers’
request
three
different
extensions
of
the
maturity
date
were
granted,
the
last
of
which
expired
in
july
1975.
in
august
of
1975,
the
bank
determined
that
the
loan
was
in
default
and
in
september
1975,
the
bank
gave
the
requisite
notice
of
foreclosure.
the
process
of
foreclosure
in
tennessee
is
an
exercise
of
private
contractual
right
and
is
not
accomplished
through
judicial
means.
after
the
notice
of
foreclosure
was
given,
the
respondents
filed
this
action
in
the
tennessee
chancery
court
seeking
to
enjoin
the
foreclosure.
the
chancellor
granted
a
temporary
injunction
restraining
the
bank
from
foreclosing.
the
bank
then
moved
to
dissolve
the
temporary
injunction
relying
on
the
provisions
of
12
united
states
code
section
91.
the
chancellor
granted
that
motion
holding
that
section
91
of
the
banking
act,
forbid
a
tennessee
court
from
enjoining
the
national
bank
prior
to
foreclosure.
respondents
filed
an
interlocutory
appeal
to
the
tennessee
supreme
court,
which
in
its
decision,
judicially
created
an
exception
to
the
anti-injunction
proviso
of
section
91.
the
tennessee
supreme
court
held
that
the
anti-injunction
proviso
does
not
apply
for
a
bank’s
debtors
seeking
to
restrain
the
foreclosure.
the
structure
of
my
argument
will
be
first
to
examine
the
grammatical
and
historical
meeting
of
the
anti-injunction
proviso
in
section
91,
then
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
state
court’s
decisions
and
having
done
that
to
explore,
whether
under
the
circumstances
present
in
this
case,
there
is
any
constitutional
impediment
to
its
historic
and
natural
construction.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
well,
clearly
under
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
in
this
case,
they
would
not
be
disabled
if…
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
under
our
theory,
i
do
not
know
because
in
the
instance
that
you
pass
it
to
me,
the
bank
is
acting
on
its
own
initiative
without
reliance
on
any
contractual
rights.
in
this
instance,
we
are
relying
on
our
rights
in
the
contract,
in
the
deed
of
trust.
so
i
do
not
know.
it
might
be
stretched
that
far.
there
is
a…
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
yes
sir,
this
court
in
1888,
when
it
decided
the
case
of
pacific
national
bank
versus
mixter
said
that
it
was
an
absolute
prohibition
and
that
the
remedy
and
that
was
an
attachment
case
and
not
an
injunction
case,
i
do
not
think
that
is
important.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
i
do
not
understand
that
the
limitation
that
is
implied
by
a
reference
to
the
attachment.
the
bank
is
relying
on
the
latter
part
of
section
91
which
provides
“no
attachment,
injunction
or
execution
shall
be
issued
against
such
association
or
its
property
before
final
judgment
in
any
suit,
action
or
proceeding
in
any
state,
county
or
municipal
court.”
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
no,
sir,
you
do
not.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
precisely,
that
is
what
i
have
tried
to
respond
that
we
are
relying
on
private
contractual
right
between
the
lender
and
the
borrower
that
were
defying
the
nature
of
the
relationship
and
the
rights
on
the
happening
of
certain
events,
rather
than
a
unilateral
action
on
the
part
of
the
bank.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
there
is
nothing
in
the
plain
reading
of
the
statute
that
draws
such
a
distinction,
but
i
do
not
think
that
we
have
to
embrace
such
an
egregious.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
justice
stevens,
i
am
not
saying
that
i
concede
how
the
statute
would
be
read
under
those
extreme
cases.
i
am
saying
that
important
distinctions
can
be
made.
i
do
not
know
how
to…
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
yes,
but
i
am
not
saying
that
the
statute
affords
us
the
liberty
to
make
those
distinctions
either
between
tort,
contract,
debtor,
creditor.
i
am
relying
on
to
the
facts
of
this
case
where
there
is
a
private
contractual
right
that
there
is
an
absolute
prohibition
on
the
statute
from
the
interference
prior
to
final
judgment.
if
there
is
any
confusion
about
the
proper
construction
of
anti-injunction
proviso,
it
arises
that
because
in
its
present
form,
section
91
as
an
amalgam
of
two
unrelated
statute.
the
first
portion
of
the
statute,
voids
preferential
transfers
of
property
by
insolvent
national
banks,
the
second
portion
of
section
91
prohibits
a
state
court
from
issuing
attachments,
injunctions
and
executions
against
a
national
bank
prior
to
final
judgment.
the
issue
in
this
case
of
course,
is
rather
a
state
court
can
issue
an
injunction
against
a
national
bank
before
closing
on
collateral,
prior
to
final
judgment.
now,
because
of
the
holding
of
the
tennessee
supreme
court,
i
think
another
way
of
stating
the
issue
is
whether
the
preceding
language
relating
to
preferential
transfers
in
some
manner
does
restrict
the
otherwise,
unqualified
meaning
and
unqualified
language
of
the
anti-injunction
proviso.
until,
1864,
a
national
bank
could
not
even
be
sued
in
the
state
court.
in
that
year,
a
statute
was
adopted
affording
jurisdiction
and
actions
against
national
banks
in
the
state
court.
in
1873,
the
congress
adopted
the
anti-injunction
proviso
as
a
limitation
upon
the
jurisdiction
of
state
courts
to
grant
certain
types
of
remedy
at
certain
stages
of
the
litigation
in
the
state
court
proceeding.
in
1873,
there
was
a
revision
of
the
banking
and
the
judiciary
code
and
as
a
result
of
this
revision,
there
was
an
inadvertent
deletion
of
the
anti-injunction
proviso
and
it
was
left
out
of
the
code
for
some
two
years
by
mere
inadvertence.
then,
in
1875,
there
was
another
revision
of
the
code
and
the
anti-injunction
proviso
reappeared
without
explanation
at
the
end
of
the
section
which
rewarded
preference
of
transfers
by
insolvent
national
banks
and
it
has
remained
in
that
position
through
the
present
day.
it
was
in
that
position
when
this
court
issued
its
decisions
in
mixter,
van
red
and
earle.
the
tennessee
supreme
court
reached
the
result
that
it
did
by
taking
the
erroneous
view
that
“we
look
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute
which
was
to
secure
the
assets
of
a
bank
whether
solvent
or
insolvent
for
ratable
distributions
among
its
general
creditors.”
we
say
that
was
not
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
the
clear
purpose
was
to
limit
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
to
grant
extraordinary
remedies
at
a
certain
stage
in
the
proceeding.
there
was
a
limitation
on
the
jurisdictional
grant
of
the
1864
statute.
the
first
case
that
this
court
has
decided
on
it
was
mixter,
pacific
national
bank
of
boston
versus
mixter
which
in
1888
held
that
the
anti-injunction
proviso
nullified
an
attachment
which
had
been
obtained
by
a
creditor
of
a
national
bank
against
funds
of
that
bank
on
deposit
in
another
bank.
the
court
clearly
rejected
the
argument
that
the
anti-injunction
proviso
of
section
91
is
somehow
limited
by
its
preceding
provisions
awarding
preferential
transfer.
the
court
said,
“as
it
stood
originally,
as
part
of
section
57,
after
1873
and
as
stands
now
in
the
revised
statute,
it
operates
as
a
prohibition
upon
all
attachments
against
national
banks,
under
the
authority
of
state
court.
the
form
of
its
reenactment
in
the
revised
statute
does
not
change
its
meaning
in
this
particular.
all
attachment
laws
of
this
state
must
be
read
as
if
they
contained
in
expressed
terms
that
they
were
not
able
to
apply
to
suit
against
a
national
bank,
the
remedy
is
taken
away
all
together
and
cannot
be
used
under
any
circumstances”
and
it
was
further
said,
that
“if
the
power
of
issuing
attachments
has
been
taken
away
from
the
state
court,
so
also
is
the
power
of
issuing
injunctions
that
is
true.”
and
that
was,
this
court’s
unanimous
construction
of
the
statute
in
1888.
the
mixter
case
then
was
followed
by
the
case
of
earle
versus
state
of
pennsylvania.
in
that
case,
a
creditor
of
a
bank
customer
sought
to
reach
funds
on
deposit
in
the
bank.
the
bank
claimed
no
interest
in
the
funds
and
was
a
mere
stakeholder.
this
court
concluded
that
this
was
not
an
action
against
a
bank
or
its
property
rights.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
supreme
court
in
the
earle
decision
dissolved
the
attachment
against
stock
which
the
bank
held
is
collateral
for
a
loan
of
that
customer.
but
unhappily,
we
do
not
have
a
statement
of
the
reasoning
of
the
court
and
doing
this,
presumably
because
of
the
applicability
of
the
anti-injunction
proviso.
the
present
case
is
clearly
not
within
the
ambit
of
the
exception
in
the
earle
case.
for
in
the
present
case,
the
proceeding
is
brought
by
the
respondents
against
a
national
bank
as
named
party
defendant
and
obviously
the
injunction
which
they
seek
would
materially
affect
the
bank
property
rights
and
its
collateral.
the
final
decision
was
in
1905
in
van
reed
versus
people's
national
bank,
which
reaffirmed
the
holding
of
mixter
again
in
an
attachment
case.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
under
the
terms
of
the
deed
of
trust,
the
trustee
who
is
appointed
in
the
instrument,
in
this
case
there
was
a
substitute
trustee
appointed,
the
bank
gave
notice
to
the
customer
of
the
default,
called
the
loan,
then
published
in
a
newspaper
in
davidson
county,
tennessee,
in
nashville,
once
each
week...
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
no
sir,
the
courts
are
not
used
at
all.
the
trustee
appointed
in
the
instrument
does
act
to
enforce
the
bank’s
right
under
the
power
of
settle
grant
(voice
overlap).
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
no
sir,
i
am
the
trustee
in
this
sale
was
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
the
other
trustee
then
reads
the
notice
of
foreclosure
whereas
there
has
been
a
default
called
the
note
due
and
it
has
been
advertised
in…
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
any
public
official,
no
sir,
there
is
not,
not
at
all.
we
did
not
get
any…
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
the
sale
after
it
is
held
by
the
trustee
is
not
reviewed
by
a
court;
as
i
understand
some
states
have
a
conformation
process
or
something
like
that.
we
do
not
have
that
actually;
it
is
entirely
a
private
act.
there
is
a
fiduciary
obligation
of
course
that
the
trustee
has,
but
there
is
no
public
review,
there
is
no
public
empowerment…
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
there
was
no
constitutional
issue
presented
in
this
case
at
all,
until
after
i
filed
my
brief
after
this
court
had
granted
certiorari
and
it
was
raised
in
the
respondents
reply.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
i
think
that
you
are
addressing
this
to
the
timeliness
issue
of…
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
no,
sir
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
even
appropriate
that
you
face
this.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
because
in
the
case
of
cardinal
versus
louisiana,
an
unanimous
decision
which
you
wrote,
you
wrote
this
way
“the
court
has
consistently
refused
to
decide
federal
constitutional
issues
raised
here
for
the
first
time
on
review
of
a
state
court
decision.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
and
your
question
is
what?
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
no,
sir
i
do
not
think
so.
one
for
the
reason
that
you
stated
in
the
cardinal
decision,
you
noted
not
only
the
jurisdictional
considerations
incident
to
that
rule,
but
you
also
noted
the
policy
reasons
incident
to
judicial
administration.
you
said
questions
not
raised
below
are
those
on
which
the
record
is
very
likely
to
be
inadequate,
since
it
certainly
was
not
complied
with
those
questions
in
mind.
now,
apart
from
this
court
role
in
the
appropriate
review
of
this
case,
i
think
there
is
another
result
of
the
failure
to
raise
the
question
in
timely
fashion
and
that
is
a
plain
waiver
of
a
constitutional
right
which
any
party
can
do
in
either
civil
or
criminal
litigations,
by
not
having
raised
it
in
the
trial
court,
not
having
raised
it
in
the
state
supreme
court
and
it
is
obvious
that
it
was
not
raised
in
those
proceedings,
because
the
state
court’s
opinion
clearly
said
and
i
agreed
with
it
at
the
time
on
this
one
point
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
any
other
forum
and
they
devote
a
portion
of
the
decision
to
a
holding
that
the
case
could
not
be
brought
in
the
federal
district
court,
which
was
true
as
we
understood
the
case
at
that
time,
thinking
it
was
strictly
a
federal
statutory
construction
case.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
there
are
two
procedures
to
be
followed
as
i
am
familiar
with
the
law
as
it
is
practiced
in
tennessee.
one
would
be;
a
pre-foreclosure
proceeding
to
enjoin
the
sale
or
to
have
the
sale
held
but
then
subject
to
further
orders
of
the
court
pending
a
hearing.
another
approach
would
be
a
post-foreclosure
proceeding
to
nullify
the
sale
to
set
it
aside
or
lacking
that,
they
might
be
content
to
file
a
suit
for
monetary
damages.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
your
honor,
i
have
seen
both
types
of
actions
brought
during
the
real
estate
crunch
in
1974
and
1975.
there
were
plenty
of
both
types
of
actions
and
the
reason
that
so
many
of
the
actions
were
brought
after
foreclosures
that
tennessee
does
have
a
statute
barring
an
application
for
an
injunction
unless
it
is
filed
within
five
days
preceding
foreclosure
and
many
people
sort
of
trip
up
on
that
procedure
or
requirement
which
and
bring
the
post…
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
oh,
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
do.
if
as
the
tennessee
supreme
court
held
and
if
as
the
respondent
urges
on
this
court
the
prohibition
against
the
issuing
of
injunctions
is
somehow,
constricted
by
the
preceding
language
in
section
91
relating
to
preferential
transfers
to
condition
to
insolvent
banks
to
the
securing
of
a
bank’s
assets
for
ratable
distributions
among
its
creditors,
then,
this
court
find
it
necessary
to
ignore
the
statutory
context
in
which
the
anti-injunction
proviso
was
adopted
and
that
was
as
an
amendment
to
the
statute
conferring
jurisdiction
on
state
courts
to
hear
actions
against
national
banks.
it
will
not
only
be
necessary
to
ignore
the
context
of
its
enactment.
it
will
be
necessary
to
ignore
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
van
reed
case
while
in
the
mixter
case,
as
mrs.
pigg
stated,
there
was
no
insolvency
in
the
bank
at
the
time
that
the
attachment
arose.
it
did
become
an
insolvent,
but
the
van
reed
decision
dispelled
any
notion
that
the
application
of
anti-injunction
proviso
is
in
anyway
limited
by
the
state
of
dissolvency
of
the
bank
in
question
or
the
securing
of
assets
for
ratable
distribution
to
its
creditors
and
then
make
that
quite
explicit
in
the
van
reed
opinion,
there's
no
intimation
that
the
bank
and
van
reed
was
insolvent
or
was
having
financial
difficulties
or
had
committed
preferential.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
i
don’t
believe
so
your
honor,
although,
i
am
not
intimately
acquainted
with
that
process.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
no
sir,
i
don’t
think
so,
one;
because
it
is
an
absolute
unconditional,
unqualified
prohibition
in
its
expressed
terms.
the
type
of
foreclosure
that
tennessee
has
under
its
deeds
of
trust
is
the
type
that
it
had
since
1796
when
it
became
a
state.
this
was
known
to
the
congress.
i
think
that
what
you
are
suggesting
is
an
important
policy
consideration
where
we
determining
point
is
the
appropriate
legislative
policy,
but
i
don’t
think
it's
of
any
assistance
in
the
construction
of
the
statute
as
we
find
it
now.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
i
don’t
recall
unqualifiedly
going
along
with
that.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
that
is
correct.
we
can
always
conjure
up
a
parade
of
probables
that
it
carries
a
case
beyond…
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
the
distinction
that
i
would
draw
would
be
limited
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
am
not
prepared
to
tell
this
court
what
would
or
would
not
happen
in
the
bulldozer
case
because
we
do
not
have
the
bulldozer
case.
i
am
prepared
to
say
that
there
is
a
basis
for
a
logical
distinction
where
the
bank
is
acting
pursuant
to
a
private
contract
which
defines
events
of
default
and
consequences
of
those
events
of
defaults
as
opposed
to
when
the
bank
acts
unilaterally
on
its
own
notion.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
it
may
well
be
that
when
a
national
banking
association
is
acting
beyond
its
powers.
it
is
not
entitled
as
in
those
activities
to
the
protection
of
the
national
banking
act.
in
the
present
situation,
it
is
the
most
usual
type
of
national
banking
power
that
it
is
exercising
and
that
is
to
realize
upon
collateral.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
well,
mrs.
pigg
and
i
seem
to
have
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
whether
or
not
the
sale
could
be
nullified
and
set
aside.
she
said
that
under
tennessee
law,
this
could
not
happen
if
it
came
into
the
hands
of
a
bona
fide
purchaser.
as
i
understand
the
law
in
the
state
of
tennessee
that
no
notion
of
the
good
faith
purchase
of
a
value
in
real
property,
the
transfer
retakes
no
better
title
than
the
transferor
conveyed
and
so
i
think
that
it
could
be
set
aside
as
a
matter
of
conveyance
involved.
in
addition,
the
bank
acts
at
its
extreme
peril
because
there
could
be
a
remedy
of
damages,
which
all
be
it,
leaves
some
room
for
dissatisfaction
which
is
the
conventional
remedy
for
wrongful
taking.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
in
my
opinion,
they
have
the
remedy
to
set
the
sale
aside
and
should
that
not
be
granted…
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
no
sir
it
is
not.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
case
that
i
can
call
to
your
attention
today
on
that
point,
but
in
the
conveyancing
law
in
the
state
of
tennessee,
the
transferee
takes
no
better
title
to
the
transferor
and
it
is
actually
two
parts
to
it;
the
transferor
would
not
have
the
legal
power
to
conduct
the
sale.
it
would
be
an
absence
of
capacity
as
though
it
were
a
minor.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
it
waves
to
equity
of
redemption,
which
is
different
from
the
equitable
power
to
void
a
transaction
i
think.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
although
i
admit
the
mistake
and
i
differ
on
at
construction
of
tennessee
legal
principle.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
am.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
if
i
made
a
concession
that
there
is
a
different
legislative
policy
implemented
in
the
anti-injunction
proviso
depending
on
whether
the
bank
is
a
debtor
or
a
creditor
it
was
in
a
inadvertent
admission.
i
think
that
policy
that
is
expressed
in
this
act
is
a
concern
incident
to
the
federal
regulation
of
the
national
banks
for
the
liquidity
of
the
banks,
for
the
ability
to
immediately
realize
on
important
types
of
assets
that
are
within
the
bank’s
control.
that
asset
maybe
a
bank
account
as
it
was
in
mixter,
the
asset
maybe
or
the
property
right
which
is
important
to
the
solvency
and
the
continuing
management
of
the
bank,
maybe
it
is
collateral,
banking
up
a
loan.
i
think
it
is
the
same
policy
that
underlies
the
statute
further,
if
the
bank
is
debtor
or
creditor.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
i
do
not
know
whether
that
is
an
appropriate
exercise
of
the
banking
powers
to
do
that
type
of
an
act
and
i
admit
that
that
is
a
real
egregious,
horrible
that
has
been
applied.
we
can
be
equally
disheartened
about
the
widow,
whose
life
savings
is
in
the
her
home
and
she
only
owes
a
$1000
and
the
bank
wrongfully
forecloses,
we
can
postulate
like
horrible,
but
i
do
not
think
that
we
are
dealing
with
anything
here,
but
a
foreclosure
on
a
$700,000
commercial
office
building
and
i
think
that
we
make
a
mistake…
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
i
could
not
tell
you
whether
you
could
make
a
deal
on
the
building
or
not
your
honor,
the
bank
might
be
tempted.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
must
admit
that
because
i
view
the
entire
injunction
proviso
as
a
limitation
on
the
congressional
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
state
courts
that
you
got
me
into
that
corner
and
if
i
am
going
to
be
faithful
to
that
position,
i
suppose
view
it
as
a
jurisdictional
limitation
that
it
might
well
do
that.
yes
sir.
the
factors
that
we
have
heard
mentioned
today,
adequacy
of
other
remedies,
legal
fees,
fraction
on
home
loans,
the
possibility
of
error
in
bank
judgment,
these
are
all
important
considerations.
these
are
the
types
of
the
things
that
congress
in
its
wisdom
should
balance
in
its
mind
and
in
its
will
in
formulating
the
extent
to
which
it
would
consent
for
the
national
banks
to
be
sued
in
state
court
forum.
mr.
thomas
p.
kanaday,
jr.
yes
sir.
