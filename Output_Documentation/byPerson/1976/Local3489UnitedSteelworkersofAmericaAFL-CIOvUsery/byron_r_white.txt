justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
this
is
a
direct
enforcement
sort
of
statue
and
to
enforce
that
the
secretary
goes
to
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
an
administrative
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
it's
like
the
antitrust
laws,
the
proper
justice
just
files
a
law
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
and
so
the
secretary
in
this
case
like
the
attorney
general
is
asserting
some
construction
of
the
law
in
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
a
speech
of
the
assistant
attorney
general
in
charge
of
the
antitrust
division.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
the
individual
can
sue
himself?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
can't
and
the
secretary
is
required
to
investigate
and
make
a
decision
to
whether
to
sue
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
his
decision
not
to
sue
is
reviewable?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
has
a
difference
--
different,
different
antitrust
different
situation
where
the
anti-trust
--
there
may
be
complaints
filed
at
antitrust
division
but
nobody
is
about
to
review
the
assistant
attorney
general's
decision
not
to
file
the
case?
