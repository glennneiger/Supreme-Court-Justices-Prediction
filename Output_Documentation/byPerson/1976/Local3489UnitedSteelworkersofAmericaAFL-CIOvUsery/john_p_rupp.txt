mr.
john
p.
rupp
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitionerâ€™s
burden
has
been
to
convince
this
court
that
their
meeting
attendance
rule
is
reasonable,
under
section
401
(e)
of
the
labor-management
reporting
and
disclosure
act
despite
the
fact,
that
during
the
1970
election
it
disqualified,
96.5%
of
the
members
of
local
3489
for
standing
for
office
and
despite
the
fact,
that
it
requires
dissident
unit
members
to
plan
their
candidacies
as
early
as
18
months
prior
to
the
election.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
i
say
as
early
as
and
i'll
return
to
that
at
a
moment,
but
so
long
as
the
person
desiring
to
run
for
office
has
not
attended
a
significant
number
of
meetings
in
the
early
part
of
the
term,
the
burden
that
can
result
from
operation
of
the
rule
is
a
requirement
to
attend
all
18
meetings,
proceeding
the
election.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
we
don't
know
--
well,
we
do
have
some
indication
from
this
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
there
are
some
people
of
course
who
are
interested
in
attending
union
meetings
to
see
some
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
it
is.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
the
register
--
the
meeting
attendance
register
in
this
case
reflects
the
number
of
members
who
attended
each
and
every
meeting
during
the
three-year
period
preceding
the
1970
election.
what
the
teller
did
in
this
case
and
in
another
cases
involving
steelworker
locals,
is
to
compute
from
that
attendance
register,
the
number
of
people
who
were
qualified
to
stand
for
office
by
virtue
of
their
attendance;
actual
attendance
in
meetings.
in
this
case,
the
results
of
those
tabulations
where
the
22
members
of
this
local
were
eligible
to
stand
for
office
in
1970.
so
we
do
know,
that
the
top
here
so
far
as
meeting
attendance;
actual
meeting
attendance
is
concerned
was
22
members.
now
some
of
those
members
obviously
went
to
those
meetings,
not
having
any
present
or
developed
intention
of
running
for
office.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
we
know
that
three
members
went
to
more
than
15
meetings
but
fewer
of
them
18
minutes.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
the
record
doesn't
reflected.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
the
record
doesn't
reflect
it.
petitioners
rests
its
defense
on
rule
--
of
the
rule
on
three
related
objectives
which
in
their
view,
the
rule
is
designed
to
serve.
assurance
that
would
be
office
holders
have
an
interest
in
the
union
and
union
affairs,
assurance
of
capable
union
leadership
and
encouragement
of
attendance
in
meetings,
but
at
no
time
have
petitioners
attempted
to
demonstrate
that
these
objectives
can't
be
met
by
methods
or
requirements
that's
trench
less
severely
on
the
goals
of
the
labor-management
reporting
and
disclosure
act,
and
particularly
the
election
provisions
of
title
iv
than
does
the
rule
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
i
believe
that
the
secretary
did
have
the
burden
of
proof,
that
is
right.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that
is
correct.
now,
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
though
that
the
secretary's
determination
is
not
entitled
to
some
weight.
perhaps
it
is
entitled
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
no,
no,
we
are
not,
the
secretary
has
not
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that
is
a
point
that
i
want
to
make.
he
is
a
plaintiff
in
a
representational
sense.
the
secretary
is
not
entitled
to
a
presumption
in
his
favor.
he
is
not
entitled
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
i
think
that
he
has
entitled
to
somewhat
greater
weight.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
because
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
as
this
court
found
in
the
hotel
employees
case
and
again
glass
bottle
blowers
case,
the
decision
to
entrust
the
administration
of
this
statute
to
the
secretary
of
labor
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes
they
are,
but
not
in
quite
the
same
sense.
this
is
an
administrative
official.
in
this
case,
we
are
taking
a
very
largely
prosecutorial
functions.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well
that
is
correct,
and
i
don't
want
to
make
a
big
point
of
this.
we,
our
position,
our
basic
position
is
that
the
case
has
been
made
here
that
this
rule
is
unreasonable.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
and
i
do
concede
that
the
secretary
has
the
burden.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well
that
may
have
been
one
of
the
motives.
another
is
that
centralized
control
by
an
administrative
official
and
official
of
the
united
states
government
having
some
expertise
in
this
matter
was
taught
to
be
beneficent.
there
was
also
requirement
in
the
act
as
you
know,
for
the
exhaustion
of
internal
administrative
remedies
within
the
union.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
he
can't.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
i
believe
that
it
is.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that
is
correct,
it's
also
different
than
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
p.
rupp
an
individual
can
sue.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
yes.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
we
submit
--
our
basic
submission
here
is
that
the
secretary
has
shown
by
overwhelming
evidence,
the
unreasonableness
of
this
rule.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
let
me
say
that
the
secretary's
regulations,
which
where
promulgated
by
the
secretary
in
an
effort
to
provide
some
guidance
to
unions
affected
by
the
labor-management
reporting
and
disclosure
act,
list
a
number
of
factors
that
are
to
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
the
reasonableness
of
a
rule.
at
one
point,
the
secretary
indulged
in
a
presumption
that
a
meeting
attendance
rule
extending
over
two-year
period
of
time
and
requiring
no
more
than
50%
attendance
at
the
meetings
that
occur
during
that
period,
would
be
reasonable
absent
extraordinary
circumstances.
the
secretary's
experience
under
this
act
since
1959
has
led
him
to
conclude
that
in
a
flexible
approach
of
that
sort
is
now
warranted.
the
fact
there
is
that
the
secretary
presently
considers
are
the
relationship
of
the
qualifications
to
the
legitimate
needs
and
interest
of
the
union,
the
relationship
and
the
qualifications
of
the
man's
union
office,
the
impact
of
the
qualification
in
percentage
terms
and
the
burden
that
the
particular
qualification
entails
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that's
correct.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
what
he
is
attempting
to
do
is
provide
guidance
to
unions
that
are
reflected
by
the
statute?
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well
he
goes
through
it
in
the
first
instance
to
decide
whether
to
contact
the
international
union
or
the
local
involved
to
attempt
to
convince
them
and
change
the
rule,
there
is
that
kind
of
an
administrative
process
if
i
can
call
it
that,
that
precedes
the
filing
of
the
complaint
and
effort
is
made
in
every
case
to
try
to
resolve
differences
between
the
secretary
and
the
union
short
of
litigation.
only
if
those
efforts
have
failed
and
the
secretary
concludes
that
the
requirement
is
unreasonable,
does
the
secretary
goes
to
the
court
and
while
the
record
here
doesn't
show,
the
number
of
cases
in
which
an
amicable
or
somewhat
less
than
amicable
settlement
has
achieved,
but
it
is
achieved
in
a
number
of
cases.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that
is
one
of
the
purposes.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
it
was
not,
well
perhaps,
simply
stated
perhaps
that
is
the
purpose,
the
overriding
purpose,
but
congress
also
had
other
kinds
of
things
in
mind
that
are
related
to
avoiding
the
perpetuation
in
office
of
incumbent
leadership,
by
incumbent
leadership.
congress
had
in
mind
permitting
union
members
to
have
a
free
and
democratic
voice
in
union
affairs.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
that
is
the
overriding
purpose.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
it
is
the
secretary's
position
that
if
one
or
two
percent
of
the
membership
are
eligible
to
run
for
office
because
of
a
candidacy
restriction,
that
is
prime
facie
evidence
of
a
violation
of
the
act.
i
do
not
know
precisely
how
one
would
prove
that
there
has
been
a
kind
of
entrenchment.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
one
would
never
know
precisely
whether
those
people
were
maintained
in
office
because
they
happen
to
be
enlighten
leadership
and
they
were
able
to
carry
the.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
but
congress's
purpose
here
was
not
to
turned
out
union
office
for
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
if
the
record
show
that
they
had
not
been
turned
out?
mr.
john
p.
rupp
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
is
the
case.
we
may
well
have
a
situation
in
which
there
is
a
turnover
--
in
which
there
was
a
turnover
in
the
principle
union
offices
among
a
relatively
small
coterie
of
people.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
passing
the
office
back
and
forth,
we
have
seen
that.
that
is
not
what
congress
had
in
mind.
congress
had
in
mind
that
everyone,
every
union
member
in
good
standing
should
have
the
opportunity
to
run
for
office,
subject
to
reasonable
qualifications
uniformly
imposed.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
the
focus
of
the
secretary's
inquiry
is
on
whether
union
members
have
had
an
opportunity
for
free
and
democratic
election
which
is
perhaps
another
way
of
stating
your
point.
in
the
process
of
determining
whether
that
has
occurred
in
a
particular
case,
the
secretary
looks
in
a
variety
of
factors,
including
whether
there
has
been
a
continuation
in
office
of
the
same
people,
but
that
can
never
be
conclusive
because
those
people
may
have
been
continued
in
office
for
entirely
legitimate
regions.
but
when
the
secretary
also
sees,
in
addition
to
or
perhaps
even
when
the
entrenchment
is
not
clear,
that
only
a
very
small
number
of
people
are
eligible
to
run
for
office
in
any
given
election,
that
a
particular
candidacy
qualification
imposes
substantial
burdens
on
members
desiring
to
run
for
office
and
those
burdens
are
not
justified
in
the
secretary's
view
by
the
objectives
of
the
particular
qualification.
the
secretary
believes
he
has
the
duty
to
bring
a
law
suit
and
believes
that
the
particular
qualification
is
unreasonable.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
it
is
difficult.
i
would
concede
it
deals
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
no,
i
will
not.
no.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
no.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
if
sure
means
a
100
assurance,
i
suppose
that
is
impossible.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
we
have
to
recall.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
of
course
it
would
be
ideal
if
that
kind
of
predictability
were
possible
and
perhaps
in
some
unions
it
is.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
with
5,200
locals.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
no,
that
is
not
the
case.
if
you
look
at
the
cases
cited
in
the
government's
brief
on
page
25
i
believe,
the
data
is
cited
on
page
25
of
the
government's
brief,
you
will
find
that
the
situation
we
have
here
because
of
the
operation
of
this
three-year
50%
meeting
attendance
requirement,
has
been
about
the
same
in
all
other
locals
that
the
secretary
has
brought
suit
we
believe
in
most
other
locals.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
our
position
is
precisely
that.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
but
the
reason
is
not
only
because
it
happens
to
eliminate
to
disqualify
from
seeking
union
office.
in
most
cases,
in
which
it's
applied
90%,
95%,
98%
of
the
union
membership,
it
is
also
because
it
places
a
very
significant,
unjustified
burden
on
people
desiring
the
run
for
union
office.
the
steelworkers
have
a
relatively
easy
task,
we
believe
so
far
as
the
first
aspect
of
the
decision
that
they
have
to
make.
that
is
we
believe
that
a
three-year,
50%
meeting
attendance
requirement
is
unreasonable,
unreasonable
without
more.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
it
is
exceedingly
difficult
to
me
to
stand
here
and
say
that
the
secretary
is
going
to
say
that
a
two-year,
50%
rule
is
okay,
that
a
one-year,
50%
rule
is
okay,
we
do
not
have
that
experience
in
the
steelworkers
union.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
a
reasonable
rule.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
of
course.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
i
simply
cannot
give
you
a
precise
rule.
the
matter
is
more
complicated
than
that.
it
requires
more
knowledge
of
the
dynamics
than
i
have.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
the
steelworkers
will
then
look
at
the
situation
that
prevails
and
they
are
now
5,200
locals,
they
were
3700
locals
at
the
time
this
litigation
began.
we
will
attempt
to
structure
a
rule,
either
a
meeting
attendance
rule
or
some
other
rule
to
serve
the
objectives
that
they
believe
ought
to
be
served,
encouragement
of
attendance
at
meetings.
the
secretary
will
then
look
at
the
operation
of
that
rule
in
particular
locals,
in
as
many
locals
as
possible
and
try
to
reach
a
determination
concerning
its
reasonableness.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
it
certainly
is
not
a
fact
question
or
factual
disputes
involved
in
this
record,
i
think
they
are
minor.
it
is
very
largely
a
question
of
law.
again
part
of
it
difficult
to
hear
i
think
stems
from
the
fact,
that
what
congress
did
hear
was
to
say
that
any
meeting
at
any
qualification
for
candidacy
has
to
be
reasonable.
that
term
has
content,
but
it
has
content
--
it
develops
specific
content
in
the
process
of
administering
the
statute,
in
the
process
of
the
courts
looking
at
the
impact
of
particular
rules
in
the
context
of
particular
locals.
now,
it
seems
quite
unlikely
to
me
that
the
secretary
is
going
to
challenge
a
meeting
attendance
requirement
that
extends
for
a
year
and
requires
attendance
of
50
%
in
the
meetings.
we
know
that
a
number
of
international
unions
have
such
rules.
the
secretary
has
not
moved
against
such
rules.
there
are
some
additional,
a
few
additional
unions
that
have
two-year
rules
and
require
50
percent
attendance
at
those
meetings.
again,
the
secretary
has
not
thus
far
challenged
those
rules
because
at
this
point,
they
appear
to
be
operating
reasonably,
they
appear
to
be
administered
reasonably,
and
they
are
responsive
to
bona
fide
union
objectives.
if
the
steelworkers
are
concerned
about
being
caught
in
a
kind
of
whipsaw
of
the
term
reasonableness,
not
knowing
precisely
where
to
turn,
one
suggestion
that
they
might
pursue
is
to
look
at
what
is
occurring
among
unions
elsewhere.
this
rule
is
virtually
unique
in
trade
union
practice.
only
one
other
international
union
has
a
three-year,
50
%
meeting
attendance
requirement.
that
union
requires
attendance
at
two
meetings
during
the
first
year,
two
meetings
during
the
second
year,
and
three
meetings
during
the
third
year,
for
a
total
of
seven
meetings.
the
steelworkers
require
18.
we
know
of
no
other
case
involving
a
rule,
that
so
uniformly
and
consistently
disqualifies
90-95-98
%
of
the
membership
standing
for
office.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
yes,
we
do
know
what
happens
in
that
circumstance
because
it
occurred
here.
in
the
1970
election,
23
people
were
found
to
be
eligible
to
seek
office,
13
of
those
people
chose
to
run,
the
union
has
ten
offices.
because
of
the
concentration
of
people
for
couple
of
offices,
trusteeship
decisions
and
the
presidency,
one
office
was
left
without
a
nominee
who
was
eligible
to
run.
under
the
long
standing
practice
of
this
union,
if
no
one
is
eligible
to
seek
the
office,
the
union
permits
an
otherwise
ineligible
person
to
run
on
the
post.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
i
do
not
think
the
record
tells
us.
now
let
me
also
add
a
couple
of
figures
that
i
think
are
a
less
relevant,
go
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
point
about
entrenchment,
that
is
of
the
13
people
who
ran
in
this
local
in
1970,
six
were
incumbents,
most
of
those
ran
to
fill
offices
albeit
one
or
two,
ran
to
fill
offices
and
were
unopposed
in
the
election.
all
incumbents
prevailed
in
the
election
which
means
that
incumbents
retained
control
in
this
union
in
1970,
of
six
of
the
ten
offices.
the
only
offices
for
which
there
was
opposition
were
the
offices
of
president
and
trustee.
for
president,
there
were
three
candidates,
for
trusteeships
of
which
there
were
three,
there
were
four
candidates.
of
660
members,
22
were
found
to
be
eligible
by
virtue
of
having
attended,
by
virtue
of
their
having
attended
the
requisite
number
of
meetings.
an
additional
member
was
found
to
be
eligible
by
a
combination
of
meeting
attendance,
credits
and
meeting
attendance.
now,
the
steelworkers
dispute,
the
court
of
appeals
finding
that
there
were
only
23
eligible
members
here,
it
seems
to
us
that
that
challenge
come
much
too
late.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record,
there
is
testimony
in
the
record,
involving
labor
department's
investigator,
and
the
question
is
i
believe
this
has
been
asked,
it
came
at
the
end
of
the
government
counsel's
questions
of
the
labor
department's
investigators,
i
believe
this
question
has
been
asked,
however
to
be
sure,
based
on
your
investigation
of
the
attendance
register
and
the
work
credits
and
strengths
deal
the
employers,
whether
any
other
members
of
the
defending
local
other
than
mr.
loru
(ph)
eligible
by
virtue
of
a
combination
of
attendance
credits
and
work
credits?
the
answer
was
no.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
are
incumbents?
nine
or
ten,
so
half.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that
is
right.
now
that
means
that
of
the
non-incumbent
officers
of
this
union
in
1970,
less
than
2
%
of
the
membership
were
eligible
to
run
for
office.
now,
i
might
bring
to
the
court's
attention
a
case
that
was
decided
by
the
first
circuit
a
couple
of
days
ago,
a
panel
comprised
of
mr.
justice
clark
and
judges
mcentee
and
campbell
involving
a
rule
of
the
amalgamated
transit
union.
this
was
a
two-year
rule
and
the
required
attendance
at
six
meetings
for
each
of
those
years.
the
court
held
that
that
rule
was
unreasonable.
it's
reasoning
in
essence
was
that,
that
rule,
like
this
rule,
requires
people
desiring
to
run
for
office
to
plan
their
candidacies
as
early
as
18
months
prior
the
election.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
we
do
not
have
a
cite
yet,
but
i
have
given
copies
to
court
clerk.
the
name
of
the
case
is
usery
versus
local
division
1205.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
usery,
yes,
of
the
amalgamated
transit
union
and
as
i
say...
mr.
john
p.
rupp
i
have
provided
copies
to
the
clerk
and
then
he
will
circulate.
so
again
it
seems
to
me
that
the
principal
problems
with
this
rule
are
two.
first,
it
disqualifies
the
vast
majority
of
the
members
of
local
steelworkers
union
from
seeking,
standing
for
office.
secondly,
it
places
an
enormous
burden
on
people
desiring
to
run
for
office,
that
is
it
requires
them
to
plan
their
nominations
as
their
candidacies
as
early
as
18
months
prior
to
the
election.
the
justifications
that
have
been
advanced
by
the
steelworkers
for
the
rule
are
basically
three;
encouragement
of
attendance
of
meeting,
assurance
with
the
office
holders
having
interest
in
union
affairs,
and
assurance
of
capable
union
leadership.
while
the
secretary
does
not
believe
that
meeting
attendance
rules
are
not
responsive
to
any
bona
fide
union
objectives,
he
does
not
believe
that
this
meeting
attendance
rule
is
sufficiently
related
to
those
objectives
to
justify
the
burdens
and
the
effects
of
the
rule.
there
is
no
showing
here
for
example,
that
a
two-year,
50
%
meeting
attendance
rule
would
not
have
been
as
efficacious
in
serving
the
goals
that
the
steelworkers
say
they
are
attempting
to
serve
here
as
does
their
three-year
50
%
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
the
secretary's
position
is
that
the
rule
is
unreasonable
because
it
disqualifies
over
90
%
of
the
union
members
from
seeking
office
and
requires
them
to
plan
their
candidacies
18
months
in
advance
of
the
election.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
and
we
believe
we
have
proved
that.
we
believe
it
is
unreasonable
without
more.
at
a
minimum,
however,
we
believe
that
it
is
unreasonable
unless
there
are
overwhelming
justifications.
we
do
not
think
that
the
steelworkers
have
advanced
any
in
this
case.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
the
goal
is
free
and
democratic
elections.
it
seems
to
me
incredible
and
this
court
itself
has
analogized
section
401
(e)
to
political
elections
generally,
that
is
the
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
structured
democratic
elections
for
unions,
elections
for
the
populous
at
large,
it
seems
inconceivable
to
me
that
this
court
would
long
tolerate
a
qualification
on
candidacy
that
disqualified
96
to
98
%
of
the
eligible
american
voters
for
standing
for
public
office.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
this
union
has
what
is
an
essence
a
residency
requirement.
it
is
not
15
years
but
there
was
not
--
but
this
court
has
never
been
confronted
with
data
of
this
sort,
evidence
of
this
sort.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
i
do
not
believe
that
it
would
disqualify
96.5
%
or
98
%
of
those
people
who
do
not
presently
hold
office
from
seeking
office
in
florida.
it
is
inconceivable,
and
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
if
it
did,
it
would
be
held
to
be
constitutional.
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
qualification,
i
think
impossible
to
conceive
the
qualification
in
the
political
arena,
generally,
that
would
disqualify
that
kind
of
people
in
placing
an
18-month
burden
on
their
candidacies
and
that
this
court
would
still
find
that
it
was
constitutional.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
no,
there
is
no
constitutional
question.
the
question
is
one
of
statute.
