justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
doesn't
--
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
rule
as
i
remember
was
to
encourage
meeting
attendance,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
i
understand,
but
just
to
confining
it
to
encouraging
meeting
attendance,
it
really
has
not
succeeded
in
that
purpose
at
all,
has
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
mean
that
most
of
the
locals
has
less
10%
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
must
decide
under
the
rule
at
least
18
months
in
advance
of
the
election,
if
they
want
to
oppose
the
leadership,
must
they
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
18
months
in
advance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
just
that
18
months
time
period
is
kind
of
unreasonable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
he
would
have
to
make
it
too
late?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
just
the
only
thought
that
runs
through
my
mind
is
the
fact
that
you
can
hypothesize
a
whole
host
of
invalid
rules;
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
very
persuasive
as
to
whether
this
is
a
real
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
are
not
deciding
what
was
reason
or
unreasonable
about
the
secretary
has
done
in
another
situations.
the
question
is
whether
this
particular
rule
is
reasonable,
is
that
the
only
the
issue
we
have
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
put
it
this
way.
without
referring
to
the
secretary
at
all,
it
would
be
helpful
if
you
could
give
me
some
persuasive
reason
why
it's
reasonable
to
say
that
unless
a
man
makes
up
his
mind
18
months
in
advance
of
an
election,
that
he
wants
to
be
a
candidate
in
that
election,
he
may
not
become
a
candidate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
if
he
doesn't
know
until
within
the
18
month
the
period
that
he
disagrees
with
the
leadership.
i
mean,
persons
aren't
permanently
opponents
or
supporters,
they
always
change
their
minds.
you
have
to
become
and
opponent
more
than
18
months
in
advance
under
your
approach,
as
i
understand
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
unless
you
are
within
the
3%
or
so
that
attend
meetings
regularly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
his
administrative
burden
is
more
on
the
nature
of
advice
is
to
the
kind
of
cases
he
will
initiate
rather
than
that
improvement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
the
purpose
of
committing
the
oarsmen
function
to
the
secretary
and
denying
the
individual
member
to
right
to
sue,
wasn't
that
designed
to
screen
out
frivolous
claims
and
protect
the
unions
from
having
to
defend
too
many
claims
in
this
case,
but
perhaps
supposing
even
harder
and
more
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
rupp
does
the
record
tell
us
what
would
happen
in
this
case,
if
there
were
less
people
who
were
eligible
to
run
than
there
were
vacant
officers,
that
could
happen
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
that
is
a
purely
a
local
practice
or
whether
that
is
consistent
with
international
constitution?
