chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
75-657,
the
united
steelworkers
against
usery,
the
secretary
of
labor.
mr.
frankel
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
other
sanctions,
if
any,
are
there
for
non-attendance
of
meetings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
appoints
the
tellers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
a
regular
meeting?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
a
stated
meeting
in
which
the
purpose
of
the
meeting
is
announced
in
advance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
what
process
could
the
eligibility
be
made
more
stringent
that
is
moving
from
half
of
the
meetings
to
three
quarters
of
the
meetings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
60%?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
whatâ€™s
the
basis,
how
do
you
arrive
at
these
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
people
in
this
local
had
qualified?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
out
of
how
many?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
apparently
an
enormous
proportion
of
the
membership
do
find
it
either
difficult
or
for
some
other
reason
do
not
attend
the
meeting?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
the
meetings
are
so
dull?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
okay,
this
union
isn't
doing
nearly
as
well
as
the
voters
of
this
country,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
eligibility
were
increased
that
is
to
60
or
two-thirds
or
three-fourths,
what
is
the
process
by
which
a
local
union
would
make
that
change?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
how
would
it
be
made
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
these
national
conventions,
you
have
the
leadership
of
the
union's
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
non-attenders,
the
people
with
poor
attendance
records
aren't
likely
to
show
up
at
the
national
convention,
are
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
may
they
be
elected
delegates,
if
they
don't
attend,
if
they
don't
meet
this
attendance
requirement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
is
the
other
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
matter
of
all
that
is
essentially,
the
establishment
is
in
control
of
a
national
convention,
using
the
word
establishment
in
quotation
marks,
of
course.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
how
could
these
660
who
didn't
attend
or
the
non-attenders
of
the
660,
get
to
a
national
convention?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
aren't
eligible?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
this
local,
there
would
be,
how
many
26
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
so
as
of
the
time
you
gave
me
the
figure
of
22
numbers
out
of
660?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
the
actual
attendance
record
have
a
bearing
in
evaluating
the
reasonableness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
rupp.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
even
that
assumes,
does
it
not,
that
they
have
got
to
attend
all
the
meetings
after
that,
but
attended
not
in
the
court
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
he
a
plaintiff
in
the
ordinary
sense
or
is
he
a
plaintiff
in
a
representative
sense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
one
way
to
get
at
this
be
to
look
at
the
actual
attendance
records
which
in
this
case,
on
this
record
shows
that
only
22
out
of
660
people
were
eligible
for
a
number
of
union
offices
and
the
secretary
might
have
appropriately
to
answer
this
inquiry,
look
to
what
figures
would
enable
one-fourths,
let
us
say
of
the
660
to
be
eligible
and
then
fix
the
attendance
requirements
to
fit
that
larger
number.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
anymore
a
requirement
now
to
fix
that
thing
is
than
it
was
for
the
judge
who
was
trying
this
case
originally?
the
judge
trying
this
case
originally
was
presented
with
the
negative
question,
is
this
unreasonable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
the
affirmative
of
what
is
reasonable?
if
you
prevail
in
this
law
suit
then
the
secretary
has
the
burden
of
going
forward,
does
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
your
position,
the
government's
position
that
the
secretary
in
the
first
instance
and
the
district
judge
dealing
with
that
in
the
case
is
entitled
to
reach
these
conclusions
on
the
basis
of
the
tendency
of
this
kind
of
an
attendance
rule
to
undermine
democratic
principles
in
the
government
of
unions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
rupp.
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
mr.
frankel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course
i
understood
you
said
it
was
burden
on
those
who
wanted
to
be
candidates?
it
is
a
burden
on
candidacies
as
only
22
are
eligible
which
is
not
a
great
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
do
not
think
that
is
affected
by
these
enormous
number
of
who
do
not
comply
with
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
75-657,
local
union
34-89
of
the
steelworkers
against
usery
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
brennan.
