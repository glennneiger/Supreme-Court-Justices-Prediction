isn't
there
a
possibility
that
the
one
steelworker
who
is
interested
enough
in
the
union
to
go
to
the
meetings
without
tunning
for
office?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
wasn't
that
duty
of
--
you
don't
know
how
many
workers
they
are
like
that,
didn't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
are
enjoying
it,
they
just
like
to
go
to
meeting?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
not
included
in
your
figure?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
how
many
are
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
went
to
one
less
than
number
of
meeting?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
attend
the
12
meetings?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
that's
all
i
have
got.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
rule,
what
degree?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
rupp,
if
i
can
get
you
back
to
my
original
question,
how
could
a
union
lawyer
looking
at
what
you
just
read
me
about
ten
minutes
ago,
and
draw
a
up
a
rule
that
would
be
acceptable?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
--
would
not
it
made
impossible?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
one
that
is
sure
to
pass
muster?
justice
thurgood
marshall
sure
i
said,
that
is
impossible?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
you
studied,
you
worked
with
it,
i
am
not
too
sure
you
could
draw
(inaudible)
under
those
rules
because
they
do
not
say
one
month,
two
months,
six
years,
eight
years,
one
percent,
eleven
percent;
it
has
nothing
that
you
put
your
finger
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
when
you
do
that,
would
you
also
realize
that
this
is
an
international
union
with
how
many
locals?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
are
going
to
get
a
rule
that
this
local,
the
5,000
locals
all
lose
because
of
this
one
local?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
talking
about
that.
i
am
talking
about
not
the
ones
he
brought
suit.
i
am
talking
about
the
other
5,000
because
isn't
your
position
that
this
entire
provision
goes
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
means
all
5,000
locals?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
reasonable
in
the
steelworkers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
reasonable?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that,
what
we
to
decide
whether
it
is
reasonable
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
it
a
part
of
that
could
be
very
well
as
to
what
is
reasonable?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
reasonable?
