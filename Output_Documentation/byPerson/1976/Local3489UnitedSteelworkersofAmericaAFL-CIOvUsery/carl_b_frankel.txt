mr.
carl
b.
frankel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
beginning
in
1964
and
at
each
of
he
biannual
convention
since
then,
the
membership
of
the
united
steelworkers
of
america
has
voted
to
adopt
in
its
present
form
a
meeting
attendance
requirement,
applicable
by
constitution
to
all
of
the
5200
local
unions
which
comprise
the
steelworkers
international.
under
that
rule
to
be
eligible
for
a
local
union
office
in
any
of
the
5200
local
unions,
a
member
must
have
attended
one
half
of
the
regular
monthly
meetings
in
the
three-year
period
preceding
the
election,
the
three-year
period
being
the
term,
a
prior
term
of
office
unless
his
work
or
union
activities
prevent
attendance.
this
case
arises
under
the
section
401
(e)
of
the
labor-management
reporting
and
disclosure
act,
29
u.s.c.
section
481
(e)
which
provide
for
the
right
of
the
member
to
run
for
local
union
office
and
provides
that
that
right
to
subject
to
reasonable
qualifications
uniformly
imposed.
this
case
began
when
one
of
two
defeated
candidates
for
president
of
local
3489
and
its
1970
election
of
officers
challenged
the
validity
of
the
meeting
attendance
requirement
first
internally
within
the
union
and
then
in
the
complaint
filed
with
the
secretary
of
labor.
the
secretary
within
the
time
awarded
by
statute
then
filed
this
law
suit,
attacking
the
meeting
attendance
rule
as
applied
in
the
1970
election
of
local
3486.
the
district
court
following
the
lead
of
the
sixth
circuit
and
four
other
district
courts,
which
all
of
whom
had
passed
on
the
validity
of
the
steelworkers
meeting
attendance
rule,
held
that
our
rule
was
indeed
a
reasonable
qualification
under
the
act.
the
secretary
appealed
to
the
seventh
circuit.
the
seventh
circuit
departing
from
this
line
of
authority,
concluded
on
the
contrary
that
the
rule
was
unreasonable
and
the
conflict
between
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit
is
what
brings
this
case
to
this
court.
well
your
honors,
actually
the
issue
in
this
case
is
a
very,
very
narrow
one,
much
narrower
than
i
had
initially
thought.
upon
reading
briefs,
one
gets
to
appreciate
just
how
narrow
it
is.
i
want
to
emphasize
out
by
starting
with
where
we
and
the
secretary
of
labor
agree.
the
secretary
of
labor
and
the
steelworkers
agree
even
under
the
secretary's
most
recent
regulation
that
it
is
reasonable
under
the
statute
for
unions
to
have
meeting
attendance
rules,
point
number
one
where
we
agree.
the
second
point
to
which
we
agree
is
that
such
rules
serve
valid
union
purposes
and
now
i
am
quoting
the
secretary,
namely
to
ensure
that
candidates
have
demonstrated
interest
in
and
familiarity
with
the
affairs
of
the
organization.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
it's
in
the
regulation
and
in
the
brief.
it's
in
the
secretary's
current
regulation.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
yes,
at
page
15
of
the
secretary's
brief
where
he
paraphrases
the
regulation.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
while
he
issues
an
interpretive
regulation,
it's
published
in
the
cfr.
prior
to
that
there
was
a
manual
which
was
distributed
to
local
unions
where
they
could
follow
what
the
secretary's
interpretations
were.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
they
are
interpretations,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
there
are
no
sanctions.
all
of
that
non-attendance
means
is
that
individual
--
that
the
member
would
not
be
eligible
to
run
for
local
union
office,
if
he
didn't
attend
half
of
the
meetings
that
he
--
or
if
his
work
precluded
his
attendance
he
would
not,
there
would
be
no
sanctions
of
course
and
he
would
still
be
eligible.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
every
month,
your
honor.
but
there
were
two
meetings
so
that
it
was
a
split
meeting,
which
means
of
--
there
are
three
shifts
at
this
plant,
so
that
meant
that
anybody
could
attend
the
meeting.
there
was
one
which
was
held
as
i
recall
on
wednesday
afternoon
and
the
next
was
on
the
thursday
morning,
so
that
everybody
could
attend.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
but
it
was
one
meeting,
it's
considered
one
meeting.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
yes,
the
same
business
would
occur,
would
arise
and
what
they
frequently
do
is
cumulate
the
votes
on
any
issue
on
which
a
vote
has
to
be
taken.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
oh
they
might
not,
that
is
correct.
but
the
reason
for
this
split
meeting
is
so
that
everybody
can
attend
the
meeting.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
work
and
meeting
and
the
union
actively.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
there
is
no
way
of
knowing,
your
honor.
no
one
made
that
check.
the
only
way
of
telling
work
excuses
by
looking
at
all
of
the
employment
records
which
are
in
the
possession
of
the
employer.
i
think
may
be
i
ought
to
explain
the
way
the
steelworkers
operate
and
with
respect
to
the
work
excuse,
we
have
no
reason
to
check
work
excuse
unless
the
members
are
nominated.
if
the
member
is
nominated
and
falls
short
of
the
required
number
of
meetings
then
and
only
then
when
we
will
check
to
see
if
he
had
sufficient
work
excuse
to
qualify
for
office.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
every
three
years.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
member
worked
at
the
time
there
was
a
meeting,
yes.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
that
is
correct.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
there
is
no
reason
to
check.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
then
there
is
a
reason
to
check.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
well
when
we
have
to
find
out
whether
he
worked
on
the
day
on
which
there
was
--
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
oh,
union
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
that
's
correct.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
yes
sir.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
that
is
correct.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
no,
your
honor,
the
tellers
would
do
that.
a
member
could
cooperate
by
saying,
well,
i
think
i
worked
on
such
and
such
day,
but
it
would
be
the
duty
of
the
election
tellers
to
make
a
check
of
those
members
who
were
--
who
did
not
--
who
are
nominated
did
not
meet
the
meeting
attendance
requirement
by
virtue
of
meetings
alone
then
there
would
have
a
finite
number,
it's
usually
a
small
number.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
well,
your
honor,
their
over
time
and
indeed
in
this
particular
case
there
was
one
member
who
qualified
by
virtue
of
a
combination
and
he
had
an
additional,
according
to
the
secretary's
investigation,
he
had
additional
nine
credits
over
16
meetings
which
he
had
attended.
now
the
problem
is
that
the
secretary
did
not
look
for
anyone,
his
investigator
did
not
look
to
see
where
anybody
else
would
have
met
it,
knowing
that
nine,
that
this
one
member
received
name
and
credits
and
there
were
three
members,
he
was
provided
a
list
by
union.
union
gave
a
secretary
a
list
and
said
here
is
all
the
people
who
are
eligible
by
virtue
of
the
meeting
attendance
and
here
are
three
people
who
had
between
15
and
18
meetings
and
it
was
for
those
three
people
that
the
secretary
checked
the
employment
work
records
to
see
whether
or
not
any
of
those
of
three
would
qualify
by
the
virtue
of
the
excuses.
he
found
that
one
did
and
the
testimonial
was
he
had
nine
conflicts,
but
he
didn't
check
through
anybody
else.
now,
if
one
man
had
nine
conflicts,
it's
possible
that
people
who
had
as
many
as
nine
meetings
attended,
other
people
may
also
qualify.
that's
why
i
say,
we
don't
really
know
how
many
members
in
this
local
were
eligible.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
the
tellers
are
either
elected
or
they
are
appointed
subject
to
ratification
by
the
membership.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
at
a
regular
meeting.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
usually,
it's
not
the
nomination
meeting,
but
i
don't
recall
a
constitutional
provision
that
says,
when
it
had
to
be
done.
i
know
in
practice
it's
usually
done
at
the
nomination
meeting
for
which
there
is
a
notice.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
usually
a
month
or
it
could
be
less,
though
it
varies
in
5200
locals
you
have,
--
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
yes.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
well,
your
honor
because
usually
there
are
only
a
few
people
as
to
whom
there
is
a
question
and
it
doesn't
impose
that
much
of
a
burden.
by
the
way
i
would
like
to
contrast
that
with
what
would
happen
under
the
secretary's
approach
which
is,
you
have
to
determine
after
it's
all
said
and
done,
how
many
people
were
eligible
to
find
out
whether
you
are
going
to
apply
the
rule.
well,
if
that's
what
you
are
going
to
do,
then
we
have
locals
from
a
1000
to
20,000
members,
where
there
are
rotating
shifts,
steady
night
shifts,
we
would
have
to
engage
in
an
administrative
nightmare
to
send
that
local
union
people,
camp
them
out
in
the
employers
employment
records
department,
if
they'll
let
us
and
determine
how
many
people
are
eligible
so
that
we
can
decide
whether
or
not
the
rule
is
valid,
given
the
test
that
the
secretary
is
urging
before
this
court.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
some
unions
have
done
that
and
we
would
not,
it
is
our
position
that
such
a
rule
would
be
valid
because
it
imposes
two
heavy
a
burden
on
the
member.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
i
don't
think
60
--
i
don't
think
we
should
require
more
than
half,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
well,
it's
difficult
to
do,
i
agree,
but
i
think
from
the
standpoint
of
our
rule
that
to
ask
a
member
to
spend
an
hour
or
45
minutes,
or
an
hour-and-a-half
or
two
hours
every
other
month
is
not
too
difficult
a
burden
and
that
adds
up
to
roughly
32
hours
in
a
three-year
period.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
by
virtue
of
meeting
attendants
alone,
22.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
about
660.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
i
think,
it's
for
some
other
reason
other
than
for
being
difficult,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
or
because
they
don't
have
the
interest
in
attending.
for
example,
your
honor,
i
would
not
say
that
it
was
difficult
in
united
states
for
citizen
to
vote,
but
in
the
last
election
only
53%
voted
and
--
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
no.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
my
point
is
that
i
don't
think
you
can
measure
the
difficulty
of
the
requirement
by
how
many
choose
to
fulfill
it.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
a
local
union
could
not
make
that
change
in
the
steelworkers,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
it
will
have
to
be
made
at
convention,
at
the
steelworkers'
convention
which
imposes
these
requirements
nationwide
for
all
steelworker
locals
and
from
which
steelworker
locals
are
not,
cannot
deviate.
i
think,
that
by
the
way
your
honor,
i
think
it
should
have
some
fairness.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
in
some
instances,
yes
your
honor.
in
other
instances
the
delegates
are
elected
as
anybody
else
and
it’s
a
--
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
i
would
say
having
attended
five
or
four
of
them
that
the
dissidents
do
attend
meetings,
do
get
elected
to
become
delegate
--
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
yes,
not
this
attendance
requirement.
there
is
another
one.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
as
i
recall,
it's
half
of
the
year.
i
don't
recall
exactly
but
there
is
an
attendance
requirement.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
your
honor,
my
experience
is
that,
that
is
not
true.
i
think
that
the
steel
--
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
well
the
non-attenders
--
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
--
would
not
be
eligible.
that's
correct
from
within
their
own
local
union,
that's
correct,
but
that's
only
--
it's
a
much
smaller,
it
is
a
smaller
term,
but
there
is
a
meeting
as
i
say,
i
believe
--
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
there
is
no
way
to
know
because
nobody
did
a
check
for
a
year.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
that
was
on
a
three-year
basis
and
it
didn't
include
employees
or
members
who
were
eligible
by
virtue
of
combination.
i
don't
know
how
many
of
those
members
would
be
eligible.
there
maybe
many
more,
there
is
no
way
of
knowing.
so
i
am
saying,
as
there
were
22
qualified
by
virtue
of
meeting
attendants
alone,
but
you
can
also
qualify
by
a
combination
of
meeting
attendants
and
work
excuse
and
the
same
thing
would
be
true
for
the
delegates.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
there
are
12
international
unions
representing
approximately
25%
of
the
membership,
of
trade-union
membership
which
have
meeting
attendance
rules.
now
to
use
the
approach
of
the
secretary
--
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
it
does
not.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
no
it
doesn't
suggest
that
for
this
reason,
your
honor.
i
was
giving
you
a
figure
which
represents
those
internationals
which
have
constitutions
which
prescribe
a
meeting
attendance
rule,
but
there
are
--
the
constitutions
of
other
unions
permit
local
unions
to
adapt
meeting
attendance
rules
and
again
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
how
many
of
them
do.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
a
three-year
rule?
i
believe
there
is
one
other
union
that
has
three-year
rule.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
well,
no
your
honor.
i
wouldn't
put
at
that
way,
i
am
sorry
because
if
you
take
the
approach
as
secretary
used
which
is
that
you
measure
the
rule,
the
validity
of
the
rule,
by
how
many
are
eligible,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
one,
two
or
three
units,
but
we
are
in
the
same
boat
as
all
other
unions.
if
that's
the
test
and
that's
the
only
test
he
has
suggested
--
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
well,
there
was
a
union
that
had
a
70%
--
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
we
are
using
the
armed
bargaining.
so
i
suppose,
we
could
--
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
there
is
a
union
that
had
a
75%
rule;
the
glass
bottle
blowers
had
a
75%
requirement
and
there
is
another
way
of
looking
at
stringency,
your
honor
some
unions
require
50%
attendance
in
each
year.
now,
that
may
be
more
stringent
than
50%
over
a
period
of
three
years.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
well,
that
maybe
your
honor.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
it
not
only
to
encourage
meeting
attendance,
your
honor,
but
to
encourage
those
who
oppose
the
leadership
of
the
union.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
well,
it's
hard
to
tell
what
point
there
is
success
and
at
what
point
there
isn't.
if
you
compare
the
percentage
wise,
the
attendance
of
this
local
union,
it
was
slightly
better
than
it
is
in
other
local
unions.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
no
i
have
no
way
of
knowing.
i
am
talking
about
the
locals
which
we
know
about
who
were
litigating
cases,
but
i
would
say
this
your
honor,
the
important
point
from
my
standpoint
is
not
only
the
number,
but
one;
how
can
you
tell
at
what
point
you
have
achieved
sufficient
attendance,
so
that
your
rule
is
valid
in
the
eyes
of
the
secretary,
number
one
and
number
two
the
most
important
feature,
purpose
of
that
rule
is
to
get
those
people
who
are
opposed
to
the
leadership
to
come
to
the
meetings
and
to
do
so
over
the
term.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
no
they
must
decide
whether
they
wish
to
run
for
office
–
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
18
months
in
advance.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
your
honor,
i
have
this
problem.
the
secretary
says
18
months
is
too
long
in
advance.
if
we
had
one-year
rule,
we
would
say
that
that
requires,
that
the
member
has
to
make
his
decision
too
late,
i
really
say
he
has
to
make
it
too
early.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
well,
because
if
the
time
would
have
gone
by
for
him
to
qualify.
if
he
had,
for
example,
a
rule
which
you
had
at
the
last,
in
the
last
year
you
had
to
attend
half
the
meetings,
that's
all.
a
member
may
have
attended
every
meeting
for
two
years
and
i
can
assure
you
the
secretary
would
say
that
if
he
attended
every
meeting
for
two
years
and
now
in
the
last
year
you
are
required
to
attend
half
a
meetings
and
he
doesn't
make
it,
that
would
be
an
invalid
rule.
to
continue
that
we
have
a
--
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
the
problem
i
am
getting
to
is
that
the
secretary
is
also
rescinded
a
--
to
his
original
part,
the
regulation
which
permitted
a
two-year
rule.
so
we
have
--
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
in
order
to
determine
what
is
reasonable,
in
order
to
determine
what
is
reasonable
given
the
fact
that
the
secretary
says,
that
a
meeting
attendance
rule
is
itself
reasonable
then
there
has
to
be
some
measuring
period
and
what
we
are
saying
is
the
secretary
hasn't
given
us
any
way
to
knowing
what
that
measuring,
what
kind
of
appropriate
measuring
period
they
are
giving.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
the
reason
i
would
give
your
honor,
is
that
if
we
didn't
do
that
then
we
will
remove
the
incentive
for
opponents
of
the
leadership
to
attend
early
in
the
term,
in
the
first
18
months,
that
is
the
reason.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
that
is
correct.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
no
meetings
in
the
first
18
months
--
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
or
unless
you
have
work
excuse
during
the
first
18
months.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
i
don't
think
the
secretary
in
this
--
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
you
honor,
i
think
the
test
is
whether
the
rule
is
reasonable
under
the
statue
and
in
making
that
determination
one
must
consider
what
the
secretary
says
and
give
it
a
certain
amount
of
way,
that's
why
we
have
opposed
--
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
i
would
agree
with
that,
have
the
secretary
come
up
with
a
standard.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
pardon?
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
if
the
secretary
had
issued
a
standard
which
unions
could
understand
and
determine
whether
their
rule
was
valid.
i
would
agree
with
that
your
honor.
the
problem
we
have
the
secretary
has
never
articulated
a
standard
which
tells
any
union,
whether
it's
meeting
attendance
rule
will
pass
muster
or
won't,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
no
it
does
not
at
all.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
he
administrates
the
statute
and
--
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
that’s
correct
and
i
am
not
saying,
you
disregard
what
the
secretary
says,
i
am
not
suggesting
that,
but
i
am
saying
that
secretary
has
to
come
up
with
--
with
a
standard
which
tells
labor
unions,
given
the
fact
he
says
meeting
attendance
rules
are
alright,
which
tells
a
labor
union
whether
its
rules
is
reasonable
or
not.
if
you
are
drafting
a
meeting
attendance
rule
with
the
secretary’s
current
standard,
and
we
face
that
problem,
if
you
delegate
trying
to
decide
whether
a
meeting
attendance
rule
is
reasonable
and
the
secretary's
approaching
or
not,
how
would
you
know?
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
not
of
this
rule,
your
honor,
because
the
member
has
it
within
his
power
to
attend
or
not
to
attend
and
the
burden
is
not
an
onerous
one.
if
the
member
didn't
have
it
within
his
power,
if
by
some
pre-ordained
regulation
or
rule,
the
incumbents
had
control
over
who
came
and
who
didn't
or
how
many
people
were
eligible
and
how
many
weren't,
then
i
would
agree
that
the
number
who
meet
the
rule
or
to
choose
to
comply
with
it
that
that
would
be
relevant,
but
if
it's
within
the
member's
free
choice
and
if
the
requirement
not
a
burdensome
one
then
we
don't
think
you
should
be
able
to
judge
the
rule
on
the
basis
of
whether
the
members
choose
to
comply
or
not.
that’s
not
the
reason,
that's
not
the
basis
for
determining
the
validity
of
a
rule.
so
whether
people
comply
with
it
so
long,
so
long,
i
emphasize
very
heavily,
the
meeting
hall
is
accessible
and
the
burden
isn't
asking
too
much
of
the
member.
that's
all
we
are
saying.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
no.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
upon
the
complaint
of
the
member.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
he
decides
to
sue
is
what
he
does
and
---
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
that’s
essentially
your
honor
–
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
well
your
honor,
i
hesitate
to
say
anything
about
antitrust.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
your
honor,
i
would
say
one
concluding
point.
if
we
are
going
to
look
at
effects
why
not
look
to
see
whether
in
fact
the
steelworker
rule
entrenches
local
union
officers.
the
secretary
has
never
done
and
the
facts
are
--
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
entrenches
incumbent
officers,
perpetuates
incumbents
into
office.
the
facts
are
within
the
steelworkers
that
they
are
always
contest.
in
this
case
that
compliant
who
lost
in
that
was
one
of
two
loosing
candidates
in
1970
defeated
incumbent
in
1973
and
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
there
are
wholesale
changes
in
officers
in
this
local,
there
are
wholesale
changes
throughout
the
steelworkers,
one
case
i
tried
local
1299,
an
incumbent
president
had
never
won
up
until
the
date
of
that
trial
and
entire
slates
were
put
into
staff
representatives
were
wiped
up.
the
point
is
that
if
there
is
any
measure,
any
measure
of
rules,
of
whether
the
rule
is
valid
in
terms
of
impact
that
would
be
it
and
not
whether
the
members
choose
to
comply.
thank
you.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
a
couple
of
quick
points.
one,
the
average
attendance
was
47.
i
don't
know
whether
i
have
said
that
at
this
meeting
and
although
only
22
met
the
eligibility
requirement,
there
would
be
average
attendance
at
meeting
was
47.
counsel
for
the
secretary
has
made
a
point
which
i
have
never
heard
the
secretary
make
in
any
of
the
meeting
attendance
cases
until
now
and
that
is
that
our
rule
imposed
a
burden
on
member.
he
has
never
taken
the
position
that
the
requirement
of
attending
one
meeting
every
other
month
was
a
burdensome
requirement
on
members.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
well,
we
get
back
to
the
other
point,
your
honor.
i
have
difficulty
trying
to
conclude
or
concluding
that
a
rule
which
is
not
difficult
for
a
member
to
comply
with
is
unreasonable
because
he
chooses
not
to
comply
with
it.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
they
chose
not
to,
your
honor.
i
mean,
that
is
a
decision
they
had.
so
as
long
as
we
do
not
make
it
difficult
for
them,
they
choose
to
stay
away,
that
is
a
decision
that
they
have
made.
now,
the
other
point
that
the
secretary
has
made
is
that
the
regulation
is
to
guide
unions,
to
furnish
guidance
to
the
unions
and
as
we
pointed
out,
it
does
not
furnish
any
guidance
at
all.
no
one
could
conceivably
draft
a
rule
after
looking
at
that
resolution.
regulation
of
the
secretary
has
issue.
the
other
problem
with
the
impact
that
is
the
members
who
are
eligible,
that
would
disqualify
any
meeting
attendance
rule
because
he
would
not
know,
it
would
be
possible
with
a
one-year
rule,
with
a
two-year
rule
to
have
96
%.
you
could
have
the
simplest
requirement
in
the
world.
mr.
carl
b.
frankel
oh!
i
am
sorry.
thank
you,
your
honor.
