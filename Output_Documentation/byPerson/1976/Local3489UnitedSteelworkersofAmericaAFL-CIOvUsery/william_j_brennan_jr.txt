justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
gather
the,
as
the
meeting
roll
shows
by
name
who
attended?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so
if
he
is
a
nominee
and
you
find
his
name
on
the
meeting
roll
only
18
times
out
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
right.
if
you
find
however
it's
only
12
times?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
you
have
to
find
out
the
days
that
he
was
absent
why,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
it's
something
else
i
gather.
you
said
he
might
have
been
on
union?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
might
for
example
he
might
have
been
member
of
grievance
committee.
on
a
meeting
on
the
grievance
with
an
employer
might
have
coincided
with
a
union
meeting
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
would
be
an
adequate
excuse?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
a
kind
of
inquiry
you
have
to
make,
if
he
falls
short?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
do
not
quite
understand,
if
he
were
--
if
his
excuse
was
that
he
was
working,
i
thought
you
said
there
was
a
split
meeting.
so
that
any
worker
would
be
able
to
attend
one
of
the
other
sessions
of
the
meeting?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
long
in
advance
of
the
elections
is
the
nomination
meeting?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
each
has
it's
own
autonomy
in
that
respect?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
between
the
data
of
nomination
of
the
election
it's
a
very
short
period.
how
do
you
get
all
this
investigating
done
as
to
nominees
as
to
whom
there
is
any
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally
are
there
many?
are
there
internationals
that
have
this
attendance
requirement,
the
eligibility
for?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
suggested
75%.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
organized
labor,
do
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any,
have
a
rule,
the
kind
of
part
of
the
steelworkers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
didn't
dunlop
suggested
maybe
it’s
more
than
just
a
little
difference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
didn't
dunlop
and
bachowski
suggested
that
more
than
little
difference
has
to
be
given
to
secretary's
determination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
it
entrenches
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
what
the
secretary
considered
why,
as
it
predicate
to
whether
or
not
he
is
going
to
file
the
suit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
only
reason
why
he
considers
these
things?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
when
a
particular
case
comes
up,
he
goes
through
this
process
that
you
have
described
for
us,
only
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
is
going
to
file
a
law
suit,
does
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
many
of
the
23
are
incumbents?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
almost
a
half.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
decision
cited?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
usery?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
circulated
copies
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
the
provision
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
steelworkers
of
america
limiting
eligibility
for
local
union
office
to
members
of
the
local
who
had
attended
at
least
one
half
of
the
local's
regular
meetings
for
three
years
previous
to
the
election
of
officers
did
not
violate
§401(e)
labor-management
reporting
and
disclosure
act
which
provides
that
every
union
member
in
good
standing
shall
be
eligible
to
be
a
candidate
in
the
whole
office
subject
however
to
reasonable
qualifications.
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
in
reserved.
we
hold
that
where
a
meeting
attendance
requirement,
as
was
the
case
of
this
one,
resulted
an
exclusion
of
96
and
a
half
percent
of
petition
of
local's
members
from
candidacy
for
office.
the
requirement
cannot
be
considered
a
reasonable
qualification
consistent
with
title
4
goal
and
free
and
democratic
union
elections
since
the
requirement
having
that
result,
restricts
the
free
choice
of
the
membership
and
selecting
its
leaders.
mr.
justice
powell
joined
by
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
dissents
and
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
