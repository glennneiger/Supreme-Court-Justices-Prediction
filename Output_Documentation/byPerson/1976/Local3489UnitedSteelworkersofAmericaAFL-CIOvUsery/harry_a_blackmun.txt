mr.
frankel,
i
find
some
indecision
or
difference
in
the
brief
in
records.
how
often
did
this
local
have
it
meetings,
it's
regular
meetings,
every
month?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
had
some
excuses
here,
didn't
you,
it
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
many
people
would
have
qualified
by
virtue
of
the
excuses?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
can
you
do
that
nine
months
ago?
i
suppose
you
have
annual
elections,
don't
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
every
three
years,
so
that
you
have
to
go
back
36
months
to
shore
up
your
excuses?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
who
has
to
bear
that
proof,
the
member?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
means
the
steelworkers
in
the
other
union
are
farthest
out?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
let
me
emphasis
the
other
fact.
the
50%
rule
plus
the
three-years
is
the
most
stringent
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
because
somebody
has
to
be
up
in
front.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
don't
you
admit
that,
there
is
not
anything
nefarious
about
it,
i
just
wanted
to
get
into
focus?
