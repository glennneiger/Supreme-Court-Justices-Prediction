justice
potter
stewart
the
quote
you
are
quoting
the
secretary
and
when
he
is
--
and
where
did
he
say
that?
justice
potter
stewart
current
regulation
and
it's
also
in
the
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
that's
not
true
if
you
have
attended
every
meeting?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
it’s
right.
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
my
brother
stevens
has
correctly
stated
the
question
before
us,
but
i
would
rather
thought
it
wasn't
whether
or
not
this
union
rule
is
reasonable
but
whether
or
whether
or
not
the
secretary
was
justified
under
the
statute
in
finding
that
it
was
reasonable
and
there
may
be
a
differences
so
like
a
jury
verdict.
justice
potter
stewart
isn’t
that
the
question
rather
than
the
one
that
is
posed
by
my
brother
stevens?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
question
is
posed
by
my
brother
stevens
didn’t
describe
anyway
to
the
secretary's
determination.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
would
agree
that
some
difference
at
least,
some
difference
must
be
given
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
he
does
administrate
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
surely
something
must
flow
from
that,
we
don't
administer
the
act?
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
you
mr.
rupp
have
burden
of
proof
and
wasn't
i
mistaken
a
while
ago
when
i
said
that
mr.
justice
stevens
had
perhaps
not
stated
the
issue
correctly.
i
think
he
did
state
it
correctly.
this
is
not
administrative
proceeding,
this
was
a
law
suit
in
which
you
had
the
burden
of
proof,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
whether
not
you
proved
that
these
were
not
reasonable?
justice
potter
stewart
why,
why
you
are
just
apply
for
a
law
suit
under
the
act,
don't
you?
you
have
a
burden
proving
it.
you
don't
have
any
assumption
in
your
favor,
do
you
under
this
statute
or
am
i
mistaken?
justice
potter
stewart
anymore
than
the
justice
department
is
when
it
brings
an
anti-trust
suit,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
the
administration
of
anti-trust
laws
that
justice
department
do,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
do
then
concede
that
you
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
in
a
federal
court?
justice
potter
stewart
but
an
individual
can
sue
under
anti-trust
laws?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
true
i
suppose
lots
of
litigation
is
settled
before
it's
gets
to
court.
isn't
that
true
that
the
legislative
history
of
this
1959
legislation
indicates
the
purpose
of
this
provision
was
to
guard
against
the
unfair
or
inequitable
continuation
in
office
of
incumbent
union
leadership?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
wasn't
that
the
purpose?
justice
potter
stewart
in
order
to
accomplish
that
basic
legislative
purpose,
in
order
to
avoid
the
risk
of
unfairly
or
inequitably
continuing
incumbent
leadership.
is
that
right?
that
was
a
purpose,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
shouldn't
that
therefore
be
the
focus
of
the
secretary's
inquiry
as
to
any
rule
and
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
reasonable
to
find
out
whether
it
would
tend
to
perpetuate,
unfairly
perpetuate
incumbent
union
leadership
and
he
could
determine
that
by
normal
rational
predictive,
intellectual
processes
or
to
which
would
be
contributed
to
the
past
history,
wouldn't
that
be
true?
and
not
a
word
of
what
you
read
us,
that
bureaucratic
(inaudible)
mentioned
anything
about
the
tendency
to
perpetuated
an
office
incumbent
union
leadership,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
by
looking
at
the
record,
that
is
how
you
prove
it.
that
there
has
been
or
has
been.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
they
were
not
maintained
in
office,
then
you
would
know
that,
in
any
event
incumbent
leadership
had
not
been
maintained
in
the
office?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
in
fact
the
record
show
they
had
not
been,
you
would
not
need
to
take
step
two,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
had
not
been
retained,
then
that
would
be
the
end
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
may
just
passing
the
office
back?
justice
potter
stewart
my
basic
question
was
simply
this.
if
i
am
correct
and
i
used
to
tell
me
that
i
am
in
my
understanding
of
the
what
the
legislative
history
shows
to
be
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
i.e.
to
prevent
the
continuation
office
of
incumbent
leadership
by
unfair
means
then
why
shouldn't
the
focus
of
the
secretary's
inquiry
in
determining
whether
or
not
these
are
reasonable
rules
be
whether
or
not
they
have
the
tendency
to
promote
that
purpose
that
congress
thought
was
undesirable?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
putting
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
wrong
party
when
you
make
that
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
have
the
burden
of
proving
that?
justice
potter
stewart
in
a
court?
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
sit
down,
there
is
no
constitutional
question
involved
in
this
case,
is
there?
