rehnquist
when
you
say
regulation,
do
you
mean
it
is
the
part
of
the
interpretive
bulletin?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
secretary
give
an
authority
by
congress
to
issue
regulations
the
way
the
sec
have
enforced
the
law
or
are
these
just
interpretation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's,
what
that
says?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
was
the
same
thing
be
duplicated
on
thursday
morning
as
went
on
wednesday
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
take
the
people
that
came
thursday
morning
wouldn't
get
the
benefit
of
the
discussion
in
that
area
that
took
place
wednesday
afternoon.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
union,
if
you
averaged
80
or
90%
attendance
at
the
meeting,
you
have
could
count
on
the
members
when
they
cast
their
ballots
at
election
to
realize
that
the
one
of
the
candidates
had
never
come
to
meetings
and
wasn't
that
very
good
bet.
but
if
you
get
10%
of
the
candidates,
10%
of
the
enrollment
at
the
meetings,
the
typical
man
casting
his
ballot
for
a
union
also
it
doesn't
really
have
an
idea
whether
anyone
else
can,
i
mean,
because
he
probably
didn't
come
himself.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
401
(e)
says
nothing
about
any
authority
of
the
secretary
to
decide
what's
reasonable,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
is
no
previous
administrative
determination
he
makes
is
binding
on
you
in
the
absence
of
a
court
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
is
the
assistant
attorney
general
under
the
anti-trust
division?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
just
leaves
them
at
sea,
it
seems
to
me.
if
you
look
at,
it
is
a
question
of
fact,
the
trial
judge
here
found
it
was
reasonable,
it
is
a
kind
of
thing
that
you
say
it
is
like
a
jury
determination.
now
obviously
you
do
not
mean
that
and
if
it
is
not
a
fact
question
or
jury
determination
type
of
thing,
it
ought
to
be
capable
of
some
articulation
of
these
people
are
going
to
be
guided?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
have
upheld
a
15-year
residency
of
requirement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
15-year
residency
requirement
would
do
the
simply
like
florida
or
arizona.
