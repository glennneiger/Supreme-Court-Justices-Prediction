mr.
allen
v.
bowles
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
one
comment
i
might
make
before
i
start
and
it
really
is
not
determinant
of
this
case
as
far
as
the
idaho
death
penalty
itself
is
concerned
so
that
is
presently
on
appeal
and
expectedly
overturned.
so,
i
would
like
to
address
just
a
moment
this
indian
matter,
the
one
and
essential
element
that
must
to
be
present
for
an
individual
to
come
within
this
federal
jurisdiction
is
the
fact
that
he
be
an
indian
that
in
addition
to
be
an
enrolled,
you
could
be
adopted
by
the
tribe
and
still
not
come
within
the
jurisdiction.
and,
as
has
been
stated
by
the
us
government
here,
that
the
indian
who
comes
within
the
federal
jurisdiction
here
is
treated
and
know
differently
than
any
one
else
who
comes
within
federal
jurisdiction,
but
i
think
the
point
we
have
to
make
is
that
the
reason
that
that
person
is
within
the
federal
jurisdiction
is
because
of
his
indian
blood.
add
that
to
his
enrolment
in
the
tribe
and
the
location,
but
there
is
that
one
essential
element
that
is
necessary
and
which
brings
him
within
the
federal
jurisdiction
of
statute.
mr.
allen
v.
bowles
that
is
correct,
there
is
a
(inaudible)
race,
yes,
but
you
have
to
have
the
race
before
you
get
into
that.
mr.
allen
v.
bowles
that
is
correct.
yes,
it
is
absolute
and
necessary.
now,
the
decisions
of
course
and
as
the
development
of
law
down
through
the
time
we
started
dealing
with
indians
has
assumed
this
wardship
doctrine
and
the
purpose
of
that
of
course
was
to
assist
and
benefit
the
indian.
i
think
it
as
the
court
stated
in
the
us
v.
kagama
case
in
1886
that
from
the
weakness
and
helplessness
so
largely
do
to
the
course
of
dealing
of
the
federal
government
with
them
and
the
treaties
that
have
been
promised
to
them,
there
arises
a
duty
of
protection.
i
think
from
that
duty
of
protection,
of
course
this
is
also
with
that
is
the
power
for
the
legislation,
but
from
that
duty
of
protection
under
the
mancari
case
where
they
were
given
the
advantage
in
employment.
their
duty
of
protection
to
promote
the
indian’s
ability
to
function
on
their
own
is
promoted
by
that
and
as
a
legitimate
purpose
under
the
duty
of
protection
which
came
out
of
the
kagama
case
and
was
later
however,
in
the
united
state
versus
the
klamath
case
in
1938
we
find
that
this
wardship
doctrine
and
the
duty
that
the
federal
government
has
to
the
indian
is
however
subject
to
constitutional
limitations.
so
what
we
are
saying
in
essence
is
that
it
is
necessary
to
have
this
indian
blood
which
puts
you
into
the
federal
jurisdiction,
applies
a
standard
to
you
which
does
not
apply
to
any
other
defendants
in
that
state
assuming
a
non-indian
victim
and
non-indians
defendant.
mr.
allen
v.
bowles
tribe,
that
is
correct.
mr.
allen
v.
bowles
i
think
there
we
would
be
going
along
with
the
entire
policy
in
dealing
with
indians
of
trying
to
recognize
what
we
term
their
independent
sovereignty
and
you
would
be
getting
into
an
area
which
was
not
only
raised
what
was
more
emphatically
this
political
subdivision
type
of
situation.
mr.
allen
v.
bowles
i
would
view
it
is
a
different
case,
yes.
now,
in
a
recent
case
in
1973
of
keeble
v.
the
united
states,
the
language
within
that
decision
as
congress
extended
federal
jurisdiction
to
crimes
committed
by
indians
on
indian
land
out
of
a
conviction
that
many
indians
would
be
civilized
a
great
deal
sooner
by
being
under
the
federal
criminal
laws
and
taught
to
regard
life
and
the
personal
property
of
others.
then
a
quotation
from,
i
do
not
seem
to
have
the
congressman
here,
but
this
is
emphatically
not
to
say,
however,
that
congress
intended
to
bribe
indian
defendants
of
procedural
rights
guaranteed
to
other
defendants.
of
course
for
this
comment
it
does
not
exclude
just
defendants
in
the
federal
courts
or
to
make
it
easier
to
convict
an
indian
than
any
other
defendant
and
i
think
this
is
a
justification
for
the
type
of
application
that
we
have
in
the
antelope
case
would
have
to
show
that
this
type
of
treatment
is
beneficial
to
the
indian
under
our
duty
of
protection
to
the
indian.
and
they
are
making
it
easier
to
convict
the
indian
than
you
do
to
any
other
citizen
say
within
the
state
of
idaho,
are
we
protecting
the
indian,
are
we
benefiting
the
indian
to
make
it
easier
for
him
to
eventually
we
hope
melt
into
society
and
take
his
place
there
as
all
other
citizens
of
the
state
of
idaho
or
any
other
state?
mr.
allen
v.
bowles
well,
i
think
it
can,
but
still
subject
to
our
constitutional
limitations.
mr.
allen
v.
bowles
i
think
it
has
to
benefit
the
indian
if
our
purpose
in
having
the
power
and
authority
over
the
indian
is
to
protect
them
and
to
benefit
them.
mr.
allen
v.
bowles
they
will
be
self-governing
at
that
point
whether
the
federal
having
the
power
and
authority
over
them.
mr.
allen
v.
bowles
i
think
it
depends
on
what
way
we
are
going
to
go
and
there
seems
to
be
a
lot
of
fluctuation
throughout
the
years
as
far
as
dealing
with
the
indians
is
concerned.
are
we
going
to
recognize
their
sovereignty
as
much
as
possible
or
are
we
going
to
continue
the
wardship
doctrine
and
to
their
benefit
to
take
more
rights
away
from
them
by
furthering
legislation
such
as
expanding
18
1153
from
the
original
seven
major
crimes
to
a
larger
number
that
we
now
have?
so
we
keep
eroding
their
sovereignty
by
assuming
more
jurisdictions
over
them
and
actually
taking
away
their
sovereignty
whereby
our
process
and
what
is
recognized
in
williams
v.
lee
in
1959
case,
the
congress
has
followed
a
policy
calculated
eventually
to
make
all
indians
full
pledged
participants
in
american
society
and
it
contemplates
criminal
and
civil
jurisdiction
over
indians
by
a
state
ready
to
assume
those
burdens,
as
soon
as
the
educational
economic
status
of
indians
permit
the
change
without
disadvantage
to
them.
mr.
allen
v.
bowles
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
allen
v.
bowles
but
whether
or
not
it
is
acceptable
as
a
question
earlier
for
the
jurisdiction
be
left
to
the
tribal
council,
i
think
hence
on
how
we
are
going
to
go
one
way
or
the
other
and
recognizing
sovereignty
or
taking
away
(inaudible).
mr.
allen
v.
bowles
that
is
correct,
i
would
agree
with
that.
one
other
case
that
i
would
like
to
mention
here
is
the
us
v.
cleveland
case
which
is
was
a
ninth
circuit
case
decided
in
1974
and
in
that
case
there
was
a
difference
in
treatment
between
indian
and
non-indians
defendants
based
on
whether
he
was
an
indian
or
non-indian
and
also
both
parties,
whether
indian
or
non-indian
defendants
were
tried
under
federal
jurisdiction.
as
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
on
this
case,
the
government
should
not
be
allowed
to
do
through
a
procedural
matter
what
they
are
not
allowed
to
do
through
a
sustentative
matter
such
as
was
the
case
in
united
states
v.
cleveland
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
it
is
of
course
again
pointed
out
to
one
essential
element
as
being
of
the
indian
blood
in
order
to
fit
into
the
jurisdictional
scheme
which
applies
a
different
standard
to
the
defendant
in
this
case
than
it
would
been
have
had
that
defendant
been
a
non-indian.
so,
if
we
were
to
ask
that
the
court
in
this
case
affirm
the
ninth
circuit’s
opinion,
finding
that
this
is
a
racial
classification
in
that
the
guardianship
interest
that
the
us
government
has
in
the
indian,
in
the
indian
nation,
especially
in
the
state
of
idaho
and
the
coeur
d’alene
tribe
and
coeur
d’alene
reservation
is
not
benefited
by
the
18
1153
statutory
scheme
which
brings
the
indian
under
federal
jurisdiction
and
the
felony
murder
rule.
thank
you.
