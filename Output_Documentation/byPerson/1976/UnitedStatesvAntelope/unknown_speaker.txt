unknown
speaker
all
three
of
the
defendants
were
indians?
unknown
speaker
what
about
an
act
committed
a
non-indian
in
the
same
circumstances
on
the
same
reservation?
unknown
speaker
even
if
it
is
a
so-called
major
crime
and
even
if
it
is
committed
on
an
indian
reservation?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey
what
is
the
rule
if
a
reservation
indian
is
killed
off
the
reservation?
unknown
speaker
no
federal
dimension
to
that
at
all?
unknown
speaker
and
how
about
an
indian
committing
a
crime
off
the
reservation,
the
same?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
so
if
a
non-tribal
indian
commits
a
crime
or
he
has
a
crime
committed
against
him
on
a
reservation?
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
why
you
say,
it
is
a
blend
of
geographical
or
political
area
and
the
identity
of
the
perpetrator?
unknown
speaker
in
this
very
case
one
might
be
rather
hard
put
to
it
to
decide
which
was
the
more
lenient
rule
because
as
i
think,
i
heard
you
say
earlier
in
your
argument
that
while
idaho
does
not
have
a
felony
murder,
it
does
have
first-degree
murder
punishable
by
death.
unknown
speaker
the
evidence
of
this
case
might
as
well
support
the
first-degree
on
ordinary
common
law
first-degree
murder
conviction
and
that
would
have
been
punishable?
unknown
speaker
certainly
the
punishment
would
not
have
been,
but
the
proof
of
conviction
would
have
been
more
difficult.
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
show
deliberation
and
premeditation
as
well.
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
it
is
even
clearer
that
if
the
death
penalty
was
available
in
that
state
and
had
been
imposed,
we
would
not
here
at
all.
unknown
speaker
the
statute
looks
fairly
clear
the
way
it
is
written,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
defendant
was
a
white
man
and
he
had
killed
an
indian
and
that
the
white
man
came
to
you
would
you
be
here
making
the
same
argument?
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
he
would
not
have
the
advantages
of
the
state
law.
unknown
speaker
so
would
you
be
making
a
racial
discrimination
claim
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
because
he
is
white,
is
it
or
not
or
because
he
killed
an
indian
or
because
he
committed
a
crime
against
an
indian?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
any
different
than
the
united
states
ceding
jurisdiction
to
the
puerto
rico
to
have
its
own
crime
system
rather
than
having
the
federal
statutes
decide
what
should
be
crimes
in
puerto
rico?
unknown
speaker
but
doesn’t
public
law
280
require
the
state
to
take
advantage
of
it
to
make
certain
commitments
to
treat
the
indians
equally
or
favorably,
it
is
not
just
a
session
by
its
own
turn?
unknown
speaker
but
having
the
number
of
states
that
could
have
qualified
under
public
law
280
declined
to
do
so
because
they
did
not
want
to
perform
the
other
side
of
the
bargain?
unknown
speaker
mr.
walker,
under
idaho
state
law
there
is
a
death
penalty
possibility,
is
there
not?
unknown
speaker
you
want
to
subject
your
clients
to
that?
unknown
speaker
then
i
take
it,
you
would
not
be
happy
if
we
were
to
decide
in
the
interest
of
equality
that
all
indians
and
non-indians
are
to
be
tried
in
state
court.
you
want
the
benefit
of
either
one?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
mancari
carried
that
the
statute
conferred
a
benefit
on
the
indians,
but
it
conferred
a
detriment
on
the
whites.
if
you
are
arguing
racial,
certainly
the
thing
upheld
in
morton
against
the
mancari,
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
opinion
was
something
that
favored
to
the
indians
and
disfavored
the
whites.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
the
fact
that
it
benefited
indians
makes
it
easier
to
defend
than
if
it
had
benefited
whites?
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
one
of
your
arguments
was
that
it
conferred
a
benefit
rather
than
a
detriment?
unknown
speaker
mr.
walker,
if
we
affirm
the
ninth
circuit,
would
it
not
be
possible
in
future
for
a
white
man
to
raise
the
same
question
in
all
of
that
equal
protection?
unknown
speaker
and
if
we
agree
with
that
would
not
the
old
criminal
law
be
confused?
unknown
speaker
then
it
would
have
to
be
done
by
congress?
we
could
not
do
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
going
back
if
you
will
for
a
moment
mr.
walker
to
your
colloquy
with
my
brother
rehnquist
about
whether
or
not
this
is
racial,
as
i
understood
mr.
frey
and
perhaps
i
misunderstood
him,
i
mean,
he
said
that
--
let
us
assume
a
mohican
indian
who
lives
up
in
new
york
state
and
goes
for
vacation
out
here
on
this
coeur
d'alene
indian
reservation
just
as
any
other
tourist
and
he
committed
this
offense.
he
would
be
treated
not
as
an
indian,
would
he
not?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
not
racial,
it
is
just
indian,
unless
i
misapprehended,
means
a
member
of
the
tribe
who
operates
that
reservation,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
that.
to
be
eligible
to
be
a
member
of
the
tribe
you
have
to
be
an
“indian.”
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
not
all
indians,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
my
visiting
new
york,
i
would
not
be
in
indian,
even
though
it
would
in
this
definition
and
even
though
he
is
in
fact
an
indian.
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
not,
that
is
how
we
were
talking
about
all
people
of
a
certain
race.
it
is
only
people
who
are
politically
members
of
this
tribe,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
or
at
least
a
segment
of
the
whole?
unknown
speaker
and
if
a
member
of
this
tribe
were
visiting
a
reservation
in
south
carolina,
he
would
not
be
in
indian
if
he
committed
this
offense
on
that
reservation,
would
he?
unknown
speaker
you
are
getting
into
your
colleague’s
time,
counsel.
unknown
speaker
if
he
committed
murder
in
the
city
of
chicago;
he
would
be
tried
in
the
state
court.
the
other
reason
is
own
reservation.
unknown
speaker
but
under
the
old
cliché
having
indian
blood
is
a
necessary,
but
not
a
sufficient
condition?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bowles
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
basic
theory?
as
i
understand
that
there
are
three
possible
jurisdictions
that
might
try
them;
in
the
state,
the
federal
government
or
the
tribe?
unknown
speaker
would
you
make
the
same
argument
if
the
jurisdictions
were
committed
to
the
tribe
and
the
tribe
had
a
more
severe
penalty
than
the
state?
unknown
speaker
so
the
answer,
did
you
say
that
would
be
a
different
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bowles
if
political
reasons
could
justify
ceding
jurisdiction
with
tribe
why
cannot
political
reasons
justify
ceding
jurisdiction
to
federal
government
as
opposed
to
state
government?
unknown
speaker
political
considerations
must
be
those
which
favor
the
indians.
unknown
speaker
if
the
transfer
is
to
the
federal
government,
but
not
if
it
was
transferred
to
a
tribal
authority.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
it
will
all
be
subject
to
the
ultimate
federal
statutory
scheme,
i
suppose
it
would
be
dependent
on
that
on
the
last
analysis
even
if
they
was
transfer
of
jurisdiction
to
a
tribe,
is
what
i
am
saying,
you
see
this
would
be
primary
acceptable
even
though
it
might
prejudice
a
particular
indian
defendant
that
you
do
not
find
it
acceptable
the
transfers
from
the
state
to
them.
unknown
speaker
but
the
fact
is
that
the
congress
has
over
the
years
followed
a
variety
of
quite
different
and
consistent
policies
in
different
areas,
has
it
not?
sometimes
it
is
very
sharp.
unknown
speaker
back
in
the
50s
there
was
a
policy
of
assimilation
and
by
the
60s
there
was
a
policy
of
protecting
the
identity
of
separateness
of
the
indians,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
is
quite
an
inconsistent;
it
is
the
inconsistency
and
the
concepts
of
treating
an
indian
tribe
as
a
quasi
sovereign
nation
like
england
or
france
on
the
one
had
and
treating
indians
as
wards
of
the
state
who
need
protection
on
the
other
that
is
a
quite
an
consistent
policy
and
yet
each
has
been
reflected
in
the
actions
of
congress
and
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
over
the
years.
unknown
speaker
of
the
mohican
tribe
in
new
york.
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
is
a
non-tribal
indian
living
in
chicago?
unknown
speaker
then
he
would
not
be
an
indian
within
--
unknown
speaker
but
the
mohican
indians
in
new
york
building
those
high
skyscrapers,
they
do
not
need
any
help
from
the
federal
government?
unknown
speaker
they
live
right
in
new
york
city.
unknown
speaker
he
own
the
reservation.
unknown
speaker
the
offence
has
to
be
in
indian
country.
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
i
have
to
confess.
i
do
not
quite
understand
the
importance
of
this
fact
that
there
is
some
indians
against
whom
that
if
you
call
it
discrimination
does
not
apply.
would
your
case
really
be
any
different
if
all
indian
were
subject
to
the
same
definition?
you
would
make
the
same
argument.
unknown
speaker
but
you
cannot
say
that
discrimination
on
the
race
which
would
normally
be
bad
would
be
saved
by
the
fact
that
there
was
some
members
of
the
race
were
not
victimized
by
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
of
course
it
is
true
then
we
have
to
face
the
fact
if
this
defendant
were
of
any
other
race,
he
would
be
subject
to
different
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
unless
he
is
(inaudible),
if
it
changes
race
then
you
get
a
different
result.
unknown
speaker
you
change
the
victim’s
race
and
you
come
back
to
this
result.
unknown
speaker
or
you
should
make
other
changes,
but
if
you
make
that
change
and
no
other.
unknown
speaker
but
if
this
defendant
were
of
the
different
race
the
result
would
have
been
different
and
all
other
facts
the
same.
unknown
speaker
but
we
must
acknowledge
that
to
be
true.
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
you
never
have
disputed
that.
unknown
speaker
you
concede
a
while
ago
that
there
was
a
racial
over
tone
here,
but
i
take
it
your
position
is
it
if
there
is
a
racial
discrimination
that
is
benign.
