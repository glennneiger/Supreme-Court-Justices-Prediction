mr.
john
w.
walker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
the
respondent
davisonâ€™s
position
that
the
statutory
framework
of
18
u.s.c.1151,
1152
and
1153
when
read
together
provide
an
impermissible
racial
discrimination
in
that
when
certain
conduct
is
perpetrated
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
an
indian
reservation,
that
prohibited
conduct
treats
the
perpetrator
differently
depending
upon
the
race
of
the
victim
and
the
race
of
the
perpetrator.
in
this
instance
for
example,
the
victim
was
non-indian
and
the
defendant
was
indian
and
as
a
consequence
under
18
u.s.c.
1153
of
the
major
crimes
act,
these
indian
defendants
were
in
federal
court
facing
18
u.s.c.
1111
which
is
the
federal
homicide
statute.
mr.
john
w.
walker
under
1152
mr.
justice
that
would
still
be
a
matter
for
a
federal
court
determination.
mr.
john
w.
walker
i
believe
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
w.
walker
i
do
not
believe
that
i
would
be
able
to.
mr.
john
w.
walker
well,
it
is
possible
that
the
hypothetical
position
that
you
pose
or
situation
you
pose
might
also
be
subject
to
the
same
argument
that
we
are
adapting
here.
i
have
not
and
possibly
i
should
have
considered
that.
it
is
seems
to
me
that
in
reaching
the
question,
this
statutory
framework
differs
from
any
other
than
i
am
aware
of
than
the
federal
system
in
that
not
only
are
you
considering
the
territory
involved,
but
you
were
also
in
conjunction
with
that
considering
the
race
of
the
individuals
involved,
more
specifically
the
race
of
the
defendant.
actually
in
trying
to
decide
which
form
you
are
going
to
be
in
and
there
are
three
possibilities.
there
can
be
tribal
court.
there
can
be
state
court
and
there
can
be
federal
district
court
as
a
matter
of
original
jurisdiction
and
there
are
four
things
that
need
to
be
considered
in
order
to
make
the
determination.
one
is
the
location
of
the
offense
whether
it
was
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
an
indian
reservation
that
is
covered.
secondly,
the
race
of
the
victim
and
the
race
of
defendant
and
thirdly
the
conduct
that
is
being
considered
whether
it
comes
within
1153
or
not.
fourthly,
you
have
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
state
in
which
the
conduct
was
perpetrated
is
a
state
which
is
affected
by
public
law
280.
now,
this
is
another
matter
that
further
goes
to
complicate
the
question
and
that
is
that
public
law
280
allowed
six
days
at
the
inception
to
have
total
jurisdiction
over
all
offenses
committed
on
indian
reservations.
for
example,
in
california,
i
do
not
believe
there
are
any
excluded
reservations
in
california,
in
minnesota,
i
believe
there
was
one
that
excluded,
but
in
california
for
example,
under
the
same
facts,
since
california
was
a
public
law
280
state,
this
entire
trial
would
have
been
in
california
state
court
as
opposed
to
federal
court
because
it
is
a
public
law
280
state.
mr.
john
w.
walker
well,
the
significance
of
public
law
280
in
our
view
is
that
one
of
the
justifications
for
this
racial
consideration
that
is
posed
by
the
government
is
the
fact
that
the
united
states
government
has
a
wardship
or
trust
responsibility
towards
indians
and
the
contention
is
that
this
can
only
be
furthered
by
having
trial
in
federal
district
court
to
protect
them
from
the
capriciousness
or
the
discrimination
that
might
exist
in
state
courts
and
by
congress
then
enacting
public
law
280,
they
have
more
or
less
abandoned
in
our
view
this
justification.
mr.
john
w.
walker
well,
there
is
not
a
different
criminal
justice
standard
in
state
of
california
for
indians
that
differs
from
that
for
non-indians.
if
there
is
i
assume
that
it
is
subject
to
some
constitutional
attack.
mr.
john
w.
walker
yes,
mr.
justice
that
is
correct.
now,
as
the
public
law
280
is
amended,
it
requires
the
legislature
and
the
tribe
in
the
state
both
consent
to
this.
i
think
the
import
of
public
law
of
208
however,
is
that
it
rejects
in
my
mind
the
contention
that
the
only
way
to
further
the
trust
responsibility
that
the
federal
government
has
or
the
wardship
doctrine
is
by
having
a
federal
district
court,
the
court
of
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
w.
walker
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
w.
walker
the
answer
to
that
question
mr.
justice
is
that
under
the
decisions
rendered
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit
has
looked
at
two
phases
of
the
substantive
crime.
one
is
the
burden
of
proof
that
the
prosecution
must
meet
and
secondly
they
look
at
the
severity
of
the
punishment
and
when
they
have
found
discrimination
based
upon
race,
they
have
opted
to
give
the
indians
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
so
in
this
instance
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
the
ninth
circuit
standard
or
opinion
in
effect
the
respondents
in
this
instance
would
be
given
the
benefit
of
the
burden
of
the
idaho
homicide
statute
and
i
would
assume
then
the
benefit
of
the
punishment
provision
contained
within
the
federal
homicides
statute.
i
understand
the
question
that
you
pose
and
i
understand
the
difficulties
that
it
would
present.
mr.
john
w.
walker
naturally,
the
problem
is
if
you
assume
a
conviction
then
we
would
not
want
the
death
penalty
naturally,
but
what
the
effect
of
this
district
court
decision
was,
before
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
it,
was
that
it
made
conviction
easier
and
in
effect
it
was
easier
because
of
the
race
of
the
defendants.
naturally,
if
you
assume
that
there
could
be
a
convention
hat
under
either
one
of
the
statutes
then
we
would
not
be
happy
with
the
death
penalty
situation,
but
here
the
standard
that
the
government
had
to
meet
was
a
lesser
standard
and
as
a
consequence
they
did
not
have
to
prove
premeditation
in
order
to
obtain
the
convictions.
i
do
not
think
there
can
be
any
question,
but
that
the
classification
here
is
racial.
there
has
been
in
the
briefs
a
contention
made
by
the
government
that
there
is
a
political,
social
status
or
relationship
here
and
they
have
cited
the
mancari
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
mancari
case
was
very
limited
in
its
holding
in
that
in
that
first
of
all
it
was
applied
only
to
civil
bureau
of
indian
affair
hiring
preferences,
it
did
not
go
to
the
criminal
situation
and
additionally
it
conferred
a
benefit
as
opposed
to
a
detriment.
it
seems
to
me
then
that
if
you
do
agree
that
the
statute
on
its
face...
mr.
john
w.
walker
correct.
mr.
john
w.
walker
no,
i
am
suggesting
that
the
holding
of
that
case
was
narrow
and
that
the
government
is
trying
to
take
this
political
social
theory
and
take
it
from
the
civil
realm
and
from
the
employment
preference
realm
and
apply
it
to
the
criminal
realm
as
well.
mr.
john
w.
walker
that
is
correct
and
in
instances
where
a
benefit
has
been
conferred,
the
cases
coming
from
the
ninth
circuit
have
held
that
there
is
no
standing
for
the
indian
to
complain
when
there
is
discrimination,
when
he
is
benefited
by
the
discrimination.
for
example
there
was
a
case
where
there
was
a
difference
between
the
federal
and
state
definition
for
the
rate
statute
and
the
indian
defendant
filed
an
appeal
on
equal
protection
grounds
and
the
court
held,
yes
there
is
a
difference,
but
the
difference
is
to
your
benefit
and
if
it
is
to
your
benefit
you
have
no
cause
to
complain.
mr.
john
w.
walker
i
would
say
that
it
would
certainly
be
possible,
but
it
will
depend
upon
what
congress
has
reply
to
the
decision.
mr.
john
w.
walker
i
would
say
that
there
would
be
one
way
for
the
court
to
rule
in
which
there
would
be
no
differences
in
the
substantive
definition
and
that
has
already
been
done
in
part.
in
1153,
the
substantive
definition
of
the
crime
is
relegated
to
the
state
definition
in
certain
instances.
it
is
now
13
major
crimes
in
1153.
some
of
those
are
relegated
to
the
state
definition.
mr.
john
w.
walker
the
situation
that
you
pose
is
certainly
a
possibility
mr.
justice.
if
you
assume
--
mr.
john
w.
walker
he
would
be
tried
in
state
court.
mr.
john
w.
walker
well,
the
cases
have
held
that
you
cannot
become
enrolled
unless
you
are
an
indian.
mr.
john
w.
walker
so,
maybe
it
is
racial.
mr.
john
w.
walker
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
john
w.
walker
as
i
understand
it
that
would
be
correct.
you
would
have
to
be
an
enrolled.
mr.
john
w.
walker
it
might
be,
if
you
will
excuse
the
expression
in
a
leak
racial...
mr.
john
w.
walker
right,
it
would
not
apply
to
the
entire.
mr.
john
w.
walker
as
i
understand
the
case
decisions
that
would
correct.
mr.
john
w.
walker
i
did
not
see.
