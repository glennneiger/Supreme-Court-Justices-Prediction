mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
reversing
respondent’s
conviction
for
first
degree
murder
on
equal
protection
grounds.
this
case
began
when
respondents
broke
into
the
home
of
emma
johnson,
an
84-year-old
non-indian
woman
who
lived
on
coeur
d’alene
indian
reservation
in
idaho.
they
robbed
her
and
then
they
kicked
and
beat
her
to
death.
because
respondents
are
indians
and
the
crime
occurred
in
the
indian
country
and
because
the
offences
were
among
those
enumerated
in
the
so
called
major
crimes
act,
the
crimes
came
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
district
court.
respondents
were
indicted,
tried
and
convicted
of
burglary,
robbery
and
felony
murder
and
i
talk
here
about
respondents
antelope
and
leonard
davison,
actually
respondent
william
davison
was
convicted
only
of
second
degree
murder
and
the
reversal
of
his
conviction
appears
to
be
inadvertent
and
not
based
on
any
of
the
reasons
given
by
the
court
of
appeals.
respondents
appealed
their
first-degree
felony
murder
convictions
to
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
all
three,
yes.
they
are
actually
four
participants
in
the
crime.
one
testified
on
the
behalf
of
the
prosecution
and
is
not
involved
in
this
appeal.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
on
the
grounds
that
the
conviction
violated
equal
protection
concepts
embodied
in
the
fifth
amendment
by
allowing
respondents
to
be
convicted
of
felony
murder
that
is
without
requiring
the
proof
of
premeditation
or
deliberation
when
a
hypothetical
non-indian
committing
the
same
crime
would
have
been
tried
under
idaho
law,
which
has
no
felony
murder
provision.
parenthetically,
i
note
that
idaho
used
to
have
a
felony
murder
provision
identical
to
the
federal
provision
and
that
provision
was
dropped
about
four
years
ago
when
idaho
adopted
a
mandatory
death
penalty
for
first-degree
murder.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
jurisdiction
would
depend
upon
the
identity
of
the
victim
and
i
will
outline
the
jurisdictional
possibilities
as
i
proceed
with
the
argument.
the
court
of
appeals
perceived
the
situation
that
i
have
described,
the
racial
discrimination
against
the
indians,
which
it
found
not
supported
by
any
compelling
governmental
interest.
i
think
it
is
best
to
begin
the
discussion
of
the
legal
issues
in
this
case
by
outlining
the
current
status
of
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
crimes
committed
in
indian
country.
if
an
indian
commits
a
crime
against
the
person
or
property
of
another
indian,
jurisdiction
over
the
offense
is
within
the
tribal
courts,
unless
the
offense
is
one
of
the
major
crimes
enumerated
in
18
u.s.c.
1153
in
which
case
jurisdiction
is
in
federal
court
under
federal
law.
if
an
indian
commits
a
crime
against
a
non-indian,
essentially
the
same
status
applies,
except
that
if
it
is
not
a
major
crime
and
he
has
been
punished
by
the
tribe,
there
would
be
no
federal
court
jurisdiction,
if
he
has
not
been
punished
by
the
tribe,
there
would
be
federal
court
jurisdiction
under
section
1152.
now,
if
a
non-indian
commits
a
crime
against
a
non-indian,
section
1152
appears
on
its
face
to
grant
federal
jurisdiction
over
that
offense.
however
in
a
long
line
of
decisions,
beginning
with
the
united
states
against
mcbratney
in
1881
and
going
through
the
draper
case
and
new
york
ex
rel
ray
in
1945,
this
court
has
held
that
the
states
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
this
category
of
offenses.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
is
treated
as
though
it
were
committed
elsewhere
in
the
state
and
not
within
an
indian
country
for
purposes
of
jurisdiction.
so,
the
situation
is
if
an
indian
is
involved,
either
as
perpetrator
or
victim,
it
is
either
federal
or
tribal
jurisdiction,
if
only
non-indians
are
involved
in
the
transaction
there
is
state
jurisdiction.
what
has
now
emerged,
there
is
a
coherent
overall
structure
under
which
full
recognition
is
given
to
the
paramount
federal
and
tribal
responsibility
for
regulation
when
indians
or
indian
interests
are
involved,
while
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
maybe
recognized
over
events
occurring
within
the
boarders
of
the
state,
not
implicating
indian
interest,
even
though
the
events
may
take
place
in
indian
country.
what
has
become
clear
as
this
court’s
indian
jurisprudence
has
evolved
therefore
is
the
central
notion
of
the
allocation
of
jurisdiction
between
the
federal
government
and
the
states
is
strongly
rooted
in
the
presence
or
absence
of
impact
on
the
interests
of
tribal
indians.
now
along
comes
the
ninth
circuit
and
holds
that
this
guiding
principle
developed
by
this
court
is
unconstitutional
in
its
application
to
a
large
category
of
cases;
that
is
all
cases
involving
crimes
against
the
person
or
property
of
non-indians.
what
it
is
considered
carefully
then
what
this
discrimination
as
the
ninth
circuit
found
is
and
perhaps
more
importantly
what
it
is
not.
the
federal
murder
statute
under
which
respondents
were
convicted
is
plainly
not
racially
discriminatory
on
its
face
and
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
i
assume
that
the
term
indian
and
the
jurisdictional
statute
is
a
racial
term,
although
we
actually
dispute
that
proposition.
any
person
committing
felony
murder
within
an
area
of
federal
jurisdiction,
indian
or
not
is
guilty
of
first-degree
murder.
this
applies
to
a
non-indian
who
murders
an
indian
in
indian
country.
this
applies
to
a
non-indian
who
commits
felony
murder
on
a
federal
enclave
such
as
a
military
reservation
or
commits
felony
murder
in
a
vessel
on
the
high
seas.
indeed,
the
application
of
the
felony
murder
statute
to
indians
by
virtue
of
section
1153
reflects
not
a
discrimination
with
regard
to
indians,
but
an
affirmative
determination
by
congress
to
treat
indians
the
same
way
as
all
other
persons
within
federal
criminal
jurisdiction
are
treated.
the
discrimination
comes
about
then
not
because
congress
has
decreed
that
indians
and
non-indians
who
commit
felony
murder
shall
be
treated
differently
in
any
respect,
but
simply
because
it
has
allowed
the
states
to
assert
jurisdiction
when
no
indian
is
involved
in
a
crime
either
as
victim
or
perpetrator.
now
inevitably,
when
some
cases
are
allocated
to
the
jurisdiction
of
one
sovereign
and
others
to
a
different
sovereign,
there
will
be
differences
in
a
definition
of
offense,
differences
in
the
procedure
and
evidentiary
rules
governing
the
trial
of
the
case
and
differences
in
the
punishment
provided.
it
is
these
differences
that
are
the
product
of
this
jurisdictional
allocation
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
invidiously
discriminatory.
this
case
is
thus
entirely
different
from
the
cleveland
line
of
cases
relied
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
heavily
relied
upon
by
respondents
here.
cleveland
involved
a
situation
in
which
an
indian
is
the
victim
of
an
assault
and
thinking
about
this
case,
it
can
be
very
confusing
and
i
think
one
point
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
what
we
might
call
the
antelope
category
of
cases
all
involved
in
non-indian
victims
or
we
might
call
the
cleveland
category
of
cases
all
involved
indian
victims.
now,
under
the
provisions
of
section
1153
as
there
were
in
effect
at
the
time
of
cleveland
decision,
if
an
indian
assaulted
an
indian,
state
law
was
referred
to
provide
substance
of
law
and
punishment.
however,
if
a
non-indian
assaulted
an
indian,
1152
applied
and
federal
law
governed
and
there
were
differences
which
resulted
in,
for
instance
in
the
cleveland
case,
a
larger
punishment
being
inflicted
on
an
indian
defendant
than
could
have
been
on
a
non-indian
defendant.
but
the
key
factor
in
the
cleveland
case
is
that
both
groups
of
defendants
were
tried
in
federal
court
and
that
congress
had
established
the
standards
by
which
both
groups
should
be
judged
and
the
status
of
the
defendant
as
indian
or
non-indian
was
the
critical
factor
that
activated
either
state
law
or
federal
law
applying
as
a
matter
of
affirmative
congressional
enactment.
now,
this
direct
discrimination
would
pose
a
difficult
case
and
it
would
be
legitimately
subject
to
some
of
the
objections
wrongly
made
so
that
procedures
in
the
present
case.
in
the
present
case,
the
discrimination
derives
as
i
have
said,
solely
from
the
division
of
jurisdiction
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government.
in
order
for
this
court
to
sustain
the
result
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals,
it
must
conclude
that
this
eminently
sensible
division
of
responsibility
which
has
so
often
been
endorsed
by
this
court,
which
allows
the
states
to
apply
their
law
in
their
courts
when
no
federal
interest
is
importantly
implicated,
but
retains
the
federal
governance,
the
situation
where
trust
responsibilities
to
the
indian
tribes
are
involved,
but
this
sensible
allocation
of
jurisdiction
is
impermissible
because
state
law
is
different
from
federal
law.
we
submit
of
course
that
this
wholly
non-invidious
allocation
of
jurisdiction
by
a
congress
and
by
this
court
is
fully
consistent
with
the
equal
protection
obligations
imposed
upon
congress.
now,
i
think
it
is
plain
that
we
need
not
carry
the
burden
that
respondents
would
thrust
upon
us
of
showing
a
compelling
governmental
interest
to
sustain
the
allocation
of
jurisdiction
that
exists
in
this
case.
but,
i
would
like
to
outline
for
the
court,
the
choices
that
would
be
available
to
congress
if
the
court
of
appeals’
rejection
of
the
present
system
for
administering
criminal
justice
in
indian
country
is
upheld
by
this
court.
first
of
all,
congress
could
do
nothing.
such
a
case,
each
prosecution
for
a
crime
against
a
non-indian
and
indian
country
would
be
governed
by
a
patch
work
assortment
of
the
most
lenient
features
of
the
state
and
federal
law.
for
example,
if
a
peace
officer
is
murdered
in
the
course
of
a
felony
in
state
of
idaho
in
an
indian
country,
the
defendant
could
not
be
convicted
of
first-degree
felony
murder
because
idaho
has
no
such
provision,
only
the
federal
law
does.
presumably,
however,
the
defendant,
if
an
indian
could
not
be
convicted
of
murder
of
a
peace
officer
which
is
first-degree
murder
under
idaho
law
because
federal
law
has
no
such
provision.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
would
be
within
the
state
jurisdiction.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
is
none
under
present
statute,
possibly
congress
could
adapt
the
statute.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
same
thing
goes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
of
course
the
only
indians
in
our
view
who
are
subject
to
jurisdiction
on
the
reservation
under
the
definition
of
indian
in
1152
and
1153
are
tribal
indians
not
canadian
indians,
not
indians
from
terminated
tribes
only
so,
but
we
suggest
that
it
is
not
really
basically
a
racial
but
more
a
political
definition,
although
we
recognize
there
is
a
racial
component.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
would
be
treated
as
a
non-indian
for
purposes
of
the
statute.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
right
and
of
course
race
is
relevant.
the
existence
of
indian
blood
or
non-existence
of
indian
blood
is
a
relevant
factor,
but
it
is
not
necessarily
determinative
factor
in
deciding
who
is
an
indian
and
who
is
not.
but
in
our
view
it
does
not
matter,
even
if
indian
is
a
racial
term,
we
think
it
is
plain
that
the
arrangement
that
congress
and
this
court
have
evolved
over
the
years
is
completely
justifiable
and
does
not
work
any
invidious
discrimination.
i
would
like
to
give
another
example
of
what
happens
under
the
court
of
appeals
decision
as
we
understand
and
that
that
is
the
situation
in
which
an
insanity
defense
is
available.
and
let
us
say
that
the
state
definition
of
insanity
is
more
lenient
or
liberal
than
the
federal
definition
of
insanity.
yet
on
the
other
hand
let
us
say
that
the
state
has
as
oregon
had
at
least
at
one
time
a
requirement
that
the
defendant
prove
insanity
rather
than
the
federal
requirement
that
the
government
bear
the
burden
of
proving
sanity
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
presumably,
again,
under
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion,
you
would
have
to
pick
the
state
definition
of
insanity
and
federal
burden
of
proof.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
correct.
the
evidence
was
sighted
that
this
possibly
be
defense.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
would
not
have
been
more
lenient
in
our
view.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
in
order
to
convict
the
first-degree
murder.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
it
was
imposed.
i
doubt
that
the
idaho
statute
in
fact
could
survive
the
north
carolina
decisions
last
year,
but
in
principle,
we
are
talking
theoretically
now
and
the
fact
is
that
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
for
instance
the
manslaughter
statutes.
the
federal
statute
has
two
degrees
of
manslaughter
with
certain
punishment
prescribed.
the
idaho
statute
has
four
degrees
of
manslaughter,
ranging
from
punishments
considerably
less
than
the
federal
punishment
up
to
punishments
considerably
more
than
the
maximum
federal
punishment.
now,
i
do
not
how
you
compare
these
two
systems
to
determine
which
is
more
lenient.
in
any
event,
it
seems
to
me
plain
that
the
result
of
the
ninth
circuit’s
holding
is
that
no
coherence
system
of
legal
rules
is
applied
and
the
potential
for
responding
litigation
over
a
choice
of
law
is
virtually
endless.
now,
congress
would
have
two
alternatives
to
this
chaotic
system.
the
first
is
to
abandon
federal
supremacy
in
the
area
and
the
trust
responsibility
to
the
indian
tribes
by
either
(1)
turning
all
prosecutions
over
to
the
state
courts
under
state
law
which
is
what
has
been
done
in
the
pl
so
called
pl
280
states.
now,
there
was
a
time
at
the
time
pl
280
was
adapted
when
the
sentiment
in
congress
was
very
much
in
favor
of
the
simulation
of
indians
and
pl
280
was
a
product
of
that
and
in
five
or
six
dates
there
is
in
fact
state
jurisdiction.
there
since
was
a
reaction
to
that
and
then
the
indian
civil
rights
act
in
1968,
congress
drew
back
from
that
approach
and
determined
that
the
tribes
should
have
a
say
in
the
turnover
of
jurisdiction
to
the
states
because
many
of
the
tribes
where
extremely
reluctant
to
see
their
members
subject
to
state
court
jurisdiction
and
state
law
and
prefer
to
maintain
the
existing
system.
also,
of
course
congress
could
adapt
an
assimilative
crime’s
approach
under
which
all
indian
defendants
and
now
we
are
talking
about
the
category
of
cases
in
which
non-indians
are
victims,
under
which
all
the
indian
defendants
would
be
governed
by
state
law.
now,
if
this
is
what
is
required
by
the
so-called
equal
protection
violation
that
we
have
in
this
case
it
is
a
strange
principle
because
it
basically
says
that,
yes,
court
has
recognized
over
and
over
again
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
dispute
that
there
exists
a
wardship
or
trust
responsibility
towards
the
tribal
indians,
but
the
only
congress
can
exercise
this
responsibility
is
to
advocate
its
own
law
making
functions
and
simply
say
whatever
the
states
do
will
govern
the
indians.
now,
there
is
a
second
alternative
approach
and
that
is
the
federal
law
is
everything
and
is
to
bring
to
either
for
this
court
to
overrule
the
mcbratney,
draper
line
of
cases
or
for
congress
to
overrule
it
by
statute
and
bring
all
wholly
non-indian
transactions
in
indian
country
within
federal
court
jurisdiction.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
true,
but
in
mcbratney
what
the
court
said
was
that
the
statute
was
implicitly
repealed
by
the
colorado
enabling
act
which
admitted
the
state
on
equal
footing
and
there
has
been
a
lot
of
criticism
of
this
line
of
cases,
but
it
is
fairly
well
embedded
in
our
jurisprudence
now
and
i
think
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense
and
i
would
think
that
this
court
should
only
as
a
last
resort,
only
if
it
finds
that
it
cannot
escape
the
result
reached
by
the
ninth
circuit
should
it
consider
the
possibility
of
overruling
the
mcbratney
line
of
cases.
now,
with
regard
to
the
federalizing
result,
there
are
some
practical
problems
that
i
think
make
it
an
unsatisfactory
course,
although
possibly
one
that
congress
would
decide
to
adapt.
one
is
that
many
reservations
have
a
large
percentage
of
non-indian
population.
in
fact,
coeur
d'alene
indian
reservation
on
which
this
murder
occurred
has
2500
non-indian
residents
and
only
450
indians,
so
it
is
over
80%
non-indians.
that
is
true
of
a
number
of
other
reservations.
the
result
is
that
matters
in
which
there
is
no
serious
federal
interest
would
be
thrust
upon
the
federal
court
system,
thrust
upon
the
united
states’
attorneys
and
the
martial
service
to
deal
with,
it
would
be
a
substantial
added
burden
that
is
difficult
in
my
view
as
a
practical
matter
to
justify
in
terms
of
the
federal
interest
involved.
at
the
same
time,
i
think
it
has
an
unjustified
effect
on
the
states,
one
that
congress
would
be
reluctant
having
in
the
enabling
act,
admitted
the
states
with
jurisdiction
over
wholly
non-indian
transactions.
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
the
proposition
of
this
should
not
be
taken
away
from
the
states
unless
congress
or
perhaps
this
court
finds
any
compelling
federal
interest
for
altering
that
allocation
of
responsibility.
now,
what
we
come
down
then
is
what
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
has
done,
it
has
picked
some
concepts
which
have
merit
in
other
context,
the
notion
that
there
is
should
not
be
a
racial
discrimination
in
the
administration
of
criminal
law
and
that
where
statutes
discriminate
between
individuals
on
the
basis
of
race
that
discriminate
could
only
be
justified
if
at
all
by
showing
a
compelling
governmental
interest
then
it
is
imported
those
considerations
into
an
area
where
they
really
do
not
fit,
where
they
really
do
not
belong
and
where
they
really
have
most
unfortunate
and
unnecessary
results.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
indians
are
treated
unfairly
under
the
present
allocation
of
jurisdiction.
they
are
treated
the
same
way
in
this
case
that
non-indians,
any
place
within
federal
criminal
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states
are
treated
and
i
believe
there
are
no
grounds
for
finding
of
an
equal
protection
violation.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
in
my
time.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
a
couple
of
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
i
think
i
should
say
with
respect
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
stewart
asked,
if
i
left
the
misimpression
i
apologize,
but
it
is
our
view
that
the
mohican
indian
if
he
is
a
member
of
the
tribe,
if
he
is
a
tribal
indian
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
mohican
tribe
would
be
subject
to
federal
indian
country
jurisdiction.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
he
is
not
a
tribal
indian,
if
he
is
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
wherever
he
lives,
if
he
was
a
member
of
a
terminated
tribe,
i
think
the
klamath
indians
for
instance
were
terminated
by
congress,
it
does
not
exist
as
a
tribe
anymore,
he
is
racially
an
indian.
he
is
not
an
indian
for
purposes
of
the
statute,
but
the
case
is
not
quite
as
easy
for
us,
as
your
question.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
they
are
not
necessarily
indians.
the
question
is
not
simply
whether
the
tribe
exists,
but
whether
these
people
continue
to
be
members
of
the
tribe.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
congress
has
made
a
judgment
which
involves
some,
when
you
draw
a
line
they
are
going
to
be
some
individual
instances
on
one
side
of
the
line
where
you
might
feel
it
unnecessary.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
do
not
have
to
live
on
the
reservation.
the
fact
is
that
they
can
live
off
the
reservation,
but
they
may
still
be
getting
benefits
from
allotments,
trust
payments
and
other
kinds
of
benefits
that
derive
from
their
status
was
a
tribal
indians.
they
may
still
be
tribal
indians
even
if
they
do
not
live
on
the
reservations.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
has
to
be
in
an
indian
country.
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
would
still
make
all
but
one
argument.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
it
is
a
question
of
whether
you
characterized
it
as
truly
being
a
racial
discrimination
in
this
court
as
recognized
by
mancari
for
instance
that
it
is
a
political
not
a
racial.
although,
it
overlaps
with
the
racial
group
and
i
think
it
is
important
because
i
think
what
is
happened
in
this
case
the
reason
we
lost
in
the
ninth
circuit
is
that
ninth
circuit
was
engaging
in
this
kind
of
characterization
by
label.
they
classified
the
case
as
a
racial
discrimination
case.
now,
we
say
well
it
does
not
matter
even
if
it
is,
but
we
also
say
that
it
is
not
a
racial
discrimination.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
he
committed
this
particular...
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
change
his
status.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
is
true
but
if
you
just
make
one
change
maybe
the
race
of
the
defendant,
but
you
do
not
have
to
change
his
race.
all
you
have
to
do
is
change
his
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
but
you
could
take
a
person
who
is
still
an
indian,
but
who
is
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
that
does
not
necessarily
mean...
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
agree
that
if
this
defendant
were
a
non-indian
whether
that
is
racial
or
political
i
do
not
know,
but
if
you
were
non-indian
he
would
have
been
tried
in
state
court.
now,
with
respect
to
the
point.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
we
do
not
dispute
that.
we
do
not
think
there
is
anything
wrong
with
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
is
certainly
at
least
neutral,
but
i
do
not
think
it
has
to
be
benign,
it
is
neutral
and
it
is
in
further
interest
of
congress’
responsibility
and
i
find
the
notion
in
referring
to
the
cleveland
case
mr.
bowles
talked
about
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
i
find
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals
quite
extraordinary.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
the
government
should
not
be
permitted
to
accomplish
their
discriminatory
jurisdiction
what
it
cannot
do
through
discriminatory
statutory
coverage.
to
hold
otherwise
would
allow
the
government
to
run
rush
out
over
the
fifth
amendment
in
the
name
of
jurisdictional
sacrosanctity
employing
jurisdiction
as
in
violate
tool.
well,
the
ninth
circuit
is
talking
as
though
congress
set
about
to
decide
how
it
could
be
discriminate
against
the
indians
and
impose
burdens
on
them
that
are
not
imposed
on
non-indians
and
decided
to
use
the
mechanism
of
jurisdiction,
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth
in
this
case
and
i
think
that
concept
that
the
ninth
circuit
apparently
has
just
has
no
place
in
this
area.
now,
mr.
justice
marshall
raised
a
point
when
mr.
walker
was
arguing
about
the
effect
of
the
decision
on
state
proceedings
and
i
like
to
emphasize
that
in
my
view
the
same
rule
would
apply
if
you
had
a
non-indian
defendant
and
he
were
tried
in
state
court
for
an
offense
committed
in
the
indian
country
against
a
non-indian
victim.
i
do
not
see
why
he
would
not
have
the
same
argument
any
lenient
features
of
federal
law
he
would
be
entitled
to,
so
that
the
decision
impacts
is
not
only
on
the
administration
of
federal
criminal
justice,
but
also
in
the
administration
of
state
criminal
justice.
we
also
do
not
say
as
mr.
walker
suggested
that
the
only
way
that
the
congressional
tribal
responsibility
towards
the
tribes
can
be
furthered
by
federal
jurisdiction.
what
we
say
is
what
this
court
said
in
the
sever
(ph)
case
that
rests
with
congress
to
determine
when
guardianship
relation
shall
cease.
here
congress
is
determined
that
on
the
coeur
d’alene
indian
reservation
it
shall
not
cease
and
federal
jurisdiction
shall
be
maintained.
one
other
point,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
wardship
or
trust
doctrine
requires
leniency.
this
notion
that
a
benefit
to
the
indians
is
to
select
out
the
most
lenient
features
of
two
legal
systems
or
the
notion
that
congress
cannot
benefit
the
indian
interest
by
applying
a
coherent
body
of
federally
established
law
seems
to
be
mistaken
and
there
are
after
all
indians
living
on
the
reservation
besides
these
respondents
and
their
rights
and
interests
are
also
affected
by
the
disposition
that
is
made
of
the
respondent’s
criminal
activity.
thank
you
very
much.
