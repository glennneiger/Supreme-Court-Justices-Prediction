mr.
gerald
c.
kops
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
here
on
behalf
of
the
city
of
madison,
joint
school
district
no.
8
and
the
city
of
madison
board
of
education,
the
appellants
in
this
action.
this
case
is
on
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
the
appellants
drew
into
question
for
the
validity
of
a
state
statute
as
applied
and
interpreted,
and
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
upheld
the
statute
after
specifically
considering
the
appellant?s
constitutional
challenge.
thus,
this
court?s
jurisdiction
is
invoked
under
title
28,
section
1257
(2)
of
the
united
states
code.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
a
state
labor
statute,
as
interpreted
and
applied,
may
constitutionally
mandate
that
certain
individuals
be
excluded
from
speaking
in
a
public
form
and
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
content
of
a
proposed
speech.
the
facts
may
be
briefly
stated
as
follows:
the
city
of
madison
board
of
education
is
a
public
do
elected
public
body
charged
with
a
possession,
care
and
control
of
the
school
affairs
of
the
city
of
madison
school
district.
the
board
holds
regular
meetings
on
the
first
and
third
monday
of
every
month.
the
board
has
determined
that
each
report
at
a
portion
of
each
of
its
regular
meetings
will
be
devoted
to
the
receipt
of
public
comment.
this
portion
of
the
agenda
is
denoted
in
the
agenda
as
public
appearances.
at
its
regular
meeting
of
december
6th
1971,
a
number
of
people
were
allowed
to
address
the
board.
among
those
was
the
president
of
madison
teachers
incorporated,
the
teacher
union.
the
president
spoke
and
presented
a
petition
to
the
board,
asking
for
a
quick
resolution
in
the
current
bargaining
talks
that
were
occurring.
after
the
president
of
the
teachers?
union
spoke,
albert
holmquist,
another
teacher,
was
allowed
to
address
the
board.
he
spoke
about
an
item
that
was
being
negotiated
between
the
board
and
mti
and
presented
the
results
of
a
survey
of
the
teaching
staff
and
then
circulated
within
the
schools.
after
completion
of
its
regular
meeting,
the
board
retired
into
executive
session
and
discussed
the
status
of
their
then
current
negotiations
with
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
of
the
teachers.
at
that
executive
session,
they
prepared
directions
for
their
negotiators,
the
superintendent,
and
adjourned.
the
following
day
a
negotiation
session
occurred.
assistant
superintendent
and
superintendent
gave
the
directions
or
proposals
of
the
board
to
the
teachers?
representatives
and
discussion
ensued.
discussion
concluded
with
tentative
agreement
when
the
teachers
accepted
the
board?s
proposal.
formal
agreement
was
finally
ratified
between
the
parties
about
a
week
later
on
december
14th,
1971.
approximately
one
month
later,
madison
teachers
incorporated
filed
a
complaint
with
the
wisconsin
employment
relations
commission.
it
alleged
that
the
board
of
education
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice
when
it
allowed
albert
holmquist
to
speak
at
his
public
meeting.
the
wisconsin
employment
relations
commission
concluded
that
the
board?s
activity
at
its
public
meeting
constituted
prohibited
labor
practice
and
issue
the
following
order.
the
board
shall
immediately
cease
and
desist
permitting
employees
other
than
representatives
of
madison
teachers
incorporated
to
appear
and
speak
at
meetings
of
the
board
of
education
on
matters
subject
to
collective
bargaining
between
it
and
madison
teachers
incorporated.
the
commission
decision
and
order
were
affirmed
by
the
circuit
court
in
wisconsin.
on
appeal
to
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
just
stayed
writing
the
majority
decision
and
noting
specifically
that
all
the
parties
involved
in
this
case
had
conceded
that
speaking
in
the
form
of
negotiating
or
bargaining
could
be
constitutionally
restricted
to
the
exclusive
representative
of
the
teachers.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
i
believe
that
the
board
is
able
to
assert
the
claim
not
only
on
behalf
of
mr.
holmquist
but
also
on
its
own
behalf.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
i
am
not
aware
of
any
decision
like
that,
however,
your
honor.
in
this
particular
case,
the
order
itself
runs
against
the
members
of
the
board
of
education
as
a
sub-division
of
a
state.
i
do
not
know
of
any
other
where
that
has
occurred.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
yes,
that
is
correct.
this
case
is
unusual
in
that
the
board
of
education,
as
the
public
body,
is
asserting
its
right
to
listen
and
envied
its
obligation
to
listen
to
not
only
its
employees,
but
other
citizens.
that
was
the
primary
reason
for
adopting
the
public
appearance
section
of
its
own
agenda
that
it
could
ensure
that
it
would
receive
or
provide?
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
the
federal
right
of
free
speech,
first
amendment.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
we
are
asserting
the
right
of
mr.
holmquist
to
speak
and
our
right
also
to
receive
the
information
regarding
a
matter
of
public
policy
from
the
citizenry.
in
that
sense,
it
is
the
individual
right
of
mr.
holmquist.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
that?s
the
first
amendment.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
that
is
correct.
in
fact,
the
public
body,
under
these
circumstances,
almost
has
an
obligation
to
listen.
they
have
created
a
public
forum
by
the
creation
of
a
public
hearing
section.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
no,
the
board
of
education
created
the
public
forum
here
by
setting
aside
a
part
of
its
meeting
to
receive
public
comment,
setting
up
a
public
hearing
at
each
of
its
regular
meetings.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
i
think
that
the
board
of
education
can
close
its
meetings.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
i
think
that
the
state
legislature
could
mandate
that
but
they
haven?t
done
that
in
this
case.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
well,
yes
but
without
real
as
we
suggest
without
real
substance
or
backing
to
the
rationale
of
their
decision.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
they
are
subject
to
the
limitations
of
the
first
amendment?
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
yes,
of
course
they
are,
as
public
officials
they
take
an
oath.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
they
raised
the
question
of
standing
when
we
sought
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
however,
this
court
has
not
noted
probable
jurisdiction
and
did
not
reserve
the
issue
of
standing
for
consideration.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
it
is
not
argued
in
the
briefs
of
the
respondent.
on
appeal,
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
just
stayed
writing
a
majority
opinion
noted
that
the
parties
had
conceded
but
negotiation
or
bargaining
for
a
labor
agreement
could
be
constitutionally
restricted
to
the
majority
representative
of
the
teachers
and
indicated
that
the
basic
question
was
whether
the
activities
of
the
board
at
its
public
meeting
constituted
bargaining
with
a
minority
group
of
employees.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
that
is
one
of
the
suggestions
i
think
that
can
be
drawn
and
we?ve
drawn
that
or
concluded
that
on
the
basis
of
your
decision
and
would
be
strictly
that
that
possibility
does
arise,
although
these
are
not
the
exact
facts.
in
that
case,
the
court
suggested
that
if
the
board
of
education
knowingly
violated
the
constitutional
rights
of
its
students,
it
may
be
subject
to
a
personal
liability
action.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
i
am
not
certain
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
well,
this
is
not
a
regulation
of
time,
place
and
manner,
your
honor.
this
is
a
total
and
complete
prohibition
of
the
exercise
of
a
particular
forum
on
a
selected
basis.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
yes,
not
just
this
agenda
though,
each
and
every
board
meeting.
this
was
part
of
its
regular
meetings.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
they
were
twice
monthly.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
no.
but
let
me
suggest
in
response
to
that,
sir.
in
those
circumstances,
it
would
be
something
similar
to
this.
the
example
of
somebody
shouting
fire
in
a
theatre,
and
then
passing
a
restriction,
closing
the
theatre
instead
of
punishing
the
conduct.
in
other
words,
i
am
suggesting
that
if
the
public
forum
is
going
to
be
closed,
it
must
be
closed
to
everybody
and
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
has
not
said
that.
it
is
only
close
to
a
particular
group
based
on
content
of
what
they
might
say.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
no.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
a
private
meeting
at
which
nobody
was
barred.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
at
part
of
the
executive
session
the
following
day,
they
held
a
negotiation
session,
representatives
of
the
teachers
and
the
board.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
that
is
correct.
they
barred
everybody
from
that
meeting.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
well,
i
am
not
saying
that
they
could
not
have,
sir.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
the
open
meeting
was
not
a
negotiation
session.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
your
honor,
they
heard
from
a
number
of
people.
they
heard
from
about
six
or
seven
people
that
evening;
talk
to
them
on
public
affairs.
this
wasn?t
just
a
matter
of
open
meeting
for
the
purpose
of?
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
absolutely
not,
sir.
it
was
a
regular...
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
the
president
of
the
union
was
there
because
of
the
exigencies
in
the
current
bargaining
situation.
there
were
about
300
or
400
other
teachers
in
the
meeting
too.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
no,
they
were
not
there
to
bargain.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
no,
i
didn?t
say
there
was
a
bargaining
atmosphere
at
that
meeting.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
the
teachers
and
the
board
have
been
negotiating
since
about
january
of
1971.
this
was
december
and
a
contract
had
not
been
reached.
in
passing
these
private
bargaining
sessions
had
occurred.
these
private
bargaining
sessions,
where
the
boards
sits
down
with
the
teachers?
representatives,
was
not
this
particular
meeting.
this
particular
meeting
was
a
regular
board
meeting
and
in
each
meeting,
whether
it
was
in
1970
or
1971,
there
was
a
part
of
the
meeting
set
aside
for
public
appearances.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
i
do
not
recall
if
prior
to
that
year
anybody
discussed
this.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
no,
it
didn?t,
in
fact,
the
bargaining
session
with
the
teachers
was
scheduled
before
the
public
meeting.
it
was
a
regularly
scheduled
bargaining
session
that
was
to
occur
the
following
day
with
the
representatives
of
the
teachers.
i
think
the
public
meeting
and
the
executive
session
and
then
immediately
following
a
private
negotiation
session
with
the
exclusive
representative,
indicates
the
difference
between
the
forms
we
had.
in
the
public
meeting,
everybody
was
allowed
to
speak,
and
the
board
was
allowed
to
listen
and
did,
in
fact,
in
this
case,
merely
listen.
the
following
day
of
the
negotiation
session,
the
board
did
not
allow
mr.
holmquist
there.
the
teachers
were
there
with
board
representatives
and
were
dealing
with
the
matter
where
we?re
trying
to
get
to
an
agreement
on
a
collective
bargaining
contract.
so,
there
was
a
difference
in
the
forms.
what
the
supreme
court
has
said
is
that
in
a
public
regular
meeting,
a
board
of
education
may
only
selectively
listen
to
certain
people
solely
based
on
content,
not
even
based
on
their
reaction
because
they
had
no
reaction,
whatsoever,
during
the
public
appearance
portion
that
mr.
holmquist
talked.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
yes,
i
do.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
yes,
but
not
a
unilateral
discussion
is
the
chairman?
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
that
is
correct.
regulation
in
a
negotiating
setting,
but
what
occurred
here
and
what?s
extremely
important
is
that
an
individual
provided
information
to
a
public
decision,
public
body,
and
simply
by
listening,
he
has
been
found
to
have
negotiated
with
that
individual,
doing
nothing
more.
i
think
since
the
wisconsin...
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
absolutely,
that
was
one
of
the
strange
things
about
the
memorandum
that
a
company,
the
wisconsin
employment
relations
commission
decision
suggested
in
that
once
the
board
found
out
that
mr.
holmquist
was
going
to
talk
on
a
matter
subject
to
collective
bargaining,
it
required
him
to
submit
that
matter
to
them
in
writing.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
receive
information
in
writing
or
if
you
receive
it
face-to-face,
if
you
take
no
other
action,
all
you
are
doing
is
receiving
information
and
listening,
not
engaging
in
a
prohibited
bargaining
conduct.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
no,
that
is
one
of
the
strange
things.
they
do
not
prevent
us
from
receiving
it.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
i
do
not
see
how
they
could
practically
do
it,
sir.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
well,
this
is
not
really
a
labor
union
dispute.
i
think
that
mr.
holmquist
could
have
printed
exactly
what
he
said
in
the
newspaper
and
for
the
board
to
have
read
that.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
no,
we
are
discussing
his
right
and
our
ability
to
raise
that
right.
mr.
holmquist?s
right
of
free
speeches...
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
yes
i
am,
and
the
rights
of
the
employee
are
completely
intertwined
with
the
obligations
of
the
employer
at
the
public
meeting
because
it
is
a
public
party.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
perhaps,
i
didn?t
understand
your
question,
justice
marshall.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
a
public
employer,
as
a
public
body,
would
be
always
interested
in
anything
that
would
have
any
information
that
would
help
him
develop
his
position
as
a
public
body
in
negotiations
with
the
exclusive
representative
of
its
employees.
here,
he
merely
received
information
and
that
is
all.
private
sector
labor
relations,
in
the
case,
that
an
employer
may
receive
information
from
its
employees
without
violating
the
labor
relations
acts.
in
fact,
the
statutes
of
wisconsin
and
the
united
states
regarding
labor
relations
specifically
allow
employees
to
present
grievances
to
their
employer
and
preserve
that
right.
that
kind
of
communication
preserved
by
statute
certainly
cannot
be
forbidden
from
a
public
employer
to
receive
at
a
public
meeting
during
a
portion
of
meeting
devoted
to
public
hearing.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
well,
the
state
law,
has
interpreted
and
apply,
once
they
follow
the
first
amendment
of
this
constitution,
and
i
think
of
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
yes,
that
is
one
of
the
arguments
we
put
forward,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
he
was
not
named
as
a
respondent.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
absolutely.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
no,
i
don?t.
i
believe
that
this
case
is
probably
better
in
line
with
this
court?s
decision
in
mosley
and
grannett(ph)
and.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
yes.
because
it
was
my
feeling
that
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
decision
in
this
case
was
wrapped
up
in
speech,
in
the
speech
of
an
employee
at
a
public
hearing
of
a
pubic
body.
i
felt
it
would
be
essential
to
tell
us
or
read
to
the
court
exactly
what
the
employee
said.
it
only
took
about
two-and-a-half
minute.
i
do
not
think
it
is
important
now,
but
a
review
of
those
remarks
i
submit,
indicates
that
mr.
holmquist
when
he
spoke
to
the
board
was
speaking
as
a
citizen
and
in
a
citizenship
capacity
as
opposed
to
an
employee?s
capacity.
he
was
providing
information
to
both
parties
regarding
the
negotiation
process
suggesting
that
there
was
an
impasse
that
had
occurred
and
a
way
to
provide
a
catalyst
to
get
over
that
particular
impasse.
the
peculiar
and
obnoxious
part
of
the
definition
that
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
applies
to
negotiation
is
the
premise
that
you
negotiate
with
somebody
when
you
listen
to
somebody.
this
definition
we
submit
in
our
brief
has
been
rejected
as
a
proper
definition
in
private
sector
labor
relations,
and
we
have
cited
a
number
of
cases
where
the
private
employers
have
indeed
listened
or
received
petitions
from
their
employees.
it
is
also
contrary
to
the
statutory
rights
in
both
wisconsin
and
the
federal
labor
statutes,
which
preserve
the
right
of
employers
to
present
grievances.
finally,
the
cases
cited
by
the
appellee,
meadow
and
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
meadow
and
emporium,
these
cases
suggest
that
the
character
of
the
underlying
conduct
in
order
to
find
negotiation
is
more
than
merely
listening.
the
definition,
as
i
suggested
of
negotiation,
as
meaning
merely
listening
is
particularly
obnoxious
in
the
public
sector
because
what
it
does
is,
it
forecloses
in
this
case
a
public
hearing
to
a
particular
individual
simply
on
the
basis
of
the
content
of
the
speech
he
wishes
to
make,
nothing
more,
just
the
speech.
this
undercuts
the
core
value
of
the
first
amendment
to
free
interchange,
unfettered
interchange
of
ideas,
ideas
only.
if
indeed,
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
was
to
appropriately
define
negotiation,
we
wouldn?t
run
into
this
constitutional
collision
that
we
have
in
this
case.
i
think
this
court
has
been
emphatic
in
relationship
to
the
kinds
of
rights
that
individuals
have
in
public
forum.
this
was
a
classic
public
forum,
a
school
board
meeting,
an
open
public
hearing
at
a
school
board
meeting.
in
this
classic
public
forum,
certainly,
speech
should
not
be
selectively
on
a
basis
of
content
and
the
status,
supposed
status
of
an
individual
be
abridged.
we
submit
that,
in
conclusion,
that
the
definition
of
negotiation
adopted
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
must
be
rejected
as
inherently
unconstitutional,
since
it
does
indeed
undercut
our
commitment
to
free
and
open
debate
on
public
questions,
since
it
rejects
this
court?s
holding
that
teachers
have
certain
constitutional
rights
and
public
employers
must
be
responsive
to
these
rights.
finally,
because
it
prohibits
expression
in
a
public
forum
in
the
absence
of
a
substantive
much
less
a
weighty
reason
as
required
in
public
forum
matters.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
yes,
your
honor,
and
as
much
as,
as
public
officials,
they
are
charged
and
have
obligated
themselves
taking
an
oath,
both
to
respect
and
obligate
themselves
to
implementing
the
rights
of
the
first
amendment.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
mr.
chief
justice,
i
just
have
about
three
points.
one,
i
believe
mr.
justice
marshall
is
correct.
the
totality
of
the
conduct
is
not
before
this
court.
what
is
before
this
court
is
the
wisconsin
supreme
court?s
definition
of
?negotiation?.
that
definition
of
negotiation
creates
an
unconstitutional
intrusion
in
our
view
for
the
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
kelly,
and
in
that
sense,
a
mere
remand
of
the
order
without
instructions
that
such
a
definition
creates
that
constitutional
intrusion
would
be
unfortunate
in
the
appellant?s
view.
mr.
kelly
apparently
has
retreated
from
the
position
of
the
order
ought
to
be
affirmed.
let
me
suggest
that
the
totality
of
the
bargaining
conduct,
the
totality
of
the
conduct
that
mr.
kelly
suggest
is
bargaining,
cannot
be
sustained.
what
occurred
was
a
circulation
of
a
petition
in
non-working
areas,
on
non-working
times
in
the
school;
this
was
found
by
just
stayed
in
the
opinion.
we
take
a
look
at
your
decision
in
the
nlrb
v.
magnavox.
this
court
has
recognized
that
communication
between
employees
at
the
workplace,
in
non-working
areas
and
non-working
times,
is
something
that
is
permissible
under
federal
labor
statutes.
that
communication
is
important
in
order
to
prevent
entrenchment
of
the
majority
representative.
so,
that
aspect
of
the
totality
of
the
conduct
is
inappropriate
for
consideration
here.
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
that
is
correct
but
to
suggest
that
to
allow
it
was
before
the
court
or
that
issue
was
before
the
court
is
not
correct.
the
only
issue
before
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
was
the
issue
of
negotiation.
the
other
way
supposedly
that
the
board
aided
and
abetted
mr.
holmquist
was
to
allow
the
use
of
mailboxes.
i
suggest..
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
yes
and
i
think
we...
mr.
gerald
c.
kops
yes,
we
are
arguing
that
and
i
didn?t
get
a
chance
to
devote
any
time
in
the
oral
argument
but
i
believe
we
adequately
cover
it
also
in
our
brief,
we
are
attempted.
one
final
word,
mr.
kelly
and
myself
have
been
accorded
by
this
court
an
opportunity
for
now
almost
an
hour
to
engage
in
colloquy
and
question
and
answers
and
i
don?t
believe
there
is
any
member
of
this
court
or
in
the
courtroom,
who
would
believe
that
what
mr.
kelly
and
i
were
doing
was
negotiating
with
this
court
with
regard
to
the
order
or
its
decision.
that
is
essentially
what
mr.
holmquist
did,
he
talked
to
the
board
of
education
and
nothing
more.
thank
you.
