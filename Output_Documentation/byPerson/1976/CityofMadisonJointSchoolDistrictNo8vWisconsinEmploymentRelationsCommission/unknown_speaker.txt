unknown
speaker
in
that
connection
then
mr.
kops,
the
board
here
is
not
asserting
any
claim
of
its
own.
is
it
simply
asserting
the
rights
of
mr.
holmquist?
unknown
speaker
if
any
of
our
cases
ever
sustained
any
constitutional
claim
that
was
asserted
by
a
political
sub-division
of
a
state
against
the
state.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
constitution
and
this
problem
arises
from
the
plaintiff?s
side.
unknown
speaker
therefore
rather
you
were
saying...
unknown
speaker
of
the
school
board?
you?re
a
representing
school
board.
unknown
speaker
the
school
board
is
prerogative
here,
on
what
federal
right
does
the
school
board
assert?
unknown
speaker
in
which
amendment
is
this
you're
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
first
amendment,
you
have
a
right
to
listen.
unknown
speaker
you
have
right
to
hear.
unknown
speaker
who
made
the
public
forum,
the
state
of
wisconsin?
unknown
speaker
would
you
question
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
to
its
legislature
could
have
said
to
every
board
of
education
in
the
state,
you
will
have
no
public
hearing
section
of
your
meeting?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
members
of
the
board
wanted
to
open
up
but
the
state
legislature
has
said,
?you
will
not
have
this
particular
type
of
agenda
on
your
meeting.?
unknown
speaker
but
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
has
in
effect
construed
the
wisconsin
labor
relations
statute
to
that
affect
in
this
case,
haven?t
they?
unknown
speaker
i
am
assuming
that
the
highest
court
of
wisconsin
has
indeed
construed
the
law
in
that
way,
they
cannot
construe
their
own
state
law
in
conflict
with
the
federal
constitution.
unknown
speaker
the
board
is
subject
to
the
limitations
of
the
first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
they
are
bound
to?
unknown
speaker
has
your
opposition
raised
the
question
of
standing
here?
unknown
speaker
is
it
argued
here
now,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kops,
could
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
suppose
the
board
had
refused
permission
to
mr.
holmquist
to
address
it.
would
it
have
been
subject
to
1983
claim?
unknown
speaker
you
don?t
think
that
moore
v.
(inaudible)
county
would
cut
across
and
against
the...
unknown
speaker
suppose,
there?s
no
question
what
the
board
can
regulate
the
time,
manner
and
place
of
presentation
of
these
things,
and
if
the
board
can
do
it,
there
is
no
question
would
the
state
legislature
can
tell
the
board
that
it
has
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
so
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
blackmun?s
question
is
that
on
these
particular
facts
the
board
might
have
been
subject
to
a
1983
action
given
the
fact
that
this
agenda
had
then
set
aside
for
public
description.
unknown
speaker
monthly
meeting?
unknown
speaker
twice
monthly.
unknown
speaker
but
would
you
think
the
board
will
be
subject
to
a
1983
to
a
claim
of
constitutional
deprivation,
if
it
said
we?re
simply
not
going
to
have
this
as
a
part
of
a
meeting
in
the
future?
unknown
speaker
well,
yeah,
the
school
board
has
two
meetings,
one
is
public,
one
is
private?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
this
case,
they
had
a
public
meeting
and
they
heard
both
sides
on
this
question
involving
employment
conditions.
unknown
speaker
they
may
hold
the
private
meeting
in
which
everybody
was
barred.
unknown
speaker
i
said
everybody
was
barred.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
that
they
left,
they
went
into
executive
session
the
same
night,
laid
down
the
ground
rules
where
they
barred
from
that
meeting,
did
not
they?
unknown
speaker
so
they?re
going
to
bar
and
permit
other
one.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
to
say
that
the
open
meeting
was
the
negotiating
meeting?
unknown
speaker
why
did
they
hear
from
both
sides?
unknown
speaker
was
this
meeting
called
in
part
for
negotiation?
unknown
speaker
what
did
happened
that
the
president
of
union
was
there?
unknown
speaker
so
they
made
the
negotiation
of
bargaining.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
interested
in
bargaining?
you
just
said
there
was
a
bargaining
atmosphere,
weren?t
that
your
words.
unknown
speaker
then
bargaining
what?
unknown
speaker
was
it
barred
at
the
meeting
and
any
other
public
meeting
was
the
contract
discussed?
unknown
speaker
the
interesting
thing
to
me
is
that
you
say
this
is
not
negotiating,
but
you
admit
that
right
immediately
after
the
public
meeting,
there
was
an
executive
meeting,
followed
the
next
day
by
a
negotiating
meeting.
unknown
speaker
the
public
meeting
had
no
connection
with
it
at
all.
unknown
speaker
the
counsel,
don?t
you
concede
that
if
the
talk
constitutes
bargaining
or
negotiation
that
it
may
be
prohibited?
unknown
speaker
and
wouldn?t
that
be
a
prohibition
based
on
the
content
and
what
you
said?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
were,
you
would
then
agree
that
some
regulation
of
speech
based
on
its
content
is
permissible?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kops,
could
mr.
holmquist
have
done
the
same
thing
by
letter
to
the
board?
unknown
speaker
but
it?s
been
denied
by
the
state
listening?
unknown
speaker
if
i
understand
the
dissenting
opinion
under
wisconsin
supreme
court
correctly,
it
may
entrust
as
that
the
action
of
the
majority
and
the
action
of
the
law
of
wisconsin
denies
the
right
of
the
school
board
to
hear
all
points
of
view
if
that
is
the
thrust
of
the
first
amendment
plan.
unknown
speaker
but
you?re
also
relying
on
your
ability
to
assert
the
third
party
claim
of
mr.
holmquist
as
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
he
was
not
named
as
a
respondent
in
the
employment
commission
proceedings.
unknown
speaker
so,
if
anybody
was
to
raise
his
right
in
this
proceeding
i
take
would
have
to
be
your
client.
unknown
speaker
so
far
as
this
question
goes,
your
case
is
quite
like
kleindienst
v.
mandel,
you
remember
that
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
that?s
so
far
as
the
substantive
constitutional
issue.
unknown
speaker
that
we
should
hold
mr.
kops
that
you
have
not
standing,
the
board
has
no
standing
to
assert
the
rights
of
holmquist.
it
would
then
fall
back
to
you
on
the
first
amendment
right
of
the
members
of
the
school
board
herein
anyone,
they
want
to
hear?
unknown
speaker
suppose
holmquist
had
not
been
a
teacher,
just
another
taxpayer,
steamfitter
or
a
carpenter
or
whatever
and
he
had
walked
into
the
meeting
having
heard
that
there
was
a
meeting,
and
said
all
of
the
same
things
that
holmquist
said.
do
you
think
the
state
of
wisconsin
can
forbid
the
board
of
education
to
hear
him?
unknown
speaker
would
there
be
a
constitutional
difference
between
minority
of
1972
and
the
minority
of
1971,
is
that
your
point?
unknown
speaker
well
just
so
you
understand,
it
is
critical
to
your
position
that
he
was
speaking
for
persons
other
than
himself.
you
would
concede
that
if
he
was
speaking
just
for
himself
that
he
had
a
constitutional
right
to
do
what
he
did.
unknown
speaker
you
also
agree
that
the
board
is
a
proper
party
to
raise
holmquist?s
constitutional
right?
unknown
speaker
sure,
because
session
we
have
to
even
if
you
win,
we
have
to
limit
the
order,
don?t
we?
unknown
speaker
that
order,
to
me,
is
unbelievable.
unknown
speaker
i
have
a
great
difficulty
in
finding
negotiation
and
on
one
side
of
statement
of
two-and-a-half
minutes.
unknown
speaker
do
you
see
the
problem?
unknown
speaker
they
bring
me
to
the
point
that
what
in
his
two-and-a-half
minutes
different
from
what
he
had
been
saying
all
along?
unknown
speaker
my
point
is,
hadn?t
the
board
been
told
that
was
his
position?
didn?t
they
read
this
material?
unknown
speaker
i
can
say,
i
have
cover
all
of
this
time
he
said
he
wanted
to
circulate
it
now?
unknown
speaker
well
you
couldn?t
stop
that,
could
you?
unknown
speaker
all
you
want
to
do
is
stop
this
two-and-a-half
minute
talk.
unknown
speaker
that
was
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
you
may
relief
on
that
and
you
didn?t
appeal.
unknown
speaker
i
still
have
example
with
this
two-and-a-half
minute
being
negotiating.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
say
the
school
board
can?t
listen
to
him?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
stranger
has
made
the
same
remarks
that
holmquist
did
it,
see
on
madison
taxpayer,
so
i
just
do
not
believe
in
this
fair
share
proposition.
now,
you
concede
the
board
could
have
changed
its
posture
and
reliance
on
that
service.
unknown
speaker
justice
rehnquist
says
could
this
taxpayer
as
i
tried
to
get
you
discussed
before,
just
any
other
person
come
in
and
say
these
things
and
could
any
law
of
wisconsin
stop
that
utterances,
stop
the
right
of
the
board
to
listen
to
it?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
board
complaining
about?
are
they
not
complaining
that
they
have
been
forbidden
to
hear?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kelly,
doesn?t
that
paragraph
one
of
the
order
prohibit
more
than
negotiation?
the
order
of
the
commission
does
sir
and
that
is
unfortunate
in
our
complaint
we
requested.
unknown
speaker
do
you
concede
it?s
too
broad
to
be
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
but,
in
your
brief,
you?ve
asked
that
the
judgment
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
be
affirmed?
you?re
retracting
from
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
your
position
now
mean
that
terms
such
as
?bargaining
clause?
and
?negotiation
clause?
become
issues
of
federal
constitutional
law
that
this
court
must
find
that
either
there
was
or
was
not
bargaining?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
kelly,
may
be
i
don?t
correctly
understand
what
your
supreme
court
held,
what
as
i
read,
the
opinion
of
the
majority.
the
majority
found
that
there
was
indeed
an
invasion
of
first
amendment
rights
here.
they
found
it
was
but
they
said
that
this
order
was
justified
--
perhaps
it
is
over
broad
issue
now
you
can
see,
on
the
ground
that
under
the
?clear
and
present
danger
test?,
there
was
involved
a
state
interest
namely
that
bargaining
should
be
limited
to
the
majority
representative,
and
that
to
that
extent
this
order
was
justified
to
prevent
that
invasion
of
a
state
interest.
unknown
speaker
was
that
it?
unknown
speaker
finally
?clear
and
present
danger
test.?
unknown
speaker
in
ordinary
taxpayer
and
walked
in
there
and
said
i
don?t
like,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
suggesting
to
you,
i
don?t
like
these
kinds
of
contracts
and
i
am
speaking
for
myself
and
142
or
232
other
citizens
who
signed
this
petition
and
we?re
just
telling
you,
the
board,
you
shouldn?t
make
this
kind
of
a
contract.
do
you
regard
that
as
negotiating?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
wisconsin
legislature,
instead
of
passing
a
little
nlrb
in
effect
for
public
workers,
have
passed
a
law
saying
that
we
think
stability
in
labor
relations
in
public
sector
will
best
be
produced
by
having
absolutely
no
unions
and
no
school
board
is
free
to
even
discuss
the
matter
of
a
union
with
any
of
its
employees
and
mr.
holmquist
or
his
counterpart
had
gotten
up
at
a
meeting
like
this
and
said,
i
think
we
ought
to
have
a
union
in
this
school
and
then
the
action
was
taken
against
him
for
making
this
sort
of
a
speech.
do
you
think
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
would
be
upheld
here
if
it
said
that
through
there
was
an
infringement
on
his
first
amendment
right,
but
the
public
policy
of
the
state
is
that
there
aren?t
going
to
be
any
unions.
his
speech
had
a
tendency
to
--
it
was
an
imminent
danger
of
producing
a
countervalence
of
that
policy
and
therefore
will
sanction
his
punishment.
unknown
speaker
actually,
the
issue
before
us
is
whether
this
was
a
proper
case
for
the
application
of
the
?clear
and
present
danger
test?.
unknown
speaker
that?s
already.
unknown
speaker
was
not
that
the
issue
that
would
be
presented
by
the
hypothetical,
my
brother
rehnquist
has
just
posed
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
had
intended
the
way
mr.
justice
brennan
understood
it.
supposing
the
?clear
and
present
danger?
to
stability
of
labor
relation
and
mr.
holmquist?s
remarks
arose
not
from
the
fact
that
he
was
negating
the
idea
of
only
majority
representative
bargaining,
but
that
was
coming
as
a
different
point
of
view.
he
was
urging
unions
where
the
state
has
said
there
will
be
no
unions.
do
you
think
that
kind
of
a
decision
suppressing
him
for
that
reason
could
be
upheld?
in
the
balance,
i
don?t
think
that
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
?clear
and
present
danger
test?.
in
other
words,
what
i
am
saying
is
sir
that
exclusivity
has
recognized
the
right
in
the
majority
and
the
reason
that
it?s
permitted
an
invasion
of
free
speech
at
all
is
to
prevent
the
dangers
of
relevant
chaos
in
labor
relations
and
it?s
my
feeling
and
it?s
our
position
that
when
there
is
a
majority
union
present
--
and
in
this
kind
of
circumstances,
a
minority
union
or
a
minority
group
is
allowed
to
organize
and
to
work
against
its
position
and
to
undermine
its
position
that
would
lead
to
chaos
in
the
labor
relations
sectors.
unknown
speaker
suppose
that
mr.
holmquist
rather
than
appearing
before
the
board
had
published
an
advertisement
in
the
morning
paper,
the
same
day
of
the
board
meeting.
the
advertisement
being
specifically
addressed
to
the
board
and
consisting
precisely
what
was
said
in
the
two-and-a-half
minute
statement
to
the
board?
could
your
commission
have
moved
against
mr.
holmquist
or
it
have
a
joined
phil
advertising
or
would
this
be
analogous
to
the
state
before
the
board
itself?
unknown
speaker
no
sir,
what?
unknown
speaker
otherwise,
he
could
advertise
all
they
wanted.
unknown
speaker
even
on
behalf
of
a
group
or
minorities.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kelly,
i
have
some
difficulty
understanding
what
you?re
saying
when
we
talked
about
?clear
and
present
danger?.
speech
may
be
prohibited
if
there?s
a
?clear
and
present
danger?
of
what
and
is
it
the
?clear
and
present
danger?
that
the
board
might
not
accept
the
union?s
demand
or
the
?clear
and
present
danger?
that
the
union
may
no
longer
be
in
a
position
to
speak
for
the
majority.
unknown
speaker
well,
which
is
it
here
and
i
don?t
see
a
lot
of
examples.
what
is
your
position
here?
unknown
speaker
of
chaos
in
labor
relations
in
madison
wisconsin
because
in
the
collective
bargaining
process,
the
majority
union
was
not
going
to
obtain
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
unknown
speaker
by
chaos,
you
mean
that
the
board
will
not
accept
the
union?s
demands.
so
any
time
that
speech
might
persuade
the
board
to
not
to
accept
a
demand
that,
that
could
be
prohibited?
unknown
speaker
what
difference
will
make
the
dissident
union
if
any
individual
creates
a
?clear
and
present
danger?
of
the
evil
that
you
describe
like
anti-speech
be
prohibited.
unknown
speaker
by
clout,
now,
you
simply
mean
that
they
may
persuade
the
board
not
to
go
along
with
the
majority?s
request?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
you?re
saying
that
any
argument
can
be
prohibited
if
it
has
to
be
successful?
unknown
speaker
that
one
man
you
see
these
people,
you
only
have
conduct
with
one
man.
unknown
speaker
he
said
he
was.
no
proof
in
his
record
that
he
represented
anybody.
unknown
speaker
that
is
just
too
many.
unknown
speaker
but
as
a
matter
of
law,
he
could
not
speak
for
these
people
if
there
was
another
(inaudible)
representative,
isn?t
that
perfectly
clear?
he
could
not
bind
anyone
in
the
union.
unknown
speaker
but
he
can
do
anything
except
speaking
at
the
board
meeting.
unknown
speaker
it
was
sanctioned
around
and
against
the
employer
though
did
not
it,
not
against
him
and
there
is
always
hypothetical
question
about
what
could
you
do
to
mr.
holmquist...
unknown
speaker
if
you
want
to
redraw
the
board?s
role,
how
would
you
redraw
it?
unknown
speaker
i
have
great
difficulty
in
finding
that
they
negotiate
it.
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
i
am
not
saying
--
i
have
learned
long
ago,
not
to
say
it
never
happened.
well,
i
have
never
heard
of
a
negotiating
session
of
two-and-a-half
minutes.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
how
to
do.
unknown
speaker
well,
that?s
what
you
call
negotiating?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
say
the
school
board
can
negotiate
every
place
except
the
public
meeting.
that
is
i
get
all
confused.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
can
read
the
newspaper.
unknown
speaker
what
is
negotiating,
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
say.
i
got
two-and-a-half
minutes.
now
what
are
they
negotiating
that
the
school
board
do
with
this
man,
the
school
board
do
with
this
man.
unknown
speaker
that
could
have
been
stopped.
but
did
anybody
ask,
would
that
be
stopped?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
anybody
take
any
proceeding
in
anybody
did
not?
unknown
speaker
the
only
proceeding
was
to
stop
him
for
making
his
two-and-a-half
minute
speech
and
that
i
submit
is
all
that
is
before
us.
do
you
agree?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
fact
that?s
permissible
under
federal
labor
statutes
doesn?t
mean
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
to
allow
it
under
state
labor
statutes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kops,
may
i
ask
you
another
question
even
if
you
are
wrong
about
whether
this
was
bargaining
or
not
and
another
way
you
can
conclude
it
by
that
holding
of
your
supreme
court,
does
this
constitute
bargaining?
doesn?t
there?s
dual
question
here
whether
the
first
amendment
would
permit
that
kind
of
prohibition
at
a
public
meeting?
unknown
speaker
are
you
arguing
that
too?
