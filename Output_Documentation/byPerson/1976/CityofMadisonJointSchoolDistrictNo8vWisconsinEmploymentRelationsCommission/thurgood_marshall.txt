justice

does
the
labor
board
of
wisconsin
prevent
you
from
reading
it,
from
reading,
from
a
minority
group
of
the
union?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
say
do
not,
i
say
could
not,
couldn?t
they.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
see
how
the
state
could
stop
you
from
listening
the
two
sides
in
the
labor
union
dispute
when
you
have
one
union
recognized?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
you
said
we
were
not
discussing
his
right;
we
were
discussing
your
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
never
understood
how
an
employer
can
raise
the
right
of
an
employee.
you
are
talking
about
employee
and
employer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
should
think
that
the
rights
of
a
minority
union
would
be
possibly
be
tied
in
with
the
employer,
but
not
the
union
itself.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
am
worried
about
an
employer
being
interested
in
where
the
minority
position
is
in
a
negotiation
with
a
union.
