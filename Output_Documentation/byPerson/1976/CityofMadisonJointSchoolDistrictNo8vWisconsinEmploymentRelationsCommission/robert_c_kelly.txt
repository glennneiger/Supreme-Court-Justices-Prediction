mr.
robert
c.
kelly
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
concept
of
exclusivity
in
the
public
sector
of
our
economy.
that
concept
plies
at
the
core
of
labor
relations
in
the
private
sector
of
the
economy
and
that
concept
simply
stated
is
the
right
of
the
majority
of
the
employees
in
appropriate
bargaining
unit
to
select
an
exclusive
representative
to
deal
with
their
employer
as
concerns
matters
of
wages
and
hours
and
working
conditions,
not
only
for
the
majority,
but
for
the
entire
collective
bargaining
unit.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
no
sir,
i
don?t.
let
me
say
that
was
not
the
circumstance
here.
by
a
long
shot,
mr.
holmquist
appeared
and
announced
in
specific
words
when
he
did
appear
that
he
did
not
appear
as
a
citizen,
indeed,
that
he
did
not
appear
as
a
private
employee
or
an
employee
of
the
board,
but
that
he
employed
as
a
representative
of
an
informal
committee
of
72
teachers
in
49
schools.
in
group
of
teacher,
sir,
he
had
organized
into
an
informal
minority
called
ecology.
he
appeared
as
the
representative
and
agent
of
a
dissident
minority
union.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
yes
sir.
well,
if
he
as
the
dissident
employee
speaking
as
a
dissident
employee
or
a
citizen,
sir,
i
assume
this
case
would
not
be
here.
the
fact
is
that
if
we
approach
this
from
the
totality
of
mr.
holmquist
conduct,
he,
for
one
month
ahead
of
this
particular
school
boarding,
the
school
board
meeting
organized
a
minority?
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
they
major
that
sir,
we
raised
the
question
of
the
board
standing
in
their
application
to
this
court
for
jurisdiction
and
when
this
court
took
jurisdiction;
frankly,
we
didn?t
proceed
with
that
any
further.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
yes
sir.
let
me
again
speak
to
that.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
that
is
right,
sir.
let
me
say
that
our
complaint
before
the
wisconsin
employment
relations
commission
appears
in
the
record,
and
the
relief
we
sought
in
that
complaint
was
as
follows,
?that
an
order
to
issue
requiring
a
respondent?s
decision
desist
from
negotiating
now
and
in
the
future,
request
concerns
questions
of
wages,
hours
and
conditions
of
employment
with
individual
employees
or
groups
of
employees.
it
is
our
contention,
sir,
if
this
court
finds
that
holmquist
and
the
board
were
negotiating
in
a
prohibited
sense
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
for
a
proper
order
based
on
negotiating.?
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
i
assert.
let
me
say
what
happened
here.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
yes
sir.
what
happened
here
was
the
legislature
of
wisconsin
saw
fit
in
november,
sir,
to
permit
a
fair
share
amendment
or
a
fair
share
proposal
in
collective
bargaining
agreement.
so
at
that
time
madison
teachers
submitted
its
third
proposal
at
collective
bargaining
and
it
have
been
11
long
months
of
collective
bargaining,
sir.
at
that
same
time
was
the
time
when
mr.
holmquist
organized
his
campaign
to
despoil
or
mar
the
collective
bargaining
position
of
the
majority
that
was
to
incorporate
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
he
prepared
some
letters
and
circulated
those
letters
to
all
of
the
teachers
in
madison
public
schools.
he
prepared
anti-fair
share
and
anti-union
literature.
he
requested
from
the
school
district
the
permission
to
circulate
that
material
to
the
bargain
union
teachers
through
the
school
mail,
even
though
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
then
in
existence
between
the
board
and
the
schools
prohibited
that.
he
asked
for
and
received
permission
to
circulate
his
anti-fair
share
material
in
the
schools
without
regard
to
working
or
non-working
areas.
he
furnished
the
administration
or
the
principals
of
those
buildings
copies
of
his
material.
they
were
aware
of
the
material
that
he
had.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
officers
of
the
union
spoke
to
the
assistant
superintendent
of
schools
and
asked
that
they
not
cooperate
in
the
fair
share
amendment.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
well,
his
position
was
that
he
wanted
fair
share
deferred
for
another
year
and
that
is
what
he
asked
the
board
to
do
and
that
is
what
they
did,
sir.
they
went
from
immediately
from?
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
no,
he
stated
it
to
them,
sir.
in
a
very
charged
atmosphere?
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
well,
he
circulated.
i
do
not
know
were
they
read,
who
read
or
what
i
know
that
it
was
given
to
principals,
sir.
for
a
month,
during
this
month
period
going
up,
i
know
that?
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
no.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
well,
we
asked
that
he
not
be
permitted
to
use
the
school
mails,
which
would
had
been
done
explicitly
to
the
majority
union.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
no,
we
didn?t
ask
for
it.
that
was
part
of
the
totality
of
conduct
that
the
board
looked
at.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
well,
i
think
sir
that
listening
negotiations
is
i
suppose
synonymous?
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
well,
not
to
the
extent
that
they
allow
themselves
to
be
influenced
to
change
their
bargaining
position,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
yes,
sir
and
i
doubt
they
would,
sir.
i
doubt
--
what
happened
here
was
we
had
a?
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
no,
sir.
they
could
not.
if
the
board
heard
that
at
a
public
meeting
and
they?re
interested
in
that,
they
can
hear.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
no.
we
take
the
position
sir
that
they
did
more
than
hear
that
they
negotiated.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
yes
sir,
i
do
and
that
is
why
we
ask
that
and
i
am
asking
now
that
if
this
court
finds
that
there
was
indeed
negotiating
and
that
holmquist?s
conduct
therefore
it
was
negotiating
and
it
was
not
entitled
to
the
full
first
amendment
protection
that
the
remedy
be
to
remand
the
case
with
the
instructions
to
enter
an
order
to
assist
in,
for
example,
with
what
we
asked
for
in
our
complaint
that
the
board
not
negotiate
with
the
minority,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
yes
sir.
to
that
extent
if
the
court
would
find
that
there
was
indeed
bargaining
then
that
be
the
remedy,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
yes
sir,
it
is
my
understanding
of
the
exclusivity
doctrine
limits
speech
in
the
least
in
the
negotiating
and
bargaining
areas,
i
understand
it,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
that
is
right
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
yes
sir,
the
dennis
v.
united
states
test.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
no
sir.
i
do
regard
this
negotiating
sir
when
a
minority
is
organized
just
as
any
minority
union
would
be,
but
the
purpose
of
upsetting
or
disturbing
the
majority?s
position,
which
they
successfully
did
here,
as
i
have
said
or
would
say.
what
happened
here
was
that
mr.
holmquist
asked.
let
me
say
this
that
after
11
months
of
negotiating
here,
sir,
there
were
13
issues
left
unresolved,
there
were
just
11
hard
months
of
negotiating.
one
of
the
issues
was
a
major
issue
was
fair
share
and
the
second
major
issue
was
the
binding
arbitration
of
teacher
dismissals
and
non-renewals.
they
were
both
key
issues
and
the
board
had
been
firm
on
both
of
those
for
11
months.
the
board,
at
one
time,
had
unofficially
indicated
that
they
would
consider
granting
?fair
share?
but
that
they
would
in
no
way
grant
binding
arbitration.
mr.
holmquist
specifically
asked
in
his
remarks
that
the
?fair
share?
be
deferred
for
a
year.
immediately
after
hearing
him
in
public
session
and
asking
to
receive
his
petitions,
the
board
went
into
executive
session
and
in
that
executive
session,
they
discussed
ongoing
negotiations
with
the
madison
teachers
that
which
have
been
going
on
for
11
months
and
during
that
discussion,
they
passed
a
resolution
and
that
resolution
was
that
we
will
now
grant,
for
the
first
time,
binding
arbitration
but
we
will
not
grant
?fair
share?.
it?s
our
position
that
listening
in
that
extent,
allowing
themselves
to
be
influenced
by
the
minority
those
people
interested
in
wages,
hours
and
conditions
in
that
school
district
was
indeed
bargaining.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
no
sir.
i
guess
what
i
see
in
this
case
and
have
seen
sir
is?
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
that?s
right,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
that
is
right
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
not
as
i
understood
him
but
it
may
be
i
did
not
understand.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
no
sir,
there
again,
i
think
it
is
in
the
balance.
the
fact
is
that...
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
no
sir,
they
could
not
move
against
mr.
holmquist.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
that
is
one,
sir.
the
other
thing
i
can
see,
for
instance...
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
the
(inaudible)
speech
has
justified
because
there
was
a
?clear
and
present
danger?
of
something.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
well,
sir,
i
think,
not
from
the
citizenry
but
probably
from
a
dissident
union
group,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
well,
i
expect
sir
that
in
a
practical
sense,
it?s
the
minority
union
that
creates
a
?clear
and
present
danger?
rather
than
some
individual
citizen.
it?s
the
minority
union
working
within
the
majority
that
has
the
clout
to
do
that,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
whatever
that
clause
is
by
undermining
the
relationship
that
that
minority
has
with
the
majority
and
the
inability
to
have
peaceful
labor
relations
in
that
community,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
no
sir,
i
am
not.
yes,
i
am
saying
that
i
feel
that
the
conduct
of
these
folks
in
their
totality
was
bargaining,
but
that
collective
bargaining
is
restricted
to
the
majority
representative.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
well,
he
isn?t
a
representative
of?
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
well,
he
proposed
to
file
a
petition
and
now
he
had
417
signatures
on
that.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
no
sir,
he
couldn?t
bind
them,
but
he
could
spoil
a
union?s
position,
anymore
than
in
the
private
sector
have
an
already
union
working
with
the
employer
can
undermine
and
upset
the
union?s
collective
bargaining
position.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
no
sir,
i
think
he
can
do
anything
but
collectively
bargain
in
the
labor
relation
sense
for
that
board.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
our
position
was
sir
that
the
board
in
listening
to
him
and
pitting
and
beating
was
collective
bargaining
with
the
minority,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
pretty
much
in
the
terms
that
we
originally
asked
for
that
the
board
cease
negotiating
with
the
minority
union,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
no
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
negotiating.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
no
sir,
i
am
calling
the
totality
of
the
conduct,
negotiating.
i
think
negotiating
is
a
very
sophisticated
and
very
subtle
process
that
is
influenced
by
many
things
-
by
what
people
see,
by
what
they
hear,
as
well
as,
by
what
they
say,
indeed
by
body
language.
i
take
the
position
that
negotiating
can
take
place
not
only
at
the
collective
bargaining
table,
but
that
it
can
take
place
in
the
hall
or
on
the
street,
wherever
people
see
each
other
and
particularly
in
negotiations,
as
i
know
them,
in
madison
wisconsin
to
take
a
year
to
achieve
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
no
sir,
i
say
they
can
negotiate
with
the
minority
union
at
any
place
or
time.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
well,
i
do
not
think
putting
that
in
newspaper
is
negotiating,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
the
school
board,
through
its
agents,
aided
and
abetted
him
to
pass
his
material
around
to
the
bargaining
unit
teachers
through
the
teacher
mailboxes.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
yes
sir,
they
went
to
spoke
to
the
mr.
matthews.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
no
sir,
they
did
not.
mr.
robert
c.
kelly
no
sir.
i
feel
--
what?s
before
you
is
whether
that?s
conduct
of
the
parties,
the
board
in
its
totality,
was
collective
bargaining.
if
it
was
then
we?re
entitled
to
have
it
limited
to
the
majority
representative.
if
it
was
not
sir
then
it
was
first
amendment
area
and
could
not
be
an
order
prohibiting
him.
