mr.
irving
galt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
an
appeal
by
the
attorney
general
of
new
york.
a
defendant
below
was
also
charged,
of
course,
with
the
responsibility
of
defending
the
constitutionality
of
state
statutes
from
a
judgment
of
a
three-judge
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
the
judgment
below
declared
section
22
of
the
state’s
election
law
unconstitutional
and
joined
its
enforcement
against
the
appellee
as
being
violative
of
the
federal
constitution
under
the
fifth
amendment.
in
relevant
part
and
in
essence,
the
statute
in
dispute
provides
that
the
refusal
of
a
political-party
officer
to
waive
immunity
from
criminal
prosecution,
when
called
before
a
grand
jury
to
testify
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
his
political
office,
thereupon
affects
a
termination
of
tenure
of
the
office
and
also
invokes
a
disqualification,
beginning
then
and
there,
from
holding
for
a
period
of
five
years
thereafter
any
party
or
public
office;
and
parenthetically,
i
might
note
that
the
type
of
immunity
which
is
mandated
by
the
new
york
statutes,
the
new
york
criminal
procedure
law,
when
a
witness
testifies
under
immunity
before
a
grand
jury,
it's
not
simply
use
immunity,
but
full
transactional
immunity.
now,
the
salient
facts
of
the
case
are
few
and,
i
think,
undisputed.
mr.
irving
galt
no.
they're
being
asked
to
waive
immunity
of
any
kind;
they
would
get
transactional
--
mr.
irving
galt
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
you,
justice
white;
but
they
would
get
--
if
they
did
receive
immunity
they
would
get
full
transactional
immunity,
not
merely
use
immunity.
mr.
irving
galt
the
federal
constitution
merely
requires,
of
course
--
mr.
irving
galt
that’s
right.
mr.
irving
galt
well,
i
don’t
know
whether
it’s
spelled
out
in
so
many
words,
mr.
justice
white;
it
was
not
here.
but
of
course,
that
would
be
clear
and,
in
fact,
as
i
think
i
will
have
occasion
to
--
mr.
irving
galt
that’s
right,
waives
all
immunity;
waives
the
immunity
which
he
would
have,
which
would
be
transactional
immunity,
if
he
got
the
immunity.
mr.
irving
galt
now,
of
course,
it’s
relevant
to
let
the
court
know
that
at
the
time
this
action
was
begun
under
42
u.s.c.
§1983,
the
appellee
held,
and
the
action
arose
out
of
his
holding
of,
four
party
offices
defined
and
recognized
as
such
under
new
york
law.
first
of
all,
i
was
going
to
say
he
is;
but
very
recently
this
changed.
he
was
state
chairman
of
the
state
democratic
party
in
new
york
and
a
member
of
its
executive
committee.
he
was
and
is
also
chairman
of
the
bronx
county
democratic
executive
committee
and
a
member
of
that
committee,
also.
and
it
was
only
after
the
briefs
were
filed
in
this
case,
may
i
note,
that
mr.
cunningham
stepped
down
from
one
of
these
offices,
that
of
state
chairman
of
the
state
democratic
party.
but
important
in
this
connection
it
would
be
to
note
that
party
officers,
and
even
high
party
officers
like
mr.
cunningham,
are
not
elected
either
by
the
elector
at
large
or
the
democratic
electorate,
but
by
a
relative
handful
--
in
fact,
the
real
handful
--
of
other
party
officers.
now,
as
state
chairman,
and
this
is
true
of
the
state
committee
itself,
there
are
many
formal
functions
which
new
york
law
attaches
to
those
offices,
connected,
of
course,
principally
with
the
electoral
process.
but
informally
and
aside
from
that,
i
need
hardly
remind
this
court
of
the
great
power,
the
great
influence,
the
tremendous
prestige,
which
the
chairman
of
a
state
political
party
has.
and
in
this
instance,
the
democratic
party
rules
in
the
state
of
new
york
explicitly
denominate
the
chairman
of
the
state
party
as
the
top
leader
of
the
democratic
party
in
new
york.
and
there
are,
i
think
at
ages
three
to
four
of
our
briefs,
we
have
outlined
these
functions;
and
the
same
with
respect
to
his
chairmanship
of
the
bronx
county
democratic
executive
committee,
also
a
very
powerful
office
and
one
which
exerts
considerable
influence
and
one
which
will
make
its
influence
felt,
i
think,
too,
as
a
great
county
organization
in
the
upcoming
nominations
for
the
mayoralty
campaign,
which
will
take
place
in
1977
in
the
city
of
new
york.
but
in
tandem,
the
holding
of
these
two
offices,
these
two
party
offices,
represents
a
great
deal
of
power
on
the
part
of
the
holder
of
the
office,
or
of
these
offices,
and
i
need
hardly
elaborate
on
that.
i
do
wish
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
none
of
these
party
offices
was
mr.
cunningham
salaried
or
is
he
salaried.
there
is
no
monument
of
any
kind,
no
consideration
of
any
kind,
which
he
received
from
any
of
his
party
offices.
and
--
mr.
irving
galt
that’s
not
holding
party
office;
at
least
i'm
quite
sure
it
is
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
your
honor
is
touching
upon
--
and
you
may
be
at
this
point
touching
upon
the
freedom-of-association
argument,
in
that
respect
there
would
be
no
play
for
the
argument,
because
he
would
be
free
to
do
anything
he
wishes
other
than
being
barred
in
the
office
itself
or
from
party
office.
he
can
counsel
as
much
as
he
wants,
advise,
do
anything
he
wishes
with
respect
to
his
fellow
democrats.
the
statute
doesn’t
bar
him
from
that,
and
i'm
sure
he
could
be
elected
a
delegate.
that’s
not
defined
as
a
party
office
in
new
york.
mr.
irving
galt
i'm
quite
sure
it
would
not.
i
would
almost
be
positive
in
that
respect.
now,
i
do
think
it
pertinent
to
mention
before
going
on
that
at
all
times
and
all
of
these
times,
mr.
cunningham
was
and
is
an
attorney
in
active
practice
in
the
city
of
new
york.
now,
when
in
december
1975
a
subpoena
was
first
served
upon
mr.
cunningham
by
the
then
special
prosecutor
in
charge
of
investigating
the
criminal
justice
system
in
new
york,
that
subpoena
was
resisted.
an
action
was
brought
immediately
in
the
state
courts
to
quash
the
subpoena
on
various
grounds,
including
the
fifth
amendment,
first
amendment,
fifth
amendment
and
fourteenth
amendment
grounds
urged
here,
went
all
the
way
through
the
state
courts
to
the
highest
appellate
level
in
the
state,
and
mr.
cunningham
was
unsuccessful.
and
so,
as
it
happened,
he
finally
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
on
april
12th
of
last
year,
at
which
time
presented
with
a
waiver
of
immunity
to
sign
he
refused
to
sign
it
and
did
not
testify.
and
of
course,
the
operation
of
that
statute
would
be
automatic,
and
he
would
have
been
barred
immediately
from
his
party
offices
and
from
holding
the
other
offices
i
have
mentioned
for
five
years;
but
immediately
brought
this
action
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
and
on
the
very
same
afternoon,
april
13th,
before
a
single
district
judge,
we
argued
the
matter
on
the
question
of
a
tro.
a
tro
was
issued.
there
were
greatly
expedited
proceedings
before
the
three-judge
court,
and
in
a
matter
of
almost
days
the
case
had
been
argued
and
the
decision
rendered
below.
and
that
decision,
as
i
have
indicated,
was
to
strike
down
the
statute,
section
22,
as
unconstitutional
on
fifth
amendment
grounds
without
the
court
having
reached,
however,
the
first
amendment
claim
and,
in
so
doing,
the
court
specifically
said
that
section
22
of
the
new
york
election
law
is
similar
in
operation
to
the
statute
struck
down
in
the
aforementioned
cases,
being,
of
course
--
and
i'm
intercalating
this
--
the
garrity
againts
new
jersey
in
385
u.s.
and
continuing
on
through
this
court’s
1973
decision
in
lefkowitz
againts
turley
in
414
u.s.
and
going
back
to
what
they
said,
"the
statute
struck
down
in
the
aforementioned
cases,
in
that
it",
meaning
section
22,
"conditions
tenure
in
office
upon
the
forfeiture
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
as
such,
it
would
appear
to
fail
to
measure
up
to
constitutionally
accepted
standards."
mr.
irving
galt
no,
but
it’s
undisputed.
i
think
there
is
in
the
...
i
think
it’s
indicated
in
the
petition
that
was
brought.
we
filed
no
papers,
mr.
justice
marshall;
there
wasn’t
time.
we
merely
submitted
a
brief
and
argued,
but
i
don’t
think
it
will
be
disputed
that
this
was
what
the
grand
jury
was
investigating.
that’s
never
been
a
bone
of
contention.
the
propriety
of
its
investigation
is
not
in
question.
mr.
irving
galt
well,
of
course,
justice
marshal
--
mr.
irving
galt
he
brought
a
motion
to
quash
that
subpoena
on
the
same
grounds
as
here,
and
including
many
others,
i
know;
but
if
that
were
the
case,
it
would
have
been
raised
and
disposed
of
there.
but
there
is
no
such
question
here.
we
are
raising,
i
think,
a
non-realistic
issue
in
that
regard,
if
i
may
say
so,
justice
marshall,
because
that
is
not
in
dispute
in
this
case.
there
is
no
question
here
--
mr.
irving
galt
no,
no,
it’s
not
in
dispute
that
he
was
brought
before
this
grand
jury
to
inquire
into
the
conduct
of
this
party
office.
there's
absolutely
no
dispute
about
that.
mr.
irving
galt
well,
that
would
be
the
ballgame.
that’s
right.
now,
the
question
presented
is
whether
new
york’s
interest
in
maintaining
the
integrity
of
its
political
process
and
in
preventing
corruption,
or
even
the
appearance
of
corruption,
in
its
political
system
entitles
it,
with
respect
particularly
to
the
appellee,
a
very
prominent,
non-salaried
party
official,
to
yield
his
party
offices
if
he
fails
to
waive
immunity
in
connection
with
a
grand-jury
inquiry
into
the
conduct
of
his
party
office.
and
that
question,
i
submit,
is
a
very
vital
one,
not
only
to
the
state
of
new
york
and
its
citizens,
but
to
this
court
and
be
really
to
the
nation
at
large,
because
we
are
in
...
mr.
irving
galt
very
much
so.
one
would
not
dispute
that.
but
the
very
grave
interests
here
at
play,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think,
cannot
be
overlooked,
and
in
the
course
of
argument,
without
any
denigration
of
mr.
cunningham’s
rights,
i
will
try
to
indicate,
if
possible,
that
the
state
of
new
york
acted
with
perfect
propriety
here;
and
as
we
go
on,
i
think,
your
honor
--
and
i
hope
i
may
have
the
benefit
of
your
consideration
in
this
regard
--
we
will
show
that
the
state
of
new
york
has
a
perfectly
constitutional
statute
in
section
22,
because
as
everyone
knows,
we
have
just
been
through
an
era,
and
we
may
not
have
emerged
from
it
yet,
in
which
the
nation
witnessed
the
spectacle
--
and
that’s
not
an
exaggerated
word,
spectacle
--
of
very
high
party
officers
abandoning
their
office
in
the
midst
of
scandal
and
corruption
and
scenes
of
scandal
and
corruption
that
i
think
have
been
on
parallel.
and
not
only
that,
on
parallel,
too,
has
been
the
growth
of
public
cynicism,
public
distrust,
of
politicians
in
a
political
office
in
political
parties.
in
fact,
it’s
an
everyday
thing,
commonplace.
you
can
speak
to
any
man
in
the
street,
and
he
will
tell
you
that
all
politicians
are
not
to
be
trusted.
now,
new
york
was
quick
to
respond
to
that
situation,
just
as
did
the
federal
government
in
1974,
when
it
enacted
the
federal
campaign
contributions
act,
which
this
court
upheld
in
very
large
part
in
buckley
against
valeo
in
324
u.s.
last
year.
so
new
york
enacted
a
campaign
finance
reform
law
and
contributions
law
with
a
new
state
board
of
election
designed
to
see
to
it
that
the
political
process
would
be
responsive
to
the
needs
and
demands
of
the
citizenry.
it
also
enacted
in
1974,
the
same
year,
a
public
information
law,
and
in
1976
it
enacted
an
open
meetings
law,
which
would
extend
to
every
public
agency
in
the
state,
even
down
to
and
including
the
smallest
buyer
or
special
service
district.
mr.
irving
galt
no,
section
72
was
enacted,
i
think
in
1953
or
somewhere
around
that
time.
and
i
must
say,
justice
stevens,
that
we
must
have
regard
to
the
fact
that
it
was
enacted
by
whom?
the
legislature,
which
of
course
has
representatives
of
political
parties;
its
members
are
representatives
of
political
parties,
and
the
political
parties
knowingly
enacted
this
statute.
and
while
it
predated
these
reform
measurements,
section
22
has
the
same
aim
and
endeavor,
and
that
is
to
maintain
the
confidence
of
the
people
in
the
political
process
and
in
representative
government.
and
i
think
that
it’s
fair
to
say
that
section
22
is
patently
designed
to
avoid
the
spectacle
of
high
officials
and
high
party
officers
refusing
to
account
for
their
activities
in
party
office
under
oath,
and
doing
that
with
impunity,
because
they
feel
that
they
need
not
waive
immunity;
and
they
can
then,
if
they
testify
under
immunity,
no
matter
what
they
testify
to,
no
matter
how
the
acts
may
violate
the
criminal
law
and
then,
of
course,
they
are
forever
immune
from
prosecution
on
the
transaction
unless
testimony
of
an
entirely
different
nature
of
a
new
situation
should
arise.
mr.
irving
galt
perhaps
he
could
be
subpoenaed
--
mr.
irving
galt
yes,
he
could,
i'm
pretty
sure,
be
subpoenaed
before
a
legislative
inquiry;
but
justice
marshall
--
mr.
irving
galt
yes.
mr.
irving
galt
because
the
grand
jury
is
authorized
to
inquire
into
criminal
acts,
number
one;
and
the
grand
jury
is
the
only
body
of
citizens,
of
regular
ordinary
citizens,
before
whom
the
party
officer
can
be
brought.
legislative
committees
are
not
ordinary
citizens.
mr.
irving
galt
well,
i
think
the
special
prosecutor
did
subpoena
him;
but
there
is
no
question
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
irving
galt
that’s
correct.
there
is
another
special
prosecutor
there
now,
and
of
a
different
political
party,
for
that
matter.
mr.
irving
galt
oh,
yes,
because
the
statute
--
mr.
irving
galt
well,
they
could
have
required
him
to
waive
immunity.
mr.
irving
galt
the
legislative
committee
merely,
if
it
wishes
to
--
and
i
don’t
know
of
any
legislative
inquiry
into
this
sort
of
situation,
certainly
not
recently;
there
may
have
been,
but
i
don’t
know
of
any.
but
a
legislative
committee
undertakes
such
studies,
theoretically
at
least
and
validly
at
least,
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
there
needs
to
be
amendment
to
legislation.
if
there
is
going
to
be
anything
of
criminal
consequence
involved
in
the
situation
--
mr.
irving
galt
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
except
that
--
mr.
irving
galt
pardon.
mr.
irving
galt
that’s
right.
but
the
only
difference
it
might
make
is
one
of
degree,
because
i
think
withthe
grand
jury
constituting
a
body
of
citizens
and
performing
one
of
its
traditional
and
most
important
historical
functions,
that
of
acting
as
surrogate
for
the
people,
the
matter
assumes
a
great
deal
more
seriousness
and
is
of
greater
consequence
to
the
proper
operation
of
the
political
system
in
new
york.
now,
we
have
spoken
of
use
immunity
before,
and
it’s
mr.
cunningham’s
or
one
of
mr.
cunningham’s
answers
in
this
argument
before
the
court,
that
were
he
to
be
granted
simply
use
immunity
that
he
would
be
willing
to
do
--
he
would
testify
under
use
rather
than
transactional
immunity;
that’s
how
i
understand
his
brief
to
argue.
aside
from
the
fact
that
there
is
serious
question
as
to
whether
use
immunity
could
be
had
in
a
grand
jury
proceeding
under
new
york
law,
i
pass
to
the
more
important
thing.
if
that
was
so,
if
he
could
have
use
immunity
and
not
relinquish
his
party
offices
and
testify
under
use
immunity,
and
unless
other
evidence
were
to
be
forthcoming
from
other
sources
going
beyond
the
scope
of
the
use
immunity,
the
public
distrust
would
only
be
greatly
enhanced,
greatly
exacerbated,
because
to
them
this
would
be
--
mr.
irving
galt
that’s
right.
mr.
irving
galt
no,
no.
i
was
saying
that
if
he
would
give
the
use
immunity,
he
would
do
that
in
exchange
for
not
being
removed
from
public
office,
he
would
testify
under
use
immunity.
he
might
ultimately
be
removed
in
public
office
if
he
were
ever
to
be
indicted
and
convicted
of
a
crime,
but
if
he
--
mr.
irving
galt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
continuing,
i
should
like
to
stress
why
the
grant
of
use
immunity
to
mr.
cunningham
would
be
totally
unacceptable
to
the
public.
they
would
undoubtedly
view
it
as
a
situation
simply
of
two
politicians
conspiring
together
for
the
purpose
of
having
one
of
them
confer
immunity
upon
the
other
in
exchange
for
an
agreement
to
confess.
this
of
course
would
heighten
public
suspicion
and
distrust
of
politicians
in
general,
and
the
very
idea
that
a
party
officer
can
only
be
compelled
to
account
for
his
performance
in
office,
only
on
the
condition
that
he
will
be
forever
insulated
from
prosecution
for
his
misdeeds
is
repellant.
it
is
repugnant
to
any
concept
of
justice
and
i
think
an
outrage,
which
the
constitution
could
never
have
intended
nor
condone,
and
i
think
new
york
should
certainly
be
permitted
to
convince
its
citizens
that
they
can
control
the
political
process
and
that
they
need
not
let
politicians
go
scot
free
simply
in
return
for
the
truth
as
to
the
exercise
of
the
public
trust
imposed
in
them.
now,
in
this
case
certainly,
mr.
cunningham
losses
no
employment,
looses
no
right
to
continue
in
his
professional
practice,
should
he
relinquish
his
party
offices
and
in
this
sense
there
is
a
very
significant
distinction
from
the
garrity
line
of
cases.
in
each
of
which,
there
was
substantial
economic
reprisal
as
the
price
for
the
exercise
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
it
makes
this
case
i
think
much
more
closely
resemble
the
fairly
recent
decision
of
this
court,
last
april
i
believe
in
baxter
against
palmigiano
where
it
was
said
by
this
court
that
a
negative
affect
without
substantial
economic
penalty
is
not
or
rather
is
a
consequence
constitutionally
permissible
under
the
fifth
amendment.
and
there
is
another
very
sharp
difference
among
many
others
from
the
garrity
line
of
cases,
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
mr.
cunningham
and
his
state
and
county
chairmanships
were
not
all
very
conspicuous,
very
visible,
highly
visible,
and
very
easily
identifiable
in
the
public
eye,
a
fact
which
was
not
present
in
any
of
the
garrity
line
of
cases.
now,
i
know
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
intended
to
protect
the
innocent
as
well
as
the
guilty
and
also
that
the
invoking
of
the
privilege
does
not
promote,
but
rather
tends
to
detract
from
the
truth
finding
process.
and
in
these
circumstances
one
may
well
ask
what
then
of
the
innocent
party
officer,
the
really
innocent
party
officer,
who
feels
impelled
or
feels
the
necessity
for
exercising
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
because
of
the
possibility
of
the
coincidence,
mistake
or
something
else
which
in
his
particular
situation
might
lead
to
mistaken
prosecution
and
conviction.
should
his
personal
interest
and
his
fears
of
the
mistaken
prosecution
or
conviction
outweigh
the
public
interest
in
procuring
and
accounting
of
what
he
did
and
what
he
is
doing
in
his
party
office
and
to
evaluate
the
integrity
of
the
party
officer,
his
office,
and
his
party?
i
think
the
answer
certainly
must
be
no,
because
only
he,
the
party
officer
is
in
a
position
himself
to
judge
the
likelihood
of
the
possibility
of
a
mistaken
conviction
and?
mr.
irving
galt
there
were
two
indictments
that
were
dismissed
from
which
the
new
special
prosecutor
is
appealing
which
occurred
subsequent
to
the
writing
of
the
briefs
and
i
believe
there
is
at
least
one
and
possibly
two
other
indictments
still
pending
against
mr.
cunningham.
that
is
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
i
do
not
say
that
with
absolute
certainty,
but
i
do
not
think,
i
will
be
contradicted
on
that
score.
mr.
irving
galt
in
what
respect
your
honor?
mr.
irving
galt
no
i
do
not
think
so.
in
the
first
place,
the
party
offices
with
the
exception
of
the
state
chairmanship
which
he
voluntarily
relinquished
as
i
explained
yesterday
about
a
month
ago,
he
still
holds.
in
the
second
place
our
statute
has
been
stricken
down
and
the
situation
is
very
much
in
the
public
eye
and
in
the
public
mind
in
new
york
and
of
course
there
is
though
very
great
likelihood
of
recurrence
of
such
situation
at
some
future
time,
but
from
every
standpoint
and
in
every
way
i
sincerely
submit
that
there
is
nothing
at
all
moot
about
this
case.
and
too,
if
i
may
continue
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
simply
say
that
i
had
suggested
that
a
no
was
the
only
answer
to
the
questions
i
had
hypothetically
posed
and
i
was
pointing
out
that
only
he
could
judge
the
likelihood
of
a
mistaken
conviction
and
it
is
perfectly
reasonable
to
have
a
statute
like
section
22,
which
has
the
effect
of
discouraging
him
from
making
the
choice
of
exercising
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
and
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
state's
paramount
interest,
its
very
strong
interest
in
maintaining,
its
very
compelling
interest
in
maintaining
the
integrity
of
its
political
system,
entitles
it
to
insist
that
a
party
officer
yield
his
office
in
a
very
special
situation
such
as
i
conjured
up
a
few
moments
ago,
in
order
to
assure
that
his
concern
over
his
personal
faith
will
not
transcend
the
need
to
prevent
putting
a
cloud
over
his
party,
over
his
office,
and
indeed
over
himself
in
the
public
mind
and
over
the
political
system
too.
mr.
irving
galt
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
thank
you
very
much.
