mr.
michael
e.
tigar
mr.
chief
justice
of
the
united
states;
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
constitutionality
of
new
york
election
law,
section
22,
which
is
reproduced
in
the
attorney
general's
brief
and
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes
it
has.
it
has
both
of
the
objectionable
features
which?
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes
it
does.
the
language
is
the
same
in
the
new
statute.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
that
is
true.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
the
refusal
was
based
upon
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes
mr.
justice
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
that
is
true
mr.
justice
stewart.
but
the
waiver
of
community,
which
he
refused
to
sign
is
couched
in
terms
of
a
waiver
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
that
is
true
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
i
think
that
under
the
circumstances
under
which
he
appeared
before
the
grand
jury,
it
was
clear
enough
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
that
is
true
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
he
simply
declined
to
waive
his
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
all
those
things
are
true.
i
think
the
case
becomes
clear
though
mr.
justice
stewart
by
reference
to
the
definition
in
the
statute
of
the
waiver
which
the
appellate
in
this
case
was
tendered.
if
i
understand
your
concern
rightly?
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
under
new
york's
procedure,
however,
the
waiver
of
immunity
is
typically
tendered
to
the
witness
prior
to
the
beginning
of
questioning
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
the
reason
for
that
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that
any
testimony
by
the
witness
before
the
grand
jury
triggers
new
york
statutory
transactional
immunity
provision
that
may
be
the
basis
for
the
prosecutor
making
double
sure
by
tendering
the
waiver
form
as
soon
as
the
witness
comes
into
the
grand
jury
room
and
is
sworn.
that
waiver
form
in
the
procedure
for
tendering
it
and
this
is
not
in
the
briefs
is
contained
in
mckinney's
forms
for
the
criminal
procedure
law
at
the
section
190.45,
form
i
and
section
190.45,
subdivision
1
of
new
york's
criminal
procedure
law
which
is
also
not
cited
in
the
briefs,
i
regret
to
say
deals
with
the
definition
of
waiver
of
immunity
and
makes
clear
that
it
is
a
waiver
of
all
protections
under
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
that
is
being
spoken
of.
now
the
failure
to
execute
this
form
upon
entry
into
the
grand
jury
triggers
new
york's
election
law
of
section
22.
a
party
officer
is
stripped
of
his
post.
the
positions
to
which
he
was
elected
by
suffrage
of
his
fellow
members
of
the
democratic
party,
a
voluntary
political
association
and
for
five
years
thereafter
he
is
ineligible
to
hold
any
party
or
public
office.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
may
i
beg
to
differ
with
you
mr.
justice
stewart?
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
for
example
under
section
6002
and
6003
of
title
18
united
states
code,
immunity
is
typically
conferred
upon
a
witness
and
the
authorization
to
confer
such
immunity
is
given
as
i
recall
by
the
assistant
attorney
general
when
it
is
possible
or
probable
that
a
witness
may
invoke
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
that
is
true.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
they
may
very
well
be
true.
however,
as
new
york
has
interpreted
its
procedure,
the
immunity
grant
typically
or
very
often
to
takes
place
prior
to
the
invocation
of
the
privilege
simply
as
a
house-keeping
detail
and
i
was
pointing
out
that
that
house-keeping
detail
was
also
true
in
federal
immunity
grants
under
section
6002,
6003.
in
fact,
i
supposed
that
this
court
has
also
considered
other
cases
such
as
reilly
against
ohio
360
us
423
in
which
the
scope
for
the
petitioner's
fifth
amendment
protection
before
the
ohio
committee
was
made
clear
to
them
before
they
ever
testified
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
the
court
considered
their
convictions
for
contempt.
in
dealing
with
these
questions?.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
that
is
true
mr.
justice
stewart
and
the
new
statute
is
in
a
1976
pamphlet
supplement
to
new
york's
election
law
in
the
mckinney's
version.
the
term
party
office
is
quite
broad.
at
page
27
of
the
appellant's
appendix,
it
is
clear
that
party
office
includes
the
right
to
be
a
delegate
to
the
democratic
convention
that
is
in
the
rules
of
the
democratic
party.
at
page
35,
section
5
of
that
section,
it
is
clear
that
party
office
may
also
include
membership
in
the
democratic
national
committee
because
new
york's
representatives
on
the
democratic
national
committee,
including
mr.
cunningham,
are
selected
by
the
state
democratic
committee.
that
then
is
the
statute
which
the
court
confronts.
now,
from
garrity
and
spevack
in
the
1966
term,
holding
that
the
state
may
not
make
the
invocation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
costly
by
penalizing,
through
gardner
and
sanitation
men
in
the
1967
term,
both
of
which
struck
down
new
york
statutes,
cast
from
the
same
mold
as
election
law
of
section
22
and
applied
to
municipal
employees
in
those
cases.
lefkowitz
v.
turley
in
the
1973
term,
involving
persons
with
whom
the
state
was
contracting,
who
would
also
be
disqualified
from
contracting
with
the
state
if
they
invoked
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
or
as
mr.
justice
stewart
aptly
points
out,
refuse
to
execute
the
waiver
of
immunity.
the
teaching
of
the
court
has
been
consistent
and
clear.
all
members
of
the
court
conquered
in
the
judgment
in
the
judgment
in
gardner
and
sanitation
men
and
mr.
justice
white's
opinion
in
lefkowitz
v.
turley
was
an
opinion
for
all
members
of
the
court.
recognizing
that
the
state
can
compel
an
accounting
by
holders
of
a
public
trust
if
it
simply
takes
measures
to
grant
use
immunity.
the
question
today,
therefore,
is
whether
those
cases
spoke
with
an
uncertain
sound
or
paltered
in
a
double
sense.
the
three
judge
court
did
not
take
a
great
deal
of
time
in
concluding
that
they
did
not.
and
the
appellant
argues
differently
of
what
it
is
seems
to
us
is
three
reasons.
now
the
appellant
claims
that
it
is
alright
to
strip
a
party
officer
of
the
post
to
which
he
was
elected
by
the
suffrage
of
his
fellow
party
members
and
that
this
intrusion
into
voluntary
political
association
is
permissible
and
that
this
can
be
done
for
the
sole
and
single
reason
of
a
refusal
to
execute
a
waiver
of
immunity
before
a
grand
jury
or
the
invocation
of
a
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
again,
before
a
grand
jury
meeting
in
secret
and
that
further,
the
punishment
of
a
5-year
disqualification
from
public
or
party
office
may
likewise
be
exacted.
the
first
claim
is
if
the
court
please,
that
the
state
somehow
possesses
a
different
interest
in
the
political
process
then
it
possesses
when
considering
the
fidelity
to
their
trust
of
employees
such
as
policeman
and
sanitation
men
and
persons
with
whom
the
state
does
business
such
as
contractors
and
architects.
the
argument
if
the
court
please,
cuts
the
other
way.
this
court
has
recognized.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
if
the
attorney
general
is
considered
to
be
an
office
who
serves
at
the
pleasure
of
the
president
then
there
is
no
constitutional
inhibition
against
his
doing
so.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
i
do
not
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
think
the
analogous
case
here
would
be
the
congress
passing
a
statute
which
said
the
attorney
general
who
serves
at
the
pleasure
of
the
president
would
be
removed
from
office
if
he
invokes
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
for
officers,
who
serve
solely
at
his
pleasure,
the
president
could
make
such
a
requirement.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
because
mr.
justice
stevens,
we
have
then
the
intrusion
by
the
legislative
branch
into
the
process
of
selection
of
political
officers
by
the
president
of
the
united
states,
just
as
here
we
have
the
intrusion
by
new
york
into
the
voter
choice
and
democratic
party
member
choice.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
if
the
congress
so
provided
with
respect
to
its
own
employees,
mr.
justice
steven,
which
is
not
our
case,
then
the
court
would
have
to
revisit
the
teaching
of
such
cases
as
beilan
and
lerner
against
casey.
the
court
will
recall
i
am
sure
that
in
those
cases,
professor
beilan
and
mr.
lerner,
who
i
think
opened
and
shut
subway
doors
were
permitted
to
be
discharged
from
that
position
for
lack
of
candor.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
think
the
point
is
the
same.
this
court
has
said,
although
by
narrow
majorities
in
cases
that
go
back
some
20
years
that
an
employer
may
insist
upon
candor
from
his
employees
and
having
failed
to
exact
that
requirement
of
candor,
the
employee
not
having
owned
up
as
what
he
did,
there
may
be
a
basis
for
discharge
that
it
would
not
be
an
impermissible
inference
from
silence
in
that
case,
taking
together
with
all
the
other
facts
to
permit
discharge.
the
difference
of
course
in
beilan
and
lerner
is
that
the
inference
which
was
drawn
from
silence
was
drawn
only
after
a
full
due
process
hearing
in
each
case,
and
if
your
question
assumes
that
such
a
hearing
would
be
held
then
those
cases
--
the
case
you
put
maybe
indistinguishable
from
baxter
against
palmigiano.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
there
is
no
constitutional
difference,
saved
as
the
facts
of
a
particular
case
may
cause
one
to
arise,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
is
to
say
an
employer
who
is
acting
with
respect
to
an
employee
or
servant
who
has
no
protectable
interest
in
continued
employment
is
permitted
a
great
deal
more
latitude
in
discharging.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
mr.
justice.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
i
think
an
argument
could
be
made
that
no
such
difference
exists,
mr.
justice
stevens,
but
i
fear
very
much
that
the
argument
would
be
diluted
by
the
continued
vitality,
if
any,
it
has
of
nelson
against
county
of
los
angeles
in
which
the
court
evenly
divided
with
respect
to
petitioner
nelson
with
five-to-four
upheld
discharge
of
the
non-tenured
probationary
employee
globe,
who
was
a
co-petitioner.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
tenure
is
of
no
importance
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
stevens,
for
a
due
process
reason
as
well
as
a
fifth
amendment
reason.
your
case,
i
think,
poses
a
due
process
problem.
that
is
to
say
what
is
the
scope
and
extent
of
the
permissible
inference
from
silence
and
i
would
assume
that
silence
could
be
given
no
more
weight
than
to
which
it
was
lawfully
entitled
and
that
the
way
it
would
take
place
under
circumstances
permitted
by
this
court's
holdings
construing
the
due
process
rights
of
employees
or
public
officers
as
the
case
maybe.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
it
is
the
assertion
of
the
constitutional
privilege.
silence
was
merely
a
shorthand
way
of?
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
i
agree
with
that
formulation,
mr.
justice
stewart,
say,
of
course
in
doyle
against
ohio
situation
when
the
assertion
of
the
right
is...
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
of
course
not.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
the
teaching
of
lefkowitz
against
turley
in
those
cases
is
that
there
is
no
difference.
however,
in
candid
reply
to
mr.
justice
stevens,
this
court
has
never
overruled
beilan
and
lerner
against
casey,
i
concede
that
fact.
i
do
not
think
to
that
concession
affects
the
outcome
in
this
case,
but
those
cases
were
decided
and
they
did
hold
that
that
lack
of
candor
was
a
basis
for
discharge,
although
after
as
i
pointed
out
in
an
appropriate
hearing,
and
so
long
as
those
cases
have
not
been
overruled,
candor
compels
the
concession
which
i
..
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes
of
course.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
your
question
was
without
waiving
immunity?
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
and
lefkowitz
against
turley
so
holds.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
writing
on
a
clean
slate,
i
would
make
the
same
answer
with
respect
to
the
president
and
the
attorney
general,
although
i
think
the
case
is
weaker
because
of
the
fact
of
service
at
the
pleasure
of
and
i
think
that
the
power
even
of
public
officers
with
respect
to
those
who
they
choose
to
be
their
confidential
aides
may
be
rather
greater
than
in
other
circumstances.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
i
would
hesitate,
mr.
chief
justice,
only
at
the
point
where
such
things
as
racial
or
sexual
discrimination
came
into
the
picture,
there
may
be
other
values
at
stake,
but
in
general,
mr.
chief
justice
you
are
right.
i
want
to
emphasize
though
that
that
is
not
our
case.
here
we
have
someone
who
was
elected
to
his
position.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
he
has
a
term
and
i
was
about
to
observe
that
this
is
then
is
a
stronger
case
then
the
public
employee
cases.
i
cannot
put
it
as
well.
i
do
not
think
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
concurring
and
dissenting
in
buckley
v.
valeo,
pointing
out
that
the
power
of
government
is
at
its
most
attenuated
when
intruding
into
the
process
of
choice
by
voluntary
political
associations
and
that
the
power
of
government
is
rather
greater,
when
it
is
such
a
thing
as
the
employment
relationship
that
is
at
stake.
citing
as
a
hard
case,
pickering
against
board
of
education
in
which
the
right
that
was
held
to
be
somewhat
diluted
by
the
employment
status
recognized
to
be
somewhat
diluted
by
the
employment
status
was
that
of?
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
mr.
justice
stevens,
the
position
of
democratic
state
chairman
under
those
circumstances
can
be
lost
pursuant
to
election
law
section
16
which
provides
that
the
member
of
a
party
committee
may
be
removed
by
such
committee
for
disloyalty,
however,
after
notice
and
hearing
upon
written
charges.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no
we
do
not
contend.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
well,
it
is
irrelevant
except
to
point
out
that
the
statute
also
provides
for
removal
for
corruption.
so
that
if
the
bronx
county
committee
or
the
new
york
state
committee
wants
to
remove
mr.
cunningham
they
have
device
to
do
it.
they
are
not
left
remedy
less
(ph)
by
any
decision
that
the
court
might
make
in
this
case.
the
second
contention
that
is
made
is
the
party
positions
are
unsalaried
and
hence
mr.
cunningham
does
not
suffer
any
economic
harm.
the
three-judge
court
that
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
pages
13a
through
15a,
made
short
work
of
that
contention.
i
suppose
there
are
observation
that
really
rested
upon
something
that
was
said
in
watts
against
indiana,
they
were
unwilling
to
ignore
its
judges
that
which
they
knew
as
men
and
that
is
that
is
forcing
mr.
cunningham
out
under
a
cloud
is
bound
to
have
an
economic
impact
to
rather
considerable
character
on
it.
the
test
is
not
how
many
dollars
it
costs,
but
whether
the
invocation
is
costly,
and
in
terms
of
obliquely
and
dishonor
it
is
certainly
is
costly,
and
that
is
not
even
to
reach,
although
i
think
the
court
may
wish
to
consider
it
the
five-year
disqualification
provision
which
in
a
series
of
cases
beginning
with
cummings
against
missouri
is
classic
kind
of
punishment
it
seems
to
me
and
is
recognized
as
a
classic
kind
of
punishment
at
least
as
far
back
as
blackstone
summary
of
the
impeachment
power
of
parliament.
the
court,
i
think
has
been
assiduous
irrespective
of
economic
consequences
to
protect
against
any
sanction
or
burden
on
rights
guaranteed
or
any
singling
out
of
those
who
invoke
rights
or
seem
likely
to
invoke
rights
for
some
invidious
treatment.
it
is
not
unique
to
the
fifth
amendment
context
is
my
point,
harman
against
forsseniusin
380
us
struck
down
a
burden
on
the
right
to
vote
which
was
thought
to
be
in
violation
of
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
(inaudible)
lamont
against
postmaster
general
said
that
you
could
not
condition
the
right
of
free
speech
as
it
operated
through
the
mail
by
so
much
as
requiring
sending
of
a
postcard
and
of
course
the
garrity,
turley
line
of
cases.
the
3rd
argument
if
the
court
please,
is
that
baxter
against
palmigiano
somehow
changes
things.
that
was
the
discussion
that
mr.
justice
stevens
and
i
were
having
a
few
moments
ago
about
the
inference
to
be
drawn
from
silence.
i
think
the
court
would
agree,
i
hope
the
court
agrees
that
there
is
a
great
difference
between
making
a
conclusive
presumption
of
unfitness
from
the
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
permitting
some
inference
wherever
the
silence
is
worth
inference
or
the
invocation
of
privileges
worth
to
be
drawn
in
a
context
outside
criminal
cases,
which
are
of
course
governed
by
griffin
against
california.
this
is
really
a
due
process
question.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
i
recognized
that
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
the
course
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
an
instruction
to
the
jury,
if
he
is
fool
enough
to
ask
for
it,
but
they
are
not
to
think
about
the
fact
that
he
or
she
did
not
take
the
stand
to
the
extent
the
jury's
fault.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
i
understand
that
mr.
justice
stewart.
my
only
observation
would
be
that
you
are
entitled
to
the
instruction
of
the
jury
that
they
may
not
draw
such
an
inference
to
the
extent
those
instructions
work
why
inferences
are
not
drawn.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
it
is
mr.
justice
stewart
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
i
would
take
it
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
if
it
is
to?
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
against
compulsory
self-incrimination.
if
it
is
to
have
some
meaningful
place
in
the
constitution,
it
must
include
the
right
of
a
grand
jury
witness
under
new
york's
peculiar
system.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
i
understand
that
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
if
a
witness
who
is
offered
a
waiver
of
immunity
under
new
york's
procedure
is
offered
it
at
the
threshold
of
the
grand
jury
inquiry.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
that
is
true,
and
if
his,
however,
his
refusal
to
sign
a
piece
of
paper,
which
unequivocally
waives
all
immunities
and
privileges,
which
he
would
otherwise
have
under
the
provision
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
new
york,
that
refusal
and
attaching
consequences
to
it
surely
raises
a
fifth
amendment
issue
because
the
intention
of
the
party
to
rely
upon
the
fifth
amendment
when
refusing
to
sign
this
waiver
could
not
be
clear.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
but
in
addition
the
constitutional
right
arises
because
that
is
the
step
for
time,
the
only
time
when
new
york
permits
him
to
do
anything
to
avoid
the
automatic
mouse
trap
effective
election
law,
section
22.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
they
demanded
the
waiver.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
then
he
has
immunity.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
the
case
is
not
different
mr.
justice
white
from
a
situation
in
the
station
house
with
the
35.50
under
the
miranda
warning
and
then
the
police
officer
saying
would
you
like
to
waive
your
privilege
against
self-incrimination
before
the
accused
says
anything
and
if
you
do
not
by
the
way
i
am
going
to
punish
you.
now,
this
court
i
think
would
have
little
difficulty
in
holding
that
violated
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
finally
i
would
like
to
say
a
word,
if
i
may,
about
the
circumstances
under
which
this
refusal
to
sign
the
waiver
took
place.
this
court
in
the
greenwald
case
dealing
with
the
situation
of
petitioner
26.27
explored
the
reasons
why
someone
might
want
to
take
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
i
would
like
read
to
the
court
from
justice
sandler's
opinion
dismissing
the
corruption
indictments
against
mr.
cunningham,
referring
to
the
subpoena
hearing
issue.
a
motion
to
quash
was
made
on
mr.
cunningham's
behalf
that
challenged
vigorously
the
good
faith
underlying
the
service
of
this
process.
this
was
responded
to
by
the
former
special
prosecutor
and
affidavit
that
condemned
mr.
cunningham
in
sweeping
terms
as
a
central
figure
in
widespread
criminality
affecting
nominations
for
judicial
and
other
offices.
basic
fairness
requires
it
to
be
said
explicitly,
is
indisputably
established
by
the
record
of
these
grand
jury
proceedings
that
this
charge
was
not
justified
by
the
evidence
then
at
his
disposal
and
was
not
substantiated
by
the
investigation
that
followed.
that
which
is
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
record
of
the
state
of
new
york,
i
think
puts
this
matter
in
context
and
demonstrates
really
quite,
we
think
this
case
is
as
important
as
we
believe
it
to
be,
that
is
any
district
attorney
in
new
york
state
in
any
county
can
hail
someone
before
the
grand
jury
under
these
circumstances
and
cause
a
forfeiture
of
party
office
by
the
tactics
here
used.
thank
you.
