chief

e.
burger
mr.
galt,
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
the
indictment
has
been
dismissed
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
about
there
being
a
continuing
controversy
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
possibility
that
this
has
been
mooted
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
galt,
your
time
is
expired.

since
the
briefs
were
filed,
new
york's
legislature
has
amended
section
22
of
the
election
law
and
that
new
version
goes
into
effect
on
december
1,
1977.
the
new
law
is
substantially
similar
to
the
old.
it
just
differences
in
phrasing
and
punctuation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
has
the
same
basic...
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
tigar,
let
me
just
be
clear,
and
i
clarify
my
question
a
little
bit.
putting
aside,
beside
decided
cases
for
a
moment,
assuming
we
are
writing
on
a
completely
clean
slate
for
the
moment
and
suppose
we
had
here
instead
of
a
statutory
restriction
that
we
had
an
officer
who
was
appointed
by
the
governor,
and
the
governor
made
this
regulation
or
term
or
condition
of
holding
the
job.
he
said
you
can
be
the
chairman
of
the
state
central
committee,
provided
you
are
willing
to
testify
whenever
you
are
called
before
a
grand
jury
without
waiving
any
right
of
immunity.
could
the
governor
impose
such
a
restriction
in
connection
with
appointing
an
officer
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
could
he
require
that
there
be
a
way
of
the
complete
candor
and
testimony
and
in
addition
to
that
because
of
the
public
interest,
the
argument
your
opponent
makes,
that
he
also
required
the
man
to
be
willing
to
waive
his
immunity
as
a
condition
to
taking
this
job.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
very
purpose
of
the
tenure
of
office
measured
by
the
pleasure
of
the
appointing
authority
that
is
at
the
pleasure
of
the
president
means
the
president
can
as
soon
as
displeasure
occurs,
if
a
cabinet
officer
tells
a
bad
racial
joke,
he
can
be
terminated
for
that
reason,
can't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
if
they
had
bad
manners
at
a
white
house
dinner,
got
intoxicated.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
has
tenure.
he
has
a
term,
does
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
the
notice
and
hearing
would
not
say
this
statute.
i
do
not
think
you
are
really
contending
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
that
is
irrelevant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
are
saying
is
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
refuse
to
sign
a
waiver
and
that
he
has
exercised
that
constitutional
right
here,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
