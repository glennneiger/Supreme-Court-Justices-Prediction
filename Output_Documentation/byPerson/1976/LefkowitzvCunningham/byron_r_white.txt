what
these
people
will
be
requested
to
do
is
not
just
waive
transactional
immunity,
but
to
waive
use
immunity
or
any
kind
of
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
what
i
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know;
but
the
state
didn’t
say
to
him,
"and
by
the
way,
we
would
be
satisfied
to
leave
you
with
use
immunity."
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know;
but
the
state
didn’t
say
to
them,
the
state
said
whatever,
"we
demand
that
you
waive
immunity
broadly
...
"
justice
byron
r.
white
"we
would
not
be
satisfied
to
have
you
retain
use
immunity."
justice
byron
r.
white
the
waiver
demanded
waive
use
immunity,
as
well
as
anything
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
pardon?
justice
byron
r.
white
that

not
do
anything,
if
they
did
not
demand
and
you
say
offering
the
waiver,
they
demanded
waiver.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
he
waived.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they
did
not
demanded
it
at
that
time
and
if
he
did
not
sign
it
and
then
went
on
and
asking
the
question
and
he
answered,
he
might
be
well
disposed
never
to
claim
the
privilege,
just
answered
because
then
he
as
automatic
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
so
is
the
state
that
is
interested
at
this
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
having
a
wavier
before
they
ask
any
questions.
