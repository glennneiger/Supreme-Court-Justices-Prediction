justice
potter
stewart
and
one
of
them
is
very
odd
feature
something
that
it
leaves
out.
it
never
says
anything
about
the
party
officer
who
has
called
asserting
any
right
against
compulsory
self
incrimination
that
is
not
in
statute
at
all.
does
that
defect
remain
in
the
present
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
where
now
it
appears
his
refusal
to
testify
might
be
based
upon
his
unwillingness
to
be
embarrassed
or
unwillingness
to
violate
a
confidential
conversation
or
all
sorts
of
perfectly
invalid
reasons
to
testify
that
is
to
refail
to
testify
that
is
constitutionally
invalid.
that
is
not
covered
at
all
by
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
no
question,
no
provision
at
all
here
that
his
refusal
must
be
based
upon
the
assertion
of
his
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination.
justice
potter
stewart
he
refused
to
sign
a
waiver.
justice
potter
stewart
he
never
was
asked
a
question
and
never
refused
to
answer
a
question,
did
he?
you
made
that
point.
justice
potter
stewart
well
certainly,
but
nobody
gets
a
waiver
until
or
unless
he
has
asserted
his
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
person
never
did.
your
client
never
did
it.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
privilege
against
self-incrimination
of
the
constitution.
there
is
a
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
is
not
clear
at
all
because
he
was
never
asked
a
question
and
he
never
asserted
any
such
privilege.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
a
waiver,
nobody
is
entitled
to
a
waiver
at
all,
until
or
unless
he
has
asserted
his
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination.
your
client
never
did.
the
statute
does
not
require
that
he
do
so.
he
could
be
refusing
the
answer
on
the
basis
that
he
is
violating
some
confidence
or
that
he
is
embarrassing
his
friend
or
all
sorts
of
non-constitutional
reasons.
justice
potter
stewart
a
waiver
never
becomes
relevant
until
or
unless
somebody
has
asserted
his
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination.
then
he
may
refuse
to
answer
if
that
assertion
is
upheld.
he
may
refuse
to
answer
until
or
unless
he
is
granted
a
constitutionally
sufficient
immunity.
justice
potter
stewart
very
odd
procedure.
justice
potter
stewart
he
is
not
entitled
to
any
immunity
until
a
valid
claim
against
compulsory
self-incrimination
has
been
asserted.
so
waiver
of
immunity
is
irrelevant
until
or
unless
he
has
asserted
a
constitutional
privilege
and
that
has
been
upheld.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
please.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
any
prosecuting
attorney
anywhere
from
granting,
if
he
is
authorized
by
statute
or
otherwise
to
grant
any
witness
immunity
from
prosecution
on
any
basis.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
witness
is
not
constitutionally
entitled
to
that
that
is
my
point.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
the
present
statute,
the
amended
statue
shares
this
statute's
language
and
so
far
it
does
not
require
any
assertion
of
the
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination.
justice
potter
stewart
again
silence
is
not
the
assertion
of
the
constitutional
privilege.
the
silence
might
be
attributable
to
all
sorts
of
motivations.
justice
potter
stewart
the
man
involved
miranda,
that
involved
miranda
warnings
in
a
very
specific
context
and
certainly
the
rules
that
governed
most
employers
which
would
certainly
entitle
any
employer
if
a
private
employer,
a
doctor
came
into
his
office
and
his
glasses
were
missing
off
his
desk
and
he
asked
his
secretary,
did
you
take
my
glasses
and
she
said,
well,
i
refuse
to
answer
on
the
basis
that
it
might
incriminate
me,
he
could
say
you
are
fired
on
the
spot
and
there
would
be
no
constitutional
implication
whatsoever.
justice
potter
stewart
and
when
government
does
it,
you
are
dealing
with
quite
a
different
thing
and
why
is
it
different
if
the
executive
branch
or
the
legislative
branch
does
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
lack
of
candor
or
silence,
and
i
think
you
agree
is
quite
a
different
thing
from
the
assertion
of
the
constitutional
privilege,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
only
has
to
do
with
a
comment
on
it.
no
power
on
earth,
this
court
or
any
greater
or
lesser
power
can
prevent
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
a
refusal
to
testify.
justice
potter
stewart
normally
it
has
to
do
upon
comments
on
it.
you
cannot
prevent
the
inference
being
drawn,
whatever
inference
that
the
jury
wants
to
draw.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
are
entitled
certainly
under
griffin,
specifically
not
to
have
the
prosecutor
comment
on
your
refusal.
i
am
still
troubled
with,
what
prompted
my
first
question
to
you
mr.
tigar.
your
whole
argument
is
that
the
constitutional
advice
in
this
statute
is
that
it
imposes
a
burden
upon
the
insertion
of
a
constitutional
right,
if
i
misapprehend
you,
that
is
it,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
my
problem
is
that
in
this
case
there
was
no
assertion
of
the
constitutional
right
because
at
the
time
he
declined
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
he
was
not
constitutionally
entitled
to
immunity.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
against
compulsory
self.
justice
potter
stewart
we
are
talking
about
new
york
state's
constitution
not
new
york's
peculiar
system.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
more
than
that
to
which
he
is
constitutionally
entitled
if
he
is
offered
it
at
that
time.
you
would
agree
with
that.
