mr.
galt,
was
this
section
22
a
part
of
that
series
of
enactments?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
tigar,
can
i
interrupt
quite
on
this
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
that
the
president
of
united
states
told
the
attorney
general
that
if
you
take
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
in
connection
with
a
grand
jury
investigation
of
watergate
or
matters
of
that
kind,
i
will
cause
you
to
be
removed
from
office;
could
he
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
these
cases
do
not
apply
to
people
who
serve
that
they
do
not
have
tenure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
concede
the
president
could
make
this
requirement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
then
why
cannot
the
congress
make
the
requirement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
the
congress
so
provide
with
respect
to
its
own
employees,
with
respect
to
say
the
sergeant-at-arms
of
the
senate
or
the
chief
counsel
of
the
judiciary
committee,
some
office
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
taking
about
an
officer,
an
employee
with
the
public
responsibility
comparable
to
the
attorney
general
in
high
office.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
am
just
wondering
where
you
will
find
in
the
fifth
amendment
which
is
a
constitutional
provision
on
which
you
rely,
a
distinction
between
the
requirement
being
imposed
by
the
executive
and
the
requirement
being
imposed
by
the
legislature.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
do
not
think
the
availability
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
the
importance
of
that
right
turns
at
all
on
whether
the
individual
has
tenure
or
does
not
when
his
job
is
at
stake,
when
he
is
told
in
effect,
if
you
exercise
your
privilege,
you
will
lose
your
job.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
not
make
any
difference
in
the
constitutional
terms
whether
that
job
is
one
that
he
holds
at
will
or
is
one
that
he
holds
with
some
sort
of
tenure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
view?
does
it
make
any
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
tenure
of
any
importance
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
is
not
silence
as
it
is
the
assertion
of
the
constitutional
privilege?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
well
it
does
not
hold
with
respect
to
this
kind
of
office
of
course
and
you
would
--
to
me
would
you
make
the
same
answer
with
respect
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
the
attorney
general
writing
on
a
clean
slate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wonder
if
that
argument
does
not
prove
too
much
mr.
tigar.
supposing
the
statute
said
that
you
loose
your
position
as
democratic
state
chairman
if
you
vote
for
the
republican
ticket.
