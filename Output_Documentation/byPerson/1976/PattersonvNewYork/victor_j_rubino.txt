mr.
victor
j.
rubino
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
four-to-three
decision
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
affirming
appellant’s
conviction
for
murder
and
specifically
rejecting
his
claim
that
the
new
york
statutes
pursuant
to
which
he
was
convicted
of
murder,
violated
his
due
process
rights
under
the
14th
amendment
and
that
the
new
york
statutes
required
him
to
bear
the
persuasion
burden
at
his
trial
for
murder
on
the
issue
of
provocation,
which
in
new
york
is
the
model
penal
code
formulation
extreme
emotional
disturbance.
the
issue
on
this
appeal
is
whether
they
are
placing
that
persuasion
burden
on
appellant
at
his
trial
in
order
to
allow
him
to
exonerate
himself
of
murder
and
be
convicted
only
of
manslaughter
in
fact
violates
his
due
process
rights
specifically
in
light
of
this
court’s
decisions
in
in
re
winship
and
mullaney
versus
wilbur.
it
is
appellant’s
contention
on
this
appeal
that
a
reversal
of
his
convictions
require
because
there
is
a
functional
identity
between
the
challenge
to
rule
here
of
new
york
state
and
the
rule
invalidated
by
this
court
unanimously
in
mullaney
and
furthermore
that
in
mullaney,
the
state
of
maine
argued
that
in
fact
there
was
only
one
generic
crime
of
felonious
homicide
and
that
the
provocation
issue
only
distinguished
two
punishment
categories;
cold
murder
and
manslaughter.
it
is
clear
in
new
york,
there
are
two
distinct
crimes
of
murder
and
manslaughter
and
therefore
it
is
more
clear
violation
of
winship.
i
would
like
to
stress
at
the
outset
that
this
appeal
presents
a
challenge
to
one
rule,
the
provocation
rule
as
formulated
by
the
model
penal
code
extreme
emotional
disturbance
and
i
think
now
would
only
affect
two
states;
new
york
and
connecticut
in
appendix
a
to
our
brief,
we
have
listed
the
states
which
have
adopted
the
extreme
emotional
disturbance
defense
and
shown
which
states
have
place
the
burden
persuasion
on
the
defendant.
currently,
it
is
only
new
york
and
connecticut.
in
connecticut
there
are
now
two
lower
court
opinions
applying
mullaney
to
place
the
burden
on
the
state
that
is
in
two
trial
courts
in
two
counties
out
of
the
six
in
connecticut.
so,
the
issue
on
this
appeal
is
we
argue
very
narrow,
one
rule
arguably
affecting
two
states.
mr.
victor
j.
rubino
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
starting
point
is
to
understand
that
extreme
emotional
disturbance
was
a
formulation
to
expand
the
concept
of
provocation
and
that
it
carried
with
it
the
requirement
that
there
would
be
a
reasonable
explanation
or
excuse
for
the
defendant’s
conduct.
i
guess
the
only
way
i
can
state
the
differences
is
to
say
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
that
insanity
one
would
have
to
not
only
show
a
certain
state
of
insanity
or
certain
disease,
but
then
say
i
have
a
reasonable
excuse
for
that.
i
think
the
very
concept
of
insanity
leaves
aside
that
kind
of
objective
standard
that
ultimately
anchors
each
of
the
two
concepts.
in
other
words
provocation
is
must
be
explained.
it
also
goes
less
--
insanity
goes
to
the
intellect
to
knowing
right
from
wrong
and
then
there
is
no
such
question
posed
in
the
extreme
emotional
disturbance.
mr.
victor
j.
rubino
no.
mr.
victor
j.
rubino
the
impact
is
that
at
that
at
the
time
at
which
he
has
lost
his
selfcontrol,
it
does
not
mean
he
does
not
know
right
from
wrong;
it
is
not
a
test.
in
other
words,
he
does
indeed
had
no
disease
or
defect.
in
fact,
it
assumes
basically
that
he
is
a
rational
man
who
has
then
lost
selfcontrol
just
as
of
provocation
was
described
by
this
court
in
mullaney.
mr.
victor
j.
rubino
i
think
it
is
broader,
your
honor;
i
think
when
you
say
equate,
i
would
equate
it
only
in
the
sense
that
it
performs
the
same
function
that
that
function
is
to
distinguish
between
the
crime
of
murder
and
the
crime
of
manslaughter.
i
would
further
say
that
it
is
clear
in
lafave
&
scott,
for
instance,
they
do
use
the
term
interchangeably
when
they
speak
of
heat
of
passion,
they
then
say
extreme
emotional
disturbance.
mr.
victor
j.
rubino
lafave
&
scott,
your
honor,
in
the
section
starting
at
page
572
to
582
in
discussing
heat
of
passion
doctrines.
it
is
also
interesting
to
look
at
those
ten
pages
in
lafave
&
scott
and
compare
them,
we
have
an
appendix
b,
put
together
the
comments
under
the
model
penal
code
concerning
the
revise
formulation
heat
of
passion
and
not
only
the
model
penal
code
but
the
revisers
in
new
york,
the
staff
notes.
if
we
compare
the
various
ways
in
which
it
was
believed
extreme
emotional
disturbance
would
expand
the
provocation
concept,
we
can
see
that
it
is
still
anchored
in
provocation
but
it
simply
opens
up
more
situations
and
i
would
like,
your
honor,
to
go
through
those.
the
point
being
that
in
each
of
the
situations
that
extreme
emotional
disturbance
expands
or
so
called
expands
the
provocation
concept
of
heat
of
passion,
if
we
examine
lafave
&
scott,
we
see
that
there
are
already
some
states
under
the
heat
of
passion
concept
that
had
arrived
there
and
so
that
ultimately
what
are
we
dealing
with,
we
have
a
label.
the
new
label
entails
more
liberal
scope
provocation
but
it
does
not
different
conceptually
or
functionally.
i
may
just
take
one
example
because
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
stressed
this
particular
liberalization
in
its
opinion
and
that
is
cooling
time.
under
some
heat
of
passion
rules
cooling
time
was
fairly
restricted
and
that
the
provocation
had
to
spontaneously
cause
loss
of
control
and
lead
to
the
killing
and
it
was
within
a
very
limited
time
frame
so
that
the
defendant
could
not
have
cool
down.
in
another
words,
if
he
was
provoked
last
month
by
someone,
he
could
not
go
a
month
later
and
just
shoot
him
and
claimed
provocation.
the
point
is
that
the
extreme
emotional
disturbance
formulation
allows
a
longer
cooling
time,
allows
as
the
court
of
appeals
put
it
a
certain
amount
of
brooding,
this
is
i
think
professor
wexler’s
concept
that
in
fact
heat
of
passion
or
provocation
and
deliberation
are
not
really
mutually
exclusive
that
if
you
think
about
it,
you
can,
by
deliberating,
get
more
exercised
about
something
rather
than
less
and
the
extreme
emotional
disturbance
concept
was
to
allow
a
broader
period
of
time.
but
the
point
is
that
now
that
you
have
a
longer
cooling
time
sort
of
speak
allowed
what
does
that
difference
mean
constitutionally,
why
should
that
require
a
less
reliable
verdict
of
murder
in
new
york
as
oppose
maine.
if
it
went
to
hardship
that
might
be
an
argument
but
the
facts
of
this
case
show
that
al
longer
cooling
time
here
as,
for
instance,
in
self-defense
where
you
deal
with
antecedent
circumstances
where
you
claim
that
you
were
afraid
of
the
victim
and
that’s
you
shot,
may
go
back
a
year,
a
year-and-a-half,
but
the
time
period
is
filled
with
specific
tangible
facts
and
events.
nothing
especial,
the
facts
of
this
case
are
not
exotic
in
terms
of
provocation.
it
is
a
fairly
plastic
provocation
situation
in
overall
context
that
is
the
love
triangle
and
the
adultery
situation.
so
that
we
have
tried
to
show
in
our
brief
that
when
we
say
functional
identity
between
the
new
york
and
maine
rules,
we
are
saying
that
these
rules
exist
to
distinguish
murder
from
manslaughter;
that
there
are
significant
punishment
differentials.
in
new
york,
extreme
emotional
disturbance
distinguishes
between
murder
in
the
first-degree
as
well
as
murder
in
the
second-degree
in
manslaughter
and
in
fact
in
murder
in
the
first-degree,
the
reduction
is
not
to
murder
in
the
second-degree
but
to
manslaughter,
which
clearly
shows
not
simply
a
dropping
down
when
you
prove
the
extreme
emotion
disturbance
issue
but
it
shows
the
distinction
clearly
between
the
crime
of
murder
in
new
york
and
the
crime
of
manslaughter.
winship
was
the
determinable
case
in
this
area,
it
explicitly
established
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause
requires
and
in
the
words
of
winship,
proof
of
every
fact,
which
goes
to
constitute
the
crime.
i
think
the
problem
that
mullaney
presented
in
terms
of
interpretation
was
that
in
fact
the
state
of
maine
said
we
only
have
crime
of
felonious
homicide
and
we
have
proved
it;
we
have
proved
an
intentional
killing.
the
response
of
this
court
was
that
we
will
look
to
the
substance
of
your
law
and
not
to
the
formal
designation
which
you
give
and
decide
whether
the
due
process
clause
applies,
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
applies
and
that
has
caused
some
comment
that
in
fact
mullaney
has
lead
to
a
rather
broad
view
of
what
is
required
to
be
proved
by
the
state
and
might
possibly
lead
to
striking
down
a
number
of
affirmative
defenses.
on
this
appeal
we
claim
we
are
within
the
four
corner
of
mullaney
and
that
this
does
not
reach
to
the
issue
of
other
affirmative
defenses
and
only
the
one
before
us.
new
york,
as
i
said,
does
not
present
the
problem
that
was
presented
by
the
state
of
maine.
new
york
clearly
has
two
crimes
and
clearly
the
provocation
issue
extreme
emotional
disturbance
here
distinguishes
them.
now
what
can
be
the
distinctions?
the
new
york
court
of
appeals;
4-to-3
decision
really
dealt
with
two
separate
approaches
to
distinguishing
patterson
from
mullaney;
one
is
they
look
to
the
state
law
itself
of
maine
and
said
that
maine
first
of
all
really
did
not
require
the
state
to
prove
intent
and
we
say
that
is
simply
not
true
that
the
opinion
of
this
court
to
mullaney
and
the
state
of
maine
cases
indeed
the
brief
of
the
attorney
general
in
maine
make
clear
that
intent
has
to
be
proved
by
the
state
of
maine.
mr.
victor
j.
rubino
malice
had
to
be
proved
by
the
defendant,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
j.
rubino
your
honor,
as
i
understand
mullaney
--
mr.
victor
j.
rubino
yes
and
that
is
true;
this
court
in
mr.
justice
powell’s
opinion
dealt
with
the
concept
of
malice
and
said
that
it
has
two
meanings
in
the
law;
one
is
it
can
be
a
substance
of
element
of
intent
really
just
stand
in
the
place
of
the
word
intent
and
be
proved
by
the
state.
the
other
is,
the
term
was
used
policy
presumption
of
perkins,
who
has
cited
at
that
point,
describes
malice
in
some
cases
as
really
being
a
hollow
concept
that
really
it
is
defined
by
what
it
is
not
rather
than
what
it
is
and
one
of
the
things
it
is
not
is
provocation
and
the
maine
courts
themselves
said
that
malice
and
provocation
are
undistinguishable;
they
are
not
separate
issues.
so
we
have
described
this
as
being
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
the
attorney
general,
in
his
brief
in
mullaney,
argued
that
in
fact
all
malice,
did,
was
to
–
in
essence
triggered
the
provocation
issue
to
be
proved
by
the
defendant.
mr.
victor
j.
rubino
if
the
defendant
put
not
evidence
in
or
if
evidence
of
provocation
did
not
arise
or
in
the
course
of
the
prosecution’s
case
then
there
would
be
no
instruction
at
all
concerning
a
provocation
or
the
ability
to
reduce
to
manslaughter...
mr.
victor
j.
rubino
only
because
--
if
we
are
dealing
with
burden
to
prove,
malice
is
only
relevant
to
the
proof
by
the
state
of
intent
nothing
else.
it
is
simply
--
it
was
described
aptly
by
this
court
in
two
footnotes;
one
as
wholly
unnecessary
and
secondly
as
surplus
in
the
law
because
what
i
have
just
said
about
the
distinctions
in
the
way
malice
is
used
as
a
term
that
it
can
actually
stand
for
something
to
be
proved
or
it
can
be
merely
a
policy
presumption
that
flows
from
proof
of
intent
by
the
state.
as
i
said,
the
attorney
general
argued
this
that
malice
itself
had
no
separate
meaning
in
terms
of
proof
and
we
have
described
this
in
terms
of
proving
malice.
in
maine,
it
is
a
vestigial
organ.
it
simply
is
there;
it
was
described
as
i
said
as
wholly
unnecessary
and
surplus.
provocation
is
the
other
side
of
malice.
the
court
in
mullaney
said
it
would
look
to
the
substance
of
the
law
and
not
the
form.
in
new
york
and
in
maine,
intentional
killing
is
murder
unless
provocation
is
proved
by
persuasion
burden
preponderance
the
evidence
by
the
defendant
and
it
is
this
that
is
the
crucial
distinction
and
it
is
this
that
goes
to
the
violation
of
the
defendant’s
due
process
rights,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
j.
rubino
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
j.
rubino
it
could
be,
yes
is
the
answer.
i
would
argue
separately
on
that.
i
would
argue
that
self-defense
in
the
case
of
unlawfulness
which
is
an
element
of
the
crime.
also
it
is
a
question
of
what
the
other
side
of
malice
is.
perkins
goes
back
and
talks
about
malice
as
being
things
that
it
defined
by
what
it
is
not;
not
justification,
litigation,
or
excuse.
now,
it
is
possible
to
go
back
to
that
view
of
malice
and
say
that
in
fact
where
you
have
a
justification
defense,
self-defense
that
whether
or
not
the
statue
talks
about
it
that
what
in
effect
you
are
asking
the
defendant
to
do,
it
is
to
negate
malice
in
essence.
so
on
self-defense,
my
answers
are
twofold;
i
think
arguably
it
comes
specifically
within
mullaney,
furthermore
i
think
it
might
be
a
stronger
case
under
winship
without
necessary
regard
to
mullaney
because
it
really
goes
to
unlawfulness.
mr.
victor
j.
rubino
i
believe
--
at
least
with
respect
to
self-defense
i
would
argue
that
yes,
your
honor.
finally,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
in
addition
to
saying
that
well
in
maine
all
it
had
to
be,
the
state
did
not
have
to
prove
intent;
we
said
that
that’s
not
just
not
so
and
that
we
have
dealt
with
malice.
the
court
of
appeals
also
said
well,
extreme
emotional
disturbance
is
really
only
mitigation.
now,
this
court
mullaney
dealt
with
that
and
mr.
justice
powell’s
opinion
in
pages
697-698
said
that
the
label
was
not
dispositive
and
that
the
degree
of
criminal
culpability
in
maine
is
not
elsewhere,
at
least
where
murderer
and
manslaughter
involved.
at
least
in
that
situation,
it
was
a
protected
interest
so
that
we
could
--
talking
also
about
degree
of
culpability
involved
in
mullaney
and
involved
here
in
patterson.
the
other
approach
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
one
i
have
discussed
in
answer
to
a
question.
i
would
just
label
it
here
and
that
is
that
the
fact
that
the
formulation
of
new
york’s
provocation
rule
was
broader
and
we
say
it
is
boarder,
requires
a
distinction
from
mullaney
and
we
have
argued
first
of
all
while
it
is
broader
that
is
per
se
no
reason
to
allow
less
reliable
verdict
because
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
is
a
procedural
vehicle
which
goes
to
reliability.
it
is
not
a
reason
to
allow
a
less
reliable
verdict
of
murder
in
new
york
than
in
maine.
also
that
the
difference
is
if
we
look
at
liberal
rules
under
the
heat
of
passion
concept
and
what
the
model
penal
code
revisers
or
what
the
model
penal
code
was
trying
to
do
and
what
new
york
was
trying
to
do,
did
not
make
that
greater
distinction
and
the
distinctions
don’t
create
unnecessary
or
unique
hardship
and
that
if
they
do
there
is
a
less
onerous
means
of
dealing
with
a
hardship
question
and
that
is
to
put
the
production
burden
on
the
defendant.
in
this
case
the
defendant
clearly
made
a
production
burden.
the
issue
was
as
fairly
in
the
case
as
stated
in
the
mullaney.
in
fact,
in
mullaney,
the
defendant
did
not
take
the
stand
to
present
any
witnesses;
the
issue
was
raised
in
his
statement
to
the
police.
so
that
the
production
burden
is
a
less
onerous
means
of
dealing
with
the
possible
hardship
if
indeed
that
is
a
relevant
criteria.
finally,
i
would
like
to
say
the
chief
judge
breitel,
in
a
separate
concurring
opinion,
did
in
a
more
general
way
react
to
mullaney
and
what
he
was
saying
is
that
where
we
have
newer
defenses
and
more
ameliorative
defenses,
we
ought
to
possibly
allow
the
legislature
to
compromise
a
little
bit.
in
order
to
get
a
new
defense
in
or
new
rule
in,
they
should
be
allowed
some
leeway
and
our
answer
is
the
same
that
in
fact
when
we
are
dealing
with
a
procedural
vehicle,
a
neutral
principle
that
goes
to
reliability
that
is
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
that
we
really
should
not
look
to
the
substance
of
the
state
law
that
the
state
should
work
it
out
and
that
they
can
work
it
out.
we
have
shown
in
our
appendix
that
this
has
been
no
bar
at
all
to
the
adoption
of
the
extreme
emotional
distress
view
of
provocation.
in
appendix
a,
we
show
the
states
that
have
done
it;
we
show
that
today
only
new
york
and
connecticut
required
the
burden
only.
defendant,
in
fact,
in
two
of
the
six
counties
in
connecticut
that
is
at
least
at
the
trial
court
has
not
received
appellate
court
is
no
longer
true.
so,
i
would
just
stress
that
this
we
do
try
to
narrow
the
issue
to
provocation
and
that
we
stress
that
we
are
talking
about
a
procedural
vehicle,
a
neutral
principle
that
does
not
ask
about
something
about
extreme
emotional
disturbance;
is
it
good
or
is
it
bad,
is
it
older
or
new,
is
it
more
liberal
or
more
conservative.
we
just
say
should
we
have
to
reliably
have
it
proved
because
otherwise
we
will
have
murder
convictions
in
the
state
of
new
york
that
are
less
reliable
than
in
maine.
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
we
have.
mr.
victor
j.
rubino
yes,
i
would
like
to
point
out
on
this
business
of
intent
in
new
york
and
maine
operates
the
same.
in
new
york,
you
must
prove
intent
and
in
maine,
the
district
attorney
must
prove
intent
that
provocation
factor
does
not
negate
intent
neither
new
york
or
maine.
i
find
it
ironic,
if
you
look
at
the
briefs
in
mullaney,
it
was
the
state
arguing
that
malice
was
really
of
no
meaning
in
that
provocation
distinguishes
punishment
categories.
the
state
said
the
malice
operated
solely
to
trigger
the
provocation
issue.
the
brief
of
the
attorney
general
in
maine
just
says
very
clearly
that
a
specific
subjective
intent
to
kill
is
required
and
so
that
there
are
no
differences
in
the
way
that
the
cases
of
murder
have
to
be
proved
in
either
new
york
or
maine.
finally,
i
would
like
to
stress
that
we
are
not
talking
about
the
substance
of
state
laws
that
we
are
not
saying
that
of
mullaney
or
winship
require
state
to
make
any
particular
facts
or
germane.
just
as
in
leland,
one
other
issue
was
not
to
make
the
irresistible
impulse
test
of
insanity.
we
are
not
trying
to
argue
that
a
state
must
make
a
particular
factor
germane
but
if
it
does
make
that
factor
germane
to
a
distinction
between
murder
and
manslaughter
with
significant
penalty
differentials
and
a
significant
differential
in
stigma
that
was
discussed
in
mullaney
then
it
must
prove
that
fact.
mr.
victor
j.
rubino
i
don’t
think
mullaney
reaches
that
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
an
argument…
mr.
victor
j.
rubino
i
believe
that.
mr.
victor
j.
rubino
if
my
approach
encompasses
it,
it’s
because
i
believe
that
mullaney
encompasses
it,
your
honor.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
for
the
provocation
issue
particularly,
we
don’t
have
to
decide
whether
mullaney
goes
beyond,
it
might.
i
feel
it
does
in
certain
defenses.
i
think
however
that
each
defense
and
each
factor
must
be
looked
at
independently,
just
as
a
question
was
asked
about
self
defense.
there
are
enormous
number
of
issues
this
case
in
preparing
for,
there
is
a
course
in
the
criminal
law
and
one
must
examine
each
concept
for
its
effect
on
stigma,
on
sentencing
differential
and
on
peculiar,
let’s
say,
hardship
of
proof,
whether
or
not
it’s
really
a
policy
defense
like
the
minority
view
of
entrapment
is
and
whether
if
it’s
simply
a
policy
that
we’re
talking
about
whether
that
would
have
to
be
proved
by
the
state.
mr.
victor
j.
rubino
yes,
i
believe
that’s
true.
when
i
said
policy,
i
mean,
i’ll
give
an
example.
in
entrapment,
a
minority
view
says
that
we’re
only
looking
to
police
conduct
and
that
therefore,
it
really
does
not
go
to
whether
the
defendant
was
predisposed,
it
doesn’t
go
to
whether
the
defendant
intentionally
committed
the
crime.
it’s
a
policy
that
we
have
superimposed
and
that
need
not
be
dealt
with
in
the
trial
phase
at
all,
that
could
be
a
pretrial
hearing.
that’s
what
i
meant
by
the
term
“policy”.
there
is
also
an
abandonment,
possibly
a
policy
that
really
what
we
want
to
do
is
encourage
abandonment,
i.e.
really
not
excusing
the
defendant
and
that
you
might
make
a
distinction
depending
on
what
the
state
itself
said
about
abandonment,
not
what
this
court
would
in
anyway
tell
the
state
what
to
do.
