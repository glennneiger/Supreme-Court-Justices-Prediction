unknown
speaker
would
you
distinguish
extreme
emotional
disturbance
from
the
various
ranges
of
mental
disease
or
defects
that
are
within
the
spectrum
of
so
called
insanity.
unknown
speaker
there
is
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
what
is
the
impact
of
the
extreme
emotional
disturbance
on
the
volition
of
the
actor
of
the
defendant?
unknown
speaker
would
you
equate
it
to
the
order
of
vernacular
in
the
heat
of
passion?
unknown
speaker
who
does,
who
said?
unknown
speaker
how
about
malice?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
it
was
an
element
of
the
crime.
unknown
speaker
the
state
never
had
to
prove
it,
never
had
to
prove
it;
it
is
presumed.
unknown
speaker
one
of
the
fact
that
the
malice
was
an
element
of
the
crime,
but
the
state
would
never
have
to
prove
it.
let
us
assume
the
defendant
put
on
no
evidence
whatsoever
and
was
found
guilty
by
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
but
nevertheless
the
malice
would
have
been
presumed
unknown
speaker
mr.
rubino,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
there?
you
suggested
in
your
arguments
that
mullaney
might
--
even
if
mullaney
is
read
very
narrowly,
you
come
within
it
because
you
come
within
the
category
of
provocation
unknown
speaker
would
the
same
argument
applied
to
self-defense,
would
that
be
a
form
of
provocation,
which
logically
mullaney
must
apply
to
if
it
applies
to
your
case?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
are
suggesting
that
probably,
although
i
realize
we
need
not
necessarily
--
probably
the
same
rule
would
apply
both
kinds
of
provocation,
even
though
we
don’t
have
to
do
that
to
decide
your
case.
unknown
speaker
very
well.
mr.
finnerty.
unknown
speaker
in
this
case
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
prosecution
to
prove
intent.
even
if
the
affirmative
defense
had
been
sustained,
the
jury
would
still
have
to
found
intent
to
convict
even
the
manslaughter.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
that
is
intent
to
cause
death
as
well.
unknown
speaker
that
duty
on
the
prosecution
remained
even
if
the
jury
had
found
that
the
defendant
was
under
the
influence
of
extreme
emotional
disturbance.
unknown
speaker
right
but
there
still
would
have
to
exist
that
intention
to
cause
death.
unknown
speaker
since
malice
was
presumed.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
in
new
york,
does
extreme
emotional
distress
--
do
judges
instruct
on
what
bearing
it
does
have
on
intent,
if
any?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
is
the
effect
of
proving
your
extreme
emotional
distress
to
destroy
the
necessary
intent
element?
unknown
speaker
you
were
just
saying
that
as
long
as
a
shift
does
not
take
place,
if
the
defendant
can
exonerate
himself
by
proving
some
facts
that
does
not
violate
winship.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
can
reduce
the
degree
of
the
crime
or
exonerate
yourself
entirely
by
proving
the
fact,
why
isn’t
the
absence
of
that
factor?
the
operative
lay
and
function
the
same
as
making
an
element
of
the
crime.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
maybe
so
but
nevertheless,
the
state
says
if
you
can
prove
'x'
the
degree
of
crime
is
going
to
be
reduced
or
you
are
going
to
be
found
innocent,
you
necessarily
found
innocent
and
therefore,
why
functionally,
isn’t
that
the
same
as
saying
--
why
should
not
the
states
have
to
prove
the
absence
of
facts.
why
does
the
court
make
the
absence
of
facts
an
element
of
the
crime?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
rubino?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
the
same
is
true
about
any
fact
that
determines
whether
there
is
any
crime
at
all
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
you
seemed
to…
unknown
speaker
your
approach
here
seems
to
encompass
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
all
of
criminal
law
represents
state
policy,
isn’t
it?
i
think
it’s
all
policy,
42.18
i
suppose
not
to
have
any
criminal
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
thank
you.
this
case
is
submitted.
