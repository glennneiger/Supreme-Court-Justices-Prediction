here
from

in
new
york,
the

out

proves
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
there
was
a
killing

that
the
actor
intended
to
kill.
the
--
under
the
law,
however,
if
the
defendant
proves
by
proponents
of
the
evidence
that
he
acted
that
he
acted
under
extreme
emotional
distress,
he
is
guilty
only

patterson
was
convicted
of
--
of
a
second
degree
murder
and
his
claim
here
is
that

the

the
due
process
clause
as
construed
and
applied
by
this
court
in
mullaney
against
wilbur
a
few
terms
ago.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
rejected
that
claim
and
we
affirm
that
judgment.
we
distinguish

there
has
been
no
denial
of
rights
under
