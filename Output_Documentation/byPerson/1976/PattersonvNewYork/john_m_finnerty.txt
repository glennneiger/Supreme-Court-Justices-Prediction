mr.
john
m.
finnerty
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
at
the
outset
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
state
of
new
york,
provocation
does
not
have
the
connotations
that
counsel
has
given
it.
i
would
like
to
return
to
that
and
also
point
out
factually
that
this
was
not
in
any
stretch,
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
a
classic
love
triangle
situation.
the
parties
have
been
separated
some
five
to
six
months
before
this
crime
occurred.
the
wife
had
started
an
action
for
divorce
in
the
state
of
new
york
at
that
time
they
have
what
we
called
a
conciliation
proceedings.
a
conciliator
met
with
the
parties
to
decide
that
there
was
no
further
necessity
of
those
proceedings.
the
defendant
himself
had
brought
on
a
counter
claim
for
divorce.
her
attorney
was
really,
at
that
point,
negotiating
a
property
settlement.
in
october,
some
over
two
months
before
the
crime
occurred,
the
wife,
roberta
had
told
the
defendant
that
she
was
going
to
marry
the
deceased
after
their
divorce
became
final.
he
knew
they
were
together.
he
lives
some
200
mile
away
himself.
he
had
seen
them
together
earlier
in
december
and
in
fact
had
assaulted
both
the
deceased
and
his
wife
and
on
other
occasion
her
father.
on
the
day
of
the
murder,
he
came
over
200
miles
stopping
along
the
way
to
see
a
friend
and
borrowed
a
gun
and
that
friend’s
car.
that
was
about
25
miles
away
from
village
of
bath
where
this
occurred.
he
came
to
bath,
attempted
to
borrow
another
gun,
the
first
gun
being
a
22
weapon
introduced
as
the
murder
weapon.
he
attempted
to
borrow
a
shotgun
in
bath.
having
borrowed
that
he
went
out
five
miles
to
his
wife’s
parent’s
house,
drove
by
there
quarter
of
a
mile.
on
december
27th,
it
was
dark
out.
he
saw
the
deceased
car
there.
he
walked
back,
loaded
the
gun
on
the
way
then
looked
in,
came
through
the
back
door,
shot
the
deceased
twice
in
the
head,
attempted
to
choke
his
wife,
did
choke
her.
released
before
she
lost
consciousness,
force
the
wife
without
a
coat
to
take
her
child
or
infant
from
the
house
and
accompany
him
to
the
car.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
provocation
aspect,
if
it
depends
on
this
being
the
classic
love
triangle
of
the
situation,
which
appeared
to
him
at
that
time,
was
not
in
the
case,
the
jury
could
not
have
found
it
because
the
defendant
knew
anything
he
might
have
seen
through
that
window.
now,
in
patterson,
the
court
of
appeals
basically
said,
as
long
as
the
prosecution
must
prove
every
element
of
the
defendant’s
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
specifically
that
he
intended
to
kill
the
victim
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
it
is
not
a
violation
of
due
process
to
require
or
permit,
may
i
say,
the
defendant
to
establish
that
he
formed
that
intent
under
the
influence
of
extreme
emotional
disturbance.
we
do
know
that
in
new
york
the
common-law
developed
differently
and
in
new
york
heat
of
passion,
those
words
was
an
affirmative
element
of
a
form
of
manslaughter
rather
than
a
mitigating
factor
to
a
charge
of
murder.
and
i
think
importantly
in
any
analysis
of
mullaney
is
to
understand
that
in
new
york
since
1829,
as
judge
jason
(ph)
stated,
new
york
has
not
allowed
malice
to
be
implied
in
merely
from
the
fact
of
a
killing.
now,
this
court
and
mullaney
said
the
malice
aforethought
and
heat
of
passion
in
the
maine
statute
were
mutually
inconsistent.
therefore,
i
would
submit
if
malice
is
conclusively
presumed,
which
the
state
of
maine
allowed,
there
could
be
no
heat
of
passion.
this
presumption
means
that
the
prosecution
does
not
have
to
prove
an
element
of
that
crime
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
this
court
in
mullaney
by
requiring
the
prosecution
approve
that
really
prove
the
absence
of
heat
of
passion
is
really
requiring
to
the
prosecution
to
prove
the
presence
of
malice
which
could
no
longer
be
implied.
thus,
winship
or
mullaney
was
a
clear
case
with
the
application
of
winship.
in
new
york,
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
extreme
emotional
disturbance
comes
into
the
case
only
after
all
of
the
elements
of
the
crime
have
been
proved.
specifically,
they
talked
at
great
length
about
the
intent
to
kill.
rather
than
a
situation
pointed
out
that
having
proved
let
us
say
in
maine
conduct
a
sufficient
to
cause
serious
physical
injury.
i
believe
there
was
a
charge
of
that
in
the
mullaney
case
that
would
account
to
manslaughter
in
new
york,
but
in
the
state
of
maine,
given
the
benefit
of
the
presumption
that
would
rise
to
the
level
of
murder.
in
new
york,
the
defendant
is
permitted
to
avail
himself
of
extreme
emotional
disturbance
only
after
all
of
the
elements
that
is
the
attempt
to
cause
a
death
and
the
causing
of
death
have
been
found.
in
a
footnote
in
mullaney,
this
court
speculated
that
since
the
facts
of
intent
are
not
general
elements
of
the
crime
of
felonious
homicide
that
one
generic
category,
instead
they
bear
on
the
appropriate
punishment
category.
under
petitioner’s
argument
that
being
the
state
of
maine,
a
life
sentence
for
any
felonious
homicide
could
have
been
imposed
unless
the
defendant
was
able
to
prove
that
his
act
was
not
intentional
or
criminally
reckless.
i
think
very
importantly
and
not
as
it
has
been
argued
by
appellant
here,
judge
jason
defined,
rather
than
the
model
penal
code
or
the
directors,
he
defined
what
extreme
emotional
disturbance
is
in
new
york
and
he
said
specifically
that
the
purpose
is
to
permit
the
defendant
to
show
that
his
actions
were
caused
by
a
mental
infirmity
not
rising
to
the
level
of
insanity
and
he
continued
speculating
that
there
may
have
been
a
significant
mental
trauma,
which
has
affected
the
defendant’s
mind
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
simmering
in
the
unknowing
subconscious
and
then
coming
to
the
fore.
well,
the
provocation
is
not
in
that
statute.
provocation,
i
would
submit
at
the
same
time
this
statute
was
drafted
came
in
to
the
self-defense
statute
which
the
people
are
required
to
disprove
as
they
are
insanity
in
the
state
of
new
york.
finally…
mr.
john
m.
finnerty
yes,
the
charge
to
the
jury
specifically
stated
that
they
were
not
to
consider
unless
they
had
found,
first
of
all
that
the
defendant
had
informed
and
had
intended
to
cause
the
death
of
john
northrup.
mr.
john
m.
finnerty
yes.
not
intentionally
firing
a
weapon
or
something
like
that
but
the
intent
to
cause
death.
mr.
john
m.
finnerty
i
believe
the
words
of
the
charge,
and
certainly
the
words
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
was
that
his
intention
was
formed
under
the
influence
of
extreme
emotional
disturbance.
mr.
john
m.
finnerty
that
had
to
be
there
first
or
there
was
finding
of
not
guilty.
out
in
the
maine
situation,
let
us
say,
showing
an
intent
to
cause
serious
physical
injury
or
in
maine
it
was
great
bodily
harm.
in
maine,
i
submit
that
that
would
have
been
sufficient
for
the
prosecution
to
convict
of
murder.
here
it
would
only
be…
mr.
john
m.
finnerty
since
malice
was
presumed.
that
would
only
be
approved
sufficient
for
manslaughter
in
the
state
of
new
york
not
with
relation
to
extreme
emotional
disturbance
but
intending
to
cause
the
deceased
serious
physical
injury
and
death
results
rather
than
intent
to
kill.
so,
there
as
conceded,
there
is
a
separate
criminal
structure
all
the
way
down
for
different
crimes
in
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
john
m.
finnerty
i
think
as
judge
mcdonald
did
in
this
case,
if
the
instruction
is
given,
it
must
properly
be
given
that
the
intent
to
kill,
if
you
find
it,
was
formed
well
under
the
influence
of
extreme
emotional
distress
as
it
was
charged
in
this
case.
mr.
john
m.
finnerty
not
at
all
in
new
york
and
i
believe
the
statute
and
certainly
the
majority
in
patterson
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
state
of
new
york
as
specifically
stated
does
not,
intention
carries
all
the
way
through
intention
to
cause
death.
this
court
has
not
held
that
winship
requires
that
any
shifting
of
the
burden
of
proof
violates
due
process
basically
from
the
leland
against
oregon
cited
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
mullaney
and
indeed
in
rivera
against
delaware
decided
recently
for
the
state
of
delaware
does
require
the
defendant
to
bear
the
burden
of
proof
in
an
insanity
case.
one
of
those
in
leland
against
oregon
recited
in
the
court’s
opinion
in
mullaney
and
the
indication
that
it
was
being
undermined
and
specifically
it
was
stated
in
a
concurring
opinion
that
it
was
not.
so
therefore,
if
the
appellant’s
argument
is
that
winship
requires
any
concept
of
shifting
and
i
would
note
that
some
of
the
lower
courts,
at
least
in
new
york,
before
the
patterson
opinion
rather
than
going
further
and
an
analysis
did
decide
that
that
any
shifting
violates
due
process
and
it’s
just
what
winship
was
trying
to
avoid,
i
submit
that
they
are
trying
to
perform
over
substance
because
it
looked
the
same
therefore
a
shifting
in
winship
controls.
mr.
john
m.
finnerty
precisely,
the
mere
fact
of
a
shift
does
not
violate
winship.
mr.
john
m.
finnerty
because
i
think
perhaps
referring
to
a
question
you
asked
earlier,
intent
to
cause
death
and
extreme
emotional
disturbance
are
not
mutually
inconsistent
factors.
mr.
john
m.
finnerty
the
absence
of
facts
is
not
the
element
of
the
crime
but
the
addition
of
facts
changes
the
crime
of
which
the
proof
originally
sustained.
i
see
what
you're
talking
about
were
into
if
any
fact
is
involved
in
a
crime,
the
state
must
prove
or
disprove
it
to
sustain
the
conviction
of
any
crime
but
as
judge
breitel
pointed
out
this,
because
of
the
advances
in
psychiatric
findings
and
testimony,
gives
a
benefit
to
a
defendant
and
since
this
is,
as
the
court
of
appeals
said,
a
mental
infirmity
not
rising
to
the
level
of
insanity,
the
facts
of
that
are
not
related
to
provocation,
they
are
not
objective
things
that
the
jury
can
look
at
what
happened
at
the
time.
they
are
really
something
that’s
in
the
defendant’s
mind.
since
winship
does
not
require
due
process
violated
every
time
there
is
a
shifting,
i
would
submit
to
you
that
mitigation
itself
that
concept
does
not
constitutionally
required.
judge
breitel
spoke
to
this
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
that
and
the
example
might
be
what
reaction
would
a
state
legislature
have
to
make
if
it
were
faced
with
a
choice
between
requiring
the
prosecution
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
fact
which
is
not
required
by
the
due
process
or
eliminating
that
defense
all
together.
i
think
the
aspects
of
the
affirmative
defense
statutes
in
new
york
and
there
are
several
of
them
appended
to
our
brief,
show
that
in
many
cases
the
defendant
possesses
unique
knowledge,
which
the
state
has
decided
to
allow
him
to
use
in
mitigation
of
the
charge
for
which
the
evidence
would
convict
him.
if
mitigation
is
not
constitutionally
required
then
rather
than
violating
the
due
process
clause,
new
york
has
merely
gone
beyond
the
constitution,
beyond
what
is
required
of
the
state
to
do.
it
strikes
me
that
the
appellant’s
argument
is
to
assist
court
to
hold
that
winship
requires
any
shifting
violates
due
process
and
if
that
is
the
case,
we
are
then
into
the
situation
of
what
type
of
scheme;
is
that
the
heat
of
passion
on
certain
provocation
which
was
not
known
in
new
york.
the
penal
law
in
new
york
developed
entirely
different
or
is
it
extreme
emotional
disturbance
in
some
other
form
and
a
mental
infirmity
not
rising
to
the
level
of
insanity.
new
york
has
a
persuasion
burden
but
what
is
then
the
burden
of
production
or
a
persuasion
burden.
appellant
is
really
asking
the
court
to
redraft
the
mitigation
concept,
which
i
believe
the
state
of
new
york
is
trying
to
do
so
to
grant
benefits
to
persons
who
would
otherwise
stand
convicted
of
criminal
offences.
very
briefly,
the
points
made
in
appellant’s
arguments
which
i
will
disagree
with
number
one
is
that
these
two
defenses
are
functionally
the
same;
they
are
not
in
provocation
now
being
a
part
of
self
defense
in
new
york.
it
is
not
the
question
here.
the
question
is
does
winship
require
that
shifting
violates
due
process
and
does
winship
require
that
the
defendant
have
no
benefit
from
mitigation
or
that
the
state
can
require
him
to
bear
a
rather
unique
burden
of
proof
here.
