mr.
paul
t.
bailey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
representing
these
trust
funds
and
here
as
contrasted
to
reference
to
unions
from
time
to
time
because
these
are
jointly
administered
trusts
funds,
four
of
them
are
and
in
that
respect,
they
refer
to
the
health
and
welfare
and
pension,
apprenticeship
and
vacation.
the
fifth
fund,
this
construction
industry
advancement
fund
is
an
employer
administered
fund,
part
of
the
employer
trustdeed
and,
therefore,
it
should
not
be
used
in
connection
with
three
or
two
at
all,
it
is
not
a
taft-hartley
fund.
so,
referenced
to
that
should
not
be
a
referenced
to
the
other
funds,
which
are
jointly
administered.
these
trustees
are
authorized
and
directed
both
by
the
trust
agreement
now
by
federal
law
to
enforce
the
trust
agreements
before
its
collections
and
contributions
that
are
provided
for
in
those
trust
agreements
and
that’s
what
this
action
was
initiated
for.
there
are
really
not
a
great
deal
of
difference
contravention
of
what
counsel
for
petitioner
has
stated
here,
particularly,
in
the
view
of
the
law
because
we
do
agree
that
if
these
trust
agreements
do
permit
contributions
to
be
received
for
the
benefit
of
a
non-signatory
employers/employees
but
that
would
violate
the
302
provisions
of
(c)
(5).
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
yes,
i
say
that…
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
the
contract
that
is
spelled
out
in
the
labor
agreement
establishes
the
trust
agreements
in
each
of
these
instances
and
that
set
up
in
the
working
agreement.
in
the
trust
agreement
themselves,
they
were
very
careful
in
the
drafting
of
it
to
provide
that
they
do
particularly,
do
precisely
what
the
act
and
the
laws
says,
they
should
do.
article
ii
of,
first
speaking
of
the
health
and
welfare,
which
is
in
plaintiff’s
exhibit
iv
and
recited
in
our
brief,
that
section
provides
that
the
purpose
of
the
health
and
welfare
contributions
in
the
funds
established
there,
shall
be
for
the
benefit
of
employees,
of
the
individual
employers,
and
it
goes
on
to
say
sort
of
things.
definition
of
employee
is
spelled
out
in
article
i
of
the
agreement.
article
i
of
each
of
these
agreements
provide
that
the
employee,
whether
union
or
non-union,
is
defined
of
any
employee,
whether
union
or
non-union,
of
an
individual
employer
and
then
he
goes
forward
to
say
what’s
an
individual
employer
by
definition.
that
set
out
in
article
i,
section
5
of
the
trust
agreement.
there,
it
provides
that
the
employer
–
it
defines
an
individual
employer,
as
employer
who
is
required
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
make
contributions
to
the
fund.
now,
in
the
face
of
that,
that’s
precisely
what
we
say
that
the
act
also
requires
that
the
contributions
coming
in
must
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
employees
of
the
contributing
employer.
if
there
is
testimony
in
this
record,
contrary
to
that
or
if
somebody
attempts
to
do
contrary
to
that.
they
also
both
violate
the
law;
they
also
violate
the
trust
find.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
promise?
if
i
understand
your
question,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
yes,
we
are
suing
for
contributions.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
the
promise
to
pay
is
set
forth
initially
in
the
working
agreement
and
it
is
spelled
out
in
the
working
agreement
particularly
and
that
is
also
contained
in
plaintiff’s
exhibit
iv
in
this
record.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
no,
it
is
a
separate
document.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
right,
correct.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
the
promise
comes
from
the
working
agreement
and
the
working
agreement...
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
collective
bargaining
agreement,
right.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
spells
out
frankly
in
the
articles
17,
18,
19,
20
and
21
as
for
each
of
the
five
trusts,
precisely
that
the
trusts
will
be
established.
it
also
spell
out
that
the
contributing
employer
shall
pay
certain
specific
sums
of
money
to
each
of
these
trusts.
now,
in
order
to…
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
well,
the
employees
precisely,
it’s
on
the
hours
that
each
of
these
employees
work
and
if
he
happens
to
subcontract
the
way
that
those
hours
to
some
employer,
who
is
not
also
a
signatory,
then
the
employer,
in
this
case
walsh,
the
petitioner,
is
also
agreed
there
that
he
will
contribute
in
order
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
that
fund
and
he
will
contribute
a
sum
that
would
equal,
the
amount
that
he
would
have
paid
had
they
been
his
employees.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
that’s
what
the
law
says.
we
did
not
say
that,
congress
established
that
so...
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
well,
i
would
not
say
that
he
can
never
benefit,
he
could
not
benefit,
we
state
that
they
could
not
benefit
from
the
particular
contribution
made
at
that
time,
as
counsel
stated,
your
honor,
in
earlier
question
from
the
court
that
if
these
employees
are
eligible,
employers
are
contributing,
employers
either
before
or
after
this
period
that
would
not
by
working
for
a
non-contributing
employer
here
does
not
qualify.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
yes,
i
think
that’s
correct.
i
think
we
are
also
in
certain
instances
these
trust
funds
sue
employers
for
moneys
that
are
in
excess
of
as
an
example,
the
benefit
schedule
has
established.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
the
actuarial
determination
of
the
trust,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
well,
we
have
pointed
out.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
well,
i
don’t
say
that
this
is
true
on
the
basis
that
the…
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
well
i
say,
mr.
justice,
that
the
basis
of
the
actuarial
determinations
of
these
funds
is
premised
upon
the
dollars
paid
then
that
goes
specifically
to
benefits.
they
also
are
actuarial
determinations
on
the
amount
of
overfull.
that’s
the
money
that
comes
in
over
the
amounts
necessary
to
pay
for
contribution,
and
some
of
these
people
never
been
had
at
all.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
that’s
correct.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
that’s
correct
and
that’s
their
obligation
on
both
the
trust
funds
he
said
and
also
recent.
we
are
submitting
that
and
argue
that
the
defense
raised
by
petitioner
herein
unless
the
defense
that
he
raised
initially
below,
but
also
he
is
arguing
that
the
language
of
article
iv
of
the
trust
agreement
has
to
be
determined
to
be
on
behalf
of
or
for
the
benefits
of
these
people.
we
think
that
strains
it,
we
think
that
certainly
attempts
to
modify
the
trust
agreement
which
in
itself
provides
that
the
money
is
coming
into
the
trust
shall
be
used
only
for
the
benefit
of
individual
employees
who
are
signed
up.
we
ask
and
he
has
used
the
phraseology
in
his
briefing,
petitioner
has,
we
ask
that
if
a
person
was
going
to
look
for
benefits,
one
of
these
funds,
he
must
really
look
to
the
trust
agreements
and
not
to
the
working
agreement,
because
the
working
agreement
only
spells
out
what
monies
will
go
into
the
trust.
we
submit
that
the
trust
agreement
in
and
of
itself
is
an
agreement
that
is
legal,
complies
with
the
statute
that
there
is
no
record,
no
evidence
and
no
proof
shown
by
petitioner
whose
obligation
it
is
to
make
that
showing
here
that
any
employee
has
received
benefits
in
violation
of
the
law
or
the
trust
agreement.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
well,
i
would
assume
that
because
it
is
a
document
drafted
in
state
law,
it
would
be
matter
of
construction
of
state
law
unless
there
is
a
federal
question
that
could
properly
operate
on
it.
here
we
think
the
construction
of
--
now,
that’s
where
we
think
we
are
down
to,
we
are
not
disagreeing
with
petitioner
on
the
law
of
the
case
and
that’s
the
302
law,
but
we
do
say
the
construction
of
that
particular
paragraph
or
that
particular
contract
is
a
matter
of
state
law.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
yes,
that’s
what
they
say.
a
comment
that
i
would
make;
additional
comment
if
i
may--
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
i
would
have
to
agree
with
that
that
is
that’s
the
connotation
given
to
it.
we
submit
that
it’s
a
strained
effort
that
the
petitioner
is
making
here
to
say
that
article
iv
does
provide
for
benefits.
we
think…
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
well,
it
could
well
be
that
there
is
some
aspect
of
it.
here
we
are
talking
about
the
construction
of
this
statute.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
well,
more
specifically,
we
are
talking
about
the
construction
of
the
trust
agreement.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
that’s
correct
but
the
defense
that
has
been
raised
through
our
suit
on
a
promise
is
the
defense
that
these
are
contributions
that
would
benefit
people
who
are…
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
that’s
correct.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
that’s
what
we
have
maintained
all
the
way,
that
you
have
to
go
to
the
trust
agreement
to
find
what
benefits--
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
alright,
may
i
address
myself?
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
yes,
that’s
his
claim
and
that’s
what…
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
i
understand
that,
yes.
but
to
reach
that
and
to
make
that
convention,
petitioner
has
to
–
and
we
think
the
wrongfully
has
to
act
or
use
the
language
of
302(c)(6)
as
encompassing
302(c)(5)
of
the
act.
the
act
itself
spells
out
that
under
302(c)(5)
it
must
for
the
exclusive
benefit
of
contributing
employer’s
employees.
when
the
congress
enacted
amendment
by
302(c)(6)
and
added
such
things
as
vacation,
apprenticeship,
things
of
that
nature
which
are
involved
here
and
did
spell
out
in
302(c)(6)
that
the
provisions
of
302(5)(b)
would
likewise
be
the
ones
that
would
apply
and
that’s
the
provisions
that
sets
up
the
trust
agreement
program.
it
did
not
specifically
sort
out
the
requirement
that
it
be
for
the
exclusive
benefit
of
the
employees.
additionally,
when
counsel
in
his
or
when
petitioner
has
referred
to
that
all
five
funds
should
be
treated
the
same
and
using
the
language
of
article
iv
to
say
so,
he
is
saying
there
that
the
construction
industry
advancement
fund
is
also
one
that
goes
to
the
benefit
of
employees.
what
we
say
that
that’s
a
strained
interpretation
of
article
iv
to
get
to
that
point.
basically
there
are
no
specific
benefits
to
employees
at
all
in
the
apprenticeship
and
training;
nor
are
there
any
benefits
that
go
to
anybody
in
the
construction
industry
advancement
fund.
both
of
those
could
not
be
for
the
benefit
of
any
of
these
employees.
thus,
he
has
to
strain
the
language
in
order
to
reach
the
result
that
he
is
urging
that
the
language
in
article
iv
does
say
what
he
says,
isn’t
that
this
is
for
the
benefit
of
employees.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
that’s
great.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
that’s
right,
we
are
suing
on
that
and
we
are
saying
that
in
the
fact
that
his
defense
has
to
rest
on
the
fact
that
the
benefit
payments
for
employees
would
benefit
employees
of
a
non-contributor
and
we
both
agree
that
that
is
unlawful
at
least
as
far
is
the
302(c)(5)
says.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
they
over
this
way
because
in
the
agreement
that
the
general
contractor,
walsh,
who
are
the
petitioner
executed
he
agreed
to
adopt
the
terms
of
the
trust
agreement
as
a
part
of
his
agreement.
so,
he
did
adopt
that.
now,
the
subcontractor
was
no
signatory
at
all,
so
he
did
not.
we
state
that
basically
this
whole
case
has
drop
down
to
one
or
what
are
the
words
for
these
employee’s
contributions
mean.
that’s
the
language
of
the
article
iv
and
we
think
that
it
does
not,
we
submit
that
it
does
not
mean
what
they
petitioner
has
indicated
here
or
urged
on
this
court
or
in
the
court
below,
because
we
do
spell
out
here
that
it
could
not
mean
that
particularly
when
you
get
down
to
apprenticeship
and
the
ciaf
funds.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
if
that
does
say
that
but
we
say
that
it
does
but
let
go
back
to
answer
your
question,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
in
its
opinion
spelled
out
that
first
of
the
urging
before
that
oregon
supreme
court
was
mostly
moglia
and
the
teachings
of
moglia
and
that
of
the
urging
there
was
that
moglia
says
that
you
have
to
have
an
agreement
in
writing
before
you
could
have
benefits.
the
oregon
supreme
court
except
for
moglia
does
not
apply
here,
because
walsh
does
have
an
agreement
therefore
it
could
not
operate.
then
they
came
on
this
petition
here
saying
that,
well
look
because
these
people
cannot
benefit
and
there
is
an
indication
that
they
might
benefit
then
it’s
in
violation
article
iv
and
violation
of
302.
we
say
that
the
trust
agreement,
which
is
the
way
that
you
determine
how
you
are
going
to
have
benefit,
that
trust
agreement
precludes
that
interpretation.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
well,
if
you
use
the
words
--
well
i
am
not
totally
in
agreement
with
it
because
the
oregon...
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
right,
correct.
it’s
not
that
clear
because
the
oregon
court
said
that
they
did
not
really
have
to
reach
that
because
in
the
teachings
of
the
kreindler
v.
clarise
case
and
the
budget
dress
that
an
agreement
that
provided
that
the
contractor
signed
an
agreement
to
pay
for
his
own
employees
plus
contract
employees
under
certain
circumstances
was
alright
because
--
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
that
is
the
dispositive
issue.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
right
and
that
there
is
no
showing
that
there
has
been
anybody
that
has
not
been
entitled
to
receive
benefits
whosoever
received
it.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
that
portion
would
be
--
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
that’s
what
we
say
that
he
has
to
show
that
we
actually
did
payout;
the
trust
actually
payout
some
money
to
somebody
to
--
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
yes,
you
said
that
right.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
well,
we
can
see
certainly
that
the
trusts
are
such
representatives
because
they
are
established
as
a
taft-hartley
trust,
except
that,
except
that
—
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
well,
i
am
saying
i
wanted
to
qualify
my
answer
to
qualification
is
that
of
course
the
ciaf
is
not
such
a
taft-hartley
trust.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
now,
to
bring
ourselves
within
in
the
exceptions,
the
exceptions,
of
course,
rather
that
the
trust
fund
and
we
are
talking
about
the
exceptions
of
(c)(5)
that
the
trust
funds
must
be
such
that
they
do
not
make
contributions
or
benefits
to
persons
other
than
the
employees
of
the
contributing
player.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
well,
council
has
never
challenged
the
validity
of
the
trust
fund
and
no
time
has
he
done
that.
there
has
never
been
any
challenge
to
whether
these
trust
funds
are
unlawful.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
each
of
the
trust
agreements
are
in
the
record,
yes.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
that’s
on
the
pension.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
right,
on
the
pension
he
must
have
12
credits
and
that
means
12
years
of
employment
to
have
certain
hours
per
year.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
that’s
correct.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
the
health
and
welfare
runs
on
a
shorter
period
of
time
and
that
runs
on
a
quarter
saying
that
you
receive
the
credit
of
250
hours
in
a
period
of
three
months.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
that’s
correct.

the
balance
of
the
trust
is
on
the
vacation
for
those
who
are
eligible
of
it.
the
dollars
that
come
in
on
the
vacation
are
allocable
to
an
individual
and
they
are
also
added
to
by
earnings
of
trust
and
the
disposition
is
made
on
pro
rata
base
based
upon
the
amount
of
money
that
comes
in.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
if
he
is
an
employee.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
right.
it
need
to
be
vest.
now,
as
you
wanted
the
other
two
trust
you
asked
about.
on
the
apprenticeship
and
training,
of
course,
there
is
no
benefit
that
applies
to
an
employee
because
the
employee
himself
is
working.
see,
he
is
a
contract
i
mean
he
is
a
journeyman
and
he
is
on
the
job,
so
he
is
not
taking
--
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
he
is
not
around
and
on
the
construction
industry
advancement
there
are
no
beneficiaries
of
that
except
the
general
public
or
what
you
will
because
it
promotes
the
industry.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
alright,
he
would
not
get
credit
for
that
period
because
those
funds
do
not
attach
themselves
to
other
than
employee
of
a
private
employer.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
yes,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
yes,
that’s
what
it
says.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
i
of
course,
cannot
say
precisely
what
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
had
in
its
mind.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
yes,
it
uses
the
word
for
but
if
it
was
applicable
to
the
facts.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
well,
it
could
be
for
the
hours
that
these
employees
work
and
that’s
generally
what
the
reference
means
because
the
word
for
these
employees
under
article
iv
could
not
apply
to
benefits
for
those
people
who
we
just
demonstrated
for
the
apprenticeship
and
the
vacation
over
the
ciaf.
mr.
paul
t.
bailey
that’s
what
i
was
saying
is
that
the
intent
of
the
labor
agreement
was
to
produce
money,
produce
money
to
support
the
trust
funds.
the
intent
and
purpose
of
the
trust
funds
is
to
say
what
to
do
with
that
money,
and
that’s
what
we
are
saying
is
that
you
have
to
look.
if
you
are
going
to
get
benefits,
you
have
to
look
to
the
trust
fund
for
that
purpose.
that
the
only
real
purpose
of
the
contract,
the
labor
agreement
was
to
supply
the
money
and
that
was
the
method
in
which
it
was
supplied.
i
am
closing
by
state
that
we
emphasize
that
there
was
despite
any
testimony
otherwise
and
that
any
testimony
on
this
record
has
the
contravention
of
the
requirements
of
the
both
the
law
and
the
trust
agreements.
there
are
no
circumstances.
it
must
comply
with
the
law,
and
that
there
is
no
proof
in
this
record
that
any
individual
has
received
any
benefits
who
was
not
entitled
to
them
under
the
law
and
we
think
that
that
was
the
matter
of
proof
that
the
petitioner
had
to
make
and
we
say
that
the
decision
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
should
differ.
