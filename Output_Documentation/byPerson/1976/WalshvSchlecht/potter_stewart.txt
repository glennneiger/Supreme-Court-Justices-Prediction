justice
potter
stewart
well,
do
you
agree,
mr.
bailey
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
construed
and
interpreted
the
meaning
in
the
way
suggested
by
mr.
neil
and
nonetheless
decided
in
your
favor.
as
i
understand
it
now,
you
are
submitting
us
that
if
that
construction
is
correct
than
it’s
near
legal
payment.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
oregon
supreme
court
seems
to
interpret
the
documents
here
as
well
the
employees
of
the
sub
were
beneficiaries
of
the
trust
agreement.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it’s
all
not
that
clear
and
i
just
wanted...
justice
potter
stewart
as
you
will
agree
now,
as
i
understand
you,
can
you
tell
me
about,
misunderstand
you
that
you
would
agree
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
did
have
to
reach
that
and
that
indeed
is
the
dispositive
issue
in
this
case,
isn’t
it?
whether
or
not
the
employees
of
the
sub
were
beneficiaries
of
the
trust
agreement?
justice
potter
stewart
but
isn’t
that
the
dispositive
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
you
and
your
brother
agree
on
that
as
i
understand
and
you
agree
as
to
what
the
law
is
as
i
understand.
you
differ
only
as
to
what
the
precise
situation
is
in
this
case,
isn’t
it
that?
