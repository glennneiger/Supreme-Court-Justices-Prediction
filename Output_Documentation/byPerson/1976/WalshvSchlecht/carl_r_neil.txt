mr.
carl
r.
neil
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
interpretation
and
application
of
section
302
of
the
labor
management
relations
act,
1947
as
amended,
popularly
known
as
taft-hartley
act,
in
the
context
of
payments
to
trust
required
by
the
terms
of
a
subcontractor’s
clause
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
this
court
has
asked
to
review
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
rejecting
petitioner’s
defense
that
the
subcontractor’s
clause
conflicts
with
the
requirements
of
section
302
(c)
(5).
the
question
on
which
petitioners
sought
certiorari,
which
was
briefed,
and
decided
among
other
questions
by
the
supreme
court
of
oregon,
is
what
are
the
subcontractor’s
clause
and
requiring
a
signatory
employer
to
make
trust
contributions
on
behalf
of
or
for
the
benefit
of
employees
of
a
non-signatory
subcontractor
violates
the
302
(c)
(5)
requirements.
the
trust
agreements
must
benefit
only
employees
of
contributing
employers.
it
is
apparently
conceded
by
respondents
in
this
court
--
i
read
their
brief
so
to
concede
him
pleasantly,
that
the
subcontractor’s
clause
less
construed
that
is
to
require
contributions
for
the
benefit
over
on
behalf
of
subcontractor’s
employees
would
violate
section
302
(c)
(5).
instead,
respondent’s
brief
as
i
read
it,
raised
three
arguments,
which
were
not
made
below
and
which
now
apparently
are
the
questions
to
be
decided
by
this
court.
i
except
this,
these
are
valid
--
i
don’t
read
a
valid
arguments
but
i
think
they
are
validly
raised
by
the
respondents.
his
questions
are
(1)
they
now
seek
to
have
an
interpretation
of
article
iv
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
subcontractor’s
clause
different
than
that
made
by
the
court
below
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
court
below.
they
say
that
the
clause
should
be
read
to
merely
measure
contributions
to
the
trust
by
the
hours
of
work
of
the
non-signatory
subcontractor’s
employees
and
not
to
require
contributions
for
their
benefit
or
on
their
behalf.
that
is
the
first
argument
they
make.
the
second
is
that
two
of
trusts,
the
apprenticeship
trust
and
the
vacation
trust
are
302
(c)
(6)
trust
in
purpose
and
therefore
not
subsidiary
requirements
of
302
(c)
(5)
concerning
beneficiaries.
third,
they
say
that
one
of
the
trusts
ciaf
or
construction
industry
advancement
fund
trust
is
not
302
trust
at
all.
petitioner,
we
submit,
is
entitled
to
prevail
on
all
of
these
issues
as
well
as
on
the
original
issue.
the
facts
giving
rise
this
is
controversy,
are
these?
mr.
carl
r.
neil
i
believe
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no,
as
i
will,
if
you
might
advantage
argument,
it’s
a
matter
of
supreme
court
of
oregon
but
i
don’t
think
it
is,
i
think
it
is
a
federal
question,
i
think
since
lincoln
mills
of
alabama
that
the
construction
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
in
interstate
congress
has
been
a
matter
of
federal
law.
this
court
might
well
respect
the
interpretation
of
the
supreme
court
of
oregon,
but
i
do
not
think
it
binding
on
this
court.
the
petitioner,
mr.
walsh,
is
a
builder
of
multiple
family
housing
in
portland.
he
formed
a
limited
partnership
of
which
he
became
the
general
partner
to
build
and
operate
a
56
unit
apartment
project
in
salem,
oregon
known
as
oak
hill.
this
project
was
hud
supported,
federally
financed
and
therefore
by
agreements
required
by
hud
the
contractor
and
his
subcontractor’s
was
required
to
adhere
to
the
provision
of
the
davis-bacon
act,
principally
requirement
of
paying
prevailing
wages
including
fringe
benefits
either
to
workmen
on
a
job
or
in
to
trust.
the
limited
partnership
subcontracted,
the
carpentry
framing
work
to
a
non-union
subcontractor,
lloyd
jackson.
walsh,
of
course
and
it
was
bound
by
the
terms
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
a
carpenters
union
that
had
the
subcontractor’s
clause
in
it.
in
addition
to
requiring
walsh
to
pay
if
he
hired
his
own
carpenters,
a
total
of
96
cents
per
hour
into
these
five
trust.
the
subcontractor’s
clause
is
quoted
at
pages
5-6
in
our
brief
and
elsewhere
in
the
briefs
and
it
says
in
general
that
walsh
has
a
signatory
agreement,
shall
either
hire
and
retain
only
union
subcontractors
or
if
he
fails
to
do
so
--
and
these
are
the
crucial
words,
he
shall
“be
liable
for
payment
of
these
employees,
wages,
travel
and
then
it
goes
on
the
list,
contributions
to
these
five
trusts”.
during
the
construction,
the
carpenters
union
find
out
a
course
that
there
was
a
non-union
sub
on
the
job
and
protested
that
mr.
walsh
who
said
that
he
was
bound
by
the
terms
of
the
subcontract
that
he
could
not
discharge
the
non-union
subcontractor.
mr.
walsh,
the
record
shows,
did
cooperate
in
arranging
for
the
non-union
sub
to
meet
with
the
union
people
and
to
negotiate
as
to
whether
they
could
be
organized.
that
was
unsuccessful
but
it
is
agreed
in
the
record
that
mr.
walsh
was
cooperative
in
that
respect.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
i
am
trying
to
make
the
point,
your
honor,
i
guess
that
my
client
is
not
hostile
to
unions.
he
insists
on
his
rights
under
this
clause
but
i
think
that
his
evidence
says
that
he
is
not
unfriendly
toward
unions.
it
is
stipulated
that
the
subcontractor
paid
his
man
directly,
jackson,
a
non-union
subcontractor,
paid
his
man
directly,
the
96
cents
per
hour,
amounting
fringe
benefits,
that
is
an
amount
equal
to
the
trust
contributions
which
would
have
been
required
if
a
union
subcontractor
had
been
employed.
the
oak
hill
project
was…
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no,
i
see
your
question
as
a
good
question.
no,
this
was
paid
from
the
outside;
the
subcontractor
was
made
aware
at
the
beginning
that
this
was
a
davis-bacon
act
job.
there
are
forms
in
evidence
for
his
payroll
and
right
on
the
form
it
says,
are
you
paying
the
fringes
directly
your
man,
are
you
paying
them
to
a
trust?
he
checked
directly
to
his
men
and
it
stipulated
that
he
did
so.
the
oak
hill
project
was
completed
in
november
of
1971
and
year
later
these
suits
were
brought
to
seeking
payment
to
the
trust
by
walsh,
of
the
same
amounts
that
the
subcontractor
had
previously
paid
into
the
trust,
so,
we
say
in
effect
a
double
payment
or
a
second
payment
of
the
same
benefits
or
he
paid
to
already
jackson’s
men
is
being
required
from,
i
think
principal
contractor,
walsh.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no,
we
say
a
double
payment
has
been
required
in
effect
by
the
contractors.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yeah,
the
contractor
had
to
pay
a
fixed
price
to
the
sub,
jackson
before
to
work,
obviously,
from
which
jackson
paid
his
men
the
96
cents
among
other
things.
so,
when
walsh
is
required
to
pay
this
in
order
to
trust
that
he
has
already
paid
the
fixed
price
including
the
fringes
once,
now
you
have
to
pay
them
a
second.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no,
i
do
not
think
that’s
the
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
the
violation
question
is
if
we
construe
an
article
iv
of
the
subcontractor’s
clause
correctly
to
require
contributions
by
walsh
for
the
benefit
of
or
on
behalf
of
the
subcontractor’s
employees.
we
say
this
violates
section
302
(c)
(5),
the
requirement
that
benefits
paid
out
of
those
trusts
under
302,
only
for
the
benefit
of
employees,
of
the
contributing
employer
or
of
other
contributing
employers.
jackson
is
not
one.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
that’s
true,
but
three
of
two
deals
not
only…
mr.
carl
r.
neil
so,
they
how
say.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no,
i
do
not
think
they
are
not
legal
beneficiaries.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
the
statute
is
violated
because
three
or
two
prohibits
either
paying
on
agreement
to
pay.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
article
iv,
we
say,
is
an
agreement
requiring
walsh
to
make
contributions
to
the
trust
for
the
benefit
of
and
we
say
we’d
follow
–-
it
is
an
agreement
that
these
men
should
be
pay
these
benefits.
strongest
case
your
honor,
is
the
vacation
trust
in
that
respect.
the
testimony
in
the
record
is
that
the
vacation
trust
operates
as
in
and
out
payment,
the
employer
pays
into
the
trust
the
money
for
the
vacation
pay
and
that
sum
is
paid
to
the
workmen
for
whose
benefit
it
is
paid
plus
any
earnings,
their
pro
rata
share
of
any
earnings
on
the
sum
paid
into
the
trust.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
there
is
no
evidence
if
they
did,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
i
contend
it
under
article
iv
that
that
is
the
intention
--
i
would
conceive
that
the
trust
agreements
themselves,
which
you
will
see
on
much
more
carefully
drawn
documents
than
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
our
intended
probably
to
restrict
in
the
beneficiaries
to
contributing
employers
with
one
exception.
it
says
in
article
viii
of
the
principal
agreements
that,
although
the
rights
of
the
beneficiaries
and
everyone
else
of
these
trusts
are
defined
or
as
defined
in
the
trust
agreements,
their
terms
are
subject
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
so,
it
leaves
open
it
seems
to
me
individual
collective
bargaining
agreements
to
vary
the
terms
of
the
trust
and
we
contend
that’s
exactly
what
happened
by
article
iv
of
the
subcontractor’s
clause.
we
think
in
effect
that
the
union
got
carried
away
probably
in
article
iv
and
penalizing
and
i
agree
that
the
penalizing
employer,
in
and
of
itself,
is
not
unlawful,
but
we
think
the
union
probably
got
carried
away
in
drafting
article
iv
and
in
a
penally
way
that
they
would
not
cognizant
of
the
requirements
of
section
302
(c)
(5).
we
say
that
our
interpretation
of
article
iv
that
is…
mr.
carl
r.
neil
no,
but
not
your
honor,
though
your
positing
agreement
of
the
type
of
kreindler,
of
budget
dress,
of
greenstein
all
of
which
was
cited
by
the
other
side
and
involved
contracts
in
the
garment
industry
would
said
exactly
that.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes,
i
think
it
is.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
i
know
it
authorize
it
but
i
don’t
think
it
prohibits
it.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
so,
these
three
cases
held
and
i
haven’t
challenged
those,
because
the
requirement
that
we
are
proceeding
on,
says
you
may
not
require
payments
to
a
trust
for
the
benefit
of
people
other
than
employees
of
contributing
employers.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
it
is
not
true,
they
can
never
get
any
benefit.
if
they
in
the
future
would
become
--
well,
i
won’t
say
in
the
future,
if
they,
in
the
past,
had
worked
for
a
contributing
employer,
a
signatory
employer,
they
could
have
qualified
as
the
employee
of
a
contributing
employer
by
past
employment
for
a
signatory
employer,
therefore,
contributions
made
by
walsh
here
for
those
employees,
even
though
their
present
employment
is
by
a
non-signatory
employer
might
not
be
unlawful
under
302
(c)
(5)
and
that
point
is
13.17
on
in
the
brief
of
respondents.
however,
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
these
employees
ever
did
work
for
any
signatory
employer
prior
to
this.
respondent
say
well
people
in
the
construction
industry
move
around
from
employer
to
employer,
from
job
to
job,
that’s
quite
true
but
it
is
rare,
i
submit
that
people
in
the
construction
industry
move
from
union
employers
to
non-union
employers
and
vice
versa.
there
are
either
one
or
the
other
here
in
this
industry,
you're
workman
in
union
membership
or
you're
workman
for
a
non-union
employer.
i
submit
it
to
be
very
unlikely,
you
will
know
the
record
does
not
speak
to
this
that
these
workmen
objects
and
whatever
have
been
employees
of
the
union
employer
prior
this
time,
it’s
conceivable
but
unlike
this.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
possibly,
it’s
clear
that
they
could
not
maintain
an
action
against
the
trust
or
trust
benefits,
that’s
what
moglia
out
of
the
second
circuit
holds
that
and
in
the
old
legal
payment
to
the
trust
does
not
create
a
right
of
the
beneficiary
or
intended
beneficiary
to
sue
the
trust
for
benefits.
so,
probably
the
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
no
because
these
employees
in
this
case
already
received
payment
of
these
benefits.
so,
if
they
were
to
do
that,
they
would
in
effect
missing
a
double
payment.
the
correct
procedure
i
would
think
is
that
we’re
following
which
is
to
setup
a
defense
to
the
contributions
when
sued
for
or
possibly,
we
can
sue
against
the
back
if
we
had
pay
them.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
fairly
not
because
oregon
ruled
on
a
matter
of
equitable
law
in
this
case
and
rejected
our
arguments
along
those
lines.
the
rationale
of
the
oregon
of
supreme
court’s
opinion
is
that
it
does
not
accept
the
moglia
case,
at
least
as
i
read
it.
it
is
saying
that
even
though
you
accept
our
construction
of
article
iv,
that
is
that
the
contributions
are
required
for
the
benefit
of
jackson’s
employees,
that
does
not
violate
302
(c)
(5).
mr.
carl
r.
neil
moglia
is
not
factually
in
point.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
it
is
the
rationale
of
moglia,
i
think
that
we
feel
it’s
applicable
to
this
case,
your
honor.
well,
in
any
event,
the
oregon
supreme
court
seemed
to
think
that
the
language
of
moglia
on
which
we
rely,
it
was
not
to
be
followed.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
the
bargaining
unit
is
the
petitioner
is
not
a
member
of
that
multi-employer
association.
he
has
signed
a
memorandum
agreement,
which
binds
him
to
observe
the
multi-employer
agreement.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
i
don’t
understand
your
question.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
oh,
i
see.
yes,
it
covers,
i
would
say
all
of
the
union
contractors
in
the
area,
how
many
non-union
contractors?
mr.
carl
r.
neil
yes.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
that’s
the
way
it
works.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
the
rationale
of
the
court
in
moglia
says
that
the
laid
down
principle
which
we
quote
in
our
briefs
that
one
of
the
reasons
they
say
why
the
person
seeking
pension
and
as
i
recall
it,
cannot
obtain
one
is
because
his
or
her
employer
never
paid
into
the
trust
at
all
--
or
excuse
me,
did
pay
into
the
trust
but
under
without
a
written
agreement.
therefore,
the
contributions
into
the
trust
were
illegal
and
therefore
had
to
be
put
to
one
side
and
the
court
goes
on
to
make
statements
to
the
effect
that
only
employees
of
employers
who
were
lawfully
contributing
to
the
trust
may
obtain
benefits.
so,
it
seems
to
me
the
rationale
relied
on
by
moglia
is
applicable.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
i
agree,
that’s
true
and
i
think…
mr.
carl
r.
neil
well,
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
way,
your
honor,
because
3
or
2
(c)
prohibits
agreements
to
make
illegal
contributions
as
well
as
illegal
contributions.
it
does
not
just
prohibit
trusts
that
violate
the
statute,
it
also
prohibits
any
kind
of
agreement
to
make
an
illegal
payment
or
to
make
requiring
an
illegal
contribution.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
but
the
testimony
indicates,
your
honor,
i
submit
that
that
isn’t
what
the
parties
thought,
but
that
the
people
who
enforced
this
agreement
on
a
day-to-day
basis
thought
that
these
subcontracts
employees
could
benefit
and
they
thought
that
they
were
announcing
a
principle
that
non-union
people
aren’t
disqualified
by
that
matter
of
fact
from
being
beneficiaries
and
that
is
true.
but
i
don’t
think
that
that
conclusion
falls
at
all
because
it
seems
to
me
that
there
was
every
attempt
in
the
lower
court
and
the
evidence
to
make
these
people
beneficiaries.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
it
does
not
but
i
would
concede
that
he
has
had,
at
times,
employees
for
which
he
must
make
contributions.
he
didn’t
happen
to
have
it
at
the
time
of
his
job,
the
subcontractor’s
--
and
other
times
he
has
that.
i
would
like
to
reserve
rest
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice
for
rebuttal.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
i
have
two
or
three
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
justice
white
extracted
the
concession
from
counsel
that
the
payments
required
under
counsel’s
theory
to
case
for
a
nonunion
signatory
employees
are
not
necessary
to
the
integrity
of
the
trust
fund.
that’s
an
important
point
i
think
because
our
argument
is
made
otherwise
in
the
brief
of
respondents.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
of
any
actuarial
assumptions
of
any
of
the
trust
funds.
furthermore
the
tax
on
pensions
and
pension
planning
cited
by
respondents
do
not
disclose
that
any
such
actuarial
assumptions
are
made.
there
are
a
lot
of
actuarial
assumptions
made
but
they
are
all
made
on
how
many
covered
employees
are
there,
how
many
hours
they
are
going
to
work,
and
this
kind
of
thing.
they
do
not
make
the
kind
of
actuarial
assumptions
that
says
there
is
going
to
be
so
much
penalty
contributions
or
so
many
contributions
they
aren’t
related
to
particular
employees.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
i
don’t
think
so,
but
the
argument….
mr.
carl
r.
neil
i
agree,
but
counsel
my
points
is
--
counsel
suggest
that
the
actuaries
might
have
assumed
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
certain
level
of
penalty
contributions
made
into
the
trust
and
that
may
be
necessary
for
the
soundness
of
the
trust
and
i
am
saying
that’s
not
the
case.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
raised
the
question
i
think
first
of
whether
state
law
might
control
trust
construction.
the
oregon
supreme
court’s
opinion
does
not
directly
construe
the
trust
agreement
except
by
implication
in
its
comments
on
article
iv
and
if
it
can
be
said
that
will
construe
the
trust
agreement,
by
its
comments
in
article
iv,
it
construe
them
in
our
favor.
in
addition
to
the
point
made
by
mr.
justice
white,
the
oregon
supreme
court’s
opinion,
i
draw
your
attention
to
page
34,
the
appendix
to
our
brief
another
portion
of
the
oregon
supreme
court’s
opinion.
in
the
first
full
paragraph
where
they
are
stating
the
questions
as
presented
to
the
oregon
supreme
court
on
this
issue
and
they
say,
defendant’s
first
contention
on
cross
appeal
is
that
the
subcontractor’s
clause
over
the
labor
agreements
violats
29
u.s.c.
section
186,
that’s
302
to
the
extent
that
it
maybe
applied
to
require
defendant
to
make
contributions
to
union
trust
funds
“for
the
benefit
of
employees
other
than
his
own
as
pleaded
in
defendant’s
fifth
affirmative
defense.”
i
suggest
that’s
further
evidence
that
they
thought
they
were
deciding
the
case
below
on
the
basis
of
a
construction
that
article
iv
did
require
that
contributions
for
jacksons
employees.
mr.
carl
r.
neil
it
is
hard
to
tell
your
honor,
this
case
and
this
issue
in
the
trial
court,
we
decide
on
demurrer
and
the
trial
judge
rendered
no
opinion
in
his
decision
on
the
demurrer.
thank
you
very
much.
