unknown
speaker
is
that
a
federal
question
and
all
the
construction
of
article
iv
or
is
that
a
matter
for
the
supreme
court
of
oregon.
unknown
speaker
how
does
that
effect
to
the
central
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
was
that
part
of
their
original
employment?
was
that
under
their
original
employment
or
did
that
come
about
after
the
union
raised?
unknown
speaker
mr.
neil,
i
may
have
misunderstood
what
you
said,
you
said
double
payment
to
the
trust.
unknown
speaker
i
see!
the
first
payment
is
to
the
employee.
unknown
speaker
can
you
say
that’s
a
violation
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
question?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
there
are
no
benefits
being
paid
down
to
the
subs
employee.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
aren’t
beneficiaries
of
the
trust.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
they
legal
or
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
has
the
statute
violated?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
agreement
to
pay.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
did
the
employees
at
the
sub
get
paid
out
of
the
vacation
trust?
unknown
speaker
but
you
contend
under
the
agreement
that
they
will
be?
unknown
speaker
let’s
assume
an
article
iv
was
perfectly
clear
that
the
employer
would
be
required
to
pay
under
the
trust
an
amount
of
money
measured
by
not
only
his
all
employees
but
the
subs
employees
even
if
the
sub
was
not
organized,
the
union
are
not
11.12
and
let's
assume
that
they
expressly
say
that
this
is
an
order
to
encourage
contractors
to
employee
union
subcontractors
and
so
it’s
perfectly
clear
the
intention
was
to
making
pay
twice
if
they
use
a
non-union,
is
that
probably
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
the
question
is
of
course
i
suppose
whether
that
kind
of
a
payment
is
an
authorized
payment
by
an
employer
on
behalf
of
the
union.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
employer
would
authorize
that
kind
of
the
double
payment.
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
forbidden
one,
it
is
a
provision
statement
on
the
behalf
of
the
union.
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
clear
from
what
you
have
said
before
that
you
think
the
employees,
these
employees,
can
never
get
any
benefit.
unknown
speaker
on
the
theory
of
the
section
4
of
the
contract
that
this
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
employees,
do
you
think
the
employees
could
maintain
action
and
equity
to
impress
that
money
with
the
constructive
trust?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
sued
would
be
under
oregon
law
presumably
the
hypothetical
case
i
suggested,
but
if
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
had
no
difficulty
assessing
in
effect
determining
the
double
payments
where
appropriate,
is
there
anything
in
the
law
of
the
equity
doctrine
of
oregon
that
would
preclude
having
the
employees
get
double
benefit.
unknown
speaker
moglia
is
very
distinguished
belong
this
facts.
unknown
speaker
then
the
employer
didn’t
sign
the
agreement.
unknown
speaker
this
is
multi-employer
bargaining
unit?
unknown
speaker
is
he
the
multi-employer
agreement
otherwise
fairly
general
in
the
market.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
cover
most
of
the
contractors.
unknown
speaker
because
in
effect
it’s
an
agreement
--
whoever
signed
the
multi-employer
agreement
and
whoever
agreed
on
the
side
to
observe
it,
the
general
agreement
in
effect
it
will
employ
only
unionized
subcontractors?
unknown
speaker
or
at
least,
these
are
going
to
cost
you.
unknown
speaker
i
must
confess,
i
don’t
understand
the
relevance
of
moglia
at
all
because
that
case,
as
i
remember,
just
dealt
with
whether
or
not
the
employees
can
receive
benefits
in
having
to
do
with
contribution,
did
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
means
that
the
employees
of
the
subcontract
in
this
case
could
not
legally
obtain
benefits
from
this
trust,
that’s
what
that
said.
unknown
speaker
if
that’s
true,
then
as
a
matter
of
law
that
seemed
to
follow
that
the
contributions
could
not
have
been
for
their
benefit,
it
seems
to
me
defeats
your
position.
unknown
speaker
but
the
legality
of
the
payment
turns
on
for
whose
benefit
it
is
and
by
the
matter
of
law
under
moglia,
it
cannot
be
for
the
benefit
of
the
employees
of
the
sub
as
i
think.
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
the
general
ever
had
any
employees
for
whom
if
may
contribute?
unknown
speaker
were
these
payments
for
the
exclusive
benefit
of
employees
of
such
employer?
unknown
speaker
can
you
spell
that
out
for
me,
will
you?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
find
the
obligation
to
--
what
promise
are
you
enforcing
here?
unknown
speaker
why
you
are
suing
for
contributions?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
find
the
promise
to
pay?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
not
in
the
trust
agreement.
unknown
speaker
does
agreement
just
tells
you
what
to
do
with
the
funds
23.18.
unknown
speaker
and
it
also
requires
you
to
sue
for
whatever
payments
that
are
due
to
the
fund.
now,
so
where
is
the
promise?
unknown
speaker
collective
bargaining
agreement?
unknown
speaker
then
it
require
the
employer
that
you
are
suing
here
to
say
(inaudible)
to
measured
by
the
number
of
employees
that
he
has
any
subcontractors.
unknown
speaker
and
even
though,
the
sum
he
is
paying
that
his
contribution
make
it
by
will
never
benefit.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
that
the
fact
is
that
you
are
requiring
those
payments
even
though
they
would
not
be
necessary
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
fund
because
the
people,
those
particular
employees
will
never
benefit.
unknown
speaker
but
the
fact
is,
you
are
suing
for
some
fund
to
go
into
the
trust
that
can
never
be
--
right
now
anyway,
cannot
benefits
the
employees
by
whose
hours
they
are
measured.
unknown
speaker
so,
they
are
really
not
for
the
benefits.
they
are
really
not
necessary
thing
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
fund.
unknown
speaker
because
those
are
the
some
people
but
whose
hours
measure
these
contribution
just
can
never
benefit.
unknown
speaker
wasn’t
that
true
or
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
deny
it’s
true?
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
saying
then
is
this
you
have
to
sue
to
collect
on
behalf
of
monies
or
wages
paid
to
some
employees,
who
can,
themselves,
never
benefit
in
order
to
make
the
fund
actuarially
assigned
sound
for
those
employees
who
can
benefit.
unknown
speaker
just
a
small
point,
mr.
bailey
with
strictly
speaking,
the
trustees
brought
suit
as
third
party
beneficiaries
of
the
labor
contract,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bailey,
do
you
think
that
the
construction
of
the
trust
agreement
is
a
matter
of
state
law
or
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
and
the
oregon
supreme
court
has
construed
it?
unknown
speaker
there
would
be
questions
in
that
if
the
contract
violated
section
302
then
it
would
involve,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
are
there
decisions
in
this
court
that
say
that
the
construction
of
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
this
kind
of
a
lawsuit
is
a
matter
of
a
federal
law;
lucas
flower
and
dowd
box
and
some
of
those?
unknown
speaker
i
would
know
--
yes,
we
were
talking
about
the
construction
of
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
was
a
question
as
i
understood.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bailey,
you
are
doing
on
a
promise
within
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
not
a
trust
fund.
unknown
speaker
the
question
is
whether
the
ca2,
the
comment
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
not
possible.
unknown
speaker
which
in-turn
turns
on
whether
they
are
beneficiaries
within
the
meaning
of
the
trust
agreement.
unknown
speaker
so,
all
of
them
lead
to
the
construction
question
is
one
of
the
trust
instrument
rather
than
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
unknown
speaker
here
the
petitioner’s
claim
is
that
they
attempted,
they
agreed
to
make
contribution
on
behalf
of
employees
of
an
employer
who
would
not
making
a
contribution.
unknown
speaker
that’s
his
claim.
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
the
question
about
the
construing
that
collective
bargaining
agreement.
unknown
speaker
if
there
were
no
article
iv
in
that
collective
bargaining
contract,
there
would
not
be
any
case
here,
was
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
the
genesis
of
everything
in
this
case
springs
from
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
unknown
speaker
neither
the
general
contractor
or
the
subcontractor
were
in
privity
with
the
trust
agreement
in
anyway,
were
they?
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
think
the
oregon
supreme
court
they
actually
reach
that.
unknown
speaker
my
brother
stewart
asked
you,
if
the
proclaim
on
the
face
of
this
(inaudible)
that
the
employer
and
the
union
actually
agreed
and
intended
to
have
these
payment
made
for
the
benefit
of
a
nonunion
subcontractor,
as
i
have
understanding
to
your
answer
that
that
would
be
a
new
legal
contract.
unknown
speaker
you
would
assert
you
will
also
agree,
i
take
it,
but
basically
you
are
dealing
with
a
prohibition
that
is
across
the
border
and
then
there
are
exceptions
to
it
and
i
would
presume
the
burden
is
on
he
wants
to
bring
himself
within
an
exception.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no
i
think
it’s
the
other
one.
unknown
speaker
the
agreement.
what's
the
construction
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
if
the
parties
have
said
it
in
so
many
words
we
--
i
have
a
contractor
terms
to
pay
on
behalf
of
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
employees
of
nonunion
subcontractor
certain
amounts
of
money.
i
think
if
you
agree
that
would
be
a
new
legal
term?
unknown
speaker
do
you
conceive
that
the
basic
language
of
302
is
not
here.
that
it
was
a
payment
to
a
representative
of
any
of
his
employees.
unknown
speaker
then
you
have
to
bring
in
yourself
within
one
of
your
exception,
don’t
you?
unknown
speaker
it
is
one
out
of
the
five,
the
industry
advancement
trust.
unknown
speaker
and
traditional
statutory
constructions
as
of
the
burden
would
be
on
you
to
bring
yourself
within
the
exemption,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bailey,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
unknown
speaker
first
of
all,
is
the
entire
trust
agreement
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
and
is
it
correct
that
an
employee
in
order
to
be
entitled
to
benefits
must
work
a
certain
number
of
years
or
something
like
that
is
their
periods
that
must
elapsed
before
his
rights
vest.
unknown
speaker
on
the
pension?
unknown
speaker
so,
with
respect
to
such
an
employee
there
might
be
contributions
made
for
him
for
five
years
and
then
he
might
decide
to
get
out
of
carpentry
and
go
into
some
other
industry,
he
would
never
be
a
beneficiary
of
that
trust
then.
unknown
speaker
is
that
also
true
of
say
the
other
trust?
unknown
speaker
and
such
a
man
could
perhaps
work
200
hours
and
contributions
be
made
on
account
of
those
200
hours,
but
he
never
get
any
benefit
from
that?
unknown
speaker
now,
is
that
same
principle
applicable
to
all
of
the
trust?
unknown
speaker
but
is
there
immediate
investing
in
the
vacation
cost
as
soon
as
the
man
works
for
few
hours?
unknown
speaker
if
he
is
a
covered
employee.
unknown
speaker
so,
the
beneficiary
is
somebody
entirely
different.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
one
other
question,
i
am
sure
you
would
not
mind.
assume
that
there
were
an
employee
of
the
general
contractor
in
the
past.
he
had
been
in
the
union
perhaps
took
a
withdrawal
card
and
was
not
working
for
the
general
during
the
period
involved
in
this
lawsuit
and
but
he
worked
for
the
sub;
the
nonunion
sub
and
later
he
got
back
into
the
union.
i
take
that
he
would
not
get
credit
or
vesting
for
the
period
he
worked
for
the
nonunion
employer.
unknown
speaker
i
once
attended
the
oregon,
is
it
oregon.
unknown
speaker
the
oregon
supreme
court
describes
that
contract
that
in
this
case
the
requirement
of
the
written
contract
was
satisfied
and
that
the
defendant
admit
he
had
a
written
contract
with
the
union,
which
requires
that
he
make
contributions
to
his
trust
funds
for
his
own
employee
and
also
specifically
provided
if
he
had
engaged
with
some
subcontractor,
if
he
do
any
work
covered
by
the
agreement,
he
would
be
liable
for
payments
into
the
various
trust
funds
for
the
employees
subcontractor?
unknown
speaker
now,
is
that
an
interpretation
of
the
contract
that
they
were
agreeing
to
make
payments
on
behalf
of
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
employees
of
any
subcontracts?
unknown
speaker
considered
any
other
way,
it
sound
like
that
way
if
there
is
any
other
way?
unknown
speaker
what
is
for
me?
unknown
speaker
do
you
really
think
that
these
people
knew
what
they
were
doing;
they
were
not
taking
any
legal
contract?
unknown
speaker
oh,
really
that’s
not
a
business
of
the
statute
or
this
court.
unknown
speaker
the
actuarial
soundness
of
the
trustees.
unknown
speaker
did
the
trial
court
construe
(inaudible)?
