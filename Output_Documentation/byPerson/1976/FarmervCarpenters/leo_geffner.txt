mr.
leo
geffner
chief
justice,
and
if
it
pleases
the
court,
i'd
like
to
start
out
by
apprising
the
court
that
the
basis
of
this
lawsuit
that
was
filed
by
mr.
hill
and
that
was
tried
in
the
state
court
before
a
jury
was,
pure
and
simple,
a
hiring-hall
case.
the
other
elements
--
mr.
leo
geffner
yes,
i
would,
your
honor.
there
were
some
verbal
arguments.
mr.
daley
and
mr.
hill
were
political
allies
and
had
run
against
each
other
in
different
slates
for
union
office.
it
turned
out
both
of
them
were
defeated
in
1968
for
different
offices.
they
were
poker-playing
buddies.
they
had
lots
of
arguments.
but
from
the
beginning,
motions
were
made
before
the
trial
judge
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
case,
from
the
beginning
of
the
opening
argument
of
counsel
to
the
introduction
of
the
first
evidence,
the
first
witness
and
the
first
exhibits
that
the
testimony
and
evidence
should
be
limited
to
exchanges
that
would
constitute
a
tort
in
california
of
intentional
infliction
of
mental
distress
and
not
have
the
jury
try
a
hiring-hall
case
and
that
the
dispatching
procedures
and
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
union
and
how
it
was
governed
and
how
it
was
administered
and
whether
it
was
a
discriminatory
or
nondiscriminatory,
not
only
against
mr.
hill
but
other
carpenters
that
were
involved,
should
be
excluded
from
the
jury.
the
trial
court
denied
these
motions
continuously
throughout
the
trial.
and
over
the
objections
of
myself,
mr.
hobart
introduced
not
only
the
complete
hiring-hall
system,
but
also
introduced
originally
the
fact
that
mr.
hill
had
gone
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
on
one
very
large
construction
project
in
los
angeles,
the
dinwiddie-simpson
job,
and
that
he
had
obtained
a
request
from
the
superintendent;
but
that
mr.
daley
had
not
honored
that
request
and
had
not
referred
him
to
that
job.
mr.
leo
geffner
yes,
there
was.
mr.
leo
geffner
your
honor,
it's
difficult
to
know
exactly
what
the
jury
would
have
done
if
there
had
been
proper
instructions
in
the
case
under
the
common-law
tort.
mr.
leo
geffner
yes,
there
was
a
specific
instruction
that
was
given
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
leo
geffner
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
…
in
our
appendix,
it's
page
60
to
61.
mr.
leo
geffner
that's
volume
i.
mr.
leo
geffner
yes.
no,
i'm
sorry,
page
41,
your
honor.
the
instructions
requested
by
the
defendants
are
at
page
60
and
61,
where
we
requested
the
trial
judge
to
instruct
the
jury
they
are
not
to
try
the
hiring-hall
procedures.
mr.
leo
geffner
the
defendant's
requested
instruction
at
page
60
and
61,
or
page
41?
mr.
leo
geffner
41
was
the
actual
instruction
given,
your
honor.
that
is
the
special
instruction
requested
by
the
plaintiff
and
given
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
your
honor,
there
is
no
such
instruction
that
is
that
explicit.
what
the
instruction
is
on
page
41
is
informing
the
jury
that
there
had
been
a
complaint
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
involving
a
job
dispatch
on
a
dinwiddie-simpson
job,
and
that
--
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
except
for
that
special
instruction
on
page
41;
but,
your
honor,
the
entire
trial
encompassed
the
hiring-hall
procedures
of
local
25.
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
no,
except
that
the
plaintiff
introduced
the
testimony
that
was
held
before
the
national
labor
relations
board,
the
deposition
of
the
superintendent
on
the
dinwiddie-simpson
job,
in
the
state
court.
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
your
honor,
if
that's
the
case,
then
borden
and
perko
would
not
be
applicable.
it
seems
to
us,
your
honor,
that
the
way
this
case
was
tried
and
the
fact
that
it
was
a
hiring-hall
dispatching-procedure
trial
brings
it
clearly
within
8(b)(2)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
leo
geffner
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
geffner
your
honor,
the
basic
distinction
with
lynn
is
that
the
court
first
had
to
make
a
finding
that
the
defamation
in
lynn
did
not
constitute
unfair
labor
practice
as
such
and
was
not
within
the
intent
or
the
encompass
of
congress
to
regulate
that
activity;
that
defamation
as
far
as
the
labor
board
was
concerned
had
to
be
coercive
as
far
as
it
effected
an
organizing
or
a
union
election
campaign.
after
the
court
made
that
determination
that
it
was
not
within
the
scope
of
federal
regulation
or
crux
to
the
center
of
federal
regulation,
then
the
court
said
that
the
defamation
within
a
labor
dispute
would
be
peripheral.
but
then
the
court
went
further,
this
court
went
further
and
still
didn't
apply
the
state
common
law
of
defamation;
this
court
then
applied
a
new
federal
standard
of
defamation
and
held
that
the
state
court,
even
though
it
was
not
preempted,
had
to
make
findings
of
intention
of
acts,
actual
malice,
actual
injury,
which
was
not
the
state
tort
of
defamation
and
went
on
to
caution
the
trial
courts
that
on
punitive
damages
that
there
has
to
be
a
very
careful
regulation,
because
heavy
punitive
damages
could
injure
unions,
small
unions
and
small
employers.
it
works
both
ways.
mr.
leo
geffner
no,
because
in
this
case,
the
entire
case,
the
characterization
of
the
case
must
be
that
it
was
within
the
full
scope
of
federal
regulations
behind
the
hiring
hall.
mr.
leo
geffner
no.
there
were
no
instructions
given
to
anybody.
mr.
leo
geffner
on
instruction,
your
honor?
mr.
leo
geffner
the
question
was,
was
there
an
instruction
on
a
battery?
mr.
leo
geffner
there
was
one
incidence
of
mr.
daley
and
mr.
hill
pushing
each
other
in
front
of
a
door,
and
they
made
them
question,
"well,
let's
go
outside
to
fight."
they
didn’t
take
up
that
invitation.
mr.
leo
geffner
no,
your
honor.
assault
and
battery,
which
is
the
nature
of
violence,
when
the
laburnum
is
a
matter
for
state
regulation.
it's
not
to
encompass
of
the
full
scope
of
federal
regulation
having
to
do
with
employment
discrimination.
we
have
assault
and
battery
suits
all
the
time
involving
union
people,
members
and
nonmembers.
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
your
honor,
that
request
was
made
before
the
trial
court,
that
the
evidence
regarding
employment
discrimination
should
not
be
presented
to
the
jury;
that
it
should
be
limited
to
items
such
as
you
referred
of
a
possible
type
of
shuffling
or
a
battery
or
abuse
and
so
forth,
and
the
jury
could
make
findings
on
those
elements
alone,
which
would
be
the
common-law
tort.
but
--
mr.
leo
geffner
--
the
trial
court
did
not
do
that.
mr.
leo
geffner
no,
your
honor.
if
this
was
a
pure
and
simple
common-law
tort
of
assault
or
a
battery
and
was
done
by
a
union
official,
the
normal
california
common
law
would
apply,
and
also
the
tort
of
intentional
affliction
of
mental
stress
would
apply
as
long
as
it
didn't
involve
employment
discrimination
such
as
this
case,
which
tried
the
hiring
hall
of
local
25,
which
was
within
the
expertise
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
your
honor,
that
presumes
that
there
was
a
finding
that
there
was
discrimination
which
is
at
the
heart
of
the
case,
because
each
of
these
items
of
conduct,
the
complaint
of
mr.
hill
outside
of
the
verbal
discussions
and
that
area,
involved
job
dispatching.
now,
either
that
conduct
was
clearly
prohibited
by
the
act
under
8(b)(2),
under
radio
officers'
case,
and
the
labor
board
then
can
provide
a
full
remedy,
including
orders,
back
pay,
even
an
imposition
of
a
trusteeship
under
local
union’s
hiring
hall,
or
if
it's
not,
then
the
union’s
conduct
was
clearly
permitted
as
a
valid
hiring
hall,
which
is
allowed
by
congress,
as
this
court
has
held
in
teamsters
357
and
by
congress
enacting
8(f).
when
congress
enacted
8(f)
in
1959,
they
said
that
a
nondiscriminatory
hiring
hall
by
a
building
construction-trades
union
was
lawful
and
could
not
constitute
the
basis
of
unfair
labor
practice.
now
--
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
the
jury,
after
reading
all
this
mountain
of
evidence
on
how
this
hiring
hall
operates
against
virtually
hundreds
of
carpenters,
concluded
that
it
was
discriminatory,
gave
mr.
hill
$7,500
in
compensatory
damages
and
then
punished
the
union
by
giving
$175,000
punitive
damages.
now,
the
nlrb
could
very
well
have
found
that,
say,
out
of
these
dozen
or
so
incidents,
that
six
were
prohibited
or
discriminatory
and
granted
release
and
could
have
found
that
six
were
permitted
and
protected
activity
by
the
union
in
operating
a
nondiscriminatory
hiring
hall.
the
jury
in
effect
took
away
this
right
of
the
nlrb,
which
is
the
body
the
congress
gave
this
responsibility
to
determine
whether
there
is
discriminatory
operation
of
a
hiring
hall.
the
jury
made
this
determination,
which
is
what
congress
did
not
intent
a
jury
to
make.
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
if
the
board
has
ever
really
ruled
in
that
area
where
it's
been
taken
on
appeal.
they
normally
take
--
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
that's
true,
your
honor;
but
also
in
garmon,
there
was
a
finding
on
mental
distress
--
that
is,
in
the
board,
rather
--
and
the
cases
are
filled
with
situations
where
there's
a
claim
of
mental
distress.
now,
if
you
separate
employment
discrimination
from
the
other
conduct
that
would
constitute
the
part
of
a
tort,
congress
provides
a
remedy
here,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
geffner
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
is
a
daily
occurrence
in
the
operation
of
any
union
to
function,
including
a
hiring
hall,
is
cursing.
and
if
that
was
the
basis
of
mr.
hill’s
case
and
we
didn't
get
involved
in
the
hiring
procedure
--
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
your
honor,
there
was
--
mr.
leo
geffner
yes.
well,
that
was
a
finding
of
the
jury;
but
the
labor
board
may
have
found
a
totally
opposite
result,
and
they
are
the
expert
body
to
make
this
determination.
mr.
leo
geffner
yes,
and
much
further
than,
that
justice
stewart,
as
the
nlrb
points
out
in
their
amicus
brief,
their
remedies
are
very
broad.
they
can
impose
virtually
a
trusteeship
on
a
local
union’s
hiring
hall,
which
they
have
done.
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
except
mr.
hill
could
have
gone
from
the
first
day
--
mr.
hobart
claims
these
two
rules
of
16
hours
and
going
to
the
bottom
of
the
list.
he
could
have
gone
the
first
day
to
the
labor
board
in
each
instance
and
filed
a
charge.
mr.
leo
geffner
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please,
i'd
like
to
start
this
part
of
the
argument
by
again
stressing
that
the
jury
under
its
instructions
gave
a
general
verdict
after
this
tremendous
volume
of
evidence
regarding
the
operation
of
the
hiring
hall,
and
they're
willing
to
assume
that
the
jury
made
some
findings
regarding
the
administration
of
local
25
hiring
hall,
whether
discriminatory
or
not
discriminatory.
mr.
leo
geffner
because
we
asked
--
well,
for
two
reasons,
justice
white.
one
is
that
a
quick
review
of
the
record,
not
getting
into
a
detail,
indicates
that
the
bulk
of
the
case,
the
mountain
of
evidence,
went
to
the
hiring-hall
procedures,
not
only
as
to
mr.
hill,
but
as
to
the
entire
operation
regarding
virtually
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
carpenters
that
were
utilizing
the
hiring
hall.
secondly,
we
had
requested
throughout
the
trial
and
also
requested
specific
instructions
which
are
contained
in
volume
i
of
the
appendix
at
page
60
and
61,
asking
the
judge
to
give
an
instruction
that
they're
not
to
make
findings
regarding
whether
the
hiring
hall
was
discriminatory
or
not,
that
that
was
a
matter
not
within
their
expertise
province
and
to
limit
their
findings
on
what
would
have
been
the
non-hiring
hall
incidents,
which
would
not
involve
job
discrimination.
mr.
leo
geffner
would
i
be
here?
mr.
leo
geffner
i
think
that
would
again
turn,
justice
white,
on
what
was
the
actual
crux
of
the
case
itself.
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
i
think
you
have
to
go
on
terms
of
what
is
contained
as
far
as
the
board
is
concerned
as
applying
8(a)(3)
involving
employer
discrimination
and
8(b)(2),
which
would
involve
union
discrimination.
i
think
there
that
the
radio
operators'
case
made
it
very
clear
that
the
board
is
charged
with
responsibility
as
to
whether
there
is
union
discrimination
of
employment,
whether
it's
a
union
member
or
non-union
member,
a
good
member
or
a
bad
member.
therefore,
if
the
board
has
the
primary
responsibility
under
8(b)(2),
and
particularly
with
some
of
the
guidelines
set
out
by
congress
in
1959
in
8(f)
to
determine
the
operation
of
a
hiring
hall,
then
we
have
to
look
i
believe
to
whether
the
jury
infringed
on
that
function
of
the
board
so
as
to
create
a
conflict
as
to
the
jury
finding
that
there
was
prohibited
activities
where
the
board
may
or
may
not
have
so
found.
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
it’s
not
just
a
question
of
bad
evidence,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
it
goes
to
the
entire
case
having
to
--
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
the
court
of
appeals
in
california,
in
reviewing
the
testimony
and
reviewing
the
evidence,
found
very
clearly
that
the
…
again,
using
the
phrase
“the
crux
of
the
action”,
the
characterization
of
the
action
had
to
do
with
job
discrimination
and
employment
discrimination,
which
is
covered
by
8(b)(2).
but
i
think
your
question
leads
me
to
another
point,
and
that
is
that
the
question
of
morton
applying
here
in
terms
of
the
state
applying
an
additional
or
a
conflicting
remedy
to
what
congress
has
intended
to
apply.
now,
going
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
wagner
act
in
8(a)(3),
congress
intended
to
charge
the
board
with
responsibilities
regarding
union
discrimination
and
employment,
and
this
court
held
very
early
in
republic
steel
that
punitive
damages
was
not
a
proper
scheme
for
the
board
to
apply
in
terms
of
punishing
an
employer
who
engages
in
discrimination
and
employment
for
union
activities
under
8(a)(3).
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
i
think
what's
clear
from
that
falling
from
morton,
republic
steel
would
have
to
do
with
the
employer
discrimination
and
board
remedies.
morton,
which
followed
in
the
'60s
or
1970,
i
believe
it
was,
morton
held
that
where
congress
has
regulated
an
area
of
labor
management
or
union
member
or
disputes,
i
think
it's
clear
under
8(b)(2),
i
think
it
is
clear
under
the
radio
officers,
and
it
is
essential
at
the
board
of
administration's
regulation
in
union
hiring
halls.
now,
in
morton,
congress
had
provided
a
303
remedy
for
unions
engaging
in
secondary
activities
as
a
violation
of
8(b)(4).
the
state
had
provided
an
additional
remedy
providing
for
punitive
damages,
which
i
think
is
very
close
to
your
question,
for
a
violation
of
state
tort
law
that
had
to
do
with
interference
in
terms
of
secondary
activities
by
a
union,
and
this
court
held
very
clearly
that
where
the
central
focus
of
congressional
regulation
was
given
to
the
board
having
to
do
with
job
discrimination,
employment
discrimination,
whether
it's
an
employer
on
one
side
or
union
on
the
other
side,
that
that
is
a
matter
for
the
particular
expertise
of
the
board
under
their
administrative
procedures,
and
if
congress
said
the
remedy
was,
as
it
did
in
3o3,
to
be
compensatory
damages,
then
the
state
couldn't
superimpose
an
additional
remedy
of
punitive
damages,
because
the
obvious
conflicts
would
then
exist.
the
board
could
find
certain
conduct
was
valid
or
invalid,
provide
its
remedy,
and
yet
a
state
court
could
come
in
and
award
tremendous
punitive
damages
that
could
be
criminal
in
nature
and
could
virtually
bankrupt
an
employer
or
a
union,
and
then
what
is
left
of
the
board’s
regulation?
very
little;
it's
all
been
left
up
to
the
state
in
terms
of
how
it
was
going
to
punish
a
union
or
an
employer.
mr.
leo
geffner
no.
no,
your
honor,
no.
let
me
be
very
clear.
there
is
conduct
that
can
be
performed
by
a
union
official,
just
as
there
can
be
conduct
performed
by
an
employer
representative,
a
superintendent
or
a
foreman.
if
it's
not
within
the
scope
of
the
regulation
of
the
board,
if
it
doesn't
relate
to
union
discrimination
in
jobs
and
employment,
if
it's
conduct
that
is
not
within
the
scope
of
the
board's
regulation,
then
it's
not
preempted.
mr.
leo
geffner
your
honor,
what
this
record
shows
is
that
the
hiring
hall
was
tried
in
its
totality
by
a
jury,
and
we
don't
know.we
don't
know
whether
--
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
we
don't
know
whether
the
conduct
that
mr.
hill
was
complaining
about
--
mr.
leo
geffner
no,
no.
if
there
had
been
an
isolation
of
the
items
that
didn't
involve
the
hiring-hall
operation,
the
administration
of
the
hiring
hall,
which
mr.
hill
could
have
gone
to
the
nlrb
on
the
first
day
and
could
have
gone
for
each
incident
that
came
up
on
to
the
board,
asked
for
relief,
the
board
gave
him
relief
in
one
case
where
he
went;
he
went
a
second
time,
they
dropped
his
charge;
could
have
gone
each
time,
the
board
could
have
issued
broad
orders,
it
could
have
imposed
a
trusteeship,
it
could
have
adversely
run
the
hiring
hall
if
they
so
found
job
discrimination
of
such
a
magnitude.
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
your
honor,
this
is
not
a
question
of
union
power
as
such;
this
is
a
question
of
job-employment
discrimination,
which
has
been
regulated
by
congress.
we're
not
claiming
blanket
immunity
for
anyone
that
is
a
union
officer
or
union
business
agents
such
as
a
…
i'm
sure
there
would
be
this
contention
for
an
employer
representative.
but
this
cuts
both
ways,
because
the
board
does
an
endless
number
of
cases
involving
8(a)(3)
violations
where
there's
been
job
discrimination
by
an
employer
where
the
board
has
provided
the
exclusive
remedy,
where
there's
been
claims
of
mental
distress,
there's
been
claims
for
punitive
damages.
the
board
has
been
dealing
these
problems
since
the
days
of
the
wagner
act.
now,
in
1947,
congress
said,
“board,
you
now
deal
with
employment
discrimination
having
to
do
with
discrimination
by
unions
in
8(b)(2)",
and
it's
clear
that
within
that
regulation
within
the
scope
of
8(b)(2)
is
whether
a
hiring
hall
is
nondiscriminatory
or
not.
to
say
that
all
this
misconduct
occurred
in
terms
of
the
hiring
hall
is
assuming
that
the
jury
was
right
in
its
findings.
the
board
may
have
easily
in
their
deliberations
through
their
expert
administrative
skills,
investigation
and
so
forth
have
found
that
mr.
hill,
as
the
testimony
was
ample
to
justify,
was
rejected
by
employers,
wouldn't
take
certain
jobs,
was
not
discriminated
in
certain
areas.
these
are
matters
that
where
your
court
cannot
assume
that
the
nlrb
would
find
were
discriminatory.
mr.
leo
geffner
there's
a
remedy.
there
is
a
remedy
that
comes
--
mr.
leo
geffner
yes,
that's
correct,
that's
right.
that's
why
it's
not
arguable:
it's
either
prohibited
or
it
is
protected.
it
is
not
an
arguable
case
either
way,
because
the
board
can
and
does
provide
a
broad,
sweeping
remedy
having
to
do
with
job
discrimination,
whether
it's
8(a)(3)
with
the
employers
or
whether
it's
8(b)(2)
with
the
union.
mr.
leo
geffner
yes.
there
was
some
conduct,
of
course.
mr.
leo
geffner
it
was
not
a
question
of
the
evidence,
justice
white,
but
it
was
the
volume
of
the
evidence.
it
was
the
overwhelming
amount
of
evidence
that
related
to
hiring-hall
procedures.
mr.
leo
geffner
yes.
mr.
leo
geffner
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
it
was
the
plaintiff
at
the
beginning
of
the
case,
and
that's
why
we
presented
this
appendix,
who
said,
“we
are
going
to
show
you
how
this
hiring
hall
is
being
operated
in
a
discriminatory
manner”;
and
then
it
was
the
plaintiff
who
then
brought
in
these
various
rules
to
the
hiring
hall;
and
it
was
the
plaintiff
who
then
brought
in
nlrb
notice.
mr.
leo
geffner
if
it
was
a
matter
of
an
expulsion
case,
your
honor,
then
we've
got
the
problem
of
dealing
with
title
i
of
the
landrum-griffin
act,
which
congress
has
set
out
for
those
standards.
mr.
leo
geffner
it
was
not
limited
to
that.
in
fact,
there
was
no
evidence
of
expulsion.
all
the
evidence
related
to
the
first
part
of
that
same
paragraph,
your
honor,
where
it
says
they
control
the
job
dispatching
procedures
and
that
the
plaintiff
would
be
and
that
he
was
given
inferior
assignments
and
be
bypassed
for
work
assignments.
that's
precisely
what
the
board
regulates.
mr.
leo
geffner
yes.
your
honor,
that
is
--
mr.
leo
geffner
yes,
it
was.
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
your
honor,
that
is
not
this
case,
because
--
mr.
leo
geffner
no.
but
that
suit
would
have
been
tried,
your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
under
a
duty
of
fair
representation
as
decided
by
this
court
in
vaca
versus
sipes
and
humphrey
versus
moore,
and
it
would
have
been
determined,
if
it
applied
at
all,
by
the
standards
established
by
this
court
under
federal
standards
what
the
duty
--
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
vaca
versus
sipes
certainly
held
that
it
was
not
preempted.
so
i
assume
he
wouldn't
contend
that
it
would
be
preempted;
but
the
point
is
that
this
was
not
a
duty
of
unfair
representation
case.
it
was
not
pleaded,
it
was
not
tried;
there
were
no
instructions
to
that
effect.
there
was
no
federal
law
applied
at
all.
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
there
would
be
possibly
a
duty
of
fair
representation;
if
there
had
been
an
actual
expulsion,
possibly
there
would
have
been
a
title
i
situation.
but
that
is
simply
not
the
situation
here.
and
what
this
court
will
do
when
it's
faced
with
that
situation
between
a
duty
of
fair
representation
where
there
is
an
application
of
federal
law
which
is
not
preempted
in
a-hiring
hall
situation,
i
think
that's
a
problem.
mr.
leo
geffner
no,
i'm
not
claiming
that
at
all,
your
honor.
i
think
that
under
the
vaca
versus
sipes,
applying
federal
law,
that
very
possibly
there
could
have
been
a
matter
for
federal
law
to
apply,
because
there
obviously
are
two
remedies
on
a
duty
of
fair
representation,
because
vaca
versus
sipes
very
clearly
said
that.
mr.
leo
geffner
on
those
facts,
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
come
under
lynn,
and
in
the
federal
standards
that
have
been
applied
by
this
court
in
labor
management
relationships
as
to
lynn
applying
for
defamation
would
apply.
if
we
were
just
limited
to
a
defamatory
statement
that
was
false,
that
there
was
intentional
and
actual
malice
and
limited
damages.
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
i
think
the
job
opportunities,
the
dispatching
end
of
it
in
terms
of
being
applicable,
would
be
within
the
board’s
scheme
of
regulation;
but
i
think
there
would
be
splits
between
the
two,
because
i
think
a
charge
of
a
criminal
being
false,
under
the
common
law,
it
would
be
defamatory.
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
i
think
under
state
law
in
california,
again,
i
think
we
have
to
apply
the
lynn
standards
as
the
tort
of
defamation.
if
we
did
so,
then
very
likely
there
would
be
a
common-law
tort
of
defamation
as
qualified
by
the
federal
court.
if
the
board
found
that
there
was
intent
to
discriminate
in
a
violation
of
8(b)(2),
then
the
board
obviously
would
proceed
under
an
8(b)(2)
violation.
mr.
leo
geffner
with
the
board?
mr.
leo
geffner
the
issue
of
damages
would
include
loss
of
a
job
if
there
was
such,
if
there
was
proof.
mr.
leo
geffner
i
think
the
normal
damages
would
flow,
yes,
as
it
would
flow
in
a
normal
defamation
case
except
as
qualified
by
this
court
in
cautioning
the
trial
courts
not
to
allow
heavy
punitive
damages
to
penalize
a
small
employer
or
a
union
where
the
feelings
of
local
juries
involving
unions
and
employers
may
be
such
that
it
would
still
infringe
on
the
federal
labor
policy.
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
to
what
extent
the
hiring
hall
could
be
introduced
as
background
or
as
part
of
the
basis
for
the
defamation,
i
think
would
have
to
be
--
i
think
mr.
rehnquist
asked
a
similar
question
--
i
think
that's
something
that
has
to
be
determined
from
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
leo
geffner
no.
no,
i'm
not.
i
am
arguing
that
--
mr.
leo
geffner
i'm
arguing
where
the
crux
of
the
case
where
the
jury
was
able
to
find
that
a
hiring
hall
was
discriminatory
or
nondiscriminatory,
where
that
is
where
the
case
was
tried
and
where
the
board
has
provided
a
remedy
where
8(b)(2)
applies
and
where
thomas
has
stated
that
is
where
it
belongs
with
the
unions
and
with
employers
under
8(a)(3),
that
that
is
when
it
becomes
preempted.
