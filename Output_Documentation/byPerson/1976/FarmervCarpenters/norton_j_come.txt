mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
below
found
that
the
crux
of
the
cause
of
action
which
went
to
the
jury
concerned
hill’s
employment
relations,
and
although
there
was
an
allegation
of
expulsion
in
count
2,
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
expulsion
from
union
membership.
that
finding,
we
submit,
is
amply
supported
in
view
of
not
only
the
allegations
of
the
complaint,
but
hill’s
attorney's
opening
statement
to
the
jury,
in
which
he
made
it
perfectly
clear
on
several
occasions
that
in
order
to
understand
the
cause
of
action,
you'd
have
to
understand
how
the
hiring
hall
operated.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
was
necessary
on
the
cause
of
action
and
the
gravamen
of
it
as
found
by
the
state
court,
namely,
a
case
of
hiring-hall
discrimination.
to
be
sure,
there
were
other
elements
in
the
evidence;
but
the
principle
proof
and
the
gravamen
of
the
cause
of
action
was
hiring-hall
discrimination.
now,
in
garmon,
in
borden
and
most
recently
in
lockridge,
this
court
has
wrestled
with
the
problem
of
when
are
you
going
to
find
preemption,
and
the
key
to
the
test
that
finally
involved
is
the
type
of
conduct
that
the
state
court
lays
hold
off.
is
the
crux
or
the
gravamen
of
the
conduct
the
kind
of
conduct
that
congress
has
made
a
principle
concern
of
the
board's;
and
if
it
has,
the
court
has
found
it
preempted,
it
is
framed
the
test
in
various
ways
whether
it's
arguably
prohibited
or
arguably
protected
or,
as
in
morton,
whether
it
can
be
said
that
the
congress
intended
to
occupy
the
field
with
respect
to
that
type
of
conduct.
so
whether
we
take
petitioner’s
test
or
you
take
a
garmon-lockridge
test,
the
question
as
we
see
it
as
to
the
answer
here
is
whether
or
not
the
court
below
was
right
--
and
we
submit
that
it
was
--
in
concluding
that
taking
this
case
as
it
was
tried
and
went
to
the
jury,
the
jury
was
required
or
could
have
made
a
judgment
with
respect
to
conduct
that
is
central
to
the
board’s
concern
and
could
have
evaluated
that
conduct
differently.
now
…
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
on
this
record,
i
don't
think
you
would
have
had
a
different
result,
because
the
court’s
classification
of
the
conduct
is
a
federal
question,
and
you'd
have
to
look
to
see
what
was
the
proof
that
was
due,
what
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
were,
what
the
proof
was
that
was
adduced,
what
the
instructions
were
that
went
to
the
jury.
and
if
you
look
at
all
of
those
things,
i
submit
that
had
the
california
court
classified
it
differently,
it
would
have
had
to
be
reversed
under
--
unless
this
court
is
prepared
to
overrule
a
long
history
of
preemption
cases
that
start
with
garmon
in
‘59,
go
through
borden
in
‘63,
and
culminate
with
lockridge
in
’71.
and
since
preemption
is
not
a
matter
of
constitutional
principle,
but
of
imputed
statutory
intent,
i
submit
that
the
court
would
not,
absent
a
compelling
reason,
which
we
submit
has
not
been
shown
in
this
case,
want
to
overrule
that
long
line
of
precedent.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
say
that
that
is
so;
however,
i
believe
that
it
is
entitled
to
--
the
court
of
appeals'
characterization
is
entitled
to
considerable
weight.
but
in
this
case,
i
go
beyond
that
to
say
that
it
is
supported
by
all
of
the
factors
and
the
records
that
i
have
alluded
to.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that
garner
is
in
the
mainstream,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
lockridge.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
gonzales
was
preserved
by
garmon.
we
think
that
this
is
not
a
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
was
preserved
by
lockridge.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
am
not
questioning
gonzales.
i
think
that
the
difference
between
gonzales
and
this
case
is
that
gonzales,
the
thrust
of
the
cause
of
action
there
was
wrongful
expulsion
from
the
union.
i
think
that
to
say
that
union
member
relations
are
different
from
union
management
relations
is
an
oversimplification,
because
with
respect
to
part
of
the
field
of
union
member
relations
congress
did
enter
it
with
the
national
labor
relations
act.
it
did
so
insofar
as
it
involved
union
control
over
the
job.
at
the
same
time,
it
preserved
from
the
board’s
purview
that
part
of
union
member
relations
that
involved
internal
union
affairs.
there
was
a
body
of
state
law
that
governed
that.
congress
in
‘47
left
that
the
state
law.
in
‘59
with
landrum-griffin,
it
sought
to
add
to
the
body
of
state
law
by
providing
some
federal
remedies.
but
that
was
the
purely
internal
area.
at
the
same
time
that
it
did
that,
it
recognized
the
continuing
validity
of
preemption
with
respect
to
that
part
of
the
field
that
was
entrusted
to
the
board,
because
although
it
considered
at
that
time
overruling
this
court’s
decision
in
guss
which
created
a
no-man’s
land,
it
made
only
that
very
narrow
insert
into
the
preemption
doctrine
by
enacting
14(c)(1),
but
left
the
preemption
doctrine
untouched
with
respect
to
the
remainder
of
the
field.
so
therefore
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
keep
our
eye
on
what
this
lawsuit
is
about
and
not
what
other
lawsuits
could
be
in
the
future
or
what
plaintiff
could
have
made
this
lawsuit.
and
i
think
the
fact
that
it
is
tried
on
a
tort
theory
rather
than
on
a
labor-relations
theory
only
compounds
the
danger
of
interfering
with
the
federal
regulatory
scheme,
because
at
least
had
labor
relations'
principles
had
applied,
there
could
have
been
some
possibility
that
the
state
court
might
have
evaluated
this
hiring
hall
under
the
same
substantive
principles
that
the
board
would
have
used.
that
would
have
been
bad
enough
because
of
the
possibility
of
conflicting
fact
findings
and
conflicting
remedies;
but
where
the
jury
was
left
to
general
tort
theory,
which
had
no
standard
other
than
what
the
jury
would
determine
was
outrageous.
the
possibility
existed
--
i'm
not
saying
that
this
motivated
the
jury
or
not;
but
we
can't
speculate
when
we're
left
at
sea
like
this
--
that
they
could
have
found
that
even
the
operation
of
a
valid
hiring
hall
which
committed
this
exclusive
control
over
referrals
for
employment
to
a
union
was
outrageous,
despite
the
fact
that
this
court
in
local
357
had
indicated
that
a
hiring
hall
run
by
neutral
criteria
was
perfectly
lawful
under
the
act.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
did
not
save
it,
and
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
nor
is
this
case
saved
by
the
fact
that
it
was
tried
on
a
tort
theory.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct;
but
that
is
at
the
background
after
you
decide
the
statutory
question,
and
it's
in
also
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
but
the
question
of
determining
the
scope
of
preemption
is
a
statutory
matter.
it's
a
matter
of
imputing
the
intent
of
congress,
and
it
is
often
proved
in
this
preemption
area
congress
rarely
speaks
with
…
mr.
norton
j.
come
…
explicitness,
and
you
have
to
infer
it
from
the
scheme
of
the
regulation
and
the
pattern
of
the
regulation.
and
if
there's
one
thing
that
the
board
has
gotten
into
with
both
feet,
as
the
long
list
of
cases
in
the
appendix
that
the
board’s
brief
shows,
it
is
job
discrimination,
particularly
in
the
operation
of
union
referrals
and
union
hiring
halls.
therefore,
we
believe
that
unless
this
court
is
prepared
to
overrule
garmon
and
lockridge
and
borden
--
we
submit
that
no
reason
for
doing
so
has
been
advanced
in
this
case
--
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
