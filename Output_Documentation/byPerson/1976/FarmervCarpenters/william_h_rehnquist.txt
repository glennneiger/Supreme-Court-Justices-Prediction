justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
suppose
for
a
moment
that
it
did.
take
an
unfair-competition
case
that's
filed
in
the
superior
court
of
los
angeles
county,
and
there's
also
evidence
that
would
make
out
an
antitrust
violation.
now,
you
can't
bring
a
private
antitrust
violation
in
the
state
courts.
but
if
the
jury
gets
some
of
that
information
before,
even
if
there
were
instructions
on
an
antitrust
theory,
your
remedy
is
to
go
to
the
california
court
of
appeal
or
supreme
court
of
california,
ask
them
to
reverse
it
and
send
it
back
for
a
new
trial.
your
whole
case
doesn't
turn
into
a
pumpkin
just
because
you've
got
some
bad
evidence
in
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
battery,
you
conceded
was
actionable.
