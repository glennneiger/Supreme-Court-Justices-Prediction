justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
california.
the
petitioner,
a
member
of
the
united
brotherhood
of
carpenters,
brought
suit
in
state
court
against
this
union
and
some
of
its
officials.
he
alleged
discrimination
with
respect
to
job
referrals
in
the
hiring
hall.
he
also
claimed
to
have
been
subjected
to
a
campaign
of
personal
vilification
and
harassment.
in
his
state
tort
action,
a
jury
awarded
petitioner
substantial
damages
on
the
theory
under
california
law
have
intentional
infliction
of
severe
emotional
distress.
the
california
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
concluded
that
a
state
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
entertain
petitioner's
tort
claim.
it
held
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
preempts
this
type
of
suit
brought
by
a
union
member
against
the
union
and
its
officials.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
disagree
with
the
california
court
of
appeals.
we
do
not
think
federal
labor
law
has
preempted
all
tort
claims
under
state
law.
the
opportunity
for
interference
with
the
federal
scheme
of
regulation
is
not
sufficient
in
a
case
of
this
kind
to
conclude
that
congress
intended
to
vest
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
labor
board.
in
this
case
however,
we
do
not
reinstate
the
jury
verdict.
we
think
the
way
in
which
this
case
was
tried
and
particularly,
the
instructions
to
the
jury
did
impose
a
risk
of
undue
interference
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
we
therefore
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
our
opinion.
