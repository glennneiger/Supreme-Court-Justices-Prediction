mr.
g.
dana
hobart
thank
you,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
is
here
hoping
to
reverse
the
appellant
decision
of
california,
which
took
away
from
richard
t.
hill
a
judgment
amounting
$182,500.
i
think
it
will
be
helpful
to
the
court
to
have
perhaps
a
little
more
of
a
sketch
with
respect
to
some
of
the
facts
that
the
evidence
adduced
at
trial.
richard
hill
had
been
a
member
of
local
25
for
a
good
number
of
years
prior
to
the
lawsuit.
he
had
held
many
offices,
and
he
had
held
offices
with
the
los
angeles
district
council
of
carpenters,
with
which
local
25
is
affiliated.
in
1965,
mr.
hill
was
elected
to
a
three-year
term
as
vice-president
of
the
office.
switch
for
a
moment
now
to
mr.
e.
g.
daley,
known
affectionately
among
union
members
as
"blackie"
daley.
mr.
daley
was
the
chief
business
agent
of
the
union.
for
all
practical
purposes,
he
controlled
the
affairs
of
the
union.
he
dominated
the
executive
board,
and
he
dominated
the
various
governing
boards
of
the
union.
when
mr.
hill
became
a
member
of
the
executive
board,
he
after
some
period
of
time
began
developing
a
series
of
conflicts
with
mr.
daley.
he
opposed
mr.
daley
in
many
of
the
matters
which
were
presented
before
the
executive
board.
in
retaliation
for
that
conduct,
at
least
at
the
beginning,
mr.
daley
entered
upon
a
series
of
vituperative
acts
directed
toward
mr.
hill
and
which
in
our
complaint
below
we
alleged
created
intentionally
severe
emotional
distress.
when
the
acrimonious
situation
reached
its
peak
toward
the
very
end
of
1966,
mr.
daley
threatened
mr.
hill
on
numerous
occasions
with
words
generally
to
the
effect,
"either
you
go
along
with
me
in
the
executive
board
and
the
votes
of
this
organization
and
quit
criticizing
me
for
such
things
as
misuse
of
union
funds",
which
was
one
of
the
criticisms,
"or
i'm
going
to
starve
you
out
of
this
local.
you
will
not
work
until
you
join
the
crowd".
mr.
daley
promised
this,
and
he
carried
it
out.
mr.
hill,
on
the
other
hand,
perhaps
unfortunately,
was
not
intimidated
by
this
conduct
and
continued
to
oppose
mr.
daley.
now,
this
gives
rise
to
a
series
of
events.
mr.
hill
was
the
victim
of
incredible
ridicule
in
front
of
his
peers.
he
would
be
walking
or
standing
around
the
union
hall
with
his
friends.
union
officials
would
come
up
to
the
friends
and
tell
them,
“you
better
not
be
seen
with
mr.
hill,
or
you're
going
to
get
the
same
treatment
mr.
hill
gets,"
which
was
in
a
sense
starvation,
insults
and
so
forth.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
it
does,
your
honor.
yes,
it
is
in
the
record.
everything
i've
said
is
in
the
record
and
is
evidence
in
the
case,
absolutely.
at
any
rate,
the
discrimination
took
many
forms;
but
the
form
with
which
we're
most
concerned
here,
i
believe,
is
the
discrimination
in
the
hiring
hall,
and
the
court
should
fully
appreciate
two
or
three
concepts
related
to
the
hiring
hall.
the
hiring
hall
concept
of
local
25
was
something
that
was
provided
for
in
the
labor-management
agreements.
the
union
negotiated
with
management,
and
part
of
that
management
agreement
was
the
hiring
hall.
men
signed
the
bottom
of
the
list
when
they
came
from
unemployment
for
employment,
signed
the
bottom
of
the
list
and
eventually
worked
their
way
up.
the
list
many
times
totaled
5,
10,
15,
even
20
pages,
depending
on
how
economic
times
were.
two
important
rules
with
respect
to
the
hiring
hall.
one
rule
is
that
if
a
man
works
16
hours,
he
is
by
virtue
of
having
accepted
that
employment
no
longer
eligible
to
come
back
to
the
top
of
the
list;
even
though
there
may
be
jobs
of
months'
duration,
he
must
start
again
at
the
bottom.
this
was
one
of
the
tools
that
was
used
to
discriminate
against
mr.
hill.
the
other,
in
addition
to
the
16-hour
rule,
is
the
refusal
rule.
under
the
local
policy
of
the
union,
you
could
refuse
two
jobs.
if
they
were
in
the
area
that
you
had
qualified
yourself,
two
refusals
would
constitute
grounds
for
removing
you
to
the
bottom
of
the
list.
but
you
had
the
absolute
right
of
qualifying
your
own
self;
in
other
words,
as
mr.
hill
said,
“i
can't
handle
steel
form
work.”
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
oh,
no.
no,
no,
the
hiring
hall
was
absolutely
legal.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
absolutely,
absolutely.
it
was
merely
the
administration
of
it
internally
within
the
union
that
we
complain
about.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
agree.
it
goes
to
a
lot
of
issues,
which
we'll
undoubtedly
cover
and
which
we
have
covered
in
our
brief.
the
...
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
absolutely,
your
honor.
the
problem
is,
are
we
now
relegated
to
ascertaining
the
intent
of
blackie
daley
at
each
step
of
the
way?
do
we
say
now
it
is
personal,
or
is
it
still
political?
it
would
be
impossible
to
ascertain
that.
i
recognize
they
make
the
contention,
but
i
think
it
is
a
meritless
contention.
let
me
summarize
for
a
moment
now
what
happened
in
the
next
year-and-a-half
after
this
conflict
developed
into
a
full-blown
war
between
the
two
people.
january
9th,
1967,
mr.
hill
signed
the
out-of-work
list
at
the
bottom
of
the
list.
he'd
come
off
of
a
job
recently.
by
march
20th
of
1967,
he
had
reached
page
2
on
the
out-of-work
list,
which
for
all
purposes
is
considered
high
on
the
list,
very
high,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
now,
on
that
time
when
mr.
hill
had
reached
the
status,
a
high
status
where
hopefully
he
would
go
out
and
get
a
job
of
some
duration,
he
was
offered
a
steel
form
job.
mr.
hill
was
a
52-year-old
man
who
had
a
herniated
lumbar
disk;
he
was
deaf
in
one
ear.
he
had
never
qualified
himself
for
steel
form
work,
and
the
testimony
was
it
took
young
men
to
do
that.
it
was
hard
work.
in
fact,
testimony
in
the
trial
was,
it
was
undesirable
work,
which
a
good
carpenter
would
never
seek.
he
was
not
qualified
and
not
registered
for
it,
but
they
offered
it
to
him
anyway.
they
said,
“here
is
a
steel
form
job.”
he
says,
"i
can't
take
that."
they
marked
it
as
a
refusal,
even
though
it
was
a
permissible
refusal
not
markable.
but
what
mr.
daley
did
at
that
point
was
telephone
the
department
of
employment,
and
he
told
the
department
of
employment
that
mr.
hill
is
not
eligible
for
his
benefits,
which
he
was
living
off
of
during
this
period
of
unemployment,
because
he
had
refused
a
job.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
that's
right,
your
honor,
in
the
state
department
of
employment.
he
interfered
with
it.
well,
they
had
a
hearing
and
deleted
something
three,
four
or
five
weeks.
he
finally
got
his
check,
because
he
was
not
qualified
for
the
work,
he
did
not
turn
down
a
legitimate
request;
but
it
delayed
him
in
getting
his
money,
on
which
he
was
depending
for
survival.
all
right,
then,
your
honor,
11
days
later
on
march
21st,
mr.
daley
fabricated
--
we
proved
in
court,
we
demonstrated
that
he
fabricated
a
dispatch
slip
that
was
never
handed
to
mr.
hill,
and
with
that
dispatch
ship
he
took
the
out-of-work
list,
wrote
"refused",
indicating
that
mr.
hill
had
refused
the
phony
dispatch
slip,
and
now
mr.
hill,
he
said,
you
have
two
refusals.
you
violated
the
rule.
mr.
hill
goes
from
page
2
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
list.
well,
this
caused
mr.
hill
a
great
deal
of
anxiety.
mr.
hill
was
hospitalized
three
days
later.
that
activity
occurred
about
the
31st
of
march;
on
april
2nd,
he
went
to
the
hospital
for
ten
days
as
a
destroyed
man
internally.
they
checked
him,
and
there
was
nothing
organically
wrong
with
mr.
hill.
a
month
later,
he
was
back
signing
the
out-of-work
list
on
may
1,
1967.
now,
he
signs
and
he
also
attempts
to
solicit
for
himself
a
job,
which
is
completely
permissible
under
the
rules
of
the
union.the
evidence
is
overwhelming
in
that
respect.he
goes
to
a
project
called
the
dinwiddie-simpson
project,
and
he
says
to
mr.
simpson,
“may
i
have
a
job?"
mr.
simpson
says,
“yes,
i'm
going
to
hire
you
tomorrow.
we're
sending
in
a
request
for
four
men,
you'll
be
on
that
list.”
and
on
that
night,
they
telephone
in
the
list
to
the
union,
and
when
mr.
hill
shows
up
the
next
morning
expecting
to
be
dispatched,
mr.
daley
says,
“go
to,
and
your
honor
is
nowhere.
and
you're
not
getting
a
dispatch
out
of
here,
i
don't
care
who
asks
for
you”,
and
consequently
mr.
hill
did
not
get
the
dispatch.
well,
two
things
occurred
as
a
result
of
the
refusal
to
honor
a
legitimate
union
request.
one,
mr.
hill
went
on
disability
again.
he
was
totally
destroyed
by
this
conduct,
which
had
preceded
it
and
now
which
was
capped
by
this.
additionally,
over
this
one
incident
--
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
yes,
your
honor,
he
was
vice-president
of
the
union.
over
this
one
incident,
mr.
hill
filed
charges
with
the
national
labor
relations
board,
claiming
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
that
the
union
interfered,
your
honor,
with
an
attempt
by
an
employer
to
hire
him.
i
think
it
was
an
8-,
maybe
-2
complaint
under
the
nlra,
and
the
charge
eventually
was
sustained
in
the
nlr.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
no,
your
honor,
we
don't
claim
that
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
well,
it
depends
on
how
you
interpret
"arguably";
it
depends
on
what
"arguably"
really
means;
what
it
meant
then
under
the
'59
decision
of
garmon.
our
position
is,
we
think
we
have
demonstrated
in
our
briefs
and,
as
your
honors
know
full
well,
that
this
issue
has
been
explored
in
great
detail
in
this
case
and
you've
explored
it
before
in
other
cases.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
your
honor,
a
determination
of
that
issue,
i
do
not
think
is
essential;
but
to
answer
the
question,
i
think
the
law
is
if
we
properly
interpret
congressional
intent
from
1947
that
the
law
is,
yes,
that
action
could
be
maintainable,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
all
the
complaints
are
--
all
the
claims
are,
no,
it
can't,
because
it
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
actually
or
arguably.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
yes.
i
don't
know
of
any
rule
that
would
preclude
this
double
path.
i
am
unaware
of
any
that
would
you
can't
do
it.
you
probably
wouldn’t
do
it
as
a
practical
matter.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
well,
the
problem
with
garmon
is
that
you
--
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
as
your
honor
is
aware,
the
garmon
case
was
only
considered
in
the
context
of
union-versus-employer
disputes.
there
was
no
union
versus
member.
there
was
no
intra-union
dispute
in
that
case,
and
the
language
of
garmon
clearly
indicates
that
there
was
no
intent
that
that
rule
of
garmon
and
principle
of
garmon
was
intended
to
carry
into
labor
or
intra-union
disputes,
and
this
is
what
the
problem
has
become.
your
honor
will
recall
in
garmon,
the
definition
of
"arguably",
which
has
become
the
term
that
has
caused
or
inflicted
so
much
trouble
in
this
field
is
the
arguable
term.
it
was
defined
there
as
the
following:
"when
it
is
clear
or
may
be
fairly
assumed".
and
mr.
justice
harlan
in
his
concurring
opinion
termed
it
as
"fairly
debatable".
well,
then
subsequent
decisions
around
the
country
have
led
to
an
abuse,
a
gross
abuse
of
the
term
"arguable".
everything
is
arguable.
lawyers,
if
no
one
else
lawyers,
can
make
an
argument.
i
can
make
an
argument,
for
example,
that
the
decision
that
the
judgment
below
affects
the
washington
red
skins.
it
is
arguable
that
it
kept
somebody
a
couple
of
dollars
out
of
his
pockets
so
he
couldn't
take
the
airplane
back
to
washington,
d.c.
to
buy
the
ticket,
and
arguably
he
stayed
home
because
of
that;
patently
absurd,
of
course,
but
arguable.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
no,
your
honor;
he
said
the
garmon
case.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
that’s
correct.
what
happened
was,
in
borden,
eventually
the
arguable
concept
--
this
was,
what,
1963,
four
years
later
--
the
arguable
concept
had
been
spilled
over
into
the
relations
of
members
of
unions
and
the
internal
conduct.
it
was
never
a
part
of
congressional
intent
that
this
kind
of
conduct
be
governed
by
the
labor
management
relations
act
to
begin
with.
yes,
borden
does
take
the
position
they
say
the
one
incident,
which
is
similar
to
the
one
incident
that
we've
talked
about
here;
but
in
our
situation,
that
one
incident
is
merely
one
of
a
number
of
incidents.
it's
an
isolated
incident.
it's
been
leaped
upon
by
the
other
interested
parties
as
to
saying
that
is
the
correction
of
the
case,
to
come
to
gonzales,
for
example.
and
so
in
borden,
this
arguable
context
slopped
over.
it
was
now
applied
to
relations
that
to
some
extent
affected
intra-union
--
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
well,
your
honor,
it
violated
the
general
laws
toward
the
laws
of
california
only
in
that
the
intentional
infliction
of
severe
emotional
distress
is
a
tort
in
california.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
under
california
law?
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
well,
under
federal
law,
yes.
for
example,
the
--
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
that
was
all.
no,
that
was
all
we
had
to
establish:
was
a
tort
inflicted.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
the
conduct
which
was
levied
at
mr.
hill,
had
to
be
such
outrageous,
egregious
conduct
that
was
beyond
the
bounds
of
what
ordinary
in
and
society
should
have
to
put
up
with.
it
was
also
defined
in
the
instructions
to
the
jury
that
it
did
not
include
the
trivialities
of
life
and
the
regular,
ordinary
problems
with
which
we
are
faced
from
time
to
time;
but
it
had
to
be
severe,
and
it
had
to
be
intentionally
inflicted.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
and
it
had
to
be
sustained,
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
no,
it
did
not
have
to
be
illegal,
and
otherwise
it
was
not
other
than
it
violates
the
general
concept
toward
law.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
yes,
your
honor,
it
certainly
is.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
yes.
no
such
affirmative
defense
was
presented
from
this
case
…
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
…
but
conceivably
you
could
come
up
with
something
to
that.
but
it
was
a
general
law
and
not
a
specific
foundation.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
absolutely.
he
would
have
a
right
to
a
cause
of
action.
if
you
took
all
of
the
job
discrimination
of
this
case
and
you
set
it
aside
and
you
took
simply
the
personal
relationships
that
went
on
between
these
two
men
--
i
say
"between";
it
was
a
give
and
take,
not
both
ways.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
yes,
i
do
think
it
would
be
similar
to
an
intentional
and
egregious
libel.
something
like
the
lynn
case,
for
example,
would
be
along
those
categories
where
they
--
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
your
honor,
it
does
not.
and,
you
see,
that's
the
problem;
that
really
is
the
problem.
if
you
assume
that
congress
intended
at
the
beginning
that
these
internal
disputes
were
to
be
preempted
through
the
provisions
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
all
relegated
to
the
nlrb,
you
would
make
absolutely
no
progress
in
controlling
the
type
of
behavior
that
we
have.
i
don't
think
there
are
very
many
union
people,
union
leaders,
who
are
tyrants;
but
i
know
there
are
some.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
not
illegally
administered;
discriminatorily
administered.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
well,
only
on
one
incident.
you
see,
mr.
hill
--
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
that's
an
interesting
argument,
and
it
is
raised
by
the
defense
in
the
case;
but
the
problem
is
this:
much
of
the
conduct
--
for
example,
i
mentioned
to
you
the
fabrication
of
the
dispatch
letter
--
that
was
not
even
known
until
we
had
rested
our
case.
i
was
sitting
at
the
bench.
i
was
looking
through
all
this
papers
and
i
noticed,
"my
god,
this
thing
has
a
wrong
number
on
it,
the
wrong
starting
letter".
i
realized
then
what
had
happened,
because
mr.
hill
had
told
me;
he
said,
"well,
i
don't
know
anything
about
that".
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
well,
they
never
encountered
each
other,
your
honor,
basically
outside
of
either
the
union
or
in
halls
and
places
around.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
oh,
well,
everything
he
did
was
--
most
everything
was
not
directly
connected
with
the
activities
of
the
union,
or
at
least
the
legitimate
activities
of
the
union.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
well,
when
you
call
a
man
“son
of
a
bitch”,
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
not
related
to
union
activity.
when
he
--
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
i
have,
your
honor,
i
have
been
for
years
a
union
member,
and
i
represent
labor
unions
in
los
angeles.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
i've
heard
the
phrase;
but
i
know,
your
honor,
that
there
are
two
ways
to
present
the
phrase.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
that
is
an
arguable
position
that
i
don't
take
any
great
quarrel
with,
your
honor;
but
the
question
is,
so
what?
isn't
the
question,
then,
is
it
controlled
by
the
labor
management
relations
act,
or
isn't
it?
you
see,
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
lmra
to
determine
the
intent.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
the
question
states
the
truth,
your
honor.
mr.
hill’s
conduct
regarding
the
nlrb
incident
occurred
in
may
of
1967.
the
lawsuit
was
filed
in
april
of
1969,
two
years
later.
so
in
spite
of
the
pendency
of
this
case
and
the
decision
of
the
nlrb,
it
did
nothing
to
deter
mr.
daley.
it
did
not
interfere
with
his
hostile
conduct
at
all.
the
problem
is,
mr.
daley
knows
that
the
most
the
board
is
going
to
do
is
say,
“cease
and
desist,
mr.
daley”.
mr.
daley
is
not
a
gentleman,
was
not
a
gentleman.
he
was
a
tyrant,
and
he
was
not
dissuaded
by
the
cease-and-desist
order,
which
--
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
the
$2500
was
for
loss
of
earnings
and
loss
of
earnings
only.
that's
one
of
the
important
points
of
the
case,
your
honor.
in
the
briefs
of
the
defense,
they
made
a
point
by
saying
that
this
case
is
borden
because
of
the
one
incident;
and
then
they
went
on
to
say
that
we
tried
some
bootstraps
argument
by
having
the
jury
instructed
on
the
fact
that
mr.
hill
had
received
a
$2500
award.
now,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
this:
that
jury
did
not
know
that
there
was
such
an
award
until
opposing
counsel,
mr.
geffner,
until
mr.
geffner
gave
that
jury
that
information
in
the
form
of
a
question.
on
the
report
of
transcript
at
page
2684,
mr.
geffner
asked
the
following
question
to
mr.
hill:
"didn't
you
receive
a
payment
from
local
25
of
$2517.27?"
to
which
mr.
hill
responded,
"yes."
mr.
geffner
then
introduced
into
evidence
a
copy
of
the
check
itself.
this
was
a
tactical
move
on
their
part
to
try
to
get
that
jury
to
think
that,
well,
mr.
hill's
already
been
compensated
anyway;
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
giving
him
any
more.
and
i
even
approached
the
bench
and
in
a
bench
conference
said,
“your
honor,
i
was
under
the
impression
that
this
was
improper",
because
i
thought
it
was
prejudicial
error
to
have
that
kind
of
information
before
the
jury.
and
so
when
i
asked
for
that
jury
instruction,
it
was
to
tell
that
jury
that
they
were
not
going
to
be
giving
mr.
hill
something
that
he
had
already
had;
it
was
to
clarify
the
situation
of
the
problem
that
they
created.
and
in
their
briefs,
they
argue
it
like
this,
your
honor:
"to
nail
this
point
home
and
to
get
the
full
benefit
of
the
board’s
finding"
--
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
i'm
on
page
39,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
"to
nail
this
point
home
and
to
get
the
full
benefit
of
the
board’s
finding,
petitioner
requested
and
obtained
an
instruction
informing
the
jury
that
hill
had
filed
a
charge
with
the
board,
that
he
received
an
award
covering
the
wages
that
he
would
have
earned"
and
so
forth.
that
was
to
prevent
error,
to
prevent
injustice.
it
was
not
our
attempt
to
capitalize
on
that,
as
has
been
pointed
out.
your
honor,
one
important
thing
that
we
haven't
covered
that
we
should
--
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
it's
arguable
whether
you
could
or
not,
because
this
court
has
not
made
pronouncements
on
certain
of
the
issues.
it
would
be
involved
in
a
violation
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
yes,
the
case
could
have
been
presented,
and
basically
the
facts
would
have
been
identical
under
that
theory.
the
lower
court,
first,
we
--
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
no,
they
are
not.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
yes,
your
honor,
i
can.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
they
could
have
within
the
confines
of
what
the
unfair-representation
cases
around
the
country
have
involved.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
they
could
have
said
that,
that's
true.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
that's
right,
it
may
not
have
stood
up
in
the
long
run,
and
under
tort
law
it
does
stand
up.
they
may
have
said
there's
no
punitive
damages,
because
there
is
an
argument
that
there
is
not,
although
i
don't
think
it's
a
convincing
argument;
but
they
could
have
taken
that
position,
and
we
would
not
have
had
the
punitive
damages
in
the
case.
the
point
i
wanted
to
get
was
congressional
intent.
we
start
with
the
assumption
unfortunately
that
congress
intended
under
the
labor
management
relations
act
to
include
intra-union
disputes.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
we
went
back
and
examined
it,
that's
not
the
case.
this
court
has
on
several
occasions,
particularly
following
the
enactment
of
the
act,
searched
for
congressional
intent.
and
to
summarize
or
paraphrase
some
of
the
positions
of
the
court,
but
in
1953
in
laburnum
this
court
said
by
the
lmra,
congress
intended
to
increase
the
availability
of
state
tort
law.
in
1954
in
russell,
the
court
said
that
congress
has
not
deprived
the
courts
of
jurisdiction
over
the
type
of
conduct
involved
there.
in
gonzales
in
‘58,
congress
did
not
intend
to
preempt
the
protection
of
union
members
from
arbitrary
conduct.
and
then
in
garmon,
as
the
court
knows
--
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
there
were
several
defendants,
your
honor.
there
were
three
business
agents,
two
of
whom
were
let
out
of
the
case
by
the
jury,
one
of
whom
mr.
daley
was
found
liable
to
him.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
it
runs
against
him
personally,
which
is
a
good
point,
too.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
against
the
local
also
and
against
the
district
council.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
under
the
cases
that
that
would
not
be
an
action
against
him.
the
suit
went
against
all
three
of
them.
in
the
search
for
congressional
intent,
this
court
…
well,
even
in
lynn,
the
court
stated
that
they
had
not
received
much
congressional
guidance
on
the
issue
of
whether
these
torts,
torturous
conduct
was
involved
was
within
the
act
or
without
the
act.
and
even
in
lynn,
where
the
conduct
was
directed
to
the
heart
of
the
lmra,
organizational
activity
was
directed
to
the
heart,
this
court
said,
"we're
fashioning
an
exception".
they
added
malice
to
the
torturous
exception
that
had
been
previously
cut
out
in
garmon.
and
so
we
go
two
ways
on
this
case.
we
suggest
to
you
that
we
are
within
the
exceptions
of
garmon;
that
this
is
interest
which
is
deeply
rooted
within
the
state
of
california,
or
that
it
is
of
such
peripheral
concern
to
the
lmra
that
it
should
not
be
preempted
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.
both
of
those
exceptions
are
perfectly
applicable
if
you
look
at
it
in
a
broad
way.
if
you
say,
“well,
we're
not
going
to
restrict
the
right
of
redress;
we're
going
to
look
at
it
liberally
to
produce
justice
to
an
agreed
individual".
so
this
is
torturous
conduct.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
conduct
that
should
be
preempted,
like
lynn,
for
example,
was
preempted.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
just
against
the
local
union.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
no,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
daley,
some
of
mr.
daley’s
testimony
that
i
took
from
that
transcript
impeached
him
in
his
trial
testimony
to
show
what
--
how
he
would
say
both
sides
have
an
issue
in
order
to
gain
advantage.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
and
the
answer,
your
honor,
is
that
the
essence
of
the
tort
does
not
lie
in
the
peripheral
conduct.
the
essence
of
the
tort
--
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
yes,
your
honor,
you
would;
but
the
point
that
i
want
to
make
is
this:
that
tort
would
not
have
included
…
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
--
the
starvation
of
the
man.
he
worked
133
hours
in
a
year-and-a-half,
because
they
constantly
like
a
yoyo
rotated
him
up
and
down
that
out-of-work
list.
now,
we
can
come
in
and
mr.
hill
could
say,
“well,
i'm
aggrieved,
because
i'm
called
a
son
of
a
bitch”.
he
could
say
that,
but
that's
not
the
gist
of
his
action.
this
man
was
starved
to
death
for
a
year-and-a-half!
and
that's
why,
your
honor,
we
suggest
--
we've
given
this
issue
some
thought.
we
have
a
suggestion
that
is
a
better
application
of
the
law.
we
feel
that
the
law
has
led
to
triumphs
of
procedure
over
substance.
it
has
denied
remedies
from
time
to
time
to
people
who
have
been
injured,
because
earlier
decisions
of
the
court
can't
be
interpreted
apparently
uniformly
around
the
country.
mr.
cain
and
i
have
suggested
and
offered
to
the
court
the
alternative
of
the
following:
we
have
alluded
to
it
to
some
extent,
but
we've
enlarged
on
it
for
this
argument.
first
as
a
test
determine
if
the
state
law
attempts
to
regulate
labor
relations
as
such
and,
if
you
decide
that
it
does,
preempt
it.
if
you
decide
that
it
does
not,
ask
the
next
question:
does
the
application
of
the
state
law
have
a
substantial
practical
effect
on
the
federal
regulatory
scheme?
and,
your
honor,
if
you
answer
that
question
in
the
affirmative,
preempt
it.
but
if
you
say
no,
that
it
doesn't,
then
let
the
state
law
of
general
applicability
be
applied,
because
that
is
the
only
way
there
will
be
effective
redress
for
the
injury.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
i'm
suggesting,
your
honor,
that
it
is
probably
easier
than
the
"arguably"
test
and
the
“crux”
test.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
well,
you
probably
could.
that's
why
we
included
the
word
"practical"
was
to
get
away
from
the
technical
arguments
of
a
lawyer
arguing
"arguable".
that's
been
the
problem
that
you've
been
faced
with,
and
that's
the
problem
that
the
lower
courts
have
been
faced
with.
everything
is
arguable.
now,
maybe
"substantial"
is
a
word
that
would
have
some
debate
and
perhaps
"practical";
but
that
really
is
the
test,
isn't
it,
to
determine
whether
this
does
or
doesn't
interfere
with
federal
policy,
the
federal
labor
scheme.
how
could
allowing
california
to
redress
this
injury
to
mr.
hill
affect
the
federal
regulatory
scheme?
it
can't.
they
say,
“well,
large
damages
might
be
awarded.”
but
as
this
court
said
in
lynn
and
elsewhere,
that's
what
we
have
trial
judges
for.
that's
what
you
have
appellate
judges
for,
to
determine
whether
the
jury
went
haywire
on
a
given
issue.
we're
not
going
to
destroy
the
labor
movement.
as
a
court
in
lynn
said,
labor
has
grown
up.
why
should
labor
unions
be
exempt?
charitable
organizations
aren't
exempt.
small
businesses
aren't
exempt.
who
is
exempt?
no
one
except
the
labor
organizations
if
you
apply
this
"crux"
and
"arguable"
test.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
no,
it
embellishes
upon
it;
but
that's
the
source
of
the
idea
was
the
morton
case.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
yes,
it
is
a
little
different.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
yes,
i
thought
i'd
made
that
quite
clear.
i
did
not
mean
to
say
i
was
reiterating
what
was
in
the
brief.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
we
have
attempted
to
elaborate
on
it,
because
we
can
see
problems
that
the
court's
going
to
see.
and
we're
trying
to
fashion
something
that
will
be
of
help
to
the
court
and
help
to
the
lower
courts
and
increase
justice.
keep
in
mind
the
one
problem
with
the
nlrb
is
this:
if
a
matter
is
arguably
an
unfair
labor
practice,
think
of
that
vast
no-man’s
land
that
exists,
and
no
case
in
the
world
could
illustrate
it
better
than
your
decision
in
lockridge,
in
1971,
i
believe.
if
you
recall
in
lockridge,
the
greyhound
bus
driver
had
been
terminated
from
his
employment
and
pressed
to
the
union,
because
he
was
behind
in
his
dues.
mr.
lockridge
filed
a
lawsuit
claiming
various
things
and
got
a
judgment.
and
it
came
up
to
this
court,
and
this
court
said,
no,
that
is
arguably
preempted,
and
the
judgment
was
taken
from
him.
mr.
lockridge’s
colleague,
elmer
day
--
and
this
is
a
footnote
in
that
case
--
elmer
day
says,
“i'm
not
going
to
file
with
the
court
first.
i
know
you're
supposed
to
go
to
the
nlrb",
and
he
filed
with
the
nlrb;
but
they
declined
to
accept
the
case.
and
so
he
said,
“now,
i
can
go
to
the
court.”
so
he
went
to
court.
he
got
a
judgment
because
he
had
been
aggrieved,
and
the
oregon
court
took
it
away,
claiming
that
it
was
arguably
preempted.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
that's
the
end
of
it.
so,
you
see,
you
have
two
men
who
competent
juries,
properly
charged,
took
the
position
that
they
had
been
aggrieved,
and
they
gave
damages
to
both
of
them,
and
they
went
different
routes,
the
only
routes
available
to
them
under
the
law.
they
went
both
routes,
and
in
both
routes
they
ended
up
with
nothing.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
of
course,
i
couldn’t
agree
more;
but
that's
not
what
congress
intended,
your
honor.
there
is
no
showing
--
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
well,
your
honor,
i
cited,
for
example,
laburnum,
lynn,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
lynn's
not.
even
in
lockridge,
your
honor,
this
court
said
that
they
couldn't
find
any
express
direction
from
congress.
and
how
about
additional
things?
the
fact
that
the
lmrda
was
passed
in
1959;
the
landrum-griffin
act
had
savings
clauses.
it
said
we're
not
going
to
take
away
any
of
the
rights
that
union
men
have
in
their
disputes
or
whatever.
we're
not
going
to
take
away
any
rights
that
they
have
from
state
or
federal
law.
when
they
passed
that
act,
they
gave
them
certain
other
rights
under
that
act,
as
we
pointed
out
in
the
brief.
now,
what
did
congress
think
the
law
was
at
that
point?
this
shows
you
congressional
intent,
i
believe.
at
that
point
when
garmon
was
decided,
i
think
like
three
days
before
congress
enacted
the
landrum-griffin
bill,
congress
knew
that
the
principle
of
garmon
was
limited
to
union
management
disputes.
they
had
no
reason
to
think
that
gonzales
was
going
to
subsequently
be
emasculated.
they
thought
that
gonzales
was
the
law.
they
also
thought
that
laburnum
was
the
law
and
russell
was
the
law.
that's
what
the
position
was
of
congress.
at
that
time,
they
said
we
don't
want
to
do
anything
to
interfere
with
those
rights.
and
so
when
later
courts
began
to
assume
that
congress
intended
under
the
lmra
that
any
internal
union
dispute
is
preempted,
i
respectfully
submit,
your
honor,
that's
an
erroneous
conclusion
based
on
congressional
intent.
this
court
has
never
made
that
conclusion.
the
best
that
this
court
has
ever
done
to
that
side
of
the
issue
is
to
say
we
can't
find
any
evidence
of
congressional
intent
regarding
that.
your
honor,
if
i
may,
if
there
are
questions,
i'll
answer
them.
i
would
like
to
reserve,
if
i
may,
whatever
remaining
time
i
might
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
thank
you.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
very
briefly,
your
honor,
a
couple
of
comments
were
made,
i
think,
that
should
have
some
comment
to
them.
to
say
that
this
case
is
not
preempted
factually,
your
honor,
in
the
case
of
garmon,
garmon
has
made
the
following
statement,
which
i
quote
verbatim:
"redress
for
arbitrary
bad
faith,
fraudulent"
--
i
said
i
was
quoting
it
verbatim,
but
that's
not
correct.
quite
right,
i
have
included
from
several
places
the
type
of
conduct;
but
it
is
a
true
incorrect
paraphrasing.
"redress
for
arbitrary
bad
faith,
fraudulent,
deceitful
or
other
dishonest
conduct
does
not
conflict
with
federal
labor
policy
or
is
at
most
tolerably
slight."
in
hardman,
the
court
will
remember
that
the
business
agent
got
hit
in
the
nose,
because
he
wouldn't
dispatch
a
member,
or
a
couple
of
men
apparently,
to
a
job
where
they
had
been
requested
by
an
employer.
the
union
claimed
preemption
in
that
case,
too,
arguably
and
unfair
labor
practice,
they
said.
the
court
expressly
held
that
it
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice.
go
quickly
to
gonzales.
they
say,
well,
gonzales
is
no
good,
because
this
was
not
an
expulsion
case.
may
it
please
this
court,
the
worst
penalty
that
could
be
imposed
is
not
to
make
it
an
expulsion
case.
by
keeping
mr.
hill
in
the
union,
the
wiser
dictatorial-type
tyrant
says,
“i
can
keep
this
out
of
the
courts.
i
can
keep
it
in
the
nlrb.
i
won't
expel
mr.
hill;
i'll
just
knife
him
to
death
as
a
member,
and
perhaps
with
a
smile
on
my
face"
is
the
physical
effect
of
hardman,
which
is
not
preempted
because
he
got
hit
on
the
nose,
any
different
because
mr.
hill
didn't
get
hit
in
the
stomach,
but
nevertheless
suffered
enduring
and
longstanding
pain?
those
are
distinctions
without
differences,
and
what
it
boils
down
to
is
what
i
was
complaining
about
at
the
beginning.
it
provides
for
triumphs
of
procedure,
not
redress
of
the
actual
harm.
your
honor,
the
trial
of
this
case
was
not
a
trial
of
the
hiring-hall
practices,
not
the
legality.
we
had
to
show
where
the
discrimination
occurred.
they
used
the
hiring
hall
as
the
vehicle
to
impose
upon
mr.
hill
this
discrimination.
we
had
to
show
simply
two
easy
issues
to
the
jury:
one,
what
the
rules
were;
and,
two,
were
they
fairly
applied.
that's
all.
that
doesn't
require
expertise
of
the
national
labor
relations
board,
not
at
all.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
the
hiring-hall
rules.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
they
came
in
the
form
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
admitted
without
objection.
they
came
in
the
form
of
the
hiring-hall
procedures
set
forth
by
the
union,
which
even
in
the
preamble
to
that
says
pursuant
to
the
collective
bargain
agreement
these
are
the
rules,
and
in
them
it
says
you
hire
on
a
nondiscriminatory
basis
following
the
list.
mr.
g.
dana
hobart
that's
what
it
said.
i'm
somewhat
distressed
that
the
nlrb
is
here
on
an
opposite
side.
we
are
trying,
as
i
see
it,
to
protect
union
members,
whatever
the
number
may
be,
few
or
great,
who
occasionally
may
be
subjected
to
this
type
of
tyranny.
we
don't
want
to
put
the
nlrb
out
of
business;
we
want
to
expand
the
ability
to
redress
these
wrongs.
and
the
afl-cio,
your
honor,
has
told
this
court
in
their
amicus
brief
that
they
represent
14
million
people.
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor
that
they
represent
the
leadership
of
labor
organizations.
mr.
hill,
who
is
now
departed,
mr.
hill,
your
honor
represents
the
14
million
people.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
in
my
mind
or
heart.
thank
you,
your
honor.
