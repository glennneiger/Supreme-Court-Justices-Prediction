unknown
speaker
what
you're
telling
us
now,
i
take
it,
comes
out
of
the
record
in
the
trial
of
the
case
in
the
state
court.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
not
suggesting,
are
you,
that
the
hiring
hall
in
this
form
and
that
these
regulations
were
illegal
under
the
federal
labor
law.
unknown
speaker
perfectly
legitimate,
part
of
the
bargaining
agreement.
unknown
speaker
well,
your
adversaries,
as
i
understand
it,
contended
the
more
you
tie
hill's
complaint
against
daley
into
hill's
job-discrimination
claim,
the
worse
off
you
are
for
federal
preemption
purposes.
do
you
agree
with
that
or
not?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
i
suppose
you're
saying
that
because
it's
done
under
color
of
union
authority
and
somewhat
as
in
civil-rights
cases,
that
doesn't
mean
necessarily
federal
preemption.
unknown
speaker
that's
unemployment
compensation.
unknown
speaker
was
he
still
an
officer
of
the
union
at
this
time?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
unfair
practice
claimed?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
potentially
every
instance
in
which
he
sought
a
job
and
didn't
get
it
because
of
what
you
claim
to
be
the
unauthorized
conduct
of
your
opposition
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
unknown
speaker
well,
each
time
he
claimed
a
job
and
was
refused
it
unfairly,
wouldn't
that
be
arguably
an
unfair
practice?
unknown
speaker
suppose
in
the
one
instance
where
you
went
before
the
board,
suppose
you
also
sued
in
state
court
for
an
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
harm.
that's
all
the
case
was
about,
and
the
state
court
entertained
it
and
said,
yes,
we
have
a
cause
of
action
like
that
here.
do
you
think
you
could
maintain
your
action
at
the
same
time,
pressure
of
unfair
labor
practice,
before
the
board?
unknown
speaker
i
know;
but
the
question
is,
could
you
maintain
both,
both
the
unfair
labor-practice
charge
and
the
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
he
said,
yes,
he
thought
he
could.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know;
but
what
about
garmon?
isn't
that
like
the
case
in
point?
unknown
speaker
you're
claiming
the
same
conduct
violates
the
8(b)-something
and
also
violates
a
state
law
against
inflicting
emotional
harm.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
hobart,
isn't
the
case
mr.
justice
white
put
to
you
the
borden
case?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
aren't
the
facts
he
posited
those
that
were
present
in
borden?
unknown
speaker
is
it
critical
for
your
cause
of
action
in
the
state
courts
that
you
prove
that
this
conduct
was
not
only
with
the
intent
of
inflicting
emotional
pain
and
suffering,
but
that
it
was
otherwise
illegal
under
some
law?
unknown
speaker
but
regardless
of
whether
the
conduct
is
otherwise
legal
or
illegal.
unknown
speaker
or
any
laws.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know.
but
does
california
require
you
to
prove
that
the
conduct
is
otherwise
illegal
under
california
law?
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
elements
of
the
tort?
unknown
speaker
and
sustained.
unknown
speaker
but
it
didn't
have
to
be
illegal
under
california
law
otherwise,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
a
tort
under
california
common
law.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
there
are
or
might
be
occasions
where
there's
an
affirmative
defense,
such
as
a
reference
of
a
prospective
employee
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
no,
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
so,
what
california
law?
suppose
the
hiring
hall
had
been
administered
totally
legally
in
the
sense
that
your
client
got
every
job
he
should
have
and
didn't
get
any
job
that
he
should
not
have,
but
in
the
process
of
administering
it
that
way
there
was
outrageous
conduct
that
caused
him
emotional
harm.
now,
you
could
be
covering
california
there.
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
think
it
is
more
like
an
intentional
and
egregious
libel,
then.
unknown
speaker
does
an
unfair
labor
practice
provide
an
adequate
remedy
for
this?
unknown
speaker
the
difficulty
is
that
an
awful
lot
of
your
--
an
awful
lot
of
your
evidence,
or
at
least
an
awful
lot
of
your
assertions
in
this
case,
are
that
the
hiring
hall
was
illegally
administered.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
ways
that
apparently
would
give
you
some
basis
for
going
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
for
unfair
labor
practice.
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
only
went
there
once,
but
it
sounds
to
me
like
you
could
have
gone
there
many
other
times
on
the
same
claim.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
what
does
mr.
daley
do
outside
of
his
union
activities?
unknown
speaker
did
he
find
anything
that
wasn't
directly
connected
with
the
activities
of
the
union?
unknown
speaker
like
what?
unknown
speaker
have
you
ever
been
to
any
union
meetings?
unknown
speaker
have
you
ever
heard
that
phrase?
unknown
speaker
have
you
ever
heard
that
phrase?
unknown
speaker
well,
all
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is
that
it
just
appears
to
me
that
this
began
as
a
union
matter,
it
ended
as
a
union
matter,
and
everything
in
between
was
a
union
matter.
unknown
speaker
when
conduct
of
this
kind
takes
place
under
color
of
union
authority,
under
color
of
union
authority,
and
the
powers
are
abused,
there's
no
remedy
under
the
labor
act
and
the
man
is
left
to
the
traditional
remedies
under
state
law.
unknown
speaker
didn’t
they
all
--
didn’t
they
award
him
2500
bucks?
unknown
speaker
what
page
are
you
on
there?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
would
you
have
a
…
could
you
secure
all
the
remedy
you
might
need
if
you
brought
a
suit
for
unfair
representation
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
suits
for
unfair
representation
are
not
preempted,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
can
you
bring
them
in
state
court,
as
well
as
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
reason
why
the
superior
court
of
los
angeles
county
wherever
this
was
couldn't
have
assumed
jurisdiction
of
this
case
on
an
unfair
representation?
unknown
speaker
and
they
in
the
first
instance
might
have
said
part
of
your
damages
are
pain
and
suffering.
unknown
speaker
it
may
not
have
stood
up
in
the
long
run,
but
…
unknown
speaker
who
are
the
defendants
in
this
suit,
or
who
were
the
defendants
in
the
suit?
unknown
speaker
so
does
the
judgment
run
against
him
personally?
unknown
speaker
and
against
the
union?
against
the
union,
also?
unknown
speaker
now,
your
unfair-representation
suit
probably
wouldn’t
be
good
against
an
individual,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hobart,
let
me
interrupt
you
once
more.
on
the
back-pay
award
that
the
labor
board
did
award
your
client,
did
that
award
just
run
against
the
local
union?
did
it
run
against
the
international?
unknown
speaker
there
was,
of
course,
no
remedy
at
all
against
blackie
individually.
unknown
speaker
hold
on.
unknown
speaker
before
you
go
on,
earlier
in
your
argument,
as
i
understood
what
you
said
responding
to
a
question
to
mr.
justice
white,
your
answer
was
that
even
if
there
had
been
no
discrimination
in
the
hiring
hall,
the
evidence
in
this
case
would
support
a
tort
action
under
california
law.
unknown
speaker
now,
if
that
is
true
and
if
the
evidence
really
would
sustain
the
validity
of
the
statements
you've
made,
why
do
you
spend
so
much
time
arguing
to
us
subtle
distinctions
in
cases
that
do
involve
the
nlra?
if
you
have
a
pure
tort
action,
why
don't
you
emphasize
that?
that's
the
essence
of
my
question.
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
you
right
there?
i
think
you
had
said
earlier,
said
that
in
law
(inaudible)
supports
the
view
that
there
may
be
a
personal
tort
without
physical
wrongdoing.
if
verbal
acts
and
verbal
conduct,
verbal
abuse,
reaches
a
certain
level
wholly
without
regard
to
any
hiring
hall,
wouldn't
you
have
a
tort
under
california
law?
unknown
speaker
some
of
the
elements
you
rely
on,
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
that
test
is
easy
to
apply?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
substantial
practical
effect
on
labor
affair,
your
--
the
second
prong
of
your
test?
that
sounds
to
me
like
it
could
bristle
with
difficulty.
unknown
speaker
now,
in
your
brief,
you
suggested
that
the
test,
or
at
least
a
test
better
than
the
garmon
test,
is
the
one
suggested
by
morton,
and
it's
the
one
you
are
now
orally
presenting.
unknown
speaker
--
you
think
it's
equivalent
to
that,
or
is
it
still
a
third
test?
unknown
speaker
but
what
you
are
now
telling
us
orally
is
a
little
different
from
what
the
…
unknown
speaker
…
the
(inaudible)
test,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
before
the
board,
if
the
general
counsel
declines
to
take
the
complaint,
that's
the
end
of
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that's
what
congress
intended,
they
should
have
ended
up
with
nothing.
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
going
against
a
fair
of
number
of
cases
that
it
said
it
did
intend
that.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
those
were
in
the
pre-garmon
era.
the
lynn
wasn't.
the
laburnum
--
unknown
speaker
but
would
you
admit
there
were
a
few
embellishments
added?
unknown
speaker
but
what
was
--
were
they
…
was
it
necessary
for
the
jury
…
there
was
a
jury,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
was
it
necessary
for
the
jury
in
bringing
in
a
verdict
to
find
that
any
actions
of
the
union
or
of
its
representative
were
illegal
under
any
law,
or
that
was
it
necessary
to
find
that
the
hiring
hall
had
been
improperly
administered?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know;
but
how
about
in
the
instructions?
did
the
instructions
require
it
to
find
one
way
or
another
that
the
union
had
mal-administered
the
hiring
hall?
unknown
speaker
where
is
that,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
which
volume
is
that?
unknown
speaker
page
61,
you
say?
unknown
speaker
the
form
of
these
instructions
just
says
requested
instruction;
but
it
does
not
state
--
indicate
whether
the
judge
gave
it
or
not.
is
the
fact
that
it's
in
here
mean
that
the
judge
gave
it,
or
just
that
it
was
requested?
unknown
speaker
well,
before;
we're
back
to
41.
unknown
speaker
now,
where
is
the
instruction
that
says
that
the
jury
must
find
that
the
union
had
not
administered
the
hiring
hall
in
accordance
with
the
applicable
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
hardly
responsive
to
my
question,
so
that
your
answer
to
my
question
is
that,
no,
there
was
no
instruction
that
required
the
jury
to
find
that
the
hiring
hall
had
been
improperly
--
unknown
speaker
there
was
nothing
that
would
have
required
the
jury
to
find
what
the
board
found
in
this
one
incident.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
might
be
very
relevant
to
state
tort
actions.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
lynn
is
still
good
law?
unknown
speaker
now,
don't
you
suppose
in
a
case
like
that,
it
might
be
very
relevant
to
show
what
kind
of
damage
you
might
have
received
from
a
gross
libel
to
introduce
what
happened
to
you
in
seeking
jobs?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
california
court
in
this
case
had
conformed
to
all
those
lynn
safeguards;
that
is,
instructed
that
intent
was
required
and
had
followed
the
cautionary
road
to
punitive
damages?
wouldn't
there
be
a
remarkable
similarity
between
this
case
and
lynn?
unknown
speaker
well,
wait
a
minute.
wait
a
minute,
counsel.
some
of
the
acts
proved
--
as
i
understand,
one
of
them
was
a
battery,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
don't
mean
about
instruction,
but
wasn't
there
evidence
that
there
was
a
battery
in
the
case?
i
mean
the
tort
of
battery,
not
an
automobile
battery.
unknown
speaker
no,
of
a
battery.
unknown
speaker
no,
wasn't
there
evidence
tending
to
show
a
battery.
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
the
complaint
had
simply
sought
damages
for
the
battery
and
had
not
gone
into
anything
else
in
the
superior
court
of
los
angeles
county.
would
you
contend
that
it
was
preempted?
unknown
speaker
if
that's
the
case,
why
isn't
your
proper
remedy
in
the
superior
court
to
ask
that
evidence
be
stricken
that
goes
outside
of
that
and,
on
appeal,
to
ask
that
any
part
of
the
recovery
that
goes
beyond
that,
if
you
were
right
in
conceding
that
only
that
was
recoverable,
be
taken
away
rather
than
saying
there's
complete
preemption?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
your
theory,
mr.
geffner?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
theory
that
anything
done
by
a
business
agent
under
color
of
the
authority
of
the
union
is
preempted?
unknown
speaker
let's
take
a
hypothetical
that
goes
beyond
this
someone;
that
the
evidence
in
a
case
to
a
state
court
and
jury
would
show
that
over
a
period
of
years
the
business
agent
and
others
within
the
union
hierarchy
systematically
conspired
and
succeeded
in
keeping
a
member
of
the
union
from
employment
and
from
benefits
of
union
membership.
you
say
that
that
being
done
under
color
of
the
authority
of
the
union,
that's
preempted,
and
his
only
remedy
is
an
unfair-labor
practice
claim.
unknown
speaker
what
you're
necessarily
saying
is
that
the
conduct
of
daley
shown
by
this
record
in
the
state
court
is
permissible
conduct.
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
is
then
the
law
(a),
provide
for
mental
pain
and
anguish?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
worries
me.
this
case
is
a
tort
with
specific
common-law
right,
and
i
assume
that
that
is
not
covered
by
nlra.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
that
nothing
in
the
nlra
that
stops
union
people
from
cursing,
because
you'd
have
to
change
a
whole
lot
of
unions?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
your
union
is
as
overanxious
as
ours
are,
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
(inaudible.)
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
go
about
finding
out
what
was
the
crux
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
would
that
suggest
that
that
might
be
because
that
was
within
the
orbit
of
state-court
tort
matters?
unknown
speaker
let
me
see
if
i
understand
your
argument,
mr.
geffner.
is
it
that
if
the
conduct
complained
of
is
within
the
general
framework
of
the
business
agent’s
activity,
hiring
hall,
union
meetings
or
what-not,
then
it's
preempted?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
suggest
that
this
record
does
not
show
abuse
of
union
power
and
malicious
use
of
union
power
to
the
detriment
of
this
petitioner?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know
if
that
answers
my
question.
unknown
speaker
let
me
put
it
another
way.
do
you
say,
then,
all
of
the
conduct
that's
shown
by
this
record
is
protected
conduct?
unknown
speaker
do
you
argue
that
the
board
is
capable
of
dealing
with
all
of
the
abuses
of
union
power
that
occur?
unknown
speaker
but
even
if
we
assume
that
the
nlrb
would
have
found
that
in
each
one
of
these
episodes
there
was
discrimination,
nonetheless,
your
argument
would
be
the
same,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
your
argument
would
be
precisely
the
same.
unknown
speaker
but
the
issue
of
violation
of
the
hiring-hall
regulations
was
never
submitted
to
the
jury,
but
there
was
evidence.
there
was
evidence
of
conduct
in
the
administration
of
the
hiring
hall
…
unknown
speaker
…
that
you
claim
the
board
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
for.
unknown
speaker
the
complaint
in
the
nlrb,
because
the
complaint
also
that
during
this
same
period,
"the
defendants
repeatedly
threaten
plaintiff
with
actual
or
de
facto
expulsion
from
the
union
in
retaliation
for
his
political
activities
and
further
threatened
to
deprive
plaintiff
of
his
ability
to
earn
a
living
as
a
carpenter".
now,
suppose
the
evidence
centered
solely
around
that
allegation.
you
wouldn’t
be
for
that,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
but
their
evidence
wasn't
limited
to
do
that,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you
what
i
asked
your
adversary
about
an
unfair-representation
suit?
unknown
speaker
now,
i
suppose
this
hiring
hall
was
part
of
the
administration
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract.
unknown
speaker
and
if
there
was
a
failure
to
represent
this
man
fairly,
i
suppose
he
might
have
a
suit.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
i
know.
but
that
kind
of
a
suit
wouldn't
have
been
subject
to
a
preemption
at
all.
unknown
speaker
even
if
the
conduct
might
have
been
an
unfair
labor
practice
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
that
it
wasn’t;
but
i'm
just
wondering
if
there
was
some
remedy
provided
by
federal
law
aside
from
the
board.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
if
everything
that
was
alleged
here
was
proved
by
the
plaintiff,
that
it
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
duty
to
fairly
represent?
unknown
speaker
mr.
geffner,
a
major
element
in
mr.
hill’s
complaint
was
that
he
was
denied
employment
by
activities,
as
you
say,
at
the
hiring
hall.
let's
assume
that
there
was
only
one
activity.
let's
assume
that
mr.
daley
as
president
of
the
union
on
union
stationary
wrote
a
letter
to
every
contractor
and
every
subcontractor
in
the
los
angeles
area
saying
that
mr.
hill
was
a
convicted
thief
and
not
legible
for
employment
by
virtue
of
his
criminal
record.
let's
assume
that
was
false.
assume
no
other
evidence
of
discrimination.
it
resulted
in
…
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
deny
job
opportunities
to
mr.
hill?
unknown
speaker
are
you
thinking
in
that
case
there
would
have
been
relief
both
under
the
board
and
in
the
state
courts
of
california?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
in
brother
powell’s
example
damages
would
include
loss
of
employment.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
in
a
state
action.
unknown
speaker
in
a
state-law
tort
action.
unknown
speaker
he
assumes
it
wasn’t,
though.
unknown
speaker
mr.
geffner,
it
would
not
also
be
true
in
a
defamation
action
that
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
defamation
could
turn
on
the
nature
of
the
hiring-hall
practices
--
in
other
words,
it
could
be
a
false
statement
made
about
a
man
that
would
be
true
or
false,
depending
on
what
kind
of
practices
were
followed
--
and
it
would
not
therefore
also
be
true
that
evidence
relating
to
hiring-hall
practices
would
be
admissible
if
the
tort
action
was
a
proper
action?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
argue
for
a
broad
rule
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
conduct
is
subject
to
board
prohibition
or
protection
would
make
the
evidence
always
inadmissible.
unknown
speaker
the
instruction
is
pretty
close
to
that,
but
you
don't
really
ask
for
that.
unknown
speaker
do
you
disagree
with
that,
that
that
was
necessary?
unknown
speaker
mr.
combs,
can
i
just
interrupt
you
right
there?
unknown
speaker
supposing
on
precisely
the
same
record
that
we
have
here
the
court
of
appeals
of
california
had
said
the
crux
of
this
case
as
we
understand
it
is
whether
the
elements
of
the
common-law
tort
for
present
--
namely,
was
the
conduct
outrageous,
was
it
intentional,
was
it
sustained
--
and
all
this
other
evidence
of
hiring-hall
practice
just
merely
tends
to
prove
one
of
those
three
elements
of
the
tort.
if
they
had
said
those
three
elements
were
the
crux
of
the
case,
would
we
then
have
a
different
result?
unknown
speaker
if
the
characterization
of
the
crux
of
the
action
is
a
federal
question,
then
does
it
not
conversely
follow
that
we're
not
bound
by
the
court
of
appeals'
characterization
as
primarily
involving
hiring
hall,
but
we
have
a
duty
independently
to
decide
whether
that's
the
proper
description
of
the
character
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
combs,
in
reciting
the
long
line
of
precedents
which
you
said
would
have
to
be
overruled,
i
noticed
you
didn't
mention
the
pre-garmon
cases
of
this
court,
garner
and
laburnum
and
russell.
are
you
suggesting
that
garmon
itself
represented
a
change
of
direction?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
there
are
any
cases
pre-garmon
that
are
not
in
the
mainstream?
how
about
gonzales?
unknown
speaker
it
was
preserved
by
lockridge,
too,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
question
gonzales.
unknown
speaker
well,
borden
was
tried
on
a
contract
theory,
too,
wasn't
it?
that
didn't
seem
to
save
it.
unknown
speaker
you
said
at
the
onset,
mr.
combs,
that
no
aspect
of
constitutional
law
is
involved
here,
but
surely
the
supremacy
clause
is.
that
is
involved,
isn't
it?
that's
always
involved
in
federal
preemption.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
only
because
of
the
supremacy
clause
that
you
have
to
decide
it
in
favor
of
the
federal
government
after
you've
determined
the
scope
of
the
preemption,
isn't
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
explicitness.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
rules
were?
you
say
you
had
to
show
two
relatively
simple
things
to
the
jury:
one,
what
the
rules
were.
now,
what
rules
are
you
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
uh-huh.
unknown
speaker
right.
