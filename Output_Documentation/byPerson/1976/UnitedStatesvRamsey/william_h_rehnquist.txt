do
you
think
after
the
carroll
case
the
government
needs
statutory
authority
to
stop
people
entering
and
crossing
the
border?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
your
position
is
that
the
statute
may
reflect
the
congress
has
intent,
that
the
full
constitutional
authority
of
the
government
should
not
be
exercised,
that
they
adhere
to
a
standard
of
reasonableness,
whereas
they
would
not
have
to
in
the
absence
of
the
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
the
fourth
amendment
impose
any
requirement
at
all
as
to
border
searches
after
the
carroll
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
certainly,
chief
justice’s
task
language
in
that
case
does
not
give
you
any
impression
that
there
is
any
limitation
on
the
authority
of
the
government
to
search
at
the
border.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
a
customs
officials
sees
an
envelope
that
contains
nothing
thicker
than
a
normal
sized
letter,
but
his
experience
tells
him
it
might
be
currency
that
would
be
subject
to
duty
or
subject
to
some
sort
of
prohibition?
is
he
under
regulation
free
to
open
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
some
risk,
but
under
current
regulations,
he
does
not
read
that
letter
and
he
merely
stamps
the
envelope
as
having
been
opened,
reseals
it,
and
sends
it
on
its
way.
now,
in
response
to
the
question
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
a
moment
ago,
it
is
true
that
in
1971,
the
customs
service
after
consultation
with
the
postal
service
changed
its
procedures
for
inspecting
international
letter
class
mail,
but
these
changes
represent
we
believe
only
a
modification
of
prior
practices
rather
than
a
drastic
break
with
the
past.
the
important
fact
to
be
noted
is
that,
at
no
time
in
our
nation’s
history,
not
before
1971
and
not
after
1971,
has
a
sender
or
addressee
of
international
letter
class
mail
sent
into
this
country
ever
had
any
expectation
that,
that
envelope
would
be
delivered
to
its
destination
without
being
opened
in
the
presence
of
the
customs
service.
now,
from
1924
when
the
universal
postal
convention
first
allowed
dutiable
articles
to
be
inserted
into
letter
class
mail,
until
1971,
the
practice
of
the
customs
service
and
the
postal
service
when
they
receive
the
letter
class
envelope
apparently
containing
merchandise
as
follows,
they
would
send
it
on,
notify
the
addressee
to
come
to
the
post
office,
and
they
would
not
turn
over
that
envelope
unless
the
addressee
consented
to
having
it
opened
by
the
customs
agent
standing
there.
now,
what
this
effectively
did
was
to
give
a
free
rein
to
smugglers.
since
if
their
envelopes
came
through
unopened,
then
they
had
succeeded,
if
on
the
other
hand,
their
envelope
was
stopped
and
they
were
notified
to
come
to
the
postal
service
and
pick
it
up,
they
would
simply
refuse
delivery.
under
the
universal
postal
convention
at
that
point,
the
letter
had
to
be
sent
back
to
the
country
of
origin,
unopened
presumably,
where
the
sender
could
try
to
send
it
again
and
hopefully
it
would
get
through
a
second
time.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
a
package
of
books?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
letter
then
in
your
view
has
a
superior
first
amendment
claim
to
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
ramsey
and
kelly
which
comes
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
respondents
were
convicted
of
the
unlawful
importation
of
heroin.
prior
to
trial,
they
moved
to
suppress
the
introduction
into
evidence
of
heroin
that
had
been
mailed
into
this
country
from
thailand
and
which
have
been
discovered
when
the
customs
inspector
opened,
without
a
warrant,
the
envelop
at
the
post
office
in
new
york
city.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
concluded
that
the
evidence
should
have
been
suppressed
since
it
viewed
the
fourth
amendment
in
conjunction
with
the
first
amendment
as
requiring
the
obtaining
of
a
warrant
upon
probable
cause
prior
to
the
opening
of
the
envelop.
since
this
conclusion
was
contrary
to
the
decisions
of
every
other
court
of
appeals
which
should
pass
down
the
question,
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
conflict.
for
the
reason
set
forth
and
an
opinion
which
has
been
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
we
conclude
that
congress
and
the
applicable
postal
regulations
authorized
this
search
and
that
they
authorized
customs
officials
to
search
any
envelop
in
which
they
have
a
reasonable
cause
to
suspect,
there
is
a
contraband
or
merchandise
imported
contrary
to
our
custom's
law.
we
also
conclude
the
constitution
does
not
prohibit
what
was
done
here.
a
longstanding
history
demonstrates
that
the
government
acting
without
a
warrant
may
search
persons
and
things
crossing
our
borders.
such
searches
are
reasonable
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
occur
at
the
border
without
warrant.
we
conclude
that
mail
should
be
treated
no
differently.
whereas
here
the
statute
authorizes
openings
upon
reasonable
cause
and
the
applicable
regulations
prohibit
the
reading
of
the
communications
after
the
opening
of
them
neither
the
first
nor
the
fourth
amendment
prohibits
the
opening
of
mail
at
the
border
without
a
search
warrant.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall
joined.
