mr.
allan
m.
palmer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
see
at
the
border
search
statute
continued,
concerned
19
u.s.c.
§
482,
which
was
the
progenitor
of
what
is
considered
in
the
carroll
case,
does
not
when
looked
at
in
historical
perspective,
allow
for
the
opening
of
international
letter
mail.
when
you
read
the
statute
in
light
of
its
history
and
genesis,
especially
when
it
was
enacted
in
--
1866
was
the
first
time
that
the
statute
allowed
for
the
opening
of
trunks
or
envelopes
wherever
found.
it
is
patently
clear
from
a
reading
of
that
statute
in
its
entirety
that
the
statute
only
was
concerned
with
trunks
or
envelopes,
wherever
found,
on
vehicle,
beast,
or
persons
at
the
border.
indeed
in
1970,
when
senator
ervin
objected
to
these
changes
that
came
about
in
1971,
that
was
just
discussed,
the
then
general
council
of
the
post
office,
and
it
is
recorded
at
footnote
5
of
our
brief
indicated,
that
there
are
not,
and
i
am
quoting
from
the
congressional
record.
“there
are
not
statutory
provisions
dealing
specifically
with
the
customs
treatment
of
any
type
of
incoming
foreign
mail”.
thereby,
rejecting
the
notion
that
19
u.s.c.
§
482
allowed
for
such
inspection,
at
least
in
the
view
of
the
general
council
of
that
department,
and…
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
i
find
that
hard
to
believe
chief
justice,
that
the
general
council
of
the
post
office
concerned
dealing
with
customs
day-to-day,
would
not
know
or
be
apprised
of
this
statute,
i
frankly
must
reject
that.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
assuming
he
did
not
know
about
it,
but
i
cannot…
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
the
only
alternative
i
can
say
is
he
knew
about
it
and
did
not
think
it
applied
to
the
circumstances
at
hand.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
i
think,
like
i
did,
he
viewed
the
history
of
that
statute,
the
progenitor
of
it
in
1866,
is
clear
that
it
only
concerned
with
envelopes
or
trunks
on
person,
vehicle,
etcetera,
and
that
the
present
statute
is
merely
a
shorthand
version
of
it.
i
think
the
reading
of
it,
and
the
court
gets
to
that,
we
will
see
that
is
abundantly
clear.
furthermore,
the
carroll
case
alluded
to
by
justice
rehnquist
makes
another
point
in
so
far
as
this
border
search
is
concerned,
and
it
spoke
of
the
border
search;
it
was
extrapolating
that
to
the
whisky
and
the
car
that
they
sought
to
stop
without
a
warrant.
in
viewing
the
border
search
statutes
what
they
said
were
enacted,
contemporaneous
with
the
fourth
amendment
and
this
nation’s
history.
that
even
then,
when
dealing
with
the
border
search,
the
statute,
the
foundation
statute,
enacted
at
the
beginning
of
this
nation
made
a
distinction,
even
where
dutiable
goods
were
concerned,
where
items
that
were
subject
to
disappear
into
the
country.
when
a
man
and
his
trunk
can
disappear
into
the
country,
the
statutes
indicated,
and
the
court
held
reason
of
exceptions
to
the
warrant
requirement,
that
there
was
no
warrant
required
because
of
the
exigency
of
the
situation.
the
individual
and
his
wares
would
disappear
into
a
still
rugged
country,
and
for
that
reason
the
warrant
was
not
required.
however…
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
in
reading
the
opinions
in
its
entirety
it
is
clear
that
the
court
in
carroll
in
that
language
was
speaking
about
the
travel
at
the
border
as
he
entered,
and
the
danger
of
him
disappearing
without
the
opportunity
to
get
a
search
warrant
for
him
or
his
wares.
the
court
in
carroll
itself,
as
we
read
it,
drew
the
distinction
when
these
items,
dutiable,
that
had
come
across
the
border
were
in
a
possession
to
be
searched
via
a
search
warrant,
the
statutes
themselves,
these
foundation
statutes,
require
the
customs
people
to
in
fact
get
a
search
warrant
regardless
of
the
fact
that
these
were
dutiable
goods,
had
come
across
the
border,
and
the
like.
i
think
for
that
reason
the
court
in
carroll,
which
was
possibly
one
of
the
only
cases
that
got
into
this
matter
in
some
detail,
clearly
makes
the
distinction
between
a
movable
situation,
ambulatory
situation,
and
a
permanent
situation.
in
fact,
that
was
the
basis
for
its
ruling
under
the
volstead
act
in
saying
that
the
car,
because
it
could
disappear,
there
was
no
warrant
required.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
i
think
that
the
two
coincide
as
--
i
would
read
the
opinion.
“in
any
event…
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
must
be
a
regulation,
i
would
think
your
honor.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
i
am
not
sure
of
the
exact
sequence,
your
honor,
but
we
have
it
laid
out
in
our
brief.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
that
is
one
of
our
points,
your
honor.
under
the
yvonne
lewin
(ph)
doctrine,
nothing
would
have
happened,
they
had
the
right
to
hold
it
for
up
to
29
hours,
except
to
probable
cause…
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
excuse
me?
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
i
think
the
addressee.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
of
course,
i
think
he
could
complain
that
his
mail
was
not
being
delivered?
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
in
the
particular
circumstance
in
this
case,
possibly
they
--
course
they
would
not,
but
we
are
talking
about
mail
as
such.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
probably
not.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
excuse
me?
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
under
that
sort
of
facts
whoever
--
under
the
facts
as
we
have
them,
the
opening
we
believe
violated
the…
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
of
course,
that’s…
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
but
your
honor
i
think…
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
i
do
not
believe
that
is
true,
blanketly,
no
sir.
i
think
--
i
do
not
believe…
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
excuse
me?
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
i
think
the
limitation
comes
from,
as
far
as
we
can
gather,
the
historical
fact
is
concerning
the
border
searches
and
the
question
of
exigent
or
whether
or
not
it
was
time
to
obtain
a
warrant.
the
carroll
case
as
we
alluded
to
clearly
makes
that
distinction.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
of
course.
well,
in
this
situation
with
these
statutes
--
the
government
is
relying
on
these
statutes,
and,
as
counsel
indicated
in
getting
--
allowing
for
the
opening
of
the
mail,
so
if
that
is
true,
it
would
be
that
limitation
that
was
exigent.
now,
historically
for
the
first
195
years
of
this
nation’s
history,
never
did
the
customs
people
acting
alone
seek
to
open
this
kind
of
mail,
letter
mail.
they
delivered
it,
required
the
addressee
to
get
there,
if
you
refused,
it
was
sent
back,
or
they
could
get
a
search
warrant
if
they
sought
to
enter
the
privacy
thereof.
but
never
in
this
nation’s
history
until
1971
did
the
customs
people
ever
think,
exercise,
the
power
that
was
exercised
in
this
case
to
enter
the
mail.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
the
government’s
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
yes,
sir.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
that
is
true.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
i
believe
there
is
no
statutory
authority.
there
was
some
regulations
passed
in
the
treasury
department,
and
customs
got
together
and
proposed
some
regulations.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
that
is
our
position.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
yes
sir.
now…
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
under
the
present
situation
it
would
appear
that
would
be
true,
if
that
power
existed,
and
we
are
not
conceding
it
does
exist,
your
honor.
now,
in
so
far
as
the
court
of
appeals,
judge
mcgowan
joined
by
judge
kahn…
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
that
is
correct.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
i
do
not
think
it
probably
comes
within
this
statute,
there
are
probably
some
regulations
that
allow
for
the
opening
of
that.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
but
the
regulation
really
does
not
limit
or
confine
or
upset
the
opening
of
these
packages
as
we
see
it,
but
they
cannot
expand
the
right
to
open
the
first
class
letter
mail…
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
the
letters,
if
you
want
to
see
the
letters
that
were
involved
to
the
envelopes,
there
are
polo
photographs
taken
by
the
fbi,
exhibits
on
appeal
that
can
be
clearly
seen
in
this
case.
now,
the
government
and
the
court
below
was
concerned
about
the
invasion
of
privacy,
right
of
free
expression.
now,
the
government
by
its
own
figures
indicate
that
85%
of
the
time
or
approximate
thereto,
this
mail
is
open,
nothing
dutiable
or
prohibited
is
found,
the
customs
agent
is
an
error
85%
of
the
time,
he
finds
nothing
of
a
prohibited
or
dutiable
nature.
then
the
envelope
is
stamped
and
sent
to
the
individuals.
now,
we
suggest
that
that
severely
limits,
inhibits,
the
freedom
of
expression,
it
tends
to
chill
expression.
now,
the
government
said,
well,
they
really
do
not
read
it,
there
is
a
regulation
to
that
effect.
i
think
the
short
answer
to
that
can
be
found
in
this
court’s
opinion
in
wolff
v.
mcdonnell,
418
us
of
page
539.
in
that
case,
letters,
attorney
client
letters
were
sent
into
the
jail,
was
claim
as
violated,
first
amendment
rights,
shield
the
expression
thereof.
this
court
held
that,
that
regulation
was
all
right,
because
the
inmate
was
required
to
be
present
at
the
time.
this
court
said,
“neither
could
it
chill
such
communications
since
the
inmate’s
presence
ensures
that
prison
officials
will
not
read
the
mail”.
by
inference
we
can
assume
that,
if
the
inmate
was
not
there
to
insure
that,
serious
questions
of
chilling
that
communication
would
exist.
now,
that
is
in
the
context
of
a
totalitarian
environment,
individuals
locked
up.
now,
in
a
free-society
can
expect
no
less,
that
when
its
mail
is
opened
there
are
some
safeguards
to
ensure
that
the
petty
officials,
this
customs
officers,
we
are
not
left
to
there
whim
and
discretion
to
open
these
mail.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
no,
your
honor,
i
think
if
i
am
receiving
mail
from
overseas,
i
received
a
letter
not
too
long
ago
from
england,
from
a
friend
who
wrote
to
me,
i
think
i
have
the
same
right
of
privacy
that
inheres
and
that
communication
to
me,
and
a
petty
customs
official,
i
do
not
believe,
should
have
the
right
to
open
that
mail
at
his
discretion
and
whim.
he
is
wrong
85%
of
the
time.
no
one
is
there
to
see,
to
ensure,
that
he
does
not
read
it,
as
this
court
required
in
wolff,
and
i
think
that
is
the
chilling
effect
on
the
opening
of
our
correspondence.
this
case
concerns
not…
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
i
respectfully
dissent
from
your
honor’s
suggestion
for
this
reason.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
the
second
part.
for
the
first
195
years
or
thereabout
since
the
1971,
if
incoming
mail
was
suspect,
it
was
delivered
to
the
post
office
closes
to
the
addressee,
and
then
the
postal
people
notified
the
addressee
to
come
there.
the
very
same
presence
that
we
have
in
the
jail
situations,
so
i
find
no
difficulty,
we
find
no
undue
burden,
because
until
1971
that
practice
was
uniformly
followed
in
this
country.
until
1971
the
post
office
and
customs
people
got
together
and
promulgated
a
regulation
changing
that.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
that
is
quite
true,
your
honor,
but
as
we
know,
as
the
government
indicates,
that
they
open
it
when
they
think
it
concerns
something
in
addition
to
correspondence.
a
search
as
we
know
cannot
be
made
lawful
by
what
it
turns
up.
that
fact
that
it
contains
these
items
of
course…
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
in
a
particular
case,
speaking
of
the
nation
and
the
mail
as
a
whole,
i
think
the
hollowness
recedes
to
some
extent.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
i
think
in
the
--
perhaps
therein
particular
rights
and
the
particular
context
of
this
case
might
not
have
been
unduly
chilled.
there
was
no
extreme
frost
there
as
we
see
it,
but
in
any
event,
i
think
their
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
were
violated,
and
that
is
the
grapheme
of
the
complaint
that
we
have
in
this
court.
thank
you.
