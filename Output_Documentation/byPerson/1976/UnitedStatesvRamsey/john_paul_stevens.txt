john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
geller,
does
it
cover
mail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
language
covers
mail
in
482?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is
envelopes
carried
by
a
person
coming
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
statute
is
search
any
trunk
or
envelope
wherever
found,
in
which
you
may
have
a
reasonable
cause
to
suspect
there
is
merchandise
which
was
imported
contrary
to
the
law,
that
is
the
language
you
are
talking
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
statutory
authority
is
to
inspect
envelopes
in
which
there
is
reasonable
cause
to
believe
there
is
merchandise
in
contrary
to
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
a
different
standard
than
the
probable
cause
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
do
you
think
there
is
any
question
about
our
right
to
consider
the
statistical
material
you
have
submitted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
we
probably
do
not
need
to
look
at
them
if
that’s…
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
panzer,
while
you
pause,
i
might
ask
another
question.
we
have
all
sort
of
assumed
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
packages
and
smaller
letters.
the
court
of
appeals
does
too.
in
your
view,
in
the
footnote
that
judge
mcgowan
has,
footnote
eight,
what
he
described,
what
he
might
suggest
what
would
establish
probable
cause
to
open
a
letter
or
an
envelope.
in
your
view,
would
the
envelopes
that
where
involved
in
this
case,
and
were
opened,
the
ones
with
42
grams
in
weight
and
so
forth,
would
there
have
been
probable
cause
to
open
those
under
judge
mcgowan’s
footnote
eight,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
would
say
no?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
panzer,
to
whom
should
that
showing
be
made,
it
sounds
like
a
legislative
determination
to
me
that
you
described?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn’t
the
reason
nobody
questioned
it,
because
the
government
did
not
do
anything?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
took
it
to
the
man
and
said,
will
you
give
me
your
consent,
and
if
he
said
no,
they
would
not
open
it,
so
he
did
not
have
the
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
talking
about
envelopes,
thought.
do
you
say
nobody
has
ever
questioned
the
authority
on
packages
either?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
