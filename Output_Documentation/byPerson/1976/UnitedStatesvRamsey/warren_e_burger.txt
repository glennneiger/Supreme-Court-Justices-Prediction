chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
167,
united
states
v.
ramsey.
mr.
geller,
i
think
you
may
proceed
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
the
size
of
the
envelope.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
it
would
depend
in
fact
on
what
was
in
them
to
determine
how
big
the
package
was.
i
took
the
question
to
be
how
big
was
the
package;
did
it
have
one
sheet
of
paper
in
it,
or
did
it
have
something
more
than
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
answer
the
question
in
terms
of
ounces
or
grams?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
when
you
get
off
the
airplane
at
any
international
airport,
or
when
you
are
about
to
get
off,
does
the
government
need
probable
cause
to
support
the
search
of
your
suitcase
and
your
briefcase
and
your
pockets?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
at
the
airport
when
you
get
off
the
plane,
they
have
to
have
any
statute,
any
standard
of
reasonableness
to
open
your
briefcase
and
your
suitcase
and
go
through
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
united
states
government
can
stop
and
inspect
anything
crossing
its
borders,
can
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
an
inherent
power
of
sovereignty.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
the
mexican
border,
for
example,
they
can
virtually
take
a
car
apart
and
inspect
it.
now,
we
have
held
that
after
it
gets
away
from
the
border,
you
need
something
more,
and
in
some
cases
it
has
been
indicated
when
the
car
is
riding
six
inches
lower
that
it
would
normally
ride,
that
affords
some
grounds
to
believe
that
maybe
it
has
some
people
or
some
substances
in
the
car.
but
at
the
border,
is
anything
required
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
only
reason
they
spot-check
them
is
they
have
not
got
the
manpower
and
the
time
to
check
every
one,
but
do
they
not
have
the
sovereign
power
to
open
every
bag,
every
briefcase,
and
go
into
every
pocket
of
every
person
that
is
coming
across
the
borders
into
this
country,
without
any
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
why
are
we
worrying
about
this
statutes
except
that
it
allocates
the
functions
among
different
people.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
if
i
recall
the
so-called
strip
or
skin
searches,
which
are
performed
at
the
borders
sometimes,
those
have
required
higher
standard
than
mere
caprice
and
spot-check,
have
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
palmer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
maybe
he
did
not
know
about
this
statute
that
appears
on
the
appendix
of
the
government’s
petition
for
search,
presiding
and
to
search
any
trunk
or
envelope
wherever
found,
in
which
he
may
have
reasonable
cause
to
suspect
and
so
forth,
maybe
he
did
not
know
about
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
he
did
not
know
about
it
then
he
was
disagreeing
with
this
statute,
was
not
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
other
alternative;
either
that
he
didn’t
know
about
it,
or
he
did
not
agree
with
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
did
not
think
envelope
in
the
mail.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
palmer.
mr.
panzer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
cases
where
the
opening
of
the
envelope
disclosed
pornographic
pictures,
we
had
that
just
two
or
three
years
ago.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
you
say
that
there
is
a
probable
cause
standard
at
the
border
itself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
at
the
border,
question
is
whether
the
person
or
the
thing
is
going
to
be
admitted
into
the
country,
is
it
not?
isn’t
that
the…
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
the
whole
enterprise
of
having
border
guards
and
all
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
are
not
yet
admitted
when
they
are
being
examined,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
open
his
briefcase,
his
trunk?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
also
have
the
alternative
there
mr.
panzer
of
being
able
to
simply
detain
them
at
the
border,
and
not
open
their
stuff,
if
the
rationale
is
simply
escape
of
capture.
can’t
you
simply
tell
them
you
come
over
here
and
stay
24
hours,
and
we
are
going
to
go
get
a
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
not
he
say
as
to
at
least
one
of
them
that
he
thought
there
was
something
like
sugar,
powdered
sugar
or
something
like
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
tended
to
respond
to
the
law
of
gravity
when
he
tipped
it
to
one
end
and
the
material
went
to
the
far
end
of
the,
something
along
that
line.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
you
have
two
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
