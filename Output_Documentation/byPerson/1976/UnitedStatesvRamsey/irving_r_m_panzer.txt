mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
is
important
to
realize
first,
that
this
is
the
first
time
in
this
court’s
history
that
not
only
this
question,
but
apparently
any
question
of
the
search
and
seizure
power
at
the
border,
with
regard
to
goods
or
letters
has
ever
come
before
this
court.
much
has
been
said
about
carroll
v.
the
united
states,
that
was
a
1924
case;
that
case,
that
quotation,
is
pure
dictum.
you
may
recall
that
in
that
case,
it
was
a
prohibition
case,
a
moving
automobile,
apparently
carrying
liquor,
moving
between
detroit
and
grand
rapids,
the
only
question
in
the
case,
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
border,
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
customs,
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
letters,
the
only
question
in
that
case
was
whether
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
search
and
seizure.
but
in
the
context
of
the
opinion
it
is
true
that
the
quotation
read
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
made.
i
will
also
concede
that,
that
quotation
has
been
much
adverted
to
by
this
court,
i
do
not
want
to
deny
that.
but
this
court
has
never
held
that
there
is
a
border
search
exception,
as
it
has
been
describe
here
today,
not
once
in
its
history.
i
find
no
basis
in
this
court’s
opinion
for
saying
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
operate
at
the
border.
i
think
some
of
the
language
that
we
have
heard
here
this
afternoon
suggests
that.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
operate
at
a
certain
place
in
this
country.
i
do
think
that
the
way
this
court
has
approached
other
search
and
seizure
cases,
and
particularly
the
border
patrol
cases,
tells
us
that
when
we
look
at
a
case
like
this
we
use
a
discriminating
standard.
if
there
is
a
so-called
border
search
exception,
it
cannot
be
a
blunderbuss
exception
for
everything
that
crosses
the
border,
whether
there
is
a
need
for
it
or
not.
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court
would
sustain
a
position
like
that.
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
yes,
37
photographs.
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
well,
i
think
we
look
at
this
as
a
number
of
different
situations
at
the
border,
rather
than
say
that
everything
that
crosses
the
border,
whether
it
moves
or
not,
is
detainable
or
not,
is
subject
to
an
exception
from
the
entire
fourth
amendment.
for
example,
persons
crossing
the
border,
the
carroll
statement;
persons
are
mobile,
things
they
carry
with
them
are
mobile,
and
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say,
despite
what
counsel
for
the
government
has
said,
that
the
very
basis
of
that
doctrine
is
that
here
is
something
which
may
evade
capture
if
you
do
not
search
it
at
the
moment.
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
yes,
that
is
one
of
the…
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
yes
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
that
is
correct.
i
will
say
that
in
border
patrol
cases,
one
has
the
right
to
make
a
stop
to
ask
a
person
for
his
identity
papers
or
something
of
that
sort.
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
yes,
because
that
may
evade
capture
if
not
done
at
the
time.
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
no,
but
that
is
too
intrusive
and
too
offensive.
if
one
were
to
stop
and
detain
any
number
of
people
on
that
ground,
i
think
that
would
be
considered
offensive.
it
would
be
inconvenient.
i
do
not
believe
the
court
would
sustain
that.
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
it
is
my
view
that
he
could,
it
is
my
view
that
there
is
a
…
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
yes,
it
is
my
view
that
he
could.
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
yes,
my
view
is
that
he
can.
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
they
could
not.
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
in
the
mail.
i
think
that
we
have…
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
yes,
i
make
a
distinction
between
mail
and
--
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
in
the
form
of
a
letter?
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
no,
they
could
not,
if
that
is
regular
letter
mail,
they
could
not,
not
without
a
search
warrant.
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
i
see,
it
is
a
personal
delivery…
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
well,
i
think
mail
is
different.
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
yes,
it
is
the
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
i
do
not
think
we
have
an
expectation
of
privacy
if
we
carry
that
same
letter
with
us,
no.
if
we
send
it
by
mail,
i
think
we
do.
i
have
no
doubt
that
we
do.
there
is
the
same
expectation…
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
yes,
just
as
anything
else
i
have.
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
at
the
border,
i
do
not
have
that
expectation,
no.
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
no,
i
think
mail
when
sent
in
from
abroad
rises
to
a
wholly
different
level.
we
do
expect
that
that
will
be
private.
we
do
put
in
our
most
familiar
and
our
most
intimate
thoughts.
i
think
there
is
gulf
between
carrying
that
letter
with
you
and
sending
it
in
by
mail.
i
think
there
is
a
constitutional
gulf.
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
let
us
turn
to
another
point,
though.
surely
this
court
would
not
sweep
aside
an
entire
constitutional
provision
unless
a
need
were
shown.
now,
i
will
concede
the
need
for
the
traveler,
for
his
luggage,
i
will
concede
it
even
for
a
package,
because
there
were
no
first
amendments
rights
and
hearing
in
a
package.
but
there
is
no
need
that
can
be
shown
for
doing
such
with
a
letter.
a
letter
is
not
mobile,
a
letter
will
lie
there
until
you
have
time
to
go
and
get
a
warrant,
if
you
can
show
probable
cause.
a
letter
is
in
the
penumbra
of
the
first
amendment,
and…
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
a
letter
rises
to
first
amendment
levels
that
a
package
or
a
book
does
not,
in
my
opinion.
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
absolutely,
absolutely,
and
that
makes
the
difference,
because
--
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
i
do
not
--
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
yes,
that
does
not
rise
--
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
pardon?
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
well,
i
think
the
distinction
is
--
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
yes,
it
would,
and
that
brings
me
to
something
else.
the
government
says
if
you
want
to
be
sure
that
we
do
not
open
your
mail,
do
not
send
anything
bulky.
i
think
that
turns
the
fourth
amendment
on
its
head.
i
think
as
the
court
of
appeals
said,
if
the
government
wants
to
be
sure
it
is
not
invading
your
privacy,
let
them
go
and
get
a
search
warrant.
there
is
no
law
that
everybody
is
presumed
to
be
violating
the
law,
quite
the
contrary.
in
response
to
questions
that
were
put
here
before,
is
there
a
constitutional
right
to
receive,
is
it
only
the
sender,
is
it
the
addressee?
we
know
that
this
court
decided
in
lamont
v.
postmaster
general
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
receive
international
mail.
and
that
wasn’t
even
sealed
mail,
that
was
unsealed
mail.
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
receive
it.
that
right
inheres
in
the
addressee
and
not
in
the
sender,
although
the
sender
may
have
rights
too.
but
it
inheres
in
the
respondents
before
the
court
this
morning.
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
i
recognize
that
he
comes
very
close
to
suggesting
that
there
is
probable
cause,
but
i
must
disagree
with
that.
the
mere
fact
that
a
letter
is
bulky
and
comes
from
a
suspected
country
is
not
in
my
opinion
probable
cause,
no.
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
i
would
say
no.
incidentally,
if
the
court
would
like
to
see
the
size,
the
very
size
of
the
letters
we
are
talking
about,
i
have
prepared
these.
five
of
the
six
letters
were
this
size,
which
is
just
an
ordinary
common
size
envelope,
and
the
sixth
was
this
size,
which
is
something
like
a
christmas
card,
large
christmas
card.
it
is
important
to
realize,
if
the
inspector
said
that
this
were
letters,
he
did
not
think
these
were
packages.
he
did
not
think
they
contained
anything
but
letter
type
mail.
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
well,
that
is
true,
he
said
that
there
was
something
else
in
there.
but
in
response
to
a
question,
do
you
think
these
were
letters,
he
said…
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
no,
he
did
not
say
that,
your
honor,
he
said
that
he
often
makes
that
test
but
could
not
recall
whether
he
had
done
it
in
this
case.
all
that
the
record
reveals
for
his
cause
in
this
case
was
that
the
letters
came
from
thailand
and
were
bulky,
nothing
else.
i
do
not
think
that
rises
to
probable
cause,
your
honor.
counsel
for
the
government
told
you
that
they
do
not
rely
upon
the
statistics
in
their
brief,
and
that
is
interesting,
because
they
attempted
in
effect
to
intimidate
the
court
by
telling
you
that
a
billion
envelopes
come
in
every
year.
they
only
have
a
handful
of
inspectors.
they
can
only
do
so
much
work
a
day.
if
you
do
not
give
them
this
power,
if
you
do
not
exempt
an
entire
category,
a
stupendous
category,
namely
all
international
mail,
if
you
do
not
exempt
this
from
the
fourth
amendment,
we
are
going
be
overwhelmed.
now,
they
told
you
these
in
almeida-sanchez
about
illegal
aliens.
they
told
you
this
in
united
states
district
court
about
the
national
security,
and
they
have
told
you
this
in
case
after
case.
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
the
problem
was
not
at
all
that
difficult,
and
i
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
the
burden
is
upon
the
government
to
say
to
this
court
that
there
is
no
other
way
to
do
this.
now,
if
they
could
tell
you
that,
perhaps
i
would
reconsider.
but
i
think
if
we
can
think
of
some
other
way
to
protect
the
government’s
interest,
then
you
ought
not
to
exempt
a
stupendous
category
of
mail
entirely
from
the
fourth
amendment.
are
there
other
ways
to
do
it?
probably
there
are.
judge
mcgowan
and
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
a
number
of
different
ways.
one
was
the
oral
testimony
of
the
agent
to
the
magistrate,
which
if
made
upon
a
record,
i
take
it
if
recorded,
would
satisfy
constitutional
requirements.
he
said
if
the
problem
was
large
enough
you
could
station
a
magistrate
at
kennedy
airport,
or
wherever
else
the
problem
existed.
there
are
other
solutions
perhaps.
we
recall
that
in
almeida-sanchez…
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
it
is
a
distance.
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
well,
the
government
has
a
deep
pocket.
but
if
they
wanted
to
station
a
magistrate
at
kennedy
airport,
that
would
solve
the
problem.
another
possible
solution;
akin
to
the
one
in
58:12
camara
v.
superior
court,
and
like
the
one
that
mr.
justice
powell
suggested
when
he
concurred
in
almeida-sanchez,
a
type
of
area
warrant.
now,
in
camara,
it
was
an
area
warrant
for
certain
houses.
in
almeida-sanchez,
it
was
suggested
that
perhaps
if
certain
roads
were
well
traveled,
well
suspected
to
be
used
by
illegal
aliens,
that
a
warrant
would
lie
for
those.
well,
i
suggest
that
here,
if
the
government
can
show
that
a
certain
country
or
a
certain
place
in
a
country,
certain
types
of
letters,
certain
handwriting,
certain
typewriting,
whatever
it
maybe,
if
the
government
can
show
that,
that
perhaps
a
type
of
warrant
would
lie
for
that.
mr.
irving
r.
m.
panzer
no,
i
think
it
could
be
made
to
a
magistrate.
if
the
area
warrant
could
lie
in
camara,
and
if
the
alien
warrant
could
lie
on
almeida-sanchez,
i
do
not
see
why
this
would
not
lie.
if
you
cannot
make
that,
then
you
cannot
prove
probable
cause,
and
i
do
not
think
you
should
have
the
right
to
open
envelopes.
