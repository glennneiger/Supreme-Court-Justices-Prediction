unknown
speaker
but
there
is
no
statute
that
covers
the
airport
and
the
ships
that
are
coming
in,
they
just
do
that.
unknown
speaker
there
is
some
risk
then
i
suppose
that
a
customs
inspector
might
think
an
envelope
contained
currency,
in
fact
when
he
opened
it
up
it
would
contain
a
letter.
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
do
you
think
that
the
drive
against
narcotics
was
impart
responsible
for
the
1971
change?
unknown
speaker
this
is
what
i
asked,
and
i
am
wondering
why
the
1971
change?
unknown
speaker
let
me
read
you
this
language
from
page
154,
the
carroll
case,
and
ask
you
if
you
think
it
is
consistent
with
the
explanation
that
you
just
gave.
this
is
page
154
of
267
us.
“travelers
maybe
so
stopped
in
crossing
an
international
boundary,
because
of
national
self
protection,
reasonably
requiring
one
entering
the
country
to
identify
himself
as
entitled
to
come
in
and
his
belongings
as
effect
which
may
lawfully
be
brought
in”.
i
myself
do
not
get
any
sense
that
disappearance
out
of
that
language.
unknown
speaker
well,
my
point
is
that
it
seems
to
me
the
justification
offered
for
the
border
search
in
carroll
is
quite
different
than
the
justification
offered
for
the
search
of
the
automobile.
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
think
in,
if
you
note
at
the
moment,
in
the
sequence
of
the
passage
of
these
various
provisions,
at
what
stage
did
this
language
come
in?
customs
employees
have
responsibility
for
resealing
or
repacking
mail
of
foreign
origin
following
customs
examinations.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
know
at
what
stage
that
came
in,
in
terms
of
the
sequence,
you
were
speaking
of
the
1866
statute
and…
unknown
speaker
mr.
palmer,
what
will
happen
if
the
government
had
just
held
the
letters?
unknown
speaker
just
held
it
forever?
unknown
speaker
just
held
it
forever,
who
could
complain?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
addressor?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
people
come
up
from
thailand
and
object?
unknown
speaker
so
if
they
just
held
it,
you
know
and
i
know
that
the
people
would
not
have
come
for
it.
unknown
speaker
so
everything
would
have
been
fine.
unknown
speaker
everything
would
have
been
all
right.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
agree
that
inherent
in
any
government,
in
any
country,
is
the
right
to
protect
its
borders?
unknown
speaker
in
any
way
it
sees
fit.
unknown
speaker
in
any
way
it
sees
fit.
unknown
speaker
the
limitation
comes
from
where?
unknown
speaker
where
does
the
limitation
come
from?
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
congress
can
limit
its
own
--
the
power
of
the
government,
can
it
not?
unknown
speaker
where
did
you
get
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
palmer?
unknown
speaker
i
interrupt
you
a
great
deal,
may
i
just
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
you
say
that
the
statute
quoted
on
the
top
of
appendix
(a)
the
1866
statute,
cannot
properly
be
construed
to
authorize
opening
a
mail.
unknown
speaker
and
is
it
your
submission
therefore
that
there
is
no
statutory
authority
for
the
government
opening
letter
class
mail?
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
no
statutory
authority?
unknown
speaker
that
is
your
position.
unknown
speaker
and
then
your
position
in
addition
would
have
to
be
that
it
takes
for
that
position
to
have
any
meaning,
would
be
that
statutory
authority
is
required
before
the
government
may
open
letter
class
mail,
i
think?
unknown
speaker
mr.
palmer,
i
need
to
interrupt
again,
but
on
the
statuary
point,
your
argument
is,
as
i
understand,
the
word
envelope
means
an
envelope
brought
in
by
the
traveler
as
he
returns
to
the
country
or
some
--
is
that…
unknown
speaker
if
that
is
correct,
what
about
statutory
authority
for
parcels
sent
through
the
mail,
is
there
any
statutory
authority
for
that?
you
seem
to
concede,
as
i
remember
your
brief,
that
there
is
--
that,
that
maybe
opened,
there
is
a
long
practice
of
doing
it,
is
that
within
the
statute
or
on
some
other
statutory
basis?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
there
regulations
that
allow
for
the
opening
of
this,
of
letter
class
mail?
unknown
speaker
it
is
your
argument,
i
understand,
we
all
understand
it,
it
is
a
constitutional
argument,
but
i
just
want
to
be
sure
that
your
claim
is
that
there
is
no
statutory
authority
for
this.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
there
is
some
difference
between
domestic
mail
between
a
lawyer
and
his
client,
who
is
in
prison,
and
mail
that
is
coming
in
from
a
foreign
country
that
must
pass
through
the
customs
inspection?
unknown
speaker
this
could
be
a
little
easier,
a
good
deal
easier
isn’t
it
for
us
to
say
that
the
mail
going
into
a
prison
can
have
the
prisoner
on
hand
within
a
few
minutes
to
be
present,
whereas
you
cannot
do
that
with
all
the
incoming
foreign
mail,
can
you?
unknown
speaker
oh,
which
part
of
my
suggestion,
that
you
cannot
get
them
there
in
a
few
minutes?
unknown
speaker
for
what
it
is
worth
of
course,
your
client’s
correspondence
such
in
quotations
was
nonexistent,
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
no
writing
in
its
envelope.
unknown
speaker
i
said
for
what
it
is
worth,
these
are
little
hollow
sound
when
you
are
talking
about
first
amendments
rights
with
your
particular
clients.
unknown
speaker
i
also
concede
that
both
mr.
ramsey’s
and
mr.
kelly’s
rights
have
been
chilled,
i
must
agree
to
that
too.
unknown
speaker
what
if
i
wrote
poems
to
my
wife?
unknown
speaker
what
about
that?
unknown
speaker
how
many
pages
does
it
have
to
be
before
it
loses
its
protection?
