justice
thurgood
marshall
it
covers
airport?
justice
thurgood
marshall
don’t
they
have
rule
now
about
spot-checking
two
or
three
bags,
it
is
more
reasonable,
is
not
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
i
see,
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
they
do
with
the
letter?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
happens
to
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
has
to
be
stamped?
justice
thurgood
marshall
sometimes
you
see
something,
you
wonder
what
happened
to
the
letter?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
stamped
and
opened?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
far,
as
my
right
of
privacy,
i
do
not
think
it
has
anything
to
do
with
whether
you
read
it
in
court
or
not,
i
do
not
think
you
have
any
right
to
read
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
somebody
comes
in
with
eight
envelopes
in
his
suitcase,
and
the
customs
agent
opens
it
up,
could
he
open
those
envelopes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright,
now
he
has
them
in
his
pocket,
could
he
open
them
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
had
them
in
his
hands,
could
he
open
them
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
send
them
ahead,
could
he
open
them
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
difference
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mail,
it
is
in
the
mail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
in
the
airplane.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
ai
eight
letters
on
an
airplane
and
agreed
to
deliver
it
in
new
york,
could
they
take
those
off?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
not
mailed,
they
just
gave
the
eight
letters
and
said
deliver
them
to
kennedy
airport.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
think
customs
would
take
them
off,
i
have
got
news
for
you.
they
would,
but
i
mean
why
is
mail
so
magic?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
the
privacy
what
you
are
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
is
private
if
it
is
in
his
possession,
as
if
it
is
in
the
mail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
right
now,
if
you
walk
around
the
street
with
envelope
in
your
pocket,
do
not
you
have
the
right
to
think
that,
that
will
be
private?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
will
not
change
when
you
cross
the
border.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
is
the
same
with
mail,
isn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
might
go
along
with
you
if
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
write
a
nice
letter,
but
i
get
in
trouble
with
if
the
guy
is
choosing
to
right
the
mail
51:34.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
pages
does
it
have
to
be
before
it
loses
its
protection?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
if
the
letter
weighed
five
ounces,
would
that
still
be
protected?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
know
how
far
kennedy
airport
is
from
foley
square
were
the
federal
court
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
about
$10
in
taxi
fare.
