mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
probable
cause
in
a
search
warrant
are
required
before
customs
officials
may
open
an
envelope
mailed
into
the
united
states
from
abroad,
when
they
have
reason
to
suspect
that
the
envelope
may
contain
contrabands
or
dutiable
goods.
in
our
view,
such
custom
searches
of
international
mail
at
the
border
of
our
country
are
reasonable
in
the
absence
of
probable
cause
or
a
warrant.
we
submit
that
this
position
is
supported
by
the
backgrounds
of
the
fourth
amendment,
by
nearly
200
years
of
american
history,
and
by
the
repeated
and
consistent
pronouncements
of
this
court
and
of
every
other
court
to
have
considered
the
question,
save
one.
the
one
exemption
is
the
court
below,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
which
held
by
a
vote
of
two
to
one,
that
the
fourth
amendment
prohibits
customs
inspections
of
what
it
termed,
letter
mail,
entering
this
country
from
overseas,
unless
the
government
first
obtains
a
search
warrant
issued
upon
probable
cause.
the
facts
released
on
february
4th,
1974,
george
kallnischkies,
a
customs
inspector
at
the
general
post
office
in
new
york
came
across
eight
envelopes
that
had
been
mailed
from
thailand
to
four
different
places
in
the
washington
d.c.
area.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
envelopes,
mr.
justices
blackmun,
were
8.5x4.25
inches
and
6.75x4.75
inches,
they
are
normal
sized
envelopes
used
in
domestic
and
international
mail.
the
envelopes
immediately…
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
it
had
more
than
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
envelopes
immediately
attracted
officer
kallnischkies’
attention
not
because…
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
officer
kallnischkies
weighed
the
envelopes
because
they
seemed
rather
unusually
bulky
and
large,
and
he
determined
that
they
weighed
42
grams,
which
is
about
an
ounce-and-a-half.
although
an
ordinary
airmail
envelope
of
that
size
generally
weighs
about
7-14
grams.
so
they
were
substantially
heavier
than
a
normal
size
envelope,
normal
envelope
of
that
size.
now,
other
things
attracted
officer
kallnischkies’
attention
and
gave
him
reason
to
suspect
these
envelopes.
first,
they
were
from
thailand,
which
is
a
notorious
source
of
narcotics.
and
second,
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
earlier,
they
were
rather
bulky
in
appearance,
and
when
he
felt
them
they
clearly
felt
as
if
they
contained
something
other
than
or
an
addition
to
correspondence
inside
of
them.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
court
of
appeals
in
an
obscure
footnote
hinted
that
there
might
well
be
--
have
been
probable
cause
there.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
we
hesitate
to
disagree…
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
our
position
is
that
probable
cause
is
not
necessary,
and
our
position
in
addition
is
that,
using
the
standards
of
probable
cause…
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
if
your
honor’s
determine
that
a
warrant
requirement
should
not
be
imposed
on
border
searches,
but
that
a
probable
cause
requirement
may
or
may
not
be
necessary,
i
think
you
would
have
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
based
upon
the
court
of
appeals
apparent
conclusion
that
there
was
probable
cause
here.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
we
hesitate,
as
i
said,
to
take
issue
with
that
because
it
is
favorable
to
the
government,
but
we
think
using
the
standards
developed
for
probable
cause
in
domestic
searches,
that
it
is
hard
to
say
that
officer
kallnischkies
has
had
probable
cause
here.
all
that
he
knew
is
that
this
envelope
had
come
in
from
overseas,
and
that
it
was
bulky;
it
seemed
to
contain
something
other
than
or
addition
to
correspondence.
now,
i
do
not
know
if
that
would
give
a
reasonable
person…
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
our
position
is
that
it
is
difficult
to
conclude
that
there
was
probable
cause
here,
as
that
standard
has
been
determined
for
domestic
searches.
because
i
do
not
think
that
a
reasonable
person
could
have
concluded
merely
from
the
fact
that
a
bulky
envelope
that
is
coming
in
from
overseas,
that
a
law
was
being
violated,
that
something
was
in
there
that
was
evidence
of
a
crime.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
does
not
mr.
chief
justice.
the
statutory
authority
for
custom
searches,
which
is
19
u.s.c.
§
482,
requires
only
that
government
have
reason
to
suspect
that
your
luggage,
or
you,
or
an
automobile
if
you
are
driving
an
automobile,
or
a
chattel
that
you
are
carrying,
may
contain
contraband
or
dutiable
articles.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
i
think
19
u.s.c.
§
482
is
one
statute,
and
there
are
other
basis…
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
cover
every
--
that
is
right,
every
entry
into
our
country,
either
at
airports
or
at
ports
or
at
the
land
borders
with
canada
and
mexico.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
believe
that
it
does.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
section
482
i
believe
says,
“envelopes
have
been
--
envelopes…
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
think
one
could
assume
that
the
envelopes
have
been
carried
by
somebody,
it
maybe
a
postal
clerk
as
he
brings
it
off
the
airplane,
the
envelopes
have
not
gotten
into
this
country
on
their
own.
our
position
is
that
section
482
of
title
19
covers
chattels
of
every
description,
and
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
case
law
that
has
ever
suggested
otherwise
mr.
justice
stevens.
and
in
number
of
the
circuit
courts
have
had
occasion
to
consider
border
searches
of
envelopes
and
they
have
construed
section
482
to
cover
that
without
any
dissent.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
the
statutory
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
one…
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
believe
it
is,
i
believe
it
is
a
much
lower
standard.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
the
standard
would
be
one
of
reasonableness
under
the
fourth
amendment.
now…
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
think
federal
agents
have
to
have
statutory
authority
to
operate.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
correct.
we
believe
that
these
statutes
merely
allocate
the
responsibility
among
the
dea
or
the
custom
service,
which
agency
of
the
government
will
exercise
that
constitutionally
based
authority,
which
we
believe
every
sovereign
has
to
inspect
articles
coming
into
its
country.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
believe
that
the
standard
is
reasonableness,
and
that
is
the
constitutional
standard.
now,
there
are
also
statutory
standards
which
we
believe
the
government
has
to
comply
with.
the
statutory
standard
is
reason
to
suspect
that
contraband
or
dutiable
goods
maybe
being
brought
into
this
country.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
it
is
reasonable
to
spot-check
bags
in
an
effort…
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
believe
that
the
fact
that
something
is
coming…
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
after
congress
has
passed
statutes
that
may
limit
the
constitutional
authority
of
executive
branch
officials
to
carry
out
searches,
there
is
no
question
in
this
case,
i
might
add,
that
the
statute
was
violated.
the
question
here
is
solely
one
of
constitutional
law.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
fourth
amendment,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
imposes
a
requirement
of
reasonableness.
now,
in
our
view,
section
482
is
coterminous
with
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
believe
that
the
reasonableness
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment
would
apply
at
the
border,
but
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
border
search
that
would
not
be
reasonable
except
in
the
way
it
is
carried
out,
such
as
very
intrusive
search,
or
perhaps
a
body
cavity
search.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
think
that
there
is
a
requirement
of
reasonableness
imposed
in
the
fourth
amendment,
but
i
think
i
would
agree
with
the
thrust
of
your
honor’s
question
that
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
border
search
that
would
not
be
reasonable.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
might
be…
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
correct.
but
that
goes
to
the
manner
in
which
it
is
conducted
and
not
to
the
power
to
make
a
search.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
some
circuits
have
held
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
officer
kallnischkies
opened
the
envelope
and
found
in
it,
sandwiched
between
two
pieces
of
cardboard,
a
plastic
bag
containing
a
white
powdery
substance.
he
removed
the
sample,
field
tested
it,
and
determined
that
it
was
heroin.
the
envelope
from
which
the
heroin
was
taken
contained
no
correspondence.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
not
of
any
kind,
the
only
thing
that
was
in
the
envelope,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
was
some
cardboard
and
some
heroin.
kallnischkies
then
open
the
other
seven
envelopes,
which
also
appeared
to
be
bulky
and
to
contain
merchandise
and
which
appeared
to
have
been
typed
on
the
same
typewriter
as
the
first
envelope
he
opened,
and
these
seven
envelopes
also
contained
only
heroin
and
cardboard,
no
correspondence.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
they
all
come
from
thailand,
i
am
not
certain
of
the
way
in
which
the
postal
authorities
in
thailand
stamp
their
mail
so
it
could
be
determined
whether
it
came
from
the
same
post
office
address.
i
am
also
not
certain
whether
it
had
the
same
return
address,
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
it
clearly
all
came
from
thailand,
and
they
were
all
addressed
to…
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
correct,
i
believe.
the
envelopes
were
then
resealed
in
a
lap
pouch
and
were
send
to
washington,
where
they
were
opened
by
agents
of
the
drug
enforcement
administration.
a
controlled
delivery
was
then
arranged
for
the
six
of
the
envelopes.
the
dea
agents
observed
respondent
kelly
collect
the
envelopes,
meet
with
respondent
ramsey,
and
give
ramsey
a
brown
paper
bag.
respondents
were
then
arrested,
and
evidence
seized
insolent
to
these
arrests
eventually
led
to
their
conviction
on
a
variety
of
narcotics
offenses.
divided
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
these
convictions.
the
court
held
that
officer
kallnischkies’
opening
of
the
envelopes
in
the
absence
of
a
warrant
issued
upon
probable
cause
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
although
the
court
acknowledged
that
border
searches
have
traditionally
been
recognized
as
an
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement
to
the
fourth
amendment,
and
although
the
court
conceded
that
the
customs
agent
here
had
reason
to
suspect
that
the
envelopes
may
have
contained
merchandise
subject
to
duty
or
prohibited
from
entering
the
country,
it
nonetheless
concluded
that
the
border
search
exception
should
apply
only
to
packages
mailed
into
the
united
states
from
foreign
countries,
and
should
not
be
extended
to
so
called,
letter
mail,
such
as
it
believed
was
involved
in
this
case.
now,
we
believe
that
the
decision
below
is
wrong,
and
that
it
threatens
a
substantial
inroad
in
the
government’s
ability
to
detect
and
to
prevent
smuggling.
there
is,
as
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged,
an
established
border
search
power.
this
court
has
referred
many
times
to
the
legitimacy
of
that
power,
as
an
essential
means
of
protecting
our
nation’s
security
and
revenue,
and
inherent
right
of
any
sovereign
to
control
the
introduction
of
prohibited
or
dutiable
articles
into
its
territory.
such
searches
in
the
absence
of
probable
cause
or
a
warrant
had
repeatedly
been
held
to
be
reasonable
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment,
because
of
the
paramount
need
of
the
government
to
know
what
is
being
brought
into
this
country,
and
because
the
minimal
intrusion
which
the
search
entails
invades
areas
in
which
persons
have
at
best
only
a
minimal
expectation
of
privacy.
indeed
as
we
noted
in
our
brief,
the
very
congress
that
passed
and
adopted
the
fourth
amendment
also
enacted
a
statute
allowing
customs
officers
to
carry
out
warrantless
border
searchers
whenever
they
had
reason
to
suspect
that
goods,
wares,
and
merchandise
subject
to
duty
were
being
concealed.
now,
this
border
search
power,
as
the
court
of
appeals
agreed,
and
as
we
do
not
understand
respondents
to
contest,
allows
customs
officials
to
search
people,
luggage,
automobile,
chattels
of
every
description,
and
mailed
packages
without
probable
cause
or
a
search
warrant
as
they
seek
to
enter
the
united
states.
this
being
so,
we
can
perceive
no
reason
or
justification
to
carve
out
an
exception
for
so-called
letter
mail
entering
this
country.
this
court…
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
certainly
mr.
justice
blackmun.
almost
a
century
ago
in
cotzhausen
v.
nazro
in
107
us,
this
court
observed
that
our
customs
laws
and
border
search
powers
would
be
meaningless
if,
and
i
am
quoting
now,
“if
the
mail
is
to
be
left
on
watched
and
all
its
sealed
contents
would
be
exempt
from
seizure”.
and
as
this
case
graphically
illustrates,
small
sealed
envelopes,
equally
as
well
as
a
suitcase
or
a
package,
may
conceal
merchandise
which
congress
has
decided
may
not
be
brought
into
the
united
states
or
may
enter
only
upon
payment
to
the
duty.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
while
it
was
reasonable
to
make
a
border
search
of
mailed
packages
without
a
warrant
or
probable
cause,
it
was
unreasonable
to
make
a
similar
search
of
envelopes,
sent
as
letter
class
mail.
it
provided
a
number
of
reasons
for
its
attempt
to
distinguish
between
envelopes
and
packages
in
the
mail.
we
think
that
none
of
these
reasons
can
withstand
analysis.
some
of
them
can
be
disposed
of
rather
quickly.
the
court
of
appeals
thought
first,
that
the
border
search
exception
was
grounded
in
the
notion
of
exigent
circumstances.
it
would
said
the
court
be
too
difficult
to
obtain
a
warrant
when
the
subject
of
the
border
search
is
mobile,
such
as
a
car
or
a
person.
but
the
court
thought
this
rationale
was
somehow
inapplicable
to
letter
mail,
which
it
said
can
easily
be
detained
while
a
warrant
is
sought.
so
i
have
already
noted
however,
border
searchers
do
not
depend
for
their
reasonableness
upon
any
notion
of
exigent
circumstances.
they
have
their
own
practical
and
historical
footing,
and
this
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
while
the
presence
of
exigent
circumstances
has
traditionally
been
held
only
to
excuse
the
failure
to
obtain
a
warrant,
the
border
search
is
an
exception
not
only
to
the
warrant
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment,
but
also
to
the
probable
cause
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
would
also
add
that
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
is
even
internally
inconsistent
on
this
point.
since
it
will
allow
the
opening
of
mailed
packages
on
to
the
border
search
exception,
even
though
such
packages,
just
like
envelopes,
could
be
detained
while
a
warrant
is
sought.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
also
thought
that
there
was
no
great
need
to
allow
routine
border
searches
of
letter-sized
envelopes
because
unlike
packages
or
suitcases,
there
are
limited
kinds
of
materials
that
could
be
concealed
inside
such
envelopes.
again,
we
think
the
court’s
objection
totally
misses
the
mark.
while
it
is
of
course
true
that
envelopes
cannot
be
used
to
transport
certain
types
of
merchandise,
because
by
law
a
letter
class
mail
cannot
be
larger
than
24x36
inches
and
cannot
weight
more
than
4
pounds
or
60
pounds,
if
it
is
from
canada,
these
envelopes
are
an
extremely
effective
means
of
transporting
other
types
of
merchandise,
especially
drugs
and
pornography,
which
need
only
be
brought
into
the
united
state
a
small
quantity
at
a
time
to
be
of
substantial
value.
the
statistics
we
have
reproduced
at
appendix
b
of
our
brief
bear
this
out,
because
they
show
that
the
number
of
seizures
of
these
prohibited
articles
from
letter
class
mail
dwarfs
the
amount
found
in
package
mail
coming
from
overseas.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
do
not,
mr.
justice
stevens,
this
was
the
subject,
as
the
court
will
recall,
of
a
motion
to
strike
that
the
respondent’s
made.
we
filed
a
memorandum
in
opposition
to
that
motion
to
strike
in
january,
and
the
court
denied
the
motion.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
our
memorandum
in
that
regard,
if
it
has
any
qualms,
but
we
think
that
the
reasonableness
of
the
border
search
power
in
this
case
does
not
depend
in
anyway
upon
the
reliability
of
those
statistics.
but
i
would
add
that
we
think
that
those…
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
that
is
correct,
and
we
only
provided
them
because
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
time
made
certain
what
we
thought
unfounded
assertions
about
how
easy
it
would
be
for
the
government
to
comply
with
the
requirements
that
they
were
setting
up
in
their
opinion,
and
it
was
only
to
combat
that
assertion
that
we
provided
these
statistics.
we
think
the
statistics
are
reliable.
we
have
explained
in
our
brief
and
in
our
memorandum
how
they
were
arrived
at.
i
would
add
in
addition
to
that,
this
is
not
an
unusual
procedure;
we
frequently
supply
this
court
with
the
best
available
statistics
that
the
executive
branch
has
when
we
think
it
might
be
helpful
to
this
court’s
resolution.
but
as
i
said
at
the
outset
mr.
justice
stevens,
we
think
that
the
border
search
power
that
was
exercised
in
this
case
was
reasonable
under
the
historic
and
traditional
footings,
regardless
of
whether
you
accept
the
reliability
of
our
statistics.
now,
the
single
factor
that
most
influenced
the
court
of
appeals’
decision
was
the
notion
that
letter
mail
may
contain
correspondence,
whereas
package
mail
does
not.
the
court
thought,
and
i
am
quoting
now
from
page
11(a)
of
the
appendix
to
our
petition.
“the
mere
knowledge
on
the
part
of
individuals
of
the
practice
of
routinely
opening
letter
mail
inhibits
the
exercise
of
free
speech”.
“we
submit
that
there
is
nothing
to
this
concern
on
the
part
of
the
court
appeals”.
first,
and
i
cannot
emphasize
this
point
too
strongly,
customs
officers
are
prohibited
from
reading
correspondence.
although
the
court
of
appeals
sprinkled
its
opinion
with
references
to
the
practice
of
routinely
opening
letters,
there
is
absolutely
no
routine
practice
by
the
customs
service
of
opening
envelopes
containing
written
matter.
the
authority
of
customs
officials
to
open
international
mail
is
strictly
limited
by
law
to
envelopes
that
they
have
reason
to
believe
may
contain
merchandise.
beyond
that,
if
an
envelope
that
appears
to
contain
merchandise
is
opened
for
a
customs
inspection,
and
it
is
found
to
contain
not
only
goods
but
also
correspondence,
customs
officials
similarly
are
prohibited
by
law
from
reading
the
correspondence.
there
is
a
specific
customs
regulation
that
covers
these
situations.
19
cfr
§
145.3,
which
is
reprinted
at
page
2(a)
of
our
brief
states
that,
“no
customs
officer
or
employee
shall
read
or
authorize
or
allow
any
other
person
to
read
any
correspondence
contained
in
sealed
letter
mail
of
foreign
origin
unless
a
warrant
is
obtained.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
they
do
not
read
it
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
any
envelope
that
is
opened,
the
stamp
is
having
been
opened,
and
then
it
is
sent
on
its
way
if
21:41
excepted.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
is
stamped
under
the
customs
procedures.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
current
customs
procedure
after
an
envelope
is
opened
is
to
stamp
the
envelope.
if
there
is
nothing
subject
to
seizure
on
the
envelope,
the
envelope
is
resealed
and
it
is
sent
on
its
way.
if
a
letter
is
found
in
there,
it
is
left
untouched,
it
is
certainly
not
read.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
is
stamped
that
has
been
opened,
that
is
correct,
and
i
think
they
put
the
date
and
time
on
it
in
addition.
now,
in
light
of
the
provisions
i
have
just
outlined,
we
contend
that
there
is
no
justifiable
reason
to
promulgate
a
broad
rule
prohibiting
warrantless
customs
inspections
of
letter
class
envelopes,
for
fear
of
the
chilling
effect
on
freedom
of
expression.
the
customs
statute
is
not
intended
to
restrict
or
to
inhibit
freedom
of
expression,
and
people
who
desire
not
to
have
their
international
mail
opened
at
the
border
can
easily
avoid
that
result
simply
by
not
sending
their
letters
in
envelopes
so
bulky
that
they
appear
to
contain
something
other
than
correspondence.
for
example,
they
may
use
an
aerogram,
which
is
frequently
used
in
international
mail;
it
is
a
thin
piece
of
onionskin
type
paper,
folded
into
the
form
of
an
envelope.
it
is
clear
that
those
aerograms
contain
nothing
but
correspondence
in
the
normal
case,
and
they
are
not
opened
because
customs
officials
have
no
reason
to
open
them.
they
could
not
possibly
have
reason
to
suspect
they
contain
prohibited
articles
or
contraband.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
in
this
case
to
suggest
that
such
mail
is
opened
by
customs
officials.
now,
there
may
in
fact
be
legitimate
privacy
interest
involved
whenever
an
envelope
is
opened,
even
one
coming
from
overseas.
but
we
believe
that
this
concerns
would
at
most
justify
a
rule
that
correspondence
seized
without
a
warrant
or
probable
cause,
or
fruits
derived
from
the
reading
of
such
correspondence
may
not
be
admitted
into
evidence.
a
rule
such
as
this
would
fully
satisfy
the
possible
invasions
of
privacy
that
troubled
the
court
of
appeals.
but
we
fail
to
understand
how
those
interests
are
protected
or
furthered
by
excluding
from
evidence,
merchandise
such
as
the
heroin
taken
from
the
envelopes
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
agree
mr.
justice
marshall,
and
current
customs
procedures
prevent
the
reading
of
correspondence
without
a
warrant.
now,
if
you
are
positing
a
situation
of
a
lawless
customs
officer
who
is
willing
to
violate
the
statutes
and
regulations,
i
do
not
think
that
person
would
be
deterred
by
an
exclusion
of
the
rules
since
he
is
not
reading
it
in
an
effort
to
uncover
evidence
that
would
later
be
introduced
in
court.
in
fact,
it
is
especially
difficult
to
fathom
why
an
exclusionary
rule
designed
to
protect
the
free
flow
of
information
should
be
imposed
here.
respondents
have
not
argued
that
their
correspondence
was
read
nor
could
they.
the
eight
envelopes
opened
by
officer
kallnischkies
contain
no
correspondence.
they
contain
nothing
but
cardboard
and
heroin.
and
whatever
inhibitory
effect
border
searches
of
international
mail
may
have
on
others,
respondents
were
not
exposed
to
it.
by
the
way,
i
should
at
this
point
clear
up
a
misconception
that
arises
several
times
throughout
respondent’s
briefs.
we
stated
in
our
brief
that
available
statistics
indicate
that
customs
officers
discovered
contraband
or
dutiable
goods
in
20%
of
the
international
letter
class
mail
that
they
open.
now,
respondents
conclude
from
this
statistic
that
nothing
but
correspondence
is
found
in
the
other
80%.
this
is
totally
incorrect.
most
of
the
80%
of
the
letter
class
envelopes
that
are
opened
and
do
not
contain
article
subject
to
seizure
are
found
to
contain
merchandise
that
for
one
reason
or
another
is
not
subject
to
a
duty.
for
example,
a
gift
under
$10.00
makes
up
a
large
percentage
of
these
letter
class
envelopes
that
are
opened.
very
few
of
the
letter
class
envelopes
that
are
opened,
there
is
nothing
but
correspondence
found,
and
this
is
of
course
what
we
would
expect
since
customs
officials
are
empowered
to
open
envelopes
only
if
they
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
envelope
may
contain
merchandise
subject
to
duty
or
imported
contrary
to
law.
now,
i
want
to
discuss
for
a
moment…
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
he
is
statute
and
regulations
free
to
open
any
envelope
if
he
has
reason
to
suspect
it
may
contain
contraband
and
dutiable
goods.
in
the
case
you
posit
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
assume
he
could
open
that
envelope,
but
unless
they
had
a
specific
tip
or
reason
to
suspect
that
something
like
currency
or
microfilm
might
be
included
in
a
very
thin
envelope,
under
current
customs
practice
those
envelopes
are
not
opened.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
it
was.
in…
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
obviously
the
amount
of
contraband
coming
into
this
country
begun
to
grow
and
grow
each
year
from
1924
to
1971.
in
addition,
in
the
late
1960s,
there
was
a
drive
to
cut
off
other
sources
of
smuggling.
we
intensified
our
efforts,
for
example,
at
the
mexican
border,
and
this
all
contributed
to
making
the
use
of
envelope
as
a
much
more
attractive
way
of
getting
contraband
into
this
country.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
mr.
justice
powell.
from
1924,
1924
was
the
first
time
under
the
universal
postal
convention
that
dutiable
articles
were
allowed
to
be
inserted
into
letter
class
mail,
before
that
you
could
not
do
that.
1924
until
1971,
when
a
piece
of
letter
class
mail
come
into
the
united
states
and
appeared
bulky
enough
to
contain
something
other
than
correspondence,
there
was
reason
to
suspect
it
contained
merchandise.
it
did
not
have
a
green
label
on
it,
if
it
had
a
green
label
that
would
have
been
a
consent
to
search
from
the
sender.
if
under
all
those
circumstances
a
letter
came
in,
the
addressee
was
notified
that
a
piece
of
mail
addressed
to
him
had
been
received,
and
that
there
was
reason
to
suspect
it
contained
merchandise,
subject
to
duty
or
contraband.
he
came
to
the
post
office
and
the
envelope
would
not
be
surrendered
to
him
unless
he
consented
to
have
the
custom
service
open
it,
and
that
was
the
practice
before
1971.
there
has
never
been
a
practice
of
delivering
these
bulky
letter
class
envelopes
without
opening
them.
the
only
difference
now
is
that
we
open
them
at
the
border
rather
than
giving
smugglers
the
opportunity
to
refuse
delivery
and
escape
detection.
now,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stevens’
questions
about
the
statutory
authority,
i
do
not
know
if
there
really
is
a
serious
question
here.
it
is
hard
to
understand
why
congress
would
intend
to
exempt
envelopes
or
packages,
no
one
disputes
the
packages
can
be
opened,
from
customs
inspections.
certainly
the
postal
services
and
the
custom
service
have
considered
for
the
last
100
years
that
they
have
this
authority.
this
court
considered
in
cotzhausen
in
1882
that
they
had
that
authority,
and
in
none
of
the
court
of
appeals
cases
has
anyone
ever
questioned
the
statutory
authority
to
open
envelopes,
letter
class
envelopes
or
packages.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
government
has
been
opening
packages…
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
mr.
justice
stevens,
packages
have
always
been
opened
at
the
border
without
the
addressee
being
present
under
the…
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
correct,
that
is
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
and
in
fact
i
believe
cotzhausen
might
have
been
considered
a
package
rather
an
envelope
under
the
court
of
appeals
stand.
