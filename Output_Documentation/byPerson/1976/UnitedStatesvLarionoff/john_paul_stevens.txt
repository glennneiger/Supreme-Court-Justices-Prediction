justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
keeffe,
may
i
ask
you
question,
again
with
a
concrete
example,
as
i
understand
that
the
question
is
whether
the
right
attaches
the
date
he
signs
the
extension
agreement
or
at
the
time
period
begin.
now,
at
the
time,
he
signs
the
extension
agreement,
there
are
two
variables
that
may
affect
the
amount
payable
to;
one,
the
amount
of
the
regular
bonus
and
secondly
the
multiple.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
you
say
multiple,
now,
is
the
bonus
itself
fixed
as
of
that
time,
or
is
that
it
could
change?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
true
that
as
of
the
date,
they
sign
the
extension
agreement.
they
could
not
then
have
computed
the
dollars
that
would
have
been
payable
to
them
under
their
theory,
under
your
interpretation
of
regulations
because
they
didn't
know
what
they
would
be
earning
four
years
hence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
there
is
anything
in
the
statute
regulations
that
would
have
prevented
the
military
from
changing
during
the
four
of
period
the
basic
reenlistment
bonus
by
cutting
it
in
half,
say
a
half-a-months
pay
instead
of
a
full
month's
pay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones,
i
have
two
questions,
if
i
might
ask
you.
first,
is
there
anything
in
the
history
of
the
other
case
or
in
the
specifically,
to
properly
know
about
with
respect
to
an
increase
in
the
award
level
which
the
government
did
in
fact
pay,
would
tend
to
confirm
with
these.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
do
you
understand
the
court
of
appeals
to
disagree
with
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
his
regulations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
it
based
at
all
on
the
legislative
history?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones,
i
had
a
second
question
i
want
to
ask
you.
would
you
agree
that
if
your
opponent
is
correct
and
the
if
the
right
vested
at
the
time
the
extension
agreement
is
signed,
it
would
be
more
or
less
an
analogous
to
say
earned
compensation
for
a
month
of
service.
on
that
hypothesis,
the
example
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist
gave
of
changing
the
level
of
pay,
would
really
not
be
appropriate
because
that
would
--
you
wouldn't
say
that
the
government
could
change
the
level
of
pay
for
october,
some
time
in
november.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
you
would
not
rely
on
the
analogy
of
the
military
cutting
the
pay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes
if
that's
appearing
in
the
regulation.
