justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
i
understand
you
earlier
you
indicated
that
the
rescission
issue
had
been
decided
adverse
to
them
at
the
court
of
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
do
not
understand
that,
was
that
the
main
opinion
by
judge
mcgowan?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
page
32(a)
of
the
petition
presort,
the
question
is
whether
the
rescission
falls
within
that
narrow
exception.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
and
then
normally,
a
court's
exercise
in
(inaudible)
jurisdiction
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
equitable
matters
but
there
are
some
exceptions
and
the
court
says,
we
have
serious
doubt
as
to
whether
this
case
falls
into
that
exception
but
the
answer
is
we
find
it
necessary
to
resolve
these
doubts
one
way
or
the
other.
since
on
the
basis,
the
record
reports,
we
find
it
impossible
to
sustain
a
judicial
decree
of
rescission
but
only
because
they
ordered
that
vrb
to
be
paid.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
they
certainly
don't
say
what
their
view
is
if
the
vrb
is
not
to
be
paid.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
but
they
just
said
that
since
their
avoiding
the
vrb's
they
don't
need
to
decide
the
rescission
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
let's
assume
the
reverse,
and
say
they
are
not
going
to
get
the
vrb's,
do
you
mean
the
rescission
of
--
should
in
a
case
go
back
and
have
the
court
of
appeals
decide
them
to
resolve
the
doubts
if
they
found
it
unnecessary
to
resolve.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
if
the
court
of
appeals
has
never
decided
it
the
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
i
think
they
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
get
this.
are
you
really
--
you
must
stand
on
the
contract,
must
you
do
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
that
if
you
are
supporting
the
judgment
of
court
of
appeals,
you
must
because
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
went
on
the
basis
that
this
was
part
of
the
consideration.
justice
byron
r.
white
namely
pay,
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
be
here
if
the
contract
have
said
that
but
excluding
vrb's.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
need
the
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
navy
regs.
what
if
the
contract
said
this
but
the
navy
regulations
were
very
clear
that
the
vrb
--
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
his
part
of
his
pay
would
be
the
vrb's
that
were
then
in
effect.
what
if
it
were
perfectly
clear
that
--
what
if
the
regs
were
perfectly
clear
against
you.
what
would
you
say
the
regulation
be
invalid?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
contract
says
exactly
what
it
does
now,
in
consideration
of
pay
allowances
and
benefits
and
then
there
was
a
regulation
which
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
you
would
not
get
the
vrb.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
wouldn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
then
that
such
a
regulation
would
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
certainly
i
don't
understand
then
how
you
can
go
much
farther
because
the
secretary
interpreting
his
own
regulation
has
said
that
under
the
regulations
you
don't
get
the
vrb.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
that's
the
reasonable
construction
of
statute,
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
then
you
say
that
would
be
all
and
you
say
such
a
regulation
would
not
violate
the
statute.
just
a
moment
ago
you
said
that
in
the
claim
perhaps
you
would
like
to
reconsider
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
still
say
that
if
a
regulation
were
perfectly
clear
that
they
would
not
get
the
vrb,
that
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
i
am
saying
at
the
time
they
agree
to
extend,
at
the
very
time
they
agree
to
extend
here,
it's
perfectly
clear
from
the
regulations
that
they
will
all
get
only
the
vrbs
that
are
in
effect
during
their
period
of
reenlistment
or
of
extension,
that
regulation
is
perfectly
clear
and
they
going
ahead
and
nevertheless
find
it
up
because
they
want
the
special
training.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say,
then
such
a
regulation
would
be
consistent
with
the
statue?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
want
to
make
clear,
if
we
disagreed
with
you
and
held
or
thought
that
the
government
really
did
promise
these
vrbs
contrary
to
your
position,
you
are
not
relying
on
any
power
or
you
would
lose
them,
i
think,
you
are
not
relying
on
any
power
of
congress
to
reduce
whatever
they
promised?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
fact,
i
would
thought
that
in
essence
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
seem
to
have
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
never,
there
is
no
basic
for
rescission.
