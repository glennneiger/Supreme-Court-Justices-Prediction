mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
dealing
with
an
act
to
congress
that
was
passed
during
the
war
and
the
bonuses
before
this
court
would
passed
to
induce
these
plaintiffs
to
extend
their
enlistment,
and
understand
what
happened
here.
you
have
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
section
308(g)
and
you
have
to
listen
as
you
read
to
the
words
of
secretary
mcnamara
when
he
asked
for
these
bonuses.
he
was
faced
with
a
situation
where
first-termers,
that
is
'men
and
women
in
our
service
who
are
under
four
year
contracts
were
enlisting
at
the
rate
of
25%
and
all
other
enlistments
in
our
services
fell
in
the
rate
of
85%".
there
was
an
astounding
attrition
rate,
in
that
first
term,
and
it
was
this
findings
by
the
secretary,
that
drew
him
to
the
conclusion
that
something
outs
was
needed
to
induce
military
personnel
to
extend
their
enlistments.
this
coupled
with
the
fact
that
the
training
required
for
these
men
and
women
is
very
expensive.
the
testimony
in
the
congress
is
that
it
was
over
$10,000
a
person.
therefore,
of
course,
if
you
lost
a
person
in
a
critically
undermanned
skill,
you
have
to
retrain
them
at
a
substantial
cost.
so,
in
addition
to
training
which
was
offered
these,
men
and
women,
they
were
also
offered
bonuses,
substantial
bonuses
to
induce
them
to
extend
their
enlistments.
in
critically
undermanned
skills,
and
it
is
this
background
that
these
plaintiffs
survived
in
our
services.
they
enlisted
for
four
years
in
basic
training,
they
were
told,
not
justice
rehnquist
and
mr.
chief
justice
that
their
pay
wouldn't
be
changed.
they
were
told
that
if
they
extended
their
enlistments,
they
would
receive
bonuses
and
the
bonuses
were
computed
of
their
regular
re-enlistment
bonuses.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
yes
sir,
i
do
and
i
think
it's
a
fundamental
difference
between
--
that
is
to
say
between
petitioner's
respondents.
that
difference
is
there
is
that
we
do
not
say
that
the
congress
could
not
change
basic
pay.
in
your
case,
your
illustration
from
$50
to
$45.
we
could
see
that.
we
also
say,
the
congress
has
the
power
to
provide
specific
bonuses
to
induce
people
to
extend,
something
outs,
basic
pay
one
thing,
these
bonuses
are
something
outs.
the
congress
said
and
you
read
the
testimony
that
moves
the
congress
to
spend
this
kind
of
money
and
it
says,
we
want
to
concentrate
retention
dollars
at
the
decision
making
point.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
that
probably
true.
that's
true.
however,
the
question
is
whether
bonus
is
an
inducement,
a
specific
promise
to
pay
by
the
congress
to
these
persons
to
extend
their
enlistments
for
an
additional
two
years.
that
something
outs
and
we
said
it
is
something
outs.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
i
suppose,
the
difference
is
that
if
you,
there
wouldn't
be
any
difference
there
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
believe
that
you
said
exactly
how
much
you
are
going
to
give
them
and
when
they
were
going
to
get
it.
other
than
that,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
there
much
of
a
difference.
what
we
had
here
over
sir,
was
a
finding
by
the
court
below
based
upon
an
extensive
review
of
the
legislative
history,
that
it
wasn't
the
intent
of
congress
to
do
something
very
specific,
at
a
very
specific
point
in
time.
and
one
that
could
be
calculated,
and
i
may
say
that
when
you
look
at
the
records,
you
are
going
to
find
that
there
will
never
be
an
other
vrb
case
here,
i
don't
believe
because
they
were
only
dealing
with
a
peculiarity
of
the
manner
in
which
this
was
administered
by
the
navy.
when
you
look
at,
for
instance,
taschler
v.
united
states
in
204
in
the
court
acclaims
you
will
see
said
out
there
exactly
what
happened
in
the
other
services.
one
of
the
problems
here,
as
you
know
is
that
are
they
repealed
or
rather
part
of
the
class
lost
their
bonuses
because
the
navy
said
that
their
skill
was
no
longer
critically
undermanned
and
as
a
result
they
no
longer
got
the
bonuses
and
so
they
said,
well,
if
we
do
not
get
the
bonuses
does
that
mean
we
have
to
serve
the
two
years
and
the
answer
was
categorically,
yes.
yes
you
have
to
serve
the
two
years.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
i
appreciate
that
that
was
a
finding,
sir.
the
only
thing,
i
can
say
is
that
when
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
it
would
appear
that
the
men
who
are
entitled
to
their
bonuses
through
act
of
congress
and
i
would
also
say
to
you
sir,
that
the
bonuses
that
they
were
entitled
to,
i
believe,
they
were
entitled
to
under
the
navy
regulations
themselves.
it's
only
when
you
gain
into
this
slippery
interpretation
that
the
secretary
of
the
navy
used
which
was
to
say,
"in
the
first
three
months
of
your
four
year
extension
or
four
year
contract,
you
extend
for
two
years
or
extend
for
two
years
making
it
a
four
year
obligation".
but
we
don't
pay
you
the
bonuses,
until
you
start
the
first
day
of
the
third
year.
we
don't
pay
you
the
bonuses.
so,
these
men
and
women
all
enlist,
or
extend
their
enlistments
induced
by
these
bonuses,
a
whole
two
years
and
then
as
they
approach
the
fifth
year,
the
navy
says,
'these
skills
are
no
longer
critically
undermanned
and
therefore
we
don't
give
any
bonuses'.
and
this
has
a
peculiar
effect,
if
properly
administered
in
a
computerized
world
of
never
having
to
pay
the
bonuses,
because
you
always
can
induced
enough
people
presumably
through
your
recruitments
to
fill
the
necessary
need,
then
declare,
no
longer
critical
and
you
don't
get
your
bonus.
in
a
majority
the
plaintiffs
before
this
court
had
that
happen
to
them.
one
plaintiff,
in
particular
was
denied
his
bonus
for
another
reason.
that
reason
was
a
congress
in
1974,
did
away
with
the
variable
re-enlistment
bonuses
and
when
they
did
that
the
question
was
raised
whether
or
not
the
statute
prohibited
the
navy
from
paying
that
person's
bonus.
that's
what
we
refer
to
as
the
johnson
class
or
the
johnson
i.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
these
plaintiffs
would
have
left.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
no
sir,
i
have
not
believe
so,
because
congress.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
they
have
a
claim
now
because
congress
said
you
have
--
we
want
you
to
serve.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
yes
sir.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
i
don't
believe
we
would
your
honor
because,
i
believe
the
legislative
history
here
demonstrates
that
congress
intended
to
pay
these
bonuses
for
people
to
serve
in
a
critically
undermanned
skill.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
yes
sir,
it
did
but
not,
there
is
no
evidence
that
it
changed
it
as
to
vrb
for
these
persons
who
had
previously
enlisted,
extended
their
enlistments.
they
are
different
class
of
persons.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
on
the
first
day?
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
because,
i
believe
it's
clear,
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
it's
because
of
the
recruitment
provisions
by
the
way
that
were
mentioned
by
the
petitioners.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
i
believe
there
would
for
only
that
which
would
be
to
due
in
owing
them.
that
is
to
say.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
i
don't
think
he
would
have
gone
in
?.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
it
if
i
don't
think,--
i
think
that
the
intent
of
the
congress,
justice
marshall
was
to
have
these
persons
extend
their
enlistments,
fill
a
need
and
serve
and
the
congress
is
quite
critical
about
the
services
that
put
a
lot
of
people
to
extend
and
then
let
them
do
something
outs.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
nothing.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
yes,
there
is,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
in
his
contract.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
the
contract
says
that,
in
consideration
of
paid
benefit
and
allowances
to
be
received.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
no
sir,
it
doesn't.
the
government
stipulates
however,
as
they
did
in
the
court
below
that
pay
includes
a
variable
reenlistment
bonus.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
well,
that
is
incorrect
in
--
we
have..
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
yes,
i
suppose
he
has.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
yes,
it
has
and
i
think
it
in
it's
point
itself
up
in
the
carini
case
in
the
fourth
circuit
where
judge
haynesworth
says
in
their
early
parted
opinion,
judge
haynesworth
says
that
,'i
find
that
that
statement
paid
benefit
and
allowances
doesn't
include
vrb',
which
i
believe
is
the
point
that
you
are
making
justice
marshall,
and
the
act...
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
yes,
that
the
government
conceded
that.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
yes,
i
do.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
yes,
i
believe,
it
can.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
it
would
appear
that
way
perhaps
on
the
surface
and
i
appreciate
your
curling
it
to
my
attention
but
i
think
that
the
answer
is
that
this
is
a
special
kind
of
incentive
pay,
inducement
pay.
it's
a
different
kind
of
pay
than
what
we
refer
to
is
is
generally,
pay.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
on
the
contract,
yes.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
yes
but.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
yes
sir.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
excluding
vrb,
no
i
don't
think,
i
would.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
i
need,
i
need
that
agreement
between
the
serviceman
and...
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
when
you
say
perfectly
clear
against
me,
you
mean
it
would
not
give
us
the
vrb.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
and
also
the
contract
would
exclude.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
further
language.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
if
the
regulation
said
that
we
wouldn't
be
here.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
no
sir.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
yes
it
would,
because
it
left
--
because
statute
308(g)
left
to
the
secretary
of
defense
who
in
turn
allowed
the
service
secretaries
to
regulate.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
you
have
to.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
obviously,
we
say,
it
is
not.
first
of
all,
obviously
we
say,
it
did
not
and
we
so,
--
it
was
so
found
in
the
court
below.
they
had
looked
at
that
understanding.
you
have,
first
of
all,
you
have
their
contract
and
the
contract
says
pay
benefits
and
allowances
and
the
government
says,
in
the
dc
circuit
not
in
the
fourth
circuit,
but
in
the
dc
circuit
it
says,
that
includes
the
vrb
and
then
we
look
to
the
question
of
the
regulations
as
to
the
eligibility
of
these
people
under
the
regulations
and
we
find
that
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
regulations
is
that
they
are
entitled
under
the
navy
regulation
to
the
bonuses.
now,
if
and
that's
our
position
now,
if
you
say
that
the
regulations
do
not
best
arrive
or
do
not
confer,
an
entitlement
on
these
plaintiffs,
then
you
have
got
to
match
the
regulations
against
the
intent
of
congress.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
i
only
reconsider
it
to
the
extent
that
i
would
presume
when
you
say
in
your
hypothetical
on
the
regulations
that
these
persons
would
not
have
extended
in
the
critically
undermanned
skill
and
had
been
promised
there
variable
re-enlistment
bonuses.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
i
presume,
you
are
saying
that
the
time
may
extend
mr.
justice
white.
you
obviously?
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
then
they
wouldn't
be
entitled
it
seems
to
me
to
the?
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
i
believe
it
would
because
here
you
would
have
a
situation
where
they
wouldn't
be
paying
any
of
the
bonuses
to
these
men,
they
wouldn't
be
asking
them
to
extend
and
i
presume
they
wouldn't
be
told
that
they
were
entitled
to
those
bonuses.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
a
different
--
having
posed
that
problem,
you
have
a
different
case
here,
because
we
find
two
things,
we
find
that
they
are
eligible
under
the
statute
for
the
bonuses
and
we
also
find
that
that
under
the
regulation
as
found
by
the
court
below,
that
they
were
entitled
to
the
bonuses.
so,
in
this
instance
i
think
you
do
have
a
different
case.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
yes.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
the
multiple
is
not
varied
justice
stevens.
you
have
--
the
only
thing
that
you
can't
compute
to
a
dollar
and
the
cents
figure
is
the
exact
amount
of
the
bonus
in
dollars
and
cents
because
the
bonus
is
a
variable
of
your
regular
reenlistment
bonus
and
your
reenlistment
bonus
works
of
how
much
you
are
being
paid.
for
example,
these
were
petty
officers,
they
might
have
a
different
rate.
there
was
nothing
unclear
in
this
case
about
what
the
multiple
was
going
to
be,
they
were
promised
a
multiple
of
four,
the
highest
possible
multiple
available
to
them.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
no,
but
they
didn't
know
that
whatever
their
reenlistment
bonus
was,
it
was
going
to
be
a
multiple
four
of
that,
they
knew
that,
they
knew
it
was
going
to
be
four,
because
the
way
the
services
operated
was
they
said,
this
is
the
most
critically
undermanned
skill.
you
are
looking
at
the
plaintiffs
here
who
are
persons
such
as
the
men
who
were
in
the
(inaudible)
in
a
different
period
of
time,
highly
technically
trained
people,
very
competent
people,
very
expensively
trained.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
no,
i
do
not,
i
don't
think
so,
although
i
have
to
say
that
if
you
read
the
legislative
history
of
308(g),
there
was
very
definite
effort
to
fix
a
certain
amount
of
money
at
a
decision
point
and
that
obviously
would
reduce
it
of
course,
because
your
multiple
would
be
going
up
half
of
what
it
was.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
it
would
appear
that
we
would
go
that
far,
it
would
appear
that
you
could
do
that
because
obviously
the
re-enlistment
bonus,
the
regular
reenlistment
bonus
was
multiple
of
your
regular
pay
and
the
logic
of
it
would
appear
to
go
that
far.
the
only
thing
i
can
say
in
answer
to
that
is
that,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
had
in
mind,
as
we
view
it
and
as
i
stated
here
this
morning,
an
intend
to
give
a
specific
amount
of
money
to
induce
people
to
extend.
now,
that
certainly
would
frustrate
that
and
we
then
would
back
in
a
position
of
having
to
design
when
the
extensions
went
in
to
effect
and
if
you
follow
the
opinion
below
and
as
we
suggest,
the
time
that
you
decide
what
these
men
are
going
to
get
in
the
multiple
there
of,
is
at
the
time
they
extend,
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
you
would
have
to
compute
the
bonuses
at
that
time
of
what
their
basic
pay
was
then,
in
order
to
effectuate
a
congressional
purpose.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
yes
of
course,
none
of
these
plaintiffs.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
yes
there
was
a
practice
of
paying
a
multiple
of
four,
yes?
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
although,
we
don't
know
how
many
of
them
for
sure
because
as
i
say
the
way
the
logic
of
the
matter
is
in
now
stands,
with
sophisticated
computers,
you
might
have
been
able
not
pay
anybody,
anything.
you
see,
if
you
fill
a
critical
manned
skill
and
then
go
on.
now,
i
may
dwell
on
two
other
points.
there
are
two
opposing
cases
here,
one
in
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
other
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
as
i
started
to
say,
on
the
fourth
circuit
case
in
carini,
judge
haynesworth
says,
in
way
that
i
don't
understand,
he
said
that,
'the
paid
benefit
and
allowances
didn't
include
the
variable
re-enlistment
bonus',
and
he
couldn't
see
it
there
and
therefore
that
was
evidence
of
the
fact
they
wont
promise
the
variable
re-enlistment
bonus,
and
in
the
dc
circuit,
the
government
had
certified
in
the
brief
conceded
that
pay
included
the
variable
re-enlistment
bonus.
so,
either
that
was
in
air,
or
outs
they
changed
the
position
there,
i
don't
know
which.
in
the
other
case
that
is
the
other
circuit
case,
is
judge
snead's(ph)
opinion
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
that
has
to
do
with
only
one
group
of
the
plaintiffs.
it
has
to
do
with
mr.
johnson
who
is
alleged
was
denied
his
bonus
because
of
a
change
in
the
statute
that
is
to
say
that
vrb
was
eliminated
and
there
judge
snead(ph)
says
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
statute
itself
that
would
indicate
that
there
was
any
basis
for
preserving
vrb
for
mr.
johnson.
so,
in
addition
to
losing
his
bonus
under
the
regulations,
the
change
in
the
regulations,
it
also
has
alleged,
he
loses
it
under
a
repeal
of
the
308(g)
where
they
put
in
a
new
bonus
provision.
now,
we
have
looked
at
legislative
history
in
here,
again,
we
say,
we
don't
see
any
support
for
that.
judge
snead
states
it
but
if
we
review
it,
as
we
have,
i
don't
see
any
support
for
that
position.
secondly
if,
that
is
so,
we
still
look
to
an
operation
of
the
bonus.
we
give
you
an
example
in
the
brief
itself
where
we
say,
we
think
they
would
be
eligible.
johnson
would
be
eligible
under
the
current
statute
because
although
vrb
was
eliminated.
we
don't
see
any
basis
for
denying
it
to
johnson
and
we
think
that
the
way
the
statute
operates,
the
multiple
affects
johnson
in
a
way
where
he
can
get
his
bonuses.
in
particular,
we
stated
an
illustration
there
to
cover
that.
in
addition
to
that,
we
also
said
that
if
there
was
an
intent,
then
we
outthrust
into
the
question
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
saw
in
united
states
v.
lynch
where
it
appears
clearly
the
reason
for
repealing
the
variable
re-enlistment
investment
bonuses
which
were
only
in
effect
from
65
to
74
right
in
the
period
of
the
war,
that
if
that
was
the
case,
congress
was
exercising
its
fiscal
responsibility
and
in
that
to
that
extend,
they
are
impairing
the
men's
contract.
but
i
don't
think
we
have
to
get
to
that
position.
i
think
johnson
is
qualified
because
of
his
extension
agreement
and
the
agreement
of
the
congress
to
pay
him
at
the
time,
he
made
that
decision.
if
not,
i
think
that
he
is
still
as
eligible
under
the
statute,
as
it's
amended,
and
lastly
if
that
isn't
the
case,
then
it
appears
we
have
or
look
to
the
question
of
the
conflict
of
the
statute
and
lynch
v.
united
states.
in
the
few
moments
i
had,
have
left,
i'd
like
to
dwell
on,
i
haven't
touched
really
on
the
equity
fee
or
i
also
haven't
which
i
am
sure
the
court
appreciate
is,
all
the
courts
below
have
are
very
much
on
our
side.
our
people
are
people
were
induced
to
extend
and
did
serve
and
they
deserve
a
just
consideration.
i
also
think
it
was
intended
that
they
should
do
so,
and
the
congress
intended
to
pay
them.
it
is
a
large
group,
but
i
do
think
that
the
equities
are
very
much
on
their
side.
i
would
also
say
that
i
think
that
we
concede,
we
do
concede
that
basic
pay
could
be
change,
we
think
that
the
legislative
history
308(g)
indicates
that
congress
intended
a
specific
amount
of
money
be
paid
to
these
men
and
for
that
men
and
women
and
for
that
they
serve.
are
there
any
another
questions?
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
increased?
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
yes
that's
right
and
of
course,
that
would
frustrate
the
intent
of
congress,
the
way
they
operated
because
of
course,
congress
didn't
want
him
to
spread
the
bonus
all
over,
they
wanted
them
to
fix
what
was
necessary
to
fill
a
critical
need
and
that
is
the
logic
that
the
government
proceeds
at.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
we
don't
in
this
case
your
honor
because
we
moved
quickly
through
summary
judgment
so,
i
can't
say
that
it
is
here
but
it
may
be
in
the
related
cases,
in
particularly
saylors
v.
united
states
which
is
a
consolidate
case
in
the
ninth
circuit.
i
presume,
there
were
--
i
am
only
guessing,
i
would
only
be
guessing.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
well,
in
your
example,
they
say
they
are
going
to
pay
them
twice
the
basic
pay,
then
they
take
them
in.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
no
i
don't
agree
that
that
would
be
proper?
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
i
believe
that
is
correct,
try
the
facts
here.
presuming
your
hypothetical,
what
happens
is
that
i
am
doing
one
job
and
i
am
fully
qualified
to
do
it
and
you
say
to
me,
i
will
pay
you
twice
your
basic
pay
to
do
this
other
job,
the
next
day,
and
you
immediately
proceed
in.
i
believe
that
there
the
government
would
be
required
to
pay
you
the
double
pay.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
presumably
on
the
basis
of
the
congressional
intent
to
allow
to
offer.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
then
we
have
the
problem
of
united
states
v.
lynch,
because
if
they
do
it
exercising
the
war
power
or
paramount
power,
obviously
they
have
the
authority
to
do
it.
but
if
they
doing
it
simply
for
the
purposes
of
fiscal
administration,
we
have
a
separate
problem
and
there?
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
yes.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
no
sir
i
don't
see
that.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
i
presume
that
the
court
would
have
sustain
that
kind
of
reduction.
i
don't
see,
i
would
i
think
you
would
have
to
fashion
a
maiden
way
to
do
it.
but
that.
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
i
would
hope
that
they
would
have
to
have
a
good
reason
for
it
mr.
chief
justice
but
they
don't
think?
mr.
stephen
daniel
keeffe
yes,
i
do
know,
thank
you
justice
blackmun,
i
knew
that
was
the
case.
what
i
had
in
concluding
that
question
when
i
thought
was
that,
in
looking
at
what
congress
promised
here
and
then
what
they
did
it,
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
are
looking
at
a
situation,
where
if
there
is
a
merely
to
reduce
expenditures
here
was
the
to
eliminate
these
promises
to
these
men
and
women
than
you
outthrust
into
that
question
but
only
as
to
part
of
process
before
the
court,
a
largest
number,
were
not
denied
the
bonuses
by
act
of
congress,
they
were
denied
it
by
a
change
in
the
regulations.
