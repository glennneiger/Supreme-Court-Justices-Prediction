justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
keeffe,
suppose
on
the
first
day
of
the
year,
they
say,
we
don't
need
your
service,
it
is
all,
good
bye?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
would
they
have
any
claim.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
do
they
have
a
claim
now.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
said,
the
congress
says
you
should
get
a
bonus.
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
the
first
day
of
the
fifth
year,
now,
in
my
hypothetical,
on
first
the
first
day
of
the
fifth
year,
they
said,
the
two
things
we
don't
do,
one
is
give
you
a
bonus
and
let
you
stay,
you
admit,
you
wouldn't
have
any
case
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
congress
change
its
mind,
did
not
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
wouldn't
they
be
entitled
to
the
bonus?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
the
serviceman
died
on
the
first
day,
would
he
have
his
right
of
action
for
the
bonus
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
then
you
don't
agree
that
when
--
if
they
let
it
go,
the
first
day
you
say
he
would
be
entitled
to
bonus.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
died
the
first
day,
his
heirs
would.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
shows
that
the
government
made
any
contract,
deal
or
anything
with
him
to
pay
him
a
bonus.
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
he
signed
for
his
extended
period,
there
is
nothing
in
that
that
said
you
get
a
bonus.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
does
it
say.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
that's
i
don't.
do
they
say
bonus'
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
thought
i
understood
mr.
jones,
to
say
there
was
nothing
in
that,
promise
of
the
bonus.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah
i
mean,
you
said,
he
agreed
to
it.
did
he
agree
to
it
then,
as
he
change
his
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
government
changes.
