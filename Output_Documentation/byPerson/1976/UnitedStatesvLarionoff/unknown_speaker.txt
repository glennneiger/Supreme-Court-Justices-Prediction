unknown
speaker
has
this
been
your
position
throughout?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
you
just
said.
unknown
speaker
and
--
is
your
--
unknown
speaker
would
you
repeat
what
you
just
said?
unknown
speaker
an
extension
of
enlistment
would
be
typically
what
from.
unknown
speaker
mr.
jones,
if
a
man
who
dies
somewhere
along
the
line,
does
that
make
any
difference
at
all?
unknown
speaker
there's
not
ever
been
the
effect
to
your
knowledge,
if
a
man
dies...
unknown
speaker
i
suppose,
there
is
no
doubt
is
there
--
mr.
jones
that
if
i
enlist
in
the
army
as
the
private
and
the
pay
is
in
fact
was
less
than
$50
a
month
and
i
enlist
for
three
years
and
two
months
later,
congress
reduces
the
pay
to
$45,
i
have
to
stay
in
the
army,
three
years?
unknown
speaker
these
were
alleged
and
oral
all
promise
by
recruiting
officers.
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
they
had
expressly
reserved
the
question.
well
than
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
a
permissible
interpretation.
unknown
speaker
it
maybe.
unknown
speaker
not,
so
the
issue
is
in
here
or
will
never
will
be
anywhere
but
not
because
they
failed
to
file
across?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
difference
between
those
two,
you
obviously
think
there
is..
unknown
speaker
but
hey,
pay
too
is
an
inducement
to
enlist.
i
mean,
the
pay
that
a
person
gets
in
the
armed
services
at
whatever
level,
if
there
were
no
pay,
you
probably
wouldn't
enlist.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
answer,
the
court
gave
in
orloff
v.
willoughby
too,
wasn't
it,
that
the
plaintiff
there
said,
he
is
entitled
to
a
commission
because
he
was
a
doctor
and
he
had
been
drafted
as
a
doctor
and
the
government
refused
to
commission
and
then
he
said,
at
least
let
me
out
and
this
court
said,
we
will
not
let
you
out
and
you
will
not
get
a
commission.
unknown
speaker
in
your
brief,
as
i
understand
you
have
in
the
stipulation
that
that
the
vrb
is
pays,
is
that?
unknown
speaker
and
you
asserted.
unknown
speaker
did
i
understand
you
to
say
before
agreeing
again
which
justice
rehnquist
that
the
department
can
reduce
your
pay
during
your
term
of
enlistment.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
this
is
pay,
haven't
you
stipulated
yourself
in
to
a
precarious
position
to
put
it?
unknown
speaker
the
problem,
i
see
is
you
are
claiming
a
fixed
rate,
that
there
is
bonus
would
be
the
four
times
x,
and
you
are
saying
it's
fixed
rate
to
four
but
the
government
can
change
the
x
and
as
soon
as
he
admit
that,
it
seems
to
me
he
may
be
admitting
they
can
make
x
zero.
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
tell
us,
what
--
during
the
period
they
were
actually
paid,
i
take
that
they
were
four
times,
whatever
the
was
at
the
time,
they
entered
in
to
the
fifth
year.
unknown
speaker
i
know
not
these
plaintiffs,
but
there
was
a
practice
of
paying
and
buying.
unknown
speaker
yes,
four
times
the
salary
of
the
time
of
the?.
unknown
speaker
mr.
keeffe,
i
had
one
another,
is
there
anything
in
the
history
of
this
statute
to
indicate
that
the
multiples
were
increased?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
say
a
man
signed
an
extension
being
on
the
level
of
two
and
a
couple
of
years
later
went
to
four
understand,
understand
of
the
government's
version
where
he
would
be
entitled
to
four
at
the
time
of
the
extension
even
though
when
he
signed
up
he
is
only
offered
two.
unknown
speaker
my
question
is,
do
you
know
if
that
ever
happened,
that
we
have
any
history
of
the
whether
the
government
is
enacted...
unknown
speaker
mr.
keeffe,
getting
back
to
brother
rehnquist's
point,
assuming
congress
authorized
and
the
navy
specifically
said
that
in
this
electronic
outset,
we
are
building
up,
we
need
trained
men
etcetera
in
order
to
get
them
and
keep
them,
we
will
pay
them
twice
the
basic
salary,
and
if
they
come
it,
and
as
soon
as
they
get
in,
they
cut
it
back.
i
understand,
to
me
that's
alright.
unknown
speaker
the
next
day
they
got
it
back.
unknown
speaker
what
should
difference
between
--
the
answer
you
said,
they
cut
his
basic
pay,
he
could
not
do
anything
about
it.
i
thought
that's
what
you
said.
unknown
speaker
on
what
basis?
unknown
speaker
congress
is
the
one
who
changed
it.
congress
authorized
double
pay
and
then
they
changed.
unknown
speaker
forty
and
odd
years
ago
during
the
depression
when
the
pay
of
everyone
in
the
government
except
those
protected
by
the
constitution
was
reduced
10-20%.
unknown
speaker
there
was
any
barriers
to
that?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
in
active
congress
simply
said
we're
going
broke,
we
have
got
a
depression
on,
20%
reduction.
