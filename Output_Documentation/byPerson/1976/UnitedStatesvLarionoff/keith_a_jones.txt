is

mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
which
arises
under
a
statute,
that
has
since
been
appealed.
it's
whether
the
variable
re-enlistment
bonus
of
an
enlisted
man
who
extends
his
enlistment
in
military
service.
it
is
computed
as
of
the
date,
he
signs
his
extension
agreement
or
instead
as
of
the
later
day
which
he
enters
in
to
the
service
of
the
extension
period.
this
issue
involves
approximately
$60
or
$70
million
military
pay.
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
conflict
among
the
circuits.
in
order
to
understand
it's
case,
it
is
necessary
first
to
understand
the
considerations
that
led
to
enactment
of
statutory
authority
for
payment
of
variable
re-enlistment
bonus.
also
to
understand
the
manner
in
which
the
department
of
defense
exercise
that
authority.
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1965,
during
the
first
major
phase
of
this
country's
military
undertaking
in
vietnam.
at
that
time,
the
department
of
defense
was
concerned.
that
enlisted
men
possessing
critical
military
skills
would
re-enter
civilian
life
at
the
end
of
their
original
enlistment
periods.
leaving
the
department
of
defense
was
the
essential
but
expensive
task
of
training
new
men
in
those
skills.
it
was
determined
that
the
offer
of
a
large
bonus
in
addition
to
the
existing
so
called
regular
re-enlistment
bonus
not
induce
substantial
members
if
enlisted
men
to
re-enlist
at
the
end
of
their
original
enlistment
periods.
it
was
further
determined
that
the
size
of
the
bonus
in
each
case
should
depend
upon
the
importance
of
the
particular
military
skill
to
the
military.
accordingly
congress
authorized
the
secretary
of
defense
to
assign
to
each
military
skill
and
award
level
ranging
from
0-4
depending
upon
the
importance
of
that
skill
to
the
military
at
that
time.
these
award
levels
were
subject
to
annual
review
and
modification
as
the
military's
needs
changed.
the
bonus
called
the
variable
re-enlistment
bonus
was
equal
to
regular
re-enlistment
bonus
multiplied
by
the
award
level
in
effect
for
the
enlisted
man
skill
at
that
skill
level
at
the
time
of
his
re-enlistment.
the
present
purposes,
the
most
significant
aspects
of
this
history
or
that
variable
re-enlistment
bonus
statute
by
its
terms,
refers
only
to
re-enlistment
not
to
extensions
of
enlistment
and
that
there
is
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history,
that
either
the
department
of
defense
or
congress
gave
consideration
to
have
or
even
whether
the
variable
re-enlistment
bonus
program
would
apply
to
extensions
of
enlistment.
now,
this
is
important
because
extensions
differ
from
re-enlistments
in
two
fundamental
aspects.
it
differs
to
timing
and
extension
typically
is
entered
in
to
right
at
the
outset
of
the
man's
military
service
or
is
by
contrast,
a
re-enlistment
only
takes
place
at
the
end
of
that
original
enlistment
period.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
has
fund
in
our
position
throughout
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
keith
a.
jones
oh
yes,
there
is
clear
difference
between
extensions
and
re-enlistments.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
oh,
i
am
not
arguing
that
the
statute,
that
the
bonus
program
does
not
apply
to
extensions.
i
am
just
explaining
if
you
would
give
me
time,
how
it
applies.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
said
extensions
differ
from
re-enlistments
in
two
ways.
i
just
described
one
way
which
they
differ,
that
is
as
to
timing.
the
extension
is
entered
into
its
beginning
of
the
period
of
service.
the
re-enlistment
is
entered
into
only
at
the
end
of
the
original
enlistment
period.
the
second
difference
is
more
important
for
this
case.
that
is
the
difference
in
motivation.
an
enlisted
man
extends
his
enlistment
at
the
outset
of
his
military
service,
in
order
to
qualify
for
specialized
training
that
will
lead
to
higher
pay
in
the
military
and
in
some
cases
at
least
to
a
better
career
in
civilian
life
after
he
leaves
the
military.
as
a
condition
of
eligibility
for
specialized
training
of
this
kind,
the
military
requires
often
requires
a
longer
minimum
service
commitment
than
the
original
enlistment
period
and
the
enlisted
man
extends
his
enlistment
at
beginning,
in
order
to
satisfy
that
condition
of
eligibility
and
receive
a
specialized
training.
in
contrast,
a
re-enlistment
is
entered
into
only
at
the
end
of
the
original
enlistment
period.
there
is
no
built-in
incentive
other
than
the
pay,
allowances
and
other
enjoyments
that
military
life
generally
men
afford.
now,
on
view
of
these
differences,
we
cannot
know
how
congress
would
have
legislated
with
respect
to
extensions
of
enlistment.
if
it
had
that
matter,
if
it
explicitly
considered
that
matter.
congress
might
have
concluded
that
the
incentive
of
specialized
training
was
sufficient
alone
to
induce
extensions
and
that
no
additional
bonus
need
be
provided.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
from
four
years
to
six
years.
that's
the
extension
in
this
case.
it
could
be
for
a
lesser
or
greater
period
of
time.
the
original
enlistment
period
here
was
four
years.
i
endure
the
differences
in
timing,
that
is
if
the
extension
is
entered,
if
the
extension
agreement
is
signed
at
the
beginning.
congress
had
it
considered
the
matter,
might
have
acted
to
clarify
the
question,
when
variable
reenlistment
bonus
accrues
in
cases
of
extensions.
but
it
did
neither.
the
statute
and
a
legislative
history
were
silent
as
to
the
intended
application
of
a
variable
reenlistment
bonus
program
to
extensions
of
enlistment.
now,
this
is
not
to
say
that
the
program
does
not
apply
to
extensions
of
enlistment,
but
it
applies
not
by
virtue
of
the
language
of
the
bonus
statute
itself
former
37
u.s.c.
308(g),
but
rather
as
the
consequence
of
the
general
catchall
provision
in
37
u.s.c.
906,
which
provides
that
a
man
who
extends
his
enlistment
is
entitled
to
the
same
pay
and
allowances
as
are
made
available
to
a
man
who
reenlists.
this
means
that
when
congress
passed
the
bonus
statute,
the
secretary
of
defense
was
left
with
the
delegated
responsibility
of
accommodating
the
bonus
program
to
a
group,
service
members
who
extend
their
enlistments,
that
had
not
been
within
the
explicit
contemplation
of
congress
when
it
enacted
the
statute.
now,
the
major
question
confronting
the
secretary
in
this
regard
was
whether
in
cases
of
extensions
the
bonus
was
to
be
measured
on
the
basis
of
the
award
level
that
was
in
effect
when
the
extension
agreement
was
signed
or
instead
on
the
basis
of
the
award
level
that
was
in
effect
on
the
later
date,
when
the
extended
period
was
entered
into.
now,
the
former
alternative
would
have
conceitedly
had
the
advantage
of
relative
certainty.
that
is
at
the
time
the
agreement
was
signed,
every
one
would
know
what
award
level
would
apply.
on
the
other
hand,
relative
certainty
is
to
the
award
level
that
will
apply
to
a
bonus
that
will
not
be
received
for
several
years,
might
not
be
of
major
significance
as
compared
with
the
basic
incentive
or
specialized
training.
but
in
any
event
several
other
considerations
militated
against
measuring
a
bonus
as
of
the
earlier
date.
that
form
of
computation
would
have
led
to
a
potential
disparity
between
the
treatment
of
reenlistments
and
extensions,
would
have
created
the
possibility,
that
a
man
who
entered
into
his
extension
period
would
receive
a
different
bonus,
perhaps
greater,
perhaps
smaller
depending
upon
what
it
happened
to
the
award
level
in
intervening
time,
from
that
received
by
a
man
who
entered
into
his
reenlistment
period
on
the
same
day
possessing
the
same
skill.
now,
this
disparity
in
treatment
could
be
have
been
expected
to
have
led
to
disputes
and
dissatisfaction
and
more
than
that
it
would
appear
to
be
contrary
to
the
statutory
command
of
equal
treatment
for
extensions
and
re-enlistments.
further
more
37
u.s.c.
308(d)
provides
that
a
man
who
reenlists
during
basic
training
is
not
entitled
to
the
bonus.
that
statute
would
seem
to
suggest
in
view
of
the
requirement
of
equal
treatment,
that
the
bonus
could
not
immediately
vest
in
the
case
of
an
extension,
that
was
entered
into,
the
extension
agreement
that
was
signed
during
the
period
of
basic
training.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
if
he
dies
before
he
enters
into
his
extension
period,
our
position
is
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
any
bonus
and
the
matter
hasn't
been
fleshed
out
in
litigation
but
i
assume
that
would
be
the
respondent's
position
too.
there
is
a
provision
in
the
regulations
for
recruitment,
if
the
extension
period
is
not
fully
served.
that
is
if
for
some
reason,
the
man
leaves
the
service
having
finished
only
one
of
the
two
years
of
his
extension
period,
the
navy
could
recruit
one-half
of
his
variable
re-enlistment
bonus.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
the
record
does
not
so
show
because
the
case
is
up
on
summary
judgment
but
it's
my
understanding
that
it
is
common
to
have
recruitment
in
situations
like
that.
well,
let
me
state
further
that
the
bonus
is
paid
in
installments
so
that
the
future
installment
simply
wouldn't
be
paid.
i
think
that,
that
more
than
an
official
recruitment
would
be
the
method
by
which
the
full
bonus
will
not
be
paid.
but
moreover
permitting
the
bonus
divest
at
the
time,
the
extension
agreement
was
signed
but
also
be
the
inconsistent
with
the
secretary's
representation
to
congress
at
the
time
the
bill
is
being
considered
that
there
would
be
no
expressed
or
implied
obligations
with
respect
to
the
future
payments
of
the
bonuses.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
absolutely,
and
the
enlistment
agreements
provide,
and
i
will
get
to
this
little
bit
further,
but
they
are
normally
provide
that
they
are
entered
into
in
consideration
of
the
pay
the
bill
accrued,
whatever
accrues
is
what
the
man
gets
under
the
contract.
with
consideration
of
the
contrary
that
i
just
resided
presumably
in
mind,
the
secretary
promulgated
regulations
that
in
his
view
provide
for
computation
of
the
variable
re-enlistment
bonus.
on
the
basis
of
the
award
level
and
affect
on
the
day
the
man
enters
into
the
extended
period
of
service,
whether
he
enters
into
that
service
by
way
of
reenlistment
or
extension.
now,
there
can
be
no
question
under
the
statute
that
the
secretary
had
latitude
to
adopt
this
rule.
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
regulations
have
the
effect
that
the
secretary
intended.
now,
with
this
rather
extensive
background
in
mind,
i
will
discuss
the
particular
facts
of
this
case.
the
respondents
are
navy
enlisted
men
who
at
the
outset
of
their
service,
extended
their
enlistments
from
four
years
to
six
years,
in
order
to
qualify
for
training
in
the
navy's
program,
what
was
called
advanced
electronics
field.
their
extensions
agreements
stated
that
they
were
entered
into
and
'in
consideration
of
pay,
allowances
and
benefits
which
will
accrue
to
me
during
the
continuances
of
my
service.'
the
agreements
didn't
state
that
the
respondents
would
be
entitled
at
any
point
to
a
variable
re-enlistment
bonus.
indeed
the
agreements
didn't
mention
the
variable
re-enlistment
bonus
at
all.
now,
presume
it
to
these
extension
agreements,
each
respondent
in
fact
did
receive
the
advanced
electronic
field
training
and
that
training
led
to
qualification
in
the
naval
skill
rating
called
communications
technician
maintenance
or
ctm.
now,
the
problem
in
this
case
arises
because
at
the
time
the
respondents
sign
their
extension
agreements.
the
ctm
award
level
was
set
at
four,
the
highest
permissible,
but
by
four
years
later
when
they
entered
into
their
extension
period,
the
ctm
award
level
had
been
reduced
to
zero.
more
over
by
the
time
respondent
johnson
entered
into
service
of
his
extension
period,
congress
had
already
repealed
the
statutory
authority
for
payment
of
variable
re-enlistment
bonuses.
accordingly,
the
navy
refused
to
pay
the
respondents,
the
bonus.
respondents
then
brought
this
suit
claiming
that
their
right
to
bonus
had
accrued
within
the
naming
of
their
extension
agreements
at
the
time
they
signed
those
agreements
and
they
requested
payment
of
the
bonus
based
upon
an
award
level
of
four
or
any
alternative
release
from
service.
some
of
the
respondents
submitted
after
davidson
in
which
they
stated
that
they
had
been
promised
payment
of
the
variable
re-enlistment
bonus
by
a
recruiting
officer
based
upon
the
award
level
four.
in
response,
the
head
of
the
navy's
variable
re-enlistment
bonus
program
submitted
in
after
david,
in
which
he
stated
and
i
quote
''it
is
not
the
policy
of
the
department
of
the
navy
to
promise
specific
eligibility
for
variable
re-enlistment
bonus
nor
is
any
official
authorized
to
make
such
a
promise
and
counseling
with
the
prospective
enlistee'.
government
also
submitted
to
the
court
regulations
requiring
reenlistment
interviewers
to
inform
enlistee's,
and
i
quote
"we
are
the
program
flexibility
and
possibility
of
changes
which
might
decrease
the
amount
of
bonus
to
which
entitled
at
the
time
of
reenlistment'.
both
sides
then
move
for
summary
judgment.
the
district
court
granted
the
respondent's
request
for
payment
of
the
bonuses
and
denied
their
request
for
release
from
service.
both
sides
appealed
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
one
point
should
be
clarified
in
connection
with
these
facts.
respondents
in
this
court
state
as
a
fact
that
they
were
promise
bonuses
based
upon
an
award
level
of
four
but
that
allegation
was
disputed
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
made
no
findings
with
respect
to
that.
more
over
by
granting
summary
judgment
for
the
respondents,
the
district
court
necessarily
proceeded
upon
the
assumption
that
no
such
promise
had
been
made.
in
any
of
them,
we
take
the
position
here
that
whether
or
not
such
a
promise
was
made
is
legally
immaterial
and
so,
far
as
respondents
argue
a
theory
of
promissory
of
stopple
and
did
not
appear
to
do
so,
in
this
court,
it
is
well
established
that
the
government
is
not
to
stop
by
the
unauthorized
representations
of
its
agents
and
respondent
have?
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct,
that
was
the
allegation,
it
is
never
found
as
a
fact.
respondents
have
abandoned
their
request
for
release
from
service
which
presumably
was
based
upon
some
theory
of
misrepresentation
or
mutual
mistake
by
failing
to
file
a
cross
petition
from
that
portion
of
the
judgment
below,
that
was
adverse
to
them.
accordingly
respondents
claim
for
entitlement
to
the
bonus,
turns
upon
the
text
of
the
applicable
military
regulations.
now,
department
of
defense
instruction,
1304.15,
paragraph
vi
a,
which
we
discussed
in
our
brief,
provides
that
'the
members
will
receive
the
award
level
effective
on
the
date
of
their
extension
of
enlistments'.
the
term
extension
of
enlistment
is
not
defined
in
the
regulation.
we
are
showing
some
details
however
on
pages
28
to
30
of
our
brief,
that
both
the
navy
regulations
and
the
extension
agreements
themselves
provide
that
an
extension
does
not
become
effective
until
the
day
following
the
expiration
of
the
original
enlistment
period
and
as
a
corollary
and
this
is
the
military's
constructions
of
its
own
regulations.
the
extension
of
the
enlistment
occurs
only
when
service
of
the
extension
period
begins.
now,
this
is
a
fair
reading
of
the
regulation
and
we
submit
that
it
should
be
sustained,
but
moreover
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
on
page
2,
'if
extension
of
enlistment
were
read
as
the
respondents
suggest,
as
referring
to
the
signing
of
the
extension
agreement
then
respondents
would
never
have
become
even
potentially
eligible
to
receive
a
variable
re-enlistment
bonus".
paragraph
v.b.1.b
of
the
regulation,
which
is
set
forth
to
page
59
of
the
appendix,
acquires
that
to
be
eligible
for
a
bonus.
a
service
member
must
have
completed
at
least
21
months
of
continuous
active
service
prior
to
extension
of
enlistment
and
respondents
had
not
completed
any
substantial
active
service
before
they
sign
their
extension
agreements.
in
short,
under
the
regulations
respondents
were
entitled
at
most
to
the
award
level
that
was
in
effect
on
the
days
that
they
entered
in
to
service
of
their
extension
periods.
since
the
ctm
award
level
on
those
days
was
zero,
the
navy
properly
refused
payment
of
the
variable
reenlistment
bonus.
now,
respondents
claim
however
that
paragraph
v.b.1.f
of
the
regulation
which
is
at
page
61
of
the
appendix
implies,
doesn't
state
but
implies
that
they
are
entitled
to
a
bonus,
but
that
paragraph
has
no
application
to
respondents
at
all.
it
is
designed
solely
to
the
deal
with
the
fact
that
a
90
day
in
advance
notice
is
given
before
an
award
level
is
reduced
to
terminated.
there
are
service
members
so
situated
that
upon
hearing
that
their
award
level
is
to
be
reduced
or
terminated.
they
would
be
able
to
obtain
an
early
discharge
under
the
regulations
and
re-enlist,
were
possibly
to
sign
an
extension
agreement
towards
the
end
of
their
period
of
service
and
then
enter
into
service
of
the
extended
period.
paragraph
v.b.1.f
is
simply
designed
to
prevent
such
service
members
from
obtaining
a
variable
reenlistment
bonus
based
upon
the
older
outgoing
award
level.
as
to
such
service
members,
the
purpose
of
this
provision
is
to
make
a
reduction
or
termination
of
award
level
effective
immediately
upon
the
issuance
of
the
notice.
that's
the
only
purpose
in
effect
of
this
provision.
it
does
not
apply
to
respondents
and
would
not
assist
them
even
if
it
did.
now,
i
would
concede
that
these
regulations
could
have
been
written
in
a
manner
better
calculated
to
reveal
their
objectives
to
the
nonmilitary
mind.
they
are
not
plain
on
their
face
but
they
are
interpreted
and
applied
in
a
manner
that
i
have
described.
this
court's
statement
in
a
similar
context,
in
immigration
and
naturalization
service
against
stanisic,
pertains
here
as
well,
and
i
have
a
quote
from
that
opinion.
granting
that
this
regulation
is
not
free
from
ambiguity,
we
find
it
dispositive
that
the
agency
responsible
for
promulgating
and
administering
the
regulation,
has
interpreted
it
to
apply.
the
navy's
interpretation
here
is
not
plainly
erroneous;
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
the
regulation
and
it
should
therefore
be
given
controlling
weight
in
this
litigation.
i
have
one
final
point.
respondents
argue
that
if
they
are
right
and
the
military
is
wrong
about
the
meaning
of
the
military's
own
regulations,
then
congress
acted
unconstitutionally
in
repealing
variable
reenlistment
bonus,
in
a
manner
that
deprived
payments
of
the
bonus
or
denied
payment
of
the
bonus
to
respondent
johnson.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
it
would
proceed
along
the
same
lines.
the
respondent's
theory
is
that
as
of
the
time
they
signed
the
agreement,
they
had
a
vested
right
to
a
certain
amount
and
in
so
far.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well
the
same.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
same
line
of
analysis
could
equally
well
be
applied
there.
however,
we
would
formally
resist
such
interpretations
just
as
we
do
here.
indeed,
our
point
with
regard
to
their
argument
of
unconstitutionality,
is
that,
that
is
simply
one
more
argument
in
favor
of
the
military's
interpretation.
a
military's
construction
avoids
any
constitutional
question
and
therefore
should
be
preferred
even
if
the
respondent's
competing
construction
were
otherwise
equally
plausible
which
we
submit
they
have
not
shown
it
to
be.
for
these
reasons,
we
ask
that
these
judgments
below
be
reversed.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes
it
was.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
pages
31(a)
to
33(a),
that
is
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
now,
all
that
do,
mr.
justice
white
is
to
affirm
the
denial
of
that
relief.
they
say
we
therefore
conclude
that
the
district
court
properly
limited
the
relief
in
this
case
to
the
award
of
the
bonus.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
the
district
court
may
have
said
very
much
the
same.
the
respondents
felt
it
necessary?
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
would
not
think
so
mr.
justice
white
but
the
question
is
whether
the
respondents
had
an
obligation
to
protect
their
rights
to
rescission
or
finally
a
cross
petition.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
let
me
point
out
mr.
justice
white
that
this
is
more
or
less
an
academic
discussion.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
because
each
of
the
name
well,
not
only
for
the
reason
that
i
would
hope
but
also
because
the
--
each
of
these
named
respondents
has
already
completed
all
of
his
extended
periods
so
there
would
be
no
basis
for
a
release
from
service,
if
indeed
they
are
still
in
the
service.
if
they
are
in
the
service
now,
it's
because
they
re-enlisted
or
further
extended
their
agreements
or
their
extensions
and
not
because
of
the
agreement
they
entered
into
in
this
case.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
about
the
government's
position
as
to
whether
pay
includes
bonuses
and
then
there
was
a
colloquy
which
suggested
that
the
government
had
changed
it's
position,
the
government
has
not
changed
it's
position.
all
we
ever
stipulated
was
that
the
term
pay
includes
bonuses
but
what
the
agreement
states,
is
that,
it's
in
consideration
of
the
pay
that
will
accrue
and
our
position
has
been
that
the
bonuses
were
form
of
pay
that
simply
never
accrued
as
to
the
enlisted
men.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no
we
have
no
done
so,
mr.
justice
white.
most
of
the
respondents
entered
into
their
extension
periods
before
congress
acted.
mr.
justice
white,
i
have
given
little
further
thought
crux
not
enough
to
your
question
about
the
appropriate
disposition
of
the
court
agrees
with
our
basic
position
as
to
what
the
regulations
provide,
and
i
would
concede
that
the
better
view
probably
is
that
the
petitioners
did
not
have
to
protect
their
position
by
cross
petitioning.
i
would
submit
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
if
they
are
not
entitled
to
a
money
judgment,
they
are
not
entitled
to
any
form
of
equitable
relief.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
it
sensed
there
is
a
money
judgment,
they
don't
need
any
thing
else.
our
submission
would
be
in
the
absence
of
a
money
judgment
under
the
tucker
act,
there's
no
relief
available,
it
is
outside
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
was
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
on
my
answer
to
that
mr.
justice
stevens
is
yes
or
no.
the
page
105
of
the
appendix,
there
is
a
schedule
of
award
levels
which
indicates
that
some
award
levels
decreased,
some
increased
and
some
stayed
the
same
over
a
period
of
several
years.
however,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
establishes
what
the
navy's
treatment
was
but
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
navy
has
consistently
administered
the
regulation
so
that
when
the
award
level
went
up,
a
man
was
entitled
to
the
larger
bonus,
when
it
went
down,
he
was
entitled
to
a
smaller
bonus.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well
i
think
it
was
a
very...
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
not
--
i
think
the
court,
the
court's
allusions
to
the
legislative
history
were
based
upon
statements
that
were
made
with
respect
to
reenlistments
and
not
with
respect
to
extensions
of
enlistment.
there
was
a
language
in
the
legislative
history
which
indicated
that
the
bonus
would
become
available
at
the
decision
point,
that
was
the
decision
point
of
reenlistment
which
was
at
the
end
of
the
original
enlistment
period.
there
is
no
indication
in
legislative
history
that
these
congressmen
ever
considered
the
application
of
the
program
to
the
extensions
of
enlistment
which
presented
a
very
different
kind
of
problem.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
again
mr.
justice
stevens,
yes
and
no.
mr.
chief
justice
asked
me
a
similar
question
during
my
opening
argument
and
i
said
that
the
same
line
of
analysis
could
be
argued
to
suggest
that
the
level
of
the
pay
upon
original
enlistment
was
fixed,
and
the
same
while
the
respondents
argued
that
there
bonus
was
fixed.
now,
if
a
court
accepted
that
argument
then
the
same
consequences
would
flow
that
is,
there
might
be
a
constitutional
barrier
to
reduction.
now,
that's
first
half
of
the
answer,
second
half
is
that
they
are
talking
about
vesting
in
a
peculiar
sense,
they
are
not
saying
that
they
would
be
entitled
to
the
bonus
if
they
never
serve
there
extension
periods,
that
is,
they
are
not
really
talking
about
the
vesting
of
pay
for
the
services
already
done
but
they
are
saying
that
they
had
a
vested
contract
right
for
quid
pro
quo
once
they
performed
the
service.
so,
it's
a
little
different
from
pay
for
service
which
has
already
been
done
but
it
is
analogous.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well
mr.
justice
stevens,
we
would
argued
that
just
as
the
congress
can
reduce
the
pay,
the
congress
or
the
navy
with
under
delegated
responsibility
can
reduce
the
award
level.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct,
your
honor.
thank
you.
