mr.
canby,
you
have
emphasized
the
modest-means
type
of
client.
the
firm
was
also
in
the
business
of
representing
plaintiffs
in
personal-injury
cases.
did
they
draw
any
line
with
respect
to
the
economic
status
of
that
type
of
client?
unknown
speaker
mr.
canby,
in
endeavoring
to
have
some
conception
of
the
scope
of
the
first
amendment
right
that
you
are
setting,
you
have
been
asked
questions
about
the
type
of
advertisements.
would
there
be
any
limitation
as
to
the
means?
what
about
television,
for
example?
unknown
speaker
it
is
often
said
in
our
profession
that
the
best
place
to
reach
prospective
personal-injury
plaintiffs
is
in
the
hospital.
what
do
you
think
of,
say,
handbills
that
had
the
information
you
said
a
little
while
ago
would
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
that
is,
the
number
of
successful
verdicts
and
the
average
size
of
verdicts
being
handed
out
in
the
emergency
room?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
last
term’s
case
said
as
much,
didn't
it
?
unknown
speaker
in
pharmacy
--
beg
your
pardon?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
trend,
though,
in
the
legal
profession
has
been
just
in
the
opposite
direction,
hasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
a
hundred
years
ago.
lawyers
did
advertise,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
routinely
or
standard
operating
procedure?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
reproduction
of
the
ad
as
it
appeared
in
the
paper
someplace?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if,
say,
the
legislature
of
colorado
suddenly
rears
back
and
passes
a
law
that
says
there
shall
be
no
price
advertising
or
any
other
kind
of
advertising
by
lawyers,
and
the
lawyers
live
up
to
it
as
a
group?
unknown
speaker
well,
even
if
parker
was
not
available,
how
would
you
prove
a
sherman
act
violation
if
lawyers
just
obeyed
that
law?
so
they
do
not
agree
to
anything;
they
just
live
up
to
the
rule.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
if
the
first
amendment
compels
the
inclusion
that
you
suggest,
then
where
do
these
limits
come
from,
then?
unknown
speaker
they
certainly
do
not
come
from
the
first
amendment.
where
do
they
come
from?
unknown
speaker
since
when
under
the
first
amendment
is
a
governmental
body,
be
it
judicial
or
executive
or
legislative,
allowed
to
regulate
speech?
unknown
speaker
there
has
been
no
question
for
something
less
than
a
year.
a
year
ago,
there
would
have
been
a
great
question
whether
a
merchant
had
any
first
amendment
right
at
all
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
quite
obviously.
but
i
understand
this
is
a
court
that
decides
questions
of
federal
constitutional
or
statutory
law.
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
requires
arizona
to
do
something
else,
and
it
did.
and
if
it
does,
then
it
requires
arizona
to
allow
lawyers
to
advertise.
but,
now,
where
do
all
these
limitations
come
from
in
the
federal
law,
constitutional
or
statutory?
unknown
speaker
you
think
it
is
up
to
us
to
say
that?
where
does
our
power
come
from?
unknown
speaker
arizona,
as
my
brother
powell
has
pointed
out,
does
not
really
mean
what
it
has
said,
does
it?
it
does
not
ban
the
circulation
of
martindale-hubbell
in
the
state
of
arizona.
unknown
speaker
well,
where
does
that
come
from,
mr.
friedman?
unknown
speaker
where
does
it
come
from?
unknown
speaker
and
one
of
them
may
be
to
advertise
at
all,
if
what
you
say
is
correct.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
where
do
these
limitations
come
from?
they
either
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
do
this
short
of
defrauding
people
or
being
deceptive
or
false,
or
they
do
not.
where
in
the
constitution
or
the
federal
law,
the
federal
constitution
or
any
federal
statute,
do
these
limitations
come
from?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you
are
proposing
is
a
considerably
more
arbitrary
standard
than
the
one
that
arizona
has
adapted.
once
it
has
been
recognized
that
there
is
a
first
amendment
right
to
speak
or
to
write,
where
anywhere
has
there
ever
been
found
any
permissible
limitation
upon
it
so
long
as
it
is
true?
unknown
speaker
where?
i
would
like
you
an
answer
to
that
question.
unknown
speaker
is
there
not
a
first
amendment
right
to
speak
the
truth?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
then
how
can
you
have
any
limitations
if
you
are
correct
about
the
first
amendment
referring
this,
where
does
any
limitation
come
from
that
allows
any
governmental
agency,
executive,
legislative
or
judicial,
to
impose
any
limitations
on
lawyers’
rights
to
speak
the
truth
when
they
advertise,
including
saying,
"i
have
been
practicing
divorce
law
for
20
years
and
am
the
most
experienced
divorce
lawyer
in
this
community"?
unknown
speaker
and
here
are
my
fees,
and
they
are
no
higher
lawyer
than
any
lawyer's
in
town.
unknown
speaker
that
is
just
a
bait-and-switch
trick.
we
are
not
talking
about
that.
we
are
talking
about…
well,
you
can
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
