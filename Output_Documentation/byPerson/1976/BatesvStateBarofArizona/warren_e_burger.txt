chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
76-316,
bates
and
others
against
the
state
bar
of
arizona.
mr.
canby,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
the
files,
mr.
canby,
or
you
mean
the
potential
clients?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
suggesting,
i
take
it,
that
they
could
advertise
that
they
got
a
$200,000
verdict,
that
that
would
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
let
us
test
out
your
view
of
the
scope
of
the
first
amendment
protection.
could
they,
in
describing
in
an
ad
the
settlement
for
$200,000,
document
it
with
a
copy
of
the
check,
the
settlement
check?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
a
case
where
there
is
what
is
regarded
by
some
as
an
opening
wedge,
don't
you
think
these
are
appropriate
areas
to
explore?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
the
function
of
a
pharmacist
is
to
be
equated
with
the
function
of
a
physician
or
a
lawyer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
haven't
bar
associations
as
such
for
many,
many
years
issued
free
brochures
explaining
the
rule
problem
and
explaining
joint
tenancy,
explaining
the
problems
of
acquiring
and
financing
the
purchase
of
a
home
and
issuing
them
in
public
places
without
directing
anyone
to
a
particular
lawyer,
but
merely
acquainting
the
public
with
these
kinds
of
services?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
has
been
very
common,
hasn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yeah,
but
don't
these
same
bar
associations,
usually
the
state
and
local
as
distinguished
from
the
american
bar,
publish
recommended
schedules
of
fees,
not
binding
as
in
the
goldfarb
case,
but
merely
communicating
to
the
public
that
the
examination
of
a
title
has
a
certain
range,
that
probate
of
an
estate
has
a
certain
figure,
preparing
a
deed
or
a
will,
etcetera?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
it
would
advance
professionalism
if
your
clients,
having
put
the
ad
which
they
used,
then
another
group
of
lawyers
would
publish
an
ad
10%
less?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
advance
professionalism?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
canby.
mr.
friedman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
derogatory
about
that
comparative
statement
if
it
is
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
us
try
balancing
on
that
score.
you
mentioned
the
balancing
process.
suppose
this
lawyer
or
office
has
advertised
wills
for
$25,
and
then
they
put
along
with
the
supermarket
ads
an
ad
of
their
own
saying,
“$25
wills,
saturday
only:
$14.95”?
do
you
think
they
could
do
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
does
anybody
know
what
a
$25
will
is
in
the
first
place?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
friedman.
mr.
frank,
we
will
not
ask
you
to
go
for
a
minute-and-a-half.
we
will
let
you
begin
at
1:00.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
frank?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
one
answer
to
one
of
those
questions
about
michigan
is
that
michigan
has
elected
to
experiment
in
one
way,
and
arizona
has
elected
to
experiment
in
another
way.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
frank.
you
have
a
few
minutes
left.
do
you
have
anything
further,
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
76-316,
bates
and
others
against
the
state
bar
of
arizona
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
