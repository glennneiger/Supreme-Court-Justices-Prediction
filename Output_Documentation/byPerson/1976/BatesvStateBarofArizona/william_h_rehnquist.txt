yet
you
would
not
say
that
the
state
could
prohibit
a
candidate
for
office
from
canvassing
in
a
hospital,
just
because
the
people
might
not
be
in
the
best
possible
shape,
would
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
because
you
think
the
protection
accorded
to
this
type
of
speech
is
less
than
that
accorded
to
political
speech?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
canby,
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
you
thought
perhaps
there
was
some
difference
in
the
protection
accorded
to
commercial
speech
than
to
traditional
political
speech.
do
you
think
the
doctrine
of
overbreadth
would
apply
with
all
its
force
in
the
area
of
commercial
speech
the
way
it
does
with
ideological
or
political
speech?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
the
first
amendment
prohibit
derogatory
communication?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
principle
of
the
federal
constitution
says
that
arizona
cannot
do
what
it
did,
but
another
state
could
prohibit
derogatory
advertisement
by
one
lawyer
about
another?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
it
precisely
that
you
feel
is
misleading
about
the
divorce
and
$175
plus
$20
court
costs?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
where
do
you
get
that
out
of
the
ad?
are
you
saying
that
that
is
not
a
very
reasonable
fee?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
not
in
the
ad,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
frank,
there
was
a
…
at
least
when
i
practiced
in
phoenix,
the
county
attorney
would
do
adoptions;
but
people
who
could
afford
adoption
would
go
and
have
a
private
lawyer
do
them,
and
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
every
private
attorney
who
was
consulted
necessarily
said,
“well,
you
could
do
just
as
well
with
the
county
attorney”.
