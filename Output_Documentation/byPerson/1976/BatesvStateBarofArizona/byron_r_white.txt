justice
byron
r.
white
well,
have
the
restrictions,
however,
originated
with
the
state
or
with
the
bar?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
may
have;
but
the
bar
has
not
any
choice
any
more,
has
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yeah;
but
they
did
originally.
they
could
have
filed
a
new
tariff.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
bar
cannot
here
file
some
new
rules
with
the
supreme
court
and
automatically
have
to
up
one
of
these
rules.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
it
is
state-prescribed,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
cantor
case,
once
you
filed,
you
had
to
do
what
you
said
you
were
going
to
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
had
to
live
up
to
your
own
tariff.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
could
have
discontinued
the
tariff.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
cannot
send
a
notice
to
the
supreme
court
here
and
say,
“by
the
way,
we
are
now
discontinuing
the
rules
you
published”.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
would
be
left
of
parker
if
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
would
be
left
of
parker?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
makes
your
sherman
act
case
weaker,
doesn't
it?
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
be
too
quick
to
bring
suit.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
do
not
even
say
that
it
is
a
bargain;
they
just
say
it
is
reasonable.
justice
byron
r.
white
better
you
stay
close
to
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
…and
watch
your
embarrass-able
words
before
you
say
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
good.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
frank,
what
if
the
united
mine
workers
or
the
united
transportation
union
published
this
same
ad,
and
at
the
bottom
it
said
the
united
mine
workers
legal
clinic
and
then,
under
it,
it
gave
the
name
of
the
lawyers,
otherwise
published
the
same
ad,
and
they
just
circulated
it
in
their
union
newspaper,
published
it
in
their
union
newspaper
to
all
of
their
members
or
to
anybody
else
who
wanted
to
buy
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
saying
that
is
something
that
we
would
not
call
a
group
legal
service
exactly;
but
the
union…
well,
your
answer
is
that
you
would
not
say
that
the
arizona
rules
would
forbid
this
advertisement
published
by
a
union.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
the
ad
that
i
spoke
about
published
by
the
union
would
be
constitutionally
protected
under
our
cases
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
i
am
just
wondering
what
your
view
was
of
the
constitutional
protection
or
not
for
an
ad
as
i
described.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
mr.
frank,
i
suppose
this
is
arguable
in
a
way.
didn't
this
morning
some
local
paper
carry
an
article
that
the
michigan
court
is
approving
this
very
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
precisely,
the
reason
i
made
the
observation
was
because
of
your
parade
of
horribles;
that
all
i
asked
was
whether
it
was
not
arguable
because
one
state
goes
one
way
and
another
state
goes
the
other
way.
