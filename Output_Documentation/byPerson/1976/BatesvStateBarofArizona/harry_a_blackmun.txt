what
is
inherently
misleading
about
the
ad
in
this
case
on
page
409?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
is
my
initial
question.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
we
need
to
get
there,
mr.
frank.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
and
it
is
the
so-called
lawyers
advertising
case.
the
appellants,
mr.
bates
and
mr.
o'steen
are
licensed
attorneys
and
members
of
the
integrated
arizona
state
bar.
wthey
were
charged
in
the
complaint
filed
by
the
president
of
the
state
bar
with
violating
a
disciplinary
rule
of
the
supreme
court
of
arizona.
that
rule
prohibited
attorneys
from
advertising
in
newspapers
or
other
media.
the
complaint
was
based
upon
a
newspaper
advertisement,
the
appellants
had
inserted
for
their
so-called
legal
clinic.
the
ad
stated
that
they
were
offering
legal
services
at
very
reasonable
rates
and
they
listed
their
fees
for
certain
services
namely
uncontested
divorces
and
uncontested
adoptions,
simple
personal
bankruptcies
and
changes
of
name.
as
their
defense
to
the
charge,
the
appellants
claim
that
the
disciplinary
rule
violated
the
first
two
actions
of
the
sherman
act
because
of
its
tendency
to
limit
competition.
but
they
further
claim
that
it
also
infringe
upon
their
first
amendment
rights.
the
arizona
supreme
court
rejected
these
claims
and
upheld
the
conclusion
of
the
bar
committee
that
the
appellants
had
violated
the
disciplinary
rule.
we
hold
first
that
the
restraint
upon
attorney
advertising
imposed
by
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
fact
was
the
exercise
of
the
power
of
the
state
over
the
practice
of
law.
and
as
such,
under
a
case
entitled
parker
against
brown
decided
here
some
years
ago,
the
restraint
is
not
subject
to
attack
under
the
sherman
act.
to
this
extent,
therefore,
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
is
affirmed.
we
then
turned
to
the
first
amendment
issue.
we
note
that
commercial
speech
was
held
in
the
virginia
pharmacy
board
case
of
last
term
to
be
entitled
to
some
first
amendment
protection.
in
as
much
as
it
serves
individual
and
society's
interest
in
assuring,
informed
and
reliable
decision
making.
we
hold
in
this
case
that
the
justifications
advanced
by
the
arizona
state
bar
are
not
adequate
to
support
the
suppression
of
all
advertising
by
attorneys.
we
note
that
this
case
does
not
involve
any
question
concerning
personal
solicitation
by
lawyers
(inaudible)
chasing
in
the
light
nor
does
it
involve
advertising
claims
as
to
the
quality
of
legal
services.
it
concerns
instead
only
the
question
whether
lawyers
may
constitutionally
advertise
the
prices
at
which
certain
routine
services
will
be
performed.
advertising
legal
services,
in
our
view,
is
not
inherently
misleading.
routine
services
lend
themselves
to
advertising
and
this
is
demonstrated
by
the
legal
services
program
of
the
arizona
state
bar
itself.
advertising
of
course
does
not
provide
a
complete
foundation
on
which
a
person
selects
an
attorney,
but
it
would
be
peculiar
to
deny
the
consumer
at
least
some
relevant
information
needed
for
an
informed
decision.
it
is
entirely
possible
that
advertising
will
serve
to
reduce
and
not
advanced
the
cause
of
legal
services
to
the
consumer.
on
the
record
of
this
case,
the
appellant's
advertisement
is
not
misleading
and
it
falls
within
the
scope,
the
first
amendment
protection.
the
term
legal
clinic
is
understood
to
refer
to
an
operation
like
that
of
the
appellant's
that
is
geared
to
provide
standardized
and
multiple
services
and
the
claim
to
provide
services
at
very
reasonable
prices
is
not
misleading
for
the
advertised
fee
is
in
line
with
customary
charges
in
the
area.
the
dissent
of
course
takes
the
position
not
--
this
will
effect
profound
changes
in
the
practice
of
law.
perhaps,
this
is
so
nearly
all
cases
of
constitutional
adjudication.
so,
the
latter
aspect
of
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
is
thus
reversed.
in
summary
then,
the
state
court's
judgment
is
infer
--
is
affirmed
on
the
antitrust
issue
and
is
reversed
on
the
record
on
the
first
amendment
issue.
in
that
part
of
the
opinion
filed
today
which
concerns
the
antitrust
issue,
all
members
of
the
court
joined.
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
powell
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
each
have
filed
an
opinion
dissenting
on
the
first
amendment
issue.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
joined
mr.
justice
powell
in
his
opinion.
