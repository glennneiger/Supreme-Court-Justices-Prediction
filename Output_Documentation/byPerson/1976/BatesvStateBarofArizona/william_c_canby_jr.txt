mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
about
two
lawyers
who
advertised
in
their
local
newspaper
and
were
disciplined
for
it;
but
as
i
intend
to
show,
it
is
also
a
case
about
the
delivery
of
legal
services
in
the
united
states.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
a
disciplinary
rule,
rule
2-101b
of
the
code
of
professional
responsibility,
which
is
embodied
in
a
rule
of
the
arizona
supreme
court,
violates
the
first
amendment
or
is
invalid
for
conflict
with
the
federal
antitrust
laws.
the
rule
itself
prohibits
any
attorney
from
publicizing
himself
or
his
partner
in
local
newspapers,
among
other
things.
it
has
set
forth
at
pages
3
and
4
of
our
brief.
the
facts
which
gave
rise
to
this
controversy
concern
a
very
unusual
law
practice.
mr.
bates
and
mr.
o’steen,
by
graduation
from
law
school,
worked
for
about
a
year-and-a-half,
for
the
maricopa
county
legal
aid
society
and
then
set
out
on
their
own
to
develop
a
very
special
kind
of
practice,
which
they
intended
to
aim
at
that
group
of
people
who
were
above
the
poverty
line
and
not
eligible
for
legal
services,
but
are
below
the
level
of
affluence
which
the
regular
users
at
the
legal
profession
enjoy.
consequently,
they
set
up
a
firm,
which
was
organized
to
do
a
business
depending
greatly
on
systems
where
the
attorneys
set
up
forms
of
their
own
design,
used
paralegals
to
a
great
extent,
used
automated
equipment
and,
most
important
of
all,
charged
very
low
profit
for
each
case.
as
a
result,
we
were
able
to
offer
a
fairly
narrow
line
of
services
which
lent
themselves
to
standardization;
but
they
found
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
getting
the
word
out,
and
in
the
course
of
a
two-year
period,
their
practice
did
not
thrive.
they
wanted
to
make
it
thrive
and
they
wanted
to
produce
the
services
and
they
wanted
to
have
clients,
so
they
put
together
an
advertisement,
which
appears
at
page
409
of
the
printed
appendix,
and
they
run
it
in
the
arizona
republic,
a
newspaper
of
general
circulation
in
phoenix,
arizona.
this
advertisement,
among
other
things,
advertised
uncontested
divorce
--
both
spouses
signed
papers
--
$175
plus
a
stated
court
filing
fee;
name
change
for
a
stated
fee;
uncontested
adoptions
and
bankruptcies
for
stated
fees;
and
an
uncontested
divorce
where
the
attorneys
would
prepare
all
the
papers
for
a
person
who
was
intent
upon
getting
his
own
divorce
himself.
this
was
published,
and
as
a
result
of
it,
disciplinary
proceedings
were
started
by
the
state
bar
of
arizona.
hearings
were
held
and
the
administrative
committee
which
first
heard
the
case
found
that
they
had
violated
the
law.
they
permitted
a
full
record
to
be
made,
but
their
finding
was
simply
that
the
rule
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
had
been
breached
by
the
publication
and
that
the
two
appellants
here
should
be
suspended
from
practice
for
six
months.
on
appeal
to
the
board
of
governors
of
the
state
bar
of
arizona,
this
was
modified
to
a
week’s
suspension
for
each.
and
when
it
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
arizona,
that
was
changed
to
a
censure;
but
the
finding
that
they
had
violated
the
canon
was
upheld
and
a
censure
was
ordered
by
the
supreme
court
of
arizona.
the
supreme
court,
in
their
opinion,
specifically
rejected
the
first
amendment
claims
and
the
antitrust
claims
which
appellants
here
had
asserted.
now,
a
restraint
on
this
kind
of
advertising,
of
course,
strikes
appellants
as
a
severe
interference,
a
classic
interference
with
the
communication
of
information
to
their
clients.
and
as
i
say,
their
clients
were
ones
who
are
perhaps
the
great
middle
mass,
by
and
large,
of
the
population.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
potential
clients,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
i
might
add
that
an
american
bar
foundation
study,
the
curran
and
spalding
study
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
indicates
that
one-third
of
all
the
adult
americans
never
use
a
lawyer
in
their
lifetimes;
another
third
do
so
once.
and
it
also
indicates
that
a
great
number
of
people
in
the
united
states
do
not
know
how
to
find
a
lawyer,
they
do
not
have
regular
contacts
with
lawyers,
and
they
also
do
not
have
a
very
good
idea,
many
of
them,
of
what
lawyers
charge
for
their
services.
and
in
fact,
a
good
portion
of
them
tend
to
overestimate
the
cost
of
lawyer
services.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice,
and
i
hasten
to
add
that
they
did
not
draw
an
economic
line
with
any
client.
the
record
indicates
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
their
clients
range
from
the
poverty
level
practically
up
to
very
few
with
incomes
over
$25,000
a
year
for
a
family.
but
they
do
not
have
a
policy
of
turning
away
people
who
have
a
greater
income
than
that
for
any
case.
the
first
contention
which
we
assert
here
is
that
this
provision
violates
the
first
amendment.
and
of
course
on
a
commercial-speech
doctrine,
we
rely
very
heavily
on
bigelow
v.
virginia,
which
upheld
the
first
amendment
right
to
advertise
an
abortion
service,
and
we
also
rely,
of
course,
very
heavily
on
the
decision
last
term
in
virginia
state
board
of
pharmacy,
which
held
that
there
was
a
first
amendment
right
for
drug-price
advertising,
that
case
being
brought
by
consumers
who
wanted
to
know
drug
prices.
but
i
submit
that
all
of
the
elements
which
the
court
found
commanded
first
amendment
protection
in
virginia
state
board
of
pharmacy
are
present
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
the
great
public
interest
in
the
economic
allocation
of
resources,
the
importance
of
economic
information,
and
particularly
price
information,
to
the
consumer
in
making
up
his
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
to
avail
himself
of
legal
services
and
what
attorney
to
get
are
served
by
the
kind
of
ad
that
my
clients
ran.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
i
think
they
would
if
it
is
not
deceptive
and
misleading,
and
i
believe
that
--
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
i
think
that
the
bar,
mr.
justice
stevens,
could
regulate
in
ways
that
the
federal
trade
commission
sometimes
regulates
to
make
a
full
disclosure.
in
other
words,
if
they
gave
ten
recent
recoveries
that
were
very
high,
this,
it
seems
to
me,
could
be
misleading
if
it
gave
a
false
idea
of
their
practice,
or
it
might
even
be
argued
that
it
overstates
the
role
of
the
attorneys
in
getting
those
judgments.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
i
think
there
would
be
a
first
amendment
right
to
make
that
kind
of
an
advertisement,
assuming
that
the
last
20
cases
was
the
beginning
of
a
run
of
good
luck.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
and
that
is
correct,
and
no
advertising
by
an
individual
attorney
in
a
newspaper
is
permitted
in
arizona
or,
indeed,
in
the
classified
sections.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
i
do
not.
in
fact,
i
am
sure
that
false
and
misleading
advertising
can
be
regulated.
i
am
also
--
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
i
think
that
there
is
a
danger
of
under-disclosure
in
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
think
that
the
bar
could
reasonably
regulate
to
require
full
disclosure
effects
like
that.
i
think
occasionally
a
single
fact
that
is
advertised
could
be
misleading,
even
if
technically
accurate.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
here
again,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
my
opinion
they
could
if
it
were
not
misleading
in
other
ways;
but,
of
course,
no
one
has
to
go
that
far
to
rule
that
the
ad
which
the
appellants
put
in
the
newspaper
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
undoubtedly
they
are,
and
that
is
why
i
say
i
think
that
a
good
deal
more
advertising
and
a
good
variety
of
it
would
be
entitled
to
first
amendment
protection.
there
are
others
who
do
not
go
that
far,
but
i
do.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
i
think
that
television
advertising
would
be
protected.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
tests
of
virginia
state
board
of
pharmacy
are:
does
this
serve
to
get
information
to
the
consumer?
is
there
a
first
amendment
right
to
convey
this
information?
and
television,
particularly
with
a
certain
segment
of
the
population,
would
be
a
very
good
way
to
get
the
availability
of
certain
legal
services
made
known
to
the
population.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
i
think
that
is
purely
prohibitable.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
time-place-and-manner
regulation
that
could
be
made
here,
and
it
could
be
based
on
a
high
interest
in
protecting
people
who
are
in
various
stages
of
physical
disarray,
really,
from
being
importune
by
advertisements.
i
think
it
is
important
to
get
information
to
people,
but
i
do
not
think
that
hospital
emergency
rooms
and
scene
of
accidents
is
the
place.
and
if
the
bar
prohibited
that,
but
let
general
public
advertising
go,
it
seems
to
me
that
kind
of
a
narrow
regulation
could
be
permitted.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
i
think
it
is.
i
think
that
the
circulation
of
a
commercial
handbill
is
entitled
certainly
to
less
protection
than
first
amendment
speech
of
a
political
nature,
and
i
would
not
assume
the
same
test.
for
instance,
false
and
deceptive
political
speech
is
obviously
not
prohibitable;
but
i
do
think,
however,
that
false
and
deceptive
advertising
should
be
and
that
it
is
not
protected
by
first
amendment.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
yes,
it
did.
i
do
not
think
that
the…
and
of
course
in
your
concurrence,
that
was
clearly
--
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
yeah,
that
was
clearly
stated
in
more
than
one
of
the
opinions
in
that
case
that
because
of
the
likelihood
that
commercial
speech
will
not
be
killed
and
the
fact
that
the
facts
are
really
within
the
peculiar
knowledge
of
the
advertiser
that
probably
some
different
rules
can
be
made,
and
false
and
misleading
advertising
regulation
is
one
of
them.
i
think
it
is
important
to
add
in
this
case,
too,
that
the
practice
of
appellants
does
serve
consumers,
and
it
seems
that
it
serves
them
in
obtaining
what
really
is
a
constitutional
right.
i
think
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
legal
services.
and
extending
the
access
to
legal
services
is
really
a
way
of
saying
that
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
recipients
will
accord
with
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
would-be
commercial
speakers
in
this
case.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
physicians
and
lawyers
clearly
have
a
much
greater
variety
of
services
they
dispense,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
more
judgment
involved;
but
the
american
medical
association,
for
instance,
has
taken
a
position
contrary
to
the
state
of
arizona
here.
the
governing
council
of
the
american
medical
association
this
year
held
that
physicians
can
advertise
fees
for
specific
services,
and
that
ruling
is
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
their
amicus
brief,
the
american
medical
association.
in
other
words,
they
did
not
see
it
as
inconsistent
with
professionalism
of
the
most
discretionary
sort
to
advertise
a
set
fee
for
a
set
service
and,
in
fact,
set
fees
are
even
permitted
by
the
american
bar
association.
in
its
1975
amendments,
it
authorized
attorneys
to
advertise
in
the
classified
pages
that
a
written
list
of
fees
is
available
on
request.
well,
if
an
attorney
can
make
up
a
written
list
of
fees
and
give
it
to
people
who
see
reference
to
it
in
an
advertisement,
i
see
no
reason
why
that
written
list
cannot
simply
be
advertised
and
make
the
consumer
have
that
information
at
much
greater
ease.
but
the
set
fee
is
still
there
and
it
has
written
down,
and
it
has
chosen
by
the
attorney.
on
the
side
of
the
state
in
the
first
amendment
question,
there
is
really
here
quite
a
burden
to
be
sustained.
i
think
that
bigelow
and
the
state
board
of
pharmacy
are
clear
that
there
is
a
very
high
state
interest
required
that
since
the
protection
does
extend
to
commercial
speech,
the
first
amendment
tilts
in
favor
of
publication
and
a
state
really
ought
to
show
interests
which
justify
the
prohibition
of
all
of
this
information.
the
first
justification,
which
is
heavily
urged
by
the
appellee
in
this
case,
is
that
this
is
really
a
form
of
barratry;
that
if
advertisements
are
widespread,
then
people
who
would
not
have
availed
themselves
of
legal
services
will
do
so.
and
if
that
is
the
definition
of
barratry,
then
we
simply
have
to
face
that
and
say
we
are
guilty,
because
ignorance
is
not
a
very
good
way
to
control
who
uses
the
legal
system.
and
to
say
that
those
who
know
they
have
causes
of
action
or
those
who
know
they
need
wills
or
those
who
know
they
need
divorces
can
get
them,
but
those
who
do
not
know
this
cannot
and
that
that
is
the
way
we
control
the
flow
of
litigation
or
the
use
of
legal
services.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
they
have.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
they
have,
and
you
are
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
this
has
been
going
on
for
several
years.
but
the
great
need
is
still
there.
the
studies,
the
preliminary
report's
a
couple
of
years
old,
and
the
final
report
of
this
legal-needs-of-the-public
survey
is
due
for
publication
by
the
american
bar
foundation
this
coming
february,
next
month,
and
it
indicates
that
the
people
really
are
not
being
reached
by
this
information.
and
they
are
certainly
not
being
reached
by
price
information.
people
do
not
know
what
this
costs,
and
it
is
very
burdensome
to
find
out
what
it
costs.
and
when
you
find
out
what
a
lawyer
is
going
to
charge,
there
is
no
way
of
telling
what
other
lawyers
charge
for
anything
like
this
service.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
this,
and
i
do
not
know
of
it
is
being
done
in
arizona.
it
may
well
have
been
done
elsewhere.
i
just
cannot
answer
the
question.
i
do
not
know.
it
seems
to
me
there
might
be
antitrust
problems
with
those
fees
if
it
is
used
as
a
means
of
agreeing
on
fees
to
be
charged;
but
to
my
knowledge,
at
least
in
the
record
in
this
case,
there
is
no
indication
this
has
been
done.
i
think
the
reason
that
these
institutional
efforts,
although
they
are
very
helpful,
really
have
not
succeeded
are
two:
one
is
that
they
do
not
permit
enough
information
to
be
conveyed;
and
second,
it
is
a
limited
effort,
because
it
is
really
not
directly
in
the
economic
interest
of
those
disseminating
the
information
to
disseminate
it.
and
because
of
that,
the
efforts
do
not
work
as
well
as
they
do
when
the
person
who
is
disseminating
has
as
personal
interest
in
getting
the
message
across.
another
argument
that
is
used
by
the
state,
although
i
should
say
before
i
bring
this
one
up
that
we
are
talking
here
about
the
state
interests
which
might
support
this
kind
of
a
regulation.
we
are
not
talking
about
anything
in
this
record,
really,
because
the
appellants
were
charged
not
with
deceptive
advertising
or
not
with
poor
quality
of
services
or
anything
else;
they
were
charged
with
advertising.
and
the
findings
all
along
the
way
simply
said
they
advertised,
they
are
disciplined.
so
we
are
really
simply
anticipating
arguments
the
state
might
make
for
a
constitutional
rule
justifying
this
kind
of
an
overbroad
total
ban,
and
we
submit
that
its
overbreadth
itself
is
enough
to
strike
it
down.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
i
think
that
it
would,
because
largely
when
you
say
"all
its
force",
perhaps
there
are
instances
when
it
would
not.
it
seems
to
me
when
it
is
just
speech
--
in
other
words,
the
publication
of
something
in
the
paper
--
overbreadth
is
appropriate,
and
indeed
a
great
part
of
the
opinion
in
bigelow
against
virginia
was
that
overbreadth
when
it
is
the
pure
transmission
of
a
message
is
quite
appropriate
an
approach
here,
even
though
it
is
strong
medicine.
this
ban,
for
instance,
does
not
permit
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
aba
has
said
is
permissible,
like
setting
up
a
display
box
in
the
classified
pages
giving
the
fee
for
initial
consultation.
the
aba
has
permitted
this
in
its
amendments,
which
are
in
the
appendix
at
449,
and
the
morning
press
tells
me
the
michigan
court
has
adapted
this;
but
arizona
does
not.
it
seems
to
me
that
is
an
example
of
overbreadth.
but
we
would
also
be
quite
content,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
to
stand
on
the
ad
here.
we
think
that
this
ad
is
protected,
and
we
are
very
anxious
to
establish
that
the
advertisement
of
a
fee
for
a
particular
service,
which
is,
in
fact,
held
to
and
performed
competently,
is
not
deceptive
and,
in
fact,
it
is
very
helpful
to
the
consumer
to
have
that
information.
the
arguments
that
professionalism
is
simply
inconsistent
with
advertising
might
have
been
easily
accepted
several
years
ago,
but
there
simply
is
too
much
advertising
done
now,
or
there
are
too
many
organizations
which
are
willing
to
endorse
it,
to
entertain
the
idea
that
some
other
professions
simply
cannot
operate
with
advertising.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
the
one-century
trend
certainly
has.
there
was
advertising
--
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
yes,
and
in
fact
the
first
code
of
ethics
of
any
bar
association
in
this
country,
the
alabama
bar
in
the
1880s,
specifically
stated
that
newspaper
advertisements
were
proper,
and
it
was
subsequently
after
the
american
bar
association
was
organized
after
the
turn
of
the
century
they
began
to
restrict
this.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
is
interesting
that
even
the
seed
of
the
profession
seems
to
be
changing,
too.
the
monopolies
commission
in
england
has
recommended
that
solicitors
be
permitted
to
advertise,
and
action
is
being
taken
on
that
recommendation.
the
governors
of
the
d.c.
bar
association
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
have
recommended
advertising
which
would
permit
price
advertising
by
individual
attorneys.
that
has
not
yet…
in
fact,
it
was
just
recently
submitted
to
the
district
of
columbia
courts;
there
has
been
no
action
on
that.
in
summary
of
the
first
amendment
problems,
i
think
that
all
of
the
arguments
of
the
state
really
depend
on
the
public's
not
knowing
something.
and
this
runs
afoul
of
the
virginia
state
board
of
pharmacy
strictures
that
protecting
the
public
by
keeping
it
in
ignorance
really
is
not
the
way
of
the
first
amendment.
the
question,
it
seems
to
me,
that
has
to
be
asked
in
this
case
is,
what
is
it
in
this
ad
that
the
consumers
or
the
public
really
ought
not
to
know?
apparently
it
would
be
all
right
to
put
it
in
a
written
list,
and
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
when
people
telephone
attorneys,
the
attorneys,
“set
fees"
for
things
like
uncontested
divorces.
well,
if
that
can
be
told
to
a
person
when
he
calls,
what
is
it
about
the
advertisement
that
means
that
the
public
should
not
generally
be
told
that
without
having
to
call
and
compare?
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
i
think
it
would
if
they
published
an
ad
stating
the
fees.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
i
think
it
would,
because
i
think
the
greatest
duty
of
the
profession
is
to
extend
legal
services
to
the
public
that
does
not
have
it
and
that
legal
services
have
regularly
been
available
to
a
very
restricted
portion
of
the
population.
and
i
think
that
this
kind
of
thing
would
tend,
for
one
thing
--
and
there
is
economic
expert
testimony
on
this
--
this
kind
of
advertising
will
tend
to
drive
prices
of
legal
services
down.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
at
page
409
in
the
appendix,
mr.
justice.
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
here
about
the
antitrust
portion
of
this
argument.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
well,
the
normal
rule,
i
suppose,
of
this
court
is
that
you
decide
statutory
grounds
and
avoid
constitutional
decisions
when
possible.
i
think
that
in
this
case,
the
first
amendment
argument
is
admittedly
simpler.
and
there
certainly
are
occasions
when
this
court
has
decided
a
constitutional
argument
where
there
is
a
clear
violation
of
the
constitution
without
entering
the
statutory
ground.
incidentally,
in
the
other
drug-price
case,
terry
v.
the
state
board
of
pharmacy
out
in
california,
the
three-judge
court
did
just
that.
there
were
both
first
amendment
and
antitrust
grounds
set
forth
in
that
case;
they
decided
the
first
amendment
ground
--
this
was
before
the
virginia
state
board
of
pharmacy
case
was
decided
here
--
and
then
they
said,
"we
simply
won't
reach
the
antitrust
issues".
the
antitrust
issues
in
this
case,
of
course,
revolve
primarily
around
the
state
action,
so-called
exemption
of
parker
v.
brown.
and
here,
the
justice
department,
whose
support
we
welcome
on
the
first
amendment,
takes
leave
of
us
and
takes
this
position
with
some
reluctance
and
i
can
understand
their
reluctance,
because
in
the
record
in
this
case,
for
instance,
other
professions
testified
as
to
their
practices.
the
accountants,
for
instance,
had
a
rule
against
competitive
bidding.
it
was
a
rule
of
their
national
association,
and
it
became
a
rule
of
their
state
association,
and
it
became
a
rule
of
the
state
board
of
accountancy
in
arizona:
no
competitive
bidding.
this
was
abandoned
at
the
national
level,
according
to
the
record,
under
threat
of
justice
department
action.
it
was
abandoned
at
the
state
level
by
the
state
board
when
our
state
attorney
general
wrote
an
opinion
to
the
board
that
it
violated
state
and
federal
antitrust
laws.
other
kinds
of
restraints
are
common.
the
architects,
for
instance,
who
permit
solicitation,
permit
solicitation,
but
not
price
competition.
well,
these
are
restraints
of
trade,
and
they
are
restraints
of
trade
that
regulated
professions
can
easily
get
incorporated
into
rules
of
the
profession.
and
the
restraint
is
great,
as
it
is
in
this
case.
the
parker
v.
brown,
of
course,
dealt
with
an
anticompetitive
raise
and
marketing
scheme
that
was
imposed
by
legislative
command
of
the
state.
the
evolution
of
parker
into
which
we
believe
this
case
can
be
fit
is
that
announced
in
cantor
v.
detroit
edison,
where
this
court
said
the
practice
of
furnishing
free
light
bulbs
by
a
regulated
utility
violated
the
antitrust
laws,
even
though
it
was
incorporated
in
a
tariff
which
had
been
approved
by
the
state
utilities
commission,
and
the
utility
was
not
free
under
state
law
to
deviate
from
that
practice.
now,
in
cantor,
the
cantor
case,
of
course,
is
distinguishable,
in
that
the
state
was
not
the
one
which
was
doing
the
enforcing;
it
was
a
suit
against
a
private
utility.
here,
we
are
taking
the
next
step
basically
and
trying
to
prevent
the
enforcement
of
a
restrictive
trade
practice
which
the
state
has
approved
by
adopting
this
rule,
which
was
clearly
originated
by
the
aba,
both
its
predecessor
and
the
present
one,
and
adopting
it
into
a
rule
of
the
state
supreme
court.
the
language
which,
it
seems
to
me,
the
government
is
overlooking
in
cantor
is
that
which
deals
with
the
fact
--
and
this
was
dealt
with
also
in
goldfarb
--
that
whether
or
not
the
state
is
involved
there
is
a
threshold
question.
and
if
the
state
is
not
involved,
as
this
court
really
did
not
feel
it
was
in
goldfarb,
then
there
is
no
immunity.
but
that
is
the
threshold
question.
of
course,
the
state
is
involved
here,
the
court
is
enforcing
this.
well,
then,
what
question
comes
after
the
threshold,
and
that
is,
is
this
rule
really
necessary
to
make
the
regulatory
system
work?
how
badly
does
it
interfere
with
the
system
of
free
competition
that
the
sherman
act
has
mandated?
and
what
interests
of
the
state
make
this
rule
necessary,
and
what
ones
do
not?
and
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
the
same
interests
which
we
find
to
be
weak
when
they
are
measured
as
a
first
amendment
part
of
the
state’s
balance
are
equally
weak
when
they
are
measured
in
the
antitrust
balance.
there
is
no
question
here,
of
course,
that
this
is
a
restraint,
and
that
is
the
restraint
of
price
advertising
affects
the
price
structure,
a
more
or
less
classic
antitrust
restraint.
the
fact
that
the
state
is
enforcing
it
is
not
the
whole
answer.
for
instance,
the
state
was
enforcing
its
own
rule
basically,
or
at
least
a
state
command
was
involved,
in
the
schwegman
case.
the
schwegman
case
was
an
attempt
basically
to
invalidate
the
state
non-signer
law
under
the
fair-trade
acts,
and
it
succeeded.
the
state
command
was
invalid,
because
it
conflicted
with
the
command
of
the
sherman
act;
in
other
words,
that
fair-trade
practice
did
not
fall
within
an
exemption
to
the
sherman
act
that
congress
had
created.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
the
restrictions
here
originated
with
the
american
bar
association.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
they
have
not,
but
i
would
submit
neither
did
the
utility
in
cantor.
they
no
longer
had
a
choice.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
that
is
true.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
it
certainly
would
not
be
automatic.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
it
is
state-commanded,
that
is
correct.
but
it
--
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
that
is
true.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
i
believe,
though,
that
those
tariffs
--
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
i
believe
that
technically,
that
has
to
be
approved
by
the
--
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
no,
they
certainly
cannot.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
well,
there
would
be
less
left
of
parker.
i
think
my
--
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
well,
in
the
first
place,
where
there
is
a
high
state
interest
--
and
i
think
the
best
example,
i
suppose,
of
what
would
be
left
of
parker
is
the
natural
monopoly
which
public
utilities
are
an
example
of
--
if
the
state
wants
to
regulate
the
price
structure
of
attorneys,
then
fine.
i
think
that
if
they
decide,
for
instance,
either
to
hire
the
lawyers
or
to
put
the
lawyers
under
the
state
corporation
commission
and
regulate
their
rates,
then
there
is
a
very
considerable
argument
that
the
state
has
substituted
interests
which
restrain
the
excesses
of
monopoly
for
those
which
otherwise
are
provided
by
the
sherman
act.
here,
of
course,
the
state
command
frees
lawyers
from
a
certain
kind
of
price
competition;
but
it
does
not
exert
any
real
pressure
on
the
lawyers
to
keep
their
rates
down.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
i
think
that
would
violate
the
sherman
act;
but
i
must
say
that
that
is
a
much
weaker
case,
because
there,
at
least
the
political
arm
of
the
state
has
presumably
considered
the
--
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
that
is
the
importance,
it
seems
to
me,
of
the
fact
that
there
is
more
than
a
mere
request
by
the
bar
in
this
case
to
pass
this
rule.
this
rule
is
--
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
if
i
were
bringing
an
antitrust
action,
i
imagine
that
i
would
bring
it
against
the
state
bar.
but
it
seems
to
me
it
is
a
different
--
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
it
is
a
very
different
question.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
the
state
bar
might
well
be
exempted
as
a
matter
of
fairness
from
damages
if
it
had
no
option
but
to
obey
the
law.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
well,
perhaps,
or
at
least
if
enforcement
was
attempted,
then
to
defend
on
that
ground,
and
it
seems
to
me
if
the
michigan
utilities
commission
the
day
after
the
cantor
decision
came
down
said,
“all
right,
now,
we
are
holding
the
utility
to
its
tariff,
because
our
state
law
says
you
have
to
be
held
to
it”,
then
i
think
the
utility
would
have
a
defense
against
that.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
an
intervening
decision
of
this
court
would
provide
that.
otherwise,
of
course,
this
court
and
the
utilities
commission
will
be
commanding
inconsistent
conduct,
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
supremacy
clause
here
simply
dictates
that
the
federal
command
prevail,
if
i
answered
mr.
justice
white’s
question.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
no,
right,
i
will
not.
in
summary,
i
will
simply
say
that
in
our
view,
both
the
antitrust
laws
and
the
first
amendment
apply,
and
a
balancing
test
applies.
the
balance
here
in
favor
of
public
information
of
this
kind
is
tremendous,
and
the
state’s
interests
to
the
contrary
are
not.
the
decision
should
be
reversed.
i
reserve
any
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
just
two
points.
the
material
where
the
name
change
is
discussed
appears
on
pages
111
and
113
of
the
record,
where
mr.
o’steen
is
asked
whether
a
lawyer
is
needed
at
all
with
a
client.
mr.
william
c.
canby,
jr.
well,
111
of
the
record,
and
i
am
going
on
to
113.
i
will
paraphrase;
i
will
not
read
this.
and
he
said,
“well,
no,
except
when
it
can
be
done
by
administrative
procedure,
going
to
a
department
or
something,
then
we
send
the
client
on
his
way
with
instructions
how
to
do
it”.
then
the
next
question
is,
“yes,
but
nothing
in
the
law
requires
a
person
who
is
getting
a
judicial
name
change
to
go
to
a
lawyer.
three
out
of
ten
in
this
county
go
to
the
court,
go
to
the
clerk
and
do
it
themselves.
what
do
you
say,
then,
to
that?
the
answer
was,
“well,
we
do
not
know
how
well
it
has
done,
we
do
not
know
where
instructions
exist
for
this
kind
of
thing;
but
we
do
not
feel
that
we
have
to
advise
the
people
that
they
could
do
it
themselves.”
now,
the
final
answer
to
this,
of
course,
is
that
it
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
ad
itself.
if
the
bar
wants
to
make
a
general
rule
that
every
attorney
should
advise
every
client
that
all
litigants
are
entitled
to
handle
their
matters
themselves,
then
i
think
that
is
perfectly
proper
and
all
lawyers
can
be
instructed
to
do
it.
but
it
does
not
go
to
the
question
of
what
has
been
advertised
in
this
case.
the
ad
itself
offers
a
service,
and
it
is
not
deceptive.
the
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
has
to
do
with
the
comment
that
the
court
below
found
the
charge
misleading.
the
only
mention
about
the
expense
of
a
divorce
in
the
lower
court’s
opinion,
the
supreme
court
of
arizona’s
opinion,
is
on
12a
of
our
jurisdictional
statement,
which
is
that
blue
that
is
in
the
appendix,
and
it
says,
“mr.
justice
gordon,
concurring
separately,
says,
‘moreover,
i
am
able
to
foresee
instances
in
which
the
$175
fee
quoted
for
this
service
would
be
unreasonably
high.’”
my
clients,
in
addition
to
the
hours
they
put
in,
the
brief
hours
on
a
divorce,
have
put
in,
as
the
record
shows,
many,
many
hours
devising
systems
so
that
they
can
handle
it
this
briefly,
and
they
also
use
paralegal
time.
if
divorces
can
be
had
more
cheaply
than
this,
let
another
attorney
advertise
that
fact,
and
the
public
will
be
even
better
served
than
they
are
by
my
clients.
thank
you.
