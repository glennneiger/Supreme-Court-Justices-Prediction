mr.
canby,
the
only
thing
this
case
involved
is
the
total
and
complete
ban
on
advertising.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
all
we
have
here
now.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
take
the
position
that
it
cannot
be
regulated.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
about
simply
saying,
“anything
you
can
do,
i
can
do
better”?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
frank,
getting
back
to
the
present
time,
if
there
is
a
person
in
arizona
who
wants
to
devolve
and
he
is
a
perfectly
ordinary
person,
i
want
to
compare
him
with
the
well-educated,
extremely
wealthy
person
who
has
an
antitrust
matter.
he
could
use
martindale-hubbell
to
find
out
all
he
wants.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
the
poor
man
who
has
got
$195
to
get
a
divorce,
how
would
he
go
about
finding
a
lawyer
in
arizona?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
would
the
man
find
the
lawyer
referral
service?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
where
is
that
advertised?
justice
thurgood
marshall
good.
is
it
done?
justice
thurgood
marshall
regularly?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
did
not
get
to
this
man.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
they
are
just
wasting
their
money
with
this
ad.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
are
making
money
from
this
ad.
justice
thurgood
marshall
hundreds
of
years
ago,
you
had
law
offices
with
a
maximum
of
three
lawyers
with
an
income
of
about
$10,000
a
year,
and
now
what
are
we
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
therefore,
(inaudible)
for
nothing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
was
a
different
day
and
age,
obviously.
