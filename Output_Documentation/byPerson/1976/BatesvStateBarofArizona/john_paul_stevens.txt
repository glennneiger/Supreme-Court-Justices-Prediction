justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
canby,
would
they
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
advertise
the
quality
of
their
services?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
example,
in
the
personal-injury
phase
of
it,
would
they
have
a
right
to
give
a
list
of
their
recent
verdicts
they
just
recovered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
it
is
completely
factual.
the
last
twenty
cases
we
tried
had
the
following
results:
nine
of
them
were
settled,
four
of
them
we
lost,
and
in
seven
of
them
we
got
$200,000
verdicts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
arizona
have
an
integrated
bar?
justice
john
paul
stevens
every
lawyer
is
a
member
of
the
bar.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
do
that,
mr.
canby,
would
you
tell
us
which
issue
you
think
we
should
decide
first
of
the
two?
the
government
has
a
different
view
than
the
litigants,
apparently.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
canby,
if
instead
of
a
defense
you
were
bringing
an
antitrust
action,
who
would
you
name
as
defendants
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
bring
it
against
the
state
bar?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
the
state
bare
and
supreme
court
rule
remain
in
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
supposing
you
won
your
case
against
the
state
bar,
and
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
said
“we
don't
care
what
happened
to
that
litigation.
we
still
have
this
rule.
we
are
going
to
disbar
people
who
do
not
follow
our
rule”.
wouldn't
you
have
to
name
the
members
of
the
supreme
court
in
order
to
prevail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
utility
have
a
defense
that
the
tariff
it
proposed
itself
was
unlawful?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
friedman,
are
you
not
suggesting
a
distinction
based
squarely
on
the
content
of
the
advertising,
the
content
of
the
speech?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
agree
that
your
position
must
fail
unless
the
court
is
willing
to
state
that
the
content
may
be
the
basis
for
differentiating
between
kinds
of
protected
speech
and
unprotected
speech?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
you
are
taking
two
different
positions.
one
time,
you
and
mr.
canby
both
kept
saying
you
can
prohibit
false
and
misleading.
but
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked
you
about
derogatory.
it
can
be
truthfully
derogatory.
so
your
only
line
surely
is
not
the
false-and-misleading
line,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
gave
an
example
earlier
about
a
merchant,
something
to
the
effect
of
saying
he
is
the
best
in
town
or
something
like
that.
are
you
suggesting
that
that
could
be
prohibited?
for
example,
could
the
state
say
that
a
lawyer
may
not
advertise
that
his
fees
are
very
reasonable,
which
is
precisely
what
this
person
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
very
reasonable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
permissible
under
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
some
statement
of
opinion
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
other
than
the
mere
fact.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
frank,
what
is
the
prevailing
fee
in
this
community
for
an
uncontested
divorce?
justice
john
paul
stevens
judged
by
the
standards
of
the
community
rather
than
their
own
hourly
charge,
it
is
a
reasonable
fee,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
what
is
so
misleading
about
the
rest
of
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
must
admit,
mr.
frank,
i
am
puzzled
by
your
being
willing
to
admit
that
may
be
constitutionally
protected,
but
this
clearly
may
not
be,
and
the
only
distinction
is
that
there
is
pecuniary
gain
as
a
motivation
for
the
person
who
publishes
here.
is
that
a
constitutional
distinction
in
first
amendment
terms?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
precisely
this
ad
by
a
union.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
would
not
permit
the
credit
union
to
do
that,
would
you?
