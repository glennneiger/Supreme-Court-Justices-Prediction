mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
let
me
address
myself
directly
to
that
question,
mr.
justice
powell.
i
think
we
start
with
the
basic
issue
that
has
been
suggested
in
this
case
is
a
narrow
one,
whether
there
can
be
an
absolute
ban
on
all
advertising.
and
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
this
absolute
ban
imposed
by
the
state
of
arizona
goes
beyond
the
permissible
limits
of
the
first
amendment;
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
first
amendment
because
of
the
strong
interest
in
members
of
the
public
in
getting
information
about
legal
services,
both
their
availability
and
their
cost.
now,
we
also,
of
course,
recognize
there
is
a
very
strong
interest
in
ensuring
high
ethical
standards
at
the
bar,
as
this
court
has
indicated,
both
because
of
the
critical
role
that
lawyers
play
in
the
administration
of
justice
and
their
role
as
officers
of
the
court.
obviously,
lawyers
do
not
stand
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
the
average
merchant
who
is
selling
a
standardized
product.
he
is
selling
a
special
service.
but
we
think
that
the
first
amendment
requires
that
any
restraints
that
the
state
does
impose
upon
the
dissemination
of
information
by
lawyers
to
the
public
as
potential
clients
cannot
go
beyond
what
is
necessary
adequately
to
protect
the
state’s
interests.
now,
that
ultimate
balancing
in
first
amendment
cases
has
to
be
done
by
the
courts.
of
course,
the
state
has
the
power
to
prevent
misleading
and
deceptive,
false
advertising
by
lawyers;
and
the
state
has
a
broader
authority
than
that.
there
may
be
many
things
that
a
merchant
can
do
that
it
is
not
proper
for
a
lawyer
to
do,
because
it
is
important
to
this
country
that
the
people
of
this
country
have
a
high
regard
for
the
legal
profession
because
of
its
critical
role
in
the
administration
of
justice.
but
we
do
not
think
that
because
of
the
importance
that
the
lawyers
play
in
the
legal
system
and
in
the
operation
of
our
country
that
this
means
the
bar
can
say
there
can
be
no
advertising
at
all.
we
do
not
think
the
bar
can
go
that
far.
now,
there
are
problems,
of
course,
of
policing
these
things.
and
i
might
just
add
in
passing
that
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief
that
there
are
some
recent
indications
of
suggestions
of
what
would
be
permissible.
we
are
not
espousing
any
of
these.
all
that
we
cite
these
for
is
to
point
out
that
the
problem
is
not
to
us
an
all-or-nothing
problem.
it
is
not
either
there
can
be
no
advertising
or
that
there
is
got
to
be
enormous
discretion.
there
have
to
be
some
limitations.
now,
one
of
the
problems
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that,
it
seems
to
me
again,
would
depend
on
what
is
said.
if
statements
with
respect
to
the
quality
of
services
are
misleading,
the
state
can
prohibit
them.
i
do
not
think
a
lawyer
could
publish
an
ad
saying,
“come
to
me,
i
am
a
better
lawyer
than
anyone
else
in
town”.
it
seems
to
me
that
is
not
the
kind
of
statement,
although
permissible
to
a
merchant,
that
a
lawyer
could
properly
state.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
the
derogatory
thing
would
present
problems
to
me.
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
permissible
if
the
ad
stated
merely
that
“if
you
need
a
divorce,
we
have
been
practicing
divorce
law
for
20
years”.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
derogatory,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
suggestion
is
somehow
that
we
are
better
than
they
are,
and
it
is
the
negative
suggestion
against
them.
it
seems
to
me
this
gets
into
the
area
where
i
think
there
may
be
problems
with
respect
to
what
is
permissible.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no.
it
is
not
the
first
amendment
prohibits
derogatory
communications,
mr.
justice.
we
think
it
is
that
the
first
amendment
does
permit
lawyers
to
get
to
the
public
their
position
that
they
are
available
to
the
public
and
indicating
what
their
services
are
and
what
they
will
charge
for
them.
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
do
not
think
that
would
be
permissible,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
the
limits
come
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
the
limits
come,
i
think,
mr.
justice,
from
the
role
of
the
lawyers
and
the
differences,
the
kind
of
differences
that
exist
with
respect
to
what
is
an
appropriate
kind
of
regulation
of
the
legal
profession.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
is
not
regulating
speech
in
that
sense.
what
it
is
saying
is
that
there
are
certain
kinds
of
speech
and
certain
things
done
by
lawyers
are
not
consistent
with
the
standards
that
we
accept
of
lawyers.
if
i
may
give
a
simple
example,
i
suppose
there
is
no
question
under
the
first
amendment
that
a
merchant
can
put
at
the
most
far-reaching
and
the
most
sweeping
claims
for
his
stuff:
“come
to
our
store,
the
best
store
in
town.
don't
patronize
anyone
else,”
that
kind
of
thing.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that,
i
think,
now
has
to
be
accepted
that
there
is
a
first
amendment
protection
to
commercial
speech.
but
the
fact
that
there
is
a
commercial-speech
protection
under
the
first
amendment
does
not
necessarily
mean,
as
this
court
itself
has
suggested
in
those
cases,
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
numbers
of
the
professions
that
necessarily
there
has
to
be
the
same
sweep
to
the
protection
they
have
as
is
to
be
given
to
the
common
garden
variety
of
commercial
speech;
that
is,
the
things
that
can
be
said
about
advertising
prescription
drugs
are
not
necessarily
the
same
things
that
can
be
said
when
a
lawyer
brings
his
message
to
the
public.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
it
comes
in,
mr.
justice,
in
the
balancing
process,
in
determining
just
how
far
the
state
can
go
in
restraint.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
in
the
first
instance,
it
has
to
be
the
state
that
makes
the
judgment,
and
the
state
in
this
case
has
not
made
any
judgment
other
than
the
judgment
that
there
shall
be
no
advertising
at
all
by
lawyers
in
the
state
of
arizona,
and
that
is
what
we
think
is
bad,
this
absolute
ban.
now,
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
that
the
absolute
ban
is
bad,
that
does
not
mean
that
you
have
to
go
all
the
way
and
say
that
there
can
be
absolutely
no
limits
at
all.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
but
what
they
are
really
talking
about,
it
seems
to
me,
is
advertising
directly
to
the
public.
martindale-hubbell
is
basically,
i
think,
directed
to
members
of
the
bar.
i
think
what
arizona
does
do
is
bar
any
advertising
by
lawyers
to
the
public,
anything
that
the
lawyers
do
that
gets
to
the
public,
the
lawyer’s
position
as
announcing
the
availability
of
their
services
and
indicating
the
costs
at
which
they
will
furnish
them.
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
i
think
it
comes
from
the
recognition
that
the
first
amendment
protection
given
to
commercial
advertising
by
lawyers
does
not
necessarily
have
the
full
force
and
effect
as
the
first
amendment
protection
given
to
commercial
advertising
by
merchants,
that
it
is
protected.
it
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
but
the
scope
of
the
protection
is
not
as
sweeping
as
the
protection
given
to
the
more
traditional
kinds
of
commercial
speech.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
think
i
am,
mr.
justice,
and
i
think
the
court
last
year
in
the
american
mini
theatres'
case
recognized
that
there
may
be
situations
in
which
you
can
refer
to
the
content
of
the
speech.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
no,
mr.
justice.
there
are
situations,
it
seems
to
me,
very
clearly
where
the
content
of
the
speech
does
control
the
measure
to
which
it
can
be
regulated,
and
in
the
field
of
commercial
advertising,
the
court
pointed
out
last
year
that
while
there
was
a
first
amendment
right
to
distribute
and
announce
the
prices
at
which
prescription
drugs
were
being
sold,
it
did
not
follow
from
that
that
there
was
a
first
amendment
right
to
make
false
and
misleading
statements.
so
it
seems
to
me
the
court
does
look
to
see
what
the
content
is.
if
it
is
false
and
misleading,
certainly
the
maker
of
these
statements
cannot
claim
that
it
is
constitutionally
protected.
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it
goes
somewhat
beyond
that.
i
do
not
know
precisely
at
what
point
the
line
has
to
be
drawn.
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
line
that
in
the
first
instance
has
to
be
drawn
by
the
state,
because
the
state
has
the
broad
regulatory
authority
over
the
legal
profession.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
this
person
merely
stated
reasonable
fees.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
very
reasonable
fees,
very
reasonable
fees.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
that
kind
of
a
statement
is
permissible.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
some
statement,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
some
statement.
but,
again,
i
think
it
has
to
take
into
account
the
whole
matrix
of
the
whole
relationship
of
the
bar
to
the
public.
that
is,
that
are
certain
things,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
state
fairly
can
conclude
are
not
properly
to
be
done
by
members
of
the
bar
that
could
be
done
by
nonprofessionals.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
where
we
disagree,
of
course.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
these
limitations
derive,
mr.
justice,
from
the
nature
of
the
legal
profession
and
from
the
fact
that
traditionally
in
evaluating
first
amendment
rights
there
has
to
be
this
balancing
test,
and
when
you
consider
a
limitation
on
all
advertising
as
distinguished
from
the
limitation
on
certain
types
of
advertising,
it
seems
to
me
the
state’s
interest
in
restricting
certain
forms
of
advertising
may
be
much,
much
greater
than
the
state’s
interest
in
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
i
think,
mr.
justice,
i
have
suggested
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
let
me
see
if
i
can
answer
it
this
way,
that
in
determining
what
the
first
amendment
right
is,
when
we
say
there
is
a
first
amendment
right
to
advertise,
that
does
not
mean
a
first
amendment
right
to
advertise
any
conceivable
thing.
and
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
there
is.
there
is
a
first
amendment
right,
of
course,
to
speak
the
truth.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
the
latter,
it
seems
to
me,
i
think
they
could
say.
i
think
they
could
say
the
latter.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think,
up
to
that
point,
yes;
up
to
that
point,
yes.
but
at
some
point,
it
seems
to
me
they
may
go
beyond
this,
because
at
some
point
they
are
likely
to
say
things
that
seemingly
are
wholly
factual,
but
in
fact
may
not
be
that
factual.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
if
they
were
prepared
for
any
client
who
came
in
on
saturday
to
draw
a
will
for
$14.95,
although
$
25
is
the
regular
price,
they
could
state
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
may
be
something
deceptive
if,
in
fact,
they
never
draw
wills
for
$25;
but
if
they
say
“a
simple
will,
$25”
and
in
fact
they
are
drawing
wills
for
people
for
$25,
it
seems
to
me
they
could
state
that.
and
i
think
they
could
also
state
that
on
saturdays,
a
special
for
the
man
who
is
working
five
days
a
week
and
cannot
come
to
see
us
during
the
week,
$14.95,
i
think
they
could
say
that
as
long
as
it
is
truthful.
if,
in
fact,
when
people
came
in
for
their
$25
wills
or
their
$14.95
wills,
they
quickly
told
them,
“well,
your
will
is
much
more
complicated.
it
is
going
to
cost
you
$150”,
that
would
seem
to
be
misleading
in
the
classical,
traditional
sense.
but
i
do
not
think
they
can
be
stopped
for
telling
the
truth.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
i
would
just
like
very
briefly
to
speak
about
the
parker
v.
brown
point,
which
has
been
discussed
briefly
here.
it
seems
to
us
that
what
the
cases
in
this
court
starting
with
parker
v.
brown
and
going
through
cantor
have
established
is
one
fundamental
principle,
that
if
the
action
challenges
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
is,
in
fact,
action
of
the
state
or
compelled
by
the
state,
it
is
a
state
action
not
subject
to
the
strictures
of
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
in
this
case,
unlike
the
virginia
case
where
all
that
happened
with
regard
to
the
fee
schedules
was
that
the
state
approved
them
or
suggested
them
or
authorized
them,
here,
the
state
commands
it.
it
is
a
rule
of
the
state
supreme
court
of
arizona,
and
if
i
may
just
complete
this,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
state
supreme
court
is
the
one
that
exercises
the
function
of
the
state
of
arizona
in
dealing
with
lawyer
discipline.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
bar
association
suggests
something
and
the
state
supreme
court
says,
“if
you
want
to
do
it,
go
ahead
and
do
it.”
here,
as
has
been
brought
out,
it
is
the
state
supreme
court,
the
final
arbiter
on
these
matters,
that
has
ordered
the
lawyers
in
arizona
not
to
advertise.
it
is
the
state
supreme
court
that
has
disciplined
these
lawyers
for
advertising.
the
state
is
speaking
in
this
matter
through
the
only
agency
by
which
it
functions
with
respect
to
disciplining
of
lawyers
and
that,
it
seems
to
us,
is
state
action
under
any
standard
of
the
term
and
is
therefore
not
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
thank
you.
