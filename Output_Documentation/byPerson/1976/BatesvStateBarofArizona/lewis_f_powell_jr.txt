justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
friedman,
before
you
commence,
let
me
share
with
you
at
least
my
primary
concern
of
this
case.
i
think
all
lawyers
agree
that
the
problem
being
discussed
here
today
is
a
very
serious
one,
important
for
the
public
and
the
profession,
and
the
delivery
of
legal
services
in
our
country
obviously
is
defective.
the
problem
that
i
think
concerns
all
of
us
on
this
bench
and
at
the
bar
is
what
to
do
about
it.
lawyers
have
advertised
to
some
extent
always.
anybody
who
knows
about
martindale
can
find
out
where
lawyers
went
to
school,
how
old
they
are
and,
until
recently
at
least,
who
their
clients
were.
they
can
also
find
in
what
areas
of
specialization
lawyers
are
professed
to
be
competent
in
their
practice.
i
hope
you
will
have
time
to
address
not
just
the
barebones
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
can
be
any
advertising,
i
do
not
perceive
that
as
the
basic
issue
in
this
case.
the
question
is
what
limits
rationally,
fairly,
constitutionally
may
be
imposed;
who
imposes
those
limits,
and
how
are
they
enforced?
these
are
the
broader
contours
of
the
problem.
we
could
decide
this
case
and
may
very
well
do
it
in
a
very
narrow
way,
but
that
would
not
advance
the
resolution
of
the
fundamental
problem.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
interrupt
you
just
a
minute
right
there?
i
think
we
start
from
the
premise
that
some
advertising
already
is
permitted.
so
the
total
ban
issue
as
i
perceive
it
is
not
here.
we
do
have
an
extent
of
the
ban
under
the
arizona
rule.
but
mr.
canby
stated
quite
explicitly
that
he
thought
the
first
amendment
entitled
lawyers
to
talk
about
the
quality
of
their
services.
what
is
the
government’s
position
on
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
in
this
case,
a
competing
lawyer
had
published
an
ad
saying,
“the
partners
in
this
clinic
have
been
practicing
divorce
law
on
a
part-time
basis
for
four
years.
i
am
a
specialist
in
divorce
law.
i
have
been
practicing
it
for
20
years.
my
fees
are
the
same".
is
that
all
right?
