mr.
john
p.
frank
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
p.
frank
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
from
mr.
canby
and
the
amici
and
the
government,
i
draw
a
certain
common
syllogism.
the
major
premise
is
that
not
enough
people
receive
legal
services.
the
minor
premise
is
that
solicitation
by
advertising
will
greatly
aid
the
deprived.
the
conclusion
is
that
the
first
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
requires
that
advertising
be
permitted.
in
response
to
this,
my
own
single
greatest
obligation
from
all
of
the
sources
on
which
we
have
drawn
is
to
mr.
frederick
ballard
of
the
bar
of
this
city,
who
almost,
mr.
justice
powell,
in
response
to
your
comment,
in
making
a
speech
of
his
own
on
this
subject
directed
me
to
a
singularly
opposite
aphorism
by
h.l.
mencken,
which
i
repeat:
"for
every
serious
problem,
there
is
a
solution
which
is
simple,
direct
and
wrong."
while
we
acknowledge
the
sincerity
of
those
who
with
biblical
fervor
contemplate
the
vision
of
striking
the
rock
and
having
a
stream
of
pure
water
come
out
to
slightly
first
of
the
multitude,
we
frankly
find
it
astonishing
that
they
can
be
so
blind
to
the
cataclysmic
flood
which
they
seek
to
unleash.
what
you
are
asked
to
believe
is
that
if
you
give
your
permission,
the
nation
will
be
dotted
with
noble
souls
who
will,
by
advertising,
communicate
to
those
otherwise
unaware
their
desire
to
perform
worthwhile
and
needed
service
at
very
low
costs.
this
frankly
visionary
speculation
overlooks
the
human
experience,
which
tells
us
that
you
would
be
unleashing
quite
a
different
flood.
the
plain
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
advertising
law
business
leads
to
incompetence,
at
best.
in
the
experience
of
the
patent
office,
which
tried
it
and
after
full
hearings
concluded
in
formal
opinion
that
this
was
exactly
true,
is
good
documentation.
but
to
put
it
bluntly,
it
leads
to
lying,
cheating
and
swindling
at
its
worst.
we
do
not
have
to
guess
about
this;
we
know.
we
know
because,
as
justice
stewart
reminded
us
this
morning,
there
was
no
limitation
on
advertising
in
the
19th
century,
and
what
i
am
talking
about
is
exactly
what
happened.
the
only
notes
we
have
of
an
oral
argument
that
was
ever
made
by
abraham
lincoln
at
the
trial
court
involved
a
case
of
the
widow
of
a
revolutionary
war
veteran
who
was
represented
by
what
was
then
called
a
claims
agent,
who
was
permitted
to
get
his
business
by
solicitation,
and
he
was
doing
what
within
our
own
time
would
be
regarded
as
legal
work.
lincoln
took
the
widow’s
case
without
charge
to
try
to
recover
some
of
what
that
agent
had
kept.
and
perhaps
some
of
you
have
seen
the
notes
of
that
argument
and
can
imagine
the
immense
force
of
the
underlying
phrase
at
the
end
of
it,
which
says,
“skin
the
defendant”.
it
is
not
any
wonder
that
lincoln
told
the
law
students,
“never
stir
up
litigation.
a
worse
man
can
scarcely
be
found
than
one
who
does
this.
a
moral
tone
ought
to
be
infused
into
the
profession
which
would
drive
such
men
out
of
it”.
now,
i
want
to
make
very
clear
that
for
those
of
us
who
oppose
a
ban
on
solicitation,
we
do
not
regard
this
as
the
pieties
of
the
dead
to
which
we
are
somehow
paying
lip
service.
the
other
side
says
in
its
brief
that
what
a
different
era
called
runners
and
cappers
are
quite
anachronisms
which
do
not
need
to
concern
us
any
more.
we
do
not
see
it
that
way.
we
say
that
the
lawyer
who
directly
or
true
his
intermediary
goes
to
the
hospital
to
line
up
the
injured
to
sue
is
unworthy
of
the
profession
and,
in
mr.
lincoln’s
phrase,
“ought
to
be
driven
out
of
it”.
mr.
canby
says
that
he
would
like
to
seek
controls
on
that
score,
but
his
client
said
at
trial
in
response
to
the
question:
“do
you
believe
you
have
the
same
first
amendment
right
to
go
to
the
hospital
or
give
your
cards
at
the
scene
of
the
accident?”
was,
after
some
waffling,
"i
think
that
it
may
well
be
true
that
if
tested,
a
lawyer
has
a
constitutional
right
to
engage
in
that
solicitation".
no
lawyer
of
integrity
--
i
put
it
this
strongly
--
no
lawyer
of
integrity
can
read
our
recitation
of
what
actually
happens
with
actual
solicitation
--
we
took
the
cases
from
california
as
an
example
--
frankly
without
his
stomach
turning.
even
when
our
guard
is
all
the
way
up,
there
are
persons
who
solicit
the
widow
and
the
orphan
and
the
sick
to
bring
actions
which
are,
first
and
foremost,
intended
to
line
the
pockets
of
those
who
represent
them.
we
say
that
this
is
absolutely
bad
business.
we
take
as
our
contemporary
champion
chief
justice
roger
traynor,
who
wisely
said,
speaking
of
the
very
persons
that
our
friends
here
wish
to
help,
the
persons
who
are
inexperienced,
who
do
not
know
about
legal
council,
who
are
having
their
first
run
up.
what
chief
justice
traynor
said
was,
“clients
who
need
legal
assistance
only
rarely,
and
are
therefore
inexperienced
in
selecting
counsel,
may
be
induced
by
advertisement
to
select
unsuitable
counsel,
with
consequent
injury
not
only
to
themselves,
but
to
the
reputation
to
the
bar
as
a
whole".
now,
the
argument
which
you
heard
this
morning,
the
counterargument
is
that
all
these
evils
can
be
avoided
by
permitting
only
honest
advertising
and
by
controlling
the
deceptive.
if
there
is
one
element
of
sanctimonious
pap
in
this
whole
case,
that
is
it.
the
argument
fails
for
three
reasons:
first,
advertising
to
be
gravely
undesirable
does
not
have
to
be
misleading.
there
were
examples
mentioned
this
morning.
exuberant
puffing
of
the
raps
beaten
here
or
the
six
$100,000
verdicts
last
year
may
be
true
without
being
very
desirable;
second,
the
hustle
is
peculiarly
likely
to
push
people
where
they
should
not
go
when
there
is
no
real
likelihood
that
they
can
appraise
their
own
situation.
this
is
a
matter
to
which
i
want
to
return;
the
third,
and
the
main
point
i
would
develop
now,
the
whole
talk
of
controlling
misleading
advertising
by
criminal
or
regulatory
sanctions
is
itself
the
biggest
hoax,
the
biggest
misleading
of
all.
the
plain
truth
is
--
and
i
direct
myself,
justice
marshall,
to
the
exchange
you
had
about,
are
we
talking
only
about
absolute
control
--
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
prohibition
of
legal
advertising
in
newspapers,
in
this
case
by
people
who
are
trying
to
make
money
out
of
them,
and
that
is
prohibited
in
our
state.
and
i
point
this
out,
that
in
all
of
the
briefs
you
have
had
--
mr.
canby,
the
government
and
the
rest
of
them
--
no
one
has
ever
yet
told
you
how
these
controls
are
supposed
to
function.
no
one
gives
you
more
than
an
amenable
invocation
of
honesty.
the
granddaddy
of
all
false
professional
advertising,
of
course,
is
medicine.
the
spellbinding
patent-medicine
vendor
with
his
snake-oil
cures
is
a
19th
century
legend,
which
we
allow
to
become
amusing
because
it
is
so
remote.
we
have
created
a
food
and
drug
administration
which
works
in
a
kind
of
a
way,
sluggishly
and
expensively,
to
control
the
abuses
of
the
national
drug
concerns,
few
in
number,
which
manufacture
the
bulk
of
the
products
you
spoke
about
in
the
prescription-drug
case.
but
the
only
protection
the
public
gets
from
misleading
advertising
at
the
grassroots
level
is
the
ethical
system
of
the
doctors
themselves.
i
level
a
direct
challenge
to
our
adversaries
here:
if
you
allow
a
general
pattern
of
advertising
--
and
what
you
do
here
for
lawyers
you
are
going
to
do
for
accountants
and
for
doctors;
they
are
in
the
same
pot
--
if
you
allow
this,
just
exactly
who
is
going
to
look
at
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
ads
which
may
come
out?
who
is
to
appraise
whether
they
are
misleading?
who
is
to
do
anything
about
it?
the
institutions
do
not
exist.
there
is
no
procedure,
no
structure.
all
we
are
doing
is
opening
the
gate
and
saying,
“let
her
come”.
now,
justice
rehnquist,
you
raised
in
colloquy
the
argument
of
overbreadth,
which
justice
canby
talked
about,
the
argument
that
the
ban
is
too
broad.
chief
justice
hughes,
than
whom
no
more
towering
debatteur
of
free
speech
ever
sat
here,
told
us
in
a
similar
case
that
society
did
not
need
to
pick
and
choose
which
professional
ads
are
invidious
and
which
are
not.
this
court
in
the
recent
mini
theatres'
case
observed
that
in
commercial
speech,
the
content
of
a
particular
advertisement
may
determine
the
extent
of
its
protection.
chief
justice
hughes
had
something
to
say
about
content.
he
told
us
that
professional
advertising
is
what
it
is:
inherently
misleading.
he
expressly
rejected
the
concept
that
control
of
professional-service
advertising
must
be
as
narrow
as
possible
to
fit
only
precise
abuses.
mr.
john
p.
frank
this
is
a
good
example,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
i
would
like
to
be
specific
about
it.
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
pointed
out
instances
in
which
even
this
ad,
which
is
a
little
squib
of
an
ad
meant
to
be
a
test
case
and
they
make
it
as
perfect
as
they
can;
so
they
tell
us
first
of
all
that
this
was
a
legal
clinic,
and
they
somehow
imply
that
there
is
something
virtue
or
cheaper
about
it,
virtuous
or
inexpensive.
but
when
we
cross-examine
them
on
the
stand,
there
is
no
conception
of
what
a
legal
clinic
is;
it
is
a
meaningless
term,
simply
a
kind
of
an
invocation
of
nothingness.
more
than
that,
they
are
offering
particularly
economical
services,
particularly
beneficial
prices.
take,
for
example,
the
one
of
their
consent
divorces.
they
have
also
told
us
on
this
record
that
they
charge
$40
an
hour
for
their
time.
they
have
told
us
on
this
record
that
their
divorces
take
between
an
hour-and-a-half
and
three
hours'
maximum.
and
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
observed
that
this
is
outright
misleading
on
its
face,
this
indication
of
some
great
bargain
for
these
so-called
consent
divorces.
the
one
on
which
there
is
the
greatest
tone
of
misleading,
a
matter
to
which
i
may
come
back,
is
to
talk
about
name
changes,
and
that
also
was
picked
up
by
the
supreme
court
below.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
anybody
in
our
town
who
wants
to
can
go
and
get
his
name
changed
for
nothing,
and
you
do
not
need
legal
services
for
this.
so
the
question
of
whether
somehow
this
is
a
great
benefaction
to
mankind
is
highly
doubtful.
mr.
john
p.
frank
the
point
that
is
misleading
is
the
suggestion
that
somehow
this
is
some
kind
of
a
grand
public-service
bargain.
mr.
john
p.
frank
i
am
saying
that
given
the
standards
of
these
people,
who
are
purporting
to
be
entitled
to
special
dispensation
because
they
are
being
so
generous
to
the
lower
middle
class,
that
the
answer
is,
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
john
p.
frank
it
is
when
you
connect
it
with
the
notion
of
the
legal
clinic
and
the
special
service
and
that
somehow
we
are
prized
and
special.
i
agree,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
i
cannot
make
this
ad
into
a
devastating
falsehood;
it
is
not,
it
is
marginal.
the
point
that
i
want
to
make
is
that
it
is
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
yes.
it
is,
and
i
am
answering
it
as
hard
and
as
solid
as
i
know
how.
mr.
john
p.
frank
all
right.
what
i
am
saying,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
is
that
the
three
items
which
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
which
we
suggest
are
at
least
marginally
misleading
are,
number
one,
the
suggestion
that
there
is
something
called
a
legal
clinic.
on
the
record,
it
is
apparent
that
this
is
an
empty
term,
which
somehow
imputes
special
value
and
special
economy.
on
examination
as
to
what
the
legal
clinic
is
--
and
there
is
a
full-scale
record
before
you
showing
it
--
it
turns
out
that
what
a
legal
clinic
does
is
what
every
office
in
phoenix
does:
that
they
use
paralegals,
that
they
have
forms
and
so
on.
secondly,
the
supreme
court
below
broadly
suggested,
and
i
think
correctly,
that
the
suggestion
that
this
is
somehow
a
great
bargain
price
for
divorces
is
misleading,
especially
measured
by
their
own
hourly
rate
and
the
time
that
it
takes
for
them
to
do
it.
and
finally
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
they
say
it
is
reasonable;
but
i
think,
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
i
am
sorry,
thank
you.
mr.
john
p.
frank
all
right,
posterity
will
not
be
let
down.
mr.
john
p.
frank
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
that
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
whole
tone
of
this
advertisement,
the
whole
tone
of
the
brief,
is
that
somehow
we
are
doing
something
very
special
for
the
community,
we
are
being
just
great
folks,
and
we
are
giving
you
wonderful
bargains.
now,
on
the
matter,
if
i
may
conclude,
as
to
the
name
change
and
then
pick
that
up,
sir,
on
the
name-change
point,
what
the
attorney
said
when
he
was
examined
on
the
stand
about
the
fact
that
you
can
get
those
for
nothing,
you
do
not
need
to
pay
$95,
is,
"i
feel
under
no
obligation
to
tell
people
that
they
can
get
services
cheaper
somewhere
else".
i
submit
that
the
tone
of
the
thing
is
not
quite
what
is
being
presented
to
you
here
today
of
some
great
virtue
and
economy.
mr.
justice
stevens?
mr.
john
p.
frank
let
me
answer
by
saying
first
that
the
difficulty
arises
because
the
term
"uncontested
divorce"
is
a
sliding
term.
i
would
say
uncontested
divorce
could
run,
depending
upon
how
uncontested
they
really
are,
anywhere
from
around
$150
to
around
$300.
i
have
handled
them
myself
for
anything
in
that
whole
zone
in
the
course
of
the
years
from
time
to
time.
this
is
a
low
price,
but
it
is
not
some
spectacular
bargain.
mr.
john
p.
frank
it
is
certainly
a
moderate
fee.
mr.
john
p.
frank
well,
again,
i
come
back
to
the
fact
--
and
this
is
simply
the
best
i
can
do
with
it,
mr.
justice
stevens
--
that
i
think
that
even
in
this
simple
ad
they
are
trying
to
suggest
some
extra-special,
and
there
is
not
anything
that
extra-special
here.
in
the
williamson
and
lee
optical
case,
this
court
in
a
unanimous
opinion
by
justice
douglas,
which
followed
chief
justice
hughes’
opinions
in
sum,
are
expressed
in
dealing
with
advertising
which
related
to
health
said
that
the
legislature
was
entitled
to
conclude
that
advertising
could
be
limited
or
even
abolished
in
the
public
interest.
and
the
court
said,
“we
see
no
constitutional
reason
why
a
state
may
not
treat
all
who
deal
with
the
human
eye
as
members
of
a
profession
who
should
use
no
merchandising
methods
for
obtaining
customers”.
we
submit
that
it
is
plain
false
logic
for
the
other
side
to
say
that
the
hughes
opinion
or
the
cardozo
opinion
that
preceded
it
or
the
douglas
opinion
that
followed
it
somehow
are
all
immaterial,
because
they
did
not
use
the
precise
words
“free
speech”.
mr.
john
p.
frank
mr.
justice
white,
you
have,
in
effect,
raised
the
question
of
a
series
of
cases
which
have
come
up
here
which
have
upheld
group
legal
services
and
permitted
effective
advertising
communication
through
them;
and
the
answer
is
that
that
would
not
be
a
violation
in
the
state
of
arizona,
either.
this
talk
that
you
have
been
given
today
suggests
that
somehow
arizona
blacks
out
all
kinds
of
communication.
the
fact
is
that
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court,
the
one
under
discussion
about
newspaper
advertising,
is
a
particular
rule.
there
are
others,
and
there
is
an
express
rule.
and
our
state
has
been
one
of
the
very
first
ones
to
permit
institutional
advertising
for
legal
services
and
institutional
advertising
for
groups.
mr.
john
p.
frank
what
i
am
saying,
your
honor,
i
am
being
brief
because
of
the
exigency
of
time;
but
if
you
will
look
at
our
rule
2-101,
subparagraph
7,
you
will
find
---
i
hold
it
in
my
hand
--
that
that
kind
of
thing
would
be
allowed.
what
our
state
sees
fit
to
bar
is
advertising
by
individual
lawyers
in
newspapers
for
the
purpose
of
lining
their
own
pockets.
it
expressly
permits
institutional
advertising
and
benefit
of
lawyer
referral
services;
it
permits
advertising
for
legal-aid
organizations;
and
it
would
permit
certainly
the
union
to
tell
its
people
what
the
services
are
which
are
part
of
the
program.
these
are
matters
of
very
subtle
distinction,
which
our
supreme
court
has
seen
fit
to
make;
but
our
supreme
court
has
not
seen
fit
to
allow
this
kind
of
advertising
of
the
individual
pocket-lining
variety.
mr.
john
p.
frank
i
am
in
doubt.
frankly,
i
would
want
to
give
it
tighter
thought
than
i
have.
mr.
john
p.
frank
i
do
think
that
it
is
permitted,
at
least
under
the
rules
which
we
have.
mr.
john
p.
frank
i
am
in
doubt
as
to
whether
there
is
constitutional
protection.
i
simply,
as
i
say,
have
not
thought
it
through
to
my
satisfaction.
but
that
is
because
i
approach
it
from
a
different
standpoint.
i
approach
it
in
terms
of
who
is
to
make
these
decisions,
a
matter
to
which
i
will
come.
and
the
contending
circumstance
here
is
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
has
determined
to
do
precisely
that.
now,
we
know
that
there
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
as
i
say,
in
respect
to
the
ads
which
are
the
ads
for
the
group
services,
whereas,
for
example,
the
union
wishes
to
tell
its
members
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
yes,
and
the
answer
is
that,
for
example,
you
have
one
of
the
briefs
before
you
is
the
brief
of
the
arizona
credit
union
league,
and
what
the
arizona
credit
union
league
says
expressly
is,
“we
don't
want
to
be
associated
with
the
argument
that
mr.
canby
is
making”.
what
they
say
is,
"it
is
enough
that
we
are
entitled
to
tell
our
own
members
in
some
effective
way
about
the
services
which
are
available
to
our
own
members".
and
that
under
the
cases,
i
submit,
is
permitted
and
is
acceptable.
where
we
are
drawing
a
line
for
a
lot
of
reasons,
which
go
to
the
nature
of
professionalism,
to
which
i
come
and
which
we
reach
with
determination,
is
that
there
is
less
onslaught
and
destruction
of
the
profession
by
allowing
groups
of
that
sort
to
communicate
with
their
members
about
services
available
than
there
is
about
the
kind
of
thing
the
chief
justice
talked
about,
having
a
lawyer
saying
“i
will
give
it
to
you
for
$19.95
on
a
hot
saturday
afternoon”.
mr.
john
p.
frank
all
we
permit
the
credit
union
to
do
is,
first,
to
arrange
for
legal
services
and,
second,
to
tell
people
that
they
are
there.
i
want
to
make
clear
that
we
are
no
more
regressive
than
our
friends
about
the
problem
raised
by
justice
powell.
of
course
we
have
to
do
the
best
we
can
to
extend
legal
services
in
the
united
states;
and
we
have
to
do
a
better
job
than
we
are
doing
and
we
are
trying,
and
that
is
one
of
the
ways
we
try.
but
the
bludgeon
of
the
first
amendment,
the
main
point
of
the
colloquy
this
morning
with
justice
stewart,
it
is
simply
not
a
suitable
tool
or
device
for
doing
it.
let
me
turn,
if
i
may,
to
the
concept
of
commercial
speech
as
being
balanced
against
the
community
values
of
the
control
of
that
speech.
my
own
syllogism,
unlike
the
other
side's,
is,
the
legal
profession
is
worth
preserving.
its
good
vastly
outweighs
its
evils;
the
minor
premise
is
that
commercialization
is
incompatible
with
professionalism;
and
the
conclusion
is,
therefore,
the
profession
should
avoid
commercialization.
now,
i
know
i
have
to
defend
that
syllogism
against
hard
attack.
we
all
know
that
law
offices
are
big
businesses,
that
they
may
have
billion-dollar
or
million-dollar
clients,
they
are
run
with
computers
and
all
the
rest.
and
so
the
argument
may
be
made
that
to
term
them
“noncommercial”
is
sanctimonious
humbug.
but
my
response,
developed
more
fully
in
my
brief
than
i
can
here,
is
very
much
the
response
that
plato
made
to
the
same
argument
2,000
years
ago.
plato,
in
his
dialogue
with
thrasymachus
in
the
republic,
makes
two
points
which
have
some
real
bearing
here.
his
first
point
is
that
because
of
the
degree
of
special
knowledge
involved,
the
professional
on
the
one
hand
and
his
client
on
the
other
are,
as
he
saw
it,
“almost
like
the
ruler
and
his
subject”
were
the
fancy
words
he
used.
in
everyday
terms,
this
means
that
the
professional
diagnosis,
the
problem,
and
he
makes
his
recommendations.
while
the
client
has
some
choice
of
rejection
or
selection
of
alternative
courses
of
action,
he
is
basically
dependent
on
the
advice
he
receives.
in
short,
plato
saw
a
profound
difference
between
buying
a
pot
and
obtaining
a
remedy
for
a
disease,
just
as
there
is
a
profound
difference
between
going
to
the
drugstore
and
getting
a
bottle
of
standard-produced
pills
and
going
to
the
doctor
and
finding
out
what
one
ought
to
do
for
his
illness.
now,
this,
we
developed
again
extensively
in
the
brief
before
you,
is
developed
by
the
sociologists
as
a
recognition
that
this
condition
still
exists,
and
it
puts
very
serious
problems
of
social
control.
the
plain
truth
is
that
laymen
cannot
judge
a
professional
performance
in
many
cases.
indeed,
they
may
not
even
be
able
to
set
the
goals
for
the
professional’s
work,
and
this
means
that
the
two
most
common
forms
of
control
of
work
in
industrial
societies,
either
bureaucratic
supervision
or
customer
judgment,
are
of
only
limited
applicability
to
the
professions.
at
the
same
time
there
is
a
need
for
social
control,
and
so
we
come
to
the
ultimate
question:
who
is
going
to
exercise
it?
our
adversaries
wish
it
to
be
exercised
by
the
policemen
or
a
legal
equivalent
of
the
food
and
drug
administration.
we
want
it
exercised
by
the
courts,
taking
such
help
as
they
need
from
the
professions.
now,
plato
makes
another
point
which
is
serious
here.
i
go
into
this
because
if
we
are
talking
about
professionalism
and
what
this
is
going
to
do
to
the
profession,
then
we
need
to
know
what
a
profession
is
and
what
this
one
is.
plato
says,
“is
the
physician
a
healer
of
the
sick
or
a
maker
of
money?”
and
his
answer
is
that
no
true
professional
considers
his
own
good
in
what
he
describes,
but
rather
the
good
of
his
patient,
because
the
true
professional
is
not
a
mere
moneymaker.
and
this
leads
to
the
related
concept
of
the
professional
and
service,
and
that
has
lived
with
us
for
2,000
years.
roscoe
pound
was
no
high
priest
of
sanctimony,
and
he
gave
us
a
firm
reminder
of
the
professional
who
performs
service
for
little
or
nothing.
he
says,
“the
spirit
of
public
service
in
which
the
profession
of
law
is
or
ought
to
be
exercised
is
the
prerequisite
of
sound
administration
of
justice
according
to
law".
this,
i
submit,
is
a
key
difference
between
commercialization
and
professionalism.
mr.
john
p.
frank
that
is
right.
mr.
john
p.
frank
the
first
thing
that
he
would
do,
mr.
justice
marshall,
is
go
to
the
legal
aid
society.
and
i
am
able
to
testify
to
that,
because
i
personally
have
served
there
for
a
long
time
and
so
has
my
office.
and
he
would
come
in
there,
and
he
would
very
possibly
get
his
divorce
for
nothing.
but
if
because
of
breakdown,
if
because
it
does
not
move
fast
enough
to
satisfy
him
and
he
wants
it
right
now,
he
will
call
the
lawyer-referral
service.
we
have
in
the
room
today
somebody
from
the
aba’s
lawyer-referral
service,
which
is
doing
the
best
it
can
to
get
names
distributed.
mr.
john
p.
frank
he
will
find
the
lawyer
referral
service,
because
the
bar
is
able
to
advertise
that
this
institution
exists.
mr.
john
p.
frank
it
can
advertise
it
in
a
newspaper
or
on
the
radio
or
in
any
way
it
wishes.
mr.
john
p.
frank
it
is
done,
and
there
are
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
yes.
i
cannot
tell
you
as
to
the
frequency
of
the
pace.
i
can
vouch
for
the
fact
that
serious
efforts
are
made
by
the
bar
to
get
the
word
out.
mr.
john
p.
frank
yeah,
if
it
does
not
get
to
this
man,
then
he
may
have
to
do
what
people
have
traditionally
done.
and
let
me
say,
it
is
not
much
of
a
problem.
our
town
is
50%
over
the
national
advertisers
in
divorces,
and
people
are
not
having
any
trouble
finding
someone
to
get
them
for
them,
not
any.
it
is
just
a
zero
problem
in
our
community.
if
anything,
we
may
have
too
many;
they
may
be
finding
them
too
easily,
but
they
are
there.
mr.
john
p.
frank
these
people
think
they
are
making
money.
i
quoted
--
pardon
me.
mr.
john
p.
frank
they
may
or
may
not;
it
depends,
obviously,
on
how
many
do
it.
but
they
make
money,
as
one
of
them
said,
and
i
quoted
him
before:
“it's
not
my
job
to
inform
a
prospective
client
that
he
needn't
employ
a
lawyer
to
handle
his
work”.
to
the
true
professional
and
to
most
of
the
lawyers
in
this
room,
that
is
shocking;
it
is
turning
a
law
office
into
a
butcher
shop.
mr.
john
p.
frank
i
am
satisfied,
however,
that
those
who
sought
to
be
conscientious,
as
you
were
when
you
were
in
practice
and,
i
must
say,
i
and
mr.
louis
as
practitioners,
do
not
sell
people
services
that
they
do
not
need,
and
we're
mighty
scrupulous
and
invariable
about
it.
and
i
hope
true
professionals
are,
and
i
hope
that
is
part
of
the
meaning
of
professionalism.
i
pass
over
a
little
of
the
talk
of
what
the
profession
is
and
what
we
are
trying
to
do
with
it,
simply
as
a
matter
of
time
economy;
but
i
want
to
drive
this
home:
that
part
of
the
business
of
being
a
professional
is,
and
we
acknowledge
it,
a
kind
of
a
status.
part
of
the
privilege
of
that
status
of
being
a
lawyer
and
an
officer
of
the
court
is
a
meaningful
set
of
duties
which
go
with
it.
we
are
talking
about
one
of
them.
more
than
100
years
ago,
the
english
jurist
a.v.
dicey
said,
"the
chief
difference
between
a
profession
and
a
trade
is
that
in
the
case
of
a
profession
its
member
sacrifice
a
certain
amount
of
individual
liberty
in
order
to
ensure
certain
professional
objects".
what
i
am
saying
is
that
being
a
professional
means
taking
your
place
in
a
whole
network
of
privileges
and
duties.
as
this
court
said
in
cohen
v.
hurley
--
it
was
overruled
later;
but
on
this
point,
this
quote,
the
majority
quoted
it
and
the
minority
adopted
it,
and
what
you
said
goes
to
those
duties:
"it
is
certainly
not
beyond
the
realm
of
permissible
state
concern
to
conclude
that
too
much
attention
to
the
business
of
getting
clients
may
be
incompatible
with
a
sufficient
devotion
to
the
duties
which
a
lawyer
has
to
the
court".
i
have
spoken
of
the
direct
damage
to
the
public,
the
kind
of
thing
chief
justice
traynor
was
talking
about,
in
letting
the
snake-oil
peddlers
loosen
the
legal
profession.
but
beyond
that,
there
is
the
injury
which
comes
to
the
profession
itself
and,
through
it,
to
the
public
which
i
submit
benefits
from
it.
first
of
all
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
yes,
your
honor.
and
let
me
go
to
that
this
moment
and
reorder
what
i
have
to
say
and
pick
that
up.
the
key
point
is,
one,
your
comment
goes
directly
to
justice
powell’s
first
question.
the
problem
is,
who
is
going
to
deal
with
this
situation?
the
fact
is
that
there
are
a
whole
variety
of
possible
solutions,
and
what
i
am
contending
is
that
it
ought
to
be
the
supreme
court
or
the
state
legislatures
that
can
determine
in
the
particular
state
what
is
best
to
do.
there
is
a
whole
variety
of
proposals
in
the
country.
there
is
the
california
proposal;
there
is
the
district
of
columbia
proposal;
there
is
what
michigan
adopted
today.
there
is
movement
on
the
way
to
try
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
legal
services.
and
what
we
face
in
this
case
is
another
example
of
a
wise
observation
attributed
to
mr.
justice
burns
when
he
was
a
senator
at
the
time
of
the
court
plan
and
after
there
had
been
a
resignation
and
a
replacement,
he
went
to
mr.
roosevelt,
runs
the
legend
and
says,
“why
run
for
a
train
after
you've
caught
it?”
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
all
over
the
country,
there
is
movement;
there
is
in
my
state.
and
these
are
matters
which
are
commonly
and
traditionally
entrusted
to
the
state
bars
and
the
state
courts
to
solve.
they
do
not
lend
to
legislation.
the
plain
truth
is
that
to
deal
with
all
those
refinements
--
you
asked
the
other
side
about
it,
the
question
of
this
kind,
that
kind
and
the
other
kind
--
you
cannot
do
that
by
constitutional
mandate.
those
things
take
the
kinds
of
regulation
that
the
ftc
has,
pages
of
them
--
"this
will
permitted,
that
will
that”
--
to
make
the
selectivity
which
may
be
required.
the
michigan
example
is
one;
the
aba
proposal
is
another.
the
ultimate
issue
which
is
before
you
is,
are
you
going
to
seek
to
solve
this
problem
by
the
constitutional
bludgeon,
or
are
you
gong
to
permit
fine,
close
work
to
be
done
in
the
states
where
there
is
responsibility,
too,
in
dealing
with
these
problems
of
extending
legal
services?
mr.
john
p.
frank
you
said
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
better
than
i,
and
it
is
exactly
what
i
want
to
say:
they
are
entitled
to
do
it.
mr.
john
p.
frank
it
is;
but
you
will
notice
that
all
of
these
proposals
are
very
sharply
limited
to
date.
now,
with
the
experimentation,
it
may
go
further;
but
what
we
are
really
pleading
for
is,
in
the
desire
to
solve
this
problem,
let
us
not
destroy
the
substance
of
the
shared
professionalism
which
we
have
built
up;
and
i
do
not
apologize
for
being
classical
on
this
score,
mr.
justice
marshall,
because
we
are
dealing
with
a
professional
tradition
of
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
years.
mr.
john
p.
frank
well,
i
am
delighted
to
report
to
you
that
at
least
the
incomes
have
gone
up;
and
some
of
the
offices
are
bigger,
some
are
not.
i
would
like
to
if
i
may,
because
i
speak
here
for
the
profession.
mr.
john
p.
frank
frequently,
sir,
for
nothing
and
frequently
took
$10
cases;
but
abraham
lincoln
never
made
but
one
ad
in
his
life,
and
that
was
to
put
an
announcement
in
the
paper
when
he
returned
from
congress
to
say
that
his
office
was
open.
mr.
john
p.
frank
it
is
a
different
day
and
age;
but
it
is
an
age
in
which
professional
tradition
has
a
contribution
still
to
make.
let
me,
if
i
may,
conclude
on
a
note
of
unabashed
sentiment.
i
will
not
refer
to
the
antitrust
subject,
merely
because
it
is
fully
briefed.
i
sit
here
with
my
partner,
louis.
he
has
just
celebrated
his
74th
birthday.
his
father,
with
whom
he
once
practiced,
was
a
territorial
judge
in
our
state,
and
the
roots
of
his
practice
extended
back
to
the
19th
century.
my
own
father
died
40
years
ago.
he
or
i
have
been
members
of
the
bar
of
wisconsin
almost
for
all
of
this
century,
my
native
state.
we
have
with
us
today
a
young
lady
who
assists
us
as
the
new
breed
of
legal
assistant.
because
of
her
age,
she
probably
will
be
linked
with
the
law
until
the
millennium.
the
point
is
that
just
in
this
one
case
on
this
one
side,
the
professional
ties
represent
100
consecutive
years
in
the
law.
we
know
the
weaknesses
of
this
profession,
its
limitations
and
its
failures.
so,
obviously,
do
the
members
of
this
court.
we
also,
all
of
us,
the
few
at
this
table,
this
court,
the
lawyers
in
this
room,
the
thousands
outside,
and
those
who
came
before
us,
have
taken
pride
in
being
associated
with
what
is
good
about
this
profession;
pride
in
being
associated
with
it.
minor
figures
we
as
individuals
may
be,
but
our
line
runs
to
cicero
and
to
marshall
and
to
hughes,
and
we,
too,
hope
that
we
serve
in
our
small
ways.
may
it
never
be
said
that
this
profession
was
cheapened
here
in
this,
its
highest
sanctuary.
thank
you
very
much.
