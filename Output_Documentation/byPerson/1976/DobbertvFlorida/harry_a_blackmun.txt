harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
frost
before
you
sit
down,
what
do
you
think
is
the
purpose
of
the
ex
post
facto
provision?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
first
of
all
it
does
not
apply
i
take
it
to
judicial
decisions
as
distinguished
in
the
legislative
acts?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
know
of
any
case
where
they
have
ever...
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
which
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
do
not
feel
that
profitt
in
effect
there
is
a
hold
in
here
or
that
the
florida
procedure
before
was
much
more
rigorous
than
now
which
would
eliminate
your
ex
post
facto
argument?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
you
know
the
profitt
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you
think
that
your
client
is
better
or
worse
off
now
that
profitt
has
been
decided?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
take
the
position
at
any
procedural
change
results
in
the
ex
post
facto
consideration,
any?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
see
your
comment
gets
back
again
to
mr.
justice
rehnquistâ€™s
early
question
whether
at
the
time
this
crime
was
committed
under
florida
law,
he
was
not
subject
to
death.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
only
answer
you
can
give
is
well
the
proffitt
case
came
along.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
it
was
not
the
law
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
is
it
not
a
bit
of
speculation
as
to
what
the
jury
would
have
done?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
under
a
different
statute?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
under
a
different
statute?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
those
that
this
court
vacated
the
death
sentence,
they
would
be
vacated,
but
the
other
guy
that
was
convicted
under
the
same
circumstances.
the
florida
courts
could
re-impose
the
death
sentence.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
got
anything
to
back
that
up?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
oh,
if
anything
other
than
florida
supreme
court?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
this
your
only
answer
to
that
point?
your
only
answer
being
that
looked
at
as
a
whole
statute
is
more
favorable?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
is
the
other
part?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
is
quite
the
test,
is
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
under
lindsey?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
know
but
under
the
old
statute
here,
if
the
jury
recommended
mercy,
the
judge
had
no
alternative?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
he
had
to
accept
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
here
the
same
recommendation,
he
does
not
have
to
accept?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
understand
that
but
again
is
that
your
only
answer?
