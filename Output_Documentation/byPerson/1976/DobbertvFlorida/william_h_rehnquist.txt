justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
would
have
been
punishable
under
that
previous
florida
statute
though
by
death,
would
he
not
have?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
according
to
the
terms
of
the
florida
law,
he
would
have
been,
would
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
said
punishable
not
punished.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
florida
law
apart
from
my
decision
in
furman
authorize
punishment
by
death
for
the
offense
of
which
he
was
found
guilty?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
question
mr.
frost
was
apart
from
my
decision
in
furman,
if
you
simply
read
the
statute
that
florida
had
on
the
books
at
that
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
claim
then
is
not
he
could
not
have
been
punishable
by
death
previous
to
the
enactment
of
the
new
florida
statute,
but
that
there
was
enough
difference
in
the
factors
to
be
considered?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
is
your
second?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
the
old
law,
was
the
judge
bound
by
the
juryâ€™s
verdict
in
either
event
or
if
the
jury
did
not
recommend
mercy,
could
the
judge
nonetheless
impose
something
less
than
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
did
that
not
happen
and
his
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
would
you
not
think
that
that
lindsey
v.
washington
was
limited
to
cases
where
the
death
penalty
was
actually
imposed
and
laid
down
procedural
guarantees
where
that
happened?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
did
different
parole
rights
in
his
particular
case,
did
he
not,
in
lindsay?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
making
an
argument
here
that
something
which
could
not
possibly
have
affected
your
client
in
view
of
the
sentence
of
death
is
something
which
he
is
nonetheless
free
to
challenge
on
an
ex
post
facto
basis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
are
going
to
hear
that
at
the
trial
anyway,
are
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
you
say
if
they
had
increased
the
penalty
from
a
minimum
of
10
years
to
a
minimum
of
50
years?
would
you
say
the
ex
post
facto
clause
would
bar
the
application
greater?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
florida
supreme
court
did
not
consider
the
issue
before
us
here
now,
did
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
no
discussion
of
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
a
subject
to
the
motion
for
rehearing,
was
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
was
denied
without
discussion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
petition
in
this
case
was
convicted
of
murdering
and
torturing
his
children
and
was
sentenced
to
death
by
a
florida
trial
court
sitting
in
jacksonville.
the
supreme
court
of
florida
affirmed
his
conviction
and
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
his
constitutional
attacks
on
the
judgment.
we
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
at
the
time
the
murder
has
occurred,
the
florida
death
sentencing
statute
provided
at
the
jury
was
to
determine
whether
the
sentence
was
to
be
life
or
death.
subsequent
to
this
court's
decision
in
furman
versus
georgi,
but
prior
to
petitioner's
trial,
the
florida
court's
found
that
this
procedure
was
unconstitutional.
the
florida
legislature
enacted
a
new
procedure
whereby
the
jury
made
a
recommendation
as
to
life
or
death
but
the
final
determination
was
placed
in
the
hands
of
a
trial
judge
subject
to
automatic
review
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
petitioner
was
tried
under
this
statute
and
the
jury
in
his
case
recommended
by
attend
of
two-vote
that
he
would
be
subject
only
to
life
imprisonment.
the
judge
set
aside
this
recommendation
made
the
findings
required
by
the
florida
statute
and
imposed
the
sentence
of
death.
petitioner
contends
here
that
the
death
sentence
had
imposed
upon
and
violates
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
the
united
states
constitution,
both
because
of
the
change
in
the
role
of
the
judge
and
the
jury
and
because
the
florida
statute
imposing
the
death
sentence
for
the
crime
of
which
he
convicted
was
later
held
unconstitutional.
we
reject
these
contentions.
petitioner
was
on
notice
from
the
earlier
florida
death
--
death
penalty
statute
that
criminal
conducts
such
as
that
of
which
he
was
found
guilty
was
punishable
by
death.
the
change
in
the
allocation
of
function
between
the
judge
and
the
jury
and
the
imposition
of
the
death
sentence
was
procedural
in
nature
and
did
not
work
to
the
overall
detriment
of
petitioner
since
it
provide
him
with
greater
rather
than
less
procedural
protection.
this
is
true
even
though
in
petition
is
particular
case
the
fact
that
the
majority
of
the
jury
recommended
life
imprisonment
would
under
the
old
statute
have
prevented
the
imposition
of
the
death
sentence
upon
it.
petitioner
has
also
claimed
that
this
change
in
law
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
and
that
he
was
denied
his
constitutional
right
to
a
fair
trial
by
the
refusal
to
grant
his
motion
for
a
change
of
venue.
for
reasons
more
fully
stated
in
the
opinion,
we
reject
these
contentions
also.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
stevens
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall
joined.
