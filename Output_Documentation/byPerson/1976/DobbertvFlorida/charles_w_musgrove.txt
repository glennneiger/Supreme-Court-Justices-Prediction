mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
charles
musgrove
with
the
office
of
the
florida
attorney
general
in
tallahassee.
i
represent
the
respondent,
the
state
of
florida.
briefly,
it
is
our
position
that
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
as
to
the
ex
post
facto
nature
of
the
sentencing
procedure
is
without
merit
because
this
is
nothing
but
a
procedural
matter.
we
think
the
essence
of
the
ex
post
facto
provision
is
noticed.
we
think
that
was
the
gist
of
this
court’s
decision
in
bouie.
more
recently,
mr.
justice
stevens
wrote
a
case
regarding
the
application
of
memoirs
test
in
pornography
matters
in
which
you
confirmed
again
that
the
essence
of
the
ex
post
facto
law
is
noticed
and
there
is
no
notice
problem
in
this
case.
if
mr.
dobbert
were
a
student
of
the
law,
he
would
have
known
at
the
time
he
committed
this
offense
he
was
indeed
subject
to
the
death
penalty.
at
the
time
he
stood
trial,
he
was
indeed
subject
to
the
death
penalty.
in
fact
there
was
no
change
whatever
in
the
punishment
to
which
he
was
subjected.
at
the
time
of
the
offense,
the
punishment
was
either
life
imprisonment
or
death.
at
the
time
he
stood
trial,
the
punishment
was
either
life
imprisonment
or
death.
now,
there
was
an
additional
provision
in
the
new
florida
law
which
mr.
frost
has
referred
to
this
morning,
which
provides
for
no
parole
for
a
period
of
25
years
upon
a
conviction
for
a
capital
felony.
florida
has
conclusively
construed
that
provision
not
to
a
part
to
any
case
such
as
petitioner’s
where
the
offense
occurred
prior
to
the
affective
date
of
the
statute.
so,
it
is
not
simply
a
matter
that
because
petitioner
received
the
death
penalty
and
not
life
imprisonment,
he
did
not
get
the
25
years
without
parole.
it
is
a
fact
that
he
could
not
have
gotten
it.
it
is
the
lee
decision
which
we
have
heard
a
lot
about
already
today
and
you
will
hear
some
more
for
me
and
i
am
sure
again
from
mr.
frost,
lee
decides
that
question.
so
we
contend
that
there
is
simply
no
change
in
the
punishment
to
which
petitioner
was
subjected
that
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
lindsey
case
which
was
brought
up
i
believe
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
lindsey
involved
a
case
in
which
would
have
been
a
maximum
punishment,
15
years
suddenly
became
a
mandatory
punishment.
the
judge
was
required
to
impose
the
15
years
and
the
time
that
the
person
would
then
get
out
of
prison
was
to
be
at
the
discretion
of
the
parole
authorities.
that
is
not
the
case
we
have
here
because
there
has
been
no
change
whatever
in
the
punishment
imposable.
you
have
heard
this
morning
that
it
is
a
freakish
thing
to
make
the
result
depend
upon
the
date
of
trial.
i
suggest
too
that
in
procedural
matters,
there
is
no
other
time
to
which
a
procedure
can
relate
except
the
date
of
trial.
the
date
when
the
procedure
is
to
be
applied
and
certainly
no
procedure
can
apply
before
its
effective
date
and
if
this
court
wishes
to
assume
that
it
is
freakish
to
make
the
outcome
of
a
case
depend
upon
the
date
of
trial
then
i
would
ask
this
court
what
it
was
deciding
when
it
decided
johnson
v.
new
jersey,
which
applied
as
this
court
will
recall
the
dictates
of
the
miranda
decision
only
to
those
cases
which
went
to
trial
after
the
effective
date
of
the
miranda
decision.
i
realize
this
court
has
not
applied
that
test
since
that
time.
however,
i
would
suggest
that
to
tell
the
state
of
florida
that
it
cannot
do
the
same
thing
this
court
did
in
johnson
v.
new
jersey
that
for
florida
to
do
it
would
be
freakish,
would
be
inconsistent
on
the
part
of
this
court.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
i
would
take
the
position,
--
yes
sir
that
florida
could
have
than
so,
however
as
a
practical
matter
florida
did
not
do
so
to
all
those
people
who
were
on
death
row
at
that
time,
florida
vacated
the
death
sentences
and
imposed
life
imprisonment
instead.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
cannot
tell
you
what
was
in
the
minds
of
the
justices
of
the
florida
supreme
court.
they
indicated
on
one
hand
that
they
did
not
think
there
was
any
way
to
save
their
capital
statute.
however,
they
were
faced
at
that
very
time
with
a
brand
new
procedure.
i
have
taken
the
position
in
the
brief
for
the
respondent
that
they
could
in
fact
have
save
it
in
a
variety
of
ways.
they
could
have
simply
adapted
the
same
procedures
that
ultimately
were
adapted
in
the
statute.
however,
they
were
already
faced
with
a
brand
new
statute
which
would
supersede
anything
they
could
do
and
they
did
indeed
go
ahead
and
wipe
out
all
then
existing
death
penalties
which
we
suggest
is
precisely
what
this
court
said
had
to
happen
as
a
result
of
furman,
namely
that
all
existing
death
penalties
had
been
unconstitutionally
imposed
and
could
not
stand.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
that
is
our
position,
yes
sir
and
in
fact
that
is
precise
with
the
wisdom
with
rudolf
allenton
lee
and
rudolf
allenton
lee
not
only
received
the
death
sentence,
but
his
death
sentence
was
affirmed.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
that
is
our
position,
if
it
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
the
florida
supreme
court
thought
it
could
do
so
and
root
off...
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
no
sir.
i
think
this
is
a
really
unique
case.
i
do
not
think
either
side
has
found
a
case
quite
like
it
anywhere.
i
suggest
that
whatever
decision
this
court
may
make
at
this
time,
it
would
be
plowing
new
ground.
now,
rudolf
allenton
lee
was
indeed
ultimately
reversed.
the
death
sentence
was
cast
out
by
the
florida
supreme
court
in
the
second
go
round
and
the
reason
it
did
so,
i
suggest
this
court
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
situation
mr.
dobbert
finds
himself
in.
it
is
simply
this.
mr.
lee
like
all
other
who
were
on
death
row
at
the
time
this
court
decided
furman
should
have
had
its
death
sentence
set
aside
by
either
the
florida
supreme
court
or
upon
remand.
i
think
actually
all
death
sentences
were
set
aside
by
the
florida
supreme
court
either
in
baker
or
an
anderson
v.
the
state.
now,
lee
did
not
simply
because
his
attorney
made
the
mistake
of
following
the
advice
of
the
attorney
general
of
florida
and
rushing
right
back
to
the
trial
judge
to
get
his
sentence
set
aside
at
which
point
the
state
took
an
appeal.
the
appeal
was
ultimately
decided
after
the
effective
date
of
the
new
statute
and
lee
thus
became
the
only
person
who
had
been
on
death
row
prior
to
the
furman
decision
whose
sentence
to
death
was
not
forever
set
aside.
the
only
one,
not
only
that,
but
it
can
be
said
that
his
mistake
was
in
relying
on
representations
by
the
state.
all
the
supreme
court
of
florida
decided
in
lee
was
that
it
would
be
fundamentally
unfair
to
mr.
lee
to
penalize
him
for
what
a
competent
attorney
choose
to
do
as
a
matter
of
tactics
which
produced
a
result
that
he
and
he
alone
of
all
those
people
was
still
subject
to
the
death
penalty.
now,
the
state
certainly
did
not
mislead
mr.
dobbert
in
any
fashion
and
the
fact
that
he
did
not
stand
trial
by
the
way
until
after
the
new
procedure
took
effect
was
surely
not
the
state’s
fault.
the
state
for
example
did
not
hide
the
evidence
of
these
crimes
by
lying
to
the
authorities,
by
keeping
the
children
out
of
school
so
their
trustees
could
not
be
seen,
by
feigning
a
suicide
in,
fort
lauderdale
and
hiding
out
in
wisconsin,
new
orleans
in
texas
and
fighting
extradition
so
that
he
could
not
possibly
have
stood
trial
until
after
the
new
procedure
took
effect.
none
of
that
can
be
laid
at
defeat
of
the
state,
that
was
mr.
dobbert’s
doing
himself.
and
as
a
consequence
we
say
simply
this
is
a
procedural
matter.
it
did
not
order
the
punishment,
it
is
not
ex
post
facto.
i
feel
compelled
to
address
the
question
that
perhaps
has
already
been
resolved
in
the
minds
of
court
to
whether
the
new
statute
is
in
fact
harsher
or
beneficial
to
the
defendant
compared
to
the
old
one.
you
will
find
a
survey
in
the
state’s
brief
of
then
existing
cases.
subsequently,
i
have
updated
that,
some
seven
additional
cases
have
been
decided.
i
do
have
case
numbers
and
decision
dates
available,
but
of
those
seven
additional
cases
that
were
decided
by
the
florida
supreme
court,
three
of
those
have
been
affirmed,
the
death
sentences,
four
have
been
reversed
that
included
by
the
way
two
cases
in
which
the
jury
had
recommended
life
and
that
decision
was
overridden.
one
of
those
was
affirmed
and
the
other
was
reversed.
so,
at
this
point
of
a
total
of
40
cases
which
the
florida
supreme
court
has
decided
on
death
penalties,
22
of
those
had
been
affirmed,
18
of
those
have
been
reversed.
the
jury
recommendations
in
those
cases,
i
have
included
by
my
count
26
recommendations
to
death.
now,
in
addition
i
have
included
in
the
matters
attached
to
the
response
and
later
to
my
brief
some
four
cases
that
we
are
aware
of
and
there
may
well
be
others
because
we
do
not
routinely
get
those
in
our
tallahassee
office
and
the
issue
of
the
sentences
is
not
one
that
is
raised
on
appeal,
but
we
know
of
least
four
cases
in
which
the
process
went
the
other
way
and
in
which
the
jury
recommended
death
and
the
trial
judge
overrode.
so,
we
would
say
at
this
point
that
there
are
at
least
eight
and
now
counting
gardner
from
this
court
just
took
off
death
row,
nine
less
people
on
death
row
in
florida
there
would
have
been
under
the
old
procedure
in
which
the
jury
recommendation
was
binding.
we
think
that
is
very
strong
if
not
conclusive
evidence
that
the
new
procedure
is
favorable
to
the
defendant,
not
unfavorable
and
we
think
that
the
defendant
is
engaging
in
monday
morning
quarter
backing
when
he
says
well,
look
my
jury
recommendation
in
this
case
would
have
produced
a
life
sentence
for
me.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
that
is
part
of
the
answer,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
well,
first
of
all
we
think
he
is
merely
speculating,
he
cannot
say
what
sort
of
a
verdict
a
jury
would
have
returned
under
the
old
procedure.
the
jury
would
not
have
the
benefit.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
well,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
i
do
not
understand
lindsey
to
have
any
application
to
a
case
such
as
this
your
honor.
if
it
does,
it
eludes
me
because
lindsey
was
a
case
in
which
the
potential
punishment
clearly
went
from
maximum
of
15
years
imprisonment
to
a
mandatory
15
years
imprisonment.
there
was
not
longer
any
possibility
for
the
judge
to
give
any
less
than
15
years.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
that
is
true
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
that
is
true.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
and
under
the
old
system
your
honor,
if
the
jury
recommended
death,
the
judge
also
had
no...
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
no,
my
answer
still
is
that
what
he
just
doing
is
engaging
in
monday
morning
quarter
backing
and
saying
this
is
what
would
have
happened
under
the
old
procedure
and
i
suggest
again
that
is
speculation
on
his
part.
he
cannot
say
as
a
matter
fact
what
a
jury
would
have
done
under
the
old
procedure.
the
jury
would
not
have
had
the
benefit
of
instructions
by
the
judge
on
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances.
the
jury
would
not
have
had
the
benefit
of
a
separate
proceeding
in
which
aggravating
and
mitigating
evidence
was
offered.
now,
i
have
recognized
it
in
this
case,
very
little
was
offered.
certain
psychiatric
reports
and
the
defense
counsel
read
to
the
jury
from
mr.
nizer’s
book,
the
implosion
conspiracy.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
there
was
sir,
but
there
was
no
appellate
review
and
the
florida
supreme
court
had
no
alternative
to
simply
reduce
the
sentence.
if
the
supreme
court
thought
an
unjust
result
was
reached,
all
they
could
do
is
order
a
new
trial,
but
they
had
no
review
of
the
sentence
as
such,
a
feature
which
this
court
has
found
to
be
a
very
vital
one
in
the
present
statutory
set
up
and
one
which
has
produced,
in
fact,
what
we
contend
is
a
third
opportunity
under
the
procedure
for
a
defendant
to
get
life
imprisonment
rather
than
death
wherein
the
past,
he
had
only
one
chance.
the
jury
verdict
was
it.
if
the
jury
said
he
die
he
died.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
yes
sir,
that
is
true.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
in
this
case,
the
jury
recommended
mercy
however;
the
jury
was
also
told
that
its
decision
was
not
final.
it
was
told
that
this
were
the
aggravating
circumstances,
these
were
the
mitigating
circumstances,
you
are
to
weigh
all
of
these
and
reach
whatever
conclusion
you
deemed
appropriate.
none
of
that
would
have
happened
under
the
old
procedure
and
certainly,
there
would
have
been
no
reading
from
the
book,
the
implosion
conspiracy
to
that
jury
under
the
old
procedure.
that
just
would
never
have
happened,
of
those14
cases
by
the
way
in
which
the
jury
has
recommended
life
imprisonment
and
the
judge
has
overridden,
nine
of
those
14
have
been
reversed
on
appeal
in
the
florida
supreme
court,
only
five
were
allowed
to
stand,
one
of
which
of
course
is
before
you
now,
in
dobbert.
one
i
might
mention
was
overturned
by
the
very
trial
judge
who
imposed
it
in
the
first
place,
that
is
the
sawyer
case
which
judge
baker
took
it
upon
himself
to
throw
out
and
still
another
one
was
the
decision
in
gardner
which
this
court
just
last
week
threw
out.
so
by
and
large,
i
would
say
this,
when
the
jury
recommends
mercy
in
florida
under
the
current
procedure,
it
is
a
very
exceptional
case
in
which
an
override
occurs
and
is
upheld.
before
the
supreme
court
said
that
in
affect
in
tedder,
when
it
said
the
jury
recommendation
should
be
binding
in
all
cases
except
those
in
which
no
reasonable
man
could
disagree.
obviously,
they
were
not
talking
about
judges
and
that
since
the
judges
rarely
agree.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
that
all
reasonable
men
would
agree.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
no
sir,
gardner
preceded
tedder
preceded
your
honor.
however
the
tedder
standard
was
in
effect
at
the
time
that
dobbert
was
decided
and
in
fact
one
of
the
dissenting
opinions
addressed
about
it
expressly.
the
other
dissenting
opinion,
rather
basically
the
jury
instructions
and
referred
briefly
to
the
question
of
change
of
venue.
all
the
other
five
justices
of
the
florida
supreme
court
concurred
that
the
judgment
and
the
sentence
were
proper.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
it
was
presented
to
the
florida
supreme
court,
however,
i
would
suggest
that
the
florida
supreme
court
having
already
decided
lee
and
miller
,
both
of
which
were
cited
in
my
brief,
did
not
feel
compelled
to
again
address
the
same
issue.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
no
discussion,
no
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
yes
sir.
however,
in
light
of
miller
and
lee,
recent
decisions
of
the
florida
supreme
court,
i
do
not
know
why
they
would
continue
to
plow
the
same
ground
when
they
had
other
issues
to
address.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
when
it
was
presented,
i
am
sure
it
was
not
just
ignored
entirely.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
yes
sir,
well,
it
would
have
been
dispositive
of
the
sentence.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
yes
sir,
it
simply
was
not
addressed.
now,
i
have
heard
some
discussion
here
today
about
the
savings
clause
and
if
i
understood
mr.
justice
burger’s
question
correctly,
it
went
to
whether
this
was
a
federal
question
at
all.
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
not.
however,
i
would
also
disagree
with
the
petitioner
as
to
the
effect
of
the
savings
clause,
florida
has
held
that
it
does
not
apply
to
procedural
matters.
here
again,
this
matter
was
certainly
presented
that
was
not
addressed,
but
again
had
to
have
been
decided
as
mr.
justice
white
has
just
pointed
out
and
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
basis
for
this
court
to
go
behind
what
the
florida
supreme
court
has
done.
again,
i
do
not
understand
that
this
should
be
considered
a
federal
question.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
on
the
question
of
the
ex
post
facto
application,
i
will
address
briefly
the
question
of
the
request
of
change
of
venue.
i
think
murphy
is
the
case
in
which
this
court
has
most
recently
addressed
this
subject.
i
think
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
murphy
also
and
i
think
in
every
aspect
save
one
in
which
it
is
distinguishable
and
it
is
distinguishable
in
favor
of
the
state.
here,
unlike
murphy
there
were
some
very
excellent
efforts
made
by
the
trial
judge
to
control
the
extent
and
duration
and
the
effect
of
what
i
would
concede
was
indeed
some
fair
amount
of
publicity.
here,
the
trial
judge
imposed
an
order
couple
of
months
before
the
trial
limiting
statements
by
court
personnel.
here,
he
sequestered
the
jury
throughout
the
trial
and
he
even
kept
them
separated
in
the
jury
selection.
initially,
jurors
were
selected.
in
fact,
the
first
27
perspective
jurors
were
brought
before
the
court
one
at
a
time.
this
proved
to
be
taking
too
long
so
thereafter
nine
were
brought
in
three
at
a
time.
thereafter
in
varying
numbers
of
either
six
or
five
at
a
time
until
jury
was
finally
selected
and
tentative
jurors
were
kept
separate.
perspective
jurors
were
kept
separate
from
those
being
questioned
and
those
which
were
tentatively
accepted
were
kept
still
in
another
location.
so,
that
even
if
one
of
the
jurors
would
have
say,
oh
i
have
read
everything,
one
of
the
perspective
jurors
would
have
say,
i
have
read
everything
and
i
am
just
convinced
this
man
is
an
animal,
he
is
guilty
as
charged,
he
deserves
to
die,
nobody
accept
those
jurors
being
questioned
right
then
and
initially
as
i
said
they
were
one
at
a
time
would
have
even
heard
this
outburst.
so
the
trial
judge
took
some
very
excellent
measures
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
this
trial.
such
measures,
this
court
thought
in
shepherd
would
have
been
sufficient
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
that
trial,
a
trial
which
this
court
will
recall
was
considered
to
have
been
conducted
in
a
circus
like
atmosphere.
certainly,
nothing
like
that
happens
here.
secondly,
we
have
suggested
that
there
is
noting
that
was
in
that
pre-trial
publicity
that
the
jury
did
not
hear
again
at
the
trial,
it
was
basically
straight
factual
reporting.
in
fact,
everything
was
there
again
for
they
jury
to
hear.
we
have
examined
the
voir
dire
examination
itself
and
discovered
that
unlike
murphy
where
everybody
had
heard
of
murphy,
a
substantial
number
of
perspective
jurors
had
not
heard
of
mr.
dobbert.
far
more
jurors
were
unable
to
set
aside
their
opinions
on
murphy
than
they
were
in
the
dobbert
case.
and
like
murphy,
they
were
even
some
in
dobbert
who
thought
that
perhaps
he
was
innocent
based
on
the
fact
that
they
could
not
find
the
bodies.
every
step
of
the
way
the
voir
dire
examination
here
demonstrated
that
this
was
not
an
impossible
situation.
it
was
possible
to
get
a
fair
jury
and
then
we
examined
the
results
of
the
trial
to
see
if
this
premise
proves
to
be
correct
and
in
fact
it
does.
this
jury
deliberated
for
i
think
some
six
or
seven
hours,
it
has
to
have
three
witnesses
re-read
including
this
one.
it
considered
lesser
included
offenses
as
to
all
four
and
actually
returned
verdicts
on
two
of
those
lesser
included
offenses
and
then
by
the
way
as
we
all
know,
the
same
jury
went
out
and
deliberated
for
perhaps
half
an
hour
or
so
and
returned
the
recommendation
to
life
imprisonment
and
this
mr.
dobbert
suggest
was
unfair
jury
that
he
could
not
get
a
fair
jury
in
duval
county
of
florida.
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
death
cases
are
indeed
different
and
that
is
the
only
distinction
between
this
case
and
murphy.
this
is
a
death
case.
death
cases
are
different.
i
do
not
deny
that,
but
by
the
very
fact
that
death
cases
are
different,
they
are
the
types
of
cases
which
invariably
attract
great
attention
in
the
press
and
unless
this
court
is
prepared
to
say
that
every
capital
case
must
be
tried
on
a
change
of
venue
then
you
must
look
to
the
selection
of
the
jury
where
there
is
no
change
of
venue
to
see
if
there
is
prejudice
and
i
suggest
to
you,
you
will
find
not
only
no
evidence
of
prejudice,
but
not
even
a
basis
on
which
to
conclude
that
prejudice
had
to
be
there
despite
the
protestations
of
the
perspective
jurors.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
at
the
time,
it
was
slightly
over
half
a
million.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
well,
i
do
not
believe
that
have
consolidated
yet
then.
subsequently,
they
consolidated,
but
jacksonville
was
the
county
seen
i
believe
at
that
time.
and
as
one
of
larger
population
areas
in
florida,
dade
county
is
larger,
perhaps
the
fort
lauderdale
area
but
it
is
one
of
the
largest
areas
and
i
am
not
sure
where
this
case
could
have
been
tried
if
not
duval
county
with
the
fair
jury.
i
heard
about
the
case
in
west
palm
beach
which
is
far
to
the
south.
certainly,
fort
lauderdale
were
he
left
the
suicide
note
heard
quite
a
bit
about
it,
but
the
basic
fact
is
that
this
i
suggest
was
in
fact
a
fair
trial
jury,
very
fair
and
there
has
been
neither
a
showing
of
actual
prejudice
or
even
circumstances
in
which
this
court
did
in
irvin
v.
dowd.
protestations
of
the
perspective
jurors
could
set
aside
their
pre-ordained
opinions
could
not
be
believed.
it
is
just
not
that
type
of
case
at
all.
certainly,
there
was
nothing
like
murphy,
they
talked
about
prior
convictions
that
were
totally
unrelated
and
were
never
heart
about
a
trial.
everything
here
that
the
jurors
could
have
learned,
they
did
learn
again
at
trial.
so,
we
would
suggest
that
the...
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
it
is
the
same
basic
issue
mr.
justice
stevens
and
frankly
the
notice
is
still
there
which
is
essentially...
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
right,
now
as
far
as
the
significance
of
this
case,
whatever
you
all
decide
for
florida
will
not
have
any
great
significance.
there
are
some
people
still
subject
to
the
death
sentence,
if
you
decide
in
favor
of
the
state
here.
mr.
dobbert
is
one
and
mr.
miller
is
back
up
for
review
again
in
the
florida
supreme
court
so
he
is
another,
i
know
of
one
myself
which
will
yet
go
to
trial.
i
think
it
is
scheduled
now
in
may
and
i
am
sure
there
are
some
others
who
for
some
reasons
were
not
tried
yet,
perhaps
they
were
in
as
it
were
in
(inaudible),
held
him
(inaudible)
but
if
this
decision
is
to
have
any
effect
at
all
and
it
may
have
some
slight
deterrent
effect,
it
will
not
deter
anybody
in
florida
except
perhaps
dobbert
who
as
this
court
has
recognized
will
never
do
this
again
if
he
is
executed.
it
will
not
deter
anybody
in
florida
because
florida’s
procedure
is
now
deemed
valid.
but
in
other
states,
just
to
illustrate,
robbery
is
usually
a
planned
offense
and
one
of
the
things
that
robber
has
to
calculate
on
is
should
i
kill
my
witness
and
thus
perhaps
run
the
risk
of
a
death
penalty
if
there
is
one
in
my
state
or
should
i
let
the
victim
live
and
run
the
risk
that
he
will
put
me
in
jail
because
of
course
eye
witness
testimony
is
the
best
possible
evidence
and
the
kind
that
the
robber
most
wants
to
eliminate.
now,
he
may
in
his
planning
make
the
definite
decision
one
way
or
the
other
based
on
his
analysis
of
his
law,
if
it
has
not
been
before
this
court
yet.
but
if
this
court
decides
in
dobbert
that
even
if
the
procedure
is
no
good
right
then,
it
can
be
amended
and
the
amendment
correcting
the
procedure
will
be
valid
and
will
apply
even
to
older
offenses
then
there
is
a
deterrent
to
him.
he
may
live
the
victim
alive,
i
realize
it
is
perhaps
only
a
slight
deterrent,
but
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
if
any
innocent
victims
who
had
their
lives
spared
as
a
result
of
the
death
penalty,
it
has
served
a
very
useful
purpose.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
pardon
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
oh
no,
not
right
at
the
moment.
mr.
charles
w.
musgrove
we
hope,
we
will
be
allowed
to
when
this
court
is
through
reviewing
their
cases.
yes
sir.
right,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
summarize
briefly
by
saying
that
this
is
not
an
ex
post
facto
application
because
it
is
merely
procedural
and
that
the
argument
relating
to
the
change
of
venue
should
be
rejected
on
grounds
of
murphy
because
in
every
instance
this
case
is
more
favorable
for
the
state
than
was
murphy.
thank
you.
