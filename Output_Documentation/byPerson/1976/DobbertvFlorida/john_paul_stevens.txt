justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
musgrove
before
you
leave
that
point,
is
it
your
submission
that
if
the
trial
had
taken
place
promptly
after
the
offense
and
before
the
decision
in
furman,
and
if
then
there
had
been
an
appeal
to
this
court
and
this
court
have
vacated
the
death
sentence
in
those
circumstances
that
florida
could
constitutionally
have
re-imposed
the
death
sentence
pursuant
to
one
of
that
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
florida
did
that
as
a
matter
of
its
policy
decision
rather
than
feeling
was
under
any
constitutional
compulsion
to
do
so?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
your
view
with
the
law
is
correct,
i
take
it
wherever
there
was
a
death
sentence
set
aside
if
the
state
had
elected
to
adapt
a
new
statute
and
then
have
another
penalty
hearing
and
ending
up
in
a
death
sentence,
it
could
have
done
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
musgrove,
under
the
old
law,
was
there
an
absolute
right
of
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
musgrove,
may
i
ask
you
questions.
first,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
statistics
correctly.
if
i
understand
you
there
are
40
death
cases
where
the
trial
court
is
supposed
to
sentence
to
death
in
florida
since
under
the
new
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
i
correctly
understand
that
in
those
40,
14
of
those
were
cases
in
which
the
jury
had
recommended
mercy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
all
14
of
those
then
the
trial
judge
substituted
the
verdict
of
death
for
the
juryâ€™s
recommendation
of
mercy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see
and
the
second
question
i
had
is,
although
we
do
not
know
what
have
happened
under
a
different
stature
scheme
before,
at
least
it
is
true
as
it
not
that
under
the
prior
procedure,
the
jury
might
have
returned
a
verdict
of
mercy
and
if
it
had,
that
would
have
been
the
matter
on
the
sentence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
was
presented?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
if
it
was
decided
the
other
way,
it
would
have
been
dispositive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
you
must
conclude
that
the
issue
was
decided
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
population
of
duval
county?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
jacksonville
the
county
seat?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
musgrove,
may
i
go
back
to
the
ex
post
facto
point
for
just
a
moment.
do
i
correctly
understand
your
argument
to
apply
to
this
situation?
last
term
as
you
know,
the
court
vacated
death
sentences
in
north
carolina
and
louisiana.
could
the
legislatures
of
those
dates
today
decide
to
authorize
new
sentencing
procedures
for
all
those
individuals
whose
death
sentences
were
set
aside
have
re-hearings
and
give
the
courts
power
to
re-impose
those
death
sentences?
i
understand
your
argument,
they
could.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
are
no
basic
differences
because
of
the
peculiar
way
this
case
arose.
it
is
the
basic
same
constitutional
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
point
being
at
the
time
they
committed
the
offense,
they
are
on
notice
that
it
was
a
capital
offense?
