mr.
louis
o.
frost
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
begin
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
just
take
a
brief
moment
to
introduce
to
the
court
my
chief
deputy
who
is
here
with
me
today,
mr.
william
p.
white
iii
and
for
whose
help
i
am
deeply
indebted
in
preparing
and
presenting
this
case
to
the
court.
i
would
also
like
to
publicly
thank
your
very
competent
clerk,
mr.
rodec
(ph)
for
all
his
assistance.
my
name
is
louis
frost
and
i
am
the
public
defendant
of
fourth
judicial
circuit
of
florida
and
i
appear
here
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
earnest
john
dobbert,
jr.
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
the
issues
involved
which
we
have
to
deal
with
today
are
one,
whether
or
not
the
trial
court
in
applying
the
1972
death
penalty
provisions
of
the
florida
statute
to
this
defendant,
earnest
john
dobbert,
jr.
violated
the
constitution
of
provisions
of
the
united
states
constitution
prohibiting
ex
post
facto
laws.
it
also
to
this
defendant
when
it
is
applied
to
him
whether
or
not
it
violated
the
constitutional
provision
prohibiting
one
from
having
his
equal
protection
laws
violated
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
and
third,
whether
or
not
the
trial
court
erred
in
failing
to
grant
the
defendant
in
this
case
and
the
petition
herein
a
change
of
venue
in
the
circumstances
as
they
existed
in
the
duval
county,
florida.
i
think
to
place
the
case
in
better
perspective
before
the
court
i
briefly
summarize
some
of
the
facts.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
first
came
to
the
attention
of
the
law
enforcement
authorities
and
city
of
jacksonville
in
the
spring
of
1972
at
which
time
his
oldest
son,
earnest
john
dobbert
iii
was
found
wandering
around
a
motel
in
jacksonville
holiday
inn.
he
was
taken
in
protective
custody.
he
appeared
to
have
bruises
upon
his
back
in
his
hands
and
burns.
he
was
taken
before
a
circuit
judge
and
questioned
and
there
upon
began
to
reveal
a
story
of
child
torture
and
child
abuse
to
himself,
his
two
sisters,
a
brother
and
the
ultimate
combination
of
death
of
one
of
his
youngest
sisters
and
brother
by
the
petitioner,
his
father
herein.
immediately
thereafter,
a
warrant
was
issued
for
was
arrest
and
he
was
not
found.
shortly
thereafter,
his
younger
daughter
was
found
in
a
local
hospital
at
fort
lauderdale,
florida
with
a
note
pinned
to
her
clothing
asking
that
she
be
returned
to
a
mother
in
wisconsin.
at
that
time
almost
simultaneously
with
that,
the
petitioner’s
abandoned
automobile
was
found
near
the
inland
waterway
and
there
was
an
apparent
suicide
note
left
with
it
that
the
petitioner
committed
suicide.
the
petitioner
was
not
heard
of
until
then
the
spring
of
1973
when
he
was
apprehended
in
houston,
texas.
he
elected
to
exercise
his
right
to
fight
extradition
back
to
the
state
of
florida
which
he
did
and
which
culminated
finally
in
his
extradition
to
florida.
he
was
appointed
public
counsel
to
the
public
defendant’s
office,
the
judge
did
not
solve
and
our
office
was
appointed.
he
raised
at
pre-trial
and
during
trial
the
questions
presented
herein
which
was
denied
by
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
proceeded
to,
attempt
to
pick
a
jury
and
the
jury
was
finally
selected
after
4-1/2
days
of
order
and
the
defendant
was
tried,
convicted
of
one
count
of
murder
in
the
first-degree
of
one
of
his
children,
of
one
count
of
murder
in
the
second-degree
of
another
child,
a
one
count
of
child
torture
as
to
one
of
his
children
and
one
count
of
child
abuse,
a
lesser
include
offense
of
child
torture.
immediately
thereafter
on
the
question
of
punishment,
the
jury
who
had
sat
in
that
case
deliberated
under
the
statute
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
recommended
by
10
to
2
majority
that
the
petitioner
be
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
under
the
count
of
murder
in
the
first
degree.
the
court
subsequently
thereto
overruled
that
recommendation
of
mercy
and
imposed
a
death
penalty
as
to
the
petitioner.
now
from
that
judgment
and
sentence,
the
petition
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
supreme
court
of
florida
ruled
in
their
majority
opinion
that
the
trial
court
was
correct
and
it
did
not
violate
the
due
process
in
failing
to
change
venue,
citing
a
recent
decision
of
this
court
of
murphy
v.
florida,
however,
they
failed
to
touch
upon
the
question
of
equal
protection
and
ex
post
facto
as
raised
herein.
we
petition
this
court
for
certiorari
and
that
petition
was
herein
granted.
during
the
time
of
the
initial
finding
of
the
oldest
son,
earnest
john
dobbert
iii
in
jacksonville,
florida,
immediately
thereupon
the
news
media,
the
local
television,
radio,
and
newspaper
to
began
to
cover
every
gruesome
detail
and
incidents
surrounding
this
particular
case
and
they
did
so
right
up
until
the
taking
into
custody
of
the
youngest
daughter
of
the
petitioner
in
fort
lauderdale,
florida.
after
which
when
the
petitioner
was
not
found
the
press
subsided
until
his
apprehension
in
houston,
texas
and
from
the
time
he
was
apprehended
in
houston
and
to
the
time
he
was
tried,
convicted
and
sentenced
the
media
was
continual
and
covering
every
incident
involving
every
phase
of
this
entire
proceeding,
this
is
more
clearly
pointed
out
by
the
appendix
to
the
petition
annexed
hereto.
the
first
issue
that
this
court
must
consider
is
whether
or
not
by
applying
the
1972
death
penalty
provisions
of
the
florida
statute
which
had
been
recently
held
to
be
constitutional
in
your
case
in
proffitt
v.
state
of
florida,
whether
or
not
application
of
that
particular
death
penalty
provision
statute
to
this
defendant
and
this
petitioner
for
an
offense
which
was
allegedly
committed
prior
to
the
enactment
and
also
prior
to
your
decision
in
furman
and
the
date
of
that
offense
for
which
he
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death
was
alleged
to
have
been
december
31,
1971.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
not
after
your
decision
in
furman.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
according
to
the
terms,
would
he
been
punished
by
death,
we
do
not
know
whether
he
would
be
punished
by
death.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
would
he
be
even
subjected
to
death
penalty
if
he
had
been
tried
at
that
time?
mr.
louis
o.
frost
i
submit
no
at
the
time
that
he
was
tried
because
your
decision
in
furman,
by
your
decision
in
furman,
you
left
only
life
imprisonment
for
those
people
who
have
committed
offense
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
well,
if
we
did
not
have
the
1972
statute
to
compare
with
it,
yes
that
would
be
the
answer,
but
if
you
eliminate
furman,
then
you
have
to
go
on
and
compare
the
two
statutes.
the
one
that
was
enacted
effective
december
8,
1972
with
the
one
that
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
his
offense
and
to
determine
whether
or
not
you
got
an
ex
post
facto
violation,
you
have
to
compare
those
two
statutes.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
well,
it
is
two-fold
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
one,
that
he
could
not
receive
the
death
penalty
in
any
event
because
of
your
decision
in
furman
for
a
pre-furman
offense
when
it
was
tried
subsequent
to
the
enactment
of
the
new
statute.
that
is
number
one
because
there
was
no
valid
death
penalty
provision
in
effect
in
florida
after
your
decision
in
furman.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
and
the
second
part
is
regardless
of
furman,
if
you
take
furman
away
and
assume
that
you
never
decided
furman
then
you
have
to
compare
the
two
statutes
and
the
second
point
is
that,
at
the
time
of
his
trial,
it
is
two-fold.
number
one,
the
statute
in
existence
at
the
time
of
this
trial
provided
for
recommendation
of
mercy
as
being
a
binding
sentence
of
life
imprisonment.
in
other
words,
if
he
would
have
been
tried,
convicted
and
a
jury
by
10
to
2
or
whatever
what
majority
had
recommended
mercy
then
he
could
not
have
received
the
death
penalty.
however,
under
the
1972
statute,
under
which
he
was
tried
and
convicted,
the
judge
did
not
have
to
follow
that
recommendation
and
the
petitioner
lost
the
right
that
substantive
right
to
have
that
bonding
recommendation
of
the
jury
regardless
of
whatever
the
verdict
was.
regardless
even
if
it
was
a
recommendation
under
the
first
statute
he
had
the
right
to
the
potential
of
having
the
jury
came
back
with
a
majority
recommendation
and
if
so
he
would
have
only
received
a
life
sentence.
whereas
under
the
new
statute
that
would
not
be
the
case
and
could
not
be
if
the
judge
could
have
followed
recommendation
or
could
not
have.
the
judge
had
the
ultimate
sentencing
power
under
the
new
case.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
no,
if
the
jury
did
not
recommend
mercy,
he
got
the
death.
does
that
answer
your
question
sir?
mr.
louis
o.
frost
and
the
second
point,
in
addition
to
the
right
to
have
that
binding
recommendation
from
the
jury,
he
also
had
the
right
under
the
old
statute
that
if
he
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
that
he
would
be
eligible
for
parole
as
decide
upon
by
the
parole
board
and
parole
commission
at
any
time
after
he
served
six
months
in
the
state
of
florida,
he
would
be
eligible,
when
and
if
he
was
paroled
after
that
time
except
to
the
board.
however,
under
the
new
statute
that
he
was
tried
and
then
was
convicted
under,
under
that
statute
if
he
is
convicted
and
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
he
has
to
serve
a
minimum
period
of
25
years
before
he
is
eligible
for
any
parole.
so
again,
we
submit
that
regardless
of
furman,
and
if
you
just
take
furman
out
when
comparing
this
to
two
statutes
that
we
have
here,
there
was
an
additional
substantive
right
that
he
is
deprived
of
when
the
new
statute
is
applied
to
him
and
that
of
being
tried
under
statute
which
carries
the
potential
of
him
being
convicted,
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
and
having
to
serve
25
years
of
that
sentence
before
he
would
be
entitled
to
parole.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
that
did
not
happen,
but
as
i
read
your
decision
of
this
court
in
lindsey
v.
washington,
that
is
not
the
test.
the
test
is
whether
the
standard
by
which
we
go
by
whether
or
not
that
potential
existed
and
not
whether
or
not
he
actually
got
life
imprisonment
or
not.
it
was
inherent
within
the
statute
that
that
could
have
happened
at
the
time
that
he
went
in.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
well,
that
was
not
even
a
death
penalty
case
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
it
was
a
15-year
penalty
provision
where
it
was
subsequently
changed
that
the
judge
had
to
give
them
a
minimum
sentence
of
15
years
and
in
the
first
case,
it
was
any
term
of
years
up
to
15
and
in
the
trial,
in
the
reverse
they
tried
him
under
the
new
statute
and
the
judge
gave
him
15
years
which
was
the
same
that
he
had
gotten
under
the
original
statute.
however,
under
the
second
statute,
he
was
not
eligible
for
parole
until
he
had
completed
the
15
years
wherein
the
first
instance
he
could
or
at
least
not
eligible
until
the
parole
board
considered
whereas
in
the
first
case,
he
would
have
been
eligible
after
he
completed
his
time
had
nothing
more
hanging
on
his
head.
so
they
looked
at
the
standard
and
he
got
was
the
same
standards,
he
is
got
15
years.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
well,
a
different
parole
rights.
he
had
to
do
15
years
before
he
was
eligible
for
parole.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
i
think
so,
if
the
statute
is
standing
there
and
would
deprive
him
of
the
potential
substantive
right
that
could
work
to
his
detriment
and
we
must
look
at
the
standard.
now,
in
the
binding
recommendation
of
mercy
from
the
jury
there
is
no
question
about
it
there.
it
was
only
potential
there,
but
in
fact
it
did
happen
in
that
case.
the
jury
did
come
back
10
to
2
for
life
and
the
judge
overruled
that
10
to
2
and
gave
him
death.
now,
the
petitioner
also
would
argue
that
to
apply
the
new
1972
death
penalty
provisions
to
the
petitioner
was
a
violation
of
equal
protection
law
as
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
in
that
regard,
we
said
in
the
brief
that
this
may
have
been
better
framed
in
the
past
you
have
in
due
process
argument
in
relationship
to
the
constitution
of
provision
that
was
in
existence
at
the
time
the
defense
was
committed.
at
that
time,
florida
had
a
savings
clause
in
their
constitution,
article
10,
section
9
of
constitution
and
that
saving
clause
was
not
applied
in
this
case
to
this
petition
and
that
saving
clause
in
our
constitution
which
was
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
trial
regardless
of
the
ex
post
facto.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
due
to
the
lunch
break,
i
like
to
just
briefly
capsule
the
petition’s
position
to
this
point.
number
one,
the
petitioner
asserts
that
because
of
your
decision
in
furman
there
was
no
longer
a
death
penalty
in
effect
in
the
state
of
florida,
and
therefore,
the
punishment
was
changed
when
they
applied
the
new
statute
to
this
petitioner.
in
other
words,
the
punishment
was
changed
from
death
to
life.
in
other
words,
is
should
have
been
life,
but
he
got
death.
number
two,
regardless
of
the
decision
in
furman,
the
petitioner
asserts
that
there
has
been
a
change
in
punishment
to
his
detriment,
a
substantial
change
and
that
under
the
old
law,
if
it
had
been
applied,
he
would
have
received
the
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
because
of
the
recommendation
tended
to
by
the
jury.
two,
that
regardless
of
furman,
when
the
petitioner,
if
he
went
to
trial
on
the
old
statute,
he
would
have
had
the
opportunity
to
have
the
binding
recommendation
of
the
jury
to
mercy
which
was
not
the
case
under
the
new
statute
to
judge,
whether
that
be
right
or
wrong,
he
still
had
the
right
to
have
that
binding
recommendation
and
substantive
right
was
taken
away
from
him
and
in
this
case
it
worked
to
his
substantive
detriment.
and
number
three,
regardless
of
furman
that
the
new
statute
also
had
a
right
that
was
taken
away
from
him
in
the
old
statute
and
that
is
the
new
statute
had
annexed
to
it
a
provision
of
25
years
without
parole
if
he
had
a
life
imprisonment
sentence
and
that
is
the
petitioner’s
brief
capsule
to
this
point.
i
just
mentioned
that
at
this
point,
when
we
recess
that
the
petition
also
asserted
that
applying
the
new
statute
to
his
case
was
violation
of
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
i
indicated
to
the
court
that
that
argument
may
have
been
better
framed
in
the
brief
in
the
case
and
also
in
the
way
of
due
process
because
of
the
fact
that
at
the
time
that
the
petitioner
was
tried,
the
constitution
of
state
of
florida
provided
and
had
a
savings
clause
which
saving
clause
was
article
10,
section
9
of
the
constitution
and
provided
that
repeal
of
criminal
statutes.
the
repeal
or
amendment
of
the
criminal
statute
shall
not
affect
prosecution
or
punishment
for
any
crime
previously
committed.
now,
the
case
law
in
florida
has
continually
interpreted
that
constitution
of
provision
in
the
same
manner
as
ex
post
facto.
in
other
words,
they
say
that
you
cannot
apply
a
repeal
or
amendment
of
a
statute
that
affects
the
prosecution
or
punishment
retroactively,
but
only
prospectively
from
the
date
of
the
new
statute.
in
this
case,
the
court
ignored
that
constitutional
provision
and
applied
it.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
the
trial
court,
mr.
justice.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida
also,
but
they
did
not
listen
to
our
argument
on
that
point,
they
did
not
mention
this
so,
apparently
they
did
not
follow
it
because
they
said
nothing
about
it.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
i
wish
they
would.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
if
you
would
remand
the
case
back
to
them?
well,
i
think
they
should
follow
their
own
law,
yes
sir,
i
think
they
should
and
i
think
the
law
was
settled.
in
fact,
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
florida
in
construing
that
very
provision
of
our
savings
clause
in
the
constitution
and
asked
them
to
a
question
from
a
state
attorney
within
our
state
wherein
a
statute
had
been
changed
regarding
rape.
prior
to
1972,
the
rape
statute
in
the
state
of
florida,
if
a
person
was
convicted
and
received
a
recommendation
of
mercy
from
the
jury,
the
trial
court
could
impose
a
sentence
of
any
number
of
years
up
to
and
including
life
imprisonment.
in
1972,
our
code
was
changed
and
it
made
rape
a
capital
felony,
but
also
provided
if
there
was
no
recommendation
of
mercy,
in
other
words,
you
could
just
get
life
imprisonment.
he
could
not
get
any
term
of
years
up
to
including
life
and
in
construing
that
provision,
the
attorney
general
state
of
florida
in
official
opinion
in
that
state
took
the
position
that
this
particular
enactment
could
not
be
applied
retroactively
to
someone
who
committed
an
offense
prior
to
the
enactment
of
a
new
code
in
january
of
1972.
so
therefore
anyone
who
committed
a
rape
prior
to
the
time
he
received
a
recommendation
and
was
tried
subsequently
thereto
still
had
the
benefit
of
getting
any
term
of
years
up
to
including
life
imprisonment
and
we
say
that
to
apply
this
law
and
to
this
petitioner
in
this
case
in
the
same
fashion,
whether
it
even...
they
even
used
this
case
in
the
state
of
florida
in
its
construction
when
they
changed
the
mode
of
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
from
hanging
to
electrocution
and
this
court
has
commented
on
that
in
its
case
of
malloy
v.
south
carolina
and
said
well,
that
was
not
ex
post
facto
as
such.
but
even
in
the
state
of
florida,
this
savings
clause
provision
and
they
cited
in
one
of
the
cases
in
florida,
washington
v.
florida,
they
cited
this
savings
clause
provision
and
said
that
a
man
who
brought
a
petition
on
habeas
because
they
were
going
to
electrocute
him
pursuant
to
the
new
statute
that
had
been
passed,
said
no,
he
is
entitled
to
be
hung
under
the
provisions
of
the
old
statute
and
they
applied
the
savings
clause
to
him.
therefore,
we
say
it
is
denial
of
equal
protection
law
to
this
petitioner
to
not
have
old
law
apply
to
him
as
opposed
to
the
new
statute.
in
addition,
on
the
equal
protection
argument,
if
we
allow
the
petitioner
to
receive
the
death
penalty
as
in
this
case,
then
we
have
denied
him
equal
protection
of
the
law
because
we
placed
him
in
the
class
that
he
is
going
to
receive
the
death
penalty
simply
because
of
the
date
of
his
trial
when
he
is
tried.
and
if
we
assume
for
example
that
a
co-defendant
had
been
his
wife
and
that
she
was
charged
with
the
same
heinous
or
atrocious
acts
which
this
petitioner
was
charged
and
she
was
apprehended,
tried
and
convicted,
prior
to
decision
in
furman,
she
would
have
had
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death,
her
sentence
would
have
been
commuted
to
life
as
everyone
else’s
sentence
on
death
row
in
florida
was
commuted
to
life.
but
because
he
is
tried
subsequent
to
the
enactment
of
the
new
statute,
then
the
obvious
invidious
discrimination
is
that
he
gets
death
simply
because
of
the
date
of
his
trial.
now,
what
could
be
a
more
freakish
application
of
the
death
penalty
to
this
petitioner
than
to
have
him
place
in
that
class
simply
because
of
the
date
of
trial
and
the
recent
decision
before
the
supreme
court
in
reversing
in
the
case
of
lee
which
was
a
crime
committed
pre
furman
who
had
been
sentenced
to
death
had
this
sentence
commuted
to
life.
they
went
up
and
said
it
was
an
ex
post
facto,
it
came
back,
back
before
the
supreme
court
again
and
they
ruled
that
his
attorney
had
made
a
motion
to
vacate
and
set
aside
his
death
sentence
pursuant
to
your
decision
of
furman
about
three
or
four
days
after
furman
came
down
and
they
said,
well
it
is
equal
protection
here
that
we
cannot
discriminate
and
put
him
in
a
class
just
because
his
lawyer
was
a
student
and
have
to
file
a
motion
shortly
after
your
decision
in
furman
to
satisfy
and
vacate
his
death
penalty.
so,
we
submit
that
to
deny
the
application
of
the
new
statute
and
deny
this
to
him
also
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
additional
point
which
we
raise
in
this
case
is
that
the
trial
court
erred
in
failure
to
change
venue
and
change
it
to
some
other
county
in
the
state
of
florida
other
than
duval
county
where
the
case
was
tried.
and
i
think
we
have
to
look
that
in
light
of
your
recent
decision,
the
opinion
written
by
justice
marshall
in
murphy
v.
florida
and
looking
at
it
in
that
light,
i
would
state
that
our
case
is
distinguishable
from
the
murphy
case
for
the
following
reasons;
number
one
this
case
is
a
death
case
and
this
is
not
a
robbery
case
or
a
burglary
case
as
was
a
situation
in
“murphy”
to
assert
and
in
this
case
since
it
is
a
death
penalty
case
and
in
other
words
the
petitioner
here
is
sentenced
to
death.
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
circumstances
that
surrounded
more
closely
to
see
that
we
do
apply
fundamental
fairness
in
a
situation
such
as
this
and
that
we
are
cautious
in
whether
or
not
the
trial
court
should
have
or
should
have
not
granted
a
change
of
venue.
number
two,
that
this
case
is
different
because
of
the
very
nature
of
the
offense;
child
torture
and
child
killing
of
two
of
his
minor
children,
and
therefore,
the
very
odious
nature
of
these
facts
make
people
get
prejudices
just
because
they
hear
the
case
on
voir
dire,
just
when
you
mention
it
to
them.
and
three..
mr.
louis
o.
frost
yes
sir,
they
heard
it
at
the
trial.
they
heard
it,
but
the
mere
fact
that
they
heard
it
at
pre-trial
and
they
knew
something
about
it,
coupled
with
the
continuous
press
that
was
going
on
from
the
time
of
the
offense
until
a
later
part
when
he
was
tried,
convicted,
and
sentenced
to
death.
i
am
saying
that
alone
may
not
be
enough
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
the
death
penalty,
the
odious
nature
of
the
crime
and
three
the
mass
local
community
scene,
in
other
words,
just
is
in
the
case
like
most
of
the
cert
had
national
publicity
in
the
star
of
india
surrounding
him
and
possibly
could
have
been
may
be
tried
nowhere
else
in
the
state,
but
this
defendant
could
have
been
tried
in
another
county
other
than
the
duval
county
and
because
of
this,
we
feel
that
the
court
should
have
changed
venue
and
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
it
pleases
the
court.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
well,
as
justice
chase
announced
in
calder
v.
bull,
we
say
this
is
one
of
the
category
three
that
a
person
should
not
be
subjected
to
an
increased
penalty
at
the
time
he
has
tried
over
what
he
could
have
received
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
defense.
in
other
words,
when
you
compare
the
two
statutes
or
you
compare
what
was
the
punishment
then
and
the
punishment
now,
if
it
in
fact
increased
that
punishment
or
additionally
deprived
the
defendant
of
a
substantive
right,
some
substantive
right
that
he
was
entitled
to
under
the
old
statute
then
it
is
ex
post
facto.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
well,
i
would
concede
that,
no
sir.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
well,
i
think
the
bouie
case
was
one
where
it
applied
in
judicial
decisions.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
the
bouie.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
would
you
repeat
that,
i
am
not
sure
i
quite
understand
that
mr.
justice
blackmun?
mr.
louis
o.
frost
yes
sir.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
well,
i
think
that
is
really
immaterial
when
we
are
considering
ex
post
facto
application
of
the
law.
we
are
nit
her
to
go
into
that
as
to
whether
profitt
decided
that
this
statute
met
constitutional
muster
and
whether
or
not
it
was
in
fact
a
better
statute
than
the
previous
statute
that
had
the
recommendation
of
mercy
from
the
jury
without
guidelines,
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
ex
post
facto
application
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
i
think
that
we
have
to
remember
that
when
we...
mr.
louis
o.
frost
any
procedural
change,
no
sir,
i
do
not
take
that
position.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
whatever
you
call
it,
whether
it
be
called
procedural
or
not,
this
is
certainly
a
procedure.
if
you
want
to
say
it
is
a
procedure,
one
procedure
for
invoking
the
death
penalty
here,
one
procedure
for
invoking
death
penalty
over
here,
but
if
that
procedure
deprives
the
defendant,
the
person
that
is
being
subjected
to
the
new
law
of
a
substantive
right
then
it
is
ex
post
facto.
in
other
words,
if
that
right
is
a
substantive
right
and
it
works
to
his
substantial
detriment
and
what
could
be
more
than
a
substantive
right
of
life
itself
and
what
could
more
of
a
detriment
to
this
petitioner
than
to
have
his
substantive
right
of
life
taken
away
and
given
death.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
yes
sir,
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
a
substantive
right
that
he
had
been
deprived
off
if
they
increase
the
penalty
and
has
the
penalty
annex
to
the
crime.
yes
sir,
i
would.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
well,
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
no,
furman
came
along,
furman
is
the
law.
your
decision
in
furman
is
the
law
and
that
law
took
away
the
death
penalty.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
but
under
the
law
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
he
would
have
gotten
life
imprisonment
because
it
tended
to
recommendation
of
a
mercy
from
the
jury
would
have
been
binding
on
the
trial
court.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
i
do
not
think
it
is
speculation
mr.
blackmun,
they
heard
all
this
atrocious,
heinous
facts
that
came
out
in
this
trial
for
five
days
and
they
heard
every
one
of
these
facts.
mr.
louis
o.
frost
sir?
mr.
louis
o.
frost
they
heard
everyone
of
these
facts
and
they
still
recommended
mercy.
thank
you.
