justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
at
the
outset,
suppose
there
is
an
application
to
tap
or
intercept
conversations
of
jones
phone,
over
jones?s
phone
and
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
jones
is
engaged
in
the
some
conspiracy.
there
is
also
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
is
engaged
in
the
criminal
conspiracy
with
brown,
but
brown
is
not
named,
but
there
is
no
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
is
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
with
smith.
now,
when
the
tap
goes
and
they
hear
conversations
with
both
of
these
other
people,
both
brown
and
smith.
now,
is
your
position
that
brown?s
conversations
are
excludible
and
smith?s
are
admissible?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
just
make
sure
here,
smith?s
conversation,
the
unknown
person,
is
against
any
indictment
in
a
criminal
case
against
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
argument
about
that
in
the
cases,
that
the
conversation
is
between
the
target
and
smith
are
admissible
against
them
both.
