mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
the
government?s
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit,
which
affirmed
an
order
of
the
district
court,
suppressing
certain
evidence
obtained
during
wire
interceptions
as
the
five
respondents
in
this
case.
there
are
two
separate
issues,
one
of
which
relates
to
three
of
the
respondents?
and
concerns
the
obligations
of
the
government
to
identify
certain
persons
in
the
application
and
of
the
court
to
identify
them
in
the
order
authorizing
the
wire
interception.
the
second
concerns
the
obligation
of
the
government
to
supply
names
to
the
district
court
for
purposes
of
discretionary
service
of
inventory
notice
after
an
interception
has
terminated.
and
underlying
both
these
issues,
assuming
the
government
did
not
live
up
to
its
responsibilities
under
the
statute
is
a
question
whether
suppression
of
the
evidence
is
an
appropriate
remedy.
in
november
1972,
a
federal
district
judge
in
cleveland
authorized
the
interception
of
wire
communications
relating
to
gambling
offenses
over
four
telephones.
the
application
for
this
authorization
was
supported
by
an
extensive
affidavit,
which
takes
up
48
pages
of
the
appendix
in
this
court.
the
principle
targets
of
the
investigation
were
three
suspected
bookmakers,
kotoch,
spaganlo,
and
florea,
and
both
the
application
and
the
court
order
named
them
as
well
as
three
other
individuals
who
were
expected
to
be
overheard
during
the
interceptions
discussing
the
gambling
enterprises.
several
weeks
after
the
termination
of
the
initial
interception,
application
was
made
to
the
court
for
authorization
for
an
extension
of
the
interception
on
two
of
the
four
original
phones
and
also
for
monitoring
of
the
third
phone.
the
application
and
order
named
two
new
persons
and
deleted
the
names
of
three
individuals
who
had
been
identified
in
the
first
go
around.
respondents?
donovan,
robbins
and
buzzacco
were
not
specifically
identified
in
either,
the
application
or
order,
original
or
extension.
the
district
court
in
a
suppression
hearing,
upon
review
of
various
items
or
information
in
the
government?s
possession
of
the
time,
the
renewal
application
was
filed,
determined
that
there
was
in
fact
probable
cause
to
believe
that
these
respondents
would
be
overheard
discussing
illegal
gambling
conversations
during
the
second
interception
and
because
they
have
not
been
identified
in
the
application
and
order,
the
district
court
suppressed
their
conversations
from
use
in
evidence
against
them,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
as
to
respondents
merlo
and
lauer,
there
is
no
question
about
the
initial
propriety
of
the
overhearing
of
their
conversation.
however,
after
the
interception
was
completed,
the
government
supplied
the
authorizing
judge
with
the
names
of
37
persons
who
had
been
identified
as
being
overheard
during
their
surveillance.
service
of
inventories
on
these
persons
was
ordered
by
the
court
and
was
carried
out.
subsequently,
the
government
realized
that
it
had
omitted
to
inform
the
judge
of
the
identities
of
two
other
persons
and
it
obtained
an
amended
order
and
served
additional
inventories.
however,
merlo
and
lauer
were
not
named
to
the
judge
and
did
not
receive
a
service
of
inventory.
they
were
thereafter
indicted
and
after
the
indictment,
they
as
well
as
all
the
other
defendants
were
given
access
to
the
orders,
the
application
and
the
transcripts
of
the
intercepted
conversations.
everybody
had
access
at
the
same
time.
the
district
court
ordered
suppression
of
the
intercepting
conversation
of
merlo
and
lauer
because
if
the
government?s
failure
to
supply
their
names
to
the
judge,
so
that
the
judge
could
determine
whether
discretionary
notice
of
the
taps
should
be
served
upon
them.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
neither
court
below
found
at
the
failure
to
supply
the
names
for
inventory
purposes
was
anything
other
then
inadvertent
or
that
these
respondents
did
not
in
fact
know
long
before
they
were
indicted
that
they
had
been
overheard,
or
that
there
was
any
prejudice
to
them
as
a
result
of
the
delay
in
official
notification
of
the
hearings.
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
stands
rather
for
an
absolute
rule
requiring
suppression
regardless
of
lack
of
governmental
misconduct
or
prejudiced
self-defense.
now,
of
the
two
issues
before
the
court,
the
one
concerning
the
identification
of
persons
in
the
application
and
orders
by
far
the
most
important
to
the
future
administration
of
the
act
and
it
is
to
that
issue
that
i
plan
to
devote
the
bulk
of
my
argument.
the
inventory
issue
was
less
important.
it
is
now
the
government?s
policy,
even
though
we
do
not
believe
the
act
compels
us
to
do
so,
to
supply
the
supervising
judge
with
the
names
of
all
overheard
persons
as
to
whom
we
believe
there
is
any
reasonable
prospect
of
indictment.
perhaps
the
approach
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
which
suggested
that
rather
than
submitting
specific
names,
we
should
submit
categories
of
persons
who
had
been
overheard
is
a
better
policy
would
be
more
helpful.
the
district
court
in
exercising
its
discretion
and
we
would
have
no
objection
to
following
any
reasonable
policy
that
the
district
courts
determine
would
be
useful
to
them
in
this
area.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
as
to
the
inventory
notice,
that
is
right.
however,
whatever
the
rules
may
be,
suppression
of
the
evidence
is
an
inappropriate
and
unauthorized
response
in
these
cases
and
it
is
on
that
point
that
i
want
to
make
a
few
brief
observations
before
i
turn
to
the
identification
question.
first
of
all
section
2518
(10)
(a)
which
is
the
suppression
provision
and
which
has
set
forth,
i
believe
at
page
5(a)
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
authorizes
district
courts
to
suppress,
on
one
of
three
grounds;
that
the
communication
was
unlawfully
intercepted,
that
the
order
of
authorization
or
approval
was
insufficient
on
its
face,
or
that
the
interception
was
not
made
in
conformity
with
the
order
and
none
of
these
grounds
is
applicable
to
a
postintercept
failure
to
comply
with
the
procedures
that
follow
and
it
is
our
argument
that
you
cannot
suppress
under
the
statute
for
a
failure
to
comply
with
post
intercept
procedures.
now,
i
point
out
in
this
connection
that
we
at
congress
wish
to
exclude
evidence
for
postintercept
defects,
it
is
specifically
so
provided.
for
example,
section
2518
(8)
(a)
which
is
not
in
the
appendix,
concerns
the
sealing
and
it
provides
that
after
the
interception
is
terminated,
the
tapes
must
be
turned
over
promptly
to
the
district
court
for
sealing
and
it
further
provides
that
the
absence
of
seal
called
for
in
that
section
or
satisfactory
explanation
for
the
absence
means
that
the
evidence
is
to
be
excluded,
that
is
a
specific
exclusionary
rule
dealing
with
a
postintercept
failure.
similarly
and
more
directly
in
point
in
this
case
is
section
2518
(9)
of
the
statute.
that
is
the
provision
that
sets
forth
the
congressional
requirement
of
notice
and
to
see
them
to
the
admission
of
evidence
in
a
case
that
is
notice
to
the
defendant
of
the
fact
that
he
has
been
intercepted.
that
provision
says
that
the
contents
of
any
intercepted
wire
or
oral
communication
or
evidence
derived
there
from
shall
not
be
received
in
evidence
or
otherwise
disclosed,
unless
each
party
not
less
than
ten
days
before
the
trial
hearing
or
preceding
has
been
furnished
with
a
copy
of
the
court
order
accompanying
application
etcetera.
that
is
congress
had
said,
what
is
necessary,
respondents
merlo
and
lauer
have
gotten
the
information
that
is
necessary,
it
is
still
more
then
ten
days
before
their
trial,
we
think
there
is
no
ground,
therefore,
for
excluding.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
not
as
to
these
respondents,
they
were
served.
one
final
point
in
discussing
the
giordano,
chavez
analysis
here,
of
course
the
courts
have
focused
on
the
question
of
centrality.
now,
we
do
not
deny
that
the
inventory
notice
concept
is
a
central
part
of
the
statute,
but
that
to
us
does
not
answer
the
question
that
must
be
answered
before
determining
whether
to
suppress
and
that
is
whether
the
particular
kind
of
defect
in
the
procedures
is
itself
so
central
to
the
statute,
that
is
here
whether
the
fact
that
only
39
people
rather
than
41
people
were
named
is
so
central
to
the
statute
in
the
absence
to
prejudice
to
the
defendants,
that
suppression
is
an
appropriate
remedy.
we
say
clearly
is
not.
now
turning
to
the
naming
issue;
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
government?s
obligation
to
identify
extends
to
all
persons
whom
a
government
has
probable
cause
to
believe
at
well
over
here
talking
over
the
monitored
telephones
about
the
criminal
activities
under
investigation.
we
submit
that
the
language
and
structure
of
the
act,
its
legislative
history
and
substantial
policy
considerations
dictate
a
much
never
interpretation
of
that
requirement.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
saying
a
word
about
the
dictum
in
kahn
because
several
courts
of
appeals
that
have
examined
this
question
have
really
stopped
their
inquiry
after
they
looked
at
the
dictum
in
kahn.
kahn
was
a
very
different
case.
kahn
concerned
the
question
of
who
among
the
people
whose
phone
was
being
monitored
had
to
be
named
in
the
order
and
kahn
held
that
the
only
where
you
have
probable
cause
that
you
have
the
name
somebody
who?s
phone
was
being
intercepted.
kahn
did
not
concern
the
question
of
your
responsibilities
to
name
people
who
are
calling
into
the
intercepted
phone
from
phones
that
are
not
themselves
being
monitored.
it
was
not
briefed.
it
was
not
argued.
it
was
not
necessary
of
the
court?s
decision
and
i
do
not
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
kahn
dictum
suggests
that
the
issue
was
in
anyway
for
(voice
overlap).
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
oh!
yes
it
was.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
actually
she
was
at
home
but
the
point
of
our
position
is
that?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
is
right
and
what
we
are
saying
is
the
naming
obligation
extends
to
people
who
are
users
of
the
telephone
that
is
being
intercepted
in
the
case
of
a
telephone
interception.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
certainly,
the
kahn
family?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
they
were
not.
their
telephones
were
not
being
monitored.
they
were
calling
in
from
outside.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
yes
but
the
difference.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
difference
is
on
which
end
of
the
phone
that
is
when?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
it
does,
yes
and
i
intend
to
get
to
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
it
was
the
phone
at
the
family
that
is
these
phones
were
the
phones
of
the
kahn
family.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
was
the
kahn
household
telephone
and
our
position
would
be
that,
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
require
the
government
to
identify
those
people
whose
phone
is
being
intercepted
and
i
think
the
statute
focuses
as
i
will
get
to
in
just
a
moment
on
whose
telephone
is
being
intercepted,
that
is
the
person
the
congress
was
talking
about
in
the
statute.
section
2518
(1)
(b),
says
that
the
application
must
state
?the
identity
of
the
person,
if
known,
committing
the
offense
and
whose
communications
are
to
be
intercepted.?
now,
we
submit
that
in
this
case
that
requirement
was
fully
met
when
the
application
named
kotoch,
spaganlo,
and
florea.
these
were
the
targets,
these
were
the
persons
who
were
expected
to
be
overheard
talking
from
the
phones
that
were
being
monitored
about
the
illegal
activities.
now,
the
first
thing
to
notice,
i
have
stressed,
is
the
singular
were
the
person
in
the
statute.
now,
in
the
new
york
statute
which
was
the
model
for
this
particular
provision
in
a
federal
statute
and
which
is
quoted
cited
in
berger,
in
the
opinion
in
berger,
the
new
york
statute
provided
the
person
or
persons
had
to
be
identified.
congress
dropped
four
persons
out
of
the
federal
statute
only
the
person
need
be
identified.
now
we
think
if
the
congressional
notion
was
it
they
would
be
one
target
in
these
cases
that
it
would
be
the
target?s
phone
that
would
be
monitored
and
that
that
was
the
person
who
should
be
named,
if
that
person
was
known.
the
critical
distinction
and
its
one
we
believe
is
clearly
built
into
the
statute
and
it
is
when
we
urge
the
court
to
recognize
in
its
decision,
is
between
the
users
of
the
telephone
that
is
being
monitored
on
the
one
hand
and
all
other
persons
throughout
the
world
who
make
converse
from
unmonitored
phones
on
the
other
hand,
the
naming
of
requirement
applies
to
former
in
our
view
and
not
to
the
later.
now,
there
is
internal
evidence
in
the
statute,
i
think
that
supports
this
quite
clearly.
if
you
look
at
page
2
(a)
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief
and
3
(a)
we
set
forth
there
subsection
2518
(3)
which
talks
about
what
the
judge
must
find
in
determining
the
issue
on
authorization.
a
subsection
(a)
says
the
judge
must
find
that
there
is
probable
cause
for
belief
that
an
individual
is
committing,
has
committed,
or
is
about
to
commit
a
particular
offense.
subsection
(d)
which
ties
in
with
this
says
that
and
i
am
going
to
edit
it
slightly,
there
is
probable
cause
for
belief
that
the
facilities
from
which,
or
the
place
where
the
wire
communications
are
to
be
intercepted
that
those
facilities
are
being
used
or
about
to
be
used
in
connection
with
the
commission
of
such
offense,
or
are
leased
to,
listed
in
the
name
of,
or
commonly
used
by
such
person.
now,
the
such
person
that
congress
was
talking
about
there
was
the
individual
who
has
committed
the
offense.
the
structure
of
the
statute
ties
a
particular
individual,
a
particular
telephone,
a
particular
offense
and
we
think
that,
that
is
further
reinforced
by
subsection
four
which
deals
with
what
the
contents
of
the
?authorizing
order
shall
include?.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
is
right.
i
think
if
we
expect
over
here
that
is,
if
let
us
say
as
may
have
been
in
the
case
and
this
case
one
of
the
targets
uses
his
girlfriend?s
telephone
to
receive
bets
or
relying
information
or
something
like
that,
we
would
agree
that,
that
may
be
a
case
where
he
should
be
named,
but
that
is
because
he
is
a
user
of
the
phone
that
is
being
intercepted.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
think
that
the
identification
requirement
is
tied
to
the
instrument
and
to
the
people
who
are
likely
to
be
using
that
instrument
and
not
to
everybody
in
the
world
and
i
will
get
in
little
bit
to
some
of
the
practical
reasons
for
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
understand
to
that
could
be,
i
am
not
suggesting
we
have?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
when
i
am
talking
about
everybody
in
the
world,
i
making
distinction
between
the
users
of
the
phone.
i
understand
the
probable
cause
is
a
requirement
in
any
event,
if
we
do
not
have
probable
cause,
we
do
not
have
to
name
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
think
we
would
say
that
she
should
have
been
named.
you
can
argue
about
whether
when
you
name
on?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
because
it
was
her
telephone
that
was
being
monitored.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
what
we
expected,
when
we
overheard,
assuming
we
had
probable
cause,
we
would
have
expected
to
overhear
her
engaging
in
criminal
conversations
from
that
phone
rather
then
calling
in
from
an
outside.
in
the
kahn
case
there
was
another
person.
a
layoff
bookie
in
indiana,
who
was
one
of
the
people
who
was
in
this
category,
this
rest
of
the
world
category
that
i
am
talking
about
and
there
was
no
briefing
or
argument
in
kahn,
he
was
not
indicted
and
there
was
no
question
as
to
whether
he
should
have
been
named,
although
arguably
there
was
probable
cause
to
name
him,
but
we
think
that
he
is
in
a
different
position
from
mrs.
kahn.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
because
she
is
a
user
of
the
phone,
because
on
hypothetical
we
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
we
will
all
overhear
her
engaging
and
conversations
about
the
criminal
activity
from
the
phone
that
is
being
monitored.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
statute
says
the
person
arguably.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
purposes
of
our
construction,
i
mean
in
another
case,
the
question
of
what
would
happen
if
we
named
only
one
of
two
people
which
is
an
issue
for
instances
in
doolittle
case
where
there
was
a
doolittle
who
was
the
principle
target
and
there
was
a
fellow
name
sanders,
who
was
an
employee
of
doolittle?s,
who
worked
in
doolittle?s
club.
that
poses
different
questions
that
are
not
presented
here,
our
policy
normally
now
is
to
name
such
person?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
am
suggesting
that
the
court
could
conclude
that
it
is
not
absolutely
controlling,
but
i
still
think
it
is
very
significant
because
the
statute
ties
the
person
to
the
facility,
that
is
being
intercepted.
in
subsection
four
at
the
concluding
paragraph
of
2518
(4),
it
says
that
an
order
authorizing
the
interception
of
wire
or
oral
communications
shall
direct
that
say
the
communication
common
carrier
furnish
necessary
assistance,
if
you
look
at
page
(4)
(a)
to
accomplish
the
interception
unobtrusively
and
with
a
minimum
of
interference
with
the
services
that
such
carrier,
landlord
etcetera
is
according
the
person
whose
communications
are
to
be
intercepted.
the
telephone
company?.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
may
be
i
am
confused.
i
think
your
argument
to
be
that
the
government
can
anticipate
and
the
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
government
anticipate
everyone
who
is
going
to
make
a
call
to
a
monitored
phone.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
there
are
problems
with
that
of
that
nature.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
mr.
chief
justice
our
first
position
is
wholly
aside
from
practical
considerations
which
we
think
are
substantial
on
which
i
will
get
to
if
i
have
time.
the
question
is
what
does
the
statute
requires
to
do?
now,
our
position
is
that
the
statute
focuses
on
the
person
whose
telephone
is
being
intercepted.
now,
here
the
person
who?s
communication
are
to
be
intercepted
here,
the
telephone
company
was
not
providing
services
to
donovan,
or
buzzacco,
or
robbins
in
this
case
of
a
kind
that
would
be
interrupted
of
a
kind
for
which
you
needed
a
court
order,
court
assistance
to
direct
their
facilitation.
the
telephone
company
was
providing
the
services
to
kotoch,
to
spaganlo,
to
florea,
to
the
persons
whose
telephones
were
being
intercepted.
so,
that
this
distinction
between
callers
in
from
outside
and
callers
out
from
the
monitored
phone,
is
i
think
built
into
the
statute.
it
is
also
i
believe
built
into
the
--
reflected
and
the
legislative
history.
for
instance
in
the
senate
report
which
is
the
principle
document
in
the
legislative
history
where
they
talk
about
the
inventory
notice
provision,
the
report
says
at
page
105
through,
its
operation
that
is
the
inventory
notice
provision,
all
authorized
interceptions
must
eventually
become
known
at
least
to
the
subject.
he
can
then
seek
appropriate
civil
redress
etcetera.
now,
again
the
concept
of
congress
had,
and
perhaps
it
was
unsophisticated
in
terms
of
the
reality
of
investigations
that
are
taking
place
but
the
concept
that
congress
had
was
it
there
would
be
one
target
and
if
we
knew
who
that
target
was,
as
we
normally
would,
that
target
would
be
named.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
in
practice
more
then
one
person
is
ordinarily
named.
what
we
are
inquiring
into
here
is
the
obligation
to
in
fact
name
people
who
have
probable
cause
to
believe
will
be
calling
in
from
outside
phones,
and
i
just
do
not
think
of
that
obligation
is
contained
in
the
statute
or
it
was
ever
intended
by
congress.
now,
i
just
like
to
say
a
word
a
two
about
the
policy
considerations
because
the
broad
interpretation
of
the
court
of
appeals
accomplishes
very
little
by
way
of
protecting
against
unjustified
intrusions
and
for
the
privacy
of
persons
who
maybe
overheard.
the
statutory
scheme
does
not
limit
the
scope
of
permissible
?authorized
overhearing
in
terms
of
the
identities
of
the
persons
who
maybe
overheard?
but
rather
in
terms
of
the
kinds
of
conversations
that
may
be
overheard.
persons
who
are
not
previously
known
to
be
involved
in
the
criminal
enterprise
maybe
overheard
nevertheless,
as
kahn
plainly
demonstrates.
on
the
other
hand
overhearing
of
all
innocent
conversations
even
those
of
the
named
target
are
supposed
to
be
minimized.
so,
the
primary
interest
of
these
respondents
would
not
have
gained
in
any
significant
respect.
they
would
not
have
gained
one
ounce
of
additional
protection,
had
they
been
named
as
in
the
order
as
they
claim
they
should
have
been,
this
is
not
a
great
honor
to
be
named
in
an
order
of
this
sort.
the
court
of
appeals
broad
naming
requirement
not
only
does
accomplish
anything
in
terms
of
protecting
the
privacy
interest
that
congress
was
legitimately
concerned
when
it
enacted
title
iii,
but
it
also
imposes
significant
administrative
burdens
on
the
government
and
preparing
applications
significant
burdens
on
the
court
in
weighing
and
approving
them,
all
to
no
useful
purpose.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
congress
explained
why
they
did
it,
at
page
101
of
the
senate
report,
congress
said
they
listed
the
requirements
contained
in
subparagraph
2518
(1)
and
they
said
each
of
these
requirements
reflects
the
constitutional
command
of
particularization
and
they
cited
berger
and
berger
had
this
to
say
about
the
naming
requirement.
they
said,
then
the
court
said
at
page
59
of
the
opinion
in
berger
388
u.s,
it
is
true
that
statute
requires
the
naming
of
the
person
or
persons
whose
communications
are
to
be
overheard
or
recorded,
but
this
does
no
more
then
identify
the
person
whose
constitutionally
protected
area
is
to
be
invaded,
rather
then
particularly
describing
the
communications,
conversations
or
discussions
to
be
seized,
and
in
kahn
again
the
court
recognizes
that
there
is
not
congress
was
wrong,
there
is
not
a
constitutional
obligation
to
the
name.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
he
has
no
such
privacy
interest.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
naming
requirement
is
not
tied
to
kinds
of
conversations
that
can
be
overheard
or
the
extent
of
the
permissible
overhearing.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
reason
why
it
should
not,
there
is
a
practical
reason.
i
mean
there
are
several
practical
reasons.
you
have
a
case
like
this
which
is
a
complex
gambling
conspiracy
case
with
people
actually
all
over
the
country
transmitting
line
information,
lying
of
bets,
you
although
hear
many,
many
persons
it
is
a
fast
moving
investigation
and
then
you
are
telling
the
government
that
it
has
to
engage
in
what
essentially
is
a
quite
metaphysical
evaluation
of
all
the
information
in
its
possession
so
that
it
can
tell
the
district
court
that
it
has
or
it
has
not
probable
cause
to
believe
that
it
will
overhear
certain
persons
and
what
it
tells
to
district
court,
what
is
the
district
court
to
do
with
that
information.
if
the
government
has
no
probable
cause,
if
the
district
court
disagrees
with
the
government
then
it
strikes
the
name
from
the
order
and
then
we
can
although
hear
that
person
as
a
person
unknown.
so
it
gives
the
person
no
protection
to
be
stricken
from
the
order.
it
does
nothing
except
it
has
a
lot
of
work
to
the
district
court
and
if
we
name
someone
who
is
at
a
borderline
case
and
we
will
be
forced
to
a
policy
of
over
inclusion
if
we
loose
this
case.
we
will
be
naming
some
people
who
will
not
be
overheard
and
then
when
a
suppression
motion
comes
about
and
the
intercept
order
and
application
are
opened
up
these
people
will
have
in
effect
the
famatory
information
unsupported
by
the
actual
result
of
the
tap
made
public
that
they
were
suspected
by
the
government
of
participating
in
criminal
gambling
enterprises,
narcotics
and
so
on.
so
even
in
terms
of,
i
mean
the
naming
just
does
not
serve
a
substantial
interest
of
the
individuals
nor
does
it
further
the
policy
of
the
act.
i
think
i
would
better
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
do
not
have
any
problem
with
it.
i
do
not
think
they
had
to
provide
for
naming
of
anyone.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
have
a
couple.
first
of
all,
i
want
to
come
back
to
a
point
that
was
apparently
troubling
in
mr.
justice
stevens
about
why
congress
would
want
to
make
it
distinction
between
the
people
whose
phone
was
being
monitored
and
people
calling
in
from
outside.
one
of
the
important
reasons
is
that
the
impact
of
a
wire
interception
differs
greatly
on
the
people,
whose
phone
is
being
intercepted,
whose
every
conversation
is
subject
to
being
overheard
and
the
people
who
may
occasionally,
once
or
twice
during
the
course
of
a
surveillance
that
involves
several
100
telephone
calls
being
listened
to,
maybe
overheard.
there
is
a
much
greater
impact
upon
the
person
whose
phone
is
being
intercepted
and
for
that
reason
it
is
logical
for
congress
to
have
made
the
distinction
that
we
submitted.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
mean
if
we
had
a
case
where
the
primary
target
of
our
investigation
was
somebody
who
we
knew
everyday
was
calling
in
from
outside,
you
might
have
an
issue,
but
these
donovan,
robbins
and
buzzacco
were
very
tangentially?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
would
first
say
that
you
did
not
have
to
name
more
than
one,
but
second
i
would
say
if
you
did
have
to
name
more
than
one,
if
all
five
used
the
phone
it
was
being
monitored,
you
might
have
to
name
them,
but
the
people
with
whom
they
were
doing
business,
people
from
las
vegas
sending
the
line
information
would
not
have
to
be
named
even
though
we
expect
to
overhear
them.
now,
as
far
as
the
point
that
mr.
policy
was
just
making,
we
do
not
need
either
under
the
constitution
or
under
the
statute
probable
cause
as
to
any
person
in
order
to
have
the
interception.
all
we
need
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
an
offense
is
being
committed
and
at
this
telephone
has
being
used
and
the
conversations
relating
to
the
act
will
be
intercepted.
there
can
be
no
person.
the
statute
does
not
require
us
to
name
a
person
if
we
do
not
know
one.
it
is
neither
a
constitutional
or
statutory
requirement,
and
it
is
plainly
i
think
for
that
reason
not
central.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
statute
requires
us
to
identify,
yes,
we
could
see
that,
we
have
to
identify
a
person
whose
phone
is
being
tapped.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
may
have
probable
cause,
but
it
is
our
contention
that
we
do
not
have
to
name
them
and
we
certainly
would
not
have
the
name
them
unless
we
sought
a
renewal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
do
not
know,
i
even
think
kahn
said
we
did
not
have
to
investigate
to
find
out.
that
would
be
terribly
burdensome
in
these
investigation,
we
could
not
do
it,
we
have
too
many
people,
we
would
be
spending
all
our
time
on
something
that
is
really
a
totally
irrelevancy
to
the
administration
of
the
act.
i
am
not
saying
that
the
naming
of
the
target
as
irrelevancy,
the
naming?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
is
not
irrelevant
to
him,
that
he
is
been
overheard
and
that
evidence
would
be
introduced
against
him
and
of
course
the
conversations
are
not
irrelevant
to
the
trial,
but
in
terms
of
the
privacy
concerns
that
the
title
iii
is
concerned
with
since
we
can
overhear
as
justice
marshall
pointed
it
out,
people
of
whom
we
have
no
suspicion,
the
privacy
concerns
are
not,
it
is
not
relevant
to
protecting
people?s
privacy
and
if
it
is
not
relevant
for
that
reason,
we
say
it
is
not
central
to
the
act
and
the
court
should
not
go
out
of
its
way
to
construe
the
statute
to
impose
what
is
an
administratively
burdensome
requirement
which
will
make
life
also
very
difficult
for
judges
who
already
have
46
page
applications
to
read
over
and
we
have
146
page
applications
if
we
have
to
show
all
the
probable
cause
we
have
with
a
far
flung
conspiracy
as
to
every
person
around
the
country.
thank
you.
