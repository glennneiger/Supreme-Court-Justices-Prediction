justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
here
from
the
sixth
circuit
presents
a
number
of
issues
under
title
iii
of
the
federal
wiretap
statute.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
the
court
holds
first
that
applications
for
judicial
authorization
of
wiretaps
must
identify
all
persons
whose
relevant
conversations
the
government
has
probable
cause
to
believe
it
will
intercept.
the
statutory
requirements
are
not
satisfied
when
the
government
identifies
only
the
principal
target
of
the
investigation.
the
court
grab
and
holds
that
the
government
must
supply
the
issuing
judge
with
sufficient
information
of
other
parties
who
are
overheard
to
enable
him
to
decide
whether
such
parties
must
be
notified
of
the
interception.
finally,
we
hold
that
under
all
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
failure
of
the
government
to
comply
fully
with
these
statutory
obligations
did
not
make
the
intercept
unlawfully.
we
therefore
conclude
that
it
was
error
to
suppress
the
evidence
obtained
by
these
interceptions.
an
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
readdressed
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
that
court.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
concurs.
