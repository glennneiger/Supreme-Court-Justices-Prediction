mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
shall
address
myself
to
the
issue
of
identification
as
it
relates
to
the
respondents
donovan,
buzzacco,
and
robbins.
ms.
carmen
a.
policy
that
is
exactly
our
position
mr.
justice
white.
ms.
carmen
a.
policy
assuming
no
probable
cause
existed
and
they
did
not
anticipate
the
interception
of
his
conversations,
that
exactly
our
position,
sir.
ms.
carmen
a.
policy
i
believe
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
your
honor,
i
might
say
that
there
is
no
question,
but
that
the
government
had
probable
cause
that
these
three
respondents
were
in
fact
engaging
in
this
type
of
activity
that
was
under
investigation
and
that
their
conversations
would
in
fact
be
intercepted
and
they
had
this
knowledge
prior
to
the
application
of
december
26,
1972
when
the
government
applied
for
an
extension
of
the
original
wiretap.
it
is
our
position
that
failure
to
list
these
know
individuals
and
said
application
for
the
extension
was
in
fact
the
statutory
violation
of
2518
1(b)4
which
in
fact
resulted
in
additional
violation
of
2518
4(a)
which
requires
the
judge
of
course
to
list
the
identity
of
the
person
if
known
whose
communications
are
to
be
intercepted.
we
can
in
no
way
except
the
government?s
position
that
the
statute
in
question
was
designed
to
cover
the
patron
of
a
telephone
company
and
was
designed
to
cover
only
the
conversation
of
the
patron
or
the
man
they
know
to
use
that
particular
phone
located
at
that
particular
service.
ms.
carmen
a.
policy
mr.
justice
marshall,
one
might
say
that
when
the
government
is
seeking
a
course
of
search
and
seizure
which
is
this
is,
they
were
searching
and
seizing
the
conversations
of
buzzacco,
donovan,
and
robbins
and
they
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
these
men
will
be
intercepted
and
they
are
violating
the
law,
they
have
such
an
obligation
of
at
least
naming
them
by
way
of
statute
and
by
way
of?
ms.
carmen
a.
policy
if
they
have
the
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
would
be
calling.
ms.
carmen
a.
policy
if
they
sought
to
bring
him
within
the
process
of
laws
of
united
states.
ms.
carmen
a.
policy
i
believe
so
sir.
ms.
carmen
a.
policy
if
they
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
was
engaging
in
this
activity.
ms.
carmen
a.
policy
quite
the
contrary
sir.
i
compare
this
to
a
situation
where
the
police
would
actually
come
upon
a
man
in
the
course
a
lawful
search
or
a
lawful
arrest
and
find
him
in
the
commission
of
a
crime.
in
that
situation
they
had
no
foreknowledge
of
his
involvement
or
the
fact
that
they
would
come
upon
him
in
the
commission
of
this
crime,
but
this
does
not
relieve
them
of
the
obligation
to
elicit
a
search
warrant
or
an
arrest
warrant
for
the
individuals
that
have
foreknowledge
of
in
terms
of
their
search
and
arrest.
ms.
carmen
a.
policy
quite
the
contrary
sir.
what
i
think
he
is
doing
is
he
is
saying
to
the
government
here
i
am
giving
you
some
probable
cause
for
you
to
go
ahead
and
solicit
a
court
and
show
a
court
that
your
following
due
process
and
statute
and
bug
my
phone.
ms.
carmen
a.
policy
so
long
as
that
they?
ms.
carmen
a.
policy
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
somewhat
more
descriptive
then
i
am
a
bookmaker.
ms.
carmen
a.
policy
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
carmen
a.
policy
that
is
correct
sir.
probable
cause
at
that
particular
individual?
ms.
carmen
a.
policy
at
that
time,
at
the
time
that
they
were
seeking
the
application
to
be
approved
was
in
fact
probably
engaging
in
this
type
of
activity
and
his
conversation
would
be
intercepted.
both
of
those
keys,
and
i
feel
that
the
reading
of
kahn
tells
us
and
logically
dictates,
that
were
minnie
kahn,
in
fact
known,
prior
to
the
application
being
sought
to
have
been
engaging
in
this
activity
and
probably
using
her
husband?s
phone.
i
feel
that
this
honorable
court
would
have
gone
farther
on
the
decision.
i
would
have
stated
that
the
statute
would
have
required
her
being
listed
in
said
application.
i
feel
mr.
chief
justice,
justices
that
we
have
a
definite
statutory
violation
here
and
when
we
look
the
giordano,
we
are
told
that
a
statutory
violation
shall
result
in
suppression
when
it
hits
that
central
aspect
of
the
statute
and
when
it
hits
an
aspect
of
the
statute
which
was
designed
by
congress
to
limit
the
use
of
this
tool.
now,
i
submit
that
in
berger
and
katz,
two
of
the
key
cases
in
this
situation
that
courts
were
concerned
with
interjecting
and
between
law
enforcement
(inaudible)
wiretapping
tool
some
judicial
restraint
or
at
least
judicial
review.
and
i
feel
this
is
obvious
in
congress?
intent
and
by
allowing
the
government
to
come
forward
and
go
to
a
district
court
judge
without
providing
him
with
the
information
as
to
the
identity
of
those
people
that
it
has
probable
cause
to
believe
will
be
intercepted
and
are
probably
committing
this
crime,
they
are
bypassing,
utilizing
their
own
judgment
in
terms
of
that
decision
making
process
and
taking
away
what
berger,
katz
and
congress
had
intended
to
be
some
judicial
review.
i
further
submit
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
justices
that
there
is
a
practical
effect
to
not
being
named
in
this
particular
application.
as
we
read
on
in
the
section
2518
8
requires
inventory
notice
to
be
served
upon
all
those
named
in
the
application.
now,
this
is
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
application
is
denied,
by
placing
this
man?s
name,
who
is
a
suspect
upon
whom
probable
cause
exists
in
the
application,
he
is
guaranteed
receipt
of
the
inventory
notice
and
is
not
subjected
to
the
arbitrariness
or
to
the
discretionary
activity
that
could
go
into
effect
otherwise.
i
submit
that
if
a
innocent
man
with
a
subject
of
an
investigation,
he
would
preferred
to
know
this
even
though
his
exonerated
rather
than
have
the
entire
process
kept
secret
throughout
and
only
in
the
hands
and
only
in
the
files
of
the
government.
i
would
say
further
that
recognizing
the
existence
of
chavez
and
comparing
it
to
the
doctrine
of
giordano;
we
certainly
have
a
situation
with
the
identification
issue
which
is
closer
to
suppression
than
the
chavez
situation.
i
would
even
submit
to
this
honorable
court
that
the
identification
issue
is
as
key
and
as
central
as
the
giordano
issue,
because
here
we
are
dealing
with
the
situation
that
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
probable
cause
aspects
of
these
applications.
here
we
are
getting
again
to
the
heart
of
what
berger,
katz
and
congress
had
sought
in
the
form
of
judicial
review,
judicial
restraint.
ms.
carmen
a.
policy
without
addressing
myself
to
whether
not
it
is
a
constitutional
requirement,
i
submit
that
the
statute
in
question
your
honor
has
been
based
upon
the
rulings
of
berger
and
katz
and
i
am
submitting
that
the
reference
in
berger
that
was
made
by
mr.
frey
at
page
59
relating
to
naming
of
a
person
as
being
the
requirement
was
a
reference
that
the
government
in
effect
for
the
state
of
new
york
was
attempting
to
say,
look
we
have
a
naming
requirement
that
should
be
enough
to
save
the
statute.
i
think
it
was
the
state
of
new
york?s
opinion
at
that
point
and
effort
at
that
point
to
say,
this
is
such
an
important
key
issue,
this
naming
requirement,
it
is
there,
the
statute
should
survive,
whereas
i
believe
this
honorable
court
indicated
that
that
was
not
in
and
of
itself
enough.
ms.
carmen
a.
policy
i
would
submit
that
as
a
secondary
argument
it
would
be
a
constitutionally
required
rule
to
have
a
man,
who
the
government
knows
in
advance
will
be
searched,
whose
conversations
will
be
seized,
named
in
an
application
for
a
warrant
for
a
wiretap
and
at
the
failure,
the
failure
to
go
so
far
as
to
simply
name
this
individual
and
provide
the
aspects
of
probable
cause
to
the
judicial
officer,
who
would
review
the
same,
would
be
actually
a
violation
of
constitutional
standards
as
well
as
a
violation
of
the
statutory
standard.
ms.
carmen
a.
policy
your
honor
as
i
recall
the
kahn
language,
i
felt
that
kahn
was
saying
and
did
say
that
the
requirement
was
statutory
or
the
fact
that
she
was
not
known,
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
know
that
she
was
committing
these
offenses.
therefore,
a
statutory
violation
did
not
come
into
effect
and
i
believe
that
this
covered
the
constitutional
aspect
and
did
not
allow
it
to
come
into
play.
i
would
submit
that
in
kahn
again,
had
the
government
known
of
mrs.
kahn?s
identity
and
the
fact
that
she
engaged
in
this
illegal
activity,
statutory
and
constitutional
consideration
would
have
come
into
play.
thank
you
very
much
