mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
colleague
mr.
policy
and
i
represent
five
defendants
in
the
gambling
indictment
whose
telephone
conversations
were
intercepted
by
the
government
for
use
as
evidence
at
their
trial.
the
district
courts
suppressed
these
intercepts
because
they
were
obtained
in
violation
of
title
iii
of
the
omnibus
crime
control
act
of
1968.
my
clients
mr.
merlo
and
mr.
lauer,
because
they
never
received
inventory
notice
of
the
intercepts
as
required
by
18
united
state
code
section
2518
(8)(d)
which
i
shall
refer
to
as
8(d)
of
the
act
and
mr.
policy?s
clients
because
they
were
not
identified
in
the
application
for
authorization,
for
the
tap
even
though
they
were
known
to
the
government
as
required
by
18
united
states
code
section
1218
(1)(b)(4)
which
if
i
have
occasion
to
refer
it
to
again
will
be
as
1(b)4.
both
of
these
suppressions
were
affirmed
by
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
i
intent
to
urge
in
my
portion
of
the
argument
that
the
suppression
of
the
wiretap
evidence
against
my
clients
was
appropriate,
proper
and
necessary
because
of
the
government?s
violation
of
title
iii
8(d)
and
after
that
my
colleague
will
argue
for
affirmnace
of
the
suppression
as
to
his
clients
because
of
the
government?s
of
the
title
iii
violation
of
1(b)4.
it
seems
to
me,
that
at
the
outset
it
is
important
to
identify
a
couple
of
facts
which
have
become
a
obscured
or
muddied
as
a
result
of
the
briefs
and
the
descending
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
below.
one
of
the
things
that
i
think
must
be
clarified
is
that
there
never
was
any
actual
notice
to
defendants
merlo
and
lauer.
the
trial
court
have
heard
the
evidence
and
had
an
opportunity
to
observe
the
demeanor
of
the
witnesses
made
a
specific
finding
that
no
inventory
notice
was
ever
served
upon
merlo
and
lauer
nor
did
they
receive
notice
in
any
other
way
and
that
finding
by
the
trail
court
was
commented
upon
by
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
majority
opinion
of
the
view
that
the
fact
that
37
other
people
were
notified
would
at
least
give
the
defendants
a
feeling
that
they
had
not
been
intercepted
because
they
had
failed
to
receive
any
inventory
notice
as
required
by
section
8
(d).
so
there
is
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
it
is
clear
that
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
only
a
technical
violation,
the
failure
to
serve
an
inventory
notice
occurred
in
the
record
but
in
fact
up
until
the
time
they
were
indicted
some
11
months
later
and
until
they
actually
received
the
information
as
a
result
of
their
discovery
applications
they
had
no
such
actual
notice.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
the
court
of
appeals,
with
respect
to
the
majority,
did
not
take
such
a
position.
i
am
sorry,
the
majority
opinion
did
comment
on
the
finding
my
trial
court
that
they
have
not
received
the
actual
notice
and
further
speculated
in
their
opinion
that
far
from
the
suggestion
that
because
37
other
people
had
been
notified,
somehow
by
word
of
mouth,
they
must
have
had
actual
notice
in
someway
of
the
interception,
said
that
it
is
ambiguous
and
that
it
is
just
as
likely
that
because
the
others
had
received
the
actual
notice
and
they
had
not
that
they
were
entitled
to
assume
that
they
were
not
intercepted.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
i
think
they
were
just
refuting
an
argument
that
had
been
made
by
the
government
that
somehow
or
rather
through
the
grapevine
or
whatever
they
must
have
received
notice
because
37
other
people
had
received
inventory
notices.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
that
is
the
argument
that
was
being
refuted
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
the
government?s
argument
that
is
what
the
government
argued
and
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
the
finding
by
the
trial
court
that
there
was
in
fact
no
actual
notice
in
this
case
was
sound
and
that
is
the
basis
upon
which
they
did
so.
the
second
fact
that
i
think
needs
to
be
dealt
with.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
no,
i
am
going
beyond
that.
it
is
clear.
there
is
no
question
whatever
your
honor
that
no
inventory
notice
was
ever
served
upon
these
people,
never.
the
first
information
that
they
received
came
in
the
process
after
they
were
indicted
and
after
discovery
proceedings
were
instituted.
the
question
that
was
on
the
table
so
to
speak
so
far
as
the
court
of
appeals
was
concerned
and
the
trail
court
was
whether
not
conceiving
that
they
had
received
no
inventory
notice
as
required
by
the
statue,
whether
they
had
received
actual
notice
that
might
somehow
serve
to
medicate
the
violation
of
the
statue
and
in
dealing
with
that
problem?
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
or
colleagues
and
that
problem
was
what
the
court
was
addressing
when
they
concluded
that
no
actual
notice
had
been
shown
on
this
record,
neither
and
inventory
notice.
the
second
fact
that
i
believe
needs
to
be
dealt
with
is
the
question
of
when
it
was
that
mr.
merlo
and
mr.
lauer?s
identity
were
known
to
the
government
sufficient
to
cause
them
to
be
required
to
serve
an
inventory
notice
upon
these
particular
defendants.
and
i
believe
in
the
descending
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
judge
indicated
that
somehow
or
rather
that
information
did
not
come
until
august,
about
two
months,
two
or
three
months
prior
to
the
time
that
the
second
inventory
adding
a
couple
of
more
people
was
actually
filed.
i
believe
that,
that
represents
a
misreading
of
the
record
with
all
due
respect.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
that
does
appear,
mr.
gail,
a
special
agent
for
the
fbi
did
so
testify
and
in
the
next
few
lines
it
becomes
abundantly
clear
the
reason
that
he,
the
question
was
put
as
to
when
he
became
cognizant
of
fact
that
these
people
were
identified
not
only
as
individuals
who
had
been
on
the
telephone,
but
also
individuals
who
were
perhaps
involved
in
the
crime
that
they
were
investigating.
the
reason
that
he
became
aware
of
that
in
august
of
1973
was
because
of
the
fact
that
he
had
just
been
assigned
that
case
at
that
time
and
he
conceded
in
the
next
couple
of
pages
and
this
appears
at
approximately
160
to
165
in
the
appendix,
he
conceded
that
in
fact
by
january
13,
a
physical
search
and
seizure
was
made
of
the
premises
on
which
mr.
lauer
and
mr.
merlo
were
found,
that
is
a
part
of
the
problem
cause
that
was
assigned
in
that
affidavit
support
of
that
warrant.
the
telephone
information
which
had
been
optioned
was
employed.
that
at
time
physical
evidence
was
seized
which
was
going
to
be
introduced
and
some
very
critical
admissions
were
obtained
from
mr.
merlo
and
lauer
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
they
were
the
people
who
were
on
the
telephone
and
that
they
were
the
people
who
had
rented
the
telephone
in
another
name
and
he
conceded
i
think
quite
honestly
that
as
of
that
time
and
certainly
by
the
18th
of
january,
all
of
the
reports
of
the
raid,
all
of
the
evidence
seized,
all
of
the
reports
of
the
admissions
of
these
people
were
in
the
hands
of
the
responsible
people
in
the
government,
particularly
fbi
agents
who
were
working
with
the
strike
force.
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
way
to
read
this
record
except
to
find
that
at
least
by
january
18,
the
government
had
full
knowledge
of
the
identity
and
participation
of
these
two
individuals
and
yet
from
then
until
december,
from
january
to
december
and
after
the
time
of
indictment
these
people
were
never
served
with
inventory
notice,
nor
received
notice
of
any
kind
and
that
is
what
the
record
suggests.
and
so
i
think
that
when
the
court
in
the
sixth
circuit,
the
dissenting
judge
found
that
there
was
no
knowledge
until
august.
i
think
he
was
bringing
the
rest
of
the
record
and
i
think
it
is
very
clear
and
i
think
mr.
gail
makes
clear
that
the
reason
that
he
just
learned
the
part
was
because
he
was
a
young
lawyer
who
had
just
been
assigned
to
the
case
and
that
the
government
did
have
this
information.
in
addition
to
that,
there
was
some
talk
about
the
inadvertence
of
the
failure
to
serve
inventory
notice
upon
mr.
merlo
and
mr.
lauer
and
i
think
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
the
failure
to
do
so
was
inadvertent.
one
of
the
difficulties
of
attempting
to
find
out
from
the
government
so
far
as
the
defendant?s
standpoint
is
concerned
as
to
the
reasons
for
what
occurred
is
of
course
that
all
of
the
facts
are
within
the
control
of
the
government.
what
we
know
from
the
record
is
to
that
from
january
13th
or
january
18th
of
1973
until
december
there
was
never
any
notice.
that
when
they
combed
the
record
in
september
1973
to
find
other
people,
they
found
the
couple
of
other
people,
but
did
not
identify
merlo
and
laure
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
best
place
that
can
be
put
upon
is
record,
is
to
suggest
that
as
a
result
of
sloppiness,
as
a
result
of
negligence
of
the
government
these
two
people
were
not
identified,
that
is
the
best
the
pace
can
be
put
on
it.
it
seems
to
me
under
those
circumstances
to
allow
an
absolute
and
total
failure
to
perform
the
duties
that
are
required
under
the
8(d)
the
statute,
puts
a
burden
upon
the
defendants
in
terms
of
finding
out
why
it
was
that
it
was
not
done
which
i
think
congress
never
intended
with
the
strict
responsibilities
that
are
necessary
in
implementing
the
limitation
provisions
of
the
act.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
cannot
say
that
there
was
bad
faith.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
certainly
was
a
complete
and
total
failure
which
is
unexplained
by
the
government
and
which
i
think
must
be
explained
on
the
basis
of
at
least
negligence
or
sloppy
performance.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
that
is
one
of
the
branches
of
our
position,
your
honor.
the
other
branch
would
be
to
say
that
we
read
giordano
and
chavez
correctly
that
if
we
are
dealing
with
a
central
issue
or
central
subject
of
the
act
which
was
designed
to
limit
the
inappropriate
use
of
interception
of
communications
as
we
think
that
this
clearly
is
that
under
that
case
as
explained
by
chavez
whether
or
not
the
government
has
been
guilty
of
any
wrong
doing
either
negligent
or
deliberate
that
because
of
its
internality
and
because
of
the
importance
involved
in
making
sure
that
the
government
follows
in
strict
way
every
limitation
that
has
been
put
upon
them
by
the
statute
that
regardless
of
any
wrong
doing
or
negligence
by
the
government
that
suppression
would
be
appropriate
in
necessary
remedy.
so
our
positions
are
two
(inaudible)
in
that
direction.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
quite
clear
if
we
analyze
the
statute
itself
and
if
we
analyze
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
that
because
of
the
necessity
of
surreptitious
entry
or
surreptitious
search
and
seizure
as
that
term
is
applied
to
wire
that,
it
is
impossible
to
give
the
advance
notice
that
the
invasion
of
the
client?s
privacy
or
the
invasion
of
the
defendants?
privacy
is
involved.
as
a
consequence,
the
postintercept
procedures
have
been
clearly
set
out
to
make
sure
that
ultimately
disclosure
of
these
secret
intrusions
is
made
and
to
be
made
in
a
reasonable
time
thereafter,
not
immediately
necessarily,
but
at
a
reasonable
time
thereafter.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
government?s
discussion
of
the
whole
problem
of
suppression
there
was
no
mention
at
all
of
section
2515
which
very
clearly
indicates
that
suppression
is
appropriate,
when
there
has
been
a
violation
of
this
chapter.
it
seems
to
me
that,
that
and
the
legislative
history
surrounding
that
which
is
reported
in
detail
in
the
gilbert
decision
makes
quite
clear
that
is
was
important,
so
far
as
the
government
was
concerned,
so
far
as
congress
was
concerned,
to
make
sure
that
a
number
of
remedies
were
available
in
the
event
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
limitations
of
the
act.
criminal
provisions
were
provided
in
2511,
a
civil
suit
was
provided
in
2520
and
if
you
review
the
legislative
history
it
makes
clear
that,
that
coupled
with
the
requirement
that
the
government
not
be
able
to
use
the
fruits
of
it
violations
makes
it
very
clear
that,
that
was
the
intent
of
congress.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
words
if
known
in
the
statute
indicate
either
that
the
individual
is
known
and
was
intercepted
or
that
he
is
known
to
be
involved
in
the
criminal
activity.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
and
so
the
studies?
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well?
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
persons
who
are
overheard,
but
not
known?
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
come
within
another
section
of
8(d)
rather
than
the
one
to
which
the
court
is
referring.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
statute
says
in
8(d),
is
that
anybody
who
is
overheard
and
known
he
is
got
to
receive
an
inventory.
anybody
who
is
overheard
and
not
known
must
have
that
information
at
least
transmitted
to
the
court
so
it
can
exercise
its
discretion
in
the
interest
of
justice
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
to
require
an
inventory
and
the
failure
in
the
case,
your
honor,
is
that
there
was
no
such
information
transmitted
to
the
court,
so
that
the
court
could
exercise
its
discretion
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
persons
who
were
overheard,
but
not
known
which
is
a
category
into
which
my
clients
fall,
whether
or
not
those
persons
should
have
been
issued
an
inventory
notice
in
the
interest
of
justice.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
we
think
that
they
were
known
as
early
as
january?
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
your
honor.
we
think
that
these
people
were
known
at
least
by
january
1973.
we
are
not
making
the
contention
that
they
were
known
at
the
time
of
the
application
for
an
authorization
for
the
inception,
but
we
do
claim
that
since
january
of
1973
until
the
time
that
they
actually
discovered
the
information,
after
they
were
inedited,
they
were
entitled
to
that
inventory
information
and
that
they
never
received
it,
that
is
our
position.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
would
like
to
just
make
one
other
observation
and
that
is
this.
that
with
respect
to
this
exclusionary,
well,
getting
back
to
mr.
justice
stevens?
question,
getting
back
to
the
exclusionary
rule,
although
there
are
specific
provisions
in
2518(a)
8(a)
regarding
sealing
which
do
express
an
exclusionary
rule
and
2518
9
to
send
a
notice
provision,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
quite
clear
the
2515
provides
the
exclusionary
rule
on
a
statutory
basis
for
all
of
the
other
violations
of
the
chapter
and
further
more
with
respect
to
2518
9,
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
congress
when
it
required
a
showing
of
prejudice
was
able
to
draft
such
language
and
use
it
into
2518
9.
the
balance
on
my
time
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
colleague
to
argue
the
question
under
1(b)4.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
