unknown
speaker
it
was
the
kahn
household
telephone.
unknown
speaker
you
agreed,
did
you
not
in
your
brief
that
if
somebody
regularly
uses
the
phone,
they
should
be
named
too?
unknown
speaker
you
putting
it
not
on
to
the
person,
but
the
instrument
owner?
unknown
speaker
mr.
counselor,
you
talk
about
everybody
in
the
world.
there
is
no
claim
yet
to
name
everybody,
it
is
only
those
who
are
believed
to
be
committing
the
offense?
unknown
speaker
be
limited
to
those
if
the
government
has
reason
to
believe
are
committing
the
offense.
unknown
speaker
let
me
make
it
specific.
supposing
in
the
kahn
case
the
government
had
known
which
they
did
not,
in
advance
that
minnie
kahn
was
a
partner
in
the
gambling
venture.
you
say
she
would
not
have
been
named?
unknown
speaker
just
so
i
understand
why
would
you
concede
that?
unknown
speaker
by
her
telephone,
you
mean
she
was
a
regular
user
of
the
phone
and
it
was
not
listed
in
her
name.
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand,
why
you
concede
she
would
be
properly
named?
is
it
because
she
lived
there
or
she
was
a
regular
user
of
the
phone?
unknown
speaker
now,
what
does
the
statute
talk
about
from
the
phone?
that
is
what
you
seem
to
emphasize
which
instrument
is
used?
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
just
conceded
that
it
can
be
two
persons.
unknown
speaker
i
am
trying
to
understand
what
you
have
think
the
statute
it
means,
and
i
think
you
have
conceded
that
the
singular
aspect
of
it
is
really
not
controlling.
unknown
speaker
the
inventory
provision
says
persons
with
s,
2518
(8)
(d),
the
inventory
provision
to
the
persons
names?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
let
me
just
to
ask
why
do
you
suppose
congress
put
in
any
naming
requirement?
unknown
speaker
but
the
point
is,
they
want
to
identify
the
person
whose
constitutionally
protected
privacy
is
to
be
invaded
and
you
are
saying
that
the
owner
of
the
phone
has
such
a
privacy
interest,
but
the
other
person
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
has
no
such
privacy.
unknown
speaker
what
i
am
trying
to
understand
is
why
does
the
reason
apply
to
one
and
not
to
the
other,
that
is
the
heart
of
my
question,
i
guess?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
let
me
ask
you
one
question.
do
you
have
any
doubt
that
congress
could
have
drafted
a
statute
that
provided
only
for
the
naming
upon
a
showing
probable
cause
of
the
owner
of
the
phone
in
the
united
states
against
white?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
that,
that
your
clients
would
know
that
37
other
people
had
been
intercepted,
but
that
they
would
have
received
no
notices
themselves,
so
they
would
assume
they
have
not
been
intercepted?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
the
courts
of
appeals
think
that
they
have
learned
of
the
receipt
actual
notice
by
the
other
37
people?
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
just
as
reasonable
that
they
received
that
kind
of
notice
by
the
grapevine
they
received
notice
the
fact
they
have
been
overheard?
unknown
speaker
actual
notice,
now
you
mean
the
formal
notice
contemplated
by
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
that
is
from
one
of
their
friends.
unknown
speaker
was
it
not
what
the
testimony
was,
the
time
was
placed
as
the
late
summer
of
1973,
perhaps
late
august?
unknown
speaker
you
have
not
taken
the
position
that
there
was
bad
faith
demonstrated
by
this
record
then
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
if
you
were
to
say
that
if
there
was
negligence
then
it
should
follow
that
suppression
is
an
order?
unknown
speaker
mr.
berkman,
how
do
you
meet
the
government?s
argument
that
the
references
to
postinterception
conduct,
there
are
a
couple
of
specific
references,
but
they
do
not
apply
to
the
situation?
unknown
speaker
mr.
berkman,
can
i
ask
you
one
point?
as
i
understand
your
argument
that
the
government
does
what
it
did
in
this
case
and
they
overhear
the
testimony
of
an
unknown
criminal,
he
can
be
prosecuted
on
the
basis
of
that
information,
but
if
they
overhear
the
conversation
of
a
known
criminal
they
cannot
use
it.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
said,
well,
if
he
is
not
known
and
he
is
very
clever
man
then
you
can
use
it.
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
is
stupid
and
he
is
known
you
cannot
use
it.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
that
is
what
you
said?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
you
admit
that
they
were
unknown,
did
your
clients
were
unknown?
unknown
speaker
at
first
you
said
they
were?
unknown
speaker
went
about
five
minutes
explaining
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
berkman,
your
time
is
running
short.
you
have
not
covered
all
your?
unknown
speaker
mr.
policy.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
refer
to
berger
and
katz.
those
are
constitutional
cases.
you
do
not
have
any
doubt
from
reading
that
footnote
15
in
kahn,
do
you
that,
what
you
are
saying
is
that
statute
requirement
is
not
a
constitutional
requirement.
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
arguing
that
this
is
a
constitutionally
required
rule
that
you
are
contending
for
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
not
you
think
that
kahn
language
is
quite
to
the
contrary?
unknown
speaker
doesn?t
the
distinction
tend
to
disappear
as
the
second
person?s
use
of
the
phone
becomes
more
and
more
regular
and
frequent?
unknown
speaker
or
a
case
where
you
trying
prove
the
five-man
crime
and
you
know
all
five
people
used
the
same
phone
over
and
over
again.
even
there
you
would
not
say
they
had
to
name
more
than
one.
unknown
speaker
but
on
the
reverse
side
of
that
as
soon
as
you
do
have
probable
cause
then
you
should
name
him,
should
you
not,
under
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
after
the
phone,
the
tap
is
on
and
then
some
calls
are
coming
in.
as
soon
as
it
appears
that
this
man
is
calling
saying
whose
going
to
win
the
third
race
tomorrow
afternoon
because
it
is
all
fixed
and
you
get
repeated
calls,
have
you
not
then
probable
cause
to
believe
that
person?
unknown
speaker
you
cannot
name
them
because
you
may
not
know
the
name;
take
some
steps
to
identify
them
under?
unknown
speaker
if
you
would
then
go
ahead
and
indict
him?
