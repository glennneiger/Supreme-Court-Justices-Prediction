justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
connecticut
that
excluded
the
expenses
of
the
child
birth
either
under
the
statute
or
constitutionally?
justice
byron
r.
white
including
paying
for
child
birth?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
is
that
a
separate
question
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
jurisdictional
statement
didn’t
lay
that
in
two
separate
way
as
to
whether
independently
the
necessity
to
certify
in
detail
constitutionally?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you
mrs.
katz?
suppose
in
the
case
that
the
like
before
we
were
to
construe
the
federal
statute
as
the
second
circuit
did
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
then,
i
take
it
then
that
connecticut
if
it
wanted
to
could
pay
for
elective
abortion
and
it
wouldn’t
cost
them
any
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
what.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
much?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
50%
and
so
but
their
physical
interest
then
is
limited
to
that
50%?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
compared
with
carrying
the
birth
to
term
which
they
pay
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
--
if
the
second
circuit
is
correct
in
the
way
it
construes
the
statute,
connecticut
could
pick
and
choose
among
the
“necessary”
services
that
(inaudible),
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
may
be
so,
that
maybe
so,
but
you
would
say
that
it
would
have
to
choose
to
plan
the
abortions
because
of
the
impact
that
they
can
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
then
the
statute
would
permit
that?
because
the
statute
would
permit
it,
it
wouldn’t
mean
that
it
would
require
therefore
to
pay
for
cosmetic
surgery?
