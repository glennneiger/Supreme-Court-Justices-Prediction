justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
the
case
that
i've
just
announced,
the
bill
against
doe,
we
held
that
the
social
security
act
does
not
require
the
funding
of
non-therapeutic
abortions.
this
case,
maher
against
roe,
presents
a
constitutional
question,
whether
a
state
medicare
program
validly
may
deny
funding
for
such
abortions
while
providing
it
for
childbirth.
a
connecticut
regulation
limits
medicare
benefits
for
first
trimester
abortions
to
those
that
are
medically
necessary,
a
term
defined
to
include
psychiatric
necessity
but
not
elective
abortions.
respondents
in
this
case,
two
indigent
women
unable
to
obtain
a
physician's
certificate
of
medical
necessity
challenged
the
regulation.
relying
on
our
1973
decisions
in
roe
v.
wade
and
doe
v.
bolton,
a
three-judge
district
court
held
that
the
regulation
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
and
we
now
reverse.
our
cases
recognize
a
basic
distinction
between
direct
state
interference
with
a
protected
activity
and
state
encouragement
of
an
alternative
activity
consonant
with
legislative
policy.
unlike
the
laws
invalidated
in
our
previous
abortion
decisions,
the
connecticut
regulation
does
not
interfere
with
the
protected
right
to
choose
abortion.
the
pregnant
woman
remains
free
of
legal
restraints,
nor
does
a
regulation
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
we
have
noted
in
prior
decisions
that
a
state
has
a
strong
and
legitimate
interest
in
normal
childbirth.
connecticut,
as
a
matter
of
policy
and
in
furtherance
of
this
issue,
has
chosen
to
fund
childbirth
expenses
but
not
those
of
non-therapeutic
abortions.
we
cannot
say
that
the
constitution
forbids
a
state
to
make
this
policy
a
choice.
it
is
important
to
understand
the
nature
and
scope
of
our
decisions.
we
do
not
hold
that
the
funding
of
such
abortions
is
unlawful.
congress
is
quite
free
to
require
provision
about
medicare
benefits
for
abortions
as
a
condition
of
state
participation
in
the
medicare
program.
also,
under
the
social
security
act,
as
we
have
construed
it
today
in
the
bill
against
doe,
connecticut
is
equally
free
to
provide
such
benefits.
we
hold
only
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
a
judicially
imposed
resolution
of
this
issue.
it
is
an
issue
involving
the
weighing
of
important
public
interest,
the
type
of
issue
that
under
our
constitution
should
be
resolved
by
representatives
of
the
people
rather
than
by
federal
judges.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
have
joined.
mr.
justice
marshall
also
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
likewise
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
joined.
