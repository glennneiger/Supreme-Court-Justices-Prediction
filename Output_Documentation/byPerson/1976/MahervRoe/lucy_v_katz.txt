ms.
lucy
v.
katz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
court.
i
represent
the
plaintiffs,
appellees
in
this
action.
this
argument
is
being
held
today
because
the
state
of
connecticut
denies
medicaid
assistance
to
women
who
choose
to
terminate
their
pregnancies
by
abortion,
while
at
the
same
time,
it
provides
payment
for
any
and
all
forms
of
obstetrical
care
involved
in
the
birth
of
a
child.
we
have
a
basic
factual
dispute
with
the
state's
assertion
that
this
is
simply
a
requirement
that
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
entire
medicaid
program
and
throughout
my
argument
i
will
refer
to
the
reasons
for
that
dispute.
we
also
disagree
with
his
assertion
that
connecticut
has
a
more
liberal
policy
than
this
court
heard
about
in
pennsylvania.
there
is
no
requirement
in
pennsylvania
that
i
know
about
that
a
doctor
must
especially
certify
that
an
abortion
is
necessary
for
the
health
of
the
patient
nor
is
there
a
requirement
in
that
state
that
the
state
give
prior
authorization
for
every
abortion
under
medicaid.
the
state
in
connecticut
is
denying
this
assistance
in
a
way
which
is
directly
contrary
to
this
court’s
recognition
that
a
woman
has
a
fundamental
right
with
her
physician
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
bear
a
child.
and
as
i
would
show,
the
regulation’s
main
thrust
is
to
impose
upon
poor
women,
the
moral
and
religious
opinions
of
various
state
officials.
connecticut
has
asserted
no
state
interest
whatsoever
which
justifies
this
manipulation
of
a
public
benefit
program
in
favor
of
child
birth
and
against
abortion.
i
would
like
to
preface
my
replies
to
the
attorney
general
by
invoking
the
framework
used
by
this
court
in
considering
the
landmark
case
of
roe
against
wade.
that
framework.
now
that
there
are
two
facets
to
any
consideration
of
state
action
regarding
abortion;
one
is
our
awareness
of
the
very
deep
moral
and
religious
and
philosophical
objections
which
many
persons
hold
regarding
abortion.
the
other
facet,
however,
is
that
in
resolving
these
questions,
we
must
be
guided
by
the
constitution
and
we
must
make
an
effort
to
free
ourselves
of
the
emotions
and
prejudices
of
the
past
and
the
state
in
particular
is
obligated
to
act
free
of
such
prejudices.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
i
see
this
case
is
rather
heavily
a
due
process
case
because
of
the
fundamental
right
asserted
and
as
well
an
equal
protection
case
and
the
class
under
the
equal
protection
standard
is
made
up
of
persons
who
are
asserting
their
fundamental
right
to
make
the
abortion
choice.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
if
i
could
talk
to
that,
i
thought
your
first
question
was
that
if
it
did
not
pay
for
birth
at
all,
yes.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
then
i
believe
it
--
if
the
state
provided
no
benefits
for
child
or
whatsoever,
then
the
case
was
certainly
be
very
different
in
due
process
terms
but
--
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
that
may
well
be
a
due
process
case
and
in
fact,
i
conceive
of
the
right
to
welfare
benefits
for
maternity
care
as
a
due
process
question.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
absolutely
not
and
we
are
not
asserting
here
that
the
state
has
an
obligation
to
pay
for
an
abortion
for
indigent
women.
well
we
--
just
as
in
shapiro
versus
thompson
where
the
right
to
travel
was
the
question,
no
one
suggested
that
the
state
had
to
in
fact
buy
a
bus
ticket
for
an
indigent
person.
we
are
relying
on
the
fact
that
when
the
state
provides
a
comprehensive
program
for
obstetrical
care,
then
it
must
provide
for
abortion.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
i
think
it’s
both
your
honor
and
--
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
the
right
to
choose
determinative
pregnancy
is
the
right
of
personal
privacy
and
personal
liberty
which
is
incorporating
the
concept
of
liberty
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
may
not
be
deprived
without
due
process
of
law.
by
the
same
token,
a
classification
cannot
be
created
which
imposes
a
deprivation
of
that
sort
of
liberty
and
the
questions
under
the
equal
protection
test
then
becomes
--
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
i
don’t
believe
it
could
have.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
i
don’t
believe
it
does.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
the
due
process
argument
i
make
is
not
--
is
a
little
bit
different.
i’m
making
the
argument
under
due
process
the
state
cannot
condition
the
choice
towards
child
birth,
that
it
cannot
intrude
into
the
decision
making
process
and
that
is
what
connecticut
is
doing.
whether
the
state
has
to
provide
medical
services
for
pregnancy
may
include
due
process
question
about
just
what
the
state
is
obligated
to
provide
under
system
of
medical
benefits
to
the
poor,
but
i
believe
that’s
a
different
question
which
would
not
be
resolved
by
the
court’s
decision
in
this
case.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
yes,
it
would.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
it
might
be
a
due
process
argument
in
terms
of
the
kind
of
judgment
the
state
is
making
in
this
protective
area.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
it
might
and
that
would
raise
different
kinds
of
questions.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
well,
the
state’s
interest
would
be
different.
the
kind
of
program
we’re
discussing
would
be
different
and
the
kinds
of
impact
upon
the
women’s
choice
would
be
different.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
what
the
state
does
all
the
time
in
the
educational
process
is
certainly
to
assert
its
moral
views.
what
i’m
saying
is
this
is
such
a
direct
and
immediate
impingement
that
it
is
evoked
somewhat
different
considerations.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
that’s
true
mr.
--
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
i
don’t
believe
it’s
exactly
the
same
mr.
justice
stewart
because
the
--
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
well
as
i
see
it
--
the
opportunity
for
the
jury
trial
is
absolutely
afforded
to
the
defendant
and
--
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
that’s
correct.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
yes
--
in
the
case,
we
are
discussing
there
is
virtually
and
absolute
prohibition
on
the
opportunity
of
the
woman
to
have
the
service
and
there
is
similar
prohibition.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
yes.
mr.
justice
stewart,
only
indigent
woman.
but
in
fact
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
its
remarks
in
the
singleton
versus
wulff
case,
in
this
context
that
impact
on
an
indigent
woman
is
virtually
identical
to
the
criminal
penalty
at
issue
and
by
the
same
token
mr.
justice
stewart,
a
woman
receiving
pubic
assistance
in
the
state
of
connecticut
has
an
obligation
in
some
cases
to
repay
that
assistance,
but
i
don’t
think
that
justifies
denial
of
assistance
to
one
who
asserts
a
substantial
federal
right.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
yes
sir.
i
would
like
to
make
it
clear
just
as
at
start
that
there
has
been
no
question
that
a
class
of
abortions
which
are
clearly
within
the
protection
of
roe
against
wade
is
available
to
medicaid
eligible
women
and
that
this
includes
a
large
majority
of
abortions
which
are
in
fact
chosen
for
economic
reasons
or
for
social
or
educational
reasons
or
for
other
family
demands.
and
that
under
the
prior
authorization
requirement,
the
physician
must
state
that
the
abortion
is
medically
necessary
for
the
patient’s
health
and
he
must
state
the
specific
reasons
for
the
medical
necessity.
and
he
must
demonstrate
that
the
patient
has
consented
in
advance.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
yes,
it
is
a
separate
question
mr.
justice
white.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
i
believe
the
question
--
the
prior
authorization
and
certification
necessity
is
part
and
parcel
of
--
is
the
medical
necessity
requirement
because
that
requirement
is
not
imposed
in
any
other
way.
this
is
the
difference
i
believe
between
pennsylvania
and
connecticut’s
policy.
this
is
not
something
that
the
department
has
stated
that
it
was
in
its
mind
but
the
department
has
directly
asked
the
physician
to
certify
in
advance
of
treatment.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
absolutely
not
mr.
justice
marshall.
this
is
the
only
service
--
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
could
it?
perhaps
it
could.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
if
every
service
had
to
have
a
certificate
of
medical
necessity?
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
any
statement
that
an
abortion
must
be
medically
necessary
for
the
health
of
the
patient
i
would
have
a
complaint
in
that.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
i
don’t
believe
it
would
because
--
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
because
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
of
an
unnecessary
abortion
unless
the
woman
is
not
pregnant.
if
the
standard
were
applied
equally,
truly
equally
to
all
forms
of
pregnancy
care,
that
would
be
acceptable.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
i
understand
that.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
the
reason
i
would
object
to
that
is
that
any
suggestion
as
this
record
well
shows
that
an
abortion
must
be
medically
necessary,
works
to
me
to
be
exclude
abortions
which
are
necessary
for
the
end
desired
by
the
patient,
the
doctor
but
which
may
not.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
no.
that
is
my
answer.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
the
state
could
require
that
every
service
be
necessary.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
i’m
sorry
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
state
could
require
that
every
service
including
abortion
be
necessary.
it
is
the
--
that
is
required
under
dolgin's
bolton.
i
think
we
have
to
meet
that
to
be
acceptable.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
i
differentiate
between
medically
necessary
and
necessary.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
if
the
service
had
to
be
necessary,
only
that
where
necessary
in
the
judgment
of
the
doctor
that
would
be
valid.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
we
are
arguing
--
i
think
we
are
arguing
both
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
--
if
--
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
certainly.
we
have
a
situation
where
pregnancy
is
a
condition
which
virtually
every
court
has
held
to
require
some
form
of
medical
care.
if
we
are
truly
to
lay
aside
the
emotions
of
the
past,
then
abortion
and
full
term
delivery
become
equally
necessary
depending
on
the
choice
of
the
women
or
looked
at
another
way
either
service
is
unnecessary
because
the
other
could
have
been
chosen.
connecticut
in
fact
does
not
limit
obstetrical
care
to
necessary
services
in
this
sense
because
in
many
obstetrical
cases,
there
are
choices
which
maybe
harmful
to
the
health
of
the
patient,
but
connecticut
will
totally
support
the
decision
to
continue
the
pregnancy
and
bear
the
child
even
if
that
continuation
becomes
in
fact
life
threatening.
in
other
cases,
the
pregnancy
may
not
be
a
threat
to
the
health,
but
they
are
maybe
for
example
a
danger
of
miscarriage
yet
connecticut
supports
all
services
necessary
to
bring
about
birth
and
that
is
true
even
though
had
the
women
naturally
miscarried,
there
would
be
no
danger
to
her
health.
it
is
the
abortion
choice
here
that
is
eliminated
from
coverage.
though
as
with
all
the
above
procedures,
it
is
clearly
a
medical
procedure
necessary
to
the
treatment
of
the
condition
of
the
patient.
moreover
statements
to
the
contrary
not
withstanding
on
its
face,
the
regulation
requires
review
of
the
particular
abortion
by
persons
within
the
department
of
social
services.
it
is
said
that
they
must
review
the
application
and
make
a
decision
and
this
becomes
a
veto
of
the
abortion
decision
in
many
cases
which
this
court
most
recently
affirmed
its
objections
to.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
yes
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
believe
it
would
in
that
case.
abortion
i
might
to
stress
again
is
the
only
service
subject
to
the
statement
of
medical
necessity
and
i
base
that
on
answers
to
our
interrogatories
which
were
provided
by
the
defendants.
it
is
the
only
service
covered
by
medicaid
which
requires
that
consent
be
demonstrated
in
advance.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
i
think
that
there
would
be
definite
constitutional
objections
to
that
sort
of
program.
that
is
not
to
say
that
there
are
no
steps
the
state
can
take
which
encourage
or
discourage
population
growth
or
population
planning.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
that
would
again
be
a
program
which
was
weighting
the
choice.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
it
may
and
that
may
--
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
because
that
interest
is
not
rise
to
the
level
of
justification
for
an
infringement
in
this
area
under
this
court’s
prior
decisions.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
the
prior
decisions
roe
and
bolton
do
deal
with
preventing
the
choice,
but
the
decisions
on
pubic
benefit
programs
that
consider
this
sort
of
interference
go
directly
to
weighting
the
choice
and
there
maybe
a
different
balancing
process
when
the
state
asserts
and
demonstrates
an
interest
in
limiting
population
or
increasing
population.
that
is
the
way
that
it
is
asserted
is
different
from
the
issues
that
are
before
the
court
at
this
time.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
we
don’t
argue
that
we
have
to
prove
that
the
woman
was
totally
prohibited
from
making
one
choice
rather
than
the
other
under
maricopa
county,
under
shapiro
v.
thompson
in
past
cases,
a
penalty
is
sufficient.
i
think
that
--
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
except
that
under
shapiro
versus
thompson,
it
was
specifically
stated
that
that
is
the
same
as
a
penalty
and
under
memorial
hospital
it
was
stated
that
that
is
the
same
as
a
penalty.
that
it’s
enough
that
there
is
an
impingement
as
this
court
said
in
singleton,
an
interdiction
of
the
choice
of
the
abortion.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
yes
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
court
has
determined
although
that
a
woman
has
a
right
with
her
physician
to
choose
to
terminate
her
pregnancy
and
this
is
a
component
of
her
right
to
personal
privacy
and
it
is
a
fundamental
personal
right
which
is
implicit
in
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty
and
which
extents
to
matters
relating
to
marriage,
the
family,
procreation,
child
rearing
and
to
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
bear
a
child.
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
whenever
the
state
denies
an
important
government
benefit
to
a
person
who
asserts
such
a
fundamental
right,
it
is
violating
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
fundamental
right
is
may
be
operative
factor
in
the
determination
of
eligibility
for
this
benefit.
and
as
a
consequence,
there
as
i
have
stated,
there
is
a
substantial
penalty
imposed
upon
these
plaintiffs.
the
court
i
should
know
in
both
shapiro
and
in
memorial
hospital
took
into
account
the
nature
of
the
benefit
we
are
discussing
and
the
fact
that
this
is
the
only
way
indigent
women
can
get
medical
care.
well,
there
is
no
right
to
subsidies
of
medical
care
for
anyone
in
this
country.
that
does
not
mean
the
court
must
close
its
eyes
to
the
fact
that
this
is
a
crucial
benefit
to
recipients
thereof.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
it’s
optional.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
as
optional?
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
that
is
correct.
it
would
cost
them
their
share.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
it
would
still
cost
them
their
share
of
the
federal
program.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
50%.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
yes.
yes
sir.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
no
--
yes,
that’s
correct.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
yes
sir.
it’s
the
federal
government
for
all
medicaid
services.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
in
connecticut,
it's
all
50%.
there
are
certain
provisions
for
mainly
stating
the
cost.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
family
planning
is
90%.
administration,
i
believe
is
75%,
i
could
be
incorrect.
the
basic
physician
service
is
50%
for
all
cases.
the
state
when
it
is
creating
such
a
burden
or
penalty
upon
the
exercise
of
a
fundamental
right,
we
argue
is
obligated
to
show
a
compelling
interest
for
the
way
it
does
that
and
this
court
has
consistently
applied
this
test
to
cases
in
the
abortion
area
and
in
addition,
the
state
must
show
that
its
regulation
is
narrowly
drawn
to
accomplish
that
purpose.
connecticut
as
the
district
court
found
has
shown
no
interest
which
can
be
termed
compelling
or
which
even
meet
the
more
limited
rational
basis
test.
connecticut
in
fact
has
never
been
very
consistent
in
demonstrating
exactly
what
its
interest
is
when
the
litigation
first
began.
connecticut
asserted
that
the
only
reason
it
limited
the
payments
for
these
abortions
was
because
the
social
security
act
compelled
it
to
do
so
and
that
it
would
become
ineligible
for
its
matching
funds
if
it
paid
for
these
services.
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
indicated
that
that
was
not
so.
the
connecticut
have
the
option
under
the
federal
statute
to
provide
these
services
and
it
would
be
reimbursed
to
them
and
the
court
in
effect
urged
connecticut
therefore
to
drop
the
regulation
and
to
pay
for
the
services
for
which
plaintiffs
were
asking.
connecticut
chose
instead,
however,
to
continue
its
ban
on
payments
for
abortions
and
then
asserted
that
it
had
a
right
to
limit
its
program
to
necessary
services
and
that
it
had
a
strong
fiscal
interest.
the
fiscal
interest
as
noted
by
the
district
court
is
really
none
existent
in
that
case
because
it
was
in
the
record
in
fact
that
abortion
is
only
a
fraction
as
costly
as
normal
child
birth.
and
that
it
is
many
times
less
costly
than
any
complication
of
child
birth
such
as
the
cesarean
section.
moreover
by
definition,
the
newborn
child
with
its
mother
will
be
eligible
for
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
which
at
the
time
of
this
litigation
for
a
family
consisting
of
an
adult
and
a
child
was
$209.00
per
month
at
a
minimum,
not
including
eligibility
for
other
services
which
may
have
been
available.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
yes
mr.
justice
stevens,
but
that
is
logically
not
a
persuasive
argument
because
we
are
--
connecticut
would
not
in
fact
have
to
pay
for
a
whole
host
of
services.
we
are
arguing
that
abortion
is
a
necessary
service.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
nobody
in
the
entire
state?
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
perhaps
not
but
the
--
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
but
it
would
not
be
a
fundamental
right
in
this
area
of
privacy.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
it
is
simply
--
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
it
maybe
constitutionally
protected.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
well
i
think
that
maybe
correct
and
that
may
also
be
necessary
service
and
in
fact
is
paid
for
by
the
state
of
connecticut
in
those
circumstances.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
that
is
right
except
that
there
have
to
be
some
limitations
on
the
constitutionality
of
its
choices.
it
could
pick
and
choose
among
a
variety
of
services.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
yes
sir,
i
would.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
yes
sir.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
within
the
medicaid
program?
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
it
would
be
less
wrong.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
wrong.
i
said
it
would
be
equally
wrong,
yes
sir.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
because
there
is
--
this
country
does
not
annunciate
a
right
to
free
medical
care
for
all
forms
of
services.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
i
believe
that
once
a
woman
is
pregnant,
there
is
a
right
which
comes
into
play
which
does
not
come
into
play
for
a
person
whose
needing
that
care.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
no.
a
right
to
be
free
from
an
imposition
on
the
choice.
whereas
there
are
many
forms
of
medical
care
which
involve
choices,
both
by
the
patient
and
by
the
physician
and
there
is
no
right,
absolute
right
to
make
one
choice
or
the
other.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
i
believe
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
i
was
saying
the
opposite
that
there
is
no
right
to
free
medical
care
to
the
indigent.
connecticut
could
perhaps
have
no
program
of
medicaid
and
connecticut
could
perhaps
limit
its
program
to
life
threatening
procedures,
but
it
hasn’t
done
that.
it
has
a
very
comprehensive
program
which
pays
for
many
services
which
by
this
definition
are
not
for
the
necessary
and
in
the
context
in
to
that
program,
there
cannot
be
a
weighting
of
the
choice
of
the
pregnant
woman
one
way
or
the
other.
ms.
lucy
v.
katz
thank
you
very
much.
