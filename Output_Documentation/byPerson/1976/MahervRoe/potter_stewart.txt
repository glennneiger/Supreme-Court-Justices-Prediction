justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
there
are
provisions
to
detect
and
apply
sanctions
against
fraud
on
the
part
of
physicians
under
the
medicaid
program,
not
only
in
this
area,
but
through
out
the
program,
aren’t
there?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
can
understand
why
it
would
be,
but
that
program
would
be
applicable
here
as
well
as
applicable
in
other
parts
of
medicaid,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
found
the
physician
was
consistently
lying.
justice
potter
stewart
getting
public
funds
that
were
not
--
that
nobody
was
entitled
to?
justice
potter
stewart
so
to
that
extent,
i
suppose
his
certificate
is
subject
to
question,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
let's
say
if
a
physician
were
consistently
prescribing
drugs
that
were
not
needed,
not
medically
necessary
just
in
order
to
get
public
moneys
and
nobody
--
that
neither
he
nor
the
patient
were
entitled
to,
wouldn’t
he
be
subject
to
sanctions,
criminal
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
understand
the
district
court’s
judgment
to
have
been
based
upon
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
on
something
else
in
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
or
another
part
of
that
same
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
blumstien?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
a
little
bit
like
the
shapiro
case
in
this
court
which
is
also
i
think
involved
your
statement.
justice
potter
stewart
do
we
have
amicus
brief
in
this
case
from
hew?
we
have
one
one
the
case
that
was
just
argued.
justice
potter
stewart
we
do
not,
do
we?
justice
potter
stewart
i
want
to
be
sure
i
wasn’t
missing
anything.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
it
would
be
constitutionally
impermissible
for
part
of
the
motivation
of
the
state
of
connecticut
in
this
case
to
be
its
moral
objection?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let’s
assume
that
we
--
that
all
those
palace
(ph)
of
proof
had
been
surmounted
and
that
it
were
established
that
at
least
part
of
the
purpose
of
connecticut
in
denying
public
funds
for
abortion
on
demand
or
whatever
you
wish
to
call
it
were
moral,
would
that
make
connecticut’s
action
invalid
in
your
view?
you
concede
it
would
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
i’m
--
my
question
assumes
that
there
has
been
clear
and
convincing
proof
and
that
it
is
shown
--
has
been
shown
that
the
part
of
connecticut’s
reason
for
doing
this
is
it’s
moral
objection
to
abortion
on
demand.
do
you
concede
that
that
would
be
constitutionally
impermissible
[voice
overlap].
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
do
concede
that
if
it
were
the
sole
reason,
it
would
be
constitutionally
impermissible?
justice
potter
stewart
it
carries
out
the
same
program,
but
for
quite
a
different
reason?
justice
potter
stewart
or
presumably
representing
that
majority
to
populous
when
it
does
so?
justice
potter
stewart
or
if
you
can
analogize
this
i
suppose
to
a
jury
trial.
now,
there
is
a
constitutional
right
that
everybody,
every
criminal
defendant
has
to
a
jury
trial.
there
is
also
a
constitutional
right
not
to
have
a
jury
trial.
i
suppose
this
court
is
held
as
a
constitutional
right
if
a
woman
to
have
an
abortion
and
there
is
also
by
presume
a
constitutional
right
for
her
to
have
a
child.
but
a
state
can
certainly
take
the
view
that
it
would
absolutely
disrupt
its
criminal
justice
system
if
everybody
had
a
jury
trial,
just
as
couldn’t
state
legitimately
take
the
view
that
it
would
disrupt
its
--
the
public
policy,
the
welfare
of
a
state
if
nobody
ever
had
a
child,
if
every
pregnant
woman
had
an
abortion?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
legislature
could
take
that
moral
view,
could
it
not
legitimately?
justice
potter
stewart
well
except
that
the
district
court
did
find
that
that
was
one
of
motivating
reasons
for
the
connecticut
did
what
it
did,
so
it’s
here
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
unless
we
say
that
we
are
just
wrong
factually?
justice
potter
stewart
was
your
motion
granted?
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
an
equal
protection
case
in
your
view?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have,
everybody
has
a
right
to
publish
a
free
press,
but
that
doesn’t
impose
an
obligation
on
the
state
to
subsidize
your
free
press,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
motivation
of
the
state
would
be
precisely
the
same
as
what
you
say
the
motivation
of
the
state
was
here
to
exercise
the
influence
of
its
moral
views?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
take
my
jury
trial
case.
the
person
we
both
agree
has
an
absolute
constitutional
right
to
a
trial
jury
in
the
criminal
case
in
a
state
or
federal
court.
and
yet
isn’t
it
true
that
--
the
defenders
are
convicted
is
charged
with
the
costs
of
the
jury
whereas
if
he’d
waved
the
jury
trial,
it
would
not
have
been
charged
with
the
costs
of
the
judges’
time?
justice
potter
stewart
wasn’t
that
same
point
as
we
have
here?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
not
exactly
the
same
being
tried
in
the
criminal
case,
but
exactly
the
same
as
having
an
abortion,
but
isn’t
that
constitutionally
--?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
to
be
mean
but
you
got
to
have
to
pay
for
it
by
himself
in
many
states
if
he
is
convicted
he
is
to
work
it
off
in
prison?
justice
potter
stewart
whereas
if
he
exercises
his
equal
right
not
to
have
a
jury
trial.
he
doesn’t
have
to
pay
for
the
cost
of
the
trier
of
the
facts.
justice
potter
stewart
only
an
indigent
prohibition,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
is
--
you
do
not
suggest
this
in
part
my
brother
marshall’s
question
is
clear
that
any
woman
in
connecticut
does
continues
to
have
a
constitutional
right
to
have
an
abortion.
if
she
would
be
rich
or
poor,
the
question
is
if
she
may
or
may
not
be
able
to
find
a
doctor
who’s
willing
to
do
that
grant
if
she
can
pay
his
bill?
justice
potter
stewart
economic
disincentive?
justice
potter
stewart
the
matching
fund,
it’s
a
50%
matching
program
all
away
across
the
board
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
all
50%.
justice
potter
stewart
family
planning
is
80%
or
90%?
justice
potter
stewart
there
nothing
to
be
more
fundamental
than
a
constitutional
right,
constitutionally
guaranteed
right
which
my
brother
stevens
is
hypothesizing?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
say
would
it
be
equally
wrong
or
less
unconstitutional
in
your
hierarchy
of
constitutional
rights
for
a
state
to
say
we’ll
pay
for
appendicitis
operations,
but
not
for
gallstone
operations?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
less
what?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
when
is
that
ever
been
annunciated,
a
right
to
be
subsidized?
