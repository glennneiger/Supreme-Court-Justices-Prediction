mr.
walsh,
what
other
medical
service
do
you
have
to
file
all
of
these
explanations?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
chiropractic
medical?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’m
not
talking
about
hew,
i’m
talking
about
connecticut.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
admit
that
you
do
put
special
emphasis
on
abortions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
put
a
little
more
than
you
do
on
appendectomies?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
due
process
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
is
distinct
and
not
stop
you
from
getting
an
abortion.
well,
the
state
is
not
stopping
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
happen
if
the
state
says
we
will
pay
for
natural
birth,
but
not
a
cesarean,
would
that
be
due
process?
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
best
it
would
be
equal
protection,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mrs.
katz,
could
connecticut
say
that
all
medical
procedures
require
a
certificate
of
the
same
type?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
i
said
could
connecticut
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
would
you
have
any
complaint?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
they
said
that
any
medical
procedure
requiring
payment
must
first
have
the
same
type
of
certificate,
would
that
be
okay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
didn’t
say
pregnancy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
appendicitis,
ingrown
in
toenails,
etcetera.
you
have
to
file
a
certificate
say
that
this
is
medically
necessary
before
you
get
paid?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
answer
is
that
the
state
could
not
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
it
good
for
everything,
but
abortion.
justice
thurgood
marshall
other
than
abortion.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
of
question
i
asked
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
if
it
is
necessary,
that
would
be
alright?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you
now
argue
the
equal
protection
which
what
i
thought
you
arguing
all
along.[laughter]
