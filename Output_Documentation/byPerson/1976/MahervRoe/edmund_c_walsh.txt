mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
facts
in
this
case,
the
plaintiff’s
challenge
connecticut
to
medicaid
policy
on
payment
for
abortion
under
title
19
of
medicaid
program
is
the
same
as
in
the
previous
case.
the
challenge
was
made
on
both
statutory
and
constitutional
grounds.
the
connecticut
policy
which
is
section
275
of
the
welfare
department
manual
provided
that
in
order
for
the
state
to
pay
for
an
abortion
under
the
title
19
program,
the
attending
physician,
the
physician
of
her
choice
was
required
to
submit
a
certificate
of
medical
necessity
which
is
set
forth
at
page
47
of
the
appendix.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
it
says
your
honor
to
allow
--
the
attending
physician
merely
has
to
state
that
in
his
opinion,
the
abortion
is
medically
necessary
for
the
patient’s
health,
that’s
all
and
that
is
not
challenged.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
well
i
think
it’s
even
more
--
more
liberal,
your
honor.
in
addition
to
that
certificate
of
medical
necessity,
the
doctor
must
also
submit
a
form
w601
which
is
at
page
45
of
the
appendix,
requesting
a
prior
authorization,
prior
approval
for
payment
for
the
abortion
and
in
that
form,
he
must
indicate
what
the
medical
need
for
the
abortion
is
and
as
i’ve
just
stated
a
moment
ago
an
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan’s
question,
the
attending
physician’s
medical
judgment
as
to
the
need
for
the
abortion
is
never
questioned
by
connecticut.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
there
are
your
honor,
but
current
press
is
correct,
the
country
is
quite
remiss
in
that
area
the
present
time.
it’s
a
difficult
program
to
police.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
well
in
this
particular
area,
abortion
is
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
oh
your
honor,
there
is
no
question
that
would
be
fraudulent
and
the
state
does
have
a
quality
control
system.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
yes.
theoretically,
the
veracity
is
subject
to
question,
but
i
think
under
roe
versus
wade
the
appropriate
disciplinary
action
in
this
event
might
be
through
the
professional
societies
because
of
the
sensitivity
of
this
particular
medical
service
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
he
would,
your
honor
and
i
believe
at
a
certain
point,
he
would
no
longer
be
accepted
for
participation
in
the
title
19
program.
well,
the
plaintiffs
then
brought
this
action
after
the
refusal
by
the
two
original
plaintiffs.
their
physicians
would
not
submit
the
statement
of
medical
necessity.
there
were
several
subsequent
intervening
plaintiffs
for
which
temporary
restraining
orders
were
granted.
but
in
no
case
that
the
attending
physician
submitted
the
certificate
of
medical
necessity
and
this
action
was
then
brought
challenging
the
state
policy
on
both
statutory
and
constitutional
grounds.
the
single-judge
district
court
on
the
plaintiff’s
motion
for
summary
judgment
disposed
of
the
case
initially
on
the
pendant
statutory
claim
holding
that
the
federal
title
19
statute
required
payment
for
elective
abortion.
the
defending
commissioner
then
appealed
and
the
second
circuit
reversed
and
remanded
holding
in
effect
that
while
title
19
permits
payment
for
abortion,
it
does
not
require
payment
for
elective
abortion.
and
one
judge,
judge
mulligan
of
the
second
circuit
dissented
in
part
from
that
decision.
the
three-judge
court
when
it
remanded,
instructed
--
excuse
me,
the
circuit
court
when
it
remanded,
the
second
circuit
instructed
the
district
court
to
determine
if
connecticut
would
continue
to
refuse
to
pay
for
elective
abortion
since
the
second
circuit
had
now
decided
that
it
was
permissible
to
pay
for
elective
abortions.
state's
position
originally
had
been
that
the
federal
statute
prevented
payment.
the
state
informed
the
court
that
it
would
not
--
it
elected
not
change
its
policy
and
it
would
not
pay
for
elective
abortions.
and
then
once
again,
a
three-judge
court
was
convened
and
once
again
on
the
plaintiff's
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
three-judge
court
after
oral
argument
held
that
connecticut’s
medical
abortion
policy
was
invalid
insofar
as
it
required
certification
that
an
abortion
is
medically
or
psychiatrically
necessary
and
insofar
as
it
requires
prior
to
the
performance
of
an
abortion,
any
form
of
approval
or
consent
or
any
other
condition
or
requirement
for
the
reimbursement
of
the
expenses
of
an
abortion
performed
during
the
first
trimester
of
the
pregnancy.
this
case
was
limited
to
first
trimester
abortions
by
the
three-judge
court
since
there
were
no
second
semester
abortions
performed.
there
is
a
second
semester
abortion
performed
in
the
appendix
at
page
46
or
47
i
believe
which
is
a
little
different,
but
apparently
is
not
at
issue
here.
prior
to
the
entry
of
that
judgment
by
the
three-judge
court,
the
plaintiffs,
the
defending
commissioner
had
made
a
motion
to
strike
certain
affidavits
which
had
been
attached
to
the
plaintiff’s
memorandum
in
support
of
its
motion
for
summary
judgment.
and
at
the
oral
argument,
the
defendant
requested
the
court
to
rule
on
the
motion
to
strike
and
the
court
--
and
the
three-judge
court
said
it
would
rule
on
that
motion,
but
it
never
did
so.
now,
in
striking
down
connecticut’s
medicaid
policy,
the
district
court
held
essentially
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
the
state
to
pay
for
any
medical
services,
but
nevertheless
once
a
state
chooses
to
establish
a
program
to
pay
for
the
medical
expenses
of
the
indigent
and
as
part
of
that
program
it
pays
for
therapeutic
abortions
and
it
pays
for
pregnancy,
child
birth,
prenatal
and
postnatal
care,
but
it
does
not
pay
for
elective
abortions.
in
that
event
that
the
three-judge
court
held
that
it
was
not
--
the
state
was
not
acting
strictly
neutral
and
in
that
--
and
so,
it
was
infringing
thereby
upon
the
plaintiff's
constitutionally
elected
right
to
have
an
abortion
as
announced
in
roe
v.
wade
and
it
cited
dunn
v.
blumstein
in
support
of
its
decision
and
maricopa
county
memorial
hospital
and
shapiro
v.
thompson,
the
presidency
case.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
it’s
not
absolutely
clear,
your
honor.
i
assume
that
in
my
argument
will
it
be
that
it
was
upon
the
equal
protection
argument,
but
there
is
this
a
bit
about
infringing
on
the
right
to
an
abortion
which
conceivably
could
be
based
upon
another
amendment.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
another
part
of
the
same
amendment.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
i
think
it
may
well
have
been
blumstien,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
yes
your
honor.
the
shapiro
case
seems
to
always
come
up
in
any
discussion
of
this
case.
we
believe
that
the
fallacy
of
the
district
court’s
reasoning
in
this
case
was
that
connecticut
has
no
program
for
funding
the
medical
expenses
of
pregnancy
as
such
or
prenatal
or
postnatal
care.
what
it
does
have
is
a
program
to
pay
for
medical
expenses
which
are
medically
necessary
for
the
patient’s
health
and
the
test
--
that
is
the
test,
whether
it’s
medically
necessary
for
the
patient’s
health,
if
it
is,
it
will
be
paid
for,
if
it
is
not,
they
will
be
excluded
except
for
some
medically
necessary
services
which
are
excluded
because
of
their
prohibitive
cost
and
dental
expenses,
particularly
periodontia
and
orthodontia
are
two
that
are
very
costly
that
are
excluded
although
they
are
admittedly
necessary
--
medically
necessary
for
the
patient’s
health.
under
connecticut’s
program,
pregnancy
and
abortion
are
treated
alike.
they
must
both
be
medically
necessary
for
the
patient’s
health
in
order
to
be
paid
for
under
the
program.
i
think
that
the
plaintiff's
make
much
of
the
fact
that
if
you
pay
for
the
expenses
of
pregnancy,
you
should
pay
for
abortion.
but
it
is
the
medical
community
that
has
determined
really
that
the
expenses
of
child
birth
are
medically
necessary
and
there
was
no
testimony
of
any
medical
testimony
and
indeed
the
plaintiffs
have
admitted
in
their
brief
that
the
expenses
of
child
birth
and
pregnancy
are
medically
necessary
for
the
patient’s
health.
now
that
test
of
medical
necessity
has
been
connecticut’s
test
since
the
inception
of
its
program
in
1965.
that
was
nearly
eight
years
before
this
court
announced
the
constitutionally
protective
right
of
a
woman
in
consultation
with
their
physician
to
choose
to
have
an
abortion
in
roe
versus
wade.
the
district
court
did
not
dispute
that
this
test
of
medical
necessity
for
the
patient’s
health
was
the
test
for
payment
under
connecticut’s
program.
the
lower
court
simply
refused
to
judge
whether
this
classification
offended
the
equal
protection
clause
and
instead
the
lower
court
set
forth
its
own
perceived
classification
by
narrowly
focusing
on
how
elective
abortion
was
treated
as
compared
to
pregnancy.
the
lower
court,
we
believe
thereby
was
side
of
the
fact
that
the
test
for
payment
was
whether
the
service
was
medically
necessary
for
the
patient’s
health
and
that
the
whole
purpose
of
the
program
was
to
provide
necessary
healthcare
and
that
pregnancy
or
abortion
or
whatever
were
merely
incidental
treatments
under
the
program
of
medical
providing
necessary
healthcare.
now,
we
think
there
would
be
validity
to
the
district
court’s
opinion
if
connecticut
had
either
done
one
of
the
two
things.
if
connecticut
had
a
separate
program
just
for
payment
of
expenses
of
child
birth
and
pregnancy
or
if
abortions
which
were
admittedly
medically
necessary
for
the
patient’s
health
were
excluded
from
connecticut’s
program
which
they
are
not,
in
either
on
those
events,
we
believe
that
the
rationale
of
the
district
court
would
be
valid,
but
connecticut
has
no
such
programs
and
it
has
never
had
such
programs
and
consequently
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
i
believe
they
could.
according
to
hew’s
amicus
brief
that
was
submitted
to
the
second
circuit
on
the
statutory
question,
your
honor.
hew
says
that
the
states
have
a
very
broad
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
yes
your
honor,
i
believe
so.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
no
your
honor,
we
do
not.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
no.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
well
first
of
all,
we
rely
very
heavily
on
the
physical
interest
because
we
think
it’s
a
very
important
interest
for
the
state
to
be
able
to
control
its
medical
expenditures
in
the
pubic
health
field.
but
what
we
are
also
afraid
of
is
that
the
district
court’s
order
forces
connecticut
to
include
a
service
in
the
state's
program
which
is
admittedly
not
medically
necessary
for
the
patient’s
health
and
i
say
admittedly
because
determination
has
left
to
the
patient’s
own
attending
physician.
and
this
is
the,
pardon
me,
this
is
done
even
when
there
are
other
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
no,
your
honor.
that
would
be
in
my
judgment,
an
indication
that
the
state
legislature
or
in
this
case
the
administrative
agency
was
guilty
of
enacting
foolish
legislation.
it
was
the
wisdom
--
that
would
be
a
challenge
to
the
wisdom
of
the
legislation
because
it
is
somewhat
speculative,
although,
i
think
it
would
be
probably
is
true
that
by
not
granting
elective
abortions,
the
state
will
eventually
pay
more
for
these
people,
some
to
raising
these
children
who
may
end
up
on
welfare
but
that
is
somewhat
speculative.
but
that
is
a
decision
in
our
view
that
is
up
to
the
legislature
or
by
its
delegation
to
the
administrative
agency
because
we
think
it’s
a
perfectly
rational
basis
for
the
state
to
setup
a
program
whose
purpose
is
to
provide
necessary
healthcare
and
that
implies
that
it
will
exclude
unnecessary
healthcare.
when
elective
abortion
as
judge
mulligan
said
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
second
circuit
is
really
starkly
put,
unnecessary
medical
care.
and
that
determination
is
not
made
by
the
state,
it’s
made
by
the
patient’s
attending
physician
because
if
it
is
necessary,
all
he
has
to
do
is
sign
the
certificate
and
the
abortion
will
be
paid
for.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
yes.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
yes
indeed,
your
honor
and
as
the
other
part
of
the
answer
i
was
going
to
say
was
when
the
state
is
compelled
to
include
a
non
necessary
medical
service
in
it’s
program
and
at
the
same
time
because
of
physical
necessity
it
must
exclude
services
like
orthodontia
and
periodontia
and
we
have
two
cases
challenging
and
right
now
in
connecticut,
two
cases
challenging
the
federal
statute
for
excluding
those
things.
we
think
that
it
will
be
almost
impossible
to
defend
those
cases
once
an
unnecessary
medical
service
has
been
included
in
the
program.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
i
think
your
honor
they
are
all
listed
on
page
two
of
appellee’s
brief
in
a
footnote.
they
are
19
reasons
i
believe,
dental
services
except
for
emergency
dental
services,
chiropractic
service,
i
believe
psychiatric
services,
physical
therapy,
there’s
19
altogether,
your
honor.
there
is
a
great
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
pardon?
hew
has
amended
this
statute
sometime
ago
to
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
connecticut
attempted.
this
is
--
connecticut
attempted
to
cut
back
its
medic
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
no.
prior
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
yes
your
honor,
but
the
reason
for
that,
one
of
the
reasons
for
this
seeking
of
prior
approval
is
that
if
it
were
not
done
that
way,
the
hospitals
would
not
know
whether
they
are
going
to
receive
payment
for
the
treatment
until
after
they
had
submitted
their
request
for
payments
to
the
state.
that’s
one
of
the
administrative
reasons
for
the
prior
approval.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
well
as
i
said
your
honor,
it
does
not
prefer
births
to
abortions.
that
only
becomes
about
incidentally
as
these
services
are
either
medically
or
not
medically
necessary.
when
the
program
was
established,
its
purpose
was
to
provide
medically
necessary
healthcare
and
it
really
is
up
to
the
medical
community
and
the
individual
physicians
to
determine
whether
given
services
or
is
not
medically
necessary.
and
so,
it
isn’t
really
that
the
state
is
consciously
favoring
child
birth
over
abortion.
if
that
is
the
state
of
the
medical
art
that
child
birth
is
universally
regarded
as
requiring
necessary
medical
care
i
believe
whereas
in
abortion,
that
is
not
the
case
because
there
are
several
physicians
in
this
action
that
have
submitted
affidavits
distinguishing
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
legislating
to
prevent
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
i
believe
that
they
would
have
an
interest,
yes
your
honor.
that
would
be
for
the
legislature
to
determine
of
course
i
think,
but
i
think
there
would
be
certainly
a
state
interest
to
be
debated
in
the
legislature.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
thank
you.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
were
saying
before
luncheon,
it’s
the
state's
contention
that
there
is
no
invidious
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
its
classification
of
necessary
versus
unnecessary
medical
expenses.
therefore,
there
is
no
denial
of
equal
protection.
i
believe
as
mr.
justice
stewart
in
a
separate
opinion
in
san
antonio
versus
rodriguez
summarized
that
purpose
of
the
equal
protection
clause
was
to
measure
the
validity
of
the
classifications
made
by
the
states.
this
classification
withstands
that
validity
we
believe.
of
course,
the
fact
that
there
is
no
invidious
discrimination
is
not
all.
the
state
must
of
course
prove
that
connecticut’s
action
is
not
a
mere
pretext
or
a
subterfuge
or
as
the
counsel
in
the
previous
case
stated
a
smokescreen
for
the
state
to
discriminate
against
abortion.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
such
a
charge.
the
district
court
rejected
connecticut’s
asserted
purpose
of
preserving
its
physical
integrity
out
of
hand
and
then
it
attribute
--
thereby
attributed
to
the
state
of
connecticut
an
imputative
reason,
if
you
call
it
a
unarticulated
reason
for
avoiding
the
expenditure
of
public
funds
for
purpose,
the
state
found
morally
objectionable.
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
that
that
was
imputative
to
the
state
despite
the
fact
that
connecticut’s
program
included
payment
for
no
other
medical
service
which
was
not
necessary
for
the
patient’s
health,
despite
the
fact
that
other
medical
services
which
were
medically
necessary,
some
were
excluded
because
of
their
prohibitive
cost.
and
another
factor
is
that
the
very
day
after
this
decision
was
announced
december
31,
1975,
the
very
next
day,
connecticut
was
forced
to
implement
cut
backs
in
its
medicaid
program
of
medically
necessary
services
because
of
its
physical
crisis.
as
it
turned
out,
that
was
in
preliminary
enjoined
about
two
weeks
later
and
that
is
the
status
of
that
matter
now.
the
state
has
not
pursued
that.
the
physical
picture
has
brightened
somewhat.
so
all
of
these
factors
attest
to
the
legitimacy
of
the
classification
made
by
connecticut’s
program
and
when
this
was
considered
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
medical
judgment
of
medical
necessity
is
what
solely
to
the
attending
physician
of
the
plaintiff's
own
choice
and
the
further
fact
as
indicated
in
the
answers
to
the
interrogatories
that
prior
to
the
single-judge
district
court’s
entry
of
the
first
injunction,
some
1,410
abortions
were
performed
under
the
state's
program
in
an
eleven-and-a-half
month
period.
so,
we
feel
that
the
imputation
of
the
unarticulated
morally
objectionable
purpose
was
unfounded
and
it
was
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
i
think,
your
honor
that
as
long
as
the
court
is
satisfied
that
the
state
has
a
valid
purpose
and
that
its
primary
motive
is
not
to
see
or
subterfuge
that
the
state
--
that
the
court
should
then
uphold
the
regulation
because
otherwise
it
will
get
into
an
extremely
nebulous
area
of
trying
to
ascertain
subjective
intentions
of
the
legislature
in
this
case.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
i
believe
it
would
not.
i
believe
it
would
not,
your
honor
unless
the
court
established
that
was
the
overriding
purpose.
i
believe
the
chief
justice
in
a
dissent
in
the
eisenstadt
versus
baird
in
which
this
court
has
discredited
massachusetts'
reasons
for
not
permitting
sale
of
contraceptives,
the
chief
justice
said
that
in
the
absence
of
clear
and
convincing
proof
as
to
motivation,
then
the
court
should
not
rule
and
i
think
that
that
is
what
the
situation
in
this
case.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
no
your
honor
because
your
honor
i
said
partly
reason
and
i
say
if
it’s
partly
if
it’s
a
secondary
reason
because
after
all,
all
legislatures
and
executives
for
that
matter
have
their
private
views
on
abortion
and
that
does
not
mean
that
their
private
views
are
necessarily
implanted
or
--
it’s
too
very
difficult
to
determine
what
percentage
of
their
motivation
is
a
factor
in
influencing
their
decision.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
i
think
if
their
where
the
sole
reason,
your
honor
that
would
certainly
a
very
terrible
thing.
i
believe
there
is
an
article
in
79
neil
longer
by
professor
ely
who
says
however
that
his
test
is
as
long
as
the
state
has
the
power
to
do
it,
then
the
motivation
should
not
be
the
factor
because
if
the
succeeding
administration
then
has
a
different
view
why
should
not
the
classification
stand?
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
that’s
right
your
honor.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
of
course
when
you
say
connecticut,
that’s
of
course
some
three
million
citizens
and
i
think
if
in
fact
the
court
is
convinced
that
there
is
a
valid
physical
purpose
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
if
i
understand
your
honor’s
question.
if
you
say
it’s
permissible,
that’s
the
answer
to
the
question.
however,
if
the
sole
motivation
of
the
state
leaders
is
to
impose
their
own
views
on
the
populous,
that
is
not
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
yes
when
it
represents
the
majority
except
that
there
is
a
certain
constitutional
protections
against
the
theority
of
the
majority
which
this
court
has
often
fronted
to
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
oh,
i
think
yes.
that
would
be
a
legitimate
purpose
because
of
the
state
then
would
clearly
have
an
obligation
i
think
to
assure
that
it
has
a
sufficient
number
of
citizens
coming
up
so
to
speak
to
[voice
overlap].
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
i
believe
it
could,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
well,
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
i
believe
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
well
i
had
not
--
that
was
not
my
prime
motivation.
i
was
maybe
mistakenly
trying
to
be
neutral
on
the
question
of
the
morality
of
this
case
because
that
is
a
very
inflammatory
issue.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
it’s
not
here,
i
don’t
believe.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
it
is
here,
your
honor.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
the
district
court
cited
no
evidence
whatever
because
--
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
the
only
evidence,
if
you
could
call
it
that
your
honor,
was
a
newspaper
clipping
attached
to
the
plaintiff’s
memorandum
in
the
court
for
motion
for
summary
judgment
purporting
to
convey
the
views
of
the
governor
of
the
state
of
connecticut
on
abortion
and
we
made
a
motion
to
strike
that
that
was
inadmissible
evidence.
mr.
edmund
c.
walsh
the
motion
was
never
ruled
on,
although
the
court
said
it
would
rule
on
it.
so
in
summary
your
honor,
we
believe
that
what
is
involved
here
is
not
an
interference
by
the
state
to
a
woman’s
right
to
an
abortion.
the
issue
is
rather
--
the
right
to
receive
public
welfare
benefits
and
in
that
case,
we
believe
this
case
should
be
controlled
by
the
test
annunciated
in
dandridge
versus
williams.
i’d
like
to
reserve
anytime
i
have
left,
your
honor.
