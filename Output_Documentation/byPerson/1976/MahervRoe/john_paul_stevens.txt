justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
walsh,
if
we
analyze
the
case
as
an
equal
protection
case
for
a
moment,
the
three-judge
district
court
seem
to
say
that
whether
it’s
a
compelling
state
interest
or
rational
basis
test,
connecticut
has
not
advanced
any
state
interest
whatsoever
for
discriminating
between
pregnant
women
who
elect
an
abortion
as
opposed
to
pregnant
women
who
elect
to
bear
the
child.
they
say
the
physical
interest
cuts
the
other
way
and
that
there
is
no
other
interest
involved.
do
you
rely
in
any
state
interest
for
that
and
if
so
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if,
let
me
just
take
this
to
the
two
parts
to
your
answer.
first
on
the
physical
point;
if
a
trial
should
establish
and
there
should
be
findings
of
fact,
now
the
court,
the
district
court
just
stated
the
conclusion
that
it
actually
would
save
the
state
money
because
it
will
eliminate
certain
welfare
costs
and
eliminate
the
expense
of
child
birth
for
the
people
in
this
category
to
have
--
to
allow
the
abortions.
would
that
not
be
a
complete
answer
to
your
physical
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
you
are
saying
--
let
me
just
see
if
i
can
state
in
my
own
language.
i’m
not
quite
sure
i
have
it,
but
you’re
saying
the
state
could
rationally
establish
a
program
that
differentiated
between
necessary
and
unnecessary
medical
care,
and
when
you
establish
such
a
program
this
distinction
just
falls
into
place?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that’s
what
you’re
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it’s
a
due
process
case,
do
we
have
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
question
whether
benefits
are
provided
in
the
event
that
the
child
is
born,
apparently?
would
your
case,
in
a
due
process
term,
would
your
case
be
just
as
strong,
i’m
incline
to
think
it
would,
even
if
the
state
had
no
welfare
program
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
that
was
limited
to
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
it
be
different
in
due
process
terms?
i
can
see
why
it
would
be
different
in
equal
protection
terms,
but
in
due
process
terms,
it
would
seem
to
me
it
would
be
precisely
the
same
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn’t
that
an
equal
protection
argument
though?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
state
your
due
process
argument
in
sort
of
simplified
form
for
me?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
are
going
in
equal
protection
of
course.
i
just
--
i’d
like
to
think
that
the
two
different
arguments
through
separately
because
i
think
they
may
--
one
maybe
stronger
than
the
other.
in
the
case
involving
this
teaching
of
german
in
schools
was
held
to
be
a
denial
of
due
process
to
deprive
the
parents
of
the
right
to
send
children
to
school
where
german
was
taught,
would
it
be
a
denial
of
due
process
if
the
--
could
the
parents
have
insisted
that
the
schools
provide
the
teaching
of
german
in
public
schools?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
how
was
that
now
--
does
that
refute
your
due
process
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be
a
denial
of
either
constitutional
right
for
the
state
to
subsidize
an
educational
program
urging
women
to
bear
children
and
to
make
the
choice
one
way
rather
than
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
would
they
be
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mrs.
katz,
let
me
take
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question
one
step
further.
assume
a
state
concerned
with
over
population
were
to
adapt
the
statute
that
provided
for
everyone,
the
poor
as
well
--
and
the
rich
is
well
as
the
poor
that
the
price
of
an
abortion
will
be
paid
plus
a
$50.00
bonus.
would
that
be
constitutional?
the
reason
being
they
want
to
control
a
population.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
assume
in
my
example
that
they
continue
to
pay
for
child
birth
for
the
indigent,
but
they
just
try
to
tip
the
scales
in
favor
of
abortion
in
the
desire
to
control
population.
you
say
there'd
be
a
constitutional
objection
and
if
so
what
is
the
constitutional
objection?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
say
the
state
has
no
interest
whatsoever,
no
legitimate
interest
in
the
rate
of
population
within
its
borders?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then
if
it
has
an
interest,
why
can’t
it
tip
the
scales
one
way
or
another
or
seek
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
prior
decisions
say
you
cannot
pay
a
bonus
for
one
choice
rather
than
another?
the
prior
decision
deals
with
preventing
the
choice.
that’s
quite
different
it
seems
to
me
from
urging
one
choice
rather
another
and
being
willing
to
pay
a
bonus
for?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i’m
trying
to
identify
in
my
own
mind
is
whether
it’s
critical
to
your
case
that
we
treat
this
as
something
like
a
deprivation
as
oppose
to
a
subsidy.
is
it
critical
for
you
to
regard
this
as
something
that
deters
the
women
from
making
one
choice
rather
than
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there’s
really
no
penalty
here?
there
is
no
penalty
here.
there
is
a
loss
of
an
opportunity
to
get
a
benefit
if
you
made
the
other
choice
and
not
quite
the
same
as
a
penalty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mrs.
katz,
i’m
not
sure
that
completely
meets
your
opponent’s
argument.
as
i
understand
him,
he’s
saying
that
if
we
eliminate
the
line
between
necessary
and
unnecessary,
you’ll
have
to
have
a
whole
host
of
additional
services
which
will
unfold
cost
over
and
above
just
the
abortion
cost
and
that
that’s
what
you
have
to
measure
on
both
sides
of
the
scale?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
district
court,
that
they
talked
about
cosmetic
surgery,
the
district
court
said
well,
that’s
different
because
it
is
not
a
constitutionally
protected
right,
but
i
just
wonder
if
that’s
valid.
do
you
suppose
the
state
could
constitutionally
pass
a
statute
that
said
nobody
shall
have
cosmetic
surgery?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
do
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
cosmetic
surgery?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
a
person
seriously
disfigured
is
the
result
of
an
accident,
wanted
to
have
plastic
surgery
to
correct
his
appearance
and
the
state
said
no,
we
have
a
statute
that
prohibits
that.
you
would
say
that’s
not
constitutionally
protected
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
as
well
protected
as
the
right
to
make
the
abortion
you
say?
