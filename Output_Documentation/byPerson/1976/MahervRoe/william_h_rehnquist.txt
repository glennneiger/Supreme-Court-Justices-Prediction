rehnquist
mr.
walsh,
i
suppose
there
maybe
larger
concerns
on
both
sides
surrounding
the
question
of
abortion
then
there
are
to
question
of
appendectomy
or
orthodontia.
in
defending
your
statute
against
a
strictly
equal
protection
attack,
do
you
think
the
state
can
make
any
argument
that
has
a
--
at
least
it
can
advance
as
a
rational
consideration
of
policy
to
prefer
births
to
abortion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
okay.
what
if
in
connecticut
for
some
reason,
although
the
entire
medical
profession
took
the
view
that
abortions
were
very
much
to
be
preferred
to
births,
so
that
the
result
was
that
even
though
women
might
not
initially
choose
that
course,
connecticut’s
birth
rate
simply
declined
to
zero.
do
you
think
the
state
would
have
no
interest
in
legislating
to
prevent
that
result
if
the
legislature
chose
to
do
so?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
fall
of
the
birth
rate
to
zero?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
be
the
constitutional
basis
in
your
view
for
saying
that
if
the
connecticut
statute
was
the
primary
reason
for
passing,
as
justice
stewart’s
question,
was
the
moral
objection
to
abortion?
why
would
that
make
it
constitutionally
invalid
if
there
isn’t
any
other
constitutional
objection
to
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we’re
assuming
there
is
no
valid
physical
purpose
that
the
state
of
connecticut
in
it's
legislature
and
a
legislative
history
of
a
bill
says
we
will
go
as
far
as
we
have
to
under
the
supreme
court’s
decision
and
under
the
constitution
and
we
will
not
criminally
punish
any
doctor
who
provides
an
abortion,
but
we
morally
object
to
abortions
and
we
will
not
go
any
further
than
the
supreme
court
requires
us
to
go
and
we
think
this
is
permissible.
we
are
going
to
limit
abortion
in
every
way
that
we
constitutionally
can?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn’t
that
the
motivation
of
every
single
legislative
act
that’s
ever
passed
by
a
legislature
to
impose
the
views
of
the
legislature
on
the
populous?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
katz
what
if
your
client
were
at
the
other
end
of
spectrum
here
so
to
speak?
she
where
in
a
state
which
had
under
it’s
medicaid
policy
said
we
will
--
we
are
very
concerned
about
too
much
population.
so,
we
will
fund
abortions,
but
not
child
birth.
we
realize
you
can’t
--
we
won’t
interfere
with
child
birth.
we
simply
won’t
fund
them.
your
client
wanted
to
have
a
full
term
delivery
and
not
an
abortion.
do
you
think
your
constitutional
argument
is
the
state
program
was
invalid
and
would
stand
on
the
same
footing
as
the
one
you
are
now
making?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
annunciated
a
right
to
it
for
any
forms
of
surgery?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you’re
saying
then
that
the
state
has
to
have
a
program
of
free
medical
services
for
indigents
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
because
there
is
a
choice.
you
know,
if
i
got
a
bad
stomach
ache,
i
got
a
choice
of
going
to
the
doctor
and
not
going
to
the
doctor.
and
if
i
don’t
have
any
money,
i
don’t
have
a
choice
of
going
to
the
doctor
unless
there
is
some
assistance
program
available
to
me.
