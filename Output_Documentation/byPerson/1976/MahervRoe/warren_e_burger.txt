mr.

i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
some
of
the
categories
might
be
wise
and
some
might
be
unwise,
but
you
say
the
legislature
has
a
right
to
make
its
own
mistakes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
within
that
broad
reach
that
you
argue,
also
the
state
could
be
like
the
legislature,
could
say
we
will
pay
for
cosmetic
surgery
in
order
to
make
our
people
more
beautiful
if
they
wanted
to.

that
the
state
has
a
responsibility,
an
affirmative
responsibility
for
the
moral
environment
and
atmosphere

a
community
within
the

chief

warren
e.

answer
justice

question?
chief

warren
e.
