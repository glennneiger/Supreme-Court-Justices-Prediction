unknown
speaker
but
the
only
reason
he
did
not
serve
in
the
korean
war
was
because
his
unit
was
inactive.
isn't
that
true?
unknown
speaker
so
it
was
no
fault
of
his.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
significance
of
the
dates
september
8,
1940
on
the
one
hand
and
january
1st,
1947
on
the
other
...
unknown
speaker
...
rather
than
december
7th,
1941
and
august
1945.
unknown
speaker
he
was
little
late
in
getting
around
to
it,
wasn't
he?
unknown
speaker
the
triggering
effect
on
other
legislation
and
executive
orders.
unknown
speaker
has
there
been
an
administrative
determination
that
an
applicant
cannot
simply
waive
any
prior
service,
say,
"i
am
relying
only
on
my
20
years’
service
after
1945
--
'47"?
unknown
speaker
well,
has
that
been
decided?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
this
case,
except
there
was
no
effort
to
waive.
it
was
all
brought
out,
"here's
my
service".
unknown
speaker
he
declined
to
waive
now,
i
am
sure.
unknown
speaker
does
the
amount
of
the
pension
depend
upon
the
years
of
service
over
20;
i.e.,
my
question
is,
if
one
has
served
20
years,
does
he
get
the
same
pension
as
a
person
who
served
29
years?
unknown
speaker
so,
if
a
person
did
waive
his
pre-1947
years
of
service,
he
would
be
waiving
something.
unknown
speaker
less,
less,
less
retirement
pay.
unknown
speaker
and
what
do
you
say
is
unreasonable
and
unconstitutional
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
except
...
must
you
not
concede
that
the
statutory
language
is
very
clear
...
unknown
speaker
...
that
a
person
is
not
eligible,
it
says,
for
retired
pay
under
this
chapter?
unknown
speaker
would
you
answer
my
question,
and
then
you
can
explain
it?
unknown
speaker
that
that
is
not
what
congress
meant
to
say.
unknown
speaker
instead
of
"shall
not
be
eligible
for
retired
pay
under
this
chapter".
unknown
speaker
mr.
goldfarb,
even
under
your
view
of
the
statute,
say
two
men
in
1945,
each
of
whom
has
had
20
years
in
the
reserve,
but
say
one
of
them
like
your
client
...
say
your
client
needed
the
five
prewar
years
to
get
his
20.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
what
you
think
that
the
statute
means.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
think
the
congress
did
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
they
measure
the
benefits
post-'48
any
differently
then
just
showed
up
for
so
many
drills
and
wasn’t
put
on
report
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
well,
wasn’t
pre-world
war
ii
reserve
service
compensated?
unknown
speaker
it
was
compensated,
but
there
was
no
retirement,
isn’t
that
it?
unknown
speaker
as
you
read
the
district
court’s
opinion,
do
you
read
it
to
adopt
your
first
argument,
i.e.,
that
under
the
statute
as
properly
construed
your
client
is
entitled
to
retirement
pay,
or
do
you
read
it
as
adopting
your
second
argument,
i.e.,
that
the
statute
can
only
be
construed
as
it
is
in
written,
but
that
such
a
statute
is
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
clear
to
me,
either.
unknown
speaker
"we
need
not
and
should
not
defer
to
the
army’s
construction."
unknown
speaker
and
that
construction
is
at
odds
with
congress’s
clear
purposes
and
goals.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
say
earlier
that
it
is
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
they
did
not
have
to
say
both,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
"accordingly,
we
hold
that
as
applied
to
plaintiff,
the
statute
violates
the
minimum
requirements
imposed
by
the
equal
protection
clause."
unknown
speaker
yes,
as
applied
to
the
plaintiff
...
unknown
speaker
...
and
the
other
members
of
his
class.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
say
it
is
unconstitutional
to
apply
it.
unknown
speaker
but
then
later,
they
say,
"we
do
not
construe
the
statute
to
disqualify
him."
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
not
your
burden
to
testify
to
every
sentence
in
the
opinion.
unknown
speaker
well,
as
justice
white
suggested,
there
would
be
myriad
purposes
they
would
have
in
mind;
but
certainly
that
testimony
indicates
that
the
military
were
very
much
interested
in
keeping
these
younger
men
with
active
duty
in
the
reserves.
unknown
speaker
would
it
had
been
a
rational
purpose,
had
it
been
expressed,
but
would
it
have
been
a
rational
purpose
to
say
that
a
man
who
had
some
substantial
prewar
service
and
then
some
substantial
20
years
after
the
war,
but
not
be
given
any
special
favors
as
compared
with
the
men
who
had
those
factors
plus
active
duty?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
this
man
fall
in
any
one
of
those
categories?
unknown
speaker
for
five
years
after
the
accident.
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
support
that?
unknown
speaker
where
did
he
find
the
evidence
to
make
the
finding
of
fact?
unknown
speaker
and
showing
no
evidence,
then,
at
all.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
the
class,
whatever
his
individual
reasons
were,
that
does
not
affect
the
class,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
the
class
might
include
people
with
reasons
similar
to
this
asserted
reason
or
for
no
reason
or
for
reasons
of
cowardice
or
for
reasons
of
heroism
or
all
sorts
of
different
reasons.
unknown
speaker
but
they
inferentially
as
a
group
would
be
younger
men.
unknown
speaker
not
necessarily,
but
they
would…
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
some
of
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
a
70-year-old
man
cannot
go
down
and
enter
for
the
first
time,
can
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
there
some
age
limit
for
an
original
applicant?
unknown
speaker
so
at
least
you
can
say
that
you
cannot
originally
apply
if
you
are
over
60,
because
you
are
eligible
to
retire
mandatorily.
unknown
speaker
perhaps
i
did
not
get
straight
your
answer
to
brother
stevens'
question
as
to
what
you
thought
the
purpose
of
congress
was
in
barring,
as
you
seem
to
concede,
are
barred
by
the
statute
a
man
who
had
15
years
after
and
5
years
before
without
wartime
service
before.
unknown
speaker
so,
here
are
two
people
who
both
with
15
years
after
the
war
and
5
years
before;
one
of
them
had
wartime
overseas
service,
and
the
other
one
did
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
did
they
say
one
gets
retirement
and
one
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
not
talking
about
mr.
fioto.
unknown
speaker
no,
you
are
describing
what
the
test
is;
but
what
is
the
rationale
for
distinguishing
between
those
two
men?
unknown
speaker
what
doubt?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
merits
thing,
you
think.
unknown
speaker
you
served
and
the
other
fellow
did
not,
and
therefore
we
are
going
to
give
you
retirement.
unknown
speaker
mr.
goldfarb,
what
is
your
support
for
your
suggestion
that
there
was
an
inability
on
the
part
of
the
military
establishment
to
evaluate
the
quality
of
the
service
performed
before
1948?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
records
were
available
so
that
that
kind
of
computation
could
have
made
with
respect
to
pre-1948
service?
unknown
speaker
they
wanted
a
new
point
system
to
be
uniform
as
between
the
army
and
the
navy.
unknown
speaker
but
they
are
counting
the
pre-1948
service
for
those
who
did
serve
during
world
war
ii,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
also
gave
it
to
people
who
might
not
have
been
in
the
war,
but
first
did
the
reserve
service
in
'46
and
'47.
unknown
speaker
apparently,
there
were
records
available
for
those
years.
unknown
speaker
but
they
were
able
to
-–
i
mean,
they
did
not
need
a
point
system
to
decide
those
years
qualified
is
what
i
am
saying.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
urbanczyk,
will
you
explain
to
me
how
they
computed
the
year
in
1946
and
'47?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
that
mean
that
attending
one
drill
in
1947
would
give
a
man
a
full
year’s
credit?
