justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
case,
the
secretary
of
the
army
has
appealed
directly
to
this
court
from
an
adverse
judgement
entered
by
a
three-judge
district
court
sitting
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york.
after
world
war
ii,
congress
authorized
retirement
pay
for
non-regular
military
personnel
with
at
least
20
years
of
service
in
the
reserves
or
national
guard.
however,
those
who
had
been
in
the
reserves
before
world
war
ii
were
not
eligible
for
benefits
unless
they
perform
service,
performed
active
duty
during
war
time.
appellee
is
such
a
person.
he
contends
that
he
may
not
be
denied
benefits
for
which
he
is
otherwise
eligible,
simply
because
he
had
pre-war
service.
in
the
district
court,
he
argued
that
the
statute
violates
the
equal
protection
principle
inherent
in
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
in
this
court,
he
makes
the
additional
argument
that
the
statute
should
be
construed
as
merely
providing
that
his
years
of
pre-war
service
must
be
ignored
for
the
purpose
of
determining
his
eligibility.
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
reject
both
arguments
and
unanimously
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
