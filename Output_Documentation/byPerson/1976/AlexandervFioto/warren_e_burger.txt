against

mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.

but
was
that
not
directed
specifically
to
encourage
men
with
combat
experience,
with
active
service
experience
at
least,
to
go
into
the
reserves?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wasn't
that
essentially
the
testimony
of
colonel
maas
that
you
refer
to
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
excuse
me
before
we
go
on.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
focus
of
that
revitalization,
as
you
put
it,
was
to
get
not
desk
soldiers
or
just
the
ordinary
national
guardsmen,
but
get
the
young
men
who
had
been
in
active
service
during
the
wartime
to
move
into
the
reserves
so
that
they
would
have
at
least
a
partially
combat-trained
reserve.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
rest
on
that
as
the
basis
for
a
different
treatments
of
those
who
have
had
active-duty
service.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you,
