mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
by
the
secretary
of
the
army
from
a
judgment
of
the
three-judge
district
court
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york.
the
case
generally
concerns
a
provision
of
the
army
and
air
force
vitalization
and
retirement
equalization
act,
a
statute
enacted
in
1948
to
establish
retirement
pay
for
non-regular
military
servicemen.
the
provision
at
issue
here,
10
u.s.c.
1331(c),
precludes
appellees
and
others
from
becoming
eligible
for
benefits
or
retirement
pay
under
this
act.
the
district
court
held
that
that
statutory
eligibility
bar
as
it
applies
to
appellees
violates
the
principle
of
equal
protection
that
inheres
in
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment,
and
the
district
court
has,
in
effect,
enjoined
the
continued
enforcement
of
that
provision.
the
pertinent
facts
of
this
case
are
simple
and
straightforward.
the
act
was
passed
in
1948
after
the
war.
in
the
act,
congress
for
the
first
time
established
a
modest
form
of
retirement
pay
for
members
of
the
armed
forces
reserve
and
the
national
guard.
i
use
the
term
"modest",
because
under
the
computation
formula,
the
amount
of
retirement
pay
that
an
eligible
reservist
usually
would
receive
is
relatively
modest
and
relatively
small.
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
record
shows
that
if
he
were
eligible,
appellee
fioto
would
receive
annually
$1100.
now,
to
be
eligible
to
receive
retirement
pay
under
this
act,
the
statute
provides
generally
that
an
individual
must
be
at
least
60
years
old
and
have
performed
20
years
of
eligible
or
qualifying
service.
but
those
general-eligibility
criteria
are
expressly
made
subject
to
the
exception
in
section
1331(c),
which
is
the
statutory
provision
under
consideration
in
this
case.
section
1331(c)
pertains
to
all
individuals
who
are
in
the
reserves
prior
to
august
16th,
1945.
that
date
marks
the
announcement
by
japan
that
they
would
unconditionally
surrender
and
the
beginning
of
demobilization
in
world
war
ii.
as
originally
enacted,
the
statute
provided
that
individuals
in
the
non-regular
military
service
before
that
date
were
ineligible
to
receive
retirement
pay
if
they
failed
to
perform
active-duty
service
during
either
world
war.
in
1958,
the
statute
was
amended
to
permit
such
individuals
to
receive
retirement
pay
or
to
become
eligible
to
receive
retirement
pay
if
they
had
subsequently
served
on
active
duty
in
the
korean
war.
appellee
fioto’s
case,
i
think,
illustrates
the
application
of
this
statute.
mr.
fioto
was
in
the
national
guard
from
1933
to
1940.
the
record
does
not
explain
the
reason
why
his
enlistment
was
discontinued
at
that
time;
but
in
any
event,
his
enlistment
was
discontinued,
and
he
did
not
serve
on
active
duty
in
world
war
ii.
in
1947,
shortly
after
the
war,
mr.
fioto
rejoined
and
re-enlisted
in
the
national
guard,
and
he
thereafter
served
for
20
years
until
his
mandatory
retirement
age
in
1967.
fioto
did
not
serve
on
active
duty
during
the
korean
war.
now,
the
retirement
pay
act,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
was
enacted
in
1948,
less
than
a
year
after
mr.
fioto
re-enlisted
in
the
reserves
in
1947.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
is
what
the
record
--
the
record
shows
that
he
did
not
serve
on
active
duty
in
korean
war,
because
his
...
that
is
what
the
court
found,
because
his
unit
was
not
activated,
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
the
reason
for
his
not
serving
on
active
duty
in
the
korean
war,
the
court
found,
was
through
no
fault
of
his
own,
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
is
an
interesting
question,
your
honor.
i
can
give
you
the
answer
to
second
one.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
on
august
27th,
1940,
congress
passed
and
the
president
signed
a
bill
authorizing
him
to
call
up
a
national
guard
in
this
hemisphere
for
a
year;
and
also
on
september
16th,
the
selective
service
act
was
passed.
so,
about
that
time,
the
government
was
beginning
to
mobilize
in
preparation
for
the
war.
now,
the
january
1st,
1947
date
is
an
interesting
one.
december
31,
1946
was
the
date
that
president
truman
formally
announced
an
end
of
hostilities
in
the
world
war.
so
even
though
we
had
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
ve
day
and
vj
day,
yes,
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
history
will
show
that
he
did
that
primarily
to
reduce
excise
and
other
luxury
taxes;
but
in
any
event,
that
was
the
case.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
is
right.
in
any
event,
that
does
mark
the,
i
guess,
the
official
historical
end
to
world
war
ii
for
this
country.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
is
correct.
we
have
conceded
that
in
this
case,
that
is
right,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
after
his
retirement,
fioto’s
applications
for
retirement
pay
were
denied
predictably
under
section
1331(c),
and
he
then
filed
this
lawsuit
on
behalf
of
himself
and
others
similarly
situated.
now,
in
the
complaint
in
the
district
court,
and
indeed
until
the
brief
on
the
merits
in
this
court,
appellees
have
implicitly
conceded
that
they
were
barred
from
eligibility
by
section
1331(c).
their
sole
contention
instead
was
that
that
statute
was
unconstitutional,
and
that
has
been
the
focus
of
this
litigation.
now,
for
the
first
time
in
their
brief,
they
make
the
contention
--
and
it
appears
to
be
their
principle
contention
now
--
that
the
section
1331(c)
does
not
bar
appellees.
i
can
only
take
this
to
be
an
implicit
acknowledgment
of
the
weakness
of
their
constitutional
argument.
but
before
addressing
that
argument,
i
should
make
mention,
then,
of
what
we
stated
briefly
in
our
brief,
and
that
is
that
section
13,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
section
1331(c)
bars
individuals
like
appellees
from
receiving
retirement
pay
under
this
act.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
class
is
defined
as
individuals
who
have
had
now
20
years
of
service
since
1945,
but
who
also
were
in
the
non-military
service
at
some
point
prior
to
1945
and
did
not
serve
on
active
duty
during
the
war.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
i
hate
to
use
the
word
"penalized",
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
is
right.
this
class
must
be
presumed
to
have
known
in
1948
--
that
is
when
the
statute
was
enacted
--
that
they
would
not
be
eligible
or
they
could
not
become
eligible
to
receive
retirement
pay,
and
this
appellee
class
nevertheless
continued
their
enlistment.
as
i
was
saying,
the
statute
could
not
be
written
in
any
plainer
terms.
the
general-eligibility
criteria
of
section
1331
are
made
expressly
subject
to
subsection
(c).
that
provision
says
that
no
individual
who
was
in
the
non-regular
military
service
before
august
16th,
1945,
quote,
“is
eligible
for
retired
pay
under
this
chapter
unless
he
performed
active
duty”,
and
then
it
goes
on
to
specify
the
dates
that
correspond
to
the
beginning
and
end
of
the
world
wars
and
the
korean
war.
there
is
only
one
reasonable
construction
of
that
statute,
i
think,
and
that
is
that
persons
described
by
it,
including
appellees,
are,
“not
eligible
for
retired
pay
under
this
chapter”.
moreover,
as
we
explained
in
our
brief,
congress
understood
both
at
the
time
of
the
statute’s
enactment
and
subsequently
thereafter
when
it
was
reconsidering
this
statute,
that
that
was
the
effect
of
section
1331(c).
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
no,
i
am
sorry.
one
of
the
problems
with
the
judgment
in
this
case
is
that
we
would
have
to
go
through
several
million
files
in
order
to
identify
who
it
was
that
might
be
eligible
for
this
retirement
pay.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
if
he
had
not
mentioned
what,
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
no,
i
think
the
application
would
then
have
called
for
the
bringing
forth
of
his
records
and
the
reviewing
of
his
records.
i
am
not
sure
what
his
application
looked
like.
it
is
in
the
record
now,
and
i
forget
whether
he
made
mention
of
his
prior
service.
but
in
any
event
the
record
was
found,
and
it
was
seen
that
he
had
served
prior
to
1945,
and
he
was
explicitly
denied
retirement
benefits
on
the
basis
of
that
prior
service.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
the
waiver
would
not
be
permitted
by
the
express
terms
of
this
statute.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well,
it
has
been
decided,
i
would
think,
implicitly
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well,
mr.
fioto,
i
think
in
his
current
brief,
has
indicated
that
he
would
be
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
--
that
he
would
be
unwilling
to
or
that
he
would
be
willing
to
forego
those
seven
years
and
just
count
on
these
20;
but
the
point
is,
in
1948
congress
made
the
determination
that
it
was
unwilling
to
offer
this
retirement-pay
incentive
to
this
individual.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
no.
the
computation
formula
is
a
little
complex;
but
what
it
is
basically
is,
you
take
the
monthly
pay
that
this
person
would
have
received
as
a
reservist,
you
multiple
it
times
2.5%
times
the
years
of
service
that
he
performed.
now,
but
the
catch
on
that
is,
a
reservist,
a
year
of
service
may
only
count
--
one
year
of
serving
may
only
count
as
50
days
for
the
purpose
of
computing
the
amount
of
retirement
pay
he
would
receive,
so
that
typically
it
would
take
seven
years
of
service
to
count
for
one
year
in
terms
of
computing
how
much
retirement
pay
a
person
would
receive.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
is
right,
he
would
be
receiving
less
retirement
pay.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
is
correct.
i
think,
though,
that
the
crucial
constitutional
question,
since
i
think
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
statute
does
pertain
to
appellees
and
does
bar
them
from
receiving
retirement
pay,
is
whether
the
section
1331(c)
is
rationally
related
to
a
valid
legislative
purpose.
as
we
have
explained
at
length
in
our
brief,
the
statute
under
consideration
here
is
related
to
the
two
principle
purposes
of
the
act.
the
act
was
designed
first
as
a
cost-effective
method
of
enlisting
and
maintaining
a
peacetime
reserve
of
individuals
who
would
be
willing
to
fight,
if
necessary,
and
who
would
be
trained
or
have
the
experience
to
fight
effectively;
and,
second,
the
act
was
designed
to
reward
the
past
service
of
those
who
had
performed
the
functions
for
which
a
militia
is
maintained
by
serving
on
active
duty
in
wartime.
i
do
not
think
i
need
to
elaborate
these
general
considerations
beyond
what
is
said
in
the
brief.
in
response,
appellees
seem
to
suggest
that
the
statute
was
intended
to
provide
essentially
an
undifferentiated
incentive
to
one
and
all
to
join
the
reserves.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well,
if
he
was
activated
and
put
on
active
duty
and
therefore
served
his
country
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
yes,
that
is
correct.
he
would
be
eligible
under
the
statute.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
the
point
of
the
korean
statute
or
the
korean
amendment
was
to
permit
individuals
who
for
one
reason
or
another
had
been
unable
to
fight
in
the
war
in
world
war
ii,
if
they
were
called
on
active
duties
then
to
be
able
to
become
eligible
to
receive
retirement
pay.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well,
i
think
the
general
statute
pertains
to
people
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well,
i
do
not
know
that,
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
do
not
know
what
he
could
do
to
have
joined
on
active
duty
during
the
korean
war.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well,
no,
i
do
not.
i
think
that
the
essential
point
here
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
no,
but
the
essential
point
in
the
statute
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
may
well
be
correct,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
it
was
beyond
his
control
as
to
whether
or
not
he
served
on
active
duty
in
the
korean
war?
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
i
am
afraid
i
cannot
answer
the
question
yes
or
no.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
i
am
sure
there
was
not,
mr.
justice...
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well,
there
is
another
answer,
too,
i
think,
although
that
is
certainly
one
answer.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well,
if
he
had
served
on
active
duty
in
any
capacity,
i
think
he
would
then
have
been
qualified
to
receive
retirement
pay
or
to
become
eligible
for
retirement
pay.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
yes,
i
think
that
is
right,
if
he
had
served
on
active
duty;
but
the
gist
of
this
statute,
i
think,
is
directed
at
individuals
who
failed
to
serve
on
active
duty
during
the
two
world
wars.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
was
one
of
those
essential
purposes
of
the
act.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
yes,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
is
correct,
and
that
is,
as
you
say
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
just
a
minute
or
two,
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
i
agree
with
you,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
the
district
court’s
opinion
is
somewhat
vague
on
its
intent;
but
i
think
the
most
reasonable
construction
is
that
the
district
court
held
this
statute
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
appellees.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well,
that
is
my
point.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
is
correct.
