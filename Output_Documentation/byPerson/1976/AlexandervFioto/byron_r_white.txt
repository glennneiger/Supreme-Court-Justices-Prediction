justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
if
the
court
had
just
stopped
with
saying
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
as
construed
to
cover
your
client
to
exclude
him,
then
does
it
automatically
follow
that
the
government
would
have
to
pay
the
retirement?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
an
equal-protection
argument;
it
is
an
equal-protection
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
constitutional
violation
is
that
you
are
treating
two
classes
differently
that
should
have
been
treated
the
same,
there
is
more
than
one
way
of
curing
the
discrimination.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
know
what
congress’s
intention
might
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
if
they
knew
half
their
statute
was
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
you
agreed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
know
they
do
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
but
how
do
you
know
if
they
say,
"we
are
going
to
discourage
as
many
as
we
can
by
this
particular
provision"?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
if
you
keep
saying
that,
why
you
have
bound
to
win.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
purpose
is
not
to
give
them
pay;
the
purpose
is
not
to
give
them
retirement.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
you
keep
saying
that;
but
i
am
just
positing
to
you
that
let
us
just
assume
that
it
was
perfectly
clear
in
the
statute
that
the
purpose
was
to
discourage
people
from
staying
in,
and
that
they
were
doing
it
and
they
are
going
to
discourage
it
by
not
providing
for
retirement
pay.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
congress
could
not
have
had
more
than
one
purpose
in
the
same
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
was
not
unconstitutional
-–
you
think
it
was
unconstitutional
to
discourage
people
from
staying
in
the
army?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
the
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
recently
were
trying
to
encourage,
were
they
not,
the
combat
active-duty
members
to
stay
in
the
reserves?
