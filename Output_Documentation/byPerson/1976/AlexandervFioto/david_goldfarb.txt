mr.
david
goldfarb
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
david
goldfarb
we
feel
that
the
intent
of
congress
was,
in
order
to
get
credit
for
those
years,
you
must
have
served
in
the
war;
but
they
never
intended
to
exclude
people
with
20
years
of
measurable
service
under
the
new
point
system.
mr.
david
goldfarb
we
say
that
the
--
mr.
david
goldfarb
well,
we
think
as
both
the
court
below
and
the
u.s.
attorney
felt
at
that
time
that
it
was
legislative
oversight
in
the
wording
of
this
statute,
that
the
intent
--
mr.
david
goldfarb
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
we
will
agree,
would
disentitle
our
client
to
retired
pay;
however,
we
feel
that
a
different
construction
should
be
given
to
that
--
mr.
david
goldfarb
we
feel
that
is
not
what
congress
meant
to
say
and
that
the
court
can
give
a
different
interpretation
to
the
statute,
that
you
can
read
in
the
words
that
"shall
not
qualify
for
credit
for
those
years
before
1945"
that
--
mr.
david
goldfarb
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
goldfarb
yes,
because
we
feel
--
mr.
david
goldfarb
yes.
mr.
david
goldfarb
well,
the
reason
we
feel
that
there
was
no
measurable
way
of
knowing
how
good
that
service
was
before
1948
when
they
passed
the
point
system.
mr.
david
goldfarb
no,
there
was
not
a
way
to
measure
what
the
national
reservists
were
doing.
mr.
david
goldfarb
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
compensation
system
for
reserve
service
was
passed
at
around
the
same
time
in
1948
that
this
came
into
effect.
mr.
david
goldfarb
no,
my
understanding
is
that
along
about
...
we
mention
in
our
brief
another
statute
that
was
passed
around
the
same
period
of
time
that
gave
compensation
for
the
drills
that
reservists
participated
in,
and
before
that
it
is
my
understanding
that
it
was
not
compensated.
mr.
david
goldfarb
yes,
that
they
were
in
the
reserves
without
pay.
mr.
david
goldfarb
without
pay
of
any
kind.
mr.
david
goldfarb
i
do
not
know
whether
the
national
guard
was
paid
or
not
at
that
time.
mr.
david
goldfarb
i
believe
it
is
not
completely
clear.
mr.
david
goldfarb
but
they
do
say
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
if
they
adopted
the
army’s
construction,
and
therefore
they
put
in
the
sentence
--
and
we
have
it
in
our
brief,
page
16
at
footnote
8,
"we"
--
mr.
david
goldfarb
right.
mr.
david
goldfarb
right.
mr.
david
goldfarb
yes.
mr.
david
goldfarb
well,
i
guess
they
felt
that
the
statutory
construction
would
be
enough;
but
i
think
they
explained
...
possibly,
they
are
explaining
their
reason
that
if
you
do
not
reach
the
statutory
construction,
you
would
have
to
reach
to
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
david
goldfarb
"as
applied",
as
applied
by
the
army.
mr.
david
goldfarb
right,
but
they
do
not
say
whether
--
mr.
david
goldfarb
yes.
mr.
david
goldfarb
that
way.
mr.
david
goldfarb
but
they
say
the
government
has,
and
the
government
has
applied
it.
mr.
david
goldfarb
okay.
mr.
david
goldfarb
if
the
statute
does
not
bar,
for
either
reason,
our
client,
i
think
it
automatically
follows
that
the
government
has
to
pay.
mr.
david
goldfarb
i
think
in
either
case,
if
that
proviso
is
either
construed
to
include
our
client
because
he
was
only
credit
they
were
talking
about
or
the
proviso
was
stuck
down
as
being
unconstitutional
and
is
no
longer
a
bar,
in
either
case
retirement
benefits
would
have
be
paid
and
because
--
mr.
david
goldfarb
well,
i
think
the
problem
is
there
that
the
court
would
only
declare
the
proviso
unconstitutional.
mr.
david
goldfarb
because
i
think
we
have
--
mr.
david
goldfarb
well,
the
thing
is
that
we
have
the
legislative
history
here,
which
shows
the
purpose
of
the
entire
statute,
which
was
to
confer
this
benefit
on
people
with
20
measurable
years.
mr.
david
goldfarb
the
problem
is
that
the
words
of
the
statute
do
not
carry
out
that
purpose.
mr.
david
goldfarb
well,
no,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
they
are
not
discouraging
everyone
with
no
wartime
service,
but
only
one
class
of
people.
mr.
david
goldfarb
well,
first
of
all,
we
feel
that
--
mr.
david
goldfarb
we
feel
that
it
would
not
have
a
--
that
this
proviso
would
not
fit
in
with
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
which
was
to
encourage
--
mr.
david
goldfarb
well,
our
feeling
is
--
mr.
david
goldfarb
but
our
feeling
is
that
the
way
this
statute
works,
it
creates
an
impermissible
classification,
because
there
is
no
rational
reason
to
discriminate
between
the
man
--
mr.
david
goldfarb
it
would
be
an
irrational
purpose
and
against
the
purpose
...
the
purpose
of
this
one
subsection,
then,
would
be
working
against
the
purpose
of
the
whole
statute,
and
we
feel
it
would
be
still
unconstitutional.
mr.
david
goldfarb
yes,
but
i
think
when
you
have
a
purpose
of
a
small
subsection,
which
is
on
head-on
collision
with
the
purpose
of
the
entire
section,
you
have
to
look
to
the
purpose
of
the
entire
section.
ad
secondly,
the
problem
here
is
that
--
mr.
david
goldfarb
it
was
unconstitutional
to
make
this
kind
of
irrational
classification
between
two
groups
of
men
and
with
no
basis
for
having
one
that
would
stay
in
and
one
that
would
not
stay
in,
the
two
groups
of
men
being
the
two
that
came
in
1947
and
served
their
20
years,
and
just
because
one
had
seven
prior
years
--
mr.
david
goldfarb
well,
as
i
said
at
first,
we
do
not
feel
that
this
was
...
there
is
no
legislative
evidence
that
they
were
trying
to
discourage
or
penalize
any
group
of
people.
mr.
david
goldfarb
well,
that
was
a
very
small
part
of
the
testimony
among
lots
of
other
purposes.
mr.
david
goldfarb
i
think
there
appears
to
be
a
purpose,
a
benign
purpose,
to
give
a
retirement
benefit
to
those
who
had
served
on
active
wartime
duty
and
to
include
that
along
with
the
rest
of
the
act.
mr.
david
goldfarb
that
would
be
the
-–
the
finding
of
the
courts
below
in
his
case
was
that
he
was
not
able
to
participate
in
the
war.
mr.
david
goldfarb
this
man,
according
to
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
court
below,
was
a
victim
of
a
car
accident
in
approximately
the
time
he
dropped
out
of
the
reserves
and
had
not
sufficiently
recovered
to
be
in
reserves
at
the
time
of
the
war.
mr.
david
goldfarb
right,
and
in
1940
he
was
in
a
serious
accident.
mr.
david
goldfarb
it
was
a
finding
of
fact
of
the
court
below.
mr.
david
goldfarb
if
i
recall,
the
questions
on
oral
argument.
mr.
david
goldfarb
no.
mr.
david
goldfarb
right,
it
does
not
affect
the
class.
mr.
david
goldfarb
and
i
think
our
point
which
we
feel
is
important
on
that
is
that
there
were
people
who
also
did
not
have
prior
wartime
service
who
came
in
in
'47
or
'45
for
the
first
--
after
august
16,
1945
for
the
first
time
were
not
even
required
to
serve
in
the
korean
war
and
could
get
the
benefit
of
the
statute.
mr.
david
goldfarb
not
necessarily.
mr.
david
goldfarb
no,
many
of
them,
in
fact,
were
not,
because
they
came
in
in
relation
to
needing
the
job
because
they
were
merchant
marines
or
because
they
had
another
civilian
job
which
required
them
to
be
in
the
reserves.
mr.
david
goldfarb
i
mentioned
that
they
put
no
age
limit
on
it
other
than
--
mr.
david
goldfarb
no.
in
order
to
--
he
has
a
retired
--
there
is
a
mandatory
retirement
at
60,
and
in
order
to
get
your
20
years
in,
you
would
have
to
come
in
before
you
are
40.
mr.
david
goldfarb
it
is
not
my
understanding
that
there
is
an
age
limit
other
than
the
mandatory
retirement
age
at
age
60,
and
you
have
to
reenlist,
i
think,
every
5
years;
so
mr.
fioto’s
last
period
of
enlistment
was
between
the
ages
of
55
and
60.
mr.
david
goldfarb
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
goldfarb
when
the
statute
was
created,
they
created
the
measurement
of
what
is
a
good
year
of
service.
mr.
david
goldfarb
they
decided
that
since
there
was
no
point
system
before
'48,
they
would
give
people
credit
for
the
years
before
'48
if
they
had
active
wartime
duty.
mr.
david
goldfarb
that
is
because
there
was
no
way
to
measure
the
other
service
other
than
whether
or
not
you
were
in
active
wartime
duty.
mr.
david
goldfarb
no,
they
said
that
we
can
measure
years
after
'48.
mr.
david
goldfarb
okay.
mr.
david
goldfarb
i
think
it
was
a
purpose
to
say,
we
are
going
to
give
them
a
benefit
of
the
doubt,
that
we
are
going
to
give
a
benign
--
mr.
david
goldfarb
that
the
service
before
'48
was
definitely
good
enough
to
qualify.
mr.
david
goldfarb
it
could
be,
yes.
mr.
david
goldfarb
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
evident
from
the
legislative
history.
mr.
david
goldfarb
the
congress,
in
passing
the
legislation
in
1948
in
the
senate
hearings,
said
they
wanted
to
create
a
uniform
system
among
all
the
branches
of
the
service,
and
they
created
the
point
system
and
they
said
that
they
did
not
want
to
leave
it
up
to
the
branches
of
the
service
where
the
navy
would
make
one
system
and
the
army
make
another
system
and
they
would
evaluate.
mr.
david
goldfarb
the
congressional
hearings
are
blind
to
that.
mr.
david
goldfarb
right,
all
the
branches
of
service
then,
and
they
felt
that
this
was
significant,
that
they
would
not
be
--
mr.
david
goldfarb
they
gave
that
as
a
benefit
sort
of;
so
as
not
to
penalize
them
in
a
sense,
they
gave
that
to
them
as
an
additional
benefit,
because
they
said
we
cannot
measure
those
years,
we
will
take
this
as
the
criteria.
mr.
david
goldfarb
yes,
because
i
think
the
only
--
mr.
david
goldfarb
there
were
no
records,
i
think
they
gave
that
because
there
was
no
other
system.
mr.
david
goldfarb
no,
they
just
gave
that.
