justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
that
this
evidence
was
ignored
by
both
the
district
court
and
by
the
court
of
appeals,
was
it
ignored
to
the
extent
that
they
found
otherwise?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
was
judge
gordon’s
finding
at
his…
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
inference
is
that
if
the
plaintiff
had
given
him
such
a
finding
to
sign,
he
would
have
signed
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
judge
gordon
is
sitting
at
the
trial,
in
fact,
he
is
free
to
disbelieve
any
expert
he
wants
to.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
can
just
believe
the
testimony
of
the
plaintiff’s
witnesses
even
and
find
it
more
–
affect
more
favorably
to
the
plaintiff
than
the
plaintiff’s
witnesses
if
there
is
other
evidence
to
support
it,
can
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
in
order
to
make
a
finding
of
facts
that
the
district
court
not
only
has
to
find
the
fact,
but
has
to
say
i
disbelieve
what
is
stated
by
the
contrary?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
findings
of
the
district
court
are
silent
on
this
point?
