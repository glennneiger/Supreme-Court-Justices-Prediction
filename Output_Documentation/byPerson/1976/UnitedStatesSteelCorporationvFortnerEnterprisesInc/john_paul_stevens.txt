mr.
flinn,
before
you
do
that,
is
it
not
correct
that
there
was
also
at
least
representing
opinion
to
an
additional
item
approved,
namely
the
fact
that
there
were
other
times
between
your
credit
division
and
other
purchases
of
homes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
not
evidence
that
a
certain
percentage
and
i
do
not
remember
the
figure
now
of
your
credit
companyâ€™s
loans
did
have
a
tie-in
feature
with
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
point,
just
so
i
have
clear
mind,
the
customer
acceptance
feature
of
the
proof
is
the
same
whether
it
is
this
customer
or
this
customer
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
flinn,
let
me
just
interrupt.
did
you
said
the
evidence
is
the
contrary,
but
did
not
the
judge
find
that
they
are
$455
more
expensive
and
the
witness
so
testified,
so
we
got
its
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
the
(inaudible)
that
many.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
must
have
misunderstood
your
argument,
because
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
even
if
he
paid
more
for
the
houses
and
knew
it,
it
really
would
not
make
any
difference
as
long
as
the
total
package
was
what
the
free
market
would
dictate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
united
states
against
fortner
is
anti-trust
case.
the
respondent
is
a
real
estate
developer.
he
borrowed
money
from
a
subsidiary
of
united
states
steel
corporation
to
finance
a
residential
real
estate
development.
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
loan
was
that
the
respondent
by
pre-fabricated
houses
for
the
development
from
u.s.
steel.
difficulties
arose
while
the
development
was
in
progress
and
respondent
filed
this
anti-trust
suit.
in
1969,
this
court
held
that
this
arrangement
would
violate
the
anti-trust
laws
if
you
u.s.
steel
was
exploiting
economic
power
in
the
credit
market
in
order
to
make
house
sales.
the
case
was
remanded
for
a
trial
on
the
issue
whether
u.s.
steel
had
economic
power
over
credit.
we
now
conclude
that
evidence
produced
at
the
subsequent
trial
failed
to
established
the
existence
of
the
kind
of
economic
power
that
plaintiff
was
required
to
prove
in
order
to
recover
damages.
instead
of
showing
that
u.s.
steel
was
exploiting
some
kind
of
advantage
over
its
competitors
in
the
credit
market,
the
evidence
showed
only
that
it
was
willing
to
accept
a
lower
profit
in
order
to
take
greater
risks
making
loans
that
its
competitors.
since
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
erroneously
held
that
respondent
had
proved
the
existence
of
economic
power
over
credit,
we
anonymously
reversed
that
court's
judgment.
the
chief
justice
joined
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
while
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court,
has
filed
a
brief
concurring
opinion.
