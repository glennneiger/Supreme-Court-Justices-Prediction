mr.
macdonald
flinn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
antitrust
action
is
before
this
court
for
the
second
time
on
writ
of
certiorari
directed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
in
1969,
in
a
five
to
four
decision,
this
court
reversed
a
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
present
petitioners
who
are
the
defendants
below.
at
the
trial
which
followed
in
the
western
district
of
kentucky,
a
verdict
was
directed
for
the
plaintiff
on
the
liability
issues.
the
jury
found
damages
in
the
amount
of
some
$93,000
before
trebling
and
before
the
addition
of
counsel
fees
and
costs.
upon
appeal
from
that
first
trial,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
holding
that
while
the
plaintiff
had
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
sherman
act
violations,
nevertheless
there
were
material
facts
in
dispute
and
the
liability
issues
as
well
as
the
damage
issues
should
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury.
upon
remand
at
the
second
trial,
however,
both
sides
agreed
to
wave
the
jury.
following
that
second
trial,
the
trial
judge
signed
a
photocopy
of
the
plaintiff’s
proposed
findings
and
conclusions.
in
adopting
those
conclusions,
he
held
that
the
defendants
had
violated
both
sections
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act.
upon
the
appeal
from
that
second
trial,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
holding
that
the
plaintiff
had
in
fact
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
a
proceed
time
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act,
and
that
the
findings
adopted
by
the
trial
judge
below
were
not
clearly
erroneous.
as
the
plaintiff
urged,
however,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded,
that
having
reach
the
results
that
it
did
with
regard
to
the
section
1
findings,
it
was
unnecessary
on
the
appeal
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
section
2
finding
of
conspiracy
to
monopolize
could
be
sustained.
it
is
with
the
case
in
that
posture
that
this
court
has
granted
certiorari.
the
plaintiff,
fortner
enterprises
is
a
corporation
owned
by
mr.
a.
b.
fortner,
a
successful
louisville
realtor.
the
defendants
are
us
steel,
which
through
its
homes
division
sold
prefabricated
houses
and
it
is
wholly
owned
finance
subsidiary,
us
steel
homes
credit
corporation
which
confined
its
financing
services
to
promoting
the
sale
of
homes
division
houses.
by
written
agreements
executed
in
the
first
instance
in
october
1960,
and
again
in
august
1961,
mr.
fortner
negotiated
with
the
credit
corporation,
certain
land
loans
covering
the
acquisition
and
development
of
two
neighboring
parcels
of
land
and
a
subdivision
owned
by
another
of
mr.
fortner’s
corporations
viroqua
(ph)
development.
this
financing
was
conditioned
upon
the
agreement
by
the
plaintiff
to
buy
and
construct
a
homes
division,
prefabricated
house
on
each
of
the
lots
unless
the
underlying
loans
were
repaid.
the
amount
committed
under
these
loan
agreements
was
100%
of
the
cost
at
which
mr.
fortner
transferred
the
lots
from
one
corporation
to
the
other,
plus
the
cost
of
development
of
some
150
lots
which
were
involved
in
the
first
transaction
and
which
were
not
fully
developed
at
that
time.
mr.
fortner
testified
that
he
would
not
have
purchased
the
defendant’s
houses
without
this
land
financing
which
is
the
challenged
subject
in
this
lawsuit.
mr.
fortner
also
testified
that
only
when
the
defendants
had
finally
accepted
his
terms
during
extensive
negotiations,
did
he
agree
to
enter
into
this
arrangement.
fortner
contends
both
below
and
here
that
this
land
financing,
conditioned
upon
the
purchase
of
the
prefabricated
houses
was
a
per
se
time
violation
in
that
the
loans
were
allegedly
unique,
because
100%
loans
on
equally
favorable,
equally
cheap
terms
were
not
available
at
that
time
from
traditional
louisville
lending
sources.
more
specifically,
mr.
fortner
and
other
witnesses
testified
that
to
the
best
of
their
knowledge,
100%
loans
were
not
available
from
conventional
lenders
in
louisville
at
the
particular
time
they
entered
into
these
two
transactions
with
the
defendants.
but
as
the
court
of
appeals
noted,
soon
after
the
plaintiff
had
negotiated
its
100%
terms
with
the
defendants,
conventional
louisville
lending
agencies
did
in
fact
begin
to
grant
100%
land
loans.
in
fact,
it
is
undisputed
on
this
record
that
within
less
than
a
year
of
the
second
loan
agreement,
in
response
not
only
to
the
alleged
terms
which
the
credit
corporation
granted
to
the
plaintiff
here,
but
also
in
response
to
100%
loans
by
other
prefabricated
house
manufacturers,
the
traditional
louisville
lending
agencies
were
indeed
making
100%
land
loans.
we
contend
that
fortner
has
failed
to
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
the
requisite
economic
power
over
credit
in
order
to
establish
a
per
se
time
violation.
in
holding
to
the
contrary,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
courts
below
have
failed
to
follow
the
mandate
laid
down
by
this
court.
the
court
of
appeals,
on
the
most
recent
appeal,
held
that
even
though
fortner
had
failed
to
prove
that
other
lenders
were
in
anyway
prevented
from
making
equally
favorable
or
cheap
loans,
none
the
less
the
requisite
economic
power
over
credit
could
be
and
was
held
to
be
in
this
case
established
by
solely
three
elements
of
proof.
first,
that
the
loans
were
allegedly
cheaper
or
more
favorable
than
available
at
that
time
from
other
sources
in
louisville.
second,
based
upon
the
opinion
testimony
of
fortner’s
construction
superintendent
that
the
tied
product
price,
the
price
of
the
houses
charged
by
the
defendants
was
allegedly
higher
than
the
price
for
a
comparable
conventional
house,
and
finally
mere
acceptance
of
this
tying
condition
in
those
circumstances.
i
would
turn
now
to
what
the
petitioners
believe
this
court
held
was
necessary
to
establish
economic
power
over
credit.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
believe
that
as
correct.
i
intended
to
subsume
that
holding
by
the
court
in
my
statement
of
the
third
element,
customer
acceptance.
the
plaintiff
has
contended
that
uniquely
favorable
loans
were
extended
by
the
credit
corporation
to
other
borrowers.
we
urge
that
there
are
absolutely
no
evidences
or
the
records
of
the
terms
or
conditions
on
which
loans
were
made
by
the
credit
corporation
to
any
other
borrower.
we
contended
that
there
is
nothing
that
shows
that
loans
to
any
other
borrower
on
land
financing
were
especially
unique
in
the
sense,
that
equally
favorable
terms
were
not
available
from
other
conventional…
mr.
macdonald
flinn
the
plaintiff
has
i
think
taken
the
evidence
out
of
record.
we
have
treated
this
point
in
some
detail
in
the
appendix
and
the
reason
that
we
have
put
it
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief
mr.
justice,
is
because
we
are
prepared
to
stand
on
our
argument
today
whether
or
not
other
customers
acquiesced
in
tie-in
arrangements
under
uniquely
favorable
loan
terms.
our
argument
is
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
the
result
is
the
same
for
reasons
which
i
will
go
into
in
my
argument,
but
we
do
take
factual
issue
with
the
state
of
the
record
and
have
detailed
the
record
in
that.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
is
my
argument
today,
yes
sir.
unlike
a
tie-in
product
which
is
unique
or
distinctive
and
commands
a
higher
price
or
a
premium
price
thereby
yielding
an
abnormally
high
profit
to
the
seller,
credit
or
financing
by
contrasts
is
the
most
fungible
of
all
commodities.
$1
is
no
different
than
any
other
dollar
and
no
lender
can
long
command
a
higher
price
or
more
owners
or
costly
terms
for
selling
his
credit
or
his
financing
services
than
other
lenders
are
asking.
in
recognition
to
that
fact,
this
court,
both
the
majority
and
the
dissenting
justices
stated
that
the
only
thing
that
can
be
unique
about
a
loan
or
financing
is
that
it
is
offered
on
cheaper
or
more
favorable
terms
than
other
lenders
are
offering
at
the
particular
moment.
indeed,
such
cheaper
offering
of
terms
is
the
very
crux,
the
very
essence
of
competition
among
lenders.
in
recognition
to
that
fact
and
in
keeping
with
that
desirable
competitive
objective,
again,
both
the
majority
and
dissenting
justices
of
this
court
rejected
fortner’s
argument
that
economic
power
over
credit
can
be
established
solely
by
the
fact
that
the
terms
offered
are
cheaper
or
more
favorable
than
available
elsewhere.
in
fact,
both
the
majority
and
dissenting
justices
recognized
that
without
any
economic
power
over
credit,
a
lender
can
decide
to
offer
more
favorable
terms
in
order
to
promote
the
sale
of
an
ancillary
or
tied
product.
such
a
lender
may
simply
decide
to
give
up
some
or
all
of
the
profit
which
other
lenders
are
making
on
the
terms
that
they
ask.
as
justice
black
stated
for
the
majority,
a
seller
who
lacks
economic
power
in
the
credit
market
can
lawfully
offer
advantageous
terms
on
credit
as
a
means
of
promoting
the
sale
of
his
tied
product,
thereby
in
effect
reducing
the
price
of
the
tied
product,
engaging
in
price
competition
in
the
tied
product
market.
in
short,
this
court
concluded
that
cheaper,
more
favorable
terms
for
credit
neither
prove
nor
disprove
the
existence
of
economic
power.
they
merely
pose
the
decisive
question
which
must
then
be
answered
if
in
fact,
the
loan
terms
were
cheaper
or
more
favorable
than
available
elsewhere,
were
they
cheaper
because
the
defendants
had
some
unique
economic
ability,
some
unique
competitive
advantage
which
precluded
other
lenders
from
offering
equally
favorable
terms
on
a
profitable
basis.
the
issue
mandated
by
this
court,
therefore,
was
not
whether
equally
cheap
financing
was
merely
unavailable
from
other
lenders
at
that
particular
time.
rather
as
the
majority
held,
unless
other
lenders
were
legally
barred
from
offering
100%
loan
terms,
the
issue
then
is
whether
in
the
words
of
justice
black,
the
defendants
had
a
unique
economic
ability
to
provide
100%
financing
at
cheap
rates
because
they
had
some
cost
advantage
or
economies
of
scale
in
their
credit
operations,
so
that
other
lenders
could
not
profitably
lend
money
on
the
risks
involved.
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
itself
to
these
factual
issues.
it
correctly
concluded
that
there
was
no
such
proof
in
this
trial
record.
many
lenders
were
legally
free
not
subject
to
any
probations
upon
making
100%
land
loans.
similarly,
fortner
offered
no
evidence
that
the
defendants
had
any
cost
advantage
or
economies
of
scale
arising
out
of
their
operations
in
the
credit
market.
instead,
the
record
shows
affirmatively
that
the
defendants
operated
at
a
cost
disadvantage
and
realized
a
lower
rate
of
profit
than
conventional
lenders
did.
in
fact,
what
the
courts
below
found
was
that
conventional
lenders
were
not
making
100%
loans
at
the
time
of
these
transactions
only
because
they
were
unwilling
to
take
the
risk
of
lower
profits.
now,
as
proof
of
economic
power
as
i
indicated
a
moment
ago,
both
of
the
lower
courts
relied
upon
the
evidence
of
the
allegedly
cheaper
more
favorable
loan
terms
which
are
challenged
here,
coupled
with
the
allegedly
higher
price
for
the
tied
product,
the
houses
and
customer
acceptance
of
that
tie-in
arrangement
in
those
circumstances.
we
urge
that
even
if
these
facts
were
submitted
or
supported
by
the
record,
they
are
not
proof
of
power
over
credit.
reduced
to
their
lowest
common
denominator,
they
are
at
most
consistent
with
or
tend
to
support
the
claim
that
the
terms
on
which
the
loans
were
offered
were
in
fact
cheaper
or
more
favorable.
proof
of
cheaper
terms,
however,
as
this
court
held
does
not
prove
that
the
defendants
had
any
unique
ability
to
offer
loans
on
such
terms.
it
does
not
prove
that
other
lenders
were
precluded
in
any
way
in
matching
those
terms.
where
the
tie-in
element
is
offered
at
a
cheaper
price,
buyers
will
inevitably
be
attracted
by
that
fact,
particularly
is
that
true
where
the
tie-in
element
is
fungible,
such
as
money
because
no
borrower,
as
we
have
noted,
will
pay
other
lenders
a
high
price
than
he
can
obtain
from
some
other
lender.
in
those
circumstances,
we
urge
that
acceptance
of
the
tie-in
condition,
even
by
numerous
customers,
attracted
by
the
allegedly
lower
price
of
the
financing,
is
at
most
evidence
that
the
credit
terms
were
in
fact
cheaper
or
more
favorable.
it
is
not
evidence
of
economic
power.
similarly,
i
assume
that
mr.
fortner
had
believed
that
defendant’s
houses
were
over
priced
or
otherwise
non
competitive
at
the
time
he
negotiated
the
loan
arrangements
which
are
now
challenged.
i
would
note
that
the
evidence
is
to
the
contrary.
mr.
fortner’s
disenchantment
with
the
houses
appears
to
have
occurred
many
months
after
he
had
negotiated,
requested
and
entered
into
the
second
loan
arrangement
but…
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i
agree,
i
did
not
mean
to
say
that
there
was
not
a
finding
that
the
houses
were
higher
priced.
i
meant
to
say
there
is
no
evidence
that
mr.
fortner
was
in
anyway
disenchanted
with
the
houses,
deem
them
higher
price...
mr.
macdonald
flinn
it
makes
a
great
deal
with
difference
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
believe
that
if
at
the
time
a
buyer
who
enters
into
a
tie-in
arrangement,
knowingly
takes
a
product
which
he
does
not
want,
knowingly
takes
a
product
which
is
he
believes
is
over
priced,
knowingly
takes
a
product
which
he
deems
non
competitive
on
any
other
basis,
it
can
then
be
urged
that
on
an
inference
that
he
has
been
economically
coerced
by
some
uniquely
attractive
singularly
compelling
aspect
to
the
tie-in
element
and
an
inference
of
the
economic
power
might
be
drawn
from
that.
now,
i
am
saying
first
of
all
in
this
case,
the
evidence
shows
affirmatively
though
no
finding
was
made
on
this
one
way
or
the
other
that
at
the
time,
mr.
fortner
solicited
and
negotiated
not
one
but
two
financing
arrangements.
he
was
in
no
way
convinced
that
the
houses
were
anything
other
than
supportive,
indeed
as
much
as
six
months
after
the
second
loan
arrangement,
he
stated
in
a
letter
that
his
principal
competitor,
mr.
swindler,
who
had
houses
comparable
to
his,
he
was
sure
anybody
who
would
look
at
the
two
houses
would
conclude
that
his
us
steel
houses
were
both
cheaper
and
better.
i
submit
mr.
swindler
in
order
to
survive
in
the
real
estate
business
notwithstanding
that
unhappy
name,
must
have
had
very
good
houses
at
very
low
prices,
and
i
think
that
mr.
fortner’s
own
characterization
suggests
that
it
was
not
until
long
after
he
had
negotiated
the
loan
agreements
that
he
deemed
these
houses
to
be
in
anyway
defective
or
overpriced.
my
point
is
solely
that
no
inference
of
economic
power
can
be
drawn
from
any
disenchantment
with
the
houses,
since
that
disenchantment
did
not
arise
until
after
the
loan
arrangements
had
been
negotiated
but
in…
mr.
macdonald
flinn
that
is
the
second
part
of
my
argument,
mr.
justice
stevens
that
even
if,
at
the
time,
he
entered
into
the
loan
arrangements,
mr.
fortner
deemed
the
house
overpriced
or
in
any
other
way
noncompetitive,
he
would
in
the
circumstances
of
this
kind
of
tie-in
situations,
have
agreed
to
accept
that
burden
of
the
tied
product
only
if
he
concluded
that
the
saving
on
the
allegedly
cheaper
more
favorable
tie-in
element,
the
loans
at
least
compensated
for
that
burden
that
he
was
assuming.
now,
alternatively
where
the
tie-in
element
is
allegedly
unique
because
offered
on
more
favorable
or
cheaper
terms
than
available
elsewhere,
the
only
way
that
a
customer
knowingly
accepting
the
tie-in
arrangement
and
knowingly
accepting
a
higher
priced
tied
product
could
evidence
economic
power
would
be
if
the
premium
or
the
over
charge
on
the
tied
product,
the
houses
exceeded
the
saving
on
the
tie-in
element
and
the
evidence
is
devoid
of
any
such
evidence.
it
is
directly
devoid
of
any
such
evidence
and
i
believe
that
the
plaintiff
makes
no
claims
along
those
lines.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
even
after
two
trials,
there
is
no
evidence
here
that
traditional
lenders
were
ever
prevented
by
a
cost
disadvantage,
legal
obstacle
or
otherwise
from
making
100%
loans
at
a
profit.
nevertheless
ignoring
this
court’s
mandate,
we
urge
the
court
of
appeals
held
as
i
have
noted
previously,
that
fortner
could
prevail
even
though
it
failed
to
show
that
other
lenders
were
unable
to
make
comparable
loans.
we
submit
that
the
absence
of
such
evidence
by
itself
is
sufficient
to
destroy
fortner’s
per
se
tie-in
claim
in
view
of
this
court’s
mandate
on
the
prior
review
of
this
case.
moreover,
there
is
affirmative
proof
in
the
record
that
other
lenders
were
not
prevented
from
making
equally
favorable
100%
loans.
as
i
have
mentioned
before,
even
though
it
was
ignored
by
both
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
the
evidence
is
undisputed,
that
traditional
lending
agencies
within
a
very
few
months
began
making
100%
land
loans.
the
court
of
appeals
incidentally
in
its
first
opinion
had
correctly
concluded
that
that
evidence
was
relevant
to
deciding
whether
other
lenders
were
free
and
able
to
make
100%
loans.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
no,
there
is
no
contrary
finding
and
it
was
ignored
mr.
justice
rehnquist
by
the
court
of
appeals
only
in
its
second
opinion.
in
our
brief,
we
have
cited
to
the
portion
of
the
record,
where
in
the
first
court
of
appeals
opinion,
they
specifically
adverted
to
the
fact
that
there
was
no
question,
but
that
other
conventional
lenders
began
making
100%
loans
shortly
after
fortner
negotiated
his
transactions
with
the
defenders.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
no
finding
one
way
or
the
other.
the
plaintiff
did
not
give
him
such
a
finding
to
sign.
we
did,
it
was
rejected.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i
cannot
speculate
to
that
mr.
justice.
i
am
saying
the
state
of
the
record,
however,
is
clear
that
other
lenders
did
begin
making
these
loans
and
indeed
even
the
plaintiff’s
expert
witness,
professor
masten
from
university
of
georgia
testified
that
this
became
pretty
much
a
general
thing,
although
his
testimony
as
that
of
the
other
witnesses
was
that
at
the
specific
time,
the
particular
time
of
these
loan
transactions,
he
did
not
believe
that
other
louisville
lenders
were
making
100%
loans.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
this
happened
to
be
the
testimony
of
the
plaintiff’s
witnesses.
all
of
the
evidence
is…
mr.
macdonald
flinn
the
trial
judge,
however
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
predicated
none
of
his
findings
upon
credibility,
none
of
his
findings
upon
disbelieving
any
of
the
witnesses,
none
of
his
findings
upon
disallowing
any
of
the
evidence
that
was
in
the
record.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
no,
i
am
not.
i
am
saying
that
in
all
the
facts
and
in
the
procedure
of
this
case,
i
submit
that
this
is
one
of
those
cases
where
this
court
as
any
appellate
court
is
free
to
look
at
facts
which
are
not
in
dispute
on
the
record
even
though
they
have
not
been
found
by
the
trial
judge,
but
let
me
say
this,
even
without
this
particular
fact,
my
legal
argument
remains
the
same.
i
am
saying
that
there
was
affirmative
evidence
that
other
lenders
were
able
to
make
100%
loans.
i
believe
that
all
i
have
to
do
to
sustain
my
argument
that
the
plaintiff
has
failed
to
make
a
prima
facie
case
is
show
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
other
lenders
were
prevented
from
making
100%
loans.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
yes
sir.
however,
the
first
opinion
of
the
sixth
circuit
is
not
silent
on
this
point.
as
i
also
noted,
the
courts
below
concluded
that
conventional
louisville
lenders
were
not
making
100%
loans
earlier
only
because
of
their
unwillingness
to
take
the
risk
involved
or
indeed
as
fortner
conceded
in
his
brief
before
the
court
of
appeals,
because
such
conventional
lenders
would
not
take
the
chance
if
the
loan
is
not
being
profitable.
we
urge
that
the
fact
that
competing
lenders
simply
chose
not
to
run
the
risk
of
lower
profit
until
stimulated
by
competition
to
do
so,
demonstrate
that
they
have
the
ability
to
offer
100%
loans
like
those
allegedly
given
by
the
defendants.
in
conclusion,
we
would
ask
the
court
to
consider
the
competitive
consequences
of
fortner’s
position
adopted
by
the
courts
below
that
economic
power
over
credit
is
shown
where
equally
favorable
terms
are
merely
unavailable
and
simply
because
other
lenders
choose
not
to
run
the
risk
of
lower
profit,
that
proposition
would
mean
that
the
innovator
who
pioneers
lower
credit
terms
to
promote
the
accompanying
sale
of
a
product
violates
the
antitrust
laws
even
though
his
competition
stimulates
other
lenders
to
lower
their
prices
for
financing,
a
wholly
desirable,
laudable
antitrust
and
competitive
objective.
to
sanction
that
position,
we
respectfully
submit
is
simply
to
stand
the
sherman
act
on
its
head.
thank
you
very
much
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
add
up
only
one
thing.
these
loans
were
not
$2
million
for
the
financing
of
land.
there
is
a
challenge
interposed
by
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
only
to
the
land
financing.
the
two
land
financing
transactions
together
totaled
less
than
$380,000.
so
i
submit
that
on
the
record
its
clear
even
on
the
findings
adopted
by
judge
gordon
it
is
clear,
us
steel
did
not
use
$2.2
million
worth
of
its
assets
to
promote
the
sale
of
what
turned
out
to
be
70
prefabricated
houses
to
this
plaintiff.
thank
you.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
they
were
spread
over
roughly
a
five-year
period
according
to
the
face
of
the
particular
exhibit.
that
exhibit
is
dated
in
late
1962,
it
picks
up
loan
commitments
not
even
loans
made
mr.
justice,
but
commitments
made
as
early
as
1958.
these
two
loans
that
are
listed
on
that
particular
document
for
fortner
enterprises
show
that
the
other
listings
were
commitments
rather
than
amounts
actually
loaned
because
of
the
record
here
clearly
demonstrates
mr.
fortner
did
not
take
down
full
amount
of
the
$380,000
land
loans
committed
to
him.
he
gave
up
his
project
before
the
development
had
run
its
course.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i
am
sure
the
record
does
show
that.
no
land
financing
was
extended
other
than
on
the
basis
that
each
lot
would
have
a
homes
division
house
built
upon
it.
so
we
raised
no
issue
about
that.
we
do,
however,
point
out
that
the
$19
million
loan
which
my
friend
mr.
anderson
says
was
the
tie
is
erroneous
of
that
19
million,
some
$13
or
$14
million
was
for
the
purchase
of
the
houses
themselves.
those
were
not
land
loans,
then
when
we
get
down
to
the
roughly
$5
million
of
land
loans
which
were
outstanding
in
one
of
the
two
years
when
these
loans
were
negotiated,
there
is
no
showing
on
the
record
is
that
how
many
of
those
were
special
land
loans
and
therefore
by
the
plaintiff's
argument
allegedly
unique
in
any
sense.
the
record
is
silent
on
those
facts.
