mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
court.
i
appear
here
today
for
the
second
time,
having
been
here
approximately
eight
years
ago
and
before
i
got
here,
my
client
asked
me
a
number
of
questions.
my
client
said
i
understood
that
the
supreme
court
had
established
the
basic
ground
rules
for
this
case
eight
years
ago,
did
they
not
and
i
said,
“yes,
i
thought
they
had.”
my
client
said,
“i
thought
we
tried
this
case
twice
and
had
fact
findings
in
our
favor,
did
we
not?”
and
i
had
to
answer,
yes,
we
did.
so
rhetorically
of
course
to
begin
with,
we
ask
why
are
we
here?
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
i
think
part
of
it,
we
have
to
blame
on
mr.
justice
white
your
honor
because
in
his
dissent,
his
interpretation
of
the
majority
opinion
was
in
affect
that
on
the
basis
of
the
record
that
we
had
if
there
were
no
countervailing
proof,
the
economic
power
issue
as
such
had
been
reduced.
mr.
justice
white
felt
to
a
relatively
simple
level
on
the
scale
of
things
and
that
basically
judge
gordon
at
the
close
of
our
30-day
trial
of
this
action,
felt
that
we
have
proved
not
only
all
of
the
evidence
which
was
in
the
record
before
this
court
at
that
time,
but
quite
a
bit
more
and
that
since
there
was
no
evidence
produced
by
united
states
steel
and
the
credit
corporation
who
rebutt
that
that
basically
the
prima
facie
case
that
judge
gordon
felt,
mr.
justice
black
had
delineated
in
this
court’s
opinion
had
been
and
had
not
been
properly
rebutted,
and
therefore,
he
sustained
the
motion
for
direct
verdict.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
all
of
these
matters
were
argued
ad
nauseum
before
judge
gordon
at
that
time,
your
honor.
now,
this
is
at
the
time
that
he
gave
the
directed
verdict.
one
of
the
very
interesting
things
about
this
is
that
what
you
have
heard
today
and
what
you
have
read
in
the
briefs,
are
great
deal,
are
mr.
flinn’s
and
his
covert
economic
theories
that
are
not
supported
by
the
record.
but
we
have
argued
this
case
and
we
argued
this
case
time
and
time
again
before
judge
gordon
in
the
intervening
eight
years
up
to
the
time
that
we
got
here
and
he
was
quite
familiar
in
great
depth
with
all
of
the
facts
and
all
of
the
evidence
that
had
been
established.
judge
gordon
was
not
impressed
at
all
with
the
very
meager
evidence
that
had
been
presented
for
example
about
the
subsequence
events,
involving
basically
the
lowable
mortgage
service
company
(ph)
and
its
president
testifying
that
on
a
few
occasions
they
had
from
their
own
company’s
money
made
some
100%
loans,
but
that
those
loans
were
not
similar
to
the
fortner’s
loans
with
which
he
was
familiar
and
very
importantly
those
loans
involved
personal
guarantees
by
principals
of
the
borrower
which
clearly
made
those
loans
distinguishable.
now,
the
only
other
testimony
mr.
flinn
refers
to
undisputed
evidence,
that
the
only
other
testimony
about
100%
loans
at
a
later
time
was
some
very
general
testimony,
that
was
not
pinpointed,
but
it
is
obvious
that
it
involves
loans
made
a
number
of
years
later
at
a
time
when
we
were
in
an
inflationary
spiral
and
in
circumstances
totally
different
than
those
which
existed
at
the
time
these
loans
remain.
the
only
expert
in
this
field
and
he
says,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out,
the
judge
gordon
was
free
to
ignore
or
accept
his
testimony,
but
the
only
competent
expert
who
testified
in
this
case
was
dr.
masten
who
had
been
with
the
university
of
kentucky,
who
at
the
time
of
our
last
trial
in
the
form
of
the
supplemental
evidence
that
we
presented
was
that
a
professor
of
banking
at
the
university
of
georgia
and
dr.
masten
laid
out
the
framework
of
the
economics
of
this
case
for
judge
gordon
and
of
course
to
judge
it
was
quite
obvious
at
the
trial
itself
when
dr.
masten
testified
that
judge
gordon
was
very
much
impressed
by
dr.
masten’s
testimony
which
buttressed
in
many
ways
the
arguments
that
we
had
previously
made
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
many
things
that
you
have
been
hearing
are
mr.
flinn’s
economic
theories.
we
give
back
to
basic
proposition
that
what
you
have
heard
today
involves
arguments
as
to
facts.
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out
in
any
earlier
argument
today,
normally
this
court
does
not
when
a
district
judge
acts
as
a
fact
finder,
make
fact
determinations
and
when
those
fact
determinations
have
been
affirmed
by
the
circuit
court,
this
court
does
not
go
behind
those.
basically
it
is
our
position
that
what
mr.
flinn
is
asking
you
to
do
is
to
go
behind
the
court’s
fact
findings.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
alright
sir.
first
of
all,
the
gist
of
petitioner’s
argument
is
that
this
court’s
1969
opinion
indicated
that
the
only
way
that
we
could
establish
economic
power
was
to
establish
that
the
credit
corporation
had
some
cost
advantage
in
what
is
described
as
the
credit
market.
i
would
respectfully
submit
to
start
out
with
that
and
they
rely
very
heavily
on
the
concept
of
fungibility
of
money.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
record
does
not
support
this
concept
of
fungibility
when
it
is
applied
to
loans.
this
court
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case
for
example,
pointed
out
that
money
is
the
raw
material
and
that
loans
are
the
finished
product.
so
we
start
out,
and
respectfully
submit,
with
the
basic
proposition
that
you
have
loans
on
particular
terms,
not
just
cheap
loans,
because
again,
i
submit
that
while
the
term,
‘cheap’
is
used,
we
are
talking
about
loans
that
are
on
particular
terms.
one
of
the
unique
aspects
of
the
loans
in
question
here
was
the
100%
aspect.
a
100%
of
the
cost
of
acquiring
the
land
and
of
developing
it
and
of
building
the
prefabricated
house
packages
that
were
bought
were
loans.
we
are
talking
about
$2,500,000
worth
of
loans
to
generate
purchases
of
house
packages
of
about
$700,000.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
these
loans
certainly
were
on,
it
depends
on
we
have
a
series
of
terms,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
they
were
more
favorable.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
i
think
that
it
is,
yes.
i
think
that
it
is
a
misnomer
to
transfer
more
favorable
into
cheaper
because
if
you
got
a
$2
million
loan
versus
a
$1.5
million
loan,
the
$2
million
loan
may
be
at
same
interest
rate
as
the
$1.5
million
loan,
but
the
$2
million
loan
in
certain
circumstances
may
be
more
favorable
and
that
is
exactly
the
situation
here.
the
volume
of
money
being
loaned
was
just
as
important
as
the
interest
rate
and
the
discount
rate.
the
interest
rate
was
comparable,
6%
at
that
time
was
comparable.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes
sir,
but
i
would
like
to
emphasize
favorable
as
opposed
to
cheap.
one
of
the
reasons
for
that
being
the
fact
that
in
most
instances
of
this
nature,
you
have
a
requirement
that
there
be
guarantees
of
the
loan
by
the
persons,
the
individuals
involved
in
the
procedure,
the
borrower,
mr.
fortner,
in
the
sense.
in
this
case,
you
have
something
entirely
different
which
created
again
a
more
favorable
situation.
you
have
united
steel…
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
my
position
is
that
a
favorable
interest
rate
can
be
one
of
the
factors
that
makes
a
loan
under
these
peculiar
types
of
circumstances
more
favorable,
but
there
are
many
other
circumstances
that
can
add
to
it,
that
could
even
create
a
situation
where
the
interest
rate
would
be
higher,
but
yet
would
make
the
loan
more
unique,
more
desirable
to
the
consumer
than
the
interest
rate,
than
the
cost
of
the
money,
depending
on
the
volume
of
the
money
that
is
involved,
and
the
circumstances
of
obtaining
it.
eliminating
the
personal
risk
is
a
very
important
factor.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes
sir,
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
put
so
much
emphasis.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
others
gave
a
100%
afterwards,
your
honor,
a
few
others
did
under
the
evidence,
but
under
conditions
where
a
personal
guarantees
were
required
by
the
principals
of
the
borrowers.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
no,
i
do
not
think
that
is
enough
of
it.
i
think
that
is
a
distinguishing
factor
as
between
the
loans
that
were
made
to
my
client
and
offered
to
my
client
and
my
client
was
sold
out
and
they
kept
asking
him
what
will
it
take
for
you
to
get
you
to
go
with
it
mr.
fortner
not
the…
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
it
could
get
to
that
your
honor
and
let
us
follow
that
up
a
little
bit.
if
you
have
someone
then
who
cuts
the
price
as
you
say
to
the
point
that
he
is
has
cut
the
price
of
his
loan
below
his
cost
then
regardless
how
he
got
at
the
level
of
the
cost
that
he
got
to,
if
he
is
cutting
the
effective
price
of
his
loan
below
that
cost
then
we
are
back
to
the
basic
proposition
or
this
is
a
parallel
to
a
creditory
type
action
on
his
part
he
has
created
for
himself,
economic
power.
just
as
the
man
with
the
widget
which
cost
him
a
dollar
to
produce,
if
he
decides
that
he
is
going
to
sell
his
widget
for
80
cents,
he
has
created
economic
power
for
himself.
this
is
exactly
what
happened
in
this
situation.
again
accepting
your
premise
that
however
you
cut
it,
the
combination
of
terms…
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
i
do
not
contend
that
as
such
they
were
below
cost.
the
us
steel
and
the
credit
corporation
has
contended
that
they
come
close
to
it,
but
my
point
is
they
got
themselves
down
to
a
level
where
economic
point,
the
competitors
at
that
time
and
the
economy
that
existed
at
that
time
were
simply
unwilling
because
of
risk
of
loss
to
make
such
loans,
to
offer
such
loans
to
people.
this
is
the
record,
this
is
what
is
in
the
record
in
this
case.
these
are
the
facts
in
this
case,
this
is
what
judge
gordon
adopted
as
a
binding
effect
and
i
submit
that
those
were
the
facts,
economically
and
factually.
the
problem
was
compounded
by
the
–
again,
in
talking
about
the
creation
of
economic
power,
the
problem
was
compounded
in
this
situation
by
the
fact
that
united
states
steel
itself
guaranteed
to
the
credit
corporation
the
loans
and
i
emphasize
that
we
have
two
different
separate
corporate
entities
in
this
case
not
willing
and
that
when
they
elected
to
operate
under
the
separate
corporate
entity
principals,
they
are
bound
by
that.
now,
in
this
situation,
united
states
steel
corporation
and
we
have
cited
the
figures
in
the
brief
with
its
vast
resources,
its
retained
earnings
that
it
had
in
its
kitty
to
use,
put
itself
again
in
the
same
type
situation
as
your
creditory
price
cut
in,
by
making
available
very
necessary
funds
from
other
sources
to
recompense
the
credit
corporation
if
it
got
into
trouble
in
a
particular
loan
such
as
it
did
with
fortner.
so
that
what
we
have
is
if
a
bank
were
making
a
loan
or
a
savings
and
loan
association
were
making
a
loan
to
a
developer
and
that
bank
or
savings
and
loan
association
said
development
loan
like
this,
$2,500,000
loan
said
to
that
developer,
“you
have
got
to
buy
united
state
steels’
prefabricated
houses.”
clearly
we
have
two
separate
entities,
we
have
the
tie
created
and
then,
okay,
so
united
states
steel
comes
back
and
says,
alright
mr.
bank,
i
will
guarantee
this
loan
to
ensure
achieving
the
tie.
this
is
the
very
principal
that
it
seems
to
me
the
antitrust
law
is
designed
to
prevent
because
we
are
not
talking
about
a
simple
credit
transaction,
a
simple
sale
of
a
product
on
a
differed
time
payment
basis.
we
are
talking
about
a
set
of
loans
under
particular
circumstances.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
the
purchase
of
the
houses.
yes
sir,
that
is
the
one
product
that
the
principal
alluded
to
in
mr.
justice
stewart’s
dissent
and
rather
in
mr.
justice
porter’s
dissent
in
which
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
and
this
was
one
of
the
fears
that
mr.
justice
white
had
in
his
dissent
that
this
type
of
transaction
would
be
the
simple
what
i
call
sale
of
the
product
on
credit
transaction
would
be
attacked
under
fortner.
this
is
not
proven
to
be
the
case
at
all.
we
do
not
have
a
series
of
cases
that
have
been
filed
over
the
last
eight
years,
applying
this
decision
in
that
fashion
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
they
are
entirely
different
situations.
here
we
have
got
the
credit
corporation
being
instructed
to
stand
or
to
commit
itself
to
spend
to
put
forward
$2.5
million
to
obtain
$700,000
worth
of
sales.
we
not
only
have
them
doing
it
with
us
and
again
this
–
they
all
did
not
even
had
to
be
100%
loans
to
be
attractive
to
people.
the
question
is
what
was
sufficient
as
their
own
documents
pointed
out
that
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief,
what
is
enough
they
said?
what
is
sufficient
to
do
the
job?
how
much
is
enough
to
get
you
to
take
our
product
and
in
some
instances,
it
may
have
been
80%,
in
some
instances
it
may
have
been
70%,
in
some
instances
it
may
have
been
90%
and
in
some
instances
it
may
be
a
100%,
but
we
do
know
this,
this
is
an
un-contradicted
fact
in
the
record,
and
is
found
by
the
court
that
all
the
loans
that
were
made,
i
mean,
all
of
the
loans
that
were
made
whether
under
the
special
financing
program
or
under
the
general
financing
program
of
us
steel
contains
a
tie-in
about
which
we
are
complaining
here
today
and
that
is
un-contradicted
in
the
record.
we
do
know
that
the
special
financing
program
which
is
described
by
their
own
documents
was
the
program
in
which
they
deliberately
set
out
to
attain
additional
sales
of
house
packages
and
we
do
know
that
there
were
43
loans
involving
the
special
terms
necessary
to
obtain
sales
in
situations
that
were
not
otherwise
generally
acceptable
and
of
those
43
loans
we
know
that
they
involved
$7,700,000
worth
of
loans,
again
involving
the
land
acquisition
and
development
aspects
only
of
this
situation.
so
it
can
be
seen
from
the
very
record
and
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
that
many,
many
other
ties
were
created
by
this
program
and
not
just
fortner.
fortner
happens
to
be
the
one
that
got
heard
in
his
complaining
but
there
were
many
others
that
were
affected
by
this
program
while
it
was
in
effect.
the
higher
price
for
the
product
is
as
established.
justice
black
in
the
majority
opinion
in
this
case
held
in
essence
that
this
is
evidence
for
the
finder
of
fact
to
consider;
the
finder
of
fact
considered
that
evidence
and
found
it
to
be
significant.
mr.
justice
black
said
of
these
other
factors
that
i
have
referred
to
were
evidence
to
be
considered.
i
did
not
read
this
court’s
opinion
as
a
saying
and
nor
has
the
sixth
circuit
in
either
of
its
opinions
where
this
court’s
opinion
as
saying
that
the
only
way
that
you
can
prove
market
power
in
the
lending
situation
is
to
prove
some
cost
advantage
on
the
part
of
the
lender,
because
and
i
think
if
you
analyze
it,
it
is
obvious
that
there
are
many
other
factors.
there
are
many
other
pieces
of
evidence
that
can
prove
that
economic
power
just
as
will
is
a
cost
advantage.
you
can
deliberately
do
something
and
create
an
advantage
for
yourself
and
as
mr.
justice
black
points
out
in
his
opinion,
where
a
large
company
has
tremendous
resources
behind
itself,
it
can
do
things
that
smaller
companies
that
do
not
have
these
tremendous
resources
behind
them
cannot
do
and
this
is
exactly
the
guarantee
program
that
i
described
in
my
argument
here.
they
were
able
to
underwrite
to
the
extent
necessary,
this
program
if
they
wanted
to
and
they
elected
to
do
so
from
funds
from
other
areas
of
their
business.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
that
is
correct
your
honor,
i
have
never
considered
the
supreme
court’s
decision
in
this
case
in
the
slightest
to
eliminate
the
requirement
of
proof
of
economic
power.
you
have
the
reference
and
the
opinion
to
the
various
factors
that
mr.
justice
black
in
writing
the
opinion
referred
to
as
being
indicia
of
economic
power
when
he
held
that
we
had
enough
proof
to
go
to
trial.
he
lists
in
various
manners
the
indicia,
of
some
indicia
of
economic
power.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
to
summarize
your
honor
i
think
that
mr.
justice
black
points
out
that…
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
alright,
yes
sir.
first
of
all
the
nature
of
the
terms
of
the
loans
are...
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
favorable
credit
terms
offer
your
honor
because…
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
right,
including
the
elimination
of
the
guarantees,
the
us
steel
guarantees.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
the
increased
price…
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes
i
do,
but…
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
mr.
justice
black’s
opinion
indicates
that
the
uniqueness
is
evidence
of
the
economic
power.
he
does
not
say
that
it
is
the
only
thing.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
it
is
in
the
context
of
our
proof.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
i
have
always
thought
it
is
because
of
loans.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
no
because
i
think
i
have…
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
but
i
have
other
evidence.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
no
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
he
did
not
suggest
that
that
was
enough
by
itself,
no
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
he
said
that
it
may
well
be
i
believe
is
the
frame…
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
we
have
got
the
number
of
times
created
by
the
special
financing
program,
in
this
case,
the
numbers
of
ties.
the
opinion
in
this
case
indicates
that
the
numbers
may
again
be
evidence
of
economic
power.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
the
numbers
your
honor
are
depending
on
how
you
want
to
look
at
one
bit
of
evidence
is
that
all
of
loans
that
they
made
involved
the
time.
another
bit
of
evidence
is
that
the
special
financing
program,
which
was
the
program
intended
to
get
the
business
when
good
banking
principles
were
not
applicable
involved
that
we
know
of
43
loans
concerning
over
$7,700,000
in
loans
and
which
obviously
had
to
affect
a
very,
very
substantial
numbers
of
house
packages
because
these
$7,700,000
of
loans
only
involved
the
land
acquisition
and
development
aspect
of
the
program
owner.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes
sir,
they
are
43
different
builders.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
obviously,
i
isolated
the
–
i
did
not
duplicate.
there
were
more
loans
than
that
because
they
may
have
had
three
loans
to
one
builders,
but
i
cut
it
down.
this
is
the
finding
of
the
trial
court
also
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
west
to
the
mississippi.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
no,
i
am
sorry,
east
of
the
mississippi,
excuse
me.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes
sir.
our
discovery
as
to
them
was
limited
to
their
identity.
we
got
the
list
because
it
is
an
attachment
to
the
underwriting
agreements
in
which
the
guarantees
were
made
by
us
steel
to
the
credit
corporation
which
is
a
part
of
the
record
and
we
were
limited
in
our
discovery
in
that
area.
so
we
did
not
get
into
a
great
deal
of
depth
in
the
discovery
concerning
them.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
again…
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
no
sir,
well,
i
again
apply
the
same
principle
of
this
guarantee
by
us
steel
itself
to
the
credit
corporation
as
being
separate
evidence
of
economic
power.
it
is
recognized
very
strongly
by
judge
gordon
in
his
findings,
simply
because
there
was
not
anybody
else
in
this
business
that
was
in
a
position
to…
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
the
way
they
did
it
here.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
where
you
deliberately
set
out
to
achieve
a
purpose
with
a
particular
program
and
are
willing
to
backup
that
program
with
funds
generated
from
other
aspects
of
your
business
and
where
it
is
obvious
that
because
of
the
risks
involved
others
at
that
time
and
under
those
circumstances
are
not
in
a
position
to
do
this,
yes
sir.
i
think
this
is
very
strong
evidence
of
economic
power,
exercised
in
this
situation
at
this
time
and
at
this
place.
this
is
just
like
a
–
this
is
similar
to
situation
with
a
trademark
or
a
patent,
the
trademark
or
a
patent.
the
gist
is
it
exists,
is
not
really
significant
unless
and
until
it
is
promoted,
advertised
or
whatever
and
you
have
to
have
money
to
do
that.
so
you
take
your
money
and
your
patent
and
you
create
not
just
with
the
patent
alone,
but
the
money
and
the
patent
are
the
situations
that
create
the
demand
that
allow
you
in
those
situations
to
create
a
tie-in
or
with
a
trademark
in
our
franchising
cases,
but
in
all
of
these
situations,
money
is
the
root,
the
base
that
establishes
what
you
can
do
with
it
and
if
you
do
not
create
the
consumer
acceptance
by
letting
people
know
that
you
got
this
patent
and
what
it
will
do
or
by
establishing
through
advertising
the
acceptability
of
the
trademark
you
still
do
not
have
any
economic
base
to
have
a
tie-in.
thank
you.
