unknown
speaker
putting
your
point
a
little
differently,
fortner
could
afford
to
pay
more,
but
he
has
not,
as
if
he
paid
less
for
the
credit.
unknown
speaker
mr.
justice,
probably
you
stated
very
distinctly
that
is
our
position.
unknown
speaker
what
does
justice
black’s
opinion,
do
you
find
to
support
the
directed
verdict
on
liabilities
of
the
plaintiff?
unknown
speaker
you
think
that
court
file
a
mandated
of
this
court?
unknown
speaker
i
would
like
to
hear
you
on
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
anderson,
although
you
dislike
the
word,
‘cheap’
as
to
the
loans,
we
do
not
agree
that
the
record
indicates
that
these
loans
were
on
more
favorable
terms
than
were
available
elsewhere.
unknown
speaker
but
cutting
through
the
whole
thing,
what
is
your
position
with
respect
to
the
net
value
of
these
loans
to
your
client,
were
they
more
favorable
or
less
favorable?
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
more,
we
could
translate
that
that
is
a
cheaper
and
we
would
not
be
found
wrong.
unknown
speaker
i
realize
that,
but
cutting
through
it
all,
is
it
not
it
one
of
the
facts
that
we
start
with
on
this
posture
of
the
case
that
everybody
agrees
these
were
favorable
loans
for
your
client.
unknown
speaker
mr.
anderson,
i
do
not
mean
to
get
interrupting,
but
in
terms
of
analyzing
the
case
under
the
antitrust
laws,
does
it
matter
in
your
position
as
to
whether
the
more
favorable
aspect
was
simply
a
reduction
in
interest
rate
or
a
combination
of
other
factors,
would
we
not
have
the
same
legal
issue
either
way?
unknown
speaker
then
you
have
to
help
me
because
i
do
not
understand
your
position.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
some
chances
on
the
100%.
unknown
speaker
in
fact
the
other
fact
puts
so
much
emphasis
on
fact
that
others
continue
to
give
on
100%
afterwards.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
is
enough
of
it?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
all
you
are
saying
is
that
there
are
number
of
ways
that
a
seller
can
cut
the
price
of
the
tie-in
product.
he
can
cut
the
interest
rate,he
can
eliminate
personal
guarantees,
he
can
make
the
principal
larger,
he
can
do
all
sorts
of
things.
but
in
terms
of
antitrust
consequences
what
difference
does
it
make
which
means
he
takes
to
cut
the
price,
it
is
still
the
same
element.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
continue
to
loan
below
cost.
unknown
speaker
and
let
us
turn
that
around.
united
states
steel
was
primarily
interested
in
selling
those
houses,
were
they
not?
unknown
speaker
and
so
if
they
find
a
customer
who
wants
to
buy,
however,
they
came
together
and
they
are
ready
to
buy,
let
us
say
we
have
it
kind
of
financed
and
us
steel
says
alright
we
will
finance
it
for
you.
unknown
speaker
i
think
your
position
is
that
fortner
–
our
opinion
and
mr.
justice
black’s
opinion
to
the
court
that
fortner
did
not
purport
to
water
down
the
necessity
for
proving
sufficient
amount
of
economic
power
in
the
tie-in
product?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
the
critical
evidence
is
of
economic
power
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
do
not
know
about
mr.
justice
black,
but
in
this
case
what
do
you
think
that
critical
evidence
is
of
economic
power
in
the
credit
market
over
the
credit
market?
unknown
speaker
they
are
just
the
low
credit
terms,
no
favorable
credit
terms…
unknown
speaker
not
even
cheap.
unknown
speaker
the
favorable
guarantee.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
that
would
be
enough
by
itself,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
is
apparent
from
mr.
justice
black’s
opinion?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
that,
but
so
you
think
he
says
it
would
be
sufficient
by
itself?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
is?
unknown
speaker
you
almost
must
say
so
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
other
evidence?
unknown
speaker
what
is
that?
the
fact
that
the
higher
price
for
the
tied
product.
unknown
speaker
you
would
not
think
that
would
be
enough
in
itself?
unknown
speaker
and
mr.
justice
black
did
not
suggest
it.
unknown
speaker
but
he
said
it
might
be
evident.
unknown
speaker
alright,
what
else
have
you
got?
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
numbers
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
just
so
i
have
it,
are
these
43
loans
that
you
refer
to
companies
other
than
fortner
and
are
they
43
different
builders
or
43?
unknown
speaker
i
see,
unknown
speaker
in
what
geographical
areas
were
those
43
people
are
having
institutions
located?
unknown
speaker
and
fortner
is
east
of
the
mississippi?
unknown
speaker
so
these
are
43,
are
east
of
the
mississippi,
that
is
much
as
we
know
about
them.
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
you
got
the
favorable
credit
terms,
you
got
the
higher
price
of
the
tied
product
and
you
have
got
the
fact
that
us
steel
managed
to
make
a
fair
number
of
some
other
loans,
43
other
loans.
unknown
speaker
that
is
it?
unknown
speaker
this
was
a
deep
business,
it
sort
of
the
deep
pocket
approach.
unknown
speaker
if
you
are
rich
enough,
you
have
got
economic
power.
unknown
speaker
if
loans,
if
sour
loans
would
not
really
break
you,
you
have
got
enough
economic
power.
unknown
speaker
mr.
flinn,
before
you
sit
down,
now
these
43
other
loans
that
your
opponent
referred
to,
were
they
contemporaneous
or
were
they
spread
over,
created?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
whether
or
not
there
was
a
tie
with
respect
to
those
43
other
loans?
