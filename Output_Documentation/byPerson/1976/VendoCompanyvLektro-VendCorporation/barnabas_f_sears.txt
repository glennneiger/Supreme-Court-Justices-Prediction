mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
you
will
pardon
me
a
moment?
there
are
few
matters
that
i
would
like
to
get
clarified
having
listened
to
the
argument
of
my
distinguished
friend.
one
was
his
representation
that
just
last
a
few
months
ago
before
his
honor
judge
will
(ph)
that
we
had
admitted
before
him
that
regardless
of
what
this
court
decides
does
not
make
any
difference.
now,
for
some
reason
or
other
he
left
out
a
very
important
passage
that
appeared
in
the
transcript
of
the
case.
i
have
the
transcript
here,
and
what
he
left
out
was
the
statement
that
i
made
immediately
following
the
statement
that
mr.
baker
said,
?that
is
right?,
i
said
?they
do?.
they
say
they
are
not
trying
to
interfere
with
the
prosecution
of
this
case.
all
they
are
doing
is
trying
to
keep
us
from
getting
an
injunction
to
keep
this
case
alive.
that
is
all
it
amounts
to,
and
i
have
some
question
with
respect
to
with
all
deference
again
to
my
distinguished
friend,
the
propriety
according
a
record
like
that.
now,
they
have
got
two
supplements
in
this
reply
brief
of
theirs.
one
is
supplement
a
which
is
the
statement
of
stoner
given
to
the
commission.
all
that
was
before
his
honor
judge
mclaren
and
that
is
supposed
to
be
a
dispositive
of
something,
i
do
not
know
what,
but
it
was
all
before
judge
mclaren.
now,
supplement
b
is
a
supplement
to
their
reply
brief,
the
trust
of
which
is
that
we
thwarted
the
prosecution
of
this
case
by
our
dilatory
tactics.
now,
we
had
in
our
brief
what
you?re
his
honor
judge
mclaren
said
and
what
they
have
assured
the
court.
we
had
before
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
a
supplement
and
i
have
what
here
which
sets
forth
the
entire
history
of
the
case.
now,
i
desire
a
supplement
to
their
reply
brief
that
certainly
seems
to
me
that
they
should
have
appended
the
supplement
that
we
appended.
what
do
we
find
in
that
supplement,
if
the
court
will
part
me
from
reading
it.
now,
this
is
mr.
slager
statement
to
the
trial
court
on
february
10th
1971,
we
do
want
to
get
it
tried
as
soon
as
possible.
there
is
a
federal
case
if
they
seem
to
be
able
to
move
ahead
on.
i
realize
it
is
the
motion.
it
is
not
like
a
trial
but
they
have
accrued
that
one
firm
is
handling
it.
it
seems
like
they
are
all
in
a
record,
but
they
are
able
to
move
ahead
on
that
but
not
this
one.
now,
again
with
all
deference,
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
obvious
that
what
his
honor
judge
mclaren
said
in
this
record
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
the
parties
had
agreed
that
the
federal
case
would
await
the
final
determination
of
the
state
proceedings,
and
that
was
evidenced
by
the
proceedings
before
him.
they
agreed
to
a
standby
order
so
he
could
pass
upon
the
propriety
of
our
application
for
a
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
i
think
it
was
in
fight
your
honor,
i
believe
that
is
correct
and
the
parties
agreed
to
it.
i
think
that
is
correct.
but
however
one
states
the
case
in
its
present
frame
of
reference
the
bald
fact
is
that
petitioner
is
claiming
the
approach
of
a
successful
consummation
of
an
illegal
objective.
this
would
seem
startling
enough
where
there
is
purely
private
litigation,
but
it
is
not.
it
is
a
litigation
so
deeply
impressed
with
the
public
interest
in
the
enforcement
of
the
sherman
act
that
private
persons
are
endowed
with
de
facto
official
powers
as
private
attorneys
general
to
ensure
the
enforcement
of
that
sadatory
and
overriding
public
federal
policies
so
vital
to
economic
welfare
of
the
republic.
in
its
present
form
of
reference
the
question
is
whether
the
federal
antitrust
laws
can
be
enforced
against
the
sherman
act
violator.
i
say
to
the
present
frame
--
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
well,
it
can
go
right
ahead
without
the
benefit
of
a
preliminary
injunction
which
if
we
do
not
get
it
will
completely
destroy
it.
it
will
completely
--
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
two
of
the
federal
plaintiffs
lektro-vend
corporation
and
stoner
investments
who
have
separate
and
distinct
claims
under
the
sherman
act
will
be
completely
denied
a
federal
court
room.
i
mean
i
cannot
express
it
any
better
and
than
his
honor
judge
mclaren
expressed
it
in
his
opinion.
now,
with
respect
to
the
third
claim,
he
found
that
the
stoner
himself
would
be
severely
crippled
in
the
prosecution
of
the
case,
and
therefore
he
held
with
respect
to
the
question,
there
was
no
case
or
controversy
if
that
occurred
and
that
it
was
necessary
--
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
i
do
not
think
it
would.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
exactly.
that
is
precisely
what
the
court
found.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
that
is
correct.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
well,
it
is
the
separate
completely
all
in
the
grounds
they
refused
to
pass
on
--
they
held
that
stoner
had
violated
his
fiduciary
duty
and
that
he
had
ceased
a
corporate
opportunity.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
yeah.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
no,
i
would
not,
because
the
question
of
the
breach
of
the
fiduciary
duty
as
judge
mclaren
pointed
out
in
his
opinion
was
inextricably
interwoven
with
an
anti-comparative
characters
of
the
agreement
that
they
sued
on
in
the
state
court.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
that
is
correct.
if
i
understand
your
honor?s
inquiry
that
is
absolutely
correct
and
that
is
what
mclaren
held
because
stoner
would
never
have
become
a
director
apart
from
the
covenants
and
the
evidence
is
replete
with
evidence,
the
record
is
replete
with
evidence
indicating
the
intent
of
vendo
in
procuring
those
anticompetitive
covenants.
well
the
reasons
why
they
made
him
a
director,
he
was
to
serve
as
a
director
without
pay.
it
is
interesting
to
know
that
we
examine
this
record
in
this
case
based
the
court
did
not
upset
any
statement,
any
ruling
of
judge
schaefer.
he
examined
those
proceedings
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
or
not
vendo
prosecuted
them
as
a
part
of
an
anticompetitive
scheme.
when
you
examine
a
record
--
and
we
are
not
seeking
to
impeach
that
record
in
the
slightest,
but
when
you
do
examine
that
record
you
will
find
that
the
evidence
upon
which
he
based,
the
record
on
which
he
based,
the
statement
that
stoner
has
violated
his
fiduciary
duty,
because
vendo
did
not
have
a
genuine
opportunity
to
purchase
the
lektro-vend
machine
was
completely
without
support
in
that
state
court
record,
and
that
state
court
record
did
not
mention
at
all
the
fact
that
stoner
had
warned
vendo
that
their
failure
to
purchase
the
lektro-vend
machine
was
a
serious
mistake,
and
add
to
which
in
the
record
before
the
judge
mclaren.
when
the
federal
depositions
came
in
it
became
even
more
conclusive
that
at
no
time
that
vendo
ever
wanted
to
purchase
the
lektro-vend
machine
and
all
time
they
thought
that
lektro-vend
machine
was
completely
too
expensive
to
operate.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
well
i
have
made
a
mistake
your
honor,
i
should
have
said
that
he
was
to
serve
as
a
director
without
additional
compensation.
that
is
what
i
should
have
said.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
well,
they
have
never
consulted
him
about
anything,
i
mean
it
was
a
pure
sham
from
the
outset.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
yes
he
was
indeed
your
honor.
he
was
receiving
$50,000
a
year,
but
it
was
a
pure
sham
and
judge
mclaren
--
five
days
of
hearings
now
we
had.
we
had
the
records
of
the
two
state
trials
and
examining
that
record
carefully
--
and
mr.
stoner
was
a
witness
then
you
had
an
opportunity
to
present
whatever
evidence
they
desired
to
present.
examining
that
record,
carefully
examining
that
record,
he
found
that
section
1
was
violated
by
those
non-competitive
agreements,
those
contracts
violated
section
1
of
the
sherman
act,
and
he
found
evidence
tending
to
show
that
they
have
violated
section
2.
now,
there
was
of
plenty
of
evidences
to
support
that.
my
dear
friend
talks
about
a
10-year
marathon.
we
had
a
10-year
marathon
indeed.
we
had
the
first
case
where
they
sued
to
enforce
those
covenants
which
violated
the
sherman
act.
so,
there
were
engaging
then
in
an
illegal
objective,
but
we
had
more
than
that.
we
had
a
claim
assorted
that
stoner
had
stolen
a
trade
secret
belonging
to
vendo,
and
the
appellate
court
reversed
that
on
the
ground
that
there
was
not
any
evidence
at
all
to
support
that
charge,
and
in
the
statement
of
facts
that
they
give
that
particular
finding,
they
conveniently
overlook,
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
so.
so
that
was
part
of
the
10-year
marathon.
so,
we
continue
with
this
10-year
marathon,
and
the
second
time
we
are
confronted
with
the
proposition
that
he
was
responsible
for
the
fact
that
they
did
not
have
that
fifo
machine.
now,
if
there
is
any
thing
more
conclusive
in
this
record
that
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
upon
which
to
base
that
claim,
and
that
they
knew
or
should
have
known
certainly
at
the
time
they
filed
a
lawsuit
back
in
1965.
whether
that
charge
was
true
they
should
have
asserted
all
charges
they
had
against
him,
and
this
evidence
shows
also
that
his
is
not
the
first
time
they
used
the
judicial
process
for
purposes
other
than
what
i
consider
at
least
to
be
a
legitimate
purpose.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
yes
you
can
your
honor.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
well,
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
collectible
your
honor.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
well,
i
would
say
this
about
that.
full
faith
and
credit,
i
can
not
say
that
any
better
than
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
in
a
specially
concurring
opinion
in
younger.
they
argue
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
state
interest
more
significant
than
the
jurisdiction
of
its
courts,
that
finality
and
the
integrity
of
their
judgments,
and
the
enforcements
of
the
sate
law
rules
as
to
fiduciary
conduct.
now,
sure
in
the
different
context,
and
i
am
aware
of
a
fact
that
a
word
is
not
crystal
clear
and
unchanged,
it
is
the
skin
of
a
living
thought,
and
may
vary
greatly
in
content
and
meaning
depending
upon
the
circumstances
and
time
of
its
utterance
as
justice
holmes(ph)
reminded
us
years
ago.
i
am
mind
full
of
that,
but
here
is
what
mr.
justice
stewart
said
in
the
younger
case,
in
such
circumstances
the
reasons
of
policy
for
differing
to
state
adjudications
are
outplayed
by
the
injury
flowing
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
state
proceedings.
by
the
perversion
of
the
very
process
that
is
supposed
to
provide
vindication,
and
by
the
need
for
speedy
and
effective
action
to
protect
federal
rights.
now,
record
of
that
on
page
74.
so,
what
vendo
was
saying
that
it
may
pervert
the
process
as
in
a
state
court
and
notwithstanding
comity
or
full
faith
and
credit
requires
that
the
state
court
judgment
obtained
by
such
means
is
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
that
is
correct.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
well,
and
that
is
the
court
is
assuming
as
if
the
judgment
is
protected
by
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
--
i
mean
this
a
federal
statutory
prohibition,
and
the
full
faith
and
credit
--
are
you
going
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
a
judgment
procured
in
violation
of
federal
law?
are
you
going
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
a
judgment
which
was
part
and
parcel
of
a
scheme
to
violate
the
federal
laws?
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
well,
i
think
that
--
i
do
not
think
the
full
faith
and
credit
statute
applies
at
all.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
well,
for
the
very
reason
that
i
stated.
i
mean
isn?t
that
reductive
and
absurdtive
(ph)
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
a
judgment
in
a
federal
court
that
was
procured
as
part
and
parcel
of
a
violation
of
the
federal
law.
you
give
that
full
faith
and
credit
in
a
federal
court.
i
do
not
believe
you
do
with
all
the
efforts.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
well
you
know
i
have
said
that
there
is
a
lot
of
statutory
rules
that
say
that
a
case
within
the
letter
but
without
the
spirit
of
the
statute
is
without
the
statute,
and
a
case
without
the
letter
but
within
the
spirit
is
within
the
statute.
now,
i
think
that
is
sort
of
a
casual
or
thumbnail
statement,
but
i
think
there
is
substantial
law
to
support
that
preposition.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
no,
it
was
not
presented
to
judge
mclaren.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
2283
--
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
no,
it
was
not,
even
i
heard
hardly
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
as
i
recall
it.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
no,
it
was
not
indeed.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
i
am
sure
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
address
it.
i
should
not
be
dogmatic,
i
have
got
no
--
pardon
me
--
i
have
lived
long
enough
to
know
that
i
should
not
be
dogmatic
about
anything,
and
--
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
well,
i
am
not
submitting
anything.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
oh
no
indeed.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
well,
the
difference
is
your
honor
that
there
were
not
any
federal
questions.
i
mean
there
were
not
any
federal
questions
as
such
except
due
process.
there
were
no
federal
antitrust
questions
involved
in
the
petition
for
cert.
they
involved
due
process.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
no,
we
want
it
stayed
your
honor.
i
mean,
and
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
i
am
--
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
well,
it
will
state
pendite
lite,
that
is
the
only
issue
that
is
before
the
court.
it
would
state
pendite
lite.
now,
what
the
ultimate
state
of
that
judgment
might
be,
it
is
a
question
to
be
decided
upon
a
record
where
that
question
is
an
issue
and
with
respect
to
that
i
say
well
sufficient
under
the
day
is
the
evil
thereof,
we
do
not
really
have
that
issue
before
us.
now,
i
am
about
to
exhaust
in
my
time.
i
want
to
speak
briefly
to
2283.
we
quoted
kiplen(ph)
an
opinion
by
judge
finley
(ph)
to
support
the
doctrine
of
mitchum
versus
foster.
they
have
applied
the
doctrine
of
mitchum
v.
foster
and
studebaker
v.
gittlin,
and
you
gentlemen
are
as
familiar
with
case
as
i
am,
there
is
not
more
so.
they
came
back
and
they
relegated
studebaker
versus
gittlin
to
a
footnote,
both
in
their
original
brief
and
in
reply
brief,
and
they
quoted
--
i
guess
the
white
light
says
i
have
a
few
minutes.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
thank
you.
they
quoted
three
cases,
vernitron,
jennings,
and
glen
w.
turner,
where
each
one
is
contrary
to
the
issue
so
the
injunction
here,
and
each
one
of
those
cases
completely
dissimilar
on
the
facts.
none
involved
violation
of
the
federal
antitrust
laws,
but
the
interesting
thing
about
those
three
cases
is
the
fact
that
each
one
of
them
recognize
the
doctrine
or
recognize
the
studebaker
v.
gittlin
which
they
have
relegated
to
a
footnote.
that
was
just
by
way
of
dictum.
so,
i
do
not
see
how
they
can
be
contrary
to
what
we
are
arguing
here
when
they
expressly
recognize
a
case
upon
which
we
rely.
that
is
what
the
district
court
--
the
district
court
did
the
same
thing.
for
example,
in
jennings
which
is
a
procedurally
very
similar
case
to
ours,
judge
höger
(ph)
sat
for
the
third
circuit
said,
?certainly
studebaker
qualified
under
the
test
subsequently
set
forth
in
mitchum
v.
foster
whether
an
act
of
congress
clearly
creating
a
federal
right
or
remedy
enforceable
in
a
federal
court
of
equity,
could
be
given
its
intended
scope
only
by
a
stay
of
the
state
court
proceedings.?
now,
our
case
is
stronger
than
the
securities
act
case
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
the
securities
act
do
not
to
provide
for
a
treble
damages,
nor
does
it
except
in
some
rare
cases,
as
i
understand
the
law
and
i
am
not
absolutely
certain
of
this.
it
does
provide
to
some
cases
for
the
assessment
of
damages
against
the
defendants.
now,
briefly
on
comity
and
federalism,
i
have
quoted
the
separately
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
stewart
with
respect
to
that
question.
i
think
that
the
judge
mclaren,
the
late
judge
mclaren,
i
am
perfectly
contained
to
rely
on
his
very
carefully
written
opinion
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
that
question.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
indeed
he
did.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
well,
he
said
that
this
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
anticompetitive
covenants
and
they
couldn?t
be
snipped
apart.
he
specifically
said
that
in
answer
to
their
argument.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
but
that
is
entirely
ignoring
the
facts
of
the
case
on
antitrust
standpoint,
which
issue
was
not
before
him?
i
mean
the
facts
that
he
breached
the
fiduciary
relationship
assuming
that
he
did,
and
the
records
in
this
case
before
judge
mclaren
would
show
no
such
brief,
but
even
assuming
--
pardon
me,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
no,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
well,
the
point
about
it
was
that
it
was
not
sustainable
on
a
purely...
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
well,
it
depends
on
whether
you
read
it.
we
have
stated
what
the
record
showed.
your
honors
can
draw
your
own
conclusions
about
what
the
state
of
the
record
was
with
respect
to
--
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
yes
this
injunction
would
certainly
stand.
if
i
understand
your
honor?s
inquiry
--
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
but
how
can
you
--
i
misunderstood
your
honor?s
question.
how
is
it
possible
for
a
court
to
say
that
this
judgment
can
stand
in
so
far
as
the
antitrust
laws
are
concerned.
this
is
what
we
are
talking
about;
we
are
talking
about
a
case
that
was
prosecuted
as
part
and
partial
of
a
scheme
violate
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
if
this
was
prosecuted
as
a
part
of
a
scheme
to
violate
the
antitrust
laws,
it
does
not
make
any
difference
whether
the
means
employed
were
lawful
or
unlawful,
and
it
does
not
make
a
better
difference
whether
there
was
a
successful
consummation
of
a
scheme
which
had
an
illegal
objective.
they
eventually
--
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
of
course
it
was
bound
up
with
it,
and
so
mclaren
held
and
we
think
that
finding
on
judge
mclaren
--
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
alright.
well,
i
will
terminate
too
your
honor.
mr.
barnabas
f.
sears
i
want
to
thank
you
very
much
and
i
have
enjoyed
the
honor
of
the
period.
