justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
pollock,
it
was
then
in
the
federal
court
all
this
period,
wasn?t
it?
for
some
time
prior
to
this
trial
they
had
been
asserting
their
federal
antitrust
theory,
had
they
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
was
more
or
less
set
on
the
backburners,
phrase
we
used
to
use,
while
a
state
preceding
was
completed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
will
rely
and
this
is
the
waiver.
they
did
not
have
any
need
for
an
injunction
as
long
as
they
are
willing
to
try
out
the
state
issues
in
the
state
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
really
just
relying
on
the
anti-injunction
statute,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
i
am
suggesting
is
the
issues
would
be
exactly
the
same
if
the
problem
arose
ten
years
ago
instead
of
today,
the
legal
issues.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
then
decided
whether
to
try
those
issues
in
the
federal
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
do
not
think
they
will
be
seeking
any
rehearing
or
appeal
of
any
state
issue
decided
in
the
state
proceeding.
they
are
claiming
that
this
whole
thing
is
illegal
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
but
that
is
not
a
review
of
the
state.
is
that
a
review
of
any
issue
decided
by
the
state
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
total
result,
i
understand
that.
