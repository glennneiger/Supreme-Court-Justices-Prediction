unknown
speaker
but
i
suppose
that
it
is
true
that
the
defendant
in
the
state
sued
to
your
opponents
could
not
affect
any
relief,
antitrust
relief,
in
the
state
court.
it
might
have
been
a
defense
that
they
could
not
have
gotten
a
judgment.
unknown
speaker
well,
yes
or
no?
that
is
true,
isn?t
it?
unknown
speaker
alright,
let
us
suppose
that
in
the
--
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
now,
how
about
in
the
federal
court
though,
when
was
the
federal
suit
filed?
unknown
speaker
and
what
if
the
--
did
the
federal
judge
there
in
that
suit
indicate
that
he
would
not
go
ahead
as
long
as
the
federal
defense
was
pending
in
the
state
court.
unknown
speaker
yes
unknown
speaker
the
federal
plaintiffs
urge
to
the
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
that,
but
i
suppose
he
did
not
have
a
choice
between
or
there
was
a
choice
to
be
made
as
to
whether
to
submit
the
antitrust
defense
in
the
state
court
or
not,
because
it
was
decided
against
in
there,
he
could
never
have
any
relief
order
in
the
federal
court,
and
then
the
federal
court
was
the
only
court
that
could
have
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
so
it
would
not
be
a
collateral
stopple.
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
think
there
would
be
any
res
judicata
but
there
would
collateral
stopple.
unknown
speaker
those
issues
could
not
be
retried
in
the
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
nothing
was
litigated
there
with
respect
to
an
antitrust
defense
because
that
was
withdrawn.
unknown
speaker
some
of
the
facts
on
your
affirmative
case
are
the
same
ones
involved
in
the
--
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you,
would
you
be
here
making
the
same
argument
that
there
had
never
been
any
antitrust
defense
filed
and
withdrawn?
unknown
speaker
you
would
not
be
arguing
that
he
should
have
and
did
not
present
his
antitrust
defense
in
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
and
if
there
had
been
no
antitrust
defense
filed
and
then
withdrawn
and
then
he
went
to
court
alleging
that
the
state
proceeding
in
itself
and
the
collection
of
the
judgment
would
violate
the
antitrust
laws.
would
you
would
be
back
to
2283
argument?
unknown
speaker
so,
let
me
get
it
clear.
suppose
no
antitrust
defense
in
the
state
court
and
then
withdrawn,
and
the
federal
antitrust
suit
filed.
would
you
make
a
motion
in
that
federal
antitrust
case
for
the
federal
court
to
hold
its
hand
or
to
abstain
and
let
the
federal
defenses
to
be
presented
in
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
are
not
saying
it
is
younger
--
it
would
be
any
younger
situation
at
all.
unknown
speaker
mr.
pollock,
is
it
also
equally
true
that
there
is
no
issue
before
us
as
to
the
validity
of
the
district
court?s
finding
that
there
is
a
probability
of
success
for
your
opponents
on
the
antitrust
issues?
unknown
speaker
yes,
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense--
but
i
just
want
to
be
clear.
that
is
not
before
us
really.
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
truth.
unknown
speaker
i
appreciate,
but
we
just
do
not
need
to
get
into
that
nor
to
reach
the
issue
that
you
do
want
us
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
it
sounds
though
that
the
submission
of
the
defense
that
has
withdrawal
after
the
appeal
is
a
fairly
critical
part
of
your
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
aside
from
2283
though,
again,
assume
there
had
been
no
filing
of
the
defense
and
no
withdrawal
and
then
after
the
judgment
was
entered,
this
district
court
did
exactly
what
it
did
here.
you
would
not
say
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
do
it
or
that
it
was
a
violation
of
younger
against
harris
or
anything
like
that.
you
will
just
say
that
2283
would
be
your
only
point.
unknown
speaker
i
agree
with
you,
but
if
there
had
not
been
the
filing
in
the
withdrawal,
2283
would
be
your
sole
point.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
are
well
in
to
your
rebuttal
time,
mr.
pollock.
unknown
speaker
mr.
pollock,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
on
the
court?s
time,
if
i
may.
do
you
make
any
claim
here
that
because
of
the
final
nature
of
the
judgment
of
the
illinois
court
the
federal
courts
were
required
to
accord
full
faith
and
credit
to
it?
unknown
speaker
then
it
is
different
than
a
2283
claim,
isn?t
it?
unknown
speaker
that
would
apply
even
if
the
clayton
act
is
an
exception
to
2283.
wouldn?t
it
because
of
the
finality
of
the
state
court
judgment?
unknown
speaker
mr.
pollock,
doesn?t
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
only
apply
to
the
states?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
statute.
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
your
opponent
--
it
was
then
your
suggestion
that
judge
thought
the
federal
case
ought
to
await
the
outcome
of
the
state
case.
unknown
speaker
but
your
suit
can
go
right
ahead
mr.
sears.
unknown
speaker
your
suit
can
go
right
ahead,
can?t
it?
unknown
speaker
if
the
state
court
judgment
is
enforced
the
federal
plaintiff
will
be
without
resources
to
carry
it
on,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
judgments,
what
if
the
state
court
judgment
was
against
your
clients
was
on
some
completely
unrelated
matter.
it
is
a
very
large
judgment
and
if
it
was
collected
your
plaintiffs
would
be,
your
clients
would
be
wiped
out
and
could
not
go
forward
in
the
federal
court.
that
would
be
no
excuse
for
an
injunction,
i
do
not
suppose,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
now,
it
is
critical
for
you
to
say
that
the
state
suit
itself
and
the
collection
of
the
judgment
is
part
of
the
antitrust
violation.
unknown
speaker
well
now,
was
it
or
was
it
not
--
all
in
ground
in
the
state
court
that
your
clients
were
holding
a
side
from
the
contract,
holding
a
side
from
the
no
competition
agreements
where
violating
a
judiciary
obligation?
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
a
completely
separate
all
in
the
ground
in
a
state
court.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
would
be
here
making
the
same
argument
as
there
had
never
been
a
no-competition
agreement?
unknown
speaker
you
say
those
are
indivisible,
so
that
it
could
not
be
in
all
the
ground.
unknown
speaker
i
made
the
conclusion
on
one
factual
matter
mr.
sears.
you
said
when
he
was
a
director
without
compensation
were
not
some
of
these
alleged
breaches
of
fiduciary
duty,
some
that
were
found,
events
that
occurred
at
a
period
when
he
was
receiving
$50,000
a
year
as
a
consulting
engineer
or
a
consultant?
unknown
speaker
and
his
consulting
fee
was
a
separate
fact.
unknown
speaker
but
he
was
receiving
$50,000.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sear,
can
i
interpret
for
just
a
moment?
unknown
speaker
i
have
two
questions.
it
seems
to
me
you
are
arguing
in
effect
that
they
did
commit
an
antitrust
violation,
i
should
observe
that
they
did
refer
to
the
trade
secret
claim
in
footnote
7
of
their
brief
that
conveniently
omit
that,
but
the
question
i
had
is
what
is
your
theory
of
what
happens
to
the
state
court
judgment
if
you
win?
their
last
point
was
rested
on
full
faith
and
credit.
what
will
happen
to
the
state
court
judgment
if
you
prevail
in
the
antitrust
litigation?
will
it
be
collectible
or
not
or
will
be
multiplied
by
the
three
and
you
get
three
times
the
value.
unknown
speaker
so
what
do
you
say
about
the
statutory
requirement
of
full
faith
and
credit
in
the
state
court
judgment.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sears.
unknown
speaker
i
see
why
you
referred
to
justice
holmes(ph)
algorithm
before
referring
to
justice
stewart
concurrence
in
younger,
because
younger
was
not
dealing
with
any
final
judgments
of
a
state
court,
it
was
just
dealing
with
the
inceptions
of
a
state
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
reasoning
would
necessarily
carry
over
to
a
final
judgment
that
was
presumably
protected
by
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
the
scope
of
this
exception
that
you
think
is
implied
in
the
full
faith
and
credit
statute
where
you
do
not
have
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
the
way
the
statute
says?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean
mr.
sears
that
the
threshold
question
in
a
claim
for
full
faith
and
credit
which
you
have
been
asserted
that
the
court,
to
which
that
claim
is
presented,
must
re-litigate
the
case
and
decide
whether
it
is
really
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit?
unknown
speaker
was
the
full
faith
and
credit
issue
presented
to
judge
mclaren?
unknown
speaker
the
only
2283?
unknown
speaker
that
was
presented
but
not
the
full
faith
and
credit?
unknown
speaker
but
it
was
not
presented
to
judge
mclaren?
unknown
speaker
did
court
of
appeals
address
it?
unknown
speaker
at
least
not
too
much.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sears,
but
what
i
see
is,
aren?t
you
asking
for
the
exact
same
relief
you
advanced
this
court
from
asserting.
unknown
speaker
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
but
the
fundamental
relief
you
want
is
to
upset
the
judgment.
to
revise
it.
unknown
speaker
how
long
will
it
state?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sears,
did
the
judge,
the
late
judge
consider
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
holding
that
the
directors
had
violated
their
fiduciary
relationship?
unknown
speaker
what
did
he
say
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
could
he
--
do
you
think
that
was
a
very
--
well
i
will
put
it
this
way.
if
you
read
the
supreme
court
of
illinois?
opinion
and
get
the
impression
that
judge
schaefer
was
sustaining
the
judgment
on
the
alternate
grounds
the
breach
of
fiduciary
relationships,
and
justice
stevens
is
saying,
even
if
there
were
never
any
contracts
here
the
judgment
would
stand.
unknown
speaker
well,
go
ahead
i
am
sorry.
unknown
speaker
well,
assuming
that
the
judgment
was
sustainable
under
the
illinois
law
and
the
completely
independent
ground
the
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
what
business
did
a
federal
court,
an
antitrust
court
have
enjoining
the
question
of
the
judgment?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
depends
on
how
you
read
justice
schaefer?s
opinion.
unknown
speaker
let
us
just
suppose
that
we
disagreed
with
whatever
judge
mclaren
said
about
their
being
intertwining,
suppose
we
read
the
opinion
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
as
same,
this
judgment
is
sustainable
in
the
wholly
independent
ground,
would
this
injunction
stands
or
not?
unknown
speaker
why
would
it,
because
there
would
be
nothing
violated
the
antitrust
laws
in
suing
for
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
are
saying
that
even
if
there
have
not
been
any
anticompetitive
contracts
involved,
you
could
still
allege
and
you
would
hope
to
prove
that
the
suit
for
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
was
part
of
an
illegal
scheme.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
they
resent
their
affirmative
claim
of
the
state
proceedings.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
under
huffman,
you
dismissed
the
case.
