mr.
earl
e.
pollock
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
preliminary
injunction
against
an
ongoing
state
court
preceding,
but
more
specifically
the
injunction
enjoins
a
state
court
proceeding
to
collect
final
state
court
judgments
in
the
amount
of
seven-and-a-half
million
dollars.
final
state
court
judgment
resulting
after
10
years
of
litigation
in
the
illinois
courts,
final
judgments
fully
reviewed
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
unanimously
affirmed
by
that
court
in
a
very
thorough
opinion
by
judge
walter
schaefer,
and
final
judgments
which
this
court
declined
to
review
on
petition
for
certiorari.
furthermore,
the
preliminary
injunction
was
issued
by
the
district
court
on
precisely
the
same
federal
grounds
which
the
state
defendants
have
specifically
raised
by
formal
pleading
in
the
state
preceding
as
a
defense.
a
defense
which
the
state
courts,
indeed
the
illinois
appellate
court,
specifically
ruled
was
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
illinois
courts
to
adjudicate.
a
defense,
however,
which
when
the
case
was
then
remanded
for
trial
on
that
defense
in
the
state
trial
court
the
state
defendants,
immediately
before
trial,
moved
to
withdraw
the
federal
antitrust
defense.
that
was
in
1971,
and
never
again
reasserted
that
federal
defense
in
the
state
proceeding.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor,
certainly
i
could
have
no
effect
on
the
either
of
the
section
2283
question
which
we
are
dealing
with
today,
or
comity
and
federalism
questions,
because
obviously
any
litigant
cannot
determine
for
himself
by
removing
a
defense
or
client
without
prejudice
that
whether
that
shall
affect
the
application
of
principles
of
comity
and
federalism.
i
thank
that
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
regardless
of
what
may
have
been
the
right
of
the
state
defendants
at
some
later
date
in
the
state
preceding
to
again
raise
the
federal
defense.
they
withdraw
that
defense
without
prejudice
in
1971
can
have
no
effect
for
the
reason
that
during
the
next
four
years
of
the
state
court
proceeding
the
state
defendants
never
chose
to
reassert
that
federal
defense.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
yes,
in
a
treble
damage
action
which
is
still
pending
and
which
indeed
will
be
going
to
trial.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
it
was
set
on
the
backburner
over
the
objection
of
my
client,
vendo.
we
have
set
forth
in
a
supplement
to
our
brief,
supplement
b,
a
full
statement
of
various
continuances
obtained
by
the
state
defendants
in
the
federal
case
with
respect
to
the
treble
damage
claim.
i
would
also
point
out
mr.
justice
stevens
that
throughout
the
10-year
period
of
the
state
court
proceedings,
1965-1975,
at
no
time
where
there
ever
any
intimation
that
at
the
conclusion
of
the
state
case.
the
state
defendants
in
there
federal
case
which
they
have
filed
after
the
state
proceedings
initiated,
there
is
never
any
information
that
the
state
defendants
or
the
federal
plaintiffs
would
ever
seek
to
enjoin
the
results
of
the
state
litigation,
but
instead
every
statement
by
the
state
defendants
or
the
federal
plaintiffs
in
the
federal
case
was
to
the
effect
that
if
vendo
is
successful
in
its
state
preceding
to
recover
judgments
as
it
did
then
the
state
defendants
would
seek
damages
based
in
part
on
the
state
court
proceeding,
but
not
until
january
1975
was
there
ever
the
slightest
intimation,
even
one
word
in
the
record,
about
obtaining
a
preliminary
injunction
against
state
court?s
decision.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
mr.
justice
stevens
we
are
not
arguing
waiver,
for
example
we
are
not
contending
that
the
federal
plaintiffs
are
barred
from
proceeding
with
their
treble
damage
action.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
relied
on
the
anti-injunction
statute,
and
in
addition
your
honor,
the
principles
of
comity
and
federalism
in
this
context
where
you
have
a
final
state
judgment.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
with
respect
to
section
2283,
i
think
that
is
correct,
but
the
additional
issue
as
presented
in
our
petition
relating
to
the
application
of
fundamental
principles
of
federal
state
relations,
are
effected
very
substantially
by
the
fact
that
here
you
have
state
court
defenders
who
has
specifically
raised
the
federal
defense,
and
then
went
all
the
way
up
to
the
illinois
appellate
court
insisting
that
they
have
the
right
to
have
the
state
court
determine
that
issue.
they
persuaded
the
illinois
appellate
court
that
they
did
have,
the
illinois
courts
did
have
jurisdiction.
having
persuaded
the
illinois
courts
that
the
illinois
courts
have
such
jurisdiction
--
and
that
opinion
of
the
illinois
appellate
court
is
at
pages
77-79
of
the
appendix.
when
the
case
was
remanded
for
trial,
so
that
they
could
have
the
opportunity
that
they
pleaded
they
wanted
to
have.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that
is
right,
and
withdrew
the
federal
defense
and
for
the
next
four
years,
the
last
four
years
of
this
marathon,
tenure
illinois
proceeding.
there
was
never
any
reference
on
their
part
to
the
federal
defense.
what
they
did
was
take
the
federal
defense,
stick
it
in
their
back
pocket,
where
it
could
be
used
possibly
at
a
later
day
in
the
event
the
judgment
was
added
against
them,
and
we
say
that
the
circumstances
here,
the
withdrawal
the
defense,
a
failure
to
reassert
it,
and
in
addition
the
clear
entitlement
of
these
judgments
to
full
faith
and
credit,
and
in
addition
the
basic
principle
set
forth
perhaps
most
clearly
in
this
court?s
decision
in
the
rucker
case
that
state
court
litigants
cannot
obtain
rehearing
or
appeal
by
going
to
a
federal
district
court,
it
has
distinguished
from
seeking
review
in
this
court.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
yes,
it
is
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
what
they
have
done
is
to
nullify
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
the
total
result,
and
not
only
to
nullify
the
state
judgment,
not
only
to
nullify
the
pending
state
proceedings
in
the
illinois
trial
court,
supplementary
proceedings,
which
have
been
initiated
before
the
motion
for
injunction
was
filed
to
enforce
the
judgment.
but
they
have
nullify,
to
that
extent,
these
fundamental
policies
of
the
state
of
illinois
concerning
the
fiduciary
duties
of
corporate
officers
and
the
records.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
well,
it
is
for
that
reason
your
honor
that
we
are
not
saying
that
they
are
precluded.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
the
relief,
you
are
right,
they
could
not
have
obtained
a
primitive
relief.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
the
relief
they
could
have
obtained
your
honor
would
be
to
prevent
the
judgment
from
being
erred.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
federal
suit
was
filed
two
months
after
the
state
proceeding.
it
was
filed
in
1965.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
no,
there
were
several
federal
judges
who
are
involved.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
so
one
of
the
federal
judges
insisted
that
the
case
proceed,
counsel
for
the
federal
plaintiffs
urge
the
federal
court,
pleaded
with
the
federal
court
to
defer
any
action
in
the
federal
case
until
the
state
court
proceeding
have
been
concluded,
and
at
least
on
two
occasions
have
set
forth
a
verbatim
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
yes,
as
set
forth
in
supplement
b
to
our
brief
where
we
quote
exactly
what
transpired
at
these
various
status
reports.
on
at
least
two
occasions,
counsel
for
vendo
protested
the
delay
of
the
treble
damage
case,
and
urged
the
court
to
go
ahead.
in
those
instances
at
that
time
the
federal
judge
accepted
the
entreaties
of
the
federal
plaintiffs
to
defer
any
action.
in
large
part
on
the
theory
that
in
fact
at
one
point
on
the
ground
that
the
federal
antitrust
defense
would
be
adjudicated
in
the
state
courts,
and
almost
within
the
following
few
months
counsel
for
the
federal
plaintiffs
went
into
the
state
court
in
which
he
proved
that
defense
so
that
it
could
never
be
adjudicated.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
no,
i
think
that
is
incorrect.
i
think
the
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
there
would
be
a
collateral
stopple
effect
with
respect
to
issues
which
were
actually
litigated
there.
there
would
not
be
a
res
judicata
effect
with
respect
to
the
claim
of
the
federal
plaintiffs
under
the
federal
treble
damage
actions.
a
number
of
decisions
have
pointed
out
a
significant
difference
and
the
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
there
would
be
collateral
stopple,
the
decision
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that
is
right.
we
are
not
suggesting
now
that
in
the
treble
damage
case,
which
is
proceeding
ahead
in
the
district
court
that
there
is
a
res
judicata
bar,
nor
can
there
be
a
collateral
stopple
bar
with
respect
to
issues
directly
concerning
the
federal
antitrust
defense
since
that
was
withdrawn.
so,
they
are
free
to
proceed
and
they
have
assured
the
district
court
that
even
with
this
within
the
last
month,
that
regardless
of
what
this
court
decides
with
respect
to
the
injunction,
that
they
are
proceeding
ahead
with
their
treble
damage
action.
as
i
have
indicated,
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
either
an
appropriate
res
judicata
bar
to
their
doing
so,
nor
do
we
think
there
can
be
a
collateral
stopple
issue
except
just
to
matters
which
we
are
actually
litigating.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
well,
the
problem
there
your
honor
is
that
many
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
well,
that
is
not
quite
accurate.
for
the
reason
that
as
their
amended
complaint
shows
which
they
filed
in
january
of
1975,
many
of
their
allegations
concerning
alleged
improper
conduct
on
the
part
of
vendo
concerned
various
pleadings
which
vendo
filed
in
the
state
proceeding
claim,
bad
faith,
for
example
that
at
one
point
in
the
litigation
there
was
a
trade
secret
theory
which
was
rejected
by
the
illinois
courts.
so
that,
to
that
extent,
on
the
basis
of
their
very
complaint
which
goes
into
almost
archeological
detail
concerning
the
state
proceedings,
they
have
made
much
of
the
state
proceeding
and
interval
part
of
the
federal
case.
this
is
not,
i
would
point
out
to
mr.
justice
stevens
in
further
answer
to
his
question
earlier
that
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
a
federal
action
is
alleged
to
be,
let
us
say,
one
part
of
a
sweeping
panorama
which
might
be
appropriate
as
evidence
in
a
large
scale
antitrust
case.
if
one
looks
at
the
allegations
of
the
amended
complaint
filed
by
these
gentlemen
in
january
1975,
you
will
find
almost
item
by
item
objection
to
certain
decisions
which
were
made
by
the
state
court
in
the
state
proceeding,
and
conduct
of
the,
with
respect
to
the
filing
of
pleading,
making
of
arguments,
the
timing
of
motions,
in
the
state
preceding
on
part
of
that.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
would
be
making
the
section
2283
argument
which
of
course
is
an
absolute
and
a
categorical
prohibition.
we
still
would
have
that
problem
because
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
no,
your
honor,
my
argument
would
have
to
be
more
limited,
and
that
is
why
this
case
is
such
an
extreme
case
calling
for,
i
believe
appropriate
relief
from
this
court.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
well,
we
would
be
back
on
2283
your
honor,
and
then
you
would
have
a
more
difficult
comity
federalism
issue
because
then
you
would
have
the
situation
where
a
defense
that
actually
been
presented
and
presumably
rejected
if
the
judgments
were
nevertheless
entered.
it
would
be
a
more
difficult
case.
but
in
the
situation
here,
given
the
finality
of
the
judgments,
the
deliberate
rejection
is
not
a
failure
to
avail
themselves
with
a
federal
defense.
but
the
deliberate
rejection
of
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
have
this
adjudicated,
this
case
is
beyond
the
(inaudible).
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
would
not
your
honor
urge
that
stay
of
the
federal
case
and
indeed
at
least
two
circuits,
the
second
circuit
alliance
case
and
the
ninth
circuit
in
mactronix
(ph)
have
held
that
in
such
circumstances
this
treble
damage
action
in
the
federal
court
should
not
be
stayed.
that
is
not
our
argument.
but
i
would
point
out
that
in
alliance
case
at
the
same
time
that
judge
hand
held
that
a
stay
of
the
federal
case
was
inappropriate.
but
in
that
same
case,
an
attempt
was
made
to
enjoin
the
state
judgment
and
the
second
circuit
held,
no
that
was
entirely
improper.
they
held
that
it
was
barred
by
section
2283.
now,
just
so
that
we
understand
what
the
factual
situation
is,
during
the
period
1959-1964,
mr.
harry
stoner
was
both
the
director
and
officer
of
vendo
receiving
his
salary
of
$50,000
a
year.
the
illinois
supreme
court
held
that
at
that
very
time
while
he
was
on
the
payroll
of
vendo
and
serving
as
a
director
and
officer,
that
stoner
had
violated
his
fiduciary
duties
through
misconduct
of
the
most
flagrant
sort
by
secretly
organizing
and
financing
another
vending
machine
manufacturer,
by
secretly
developing
a
new
type
of
machine
which
vendo
itself
had
been
venally
trying
to
develop,
by
deceitfully
misrepresenting
stoner?s
relationship
with
the
new
company,
and
by
misappropriating
a
corporate
opportunity
rightfully
belonging
to
vendo.
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
its
opinion
by
judge
schaefer
affirmed
the
judgments
on
the
basis
of
those
violations
of
fiduciary
duties
quite
apart
-
it
should
be
noted
-
quite
apart
and
regardless
of
court
said,
if
any
liability
that
might
be
imposed
based
on
the
non
competition
governance.
after
the
illinois
supreme
court
denied
rehearing,
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
1975.
now,
in
1975,
these
judgments
were
clearly
final.
they
clearly
were
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit,
and
they
were,
if
anything,
overwrite
for
collection.
towards
that
end,
vendo
had
commenced
supplementary
proceedings
in
the
state
court
to
collect
these
judgments.
now,
in
an
effort
to
stop
those
proceedings
the
state
defendants
sought
stays
from
illinois
supreme
court,
the
illinois
trial
court,
the
illinois
appellate
court,
and
then
mr.
justice
rehnquist
as
circuit
justice.
all
these
stays
were
denied.
then
at
that
point,
the
state
defendants
turned
to
the
federal
district
court
and
obtained
a
preliminary
injunction
here
in
issue.
the
injunction
prohibits
taking
any
further
steps
to
enforce
or
collect
or
attempt
to
enforce
or
collect
the
final
state
judgments
and
specifically
refers
to
these
supplementary
proceedings
pending
in
the
state
courts.
preliminary
injunction
was
sought
on
two
grounds:
one
ground
was
that
the
respondents
had
allegedly
been
denied
due
process
in
the
state
proceeding.
the
other
as
i
mentioned
was
this
antitrust
issue
which
had
been
specifically
raised
in
the
state
court,
specifically
held
by
illinois
court
to
be
within
their
jurisdiction,
and
then
specifically
withdrawn
before
trial
by
the
state
defendants.
in
its
decision
the
district
court
held
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
to
consider
to
due
process
issue
on
the
ground
that
only
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
review
a
final
state
judgment.
nevertheless,
the
district
court
granted
the
injunction
on
the
antitrust
claim
on
the
ground
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
had
not
passed
on
the
antitrust
issue.
notwithstanding,
in
fact,
that
the
only
the
illinois
supreme
court
had
not
passed
on
the
issue
was
because
the
state
defendants
had
deliberately
withdrawn
that
issue
and
refused
to
reassert
it
at
any
time
thereafter.
now,
i
have
emphasized
very
briefly,
if
it
please
the
court,
what
i
think
the
principal
issues
are
and
we
have
canvassed
those
issues
in
our
brief.
i
would
like
to
briefly
state
so
that
there
can
be
no
confusion
on
this.
i
would
like
to
briefly
state
what
i
think
are
not
the
issues
that
are
presented
here.
to
begin
with,
there
is
no
issue
here
as
to
personal
liberty
or
civil
rights.
there
is
no
issue
as
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts
to
enter
the
judgments
in
question.
there
can
be
no
issue
as
to
due
process
or
the
fairness
of
the
state
proceeding,
in
fact
the
district
judge
so
held.
there
can
be
no
issue
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
illinois
common
law
concerning
the
fiduciary
duties,
corporate
directors
and
officers.
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
stoner?s
guilt
of
the
most
egregious
violations
of
those
rules.
there
can
be
no
issue
as
to
the
meritorious
nature
of
vendo?s
claims
in
the
state
proceeding,
there
is
nothing
baseless
or
sham
about
those
claims.
all
five
courts
in
the
illinois
system
that
dealt
with
this
upheld
the
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
think
that
is
correct
your
honor.
the
only
reason
being
that
it
seemed
to
me,
as
an
advocate,
appropriate
that
we
narrow
the
issues
for
a
resolution
by
this
court.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
but
we,
of
course,
do
not
in
the
slightest
acknowledge
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
right,
and
furthermore
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief
the
district
court
issued
this
caveat
in
its
opinion.
the
court
said
the
findings
here
are
interlocutory
in
nature
based
on
incomplete
record
and
of
course
the
complete
trial
directed
to
the
issues
might
produce
evidence
requiring
a
different
or
more
limited
result.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
absolutely
correct
your
honor.
there
can
also
be
no
question
of
the
opportunity
provided
by
the
illinois
state
court
for
adjudication
of
the
federal
antitrust
defense.
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
state
defendants
deliberately
rejected
that
opportunity.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
only
with
respect
to
the
non
2283
issues.
we
do
not
even
think
you
have
to
reach
that
your
honor
because
this
injunction
we
think
is
clearly
barred
by
section
2283.
it
does
not
fall
within
the
expressly
authorized
exception
or
the
in
aid
of
jurisdiction,
and
indeed
as
we
argue
in
our
brief,
the
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
think
that
it
is
right
your
honor
except
that
in
the
context
of
1983
actions
and
habeas
corpus
actions,
questions
of
comity
and
federalism
they
arise
where
there
has
been
an
adjudication
in
the
state
courts
of
a
federal
defense.
but
we
do
not
have
to
get
into
that.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
and
the
final
judgment,
yes.
i
would
just
conclude
by
stating
relieving
sometimes
to
rebuttal
that
for
nearly
two
years
this
injunction
has
not
only
nullified
the
decision
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
nullified
the
state
proceedings
to
enforce
that
judgment
in
the
illinois
trial
court,
but
it
has,
i
repeat,
nullified
to
that
extent
these
important
state
policies
with
respect
to
fiduciary
conduct.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
would
just
say
finally
your
honor
that
as
a
result
of
what
has
happened
here,
the
respondents
have
managed
so
far
to
avoid
their
adjudicated
liability
for
incontestable
violations
of
state
law
duties.
thank
you.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
oh,
yes,
precisely.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
yes,
it
is
based
instead
on
the
governing
statute
1738
of
the
judicial
code.
we
know
of
no
reason
on
why
in
fact
this
whole
case
could
not
be
disposed
off
on
a
basis
of
full
faith
and
credit.
i
am
utterly
unaware
and
certainly
the
respondent?s
brief
does
not
help
us
in
this
regard.
i
am
utterly
unaware
of
any
reason
why
this,
why
the
full
faith
and
credit
statute
is
not
completely
dispositive
here.
i
know
of
no
exception
to
the
applicability
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
here.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
absolutely,
it
would
not
even
be
necessary
to
reach
the
questions
of
2283
or
comity
and
federalism.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
oh,
no.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
it
is
a
statute,
section
1738
of
the
judicial
code
specifically
provides
that
federal
courts
shall
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
state
court
judgments
in
precisely
the
same
way
that
other
state
court
shall,
and
there
has
been
no
indications
so
far
as
we
are
aware
of
any
conceivable
exception
to
the
full
faith
and
credit
requirement.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
in
those
three
minutes,
i
would
like
to
make
three
very
brief
points.
first
of
all
with
respect
to
the
treble
damage
suit
which
is
proceeding
ahead
on
the
trial
court,
mr.
sears
once
again
raises
the
specter
that
vendo,
if
allowed
to
collect
these
judgments
will
obtain
control
of
these
two
corporations
which
stoner
controlled,
lektro-vend
and
stoner
investments.
at
the
district
court,
at
the
court
of
appeals,
and
now
in
the
supreme
court
of
united
states,
we
wish
to
make
clear
that
vendo
will
not
obtain
control
and
indeed,
consent
judgments
to
that
effect
were
offered
in
the
district
court.
so
far
as
taking
control
of
those
two
companies,
so
that
somehow
there
would
be
laws
of
article
iii
jurisdiction
by
virtue
case
or
controversy,
there
simply
is
no
issue.
it
is
at
most
a
red
herring
which
obscures
the
fact
that
the
respondents
do
have
their
treble
damage
remedy,
they
are
proceeding
ahead,
there
is
no
danger
that
those
two
companies
will
be
taken
over
by
vendo,
vendo
does
not
wish
to
have
those
two
companies,
and
they
have
that
very
adequate
remedy,
indeed
their
claim
has
been
that
in
the
treble
damage
case,
they
will
be
able
to
recover
three
times
the
amount
of
the
judgment,
whether
collect
it
or
not.
we
of
course
do
not
act
in
that
position.
second,
i
would
like
to
very
tersely
amplify
my
answer
to
a
series
of
questions
of
mr.
justice
white
directed
to
me,
after
talking
with
my
colleagues
it
appears
that
i
may
have
not
answered
all
aspects
of
mr.
justice
white?s
question.
mr.
justice
white
asked
whether
there
would
be
any
question
other
than
2283
if
the
respondents
had
not
withdrawn
their
federal
antitrust
defense
and
had
actually
litigated
it.
i
think
i
replied
that
there
would
indeed
be
a
significant
comity
federalism
issue
in
terms
of
collateral
stopple,
and
what
the
impact
of
that
adjudication
would
be
in
the
federal
preceding.
furthermore,
if
they
had
never
raised
the
defense
in
the
state
proceeding
and
simply
had
ignored
it,
there
would
a
significant
question
your
honor
under
the
huffman
case
with
respect
to
the
propriety
of
an
injunction
against
the
state
court
proceeding,
if
it
is
true
that
there
is
an
adequate
opportunity
to
have
presented
that
question
in
the
state
proceeding.
on
the
other
hand,
if
there
was
no
opportunity
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
well,
there
is
no
dispute
here
your
honor
that
no
one
is
attempting
to
deprive
them
of
the
right
to
present
their
treble
damage
claim.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
well,
because
huffman
was
seeking
only
injunctive
relief.
in
this
instance,
we
are
talking
only
about
a
comity
federalism
bar
to
an
injunction.
we
are
not,
in
any
sense,
taking
the
position
that
they
are
precluded
from
maintaining
their
treble
damage
remedy.
finally,
third
point,
one
of
the
really
key
issues
here,
the
threshold
issue,
i
think
is
the
2283
issue.
we
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
review
that
issue
as
fully
as
we
should.
we
urge
review
of
our
briefs
particularly
with
respect
to
what
we
believe
to
be
the
utter
distortion
of
the
mitchum
decision
and
the
fact
that
adoption
of
the
decision
below,
with
respect
to
the
expressly
authorized
exception,
would
apply
to
literally
dozens
of
federal
statutes
which
we
have
set
forth
at
pages
10
and
11
of
our
reply
brief,
which
are
in
every
respect
identical
to
section
16
of
the
clayton
act
for
purposes
of
obtaining
injunctive
relief.
thank
you
very
much.
