unknown
speaker
did
you
make
the
same
statement
about
a
rhode
island
citizen?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
fishery
is
a
unique
and
important
aspect
of
the
economic
life
of
the
common
wealth
of
the
state,
etcetera,
etcetera,
etcetera.
unknown
speaker
and
therefore?
unknown
speaker
the
taking
of
them
maybe
reserved
for
citizens.
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
state
could
simply
say,
no
nonresidents
may
or
no
non-citizens
may
fish
in
our
waters.
unknown
speaker
and
when
the
fish
swim
out
of
massachusetts’s
waters
into
rhode
island,
what
are
the
schools?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
we
had
a
migratory
fish?
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
we
are
talking
about
ownership.
unknown
speaker
so
ownership
shifts
as
the
fish
migrate
up
and
down
the
seaport
states?
unknown
speaker
now,
toomer
seem
to
think
that
ownership
language
is
not
a
matured
hand
for
regulatory
power,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
cases
against
nonresidents,
non-citizens
may
not
own
land
in
the
states.
unknown
speaker
but
the
state
will
not
forbid
foresting
of
the
state
owned
forest.
unknown
speaker
if
they
had
called
for
bids
or
the
proposals
to
cut
timber,
they
could
reserve
that
for
citizens.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
sale
of
tax
forfeited
property,
could
that
be
limited
to
citizens
of
the
state,
residents?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
oil
and
gas
on
the
state
owned
land?
unknown
speaker
so
the
of
the
placing
of
oil
in
the
three-mile
belt,
it
could
be
limited
to
–
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
some
support
from
that?
unknown
speaker
anything
else?
unknown
speaker
well
state
owned
and
what
they
do
about
it?
unknown
speaker
they
could
be
then
anybody
killing
them
for
the
purpose
of
taking
them
out
of
state.
unknown
speaker
but
they
did
not
attempt
to
keep
the
nonresidents
from
killing
them?
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
feel
that
mccready
and
toomer
are
reconcilable
completely?
unknown
speaker
state
owned
parks
maybe
restricted
to
citizen
users.
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn’t
you,
perhaps?
unknown
speaker
what
wares
them
out?
unknown
speaker
it
wares
them
out.
the
facilities
on
them
have
to
be
replaced
more
often
if
they
are
used
twice
as
much.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
state
cannot
do
it,
what
would
you
say
the
constitutional
reason
would
be?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
whitehead,
could
i
just
ask
you
a
question
about
your
basic
theory?
as
i
understand
here,
the
fish
are
owned
by
the
state
of
massachusetts
before
they
reduce
the
possession
and
some
individuals
but
not
others
have
a
right
to
reduce
them
to
possession.
unknown
speaker
which
individuals
may
reduce
fish
to
possession?
unknown
speaker
and
what
gives
them
that
right,
their
citizenship,
is
it
a
privilege
of
their
citizenship
that
gives
them
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
they
have
to
be
resident
citizens?
unknown
speaker
is
that
always
true,
a
citizen
of
massachusetts
could
not
reside
temporarily
across
the
borders?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
his
citizenship
which
gives
him
the
privilege
of
taking
this
fish
for
himself.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
say,
one
fish
is
swimming
along,
he
has
only
a
very
fractional
interest
in
it,
then
if
he
catches
it,
he
has
got
the
whole
fish?
unknown
speaker
now,
what
gives
him
the
privilege
to
do
that,
it
is
his
privilege
of
his
citizenship,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
he
is
the
owner
of
the
piece
of
the
fish,
he
is
not
owner
of
the
whole
fish.
unknown
speaker
but
what
gives
him
the
right
to
take
the
whole
fish?
is
it
not
that
it
is
a
privilege
of
his
citizenship?
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
that
the
state
could
not
open
it
up
to
non
citizens?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
would
be
taking
the
citizen’s
property.
unknown
speaker
so
it
legislates.
for
whom
does
it
reserve
the
fishery?
unknown
speaker
and
so
it
is,
as
brother
stevens
says,
an
incident
to
a
citizenship.
right
under
the
statute,
it
is
an
incident
to
a
citizenship.
unknown
speaker
well
it
is
because
they
are
under
the
state;
the
fishery
is
reserved
to
them
by
the
statute.
that
is
the
class
that
has
defined,
who
are
privileged
to
fish
--
citizens,
and
hence
it
is
a
function
of
a
citizenship.
unknown
speaker
and
yet
the
state
could
give
it
away
for.
unknown
speaker
but
the
citizen
loses
its
interest
once
the
fish
is
out
of
the
water.
unknown
speaker
and
he
is
free
to
take
it
out
of
the
state?
unknown
speaker
in
common
terms?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
get
the
property
providing
the
fishes
in
there,
if
the
fishes
over
the
rhode
island
are
not
your
property?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
only
your
property
when
it
is
visiting?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
visiting
property.
unknown
speaker
now
you
see
it
and
now
you
don’t.
unknown
speaker
mr.
whitehead,
does
your
position
depend
on
the
submerged
lands
act?
unknown
speaker
as
i
read
in
his
dissent
that
he
relied
almost
exclusively
on
that.
unknown
speaker
but
if
that
act
had
not
been
passed,
do
you
still
think
that
chapter
35
would
be
valid?
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
avoid
toomer
then?
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
get
around
toomer?
unknown
speaker
so
absent
the
federal
act,
we
would
have
to
over
rule,
toomer
to
support
your
position.
unknown
speaker
the
submerged
lands
act
did
in
fact
over
rule
united
states
against
california
so
far
as
land
within
the
three-mile
land.
unknown
speaker
it
altered
the
ownership
relationship.
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
said
--
what
did
toomer
say?
toomer
said
no
one
owns
the
fish?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
suppose
that
the
congress
could
grant
something
that
it
did
not
have.
unknown
speaker
so
you
must
say
that
congress
owned
the
fish
or
that
united
states
owned
the
fish.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
congress
is
essentially
in
the
submerged
land
act
was
asserting
a
claim
of
ownership
that
toomer
said
it
did
not
have?
unknown
speaker
older
cases?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
that
toomer
would
stand
for
the
proposition
that
neither
the
state
nor
the
federal
government
together
possessed
ownership?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
toomer
would
have
said
that
if
the
federal
government
and
the
state
governments
had
gone
together
and
banned
foreign
fishing
within
the
three
mile
limit,
that
law
would
be
banned?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
includes
doing
business
with
the
property
of
the
state?
let
us
just
assume
for
the
moment
that
a
state
does
put
out
bits
for
timber
cutting.
do
you
think
it
may
confine
those
invitations
to
the
state
to
the
citizens?
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
included
in
your
statement?
unknown
speaker
mr.
vetter
can
i
go
back
to
justice
white’s
question,
didn’t
our
alexandria
scrap
decision
last
spring,
indicate
that
the
state
of
maryland
was
free
to,
in
a
purely
proprietary
capacity
to
favor
maryland.
scrap
people
over
non
maryland
scrap
people?
unknown
speaker
but
those
burrows
were
in
federal
land,
weren’t
they?
unknown
speaker
missouri
against
holland
involved
the
federal
migratory
birds
act
and
the
treaty
power
--
unknown
speaker
i
remember.
unknown
speaker
you
can
take
(inaudible)
or
would
not
take
it
at
all?
unknown
speaker
mr.
vetter
would
your
analysis
carry
over
to
wild
animals
on
land?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
police
power
is
subject
to
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
unknown
speaker
well,
so
how
does
the
modern
management
tool
of
the
police
power
solve
any
of
the
problems
that
the
states
see
as
confronting
them?
unknown
speaker
what
if
a
state
wants
a
$500.00
license
from
a
non
resident
to
hunt
antelope
and
a
$10.00
license
from
residents
to
hunt
antelope,
any
constitutional
objection
to
that?
unknown
speaker
that
puts
it
just
on
the
reasoning
than
of
the
inspection
fee
cases
that
you
can
charge
if
it
costs
more.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
state
of
massachusetts
determined
that
it
could
only
issue
fishing
licenses
for
this
particular
kind
of
fish,
because
there
are
just
weren’t
many
running.
only
50
fishermen
had
much
of
a
chance
of
catching
them,
now
do
you
think
it
could
reserve,
let
us
say
40
of
those
for
residents
of
massachusetts?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
presumably,
residents
of
oregon
or
nevada
or
minnesota
too.
unknown
speaker
and
so,
if
all
50
licenses
ended
up
in
the
hands
of
nonresidents,
there
is
nothing
massachusetts
can
do
about?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
i
was
sure
they
can.
unknown
speaker
does
your
view
stand
primarily
on
the
fact
that
you
were
dealing
with
migratory
fish?
suppose
you
had
fish
in
an
inland
pond,
let
us
say
bass
or
trent
and
the
state
exacted
a
much
higher
license
fee
for
nonresidents
to
fish
in
those
inland
lakes
or
ponds,
and
that
would
be
a
conservation
move
perhaps
--
how
would
you
view
that?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
limiting
this
concept
to
the
migratory
propensities
of
the
wild
life,
are
you?
in
other
words,
in
a
state
like
minnesota
or
wisconsin,
you
have
practically
nothing
except
domestic
indigenous
fish,
they
do
not
migrate
anywhere.
but
they
charge,
a
great
deal
more
for
an
out
of
state
license.
do
you
say
as
long
as
that
license
is
not
so
great
disparity
as
to
be
obviously
discriminatory
or
penalizing
in
its
nature,
that
it
is
alright
to
have
this.
unknown
speaker
i
misunderstood
you,
i
thought
you
said
that,
a
differential
in
the
--
the
price
of
a
license
could
be
constitutionally
justified
only
if
you
could
show
that
it
would
cost
that
much
more
to
administer
to
enforce
the
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
vetter,
suppose
we
have
a
big
lake
in
massachusetts
with
a
whole
lot
of
bass,
as
my
brother
powell
is
talking
about
and
the
state
says,
we
do
not
get
out
of
the
bass
business
and
therefore
all
of
the
citizens
of
the
state
take
all
of
the
fish
they
want
but
though
nonresidents.
is
that
alright?
because
i
warn
you,
if
you
don’t
–
if
that
is
alright,
then
if
the
state
said,
i
am
going
to
give
all
my
citizen
a
100
bucks,
then
all
of
the
farmers
could
come
in
and
get
100
bucks.
unknown
speaker
scariati’s
case
involved,
sponge
fishing.
unknown
speaker
the
effort
of
florida
to
control
that,
within
its
territorial
waters,
based
upon
its
police
power?
unknown
speaker
and
upheld
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
what
is
so
magic
about
the,
calling
something
as
the
police
power,
a
state,
and
the
exercise
of
any
of
its
powers
is
limited
by
the
federal
constitution?
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
change
the
matter
if
all
of
the
state’s
police
power..
unknown
speaker
an
absolutist
right
to
deal
with
wealth.
unknown
speaker
you
do
concede
this
power?
unknown
speaker
on
the
other
hand,
the
problem
with
your
submission
is,
is
how
you
even
handed
this
must
be.
your
submission
leads
logically
to
the
conclusion,
i
suppose,
that
a
state
simply
could
not
charge
a
differential
and
price
between
a
resident
and
a
non
resident
fishing
license
for
example,
and
it
is
inland
waters.
unless,
it
could
show
that
it
costs
somehow
more
to
enforce
its
fish
laws
against
nonresidents
than
it
does
against
residents.
unknown
speaker
that
might
be
the
case
from
what
i
have
heard
with
respect
to
peasants
in
the
dakotas.
i
am
not
a
peasant
hunter
but
i
understand
there
are
only
two
or
three
states
in
the
union
that
have
an
abundance
of
peasants
and
that
nonresidents
that
shall
address
substantial
fee
is
otherwise,
that
the
tens
of
thousands
of
people
in
land
to
shoot
the
peasants
out.
unknown
speaker
mr.
vetter,
did
i
understand
here
to
draw
a
distinction
between
possibly
inland
lakes
a
little
while
ago,
i
take
it
you
would
make
the
same
argument
with
respect
to
boundary
river
waters
and
certainly
the
great
lakes,
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
sometimes
the
east
coast
forgets
those
things.
unknown
speaker
i
will
accept
the
toomer
opinion
and
correct
me
if
i
am
mistaken;
did
rely
on
the
california
case,
didn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
and
the
california
case
was
a
turned
around,
180
degrees
by
the
submerged
lands
act
and
to
that
extent
the
one
of
the
foundations
for
the
toomer
opinion
was
removed.
unknown
speaker
no
but
it
did
turn
it
around
180
degrees.
unknown
speaker
and
what
was
held
in
the
california
case
to
belong
to
the
federal
government
under
the
submerged
lands
act
now
belongs
to
the
states,
i.e.
the
three-mile
belt.
unknown
speaker
mr.
vetter,
do
you
rely
at
all
on
the
distinction
between
two
kinds
of
ownership
that
are
discussed
in
the
toomer
case
as
a
footnote
on
the
difference
between
dominium
and
imperium.
do
you
rely
on
that
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose,
one
might
argue
that
if
that
footnote
is
read
to
mean
that
ownership
in
the
mccready
case
as
in
the
imperium
or
regulatory
sense,
one
could
also
construe
ownership
in
the
statute
changing
the
california
result
in
the
same
sense.
unknown
speaker
thank
you
mr.
vetter,
you
have
--.
