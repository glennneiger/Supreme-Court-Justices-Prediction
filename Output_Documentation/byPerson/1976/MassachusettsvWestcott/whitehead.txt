mr.
whitehead
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts.
it
involves
the
criminal
action
brought
by
massachusetts
against
jack
b.
westcott
for
violation
of
chapter
35
of
the
acts
and
resolves
of
the
general
court
of
massachusetts
for
the
year
1923.
chapter
35
makes
it
unlawful
during
the
months
of
july,
august
and
september.
for
any
person
who
has
not
been
a
legal
resident
of
massachusetts
during
the
preceding
year
to
use
beam
or
otter
trawls
to
direct
a
fish
and
certain
of
the
waters
of
vineyard
sound.
vineyard
sound
is
a
body
of
water
lying
between
the
island
of
martha’s
vineyard
and
the
elizabeth
islands,
off
the
coast
of
massachusetts.
the
sole
issue
before
the
court
today
is
where
the
chapter
35,
and
so
far
as
it
differentiates
between
residents
and
non-residents
of
massachusetts,
violates
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
contained
in
article
4
section
2
of
the
constitution.
the
facts
maybe
briefly
stated.
mr.
westcott
is
a
resident
of
rhode
island.
on
september
5th,
1973,
he
undertook
to
drag
by
means
of
an
otter
trawl
for
scup
and
fluke,
which
are
migratory
fish
in
the
waters
described
by
chapter
35.
he
was
thereupon
arrested
by
an
officer
of
the
massachusetts
department
of
natural
resources
and
charged
with
violating
statute.
on
april
24th,
1974,
he
was
tried
and
found
guilty
of
this
violation
by
the
district
court
of
massachusetts.
upon
his
conviction
in
the
district
court,
he
pursued
his
rights
under
massachusetts’s
law,
to
do
an
over-review
in
the
superior
court.
however,
in
lieu
of
the
trial
in
the
superior
court,
the
parties
filed
an
agreed
statement
of
facts.
westcott
then
presented
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
action
based
upon
two
grounds.
first,
the
chapter
35
violates
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
contained
in
article
4
section
2
and
second,
that
it
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
superior
court
reserved
decision
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
reported
the
constitutional
questions
to
the
appeals
court
of
massachusetts.
shortly
thereafter,
the
supreme
judicial
court
granted
direct
appellant
review.
on
march
12,
1976,
without
ruling
on
equal
protection
claim,
the
supreme
judicial
court
declared
that
chapter
35
does
violate
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
in
order
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
be
allowed.
it
is
our
position
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
erred
in
finding
chapter
35
unconstitutional.
i
would
like
to
begin
my
argument
by
discussing
the
relationship
between
the
fisheries
of
massachusetts
and
the
state.
i
will
then
proceed
to
the
constitutional
doctrine
by
which
we
believe
this
court
has
given
recognition
to
that
kind
of
interest.
the
fisheries
of
massachusetts
are
one
of
the
most
important
natural
resources
of
the
state.
in
economic
terms
they
provide
the
basis
for
one
of
the
states
most
significant
industries.
equally
as
important
as
economics
though,
they
furnished
the
basis
for
a
unique
way
of
life
for
many
of
the
states
citizens.
that
way
of
life
is
exemplified
in
such
well
known
seaports
as
nantucket
and
new
bedford
and
gives
the
state
a
quality
distinct
from
that,
which
other
states
have.
mr.
whitehead
what
statement
is
that,
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
understand
the
question?
mr.
whitehead
i
think
it
is
more
likely
that
the
fisheries
of
rhode
island
would
be
greater
interest
to
a
rhode
island
resident
than
would
be
in
the
fisheries
of
massachusetts.
although,
of
course,
mr.
westcott
contends
that
he
is
also
interested
in
the
fisheries
of
massachusetts.
however,
the
fisheries
of
massachusetts,
i
think,
account
for
a
way
of
life
in
massachusetts,
which
is
somewhat
unique
from
that,
rhode
island,
new
hampshire,
or
any
of
the
other
coastal
states.
they
serve
as
a
major
reason
why
many
people
come
to
live
within
massachusetts
and
why
many
others
who
were
born
there
remain.
in
short,
they
constitute
a
primary
factor
underlying
the
state’s
continuing
vitality.
however,
just
as
they
are
an
important
resource,
the
fisheries
of
massachusetts
are
a
fragile
one.
they
are
therefore
worthy
of
special
protection
by
the
state.
it
is
our
position
that
this
court
has
set
forth
a
framework,
which
gives
recognition
to
the
unique
interest,
which
the
state
possesses
in
its
natural
resources.
in
the
past
it
has
used
that
framework
to
answer
challenges
brought
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
specifically,
in
cases
such
as
mccready
v.
virginia,
geer
v.
connecticut,
and
patsone
v.
pennsylvania,
the
court
has
ruled
that
the
citizens
of
a
state
possess
in
a
collective
capacity
a
property
interest
in
the
state’s
resources.
the
court
has
further
ruled
that
accordingly,
the
right
of
those
citizens
to
use
the
state’s
resources
is
not
a
right
derived
from
the
citizenship
per
se
but
rather
a
right
derived
from
their
citizenship
and
their
property
combined.
it
is
therefore
not
a
privilege
or
immunity
of
citizenship
guaranteed
to
the
citizens
of
other
states
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
on
only
one
occasion
has
the
court
departed
from
this
analysis,
that
was
in
toomer
v.
whitsel
decided
in
1948.
in
toomer,
the
court
held
that
the
right
of
the
citizens
of
south
carolina
to
take
migratory
shrimp
from
the
three-mile
marginal
belt
located
off
of
that
state’s
coastline
was
not
a
property
right
but
rather
was
a
privilege
or
immunity
of
citizenship.
as
such
it
was
not
a
right
which
could
be
denied
to
the
citizens
of
other
states.
massachusetts
concedes
that
if
toomer
controls
here,
chapter
35
must
be
held
unconstitutional.
however,
we
contend
that
toomer,
no
longer
serves
as
valid
precedent.
the
court
in
toomer
declared
that
south
carolina
did
not
posses
an
ownership
interest
in
the
shrimp
for
two
reasons.
first,
it
was
the
court’s
view
that
migratory
animals
are
by
their
nature
inherently
incapable
of
being
owned.
second,
a
prior
decision
of
the
court
had
held
that
that
federal
government
possesses
paramount
control
of
the
resources
of
the
marginal
sea
such
that
none
of
those
resources
is
susceptible
to
state
ownership.
the
second
basis
of
the
court’s
decision
in
toomer
,
namely
that
the
resources
of
the
three-mile
belt
and
one
of
the
paramount
control
of
the
federal
government
has
been
completely
undermined
by
the
passage
of
this
submerged
lands
act
in
1953.
by
that
legislation,
congress
expressly
conveyed
to
the
states
both
title
two
and
ownership
in
all
the
resources
of
the
marginal
sea.
accordingly,
the
states
now
possess
the
same
rights
of
ownership
in
those
resources
as
this
court
had
held
them
to
possess
with
respect
to
human
resources.
thus,
if
toomer
has
to
control
at
all
in
this
case,
it
must
be
on
the
first
ground
articulated
by
the
court,
namely
that
migratory
animals
are
by
their
nature
inherently
incapable
of
being
owned.
that
ground
finds
no
support
in
prior
supreme
court
adjudication.
this
court
had
never
before
held
that
a
state’s
ownership
in
migratory
animals
differed
from
its
ownership
in
stationary
animals.
even
more
significantly,
the
congresses,
when
it
passed
the
submerged
lands
act
to
know
such
distinction.
in
its
conveyance,
it
conveyed
title
and
ownership
to
all
the
resources
of
the
marginal
sea,
specifically
all
fish.
we
submit
that
the
relative
mobility
of
the
given
species
is
an
illusive
concept.
that
being
true,
the
appropriateness
of
the
distinction
based
upon
that
concept
is
a
matter
best
left
to
congressional
analysis.
in
this
instance,
congress
has
determined
that
mobility
is
not
the
criteria
and
upon
which
important
right
should
turn
and
that
being
the
case,
this
court
should
respect
this
judgment.
we
submit
that
the
court
should
now
find
that
migratory
fish
located
in
the
three-mile
belt
are
in
fact
owned
by
the
respective
states.
mr.
whitehead
and
therefore,
the
right
to
take
those
fish
is
a
property
right
and
not
a
privilege
or
immunity
of
citizenship.
mr.
whitehead
that
is
correct.
mr.
whitehead
that
is
correct,
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
mr.
whitehead
scup
and
fluke
do
not
have
that
kind
of
migratory
characteristics.
mr.
whitehead
at
that
point,
when
the
fish
are
in
rhode
island,
it
is
rhode
island
that
has
the
special
interest
in
those
fish.
mr.
whitehead
and
the
proprietary
interest
in
those
fish.
mr.
whitehead
that
would
be
true
of
fish
that
migrate
up
and
down
the
coast.
however,
we
submit
that
our
case
is…
mr.
whitehead
but
that
statement
in
toomer
applies
directly
in
the
face
of
several
decisions
decided
by
this
court
prior
to
that
time.
the
most
significant
of
which
is
mccready
v.
virginia.
mr.
whitehead
all
we
are
talking
about
here
is
public
property,
if
it
bars
non-citizens
from
acquiring
private
proprietary.
mr.
whitehead
that
is
correct.
mr.
whitehead
that
is
correct,
i
think
that
is…
mr.
whitehead
if
that
were
deemed
public
property
of
the
state
--
and
i
think
it
would
be,
i
believe
the
state
could
restrict
the
--
mr.
whitehead
it
would
be
particularly
true
with
respect
to
oil
and
gas.
mr.
whitehead
that
is
correct,
but
we
are
not
saying
that
--
mr.
whitehead
i
think
mccready
v.
virginia
is
the
primary
support.
mr.
whitehead
geer
v.
connecticut
said
that
he
state-owned
wild
birds
in
the
state;
patsone
v.
pennsylvania
said
that
the
--
mr.
whitehead
in
geer
v.
connecticut
which
was
a
commerce
clause
case,
they
could
prevent
the
killing
of
those
birds
for
the
purpose
of
taking
them
out
of
state.
mr.
whitehead
that
is
correct.
the
village
in
mccready
v.
virginia…
mr.
whitehead
no
the
statute
prohibited
the
killing
of
game
for
the
purpose
of
taking
them
out
of
state.
however
in
mccready
v.
virginia,
virginia
prohibited
nonresidents
from
taking
oysters
within
the
state’s
waters.
the
court
held
that
the
state
owned
those
oysters
and
the
right
of
assistance
to
take
them
was
a
property
right
and
not
a
privilege
or
immunity
of
citizenship.
mr.
whitehead
even
at
the
time
the
cases
were
decided,
they
were
irreconcilable
in
this
respect.
toomer
found
a
distinction
between
migratory
and
stationary
animals,
which
the
mccready
court
did
not
find.
although
the
animals
involved
in
mccready
were
stationary,
the
court
there
used
language,
which
clearly
indicated
the
court
view
that
free
swimming
fish
were
also
capable
of
ownership
by
the
state.
of
course
they
are
not
able
to
be
reduced
by
possession
but
the
ownership
is
similar
to
the
ownership,
which
a
person
who
holds
private
property
has
and
the
animals
found
on
that
property,
he
can
exclude
others
from
coming
on
to
the
property
to
take
the
animals
located
on.
mr.
whitehead
well,
if
you
are
talking
about
using
it
in
terms
of
just
going
on
to
the
park,
i
am
not
sure
that
we
are
arguing
that
the
law
goes
that
far.
mr.
whitehead
because
it
does
not
impinge
upon
the
proprietary
interest
which
the
state
holds
and…
mr.
whitehead
pardon
me.
mr.
whitehead
there
is
some
difficult
line
drawing
there,
we
would...
mr.
whitehead
if
the
state
could
not
prohibit,
it
would
have
to
come
under
the
equal
protection
clause
and
not
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
mr.
whitehead
because
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
does
not
protect
proprietary
rights,
merely
privileges
or
immunities
of
citizenship.
the
equal
protection
clause
is
not
concerned
with
simply
proprietary
but
privileges
and
immunities
to
citizenship
that
extends
to
all
kinds
of
rights.
we
would
therefore
submit
that
neither
of
the
premises
underlying
toomer
has
common
strength.
accordingly,
toomer
itself
should
not
be
deemed
controlling
of
this
case
on
the
basis
of
its
prior
decisions,
the
court
should
rule
that
chapter
35
is
constitutional.
mr.
whitehead
that
is
correct.
mr.
whitehead
it
would
be
the
citizens
of
massachusetts.
mr.
whitehead
no,
that
fact
that
as
citizens
and
therefore
residents
of
massachusetts,
they
--
mr.
whitehead
well
they
would
not
be
citizens
if
they
were
not
residents.
mr.
whitehead
oh
temporarily
he
could
reside
across
the
border
but
his
legal
residence
would
have
to
be
in
massachusetts.
mr.
whitehead
well,
it
is
both
his
citizenship
and
the
fact
that
as
a
citizen,
he
possesses
a
property
interest
along
with
all
the
other
citizens
in
the
resource.
i
am
saying
if
–
mr.
whitehead
that
is
correct.
mr.
whitehead
there
is
one
step
in
between.
as
a
citizen,
he
is
the
owner
of
the
fish
and
therefore
it
is
his.
mr.
whitehead
that
is
correct.
mr.
whitehead
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
is
a
fact
that
all
the
citizens
of
massachusetts,
all
possess
an
equal
ownership
interest
and
the
right
to
take
all
of
the
fish.
mr.
whitehead
it
could
open
it
up
to
non
citizens.
mr.
whitehead
the
state
has
to
exercise
the
property
right
or
it
holds
the
property
right
and
trust
for
the
citizens.
mr.
whitehead
it
reserves
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
citizens.
mr.
whitehead
the
citizens,
because
they
are
owners
of
the
property.
mr.
whitehead
i
think
not,
your
honor,
it
is
a
function
of
their
property
and
it
is
coincidental
but
those
who
have
the
property
interest,
they
are
also
citizens.
that
is
why
they
have
the
property
interest.
mr.
whitehead
they
give
it
away
if
they
found
that
it
was
in
the
interest
of
those
citizens
in
their
collective
capacity
to
in
fact
give
this
fish
away.
mr.
whitehead
that
is
correct;
it
is
reduced
to
private
property
and
the
collective
ownership
of
the
state
ceases
at
that
point,
all
the
state
has
is
a
police
power
over
the
fish.
mr.
whitehead
that
is
correct.
mr.
whitehead
that
is
correct.
we
are
not
saying
here
that
massachusetts
has
attempted
to
restrict
the
use
of
the
resource
once
it
has
been
taken
to
the
borders
of
the
state,
rather
it
is
restricted
to
the
residents,
the
right
to
take
that
resource
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
whitehead
that
is
correct.
mr.
whitehead
that
is
correct.
mr.
whitehead
it
could
be
characterized
--
mr.
whitehead
that
is
correct.
that
principle
has
its
roots
in
common
law
and
the
rights
of
the
private
property,
when
the
animal
is
found
on
his
property.
you
can
call
it
qualified
property
interest.
mr.
whitehead
it
does
in
fact
--
we
need
the
submerged
lands
act
to
obviate
one
of
the
two
grounds
on
which
toomer
was
based.
mr.
whitehead
that
is
correct.
he
as
we
felt
that
aside
from
the
fact
that
congress
had
conveyed
the
resources
of
the
marginal
sea
to
the
states
and
therefore
obviated
the
marginal
sea
tide
water
distinction.
the
fact
that
congress
had
drawn
no
distinction
between
migratory
and
stationary
animals
was
a
strong
indication
that
no
such
distinction
should
in
fact
be
drawn.
mr.
whitehead
chapter
35
would
be
unconstitutional
then.
mr.
whitehead
pardon
me.
mr.
whitehead
we
could
not
avoid
toomer
in
that
case
because
the
states
would
have
no
proprietary
interest
in
the
three-mile
belt.
mr.
whitehead
i
think
absent
the
federal
act,
you
would
have
not
to
only
to
over
rule
toomer
but
the
cases
on
which
toomer
was
based,
primarily
united
states
v.
california
which
was
the
initial
case,
which
held
that
the
federal
government
possesses
paramount
control
of
the
resources
of
the
marginal
sea.
so
you
have
to
go
one
step
back.
mr.
whitehead
i
am
not
sure,
i
would
characterize
it
as
over
ruling,
us
v.
california.
congress
in
the
submerged
lands
act
exercised
the
rights,
which
united
states
v.
california
had
confirmed
that
it
possessed.
mr.
whitehead
that
is
correct.
mr.
whitehead
toomer
criticized
the
ownership
theory
but
it
in
fact
did
not
over
rule
mccready
v.
virginia,
which
is
the
primary
case
articulating
the
ownership
principle.
mr.
whitehead
that
is
correct.
mr.
whitehead
that
is
correct
and
there
was
language
in
toomer,
which
is
inconsistent
with
that.
a
language
which
says
that
migratory
animals
are
inherently
incapable
of
being
owned,
we
would
assert
that
that
language
contradicts
earlier
decisions
of
the
court
and
that
fact,
coupled
with
the
fact
the
congress
itself
after
careful
inquiry
determine
that
there
should
be
no
distinction
between
migratory
and
stationary
animals.
mr.
whitehead
the
toomer
called
them
to
question
but
mccready
v.
virginia
and
other
cases
confirmed
that
it
had…
mr.
whitehead
that
is
correct.
mr.
whitehead
on
the
basis
of
the
non
migratory
distinction,
i
suppose
it
could
be
argued
that
the
federal
government
did
not
possess
ownership
of
the
migratory
fish
in
the
marginal
sea.
mr.
whitehead
no,
that
kind
of
statute
could
be
enacted
under
powers
apart
from
the
rights
derived
from
property,
it
could
be
enacted
by
the
states
under
the
police
power,
or
by
congress
under
a
variety
of
powers,
particularly
the
commerce
clause,
treaty
clause,
and
property
clause
accordingly
because
we
submit
toomer
as
no
longer
good
law.
we
ask
that
chapter
35
be
held
constitutional
and
that
the
decision
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
be
vacated
and
the
case
be
remanded
for
further
consideration
of
the
other
claims
raised
by
mr.
westcott.
