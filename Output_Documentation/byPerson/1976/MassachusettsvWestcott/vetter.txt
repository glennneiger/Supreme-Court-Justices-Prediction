mr.
vetter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
mr.
westcott
in
this
case
who
as
you
already
know
was
a
rhode
island
fisherman,
fishing
out
of
point
judith.
the
gist
of
my
argument
is
that
he
toomer
and
whitsel
is
still
a
good
law,
but
the
principles
underlying
toomer
and
whitsel
are
still
valid
principles
that
to
resurrect
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
that
my
brother
has
argued
about
would
be
a
giant
step
backwards
and
that
the
states
can
achieve
anything
that
they
legitimately
should
be
able
to
achieve
under
the
police
power.
i
should
emphasize
that
the
fish
that
we
are
dealing
with
in
this
case
are
migratory
fish
that
was
stipulated
in
the
record
below.
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
the
gist
of
it
as
we
see
it
is,
to
bar
a
state
from
discriminating
against
a
citizen
of
another
state
solely
or
substantially
on
the
basis
of
non-citizenship.
it
does
not
bar
it
absolutely
but
when
there
is
a
discrimination,
this
court
has
said
that
the
aliens
or
the
non-citizens
must
be
the
peculiar
source
of
the
evil
at
which
the
statute
is
aimed.
the
purpose
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
i
think
can
be
summed
up
by
saying,
it
is
to
protect
among
other
things
common
callings
and
in
one
of
the
earlier
cases,
ward
v.
maryland,
this
court
said
that
one
of
the
purposes
is
to
allow
a
citizen
of
state
a
to
do
business
and
state
b
on
substantially
the
same
grounds
as
the
citizen
of
state
b.
now
as
we
see
massachusetts’
position
here...
mr.
vetter
no
sir,
i
do
not
think
they
could
and
i
think
that
they...
mr.
vetter
yes
it
is.
as
we
view
massachusetts’s
position,
they
do
not
really
argue
that
the
statute
discriminates
against
non
citizenship.
mr.
vetter
your
honor,
i
confess
that
i
am
not
acquainted
with
that
case
but
i
would
submit
that
the
principles
that
we
are
dealing
with
here
--
principle
based
on
property.
it
is
not
the
basis
for
exercising
a
discrimination.
the
problem
is
we
see
it
with
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
is,
that
it
leads
to
all
sorts
of
consequences
which
i
think,
or
we
submit
would
be
untoward
consequences.
for
example,
in
july
of
last
year,
this
court
decided
kleppe
v.
new
mexico,
involving
the
wild
and
free-roaming
horses
and
burros
act.
that
statute
was
passed
by
the
government
to
protect
those
animals
on
federal
lands.
new
mexico
went
in
to
see
some
of
those
animals.
the
federal
government
agency
asked,
could
they
be
returned.
the
state
of
new
mexico
commenced
an
action
in
the
federal
district
court
and
that
court
held
on
the
basis
of
the
mccready
case
that
the
federal
statute
was
unconstitutional
to
special
public
interest
doctrine.
they
said
that
the
state
of
new
mexico
had
an
ownership
interests
in
these
beasts.
well,
the
court
reversed
and
in
its
reversal,
it
pointed
out
that
the
state
has
power
over
wild
gain
and
its
wild
resources
based
on
the
police
power
but
that
those
powers
have
to
be
subject
to
the
paramount
powers
of
the
federal
constitution
and
it
cited
several
cases
missouri
v.
holland,
which
is
a
very
important
case
in
this
field.
the
hot
case
and
also
toomer
v.
whitsel,
which
of
course
involves
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
mr.
vetter
yes
sir,
they
were,
but
the
point
that
i
am
making
here
is,
and
while
it
may
be
deemed
dictum,
the
court
included
within
the
litany
of
cases
of
paramount
federal
powers
toomer
v.
whitsel
which
is
the
key
case,
which
we
are
dealing
with
on
this
argument
today.
in
toomer
v.
whitsel,
dealt
with
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
and
did
not
deal
with
federal
lands,
it
did
not
deal
with
the
property
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
in
other
words,
we
cite
that
in
our
brief
as
indicative
that
toomer
v.
whitsel
is
still
an
alive
and
vital
case.
mr.
vetter
yes
sir
it
did.
mr.
vetter
yes
sir,
i
admit
that
it
was
dictum
but
nonetheless
it
was
included
within
the
thinking
of
this
court.
we
submit
as
an
example
of
the
paramount
federal
power
to
which
the
state
must
exercise
its
power.
any
event,
as
we
see
massachusetts’s
position,
they
do
not
point
to
aliens
as
a
particular
source
of
evil
and
frankly,
as
we
see
it,
they
do
not
even
try
to
justify
the
statute
as
a
conservation
statute
and
as
you
have
heard
in
their
argument
that
merely
says
that
the
statute
--
they
in
effect
say
that
the
clause
is
inapplicable
because
of
the
special
interest
doctrine
of
mccready
v.
virginia
as
we
see
the
structure
of
their
argument.
now,
that
doctrine
as
my
brother
pointed
out
--
that
doctrine
states
that
the
citizens
own
the
wild
life
of
the
state
in
common,
that
the
state
government
exercises
that
ownership
as
sort
of
a
trustee,
and
that
the
state
government
in
the
exercise
of
that
ownership
can
discriminate
against
non
citizens,
namely
those
who
do
not
have
that
beneficial
interest.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
of
the
state
citizen
derives
from
ownership
and
not
citizenship
and
so,
consequently
that
is
not
a
privilege
of
citizenship
guaranteed
to
citizens
of
other
states.
i
believe
justice
white,
you
were
getting
at
a
point,
which
seems
germane
to
me
and
that
is
that
in
the
mccready
case,
the
court
points
out
that
the
ownership
derives
really
from
two
sources.
it
derives
from
the
citizenship
of
the
state
as
a
state
citizen
and
he
gets
his
ownership
by
virtue
of
being
a
citizen.
so
consequently,
i
would
be
so
bold
as
to
say
that
there
maybe
a
fallacy
in
the
mccready
reading
because
if
that
is
true,
obviously
then,
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
would
apply
even
in
the
mccready
situation.
the
problem
of
course,
with
relying
on
the
mccready
case
is
that
toomer
v.
whitsel
stands
in
the
way
like
a
huge
roadblock.
now,
i
think
it
is
important
to
know
the
factual
situation
which
confronted
the
court
when
that
case
was
decided.
the
shrimp
fishery,
which
was
off
to
southern
coast
was
not
a
shrimp
fishery
that
was
restricted
within
the
territorial
waters
of
any
state,
it
was
a
giant
fish
shrimpery
and
the
shrimp
would
migrate
south
and
the
commercial
shrimp
fishermen
would
start
up
the
northern
part
of
their
shrimp
fishery
and
follow
them
right
down
to
florida.
south
carolina
passed
a
statute
which
restricted
fishing
to
residents
of
south
carolina
within
the
territorial
seas
of
south
carolina.
the
consequence
was,
that
you
had
the
shrimp
fishery
partitioned
along
these
state
lines
and
what
in
effect
you
had
as
i
described
in
our
brief
is
a
feudal
situation.
so,
that
was
the
situation
that
the
court
faced.
the
court
was
well
aware
of
the
mccready
case
of
course,
because
south
carolina
relied
upon
it
exclusively.
and
the
court
characterized
the
mccready
case
as
the
sole
case
using
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
to
justify
discrimination
against
commercial
hunting
and
fishing
by
non
citizens,
absent
persuasive
independent
reasons
to
support
that
discrimination.
it
then
distinguished
mccready
on
the
two
grounds
already
mentioned.
mccready
dealt
with
stationary
fish
in
tidal
waters
and
toomer
dealt
with
migratory
fish
in
the
marginal
sea.
it
characterized
mccready
as
the
sole
exception
to
the
general
rule
and
toomer
is
a
case
that
on
its
facts
did
not
fall
within
that
exception.
and
then
it
said
that
the
very
facts
distinguishing
toomer
made
the
mccready
case
a
very
weak
prop
for
south
carolina
to
rely
upon
because
--
and
then
it
gets
to
the
crucial
point
that
is
very
doubtful
whether
migratory
fish
can
be
owned
citing
the
illustrious
case
of
missouri
v.
holland
where
the
court
said
that
was
the
treaty
case
involving
the
migratory
birds.
“to
put
the
claim
of
the
state
upon
title
is
to
lean
upon
a
slender
reed.
wild
birds
are
not
on
the
possession
of
anyone
and
possession
is
the
beginning
of
ownership”
and
so
consequently,
on
that
basis
and
also
on
the
basis
that
the
state
did
not
own
the
three-mile
belt.
although
the
court
recognized
that
it
could
regulate
within
the
three-mile
belt,
the
court
said
that
the
mccready
case
did
not
apply
and
then
it
came
to
some
other
very
seminal
language,
which
i
should
like
to
quote.
the
court
said
“the
whole
ownership
theory
in
fact
is
now
generally
regarded
as
what
a
fiction
expressive
in
legal
shorthand
of
the
importance
to
its
people
but
the
state
have
power
to
preserve
and
regulate
the
exploitation
of
an
important
resource
and
there
is
no
necessary
conflict
between
that
vital
policy
consideration
and
the
constitutional
command
that
the
state
exercise
that
power,
like
its
other
powers,
so
as
not
to
discriminate
without
reason
against
citizens
of
other
states.”
and
so
consequently...
mr.
vetter
yes
sir,
i
believe
that
would
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
are
a
number
of
state
cases,
which
are
cited
in
our
brief
where
state
courts
have
adopted
that
analysis.
in
a
nutshell,
nowadays,
the
modern
management
tool
is
the
police
power.
the
states
can
do
everything
that
they
need
to
control
their
resources
under
the
police
power
and
the
police
power
is
exercised
consonant
with...
mr.
vetter
yes
sir
it
is,
and
that
is
the
very
point.
mr.
vetter
the
police
power,
your
honor,
gives
us
the
state,
as
we
submit
--
all
the
power
it
needs
to
conserve
its
natural
resources.
however,
the
police
power
is
obviously
subject
to
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
and
our
position
is
that
they
can
only
conserve
their
resources
consummate
with
the
commands
of
those
clauses.
in
other
words,
they
cannot
invidiously
discriminate
against
citizens
of
other
states,
resident
aliens,
or
what
have
you.
mr.
vetter
yes
there
would
be.
i
think
that
that
statute
would
be
unconstitutional
or
put
it
this
way,
i
think
the
court
would
subject
that
statute
to
close
scrutiny.
unless
it
could
be
shown
that
there
is
some
justification
for
the
added
expense.
it
might
be
much
more
expensive
for
example
to
monitor,
to
police
out-state
residents
from
hunting
and
that
point
is
made
clear
in
the
toomer
case.
it
does
not
absolutely
bar
discrimination.
for
example,
the
toomer
case,
the
court
in
the
toomer
case
explicitly
says
“it
is
possible
for
example,
if
south
carolina
could
show
that
is
was
more
expensive
to
watch
over
the
fishing
boats
of
nonresidents
that
they
could
have
a
higher
fee
for
--
mr.
vetter
essentially,
that
is
the
type
of
reasoning
that
i
think
underlies
the
discrimination
which
would
be
allowable
in
this
area.
mr.
vetter
i
would
submit
not,
--
we
would
have
to
do
it
on
a
lottery
basis
or
some
such
basis
where
by
residents
of
rhode
island
in
new
hampshire,
which
are
just
contiguous
states
would
have
--
mr.
vetter
i
would
think
that
they
could,
yes
sir.
i
think
that
is
the
purport
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
mr.
vetter
i
think
the
logic
of
my
position
carries
me
that
far.
but
i
think
the
point
of
the
matter
is
though
is
that,
we
may
be
mixing
apples
and
oranges
again
because
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
or
at
least,
i
think,
it
is
fair
to
say
that
this
is
not
a
conservation
statute.
it
is
a
stature
which
is
really
designed
to
monopolize
that
resource
for
massachusetts’s
residents
and
i
am
not
so
sure
that
they
can
do
that
under
the
constitution.
mr.
vetter
i
am
sure
that
they
can,
yes
sir.
mr.
vetter
it
is
a
much
more
difficult
case.
i
cannot
say
that
the
states,
the
shockwell
(ph)
case,
which
is
cited
in
my
brief,
it
is
a
state
court
case,
out
of
oregon,
out
of
wyoming,
adopted
the
reasoning
that
i
am
adopting
here
that
they
cannot
invidiously
discriminate
and
i
think
that
the
logic
of
my
reasoning
takes
me
to
say
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
discriminate
against
nonresidents
unless
there
was
some
reason
for
the
discrimination.
in
other
words,
they
could
not
merely
say
that
not
merely
say
that
nonresidents
could
not
come
in
or
set
a
prohibitory
license
fee,
merely
on
the
basis
of
non
residency
or
lack
of
state
citizenship.
mr.
vetter
yes
sir,
it
is
my
position.
mr.
vetter
i
use
that
as
an
example
of
the
type
of
discrimination
which
would
be
allowable.
because
it
seems
that
if
you
do
not
have
some
sort
of
independent
reason
such
as
that
as
the
toomer
case
has,
you
are
thrown
automatically
back
on
the
fact
that
the
discrimination
hinging
entirely
on
non-citizenship,
which
i
believe,
not
only
toomer
v.
whitsel
but
any
number
of
other
cases
have
said,
it
is
not
supported
by
the
constitution.
mr.
vetter
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
there
is
a
certain
area
--a
gray
area
that
we
would
like
to
call
it
part
of
the
--
certainly
the
thinking
of
toomer
v.
whitsel
and
missouri
v.
holland
and
magee
v.
gretson,
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
these
other
cases
is
that
that
you
cannot
own
something
which
is
migratory
and,
and
flying
or
swimming
in
the
marginal
sea.
now,
i
think
it
is
possible
that
a
court
could,
if
it
wanted
to
is
draw
a
distinction
because
you
really
do
not
face
the
same
sort
of
overriding
problems
with
bass
in
an
inland
lake
as
you
do
with
commercial
fisheries
in
the
marginal
sea.
i
think
there
would
be
inconsistencies
because
that
would
have
to
be
pitched.
let
me
put
it
this
way,
i
think
that,
if
that
were
pitched
on
a
property
right,
such
as
massachusetts
argues
for
in
this
case,
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
justify
it.
i
think
if
we
pitched
on
the
police
power
or
some
other
power
and
they
were
adequate
grounds
for
the
discrimination
but
i
think
it
would
be
all
right.
mr.
vetter
yes
sir.
mr.
vetter
yes
sir.
i
believe,
i
cited
that
in
my
brief.
the
police
power
was
looked
to
as
the
source
of
the
power.
mr.
vetter
and
upheld,
yes
sir.
mr.
vetter
yes
sir.
mr.
vetter
no
i
don’t,
i
think
the
reason
and
as
i
see
the
reason
for
it
is
simply
this.
that
when
you
put
it
on
a
property
right,
you
have,
bringing
with
it
all
sorts
of
all
learning
through
the
centuries
of
the
common
law.
mr.
vetter
it
is
an
absolutist
point
of
view
and
i
think
the
mccready
case
and
the
argument
of
my
brother
here
is
an
indication
of
where
that
leads
you.
and
that
is
one
of
the
points
that
i
should
like
to
make
here
and
that
is,
that
we
do
not
really
contend
--
obviously
we
do
not
contend
that
the
states
should
not
have
power
to
regulate
its
fishing
gain,
we
do.
mr.
vetter
we
do
concede
that,
but
that
power
has
to
be
exercised
in
an
even
handed
manner
and
the
problem
is
that
when
you
pitch
that
power
on
ownership,
you
end
up
with
the
problems
that
we
have
here
today
because
of
the
type
of
thinking
--
the
absolutist’s
type
of
thinking
that
the
old
land
law
carries
with
it.
mr.
vetter
well,
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
but
they
would
want
to
go
on
to
say
one
other
thing
and
that
is,
that
there
can
be
other
basis
for
the
discrimination
because
in
the
language
of
toomer,
is
that
the
aliens
are
the
peculiar
source
of
the
evil,
that
which
the
statute
has
aimed.
i
imagine
situations
where
there
might
be
a
huge
influx
of
out
of
state
that
is
up
in
vermont
to
deplete
the
resource
and
they
might
then
be
able
to
base
it
on
that.
mr.
vetter
that
is
the
type
of
thinking
which
i
think
would
permit
or
sustain
the
discrimination.
mr.
vetter
yes
sir,
i
would.
mr.
vetter
i
think
it
would
be
the
same
argument.
there
is
one
point
that
i
would
just
like
to
touch
upon,
and
that
is
the
effect
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
our
view
of
that
act
is
that
it
merely
confirmed
in
the
states
whatever
rights
the
states
had
before
and
which
essentially
was
a
management
power
and
at
that
any
event,
if
migratory
fish,
if
wild
animals
cannot
be
owned,
the
federal
government
by
an
act
could
not
say,
or
give
title
to
those
animals.
and
so
consequently,
we
do
not
think
that
the
submerged
lands
act,
has
any
bearing
what
so
ever
on
toomer
v.
whitsel
and
so
that
the
language
in
the
submerged
lands
act,
referring
to
ownership
of
fish
is
really
again
the
language
of
toomer
v.
whitsel
but
it
is
a
legal
shorthand
for
the
power
to
manage.
mr.
vetter
yes
sir
it
did.
mr.
vetter
this
court
in
and
mann
case,
a
recent
decision
cited
in
my
brief,
points
out
that
the
submerged
lands
act
did
not
over
rule
the
california
case.
mr.
vetter
it
did
turn
it
around,
yes
sir.
mr.
vetter
at
the
very
most,
it
would
cut
out
that
one
segment
of
toomer,
the
three-mile
belt
ownership
but
it
would
not
cut
out
the
other
argument
that
you
can
own
wild
birds
and
fish.
and
one
further
point
and
that
in
of
the
addendum
to
our
brief,
we
cite
certain
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
congress
was
well
aware
of
toomer
v.
whitsel
when
it
passed
the
submerged
lands
act
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
an
amendment,
which
would
be
the
gist
of
the
argument
that
we
are
making
now
was
entirely
superfluous
in
lieu
of
that
act.
mr.
vetter
i
cited
in
my
brief
and
it
seems
to
me
what
was
meant
by
that
of,
by
that
footnote
was
very
simply
that
very
early
in
the
game,
there
was
a
confusion
made.
the
gist
of
the
footnote
is
that,
way
back
in
the
old
days,
roman
days
perhaps,
control
of
wild
game
was
based
on
imperium,
which
was
state
power
than
dominium,
which
is
ownership.
and
to
that
extent,
i
would
certainly
say
that
we
do
rely
on
it
because
of
this
imperium,
i
think
it
goes
into
the
police
power
and
not
into
the
ownership
concept
and
that
is
really
what
i
have
been
arguing
this
morning
or
this
afternoon.
mr.
vetter
finally
on
policy
grounds,
to
reinstate
mccready
we
submit
would
reinstate
the
feudal
situation
that
we
have
in
the
marginal
sea
of
the
head
and
the
marginal
sea
in
that
case.
migratory
fish
do
not
know
any
boundaries,
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
commercial
fishermen
to
carry
on
your
calling.
if
all
of
a
sudden
they
had
to
stop
them,
turn
away
when
they
are
dragging
for
fish
because
they
are
reaching
a
boundary.
states
with
small
boundaries
like
new
hampshire,
for
example,
up
where
i
live
would
have
a
very
limited
area
in
which
to
fish,
because
they
just
obviously
would
not
own
as
much
of
the
marginal
sea.
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
would
also
be
a
step
backwards
because
it
would
lead
to
such
situations
as
we
had
in
the
kleppe
case,
which
i
talked
about
earlier.
and
quite
frankly,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
doctrine
that
massachusetts
would
argue
for
could
really
lead
to
the
depletion
of
natural
resources
because
what
is
really
to
say
that
a
state
is
necessarily
going
to
conserve
its
resources.
and
certainly
as
we
see
a
lot
of
our
problems
in
the
marginal
sea
and
out
of
the
200
mile
limit
right
now,
we
are
beginning
to
realize
that
there
has
to
be
a
broader
control.
if
within
the
three
mile
limit
the
states
had
this
exclusive
powers,
we
really
cannot
say
what
might
happen
and
so,
in
conclusion
we
submit
that
the
court
should
affirm
the
decision
of
the
supreme
judicial
court.
