justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cutrer,
when
was
that
offer
to
rescind
made?
justice
john
paul
stevens
judge
peck,
it's
my
understanding
that
your
brothers
on
the
other
side
of
the
podium
claim
that
you
were
acting
here
or
you
may
have
been
acting
as
a
conventional
statutory
underwriter
in
the
terms
of
the
1993
act
in
your
capacity
in
connection
with
the
registration
statement;
that
in
addition,
you
had
a
different
hat
on
through
a
good
deal
of
these
negotiations;
and
that
you
were
the
general
or
the
manager
or
whatever
the
language
is
in
their
brief
--
i've
forgotten
--
of
the
whole
deal,
and
in
that
respect
you
were
not
a,
quote,
"underwriter",
but
you
were
acting
in
quite
a
different
capacity.
do
i
understand
that
correctly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
not
saying
solely
as
an
underwriter.
that,
i
thought,
was
their
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
liman,
could
i
interrupt
you
there?
the
court
of
appeals
when
it
affirmed
the
denial
of
the
preliminary
injunction
didn't
rely
on
that
as
i
read
it,
but
rather
relied
on
the
fact
that
you
could
have
received
a
permanent
order
of
divestiture,
at
least
as
to
the
10(b)-6
violation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
thereafter,
as
i
understand
the
case,
you
waived
any
equitable
remedies
and
elected
to
stand
on
damages.
wouldn't
this
have
not
been
an
appropriate
case
for
going
forward
on
an
equitable
basis
after
that
point
and,
if
not,
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
microphone,
please?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cutrer,
could
i
ask
you
two
questions
that
you
covered
in
your
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
number
one,
would
you
agree
or
disagree
that
the
management
would
have
standing
under
14(e)
that's
one
question,
and
the
other
question,
i
want
you
to
refresh
my
recollection.
why
is
the
scienter
relevant
to
our
problems
here
in
view
of
the
fact
that
liability
is
a
given?
that
covers
your
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
the
first
question
is
whether
management
of
the
other
contestant
would
have
standing
under
14(e),
and
logically
i'm
...
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
in
your
counterclaim
in
the
district
court,
was
that
the
same
position
you
took
there?
was
it
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
wasn't
yours;
rather,
the
piper
individuals
took
the
position,
i
guess,
that
they
had
standing,
didn't
they?
was
there
not
a
counterclaim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
if
you
should
admit
that
management
would
have
standing
in
a
contest
like
this,
doesn't
that
make
it
sort
of
a
one-sided
standing
rule,
that
one
side
has
standing,
but
the
other
does
not?
that's
what
troubles
me
a
little
bit
about
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
sue
for
the
corporation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
i
understand
that.
