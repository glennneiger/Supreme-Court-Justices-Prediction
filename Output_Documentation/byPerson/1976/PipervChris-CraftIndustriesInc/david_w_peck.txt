mr.
david
w.
peck
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
threshold
question
in
this
case
as
far
as
first
boston
is
concerned
is
what
duty
it
owed
to
whom
in
its
capacity
as
underwriter
of
bangor
punta’s
registration
statement
and
exchange
offer,
and
specifically
did
it
owe
any
duty
to
chris-craft
as
a
competing
offeror.
the
answer
is
found
in
section
11
of
the
securities
act,
defining
the
responsibility
of
an
underwriter
on
a
registration
statement,
which
is
a
duty
of
due
diligence
created
by
section
11
and
owed
only
to
persons
acquiring
the
securities
offered.
now,
chris-craft
was
not
a
member
of
that
class,
and
there's
no
suggestion
that
it
had
any
standing
under
section
11.
the
claim
is,
but
not
withstanding
the
express
provisions
and
limitations
of
section
11,
first
boston
had
an
implied
responsibility
under
section
14(e)
of
the
securities
exchange
act,
an
act
that
makes
no
reference
to
underwriters
and
unlimited
as
to
the
persons
to
whom
it
might
be
liable
and
as
to
the
amount
that
might
be
recovered,
because
the
registration
statement
was
made
in
connection
with
a
tender
offer.
that
fact,
that
connection,
makes
all
the
difference.
now,
the
untenability
of
such
a
claim,
we
submit,
is
apparent,
both
from
its
conflict
with
the
express
language
of
section
11
and
in
necessary
recognition
of
the
fact
that
section
11
is
the
source
and
the
only
source
of
an
underwriter’s
responsibility
on
a
registration
statement.
mr.
david
w.
peck
yes,
that
is
their
contention,
but
has
been
completely
rejected
expressly
and
specifically
by
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
whose
only
fault
was
found
as
far
as
first
boston
is
concerned
with
respect
to
14(e)
and
it
said
that
it
had
no
directing
or
responsible
connection
with
any
of
the
other
alleged
violations;
that
it
acted
only
in
a
professional
capacity
and
solely
in
good
faith.
those
were
the
findings
of
both
the
district
court
and
the
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
well,
cover
it
as
you
will
there,
in
the
first
place
the
courts
below
said
that
it
did
not
participate
in
these
other
matters
in
any
respect
other
than
lending
professional
advice
and
assistance.
now,
i
submit
that
that
doesn't
make
anyone
a
principal
or
impose
any
of
the
liabilities
of
a
principal.
mr.
david
w.
peck
well,
first
boston
came
in
in
its
first
connection
after
the
pipers
rejected
…
well,
the
pipers
in
the
first
place
asked
bangor
punta
to
appraise
the
value
of
the
chris-craft
offer
in
the
first
place,
which
they
did
and
which
they
said
had
a
value
of
$65
a
share.
the
next
thing
was
after
the
pipers
decided
that
they
didn't
want
chris-craft
as
a
partner,
they
asked
first
boston
to
participate
in
finding
another
offeror,
which
it
did;
then
bangor
punta
came
in.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
section
14(e)
to
imply
this
cause
of
action
that's
been
asserted
here.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
suggest
any
such
congressional
intent.
indeed,
the
whole
of
the
legislative
history
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
intent
was
to
protect
only
investors,
the
class
to
whom
an
offer
is
addressed,
the
only
persons
who
can
act
upon
the
offer
and
the
only
persons
who
can
be
mislead
if
there's
anything
misleading.
there
is
nothing
to
meet
any
of
the
tests
that
this
court
has
enumerated
in
the
past
for
implied
causes
of
action.
indeed,
the
very
idea
of
causes
of
action
to
a
person
outside
a
protected
class
upon
a
showing
that
the
class
was
misled
certainly
does
not
give
rise
to
the
implication
of
a
cause
of
action.
now,
the
anomaly
is
illustrated
here.
not
one
of
the
persons
who
accepted
the
bangor
offer
has
ever
complained.
not
one
accepted
the
offer
of
rescission
by
direction
of
the
district
court.
and
the
anomaly
is
further
illustrated
by
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
here
about
causation.
chris-craft
deduced
no
evidence
that
the
so-called
admission
of
the
bar
--
in
that,
i
refer
to
bar
as
the
railroad
and
the
sale
of
the
railroad
--
that
the
omission
of
that
from
the
bangor
punta
registration
statement
accounted
either
for
bangor
punta’s
success
in
the
contest
or
for
chris-craft’s
loss
of
the
contest.
and
the
district
courts
therefore
held,
and
i'm
going
to
quote,
that
"chris-craft
had
failed
to
establish
an
essential
element
of
an
action
for
damages,
to
wit,
a
causal
relation
between
the
deficiency
in
the
bangor
punta
prospectus
and
the
harm
complained
of".
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
faced
with
the
inability
to
establish
causation,
solved
the
problem
very
simply.
it
said
that
proof
of
causation,
injury
and
damage
was
unnecessary.
all
were
to
be
presumed.
now,
the
presumption
that
the
court
had
to
indulge
in
to
reach
its
decision
is
not
only
impermissible
as
a
matter
of
law
and
demonstrative
of
the
lack
of
proof
of
causation
in
this
case,
but
i
submit
also
demonstrative
of
why
such
a
cause
of
action
as
chris-craft
is
asserting
here
does
not
exist
under
the
law.
common
and
statutory
law
down
the
years,
even
in
this
era
of
consumer
litigation,
have
been
both
practical
and
sensible
in
not
spawning
endless
litigation
between
competitors
on
charges
that
misleading
advertising
of
one
has
taken
away
customers
from
the
other,
and
congress
certainly
didn't
intend
to
launch
such
litigation
by
14(e).
now,
the
court
of
appeals
must
have
understood
all
this,
for
it
offered
a
special
theory
of
imposing
a
non-existing
liability
upon
bangor
punta
and
first
boston
alike.
it
is,
as
the
court
expressed
it,
that
14(e)
created,
quote,
“a
broader
standing
to
sue
accorded
to
offerors
based
on
fraudulent
transactions”
--
in
other
words,
scienter
creates
standard
--
and
then
it
proceeded
to
say
what
it
meant
by
scienter,
and
it
was
that
it
meant
something
more
than
mere
negligence.
mr.
david
w.
peck
standing.
mr.
david
w.
peck
standing,
yes,
your
honor.
and
then
it
made
its
great
error
conclusive
in
the
light
of
this
court’s
language
in
hochfelder.
it
said
that
an
intent
to
deceive
is
not
an
essential
element
of
the
cause
of
action.
in
other
words,
even
though
you're
in
a
fraud
case,
you
don't
need
intent
to
defraud.
anything
more
than
mere
negligence
as
it
labeled
first
boston’s
conduct
here
would
be
sufficient.
i'm
going
to
come,
therefore,
to
scienter
as
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
worked
it
out.
it
said
that
bangor
punta
was
required
to
apprise
the
piper
shareholders
of
the
negotiation
over
the
bar
and
of
the
consequent
indication
that
it
wasn't
worth
what
it
was
carried
at
on
the
books;
and
that
first
boston
had
enough
information
to
reasonably
deduce
that
the
registration
statement
was
inaccurate
in
this
respect.
the
particulars
given,
however,
were
entirely
in
the
terms
of
first
boston’s
investigation,
which
it
said
wasn't
sufficient;
that
it
should
have
undertaken
a
further
investigation.
now,
there's
no
suggestion
in
the
opinion
as
to
what
any
further
investigation
of
the
first
boston
would
have
disclosed
or
that
it
would
have
disclosed
anything
other
than
what
first
boston,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
alike
found,
that
there
had
been
no
decision
to
sell
the
railroad
at
the
time
the
registration
statement
was
out.
indeed,
the
district
court
rejected
as
having
no
substance
chris-craft’s
basic
claim
that
at
the
time
of
bangor
punta’s
exchange
offer,
it
had
intended
to
sell
the
bar
and
delayed
the
sale
to
avoid
disclosure,
and
said
that
it
could
not
even
find
that
there
was
any
probability,
reasonable
probability
of
a
sale
at
that
time;
that
there
was
no
purpose
for
omission
of
it
from
the
prospectus;
and
that
first
boston
acted
solely
in
good
faith.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
those
findings
and
agreed
that
the
failure
to
disclose
the
sale
negotiations
was
not
in
bad
faith
and
then
adding,
however,
these
faithful
words,
"that
intent
to
defraud
is
not
an
indispensable
element
in
the
private
action
for
damages
under
the
anti-fraud
provisions
of
the
federal
securities
law".
that
is
the
key
sentence
and
the
critical
one
as
far
as
scienter
is
concerned
in
this
case,
and
by
this
court’s
definition
of
it
in
hochfelder,
the
court
of
appeals
was
clearly
in
error.
of
course,
it
didn't
have
the
benefit
of
this
court’s
decision
at
that
time.
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
certainly
think
there's
nothing
to
remand.
assuming
standing,
any
claim
under
14(e)
would
have
to
establish
an
intent
to
deceive
or
defraud.
not
only
that
hasn't
even
been
attempted
here,
i
would
say,
but
it's
certainly
the
findings
of
both
courts
are
against
it;
so
there
has
already
been
a
determination.
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
have
the
case
...
mr.
david
w.
peck
yes,
you
granted
certiorari
…
mr.
david
w.
peck
…
that's
right,
very
shortly
afterwards.
all
right.
thank
you,
your
honors.
