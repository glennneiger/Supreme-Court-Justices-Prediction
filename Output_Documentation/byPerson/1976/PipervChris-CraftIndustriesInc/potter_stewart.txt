justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask,
mr.
cutrer,
am
i
correct
in
my
understanding
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
either
or
both
of
these
constituted
a
violation
is
not
an
issue
here
before
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
so
we
will
see
here
on
the
premise
that
they
both
did
constitute
violations.
justice
potter
stewart
okay.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
cutrer,
it
is
pretty
well
settled,
isn't
it,
in
the
federal
courts
generally
that
a
competing
offeror
in
a
proposed
effort
for
takeover
situation
can
go
into
federal
district
court
and
get
an
injunction?
justice
potter
stewart
an
injunction
against
a
competing
offeror.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
were
two
violations.
they
could
hardly
have
occurred
in
every
stage.
there
were
two,
one
involving
the
bangor
&
aroostock
railroad
valuation
and
the
other
a
violation
of
10(b)-6,
was
that
it?
two
violations.
