mr.
arthur
l.
liman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you,
as
my
brother
said,
a
colorful
tale
or
talk
flavor;
but
i
think
it
would
be
of
assistance
to
this
court
if
i
talk
facts,
the
undisputed
facts
on
which
the
court
of
appeals'
decisions
rested.
and
i
think
that
you'll
find
that
those
facts
bear
little
recognition
to
the
presentations
that
have
been
made
before.
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
observed,
the
issue
of
violation
was
not
raised
in
the
petitions,
and
those
are
given
and
they
were
serious
violations.
and
they
occurred
at
every
stage
of
this
control
contest.
at
every
single
state
of
this
control
contest,
there
were
violations
committed
by
the
petitionist
to
thwart
chris-craft,
violations
which
brought
forth
two
sec
lawsuits
and
one
proceeding
by
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
no,
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
was
a
violation
in
january
at
the
time
chris-craft
made
its
tender
offer,
when
the
piper
family
to
discourage
shareholders
from
accepting
that
offer
made
misrepresentations
to
them.
there
were
violations
when
bangor
punta
acquired
its
shares
illegally
in
violation
of
rule
10(b)-6.
there
were
violations
when
it
announced
its
exchange
offer,
and
there
were
violations
when
chris-craft’s
exchange
offer
was
competing
head-to-head
against
bangor
punta’s
exchange
offer.
but
i
really
would
like
to
concentrate
on
the
two
violations
which
your
honor
is
referring
to,
because
it
is
also
a
given
in
this
case
that
the
control
that
bangor
punta
has
and
exercises
rests
on
14½
percent
of
piper
stock
which
it
acquired
illegally,
illegally
in
these
two
transactions,
one
the
acquisition
of
7½
percent
for
cash,
the
other
7
percent
through
a
misleading
exchange
offer,
and
that
without
those
blocks
not
only
would
bangor
punta
not
have
control
of
piper,
but
at
the
end
of
the
exchange
offers,
chris-craft
would
have
been
leading
by
41
to
31
percent,
and
that
was
a
lead
which
all
experts,
including
their
own,
testified
was
virtually
insurmountable.
and
finally,
there
is
another
point
that
i
should
address
myself
to
right
at
the
outset,
and
that
is
that
chris-craft
didn't
come
into
court
for
the
first
time
asking
for
damages;
it
came
into
court
asking
for
what
my
brother
cutler
said
a
tenderer
should
ask
for.
it
asked
for
a
preliminary
injunction
in
late
july
of
1969
to
preclude,
to
enjoin
bangor
from
having
the
right
to
vote
the
illegally
acquired
cash
shares
and
from
consummating
its
exchange
offer.
it
told
the
court
at
that
time
that
if
bangor
punta
was
allowed
to
consummate
the
exchange
offer,
the
contest
would
be
over.
and
bangor
punta
at
that
time
opposed
it.
and
it
said,
and
i
quote
from
its
memorandum
in
opposition
to
that
preliminary
injunction
that
it
should
be
denied,
because
even
assuming
chris-craft
can
prove
the
allegations
in
its
moving
papers
at
a
full
trial
after
bangor
punta
has
had
the
opportunity
of
properly
preparing
itself
for
trial,
a
money
judgment
will
fully
compensate
chris-craft
for
any
damages.
so
when
--
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
yes.
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
yes,
mr.
justice
stevens;
but
we
did
not
abandon
the
request
for
divestiture
immediately.
what
happened
was
that
after
the
court
of
appeals
found
the
violations
in
chris-craft
i
and
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
relief,
bangor
punta
with
full
knowledge
of
this
proceeded
to
change
the
complexion
of
piper,
brought
in
a
new
chief
executive
officer
and
took
other
steps
which
the
court
of
appeals
in
chris-craft
ii
recognized
made
divestiture
unfeasible.
but
even
in
chris-craft
ii,
we
said,
"here
we
first
asked
for
preliminary
relief,
they
say
get
damages.
now
in
chris-craft
ii,
they
say
damages
are
unavailable.
so
if
damages
are
unavailable,
give
us
divestiture",
and
they
opposed
divestiture
there.
they
have
opposed
all
forms
of
relief.
they
want
to
enjoy
the
benefits
of
an
illegally
gained
control.
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
no,
they
opposed
it
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
appropriate
relief,
that
chris-craft
had
waived
it;
and
they
also,
of
course,
opposed
liability,
but
they
opposed
divestiture
as
relief.
and
the
court
of
appeals
if
you'll
note
in
chris-craft
ii
said
it
really
was
unfeasible,
and
i
could
explain
the
difficulties
with
it;
but
they
threw
up
every
obstacle
to
equitable
relief,
which
is
what
we
were
really
seeking.
we
were
not
seeking,
as
they
suggest
in
their
brief,
a
bailout.
piper
was
and
still
is
a
most
valuable
company.
your
honor
--
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
no.
after
chris-craft
i
was
decided
and
after
they
proceeded
to
make
the
changes
in
management,
we
said
to
the
district
court,
"we
don't
believe
that
divestiture
is
practical
now,
we
want
damages".
when
they
then
opposed
damages,
we
said,
"well,
if
damages
are
not
available,
then
we
will
take
divestiture,
because
an
inadequate
relief
is
better
than
no
relief".
they
opposed
divestiture,
and
when
it
was
remanded
finally
in
chris-craft
ii,
the
court
of
appeals
said
divestiture
is
impractical
and
unfeasible
to
award
damages.
now,
in
the
early
stages
of
the
contest
--
and
i
don't
want
to
dwell
on
them;
that
was
the
period
before
bangor
came
in,
and
it
was
a
period
when
piper
committed
these
violations
--
and
they
tell
you
that
piper
acted
in
order
to
oppose
chris-craft.
we
haven't
disputed
their
right
to
oppose
chris-craft.
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
the
piper
individuals,
we
never
disputed
that.
that
is
a
false
issue
here;
but
they
had
to
oppose
it
by
lawful
means,
and
the
president
of
bangor
punta,
wallace,
testified
at
trial
that
when
he
met
them
to
come
into
the
race,
they
were
espousing
a
scorched-earth
policy
against
chris-craft.
those
were
his
words.
now,
bangor
punta
entered
in
may.
it
entered
by
acquiring
the
piper
shares,
and
it
announced
an
exchange
offer
--
chris-craft
also
had
a
pending
exchange
offer
in
registration
--
and
at
that
time
the
contest
stood
at
33%
chris-craft,
31%
bangor
punta;
so
it
was
nip-and-tuck.
and
bangor
punta
recognized
and
the
record
shows
it
that
the
outcome
would
turn
on
certain
blocks
of
stock
that
were
held
by
large
holders,
principally
the
fund
of
funds,
the
cornfeld
organization.
and
bangor
punta
was
advised
that
these
shares
were
leaning
toward
chris-craft,
they
were
emotionally
committed
to
chris-craft
and
that
unless
bangor
punta
could
take
these
shares
out
from
under
--
and
i'm
quoting
--
"out
from
under"
chris-craft,
that
chris-craft
would
win
and
that
bangor
punta’s
strategy
memoranda
show
that
only
by
acquiring
these
shares
could
it
win.
now,
there
was
one
obstacle
to
the
acquisition
of
these
shares,
and
that
was
rule
10(b)-6
of
the
sec,
which
as
it
read
and
as
it
was
interpreted
by
the
sec
precluded
a
company
that
had
announced
an
exchange
offer
from
buying
the
stock
of
the
target
company
for
cash.
now,
this
was
a
matter
of
real
concern
to
the
sec,
because
in
april
it
called
chris-craft
and
its
counsel
kravet
down
to
the
sec,
and
it
warned
chris-craft
that
if
it
bought
any
of
these
shares
for
cash,
it
would
consider
it
a
willful
violation
subject
to
criminal
penalties.
and
the
counsel
for
chris-craft
advised
chris-craft
to
comply;
chris-craft
did
comply.
it
cancelled
all
orders
to
buy
shares
for
cash,
and
it
didn't
buy
another
share
for
cash
while
its
exchange
offer
was
pending,
even
though
the
opportunities
were
presented.
now,
on
the
eve
of
bangor
punta
entering
the
contest,
the
sec
published
this
warning
in
a
release.
bangor
punta
stipulated
in
chris-craft
ii
that
it
read
the
release;
and
it
not
only
read
the
release,
but
it
received
a
warning
from
its
counsel
to
comply.
bangor
punta
said
it
relied
on
counsel.
well,
no
court
here,
district
court
or
court
of
appeals,
has
found
that
any
of
these
parties
relied
on
counsel
in
either
the
10(b)-6
violations
or
the
exchange
offer.
but
its
counsel
testified,
and
it's
what
he
says
and
not
what's
said
in
a
brief
in
this
court,
and
he
said
that
while
he
differed
with
the
sec's
interpretations
--
and
i'm
quoting,
and
it's
in
our
brief
on
page
13
to
14
--
“we
felt
that
under
the
circumstances
we
should
take
a
conservative
position,
and
therefore
what
we
instructed
management
in
effect
was,
or
in
substance,
that
in
view
of
that
language,
we
should
not
involve
ourselves
in
the
solicitation
of
any
shares.
in
other
words,
we
thought
that
it
was
proper
to
buy
shares
of
stock,
but
only
if
they
were
unsolicited
and
not
over
an
exchange.”
and
he
later
went
on
to
testify
in
accordance
with
the
wording
of
that
rule
he
instructed
his
management
--
"instructed",
these
are
the
words
--
not
to
buy
shares
from
broker
dealers.
really,
what
happened
here
could
be
summed
up
in
the
difference
between
the
way
bangor
punta
reacted
to
the
advice
of
counsel
and
the
way
chris-craft
did,
because
bangor
punta
went
right
out
after
these
instructions
and
it
bought
first
40,000
shares
of
stock
from
2
broker
dealers,
american
securities
and
base
securities.
it
stipulated
in
chris-craft
ii
that
it
doesn't
even
claim
an
exemption
on
those
purchases
under
rule
10(b)-6,
and
in
fact
its
counsel
testified
that
they
didn't
tell
them
about
those
purchases
until
after
they
were
made;
so
much
for
the
reliance
on
counsel.
more
importantly,
they
went
and
bought
80,000
shares
from
fund
of
funds,
and
there
they
presented
an
issue
of
fact,
an
excuse
at
trial
in
chris-craft
ii.
they
said
that
these
shares
were
not
solicited,
and
the
district
court
found
against
them
and
it
said
they
solicited
them;
they
actually
flew
off
to
the
bahamas
to
pick
them
up,
and
bangor
punta
never
even
appealed
from
the
finding
of
the
district
court
that
those
shares
were
solicited.
so
that,
in
effect,
all
120,000
shares
were
bought
in
violation
of
their
counsel’s
advice
and
in
violation
of
rule
10(b)-6,
and
it
isn't
as
if
bangor
didn't
have
a
remedy
if
it
wanted
to
contest
the
sec’s
interpretation,
the
sec’s
signals
and
instructions
and
directions
here,
because
rule
10(b)-6
contains
an
exemption
provision,
which
says
that
if
you
feel
that
any
particular
purchase
may
not
have
a
manipulative
or
a
proper
effect,
then
you
go
to
the
sec
and
present
your
case.
well,
if
they
had
done
that
and
if
the
sec
had
agreed
with
them,
then
the
sec
would
have
had
to
give
chris-craft
notice
that
it,
too,
could
compete
for
and
buy
these
shares.
so,
what
did
bangor
punta
do?
it
just
simply
defied
its
counsel’s
advice
and
went
behind
the
back
of
the
sec
and
bought
these
shares
while
chris-craft
was
sitting
there
like
a
bunch
of
boy
scouts.
now,
to
add
--
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
no
personal
…
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
yes,
they
issued
a
release
on
may
5
…
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
…
which
bangor
punta
stipulated
that
it
read
before
it
made
any
of
these
purchases
and
which
its
counsel
used
to
instruct
them
not
to
do
it.
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
your
honor,
i
don't
know
of
any
other
public
ones.
it
was
a
matter
that
was
bruited
about
at
the
bar,
and
it
was
of
a
sufficient
concern
to
the
sec
that
they
called
chris-craft
down
there
and
threatened
them
with
a
willful
violation
if
they
bought.
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
after
it
had
made
them.
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
well,
what
was
going
behind
the
back,
mr.
justice
powell,
was
that
they
did
not
go
for
an
exemption,
which
is
what
the
orderly
procedure
was
prescribed
by
rule
10(b)-6.
had
they
done
that,
then
chris-craft
would
have
been
in
the
same
position
as
bangor
punta
if
the
sec
agreed.
what
was
going
behind
the
back
was
in
bypassing
the
exemption
procedure
that
was
established
by
the
sec,
and
nobody
here
challenges
the
sec’s
right
to
have
promulgated
this
rule
or
to
have
interpreted
it
the
way
it
did.
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
well,
i
think
that
on
the
issue
of
intent,
you
have
a
knowing
violation
here
in
the
sense
that
they
knew
of
the
sec’s
direction,
they
were
instructed
by
their
counsel
not
to
buy,
and
they
went
out
and
bought.
and
i
don't
know
a
case
in
which
the
facts
quite
frame
it
so
strongly
as
that.
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
no,
your
honor.
i
have
read
from
the
record
the
only
sections
that
deal
with
this,
in
which
his
instructions
were
quite
clear,
don't
solicit,
and
he
went
on
to
say
don't
--
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
this
was
their
house
counsel,
and
this
was
their
house
counsel
after
talking
with
their
outside
counsel.
and
there
is
no
court,
as
i
say,
that
has
ever
found
that
they
relied
on
counsel.
now,
they
add,
really,
insult
to
the
injury
here
by
saying
that
all
that
they
did
was
run
a
red
light
at
an
empty
intersection.
well,
chris-craft
was
at
that
intersection,
and
it
had
paid
some
$44
million
to
be
there,
and
what
had
really
happened,
as
i
said
before,
is
that
while
chris-craft
was
stopped
at
that
red
light
because
of
the
sec,
they
went
barreling
through.
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
so
let
me
turn,
then,
and
i'd
like
to
then
return
to
the
bangor
&
aroostock
railroad
spats,
to
the
whole
issue
of
standing,
first
under
14(e)
and
then
under
10(b)-6.
on
section
14(e),
the
argument
here,
the
premise
of
their
argument,
is
that
the
williams
act
was
passed
to
protect
only
stockholders
and
not
to
establish
rules
of
the
game,
which
would
be
for
the
protection
of
the
contestants.
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
that
even
if
their
premise
were
correct
--
and
i'll
show
you
that
it
is
not
--
that
the
only
way
that
that
protection
of
shareholders
could
be
enforced
is
by
permitting
the
contestants
to
have
a
right
of
action,
which
is
the
conclusion
that
the
various
courts
that
have
considered
this
have
come
to.
and
the
reason
is
simple:
congress
recognized
that
these
tender
offers
always
made
at
a
premium
above
market
were
of
great
benefit,
great
value,
to
shareholders.
now,
who
would
make
a
tender
offer,
who
would
seek
control,
if
he
could
be
cheated
out
of
it
by
illegal
means?
and
you
were
told
here,
at
least
congress
was
told,
by
the
sec
that
the
sec
did
not
have
the
means
to
police
these
controlled
contests
made
by
tender
offers.
the
sec
said
the
time
was
too
short,
their
resources
were
too
small,
there
wasn't
pre-filing.
senator
williams
himself
expressed
skepticism
and
pessimism,
which
i
share,
about
the
utility
of
shareholder
actions
in
keeping
these
contests
honest;
and
therefore
if
these
rules
which
congress
wanted
to
lay
down
to
end
industrial
warfare
were
to
have
any
teeth
and
to
have
any
meaning,
then
the
parties
who
have
the
stake
in
the
contest,
the
contestants,
really
have
to
have
the
power
to
police
each
other.
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
congress,
it
was
not;
but
it
was
told
what
i
had
said
before,
that
the
sec
didn't
have
the
manpower
and
resources
to
do
it.
now,
what
was
in
congress’s
mind,
because
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
that?
in
the
blue
chip
case,
the
court
observed
that
the
cause
of
action
under
10(b)-5
was
really
implied
in
the
absence
of
any
indication
by
the
sec
or
congress
that
there
would
be
a
private
right
of
action.
well,
here
there
was
a
vast
difference.
first,
it
was
clear
from
what
was
said
by
both
the
sec
and
by
senator
williams
that
a
principal
purpose
of
this
act
was
to
establish
ground
rules,
a
code
of
fair
play,
which
would
protect
both
sides
to
the
contest,
and
on
the
very
pages
that
they
cite
for
the
proposition
that
congress
was
concerned
only
about
shareholders.
in
the
senate
hearings,
mr.
cohen
said,
"i
should
indicate,
however,
that
the
shareholders
alone
are
not
the
only
persons
concerned"
and
noted
that
if
the
bill
were
passed
it
might
serve
to
help
the
takeover
bidder
in
certain
situations.
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
well,
i
think
so,
because
the
sec
proposed
section
14(e)
here;
it
wasn't
in
the
original
bill.
but
now
let
me
quote
senator
williams,
the
chairman
of
the
committee.
he
said,
“it
is
our
nation’s
legitimate
businessmen,
as
well
as
the
more
than
20
million
american
shareholders,
who
have
the
most
to
gain
from
this
legislation.”
again
--
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
i
cite
that
remark
and
others,
such
as
the
desire
to
avoid
tipping
the
balance,
the
importance
in
other
parts
of
the
legislative
history
that
the
statement
in
the
house
hearings
that
if
there
were
an
orderly,
supervised
process
of
disclosure
and
if
some
ground
rules
were
laid
down,
not
only
would
the
investors
be
better
protected,
but
everyone
would
know
where
he
stands.
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
that
was
mr.
cohen,
the
chairman
of
the
sec,
telling
congress
that.
i
cite
that
for
the
proposition
that
congress
was
not
concerned
alone
and
was
not
insensitive
to
the
fact
that
by
establishing
rules
of
a
contest
that
you
would
be
offering
protection
for
both
sides,
just
as
you
have
in
any
contest.
more
than
that,
this
was
a
case
in
which
the
act
was
passed
after
a
long
history
in
the
courts
of
causes
of
action
under
borak
under
section
10(b)-5,
and
borak
was
discussed
before
congress.
senator
williams
was
sophisticated;
he
knew
about
it.
and
the
sec
in
a
letter
to
the
house
pointed
out
that
the
birnbaum
rule
was
an
obstacle
to
lawsuits
against
management
opposing
tender
offers
and
said
that
because
the
new
language
of
the
williams
act
was
rejecting
the
in-connection-with-sale
language,
then
that
obstacle
would
be
removed.
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
to
i
think
it
was
congressman
staggers.
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
i
think
it
qualifies
as
legislative
history
in
determining
whether
there
should
be
an
implied
cause
of
action,
because
congress
acted
on
it.
section
14(e)
--
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
i
know,
because
section
14(e),
unlike
section
10(b)-5,
does
not
contain
the
birnbaum
blue
chip
language
about
in
connection
with
the
sale.
it
contains
language
of
a
much
broader
nature,
and
it
contains
that
language
after
congress
was
told
that
the
effect
of
the
language
would
be
to
eliminate
the
birnbaum
obstacle.
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
no,
it
could
mean
that;
and
it
could
go
beyond
that
and
say
that
anybody
who's
in
the
target
area
has
a
right
to
sue,
because
the
cases
that
were
coming
up
in
the
courts
at
that
time
involved
the
protagonists
to
these
contests.
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
he
used
that
on
the
same
page,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
where
he
said
that
the
investor
is
not
the
only
party
who's
concerned.
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
yes,
but
he
said
that
the
way
of
making
sure
that
the
investor
was
not
going
to
be
lost
in
the
shuffle
was
by
establishing
rules
of
fair
play,
which
would
be
binding
on
both
sides
and
which
would
constitute
codes
of
conduct
on
which
they
could
rely.
and
page
for
page,
i
think
the
court
will
find
in
the
legislative
history,
there
was
more
concern
expressed
about
conduct
by
management
than
conduct
by
the
tenderer.
now,
the
commentators
at
the
time
--
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
oh,
i
don't
think
that
it's
inconsistent.
i
think,
as
in
the
proxy
contest,
that
the
only
way
the
investor
can
get
protected
is
if
the
parties
to
the
contest
can
police
each
other's
conduct.
now,
when
congress
had
the
bill
before
it
with
this
broad
language
removing
birnbaum,
there
were
commentaries,
including
in
the
business
lawyer,
all
of
which
construed
the
fact
that
this
bill
was
being
enacted
with
this
legislative
history
would
confer
standing.
the
sec,
the
principal
draftsman
--
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
on
the
tenderer,
as
well
as
the
target.
the
sec,
which
was
the
principal
draftsman
and,
as
such,
this
court
has
usually
said
its
views
are
entitled
in
those
circumstances
to
great
weight,
went
right
into
court
within
a
matter
of
months
after
the
passage
of
this
act
and
said
it
confers
standing
on
both
sides.
and
most
important,
congress
in
1970
amended
this
act.
it
amended
the
act
after
there
had
been
four
celebrated
cases,
which
said
that
there
was
standing
for
both
tenderer
and
for
management
--
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
four
cases.
one
of
them,
crane,
was
a
money-damage
case,
your
honor,
and
the
congress
did
nothing
to
circumscribe
these
interpretations;
it
did
nothing
to
diminish
this
right
of
action.
in
fact,
acting
at
the
sec’s
request,
it
strengthened
the
act
by
giving
the
sec
more
rulemaking
power.
now,
crane
was
decided
on
pre-williams
act's
grounds,
giving
the
tenderer
standing;
but
the
court
said
squarely
that
this
issue
will
no
longer
be
with
us,
because
section
14(e)
gives
the
standing
now.
now,
the
concessions
that
my
friends
make
--
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
yes.
i
think
that
argument
that
they
make
first
has
no
applicability
to
this
case,
because
we
did
go
in
for
an
injunction
and
they
opposed
it,
and
the
rule
has
always
been,
i
think,
clear
that
even
if
you
have
a
right
only
to
equity,
if
equity
cannot
be
done,
then
you
can
get
equity
damages,
and
they
certainly
did
everything
to
frustrate
the
granting
--
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
now,
i
want
to
address
myself
to
that.
at
the
time,
that
group
constituted
4%
of
the
shareholders
of
bangor
punta,
and
when
the
rescission-offer
order
was
being
worked
out
in
the
district
court,
bangor
punta
made
a
big
issue
of
the
fact
that
many
of
these
people
had
sold
and
that
therefore
they
shouldn't
get
the
benefit
of
the
rescission
offer
so
that
there's
no
indication
in
this
record
that
there's
a
single
one
left.
but
the
argument
really
proves
too
much,
because
what
it
would
say
is
that
it
would
immunize
a
party
who
gains
control
illegally
by
making
an
exchange
offer
if
he
had
2%,
3%
of
his
shareholders
were
former
shareholders
of
the
target.
now,
look
at
chris-craft.
chris-craft
had
more
shareholders
of
piper
accept
its
exchange
offer.
nobody
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
expresses
any
concern
for
them.
their
only
means
of
getting
any
form
of
restitution
and
compensation
in
this
case
for
the
injury
done
is
if
chris-craft
has
standing
to
sue.
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
yes.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
and
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
mathematics,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
without
each
of
these
blocks,
it
would
have
not
control.
it
needed
both
for
control.
their
argument
on
causation
is
that
even
assuming
they
had
not
acquired
these
shares
illegally,
then
perhaps
they
may
have
on
some
other
day
and
by
some
other
means
acquired
them
legally.
they
speculate
that.
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
yes,
the
court
of
appeals
emphatically
states
that,
and
it's
a
matter
of
mathematics
that
their
control
rests
on
these
illegally
acquired
blocks.
now,
as
i
say,
their
argument
is
that
this
court
should
indulge
in
the
speculation
that
maybe
if
they
hadn't
preempted
the
shares
illegally,
maybe
they
could
have
gotten
them
legally.
well,
ever
since
chief
justice
stone’s
opinion
in
the
bigelow
case,
i
really
think
that
that
argument
has
not
been
heard.
they
also
make
arguments
on
cause
--
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
no,
the
court
of
appeals
distinctly
did
not
find
that,
and
it
really
refused
to
engage
in
that
kind
of
speculation.
it
did
find
in
chris-craft
iii
that
chris-craft’s
plurality,
which
would
have
been
41
to
31,
would
have
commanded
a
premium
which
suggests
the
value
of
it,
and
as
i
say
the
experts
all
testified.
i
think
bangor
punta’s
expert
said
that
with
41
to
31,
he
doesn't
see
how
bangor
punta
could
have
overtaken
chris-craft.
but
i
think
the
problem
is
that
it's
one
that
was
eluded
to
by
mr.
justice
holland
as
a
former
trial
lawyer,
the
problem
of
trying
to
prove
what
somebody
would
have
done
years
after
the
event,
when
actually
he
now
was
faced
with
the
decision
because
his
shares
were
obtained
illegally.
it's
an
possible
burden
of
proof,
and
the
court
was
content
here
to
base
its
holding
on
a
fact
that
without
those
illegal
blocks,
chris-craft
would
have
enjoyed
a
rather
substantial
lead.
now,
as
i
say,
their
concessions
to
legislative
history,
including
the
'70
amendments,
are
to
say
that
chris-craft
should
have
the
power
to
seek
injunctive
relief.
well,
borak
i
thought
ruled
out
the
distinction
between
injunctive
and
legal
relief;
but
in
any
event,
we
did
seek
it,
they
stopped
us;
and
second,
they
say,
"well,
maybe
management
or
the
target
company
should
have
the
right
to
sue,
because
all
the
courts
have
agreed
that
the
target
company
has
the
right
to
sue,
and
if
you
give
the
target
company
the
right
to
sue,
but
not
the
tenderer
--
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
yes.
and
if
you
give
the
target
company
the
right
to
come
into
court,
then
what
would
tip
the
balance
more
contrary
to
congressional
intent
than
not
to
permit
the
tenderer
to
come
into
court?
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
10(b)-6
standing
issue.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
on
10(b)-6
that
there
was
standing
under
birnbaum.
in
the
1973
petition,
bangor
didn't
even
raise
that;
in
fact,
it
didn't
even
raise
birnbaum
as
an
obstacle
in
chris-craft
ii,
and
there
was
a
good
reason
why
the
courts
found
that
there
was
standing,
because
chris-craft
wasn't
the
bystander
of
the
blue
chip
case;
chris-craft
was
a
buyer,
it
was
bidding
for
the
very
shares
that
were
illegally
preempted
here,
and
it
had
a
resting
--
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
that's
right.
and
here
is
a
case
in
which
we
invested
44
million
and
we're
bidding
for
these
shares,
and
they
went
and
preempted
them
illegally.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
amicus
brief
on
cert
at
page
17
notes
that
since
section
14(e)
prescribes
manipulative
and
deceptive
conduct,
that
clearly
an
act
that
violates
a
manipulation
rule
gives
standing
under
section
14(e),
and
if
you
are
really
contemplate
it,
i
think
an
analogy
suggests
itself
to
all
of
us.
this
was
as
if
in
a
football
game
the
referee
blew
the
whistle,
and
one
player
goes
while
everybody
else
has
stopped
play,
runs
to
the
unprotected
goal,
comes
back
and
says
it
should
count,
because
the
referee
really
shouldn't
have
blown
his
whistle;
but
you'd
have
anarchy
if
you
could
permit
that
argument,
and
you'd
have
anarchy
if
that
kind
of
argument
could
be
made
where
somebody
really
willfully
violates
a
rule
of
the
sec.
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
you
have
two
groups
of
shareholders,
of
course,
here.
you
have
the
chris-craft
shareholders,
who
have
lost
what
bangor
punta
is
being
asked
to
pay,
and
therefore
it's
not
a
matter
of
shareholder
versus
some
other
character;
it
is
a
battle
of
shareholders
versus
shareholders.
now,
bangor
punta’s
shareholders
have
remedies
against
their
own
directors.
directors
can
get
and
in
almost
in
all
cases
do
get
liability
insurance,
and
really
the
whole
purpose
of
the
williams
act
was
to
have
prevented
what
happened
here,
was
to
have
prevented
people
from
going
through
red
lights
to
get
control
and
then
later
coming
in
and
saying,
“well,
there
should
be
no
remedy;
we
should
be
able
to
keep
this
illegally
obtained
control.
our
victims
should
have
no
recourse”.
i
really
wonder
whether
in
the
light
of
what
has
happened,
even
with
this
judgment;
but
considering
the
injury
that
chris-craft
had
whether
i
would
have
given
the
advice
that
kravet
did,
which
is
to
abide
by
the
law.
maybe
the
soundest
advice
in
these
contests
is
get
control
by
whatever
means
you
can
and
worry
about
it
later,
and
that's
what
they
pursued
here.
now,
on
the
--
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
i
would
contend
both,
that
because
10(b)-6
does
not
have
the
in-connection-with
language
that
birnbaum
should
not
be
applied
to
it;
but
i
contend
more
than
that
that
section
14(e)
gives
us
that
standing,
and
that
in
any
event
chris-craft
was
not
only
a
buyer
here
to
the
tune
of
$44
million;
it
was
a
bidder
for
the
very
stock
which
they
illegally
preempted.
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
well,
it's
because
i
think
that
the
10(b)-6
violation
has
to
be
viewed
in
the
contest
of
a
tender
contest,
and
section
14(e)
was
adopted
for
the
regulation
of
the
conduct
of
tenders
...
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
…
and
it
does
contain
language
that
you
shouldn't
engage
in
deceptive
conduct,
and
i
contend
that
what
happened
here
violates
that,
too.
going
beyond
that,
on
scienter,
the
court
of
appeals
has
been
made
out
here
to
have
applied
some
standards
that
were
pre-hochfelder
and
that
didn't
really
conform
with
hochfelder.
well,
in
the
first
place,
the
violations
here
were
knowing
violations.
the
violation
of
rule
10(b)-6
was
a
knowing
violation,
the
violations
by
the
pipers
were
knowing
violations
characterized
by
a
scorched-earth
policy,
and
the
violation
on
the
bar
--
and
i
didn't
get
into
the
facts,
though
they're
set
forth
in
our
brief
--
couldn't
have
been
more
knowing.
it
had
to
be
judged
in
a
context
of
competing
exchange
offers,
which
were
perceived
by
the
public
to
be
identical.
christ-craft
got
112,000
shares;
they
got
111,600
shares.
and
here
they
had
an
asset
at
an
answer
to
a
question
from
the
bench.
this
railroad
in
the
first
two
of
the
last
five
years
had
earned
one-third
of
bangor
punta’s
income.
they
had
an
asset
which
was
being
proffered
to
the
public
as
having
a
value
of
18
million
on
a
market-price
valuation
in
a
section
of
their
prospectus
which
was
updated
to
september
1968,
and
the
district
court
said
that
no
director
of
bangor
punta
could
have
believed
that
it
had
that
value,
and
the
reason
that
they
couldn't
have
believed
it
is
that
on
may
22,
the
board
had
received
a
recommendation
unanimously
from
its
committee
to
sell
this
railroad
for
5
million;
the
only
dissenting
voice
was
that
it
should
be
sold
at
7
million.
they
now
come
into
this
court
and
say,
"well,
of
course
we
never
believed
that
it
had
this
$18
million
market
value,
and
we
never
contended
otherwise."
they
did,
in
fact,
contend
otherwise
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
if
i
had
the
time
i
could
quote
from
their
brief
there.
the
fact
is
that
they
presented
this
railroad
as
having
an
$18
million
value;
it
had
a
$5
million
value.
they
did
not
warn
or
even
hint
in
their
prospectus
that
this
railroad
was
on
the
block
and
that
this
kind
of
loss
could
be
incurred.
the
loss
would
have
wiped
out
the
earnings,
and
you
would
have
therefore
had
a
red
number
in
their
prospectus
going
against
the
black
number
in
the
chris-craft
prospectus.
it
would
have
wiped
out
36%
of
the
…
mr.
arthur
l.
liman
right.
the
district
court
found
that
there
had
been
no
agreement
to
sell.
it
found
that
no
director
could
have
believed
that
it
had
the
value;
and,
in
fact,
it
found
also
that
the
head
of
the
negotiating
committee,
hutchins,
had
reached
what
he
believed
to
be
a
conclusive
agreement
with
the
buyer,
which
was
memorialized
in
a
memorandum
of
the
buyer
which
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
which
said
that
the
sale
would
take
place
two
months
after
the
exchange
offer
was
completed,
and
it
occurred
exactly
then.
but
the
important
thing
was
that
the
district
court
said
they
couldn't
have
believed
that
it
had
this
inflated
value.
now,
they
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
improper
standards
of
scienter.
well,
judge
gurfein
said
that
their
conduct
was
recklessness
equivalent
to
willful
fraud.
judge
mansfield
said,
citing
texas
gulf
sulphur,
that
they
ignored
red
flags
and
warning
signals.
judge
timbers
said
that
their
conduct
was
worse,
and
their
scienter
arguments
were
dismissed
in
christ-craft
iii
where
they
said
it
was
just
negligence
and
wasn't
reckless
as
being
frivolous.
that's
strong
words
for
the
second
circuit
to
use
unanimously.
there
was
no
finding
in
this
record
that
they
relied
on
professionals.
the
only
advice
they
ever
got
from
an
accountant
was
that
if
they
sold
this
railroad,
they'd
have
this
enormous
loss
of
$13
million.
i
observe
that
my
time
is
finished.
my
brief
covers
the
other
points.
