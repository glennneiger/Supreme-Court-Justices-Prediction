unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
the
violations,
however
they're
characterized,
caused
no
injury?
unknown
speaker
so
the
trial
court
held
that
that
rendered
the
valuation
obsolete?
unknown
speaker
now,
this
is
in
the
sec
action?
unknown
speaker
not
in
this
action.
unknown
speaker
right,
i
see.
unknown
speaker
was
judge
pollack
the
trial
judge
in
each
case
each
time?
unknown
speaker
judge
tenney
was
in
there
earlier,
wasn't
he?
unknown
speaker
you
accept
that
as
the
law,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
that's
a
little
more
than
scienter,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
intent
is
more
than
simply
scienter.
unknown
speaker
which
was
left
open.
unknown
speaker
this
is
based
on
events
that
occurred
before
first
boston
was
in
the
picture,
is
that
not
so?
when
did
first
boston
get
in
in
terms
of
the
â€¦
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
scienter
was
a
substitute
not
merely
for
intent,
but
also
for
causation.
unknown
speaker
standing.
unknown
speaker
suppose
we
agree
with
you,
judge.
should
we
decide
that
question
here
or
remand
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
reconsider
in
the
light
of
hochfelder?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
date
of
ernst
&
ernst,
do
you
remember?
unknown
speaker
march
30th,
1976.
unknown
speaker
and
we
granted
certiorari
after
that,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
maybe
it
was
our
mistake.
unknown
speaker
did
they
oppose
divestiture
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
appropriate
relief
or
on
the
ground
that
they
then
were
disputing
the
liability
issues?
unknown
speaker
just
so
i
have
it
sorted
out,
when
did
the
case
finally
become
just
a
damage
case
was
after
chris-craft,
the
court
of
appeals'
second
opinion,
then?
unknown
speaker
you're
talking
about
the
piper
individuals.
unknown
speaker
mr.
liman,
may
i
interrupt
you
there?
you
say
it
went
behind
the
back
of
the
sec.
my
recollection
of
what
i
read
in
the
briefs
is
that
the
sec
had
had
no
communication
with
bangor
punta
on
this
issue
prior
to
that
time.
unknown
speaker
they
issued
a
release,
what,
three
days
before?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
was
that
the
first
indication
publicly
by
the
sec
of
that
new
interpretation
of
the
meaning
of
10(b)-6?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
the
record
show
that
bangor
punta
made
a
public
announcement
on
may
16th
that
it
had
made
these
purchases?
unknown
speaker
yes.
was
that
going
behind
the
back,
in
your
judgment?
unknown
speaker
it
may
possibly
be
relevant
to
the
issue
of
intent,
might
it
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
liman,
you
refer
repeatedly
to
acting
contrary
to
instructions
of
counsel.
i
was
under
the
impression
that
company
counsel
at
least
advised
bangor
punta
that
it
was
appropriate
for
it
to
make
these
purchases.
unknown
speaker
is
this
inside
counsel
or
company
counsel?
unknown
speaker
mr.
liman,
as
i
understand
it
and
i
think
i'm
correct,
there's
no
question
raised
in
this
case
as
to
the
fact
of
the
violation
of
10(b)-6.
so
we
could
assume
that
everything
you
say
is
right,
that
there
was
a
violation
of
10(b)-6
and
that
your
client
was
injured.
the
real
question,
the
preliminary
question
at
least,
is
whether
or
not
given
those
facts,
you
have
a
right
of
action,
an
implied
right
of
action,
a
civil
right
of
action
under
either
10(b)-6
or
14(e),
and
that's
the
big
threshold
question
in
the
case,
assuming
everything
you
tell
us
is
true,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
let's
get
to
that.
unknown
speaker
was
congress
told
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
reliable
is
that,
mr.
liman?
you're
talking
now
about
the
testimony
of
a
witness,
admittedly
the
chairman
of
the
sec,
before
a
committee.
that
isn't
a
very
high-grade
legislative
history,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
remark
as
supporting
the
implication
of
a
private
cause
of
action
on
behalf
of
one
of
the
tenderers?
unknown
speaker
who
was
that?
unknown
speaker
now,
this
again,
now,
let's
see
what
grade
of
legislative
history
this
is.
this
is
a
letter
from
the
sec
to
whom?
unknown
speaker
this
qualifies
as
legislative
history,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
know
congress
acted
on
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
might
mean
theoretically
that
in
some
future
case,
somebody
might
sue
in
litigation
like
this
who
said,
"i
was
deterred
from
buying
piper
aircrafts
stock
and
therefore,
in
this
kind
of
case,
i'm
not
barred
by
the
blue
chip
birnbaum
rule".
that
is
the
most
that
that
could
mean
in
your
submission.
unknown
speaker
mr.
liman,
before
you
move
on
to
the
commentators,
also
chairman
cohen
on
the
same
occasion
testified,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
williams
act
is
not
designed
to
assist
the
offeror
nor
designed
to
assist
the
management
in
resisting
any
plans
put
forward
by
the
offeror.
it
is
essentially
based
on
a
concept
that
the
investor
should
have
the
information,
so
he
can
arrive
at
a
proper
decision.
now,
the
part
you
rely
on
is
sandwiched
between
the
part
the
chief
justice
quotes
--
unknown
speaker
confer
standing
on
whom?
unknown
speaker
to
collect
money
damages?
four
cases?
unknown
speaker
mr.
liman,
before
you
leave
the
14(e)
standing
issue,
would
you
respond
to
their
argument
that
even
assuming
you
might
have
standing
in
an
equity
case
and
so
forth,
when
you
get
standing
in
a
damage
suit,
the
recovery
adversely
affects
the
people
who
are
the
principal
beneficiaries
of
the
legislation,
namely,
the
general
rules
of
exchange?
unknown
speaker
but
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
apparently
there
are
some
bangor
punta
shareholders
who
exchanged
chris-craft
stock,
the
value
of
whose
shares
will
be
declined
because
of
the
$35
million
--
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
factual
finding,
then,
in
the
record
by
one
of
the
courts
that
there
was
a
factual
causal
connection
between
the
violations
and
the
ultimate
acquisition
of
control?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
also
found
or
had
to
find
that
without
the
control
of
bangor
punta
that
chris-craft
would
have
obtained
it?
unknown
speaker
that
is,
the
courts
have
agreed
that
the
target
company
has
the
right
to
try
to
get
an
injunction.
unknown
speaker
you're
referring
to
standing
as
whether
chris-craft
has
a
cause
of
action.
unknown
speaker
mr.
liman,
shareholders
ultimately
pay
the
bill
for
these
things,
strongly
supported
by
what
senator
kuchel
said
when
he
introduced
the
bill
and
what
senator
williams
said
and
what
other
witnesses
said
that
their
concern
was
for
the
shareholder
and
no
one
else.
how
do
you
protect
the
shareholders
by
putting
a
burden
on
them
into
millions
of
dollars
in
judgments?
unknown
speaker
mr.
liman,
let
me
go
back
to
the
10(b)-6
standing.
i'm
just
not
quite
sure
i
understand
your
position.
you
contend
that
chris-craft
was
a
purchaser
within
the
meaning
of
the
birnbaum
rule
or
that
the
birnbaum
rule
does
not
apply
to
10(b)-6?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
that
relevance
of
14(e)
to
the
10(b)-6
standing
issue.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see
what
you're
saying.
unknown
speaker
i
had
understood
that
the
district
court
found
that
there
had
been
no
agreement
on
the
part
of
bangor
punta
to
sell
the
bar
railroad
stock
at
the
time
the
prospectus
was
issued
and
after
the
sale
it
could
,
as
i
recall,
in
october.
it
could
have
been
much
later.
