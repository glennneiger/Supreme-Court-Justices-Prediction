mr.
paul
g.
pennoyer,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
speaking
in
behalf
of
the
piper
individuals
at
a
slow
gallop
for
five
minutes,
i'd
like
to
discuss
the
issues
of
causation
damages
and
the
issue
of
scienter
and
touch
briefly
on
the
issue
of
individual
liability
and
joint
several
liability.
on
the
question
of
causation
damages
--
and
i
won't
repeat
the
legal
points
made
by
my
colleagues,
but
solely
the
facts
--
the
sole
basis
for
this
$36
million
judgment
against
the
piper
individuals
hangs
on
three
communications
sent
by
piper
management
in
january
of
1969
in
the
course
of
chris-craft’s
cash-tender
offer
for
300,000
shares
for
$65
a
share
at
a
time
when
chris-craft
needed
about
620,000
shares
to
get
control
and
at
a
time
when
it
said
right
in
its
cash-tender
offer
that
it
did
not
intend
by
that
cash-tender
offer
to
acquire
control.
now,
the
piper
contribution
to
chris-craft’s
lost
opportunity
to
get
control
seven
months
later
hangs
in
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
on
a
presumption.
chris-craft
tells
this
court
that
but
for
the
acts
of
others
later,
it
was
a
sure
winner
and
would
have
had
a
99%
chance
of
getting
control;
so
that
against
the
position
of
the
party,
the
court
of
appeals
nevertheless
makes
a
presumption
that
the
action
of
the
pipers
in
communicating
as
they
did
in
january
had
caused
this
lost
opportunity
seven
months
later.
we
say
that
it
is
conflict
to
the
lesson
of
mills,
and
i
will
touch
that
no
further;
we've
covered
it
in
our
brief.
on
the
question
of
scienter,
the
district
court
as
trier
of
fact
construed
the
two
letters
that
was
sent
in
january
--
and
i
might
say
they
are
all
reproduced
in
the
reply
brief
--
construed
the
statement
the
management
is
convinced
the
offer
is
inadequate
as
a
reference
to
the
offer
as
a
whole.
the
court
of
appeals
simply
disagreed
and
gave
its
own
construction,
concluding
that
the
reference
was
to
price
and
based
on
its
own
construction
declared
that
this
letters
were
materially
misleading
and
therefore,
said
the
court
of
appeals,
the
pipers
or
the
piper
management
in
sending
the
letters
recklessly
and
knowingly
disregarded
its
obligations
to
shareholders.
similarly
with
the
other,
the
third
communication,
the
grumman
press
release,
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
one
of
the
many
terms
of
the
agreement
should
have
been
specified
in
the
joint
press
release
put
out
by
grumman
and
the
pipers,
the
term,
that
is,
that
dealt
with
a
right
to
resell
the
shares
to
piper.
the
court
of
appeals
said
without
that
provision
in
the
press
release,
there
was
a
material
omission
and
therefore,
said
the
court
of
appeals,
the
piper
management,
in
issuing
the
press
release,
recklessly
and
knowingly
disregarded
its
obligations
to
shareholders.
mr.
paul
g.
pennoyer,
jr.
yes,
we
would
not
question
that
in
a
private
suit
by
shareholders,
it
might
be.
we
do
not
agree
that
it
was
a
material
omission
or
that
the
letters
were
materially
misleading.
but
certainly
it
would
have
more
relevance
in
a
suit
by
a
private
shareholder.
now,
the
district
court
for
chris-craft,
let
me
say,
would
infer
scienter
--
and
this
is
the
only
basis
of
scienter
that
i've
already
mentioned
--
on
the
basis
of
the
piper
management’s
opposition
to
its
tender
offer
and
to
chris-craft
generally;
but
we
say
that
opposition
to
chris-craft
does
not
equate
with
intention
to
deceive.
the
district
court
heard
the
witnesses.
it
heard
william
piper;
it
heard
non-piper
family
management
director
witnesses
on
the
question
of
these
communications.
chris-craft
stipulated
that
the
letters
were
prepared
by
proxies
listed
and
interviewed
by
counsel,
and
piper
testified
that
counsel
advised
them
as
to
what
needed
to
be
said
in
the
press
release.
now,
with
respect
to
individual
liability,
while
the
whole
piper
board
--
mr.
paul
g.
pennoyer,
jr.
well,
then,
i
will
simply
close
with
this
statement,
that
individual
liability,
a
violation
of
a
fiduciary
obligation
to
shareholders,
was
found
on
the
basis
of
a
single
footnote
sentence
that
the
pipers
in
sending
the
letters
acted
in
their
own
interest
and
not
in
the
interest
of
the
shareholders.
