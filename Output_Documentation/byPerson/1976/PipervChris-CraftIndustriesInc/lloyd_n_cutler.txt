mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
three
sets
of
petitioners
in
this
case,
held
jointly
and
severally
liable
on
different
combinations
of
events.
i
shall
argue
for
bangor
punta;
judge
peck
shall
argue
for
first
boston;
and
mr.
pennoyer
will
argue
for
the
piper
family
defendants.
this
case
involves
a
bid
by
chris-craft
to
take
over
the
piper
aircraft
company
in
january
of
1969.
the
bid
was
resisted
by
management,
including
members
of
the
piper
family.
in
april
of
1969,
piper’s
financial
advisor,
first
boston,
invited
bangor
punta
to
submit
a
competing
bid.
bangor
did
so
and
won
in
the
marketplace.
chris-craft
went
to
court
and
won
a
$36
million
judgment,
the
largest
ever
rendered
in
a
private
action
under
the
securities
laws
and
far
more
than
any
conceivable
difference
between
the
value
of
the
42%
of
piper
that
chris-craft
still
owns
and
the
51%
that
it
sought.
if
you
will
pick
up,
your
honors,
the
blue-covered
bangor
brief
and
look
at
page
9
--
that's
our
main
brief
--
you
will
find
that
a
table
summarizing
the
control
contest,
of
which
the
clerk
has
extra
copies.
two
technical
violations
of
the
securities
laws
were
found
against
bangor
punta.
the
first
related
to
item
5
on
that
table.
when
after
announcing
its
intention
to
make
an
exchange
offer
for
piper
shares
bangor
bought
three
blocks
from
institutions
in
off-exchange
transactions,
in
a
first-impression
ruling
on
the
application
of
fcc
rule
10(b)-6,
these
purchases
of
piper
shares
were
held
to
have
violated
the
rule,
even
though
they
were
found
below
to
have
been
made
without
any
manipulative
intent
or
effect.
the
second
violation
was
found
in
connection
with
item
7
on
that
table.
bangor’s
exchange
prospectus
did
not
mention
an
offer
it
had
received
to
buy
one
of
its
assets,
the
bangor
&
aroostock
railroad,
at
a
price
in
cash
well
below
its
carrying
value
on
bangor’s
books.
in
an
sec
injunctive
suit
that
was
tried
together
with
the
chris-craft
private
suit,
the
district
court
found
that
this
submission
was
made
in
good
faith
and
without
intent
to
mislead.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
use
it
in
the
sense,
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
violations
were,
as
i
just
said,
found
by
the
district
court
to
have
been
made
in
good
faith
and
without
intent
to
mislead.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
that's
correct,
justice
stewart.
we
argued
below
and
we
still
believe
that
they
were
not
violations,
but
we
did
not
think
either
issue
as
to
violation
was
of
sufficient
importance
to
raise
on
certiorari
on
those
particular
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
right.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
it
is
our
position
that
the
violations
caused
no
injury
to
chris-craft,
the
plaintiff
in
this
action,
or
indeed
to
anyone
else.
the
court
below,
the
trial
court,
expressly
rejected
charges
that
bangor
had
already
accepted
that
offer
to
buy
the
railroad
or
that
it
had
even
decided
to
accept
the
offer,
and
they
also
rejected
charges
that
a
loss
should
have
been
recorded
in
bangor’s
financial
statements.
but
the
court
found
that
the
failure
to
mention
the
offer
was
material,
because
the
offer
made
the
carrying
value
obsolete,
as
the
trial
court
said,
absolute
disclosure,
and
it
ordered
bangor
to
provide
the
exchanging
piper
shareholders
an
opportunity
to
rescind,
which
none
of
them
accepted.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
that
carrying
value
was
obsolete
was
the
trial
court’s
word
without
some
mention
of
the
fact
that
the
offer
had
been
received.
it
did
not
say
that
the
carrying
value
should
be
changed,
but
that
some
mention
should
have
been
made
of
the
fact
that
the
offer
had
been
received.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
this
was
in
the
sec
action
that
carried
over
to
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
it
also
carried
over
to
the
private
action,
justice
stewart,
yes.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
as
i
said,
the
court
ordered
bangor
to
provide
an
opportunity
to
rescind
to
the
accepting
piper
shareholders,
which
none
of
them
accepted
because
the
market
value
of
the
bangor
exchange
package
continued
at
all
times
to
be
higher
than
the
value
of
the
piper
shares
that
had
been
offered
in
exchange.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
that
offer
was
made
in,
i
believe,
march
of
1976,
justice
stevens,
the
delay
from
the
time
that
cert
was
denied
in
this
court
on
the
original
order
having
occurred
primarily
because
the
four
chris-craft
directors
of
piper
representing
their
42%
were
anxious,
since
piper
had
to
issue
a
prospectus
or
a
registration
relating
to
this
exchange
offer,
that
independent
counsel
be
retained
for
that
purpose
and
that
updated
financials
be
provided,
and
that
delay
was
entirely
satisfactory
to
the
sec,
the
enforcing
arm.
but
it
made
no
real
difference,
because
at
all
times,
as
i
said,
throughout,
the
value
of
the
bangor
package
was
higher,
and
no
one
rescinded.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
all
of
these
particular
findings
and
orders
relating
to
the
sec
case,
and
in
that
action
the
sec
obtained
all
of
the
relief
that
was
appropriate
for
the
exchanging
piper
shareholders,
none
of
whom
have
brought
any
private
damage
action
of
their
own.
now,
chris-craft’s
private
action
has
been
before
the
second
circuit
three
times,
and
each
time
the
second
circuit
reversed
the
district
court
on
the
critical
points
of
law
that
are
now
here
for
review.
in
so
doing,
the
court
created
an
implied
damage
action
for
a
non-purchaser
under
rule
10(b)-6,
in
conflict
we
say
with
this
court’s
ruling
in
blue
chip.
it
created
an
implied
action
for
a
competing
offeror
under
14(e),
in
conflict
we
say
with
the
principles
of
this
court’s
later
opinion
in
cort
against
ash.
it
held
scienter
was
required,
but
defined
it
to
equal
mere
awareness
of
the
undisclosed
fact
about
those
railroad
negotiations,
which
we
say
is
in
conflict
with
this
court’s
later
opinion
in
hochfelder,
and
it
found
causation
on
the
basis
of
presumptions,
despite
findings
in
the
trial
court
that
causal
effect
had
not
been
proven.
it
computed
damages
itself
under
a
theory
that
wrongly
insured
chris-craft
against
the
later
and
unrelated
decline
in
the
value
of
the
piper
shares,
and
that
confused
the
value
of
control
with
a
mere
opportunity
to
compete
for
control.
now,
mr.
liman
is
doubtless
going
to
tell
you
a
more
colorful
tale,
in
which
he'll
portray
chris-craft
as
a
victim
of
the
greatest
securities
fraud
since
the
mississippi
bubble;
but
chris-craft’s
tale
utterly
failed
to
convince
the
district
court,
which
as
i
have
said
found
that
bangor’s
technical
violations
were
made
in
good
faith
and
without
intent
to
deceive.
we
assume
that
this
court
did
not
grant
certiorari
to
retry
these
findings
of
the
experienced
trial-judge
findings,
which
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
judge
pollack
was
the
trial
judge
in
all
of
the
matters
of
which
i
have
spoken.
that
was
judge
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
there
was
an
earlier
chris-craft
suit
for
a
preliminary
injunction
tried
by
judge
tenney.
i
want
to
turn
first
to
whether
congress
intended
to
create
these
private
damage
actions
that
chris-craft
is
now
pursuing.
as
to
rule
10(b)-6,
it
seems
that
to
us
that
blue
chip
just
settles
the
issue.
christ-craft
did
not
purchase
any
of
the
bangor
securities
that
were
offered
in
distribution,
and
the
violation
was
not
committed
in
connection
with,
those
words
of
10(b),
any
of
the
piper
stock
that
was
purchased
by
chris-craft.
as
to
14(e),
whether
any
private
damage
action
was
created
under
14(e)
should
be
implied,
or
any
other
section
of
the
williams
act,
has
not
been
squarely
passed
on
by
this
court.
under
cort
against
ash
in
wyandot,
courts
have
implied
damage
remedies
only
when
the
plaintiff
is
within
the
class
for
whose
special
benefit,
as
the
court
says,
congress
acted
and
only
when
the
harm
alleged
to
him
is
the
type
of
harm
that
congress
wanted
to
prevent.
on
rondeau,
this
court
held
that
target-company
shareholders
are
the
class
that
congress
wanted
to
protect
in
the
williams
act,
and
it
indicated
that
the
harm
to
them
from
a
violation
is
the
only
type
of
harm
that
congress
wanted
to
prevent.
i
think
our
briefs
make
clear
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
language
or
the
legislative
intent
of
the
williams
act
that
shows
congress
intended
in
14(e)
to
confer
rights
on
anyone
other
than
the
target-company
shareholders
or
to
prevent
any
harm
suffered
by
a
competing
offeror,
but
not
suffered
by
the
target
shareholders
as
a
class.
as
our
briefs
show,
congress
gave
no
clue
that
it
wanted
to,
and
neither
did
the
sec
draft
through
the
williams
act
or
anyone
who
testified
in
its
favor.
now,
chris-craft,
while
it
holds
piper
stock,
is
very
plainly
not
suing
in
that
capacity
any
more
than
a
displaced
officer
or
director
of
a
target
company
would
be
suing
in
his
capacity
as
a
shareholder
if
he
was
suing
to
recover
the
fees
and
the
salaries
he
lost
because
the
new
people
in
control
kicked
him
out.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
he
can
go.
he
may
very
well
be
able
to
go,
justice
stewart,
into
a
federal
court
to
seek
an
injunction;
but
as
i
will
reach
in
a
moment,
it
seems
to
us
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
right,
an
injunction
against
the
competing
offeror
in
order
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
protected
class,
the
target
company's
shareholders,
and
only
in
all
the
cases
to
date
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
we
do
not
challenge,
that
and
as
i'll
show
in
the
moment,
when
congress
has
legislated
both
expressed
private
injunctive
and
private
damage
remedies,
it
has
frequently
granted
a
wider
class
the
right
to
sue
for
an
injunction
than
the
class
that
is
allowed
to
sue
for
damages
to
itself.
now,
what
chris-craft
is
asking
for
here
is
the
damages
for
the
loss
of
this
opportunity
to
compete
for
control,
something
no
other
target
shareholder
can
have.
it's
more
than
any
other
target
shareholder
could
collect;
and
moreover,
they're
trying
to
collect
it
at
the
ultimate
expense
of
the
very
target
shareholders,
the
innocent
shareholders
who
accepted
the
bangor’s
securities
in
the
exchange
offer
and
now
hold
bangor
stock,
and
that
ironic
result
is
going
to
occur
in
every
case
of
competing
exchange
offers
if
the
loser
is
allowed
to
recover
damages
against
the
winner.
and
what
we
put
to
you
is,
is
it
reasonable
to
believe
that
target
shareholders,
who
are
the
supposed
victims
of
the
violation,
but
who
are
not
complaining
themselves,
ought
to
be
turned
into
defendants
instead
of
plaintiffs
and
are
to
be
injured
by
the
judgment
that's
supposed
to
protect
them?
yet,
the
court
of
appeals
here
said
that
evidence
of
legislative
attempt
was
unnecessary
and
that
under
common-law
tort
principles,
chris-craft
should
have
a
federal
damage
remedy,
simply
because
it
claimed
injury
from
a
violation
of
the
federal
statute.
but
there
is
supposed
to
be
no
federal
common
law,
and
there
is
no
universal
statutory
principle
of
a
federal
damage
remedy,
for
everyone
claiming
violation
or
injury
from
a
violation
of
the
federal
statute.
and
when
your
honors
look
at
the
private
remedies
that
congress
has
expressly
created
in
the
securities
laws
and
many
other
laws,
you'll
find
that
they've
weighed
a
variety
of
competing
policy
considerations
and
come
out
with
a
variety
of
answers.
sometimes,
as
if
the
food
and
drug
act,
federal
trade
commission
act,
courts
have
held
that
congress
created
no
private
remedies
at
all.
sometimes,
as
water
pollution
and
the
toxic
substances
act
that's
now
before
the
president,
congress
has
created
a
private
injunctive
remedy,
but
not
a
damage
remedy.
and
as
in
the
clayton
act
and
in
the
opinion
in
hawaii,
justice
marshal,
where
congress
created
both
types
of
remedies,
the
court
held
that
congress
gave
a
broader
class
the
right
to
sue
for
the
injunction
than
the
class
it
gave
the
right
to
sue
for
damages;
and
that's
why,
justice
stewart,
the
cases
that
do
allow
persons
outside
the
protected
class
to
seek
injunctions
in
order
to
protect
the
class
don't
establish
that
congress
meant
to
give
those
same
people
the
right
to
sue
for
damages
to
themselves.
now,
in
the
securities
laws
themselves,
congress
has
always
created
damage
remedies
on
what
the
opinion
in
hochfelder
called
a
"particularized
basis"
for
a
limited
type
of
harm
and
a
limited
degree
of
culpability
and
for
a
limited
class
of
plaintiffs.
that's
the
principle
that
blue
chip
and
hochfelder
follow
and
the
opinion
below
does
not.
let
me
come
now
to
scienter.
in
hochfelder,
the
court
ruled
that
scienter
is
required
in
a
private
damage
action
under
10(b)
and
also
the
sec
rule
issued
under
10(b),
and
it
defines
scienter
as
"a
mental
state
embracing
intent
to
deceive,
manipulate
and
defraud".
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
well,
that
was
the
definition
of
scienter
expressly
used
in
hochfelder
with
a
reservation
i'm
about
to
come
to
dealing
with
recklessness,
a
point
which
was
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
right.
this
decision
was
issued
before
hochfelder,
and
it
held
that
no
such
intent
was
required.
as
for
the
10(b)-6
violation,
it
seems
to
us
hochfelder
very
plainly
controls,
and
the
district
court’s
findings
of
no
manipulative
intent
or
effect,
affirmed
on
appeal,
conclude
the
issue.
the
court
of
appeals
here
recognized
that
scienter
was
required,
because
14(e)
had
been
modeled
on
10(b)-5;
but
after
it
affirmed
the
trial
court’s
finding
that
the
omission
concerning
the
railroad
negotiations
had
been
made
in
good
faith
and
without
intent
to
mislead,
the
second
circuit
found
scienter
in
bangor’s
and
first
boston’s
mere
awareness
of
the
negotiations,
a
standard
totally
incompatible,
we
say,
with
the
intent
to
deceive
that
was
required
by
hochfelder.
in
hochfelder,
justice
stewart,
as
you
noted,
the
court
left
open
the
question
whether
recklessness
could
ever
meet
the
same
requirement.
but
that,
as
judge
friendly
had
said
earlier,
was
the
kind
of
recklessness
that's
equivalent
to
willful
fraud,
and
no
such
recklessness
in
that
sense
could
possibly
have
been
involved
here.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
if
you
agreed
with
us
that
this
was
not
recklessness,
justice
white,
yes,
we
think
it
would
be
dispositive.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
of
the
entire
case.
every
one
of
the
four
points
i
had
hoped
to
argue
and
cannot
get
to
causation
and
damages
is
dispositive.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
yes,
your
honor,
precisely.
the
omission
here
was
one
that
was
fully
discussed
between
bangor
and
first
boston
and
experienced
counsel
for
both
of
them.
it
was
deemed
appropriate
by
all
of
them
in
good
faith.
and
while
in
hindsight
it
may
have
been
in
error,
that
kind
of
decision,
it
doesn't
seem
to
us,
can
possibly
fit
within
hochfelder’s
description
of
recklessness,
especially
when
the
courts
below
both
concluded
that
there
was
no
intent
to
mislead
and
that
everything
had
been
done
in
good
faith.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
practically
none.
as
the
record
does
show,
justice
powell,
the
earnings
i
think
in
the
last
pertinent
year
amounted
to
$60,000,
and
when
the
bar
was
sold,
even
prime-rate
interest
on
the
$5
million
in
cash
that
was
later
received
when
it
was
later
sold
is
obviously
far
more
than
$60,000.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
well,
there
is
the
objective
fact,
justice
powell,
as
judge
peck
will
develop,
that
when
the
railroad
was,
in
fact,
sold
for
$5
million
in
cash
after
this
exchange
offer
terminated,
the
price
of
bangor
punta
stock
went
up
within
the
succeeding
two
weeks.
now,
i
may
have
missed
my
lights,
mr.
chief
justice.
have
i
used
…
i
was
supposed
to
have
20
minutes
at
the
beginning.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
total,
yes.
well,
i
think
then,
sir,
i
had
better
leave
the
issues
of
causation
and
damages,
each
of
which
would
also
be
dispositive
to
my
brief,
reserving
five
minutes
for
rebuttal,
and
i
may
have
an
opportunity
to
comment
on
both
then.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
yes,
sir.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
your
second
question
was
the
first
one
i
wanted
to
take
up,
justice
stevens;
so
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
answer
that
first.
when
i
said
that
the
issue
of
violation
was
not
in
the
case,
even
as
to
14(e),
i
should
have
mentioned
that
as
our
certiorari
petition
itself
states
and
as
the
questions
present
state,
we
raise
the
question
of
whether
damages
are
recoverable
under
14(e)
absent
scienter
in
the
hochfelder
sense.
so
that
is
an
issue
in
the
case.
could
you
repeat
your
first
question
again,
justice
stevens?
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
right.
we
would
concede
that
the
corporation
as
distinguished
from
management
interested
in
its
perks,
its
salaries
or
fees
in
case
it
got
thrown
out,
but
that
the
corporation
has
standing
certainly
to
sue
for
an
injunction
to
protect
the
target
shareholders
and
perhaps
even
to
sue
for
damages
for
the
corporation,
which
would
protect
the
target
shareholders.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
piper.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
there
was
a
counterclaim
by
bangor
punta,
which
was
a
counterclaim
once
chris-craft
had
sued
us;
but
our
answer
to
bangor
punta
--
it
was
a
stipulated
answer
--
specifically
raised
the
question
of
what
we've
been
calling
here
their
standing
to
sue,
whether
there
was
liability
for
damages.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
was
speaking
of
the
management
having
standing
to
sue
the
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--
tender
offeror.
in
this
case,
of
course,
we
have
two
tender
offerors.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
but
let's
say
one
tender
offeror
for
an
injunction
or
to
recover
damages
perhaps
for
the
benefit
of
the
target
shareholders
who
are
all
members
of
that
corporation.
and
i
did
say
in
answer
to
a
question
from
justice
stewart
earlier
that
perhaps
even
a
competing
tender
offeror
would
have
standing
to
sue
for
an
injunction
to
prevent
injury
to
the
shareholders.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
but
the
test,
as
i
think
the
chief
justice’s
opinion
in
rondeau
makes
very
clear,
is,
can
you
show
some
injury
to
the
shareholders.
and
while
i'm
on
that
point
and
you
have
further
questions,
justice
stevens,
while
it
is
true,
of
course,
that
some
of
the
exchanging
piper
shareholders
owned
chris-craft
stock,
it
would
seem
to
me,
number
one,
that
their
injury
is
not
of
an
injury
of
the
kind
we
need
consider
here,
because
the
principal
violation
is
one
relating
to
the
bangor
tender
offer,
the
one
they
didn't
accept.
they
accepted
the
other
offer.
moreover,
given
a
case
in
which
some
of
the
target
shareholders
are
on
one
side
of
the
damage
and
some
are
on
the
other
side,
congress
might
very
well
have
left
that
particular
issue
alone
and
said
no
damage
remedy,
just
as
the
district
court
really
did
here.
i'd
like
to
come
next
to
the
question
of
whether
the
14½%
which
mr.
liman
says
were
involved
in
the
two
violations
was
decisive.
you
have
an
express
finding
on
that
from
the
district
court
that
after
both
of
those
violations
at
the
time
that
the
preliminary
injunction
was
denied
that
neither
party
has
gained
control
and
both
are
in
a
position
to
do
so.
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals,
when
it
was
affirming
that
finding,
said
each
side
had
an
equal
opportunity
to
gain
control.
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
to
misinterpret
mills
--
and
this
is
a
point
i
don't
have
time
for
now,
which
will
be
covered
in
our
brief
--
to
presume
both
that
the
target
shareholders
would
have
rejected
the
offer,
and
of
course
mills
invokes
no
presumptions
and
turns
only
on
the
point
that
the
target
shareholders
were
entitled
to
a
clean
and
accurate
prospectus
or
proxy,
whether
or
not
it
would
have
affected
their
offer;
and
secondly,
he
made
the
presumption,
which
mills
certainly
doesn't
authorize
because
it
said
damages
should
be
awarded
only
to
the
extent
they
can
be
proven,
that
the
violation
caused
chris-craft
to
lose
its
opportunity
for
control.
is
that
all
the
time
i
have?
thank
you,
sir.
