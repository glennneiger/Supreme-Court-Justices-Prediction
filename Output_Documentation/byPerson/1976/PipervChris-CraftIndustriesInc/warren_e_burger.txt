chief

e.

mr.
liman,
as
long
as
you're
relying
on
mr.
cohen
as
chairman
of
the
sec,
when
did
he
use
the
language
that
we
find
in
this
legislative
history,
or
in
the
reports,
i
should
say:
“we
are
concerned
with
the
investor,
who
today
is
just
a
pawn
in
the
form
of
industrial
warfare.
the
investor
is
lost
somewhere
in
the
shuffle.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
he
said
also,
"the
only
thing
the
bill
is
designed
to
do
is
to
make
effective
the
purpose
of
the
bill
so
the
information
which
is
to
be
provided
to
the
investor
does,
in
fact,
get
to
him."
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
liman.
