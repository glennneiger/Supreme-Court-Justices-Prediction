mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
production
and
sale
of
apples
has
played
a
major
role
in
the
economy
of
the
state
of
washington
for
many
decades.
as
a
result
the
state
itself
has
shown
a
considerable
interest
in
the
apple
business.
some
60
years
ago
washington
was
the
first
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states
to
promulgate
apple
grades,
anticipating
the
federal
grading
system
by
some
15
years,
but
there
are
several
even
more
vital
distinctions
between
the
two
grading
systems.
the
federal
system
is
optional
only.
the
apple
packer
may
choose
to
use
it
or
to
ignore
it
without
penalty.
the
washington
state
system
on
the
other
hand
is
mandatory.
no
apples
maybe
packed
or
shipped
in
or
from
the
state
of
washington
unless
they
have
been
graded
and
unless
the
grade
is
marked
on
the
container.
the
federal
grading
system
permits
and
packer
himself
to
grade
his
own
apples,
subject
only
to
someone’s
later
challenge.
the
washington
state
system
on
the
other
hand
mandates
grading
by
independently
employed
inspectors.
in
summary,
the
federal
system
requires
neither
grading
nor
inspection.
the
washington
state
system
requires
both.
the
us
department
of
agriculture
therefore
has
explicitly
declined
to
preempt
the
field
of
apple
grading
or
inspection
and
no
issue
of
preemption
is
involved
in
this
case
whatsoever.
while
some
36
states,
not
13
mr.
justice
stewart,
grow
apples
in
commercial
quantities,
30%
of
all
of
the
apples
grown
in
the
united
states
are
grown
in
washington
and
the
50%
of
all
fresh
apples
sold
in
interstate
commerce
in
closed
containers
originate
in
the
state
of
washington,
in
fact,
on
one
relatively
small
portion
of
the
state,
on
the
east
slope
of
the
cascade
mountains.
as
a
result
of
this
combination
of
facts,
a
number
of
developments
in
the
apple
business
were
either
illogical
or
almost
inevitable
or
both.
in
our
state
one
such
development
was
a
detailed
and
careful
state
regulation
of
the
apple
business
to
ensure
the
quality
and
the
reputation
of
washington
apples.
that
regulation
includes
our
mandatory
grading
and
inspection
system
and
a
state
grading
system,
which
is
more
rigorous
with
the
top
washington
grades,
extra
fancy
and
fancy,
deny
the
comparable
voluntary
federal
grades.
in
addition,
washington
is
the
only
state
in
which
there
is
extensive
use
of
what
is
called
the
controlled
atmosphere
storage,
the
system
permitting
a
year
round
supply
of
fresh
apples
from
one
harvest
to
the
next.
obviously
such
a
regulatory
system
assures
quality
at
a
relatively
high
price
to
which
is
added
the
punishingly
high
costs
of
transportation
to
markets
thousands
of
miles
away.
nevertheless
washington
apples
compete
successfully
with
the
local
product
even
in
the
east
and
in
the
south.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
competition
is
too
intense
for
the
taste
of
the
apple
growers
of
north
carolina
and
that
is
really
why
we
are
here
today.
mr.
slade
gorton
in
1973,
the
north
carolina
legislature
not
only
banned
but
made
criminal
the
use
of
grades
other
than
u.s.
grades
on
closed
containers
of
apples
shipped
to
or
sold
in
that
state.
a
year
later,
on
our
protest,
the
north
carolina
commissioner
of
agriculture
wrote
us
and
said,
“i
naturally
want
to
have
the
sentiment
from
our
apple
producers
on
the
change
in
the
law
since
they
were
mainly
responsible
for
this
legislation
being
passed.”
quite
obviously
we
obtained
no
relief.
now,
the
north
carolina
statute
contains
a
number
of
interesting
and
relevant
features.
first,
the
statute
does
not
require
any
apples
shipped
to
or
sold
in
the
state
to
be
either
graded
or
inspected
at
all.
second,
the
statute
does
not
apply
to
any
fruit
product
other
than
apples,
though
many
other
fruits
are
the
subject
to
state
grading
systems.
third,
state
grades
may
continue
to
be
used
on
open
containers
of
apples.
the
washington
apples,
by
virtue
of
their
storage
and
the
distance
from
which
they
come,
are
all
shipped
to
north
carolina
in
closed
containers,
but
mr.
justice
stewart
we
have
made
a
misstatement
on
pages
16
and
17
of
our
brief,
in
stating
that
all
north
carolina
apples
are
sold
in
open
containers.
mr.
slade
gorton
some
are
and
some
are
not
and
fourth,
state
grades
may
not
be
used
on
closed
containers
of
apples
in
north
carolina
even
though
the
u.s.
grade
is
also
shown.
thus,
all
washington
apples
sold
in
north
carolina
will
be
graded;
other
apples
may
not
be
graded
at
all.
the
north
carolina
statute
has
substantially
disrupted
the
washington
apple
business.
for
some
time
most
washington
apple
containers
have
been
preprinted
with
the
prominent
display
of
grade
in
order
to
facilitate
not
only
there
handling
and
storage
but
their
sale
as
well.
now,
washington
producers
have
four
choices,
all
unpleasant:
first,
a
manual
obliteration
of
the
washington
grade
from
each
container
which
might
possibly
be
shipped
to
north
carolina,
a
mutilation
which
detracts
from
its
appearance
and
raises
questions
about
the
quality
of
the
contents
to
all
who
see
it,
and
this
at
a
cost
between
five
and
15
cents
a
box
or
as
much
as
$72,000
a
year
for
boxes
bound
to
north
carolina
alone.
now,
while
the
north
carolina
trade
takes
only
1%
of
the
washington
apple
crop
that
involves
some
$2
million
worth
of
apples
and
our
shippers
simply
cannot
determine
in
advance
which
1%
will
eventually
go
to
that
state.
so
their
second
alternative
is
to
eliminate
preprinted
boxes
entirely
and
hand
stamp
manually
the
grade
on
each
box,
as
it
is
utilized
at
an
obvious
increase
in
cost.
thirdly,
of
course,
they
can
abandon
the
north
carolina
market,
or
fourth
they
can
abandon
that
historic
grading
system.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
vast
majority
of
the
boxes.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
would
number
in
the
millions
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
slade
gorton
no
probably
one
year
supply
at
the
time.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
believe
that
--
oh
the
cost
is
not
in
dispute
your
honor,
the
cost
was
found
by
the
district
court.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
total
cost
of
this,
the
(inaudible)
change.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
is
five
to
15
cents
a
box
or
between
$23,000
and
$72,000.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
mr.
slade
gorton
well,
presumably
that
would
be
1%
of
all
of
the
boxes
utilized
in
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
is
a
tremendous
amount.
that
1%
is
$2
million
worth
of
apples.
mr.
slade
gorton
that
is
correct.
mr.
slade
gorton
we
would
like
to
be
able
to
advertise
more
but
this
mutilation
or
a
lot
of
the
boxes
is
at
a
tangible
--
mr.
slade
gorton
yes
it
would.
if
we
stop
printing
them
and
continue
to
use
--
mr.
slade
gorton
the
problem
with
that
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that
we
do
not
know
which
1%
are
going
to
go
to
north
carolina,
even
at
the
time
at
which
they
are
shipped,
when
we
have
sold,
say,
to
the
safe
way
chain
and
its
headquarters
here
in
washington,
dc
which
covers
north
carolina
and
a
number
of
other
states
as
well,
or
when
we
ship
to
an
apple
broker
in
augusta,
georgia
as
we
have
customers
in
several
states.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
1%
is
a
firm
figure
but
we
cannot
determine
which
1%
of
our
apples
will
go
to
the
state
of
north
carolina.
we
can,
of
course,
as
north
carolina
would
like
us
to
do
abandon
this
historic
grading
system
which
has
wider
trade
acceptance.
incidentally
the
--
mr.
slade
gorton
they
seem
to
be
and
they
may
affect
us
by
this
case.
in
any
event
the
affidavits
which
are
found
in
the
appendix
to
this
case
which
talk
of
confusion
are
all
from
people
in
the
apple
growing
or
selling
business
in
north
carolina
who
do
not
deal
in
out-of-state
apples
at
all.
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
record
from
those
who
do
deal
in
out-of-state
apples
even
in
north
carolina
want
to
be
able
to
use
and
they
have
the
washington
state
grade.
so,
the
effect
of
this
system
has
been
added
cost
to
washington
sellers
and
the
north
carolina
consumers,
because
of
this
cost
some
refusals
by
washington
apple
producers
to
sell
to
north
carolina
buyers
and
some
refusals
--
and
this
is
in
the
record
and
undisputed
--
by
north
carolina
purchasers
to
purchase
washington
apples.
the
commission
itself
has
been
frustrated
in
its
duty
to
enhance
the
market
for
washington
apples
and
in
an
advertising
program
which
since
it
obviously
can
not
emphasize
price
leads
to
speak
to
the
quality
of
the
apples
concerned.
but,
north
carolina
consumer
who
must
pay
more
receives
less
because
of
practical
washington
packer
who
can
not
use
the
higher
state
grade
is
likely
to
shift
apples
to
north
carolina
which
meet
only
the
u.s.
grade.
the
north
carolina
wholesaler
or
retailer,
who
wants
the
highest
grade
of
washington
apples,
is
now
denied
to
this
grade
information
at
least
as
a
representation
on
the
container
in
which
the
apples
receive,
and
it
makes
it
more
difficult
for
him
to
get
what
he
wants.
the
only
economic
group
which
gains
is
the
north
carolina
grower,
who
spawned
the
statute
in
the
first
place
and
he
gains
by
lessening
his
competition.
=
this
court
has
consistently
ruled
that
while
a
state
may
regulate
commerce
to
protect
the
health
or
safety
or
its
citizens
from
fraud
even
though
there
maybe
some
effect
under
the
state
commerce,
it
has
a
lack
of
power
to
retire
the
burden
or
constrict
the
flow
of
commerce
simply
for
the
economic
advantage
of
the
people
within
the
state.
the
court
has
been
particularly
careful
in
scrutinizing
restrictions
placed
on
imported
food
products
which
compete
with
those
produced
locally,
in
validating
a
whole
series
of
such
restrictions
on
commerce
in
meek
and
milk
cases.
it
permits
state
restrictions
under
the
state
commerce
only
when
the
state’s
interest
in
its
citizen’s
health
or
safety
or
the
prevention
of
fraud
or
usurpation
outweighs
the
adverse
effect
on
commerce.
it
will
permit
a
producing
state
to
enhance
the
reputation
and
quality
of
its
agricultural
product,
but
not
where
commerce
is
seriously
burdened
simply
into
increased
local
employment
or
only
incidental
lead
to
benefit
its
reputation.
here
we
have
a
regulation,
which
costs
consumer’s
money,
deprives
wholesalers
and
retailers
of
desired
information,
and
all
of
the
people
in
the
business
whose
testimony
is
in
this
record
indicate
that
add
works
to
the
deferment
of
out-of-state
businesses
as
well
as
businesses
in
north
carolina
who
deal
in
apples
at
wholesale
or
retail.
the
regulation
is
unique
as
well
as
dubious
and
it
seems
to
us
falls
within
several
of
your
prohibitions
perhaps
most
particularly
bibb
v.
navajo
freight
lines.
and
a
final
and
added
vies
to
the
north
carolina
scheme
is
that
it
establishes
no
standard
for
apples
at
all.
it
simply
prevents
the
use
of
someone
else’s
standards.
now,
north
carolina
asserts
that
the
commission
lacks
standing
to
challenge
its
statute
either
on
its
own
behalf
or
as
a
representative
of
washington
apple
producers.
you
have
most
clearly
set
these
requirements
out
in
warth
v.
seldin
and
just
a
month
ago
in
boston
stock
exchange
v.
state
tax
commission,
as
follows:
the
association
may
have
standing
in
its
own
right
to
seek
judicial
relief
from
injury
to
itself
and
to
vindicate
whatever
rights
and
immunities
the
association
itself
may
enjoy.
even
in
the
absence
of
injury
to
itself,
when
association
may
have
standing
solely
as
the
representative
of
its
members.
the
association
must
allege
that
its
members
or
any
of
them
or
any
one
of
them
are
suffering
immediate
of
threatened
injury
as
a
result
of
the
challenged
action
of
the
sort
that
would
make
out
a
justiciable
case
had
the
members
themselves
brought
suit.
but
even
apart
from
this,
whether
an
association
has
standing
to
invoke
the
court’s
remedial
powers
on
behalf
of
its
members,
depends
on
substantial
measure
on
the
nature
of
the
relief
sought.
if
in
a
proper
case
the
association
seeks
a
declaration,
injunction,
or
some
other
form
of
prospective
relief,
this
is
exactly
what
we
sought.
it
can
reasonably
be
supposed
that
the
remedy,
if
granted,
will
inherit
of
the
benefit
of
those
members
of
the
association
actually
injured.
now,
the
commission
in
the
state
of
washington
was
created
to
engage
in
research
for
the
use
and
improvement
of
apples,
to
advertise
for
those
apples,
to
educate
the
public
about
its
grades
and
to
stabilize
and
protect
the
apple
industry
of
the
state
of
washington
and
to
expand
its
markets.
mr.
slade
gorton
and
that
was
done
by
the
state
legislature,
explicitly
by
statute.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
is.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
think
that
the
apple
growers
and
for
that
matter,
the
packers
of
the
state
of
washington
are
not
described
as
members
of
the
association,
as
members
in
the
statute.
they
have
all
of
the
indicia
have
membership
power
mr.
justice
stewart,
they
vote
and
they
vote
only
--
mr.
slade
gorton
there
is
more
to
it
than
that.
these
people,
as
union
members
do,
vote
for
their
governing
body
which
set
all
of
the
policies
of
the
commission.
they
also
vote
on
any
increase
in
the
assessments.
the
commission
may
not
of
itself
increase
the
assessment
which
it
uses
to
promote.
mr.
slade
gorton
that
is
an
interesting
question;
it
is
not
briefed
by
either
side.
mr.
slade
gorton
but
we
are
the
state
--
mr.
slade
gorton
the
hawaii
case
indicates
that
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
or
the
state
itself
does
not
have
antitrust
standing
to
sue
for
general
damages
to
the
citizens
of
his
state.
in
this
case
however,
the
commission,
though
it
is
created
by
the
state
statute
--
mr.
slade
gorton
--
and
is
a
state
agency,
is
given
a
very
specific
grant
of
authority
and
a
very
specific
limit
which
grant
of
authority
includes
the
right
to
sue
and
to
be
sued
in
its
own
name.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
think
we
would
have
a
somewhat
--
considerably
--
mr.
slade
gorton
amorphous
situation,
because
that
department
of
commerce
would
not
directly
represent
these
growers
of
a
specific
commodity.
the
difference
between
the
department
of
commerce
and
this
situation,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
very
considerable
one.
the
difference
between
a
group,
engaged
in
a
single
business
which
controls
the
conduct
of
that
business,
the
chief
justice
asked
whether
or
not
this
is
not
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
trade
association,
and
of
course
it
is.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
charge
--
but
the
statute
sets
out
the
duties
of
this
commission
as
being
identical
to
those
of
any
normal
trade
association.
mr.
slade
gorton
pardon.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
do
not,
but
at
by
the
same
--
mr.
slade
gorton
many
apple
commissions
in
other
states
or
agriculture
commissions
in
other
states
are
represented
by
private
counsel
who
may
chose
themselves;
a
majority
of
such
state
agencies
as
here.
mr.
slade
gorton
there
is
no
question
about
the
state
agency.
it
does
not
seem
--
mr.
slade
gorton
i
was
just
trying
to
answer
that
question
in
advance
mr.
justice
marshall.
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
state
agency
of
this
nature
and
an
association.
there
is
no
reason
why
in
law
as
it
is
in
fact
an
agency
may
not
at
the
same
time,
be
an
agency,
a
state
agency
and
an
association
of
the
type
which
you
have
clearly
given
authority
to
bring
lawsuits
on
behalf
of
its
members.
we
have
the
functional
equivalent
of
that
however.
mr.
slade
gorton
there
is
no
question
about
the
fact
that
we
are
the
state,
i
think
that
the
question
as
far
as,
one
question
as
far
as
our
standing
here
is
concerned,
however,
out
of
two
is
whether
or
not
in
addition
to
being
a
state
unlike
a
general
agency
of
the
state
we
are
not
also
for
the
purposes
of
the
law
and
association
entitled
to
represent
our
membership
which
directly
sets
our
policy.
mr.
slade
gorton
our
growers,
those
people
who
pay
for
the
--
mr.
slade
gorton
in
addition
of
course
we
have
our
own
interests
as
a
state
and
as
an
agency
of
the
state
--
mr.
slade
gorton
oh
no,
not
a
parents
patria
interest.
the
interest
of
the
commission
both,
in
promoting
and
enhancing
its
market
and
specifically
in
its
advertising
budget,
is
a
direct
interest
in
which
it
can
sue
on
its
own
behalf
even
if
it
were
not
and
even
if
it
is
not
deemed
to
be
in
association
entitled
to
sue
on
its
own.
mr.
slade
gorton
precisely.
mr.
slade
gorton
we
have
alleged
that
we
have
lost
business
in
north
carolina
by
reason
of
this
statute
and
we
have
proved
it.
we
have
not
--
mr.
slade
gorton
exactly,
if
the
apples
go
elsewhere
the
budget
would
be
the
same
and
to
be
perfectly
honest
with
you,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
in
market
for
apples
in
recent
years
for
all
practical
purposes
all
of
the
apples
have
been
sold.
we
are
however
effectively
denied,
at
least
in
part,
a
significant
portion
of
our
market
which
would
adversely
affect
our
sales.
mr.
slade
gorton
in
this
case
it
would
be
either
the
apple
commission
as
such
which
the
income
of
which
it
is
dependent
to
the
farming
or
purchasing
of
apples.
mr.
slade
gorton
we
have
income
which
comes
from
assessments
from
the
growers
which
we
expend
on
a
number
of
activities,
one
of
which
is
advertising.
mr.
slade
gorton
but
that
income
could
easily
be
affected
by
this
kind
of
restrictions.
certainly
--
mr.
slade
gorton
--
the
income
generated
from
sales
to
north
carolina
by
washington
apple
growers
has
been
affected.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
but
they
are
the
source
of
the
income
of
the
commission
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
slade
gorton
by
assessment
which
assessment
is
based
on
production
and
on
shipment.
mr.
slade
gorton
pardon.
mr.
slade
gorton
well,
the
actual
production
of
apples
has
increased
over
the
last
few
years
but
the
portions
of
that
assessment
which
--
mr.
slade
gorton
the
party
has
lost
the
effectiveness
of
its
advertising.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
is
effected
to
the
amount
of
$25,000
which
is
its
advertising
budget
in
north
carolina.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
considers
the
value
of
the
right
to
advertise
in
north
carolina
to
be
worth
at
least
the
$25,000
which
it
expends
there.
it
does
not
stop
our
advertising
but
it
makes
our
advertising
far
or
less
effective,
i
think
by
the
amount
we
use
for
advertising
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
in
a
given
year,
which
is
$25,000.
we
have
alleged
of
course
and
the
court
below
did
not
get
to
the
question
of
our
first
amendment
rights
to
advertise
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
in
that
case
we
in
all
probably
do
not
need
a
minimum
jurisdictional
amount
but
the
commission
has
considered
the
right
to
advertise
in
north
carolina
to
a
bit
worth
an
expenditure
of
something
over
$25,000
a
year.
at
this
point,
we
are
denied
the
right
to
use
what
we
can,
what
the
commission
considers
to
be
its
most
significant
method
of
advertising
in
the
state
of
north
carolina,
i.e.,
the
use
of
its
grades
--
mr.
slade
gorton
no
we
did
not.
there
is
--
mr.
slade
gorton
to
sue
on
the
name
of
the
commission,
and
this
action
is
brought
on
the
name
of
the
commission.
mr.
slade
gorton
we
have
no
original
jurisdiction
in
this
court
your
honor.
the
right
to
sue
and
to
be
sued
is
only
on
the
name
of
the
commission
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
statute
specifically
exempts
the
state
other
than
the
income
of
the
commission
itself
from
any
adverse
judgment.
the
general
credit
of
the
state
is
not
involved
in
any
suit
for
monetary
damages.
mr.
slade
gorton
they
are
associated
together
by
law
and
the
fact
that
they
are
mandated
to
engage
in
such
an
association
makes
them
no
different
in
the
analogy
which
you
have
made
earlier
of
membership
in
a
labor
union
which
has
a
close
shop
agreement
with
a
particular
employer.
that
membership
is
mandated
of
course
as
a
condition
of
having
a
job
and
just
as
here,
in
order
to
grow
or
to
ship
apples
in
the
state
or
to
produce
apples
commercially
in
the
state
of
washington
(voice
overlap)
under
the
law.
mr.
slade
gorton
in
the
government
all
citizens
who
are
--
mr.
slade
gorton
all
taxpayers
or
all
citizens
at
least
are
so
associated.
it
seems
to
me
however
that
the
thrust
of
your
concern
with
the
right
of
an
association
to
sue
for
its
members
is
based
not
on
whether
that
association
is
created
by
statute
or
created
voluntarily,
whether
or
not
its
membership
is
free
to
join
or
not
to
join,
but
by
whether
or
not
the
representative
will
in
fact
preferably
represent
the
interest
of
its
members,
whether
or
not
a
judgment
entered
on
behalf
of
or
against
the
so-called
association,
will
bind
or
will
affect
if
the
judgment
is
what
they
seek
will
affect
affirmatively
the
members
of
the
association.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
simply
cannot
answer
that.
i
suspect
that
well
we
have
many
growers;
there
are
almost
6,000
growers
in
the
state
we
have
only
someone
120
packers
and
shippers
and
it
is
very,
very
possible
that
a
given
packer
or
shipper
might
have
that
amount
involved
in
sales
to
the
state
of
north
carolina
when
you
reflect
there
are
$2
million
for
the
sales
--
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
there
is
nothing
in
the
records
to
indicate
that.
your
right
thought
as
to
growers
mr.
justice
marshall,
probably
we
would
have
that
amount
as
to
a
shipper.
in
summary,
it
seems,
both
from
your
questions
and
from
the
argument
of
the
opposing
counsel,
there
is
little
question
here
as
to
the
interference
in
commerce
of
the
particular
proposal
of
a
particular
statute
which
the
state
of
north
carolina
has
passed.
it
quite
obviously
falls
within
the
consistence
ban
the
state
has
had
and
this
court
has
placed
on
in
the
state
producers
affecting
commerce
simply
for
the
benefit
of
those
producers,
even
though
they
set
forth
some
kind
of
guides
of
the
protection
of
the
consumer
or
the
health
and
safety
of
the
people
of
the
state.
the
problem
of
standing
can
be
resolved
either
by
treating
the
washington
state
apple
advertising
commission
itself
as
the
sole
party
in
an
unrepresentative
nature
in
the
state
but
permitting
it
to
deal
with
the
losses,
to
the
business
in
which
it
is
solely
engaged
or
by
reason
of
its
own
advertising
budget
in
the
state
of
north
carolina.
alternatively,
it
can
be
treated
appropriately
as
an
association
since
a
decision
here
would
affect
all
of
the
growers
and
all
of
the
shippers
in
the
state
of
washington.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
