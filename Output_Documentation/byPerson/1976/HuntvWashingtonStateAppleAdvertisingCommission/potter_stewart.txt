some
are
and
some
are
not.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
done
by
the
state
legislature.
justice
potter
stewart
right,
the
commission
represented
by
you
as
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
is
part
of
the
government
of
the
state
of
washington,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it
is
not
an
association
and
it
does
not
have
members,
am
i
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
taxpayers
have
all
the
indicia
of
members
in
the
state
government,
i
suppose
too
by
that,
they
vote
and
they
pay
dues.
justice
potter
stewart
but,
to
come
back
you
are
--this
is
the
part
of
the
government
of
the
state
represented
by
you
as
attorney
general
of
the
state
and
whether
or
not
you
have
standing
depends
then
ultimately
upon
whether
or
not
the
state
has
standing
as
parents
patria,
doesn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
ultimate
question,
isn't
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
are
many
cases
holding
that
the
state
does
not
have
standing
as
parents
patria,
are
they
not
at
least
in
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court
and
not
in
the
antitrust
fields
hawaii
against
standard
oil.
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
a
state
agency.
justice
potter
stewart
when
we
say
the
state
of
washington
had
a
department
of
commerce
that
had
the
same
statutory
right
to
sue
or
be
sued
in
its
function
as
to
represent
the
business
interest
of
your
state,
you
would
have
the
same
situation,
wouldn’t
you?
justice
potter
stewart
constitutionally
it
would
be
the
same
thing,
it
will
be
the
state.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
answer
by
your
opponent
was
no,
it
is
not.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
who
is
we
and
who
is
ours,
there
is
a
single
plaintiff
there?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
do
not
make
any
sales,
you
do
not
have
any
income
except
the
assessments
made
on
the
growers.
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
sales
have
not
been
affected,
the
commission’s
the
agency’s
sales
have
not
been
affected
because
it
does
not
make
any
sales,
its
income
has
not
been
affected
because
its
income
is
the
assessments
made
on
the
washington
growers,
so
that
my
question
was
who
we,
who
has
been
(inaudible)
the
sales
income.
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
not
been
though.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
washington
apple
growers
are
not,
either
as
a
group
or
individually,
are
not
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
by
assessment?
