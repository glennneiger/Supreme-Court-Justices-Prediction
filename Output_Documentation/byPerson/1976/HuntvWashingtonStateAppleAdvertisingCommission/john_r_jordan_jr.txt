mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
1971,
state
of
north
carolina
enacted
a
general
statute
requiring
that
no
grade
other
than
applicable
u.s.
grade
to
be
shown
on
closed
containers
of
apples
sold
of
offered
to
sale
in
north
carolina.
in
1973,
the
statute
was
amended
to
include
the
words
or
shipped,
an
amendment
which
was
probably
not
necessary
but
to
make
a
material
amendment
making
the
u.s.
grade
the
exclusive
grade
marking
on
closed
containers.
the
statute
has,
at
all
times
both
in
1971
and
in
1973,
applied
to
apples
grown
within
north
carolina
as
well
as
apples
grown
elsewhere
and
furthermore
there
has
never
at
any
time
in
any
prohibition
on
the
labeling
of
apple
containers
so
as
to
state
that
they
were
grown
in
washington
or
in
any
other
jurisdiction.
may
we
quickly
explain
that
apples
are
graded
by
the
use
of
terms
of
its
extra
fancy,
fancy,
number
one
and
so
forth.
these
grades
can
be
arbitrarily
changed
from
year
to
year
by
various
agencies
of
the
13
commercial
apple
growing
states.
apparently
this
is
sometimes
done
to
create
a
market
for
a
particular
quality
of
apple.
indeed
the
washington
state
direct
their
marketing
as
this
power
and
has
changed
the
washington
state
grades
since
this
controversy
begin.
thus,
what
was
a
fancy
apple
last
year
may
not
be
this
year,
although
the
name
is
the
same.
the
general
assembly
of
north
carolina
exercised
the
police
power
of
the
state
to
prevent
confusion
in
the
wholesale
marketplace
where
apples
are
sold
in
closed
containers
and
not
available
for
a
ready
viewing
by
a
professional
apple
purchaser.
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
not
necessarily,
sir.
i
believe
that
the
practice
in
north
carolina
is
the
same
as
the
practice
in
washington,
some
are
sold
in
closed
containers
intrastate
and
some
are
not.
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
now,
by
use
of
the
u.s.
grade
only
there
can
be
no
arbitrarily
manipulation
of
labels
between
fancy
and
extra
fancy
whether
by
north
carolina
or
by
any
other
jurisdiction.
the
federal
grades
are
the
only
uniform
and
consistent
grades.
the
washington
state
apple
advertising
commission
filed
a
suit
for
declaratory
judgment
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
prayed
that
enforcement
be
permanently
enjoined.
a
three-judge
district
court
sitting
in
north
carolina
held
that
the
statute
contravene
the
commerce
clause
and
enjoined
its
enforcement
insofar
as
it
precluded
the
display
of
the
washington
state
grade
on
the
containers,
but
it
did
not
strike
down
the
requirement
of
the
north
carolina
statute
that
the
u.s.
grades
must
be
shown,
and
the
court
will
recall,
as
i
indicated
the
moment
ago,
that
that
goes
all
away
back
to
the
1971
enactment,
the
original
enactment
rather
general
assembly.
three
questions
are
presented
by
the
appeal.
they
are
the
standing
of
washington
state
commission
to
bring
this
action,
the
jurisdictional
amount,
and
the
district
court’s
determination
that
the
north
carolina
statute
contravenes
the
commerce
clause.
may
it
please
the
court,
we
would
like
to
briefly
address
each
of
those
and
first
to
address
the
threshold
questions
of
standing
and
the
jurisdictional
amount
requirement.
we
will
respectfully
submit
that
the
advertising
commission’s
pleadings
do
not
contain
the
necessary
allegations
of
injury
in
fact
to
an
established
standard.
rather
the
complaint
alleges
and
injury
to
individuals
who
are
not
parties
to
this
action.
i
will
come
to
the
action
in
a
representative
capacity
in
a
moment.
at
this
time,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
am
talking
about
an
action
by
the
commission
for
itself.
now,
the
claim
is
an
advertising
activity.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
there
is
a
self-serving
portion
of
the
statute
creating
the
advertising
commission,
and
it
is
said
out
in
the
opinions,
elaborately
stating
that
it
was
enacted
within
the
police
power
of
the
state
of
washington,
the
very
thing
which
is
before
us
ultimately
under
the
commerce
clause
when
we
test
a
north
carolina
statute.
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
no
sir,
we
respectfully
disagree.
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
may
it
please
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
district
court
misread
the
warth
case
and
others
because,
there
we
were
referring
to
associations.
this
is
not
an
association.
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
that
is
exactly
what
it
is,
may
it
please
the
court.
not
a
single
grower
in
the
state
of
washington
has
any
option
about
this
matter
whatsoever.
he
is
assessed
and
he
pays
and
the
commission
then
spends
his
money
to
advertise
his
apples.
he
cannot
refuse
to
join,
may
it
please
your
honor.
he
is
an
individual
who
pays
the
commission
to
do
this
but
there
is
nothing
which
disqualifies
him,
if
he
is
injured
by
the
north
carolina
statute
from
bringing
an
action.
certainly
if
his
injury
exceeds
$10,000,
he
could
bring
it
in
the
federal
court,
if
it
does
not,
he
could
bring
it
in
the
state
court.
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
your
honor,
i
would
say
it
does
not.
its
principal
function
is
advertising
and
if
you
would
look
at
the
complaint,
even
in
its
amended
form
with
the
second
bite
at
the
cherry.
all
that
washington
state
contends
that
the
washington
state
advertising
commission
does
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
is
advertising.
they
say
we
spend
$25,000
in
advertising.
well
there
is
nothing
in
the
north
carolina
statute
which
says
you
cannot
advertise.
every
carton
coming
into
north
carolina
can
display
in
the
largest
possible
word
it,
“washington
state
apples”,
and
indeed
at
hearings
before
the
north
carolina
advertising
commission,
we
showed
that,
that
was
being
done
and
we
have
no
objection
to
it.
we
welcome
that
advertising
that
they
were
grown
in
washington.
what
we
are
saying
through
is
to
put
the
washington
state
grade
on
the
carton,
on
their
closed
containers
is
offensive
to
the
north
carolina
statute
because
within
the
police
power
the
general
assembly
of
north
carolina
found
that
there
was
confusion
in
the
marketplace.
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
your
honor,
i
am.
i
am
getting
ahead,
if
i
may
return
to
my
notes.
the
linda
case
in
1973
which
is
cited
to
this
court
so
often,
reaffirmed
the
requirement
that
a
party
seeking
review
must
itself
have
suffered
an
injury
and
when
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
is
attacked,
then
the
party
invoking
jurisdictional
power
must
show
that
it
has
sustained
direct
injury
as
a
result
of
the
statute
enforcement.
there,
both
the
sierra
club
case
and
the
warth
case
say
that
it
must
appear
in
the
complaint.
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
there
we
run
into
a
question,
of
course,
of
commercial
freedom
of
speech
which
we
do
not
think
is
relevant
in
this
case
because
we
do
not
say
that
you
do
not
--
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
that
plaintiff
would
have
standing.
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
i
think
i
would
follow
your
honor’s
thinking
in
that,
and
that
judge
dupree
(ph)
sitting
alone
and
passing
on
the
jurisdictional
questions
that
on
our
own
request.
we
filed
a
letter
with
him,
asking
him
if
he
would
do
that
sitting
alone
before
the
three-judge
panel
was
convened,
judge
dupree
referred
to
commercial
advertising
in
saying
that
the
commission
had
this
right
to
advertise,
but
of
course,
looking
again
to
the
two
recent
virginia
cases
before
this
court
on
commercial
advertising,
they
do
not
say
that
you
can’t
regulate.
here,
all
we
are
saying
is
that
you
may
advertise
where
your
apples
came
from,
but
you
can’t
confuse
the
wholesaler
or
purchaser
by
having
multiple
grades.
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
only
to
this
extent
that
if
other
advertising
is
permitted
then
the
degree
of
advertising
which
is
the
degree
test
which
is
applied
to
commercial
advertising
under
that
first
amendment
is
met.
as
we
say,
they
can
put
any
kind
of
identification
in
the
world.
this
is
definitely,
if
please
the
court,
from
the
arizona
case
in
which
the
court
held
that
arizona
could
not
require
that
the
name
“arizona
produced”
appear
on
the
cantaloupe
carton.
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
may
it
please
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
directed
us
or
rather
the
three-judge
district
court
directed
us
to
go
directly
into
the
arguments
on
the
merits
stating
that
it
was
accepting
the
memorandum
and
order
of
judge
dupree
who
heard
it
alone.
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
it
was
not
discussed
before
the
three-judge
panel,
yes.
now,
i
would
like
to
move
very
quickly
to
whoever
the
commission
may
bring
it
in
a
representative
capacity
because
obviously
that
is
the
next
hurdle
that
we
must
cross.
now,
we
say,
it
cannot,
as
i
have
indicated
a
moment
ago
to
the
chief
justice,
because
this
is
not
an
association
within
the
sense
of
a
single
association
case
that
has
been
before
this
court,
not
one
that
we
can
find,
and
i
hope
i
am
not
mistaking
the
situation.
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
look
still
to
the
nature
of
the
organization,
and
when
we
look
at
the
nature
of
this
organization
as
set
forth
in
the
appendix
we
seek
what
its
function
really
is,
and
that
is
to
access
the
apple
growers
and
obtain
moneys
to
advertise
apple,
and
to
do
research
into
improving
the
growing
of
the
apples
in
the
state
of
washington
which
is
admittedly
a
major
crop
there.
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
trade
associations,
may
it
please
your
honor,
first
and
i
think
the
distinguishing
characteristic
is
trade
associations
are
voluntary
organizations
which
--
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
yes
it
is
your
honor,
but
we
think
it
--
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
because
there
is
no
option
on
the
part
of
the
members
in
a
controversies
of
this
kind
where
there
is
no
option
on
the
part
of
the
members
as
to
whether
they
wish
to
participate
or
not.
there
is
an
option
certain
as
to
whether
person
wants
to
belong
to
a
union
or
not.
here,
if
you
are
go
be
an
apple
grower
in
the
state
of
washington
you
are
going
to
belong
that
this
advertising
agency
whether
you
want
to
or
not.
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
this
advertising
commission
has
representative
from
the
growing
and
warehousing
segments
of
the
apple
industry
in
the
state
of
washington,
may
i
please
the
court,
and
they
are
elected
by
the
districts
according
to
the
washington
statute
as
it
appears
in
the
appendix.
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
that
is
right.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
perhaps
so
your
honor,
but
we
also
think
there
is
another
distinction
here
and
that
is
one
which
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
other
cases
that
is
no
disability
on
a
single
one
of
these
growers
from
bringing
an
action
if
indeed
it
is
injured.
now,
i
know
there
is
affidavit
in
here
and
this
brings
the
warth
case.
there
is
an
affidavit
in
here
in
which
the
director
of
marketing
of
apples
of
the
state
of
washington
says
that
he
owns
an
orchard,
but
it
is
significant
that
he
never
says
he
has
been
injured
whatsoever
by
the
north
carolina
statute.
surely,
if
he
had
been
injured
he
would
have
said
so.
in
the
warth
case
the
opinion
points
out
that
there
was
one
member
of
the
council
who
actually
pleaded
that
he
had
been
injured.
but
still
this
court
said
one
is
not
enough
to
make
the
council
the
proper
party
in
that
case.
the
court
did
not
go
along
with
the
court
below.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
because
it
is
very
important
part
of
this
case,
mr.
bramley’s
(ph)
affidavit
on
pages
103,
107
of
the
appendix
inadvertently
misstates
the
genesis
of
the
north
carolina
law.
now,
actually
it
was
passed
in
1971,
two
years
before
this
controversy
began,
not
in
response
to
the
appearance
of
the
washington
state
apple
advertising
commission
before
the
north
carolina
board
of
agriculture.
it
was
in
1973
that
the
change
was
made
because
of
the
constant
and
persistent
refusal
of
the
state
of
washington
to
obey
the
law.
every
other
apple
growing
state
shipping
into
north
carolina
was
obeying
the
law.
then,
so
the
1973
session
of
the
state
added
the
words
that
it
would
be
the
exclusive
marking
whether
they
were
north
carolina
apples,
washington
apples,
virginia
apples
and
of
course,
we
have
no
greater
competitor
in
north
carolina
than
these
delicious
virginia
apples.
but
north
carolina
did
not
change
the
rules
after
the
controversy
began.
no,
indeed,
but
washington
did.
it
went
in
and
changed
its
grades
and
up
them
to
the
equivalent
unites
states
grades.
now,
the
harsh
fact
is
that
should
they
prevail
here
today,
they
can
go
back
to
washington
and
change
those,
lower
those
grades,
change
them
back
to
what
they
were
before.
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
yes.
i
would
like
to
talk
just
a
word
on
jurisdictional
on
that.
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
no
sir,
i
don’t,
i
have
not
covered
it
any
of
our
briefs
either
presently.
on
jurisdictional
amount
the
only
specific
allegation
in
the
complaint,
and
again,
i
refer
to
the
insistence
of
this
court
that
this
would
be
determined
from
the
allegations
in
the
complaint.
this
is
again
in
sierra
club;
this
is
in
warth,
and
the
only
thing
you
find
out
is
the
$25,000
spent
on
behalf
of
the
commission
in
advertising
in
the
state
of
north
carolina.
well,
they
are
welcome
to
continue
to
advertise
in
the
state
of
north
carolina.
there
is
no
prohibition
on
that.
so,
they
have
to
then
go
to
the
question
of
aggregation
of
claims.
we
find
no
case
precisely
in
point
and
that
is
not
surprising
but
there
are
analogous
cases,
the
zahn
case
which
we
cite
involves
four
property
owners
claiming
injury
by
water
pollution
caused
by
paper
company,
and
in
this
court
here
that
claims
could
not
be
aggregated
to
provide
the
$10,000
you
see.
if
that
is
true,
every
single
marketing
association
in
north
carolina
could
have
ten
growers
coming
into
the
federal
courts,
i
say,
in
north
carolina.
in
the
nation
and
there
must
be
tens
of
thousands
of
them
coming
into
the
federal
courts
and
in
saying,
“i
am
injured,
$1,000.”
ten
of
them,
that’s
$10,000.
these
are
matters
which
this
court
has
persistently
said
should
be
treated
in
the
state
court.
there
is
an
interesting
contradiction
in
what
the
district
court
did
in
this
regard.
the
bramley
affidavit,
which
appears
on
page
17
of
the
appendix,
attempts
to
meet
the
jurisdictional
requirement
which
was
not
in
the
complaint.
it
is
just
not
there,
but
they
say
that
the
requirement
--
they
estimate
that
it
costs
from
5
to
15
cents
a
box
to
obliterate
the
washington
state
grade
from
what
they
allege
a
pre-printed
container.
now,
the
evidence
is
in
dispute
on
that.
there
is
an
affidavit
to
the
contrary
there
as
to
whether
they
are
all
pre-printed
or
not.
but
in
any
event
the
district
court
accepted
this
and
mr.
justice
marshall
it
was
referred
to
by
judge
dupree
and
judge
craven
who
wrote
for
the
three-judge
court
specifically
put
it
in
his
footnote
9
in
great
details.
obviously
the
court
felt
that
this
was
the
basis
for
the
jurisdictional
amount,
but
what
did
the
court
do.
the
court
struck
down
the
requirement
which
put
the
washington
growers
to
this
expense
what
left
intact
the
requirement
that
they
show
the
u.s.
grade
that
mathematically
obviously
one
cancels
out
the
other
and
you
are
left
with
a
zero.
now,
our
point
is
that
if
you
cannot
aggregate
there
is
absolutely
no
way
to
reach
the
jurisdictional
point,
the
jurisdictional
amount
in
a
representative
capacity.
may
i
speak
very
quickly
on
the
merits,
i
would
like
to
remind
the
court
that
less
than
1%
of
the
washington
production
is
involved
--
less
than
1%
of
the
washington
apples
shipped
involved
in
this
case,
and
that
must
be
considerably
less
then
1%
of
the
total
production.
now,
that
is
the
backdrop
for
the
exercise
or
the
application
of
the
balancing
theory.
now,
there
was
the
case
in
the
30’s
justice
brandeis
speaking
for
the
court
held
that
if
was
proper
for
oregon
to
request
standard
containers
for
raspberries
and
strawberries.
obviously,
the
state
shippers
were
required
to
go
to
the
expense
of
using
a
different
container
from
that
permitted
by
other
state
than
oregon.
mr.
justice
brandeis
pointed
out,
and
let
me
say
with
candid,
he
distinguished,
he
used
some
language
which
distinguished
that
opinion
from
the
opinion
that
we
seek
in
this
case,
because
he
said
that
the
plaintiff
was
a
manufacturer
of
grapes,
it
was
not
a
grower
nor
produce,
there
is
that
difference.
he
went
on
to
say
that
actually
probably
in
a
state
commerce
is
got
involved
because
the
real
crux
of
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
intrastate.
but
mr.
justice
brandeis
went
on
the
point
at
one
factual
that
comes
home
in
this
case.
he
said
“there
are
34
other
styles
or
shapes
of
berry
baskets
in
use
somewhere
in
the
united
states.
obviously
a
multitude
of
shapes
and
sizes
of
packages
tends
to
confuse
the
buyers.”
and
then
he
specifically
applied
the
police
power
test
to
that
kind
of
factual
situation
and
he
said
the
order
here
in
question
deals
with
a
subject
clearly
within
the
scope
of
the
police
power
when
such
legislative
action
is
called
in
question
if
any
state
of
facts
reasonably
can
be
conceived
that
would
sustain
it
there
is
a
presumption
of
existence
of
that
state
of
facts
and
one
who
assails
in
the
classification
must
carry
the
burden
of
showing
by
resort
the
common
knowledge
or
other
matters
which
may
be
judicially
noticed
or
other
legitimate
proof
that
the
action
is
arbitrate.
this
record
shows
the
country.
this
record
shows
that
since
the
north
carolina
statute
was
passed,
the
qualities
of
apples
coming
into
north
carolina
have
improved.
this
record
shows
that
united
states
department
of
agriculture
conducting
an
independent
survey
of
the
apple
industry
from
one
ocean
to
the
other
found
that
what
north
carolina
had
done
had
had
a
salutary
effect
and
recommended
that
every
apple
growing
state
do
the
same
thing.
the
general
assembly
of
north
carolina
hearing
witnesses
from
the
apple
industry
enacted
the
statute
within
the
exercise
of
its
police
power.
there
is
an
affidavit
in
this
appendix
from
a
gentleman
whose
name,
if
i
recall
is
barba
(ph)
who
has
been
in
the
apple
business
for
50
years.
he
pointed
out
that
the
use
of
multiple
grades
was
not
only
confined
to
what
appears
on
the
container,
on
the
close
container
but
that
apples
are
sold
by
pricelist
which
are
circulated,
i
believe,
by
telegram
or
by
wire
or
electronically
in
some
way,
and
that
when
all
of
these
different
grades
appear
on
that
list,
and
that
when
multiple
grades
and
a
federal
interstate
grade
both
appear
on
that
list,
it
is
confusing
to
the
buyers
and
that
prices
are
depressed
in
this
way.
now,
it
has
been
chosen
that
in
north
carolina
the
grower
that
since
1971
have
been
using
the
united
states
grade
only.
that
has
improved
the
quality
of
domestic
apples.
that
is
in
this
record.
what
it
seeks
to
do
in
that
time,
and
no
other
state
significantly
raises
any
protest.
every
other
apple
growing
state
has
acquiesced
in
what
north
carolina
is
trying
to
do.
it
is
contended
by
a
state
of
washington
that
this
statue
discriminates
in
favor
of
north
carolina
growers.
but
nowhere,
nowhere
in
the
record
or
in
the
brief,
we
have
shown
how
on
earth
does
it
discriminate
in
favor
of
north
carolina
growers.
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
it
uses,
by
statue
--
may
it
please
your
honor,
the
federal
grades
however
the
statue
provides
that
you
need
not
grade
if
you
do
not
wish
to
where
you
use
a
closed
container,
and
of
course
that
also
applies
to
washington
or
any
other
state,
shipping
in
the
north
carolina.
i
believe
the
same
is
true
for
virginia.
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
that
is
true
and
that
seem
to
bother
judge
craven.
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
we
have
this
situation
when
apples
come
in,
in
a
closed
container
--
and
this
has
been
agreed
by
all
parties,
this
was
agreed
in
oral
argument
before
the
three-judge
court
that
we
are
really
talking
about
apple
transactions
at
the
wholesale
level,
where
you
have
got
experts,
men
who
spent
their
lives
like
mr.
barba
(ph)
who
spent
50
years
buying
and
selling
apples.
men
who
look
at
apples
and
determine
visually
what
that
apple
is
worth,
but
when
an
apple
is
sold
in
a
closed
container
whether
it
is
grown
in
washington
or
in
north
carolina
and
when
it
is
bought
or
sold
from
one
of
these
pricelist
which
transferred
either
electronically
or
by
telegram
or
mail,
you
go
back
whether
it
says
it
is
on
fancy,
on
extra
fancy,
on
ordinary,
a
u.s.
or
washington
one
or
what.
but
the
professional
buyer
knows
by
the
grade
that
this
is
going
to
call
for
the
best
price,
this
is
going
to
be
the
best
grade.
if
there
is
no
grade
then
that
is
an
apple
that
is
going
to
be
used
for
applesauce
or
vinegar
or
cider
whatever
the
other
uses
for
apple
are.
this
is
known
within
the
trade,
this
is
trade
custom.
it
is
where
they
are
available
for
visible
determination
that
no
grade
is
really
necessary.
it
is
where
they
are
marked
in
a
closed
container
that
the
buyer
has
to
have
something
to
guide
and
if
there
is
nothing
on
it
whatsoever
then
the
buyer
knows
he
is
not
in
the
fancy,
the
extra
fancy,
the
number
one
category
anyway.
of
course
he
has
a
right
and
it
is
exercised
to
open
that
container
look
at
those
apples
and
give
them
a
manual
visible
inspection.
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
no
it
does
not;
it
just
refers
to
that
presence
on
closed
containers.
i
think
my
time
is
up.
i
would
like
to
sum
up
with
just
one
word.
we
feel
that
ultimately
the
principle
thrust
of
the
apple
commission’s
position
is
that
the
north
carolina
statute
does
not
meet
the
balance
of
interest
test,
that
is,
that
for
a
state
regulation
to
be
constitutional
its
benefits
must
outweigh
the
burden
on
it
and
the
state
commerce.
in
this
context
the
whole
core
of
this
case
can
be
considerably
restricted.
it
boils
down
that
whether
the
desire
of
a
given
state
to
advertise
its
state
grade
on
less
than
1%
of
its
total
volume
of
apple
shipped
outweighs
the
exercise
of
the
police
power
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
through
its
general
assembly,
when
the
records
shows
that
while
the
statute
was
in
effect
the
quality
of
apple
shipped
in
the
north
carolina
improved,
the
confusion
was
eliminated,
and
that
the
state’s
action
received
a
laudatory
recommendation
of
experts
surveying
such
matters
for
the
us
department
of
agriculture.
when
the
balancing
test
is
applied
to
these
facts
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
action
of
the
general
assembly
should
prevail.
i
thank
you
so
much.
mr.
john
r.
jordan,
jr.
thank
you
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
no
rebuttal.
