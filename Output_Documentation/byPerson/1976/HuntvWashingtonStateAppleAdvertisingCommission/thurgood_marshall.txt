i
understand
from
mr.
jordon
that
all
this
is
in
dispute,
did
they
agree
that
you
have
all
of
these
--
well
how
many
do
you
have
printed
already?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean
do
you
print
them
up
for
10
years?
justice
thurgood
marshall
probably
does
not
help
me.
i
want
to
know
just
how
much
it
does
cost.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
total
cost?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
how
much?
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
total?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
out
of
how
much?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
1%
is
very
heavy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
spend
$25,000
in
advertising
in
north
carolina.
justice
thurgood
marshall
any
trouble
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
talking
about
mutilating;
i
am
talking
stop
printing.
that
does
not
cost
you
anything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
stop
printing
those
from
north
carolina.
1%,
you
stop
printing
1%
of
the
number
you
print.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
where
do
we
get
the
1%?
your
1%
is
a
firm
figure.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
think
north
carolina
wants
you
to
--
did
north
carolina
(inaudible)
what
you
ship
to
new
york?
justice
thurgood
marshall
general
gorton,
are
you,
by
statute,
representing
any
trade
association
in
washington?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you,
as
attorney
general,
represent
any
trade
associations
in
washington?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
they
are
not,
they
are
not
the
same.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
admitted
the
state
agency.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
be
an
association
handle
state
agency?
justice
thurgood
marshall
generally
the
real
problem
is
that
one
grower
would
not
have
$10,000
jurisdiction.
that
is
maybe
the
real
problem.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
did
you
show
by
affidavit?
