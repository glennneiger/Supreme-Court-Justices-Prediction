unknown
speaker
is
your
state
of
north
carolina
one
of
the
13
states
that
commercially
produce
apples?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
true
that
apples
produced
in
your
state
and
sold
to
wholesalers
in
your
state
would
not
be
in
closed
containers?
unknown
speaker
but
all
apples
imported
into
north
carolina
from
washington
and
sold
to
wholesalers
in
north
carolina
would
be
in
closed
containers?
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree
that
the
washington
commission
performs
substantially
the
functions
of
the
traditional
trade
association
of
growers
or
manufacturers.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
district
court’s
reference
in
the
opinion
to
the
association
was
freudian
slip
then?
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
state
governmental
agency,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
but
would
you
say
that
this
state
agency
does
not
perform
substantially
the
same
functions
as
trade
association?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
talking
about
standing,
aren’t
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
jordan,
excuse
me.
would
you
say
that
the
plaintiffs
would
have
standing
if
the
statute
said
there
should
be
no
advertising
on
the
containers?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
am
asking
if
the
statute
said
that
do
you
think
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
would
have
standing.
unknown
speaker
but,
isn’t
this
statute
similar
to
that,
that
it
limits
the
kind
of
advertising
that
can
go
on
the
containers,
rather
to
say
it
you
may
not
advertise
the
washington
grade
on
the
containers?
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
saying
in
affect
is
that
putting
the
grades
and
the
labeled
is
not
a
legitimate
form
of
advertising,
and
if
you
say
that,
haven’t
you
conceded
standing?
that’s
what
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
mr.
jordan,
can
you
explain
to
me,
why
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
discuss
the
standing
point
other
than
to
say
that
it
had
been
decided?
unknown
speaker
so,
it
was
not
discussed?
unknown
speaker
suppose
instead
of
designating
this
commission,
the
legislature
of
washington
had
used
the
word
“association”
spoken
in
terms
of
membership.
would
your
view
be
the
same
because
of
the
alleged
exercise
of
police
power?
unknown
speaker
what
do
trade
associations
do
that
this
commission
does
not
do?
unknown
speaker
i
did
not
think
it
was
a
matter
of
belonging,
i
thought
it
was
a
matter
of
having
a
burden
accessed
in
sort
of
a
quasi
tax
by
governmental
agency.
i
did
not
know
this
council
had
members.
unknown
speaker
but
growers
do
not
belong
to
this,
there
is
simply
tax
to
support
it,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
perhaps
your
use
of
the
term
“belonging”
was
the
same
kind
of
a
freudian
slip
as
the
district
court
may
refer
to
the
association.
unknown
speaker
you
have
not
left
a
question
of
standing,
have
you?
unknown
speaker
you
did
not
mention
parens
patriae
as
a
theory?
unknown
speaker
mr.
jordan,
does
north
carolina
provide
a
state
grading
system
to
apples?
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean
that
box
containing
the
apples
is
not
required
to
have
any
grade
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
follow
that
up?
how
does
it
solve
the
purpose
of
informing
the
market
as
to
the
grades
of
apples
if
the
container
may
contain
no
grade
at
all?
unknown
speaker
mr.
jordan,
the
statute
does
not
prohibit
the
use
of
the
various
grades
for
the
purpose
of
quoting
prices
or
recording
prices
or
anything
like
that,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
now,
one
of
the
reasons
you
are
here
today
is
whether
or
not
your
client
had
standing
to
sue.
are
you
going
to
get
to
that,
because
it
seemed
to
me
the
threshold
question
that
you
would
--
so
long
as
you
are
going
to
get
to
that.
unknown
speaker
yes,
just
as
a
fish
or
wildlife
commission
of
a
state,
every
state
acts
through
its
agencies
and
that
department
of
a
state
would
have
be
representing
the
conservation
interest
of
the
state
and
the
fisherman
and
the
hunters
of
the
state.
that
would
still
be
the
state
though
when
it
is
sued.
unknown
speaker
you
have
told
us,
you
do
not
have
any
membership;
let’s
say,
you
have
something
like
a
membership.
unknown
speaker
those
people
who
produce
apples
in
the
state
of
washington?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
a
parents
patria
interest,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
at
that
point
general
gorton,
could
i
just
ask
this
question?
as
i
understand
that
your
budget
is
made
up
of
the
revenues
coming
on
a
ship,
the
growers
in
your
state
are
assessed
a
fixed
amount
per
bushel
shipped,
or
something
like
that.
so
that
the
number
of
bushel
shipped
determines
your
revenue.
unknown
speaker
have
you
alleged
--
and
i
do
not
think
you
have,
but
i
want
you
to
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
--
have
you
alleged
that
the
volume
of
your
shipments
is
adversely
affected
by
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
that
does
not
be
the
answer
of
the
question
because
if
the
apples
go
elsewhere
your
budget
would
be
same.
unknown
speaker
which
assessment
--
unknown
speaker
which
assessment
has
not
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
so,
how
much
has
the
party
lost?
unknown
speaker
how
much
money
has
washington
state
apple
advertising
commission
lost?
unknown
speaker
oh,
you
have
lost
$25,000?
unknown
speaker
did
you
consider
bringing
an
original
suit
in
this
court?
unknown
speaker
in
your
statutory
authority,
general
gorton,
to
sue
and
be
sued
is
your
statutory
authority
to
sue
in
the
name
of
the
state
or
i
assume
to
just
sue
in
the
name
of
the
commission.
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
case
of
city
of
milwaukee
or
rather
the
state
of
illinois
v.
city
of
milwaukee
several
years
back
would
be
any
guide
that
at
least
makes
suggest
that
you
perhaps
would
not
have
an
original
case
here.
unknown
speaker
when
you
use
the
term
‘association’
--
i
think
you
are
using
at
lower
case
on
the
‘a’
that
is
small
letter
‘a’
association
--
these
people
are
associated
together
by
law,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
taxpayers
of
the
state
are
associated
by
mandate
of
law
and
the
government
of
the
state.
unknown
speaker
all
taxpayers
at
least.
