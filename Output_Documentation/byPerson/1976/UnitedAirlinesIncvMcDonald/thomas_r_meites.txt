mr.
thomas
r.
meites
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
notion
that
this
case
involves
american
pipe,
we
think,
is
misplaced.
we
think
this
case
involves
a
very
conventional
kind
of
intervention
question
under
rule
24.
american
pipe
was
a
case
where
the
persons
excluded
by
the
class
ruling
determined
they
wanted
to
bring
individual
actions.
they
brought
individual
actions,
they
chose
to
bring
them
in
utah
in
the
same
form
as
american
pipe
had
pending.
this
court
held
in
american
pipe
that
those
persons
had
the
benefit
of
a
tolling
during
the
pendency
of
the
class
action
or
until
the
class
was
adversely
determined
and,
since
they
filed
within
eight
days
of
that,
they
were
timely.
but
those
interveners
took
the
case
as
they
found
it.
as
far
as
the
records
go
of
the
lower
court
decisions,
they
were
not
interested
at
all
in
challenging
the
adverse
class
ruling.
it
was
by
an
experienced
judge
who
had
handled
a
number
of
similar
cases,
and
apparently
it
seemed
to
them
that
his
reasons
were
pretty
good.
instead
of
taking
a
chance
on
a
procedural
appeal
years
later,
they
came
into
that
court
and
said,
“we
will
hazard
our
luck
in
that
form.”
we
took
just
the
opposite
track.
in
this
case,
we
relied
on
our
class
champions
until
final
judgment
was
entered;
we
then
learned
that
they
were
going
to
abandon
us.
at
that
point,
we
only
had
one
choice;
we
had
to
continue
this
case
through
appeal.
that’s
exactly
what
we
did.
we
took
the
case
as
we
found
it
with
whatever
inadequacies
it
might
have
had
as
far
as
timeliness
or
the
measure
of
remedy
that
had
been
determined
in
earlier
phases,
and
we
staked
our
all
on
continuing
that
case
through
appeal.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
we
never
filed
our
own
eeoc
carriage.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
so
we
could
not
but
for
the
umbrella
of
this
case.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
now,
i
think
mr.
bernstein
is
correct.
i
think
we
only
had
2
days
to
file
it;
but
even
if
we
had
62,
we
could
have
gone
into
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
paid
our
$15
and
filed
our
own
case,
or
we
could
have
tried
to
intervene
in
the
existing
case.
we
didn’t
do
either
of
those.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
that
is
right.
mr.
bernstein
said
we
had
to
do
that,
and
i
submit
that’s
not
compelled
by
american
pipe.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
we
could
have
done
that.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
no,
no.
once
we
had
not
done
that,
once
that
2
days
passed
or
the
62
days
had
passed,
the
only
thing
left
for
us
to
do
after
our
the
class
champions
abdicated
was
to
continue
this
case
through
appeal.
there
was
no
other
choice.
now,
in
december
19
--
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
that’s
right.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
after
the
statute
of
limitations
has
run.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
no,
i
don’t
think
it
confers
additional
rights
because
of
the
statute,
and
i’d
see
it
the
other
way
around.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
well,
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
we
didn’t.
first
of
all,
we
were
represented
at
that
point
by
the
lawyers
who
had
demonstrated
their
competence
to
carry
this
case
through
its
conclusion.
they
had
brought
the
original
sprogis
case,
the
case
on
liability.
they
had
attempted
to
convert
that
case
into
a
class
case.
they’d
persuaded
the
seventh
circuit
that
that
was
proper.
unfortunately,
on
remand
the
district
court
judge
decided
he
wouldn't
do
it.
the
next
step
they
took
was
to
try
to
get
class
treatment
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
when
that
failed,
they
attempted
to
get
interlocutory
review
from
the
seventh
circuit.
that
failed,
as
well.
at
that
point
ms.
mcdonald
was
represented
by
lawyers
who
had
lived
with
this
case
for
four
years
who
had
taken
every
possible
step
available
to
them
to
represent
her
interests,
and
they
had
given
her
every
indication
they
would
continue
to
represent
her
interests
through
appeal
and,
of
course,
that
if
she
had
--
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
throughout,
until
final
judgment
was
entered
on
october
1975,
she
was
fully
represented
by
them.
if
she
had
intervened,
first
of
all,
if
she
had
come
to
me
in
december
1972
and
said,
“mr.
meites,
should
i
petition
to
intervene,
or
should
i
continue
the
case
as
i
found
it?”
i
would
have
to
advise
her
to
do
exactly
what
she
did.
the
choice
on
the
one
side
where
she
is
represented
by
competent
counsel
at
no
expense
to
herself
who
had
given
every
indication
of
doing
a
crackerjack
job.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
no.
no,
it's
more
than
that.
it
is
counsel
that
had
demonstrated
that
they
are
working
for
her
interests.
they
brought
it
as
a
class
action,
they
took
every
possible
step
they
could
to
maintain
it
as
a
class
action.
judge
perry
had
ruled
that
he
would
not
permit
someone
like
mrs.
mcdonald
to
intervene;
so
if
she
tried
to
intervene
in
1972,
it
would
have
been
denied.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
she
could
have
appealed
with
the
additional
--
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
no,
no,
it
is
not.
if
she
had
appealed
in
1972,
perhaps
the
seventh
circuit
would
have
reversed;
perhaps
they
would
not
have.
they
might
have
found
that
that
ruling
for
a
number
of
reasons
was
correct
as
to
her.
she
would
then,
i
think,
be
out
of
the
box.
mr.
bernstein
will
be
arguing
today
that
res
judicata
foreclosed
her
later
action.
let’s
say
she
succeeded
on
that
appeal.
she
would’ve
gone
back,
and
judge
perry
would
have
let
her
in
the
case.
she
would
have
won,
i
imagine.
but
at
the
end
of
the
case,
there’s
no
reason
that
mr.
bernstein
and
his
clients
would
not
have
been
able
to
settle
with
her
and
she
would
not
be
interested
in
appealing.
if
she
--
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
she
would
not
have
been
permitted
to
intervene.
judge
perry
in
his
ruling
of
december
6
said
he
would
not
permit
anyone
to
intervene
who
had
not
individually
protested.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
and
then
appealed.
and
if
she
had
done
that,
she
would
have
been
no
better
off
than
where
she
ended
up
and
where
everyone
else
in
this
case
ended
up.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
oh,
yes,
she
would
have.
the
case
would
have
been
delayed
--
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
no,
she
would
have
received
relief.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
the
delay
in
for
her
to
get
that
relief.
in
december
1972,
the
seventh
circuit
had
approximately
a
two-year
backlog
in
hearing
oral
arguments.
if
she
had
filed
that
petition
to
intervene,
i
suggest
that
the
defendants
would
have
stayed
the
main
case
pending
the
appeal,
because
the
intervention
appeal
might
have
changed
the
dimensions
of
the
case
in
the
trial
court.
two
years
would
have
been
wasted
where
not
one
stewardess
would
have
been
able
to
go
back
to
work
and
go
flying.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
only
in
the
sense
that
every
absent
class
member
is
represented
by
the
named
plaintiffs
and
their
attorneys,
not
--
there
was
no
direct
representation.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
no,
i
meant
only
to
suggest
that
she
and
everyone
else
were
represented
by
these
people
who
were
working
as
hard
as
they
were
on
her
behalf,
attempting
to
get
class
treatment.
the
rule
that
united
advocates
would
compel
every
single
excluded
class
member
to
walk
into
a
district
court.
everyone
has
to
press
their
own
claims
within
2
days
or
62
days
or
before
foreclosed.
this
would
effectively
mean
that
when
the
case
was
over,
the
adverse
class
ruling
would
have
been
shielded
from
review.
there
is
no
real
suggestion
that
someone
seriously
wants
5,000
people
in
a
large
case
to
walk
in,
file
their
individual
petitions
to
intervene
with
their
individual
attorneys;
but
if
you
adopt
a
rule
supposedly
compelled
by
american
pipe,
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
avoid
that
result.
we
do
not
advocate
any
rule
at
all.
i
think
all
we
see
this
case
involves
is
applying
the
rule
this
court
announced
in
naacp
v.
new
york;
that
timeliness
is
determined
from
all
the
circumstances.
the
single
most
important
circumstance
here
is
not
the
case
took
two
years,
took
five
years
or
seven
years.
that
is
largely
because
the
seventh
circuit
has
not
permitted
interlocutory
appeals
of
adverse
class
rulings.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
no,
i
don’t
think
that
i’m
saying
that.
when
we
filed
our
notice
of
appeal
within
30
days
of
the
entry
of
the
final
judgment,
our
filing
the
notice
of
appeal
did
not
slow
this
case
down
one
jot.
admittedly,
we
appealed,
not
the
named
plaintiffs;
but
we
did
not
file
five
years
after
final
judgment,
we
filed
18
days
after
final
judgment.
we
filed
within
the
original
30
days
--
before
the
30
days
for
the
plaintiffs
to
appeal
would
have
expired.
if
we
come
in
five
years
later
in
1982,
i
imagine
i’d
have
a
very
difficult
time
persuading
you
that
i
was
not
out
of
time.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
i
don’t
know.
i
had
a
very
real
problem
when
i
was
preparing
the
papers
for
the
intervention.
i
was
concerned
that
judge
perry
would
not
decide
our
petition
to
intervene
within
30
days,
and
i
frankly
didn’t
know
whether
i
could
go
ahead
and
file
a
notice
of
appeal
before
my
petitioner
to
intervene
was
decided.
well,
fortunately,
he
decided
the
day
i
filed
it,
and
i
filed
my
notice
of
appeal
and
the
petition
the
next
day.
the
question
you’re
raising
is
a
difficult
question.
it's
not
because
of
the
way
this
case
was
resolved
posed
by
this
case.
i
think
that
mr.
bernstein’s
argument
turns
ultimately
on
the
court
being
asked
to
put
on
a
set
of
blinders
only
to
one
factor,
the
factor
of
when
mechanically
a
statute
of
limitations
applied
to
an
individual
action
might
run.
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
rule
24
does
not
answer
that.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
and
i
suggest
that
the
answer
is,
when
the
intervention
is
not
for
purposes
of
pressing
an
individual
case
…
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
but
for
the
purposes
of
taking
the
case
as
you
find
it
and
continuing
it
through
appellate
review
of
the
class
determination,
the
answer
is,
no.
the
statute
of
limitations
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
as
far
as
i
can
tell
--
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
in
all
the
timeliness
of
intervention
cases,
the
statute
of
limitations
plays
virtually
no
role.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
that’s
what
i
said
in
my
--
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
that’s
correct.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
no,
there
are
a
number
of
cases
--
most
of
them
actually
come
from
the
d.c.
circuit
--
where
intervention
after
judgment
has
been
allowed.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
no,
and
as
far
as
my
reading
of
those
cases
goes,
there
is
never
a
discussion
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
all
i
can
--
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
so
all
i
can
conclude
is
that
until
this
case,
no
one
has
suggested
the
timeliness
in
rule
24
means
as
defined
by
a
statute
of
limitations
may
or
may
not
have
run
as
to
an
individual
action.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
i
think
it
is.
i
think
that
that
distinguishes
--
not
“distinguishes”;
but
american
pipe
shouldn’t
even
be
distinguished;
it
is
about
a
different
kind
of
situation.
i
don’t
think
this
court
has
been
faced
until
this
case
with
an
intervention-after-judgment
case;
but
i
don’t
think
it
represents
anything
radically
new.
i
think
that
it’s
a
timeliness
case
under
naacp
v.
new
york.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
that’s
right.
and
as
construed
by
this
court,
that
means
you
look
at
all
the
circumstances
and
you
ask
yourself,
did
the
intervener
act
reasonably?
in
this
case,
the
seventh
circuit
found,
first
of
all,
that
she
acted
as
soon
as
her
class
champions
had
indicated
to
her
that
they
would
no
longer
continue
to
advance
her
interests.
secondly,
they
concluded
there
was
no
prejudice
to
united.
united
knew,
or
should
have
known
since
this
case
was
filed
and
it’s
based
on
substantial
exposure
to
a
great
number
of
people.
it
had
decided
to
run
its
airline
on
a
policy
of
having
primary
services,
it
took
a
risk.
the
law
was
changed;
but
three
years
after
that
law
was
changed,
it
persisted
in
its
policy.
it's
a
mature
business
corporation,
and
if
it
lost,
it
lost.
when
this
suit
was
filed,
i
think
it
had
no
doubt
that
it
faced
substantial
exposure.
the
only
difference
about
this
case
is
that
the
appeal
was
prosecuted
not
by
romasanta,
but
by
mcdonald.
there
is
no
other
difference
as
far
as
i
can
see
in
where
we
are
today.
the
second
point
that
mr.
bernstein
made
which
troubled
me
is
the
notion
that
somehow
what
we
did
will
impede
settlements;
that
somehow
it's
only
possible
for
defendants
to
settle
these
cases
if
they
can
buy
off
the
right
of
appeal.
well,
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
that’s
not
the
kind
of
settlement
that
should
be
encouraged
on
any
kind
of
case
and
certainly
not
in
title
vii,
where
congress
has
made
clear
and
this
court
has
made
clear
that
every
effort
should
be
made
to
accord
class-wide
relief.
and
in
fact,
in
this
case,
the
named
plaintiffs
in
no
way
sold
out
their
right
to
appeal.
there’s
not
one
word
in
the
settlement
agreement
that
they
promised
not
to
appeal.
the
usual
way
you
handle
this,
i’m
informed,
is,
you
hold
off
paying
out
the
money
till
31
days
have
expired.
in
this
case,
they
paid
all
the
money
over
before.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
i
think
that
the
defendant
could
perhaps
move
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
of
breach
of
contract,
or
lack
of
standing
to
prosecute
the
appeal.
that’s
an
interesting
case.
i
don’t
know
of
any
instance
where
it’s
been
done.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
well,
it
could
be
done.
i
imagine
it
would
be
subject
to
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
would
succeed.
but
in
this
case,
it
was
not
done.
there
was
not
one
word
in
writing
or
in
fact
in
which
that
these
named
plaintiffs
said,
“we
will
not
prosecute
an
appeal
for
the
absent
class
members.”
i
can’t
imagine
an
attorney
ever
agreeing
to
that,
and
if
he
did,
he’d
be
a
fool
to
put
it
in
writing.
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
sir?
mr.
thomas
r.
meites
they
decided
after
a
final
judgment
not
to
appeal.
