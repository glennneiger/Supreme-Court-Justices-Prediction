stewart
the
second
case
in
which
i
am
authorized
to
announce
the
opinion
and
judgment
of
the
court
this
morning
is
united
airlines,
incorporated
against
liane
buix
mcdonald,
number
76-545,
the
case
which
is
hereby
way
of
the
grant
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
rule
24
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
requires
that
an
application
to
intervene
in
federal
litigation
must
be
timely.
in
this
case,
a
motion
to
intervene
was
filed
promptly
after
the
final
judgment
of
a
district
court
for
the
purpose
of
appealing
the
court's
earlier
denial
of
class
action
certification.
the
question
presented
is
whether
this
motion
was
timely
under
rule
24.
the
suit
was
originally
brought
as
a
class
action
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
it
attacked
the
now
abrogated
policy
of
united
airlines
requiring
its
female
flight
attendants
to
remain
unmarried
as
a
condition
of
their
continued
employment.
the
respondent,
a
former
united
airlines
stewardess,
was
an
unnamed
member
of
the
putative
class.
during
the
course
of
the
litigation,
the
district
court
stripped
the
case
of
its
character
as
a
class
action
and
ultimately
granted
relief
to
the
named
plaintiffs.
during
the
time
allowed
for
an
appeal
for
the
final
judgment,
the
respondent
moved
to
intervene
in
the
district
court
for
the
sole
purpose
of
appealing
the
court's
earlier
order
denying
class
action
status.
the
district
court
held
that
this
motion
came
too
late,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed.
we
now
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
reason
set
out
in
a
written
opinion
of
the
court
filed
today
with
the
clerk.
we
hold
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
respondent's
motion
to
intervene
was
a
timely
one
under
rule
24.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
white
have
joined
and
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
