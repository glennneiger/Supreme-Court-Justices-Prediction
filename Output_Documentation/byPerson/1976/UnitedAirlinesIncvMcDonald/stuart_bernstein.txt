mr.
stuart
bernstein
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
generally
out
of
the
same
no-marriage
rule
which
we
had
occasion
to
examine
in
the
evans
case,
but
presents
an
entirely
different
question.
the
question
here
is
the
status
of
unnamed
class
members
after
denial
of
class
by
the
district
court.
this
case
is
a
corollary
of
american
pipe
&
construction
co.
versus
utah,
414
u.
s.
538,
decided
by
this
court
in
1974.
because
this
relies
so
heavily
on
american
pipe,
by
which
we
don’t
want
to
indulge,
we
would
briefly
state
the
circumstances
there.
in
american
pipe,
a
class
action
was
filed
eleven
days
before
the
statutory
period
would
have
otherwise
expired.
the
district
court
ultimately
denied
class
status
on
the
basis
of
numerosity,
so
nine
months
after
the
suit
was
filed
and
leaving
eleven
days
left
for
the
statutory
period
to
run,
which
includes
it,
i
suppose.
within
eight
days,
a
number
of
interveners
came
in,
attempted
to
intervene,
and
the
district
court
held
intervention
was
untimely,
because
since
class
had
been
denied,
the
tolling
which
occurred
on
the
filing
of
the
suit
was
retroactively
un-tolled
and
since
the
eleven
days
had
long
since
expired,
they
were
late.
the
interveners
then
appealed
the
denial
of
intervention.
it
ultimately
came
to
this
court,
and
the
court
held
that
on
the
filing
examined
the
practice
under
rule
23
prior
to
the
1966
amendments,
one-way
intervention
problems
and
matters
of
that
kind,
and
then
stated
as
the
general
rule
that
when
a
class
action
is
filed,
it
tolls
the
time
limitations
for
all
unnamed
potential
class
members
--
whether
they
were
aware
of
the
suit
or
unaware
of
the
suit
was
a
matter
of
indifference
--
but
that
that
tolling
continued
only
until
the
motion
to
strip
the
suit
of
its
class-action
character
was
decided.
since
that
decision
was
made
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
the
court
put
it
in
terms
of
denied,
sir,
because
it
had
been
denied.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
class
status
was
denied,
yes,
sir.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
i
double-negatived
(sic)
that.
forgive
me,
sir.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that
is
correct.
and
class
action
having
been
denied,
the
statutory
period
began
to
run
again;
but
since
they
had
coming
within
eight
days,
they
were
timely
and
the
interventions
were
allowed.
in
the
case
here,
ms.
mcdonald
has
come
in
three
years
after
class-action
denial;
in
fact,
after
the
final
order
of
dismissal
upon
which
this
suit
was
settled.
since
the
circumstances
out
of
which
the
particular
instance
arise
here,
i
am
going
to
briefly
recapitulate
the
history
of
the
immediate
litigation
which
gave
rise
to
this
case.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes,
sir.
it
is
our
position
there
were
62
days
left…
mr.
stuart
bernstein
…
and
here’s
the
mathematics
on
that.
at
the
time
the
suit
was
filed,
it
had
to
be
filed
within
30
days
if
my
time’s
right;
yes,
30
days
of
receipt
of
the
suit
letter.
it
was
filed
two
days
short
of
the
expiration
date;
thus,
there
were
two
days
left.
by
the
time
class
was
denied,
the
statutory
period
had
been
enlarged
to
90
days,
and
so
we
are
deducting
the
28
days
from
the
90
days,
which
leaves
a
net
of
62
days
that
were
left
in
our
theory
for
ms.
mcdonald
to
have
acted.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes,
sir,
i
will
get
to
that,
and
i
think
that
is
a
critical
point,
because
in
our
view
the
seventh
circuit
had
no
power
--
and
“power”
is
its
term,
not
mine.
i
believe
the
seventh
circuit
had
no
power
to
decide
that
question,
because
it
did
not
have
a
party
before
it.
it
first
had
to
decide
whether
intervention
was
proper
before
it
could
get
to
that
question.
i
will
subsequently
argue
to
the
court
that
the
basis
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
intervention
was
timely
was
improper;
but
the
way
the
court
proceeded
was
to
say,
“we
hold
the
intervention
was
timely
here,
because
it
wasn’t
until
after
the
final
dismissal
of
this
case
that
ms.
mcdonald
knew
that
the
named
claimants
were
not
going
to
appeal
class;
therefore,
it
was
timely.
now,
we
find
it
timely;
therefore,
we
have
the
power
to
examine
the
question
of
class.”
we
say
it’s
just
the
other
way
around;
the
district
court
held
that
intervention
was
untimely
coming
this
late,
and
that
that
should
have
ended
the
case
in
our
view
and
never
gotten
to
the
second
point.
there
were
two
notices
of
appeal
filed,
one
on
the
denial
of
an
intervention
and
one
on
the
class
question.
our
point
was
that
once
it…
it
should
have
gotten
only
to
that
first
one,
the
proper
decision
should
have
been
that
it
was
not
timely
--
coming
in
three
years
late
was
not
timely
--
and
therefore
we
never
get
to
the
second
point.
but
i
would
like
to
develop
that
through
the
history
of
this
litigation,
if
i
may,
please.
as
i
indicated
earlier,
it
was
november
of
1968
that
united
terminated
the
no-marriage
policy.
two
weeks
later,
a
suit
was
filed
against
it,
sprogis
suit,
also
referred
to
during
the
course
of
the
evidence
argument.
it
was
an
individual
action
filed
by
mrs.
sprogis
on
her
own
behalf,
claiming
that
the
policy
was
a
violation
of
the
sex-discrimination
provisions
of
title
vii.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
mrs.
sprogis;
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
it
in
a
two-to-one
decision,
and
dissent
was
by
justice
stevens.
this
court
denied
certiorari
sometime
in
1972.
while
these
appeals
were
pending,
while
the
appeal
was
pending
of
the
sprogis
case,
another
suit
was
filed
by
the
same
counsel,
making
the
same
allegations;
but
now,
it
was
a
class
action.
this
is
the
romasanta
case,
and
there
it
was
alleged
that
the
class
would
consist
of
all
stewardesses
who
had
been
discharged
under
this
policy
and
that
the
class
numbered
some
27
or
28.
these
are
the
allegations
in
the
record
in
the
complaint
and
in
the
record
before
you.
the
court
held
this
on
the
past
case
calendar
pending
the
result
of
the
appeal
in
the
sprogis
case,
which
was
then
up
before
the
seventh
circuit.
when
sprogis
was
decided
by
the
district
court,
the
counsel
for
mrs.
sprogis
asked
the
court
to
at
that
point
make
a
class
action
out
of
it;
that
is,
after
the
decision
on
the
merits
of
sprogis,
which
had
been
started
as
an
individual
case,
be
converted
into
a
class
case,
and
that
was
one
of
the
issue
on
appeal,
where
after
decision
on
the
merits,
an
individual
case
action
could
be
converted
into
a
class
action.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
district
court
had
the
power
to
entertain
such
a
motion,
but
should
be
mindful
of
the
principles
of
rule
23.
in
a
remand,
then,
romasanta,
the
class-action
case,
sprogis
the
remanded
individual
case
on
conversion
of
the
class,
motions
were
made
then
to
consolidate
those
two
cases
by
joint
counsel.
we
resisted
the
motion
to
consolidate
and
the
motion
to
convert
sprogis
into
a
class
action,
and
the
court
granted
our
motion
and
did
deny
class
relief
in
the
sprogis
case.
there
were
no
attempted
interventions
at
that
time.
consolidation
was
denied,
sprogis
was
referred
to
a
special
master
for
a
determination
of
a
back-pay
award
and
ultimately
mrs.
sprogis
was
granted
some
$10,000
in
back
pay.
she
had,
incidentally,
been
back
to
work
early
in
1969.
shortly
after
she
filed
her
suit,
she
was
offered
re-employment
with
seniority,
and
she
did
come
back
to
work.
it’s
clear
she
had
filed
a
timely
charge
under
the
act;
there
is
no
question
of
timeliness
connected
with
that
whatsoever.
the
sprogis
case
was
appealed,
but
not
on
the
denial
of
class
action;
it
was
appealed
on
denial
of
attorney
fees.
the
district
court
refused
to
allow
attorney
fees
in
that
case
because
of
what
it
felt
was
some
impropriety
in
the
sponsorship
of
the
litigation.
that
has
no
relevance
to
this
case
and
no
more
need
to
pursue
that,
but
attorney
fees
were
denied.
there
was
a
cross-appeal
on
the
question
of
the
measure
of
damages
and
back
pay,
what
duty
did
the
discriminatee
have
to
mitigate,
and
the
court
had
held
that
the
burden
was
on
united
airlines
to
prove
that
there
was
not
due
care
exercised
in
mitigation
rather
than
on
the
discriminatee
to
prove
that,
in
fact,
attempts
had
been
made
to
mitigate.
well,
all
that
held
up
the
proceedings
in
the
romasanta
case.
when
that
was
all
out
of
the
way,
then
we
foiled
a
motion
to
strike
the
class-action
allegations
in
the
second
case,
in
the
romasanta
case,
and
in
december
6th
of
1972
judge
powell
did
grant
our
motion,
struck
the
class
action
generally
on
a
theory
that
since
its
time
had
passed
and
since
it
was
not
possible
to
know
whether
a
stewardess
terminated
did
so
because
of
the
rule
or
despite
the
rule;
and
there
was
evidence,
as
i
had
indicated
earlier,
that
many
employees
quit
their
employment
or
waited
for
discharge
in
any
event
and
that
it
wasn’t
necessarily
because
of
the
rule,
but
because
of
marriage.
he
found
that
there
had
to
be
some
manifestation
on
their
part
that
they
really
were
interested
in
continued
employment.
but
so
he
limited
the
class
to
those
who
had
filed
grievances
or
had
taken
some
action
before
the
commission,
the
federal
commission,
the
eeoc,
or
before
some
state
agency,
the
new
york
civil
rights
commission,
the
illinois
fair
employment
practice
commission
and
so
on.
he
then
entertained
intervention,
provisions
to
intervene
by
25
interveners,
and
he
granted
the
intervention
petitions
of
13
and
denied
them
as
to
the
others.
one
of
the
other
factors
was
that
a
number
of
the
stewardesses
had
settled
their
claims,
entered
into
settlement
agreements
with
united.
he
said
they
were
bound
by
those.
others
had
instituted
litigation
in
other
courts,
and
he
didn’t
permit
those
to
come
in.
so
he
held
the
class
to
be
a
narrow
one
and,
based
on
that
holding,
said
that
numerosity
failed
and,
therefore,
the
intervention
would
be
allowed;
and
as
i
say,
13
intervened,
12
were
disallowed.
there
were
no
attempts
to
appeal
the
denials
of
intervention.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that’s
correct,
sir.
that’s
correct.
there
were
no
attempts
to
appeal
the
denial
of
intervention
in
that
case.
counsel
for
plaintiffs
did
attempt
a
1292(b)
permissive
appeal
for
the
denial
of
class,
and
that
was
denied.
but
that
appeal
was
by
the
named
plaintiffs,
not
by
the
interveners
who
had
been
not
allowed
to
intervene
with
respect
to
whom
the
case
was
over,
and
the
order
was
final
and
with
respect
to
whom
an
appeal
would
not
have
been
interlocutory.
no
attempt
at
that
time
was
made
by
ms.
mcdonald
to
intervene.
well,
then
counsel
for
both
sides
entered
into
settlement
discussions.
they
had
some
13
interveners,
2
named
plaintiffs
at
that
time,
and
they
tried
to
settle
up
their
differences.
there
was
no
question
then
about
the
liability;
that
had
already
been
settled
in
sprogis
in
71.
the
only
question
was
how
much
back
pay.
and
again,
most
of
the
reinstatements
had
been
cleared
out
because
of
the
earlier
tender.
finally,
in
october
2
of
1975,
three
years
later,
an
agreed
order
of
settlement
was
arrived
at
between
counsel
for
both
parties;
back
pay
was
agreed
upon,
and
an
order
was
entered
by
the
court
dismissing
the
case
with
prejudice,
reciting
that
the
settlements
had
been
agreed
upon
and
that
there
were
no
further
claims
to
be
adjudicated;
and
as
i
say,
the
case
was
dismissed
with
prejudice.
it
was
two
weeks
after
that
that
ms.
mcdonald
first
appeared.
now
this
would
have
been
seven
years
after
she
was
terminated,
five
years
after
the
case
started,
and
three
years
after
class
action
was
denied.
she
submitted
an
affidavit
at
that
time,
saying
that
when
she
was
terminated
in
september
of
1968,
she
didn’t
do
anything
on
her
own
behalf,
because
she
knew
other
people
were
doing
something
about
it
and
she
was
relying
on
them.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
referred
to
the
extraordinary
foresight
which
might
have
been
present
in
his
questioning
of
mr.
kessler
earlier.
but
here
was
a
great
bit
of
foresight,
because
at
that
time,
in
september
of
1968,
this
court
hadn’t
decided
in
the
albemarle
case
that
a
class
action
was
appropriate
for
back
pay.
the
only
decision
in
the
area
at
that
time
was
an
august
1968
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
oatis
versus
crown
zellerbach,
which
said
you
could
have
class
action
for
reinstatement
for
injunctive
relief,
but
not
for
back
pay.
so
this
was
great
prescience
that
was
exercised
ms.
mcdonald
in
september
of
1968
to
do
nothing
on
her
own
behalf
and
rely
on
other
people.
and
as
i
indicated,
the
first
suit
filed
two
weeks
later
in
november
of
68
was
an
individual
action,
not
a
class
action;
the
class
action
did
not
come
until
1970.
well,
now,
what
is
the
application
in
this
circumstance
of
the
principles
of
american
pipe?
it
is
our
position
that
when
the
court
denied
class
in
december
of
1962,
at
that
time
it
was
incumbent
upon
ms.
mcdonald
to
act.
her
affidavit
says
she
knew
that
the
court
had
denied
class,
and
her
affidavit
says,
“i
knew
i
was
excluded
from
this
case.”
but
she
took
no
action.
it
is
our
position
that
when
those
62
days
ran
out
that
she
was
time-barred;
that
if
she
wanted
to
get
into
this
case,
she
should
have
acted
within
that
period.
she
should
have
asked
the
district
judge
to
modify
the
order,
his
ruling
on
the
class
motion;
if
it
wasn’t
suitable
to
her,
he
has
the
power
to
modify.
in
fact,
he
said
when
she
came
in
three
years
later,
”why
didn’t
she
come
in
here
earlier?
why
didn’t
she
ask
me
to
modify
the
order?
why
didn’t
she
appeal
at
that
time
if
she
disagreed
with
me?”
he
said,
“litigation
must
end.”
mr.
stuart
bernstein
our
position
is
that
once
class
is
denied,
then
an
individual
who
is
now
no
longer
part
of
the
class
has
to
protect
himself
by
what
other
means
are
available
if
he’s
not
part
of
that
case.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes,
but
the
named
party
may
not
do
so,
sir.
there
is
no
compulsion
on
the
named
party
to
do
so,
and
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that’s
correct.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
but
look
at
the
contrary.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
mr.
justice
blackmun,
look
at
the
contrary
result.
if
you
say
that
you
can
wait
as
long
as
you
waited
here
and
then
do
that
very
thing,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
terms
of
management
of
class
actions,
the
problem
that
a
trial
court
has
-–
mr.
stuart
bernstein
and
the
question
is
whether
-–
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes,
sir.
the
question
is
whether
she
comes
in
too
late
to
do
that.
that’s
the
question
that
we
concede;
that
had
the
case
not
been
settled,
had
the
named
plaintiffs
stood
on
their
…
gone
to
trial
and
had
an
order
on
the
merits
that
they
could
have
appealed.
but
they
put
themselves
in
a
position
because
of
the
settlement
where
they
no
longer
could
appeal,
and
counsel
conceded
that
in
open
court.
he
said,
“having
settled
this,
we
are
in
no
position
to
take
the
appeal.”
mr.
stuart
bernstein
no,
sir.
at
the
time
of
intervention,
one
of
the
unnamed
class
members
intervening
at
that
time
could
have
done
it.
that’s
all
it
would
take.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
he
had
they
intervened
timely
in
1962.
had
they
intervened
in
1962,
because
if
you
play
this
out,
what
would
have
happened,
then,
they
came
in
in
shortly
after
--
let's
suppose
they
came
in
within
the
62
days
after
the
class
was
denied.
they
say
to
the
judge,
“your
honor,
we’d
like
you
to
reconsider
your
ruling
on
the
class;
we
think
it
ought
to
include
us.”
he
says,
“yes,”
then
they’re
in;
he
says,
“no,
i
think
not,”
that
is
a
final
order
they
can
appeal.
that’s
precisely
what
happened
in
american
pipe.
that’s
how
the
appeal
came
up
in
american
pipe
before
final
order.
denial
of
intervention
is
a
final
order
with
respect
to
the
party
-–
mr.
stuart
bernstein
excuse,
me
sir.
then
i
misunderstood
the
question.
of
course
he
has
the
right
to
intervene,
attempt
to
intervene,
and
the
court
has
a
right
to
rule
on
it,
and
he
has
a
right
to
appeal
back.
no
question
about
that.
but
then
the
question
is,
what
standard
does
the
court
of
appeals
apply
in
determining
the
propriety
of
the
district
court’s
action
in
denying
intervention?
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
that
presents
an
interesting
question
here,
because
you
heard
mr.
leven
say
in
the
evans
case
something
about
her
possibility
of
getting
into
the
mcdonald
class.
this
really
illustrates
the
problem.
the
class
asked
for
in
this
instant
case
was
of
all
discharged
stewardesses.
i’m
told
the
class
was
some
27
or
28.
during
the
course
of
that
proceeding,
the
class
asked
for
was
all
discharged
stewardesses
and
all
those
who
resigned
under
protest,
by
making
some
form
of
protest,
because
counsel
for
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
conceded
that
you
couldn’t
tell
by
the
act
of
resignation
whether
it
was
voluntary
or
not,
and
so
you’d
require
something
more.
now,
we
come
to
the
problem
here
where
a
class
would
be
asked
for
which
exceeds
any
class
asked
for
by
the
parties
in
the
original
litigation.
if
this
class
is
to
encompass
ms.
evans,
it
broadens
out
what
anybody
has
asked
for
to
this
point.
let's
play
it
through.
let's
suppose
we
send
this
back
and
say,
“well,
ms.
mcdonald
can
raise
the
point
now.”
the
court
was
in
error
on
the
class
determination
and
it
decides
that
it
will
include
something
like
ms.
mcdonald,
who
was
terminated
without
protest;
but
it
doesn’t
extend
to
anybody
who
resigned
without
protest.
we
play
through
the
whole
thing
again,
we
get
to
the
same
stage,
it's
also
over,
and
then
ms.
evans
come
in
again
another
ten
years
from
now
and
says,
“well,
how
about
me?
that
class
determination
was
wrong.”
this
can
go
on
indefinitely,
simply
as
a
practical
matter
of
how
to
handle
the
litigation
and
class
suit.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
we
say
the
district
court
didn’t
grant
it
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
affirmed
it.
what
happened,
though,
is,
the
district
court
said,
”this
matter
has
been
in
litigation
for
five
years.
litigation
must
end.
this
lady
has
never
saw
fit
to
come
in
here
before,
and
i
must
deny
the
motion.”
i
think
that
is
very
proper
for
the
court
to
say
after
the
case
has
been
going
on
that
long
and
he
has
two
weeks
earlier
signed
an
agreed
order
of
dismissal.
that
is
the
circumstance
we
are
in.
some
of
the
issues
we
allude
to
here,
if
the
court
please,
were
considered
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
court
in
the
case
of
pearson
versus
ecological
science
corporation.
the
case
arises
as
a
fraud
securities
case
presenting
some
of
the
similar
issues;
where
a
class
was
denied,
the
settlements
were
worked
out,
and
then
somebody
tried
to
upset
the
settlement;
in
fact,
one
of
the
persons
who
was
denied
intervention
on
the
grounds
of
timing
attempted
to
intervene
in
a
certiorari
petition
which
was
pending
in
this
court
to
review
the
power
of
a
circuit
court
to
review
the
denial
of
class
by
the
district
court,
very
confused
litigation.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
i
suppose
five
years
is
a
different
circumstance
in
intervening
within
thirty
days,
--
during
which
time
there
is
a
statutory
appeal
period.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that
is
correct,
yeah.
that
is
correct.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes,
sir.
we
obviously
agree
with
judge
pell’s
reasoning,
because
he
agreed
with
us,
in
that
he
said
she
should
have
come
in
after
that,
taken
appropriate
action
and,
if
she
wasn’t
availing,
she
should
have
appealed
then,
and
we
would
have
been
done
with
this
three
years
ago.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes,
of
course,
your
honor;
of
course.
the
question
is,
what
standards
of
review
does
the
court
of
appeals
apply
in
reviewing
the
denial
of
intervention
by
the
district
court?
we
never
challenged
the
right
of
the
intervener
here,
the
attempted
intervener,
to
appeal
the
denial
of
intervention.
what
we
did
challenge
was
the
notice
to
appeal
the
review
of
class
action,
because
our
position
was,
until
you
decided
you
had
a
proper
intervener,
you’ve
got
no
party
before
the
court
to
properly
challenge
the
class
denial.
the
court
of
appeals
took
that
step,
but
we
say
the
standards
that
applied
in
determining
that
the
intervention
was
timely
or
improper.
we
say
that
the
time
limits
had
long
since
run
out
on
this
and
that
certainly
for
a
district
court
to
say
that
you
come
in
five
years
after
this
has
started
and
three
years
after
i
have
entered
my
order,
you
are
too
late.
it’s
a
proper
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
trial
judge.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
in
our
view
it
does;
in
our
view,
sir
i
think
this
is
how
we
read
american
pipe,
because
in
american
pipe
clearly
what
the
court
said
was
that
you
came
in
timely
because
you
came
in
on
the
eighth
day
and
eleven
were
left.
the
clear
implication
was
if
you
came
in
on
the
twelfth
day,
you’re
too
late.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
stuart
bernstein
but
then
you
have
a
party
who
is
a
proper
appellant.
if
the
case
is
already
on
appeal,
you
must
have
an
appellant.
our
point
is
that
if
you
are
not
a
proper
intervener,
then
once
that
is
determined,
there
is
no
appellant.
the
main
plaintiffs
here
could
not
appeal.
they
have
settled
the
case.
i
think
whether
they
couldn’t
appeal
or
didn’t
want
to
appeal
is
a
matter
of
no
legal
difference,
because
it
was
their
case
to
control.
once
class
was
denied,
moore
says
that
once
the
motion
to
strip
the
case
of
its
class-action
status
is
granted,
it’s
no
longer
a
class-action
case.
that
being
so,
there
is
no
class
representative.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was,
that
until
the
champion
of
the
class
advocated,
the
motions
were
timely;
but
once
class
was
denied,
there
was
no
class
anymore.
there
was
no
champion.
as
we
said
in
our
brief,
the
champion
did
not
abdicate
in
75;
the
champion
was
dethroned
in
72.
there
was
no
class
anymore.
what
the
court
of
appeals,
in
effect,
says,
that
class
denial
has
no
meaningful
effect
in
the
management
of
class-action
litigations,
because
with
whom
are
you
going
to
settle?
you
have
a
group,
a
finite
group;
you
have
interveners
who
came
in
here.
we
have
15
people
to
deal
with.
we
know
the
parameters
of
our
case;
we
know
what
we
are
subjected
to;
if
we
have
to
go
to
trial,
what
are
our
proof
problems;
what
are
our
defenses.
we
know
who
these
people
are,
because
we
are
talking
now
only
about
back
pay,
because
we
already
settled
the
legal
issue
of
liability
in
the
prior
litigation.
but
you
say,
”well,
you’ve
got
to
wait,
fellows.
you’ve
got
to
wait
until
this
is
all
over.”
mr.
stuart
bernstein
no,
sir,
it
would
be
identically
the
same,
and
that’s
the
issue
this
court
faced
in
american
pipe
--
should
it
make
a
difference
that
you
know
or
don’t
know
--
and
what
this
court
said
is,
“the
statute
will
toll
for
everybody.”
we
have
a
uniform,
clear
rule.
otherwise,
how
you
are
going
to
settle
these
things?
the
court
of
appeals’
test
is
purely
a
subjective
one;
when
did
you
know,
when
did
you
first
learn,
that
the
champion
of
the
class
is
going
to
advocate?
well,
are
you
going
to
have
a
hearing
on
that,
did
they
tell
me,
or
were
we
in
communication;
did
i
have
a
duty
to
communicate;
how
did
i
find
out;
did
i
happen
to
run
into
the
lawyer
in
the
street;
how
do
i
know
that?
your
rule
is
a
very
simple
rule;
once
class
is
denied,
the
clock
begins
to
run
again.
the
rule
proposed
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
an
unmanageable
rule.
we
simply
don’t
know.
we
have
to
have
another
evidentiary
hearing
on
how
did
we
find
out.
what
it
says
is
that
maybe
it
is
timely
for
some
class
members
and
not
for
others.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
that’s
present
--
that
is
going
to
be
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
there
is
some
question,
your
honor.
counsel,
i
think,
disagreed
with
me
as
to
the
size
of
the
class,
and
we
had
occasion
to
comment
in
our
brief
about
the
statements
about
how
large
the
class
really
is.
the
complaint
alleged
27
or
28,
but
he
claims
it
may
be
as
many
as
160.
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes,
sir?
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes,
sir,
i
believe
it
is.
i
believe
that
because
intervention
can
only
be
on
the
rule
24,
and
there
is
no
way
you
can
get
around
that.
when
you
talk
about
intervention
and
timeliness,
you
must
be
talking
about
rule
24.
either
intervention
is
a
matter
right
under
24(a)
or
permissive
under
24(b).
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes,
that’s
correct.
if
you’ll
examine
our
petition,
you’ll
see
that
we
do
allude
to
that
precise
point.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that’s
correct.
we
think
it
is
subsumed
in
it.
we
referred
to
justice
blackmun’s
comments
in
american
pipe
about
the
problem
of
sleeping
on
your
rights
and
using
this
as
a
vehicle.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
not
so,
sir.
if
ms.
mcdonald
had
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
may
i
be
heard,
sir?
the
group
that
we
are
talking
about
are
those
who
were
excluded.
if
they
were
within
the
parameters
that
the
judge
decided
was
an
appropriate
class,
but
failed
for
numerosity,
certainly
they
could
intervene,
as
the
13
did.
but
let’s
suppose
it's
one
of
those
who
was
excluded,
as
ms.
mcdonald
was.
then
she
comes
in
and
attempts
to
get
the
class
order
modified
which
lets
in
those
in
her
category,
in
her
subclass,
or
she
appeals
it
right
then,
because
it's
a
final
order.
certainly
there
could
be
review.
there
could
be
review
at
that
point.
if
miss
mcdonald
attempted
to
intervene
within
the
timely
period
and
that
intervention
was
denied
by
the
court
because
she
didn’t
come
within
the
parameters
of
the
group
as
he
defined
it,
she
can
appeal
that
and
the
reason
for
that
denial,
certainly.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
excuse
me,
sir.
it
is
not
appealable
by
the
main
parties;
but
attempted
interveners
who
were
denied
intervention
can
appeal,
and
that’s
what
happened
in
monarch
asphalt,
the
case
to
which
we
referred.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
the
denial
of
intervention,
but
that
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
the
reasons,
the
reasons
for
denial
of
intervention
either
are
you’re
too
late,
or
you’re
not
part
of
the
class.
if
it's
not
part
of
the
class,
we
have
to
examine
that.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
if
you
intervene
and
intervention
is
accepted,
that
is
correct.
but
if
you
are
denied
intervention,
you
appeal
the
denial
of
intervention;
and
if
you
were
denied
intervention
because
you
didn’t
come
within
the
group
that
the
judge
thought
was
permissible
to
be
in
that
suit,
you
then
have
appealed
the
judge’s
determination
of
that
question.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
the
fact
is
that
when
a
class
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes,
sir.
may
i
answer
it?
mr.
stuart
bernstein
when
the
class
action
is
started,
the
unnamed
people
are
in
the
same
position;
they
are
relying
on
what
somebody
else
is
going
to
do.
they
also
once
class
is
denied
have
the
obligation
to
protect
their
own
interests,
because
there’s
no
longer
a
class
vehicle,
and
the
named
plaintiffs
who
remain
have
no
fiduciary
obligation
to
the
unnamed
class
members.
the
charge
of
sellout,
sale
of
appeal
rights,
was
made
in
the
pearson
case,
made
by
the
sec
as
amicus,
and
the
court
rejected
that
on
the
ground
that
there
is
no
duty
anymore;
the
class
is
over,
it's
up
to
you
to
act
to
protect
yourself.
otherwise,
class
litigation
will
never
end.
it
will
go
on
indefinitely.
as
in
this
case
it
went
on
for
five
years,
it
will
go
on
another
five
and,
as
i
indicated
somebody
else
can
come
in
and
say,
“well,
you’ve
excluded
me,
too.”
there’s
simply
no
end.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
for
as
far
as
their
right
to
prosecute
the
appeal,
it
ended
it.
but,
i
don’t
think
that
their
decision
ended
our
opportunity
to
bring
this
case
to
its
conclusion.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
on
behalf
of
the
class,
it
was.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
and
i
can
say
to
him
that
the
class
exists
now,
because
the
seventh
circuit
ruled
it
did.
it's
a
metaphysical
discussion,
i
think,
to
say
that
for
three
years
there
was
a
class
originally,
then
for
three
years
it
ceased
to
exist,
and
now
it's
back
again.
i
think
the
only
way
to
look
at
it
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
they
wouldn’t
want
it.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
but
i
think
the
only
way
to
look
at
it
is,
once
the
seventh
circuit
has
ruled,
it’s,
i
suppose,
a
nunc
pro
tunc
order.
we’re
back
as
if
the
ruling
hadn’t
been
made,
the
erroneous
ruling
hadn’t
been
made
in
the
first
place.
i
suppose
that
if
you
look
at
this
kind
of
case
over
the
course
of
a
decade,
from
1968
to
1977,
you
wonder
if
there
isn’t
a
better
way
of
handling
this;
and
i
suppose
there
must
be,
because
i
don’t
think
a
case
should
go
on
this
long.
but
if
you
look
at
each
step
along
the
line,
i
think
you
can
explain
why
it
happened
that
ten
years
after
the
cause
of
action
arose,
we’re
still
in
a
court
and
we’re
a
long
way
from
a
remedy.
but
i
suggest
that
none
of
those
reasons
are
sufficient
to
hold
that
the
people
who
are
injured
by
united
airlines’
wrongdoing
should
never
get
appellate
review
of
an
erroneous
class
order,
and
they
should
never
get
the
relief
that
it
seems
to
me
they
have
been
entitled
to
for
the
last
decade.
it's
not
our
fault
that
we
are
here
today.
it's
not
our
fault
that
we
were
fired.
i
don’t
think
it’s
anybody’s
fault.
i
think
that
all
the
court
need
find,
as
the
seventh
circuit
did,
is,
we
have
acted
reasonably
in
light
of
what
we
knew
and
in
light
of
what
the
law
said
we
should
do,
and
i
suggest
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
