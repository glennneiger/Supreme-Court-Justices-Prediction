unknown
speaker
until
it
was
granted.
unknown
speaker
the
motion
to
strip
the
suit
of
its
class-action
character
was
granted.
unknown
speaker
and
then
class
status
denied,
that’s
fine.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
but
it
wasn’t
until
it
was
decided,
it
had
to
be.
unknown
speaker
before
you
start
on
that,
under
the
general
rule
of
american
pipe,
how
much
time
remained
after
the
denial
of
class-action
status?
how
much
time
under
the
applicable
statute
of
limitations?
unknown
speaker
62
days.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bernstein,
would
you
comment
somewhere
doing
your
argument
on
what
seems
to
me
some
difference
within
american
pipe
and
this
case,
in
that
in
american
pipe
all
the
courts
assumed
that
the
district
court’s
denial
of
class
certification
was
correct.
that
was
not
challenged,
and
here
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
the
denial
of
class
certification.
unknown
speaker
the
class
certification
was
denied
on
the
grounds
that
the
identifiable
plaintiffs
were
sufficiently
small
in
number,
the
class
action
wasn’t
warranted.
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean,
all
the
members
of
the
class
had
individually
appealed?
unknown
speaker
could
it
save
the
whole
class?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
person
can
move
to
intervene
in
a
lawsuit
that's
been
dead
ten
years
and
the
district
court
is
going
to
say
no,
and
that
person
has
a
right
to
appeal
from
that
denial
of
intervention.
the
answer
was
going
to
affirmed,
but
he
nonetheless
has
a
right
to
appeal.
unknown
speaker
and
the
question
is
also
whether
in
his
effort
to
intervene
late,
that
that
person
can
raise
any
other
issues
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
case
has
been
dead
so
long.
unknown
speaker
it
is
also
a
little
distinction
in
concept,
isn’t
it,
in
that
denial
of
a
motion
to
intervene
is
an
appealable
order
under
the
appropriate
provisions
of
28
u.s.c.?
so
you
don’t
say
that
the
district
court
is
without
power
to
entertain
it;
you
just
say
that
the
district
court
ought
never
to
grant
it.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question,
mr.
bernstein.
unknown
speaker
suppose
you
have
another
hypothetical
case
where
the
effort
to
intervene
is
five
years
after
a
settlement
and
the
district
court
says,
“no,
you
can’t
intervene.”
is
the
proper
reason
for
that
decision
simply
a
weighing
of
timeliness
factors
under
the
rule,
or
is
it
that,
in
fact,
there
is
no
case
in
which
to
intervene?
unknown
speaker
but
you
can’t
appeal
until
you
intervene,
can
you?
unknown
speaker
so
isn’t
there
something
what
judge
pell
said
about
if
she
was
going
to
get
in,
she
had
to
get
in
by
a
motion
to
alter
or
amend
the
judgment?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
misunderstood
you.
you
can
appeal
if
you’re
denied
intervention.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
clear
that
intervention
must
take
place
before
the
running
of
statute
of
limitations
on
the
original
cause
of
action?
unknown
speaker
what
about
when
a
case
is
on
appeal?
unknown
speaker
you
can
intervene
when
a
case
is
on
appeal.
unknown
speaker
would
your
argument
be
the
same
if
the
respondent
here
had
filed
an
affidavit
and
said,
“i
didn’t
know
what
happened
to
the
case”?
unknown
speaker
it's
whether
or
not
it’s
a
controllable
size
of
class
with
20-something
people.
unknown
speaker
you
could
have
been
required
to
notify
them.
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
ask
mr.
bernstein
first
about
that.
unknown
speaker
does
your
question
as
presented
in
your
petition,
you
presented
only
one
question,
didn’t
you?
that
was
the
american
pipe
question.
unknown
speaker
does
the
question
of
the
timeliness
of
intervention,
is
that
subsumed
in
this?
unknown
speaker
that’s
why
you
didn’t
expressly
present
that.
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
did.
but
there
is
only
the
single
question
and
effective
--
unknown
speaker
of
course
if
you’re
right,
mr.
bernstein.
i
suppose
there
could
never
be
any
review
of
the
propriety
of
the
denial
of
class
status,
because
if
two
or
three
members
of
the
class
had
intervened
promptly
in
a
timely
fashion
within
the
62
days,
you
would
have
just
settled
with
them,
and
then
nobody
would
appeal…
unknown
speaker
…
the
way
you
settled
with
the
original
plaintiffs.
unknown
speaker
well,
generally
speaking
the
grant
or
the
denial
of
class
action
is
non-appealable
until
after
a
final
judgment.
unknown
speaker
appealed
the
denial
of
intervention.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
that
is
automatically
appealing
the
non-inclusion
in
the
class.
unknown
speaker
but
of
course
if
you
intervene,
you
don’t
need
to
be
part
of
the
class.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
happens
to
a
member
of
the
class
who
knows
he
is
a
member
of
the
class
and
knows
the
lawsuit’s
there
and,
without
his
knowledge
at
all,
the
champion
tells
the
defendant,
“if
you’ll
give
me
twice
what
i
asked
for,
i
will
not
oppose
the
denial
of
the
class-action
point”
and
then
the
non-champion
doesn’t
hear
anything
about
that
he
really
gets
it,
doesn’t
he?
unknown
speaker
how
could
he
stop
that?
unknown
speaker
of
course.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
bernstein.
mr.
meites?
unknown
speaker
you
could
have
just
brought
your
own
lawsuit
as
individual
plaintiffs,
couldn’t
you?
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
you
said.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
that
would
have
been
what
the
members
of
the
class
in
american
pipe
did.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
you
originally
said
was,
you
had
no
choice,
you
couldn’t
do
that,
and
i
didn’t
understand
what
--
unknown
speaker
you
said
you
had
no
alternative
but
to
do
what
you
actually
did
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
after
the
62
days
had
elapsed.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
doesn’t
give
you
any
rights.
i’m
sorry,
but
you
can't
do
anything
else.
unknown
speaker
that
doesn’t
give
you
any
right
to
do
so.
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
understand
why
didn’t
you
try
to
intervene.
unknown
speaker
and
that
failed.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
didn’t
they
during
those
four
years
intervene?
unknown
speaker
now,
is
competent
counsel
counsel
that
let
somebody
else
do
the
work?
unknown
speaker
and
she
could
have
appealed.
unknown
speaker
which
is
what
she
is
trying
to
do
now.
unknown
speaker
if
she
sought
intervention
and
had
intervened,
had
been
permitted
to
intervene
…
unknown
speaker
but
she
could
have
filed
the
petition
to
intervene
and
had
it
denied.
unknown
speaker
but
she
wouldn’t
have
been
in
it
with
them.
unknown
speaker
how
could
she
spin
the
words
off
and
not
gotten
anything?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
what’s
the
natural
…
unknown
speaker
mr.
meites,
you
say
that
the
client
you
now
represent
then
was
actually
represented
by
the
romasanta
lawyers?
unknown
speaker
no
formal
engagement.
i
would
think
otherwise,
she
might
certainly
have
a
claim
against
them.
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
assuming
that
the
application
to
intervene
took
place
before
the
entry
of
a
final
judgment
when
you
advert
to
naacp
v.
new
york,
aren’t
you?
there
is
a
law,
it
seems
to
me,
that
you
put
your
intervener
in
a
little
more
favorable
position
than
you
do
your
party
when
you
say
that
if
a
party
gets
a
judgment
on
the
merits,
part
of
which
she
likes
and
part
of
which
she
doesn’t,
he
has
30
days,
no
ifs,
ands
or
buts,
to
appeal
the
disadvantageous
part
to
the
court
of
appeals.
you
are
saying
in
effect
that
an
intervener
who
is
in
the
same
position
as
that
party
can
come
in
five
years
later
and
under
kind
of
a
flexible
timeliness
standard
get
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
same
kind
of
issue.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
that
even
if
you’d
come
in
5
years
later,
you
would
not
be
barred
by
the
30-day
rule.
unknown
speaker
but
doesn’t
it
really
come
down
to
…
put
it
this
way.
american
pipe
was
concerned
with
the
question
of
what
tolling
effect,
if
any,
the
pendency
of
an
alleged
class
action
that
was
later
not
certified
as
a
class
action,
what
tolling
effect
it
had
upon
the
statute
of
limitations.
that
was
the
question
in
american
pipe.
here,
isn’t
the
first
question
to
be
asked
is
whether
or
not
intervention
has
to
take
place
within
the
period
provided
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
and
does
it
or
doesn’t
it,
the
rule
24
just
says
“timely”.
unknown
speaker
it
says
“timely”,
doesn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
an
individual
plaintiff’s
case.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
law
on
this
…
unknown
speaker
it
is
like,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
preliminary
and
dispositive
question.
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
it
did
in
american
pipe,
because
these
were
…
these
unnamed-class
people
who
were
held
not
to
be
a
class,
only
because
they
were
not
…
the
class
was
not
too
numerous,
came
in
as
original
plaintiffs,
and
they
virtually
conceded
that
they
had
to
come
in
within
the
period,
within
the
limitations’
period;
and
the
question
was,
how
much
of
that
period
had
been
tolled.
that
was
the
only
question.
unknown
speaker
and
they,
as
i
say,
as
i
remember
in
that
case,
it
was
conceded
that
they
had
to
come
in
within
the
limitations’
period
as
original
plaintiffs.
but
is
it
generally
true
that
there
has
to
be
intervention
within
the
appropriate
limitations’
period?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
could
be
after
judgment,
but
still
within
the
limitations
period.
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
remember
much
discussion,
either.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
that
really
the
first
question
to
ask
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
rule
24
just
says
“timely”.
unknown
speaker
if
a
plaintiff
and
a
defendant
agree
to
enter
into
a
settlement
agreement
and
stipulate
that
the
complaint
can
be
dismissed
or
that
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois
the
plaintiff
can
appeal
from
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i’ve
never
heard
of
anybody’s
suggesting
that
someone
who
has
settled
and
entered
into
a
stipulation
for
dismissal
of
his
complaint
upon
receipt
of
a
sum
of
money
and
get
that
sum
of
money
could
appeal.
unknown
speaker
but
they
didn’t
agree.
unknown
speaker
the
fact
is,
they
did
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
that
all
that’s
necessary?
unknown
speaker
well,
who
was
that,
the
class?
unknown
speaker
but
according
to
mr.
bernstein,
the
class
didn’t
exist
anymore.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
only
reason
it’s
back
again
is
because
you’re
putting
it
back.
they’re
not
putting
it
back.
unknown
speaker
that’s
the
last
thing
they
want
to
do.
