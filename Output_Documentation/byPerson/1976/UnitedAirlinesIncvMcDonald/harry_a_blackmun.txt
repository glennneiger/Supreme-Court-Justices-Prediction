your
position
necessarily
would
require
persons
having
claims
to
flood
into
the
district
court
at
that
time.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
one
means
is
to
wait
for
the
named
parties
to
take
an
appeal
from
the
denial
of
the
class
certification.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
but
that’s
a
risk
he
takes,
and
if
he
stands
by
and
there
is
an
appeal
taken,
he
benefits
by
that
appeal.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
all
i
am
saying
is
that
doesn’t
your
position
mean
that
these
interveners
must
flood
into
the
court

it
under
an

justice
harry
a.
blackmun
…
intervener.

you
want
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
isn’t
the
very
thing
…
well,
i
ask,
is
it
the
very
thing?
isn’t
what
she
wants
here
is
the
ability
to
appeal
the
denial
of
the
class
certification
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
not
to
intervene.
