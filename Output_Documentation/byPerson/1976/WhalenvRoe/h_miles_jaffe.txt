mr.
h.
miles
jaffe
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
could
go
back
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question,
we
do
admit
that
it
is
the
difference
in
the
extent
and
intrusiveness
of
the
system
that
is
the
heart
of
this
case,
and
the
case
really
does
not
take
off
from
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
powell
in
the
shultz
case,
where
he
says
“at
some
point
governmental
intrusion
upon
these
areas
would
implicate
legitimate
expectations
of
privacy.”
the
key
to
this
case
is
that
unlike
the
decisions
in
danforth
or
in
shultz
where
the
reporting
was
not
systematic
and
in
fact
was
not
properly
challenged
or
as
in
the
american
physicians
case
which
was
affirmed
by
this
court
in
the
last
term
but
not
heard
by
this
court.
there
is
systematic
reporting
here
of
the
names
of
literally
hundreds
and
thousands
of
patients.
it
is
our
belief,
there
comes
a
point
at
which
the
demand
of
the
state
for
systematic
reporting
of
absolutely
innocent
conduct
becomes
offensive,
and
in
fact
the
intrusiveness
of
the
conduct
was
seen
at
trial,
because
as
mr.
lesch’s
comment
this
case
went
up
and
down,
originally
judge
carter
thought
there
was
not
substantial
federal
question.
it
was
reversed
by
the
second
circuit.
it
came
back
down.
we
asked
for
a
temporary
injunction
and
the
court
said,
no
you
have
not
shown
us
any
real
injury,
but
when
we
finally
got
to
trial
the
witnesses
who
testified,
testified
to
substantial
intrusion
into
the
doctor-patient
relationship
which
is
a
part
of
this
case.
it
is
the
intimacy
of
the
information
that
government
is
seeking
part
of
the
doctor-patient
relationship.
witnesses
testified
--
these
witnesses
it
is
true
were
innocent
of
past
practices
but
they
testified
that
the
thought
of
having
the
state
have
all
this
information
made
them
very
uneasy
or
a
doctor
testified
that
he
would
not
prescribe
for
his
schizophrenic
in
one
case.
i
think
that
is
page
169
in
record
dr.
bernice’s
testimony,
he
would
not
prescribe
for
his
schizophrenic
patient
these
drugs
because
as
all
the
other
doctors
testified,
he
felt
he
was
required
to
inform
the
patient
that
the
system
existed
and
him
name
would
be
forward
to
albany.
he
then
felt
that
he
is
so
informed
this
schizophrenic
that
would
upset
the
very
treatment
which
he
in
fact
intended
to
prescribe
for
the
schizophrenic.
so,
here
we
are
asking
the
court
to
address
itself
to
the
questions
which
were
not
raised
in
danforth
or
miller
where
there
was
investigation.
but
the
question
where
there
is
in
effect
the
dragnet
before
and
not
in
investigation
afterward
and
that
is
the
distinction.
it
is
fine
for
the
state
to
investigate
and
we
are
for
it
and
we
do
not
believe
that
drug
abuse
is
a
good
thing
we
can
say
it
is
a
bad
thing.
now,
we
think
doctors
should
have
to
report
and
we
do
think
that
doctors
should
in
fact
--
the
computer
can
print
out
exactly
what
the
doctor’s
uses.
that
is
to
say
if
one
doctor
is
prescribing
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pills
a
month
that
whatever
would
be
the
right,
a
quantum.
you
can
then
go
and
investigate
that
doctor
and
the
doctor
is
requiring
a
statute,
and
we
do
not
objected
it,
the
doctor
is
requiring
the
statute
to
keep
those
records
and
then
when
the
state
goes
and
conducts
the
investigation.
mr.
h.
miles
jaffe
and
does
not
here,
and
that
is
not
challenged
in
this
case.
what
is
challenged
in
this
case
is
the
centralization
and
the
data
processing
implications
that
are
taking
place.
in
this
case
whether
it
be
medical
information,
the
next
we
will
have
is
income,
in
the
valeo
case
we
have
political
contributions
for
which
a
reason
was
found
there
which
we
think
was
compelling.
the
difference
here
is
that
the
state’s
showing
is
totally
inadequate.
we
may,
the
next
case
we
may
get
is
the
filing
of
first
of
all
fingerprints
which
is
true,
if
we
ask
any
single
citizen
to
come
forward
at
anytime
we
could
probably
get
his
fingerprints.
it
is
a
systematic,
dragnet,
prior
to
any
criminal
conduct.
we
have
totally
innocent
patients
here
who
are
compelled
to
be
part
of
the
system.
no
one
goes
to
get
a
schedule
ii
drug
because
he
wants
to
be
happy
about
it.
he
is
a
patient
and
he
is
presumably
sick.
mr.
h.
miles
jaffe
but
why
not
draw
the
line
before
that.
why
not
say
no
registration
of
birth
certificate?
mr.
h.
miles
jaffe
because
the
registration
of
birth
certificate
has
a
clear
need.
mr.
h.
miles
jaffe
your
honor,
that
is
not
as
hard
as
your
honor
makes
it
sound.
in
fact,
usually
the
states
can
show
a
very
clear
reason
for
spending
millions
of
dollars
taking
in
125,000
prescriptions
per
month,
and
in
fact
the
need
in
the
gunshot
case
and
the
need
in
the
venereal
disease
those
needs
are
clear.
but
that
comes
at
times
when
we’re
dealing
with
medical
records,
when
the
need
--
and
in
this
case
we
get
to
that
point.
this
case
was
a
tried,
this
case
does
not
come
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
does
not
come
up
on
summary
judgment.
it
comes
up
after
three
judges,
originally
rather
skeptical,
heard
the
testimony
of
these
patients
and
what
they
said
was,
in
a
year
or
twenty
months
that
this
system
was
in
effect,
we
had
one
case
in
which
there
is
a
suspect.
there
has
not
been
any
showing
that
this
system
has
acted
as
a
deterrent.
we
have
no
showing
at
all
of
any
need
here
and
what
we
preserve
as
we
rule
against
the
name
requirement
we
preserve
it
is
the
most
comprehensive
system
of
regulation
of
any
drug
regulation
in
the
country,
namely
everything
must
be
filled
on,
on
a
new
york
state
form,
it
must
include
--
mr.
h.
miles
jaffe
yes,
i
mean
there
is
--
mr.
h.
miles
jaffe
sure,
it
does
make
a
difference,
because
most
people
recognize
this
point
as
the
possibility
of
use.
if
the
in
fact
information
is
centralized
within
the
control
of
the
government.
it
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
h.
miles
jaffe
no,
in
other
words
he
is
worried
about
the
fact
that
he
takes
a
dangerous
drug
and
he
says
while
i
may
run
for
office
next
year,
and
the
governor
in
the
state
in
fact
can
simply
push
the
button
on
the
computer
and
find
out,
among
other
things,
who
my
business
associates
are
because
we
have
a
list
of
those
people
and
who
my
drugs
are
because
we
have
list
of
those
people.
in
other
words
that
this
court
would
not
find
--
mr.
h.
miles
jaffe
well,
yes
the
governor
could
carry
out
an
extensive
investigation.
mr.
h.
miles
jaffe
yes,
but
the
facility
here
--
it
is
true
that
--
mr.
h.
miles
jaffe
it
is
easier
to
push
the
computer
button
and
find
out
where
all
of
our
citizens
have
been
and
what
all
our
citizens
do
and
who
their
associations
are
and
who
their
political
contributions
are
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
but
are
we
going
to
answer
the
state
to
make
a
collection
of
political
contribution
without
a
showing
that
in
fact
there
is
a
reason
to
that.
mr.
h.
miles
jaffe
that
would
be
exactly
on
point
your
honor.
i
would
say
if
that
if
federal
income
tax
will
not
necessary
then
we
should
not
have
the
forms.
we
all
know
it
is
necessary
and
therefore
we
do
not
object
it.
mr.
h.
miles
jaffe
yes
i
do,
but
here
we
have
a
showing
after
trial
which
is
the
difference
in
this
case
that
the
state
has
gotten
literally
nothing
after
trial,
shown
nothing
as
the
(inaudible),
and
we
say
as
mr.
justice
powell
implicated
into
the
shultz
case,
there
comes
a
point
when
the
material
turned
up
by
a
system
which
includes
hundreds
of
thousands
of
prescriptions
per
month
almost
when
it
is
going
too
far,
and
as
your
honor
points
out
where
you
find
any
immediate
need
as
in
the
income
tax
area.
we
would
then
uphold
the
system,
where
for
example,
you
might
even
fill
in
the
income
tax
place
you
went
too
far
as
in
requiring
everybody
to
report
every
check
that
he
has
and
it
is
true
that
the
irs
could
get
every
check.
but
we
would
still
not
want
the
government
to
have
a
record
of
every
check,
and
checks
or
less
personal
if
one
looks
at
most
than
are
the
medical
records
of
people
here.
interestingly
in
the
danforth
case,
in
the
shultz
case
and
in
the
association
of
american
physicians,
none
of
the
regulations
required
the
centralized
reporting
of
names.
thus
the
statute
of
danforth
does
not
require
the
central
reporting,
and
the
regulations
do
not
include
on
the
form
the
name.
that
is
the
distinction
that
we
called
to
the
court’s
attention
an
urge,
and
we
urge
the
court
to
examine
carefully
the
findings
of
the
lower
court
and
their
narrowness
perhaps
not
the
language
but
the
narrowness
of
that
point,
which
said
where
there
is
no
product
from
the
system
and
where
the
system
is
requiring
the
massive
centralization
there
we
think
that
the
diminution
of
constitutionally
protected
right
is
too
great.
or
put
otherwise,
when
you
have
regulation
of
this
sort
precision
must
be
touched
up.
thank
you.
