justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
lesch,
did
you
challenge
or
do
you
now
question
the
constitutionality
of
the
record
keeping
requirement
that
a
physician
who
prescribed
these
drugs,
keep
those
records
or
in
his
office
and
that
those
records
to
be
opened
to
inspection
by
the
state
of
new
york?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
concede
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
all
of
your
constitutionally
boils
down
towards
that
if
that
is
made
easier
through
modern
technology
for
the
state
of
new
york
to
enforce
this
law,
there
is
the
constitutional
difference.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
wait
a
minute,
wait
a
minute
mr.
lesch,
you
cannot
that
just
as
be
taken
into
evidence
the
system
is
working
very
well
that
it
is
in
fact
deterring
views
of
the
things.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
wait
a
minute,
this
is
your
constitutional
argument
than
turn
not
on
the
fact
that
you
have
to
turn
--
the
doctor
has
to
turn
the
records
over
to
authorized
new
york
personnel,
but
on
the
further
fact
that
there
maybe
leakage
to
unauthorized
persons.
