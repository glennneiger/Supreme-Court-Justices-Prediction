mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
which
declared
unconstitutional
enjoined
the
operation
of
three
sections
of
the
new
york
public
health
law
contained
an
article
33
of
that
law
which
deals
with
controlled
substances,
dangerous
drugs,
and
alike.
actually,
only
section
3332
(2)
(a)
is
involved.
that
is
the
provision
that
requires
that
on
filed
official
new
york
state
descriptions,
the
names
and
addresses
of
patients
be
contained
thereon,
and
be
filed
with
the
new
york
state
department
of
health
whose
commissioner
is
the
appellant
herein.
the
district
court
enjoined
this
statute
on
the
basis
that
this
provision
was
an
invasion
on
privacy
of
the
appellees
who
are
anonymous,
basically
anonymous
patients
and
known
doctors.
i
would
allude
to
the
operation
of
the
other
sections
which
were
enjoined.
they
require
the
use
of
the
official
new
york
state
description
in
prescribing
these
certain
dangerous
drugs,
and
this
applies
to
doctors
and
pharmacist
in
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
basically,
yes.
as
it
was
in
the
prior
law
under
this
triplicate
prescription
system,
one
copy
of
the
prescription
is
kept
by
the
doctor
if
he
self
dispenses
the
drug
or
the
pharmacist
who
fills
that
description.
so
therefore,
the
doctor
or
pharmacist
does
have
to
keep
these
records
and
the
statute
so
provides
for
a
period
of
five
years
they
have
to
keep
these
records.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
no,
and
indeed
the
district
court
in
one
of
its
prior
decision,
i
think
even
decision
that
resulted
in
the
judgment,
stated
that
the
appellees
conceded
the
constitutionality
of
the
prior
requirements
of
law.
i
would
only
point
out
of
course
that
not
being
an
issue,
that
provision
or
requirement
not
being
an
issue
certainly
at
this
time.
it
is
nothing
else,
it
is
presumed
constitutional,
it
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
now
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
oh,
yes
of
course,
yes
right.
the
name
of
the
patient
under
the
prior
law,
and
this
is
at
least
for
40
years,
was
available
to
the
new
york
state
department
of
health.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
upon
demand
or
basically
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
periodic
inspection
of
pharmacist’s
file
of
prescription
records.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
would
say
that
what
the
law
request
requires
is
that
it
be
each
month
the
(inaudible)
file
were
sent
up
to
the
department
of
health
in
albany.
i
would,
at
this
point,
like
to
point
out,
the
computerization
is
not
a
requirement
of
law
and
administrative
operation.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
i
think
the
requirements
of
filing
and
i
think,
at
this
point,
what
was
the
purpose
of
requiring
filing
in
triplicate
descriptions.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
oh
yes,
they
have
a
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
am
not
aware
but
i
believe
that
it
had
a
general
variety
of
medical
reporting
statutes
such
as
gunshot
wounds,
venereal
disease,
contagious
diseases
and
alike,
and
i
do
not
believe
it
is
up
to
the
file
because
it
is
rather
obvious
they
serve
a
public
health
need
as
does
this
filing
statute
also,
and
this
is
the
question
of
purpose.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes.
i
think
that
the
purpose
is
rather
obvious.
number
one,
it
is
only
for
a
certain
type
of
dangerous
and
high
performing
drugs
that
is
called
the
schedule
ii
drug
which
have
been
found
to
be
forming
psychologically
dependent
attitude
and
alike.
it
does
not
cover
the
whole
spectrum
of
prescription
prescribing.
the
state
of
new
york
is
not
engaging
in
some
wholesale
supervision
of
the
practice
of
medicine.
we
do
not
even
know
what
elements
are
involved
here.
it
only
concerns
narcotic
and
amphetamine-type
drugs
where
the
danger
or
abuse
of
the
public
health,
danger
to
the
public
health
is
greatest.
now,
it
has
been
conceded
in
the
decision
i
think
my
adversary
is
that
abuse
in
diversion
of
these
type
of
drugs
from
legitimate
channels
is
a
serious
problem,
and
indeed
there
is
a
serious
problem
in
this
area
of
misapplication
of
what
i
say,
‘medical
principles’.
a
lot
of
these
drugs
are
prescribed
by
doctor
studies
have
been
made
for
causing
medical
uses
for
rather
fallacious
reasons.
further,
i
would
submit
that
--
or
i
think
it
is
rather
obvious
that
inclusion
of
the
names
and
addresses
on
the
file
prescriptions
do
assist
in
deterring
and
exposing
prescriptions
which
are
not
within
the
law.
they
assist
in
investigations.
in
this
area,
the
state
of
new
york
is
exercising
its
police
power
in
the
interest
of
the
public
health
and
safety.
it
is
regulating
the
use
of
dangerous
drugs,
those
which
are
habit-forming
which
it
has
for
over
fifty
years
since
i
cite
the
whipple
v.
martinson
case,
then
recognized
by
this
court,
it
is
clearly
within
a
state
of
power
that
discretion
and
the
control
of
this
type
of
dangerous
drug.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
that
is
quite
clear
and
obvious,
even
from
the
decision
below,
it
tried
to
explain
away
the
reasons
for
names
and
addresses
on,
say,
basis
of
number
of
fallacious
assumptions,
and
i
would
say
of
course
it
was
the
true
primary
purpose
perhaps
of
the
filing
to
identify
a
patient
going
from
doctor
to
doctor
and
receiving,
say,
even
from
one
or
more
doctors
in
over
30
days
supply,
but
that
was
not
the
only
purpose,
and
i
would
emphasize
that
the
appellant
never
conceded
that
it
was.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
that
is
part
of
the
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
quite
clearly,
it
would
catch
that
type
of
violation
and
having
the
names
and
addresses
of
that
doctors
and
patients
would
be
quite
valuable
in
the
investigation
of
that
doctor’s
activities.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
would
say
--
now
the
question
i
think
--
i
am
not
that
well
acquainted
with
the
case
of
dr.
moore
but
i
would
emphasize
that
the
case
--
i
just
cite
a
similar
type
of
case
that
did
not
reach
this
court,
united
states
v.
warren.
it
takes
months
and
months
of
laborious
investigation
to
build
a
case
against
the
doctor
like
this
one,
some
of
the
activities
of
this
type
of
doctor
so
well-known
they
printed
up
in
the
newspapers.
the
point
being
that
filing
with
names
and
addresses
so
we
know
who
are
the
patients,
the
supposed
patient
you
might
say,
obviously
enables
the
enforcement
authorities
to
much
more
quickly
bring
proceedings
against
that
type
of
doctor
to
have
a
full
picture
of
this
type
of
activities
to
better
control
this
illegal
activity.
let
us
put
it
quite
bluntly
because
this
has
been
the
record.
so,
deter
this
activity
from
taking
place
this
type
of
medical
practice
not
within
any
ethical
principles
from
either
taking
place
in
the
first
place.
now,
as
i
said,
we
do
have
--
and
it
is
rather
obvious
that
the
problem
or
the
situation,
i
will
say
the
situation
of
a
patient,
it
is
a
bogus
patient
basically,
going
from
one
doctor
to
another
to
obtain
this
type
of
dangerous
drug.
if
he
goes
from
doctor
to
doctor,
there
is
really
no
conceivable
way
that
this
type
of
activity
is
going
to
be
exposed
unless
you
have
patient’s
names
and
addresses
because
you
correlate
the
patient’s…
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
now
that
assumes
that
that
patient,
that
person
is
going
to
violate
another
section
of
the
law.
we
have
a
prohibition
against
of
course
using
false
names
or
fraud
in
deception,
and
so
just
simple
assume
that
that
type
of
person
is
going
to
violate
one
law,
two
laws,
three
laws,
i
think
it
simply
specious.
there’s
no
answer
to
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
my
answer
to
you
is
that
this
court
a
number
of
years
ago
held
that
the
condition
of
being
a
drug
addict
is
not
a
crime.
i
believe
that
was
in…
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
certainly
that
is
the
case.
we
cannot
assume
that
every
single
person
is
going
around,
using
all
types
of
things,
and
i
would
also
say
that
if
a
doctor
is
doing
his
job,
he
might
say
or
practicing
medicine
properly,
there
are
many
situations
where
a
patient
or
a
person
coming
around
who
just
cannot
use
a
false
name.
many
times
these
people
are
on
medicare
or
medicaid.
obviously
there
are
other
ways
to
check.
the
use
of
a
false
name
would
expose
their
type
of
activity
even
more
quickly.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
will
also
state
that
when
i
am
from
new
york
city
and
that
when
i
go
to
my
doctor,
after
i
go
-
and
this
is
i
think
a
typical
procedure
-
a
bill
is
mailed
to
me.
that
bill
did
not
get
to
me,
the
doctor
would
be
put
on
some
notice
that
something
is
out
of
touch.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
that
may
be
another
thing
we
would
like
to
investigate
in
this
case
because
what
we
find
a
lot
of
times
is
these
doctors
who
are
engaged
in
this
type
of
activity
do
not
keep
medical
records.
indeed,
the
triplicate
prescription
with
the
names
and
address
may
be
the
only
record
of
what
is
going
on
in
this
doctor’s
practice
or
so-called
practice.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
when
you
talk
about
schedule
ii
drugs,
they
are
in
part
narcotics.
if
you
talk
about
hardcore
narcotics,
the
three
drugs
such
as
say,
heroin
that
is
in,
what
is
called,
the
schedule
i
absolutely
prohibited
because
there
is
no
record
of
use.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
however,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
-
and
we
did
not
make
an
issue
of
it
in
this
case.
yes,
the
schedule
ii
drugs
do
have
recognized
medical
uses
but
even
these
recognized
medical
uses
are
subject
to
great
disputes.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
more
than
before
i
started
in
this
case.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
absolutely
not,
we
make
no
judgments
or
we
do
not
look
over
the
doctor’s
shoulder
before
he
prescribes
a
drug.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
that
is
correct.
these
drugs
do
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
i
would
say
morphine
would
be
one
type.
that
is
a
narcotic
type
drug.
for
example,
i
believe
an
amphetamine
type
one
which
is
quite
frequent
in
this
case,
one
called
ritalin
which
has
several
uses.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
morphine,
yes
morphine
is
included.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
as
a
title
ii
drug,
because
morphine
is
an
opium
derivative
and
habit
forming
and
dangerous.
it
is
not
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
think
it
is
clearly
within
the
police
power
of
the
state
to
control
these
drugs
and
part
of
the
control
is
the
method
of
distribution
and
the
distribution
is
ultimate
use
of
this
part.
now,
if
i
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
no,
basically
and
it
is
in
the
legislative
history,
this
law
is
not
designed
to
control
perhaps
the
most
serious
problem
of
street
drugs.
this
statute
is
designed
to
control
or
better
regulate
the
problem
of
diversion
from
apparently
legitimate
sources.
now
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
i
think
quite
seriously
they
will
be
in
great
jeopardy
and
perhaps
more
important
than
i
--
i
think
it
was
my
first
point
about
the
bad
policy
of
a
finding
a
doctor-patient
relationship
been
in
of
itself
as
a
fundamental
interest
is
that
as
i
think
your
honors
are
all
aware,
the
doctor-patient
privilege
finds
its
expression
in
law
in
confidentialities
provided
for
only
in
state
laws,
new
york
does
provide
for
doctor-patient
testimonial
confidentiality.
now,
it
was
not
known
even
at
common
law,
and
indeed
there
are
many
variations
on
this
privilege
and
furthermore,
commentators
have
criticized
the
privilege
because
many
times
it
prevents
courts
from
getting
at
the
truth.
what
it
should
be
emphasized
is
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
medical
treatment
for
there
to
be
a
confidential
relationship
between
doctor
and
patient.
i
think
this
case
demonstrates
that.
there
are
allegations
or
i
would
say
the
record
shows
the
testimony
of
the
patients,
that
they
stopped
using
schedule
ii
because
of
the
filing
requirement.
well,
let
us
look
at
what
happens.
a
patient
goes
to
the
doctor,
he
tells
the
doctor
what
ails
him,
the
doctor
than
makes
a
diagnosis
and
determines
on
a
course
of
treatment,
in
its
complete
discretion
or
his
decision,
he
may
decide
on
a
schedule
ii
drug,
and
it
only
at
that
point
does
he
write
a
prescription,
how
i
ask
you
had
the
practice
of
medicine
been
interfered
with.
the
practice
of
medicine
has
not
been
interfered
with.
in
the
30
years
there
is
no
record
of
it
in
california,
the
15
years
in
illinois,
and
i
think
about
10
or
12
years
in
idaho
with
the
same
type
of
filing
and
reporting
has
been
enforced.
now,
as
we
said,
i
said
the
problem
of
situation
is
doctor
to
doctor.
now,
as
to
patients
what
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
the
patients
who
gets
from
a
doctor
an
over
30-day
supply,
now
this
would
more
probably
be
the
abuse
of
the
patient
by
the
doctor.
now,
obviously
we
can
still
printout
as
we
do,
we
could
still
printout
prescriptions,
anonymous
prescriptions
--
there
is
anonymous
list
of
patients
that
contain
over
30-day
supply
which
is
a
violation
of
the
law.
however,
what
we
can
not
know
is,
is
this
one
person
receiving
the
multiple
prescriptions
from
the
same
doctor
or
what?
all
we
can
do
now
is
get
a
list
of
perhaps
a
hundred,
a
thousand
of
these
types
of
prescriptions
to
come
through
each
month
and
send
out
investigators
back
to
the
drugstore
to
find
out
who
was
the
patient
to
find
out
which
are
the
most
serious
cases
of
abuse.
it
is
absolutely
impossible
to
do
with
24
investigators
in
the
whole
state
of
new
york.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
as
quite
specifically
under
the
triplicate
prescription
law,
a
doctor
is
limited
to
prescribing
a
30-day
supply
with
several
exceptions,
i
believe,
some
of
the
drugs
with
children,
i
think
i
believe
the
ritalin
they
maybe
able
to
prescribe
the
3-month
supply,
but
basically
there
is
a
limitation
of
a
30-day
supply.
in
point
of
fact
the
exception
for
i
think
3-month
would
depend
on
knowing
the
age
which
we
are
trying
to
be
reported
and
the
drug
and
the
patient,
for
example,
to
know
whether
that
was
being
complied
with.
now,
another
point
or
another
purpose
is
that
basically
filing
a
triplicate
prescription
with
patient
names
heightens
the
doctor’s
awareness
to
the
status
of
his
patients.
there
is
of
course,
and
it
was
said
--
well
defense
lawyer
has
no
application
to
addicts,
which
is
true,
in
the
sense
that
the
law
prohibits
prescribing
this
type
of
schedule
ii
dangerous
drugs
to
addicts
and
the
habitual
users.
but
how
are
we
going
to
know
whether
that
is
being
complied
with
unless
we
know
or
have
some
record
of
who
are
receiving
them.
another
major
problem
i
would
submit
is,
if
the
names
and
addresses
are
missing
from
the
filed
prescriptions,
a
doctor
could
prescribe
for
himself
with
little
danger
of
detection.
he
could
use
false
names,
his
own
name,
whatever
name
he
feels
like.
he
could
make
sure
it
is
within
under
30-day
supply
because
he
has
these
matters.
i
would
also
say,
and
it
is
rather
obvious
from
your
own
cases
i
think
the
moore
case
which
i
am
not
acquainted
with
that
there
are
unscrupulous
doctors
and
pharmacists
who
are
basically
dispenses
a
drug
at
will.
now
and
finally
you
have
the
question
of
forgery.
now
it
is
true
the
computer
cannot
in
and
of
itself
identify
a
name
as
a
forgery
but,
and
this
is
of
course
i
think
which
cases
have
come
up.
usually
forgeries
when
you
have
a
forgery,
the
person
who
is
using
a
false
name
does
it
in
a
rather
large
amount,
just
like
when
you
print
up
counterfeit
money
you
do
it
in
the
amount
to
make
it
worthwhile,
and
normally
because
it
is
a
false
name
it
is
a
same
name.
now,
if
we
do
not
know
the
name
there
is
no
way
to,
say,
send
out
the
alert
that
someone
using
the
name
of
such
and
such
is
active
in
your
area,
if
you
get
a
prescription
in
that
name.
this
alert
can
be
sent
out
to
the
druggists.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
it
could
be
either
way.
it
could
be
possibly
in
the
true
name
of
the
patient
and
with
a
forged
doctor’s
signature
or
to
be
a
false
name
with
a
true
doctor’s
signature.
it
could
be
any
number
of
things.
the
point
is
there
are
complex
variations.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well
i
think
and
the
point
is
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
not
certainly.
that
sums
to
the
question
that
the
district
court
seemed
to
consider
the
fact
that
because
we
had
not
gotten
enough
results
here
that
somehow
it
then
became
unconstitutional
that
if
we
had
a
good
record
of
results
in
this
area
if
we
produce
enough
cases
defenders
would
become
constitutional.
i
submit
that
this
is
not
the
test
of
constitutionality
that
this
court
has
clearly
stated
the
case
in
other
similar
situations
such
as
i
think
the
danforth
case
that
the
filing
or
reporting
requirement
is
reasonably
directed
to
the
preservation
of
health.
i
submit
that
this
type
of
filing
requirement
clearly
is
so
related.
now,
i
also
want
to
take
up
very
briefly.
my
time
has
almost
expired.
that
filing
clearly
does
not
interfere
with
the
doctor-patient
relationship,
and
i
submit
that
the
doctor-patient
relationship
is
not
constitutionally
protected.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
there
is
but
for
purposes
of
the
statute
as
it
is
right
in
the
law
and
i
cited
in
my
brief,
it
is
not
applicable
in
this
case.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
it
is
statutory
privilege
as
it
is
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
we
do
have,
and
i
wish
to
emphasize
the
court
below
ignored
our
confidentiality
provision
in
this
law.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
the
answer
is
that
in
a
court
to
the
criminal
investigation
under
3371,
patient’s
identity
can
only
be
revealed
pursuant
to
court’s
orders
subpoena.
it
is
available
if,
and
i
give
the
example
in
my
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
would
question
whether
this
is
the
direct
enforcement
and
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
that
is
not
--
it
is
not
an
answer
to
your
question
truly
but
once
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
really
perhaps
do
not
know
what
is
the
answer
is
because
it
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
these
appellees
the
plaintiffs
here
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
oh,
well
that
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
an
affirmance
of
the
judgment
below
will
establish
a
constitutionally
protected
doctor-patient
privilege.
the
district
court
clearly
found
such
a
privilege
from
its
reading
of
the
abortion
in
roe
and
doe
cases.
i
believe
that
those
decisions
did
know
such
thing
that
it
was
a
misreading
of
those
decisions,
but
i
think
that
-
and
as
i
have
emphasized
-
that
it
would
be
improper
to
so
do,
there
are
valid
policy
reasons
not
to
and
i
do
not
think
that
had
been
at
all
answered
by
my
adversary.
this
court
also
has
declined
in
any
number
faith
just
as
last
term
to
extend
any
right
of
privacy,
such
as
or
i
would
say
going
back
one
last
term
but
in
the
planned
parenthood
of
missouri
v.
danforth,
even
in
abortion
context
reporting
abortions
with
names
and
dresses
would
not
violate
a
patient’s
privacy.
california
bankers
association
v.
shultz,
no
violation
of
right
of
privacy
in
reporting
bank
records.
perhaps
the
most
obvious
one
is
that
income
tax
reporting
is
well-known
and
many
people
some
expectation
of
privacy
in
that
area,
but
for
the
operation
of
income
tax
laws
and/or
i
submit
also
a
drug
control
program,
you
have
to
have
these
reports,
and
it
does
not
make
any
difference,
whether
the
statute
is
been
properly
administered.
if
we
had
never
computerized
one
prescription,
this
law
would
have
a
purpose,
computerization
is
not
necessary
to
the
operation
of
the
law.
computer
is
not
an
unconstitutional
machine,
there
is
a
specter
here.
now,
the
specter
in
this
case
is
whether,
is
the
fear
of
unauthorized
disclosure.
now,
the
appellees,
the
patients
here
were
totally
ignorant
of
this
law,
what
it
really
was.
they
have
thought
that
their
record
is
going
to
be
available
to
the
police,
to
the
army,
to
the
bar
association,
that
they
were
going
to
be
maintained
for
ever
and
ever,
and
that
is
simply
was
not
and
is
not
the
case.
and
a
fear
of
hypothetical
stigmatization
has
never
been
held
to
state
a
course
of
action.
only
this
past
term,
this
court
held
in
paul
v.
davis
that
even
if,
what
they
fear,
these
appellees
fear,
disclosure
of
their
drug
records
actually
had
occurred,
there
would
not
be
any
invasion
of
any
of
a
federally
protected
right.
indeed,
their
protection
comes
from
the
very
statute
they
are
attacking,
section
3371.
at
this
point
i
would
want
to
reserve
my
few
minutes
remaining
for
rebuttal
if
necessary.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well
i
would,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
i
think
i
did
reserve
a
couple
of
minutes
and
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
the
counsel
for
the
roe
appellees
stated
that
into
departmental
communication
it
allowed
under
the
statute.
that
is
basically
erroneous.
the
confidentiality
provision
in
this
law
once
again
ignored,
but
district
court
provides
that
patient
identity
is
only
available
to
the
department
of
health
to
investigate
as
people
who
are
responsible
for
the
enforcement
of
article
33
or
other
agencies
that
license
people
who
deal
in
these
controlled
substances.
but
the
example
given
by
the
attorney
for
the
patient
appellees
about
the
governor
getting
information
is
absolute
nonsense.
the
governor
would
be
violating
the
law
if
he
went
to
get
this
information,
and
i
think
i
can
fairly
state
that
under
this
law
the
commissioner
of
health
who
i
admitted
to
the
point
the
governor,
has
a
legal
duty
and
a
legal
right
to
sell
the
governor
--
this
again
happened
once
again
a
hypothetical
--
to
get
out
of
his
office,
and
of
course,
all
this
is
in
the
height
of
hypothesis.
now,
i
also
would
like
to
emphasize
that
the
confidentiality
provision
here
is
one
of
the
most
carefully
drawn
i
think
under
analysis,
and
when
you
speak
about
income
tax
record,
indeed
the
reason
you
speak,
you
find
leaks
perhaps
of
income
tax
record
is,
that
the
law
allows
those
records
that
he
provided
to
any
government
official.
this
is
not
the
case
in
the
operation
of
our
filing
triplicate
prescriptions.
there
is
also
this
factor
of
lack
of
results,
claim
of
one
or
two
in
20
months
of
operation.
in
point
of
fact
and
i
think
i
have
found
it
in
the
record.
in
point
of
fact
we
did
not
have
the
capability
of
printing
out
patient
names,
of
extracting
patient
names
from
the
computer
until
about
roughly
august,
1974
and
there
was
a
trial
in
december.
i
think
it
is
irrelevant
to
the
constitutionality
of
this
section
whether
we
have
got
one
report,
50
reports,
or
150
reports,
but
basically
you
had
a
system
in
its
infancy.
there
are
of
certain
priorities
in
the
department
of
health.
constitutionality
of
a
statute
on
its
face
-
and
that
is
what
we
are
involved
here
--
can
not
depend
on
the
efficiency
of
proper
operation
by
the
appellant.
indeed,
as
i
have
cited
in
my
reply
brief,
if
there
had
been
a
preliminary
injunction,
let
us
say,
for
example
grants
against
this
system
and
there
was
one
for
about
four
or
five
or
six
months,
you
would
have
no
results
to
discuss.
it
is
rather
obvious
that
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
depends
on
whether
it
is
reasonably
directed
to
accomplishing
its
purpose
the
discussion
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
would
submit
that
there
is
no
necessity.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
necessity
to
send
this
case
back.
it
has
been
mentioned
by
the
amici
curiae
brief,
because
it
is
rather
obvious
that
the
record
in
later
months
showed
we
were
getting
all
types
of
reports.
but
i
submit
that
that
is
a
totally
erroneous
test
of
constitutionality.
that
would
mean
that
in
california
if
they
got
proper
results
or
results
to
impress
district
court
judge
is
constitutional
in
california.
if
in
idaho
they
might
get
only
ten
because
small
(inaudible)
no
need.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
thank
you.
