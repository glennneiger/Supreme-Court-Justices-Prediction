justice
john
paul
stevens
whalen
against
roe
is
a
case
involving
the
constitutionality
of
the
new
york
law
requiring
that
prescriptions
for
certain
potentially
dangerous
drugs
be
prepared
and
triplicate
on
a
special
form
which
identifies
the
name
and
address
of
the
patient.
after
the
prescription
is
dispense,
one
copy
of
the
form
is
forwarded
to
the
state
department
of
health
where
the
information
on
the
form
is
recorded
in
a
computer
file.
the
computer
is
intended
to
detect
instances
of
potential
drug
abuse
by
identifying
cases
of
over
prescription.
procedures
were
adopted
to
ensure
the
security
of
the
prescription
records
and
other
than
the
in
the
course
of
a
drug
abuse
investigation
disclosure
of
patientâ€™s
identity
is
prohibited
by
law
and
made
a
crime.
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
a
group
of
patients
who
had
received
some
of
the
drugs
and
doctors
who
had
prescribed
them.
they
brought
this
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
which
held
that
the
prescription
reporting
system
needlessly
invaded
protected
zones
of
privacy
and
was
therefore
unconstitutional.
because
our
examination
of
the
state
system
convinces
us
that
new
york
has
not
exceeded
its
broad
power
to
control
the
distribution
of
potentially
dangerous
drugs
and
because
we
are
also
convinced
that
as
designed
and
administered,
the
system
avoids
an
invasion
of
any
constitutionally
protected
rights.
we
unanimously
reversed
the
district
court
and
hold
that
the
new
york
law
does
not
offend
the
constitution.
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
stewart,
while
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court,
have
each
filed
a
brief
concurring
opinion.
