unknown
speaker
does
new
york
have
any
legal
requirement
that
either
pharmacist
in
question
or
the
doctor
in
question,
keep
a
record
of
drugs
he
has
prescribed
and
that
that
record
be
available
for
inspection
on
the
premises?
unknown
speaker
did
your
opponents
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
requirement
that
that
record
be
open
for
inspection?
unknown
speaker
the
name
of
the
patient
would
be
disclosed
under
the
prior
law,
wouldn’t
it,
beyond
the
description
on
it?
unknown
speaker
upon
demand.
unknown
speaker
for
periodic
inspection.
unknown
speaker
but
it
wasn’t
automatically
filed
in
a
computer
anomaly?
unknown
speaker
but
that
in
fact
was
the
difference
between
the
old
law
and
the
present
law
being
attacked,
by
the
present
law
that
is
being
attacked.
unknown
speaker
does
new
york
have
a
statute
requiring
gunshot
wounds
to
be
recorded
by
a
physician?
unknown
speaker
passed
on
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york?
unknown
speaker
this
is
whole
point
in
the
case,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
think
the
other
side
agrees
with
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
greenwald
i
may
be
sure,
you
are
taking
a
position
that
if
you
did
not
have
the
names
and
addresses,
the
state
could
not
effectively
do
what
it
wants
to
do
under
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
it
is
to
reach
doctors
like
the
late
dr.
moore
whose
case
we
had
here
a
year
or
two
ago
who
gave
prescriptions
particularly
to
who
never
came
to
his
office,
he
just
gave
them
out
wholesaler.
unknown
speaker
would
the
statute
catch
that
kind
of
violation?
unknown
speaker
the
record
shows
you
did
not
need
it.
in
fact,
you
did
not
say?
unknown
speaker
and
of
course
patients
couldn’t
use
a
different
name
each
place.
unknown
speaker
specious!
did
you
mean
that
a
person
that
is
addicted
to
dope,
is
worried
about
law
violations.
you
should
know
about
everything
else,
do
you
know
about
that?
we
will
commit...
unknown
speaker
yeah
but
this
is
not
the
short
answer
to
the
broad
question
that
you
cannot
catch
them
all
but
you
are
going
to
try
to
catch
as
many
as
you
can.
unknown
speaker
right,
nobody
can
prescribe
that.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
it
this
way
without
getting
into
-
i
do
not
know
anything
about
drugs
and
medicine
and
i
presume
you
do
not
either,
but
--
unknown
speaker
new
york
has
not
prohibited
commerce
in
any
of
these
schedule
ii
drugs,
has
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
all
of
these
are
permissible
for
a
doctor
to
prescribe,
none
of
them
are
prohibited
such
as
heroin
would
be
and
is.
unknown
speaker
either
sleeping
pills
and
various
emotional
tranquilizes
and
so
on
and
that
sort
of
thing.
unknown
speaker
i
think
morphine
is
included.
unknown
speaker
as
a
title
ii
drug?
unknown
speaker
any
difference
suit
from
your
point
of
view
on
the
police
power
of
the
state
in
controlling
any
of
these
drugs?
unknown
speaker
you
make
it
clarity
of
it
in
your
substances
to
balance
the
argument,
the
purpose
of
my
question
was
to
understand
the
context
of
this
statutory
requirement.
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
contravene
as
such.
unknown
speaker
mr.
greenwald
one
more
question
to
know,
if
we
affirm
here,
do
you
feel
the
existing
reporting
requirements
as
to
venereal
disease,
infectious
disease,
gunshot
wounds
of
your
state
will
be
jeopardized?
unknown
speaker
does
new
york
law
prohibit
the
prescribing
of
a
more
than
30
day
supply
of
schedule
ii
drugs?
unknown
speaker
you
are
talking
about
the
forging
of
a
registered
doctor’s
name
or
the
forging
of
nonexistent
doctor.
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
doctor-patient
privilege
in
new
york?
unknown
speaker
but
is
that
a
statutory
privilege?
unknown
speaker
or
there
is
any
other
operative
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
may
the
doctor
be
called
to
prove
the
case
against
a
patient
which
involves
revealing
of
medical
information?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
how
about
the
answer
of
my
question?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
patient
is
invaded
for
drug
trafficking,
can
you
call
a
doctor
for
example
and
making
testify
against
him
as
he
has
relevant
evidence
from
his
records?
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
not
know
what
the
answer
is.
unknown
speaker
but
you
argue
that
if
you
lose
this
case
on
unconstitutional
grounds
there
will
be
a
constitutional
doctor-patient
privilege.
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
about
that.
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
matter
of
state
law,
state
evidence
law.
unknown
speaker
you
would
find
the
same
thought
with
reporting
of
gunshot
wounds.
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
reporting
of
contagious
and
venereal
disease.
unknown
speaker
it
invades
a
certain
amount
of
privacy,
does
not
it?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
any
more
significant
than
--
there
are
some
doctors
who
will
not
perform
abortions
since
that
is
a
personal
scruple
on
the
part
of
the
doctor.
unknown
speaker
did
you
say
in
the
colloquy
with
our
brother
rehnquist
that
you
would
or
would
not
concede
the
state
could
require
the
patient
to
gave
his
name
to
the
doctor?
unknown
speaker
--
who
is
getting
the
prescription?
unknown
speaker
to
the
doctor,
and
there
is
no
further
requirement
reported
to
the
state.
unknown
speaker
or
the
state
is
requiring
the
physician
to
keep
a
record
of
the
patient’s
name.
unknown
speaker
so,
that
if
sometimes
if
there
were
probable
cause
to
suspect
something,
you
could
subpoena
the
records.
unknown
speaker
you
would
not
see
anything
wrong
with
that?
unknown
speaker
what
about
showing
the
doctor
before
a
grand
jury?
unknown
speaker
and
ask
him,
tell
me
the
names
of
the
patients
to
whom
you
prescribe
title
ii
drugs
in
the
last
year?
unknown
speaker
but
you
need
know
probable
cause
to
call
him
before
the
grand
jury.
unknown
speaker
well,
supervising
--
you
can
claim
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
but
that
is
not
the
questions
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that
is
the
question
of
the
state
law
whether
he
can
claim
the
doctor-patient
privilege.
certainly,
there
is
no
federal
doctor
patient
privilege
that
one
can
claim
before
a
grand
jury.
unknown
speaker
so,
what
is
the
difference
between
calling
it
before
a
grand
jury
and
inspecting
his
records?
unknown
speaker
oh
then
you
are
saying
in
response
to
justice
white
that
he
be
called
before
a
grand
jury
but
if
he
is
asked
to
disclose
the
names
of
his
patients,
he
then
asserts
this
district
court
decision.
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
saying
that
is
just
like
any
witness
before
a
grand
jury,
you
would
not
be
saying
that
this
would
be
special
to
the
doctor.
unknown
speaker
if
the
normal
rule
would
apply,
whatever
it
is?
unknown
speaker
well,
can
new
york
may
witnesses
before
a
grand
jury
to
find
the
answer
of
question
on
the
grounds
of
some
fishing
expedition
or
are
they
limited
to
the
fifth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
have
you
rather
heard
of
a
state
that
allows
a
witness
to
--
unknown
speaker
we
do
not
need
a
warrant
--
examine
own
for
a
grand
jury,
all
you
need
is
a
subpoena.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
you
are
not
suggesting
that
if
you
win
this
case
then
there
will
an
established,
a
constitutional
privilege
which
would
permit
a
patient
to
object
to
his
doctor
testifying
against
him.
unknown
speaker
in
a
criminal
case.
unknown
speaker
but
the
rule
you
are
contending
for
you
do
not
suggest
would
determine
that
question.
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
contending
for
generalized
constitutional
right
of
privacy
which
in
court’s
opinion
in
katz
v.
united
state
said
that
did
not
exist.
unknown
speaker
ullman,
dismissed
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted,
didn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
dissenting
opinion,
i
think
it
was.
unknown
speaker
did
you
say
judge
friendly
i
did
not
observe
judge
friendly
is
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
but
not
in
this
present
case.
unknown
speaker
but
now
the
state
does
not
need
probable
cause
under
the
preexisting
system
to
go
and
inspect
the
doctor’s
records.
unknown
speaker
will
you
compel
that
be
a
part
of
the
system
when
you
are
born,
in
most
states,
because
of
the
birth
certificate
filed
and
forwarded
to
the
state
registrar
statistics.
unknown
speaker
exactly
we
would
say
to
the
court
there
should
be
limits
on
the
degree
to
which
a
state
can
then
start
cataloging
every
activity.
unknown
speaker
then
you
are
saying
that
in
every
one
of
these
cases
where
the
state
does
not
require
any
kind
of
data
the
state
have
to
show
a
compelling
interest
or
a
clear
need
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
jaffe,
let
me
just
ask
one
question
that
is
running
through
my
mind.
if
you
look
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
individual
whose
privacy
is
being
invaded
because
his
name
is
being
put
in
a
file
at
some
place.
does
it
matter
to
him
whether
somebody
wants
to
find
out
whether
he
is
taking
these
drugs
or
not?
whether
the
person
trying
to
find
out
goes
to
the
corner
pharmacist
and
says
they
have
any
information
about
this
man
or
if
he
goes
to
albany?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
presumably
he
would
patronize
the
local
drugstore
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
the
individuals
concern
only
right
is
when
he
is
under
investigation.
unknown
speaker
well,
couldn’t
the
governor
go
to
the
corner
pharmacy
and
that
a
look
and
he
will
find
the
drugs
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
is
just
investigating
one
person
by
your
hypothesis,
and
the
information
is
available
either
in
albany
or
in
the
local
pharmacy.
unknown
speaker
it
is
easier
to
go
to
albany
than
it
is
to
go
to
corner
drug
shop.
unknown
speaker
and
to
income
tax,
federal
income
tax
returns
are
supposed
to
be
of
the
utmost
secret
category
of
the
privacy
and
yet
we
know
it
is
a
practical
matter
that
they
are
leaked
especially
in
recent
years.
now,
would
you
regard
that
as
a
flow
in
it?
unknown
speaker
but
don’t
you
think
self-control
is
necessary?
