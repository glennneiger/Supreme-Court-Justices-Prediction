justice
thurgood
marshall
in
new
york
city
the
doctor
does
not
know
where
the
patient
lives.
in
new
york
city,
believed
or
not,
i
don’t
think
judicial
notice
is
not
a
rule
to
deal
with
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
wouldn’t
imagine
that
the
doctor
you
are
talking
about,
do
not
give
bills.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
schedule
ii
drugs
are,
as
i
understand
it,
are
various
drugs
that
have
a
preferably
good
medical
and
pharmaceutical
purpose
when
properly
used
and
prescribed
for
certain
given
elements,
physical
or
emotional
or
whatever,
but
whose
used
by
people
who
do
not
need
them
or
whose
overused
maybe
even
by
people
who
do
need
them,
is
an
abuse,
and
can
become,
can
lead
to
physical
or
psychological
dependence.
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
the
schedule
ii
drugs
are
not
hardcore
narcotics,
are
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
also
true
as
you
said
you
only
have
20
people
who
would
do
all
of
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah
i
am
forgetting
anything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
mr.
jaffe
your
point
i
understand
is
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
that
is
right.
i
understand
your
point
is
that
whatever
position
the
doctor
makes
a
judge
will
decide
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
whether
it
is
--
if
it
is
a
fishing
or
whatever
it
is,
it
will
be
judge
who
decide
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
greenwald,
if
we
could
find
a
way
to
send
this
case
back,
then
what
do
you
think
as
(inaudible)
new
york
is,
they
might
forget
about
it?
