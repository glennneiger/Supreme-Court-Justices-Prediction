mr.
michael
lesch
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
i
should
state
the
issue
in
this
case
as
i
understand
it.
the
judgments
of
the
court
below
enjoined
enforcement
and
declared
unconstitutional
this
statute
in
so
far
as
it
required
disclosure
to
the
state
of
new
york
of
the
identity
of
patients
receiving
schedule
ii
drugs.
now,
mr.
greenwald
just
referred
to
the
danforth
case
in
which
this
court
upheld
record
keeping
requirements,
but
yesterday
i
had
the
opportunity
to
look
in
the
library
of
the
supreme
court
and
to
look
at
the
forms
that
were
actually
required
by
the
state
of
missouri
in
the
danforth
case,
and
those
forms
specifically
said
that
they
did
not
want
the
patients’
name,
all
they
wanted
was
the
patients’
number.
so
that
if
the
state
of
missouri
was
interested
in
statistical
information
related
to
a
particular
patient
and
they
wanted
more
information
about
that
patient.
they
could
then
go
back
and
get
the
name,
but
there
was
nothing
on
file
in
the
state
of
missouri.
there
was
no
computer
printout
of
all
the
names
of
people
who
had
had
abortions.
mr.
michael
lesch
no,
your
honor,
we
are
not
challenging
that
here
today.
mr.
michael
lesch
no,
we
do
not
concede
it
either,
but
we
do
not
think
that
that
point
has
to
be
reached.
mr.
michael
lesch
there
is
the
constitutional
difference.
it
is
our
position,
when
the
state
of
new
york
obtains
125,000
prescriptions
per
month
through
a
massive
computerization
and
record
collection
system,
2.5
million
prescriptions
over
a
period
of
the
year
and
it
turns
out
that
they
have
two
suspects
in
that
system,
one
of
them
it
turns
out
is
exonerate
and
the
other
one
is
unresolved
at
the
time
of
trials,
the
whole
system
--
mr.
michael
lesch
if
the
system
--
well,
but
the
same
thing
happened
before
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history,
there
are
no
statistics
that
this
type
of
system
is
necessary,
triplicate
prescription
are
phantasm
or
specter
or
an
unsupported
theory
that
mr.
greenwald
and
the
department
of
health
have
found
in
this
case.
for
example,
mr.
greenwald
gave
a
lot
of
hypothetical
situations
to
the
whole
court
today,
none
of
them
are
supported
in
this
record.
they
had
mr.
cannizaro
(ph)
testified
who
was
the
head
of
their
system,
they
had
mr.
belize
(ph)
testified,
then
we
have
the
whole
legislative
history
as
part
of
the
record
before
this
court,
no
one
has
ever
suggested
that
the
so-called
doctor
to
doctor
problem
is
really
a
problem.
yeah,
that
was
on
that
basis
that
they
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
sent
the
case
back
to
trial.
the
principle
argument
that
they
made
was
that
there
was
a
doctor
to
doctor
problem
here
namely
that
patients
using
the
same
name
would
go
to
more
than
one
doctor
in
order
to
obtain
the
elicit
supplies
of
these
drugs.
but
that
problem
turned
out
to
be
nonexistent
and
it
is
against
that
fact
that
thousands
of
names
of
patients
are
being
put
on
a
computer
as
to
which
there
is
instant
access.
so,
anybody
who
is
authorized
and
the
statute
provides
for
interdepartmental
transfer
of
this
information
can
obtain
that
information.
moreover,
the
record
is
also
uncontradicted
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
the
security
system
for
this
program
is
entirely
inadequate.
there
was
one
witness
in
this
case,
a
man
by
the
name
of
wasserman
(ph).
he
was
an
expert
on
security,
he
pointed
out
defect
after
defect
after
defect
in
this
system,
by
the
way
the
--
mr.
michael
lesch
our
constitutional
argument
turns
on
the
basic
right
of
privacy
that
when
you
have
here,
first
of
all
a
relationship
that
has
been
historically
recognized,
for
example,
by
the
existence
of
the
physician-patient
privilege.
mr.
michael
lesch
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
--
mr.
michael
lesch
that
is
quite
right,
but
there
is
something
in
the
constitution
as
this
court
has
found
in
roe
v.
wade
and
doe
v.
bolton
that
there
are
certain
attributes
of
that
relationship
that
deserve
protection.
mr.
michael
lesch
no,
i
do
not
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
entirely
different
case.
mr.
michael
lesch
absolutely
not,
that
is
entirely
different
because
in
the
reporting
of
gunshot
wounds
or
in
the
reporting
of
contagious
diseases,
there
is
the
compelling
state
interest,
there
is
the
legitimate
interest
of
the
state.
if
somebody
shoots
somebody
else,
the
state
ought
to
take
actions
and
the
state
ought
to
find
out
about
a
gunshot
wound
as
quickly
as
it
can,
but
if
someone
is
--
mr.
michael
lesch
it
invades
a
certain
amount
of
privacy.
in
doe
v.
bolton
and
roe
v.
wade
this
court
did
not
hold
that
there
is
an
absolute
right
of
privacy.
it
only
referred
to
the
first
trimesters
the
right
to
make
the
abortion
decision.
we
are
not
saying
that
the
right
of
privacy
is
absolute
in
any
sense,
but
we
are
saying
that
the
court
looks
at
the
relationship,
looks
at
the
doctor’s
right
to
prescribe
and
there
is
testimony
in
this
case,
for
example,
by
a
psychiatrist,
that
he
would
not
prescribe
schedule
ii
drugs
to
patients
of
his
because
he
would
have
to
tell
them
about
the
filing
requirement.
mr.
michael
lesch
no,
it
is
more
than
that
i
believe
your
honor
because
in
roe
v.
wade
and
doe
v.
bolton,
this
court
talked
about
the
right
to
practice
medicine
unhindered
by
non-medical
considerations.
it
is
a
non-medical
consideration,
we
urge
as
to
what
the
effect
of
the
filing
requirement
will
be
on
the
future
help
of
the
patients.
that
should
not
be
what
goes
into
the
doctor’s
mind
when
he
decide,
is
this
drug
necessary
for
my
treatment
to
this
patient.
it
ought
to
be
simply
what
is
the
patient’s
medical
history
and
what
will
the
affect
of
this
drug
be
on
the
patient.
this
court
has
held
that
there
are
other
ways
to
monitor
doctors;
there
are
licensing
requirements.
the
state,
for
example,
can
on
the
prescriptions,
we
are
not
challenging
this,
the
state
can
require
the
doctors
to
file
all
of
their
prescriptions
with
the
doctor’s
name
on
it.
the
only
thing
that
we
object
to
and
that
is
why
i
restated
the
issue
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument
is
the
patient’s
name.
so,
in
the
case
that
you
mentioned
mr.
chief
justice
before,
the
moore
case,
if
a
physician
is
giving
is
out
a
large
number
of
prescriptions
of
schedule
ii
drugs,
the
department
of
health
can
go
to
that
physician
and
ask
him
to
see
the
patient
records
and
check
upon
the
bona
fides
of
every
one
of
those
of
things
but
what
we
were
doing
--
mr.
michael
lesch
the
patient
to
ho
give
--
mr.
michael
lesch
whether
the
state
could
require
the
patient
to
give
his
to
the
doctor.
mr.
michael
lesch
oh,
i
have
no
problem
with
the
state
giving
--
the
patient
giving
his
own
name
to
the
physician.
mr.
michael
lesch
i
have
no
problem
with
the
state
requiring
the
physician
to
keep
name.
mr.
michael
lesch
exactly.
mr.
michael
lesch
no,
i
would
not
because
there
you
have
--
mr.
michael
lesch
i
would
see
nothing
wrong
for
calling
a
doctor
before
grand
jury.
mr.
michael
lesch
yes,
and
there
is
the
basic
distinction
between
that
case
and
the
case
we
have,
and
that
is
that
that
case
provides
re-invocation
of
the
judicial
process
which
the
two
concurring
justices
in
the
--
mr.
michael
lesch
you
need
no
probable
cause
but
you
do
have
a
district
court
judge
supervising
the
conduct
of
the
grand
jury
proceeding.
mr.
michael
lesch
no,
if
he
claims
on
behalf
of
his
patient,
the
doctor-patient
privilege
--
and
it
is
determined
by
the
district
court
judge
that
the
question
that
are
being
asked
to
that
doctor
are
simply
a
fishing
expedition,
he
want
be
required
to
ask
that
--
mr.
michael
lesch
well,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
--
to
the
extent
that
we
are
talking
about
that,
and
i
would
obtain
in
the
state
court
proceedings.
mr.
michael
lesch
if
there
is
a
right
of
privacy
that
a
patient
and
a
physician
--
that
a
patient
has
and
that
a
physician
can
protect
then
a
court
can
supervise
the
exercise
of
that
right
of
privacy
during
grand
jury
testimony
or
during
demands
for...
mr.
michael
lesch
if
in
fact
he
has
reason
to
believe
that
this
is
a
fishing
expedition
or
there
is
no
basis
for
such
a
request,
he
can
do
so,
but
that
is
not
--
mr.
michael
lesch
i
am
not
saying
that.
yes
that
--
excuse
me,
your
honor
is
correct,
this
is
what
i
am
saying.
mr.
michael
lesch
the
normal
rule
would
apply,
but
you
would
have
the
opportunity
for
judicial
intervention,
and
that
is
what
we
do
not
have
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
lesch
your
honor
i
cannot
answer
that,
i
think
that
if
--
mr.
michael
lesch
if
a
warrant
is
insufficiently
specific,
if
a
request
for
information
is
overly
general
then
i
think
the
objection
to
the
request
for
information
can
be
made
that
it
is
a
fishing
expedition.
mr.
michael
lesch
your
honor
i
was
talking
about
a
request
for
information
to
a
physician
by
way
of
want
or
subpoena.
mr.
michael
lesch
i
am
mr.
lesch
your
honor.
mr.
michael
lesch
exactly,
exactly.
mr.
michael
lesch
that
is
the
only
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make
here.
whereas
here
we
have
the
collection
of
millions
of
prescriptions
without
any
opportunity
for
a
judge
to
decide
anything,
and
absolutely
no
need
shown
either
before
the
statute
was
enacted
or
since
it
has
been
enacted
that
these
had
any
effect
whatsoever.
we
have
31
persons
who
are
operating
this
system
and
have
access
to
the
information,
we
have
exactly
two
suspects
in
the
20-month
that
the
system
was
operated,
and
in
that
time
one
of
them
was
discharged
and
the
other
was
left
on
result.
mr.
michael
lesch
no,
constitutional
privilege,
what
i
am
saying
though
is
--
mr.
michael
lesch
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
as
far
as
i
am
concerned.
i
am
not
saying
that
it
is
impossible
that
this
court
will
some
day
decide
that
certain
aspects
of
the
physician-patient
relationship
are
privileged,
for
example
a
psycho
analyst
--
mr.
michael
lesch
absolutely
not,
it
certainly
would
not,
that
is
a
question
for
another
day.
as
the
question
is
relating
to
gunshot
wounds
which
is
the
much
simpler
case,
as
said
before
i
have
no
problem
with
that
or
the
reporting
of
venereal
diseases.
mr.
michael
lesch
well
following
the
katz
case,
this
case
decide
doe,
roe,
it
also
decided
the
case
of
buckley
v.
valeo.
in
all
of
those
cases
that
court
recognized
that
privacy
is
a
constitutionally
protected
right.
now,
i
am
not
saying
that
it
is
a
generalized
right
of
privacy.
what
i
am
referring
to
here
is
the
right
of
a
physician
to
practice
medicine
which
is
well
within
the
confines
of
this
court’s
prior
decision,
the
right
of
a
patient
to
receive
advice
untrammeled
by
non-medical
consideration
which
is
also
well
within
this
court’s
prior
decision.
i
am
not
saying
that
every
aspects
of
privacy
is
constitutionally
protected,
but
i
am
saying
when
you
have
the
peculiar
situation
of
first
of
all
the
physician-patient
relationship
and
secondly
you
have
the
effect
on
the
practice
of
medicine
by
the
physician
and
thirdly
you
have
the
total
lack
of
any
necessity
for
the
disclosure
of
millions
of
names
of
highly
personal
information
of
the
state,
but
under
these
circumstances
the
right
of
privacy
also
exists.
the
court
in
poe
v.
ullman
talked
about
the
right
of
privacy
being
a
rational
continual,
and
i
believe
that
this
case
is
a
rational
continuation.
mr.
michael
lesch
i
was
referring
to
the
concurring
opinion
in
that
case
which
was
quoted
by
judge
friendly
(ph)
in
the
court
below.
mr.
michael
lesch
i
think
it
was
at
that
time
but
that
was
also
before
doe
and
roe
your
honor.
mr.
michael
lesch
well,
there
was
a
--
judge
friendly
--
originally
this
case
was
dismissed.
mr.
michael
lesch
what
happened
in
this
case
was
originally
judge
carter
dismissed
the
case
for
one
of
the
substantial
federal
questions
and
then
went
opt
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
judge
friendly
instituted
a
temporary
restraining
order
or
continued
the
one
the
judge
carter
granted
in
effect
held
that
there
was
substantial
federal
question
and
quoted
the
poe
v.
ullman
case.
he
then
sent
it
back
down
for
arguments
on
the
preliminary
injunction
motion
and
it
was
only
after
we
have
established
in
the
record
in
this
case
all
of
the
facts
that
i
am
talking
about
now,
but
then
the
case
came
up
to
this
court
with
a
full
record
where
it
is
shown
that
there
is
no
need
for
this
system.
i
believe
we
have
also
shown
that
the
federal
drug
abuse
prevention
and
control
act
has
no
triplicate
prescription
provisions
uniform
controlled
substances
act
has
no
triplicate
prescription,
provision
39
says
that
the
union
has
no
such
provision.
this
court
has
often
held
that
where
so
many
other
states
have
no
triplicate
prescription
or
have
no
comparable
provision
in
their
statute
that
is
also
an
indication
that
those
provisions
are
unnecessary.
the
fact
is
in
this
case
that
there
has
not
been
a
scintilla
of
evidence
and
mr.
greenwald
for
the
state
has
not
pointed
too
a
scintilla
of
evidence
that
there
was
any
need
whatsoever
for
the
patients’
names.
if
there
were
some
showing
of
need
as
there
is
not
in
this
at
that
point
the
state
may
well
condition
use
of
a
more
effective
mean
which
involves
the
danger
to
constitutionally
protected
privacy
on
the
taking
of
all
reasonable
precautions
which
limit
the
risk.
so
that
is
the
point
where
the
adequacy
of
the
state
security
system
comes
into
place
justice
rehnquist
in
response
to
your
prior
question,
but
we
do
not
reach
to
that
point
in
this
case
and
the
three-judge
court
did
not
reach
it
in
this
case
because
there
was
absolutely
no
showing.
mr.
michael
lesch
in
that
case
i
would
withdraw.
thank
you
very
much.
