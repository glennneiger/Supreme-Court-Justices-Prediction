mr.
farr,
before
you
commence,
will
you
help
me
understand
the
fact
of
the
situation.
the
main
issue
that
i
understand
it
is
the
boundary
of
the
reservation,
the
location
of
the
boundary.
who
occupies
the
land
within
the
disputed
area?
do
indians
still
occupy
those?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
the
principal
interests
of
the
indian
tribe
as
i
understand
it
is
whether
the
tribes
or
the
state
exercises
jurisdiction
within
the
disputed
area.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
well,
who
in
fact
has
exercised
jurisdiction
legally?
what
laws
have
prevailed
within
the
disputed
area
in
recent
years,
how
far
back?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
state
criminal
law
has
been
imposed
or
enforced
within
the
disputed
area.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
just
one
other
question,
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
individual
title
to
any
particular
portion
of
land.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
just
the
boundary
of
the
reservation.
