mr.
william
j.
janklow
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
can,
for
beginning
here,
start
out
and
refer
again
to
the
map
that
frankly
is
in
the
brief
of
the
tribe,
for
the
appellant
in
this
case,
because
there
were
several
questions
by
members
of
the
court
concerning
the
areas.
this
particular
area
where
my
left
hand
is
over
is
gregory
county,
which
is
affected
by
the
1904
act.
this
particular
area
where
my
hand
is
now
over
is
tripp
county,
south
dakota,
which
is
affected
by
the
1907
act,
and
where
you
see
these
two
counties
stacked
on
top
of
each
other,
or
i
should
say
one
on
the
other,
the
top
county
is
mellette
county,
which
is
affected
by
the
1910
act.
there
is
absolutely
no
dispute
in
this
case
with
respect
to
todd
county.
while
the
state
of
south
dakota,
the
tribe,
the
federal
government,
i
think
it
is
the
only
time
we
have
ever
all
agreed;
we
clearly
agree
that
that
is
an
indian
reservation.
even
though
there
are
fee
patented
lands
on
it,
we
feel
that
that
is
the
type
of
situation
that
the
court
was
addressing
in
moe,
when
it
construed
the
subsection
6
of
the
general
allotment
act,
and
not
subsection
5
of
the
general
allotment
act,
or
subsection
12
of
act
of
1889.
so
when
the
government
a
moment
ago
was
responding
that
this
is
the
situation
in
moe,
the
court
construed
subsection
6,
and
it
is
this
type
of
reservation
in
the
todd
county
area,
which
is
implored
as
the
checker
board
kind
of
problem
that
the
court
has
addressed
itself
too
before.
but
that
is
not
the
situation
with
respect
to
mellette,
tripp,
and
gregory.
there
has
been
some
questions
by
members
of…
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
am
sorry,
lyman
county
is
this
small
little
area.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
that
is
correct.
that
is
lyman
county,
i
am
sorry
i
missed
it,
it
is
just
a
small
little
corner
up
there.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
fee
owned
lands
in
todd
county
are
subject
to
county
taxation.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
well,
the
rosebud
sioux
tribe,
that
is
something
that
was
frankly
ploshed
over
by
the
government.
the
rosebud
sioux
tribe
has
passed
an
ordinance
which
provides
that
they
have
jurisdiction,
civil
and
criminal
over
everybody
within
all
four
county
areas,
it
is
a
recent
vintage
this
particular
one
is.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
about
time
this
lawsuit
started,
but
their
law
and
order
code
now
provides
that
they
have
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
over
everybody
within,
we
call
it
the
four
county
area,
even
though
lyman
county
would
make
it
a
fifth
county.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
they
do
not
say
that.
their
law
and
order
code
provides
that
they
have
jurisdiction
over
everyone
within
the
act
of
1889,
which
is
this
area.
it
has
been
approved
by
the
united
states
department
of
interior
as
a
valid
tribal
ordinance
of
recent
vintage
also.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
absolutely
not
with
respect
to
non-indians,
but
that
is
clearly
not
the
issue
in
this
case,
but
we
do
not
conceive
that
at
all,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
no
sir.
now,
the
question
was
also
asked
in
the
disputed
area,
and
we
will
call
that
the
--
it
is
three,
and
if
i
say
three,
i
really
mean
three
in
a
part
of
fourth
or
four,
but
in
the
disputed
area,
the
question
was
asked
whether
or
not
the
tribe
has
exercised
jurisdiction.
the
government
responded.
they
believe
everybody
has
been
exercising
jurisdiction.
i
defy
anybody,
anytime
since
1904
to
show
any
case
that
the
federal
government
has
ever
handled
in
the
federal
courts,
with
respect
to
non-indian
land
in
gregory
county.
since
the
act
passed
in
1907
with
respect
to
tripp
county
and
with
respect
to
1910,
with
respect
to
mellette
county.
there
is
litigation
with
respect
to
the
indian
lands
because
what
we
have
in
the
old
reservation,
there
were
indian
allotments
that
were
taken,
and
under
1151,
subsection
c,
title
18
of
the
united
states
code,
there
is
no
argument
by
the
state
of
south
dakota
that
that
is
clearly
federal
jurisdiction,
and
for
all
we
care,
that
is
also
the
rosebud
sioux
tribe’s
jurisdiction.
every
place
there
is
an
indian
allotment
in
these
three
counties,
and
this
is
what
you
call
the
checker
board.
it
is
what
you
have
in
sioux
and
what
you
have
in
some
other
places.
but
the
important
thing,
although
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
it
abhors
checker
board
jurisdiction,
we
have
lived
with
it
and
we
have
lived
with
it
comfortably
in
the
state
of
south
dakota,
with
respect
to
these
three
counties
since
the
turn
of
the
century,
and
we
have
not
had
a
problem.
it
has
never
been
up
here
before
this
court
before.
there
has
not
been
a
prolific
amount
of
litigation
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
even
in
the
federal
district
court.
i
think
all
the
cases
that
have
ever
been
involved
in
a
jurisdiction
fight
are
cited
in
either
the
government’s
brief,
the
tribe’s
brief,
or
our
brief,
and
there
is
very
few
of
them;
probably
eight
or
nine
in
number,
and
there
has
never
been
a
dispute,
and
we
work
comfortably
with
jurisdiction,
very
little…
mr.
william
j.
janklow
in
terms
of
the
three
counties,
because
i
do
not
have
figures
for
todd…
mr.
william
j.
janklow
in
terms
of
a
perspective,
todd
county
is
a
little
better
than
25
miles
wide
and
50
miles
long.
this
will
be
a
close
facsimile
of
what
the
size
is,
but
it
is
approximately
10%
of
the
land
area,
and
mellette,
tripp,
and
gregory
counties
are
indian
trust
lands,
and
that
is
all.
approximately
10%
of
the
population
in
mellette,
tripp,
and
gregory
counties
are
indian
people.
it
is
split
as
to
where
they
live.
some
of
them
live
on
trust
lands
and
some
of
them
live
on
deeded
lands.
the
tribe
has
never,
until
1972,
even
attempted
to
exercise
jurisdiction.
if
for
no
other
reason,
i
can
tell
you
i
lived
on
that
reservation
for
six
years
as
director
of
the
oeo
legal
services.
i
was
the
chief
of
the
legal
services
on
the
oeo
program
down
there.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
deeded
land
in
those
three
counties,
the
tribe
has
never
exercised
jurisdiction
until…
mr.
william
j.
janklow
even
though
occupied
an
indian,
there
has
never
been
anything
in
the
tribal
court.
there
are
thousands
of
divorce
cases
that
had
been
handled,
adoptions,
guardianships,
and
probates.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
it
is
allotted
or
indian
--
i
call
it
indian
trust,
which
would
not
only
include
allotments
but
also
land
that
is
not
allotted,
that
is
in
an
indian’s
name,
i
would
include
that
in
the
total.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
the
original
agency
was
rosebud
agency.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
the
eastern
end
of
the
rosebud
reservation
consisted
of
brule
sioux,
which
was
added
to
the
rosebud’s
reservation
with
their
consent.
i
do
not
know
all
that
history,
but
i
do
know
that
they
are
not
all
rosebuders,
although
there
are
all
rosebuders
now.
but
the
tribe
has
never
exercised
jurisdiction
and
the
federal
government
never
has
either
in
those
areas.
so
what
we
have
in
terms
of,
if
you
want
to
just
talk
in
jurisdiction,
1151
takes
care
of
it.
its
subsection
c,
with
respect
to
those
individual
pieces
of
indian
land
and
the
three
county
areas,
and
its
subsection
a,
i
believe,
which
is
any
land
within
the
area
of
todd
county,
whether
it
be
deeded
or
non-deeded
land.
so
the
tribes
filed
a
lawsuit,
and
we
are
now
here.
a
couple
of
important
characteristics
of
how
we
construe
these
things.
there
are
three
basic
cases
that
i
think
everybody
conceives
lead
the
way.
the
first
one
is
the
decision
in
seymour,
the
second
one
is
the
decision
in
mattz,
and
the
third
one
is
the
decision
last
year
involving
our
state
of
south
dakota.
in
mattz
and
seymour,
both
of
them,
this
court
handed
down
a
rule
of
construction
of
these
indian
treaties
and
these
indian
statutes
that
are
past.
it
said,
you
look
on
the
face
of
the
act,
and
if
it
is
not
absolutely
clear,
if
it
is
not
explicitly
clear
from
the
face
of
the
act,
you
go
to
the
legislative
history
and
surrounding
circumstances,
and
this
court
did
that
in
mattz
when
it
wrote
the
mattz
decision.
it
found
that
the
act,
there
was
some
question
about
it,
went
behind
the
face
of
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
found
there
was
no
question
about
it,
but
still
went
behind
the
face
of
it,
and
used
legislative
history
and
surrounding
circumstances
to
support
the
decision.
they
did
exactly
the
same
thing
in
dakota;
in
the
dakota
decision,
they
also
cited
seymour
and
mattz
again
with
approval.
what
we
have
with
respect
to
the
rosebud
sioux
tribe
case
is
not
unlike
the
case
that
was
up
here
last
year
before
you,
and
that
is
the
dakota
case.
the
language
is
the
same
in
the
act,
cede,
sell,
convey.
that
is
exactly
what
the
other
one
hand.
there
is
only
one
difference
between
decoteau
and
this
case.
even
the
school
lands
are
there.
the
only
difference
is
that
this
is
un
sum
certain
and
there
is
a
great
distinction
being
made
about
that.
in
the
dakota
case,
the
tribe
was
told
and
knew
exactly
what
they
would
be
paid
for
their
land.
in
this
particular
case,
the
tribe
was
told
that
they
would
be
paid
so
much
for
the
entry
on
the
first
so
many
days.
in
other
words,
the
best
land
would
go
first.
so
it
would
be
like
$4.00,
then
$3.00
for
everybody
who
came
after
that,
and
$2.00
for
everybody
who
came
after
that.
then
no
guarantee
as
to
all
of
it
being
sold,
that
is
this
last
paragraph.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
think
the
figure
was,
it
was
asked
to
mr.
sonosky,
it
is
approximately
4,000
acres
of
this
total
huge
mass,
was
returned
in
around
1934,
in
the
30s.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
think
it
is
approximately
that.
now,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
do
not
follow
your
question,
i
am
sorry
justice
rehnquist?
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
did
not
read
anything.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
oh,
cede,
grant
and
sell,
is
that
what
you
mean?
mr.
william
j.
janklow
okay,
that
is
first
act,
the
1901
act.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
that
referred
to
gregory
county.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
to
my
knowledge,
no
land
was
returned
in
gregory
county.
now,
the
one
thing
that
you
have
to
remember
is…
mr.
william
j.
janklow
no,
not
sold
to
the
united
states.
we
are
not
alleging
that
it
was
sold
per
se
to
the
united
states.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
under
the
agreement
that
was
signed?
as
of
the
time
the
congress
passed
the
act.
what
we
have
in
the
act,
and
it
is
really
confusing
because
they
went
out
and
they
entered
into
an
agreement
with
the
indian
people
in
1901,
and
that
was
the
first
part,
that
is
the
part
that
talks
about
cede,
grant,
and
sell.
the
indian
people
agreed
and
signed
it
by
a
three-fourths
majority.
they
came
back
and
congress
did
not
buy
it.
but
the
best
thing
i
can
do
is
draw
your
attention,
there
are
three
volumes
of
appendices,
join
appendices
filed,
plus
we
have
our
own
that
is
filed
with
the
court,
and
it
goes
all
through
this
exhaustively,
there
is
an
incredible
amount
of
legislative
history
that
has
been
able
to
be
dug
up.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
the
gregory
country
area,
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
at
that
particular
time,
but
they
kept
it…
mr.
william
j.
janklow
no,
in
gregory
county,
and
not
the
entire
area,
sir,
no
sir,
all
the
surplus
and
unallotted
lands
are
what
they
gave
up.
but
also
replete
in
there
is
there
was
a
restoration
to
the
demand.
as
a
result,
the
only
thing
that
the
indian
people
kept
were
a
lingering
beneficial
interest,
and
that
is
what
is
discussed
--
the
government
has
discussed
that,
on
what
took
place
in
1934,
and
this
court
has
also
addressed
itself
to
that
in
the
ash
sheep
case
which
this
court
has
previously
handed
down.
in
the
ash
sheep
case,
they
said
that
these
kinds
of
things
kept
a
lingering
beneficial
interest.
the
one
thing
that
is
not
yet
been
previously
told
to
this
court,
in
1938
the
solicitor
has
handed
out
an
opinion
which
is
set
forth
as
document
#59
in
the
appendices.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
do
not
want
to
back
myself
into
a
cession
corner,
because
that
is
not
the
key
question.
mr.
justice
white,
the
key
question
is
whether
or
not
the
reservation
was
disestablished,
and
that
is
always
what
this
court
goes
to.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
well,
only
because
this
court
said
that
language
is
precisely
suited
for
cession
in
decoteau.
i
am
taking
that
exactly
from
what
this
court
said
a
year
ago
in
decoteau.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
it
is
not
in
the
1907
and
1910
act,
it
is
only
in
the
1904
act.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
right.
two
things
i
would
like
to
say
to
that
sir…
mr.
william
j.
janklow
there
are
two
things
i
would
like
to
draw
to
your
attention
to,
sir.
the
first
thing
is,
on
pages
41
of
petitioner’s
brief,
and
we
agree,
the
1904,
1907,
and
the
1910
acts
may
use
different
words,
but
the
congress
was
intended
to
do
the
same
thing.
they
have
the
same
force
in
effect.
we
do
not
argue
that
gregory,
tripp,
and
mellette,
or
the
1904,
the
1907,
and
the
1910
have
the
same
affect.
the
words
i
believe
used
by
petitioner
say
they
conceive
the
format
is
different,
but
not
the
substance.
the
1904,
in
legal
effect
the
language
is
the
same
as
the
1907
and
1910.
we
agree
with
that.
alright,
now,
specifically
to
get
on
to
the
1904
act,
i
think
it
is
really
important
that
we
understand
what
happened.
in
1901,
a
commissioner
was
sent
out
there.
he
made
an
agreement
with
the
indian
people
for
gregory
county.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
that
was
inspector
mclaughlin,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
he
came
back.
when
the
bill
was
submitted
to
congress
for
approval,
what
happened
was
there
was
a
huge
fight
that
erupted,
not
a
huge
fight,
but
there
was
a
disagreement
in
the
congress.
the
key
thing
was
several
of
the
eastern
congressmen
were
tired
of
giving
free
land
to
the
homesteaders.
they
wanted
them
to
pay
for
it,
and
they
were
tired
of
the
government
paying
the
indians
for
the
land
and
then
turning
around
and
giving
free
homestead.
so
they
got
into
this
issue,
and
this
is
where
it
all
came
to
a
head
in
america’s
history;
a
free
homestead
versus
pay
homestead
was
over
unfortunately
the
rosebud
reservation.
so
the
bill
did
not
pass.
then
a
bill
passed
which
provided,
and
i
believe
it
was
the
next
year
or
the
year
after
--
no,
they
got
into
the
discussion
on
the
homesteads,
and
they
sent
inspector
mclaughlin
back
out
to
the
rosebud
again.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
he
did
not
get
three
quarters,
but
he
got
a
majority
at
this
particular
time.
three
quarters
was
not
required
by
section
5
of
the
general
allotment
act.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
that
is
correct.
but
it
was
decided,
it
was
required
under
the
act
of
1889.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
then
lone
wolf
came
down.
the
lone
wolf
decision
came
down
in
1902,
which
came
in
right
in
between
the
time
the
indian
people
first
signed
the
act
and
had
the
three-fourths
signatures,
and
the
next
time
around
when
they
signed
it
in
1903
or
1904.
in
the
lone
wolf
decision,
this
court
very
clearly
took
care
of
the
problem
of
signatures
being
required
for
disestablishment
of
reservations
or
anything
else,
because
what
you
had
in
the
lone
wolf
case
was
a
place
where
they
required
three-fourths
also
by
previous
agreement,
and
the
government
did
not
get
it,
they
only
got
the
majority.
congress
passed
an
act.
they
went
to
the
supreme
court
and
this
court
held
that
congress
had
that
plenary
power,
and
that
they
did
not
have
to
stick
to
three-fourths,
but
they
could
use
a
majority.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
at
the
time
that,
that
happened
in
the
lone
wolf
decision,
they
say
that
what
you
are
dealing
with
is
the
plenary
power
of
congress.
so
as
a
result,
these
people
turned
around
--
lone
wolf
said
that
congress
would
not
exercise
this
power
that
it
had
without
using
it
in
a
wise
way
or
a
judicious
way.
they
sent
mclaughlin
back
out
there
when
they
never
had
to.
he
then
obtained
the
majority
of
the
signatures,
fully
explained
in
the
indian
people
and
again,
it
is
all
in
the
appendices,
the
transcripts
of
just
what
lone
wolf
meant
and
the
power
of
it,
and
the
congressional
records
and
the
house
reports
and
everything
are
replete
with
discussions
of
what
lone
wolf
meant.
so
everybody
knew
what
lone
wolf
meant.
he
came
back
and
then
they
passed
it
based
on
the
majority
thing.
now,
with
respect
to
1907
and
1910,
there
was
no
agreement
in
1910,
but
there
were
meetings
with
the
tribal
council,
but
at
that
point
in
time
nobody
was
ever
again
signing
agreement
because
of
the
lone
wolf
decision.
the
lone
wolf
did
away
with
that
particular
necessity.
you
can
go
through
the
legislative
history,
and
if
you
examine
the
government’s
brief
and
you
examine
the
tribe’s
brief,
you
find
criticisms
of
what
went
on
in
the
congress,
but
you
cannot
find
any
substantive
legislative
history.
there
are
hundreds
of
documents
that
pertain
to
it,
that
are
both
in
the
joint
appendix
as
well
as
the
individual
appendix.
i
draw
your
attention
to
the
document
at
629,
i
believe
it
is,
page
629
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
is
a
house
report,
which
just
lays
the
whole
thing
out.
there
are
about
six
pages
there
which
just
lays
out
in
detail
exactly
what
it
was
that
was
happening.
it
lays
out
that
these
reservations
were
being
disestablished.
although
i
was
asked
the
question
before,
the
cession
is
not
the
key
aspect,
whether
or
not
there
was
a
cession
frankly
is
not
even
relevant.
the
question
is
what
was
congress’
intent?
did
they
intent
to
disestablish
the
reservation?
because
if
the
answer
is
no,
we
got
three
new
counties
in
south
dakota
that
belong
to
the
state.
the
rosebud
reservation
has
been
quadrupled
in
size.
if
the
answer
is
yes,
the
congress
intended
to
disestablish
the
reservation,
then
the
answer
is
no.
we
live
with
what
we
have
lived
with
for
the
last
60
years.
so
that
is
the
key
issue.
that
is
the
crux
of
it.
that
is
what
mattz
has
taught
us,
and
frankly,
that
is
what
decoteau
has
taught
us.
they
have
laid
down
that
particular
criteria.
the
uncertain
sum
in
some
arguments
that
has
been
raised,
there
is
a
lot
of
issue
that
because
the
indians
did
not
know
ultimately
what
they
would
get
that
somehow
this
uncertain
sum
created
--
completely,
substantively
changed
these
types
of
arrangements.
it
is
not
clear.
all
the
congress
was
doing
was
changing
the
method
in
how
people
were
going
to
be
paid.
that
is
the
only
thing
that
congress
was
doing,
and
they
say
that
over
and
over
and
over
again
in
these
reports.
they
were
tired
of
using
taxpayer’s
money.
they
wanted
the
settlers
to
use
their
own
money.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
cannot
tell
you
that
there
is
any
magical
point
in
time.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
under
the
contract
in
1901?
mr.
william
j.
janklow
it
is
not
unclear
that
at
this
point
the
federal
government
did.
i
cannot
answer
that
because
the
government
obviously
had
a
title
to
give
away
the
settlers.
they
did
not
get
the
title
from
an
indian.
they
did
get
it
from
the
federal
government.
that
is
the
ones
who
gave
them,
and
there
are
lot…
mr.
william
j.
janklow
that
is
the
ones
that
was
handing
them
out.
they
were
signed
by
the
president
and
there
were
issues
they
set
pursuant
to
the
general
homestead
act.
it
is
what
every
patent
out
there
says.
so
i
cannot
say
whether
or
not,
but
that
is
--
if
you
are
familiar
with
the
1938,
i
cannot
describe
you
any
better
than
that
1938
solicitor’s
opinion,
which
does
discuss
this
out
of
the
ash
sheep
case,
where
it
talks
about
whether
or
not
this
lingering
beneficial
interest,
because
he
did
not
know
if
anybody
was
ever
going
to
move
on
it
and
buy
it,
whether
or
not
that
is
a
crucial
and
an
important
aspect.
what
they
held
is
that,
that
was
not
the
determining
factor.
whether
or
not
there
was
a
cession
was
not
important,
and
whether
or
not
the
reservation
was
disestablished
or
not,
was
not
important.
that
if
there
was
a
lingering
beneficial
interest
that
was
not
inconsistent
with
allowing
the
tribe
to
restore
that
to
the
areas,
what
would
be
outside
of
a
diminished
or
reduced
indian
reservation,
restoring
those
lands
out
in
an
area
like
that,
and
still
going
on
with
their
business,
like
we
had
in
the
rosebud
case.
that
1938
solicitor’s
opinion
just
lays
that
particular
aspect
out.
with
respect
to
the
ash
sheep
case,
the
same
thing
is
true,
and
i
draw
your
attention
to
one
thing
in
the
ash
sheep
case
that
involved
a
reservation,
which
although
it
had
a
lingering
beneficial
interest,
also
disestablished
part
of
that
reservation
and
created
a
new
boundary,
right
on
the
face
of
the
act.
so
there
is
an
example
of
a
place
where
we
do
have
a
situation
where
new
boundaries
were
created
on
the
face
of
the
act,
and
the
indians
still
kept
a
lingering
beneficial
interest
in
those
lands,
like
we
had
in
mellette,
tripp,
and
gregory
counties.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
do
not
know
that
there
is
--
it
could
be
one
of
two
times.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
think
it
is
at
the
time
that
the
act
of
congress
passed,
and
that
is
what
--
the
way
it
was
explained
to
the
indian
people,
and
it
was
also
explained
in
congress,
but
that
the
indian
people
were
allowed
to
continue
to
occupy
it.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
that
was
the
other
thing,
it
very
well
could
be.
i
honestly
cannot
say
because…
mr.
william
j.
janklow
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
all
happened
at
one
time.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
right,
but
as
to
each
half,
it
was
instantaneous.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
but
i
do
not
want
to
put
forward
that
position
because
you
cannot
tell
whether
it
was
then
or
when
the
settler
took
it.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
that
is
just
exactly
what
congress
said
over
and
over
and
over
in
its
congressional
record.
over
and
over
and
over
in
the
debates,
over
and
over
and
over
in
the
house
reports,
there
is
just
the
voluminous
stuff
and
it
is
replete
with
just
exactly
that.
that
the
only
change
--
that
they
were
not
even
thinking
about
whether
or
not…
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
think
it
is
page
629
of…
mr.
william
j.
janklow
it
is
a
house
report
that
was
sent
over
to
the
senate,
explaining
what
it
was
in
the
1904
bill,
629.
we
think
it
is
that
and
the
1938
solicitor’s
opinion,
which
is
found
as
docket
number
59
in
our
blue
state’s
appendices,
which
is
on
page
114.
those
are
the
two
ones
that
i
think
explain
that
whole
area
that
we
have
been
talking
about
for
the
last
several
minutes.
as
far
as
what
words
are
used
for
disestablishment,
if
you
look
at
the
cases,
you
see
that
we
have
everything
from
the
words,
cede,
sell,
convey,
disestablish,
restore
to
the
public
domain,
dispose,
diminish,
unfortunately
congress
never
used
any
one
set
of
magical
words.
that
is
why
every
time
that
this
court
has
been
faced
with
this
particular
kind
of
question,
whether
it
was
seymour,
whether
it
was
mattz,
whether
it
was
decoteau,
or
now,
that
you
have
to
go
back
and
you
have
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
and
the
surrounding
circumstances,
as
well
as
the
act
to
figure
it
out.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
page
629
in
the
brown
appendix.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
that
is
a
house
report.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
yes,
sir,
i
just
remember
reading
house
report,
i
do
not
know
if
it
is
a
committee
or
not,
it
is
just
house
report.
the
other
one
is
document
number
59
on
page
114
of
the
blue
appendix.
to
also
draw
the
court’s
attention
to
pages
99
through
about
105
in
the
brief,
if
you
look
at
what
is
known
as
the
todd
county
documents,
it
really
lays
out
what
exactly
all
the
understanding
of
the
parties
were.
because
what
happened
was,
under
congress’
power
to
disestablish
these
reservations,
they
could
have
always
gone
forward
and
disestablished
the
reservation.
they
went
back
for
1907.
they
went
back
for
1910.
the
records
are
replete
with
the
indian
people
saying
look,
you
came
once,
we
gave
you
gregory
county,
now
you
are
back
here
for
more
land.
this
is
in
the
meetings
with
the
council,
and
there
are
transcripts
on
these
that
are
all
through
the
records
that
are
before
you.
then
he
comes
back
in
1910
and
they
say
look,
we
gave
you
gregory
county
and
tripp
county,
now
our
reservation
is
half
the
size
it
used
to
be.
he
is
telling
them
look,
when
the
government
wants
it,
they
are
going
to
get
it,
let
us
talk
about.
so
they
again
agree,
and
the
way
it
goes.
then
in
1910,
he
goes
back
and
he
tries
to
take
tripp
county.
he
tries
to
open
tripp
county,
and
this
is
again
the
famous
inspector
mclaughlin,
the
great
land
grabber,
because
he
is
all
over
western
united
states
taking
land
from
everybody,
especially
if
they
are
indian.
he
is
back
there
again
negotiating,
and
he
happened
to
speak
sioux.
at
this
time
the
tribe
put
its
foot
down
and
they
said,
no
more,
we
gave
you
almost
all
of
our
reservation,
we
gave
you
three-fourths
of
it,
we
only
have
this
small
corner
left.
all
this
is
in
the
record.
that
is
all
we
have
left
of
our
reservation,
please
do
not
take
that
from
us.
he
went
back
although
he
had
been
sent
out
to
negotiate
another
agreement,
he
went
back
to
washington
and
told
that
to
the
congress,
told
that
to
the
interior
department,
and
the
interior
department
finally
suggested
to
congress
they
not
open
up
and
affect
todd
county
in
any
way.
so
there
was
no
change.
but
as
far
as
what
the
understanding
of
the
parties
were,
there
has
never
been
a
misunderstanding
of
the
parties;
be
it
the
federal
government,
the
tribe,
or
the
state
of
south
dakota,
until
1972.
after
the
decision,
frankly,
the
new
town
decision,
which
was
an
eight
circuit
decision
up
in
north
dakota,
everything
really
changed
in
the
jurisdiction
in
south
dakota.
we
have
had
litigation
after
litigation,
with
respect
to
every
one
of
our
reservations.
decoteau
was
first,
these
ones
here,
the
court
has
not
decided
whether
or
not
it
is
going
to
take
certiorari
on
“which
is
the
next
reservation
over.”
courts
in
counties
working
its
way
up
through
the
courts.
all
of
them
based
upon
the
fact
that
what
went
on
with
respect
to
the
new
town
decision
in
the
eight
circuit.
that
is
what
started
it
all.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
which
one?
mr.
william
j.
janklow
new
town
did
not
come
here.
there
had
been
other
substantive
decisions
that
have.
this
one
has,
and
the
other
one,
(inaudible)
has,
and
cook
has
been
decided
by
the
eight
circuit,
and
a
petition
for
cert
has
been
requested
and
i
think
it
is
nothing,
no
action
has
ever
been
taken
on
it.
todd
counties
had
other
action
taken
as
justice
knows,
we
had
the
beardslee
(ph)
decision,
where
it
talked
about
disestablishment
in
that
particular
case,
where
i
believe,
the
exact
language
is,
where
it
discusses
the
areas
other
than
todd
county
and
the
rosebud
and
said
a
disestablished
portion
of
the
reservation,
however,
that
disestablishment
may
have
been
affected.
this
is
the
decision
that
goes
way
back
into
the
60s,
into
the
middle
60s.
there
has
never
been
any
argument,
disagreement,
or
misunderstanding
by
anybody
until
the
policy
changes.
interestingly
enough,
we
are
here
today
against
the
united
states
of
america.
in
1973,
with
a
reservation
that
has
got
exactly
the
same
language
as
one
of
these
acts,
exactly
the
same
language.
united
states
ex
rel.
condon
v.
erickson,
which
is
another
eight
circuit
decision,
they
are
in
there
amicus
at
on
our
side,
on
the
state
of
south
dakota’s
side.
on
the
basis
of
the
new
town
decision,
the
eight
circuit
turns
around
and
says
that
the
government’s
position
was
wrong.
now
they
are
in
here
sounding
like
--
since
time
in
memorial,
they
have
taken
the
position
that
--
in
opposition
to
the
state
of
south
dakota.
in
the
la
plant
case
that
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
decided
many,
many
years
ago,
20
or
30
years
ago,
i
cannot
remember
the
date,
again,
the
federal
government
came
in
and
took
the
position
that
those
reservations
have
been
disestablished.
but
they
are
coming
and
arguing
now
in
1975
that
this
has
always
been
the
consistent
policy
of
the
federal
government’s
since
then.
unfortunately,
we
have
to
look
back
and
see
what
happened
at
the
turn
of
the
century
because
that
is
what
controls.
it
is
not
what
action,
who
has
been
exercising
jurisdiction
since
then,
and
we
know
that.
what
controls
is
what
happened
at
the
turn
of
the
century.
unfortunately,
it
is
people’s
lives
that
are
affected.
90%
of
those
people
out
there
are
non-indians,
and
i
am
not
impugning
any
bad
motives
at
that
time,
and
i
do
not
suggest
that
it
was
the
white
people
who
do
not
like
indians
or
who
want
to
harass
indians.
in
the
words
of
mr.
sonosky
when
he
started,
harassment
in
these
particular
counties,
these
same
forces
that
tried
to
stake
state
jurisdiction
or
behind
anything,
those
who
have
not
been
the
problems
that
we
have
had.
what
we
need
frankly
from
this
court,
what
we
need
from
the
government
is
a
consistent
policy,
because
what
happens
here
and
what
happens
in
the
congress
affects
us
in
our
daily
lives.
people
have
investments
out
there,
both
indian
and
non-indian.
people
have
their
families
out
there,
both
indian
and
non-indian.
we
cannot
continuously
be
trading
these
counties
back
and
forth,
or
changing
our
position
every
10,
15,
or
20
years,
and
expect
there
will
ever
to
be
a
lack
of
problems
out
there
in
that
particular
country.
they
can
talk
all
they
want
about
the
problems
that
we
had.
but
this
is
the
same
state
that
had
set
up
a
state
indian
task
force
that
involves
members
of
that
tribe.
believe
it
or
not,
we
have
our
own
negotiating
committee
on
the
state
level,
the
only
one
in
the
union
to
sit
down
with
these
tribes
and
try
to
negotiate
these
problems
out,
but
we
cannot
do
it
if
the
policy
of
the
federal
government
is
always
going
to
change.
the
important
thing
is,
let
us
see
exactly
what
congress
intended
at
the
turn
of
the
century.
sum
certain
is
not
an
important
aspect.
it
maybe
important,
as
it
frankly
looks
like
it
might
have
been
in
decoteau,
until
you
get
the
look
at
the
rosebud
documents.
unfortunately,
rosebud
lays
it
all
out
as
to
--
what
to
some
certain
aspect
was
it.
all
it
was
was
a
vehicle
to
facilitate
the
change.
they
say
that
over
and
over
and
over,
and
not
even
the
indian
people
objected
to
that,
at
the
time
that
these
conversations
went
on.
everybody
understood
what
happened.
i
understand
the
court
wants
to
go
home,
i
have
got
time,
but
i
would
not
use
it.
unless
there
is
any
question,
that
is
all
that
i
have.
thank
you
very
much.
