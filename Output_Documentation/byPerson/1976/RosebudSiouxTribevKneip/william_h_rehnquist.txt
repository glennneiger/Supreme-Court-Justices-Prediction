mr.
sonosky,
was
the
land
under
the
1904

ultimately
sold?
justice

rehnquist
and
were
the
proceeds
of
those
sales
credited
to
the
tribe?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
those
words
you
are
referring
to
certainly
did
not
mean
that
the
entire
area
was
sold
and
conveyed
at
that
time.
justice

h.
rehnquist
what
were
you
reading
the
words,
that
you
just
read?

the
rosebud
sioux
reservation
is
located
in
the
southwestern
part
of
south
dakota
and
is
established
in
1989
consisted
of
all
our
part
of
five
counties
in
that
state.
three
acts
passed
by
congress
in
1904,
1907
and
1910
open
for
settlement
reservation
land
and
for
the
five
counties
that
has
not
been
allotted
to
the
indians.
to
determine
whether
these
acts
had
also
removed
these
counties
from
the
reservation,
the
rosebud
sioux
tribe
filed
this
suit
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
south
dakota
claiming
that
the
original
boundaries
of
their
rosebud
sioux
reservation
had
not
been
diminished
by
those
acts.
the
district
court
found
that
the
intent
of
congress
had
been
to
diminish
the
reservation
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
for
the
reasons
expressed
and
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
we
now
affirmed
that
judgment.
under
the
prior
opinions
of
this
court,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
boundaries
of
an
indian
reservation
were
diminished
is
a
question
of
congressional
intent.
while
we
do
not
likely
conclude
that
congress
intended
to
diminish
the
reservation
boundaries,
we
are
required
to
conclude
that
it
did
so
if
the
language
and
surroundings
circumstance
demonstrate
that
congress
so
intended.
our
examination
of
the
language,
the
legislative
history
and
the
background
of
the
acts
convinces
us
that
congress
did
intend
to
remove
the
four
counties
and
dispute
from
the
rosebud
sioux
reservation.
our
conclusion
is
to
the
intent
of
congress
is
buttress
by
the
fact
that
the
state
has
exercised
jurisdiction
over
these
counties
since
the
passage
of
the
acts
in
question.
this
longstanding
assumption
jurisdiction
by
the
state
of
south
dakota
over
the
area
not
only
demonstrates
the
parties'
understandings
of
the
consequences
of
the
acts,
but
also
has
created
justifiable
expectations.
the
reading
of
the
acts
urged
upon
us
by
the
tribe
is
too
strain
to
upset
this
jurisdictional
history.
and
we
hold
that
the
area
in
question
was
removed
from
the
rosebud
reservation
by
the
three
acts.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
stewart
joined.
