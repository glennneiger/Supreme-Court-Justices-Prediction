mr.
marvin
j.
sonosky
mr.
chief
justice,
members,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit.
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
three-fourths
of
the
rosebud
sioux
reservation
in
south
dakota
has
been
terminated
by
three
statutes
adopted
in
1904,
1907,
and
1910.
each
of
those
statutes
opened
a
portion
of
the
reservation
and
provided
for
the
sale
of
unreserved
and
unallotted
land
to
settlers,
had
prices
fixed
in
the
statute,
with
the
proceeds
of
the
sales,
and
this
is
important,
to
be
credited
to
the
tribe
in
the
treasury
only
as
received
from
the
settlers.
the
rosebud
sioux
tribe
is
a
part
of
the
great
sioux
nation,
one
of
the
important
american-indian
tribes.
there
is
an
armed
resident
population
of
about
7,000.
the
genesis
of
the
reservation
goes
back
to
the
1868
treaty
when
the
united
states
and
the
sioux
agree
to
the
establishment
of
the
great
sioux
reservation
which
embraces
all
of
south
dakota,
west
of
the
missouri
river,
about
25
million
acres.
the
treaty
provided
that
the
reservation
would
be
secure
to
them
and
never
any
part
of
it
would
be
taken
from
them
without
the
written
consent
of
at
least
three-fourths
of
the
male
adults.
in
1877,
nine
years
later,
the
united
states
took
7
million
acres
of
the
reservation.
that
left
about
18
million
acres.
in
1889,
the
united
states
enacted
the
statute
of
that
year,
to
which
the
sioux
agreed,
with
the
three-fourths
majority
and
half
the
land
roughly,
but
9
million
acres
was
explicitly
restored
to
the
public
domain
with
the
provision
that
it
would
be
disposed
off,
and
the
proceeds
credited
to
the
tribe.
this
is
important,
at
the
end
of
ten
years,
any
of
the
land
left
the
united
states
would
make
a
balloon
payment
and
pay
for
all
that
was
undisposed
of.
as
to
the
other
9
million
acres,
that
was
divided
into
six
reservations,
all
for
the
sioux
tribes.
one
of
those
six
reservations
was
for
the
rosebud
sioux
tribe.
the
1889
act
provide
for
allotments,
and
the
allotment
process
went
forward
shortly
after
the
1889
act
became
effective.
in
the
back
of
the
greene
brief,
which
is
our
opening
brief,
there
is
a
map
about
the
year
of
1913,
which
shows
the
reservation
as
established
by
the
1889
act.
it
includes,
starting
from
the
eastern
end,
portions
of
gregory
and
lyman
county,
then
tripp
county,
then
mellette
county
and
todd
county.
now,
these
counties
of
course
all
came
after
the
reservation.
mr.
marvin
j.
sonosky
i
do
not
know
how
many
counties
are
in
south
dakota,
your
honor.
i
am
sure
the
attorney
general
maybe
able
to
tell
you.
mr.
marvin
j.
sonosky
after
the
1889
act
they
were
organized.
as
i
say,
the
allotment
process
went
forward.
in
1901,
the
united
states
undertook
to
take
a
cession,
an
outright
purchase,
by
the
eastern
portion
of
the
reservation;
parts
of
gregory
and
lyman
counties.
an
agreement
was
negotiated
in
that
year
which
provided
for
the
outright
cession,
sale,
conveyance,
and
surrender
of
the
land,
about
450,000
acres,
as
i
recall,
for
a
lump
sum
of
$1,040,000.00,
and
the
indians
consented
to
that,
again,
three-fourths
majority.
the
agreement
provided
that
it
would
not
be
effective
until
the
indians
consented
and
until
it
was
ratified
by
congress.
it
went
to
washington,
and
it
was
sent
to
congress
for
ratification.
the
house
was
willing
to
adopt
the
simple
ratification
bill
but
the
senate
insisted
in
two
amendments.
one
of
which
was
to
grant
the
state
all
sections,
16
and
36,
the
school
lands,
and
the
other
one
of
which
was
to
open
up
the
lands
for
free
homesteads.
there
was
resistance
to
this
on
the
ground
that,
since
we
paid
tax
money
for
this
indian
land,
we
ought
not
to
be
giving
it
away,
and
it
failed.
ultimately,
there
was
a
compromise
and
the
1904
act
was
enacted.
the
1904
act,
which
is
set
up
in
our
brief,
and
the
appendix
to
the
greene
brief
page
1a.
the
1904
act,
the
format
of
that
act
is
very
interesting,
because
the
act
itself
provides
that
the
land
should
be
opened
and
disposed
of
at
the
statutory
price,
and
the
proceeds
credited
to
the
tribe
only
as
received
from
the
settlers.
but
the
act
opens
by
setting
out
in
the
preamble
preceding
the
enactment
clause,
the
1901
agreement,
just
as
it
had
been
consented
to
by
the
indians.
then
comes
the
enactment
clause,
and
then
follows
the
agreement
again,
except
this
time
they
leave
out
one
article.
it
is
amended.
they
amend
the
agreement
to
strip
it
of
the
article
that
required
the
union’s
consent
and
the
ratification
by
congress,
and
they
make
another
amendment
which
was,
we
are
not
going
to
pay
you
a
$1,040,000.00
for
it.
what
we
are
going
to
do
is
open
up
this
land
and
dispose
of
it,
and
as
it
is
sold,
the
proceeds
will
be
credited
to
you
only
as
received.
that
was
in
1904
act.
that
took
care
of
gregory
and
lyman
on
the
eastern
end.
incidentally,
the
best
land,
of
course.
in
1907,
before
the
indians
had
received
dollar
one…
mr.
marvin
j.
sonosky
practically
--
my
recollection
is
that
practically
all
of
that
was
sold.
mr.
marvin
j.
sonosky
yes,
i
suppose
these
were
credited
to
the
tribe.
in
1907,
before
they
had
received
any
money
from
the
sales
of
these
lands,
the
1907
act
was
passed
and
opened
up
tripp
county
in
the
same
way,
same
type
of
statute.
we
refer
to
them
as
surplus
land
statutes
on
the
theory
that
there
were
surplus
to
the
indian’s
needs,
and
they
were
disposed
off
to
the
settlers
and
proceeds
credited
as
received.
in
1910,
it
was
the
third
statute
which
covered
mellette
county,
and
that
left
todd
county,
which
was
never
affected
by
a
statute,
although
efforts
were
made
to
obtain
a
similar
statute
for
todd
county.
now,
each
one
of
these
three
statutes,
except
for
the
1904
act,
provided
for
allotments.
the
1904
act,
the
allotments
have
already
been
made
because
it
started
out
as
a
cession,
provided
for
allotments
to
all
indians
in
the
area
to
be
opened,
before
it
was
opened.
each
one
of
them
provided
for
a
grant
to
the
state
of
the
school
sections
16
and
36,
the
united
states
paid
for
that
land,
$2.50
an
acre.
the
statutes
also
provided
other
benefits.
but
in
order
to
make
absolutely
clear
that
the
united
states
was
not
buying
this
land,
that
the
indians
were
not
selling
this
land,
that
the
united
states
was
not
paying
for
this
land,
each
one
of
these
statutes
in
the
last
section,
and
you
can
take
any
one
of
them,
the
first
one
on
page
6a,
provided
that
nothing
in
the
statute
shall
in
any
manner
barring
the
united
states
to
buy
the
land.
the
united
states
was
not
a
purchaser,
and
it
went
on
to
say
that
the
united
states
does
not
guarantee
to
find
purchasers
for
this
land.
it
went
on
to
say
it
again,
that
the
united
states,
all
its
doing
here
is
acting
as
a
trustee
to
open
up
this
land
and
dispose
of
it
and
credit
the
tribe
with
the
proceeds
only
as
received.
mr.
marvin
j.
sonosky
yes,
your
honor,
the
land
was
opened
up
and
it
was
disposed
off
until
1934
when
the
indian
reorganization
act
was
passed,
at
which
time
congress
provided
that
any
land
in
this
type
of
reservation
that
were
undisposed
of,
should
be
restored
to
the
tribe.
and
at
that
time
this
was
restored
to
the
rosebud
tribe
all
undisposed
of
lands.
there
were
undisposed
lands
in
tripp
county
and
mellette
county,
and
i
just
do
not
remember
if
there
were
any
in
gregory
county.
at
the
same
time
that
was
restored
to
the
rosebud
tribe,
it
was
also
restored
to
some
26
other
tribes
who
fall
in
the
same
category.
mr.
marvin
j.
sonosky
i
am
sure
the
state
would
not
argue
they
are
outside
the
reservation
because
they
are
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
the
1889
act,
and
the
indian
reorganization
act
limited
the
authority
to
restore
only
to
reservations.
now,
1910,
as
far
as
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
is
concerned
and
the
department
of
the
interior,
this
entire
area
is
fixed
by
the
1889
act,
it
was
administered
as
an
indian
reservation.
the
tribe
itself
regarded
all
of
the
people
who
live
within
those
boundaries
as
living
on
the
reservation.
in
1953,
congress
passed
what
to
indians
is
the
infamous
public
law
280,
which
authorizes
state
to
take
jurisdiction
for
indians
on
a
reservation
without
their
consent.
the
state
of
south
dakota
in
1962
undertook
to
do
that
by
an
act
of
the
legislature.
but
the
people
of
the
state
of
south
dakota
in
a
referendum
repudiated
that
act
and
set
it
aside
by
a
vote,
as
i
recall,
of
almost
four
to
one.
mr.
marvin
j.
sonosky
south
dakota
is
not
a
280
state,
because
that
failed.
mr.
marvin
j.
sonosky
because
of
that
referendum.
mr.
marvin
j.
sonosky
otherwise
it
would
have
been.
mr.
marvin
j.
sonosky
it
is
not.
mr.
marvin
j.
sonosky
right.
now,
i
mention
it
only
because
the
same
interest
that
were
moving
that
law
continued
to
feel
the
same
way,
and
there
was
harassment,
and
the
state
and
counties
continued
to
enforce
their
laws
against
indians
living
on
the
reservation.
finally,
this
suit
was
instituted
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
south
dakota,
and
the
complaint
alleged,
and
i
mention
this
because
it
defines
the
only
issue
that
is
before
the
court,
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
state
and
counties
were
enforcing
state
laws
against
indians
on
the
open
portions
of
the
reservation,
and
that
the
state
had
no
authority,
and
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment
to
that
effect.
the
state
answered
and
admitted
that
it
was
enforcing
the
laws
only
on
non-trust
land
within
the
open
areas.
the
district
court
rendered
a
judgment,
which
is
very
broad,
and
the
judgment
appears
on
the
red
appendix
to
the
petition,
page
114.
the
district
court
held
that
the
three
acts
in
question
did
extinguish
the
reservation
or
indian
land
nature
of
the
unallotted
surplus
lands
in
the
said
counties
by
returning
them
to
the
public
domain,
and
did
diminish
the
geographical
location
of
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation.
on
appeal
the
court
of
appeals,
after
the
case
was
submitted
in
the
oral
argument,
held
the
case
until
this
court
came
down
on
this
decision
in
decoteau
county
state
court.
after
decoteau
came
down,
the
court
of
appeals
rendered
its
opinion.
it
held
that
these
three
--
that
first
with
the
1904
act,
that
the
1904
act
ratified
the
1901
agreement
and
that
it
was
a
cession.
that
the
1907
act
used
the
identical
language
of
cession,
as
did
the
1904
act,
there
is
no
language
of
cession
in
the
1907
act.
that
the
1910
act
used
identical
words,
whatever
it
was
meant,
it
did
not
say
words
of
cession,
but
identical
words,
and
it
held
that
the
reservation
had
been
terminated.
how
did
the
court
of
appeals
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
a
cession?
a
cession
is
a
sale,
it
is
a
high
class
sale,
it
is
a
sale
between
sovereigns.
to
have
a
sale,
you
have
to
have
a
seller,
and
you
have
to
have
a
buyer.
if
you
have
a
seller
and
a
buyer,
you
have
an
agreed
price.
then,
you
will
have
a
sale
and
a
cession.
section
6,
the
last
section
of
each
one
of
these
three
surplus
land
acts,
says
in
so
many
words
that
the
united
states
is
not
buying
this
land.
we
are
not
even
guaranteeing
to
find
buyers
for
this
land.
all
we
are
doing
here
is
agreeing
to
dispose
of
the
land
and
credit
the
proceeds,
and
there
are
reservations,
if
the
court
please,
in
particular
the
wind
river
reservation,
where
the
same
type
of
statute
opened
the
land,
and
only
a
little
over
10%
of
the
land
was
ever
sold,
and
the
other
90%
after
the
indian
reorganization
act
was
restored
to
the
tribe.
how
could
the
court
reach
that?
the
court
assumed
there
was
a
cession.
that
is
the
fundamental
error
in
the
court’s
below.
no
where
in
those
opinions
is
there
any
explanation
of
how
title
got
out
of
the
tribe
into
the
united
states,
and
how
do
the
court’s
below
square
their
action
with
the
language
in
the
last
section
of
these
statutes.
mr.
marvin
j.
sonosky
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
j.
sonosky
they
were
the
property
of
the
tribe,
they
were
the
property
of
the
tribe,
the
beneficial
title
to
those
lands
never
left
the
tribe.
all
that
happened
is
that
those
lands
were
subject
to
a
statute
that
left
them
open
for
disposal,
but
until
they
were
disposed
off
the
tribe
remained
the
beneficial
owner.
proof
of
that
is
that
this
court
held
in
the
united
states
v.
creek
nation,
which
is
cited
in
our
briefs,
where
there
was
a
mistake
made
by
the
united
states
surveyor
in
the
line
of
the
reservation,
and
he
puts
reservation
land
out
into
the
public
domain,
and
it
was
disposed
off
by
the
united
states.
when
the
tribe
sued
to
recover
for
just
compensation,
the
question
arose
as
to
when
did
the
title
pass?
it
did
not
pass
when
the
erroneous
survey
was
made
because
that
was
a
mistake
of
a
federal
officer.
the
united
states
is
not
responsible
for
that.
but
when
the
patent
was
issued
to
the
entryman,
title
passed
and
values
were
determined
as
of
the
date
of
the
issuance
of
the
patent.
the
same
thing
is
true
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
each
one
of
these
acts
provides
that
until
that
entryman
does
all
that
he
is
required
to
do
in
terms
of
residence
and
settlement,
and
pays
for
the
land,
he
has
nothing.
thus
when
an
entryman
failed,
his
entry
was
canceled
and
the
statutes
that
each
of
them
provides,
the
land
goes
up
again
for
sale.
beneficial
title
never
left
the
tribe.
if
it
had
left
the
tribe,
instead
of
restoring
the
lands
to
the
tribe,
it
would
have
taken
an
act
of
congress
to
convey
the
lands
from
the
united
states
to
the
tribe.
mr.
marvin
j.
sonosky
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
have
been
a
cession,
and
we
said
that
in
our
briefs
to
the
court
of
appeals
before
this
court
came
down
with
decoteau,
because
there
was
an
agreement.
mr.
marvin
j.
sonosky
unmistakably,
clear
words
of
cession.
mr.
marvin
j.
sonosky
in
the
agreement,
and
there
was
an
agreed
price.
the
indians
were
transferring
their
land
and
the
united
states
was
giving
them
$1,040,000.00
for
it,
and
that
was
decoteau,
and
that
is
what
decoteau
stands
for.
mr.
marvin
j.
sonosky
before
decoteau.
mr.
marvin
j.
sonosky
and
the
amendment
was
to
strike
the
consent
and
ratification,
and
to
eliminate.
well,
they
might
as
well
just
throw
it
out.
what
they
were
really
doing
was
to
make
sure
that
the
opposition
understood
that
they
were
not
spending
tax
money
for
land.
this
is
the
format
they
adopted.
but
in
mattz
v.
arnett
and
seymour
v.
superintendent,
which
is
by
contrast
to
decoteau,
the
situation
that
we
have
here,
where
there
is
no
sale,
there
is
no
buyer,
there
is
no
agreed
price,
the
land
was
never
placed
in
the
public
domain,
indian
title
was
never
extinguished,
and
the
reservation
boundaries
were
never
terminated
or
affected,
and
that
is
the
controlling
principle,
is
to
cede
the
rosebud
case.
mr.
marvin
j.
sonosky
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
would
be
constitutionally
permissible
because
of
power
of
congress
over
indians
is
so
broad.
mr.
marvin
j.
sonosky
yes.
mr.
marvin
j.
sonosky
no,
and
since
then
we
have
had
a
statutory
definition
of
indian
country,
and
it
includes
all
end,
trust
or
non-trust.
that
is
18
u.s.c.
11…
mr.
marvin
j.
sonosky
except
that
this
court
has
applied
it
in
all
cases.
it
has
not
made
the
distinction.
the
court
has
applied
it
in
all
cases.
the
court
applied
in
mattz
v.
arnett
and
seymour
v.
superintendent.
the
reason
for
it
is
that
they
just
got
sick
and
tired
of
having
law
officers
running
around
and
abstract
of
title
in
their
properties
to
find
out
whether
there
was
or
was
not
untrust
land.
it
is
pretty
hard
to
figure
that
out
even
when
you
are
living
on
the
reservation,
and
in
order
to
permit
effective
prosecution
of
the
law,
that
was
done.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
j.
sonosky
i
have
listened
to
the
attorney
general’s
conversation,
and
much
of
it
is
a
certiorari,
not
supported
by
the
record,
not
supported
in
fact.
i
would
indulge
the
court
not
to
give
heed
to
these
white
statements
that
are
being
made.
we
do
have
a
principle
established,
and
it
is
decoteau,
and
it
is
mattz,
and
it
is
seymour,
and
if
those
principles
do
not
control,
then
every
one
of
these
20
reservations
that
we
found
with
identical
statutes
to
rosebud,
is
going
to
have
to
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
things
that
are
extrinsic
to
this
statute.
i
did
not
hear
the
attorney
general
explain
to
the
court
what
that
last
of
our
statutes
meant,
where
the
united
states
said
it
was
not
a
purchaser.
you
cannot
avoid,
you
cannot
get
title
if
you
do
not
buy
it,
and
that
includes
the
united
states.
nor
did
the
court
of
appeals
touched
that
statute,
nor
did
it
touch
that
section,
nor
did
the
district
court.
when
the
court
looks,
the
reference
was
made
here
to
a
1903
agreement,
they
did
go
back
and
get
an
agreement
from
the
indians
in
1903,
and
got
a
majority
vote.
but
significantly,
congress
did
not
put
that
in
the
1904
act,
the
one
they
put
in
the
1904
act
was
the
one
where
they
got
the
three-fourths
majority,
because
that
was
the
only
one
that
was
valid.
lone
wolf
simply
says
that
congress
has
the
constitutional
power
to
do
what
it
wants
with
indian
land
without
indian’s
consent.
lone
wolf
does
not
substitute
a
majority
for
three-fourths.
thank
you.
