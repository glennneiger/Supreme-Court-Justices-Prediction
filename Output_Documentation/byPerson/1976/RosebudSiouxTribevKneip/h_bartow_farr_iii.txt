mr.
h.
bartow
farr
there
are
indians
within
the
disputed
area,
but
i
think
the
area
is
largely
occupied
by
whites,
who
purchased
or
are
successors
of
the
people
who
purchased
the
open
land.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
the
tribe
and
federal
government
or
the
state,
yes.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
well,
this
is
a
question
which
i
think
the
record
is
unclear
on
mr.
justice
powell.
essentially,
the
united
states
understands
the
position,
of
course
not
having
been
the
party
to
the
suit
throughout.
there
has
been
some
exercise
of
jurisdiction
by
the
states.
they
have
been
taking
the
position
that
this
is
land
outside
of
an
indian
reservation
which
their
jurisdiction
applies.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
i
believe
that
the
state
has
gone
ahead
and
imposed
state
criminal
law,
as
well
as
though,
i
think
the
federal
government
and
us
attorneys
have
also
imposed
federal
law,
that
there
is
basically
been
kind
of
a
working
relationship
in
this
area.
i
am
not
sure
how
much
of
this
is
reflected
by
the
record,
but
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
that
is
generally
what
should
happen.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
we
are
not.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
that
is
right.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
is
appearing
this
afternoon
as
amicus
curiae
in
support
of
the
position
of
the
rosebud
sioux
tribe,
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
should
be
reversed.
we
think
that
under
the
principle
set
forth
by
this
court
in
previous
cases,
particularly
in
seymour,
mattz,
and
decoteau.
it
is
clear
that
the
acts
of
1904
and
1970
and
1910
did
not
disestablish
the
boundaries
of
the
rosebud
sioux
reservation
in
the
areas
to
which
they
apply.
i
would
like
to
note
briefly
at
the
outset
one
important
general
point,
in
suggesting
that
congress
did
not
disestablish
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation
in
the
early
1900s,
we
do
not
mean
to
imply
that
congress
expected
that
those
boundaries
and
the
boundaries
of
comparable
reservations
were
going
to
continue
indefinitely.
we
agree
that
in
the
early
1900s,
congress
contemplated
at
some
period
of
time
that
the
reservation
system
would
in
fact
come
to
an
end.
but
we
believe
that
time
was
when
the
trust
period
on
indian
allotments
expired
and
the
assimilation
of
indians
and
white
settlers
on
the
lands
had
been
accomplished.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
that
is
correct,
that
congress
at
some
point
would
have
found
that
the
assimilation
had
occurred,
and
would
have
passed
an
act
demolishing
the
reservation.
at
that
point,
all
of
these
lands
and
all
of
the
people
on
it,
except
if
the
federal
government
wished
to
retain
jurisdiction
over
the
indians,
would
have
gone
within
state
jurisdiction.
in
1934
however,
as
the
court
is
aware,
the
congress
reversed
that
policy,
it
went
and
passed
the
indian
reorganization
act
and
indefinitely
extended
he
trust
period
on
the
indian
allotments.
i
will
discuss
that
more
briefly
in
connection
with
the
general
allotment
act
of
1887.
because
this
case
involves
an
issue
of
statutory
interpretation,
the
united
states
does
not
urge
or
perhaps
even
believe
its
possible
for
this
court
to
lay
down
a
binding
fixed
rule
that
would
govern
construction
of
acts
on
all
similar
cases.
however,
we
do
believe
it
is
appropriate
for
this
court
to
reaffirm
the
principle
that
except
where
the
language
of
an
act
or
the
compelling
legislative
history
shows
a
clear
intention
by
congress
to
contract
reservation
boundaries
and
limit
federal
jurisdiction
over
certain
areas
of
indian
reservations,
that
whenever
congress,
without
a
binding
agreement,
opens
lands
to
white
settlers,
does
not
pay
for
them,
and
does
not
guarantee
any
payment,
but
only
agrees
to
act
as
trustee
for
future
uncertain
sales,
and
leaves
the
property
interest
in
the
indians,
as
they
did
in
this
case,
that
act
does
not
remove
the
lands
from
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation.
as
this
court
said
in
seymour,
discussing
an
act
with
a
very,
very
similar
terms,
the
purpose
of
the
1906
act
was
neither
to
destroy
the
existence
of
the
reservation,
nor
to
lessen
federal
responsibility
or
jurisdiction
over
the
indians
having
tribal
rights
on
that
reservation.
now,
this
principle
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
disestablish
the
reservation
does
not
warrant
that
the
government
is
made
up
out
of
whole
clause.
it
is
supported
both
by
history
and
by
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court.
to
begin
with,
it
is
well
recognized
that
the
tribes
are
entitled
to
rely
on
certain
rules
of
statutory
construction.
in
particular,
doubtful
expressions
are
to
be
resolved
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians.
more
particularly,
in
cases
of
this
type,
the
intent
to
disestablish
reservation
boundaries
must
be
made
clear,
either
from
the
act
or
the
legislative
history.
and
as
this
court
said
on
rice
v.
olson,
the
policy
of
leaving
indians
free
from
state
jurisdiction
and
control
is
deeply
rooted
in
the
nation’s
history.
all
of
these
rules
of
construction
apply
to
the
case
at
hand.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
certainly.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
those
facts
are
true,
yes,
but
in
terms
of
the
area
in
which
we
are
talking
about,
we
are
talking
about
a
considerable
area
of
land
on
which
indians
will
either
be
able
to
move
within
federal
jurisdiction
or
will
be
moving
within
state
jurisdiction.
of
course,
indians
do
have
allotments
within
those
open
areas.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
yes,
they
do.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
i
would
love
to
answer
that
question,
but
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
no.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
they
are
likely
to
be,
right,
i
mean
depending
on
the
settlement
practices
and
who
defaulted
and
who
did
not,
the
lands
that
would
be
left
available
were
likely
to
be
individual
tracks,
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
i
believe
that
there
is
a
figure
stated
in
one
of
the
opinions
below.
i
think
that
the
reservation
covers
about
7,000.
i
think
that
the
areas
that
we
are
talking
about,
the
counties
that
we
are
talking
about,
the
number
of
indians
are
somewhere
around
1,600
or
1,700,
i
think
that
is
reflected
in
the
record.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
well,
not
necessarily.
again,
they
maybe
indians
who
were
allotted
lands
at
the
time
that
these
areas
were
open.
when
the
areas
were
open,
indians
were
first
given
an
opportunity
to
select
allotments
within
those
areas.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
that
land
is
indian
country.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
dispute.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
i
do
not
know.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
well,
i
do
not
know
how
many
there
would
be,
but
i
think
--
i
might
just
say
that
the
principle
i
think
extends
further
than
that,
because
jurisdiction,
if
it
only
applies
on
allotments,
the
indians,
any
time
they
step
off
their
particular
allotments
on
the
territory
that
is
owned
by
a
white
settler,
may
at
that
point
be
subject
to
state
jurisdiction,
and
that
is
something
that
clearly
the
indians
do
not
want
in
the
interest
that
we
feel
we
ought
to
protect
in
this
case.
turning
to
the
general
allotment
act
of
1887,
briefly…
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
that
is
correct,
that
applies
in
the…
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
well,
there
can
be
fee
simple
and
non-indians
in
terms
of
land
ownership,
there
is
no
question.
however,
for
purposes
of
jurisdiction
that
is…
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
that
is
correct.
now,
the
definition
of
indian
country,
just
to
make
sure
that
i
have
answered
your
question
properly,
the
definition
of
indian
country
in
1151
includes
all
areas
including
patented
lands
within
a
reservation,
within
indian
country,
and
also,
in
the
allotments
outside
the
boundaries
and
reservations
within
indian
country.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
there
is
somewhere
around
16,000
whites
and
about
1,600
indians.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
i
believe
that
is
correct.
we
also
believe
in
addition
to
the
presumptions
that
i
discussed
a
minute
ago,
that
the
general
allotment
act
of
1887,
that
the
policies
and
objectives
of
that
are
consistent
with
the
principle
that
an
act
such
as
this
does
not
disestablish
reservation
boundaries.
although
respondents
in
their
brief
have
continually
turned
the
general
allotment
act
on
its
head,
saying
that
it
embodies
the
intent
of
congress
to
disestablish
reservations.
this
court
has
considered
that
precise
question
in
several
recent
cases
and
found
the
opposite
intent.
we
believe
the
court
correctly
identify
the
intent
of
the
general
allotment
act
only
last
term
in
moe
v.
confederated
salish
&
kootenai
tribes,
in
which
it
quoted
from
that
with
approval,
the
following
language.
“its
policy,
that
of
the
general
allotment
act
of
1887,
was
to
continue
the
reservation
system
and
the
trust
status
of
indian
lands,
but
to
allot
tracks
to
individual
indians
for
agriculture
and
grazing.
when
all
the
lands
had
been
allotted
and
the
trust
expired,
the
reservation
could
be
abolished”.
that
is
the
act
of
congress
that
i
said
in
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
unallotted
lands
were
made
available
to
non-indians
with
the
purpose
in
part
of
promoting
interaction
between
the
races
and
are
encouraging
indians
to
adopt
white
ways.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
that
is
1887.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
right.
in
fact,
respondents
have
said
that
the
sioux
act
was
in
fact
followed
along
from
that
general
plan.
we
think
that,
that
indicates
the
court
has
recognized
an
intent
to
retain
jurisdiction
and
control
over
those
lands
during
the
trust
period,
with
the
consideration
of
whether
to
end
the
reservation
to
be
made
at
a
later
time
when
the
assimilation
had
occurred.
we
think
the
court
has
noted
that
even
more
specifically
in
the
cases
in
which
we
very
heavily
rely
on
our
brief,
seymour
and
mattz,
and
also
in
decoteau,
which
distinguishes
both
cases
in
a
case
where
sale
is
made
for
a
sum
certain,
and
an
agreement
was
made
as
the
counsel
for
the
tribe
has
discussed.
in
addition
to
these
guiding
principles,
we
also
feel
that
the
legislative
history
and
the
administrative
treatment
that
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
supports
the
position
of
the
tribe.
the
remaining
question
then
is,
what
is
their
sufficient
to
override
this
and
the
materials
that
the
court
has
before
it?
most
importantly,
we
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
acts
that
says
specifically
that
jurisdiction
over
these
areas
was
to
be
given
to
the
states.
in
fact,
i
think
as
a
reading
of
the
legislative
history
shows,
congress
was
really
not
concerned
with
the
jurisdiction
at
this
point.
the
pressure
on
congress
was
to
open
up
lands
for
white
settlers
for
two
reasons.
one,
the
settlers
wanted
the
lands,
and
two,
the
counties
wanted
a
greater
tax
base.
both
of
those
objectives
could
be
met
perfectly
comfortably
by
congress,
by
opening
lands
within
the
reservation
boundaries,
without
sacrificing
the
principles
of
the
general
allotment
act
of
1887,
which
was
to
continue
the
reservations
during
the
period
of
assimilations.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
yes.
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
dispute
about
that,
that
was
considered
at
that
time,
and
i
believe
that
even
now
would
be
considered
land
that
is
within
the
power
of
the
states
to
tax.
in
decoteau
in
fact,
discussing
this
particular
conflict
of
policy,
the
court
said
in
1887,
the
general
allotment
act
was
enacted
in
an
attempt
to
reconcile
the
government’s
responsibility
for
the
indians’
welfare,
with
the
desire
of
non-indians
to
settle
upon
reservation
lands.
we
submit
in
this
case
that
the
best
way
to
reconcile,
that
was
in
the
way
that
congress
did
reconcile
throughout
this
period,
was
to
continue
the
reservation
system,
but
to
open
white
lands
so
that
they
would
have
a
taxable
base
for
the
county,
and
the
whites
would
have
the
additional
lands.
for
those
reasons,
as
my
time
is
getting
short,
i
will
close
and
simply
suggest
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
