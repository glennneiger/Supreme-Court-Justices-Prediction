unknown
speaker
how
many
counties
are
there
in
south
dakota?
unknown
speaker
this
came
after
1889?
unknown
speaker
now,
to
pursue
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question,
was
that
carried
out?
did
they
from
time
to
time
find
buyers,
did
the
buyers
pay,
did
the
money
go
to
the
tribe?
unknown
speaker
now,
does
the
state
argue
that
those
restored
lands
are
outside
the
reservation,
or
does
it
concede
that
they
are
inside
the
reservation?
unknown
speaker
i
understood
from
the
brief
that
south
dakota
does
not
appeal
280
states.
unknown
speaker
because
of
that
referendum.
unknown
speaker
i
see,
i
see.
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
not?
unknown
speaker
they
decided
against
it
then
and
never
has
been
ever
since?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sonosky,
can
i
interrupt
you
right
there.
you
referred
to
the
1934
indian
reorganization
act,
and
i
understood
you
to
say
that
pursuant
to
that
statute,
the
unsold
lands
were
restored
to
the
tribe.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
your
theory
is
correct,
why
were
not
those
unsold
lands
already
the
property
of
the
tribe?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
this
question
mr.
sonosky?
if
the
agreement
that
have
been
reached
between
inspector
mclaughlin,
and
three
quarters
of
the
adult
members
of
the
rosebud
sioux
tribe
back
in
1901,
had
been
accepted
in
the
form
in
which
it
was
negotiated
and
written,
would
that
have
been
a
cession?
unknown
speaker
and
very
clear
words
of
cession
were
there…
unknown
speaker
in
the
agreement?
unknown
speaker
right,
and
if
that
agreement
had
been
effectuated,
you
can
see
that
that
would
have
been
a
cession
under
decoteau,
or
you
say
you
conceded
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
before
decoteau?
unknown
speaker
and
then
the
1904
act,
the
congress,
the
senate,
and
the
house
of
representatives,
purported
to
accept,
ratify,
and
confirm
that
agreement,
but
then
they
said
as
herein
amended
and
modified,
and
that
is
your
case?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
another
question
mr.
sonosky?
supposing
we
were
persuaded
or
the
statute
expressly
provided,
that
upon
the
sales
over
a
period
of
time
to
individual
private
citizens
who
would
buy
the
land
through
the
government
as
trustee
for
the
indians,
that
as
each
parcel
were
sold,
the
reservation
would
be
diminished
to
that
extent,
and
that
you
therefore
have
a
gradual
diminution
of
the
boundaries
rather
than
the
wholesale
diminution
that
the
lower
court
found.
would
that
be
constitutionally
permissible?
unknown
speaker
the
reason
i
ask
you
is
that
some
of
the
legislative
history,
as
i
read
it,
would
be
consistent
with
the
congressional
understanding
of
that
being
what
was
actually
going
to
happen.
did
they
talk
about
diminished
reservation
and
change
boundaries
and
the
like?
unknown
speaker
that
i
realize
that
it
is
not
the
theory
of
the
court
below
or
the
government’s
theory?
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
for
purpose
of
criminal
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
in
you
view
it
would
have
taken
an
act
of
congress
later
than
to…
unknown
speaker
mr.
farr,
could
i
interrupt
you
right
there?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
the
geography,
we
are
really
not
talking
about
very
many
indians,
because
all
of
the
unsold
land
has
been
restored
to
the
indians,
and
all
of
the
land
which
was
sold
was
sold
to
whites,
isn’t
that
right?
unknown
speaker
within
the
open
areas?
unknown
speaker
could
you
clarify
one
thing?
what
portion
of
this
total
map
was
restored
in
1934?
how
much
of
the
original
reservation
is
in
dispute?
unknown
speaker
the
record
does
not
tell
us?
unknown
speaker
these
will
be
probably
noncontiguous
parcels,
wouldn’t
they
would
be
little
islands?
unknown
speaker
one
last
question
then,
does
the
record
tell
us
how
many
indians
live
on
the
lands
in
dispute?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
now,
those
would
be
indians
that
reacquired
lands
or
now
occupy
lands
which
were
originally…
unknown
speaker
but
would
not
by
virtue
of
those
allotments,
would
not
that
land
be
indian
country?
unknown
speaker
and
no
dispute
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
many
indians
occupy
land
over
which
there
is
a
dispute,
do
we
know
that?
unknown
speaker
there
would
be
very
few,
would
there
not?
unknown
speaker
so
in
other
words
the
non-reservation
land
can
be
at
is,
indian
country
if
it
is
owned
by
individual
indians?
unknown
speaker
and
by
the
same
token
or
the
other
side
of
the
same
coin,
within
a
reservation,
there
can
be
fee
simple
and
non-indians?
unknown
speaker
we
are
talking
now
about
the
geographic
boundaries
of
the
reservations.
unknown
speaker
so
within
a
reservation,
lands
owned
and
fee
simple
by
non-indians
is
still
indian
country?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
year
of
that
act?
unknown
speaker
87?
unknown
speaker
well,
could
the
counties’
tax
quite
owned
lands
within
the
reservation?
unknown
speaker
what
about
lyman?
unknown
speaker
lyman
is
what,
is
1904
act?
unknown
speaker
so
was
gregory?
unknown
speaker
general,
in
todd
county,
are
fee
owned
land
subject
to
county
taxation?
unknown
speaker
is
the
fee
owned
land
subject
to
tribal
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
that
has
taxation?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
this,
do
you
conceive
the
power
of
the
tribe
to
exercise
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
over
all
of
todd
county?
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
no
additional
issue
about
what
you
have
just
told
us
in
the
rest
of
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
janklow,
what
percentage
of
the
total
area
would
you
estimate
is
undisputed
indian
country?
unknown
speaker
right,
i
am
just
talking
about
the
three
counties.
unknown
speaker
general,
what
about
deeded
land
that
is
occupied
by
indians?
unknown
speaker
even
though
occupied
by
an
indian?
unknown
speaker
the
land
figure
that
you
gave
me
is
allotted.
unknown
speaker
is
this
where
the
tribe
was
initially?
unknown
speaker
were
they
moved,
were
the
indians
moved
there
from
some
other
area
or
was
this
their
ancestral
home?
unknown
speaker
the
entire
area
really
was
not
sold,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
4,000
acres
were
not
sold
at
that
time?
unknown
speaker
3
(a).
unknown
speaker
3(a)
of
the
petitioner’s
brief,
3(a)
of
the
tribe’s
brief.
unknown
speaker
what
area
did
that
refer
to?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
there
ever
any
land
that
was
sold
to
somebody?
unknown
speaker
the
point
you
are
making
though
is
that
those
words
--
you
say
those
words
meant
that
there
was
sold
to
the
united
states
the
entire
gregory
county,
at
that
time.
unknown
speaker
when
was
it
sold,
under
those
words?
unknown
speaker
as
of
the
time
the
act
was
passed
that,
that
entire
are
was
what,
was
ceded
by
the
indians?
unknown
speaker
at
that
time?
unknown
speaker
the
entire
are?
unknown
speaker
you
are
relying
rather
heavily
on
the
language,
that
you
just
did.
unknown
speaker
i
cannot
find
that
language
in
the
1907
or
the
1910
act.
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
in
the
1904
act,
not
by
anything
signed
by
the
indians,
but
it
is
signed
by
congress.
unknown
speaker
normally
when
a
grantor
sells
something,
he
signs
it.
unknown
speaker
here
it
says,
the
said
indians
do
hereby
cede,
surrender,
grant,
and
convey
to
the
united
states
all
their
claim,
right,
title
and
so
on,
and
that
is
enacted
by
congress,
that
is
not
signed
by
the
indian.
there
is
quite
a
little
difference
between
this
and
decoteau.
unknown
speaker
and
he
could
not
get
three
quarters
of
it.
unknown
speaker
under
a
recent
decision
of
this
court?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
the
then
recent
decision.
unknown
speaker
by
your
hypothesis
or
under
lone
wolf,
the
fact
that
they
got
a
majority
here
does
not
make
any
difference
either
if
not
one
indian
had
consented
to
it,
congress
still
would
have
had
the
authority.
unknown
speaker
nobody
did
consent
to
the
1907
and
1910,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
mr.
janklow,
isn’t
there
still
another
difference,
during
the
period
between
the
passage
of
the
statute,
say
the
1904
act,
and
the
actual
conveyance
of
real
estate
to
a
settler,
who
owned
the
real
estate?
unknown
speaker
the
answer
would
have
been
perfectly
clear
under
the
contract
as
negotiated
in
1901,
the
united
states
would
have
owned
it,
wouldn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
pursuant
to
the
1904
act,
the
united
states
was
the
grantor
of
its
own
interest
in
the
land?
unknown
speaker
what
happened
to
reservations
that
were
established
in
part…?
unknown
speaker
which
one
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
they
have
three
separate
partial
disestablishments.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
that
the
determining
time
was
when
the
land
was
sold
to
settlers?
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
held
it
forward.
unknown
speaker
well,
at
three
separate
times.
unknown
speaker
three
separate
instances.
unknown
speaker
let
us
suppose
it
is
very
improbable
that
none
of
the
land
was
ever
sold,
and
the
1934
act
was
never
passed,
and
right
now
there
would
never
have
been
any
sale
land,
nobody
wanted
it,
except
the
indians
wanted
it,
they
were
living
on
it.
but
under
your
position,
the
reservation
nevertheless,
would
have
been
disestablished
back
in
1904.
unknown
speaker
what
was
that
document,
that
concerning
document…
unknown
speaker
what
document
is
it?
unknown
speaker
what
were
the
pages
in
the
appendices?
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
i
mean
629,
and
you
say
that
is
a,
what?
unknown
speaker
committee
report?
unknown
speaker
did
that
case
came
here?
unknown
speaker
new
town.
