mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
not
a
case
of
an
invidious
sex
based
discrimination.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
the
finding,
which
was
made
by
the
district
court,
finding
no.
18
on
page
43(a)
of
the
petition
that
girls
high
school,
the
school
which
is
available
to
the
petitioners
“has
to
build
the
vision
of
many
19th
century
as
educators
both
men
and
women
by
becoming
the
equals
of
central
in
preparing
its
students
for
college.”
talking
about
a
high
school
here,
your
honors,
especially
in
all
academic
senior
high
school
function
of
which
is
to
prepare
students
for
college.
girls
high
school
and
central
high
school
are
equal
in
that
regard.
the
district
court
apparently
thought
that
there
was
a
constitutional
right
to
a
coeducational
academic
education
right
which
i
do
not
think
this
court
has
ever
found
and
said
that
it
did
not
have
to
take
into
account
the
existence
of
girls
high
school.
petitioner’s
desire
to
attend
central
high
school
was
sufficient
basis
for
its
decision
that
we
did
find
then
on
to
the
rational
relationship
standard
the
school
district’s
policy
passed
constitutional
muster
in
the
way
in
the
words
of
the
district
court.
your
honor,
essentially
girls
high
school
is
just
as
good
as
central
high
school.
the
only
finding
in
the
record
and
it
was
not
a
finding
that
was
the
basis
for
the
district
court’s
decision
concerns
the
science
facilities,
your
honors,
and
that
finding
apparently
is
based
on
statement
by
a
student
who
was
witnessed
for
the
petitioners
that
central
has
a
student-built
cyclotron
and
a
classroom
planetarium.
there
is
nothing
else
in
the
record
concerning
the
science
facilities
and
in
the
record
is
the
very
expensive
science
program
available
for
females
at
girls
high
school.
the
course
list,
which
is
in
the
record
in
exhibit
d2,
is
quite
expensive,
really
more
expensive
than
that
available
at
central
high
school.
but
essentially
we
are
dealing
with
two
institutions
which
are
equal
in
preparing
the
students
for
college.
at
one
point
the
district
judge
said,
they
were
comparable
and
either
statement
of
the
comparison
between
the
two
schools
were
satisfied
that
they
are
substantially
equal.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
no
sir,
it
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
yes,
in
the
statement
of
the
case
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
summarized
the
party’s
position
that
the
schools
for
boys
and
girls
are
comparable
in
quality,
academic
standing,
and
prestige,
that
is
a
5(a)
of
the
petition.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
your
honor,
i
think
the…
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
we
are
not
arguing
that
the
two
institutions
in
question
are
identical.
obviously,
they
are
two
separate
institutions.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
that’s
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
really
is
about
the
only
difference,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
and
there
probably
are….
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
i
think
that
was
in
the...
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
i
think
the
record
does
show
that,
your
honor,
but
there
are
additions….
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
your
honor,
as
i
suggest
that
finding
is
not
in
that
particular
relevance
in
this
case…
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
you
have
a
case
of
equal
schools,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
you
are
right,
your
honor.
except
for
finding
51,
which
i
think
well,
not
specifically
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
that
was
the
finding
on
the
academic
quality
of
the
other
high
schools,
the
comprehensive
high
schools,
we
alleged
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
other
high
schools
have
within
them
academic
programs
if
you
will
along
with
the
general
course
of
study
for
students
who
are
not
interested
in
going
to
college,
but
that
these
academic
programs
with
equal
of
central
and
girls
high
school
in
preparing
students
for
college
and
the
finding
of
the
statement
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
the
comprehensive
schools
provide
a
wide
range
of
courses
including
those
required
for
college
admissions,
for
advanced
placement
classes
for
students
who
are
intellectually
able
to
progress
at
a
faster
than
average
rate,
that’s
at
2(a)
and
3(a)
of
the
petition.
it
is
pointed
by
the
petitioner,
the
named
petitioner
who
probably
desire
not
to
go
to
girls
high
school,
went
to
a
comprehensive
high
school,
george
washington
high
school
and
was
able
from
that
school
to
go
to
the
university
of
pennsylvania
and
skipped
a
senior
year
in
high
school.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
i
think
they
are
essentially
used
in
that
term,
in
that
sense
comparable
in
this
case
means
essentially
equal.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
for
purposes
of
this
case,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
the
same.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
comparable,
i
think
that
perhaps
the
court
having
used
the
equal
in
the
one
finding,
finding
#18,
the
district
court
that
is,
your
honor,
probably
should
have
used
it
throughout
consistently;
however,
it
did
make
the
finding
that
the
two
schools
are
equal
in
preparing
students
for
college
irrespective
of
whether
central
or
girls
may
have
one
or
more
teachers
in
a
particular
department
different
from
--
they
are
not
the
identical
school.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
no,
i
don’t
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
it
said
scientific
facilities
the
scientific
program,
your
honor,
is
a
quite
a
different
story.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
finding
of
the
district
court
was
that
the
courses
at
the
two
schools
are
comparable
and
of
equal
quality.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
i
don’t
mean
if
the
argument
did,
your
honor,
but…
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
that
is
not
the
finding,
your
honor.
the
finding
is
that…
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
scientific
facilities,
it’s
not
science
program
or
course,
science
program
or
courses
at
girls
high
maybe
superior
to
that
at
central
high
school.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
scientific
facilities,
your
honor,
not
science
program.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
the
finding
was
on
scientific
facilities.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
why
the
schools
equal,
your
honor?
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
your
honor,
the
school
district
here
is
perusing
a
respected
pedagogical
method
and
that
is
something
which
has
been
stipulated
to
by
the
petitioners.
it
is
perusing
a
policy
in
its
academic,
in
high
schools
they
are
providing
an
option
for
students
they
can
either
take
the
comprehend
and
go
into
their
comprehensive
high
school
and
pick
the
academic
program
there
in
their
coeducational
for
the
most
part
or
they
can
go
to
a
single
sex
school.
there
is
evidence
in
the
case
not
just
stipulations,
your
honor.
recent
studies
that
we
were
done
suggesting
and
supporting
doctor
james
coleman(ph)
study
that
coeducation
maybe
inimical
to
academic
achievement
and
social
adjustment.
with
those
kinds
of
evidence
in
the
case,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
perfectly
reasonable
for
school
district
to
make
this
option
available.
it
is
i
think
hardly
relevant.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
i
don’t
agree
with
your
hour’s
assumption
there.
i
think
that…
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
well
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
record
demonstrates
that…
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
your
honor
my
thing
is...
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
you
may
have
heard
under
the
name
philadelphia
high
school
for
girls.
apparently
that
name,
girls
high
has
become
a
pejorative
term
for
the
petitioners
in
their
brief
to
this
court
and
i
think
it
is
a
rather
proud
name.
there
is
in
the
record
evidence
that
community
leaders
including...
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
because,
your
honor,
there
is
relevant,
i
think
highly
relevant
pedagogical
reasons
for
making
the
option
available
of
single
sex
education
something
which
this
record
demonstrates
is
relevant
to
the
school
district’s
basic
purposes
of
providing
educational
options
and
the
best
education
available
to
parents
and
students
and
educators
who
may
wish
to
avail
themselves
of
that
option.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
your
honor,
yes
the...
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
your
honor,
the
pertinent
comprising
would
be
between
central
and
girls
high
school
and
the
academic
students
at
the
comprehensive
high
schools
and
no
such
study
was
done
a
study.
a
study
was
entered
between
and
there
is
the
evidence
comparing
the
comprehensive
high
schools
in
total
to
from
girls..
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
your
honors,
the
major
premise
is
the
one
which
i
would
not
agree
with.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
if
that
were
the
case,
your
honor
then
i
would
agree
that
there
would
only
be
the
two
schools
to
go
to.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
and
that
would
be
correct
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
yes
your
honor,
the
opinion
of
this
court,
decision
of
this
court
in
various
cases
–
as
recently
as
san
antonio
independent
school
district
v.
rodriguez
has
stated
that
it
is
important
for
the
local
educational
bodies
to
have
the
ability
to
be
flexible
and
that
in
its
approach
to
educational
methodologies
as
long
as
there
is
no
inequality,
no
invidious
discrimination
between
individuals.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
separate
sexes
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
these
two
schools
have
been
an
existence
for
a
100
years.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
this
particular
mode
of
education
i
think
is
being
reevaluated
and
reexamined
as
recently
as
the
last
month
in
the
study
which
i
cited
in
the
brief,
educators
have
come
out
with
a
conclusion
that
it
maybe
better
for
students
to
be
educated
at
single
sex
schools
and
just
because
the
policy
evolved
in
the
nineteenth
century
as
we
admit
that
it
did,
does
not
mean
that
educators
cannot
reexamine
it
and
experiment
again
with
it.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
i
would
agree
your
honor
and
that
maybe
particularly
true
in
education.
educators
have
an
ability
to
reexamine
their
prior
methodologies
and
say
that
they
would
like
to
try
different
type
of
education
and
maybe
this
would
be
better.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
your
honor
the
record
doesn’t
tell
us
that,
but
the
school
board
every
year
passes
on
the
budget
for
the
schools...
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
well
your
honor,
the
board
directly
defends
to
this
case.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
not
on
the
record
your
honor,
but
the.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
when
the
superintendent
of
schools,
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
board
stated
in
his
deposition
testimony
that
the
advantage
of
the
two
schools
and
this
in
the
record
indeed,
as
an
educator
he
explained
that
its
parents
and
students
–
providing
for
parents
and
students
an
option,
then
the
students
and
parents
that
prefer
that
kind
of
atmosphere
speaking
of
single
sex
schools.
i
think
we
can
do
well
to
provide
that
for
those
who
want
the
opportunity,
so
is
something
which
the
educational
people
in
the
school
district
have
been
examining
it
throughout.
i
am
sure
there
is
a
debate
even
in
a
school
district,
though
there
is
co
education
or
single
sex,
only
get
educators
together
--
there
is
lot
of
controversy.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
i
think
the
burden,
i
think
the
school
district
would
not
particularly
concern
but
you
have
the
burden
of
proof
in
this
matter
nor
was
he
going
to
stand
on
that…
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
to
show
that
it
is
not
arbitrary
or
capricious,
i
think
that
is
the
extent
of
the
burden
that
we
had
and
i
think
we
show
that
this
is
no
an
invidious
discrimination
case,
i
do
not
think
we
had
to
go
any
higher
than
that,
we
did
go
higher
than
that.
we
showed
that
the
classification
is
highly
relevant…
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
i
think
that
the
–
that
all
we
had
to
show
was
a
rational
basis.
it
was
done
in
williams
v.
mcnair
stipulation.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
until
we
have
to
show
because
there
is
not
an
invidious
discrimination
here,
and
perhaps
this
court
has
recently
stated
in
craig
v.
boren.
that
way
there
is
an
invidious
discrimination,
perhaps
there
is
a
higher
standard
but
this
is
not
that
case
your
honor.
the
case,
the
most
relevant
president
in
this
particular
matter.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
i
think
that
only
the
thing
that
trial
of
the
fact
was
to
determine,
was
whether
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
for
this
case
not
whether
there
was
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
in
a
negligence
matter
or
beyond
the
reason
without
an
criminal
matter.
we
are
just
trying
to
show
that
we
are
not
acting
arbitrarily
or
capriciously,
i
think
we
did
that.
the
district
court
said
we
did
that
by
virtue
of
the
stipulations,
we
can
add
in
there,
the
testimony
of
the
exhibit
from
dr.
jones
who
performed
the
study
which
really
proved
the
dr.
james
coleman’s(ph)
concerning
the
single
sex
and
coeducation.
there
is
a
controversy
here,
your
honors.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
i
must
speak
the
record
shows
us
that
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
at
the
time
of
this
litigation,
your
honor,
they
were.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
yes,
at
the
time
of
the
litigation,
these
two
schools
had
less
than
capacity
enrolment.
that
is
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
gilbert
from
that
we
could
nearly
conclude
that
some
part
of
persons
were
passing
up
the
opportunity
nor
that
philadelphia
lacked
the
exceptional
--
and
i
think
that
we
can
conclude
anything
about
it.
