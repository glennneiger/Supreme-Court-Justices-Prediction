unknown
speaker
when
you
say
that
history
and
the
character.
unknown
speaker
would
you
--
and
for
me
it
has
not
been
and
obviously
was
not
in
existence
as
long
but
what
do
you
mean
by
the
history
and
the
character?
unknown
speaker
history
and
all
--
are
you
referring
to
its
reputation
and
standing?
unknown
speaker
for
training
leaders
or
for
training
exceptional
boys?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallis
if
the
training
at
central
high
and
the
training
at
girls
high
was
identical,
would
you
still
be
here?
unknown
speaker
i
said
identical.
unknown
speaker
that’s
my
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
arguing
that
this
is
unequal.
that’s
what
i
want
to
know,
are
you
arguing
unequal
or
not?
unknown
speaker
let
me
extend
mr.
justice
marshall’s
hypothetical
a
little.
suppose
as
with
some
of
the
schools,
they
decided
that
four
hours
a
day
was
enough
class
time
for
the
students
and
in
the
same
building
under
the
same
name
with
the
same
faculty,
you
had
the
boys
go
to
school
from
eight
until
twelve
and
the
girls
go
to
school
from
one
until
five.
then
i
would
think
you
would
agree
that
--
perhaps
you
would
not
that
this
is
identical
which
to
say
what
could
be
the
problem
in
your
view.
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
i
was.
unknown
speaker
same
building,
same
curricula,
all
the
way
through
same
teachers,
everything
identical
except
boys
in
the
morning,
girls
in
the
afternoon.
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
your
case
is
all
about?
unknown
speaker
are
you
arguing
for
a
coeducational
education.
unknown
speaker
i
think
it
is
of
some
importance
to
identify
what
this
case
is
about.
the
chief
justice’s
question
was
directed
to
determining
whether
this
is
a
separate
but
equal
case
and
whether
it
separate
but
equal
violates
the
constitution
or
whether
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
a
somewhat
simpler
case
and
that
is
that
the
best
high
school
in
philadelphia
excludes
girls
because
they
are
girls
which
is
quite
a
different
case.
unknown
speaker
which
case,
which…
unknown
speaker
fine.
unknown
speaker
the
difficulty
with
your
position
is
that
is
not
the
approach
the
district
court
talk
and
it
certainly
is
not
the
approach
that
the
court
of
appeals
talk.
unknown
speaker
the
district
court
said
separate
but
equal
is
not
bad
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
is
okay.
neither
of
the
court
said
there
was
inequality.
unknown
speaker
and
so,
you
want
us
to
find
within
the
first
instance.
unknown
speaker
for
us
to
make
a
legal
conclusion
to
the
effect
that
you
want.
unknown
speaker
but
why
should
contri
to
a
district
court,
it
tells
more
about
locality
than
we
do
conclude
--
make
a
conclusion
in
the
district
court
as
to
whether
these
were
substantially
equal
in
its
words.
unknown
speaker
will
you
in
light
of
finding
26
which
says
very
specifically
that
the
scientific
facilities
with
central
are
superior.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
your
argument
passed
down
to
the
claim
that
in
this
public
school
system,
central
high
school
is
the
best
and
it
excludes
girls
because
they
are
girls.
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
they
were
on
the
basis
that
was
substantial
equality.
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
asking
us
to
different
with
the
court
of
appeals
than
any
of
this
on
that
point.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
would
suggest
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
--
what
if
rule
against
you
that
they
had
thought
the
training
at
these
two
schools
were
substantially
unequal,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
would
you
are
not.
unknown
speaker
what
is
coming
around
to
my
hypothetical,
do
you
really
answering
by
inference;
the
question
which
you
said
you
did
not
want
to
answer
my
hypothetical?
was
the
same
building,
the
same
books,
the
same
teachers,
everything
is
the
same
morning
and
afternoon,
you
would
still
be
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
want
to
answer?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
not
trying
to
find
out…
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
trying
to
find
that
the
educational
opportunity
in
the
school
not
afterwards,
in
the
school
was
substantially
the
same.
is
that
the
hypothesis
you
accept?
unknown
speaker
so,
we
are
reviewing,
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
going
to
remember.
unknown
speaker
we
have
try
once
again?
unknown
speaker
and
i
promise
i
will
not
ask
you
another
question
if
you
will
answer
this
one.
are
you
standing
on
a
separate
but
equal
or
not?
unknown
speaker
are
you
standing
on
separate
by
equal,
is
that
your
point
that
schools
are
unequal.
unknown
speaker
i
respectfully
say
you
have
to
take
one
position
or
the
other.
unknown
speaker
or
at
least
alternatively.
unknown
speaker
even
if
they
are
it
is
unconstitutional
to
segregate
on
the
basis
of
sex.
unknown
speaker
no?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
your
threshold
argument
either.
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
a
threshold
argument
either.
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
that
they
are
substantially
unequal
and
only
if
it
were
found
that
they
were
substantially
equal,
would
you
prefer
to
defend
the
district
court’s
position.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
you
are
the
appellant,
you
are
the
appellant,
you
are
the
one
that
has
got
to
convince
us
both
courts
below
were
wrong
on
non-equality.
unknown
speaker
by
somebody.
unknown
speaker
contrary
to
the
views
of
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
in
consisted
with
the
views
of…
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
disturb
that,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
did
they
affirmatively
agree
with
it?
unknown
speaker
comparable
is
quite
a
different
word
from
identical.
you
can
compare
anything.
unknown
speaker
or
any
two
or
more
things.
unknown
speaker
one
has
got
women
in
it
and
one
has
got
men.
unknown
speaker
there
is
an
additional
science
teacher
at
central,
isn’t
there?
unknown
speaker
the
record
does
show
that,
doesn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
and
there
is
no
compensatory
additional
member
of
the
faculty
at
the
girls’.
unknown
speaker
and
there
is
a
finding
that
in
scientific
facilities,
at
least,
central
is
superior.
it
still
means
its
comparable,
one
is
superior
and
the
other
is
inferior
and
they
are
comparable.
unknown
speaker
very
relevant,
but
first
of
all
we
have
to
know
what
kind
of
a
case
we
have
here.
unknown
speaker
you
know
what
that
what
finding
26
indicates
and
finding
26
was
left
undisturbed
as
were
all
the
other
findings
by
the
court
of
appeals,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
unknown
speaker
let’s
go
back
these
terms.
unknown
speaker
now,
the
term
comparable
is
used
throughout
this
record.
does
that
mean
is
abused
in
the
sense
of
things,
which
are
subject
of
being
compared
or
does
it
mean
is
the
word
used
in
the
sense
that
the
intelligence
of
women
is
comparable
to
the
intelligence
of
men
that
they
are
essentially
the
same,
but
there
is
no
difference.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
it
is
comparable
better
or
less
being
separate,
but
equal?
unknown
speaker
it
is
the
same…
unknown
speaker
when
they
did
say
specifically
that
the
chemistry,
physics,
etcetera
it
was
below.
unknown
speaker
they
said
science
would
below.
unknown
speaker
they
have
said,
--
they
also
said
that
the
science
department
was
less.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
are
going
to
take
those
findings
you
got
to…
unknown
speaker
what
about
the…
unknown
speaker
i
am
interested
in
what
they
found
to
be
inferior
and
they
did
find
it
to
be
inferior.
unknown
speaker
well
that
is
inferior.
unknown
speaker
then
why
is
it
separate,
but
equal?
unknown
speaker
why
are
they
separate?
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
understand
the
option.
there
are
two
schools
that
concentrate
on
high
level
of
academic
training
higher
than
in
any
of
the
other
school
in
philadelphia,
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
what
is
all
this
noise
about
central
high
being
so
great.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
central
high
was
one
of
the
greatest
high
schools
in
the
country
that
its
reputation.
unknown
speaker
and
i
might
also
add,
i
have
never
heard
of
girls
high.
unknown
speaker
i
denied
to
the
both.
if
girls
high
is
so
great.
unknown
speaker
the
entry
requirements
for
the
two
schools
are
quite
bit
different
than
other
schools.
unknown
speaker
doesn’t
philadelphia
currently
anticipate
a
higher
grade
of
student
in
the
two
schools
and...
unknown
speaker
if
the
education
at
the
boys
school
and
the
girls
school
in
philadelphia,
these
two
schools
we
are
talking
about.
if
the
education
of
those
two
schools
is
better
generally
than
in
the
comprehensive
high
schools,
the
only
way
that
a
young
man
or
young
girl
can
get
that
brand
of
education
is
by
going
to
a
single
gender
school.
unknown
speaker
i
just
said
it
to
say,
i
did
not
put
it
as
premise
i
said
if…
unknown
speaker
if
you
want
to
call
the
premise
--
on
that
premise
the
only
way
a
person
can
get
that
level
of
education
is
by
going
to
a
school,
either
all
boys
school
or
all
girls
school.
unknown
speaker
i
take
that
the
part
of
the
argument
that
you
complied,
there
is
a
freedom
of
states
and
their
subdivision
to
experiment
in
a
educational
matters…
unknown
speaker
how
long
as
this
experiment
of
separate
races
has
been
going
on
until
about
100
years?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
an
experiment,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose,
for
example,
in
the
field
of
corrections
in
this
country,
we
have
been
in
the
business
now
for
nearly
200
years.
the
states
are
still
experimenting
and
--
there
is
a
widespread
view
that
we
haven’t
discovered
the
right
solutions
yet.
so
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
experiments
that
go
long
for
100
years
as
long
as
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gilbert,
does
the
record
tell
us
when
the
philadelphia
school
board
last
reexamined
this
question
of
whether
there
should
be
separate
schools
for
the
two?
unknown
speaker
but
does
it
tell
us
whether
the
issue
has
ever
been
presented
to
the
board
as
to
whether
or
not,
one
or
both
of
these
schools
should
be
made
coeducational.
unknown
speaker
other
than
the
fact
that
they
authorize
to
defense
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
so
then
the
record
does
not
tell
us
why
the
board
has
adapted
its
policy
does
it?
other
than
--
somebody
sue
the
board.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
i
take
that
your
task
is
conceding
that
you
must
justify
what
you
are
doing
here
to
some
extent.
let
us
assume
that
we
take
--
accept
your
position
that
two
school
are
for
all
intents
and
purposes
equal,
and
that
there
is
no
substantial
difference
between
the
two
in
terms
if
educational
opportunity.
you
say
the
case
is
automatically
over
then?
even
if
that
is
true
then
nevertheless
there
is
a
gender
based
classification
here
and
people
are
treated,
or
accept
the
schools
or
another
based
on
the
gender,
and
do
you
think
the
sate
must
justify
the
even
if
the
schools
equal
must
the
state
justify
the
classification
to
any
extent
or
do
you
say,
well,
that
is
the
end
of
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
just
asking,
must
there
be
some
justification
for
the
use
of
it,
for
the
use
of
the
gender
classification.
unknown
speaker
how
convincing
does
your
it
helped
submission
have
to
be
that
there
are
solid
educational
reasons
for
having
separate
education
for
boys
and
girls?
unknown
speaker
the
lowest
level
of
equal
protection…
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
if
there
were
five
experts
on
each
side
of
this
issue,
five
saying
there
was
a
solid
basis
for
differential
education
and
five
of
them
saying
there
is
just
no
advantage
whatsoever,
and
the
evidence
was
equally
balanced
you
should
win?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
suppose
there
were
five
one
way
and
one
on
the
other,
is
not
the
trial
of
facts
totally
free
to
accept
the
one,
and
reject
the
five
if
he
wants
to?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gilbert,
7%
of
the
students
qualified
for
admission
to
one
of
these
two
schools,
--
does
the
record
tell
us
what
percent
of
the
students
actually
go
to
these
schools?
there
is
how
many
of
those
who
qualify
elected
to
go
to
one
of
those
single
sex
schools
and
how
many
elect
to
go
a
coed
school.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn’t
correctly
show
that
both
of
these
schools
are
somewhat
under
populated.
unknown
speaker
this
has
contrasted
to
the
most
of
the
other
schools
44.30
offices.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
i
would
not
conlclude
anything
from
that
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
respectfully
submit
that
the
school
districts
position
as
presented
in
its
brief
and
indicates
to
the
questions
and
pray
that
this
court
affirms
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit,
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
can
i
ask
you
the
same
thing,
i
asked
your
adversary.
supposing,
suppose
that
we
--
contrary
to
your
submission,
we
have
concludes
that
the
two
schools
were
identical
or
equal
or
substantially
equal,
but
nevertheless
there
is
a
gender
based
classification
here,
when
we
have
to
get
to
the
question
of
separate,
but
equal,
but
do
you
think
the
city
must
justify
the
gender
based
classification
at
all
on
the
assumptions
that
these
schools
are
equal.
unknown
speaker
and
at
what
level,
there
is
such
a
thing
at
different
levels?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
city
submits
in
good
faith,
then
it
is
a
fundamental
belief
that
separate
education
gets
better
educational
results.
suppose
i
just
submit
that,
and
they
say
that’s
the
reason
for
it
and
there
are
some
basis
in
the
literature
among
the
experts,
for
that
belief,
how
close
they
must
scrutinize
exhibition.
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
stop
you
there.
could
you
validly
say
that
those
female
students
should
be
given
the
privilege
of
attending
an
all-female
school
and
yet
males
might
feel
the
same
way
and
they
should
not
be
given
the
privilege
of
attending
an
all-male
school.
how
could
you
do?
you
are
suggesting
you
could
have
co-educational
and
female,
but
you
can't
have
male
and
female?
unknown
speaker
well,
it’s
directly
responsive
to
your
point
that
that
evidence
is
not
relevant.
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
know
if
that
isn’t
the
real
reason;
they
are
psychoanalyzed
people
to
find
that
out?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
you
allow
some
good
judgment
in
the
school
board
to
say
that
this
subject
is
in
dispute
and
it
has
been
in
dispute
for
a
couple
of
hundred
years
or
at
least
a
hundred
and
we
are
going
to
try
the
general
run
of
schools,
coeducational
that
we
are
going
to
try
two
special
schools,
one
for
boys
and
one
for
girls.
unknown
speaker
anything
irrational
about
that?
unknown
speaker
that
statement
you
have
just
made
clearly
responds
to
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question
that’s
separate,
but
equal
is
unconstitutional;
the
statement
you’ve
just
made.
unknown
speaker
ms.
wallis,
i
noted
which
you
haven’t
made
here,
statutory
argument
nor
indeed
that
mr.
gilbert,
you
weigh
that
or
you
won’t
rely
on
it,
just
if
we
did
not
give
you
an
opportunity
to
or
the
time
limitations
didn’t?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
just
want
you
to
–
why
didn’t
you?
