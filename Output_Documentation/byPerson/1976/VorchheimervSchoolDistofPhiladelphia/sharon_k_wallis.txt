ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
one
particular
public
school,
the
central
high
school
philadelphia,
may
exclude
academically
qualified
female
students
solely
on
the
basis
of
their
gender.
district
court
below
applied
this
court’s
analysis
unread
and
examined
all
the
proper
justifications
for
this
policy.
after
identifying
the
school
district’s
goals
and
examining
its
justification
in
terms
of
the
particular
facts
of
this
case,
determined
that
the
policy
had
not
been
shown
to
be
fairly
and
substantially
related
to
any
of
the
respondent’s
legitimate
objectives.
this
case
presents
the
clearest
and
most
compelling
case
in
which
segregation
and
public
education
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
central
high
school
is
unique
institution
for
many
reasons.
it
was
the
first
high
school
in
philadelphia.
it
happens
also
to
be
the
second
public
high
school.
his
one
of
two
schools,
both
of
them
being
single
sex
schools
which
are
characterized
as
academic
high
schools
in
the
public
school
system.
academic
high
schools
are
defined
in
terms
of
their
exclusively
academic
curriculum
and
also
their
high
admission
standards
which
are
only
met
by
7%
of
the
students
in
the
philadelphia
school
system.
because
of
these
unique
characteristics
of
central
high
that
it’s
particularly
difficult
to
justify
the
exclusion
of
female
students
in
that
institution.
it’s
an
exclusion
that
dates
back
originally
to
a
time
when
central
was
the
only
school
in
public
school
in
philadelphia.
public
high
school
education
was
only
offered
to
exceptionally
gifted
students
and
it
was
not
offered
to
female
students
because
it
was
not
regarded
as
appropriate
to
their
abilities
and
their
needs.
that’s
what
this
court
has
referred
to
as
old
notions
about
the
role
of
women
and
men
in
society.
subsequently,
philadelphia
high
school
for
girls
was
developed
as
an
all
female
school
which
has
the
same
admission
standards
but
it
does
not
have
the
history
or
the
character
of
central
high
school.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
well,
central
has
a
very
unique
history
not
only
because
it
was
the
first
high
school
in
philadelphia
but
because
it
always
held
a
certain
position
in
the
school
system
as
the
training
ground
for
leaders.
if
you
are
interested,
you
might
want
to
look
at
(inaudible)
republic
which
goes
in
some
great
detail
of
the
history
of
central
high
school.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
its
reputation,
its
standing
in
the
community
and
i
think
above
all,
its
mission
that
is
that
it
was
always
held
to
be
and
it
was
created
to
be
a
special
school
for
training
leaders
within
the
public
school
system.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
no.
well,
the
stated
objective,
which
is
repeated
again
and
again,
as
you
have
seen
in
the
cornad
book,
some
excerpts
of
that
are
quoted
not
only
in
our
brief
but
also
in
the
brief
of
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae.
the
goal
of
the
school,
the
concept
of
the
school
was
“to
train
leaders
in
industry
and
unlike”
to
train
leaders
in
all
fields
of
endeavor.
that
was
an
education
that
was
only
open
to
male
students.
the
definition
of
the
school
was
one
of
preparing
people
for
leadership
and
i
think
we
are
relying
obviously
on
sweatt
v.
painter.
i
am
taking
that
a
step
further
in
a
sense,
what
i
am
saying
is
the
school
not
only
has
all
of
the
characteristics
that
made
for
greatness
in
an
educational
institution
that
is
outstanding
alumni,
a
great
tradition
of
accomplishment
as
well
as
particular
high
reputation
national
reputation.
but
in
addition
to
that
this
is
the
result
of
a
conscious
effort
to
maintain
such
an
institution
within
the
philadelphia
school
system
and
that
institution
has
traditionally
been
exclusively
open
to
male
students.
the
trial
court
here
did
find
that
the
education
available
at
philadelphia
high
school
for
girls
was
substantially
equivalent
to
that
available
central,
but
if
you
look
at
that
finding
authority
and
the
surrounding
findings,
it
become
very
clear
that
the
trial
court
defined
education
as
level
of
classroom
instruction
and
the
trial
court
mentions,
for
example,
central
is
the
only
high
school
in
philadelphia
with
the
substantial
private
endowment
that’s
the
barnwell
foundation.
the
barnwell
foundation
was
responsible
for
bringing
to
the
schools
such
distinguished
speakers
and
this
is
just
recently
as
robert
kennedy
when
he
was
attorney
general.
hubert
humphrey
when
he
was
vice
president.
more
recently
it
does
not
happen
to
be
mentioned
in
the
courts
opinion,
elliott
richardson.
this
is
not
something
in
the
very
text.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
i
think
that
we
have
to
define
the
terms.
i
understand
the
trial…
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
that
is
not
the
term
i
am
concerned
about,
it
is
training.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
yeah,
the
question
is
what
do
you
mean
by
training
or
what
do
you
mean
by
education?
what
i
mean
by
education
and
what
i
believe
this
court...
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
what
i
am
arguing
is
that
there
is
an
important
opportunity
that
is
lost
by
being
deprived
of
access
to
central
high
school.
that
opportunity
is
the
opportunity
for
a
unique
preparation
for
a
leadership
role
in
society.
it
is
not
a
difference
in
classroom
instruction
particularly,
although
there
are
some
differences
in
the
schools.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
well
then
i
think
you
would
have
a
fairly
clear
statutory
problem.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
there
would
be
a
stronger
statutory
argument,
under
title
20,
if
you
were
talking
about
the
same
school
with
segregated
classes.
i
will
put
that
aside
for
the
moment,
that’s
not
what
you
were
asking
me
about
obviously.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
i
think
that
that
would
be
certainly
a
different
case
from
this
one.
there
are
many
qualities,
many
aspects
of
central
high
school
that
we
are
concerned
about
here.
if
the
diploma
were
the
same
then
that
would
be
one
opportunity
the
girls
were
not
denied.
if
by
graduating
from
this
institution
in
a
separate
program
they
were
entitled
to
be
full-fledged
members
of
the
central
high
school
alumni
society
with
which
the
district
court
recognized
was
an
extremely
influential
and
important
organization
within
philadelphia.
that
would
be
another
opportunity
that
we
would
not
be
denied
to
female
students
under
your
hypothesis
which
is
now.
there
is
another
aspect
of
this
case
and
that
is
the
opportunity
for
young
men
and
young
women
to
enjoy
a
free
exchange
of
ideas
which
the
court
talks
about
in
sweatt
v.
painter
and
also
in
its
companion
case,mclaurin
v.
oklahoma.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
no,
your
honor.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
the
case
is
all
about
all
of
those
things
but...
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
your
honor,
that
is
--
it
is
the
easier
case.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
it
is
the
easier
case.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
this
is
the
easiest
possible
case.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
and
the
reason
it
is
the
easiest
possible
case
is
because
central
does
have
all
of
these
unique
features
and
also
because
when
you
are
talking
about
young
women,
who
are
academically
gifted,
you
are
talking
about
the
young
women,
who
are
most
qualified
for
leadership
positions,
both
young
women
and
young
men.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
you
are
right
the
district
court...
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
now
the
district
court…
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
oh
no!
there
is
a
confusion
in
the
district
court
in
footnote
one
you
will
see.
the
district
court
unfortunately
didn’t
quite
understand
sweatt
v.
painter
but
the
district
court
made
all
of
the
necessary
findings.
so,
now
i
am
asking
you…
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
yes,
the
district
court
found
that
the
level
of
classroom
education
was
significantly
similar
which
this
court
assumed
in
sweatt
v.
painter.
the
district
court
went
on
to
find
very
significant
differences
between
the
two
schools.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
oh
no!
it’s
not
a
question
of
whether
they
are
equal
or
not.
for
purposes
of
this
record,
we
have
to
go
on
the
hypothesis
that
the
level
of
classroom
instruction
is
the
same,
but…
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
i
think
the
court
also
found
that
the
level
was
generally
the
same
which
is
what
i
am
saying.
now
there
are
differences.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
that
is
my
argument.
now
i
am
trying
to
tell
justice
white,
why
you
can
accept
my
argument
and
you
don’t
have
to
overrule
the
district
court
and
the
reason
is
that
the
district
court
found
that
there
were
very
significant
differences
between
the
schools.
the
central
was,
in
fact,
superior
in
terms
of
the
accomplishments
of
its
alumni.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
they
didn’t
overturn
any
of
those
of
findings.
the
court
appeals
really…
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
i
don’t
know
where
they
got
that.
they
do.
no,
i
am
mean
seriously…
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
no,
because
they
did
not
change,
they
did
not
overrule
any
of
the
facts
in
the
records.
they
just
say
in
a
conclusory
sense
that
the…
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
well,
your
honor,
this
is…
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
yes,
i
think
they
would
have
because
i
think
the
question
here
is
not
the
facts.
the
question
here
is
the
law.
the
problem
in
the
district
--
we
won
in
the
district
court,
let’s
get
back
straight
first.
the
district
court’s
analysis,
which
i
think
is
a
very
good
one,
was
this
is
obviously
classification
based
on
sex,
gender.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
i
did
not
mean
to
say
that
i
did
not
want
to
answer.
what
i
was…
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
what
i
am
trying
to
say
that
this
is
the
easiest
case.
all
of
those
factors
you
have
excluded
in
your
hypothesis
make
this
an
easier
case
than
hypothesis
but…
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
but
even
under
your…
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
the
hypothesis
that
i
would
--
what
i
take
from
the
record
is
that
the
district
court
found
that
the
education
offered
the
classes
were
not
significantly
different,
but
that…
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
well,
yes
that
you
are
still
reviewing
it
from
the
factual
record
which
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
disturb.
they
did
not
find
that
any
of
factual
findings
ran
against
the
way
to
the
evidence
and
if
it
is
these
are
still
the
facts.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
and?
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
for
same
schools
are
not
equal.
in
addition
to
that…
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
i
don’t
think
that
i
have
to
argue
that
separate
but
equal
is
the
law
in
order
to
argue
the
schools
are
not
equal;
i
am
saying
the
schools
are
not
equal.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
i
think
alternatively
that
the
schools
number
one,
are
not
equal
and
number
two…
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
no.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
that
even
if
not,
a
slightly
narrower
position
which
is
even
if
they
were
equal
which
i
think
the
purposes
of
legal
analysis
was
with
district
court’s
position
that
the
school
district
fail
to
demonstrate
why
female
should
be
excluded
from
central
high.
that
is
not
to
say
that
sex
segregation
is
inherently
unequal
and
therefore
unconstitutional.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
this
court
decided
reid(ph),
this
court
decided
craig,
you
decided
the
intervening
cases.
you
decided
in
those
cases
that
classification
based
on
gender
must
be
justified
and
you
indicated
what
type
of
justification
must
be
met
and
most
recently
in
craig
you
said
it
has
to
be
substantially
related
to
an
important
governmental
purpose.
you
also
said
there
that
that
was
but
you
would
said
in
reid.
the
trial
court
here
happened
to
apply
the
language
in
reid
because
he
did
not
have
benefited
craig
but
i
don’t
think
there
is
any
substantial
difference
there.
trial
court
said
this
is
a
sex
classification
case,
school
district
justified.
school
district
presented
certain
proper
justification.
the
trial
court
examined
those
and
said
that
they
fail
to
meet
the
standard.
the
supreme
court
of
united
state
just
told
me
in
reid
i
must
apply
and
therefore
i
find
that
the
exclusion
of
female
students
from
central
high
school
is
unconstitutional.
now
that
is
not
nearly
as
broad
as
saying
the
exclusion
of
female
students
from
any
school
in
the
entire
country...
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
what?
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
i
believe….
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
well,
i
think
that
the
respondents
have
to
meet
both
of
those
in
order
to
prevail.
they
must
convince
you
that
the
schools
are
equal
under
the
standards
set
forth
in
sweatt
v.
painter
which
applies…
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
you
are
right.
alright,
you
have
to
be
convinced.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
by
somebody
that
the
schools
are
in
fact
equal…
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
no.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
the
district
court
found
that
the
schools
were
equal
only
in
one
respect.
in
sweatt
v.
painter,
the
court
hypothesized
that
the
jim
crow
law
school
and
the
university
of
texas
would
be
equal
in
that
particular
way
and
found
that
all
of
these
other
characteristic
what
they
called
intangibles
were
terribly
important
in
determining
whether
equal
protection
standard
was
met.
we
have
all
those
findings.
i
am
not
asking
you
to
overrule
the
findings
of
the
district
court;
i
am
just
asking
you
to
apply
sweatt
to
this
case.
if
you
look
at
footnote
1,
the
district
court
confused
brown
and
sweatt
and
said
in
order
to
apply
sweatt,
you
had
to
show
feeling
and
inferiority.
that
is
just
wrong
under
law.
that
is
why
the
district
court
did
not
make
use
of
the
findings,
but
the
findings
are
there.
we
are
not
asking
you
to
make
any
new
findings
that
are
not
in
the
record.
now,
that
and
in
addition
to
that
the
court
and
both,
sweatt
and
mclaughlin
was
concerned,
i
believe,
with
individuals
who
were
destined
for
leadership
positions
in
the
community
and
according
to
both
of
those
cases
says
that
the
free
exchange
of
ideas
with
members
of
the
dominant
society
is
a
very
important
interest
in
addition
to
the
intangibles
like
prestige
of
the
faculty
and
prestige
of
graduates,
etcetera,
etcetera
that
just
the
opportunity
to
the
free
exchange
of
ideas
is
essentially
important
to
those
individuals
who
are
going
to
take
on
leadership
positions
in
the
community.
to
that
extent,
i
am
arguing
that
segregated
education
is
hardest
to
sustain
when
you
are
talking
about
the
most
talented
young
women
in
the
public
school
community
because
the
net
context
you
are
talking
about
girls
who
are
going
to
be
lawyers
and
doctors
and
judges
and
all
of
those
things.
and
it
is
most
important
for
them
just
as
it
is
important
for
them
to
graduate
from
a
school
where
that
they
will
have
an
entree
to
alumni
who
are
in
leadership
positions
in
those
fields
of
endeavor.
it
is
important
for
them
to
go
to
school
with
the
boys
who
are
likewise
going
to
be
leaders
in
all
of
those
fields
of
endeavor
perhaps
in
greater
numbers
for
sometime
to
come.
cutting
of
those
contexts
does
a
great
disservice
to
these
particular
women.
now,
with
the
court’s
permission
i
would
like
to
reserve
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.

thank
you.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
yes
i
do
your
honor.
one
thing
i
would
like
to
attract
the
court’s
attention
at
some
point
to
the
exhibit
a
in
our
reply
brief,
which
exerts
all
the
high-school
related
information
from
one
of
the
p-12.
i
think
you
will
find
it
gives
you
some
overview
and
some
information
that
will
be
helpful
in
considering
this
case.
now,
very
briefly,
the
district
court
reviewed
every
single
one
of
the
justifications
that
was
proffered
here
and
found
that
they
were
without
mark,
with
respect
to
this
particular
case,
and
testimony
was
presented
of
two
sorts,
one
of
them,
dr.
jones’
study
indicated
at
best
that
some
male
students
may
to
some
slight
extent
benefit
from
single
sex
education,
that
was
based
on
study.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
i
think
they
must
justify.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
well,
i
think
that
what
this
court
has
said
really
is
that
you
must
scrutinize
the
justification.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
they
purported
to
prove
and
it
does
seem
to
be
some
of
evidence
to
this
extent
that
some
female
students
benefit
from
single-sex
education
because
they
are
afraid
to
express
themselves
in
presence
of
boys
of
whatever
it
may
be.
let’s
assume
for
the
present
purposes
that
that
evidence
is
valid.
you
cannot
use
that
argument
to
sustain
the
continued
existence
of
central
as
an
all-male
institution
because
what
you
are
doing
is
excluding
female
students
who
may
not
belong
in
that
category
like
susan
vorchheimer
who
obviously
is
able
to
excel
and….
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
you
have
to
examine
it.
and
you
have
to
examine
it
first
to
say,
is
it
really
relevant
to
their
goal?
now,
and
that
is
what
the
district
court
did.
if
it
is
true
that
some
female
students
benefit
from
single-sex
education;
that
is
a
reason
for
having
a
school
for
female
students.
it
is
not
a
reason
for
refusing
to
admit
female
students
to
a
central
high
school,
if
they
are
in
fact,
female
students
who
would
benefit
from
central.
so,
you
have
to
examine
that.
number
two,
they
say
there
is
expert
--
there
are
education.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
well,
that
is
another
point
that
i
am
getting
to.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
the
question
is
in
what
way
would
suppose
we
are
successful
in
this
lawsuit
and
female
students
are
admitted
to
central
high
school.
why
would
a
male
student
want
to
go
girls’
high,
since
he
already
has
a
coed
academic
school
that
he
can
go
to,
that
central
high
school?
now,
the
next
issue
is,
well,
should
he
be
able
to
go
to
a
single-sex
school?
he
could
also
go
to
a
single-sex
school
because
the
school
district
still
has
thomas
edison,
which
is
a
single-sex
comprehensive
school.
so,
he
can
go
to
an
all-boy
school
too,
which
is
the
reason
that
they
are
preferred
justification
and
the
district
court
said
they
say
it
is
freedom
of
choice.
it
can
not
be
freedom
of
choice,
that
can
not
be
the
real
reason
because
they
do
not
offer
choice
to
students
who
are
interested
in
academic
education
and
besides
that…
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
no,
i
think
they
have
to
address
to
a
good
judgment
to
it
and
in
this….
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
no.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
i
am
not
suggesting
in
this
argument
that
they
could
not
do
that.
they
have
two
comprehensive
schools,
edison
and
kensington.
they
may
maintain
those
schools
under,
what
we
are
asking
for
a
year,
as
single-sex
schools,
as
options
for
those
students
who
would
choose
single-sex
education.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
you
can
not
take,
number
one,
the
best
school
of
a
system
and
number
two,
you
can
not
take
the
only
academic
schools
and
make
them
entirely
single-sex.
that
is
the
problem
here
that
students
who
choose
academic
schools
are
not
given
a
choice
and
that
is
why
you
can
not
say
this
is
in
order
to
provide
freedom
of
choice;
that
is
what
the
district
court
said
because
you
are
only
providing
freedom
of
choice
to
the
people
who
choose
a
single-sex
academic
high
school
and
you
do
not
have
any
idea
who
would
choose
a
coed
academic
high
school
because
you
do
not
offer
that
alternative.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
in
this
case,
this
is
what
i
have
to
say,
but
i
have
not
said
and
i
do
not
think
i
have
to
say
in
this
case
that
it
would
not
be
permissible
for
the
school
district
to
maintain
single-sex
schools
and
they
do,
have
two
others
as
well
as
a
female
school.
if
they
could
justify
those
and
the
only
way
to
justify
them
on
the
theory
that
they
are
based
on
freedom
of
choice
is
to
show
that
a
full
range
of
choices
are
generally
available,
which
is
not
the
case
here.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
if
you
want
me
to
respond
to
that.
ms.
sharon
k.
wallis
the
reason
i
did
not
was
--
there
are
two
reasons;
one,
i
think
that
the
constitutional
argument
is
much
narrow.
if
you
decide
the
case
on
the
statute
and
the
only
way
that
will
avoid
the
constitutional
argument,
then
you
must
decide
that
all
schools
must
be
coeducational
because
that
is
what
the
statue
would
say
and
i
do
not
believe
that
-–
that’s
broader
than
the
relief
that
we
are
asking
for
in
this
case
and
therefore
i
would
not
urge
it
on
this
court
and
i
think
there
is
a
section
5
problem,
which
is
raised
by
the
united
states,
which
i
think
is
much
more
difficult
again
than
the
constitutional
problem
here,
so
i
think
it
only
creates
difficulties.
it
is
better
to
decide
it
on
the
narrower
constitutional
grounds.
