unknown
speaker
do
i
understand
that
you
are
saying,
the
finding
that
there
was
a
lack
of
racial
balance
that
is
the
schools
if
not
each
reflect
the
total
composition
of
the
community
is
an
erroneous
finding.
you
are
attacking
that
finding
are
you?
unknown
speaker
you
are
attacking
the
conclusion
that
close
from
was
from
that
finding,
namely
the
constitutional
violation?
unknown
speaker
you
meant
three
of
your
reasons,
did
you
get
to
your
report?
unknown
speaker
mr.
greer,
you
told
us
at
the
outset
the
three
facts
on
which
the
district
court
found
a
cumulative
constitutional
violation.
first,
the
fact
that
the
schools
were
racially
imbalanced,
the
individual
schools,
two,
the
rescission
of
the
resolution
and
three,
the
optional
zones.
and
you
submitted
to
us
that
the
first
and
the
second
were
not
in
themselves
constitutional
violations.
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
sixth
circuit
say
about
the
first
and
the
second?
unknown
speaker
how
can
it
be
cumulative
if
there
is
only
one?
unknown
speaker
and
you
concede,
you
tell
me
if
i
am
mistaken
in
my
understanding.
i
understood
you
concede
that
the
optional
zones
at
least
some
of
them,
with
respect
to
some
of
the
schools,
some
of
high
schools
could
validly
be
found
then
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
of
fourteenth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
so
you
do
not
concede
that
the
optional
zones
which
concededly
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
resulted
in
this
racial
imbalance.
unknown
speaker
well
that
would
affect
at
the
most
in
your
submission
the
racial
makeup
of
the
student
body
in
no
more
than
two
high
schools.
unknown
speaker
three
high
schools.
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
dunbar
in
there
somewhere
in
there?
unknown
speaker
when
did
that
practice
cease?
unknown
speaker
how
many
high
schools
are
there
in
the
dayton
school
district?
unknown
speaker
does
that
go
outside
of
montgomery
county
at
all
or
is
it
well
within
montgomery
county?
unknown
speaker
so
how
about
the
school
district?
unknown
speaker
and
there
is
250,000
population
figure
you
gave
us
was
what
for
the
school
population
or
the
total
population
of
the
school
district
or
the
population
of
the
city?
unknown
speaker
from
all
ages
and
sexes?
unknown
speaker
the
district
court
find
to
the
contrary?
i
found
that
there
was
not
a
dual
system
i
thought,
as
a
fact.
unknown
speaker
well,
did
not
the
district
court
find
that
there
was
not
a
dual
system?
unknown
speaker
is
not
broader
than
that?
unknown
speaker
it
did
not,
they
really
find
that
the
dual
system
had
been
dismantled?
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
speaking
as
of
1954.
unknown
speaker
so
your
response
to
mr.
justice
powell
is
1954.
unknown
speaker
can
you
give
us
some
focus
us
to
time
and
also
as
to
when
these
particular
events
took
place?
unknown
speaker
do
you
speak
of
1954
or
1975?
unknown
speaker
how
many
courts
have
intervened
since
then,
that
is
in
this
case.
you
have
had
three
district
court
opinions,
had
there
been?
unknown
speaker
was
that
true
at
the
time
this
lawsuit
was
brought?
unknown
speaker
this
suit
was
brought
when,
1971?
unknown
speaker
and
at
that
time
--
just
want
to
be
sure,
are
you
telling
us
that
at
that
time
this
suit
was
initiated,
dayton
was
operating
in
a
dual
school
system
in
terms
of
racial
segregation?
unknown
speaker
the
district
court
found
that
it
was
not,
did
not
it?
unknown
speaker
well
was
it,
are
you
telling
us
that
1971,
at
the
time
this
litigation
was
commenced
that
the
black
teachers
were
not
allowed
to
teach
white
children?
unknown
speaker
here
is,
as
we
have
been
told
as
i
understood
it
in
reading
the
briefs
that
there
were
three
facts
found
as
accumulated
constitutional
violations.
one,
racial
imbalance
in
the
schools
as
de
facto;
two,
the
rescission
of
a
resolution
by
the
school
board,
and
three,
certain
optional
attendance
zones
and
in
some
of
the
high
schools.
but
those
were
the
three,
you
are
telling
us,
do
i
misunderstand
it
that
there
were
really
in
fact
many,
many
more.
unknown
speaker
but
they
were
racially
identifiable
schools
in
terms
of
some
of
them
being
maybe
all
black
or
predominantly
black
and
others
all
white
or
predominantly
white,
that
is
not
argued
about,
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
no,
were
talking
about
this
litigation.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
us
just
confine
ourselves
to
this
lawsuit.
lots
of
things
went
on
and
--
unknown
speaker
but
the
district
court
did
find
and
yet
justice
stewart
has
asked
you
this
twice
and
i
still
do
not
have
your
answer
to
it.
the
district
court
did
find
that
dayton
did
not
have
a
dual
system,
did
it
not?
you
are
perfectly
free
to
qualify
your
answer
or
respond
anyway
but
surely
you
can
give
a
yes
or
no
answer.
unknown
speaker
what
i
understood
you
to
say
before,
what
was
meant
was
a
statutorily
required
dual
system?
i
thought
what
i
said
was
no
dual
system,
that
is
what
they
were
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
you
meant?
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
in
fact
a
dual
you
were
saying.
unknown
speaker
you
said
it
was
dual
school
system
but
it
was
not
required
by
any
statute
or
any
law
of
ohio.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
no
law
since
have
ever,
but
certainly
not
since
before
the
civil
war.
unknown
speaker
and
when
was
this?
unknown
speaker
are
not
we
really
concern
about
what
the
facts
were
in
1971,
when
this
lawsuit
was
brought?
unknown
speaker
well,
least
of
this
as
a
product
of
his
heritage
and
of
his
environment
whether
it
would
be
a
human
being
or
a
societal
entity,
but
we
are
concerned
here
with
what
the
facts
were
in
1971
when
this
litigation
was
initiated,
are
we
not?
unknown
speaker
does
not
your
black
and
white
school
argument
depend
on
an
underlying
finding
that
there
was
a
dual
school
system?
unknown
speaker
was
there
anything
unconstitutional
as
such
i
would
say
in
1926
about
the
school
board’s
segregating
on
the
basis
of
race?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
law
is
requiring
attendance
of
only
one
race
to
school
would
certainly
be
struck
down
by
brown.
unknown
speaker
but
you
said
then
the
act
in
1929
was
illegal
and
the
school
board
in
fact
should
have
foreseen
that
25
years
later,
brown
would
have
overruled
plessy.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
the
government’s
brief?
unknown
speaker
so
are
you
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
do
you
agree
with
it
or
do
not
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
will
put
it
this
way,
do
you
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
as
much
the
government
does?
unknown
speaker
when
you
do
not
agree
with
the
government?
unknown
speaker
for
you
to
win
here,
do
you
have
to
convince
us
that
the
court
of
appeals
misunderstood
the
facts?
unknown
speaker
you
are
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
to
some
extent?
you
think
they
apply
the
wrong
legal
standard?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
articulate
the
right
legal
standard
or
view
the
facts
in
the
light
of
the
right
legal
standard.
if
we
agreed
with
you,
would
not
it
normally
we
say
what
the
right
legal
standard
is
and
remand?
unknown
speaker
would
not
we
normally
do
that?
unknown
speaker
you
say
they
did
apply
the
right
legal
standard
but
they
did
not
spell
out
how
they
did
it.
unknown
speaker
and
they
did
not
understand
the
facts
very
well,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lucas,
is
this
decree
of
the
district
court
--
who
was
it,
judge
rubin?
unknown
speaker
provided
that
they
are
not
being
more
than
115%
deviation
in
any
school.
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
is
but
basically
it
was
a
15%
plus
or
minus
in
any
school.
unknown
speaker
and
as
of
a
particular
precise
date
or
time,
there
was
no
continuing.
unknown
speaker
the
decree
did
not
provide
or
envision
periodic
review
to
maintain
this
sort
of
school
population.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
racial
balance
15%
plus
or
minus
is
compatible
with
the
standards
laid
down
in
swann
and
reasserted
in
the
first
milliken
v.
bradley
case?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
racial
balance,
15%
plus
or
minus,
that
does
not
sound
like
the
starting
point
that
was
dealt
within
swann.
that
sounds
like
the
targets,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
now,
let
us
go
back
to
swann
a
minute
and
swann
as
i
recall
the
figures
at
least
71:29
and
at
the
earliest
stages
of
the
litigation,
this
was
identified
as
the
problem.
in
the
swann,
opinion
the
court
said
that
if
we
thought
he
had
said
there
is
a
target
to
achieve
71:29
that
being
the
ratio
or
the
population
of
the
entire
school
system,
we
would
reverse
if
there
is
no
constitutional
requirements
to
do
that.
now
is
that
relieved
when
you
say
71:29
that
you
can
deviate
15%?
unknown
speaker
the
optional
zones
have
sometimes
been
referred
to
as
a
freedom
of
choice
policy.
in
the
early
years
after
brown
as
i
recall
that
policy
was
thought
to
be
compatible
with
the
constitution.
do
you
recall
when
the
court
of
appeals
held
for
the
first
time
that
the
policy
was
not
valid
and
if
you
do,
can
you
relate
that
to
the
creation
of
the
optional
zones
involved
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
i
wish
that
i
could
and
specifically
i
cannot,
it
has
been
a
factor
that
has
been
involved
in
a
number
of
cases
the
detroit
case
comes
to
mind
although
it
was
merely
one.
there
were
much
more
serious
situations
found
there.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
i
thought
the
green
was
placed.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
right
--
i
think
you
are
correct.
unknown
speaker
i
think
green
was
the
first
case
of
this
court
but
my
question
was
directed
to
the
total
field’s
level.
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
whether
any
of
these
optional
zones
were
created
after
green
was
handed
down
in
1968?
unknown
speaker
where
are
you
now
77,
and
78?
unknown
speaker
mr.
greer,
the
district
court’s
decree
has
been
effectuated
and
is
now
operative,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
there
was
no
stay
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
and
what
was
the
date
of
the
decree?
unknown
speaker
so
this
is
the
first
school
year
which
has
been
effectuated.
unknown
speaker
oh
certainly
not
a
reason
for
you
to
lose
your
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
geer,
precisely
what
relief
do
you
ask?
