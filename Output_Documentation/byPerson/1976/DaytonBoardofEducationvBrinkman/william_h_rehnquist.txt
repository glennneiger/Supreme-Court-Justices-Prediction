where
you
served
with
the
copy
of
the
motion
for
leave
to
file
a
brief
amicus?
justice

it
is
late

know.
justice

so
you
do

justice

this
school
desegregation
case
was
initially
filed
in
1972
by
parents
of
black
children
attending
schools
operating
--
operated
by
the
dayton,
ohio
board
of
education.
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
ohio
found
that
there
was
substantial
racial
imbalance
among
the
schools
of
the
district.
and
that
in
at
least
two
instances,
the
board
continued
to
employ
optional
attendance
zones
having
a
tendency
to
aggravate
the
racial
imbalance
and
that
the
board
had
rescinded
resolutions
of
a
predecessor
board
which
it
acknowledge
responsibility
for
the
racially
imbalance
condition
of
the
schools
stating
that
these
three
facts
are
cumulatively
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
district
court
concluded
that
a
remedial
desegregation
plan
was
constitutionally
required.
on
three
separate
occasions,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
reviewed
remedial
plans
promulgated
by
the
district
court.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
lower
court's
findings
of
fact
but
on
the
first
two
occasions,
reversed
the
district
court
plans.
the
third
plan
adopted
by
the
district
court
employed
system
wide
transportation
of
pupils
as
a
means
of
achieving
racial
balance
and
that
plan
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
vacate
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
facts
found
below
that
constitute
an
equal
protection
violation
are
a
very
limited
significance
and
do
not
support
the
broad
system
wide
remedy
finally
adopted
by
the
district
court
only
after
it's
repeated
reversals
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
plan
finally
approved
by
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
comply
with
well-established
principles
of
our
cases
that
the
remedy
must
be
tailored
to
the
constitutional
violations
found.
only
if
there
is
a
system
wide
violation
is
a
system
wide
remedy
warranted.
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
further
findings
of
fact
and
for
promulgation
of
a
plan
tailored
to
remedying
any
constitutional
violations
found.

justice
stevens

a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
