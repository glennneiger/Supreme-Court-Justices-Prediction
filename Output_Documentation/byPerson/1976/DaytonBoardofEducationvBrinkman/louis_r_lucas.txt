mr.
louis
r.
lucas
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
answering
first
the
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
believe
the
population
at
least
the
biggest
we
had
in
our
brief
is
250,000.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
i
believe
the
city’s
attorney
within
montgomery
county,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
school
district
does
go
beyond
the
limits
of
the
city,
but
not
beyond
the
limits
of
the
county.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
that
is
the
city
of
dayton.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
that
is
correct,
the
pupil
population
is
45,000
people,
slightly
less
than
15%
of
them
were
black.
our
argument
to
this
court
is
really
in
two
basic
parts.
there
was
in
dayton,
ohio
in
1954,
had
the
jury
segregated
system,
a
dual
system
and
that
pre-round
dual
system
was
never
dismantled
until
the
district
court
finally
ordered
a
system
wide
plan
of
non
degradation.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
well,
i
think
that
the
district
courts,
definition
of
dual
is
probably
relevant
and
its
definition
is
as
suggested
by
the
defendants
and
we
have
referred
to
it
in
our
brief
what
they
suggested
was
in
order
to
have
a
dual
system,
it
had
to
be
required
by
state
law.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
i
think
in
that
context,
yes
he
did
your
honor
and
i
referred
--
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
yes
sir,
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
your
honor,
i
think
you
have
to
distinguish
here
between
the
facts
that
we
are
in
dispute
and
called
for
the
district
court
to
resolve
and
the
facts
which
were
not
disputed
and
which
during
this
lengthy
trial,
that
has
been
referred
to,
were
not
contested
in
anyway.
there
was
no
evidence
offered
to
the
contrary
and
if
i
may
just
quickly
summarize
--
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not.
in
dayton
in
1954,
you
had
five
schools
to
100%
black.
there
was
the
garfield
school,
which
we
detailed,
its
establishment
and
which
was
not
controverted
at
the
trial.
garfield
started
out
with
the
black,
white
students
in
a
backroom
and
then
in
an
annex
in
back
when
the
black
population
grew,
the
garfield
school
was
converted.
whites
were
signed
out
and
the
faculty
was
flip-flopped
in
classic
style
so
that
it
was
all
black.
during
that
period
of
time,
while
there
were
black
students
in
separate
rooms
in
the
garfield
school
are
in
the
annex
and
black
teachers
were
not
permitted
to
teach
white
children.
that
was
the
expressed
stated
policy
which
was
a
change
from
the
previous
policy
to
dayton
board,
which
was
not
to
hire
blacks.
that
too,
is
not
in
dispute.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
that
school
was
established
in
1912,
i
believe
and
it
continued
forward
your
honor.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
as
of
1954,
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
it
was
a
100%
black,
but
it
is
our
--
go
forward.
the
will
school
is
again
another
school
where
the
black
population
increased,
where
black
teachers
were
not
permitted
to
teach
white
children
and
when
a
sufficient
number
of
black
students
was
in
that
school
so
that
it
became
crowded
in
terms
of
black.
enrolment
the
white
students
were
signed
out.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
garfield
and
--
well
they
are
in
the
brief
your
honor,
i
am
sorry
i
do
not
have
the
hand
along
that.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
i
am
saying
these
schools
existed
in
1954,
but
how
they
got
to
be
black
schools
is
detailed
in
the
record
and
not
controverted.
there
was
no
testimony
that
the
flip-flopped
of
faculty
did
not
take
place.
there
was
no
testimony
that
the
black
annex
out
in
back
did
not
exist
and
the
testimony
by
live
witnesses
who
were
in
those
schools
when
ms.
lewis
troy
testified
she
had
been
in
the
system
as
a
teacher
for
40
years
and
never
permitted
to
teach
a
white
child.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
well,
include
all
the
orders;
i
suppose
four
or
five
orders
that
are
in
the
record.
there
are
two
really
opinions
and
the
third
ruling
on
remedy
after
the
second
remand
from
the
court
of
appeals.
what
i
am
saying
to
the
court
is
that
these
matters
were
not
in
dispute.
his
counsel
states
at
the
time
of
brown,
there
were
the
black
schools.
now
in
wagaman,
this
school
in
1945
was
built
in
conjunction
with
the
desoto
bass
housing
project
which
was
a
black
housing
project.
the
dunbar
school
which
has
been
discussed
was
in
existence
as
a
high
school
through
1962.
now
it
served
more
than
the
traditional
high
school
grades,
various
times
it
served
grade
7
through
12.
that
school
had
a
black
faculty
assigned
to
it
and
now
the
dayton’s
rule,
black
teachers
could
not
teach
white
children,
so
it
was
a
citywide
dual
overlapping
and
again
that
was
not
contested
and
it
set
forth
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
that
was
true
at
the
time
of
the
lawsuit
was
brought
with
respect
to
a
new
school
in
dunbar,
that
the
old
dunbar
school
was
closed
in
1962
changed
its
name
and
became
mcfarland
and
at
that
time,
two
of
the
previous
black
elementary
schools
in
that
area
were
closed
and
those
two
schools
were
closed.
they
were
assigned
to
the
mcfarland,
which
was
the
old
dunbar
high
school,
a
new
dunbar
--
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
yes,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
that
is
clearly
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
i
think
the
district
court
used
the
term
dual
in
terms
of
mandate
and
segregation
you
have
to
consider
the
position
taken
by
the
defendants
and
i
think
the
understanding
of
the
district
court
of
that
word
dualism.
the
defendants
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
first
appeal
that
the
brown
one
duty
applied
only
to
those
school
districts
where
a
dual
system
was
compelled
or
authorized
by
statute
and
has
the
lack
of
ability
where
a
statutory
dual
system
has
never
existed.
that
was
the
context
that
the
district
court
was
talking
about
dualism.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
no,
your
honor,
that
was
changed
as
a
result
of
action
taken
by
hew
where
it
vies
the
district
that
they
had
racially
motivated
assignment
of
teachers
and
staff;
and
an
agreement
was
ultimately
worked
out
and
resulted
in
reassignment
of
faculty.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
i
like
there
were
many
more
facts
found
and
i
think
some
of
those
facts
go
to
make
up
the
pattern
of
racially
identifiable
schools
that
the
district
court
noted
and
--
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
well,
it
is
our
position
i
think
the
records
are
undisputed
that
those
schools
as
of
1954
--
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
at
the
time
of
trial.
your
honor,
i
think
both
in
1954
and
we
had
a
trial.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
i
think
this
lawsuit
at
the
time
of
trial
we
had
unremedied
pre
1954
violations
and
a
dual
system
which
both
the
duty
on
the
school
board
from
that
point
forward
to
disestablished
the
segregation
that
was
expound
at
that
time,
we
have
continuing
--
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
yes,
your
honor,
the
district
court
did
use
those
words
and
i
think
that
that
was
it
meant
as
i
have
already
explained
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
did
not
mean
to
--
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
that
is
exactly
what
i
mean
and
i
think
that
is
exactly
what
the
district
court
was
talking
about,
since
that
was
the
dispute.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
that
is
precisely.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
then
our
position
and
that
is
why
we
did
not
understand
the
argument
was
constantly
presented
by
the
defendants
that
brown
standards
did
not
apply
and
could
not
refer
to
any
of
the
brown
cases
in
analyzing
the
facts
in
dayton
and
applying
the
legal
standard
to
those
facts
because
there
was
no
statutory
dual
system.
we
do
not
see
that
that
is
the
law
or
correct
application
of
it.
if
i
may,
the
1954
in
addition
to
dunbar
as
a
citywide
school,
you
have
the
miami
chapel
school,
which
was
established
in
1953.
it
is
undisputed
in
this
record
that
1953,
the
miami
chapel
school
was
an
all
black
school.
so
that
you
have
a
discreet
un-contradicted
policy
of
racial
assignment
of
faculties
that
applied
to
every
school
in
the
system,
that
was
system
wide
segregation.
we
had
a
system
wide
high
school,
a
dual
overlapping
high
school
zone
and
the
classic
predation
of
blacks
at
dunbar
and
also
in
1952,
reorganization,
which
is
characterized
in
this
record
as
the
westside
reorganization,
there
you
had
an
expanding
black
population.
in
order
to
provide
school
space
for
that
population,
the
defendants
contracted
the
boundaries
of
the
original
black
schools
that
made
them
tighter
boxes,
locked
them
in
to
those
boxes
and
expanded
the
boundaries
of
the
periphery
schools,
which
already
have
substantial
black
enrolments
inward
to
give
them
a
larger
share
of
that
black
population.
at
the
same
time,
they
cancelled
their
open
transfer
policy,
which
had
permitted
whites
to
get
out
of
any
situation
where
they
did
not
want
to
stay,
but
instead
substituted
for
it
a
series
of
optional
attendance
zones
around
the
westside
stools
on
the
white
side
of
the
periphery
allowing
whites
to
get
out
of
those
schools.
simultaneously
with
that
and
in
the
context
of
their
policy
on
faculty,
they
began
assigning
black
teachers
to
those
schools,
so
that
those
schools
eventually
became
identified
as
the
new
black
schools.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
this
happened
in
1952,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
your
honor,
the
facts
in
1971
are
a
product
of
what
happened
in
the
establishment
of
the
central
black
core.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
that
is
correct
and
at
the
time
of
trial
your
honor,
the
dayton
board
had
just
ended
as
of
71
the
racial
assignment,
racially
motivated
the
assignment
of
faculty
to
schools,
however,
the
effects
of
that
racially
motivated
assignment
still
persisted
because
schools
were
still
identified
as
white
or
black.
at
the
time
of
trial,
we
have
69
schools,
49
of
those
schools
were
90%
of
more
black
or
white,
there
are
21
black
schools
and
28
white
schools.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
i
think
what
is
required
is
the
finding
that
there
was
a
pattern
of
the
jury
segregation
and
at
the
time
of
brown
or
thereafter,
or
that
the
segregation
that
existed
pre
brown,
at
the
time
of
brown
and
throughout
this
period
has
detailed
and
far
more
detailed
than
i
can
in
this
argument.
whether
or
not
that
affected
substantially
the
districts
so
as
to
shift
the
burdens
of
it
to
go
forward
and
demonstrate
that
the
segregation
is
not
its
responsibility
and
i
do
not
think
it
meant
that
burden.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
yes,
your
honor
there
is
because
if
it
were
not
then
in
1954,
no
school
district
can
in
the
south
which
had
segregated
its
schools
pursuant
to
state
law
are
in
no
pursuant
to
its
own
will.
it
was
not
defaulted
at
that
same
school
remained
in
all
black
school
in
1971
as
it
did
when
this
--
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
that
is
correct.
that
the
fact
that
it
was
done
in
1929
whether
it
was
done
by
the
action
of
the
school
board
in
segregating
that
school
in
assigning
students
in
a
manner
which
created
forcibly
the
segregation
in
that
school
would
not
be
excused
by
the
fact
that
it
was
done
in
1929
if
the
effects
of
the
original
assignment
persisted
today.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
i
think
that
the
action
of
the
school
board
in
segregating
students
is
illegal,
but
it
was
done
in
1929
or
1971
or
1977.
i
think
that
is
the
teaching
of
brown.
i
think
that
is
the
application
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
otherwise,
everybody
who
had
acted
before
brown
is
excused.
i
would
like
to
detail
if
i
can
since
i
think
it
is
particularly
important
in
effects
the
district
in
the
system
wide
way
the
facts
with
respect
to
faculty
in
the
changing
policy.
the
1952,
board
changed
its
policy
only
slightly,
but
did
so
in
such
a
way
i
think
to
further
maximize
the
racial
insult
of
that
policy.
what
it
said
was
is
that
some
whites
reassigned
to
negro
schools
where
they
previously
were
only
negro
teachers,
but
there
would
be
no
assignments
of
whites
to
those
schools
against
their
will.
said
that
negro
teachers
would
be
mixed
in
white
schools,
only
where
the
whites
evidence
that
they
are
“ready”
to
accept
negro
teachers.
that
policy
persisted
in
dayton
effectively
until
the
1969
agreement
with
hew
which
went
into
effect
in
1971.
that
is
what
system
wide
historic
policy
that
is
not
disputed
was
intentional
affects
the
ratio
identifiability
of
every
school
in
the
system,
it
affects
the
kinds
of
decisions
that
were
made
and
it
is
the
exact
environment
for
segregation
that
this
court
has
talked
about
in
swann.
the
government
argues
and
i
think
it
tracks
the
argument
in
our
brief
that
there
are
a
number
of
undisputed
facts
in
the
record.
in
addition
to
the
three
specifics,
whether
they
would
be
stated
in
summary
form
or
be
limited
to
just
the
words
as
they
appear
and
i
think
you
can,
i
think
district
judge
was
talking
cumulatively
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
speaking
in
general
terms,
not
as
precisely
as
this
court
might
like
or
we
might
like,
but
nevertheless
plaintiff.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
yes,
we
do
your
honor.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
as
precise
as
it
might
have
done
and
all
we
think
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
well,
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
--
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
not
as
much,
your
honor
because
we
do
not
read
them
--
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
emphasis,
your
honor.
we
agreed
basically
with
the
government’s
position.
what
we
do
not
agree
with
is
that
the
sixth
circuit
misunderstood
the
facts
and
the
record
that
was
before
them,
the
arguments
that
was
presented,
and
thought
that
they
were
only
ruling
the
ratio
and
balance.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
i
do
not
think
i
have
to
convince
this
court
that
the
court
of
appeals
misunderstood
the
facts.
i
think
for
us
to
prevail,
we
have
to
show
that
the
judgments
and
not
all
the
language
or
all
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
judgments
they
made
are
supported
by
the
record,
the
undisputed
evidence
and
the
facts
that
were
found
by
all
of
the
courts
below.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
has
reversed
the
district
court
and
so
far
as
the
district
court
thought
that
dual
meant
state
imposed,
or
that
they
was
not
the
jury
segregation
because
the
court
of
appeals
spelled
it
out.
they
thought
clearly
enough
when
they
said
look,
when
we
were
talking
about
segregation
,
we
meant
the
jury
segregation,
they
said
that
on
the
segregation.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
i
think
they
did
not
articulate
the
legal
standard
or
the
full
basis
for
their
opinion
as
clearly
as
they
might
and
i
think
that
is
what
the
government
is
saying.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
i
think
that
the
district
court
--
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
i
think
that
normally,
the
court
of
appeals
has
applied
the
wrong
legal
standard
thus
vacate
and
remanded
for
applications
correctly
will
stand
in.
i
do
not
think
that
is
what
happened,
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
fail
to
spell
out
in
detail
all
of
the
basis
--
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
they
did
not
articulate
it
as
clearly.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
well,
i
think
they
understood
the
facts
very
well.
i
think
they
have
felt
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
spell
out
everything
that
was
admitted
in
request
for
admissions
or
everything
that
the
parties
were
not
in
dispute
about
and
therefore
required
no
adversary
findings
by
any
court.
i
think
that
the
record
overwhelmingly
supports
it,
and
as
the
government
points
out,
you
are
not
going
to
get
a
stronger
set
of
facts
in
a
non-jury
state
if
you
will
upon
which
district
court
conveys
a
judgment.
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
rendered
the
right
decision
and
i
think
that
any
arguments
that
sort
of
plan
is
a
racial
balance
plan
falls
on
the
face
of
the
facts.
we
have
the
terminology
problems,
the
district
court,
or
the
court
of
appeals
may
have
had,
they
do
not
support
a
finding
that
there
was
racial
balance
argued.
it
seems
to
be
a
problem
if
a
district
judge
puts
in
his
opinion
a
number
today
other
than
the
page
numbers
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
then
he
is
accused
of
watering
racial
balance
and
i
do
not
know
what
they
can
do
because
a
balance
is
between
a
1
and
100%,
and
if
they
do
not
give
some
guidance
to
the
school
boards,
the
school
boards
come
back
and
ask
for
them.
they
ask
for
some
outlines,
some
parameters
and
the
figures
used
here
are
not
pulled
out
of
the
air,
they
are
not
some
professes
theory,
they
are
based
on
the
facts
and
the
system
and
incidentally,
the
plan
actually
ultimately
ordered
by
the
district
court
is
quite
similar
to
the
plan
adapted
by
the
regional
board
before
the
new
board
came
in
and
cancelled
it.
this
is
five
years
of
litigation
to
get
the
plan
that
the
dayton
board
have
to
studying
itself
and
board
members
admitted
the
violations
and
the
admissions
are
not
out
of
whole
clause.
there
is
a
basis
in
fact
for
those
admissions
and
for
us
to
say
that
has
no
effect,
no
probative
value
is
to
say
that
because
a
new
board
comes
in
then
whatever
the
old
board
admitted,
whatever
statements
they
made,
whatever
policies
they
play,
have
no
effect
and
i
think
this
court’s
opinions
teaches
otherwise.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
judge
rubin,
yes
sir.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
plus
or
minus,
it
is
really
1/3,
2/3
range
and
the
actual
operation
of
the
plan
ended
up
with
the
broader
range
and
we
specified
these
statistics.
i
think
it
is
44%
either
way.
but
as
i
say,
1
to
100
is
a
range
too.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
that
was
the
target,
the
guideline
to
start
with
to
work
from.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
that
is
correct
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
cautioned
against
any
such
interpretation
even
though
they
found
no
basis
for
the
defendants
suggestion
that
court
had
ordered
some
sort
of
annual
adjustments
are
constant
supervision
by
federal
court.
and
judge
rubin
was
very
careful
to
tell
the
board
if
you
have
got
any
changes
you
want
to
make,
you
have
got
any
problems,
you
have
got
any
schools,
you
think
should
not
be
included
in
this
plan,
you
have
any
practical
problems,
you
come
and
show
me.
it
was
no
such
sensitive
motions
that
are
resided
in
the
record
most
of
which
the
court
went
along
with.
the
only
thing
he
did
not
go
along
with
was
allowing
the
board
to
delay
these
segregation
another
three
years
who
face
it
in
and
i
think
that
is
entirely
proper
and
consistent
with
the
record.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
i
would
say
that
the
district
court
in
this
case
was
extraordinarily
careful
to
say
he
did
not
want
to
be
superintendent.
he
went
out
of
his
way
to
tell
the
defendants
that
they
were
going
to
run
the
schools
and
that
he
specifically
said
that
he
did
no
require
them
to
maintain
something
now
and
forever
or
for
his
lifetime.
there
is
no
such
problem
in
this
case
and
i
think
he
needs
suggestion
based
on
this
record
is
just
out
of
board.
it
just
does
not
fit
the
facts.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
i
think
the
starting
point
which
is
all
it
is,
is
appropriate.
it
is
no
different
as
we
compare
it
to
the
starting
point
in
swann
and
actually
it
permits
and
resulted
in
a
broader
range
of
assignments.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
well,
i
think
we
have
basically
a
question
of
somatic.
the
district
court
did
not
say,
if
it
ever
gets
beyond
this
point,
you
have
to
come
back
to
15%,
he
just
said
look,
this
is
a
guideline,
this
is
a
starting
point
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
his
last
two
opinions,
he
specifically
refers
to
the
swann
language.
it
is
not
a
case,
he
simply
was
not
aware
of
it.
he
specifically
referred
to
the
swann
language
and
cites
it
in
a
lengthy
footnote
i
believe
in
the
second
opinion.
so
he
knew
this
court’s
rule
and
i
think
he
faithfully
adhered
to
it
and
the
working
out
of
the
plan
is
really
the
best
proof
and
i
think
that
is
what
this
court
said
in
swann.
i
think
this
court
said,
if
we
thought
that
the
court
ordered
an
exact
ratio,
then
we
would
strike
it
down
and
i
think
that
is
proper.
i
said,
we
look
and
see
what
happen
and
what
the
district
judge
has
done
and
let
us
look
at
reality.
this
is
a
desegregated
school
system.
it
is
by
no
means
racially
balanced.
the
facts
are
before
the
court
and
i
think
that
the
district
judge
is
not
in
anyway
suggesting
some
sort
of
annual
reviews
or
fix
adherence
to
a
rigid
racial
ratio.
mr.
louis
r.
lucas
i
think
all
that
district
judge
is
really
saying
your
honor,
and
is
candid
the
way
as
possible
and
i
think
the
parties
understood
it
this
way,
is,
look,
if
you
get
in
the
range
you
are
going
to
be
presumptively
okay.
you
get
outside
of
that
you
have
got
a
problem
what
have
you,
what
he
was
trying
to
do
was
eliminate
a
pattern
that
substantially
disproportionate
schools.
and
if
you
are
talking
about
disproportion
of
schools
rising
out
of
constitutional
violation
then
you
have
to
have
some
measuring
stick,
and
every
school
board
i
might
add
your
honor
(inaudible)
swann.
so
they
can
have
a
target
for
their
planning.
now,
when
you
talk
about
working
it
out
with
buildings,
with
different
capacities,
with
different
enrolments
and
different
grade
levels,
it
never
comes
out
that
way.
we
say
in
our
brief
what
we
have
is
not
racial
balance.
we
have
typical
desegregation
and
it
is
working
in
dayton.
there
are
no
headlines
about
dayton.
i
think
the
school
board
has
done
a
good
job
in
trying
to
make
it
work
and
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
people
in
that
community
with
the
commitment
to
making
it
work
and
that
is
why
you
did
not
read
about
it
in
the
headline.
you
did
no
have
a
lot
of
political
posturing
and
posing.
i
think
there
is
enough
criticisms
of
school
boards
and
when
they
do
it
wrong,
it
need
not
to
be
said,
need
not
to
be
said
by
plaintiffs
when
they
do
it
right
as
they
finally
did
here.
