mr.
david
c.
greer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
david
greer
and
i
am
here
representing
the
dayton
ohio
board
of
education.
the
paramount
issue
that
we
present
involves
the
proper
fashioning
of
an
equitable
remedy
in
a
school
desegregation
case.
the
basic
principle
is
clear.
the
nature
of
the
violation
determines
the
scope
of
the
remedy.
our
concern
is
with
the
application
of
that
principle
to
a
case
where
the
finder
of
the
facts
determined
that
only
limited
segregatory
practices
exist
as
opposed
to
a
dual
system
either
mandated
or
under
the
keys
standards.
our
contention
is
that
a
system
wide
racial
balance
remedy
as
was
mandated
here
by
the
sixth
circuit
cannot
be
justified
equitably
or
constitutionally
by
such
factual
findings.
most
of
the
factual
contentions
that
were
raised
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
action
were
resolved
after
an
extended
trial,
some
five
years
ago
in
favor
or
the
board
of
education.
three
findings
were
determined
by
the
finder
of
the
facts
that
constitutes
what
it
termed
a
cumulative
violation
of
the
constitution.
those
three
findings
were
a
condition
of
racial
imbalance
in
the
schools
of
the
dayton
system,
the
rescission
of
resolutions
that
had
been
enacted
by
a
lame
duck
school
board,
and
the
existence
of
optional
zones
between
certain
schools
in
the
system.
the
trial
courts
specifically
found
and
in
its
opinion
after
the
first
remand
in
reviewing
the
keys
decision,
which
came
up
while
this
case
was
in
process,
specifically
found
that
at
no
time,
did
the
defendant
maintained
a
dual
system
of
education
and
specifically
found
that
this
case
does
not
involve
actions
taken
on
a
school
by
school
basis,
but
rather
segregatory
practices.
the
first
finding
that
was
made
on
this
case,
a
condition
of
racial
imbalance
does
not
amount
to
a
violation
of
the
constitution
of
this
country.
the
finding
with
respect
to
rescission
of
resolutions
i
think
it
is
clear
under
the
ruling
of
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
law
in
this
area
can
only
be
considered
a
violation
of
a
constitutional
duty
to
the
extent
that
a
constitutional
duty
to
act
existed
at
the
time
the
original
resolutions
were
adapted.
mr.
david
c.
greer
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
mean
to
be
understood.
there
is
no
question
it
was
conceded
at
the
outset
that
there
is
racial
imbalance
in
the
schools
in
the
dayton
system.
the
issue
is
that
the
racial
--
mr.
david
c.
greer
and
it
is
clear
under
the
case
law
that
it
is
not
a
constitutional
violation
unless
that
condition
exists
because
of
intentional
segregatory
acts
of
the
school
board
and
the
finding
in
this
case
was
simply
that
there
was
a
condition
of
racial
imbalance
and
that
it
was
consistent
with
the
disbursement
of
the
population
in
the
dayton
area.
in
other
words,
the
evidence
referred
to
actual
census
tracks
as
to
where
the
populations
where
located
and
that
trial
court
specifically
found
that
the
racial
imbalance
that
existed
in
the
dayton
schools
reflected
exactly
what
the
residential
racial
imbalance
in
the
community
was.
i
would
also
point
out
in
this
regard;
the
court’s
findings
and
they
were
facts
that
were
as
indisputable
as
the
racial
imbalance
in
the
schools
that
the
boundaries
of
the
various
schools
in
this
area
had
seen
no
modifications
to
amount
to
anything
for
a
period
of
some
20
years
before
the
suit
was
filed.
and
that
as
the
population
in
the
dayton
area
moved
so
changed
the
percentages
of
black
to
white
students
in
the
various
schools
serving
the
residential
areas.
what
the
point
that
i
want
to
make
with
regard
to
the
three
findings
in
this
case
is
that
there
is
only
one
of
those
findings
that
is
standing
alone
could
be
considered
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution.
the
cracks
or
the
keystone
of
the
findings
of
fact
in
this
case
was
the
finding
with
respect
to
optional
zones.
small
areas
between
two
schools
where
a
student
living
in
the
area
would
have
an
option
of
going
to
either
of
those
two
schools.
the
findings
of
fact
here
were
those
optional
areas
and
there
were
some
150
of
them
at
one
point
in
the
history
of
the
school
were
generally
placed
there
because
of
the
choice
of
walking
one
more
block
to
school
as
opposed
to
going
over
railroad
tracks
or
wolf
creek
or
what
have
you.
the
court
did
find
and
mentioned
four
out
of
all
these
optional
zones
that
may
have
had,
i
think
was
the
court’s
phrase,
some
racial
significance
at
the
time
of
their
creation.
the
court
found
as
a
fact
that
the
majority
of
these
zones
had
no
racial
significance
as
the
time
of
their
creation
and
it
further
found
that
none
of
the
elementary
school
optional
zones
had
any
racial
significance
of
any
kind
at
the
time
this
lawsuit
was
filed.
that
left
three
of
the
four
optional
zones
mentioned
by
the
court
as
having
any
racial
significance
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
this
lawsuit
and
as
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
i
will
not
try
to
go
through
all
the
factual
arguments
here
or
the
factual
findings,
it
is
clear
that
the
effect
of
these
three
zones
which
were
high
school
optional
zones
was
limited
and
minimal.
the
reason
we
are
here
before
you
this
afternoon
is
that
these
factual
findings
have
triggered
off
a
system
wide
remedy
in
the
dayton
school
district
by
which
each
and
every
school
in
the
system
is
required
to
reflect
the
system
wide
racial
balance
plus
or
minus
15%.
in
the
brief
which
we
filed,
we
were
confident
enough
of
our
position
to
state
not
only
that
the
remedy
here
must
be
rewritten,
but
also
that
the
only
way
that
the
plaintiffs
would
hope
to
avoid
a
rewriting
of
the
remedy
would
be
to
rewrite
the
factual
findings
and
i
submit
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
has
been
requested
to
do
in
the
various
briefs
that
had
been
filed
in
opposition
to
our
position.
the
plaintiff’s
brief
tacitly
concedes
our
position.
it
does
not
attempt
to
justify
the
system
wide
remedy
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
that
were
found.
first
it
attempts
to
stretch
the
factual
findings
beyond
their
evidentiary
content
and
second,
the
challenges,
the
failure
of
the
trial
court
to
adapt
the
plaintiff’s
position
on
the
other
factual
issue
is
presented.
the
justice
department’s
brief
in
a
more
straightforward
manner
explicitly
and
expressly
concedes
our
position.
the
brief
says
and
i
have
to
quote
to
you
because
if
i
have
to
quote
somebody,
i
like
to
quote
my
adversary
when
i
can.
mr.
david
c.
greer
the
brief
agrees
with
us
that
the
three
part
cumulative
violation
that
the
court
found
would
not
support
the
remedy
that
--
mr.
david
c.
greer
then
we
get
down
to
the
point
of
rewriting
the
facts
mr.
justice
white,
and
i
would
proposed
to
the
court
four
separate
reasons
why
you
should
not
succumb
to
the
temptation
if
it
is
a
temptation
to
adapt
that
kind
of
an
argument
establish
a
whole
new
brand
of
law
in
this
area
and
in
essence
what
i
think
these
four
reasons
should
satisfy
you,
i
hope
is
that
you
should
accept
the
facts
as
found
by
the
trier
of
the
facts
and
adjust
the
remedy
rather
than
accepting
the
remedy
and
adjusting
the
findings
of
fact.
first,
i
would
submit
that
the
facts
in
this
case,
including
the
fact
of
a
non-dual
system
and
either
the
statutory
or
the
key
sense
of
the
term
have
been
determined
as
the
law
provides
they
should
be
determined
and
no
appeal
was
taken
by
the
plaintiffs
from
the
trial
court’s
findings
as
to
a
non-dual
system.
secondly,
i
would
point
out
that
there
was
not
finding
of
intentionally
segregative
school
board
actions
in
a
significant
or
meaningful
portion
of
the
school
system
and
that
there
was
therefore
no
basis
for
shifting
the
school
authorities
the
burden
of
proving
that
racially
imbalance
schools
within
the
system
were
not
the
result
of
intentionally
segregative
actions.
mr.
david
c.
greer
if
you
disagree
with
me
i
think
you.
mr.
david
c.
greer
on
that
particular
point?
mr.
david
c.
greer
that
is
the
question
of
was
it
in
a
meaningful
or
significant
section
of
the
school
then
there
would
be
a
shift
of
burden
and
i
think
my
response
to
that
would
be
clear
and
that
is
really
my
third
plight
here,
and
that
is
that
even
if
the
burden
were
shifted,
the
school
board
did
not
sit
silent
through
this
three
or
four
weeks
of
hearings.
we
did
present
evidence
on
each
of
these
issues
that
was
presented
and
the
facts
in
the
record,
support
a
finding
that
even
if
the
keys
presumption
had
been
called
into
effect
of
the
presumption
is
after
all
a
rebuttable
presumption
and
the
trial
court
found
that
the
arguments
that
were
made
should
be
rejected
and
that
the
racial
imbalance
in
the
schools
in
the
system
was
not
the
result
of
intentional
segregatory
actions
by
the
school
board.
mr.
david
c.
greer
as
i
understand,
the
justice
department’s
position
which
i
must
confess
i
received
in
the
fifth
day
of
a
trial
that
i
am
presently
engaged
in,
in
cincinnati,
after
completely
agreeing
with
all
my
position
in
this
case,
they
would
ask
this
court
to
look
to
the
record
making
all
new
finding
of
fact,
which
is
contrary
to
the
findings
of
fact
that
has
been
made,
taking
historical
practices
that
exist
or
historical
situations
that
happened
in
1926
or
in
1933
and
then
by
some
leap
of
logic
presumed
by
that
there
was
in
fact
a
dual
system
in
dayton
as
of
1954.
this
gets
into
a
whole
lot
of
factual
arguments
which
has
been
made
and
i
might
find
out
that
today,
we
did
file
with
the
clerk
to
supplement
the
record
the
brief
that
we
have
filed
in
the
sixth
circuit
on
our
initial
appeal
in
this
case
where
we
went
through
those
facts.
mr.
david
c.
greer
i
have
not
gotten
to
it,
but
i
will
do
that
right
now,
your
honor.
the
fourth
reason
and
i
think
this
is
as
good
reason
as
the
other
three
is
that
if
the
remedial
goal
in
a
suit
of
this
nature
is
as
this
court
stated
in
milliken
to
restore
the
victims
of
discriminatory
conduct
to
the
position
they
would
have
occupied
in
the
absence
of
such
conduct.
a
system
wide
remedy
is
inappropriate
whereas
here
in
dayton,
the
evidence
establishes
that
the
racial
composition
of
the
schools
reflected
the
changing
racial
composition
of
the
neighborhoods
that
were
serve
by
those
schools
and
the
attendance
zones
and
boundaries
of
these
schools
met
with
no
significant
change
over
the
20
years
that
elapsed
before
the
suit
was
filed.
i
submit
to
this
court
and
anybody
else
who
wants
to
ask
me
that
there
would
have
been
no
difference
in
the
composition
of
the
schools
in
the
dayton
school
system
at
the
time
this
lawsuit
was
filed,
regardless
of
how
any
act
in
1926
or
practice
in
1933
or
finding
a
fact
in
this
case
with
regard
to
optional
zones
is
characterized.
just
to
be
specific
on
that
point,
the
schools
in
the
dayton
system
as
of
1954
when
the
brown
case
was
decided
consisted
of
four
schools
that
were
composed
of
an
entirely
black
student
population.
24
schools
that
had
a
mixed
population
of
black
and
white
students,
and
21
of
white
schools.
during
the
20
years
that
elapsed
before
the
filing
of
this
suit
were
no
significant
boundary
changes
and
the
schools
needs
various
mixtures
were
affected
only
by
population
change.
there
is
a
little
pocket
in
the
eastside
of
dayton,
the
washington
elementary
school
serves
that
area
and
the
composition
of
the
student
body
in
that
school
has
been
somewhere
around
23
or
so
percent
consistently
through
this
entire
20-year
period.
other
schools
during
these
20
years
were
entirely
white
in
their
student
bodies
at
one
point
or
mixed
at
one
point,
and
as
population
shifted,
the
composition
of
the
school
shifted.
so
that
by
the
end
of
the
period,
certain
schools
were
predominantly
black
and
you
can
list
them.
so
that
this
is
my
fourth
point
that
i
would
present
to
the
court
that
if
the
purpose
of
a
remedy
in
this
kind
of
a
case
is
to
restore
a
condition
that
would
have
exited
but
for
constitutional
violations,
there
is
no
basis
here
for
a
system
wide
remedy.
now,
i
am
sure
the
court
is
going
to
have
a
lot
of
questions
for
me
as
well
as
for
my
opponents,
those
are
our
four
main
answers
to
what
has
been
an
effort
as
i
see
it
to
try
to
persuade
this
court
to
rewrite
the
facts.
i
do
not
think
that
is
a
request
that
should
be
accepted
by
this
court.
we
are
not
here,
it
seems
to
me
to
determine
the
correctness
of
the
trial
court’s
findings.
what
we
are
here
to
determine
is
to
whether
the
findings
of
fact
that
had
been
made
in
this
case
support
the
remedy
that
has
been
imposed.
it
seems
to
me
what
the
department
of
justice
and
what
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
asking
is
that
this
court
designate
itself
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
as
fact
finding
commissions
in
every
school
desegregation
case
that
is
filed,
that
i
submit
is
not
a
proper
appellate
function
and
that
is,
i
submit
the
job
of
the
prior
of
the
facts
the
trial
court
who
has
the
opportunity
to
develop
those
facts
on
a
witness
by
witness
basis
through
the
pressure
of
cross
examination
and
through
examination
of
the
witnesses.
now,
as
far
as
the
historical
facts
that
are
attempted
to
be
put
together
out
of
a
cold
record
in
the
brief
that
was
filed
by
department
of
justice.
i
would
submit
that
those
facts
simply
leave
great
logical
gaps
that
were
filled
in
at
the
trial
of
this
case.
there
has
not
been
any
instance
cited
to
this
court
because
there
is
none
available
for
citation
where
a
student
in
the
dayton
school
system
was
ever
excluded
from
any
school
because
of
his
grades.
there
was
an
instance
back
in
1926
when
a
group
of
students
at
an
elementary
school
garfield
were
taught
in
a
separate
building
behind
the
main
school
that
was
a
subject
of
a
suit
in
1926
and
that
practice
was
eliminated
and
that
practice
existed
and
was
eliminated
some
four
generations
of
students
before
this
case
was
filed.
mr.
david
c.
greer
they
said
essentially
the
same
thing.
they
affirmed
the
finding
that
there
was
a
cumulative
violation.
mr.
david
c.
greer
your
honor,
i
am
lost
in
that
somatic
problem
myself,
but
i
gathered
that
the
sense
in
which
they
use
the
term
cumulative
is
that
the
innocuous
fact
of
racial
imbalance
coupled
with
an
optional
zone
that
could
aggravate
that
racial
imbalance
between
two
schools
when
looked
at
together
or
cumulatively
could
be
considered
a
constitutional
violation.
i
think
that
is
the
sense
in
which
the
court
meant
to
use
that
term.
i
think
that
makes
some
sense.
mr.
david
c.
greer
we
are
not
challenging
the
findings
of
the
trier
of
the
fact
which
is
the
law,
in
the
law.
that
is
true.
our
position
is
and
we
have
set
it
forth
in
the
brief
there
was
only
one
of
this
that
amounted
to
anything
at
all
if
you
take
the
tables
that
are
attached
in
the
appendix
as
to
the
populations
of
these
various
schools.
you
will
find
even
that
optional
zone
which
was
between
roosevelt
and
colonel
white
high
schools
and
existed
essentially
unchanged
during
this
period,
except
for
the
addition
of
two
city
blocks
at
one
point
affected
something
like
½
of
1%
or
1%
of
the
black
students
in
the
entire
system.
mr.
david
c.
greer
we
certainly
do
not
concede
but
i
think
i
have
fly
in
the
face
of
the
record
to
suggest
it
your
honor.
i
have
reserve
some
time
for
my
rebuttal
if
i
may
and
i
would
like
to
take
that
time
now.
i
just
like
to
say
one
more
thing
with
respect
to
the
optional
zones.
the
finding
of
intent
here
which
we
concede
and
then
do
not
argue
was
that
while
most
of
these
optional
zones
were
placed
there
out
of
perfectly
honest
and
neutral
considerations.
for
example,
if
you
even
take
the
one
that
is
the
problem,
the
one
between
roosevelt
and
colonel
white,
we
have
got
the
dayton
tire
&
rubber
co.
who
we
have
got
wolf
creek,
we
have
got
railroad
tracks,
and
we
had
it
one
time
this
dayton
stockyards
that
presented
some
problem
for
children
going
to
the
closer
of
those
two
schools.
but
the
court
found
that
in
determining
the
optional
zones,
the
school
board
did
take
into
account
feelings
of
the
community
whether
they
want
it
or
not
and
in
that
respect,
some
insidious
intent
may
have
crept
into
the
decision
in
these
few
zones.
and
certainly,
what
we
do
not
concede
is
that
there
was
any
meaningful
or
substantial
portion
of
this
district
effect.
mr.
david

greer
three
high
schools.
mr.
david
c.
greer
because
there
is
also
the
high
school
kiser
involved
in
another
one
of
the
optional
zones
where
there
was
a
finding.
mr.
david
c.
greer
dunbar
was
an
optional
school
which
was
not
involved
in
this
finding.
dunbar
bar
at
the
time
of
the
suit
was
filed
had
its
own
district
just
like
any
attendance,
boundary,
just
like
any
other
school.
there
was
a
time
when
dunbar
was
an
optional
school
in
the
sense
that
any
black
student
living
anywhere
in
the
city
could
have
his
choice
of
attending
either
of
the
school
in
his
area
or
dunbar
high
school.
mr.
david
c.
greer
1962,
i
believe
it
was.
mr.
david
c.
greer
there
are
10
at
present.
mr.
david
c.
greer
i
will
probably
be
assassinated
by
the
chamber
of
commerce
if
i
concede
that
the
population
of
dayton
changes
by
whatever
means
that
they
use
to
assess
it
whether
it
be
the
90-minute
marker
or
the
exact
boundaries
of
the
city.
the
school
population
is
at
this
relevant
time
set
forth
in
the
appendix
and
i
will
have
to
check
it
or
use
my
brains
that
is
either
table
here
to
give
it
to
you
precisely.
mr.
david
c.
greer
i
received
it
in
the
middle
of
an
opening
statement
last
friday
your
honor,
yes
and
have
no
objection
to
their
filing
of
amicus
brief.
mr.
david
c.
greer
i
realized
it
is
late
and
i
have
not
had
a
chance
to
--
mr.
david
c.
greer
no,
i
do
not
oppose
it.
mr.
david
c.
greer
thank
you.
mr.
david
c.
greer
i
cannot
take
you
back
past
green,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
david
c.
greer
no,
these
were
all
prior
to
that
time.
a
few
points
that
i
would
like
to
touch
upon
that
i
think
are
responsive
to
points
that
were
raised
in
mr.
lucas’
argument.
first
of
all,
to
be
precise
the
date
the
suit
was
filed
was
in
april
of
1972
rather
than
a
1971.
in
fairness
too,
the
finder
of
the
facts
in
this
case,
i
would
like
to
have
it
clear
on
the
record
as
to
what
his
finding
was
with
regard
to
a
dual
system.
i
think
there
was
some
question
raised
as
to
whether
he
had
some
mental
confusion
and
was
thinking
of
dual
systems
solely
in
the
conducts
of
a
statutory
mandated
dual
system.
i
think
you
will
find
that
it
is
clearly
not
the
case
and
i
would
refer
you
to
pages
75
and
77
of
the
appendix
where
he
specifically
talks
in
one
paragraph
about
a
mandated
dual
system
in
the
statutory
sense
and
then
goes
on
in
another
paragraph
to
talk
about
what
we
are
talking
about
is
activities
that
were
segregative
and
that
at
no
time,
was
there
a
dual
system
of
education
maintained,
and
on
page
77
he
again
distinguishes,
we
do
not
deal
with
a
mandated
dual
system
and
we
do
not
deal
with
actions
taken
on
the
school
by
school
basis,
i.e.
a
keys
type.

the

volume
of
the
appendix
in
the
third
paragraph.
now
as
to
the
situations
that
were
cited
as
to
garfield
and
willard
you
will
find
that
the
dates
there
are
1926
and
of
1933
i
believe
it
is.
as
far
as
assignment
of
black
staffs,
those
events
did
occur
at
these
schools
after
the
schools
had
become
black
in
their
composition
as
far
as
the
student
composition
was
concerned,
those
events
were
1936
for
garfield,
1936
for
willard
and
1945
for
wagaman.
long,
long
before
this
and
as
far
as
the
assignment
of
faculty
is
concerned
that
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
as
the
plaintiff’s
own
expert
dr.
green
testified
with
the
community
perception
of
the
schools
and
of
course
all
occurred
several
generations
prior
to
the
filing
of
this
suit.
the
policy
is
the
teachers
changed
in
1950
and
white
teachers
began
to
be
assigned
to
black
or
mixed
schools.
there
was
a
whole
change
in
this
policy
until
the
year
before
the
suit
was
filed.
the
faculty
and
the
entire
dayton
school
system
was
balanced
in
a
system
wide
ratio
basis
in
all
of
the
schools
and
a
year
before
the
suit
was
filed.
i
do
not
have
time,
i
realized
to
go
step
by
step
through
the
intent.
i
would
encapsulate
it
with
voltaire's
(ph)
axioms
that
history
can
be
defined
as
a
bag
of
tricks
played
by
the
dead
upon
the
living.
there
was
no
trace
of
any
of
these
practices
at
the
time
this
suit
was
filed
nor
if
we
go
back
and
inquire
into
intent
as
far
as
these
various
practice
were
concerned,
was
there
any
insidious
intent
at
the
time
the
practices
occurred
nor
did
any
of
them
result
any
exclusion
of
any
children
from
any
school
because
of
their
race?
mr.
david
c.
greer
it
is
in
effect.
mr.
david
c.
greer
no
stay
was
granted.
mr.
david
c.
greer
the
decree
was
dated
last
march.
i
believe
it
is
the
date
and
then
affirmed
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
june.
mr.
david
c.
greer
and
i
think
mr.
lucas
is
correct
that
the
community
here
has
done
a
commendable
job.
i
do
not
think
that
is
necessarily
any
reason
to
say
that
this
plan
is
justified
by
the
--
mr.
david
c.
greer
the
relief
that
i
ask
in
this
case
is
that
is
i
think
i
stated
on
the
last
page
of
my
brief,
i
think
at
this
point,
this
case
should
be
dismissed
that
the
violations
that
were
found
to
have
been
occurred
have
been
corrected.
there
are
no
optional
zones
in
this
system.
the
schools
that
were
affected
by
those
zones
have
either
been
eliminated
or
they
have
been
structured
so
that
they
reflect
the
system
wide
racial
balance.
i
think
the
school
board
should
be
free
at
this
point
to
decide
what
additional
programs
they
should
retain,
or
reject,
or
modify
in
their
attempt
to
make
this
a
fine
school
system.
