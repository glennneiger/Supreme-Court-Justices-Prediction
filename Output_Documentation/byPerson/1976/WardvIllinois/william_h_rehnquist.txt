justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now
you
want
to
suggest
that
the
three-judge
district
court?s
interpretation
of
illinois
law
should
be
taken
in
preference
to
the
interpretation
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
would
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
be
a
federal
constitutional
objection
to
the
illinois
conviction,
but
i
thought
you
said
that
we
should
prefer
the
three-judge
district
court?s
interpretation
of
illinois
law
to
that
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
the
three-judge
federal
court
had
accepted
the
construction
of
the
illinois
statute
put
upon
it
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
held
that
is
unconstitutional.
