mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
response
to
key
the
question
raised
in
this
appeal,
the
state
of
illinois
submits
that
chapter
38,
section
11-20
(b)
its
obscenity
statute
definition
has
been
construed
by
illinois
courts
both
prior
to
and
after
this
court's
decision
in
miller
versus
california,
so
as
to
limit
its
definition
of
obscenity
to
patently
offensive
portrayals
or
specific
sexual
conduct,
thus
giving
proper
notice
of
the
offense
of
selling
obscene
materials
and
allowing
the
application
of
statute
under
the
constitutional
standards
annunciated
in
miller.
now,
this
case
of
course
presents
the
post-miller
problem
of
what
states
have
to
in
order
to
comply
with
the
constitutional
requirements
of
miller
versus
california.
there
were
many
different
approaches
taken
by
the
states
after
1973
in
trying
to
bring
themselves
into
line
with
the
miller
requirements.
there
have
been
the
different
kinds
of
approaches
have
been
alluded
to
both
in
appellant?s
and
the
appellee?s
brief.
very
often
legislation
was
employed.
more
often
some,
sort
of,
construction
of
statutes
by
the
state
high
courts
was
involved,
and
even
within
those
group
of
states
that
decided
to
construe,
to
re-construe
their
statutes
to
satisfy
miller,
there
was
a
great
diversity
of
opinion
as
to
how
this
should
be
properly
accomplished
and
what
this
case
preserves,
it
focuses
on
one
technique
employed
to
construe
a
state
statute
into
line
with
miller.
one
technique
out
of
an
entire
spectrum
of
techniques
employed,
and
ask
you
to
decide
whether
or
not
this
is
a
proper
construction
of
illinois
statute
in
line
with
miller
or
whether
the
illinois
supreme
court
missed
the
boat,
they
used
the
wrong
words,
they
should
start
over
again
and
perhaps
follow
some
other
technique.
and
i
think
it
is
true
to
say
that
in
the
spectrum
of
attempts
to
comply
with
this
court?s
miller
requirements
by
construing
state
statutes,
you
start
at
one
end
with
those
states
that
took
the
approach
which
apparently
is
adopted
by
the
appellant
here
and
was
adopted
by
the
court,
a
three-judge
court
in
the
eagle
books
case
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
that
is
the
very
literal
approach
that
in
order
do
it
right,
the
state
court
has
to
sit
down
and
say
here
are
the
miller
examples,
here
are
the
miller
requirements,
we
do
now
hereby
incorporate
those
requirements
and
those
examples
into
our
state
statute
as
providing
the
limitations
as
what
can
be
prosecuted
under
that
statute.
that
is
the
literalist
approach
and
several
states
took
that
approach,
notably
florida
and
alabama
and
texas.
then
there
is,
i
think
in
the
middle,
the
illinois
approach,
where
the
examples
are
reprinted,
the
standards
are
mentioned,
and
there
is
a
blanket
statement
that
re-construed
the
illinois
statute
as
incorporating
these
standards
and
examples.
then
on
the
far
other
end
of
the
spectrum,
you
have
some
state
courts
that
attempted
to
accomplish
this
purpose,
merely
by
making
an
oblique
reference
to
the
miller
standards.
as
for
the
example,
the
oklahoma
court
did
in
field
versus
hess
when
they
simply
noted
the,
they
bowed
in
the
direction
of
miller?s
standards
and
they
said
well
of
course
whenever
our
statute
is
applied,
the
miller
standards
are
implied,
without
getting
in
any
specifics
or
reprinting
them
at
all.
and
so
you
have
this
entire
spectrum
and
the
center
of
the
spectrum,
i
think
the
illinois
approach,
is
the
one
that
your
honors
are
requested
to
decide
at
this
time.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
illinois
supreme
court,
yes,
i
think
that
is
their
position.
i
think
that
and
this
is
i
think
there
are
two?
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
well,
what
they
did
was
your
honor,
i
believe,
state
that
the
illinois
statute
was
constitutional,
following
this
construction
and
i
think
they
also
expressed
the
opinion
that
the
statute
gave
required
specificity.
admittedly,
as
i
say
they
did
not
take
a
literalist
approach,
and
i
do
not
think
we
would
be
here
today
if
they
had
taken
a
literalist
approach,
but
i
think
that
is
not
necessary
for
them
to
have
taken
that
literal
approach
in
order
to
have
complied
with
miller.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
i
really
do
not
know
if
your
honor
that
is
correct
or
not.
i
cannot
speak
for?
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
they
did
pass
an
act,
yes
your
honor.
i
do
not
know
if
there
was
any,
if
that
was
comment
on
what
they
thought
the
illinois
supreme
court
have
done
or
not,
i
have
no
basis
for
saying
that,
but
i
think
this
points
out,
this
question,
which
you
have
just
asked,
points
out
what
i
think,
i
think
there
are
two
fundamental
weakness
in
the
approach
of
the
appellant
in
this
particular
case.
first
of
all
i
think
the
appellant
ignores
the
plain
intent
and
even
some
of
the
wording
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
when
it
decided
the
relevant
cases
of
people
versus
ridens,
second
time
around
ridens
ii
and
people
versus
gould,
i
think
they
ignore
the
statements
of
the
court
in
the
plain
intent
of
the
court
in
those
cases.
secondly,
and
to
me
much
more
unexplainable
is
the
complete
failure
to
recognize
the
long
and
detailed
history
of
obscenity
law
construction
in
illinois
prior
to
and
at
the
time
of
the
miller
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
illinois
appellate
courts.
it
is
not
true
to
say
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
had
only
considered
one
case
prior
to
1972
in
limiting
its
statute
or
that
it
only
considered
cases
involving
city
ordinances.
in
our
brief,
part
3,
pages
18,
19,
20
and
21,
we
have
collected
no
fewer
than
10
different
decisions
of
illinois
reviewing
courts
dealing
with
construction
and
application
of
the
illinois
obscenity
statute.
the
earliest
of
these
cases
is
people
versus
sikora,
a
1965
case,
which
dealt
with
a
number
of
books
that
were
brought
before
the
court
and
in
which
they
held
that
certain
specific
kinds
of
acts
and
i
do
not
want
to
offend
any
sensibilities
by
going
through
them,
they
are
listed
on
page
on
19,
including
sadism
and
masochism
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
page
19
of
our
brief,
including
sadism
and
masochism
were
obscene.
these
descriptions
in
these
books
were
obscene
under
the
federal
approach
at
that
time
and
under
the
illinois
statute.
this
was
followed
by
and
that
was
under
the
illinois
obscenity
statute,
not
a
not
a
state
ordinance
or
a
city
ordinance,
this
was
followed
by
the
city
of
the
23.05,
which
was
a
review
of
a
city
ordinance,
which
was
exactly
identical
to
the
state
statute
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
noted
that
in
the
decision
and
proceeded
to
deal
with
the
ordinance
as
if
it
were
dealing
with
the
statue,
they
were
indistinguishable,
the
one
is
simply
a
copy
of
the
other.
and
in
that
case
they
added
some
other
specific
types
of
actions
that
were
considered
to
be
obscene
under
the
statute.
then
you
get
to
the
case
of
the
city
of
chicago
versus
geraci,
which
my
opponent
mentioned,
that
is
the
third
case
down
the
line
from
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
yet
that
occurred
only
in
1970,
the
start
back
is
1970.
now,
in
that
case
truly
there
was
only
a
municipal
ordinance
that
was
concerned,
but
the
definition
of
obscenity
in
that
ordinance
was
much
broader
than
the
illinois
statutory
definition
and
the
court?s
concern,
it
used
cases
interchangeably
between
ordinance
consideration
and
statute
consideration
and
the
illinois
supreme
court?s
concern
clearly
was,
does
this
material
fall
under
constitutional
protection
or
does
it
not
and
i
will
submit
your
honor,
that
is
the
proper
approach
to
take
and
apply
any
obscenity
statute,
regardless
of
whether
it
is
a
state
statute
or
an
ordinance
and
regardless
of
what
its
wording
is
and
the
reasoning
of
the
geraci
case
applies
directly
to
the
type
of
situation
we
have
into
the
application
of
a
state
statutory
situation.
in
fact
justice
schaffer
who
decided
that
case,
quoted
liberally
from
his
sikora
opinion
earlier
which
involved
the
state
statute
and
then
without
going
through
all
of
them
there
are
host
of
other
cases,
decided
prior
to
and
during
1972
and
1973,
some
from,
not
half
of
the
appellate
court,
fewer
than
that
and
there
are
cases
at
least
three
prior
to
the
time
of
the
arrest
in
this
case
where
the
supreme
court
said
certain
things
are
not
prohibited
by
obscenity
statute
and
one
of
the
things
interestingly
they
said
in
geraci
was
that
mere
nudity
was
not
prohibited
by
the
state
statute.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
i
do
not
think
they
did
your
honor.
i
cannot
recall
specifically.
my
recollection
is
that
they
did
not
specifically
discussed
any
of
the
old
illinois
cases
prior
to
ridens
i
and
ridens
ii
and
i
think
that
is
a
problem
with
that
opinion
and
i
think
that
is
way
they
reached
the
conclusion
that
they
did
is
that
they
failed
to
go
back
into
this
prior
history
of
illinois
decisions,
which
of
course
the
illinois
supreme
court
had
i
think
in
mind
when
they
wrote
the
ridens
ii
case,
but
did
not
layout.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
well
your
honor,
first
of
all?
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
in
the
later
geraci
case
your
honor,
that
was
elaborated
a
little
bit
more
because
in
geraci
they
were
dealing
with
magazines
of
a
sadomasochistic
character
and
the
court
described
the
magazines,
justice
schaffer
described
them
in
a
part
of
that
geraci
opinion
and
indicated
his
belief
that
and
described
the
magazines
as
sadomasochistic
magazine,
which
contains
photographs
portraying
lesbianism,
rape,
whippings,
beatings,
bondage,
axing
and
other
abnormal
sexual
conduct
and
so
he
spelled
it
out
a
little
bit
more
in
geraci
and
he
said
that,
he
indicated
by
the
negative,
by
saying
that
this
was,
he
said
the
appellant
say
that
this
is
not
hardcore
pornography,
we
disagree,
so
he
is
indicating
that
it
was
hardcore
pornography.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
i
think
it
would
your
honor.
i
would
think
that
would?
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
this
gets,
pushes
me
back
to
the
point
of
having
to
admit
that
i
think
it
is
impossible
to
have
a
complete
scientific
catalog
of
all
the
types
of
actions,
which
are
cataloged
as
obscenity
and
are
prohibitable.
i
think
the
mind
of
man
goes
beyond.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
i
think
that
that
the
addition
of
these
specific
examples
that
this
court
give
miller
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
talked
about
and
in
the
many
courts
have
felt
the
setup
exactly
as
you
say,
for
example,
a
new
hampshire
supreme
court
in
the
case
that
my
opponents
cited
in
their
brief,
i
think
the
purpose
is
to
cover
the
most
common,
to
very
specifically
cover
the
most
common
types
of
obscenity
to
provide
the,
kind
of,
notice
to
a
bookseller
that
the
appellant
here
is
concerned
about.
he
can
look
at
these
examples,
these
statutes,
these
cases
and
he
can
go
down
and
he
pick
off
what
he
finds
in
his
magazines
or
books
and
he
can
probably
decide
99%
of
the
cases
on
the
basis
of
these
examples,
because
they,
while
not
completely
all
inclusive,
i
think
they
probably
do
cover
the
most
common,
most
frequent
types
of
obscenity
that
is
going
to
be
prosecuted
and
the
bookseller
is
going
to
come
into
contact.
there
may
be
borderline
situations
that
these
examples
cannot
cover,
as
with
the
drug
situation,
well,
i
would
not
mention
that,
but
as
the
mind
of
man
advance
new
types
of
activities,
they
are
going
to
be
borderline
cases
that
the
courts
are
going
to
have
to
rule
upon
and
i
think
this
court
recognized
that
in
miller
and
recognized
that
in
hamling,
specifically
said
that
path
by
itself,
that
path
is
not
sufficient
to
render
these
statutes
unconstitutional.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
yes
they
were
your
honor.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
i
think
you
could
still
uphold
the
conviction
your
honor.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
because
i
think,
because
they
were
lumped
together
it
is
one
offence
and
i
think
that,
especially
in
light
of
the
very
small
sentence
that
was
put
down,
one
day
in
jail
and
a
$200
fine
and
i
think
in
light
of,
if
he
was
peddling
one
magazine
that
was
obscene
out
of
the
two,
he
was
guilty
of
?a?
violation
of
illinois
obscenity
statute,
which
is
all
the
current
charges.
i
mean,
it
is
not
divided
in
two
counts.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
i
cannot
mention
a
specific
case
your
honor
to
answer
that
question.
my
belief
is
that
it
would
be
something,
the
reply
something
like
the
harmless
error
doctrine
to
say
that
the
conviction
was
founded
on
'a'
violation
of
obscenity,
and
therefore,
it
will
stand.
as
long
as
the
sentence
does
not
reflect
a
feeling
that
there
is
a
lot
of
offensiveness
here
and
that
society
had
to
punish
in
some
outrageous
fashion.
i
think
the
sentence
reflex
a
minimal.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
that
is
a
very
good
question
your
honor
because
of
course
the
miller
examples
do
not
mention
sadomasochism
specifically?
i
think
that
if
we
look
at
the
example?
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor
because?.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
i
think
under
these
examples,
the
examples
themselves
are
not
meant
to
be
a
catalog
of
everything.
i
think
that
there
are
different
kinds
of
activities
that
come
under
these
somewhat
general
terms
in
the
examples
and
i
would
say
that
this
kind
of
material
that
you
will
see
in
these
two
magazines,
bizarre
world
and
the
study
of
sadomasochism
can
come
under
either
of
two
examples
here
in
miller,
patently
offensive
representations
of
ultimate
sexual
acts
perverted,
actual
or
simulated.
i
think
that
if
it
is
fair
to
say
that
sadomasochistic
actions
of
the
type
described
here,
certainly
by
definition
sadomasochism
is
designed
to
arouse
sexual
interest
and
sexual
pleasure.
it
is
a
kind
of
sex
related
act
which
is
perverted
version
of
an
ultimate
sex
act
and
i
think
it
will
come
under
that.
secondly,
in
every
one
of
these
types
of
pictures,
and
there
are
many,
many
times
throughout
these
magazines
that
this
occurs,
you
have
lewd
exhibitions
of
the
genitals.
it
is
almost
impossible
in
the
type
of
magazines
that
these
are
for
you
to
have
the
pictorial
content
without
having
lewd
exhibition
of
the
genitals
and
so
i
think
it
comes
under
that
example
also.
the
two
possibilities
and
i
think
there
is
plenty
of
authority
for
the
proposition
that
it
is
pretty
well
excepted
that
sadomasochism
comes
under
these
examples
because
for
example
my
opponent?s
brief
when
he
talks
about
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
decision,
that
court
said,
?we
are
going
to
take
the
miller
examples
and
they
are
going
to
become
the
limits
of
new
hampshire
law,
but
we
are
going
to
spell
out
what
they
include
and
following
paragraph,
new
hampshire
supreme
court
said
those
examples
include
sadomasochistic
abuse.
similarly,
the
statutes
that
have
been
passed
by
very
conscious
legislatures
attempting
to
catalog
preciously?
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
the
harding
case
and
secondly
the
legislative
examples
that
have
followed
miller
where
they
try
to
be
as
specific
as
they
can,
the
ones
that
we
have
brought
to
our
attention
here,
for
example
the
louisiana
statute
that
is
also
quoted
in
my
opponent?s
brief.
the
oregon
statute
which
this
court
hold
with
approval
and
then
in
the
miller
case,
they
all
mention
sadomasochistic
abuse
as
being
a
type
of
obscenity
and
so
they
all
these
legislatures
think
that
that
falls
within
the
examples
that
your
honors
gave
in
the
miller
case.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
i
would
not
want
to
be
held
in
1%
of
your
honor,
but
i
think?.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
it
has,
illinois
supreme
court
may
answer
you
this
way
your
honor,
if
i
can,
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
stated
which
types
of
conduct
are
not
obscene.
in
cases
that,
and
so
have
the
appellate
court,
in
cases
which
came
up
and
said
this
is
a
borderline
situation,
is
that
obscene
or?
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
i
would
say
your
honor,
no
one
has
ever
said
that,
no
one.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that
was
a
surprise
really
your
honor.
i
would
be
willing
to
bet
that
if
we
took
the
most
specific
statute
in
land
and
went
down
it
with
an
obscenity
expert,
he
could
come
up
with
possible
combinations
or
versions
of
an
act
that
would
not
be
specifically
covered
in
that
list.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
which
would
be
prosecutable
until
some
court
said
here
is
the
definition,
here
is
the
act,
it
does
or
does
not
apply?
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
well,
i
think
what
that
means
is
that
there
has
to
be
a
definition,
there
has
to
be
a
substantial?.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
the
99%
definition.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
well,
i
think
no.
i
would
not
say
that
at
all.
i
think
what
that
means
is
that
at
some
point
in
a
given
?
of
course
anybody
can
be
prosecuted
for
anything.
the
question
is,
what
will
a
court
do,
if
the
prosecution
will
throw
it
out
or
not.
i
think
that
opinion
must
leave
open
the
possibility
of
judicial
review
and
application
of
the
definitions
to
whatever
the
prosecuting
attorney
is
charging
with
being
obscene,
that
is
all
i
am
saying,
and
i
am
saying
that
as
with
most
other
statutes,
it
is
impossible
to
be
a
100%
certain
that
every
possible
example
of
what
you
are
prohibiting
is
cataloged
in
that
statute.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
the
ultimate
test
is
what
a
court
of
the
state
or
federal
government
and
ultimately
this
court
believes
is
included
within
the
specific
examples
given
or
is
not
included,
i
think
that
is
the
ultimate
test
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
possible
to
remove
that
function
from
the
courts.
i
do
not
think
it
is
possible
to
set
up
an
autonomous
little
operation
with
the
legislature
and
prosecuting
attorney
so
that
each
one
knows
exactly
every
thing
that
is
prohibitable
and
that
which
is
not.
i
think
you
have
to
rely
on
the
courts
for
the
ultimate
fine-tuning.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
yes
and
then
they
have
adopted
the
miller
examples,
but
every
word
indicated
the
miller
examples
themselves
are
not
a
very
long
catalog
and
they
have
many
possible
types
of
conducts
will
be
arguably
included
under
it.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
illinois
has,
that
is
true.
that
is
why
i
say
illinois
is
not
taken
the
literalist
approach,
but
illinois
has
said
more
than
some
states.
illinois
has
in
fact
said
that
it
has
specifically
in
ridens
ii,
the
court
reprinted
at
length
a
large
portion
of
this
court?s
miller?s
opinion
and
said
after
further
discussion,
we
now
construe
the
illinois
statute
as
incorporating
parts
a
and
b
of
the
miller
test,
which
included
in
their
reprint,
the
specific
examples
of
miller
obscenity
and
then
later
in
people
versus
gould
chief
justice
ward
went
on
to
reprint
this
whole
item
again
and
he
said
we
have
construed
our
statute
to
incorporated
parts
a
and
b
as
i
have
set
out
above
in
the
above
quotation,
again
referring
to
the
examples.
they
have
done
this
in
addition
to
the
constructions
that
they
have
already
placed
on
a
statute.
so
in
my
opinion
what
they
have
done
and
i
think
admittedly
my
job
would
be
much
easier
if
they
had
spelled
all
this
out,
but
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
their
prior
decisions
with
the
ridens
ii
and
the
gould
decision
indicates
what
they
have
done.
they
have
taken
this
court?s
miller?s
standards
and
examples
and
add
them
on
to
the
prior
the
decisions
of
the
illinois
supreme
court,
illinois
appellate
courts
for
an
amalgam
constitutional
standard
of
obscenity.
i
think
they
have
said
that
we
are
going
to
be
stick
by
what
we
have
done
in
the
past
because
it
was
correct.
in
addition,
we
are
going
inform
the
public
that
we
are
adding
on
the
miller
requirements
and
miller
examples
and
the
combination
of
this
will
be
applied
as
the
illinois
obscenity
statute
in
the
future.
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
they
were
careful
do
avoid
a
part
c
of
this
court's
miller's
test
which
reduced
utterly
without
redeeming
the
value
test.
they
have
said
that
that
was
already
an
illinois
law
and
that
there
were
going
to
keep
that
until
such
time
as
legislature
spoke
otherwise.
so
that
we
do
have
in
this
one
particular
standard
that
is
more
strict,
and
that
was
the
standard
by
the
way
that
was
applied
in
this
particular
case.
i
think
that
it
is
totally
incorrect
to
say
that
under
the
illinois
statute
even
on
its
face
that
mere
nudity
could
be
prosecuted
in
illinois,
other
than
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
said
in
geraci
that
it
cannot.
there
is
the
simple
fact
that
the
illinois
statute
requires
and
the
comments
to
the
statute
that
we
have
appended
to
the
first
part
of
our
brief,
i
think
are
very
illuminating
as
to
what
the
intent
of
the
legislature
was
back
in
1961
when
it
passed
the
statute,
and
they
said
it
and
it
is
written
in
the
statute
that
the
matter
of
being
accused
or
being
obscene
must
go
substantially
beyond
customary
limits
of
candor.
certainly,
in
this
day
and
age,
no
illinois
court
is
going
to
say
that
mere
nudity
goes
beyond
the
customary
limits
of
candor.
that
element
is
written
into
the
statute
to
prohibit
the
thing
that
was
suggested
here.
there
is
no
way
that
nudity
can
be
prosecuted
under
illinois
statute,
either
under
the
face
of
the
statute
or
under
the
illinois
decisions
that
have
come
down
following.
i
think
that
the
state?s
position
is
that
there
is
support
for
the
illinois
construction
of
the
statute
in
ridens
ii
and
in
people
versus
gould,
direct
support
for
it
in
this
court?s
opinion
in
hamling
versus
united
states.
i
think
substantially
the
same
approach
was
taken
by
this
court
as
by
the
illinois
supreme
court.
this
court
being
a
little
bit
more
specific,
but
i
think
the
approach
is
the
same.
there
is
also
direct
precedential
support
in
the
state
versus
watkins,
which
was
one
of
the
cases
like
ridens,
which
this
court
vacated
and
remanded,
and
sent
back
to
south
carolina
after
the
miller
decision
was
announced.
the
state
supreme
court
reaffirmed
its
prior
ruling
in
a
technique
not
to
dissimilar
to
the
illinois
technique
said
that
we
are
going
to
limit
our
statute
to
types
of
obscenity
such
as
those
listed
in
the
miller
examples.
that
case
came
back
up
to
this
court
on
appeal
and
the
appeal
was
dismissed
for
one
of
those
substantial
federal
questions.
so
i
think
those
are
two
direct
precedents
that
are
very
closely
analogous
in
justifying
the
decision
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
ridens
and
in
gould.
secondly,
i
would
simply
like
to
state
that
i
do
not
believe
it
is
true
that
if
this
court
?
well,
we
are
not
presented,
this
court
is
not
presented
here
with
the
question
of
whether
the
illinois
supreme
court
failed
to
obey
the
remand
of
a
case.
the
case
that
was
remanded
by
this
court
after
miller
was
people
versus
ridens,
ridens
versus
illinois
in
this
court.
that
case
of
course
went
through
the
miller
again
with
illinois
supreme
court
and
it
came
up
again
on
a
certiorari
petition
making
the
same
allegations
that
had
been
made
today
before
this
court
about
the
statute
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
by
a
5
of
4
vote.
this
case,
the
ward
case
comes
long
after
that
situation
and
of
course
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
remand
situation
here.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question,
your
honors
that
upon
reviewing
the
two
publications
involved
in
this
case
that
they
are
obscene
under
any
definition
of
hardcore
pornography.
the
only
publication
that
there
seems
to
be
dispute
about
even
between
the
parties
to
this
cause,
is
a
publication
called
bizarre
world
and
i
would
submit
to
the
your
honor
that
the
main
part
of
that
publication
is
a
16
page
full
color
pullout
?called
dungeon
domination?
and
in
that
particular
little
item
between
pages
14
and
43,
there
are
many
examples
of
torture
with
the
apparent
blood
on
the
victim
and
torture
and
lewd
exhibitions
of
the
genitals
and
i
would
submit
that
if
sadomasochism
itself
can
be
prohibited
by
obscenity
laws
then
this
indeed
is
obscenity
and
is
properly
considered
prohibitable
in
illinois.
the
other
publication,
it
does
not
seem
to
be
too
much
disagreement
between
the
parties.
i
think
that
there
can
be
no
problem
of
retroactivity
here.
i
think
if
he
had
consulted
counsel
in
1971
before
he
purchased
and
sold
these
magazines
and
we
looked
at
the
many
decisions,
prior
decisions
of
the
illinois
court,
which
deal
with
sadomasochism,
mr.
wesley
ward
would
have
known
that
he
was
selling
magazines
that
were
prohibitable
under
illinois
law
and
he
should
have
taken
warning
if
he
had
looked
and
noted
that,
he
should
have
had
proper
notice
that
this
was
prohibited
conduct
and
he
would
not
have
done
it.
i
think
there
is
no
question
here,
but
that
the
prior
construction
of
illinois
statutes
gave
wesley
ward
sufficient
notice
that
he
could
be
constitutionally
charged
and
convicted
of
the
offences
that
were
contained
in
his
indictment.
thank
you
very
much
your
honors.
