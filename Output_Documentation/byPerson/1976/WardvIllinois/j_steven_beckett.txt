mr.
j.
steven
beckett
mr.
chief
justice
it
may
please
the
court.
this
case
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
affirming
the
defendant?s
conviction
after
a
bench
trial
under
the
illinois
obscenity
statute.
the
defendant
was
tried
in
march
1972
and
he
was
charged
under
a
complaint
by
a
police
officer
with
offering
to
sell
and
selling
two
allegedly
obscene
magazines,
bizarre
world
and
illustrated
case
histories.
his
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
illinois
appellate
court
for
the
third
district
and
the
case
was
then
appealed
by
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
to
the
illinois
supreme
court.
that
court
considered
the
case
after
it
had
considered
a
case
called
people
versus
ridens
or
ridens
ii
which
was
the
case
on
the
remand
from
this
court
in
1973
which
was
decided
at
the
same
time
with
miller
versus
california.
in
ridens
ii
the
illinois
supreme
court
on
the
remand
held
that
the
illinois
obscenity
statute
was
still
constitutional
even
in
light
of
this
court?s
decision
in
miller
versus
california.
the
defendant
attacked
the
validity
of
the
illinois
obscenity
statute
under
principal
analysis
of
miller
v
california
and
that
attack
was
rejected
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
an
opinion
below.
the
court
also
held
that
the
publications
at
issue
in
this
case
were
not
protected
under
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
while
this
case
was
pending
in
the
illinois
supreme
court,
a
three-judge
federal
court
was
convened
in
chicago
to
consider
the
identical
argument
concerning
the
constitutionality
of
the
illinois
obscenity
statute.
on
may
14
the
illinois
supreme
court
announced
its
decision
in
people
versus
ward
below.
on
may
28
after
having
the
opportunity
to
review
the
opinion
of
people
versus
ward
that
three-judge
federal
court
held
the
illinois
obscenity
statue
unconstitutional
and
entered
a
permanent
injunction
against
its
enforcement
in
a
case
entitled
the
eagle
books,
inc.
versus
reinhard.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
the
illinois
legislature
enacted
law
that
was
vetoed.
that
would
have
changed
the
definition
of
obscenity
under
miller,
but
that
law
was
vetoed
so
the
practical
affect
is
there
has
been
no
change
in
illinois.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
there
in
fact
has
been
no
change.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
this
court
in
miller
and
also
in
footnote
6
in
miller
and
also
in
united
states
versus

200-ft.
reels
of
film,
indicated
that
existing
obscenity
laws
as
construed
hereto
or
hereafter
may
well
be
valid
and
in
hamling,
the
court
said
that
statement
meant
that
we
were
not
saying
that
all
obscenity
laws
were
unconstitutional,
but
in
announcing
miller
this
court
said
that
state
courts
on
the
remand
must
authoritatively
construe
those
statutes.
as
demonstrated
in
our
briefs
many
states
have
done
so
and
as
such
as
have
held
their
statutes
constitutional.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
construed
is
statute,
but
in
such
a
way
as
to
not
need
the
courts
remand
order
in
miller.
in
ridens,
the
court
said
that
in
response
to
the
specificity
attack
that
the
statute
as
written
because
it
finds
prurient
interest
as
a
shameful
or
morbid
interest
in
nudity,
sex
or
excretion
provides
the
specificity
that
this
court
has
required
under
miller,
under
part
(b).
that
question
was
addressed
by
the
three-judge
court
and
they
rejected
the
state
of
illinois?
contention
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
fact
and
grafted
on
to
its
statute,
the
examples
of
sexual
conduct
under
part
(b)
that
this
court
set
forth
in
the
miller
opinion.
additionally
that
court
noted
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
not
rely
on
prior
judicial
opinions
as
so
many
other
states
have
done.
in
other
words,
this
court
did
not
say
in
miller
what
an
authoritative
construction
was,
but
appellant
submits
to
the
court
that
an
authoritative
construction
is
fixing
words
in
the
statute
just
as
if
the
legislature
had
amended
it,
but
in
this
situation,
based
on
prior
decisions,
which
had
given
a
limiting
affect
to
the
statute
and
in
illinois
that
is
not
the
case.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
in
nscap
the
california
appellate
court
indicated
that
our
past
decisions
and
they
specifically
listed
past
decisions
and
said
that
our
past
decisions
under
section
311
of
the
california
penal
code
had
limited.
the
application
of
our
statute
to
hardcore
sexual
conduct
and
that
nudity
is
not
proscribed
and
some
other
rather
definite
statements.
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
never
done
this.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
i
definitely
disagree
with
that.
moreover
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
not
accept
that
argument.
i
think
the
specific
decision
that
i
think
he
is
referring
to
is
city
of
chicago
versus
geraci
and
that
court?s
decision
there
has
to
be
analogized
to
this
court?s
decision
in
united
states
versus
hamling.
this
court
said
our
past
decisions
in
considering
constitutional
attacks
on
federal
obscenity
statute
and
in
interpreting
those
statutes
have
given
them
a
limited
affect.
a
limiting
affect
that
we
have
been
really
codified
in
miller
with
those
examples
and
so
we
have
no
difficulty
in
grafting
examples
(a)
and
(b)
on
to
those
federal
obscenity
statutes
and
we
said
we
are
going
to
do
so
in
united
states
versus
12
200
ft.
reels
of
film.
however,
the
illinois
case,
the
city
of
chicago
versus
geraci
was
not
interpreting
the
illinois
obscenity
statute.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
interpreting
an
ordinance
of
the
city
of
chicago
and
second
the
discussion
that
mentioned
the
specific
sexual
conduct
in
that
opinion
was
not
talking
about
interpretation
of
the
term
obscenity
or
any
derivative
thereof,
it
was
talking
about
the
constitutional
status
of
the
publications.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
no.
the
geraci
case
in
fact
demonstrates
the
problems
that
people
such
as
the
appellant
ward
and
those
in
illinois
have
in
this
situation.
the
status
of
the
law
in
1971
with
respect
to
obscenity
as
the
court
is
well
aware
is
what
justice
brennan
has
called
hopeless
confusion.
in
this
specific
geraci
case,
the
illinois
supreme
court
took
categories
of
publications
and
said
for
example
that
the
united
state
supreme
court
and
central
magazine
sales
has
looked
at
publications
similar
to
these
and
they
depict
bondage
etcetera
and
that
court
said
that
no
matter
what
test
you
apply
to
obscenity
those
publications
are
entitled
to
constitutional
protection,
and
therefore,
the
categories
of
magazines
that
we
have
here
are
protected
under
the
first
amendment,
and
the
court
went
on
to
consider
a
magazine,
the
depictions
of
which
are
mentioned
in
the
state
of
illinois
brief
and
said
well
we
cannot
find
any
cases
that
are
exactly
on
this,
but
united
states
supreme
court
has
looked
at
sado-masochistic
materials
in
mishkin
and
affirmed
convictions
under
that,
but
under
avansino
versus
new
york
and
shepherd
versus
new
york
and
friedman
versus
new
york,
the
untied
states
supreme
court
has
reversed
convictions
under
redrupp
(ph)
type
decisions.
and
then
they
go
on
to
say
well
however
you
can
interpret
those
cases,
we
are
going
to
say
that
these
magazines
appeal
to
prurient
interest
etcetera
and
that
they
are
obscene,
that
they
are
not
constitutionally
protected,
rejecting
the
defendants
contention.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
i
think
i
content
both.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
it
was
in
1970.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
pre-miller,
it
was
prior
to
date
of
the
dissemination
of
the
materials
that
alleged
there
is
an
alleged
view
crime
in
this
case.
the
question
under
miller
is
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
said
a
question
of
notice,
a
question
of
notice
to
the
defendant,
appellant
ward,
and
to
those
similarly
situated
in
illinois.
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief,
decisions
of
state
courts,
after
this
court?s
decision
in
miller
demonstrate
that
those
courts
have
taken
a
look
at
their
statute
as
written,
have
taken
a
look
at
their
previous
judicial
interpretations
and
constructions
of
those
statutes
and
determined
one
of
three
things.
they
have
determined
that
their
past
decisions
have
limited
the
scope
of
that
statute
and
that
there
was
fair
warning
to
the
defendant,
the
statute
is
constitutional,
his
conviction
is
affirmed.
they
have
determined
that
their
prior
decisions
did
not
provide
a
limiting
effect
on
the
statute,
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
this
defendant
to
apply
what
they
are
now
going
to
construe
into
the
statute
under
miller,
and
therefore,
they
would
construe
the
statute
to
confirm
with
miller,
but
they
would
give
it
prospective
effect
only.
finally
some
states
have
looked
to
their
past
decisions,
found
no
limiting
construction
and
held
that
to
change
the
statute
now
would
be
a
form
of
legislation,
our
statute
is
unconstitutional.
illinois,
i
submit
has
done
none
of
the
above.
the
state
of
illinois
contends
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
incorporated
this
court?s
miller
examples
parts
a
and
b
in
its
decision
in
ridens
ii,
people
versus
gould.
the
state
then
contends
that
the
opinion
below
is
of
no
movement
because
the
court
had
already
included
the
a
and
b
examples.
the
opinion
below,
however,
demonstrates
fully
and
finally
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
not
done
so.
in
the
opinion,
which
is
the
portion,
which
i
am
referring
to,
which
appears
at
page
30
of
my
brief,
the
court
reviewed
the
history
of
the
ridens?
case.
the
court
noted
that
the
defendant
was
claiming
that
the
statute
did
not
provide
specificity
and
that
the
specificity
had
not
been
supplied
and
the
court
stated
that
in
ridens,
we
noted
that
the
statutory
definition
of
obscenity
includes
within
the
scope
for
prurient
interest,
a
shameful
or
morbid
interest
in
nudity,
sex
or
excretion.
in
answer
to
the
defendant?s
contention
that
was
not
enough
that
miller
required
specificity.
the
court?s
concluded
by
saying
we
again
express
our
opinion
that
the
illinois
statutory
definition
is
sufficiently
clear
to
withstand
constitutional
objection.
the
statutory
definition
i
submit
has
no
specificity.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
construction
placed
upon
the
statute
in
response
to
the
remand
order
in
miller
allows
nudity
to
be
proscribed
in
illinois.
the
characterization
is
nudity,
sex
or
excretion.
this
court?s
holding
in
jenkins
of
course
says
nudity
is
not
enough
under
those
miller
standards.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
three-judge
court's
interpretation
of
illinois
law
is
persuasive
on
this
court
under
gooding
versus
wilson
and
that
court
has
completely
accepted
our
contention
as
to
what
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
done.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
i
think
if
mr.
justice
rehnquist
would
look
at
the
opinions
of
the
illinois
supreme
court,
you
would
see
that
they
have
missed
the
thrust
of
your
opinion
in
miller.
they
have
said
that
an
obscenity
statute
is
a
general
term
statute
not
unlike
an
anti-noise
ordinance
that
was
considered
by
this
court
in
grayned
versus
city
of
rockford,
or
like
disorderly
conduct
ordinance.
their
decision
is
not
based
upon
obscenity
cases,
it
is
based
on
general
term
statute.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
both
of
them
and
i
think
the
three-judge
court
gave
of
course
in
my
client?s
view
a
more
objective
review
of
what
the
illinois
supreme
court
have
done.
three
times
now
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
been
asked
to
correct
their
misconceptions
about
miller
and
they
have
always
said
while
we
think
we
know
what
we
are
doing
and
we
are
doing
it
this
way
and
it
is
what
that
court
has
done
that
i
believe
i
am
asking
the
court
to
accept
today.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
and
said
that
statue
is?
that
is
correct
and
that
is
what
i
am
saying.
in
other
words,
i
think
what
the
attorney
general
in
this
case
is
asking
you
to
do
is
what
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
not
do.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
yes,
i
think
they
do
believe.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
because
they
have
not
followed
miller.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
i
wish
i
knew.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
because
the
opinion
below
and
the
other
opinion
show
that
they
feel
specificity
is
on
the
statute
as
written.
nudity,
sex
or
excretion
and
i
do
not
believe
that
is
what
miller
said.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
i
think
it
has
to
be
a
little
more
specific.
if
you
look
at
the
decisions
of
the
other
states
they
were
not
that
casual
about
their
approach.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
that
is
correct,
but
where
the
attempt
to
construe
a
statute
in
accordance
with
miller
is
including
nudity
then
not
only
have
they
misconceived
the
thrust
of
miller,
but
they
have
also
gone
beyond
this
court?s
holing
in
jenkins.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
that
is
correct.
first
amendment
standard
the
court
said
and
it
is
appellant?s
position
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
not
met
those
standards.
the
illinois
supreme
court
had
a
further
opportunity
to
look
at
this
problem,
this
conflict
after
the
three-judge
court
rendered
its
decision
in
a
petition
for
rehearing
and
denied
that
petition
for
rehearing
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
that
is
correct.
it
is
not
unlike
lewis
versus
new
orleans
where
a
remand
order
of
this
court
to?
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
remand
order
of
the
court;
that
is
correct.
remand
order
of
the
court
was
not
followed
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court
and
the
case
came
back
up
here
and
you
said
that
the
matter
is
not
what
the
conduct
was
that
was
involved
here,
but
i
do
think
that
the
materials
here
are
illustrative
of
the
problem
in
illinois
of
no
guidelines.
those
materials
are
not
unlike
materials
that
this
court
in
redrupp
type
cases
held
protected
under
whatever
test
of
obscenity
you
apply
is
very
high
to
get
any
dimes
of
course
from
those
redrupp
cases,
but
in
marks
recently
you
said
that
when
a
fragmented
court
decides
a
case
we
should
look
to
the
narrowest
ground.
i
submit
in
those
cases
the
narrowest
ground
was
that
those
materials,
those
specific
materials
were
constitutionally
protected.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
i
do
not
think
there
was
a
doctrine
in
redrupp
case.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
well,
he
is
complaining
of
a
pre-miller
conviction
by
saying
now
the
illinois
obscenity
statute
has
never
given
notice
and
this
court
recognized
that
problem
in
miller
and
said
that
a
statute
much
be
written
or
construed
authoritatively
to
satisfy
those
notice
problems.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
march,
1972.
the
prior
decisions
of
illinois
supreme
court
are
as
i
said
unlike
hamling.
the
court's
consideration
of
roth,
ginsberg,
manual
enterprises
versus
day,
because
those
decisions
are
concerned
in
ad
hoc
determination
of
the
materials
at
issue
in
those
cases,
and
do
not
involve
interpretation
or
construction
of
illinois
obscenity
statute.
indeed
at
least
one
half
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
state
in
their
brief
are
cases
decided
by
illinois
appellate
courts
after
the
defendant
ward
was
arrested
and
it
is
hard
to
see
how
they
would
supply
the
type
of
notice
that
the
state
contends
that
they
do
about
his
dissemination
of
material
after
he
was
arrested.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
yes.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
that
is
correct.
in
ridens,
i
think
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
the
opinion
indicated
that
it
knew
under
miller,
it
was
supposed
to
look
to
its
prior
decisions
and
that
it
did
so
and
concluded
from
those
prior
decisions
that
there
was
no
limiting
affect
of
those
decisions
on
the
statute
because
in
the
case
they
used
the
phrase
authority,
we
must
authoritatively
construe,
and
then
they
said
the
first
question
we
want
to
answer
is
what
community
standard
we
are
going
to
use
under
our
obscenity
guidelines
and
they
said
in
people
versus
pautler
which
was
decided
before
miller
and
before
ridens,
we
set
a
state
wide
standard
and
so
we
are
going
to
adhere
of
that
again
today,
but
at
the
same
time
they
did
not
say
that
our
prior
decisions
have
limited
the
effect
of
our
statute
under
the
miller
and
indeed
justice
davis,
who
had
written
the
first
ridens
decision
in
dissent,
pointed
out
that
those
prior
decisions
do
not
have
that
affect.
the
whole
purpose
i
think
of
properly
drawn
obscenity
statute
written
or
traditionally
construed
is
that
people
such
as
my
client
can
take
the
statute
and
compare
it
with
the
materials
that
they
have
and
they
can
say
page
43,
page
27,
page
85,
page
64,
etc.,
well,
there
is
a
type
of
portrayal
there
that
may
render
this
patently
offensive
and
i
am
going
to
have
to
make
by
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
i
can
disseminate
this
material
with
or
without
the
risk
of
prosecution.
in
the
sense
then
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
conflicted
with
decisions
of
this
court
because
they
say
nudity
is
enough
and
if
that
is
true
of
course
anything
that
is
available
on
the
market
today
of
the
playboy
type
magazine
would
be
held
obscene
or
could
be
held
obscene
in
illinois.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
the
opinion
below
and
also
in
the
ridens
opinion
said
that
we
complained
that
statute
was
not
specific
enough;
however,
we
note
that
prurient
interest
is
defined
as
nudity,
sex
or
excretion.
that
is
that
quote
that
i
told
you
on
page
13
of
our
brief.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
a
shameful
or
morbid
interest
in
nudity,
sex
or
excretion.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
it
is
adding
shameful
or
morbid
onto
nudity?
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
shameful
or
morbid
nudity
is
enough.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
and
the
point
is
by
saying
that
have
you
said
has
the
statute
defined
sexual
conduct,
has
the
statute
defined
sexual
conduct
as
you
said
it
must
to
know
it.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
just
a
couple
of
remarks,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
assume
for
the
moment
because
it
is
true
that
mr.
ward
did
consult
a
counsel
back
in
1971
or
prior
there
too
and
the
status
of
illinois
law
was
just
like
the
status
of
obscenity
law
throughout
the
nation,
hopeless
confusion,
as
emphasized,
i
think
in
that
geraci
opinion
where
the
court
said
we
really
do
not
understand
why
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
said
material
like
this
is
constitutionally
protected,
but
we
are
going
to
say
it
is
not
constitutionally
protected
and
i
submit
that
in
that
situation
we
are
very
hard
pressed
to
say
that
these
particular
materials
which
are
not
hardcore
materials.
they
are
not
the
type
of
materials
that
this
court
described
in
hamling
versus
united
states.
you
do
not
have
explicit
sexual
activity
in
the
one
magazine
illustrated
case
histories
there,
there
may
be
suggestions
of
sexual
activity,
but
in
the
other
one
there
are
no
suggestions
of
sexual
activity.
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
an
affect
in
ridens,
in
gould,
in
ward,
reenacted
the
illinois
obscenity
statute
and
they
have
done
so
not
by
in
grafting
any
examples
of
obscenity
or
any
specificity.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
to
allow
a
conviction
for
one
constitutionally
protected
magazine
to
stand.
in
this
situation
the
state
can
certainly
charge
obscenity
in
two
separate
accounts.
so
you
have
got
the
effect
of
a
general
verdict
without
knowing
which
magazine
the
judge
relied
on
if
at
all.
in
other
words,
the
judge
may
have
looked
at
illustrated
case
histories
and
determined
it
is
obscene,
but
the
other
one
was
and
still
convicted
and
now
we
get
up
to
the
united
stated
supreme
court,
and
they
say,
well,
that
judge
was
wrong,
the
other
one
is
obscene.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
yes,
it
was
a
bench
trial.
the
other
one
is
obscene
and
the
other
one
is
constitutionally
protected.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
oh,
there
that
was
not.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
no
i
do
not.
i
think
certainly
under
i
believe
under
the
first
amendment,
i
do
not
think
we
should
be
allowed
to
be
and
remain
convicted
if
one
magazine
is
not
obscene.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
yeah.
part
b
of
miller
does
not
require
a
state
to
give
examples.
part
b
of
miller
requires
a
state
to
give
specificity.
if
you
have
the
1%
that
mr.
justice
stevens
was
talking
about,
that
material
may
not
be
prosecutable.
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
i
think
that
if
you
agree
with
me
then
you
would
say
that
that
statute
in
the
cases
have
never?
mr.
j.
steven
beckett
oh,
the
obscenity
