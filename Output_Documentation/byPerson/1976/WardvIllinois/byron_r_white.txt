the
other
case
i
have,
the
--
the
ward
case
comes
here
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
illinois.
that
state
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
obscenity
law
against
claims
that
the
law
did
not
comply
with
the
requirements
of
this
court's
decision
several
years
ago
in
miller
against
california.
we
granted
--
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
because
--
because
the
--
the
decision
was
in
conflict
with
a
decision
of
the
federal
three-judge
court
which
had
invalidated
the
statutes.
we
affirmed,
we
agree
with
the
illinois
supreme
court
that
the
statute
is
consistent
with
miller.
we
don't
think
it's
either
vague
or
overbroad,
so
we
do
affirmed
with
the
judgment.
