unknown
speaker
i
suppose
not
every
state
needs
to
change
its
statute
because
of
miller,
is
that
true?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
think
your
case
is
different
from
people
against
nscap
(ph)
where
the
california
courts
treated
their
obscenity
statute.
unknown
speaker
but
your
opposing
counsel
at
least
contents
that
in
earlier
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
similar
limitations
were
placed
on
the
illinois
statute,
you
disagree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
your
contention
that
either
the
opinion
in
the
question
or
the
text
of
the
statute
itself
must
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest?
unknown
speaker
do
would
you
contend
that
the
material
sold
by
your
client
here
that
the
statute
gave
no
fair
warning
that,
that
was
included
or
do
you
contend
that
the
statute
was
required
to
have
specific
enumerations
or
else
decisions
to
have
it,
instead
whether
your
client?s
material
was
warned
about
as
a
material
or
do
you
contend
both?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
date
of
the
geraci
decision
of,
if
i
have
the
name
right?
unknown
speaker
pre-miller?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
the
illinois
supreme
court
believes
that
it
is
acting
consistently
with
miller,
it
seems
to?
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
read
miller,
you
require
that
a
state
will
follow
or
include
in
its
laws
the
specifics
of
pattern,
that
offensiveness,
the
?
if
that
is
the
way
you
read
miller
it
is
so
plain,
i
would
think
it
would
be
plain
to
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
if
its
intention
is
to
follow
miller,
why
do
you
not
except
that.
unknown
speaker
why
have
they
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
know
they
have
not?
unknown
speaker
i
know
that,
they
agreed
that
they
are
purporting
at
least
to
adhere
to
pattern
offensiveness
standard
in
miller.
unknown
speaker
and
all
miller
did
was
say,
it
went
on
to
give
some
examples
of
pattern
offensiveness.
unknown
speaker
so
if
the
supreme
court
have
said
that,
if
illinois
had
said
we
agree
what
the
patent
offensiveness
in
the
standard
as
explained
by
the
supreme
court
of
united
states,
would
you
except
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
may
not
have
been,
but
they
are
different
styles,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
we
said
in
hamling
that
miller
was
not
intended
as
a
drafting
manual;
that
you
did
not
have
to
simply
repeat
word
for
word
the
type
of
thing
that
was
set
out
at
miller.
unknown
speaker
did
not
the
miller
opinion
state
correctly
that
the
court
was
neither
confident
to
nor
it
is
judicially
confident
in
terms
of
power
or
undertaking
to
draft
a
statute
or
tell
the
states
how
to
draft
a
statute,
but
to
merely
furnish
some
broad
guidelines
that
would
indicate
the
boundaries
within,
which
states
must
act.
unknown
speaker
and
your
position
in
this
regard
really
does
not
depend
on
whether
the
materials
at
issue
here
are
protected
under
the
miller
standard
or
not?
unknown
speaker
this
over
statue
and
this
would
be
an
over
breadth.
unknown
speaker
but
miller
succeeded
whatever
doctrine
may
have
evolved
in
the
redrupp.
unknown
speaker
your
client
is
not
complaining
of
a
pre-miller
conviction?
unknown
speaker
when
was
your
client
tried?
unknown
speaker
do
you
see
any
difference
between
notice
and
over
breadth?
unknown
speaker
is
not
over
breadth
curable
by
a
post
transaction
court
decision
whereas
the
prior
notice
requirement
is
not?
unknown
speaker
you
say
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
expressly
said
nudity
is
enough?
unknown
speaker
it
involved
a
morbid
or
shameful?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
quite
saying
nudity
is
enough,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
do
not
say
nudity
is
enough
there.
unknown
speaker
shameful
or
morbid
interest
and
nudity.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
the
question.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
you
to
say
that
illinois
supreme
court
said
that
what
we
decided
before
miller
will
not
change
by
miller?
unknown
speaker
but
they
did
not
spell
it
out
though?
unknown
speaker
but
the
legislature
thought
so?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
did
pass
an
act?
unknown
speaker
19
of
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
did
the
three-judge
district
court
discussed
people
against
sikora?
unknown
speaker
i
have
two
questions
if
i
may.
is
the
part
of
the
sikora
decision
that
you
think
is
applicable
here,
the
reference
to
sadism
and
masochism?
unknown
speaker
you
think
those
terms
are
perfectly
clear
and
specific
as
to
what
they
cover?
i
got
some
uncertainly
as
to
just
the
exact
meaning
of
those
terms
myself.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
more
specific
example
than
erratic
material
appealing
to
prurient
interest
or
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
my
second
question
is
that
assume
a
state
statute
says
or
a
state
legislature
says
our
statute
shall
prohibit
everything
in
the
examples
given
in
miller,
the
a
and
b
examples
and
also
sadism
and
masochism
gives
four
or
five
other
specific
concrete
examples
and
then
says
and
in
addition
anything,
which
is
patently
offensive
and
as
the
general
standards
of
miller,
it
has
the
general
category
and
then
a
list
of
specifics
as
examples
as
the
miller
opinion
itself
does,
would
that
satisfying
miller
in
your
judgment?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
all
you
need
is
some
example,
you
do
not
need
any
limitations.
unknown
speaker
well,
accepting,
what
is
the
purpose
then
of
the
specificity
requirement?
why
is
it
not
the
simple
general
language
sufficient
because
as
long
as
you
catch
all
general
pickup
clause,
what
more
you
need?
unknown
speaker
then
i
ask,
if
there
were
two
publications
involved
here?
unknown
speaker
were
they
both
in
one
count
in
information
or??
unknown
speaker
and
your
contention
is
that
both
of
them,
each
of
them
satisfies
the
miller
standards?
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
we
disagree
with
you
on
one
of
them?
unknown
speaker
and
why
is
that?
unknown
speaker
does
the
illinois
law,
suppose
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
had
decided
that
one
of
these
publications
was
not
obscene,
would
the
illinois
law
have
called
for
affirmance
nevertheless.
unknown
speaker
under
which
one
of
the
specifics
given
in
miller
do
these
publications
fall
under?
unknown
speaker
so,
if
the
court
believes
that
those
--
that
the
specific
examples
in
miller
limited
the
category
of
patent
offensiveness
to
those
kinds
of
things,
then
you
are
in
trouble?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean
to
which?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
harding
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
melbourne
a.
noel,
jr.,
could
i
follow
up
on
the
questions
i
asked
before.
as
i
understand
your
argument,
you
say
that
the
examples
given
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
prior
cases
as
well
as
adoption
of
the
miller
examples,
include
about
99%
of
those
within
the
general
category,
there
is
only
may
be
about
1%
in
the
catch
of
all?
unknown
speaker
but
let
us
assume
for
purpose
of
discussion,
the
1%
has
not
specifically
defined
that
would
be
then
the
general
description
and
as
i
understand
that
illinois
supreme
court
has
never
said
there
may
not
be
a
prosecution
for
the
1%,
there
may
be
prosecutions
for
these
99%
examples?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
they
have
done
is
given
us
99%
in
specific
examples
and
they
have
given
us
some,
there
are
not
the
100%.
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
still
a
1%
that
is
potentially
subject
to
prosecution
under
the
general
definition
because
the
illinois
has
never
said,
we
have
listed
these
and
this
is
all
that
can
be
subject
to
prosecution.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
a
legislature
for
example
gave
a
list
and
said
this
is
all
there
is,
that
would
be
--
unknown
speaker
but
it
would
nevertheless
be
prosecuted?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
read
then
page
27
of
the
miller
opinion,
the
sentence,
under
the
holdings
announced
today,
no
one
will
be
subject
to
prosecution
for
the
sale
or
exposure
materials
unless
these
materials
and
so
forth
depict
offensive
hardcore
sexual
conduct,
specifically
defined
by
the
regulating
state
law
as
written
or
construed.
as
i
understand
what
you
are
saying
is
1%
may
be
prosecuted,
but
not,
no
one.
unknown
speaker
the
99%
the
case.
unknown
speaker
but
then
how
do
you,
the
words
no
one
apparently
were
not
used
to
say
the
court
did
not
mean
what
it
said.
unknown
speaker
and
therefore,
the
ultimate
test
is
the
general
tripartite
standard
and
the
requirement
of
specificity
merely
is
--
the
only
needs
a
group
of
illustration.
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
correct
though
that
some
of
the
other
states
have
in
affect
said
the
only
things
which
may
be
subject
to
prosecution
are
those
identified
specifically?
unknown
speaker
it
is
it
not
there
this
difference
between
illinois
and
these
other
states.
they
have
at
least
said
the
statute
is
limited
to
certain
examples.
illinois
has
never
said
that.
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
that
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
continued
to
construe
the
statute
to
reach
materials
that
were
utterly
without
(voice
overlap).
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
that
the
court
should
do
if
it
disagreed
with
you
on
everything
except
on
the
issue
of
the
obscenity
of
warrant
of
these?
unknown
speaker
was
is
a
bench
trial?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
request
made
for
the
equivalent
of
a
special
verdict?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
would
have
think
you
are
standing,
you
raise
that
issue
is
unimpaired
at
this
stage?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
yes
i
do.
i
mean,
no
i
do
not.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
the
most
that
will
happen,
even
if
we
agreed
with
you
on
that
one,
would
that
we
would
remand,
vacate
the
judgment
and
remand
for
re-sentencing
or
possible
re-sentencing?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
even
if
we
disagreed
with
you
on
everything
except
the?
unknown
speaker
of
one
magazine
then
the
most
we
would
do,
even
if
we
agreed
with
you
on
that
point
would
be
the
remand
for
re-sentencing
vacate,
we
would
not
satisfy
then,
we
would
not
say
that
the
conviction
could
stand
entirely?
