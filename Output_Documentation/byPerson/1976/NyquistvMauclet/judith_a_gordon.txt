mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
new
york
offers
grants
and
subsidized
loans
to
undergraduate
and
graduate
students
among
its
higher
education
assistance
programs.
only
grants
are
directly
in
issue
on
this
appeal,
particularly
region's
college
scholarships
which
are
awarded
competitively
on
the
basis
of
performance
on
an
examination
and
to
tuition
assistance
awards
known
as
tap
which
are
available
to
any
qualified
student.
the
question
presented
is
whether
new
york
may,
consistently
with
the
equal
protection
clause
offer
these
grants
to
state
residents
who
are
citizens,
to
aliens
willing
to
become
citizens
and
to
certain
alien
refugees.
necessarily
excluding
other
aliens
including
aliens
like
appellees
here
in,
who
are
permanent
residents
who
had
refused
to
become
an
american
citizens.
the
mauclet
case
was
instituted
in
the
western
district
of
new
york
in
february
1975.
the
rabinovitch
action
was
instituted
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
in
august
of
1974.
both
cases
were
determined
by
a
three
judge
district
court
in
the
eastern
district
which
ended
in
a
judgment
from
which
this
appeal
is
taken.
now
appellee
mauclet
is
a
french
citizen
and
he
has
been
a
permanent
resident
alien
in
the
united
states
since
1969.
he
was
a
graduate
student
at
the
state
university
of
new
york
at
buffalo
at
the
time
the
judgment
below
was
entered
and
he
had
been
denied
a
tuition
assistance
award
as
a
graduate
student,
for
the
1974-1975
academic
year
on
the
basis
of
the
state
statute
involved
section
661
because
in
essence
he
refused
to
become
an
american
citizen.
appellee
rabinovitch
is
canadian,
he
has
been
a
permanent
resident
in
new
york
and
in
the
united
states
since
1964,
he
was
an
undergraduate
student
at
brooklyn
college
in
the
city
of
new
york
when
the
judgment
was
entered
and
he
was
not
a
regions
college
scholarship
for
the
same
academic
years
involved
in
the
mauclet
case
because
again
he
refused
to
apply
for
american
citizenship.
indeed
as
he
states
in
his
affidavit
filed
below,
he
has
no
intention
of
applying
for
american
citizenship.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes
your
honor,
we
do,
we
have
the
exact
real
figures
as
a
matter
of
fact.
the
direct
student
aid
program
which
is
involved,
and
with
specific
reference
to
regions
college
scholarships
and
to
tuition
assistance
is
$208
million
in
the
state
of
new
york
for
this
present
fiscal
period,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
your
honor,
frankly
i
can't
respond
on
that,
it's
not
is
that
we
did
not
try
to
get
the
statistics
but
because
we
have
a
program
which
has
foreclosed
some
aliens.
we
do
not
know
what
opening
that
program
would
mean
and
indeed
a
statistics
that
would
be
more
potentially
relevant
namely
an
age
category
of
permanent
resident
aliens
in
new
york
were
not
available
from
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
the
ones
that
were,
were
completely
unrealistic.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
oh,
i
am
sorry,
i
mean
what
would
be
the
difference
in
cost?
unfortunately,
your
honor
we
cannot
project
that.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that's
correct
your
honor.
we
may
not
be
speaking
about
very
much
however
this,
given
the
quality
of
this
scholarship
program
as
a
selection
program
it
does
have
an
extension
in
terms
of
other
scholarships
which
are
necessarily
equally
selection
programs
and
then
they
have
involving
much
greater
public
cost.
now
region
scholarships
share.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
exactly
your
honor?
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
of
course
your
honor,
it's
the
basis
of
any
selection
program
that
involves
a
public
benefit
is
of
course,
ultimately
a
finite
resource
and
of
course
the
question
then
becomes,
who
has
the
better
demand
on
that
resource,
the
people
who
are
included
or
all
people
who
are
now
excluded.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
is
exactly
right
your
honor,
the
region
scholarships
and
the
tap
awards
are
pure
grants-in-aids,
they
are
gifts.
now,
a
separate
issue
is
in
fact
raised
in
this
case
with
respect
to
student
loans
which
by
definition
are
repayable.
now,
the
statute,
the
state
statute,
in
issue
section
661
covers
student
loans
and
appellee
rabinovitch
has
attempted
to
place
the
regulation
of
that
statute,
these
are
the
student
loans
in
issue
in
this
case.
we
contested
his
standing
to
do
that
below
and
the
issue
was
determined
against
us,
we
have
re-raised
it
on
this
appeal
and
it
raises
some
very
significant
questions,
however
i
think
it's
sufficient
at
this
point
to
point
out
to
you,
that
to
the
extent
that
loans
are
in
fact
subsidized
by
public
money,
they
are
to
that
extent
gifts
and
can
be
fairly
analogized
to
the
grant
program.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that's
exactly
right
your
honor
and
it's
our
position
on
this
appeal
even
putting
aside
the
standing
question,
that
remand
would
need
to
be
had
on
the
loan
issue
to
raise
indeed
the
issue
just
mentioned
namely
whether
there
was
a
basis
to
infer
that
there
was
this
additional
rationale
that
the
alien
unwilling
to
become
a
citizen
would
be
more
likely
to
leave
the
jurisdiction
and
not
return
than
the
alien
who
is
willing
to
become
a
citizen,
we
do
seek
remand
or
we
believe
that
unless
661
can
be
sustained
under
the
equal
protection
clause
but
to
invalidate
the
statute
would
be
quite
because
we
would
want
to
raise
that
additional
issue
including
some
other
additional
issues
that
pertain
specifically
to
loans
because
they
are
partially
federally
subsidized.
the
grants-in-aid,
the
tap
awards
and
the
regions
college
scholarships
are
not
in
fact
in
any
way
federally
subsidized,
they
are
completely
state?
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
absolutely,
that's
exactly
the
problem
or
the
question
you
pose,
is
exactly
the
problem
that
arises
when
any
program
that
was
formally
closed
is
now
open
and
we
tend
to
calculate
what
would
happen.
now,
obviously,
if
any
alien
knew
that
by
his
mere
presence
in
the
state,
either
as
an
immigrant
or
possibly
as
a
non-immigrant,
he
could
get
aid
to
education,
well,
presumably
he
would
want
to
come
here.
now
if...
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
do
i
think
the
government
is
paralytic
to
keep
the
aliens
from
coming?
you
mean
the
state
government
or
the
federal
government.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
of
course
not
your
honor,
of
course
not.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
well,
i
don't
how
whether
they
could
stop
me
from
whether
or
would
it
even
be
realistic
to
assume
your
honor
that
they
could
stop
him
from
settling
in
new
york
state,
once
they
were
admitted
to
the
united
sates,
however
i
should
point.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
there
is
a
durational
residence
requirement
for
tap
awards
and
for
college
scholarships,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
well,
i
think
there
would
be
different
at
least
to
this
extent
your
honor,
california
the
example,
you
took
happens
to
have
one
of
the
most
major
public
university
systems
in
the
united
states
and
probably
has
a
durational
residence
requirement
incident
to
a
system
which
could
be
met
by
an
individual
going
from
new
york
within
a
fairly
brief
period
of
time
to
california.
now
the
same,
the
same
principle,
i
don't
think?
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
i
believe
so
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
pardon
me
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yeah,
well,
i
think
it's
obvious
your
honor,
that
new
york,
california
and
indeed
there
are
many
states
in
the
union
which
offer
enhanced
benefit
programs
and
possibly
for
that
reason
have
been
a
population
centers
in
the
united
states
within,
in
other
words,
they
have
attracted
people
to
the
united
states,
certainly
that
was
too
historically
in
terms
of
the
north
being
more
attracted
to
some
individuals
than
the
south.
however,
i
think
there
are
couple
of
points
that
need
to
be
emphasized.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
canada
for
example,
canada
states
very
plainly
in
its
information
offered
through
its
consulate
that
it
provides
no
grants-in-aid
of
any
kind
to
undergraduate
students.
now,
i
do
not
have
the
law
nor
although
i
do
have
its
booklet
now.
obviously,
appellee
rabinovitch
is
getting
in
the
united
states,
what
the
american
student
who
went
to
his
homeland
could
not
get
in
canada.
now
the
situation,
we
attempted
to
check
out
the
situation
with
france
your
honor,
but
the
information
was
frankly
not
available
to
us.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
your
honor,
the
statute
operates
in
terms
of
its
purposes
and
in
our
view,
in
a
very
close
nexus
with
the
type
of
classification
that's
involved.
now
we
have
indicated,
we
have
argued
and
we
believe
that
the
legislative
history
directly
supports
this,
that
the
statute
has
a
specific
purpose
in
enhancing
the
educational
level
of
the
individuals
in
new
york
state
who
are
willing
to
become
identified
with
that
state,
namely
those
individuals
who
undertake
the
responsibilities
of
citizenship.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
to
take
the
last
point
first,
no
your
honor.
first
of
all
the
influx
problem,
i
think
we
should
proceed
it
this
way.
the
statute,
the
classification
involved
does
ask
the
alien
to
declare
his
intent
to
become
a
citizen
or
to
apply
for
it,
that
is
some
evidence
of
his
willingness
to
stay
in
new
york.
the
interstate
resident
who
comes
into
new
york
to
live
and
needs
the
durational
residence
requirement
is
already
a
citizen
your
honor.
he
is
fully
eligible,
by
virtue
of
his
birth
and
naturalization
and
his
prior
place
of
abode
to
participate.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
the
point
is
that
once
the
citizen
satisfies
the
durational
residence
requirement,
he
is
able
to
participate
in
the
state
community
to
the
same
extent,
as
the
state
resident
who
is
already
here,
the
alien
cannot
accept
and
he
refuses
that
kind
of
responsibility,
until
the
point
in
time
when
he
becomes
naturalize?
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
he
cannot
vote,
he
cannot
be
an
office
holder,
he
cannot
be
a
jeweler,
he
cannot
be
a
policeman
and
indeed
with
respect
to?
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
i
am
sorry,
your
honor,
perkins
v.
smith
was
affirmed
by
this
court
and
that's
the
state
jury
case,
your
honor.
there
is
certainly
quite
plain
language
in
dougall
v.
sugarman,
in
other
opinions
of
this
court,
that
within
a
office
holding
categories,
the
state
may
indeed
use
citizenship
as
a
criteria
for
those
types
of
positions,
in
the
case,
i
believe,
you
mentioned
that's
before
you
now
for
disposition,
here
as
foley
v.
connelie,
which
in
the
southern
district
sustained
its
citizenship
limitation
for
police
officers.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
no,
your
honor,
i
am
glad
to
raise
because
that's
one
of
the
points
and
issue.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
the
difference,
first
of
all,
the
financial
difference
is
very
substantial.
the
direct
student
aid
budget,
a
portion
of
which
i
gave
you
before,
as
i
said,
was
$208
million.
one-and-a-quarter
billion
dollars
is
spent
by
the
state
of
new
york
sponsoring
its
state
public
university
and
in
providing
contributions
to
city
universities.
now,
the
whole
purpose
and
some
independent
colleges.
the
whole
purpose
of
that
program
is
to
provide
reduced
tuition
rates,
now
those
reduced
tuition
rates
are
available
to
aliens
with
very
minor
exceptions,
not
here
relevant
and
to
citizens
unlike
terms.
now,
as
you
indicated
your
honor,
there
is
a
difference,
why
should
new
york
then
say
with
respect
to
this
particular
limited
category
of
awards.
we
are
going
to
exclude
some
aliens,
i
think
the
answer
your
honor
must
be
that
this
is
a
limited
program,
seeking
a
limited
purpose
namely.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
from
reduced
tuition,
your
honor?
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
from
admission
to
new
york
state?
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
well,
your
honor
i
don't
obviously
the
question
is
not
clearly
presented
by
this
case,
i
would
think
certainly
that
an
exclusion
like
that
with
parallel
cases
like
graham
v.
richardson,
with
parallel
cases
like
sugarman
v.
dougall,
where
the
foreclosure
on
the
access
of
the
alien
to
a
substantial
program
which
is
very
meaningful
to
him,
would
indeed
probably
burden
his
access
or
burden
his
ability
to
enter
and
abide
in
the
united
states
inconsistently
with
the
truax
doctrine.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
your
honor,
that
issue
was
considered
in
a
recent
lower
court
case
and
held
that
all
aliens
could
not
be
classified
in
terms
of
--
as
non
residents
for
reduced
tuition
purposes
and
i
think
that
example
again,
that's
a
much
more
substantial
barrier?
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes
we
do
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
no,
no
your
honor
merely
to
be
a
resident
of
new
york
is
not
be
a
citizen.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
well,
a
citizen
of
new
york.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
no,
as
an
american,
as
a...
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes
you
are
your
honor,
he
become
a
citizen...
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
no
your
honor,
we
confine
our
loans
and
scholarship
programs
to
citizens
who
are
residents
of
the
state
for
a
particular
period
of
time
and
we
also
provide
the
loans
and
scholarships?
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
is
correct,
unless
you?
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
well,
exactly
except
that
the
program
is
somewhat
broader
than
that
and
so
far
as
the
alien
can
get
the
benefit
of
the
statute,
without
in
fact
becoming
a
citizen,
he
can
get
it
in
effect
if
he
has
a
certain
refugee
status
and
he
can
get
it
in
a
process
of
becoming
a
citizen,
that's
why
it's
somewhat?
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
exactly
yes,
if
he
cannot
presently
become
a
citizen,
he
is
allowed
to
declare
his
intent,
and
that
your
point
your
honor
distinguishes
this
case,
i
think
very
materially
from
prior
cases
that
we
have
had,
that
the
court
has
recently
reviewed,
in
two
ways,
first
of
all
the
classifications
in
graham
and
sugarman,
in
de
otero
were
in
fact
classifications
based
on
alienage
the
status
of
alienage.
now,
we
have
argued
that
this
not
such
a
classification
and
i
believe
it's
incumbent
upon
us
to
show
you
that
it
is
not
such
a
classification
either
in
logic
or
as
a
matter
of
reality.
it
is
not
such
a
classification
because
the
mere
offer
of
the
statement
alienage
under
this
statute,
gets
you
nowhere.
the
statute
inquires
alienage
and
something
else,
we
have
said
that
is
the
statement
by
the
alien
who
is
to
the
extent
that
he
is
willing
to
identify
with
what
we
believe
are
the
interests
served
by
the
statute
and
he
gets
the
money
in
reality,
he
gets
the
money
for
the
entire
duration
of
his
alien
status
assuming
he
makes
the
commitment
that
is
requested
by
the
statute.
the
statute
is
also
very
different
from
graham
and
these
other
cases,
in
this
respect,
in
graham
and
the
cases
noted.
the
alien
was
barred
from
access
to
as
we
noted
very
substantial
programs
by
governmental
bar.
the
foreclosure
was,
as
a
specific
result
of
the
governmental
action,
there
was
nothing
that
the
alien
could
do
to
get
the
benefit
of
that
program.
in
this
situation,
the
statute
places
its
decision
making
upon
the
alien,
he
may
or
may
not
wish
to
make
the
commitment
that
the
statute
offers
to
him,
but
if
he
in
fact
makes
it,
he
gets
the
benefit
of
the
program
immediately.
now,
as
i
indicated,
there
are
certain
specific
and
we
believe
substantial
interests
involved
in
the
program
and
they
are..
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes,
exactly
and
i
think
we
should
ask
what
the
consequence
of
that
type
of
system
is,
as
compared
to
the
consequence
of
denying
an
alien,
for
example,
welfare
benefits.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
those
can
fairly
be
said
i
believe
to
burden
his
right
to
enter
and
abide.
however,
if
we
give
some
group
of
individuals
simply
a
gift,
i
do
not
think
that
we
can
fairly
say
that
we
are
burdening
or
penalizing
the
individuals
who
do
not
receive
the
gift.
for
example,
i
do
not
think
that
the
in-state
limitation,
the
in-state
residence
limitation,
that
is
next
to
this
type
of
program.
a
residence
limitation
essentially
approved
by
this
court
in
vlandis
v.
kline
can
realistically
say
that
we
are
burdening
new
jersey
residents
who
do
not
get
the
benefit
of
this
program.
this
court
affirmed
the
opinion
of
spatt
v.
new
york
which
involves
specifically,
the
use
of
region
college
scholarship.
now
in
spatt,
the
individual
who
brought
the
claim
wanted
to
take
his
regions
college
scholarship
and
use
in
new
jersey,
now
we
don't
permit
that
the
college
scholarship
has
to
be
used
in
new
york
and
he
argued
that
it's
--
our
preclusion
of
this
use
of
that
scholarship
in
new
jersey
penalized
him
and
this
court
affirmed
a
decision
which
said
that
there
was
indeed
no
penalty
involved.
now
in
contrast
of
the
tuition
assistance
program,
i
indicated
to
you
previously
the
total
amount
of
money
that
was
involved
but
whereas
the
tuition
assistance
program,
in
our
view
potentially
involves
a
foreclosure
of
access,
the
program
here
involved
is
as
i
say,
limited
in
the
terms
of
gross
amount
involved
and
very
limited
in
terms
of
the
amount
of
benefits
that
any
individual
receives,
namely
under...
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
it
certainly
is
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
i
think,
i
do
not
think
that
the
issue
of
whether
you
could
bar
aliens
from
reduced
tuitions
has
been
finally
resolved.
as
i
indicated
to
you,
there
is
one
lower
court
opinion
on
point.
i
do
believe
that
the
issue
of
barring
an
individual
from
an
access
to
a
publicly
sponsored
education
when,
for
example,
in
california
the
state
system
is
the
pre-eminent
system
within
that
territory,
places
a
much
more
substantial
foreclosure
on
the
alien
than
denying
him
a
gift
and
here
as
i
was
about
to
indicate,
the
dimension
of
that
gift,
in
terms
of
a
region
scholarship
is
now
$250
annually.
the
dimension
of
the
tuition
assistance
award
is
between
$100
and
$1500
depending
on
the
income
level
of
the
individual,
however,
the
first
$200
of
such
awards
are
necessarily
exempt,
and
there
is
an
income
sealing
with
respect
to
the
eligibility
of
the
candidate
to
receive
the
award.
so
we
are
not
talking
about
in
the
legislative
history
certainly
does
not
purport
to
say,
but
this
is
a
program
which
is
intended
to
subsidize
the
complete
cost
of
education.
the
major
subsidy
comes
at
the
end
of
the
comes
in
the
reduced
tuition,
thank
you
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes
your
honor,
i
have
a
few
minutes.
the
future
progress
of
the
state
and
nation
and
the
general
welfare
of
the
people
depend
upon
the
individual
development
of
the
maximum
number
of
citizen
leaders
to
provide
a
broad
range
of
leadership.
it
is
in
the
vital
interest
of
the
people
of
the
state
to
develop
fully
this
reservoir
of
talent
and
future
leadership.
that
is
a
quotation
from
the
same
legislative
history
that
mr.
greenberg
quoted
a
few
moments
ago.
it
appears
in
part
of
pages
12
and
13
of
our
brief,
and
it
appears
in
the
main
volume
of
the
mckinney
in
the
pertinence
of
education
law
sections,
where
it
is
a
set
forth
in
full.
so
much
for
post
hoc
rationalisation
and
indeed
however,
if
the
state
were
to
infer
any
purpose
from
the
face
of
a
given
statute,
absent
any
prior
legislative
history,
there
would
be
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
that
inference
under
a
strict
scrutiny
standard
or
under
a
reasonable
relation
standard.
now,
the
citizenship
and
national
affinity
requirements
with
respect
to
real
programs
in
issue
have
a
57
year
history
in
the
state
of
new
york.
they
were
started
in
1920,
when
the
regions
with
respect
to
region
scholarships.
they
were
expanded
gradually
throughout
the
years
until
they
re-substantially
--
their
present
form
in
1962
and
indeed
as
you
can
you
see
the
programs
themselves
were
expanded.
a
loans
coming
shortly
after
region
scholarships
in
1957
and
scholar
incentive
awards
coming
shortly
after
that
in
1961.
now,
appellees
refer
you,
both
appellees
refer
you
to
a
figure
$10,000
in
50
students.
they
come
to
that
figure
by
starting
their
legislative
research
in
1961
with
the
birth
of
the
scholar
incentives
program,
putting
aside
the
40
years
of
customary
history
that
attached
to
the
region
scholarship
program.
now,
appellees'
say
and
there
is
a
difficulty
here
but
it
is
easily
resolved
at
the
birth
of
the
scholar
incentive
program
that
bill
was
in
the
same
package
of
bills,
that
occasionally
revisions
to
the
region
scholarship
program.
one
of
the
revisions
of
the
region
scholarship
program
was
a
reference
to
the
board
of
the
region
to
establish
an
appropriate
rule
regarding
citizenship
and
affinity
for
region
scholarship.
accordingly,
the
scholar
incentive
program,
as
i
indicated,
enacted
at
exactly
the
same
time,
didn't
have
a
rule
but
the
legislative
history
that
i
just
read
you,
was
enacted
with
respect
to
that
program.
appellants
have
submitted
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
legislature
at
that
point
to
have
the
regions
make
a
rule
for
both
programs.
appellee
mauclet
comes
in
and
he
says,
no,
impossible,
the
board
of
regions
didn't
have
the
power,
it
only
had
the
power
to
make
rules
with
respect
to
region
scholarships
not
with
respect
to
scholar
incentive.
the
answer
to
that
question
is
quite
simple,
the
power
is
found
in
section
603
of
the
education
law,
as
it
appears
in
the
main
volume
of
the
mckinney
which
was
in
fact
aided
to
include
border
regions
power
over
scholarship
incentives,
in
1961
when
that
program
was
created.
now,
the
$10,000,
as
it
turned
out,
over
the
period
of
time
when
scholar
incentives
were
first
enforced
and
this
reference
to
the
board
of
regions
was
enforced,
the
board
of
regions,
in
fact
made
a
rule
for
region
scholarships,
it
did
not
in
fact
make
a
rule
for
scholar
incentives.
as
a
result,
in
1969
the
legislature
in
essence
adopted
the
board
of
regions
rules
for
scholarships
and
codified
them
in
the
statutes
for
both
program.
now,
in
that
re-enactment,
in
effect
of
this
rule,
there
are
two
legislative
documents
that
the
appellees'
refer
to,
first
is
report
a)
which
started
at
the
beginning
apparently
the
beginning
of
1969
legislative
session,
it's
says
in
effect,
we
want
to
put
the
citizenship
requirement
back
and
there
is
an
indication
in
that
bill
that
the
savings
will
be
$10,000.
that
results
to
an
indication
in
that
bill
that
other
items
would
have
certain
savings
and
there
is
an
indication
in
every
new
york
state
bill
about
the
what
fiscal
ramifications
of
the
given
piece
of
legislation
are.
notably,
the
very
next
report
and
indeed
the
one
before,
the
legislature
apparently,
active
report
9,
deletes
the
reference
to
$10,000
in
50
students,
why
does
it
do
that?
i
think
because
it
was
obviously
gross
error.
the
question
of
where
this
$10,000
figure
came
from
is
never
explained
and
the
question
of
the
where
50
students
came
from
is
never
explained,
and
indeed
there
is
as
appellees'
themselves
indicate
in
this
immediately
following
report,
the
reference
was
itself
deleted.
accordingly,
i
don't
think
that
we
can
infer
anything
from
that,
what
we
can
infer
is
that
this
particular
--
that
section
661
in
its
present
form
is
a
matter
of
customary
history
in
the
state
of
new
york
over
a
very
substantial
period
of
time.
now,
i
would
just
like
to
take
a
few
moments
with
respect
to
point
raised
by
justice
rehnquist.
it
is
true
that
section
661(3)
now
regulates
three
programs.
it
is
equally
true
that
these
three
programs
are
separate
and
they
are
found
in
different
portions
of
the
statute
and
they
have
different
types
of
criteria
incited
to
them.
the
one
appellant's
position
with
respect
to
rabinovitch
is
standing
or
is
not
a
merely
formality
that
he
didn't
obtain
a
final
adjudication
or
final
administrative
determination
of
his
rights.
although,
i
certainly
think
that
would
be
sufficient
in
itself,
the
point
is,
he
never
alleged
a
present
need
for
the
loan
and
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
he
would
have
a
deficiency
between
his
anticipated
expenses
and
his
income
would
warrant
a
loan.
he
says
in
his
brief
in
response
here,
that,
well,
he
wouldn't
ask
for
an
interest
free
loan
which
is
one
of
the
subsidies
provided
by
the
program.
of
course,
the
additional
subsidy
provided
by
the
program.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes
it
does
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
well,
first
of
all,
he
didn't
file
and
we
don't,
first
of
all
they
talk
about.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
in
reality,
your
honor,
the
loan
application
usually
goes
first
to
the
bank
and
the
lender
under
this
program,
is
not
the
state
of
new
york
or
the
new
york
state
higher
education
services
corporation
but
a
bank
and
it
goes
to
a
bank
for
the
obvious
purpose,
that
all
loan
applications
go
to
a
bank
to
see
if
the
individual
who
wants
to
borrow
the
money,
needs
the
money.
now,
grant
it,
there
is
a
provision
about
citizenship
but
we
don't
know
how
this
application
would
have
been
disposed,
and
we
certainly
don't
know
whether
he
needs
the
money
within
any
definition
of
the
program.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
you
mean,
if
he
paid
it
out
of
violation
of
the
statute?
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
obviously,
not
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
your
honor,
the
same
new
york
official
who
in
fact
as
i
just
pointed
out,
does
not
pay
out
the
money
would
equally
in
violation
of
law
or
certainly
be
exercising
extraordinarily
poor
judgment,
if
he
paid
out
the
money
to
somebody
who
didn't
need
it.
i
mean,
indeed
that's
the
whole
point,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
claim
is
premature
and
it's
effect
is
speculative.
i
would
just
like
to
close,
it
appears
i
have
to
close.
thank
you,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
i
think
that
new
york
has
unquestioned
power
under
the
(inaudible).
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
i
think
it
has
that
power
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
your
honor,
the
statute
asks
exactly
the
same
commitment
from
citizens
and
aliens.
a
commitment
to
the
united
states
is
possessed
by
any
united
states
citizens
by
virtue
of
his
status.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
the
answer
is
no,
new
york
does
not
think
that's
adequate
that
the
citizen
and
the
alien
both
are
treated
identically
under
the
statute
and
that
the
result
is
a
benign
classification.
thank
you,
your
honor.
