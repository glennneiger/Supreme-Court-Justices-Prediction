unknown
speaker
miss
gordon
how
much
are
we
talking
about
in
dollars,
do
you
have
any
idea?
unknown
speaker
well
how
many
aliens
are
there
who
would
eligible
if
the
judgment
of
this
court
is
upheld,
how
much
are
we
talking
in
dollars
in
that
point.
unknown
speaker
of
course
not,
the
question
i
asked,
is
how
much
are
we
litigating
about
in
this
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
so
we
may
not
be
speaking
about
very
much?
unknown
speaker
but
this
is
what
i
suppose,
it
isn't
strictly
a
question
of
cost
anyway,
if
these
people
are
eligible
that
excludes
others
who
might
otherwise
get?
unknown
speaker
it
is
the
question
of
who
will
get
the
piece
of
the
pie?
unknown
speaker
now,
the
kind
of
grants
you
are
talking
about
here
are
not
ultimately
repayable,
i
tell
you,
they
are
not
loans.
unknown
speaker
well,
except,
i
would
think
for
you
would
have
an
argument
available
to
you
in
the
loan
situation
that
you
don't
have
in
the
grant
situation,
that
someone
who
insists
on
remaining
a
national,
a
national
of
portugal
is
much
more
apt
to
be
avoid
service
of
process,
that
new
york
tries
to
compel
repayment
of
a
loan,
20
years
from
now,
than
someone
who
is
a
resident
of
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
miss
gordon,
i
am
not
sure,
it
would
make
at
least
for
me,
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
a
$100,000
a
year
or
$10
million
a
year
but
if
the
district
court
is
correct,
is
it
unreasonable
to
speculate
that
this
might
bring
an
influx
of
graduate
students
from
countries
all
over
the
world
who
would
be
pass
to
our
door.
unknown
speaker
do
you
say,
our
government
is
paralytic
to
keep
the
aliens
from
coming?
unknown
speaker
federal
government.
unknown
speaker
so,
i
don't
understand
about
this
great
inflow,
if
we
could
stop
that
easily.
unknown
speaker
what
about
united
state
citizens
who
are
say,
native
californians,
who
come
to
new
york
and
stay
there
temporarily,
are
they
eligible?
unknown
speaker
would
the
influx
problem
be
any
different
for
worrying
about
people
coming
from
california
than
from
france?
unknown
speaker
well
let's
assume
there
is
a
state,
are
there
are
any
states
that
have
less
desirable
programs
than
new
york
does?
unknown
speaker
let
me
take
such
a
state
for
my
hypothetical
example.
unknown
speaker
then
take
such
a
state,
would
your
influx
problem
be
any
different
for
people
who
live
in
such
a
state
as
compared
to
people
who
live
in
a
foreign
country
with
a
less
desirable
program.
i
suppose
it's
probably
a
greater
possibility
they
come
from
neighboring
states,
than
they
come
to
know
about
it,
one
thing
or
another.
we
are
just
worrying
about
the
influx
problem.
unknown
speaker
miss
gordon,
what
would
you
regard
as
the
primary
purpose
of
the
statute,
i
think,
i
have
sensed
a
few
that
you
have
in
remarks,
but
tell
me
what
do
you
think
are
the
primary
purpose
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
a
federal
concern
rather
than
a
state
concern,
number
one
and
number
two
how
do
you
defeat
what
mr.
justice
stevens
has
been
talking
about,
of
having
a
great
influx
from
other
states,
you
can
say
new
jersey
and
connecticut
if
you
want
rather
than
go
away
across
the
country,
who
might
think
they
can
get
a
better
deal
in
new
york,
and
we're
willing
to
be
there
for
few
years.
now,
how
do
you
defeat
that,
you
admit
them
to
your
program,
don't
you?
putting
another
way,
isn't
this
the
same
argument
that
was
made
here
in
in
re
griffiths
and
all
the
other
alien
cases.
unknown
speaker
but
precisely,
that's
my
point
you
see.
unknown
speaker
cannot
participate
in
one
sense,
voting?
unknown
speaker
well
some
of
those
issues
are
under
consideration,
here
right
now.
i
don't
think
you
can
assume
them.
unknown
speaker
would
you
follow
them
from
admittance
to
the
state
universities.
unknown
speaker
and
the
difference
is?
unknown
speaker
you
said,
all
the
money
is
just
given
away,
do
not
require
to
you
say.
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you
could
exclude
him...
unknown
speaker
from
admission.
unknown
speaker
new
york
state
university.
they
have
got
a
million
dollars
and
they
pay
in
their
own
way,
could
you
exclude
them
because
they
are
aliens?
unknown
speaker
could
you
charge
the
alien
with
non
resident
tuition
equal
top
what
you
charge
non-resident
students
and
who
are
shifted
to
united
states?
unknown
speaker
do
you
confine
your
loan
and
scholarship
programs
to
residents
in
new
york?
unknown
speaker
hence
that
they
are
residents
or
citizens
of
new
york?
unknown
speaker
when
do
you
get
to
be
a
citizen?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
say
i
move
to
new
york
from
new
jersey
and
i
am
going
to
reside
there,
you
mean
i
am
not
a
citizen?
unknown
speaker
well
that's
what
i
am
asking
you,
if
i
become
a
resident
of
new
york,
moving
from
another
state,
am
i
a
citizen?
unknown
speaker
so
you
confine
your
loan
and
scholarship
programs
to
citizens?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
--
you
cannot,
it
cannot
effect
of
your
program,
whether
i
am
a
citizen
--
even
though
i
am
a
citizen
of
united
states.
i
cannot
participate
in
your
loan
program,
unless
i
am
a
citizen
in
new
york.
unknown
speaker
you
said
i
have
to
be
a
resident?
unknown
speaker
alright
so
we
are
not
really
treating
your
alien
very
much,
any
much
differently
he
still
has
to
be
a
citizen?
unknown
speaker
or
if
there
is
some
barrier
to
his
becoming
a
citizenship
and
you
can
control...
unknown
speaker
not
a
large
differences
between
this
case
and
the
others
to
which
reference
has
been
made,
maybe
you
touched
on,
and
i
didn't
understand
it,
is
that
this
involves
a
system
of
state
largess
giving
money
away.
unknown
speaker
or
a
job
opportunity
or
turn
them
into
something
you
achieve
statutorily
in
time...
unknown
speaker
the
state
also
quote,
use
the
word
largess
but
what
about
the
amount
of
money
that's
put
into
the
university,
what
is
that?
that's
a
huge
amount.
unknown
speaker
but
you
can't
bar
him
from
that,
but
your
point
is
you
cant
bar
him
from
that
but
you
bar
him
from
this
extra,
is
there
are
a
better
way,
i
put?
unknown
speaker
would
it
make
any
difference,
if
he
didn't
have
an
american
wife
or
an
american
child?
unknown
speaker
your
argument
goes
to
any
legally
present
resident
alien?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
give
any
indication
as
to
what
percentage
of
permanent
aliens
actually
are
permanent
in
the
sense
that
they
never
returned
to
their
native
homelands?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
why
your
client
does
not
wish
to
apply
for
american
citizenship?
unknown
speaker
well
again,
what
is
the
difference
does
that
make
in
constitutional
sense?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
more
bankrupt?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
say,
hypothetically
to
a
hypothetical
statute
of
this
time.
new
york
legislature
after
conducting
hearings
determines
that
they
are
lacking
3000-4000
positions
who
are
needed
or
the
projections
are
that
within
five
years
they
will
need
4000
more
physicians.
so
they
develop
a
grand
program
to
pay
the
entire
tuition
for
new
york
residents
for
any
accredited
medical
school
in
new
york
and
aliens,
the
citizenship
in
the
united
states
and
residents
in
new
york
being
required,
what
would
you
say
to
that?
unknown
speaker
that's
a
little
different
from
--
i
am
talking
about
a
program
whose
aim
is
to
induce
some
people
to
become
physicians
in
new
york.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
let
me
add
another
clause
to
the
statute
that
to
secure
this
grant,
you
must
make
a
pledge
to
remain
in
the
practice
of
medicine
in
the
state
of
new
york
for
not
less
than
ten
years
and
failing
to
do
so,
you
would
be
required
to
pay
one-tenth
of
the
total
cost
of
the
grant
of
the
scholarship
for
each
year
that
you
fail
to
stay
in
new
york.
unknown
speaker
one
of
the
conditions
generally
upon
these
three
programs
are,
three
sources
of
money
are
available.
there
is
the
region
scholarship
and
that's
a
comparative
merit.
unknown
speaker
for
a
limited
number
of
people
on
the
basis
of
an
examination
or
an
oral
examination
or
an
interview?
unknown
speaker
then,
there
is
a
tat,
which
is
a
grant
of
$250
each,
is
that
available
to
any
body
who
is
admitted
by
state
university?
unknown
speaker
depending
upon
the
need
of
course.
unknown
speaker
all
schools
of
higher
education.
unknown
speaker
post
high
school.
unknown
speaker
if
there
is
need
there
is
a
grant
for
anybody
who
has
been
admitted
or
whose
is
in
a
college
or
university.
unknown
speaker
from
the
tat?
unknown
speaker
how
about
--
the
loan
is
similar
to
tat,
so
far
as
conditions
of?
unknown
speaker
how
far
in
the
family
--
what
is
the
degree
of
relationship?
unknown
speaker
grand
children.
unknown
speaker
could
the
state
of
new
york,
constitutionally
in
your
view,
have
this
provision
that
we
were
discussing
before
that
he
would
pledge
to
remain
a
resident
of
new
york
for
at
least
five
years
after
he
completed
the
graduate
work?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
different
between
that
course
and
then
the
kind
that
is
exerted
on
him
now,
except
that
--
say
it
isn't
applied
across
the
board,
is
there
any
other?
unknown
speaker
where
are
you
reading?
unknown
speaker
it
is
written
in
the
appendix
or
it
is
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
the
same
legislature
that
excluded
the
aliens.
unknown
speaker
you
have
details
about
all?
unknown
speaker
could
the
new
york
legislature
give
the
resident
aliens
of
this
category,
the
right
to
vote
in
new
york
elections?
could
they
do
it
under
their
constitution?
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
statistics
in
the
record
that
would
indicate
whether
the
parents
of
the
aliens
who
apply
for
this
sort
of
grant
are
themselves
residents
of
new
york
or
residents
of
united
states
or
are
on
the
contrary
residents
of
some
other
country?
unknown
speaker
percentages.
unknown
speaker
didn't
mathews
v.
diaz,
last
year
though,
contained
language
contrary
to
that,
which
you
just
suggest
that
it
is
permissible
to
distinguish
within
classes
of
aliens
when
the
federal
government
does
it?
unknown
speaker
but
then
it
does
not
make
any
sense
to
say
that
these
are
really
not
discriminations
or
that
they
really
are
discriminations.
what
you
are
really
saying
is
that
one
level
of
government
has
the
right
to
make
them
and
the
other
doesn't,
not
that
when
one
makes
the
thing
that
the
other
does,
there
are
discriminations
in
that
and
in
the
other
case
they
are
not?
unknown
speaker
that
is
you
mean,
the
fact
that
some
aliens
are
eligible?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
student
assistance,
there
generally
is,
institutions
of
higher
learning
today,
students
don't
pay
the
full
cost.
even
it
they
pay
the
full
fees,
that's
not
the
full
cost.
unknown
speaker
it's
generally
about
50-60%
of
it,
and
if
the
most.
unknown
speaker
did
you
apply
to
ask
for
a
loan?
unknown
speaker
how
does
he
have
standing
to
raise
the
loan
question?
unknown
speaker
the
standing
is
done
based
on
how
the
qualifier
has
numbered
the
sections
of
the
statutes?
unknown
speaker
except,
i
thought
the
state
had
always
taken
position
that
your
client
does
not
have
standing
to
raise.
unknown
speaker
that's
what,
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
does
the
application
for
the
loan
have
a
blank
that
says
whether
he
is
a
citizen
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
could
be
the
sense
of
him
filing?
unknown
speaker
what
could
be
the
sense?
unknown
speaker
i
assume
that
if
the
new
york
official
paid
money
to
a
non-resident
alien
who
said
he
didn't
ever
intend
to
be
an
alien,
would
be
proper?
unknown
speaker
could
he
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well
why
should
he
have
to
go
through
that?
when
there
is
no
way
he
could
get
it.
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you
before
you
close,
what's
your
understanding
on
the
power
of
new
york
to
impose
a
residency
requirement
for
the
disbursement
of
these
loans?
unknown
speaker
what's
your
understanding
of
the
state's
power
to
impose
one
year
residence
requirement?
unknown
speaker
new
york
apparently
thinks
that
is
not
sufficient
for
its
purposes.
unknown
speaker
so,
your
answer
is...
unknown
speaker
no,
new
york,
does
not
think
that's
adequately.
