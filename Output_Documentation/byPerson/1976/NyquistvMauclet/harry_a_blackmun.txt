justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
litigation
comes
to
us
on
appeal
from
judgments
of
the
united
states
district
court's
for
both
the
western
and
the
eastern
districts
of
new
york.
the
state
of
new
york
has
a
statute
that
bars
certain
resident
aliens
from
state
financial
assistance
for
higher
education.
the
particular
statute
at
issue
here
is
subdivision
3
of
section
661
of
the
new
york
education
law.
it
provides
that
an
applicant
for
financial
assistance
must
either
be
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
or
have
applied
for
citizenship
or
if
not
qualified,
must
state
that
he
has
an
intent
to
apply
as
soon
as
he
is
qualified.
the
resident
aliens
to
whom
this
applies,
of
course,
like
citizens
who
pay
taxes
and
support
the
economy
and
served
in
the
military
service
and
contribute
in
other
ways
to
our
society.
the
appellee,
mauclet
is
a
french
citizen
who
has
lived
in
new
york
since
1969.
he
is
married
to
an
american
woman
and
has
a
child
by
that
marriage
and
that
child,
of
course,
is
an
american
citizen.
although,
he
is
presently
qualified
to
apply
for
citizenship
and
intends
to
reside
permanently
in
this
country,
he
states
that
he
does
not
wish
to
relinquish
his
french
citizenship
at
this
time.
the
second
appellee,
rabinovitch,
is
a
canadian.
he
came
to
the
united
states
in
1964
at
the
age
of
nine.
he
is
registered
for
selective
service.
he
is
a
graduate
of
the
new
york
public
school
system
and
he
too
states
that
he
intends
to
continue
to
reside
in
new
york
but
not
now
to
become
a
naturalized
american
citizen.
both
brought
suit
claiming
that
the
citizenship
bar,
the
new
york
statute,
was
unconstitutional.
a
three-judge
court
heard
both
cases
and
rendered
judgment
in
favor
of
the
applicant's.
they
held
that
the
statute
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
it
served
to
discriminate
unconstitutionally
against
resident
aliens.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
affirmed
that
judgment.
the
court
already
has
stated
in
other
cases
that
a
state
classification
based
on
alienage
is
subject
to
close
scrutiny
by
the
courts.
new
york
argues
that
the
statute
provides
an
incentive
for
an
alien
to
become
naturalized.
while
this
maybe
true,
this
is
not
a
proper
state
concern
since
control
over
immigration
and
naturalization
is
exclusively
a
federal
function.
new
york
also
asserts
that
its
discrimination
serves
to
enhance
the
educational
level
of
the
electorate.
well,
that
challenge
would
serve
to
justify
every
discrimination
against
aliens.
and
furthermore,
the
interest
in
educating
the
electorate
would
not
be
frustrated
by
including
resident
aliens
in
the
assistance
program.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
powell
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
in
that
opinion
by
the
chief
justice
and
by
mr
.justice
stewart.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
therein
by
the
chief
justice.
