mr.
gary
j.
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
focusing
on
mr.
justice
stewart's
reference
to
new
york
dispensing
its
largess
to
certain
students
that
institutions
to
post
secondary
education.
we
think
it
can
hardly
be
classified
as
a
gift,
when
what
the
new
york
state
legislature
is
doing,
is
taking
the
tax
dollars
which
aliens
of
course,
contribute
equally
with
citizens
and
determining
to
dispense
them
in
a
particular
program.
now,
we
do
not
ask
this
court
and
we
did
not
ask
the
district
court
to
substitute
its
judgment,
for
the
judgment
of
the
new
york
state
legislature.
let
me
read
to
you,
that
judgment
is
articulated
in
1961
when
the
program
was
really
a
put
in
to
high
gear
and
the
tuition
assistance
awards
first
came
into
being.
the
new
york
state
legislature
said,
'higher
education
is
no
longer
a
luxury,
it
is
the
necessity
for
strength,
fulfillment
and
survival.'
now,
the
new
york
state
legislature
has
determined
that
this
type
of
program
is
vital,
it
is
essential
to
the
well
being
of
those
people
who
reside
in
the
state.
mr.
gary
j.
greenberg
that
comes
from
the
laws
of
the
1961,
chapter
389,
section
1(a).
mr.
gary
j.
greenberg
i
believe
actually
that
is
quoted
in
full
in
brief
of
the
state
and
as
a
further
indication
of
the
statutory
purpose
and
this
is
something
that
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief,
the
page
21,
in
1969,
when
the
program
was
somewhat
revised
again,
the
governor
rockefeller
in
his
memorandum
indicated,
this
is
the
memorandum
of
approval
of
the
bill,
that
the
new
revisions
would
do
much
to
further
new
york
state's
goal
that
no
young
man
or
woman
with
the
capacity
and
desired
to
seek
a
college
education
should
be
prevented
from
doing
so,
for
lack
of
financial
resources.
no
reference
to
citizen,
simply
recognition?
mr.
gary
j.
greenberg
that's
the
same
legislature
that?
mr.
gary
j.
greenberg
well
i
don't
really,
we
don't
really
know
why
the
legislature
or
excluded
the
aliens.
we
have
no
legislative
history
and
aliens
have
been
excluded
in
one
fashion
or
another
but
no
in
a
consistent
manner,
since,
approximately
1917,
yet
the
new
york
state
legislature
has
never
told
us
why
they
opted
to
exclude
aliens,
to
the
extent
the
legislative
history
gives
any
guide,
it
is
one;
administrative
convenience
and
two;
the
saving
of
$10,000.
the
jurist
prudence
of
this
court
makes
it
clear
that
those
purposes
clearly
can
not
satisfy
new
york's
burden,
when
it
invokes
this
types
of
invidious
classification.
mr.
gary
j.
greenberg
under
the
present
constitution,
they
could
do
not
do
it.
in
fact,
at
one
point,
i
think
until
1825,
new
york
in
fact
allowed,
resident
aliens
to
vote,
as
i
think
virtually
every
state
did
at
that
point
in
our
history.
i
think,
it's
clear
that
this
court
has
determined
that
new
york
can
exclude
resident
aliens
from
voting,
it
can
exclude
them
from
holding
elective
office,
it
can
exclude
them
from
high
policy
making
office
and
the
issue
before
this
court,
maybe
in
the
next
case
would
be
whether
that
includes
the
state
police
officer.
mr.
gary
j.
greenberg
there
are
no
such
statistics.
the
facts
in
this
case
indicate
that
mr.
rabinovitch,
his
entire
family
is
resident
in
new
york
and
has
been
since
1964.
there
are
no
statistics
as
to
in
general.
mr.
gary
j.
greenberg
no,
we
do
not
have
that
and
i
do
not
know
if
such
statistics
are
maintained
anywhere
frankly.
the
state
argues
and
perhaps
there
was
some
suggestion
that
this
issue
troubled
the
court,
and
i
refer
to
specifically
to
justice
white's
question,
that
we
really
do
not
have
the
discrimination
against
aliens
here,
that
the
statutory
distinction
is
something
different.
the
state
argues,
we
are
not
discriminating
between
citizens
and
alien,
that
what
this
statute
does,
is
it
discriminates
within
the
class
of
aliens.
we
think
that
reasoning
as
the
district
court
put
it,
simply
defines
logic.
indeed,
in
preparing
for
this
argument,
i
had
occasion
to
look
at
your
decision
last
term
in
mathews
v.
lucas
that
involved
the
social
security,
dependency
allowance
to
legitimate
children
with
certain
presumptions
as
to
dependency
for
legitimates
and
certain
presumptions
within
the
category
of
illegitimates
and
apparently
the
solicitor
general
argued,
this
was
not
a
discrimination
between
the
legitimate
and
the
illegitimates,
and
in
a
footnote
11,
this
court
says,
that's
nonsense
just
because
you
have
distinctions
within
the
class
of
illegitimates,
you
cannot
argue
logically
that
therefore
this
is
not
a
distinction
between
the
legitimate
and
illegitimate
children.
we
have
here
a
statute
which
on
its
face
says,
'citizens
and
those
aliens
who
are
willing
to
apply
for
citizenship
will
receive
a
certain
benefit'.
mr.
gary
j.
greenberg
yes,
when
the
federal
government
does
it,
that
kind
of
distinction
is
permissible
and
the
fourth
part
of
the
mathew's
opinion
makes
the
very
clear
distinction
that
while
it
is
the
normal
every
day
constitutional
function
of
the
federal
government
to
distinguish
within
the
class
of
aliens
and
between
citizens
and
aliens,
entirely
different
considerations
are
involved
when
a
state
makes
that
kind
of
discrimination.
mr.
gary
j.
greenberg
oh,
no,
absolutely
they
are
clearly
classifications
of
discriminations
and
the
what
mathews
holds
is
the
federal
government
has
the
power
and
reading
hampton
together
with
mathews,
at
least
the
president
and
the
congress
have
the
power
to
make
such
discriminations.
what
mathews,
i
think
quite
clearly
holds
in
the
fourth
part
of
the
opinion,
is
that
the
state
governments
do
not
have
the
similar
power,
unless
and
i
have
heard
very
little
today
about
the
unless
part,
unless
the
discrimination
satisfies
some
legitimate
and
substantial
state
interests.
we
look
to
see
what
the
state
interest
is,
in
this
particular
statutory
classification.
frankly,
the
argument
put
forth
by
the
stat,
we
think
is
nothing
but
a
convenient
but
false
post-talk
rationalization.
the
state
tells
us
that
they
are
seeking
to
encourage
in
essence,
voter
registration
and
office
holdings.
now,
how
does
the
statue
which
simply
provides
tuition
assistance,
region
scholarship
or
student
loans
encourage
voter
registration
or
office
holding?
indeed,
when
confronted
with
this
particular
statutory
purpose,
the
district
court
said
not
only
can
the
state
satisfy
a
substantial
interest
here,
there
isn't
even
a
rational
relationship
between
this
asserted
purpose
and
the
statute
under
consideration.
we
search
a
link
to
seek
a
method
by
which
this
statue
will
some
how
further
these
goals
and
indeed
it
is
interesting
to
know
as
the
brief
for
mauclet
points
out
in
detail.
new
york
has
a
variety,
a
whole
host
of
these,
habitual
reflexive
discriminations
against
the
aliens
and
they
are
in
court
on
many
of
these
cases
right
now.
in
every
one
of
these
cases,
the
same
rationalization
is
used.
we
are
told
that
requiring
citizenship
for
the
licensing
of
physicians
promotes
the
new
york
political
community.
the
state
argued,
believe
it
or
not
that
the
same
political
community
rationale
justified
their
requirement
that
physical
therapist
be
citizens
of
united
states.
it
is
a
ubiquitous
argument
trodded
out
on
every
occasion
by
the
new
york
attorney
general
presumably
seeking
to
find
support
in
the
sugarman
caveat
as
what
would
be
a
substantial
state
interest.
in
this
particular
case,
we
don't
see
the
how
the
statute
even
approaches
anything
which
we
could
be
consider
to
be
a
substantial
interest.
we
don't
see
how
the
statute
is
narrowly
and
precisely
drawn
to
promote
the
interest.
indeed,
we
think
it's
clear
and
we
think
legislative
memorandum
number
8
focusing
on
the
$10,000
saving.
we
think
it's
clear
that
what
new
york
was
doing
was
out
of
habit,
focusing
on
a
traditionally
discriminated
class
and
seeking
to
save
a
few
dollars
of
their
expense
and
doing
it
in
a
situation
where
the
new
york
legislature
has
already
determined
the
significance
and
the
importance
of
this
program
to
the
individual.
now,
the
fact
that
total
foreclosure
is
not
the
consequence
of
this
program,
should
make
we
think,
no
difference.
mr.
gary
j.
greenberg
the
fact
that
some
aliens
are
eligible,
the
fact
that
aliens
can
go
to
the
universities
if
they
can
fund
the
particular
cost
themselves
without
any
student
assistance,
what
the
state
argues...
mr.
gary
j.
greenberg
oh!
absolutely.
mr.
gary
j.
greenberg
that's
right,
but
in
case
for
example,
mr.
rabinovitch,
he
now,
has
$925
annual
tuition
cost.
if
he
were
a
citizen
and
in
his
case,
he
would
have
to
do
have
more
than
the
clear
intention,
he
would
have
to
actually
because
he
is
eligible,
he
would
via
the
region
scholarship
which
he
won
on
a
competitive
examination
and
via
tuition
assistance,
that
full
amount
covered.
in
his
economic
circumstances,
this
imposes
an
enormous
burden
upon
him
and
his
family,
because
he
gets
no
assistance,
none
whatsoever.
now,
i
should
like
to
make
two
additional
points
before
closing.
with
reference
to
the
loan
program,
the
state
made
some
reference
to
a
requirement
or
a
request
for
remand,
i
frankly
don't
understand
what
they
are
talking
about
--
the
state
had
a
full
opportunity
to
try
this
case
below,
the
state
moved
for
summary
judgment,
the
state
didn't
seek
to
introduce
an
additional
evidence.
the
considerations
on
the
loan
program
are
quite
frankly
exactly
the
same.
mr.
gary
j.
greenberg
my
client
indicated
that
he
might,
for
purposes
of
graduate
school,
require
a
loan.
he
has
never
actually
applied
for
a
loan.
mr.
gary
j.
greenberg
we
think
because
we
have
a
single
statutory
prescription,
that
is
to
say
661
(3)
covers
all
three
programs,
because
he
has
been
injured
in
connection
with
two
of
the
programs,
because
the
state
has
admitted
and
admitted
in
the
argument
below
and
it's
reflected
in
the
opinion
that
if
he
applies
for
a
loan,
he
will
automatically
be
denied
assistance.
mr.
gary
j.
greenberg
well,
i
don't
think
it's
based
on
simply
the
numbering
but
we
do
have
a
single
statutory
program
here
and
it
would
make
very
little
sense
to
require
rabinovitch
to
go
back,
file
his
application,
have
it
denied
and
come
right
back
up
on
issues
that
would
be
virtually
identical.
so,
we
see
that
there
is
no
--
the
remand
in
this
case
can
serve
no
purpose,
and
indeed
the
state
has
never
asked
for
it,
and
never
sought
to
introduce
any
evidence
or
deal
with
the
loan
program
in
anyway
differently
until
this
moment.
finally,
we
would
point
to
the
supremacy.
mr.
gary
j.
greenberg
yes,
the
standing
point,
they
have
raised
from
the
beginning.
mr.
gary
j.
greenberg
finally,
with
the
regard
to
the
supremacy
argument,
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
recognize
that
the
united
states
government
has
allowed
the
appellees
in
this
case,
to
enter
and
reside
in
the
united
state
and
they
have
done
so,
without
requiring
any
declaration
of
intention
to
become
a
citizen
at
any
time.
second
of
all,
there
is
a
statutory
provision,
42
u.
s.c
1981,
which
this
court
has
relied
upon
in
takahashi
and
graham,
which
indicates
that
resident
aliens
have
a
right
to
enter
and
abide
within
all
of
the
united
states.
and
in
equality,
legal
privilege
and
right,
and
that
when
new
york
enacts
its
program,
it
is
clearly
interfering
with
the
general
plan
and
program
articulated
by
the
federal
government
in
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
indeed
--
i
am
sorry,
i
see
my
time
is
up.
mr.
gary
j.
greenberg
indeed,
the
enactment
of
the
parole
refugee
provision
is
simply
new
york's
recognition,
that
by
keeping
out
of
the
program,
people
whom
the
federal
government
has
allowed
into
the
united
states,
they
are
burdening
the
residence
of
these
people
and
they
are
imposing
upon
them
burdens
not
contemplated
when
the
federal
government
allowed
them
entry
and
residence
in
this
country.
thank
you.
