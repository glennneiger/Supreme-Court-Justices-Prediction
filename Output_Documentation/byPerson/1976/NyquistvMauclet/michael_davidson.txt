mr.
michael
davidson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
jean-marie
mauclet
is
the
husband
of
a
citizen,
he
and
his
wife
have
a
citizen
child.
he
is
an
immigrant
to
this
country
and
he
is
entitled
by
the
congress
of
the
untied
states
to
make
this
his
permanent
home.
if
the
judgment.
mr.
michael
davidson
yes,
i
think
it
would
make
a
difference
in
that,
the
fact
that
he
has
an
american
wife
and
an
american
child
makes
his
residency
in
this
country
at
the
heart
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act.
it's
the
central
function
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act.
as
it
now
has
been
amended
in
1965
and
is
recently
at
the
last
session
of
congress,
is
to
facilitate
the
unification
of
families,
families
of
citizens
and
immigrants
or
families
of
immigrants
and
this
is
evident
in
a
number
of
ways,
the
immediate
relative
of
the
united
state
citizen
maybe
admitted
to
this
country
without
regard
to
numerical
limitation.
although
this
country
has
felt
it
important
to
place
limits
on
the
number
of
immigrants
since
1921.
mr.
michael
davidson
yes,
it
goes
to
any,
but
i
think
it
should
be
recognized
that
74%
of
the
preferences
in
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act
apply
to
members
of
families,
families
of
citizens,
families
of
resident
aliens.
i
think
it's
also
significant
because
it
is
far
more
than
the
alien
who
is
injured
here,
it
is
his
citizen
wife
and
his
citizen
child
who
are
injured
when
he
is
deprived
of
an
equal
access
to
an
education
which
would
enable
him
to
support
that
family
unit.
mr.
michael
davidson
no,
there
is
no
such
part
of
this
record.
the
only
statistics
in
that
we
have
our
statistics
in
our
brief
which
indicate
that
we
are
really
talking
about
a
very
small
percentage
of
people
in
the
state
university
system
in
new
york
less
than
three
tenth
of
1%.
mr.
michael
davidson
no
it
does
not.
it
simply
contains
his
statement
that
he
did
not
wish
when
asked
by
the
state
to
apply
for
citizenship
at
that
time.
the
state
neither
answered
or
complained
nor
answered
our
affidavit,
it
simply
accepted
those
statements
contained
in
those
documents
treated
this
matter
as
having
really
no
disputable
issues
of
fact
and
proceeded
to
move
as
we
did
to
summary
judgment.
to
affirm
the
judgment
below
would
not
mean
that
there
would
be
a
massive
influx
of
students
to
this
country,
who
might
obtain
the
benefits
of
new
york
assistance.
new
york
has
a
residency
requirement,
non-immigrant
students,
a
very
large
group
of
foreign
students
who
come
to
study
here
annually
are
precluded
from
obtaining
new
york
residency.
they
are
precluded
by
state
regulation,
in
fact
they
are
precluded
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act.
that
act
requires
that
they
have
some
residence
somewhere
else
in
the
world
and
they
would
be
subject
deportation
if
they
claim
to
the
state
of
new
york
that
they
were
residents
of
that
state.
now,
the
history
of
this
act,
the
state
act
involved
also
indicates
that
we
are
really
talking
about
a
very
small
number
of
people
and
the
state
understands
that
to
be
true.
mr.
michael
davidson
well,
i
think
it
even
makes
the
state
action
far
more
capricious
than
i
would
argue
it,
it
is.
in
1961,
when
this
program
was
established,
there
was
no
citizenship
requirement
and
for
a
period
of
eight
years,
immigrant
and
citizen
in
new
york
state
were
entitled
on
equal
terms
to
access
the
state
tuition
assistance.
in
1969,
the
state
enacted
the
citizenship
requirement
which
is
now
under
review.
the
only
indication
of
legislative
history,
legislative
policy
involved
is
an
estimate
by
the
staff
of
the
appropriate
legislative
committee,
that
there
might
be
50
students
in
the
state
who
would
be
excluded
by
this
provision
and
a
sum
of
$10,000
say
--
that
figure
incidentally
disappeared
from
all
further
accountings
and
it
could
very
well
be
the
state
anticipated
no
savings
because
if
they
are
right,
if
it
functions
as
an
inducement
for
people
to
petition
for
citizenship,
then
the
net
result
might
be
more
citizens
and
no
savings
in
funds.
i
think
that
requires
us
to
put
aside
any
possible
suggestion
that
the
state
of
new
york
might
be
bankrupted
by
a
judgment
which
requires
them
to
treat
immigrants
and
citizens
alike.
mr.
michael
davidson
more
bankrupt.
mr.
michael
davidson
i
would
say
that
would
be
invalid
statute
as
the
matter
of
fact,
the
district
court
in
new
york
has
invalidated
the
state's
citizenship
requirements
for
doctors
following
this
courts
decision
in
regard
to
engineers
and
attorneys.
mr.
michael
davidson
yes,
and
if
an
immigrant
is
entitled
equally
with
a
citizen
to
become
a
doctor
then
our
argument
would
be
that
he
is
entitled
to
the
opportunity
to
become
a
doctor.
mr.
michael
davidson
i
believe
that
will
be
a
permissible
statute,
because
it
would
require
the
same
commitment
by
the
citizens
as
it
would
require
of
immigrants.
in
fact,
the
state
of
new
york
and
other
jurisdictions
have
such
statutes
in
which
medical
students
pledge
to
work
in
designated
areas,
in
return
for
assistance.
the
program
is
more
than
a
program
of
largesse.
it
is
the
judgment
of
the
state
of
new
york
that
this
assistance
is
necessary
to
achieve
post
secondary
education,
in
these
times.
it
is
not
our
task
nor
do
we
think
it's
a
burden
of
the
court
to
decide
for
itself
whether
this
assistance
is
necessary,
that
is
fact
has
been
the
determination
of
the
state
of
new
york.
i
think
that
we
are
entitled
to
take
the
state
at
its
word
in
that
respect.
i
think
we
are
also
entitled
to
take
the
state
at
its
word
that
if
it's
assistance
is
unavailable,
a
large
group
of
people
will
not
receive
the
adequate
and
sufficient
training
to
deal
in
a
technical
and
difficult
society.
this
program
involves
more
than
colleges
and
universities,
although
people
are
certainly
assisted
in
large
numbers
there.
it
involves
assistance
to
re-granting
trade
in
technical
schools,
nursing
programs,
registered
business
schools.
the
means
of
entries
that
people
have
following
secondary
education
to
an
opportunity
to
earn
a
decent
livelihood.
mr.
michael
davidson
that's
right,
for
a
limited
number
of
people.
mr.
michael
davidson
a
written
examination.
mr.
michael
davidson
well
that
tuition
assistance
program.
mr.
michael
davidson
it
is
applies
to
all
schools,
whether
that
be
the
state
university
or
private
schools.
mr.
michael
davidson
all
schools
of
post
secondary
education.
mr.
michael
davidson
the
grants
run
from
a
$100
to
$1500
all
based
on
needs.
if
there
is
no
need,
there
is
no
grant
for
undergraduate
students,
$600
for
graduate
students.
but,
the
only
requirements.
mr.
michael
davidson
exactly,
it
is
considered
to
be
an
entitlement
program,
admission
to
an
approved
institution
in
need
are
the
sole
requirements
for
the
receipt
of
the
grants.
mr.
michael
davidson
that's
right.
mr.
michael
davidson
well
the
loan
programs
are
different.
mauclet
has
not
complained
of
the
denial
of
a
loan,
neither
has
he
complained
of
the
denial
of
the
region
scholarship,
both
of
those
programs
are
different.
his
focus
is
entirely
on
tuition
assistance
program.
there
is
an
addition,
a
maximum
amount
based
upon
the
amount
of
tuition,
no
person
may
received
more
than
a
tuition
for
the
program
in
which
he
is
eligible.
so,
this
is
not
a
sum
of
money
which
he
may
use
for
any
different
and
individual
purpose.
may,
i
just
return
one
moment
to
the
importance
which
immigration
and
naturalization
act
places
on
the
unification
of
these
families.
there
is
a
requirement
in
the
act
that
certain
categories
of
the
immigrants
receive
certificates
from
the
secretary
of
labor,
before
they
may
be
admitted
which
would
establish
that
they
would
not
disadvantage
citizen
workers.
displace
them
at
their
work,
force
reduction
in
wages
or
working
conditions.
the
act
specifically
exempts
all
immediate
relatives,
all
relatives
is
in
fact,
because
it
is
so
important
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
that
these
people
have
an
opportunity
to
reside
permanently
in
this
country,
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
their
family
units
which
must
be
also
the
integrity
of
it
as
an
economic
unit.
mr.
michael
davidson
well,
in
terms
of
intermediate
relatives,
it's
spouses,
children,
and
parents
and
then
the
system
of
preferences
moves
progressively
beyond
that
ultimately
to
brothers
and
sisters.
mr.
michael
davidson
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
if
the
congress
has
to
make
that
judgment
that
it
is
so
significant
as
a
matter
of
national
policy,
no
matter
what
the
effect
on
present
residents
of
the
united
states
may
be,
we
think
that
it
is
a
conflict
to
that
congressional
scheme,
for
the
state
of
new
york
to
impose
its
own
judgment
on
the
matter
and
to
say
that
these
immigrant
families
are
less
worthy
of
its
assistance.
also,
the
state
makes
the
argument,
well,
there
are
other
ways
in
which
person
may
finance
the
education.
well,
let's
choose
citizens
as
well.
these
are
integrated
programs.
the
federal
government
has
its
programs,
the
state
of
new
york
has
its
programs,
they
are
worked
together
by
rule
and
regulation
to
provide
a
composite.
the
state
of
new
york
says
to
a
student,
to
an
immigrant
student
that
he
may
not
receive
this
assistance,
he
does
--
the
state
places
in,
in
extreme
jeopardy
that
person's
opportunity
for
an
education.
let
me
conclude
this
section
by
indicating
that
the
objectives
of
the
states
of
new
york
which
it
proclaims
in
this
suit
that
of
encouraging
people
to
become
citizens.
it
is
an
objectives
which
is
properly
the
objective
of
the
national
government
and
this
is
another
aspect
of
the
state's
scheme
which
conflicts
with
the
general
national
regulation
of
immigration.
mauclet
has
not
excluded
the
possibility
of
the
becoming
a
citizen.
he
was
simply
not
ready
to
do
so,
when
the
state
in
essence
commanded
him
to
do
as
the
cost
of
his
education.
he
may
become
a
citizen
later
on.
the
naturalization
act
places
no
maximum
time
limit
on
a
person,
they
petition
to
citizenship.
it
only
places
in
a
minimum
period
of
time.
mr.
michael
davidson
i
think
he
could,
it
if
it
also
require
that
pledge
of
its
other
residents.
mr.
michael
davidson
the
essence
of
this
proceedings,
this
action
is
a
equality.
the
equality
as
required
by
immigration
and
naturalization
act
between
the
citizen
and
immigrant
or
a
equality
as
required
by
the
equal
protection
clause.
if
the
state
of
new
york
treats
its
immigrants
and
citizens
alike
then
we
would
have
no
objection
to
that,
thank
you.
