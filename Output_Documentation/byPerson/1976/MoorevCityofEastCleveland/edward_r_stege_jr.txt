mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
criminal
conviction
of
mrs.
iñez
moore
in
east
cleveland,
ohio
municipal
court.
mrs.
moore
is
a
grandmother.
she
was
convicted
under
a
city
ordinance
for
living
in
her
own
home
with
her
own
two
sons
and
her
two
grandsons.
she
appealed
the
conviction
to
the
ohio
county
court
of
appeals,
which
affirmed
with
one
judge
dissenting.
her
conviction
was
further
appealed
to
the
ohio
supreme
court
which
dismissed
the
appeal
for
want
of
a
substantial
constitutional
question
and
the
case
was
further
appealed
here.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
she
has
not.
that
five-day
prison
sentence
was
suspended
on
the
condition
that
she,
by
july
1st
,
1974,
which
was
roughly
45
days
after
the
conviction
was
handed
down,
that
she
put
her
grandson,
john
jr.,
out
of
her
home.
she
has
failed
to
do
that,
pending
the
appeal
to
this
court.
it
is
the
appellant's
position
in
this
case
that
the
east
cleveland
ordinance,
which
prevents
many
family
members
from
living
together
with
their
families
in
the
city
of
east
cleveland,
substantially
interferes
with
fundamental
rights
of
privacy
and
association
in
matters
of
family
life.
this
ordinance
is
both
over-broad
and
violated
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
the
justifications
offered
by
the
city
in
support
of
this
ordinance
simply
do
not
support
the
substantial
interference
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
well,
i
am
suggesting
that
all
the
cases
such
as,
for
example,
such
as
row
v.
wade,
the
abortion
decisions,
when
a
state
passes
a
statute
that
interferes,
i
think
the
danford
case
of
last
term,
which
interferes
too
seriously
with
a
fundamental
right
such
as,
in
that
case,
the
right
of
privacy,
the
right
to
control
the
decision
to
terminate
one’s
pregnancy,
that
in
a
sense
if
the
statute
interferes
too
deeply
with
that
fundamental
right,
it
is
truly
over-broad.
the
term
over-broad—
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
the
former,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
it
was
not
my
intention,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
rule
out
the
1st
amendment.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
i
think
so.
i
think
the
fundamental
right
here
does
not
arise
from
any
one
single
point
in
the
constitution.
it
arises
from
several
different
influences
in
the
constitution.
first
of
all,
it
arises
from
the
line
of
cases
beginning
with
skinner
v.
oklahoma,
which
discuss
and
afford
protection
to
the
right
to
procreate,
the
right
to
create
a
family,
the
right
to
determine
the
extent
of
one’s
own
family.
that
is
one
clearly
defined
source
of
constitutional
protection.
the
second
line
of
cases
is
that
line
beginning
with
myron
v.
nebraska
and
continuing
on
through
the
yoda
case,
the
school
education
case,
which
gives
parents
and
which
gives
persons
within
the
family
the
rights
to
control
the
very
upbringing
of
the
members
of
the
family,
particularly
the
minor
children,
to
make
decisions
about
the
rearing
of
those
children,
the
secular,
the
moral
education
of
those
children.
thirdly,
we
have
the
associational
interest
involved,
which
had
been
recognized
most
specifically
in
the
meryl
context
in
griswold
and
eisenstead,
which
i
think
also
extend
to
the
relationships
among
family
members.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
it
sweeps,
it
encompasses
ties
of
blood,
marriage
and
adoption.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
it
would
include
cousins,
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
i
think
that
begins
to
approach
an
area
in
which
the
legislative
body
might
step
in
and
determine
a
cut-off
point.
but
the
purpose
of
a
cut-off
point
is
completely
different.
it
is
a
matter
to
resolve
controversies.
it
is
a
matter
to
decide
perhaps,
the
third
cousin
is
too
close.
but
perhaps
the
fourth
and
fifth—
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
i
am
conceding
that
there
could
be
a
cut-off
point
but
for
a
very
different
purpose
than
this
ordinance
is
designed.
the
purpose
would
only
be
to
determine
at
what
very
attenuated
point
in
the
family
blood
lines,
do
family
members
who
are
related
to
the
thirty-second
degree,
let
us
say,
stand
in
effect
as
strangers
to
one
another.
that
would
be
the
sole
function
of
that
kind
of
limitation.
i
would
emphasize
that
i
do
not
think
that
that
kind
of
examples
has
a
lot
of
practical
significance
for
a
city
like
east
cleveland.
those
problems
simply
do
not
come
up,
and
for
example,
in
the
veltiere
(ph)
case,
the
ordinance
there
said
family
members
related
by
blood,
marriage
or
adoption.
and
state
courts—
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
it
is
not
this
ordinance.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
well,
as
long
as
they
were
minor
children,
as
long
as
they
have
no
children
of
their
own,
as
long
as
they
are
not
married.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
that
is
correct.
the
final
threat,
i
mentioned
three
–
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
i
am
not
sure,
to
be
honest
about
it,
i
am
not
sure
what
you
are
getting
at
by
the
term
“tribal
family”.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that,
well,
using
that
example
the
answer
is
clearly
no.
my
response
to
that
is
–
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
my
response
is
that
if
we
examine
the
prior
decisions
of
the
court,
they
build
on
blood
relationships.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
there
is
nothing
specifically
in
the
constitution.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
nothing
specifically
in
the
constitution
that
creates
a
fundamental
right
of
a
parent
to
raise
his
child.
it
has
been
recognized.
and
there
is
nothing
specifically
in
the
constitution
that
talks
about
procreation,
yet
it
has
been
recognized.
and
i
focus
on
certain
areas
of
decisions,
and
identify
three
of
them
and
the
third,
i
think,
relates
to
the
protection
that
has
been
accorded
to
the
family
home.
and
from
that,
we
assert
a
right
to
privacy
and
freedom
of
association
in
matters
of
family
life.
what
good
is
it
to
have
a
right
to
control
the
upbringing
of
your
child,
if
you
cannot
even
live
with
that
child?
in
the
prince
case—
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
in
the
family
home.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
the
application
of
the
statute
by
its
terms
should
preclude
the
father
as
well
from
living
in
the
home.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
john
moore
jr.,
who
is
now
age
ten
and
was
seven
at
the
time
of
the
prosecution,
was
singled
out
as
the
“illegal
occupant”
in
the
home.
he
is
the
one
who
was
being
asked
to
leave.
it
was
based
on
his
presence
in
the
home
that
–
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
mr.
john
moore
sr.
was
in
home
at
the
time
of
trial,
he
is
in
the
home
now
and
he
has
been
there
ever
since
trial.
the
composition
of
the
family
home
at
the
time
of
trial
was
mrs.
moore,
her
two
sons
john
sr.
and
dale
sr.,
and
their
two
respective
sons
john
jr.
and
dale
jr.
now
that
family
composition
has
remained
intact
in
exactly
the
same
way,
and
those
family
members
have
continued
to
live
in
the
home
to
this
date.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
it
is
beyond
me.
i
cannot
explain
that.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
i
did
not
try
the
case
below.
the
housing
code
singled
out
john
jr.
as
i
say,
the
notice
of
violation
--
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
there
was
a
coincidence
time-wise,
a
peculiar
coincidence
time-wise
with
john
jr.’s
entry
in
the
first
grade.
i
would
emphasize
this
ordinance
interferes
in
the
most
substantial
and
direct
way
with
matters
of
family
life.
for
example,
it
applies
to
all
dwelling
units
in
the
entire
city
of
east
cleveland,
ohio.
it
applies
to
single
family
units,
it
applies
to
two-family
units
and
multiple
dwelling
units
and
there
is
no
place
in
the
entire
city
of
east
cleveland
that
mrs.
moore
can
live
together
with
her
family.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
even
in
an
apartment.
east
cleveland
is
a
city
of
roughly
40,000
people
and
it
is
encompassed
within
about
a
3
square
mile
area.
and
the
criminal
sanctions
are
severe
as
well.
it
is
six
months
in
jail
for
every
day
that
a
violation
is
allowed
to
continue.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
in
a
sense
it
has
done
that,
although
not
in
those
terms.
its
past
two
ordinances,
one
which
sets
an
occupancy
limit.
for
example,
based
on-
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
yes,
i
do.
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
it
could
conceivably
have
an
impact,
although
that
is
clearly
not
the
purpose
of
the
ordinance.
let
me
use
the
example
that
east
cleveland
has
already,
well
the
ordinance
that
they
have
already
passed.
they
determined
in
a
mathematical
way
how
many
people
ought
to
live
--
how
many
square
feet
of
space
are
required
to
support
an
individual,
two
individuals,
etc.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
yes,
i
believe
that
is
valid.
in
this
case
for
example,
mrs.
moore
is
entitled
by
virtue
of
the
square
footage
in
her
home,
and
by
virtue
of
the
number
of
bedrooms,
to
have
seven
people
there.
she
has
always
had
less
than
seven
in
her
home.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
kind
of
ordinance
has
the
very
precision
that
this
ordinance
lacks.
the
problem
that
that
ordinance
is
addressing
is
the
problem
of
density.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
this
court
focuses
on
-
and
this
is
particularly
true
in
the
first
amendment
over-breadth
cases,
but
i
think
it
should
be
equally
true
here
-
is
on
the
substantiality
and
the
degree
of
impact
that
the
ordinance
has
on
the
particular
fundamental
right
involved.
and
that
ordinance
would
have
a
very
minimal
impact,
generally
speaking,
on
families.
if
it
is
properly
tailored,
if
indeed
the
legislature
sits
down
as
the
legislative
body
did,
for
example,
in
young
v.
american
mini
theaters
and
decides
that
this
particular
measure
is
key
to
the
problem.
the
impact
on
families
would
be
very
incidental
and
would
be
slight.
i
can
see
that
in
a
particular
situation
there
might
be
a
rather
severe
impact,
but
that
overall,
it
would
be
minimal.
and
i
think
that
the
other
key
distinguishing
factor
between
that
kind
of
ordinance
and
this
ordinance
is
its
very
precision.
there
is
nothing
precise
about
this
ordinance.
if
this
is
an
anti-overcrowding
ordinance,
where
is
the
relationship
if
you
cut
out
--
apparently
under
some
circumstances,
one
sub-group
of
grandchildren
may
live
in
the
home
provided
that
the
child
of
the
grandparent
is
dependent
upon
the
grandparent.
now
that
sub-set
might
have
several
children,
whereas
the
next
sub-set,
the
married
adult
child
who
is
separated
from
his
wife
and
returns
to
the
home,
that
child
is
automatically
out.
there
is
no
precision,
there
is
no
logical
relationship
between
this
particular
ordinance
and
the
control
of
density.
i
think
the
relationship,
if
it
exists,
is
purely
accidental.
i
think
that
that
is
the
distinction
between
the
two
kinds
of
ordinances
and
i
would
emphasize
that
east
cleveland
has
on
the
books
here
a
per-person
occupancy
limit
ordinance.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
he
goes
on
presumably—
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
presumably
what
happens
is
that
if—
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
i
think
if
john
moore,
jr.
is
forced
to
leave,
i
think
his
father
will
go
with
him
and
what
happens?
then
the
relationship
between
the
grandmother
and
her
own
son
is
disrupted
and
severed.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
about
income,
either
way.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
it
would
be.
it
is
only
relevant
in
so
far
as
the
statue
is
applied
to
--
,
in
so
far
as
the
dependency
question
is
involved
in
the
application
of
the
statute.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
that
is
absolutely
correct
in
this
instance.
let
me
emphasize
that
the
application
of
this
ordinance
here
would
not
only
sever
and
disrupt
the
relationship
between
mrs.
moore
and
her
own
son,
but
it
would
disrupt
the
relationship
that
is
established
between
young
john
and
young
dale
which
is,
in
essence,
a
sibling
type
relationship.
and
it
would
most
importantly
disrupt
the
relationship
between
young
john
and
his
grandmother,
which
is
the
only
maternal
influence
that
he
has
had
during
his
entire
life.
so
the
interference
here,
to
go
back
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question,
is
very
substantial.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
i
think
that
there
is
something,
perhaps
sacred
is
going
too
far,
something
very,
very
significant
in
our
society
and
in
history
about
blood
ties.
the
notion
of
kinship,
the
notion
of
sometimes
it
is
a
religious
obligation
to
look
out
for
your
own
kin.
that
is
what
is
at
work
here.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
yes,
i
would.
i
concede
that
in
a
given
situation,
the
reality
of
the
situation
might
approximate
the
same
kinds
of
blood
relationship.
but
it
really
is
different
and
i
am
not
asking
this
court
to
reach
that
--
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
i
am
sorry.
by
emphasizing
the
blood
ties,
i
did
not
mean
to
exclude
ties
of
marriage
and
ties
of
adoption.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
exactly,
and
there
is
very
clear
state
policy
along
those
lines.
if
this
ordinance
were
tailored
the
way
the
veltiere
ordinance
was
tailored,
obviously
we
would
not
be
here.
but
also
i
would
have
no
constitutional
objections
to
that
ordinance.
it
says:
all
persons
related
by
blood,
adoption
or
marriage.
and
then
it
is
up
to
the
family
members
to
decide
within
their
family
how
they
want
to
live.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
yes,
and
in
fact
such
a
per-space
requirement
has
been
passed
in
this
case.
it
is
quoted
in
part
on
page
3
of
the
appellant’s
brief.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
yes,
there
is
a
procedure.
within
ten
days
after
a
citation
by
the
housing
code
official,
there
is
a
right
to
appeal
for
a
variance.
the
standards,
but
i
would
emphasize—
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
the
record
does
not
show
either
way,
but
the
fact
is
that
no
appeal
was
taken.
i
would
emphasize
that
that
particular
ordinance
is
reproduced
in
the
appendix
to
the
appellee’s
brief.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
appellee’s
brief,
there
is
a
statement
that
had,
and
i
am
quoting,
had
mrs.
moore
sought
a
variance,
it
“probably”
would
have
been
granted
“possibly
with
some
stipulations”.
and
i
think
that
those
three
qualifiers
in
the
statement
by
the
appellee
are
born
out
by
any
examination
of
the
particular
variance
provision.
the
provision
permits
variances
provided
that
the
granting
of
the
variance
will
not
be
inconsistent
with
the
overall
purposes
of
the
ordinance
in
question.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
expect
east
cleveland
on
the
one
hand
to
grant
a
variance
for
mrs.
moore
if
it
is
saying
that
the
presence
of
john
moore,
jr.
in
the
home
is
in
fact
inconsistent
with
the
very
purpose
of
the
legislation.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
but
there
is
also
a
provision
in
the
variance
section
that
provides
that
if
it
is
to
be
granted,
it
must
be
granted
on
the
condition
that
it
is
consistent
with
the
overall
purposes
of
the
ordinance.
and
i
think
what
east
cleveland
does
in
granting
these
things
is
that
they
give
you
an
extension.
six
months,
a
year
and
then
you
have
to
leave.
we
will
give
you
a
variance
but
we
will
give
it
to
you
temporarily
for
six
months
or
a
year
and
then
you
have
to
go.
i
would
emphasize—
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
that
is
not
in
the
record.
that
is
based
on
my
own
examination
of
the
minutes
of
the
zoning,
the
appellate
review
unit
that
makes
these
decisions.
i
would
emphasize
that
it
is
correct,
mrs.
moore
did
not
seek
a
variance
in
this
case.
but
we
contend
that
that
is
constitutionally
irrelevant.
in
essence,
the
appellee’s
argument
is
that
there
was
some
requirement
of
exhaustion
of
the
administrative
avenue
here.
it
is
our
position
that
in
a
criminal
case,
it
is
not
a
precondition
to
asserting
an
offense
based
on
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
ordinance,
that
one
need
a
exhausted
variant
sort
of
administrative
appellate
procedure.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
there
is
a
legislative
history
but
it
does
not
illuminate
the
purpose
of
this
ordinance.
this
ordinance
was
passed
in
1961.
its
predecessor
was
passed
in
1961
at
the
time
a
housing
code
was
adopted
for
the
city
of
east
cleveland.
and
what
the
appellee
has
done
in
his
brief,
is
cite
the
prefatory
language
to
the
housing
code
which
talks
about
upgrading
property,
control
of
density
and
there
is
no
provision
that
zeroes
in
on,
by
way
of
explanation,
this
particular
provision.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
that
is
the
position
as
i
understand.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
five.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
by
the
terms
of
the
variance
ordinance,
you
must
file
an
appeal
within
ten
days.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
from
the
time
of
the
citation.
the
citation
occurred
in
january
1973,
roughly
a
year
or
so
prior
to
the
prosecution.
i
would
point
out
in
further
response
to
mr.
justice
steven’s
question
that
in
starr
v.
city
of
baxley,
355
us
313,
this
court
considered
the
question
of
whether,
reached
the
constitutional
validity
of
a
municipal
ordinance
that
precluded
persons
from
engaging
in
certain
kinds
of
organizational
activity
without
first
seeking
a
permit.
the
fact
was
that
the
individual
challenged
the
ordinance
did
not
seek
a
permit
in
that
instance
and
this
court
addressed
the
very
specific
question
whether
or
not
the
individual
somehow
lost
his
right
to
raise
the
question
before
this
court
by
failure
to
seek
a
permit.
the
court
rejected
that
decision.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
that
is
correct,
but
that
was
not
material
to
the
exhaustion
argument.
the
exhaustion
argument
was
that,
look
this
whole
case
could
have
been
avoided
-
if
you
simply
would
have
sought
a
permit,
it
might
have
been
granted.
and
that
point
was
specifically
addressed
by
the
court
and
rejected.
in
fact,
the
very
language
of
standing,
somehow
the
appellant
had
no
standing
and
that
case
is
adopted
by
the
appellee
in
his
brief.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
exactly.
at
this
time,
i
would
like
to
conclude
by
saying
that
this
court
is
presented
with
an
ordinance
which,
on
the
one
hand
exhibits
no
rational
methodology
whatsoever,
but
on
the
other,
cuts
ever
so
deeply
into
the
fabric
of
family
life.
we
urge
that
mrs.
moore’s
conviction
be
reversed,
that
she
be
allowed
to
live
together
with
her
sons
and
grandsons
in
east
cleveland,
unmolested
by
this
ordinance.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
few
minutes.
mr.
edward
r.
stege,
jr.
i
have
nothing
further
at
this
time.
thank
you.
