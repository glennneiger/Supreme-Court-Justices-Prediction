mr.
leonard
young
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
time,
the
appellee
would
like
to
point
out
that
with
respect
to
john
moore,
sr.,
the
housing
code
file
of
the
city
of
east
cleveland
shows
that
at
the
time
of
the
citation,
john
moore,
sr.
was
living
on
central
avenue
in
the
city
of
cleveland.
he
was
not
living
in
the
premises
in
question.
further,
we
would
like
to
point
out
again
from
the
appendix
of
appellee’s
brief
that
the
initial
citation
occurred
in
january
1973.
from
that
point
until
april
1974,
the
housing
department
of
the
city
of
east
cleveland
worked
with
the
appellant
in
trying
to
resolve
this
question
of
occupancy.
it
was
not
until
april
1974
that
this
matter
was
taken
to
court.
mr.
leonard
young
no.
your
honor,
the
procedure
with
respect
to
code
citations
are
to
notify
the
party
involved,
either
ask
them
to
call
the
housing
department
to
set
up
a
conferences
with
them
to
find
out
what
can
be
done
to
correct
the
situation,
including
conferences.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
but
i
can
only
make
this
point.
in
a
usual
situation
like
this,
the
housing
inspector,
if
there
is
a
possibility
of
a
variance,
would
make
a
verbal
response
to
that
person
involved
in
that
situation.
but
again,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
reflect
that
and
i
could
not
find
anything
in
the
record
of
the
housing
code.
mr.
leonard
young
if
i
may
go
to
that,
your
honor.
when
you
look
at
this
situation,
you
have
to
look
at
the
entire
housing
code.
one
of
the
things
that
i
focus
on
at
this
point
is
that
under
the
housing
code,
there
is
the
sub-tenant
(ph)
group.
they
are,
for
example,
and
i
take
exception
with
regards
to
hardships.
with
regards
to
a
variance,
a
showing
of
hardship
is
made
if
it
can
be
done
in
harmony
with
the
ordinance,
that
is,
to
maintain
the
safety,
the
welfare
of
the
community,
variances
are
granted.
in
this
situation,
the
record
does
not
reflect
it
and
to
my
knowledge
there
was
no
showing
of
any
need
or
any
hardship
as
to
why
the
grandson
should
remain
in
the
premises.
again,
i
go
back.
if
these
arguments
made
on
behalf
of
the
appellant
were
made
by
john
moore,
sr.
involving
personal
rights,
i
think
you
would
have
a
different
situation.
but
here,
you
have
the
appellant,
a
grandmother
making
these
arguments
of
personal
rights
in
which
there
is
no
guardianship,
no
adoption
on
her
part
of
john
moore,
jr.
therefore,
these
are
the
types
of
things
that
john
moore,
sr.,
as
a
natural
parent,
has
a
right
to
determine.
mr.
leonard
young
thank
you,
mr.
brennan.
if
we
go
back
again
to
the
citation,
i
mean
the
ordinance
in
question.
the
nominal
head
of
the
household,
in
this
case
would
be
the
appellant
-
she
is
listed
as
the
owner
of
the
premises,
can
have
one
unmarried
child
with
her.
also,
in
the
situation
says
he
had
a
son,
dale
sr.
was
there
and
dale
jr.
was
there.
looking
at
the
total
situation,
the
premises
could
accommodate
the
three
individuals
that
the
housing
department
would
not
give
a
citation
on
that
type
situation.
when
you
bring
in
john
jr.
who
is
there
at
that
point,
you
have
exhausted
the
ordinance
which
allows
the
unmarried
son
to
be
there.
you
are
bringing
on
another
family.
in
addition
to
that—
mr.
leonard
young
at
the
time
of
--
right.
i
do
not
know
that.
mr.
leonard
young
i
do
not
know
that.
possibly,
he
is.
but
again,
i
go
back
to
the
time
of
the
citation.
as
far
as
we
can
determine,
john
sr.
was
not
in
the
home.
now,
in
addition
to
this,
john
jr.
was
in
the
process
of,
as
counsel
for
appellant
pointed
out,
starting
to
school.
one
of
the
things
in
the
public
school
system
in
east
cleveland,
there
must
be
some
parent
or
person
who
stands
in
the
position
of
the
parent
to
whom
the
school
can
look
to,
if
there
is
a
need,
for
example
the
child
is
injured,
a
need
to
give
consent
for
treatment.
without
the
appellant
having
a
guardianship,
this
meant
that
they
cannot
turn
to
them.
mr.
leonard
young
unless
she
is
a
parent.
mr.
leonard
young
under
the
situation
where—
mr.
leonard
young
not
on
the,
in
my
understanding
they
could
not,
particularly
since
the
natural
father
is
alive
and
had
not
given
his
consent
to
the
grandmother
in
that
respect.
mr.
leonard
young
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
leonard
young
at
the
time
of
the
citation,
second
family
is
–
mr.
leonard
young
as
of
now,
there
is
a
second
family.
john
moore,
sr.
and
john
moore,
jr.
live
there.
mr.
leonard
young
two.
the
father
and
the
son.
they
are
there
now.
mr.
leonard
young
well,
your
question,
mr.
justice
marshall
was
as
of
now.
mr.
leonard
young
with
the
minimum
conflict-
mr.
leonard
young
mrs.
moore,
under
room
and
house
license,
could
apply
for
additional
roomers.
mr.
leonard
young
she
is
convicted,
your
honor,
the
conviction
is
for
having
more
than
one
family
in
the
premises
in
question.
mr.
leonard
young
as
to
person
at
the
time
of
the
citation
would
be
john
moore,
jr.
as
of
now,
since
currently
john
moore,
sr.
is
there,
it
would
be
john
moore,
sr.
and
john
moore,
jr.
mr.
leonard
young
as
of
the
time
of
conviction,
based
upon
the
stipulation
by
the
appellant,
john
moore,
sr.
was
there
also.
so
it
would
be
the
two
of
them.
mr.
leonard
young
citation
is
different,
your
honor,
between
conviction.
mr.
leonard
young
no,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
young
one,
the
father,
since
he
was
living
elsewhere,
your
honor,
could
take
the
child
himself.
mr.
leonard
young
may
i
continue?
mr.
leonard
young
i
would
not
go
to
that
extent,
your
honor.
second
thing
is
a
point
in
the
brief
is
that
if
the
appellant,
the
grandmother
had
a
guardianship,
john
moore,
jr.
would
be
part
of
her
immediate
family—
mr.
leonard
young
the
record
does
not
reflect
this,
your
honor.
i
can
assume
that,
my
thoughts
would
be
that
the
normal
procedure
here
is
that
they
are
told.
mr.
leonard
young
your
honor,
my
point
–
mr.
leonard
young
at
the
trial
in
question,
i
was
present.
after
the
conviction,
this
question
was
discussed
with
the
counsel
who
represented
appellant
at
the
trial
level.
this
was
discussed
in
my
presence
with
members
of
the
housing
department.
mr.
leonard
young
no,
it
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
young
i
understand.
mr.
leonard
young
i
would
like
to
expand
on
the
question
that
was
raised
when
the
appellant
was
present.
at
this
point
in
time,
and
even
after
the
conviction,
for
the
appellant
to
make
good
application
for
variance,
i
think
that
question
was
raised
and
i
would
have
to
submit
that
it
is
possible
even
after
the
conviction
for
the
application
for
variance
to
be
made.
mr.
leonard
young
i
might
address
myself
to
that.
first
of
all,
with
regards
to
the
fundamental
rights
issues,
if
we
look
at
all
of
those
cases
dealing
with
that
matter,
if
you
look
very
closely,
they
are
dealing
with
personal
rights.
the
right,
for
example,
of
a
person
to
vote,
this
is
personal.
the
right
of
the
female
to
determine
whether
she
will
procreate
-
again,
personal
rights.
there
is
no
law
that
counsel
knows
of
in
the
state
of
ohio
that
gives
a
grandmother
a
personal
right
to
decide
if
her
grandson
can
live
with
her.
mr.
leonard
young
the
right
of
association
in
line
of
case,
is
dealing
with
there,
again
i
would
focus
on
the
point
that
they
deal
primarily
with
relationship
between
what
we
call
the
nuclear
family.
again,
personal
rights.
the
right
to
associate
in
this
respect,
the
appellant
is
not
being
refrained
from
allowing
her
son,
grandson
to
stay
on
weekends.
or
even
she
-
under
the
two
systems
i
suggested
–
the
hardship
or
guardianship
–
to
actually
assume
full
responsibility
for
him.
i
might
point
out
that
under
the
equal
protection
argument
that
was
suggested
by
counsel,
that
in
equal
protection
situations,
the
ordinance
in
question
must
be
of
a
suspect
character.
there
has
not
even
been
any
argument
to
this
effect
or
raised
in
the
briefs
in
this
instance.
the
procedural
due
process,
no
proper
notice
was
given,
conferences
were
held,
in
this
respect
to
try
to
determine
how
best
to
resolve
this
matter.
mr.
leonard
young
no,
what
i
am
saying
is
in
a
suspect
classification
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
that--
mr.
leonard
young
with
regards
to
the
state
interest,
your
honor,
we
are
talking
here
of
overcrowded
conditions.
that
is
only
one.
there
is
the
problem
of
traffic,
tax
burdens
with
respect
to,
not
only
to
the
city
services.
mr.
leonard
young
yes
we
do,
your
honor.
the
density
ordinance,
with
respect
to
square
footage
and
density,
partly
covers
our
problem.
if
i
may
go
back
for
a
moment,
the
ordinance
sequence
was
passed
initially
in
1961
defining
family,
redefined
in
1964.
it
would
appear
that
this
legislative
body
at
that
point,
found
that
they
needed
something
additional,
the
two
ordinances
together
from
cooperating,
working
in
complementary
to
deal
with
these
three,
actually
four
problems:
overcrowding,
traffic
congestions
and
the
tax
burden
so
that
the
safety
and
the
welfare
of
the
city
is
handled
within
the
income
that
the
city
is
producing.
mr.
leonard
young
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor,
there
is
no
legislative
history
in
this—
mr.
leonard
young
’66,
that
would
be
the
beginning
of
it,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
young
yes,
certainly
your
honor.
in
fact,
we
would
suggest
rather
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
the
nuclear
family
that
the
city
commissioners
had
contemplated
in
passing
of
this
ordinance.
i
might
point
out
that,
under
the
provisions
or
the
definition
of
family,
that
under
proper
circumstances,
other
members
of
the
family
might
be
allowed
to
live
in
a
given
city,
a
given
home.
mr.
leonard
young
yes,
that
was
a
choice
that
the
appellant
could
have
made,
yes.
mr.
leonard
young
no,
i
would
not
say
the
grandmother
could
move
out.
she
was
the
owner
of
the
premises.
mr.
leonard
young
no,
as
long
as
she
is
the
owner,
i
would
not
think
it
would
be
–
mr.
leonard
young
your
honor,
i
would
agree
with
that.
however,
i
might
point
out
that
based
on
what
has
been
before
the
court
at
this
time,
you
have
dale,
sr.
and
john,
sr.,
the
appellant,
who
are
adults.
there
are
three
automobiles
there.
this
is
a
two-family,
at
least
two
adults
on
the
other
side.
mr.
leonard
young
one
of
you
asked
me
a
question
with
respect
to
traffic.
what
i
am
pointing
at
is
that,
in
a
home
where
there
is
a
two-car
garage,
you
might
have
as
many
as
five
automobiles
at
this
home.
and
i
am
focusing
on
the
fact
that
the
ordinance
was
aimed
at
more
than
just
a
question
of
overcrowdedness.
mr.
leonard
young
no,
i
would
not
–
mr.
leonard
young
she
can
only
have
one
unmarried
son
under
the
ordinance.
mr.
leonard
young
that
is
right.
mr.
leonard
young
she
could
have
--
one
unmarried
son
is
being
considered
part
of
--may
i
expand
that?
one
unmarried
son
is
considered
the
family.
the
second
son,
since
this
is
a
two-family,
would
be
there
as
what
we
call
under
the
ordinance
an
unlicensed
roomer.
mr.
leonard
young
i
am
sorry,
you
are
correct
in
that.
mr.
leonard
young
i
would
have
to,
under
that
factual
situation
–
mr.
leonard
young
in
this
case,
that
might
be
the
situation,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
younger
grandson
is
not
seven,
it
was—
mr.
leonard
young
no,
he
has
not.
mr.
leonard
young
--
was
the
appellant—yes.
mr.
leonard
young
there
would
be
a
problem
there
under
the
square
footage
ordinance.
mr.
leonard
young
well,
if
the
appellant
is
a
mother
of
12
children
--
mr.
leonard
young
if
under
the
ordinance
of
square
footage,
it
would
be
fine,
yes.
mr.
leonard
young
i
suppose
if
they
are
at
the
proper
age,
they
could.
mr.
leonard
young
with
regards
to
a
volkswagen
bus,
i
would
have
to
answer
this
on
the
basis
of
whether
it
is
classified
as
a
truck
or
not.
there
might
be
some
problem
with
regards
to
where
it
would
be
parked.
trucks
are
not
allowed
to
be
parked
in
the
residential
areas.
mr.
leonard
young
in
the
estin
(ph)
case,
it
is
“a”
factor,
it
is
not
“the”
factor.
again,
i
would
like
to
go
back
with
regards
to
the,
again,
the
tax
situation.
this
is
with
respect
to
the
income
generated
to
provide
services
for
the
city,
the
normal
services,
fire,
police
and
so
forth.
if
we
have
an
overcrowded
condition
on
the
basis
of
the
city’s
limited
income,
of
course,
you
are
going
to
reduce
the
ability
of
the
city
to
properly
provide
services
for
all
of
the
citizens
of
the
community.
i
might
point
out
that
with
regards
to
–
mr.
leonard
young
your
honor,
i
am
talking
about
taking
the
situation
with
the
case
we
have
at
hand.
in
effect,
again
i
realize
it
is
not
in
the
record,
but
in
effect
multiplying
the
situation
that
you
get
continued
overcrowded
situations
throughout
the
city
of
east
cleveland.
mr.
leonard
young
if
there
was
nothing
but
a
density
problem,
there
would
be
no
problem.
mr.
leonard
young
with
regards
to
this,
i
would
have
to
submit
that
that
is
the
situation
because
again
i
have
to
go
back.
john
sr.
initially
was
living
elsewhere
and,
assuming
he
was
employed,
he
was
paying
his
taxes
to
another
municipality.
yet
his
son
is
being
educated
in
the
east
cleveland
school
district.
in
the
situation
before
the
court,
the
appellant
is
challenging
the
state
interest
with
respect
to
the
passing
of
these
ordinances.
however,
it
is
submitted
on
behalf
of
the
city
of
east
cleveland
that
these
ordinance
rather
was
passed
on
the
proper
exercise
of
the
police
power,
that
it
is
rationally
related
to
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
enacted.
therefore,
in
order
to
raise
the
challenge,
the
appellant
has
the
obligation,
has
the
burden
to
show
by
clear
evidence
that
there
is
an
infringement
on
the
appellant.
and
i
submit
that
the
record
below
does
not
show
any
evidence
on
the
part
of
the
appellant
that
this
is
the
situation,
that
the
ordinance
is
not
rationally
related
to
its
purpose.
in
fact,
this
is
a
point
that
is
mentioned
by
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
in
affirming
the
decision
of
the
trial
court.
in
summation,
the
appellee
submits
that
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether,
when
a
city
can
properly
pass
a
municipal
ordinance
on
its
police
power
in
the
interest
of
the
welfare,
safety
of
its
community
provides
in
that
ordinance
means
by
which
the
appellant,
if
it
felt
harshly
could
have
gotten
a
variance,
and
the
appellant
does
not
make
an
effort
to
apply
to
the
appellate
route,
then
the
appellant
has
first
of
all
no
standing
before
this
court.
secondly,
since
there
is
no
record
to
show
that
the
appellant
presented
a
clear
evidence
that
this
ordinance
is
arbitrary,
the
court
should
sustain
the
judgment
of
the
ohio
state
appellant
district
affirmed
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
court
affirm
the
decision
below.
mr.
leonard
young
with
regards
to,
first
of
all,
i
do
not
know
the
facts
available
to
the
housing
inspector
at
the
time
of
the
citation.
mr.
leonard
young
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
your
honor,
the
appellant
simply
stipulated
that
these
five
individuals
were
living
there
and
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
leonard
young
no,
but
after
they
made
that
stipulation,
there
was
no
further
evidence
taken.
and
since
there
was
no
application
to
the
board
of
zoning
appeals,
i
do
not
know
whether,
there
was
no
application
made,
there
might
have
been
a
denial
or
it
may
have
been
granted.
i
really
do
not
know
in
this
instance
because
there
was
no
application
made
to
the
board
of
zoning
appeals
in
this
respect.
mr.
leonard
young
i
said
possibly.
this
is
what,
it
said
possibly
would
be
granted
with
probably
some
limitations.
mr.
leonard
young
i
really
do
not
know.
mr.
leonard
young
i
do
not
know
at
this
point
until
the
facts
are
presented
to
the
zoning
appeal.
mr.
leonard
young
no,
i
cannot
get
a
minimum
guarantee,
no.
thank
you
very
much.
