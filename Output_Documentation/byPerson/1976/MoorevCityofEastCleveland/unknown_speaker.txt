unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
there
is
an
over-breadth
test
applicable
when
you
get
outside
of
the
area
of
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
and
what
do
you
rely
on
for
that?
unknown
speaker
it
is
one
thing
to
say
that
the
statute
violates
the
right
in
question,
and
therefore,
it
cannot
stand.
it
is
another
thing
to
say,
as
i
think
of
the
term
“over-breadth”
to
me,
that
it
covers
areas
that
it
should
not
cover
so
that
even
though
it
does
not
violate
any
right
in
this
case,
we
are
not
going
to
let
it
apply
because
it
may
infringe
on
rights
in
other
cases.
which
meaning
do
you
adopt?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
family
members,
how
broad
does
that
term
sweep?
unknown
speaker
so
it
would
include
presumably
cousins?
unknown
speaker
suppose
this
ordinance
merely
said
that
anyone
not
related
within
the
third
degree
shall
not
be
regarded
as
a
member
of
the
family,
do
you
think
this
would
be
valid?
just
that.
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
conceding
there
is
a
cut-off
point?
unknown
speaker
--this
ordinance.
unknown
speaker
your
first
two
categories,
you
spoke
of
children.
this
ordinance
does
not
cut
against
children,
does
it?
if
your
client
could
have
13
children,
she
would
not
be
-
as
to
them
or
sidewise
with
the
ordinance,
would
she?
unknown
speaker
i
am
assuming
all
that?
unknown
speaker
it
was
not
your
position
at
an
answer
to
my
brother
blackmun
that,
if
a
family
decided
to,
well
we
are
going
to
be
a
tribal
organization
in
our
particular
family
–
the
jones
family
or
the
smith
family
–
we
are
going
to
be
tribal
rather
than
think
of
ourselves
as
organized
in
a
nuclear
family
or
anything
close
to
it,
that
the
state
would
be
constitutionally
required
to
recognize
that.
unknown
speaker
everybody
related
at
all,
like
most
of
the
population
in
the
hills
of
kentucky,
for
example.
unknown
speaker
why?
if
they
asserted
that
this
is
the
kind
of
family
we
want
to
belong
to,
and
these
are
associations
that
we
are
constitutionally
entitled
to
maintain,
then
the
state
of
ohio
and
the
city
of
cleveland
has
no
constitutional
right
to
invade
our
constitutional
right
of
association
as
a
tribal
organization.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
constitution
about
that?
unknown
speaker
nobody
is
being
denied
the
right
to
live
with
their
child
here,
unless
you
are
talking
about
the
grandmother’s
right
to
live
with
her
grandchildren.
unknown
speaker
in
a
particular
single
house,
in
a
single
dwelling.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
application
of
this
statute,
of
this
ordinance,
has
quite
an
effect
upon
the
father
living
with
his
children
in
the
home
of
the
grandmother.
it
cuts
across
that,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
if
you
and
your
opposition,
would
have
get
together
as
to
where
john
moore,
sr.
lived,
was
he
in
the
home
or
was
he
not
in
the
home?
as
i
read
your
brief,
you
have
opposite
polls
on
this.
unknown
speaker
it
is
an
awfully
small
point,
but
is
there
any
reason
why
john
jr.
rather
than
dale
jr.
is
the
villain
in
the
picture?
unknown
speaker
did
the
judge
suggest
why?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
schools
or
something?
is
that
suggested
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
even
in
an
apartment?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
city
of
east
cleveland
could
pass
an
ordinance
that
said
there
shall
be
no
more
than
three
people
per
room
permanently
residing
in
any
single
family
dwelling?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
can—
unknown
speaker
that,
but
such
an
ordinance
though,
it
would
certainly
have
a
fairly
sharp
impact
on
even
a
nuclear
family.
wouldn’t
they
have
wanted
to
have
a
lot
of
children?
unknown
speaker
and
would
that
be
valid?
unknown
speaker
but
could
you
not
attack
that
ordinance
on
the
grounds
that
it
could
conceivably
interfere
with
the
decision
as
to
a
nuclear
family
–
mother,
father,
children
–
as
who
want
to
have
a
lot
of
children
and
say,
instead
of
passing
that
kind
of
ordinance,
they
ought
to
pass
the
kind
of
ordinance
that
you
are
attacking
here
that
does
not
have
any
effect
on
the
nuclear
family
but
just
cuts
it
off
at
the
nuclear
family.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
that
prevents
this
if
this
fellow,
a
young
man
that
is
in
trouble,
if
he
goes
out
does
he
go
on
home
relief
or
something?
on
welfare?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
that
is
what
the
city
wants.
unknown
speaker
well
i
assume
that
a
seven-year
old
child
cannot
take
care
of
himself.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
shows
that
he
has
an
independent
income.
unknown
speaker
there
is
nothing
about
income
at
all.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
meant.
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
relevant
to
this
issue?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
if
they
do
not
have
any
money
at
all,
then
the
child
may
be
thrown
out
in
the
street?
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
on
that
argument,
would
the
case
be
any
different
if
the
grandfather
had,
say
had
his
first
wife
die
and
remarried
someone
who
was
not
actually
the
maternal
grandmother
but
ye
brought
up
the
children?
would
it
be
really
a
different
case?
is
it
really
dependent
on
the
blood
relationship
or
just
the
fact
that
these
five
individuals
happen
to
live
together?
unknown
speaker
you
would
say
that
would
be
a
different
case,
in
other
words.
unknown
speaker
but
would
this
be
different
if
john
sr.
was
the
adopted
son
of
the
grandmother
and
john
jr.
was
in
turn
the
adopted
son
of
john
sr.?
i
am
puzzled
by
why
you
put
so
much
on
the
blood
relationship
once
the
legal
relationship
is
established.
unknown
speaker
adopted
children,
for
almost
every
purpose
that
i
can
conceive
of,
are
treated
the
same
as
natural
issue,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
then
to
prevent
the
overcrowding
you
say
that
the
municipality
may
put
a
density,
a
space
requirement.
but
that
you
would
accept
because
presumably
it
relates
to
health
and
safety.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
does
this
ordinance
have
any
provision
for
individual
variances?
is
there
any
procedure
by
which
you
could
have
applied
on
behalf
of
the
family
for
a
tolerance
or
something?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
whether
that
was
done
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
follow
it.
any
variance,
by
definition,
assumes,
there's
a
violation
of
the
literal
general
application
of
the
ordinance,
doesn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
support
that
or
is
that
just
sort
of
a
--
?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
legislative
history
which
tells
us
the
purpose
of
this
ordinance?
unknown
speaker
because
this
is
a
suggestion
that,
in
addition
to
the
specific
density
provision
or
ordinance,
this
also
has
a
purpose
related
to
density?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
i
think
you
told
us
the
seven-room
house
,
or
rather
the
house
in
any
event,
could
within
the
density
ordinance,
accommodate
seven
people.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
there
are
only
six
here.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
law
in
ohio
that
says
if
you
are
charged
with
violation
of
the
zoning
code,
you
cannot
after
that
time
be
given
a
variance?
does
that
prevent
you
from
getting
–
unknown
speaker
from
the
time—
unknown
speaker
was
it
not
the
holding
in
starr
that
the
very
statute
that
required
the
permit
was
bad?
unknown
speaker
if
the
municipality
has
no
authority
to
put
this
kind
of
a
limitation
based
on
other
than
density,
then
the
variance
falls
in
the
same
category.
unknown
speaker
both
sons
were
married.
unknown
speaker
is
john
sr.
unmarried?
unknown
speaker
a
grandmother
cannot
do
that—
unknown
speaker
i
am
a
grandparent.
i
would
like
to
think
i
could.
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
is,
they
could
not.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
city
is
not
the
school
district,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
want
this
young
man
to
go?
the
only
complaint
is
one
boy,
right?
is
that
the
complaint?
unknown
speaker
as
of
now,
what
is
the
complaint?
unknown
speaker
one
person?
one
person,
too
many?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
on
his
constitutional
plan,
your
friend’s
position
is
that
the
municipality
has
no
right
to
require
them
to
ask
for
a
variance,
that
this
right
exists
independent
of
that.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
right
of
association?
is
that
personal?
unknown
speaker
mr.
young,
before
you
say
it,
i
would
like
to
hear
you
talk
about
what
state
interests
are
served
by
this
ordinance?
what
legitimate
state
interests
or
purposes
does
this
ordinance
promote?
unknown
speaker
you
have
a
separate
ordinance
on
density,
don’t
you?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
legislative
history
that
indicates
what
the
council
had
in
mind
when
it
devised
an
ordinance
that
prevents
a
grandmother
from
living
with
her
children
and
grandchildren?
unknown
speaker
mr.
young,
is
it
conceivable
that
the
city
council
might
have
been
willing
to
allow
more
people
per
square
foot
in
a
house
if
it
was
a
nuclear
family
than
if
it
was
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
young,
let
met
be
sure
about
this.
another
solution
to
the
dilemma
here
would
have
been
for
dale
sr.
and
dale
jr.
to
move
out.
unknown
speaker
the
grandmother
could
move
out
or
would
have
to
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
on
your
traffic
congestion,
you
said
only
one
kid
did
not
have
a
license.
unknown
speaker
if
they
are
all
legitimate,
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
neither
dale,
sr.
nor
john,
sr.
had
these
two
boys,
dale,
jr.
and
john,
jr.
there
would
be
no
problem
even
though
each,
the
grandmother
and
the
sons
each
had
a
car.
unknown
speaker
there
would
be
no
violation
of
the
ordinance
if
just
the
appellant
and
her
two
sons
lived
in
the
house,
would
there?
unknown
speaker
even
though
neither
had
any
children?
unknown
speaker
the
mother
could
have
only
one
of
her
children
to
live
with
her,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
what
if
they
are
both
unmarried
and
neither
has
a
child,
aren’t
they
alright?
can
they
not
stay
with
their
mother?
as
i
read
the
definition
of
family
in
134108---
unknown
speaker
get
back
to
my
--
question.
and
if
neither
dale
jr.
nor
john
jr.
had
been
born,
and
john
sr.
and
dale
sr.
lived
with
their
mother
and
each
had
an
automobile,
there
would
be
no
violation
of
the
ordinance
notwithstanding
the
traffic
problem
that
it
might
have
created,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
it
is
only
because
these
two
seven-year
old
grandchildren
are
there.
and
the
three
automobiles
become
a
traffic
hazard.
unknown
speaker
whatever
it
is,
it
does
not,
as
justice
marshall
suggested,
it
is
sill
not
a
license
(inaudible)
or
is
he?
unknown
speaker
a
mother
with
six
children
would
be
okay.
unknown
speaker
well
suppose
--
unknown
speaker
there
would
be
no
problem
there.
how
about
more
than
12?
unknown
speaker
that
would
depend
on
the
size
of
the
building.
unknown
speaker
if
one
had
12
children
in
a
14-room
house,
it
would
be
fine,
right?
unknown
speaker
so
the
reason
is
to
cut
down
the
density
and
the
traffic
problem.
oh,
incidentally,
could
all
those
children
have
a
car?
unknown
speaker
could
each
one
of
them
have
a
volkswagen
bus?
in
the
same
way,
what
about
a
truck?
unknown
speaker
certainly
mr.
young,
you
are
trying
to
charge
them
with
just
“a”
factor,
is
it
not?
it
is
not
“the”
factor.
unknown
speaker
i
am
sorry,
i
do
not
think
i
followed
it.
how
does
this,
i
gather
the
way
this
would
work
is
one
father
and
son
would
have
to
leave
in
order
to
satisfy
the
ordinance,
is
that
right?
or
i
suppose
one
of
the
grandchildren
would
have
to
leave
this
house
in
order
to
satisfy
the
ordinance.
how
does
that
alleviate
the
tax
burden?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
it,
if
there
were
nothing
but
a
density
problem
here,
there
would
be
no
overcrowding.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
in
this
house,
there
would
be
no
overcrowding.
but
now
the
way
it
is,
with
the
two
grandchildren
and
there
is
an
overcrowding
and
this
somehow
increases
the
cost
of
police,
fire
and
other
services?
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
young,
before
you
sit
down,
you
made
a
point
and
i
asked
the
question
before
about
the
availability
of
an
appeal
to
the
other
side,
that
she
could
have
asked
for
a
variance.
does
that
not
work
both
ways?
why
couldn’t
the
city
of
east
cleveland,
when
they
found
out
the
facts
that
do
not
seem
to
be
very
extreme,
why
couldn’t
they
have
simply
withheld
prosecution
here?
why
should
the
burden
be
on
them
when
you
have
a
situation
like
this,
trying
to
get
a
seven-year
old
boy
out
of
the
house?
unknown
speaker
but
they
surely
were
at
the
time
of
trial,
weren’t
they?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
evidence
taken
at
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
if
you
express,
you
are
sure
it
would
be
good.
or
did
i
read
you
wrong?
unknown
speaker
probably.
possibly,
you
say.
but
you
said
it
would
probably
be
granted.
well
would
it,
or
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
you
really
do
not
know?
unknown
speaker
as
of
now,
you
do
not
know.
