justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
appellant,
mrs.
inez
moore,
lives
in
her
home
in
east
cleveland
ohio
with
her
son
and
two
grandsons
who
are
first
cousins
rather
than
brothers.
a
city
passing
ordinance,
limits
the
occupancy
of
dwelling
units
to
members
of
a
single
family.
but
underneath
now,
a
definition
of
family,
mrs.
moore's
household
does
not
qualify.
as
a
result,
the
city
ordered
her
to
remove
one
grandson
from
her
home.
when
she
failed
to
comply,
she
was
charged
with
a
violation
of
the
ordinance
convicted
and
sentenced
to
five
days
in
jail
and
a
$25.00
fine.
the
city
defends
this
restrictive
definition
of
the
family,
excluding
grandchildren
when
they
are
cousins
on
conventional
zoning
grounds,
that
is
population
congestion,
traffic
safety
and
the
like.
but
we
perceive
no
basis
in
light
of
these
objectives
for
defining
families
so
narrowly
as
to
deprive
grandchildren
of
their
privilege
of
living
with
their
parent
and
grandmother.
the
institution
of
family
is
deeply
rooted
in
our
country's
history
and
tradition.
that
tradition
is
not
limited
to
the
nuclear
family.
decisions
of
this
court
long
have
recognized
a
constitutional
liberty
interest
in
certain
family
rights.
the
justices
rejoined
me
in
the
plurality
opinion
find
no
justification
for
the
severe
limitation
this
ordinance
imposes
upon
family
associations.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
ohio
court
of
appeals.
the
plurality
opinion
i
have
filed
is
joined
by
mr.
justice
brennan,
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
joined
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
justice
stevens
had
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
mr.
justice
white
have
each
filed
dissenting
opinion,
mr.
justice
stewart's
opinion
being
joined
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
