is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
here
mr.
wells
as
to
whether
this
retailer
ran
a
totally
what
you
might
call
adult
bookstore
or
whether
he
had
an
adult
section
and
non-adult
section?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
hard
to
fail,
hard
to
fail
in
your
proof,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
on
its
face,
the
material.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
law
indicates
which
comes
here
from
the
california
state
court,
the
petitioner
was
convicted
in
california
state
court
on
a
misdemeanor
charges
selling
obscene
films.
as
proposed
of
the
evidence,
the
jury
was
instructed
that
it
could
consider
the
circumstances
of
production
and
dissemination
of
the
material
in
assessing
the
social
importance
and
thus,
the
ultimate
obscenity
of
the
material.
petitioner
in
this
court
challenges
this
instruction
alleging
that
it
unconstitutionally
allowed
the
jury
to
consider
conduct
by
persons
other
than
the
defendant
in
deciding
whether
the
material
was
obscene.
he
also
contends
that
the
instruction
was
a
violation
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause
because
it
was
given
pursuant
to
a
state
statute
which
went
into
effect
after
the
offense
was
committed.
we
reject
both
of
these
contentions
and
affirmed
the
conviction.
the
circumstances
of
the
materials
production
and
dissemination
are
relevant
to
the
obscene
character,
the
material
itself
that
are
constitutionally
admissible
even
if
involving
persons
other
than
the
defendant.
we
also
accept
the
view
of
the
california
court
of
appeals
that
state
law
authorized
the
use
of
such
an
instruction
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
statute
relied
upon
by
the
petitioner.
there
was,
therefore,
no
violation
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
