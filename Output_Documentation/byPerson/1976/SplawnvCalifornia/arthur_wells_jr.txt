mr.
arthur
wells,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
here
because
the
petitioner
has
been
convicted
for
violation
of
california
obscenity
law.
facts
are
quite
simple.
in
1969,
the
petitioner
ran
a
store
in
northern
california
from
which
he
sold
books
and
films
with
sexual
contents.
prior
to
the
events
that
occurred
which
led
to
the
conviction,
the
police
had
become
aware
of
the
store
and
it
purchased
material
for
sale
regularly
in
the
store
but
apparently
none
of
this
material
was
the
type
that
they
felt
was
suited
for
prosecution.
so,
they
sent
in
someone
who
was
a
part-time
policeman
and
otherwise,
a
carpet
layer
who
was
seeking,
in
his
words,
hardcore
material
which
--
by
which
--
mr.
arthur
wells,
jr.
no,
i
--
i
don't
think
it
--
the
issue
of
whether
its
obscenity
is
out
of
the
case.
i
didn't
raise
the
issue
of
whether
the
material
was
obscene
or
not
because
as
i
understand
miller,
the
only
question
asked
to
the
content
of
the
material
is
whether
or
not
it
is
the
type
that
is
--
that
could
be
found
by
properly
instructed
jury
to
be
obscene.
the
two
films
here
graphically
display
ultimate
sexual
acts,
they
are
not
simulated.
and
therefore,
they
are
the
type
that
could
be
found
obscene
if
the
jury
were
properly
instructed.
in
this
case,
we
claim
that
evidence
was
improperly
introduced
and
that
the
jury
was
not
properly
instructed
and
that's
why
there
was
a
conviction,
but
it's
because
of
the
holding
in
miller
that
we
have
not
raised
at
this
point
a
claim
as
to
the
content
for
the
material.
i
might
also
point
out
that
the
term
hardcore
as
used
in
this
case
by
the
participants
was
not
a
concession
that
the
material
was
obscene
but
only
that
the
material
graphically
displayed
ultimate
sex
acts.
in
other
words,
in
1969
and
1970,
the
state
of
the
art
was
what
was
publicly
for
sale
was
simulated.
that
is
borne
out
by
the
record
and
i
would
refer
you
to
pages
515
through
517,
574,
619,
683
and
684
and
762
in
which
all
of
the
people
who
had
anything
to
do
with
the
store
and
mr.
drivon,
the
policeman,
indicated
that
they
were
talking
about
material
which
actually
showed
sex
acts
rather
than
which
showed
simulated
sexual
acts.
in
any
event,
drivon
in
order
to
accomplish
the
test
of
acquiring
some
hardcore
material,
some
material
which
graphically
displayed
sexual
behavior
which
require
to
make
six
contexts
with
the
store,
only
one
of
those
contexts
was
with
the
petitioner,
mr.
splawn,
and
i
think
it
is
significant
that
at
that
context,
the
petitioner
told
mr.
drivon
that
he
could
go
to
san
francisco
and
get
these
films
himself
if
he
wish
and
mr.
drivon
begged
off
from
that
invitation.
finally,
then
after
six
contexts,
drivon
purchased
two
films
for
$70
for
which
petitioner
was
convicted.
he
had
been
tried
not
only
for
the
crime
of
displaying
and
distributing
obscene
material
but
also
on
the
felony
conspiracy
charge
with
his
twin
brother
and
the
clerk
and
there
was
an
acquittal
on
the
felony
charge.
at
the
trial,
certain
instructions
were
given
which
were
based
on
ginsberg
versus
united
states
and
our
common
law
would
referred
to
as
instructions
that
our
based
on
the
pandering
doctrine
and
there
were
other
instructions
which
i
will
discuss
the
content
of
more
specifically
later.
in
any
event,
the
case
presents
three
issues.
the
first
issue
arises
because
the
pandering
law
of
california
which
was
incorporated
into
instructions
was
not
in
effect
at
the
time
that
the
defendant
or
the
petitioner
sold
films
for
which
he
was
subsequently
convicted.
mr.
arthur
wells,
jr.
no,
you
did
not
grant
cert
on
that
issue
and
i
did
not
brief
that
issue
in
the
brief
and
i
do
not
intend
to
address
myself
to
that
question.
you
limited
your
grant
to
certiorari
to
the
first
four
questions.
because
the
law
was
not
none
in
effect
at
the
time,
an
ex
post
facto
which
it
was
raised.similarly,
the
california
supreme
court
less
than
two
years
before
the
sale
which
is
the
subject
matter
to
this
lawsuit
had
ruled
that
pandering
was
not
part
of
california
law,
and
therefore,
a
question
arises
under
the
due
process
clause
and
bouie
versus
columbia
as
to
whether
there
was
a
new
and
novel
and
unfair
application
of
state
law
to
this
defendant
such
that
he
was
denied
due
process.
the
behavior
engaged
in
by
the
--
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case
displays
no
more
than
a
simple
sale
and
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
which
is
here
in
question,
refers
to
no
behavior
by
the
petitioner
except
that
of
a
simple
sale.
under
the
circumstances,
the
question
is
raised
about
whether
the
pandering
instructions
both
based
on
the
law
and
as
given
by
the
court
in
this
case
should
have
been
given
at
all
because
in
the
petitioner's
view,
these
instructions
are
lopsided.
they
do
not
fairly
represent
the
proposition
for
which
they
supposed
to
support
instead
they
represent
only
a
prosecution
view.
third,
on
the
assumption
that
it
was
properly
give
instructions
on
the
subject
of
the
contexts
in
the
behavior
rather
than
just
on
the
subject
matter
of
the
material,
of
course,
it
is
presented
as
to
whether
these
instructions
are
proper.
now,
i
would
like
to
discuss
these
matters
in
reverse
order.
i
think
miller,
if
it
teaches
us
one
thing,
says
that
local
juries
and
local
jurisdictions
are
going
to
have
a
lot
more
to
say
about
what
is
and
what
is
not
obscene.
this
court
sits
not
to
find
what
is
obscene
but
just
as
it
check
to
determine
what
is
not
obscene.
i
think
if
you
are
going
to
have
rules
which
say
that
you're
going
to
have
a
not
completely
defined
local
community
as
the
community
by
which
the
judge
was
obscene.
and
if
you're
going
to
have
a
rule
that
requires
no
evidence
at
all
except
the
material
itself,
they
introduce
to
support
a
conviction
in
what
you
have
to
insists
on
is
properly
instructed
jury.
i
urge
this
court
to
elaborate
on
and
adopt
its
recent
remarks
in
footnote
11
of
marks
versus
u.s.
which
is
to
the
effect
that
there
is
no
substitute
for
properly
instructed
jury.
i
think
this
especially
important
in
a
case
like
this
because
what
we're
talking
about
is
the
content
of
books
and
movies
and
other
material,
which
by
the
way
is
pure
speech,
this
isn't
picketing
case,
this
isn't
an
o'brien
situations,
this
isn't
anything
but
pure
speech.
and
i
think
what
we're
talking
about
is
questions
of
aesthetics,
questions
of
taste
and
questions
of
social
value
and
we're
trying
to
convey
to
a
group
of
layman
what
it
is
that
they
have
to
do
to
make
a
judgment
which
can
rise
to
a
level
of
constitutional
judgment.
now,
i
think
then
that
what
we
need
is
as
much
clarity
and
precision
as
we
can
get.
otherwise,
we
have
no
insurance,
the
jury
is
located
someplace
else
and
without
the
necessary
guidance
of
any
evidence
with
the
material
itself
and
applying
a
local
community
is
going
to
do
what
you
nine
people
wanted
to
do
or
what
--
a
larger
group
than
that
wanted
to
do.
therefore,
i
think
it's
very
important
to
stick
to
what
we
have
if
that's
what
we
have
to
live
with.
now,
the
worst,
the
most
glaring
example
of
error
i
think
are
the
instructions
as
given
is
the
instruction
that
says
that
the
jury
is
permitted
to
look
to
the
sexually
provocative
aspects
of
the
matter
to
determine
if
the
material
lacks
value.
now
if
they
find
the
material
is
sexually
provocative,
that
fact
alone
is
enough
to
find
that
the
material
lacked
value.
this
to
me
is
an
extremely
insidious
instruction
for
the
following
reason.
the
core
thing
in
the
obscenity
field,
the
thing
that
has
been
with
us
since
roth
is
the
notion
of
prurience.
if
there
is
any
governmental
interest
at
all
in
--
in
this
field,
if
there
is
any
reason
for
the
states
to
be
in
it
at
all,
it
is
only
because
this
material
on
some
theory
or
supported
by
some
set
of
facts
is
harmful,
is
unhealthy
and
that's
what
prurience
means.
prurience
indicates
this
obsessive
compulsion
with
the
unhealthy
aspects
of
sex.
provocativeness
is
an
entirely
different
thing.
provocativeness
has
to
do
with
arousal,
being
aroused,
being
excited,
being
provoke
and
that
is
not
necessarily
unhealthy.
now,
what
happens
is
this.
prurience,
as
far
as,
i
can
see
is
a
difficult
concept.
it's
a
difficult
term
because
you're
dealing
of
health
and
lack
of
health
in
a
large
community
of
people
who
you
have
to
judge
it
by.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
layman,
the
common
juror
is
acquainted
with
the
term
prurience,
uses
it
or
things
in
terms
of
those
notions.
on
the
other
hand,
provocativeness
especially
sexual
provocativeness
is
something
that
we
all
grow
up
with.
chewing
gum,
cars,
there
is
nothing
that
is
not
sold
partially
on
the
basis
of
provocativeness
and
usually
sexual
provocativeness.
cigarettes
for
years
were
sold
with
implied
--
and
still
are
in
billboards
but
not
on
television,
implied
sexual
attractiveness
from
smoking.
i
therefore
think
that
what
happens
if
you
permit
the
type
of
instruction
given
here
and
what
indeed
probably
did
happen
here
is
that
the
jury
says
to
itself,
but
we're
supposed
to
deal
with
this
notion
of
prurience
but
i'm
not
too
sure
what
it
is.
and
under
miller,
maybe
we
don't
have
any
evidence
regarding
it
but
the
judge
said
something
about
provocativeness,
maybe
i'll
look
at
it
and
see
if
i
think
it's
provocative.
if
it's
provocative,
then
i
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
rest
and
so
they
substitute
provocativeness
or
a
judgment
about
whether
the
material
is
provocative
for
a
judgment
about
whether
the
material
is
prurient.
and
that
is
the
worst
possible
thing
that
can
be
done
in
this
field
for
the
reason
that
the
only
reason
for
having
the
rules
about
obscenity
if
there
are
any
reasons
is
that
the
material
is
unhealthy.
and
if
the
judgment
is
made
on
the
basis
of
provocativeness
rather
than
prurience,
then
you're
not
making
the
judgment
on
the
basis
of
the
material
is
unhealthy
but
just
that
it
excites
or
arouses
somebody.
and
the
fact
--
the
fact
that
something
arouses
or
excites
somebody
is
probably
one
of
the
reasons
why
it
should
have
first
amendment
protection,
not
one
of
the
reasons
that
it
shouldn't.
and
of
course
the
other
thing
about
the
term
sexual
provocativeness
is
that
it's
vague.
vague
in
both
the
senses
that
it's
not
final
enough
that
we
can
draw
a
line
so
that
we
can
protect
--
protected
speech
and
not
protect
--
not
protected
speech
and
vague
in
the
sense
that
you
are
using
the
term
can't
tell
me
what
i'm
supposed
to
do
and
so
i
don't
have
any
real
notice
about
what
i'm
supposed
to
do
and
the
jury
has
no
real
notice
about
what
its
supposed
to
do.
the
other
fundamental
area
in
the
instruction
--
and
the
instructions
in
this
case
was
the
instruction
which
permitted
the
jury
to
look
again
at
the
material
after
it
supposedly
applied
the
three
tests
which
at
that
time
we
have
to
pull
a
memoir's
test
and
judge
it
in
terms
of
the
intent
of
the
creator.
whatever
maybe
the
value
of
such
a
test,
it
has
never
been
applied
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
a
retail
seller.
hamling
was
a
producer,
ginzburg
was
a
producer,
rebhuhn,
who
in
1940
was
the
person
about
whom
learned
hand
wrote
the
opinion
which
you
said
was
a
good
opinion
in
ginzburg,
was
the
man
who
mailed
out
--
made
and
mailed
out
the
flyers
in
that
case
and
its
never
been
applied
to
a
person
in
any
event,
the
man
isn't
on
trial.
that
is
to
say
the
--
the
publisher
is
not
on
trial.
so
what
you
do
is
you
look
again
at
the
material
and
you
say,
“well,
what
is
the
intent
of
the
person
who
made
this
material?”
now,
that
should
never
be
the
judgment
about
whether
the
material
is
obscene
or
not
because
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
get
to
an
objective
standard.
we
are
trying
to
apply
a
standard
which
is
a
standard
of
lack
of
health,
unhealthiness,
and
the
motives
of
the
creator
are
not
what
we're
talking
about
when
we're
talking
about
prurience.
if
you
want
to
get
the
creator
of
the
material,
then
you
use
the
investigative
facilities
to
go
arrest
him
and
--
on
this
type
of
theory.
i
supposed
you're
trying
for
something
like
attempt
to
make
a
dirty
book
or
attempt
to
make
obscene
books,
then
you're
talking
solely
about
his
--
his
motives.
under
this,
you
have
a
subjective
standard
instead
of
an
objective
standard
and
once
again,
it
redefines
any
of
the
tests
laid
down
by
this
court
and
because
it's
easier
for
the
jury
to
apply
that
kind
of
a
test,
just
look
at
the
--
we
know
what
he
was
trying
to
do,
then
they're
going
to
substitute
that
test
for
the
law.
now,
the
next
point
is
a
question
about
whether
these
instructions
should
have
been
given
at
all.
to
this
extent,
i
think
ginzburg
is
a
confusing
case.
what
happen
in
ginzburg
is
that,
there
was
a
holding
that
context
was
important,
but
the
context
to
that
case
was
that
a
publisher
exploited
his
materials.
and
the
question
is,
whether
you're
going
to
have
a
rule
which
permits
the
context
to
be
considered
or
not.
in
this
case,
what
--
what
california
did,
is
first
of
all,
would
pass
a
statute,
they
didn't
say
consider
the
whole
context.
it
said,
see
if
the
guy
is
misusing
the
material,
and
i
admit
that
was
part
of
ginzburg
verus
united
states,
but
that's
only
because
of
the
facts
of
ginzburg
which
were
entirely
different
from
the
facts
here,
mainly
because
you
have
a
publisher
and
control
there
and
you
don't
have
one
here.
here,
what
you
have
is
a
retailer
and
if
you
don't
limit
the
rules
somehow
and
let
him
know
what
he
can
do
and
not
do,
there
is
no
way
he
is
going
to
have
any
idea
and
i
think
its
really
going
to
leave
to
a
self--censorship
thing,
merely
putting
--
mr.
arthur
wells,
jr.
there
is
no
direct
evidence
in
the
record.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
he
did
run
an
adult
bookstore,
the
pictures
that
were
introduced
as
the
matter
--
exhibit
four
which
were
introduced
on
a
pandering
theory
show
the
inside
of
the
store
and
they
show
magazines
displayed
in
their
covers.
i
would
urge,
i
am
reading
over
my
brief,
i
see
that
--
well,
i
complained
a
lot
that
the
conviction
was
improper.
i
did
not
suggest
what
would
be
an
appropriate
rule
and
i
think
the
object
--
the
court's
opinion,
if
its
reaches
this
issue,
should
be
to
limit
the
application
of
this
rule
if
you're
going
to
have
it
at
all
to
a
very
finite
definite
set
of
circumstances
because
otherwise
in
a
field
where
i
feel
that
you're
at
your
limits
of
possible
use
of
words
to
be
able
to
convey
ideas,
you
just
can't
go
any
further.
now,
i
would
point
out
that
ginzburg
permitted
the
use
of
this
doctrine
as
a
rebuttal
tool,
quickly
--
strictly
a
question
in
that
case
or
it
could
be
read
to
be
are
the
integrity
of
the
process.
ginzburg
had
been
out
in
middlesex
and
blue
ball,
pennsylvania,
going
crazy
with
this
material
and
it
wasn't
a
material
itself,
he
was
exploiting
it,
okay.
and
then
he
run
into
court
and
said,
“oh,
this
is
really
pure
stuff.”
now,
as
a
mere
factual
rebuttal
to
that,
the
government
said,
wait
minute,
you
said
one
thing
out
there
just
to
show
that
you're
not
credible,
that
you're
not
to
be
believed,
a
different
thing
should
be
permitted
to
be
shown
here.i
would
urge
you
to
limit
the
application
of
the
rule
to
that.
if
you're
not
going
to
do
that,
if
you're
going
to
go
further,
then
i
would
say
that
you
should
limit
a
behavior
which
is
unambiguous
exploitation
because
what
you
have
to
do
is
draw
the
distinction
between
commercial
exploitation
and
commercial
behavior.
if
you
don't
permit
some
behavior
in
this
field,
then
you're
going
to
cut
out
everything
out.
people
are
not
going
to
do
anything
in
this
field.
now,
i
would
--
the
only
good
analogy
i
can
think
of
and
it
isn't
really
right
on
point,
just
to
refresh
your
recollection
about
the
clear
and
present
danger
test,
that
is
the
other
test
that's
used
to
determine
if
protected
speech
should
not
be
protected
because
of
the
context
in
which
it's
used.
here,
if
you've
got
material
which
is
borderline
or
material
which
is
not
--
which
the
government
apparently
doesn't
feel
it
can
be
made
obscene
without
reference
to
the
context
and
therefore,
it's
going
to
use
the
context,
the
question
should
be
whether
the
behavior
of
the
defendant
was
such
that
that
it's
clear
and
immediate
that
there
was
exploitation
of
the
unhealthy
aspects
of
the
material
rather
than
support
of
the
material
that
has
value.
you've
had
these
kinds
of
rules
before
and
to
go
not
too
far
field,
that
is
to
stand
a
criminal
law
field,
i
point
out
to
you
that
you
have
a
warrant
requirement
and
that
you
require
warrants
to
go
into
premises
unless
you
have
exceptions.
and
the
exceptions
are
only
that
wide.
the
one
i
think
of
that's
useful
here
is
the
exigent
circumstances.
in
order
to
get
around
the
warrant
by
saying,
a
one
requirement
by
saying
exigent
circumstances
permitted
us
not
to
get
the
warrant,
the
behavior
has
to
be
clear
and
ambiguous.
there
are
hosts
of
--
court
of
appeals
cases
still
holds
in
wong
sun
for
instance
as
i
recall
it
is
a
case
where
the
man
knocking
on
the
door
or
the
policeman
knocking
on
the
door
and
footsteps
are
running
away
and
that's
still
held
to
be
ambiguous
and,
therefore,
not
a
sufficient
exigent
circumstance.
here,
you
should
require
a
specific
unambiguous
act
which
you
had
in
the
case
as
it
had
been
before
you.
you
have
specific
advertising
which
have
--
which
have
emphasized
the
prurient,
fallacious
aspects
of
material,
sort
of
to
formulate
such
a
rule
doesn't
require
you
to
withdraw
a
cutback
or
overrule
any
cases.
lastly,
i
would
address
myself
to
the
issue
of
--
to
the
ex
post
facto
issue.
i
think
the
key
here
is
the
question
of
what
does
this
pandering
rule
do
to
a
natural
trial
of
an
obscenity
case
and
i
think
its
rather
clear
that
it
fundamentally
changes
the
focus
and
that
it
makes
the
whole
different
ball
game
than
you
would
have
when
you
just
look
at
the
four
corners
of
the
material.
the
government
and
the
court
of
appeals
tend
to
treat
this
as
a
rule
of
evidence
and
--
and
i
think
that
that's
just
putting
a
label
on
something
and
i
don't
think
its
doing
--
i
don't
think
it's
solving
the
problem.
there
are
a
lots
of
different
kinds
of
evidence
rules.
there
are
evidence
rules.
it
shift
the
burden
of
proof
to
deal
with
the
burden
of
who
has
to
go
forward
and
not
deal
with
the
quality
of
evidence,
some
kinds
of
judgments
can
be
made.
oh,
you
have
to
have
percipient
evidence,
other
kinds
you
have
to
have.
i
mean
hearsay
is
adequate.
there
are
probably
are
couple
where
double
hearsay
would
be
adequate.
there
are
rules
of
evidence
that
cover
who
can
give
evidence
and
who
can't
give
evidence.
but
a
rule
that
actually
defines
what
is
material
in
a
given
case
is
that
kind
of
rule
of
evidence
that
is
a
substantial
contributor
to
--
to
the
parameters
of
the
trial.
for
instance,
if
you
change
the
rule
of
evidence
to
permit
the
question
--
well,
if
you
use
narcotics,
then
it
might
be
relevant
in
a
custody
case.
if
you
change
the
rules
of
evidence
in
a
breach
of
contract
case,
it
permit
evidence
that
someone
used
narcotics
on
the
theory
that
people
use
narcotics
or
less
likely
to
perform
contracts.
that
would
be
a
change
in
a
rule
of
evidence
that
seemed
to
me
to
be
material
enough
that
you
couldn't
apply
it
retroactively.
here,
i
think
there
was
a
clear
change
which
was
a
big
surprise
because
of
people
versus
noroff
which
by
my
view
the
california
supreme
court
clearly
said,
“we
are
not
going
to
have
a
pandering
rule
unless
a
legislature
passes
it.”
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
there
were
no
questions.
mr.
arthur
wells,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
arthur
wells,
jr.
yes,
i
have
a
brief
rebuttal
which
will
be
shotgunned,
for
which
i
apologize.
the
reference
in
the
record
to
the
statement
where
mr.
splawn
told
mr.
drivon
he
could
go
up
and
get
them
himself
is
at
page
338.
and
i
don't
think
don
splawn's
acquittal
means
anything
because
the
very
large
issue
in
this
case
was
the
issue
of
entrapment.
mr.
drivon
was
in
constant
contact
with
don
and
i
think
that
provides
one
reason
and
the
general
rule
is
one
finds
all
reasons
in
favor
of
a
judgment
that
should
apply
in
this
case.
as
i
understand
california
law,
there
is
a
case.i
think
it's
called
sheer
versus
municipal
court.
i'm
sorry
i
do
not
have
the
citation,
which
holds
that
where
a
publication
has
discreet
and
i
use
that
to
mean
separate
and
not
in
its
other
meaning
--
items,
you
can
look
at
any
one
of
the
items
to
determine
relevant
constitutional
test
or
statutory
test
for
obscenity,
and
if
so,
the
material
can
be
found
obscene.
sheer
ran
the
berkeley
barb
and
that's
why
i
recall
that's
the
case.
i
could
get
that
citation
if
you
wished.
therefore,
it
would
be
my
view
that
in
the
time
magazine
case,
if
there
was
one
obscene
picture
or
one
picture
that
could
--
that
had
the
qualifications
which
you
suggest
that
might
have,
the
magazine
could
be
found
obscene
and
a
noroff
motion
wouldn't
save
it.
i
think
the
noroff
motion
--
these
cases
arrive
mostly
in
the
municipal
court.
and
what
happens
is
that
in
california,
you
don't
have
any
preliminary
type
hearing
to
get
rid
of
the
chase
like
you
would
with
a
felony.
you
don't
have
a
preliminary
hearing.
in
the
noroff
motion,
it's
frankly
a
substitute
to
get
rid
of
the
stuff
that
shouldn't
be
going
to
trial
at
all.
now,
i
don't
think
you
can
characterize
this
rule
fairly,
these
pandering
rules
as
merely
evidence
rules,
because
what
they
are,
they're
part
now
of
the
definition
in
california.
i
will
say,
however,
that
under
the
holding
in
marks
versus
united
states,
i
think
that
mr.
splawn
will
always
be
entitled
to
roth
memoirs
standards,
and
i
think
for
him,
they're
constitutional
standards.
hamling
is
an
entirely,
as
i
read
what
you
quoted
in
hamling,
an
entirely
different
set
of
instructions
which
were
much
fairer.
there,
the
court
said
if
it's
a
closed
case,
look
at
all
of
the
circumstances.
and
didn't
say
anything
about
sexual
provocativeness,
and
didn't
say
anything
about
the
motives
of
the
creator.
and
i
will
say
that
while
the
distinctions
between
producers
and
creators
may
not
be
significant,
the
point
was
that
ginsburg
was
on
trial
for
behavior
that
he
did,
and
hamling
was
on
trial
for
behavior
that
he
did,
and
splawn
is
on
trial
for
what
the
creator
did,
and
there's
no
connection
between
them.
mr.
arthur
wells,
jr.
yes,
there's
a
general
instruction.
what
happened
is
this
was
covered
in
the
--
everything
was
gone
through
in
chambers,
and
then
there
was
a
general
blanket
instruction.
the
matter
was
covered
by
the
court
of
appeals
specifically,
and
i
think,
therefore,
all
of
these
issues
are
before
you
because
under
jenkins
versus
georgia,
it
hadn't
been
raised
below
and
the
fact
that
it
was
considered
by
the
court
was
deemed
adequate.
i
would
leave
you
with
this
point.
for
the
very
reasons
that
he
suggests
that
there's
evidence
of
pandering
in
this
record
is
the
very
reason
why
you
have
to
formulate
a
rule
limiting
it.
this
is
a
case
where
a
policeman
had
asked
four
or
five
times
for
hardcore
material,
and
then
because
mr.
splawn
said,
“hey,
you
know
i
can
get
in
trouble
for
this
stuff.”
that
statement
is
now
being
used
to
say
that
he
pandered
the
material
when
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
drivon
wanted
the
material
already,
but
the
sale
unaffectedly
had
been
consummated
even
though
the
money
hadn't
changed
hands,
and
what
was
perfectly
obvious
that
it
was
a
nervous
seller
who
wasn't
usually
doing
this
and
that
what
he
was
doing
was
just
trying
to
urge
the
guy
not
to
spread
it
around.
it's
not
evidence
of
pandering
and
any
set
of
rules
that
permits
it
to
be
used
as
such
is
an
unfair
set
of
rules.
thank
you
very
much.
