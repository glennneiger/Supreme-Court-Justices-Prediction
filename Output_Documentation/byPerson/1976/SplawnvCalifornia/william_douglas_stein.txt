mr.
william
douglas
stein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
william
stein
representing
the
people
of
the
state
of
california
in
this
obscenity
prosecution
an
area
in
the
law
which
i
submit
we've
all
probably
written
in
red
way
too
much.
i
believe
that
petitioner's
argument
today
is
based
on
an
erroneous
premise
and
that
is
that
he
has
been
convicted
somehow
of
advertising
or
promoting
the
sale
of
obscene
matter.
it's
true
that
california
recognizes
an
offense
of
that
nature
but
petitioner
was
not
charge
nor
convicted
of
that.
he
was
convicted
simply
of
the
act
of
selling
obscene
material.
at
trial,
the
prosecution
introduced
evidence
of
the
circumstances
of
the
production
and
dissemination
of
these
two
films
as
material
on
the
question
of
whether
they
were
obscene
under
the
--
then
roth
memoirs'
definition
of
obscenity,
a
definition
under
which
the
prosecution
and
the
juries
of
california
still
labor.
now,
petitioner
clever
way
of
phrasing
this,
he
uses
the
--
he
refers
to
this
evidence
of
dissemination
and
production
as
evidence
of
pandering
and
then
argues
that
the
instructions
relating
it
to
the
definition
of
obscenity
resulted
in
his
conviction
of
--
for
pandering,
a
crime
with
which
he
claim
--
which
he
was
not
charged
concededly.
i
submit
that
we
can
establish
that
the
jury
was
not
confused
in
this
manner
very
simply.petitioner
was
not
charged
alone.
petitioner
had
a
twin
brother,
don,
who
was
with
the
same
offense
and
in
a
matter
of
fact,
on
all
of
the
occasions
when
mr.
drivon
went
to
the
bookstore
to
talk
about
purchasing
these
films
as
petitioner
pointed
out
a
few
minutes
ago,
he
talked
mainly
with
don,
and
don
was
charged
with
selling
obscene
material.
don
was
acquitted.
the
evidence
that
petitioner
refers
to
is
pandering.
it
was
mainly
the
statements
of
don,
but
jury
was
going
to
be
confused
and
somehow
thought
that
this
evidence
made
it
a
crime
to
pander.
they
would
have
convicted
don
along
with
roy,
but
the
twin
brother
don
was
acquitted.
why?
because
the
jury
understood
exactly
what
the
judge
told
them.
the
evidence
only
went
to
the
issue
of
social
value,
one
of
the
three
definition
elements
of
obscenity
in
california
at
that
time.
selling
obscene
material
is
a
simple
crime.
it
has,
as
i
see
it,
only
two
elements,
the
knowing
sale
of
obscene
matter.
all
of
this
other
evidence
goes
to
the
three
definitional
requirements
of
obscenity.
so,
we
submit
the
petitioner
was
convicted
solely
of
the
act
of
selling
obscene
films
and
if
by
using
this
phrase
pandering
is
a
verb,
he
attempts
to
distract
us
from
this
very
simple
fact.
i
believe
that
after
all
these
years
there
were
little
confusion
between
the
parties
as
to
what
the
facts
in
the
case
were.
i
think
there
is
general
agreement
and
i
only
had
one
think
that
struck
me
during
the
petitioner's
argument
and
that's
when
he
said
that
the
defendant
told
mr.
drivon,
the
officer,
purchased
the
films
that
if
he
really
wanted
these
films
you
can
go
san
francisco,
get
them.
i'll
refer
to
the
transcript,
the
page
--
of
trial
page
37,
lines
24
through
26.
question
to
mr.
drivon,
mr.
drivon
talking
about
the
conversations
he
had
states.
he,
referring
to
the
twin
brother
don,
did
suggest
that
if
i
was
in
a
real
hurry
to
obtain
some
films
that
he
could
go
to
san
francisco
to
get
them.
i
submit
the
reference
is
not
that
he,
mr.
drivon,
did
go
to
san
francisco
but
then
if
they
was
in
a
real
big
hurry,
don's
plan
would
be
willing
to
satisfy
him
by
going
to
san
francisco
about
30
miles
up
the
road
to
get
these
films
and
bring
them
right
back.
it
would
made
it
of
course
made
no
sense
for
mr.
drivon
to
go
to
san
francisco
since
the
bookstore
here
was
in
the
suburban
community
in
california
or
(inaudible)
community,
san
mateo
county
and
that's
where
the
prosecution
was
attempting
to
limit
the
distribution
of
this
material.
okay,
the
brief
also
states
that
the
petitioner
makes
point
of
the
fact
that
mr.
drivon
had
to
come
back
again
and
again
as
though
he
was
the
moving
force
in
this
and
was
somehow
entrapping
if
you
will
the
petitioner.
but
if
any
--
if
you
read
the
record
and
every
one
of
those
inferences,
everytime
he
comes
back
there's
more
of
them,
the
more
pandering
is
done
by
the
defendant,
this
petitioners
or
his
brother
and
his
employee.
i
think
an
answer
to
what
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question
i
want
to
point
out
there
was
an
additional
exhibit
here
consisting
a
41
photograph
that
was
taken
of
the
interior
of
bookstore
at
the
time
the
arrest
was
made
which
establishes
the,
sort
of
the
nature
of
the
place
where
this
activity
was
taking
place
where
the
statements
as
to
the
films
were
being
made
which
was
evidenced
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
that's
correct.
redwood
city
is
a
county
city.
okay,
this
is
important.
there
are
two
procedures
that
happened
during
the
trial
which
i
think
is
very
important
to
the
outcome
of
the
case.
before
the
trial
was
made,
before
the
trial
has
happened,
petitioner
made
the
non--statutory
motion
recognizing
california
under
people
versus
noroff
to
have
the
case
dismissed
on
the
grounds
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
these
films
were
not
obscene.
the
motion
was
denied.
the
case
went
to
trial.
at
the
close
of
prosecution's
case,
defendant
made
a
motion
under
our
statutory
provision
for
a
directive
verdict
of
acquittal
on
the
specific
grounds
and
the
reference
to
this
is
in
the
transcript
at
page
495,
that
there
had
been
no
evidence
introduced
that
these
films
lack
social
value.
that
motion
was
also
denied.
the
reason
being,
of
course
of
the
prosecution
had
introduced,
evidences
recorded
recognizing
ginzburg
is
probative
on
the
definition
elements
of
obscenity
as
they
were
laid
down
at
the
time
it
brought
memories.
because
the
evidence
of
production
and
dissemination
is
relevant
to
this
definition,
the
jury
was
instructed
that
in
determining
whether
the
films
were
utterly
without
redeeming
social
importance,
and
as
a
sideline,
i'd
like
to
say
most
of
this
evidence
and
all
of
this
instruction
went
to
social
importance
as
opposed
to
appearing
in
appeal.
okay,
whether
they
could
consider
the
circumstances
of
sale
and
distribution,
particularly
whether
such
circumstances
indicated
these
films
were
commercially
exploited
by
petitioner
for
the
sake
of
their
apparent
appeal.
they
were
informed
such
evident
--
evidence
was
probative
with
respect
to
the
nature
of
the
films
and
can
justify
the
conclusion
that
they
were
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value.
the
weight
of
any
of
the
evidence
of
course
was
left
to
the
jury
specifically
instructed.
now,
the
jury,
with
respect
to
social
importance
of
sexual
provocativeness
in
point
petitioner
made
during
his
oral
argument,
the
jury
was
further
instructed
that
evidence
of
the
circumstances
of
production
and
dissemination
were
relevant
for
determining
whether
social
importance
claim
for
the
film
was
in
the
circumstances
pretense
the
reality.
and
if
they
concluded
that
the
purveyor
sole
emphasis,
sole
emphasis
was
on
the
sexual
provocative
aspect
of
these
films,
that
fact
could
justify
the
conclusion
that
the
matter
was
utterly
without
redeeming
social
importance.
roy
splawn
was
not
trying
to
sell
lucky
strike
cigarettes
or
anything
else
by
having
a
pinup
girl.
he
was
making
the
--
the
purveyor
was
the
sole
emphasis
on
the
sexual
aspects
of
these
films
that's
recognized
as
irrelevant
to
social
value
and
that's
how
the
jury
was
instructed
here.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
i
do,
yes.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
no,
they
concluded
that
that's
correct,
if
they
concluded
that
his
sole
emphasis
was
on
the
sexually
provocative
aspect
of
the
film,
it
could
justify
the
conclusion
that
it
was
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value.
that
was
the
way
they
were
instructed
again.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
i
think
it
is.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
i
think
it
is
in
the
sense
that
this
case
where
they
were
further
instructed
of
course
that
as
into
the
roth
memoirs
definition
that's
--
i
don't
want
to
bore
the
court
by
rereading
roth
memoirs,
but
it
--
that
they
had
to
find
lack
of
social
importance
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
i
think
taken
all
together
in
its
entire
scope
the
instructions
read
together,
i
don't
think
they
were
allowed
or
disallowed
them
to
just
look
to
it,
nothing
else
find
lack
of
social
value
but
i
don't
know
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
okay,
now
i'm
focusing
on
your
problem.
sure,
and
that
would
not
be
a
proper
statement
of
the
law.
we
would
all
agree
to
that,
but
that
cannot
happen
in
california.
and
the
reason
that
that
cannot
happen
in
california
is
time
magazine
with
a
single
picture
in
it
that
maybe
provocative
or
what
else
would
never
survive
a
noroff
motion
which
was
made
here.
you
see,
time
magazine
or
many
at
most
material
in
this
area
falls
into
one
of
three
categories.
it's
either
obscene
as
a
matter
of
law
and
i
can't
think
of
an
example
but
i'm
sure
there's
some
or
it's
constitutionally
protected
which
time
magazine
would
be
and
in
which
case
the
motion
made
here
under
noroff,
that's
why
that
procedure
was
important
to
remember,
would
block
the
prosecution.
you'd
never
get
pass
that
first
motion.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
clearly
not
obscene,
clearly
protected,
i
think
that's
important
to
remember
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
by
definition,
that's
what
we
have
here
at
least
--
at
least
that
because
in
california
mr.
william
douglas
stein
not
only
do
you
have
to
assume
and
i
think
you're
bounded
and
you
have
to
because
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
--
under
the
california
procedure
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
that's
correct
but
as
you
point
out,
--
that's
correct
as
to
social
importance
of
the
material,
true.
but
no
matter
how
salacious
or
how
outrageous
the
pandering
of
the
material
is
as
you
point
out,
roth
memoirs
requires
two
other
elements,
but
it'd
be
beyond
customary
limits
of
canner
in
the
community
and
it
appealed
the
prurient
interest,
both
of
which
have
to
be
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
so,
i
think
taken
the
instructions
together,
it's
an
appropriate
statement
of
the
law.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
oh,
sure.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
that's
correct
and
the
jury
was
specifically
instructed
that
this
instruction
only
went
to
the
social
value
not
to
the
prurients
of
the
material.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
he
can't
make
a
prurient
by
telling
you
it's
prurient.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
that's
correct.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
each
of
the
three
parts
of
the
test
are
question
for
the
jury
and
unlike
the
federal
system
and
before
i
came
here,
i
tried
to
read
that
instruction
given
in
hamling,
i
couldn't
find
that
for
my
contacts
but
i
did
talk
to
the
u.s.
attorney
in
southern
california
who
had
an
instruction
that
they
give
in
similar
case
that
should
be
it
was
quote
and
i
know
this
right
away,
that
the
issue
of
close
case
under
the
federal
instructions
is
a
strictly
a
jury
questions.
it
is
strictly
a
jury
question.
we
show
the
film
or
whatever
and
we
put
in
all
of
this
ginzburg
evidence
and
everything,
and
we
leave
it
to
you,
not
so
under
california.
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
get
pass
that
noroff
motion.
it
has
to
be
unprotected.
you
know,
by
the
matter
of
law,
it
has
to
be
outside
the
first
amendment,
then
we
go
to
the
jury,
okay?
in
the
federal
system
and
that's
the
instructions
that
were
affirmed
in
hamling.
as
i
understand
it,
it
goes
to
the
jury
and
then
you
tell
them
to
look
at
the
evidence
and
look
at
the
ginzburg
test,
and
if
you
can't
resolve
these
three
things
from
the
face
of
the
material
itself,
then
you
can
look
to
this,
and
then
you
look
this
evidence
of
dissemination
and
production
and
you
come
out
with
an
answer
at
the
end.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
no,
he
has
to
rule
that
the
material
is
outside
the
protection
of
the
first
--
no,
he
has
to
rule
--
yes
it
is
--
the
matter
is
then
he
making
--
no,
he
has
to
dismiss
the
prosecution
if
the
material
is
not
obscene
as
a
matter
of
law.
right.
it
is
a
matter
of
law
and
that
test
of
course
comes
up
again
and
it's
that
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
no,
the
defense
may
be
able
to
show
that
although
the
matter
is
outside
the
first
amendment,
the
didn't
treat
it
in
the
manner
which
renders
it
within
the
ginzburg
of
the
roth-memoirs
definition
of
obscenity.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
not
at
all
because
if
it's
only
picture
in
the
magazine,
the
prosecution
wouldn't
get
over
the
noroff,
i
accept
it
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
well,
then
we
go
--
then
we
go
on
appeal,
he's
entitled
to
the
same
standard
as
the
trial
judge
has
to
use
under
noroff
to
review
the
material
on
appeal
and
as
i
understand
it
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
nobody's
entitled
to
raise
it
on
appeal
as
though
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
yes
and
he's
entitled
to
one
more
before
he
gets
to
appeal
which
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
the
censorship?
mr.
william
douglas
stein
yes
we
are
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
we
are
censoring
material
that's
outside
the
first
amendment
in
california
and
we
would
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
we
would
intend
to
do
that.
the
--
any
--
but
i
don't
think
it's
important
to
remember.
he
gets
another
bite
at
the
apple.
after
the
prosecution
puts
all
its
evidence
in,
he
made
the
statutory
motion
to
acquit
for
failure
of
the
proof
and
that
was
denied,
and
that's
reviewable
on
appeal,
yeah.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
yes,
oh
yes.
i
don't
think
the
--
i
think
the
evidence
was
relative
and
it
was
probative
as
recognized
in
ginzburg
and
maybe
even
before.and
it's
so
that
the
statute
merely
recognizes
the
relevance
of
the
evidence.
all
relevant
evidence
was
inadmissible
in
california
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
--
prior
to
that.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
no,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
in
which
they
were
given
prior
to
this.
one
way
or
the
other,
i
have
not
tried
--
i've
not
been
active
in
the
trial
of
obscenity
cases,
only
in
the
appellate
level
and
after
this
event.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
it's
probative
on
the
definition
of
the
roth-memoirs
definition
of
obscenity,
yes.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
sure.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
i
disagree
with
that
reading
of
noroff
and
i'll
leave
it
to
your
--
to
read
it
and
analyze
it
yourself.
but
basically,
i'll
tell
you
what
happened,
as
it
was
matter
--
it
was
protected
as
a
matter
within
the
first
amendment
as
a
matter
of
law
was
prosecuted,
okay?
and
the
california
prosecutor
said,
“united
supreme
court
has
come
down
with
ginzburg
which
allows
us
to
bootstrap
this
material
out
of
the
first
amendment,
into
area
of
obscenity
because
of
the
way
this
fellow
pandered.
and
california
says,
“you
might
be
able
to
do
that
in
california
if
you
had
the
same
statute
that
the
federal
government
has
which
you
have
a
statute
about
advertising
in
the
mail
statute,
advertising
and
pandering
a
matter
as
obscene.
but
in
california,
we
didn't
have
that
statute.
they
said,
absent
that
statute,
there's
no
way
you
can
get
protected
material
up
into
or
out
of
the
first
amendment
down
into
the
area
of
obscenity
on
the
use
of
this
evidence,
so
they
threw
it
out.
then
the
trial
judge's
motioned
--
the
trial
judge's
dismissal
of
the
prosecution
was
affirmed
in
people
versus
noroff,
thus,
leading
to
the
non-statutory
motion
that's
made
in
every
obscenity
case
since
that
this
indictment
here
has
to
be
dismissed
because
the
matter
is
protect
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
yes.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
right.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
no,
i'm
afraid
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
--
yes
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
no.
the
--
the
noroff
decision
says
that
if
the
matter
is
within
constitutional
protection
within
the
first
amendment,
there
can
be
no
prosecution
in
california
because
there
is
no
statute
that
allows
prosecution
for
the
advertising
of
non-obscene
matter
as
obscene.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
no,
because
the
predicate
of
noroff
is
that
the
material
is
non--obscene,
entitled
to
first
amendment
protection,
okay?
here,
that
is
not
the
fact
and
the
first
amendment
protection
cannot
be
lost
by
pandering
evidences.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
that's
right
and
if
this
material
was
within
the
first
amendment,
pandering
evidence
could
not
have
been
admitted.
we
couldn't
even
get
passed
the
motion
to
dismiss
stage,
well
because
it's
outside
and
i
don't
believe
noroff
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
sure
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
--
and
that's
the
point.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
here's
the
point,
pandering
evidence
can't
convict
the
defendant
of
a
crime
he
didn't
commit.
the
only
crime
here
is
selling
obscene
matter.
the
pandering
evidence
goes
to
whether
the
matter
is
obscene
or
not.
maybe
i'm
not
being
myself
--
i
realize
i'm
not
getting
crossed,
but
it
doesn't
--
we
didn't
make
a
crime
that
didn't
exist.
selling
obscene
matter
has
been
a
crime
in
california
as
far
as
back
as
i
could
trace
in
the
statutes.
he
knew
that
selling
obscene
matter
was
--
what's
he's
saying
is
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
oh
the
function
that
it
plays
is
you
have
recognized
the
difficulty
of
placed
on
the
prosecution
by
roth-memoirs
to
prove
a
negative
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
prosecutor
has
to
prove
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
we
could
all
say
and
if
i
was
trying
the
case
again,
i
might
say,
“well,
these
films
are
so
bad,”
but
i
don't
need
any
other
evidence.
roll
the
projector
and
i'll
make
an
argument
to
the
jury,
but
the
prosecutor
is
faced
with
the
problem
and
he's
lost
10
of
these
in
a
row
and
he's
got
this
bookstore
down
in
redwood
city
and
he's
going
to
say,
“well,
i'm
going
to
try
the
best
i
can,”
and
ginzburg
says
this
evidence
is
relevant
and
utterly
redeeming
on
the
test
of
obscenity
as
to
other
social
value
and
i'm
going
to
take
the
whole
shot
i
can.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
but
unfortunately,
california
still
labors
under
that
roth-memoirs
test.
under
miller,
this
would
not
be
a
problem.
we
believe
that
the
--
you
have
recognized
in
hamling
that
the
instruction
was
properly
given
in
a
pre--miller
federal
prosecution,
we'd
ask
for
the
same
consideration
of
the
state
prosecutors
who
still
toil.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
no,
the
evidence
came
in
on
the
case-in-chief
on
direct
and
in
the
matter
fact,
the
only
--
the
defense
moved
that
the
close
of
the
case.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
that's
correct
of
social
values.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
that's
where
you
have
to
put
it
in,
right.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
and
the
close
of
the
people's
case
if
we
have
not
proven,
that
we
have
not
--
but
at
least
raise
the
jury
issue
on
social
value,
his
motion
to
dismiss
would
have
been
granted
and
we'd
be
--
well,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
no,
we
still
recognize
as
this
court
recognize
that
the
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
as
long
as
the
projector
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
the
projector
bulb
doesn't
fail,
we
usually
do.
we
have
a
prima
facie
case.
petitioner
pointed
out
and
it's
a
point
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
this
court
decides
obscenity
cases
not
merely
to
rule
upon
the
alleged
obscenity
of
the
material
but
to
guide
lower
federal
courts,
state
courts,
legislators,
and
prosecutors.
in
miller,
you
recognize
the
difficulty
of
the
burden
has
been
placed
on
us
under
the
roth-memoirs
test.
you
recognized
in
ginzburg
that
this
kind
of
evidence
is
relevant
to
that
test.
we
still
have
it
in
california.
we're
not
about
to
get
rid
of
it
apparently.
we
believe
we
were
entitled
to
produce
the
evidence,
given
the
--
given
these
instructions
in
which
you
recognize
is
proper
in
hamling,
which
we
think
is
fine.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
that's
state
statutory
law.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
yes,
there
are
statutes
that
were
periodically
reacted
following
this
court's
decisions
and
it
stopped
at
roth-memoirs,
and
it's
been
hung
there.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
excuse
me?
mr.
william
douglas
stein
it's
all
in
the
magazine
business,
yes.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
they're
instructed
though
that
they
have
to
find
the
material
--
i
mean
i
could
read
--
i'll
read
the
whole
thing,
but
the
material
taken
as
a
whole
must
be
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
and
they
would
find
under
that
instruction
that
it
was
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value?and
then,
could
they
say,
taken
as
a
whole.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
it
goes
to
social
value.
i'm
not
sure
that
they
could
say
it
was
taken
as
a
whole
but
even
if
they
could,
they
have
to
still
find
taken
as
a
whole
that
it
appeals
to
prurient
interest
and
taken
as
a
whole
goes
beyond
the
customary
limits
of
candor
in
the
community,
except
(inaudible)
the
community.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
see,
the
bible,
--
let's
say
the
bible
cannot
be
elevated
out
of
the
--
i
hate
to
--
it's
a
negative
we're
talking
about.
it
can't
be
removed
from
the
first
amendment
and
made,
somehow,
obscene
no
matter
how
he
portrays
it
or
how
he
tells
me.
what
he
tells
me
this
thing
is,
because
it's
a
three-part
test,
and
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
the
work
taken
as
a
whole.and
these
instructions
went
just
to
the
evidence
of
dissemination
and
production.
now,
as
far
as
the
fact
that
the
--
that
mr.
splawn
was
not
the
creator,
i
doubt
that
hamling
created
the
photographs
that
he
put
together
and
assembled
in
this
thing
and
disseminated
it.
hamling
was
the
disseminator,
ginzburg
was
the
disseminator.
roy
splawn
is
the
disseminator.
the
creator
of
the
material
motives
are
important
to
determining
whether
that
material
is
what
it
purports
to
be.
i
took
a
few
minutes
off
the
other
day
and
went
down
to
the
hirshhorn
museum.
when
you
stand
in
front
of
the
pictures,
what
comes
to
kind?
you're
trying
to
think,
“what
is
the
intent
of
the
creator
of
this
picture?”
the
intent
of
the
--
the
creator
himself
doesn't
have
to
be
here
on
trial.
we've
got
the
film.
you
can
look
at
the
films.
they
were
created
by
him.
what
was
his
intent?
that's
important
to
determining
the
social
value
of
that
material,
what
he
was
intending
to
do.
roy
splawn,
his
testimony,
he
made
a
phone
call.
he'd
seen
the
movies.
he
knew
what
was
in
them.
and
so,
i
think
the
fact
that
roy
splawn
didn't
create
the
movies,
there's
no
evidence
that
he
did.
it
doesn't
preclude
giving
these
instructions,
or
preclude
the
prosecution
from
using
this
evidence.
i
think
it's
important
too
to
point
out
that
the
jury
was
never
instructed
that
they
could
substitute
this
evidence
for
any
of
the
definitional
requirements
of
roth
memoirs.
they
were
instructed
that
the
purveyor's
emphasis
was
on
the
sexually
provocative
aspects
of
the
film.
the
motive
of
the
creator
was
an
appeal
to
sexual
curiosity
and
appetite
by
animating
sensual
detail
as
to
give
the
film
a
salacious
cast,
that
that
was
evidence
that
the
films
were
obscene
but
they
were
never
instructed
they
could
jerk
that.
if
we
can't
understand
the
roth
memoirs
test,
we'll
just
junk
that
and
we'll
go
to
his
evidence.
that's
not
in
those
instructions,
barely
written.
they
merely
advised
the
jury
that
the
evidence
of
the
circumstances
of
production
and
dissemination
were
probative
with
respect
to
petitioner's
claim
of
redeeming
social
value
and
could
justify
the
jury's
conclusion
that
his
claims
were
pretense
for
litigation,
not
the
way
he
sold
these
materials
to
arvin
drivon.
i'd
just
say
the
imbalance
that
--
the
statute
is
cast
in
terms
of
the
prosecution
evidence,
but
the
prosecution
bears
the
burden.
but
ginzburg
recognizes
the
probative
value
of
the
evidence,
and
if
the
defendant
had
introduced
evidence,
if
he
treated
these
films
seriously,
he
would
have
--
i
concede
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
similar
instruction,
that
the
jury
could
consider
the
way
he
considered
the
film
as
probative
in
social
value.
the
evidence,
the
instructions
are
weighed
in
favor
of
the
prosecution
because
that's
all
the
evidence
there
was.
and
the
fact
that
the
statute's
weighed
in
favor
of
the
prosecution,
it
doesn't
mean
the
only
evidence
that
they
are
being
treated
in
a
pandering
manner
is
admissible
evidence
for
those
instructions.
i
want
to
thank
the
court
for
you
attention,
if
there's
no
other
questions,
i
appreciate
it.
