justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wells,
let
me
just
ask
you
primarily
question.
i
take
that
the
--
your
argument
about
equal
protection
is
not
before
us.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
stein,
just
before
you
leave
the
instruction,
do
you
submit
the
instruction
as
proper
as
given?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
--
and
the
instruction
as
i
read
it
says
that
simply
on
the
basis
of
emphasis,
sole
emphasis
that
you
have
cited
that
word
of
the
sexually
provocative
aspect
to
the
publication.
that
fact,
i
assume
that
means
that
fact
alone
could
justify
the
conclusion
that
the
matter
is
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value.
that
would
mean
even
if
he
was
selling
time
magazine
that
would
justify
that.
could
you
say
that's
a
correct
statement
at
all
or
do
i
misread?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that's
a
correct
statement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
were
stating
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
says
it,
doesn't
it?
it
says
that's
all
i
need.
if
you
conclude
that
the
purveyor's
sole
emphasis
is
in
the
sexually
provocative
aspect
of
the
publication,
in
other
words,
there
is
a
picture
on
page
37
that's
sexually
provocative.
that
fact
can
justify
the
conclusion
that
the
matter
is
utterly
without
redeeming
social
importance.
it
doesn't
have
to
say
that
if
one
sells
time
magazine
by
emphasizing
a
particular
picture
in
a
certain
page,
that
would
be
enough
to
justify
a
jury
conclusion
that
that
issue
of
time
magazine
was
utterly
without
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
--
i
suppose
you
have
three
kinds
of
material,
obscene
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
clearly
not
obscene
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
an
area
in
between
that's
arguably
protected
and
arguably
obscene,
is
that
what
we
have
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
for
purpose
of
our
decision,
do
we
assume
that
it's
in
that
area
since
the
judge
said
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
when
you're
in
an
arguable
area,
let's
say
we
don't
have
time
magazine
but
we
have
playboy
something
that's
much
closer
to
the
line.
then,
if
there's
a
mixture
there,
articles,
pictures
and
so
forth,
wouldn't
that
be
true
that
this
instruction
would
justify
the
finding
of
at
least
the
third
element
of
the
test
about
obscenity,
just
on
the
basis
of
one
picture?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
with
your
opponent
that
there's
a
distinction
between
sexually
provocative
material
and
prurient
material?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
--
that
--
there
are
entirely
separate
elements
and
this
instruction
only
talks
about
the
sexual
provocative,
it
doesn't
talk
about
prurient.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
am
i
also
correct
in
understanding
that
in
california,
this
social
importance
aspect
to
the
three
parts
of
the
test
is
a
question
of
fact
by
the
jury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
each
of
the
three
parts
of
the
test
are
questions
of
fact
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
clarify
again
for
me
the
preliminary
motion,
does
the
judge
rule
that
as
a
matter
of
law
it
is
unprotected
or
does
a
rule
that
it
is
not
protected
as
a
matter
of
law?
it's
quite
a
difference.
is
he
just
saying,
“i
will
not
rule
that
the
case
must
be
dismissed,”
or
is
he
saying
there
is
an
issue
of
fact
for
the
jury
to
decide?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
--
but
when
he
denies
the
motion,
he
does
not
rule
as
a
matter
of
law
that
it
is
unprotected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
(inaudible)
the
jury
and
we
get
this
instruction
and
you
loose
because
you
had
one
picture
in
the
magazine?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that
your
opponent
says
that
--
i
haven't
read
the
noroff
case.
i
suppose
i
should
have
by
now,
but
he
says
that
case
held
that
the
pandering
evidence
would
not
have
been
admissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
if
the
evidence
was
even
admissible,
how
could
the
instruction
have
been
given?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
this
argument
assumes
that
the
pandering
evidence
was
proper
in
a
federal
prosecution
because
of
the
federal
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
memoirs,
the
last
section
of
the
memoirs
case
suggest
the
contrary
isn't
it?
are
you
familiar
with
the
last
section
of
that
opinion
in
which
the
ladies
chatter,
this
lover,
whatever
the
name
of
the
--
that's
not
the
one.
anyway,
the
old
english
work
was
held
to
be
to
have
social
value.
there
is
a
section
that
says
that
we
don't
have
any
evidence
of
pandering
before?
it
wasn't
--
and
that's
the
state
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
rely
on
the
federal
statute
as
the
only
basis
under
ginzburg
and
memoirs
or
pandering
evidence
being
relevant
which
i
understood
you'd
argue.
i
guess
my
question
is
pretty
bad.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i'm
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
suggesting,
i
think
the
last
part
of
the
memoirs'
opinion
is
contrary
to
your
argument
and
if
it
is,
then
i
wonder
if
we
don't
have
a
california
ruling
that
said
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
this
evidence
was
not
being
admissible
and
therefore
isn't
your
point
correct
that
this
instruction
would
have
been
improper?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
therefore,
wouldn't
--
this
is
also
a
state
prosecution,
wouldn't
it
follow
from
that
case?
the
pandering
evidence
in
this
case
would
also
have
been
inadmissible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
but
if
it
isn't
the
case
and
noroff
then
saying
that
pandering
evidence
cannot
make
the
difference
between
material
being
protected
and
being
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
unprotected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
here,
it
did
make
the
difference
because
the
jury
followed
the
instruction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
--
why
in
this
prosecution
was
any
evidence
of
pandering
put
in
or
why
did
you
need
the
pandering
instruction
now?
what
function
did
it
play
in
this
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
--
let
me
just
--
i'm
not
sure
i
didn't
leave
the
subject
before
i
fully
understood
it.
on
this
instruction,
a
one
picture
in
time
magazine
problem,
supposing
that
one
picture
is
clearly,
patently
offensive,
clearly
appeals
to
unhealthy
prurient
interests,
and
then
the
question
is
whether
the
work
--
well,
the
remaining
issue
then
is
the
work
as
a
whole
without
utterly
redeeming
social
value.
and
on
that
issue,
that
instruction
would
let
that
magazine
be
found
obscene.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
issue,
they
can
resolve
that
issue
solely
on
the
basis
of
evidence
it
was
sold
by
reason
of
appeal
to
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
instruction
would
permit
them
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see
your
point,
yes.
