mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
barrett
prettyman
and
i
represent
the
international
terminal
operating
company
which
i
will
call
ito,
the
employer
of
the
injured
employee,
mr.
blundo
in
this
case.
ito
really
wears
two
hats.
it
is
a
stevedoring
company
whose
traditional
job
is
to
load
and
unload
a
vessel,
but
it
is
also
a
terminal
operator.
it
employs
terminal
workers
and
warehouseman
to
do
the
remaining
work
that
needs
to
be
done
on
a
terminal
after
the
ship
is
loaded
or
unloaded.
mr.
blundo
is
a
checker
and
had
been
for
some
five
years
with
ito.
interestingly,
checkers
also
wear
two
hats.
a
checker
can
be
at
the
vessel’s
edge
checking
the
seal
for
example
of
containers
as
they
come
off
the
vessel
and
he
is
part
of
the
longshoring
operation.
he
checks
those
containers
as
they
are
lowered
as
they
first
hit
the
pier.
that
is
the
checker
“directly
involved
in
the
loading
or
unloading
functions”
that
congress
referred
to
in
their
reports
and
those
are
the
checkers
that
they
said
were
going
to
be
covered
and
of
course
we
contend
that
they
were
going
to
be
covered
because
they
are
part
of
the
loading
or
unloading
process.
but
mr.
blundo
at
the
time
of
the
accident
and
most
of
the
other
time
was
wearing
his
other
hat
as
a
checker,
that
is,
he
was
engaged
some
distance
away
from
where
the
loading
and
unloading
had
taken
place.
he
was
removed
both
distance
and
by
function.
he
was
at
a
different
terminal.
a
substantial
period
of
time
had
passed
since
the
container
that
he
was
working
had
been
unloaded
and
this
particular
container
was
being
stripped
in
a
warehouse
used
for
customs
inspection.
his
sole
job
was
to
break
the
seal
and
as
the
contents
were
unloaded
by
strippers,
he
was
to
check
them
against
his
manifest
to
make
sure
that
the
contents
inside
the
container
corresponded
with
the
manifest
that
he
had
and
were
the
right
things.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
is
correct.
we
know
that
it
was
not
unloaded
at
this
terminal,
but
we
do
not
know
where
it
was
unloaded.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
or
from
what
ship
or
by
whom.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
we
do
know
it
came
by
truck.
i
happen
to
know
it
came
14
miles
because
i
measured
it,
but
that
is
not
in
the
record.
the
record
does
not
even
show
how
far
it
came,
but
he
himself
did
not
know
whose
it
was,
from
what
ship
it
came,
from
what
terminal
it
came,
or
even
who
unloaded
it.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
or
how
long
it
had
been
there.
he
said
that
sometimes
the
period
of
time
was
up
to
a
week
and
another
witness
said
that
is
quite
off
and
even
longer
than
that
before
they
got
to
the
particular
function
that
he
was
engaged
in.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
what?
this
was
a
19th
st.
pier
in
brooklyn
where
he
was
engaged.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
taken
to
the
first
point
of
rest.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
is
correct,
no
question.
now,
we
say
that
mr.
blundo
was
not
directly
involved
in
the
loading
or
unloading
functions
which
i
have
just
referred
to
as
congress’
criteria
as
to
whether
he
was
to
be
covered
or
not.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
unloading
process
starts
when
the
container
is
taken
out
of
the
hole
or
off
the
top
of
the
ship,
kind
of,
depends
upon
whether
you
are
break
bulk
or
container
operation
and
taken
down
to
the
ground
and
then
moved
either
to
the
marshalling
area
for
the
container
or
the
transit
shed
for
the
break
bulk
cargo
and
at
that
point,
when
it
reaches
that
point,
you
are
loading
or
unloading.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
absolutely!
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
actually
that
is
where
i
want
to
stay.
i
am
advocating
the
point
of
rest.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
1972
amendment
adapted
point
of
rest,
because
1972
amendment
specifically
says
and
refers
to
the
fact
that
in
terms
of
unloading
taking
it
to
the
storage
area
or
holding
area
and
that
is
point
of
rest,
and
i
will
get
there
in
just
a
minute
to
some
of
the
specific
language
they
used
in
the
reports
in
which
they
clearly
indicated
that
they
wanted
all
the
operations
up
to
that
storage
or
holding
area
covered
because
that
was
the
unloading
operation,
but
they
did
not
want
covered
people
working
beyond
that
in
the
terminal
area.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
let
me
put
it
into
you
this
way.
mr.
kimball
and
i
are
in
slight
disagreement
on
one
point
only
as
i
understand
it
and
that
that
is
i
think
that
the
congressional
history
is
crystal
clear
as
i
read
it.
mr.
kimball
does
not
think
it
is
as
clear
as
i
do.
but
i
do
not
think
that
mr.
kimball
disagrees
with
me
about
point
of
rest.
i
think
he
reads
the
congressional
history
in
the
end,
clear
or
unclear
as
adapting
the
point
of
rest
thesis.
now
first
of
all,
i
think
it
is
very
important
that
the
point
that
i
was
just
trying
to
make
that
congress
really
intended
loading
and
unloading
to
be
maritime
employment
and
that
is
what
they
were
talking
about.
i
think
it
is
very
important
that
that
be
established.
let
us
just
take
one
sentence
from
the
committee
reports
and
the
senate
and
the
house
adapted
that
is
really
virtually
the
same
committee
reports.
in
those
committee
reports,
the
significant
portions
are
at
the
end
of
mr.
kimball’s
brief,
this
blue
backed
brief
here,
starting
in
the
appendix
and
he
first
has
the
words
of
the
statute
and
then
on
page
little
2,
you
will
see
the
present
act
down
at
the
bottom
and
this,
we
have
a
very
significant
statement
here,
really
the
only
statement,
because
there
was
virtually
no
floor
debate
on
that.
we
have
the
only
statement
as
to
what
congress
really
intended
by
maritime
employment.
it
quite
true
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
we
do
not
have
a
definition
within
the
statute
itself
of
maritime
employment,
but
i
do
not
think
anyone
can
read
these
few
pages
without
it
becoming
crystal
clear
what
they
intended
by
maritime
employment,
namely
the
loading
and
unloading
process.
for
example
they
say,
now
just
listen
to
this
sentence,
“the
committee
does
not
intend…”
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
this
would
be
on
little
page
4
at
the
very
bottom.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
sentence
at
the
very
end.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
“the
committee
does
not
intend
to
cover
employees
who
are
not
engaged
in
loading,
unloading,
repairing
or
building
a
vessel
just
because
they
are
injured
in
an
area
adjoining
navigable
waters
used
for
such
activity.”
now,
if
i
may
interpret
that,
what
they
are
saying
is,
you
can
even
meet
the
situs
test,
but
you
are
not
covered
if
you
are
not
engaged
in
that
loading
or
unloading
process,
i
am
emphasizing
loading
or
unloading
because
obviously
the
building
of
the
vessel
is
not
part
of
cases
before
the
court.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
it
could
be
your
honor,
except
i
really
do
not
think
that
that
is…
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor
because
the
sentences
before
this…
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
that
is
exactly
right.
it
says
the
employees,
so
in
order
to
qualify
an
employee
you
have
to
be
the
employee
of
a
covered
employer.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
well,
it
is
saying
the
employee
that
is
people
who
are
normally
covered
by
the
act.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
right,
who
perform
this
work
would
be
covered.
i
am
sorry
it
is
at
the
top
of
page
5
of
course.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
committee
does
not
intend
to
cover
the
employees.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
you
have
a
very
strange
setup
here
your
honor,
in
which
you
do
say
that
an
employer
is
an
employee
if
he
has
employees
who
are
employees
and
at
the
same
time
you
are
saying
that
so
long
as
one
man
is
an
employee
then
you
have
an
employer
under
the
act.
you
do
have
a
rather
strange
dichotomy
there,
but
i
think
if
this
entire
discussion
really
does
not
go
to
employer,
everyone
has
simply
assumed
that
if
you
have
one
or
more
employees
you
are
covered,
you
automatically
have
your
employer,
but
i
think
what
this
sentence
is
talking
about,
that
it
cannot,
they
are
not
really
talking
about
a
cab
driver
with
all
due
respect
because
they
are
talking
about
somebody
who
is
injured
in
this
particular
area
and
i
think
it
is
clear
throughout
this
whole
paragraph
here
that
when
they
are
talking
about
employees,
they
are
talking
about
people
who
are
employed
on
the
pier
to
do
some
type
of
terminal
work.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
extended
to
this
extent
your
honor
and
it
substantially
extended
it.
you
remember
during
the
1972
discussions
before
congress
representative
of
ila
got
up
and
said
“look
we
got
longshoreman
who
cut
in
half.
here
is
a
man
who
is
injured
on
the
ship
and
he
is
a
longshoreman
doing
typical
longshoreman’s
work.
if
the
same
man
happens
to
be
on
the
pier,
he
is
going
down
the
pier
to
do
maybe
even
similar
work.
he
is
not
covered.
we
have
got
a
cut
in
half
situation.”
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
except
that,
if
i
may
for
a
moment?
it
was
really
addressed
to
the
nacirema
situation,
and
the
nacirema
case,
you
know,
set
up
this
strange
situation.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
am
sorry
your
honor,
it
is
the
one
cited
on
our
brief.
it
is
the
69th
case
and
it
is
the
one
that
holds
that
you
cannot
be
covered
by
under
the
27
act,
you
cannot
get
compensation
if
you
have
an
injury
on
the
pier
even
if
it
caused
by
an
appurtenance
of
the
ship.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
even
though
you
could
be
injured,
but
you
would
be
covered
if
you
were
injured
onboard
the
ship,
that
is
the
nacirema
case.
that
was
the
case
that
was
cited
again
and
again
to
the
congress
and
that
is
precisely
the
evil
that
congress
was
attempting
to
get
at
here.
it
was
trying
to
say
that
you
do
have
these
employees
who
are
engaged
in
the
loading
or
unloading
process,
right
up
to
the
point
of
rest
where
the
storage
or
holding
area
and
if
they
happen
to
be
on
the
pier,
they
are
not
covered.
if
they
happen
on
the
ship,
they
are.
there
was
even
a
fourth
circuit
case
in
which
the
man
was
injured
on
the
pier
but
happen
to
fall
in
the
water.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
they
said
because
he
was
lucky
enough
to
fall
in
to
the
water,
he
was
covered,
but
if
he
happened
to
fall
on
the
pier
he
was
not
covered
and
that
was
what
congress
was
concerned
about
and
that
was
what
they
were
addressing
these
amendments
to.
now,
if
i
may
complete
my
answer,
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
reason
that
there
has
been
a
substantial
extension
of
coverage
is
that
a
great
many
of
the
gangs
that
work
these
ships
increasingly
work
on
shore
and
this
in
particularly
true
of
containers
and
congress
specifically
noted
that.
in
these
last
few
pages
here,
they
refer
specifically
to
the
fact
that
containerization
has
resulted
in
more
and
more
men
working
on
the
pier.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
at
the
time…
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
checker
in
this
case
had
nothing
to
do
at
the
time
that
he
was
injured
with
the
unloading
process.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
not
just
before
that.
we
have
no
evidence
to
that
in
record
at
all.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
justice…
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
see
where
the
difficulty
lies
and
i
apologize
for
confusing
you.
when
i
began
talking
about
a
checker
wearing
two
hats,
i
was
talking
about
checkers
in
general.
checkers
in
general
wear
two
hats
in
the
sense
that
they
can
be
doing
one
of
two
types
of
jobs,
one
at
the
ship’s
edge
and
the
other
at
some
distant
terminal.
now,
this
particular
man
was
working
at
the
time
of
injury
at
the
distant
terminal.
we
do
have
evidence
that
is
part
of
a
proffer
that
is
not
actually
proof,
but
part
of
a
proffer,
that
he
did
spend
on
other
occasions
up
to
20%
of
his
time
on
lighters
or
onboard
a
ship,
but
we
have
no
indication
that
how
long
ago
this
was
or
what
the
precise
nature
of
that
work
was
or
anything
else.
this
man
so
far
as
this
record
is
concerned
was
wearing
the
second
hat
that
i
was
talking
about
and
was
far
removed
from
the
unloading
process
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
you
in
that
regard
that
congress
specifically
said
in
the
report
that
i
was
just
referring
to
you
that
checkers
were
covered
only
if
they
were
directly
involved
in
the
loading
or
unloading
process.
now,
that
statement
simply
makes
no
sense.
if
you
adapt
the
view
for
example
of
the
benefit
review
board,
that
it
does
not
make
any
difference
where
a
checker
is
or
what
he
is
doing
or
whether
you
have
a
clerical
worker
or
not.
let
me
just
give
you
an
example
of
the
extent
to
which
the
benefit
review
board
is
going.
despite
these
statements
in
here,
at
least
eight
statements,
eight
statements
in
the
legislative
history
that
i
have
just
referred
you
to
which
severely
qualify
the
extension
of
compensation
and
made
clear
that
congress
was
not
attempting
to
cover
the
entire
terminal
of
the
entire
universe.
despite
that,
the
benefit
review
board
has
said
that
a
temporary
delivery
clerk
who
slipped
on
ice
between
the
parking
lot
and
the
time
clock
checking
it
out
was
covered.
they
have
said
that
a
man
who
trips
over
a
beam
while
returning
to
a
work
shack
with
his
men’s
time
cards
is
covered.
they
have
said
that
a
fellow
who
injures
his
back
while
replacing
paper
in
an
ibm
machine
is
covered.
now,
if
you
take
those
examples
and
i
want
to
emphasize
that
the
government
apparently
backs
the
benefit
review
board.
they
say
a
number
of
times
in
their
brief
that
they
are
truly
backing
them,
if
you
take
those
statements
and
you
compare
them
with
statements
in
the
legislative
history
that
says
that
for
example,
there
is
a
transfer
to
the
storage
or
holding
area
and
if
it
is
not
unloading
or
loading
it
is
not
covered
even
if
the
injury
occurs
in
that
area
or
that
if
an
employee
engaged
only
in
transshipment
which
can
only
mean
in
context
to
taking
from
the
holding
area
or
the
first
point
of
rest
to
another
point
of
the
terminal,
if
he
is
engage
in
transshipment
he
is
not
covered
they
say
that.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
normally
the
only
time
you
have…
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
i
did
not
say
about
normally.
i
said
if
ever.
if
ever
a
ship
is
unloaded
into
a
consignee’s
conveyance.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
would
be
a
bulk
operation.
you
would
not
have
a
longshoreman.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
know,
but
somebody
does
it.
they
would
be
covered.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
now,
in
the
situation
where
analogous
to
that
where
you
have
it
unloaded
directly
to
the
point
of
rest
and
immediately
picked
up
by
the
consummate,
all
the
people
up
to
the
point
of
rest
would
in
fact
be
covered.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
this
virtually
never
happens
your
honor.
you
have
a
gang
which
is
the
unloading
gang.
they
are
assisted
by
certain
other
people
who
are
engaged
in
what
we
call
the
longshoring
operation.
those
people
work
really
as
a
unit.
now,
the
only
time
that
i
can
imagine
that
what
you
are
talking
about
occurs
is
when
let
us
say
for
example
everybody
is
through
work
at
5
o’clock
and
they
are
about
to
go
home
and
all
of
a
sudden
the
stevedoring
company
says
wait
a
minute,
we
have
got
a
crash
job
over
here
in
the
terminal
area,
would
you
be
willing
to
take
it?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
as
a
terminal
operator
he
is
responsible
for
getting
them
to
the
consignee’s
truck.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
is
possible.
the
more
likely
thing
that
what
normally
happens
is
that
if
you
work
as
a
part
of
a
gang,
which
is
normally
about
18
people
plus
drivers,
if
you
work
as
part
a
gang,
you
even
have
on
the
computer
run-out
you
have
a
number
for
gang.
you
check
the
day
before
to
see
whether
your
number
is
up
and
if
your
gang’s
number
is
up
and
if
you
are
not
sick
or
something
then
you
know
that
you
are
to
turn
up
at
a
certain
ship
the
next
day
and
you
work
that
gang
and
you
work
the
gang
the
all
day
and
then
you
check
the
next
day
and
you
normally
are
going
to
work.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
you
can
be,
but
normally
what
has
happened
is
that
these
gangs
have
tended
to
become
units
and
they
tend
to
work
together
and
the
men
change
only
when
there
is
a
death,
retirement,
illness
or
something
of
that
sort.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
normally,
the
ila
covers
everybody
on
the
terminal,
but
you
have
different
locals.
for
example,
the
checkers,
mr.
blundo
was
in
an
entirely
separate
local
and
normally
in
most
piers,
the
locals
are
different.
if
you
are
a
terminal
operator
then
if
you
are
part
of
the
gang
and
i
want
to
emphasize
that
in
terms
that
even
where
you
have
one
company
like
ito
that
does
both
the
stevedoring
work
and
the
maritime
work
on
their
records,
in
their
computer
run-outs,
in
their
pay
scale
and
all
the
rest
of
it
you
are
treated
completely
separately
if
you
are
part
of
the
unloading
process
as
opposed
to
if
you
are
a
part
of
the
terminal
operation,
completely
different
operation
on
the
books
of
that
company
even
though
it
is
the
same
company
hiring
both
sets
of
people.
now,
in
terms
of
the
respondents
indicate
to
us
that
there
are
certain
inequities
that
are
going
to
grow
out
of
our
system
if
you
adapt
point
of
rest.
i
will
just
take
a
couple
of
minute
because
i
want
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal
to
point
out
inequities
arise
if
you
adapt
their
system
rather
than
ours.
for
example,
you
would
have
mr.
caputo
covered
and
the
truck
driver
is
doing
exactly
the
same
work
and
he
is
not
covered.
you
would
have
mr.
blundo
covered,
but
the
off
terminal
checker
who
could
be
checking
precisely
the
same
container
on
another
day
and
this
is
done
off
terminal
would
not
be
covered.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
they
would
also
concede
i
think
and
i
think
they
would
concede,
i
am
not
sure
if
you
are
interested
in
hearing,
but
i
think
they
would
say
that
the
truck
driver
does
not
meet
the
status
test
period,
but
in
addition
to
that
you
have
mr.
blundo
and
caputo
both
covered,
but
you
have
state
workers,
and
this
is
something
they
never
mentioned,
stayed
very
carefully
away
from,
but
in
your
terminal
operations,
in
a
great
numbers
in
these
docks,
you
have
state
workers
doing
your
terminal
operations
and
under
the
statute,
they
are
excluded
which
is
going
to
give
them,
if
you
adapt
their
view
point,
a
tremendous
cost
advantage
of
course,
because
they
do
not
have
to
pay
these
higher
federal
methods
and
they
had
said
nothing
about
the
fact
that
you
are
going
to
have
state
employees
who
are
excluded
doing
exactly
the
same
work
as
the
terminal
operators
who
are
covered
and
entirely
different
system
for
both.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
under
the
old
act
your
honor
i
am
not
sure.
i
just
do
not
know
and
finally
you
have
strippers
and
stuffers
who
work
both
sides
of
the
terminal.
you
have
consolidators
who
are
quite
a
distance
away
from
the
terminal,
stripping
and
the
stuffing
containers
and
yet
only
those
who
happen
to
be
inside
the
terminal
are
going
to
be
covered
if
you
adapt
their
viewpoint.
well,
i
can
go
on
and
on
with
these
examples,
but
the
real
inequities
and
the
kind
of
crazy
situations
develop
not
under
our
theory,
but
they
develop
under
the
theory
if
you
try
to
extend
coverage
as
far
as
the
government
would
have
you
do
it.
i
would
like
to
save
if
possible
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
because
mr.
scafidi
was
injured
in
an
area
that
is
commonly
waterfront
in
brooklyn,
that
entire
area.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
a
few
brief
points
if
it
pleases
the
court.
first
of
all
i
do
not
know
of
a
single
decision
of
the
benefit
review
board
that
has
denied
compensation
to
any
clerical
worker
of
any
kind
who
was
injured
and
i
now
understand
the
government
to
be
fully
supporting
the
position
of
the
benefit
review
board.
you
will
notice
in
their
brief
there
was
some
confusion
there
because
they
were
talking
about
people
who
physically
handled
cargo.
they
apparently
now
have
abandoned
that
requirement.
anyone
who
is
on
the
terminal
working
and
employed
is
going
to
be
covered.
no.
2,
the
government
shows
some
perplexity
about
point
of
rest.
one
of
the
respondents
in
these
cases
is
a
director
of
the
office
of
workers’
compensation
programs
of
the
department
of
labor.
he
is
a
respondent
in
this
case.
that
very
office
issued
a
report
just
last
december.
the
government
has
never
referred
to
that
report
in
its
briefs
although
we
referred
to
it
and
quoted
it
in
our
briefs.
it
is
interesting
that
in
that
report
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
confusion
about
point
of
rest
because
the
department
of
labor
there
says,
the
respondent
in
this
case
their
says,
“the
marine
terminal
operator
is
responsible
for
all
movement
and
handling
of
the
ship’s
cargo
between
the
point
of
rest
and
any
place
on
the
marine
terminal
property
except
the
shipside.”
and
the
respondent
in
this
case
also
says
stevedore
operations
are
confined
to
the
area
between
the
ship
and
the
terminal
area
called
point
of
rest.
so,
i
suggest
to
you
that
when
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked
which
of
the
attorneys
we
should
listen
to
as
to
the
difficulties
of
the
case
and
the
phrases
and
so
forth,
i
suggest
we
should
listen
in
at
least
in
this
regard
to
the
respondent
who
is
certainly
is
an
expert
as
to
what
the
point
of
rest
is,
mr.
easterbrook.
and
i
might
say
incidentally
that
as
to
point
of
rest,
you
do
not
go
back
and
forth
across
the
point
of
rest
as
has
been
described
in
oral
argument
because
we
are
talking
about
a
function
here
and
not
a
geographical
point.
if
a
man
is
engaged
in
the
loading
and
unloading
process,
if
he
is
part
of
the
gang
for
example,
it
makes
know
difference
whether
he
walks
back
and
forth
on
the
other
side
of
the
marshalling
area
or
not,
if
he
is
engaged
in
the
unloading
process
by
way
of
example,
he
is
covered.
now,
as
the
exact
point
of
physical
point
of
rest
may
in
fact
change
from
terminal
to
terminal
or
yard
to
yard
as
the
government
has
suggested,
but
it
does
not
make
any
difference
because
in
each
yard,
at
each
terminal
the
point
is
exactly
fixed
and
believe
me,
there
is
no
confusion
at
each
place
as
to
exactly
where
the
point
of
rest
is
as
he
has
described
himself
using
those
examples.
it
does
not
make
any
difference
that
geographically
it
may
be
different
in
los
angeles
than
it
is
in
new
york,
if
in
fact
it
is
fixed
in
each
place
and
everyone
knows
where
it
is.
let
me
just
finally
say,
that
i
think
the
statement
was
made
that
unloading
and
loading
was
not
specifically
referred
to
in
the
statute.
if
that
was
there,
i
refer
you
to
section
2(4)
where
it
is
referred
to,
section
3(a)
where
it
is
referred
to
and
four
times
during
the
reports
that
i
have
repeatedly
referred
you
to,
they
specifically
talk
about
the
loading
and
unloading
function.
thank
you
very
much.
