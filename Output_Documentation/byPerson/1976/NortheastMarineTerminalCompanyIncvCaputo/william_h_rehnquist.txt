well,
that
is
not
a
necessary
reading
of
2(3),
is
it?
if
you
take
the
phrase,
including
any
longshoreman
or
other
person
engaged
in
longshoring
operations.
it
is
certainly
possible
as
a
matter
of
usage,
to
re-engaged
in
longshoring
operations
as
modifying
the
word
longshoreman
as
well
as
other
person,
does
it
not?
