mr.
angelo
c.
gucciardo
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
two
injured
employees
in
both
these
cases,
carmelo
blundo
and
mr.
caputo.
first
before
starting
my
argument
though
i
wish
to
correct
certain
misconceptions
that
have
already
been
put
forth
to
you.
namely,
it
is
this
that
the
way
of
life
on
the
waterfront
is
that
it
is
a
shake
job.
even
though
you
may
have
a
regular
employer
or
be
a
member
of
a
regular
gang,
you
have
to
report
in
the
new
york
and
new
jersey
area
to
a
hiring
hall
that
is
maintained
by
the
waterfront
commission
and
then
you
are
sent
out
to
work
wherever
work
is
available.
mr.
angelo
c.
gucciardo
your
honor,
may
i
state
this?
i
come
from
a
family
of
longshoreman.
i
have
been
in
this
business
since
1953,
handling
longshore
work
almost
regularly
from
1953
up
until
the
present
time.
i
am
familiar
with
the
waterfront.
so
a
longshoreman
gets
hired
and
he
goes
to
his
hiring
boss.
if
he
is
hired
as
terminal
labor,
his
duties
are
a
number
of
categories
that
is
he
can
load
and
unload
a
lighter,
which
is
a
float.
he
can
load
and
unload
ship
stores
on
a
ship.
load
and
unload
containers
and
load
and
unload
trucks.
he
does
not
know
in
advance
when
he
gets
to
that
pier,
exactly
where
he
is
going
to
be
assigned.
that
is
mr.
caputo
for
you.
when
he
gets
there
in
the
morning,
even
though
he
maybe
a
regular
employee,
he
may
go
onboard
a
lighter
to
unload
a
lighter,
this
is
the
walking
in
and
out
of
federal
jurisdiction
that
congress
intended
to
correct.
not
only
that,
if
he
is
assigned
in
the
morning
to
unload
a
lighter
and
that
work
is
finished
and
the
lighter
is
finished,
his
extra
labor
boss
may
then
say
unload
the
trucks
that
are
delivering
cargo
that
have
to
be
put
onboard
a
vessel.
the
same
way
with
the
checker,
the
checker
does
not
know
in
advance
each
day
where
he
will
be
assigned.
he
reports
to
his
boss,
who
is
incidentally
the
same
extra
labor
boss
and
he
tells
him
where
to
go
and
what
to
do.
ito
is
involved
in
this
case…
mr.
angelo
c.
gucciardo
no
sir,
under
that
theory
he
is
not
in
the
course
of
employment.
he
is
not
working.
if
he
chose
to
go
there
on
his
off
time
and
wanted
to
--
mr.
angelo
c.
gucciardo
that
is
correct.
mr.
angelo
c.
gucciardo
no,
that
is
material
your
honor.
he
is
generally
a
longshoreman,
but
you
also
have
to
be
in
the
course
of
employment
to
have
a
compensable
injury.
you
cannot,
for
example
quit
at
5
o’clock
and
decide
to
come
back
because
a
friend
of
yours
is
working
and
you
want
to
meet
with
him
so
you
can
go
home
together,
you
may
have
the
same
car.
well,
after
you
quit
and
you
are
waiting
for
your
friend
who
may
work
an
hour
overtime,
which
happens
and
get
hurt,
he
is
not
covered.
mr.
angelo
c.
gucciardo
because
he
is
not
in
the
course
of
employment.
mr.
angelo
c.
gucciardo
this
is
general
compensation
law.
in
order
for
an
accident
to
be
compensable
you
must
be
in
the
course
of
employment,
people
working
for
their
employer
and
furtherance
of
their
employer’s
activity.
mr.
angelo
c.
gucciardo
no,
i
am
not
aware
of
any
particular
statute
dealing
with
that
particular
point.
mr.
angelo
c.
gucciardo
yes,
because
when
congress
says
they
are
covered
these
compensation
cases
then
you
refer
to
compensation
law
and
that
is
what
the
mistake
is
made
in
dealing
with
these
cases.
they
are
citing
a
lot
of
cases
involving
unseen
worthiness.
well,
longshoremen
who
are
looking
to
establish
the
liability
on
the
plot
of
the
ship
have
to
establish
that
they
are
in
the
service
of
the
ship
on
the
theory
of
unseen
worthiness.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
compensation
law.
mr.
angelo
c.
gucciardo
that
is
correct.
you
are
not
an
employee
if
they
are-
mr.
angelo
c.
gucciardo
that
is
correct.
you
might
just
as
well
be
a
walker
in
the
street.
mr.
angelo
c.
gucciardo
that
is
correct.
you
are
not
an
employee
and
i
would
say
that
under
that
term
of
section
2(3)
encompasses
that
meaning.
it
means
a
person
engaged
in
maritime
employment.
mr.
angelo
c.
gucciardo
judge
friendly
took
a
more
narrow
view
than
i
take
your
honor.
i
maintain
that
once
you
are
an
employee
within
the
terminology
used
on
the
act,
which
is
clear,
then
the
whole
body
of
compensation
law
is
applicable.
so
that
if
this
person
has
to
go
to
the
bathroom
and
sustains
an
accident
in
the
bathroom
on
the
employers
premises
of
course
or
if
he
is
checking
out
and
has
to
punch
out,
which
is
the
jackson
case
in
the
fifth
circuit,
that
employee
should
be
covered.
i
take
issue
with
the
jackson
case
as
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit,
because
the
man
was
working
all
day
long
within
the
covered
employment.
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
has
to
check
out.
for
that
purpose,
he
is
covered
under
state
law?
i
do
not
see
it.
the
only
reason
that
the
justices
in
that
particular
case
decided
that
way
because
the
employers
and
the
carriers
would
have
us
put
blinders
on
and
say
he
has
got
to
be
doing
something
in
maritime
employment
at
that
time.
that
is
not
so.
mr.
angelo
c.
gucciardo
that
is
not
what
happens
on
the
waterfront.
mr.
angelo
c.
gucciardo
the
purposes
for
which
he
is
then
driving
that
truck
would
have
to
be
examined.
mr.
angelo
c.
gucciardo
yes,
it
could
be
and
i
will
tell
you
where
that
has
come
about.
there
was
a
scafidi
case,
which
was
involved
in
the
della
ventura
case
was
dismissed
for
technicalities.
in
that
particular
case,
an
employer
had
been
moving,
the
piston
stevedoring
company
had
been
moving
its
pier
from
one
location
to
another,
which
was
within
10
blocks.
so
rather
than
hire
a
private
trucking
for
all
of
the
existing
cargo
that
was
remaining
on
pier
10
to
go
to
the
state
pier
or
pier
12,
i
do
not
remember
the
number
of
the
pier,
they
used
their
own
drivers
to
go
across
city
streets
and
within
the
terminal.
in
the
scafidi
case,
of
course
he
was
injured
after
he
got
inside
of
the
terminal
and
was
opening
the
container
for
the
purposes
of
re-stuffing
them
into
another
container,
so
that
the
administrative
law
judge
held
that
to
be
compensable
and
the
benefits
review
board
also
held
it
to
be
compensable,
but
taking
your
example,
if
he
had
been
hurt
between
pier
10
and
pier
12,
i
would
say
under
those
particular
set
of
circumstances
that
he
would
also
be
covered
under
the
act.
mr.
angelo
c.
gucciardo
gowanus
bay,
your
honor.
brooklyn
borders
on
gowanus
bay
and
those
are…
mr.
angelo
c.
gucciardo
yes.
mr.
angelo
c.
gucciardo
yes
we
do
have
it
your
honor
because
blundo
occurred
in
brooklyn
and
so
did
caputo.
mr.
angelo
c.
gucciardo
yes.
mr.
angelo
c.
gucciardo
there
is
a
provision
of
the
law
which
says
under
the
compensation
law,
if
you
abandon
your
employment
and/or
injured
while
abandoning
employment
then
you
are
not
covered.
mr.
angelo
c.
gucciardo
under
those
sets
of
circumstances,
yes
your
honor.
the
boss
says
you
can
have
some
time
off.
mr.
angelo
c.
gucciardo
not
to
my
knowledge.
i
could
give
you
a
similar
example
perhaps,
if
you
are
being
disturbed
by
that
particular
point
where
i
did
have
a
case
involving
a
longshoreman
who
was
told
by
the
boss,
now
you
go
pick
up
the
pay
of
all
the
men
who
worked
on
pier
so
and
so
during
the
week,
because
it
is
a
shake
job,
they
have
to
go
to
the
various
piers
to
pick
up
their
salary.
so
if
the
boss
gives
him
time
off
with
pay,
that
is
very
crucial,
that
with
pay
and
he
goes
to
pick
up
that
pay
of
all
his
employees
for
that
particular
gang
and
brings
it
back,
that
is
also
compensable
under
the
law
because
they
are
traveling
the
waterfront
and
this
is
accepted
procedure
between
terminal
operators
and
the
international
longshoreman’s
association,
that
one
man
goes
to
pick
up
the
pay
for
all
of
the
men.
mr.
angelo
c.
gucciardo
of
course
seamen
are
excluded
on
this
act,
but
i
know
what
you
have
reference
to
that
it
is
possible
to
extend.
mr.
angelo
c.
gucciardo
not
at
all
your
honor,
that
has
to
do
with
seamen
and
it
has
to
do
with
the
jones
act
and
is
entirely
different.
i
wanted
to
make
a
point
that
section
9(20)
which
deals
with
presumptions
should
be
continued
to
be
enforced.
the
average
longshoreman
cannot
afford
the
proceedings
to
prosecute
these
cases.
all
of
the
costs
of
these
proceedings
are
born
by
me
personally
and
my
firm
of
course.
so
that
the
purpose
of
the
law
was
that
the
burden
of
proof
should
be
on
the
employers
and
their
carriers
because
they
were
best
able
to
sustain
the
cost
of
prosecuting
these
claims.
all
a
person
has
to
do,
who
is
injured
on
the
waterfront,
is
to
say,
i
am
a
longshoreman.
i
was
working
on
the
job
and
i
got
hurt
and
my
employer
engages
longshoreman
to
work
on
the
ship
and
on
the
piers.
now,
the
burden
is
on
the
employer
and
carrier
to
come
forth
and
disprove
that
claim.
you
will
notice
in
both
these
cases,
the
caputo
case
they
presented
no
evidence
of
what
so
ever.
in
the
blundo
case
they
attempted
to
present
some
evidence
in
the
form
of
a
safety
man,
whose
knowledge
of
the
facts
seem
to
be
faulty,
but
in
any
event,
there
is
no
proof
to
the
contrary
or
of
any
record
that
this
does
not
fall
within
the
presumption
of
the
act,
also
the
other
phase
of
the
law
which
says
that
if
there
are
serious
questions
of
fact
and
law
then
it
is
to
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
claimant.
well
is
this
not
what
is
occurring
here
now?
there
is
a
serious
question
of
fact
and
law
and
if
that
is
truly
bothering
you
gentlemen
it
has
to
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
claimant
because
that
is
what
the
law
has
been
for
many,
many
years.
another
misconception,
i
am
sorry
to
jump
back
and
forth,
but
my
adversary,
mr.
prettyman
says
that
it
almost
never
happens
that
ships
are
unloaded
directly.
it
happens
quite
often.
it
happens
in
two
instances
that
i
know
of,
banana
ships
and
frozen
cargo.
they
are
perishable
items.
so
that
if
that
has
to
be
unloaded
the
same
longshoreman,
mr.
caputo,
mr.
blundo,
are
used
in
a
direct
line
from
the
ship
directly
into
the
consignee’s
truck.
they
have
to
use
the
longshoreman
to
load
their
trucks
because
they
require
special
heavy
equipment
such
as
high-lows,
dollies
and
manual
labor
to
put
it
into
the
truck.
a
truck
man
cannot
possibly
carry
all
these
equipment
with
him.
it
is
recognized
on
the
waterfront
that
this
is
the
way
it
has
to
be
done.
the
only
reason
that
the
truck
man
participates
is
otherwise
the
employer
is
paying
him
to
do
nothing
and
watch
the
truck
being
loaded.
so
he
tells
him
you
have
to
help.
the
word
transshipment
used
by
the
committee
reports
in
the
house
and
in
the
senate
meant
exactly
that.
an
employer
does
not
transship
within
his
own
terminal.
somebody
else
does
it,
takes
it
outside
of.
you
do
not
move
furniture
in
your
own
house
from
upstairs
to
downstairs.
that
is
not
moving
away
from
your
house
and
moving
the
cargo
away
from
the
terminal,
somebody
else
does
it
and
it
is
that
person
who
picks
it
up
that
was
intended
to
be
excluded.
i
am
sorry
i
went
over
your
honor.
