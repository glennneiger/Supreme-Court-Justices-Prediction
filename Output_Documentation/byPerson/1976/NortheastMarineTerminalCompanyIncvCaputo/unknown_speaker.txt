unknown
speaker
what
would
clerical
personnel
be
doing
on
the
dock?
i
can
understand
a
checker
or
somebody
keeping
track.
would
that
be
within
your
definition
of
a
clerical
employee?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
telephone
operators?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
who
were
employees
of
longshoreman?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
at
site
the
as
on
the
dock?
unknown
speaker
and
one
of
the
work
of
a
secretary
is
hazardous?
unknown
speaker
is
a
secretary’s
work
hazardous?
unknown
speaker
well
then
how
is
it
covered?
unknown
speaker
on
what
basis,
is
what
i
want
to
know?
unknown
speaker
would
not
a
bookkeeper
or
a
telephone
operator
whose
place
of
employment
was
on
the
dock
and
whose
employer
was
followed
in
the
definition
of
2(4)
and
that
would
be
maritime
employment
because
that
is
the
employers’
business,
so
would
not
a
telephone
operator
or
a
bookkeeper
fall
within
the
literal
terms
of
these
two
statutory
provisions?
unknown
speaker
the
necessity
of
intendment
--
just
i
think,
how
about
the
literal
terms?
you
do
not
think
they
are
in
maritime
employment?
unknown
speaker
where
are
you
referring
to?
unknown
speaker
which
is
on
page
3
on
your
brief,
i
think,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
not
think
that
a
telephone
operator
employed
by
stevedore
&
company
whose
business
is
to
load
and
unload
ships,
is
engaged
in
maritime
employment?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
are
talking
now
about
maritime
employment.
unknown
speaker
then
it
says
including
any
longshoreman
but
that
just
stopped
with
the
first
phrase,
would
not
the
clerical
employee
be
covered?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
other
definition
of
maritime
employment
in
the
act?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kimball,
on
the
question
of
situs
2,
do
you
read
the
definition
in
3(a)
as
including
buildings
which
are
on
a
pier
or?
you
have
a
list
of
things,
none
of
which
includes
a
building,
but
they
do
include
building
way
which
kind
of
suggests
to
me
they
did
not
intend
to
include
building.
unknown
speaker
what
is
a
building
way
mean
in
3(3)?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kimball.
unknown
speaker
before
you
leave
your
point
about
navigable
waters
including
a
pier,
i
did
not
understand
the
argument
you
have
based
on
that
last
sentence.
i
did
not
understand
your
point
at
all.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
the
pier
is
within
the
statutory
definition
of
navigable
water
and
the
report
says
the
pier
is
to
be
distinguished
from
navigable
waters,
which
seems
inconsistent?
what
do
you
draw
from
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
would
not
be
the
first
government
agency
that
did
that
sort
of
thing,
would
it
and
it
is
a
lot
of
those
have
been
upheld
by
this
court
as
being
administrative
constructions.
unknown
speaker
was
this
container
unloaded
at
this
pier?
is
this
the
case
were
we
do
not
know
where
even
that
it
was
unloaded
in
this
pier
or
from
what
ship?
unknown
speaker
or
from
what
ship.
unknown
speaker
and
it
might
have
come
by
truck
from
the
pier.
unknown
speaker
or
how
long
it
had
been?
unknown
speaker
where
was
this,
on
north
side
of
pier
or?
unknown
speaker
in
brooklyn.
unknown
speaker
and
when
you
used
the
word
unloaded
you
mean
removed
from
the
ship
to
the
dock?
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
no
question
what
this
container
came
from
a
ship?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
contention
that
everything
that
happened
up
to
where
the
container
was,
was
part
of
the
unloading
process?
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
is
yes?
unknown
speaker
you
would
back
a
little
point
rest
for?
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
not
want
to
stay
there,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
think
the
1972
amendment
had
nothing
to
do
with
this?
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
a
difference
between
you
and
mr.
kimball?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kimball
said
that
the
congressional
history
did
not
do
him
any
good
at
all.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
mr.
prettyman.
unknown
speaker
what
page
of
the
blue
brief?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
right
at
the
top
of
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
those
employees
may
be
employees
of
an
employer,
who
does
not
meet
this
test
try
test
too.
it
might
well
be
a
taxi
driver
from
the
streets
of
brooklyn
who
is
over
there
on
the
pier
to
pick
up
a
fare.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it
may
be
that
to
which
the
committee
was
addressing
itself.
unknown
speaker
because
it
is
not
defined
by
the
word
employees?
unknown
speaker
exactly!
unknown
speaker
i.e.
as
an
employer
as
a
covered
employer,
i
think
that
is
implicit.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
the
definition
is
almost
tautological
in
a
way,
is
it
not
and
the
term
employer
is
defined
in
terms
of
what
employees
you
employ?
unknown
speaker
mr.
prettyman
to
what
--
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
as
covered
employees?
unknown
speaker
to
what
extent
did
the
1972
act
extend
covered?
unknown
speaker
like
the
checker
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
there
are
dozens
of
nacirema
cases.
unknown
speaker
which
nacirema
case,
there
are
literally
dozens
of
them?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
is
not
the
checker
in
this
case,
in
the
language
of
the
people
talking
about
the
act,
a
demand
that
it
was
in
and
out
of
federal
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
the
checker
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
just
before
that
he
did
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
you
said
the
checker,
one
of
his
hats
to
use
your
word,
was
to
check
these
things
as
they
came
off.
unknown
speaker
and
the
other
hat
he
wore
was
what
he
was
doing
here.
unknown
speaker
just
in
and
out
of
federal
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
happens
that
a
ship
is
unloaded
directly
into
a
consignee’s
conveyance,
you
would
say
that
all
the
people
engaged
in
putting
it
in
the
conveyance
are
covered,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
then
you
would
not
have
a
point
of
rest,
would
you?
that
would
be
a
break
bulk
operation.
unknown
speaker
yes,
that
is
all
i
wanted
to
know.
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
there
is
a
point
of
rest
and
the
cargo
is
unloaded
there.
do
the
same
crews;
is
it
possible
that
on
some
piers
or
on
some
terminals
the
same
crews
move
it
from
the
first
point
of
rest
into
consignee’s
conveyance?
unknown
speaker
is
your
client
responsible
for
loading
cargo
into
consignee’s
conveyances?
unknown
speaker
so
assume
that
i
work
for
your
client.
on
one
day
could
i
be
assigned
to
unloading
the
ship,
the
next
day
assigned
to
moving
cargo
to
the
consignee’s?
unknown
speaker
but
you
might
be
part
of
another
gang
the
next
day?
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
not
a
different
union,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
out
of
situs?
unknown
speaker
mr.
blundo
would
be
on
the
account
of
the
employer,
test
with?
unknown
speaker
your
first
example
had
to
do
with
truck
drivers
and
that
would
be
because
presumably
his
employer
would
not
be
a
covered
employer?
unknown
speaker
were
state
employees
excluded
in
the
old
act?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gucciardo,
mr.
prettyman
has
given
us
some
conception
of
his
ideas
of
how
the
waterfront
works.
you
are
now
giving
us
some
of
yours.
i
do
not
know
that
either
of
you
would
qualify
as
an
expert
witness
if
this
was
in
a
trial
court.
if
there
are
disputes
between
the
two
of
you,
whose
word
are
we
to
take
as
to
the
practices?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gucciardo,
could
i
ask
just
one
question
before
you
get
too
deep
into
your
argument?
under
your
theory
of
the
statute,
supposing
mr.
caputo
took
his
wife
to
the
movies
and
after
the
show
they
decided
to
walk
across
the
pier
where
he
normally
works
and
he
fell
and
was
injured,
will
he
be
covered?
unknown
speaker
but
then
do
you
contend
that
his
status
at
the
time
of
the
injury
is
controlling?
unknown
speaker
the
fact
that
he
is
generally
a
longshoreman
is
irrelevant?
unknown
speaker
is
the
reason
he
is
not
covered
because
of
something
in
section
2(4)
or
something
in
section
3(a)?
what
is
the
reason
under
the
statute
if
he
is
not
covered?
unknown
speaker
where
does
the
statute
require
that?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
is
general
compensation,
but
does
this
statute
contain
a
similar
requirement
and
if
so,
in
what
section?
do
you
know
or
if
you
do
not?
unknown
speaker
so
we
have
to
go
outside
the
written
language
of
the
statute
to
find
the
limitation
you
have
just
described?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
not
even
an
employee
if
you
are
off
work,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
engaged
in
maritime
employment
if
you
are
not
working?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
just
plain.
is
it
not
that
in
section
2(3),
the
term
employee?
you
are
not
even
an
employee
if
you
are
not
on
duty,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
and
by
that
you
then
mean
at
the
time
of
the
injury.
there
is
a
dispute
in
the
briefs
that
apparently
has
evaporated
because
i
thought
one
that
judge
friendly
relied
on
part
as
a
status
over
a
period
of
time
as
an
employee.
you
seemed
to
have
abandoned
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
on
your
theory,
if
the
man
starts
out
doing
maritime
employment
on
the
dock
in
the
morning
and
is
asked
to
drive
a
truck
10
miles
away
at
noon
to
take
some
stuff,
comes
back
at
2
o’clock
and
has
an
accident
while
he
is
driving
the
truck
he
is
covered.
unknown
speaker
if
that
did
happen
on
the
waterfront,
would
he
or
would
he
not
be
covered
under
your
theory?
unknown
speaker
but
he
could
be?
unknown
speaker
it
would
not
come
under
3(a),
would
it
not,
the
situs
test?
unknown
speaker
on
the
streets
of
brooklyn,
you
say
that
is
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
we
do
not
have
that
case
here.
unknown
speaker
we
do
not
have
quite
a
appeal
on
argument
at
the
moment.
unknown
speaker
up
here?
unknown
speaker
what
if
during
the
course
of
true
longshoreman
operations,
the
longshoreman
wants
to
go
uptown
or
half
a
mile
off
the
pier
to
get
some
cigarettes.
the
gang
boss
says
it
is
all
right
for
him
to
do
it
and
he
is
injured
as
he
is
going
in
or
out
of
the
tobacco
shop.
he
is
covered
or
not
covered?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
he
abandon
it
when
the
gang
boss
let
him
go?
unknown
speaker
has
not
the
review
board
taken
rather
different
view
of
that
in
some
comparable
cases?
unknown
speaker
as
far
as
the
law
the
longshoreman
is
a
seaman,
did
he
not
suddenly
extend
the
waterfront
to
time
square
in
the
seamen’s
case?
unknown
speaker
none
of
that
washes
off
on
the
longshoreman.
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook,
just
i
so
am
sure
of
your
position,
if
i
read
your
brief
correctly,
is
the
government’s
position
that
the
example
i
gave,
a
man
returning
from
the
movie
and
walking
across
the
pier,
there
would
be
coverage,
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
where
is
the
2(2)…
unknown
speaker
i
am
trying
to
find
it
in
the…
unknown
speaker
902(2)?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
how
about
transshipment?
it
comes
off
the
ship
of
dock
a,
it
is
moved
to
dock
b,
to
dock
c,
to
dock
d
and
the
man
is
looted
on
to
dock
x,
is
he
covered?
unknown
speaker
well
would
that
be,
if
that
would
be
six
months
later?
unknown
speaker
do
you
suggest
mr.
easterbrook
that
this
statute
is
so
clear
that
we
need
not
to
resort
to
legislative
history?
unknown
speaker
that
is
unclear
as
any
statute
could
conceivably
be,
is
it
not
or
perhaps
you
could
conceive
at
one…
unknown
speaker
i
think
it
is
just
as
easy
if
it
said,
we
are
abandoning
the
point
of
rest?
you
know,
in
just
plain
english?
unknown
speaker
congress
could
have
said
we
are
abandoning
the
theory
of
coming
to
rest.
(voice
overlap)
did
they
abandon
it
of
not?
unknown
speaker
it
was
not
considered?
unknown
speaker
it
was
not
even
mentioned?
unknown
speaker
just
mentions
the
fact
that
you
walk
in
and
out
of
federal
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
it
is
the
same
thing.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
difference
mr.
easterbrook
that
under
the
old
view
you
walk
in
and
out
of
coverage
during
the
same
day
regularly
whereas
here
he
is
pretty
much
in
or
out
for
a
whole
day
at
the
time.
unknown
speaker
but
were
they
not
20%
of
the
day?
it
is
not
20%
of
each
day?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
your
view
of
the
record
that
it
supports
the
notion
that
it
is
quite
frequently
true
that
employees
work
on
both
sides
of
the
point
of
rest
during
the
same
day?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
really
was
not
my
question.
do
you
think
the
record
fairly
supports
the
view
that
employees
typically
work
on
both
sides
of
the
point
of
rest
on
the
same
day?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
we
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
material
in
the
brief
that
has
this
kind
of
a
brandeis
brief
on
where
the
point
of
rest
is.
that
seems
to
support
the
contrary
view
as
i
read.
unknown
speaker
judge
friendly,
of
course
pointed
out
his
difficulty
was
that
we
did
not
have
those
facts
before
us.
so
he
in
effect
suggested
he
might
have
viewed
the
case
differently
if
they
had
them
before
him.
my
question
is
do
you
think
they
are
before
us
now?
unknown
speaker
but
assuming
we
accept
the
entirely
the
truth
of
all
that,
what
relevance
does
it
have?
unknown
speaker
and
then
judge
friendly
in
his
opinion
for
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
second
circuit
laid
a
video
store
(ph)
by
the
fact
that
one
or
more
of
these
employees,
at
least
at
other
times
and
on
other
days
had
worked
in
employment
that
would
be
clearly
covered.
do
you
think
--
how
important
is
that
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
but
your
point
is?
but
they
met
the
test
when
they
were
engaged
in
the
occupation
which
they
were
engaged
at
the
time
they
were
injured,
is
it
not
right?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
need
that
addition?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
proper
test?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
your
point
was
that
under
the
statute
these
people
are
covered
when
they
were
engaged
in
what
they
were
engaged
in
at
the
time
they
were
injured.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
mean
that
they
quit
their
job
and
are
now
a
taxi
driver,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
the
test
is
what
they
were
doing
and
where
they
were
at
the
time
they
are
injured,
is
it
not
your
submission?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
think
your
brothers
on
the
other
side
differ
with
you
on
that?
unknown
speaker
those
cases
are
not
here.
unknown
speaker
suppose
blundo
instead
of
loading
the
cheese
was
repairing
the
truck.
unknown
speaker
the
truck
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
how
in
the
world
can
repairing
the
truck
be
longshoreman
duties?
unknown
speaker
was
this
truck
doing
that?
unknown
speaker
that
is
right.
unknown
speaker
and
they
were
repairing
that
truck
is
no
way
you
can
recap.
unknown
speaker
mr.
carmelo
blundo,
he
would
not
be
covered
on
this.
unknown
speaker
in
repairing
the
truck?
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook,
i
would
have
thought
in
kind
of
as
indefinite
statute
as
this
that
one
of
the
arguments
against
the
point
of
rest,
there
would
be
its
administrative
difficulty
that
you
would
have
constant
factual
disputes,
but
i
frankly
gather
from
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question
that
we
would
have
be
engaged
in
very
much
the
same
kind
of
disputes
if
we
followed
your
theory.
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook,
another
of
way
saying
the
same
thing
that
you
do
not
really
read
the
word
employees
in
that
sentence
is
being
used
in
the
statutory
definitional
sense.
unknown
speaker
and
the
employer
may
not
be
a
covered
employer?
unknown
speaker
the
use
of
employees
in
the
committee
report
may
not
be
the
technical
use
of
how
it
is
defined
in
the
statute,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
what
definition
are
you
taking
of
point
of
rest
for
this
comment?
unknown
speaker
but
using
your
statements
it
does,
you
are
saying
it
occurs
a
hundred
feet
such
and
such
what
definition
are
you
taking,
even
though
you
may
disagree
with
me?
unknown
speaker
do
any
of
these
definitions
bind
any
courts
or
any
board?
unknown
speaker
then
what
is
the
relevance?
unknown
speaker
well,
because
it
does
not
mean
anything
to
some
of
these
people
does
not
suggest
that
it
would
not
be
meaningful
to
a
court
to
something
they
assume,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
could
not
a
court
make
its
own
definition?
unknown
speaker
i
making
a
clear
definition,
i
mean
making
it
in
light
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history.
unknown
speaker
the
point
of
rest
whenever
it
hits
the
land?
unknown
speaker
the
point
of
rest
is
whenever
the
cargo
leaves
the
water
and
hits
the
land.
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook,
what
if
the
telephone
operator
working
for
the
stevedore
employer
in
his
office
on
the
pier
when
she
is
injured
in
the
course
of
her
employment?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
not
the
test
be
whether
or
not
it
is
maritime
employment?
unknown
speaker
would
that
not
be
the
ultimate
statutory?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
covered
in
so
far
as
both
certainly
as
situs.
unknown
speaker
how
a
employer
is
a
covered
employer?
unknown
speaker
but
maritime
employment
would
be
the
ultimate
issue?
unknown
speaker
plenty
of
weight
was
given
to
the
legislative
history,
would
you
think
there
could
be
any
result
other
than
upholding
the
telephone
operator
is
not
covered,
much
of
these
words
are
all
meaningless?
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook,
is
there
any
support
for
the
notion
that
the
term
maritime
employment
has
sort
of
a
historical
significance
that
refers
to
the
kind
of
work
that
years
ago
was
done
by
people
who
went
down
to
the
sea
and
ships
etc?
unknown
speaker
but
under
the
act…?
unknown
speaker
i
disagree
with
you
mr.
easterbrook.
it
has
two
categories.
one
is
a
maritime
employment
category
and
the
other
is
the
harbor
worker
category.
the
harbor
worker
category
is
the
one
that
includes
the
ship
repairman
and
the
ship
builder
and
ship
breaker.
unknown
speaker
if
you
say
if
term
employee
means
(1),
any
person
engaged
employment
operation
in
maritime
employment
including
longshoreman
or
other
longshoring
activities
and
(2),
any
harbor
worker
including
ship
repairman
and
so
forth.
is
that
a
permissible
reading
grammatically?
unknown
speaker
the
section
is
also
supported
by
the
fact
that
traditionally
the
harbor
worker
was
not
in
maritime
employment
as
you
point
out
in
your
own
foot
note.
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
part
of
the
legislative
history
any
clearer
than
the
paragraph
about
loading
and
unloading?
unknown
speaker
and
would
apply
to
dock
worker
who
never
put
a
foot
on
the
ship?
unknown
speaker
and
the
uses
of
the
exact
same
dollies
and
winches
and
everything
that
people
on
land
use?
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook
is
the
government’s
position
consistent
with
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit?
unknown
speaker
so
you
support
the
position
of
the
board?
