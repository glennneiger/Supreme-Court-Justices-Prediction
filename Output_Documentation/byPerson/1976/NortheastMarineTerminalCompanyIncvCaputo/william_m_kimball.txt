mr.
william
m.
kimball
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
consolidated
cases
present
first
impression
questions
as
to
the
meaning
and
scope
of
the
status
and
situs
1972
amendments
to
sections
2(3)
and
3(a)
of
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers’
compensation
act.
petitioners
in
76-444
whom
i
represent,
have
always
conceded
that
there
is
no
situs
question
in
their
case
and
so
i
hope
to
be
permitted
to
limit
my
remarks
to
the
status
question.
these
consolidated
cases
present
the
status
question
in
two
distinguishable
fact
situations.
in
76-444,
the
employee
caputo
was
helping
load
a
consignee’s
truck
with
break
bulk
boxes
of
cheese.
in
76-454,
employee
e.
blundo
was
tallying
cargo
which
was
being
removed
from
a
shipping
container.
therefore,
i
hope
to
be
allowed
to
focus
my
remarks
on
whether
employees
doing
this
sort
of
work
which
mr.
caputo
was
doing,
truck
loading
work
have
the
coverage
status.
now,
the
threshold
question
is
whether
i
may
properly
focus
solely
upon
the
work
which
mr.
caputo
was
doing
when
he
was
injured
or
whether
as
did
the
majority
below.
i
must
also
consider
the
fact
that
on
other
occasions,
mr.
caputo
spent
a
significant
part
of
his
time
aboard
ships
doing
the
traditional
loading
and
discharging
work
of
a
longshoreman.
neither
the
administrative
law
judge
nor
the
benefits
review
board
paid
any
attention
whatsoever
nor
even
mentioned
what
mr.
caputo
did
on
other
occasions.
the
administrative
law
judge
specifically
fixed
mr.
caputo’s
status
at
the
time
of
the
injury
and
the
board
affirmed
on
the
ground
that
at
that
time,
he
was
loading
and
discharging
a
ship
and
not
loading
a
truck
as
judge
widener
discerned
in
a
similar
fact
situation
in
the
adkins
case
which
is
initially
cited
on
page
5
of
petitioner’s
blue
covered
brief.
the
legislative
history
is
not
crystal
clear.
the
majority
below
and
the
first
and
third
circuit
courts
of
appeals
have
held
that
status
should
not
be
determined
solely
as
of
the
time
of
injury.
the
fifth
and
ninth
circuit
courts
of
appeals
have
held
to
the
contrary.
this
court
in
decisions
prior
to
the
1972
amendments,
has
held
that
section
3(a)
situs,
section
2(2)
injury
in
the
course
of
employment
and
section
2(3),
section
3(a)(1)
exclusion
of
crew
members
must
all
be
determined
at
the
time
of
injury
and
not
with
reference
to
what
the
employee
generally
did
on
other
occasions.
it’s
suggested
on
our
brief
that
it
would
be
anomalous,
if
section
2(3)
employee
status
were
determined
on
the
basis
of
what
the
man
generally
did,
but
then
he
was
excluded
under
the
same
section
because
of
what
he
was
particularly
doing
on
an
occasion.
it
is
further
suggested
on
our
brief
that
the
general
functional
criteria
will
be
almost
appallingly
difficult
to
administer
and
adjudicate
for
reasons
which
we
have
suggested
at
pages
10
and
11.
now,
the
federal
respondent
has
distorted
our
first
point
by
suggesting
that
longshoremen
who
are
working
on
a
ship
and
who
are
obviously
covered
by
both
the
old
and
the
new
act
would
not
be
covered
while
they
were
using
the
ship’s
toilet
facilities.
they
would
be,
because
of
the
work
they
were
doing
or
had
been
assigned
to
do,
and
they
would
also
be
covered
while
they
were
taking
a
coffee
break
aboard
the
ship
because
of
the
work
which
they
had
been
assigned
to
do.
although
the
federal
respondent
makes
an
important
concession
that
congress’
express
intent
to
extend
coverage
“to
employees
who
would
otherwise
be
covered
by
this
act
for
part
of
their
activity
implies
that
only
persons
who
might
have
been
partly
covered
under
the
old
act
are
covered
under
the
new
act
and
parenthetically
i
would
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
context
of
what
i
had
just
quoted
by
this
act”
pretty
clearly
means
by
the
old
act
which
the
committee
was
looking
to
amend.
as
i
say
although
the
federal
respondent
makes
that
important
concession,
it
argues
that
because
of
what
it
says
is
the
risky
task
of
cargo
handling
on
the
waterfront,
all
“physical”
cargo
handling
activity
within
the
statutory
situs
confers
statutory
status.
we
have
a
stipulation
in
76-444
that
the
work
which
the
employee
was
doing,
namely
loading
cheese
in
a
consignee’s
truck
with
the
assistance
of
a
dolly,
had
the
same
risk
factor
wherever
trucks
are
loaded
or
unloaded
with
dollies.
now,
presumably
the
government’s
suggestion
that
there
should
be
a
limitation
on
physical
activity
was
meant
to
exclude
clerical
employees
on
the
situs
who
as
judge
friendly
wrote,
are
not
covered
even
by
the
most
liberal
construction
of
the
statute.
i
should
add
also
parenthetically
that
in
a
considerable
number
of
un-appealed
benefits
review
board
decisions,
the
board
has
held
that
clerical
personnel
are
covered
by
the
amendments.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
i
am
thinking
more
precisely
if
your
honor
pleases,
these
are
vast
installations.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
and
they
have
offices
on
these
terminals.
no
longer
do
the
executives
go
to
the
city
and
conduct
or
work
long
range.
they
are
down
on
the
terminal
and
of
course
they
have
all
the
usual
clerical
people
down
there.
secretaries…
mr.
william
m.
kimball
telephone
operators,
all
of
people
of
that
sort.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
they
are
employees
of
a
statutory
employer,
if
your
honor
pleases.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
because
that
employer
has
some
of
its
employees
who
definitely
are
working
loading
and
discharging
--
mr.
william
m.
kimball
that
is
true
sir.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
excuse
me
if
your
honor
please?
mr.
william
m.
kimball
i
do
not
conceive
it
to
be
so,
no.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
it
is
not
covered
according
to
the
opinion
below,
but
the
benefits
review
board
has
repeatedly
decided.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
well
the
benefits
review
board,
if
your
honor
pleases,
is
virtually
reading
situs
and
status
requirements
out
of
the
statute.
they
seem
bent
upon
extending
this
coverage
to
an
appalling
extent.
they
would
blanket,
i
believe
the
united
states
with
this
coverage,
if
they
could
do
so.
in
the
thousands
and
thousands
of
cases
which
are
now
must
be
before
the
benefits
review
board,
i
do
not
recall
a
single
one
in
which
an
employer
has
prevailed.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
no
sir.
they
would
not
fall
within
the
literal
terms
of
the
statute
or
within
its
intendment
terms.
because
of
the
necessity
--
mr.
william
m.
kimball
no,
if
your
honor
pleases
because
of
the
definition
of
employee
in
section
2(3).
mr.
william
m.
kimball
i
am
referring
on
page
1
of
an
appendix
in
the
blue
brief.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
that
may
be
there
as
well
sir?
and
the
language
there
is,
employee
means
any
person
engaged
in
maritime
employment
and
so
on
and
on.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
no
sir,
because
i
believe
the
statute
necessitates
that
the
employee
of
the
stevedore
be
engaged
in
loading
and
unloading
ships.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
that
is
right
sir.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
i
do
not
conceive
it
to
be
so.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
that
is
true
sir.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
participate
in
some
way
in
the
movement
of
cargo.
participate
in
some
way
other
than
remotely
by
shuffling
papers
or
doing
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
there
is
no
definition
of
maritime
employment
in
the
act
your
honor,
and
that
of
course
has
been
the
difficulty
all
along.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
you
honor,
i
read
the
situs
requirement
as
including
structures
on
a
pier,
dock
or
adjoining
structure.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
i
am
trying
to
find
it.
i
think
building
way,
if
your
honor
pleases,
is
a
structure
having
to
do
with
the
construction
or
repair
of
ships.
it
goes
along
with
marine
railway.
now,
adapting
a
suggestion
in
the
third
circuit
johns’
case,
the
federal
respondent
argues
that
congress’
inclusion
of
“employees
who
pick
up,
i
say
inclusion
on
this
book
myself
and
badly
so,
and
this
gets
into
why
we
don’t
cover
telephone
operators
perhaps.
congress
specifically
excluded
“employees
who
pick
up
stored
cargo
for
further
transshipment.”
the
government
respondent
argues
that
that
must
necessarily
mean
truck
men
who
received
delivery
of
cargo
for
further
overland
transportation,
but
that
interpretation
makes
the
last
two
sentences
of
the
committee
report,
which
are
quoted
on
page
5
of
the
appendix
to
the
blue
covered
brief.
it
makes
those
last
two
sentences
idiotically
redundant
and
it
ignores
the
fact
that
by
statutory
definition,
those
truck
men
are
not
covered
by
the
act
because
the
trucking
companies
are
not
statutory
employers
as
defined
by
section
2(4)
of
the
statute.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out,
because
we
had
read
these
things
so
many
times
and
the
words
escape
us
unless
we
read
them
over
and
over,
but
it
is
interesting
to
note
the
distinction
which
the
committee
is
making
and
i
think
inarguably
with
a
malice
aforethought
if
you
please,
on
this
fifth
page,
they
talk
up
there
towards
the
top,
does
employees,
thinking
in
terms
of
statutory
employees,
whose
responsibility
is
only
to
pick
up
stored
cargo
and
so
forth.
then
they
talk
down
the
last
two
sentences
about
individuals
and
they
talk
not
about
employers,
but
they
are
talking
about
persons
and
then
they
make
an
interesting
distinction,
at
the
very
last
two
lines
they
talk
about
navigable
waters
which
under
the
expansive
situs
definition,
we
know
includes
shore
installations
of
discharge
that
mr.
justice
was
remarking
about,
but
here
they
draw
a
distinction
between
navigable
waters
and
pier
adjoining
navigable
waters,
which
under
the
amended
definition
is
part
of
navigable
waters.
now
the
federal
respondent
has
made
some
diversionary
suggestions
which
i
respectfully
submit
both
to
the
federal
respondent
and
to
this
honorable
court
are
less
than
helpful.
they
refer,
for
instance
to
defense
based
act
decisions
by
this
court,
the
o’leary
case.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
sir?
mr.
william
m.
kimball
if
your
honor
pleases
--
mr.
william
m.
kimball
i
draw
from
that,
if
your
honor
pleases
that
the
last
two
sentences
of
the
report
are
an
effort
to
indicate
that
truck
men
who
are
employed
by
trucking
companies
are
not
intended
to
be
included.
therefore,
in
an
earlier
part
of
the
report,
when
the
committee
excludes
employees
whose
responsibility
is
only
to
pick
up
stored
cargo
for
further
transshipment,
they
are
not
talking
about
truck
men
or
employees
of
trucking
companies.
they
are
talking
about
somebody
else
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
they
are
talking
about
people
like
caputo
or
indeed
people
who
are
performing
functions
like
mr.
blundo
which
mr.
prettyman
will
talk
about
in
just
a
moment.
these
defense
based
act
citations,
i
suggest
are
not
helpful.
the
court
has
held
that
being
injured
at
a
defense
based
act
situs
is
not
sufficient
to
entitle
an
employee
to
compensation.
the
decisions
which
the
government
has
cited
hold
that
the
injury
must
result
from
a
zone
of
special
danger
risk
at
the
defense
based
situs.
we
know
by
stipulation
that
mr.
caputo
was
not
performing
any
high
risk
longshoring
activity,
for
which
as
the
majority
below
conceded
the
act
is
intended
to
compensate.
the
federal
respondent
pleads
for
deference
to
the
benefit
review
board,
consistent
administrating
of
interpretation,
which
as
i
have,
i
hope
not
offensively,
suggested
to
the
court
and
as
is
recognized
by
the
majority
below,
is
a
bootstrap
operation
by
the
board
wherein
they
started
off
the
first
day,
expanding
this
act,
i
think
beyond
meaning
and
as
illustrated
in
the
reply
brief
in
76-454,
the
board
has
given
virtually
no
heed
to
any
status
or
situs
limitations.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
i
think
the
difficulty
if
your
honor
pleases
is
that
the
benefits
review
board
does
not
appreciate
that
in
ever
expanding
the
statute
it
maybe
depriving
employees
of
other
rights
and
remedies
which
are
superior
to
those
provided
by
the
act.
i
suggest
for
instance
that
if
you
expand
the
statute
to
the
ultimate
limits
then
no
one
is
ever
going
to
be
able
to
sue
under
the
authority
of
this
court’s
decision
in
gutierrez,
no
one
is
going
to
be
able
to
sue
a
ship
owner
for
damages
because
of
an
un-seaworthy
cargo
container
nor
is
a
railroad
employee
is
going
to
be
able
to
sue.
thank
you,
your
honors.
