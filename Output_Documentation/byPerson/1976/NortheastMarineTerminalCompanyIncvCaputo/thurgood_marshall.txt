justice
thurgood
marshall
these
consolidated
cases
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
required
that
we
determine
the
extent
of
coverage
provided
by
the
federal
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
prior
to
1972,
the
act
covered
only
injuries
that
occurred
on
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers
who
were
injured
on
the
land
were
ineligible
for
federal
compensation
and
had
to
rely
exclusively
on
state
compensation
remedies.
using
the
water's
edge
as
a
line
of
demarcation,
however,
prove
to
be
unsatisfactory
for
these
amphibious
occupations
whose
work
is
performed
on
both
the
ship
and
the
shore.
accordingly
in
1972,
congress
changed
the
scope
of
the
coverage.
it
retained
the
so-called
"situs
test"
which
looks
to
the
location
of
the
injured,
but
it
enlarged
the
coverage
areas
to
include
in
addition
to
the
water,
piers,
wharf
and
terminals.
it
also
added
a
so-called
"status
test"
which
require
that
the
injured
employee
be
engaged
in
maritime
employment
including
as
relevant
to
these
cases
longshoreman
and
other
persons
engaged
in
longshoring
operations.
at
issue
in
these
cases
is
whether
respondents,
caputo
and
blundo
injured
while
working
on
the
new
york
waterfront
met
these
requirements
of
the
amended
act.
for
the
reasons
stated
and
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
find
that
they
did
and
affirmed
the
judgment.
