mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
the
position
of
the
department
of
labor
that
the
amended
longshoremen’s
and
harbor
workers’
compensation
act
applies
to
all
injuries
suffered
by
waterfront
workers
during
the
process
of
transferring
cargo
between
land
and
water
transportation.
it
is
a
simple
rule,
easily
applied
and
we
believe
that
it
correctly
divines
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
the
government’s
position
that
there
would
not
be
coverage
and
the
reason
for
that
does
not
have
to
do
with
his
status
as
an
employee.
it
has
to
with
the
test
established
in
section
2(2)
of
the
statue
which
is
not
reprinted
in
any
of
the
briefs.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
section
2(2)…
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
section
902(2).
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
right.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
section
requires
that
the
injury
have
a
reason
out
of
the
course
of
employment.
that
would
not
be
matching
the
case
of
the
injury
in
your
hypothetical,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
assuming
that
he
is
moving
away
from
the
waterfront,
your
honor,
in
that
event,
coverage
is
excluded
by
the
situs
rule
of
the
statute
section
3(a)
or
section
903(a).
he
too,
is
not
covered.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
your
honor.
in
our
view,
he
is
covered
and
indeed
that
is
very
similar
to
the
blundo
case
we
have
here.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
in
our
view,
time
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
i
would
like
to
develop
for
a
moment,
if
i
might,
what
we
believe
is
the
correct
test
of
coverage.
the
statute
establishes
on
its
face
a
test
that
as
judge
friendly
pointed
out,
can
be
satisfied
in
three
ways.
a
worker
is
covered
if
he
is
a
longshoreman
or
if
he
is
engaged
in
longshoring
operations
or
if
he
otherwise
meets
the
test
of
maritime
employment.
it
is
clear
that
unless
congress
was
wasting
words,
some
persons
are
covered,
even
though
they
are
not
injured
at
a
moment
when
they
are
engaging
in
longshoring
operations.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
conceivable
that
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
although
we
do
not
believe
that
that
is
the
best
reading
of
the
statute.
but
it
seems
tolerably
clear
that
the
focus
of
the
statute
was
upon
the
occupation
of
the
worker.
the
description
of
longshoreman
and
the
other
description
in
section
2(3)
of
the
statute
is
a
description
of
the
occupations
in
which
persons
engage
on
the
waterfront.
longshoreman,
harbor
worker,
ship
repair
man,
it
is
a
focus
on
occupations
rather
than
a
focus
on
particular
tasks
at
the
moment
of
the
injury
and
that
focus
on
occupation,
rather
than
on
tasks
at
the
moment
of
injury
is
sufficient
to
doom
petitioner’s
theories
and
arguments.
the
occupation
of
longshoreman
traditionally
has
been
understood
to
include
a
wide
variety
of
waterfront
tasks.
in
victory
carriers
against
law,
for
example,
this
court
used
longshoreman
in
that
generic
sense
to
include
the
persons
who
carry
out
most
tasks
on
the
waterfront.
and
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
congress,
which
enacted
this
statute
only
a
few
months
later
and
in
some
measure
in
response
to
this
court’s
decision
in
victory
carriers
and
nacirema
operating
company
was
using
longshoreman
in
some
more
narrow
sense.
all
of
this
too,
must
be
considered
against
the
fact
that
a
maritime
carrier
employs
stevedore
contractors
and
marine
terminal
operators
like
petitioners
to
carry
out
its
duty
to
make
cargo
available
to
consignees.
the
task
is
maritime.
it
is
the
marine
carrier
who
engages
petitioners
to
carry
out
tasks
on
its
behalf
and
it
pays
for
their
services.
the
ultimate
responsibility
is
that
of
the
marine
carrier.
petitioners
act
on
their
behalf.
we
have
discussed
this
duty
at
pages
27
to
28
of
our
brief
and
this
has
caused
some
difference
of
view
i
think,
between
the
two
petitioners.
petitioner
north
east
concedes
at
pages
18
and
19
of
its
brief
that
this
duty
exists
and
that
the
coverage
of
the
act,
therefore,
continues
until
the
marine
terminal
or
the
stevedore
contractor
has
carried
out
that
duty
of
making
cargo
available.
since
blundo
was
injured
before
cargo
was
made
available,
under
the
test
advocated
by
petitioner
north
east,
blundo
would
be
covered
by
the
act.
petitioner’s
contrary
argument
takes
us
a
long
way
from
the
statute.
petitioners
practically
ignore
the
statute’s
plain
words.
the
counsels
for
petitioners
were
not
talking
about
longshoreman
and
longshoring
operations
during
their
oral
argument.
they
were
talking
instead
about
loading
and
unloading,
words
that
do
not
appear
in
the
statute.
the
words
loading
and
unloading
have
come
from
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
and
petitioners
suggest
that
this,
rather
than
longshoreman
and
longshoring
operations,
is
the
proper
test
of
coverage.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no
your
honor,
it
is
not
and
we
think
resort
to
the
legislative
history
is
perfectly
appropriate.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
leads
to
something
to
be
desired.
i
think
that
the
most
important
part
that
we
draw
from
the
face
of
the
statute
is
its
focus
on
occupations
rather
than
tasks
and
i
think
that
is
very
important
for
the
argument
because
petitioners
have
tried
in
order
to
manufacture
a
moment
of
injury
test
to
shift
the
focus
to
tasks
rather
than
occupations.
in
any
event,
petitioners
–
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
i
did
not
grasp
the
question?
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
your
honor
congress
never
adapted
it,
and
therefore,
it
was
not
there
as
to
abandon.
it
had
never
been
a
test
under
the
pre
amendment
act.
the
test
before…
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
in
our
view,
it
was
not
even
considered
by
congress.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
not
even
mentioned
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
very
strongly
mentioned.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
your
honor,
i
believe
that
it
is
terribly
important
that
congress
focused
on
walking
in
and
out
of
the
coverage
of
the
statute.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
in
large
measure
where
they
walk
in
and
out
of
that
coverage.
it
used
to
be,
before
the
1972
amendments
that
they
walked
in
and
out
of
that
coverage
at
the
water’s
edge,
right
smack
at
the
edge
of
the
water
and
that
is
what
this
court
held
in
nacirema
operating
co.
and
victory
carriers
against
law
that
is
where
the
dividing
line
was.
what
petitioners
propose
to
do
is
to
move
that
dividing
line
inland
to
the
point
of
rest
and
then
any
longshoreman
who
walks
back
and
forth
from
one
side
to
the
point
of
rest,
walks
in
and
out
of
federal
coverage
just
like
before.
only
he
walks
in
and
out
of
federal
coverage
at
a
different
place.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
your
honor,
we
believed
that
that
argument
is
inconsistent
with
the
record.
petitioner
mr.
caputo
testified
that
during
times
when
he
was
assigned
to
the
terminal
labor
category
as
he
was
assigned
to
the
terminal
labor
category
on
the
day
he
was
injured,
he
spent
approximately
20%
of
his
time
on
the
water.
he
further
testified
in
the
record
of
this
case.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
was
not
broken
down
in
the
record.
he
testified
further
that
if
he
had
succeeded
in
loading
the
truck
which
he
was
doing
when
he
was
injured,
his
very
next
assignment
could
have
been
on
the
water
and
that
within
days,
he
worked
on
the
water
sometimes
and
other
assignments
at
other
times.
mr.
blundo
testified
similarly.
that
testimony
came
in
as
part
of
an
offer
of
proof.
the
reason
it
was
an
offer
of
proof
rather
than
ordinary
evidence
in
this
case
was
that
counsel
for
petitioner
ito
objected
on
the
ground
that
testimony
was
irrelevant.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
both
longshoremen
in
this
case
testified
that
they
themselves
worked
on
both
sides
of
the
point
of
rest.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
there
is
no
testimony
in
the
record
concerning
that
from
anyone
other
than
the
two
respondents
and
they
testified
that
that
was
true.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
your
honor,
it
is
a
very
funny
brief.
i
see
no
reason
why
you
cannot
take
it
for
whatever
it
is
worth
with
the
understanding
that
it
was
written
by
an
adversary.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
you
can
consider
them
in
a
way
that
you
ordinarily
consider
data
that
as
it
comes
in
the
brandeis
brief
with
the
understanding
that
it
is
inserted
there
by
an
advocate.
but
i
think
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
in
our
view
very
little.
our
point
is
that
it
makes
not
very
much
difference
whether
a
lot
of
people
walk
back
and
forth
from
one
side
to
the
point
rest
to
another.
our
point
is
that,
it
should
not
be
that
that
kind
of
dividing
line
of
coverage
exists
at
all,
no
matter
how
many
people
are
walking
back
and
forth?
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
at
the
minimum,
it
is
just
positive
in
these
cases
because
it
indicates
that
these
respondents
meet
the
test
of
longshoreman.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
two
fold.
i
agree
entirely
with
what
you
said
and
in
addition
they
need
to
test
because
they
meet
the
description
of
judge
friendly.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
do
not
need
it.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
a
proper
test.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
precisely
and
perhaps,
i
am
not
being
sufficiently
clear.
it
is
a
proper
test
for
inclusion
and
not
for
exclusion.
if
they
meet
the
description
of
judge
friendly
of
having
been
on
ships
before,
then
they
are
surely
included,
but
you
do
not
need
to.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no,
then
they
will
no
longer
be
engaged
to
maritime
operations.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no,
it
is
not
your
honor.
we
believe
that
what
they
are
doing
at
the
moment
of
injury
is
not
necessarily
as
positive
if
they
meet
the
status
of
being
a
longshoreman.
so
the
fact
that
they
were
at
the
moment
of
injury
taking
time
off
that
they
were
on
a
rest
break
that
they
were
on
a
rest
break
that
they
were
otherwise
not
doing
maritime
task.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
well,
i
understand
that,
but
there
are
some
cases
that
differ
with
us,
the
jacksonville
shipyards
case.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
right,
but
there
has
been
that
view.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
this
was
the
truck
that
came
from
off
the
waterfront.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
we
would
have
to
know
in
that
event
more
about
blundo’s
ordinary
duties,
more
about
the
nature
of
the
truck
and
more
about
how
the
truck
got
there.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
it
could
your
honor
be
maritime
employment,
if
the
truck
was
a
truck
that
shuttled
goods
from
one
part
of
the
waterfront
to
another
and
they
are
preparing
the
truck
where
he
is
facilitating
that.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
this
truck
was
not
as
far
as
we
know.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
if
this
was
a
truck
that
simply
was
making
a
stop
at
the
waterfront
coming
from
elsewhere
and
going
back
to
elsewhere.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
assuming
that
he
came
with
the
truck.
if
he
was
an
ordinary
longshoreman
and
he
is
(voice
overlap).
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
with
the
ordinary
duties
that
he
had
done
he
would
be
covered,
yes.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
your
honor
he
would.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
do
not
believe
so
your
honor.
i
think
we
could
ask
a
very
simple
question
that
the
board
asks.
the
board
asks
two
kinds
of
questions.
one
is,
did
this
injury
occur
on
the
waterfront
that
replaces
satisfying
situs
test?
that
is
ordinarily
determined
relatively
clearly.
the
second
kind
of
question
the
board
asks
is
whether
this
person
is
a
person
who
devotes
his
life
to
waterfront
activities
sufficient
to
make
him
a
longshoreman.
at
that
point,
we
do
not
care
whether
he
was
at
the
moment
of
his
injury
doing
things
that
are
traditionally
thought
of
his
longshoreman
work.
the
board’s
test
is
a
mean
of
excluding
a
very
broad
category
of
inquiries
that
petitioners
would
have
you
want
to
take.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
chief
justice
i
believe.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
do
not
believe
so.
i
believe
the
key
to
understanding
that
sentence
is
to
clause
beginning,
just
because.
it
is
not
enough
that
they
simply
be
injured
in
a
maritime
situs.
they
have
to
have
something
more.
they
have
to
be
engaged
in
the
career
of
being
a
longshoreman
or
in
longshoring
activities.
just
because
they
are
in
a
situs
they
do
not
qualify,
but
if
they
are
a
longshoreman
that
is
a
different
reason
for
qualifying
under
the
act
other
than
loading
and
unloading.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
something
else
about
that.
it
is
something
that
drew
some
comment
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
earlier
that
part
of
this
was
tautological.
the
sentence
in
the
committee
report
says
that
the
committee
does
not
intend
to
cover
employees
who
are
not
engage
in
loading
and
unloading.
under
section
2(3)
of
the
statute,
no
one
is
an
employee
unless
he
is
engaged
in
maritime
employment
the
longshoreman
operations
and
so
on.
if
you
read
the
word
employee
in
the
legislative
history
together
with
its
use
in
the
statute,
the
committee
must
be
talking
about
people
who
are
already
employees
having
qualified
because
they
are
a
longshoreman
perhaps.
that
one
should
do
that
that
entire
sentence
becomes
less
than
perfectly
accurate
because
then
the
committee
is
saying
we
do
not
intend
to
cover
employees
who
are
in
the
section
2(3)
covered
and
that
clearly
is
not
right.
perhaps,
it
indicates
that
the
sentence
was
written
with
the
less
than
precise
attention
to
detail.
but
in
any
event,
the
explanation
i
just
gave
to
you
mr.
chief
justice
is
we
believe
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
statute,
the
just
because
clause
is
referring
to
what
the
situs
requirement
is
all
about
and
not
to
status
requirement.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no,
we
do
not.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
well,
in
part,
that
is
part
that
is
tautological
too
because
an
employer
is
a
covered
employer
if
he
has
any
employees.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
it
probably
is
not
the
technical
use
as
defined
in
the
statute
and
that
is
the
problem
that
infects
this
committee
report
considerably.
there
is
a
slide
back
and
forth
in
many
places
in
the
committee
report
between
technical
language
as
defined
in
the
statute
and
lay
language
and
it
makes
it
very
difficult
to
read
the
committee
report
side-by-side
with
the
statute
in
a
good
sense.
the
point
of
rest
test
is
in
many
ways
highly
artificial.
in
order
to
demonstrate
this
i
have
taken
some
examples
from
a
book
compiled
by
the
national
association
stevedores,
one
has
been
submitted
to
this
court.
in
philadelphia,
the
point
of
rest
is
the
very
first
resting
place
after
cargo
has
left
the
ships
tackle.
in
other
words,
words
drop
by
the
ship’s
tackle
is
the
point
of
rest,
except
for
container
vessels
of
tucker
avenue
where
the
point
of
rest
is
in
a
marshalling
yard.
in
boston,
the
point
of
rest
in
sheds
near
next
to
the
pier.
the
cargo
is
picked
up
and
dropped
in
several
cases
before
it
gets
to
the
point
of
rest
where
it
stops
waiting
for
someone
to
pick
it
up.
in
willington,
north
carolina,
the
point
of
rest
is
seaward
of
the
real
resting
point.
it
is
other
words,
that
one
of
the
intermediate
stops
and
those
are
different
intermediate
points
used
for
break
bulk
cargo
and
container
cargo.
in
hampton
roads,
virginia,
the
point
of
rest
is
a
100
feet
forward
of
the
bow
and
a
100
feet
aft
of
the
stern.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
my
point
was
there
is
no
definition
of
point
of
rest
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
am
using
the
statement
of
the
national
association
of
stevedores
at
to
what
it
means.
what
definition
may
be
used
to
come
up
with
these
lines
is
quite
beyond
me.
i
do
not
know.
my
point
is
that
the
same
words
mean
different
things
in
different
ports
and
my
suggestion
is
that
perhaps
it
does
not
mean
anything
at
all.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
what
i
was
suggesting
is
that
petitioners
have
asked
you
to
adapt
a
point
of
rest
test
and
i
am
suggesting
that
it
does
not
mean
anything.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
if
you
adapted
a
point
of
rest
test
you
would
use
those
words
to
mean
something
else.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
it
could,
but
at
that
point
the
question
becomes
why?
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
one
of
the
problems
with
the
legislative
history
in
this
regard
is
that
the
words
point
of
rest
never
appears
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
also
a
conceivable
definition.
it
is
once
that
is
used
apparently
in
philadelphia.
but
the
problem
with
that
and
one
that
is
overriding
the
legislative
history
is
that
that
would
create
the
same
sort
of
walking
in
and
out
of
coverage
that
was
discussed
in
nacirema
and
victory
operators
and
lead
to
the
statute.
i
think
it
is
clear
indeed
that
if
petitioners
are
right
in
this
case,
both
caputo
and
blundo
were
the
victims
of
shipping
coverage.
both
men
worked
on
ships.
caputo
spent
most
of
his
time
in
the
holds
of
ships
and
even
when
as
in
the
day
of
this
accident,
he
was
assigned
to
terminal
labor.
he
testified
that
he
spent
approximately
20%
of
his
time
on
ships.
blundo
did
likewise.
both
men
could
have
been
assigned
to
tasks
on
the
water
immediately
after
completing
the
tasks
at
which
they
were
injured.
both
men,
therefore,
spent
part
of
their
time
doing
tasks
covered
even
under
petitioner’s
interpretation
of
the
statute.
both
congressional
committees
wrote
in
a
portion
of
the
legislative
history
appearing
at
page
iv
of
the
appendix
in
the
blue
brief
that
the
statute
would
“permit
a
uniform
compensation
system
to
apply
to
employees
who
would
otherwise
be
covered
by
this
act
for
part
of
their
activity.”
that
indeed
explains
why
the
act
is
written
in
terms
of
covered
occupation.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
assuming
that
the
telephone
operator
does
nothing,
but
operate
telephones,
it
is
quite
likely
that
that
is
a
truly
clerical
activity.
it
does
not
fall
within
the
ordinary
understanding
or
longshoreman
and
longshoring
operations.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
the
ultimate
test.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
the
ultimate
statutory.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
it
is
a
case
your
honor
on
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
a
case
your
honor
on
which
i
would
not
want
to
do
anything
to
pre-empt
an
ultimate
determination
by
the
benefits
review
board
and
it
is
not
a
case
before
us.
but
there
are
some
problems
meeting
the
longshoreman
or
longshoring
operations.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
maritime
employment
is
the
ultimate
issue
and
i
think
that
is
something
the
board
will
have
to
determine.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
it
is
very
difficult
to
find
out
in
coverage
for
the
telephone
operator
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
your
honor,
the
term
maritime
employment
has
a
long
history
in
the
law
of
admiralty.
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
statutory
term
maritime
employment
does
not
mean
in
the
admiralty
word
maritime
employment
and
the
clearest
example
of
that
is
the
coverage
of
ship
builders.
in
the
law
of
admiralty,
ship
builders
were
not
engaged
in
maritime
employment.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
maritime
employment
including
ship
builders.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
your
honor,
i
suppose
that
interpretation
of
the
statute
in
that
respect
depends
on
where
you
put
the
parenthesis.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
would
be.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
would
be
with
one
exception.
the
section
by
section
description
of
that
section
in
both
the
senate
and
house
committee
reports
makes
it
clear
that
there
is
only
a
single
test
maritime
employment
and
that
everything
else
in
that
section
is
used
as
a
subset
of
that
single
test.
that
is
in
the
section
by
section
description.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is,
i
think.
it
is
at
page
16
for
senate
committee
report.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
think
the
act
applies
to
a
dock
worker
who
has
never
put
a
foot
to
the
ship,
we
think
is
unnecessary.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes
your
honor.
ultimately
the
test
comes
down
to
what
the
statute
is
has
aimed
at.
we
think
the
statute
is
aimed
at
the
interface
between
land
and
water
transportation.
the
occupations
involved
in
moving
cargo
between
one
mode
of
transportation
and
another.
the
whole
stevedoring
and
marine
terminal
industry
exists
to
provide
that
interface.
petitioners
were
injured
while
performing
ordinary
and
necessary
tasks
during
the
movement
of
cargo
between
land
and
water
transportation
while
the
cargo
was
still
on
the
waterfront.
they
were
the
central
beneficiaries
of
the
statute
and
the
awards
in
their
favor
should
be
upheld.
perhaps
there
is
uncertainty
in
this.
to
the
extent
there
is,
we
believe
that
they
are
entitled
to
the
assistance
of
three
time
tested
principles.
one,
the
presumption
of
coverage
in
section
20(a)
of
the
statute,
two
the
rule
of
liberal
construction
for
a
medial
statutes
and
the
presumption
of
coverage
in
the
statutes
indicates
that
this
is
one
of
those
statutes
and
three,
the
difference
due
to
the
agency
charged
with
the
administration
of
the
statute.
these
principles
mean
at
the
minimum
that
uncertainties
in
the
scope
of
coverage
of
the
statute
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
coverage.
petitioner’s
arguments
raised
no
more
than
uncertainty.
they
harp
upon
ambiguities
and
they
offer
plausible
tests
to
resolve
those
ambiguities.
but
the
board
too
has
offered
plausible
tests
to
resolve
any
ambiguities.
its
test
is
more
in
harmony
with
the
statute
and
its
legislative
history
and
we
believe
that
the
awards
in
this
case
were
proper.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no,
it
is
not
your
honor.
the
test
coverage
that
the
benefits
review
board
has
constructed
is
somewhat
more
expansive
than
the
test
articulated
by
judge
friendly.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
we
do
your
honor.
