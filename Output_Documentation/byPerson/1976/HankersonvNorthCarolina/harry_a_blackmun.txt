well,
you
are
arguing
in
support
of
the
affirmance
of
this
conviction,
are
you
not?

you
are
attacking
the
holding
of
your
court.
you
are
not
trying
to
support
the
judgment,
you
are
attacking
it.

general
hensey,
what
really
is
the
difference
between
as
a
matter
of
legal
principle
between
the
heat
of
passion
argument
and
the
self
defense
argument?
what
is
the
argument
you
are
making
for
us
to
draw
distinction
if
we
do
reach
it?
