justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
north
carolina
supreme
court,
the
majority
was
holding
what
it
understood
the
federal
constitution
to
require
on
the
mullaney
case.
it
was
not
construing
state
law,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
construing
what
a
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
in
the
light
of
the
mullaney
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
not
deciding
a
north
carolina
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
since
it
affirmed
the
conviction
in
this
case,
you
are
entitled
to
make
any
arguments
you
want
in
upholding
the
decision
to
affirm
this
conviction,
are
you
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
are
flattering
me
and
elevating
me.
