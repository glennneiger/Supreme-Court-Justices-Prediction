mr.
charles
m.
hensey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
north
carolina,
of
course,
is
quite
concerned
over
the
reach
and
the
scope
of
your
decision
in
the
mullaney
case.
the
state
of
north
carolina
feels
that
its
supreme
court
was
essentially
correct
in
its
ruling
on
the
retroactivity
portion
of
the
mullaney
opinion.
the
state
feels
that
the
mullaney
opinion
should
not
be
applied
retroactively
by
this
court.
now,
the
state
recognizes,
of
course,
the
rule
that
when
the
primary
purpose
of
the
new
constitutional
doctrine
is
to
substantially
improve
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process
that
more
often
than
not
you
have
held
that
type
of
decision
to
be
retroactive.
however,
the
state
of
north
carolina
would
argue
in
this
case
that
your
mullaney
decision
because
it
was
as
we
say
on
the
fringes
more
or
less
of
the
question
of
how
much
proof
is
required
in
a
criminal
case
and
who
has
the
burden
of
persuasion
and
what
not,
that
this
decision
and
the
changes
that
it
made
in
the
rules
relating
to
burden
of
proof
on
affirmative
defenses
has
not
brought
such
a
dramatic
improvement
in
the
fact
finding
process
so
as
to
require
the
automatic
retroactivity
of
this
decision.
the
state
of
course
has
cited
the
court
to
certain
psychological
studies
in
its
brief
concerning
jury
perceptions
in
criminal
cases
and
where
in
many
instances,
the
juries
have
been
quite
reluctant
to
convict
and
have
a
much
higher
standard
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
have
a
much
higher
standard
in
where
self
defense
is
right,
and
of
course
as
this
court
pointed
out
not
too
long
ago
in
the
death
penalty
cases,
that
jury
nullification
of
death
penalty
or
cases
involving
the
death
penalty
in
many
instances
has
brought
about
the
change
that
society
recognizes
now
in
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
the
point,
i
am
trying
to
make
of
course
is
that
juries
are
very
knowledgeable
and
very
sensitive
and
are
quite
perceptive
and
the
state
feels
that
the
changing
of
the
rules,
the
burden
of
persuasion
by
the
mullaney
case
has
not
significantly
improved
the
fact
finding
process.
therefore,
the
state
feels
that
this
court
can
quite
legitimately
and
properly
consider
the
other
two
factors
of
justified
reliance
on
the
part
of
the
state
and
the
impact
that
retroactivity
would
have
on
both
state
of
north
carolina
and
on
other
states
similarly
situated.
of
course,
the
state
of
north
carolina
feels
that
a
retroactive
application
of
mullaney
would
have
an
almost
disastrous
impact
on
north
carolina.
there
are
something
over
a
thousand
people
currently
in
the
north
carolina
prisons
involving
murder
type
prosecutions,
while
perhaps
not
all
of
them
would
ultimately
prevail
nevertheless,
surely
petitions
would
have
to
be
heard
either
of
a
post
conviction
type
or
a
federal
habeas
corpus
type.
the
expense
in
both
dollars
and
cents
and
prosecutorial
time
in
dredging
up
old
cases
that
everybody
thought
had
long
been
in
repose,
some
15
or
20
years
old.
the
difficulty
of
finding
the
transcripts
of
the
cases
that
perhaps
were
not
appealed,
does
the
court
reporter
still
have
the
records,
if
she
or
he
has
died,
have
the
records
been
preserved.
how
in
the
world,
i
suppose
it
can
be
done
but
it
would
be
an
extremely
difficult,
costly
and
time
consuming
process.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
that
is
my
understanding
assuming
that
this
court
does
not
go
off
on
the
distinction
that
you
were
making
earlier
about
whether
this
was
properly
presented.
but
assuming
you
adopt
the
north
carolina
court?s
analysis,
yes.
now,
as
i
understand
it,
probably
the
first
degree
murder
convictions
would
survive
because
you
have
to
prove
the
element
of
premeditation
and
deliberation
on
the
felony
or
what
not
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
but
in
the
second
degree
case,
where
either
an
involuntary
manslaughter
issue
was
presented
or
a
self
defense
issue
was
presented
and
possibly
if
this
court
should
go
so
far
as
to
extend
this
doctrine
into
other
areas
such
as
entrapment
or
what
not
and
that
type
of
defense
was
raised
then
possibly
even
there.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
there
is
no
way
to
identify
these
numbers.
the
statistics
kept
by
the
prison
department
and
the
records
kept
by
the
prison
department
simply
do
not
permit
identification
of
this.
they
have
in
the
records
what
is
known
as
the
prisoner?s
version
of
what
happened
but
of
course
this
is
not
a
transcript
of
the
trial.
and
the
only
way
i
know
of
would
be
to
get
a
transcript
of
every
one
of
those
trials,
and
see
what
issues
were
presented.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
well,
we
are
talking
about
around
a
thousand
in
total.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
no,
my
recollection
is
that
we
are
talking
around
about
700
second
degree
type
or
below.
now,
of
course
some
of
these
people
might
be
out
on
parole
obviously
wherein
whether
or
not
they
would
have
a
right
to
raise
this
point.
what
we
are
saying
though
is
that
it
is
going
to
be
a
very
expensive,
difficult
and
time
consuming
manner.
that
would
have
a
devastating
impact
on
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
state
of
north
carolina.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
well,
that
is
what
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
in
hankerson
identified.
those
were
the
numbers
that
they
identified.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
right,
no,
i
do
not
think
we
will
have
any
problems
with
first
degree
people.
we
are
going
to
have
a
lot
of
problems
with
the
second
degree
people
and
any
type
of
self
defense
gets
into
that.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
no,
sir
we
did
not.
we
thought
about
it
and
finally
decided.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
well,
i
did
not
think
it
was
open
justice
white
until
i
heard
the
questions
this
morning.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
are
you
talking
about
the
fact
that
voluntary
manslaughter
was
not
properly
presented?
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
no,
i
did
not
because
first
of
all,
i
was
under
the
impression
that
i
was
bound
by
the
interpretation
of
my
court.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
certainly,
our
court
held
as
a
matter
of
state
law
that
there
was
absolutely
no
distinction
between
the
burden
of
proof
required
for
voluntary
manslaughter
and
the
burden
of
proof
required
for
self
defense.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
that
is
right.
quite
frankly,
i
just
did
not
perceive
this
to
be
a
problem
until
this
morning
and
i
thought
that
by
the
interpretation
of
our
state
court
and
secondly
in
the
trial
of
hankerson,
a
manslaughter
issue
was
presented
to
the
jury.
a
manslaughter
issue
was
presented;
a
self
defense
issue
was
presented.
therefore,
i
thought
by
having
both
issues
presented
to
the
jury
by
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
saying
there
all
the
same.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
it
may
very
well.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
precisely,
the
standard
in
north
carolina
which
is
proof
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
jury
is
the
same
in
both
of
these
matters.
and
our
state
court
has
so
held
and
as
i
understood
the
major
question
of
course
was
retroactivity.
the
ancillary
question
that
i
had
raised
in
my
brief
is
that
perhaps
the
mullaney
rules
do
not
even
apply
to
north
carolina
at
all.
that
perhaps
the
satisfaction
of
the
jury
test
means
something
less
than
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
yes
sir
and
of
course,
i
recognized
that
in
my
brief
that
i
may
very
well
be
foreclosed
from
this
argument.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
yes.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
this
would
be
my
distinction
that
they
interpreted
the
north
carolina
standard
in
view
of
what
you
gentlemen
had
said
the
constitution
means.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
precisely.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
not
deciding
a
question
of
what
satisfaction
of
the
jury
means
in
terms
of
north
carolina
law.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
that
was
my
feeling
justice
brennan
and
that
is
why
i
made
the
argument
of
course.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
excuse
me,
i
apologize
sir.
this
is
my
first
time
here,
my
little
list.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
that
was
the
north
carolina
question.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
quite
a
bit,
because
of
course
in
mullaney,
you
all
were
construing
a
rule
of
law
in
main,
that
as
i
understand
it
had
already
been
construed
by
the
main
supreme
court
and
of
course,
as
i
have
attempted
to
argue
in
my
brief,
the
north
carolina
rules
are
quite
a
bit
different
from
the
rules
in
main.
we
do
not
have
this
conclusive
presumption
of
malice,
and
i
guess
its
the
morgan
tradition
that
really
what
north
carolina
has
is
more
of
an
evidentiary
influence
of
malice,
that
when
certain
things
are
shown
then
the
influence
of
malice
arises
and
the
production
burden
then
is
shifted
on
the
defendant
to
come
forward
and
present
evidence.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
well,
certainly
up
until
about
15-20
minutes
ago
that
was
my
understanding
of
the
posture
of
the
case.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
yes,
certainly
it
is
my
feeling
that
there
was
some
evidence
in
the
case
and
of
course,
north
carolina
does
require
that
there
be
evidence
in
the
case
before
the
judge
instruct.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
that
it
was
not
properly
presented?
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
yes,
well,
i
do
not
quite
know
what
i
do
with
it
but
it
is
my
feeling
that
the
issue
is
here.
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
that
the
similarity
nay
the
identity
of
the
rules
of
law
and
the
standards
and
the
burdens
in
north
carolina.
i
feel
like
get
this
issue
up
here.
certainly,
the
trial
judge
thought
it
was
there.
he
instructed
that
jury
and
i
take
it
that
jury
could
have
returned
a
verdict
of
voluntary
manslaughter
under
the
instructions
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
33.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
33,
i
believe.
first
full
paragraph.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
well,
for
one
thing
on
this
issue
that
i
am
disagreeing
with,
it
seemed
like
to
me
that
the
court
was
applying
a
federal
principle
that
only
you
could
ultimately
decide
the
scope
of.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
no,
it
is
not
and
the
only
thing
i
can
tell
you
is
that
i
disagree
with
it.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
yes,
sir
and
i
feel
like
that
i
have
to
make
the
best
argument
i
can.
to
conclude
and
summarize,
that
the
state
is
more
concerned
about
the
potential
retroactive
application
of
your
mullaney
case.
this
is
what
we
are
most
gravely
concerned
about
and
if
this
court
could
some
how
find
its
way
clear
to
limit
the
retroactivity
of
mullaney,
the
state
of
north
carolina
would
be
very
happy
because
by
hankerson
hopefully,
we
have
cleaned
up
whatever
federal
constitutional
error
might
have
been
present
in
our
rooms.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
on
what
sir,
retroactivity?
of
course,
i
would
draw
the
line
as
of
the
date,
the
decision
was
handed
down
and
i
realized
this
is
a
source
of
great
controversy
and
that
you
draw
the
lines
at
varying
dates,
i
would
say
that
any
case
that
was
tried
to
a
conclusion
prior
to
the
date
of
mullaney
should
be
allowed
to
remain.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
well,
this
was
going
to
be
my
next
argument
and
by
way
of
summary
that
obviously
the
millennium
as
far
as
i
would
be
concerned
here
today
would
be
for
you
all
to
hold
that
mullaney
never
applied
to
north
carolina.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
yes
sir,
without
a
cross
petition.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
that
is
exactly
what
i
am
arguing.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
well,
all
i
am
saying
is
that
the
court
may
very
well
have
misperceived
and
construed
the
sweep
of
your
opinion
in
mullaney,
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
as
i
understand,
only
you
can
say
with
finality
that
the
sweep
of
your
opinion
possibly
may
apply
to
north
carolina.
as
a
representative
of
the
state,
i
feel
like
it
did
not,
i
feel
like
our
court
painted
with
too
broad
a
brush
with
your
mullaney
decision
and
i
feel
like
this
is
something
that
is
legitimate,
that
this
court
should
consider
when
it
decides
this
particular
case.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
i
can
not
say
that
there
is
any
distinction
myself.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
i
am
sorry
sir,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
well,
i
am
sorry
sir.
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
in
terms
of
state
law
concerning
the
burden
of
proof
on
those
two
affirmative
defenses.
as
i
understand
it
as
a
matter
of
state
law
there
is
no
different
between
the
two
and
so
far
as
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
between
self
defense
and
heat
of
passion.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
well,
i
would
argue
that
in
so
far
as
north
carolina
is
concerned,
where
the
burden
is
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
jury
on
both
of
those
affirmative
defenses
that
satisfying
the
jury
does
not
mean
convincing
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
that
is
what
i
thought
you
were
asking
a
while
ago
sir,
and
my
answer
is
that
i
do
not
see
any
distinction
either.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
well,
of
course
self
defense
goes
to
the
unlawfulness
issue
and
the
insanity
goes
to
the
malice
element.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
yes
sir,
it
does.
one
excuses
because
of
the
mental
condition,
the
other
excuses
because
of
the
threat
to
the
bodily
harm.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
it
is
a
justification
but
it
is
not
unlawful
as
what
you
are
saying
when
it
is
self
defense.
i
quite
frankly
can
see
no
distinction
but
you
do
have
of
course
your
leland
case
which
was
a
strange
procedural
animal
and
that
the
state
had
to
find
the
man
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
then
he
had
to
come
in
and
prove
himself
insane
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
of
course,
as
i
recall
the
opinion
you
said
that
was
alright
under
those
circumstances,
and
of
course
argon
has
long
since
done
away
with
that
procedure
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
charles
m.
hensey
the
one
problem
is
of
course
looking
at
the
text
writers,
is
that
there
seems
to
be
some
questions;
number
one
as
to
what
an
affirmative
defense
is?
what
do
you
categorize
as
that?
then
of
course
they
are
all
grades
and
shades
of
proof
once
you
decide
the
thing
is
an
affirmative
defense.
i
cannot
give
you
a
rational
distinction
between
the
insanity
problem
and
the
heat
of
passion
or
self
defense
problem
except
to
say
that
it
is
there
and
apparently
this
court
at
one
time
or
another
has
made
those
distinctions.
thank
you
very
much.
