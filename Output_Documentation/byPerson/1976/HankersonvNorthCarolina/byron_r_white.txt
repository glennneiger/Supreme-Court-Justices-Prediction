justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
hensey,
the
state
did
not
cross
petition
here,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
then
the
question
of
whether
mullaney
reach
his
self
defense
just
does
not
open
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
did
not
think
that
you
must
have
sought
mullaney
covered
it.
i
am
talking
about
a
matter
of
jurisdiction,
not
a
matter
whether
we
may
properly
decide
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
talking
about
the
fact
that
your
supreme
court
said
that
mullaney
applied
self
defense.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
did
not
cross
petition
challenging
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
mean
is
a
matter
of
whether
you
had
the
authority
to
attack
your
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
why
you
might
not,
but
the
fact
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
of
whether
mullaney
covers
self
defense
in
north
carolina
that
issue
just
is
not
here,
you
did
not
petition
raising
it,
and
certainly
your
colleague
--
and
to
support
the
judgment
you
are
not
entitled
to
present
it
either
because
that
will
give
you
a
bigger
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
applicability
of
mullaney
to
self
defense
may
vary
depending
on
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
here
the
reason
you
sought
was
a
closed
issue,
was
that
your
court
rule
that
self
defense
and
provocation
should
be
treated
the
same
in
terms
of
burden
of
proof.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
that
point
were
you
not
arguing
the
same
thing
that
the
concurrent
opinion
argued?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
we
not
have
to
interpret
the
majority
as
having
rejected
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
a
north
carolina
law
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
general
hensey,
may
i
just
define
that
a
little
bit?
is
it
not
correct
that
the
court
decided
a
federal
question
as
to
what
mullaney
requires
for
the
future
and
then
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
affirm
this
conviction,
they
had
to
decide
as
a
matter
of
north
carolina
law
what
the
instruction
of
the
jury
on
satisfaction
properly
meant
and
that
was
the
north
carolina
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
differed
from
the
federal
requirements.
justice
byron
r.
white
general
hensey,
let
me
us
ask,
one
other
question.
do
you
agree
with
your
opponent
that
the
heat
of
passion
element
is
in
fact
presented
by
this
record
under
the
manslaughter
part
as
opposed
to
the
self
defense
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
evidence
of
the
knife
at
the
throat
will
be
sufficient
to
raise
that
face
of
the
case
as
well
the
self
defense.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
do
with
what
the
supreme
court
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
was
no
evidence,
i
have
read
the
--
you
heard
the
passage.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
hankerson
case
is
here
from
the
state
courts
in
north
carolina.
it
also
relates
to
mullaney
against
wilbur.
the
north
carolina
court
held
that
that
decision
was
not
retroactive
and
did
not
apply
to
cases
that
had
been
decided
or
--
or
held
that
it
--
it
was
not
retroactive
and
did
not
apply
to
cases
that
have
been
decided
prior
to
our
decision
in
that
case.
we
reversed
in
our
view
under
our
prior
cases
even
if
retroactivity,
mullaney
against
wilbur,
is
indeed
retroactive.
mr.
justice
blackmun
while
joining
the
opinions
of
the
court
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
the
chief
justice
has
joined
him.
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
powell
have
each
filed
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
and
decision
of
the
case.
