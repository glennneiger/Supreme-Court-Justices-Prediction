unknown
speaker
in
this
case
under
the
prior
north
carolina
law
until
changed
by
the
supreme
court
in
this
case,
there
were
two
separate
matters
in
which
the
purpose
of
persuasion
at
least
was
shifted
to
the
defendant.
first,
the
absence
of
malice
which
would
reduce
the
homicide
to
manslaughter.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
second,
the
question
of
self
defense
which
if
true
or
if
the
jury
was
satisfied
by
the
defendant
would
wholly
acquit
the
defendant.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
and
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
that
treated
them
both
alike
and
as
both
covered
by
mullaney,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
both
were
involve
in
this
particular
case?
unknown
speaker
yet
mullaney
did
not
involve
any
matter
that
would
have
been
on
complete
defense
to
any
charge
of
homicide,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
that
is
self
defense
as
in
this
case
or
insanity
as
in
the
ivan
case
or
someone.
unknown
speaker
but
it
did
not
say
that
that
rule
is
constitutionally
required,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
one
involves
elements
of
the
offense
that
state
has
to
prove
and
the
other
involves
an
affirmative
defense
to
the
commission
of
any
crime
and
that
would
be
duress
or
insanity
or
self
defense
depending
upon
the
crime.
unknown
speaker
but
as
a
matter
of
that
is
correct,
is
it
not?
one
does
involve
mitigations
of
the
degree
of
the
homicide
and
the
other
does
involve
a
complete
exoneration
of
any
criminal
offense.
that
is
correct.
unknown
speaker
but
unlawfulness
is
an
element
of
manslaughter.
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
unlawfulness
if
it
is
self
defense.
there
is
no
unlawfulness
if
it
is
a
killing
in
a
course
of
warfare
or
legal
execution
or
by
somebody
who
is
insane.
there
is
just
no
unlawfulness,
correct?
unknown
speaker
mr.
diedrick,
do
you
think
this
sudden
passion
point
is
here
at
all?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
your
supreme
court
on
that
particular
point,
the
court
said
is
a
matter
state
law,
there
wasn?t
any
evidence
at
all
of
the
heat
of
passion
and
so
the
issue
was
not
even
before
them.
unknown
speaker
it
says
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
we
know
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
of
the
killing
in
the
heat
of
passion
on
sudden
provocation,
therefore,
this
issue
is
not
properly
presented
as
was
in
mullaney.
there
could
not
consequently
be
any
mullaney
error
prejudicial
to
the
defendant
on
this
aspect
of
the
case.
do
you
say
that
it
is
unconstitutional
for
a
court
to
demand
at
least
that
the
defendant
present
some
evidence,
at
least
present
the
issue?
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
they
ruled
it
or
they
were
not.
let's
just
--
what
i
am
really
asking
you,
suppose
the
court
was
right
here
that
defendant
had
not
presented
any
evidence
of
it
but
that
he
had
to
or
his
heat
of
passion
defense
would
not
be
any
good.
would
that
be
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
now
you
are
on
the
heat
of
passion
point,
the
only
way
it
could
properly
be
here
is
if
we
disagreed
with
your
supreme
court
on
the
facts.
unknown
speaker
well,
your
supreme
court
did
not
think
so.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
defendant
does
not
have
to
present
any
evidence
of
any
kind
with
respect
to
the
heat
of
passion
issue?
unknown
speaker
so
you
rely
on
the
state?s
evidence
not
on
any
facts
introduced
on
behalf
of
the
defense?
unknown
speaker
and
you
disagree
with
finding
of
the
north
carolina
court
as
pointed
out
by
justice
white?
unknown
speaker
if
we
should
agree
with
the
finding
of
the
north
carolina
supreme
court,
would
the
retroactivity
issue
still
remain
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
we
have
never
held
the
mullaney
(inaudible)
applied
to
self
defense?
unknown
speaker
mullaney
is
retroactive
because
of
winship.
unknown
speaker
so
your
view
is
that
the
retroactivity
issue
remains
in
any
event?
unknown
speaker
these
would
involve
all
who
were
convicted
of
second
degree
murder
and
even
all
who
were
convicted
of
manslaughter
if
a
defense
of
self
defense
had
been
interposed.
unknown
speaker
well,
just
down
there,
within
the
meets
and
bounds
of
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
would
be
every
second
degree
murder
conviction
in
which
involuntary
manslaughter
defense
or
mitigation
was
an
issue
and
also
even
a
manslaughter
conviction
in
which
a
self
defense
was
an
issue.
how
many
--
unknown
speaker
how
many
gross
numbers
are
involved?
unknown
speaker
that
is
second
degree
of
manslaughter
conviction.
unknown
speaker
your
brief
states
that
there
are
722
inmates
as
of
june
10,
1975
who
had
been
convicted
of
second
degree
murder
and
you
have
cited
a
north
carolina
case?
unknown
speaker
in
addition
to
269
inmates
convicted
of
first
degree.
unknown
speaker
mr.
justice
stevens
is
looking
at
the
appendix.
how
do
you
make
the
judgment
to
disagree
with
your
court
on
this
issue
and
accept
the
judgment
of
your
court
on
other
issues?
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
you
right
there,
that
the
sentence
mr.
justice
white
read
to
you
says,
we
note
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
of
a
killing
in
the
heat
of
passion
and
that
is
probably
a
federal
question,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
you
are
representing
the
state?
unknown
speaker
where
would
you
draw
the
line?
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
north
carolina
would
even
be
happier
and
would
be
more
interested
in
urging
that
mullaney
did
not
apply
at
all.
unknown
speaker
but
then
you
take
that
position
without
a
cross
petition?
unknown
speaker
you
can
take
it,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
you
really
are
not
making
a
very
powerful
argument.
unknown
speaker
the
question
is,
if
you
were
permitted
to
argue
that
there
should
be
a
distinction
drawn
between
self
defense
and
heat
of
passion
for
mullaney
purposes,
then
i
would
say,
well,
what
is
the
argument
and
i
thought
you
said
i
do
not
have
an
argument.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
different
as
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
that
you
would
urge
us
to
consider?
unknown
speaker
when
the
burden
as
a
matter
state
law
is
identical
with
respect
to
both
of
those
matters?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
but
that
the
argument
applies
equally
to
heat
of
passion
and
to
self
defense.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
principled
reason
for
distinguishing
between
heat
of
passion
and
self
defense
as
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law?
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
signed
on
and
mr.
justice
white
in
effect
has
raised
question,
well,
maybe
there
is
one
that
we
have
not
discussed.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
difference
between
self
defense
and
insanity
as
an
affirmative
defense?
unknown
speaker
each
one
of
them
goes
to
the
basic
question
of
whether
or
not
a
criminal
homicide
has
been
committed.
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
a
justification.
unknown
speaker
but
there
are
many,
many
cases
in
states
in
which
insanity
remains
an
affirmative
defense
to
be
pleaded
and
proved
by
the
defendant.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
has
separated
the
first
degree,
i
thought
from
the
second
degree
of
manslaughter.
unknown
speaker
somebody
who
pleaded
guilty
would
have
pleaded
guilty
with
the
knowledge
and/or
the
advice
of
his
lawyer
as
to
what
then
state
of
the
north
carolina
law
was,
and
that
he
could
certainly
collaterally
attack
that
guilty
plea,
could
he
not
if
these
were
made
retroactive?
because
now
the
law
has
been
changed
and
he
could
probably
say
he
would
never
have
pleaded
guilty
if
it
had
been
incumbent
upon
the
state
to
prove
these
things
rather
than
upon
himself.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
undoubtedly
what
the
state
would
argue
but
there
is
certainly
an
argument
on
the
other
side,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
even
attacking
a
guilty
plea.
