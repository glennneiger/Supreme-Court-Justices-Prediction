mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
here
representing
johnny
hankerson
who
is
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
to
petition
this
court
for
certiorari
from
a
supreme
court
decision
in
north
carolina
against
him.
the
question
we
content
and
present
it
here
is
where
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
erred
in
not
applying
mullaney
retroactively.
since
the
doctrine
of
mullaney
as
relates
to
petitioner?s
case
greatly
affected
the
fact
finding
process,
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process.
the
state
court
held
that
by
raising
the
decision
of
mullaney,
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibits
the
use
of
their
long
standing
rules
in
homicide
cases,
that
a
defendant
in
order
to
rebut
the
presumption
of
malice
must
prove
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
jury
that
he
killed
in
the
heat
of
sudden
passion
and
to
rebut
the
presumption
of
unlawfulness
that
he
killed
in
self
defense.
they
held
that
those
instructions
as
they
were
given
in
our
case
violated
the
concept
to
due
process
announced
by
this
court
in
mullaney.
however,
they
decline
without
further
guidance
from
this
court
to
apply
it
retroactively.
the
petitioner
contends
that
the
main
determination
to
be
made
by
this
court
in
whether
or
not
to
give
mullaney
retroactivity
is
whether
or
not
the
major
purpose
of
the
new
constitutional
doctrine
as
to
over
come
an
aspect
of
a
criminal
trial
that
substantially
impairs
its
truth
finding
function.
the
petitioner
contends
that
in
order
to
do
that
this
court
must
closely
scrutinize
the
major
purpose
which
it
held
mullaney
to
serve.
this
court
in
its
opinion
on
mullaney
relied
heavily
on
winship.
this
court
further,
in
ivan
held
winship
to
be
retroactive.
however,
the
petitioner
contends
that
this
court
in
its
own
language
in
mullaney,
said
that
the
rule
that
--
whether
the
major
purposes
of
mullaney
was
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
requirements
of
the
burden
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
being
carried
by
the
prosecution
in
criminal
cases.
it
went
on
further
to
say
that
this
major
purpose
to
be
served
by
this
rule
was
at
even
greater
purpose
than
that
which
was
set
forth
in
winship
and
i
quote
from
mr.
justice
powell?s
opinion
at
page
700.
?not
only
are
the
interests
underlying
winship
implicated
to
a
greater
degree
in
this
case,
but
in
one
respect
the
protection
afforded
those
interests
less
here".
in
winship
the
ultimate
burden
of
persuasion
remained
with
the
prosecution
although
the
standard
had
been
reduced
to
proof
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
in
this
case,
that
is
in
the
mullaney
case,
by
contrast
that
state
has
affirmatively
shifted
the
burden
of
proof
to
defendant.
the
result
in
a
case
such
as
this
one
where
the
defendant
is
required
to
prove
the
critical
fact
in
dispute
is
to
increase
further
the
likelihood
of
an
erroneous
murder
conviction.
therefore,
the
petitioner
contends
that
this
court
has
already
held
in
its
decision
of
mullaney
that
the
major
purpose
to
be
served
by
that
rule
was
to
correct
an
error
in
the
fact
finding
process,
because
they
have
stated
this
to
increase
further
likelihood
and
rated
as
to
do
away
with
the
increase
of
the
further
likelihood
of
an
erroneous
murder
conviction.
of
necessity
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
apply
any
of
these
new
constitutional
rules
retroactively,
the
court
must
look
at
prior
decisions
and
whether
or
not
they
have
given
those
decisions
perspective
only
or
retroactive
applications.
however,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
contends
that
you
need
only
look
to
ivan
as
far
as
it
relates
to
the
case
of
the
bar,
because
of
the
fact
that
mullaney
says
that
the
interest
to
be
protected
in
mullaney
itself
are
greater
than
those
on
winship.
that,
here,
it
is
not
only
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
be
protected
but
further
that
it
places
the
burden
solely
on
the
state
to
carry
this
burden.
that
is
to
say
in
the
winship
case
it
was
proved
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
but
at
all
time
that
proof
rested
solely
upon
the
prosecution.
in
mullaney,
it
removes
that
burden
of
proof
or
the
main
rule
which
was
corrected
by
this
court
in
mullaney,
move
that
burden
of
proof
or
shift
to
that
burden
of
proof
to
the
defendant.
in
the
main
case,
or
the
mullaney
case,
this
court
stated
that
in
main
itself,
the
prosecution
was
required
to
prove
the
absence
of
self
defense
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
in
north
carolina
until
the
hankerson
decision,
that
is
the
case
which
is
at
the
bar,
the
defendant
himself
had
to
satisfy
the
jury
that
he
did
act
in
self
defense.
that
is
to
say
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
shifted
from
the
state
to
the
defendant
to
come
forward
and
satisfy
the
jury
of
the
four
things
necessary
for
them
to
return
the
verdict
of
acquittal
on
the
grounds
of
self
defense.
so,
the
petitioner
honestly
contends
that
while
a
review
of
all
of
the
other
cases
involving
retroactivity
and
being
applied
perspectively
is
important.
this
court
need
look
no
further
than
the
language
of
mullaney
and
applying
it
with
ivan
and
winship.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
from
second
degree
murder
to
manslaughter.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
yes
it
did.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
it
did
not
but
i
would
argue
that
it
addressed
self
defense.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
it
did
not
directly
but
i
would
argue
that
it
did
direct
itself
to
that
by
stating
that
main
had
already
had
the
rule
which
required
the
state
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
the
absence
of
self
defense.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
it
did
not,
but
it
analogized
it
to
the
rule
of
proving
heat
of
passion
and
held
that
to
be
the
way,
main
had
it
constitutionally
prohibited.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
i
would
argue
differently,
your
honor,
i
would
tell
the
court
that
one
of
the
necessary?
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
they
both
require
the
absence
of
elements
in
order
to
rebut
the
presumption
of
unlawfulness
and
unlawfulness
is
an
element
of
homicide
in
north
carolina.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
that
is
correct,
but
by
statutory
and
by
case
law
definition
of
homicide
in
north
carolina,
an
element
of
it
is
not
the
lack
of
insanity
whereas
an
element
of
the
offense
in
north
carolina
is
unlawfulness.
therefore,
i
would
argue
to
you
that
the
judgment
of
acquittal
or
virtue
a
plea
of
self
defense
is
a
negative
of
a
necessary
element.
that
is
the
elements
are
both
malice
and
unlawfulness,
not
the
lack
of
insanity.
that
is
not
an
element.
both
of
these
address
themselves
to
defenses
involving
these
elements
and
i
would
argue
to
you
that
the
north
carolina
court
in
adapting
mullaney
and
making
it
applicable
to
our
law
properly
did
so
because
it
says
that
this
element
of
unlawfulness
used
to
not
be
inferred
but
it
was
actually
presumed
and
that
it
was
up
from
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon
and
it
was
up
to
the
defendant
to
rebut
that
presumption
through
self
defense.
and
that
the
elements
of
malice
was
actually
presumed
from
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon
and
this
had
to
be
rebutted
by
the
defendant
through
the
use
of
his
defense
of
heat
of
sudden
passion.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
do
i
believe
it
is
properly
raised
by
the
facts?
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
i
did
not
understand
it
to
be
that
way,
your
honor,
i
thought
they
held
that?
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
well,
i
am
arguing
that
there
was
that
issue
presented
by
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
i
think
it
was,
i
think
the
mullaney
decision
said
when
properly
presented.
it
has
to
be
facts.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
would
argue
to
the
court
that
defense
certainly
should
be
available
or
actually
not
the
defense,
the
lack
of
it
should
be
available
when
a
knife
is
put
at
somebody?s
throat.
that
certainly
should
be
fact
sufficient
from
which
heat
of
passion
could
arise.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
well,
i
would
disagree
with
the
supreme
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
i
would
say
that
if
the
state?s
evidence
in
itself
would
present
facts
from
which
this
could
arise
but
here
the
main
thrust
of
the
state?s
case
was
a
exculpatory
statement.
that
is
statements
made
by
the
defendant
himself,
his
confession,
his
statement
of
how
the
incident
occurred
in
his
own
statement
brought
forward.
i
would
argue
the
defense
was
self
defense
and
the
presence
of
the
heat
of
passion,
therefore,
the
absence
of
malice
which
would
require
these
to
be
properly
submitted
to
the
jury.
to
answer
your
question,
certainly
there
could
be
instances
and
there
are
many
instances
in
which
these
two
things
are
not
really
an
issue.
that
the
facts
do
not
properly
raise
it
but
certainly
the
state?s
evidence,
not
only
in
this
case
but
in
many
cases
brings
those
forward.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
i
would
rely
on
both,
but
i
would
say
that
the
state?s
evidence
in
this
case
properly
brought
forward
those
issues.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
yes,
i
disagree
because
i
think
that
as
i
answer
justice
white,
that
any
time
you
have
a
factual
situation
that
shows
a
knife
being
put
at
somebody?s
throat,
certainly
the
offense
of
heat
of
passion
could
probably
be
raised.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
i
would
argue
it
would
because
it
was
self
defense.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
i
would
say
the
language
is
the
same,
if
it
please
the
court,
it
is
negating
of
a
necessary
element,
and
in
mullaney.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
in
mullaney
itself
they
spoke
of
the
fact
that
main
in
the
past,
place
the
burden
on
the
state
to
prove
the
absence
of
self
defense
from
the
evidence
of
beyond
reasonable
doubt,
and
saying
that
absence
of
the
heat
of
passion
would
be
no
greater
burden.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
yes
sir.
i
think
the
main
thing
that
i
am
trying
to
point
out
is
that
when
you
talk
about
insanity
or
alibi
or
anything
like
that,
you
are
not
talking
of
elements,
you
are
not
speaking
of
elements
of
the
offense.
both
malice
and
unlawfulness
are
elements
of
the
offense
of
homicide
which
the
state
by
its
charge
in
this
case
placed
the
burden
on
the
defendant
to
satisfy
the
jury
of
the
absence
of,
and
that
is
why
we
would
argue
it
is
constitutionally
prohibited.
it
would
have
necessity
in
light
of
ivan
and
winship
have
to
substantially
affect
the
fact
finding
process
and
therefore
fortunately
be
given
full
retroactivity.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
i
just
wanted
to
reply
in
rebuttal
to
his
argument
with
reference
to
the
severe
impact
it
would
have
on
the
administration
of
justice.
now,
i
do
not
have
available
to
me
any
statistics
of
any
state
except
for
north
carolina
which
are
present
in
his
brief
and
which
our
court
addressed
itself
to.
however,
i
think
this
statistics
are
un-meaningful
without
some
type
of
guidance
as
to
the
number
of
those
which
are
pleas,
the
number
of
those
which
were
pleas
and
not
guilty,
the
number
of
those
which
are
actually
first
degree
convictions,
which
are
second
degree
convictions,
which
are
manslaughter
convictions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
i
understood
that
he
had
but
i
am
saying
that
before
you
can
meaningfully
answer
that
question
you
have
to
make
that
determination
having
all
of
that
criteria
available
to
you
and
most
importantly
which
ones
were
upon
pleas
of
not
guilty
and
which
ones
were
pleas
of
guilty.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
but
if
that
defense
of
self
defense
was
available
to
him,
i
would
argue
to
you
whether
under
the
state
law
was
then
affirmed
by
the
defense
was
a
burden
upon
him
or
whether
it
was
not
an
affirmed
defense
that
yes
he
would
have
had
to
--
with
the
counsel
who
made
the
determination
whether
or
not
the
defense
was
available
to
him
but
i
would
argue
to
you
that
his
plea
of
guilty
was
a
waiver.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
there
could
be,
yes
sir.
mr.
lawrence
g.
diedrick
there
could
be.
but
the
thing
that
i
really
would
argue
is
this,
if
you
take
a
factual
situation
like
my
case,
the
case
at
the
bar
in
which
all
of
the
evidence
is
primarily
exculpatory
evidence
which
is
statements
of
the
defendant
wherein
he
clearly
brought
forward
lack
of
malice
on
his
part,
i
would
argue,
which
he
clearly
brought
forward
lack
of
unlawfulness
because
of
the
defense
of
self
defense.
reviewing
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
the
case
and
weighing
everything
equally,
i
certainly
argue
to
the
court
that
the
charge
of
the
court
in
this
case
substantially
affected
the
fact
finding
process.
if
there
are
these
728
other
cases,
3
or
4
or
10
which
would
have
properly
brought
this
forward
and
it
makes
no
difference
how
severe
an
impact
it
would
have
on
the
administration
of
justice,
it
should
be
done
because
i
would
argue
to
you
these
people
were
unconstitutionally
convicted,
that
they
did
not
receive
a
fair
trial,
that
they
had
a
constitutionally
prohibited
burden
placed
upon
them
and
regardless
of
the
severe
impact
should
be
made
available
to
them.
thank
you.
