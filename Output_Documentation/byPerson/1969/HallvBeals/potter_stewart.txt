although,
if
it
had
been
two
month
at
the
time
you
wanted
to
vote,
you
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
bring
this
lawsuit,
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
could've
voted.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
--
well,
we
both
know
there's
a
mootness
question
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
i
presume
you'll
address
yourself
to
it.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it,
you
would
say
that
it's
some
sort
of
a
burden,
and
i
gather
you
think
a
rather
heavy
burden
on
a
state
to
show
a
need
for
this
sort
of
a
residence
requirement.
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
in
view
of
article
2
section
1
and
of
the
twelfth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
--
justice
potter
stewart
which,
effectively
provides
that
this
is
up
to
each
state
legislature,
why
do
you
think
the
state
has
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
bestow
such
a
burden?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
right
of
free
interstate
travel,
of
course,
is
a
constitutional
right,
as
has
been
held
--
justice
potter
stewart
repeatedly
and
very
recently
by
this
court.
that
the
--
i
don't
know
that
it's
ever
--
i
know,
so
far
as
i
do
know,
that
it's
never
been
held
that
the
right
to
vote
is
a
constitutional
right,
a
federal
constitutional
right.
in
fact,
there
are
statements
that
it
is
not.
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
same
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
contrary,
is
it
not,
both
to
the
original
theory
of
the
constitution
of
article
2
section
1
as
well,
i
suppose,
to
statistical
fact
even
in
modern
contemporary
elections?
whole
areas
will
go
--
a
series
of
states
will
be
for
one
candidate
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
another
area
is
for
another,
and
i
said
--
and
can't
--
you
mean,
you
cannot
concede
that
a
person
who
is
familiar
with
a
particular
problem,
say,
of
the
western
slope
of
the
rocky
mountains
in
colorado
might
be
quite
differently
attuned
to
a
national
election
based
upon
the
candidate's
views
of
some
of
the
issues
that
my
brother
white
has
mentioned
-
reclamation,
conservation,
water.
then,
that
same
person
might
be,
if
he
lived
in
the
lower
east
side
of
new
york
city
and
they
--
justice
potter
stewart
are
attuned
and
familiar
with
the
problems
of
that
sort
of
an
urban
society?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know,
but
the
--
one
of
the
justifications
asserted
here
is
that
a
state
has
an
interest
and
a
right
in
seeing
to
it
that
its
voters
are
familiar
with
local
problems,
and
it's
your
submission,
as
i
understand
it
that
local
problems
or
local
impact,
if
you
will,
of
national
issues
is
of
absolutely
no
relevance
whatever.
justice
potter
stewart
when
you
say
that
the
decision
in
drueding
doesn
--
against
devlin
doesn't
necessitate
a
decision
against
you,
what
--
i
suppose
you
do
concede
we
have
to
overrule
drueding
in
order
to
decide
this
case
in
your
favor,
would
we
not?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
we'd
have
to
overrule
that
decision
in
order
to
rule
in
this
case
in
your
favor,
assuming
this
case
is
not
moot,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we'd
have
to
overrule
it.
justice

stewart
well,
whatever
obstacle
that
might
constitute
for

justice

stewart
various
members
of

court.

you're
not

you're

the
--
excuse
me.
i'm
not
sure
you
were
finished.
justice

stewart
there's
no
very
clear
definition
that
i
can
find
in
your
complaint
or
elsewhere
as
to
the
class
that
you
purportedly
represent.
you
talk
about
other
similarly
situated
and
that
could
be
giving

justice
potter
stewart
a
broad
or
a
narrow
definition.
justice
potter
stewart
wherever
--
in
any
of
the
50
states?
justice
potter
stewart
really,
you
represent,
i
suppose
you
might
assert,
every
adult
in
the
united
states
because
anybody
in
any
state
might
want
to
move
--
justice
potter
stewart
probably
before
the

election.
justice

do
you
represent
