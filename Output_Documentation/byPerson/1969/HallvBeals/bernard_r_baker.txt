mr.
bernard
r.
baker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
briefly
introduce
my
associates
who
have
worked
with
me
in
this
case,
mr.
carol
moltz,
deputy
district
attorney
of
alpasa
county,
colorado
and
the
district
attorney,
mr.
robert
russell.
gentlemen,
colorado
is
not
trying
to
disenfranchise
anyone.
colorado
is
merely
trying
to
protect
the
electoral
process
for
presidential
elections.
colorado,
in
furtherance
of
a
constitutionally
delegated
responsibility
under
article
2
section,
colorado,
in
furtherance
of
that
responsibility,
has
enacted
legislation,
of
course,
the
history
of
the
legislation
going
back
to
the
time
when
it
in
fact
became
a
state.
and,
this
legislation's
primary
purpose
is
to
protect
the
purity
of
the
election
process
in
keeping
with
the
constitution.
colorado
maintains
that
when
there
is
responsibility
delegated
under
the
constitution,
in
this
case
article
2
section
1,
that
there
must
be
the
corresponding
authority
to
carry
out
the
responsibility
and
do
it
in
an
equitable
way,
a
reasonable
way.
and,
we
maintain
that
this
is
what
colorado
has
done.
your
honors,
before
i
get
into
the
substance
of
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
clarify
the
colorado
election
law.
it
has
been
misstated.
the
colorado
election
law
at
issue,
colorado
revised
statutes
49-24-1,
with
reference
to
the
three-day
that
mr.
--
three
days
that
mr.
hall
makes
reference
to,
your
honors,
these
three
days
refers
to
the
time
when
a
new
resident
can
vote.
he
must
vote
three
days
precedent
to
the
regular
election
under
colorado
law
because
a
special
polling
place
has
been
setup
for
him
since
they
are
in
a
status
by
themselves,
since
our
general
requirement
is
one
year
for
our
local
elections.
we,
like
many
states,
have
enacted
a
special
legislation
for
presidential
and
vice-presidential
electors.
and,
under
that
special
provision
of
the
election,
the
new
resident
casts
his
vote,
applies
for
his
ballot
not
later
than
three
days
before
the
elections
for
president.
however,
as
the
law
reads,
such
new
resident
must
have
been
dully
registered
as
required
by
the
provisions
of
this
article.
this
throws
back
to
the
general
registration
provision,
namely
20
days,
so
a
new
resident
must
have
registered
to
vote
in
order
to
pick
up
his
ballot.
the
--
three-day
prior
to
election,
he
must
have
been
registered
20
days
prior
to
the
election
as
every
other
elector
in
the
state.
so,
we're
talking
about
20
days
where
the
registration
is
cut
off.
the
new
resident
must
comply
with
that
also.
so,
colorado
has
not
cut
themselves
down
to
three
days
in
view
of
their
two-month
residency
requirement
for
new
residents.
we
also
would
contend
that
mr.
hall
does
not
represent
even
a
class
in
colorado.
on
october
22,
1968,
after
filing
his
original
complaint
on
october
4,
1968,
mr.
hall
filed
a
motion
that
he
be
considered
a
member
of
the
class.
this
was
done
on
october
22,
1968.
the
district
court
never
ruled
as
to
whether
he
was
or
was
not
representative
of
a
class.
the
motion
was
never
ruled
upon.
therefore,
we
would
have
to
say,
under
the
law,
since
he
wasn't
affirmatively
declared
by
the
district
court
representative
of
a
class,
that
he
is
not
in
fact
representative
of
a
class
in
the
state
of
colorado.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
he
is
dully
registered
to
vote
now.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
and
becomes
a
resident
of
another
state.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
your
honor,
two
months.
he
would
then
once
again,
having
lost
his
residency,
have
to
pick
it
up
once
again
and
be
such
a
resident
for
two
months
prior
to
the
election.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
not
if
he
returned
within
30
days
and
established
a
new
residency
in
colorado
at
that
time.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
your
honor,
we
certainly
declare
that
this
case
--
maintain
that
this
case
is
moot
as
to
all
of
the
issues.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
he
can
litigate
it
as
he
did
at
the
district
court
level.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
your
honor,
i
would
feel
that
the
suit
should
have
been
filed
in
a
timely
manner
so
that
time
could've
been
allowed
for
review,
although
your
point
is
certainly
well
taken,
mr.
justice
marshall,
namely
that
it
would
be
very
difficult.
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
the
matter
to
be
heard
when
the
suit
is
filed
in
october
and
the
election
is
held
in
november.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
no,
sir.
now,
going
to
this
mootness
question,
we
rely
upon
the
authority
of
the
landmark
case
of
mills
v.
green.
that
case
holding
of
course
that
it
was
now
impossible
to
grant
any
effectual
relief
and
that
did
involve
an
election,
the
old
mills
v.
green
case
decided
in
1895
by
this
court.
and,
i'm
sure
the
court
is
well
aware
of
the
law
in
this
case
that
when
it's
impossible
to
give
an
effective
remedy
because
of
changed
conditions,
the
court
is
reluctant,
well,
in
this
case
says
“we'll
not
consider
--
we'll
not
proceed
to
a
formal
judgment
but
we'll
dismiss
the
appeal.”
your
honors,
in
view
of
the
six-month
amendment
down
to
two
months,
we
feel
this
is
really
the
telling
point
in
this
case.
colorado,
by
its
legislative
enactment
on
april
23
of
this
year,
amended
their
statute
down
to
two
months.
apparently,
the
legislature
of
colorado
themselves
thought
that
action
needed
to
be
taken
to
lower
that
requirement.
they
took
such
action,
signed
in
the
law.
we
now
have
a
two-month
requirement.
and,
under
the
precedence
of
this
court,
namely
the
carpenter
v.
wabash
railway
case,
309
us
23
at
1940
and
the
hines
v.
davidowitz
outlined
in
our
brief
at
312
us
52
1941
case,
this
court
held
that
when
a
subsequent
legislative
enactment
occurs
which
has
a
bearing
upon
a
case,
the
case,
when
it
goes
up
on
appeal,
must
be
considered
in
light
of
the
subsequent
legislative
enactment.
and,
therefore,
the
issue
before
this
court
now
is
really
moving
into
the
equal
protection
argument,
the
reasonableness
of
two
months.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
no,
your
honor.
six
months
was
the
basis
of
the
federal
court
decision
in
denver
in
october
of
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
they
held
the
six
months
reasonable,
your
honor,
yes.
we
go
back
to
the
constitution
itself.
we
don't
feel
that
any
part
of
the
constitution
should
be
downgraded,
as
the
term
was
used
here.
with
--
the
constitution
is
a
living
instrument
all
alive,
and
article
2
section
1,
of
course,
gives
the
states
the
power,
the
responsibility
to
establish
voter
qualifications,
both
in
federal
and
state
elections.
now,
with
this
constitutional
prerogative,
many
cases
of
course
have
interpreted
this
prerogative
and
have
not
downgraded
this
prerogative
one
iota.
this
is
a
viable
prerogative,
a
responsibility.
going
as
far
back
of
course
as
pope
v.
williams
and
miner
v.
happersett,
1875
case,
pope
v.
williams
1904,
and
then
working
forward
all
away
up
to
drueding
v.
devlin
where
drueding
took
this
same
case,
the
same
facts,
almost
identical.
the
issue
is
certainly
identical.
there,
a
one-year
residency
requirement
in
the
state
of
maryland
was
held
--
affirmed
per
curium
by
this
court
in
march
of
1965,
upholding
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
district
of
maryland.
and,
the
district
court
in
maryland
said
that
the
one-year
is
not
unreasonable.
now,
i'm
not
going
to
argue
for
one
year.
i'm
not
really
going
to
argue
for
six
months.
colorado
argues
for
the
present
law.
colorado
--
el
paso
county,
colorado
is
the
appellee
in
this
case
and
we
have
a
two-month
law
and
we
are
here
to
uphold
that
law.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
there
was
some
mention
made
to
that.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
i
recall
there
was
some
reference
to
that,
mr.
justice
marshall.
and
who
knows
what
the
motives
of
our
legislature
were?
i
certainly
do
not.
i
do
know
that
they
changed
this
law
and
colorado,
of
course,
is
not
unhappy
that
it
was
changed
to
two
months.
now,
going
from
this
fundamental
power
that
rests
with
the
states,
we
move
to
the
traditional
equal
protection
test.
is
there
a
rational
relationship?
what
state
interest
is
colorado
trying
to
protect
here?
very
briefly,
your
honors,
if
i
may
refer
to
our
brief.
the
interest
that
colorado
is
furthering
is,
one,
to
preserve
the
purity
of
the
elections
to
identify
the
voter
so
that
double
voting
could
be
prevented.
picture
the
situation
of
a
manhattan
precinct
and
newark,
new
jersey
across
the
hudson
and
greenwich,
connecticut
up
the
line
a
short
distance
away.
where,
if
there
were
no
state
residency
requirements
whatsoever,
there
would
be
no
check
upon
wholesale
moving
across
state
lines.
we
really
feel
this
is
a
legitimate
view.
and,
if
there
were
no
residency
requirements
whatsoever,
our
state
lines
would
be
a
mecca
for
voter
fraud.
we
really
feel
this.
now,
if
one
day
is
not
sufficient
to
ensure
some
check
on
a
boarder,
how
can
we
say
that
two
months
is
unreasonable?
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
but
the
criminal
penalty
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
afraid
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
he
would
be
punishable,
but
the
election
would
be
over
and,
no
doubt,
the
electoral
college
would've
met
on
december
5
of
the
particular
presidential
election
year
and
we
would
have
an
election
on
the
books.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
two
months
is
necessary,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
we
have
a
new
resident
coming
into
the
state.
as
a
new
resident,
he
of
course
has
a
residence.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
well,
we
feel
that
tying
all
these
other
requisites
you've
mentioned,
your
honor,
go
to
status
and
we
don't
feel
that
that's
at
all
legitimate.
in
other
words,
reasonable
residence
requirement
would
go
to
whether
he
owns
a
car
or
whether
he's
bought
a
house.
certainly,
this
status
cries
in
the
face
of
our
system.
so,
time
is
the
most
fair.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
we
need
some
indicia
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
in
two
months,
your
honor,
there
is
time
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
the
two
months
is
not
giving
him
status
to
vote,
your
honor.
the
two
months
is
time
to
check
out
whether
he
is
a
legitimate
resident.
this
is
the
primary
purpose.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
this
is
administrative
--
this
is
an
administrative
reason
to
protect
the
period
of
election.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
on
a
full-scaled
basis,
your
honor,
our
legislature
--
this
indicia,
our
legislature
has
determined
that
it
takes
two
months
on
a
new
resident
to
legitimately
check
out
these
things.
these
things
take
time.
we're
talking
about
many
people
now.
we
have
people
employed
by
our
county
to
check
out
these
things
and
a
new
resident,
because
his
ties
to
the
community
are
newer,
it
is
reasonable
that
it
takes
longer
to
check
out
his
legitimate
residence.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
pardon
me?
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
they
--
i'm
not
conceding
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
i
won't
concede
that,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
i
will
concede
that
in
order
to
make
it
as
far
as
possible,
humanly
possible,
they
took
it
down
to
two
months.
i
will
not
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
colorado,
like
many
states
--
western
states,
is
noting
a
great
increase
in
population.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
well,
i
can't
second
guess
the
legislature,
your
honor,
whether
they
felt
they
were
wrong
or
not.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
well,
it
could
follow,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
we
certainly
do,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
this
is
second
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
this
is
secondary.
yes,
we
certainly
do.
as
a
western
state,
we
get
back
to
the
states
under
our
system,
electing
the
president.
this
is
the
way
it's
set
up.
and,
since
the
states
elect
the
president,
each
state
--
when
our
constitution
was
formulated,
the
framers
knew
that
each
state
had
certain
interests.
this
is
why
the
states
elect
the
president.
now,
in
colorado,
we
certainly
have
unique
interests,
our
western
spoke
proclamation,
our
water,
our
atomic
energy
experiments
that
are
going
on
out
there
that
have
caused
a
great
deal
of
concern,
our
poisonous
gas
storage
in
denver,
colorado
at
the
rocky
mountain
arsenal.
i
could
go
one
with
many
other
issues
and
i'm
sure
each
state
has
its
own
unique
issues
where
the
state
feels
that
there
should
be
some
identification.
we
don't
want
that
identification
to
be
burdensome
and
we
don't
feel
that
two
months
is
a
burdensome
identification.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
like
the
majority
--
great
majority
of
states,
colorado
has
a
one-year
residency
requirement
for
their
so-called
elections,
all
elections
other
than
presidential
and
vice-presidential.
therefore,
it
was
necessary,
in
order
to
separate
these
people,
because
colorado
did
recognize
the
problem,
it
was
necessary
to
enact
special
legislation
knocking
their
requirement
down
to
two
months
because,
and
this
is
just
for
--
these
people
only
vote
for
presidential
and
vice-presidential
electors
only
and
the
two
months,
as
opposed
to
one
year,
for
all
other
elections.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
we
would
namely
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
we
would
maintain
that
election,
when
it's
wholly
local,
of
course
the
local
interest
predominate
in
that
particular
election
and,
therefore,
it
requires
a
one-year
identification
with
these
particular
local
problems.
a
presidential
election
of
course,
being
the
embodiment
of
the
federal
system,
that
is,
the
national
issues
and
the
state
issues
and
the
nexus
between
the
two,
that
the
balance
goes
to
these
national
issues
enough
to
bring
it
down
to
two
months.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
colorado
--
if
a
person
manifests
his
desire
to
establish
residence
elsewhere,
of
course,
he
has
lost
his
colorado
residence.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
but
we
go
back
to
fundamental
common
law
test,
your
honor,
as
to
whether
one
has
lost
his
residence
or
not.
i
believe
that's
our
law.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
we've
often
thought
that,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
california
would
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
california,
very
much,
was
at
issue
in
this
case
also.
now,
if
i
may,
moving
on
to
my
example
of
the
manhattan
precinct,
we
feel
that
since
one
day
is
not
sufficient,
certainly,
two
months
--
can
we
say
that
two
months
is
an
unreasonable
period
of
time?
and,
we
must
maintain
is
two
months
is
certainly
reasonable
under
this
equal
protection
test.
now,
whether
it's
the
compelling
state
interest
test
or
the
traditional
test,
this
of
course
is
a
very
new
development
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
the
compelling
state
interest
test,
we
maintain,
does
not
apply
in
this
particular
incident
even
under
the
kramer
v.
union
free
school
district
case,
the
city
of
cipriano
versus
home,
quoted
by
mr.
hall,
and
williams
v.
roads
because
these
cases
placed
these
other
requirements
on
voting,
namely
property
and
so
on.
over
and
above
a
superstructure,
if
you
have,
over
and
above
the
fundamental
requirements
of
residency,
united
states
citizenship,
and
age,
these
three
fundamental
things
are
fundamental.
now,
these
other
cases
dealt
with
things
superimposed
over
and
above
different
requirements
there,
they
apply
the
compelling
state
interest
status.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
we
feel,
your
honor,
it's
the
rationally,
traditional,
reasonable
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
furtherance
of
legitimate
status.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
we
feel
it
is
not,
your
honor,
because
we
feel
that
we
do
have
compelling
interest.
that's
a
fortiori.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
we
know
that
mentions
in
his
brief
that
some
period
of
time
is
necessary.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
he
mentioned
the
three
days.
he
didn't
specifically
hang
his
head
at
three
days
reading
his
brief,
but
he
mentions
the
three
day
as
--
that
colorado
apparently
only
needs
three
days
which
is
incorrect.
we
have
20
days
for
everybody
at
the
minimum
because
the
three-day
person,
the
new
resident
must
have
a
20-day
registration.
your
honor,
moving
on
to
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
we
hold
that
there's
no
case
that
has
ever
held
that
the
right
to
vote
for
president
and
vice-president
is
a
federal
privilege
and
immunity.
there's
no
case
that
has
ever
held
that.
in
fact,
this
case
has
held
that
the
right
to
vote
for
president
and
vice-president
is
something
springing
out
of
state
citizenship.
now,
you
take
your
congressional
elections,
your
congress.
there,
under
article
1
section
4,
setting
up
the
congress
originally,
there
the
federal
government
was
given
certain
prerogatives
of
control.
it
was
a
dual
thing,
the
congressional,
but
the
president
and
vice-president
were
given
exclusively
to
the
states.
so,
they're
in
a
different
category
and
those
cases
like
ex
parte
yarbrough
and
so
on
that
are
quoted
by
appellant
apply
only
to
congressional
elections
and
do
not
apply
to
the
presidential
and
vice-presidential
elections.
and,
i
would
please
ask
that
you
please
consider
this
at
your
decision.
very
briefly,
to
conclude,
we
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
please
the
other
members
of
the
court.
to
synopsize
what
colorado's
position
is
in
this
matter,
we've
outlined
the
state
interest
that
we
feel
are
wholly
legitimate
and
reasonable
that
we
are
trying
to
further
in
our
two-month
residency
requirement
the
administrative
reasons,
the
feeling
that
it
takes
two
months
when
thousands
of
voters
a
day
in
el
paso
county
register
in
the
last
days
prior
to
the
election
with
a
new
resident,
since
his
ties
to
the
community
are
two,
it
takes
that
much
additional
time
to
check
his
legitimate
status
out.
then,
going
to
the
member
of
the
community
argument,
weighing
the
state
citizenship
in
the
one
hand,
the
federal
citizenship
on
the
other
hand,
the
dual
citizenship
of
a
new
resident
of
colorado,
we
feel
that
two
months
does,
to
some
small
degree,
identify
him
with
the
problems
of
colorado
so
that
when
he
casts
his
vote,
colorado
interest
have
some
bearing
in
his
decision
as
a
new
resident
of
that
state
since,
of
course,
the
president
under
the
constitution.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
the
two-month
act,
your
honor?
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
the
reasoning
behind
it,
to
further
the
state
interest
that
i
have
mentioned.
first,
we
have
the
one-year
general
residency
requirement
going
down
to
two
months
for
the
new
resident
for
president
and
vice-president.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
and
the
reasoning
is
to
bring
it
down
to
two
months
so
that,
since
his
federal
citizenship
has
such
a
predominant
interest
in
his
vote
as
well
as
some
balance
to
the
citizenship
aspect,
that
two
months
was
a
reasonable
requirement
to
fulfill
both
objectives,
fulfill
both
aspirations,
both
citizenships,
both
state
and
federal.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
oh
yes,
our
test
for
residency,
of
course,
we
utilize
the
traditional
common
law
test
for
residency,
that
is,
actual,
physical
presence
plus
the
intention
to
remain.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
that
was
passed,
your
honor,
back
in
1963,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
right,
following
a
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
we
are
computerizing
now.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
we
have
been
computerizing
that
interim
which
i
would
feel
would
be
one
of
the
reasons
the
legislature
amended
down.
we
are
not
computerized
in
many
counties
in
colorado.
el
paso
county
is
partially
computerized
and
become
more
so.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
once
again,
going
down,
first,
starting
with
the
one-year
to
come
down
to
six
months
to
give
those
new
residents
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
one
year
being
the
general
requirement
for
local
elections.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
the
six-month
statute
distinguished
between
those
voting
for
president.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
it
was
the
first
one,
your
honor,
yes,
following
a
recommendation
of
the
national
conference
of
commissioners
on
uniformed
state
laws.
in
other
words,
six
months
was
the
time
they
were
talking
about
in
the
early
‘60s,
and
whether
they've
come
off
of
that
or
not,
i
don't
know.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
the
reason
being
that
we
are
a
more
mobile
society
in
that
a
state,
in
protecting
its
interest,
make
every
possible
concession
to
lower
those
voting
requirements
down
so
that
more
people
could
vote
for
president
and
vice-president
and
not
be
disenfranchised.
in
other
words,
on
the
one
hand,
preserve
the
compelling
state
interest,
the
reasonable
requirements.
on
the
other
hand,
giving
that
voter
as
much
of
a
break
as
possible
at
new
residence
so
that
he
can
vote
if
he
fulfill
certain
minimum
residency
requirements.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
well,
this
is
the
problem,
your
honor.
the
states
have
this
responsibility
under
the
constitution
and
one
day
certainly
would
not
be
enough.
we
feel
that
two
months
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
pardon
me?
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
our
argument
is
that
it
takes
a
certain
amount
of
time
to
ensure
that
this
voter
votes
once
and
only
once
in
a
presidential
election.
he
votes
through
a
state.
and,
we've
determined
that
two
months
is
a
reasonable
time
to
make
these
checks
to
ensure
that
he
is,
in
fact,
a
resident
of
colorado
and
will
not
vote
elsewhere.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
oh
no,
your
honor,
but
that's
the
compelling
one
and
there
are
other
compelling
ones
also.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
we,
in
that
two-month
period,
can
check
back
to
the
state
of
his
former
residence
to
see
whether
to
inform
that
other
state
that
he
is
going
to
vote
in
colorado,
that
he
is
registered
to
vote
as
a
new
resident
and
that,
therefore,
it's
our
understanding
in
colorado
that
you,
california,
or
you,
new
york,
or
you,
illinois,
he's
not
going
to
vote
there,
and
this
is
done.
the
states
are
sending
out
letters
doing
this.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
20
days
counts
awfully
short,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
the
20-day
rule
is
the
general
registration
requirement,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
that's
the
general
registration
requirement.
the
new
resident,
of
course,
we
need
more
indicia
of
evidence
of
his
residence.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
that's
all.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
briefly
introduce
my
associates
who
have
worked
with
me
in
this
case,
mr.
carol
moltz,
deputy
district
attorney
of
alpasa
county,
colorado
and
the
district
attorney,
mr.
robert
russell.
gentlemen,
colorado
is
not
trying
to
disenfranchise
anyone.
colorado
is
merely
trying
to
protect
the
electoral
process
for
presidential
elections.
colorado,
in
furtherance
of
a
constitutionally
delegated
responsibility
under
article
2
section,
colorado,
in
furtherance
of
that
responsibility,
has
enacted
legislation,
of
course,
the
history
of
the
legislation
going
back
to
the
time
when
it
in
fact
became
a
state.
and,
this
legislation's
primary
purpose
is
to
protect
the
purity
of
the
election
process
in
keeping
with
the
constitution.
colorado
maintains
that
when
there
is
responsibility
delegated
under
the
constitution,
in
this
case
article
2
section
1,
that
there
must
be
the
corresponding
authority
to
carry
out
the
responsibility
and
do
it
in
an
equitable
way,
a
reasonable
way.
and,
we
maintain
that
this
is
what
colorado
has
done.
your
honors,
before
i
get
into
the
substance
of
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
clarify
the
colorado
election
law.
it
has
been
misstated.
the
colorado
election
law
at
issue,
colorado
revised
statutes
49-24-1,
with
reference
to
the
three-day
that
mr.
--
three
days
that
mr.
hall
makes
reference
to,
your
honors,
these
three
days
refers
to
the
time
when
a
new
resident
can
vote.
he
must
vote
three
days
precedent
to
the
regular
election
under
colorado
law
because
a
special
polling
place
has
been
setup
for
him
since
they
are
in
a
status
by
themselves,
since
our
general
requirement
is
one
year
for
our
local
elections.
we,
like
many
states,
have
enacted
a
special
legislation
for
presidential
and
vice-presidential
electors.
and,
under
that
special
provision
of
the
election,
the
new
resident
casts
his
vote,
applies
for
his
ballot
not
later
than
three
days
before
the
elections
for
president.
however,
as
the
law
reads,
such
new
resident
must
have
been
dully
registered
as
required
by
the
provisions
of
this
article.
this
throws
back
to
the
general
registration
provision,
namely
20
days,
so
a
new
resident
must
have
registered
to
vote
in
order
to
pick
up
his
ballot.
the
--
three-day
prior
to
election,
he
must
have
been
registered
20
days
prior
to
the
election
as
every
other
elector
in
the
state.
so,
we're
talking
about
20
days
where
the
registration
is
cut
off.
the
new
resident
must
comply
with
that
also.
so,
colorado
has
not
cut
themselves
down
to
three
days
in
view
of
their
two-month
residency
requirement
for
new
residents.
we
also
would
contend
that
mr.
hall
does
not
represent
even
a
class
in
colorado.
on
october
22,
1968,
after
filing
his
original
complaint
on
october
4,
1968,
mr.
hall
filed
a
motion
that
he
be
considered
a
member
of
the
class.
this
was
done
on
october
22,
1968.
the
district
court
never
ruled
as
to
whether
he
was
or
was
not
representative
of
a
class.
the
motion
was
never
ruled
upon.
therefore,
we
would
have
to
say,
under
the
law,
since
he
wasn't
affirmatively
declared
by
the
district
court
representative
of
a
class,
that
he
is
not
in
fact
representative
of
a
class
in
the
state
of
colorado.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
he
is
dully
registered
to
vote
now.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
and
becomes
a
resident
of
another
state.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
your
honor,
two
months.
he
would
then
once
again,
having
lost
his
residency,
have
to
pick
it
up
once
again
and
be
such
a
resident
for
two
months
prior
to
the
election.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
not
if
he
returned
within
30
days
and
established
a
new
residency
in
colorado
at
that
time.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
your
honor,
we
certainly
declare
that
this
case
--
maintain
that
this
case
is
moot
as
to
all
of
the
issues.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
he
can
litigate
it
as
he
did
at
the
district
court
level.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
your
honor,
i
would
feel
that
the
suit
should
have
been
filed
in
a
timely
manner
so
that
time
could've
been
allowed
for
review,
although
your
point
is
certainly
well
taken,
mr.
justice
marshall,
namely
that
it
would
be
very
difficult.
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
the
matter
to
be
heard
when
the
suit
is
filed
in
october
and
the
election
is
held
in
november.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
no,
sir.
now,
going
to
this
mootness
question,
we
rely
upon
the
authority
of
the
landmark
case
of
mills
v.
green.
that
case
holding
of
course
that
it
was
now
impossible
to
grant
any
effectual
relief
and
that
did
involve
an
election,
the
old
mills
v.
green
case
decided
in
1895
by
this
court.
and,
i'm
sure
the
court
is
well
aware
of
the
law
in
this
case
that
when
it's
impossible
to
give
an
effective
remedy
because
of
changed
conditions,
the
court
is
reluctant,
well,
in
this
case
says
“we'll
not
consider
--
we'll
not
proceed
to
a
formal
judgment
but
we'll
dismiss
the
appeal.”
your
honors,
in
view
of
the
six-month
amendment
down
to
two
months,
we
feel
this
is
really
the
telling
point
in
this
case.
colorado,
by
its
legislative
enactment
on
april
23
of
this
year,
amended
their
statute
down
to
two
months.
apparently,
the
legislature
of
colorado
themselves
thought
that
action
needed
to
be
taken
to
lower
that
requirement.
they
took
such
action,
signed
in
the
law.
we
now
have
a
two-month
requirement.
and,
under
the
precedence
of
this
court,
namely
the
carpenter
v.
wabash
railway
case,
309
us
23
at
1940
and
the
hines
v.
davidowitz
outlined
in
our
brief
at
312
us
52
1941
case,
this
court
held
that
when
a
subsequent
legislative
enactment
occurs
which
has
a
bearing
upon
a
case,
the
case,
when
it
goes
up
on
appeal,
must
be
considered
in
light
of
the
subsequent
legislative
enactment.
and,
therefore,
the
issue
before
this
court
now
is
really
moving
into
the
equal
protection
argument,
the
reasonableness
of
two
months.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
no,
your
honor.
six
months
was
the
basis
of
the
federal
court
decision
in
denver
in
october
of
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
they
held
the
six
months
reasonable,
your
honor,
yes.
we
go
back
to
the
constitution
itself.
we
don't
feel
that
any
part
of
the
constitution
should
be
downgraded,
as
the
term
was
used
here.
with
--
the
constitution
is
a
living
instrument
all
alive,
and
article
2
section
1,
of
course,
gives
the
states
the
power,
the
responsibility
to
establish
voter
qualifications,
both
in
federal
and
state
elections.
now,
with
this
constitutional
prerogative,
many
cases
of
course
have
interpreted
this
prerogative
and
have
not
downgraded
this
prerogative
one
iota.
this
is
a
viable
prerogative,
a
responsibility.
going
as
far
back
of
course
as
pope
v.
williams
and
miner
v.
happersett,
1875
case,
pope
v.
williams
1904,
and
then
working
forward
all
away
up
to
drueding
v.
devlin
where
drueding
took
this
same
case,
the
same
facts,
almost
identical.
the
issue
is
certainly
identical.
there,
a
one-year
residency
requirement
in
the
state
of
maryland
was
held
--
affirmed
per
curium
by
this
court
in
march
of
1965,
upholding
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
district
of
maryland.
and,
the
district
court
in
maryland
said
that
the
one-year
is
not
unreasonable.
now,
i'm
not
going
to
argue
for
one
year.
i'm
not
really
going
to
argue
for
six
months.
colorado
argues
for
the
present
law.
colorado
--
el
paso
county,
colorado
is
the
appellee
in
this
case
and
we
have
a
two-month
law
and
we
are
here
to
uphold
that
law.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
there
was
some
mention
made
to
that.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
i
recall
there
was
some
reference
to
that,
mr.
justice
marshall.
and
who
knows
what
the
motives
of
our
legislature
were?
i
certainly
do
not.
i
do
know
that
they
changed
this
law
and
colorado,
of
course,
is
not
unhappy
that
it
was
changed
to
two
months.
now,
going
from
this
fundamental
power
that
rests
with
the
states,
we
move
to
the
traditional
equal
protection
test.
is
there
a
rational
relationship?
what
state
interest
is
colorado
trying
to
protect
here?
very
briefly,
your
honors,
if
i
may
refer
to
our
brief.
the
interest
that
colorado
is
furthering
is,
one,
to
preserve
the
purity
of
the
elections
to
identify
the
voter
so
that
double
voting
could
be
prevented.
picture
the
situation
of
a
manhattan
precinct
and
newark,
new
jersey
across
the
hudson
and
greenwich,
connecticut
up
the
line
a
short
distance
away.
where,
if
there
were
no
state
residency
requirements
whatsoever,
there
would
be
no
check
upon
wholesale
moving
across
state
lines.
we
really
feel
this
is
a
legitimate
view.
and,
if
there
were
no
residency
requirements
whatsoever,
our
state
lines
would
be
a
mecca
for
voter
fraud.
we
really
feel
this.
now,
if
one
day
is
not
sufficient
to
ensure
some
check
on
a
boarder,
how
can
we
say
that
two
months
is
unreasonable?
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
but
the
criminal
penalty
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
afraid
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
he
would
be
punishable,
but
the
election
would
be
over
and,
no
doubt,
the
electoral
college
would've
met
on
december
5
of
the
particular
presidential
election
year
and
we
would
have
an
election
on
the
books.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
two
months
is
necessary,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
we
have
a
new
resident
coming
into
the
state.
as
a
new
resident,
he
of
course
has
a
residence.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
well,
we
feel
that
tying
all
these
other
requisites
you've
mentioned,
your
honor,
go
to
status
and
we
don't
feel
that
that's
at
all
legitimate.
in
other
words,
reasonable
residence
requirement
would
go
to
whether
he
owns
a
car
or
whether
he's
bought
a
house.
certainly,
this
status
cries
in
the
face
of
our
system.
so,
time
is
the
most
fair.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
we
need
some
indicia
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
in
two
months,
your
honor,
there
is
time
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
the
two
months
is
not
giving
him
status
to
vote,
your
honor.
the
two
months
is
time
to
check
out
whether
he
is
a
legitimate
resident.
this
is
the
primary
purpose.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
this
is
administrative
--
this
is
an
administrative
reason
to
protect
the
period
of
election.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
on
a
full-scaled
basis,
your
honor,
our
legislature
--
this
indicia,
our
legislature
has
determined
that
it
takes
two
months
on
a
new
resident
to
legitimately
check
out
these
things.
these
things
take
time.
we're
talking
about
many
people
now.
we
have
people
employed
by
our
county
to
check
out
these
things
and
a
new
resident,
because
his
ties
to
the
community
are
newer,
it
is
reasonable
that
it
takes
longer
to
check
out
his
legitimate
residence.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
pardon
me?
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
they
--
i'm
not
conceding
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
i
won't
concede
that,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
i
will
concede
that
in
order
to
make
it
as
far
as
possible,
humanly
possible,
they
took
it
down
to
two
months.
i
will
not
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
colorado,
like
many
states
--
western
states,
is
noting
a
great
increase
in
population.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
well,
i
can't
second
guess
the
legislature,
your
honor,
whether
they
felt
they
were
wrong
or
not.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
well,
it
could
follow,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
we
certainly
do,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
this
is
second
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
this
is
secondary.
yes,
we
certainly
do.
as
a
western
state,
we
get
back
to
the
states
under
our
system,
electing
the
president.
this
is
the
way
it's
set
up.
and,
since
the
states
elect
the
president,
each
state
--
when
our
constitution
was
formulated,
the
framers
knew
that
each
state
had
certain
interests.
this
is
why
the
states
elect
the
president.
now,
in
colorado,
we
certainly
have
unique
interests,
our
western
spoke
proclamation,
our
water,
our
atomic
energy
experiments
that
are
going
on
out
there
that
have
caused
a
great
deal
of
concern,
our
poisonous
gas
storage
in
denver,
colorado
at
the
rocky
mountain
arsenal.
i
could
go
one
with
many
other
issues
and
i'm
sure
each
state
has
its
own
unique
issues
where
the
state
feels
that
there
should
be
some
identification.
we
don't
want
that
identification
to
be
burdensome
and
we
don't
feel
that
two
months
is
a
burdensome
identification.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
like
the
majority
--
great
majority
of
states,
colorado
has
a
one-year
residency
requirement
for
their
so-called
elections,
all
elections
other
than
presidential
and
vice-presidential.
therefore,
it
was
necessary,
in
order
to
separate
these
people,
because
colorado
did
recognize
the
problem,
it
was
necessary
to
enact
special
legislation
knocking
their
requirement
down
to
two
months
because,
and
this
is
just
for
--
these
people
only
vote
for
presidential
and
vice-presidential
electors
only
and
the
two
months,
as
opposed
to
one
year,
for
all
other
elections.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
we
would
namely
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
we
would
maintain
that
election,
when
it's
wholly
local,
of
course
the
local
interest
predominate
in
that
particular
election
and,
therefore,
it
requires
a
one-year
identification
with
these
particular
local
problems.
a
presidential
election
of
course,
being
the
embodiment
of
the
federal
system,
that
is,
the
national
issues
and
the
state
issues
and
the
nexus
between
the
two,
that
the
balance
goes
to
these
national
issues
enough
to
bring
it
down
to
two
months.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
colorado
--
if
a
person
manifests
his
desire
to
establish
residence
elsewhere,
of
course,
he
has
lost
his
colorado
residence.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
but
we
go
back
to
fundamental
common
law
test,
your
honor,
as
to
whether
one
has
lost
his
residence
or
not.
i
believe
that's
our
law.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
we've
often
thought
that,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
california
would
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
california,
very
much,
was
at
issue
in
this
case
also.
now,
if
i
may,
moving
on
to
my
example
of
the
manhattan
precinct,
we
feel
that
since
one
day
is
not
sufficient,
certainly,
two
months
--
can
we
say
that
two
months
is
an
unreasonable
period
of
time?
and,
we
must
maintain
is
two
months
is
certainly
reasonable
under
this
equal
protection
test.
now,
whether
it's
the
compelling
state
interest
test
or
the
traditional
test,
this
of
course
is
a
very
new
development
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
the
compelling
state
interest
test,
we
maintain,
does
not
apply
in
this
particular
incident
even
under
the
kramer
v.
union
free
school
district
case,
the
city
of
cipriano
versus
home,
quoted
by
mr.
hall,
and
williams
v.
roads
because
these
cases
placed
these
other
requirements
on
voting,
namely
property
and
so
on.
over
and
above
a
superstructure,
if
you
have,
over
and
above
the
fundamental
requirements
of
residency,
united
states
citizenship,
and
age,
these
three
fundamental
things
are
fundamental.
now,
these
other
cases
dealt
with
things
superimposed
over
and
above
different
requirements
there,
they
apply
the
compelling
state
interest
status.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
we
feel,
your
honor,
it's
the
rationally,
traditional,
reasonable
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
furtherance
of
legitimate
status.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
we
feel
it
is
not,
your
honor,
because
we
feel
that
we
do
have
compelling
interest.
that's
a
fortiori.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
we
know
that
mentions
in
his
brief
that
some
period
of
time
is
necessary.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
he
mentioned
the
three
days.
he
didn't
specifically
hang
his
head
at
three
days
reading
his
brief,
but
he
mentions
the
three
day
as
--
that
colorado
apparently
only
needs
three
days
which
is
incorrect.
we
have
20
days
for
everybody
at
the
minimum
because
the
three-day
person,
the
new
resident
must
have
a
20-day
registration.
your
honor,
moving
on
to
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
we
hold
that
there's
no
case
that
has
ever
held
that
the
right
to
vote
for
president
and
vice-president
is
a
federal
privilege
and
immunity.
there's
no
case
that
has
ever
held
that.
in
fact,
this
case
has
held
that
the
right
to
vote
for
president
and
vice-president
is
something
springing
out
of
state
citizenship.
now,
you
take
your
congressional
elections,
your
congress.
there,
under
article
1
section
4,
setting
up
the
congress
originally,
there
the
federal
government
was
given
certain
prerogatives
of
control.
it
was
a
dual
thing,
the
congressional,
but
the
president
and
vice-president
were
given
exclusively
to
the
states.
so,
they're
in
a
different
category
and
those
cases
like
ex
parte
yarbrough
and
so
on
that
are
quoted
by
appellant
apply
only
to
congressional
elections
and
do
not
apply
to
the
presidential
and
vice-presidential
elections.
and,
i
would
please
ask
that
you
please
consider
this
at
your
decision.
very
briefly,
to
conclude,
we
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
please
the
other
members
of
the
court.
to
synopsize
what
colorado's
position
is
in
this
matter,
we've
outlined
the
state
interest
that
we
feel
are
wholly
legitimate
and
reasonable
that
we
are
trying
to
further
in
our
two-month
residency
requirement
the
administrative
reasons,
the
feeling
that
it
takes
two
months
when
thousands
of
voters
a
day
in
el
paso
county
register
in
the
last
days
prior
to
the
election
with
a
new
resident,
since
his
ties
to
the
community
are
two,
it
takes
that
much
additional
time
to
check
his
legitimate
status
out.
then,
going
to
the
member
of
the
community
argument,
weighing
the
state
citizenship
in
the
one
hand,
the
federal
citizenship
on
the
other
hand,
the
dual
citizenship
of
a
new
resident
of
colorado,
we
feel
that
two
months
does,
to
some
small
degree,
identify
him
with
the
problems
of
colorado
so
that
when
he
casts
his
vote,
colorado
interest
have
some
bearing
in
his
decision
as
a
new
resident
of
that
state
since,
of
course,
the
president
under
the
constitution.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
the
two-month
act,
your
honor?
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
the
reasoning
behind
it,
to
further
the
state
interest
that
i
have
mentioned.
first,
we
have
the
one-year
general
residency
requirement
going
down
to
two
months
for
the
new
resident
for
president
and
vice-president.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
and
the
reasoning
is
to
bring
it
down
to
two
months
so
that,
since
his
federal
citizenship
has
such
a
predominant
interest
in
his
vote
as
well
as
some
balance
to
the
citizenship
aspect,
that
two
months
was
a
reasonable
requirement
to
fulfill
both
objectives,
fulfill
both
aspirations,
both
citizenships,
both
state
and
federal.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
oh
yes,
our
test
for
residency,
of
course,
we
utilize
the
traditional
common
law
test
for
residency,
that
is,
actual,
physical
presence
plus
the
intention
to
remain.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
that
was
passed,
your
honor,
back
in
1963,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
right,
following
a
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
we
are
computerizing
now.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
we
have
been
computerizing
that
interim
which
i
would
feel
would
be
one
of
the
reasons
the
legislature
amended
down.
we
are
not
computerized
in
many
counties
in
colorado.
el
paso
county
is
partially
computerized
and
become
more
so.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
once
again,
going
down,
first,
starting
with
the
one-year
to
come
down
to
six
months
to
give
those
new
residents
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
one
year
being
the
general
requirement
for
local
elections.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
the
six-month
statute
distinguished
between
those
voting
for
president.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
it
was
the
first
one,
your
honor,
yes,
following
a
recommendation
of
the
national
conference
of
commissioners
on
uniformed
state
laws.
in
other
words,
six
months
was
the
time
they
were
talking
about
in
the
early
‘60s,
and
whether
they've
come
off
of
that
or
not,
i
don't
know.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
the
reason
being
that
we
are
a
more
mobile
society
in
that
a
state,
in
protecting
its
interest,
make
every
possible
concession
to
lower
those
voting
requirements
down
so
that
more
people
could
vote
for
president
and
vice-president
and
not
be
disenfranchised.
in
other
words,
on
the
one
hand,
preserve
the
compelling
state
interest,
the
reasonable
requirements.
on
the
other
hand,
giving
that
voter
as
much
of
a
break
as
possible
at
new
residence
so
that
he
can
vote
if
he
fulfill
certain
minimum
residency
requirements.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
well,
this
is
the
problem,
your
honor.
the
states
have
this
responsibility
under
the
constitution
and
one
day
certainly
would
not
be
enough.
we
feel
that
two
months
--
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
pardon
me?
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
our
argument
is
that
it
takes
a
certain
amount
of
time
to
ensure
that
this
voter
votes
once
and
only
once
in
a
presidential
election.
he
votes
through
a
state.
and,
we've
determined
that
two
months
is
a
reasonable
time
to
make
these
checks
to
ensure
that
he
is,
in
fact,
a
resident
of
colorado
and
will
not
vote
elsewhere.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
oh
no,
your
honor,
but
that's
the
compelling
one
and
there
are
other
compelling
ones
also.
mr.
bernard
r.
baker
we,
in
that
two-month
period,
can
check
back
to
the
state
of
his
former
residence
to
see
whether
to
inform
that
other
state
that
he
is
going
to
vote
in
colorado,
that
he
is
registered
to
vote
as
a
new
resident
and
that,
therefore,
it's
our
understanding
in
colorado
that
you,
california,
or
you,
new
york,
or
you,
illinois,
he's
not
going
to
vote
there,
and
this
is
done.
the
states
are
sending
out
letters
