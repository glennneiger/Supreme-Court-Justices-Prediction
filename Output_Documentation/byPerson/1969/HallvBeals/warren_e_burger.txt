down

mr.

is
one
of
the
purposes
of
the

well,
if
you

colorado
by
arriving
there
on
friday
to
regis
--
in
time
to
register
with
no
other

this
would
mean
that
you
can
vote
by
absentee
ballot
in
new

and
move
to
colorado
or
--
chief

warren
e.

and
vote

again.
isn't
that
possible?
chief

i
suppose
anytime
anybody
ever
votes
twice
he's
violating
some
rule,
wouldn't
that
be
true?
chief

warren
e.
burger
well,

as
a
whole
under

as
it

stands?
chief

yes,
but
that

that's
what
the
great

about.
chief

warren
e.

well,
the
popular
view

chief

warren
e.

may
be
one
thing,
but
the
fact
is
another.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
there
any
reliable
records
anywhere
on
how
many
people
who

of
residence,
reliable
statistics?
chief

warren
e.
burger
well,
those
are
people
who
moved,
not
--
that
doesn't
go
to
the
--
that's
an
objective
factor.
that
doesn't
go
to
the
subject
or
factor
of
how
many
of
them
applied
before
and
were
denied
permission
to
vote.
chief

so,
when
we're
talking
about
millions
of
people

disenfranchised,
we
don't
know
whether
they
were
disenfranchised
or
whether
they
just
didn't
care
one
way
or
the
other.
