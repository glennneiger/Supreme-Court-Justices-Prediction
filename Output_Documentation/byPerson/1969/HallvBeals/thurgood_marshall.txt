mr.
hall,
where
is
it
that
you
said
people
in
colorado?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
say
your
class
is
limited
to
people
in
colorado?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
wouldn't
your
class
rather
be
people
who,
at
the
present
time,
are
in
colorado
but
who
weren't
there
when
you
brought
the
case,
because
all
those
who
were
there
when
you
brought
the
case
are
now
franchised?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
got
a
little
technical
problem.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
would
be
your
status
if
you
leave
colorado
next
week
and
then
come
back
two
years
from
now?
you
wouldn't
be
allowed
to
vote
as
it
now
stands,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
doesn't
that
give
you
status?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
just
worried
about
you
giving
up
so
quick.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
mr.
hall
leaves
colorado
tomorrow
and
returns
30
days
before
election
day
in
1972.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
couldn't
vote?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
leaves
tomorrow.
justice
thurgood
marshall
becomes
a
resident
of
another
state.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
returns
to
colorado,
well,
would
that
be
59
days
before.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
would
not
be
able
to
vote.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
this
case
is
moot.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
you
think
for
a
moment
and
tell
me
how
a
person
in
mr.
hall's
situation
could
ever
litigate
this
matter?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
he
loses
there,
is
there
any
way
under
the
sun
for
him
to
get
here
before
election?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
wouldn't
go
as
far
as
impossible,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
the
maryland
say
in
the
last
paragraph
that
we've
been
assured
by
the
attorney
general
that
the
general
assembly
of
maryland
is
going
to
change
the
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
didn't
he
also
say
that
the
plaintiff
did
a
wonderful
job
in
getting
it
changed,
assuming
that
they
would
change
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
that
voter
who
went
from
new
york
to
new
jersey
be
subject
to
the
same
criminal
penalties
of
the
voter
that
went
from
wart
6
to
wart
8
in
new
york?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
do
you
--
you're
sure
that
that
happens?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
illegal
voting
in
every
state,
i
assume.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
assume
that
they
are
punishable
and
this
person
would
be
punishable
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
goes
where
they
have
great
congressional
investigations
as
to
vote
frauds
in
certain
states.
it
doesn't
affect
the
election.
now,
why
is
two
months
necessary?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
resident
here
bought
a
home,
registered
his
car,
and
paid
taxes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
else
would
you
need
to
find
out
about
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
makes
him
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
makes
him
such
a
good
citizen
in
two
months?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
else
could
he
do
in
two
months,
other
than
to
buy
a
home,
register
his
car,
pay
his
taxes,
and
do
everything
that
any
other
resident
does?
what
else
could
he
do
under
the
two-month
period?
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn't
you
check
these
facts
in
two
minutes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
long
would
it
take
you
to
find
out
that
he
owned
a
home,
owned
a
car
and
registered
the
car,
and
paid
his
taxes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
changed
it
from
six
to
two.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
changed
it
from
six
months
to
two
months.
justice
thurgood
marshall
because,
obviously,
they
thought
six
months
was
wrong.
they'd
made
a
mistake
about
six
months.
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn't
i
assume
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
could
assume
that,
couldn't
i?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
the
fact
that
the
difference
between
the
six-month
period
and
the
two,
you
had
an
increase
in
population,
haven't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
there's
a
good
possibility
we're
wrong
about
the
six
months.
i
say
that
because
my
second
question
is
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
speaking
for
myself,
if
i
assumed
that
maybe
they
were
wrong
about
the
six
months,
a
few
years
from
now
they
might
find
they
were
wrong
about
the
two.
would
that
follow?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
you
be
sure
he
won't
vote
some
place
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can't
you
do
that
in
20
days?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
must
be
some
reasoning
toward
the
20-day
rule.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
the
only
reason
to
that.
justice
thurgood
