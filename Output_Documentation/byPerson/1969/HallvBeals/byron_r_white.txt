you
can
be
representative
of
the
class
and
not
be
a
member
of
it,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
other
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
asking
us
to
lay
down,
to
decide
a
basic
constitution
that
anything
should
--
as
long
as
two
months
is
invalid,
which
has
some
impact
beyond
colorado.
colorado
may
think
it
only
needs
three
days
and
somebody
else
may
think
they
need
two
months.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
admit
--
you
admit
the
need
for
some
way
to
get
through
to
you.
i
think
i
read
your
brief
that
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
anybody
could
--
justice
byron
r.
white
any
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can't
in
california?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
same
--
you'd
have
the
same
--
what's
the
rule
in
california,
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that's
unreasonable?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
that
--
you're
suggesting
then
that
we
might
hold
this
waiting
period
unconstitutional
in
colorado,
but
wholly
constitutional
in
california
and
new
york.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
two
months
restriction
doesn't?
you'd
say
some
kind
of
restriction
would
be
--
would
serve
a
compelling
state
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
they
can
have
a
three-day
period?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
serves
a
compelling
state
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
would
you
--
if
they
only
had
a
three-day
waiting
period,
would
you
attack
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
serve
a
compelling
state
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
would
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
have
a
different
view
if
this
was
for
a
state
office,
this
election
was
for
state
office?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
what
compelling
state
interest
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
suffice
a
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
think
that's
relevant
in
voting
for
electors?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
electors
should
really
understand
the
problems
of
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
voters
ought
to
know
the
difference
between
presidential
candidates
in
terms
of,
say,
their
views
on
reclamation
or
water
or
natural
resources?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
whether
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
whether
a
president
carries
a
state,
the
western
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be
someone
at
your
class.
the
class
that
you
are
representing
at
the
time
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
class
is
constantly
changing
every
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
all
the
people
you
represent
when
the
case
started
have
to
qualify
to
vote,
but
there
are
some
new
ones.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
held
the
six
months
reasonable.
justice
byron

white
does
colorado
have
a
residence
res
--
retention
law
in
the
event
--
assume
a
colorado
resident
moves
out
to
kansas,
does
colorado
permit
him
to
retain

residence
for
voting
purposes
for
any
period
of
time?
some
states
do,
don't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
don't
let
him
--
justice
byron

i
suppose
you
might
argue
that
the
proper
defendant
in
a
case
like
this
should've
been
california.
justice
byron

white
i
take
it
--
justice
byron

white
that
would've
accommodated
everybody's

so
you're
--

your
test
isn't
critical

i
know

the
--

justice

the
question

isn't
critical.
