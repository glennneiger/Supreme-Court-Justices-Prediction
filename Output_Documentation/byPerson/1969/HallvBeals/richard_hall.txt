mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
hall
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
richard
hall,
appellant
pro
se
in
this
case.
i
appear
this
morning
to
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
colorado,
which
decision
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
a
colorado
law
which
requires
that
a
voter
be
a
resident
of
the
state
of
colorado
for
six
months
before
being
allowed
to
vote
for
president
and
vice-president.
i
must
state
to
the
court
that
the
law
has
since
been
amended
by
the
colorado
legislature
and
it
now
requires
a
two-month
residence.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir.
the
facts
in
this
case--
mr.
richard
hall
i
wouldn't
have
been
able
to.
mr.
richard
hall
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir,
but
at
the
time,
i
was
disenfranchised
and
i
am
now
the
representative
of
a
class
of
all
voters
who
were
disenfranchised
by
similar
qualms.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
i
was
a
member
of
the
class
at
the
time
the
--
of
my
case,
your
honor,
and
i
was
disenfranchised
and
was
prevented
from
voting.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
the
residence
requirements
vary
per
state.
mr.
richard
hall
it
was
six
months
and
i
was
disenfranchised.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
the
problem
is
similar
in
all
the
states.
mr.
richard
hall
it
isn't
my
problem.
mr.
richard
hall
no,
sir.
my
class
was
the
class
in
colorado.
mr.
richard
hall
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
hall
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
hall
i
would've
represented
everyone
from
six
months
on
down
which
would've
included
people
who'd
been
there
two
months.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
it's
my
contention,
your
honor,
that
no
period
longer
than
the
registration
period
should
be
required
by
the
state.
colorado
allows
people
to
appear
and
register
up
until
the
friday
before
the
election.
they
evidently
feel
that
that's
the
amount
of
time
they
need
to
process
registration
applications.
mr.
richard
hall
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
hall
well,
i
think,
as
a
technical
matter
of
the
drafting
of
my
complaint,
that's
the
class
i
attempted
to
represent,
but
i
--
mr.
richard
hall
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and,
of
course,
the
question
won't
come
up
again.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir.
the
question
won't
come
up
again
until
1972,
maybe
people
who
are
in
colorado
now
who
will
not
be
there
then
and
maybe
people
who
will
move
into
colorado
--
mr.
richard
hall
if
i
acquired
a
residence
in
another
state
and
then
move
back
into
colorado
less
than
two
months
before
the
national
election,
no,
i
would
not
be
allowed
to
vote.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
i
would
feel
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
your
honor,
i
think,
first,
i
do
face
the
problem
i've
pointed
out
in
the
amicus
briefs
that
i
may
move
again
in
the
future.
i,
in
an
analogous
situation
of
the
taxpayer,
glass
versus
collin,
i
have
an
interest
in
other
people
being
allowed
to
vote.
their
ability
to
register
and
become
a
qualified
elector
affects
their
right
to
join
a
political
party
and
other
items,
and
i
do
believe
that
the
class
that
i
represent
is,
first,
nationwide
and,
secondly,
that
it
affects
people
who
will
be
affected.
we
don't
know
who
they
are,
but
we
know,
as
a
statistical
matter,
that
they
will
certainly
exist
in
1972.
and,
i
think
the
question
every
one
of
those
voters
will
face
will
be
the
same.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that
is
one
of
the
purposes.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
if
you
would
tip
to
that
--
mr.
richard
hall
well,
if
one
attempted
that,
he
would
be
in
violation
of
the
law
because
when
you
apply
in
colorado,
you
--
mr.
richard
hall
well,
yes,
sir.
the
question
is
whether
the
waiting
period
serves
that
purpose.
colorado
has
determined
that
you
don't
have
to
apply
for
the
ballot
until
the
friday
before
the
election.
so,
they
don't,
evidently,
feel
that
they
need
the
six
month
or
the
two
months
in
which
to
process
the
application,
perform
any
checks,
nor
does
colorado
attempt
to
contact
the
old
state
from
which
one
moved.
they
make
no
attempt
to
contact
california,
in
my
case.
so,
i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
that
they
used
the
waiting
period
for
the
purpose
you
ascribe
to
it.
mr.
richard
hall
some
states,
your
honor,
do
have
the
new
resident
fill
out
what
amounts
to
a
postcard
--
mr.
richard
hall
well,
the
question
is
whether
the
waiting
period
serves
any
state
purpose.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
your
honor
i
think
--
mr.
richard
hall
i
think
the
question
of
the
purity
of
election
is
a
legitimate
state
concern.
the
question
is
how
long
a
period
the
state
needs
to
serve
that
concern.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
i
think
the
question
is
similar
for
all
the
states,
yes,
sir.
and,
in
particular,
colorado,
first,
does
not
make
the
attempt
to
contact
the
old
state
and
they
feel
that
three
days
is
sufficient
time
for
their
purposes.
and,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
that,
therefore,
might
be
an
appropriate
period.
mr.
richard
hall
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
hall
it's
54
days,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
the
state
of
new
york
has
an
amicus
for
the
state
of
colorado
said
that
they
have
more
people,
maybe
that
a
state
could
show
that
they
have
added
problems
because
of
an
increase
population
and
--
mr.
richard
hall
well,
i
think
the
particular
states
would
have
to
show
a
legitimate
state
interest
to
support
their
particular
requirement.
new
york
claims
in
its
brief
that
they
had
added
problems
that
colorado
evidently
appeals
it
did
not
have.
so,
we
would
contend,
your
honor
--
yes,
sir?
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
hall
well
--
mr.
richard
hall
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
hall
well,
your
honor,
i
think
--
mr.
richard
hall
article
2
section
1
provides
that
the
state
can't
chose
the
man
in
which
presidential
electors
are
appointed,
but
once
they
decide
that
it's
to
be
done
by
popular
election.
i
would
suggest
that
harper
versus
virginia
board
of
elections
case,
for
example,
says
once
the
franchise
is
granted
to
the
electorate,
you
can't
have
classifications
that
invidiously
discriminate.
and,
i
think
this
case
affects
both
the
right
to
vote
and
the
right
to
travel,
both
of
which
have
been
held
by
this
court
very
recently
to
be
among
the
most
fundamental
and
precious
rights
we
have.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
i
believe
those
statements
come
from
cases
decided
in
an
earlier
day,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
recent
case
--
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir,
but
i
believe
the
recent
cases
such
as
kramer,
williams
versus
roads,
and
others
suggest
that
the
right
to
vote
is
a
fundamental
right
that
the
court
protects
with
the
most
rigid
scrutiny
and
that
applies
a
compelling
interest
test.
and,
the
question
is
whether
the
waiting
period
portion
of
the
residence
requirement
serves
a
compelling
state
interest.
my
question
is
what
interest
it
serves
at
all.
i
don't
believe
it
serves,
as
applied
in
the
state
of
colorado,
any
administrative
purposes.
furthermore,
the
traditional
justifications
that
one
should
be
a
member
of
the
community
in
which
he
seeks
to
vote
and
that
he'd
be
familiar
with
the
candidates
and
issues,
i
don't
believe
apply
in
the
particular
context
of
a
presidential
election
because
the
would-be
voter
is
a
member
of
the
community,
which
i
would
contend
is
a
national
one.
the
president
and
vice-president
are
the
only
people
elected
by
the
nation
as
a
whole
that
govern
the
nation
as
a
whole.
and,
i
believe
that
a
--
mr.
richard
hall
well,
they
are
elected
at
the
present
time
under
the
electoral
college
system.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
the
popular
view
is
that
they're
elected
by
the
people
that
it's
expression
of
the
national
--
mr.
richard
hall
will.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
that
may
be,
your
honor,
but
in
the
williams
versus
roads
case,
for
example,
the
state
attempted
to
rely
on
article
2
section
1
and
this
court
said
that
article
2
section
1
does
not
allow
a
state
to
set
up
requirements
that
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
so,
the
question
then
turns
whether
it
does
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
it's
my
contention,
under
the
compelling
interest
test
which
has
been
developed
by
this
court
in
right
to
vote
cases,
that
it
does
not
serve
any
state
purpose.
the
state
of
colorado
--
mr.
richard
hall
the
state
of
colorado,
your
honor,
has
said
you
could
register
up
until
friday
before
the
election.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir.
i
think
if
they
feel
--
mr.
richard
hall
they
apparently
feel
that
it
does,
your
honor.
i
think
that
would
be
sufficient
short.
i
would
be
in
favor
of
having
as
many
people
vote
as
possible,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
hall
i
doubt
it,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
hall
arguably,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
believe
i
would.
and,
i
think
that
there
are
no
special
voting
lists
to
be
made
up
or
holding
places
to
be
established.
in
the
state
of
colorado,
you
go
to
vote
at
the
county
clerk's
office
--
mr.
richard
hall
on
a
special
machine.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir,
i
would.
mr.
richard
hall
i
think
there
is
the
--
mr.
richard
hall
question
of
ensuring
that
the
voter
is
familiar
with
the
state
candidates
and
the
state
issues
so
that
he
can
vote
intelligently.
mr.
richard
hall
no,
sir.
i
think
the
--
mr.
richard
hall
the
electors,
perhaps,
your
honor,
but
the
people
who
vote
for
the
electors
vote
on
the
basis
of
national
issues
for
national
candidates.
the
information
they
learned
about
the
candidates
comes
from
national
sources.
i
feel
that
i
was
--
mr.
richard
hall
i
feel
the
dominant
issues
in,
for
example,
last
year's
campaign,
your
honor,
were
national
in
scope.
i
think
the
critical
issues
with
the
war
and
civil
rights,
and
inflation
and
crime,
i
think
those
are
national
problems.
i
don't
believe
that
the
effect
of
state
issues
placed
at
large
apart
in
--
mr.
richard
hall
a
selection
of
a
pres
--
mr.
richard
hall
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
the
majority
of
the
voters
vote
on
national
issues.
they
may
have
a
different
feel
about
some
of
those
national
issues,
but
i
think
that
they
are
paramount
issues
or
national
in
scope.
so,
i
think
a
voter
is
able
to
case
an
intelligent
ballot
and
i
think
that
meets
the
interest
of
the
state
in
that
particular
question,
and
that's
why
it's
different
than
a
state
or
local
election.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
as
i
say,
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
hall
first,
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
hall
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
problems
you
mention
are
local
instances
of
other
national
problems.
the
question
of
conservation
and
water
usage
is
a
national
one.
i
think
the
question
of
gun-control,
for
example,
might
be
looked
at
one
way
in
the
western
states
as
opposed
to
the
eastern
states
but,
nevertheless,
it
is
a
national
problem.
the
people
in
the
eastern
states
are
aware
of
the
problem.
mr.
richard
hall
and
furthermore,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
if
that
is
the
justification
the
state
wishes
to
comply,
as
expressed
in
carrington
versus
rash,
i
don't
believe
a
state
has
the
right
to
prevent
people
from
voting
because
of
a
concern
as
to
which
way
they
would
vote.
mr.
richard
hall
i
don't
claim
it's
of
absolutely
no
relevance,
your
honor,
but
i
do
think
that
the
dominant
influence
on
a
voter
in
the
presidential
election
are
national
issues.
local
issues
may
have
an
effect,
but
i
don't
believe
they
have
controlling
facts.
i
don't
believe
they
had
a
sufficient
effect
to
meet
a
compelling
state
interest.
i
contend,
your
honor,
that
the
question
is
whether
the
resident's
waiting
period
serves
a
legitimate
interest,
in
that,
it
affects
both
the
right
to
vote
and
the
right
to
travel
and
that
both
these
rights
are
protected
by
the
compelling
interest
test.
i
would
contend
that
the
residence
requirement,
in
particular
as
applied
by
the
state
of
colorado,
serves
none
of
these
purposes,
that
it,
therefore,
sets
up
a
discrimination
between
voters
that
is
not
supported
by
any
reason
and,
therefore,
would
be
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
this
is
a
problem
of,
i
would
contend,
some
national
significance.
figures
have
shown
recently
that
disenfranchised
voters
number
into
the
millions,
and
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
two
of
our
last
three
elections
have
been
very,
very
close.
and,
i
would
contend,
first,
as
just
the
magnitude
of
the
civil
liberties
problem
involved
that
five
million
voters
are
disenfranchised
and,
i
would
contend,
for
no
legitimate
reason,
that
this
is
a
problem
that
merits
correction.
the
district
court
in
colorado
itself
recognized
that
the
situation
was,
in
their
words,
unfair
and
unjust.
and,
i
would
hope
that
the
problem
could
be
corrected.
i
feel
that
the
requirement
is
unconstitutional,
both
the
original
six-month
requirement
and
as
amended
down
to
two
months.
i
don't
believe
the
state
of
colorado
can
show
that
it
needs
the
two
months
for
any
purpose.
they
do
not
attempt
to
use
the
two
months
for
any
purpose.
they
do
not
attempt
to
notify
the
old
state
and
take
the
voter
off
the
roles
to
prevent
double
voting.
it
may
be
that
that
would
be
a
good
idea,
but
they
don't
attempt
to
do
it.
so,
i
don't
believe
they
could
claim
at
this
time
that
that's
one
of
the
justifications
for
the
law.
i
don't
believe
that
the
case
of
drueding
versus
devlin,
which
was
affirmed
by
this
court
in
pre
curium
four
years
ago
on
similar
situation,
necessitates
an
affirmance
in
this
case.
i
believe
the
law,
since
drueding,
has
been
modified.
the
compelling
interest
test
has
come
into
play
by
this
court.
the
right
to
travel
in
the
shapiro
versus
thompson
case
involving
welfare
residents
requirements
as
--
mr.
richard
hall
well,
first,
your
honor,
the
right
to
travel
theory
that
came
up
in
the
shapiro
versus
thompson
was
not
before
the
drueding
court.
so,
there
is
a
different
theory
involved.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir,
i
believe
that's
correct,
but
i
believe
that
a
different
theory
is
present
here.
a
different
standard
of
evaluation
has
come
into
effect
since
then.
i
believe
that
article
2
section
1
has
been
downgraded
somewhat
since
then.
so,
i
don't
believe
there
are
any
obstacles
to
it.
furthermore,
i
believe
the
district
court
in
drueding
failed
to
analyze
the
national
community
doctrine
and,
of
course,
the
case
wasn't
argued
here.
it
wasn't
submitted
on
briefs.
so,
the
court
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
consider
it
as
fully
as
they
have
here.
so,
i
don't
believe
that
it
constitutes
a
scope
of
an
obstacle
that
some
cases
might
--
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir,
nor
do
i
believe,
your
honors,
that
the
question
is
moot.
first,
the
fact
that
the
election
is
over,
i
don't
believe
makes
the
case
moot
because
another
presidential
election
will
appear
in
1972.
as
a
matter
of
statistical
certainty,
we
know
under
the
present
framework
of
the
laws
that
millions
of
voters
will
be
disenfranchised.
this
is
what
the
statistics
show
us.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
i
have
referred
in
brief,
your
honor,
to
statistics
introduced
by
senator
kennedy
in
support
of
a
bill
he
introduced
in
congress,
which
he
had
prepared
by
the
bureau
of
the
census,
and
those
figures
are
set
forth
in
a
particular
page
in
the
congressional
order.
mr.
richard
hall
no,
sir.
i
don't
believe
there
are
any
figures
that
show
how
many
people
actually
applied.
it
may
be
that
they
made
private
inquiry
and
found
out
that
the
rule
was
and
simply
didn't
bother
to
apply,
but
the
rule
was
there.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
we
don't
know
that,
your
honor,
but,
as
i
say,
they
may
have
made
private
inquiry
or
articles
come
out
in
the
paper
before
election
about
what
the
registration
requirements
are
and
they
could
just,
in
the
privacy
of
their
living
room,
read
that
they
are
not
eligible
and
not
make
the
effort
to
go
down
and
apply.
so,
i
don't
believe
that
we
could
hold
that
against
the
question.
there
are
reliable
statistics
that
a
substantial
number
anywhere
from
two
million
which
was
senator
kennedy's
figures,
five
million
which
was
the
result
of
a
statistical
survey
by
the
ballot
poll,
eight
million
which
was
the
result
of
a
presidential
commission
which
studied
the
problem.
so,
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
the
figure
is
in
the
millions
of
people
who
could've
been
disenfranchised.
and,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
how
many
people
actually
made
application.
so,
i
would
suggest
that
the
question
is
not
moot
because
the
1968
election
is
over
because
we're
going
to
have
another
presidential
election
in
four
years.
mr.
richard
hall
no,
sir,
nor
do
i
feel
that
the
amendment
of
the
law
down
to
two
months
makes
the
case
moot,
first,
because
i
feel
that
the
two-month
requirement
still
has
the
question
of
being
unreasonable
and,
secondly,
there
are
20
states
in
the
union
that
still
have
a
requirement
of
six
months
or
longer.
so,
as
a
national
problem,
and
i
would
contend
that
it
is
a
national
problem,
the
issues
involved
are
the
same
for
all
the
states
that
six
months,
as
a
standard,
is
still
the
precedent
of
the
united
states.
it's
still
affecting
voters.
and,
if
i
have
--
if
i
represent
the
class
of
voters
throughout
the
united
states,
which
i
would
certainly
suggest,
then
the
question
of
six
months
is
still
before
the
court.
so,
i
don't
believe
the
question
is
moot.
i
do
feel
that
the
law,
since
drueding,
undercuts
the
theory
of
that
case.
the
right
to
vote
and
the
right
to
travel
have
both
been
protected
by
very
strict
scrutiny
and
compelling
interest
test,
and
i
would
ask
that
this
court
set
the
matter
or
declare
the
colorado
requirement
unconstitutional
on
that
basis.
mr.
richard
hall
the
lowest?
mr.
richard
hall
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
no
requirement
at
all,
your
honor.
as
i
understand
the
wisconsin
law,
you
could
come
in
the
day
of
election
and
sign
up.
nebraska
and
--
nebraska
has
two
days.
alaska
and
ohio
have
four
days.
north
dakota
has
10
days.
mr.
richard
hall
no,
sir,
just
for
the
presidential
election.
many
states
have
made
special
provision
for
just
the
presidential
election
because
they
realize
that
the
issues
involved
are
different.
mr.
richard
hall
as
has
colorado,
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir,
i
am
finished.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
richard
hall
that
question
wasn't
decided
by
the
district
court
because
they
decided
against
me
personally.
i
would
contend
that
the
class
is
everyone
who
was
disenfranchised
by
a
similar
state
or
precinct
and
county.
i
think
the
issues
are
the
same.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir,
that
would
be
my
contention.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
at
the
time,
i
was
representing
people
trying
to
vote
in
1968,
but
i
would
contend
that
i
--
the
question
is
the
same
and
will
come
up
--
mr.
richard
hall
but
it
constantly
exists.
we
know
that
it
will
exist
in
1972.
mr.
richard
hall
we
know
that
there
will
be
new
ones,
your
honor.
that's
just
what
statistics
tell
us.
they
will
move
and,
in
1972,
they
will
be
disenfranchised.
mr.
richard
hall
prospectively,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
hall
and
also,
i
would
point
out
--
mr.
richard
hall
everyo
--
prospectively,
you
could
say
that.
yes,
sir.
also,
as
the
amicus
brief
of
mr.
harvey
burg
points
out,
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts
is
presently
withholding
a
decision
in
a
case
compiled
there,
pending
the
determination
of
this
case.
so,
we
have
at
least
one
district
court
of
the
united
states
that's
specifically
waiting
to
see
how
this
case
comes
out
because
they
feel
it
will
affect
their
decision.
so,
the
question
is
still
with
us,
your
honors,
and
i
don't
believe
it's
moot.
i
would
ask
that
the
court
decide
it
and
that
the
unfairness
and
injustice,
as
the
district
court
puts
it,
of
disenfranchising
that
many
voters
for
the
most
important
election
in
the
country
be
removed.
if
the
court
please,
i
shall
close
at
this
time
in
grants
of
a
few
closing
remarks
after
mr.
baker
is
finished.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir.
very
briefly,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry
if
i
misstated
the
colorado
law.
i
quoted
what
i
thought
was
the
controlling
statute
that's
contained
on
page
31
of
my
brief,
and
i
did
understand
that
they
could
apply
up
to
three
days
before
the
election.
on
the
question
of
mootness,
mr.
baker
relies
on
mills
versus
green
which
was
decided
in
1895.
i
would
rely
on
moore
versus
ogilvie
which
was
decided
six
months
ago,
which
held
that
a
continuing
problem
such
as
this
and
that
case
involved
illinois
election
law,
was
not
moot.
i
think
the
fact
the
district
court
upheld
the
reasonableness
of
six
months
is
not
controlling
because
they
did
so
under
the
traditional
test
and
did
apply
the
compelling
interest
test
that
now
applies
to
the
right
to
vote.
any
reliance
on
the
case
of
pope
versus
williams
is
misplaced
because
that
particularly
left
opened
the
question
of
presidential
electors.
this
question
of
voting
in
more
than
one
state,
we
do
not
argue
against
the
requirement
that
you
be
a
resident
of
the
state
in
which
you
vote.
and,
as
in
carrington
versus
rash,
the
state
can
impose
reasonable
requirements
to
see
that
you're
a
resident,
but
we
would
contend
that
the
waiting
period
is
not
reasonable.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
hall
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
richard
hall,
appellant
pro
se
in
this
case.
i
appear
this
morning
to
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
colorado,
which
decision
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
a
colorado
law
which
requires
that
a
voter
be
a
resident
of
the
state
of
colorado
for
six
months
before
being
allowed
to
vote
for
president
and
vice-president.
i
must
state
to
the
court
that
the
law
has
since
been
amended
by
the
colorado
legislature
and
it
now
requires
a
two-month
residence.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir.
the
facts
in
this
case--
mr.
richard
hall
i
wouldn't
have
been
able
to.
mr.
richard
hall
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir,
but
at
the
time,
i
was
disenfranchised
and
i
am
now
the
representative
of
a
class
of
all
voters
who
were
disenfranchised
by
similar
qualms.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
i
was
a
member
of
the
class
at
the
time
the
--
of
my
case,
your
honor,
and
i
was
disenfranchised
and
was
prevented
from
voting.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
the
residence
requirements
vary
per
state.
mr.
richard
hall
it
was
six
months
and
i
was
disenfranchised.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
the
problem
is
similar
in
all
the
states.
mr.
richard
hall
it
isn't
my
problem.
mr.
richard
hall
no,
sir.
my
class
was
the
class
in
colorado.
mr.
richard
hall
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
hall
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
hall
i
would've
represented
everyone
from
six
months
on
down
which
would've
included
people
who'd
been
there
two
months.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
it's
my
contention,
your
honor,
that
no
period
longer
than
the
registration
period
should
be
required
by
the
state.
colorado
allows
people
to
appear
and
register
up
until
the
friday
before
the
election.
they
evidently
feel
that
that's
the
amount
of
time
they
need
to
process
registration
applications.
mr.
richard
hall
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
hall
well,
i
think,
as
a
technical
matter
of
the
drafting
of
my
complaint,
that's
the
class
i
attempted
to
represent,
but
i
--
mr.
richard
hall
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and,
of
course,
the
question
won't
come
up
again.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir.
the
question
won't
come
up
again
until
1972,
maybe
people
who
are
in
colorado
now
who
will
not
be
there
then
and
maybe
people
who
will
move
into
colorado
--
mr.
richard
hall
if
i
acquired
a
residence
in
another
state
and
then
move
back
into
colorado
less
than
two
months
before
the
national
election,
no,
i
would
not
be
allowed
to
vote.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
i
would
feel
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
your
honor,
i
think,
first,
i
do
face
the
problem
i've
pointed
out
in
the
amicus
briefs
that
i
may
move
again
in
the
future.
i,
in
an
analogous
situation
of
the
taxpayer,
glass
versus
collin,
i
have
an
interest
in
other
people
being
allowed
to
vote.
their
ability
to
register
and
become
a
qualified
elector
affects
their
right
to
join
a
political
party
and
other
items,
and
i
do
believe
that
the
class
that
i
represent
is,
first,
nationwide
and,
secondly,
that
it
affects
people
who
will
be
affected.
we
don't
know
who
they
are,
but
we
know,
as
a
statistical
matter,
that
they
will
certainly
exist
in
1972.
and,
i
think
the
question
every
one
of
those
voters
will
face
will
be
the
same.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that
is
one
of
the
purposes.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
if
you
would
tip
to
that
--
mr.
richard
hall
well,
if
one
attempted
that,
he
would
be
in
violation
of
the
law
because
when
you
apply
in
colorado,
you
--
mr.
richard
hall
well,
yes,
sir.
the
question
is
whether
the
waiting
period
serves
that
purpose.
colorado
has
determined
that
you
don't
have
to
apply
for
the
ballot
until
the
friday
before
the
election.
so,
they
don't,
evidently,
feel
that
they
need
the
six
month
or
the
two
months
in
which
to
process
the
application,
perform
any
checks,
nor
does
colorado
attempt
to
contact
the
old
state
from
which
one
moved.
they
make
no
attempt
to
contact
california,
in
my
case.
so,
i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
that
they
used
the
waiting
period
for
the
purpose
you
ascribe
to
it.
mr.
richard
hall
some
states,
your
honor,
do
have
the
new
resident
fill
out
what
amounts
to
a
postcard
--
mr.
richard
hall
well,
the
question
is
whether
the
waiting
period
serves
any
state
purpose.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
your
honor
i
think
--
mr.
richard
hall
i
think
the
question
of
the
purity
of
election
is
a
legitimate
state
concern.
the
question
is
how
long
a
period
the
state
needs
to
serve
that
concern.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
i
think
the
question
is
similar
for
all
the
states,
yes,
sir.
and,
in
particular,
colorado,
first,
does
not
make
the
attempt
to
contact
the
old
state
and
they
feel
that
three
days
is
sufficient
time
for
their
purposes.
and,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
that,
therefore,
might
be
an
appropriate
period.
mr.
richard
hall
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
hall
it's
54
days,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
the
state
of
new
york
has
an
amicus
for
the
state
of
colorado
said
that
they
have
more
people,
maybe
that
a
state
could
show
that
they
have
added
problems
because
of
an
increase
population
and
--
mr.
richard
hall
well,
i
think
the
particular
states
would
have
to
show
a
legitimate
state
interest
to
support
their
particular
requirement.
new
york
claims
in
its
brief
that
they
had
added
problems
that
colorado
evidently
appeals
it
did
not
have.
so,
we
would
contend,
your
honor
--
yes,
sir?
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
hall
well
--
mr.
richard
hall
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
hall
well,
your
honor,
i
think
--
mr.
richard
hall
article
2
section
1
provides
that
the
state
can't
chose
the
man
in
which
presidential
electors
are
appointed,
but
once
they
decide
that
it's
to
be
done
by
popular
election.
i
would
suggest
that
harper
versus
virginia
board
of
elections
case,
for
example,
says
once
the
franchise
is
granted
to
the
electorate,
you
can't
have
classifications
that
invidiously
discriminate.
and,
i
think
this
case
affects
both
the
right
to
vote
and
the
right
to
travel,
both
of
which
have
been
held
by
this
court
very
recently
to
be
among
the
most
fundamental
and
precious
rights
we
have.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
i
believe
those
statements
come
from
cases
decided
in
an
earlier
day,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
recent
case
--
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir,
but
i
believe
the
recent
cases
such
as
kramer,
williams
versus
roads,
and
others
suggest
that
the
right
to
vote
is
a
fundamental
right
that
the
court
protects
with
the
most
rigid
scrutiny
and
that
applies
a
compelling
interest
test.
and,
the
question
is
whether
the
waiting
period
portion
of
the
residence
requirement
serves
a
compelling
state
interest.
my
question
is
what
interest
it
serves
at
all.
i
don't
believe
it
serves,
as
applied
in
the
state
of
colorado,
any
administrative
purposes.
furthermore,
the
traditional
justifications
that
one
should
be
a
member
of
the
community
in
which
he
seeks
to
vote
and
that
he'd
be
familiar
with
the
candidates
and
issues,
i
don't
believe
apply
in
the
particular
context
of
a
presidential
election
because
the
would-be
voter
is
a
member
of
the
community,
which
i
would
contend
is
a
national
one.
the
president
and
vice-president
are
the
only
people
elected
by
the
nation
as
a
whole
that
govern
the
nation
as
a
whole.
and,
i
believe
that
a
--
mr.
richard
hall
well,
they
are
elected
at
the
present
time
under
the
electoral
college
system.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
the
popular
view
is
that
they're
elected
by
the
people
that
it's
expression
of
the
national
--
mr.
richard
hall
will.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
that
may
be,
your
honor,
but
in
the
williams
versus
roads
case,
for
example,
the
state
attempted
to
rely
on
article
2
section
1
and
this
court
said
that
article
2
section
1
does
not
allow
a
state
to
set
up
requirements
that
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
so,
the
question
then
turns
whether
it
does
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
it's
my
contention,
under
the
compelling
interest
test
which
has
been
developed
by
this
court
in
right
to
vote
cases,
that
it
does
not
serve
any
state
purpose.
the
state
of
colorado
--
mr.
richard
hall
the
state
of
colorado,
your
honor,
has
said
you
could
register
up
until
friday
before
the
election.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir.
i
think
if
they
feel
--
mr.
richard
hall
they
apparently
feel
that
it
does,
your
honor.
i
think
that
would
be
sufficient
short.
i
would
be
in
favor
of
having
as
many
people
vote
as
possible,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
hall
i
doubt
it,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
hall
arguably,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
believe
i
would.
and,
i
think
that
there
are
no
special
voting
lists
to
be
made
up
or
holding
places
to
be
established.
in
the
state
of
colorado,
you
go
to
vote
at
the
county
clerk's
office
--
mr.
richard
hall
on
a
special
machine.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir,
i
would.
mr.
richard
hall
i
think
there
is
the
--
mr.
richard
hall
question
of
ensuring
that
the
voter
is
familiar
with
the
state
candidates
and
the
state
issues
so
that
he
can
vote
intelligently.
mr.
richard
hall
no,
sir.
i
think
the
--
mr.
richard
hall
the
electors,
perhaps,
your
honor,
but
the
people
who
vote
for
the
electors
vote
on
the
basis
of
national
issues
for
national
candidates.
the
information
they
learned
about
the
candidates
comes
from
national
sources.
i
feel
that
i
was
--
mr.
richard
hall
i
feel
the
dominant
issues
in,
for
example,
last
year's
campaign,
your
honor,
were
national
in
scope.
i
think
the
critical
issues
with
the
war
and
civil
rights,
and
inflation
and
crime,
i
think
those
are
national
problems.
i
don't
believe
that
the
effect
of
state
issues
placed
at
large
apart
in
--
mr.
richard
hall
a
selection
of
a
pres
--
mr.
richard
hall
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
the
majority
of
the
voters
vote
on
national
issues.
they
may
have
a
different
feel
about
some
of
those
national
issues,
but
i
think
that
they
are
paramount
issues
or
national
in
scope.
so,
i
think
a
voter
is
able
to
case
an
intelligent
ballot
and
i
think
that
meets
the
interest
of
the
state
in
that
particular
question,
and
that's
why
it's
different
than
a
state
or
local
election.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
as
i
say,
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
hall
first,
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
hall
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
problems
you
mention
are
local
instances
of
other
national
problems.
the
question
of
conservation
and
water
usage
is
a
national
one.
i
think
the
question
of
gun-control,
for
example,
might
be
looked
at
one
way
in
the
western
states
as
opposed
to
the
eastern
states
but,
nevertheless,
it
is
a
national
problem.
the
people
in
the
eastern
states
are
aware
of
the
problem.
mr.
richard
hall
and
furthermore,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
if
that
is
the
justification
the
state
wishes
to
comply,
as
expressed
in
carrington
versus
rash,
i
don't
believe
a
state
has
the
right
to
prevent
people
from
voting
because
of
a
concern
as
to
which
way
they
would
vote.
mr.
richard
hall
i
don't
claim
it's
of
absolutely
no
relevance,
your
honor,
but
i
do
think
that
the
dominant
influence
on
a
voter
in
the
presidential
election
are
national
issues.
local
issues
may
have
an
effect,
but
i
don't
believe
they
have
controlling
facts.
i
don't
believe
they
had
a
sufficient
effect
to
meet
a
compelling
state
interest.
i
contend,
your
honor,
that
the
question
is
whether
the
resident's
waiting
period
serves
a
legitimate
interest,
in
that,
it
affects
both
the
right
to
vote
and
the
right
to
travel
and
that
both
these
rights
are
protected
by
the
compelling
interest
test.
i
would
contend
that
the
residence
requirement,
in
particular
as
applied
by
the
state
of
colorado,
serves
none
of
these
purposes,
that
it,
therefore,
sets
up
a
discrimination
between
voters
that
is
not
supported
by
any
reason
and,
therefore,
would
be
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
this
is
a
problem
of,
i
would
contend,
some
national
significance.
figures
have
shown
recently
that
disenfranchised
voters
number
into
the
millions,
and
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
two
of
our
last
three
elections
have
been
very,
very
close.
and,
i
would
contend,
first,
as
just
the
magnitude
of
the
civil
liberties
problem
involved
that
five
million
voters
are
disenfranchised
and,
i
would
contend,
for
no
legitimate
reason,
that
this
is
a
problem
that
merits
correction.
the
district
court
in
colorado
itself
recognized
that
the
situation
was,
in
their
words,
unfair
and
unjust.
and,
i
would
hope
that
the
problem
could
be
corrected.
i
feel
that
the
requirement
is
unconstitutional,
both
the
original
six-month
requirement
and
as
amended
down
to
two
months.
i
don't
believe
the
state
of
colorado
can
show
that
it
needs
the
two
months
for
any
purpose.
they
do
not
attempt
to
use
the
two
months
for
any
purpose.
they
do
not
attempt
to
notify
the
old
state
and
take
the
voter
off
the
roles
to
prevent
double
voting.
it
may
be
that
that
would
be
a
good
idea,
but
they
don't
attempt
to
do
it.
so,
i
don't
believe
they
could
claim
at
this
time
that
that's
one
of
the
justifications
for
the
law.
i
don't
believe
that
the
case
of
drueding
versus
devlin,
which
was
affirmed
by
this
court
in
pre
curium
four
years
ago
on
similar
situation,
necessitates
an
affirmance
in
this
case.
i
believe
the
law,
since
drueding,
has
been
modified.
the
compelling
interest
test
has
come
into
play
by
this
court.
the
right
to
travel
in
the
shapiro
versus
thompson
case
involving
welfare
residents
requirements
as
--
mr.
richard
hall
well,
first,
your
honor,
the
right
to
travel
theory
that
came
up
in
the
shapiro
versus
thompson
was
not
before
the
drueding
court.
so,
there
is
a
different
theory
involved.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir,
i
believe
that's
correct,
but
i
believe
that
a
different
theory
is
present
here.
a
different
standard
of
evaluation
has
come
into
effect
since
then.
i
believe
that
article
2
section
1
has
been
downgraded
somewhat
since
then.
so,
i
don't
believe
there
are
any
obstacles
to
it.
furthermore,
i
believe
the
district
court
in
drueding
failed
to
analyze
the
national
community
doctrine
and,
of
course,
the
case
wasn't
argued
here.
it
wasn't
submitted
on
briefs.
so,
the
court
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
consider
it
as
fully
as
they
have
here.
so,
i
don't
believe
that
it
constitutes
a
scope
of
an
obstacle
that
some
cases
might
--
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir,
nor
do
i
believe,
your
honors,
that
the
question
is
moot.
first,
the
fact
that
the
election
is
over,
i
don't
believe
makes
the
case
moot
because
another
presidential
election
will
appear
in
1972.
as
a
matter
of
statistical
certainty,
we
know
under
the
present
framework
of
the
laws
that
millions
of
voters
will
be
disenfranchised.
this
is
what
the
statistics
show
us.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
i
have
referred
in
brief,
your
honor,
to
statistics
introduced
by
senator
kennedy
in
support
of
a
bill
he
introduced
in
congress,
which
he
had
prepared
by
the
bureau
of
the
census,
and
those
figures
are
set
forth
in
a
particular
page
in
the
congressional
order.
mr.
richard
hall
no,
sir.
i
don't
believe
there
are
any
figures
that
show
how
many
people
actually
applied.
it
may
be
that
they
made
private
inquiry
and
found
out
that
the
rule
was
and
simply
didn't
bother
to
apply,
but
the
rule
was
there.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
we
don't
know
that,
your
honor,
but,
as
i
say,
they
may
have
made
private
inquiry
or
articles
come
out
in
the
paper
before
election
about
what
the
registration
requirements
are
and
they
could
just,
in
the
privacy
of
their
living
room,
read
that
they
are
not
eligible
and
not
make
the
effort
to
go
down
and
apply.
so,
i
don't
believe
that
we
could
hold
that
against
the
question.
there
are
reliable
statistics
that
a
substantial
number
anywhere
from
two
million
which
was
senator
kennedy's
figures,
five
million
which
was
the
result
of
a
statistical
survey
by
the
ballot
poll,
eight
million
which
was
the
result
of
a
presidential
commission
which
studied
the
problem.
so,
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
the
figure
is
in
the
millions
of
people
who
could've
been
disenfranchised.
and,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
how
many
people
actually
made
application.
so,
i
would
suggest
that
the
question
is
not
moot
because
the
1968
election
is
over
because
we're
going
to
have
another
presidential
election
in
four
years.
mr.
richard
hall
no,
sir,
nor
do
i
feel
that
the
amendment
of
the
law
down
to
two
months
makes
the
case
moot,
first,
because
i
feel
that
the
two-month
requirement
still
has
the
question
of
being
unreasonable
and,
secondly,
there
are
20
states
in
the
union
that
still
have
a
requirement
of
six
months
or
longer.
so,
as
a
national
problem,
and
i
would
contend
that
it
is
a
national
problem,
the
issues
involved
are
the
same
for
all
the
states
that
six
months,
as
a
standard,
is
still
the
precedent
of
the
united
states.
it's
still
affecting
voters.
and,
if
i
have
--
if
i
represent
the
class
of
voters
throughout
the
united
states,
which
i
would
certainly
suggest,
then
the
question
of
six
months
is
still
before
the
court.
so,
i
don't
believe
the
question
is
moot.
i
do
feel
that
the
law,
since
drueding,
undercuts
the
theory
of
that
case.
the
right
to
vote
and
the
right
to
travel
have
both
been
protected
by
very
strict
scrutiny
and
compelling
interest
test,
and
i
would
ask
that
this
court
set
the
matter
or
declare
the
colorado
requirement
unconstitutional
on
that
basis.
mr.
richard
hall
the
lowest?
mr.
richard
hall
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
no
requirement
at
all,
your
honor.
as
i
understand
the
wisconsin
law,
you
could
come
in
the
day
of
election
and
sign
up.
nebraska
and
--
nebraska
has
two
days.
alaska
and
ohio
have
four
days.
north
dakota
has
10
days.
mr.
richard
hall
no,
sir,
just
for
the
presidential
election.
many
states
have
made
special
provision
for
just
the
presidential
election
because
they
realize
that
the
issues
involved
are
different.
mr.
richard
hall
as
has
colorado,
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir,
i
am
finished.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
richard
hall
that
question
wasn't
decided
by
the
district
court
because
they
decided
against
me
personally.
i
would
contend
that
the
class
is
everyone
who
was
disenfranchised
by
a
similar
state
or
precinct
and
county.
i
think
the
issues
are
the
same.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir,
that
would
be
my
contention.
mr.
richard
hall
well,
at
the
time,
i
was
representing
people
trying
to
vote
in
1968,
but
i
would
contend
that
i
--
the
question
is
the
same
and
will
come
up
--
mr.
richard
hall
but
it
constantly
exists.
we
know
that
it
will
exist
in
1972.
mr.
richard
hall
we
know
that
there
will
be
new
ones,
your
honor.
that's
just
what
statistics
tell
us.
they
will
move
and,
in
1972,
they
will
be
disenfranchised.
mr.
richard
hall
prospectively,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
hall
and
also,
i
would
point
out
--
mr.
richard
hall
everyo
--
prospectively,
you
could
say
that.
yes,
sir.
also,
as
the
amicus
brief
of
mr.
harvey
burg
points
out,
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts
is
presently
withholding
a
decision
in
a
case
compiled
there,
pending
the
determination
of
this
case.
so,
we
have
at
least
one
district
court
of
the
united
states
that's
specifically
waiting
to
see
how
this
case
comes
out
because
they
feel
it
will
affect
their
decision.
so,
the
question
is
still
with
us,
your
honors,
and
i
don't
believe
it's
moot.
i
would
ask
that
the
court
decide
it
and
that
the
unfairness
and
injustice,
as
the
district
court
puts
it,
of
disenfranchising
that
many
voters
for
the
most
important
election
in
the
country
be
removed.
if
the
court
please,
i
shall
close
at
this
time
in
grants
of
a
few
closing
remarks
after
mr.
baker
is
finished.
mr.
richard
hall
yes,
sir.
very
briefly,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry
if
i
misstated
the
colorado
law.
i
quoted
what
i
thought
was
the
controlling
statute
that's
contained
on
page
31
of
my
brief,
and
i
did
understand
that
they
could
apply
up
to
three
days
before
the
election.
on
the
question
of
mootness,
mr.
baker
relies
on
mills
versus
green
which
was
decided
in
1895.
i
would
rely
on
moore
versus
ogilvie
which
was
decided
six
months
ago,
which
held
that
a
continuing
problem
such
as
this
and
that
case
involved
illinois
election
law,
was
not
moot.
i
think
the
fact
the
district
court
upheld
the
reasonableness
of
six
months
is
not
controlling
because
they
did
so
under
the
traditional
test
and
did
apply
the
compelling
interest
test
that
now
applies
to
the
right
to
vote.
any
reliance
on
the
case
of
pope
versus
williams
is
misplaced
because
that
particularly
left
opened
the
question
of
presidential
electors.
this
question
of
voting
in
more
than
one
state,
we
do
not
argue
against
the
requirement
that
you
be
a
resident
of
the
state
in
which
you
vote.
and,
as
in
carrington
versus
rash,
the
state
can
impose
reasonable
requirements
to
see
that
you're
a
resident,
but
we
would
contend
that
the
waiting
period
is
not
reasonable.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
