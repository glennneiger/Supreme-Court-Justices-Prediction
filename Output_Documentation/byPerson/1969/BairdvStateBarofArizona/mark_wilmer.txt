mr.
mark
wilmer
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
at
the
outset
it
might
be
appropriate
and
go
serviceable
to
the
court,
if
we
would
first
put
in
proper
relationship,
proper
context
the
record
in
the
court
below.
i
would
say
at
the
outset
that
the
position
of
the
respondent
is
not
one
of
an
advocate
either
way
so
far
as
this
question
of
finality
is
concerned.
as
we
review
our
responsibility
here
to
simply
to
bring
to
the
court
the
facts
with
respect
to
this
question
and
then
proceed
on
to
as
best
we
can
explain
the
other
proceedings
in
the
court
below.
i
think
the
best
way
to
put
the
record
in
proper
relationship
to
the
actual
facts
is
perhaps
to
begin
with
the
response
which
was
filed
by
the
committee
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona.
now,
it
is
my
understanding
from
reading
rules
of
this
court
that
papers
that
are
certified
by
the
clerk
of
the
lower
court
are
part
of
the
record
and
subject
to
being
considered
in
this
case.
i
say
that
for
this
reason
that
the
appendix
which
is
part
of
the
petitioners
filing
with
this
court
excerpts
from
the
committee's
response
to
our
supreme
court,
certain
portions
of
that
response,
necessarily
when
this
matter
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
committee,
the
full
impact,
the
full
exposure
of
this
case
in
this
court,
was
not
readily
understood,
and
accordingly
we
did
not
enlarge
upon
the
printed
portions
of
the
response
of
the
arizona
committee
on
examinations
to
the
arizona
supreme
court.
the
original,
however,
is
in
the
record
and
i
would
like
briefly
to
refer
to
that
with
the
court's
permission.
i
say
that
for
this
reason
that
we
have
indicated
our
position
as
one
of
simply
here
are
the
facts
we
made
us
on
the
citing
of
the
case
now
as
any
other
time
if
in
fact
this
court
has
jurisdiction.
the
court
will
recall
that
it
has
been
brought
to
the
court's
attention
that
the
proceeding
in
the
arizona
supreme
court
was
initiated
by
a
petition
for
an
order
to
show
cause,
directed
to
the
committee
on
examinations
and
admissions.
and
referring
to
the
appendix
before
i
move
on,
the
prayer
of
that
petition
read
as
follows,
the
arizona
supreme
court,
“wherefore
your
petitioners
pray
that
this
court
make
another
its
order
requiring
the
committee
on
examinations
and
admissions
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona
be
in
appear
before
this
court
of
at
to
date
at
a
time
certain
then
an
order
to
show
cause,
if
any
it
may
have,
quite
petitioner
should
not
be
forth
with
recommended
for
admission
by
the
state
to
the
state
bar
or
in
the
alternative
show
cause
like
petitioner's
applications
should
not
be
processed
by
the
committee
without
requiring
the
petitioner,
any
further
answer
--
of
petitioner
any
further
answer
to
the
question
27
of
applicant's
questionnaire
and
affidavit.”
the
court
would
recall
this
is
a
question
which
asked,
“have
you
ever
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
any
organizations
which
supports
the
overthrowing
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
and
violence?”
the
opening
portion
on
the
memorandum
which
the
committee
filed
with
the
arizona
supreme
court
reads
as
follows:
“applicant
in
a
main
treats
the
posture
of
our
application
to
the
committee
as
rejected
by
the
committee,
and
from
this
false
premise
enlarges
upon
a
proposed
constitutional
rights
of
the
applicant.
nothing
could
be
chored
from
the
true
fact.”
mr.
mark
wilmer
i'm
reading
your
honor
and
then
i'm
sorry
this
is
not
in
the
printed
appendix,
your
honor.
it
is
in
the
original
of
the
respond
certified
by
the
clerk
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
to
this
court.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
your
honor,
i
must
say
it
frankly,
i
didn't
suppose
it
would
be
needed
at
the
time
when
i
read
the
appendix
as
certified.
in
other
words,
we
did
not
have
a
complete
view
of
the
flow
of
the
case
in
this
court
as
to
what
or
would
not
be
material.
because
i
read
your
rules
and
i
assume
i
am
correct.
even
though
it
is
not
printed
in
the
appendix,
nonetheless
say
for
this
part
of
the
certified
record,
it
may
be
referred
to
before
this
court.
of
course
if
that
is
not
true,
i
should
not
do
so.
mr.
mark
wilmer
it
should
be,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
this
would
be
the
responds
of
the
committee
to
the
petitioner's
order
to
show
cause
and
may
i
please
the
court
in
this
arizona
supreme
court.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes
your
honor,
i'm
sure.
i'm
sorry
i
have
finally
realized
the
moment
(inaudible).
that
is
if
it
would
have
been
a
better
applicant
in
the
main
treats
the
posture
of
our
application
to
the
committee
as
rejected
by
the
committee
and
from
this
fault's
premise
enlarges
upon
the
supposed
in
constitutional
rights
of
the
applicant.
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
true
fact
as
this
appears
from
the
letter
of
april
24,
1968
attached
to
the
affidavit
of
robert
a.
gellin
where
the
court
will
recall
this
chief
counsel
for
a
petitioner.
the
committee
has
not
rejected
the
application
of
sarah
baird
and
does
not
intend
to
do
so,
unless
and
until
further
facts
appear
which
would
warrant
this
rejection.
i
would
say
in
this
context,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
this
letter
of
robert
--
to
mr.
robert
a.
gellin
and
antedated
the
application
of
the
petitioner
for
an
order
to
show
cause
to
the
arizona
supreme
court.
in
other
words,
this
was
the
discussion
of
counsel
prior
to
the
initiation
of
this
proceeding.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
her
application,
your
honor,
which
still
as
it
is
today
sitting
on
our
shelves
waiting
for
her
to
either
move
her
mandamuses
to
complete
the
processing
of
it
or
something
else
would
have
happen.
in
our
position
of
that
may
i
say
this
briefly
your
honor.
the
committee
on
examinations
and
admissions
is
a
criterion
hand
made
of
the
arizona
supreme
court.
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
have
no
authority
other
than
that
which
the
court
gives
us
and
i
might
say
if
it
should
become
of
consequence,
the
entire
rules
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
that
are
in
volume
i
believe
it
is
17
of
west
publishing
companies
of
arizona
revised
statues.
they
govern,
they
limit,
they
set
to
the
extent
of
our
authority.
we
have
no
inherent
authority
or
any
kind,
the
rights
other
than
oath
givens
by
the
rules.
therefore,
when
the
court
says
to
us,
ask
these
questions
and
they're
set
out
verbatim
and
this
is
one
of
them.
get
the
answers
from
them
and
then
you
proceed
to
certify
to
this
court
your
opinion.
we
have
no
choice
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
we
are
stymied.
we
cannot
reject
it
much
more
as
we
could
if
we
want
to
be
arbitrary,
perhaps
we
should.
i
don't
know
but
the
facts
are
that
in
less
and
until
that
question
is
answered
or
someone
tells
us
that
we
most
do
something
else
that
case
with
that
matter
we'll
say
it
as
it
is.
mr.
mark
wilmer
only
to
this
extents,
your
honor.
the
committee
has
no
authority
one
way
or
the
other
to
admit
or
reject
anyone.
we
merely
make
a
recommendation
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
does
the
admission,
does
the
rejection.
i
would
say
this
if
it
may
please
the
court
that
justice
harlan
by
interaction
between
the
rule
and
the
committee's
action
for
practical
purposes,
i
would
conceive
that
mrs.
baird
is
for
the
moment
at
least
effectively
stymied.
now,
whether
she
should
bring
a
mandamus
and
in
that
faction
call
upon
the
arizona
supreme
court
to
make
an
effective
ruling
that
is
not
automated
within
our
providence.
i
would
simply
say
that
as
are
the
moment
at
least,
the
arizona
supreme
court
has
been
told
by
the
committee.
we
haven't
made
our
decision.
we
are
unable
to
make
a
decision
and
therefore
we
submit
the
matters
as
it
is
and
the
court
simply
said,
“well
we
deny
the
petition,
you
should
complete
due
process
in
this
petition.”
now,
whether
that
amounts
to
finality
or
not
within
the
rule
of
this
court,
i
don't
know,
i
express
the
opinion
as
to
it,
i
simply
bring
it
to
the
court's
attention.
i
might
say
though
for
the
purpose
of
my
next
statement
to
the
court
that
this
letter
of
april
24,
1968
which
antedated
the
beginning
of
this
proceeding
to
mr.
allen
as
chief
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
i
believe
has
some
of
validity
and
some
value
in
determining
what
in
effect,
what
in
fact
i
should
say
is
the
actual
position
of
the
committee
in
the
court
below
and
the
committee
here.
this
letter
said,
i
also
believe,
that
mrs.
baird
should
realize
that
even
though
she
answered
the
question,
“did
she
had
at
one
time
been
communist
or
had
had
otherwise
been
associated
with
the
organizations
not
regarded
as
friendly
to
the
united
states
government?”
this
would
not
necessarily
cause
us
to
reject
her
application.
we
would
undoubtly
want
to
ask
you
some
questions
as
to
her
present
beliefs
and
as
to
the
other
matters
which
would
bear
upon
the
effect
of
such
membership
would
have
are
their
qualification
to
practice
law.
the
committee
is
aware
that
under
presence
of
supreme
court
decisions,
mere
membership
in
an
organization
is
not
sufficient
necessarily
to
disqualify
rank
and
positions
of
responsibility
and
this
would
be
the
added
through
the
committee
in
this
matter.
now,
i
say
that
for
this
position
for
this
reason
if
it
please
the
court.
we
have
had
here
what
i
would
term
some
rather
fancy
steps
down
the
sidelines,
so
to
speak,
of
what
words
mean.
i
believe
that
as
we
proceed,
we'll
find
the
committee
made
it
an
unequivocally
and
plainly
apparent
to
mrs.
baird.
we
were
not
concern
with
what
her
beliefs
were
such.
we
are
not
concerned
with
looking
inside
her
heart
to
see
what
she
believe
or
didn't
believe
in.
we
were
concerned
with
finding
out
did
she
have
the
qualification
which
should
make
her
a
lawyer,
which
would
justify
us
in
certifying
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
that
in
fact
she
would
be
a
lawyer
that
the
court
would
be
proud
of
having
admitted.
now,
a
fair
reading,
i
believe
if
it
please
the
court
of
the
committee's
a
letter
to
mr.
allen.
the
committee's
response
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
have
our
response
here
indicates
simply
one
thing
whether
we
use
the
word
"belief"
or
whether
we
use
the
word
"view"1
or
whatever
word
we
use.
we
are
concerned
with
one
thing.
i
heard
yesterday
the
questioned
ask
if
mr.
baird
would
prefer
the
question
he
presented
here
whether
the
record
he's
made
in
the
court
below
or
here.
and
i
believe
he
said
here.
i
have
to
confess
surprise.
i
wrote
them
both
and
i
really
didn't
think
i
was
saying
anything
different
one
time
than
the
other.
i
thought
we
were
saying
to
the
court
below
and
the
thought
we're
saying
to
this
court
that
if
mrs.
baird
believes
in
the
sense
that
she
would
actively
advocate
and
assist
and
advance
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
the
states
of
arizona
by
force
and
violence,
we
want
no
pardon
nor
will
we
recommend
her
for
admission
to
our
arizona
supreme
court
unless
and
until
we
are
told
to
do
so
by
some
higher
authority.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
right.
mr.
mark
wilmer
below?
your
honor,
i
meant
by
that
that
she
was
prepared
to
go
out
and
walk
up
and
down
the
streets
and
take
other
step
necessary
to
advance.
mr.
mark
wilmer
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
advocating
the
government
--
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence?
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
would
say
if
it
please
the
court
that
number
one
that
that
would
contravene
the
canon
of
ethics,
which
said
you
shall
do
nothing
to
bring
at
disrepute
the
profession
of
the
law
or
the
court.
therefore,
i
would
say
that
if
mrs.
baird
said,
i
propose
to
walk
up
and
down
the
streets
out
for
--
i'm
admitted
as
a
lawyer
and
proclaiming
to
the
world
that
i
a
lawyer
believed
we
should
blow
up
the
capital,
assassinate
public
officials
and
otherwise
change
that
form
of
this
government
by
force
we
want
no
pardon
of
her
unless
we're
told
we
must
let
her
in.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
don't
like
which
one?
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
would
have
no
problem
with
that
at
all.
i
think
that's
her
privilege.
that's
her
privilege.
mr.
mark
wilmer
the
line
that
i
draw
your
honor
is
when
you
talk
about
destruction
of
this
government
by
force
and
violence.
mr.
mark
wilmer
pardon.
mr.
mark
wilmer
the
committee's
position
your
honor
was
not
just
a
belief.
your
committee,
the
committee's
position
was
actively
accept
and
actively
advanced
that
philosophy
and
that
solution.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
certainly.
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
couldn't
care
a
less
what
are
beliefs
are
in
any
field
except
that
which
endangers
directly
upon
the
validity
and
the
utility
of
her
service
as
a
lawyer
as
to
those
matters
we
are
concerned
and
we're
critically
concerned.
now,
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
would
say
your
(voice
overlap)
the
occasion
is
right,
you
would
do
it,
yes
and
i
don't
believe
that
person
should
be
a
lawyer.
mr.
mark
wilmer
they
would
have
been
incorporated
in
the
questions
asked.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
our
rules
provide
your
honor
that
in
making
its
investigation,
the
committee
can
conduct
an
informal
or
formal
investigation.
it
can
interrogate
a
witness
in
formally
with
the
understanding
that
if
that
interrogation
is
to
be
made
a
part
of
the
decision,
it
must
then
to
conform
or
it
must
go
on
record
but
i
have
tried
to
say
numerous
times,
we
would
simply
call
mrs.
baird
and
say,
“look
what
do
you
really
believe
about
this?
do
you?
are
you
prepared
if
you're
admitted
to
practice
should
a
crisis
arrive
that
the
government
is
threaten
with
violence,
are
your
hands
completely
free
and
are
you
as
a
citizen
completely
able
to
stand
behind
the
forces
of
government
which
you
firmly
uphold
when
you
become
a
lawyer?
or
that
point
will
you
retire
and
negate
the
oath
which
you
took?
mr.
mark
wilmer
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor,
i
can't
answer
that
that
other
than
to
say
has
been
there
for
at
least
10
years
to
my
knowledge
and
i
would
assume
many
years
prior
to
that.
i
think
it
is
not
an
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
pardon.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no,
as
far
as
i
know
your
honor.
the
rules
as
they
now
--
that
is
these
rules
as
they
now
stand
are
those
that
probably
i
answered
four
years
ago
but
i
can't
swear
to
that,
i
don't
remember.
it's
been
a
long
time,
we'll
put
it
that
way.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
if
he
has
a
usual
question
whether
not
they
have
been
involved
in
fraud
whether
or
not
they
have
been
bonded
and
if
such,
there
had
a
bond
claim
it
against
him
and
have
they
been
involved
in
any
criminal
actions?
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes.
yes,
i'm
sure
we're
not
going
to
say
you
refuse
to
tell
us
if
you
stole
money
somewhere
so
we're
going
to
admit
you
anyway.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
can
say
this
in
all
honestly,
your
honor,
we've
admitted
people
at
their
younger
age
have
been
guilty
of
burglary,
statutory
rape
or
what
have
she
questioned
have
been
rehabilitated?
do
they
now
measure
up
to
the
standards
of
who
or
what
a
person
should
be
or
appear
she
desires
to
be
a
lawyer?
mr.
mark
wilmer
to
27?
mr.
mark
wilmer
no,
it
would
not
bar
her.
no,
no,
no
your
honor.
it
would
not.
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
would
then
endeavor
to
find
out
how
deep
did
that
belief
lie.
and
if
it
lay
on
the
surface
and
then
simply
a
childish
thing,
a
passing
fancy
that's
one
thing.
if
it
descended
to
the
depths
of
an
embedded
truth,
fanatical,
getting
the
government
should
be
destroyed.
i
therefore
then
feel
it
that
person
should
not
be
admitted
to
practice
law.
now,
i
would
like
to
simply
say
then
your
honor
that
we
are
told
that
this
belief
that
mrs.
berg
talks
about
is
a
political
belief,
it's
a
political
matter,
its
something
which
is
protected
by
the
decision
of
this
court.
therefore,
we
should
not
be
permitted
to
inquire
under
thought
processes
connection
with
it.
i
find
it
difficult,
if
it
please
the
court,
to
believe
that
the
notion
of
a
bomb
dropped
at
the
appropriate
time
in
17
different
places
in
the
united
states
and
then
attempt
to
take
over
the
government
is
a
political
matter
and
that
is
what
i
read
into
the
notion
of
overthrowing
this
government
by
force
and
violence.
1i
do
not
read
into
the
notion
of
assassination
of
public
officials,
members
of
the
congress
or
other
persons
which
in
positions
of
authority
for
the
bad
purpose.
i
do
not
read
that
as
a
political
activity
or
as
a
political
belief
which
is
subject
to
protection.
some
years
back,
unfortunately
we
had
i
suppose
what
was
then
considered
a
form
of
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
western
states
and
unfortunately
in
other
places
commonly
known
as
necktie
parties.
but
all
of
these
are
true
that
when
that
unfortunate
individual
was
strung
up
who
is
suspected
of
having
been
a
rapist,
suspected
of
having
been
a
murderer
or
whatever
capital
thief,
whatever
you
want
to
term
it.
i
suspect
that
you
might
turn
not
the
administration
of
justice
but
i
don't
believe
that
you
would
term
that
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
sense
that
we
are
speaking
of
the
administration
of
justice
today
and
by
like
talking,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
notion
of
violence,
a
violent
overthrow
the
government
of
this
country
for
the
very
purpose
of
destroying
it
as
a
political
belief,
if
so
on
smarter
than
i
will
have
to
convince
the
other.
now,
i
should
deal
briefly
if
it
please
the
court
to
this
public
versus
--
spevack
versus
klein
which
is
of
course
the
--
probably
the
case
that
expand
many
of
these
things
that
are
now
coming
to
life.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
mark
wilmer
incrimination?
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
would
not
raise
the
point
that
it
was
not
--
that
is
was
not
adequately
raised
your
honor.
i
would
not
raise
that
because
i
think
at
least
we
were
unnoticed
to
the
fact
that
she
deserves
that.
mr.
mark
wilmer
the
answer
to
the
question
as
given
on
the,
in
their,
on
the
affidavit
was
not
applicable.
i
frankly
do
not
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
i
would
have
to
say
your
honor
my
recollection
is
that
probably
it
was
raised.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes
i
would
say
it.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
think
it
was
mr.
baird,
i'm
sure
i
can
qualify
my
answer
one
where
the
other
be
but
my
recollection
inside
in
this
discussion
with
mr.
allen
and
in
related
matters
that
at
least
to
put
the
point
we'd
brought
up
that
this
amounted
to
incrimination.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
your
honor
the
problem
with
that
year
that
there's
the
brief,
relatively
brief
petition
filed.
the
relatively
brief
response
with
the
memorandum
and
the
argument
was
not
reported.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes.
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor,
i
have
to
confess,
which
i
don't
know.
if
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
with
the
file
but
i
don't
have
a
sharp
enough
recollection
at
the
moment
to
answer
your
honor
and
be
of
service
to
you.
i
would
simply
say
with
respect
to
the
klein
case
which
of
course
says
that
the
lawyer
may
not
be
disbarred
for
refusing
to
answer
the
question
that
is
relative
at
the
fifth
amendment?
i
think
that
that
case
is
not
readily
distinguishable.
i
would
be
little
optimistic
to
say
that
but
i
would
say
it
is
distinguishable
and
i
think
it
is
distinguishable
on
adequate
grounds
and
that
is
the
fifth
amendment
situation,
if
it
please
you,
mr.
justice
white.
i
don't
like
to
use
this
illustration
but
i
can't
think
of
none
more
apt
and
that
is
this.
in
arizona
and
massachusetts
and
florida
and
washington,
they
have
what
is
called
dog
race
and
in
that
particular
activity
which
is
per
mutual
betting
situation.
dogs
that
have
never
run
are
what
are
called
schooled.
in
other
words
they
are
run
through
the
race
as
if
it
was
a
race.
there
time
is
recorded,
the
whole
thing
is
recorded
just
like
any
race
track
in
which
way
with
desire
to
know
about
any
dog
or
horse.
and
based
on
that
when
they
do
start
running
they
are
(inaudible).
well,
now
the
reason
that
is
you
has
a
track
record.
you
have
something
to
go
over
and
those
that
have
been
on
the
track
and
have
run
have
already
established
themselves
and
i
say
therefore
that
when
someone
comes
who
has
not
have
a
track
record
as
to
we
have
no
background,
then
rightfully
a
different
rule
should
apply
than
from
a
lawyer
who
has
been
admitted
to
practice
which
established
his
reputation
or
his
ability
relative
to
practice,
who
has
in
all
things
carry
himself
such
at
the
bar
may
property
criticized.
and
then
therefore,
i
say
that
when
we
say
that
a
lawyer
who
has
been
admitted
to
practice
who
is
a
practicing
lawyer
should
be
permitted
to
take
the
fifth
amendment,
i
would
readily
distinguish
that
from
the
applicant
who
is
a
raw
product,
if
i
may
use
that,
that
expression,
whose
qualifications,
whose
future,
whose
ability
is
unknown
that
then
we
must
judge
and
therefore
we
are
entitled
to
ask
many
questions,
we
probably
should
not
and
could
not
answer
at
admitted
lawyer.
i
would
just
say
and
closely
if
it
please
the
court
that
there
are
some
very
sound
reasons
for
the
formality
of
this
affidavit
and
the
application.
i
realized
it
is
perhaps
since
burdens
at
some
of
the
outset
but
without
attempting
if
it
please
the
court
to
appear
critical
of
our
law
schools.
i
think
one
of
the
biggest
problems
that
is
met
by
the
bar
today
and
by
the
administrative
committee
is
a
complete
default
in
many
of
the
law
schools
of
any
attempt
to
teach
ethics
at
all,
of
any
attempt
to
teach
professional
responsibility
and
it
is
only
when
we
bring
these
young
people
up
short
against
an
application
which
indicates,
this
is
a
mighty
important
thing.
this
is
a
type
of
practice
that
is
very,
very
important
that
all
these
things
declared
before
you
may
practice.
we
think
that
tends
to
bring
to
their
mind
and
perhaps
the
consciousness
of
the
importance
of
this.
i
might
just
say
it
in
one
more
other
thing.
seven
or
eight
years
ago,
ohio
supreme
court
at
the
committees
request,
adopted
a
rule
that
says
you
can't
be
admitted
to
practice
until
you
pass
the
examination
of
professional
ethics.
you
can't
be
admitted
until
you
have
passed
that
examination.
i
will
say
this
that
we
no
longer
have
applicant
who
spell
canons
of
ethics,
c-a-n-n-o-n-s
then
i
can
spell
up.
we
do
not
catch
anyone
on
the
basis
of
that
requirement.
we
teach
them
how
the
lawyers,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
this
is
an
important
profession
and
that
ethics
is
probably
the
most
important
part
of
it
and
therefore
this
type
of
an
application,
we
feel,
is
highly
important
as
bringing
ho1me
to
the
extent
we
can
to
the
applicant,
this
is
a
mighty
important
thing
you're
going
into.
this
was
a
very,
very
serious
thing
that
you're
going
into.
these
questions
are
necessary
because
unless
you
live
a
road
of
spotless
life
you
don't
belong
in
our
profession.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no,
but
i
think
perhaps
that
this
might
be
an
indication
we
should
your
honor.
i
like
to
say
these
are
old,
old
questions
and
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
i'm
not
at
all
here
defending
them.
i'm
simply
here
saying
that
these
are
what
we
lived
with.
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor,
they
are
both
the
management
if
they're
now
and
raising
the
question
of
residency
as
being
a
right
or
any
residency
in
the
light
of
a
shapiro
case.
we're
now
having
a
span
of
objections
to
any
requirement
of
residency
because
of
shapiro
case.
so,
that
for
that
as
to
this
one
question
they
seem
to
have
become
reconciled
answer.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no,
your
honor
but
i
would
not
make
a
point
of
that
because
my
recollection
is
at
mrs.
braid
did
answered,
if
she
haven't
been
sure
we
wouldn't
made
a
point
of
it.
i
cannot
recall
in
detail
what
her
answer
was
but
i
know
it
satisfied
us
or
we
would
have
or
should
have
been
but
of
my
recollection
is
she
did
list
quite
a
number
for
organizations
but
it
is
not
here
and
i
would
take
responsible
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
i'd
be
glad
to
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no
(voice
overlap).
mr.
mark
wilmer
if
i
had
realized
it
that
we
would
have
it
here
your
honor
but
we'd
be
very
happy
to
do
it,
supply
it
ourselves.
mrs.
baird
can
supply
whatever
she
can
be.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
the
broadness
of
the
question
states
all
of
the
decisions.
mr.
mark
wilmer
it
would
do
it
in
my
judgment
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
would
accept
it
on
its
face
value
among
something
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
correct.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i'm
trying
to
make
that
point
your
honor
that
we
do
not
have
the
facilities
to
chase
down
each
organization
and
we
feel
that
if
someone
knows
it
that
she
tell
us
but
we
do
disagree
with
a
notion
that
they
are
oblige
to
research
and
that
all
they
need
to
say
is
i
don't
know
if
they
don't
know.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
mark
wilmer
my
interpretation
of
that
question
your
honor
is
really
that
it
is
a
duplication
of
27.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
i
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
she
didn't
answer
27.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
i'm
sure
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
at
the
outset,
i
think
make
two
observations.
first
being
that
the
committee
has
no
part
to
exclude
anybody
from
the
practice
of
law
in
the
state
of
arizona.
so
please
bear
in
mind
the
fact
that
the
court
is
not
abdicated
and
shut
its
prerogatives
in
that
respect.
mr.
mark
wilmer
referring
to
the
committee,
we
were
advice
by
counsel
that
the
committee
had
refused
to
or
had
excluded
sara
baird
from
admission
to
practice.
my
only
observation
is
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona
enjoys
that
prerogative
and
not
this
committee.
i
think
to
put
this
case
in
what
i
would
consider
to
be
a
true
perspective
as
to
what’s
really
at
issue
here,
it
might
be
well
that
just
first
briefly
review
the
actual
procedures
in
the
state
of
arizona
in
relationship
to
the
problem
which
is
before
this
court.
we
have
filed
for
the
convenience
of
the
court
with
the
clerk
copies
of
the
printed
rules
adopted
by
our
supreme
court.
these
rules
are
found
in
the
arizona
revised
statutes
in
volume
17
in
the
packet
part
but
for
the
convenience
of
the
court
since
these
are
printed
for
all
applicants,
we
have
supplied
the
clerk
with
printed
copies
and
these
copies
as
supplied
are
those
applicable
at
the
time
of
this
controversy.
there
are
certain
amendments
indicated
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
matter.
they
relate
the
fees
in
that
matter
which
are
not
involved
here
so
for
the
purposes
of
this
problem,
this
controversy,
the
printed
rules
are
appropriate
and
are
authentic.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
beg
your
pardon.
no,
your
honor,
i’m
speaking
of
a
small
pamphlet
like
this
that
was
given
to
the
--
a
number
of
them
to
the
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
no,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no,
there
are
more
rules
than
that,
your
honor
and
i
will
make
specific
reference
to
what
i’m
speaking
of.
i’m
referring
to
the
responsibility
and
the
function
which
a
committee
performs.
i’m
referring
to
the
problem
that
was
before
this
committee
which
caused
this
committee
to
take
the
position
it
did
and
which
has
led
to
this
controversy.
for
counsel,
i
am
sure
inadvertently
stated
that
sara
baird
had
been
rejected
for
admission
to
the
bar
of
the
state
of
arizona.
this
is
an
inaccurate
statement.
the
matter
is
like
mohammed’s
coffin,
suspended
between
heaven
and
earth.
the
committee
has
made
no
recommendation
to
the
court
and
the
court
has
made
no
ruling
in
the
matter.
the
rules
first
provide
with
respect
to
the
obligation
to
the
committee.
no
applicant
shall
--
will
be
examined
until
this
application
has
been
considered
enacted
upon
by
and
permission
granted
by
the
committee
to
take
such
examination.
no
permission
shall
be
grant
--
will
be
granted
until
it
is
established
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
committee
and
there
follows
a
number
of
things
the
supreme
court
requires
of
the
committee
that
they
affirmatively
find
before
they
permit
the
applicant
to
sit
for
the
examination.
the
rules
provide
that
the
applicant
must
file
an
affidavit
and
questionnaire
and
that
mr.
justice
black
is
the
instrument
that
is
printed
as
the
appendix
and
it
is
also
contained
in
this
little
pamphlet
which
i
have
distributed.
the
rule
and
i’m
reading
from
page
5
of
the
pamphlet,
“after
said
applicants
questionnaire
and
affidavit
fully
answered
under
oath
is
filed,
the
committee
will
make
such
investigation
as
it
deems
proper
for
the
purposes
of
determining
whether
or
not
the
applicant
possesses
the
qualifications
specified
in
rule
6
such
investigation
were
ordinarily
not
required
within
30
days
and
includes
a
right
to
require
a
personal
interview.”
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
a
character
committee
as
well
as
an
examinations
committee
is
faced
at
least
it
seems
to
the
members
of
the
committee
where
it
very
honors
responsibility.
the
responsibility
of
telling
to
the
supreme
court
of
whatever
state
it
acts,
it
sits
in
that
this
particular
man
does
in
fact
or
this
particular
woman
does
in
fact
possess
not
only
the
learning
qualifications,
the
knowledge
of
the
law
but
also
possesses
the
character
which
can
be
safely
entrusted
with
the
many
responsibilities
and
privileges
and
prerogatives
which
do
attest
to
the
office
of
--
or
the
privilege
of
being
an
attorney.
now,
i’d
like
also
to
emphasize
to
the
court
so
that
this
question
of
due
process
and
this
question
of
arbitrary
treatment
is
put
the
rest
of
ours
in
the
state
of
arizona
is
concerned.
the
court
will
note,
and
i’m
reading
now
from
page
9
i’m
referring
now
to
page
9
of
this
pamphlet,
that
our
supreme
court
has
spelled
out
with
reasonable
meticulous
detail
what
must
be
done
before
the
committee
may
reject
and
what
it
must
do
if
it
does
reject
an
applicant.
the
rules
provide
for
two
types
of
proceedings,
the
informal
proceeding
and
a
formal
proceeding.
this
is
before
the
committee
in
considering
whether
an
applicant
should
be
recommended
for
admission
or
not.
if
the
record
upon
which
the
committee
is
going
to
act
is
one
which
has
been
supplied
by
the
applicant,
if
it
is
a
record
which
either
represents
what
he
has
said
and
has
filed
with
the
committee
and
what
is
on
the
face
of
the
record
what
the
committee
is
going
to
act
on.
the
committee
may
then
supplement
that
by
informal
conferences
with
the
applicant
but
the
rule
specifically
say
that
if
you’re
going
to
supplement
that
record
upon
which
you
are
going
to
deny
this
man
permission
to
practice,
you
must
do
it
in
writing
if
he
asks
for
it.
if
it
is
an
interview,
it
must
be
stenographic
to
report
an
interview.
it
must
be
filed
with
the
applicants
file.
the
rule
says,
if
you’re
going
to
deny
him
permission
or
not
deny
him,
i
beg
your
pardon,
if
you’re
going
to
recommend
against
his
admission,
you
then
must
put
a
writing
and
in
his
file
the
specific
reasons
why
you’re
denying
him,
you’re
recommending
against
his
admission
and
that
must
be
available
for
consideration
by
the
court.
in
other
words
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
may
i
come
to
that
moment
in
a
moment
shortly.
that
is
true
in
a
sense.
in
a
sense,
that
is
not
entirely
true.
i’ll
be
with
that
immediately.
the
rules
provide
that
we
may
not
permit
an
applicant
to
sit
for
a
bar
exam
but
for
many
years
by
a
tacit
approval
of
the
supreme
court
or
a
file
has
not
been
completely
clear,
an
applicant
is
permitted
conditionally
to
take
the
bar
exam.
an
applicant
signs
a
letter
stating
he
understand
or
she
understands
its
a
conditional
thing
and
that
if
the
file
is
not
clear,
the
grades
will
not
be
completed
and
the
applicant
will
not
be
recommended.
in
other
words,
with
a
six
months
log
if
you
have
a
small
tag
end
in
that
hasn’t
been
cleared
up,
if
you
have
as
in
this
case
it
would
appear
maybe
an
over
side
even.
you
don’t
deny
that
applicant
the
right
to
sit
for
the
bar
exam
and
say
you
got
a
wait
six
months
to
sit
again.
you
say
you
can
take
it
conditionally
upon
your
file
being
cleared
and
you
being
recommended
to
the
supreme
court
for
admission.
and
in
this
case
as
is
reflected
either
in
the
printed
record
or
on
the
record
which
has
come
up
from
the
arizona
supreme
court,
sara
baird
sat
conditionally
because
her
file
had
not
been
cleared.
now,
there
is
no
point
in
quibbling
about
it,
but
tentative
grading
of
sara
baird’s
papers
showed
she
did
a
good
job.
she’s
entitled
on
the
basis
of
the
tentative
examination
to
be
admitted
on
the
basis
of
her
learning
in
the
law.
the
committee
follows
her
practice
of
holding
a
formal
session
before
the
grades
are
released
and
clearing
all
files
and
if
they
are
not
cleared,
the
grades
are
not
finally
approved
and
the
applicant
is
not
recommended
to
the
supreme
court.
that
is
the
situation
we
have
here.
the
grades
have
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
mark
wilmer
i’m
not
--
i
could
not
answer
that.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
know
it
is
true,
your
honor
that
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
theoretically,
your
honor,
we
should
not
let
them
take
the
bar
examine
until
they
have
been
cleared.
theoretically,
under
the
rules
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
then
if
the
--
before
they
sit
for
the
bar
exam,
they
are
supposed
to
be
cleared.
before
an
applicant
is
permitted
to
sit,
the
right
to
bar
exam
under
our
rules,
that
applicant’s
file
should
be
cleared
and
prepared
--
the
committee
prepared
to
recommend
that
applicant
for
admission
to
the
supreme
court
if
they
pass
the
bar
exam.
but
in
other
states,
i
know
they
have
separate
committees
that
function.
i’m
not
really
familiar
enough
on
that,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
said
this,
your
honor,
that
because
of
the
fact
we
give
examinations
only
twice
a
year
that
the
committee
has
taken
the
prerogative
and
the
court
has
with
knowledge
of
it
has
made
the
objection
that
if
there
is
some
tag
end
of
the
file,
there
is
something
that
the
file
has
not
been
cleared
or
sometimes
the
nation
conference
is
slow
in
getting
back
their
reports.
the
applicant
is
permitted
to
right
to
bar
examination
conditionally,
that
condition
being
that
you’re
not
going
to
be
recommended
and
your
grades
are
not
going
to
be
finally
approved
unless
your
file
is
cleared
and
in
this
case,
the
file
was
not
cleared
because
this
one
question
wasn’t
answered.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i’m
not
really
sure
whether
that
is
an
accurate
statement,
your
honor,
it
should
be
“we
write
them
a
letter
and
say
we’re
going
to
let
you
take
it
conditionally
because
your
file
hasn’t
been
cleared.
but
if
your
file
is
not
cleared,
you’re
--
we’re
not
going
to
complete
processing
the
examination.
it’s
a
favor
to
the
applicant.
it
does
the
supreme
court
and
the
committee
no
good
because
we’ll
say
okay,
wait
for
another
six
months
and
so
little
basis
for
complain
of
that
being
arbitrary
action.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
there
is
your
honor.
might
i
just
say
one
other
thing
that
the
other
procedure
that
the
supreme
court
has
required
involves
were
there
is
not
in
the
record
the
basis
for
the
exclusion.
in
that
case,
a
formal
hearing
is
required.
the
applicant
is
permitted
to
have
a
full
examination
of
the
matters
that
are
involved
and
a
written
decision
must
be
made
by
the
committee
stating
the
facts
separately
on
the
basis
of
which
denial
of
the
committee
is
recommended.
now
answering
justice
harlan,
in
the
briefs
and
in
the
response
which
the
--
that’s
why
i
say
i’d
like
to
put
this
in
perspective.
cited
in
page
4
of
the
petitioner
writ
of
certiorari
and
repeated
and
the
other
this
comes
to
hand
readily.
this
is
the
response
the
committee
made
to
the
supreme
court
on
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
unless
we
are
to
conclude
that
one
who
truly
and
sincerely
believes
in
the
overthrow
of
the
united
states
governed
by
force
and
violence
is
also
qualified
to
practice
law
on
our
arizona
courts
then
an
answer
to
this
question
is
indeed
appropriate.
the
committee
again
emphasizes
that
a
mere
answer
of
“yes”
would
not
lead
to
an
automatic
rejection
of
the
applicant.
it
will
lead
to
an
investigation
and
interrogation
as
to
whether
or
not
the
applicant
presently
entertains
the
view
that
a
violent
overthrow
the
united
states
government
is
something
to
be
sought
after.
now
when
counsel
said,
we
are
looking
for
political
belief,
it
simply
not
the
case.
we’re
interested
in
finding
out
if
an
applicant
in
fact
believes
is
proper
to
take
exposed
it
into
a
courtroom.
if
it’s
proper
for
a
lawyer
to
rule
on
a
motion
of
a
present
overthrow
of
the
government,
that’s
what
we
are
after
here
and
we’re
entirely
indifferent
to
political
beliefs
in
the
sense
of
pure
political
beliefs
which
are
not
those
of
an
activists
and
of
the
political
beliefs
are
those
of
violence
and
they’re
the
beliefs
of
an
activists.
yes,
i
would
say
to
this
court,
we
would
reject
them
and
recommend
to
the
court
they
be
rejected.
if
the
answer
to
the
inquiry
was
“yes”
then
indeed,
no
i’m
sorry,
it
will
lead
to
an
investigation
and
interrogation
as
to
whether
or
not
the
applicant
presently
entertains
that
view
that
a
violent
overthrow
of
the
united
states
government
is
something
to
be
sought
after.
if
the
answer
to
this
inquiry
was
“yes”
then
indeed,
in
other
words,
that
they
are
in
favor
of
violent
to
overthrow
the
government
now,
we
would
reject
the
applicant
or
recommend
against
her
admission.
we
go
on
to
say
and
this
is
the
committee’s
official
position
in
this
matter.
i
believe
that
mrs.
baird
should
realize
that
even
though
she
answered
the
question,
that
she
had
one
time
been
a
communist
or
had
otherwise
been
an
associate
with
organizations
not
regard
as
friend
of
the
united
states
government,
then
we
would
not,
that’s
--
that
would
not
necessarily
call
as
to
reject
her
application.
we
would
undoubtedly
going
to
ask
her
some
questions
as
to
her
present
beliefs
and
as
to
other
matter
to
which
would
bear
upon
the
effect
on
such
membership
would
have
upon
her
qualifications
to
practice
law.
the
committee
would
again
emphasize
to
this
court
that
if
the
answer
to
question
27
is
“yes”
the
committee
will
then
endeavor
to
ascertain
if
sara
baird
does
adhere
to
the
view
that
the
overthrow
of
the
united
states
government
of
this
state
and
of
the
united
states
by
force
and
violence
would
be
a
desirable
objective,
and
that
she
would
expect
to
actively
support
such
views.
now,
it
seems
to
me
if
it
please
the
court,
that
this
is
sufficient
to
put
this
case
in
a
posture,
in
a
clear
context
to
what
is
really
involved
in
this
case.
the
committee
has
no
resources.
it
depends
upon
what
is
brought
to
its
attention.
it
can
only
inquire
by
way
of
interrogation
such
as
this
and
trying
to
reach
some
conclusion.
when
an
applicant
refuses
to
answer
a
question,
an
applicant
who
is
asking
for
a
recommendation
certifying
to
their
integrity
and
honesty
and
ability
to
practice
law
and
their
willingness
to
uphold
institution
to
this
country
in
so
far
as
the
practice
requires,
certainly
the
committee
is
not
in
the
position
to
sign
their
name
for
certification
of
this
particular
applicant
is
prepared
to
and
should
be
admitted
to
practice
law.
and
that’s
what
is
the
issue
in
this
case,
it’s
whether
or
not
a
committee
should
be
required
to
certify
to
something
which
they
don’t
know
is
true
or
not.
and
which
goes
to
the
very
heart
at
least,
we
think
of
the
soundest
of
our
judicial
system
and
its
future
usage
in
this
country.
now,
if
i
may
be
excuse
for
having
raised
my
voice,
i
will
proceed.
the
whole
matter
here,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
us
is
that
the
requirements
which
counsel
says
we
have
rejected
and
counsel
says
we
are
ignoring
of
seeking
after
political
beliefs,
of
seeking
after
what
does
this
particular
applicant
think
about
is
wholly
outside
of
an
alley
in
this
record.
a
committee
can
only
bring
in
an
applicant
and
say
now,
what
do
you
believe
about
this
and
then
you
have
to
make
a
judgment
factors.
are
they
telling
the
truth
or
not?
do
you
think
it
is
a
good
idea
to
carry
for
exposures
to
be
carried
into
the
courtroom,
to
carry
into
the
united
states
congress
chambers?
what
do
you
think
about
these
things?
many
other
questions
and
you
finally
come
to
conclusion
that
either
this
is
someone
who
simply,
ideologically
entertains
certain
views
you
don’t
believe
in,
and
that
is
none
of
our
business.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
right.
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
correct,
unless
something
else
shapes
up
in
the
answers,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
these
files
are
read
carefully
to
see
if
there
are
any
caveats
that
should
be
ceased
upon
and
pursued.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
suspect
in
this
case,
your
honor,
it
would
have
been
ignored
and
the
file
would
have
been
closed
and
the
applicant
would
have
been
approved.
in
other
words
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
nothing
else.
i
may
be
very
frank
with
the
court.
nothing
else
in
the
file
indicated
anything
wrong.
nothing
else
in
the
file
indicated
there’s
anything
wrong
with
this
lady,
that
she
had
any
bad
background
that
she
had
been
belong
to
organizations
that
were
wrong
or
anything
else,
or
that
wrong
in
the
sense
of
being
what
we
would
have
at
least
think
of
a
subversive
or
activists
against
the
best
interest
of
the
country.
so
that
if
she’d
answered,
not
applic
--
if
she’d
answered
“i
don’t
know
of
any
organizations”,
that’s
acceptable.
we
have
no
right
to
have
her
go
out
and
make
any
search
and
investigation
to
determine
what
or
shall
of
these
things
means
that
she
said
that
she
belong
to.
this
one
other
thing
i
meant
to
bring
to
your
court’s
attention
before
i
pass
on
this
one,
the
thing
is
the
committee’s
attention.
the
further
portion
of
her
response
that
were
made
in
the
supreme
court
that
if
this
is
the
conclusion
reached
by
the
committee,
that
is
that
she
is
an
activist
in
the
sense
of
believing
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence,
it
will
undoubtedly
refuse
to
recommend
sara
baird
for
admission
to
the
bar
of
arizona.
now,
should
the
conclusion
be
that
her
membership
is
of
a
nominal
character
and
that
she
does
not
participate
and
adhere
to
the
views
that
a
violent
overthrow
of
our
government
our
desirable,
then
the
committee
would
have
no
legal
basis
for
refusing
to
recommend
her
for
admission.
now,
that
is
the
position
of
this
committee
before
the
supreme
court
of
arizona.
it’s
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
i’m
reading
from
our
response
to
the
order
to
show
your
cause,
your
honor,
in
arizona
supreme
court.
that
is
found
in
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
as
filed
by
the
petitioner
here
and
i
was
reading
from
page
5
of
that
petition.
mr.
mark
wilmer
she
was
never
interrogated,
your
honor.
in
other
words
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
the
questionnaire
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
was
the
question
she
said
“not
applicable.”
mr.
mark
wilmer
that’s
the
question
she
said
“not
applicable.”
so
the
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
she
had
answered
the
organizations,
your
honor.
we
had
really
no
right
to
ask
her
this
27
question,
lest
do
you
belong
to
a
communist
party
because
we
had
already
ask
her
to
list
all
the
organizations
to
which
you
have
been
a
member.
mr.
mark
wilmer
so
theoretically,
at
least
she
had
answered
that
question
and
the
only
question
she
refused
to
answer
was,
“do
you
belong
to
or
have
you
belong
to
an
organization
which
believes
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
united
states
by
force
and
violence?”
mr.
mark
wilmer
no,
your
honor.
i’ve
said
that,
had
she
--
had
we
pursued
the
matter,
had
mrs.
baird
said
“yes,
i
do
believe”
or
“yes,
i
do
belong
to
organizations”
then
she
would
have
been
asked
to
appear
before
the
committee,
two
or
three
members
of
the
committee
and
would
have
been
ask
questions
about
what
in
fact
do
you
believe.
do
you
believe
in
overthrowing
it
now?
are
you
in
a
position?
mr.
mark
wilmer
that’s
what
we
would
have
done.
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
never
got
the
chance,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
never
got
the
chance.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
i
can
see,
your
honor,
we
might
have
done
this.
the
questionnaire,
however,
is
one
that’s
been
used
for
so
many,
many
years.
we
might
have
said,
“do
you
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government?”
mr.
mark
wilmer
pardon?
mr.
mark
wilmer
no.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
right.
right.
that
is
right,
your
honor
and
the
entire
purpose
of
that
question
if
the
answer
is
“yes”
is
to
then
give
us
a
lead
to
interrogate
the
applicant
as
to
what
in
fact
are
your
present
feelings
and
beliefs
and
intentions
with
respect
to
overthrow
of
the
government
by
violence.
that
is
intended
to
trigger
the
committee,
it
was
a
cover
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor,
if
i
had
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor,
i
concede
that
that
might
have
been
a
more
directive
approach
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
oh,
your
honor,
i
can’t
do
--
we
can’t
do
this
over
again.
this
is
history.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
ask
the
question,
“did
the
applicant
belong
to
or
had
the
applicant
belong
to
organizations
which
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence?”
that
question
was
answered
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
would
say
that
unquestionably
the
applicant
could
have
said
i
do
not
know,
i
cannot
tell
you
and
we
might
have
asked
her
what
do
you
belong
to.
but
it
doesn’t
seem
to
me
that
the
thrust
of
the
question,
your
honor,
is
directed
to
more
than
asking
the
applicant
to
put
on
the
record
what
her
background
is
or
what
his
background
is?
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
problem
the
committee
--
a
committee
faces
is
this.
you
are
only
able
to
do
so
much
investigation.
you
ask
questions
that
you
think
will
point
up
to
you
where
you
should
pursue
the
matter
further.
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
in
view
of
your
honor’s
suggestions,
i
think
probably
the
questionnaire
should
be
amended.
perhaps,
maybe
it’s
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
but
that
isn’t
the
questionnaire
we
have
here.
that
is
not
the
question
that
was
asked.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
i’m
simply
saying,
your
honor,
that
one
of
the
many
things
we
would
want
to
know
under
those
circumstances
would
be
that
question
but
what
i’m
trying
to
emphasize
is
that
if
there
is
something
in
the
file
which
leads
the
committee
to
believe
that
there
is
a
defect
in
the
character
of
the
applicant,
then
the
committee
ask
the
applicant
to
come
in
for
an
oral
interview
and
the
interview
is
stenographically
reported
and
made
a
part
of
the
record.
and
if
the
committee
does
any
action
based
upon
that
interview,
it
must
be
part
of
the
record
so
that
in
the
course
of
an
interview,
the
question
i
pose
here,
your
honor,
i
suggest
that
would
probably
have
been
asked
the
applicant
and
you
would
have
been
given
an
opportunity
to
deny
that
she
had
any
activist
feuds.
and
even
if
she
had
said
“yes”
and
if
she
had
come
in
and
showed
the
committee
that
she
didn’t
believe
in
the
present
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence,
that
she
would
not
participate,
she
didn’t
intend
to
participate
in
that.
if
her
views
were
those
simply
like
i
belong
to
the
altar
(ph),
i
belong
to
this,
i
belong
to
that.
i
don’t
really
know
what
they
stand
for.
the
committee
would
have
said,
“fine,
you’re
admitted.
you’re
recommended
for
admission.”
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
your
honor,
i
recognize
the
criticism
of
the
court
and
i
think
it’s
something
that
should
be
considered
but
unfortunately
this
case
can’t
be
run
be
backward
like
you
do
a
replay
on
a
football
game.
this
has
been
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
are
trying
to
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
but
your
honor,
if
you’re
going
to
certify
to
our
supreme
court
that
this
particular
applicant
is
qualified
mentally,
morally
and
by
character,
we
have
to
have
the
range
of
a
large
number
of
questions,
otherwise
it
is
impossible
to
make
such
a
certification
if
you
can
ask
these
questions
of
a
person
who
wants
the
privilege
of
practicing
law.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
did
not
come
here
citing
that
case
and
sitting
down,
your
honor,
i
attempted
to
make
an
argument.
i
would
simply
say
that
it
seems
all
of
these
arguments
that
have
been
made,
all
of
these
nice
distinctions
attempted
to
be
drawn
comes
squarely
within
the
rule
of
this
court
as
repeated
so
often
that
it’s
almost
like
saying
the
“holy
mary”
or
the
“our
father”
to
a
catholic.
the
question
is
simply
is
where
you
have
an
interplay
of
first
amendment
rights
and
of
a
personal
claim
such
as
this
lady
presents.
it
then
thus
become
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
state’s
rights,
the
overwhelmingly
needs
of
the
state
are
such
as
to
require
a
little,
tiny
answer
we
want
from
this
witness.
in
other
words,
whether
or
not,
the
right
of
the
state
to
ascertain
if
the
character
of
a
person
who
wants
to
be
admitted
to
practice
law
is
such,
they
should
be
admitted
is
of
sufficient
importance
to
entrust,
to
require
to
that
particular
person
make
a
disclosure
of
their
true
beliefs
and
positions
and
expectations
if
they
are
permitted
to
practice
law.
we
think
the
answer
should
be
that
in
fact
the
state
does
have
that
right
and
whatever
minor,
as
they
say,
that
advice
to
the
minor
exposures
required
by
this
question
is
a
very
small
price
for
the
applicant
to
pay
who
seeks
the
privilege
of
a
practicing
attorney
in
the
courts
of
the
state
and
who
should
assume
a
responsibilities
is
that
you
go
with
that.
now,
i’ll
just
say
one
thing
in
closing.
i
realize
that
an
answer
to
this
question
is
not
going
to
do
very
much
the
way
of
catching
anybody.
but
i
do
say
that
for
this
court
to
say
to
the
young
law
students
of
our
country
for
this
court
to
declare
by
formal
opinion
that
an
inquiry
as
to
whether
the
beliefs
of
those
law
students,
their
beliefs
are
such
that
they
are
permitted
to
espouse
a
belief
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
violence,
the
fact
that
this
court
was
willing
to
say
that
we
don’t
consider
of
enough
importance
what
you
believe
in
this
respect,
what
you’re
actually
are
thinking
in
this
respect
to
permit
the
committee
to
inquire
of
it,
it
seems
to
me
would
indeed
be
an
invitation
to
the
young
law
students.
to
think
the
practice
of
law
really
is
pretty
much
something
like
as
exemplified
in
some
of
our
recent
court
trials.
mr.
mark
wilmer
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
at
the
outset
it
might
be
appropriate
and
go
serviceable
to
the
court,
if
we
would
first
put
in
proper
relationship,
proper
context
the
record
in
the
court
below.
i
would
say
at
the
outset
that
the
position
of
the
respondent
is
not
one
of
an
advocate
either
way
so
far
as
this
question
of
finality
is
concerned.
as
we
review
our
responsibility
here
to
simply
to
bring
to
the
court
the
facts
with
respect
to
this
question
and
then
proceed
on
to
as
best
we
can
explain
the
other
proceedings
in
the
court
below.
i
think
the
best
way
to
put
the
record
in
proper
relationship
to
the
actual
facts
is
perhaps
to
begin
with
the
response
which
was
filed
by
the
committee
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona.
now,
it
is
my
understanding
from
reading
rules
of
this
court
that
papers
that
are
certified
by
the
clerk
of
the
lower
court
are
part
of
the
record
and
subject
to
being
considered
in
this
case.
i
say
that
for
this
reason
that
the
appendix
which
is
part
of
the
petitioners
filing
with
this
court
excerpts
from
the
committee's
response
to
our
supreme
court,
certain
portions
of
that
response,
necessarily
when
this
matter
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
committee,
the
full
impact,
the
full
exposure
of
this
case
in
this
court,
was
not
readily
understood,
and
accordingly
we
did
not
enlarge
upon
the
printed
portions
of
the
response
of
the
arizona
committee
on
examinations
to
the
arizona
supreme
court.
the
original,
however,
is
in
the
record
and
i
would
like
briefly
to
refer
to
that
with
the
court's
permission.
i
say
that
for
this
reason
that
we
have
indicated
our
position
as
one
of
simply
here
are
the
facts
we
made
us
on
the
citing
of
the
case
now
as
any
other
time
if
in
fact
this
court
has
jurisdiction.
the
court
will
recall
that
it
has
been
brought
to
the
court's
attention
that
the
proceeding
in
the
arizona
supreme
court
was
initiated
by
a
petition
for
an
order
to
show
cause,
directed
to
the
committee
on
examinations
and
admissions.
and
referring
to
the
appendix
before
i
move
on,
the
prayer
of
that
petition
read
as
follows,
the
arizona
supreme
court,
“wherefore
your
petitioners
pray
that
this
court
make
another
its
order
requiring
the
committee
on
examinations
and
admissions
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona
be
in
appear
before
this
court
of
at
to
date
at
a
time
certain
then
an
order
to
show
cause,
if
any
it
may
have,
quite
petitioner
should
not
be
forth
with
recommended
for
admission
by
the
state
to
the
state
bar
or
in
the
alternative
show
cause
like
petitioner's
applications
should
not
be
processed
by
the
committee
without
requiring
the
petitioner,
any
further
answer
--
of
petitioner
any
further
answer
to
the
question
27
of
applicant's
questionnaire
and
affidavit.”
the
court
would
recall
this
is
a
question
which
asked,
“have
you
ever
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
any
organizations
which
supports
the
overthrowing
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
and
violence?”
the
opening
portion
on
the
memorandum
which
the
committee
filed
with
the
arizona
supreme
court
reads
as
follows:
“applicant
in
a
main
treats
the
posture
of
our
application
to
the
committee
as
rejected
by
the
committee,
and
from
this
false
premise
enlarges
upon
a
proposed
constitutional
rights
of
the
applicant.
nothing
could
be
chored
from
the
true
fact.”
mr.
mark
wilmer
i'm
reading
your
honor
and
then
i'm
sorry
this
is
not
in
the
printed
appendix,
your
honor.
it
is
in
the
original
of
the
respond
certified
by
the
clerk
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
to
this
court.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
your
honor,
i
must
say
it
frankly,
i
didn't
suppose
it
would
be
needed
at
the
time
when
i
read
the
appendix
as
certified.
in
other
words,
we
did
not
have
a
complete
view
of
the
flow
of
the
case
in
this
court
as
to
what
or
would
not
be
material.
because
i
read
your
rules
and
i
assume
i
am
correct.
even
though
it
is
not
printed
in
the
appendix,
nonetheless
say
for
this
part
of
the
certified
record,
it
may
be
referred
to
before
this
court.
of
course
if
that
is
not
true,
i
should
not
do
so.
mr.
mark
wilmer
it
should
be,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
this
would
be
the
responds
of
the
committee
to
the
petitioner's
order
to
show
cause
and
may
i
please
the
court
in
this
arizona
supreme
court.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes
your
honor,
i'm
sure.
i'm
sorry
i
have
finally
realized
the
moment
(inaudible).
that
is
if
it
would
have
been
a
better
applicant
in
the
main
treats
the
posture
of
our
application
to
the
committee
as
rejected
by
the
committee
and
from
this
fault's
premise
enlarges
upon
the
supposed
in
constitutional
rights
of
the
applicant.
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
true
fact
as
this
appears
from
the
letter
of
april
24,
1968
attached
to
the
affidavit
of
robert
a.
gellin
where
the
court
will
recall
this
chief
counsel
for
a
petitioner.
the
committee
has
not
rejected
the
application
of
sarah
baird
and
does
not
intend
to
do
so,
unless
and
until
further
facts
appear
which
would
warrant
this
rejection.
i
would
say
in
this
context,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
this
letter
of
robert
--
to
mr.
robert
a.
gellin
and
antedated
the
application
of
the
petitioner
for
an
order
to
show
cause
to
the
arizona
supreme
court.
in
other
words,
this
was
the
discussion
of
counsel
prior
to
the
initiation
of
this
proceeding.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
her
application,
your
honor,
which
still
as
it
is
today
sitting
on
our
shelves
waiting
for
her
to
either
move
her
mandamuses
to
complete
the
processing
of
it
or
something
else
would
have
happen.
in
our
position
of
that
may
i
say
this
briefly
your
honor.
the
committee
on
examinations
and
admissions
is
a
criterion
hand
made
of
the
arizona
supreme
court.
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
have
no
authority
other
than
that
which
the
court
gives
us
and
i
might
say
if
it
should
become
of
consequence,
the
entire
rules
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
that
are
in
volume
i
believe
it
is
17
of
west
publishing
companies
of
arizona
revised
statues.
they
govern,
they
limit,
they
set
to
the
extent
of
our
authority.
we
have
no
inherent
authority
or
any
kind,
the
rights
other
than
oath
givens
by
the
rules.
therefore,
when
the
court
says
to
us,
ask
these
questions
and
they're
set
out
verbatim
and
this
is
one
of
them.
get
the
answers
from
them
and
then
you
proceed
to
certify
to
this
court
your
opinion.
we
have
no
choice
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
we
are
stymied.
we
cannot
reject
it
much
more
as
we
could
if
we
want
to
be
arbitrary,
perhaps
we
should.
i
don't
know
but
the
facts
are
that
in
less
and
until
that
question
is
answered
or
someone
tells
us
that
we
most
do
something
else
that
case
with
that
matter
we'll
say
it
as
it
is.
mr.
mark
wilmer
only
to
this
extents,
your
honor.
the
committee
has
no
authority
one
way
or
the
other
to
admit
or
reject
anyone.
we
merely
make
a
recommendation
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
does
the
admission,
does
the
rejection.
i
would
say
this
if
it
may
please
the
court
that
justice
harlan
by
interaction
between
the
rule
and
the
committee's
action
for
practical
purposes,
i
would
conceive
that
mrs.
baird
is
for
the
moment
at
least
effectively
stymied.
now,
whether
she
should
bring
a
mandamus
and
in
that
faction
call
upon
the
arizona
supreme
court
to
make
an
effective
ruling
that
is
not
automated
within
our
providence.
i
would
simply
say
that
as
are
the
moment
at
least,
the
arizona
supreme
court
has
been
told
by
the
committee.
we
haven't
made
our
decision.
we
are
unable
to
make
a
decision
and
therefore
we
submit
the
matters
as
it
is
and
the
court
simply
said,
“well
we
deny
the
petition,
you
should
complete
due
process
in
this
petition.”
now,
whether
that
amounts
to
finality
or
not
within
the
rule
of
this
court,
i
don't
know,
i
express
the
opinion
as
to
it,
i
simply
bring
it
to
the
court's
attention.
i
might
say
though
for
the
purpose
of
my
next
statement
to
the
court
that
this
letter
of
april
24,
1968
which
antedated
the
beginning
of
this
proceeding
to
mr.
allen
as
chief
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
i
believe
has
some
of
validity
and
some
value
in
determining
what
in
effect,
what
in
fact
i
should
say
is
the
actual
position
of
the
committee
in
the
court
below
and
the
committee
here.
this
letter
said,
i
also
believe,
that
mrs.
baird
should
realize
that
even
though
she
answered
the
question,
“did
she
had
at
one
time
been
communist
or
had
had
otherwise
been
associated
with
the
organizations
not
regarded
as
friendly
to
the
united
states
government?”
this
would
not
necessarily
cause
us
to
reject
her
application.
we
would
undoubtly
want
to
ask
you
some
questions
as
to
her
present
beliefs
and
as
to
the
other
matters
which
would
bear
upon
the
effect
of
such
membership
would
have
are
their
qualification
to
practice
law.
the
committee
is
aware
that
under
presence
of
supreme
court
decisions,
mere
membership
in
an
organization
is
not
sufficient
necessarily
to
disqualify
rank
and
positions
of
responsibility
and
this
would
be
the
added
through
the
committee
in
this
matter.
now,
i
say
that
for
this
position
for
this
reason
if
it
please
the
court.
we
have
had
here
what
i
would
term
some
rather
fancy
steps
down
the
sidelines,
so
to
speak,
of
what
words
mean.
i
believe
that
as
we
proceed,
we'll
find
the
committee
made
it
an
unequivocally
and
plainly
apparent
to
mrs.
baird.
we
were
not
concern
with
what
her
beliefs
were
such.
we
are
not
concerned
with
looking
inside
her
heart
to
see
what
she
believe
or
didn't
believe
in.
we
were
concerned
with
finding
out
did
she
have
the
qualification
which
should
make
her
a
lawyer,
which
would
justify
us
in
certifying
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
that
in
fact
she
would
be
a
lawyer
that
the
court
would
be
proud
of
having
admitted.
now,
a
fair
reading,
i
believe
if
it
please
the
court
of
the
committee's
a
letter
to
mr.
allen.
the
committee's
response
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
have
our
response
here
indicates
simply
one
thing
whether
we
use
the
word
"belief"
or
whether
we
use
the
word
"view"1
or
whatever
word
we
use.
we
are
concerned
with
one
thing.
i
heard
yesterday
the
questioned
ask
if
mr.
baird
would
prefer
the
question
he
presented
here
whether
the
record
he's
made
in
the
court
below
or
here.
and
i
believe
he
said
here.
i
have
to
confess
surprise.
i
wrote
them
both
and
i
really
didn't
think
i
was
saying
anything
different
one
time
than
the
other.
i
thought
we
were
saying
to
the
court
below
and
the
thought
we're
saying
to
this
court
that
if
mrs.
baird
believes
in
the
sense
that
she
would
actively
advocate
and
assist
and
advance
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
the
states
of
arizona
by
force
and
violence,
we
want
no
pardon
nor
will
we
recommend
her
for
admission
to
our
arizona
supreme
court
unless
and
until
we
are
told
to
do
so
by
some
higher
authority.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
right.
mr.
mark
wilmer
below?
your
honor,
i
meant
by
that
that
she
was
prepared
to
go
out
and
walk
up
and
down
the
streets
and
take
other
step
necessary
to
advance.
mr.
mark
wilmer
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
advocating
the
government
--
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence?
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
would
say
if
it
please
the
court
that
number
one
that
that
would
contravene
the
canon
of
ethics,
which
said
you
shall
do
nothing
to
bring
at
disrepute
the
profession
of
the
law
or
the
court.
therefore,
i
would
say
that
if
mrs.
baird
said,
i
propose
to
walk
up
and
down
the
streets
out
for
--
i'm
admitted
as
a
lawyer
and
proclaiming
to
the
world
that
i
a
lawyer
believed
we
should
blow
up
the
capital,
assassinate
public
officials
and
otherwise
change
that
form
of
this
government
by
force
we
want
no
pardon
of
her
unless
we're
told
we
must
let
her
in.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
don't
like
which
one?
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
would
have
no
problem
with
that
at
all.
i
think
that's
her
privilege.
that's
her
privilege.
mr.
mark
wilmer
the
line
that
i
draw
your
honor
is
when
you
talk
about
destruction
of
this
government
by
force
and
violence.
mr.
mark
wilmer
pardon.
mr.
mark
wilmer
the
committee's
position
your
honor
was
not
just
a
belief.
your
committee,
the
committee's
position
was
actively
accept
and
actively
advanced
that
philosophy
and
that
solution.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
certainly.
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
couldn't
care
a
less
what
are
beliefs
are
in
any
field
except
that
which
endangers
directly
upon
the
validity
and
the
utility
of
her
service
as
a
lawyer
as
to
those
matters
we
are
concerned
and
we're
critically
concerned.
now,
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
would
say
your
(voice
overlap)
the
occasion
is
right,
you
would
do
it,
yes
and
i
don't
believe
that
person
should
be
a
lawyer.
mr.
mark
wilmer
they
would
have
been
incorporated
in
the
questions
asked.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
our
rules
provide
your
honor
that
in
making
its
investigation,
the
committee
can
conduct
an
informal
or
formal
investigation.
it
can
interrogate
a
witness
in
formally
with
the
understanding
that
if
that
interrogation
is
to
be
made
a
part
of
the
decision,
it
must
then
to
conform
or
it
must
go
on
record
but
i
have
tried
to
say
numerous
times,
we
would
simply
call
mrs.
baird
and
say,
“look
what
do
you
really
believe
about
this?
do
you?
are
you
prepared
if
you're
admitted
to
practice
should
a
crisis
arrive
that
the
government
is
threaten
with
violence,
are
your
hands
completely
free
and
are
you
as
a
citizen
completely
able
to
stand
behind
the
forces
of
government
which
you
firmly
uphold
when
you
become
a
lawyer?
or
that
point
will
you
retire
and
negate
the
oath
which
you
took?
mr.
mark
wilmer
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor,
i
can't
answer
that
that
other
than
to
say
has
been
there
for
at
least
10
years
to
my
knowledge
and
i
would
assume
many
years
prior
to
that.
i
think
it
is
not
an
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
pardon.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no,
as
far
as
i
know
your
honor.
the
rules
as
they
now
--
that
is
these
rules
as
they
now
stand
are
those
that
probably
i
answered
four
years
ago
but
i
can't
swear
to
that,
i
don't
remember.
it's
been
a
long
time,
we'll
put
it
that
way.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
if
he
has
a
usual
question
whether
not
they
have
been
involved
in
fraud
whether
or
not
they
have
been
bonded
and
if
such,
there
had
a
bond
claim
it
against
him
and
have
they
been
involved
in
any
criminal
actions?
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes.
yes,
i'm
sure
we're
not
going
to
say
you
refuse
to
tell
us
if
you
stole
money
somewhere
so
we're
going
to
admit
you
anyway.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
can
say
this
in
all
honestly,
your
honor,
we've
admitted
people
at
their
younger
age
have
been
guilty
of
burglary,
statutory
rape
or
what
have
she
questioned
have
been
rehabilitated?
do
they
now
measure
up
to
the
standards
of
who
or
what
a
person
should
be
or
appear
she
desires
to
be
a
lawyer?
mr.
mark
wilmer
to
27?
mr.
mark
wilmer
no,
it
would
not
bar
her.
no,
no,
no
your
honor.
it
would
not.
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
would
then
endeavor
to
find
out
how
deep
did
that
belief
lie.
and
if
it
lay
on
the
surface
and
then
simply
a
childish
thing,
a
passing
fancy
that's
one
thing.
if
it
descended
to
the
depths
of
an
embedded
truth,
fanatical,
getting
the
government
should
be
destroyed.
i
therefore
then
feel
it
that
person
should
not
be
admitted
to
practice
law.
now,
i
would
like
to
simply
say
then
your
honor
that
we
are
told
that
this
belief
that
mrs.
berg
talks
about
is
a
political
belief,
it's
a
political
matter,
its
something
which
is
protected
by
the
decision
of
this
court.
therefore,
we
should
not
be
permitted
to
inquire
under
thought
processes
connection
with
it.
i
find
it
difficult,
if
it
please
the
court,
to
believe
that
the
notion
of
a
bomb
dropped
at
the
appropriate
time
in
17
different
places
in
the
united
states
and
then
attempt
to
take
over
the
government
is
a
political
matter
and
that
is
what
i
read
into
the
notion
of
overthrowing
this
government
by
force
and
violence.
1i
do
not
read
into
the
notion
of
assassination
of
public
officials,
members
of
the
congress
or
other
persons
which
in
positions
of
authority
for
the
bad
purpose.
i
do
not
read
that
as
a
political
activity
or
as
a
political
belief
which
is
subject
to
protection.
some
years
back,
unfortunately
we
had
i
suppose
what
was
then
considered
a
form
of
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
western
states
and
unfortunately
in
other
places
commonly
known
as
necktie
parties.
but
all
of
these
are
true
that
when
that
unfortunate
individual
was
strung
up
who
is
suspected
of
having
been
a
rapist,
suspected
of
having
been
a
murderer
or
whatever
capital
thief,
whatever
you
want
to
term
it.
i
suspect
that
you
might
turn
not
the
administration
of
justice
but
i
don't
believe
that
you
would
term
that
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
sense
that
we
are
speaking
of
the
administration
of
justice
today
and
by
like
talking,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
notion
of
violence,
a
violent
overthrow
the
government
of
this
country
for
the
very
purpose
of
destroying
it
as
a
political
belief,
if
so
on
smarter
than
i
will
have
to
convince
the
other.
now,
i
should
deal
briefly
if
it
please
the
court
to
this
public
versus
--
spevack
versus
klein
which
is
of
course
the
--
probably
the
case
that
expand
many
of
these
things
that
are
now
coming
to
life.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
mark
wilmer
incrimination?
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
would
not
raise
the
point
that
it
was
not
--
that
is
was
not
adequately
raised
your
honor.
i
would
not
raise
that
because
i
think
at
least
we
were
unnoticed
to
the
fact
that
she
deserves
that.
mr.
mark
wilmer
the
answer
to
the
question
as
given
on
the,
in
their,
on
the
affidavit
was
not
applicable.
i
frankly
do
not
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
i
would
have
to
say
your
honor
my
recollection
is
that
probably
it
was
raised.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes
i
would
say
it.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
think
it
was
mr.
baird,
i'm
sure
i
can
qualify
my
answer
one
where
the
other
be
but
my
recollection
inside
in
this
discussion
with
mr.
allen
and
in
related
matters
that
at
least
to
put
the
point
we'd
brought
up
that
this
amounted
to
incrimination.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
your
honor
the
problem
with
that
year
that
there's
the
brief,
relatively
brief
petition
filed.
the
relatively
brief
response
with
the
memorandum
and
the
argument
was
not
reported.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes.
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor,
i
have
to
confess,
which
i
don't
know.
if
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
with
the
file
but
i
don't
have
a
sharp
enough
recollection
at
the
moment
to
answer
your
honor
and
be
of
service
to
you.
i
would
simply
say
with
respect
to
the
klein
case
which
of
course
says
that
the
lawyer
may
not
be
disbarred
for
refusing
to
answer
the
question
that
is
relative
at
the
fifth
amendment?
i
think
that
that
case
is
not
readily
distinguishable.
i
would
be
little
optimistic
to
say
that
but
i
would
say
it
is
distinguishable
and
i
think
it
is
distinguishable
on
adequate
grounds
and
that
is
the
fifth
amendment
situation,
if
it
please
you,
mr.
justice
white.
i
don't
like
to
use
this
illustration
but
i
can't
think
of
none
more
apt
and
that
is
this.
in
arizona
and
massachusetts
and
florida
and
washington,
they
have
what
is
called
dog
race
and
in
that
particular
activity
which
is
per
mutual
betting
situation.
dogs
that
have
never
run
are
what
are
called
schooled.
in
other
words
they
are
run
through
the
race
as
if
it
was
a
race.
there
time
is
recorded,
the
whole
thing
is
recorded
just
like
any
race
track
in
which
way
with
desire
to
know
about
any
dog
or
horse.
and
based
on
that
when
they
do
start
running
they
are
(inaudible).
well,
now
the
reason
that
is
you
has
a
track
record.
you
have
something
to
go
over
and
those
that
have
been
on
the
track
and
have
run
have
already
established
themselves
and
i
say
therefore
that
when
someone
comes
who
has
not
have
a
track
record
as
to
we
have
no
background,
then
rightfully
a
different
rule
should
apply
than
from
a
lawyer
who
has
been
admitted
to
practice
which
established
his
reputation
or
his
ability
relative
to
practice,
who
has
in
all
things
carry
himself
such
at
the
bar
may
property
criticized.
and
then
therefore,
i
say
that
when
we
say
that
a
lawyer
who
has
been
admitted
to
practice
who
is
a
practicing
lawyer
should
be
permitted
to
take
the
fifth
amendment,
i
would
readily
distinguish
that
from
the
applicant
who
is
a
raw
product,
if
i
may
use
that,
that
expression,
whose
qualifications,
whose
future,
whose
ability
is
unknown
that
then
we
must
judge
and
therefore
we
are
entitled
to
ask
many
questions,
we
probably
should
not
and
could
not
answer
at
admitted
lawyer.
i
would
just
say
and
closely
if
it
please
the
court
that
there
are
some
very
sound
reasons
for
the
formality
of
this
affidavit
and
the
application.
i
realized
it
is
perhaps
since
burdens
at
some
of
the
outset
but
without
attempting
if
it
please
the
court
to
appear
critical
of
our
law
schools.
i
think
one
of
the
biggest
problems
that
is
met
by
the
bar
today
and
by
the
administrative
committee
is
a
complete
default
in
many
of
the
law
schools
of
any
attempt
to
teach
ethics
at
all,
of
any
attempt
to
teach
professional
responsibility
and
it
is
only
when
we
bring
these
young
people
up
short
against
an
application
which
indicates,
this
is
a
mighty
important
thing.
this
is
a
type
of
practice
that
is
very,
very
important
that
all
these
things
declared
before
you
may
practice.
we
think
that
tends
to
bring
to
their
mind
and
perhaps
the
consciousness
of
the
importance
of
this.
i
might
just
say
it
in
one
more
other
thing.
seven
or
eight
years
ago,
ohio
supreme
court
at
the
committees
request,
adopted
a
rule
that
says
you
can't
be
admitted
to
practice
until
you
pass
the
examination
of
professional
ethics.
you
can't
be
admitted
until
you
have
passed
that
examination.
i
will
say
this
that
we
no
longer
have
applicant
who
spell
canons
of
ethics,
c-a-n-n-o-n-s
then
i
can
spell
up.
we
do
not
catch
anyone
on
the
basis
of
that
requirement.
we
teach
them
how
the
lawyers,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
this
is
an
important
profession
and
that
ethics
is
probably
the
most
important
part
of
it
and
therefore
this
type
of
an
application,
we
feel,
is
highly
important
as
bringing
ho1me
to
the
extent
we
can
to
the
applicant,
this
is
a
mighty
important
thing
you're
going
into.
this
was
a
very,
very
serious
thing
that
you're
going
into.
these
questions
are
necessary
because
unless
you
live
a
road
of
spotless
life
you
don't
belong
in
our
profession.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no,
but
i
think
perhaps
that
this
might
be
an
indication
we
should
your
honor.
i
like
to
say
these
are
old,
old
questions
and
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
i'm
not
at
all
here
defending
them.
i'm
simply
here
saying
that
these
are
what
we
lived
with.
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor,
they
are
both
the
management
if
they're
now
and
raising
the
question
of
residency
as
being
a
right
or
any
residency
in
the
light
of
a
shapiro
case.
we're
now
having
a
span
of
objections
to
any
requirement
of
residency
because
of
shapiro
case.
so,
that
for
that
as
to
this
one
question
they
seem
to
have
become
reconciled
answer.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no,
your
honor
but
i
would
not
make
a
point
of
that
because
my
recollection
is
at
mrs.
braid
did
answered,
if
she
haven't
been
sure
we
wouldn't
made
a
point
of
it.
i
cannot
recall
in
detail
what
her
answer
was
but
i
know
it
satisfied
us
or
we
would
have
or
should
have
been
but
of
my
recollection
is
she
did
list
quite
a
number
for
organizations
but
it
is
not
here
and
i
would
take
responsible
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
i'd
be
glad
to
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no
(voice
overlap).
mr.
mark
wilmer
if
i
had
realized
it
that
we
would
have
it
here
your
honor
but
we'd
be
very
happy
to
do
it,
supply
it
ourselves.
mrs.
baird
can
supply
whatever
she
can
be.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
the
broadness
of
the
question
states
all
of
the
decisions.
mr.
mark
wilmer
it
would
do
it
in
my
judgment
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
would
accept
it
on
its
face
value
among
something
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
correct.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i'm
trying
to
make
that
point
your
honor
that
we
do
not
have
the
facilities
to
chase
down
each
organization
and
we
feel
that
if
someone
knows
it
that
she
tell
us
but
we
do
disagree
with
a
notion
that
they
are
oblige
to
research
and
that
all
they
need
to
say
is
i
don't
know
if
they
don't
know.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
mark
wilmer
my
interpretation
of
that
question
your
honor
is
really
that
it
is
a
duplication
of
27.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
i
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
she
didn't
answer
27.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
i'm
sure
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
at
the
outset,
i
think
make
two
observations.
first
being
that
the
committee
has
no
part
to
exclude
anybody
from
the
practice
of
law
in
the
state
of
arizona.
so
please
bear
in
mind
the
fact
that
the
court
is
not
abdicated
and
shut
its
prerogatives
in
that
respect.
mr.
mark
wilmer
referring
to
the
committee,
we
were
advice
by
counsel
that
the
committee
had
refused
to
or
had
excluded
sara
baird
from
admission
to
practice.
my
only
observation
is
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona
enjoys
that
prerogative
and
not
this
committee.
i
think
to
put
this
case
in
what
i
would
consider
to
be
a
true
perspective
as
to
what’s
really
at
issue
here,
it
might
be
well
that
just
first
briefly
review
the
actual
procedures
in
the
state
of
arizona
in
relationship
to
the
problem
which
is
before
this
court.
we
have
filed
for
the
convenience
of
the
court
with
the
clerk
copies
of
the
printed
rules
adopted
by
our
supreme
court.
these
rules
are
found
in
the
arizona
revised
statutes
in
volume
17
in
the
packet
part
but
for
the
convenience
of
the
court
since
these
are
printed
for
all
applicants,
we
have
supplied
the
clerk
with
printed
copies
and
these
copies
as
supplied
are
those
applicable
at
the
time
of
this
controversy.
there
are
certain
amendments
indicated
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
matter.
they
relate
the
fees
in
that
matter
which
are
not
involved
here
so
for
the
purposes
of
this
problem,
this
controversy,
the
printed
rules
are
appropriate
and
are
authentic.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
beg
your
pardon.
no,
your
honor,
i’m
speaking
of
a
small
pamphlet
like
this
that
was
given
to
the
--
a
number
of
them
to
the
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
no,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no,
there
are
more
rules
than
that,
your
honor
and
i
will
make
specific
reference
to
what
i’m
speaking
of.
i’m
referring
to
the
responsibility
and
the
function
which
a
committee
performs.
i’m
referring
to
the
problem
that
was
before
this
committee
which
caused
this
committee
to
take
the
position
it
did
and
which
has
led
to
this
controversy.
for
counsel,
i
am
sure
inadvertently
stated
that
sara
baird
had
been
rejected
for
admission
to
the
bar
of
the
state
of
arizona.
this
is
an
inaccurate
statement.
the
matter
is
like
mohammed’s
coffin,
suspended
between
heaven
and
earth.
the
committee
has
made
no
recommendation
to
the
court
and
the
court
has
made
no
ruling
in
the
matter.
the
rules
first
provide
with
respect
to
the
obligation
to
the
committee.
no
applicant
shall
--
will
be
examined
until
this
application
has
been
considered
enacted
upon
by
and
permission
granted
by
the
committee
to
take
such
examination.
no
permission
shall
be
grant
--
will
be
granted
until
it
is
established
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
committee
and
there
follows
a
number
of
things
the
supreme
court
requires
of
the
committee
that
they
affirmatively
find
before
they
permit
the
applicant
to
sit
for
the
examination.
the
rules
provide
that
the
applicant
must
file
an
affidavit
and
questionnaire
and
that
mr.
justice
black
is
the
instrument
that
is
printed
as
the
appendix
and
it
is
also
contained
in
this
little
pamphlet
which
i
have
distributed.
the
rule
and
i’m
reading
from
page
5
of
the
pamphlet,
“after
said
applicants
questionnaire
and
affidavit
fully
answered
under
oath
is
filed,
the
committee
will
make
such
investigation
as
it
deems
proper
for
the
purposes
of
determining
whether
or
not
the
applicant
possesses
the
qualifications
specified
in
rule
6
such
investigation
were
ordinarily
not
required
within
30
days
and
includes
a
right
to
require
a
personal
interview.”
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
a
character
committee
as
well
as
an
examinations
committee
is
faced
at
least
it
seems
to
the
members
of
the
committee
where
it
very
honors
responsibility.
the
responsibility
of
telling
to
the
supreme
court
of
whatever
state
it
acts,
it
sits
in
that
this
particular
man
does
in
fact
or
this
particular
woman
does
in
fact
possess
not
only
the
learning
qualifications,
the
knowledge
of
the
law
but
also
possesses
the
character
which
can
be
safely
entrusted
with
the
many
responsibilities
and
privileges
and
prerogatives
which
do
attest
to
the
office
of
--
or
the
privilege
of
being
an
attorney.
now,
i’d
like
also
to
emphasize
to
the
court
so
that
this
question
of
due
process
and
this
question
of
arbitrary
treatment
is
put
the
rest
of
ours
in
the
state
of
arizona
is
concerned.
the
court
will
note,
and
i’m
reading
now
from
page
9
i’m
referring
now
to
page
9
of
this
pamphlet,
that
our
supreme
court
has
spelled
out
with
reasonable
meticulous
detail
what
must
be
done
before
the
committee
may
reject
and
what
it
must
do
if
it
does
reject
an
applicant.
the
rules
provide
for
two
types
of
proceedings,
the
informal
proceeding
and
a
formal
proceeding.
this
is
before
the
committee
in
considering
whether
an
applicant
should
be
recommended
for
admission
or
not.
if
the
record
upon
which
the
committee
is
going
to
act
is
one
which
has
been
supplied
by
the
applicant,
if
it
is
a
record
which
either
represents
what
he
has
said
and
has
filed
with
the
committee
and
what
is
on
the
face
of
the
record
what
the
committee
is
going
to
act
on.
the
committee
may
then
supplement
that
by
informal
conferences
with
the
applicant
but
the
rule
specifically
say
that
if
you’re
going
to
supplement
that
record
upon
which
you
are
going
to
deny
this
man
permission
to
practice,
you
must
do
it
in
writing
if
he
asks
for
it.
if
it
is
an
interview,
it
must
be
stenographic
to
report
an
interview.
it
must
be
filed
with
the
applicants
file.
the
rule
says,
if
you’re
going
to
deny
him
permission
or
not
deny
him,
i
beg
your
pardon,
if
you’re
going
to
recommend
against
his
admission,
you
then
must
put
a
writing
and
in
his
file
the
specific
reasons
why
you’re
denying
him,
you’re
recommending
against
his
admission
and
that
must
be
available
for
consideration
by
the
court.
in
other
words
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
may
i
come
to
that
moment
in
a
moment
shortly.
that
is
true
in
a
sense.
in
a
sense,
that
is
not
entirely
true.
i’ll
be
with
that
immediately.
the
rules
provide
that
we
may
not
permit
an
applicant
to
sit
for
a
bar
exam
but
for
many
years
by
a
tacit
approval
of
the
supreme
court
or
a
file
has
not
been
completely
clear,
an
applicant
is
permitted
conditionally
to
take
the
bar
exam.
an
applicant
signs
a
letter
stating
he
understand
or
she
understands
its
a
conditional
thing
and
that
if
the
file
is
not
clear,
the
grades
will
not
be
completed
and
the
applicant
will
not
be
recommended.
in
other
words,
with
a
six
months
log
if
you
have
a
small
tag
end
in
that
hasn’t
been
cleared
up,
if
you
have
as
in
this
case
it
would
appear
maybe
an
over
side
even.
you
don’t
deny
that
applicant
the
right
to
sit
for
the
bar
exam
and
say
you
got
a
wait
six
months
to
sit
again.
you
say
you
can
take
it
conditionally
upon
your
file
being
cleared
and
you
being
recommended
to
the
supreme
court
for
admission.
and
in
this
case
as
is
reflected
either
in
the
printed
record
or
on
the
record
which
has
come
up
from
the
arizona
supreme
court,
sara
baird
sat
conditionally
because
her
file
had
not
been
cleared.
now,
there
is
no
point
in
quibbling
about
it,
but
tentative
grading
of
sara
baird’s
papers
showed
she
did
a
good
job.
she’s
entitled
on
the
basis
of
the
tentative
examination
to
be
admitted
on
the
basis
of
her
learning
in
the
law.
the
committee
follows
her
practice
of
holding
a
formal
session
before
the
grades
are
released
and
clearing
all
files
and
if
they
are
not
cleared,
the
grades
are
not
finally
approved
and
the
applicant
is
not
recommended
to
the
supreme
court.
that
is
the
situation
we
have
here.
the
grades
have
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
mark
wilmer
i’m
not
--
i
could
not
answer
that.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
know
it
is
true,
your
honor
that
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
theoretically,
your
honor,
we
should
not
let
them
take
the
bar
examine
until
they
have
been
cleared.
theoretically,
under
the
rules
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
then
if
the
--
before
they
sit
for
the
bar
exam,
they
are
supposed
to
be
cleared.
before
an
applicant
is
permitted
to
sit,
the
right
to
bar
exam
under
our
rules,
that
applicant’s
file
should
be
cleared
and
prepared
--
the
committee
prepared
to
recommend
that
applicant
for
admission
to
the
supreme
court
if
they
pass
the
bar
exam.
but
in
other
states,
i
know
they
have
separate
committees
that
function.
i’m
not
really
familiar
enough
on
that,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
said
this,
your
honor,
that
because
of
the
fact
we
give
examinations
only
twice
a
year
that
the
committee
has
taken
the
prerogative
and
the
court
has
with
knowledge
of
it
has
made
the
objection
that
if
there
is
some
tag
end
of
the
file,
there
is
something
that
the
file
has
not
been
cleared
or
sometimes
the
nation
conference
is
slow
in
getting
back
their
reports.
the
applicant
is
permitted
to
right
to
bar
examination
conditionally,
that
condition
being
that
you’re
not
going
to
be
recommended
and
your
grades
are
not
going
to
be
finally
approved
unless
your
file
is
cleared
and
in
this
case,
the
file
was
not
cleared
because
this
one
question
wasn’t
answered.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i’m
not
really
sure
whether
that
is
an
accurate
statement,
your
honor,
it
should
be
“we
write
them
a
letter
and
say
we’re
going
to
let
you
take
it
conditionally
because
your
file
hasn’t
been
cleared.
but
if
your
file
is
not
cleared,
you’re
--
we’re
not
going
to
complete
processing
the
examination.
it’s
a
favor
to
the
applicant.
it
does
the
supreme
court
and
the
committee
no
good
because
we’ll
say
okay,
wait
for
another
six
months
and
so
little
basis
for
complain
of
that
being
arbitrary
action.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
there
is
your
honor.
might
i
just
say
one
other
thing
that
the
other
procedure
that
the
supreme
court
has
required
involves
were
there
is
not
in
the
record
the
basis
for
the
exclusion.
in
that
case,
a
formal
hearing
is
required.
the
applicant
is
permitted
to
have
a
full
examination
of
the
matters
that
are
involved
and
a
written
decision
must
be
made
by
the
committee
stating
the
facts
separately
on
the
basis
of
which
denial
of
the
committee
is
recommended.
now
answering
justice
harlan,
in
the
briefs
and
in
the
response
which
the
--
that’s
why
i
say
i’d
like
to
put
this
in
perspective.
cited
in
page
4
of
the
petitioner
writ
of
certiorari
and
repeated
and
the
other
this
comes
to
hand
readily.
this
is
the
response
the
committee
made
to
the
supreme
court
on
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
unless
we
are
to
conclude
that
one
who
truly
and
sincerely
believes
in
the
overthrow
of
the
united
states
governed
by
force
and
violence
is
also
qualified
to
practice
law
on
our
arizona
courts
then
an
answer
to
this
question
is
indeed
appropriate.
the
committee
again
emphasizes
that
a
mere
answer
of
“yes”
would
not
lead
to
an
automatic
rejection
of
the
applicant.
it
will
lead
to
an
investigation
and
interrogation
as
to
whether
or
not
the
applicant
presently
entertains
the
view
that
a
violent
overthrow
the
united
states
government
is
something
to
be
sought
after.
now
when
counsel
said,
we
are
looking
for
political
belief,
it
simply
not
the
case.
we’re
interested
in
finding
out
if
an
applicant
in
fact
believes
is
proper
to
take
exposed
it
into
a
courtroom.
if
it’s
proper
for
a
lawyer
to
rule
on
a
motion
of
a
present
overthrow
of
the
government,
that’s
what
we
are
after
here
and
we’re
entirely
indifferent
to
political
beliefs
in
the
sense
of
pure
political
beliefs
which
are
not
those
of
an
activists
and
of
the
political
beliefs
are
those
of
violence
and
they’re
the
beliefs
of
an
activists.
yes,
i
would
say
to
this
court,
we
would
reject
them
and
recommend
to
the
court
they
be
rejected.
if
the
answer
to
the
inquiry
was
“yes”
then
indeed,
no
i’m
sorry,
it
will
lead
to
an
investigation
and
interrogation
as
to
whether
or
not
the
applicant
presently
entertains
that
view
that
a
violent
overthrow
of
the
united
states
government
is
something
to
be
sought
after.
if
the
answer
to
this
inquiry
was
“yes”
then
indeed,
in
other
words,
that
they
are
in
favor
of
violent
to
overthrow
the
government
now,
we
would
reject
the
applicant
or
recommend
against
her
admission.
we
go
on
to
say
and
this
is
the
committee’s
official
position
in
this
matter.
i
believe
that
mrs.
baird
should
realize
that
even
though
she
answered
the
question,
that
she
had
one
time
been
a
communist
or
had
otherwise
been
an
associate
with
organizations
not
regard
as
friend
of
the
united
states
government,
then
we
would
not,
that’s
--
that
would
not
necessarily
call
as
to
reject
her
application.
we
would
undoubtedly
going
to
ask
her
some
questions
as
to
her
present
beliefs
and
as
to
other
matter
to
which
would
bear
upon
the
effect
on
such
membership
would
have
upon
her
qualifications
to
practice
law.
the
committee
would
again
emphasize
to
this
court
that
if
the
answer
to
question
27
is
“yes”
the
committee
will
then
endeavor
to
ascertain
if
sara
baird
does
adhere
to
the
view
that
the
overthrow
of
the
united
states
government
of
this
state
and
of
the
united
states
by
force
and
violence
would
be
a
desirable
objective,
and
that
she
would
expect
to
actively
support
such
views.
now,
it
seems
to
me
if
it
please
the
court,
that
this
is
sufficient
to
put
this
case
in
a
posture,
in
a
clear
context
to
what
is
really
involved
in
this
case.
the
committee
has
no
resources.
it
depends
upon
what
is
brought
to
its
attention.
it
can
only
inquire
by
way
of
interrogation
such
as
this
and
trying
to
reach
some
conclusion.
when
an
applicant
refuses
to
answer
a
question,
an
applicant
who
is
asking
for
a
recommendation
certifying
to
their
integrity
and
honesty
and
ability
to
practice
law
and
their
willingness
to
uphold
institution
to
this
country
in
so
far
as
the
practice
requires,
certainly
the
committee
is
not
in
the
position
to
sign
their
name
for
certification
of
this
particular
applicant
is
prepared
to
and
should
be
admitted
to
practice
law.
and
that’s
what
is
the
issue
in
this
case,
it’s
whether
or
not
a
committee
should
be
required
to
certify
to
something
which
they
don’t
know
is
true
or
not.
and
which
goes
to
the
very
heart
at
least,
we
think
of
the
soundest
of
our
judicial
system
and
its
future
usage
in
this
country.
now,
if
i
may
be
excuse
for
having
raised
my
voice,
i
will
proceed.
the
whole
matter
here,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
us
is
that
the
requirements
which
counsel
says
we
have
rejected
and
counsel
says
we
are
ignoring
of
seeking
after
political
beliefs,
of
seeking
after
what
does
this
particular
applicant
think
about
is
wholly
outside
of
an
alley
in
this
record.
a
committee
can
only
bring
in
an
applicant
and
say
now,
what
do
you
believe
about
this
and
then
you
have
to
make
a
judgment
factors.
are
they
telling
the
truth
or
not?
do
you
think
it
is
a
good
idea
to
carry
for
exposures
to
be
carried
into
the
courtroom,
to
carry
into
the
united
states
congress
chambers?
what
do
you
think
about
these
things?
many
other
questions
and
you
finally
come
to
conclusion
that
either
this
is
someone
who
simply,
ideologically
entertains
certain
views
you
don’t
believe
in,
and
that
is
none
of
our
business.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
right.
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
correct,
unless
something
else
shapes
up
in
the
answers,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
these
files
are
read
carefully
to
see
if
there
are
any
caveats
that
should
be
ceased
upon
and
pursued.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
suspect
in
this
case,
your
honor,
it
would
have
been
ignored
and
the
file
would
have
been
closed
and
the
applicant
would
have
been
approved.
in
other
words
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
nothing
else.
i
may
be
very
frank
with
the
court.
nothing
else
in
the
file
indicated
anything
wrong.
nothing
else
in
the
file
indicated
there’s
anything
wrong
with
this
lady,
that
she
had
any
bad
background
that
she
had
been
belong
to
organizations
that
were
wrong
or
anything
else,
or
that
wrong
in
the
sense
of
being
what
we
would
have
at
least
think
of
a
subversive
or
activists
against
the
best
interest
of
the
country.
so
that
if
she’d
answered,
not
applic
--
if
she’d
answered
“i
don’t
know
of
any
organizations”,
that’s
acceptable.
we
have
no
right
to
have
her
go
out
and
make
any
search
and
investigation
to
determine
what
or
shall
of
these
things
means
that
she
said
that
she
belong
to.
this
one
other
thing
i
meant
to
bring
to
your
court’s
attention
before
i
pass
on
this
one,
the
thing
is
the
committee’s
attention.
the
further
portion
of
her
response
that
were
made
in
the
supreme
court
that
if
this
is
the
conclusion
reached
by
the
committee,
that
is
that
she
is
an
activist
in
the
sense
of
believing
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence,
it
will
undoubtedly
refuse
to
recommend
sara
baird
for
admission
to
the
bar
of
arizona.
now,
should
the
conclusion
be
that
her
membership
is
of
a
nominal
character
and
that
she
does
not
participate
and
adhere
to
the
views
that
a
violent
overthrow
of
our
government
our
desirable,
then
the
committee
would
have
no
legal
basis
for
refusing
to
recommend
her
for
admission.
now,
that
is
the
position
of
this
committee
before
the
supreme
court
of
arizona.
it’s
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
i’m
reading
from
our
response
to
the
order
to
show
your
cause,
your
honor,
in
arizona
supreme
court.
that
is
found
in
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
as
filed
by
the
petitioner
here
and
i
was
reading
from
page
5
of
that
petition.
mr.
mark
wilmer
she
was
never
interrogated,
your
honor.
in
other
words
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
the
questionnaire
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
was
the
question
she
said
“not
applicable.”
mr.
mark
wilmer
that’s
the
question
she
said
“not
applicable.”
so
the
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
she
had
answered
the
organizations,
your
honor.
we
had
really
no
right
to
ask
her
this
27
question,
lest
do
you
belong
to
a
communist
party
because
we
had
already
ask
her
to
list
all
the
organizations
to
which
you
have
been
a
member.
mr.
mark
wilmer
so
theoretically,
at
least
she
had
answered
that
question
and
the
only
question
she
refused
to
answer
was,
“do
you
belong
to
or
have
you
belong
to
an
organization
which
believes
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
united
states
by
force
and
violence?”
mr.
mark
wilmer
no,
your
honor.
i’ve
said
that,
had
she
--
had
we
pursued
the
matter,
had
mrs.
baird
said
“yes,
i
do
believe”
or
“yes,
i
do
belong
to
organizations”
then
she
would
have
been
asked
to
appear
before
the
committee,
two
or
three
members
of
the
committee
and
would
have
been
ask
questions
about
what
in
fact
do
you
believe.
do
you
believe
in
overthrowing
it
now?
are
you
in
a
position?
mr.
mark
wilmer
that’s
what
we
would
have
done.
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
never
got
the
chance,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
never
got
the
chance.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
i
can
see,
your
honor,
we
might
have
done
this.
the
questionnaire,
however,
is
one
that’s
been
used
for
so
many,
many
years.
we
might
have
said,
“do
you
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government?”
mr.
mark
wilmer
pardon?
mr.
mark
wilmer
no.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
right.
right.
that
is
right,
your
honor
and
the
entire
purpose
of
that
question
if
the
answer
is
“yes”
is
to
then
give
us
a
lead
to
interrogate
the
applicant
as
to
what
in
fact
are
your
present
feelings
and
beliefs
and
intentions
with
respect
to
overthrow
of
the
government
by
violence.
that
is
intended
to
trigger
the
committee,
it
was
a
cover
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor,
if
i
had
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor,
i
concede
that
that
might
have
been
a
more
directive
approach
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
oh,
your
honor,
i
can’t
do
--
we
can’t
do
this
over
again.
this
is
history.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
ask
the
question,
“did
the
applicant
belong
to
or
had
the
applicant
belong
to
organizations
which
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence?”
that
question
was
answered
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
would
say
that
unquestionably
the
applicant
could
have
said
i
do
not
know,
i
cannot
tell
you
and
we
might
have
asked
her
what
do
you
belong
to.
but
it
doesn’t
seem
to
me
that
the
thrust
of
the
question,
your
honor,
is
directed
to
more
than
asking
the
applicant
to
put
on
the
record
what
her
background
is
or
what
his
background
is?
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
problem
the
committee
--
a
committee
faces
is
this.
you
are
only
able
to
do
so
much
investigation.
you
ask
questions
that
you
think
will
point
up
to
you
where
you
should
pursue
the
matter
further.
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
in
view
of
your
honor’s
suggestions,
i
think
probably
the
questionnaire
should
be
amended.
perhaps,
maybe
it’s
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
but
that
isn’t
the
questionnaire
we
have
here.
that
is
not
the
question
that
was
asked.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
i’m
simply
saying,
your
honor,
that
one
of
the
many
things
we
would
want
to
know
under
those
circumstances
would
be
that
question
but
what
i’m
trying
to
emphasize
is
that
if
there
is
something
in
the
file
which
leads
the
committee
to
believe
that
there
is
a
defect
in
the
character
of
the
applicant,
then
the
committee
ask
the
applicant
to
come
in
for
an
oral
interview
and
the
interview
is
stenographically
reported
and
made
a
part
of
the
record.
and
if
the
committee
does
any
action
based
upon
that
interview,
it
must
be
part
of
the
record
so
that
in
the
course
of
an
interview,
the
question
i
pose
here,
your
honor,
i
suggest
that
would
probably
have
been
asked
the
applicant
and
you
would
have
been
given
an
opportunity
to
deny
that
she
had
any
activist
feuds.
and
even
if
she
had
said
“yes”
and
if
she
had
come
in
and
showed
the
committee
that
she
didn’t
believe
in
the
present
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence,
that
she
would
not
participate,
she
didn’t
intend
to
participate
in
that.
if
her
views
were
those
simply
like
i
belong
to
the
altar
(ph),
i
belong
to
this,
i
belong
to
that.
i
don’t
really
know
what
they
stand
for.
the
committee
would
have
said,
“fine,
you’re
admitted.
you’re
recommended
for
admission.”
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
your
honor,
i
recognize
the
criticism
of
the
court
and
i
think
it’s
something
that
should
be
considered
but
unfortunately
this
case
can’t
be
run
be
backward
like
you
do
a
replay
on
a
football
game.
this
has
been
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
are
trying
to
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
but
your
honor,
if
you’re
going
to
certify
to
our
supreme
court
that
this
particular
applicant
is
qualified
mentally,
morally
and
by
character,
we
have
to
have
the
range
of
a
large
number
of
questions,
otherwise
it
is
impossible
to
make
such
a
certification
if
you
can
ask
these
questions
of
a
person
who
wants
the
privilege
of
practicing
law.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
did
not
come
here
citing
that
case
and
sitting
down,
your
honor,
i
attempted
to
make
an
argument.
i
would
simply
say
that
it
seems
all
of
these
arguments
that
have
been
made,
all
of
these
nice
distinctions
attempted
to
be
drawn
comes
squarely
within
the
rule
of
this
court
as
repeated
so
often
that
it’s
almost
like
saying
the
“holy
mary”
or
the
“our
father”
to
a
catholic.
the
question
is
simply
is
where
you
have
an
interplay
of
first
amendment
rights
and
of
a
personal
claim
such
as
this
lady
presents.
it
then
thus
become
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
state’s
rights,
the
overwhelmingly
needs
of
the
state
are
such
as
to
require
a
little,
tiny
answer
we
want
from
this
witness.
in
other
words,
whether
or
not,
the
right
of
the
state
to
ascertain
if
the
character
of
a
person
who
wants
to
be
admitted
to
practice
law
is
such,
they
should
be
admitted
is
of
sufficient
importance
to
entrust,
to
require
to
that
particular
person
make
a
disclosure
of
their
true
beliefs
and
positions
and
expectations
if
they
are
permitted
to
practice
law.
we
think
the
answer
should
be
that
in
fact
the
state
does
have
that
right
and
whatever
minor,
as
they
say,
that
advice
to
the
minor
exposures
required
by
this
question
is
a
very
small
price
for
the
applicant
to
pay
who
seeks
the
privilege
of
a
practicing
attorney
in
the
courts
of
the
state
and
who
should
assume
a
responsibilities
is
that
you
go
with
that.
now,
i’ll
just
say
one
thing
in
closing.
i
realize
that
an
answer
to
this
question
is
not
going
to
do
very
much
the
way
of
catching
anybody.
but
i
do
say
that
for
this
court
to
say
to
the
young
law
students
of
our
country
for
this
court
to
declare
by
formal
opinion
that
an
inquiry
as
to
whether
the
beliefs
of
those
law
students,
their
beliefs
are
such
that
they
are
permitted
to
espouse
a
belief
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
violence,
the
fact
that
this
court
was
willing
to
say
that
we
don’t
consider
of
enough
importance
what
you
believe
in
this
respect,
what
you’re
actually
are
thinking
in
this
respect
to
permit
the
committee
to
inquire
of
it,
it
seems
to
me
would
indeed
be
an
invitation
to
the
young
law
students.
to
think
the
practice
of
law
really
is
pretty
much
something
like
as
exemplified
in
some
of
our
recent
court
trials.
