number
53,
baird
against
arizona.
mr.
baird.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
that's
one
question
or
more
than
one
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
brief
as
i
followed
your
arguments
in
the
brief
places
a
great
deal
of
emphasizes
on
the
invasion
of
the
petitioners
right
of
free
political
association
but
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
do
you
include
the
second
half
of
that
question
that
is
the
question
addressed
to
whether
there
is
membership
in
any
organization
advocating
the
overthrow
by
force
of
the
government
as
an
invasion
of
politically,
constitutionally
protected
right
to
political
association?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
that
means
you
contend
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right,
guaranteed
and
protected
right
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
follow?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
hope
sometime
while
you're
on
your
feet
you'll
explain
that
to
me.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
think
that
this
question
would
be
a
similarly
inappropriate
to
ask
a
candidate,
an
applicant
for
a
job
as
a
police
officer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
are
you
suggesting
that
on
the
record
as
it
now
stands
before
us,
this
case
is
in
the
same
posture
as
it
would
be
if
she
had
answered
27
by
saying
"i
have
already
answered
this
question
and
answer
25"?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
it
is
a
different
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think,
mr.
baird
you
have
one
minute
left
and
i
take
it
you're
reserving
that
for
a
rebuttal.
mr.
wilmer,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
i
ask
you
another
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
application
require
an
applicant
to
restate
whether
he
or
she
has
ever
been
convicted
of
a
criminal
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
if
there
was
an
applicant
refuses
to
answer
that
particular
question,
with
that
applicant
be
done
on
the
same
procedure
that
mrs.
baird
is
in
at
the
present
time
with
reference
to
the
board's
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
then,
if
the
answer
to
that
question
might
be
yes
when
i
was
14
years
old,
i
was
found
guilty
as
a
juvenile
of
some
offense,
would
that
in
and
of
itself
bar
or
prevent
her
admission
as
a
member
of
the
bar?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
have
just
one
minute
left
mr.
baird.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
baird.
thank
you
for
your
submission
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
next
case
on
for
argument
is
baird
against
the
state
of
arizona
number
15.
mr.
baird,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
sort
of
a
catchall
question,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you,
i’m
not
sure
this
is
relevant,
but
would
you
extend
that
first
amendment
to
include
similar
application
for
a
man
seeking
appointment
as
a
policeman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
they
must
hire
him
as
a
policeman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
assuming
he
meets
the,
whatever
the
other
qualifications
are--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
say,
he
must
be
hired
under
the
first
amendment
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
even
though
he
believes
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
first
amendment
known
to
be
as
good
for
policeman
as
for
the
lawyers,
i
should
think--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
mr.
garland
who
later
became
attorney
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
keep
emphasizing
belief,
mr.
baird.
as
i
look
at
this
question
again,
the
question
asks
about
organizations
which
are
dedicated
to
overthrowing
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
now,
do
you
reach
a
belief
problem
until
you
get
first
an
answer
to
the
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
reach
the
belief
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
exclude
or
inquire
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
baird.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wilmer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
said
court,
do
you
refer
to
the
supreme
court
of
arizona?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
baird,
i
have
a
couple
of
questions
on
the
application
which
i
have
been
looking
at,
if
you
don’t
mind.
i
notice
that
in
question
--
answer
to
question
24
about
the
organizations
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
25
is
it?
the
25,
the
list
that
in
partly
in
turn
a
member
of
the
young
republican
party
and
then
the
young
democrat
party.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
in
light
of
your
arguments
about
the
sensitivity
to
inquiry
and
political
associations,
i
wonder
how
that’s
squares
with
your
argument
on
the
failure
to
answer
the
other
question.
in
question
25,
petitioner
exhibited
no
concern
about
discussing
former
political
affiliations
or
at
present.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
me
go
back
counsel.
suppose
the
questionnaire
said,
“are
you
a
member
of
the
republican
party
or
democratic
party?”
check
one.
i
would
think
that
you’d
get
a
very
hospitable
reception
in
any
court
to
say
that
that’s
not
a
question
which
they
have
any
right
to
ask.
i
should
think
on
prior
decisions
but
yet
she
had
no
difficulty
answering
and
saying
that
she
was
a
member
at
one
time
or
another,
both
major
parties
and
that
doesn’t
really
square
with
your
protestations
about
resistance
to
inquiry
in
the
political
belief
and
political
association.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
it
ever
stated
that
it
is
to
find
out
what
party
she
belongs
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
she
listed
it,
but
i
understood
also
it
seemed
that
yes,
something
indicated
that
the
committee
has
admitted
they
wanted
to
ask
her
about
whether
she
belonged
to
democratic
and
republican
party?
is
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
baird.
thank
