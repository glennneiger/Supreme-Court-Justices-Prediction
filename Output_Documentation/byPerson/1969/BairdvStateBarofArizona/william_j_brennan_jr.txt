but
what
about
this
mr.
baird,
i
noticed
mr.
wilmer's
brief
in
page
three.
he
says
"this
committee
has
made
it
abundantly
clear
that
regardless
of
the
political
beliefs
and
views
of
sara
baird.
it
is
only
if
she
is
found
to
be
actively
believed
to
the
notion
of
the
spouse
an
act
of
this
rule
in
implementing
the
notion
that
our
government
be
destroyed
by
course
of
violence
that
a
favorable
recommendation
will
be
reputed
by
the
committee."
i
gather
the
argument
is
that
they
ask
the
question
only
to
illicit
the
answer
to
something
like
this
and
if
she
doesn't
answer
that
she
actively
believes
in
or
a
spouse
as
an
activist
role,
but
then
she
be
admitted
to
bar,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
certainly
is
far
cry
from
what
they
said
before,
am
i
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
we
are
opposed
or
are
you
with
deciding
this
on
the
basis
of
memorandum
or
deciding
this
on
the
basis
of
the
argument
of
the
brief,
which?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
expect
you
would,
but
well,
let
me
ask
this,
do
you
suppose
the
committee
if
indeed
the
question
were
directed
to
what
the
board
is
now
said
that
the
directives
that
constitutionally
bears
and
it
has
any
other
claims?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

is
this
a
first
amendment
argument?
