unknown
speaker
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence?
unknown
speaker
but
not
to
control
the
government
alone?
unknown
speaker
by
force
or
violence.
unknown
speaker
if
you’re
in
that
breadth?
unknown
speaker
suppose
you’re
wrong
in
that
breadth
that
you
have
cite?
do
you
say
that
it
is
necessarily
follows
because
a
policeman
could
not
be
fired,
it
follows
that
a
lawyer
can
be
denied
admission
to
the
bar
and
do
you
think
it
is
identical?
unknown
speaker
does
mrs.
baird
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
which
question
specifically?
unknown
speaker
which
doesn’t
ask
about
her
belief,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn’t
say
whether
--
say
whether
any
of
those
where
she’s
been
a
member
of
any
organization
that
advocates.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn’t
say
about
her
belief,
she
could
be
that
fully
objective
about
it.
wouldn’t
your
case
be
a
lot
stronger
if
she
answered
the
question
27?
unknown
speaker
what
happens
if
there
is
no
barrier
because
and
then
we
can
say
that
we
haven’t
answered
our
questions?
unknown
speaker
would
you
tell
me
--
would
you
tell
me
again
because
i
couldn’t
hear
it
before,
the
citation
of
the
case
in
which
this
court
has
said
that
one
has
a
right
to
practice
law.
unknown
speaker
mr.
baird
if
you
have
answered
--
if
ms.
baird
had
answered
27,
not
to
my
knowledge,
would
that
have
been
an
acceptable
answer?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
do
you
know
that
an
answer
not
to
my
knowledge
would
have
been
deemed
unacceptable?
unknown
speaker
that
doesn’t
trigger
any
an
investigation?
unknown
speaker
over
that
you
are
reading?
unknown
speaker
did
they
ask
her
that
direct
question?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
the
questionnaire
--
unknown
speaker
--
whether
she
believed
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
unknown
speaker
that
was
the
one
that
you
are
trying
to
ask.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
was
about
belonging
to
an
organization?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
where
is
that
question
which
asked
her
if
she
believed
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government?
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
what
you’ve
been
arguing.
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
you
are
emphasizing
but
did
--
why
didn’t
they
ask
her
that?
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
had
a
chance
in
the
questionnaire.
unknown
speaker
but
that’s
what’s
you
asked,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
that’s
what’s
you
asked
whether
she
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence?
that
wasn’t
your
question.
unknown
speaker
you
should
ask
her
if
any
of
the
organizations
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
why
did
you
have
to
have
something
to
trigger
a
question
which
was
really
of
what
you
are
interested
in?
unknown
speaker
what
you’re
interested
in
(voice
overlap)
whether
she
belonged
to
an
organization
or
whether
she
belonged
or
didn’t
not
whether
she
belong
whether
she
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force?
unknown
speaker
it
might
have
been.
it
would
have
been,
wouldn’t
it?
that’s
a
direct
way
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
can’t
do
it
over
but
you
didn’t
ask
that
question.
unknown
speaker
you
didn’t.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
a
pretty
difficult
question
for
anybody
to
answer.
we
belong
to
many
organizations,
wouldn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
but
her
organizations,
not
her
belief
and
whether
or
not
the
government
should
be
overthrown.
unknown
speaker
it’s
not
much
trouble
to
add
a
question
to
a
long
list
of
questions
in
the
questionnaire.
do
you
belong
--
do
you
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force?
unknown
speaker
that
wouldn’t
have
bothered
anybody
with
it.
unknown
speaker
i
would
if
that’s
what
you
want
to
find
out.
unknown
speaker
it’s
not
the
question
you
have
and
therefore
i
am
asking
you.
why
you
didn’t
have
it,
if
that’s
what
you
wanted
to
know.
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
the
committee
was
that
anxious
to
find
about
the
organization
to
which
the
person
belong
it.
that
the
person
couldn’t
guess.
that
would
be
the
general
attitude
of
the
committee
that
you
suggested.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
to
run
backward,
but
you
have
to
stand
on
what
you’re
asked.
unknown
speaker
and
you
have
said
that
--
your
interest
in
that
is
that
she
might
have
given
them
some
information
that
would
authorize
them
to
ask
another
question
which
you
could
have
asked
but
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that’s
essential
question,
the
point
of
what
you
wanted.
i
can’t
quite
understand
why
anybody
would
have
failed
to
ask
her.
well,
at
least
since
konigsberg
too,
you
sanctioned
on
the
judgment
of
this
court.
unknown
speaker
that
was
the
majority
of
them.
unknown
speaker
did
that
question
actually
call
then
to
tell
about
the
parties
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
ones
she
answered
by
referring
to
republican
or
democratic
parties?[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
that
question
exactly?
unknown
speaker
did
the
question
actually
call
for
her
to
give
the
names
of
the
parties
because
there
are
many
people
who
believe
both
those
parties
are
subversive.
unknown
speaker
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence?
unknown
speaker
but
not
to
control
the
government
alone?
unknown
speaker
by

speaker
if
you’re
