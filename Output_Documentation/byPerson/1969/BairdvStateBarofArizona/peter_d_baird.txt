mr.
peter
d.
baird
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
peter
baird
and
i
represent
petitioner
and
this
cause.
the
case
before
you
is
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
and
it
concerns
a
refusal
to
admit
petitioner
to
the
practice
of
law
in
arizona.
she
has
graduated
from
stanford
law
school,
she
has
passed
the
bar
examination
and
the
refusal
stands
upon
her
refusal
to
completely
fill
out
a
questionnaire
and
affidavit
prescribed
by
the
arizona
rules
of
the
supreme
court
of
arizona.
there
are
two
particular
questions
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
first
is
the
question
she
did
answer
and
this
was
question
25
and
we
set
it
for
on
page
three
of
our
brief.
this
is
and
i
quote,
"list
all
organizations,
associations
and
clubs
other
than
bar
associations
of
which
you
are
or
have
been
a
member
since
attaining
the
age
of
16
years."
this
petitioner
did,
she
listed
each
and
every
organization
to
which
she
has
belonged.
the
next
question
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
do
not
have
as
part
of
the
record
the
answers
to
the
questions.
that
is
part
of
the
committees’
files
and
they
were
not
introduced
so
far
as
i
know
before
at
the
supreme
court.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
we
alleged
that
in
our
verified
petition
before
the
arizona
supreme
court
and
so
far
as
i
know
this
was
not
denied
and
the
refusal
to
admit
petitioner
is
expressly
based
by
the
committee
upon
her
refusal
to
answer
question
27,
not
question
25.
question
27
reads
as
follows
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
that
is
true,
as
part
of
the
record
you
do
not
know
the
names
of
the
organizations
to
which
she
has
belong
which
she
did
list.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
her
question,
question
27
reads
"are
you
now
or
have
you
ever
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
any
organization
that
advocates,
overthrow
of
the
untied
states
government
by
force
or
violence."
there
is
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
would
say
mr.
chief
justice
that
really
is
two
questions,
one
which
overlaps
with
the
first
question
which
she
answered.
in
other
words
the
reference
to
communist
party
would
show
up
in
the
question
which
she
did
answer.
if
she
had
belonged
to
the
communist
party,
it
would
have
showed
up
in
response
to
question
25
and
there
is
no
contention
i
might
add
parenthetically
that
any
of
those
really
is
a
communist
party.
so
the
essence
of
her
refusal
goes
to
the
requirement
that
she
characterized.
the
group
she
belonged
to
and
listed
in
response
to
25
as
to
whether
they
do
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
we
do
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
that
is
not
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
no,
i
do
not
believe
it
do,
i
think
that
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
will
--
i
shall
do
it
right
now
as
a
matter
of
fact.
the
question
as
to
forcing
her
to
characterize
whether
any
of
the
groups
that
she
has
belonged
to
is
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
and
violence
requires
her
to
state
whether
under
the
smith
act
as
i
understand
it.
any
of
them
actually
does
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government.
now,
the
burden
upon
the
petitioner
is
significant
in
that
respect.
it
requires
her
to
make
various
value
judgments
under
the
smith
act
and
therefore
would
make
her
less
likely
to
join
these
organizations.
as
to
whether
membership
per
se,
in
this
kind
of
an
organization
is
unprotected
conduct,
i
think
that
under
the
decisions
in
elf
brown
and
perhaps
in
robel
that
one
must
actually
have
a
specific
content
to
overthrow
the
government.
be
an
active
member,
know
that
the
organization
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
and
share
that
purpose
before
that
association
or
status
maybe
proscribed.
the
most
significant
aspect
of
question
27
apart
from
the
freedom
of
association
aspect
is
the
purpose
for
which
question
27
is
asked
and
this
is
extremely
important
in
the
freedom
of
association
area
where
the
burden
in
not
upon
the
applicant
to
state
why
she
shouldn't
have
to
answer
it.
the
burden
is
shifted
to
the
state
to
come
forth
with
a
compelling
state
interest
to
say
why
she
should
answer
it.
the
compelling
state
interest
which
the
state
has
come
forward
with
in
this
case
and
presented
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
is
and
i
quote
as
follows.
"unless
we
are
to
conclude
that
one
who
truly
and
sincerely
believes
in
the
overthrow
of
the
united
states
government
by
force
and
violence
is
also
qualified
to
practice
laws
in
our
arizona
courts
that
an
answer
to
this
question
is
indeed
appropriate."
the
committee
again
emphasizes
that
a
mere
answer
of
yes
would
not
lead
to
an
automatic
rejection
of
an
application.
it
would
lead
to
an
investigation
and
interrogation
as
to
whether
the
applicant
presently
entertains
the
view
that
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
is
something
to
be
sought
to
be
sought
after.
if
the
answer
to
this
inquiry
was
yes
then
indeed
we
would
reject
the
application
and
recommend
against
submission.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
if
the
purpose
was
to
seek
not
the
conduct
of
the
police
officer
but
rather
his
political
beliefs
and
views,
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
inappropriate.
this
court
has
almost
an
unbroken
chain
of
precedence
saying
that
belief
is
absolute
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
would
submit
that
in
any
situations
except
those
involving
absolute
discretion
would
be
a
point
to
uphold
the
public
service.
the
beliefs
or
brainwaves
of
an
individual
are
not
the
concerned
or
the
business
of
the
state.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
case
really
is
controlled
by
speiser
versus
randall.
in
that
case
where
a
tax
exemption
was
depended
upon
the
execution
of
an
affidavit
stating
that
the
applicant
did
not
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government,
this
court
inferred
in
holding
that
that
denial
of
the
tax
exemption
was
unconstitutional.
that
there
was
a
frank
aim
at
suppressing
dangerous
ideas
and
therefore
it
was
unconstitutional.
we
say
that
our
case
is
even
stronger,
the
right
to
practice
law
which
has
been
described
by
this
court
as
far
back
as
1867
as
a
right
is
much
more
precious
than
a
tax
exemption.
in
our
case
we
need
not
infer
an
assault
upon
political
belief,
it
is
frankly
out
in
front
of
us
by
the
expressed
statement
and
very
candid
mission
of
the
committee.
the
affect
upon
holding
that
belief
is
a
valid
subject
of
inquiry
for
the
state
bar
or
for
any
other
government
institution
seems
to
be
involved
in
a
tremendous
amount
of
deterrence,
of
thought
control.
of
perjury
problems
if
the
person
is
under
oath
as
to
how
do
you
known
whether
an
individual
is
telling
the
truth
with
respect
to
matters
of
the
mind,
i
guess
one
of
our
basic
points
in
this
area
was
made
in
1867
in
ex
parte
garland
where
a
former
confederate
member
of
the
confederate
core
sought
to
be
a
lawyer
and
was
barred
because
he
could
not
take
the
oath
of
office
required
of
him.
this
court
and
holding
that
to
be
a
bill
of
attainder
said
that
the
right
to
practice
law
can
only
be
deprived
of
by
misconduct
consisting
of
moral
or
professional
delinquency.
this
point
was
also
referred
in
schware
v.
board
of
bar
examiners
where
it
was
noticed
that
it
would
be
important
that
the
petitioner
there
actually
participated
in
some
unlawful
conduct.
we
believe
that
disbarment
in
the
criminal
law
sanctions
are
sufficient
to
present
any
sort
of
threat
which
is
posed
by
ones
mind.
in
function,
this
question
27
is
really
a
test
oath
because
it
is
not
a
conduct.
it
is
not
asked
for
the
purpose
of
finding
out
whether
an
individual
engaged
in
unlawful
conduct.
it
is
asked
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
finding
out
whether
one
has
an
intent
which
is
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
as
to
political
beliefs
and
religious
beliefs
in
particular
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
well
now
i
can
see
that
you
might
say
that
a
bar
examination
is
to
test
ones
thought
processes
of
some
sort
because
it
goes
to
competency.
i
don't
believe
that
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
think
it
may
be
relevant
mr.
justice
stewart
but
i
don't
believe
that
relevancy
in
this
situation
can
be
the
subject
for
can
be
the
substitute
for
a
constitutional
ban
which
i
understand
under
the
holdings
of
this
court.
if
belief
is
absolute
as
we
said
in
cantwell
v.
connecticut.
if
use
of
the
individual
are
in
violent,
then
i
submit
that
it
cannot
be
in
violate
in
some
instances
or
absolute
in
other
instances.
take
the
situation
of
a
lawyer
where
he
believes
very
strongly
in
opposing
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
he
opposes
brown
versus
board
of
education.
he
has
a
state
of
mind
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
following
of
the
mandates
of
this
court
and
of
the
constitution.
one
could
say
that
is
relevant
because
it
maybe
transposed
into
conduct
which
would
obstruct
equality
and
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
in
so
far
as
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
in
so
far
as
that
is
a
thought
process
and
does
not
approach
action,
then
i
say
that,
"yes,
that
is
protected
just
the
same
as
a
belief
of
declaring
or
fighting
wars
without
congressional
declaration."
i
think
there
are
sort
of
thought
which
are
inconsistent
which
if
transposed
into
conduct
post
enormous
threats
to
the
security
of
the
united
states
but
the
converse,
the
choice
is
opening
a
wedge
into
a
freedom
of
a
mans
mind.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
not
into
his
mind,
into
his
background,
his
conduct,
his
character
but
not
into
his
mind
mr.
justice
stewart
because
you
could
ask
that
kind
of
question
in
any
sort
of
a
context.
with
respect
to
any
kind
of
belief
which
means
some
bar
committee
must
have
a
valued
judgment
in
mind
as
to
what
is
good
belief
and
what
is
bad
belief
and
as
i
understand
the
flag
salute
case
in
west
virginia
v.
barnette
this
court
said
that
no
official
hire
pity
has
the
right
to
prescribe
what
is
orthodox
in
politics,
religion
or
matters
of
the
conscience
and
a
mans
mind
really
is
a
very
--very
highly
protected
right.
in
the
abstract
or
in
the
concrete
either
way
and
it
is
our
contention
that
this
kind
of
a
question
which
is
aimed
at
belief
can
be
sharply
contrasted
from
the
oath
which
the
petitioner
is
seeking
to
take.
the
oath
of
office
which
is
sanctioned
in
arizona
by
the
rules
of
this
court
and
by
the
constitution
to
support
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
she
is
willing
to
do
this
and
that
is
an
oath
that
is
not
broken
by
thought,
it
is
an
oath
which
is
broken
by
conduct
for
unlawful
conduct.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
mr.
justice
white
i
first
of
all
say
that
isn't
the
case
here
but
i
do
wish
to
meet
your
point
which
is
when
you
move
from
the
area
of
belief.
the
continuum
into
conduct
and
the
closer
you
come
to
conduct
the
more
likely
i
am
to
say
that
the
bar
committee
has
every
right
to
examine
that
conduct
and
make
it's
determination
as
to
whether
it
indicates
moral
turpitude
or
bad
moral
character.
i
would
say
that
if
an
individual
belongs
to
the
communist
party
or
some
very
unpopular
organization
such
as
that
or
take
it
on
the
right
side
of
the
spectrum
of
the
minute
man
or
whatever.
but
that
person,
until
he
actually
violates
the
law
by
his
conduct,
i
do
not
believe
that
he
should
be
denied
the
right
to
practice
law.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
in
our
case,
i
say
yes.
we
have
answered
every
organization
to
which
the
petitioner
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
on
the
basis
of
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
well
that
brings
--
well
i
think
that
probably
is
closer
to
the
facts
of
the
case
which
will
follow
us
than
ours
but
i
would
say
that
as
in
so
far
as
konigsberg
and
anastaplo
state
the
law
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
as
she
did
must
answer
a
question
asking
for
the
name
of
an
organization.
she
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
you
mean
if
she's
already
a
lawyer?
mr.
peter
d.
baird
if
i
follow
you
right,
yes.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
where
is
her
answer?
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
do
not
believe
it
is
mr.
justice
black.
i
don't
think
that
the
committee
entered
that
into
evidence
before
the
arizona
supreme
court
so
it's
not
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
do
not
think
so;
i
do
not
recall
that
that
is
actually
part
of
the
record.
all
i
know
is
that
we
alleged
that
she
fully
and
fairly
answered
the
question
and
that
there
is
no
--
did
they
say
she
answered
25?
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
no,
she
has
not
been
accused
of
not
answering
question
25.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
since
she's
16,
under
konigsberg
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
i
think
so.
we
alleged
in
our
verified
petition
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
that
this
question
was
answered
fully
and
truthfully
and
this
was
not
really
denied
at
all.
it
has
been,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
committee
has
stated
in
its
position
before
the
arizona
supreme
court
that
the
only
reason
that
they
are
keeping
the
petitioner
from
practice
law
is
her
refusal
to
answer
question
27
thus
clearly
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
well
because
question
27
asks
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
think
the
purpose
for
the
question
is
that
--
well
the
answer
is
that
she
had
answered
question
25,
so
in
far
that
as
they
would
need
that
information
to
find
references
to
investigate
petitioners
background
and
conduct,
they
can
get
it
because
they
have
all
of
the
groups
to
which
she
belonged.
they
can
use
that
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
pardon
me?
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
can't
remember,
but
in
so
far
that
is
a
valid
purpose
they
can
use
the
answer
to
question
25
and
find
these
references.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
think
the
girl
scouts
was
one
of
them,
was
on
that
list.
in
so
far
there's
a
valid
purpose,
it
could
be
served
by
her
answer
to
question
25
because
she
was
probably
required
under
konigsberg
and
anastaplo
to
answer
a
question
asking
for
membership
because
there
is
a
possible
valid
purpose
but
to
ask
question
27
having
already
answered
question
25.
they
needed
now
to
investigate
ones
beliefs
and
it
is
our
position
here
that
beliefs
are
not
a
legitimate
subject
for
inquiry.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
no,
it
really
isn't
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
it
is
a
different
question
because
question
27
asks
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
well
yes
and
so
far
it's
a
communist
party
is
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
as
well
as
asking
whether
in
affect
are
any
of
those
organizations
you
listed
in
response
to
question
25.
is
anyone
of
them
--
does
anyone
of
them
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence?
this
does
bring
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
that
is
correct;
it
has
been
supplemented
by
the
committee,
apparently
coming
forward
as
it
must
on
your
naccp
versus
alabama
to
come
forward
with
a
compelling
state
interest
to
move
in
to
the
area
of
freedom
of
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
think
that
the
reading
of
brief
of
the
respondent
that
the
text
of
their
answer
has
changed
somewhat.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
think
you
should
probably
ask
them
but
i
submit
that
it
should
be
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
no,
i
would
not.
i
think
that
it
should
be
the
committee's
answer
which
was
presented
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
which
ruled
on
the
basis
of
that
memorandum
of
points
and
authorities
thereby
presumably
adopting
the
position
of
the
committee
because
i
had
no
opinion.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
you
mean
that
you
would
just
ignore
the
political
belief
point
and
move
into
some
other
substantive
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
think
that
as
i
understand
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
understand
the
appellate
procedure
it
is
the
general
rule
that
you
must
present
the
issues
to
the
lower
court
as
a
normal
matter
before
they
can
be
presented
here.
however
this
is
certainly
under
the
digression
of
this
court
to
waive,
i'm
sure.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
our
claims
are
first
amendment
as
well
as
fifth
amendment.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
--
i
would
say
that
in
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
yes
because
before
the
arizona
supreme
court,
the
attack
was
clearly
on
political
belief.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
apparently
but
that
statement
is
a
far
cry
from
the
statement
that
the
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
--
committee
stated
before
the
arizona
supreme
court.
it
said
that
it
would
lead
to
an
investigation
as
to
whether
or
not
the
applicant
presently
entertains
the
view
and
if
so
then
they
would
reject
the
application.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
submit
that
it
should
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
issue
as
was
presented
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
for
their
decision.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
i
do.
i
read
the
committee's
statement
as
still
encompassing
belief
because
it
says
actively
believe
i
still
say
that
that
refers
to
her
beliefs
as
i
suppose
to
and
spouses
that
at
the
greatest
extent
would
involve
speech
and
that
does
not
come
close
to
the
brandenburg
decision
this
court
annunciated
just
last
term
where
it
said
that
"you
must
espouse
directed
toward
action
and
is
likely
to
produce
action
of
an
imminent
violent
sort
or
something
to
that
nature",
which
is
really
again
a
far
cry
from
this
statement
by
the
committee.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
that
is
absolutely
correct;
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
assume
so,
yes.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
think
so,
in
konigsberg
and
anastopalo,
they
did
not
answer
the
question
with
respect
to
their
associations
and
it
seemed
to
be
final
and
schneider
versus
smith
where
the
merchant
marine
applicant
was
involved.
he
refused
to
answer
questions
at
that
time,
if
he
had
answered
them
i
suppose
that
could've
disposed
of
the
case.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
no.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
suppose
so.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
that
is
true.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
well
because
i
don't
believe
that
the
committee
can
require
and
answer
to
an
unconstitutional
question
which
is
posed
to
seek
out
political
belief,
to
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
the
question
requires
her
to
make
a
judgment
and
the
burden
presumably
is
upon
her
to
see
whether
they
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
this
requires
her
to
deal
and
grapple
with
the
issues
of
the
smith
act
and
that
kind
of
a
burden
was
specifically
condemned
in
speiser
v.
randall
where
it
said
that
the
burden
in
this
area
should
not
be
applied
on
the
person
who
seeks
a
tax
exemption.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
this
is
--
yes
it
is
because
it
would
make
one
very
much
less
likely
to
join
an
organization
if
he
has
to
always
make
judgments
as
to
whether
that
organization
advocates,
and
if
he
misses
in
his
judgment
as
to
whether
that
organization
advocates,
he
could
be
prosecuted
for
perjury,
i
probably
wouldn't
stand
up
but
he
could
be
prosecuted,
this
is
under
oath.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
if
she
answers
the
question
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
unless
she
answers
the
question
she
will
not
be
admitted
to
the
bar.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
it
does.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
i
think
that
there
probably
would
be.
the
very
last
point
is
our
fifth
amendment
argument
and
this
is
simply
to
the
effect
that
if
an
answer
is
required
and
if
the
answer
were
yes
it
would
be
an
incriminating
circumstance
and
a
link
in
the
chain.
if
spivack
versus
klein
is
to
be
applied
to
the
bar
admission
area
as
oppose
to
the
disbarment
area.
that
seems
to
us
that
logically
petitioner
would
be
able
to
be
a
member
of
the
bar
of
arizona
solely
and
entirely
upon
the
fifth
amendment.
we
respectfully
request
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
be
reversed.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
one
minute
i'll
take.
i
would
like
to
respond
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
about
the
fifth
amendment.
it
was
raised
in
a
letter
to
mr.
wilmer
and
the
committee
and
this
is
part
of
the
record.
it
is
in
june
27,
1968
in
a
form
of
a
letter
were
spevack
versus
klein
was
discussed
and
there
was
a
memorandum
attached
to
that
where
the
application
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
bar
admission
process
was
discussed
and
mr.
wilmer's
brief
that
there
was
a
statement
that
she
did
not
assert
the
right
of
self-incrimination
but
this
is
in
a
letter
dated
july
31,
1969.
mr.
wilmer
sent
to
mr.
davis,
the
clerk
of
this
court
stating
that
that
was
an
incorrect
statement
that
in
fact
she
had
asserted
the
privilege.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
pardon
me.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
against
self
incrimination,
the
fifth
amendment
right.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
by
literal
reading
at
the
smith
act
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
answered
question
25.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
because
we
were
required
mr.
justice
white
under
konigsberg
and
anastaplo
to
answer
that
question
which
called
for
the
names
of
organizations.
she
was
specifically
directed
by
the
mandate
in
those
cases
we
believe
to
answer
that
kind
of
a
question.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
not
at
that
point
at
all,
no.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
because
i
think
konigsberg
and
anastaplo
required
the
pain
of
being
a
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
no,
i
believe
the
first
part
with
respect
to
the
name
of
the
communist
party,
she
does
not
have
that
right
however
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
under
konigsberg
and
anastaplo.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
would
say
we
cannot
stand
on
that
particular
basis
before
this
court
because
of
our
answer
to
question
25.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
we
are
asserting
the
privilege
to
question
27
which
requires
us
to
make
a
determination
of
other
groups
in
that
category
that
she
has
already
listed.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i,
its
both.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
well,
there
may
be
other
groups
mr.
justice
white
such
as
i
can
maybe
the
sts
is
considered
subversive,
maybe
they
are
in
response
to
another
question.
maybe
there
are
other
organizations
which
she
can
draw
the
line
on
and
question
27
is.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
well,
it
in
effect
would
have
that
practical
result,
yes.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
arizona
supreme
court.
it
involves
the
refusal
to
admit
sara
baird
to
the
practice
of
law.
sara
baird,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
graduated
from
stanford
law
school.
she
has
passed
the
bar
examination
and
there’s
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
she
fails
or
lacks
to
have
good
moral
character
and
the
exclusion
of
her
or
the
refusal
to
process
her
application
stands
entirely
from
the
questionnaire
and
affidavit
submitted
to
the
applicants
to
practice
law
in
arizona.
there
are
two
questions
on
that
questionnaire
and
affidavit
which
are
involved
in
this
case.
question
25
requests
the
bar
applicant
to
list
all
organizations,
associations
and
clubs
of
which
you
are
or
had
been
a
member
since
attaining
the
age
of
16
years.
petitioner
complied
with
this
request
and
did
list
the
organizations
as
best
she
could
recall
and
at
the
last
argument
of
this
case,
the
record
was
supplemented
to
show
that
list.
question
27,
however,
is
the
one
petitioner
did
not
answer
and
that
asks
whether
“are
you
now
or
have
you
ever
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
any
organization
that
advocates
to
overthrow
the
united
states
government
by
force
or
violence.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
indeed
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
on
its
face,
it
request
the
applicant
to
make
some
sort
of
judgment
about
the
organizations
which
she
has
listed
in
response
to
question
25
and
it
is
supplemented
in
the
record
by
the
bar
committee
that
the
expressed
purpose
for
this
question
is
to
seek
out
an
orthodox
political
belief
that
the
bar
committee
has
told
us
and
it
is
in
the
record
that
the
basic
hypothesis
for
this
question
is
that
one
who
believes
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
cannot
practice
law
in
arizona.
the
question
is
framed
so
that
if
a
“yes”
answer
is
given
to
question
27,
there
will
be
triggered
and
investigation
and
interrogation
into
the
views
and
beliefs
of
the
applicant
and
the
committee
promises
without
equivocation
that
if
indeed
they
found
from
that
interrogation
and
investigation
that
the
bar
applicant
believed
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government,
that
would
be
sufficient
to
exclude
her
from
the
practice
of
law
or
any
other
applicant.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
belief
alone.
they
are
not
requesting
here
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
that’s
correct.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
belief
alone
is
sufficient
in
order
for
the
committee
to
exclude
a
bar
applicant
and
we
submit
in
our
initial
and
most
important
basis
for
bringing
this
case
here
that
the
court
below
and
the
action
of
the
committee
violates
freedom
of
belief
as
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment.
we
submit
that
the
case
of
speiser
versus
randall
in
which
this
court
wrote
that
in
that
case
where
a
veterans’
tax
exemption
was
dependent
upon
the
execution
of
an
affidavit
proclaiming
non-advocacy
of
overthrow
of
the
government
that
this
court
said
that
kind
of
taxing
situation
was
frankly
aimed
at
the
suppression
of
unpopular
ideas.
our
case
is
even
stronger.
we
have
here
the
right
to
practice
law.
we
have
here
an
expressed
purpose
to
exclude
one
on
the
basis
of
the
views
which
they
may
hold
which
the
committee
seeks
to
obtain
and
speiser
versus
randall
stands
in
almost
unbroken
chain
of
precedent
according
the
essential
right
or
freedom
to
believe
as
one
will
the
utmost
to
protection.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
i
would
say
that
if
you
get
into
the
area
of
political
belief
or
religious
belief
alone
that
the
policeman
would
have
the
right
to
decline
to
answer
that
kind
of
question.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
if
in
fact,
the
record
discloses
that
he
has
(voice
overlap)
of
character
and
right.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
well,
i’m
not--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
would
say
that
he
has
the
same
kind
of
rights
as
the
lawyer
does
not
to
disclose
his
political
beliefs.
i
don’t
know
how
the
right
to
be
a
policeman
maybe
characterized
differently
from
the
right
to
practice
law.
this
court
has
said
that
there
is
a
right
to
practice
law
and
i’m
not
aware
that
this
made
as
similar
pronouncement
as
to
a
right
to
be
a
policeman
but
i
would
say
that
he
would
in
those
circumstances
have
a
right
to
hold
his
political
beliefs
and
violate
and
as
to
whether
or
not
he
has
the
expressed
right
to
become
a
policeman,
i
daresay,
i’m
not
entirely
sure
on
that
point
wholly
apart
from
fifth
amendment
considerations
in
that
sort.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
i
should
think
so.
and
we
take
the
view
which
is
contrary
to
our
opponent
that
the
first
amendment
should
apply
to
teachers
and
to
lawyers
and
to
postman
and
policeman
as
well
as
we
feel
that
it
does
in
this
case
and
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
d.
baird
no
i’m
not
saying
they
are
identical
and
if
i’m
not
correct
in
the
breadths
of
my
statements
with
respect
to
the
application
of
first
amendment,
i
don’t
think
that
the
fact
that
there’s
no
exclusion
of
a
police
officer
should
necessarily
dictate
the
exclusion
of
a
bar
applicant.
the
entire
force
of
the
chain
of
cases
according
to
freedom
of
belief,
this
kind
of
utmost
protection
really
stands
from
an
--
really
a
historical
repugnance
to
the
kind
of
test
those
that
we
have
had
throughout
the
common
law
for
hundred
of
years.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
yes.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
in
ex
parte
garland,
the
supreme
court,
they
are
facing
the
exclusion
of
a
former
confederate
officer
because
he
could
not
take
oath
prescribed
for
him
said
that
to
practice
law
was
a
right
and
it’s
at
page,
i
believe
379,
they
said
that
there
is
a
right
to
practice
law
and
it
can
be
deprived
only
for
misconduct
consisting
of
moral
or
professional
delinquency
and
we
submit
the
same
exact
proposition
that
once
misconduct
should
indeed
be
the
basis
for
excluding
one
or
for
disbarring
one
but
certainly
not
his
political
beliefs.
and
we
draw
as
a
corollary
of
this
argument
that
there
is
no
committee
at
least
in
so
far
as
the
practice
of
law
is
concerned
which
should
be
able
to
say
what
beliefs
lawyers
can
have
and
what
beliefs
lawyers
cannot
have
because
we
feel
that
the
expression
of
this
court
in
west
virginia
versus
barnette,
a
flag
salute
case
that
no
official,
high
or
petty,
or
an
institution
can
prescribed
what’s
orthodox
in
matters
of
politics
and
conscience
and
religion.
but
even
more
than
freedom
of
belief
is
involve
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
there
is
also
another
first
amendment
argument
which
would
rest
on
freedom
of
association.
we
have
answered
question
25.
we
have
given
the
list
of
the
names
and
the
organizations
but
the
committee
is
not
content
with
that
and
wishes
to
take
the
process
a
step
further.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
she
has
absolutely.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
question
27,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
no.
well,
on
its
face
it’s
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
a
cause
for
some
kind
of
judgment
on
her
part
under
the
smith
act
perhaps
as
to--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
and
then
there
was
an
exclusion
because
if
the
answer
had
been
“yes”
and
if
then
they
tried
to
interrogate
her
about
her
beliefs,
perhaps
it
would
but
i
think
we
would
have
been
surrendering
a
great
deal
not
only
our
fifth
but
fourteenth
and
perhaps
even
fifth
amendment
rights.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
but
in
konigsberg
and
anastaplo,
the
person
was
not
--
did
not
answer
the
question
and
this
court
felt
that
it
was
ripe
enough
for
a
decision
to
be
rendered
on
whether
or
not
there
was
a
final
case
and
whether
or
not
the
issue
had
presented
but
even
apart
from
that,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
this
court
has
continuously
in
this
area
of
freedom
of
belief
and
association
require
the
state
to
come
forward
with
a
compelling
and
controlling
state
interest
for
an
encroachment
into
the
freedom
of
association
or
belief
area.
and
we
submit
that
the
purpose
advanced
by
the
committee
which
in
this
case
is
to
seek
out
the
beliefs
of
the
applicant
is
neither
controlling
nor
is
a
compelling
and
we
submit
that
it
is
not
even
constitutional.
and
we
believe
that
the
area
of
for
example
the
congressional
investigation
area,
this
court
has
held
that
you
have
a
right
and
a
duty
to
comply
with
the
investigatorial
apparatus
for
the
government
to
seek
out
facts
but
you
have
a
right
to
draw
a
line
on
questions
which
seek
to
abridge
first
amendment
freedom
such
as
belief.
we
submit
that
in
this
case,
solely
in
the
first
amendment,
there
is
a
right
to
draw
a
line
on
a
question
which
is
aimed
for
this
purpose
and
this
purpose
alone
and
in
terms
of
the
freedom
of
association,
if
in
fact
it
is
a
deterrent
for
a
person
to
list
the
names
of
his
organizations
such
as
the
teacher
in
shelton
versus
tucker.
it
should
be
even
more
deterring
to
an
individual
not
simply
to
be
able
to
list
them
but
to
have
to
characterized
them
under
the
smith
act
to
be
threatened
within
interrogation
and
investigation
and
to
beliefs
if
the
answer
is
“yes”
and
then
to
be
threatened
with
the
exclusions
solely
upon
the
beliefs
of
the
applicant.
we
submit
that
this
is
in
fact
the
deterrence
and
would
fall
within
the
line
of
cases
under
shelton
versus
tucker
and
in
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
that
is
ex
parte
garland.
it’s
an
old
case.
its
1867,
we
cited
on
page
17
of
our
brief
and
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
that
is
correct.
the
two
cases
which
are
very
much
in
this
area
are
of
course
the
konigsberg
and
anastaplo
decisions.
we
submit
that
the
line
was
drawn
in
both
of
those
cases
with
respect
to
freedom
of
belief
because
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
no,
i
do
not
think
so
because
it
would
have
been
a
sanction
of
the
purpose
of
the
committee
which
is
to
seek
out
the
political
belief
of
the
applicants
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
think
in
the
brief
filed
before
this
court,
the
committee
has
said
an
“i
don’t
know
answer”
would
be
acceptable
to
them.
but
if
in
fact
the
committee’s
need
for
data
is
so
strong
and
“i
don’t
know
answer”
may
not
--
just
i
do
not
understand
how
it
could
be
sufficient
under
the
circumstances.
however,
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
she
did
not
answer
question
27.
she
listed
the
words
“not
applicable.”
mr.
peter
d.
baird
that’s
correct.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
well,
that
seems
to
me
was
part
of
the
record
before
the
arizona
supreme
court
and
that
constitutionally
this
question
could
not
be
answered
up
for
and
an
answer
to
it
is
not
required
under
the
first,
fourteenth
and
fifth
amendments
as
were
submitted
below.
we
contend
that
under
konigsberg
and
anastaplo,
justice
harlan
was
careful
at
least
it
appears
to
us
that
he
was
careful
in
pointing
out
that
speiser
versus
randall
did
not
apply
to
those
cases
because
there
was
no
intent
to
penalized
political
belief
in
the
konigsberg
case.
and
we
submit
that,
that
sharply
distinguishes
that
case
from
ours
because
there
is
here
and
the
record
is
replete
with
evidence
where
there
is
an
attack
on
political
belief.
finally,
we
find
that
the
decision
below
thus
violate
due
process
because
we
submit
that
it
is
arbitrary
in
using
a
question
such
of
this
nature
for
finding
out
the
political
beliefs
of
the
applicants
particularly
where
the
committee
does
not
request
the
purpose
for
this
as
seeking
a
conduct.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
d.
baird
well,
it
could
--
if
in
fact
they
have
a
right
to
ask
the
question
then
i
would
say
and
if
i’m
wrong
and
all
of
the
points
that
i’m
presenting
here
in
my
brief,
i
guess
in
fact
you
could
say
that
it’s
not
arbitrary
because
i
would
lose
on
the
points
of
law
that
i’m
submitting
to
you.
it
is
my
position
that
it
is
arbitrary
to
seek
out
political
belief
because
it
really
does
not
have
that
close,
a
nexus
or
a
relationship
with
ones
performance
as
a
lawyer.
for
example,
take
the
ardent,
hard-core
racist
who
is
in
his
mind
though
he
is
never
translated
it
into
conduct.
he
disbelieves
in
equal
protection
clause,
he
disbelieves
in
brown
versus
board
of
education,
he
disbelieves
with
as
many
as
venal
facts
as
he
possibly
can.
i
submit
that
that
man
has
a
right
to
practice
law.
he
has
a
right
to
practice
law
just
as
much
as
the
person
who
has
an
apparent
left-wing
belief
because
it
is
the
point
made
in
ex
parte
garland
that
you
judge
a
man
by
his
conduct.
if
in
fact
he
translates
these
venal
facts
into
conduct
that
is
repugnant
to
the
united
states
constitution
and
the
equal
protection
clause
then
he
should
be
excluded
at
the
gate
or
he
should
be
disbarred.
but
the
mere
holding
of
a
belief
will
by
anybody
standards
depend
on
their
own
subjective
point
of
view.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
if
in
fact
as
i
say
mr.
justice
black,
if
i
lose
then
it
won’t
be
arbitrary
and
they
will
be
able
to
ask
the
question.
it
is
our
further
point
that
this
has
an
intimidation
effect.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
if
in
fact
there
is
an
intimidating
effect
that
we
would
submit
that
if
in
fact
the
committee
on
examination
send
admissions
can
seek
out
the
beliefs
of
the
bar
applicants
and
if
in
fact
that
can
be
the
basis
for
their
exclusion
then
it
seems
to
us
that
there
may
well
be
an
intimidating
effect
upon
lawyers
to
speak
their
minds,
upon
lawyers
to
join
organizations
they
wish
and
perhaps
even
to
represent
unpopular
and
repudiated
points
of
view.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
that
would
be
first.
so,
we
also
feel
that
it
has
certain
arbitrariness
because
it
produces
a
result
which
would
be
counterproductive
to
at
least
a
maintenance
of
a
free
bar
which
would
be
free
to
speak
and
to
represent
as
they
will.
not
free
however
to
engage
in
bombing
or
misconduct
but
free
to
think
and
to
act
and
to
join
and
so
far
as
the
law
permits.
finally,
we
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes.
you
reach
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
you
reach
the
belief
problem.
we
say
that
it
is
arguable
on
the
face
on
the
question
that
a
cause
for
some
kind
of
belief
about
the
organization.
it’s
an
arguable
point.
but
we
reach
the
belief
problem
because
on
the
first
amendment
area,
this
court
has
said
to
the
states,
you
are
in
the
first
amendment
area,
come
forth
with
a
kind
of
compelling
and
controlling
state
interest
that
you
must
have
to
proceed
in
this
first
amendment
area.
and
in
this
case,
the
committee
has
come
forward
and
said,
our
compelling
and
controlling
state
interest
is
to
seek
out
the
beliefs
of
those
who
will
answer
that
question,
“yes”.
those
who
we
deem
to
be
dangerous
because
of
their
beliefs
and
once
the
question
has
a
purpose
of
that
nature,
we
feel
that
under
the
first
amendment,
that
question
need
not
be
ask
in
naacp
versus
button,
the
questions
ask
there
to
bring
forth
a
membership
list.
the
court
requested
that
the
purpose
for
that
question
be
made
clear
and
upon
examining
that
purpose,
this
court
found
it
was
not
sufficient
in
order
to
permit
an
encroachment
and
enter
the
freedom
of
association
area.
so
we
say
on
the
face
on
the
question
as
well
as
the
clear
record
supplemented
by
the
committee
on
examinations
admissions,
we
do
reach
the
belief
issue
and
reach
it
on
a
very
significant
way
because
they
promise
to
exclude
on
the
basis
of
belief.
finally,
we
make
the
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
exclude.
they
are
going
to
inquire
further
and
then
they
are
going
to
exclude
if
in
fact
that
belief
is
unacceptable
to
them
and
we
say
that
they
do
not
have
the
power
to
design
and
ask
a
question
of
bar
applicants
if
the
only
purpose
they
have
is
to
get
at
the
beliefs
of
the
individual
applicants
because
that
is
not
a
part
of
their
jurisdictional
domain.
it
is
not
permissible
under
the
first
amendment
and
there
is
a
further
issue
in
this
case
and
it
does
involve
the
fifth
amendment.
question
27
calls
for
an
incriminating
answer.
if
the
answer
given
were
yes,
it
would
take
the
applicant
directly
into
the
heartland
of
a
smith
act.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment
in
this
case
does
not
necessarily
depend
upon
the
answer
given
rather
it
hinges
upon
the
question
and
the
nature
of
the
question
as
a
matter
of
law.
if
in
fact
one
need
not
show
an
actual
hazard
before
invoking
the
fifth
amendment
in
an
area
pervaded
with
criminal
statutes
such
as
this
and
if
in
fact
the
innocent
as
well
as
the
guilty
may
claim
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
as
has
been
said
by
this
court.
and
if
in
fact
the
good
faith
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
as
this
court
said
in
united
states
versus
covington
usually
one
of
law,
then
we
submit
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
one
may
read
question
27
and
one
may
validly
invoke
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
on
the
basis
of
the
question
alone.
we
contend
that
logically
under
the
force
of
spevack
versus
klein,
one
cannot
exclude
a
bar
applicant
by
refusing
to
comply
with
something
that
has
an
incriminating
effect.
there
is
no
logical
distinction
between
a
disbarment
proceeding
and
an
exclusion
from
the
bar
and
i
think
that
point
was
made
invalidly
so
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
his
dissent
in
that
case.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
under
this
argument
that
is
correct.
we
however,
would
answer
a
question
that
related
to
conduct
however
that
is
not
to
concede
--
but
that
is
not
to
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
that’s
true.
however,
we
would
not
concede
that
spevack
versus
klein
does
not
apply
to
bar
admissions
and
there
is
really
--
spevack
does
have
a
logical
import
to
it
that
would
carry
you
from
the
disbarment
situation
to
the
exclusion
situation
at
the
door.
so,
we
would
con
--
in
conclusion,
we
submit
the
sara
baird
that
should
be
made
a
lawyer
and
that
the
area
of
freedom
of
belief
remain
inviolate.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
25.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
submit
mr.
chief
justice,
that
by
answering
question
25
in
trying
to
comply
with
the
committee
with
the
question
on
its
face
which
has
no
either
incriminating
purpose
or
has
no
purpose
to
seek
out
some
unorthodox
point
of
view
or
something
of
that
nature
that
petitioner
did
consent
to
answer
that
question
to
help
the
committee
if
in
fact
it
wanted
help.
but
question
27
is
not
just
a
blend
or
general
list
of
all
your
organizations,
it
has
written
right
across
it
that
there
is
right
answer
and
a
wrong
answer
and
that
you’re
supposed
to
make
a
judgment
about
these
organizations
you
list
in
question
25
that
you
pointed
out.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
question
25
requested
that
the
petitioner
list
all
organizations
to
which
she
has
belong
since
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
since
age
16
and
then
she
refused
to
answer
the
further
question,
question
27
which
went
into
whether
it’s
a
communist
party
or
any
subversive
organization
and
she
says
that
by
answering
question
25
and
listing
the
name
of
an
organization,
she
does
not
waive
her
right
to
draw
the
line
on
a
question
that
requires
her
to
characterize
whether
this
happen
to
be
a
subversive
organization
and
she
doesn’t
waive
her
right
to
resist
the
question
which
now
we
have
been
told
without
any
equivocation
is
aimed
at
seeking
out
theoretical
or
an
unorthodox
political
belief
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
question
27
said,
“are
you
now
or
have
you
ever
been
a
member
of
a
communist
party
or
any
organization
that
advocates
overthrow
of
the
united
states
government?”
mr.
peter
d.
baird
no,
no
that
was
it.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
no,
that
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
it
does
to
this
extent,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
the
committee
had
come
out
and
told
us
that
the
purpose
for
question
25
is
the
same
purpose
as
it
is
in
question
27,
and
that
is
to
find
out
those
who
are
a
member
of
the
republican
party
and
they
would
screen
out
those
who
hold
republican
beliefs.
i
would
say
she
would
have
the
same
right
to
not
answer
that
question
as
she
has
to
refuse
to
answer
question
27.
question
27
is
significantly
different,
it
asked
her
to
make
a
judgment
under
the
smith
act
or
under
whatever
kind
of
substantive
principle
she
must
to
see
whether
these
are
organizations
which
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
united
states
government
by
force
and
violence.
and
on
its
face,
it
has
the
suggestion
that
they
are
after
political
belief
and
that
doubt
was
a
resolve
when
the
committee
has
now
told
us
indeed.
it
is
to
find
out
what
her
beliefs
are
but
i
don’t
think
that
you
can
say
that
there
is
a
waiver
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
she
listed
in
question
25
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
no,
she
has
already
listed
that
she
belonged
to
the
young
democrats
and
the
young
republicans
but
what
they
want
to
know
is
whether
she
believes
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
and
we
submit
--
by
force
and
violence,
that’s
correct
and
we
submit
that
they
could
ask
whether
do
you
believe
in
the
equal
protection
clause
and
whether
you
believe
in
complying
with
the
orders
of
this
court.
the
beliefs
of
a
right
wing,
of
a
left
wing,
of
a
middle
of
the
road
are
really
inviolate
we
submit.
and
when
the
purpose
is
such,
as
it
is
here
to
seek
out
beliefs
to
use
that
as
a
trigger
to
an
inquiry
and
to
beliefs,
then
that
question
is
on
its
face
and
it
has
been
supplemented
on
the
record
by
the
committee
not
worth
answering.
so
we
again
submit
that
sara
baird
should
practice
law.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
peter
baird
and
i
represent
petitioner
and
this
cause.
the
case
before
you
is
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
and
it
concerns
a
refusal
to
admit
petitioner
to
the
practice
of
law
in
arizona.
she
has
graduated
from
stanford
law
school,
she
has
passed
the
bar
examination
and
the
refusal
stands
upon
her
refusal
to
completely
fill
out
a
questionnaire
and
affidavit
prescribed
by
the
arizona
rules
of
the
supreme
court
of
arizona.
there
are
two
particular
questions
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
first
is
the
question
she
did
answer
and
this
was
question
25
and
we
set
it
for
on
page
three
of
our
brief.
this
is
and
i
quote,
"list
all
organizations,
associations
and
clubs
other
than
bar
associations
of
which
you
are
or
have
been
a
member
since
attaining
the
age
of
16
years."
this
petitioner
did,
she
listed
each
and
every
organization
to
which
she
has
belonged.
the
next
question
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
do
not
have
as
part
of
the
record
the
answers
to
the
questions.
that
is
part
of
the
committees’
files
and
they
were
not
introduced
so
far
as
i
know
before
at
the
supreme
court.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
we
alleged
that
in
our
verified
petition
before
the
arizona
supreme
court
and
so
far
as
i
know
this
was
not
denied
and
the
refusal
to
admit
petitioner
is
expressly
based
by
the
committee
upon
her
refusal
to
answer
question
27,
not
question
25.
question
27
reads
as
follows
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
that
is
true,
as
part
of
the
record
you
do
not
know
the
names
of
the
organizations
to
which
she
has
belong
which
she
did
list.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
her
question,
question
27
reads
"are
you
now
or
have
you
ever
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
any
organization
that
advocates,
overthrow
of
the
untied
states
government
by
force
or
violence."
there
is
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
would
say
mr.
chief
justice
that
really
is
two
questions,
one
which
overlaps
with
the
first
question
which
she
answered.
in
other
words
the
reference
to
communist
party
would
show
up
in
the
question
which
she
did
answer.
if
she
had
belonged
to
the
communist
party,
it
would
have
showed
up
in
response
to
question
25
and
there
is
no
contention
i
might
add
parenthetically
that
any
of
those
really
is
a
communist
party.
so
the
essence
of
her
refusal
goes
to
the
requirement
that
she
characterized.
the
group
she
belonged
to
and
listed
in
response
to
25
as
to
whether
they
do
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
we
do
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
that
is
not
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
no,
i
do
not
believe
it
do,
i
think
that
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
will
--
i
shall
do
it
right
now
as
a
matter
of
fact.
the
question
as
to
forcing
her
to
characterize
whether
any
of
the
groups
that
she
has
belonged
to
is
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
and
violence
requires
her
to
state
whether
under
the
smith
act
as
i
understand
it.
any
of
them
actually
does
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government.
now,
the
burden
upon
the
petitioner
is
significant
in
that
respect.
it
requires
her
to
make
various
value
judgments
under
the
smith
act
and
therefore
would
make
her
less
likely
to
join
these
organizations.
as
to
whether
membership
per
se,
in
this
kind
of
an
organization
is
unprotected
conduct,
i
think
that
under
the
decisions
in
elf
brown
and
perhaps
in
robel
that
one
must
actually
have
a
specific
content
to
overthrow
the
government.
be
an
active
member,
know
that
the
organization
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
and
share
that
purpose
before
that
association
or
status
maybe
proscribed.
the
most
significant
aspect
of
question
27
apart
from
the
freedom
of
association
aspect
is
the
purpose
for
which
question
27
is
asked
and
this
is
extremely
important
in
the
freedom
of
association
area
where
the
burden
in
not
upon
the
applicant
to
state
why
she
shouldn't
have
to
answer
it.
the
burden
is
shifted
to
the
state
to
come
forth
with
a
compelling
state
interest
to
say
why
she
should
answer
it.
the
compelling
state
interest
which
the
state
has
come
forward
with
in
this
case
and
presented
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
is
and
i
quote
as
follows.
"unless
we
are
to
conclude
that
one
who
truly
and
sincerely
believes
in
the
overthrow
of
the
united
states
government
by
force
and
violence
is
also
qualified
to
practice
laws
in
our
arizona
courts
that
an
answer
to
this
question
is
indeed
appropriate."
the
committee
again
emphasizes
that
a
mere
answer
of
yes
would
not
lead
to
an
automatic
rejection
of
an
application.
it
would
lead
to
an
investigation
and
interrogation
as
to
whether
the
applicant
presently
entertains
the
view
that
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
is
something
to
be
sought
to
be
sought
after.
if
the
answer
to
this
inquiry
was
yes
then
indeed
we
would
reject
the
application
and
recommend
against
submission.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
if
the
purpose
was
to
seek
not
the
conduct
of
the
police
officer
but
rather
his
political
beliefs
and
views,
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
inappropriate.
this
court
has
almost
an
unbroken
chain
of
precedence
saying
that
belief
is
absolute
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
would
submit
that
in
any
situations
except
those
involving
absolute
discretion
would
be
a
point
to
uphold
the
public
service.
the
beliefs
or
brainwaves
of
an
individual
are
not
the
concerned
or
the
business
of
the
state.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
case
really
is
controlled
by
speiser
versus
randall.
in
that
case
where
a
tax
exemption
was
depended
upon
the
execution
of
an
affidavit
stating
that
the
applicant
did
not
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government,
this
court
inferred
in
holding
that
that
denial
of
the
tax
exemption
was
unconstitutional.
that
there
was
a
frank
aim
at
suppressing
dangerous
ideas
and
therefore
it
was
unconstitutional.
we
say
that
our
case
is
even
stronger,
the
right
to
practice
law
which
has
been
described
by
this
court
as
far
back
as
1867
as
a
right
is
much
more
precious
than
a
tax
exemption.
in
our
case
we
need
not
infer
an
assault
upon
political
belief,
it
is
frankly
out
in
front
of
us
by
the
expressed
statement
and
very
candid
mission
of
the
committee.
the
affect
upon
holding
that
belief
is
a
valid
subject
of
inquiry
for
the
state
bar
or
for
any
other
government
institution
seems
to
be
involved
in
a
tremendous
amount
of
deterrence,
of
thought
control.
of
perjury
problems
if
the
person
is
under
oath
as
to
how
do
you
known
whether
an
individual
is
telling
the
truth
with
respect
to
matters
of
the
mind,
i
guess
one
of
our
basic
points
in
this
area
was
made
in
1867
in
ex
parte
garland
where
a
former
confederate
member
of
the
confederate
core
sought
to
be
a
lawyer
and
was
barred
because
he
could
not
take
the
oath
of
office
required
of
him.
this
court
and
holding
that
to
be
a
bill
of
attainder
said
that
the
right
to
practice
law
can
only
be
deprived
of
by
misconduct
consisting
of
moral
or
professional
delinquency.
this
point
was
also
referred
in
schware
v.
board
of
bar
examiners
where
it
was
noticed
that
it
would
be
important
that
the
petitioner
there
actually
participated
in
some
unlawful
conduct.
we
believe
that
disbarment
in
the
criminal
law
sanctions
are
sufficient
to
present
any
sort
of
threat
which
is
posed
by
ones
mind.
in
function,
this
question
27
is
really
a
test
oath
because
it
is
not
a
conduct.
it
is
not
asked
for
the
purpose
of
finding
out
whether
an
individual
engaged
in
unlawful
conduct.
it
is
asked
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
finding
out
whether
one
has
an
intent
which
is
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
as
to
political
beliefs
and
religious
beliefs
in
particular
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
well
now
i
can
see
that
you
might
say
that
a
bar
examination
is
to
test
ones
thought
processes
of
some
sort
because
it
goes
to
competency.
i
don't
believe
that
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
think
it
may
be
relevant
mr.
justice
stewart
but
i
don't
believe
that
relevancy
in
this
situation
can
be
the
subject
for
can
be
the
substitute
for
a
constitutional
ban
which
i
understand
under
the
holdings
of
this
court.
if
belief
is
absolute
as
we
said
in
cantwell
v.
connecticut.
if
use
of
the
individual
are
in
violent,
then
i
submit
that
it
cannot
be
in
violate
in
some
instances
or
absolute
in
other
instances.
take
the
situation
of
a
lawyer
where
he
believes
very
strongly
in
opposing
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
he
opposes
brown
versus
board
of
education.
he
has
a
state
of
mind
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
following
of
the
mandates
of
this
court
and
of
the
constitution.
one
could
say
that
is
relevant
because
it
maybe
transposed
into
conduct
which
would
obstruct
equality
and
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
in
so
far
as
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
in
so
far
as
that
is
a
thought
process
and
does
not
approach
action,
then
i
say
that,
"yes,
that
is
protected
just
the
same
as
a
belief
of
declaring
or
fighting
wars
without
congressional
declaration."
i
think
there
are
sort
of
thought
which
are
inconsistent
which
if
transposed
into
conduct
post
enormous
threats
to
the
security
of
the
united
states
but
the
converse,
the
choice
is
opening
a
wedge
into
a
freedom
of
a
mans
mind.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
not
into
his
mind,
into
his
background,
his
conduct,
his
character
but
not
into
his
mind
mr.
justice
stewart
because
you
could
ask
that
kind
of
question
in
any
sort
of
a
context.
with
respect
to
any
kind
of
belief
which
means
some
bar
committee
must
have
a
valued
judgment
in
mind
as
to
what
is
good
belief
and
what
is
bad
belief
and
as
i
understand
the
flag
salute
case
in
west
virginia
v.
barnette
this
court
said
that
no
official
hire
pity
has
the
right
to
prescribe
what
is
orthodox
in
politics,
religion
or
matters
of
the
conscience
and
a
mans
mind
really
is
a
very
--very
highly
protected
right.
in
the
abstract
or
in
the
concrete
either
way
and
it
is
our
contention
that
this
kind
of
a
question
which
is
aimed
at
belief
can
be
sharply
contrasted
from
the
oath
which
the
petitioner
is
seeking
to
take.
the
oath
of
office
which
is
sanctioned
in
arizona
by
the
rules
of
this
court
and
by
the
constitution
to
support
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
she
is
willing
to
do
this
and
that
is
an
oath
that
is
not
broken
by
thought,
it
is
an
oath
which
is
broken
by
conduct
for
unlawful
conduct.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
mr.
justice
white
i
first
of
all
say
that
isn't
the
case
here
but
i
do
wish
to
meet
your
point
which
is
when
you
move
from
the
area
of
belief.
the
continuum
into
conduct
and
the
closer
you
come
to
conduct
the
more
likely
i
am
to
say
that
the
bar
committee
has
every
right
to
examine
that
conduct
and
make
it's
determination
as
to
whether
it
indicates
moral
turpitude
or
bad
moral
character.
i
would
say
that
if
an
individual
belongs
to
the
communist
party
or
some
very
unpopular
organization
such
as
that
or
take
it
on
the
right
side
of
the
spectrum
of
the
minute
man
or
whatever.
but
that
person,
until
he
actually
violates
the
law
by
his
conduct,
i
do
not
believe
that
he
should
be
denied
the
right
to
practice
law.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
in
our
case,
i
say
yes.
we
have
answered
every
organization
to
which
the
petitioner
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
on
the
basis
of
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
well
that
brings
--
well
i
think
that
probably
is
closer
to
the
facts
of
the
case
which
will
follow
us
than
ours
but
i
would
say
that
as
in
so
far
as
konigsberg
and
anastaplo
state
the
law
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
as
she
did
must
answer
a
question
asking
for
the
name
of
an
organization.
she
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
you
mean
if
she's
already
a
lawyer?
mr.
peter
d.
baird
if
i
follow
you
right,
yes.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
where
is
her
answer?
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
do
not
believe
it
is
mr.
justice
black.
i
don't
think
that
the
committee
entered
that
into
evidence
before
the
arizona
supreme
court
so
it's
not
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
do
not
think
so;
i
do
not
recall
that
that
is
actually
part
of
the
record.
all
i
know
is
that
we
alleged
that
she
fully
and
fairly
answered
the
question
and
that
there
is
no
--
did
they
say
she
answered
25?
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
no,
she
has
not
been
accused
of
not
answering
question
25.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
since
she's
16,
under
konigsberg
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
i
think
so.
we
alleged
in
our
verified
petition
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
that
this
question
was
answered
fully
and
truthfully
and
this
was
not
really
denied
at
all.
it
has
been,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
committee
has
stated
in
its
position
before
the
arizona
supreme
court
that
the
only
reason
that
they
are
keeping
the
petitioner
from
practice
law
is
her
refusal
to
answer
question
27
thus
clearly
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
well
because
question
27
asks
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
think
the
purpose
for
the
question
is
that
--
well
the
answer
is
that
she
had
answered
question
25,
so
in
far
that
as
they
would
need
that
information
to
find
references
to
investigate
petitioners
background
and
conduct,
they
can
get
it
because
they
have
all
of
the
groups
to
which
she
belonged.
they
can
use
that
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
pardon
me?
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
can't
remember,
but
in
so
far
that
is
a
valid
purpose
they
can
use
the
answer
to
question
25
and
find
these
references.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
think
the
girl
scouts
was
one
of
them,
was
on
that
list.
in
so
far
there's
a
valid
purpose,
it
could
be
served
by
her
answer
to
question
25
because
she
was
probably
required
under
konigsberg
and
anastaplo
to
answer
a
question
asking
for
membership
because
there
is
a
possible
valid
purpose
but
to
ask
question
27
having
already
answered
question
25.
they
needed
now
to
investigate
ones
beliefs
and
it
is
our
position
here
that
beliefs
are
not
a
legitimate
subject
for
inquiry.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
no,
it
really
isn't
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
it
is
a
different
question
because
question
27
asks
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
well
yes
and
so
far
it's
a
communist
party
is
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
as
well
as
asking
whether
in
affect
are
any
of
those
organizations
you
listed
in
response
to
question
25.
is
anyone
of
them
--
does
anyone
of
them
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence?
this
does
bring
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
that
is
correct;
it
has
been
supplemented
by
the
committee,
apparently
coming
forward
as
it
must
on
your
naccp
versus
alabama
to
come
forward
with
a
compelling
state
interest
to
move
in
to
the
area
of
freedom
of
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
think
that
the
reading
of
brief
of
the
respondent
that
the
text
of
their
answer
has
changed
somewhat.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
think
you
should
probably
ask
them
but
i
submit
that
it
should
be
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
no,
i
would
not.
i
think
that
it
should
be
the
committee's
answer
which
was
presented
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
which
ruled
on
the
basis
of
that
memorandum
of
points
and
authorities
thereby
presumably
adopting
the
position
of
the
committee
because
i
had
no
opinion.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
you
mean
that
you
would
just
ignore
the
political
belief
point
and
move
into
some
other
substantive
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
think
that
as
i
understand
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
understand
the
appellate
procedure
it
is
the
general
rule
that
you
must
present
the
issues
to
the
lower
court
as
a
normal
matter
before
they
can
be
presented
here.
however
this
is
certainly
under
the
digression
of
this
court
to
waive,
i'm
sure.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
our
claims
are
first
amendment
as
well
as
fifth
amendment.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
--
i
would
say
that
in
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
yes
because
before
the
arizona
supreme
court,
the
attack
was
clearly
on
political
belief.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
apparently
but
that
statement
is
a
far
cry
from
the
statement
that
the
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
--
committee
stated
before
the
arizona
supreme
court.
it
said
that
it
would
lead
to
an
investigation
as
to
whether
or
not
the
applicant
presently
entertains
the
view
and
if
so
then
they
would
reject
the
application.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
submit
that
it
should
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
issue
as
was
presented
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
for
their
decision.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
i
do.
i
read
the
committee's
statement
as
still
encompassing
belief
because
it
says
actively
believe
i
still
say
that
that
refers
to
her
beliefs
as
i
suppose
to
and
spouses
that
at
the
greatest
extent
would
involve
speech
and
that
does
not
come
close
to
the
brandenburg
decision
this
court
annunciated
just
last
term
where
it
said
that
"you
must
espouse
directed
toward
action
and
is
likely
to
produce
action
of
an
imminent
violent
sort
or
something
to
that
nature",
which
is
really
again
a
far
cry
from
this
statement
by
the
committee.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
that
is
absolutely
correct;
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
assume
so,
yes.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
think
so,
in
konigsberg
and
anastopalo,
they
did
not
answer
the
question
with
respect
to
their
associations
and
it
seemed
to
be
final
and
schneider
versus
smith
where
the
merchant
marine
applicant
was
involved.
he
refused
to
answer
questions
at
that
time,
if
he
had
answered
them
i
suppose
that
could've
disposed
of
the
case.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
no.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
suppose
so.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
that
is
true.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
well
because
i
don't
believe
that
the
committee
can
require
and
answer
to
an
unconstitutional
question
which
is
posed
to
seek
out
political
belief,
to
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
the
question
requires
her
to
make
a
judgment
and
the
burden
presumably
is
upon
her
to
see
whether
they
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
this
requires
her
to
deal
and
grapple
with
the
issues
of
the
smith
act
and
that
kind
of
a
burden
was
specifically
condemned
in
speiser
v.
randall
where
it
said
that
the
burden
in
this
area
should
not
be
applied
on
the
person
who
seeks
a
tax
exemption.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
this
is
--
yes
it
is
because
it
would
make
one
very
much
less
likely
to
join
an
organization
if
he
has
to
always
make
judgments
as
to
whether
that
organization
advocates,
and
if
he
misses
in
his
judgment
as
to
whether
that
organization
advocates,
he
could
be
prosecuted
for
perjury,
i
probably
wouldn't
stand
up
but
he
could
be
prosecuted,
this
is
under
oath.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
if
she
answers
the
question
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
unless
she
answers
the
question
she
will
not
be
admitted
to
the
bar.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
it
does.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
i
think
that
there
probably
would
be.
the
very
last
point
is
our
fifth
amendment
argument
and
this
is
simply
to
the
effect
that
if
an
answer
is
required
and
if
the
answer
were
yes
it
would
be
an
incriminating
circumstance
and
a
link
in
the
chain.
if
spivack
versus
klein
is
to
be
applied
to
the
bar
admission
area
as
oppose
to
the
disbarment
area.
that
seems
to
us
that
logically
petitioner
would
be
able
to
be
a
member
of
the
bar
of
arizona
solely
and
entirely
upon
the
fifth
amendment.
we
respectfully
request
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
be
reversed.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
one
minute
i'll
take.
i
would
like
to
respond
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
about
the
fifth
amendment.
it
was
raised
in
a
letter
to
mr.
wilmer
and
the
committee
and
this
is
part
of
the
record.
it
is
in
june
27,
1968
in
a
form
of
a
letter
were
spevack
versus
klein
was
discussed
and
there
was
a
memorandum
attached
to
that
where
the
application
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
bar
admission
process
was
discussed
and
mr.
wilmer's
brief
that
there
was
a
statement
that
she
did
not
assert
the
right
of
self-incrimination
but
this
is
in
a
letter
dated
july
31,
1969.
mr.
wilmer
sent
to
mr.
davis,
the
clerk
of
this
court
stating
that
that
was
an
incorrect
statement
that
in
fact
she
had
asserted
the
privilege.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
pardon
me.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
against
self
incrimination,
the
fifth
amendment
right.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
by
literal
reading
at
the
smith
act
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
answered
question
25.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
because
we
were
required
mr.
justice
white
under
konigsberg
and
anastaplo
to
answer
that
question
which
called
for
the
names
of
organizations.
she
was
specifically
directed
by
the
mandate
in
those
cases
we
believe
to
answer
that
kind
of
a
question.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
not
at
that
point
at
all,
no.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
because
i
think
konigsberg
and
anastaplo
required
the
pain
of
being
a
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
no,
i
believe
the
first
part
with
respect
to
the
name
of
the
communist
party,
she
does
not
have
that
right
however
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
under
konigsberg
and
anastaplo.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
would
say
we
cannot
stand
on
that
particular
basis
before
this
court
because
of
our
answer
to
question
25.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
we
are
asserting
the
privilege
to
question
27
which
requires
us
to
make
a
determination
of
other
groups
in
that
category
that
she
has
already
listed.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i,
its
both.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
well,
there
may
be
other
groups
mr.
justice
white
such
as
i
can
maybe
the
sts
is
considered
subversive,
maybe
they
are
in
response
to
another
question.
maybe
there
are
other
organizations
which
she
can
draw
the
line
on
and
question
27
is.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
well,
it
in
effect
would
have
that
practical
result,
yes.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
arizona
supreme
court.
it
involves
the
refusal
to
admit
sara
baird
to
the
practice
of
law.
sara
baird,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
graduated
from
stanford
law
school.
she
has
passed
the
bar
examination
and
there’s
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
she
fails
or
lacks
to
have
good
moral
character
and
the
exclusion
of
her
or
the
refusal
to
process
her
application
stands
entirely
from
the
questionnaire
and
affidavit
submitted
to
the
applicants
to
practice
law
in
arizona.
there
are
two
questions
on
that
questionnaire
and
affidavit
which
are
involved
in
this
case.
question
25
requests
the
bar
applicant
to
list
all
organizations,
associations
and
clubs
of
which
you
are
or
had
been
a
member
since
attaining
the
age
of
16
years.
petitioner
complied
with
this
request
and
did
list
the
organizations
as
best
she
could
recall
and
at
the
last
argument
of
this
case,
the
record
was
supplemented
to
show
that
list.
question
27,
however,
is
the
one
petitioner
did
not
answer
and
that
asks
whether
“are
you
now
or
have
you
ever
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
any
organization
that
advocates
to
overthrow
the
united
states
government
by
force
or
violence.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
indeed
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
on
its
face,
it
request
the
applicant
to
make
some
sort
of
judgment
about
the
organizations
which
she
has
listed
in
response
to
question
25
and
it
is
supplemented
in
the
record
by
the
bar
committee
that
the
expressed
purpose
for
this
question
is
to
seek
out
an
orthodox
political
belief
that
the
bar
committee
has
told
us
and
it
is
in
the
record
that
the
basic
hypothesis
for
this
question
is
that
one
who
believes
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
cannot
practice
law
in
arizona.
the
question
is
framed
so
that
if
a
“yes”
answer
is
given
to
question
27,
there
will
be
triggered
and
investigation
and
interrogation
into
the
views
and
beliefs
of
the
applicant
and
the
committee
promises
without
equivocation
that
if
indeed
they
found
from
that
interrogation
and
investigation
that
the
bar
applicant
believed
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government,
that
would
be
sufficient
to
exclude
her
from
the
practice
of
law
or
any
other
applicant.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
belief
alone.
they
are
not
requesting
here
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
that’s
correct.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
belief
alone
is
sufficient
in
order
for
the
committee
to
exclude
a
bar
applicant
and
we
submit
in
our
initial
and
most
important
basis
for
bringing
this
case
here
that
the
court
below
and
the
action
of
the
committee
violates
freedom
of
belief
as
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment.
we
submit
that
the
case
of
speiser
versus
randall
in
which
this
court
wrote
that
in
that
case
where
a
veterans’
tax
exemption
was
dependent
upon
the
execution
of
an
affidavit
proclaiming
non-advocacy
of
overthrow
of
the
government
that
this
court
said
that
kind
of
taxing
situation
was
frankly
aimed
at
the
suppression
of
unpopular
ideas.
our
case
is
even
stronger.
we
have
here
the
right
to
practice
law.
we
have
here
an
expressed
purpose
to
exclude
one
on
the
basis
of
the
views
which
they
may
hold
which
the
committee
seeks
to
obtain
and
speiser
versus
randall
stands
in
almost
unbroken
chain
of
precedent
according
the
essential
right
or
freedom
to
believe
as
one
will
the
utmost
to
protection.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
i
would
say
that
if
you
get
into
the
area
of
political
belief
or
religious
belief
alone
that
the
policeman
would
have
the
right
to
decline
to
answer
that
kind
of
question.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
if
in
fact,
the
record
discloses
that
he
has
(voice
overlap)
of
character
and
right.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
well,
i’m
not--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
would
say
that
he
has
the
same
kind
of
rights
as
the
lawyer
does
not
to
disclose
his
political
beliefs.
i
don’t
know
how
the
right
to
be
a
policeman
maybe
characterized
differently
from
the
right
to
practice
law.
this
court
has
said
that
there
is
a
right
to
practice
law
and
i’m
not
aware
that
this
made
as
similar
pronouncement
as
to
a
right
to
be
a
policeman
but
i
would
say
that
he
would
in
those
circumstances
have
a
right
to
hold
his
political
beliefs
and
violate
and
as
to
whether
or
not
he
has
the
expressed
right
to
become
a
policeman,
i
daresay,
i’m
not
entirely
sure
on
that
point
wholly
apart
from
fifth
amendment
considerations
in
that
sort.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
i
should
think
so.
and
we
take
the
view
which
is
contrary
to
our
opponent
that
the
first
amendment
should
apply
to
teachers
and
to
lawyers
and
to
postman
and
policeman
as
well
as
we
feel
that
it
does
in
this
case
and
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
d.
baird
no
i’m
not
saying
they
are
identical
and
if
i’m
not
correct
in
the
breadths
of
my
statements
with
respect
to
the
application
of
first
amendment,
i
don’t
think
that
the
fact
that
there’s
no
exclusion
of
a
police
officer
should
necessarily
dictate
the
exclusion
of
a
bar
applicant.
the
entire
force
of
the
chain
of
cases
according
to
freedom
of
belief,
this
kind
of
utmost
protection
really
stands
from
an
--
really
a
historical
repugnance
to
the
kind
of
test
those
that
we
have
had
throughout
the
common
law
for
hundred
of
years.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
yes.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
in
ex
parte
garland,
the
supreme
court,
they
are
facing
the
exclusion
of
a
former
confederate
officer
because
he
could
not
take
oath
prescribed
for
him
said
that
to
practice
law
was
a
right
and
it’s
at
page,
i
believe
379,
they
said
that
there
is
a
right
to
practice
law
and
it
can
be
deprived
only
for
misconduct
consisting
of
moral
or
professional
delinquency
and
we
submit
the
same
exact
proposition
that
once
misconduct
should
indeed
be
the
basis
for
excluding
one
or
for
disbarring
one
but
certainly
not
his
political
beliefs.
and
we
draw
as
a
corollary
of
this
argument
that
there
is
no
committee
at
least
in
so
far
as
the
practice
of
law
is
concerned
which
should
be
able
to
say
what
beliefs
lawyers
can
have
and
what
beliefs
lawyers
cannot
have
because
we
feel
that
the
expression
of
this
court
in
west
virginia
versus
barnette,
a
flag
salute
case
that
no
official,
high
or
petty,
or
an
institution
can
prescribed
what’s
orthodox
in
matters
of
politics
and
conscience
and
religion.
but
even
more
than
freedom
of
belief
is
involve
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
there
is
also
another
first
amendment
argument
which
would
rest
on
freedom
of
association.
we
have
answered
question
25.
we
have
given
the
list
of
the
names
and
the
organizations
but
the
committee
is
not
content
with
that
and
wishes
to
take
the
process
a
step
further.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
she
has
absolutely.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
question
27,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
no.
well,
on
its
face
it’s
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
a
cause
for
some
kind
of
judgment
on
her
part
under
the
smith
act
perhaps
as
to--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
and
then
there
was
an
exclusion
because
if
the
answer
had
been
“yes”
and
if
then
they
tried
to
interrogate
her
about
her
beliefs,
perhaps
it
would
but
i
think
we
would
have
been
surrendering
a
great
deal
not
only
our
fifth
but
fourteenth
and
perhaps
even
fifth
amendment
rights.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
but
in
konigsberg
and
anastaplo,
the
person
was
not
--
did
not
answer
the
question
and
this
court
felt
that
it
was
ripe
enough
for
a
decision
to
be
rendered
on
whether
or
not
there
was
a
final
case
and
whether
or
not
the
issue
had
presented
but
even
apart
from
that,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
this
court
has
continuously
in
this
area
of
freedom
of
belief
and
association
require
the
state
to
come
forward
with
a
compelling
and
controlling
state
interest
for
an
encroachment
into
the
freedom
of
association
or
belief
area.
and
we
submit
that
the
purpose
advanced
by
the
committee
which
in
this
case
is
to
seek
out
the
beliefs
of
the
applicant
is
neither
controlling
nor
is
a
compelling
and
we
submit
that
it
is
not
even
constitutional.
and
we
believe
that
the
area
of
for
example
the
congressional
investigation
area,
this
court
has
held
that
you
have
a
right
and
a
duty
to
comply
with
the
investigatorial
apparatus
for
the
government
to
seek
out
facts
but
you
have
a
right
to
draw
a
line
on
questions
which
seek
to
abridge
first
amendment
freedom
such
as
belief.
we
submit
that
in
this
case,
solely
in
the
first
amendment,
there
is
a
right
to
draw
a
line
on
a
question
which
is
aimed
for
this
purpose
and
this
purpose
alone
and
in
terms
of
the
freedom
of
association,
if
in
fact
it
is
a
deterrent
for
a
person
to
list
the
names
of
his
organizations
such
as
the
teacher
in
shelton
versus
tucker.
it
should
be
even
more
deterring
to
an
individual
not
simply
to
be
able
to
list
them
but
to
have
to
characterized
them
under
the
smith
act
to
be
threatened
within
interrogation
and
investigation
and
to
beliefs
if
the
answer
is
“yes”
and
then
to
be
threatened
with
the
exclusions
solely
upon
the
beliefs
of
the
applicant.
we
submit
that
this
is
in
fact
the
deterrence
and
would
fall
within
the
line
of
cases
under
shelton
versus
tucker
and
in
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
that
is
ex
parte
garland.
it’s
an
old
case.
its
1867,
we
cited
on
page
17
of
our
brief
and
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
that
is
correct.
the
two
cases
which
are
very
much
in
this
area
are
of
course
the
konigsberg
and
anastaplo
decisions.
we
submit
that
the
line
was
drawn
in
both
of
those
cases
with
respect
to
freedom
of
belief
because
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
no,
i
do
not
think
so
because
it
would
have
been
a
sanction
of
the
purpose
of
the
committee
which
is
to
seek
out
the
political
belief
of
the
applicants
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
think
in
the
brief
filed
before
this
court,
the
committee
has
said
an
“i
don’t
know
answer”
would
be
acceptable
to
them.
but
if
in
fact
the
committee’s
need
for
data
is
so
strong
and
“i
don’t
know
answer”
may
not
--
just
i
do
not
understand
how
it
could
be
sufficient
under
the
circumstances.
however,
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
she
did
not
answer
question
27.
she
listed
the
words
“not
applicable.”
mr.
peter
d.
baird
that’s
correct.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
well,
that
seems
to
me
was
part
of
the
record
before
the
arizona
supreme
court
and
that
constitutionally
this
question
could
not
be
answered
up
for
and
an
answer
to
it
is
not
required
under
the
first,
fourteenth
and
fifth
amendments
as
were
submitted
below.
we
contend
that
under
konigsberg
and
anastaplo,
justice
harlan
was
careful
at
least
it
appears
to
us
that
he
was
careful
in
pointing
out
that
speiser
versus
randall
did
not
apply
to
those
cases
because
there
was
no
intent
to
penalized
political
belief
in
the
konigsberg
case.
and
we
submit
that,
that
sharply
distinguishes
that
case
from
ours
because
there
is
here
and
the
record
is
replete
with
evidence
where
there
is
an
attack
on
political
belief.
finally,
we
find
that
the
decision
below
thus
violate
due
process
because
we
submit
that
it
is
arbitrary
in
using
a
question
such
of
this
nature
for
finding
out
the
political
beliefs
of
the
applicants
particularly
where
the
committee
does
not
request
the
purpose
for
this
as
seeking
a
conduct.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
d.
baird
well,
it
could
--
if
in
fact
they
have
a
right
to
ask
the
question
then
i
would
say
and
if
i’m
wrong
and
all
of
the
points
that
i’m
presenting
here
in
my
brief,
i
guess
in
fact
you
could
say
that
it’s
not
arbitrary
because
i
would
lose
on
the
points
of
law
that
i’m
submitting
to
you.
it
is
my
position
that
it
is
arbitrary
to
seek
out
political
belief
because
it
really
does
not
have
that
close,
a
nexus
or
a
relationship
with
ones
performance
as
a
lawyer.
for
example,
take
the
ardent,
hard-core
racist
who
is
in
his
mind
though
he
is
never
translated
it
into
conduct.
he
disbelieves
in
equal
protection
clause,
he
disbelieves
in
brown
versus
board
of
education,
he
disbelieves
with
as
many
as
venal
facts
as
he
possibly
can.
i
submit
that
that
man
has
a
right
to
practice
law.
he
has
a
right
to
practice
law
just
as
much
as
the
person
who
has
an
apparent
left-wing
belief
because
it
is
the
point
made
in
ex
parte
garland
that
you
judge
a
man
by
his
conduct.
if
in
fact
he
translates
these
venal
facts
into
conduct
that
is
repugnant
to
the
united
states
constitution
and
the
equal
protection
clause
then
he
should
be
excluded
at
the
gate
or
he
should
be
disbarred.
but
the
mere
holding
of
a
belief
will
by
anybody
standards
depend
on
their
own
subjective
point
of
view.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
if
in
fact
as
i
say
mr.
justice
black,
if
i
lose
then
it
won’t
be
arbitrary
and
they
will
be
able
to
ask
the
question.
it
is
our
further
point
that
this
has
an
intimidation
effect.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
if
in
fact
there
is
an
intimidating
effect
that
we
would
submit
that
if
in
fact
the
committee
on
examination
send
admissions
can
seek
out
the
beliefs
of
the
bar
applicants
and
if
in
fact
that
can
be
the
basis
for
their
exclusion
then
it
seems
to
us
that
there
may
well
be
an
intimidating
effect
upon
lawyers
to
speak
their
minds,
upon
lawyers
to
join
organizations
they
wish
and
perhaps
even
to
represent
unpopular
and
repudiated
points
of
view.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
that
would
be
first.
so,
we
also
feel
that
it
has
certain
arbitrariness
because
it
produces
a
result
which
would
be
counterproductive
to
at
least
a
maintenance
of
a
free
bar
which
would
be
free
to
speak
and
to
represent
as
they
will.
not
free
however
to
engage
in
bombing
or
misconduct
but
free
to
think
and
to
act
and
to
join
and
so
far
as
the
law
permits.
finally,
we
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes.
you
reach
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
you
reach
the
belief
problem.
we
say
that
it
is
arguable
on
the
face
on
the
question
that
a
cause
for
some
kind
of
belief
about
the
organization.
it’s
an
arguable
point.
but
we
reach
the
belief
problem
because
on
the
first
amendment
area,
this
court
has
said
to
the
states,
you
are
in
the
first
amendment
area,
come
forth
with
a
kind
of
compelling
and
controlling
state
interest
that
you
must
have
to
proceed
in
this
first
amendment
area.
and
in
this
case,
the
committee
has
come
forward
and
said,
our
compelling
and
controlling
state
interest
is
to
seek
out
the
beliefs
of
those
who
will
answer
that
question,
“yes”.
those
who
we
deem
to
be
dangerous
because
of
their
beliefs
and
once
the
question
has
a
purpose
of
that
nature,
we
feel
that
under
the
first
amendment,
that
question
need
not
be
ask
in
naacp
versus
button,
the
questions
ask
there
to
bring
forth
a
membership
list.
the
court
requested
that
the
purpose
for
that
question
be
made
clear
and
upon
examining
that
purpose,
this
court
found
it
was
not
sufficient
in
order
to
permit
an
encroachment
and
enter
the
freedom
of
association
area.
so
we
say
on
the
face
on
the
question
as
well
as
the
clear
record
supplemented
by
the
committee
on
examinations
admissions,
we
do
reach
the
belief
issue
and
reach
it
on
a
very
significant
way
because
they
promise
to
exclude
on
the
basis
of
belief.
finally,
we
make
the
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
exclude.
they
are
going
to
inquire
further
and
then
they
are
going
to
exclude
if
in
fact
that
belief
is
unacceptable
to
them
and
we
say
that
they
do
not
have
the
power
to
design
and
ask
a
question
of
bar
applicants
if
the
only
purpose
they
have
is
to
get
at
the
beliefs
of
the
individual
applicants
because
that
is
not
a
part
of
their
jurisdictional
domain.
it
is
not
permissible
under
the
first
amendment
and
there
is
a
further
issue
in
this
case
and
it
does
involve
the
fifth
amendment.
question
27
calls
for
an
incriminating
answer.
if
the
answer
given
were
yes,
it
would
take
the
applicant
directly
into
the
heartland
of
a
smith
act.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment
in
this
case
does
not
necessarily
depend
upon
the
answer
given
rather
it
hinges
upon
the
question
and
the
nature
of
the
question
as
a
matter
of
law.
if
in
fact
one
need
not
show
an
actual
hazard
before
invoking
the
fifth
amendment
in
an
area
pervaded
with
criminal
statutes
such
as
this
and
if
in
fact
the
innocent
as
well
as
the
guilty
may
claim
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
as
has
been
said
by
this
court.
and
if
in
fact
the
good
faith
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
as
this
court
said
in
united
states
versus
covington
usually
one
of
law,
then
we
submit
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
one
may
read
question
27
and
one
may
validly
invoke
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
on
the
basis
of
the
question
alone.
we
contend
that
logically
under
the
force
of
spevack
versus
klein,
one
cannot
exclude
a
bar
applicant
by
refusing
to
comply
with
something
that
has
an
incriminating
effect.
there
is
no
logical
distinction
between
a
disbarment
proceeding
and
an
exclusion
from
the
bar
and
i
think
that
point
was
made
invalidly
so
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
his
dissent
in
that
case.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
under
this
argument
that
is
correct.
we
however,
would
answer
a
question
that
related
to
conduct
however
that
is
not
to
concede
--
but
that
is
not
to
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
that’s
true.
however,
we
would
not
concede
that
spevack
versus
klein
does
not
apply
to
bar
admissions
and
there
is
really
--
spevack
does
have
a
logical
import
to
it
that
would
carry
you
from
the
disbarment
situation
to
the
exclusion
situation
at
the
door.
so,
we
would
con
--
in
conclusion,
we
submit
the
sara
baird
that
should
be
made
a
lawyer
and
that
the
area
of
freedom
of
belief
remain
inviolate.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
25.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
submit
mr.
chief
justice,
that
by
answering
question
25
in
trying
to
comply
with
the
committee
with
the
question
on
its
face
which
has
no
either
incriminating
purpose
or
has
no
purpose
to
seek
out
some
unorthodox
point
of
view
or
something
of
that
nature
that
petitioner
did
consent
to
answer
that
question
to
help
the
committee
if
in
fact
it
wanted
help.
but
question
27
is
not
just
a
blend
or
general
list
of
all
your
organizations,
it
has
written
right
across
it
that
there
is
right
answer
and
a
wrong
answer
and
that
you’re
supposed
to
make
a
judgment
about
these
organizations
you
list
in
question
25
that
you
pointed
out.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
question
25
requested
that
the
petitioner
list
all
organizations
to
which
she
has
belong
since
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
since
age
16
and
then
she
refused
to
answer
the
further
question,
question
27
which
went
into
whether
it’s
a
communist
party
or
any
subversive
organization
and
she
says
that
by
answering
question
25
and
listing
the
name
of
an
organization,
she
does
not
waive
her
right
to
draw
the
line
on
a
question
that
requires
her
to
characterize
whether
this
happen
to
be
a
subversive
organization
and
she
doesn’t
waive
her
right
to
resist
the
question
which
now
we
have
been
told
without
any
equivocation
is
aimed
at
seeking
out
theoretical
or
an
unorthodox
political
belief
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
yes,
question
27
said,
“are
you
now
or
have
you
ever
been
a
member
of
a
communist
party
or
any
organization
that
advocates
overthrow
of
the
united
states
government?”
mr.
peter
d.
baird
no,
no
that
was
it.
mr.
peter
d.
baird
no,
that
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
i
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
it
does
to
this
extent,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
the
committee
had
come
out
and
told
us
that
the
purpose
for
question
25
is
the
same
purpose
as
it
is
in
question
27,
and
that
is
to
find
out
those
who
are
a
member
of
the
republican
party
and
they
would
screen
out
those
who
hold
republican
beliefs.
i
would
say
she
would
have
the
same
right
to
not
answer
that
question
as
she
has
to
refuse
to
answer
question
27.
question
27
is
significantly
different,
it
asked
her
to
make
a
judgment
under
the
smith
act
or
under
whatever
kind
of
substantive
principle
she
must
to
see
whether
these
are
organizations
which
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
united
states
government
by
force
and
violence.
and
on
its
face,
it
has
the
suggestion
that
they
are
after
political
belief
and
that
doubt
was
a
resolve
when
the
committee
has
now
told
us
indeed.
it
is
to
find
out
what
her
beliefs
are
but
i
don’t
think
that
you
can
say
that
there
is
a
waiver
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
she
listed
in
question
25
--
mr.
peter
d.
baird
no,
she
has
already
listed
that
she
belonged
to
the
young
democrats
and
the
young
republicans
but
what
they
want
to
know
is
whether
she
believes
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
and
we
submit
--
by
force
and
violence,
that’s
correct
and
we
submit
that
they
could
ask
whether
do
you
believe
in
the
equal
protection
clause
and
whether
you
believe
in
complying
with
the
orders
of
this
court.
the
beliefs
of
a
right
wing,
of
a
left
wing,
of
a
middle
of
the
road
are
really
inviolate
we
submit.
and
when
the
purpose
is
such,
as
it
is
here
to
seek
out
beliefs
to
use
that
as
a
trigger
to
an
inquiry
and
to
beliefs,
then
that
question
is
on
its
face
and
it
has
been
supplemented
on
the
record
by
the
committee
not
worth
answering.
so
we
again
submit
that
sara
baird
should
practice
law.
