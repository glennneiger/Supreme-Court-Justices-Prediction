black
you
mean
they

black
and
they
asked

black
we
have
to

as
though

justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
doesn't

black
but
it's
not
a

it?
justice

l.
black
this
one,
one
asked
all
associations
and
just
picked
one
out
in
particular.
justice

l.
black
would
she
have
been
required
on
the
answer
in
answering
question
25
to
state
that
she
had
been
a

well,
it
was
required
you
said.
justice

black
we
could
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
she
has
been
asked
if
she
belong
to
the
communist
party
and
has
said
no.
justice

black
now
i
would
ask
you
a
question
at
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in

of
your
answer
that
further
have
when
she
was
asked
to
state
all
of
the

that
she
belong
to
since
she
had
been
16
years

was
that
asking
her
to
state
if
she
had
been
a
communist
just
the

as
27
more
on?
justice

that
is
a

she
stated
the

she
said
she's
belong
to.
