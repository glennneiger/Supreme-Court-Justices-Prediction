justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
if
you
go
on
and
say
not
only
may
they
not
pry
into
the
mind
but
that
the
petitioner
may
--
is
constitutionally
entitled
not
only
to
believe
without
being
barred
from
admission
of
the
bar,
but
also
to
join
an
organization
with
others
who
have
similar
beliefs.
in
the
first
place
and
secondly
to
join
an
organization
of
others
who
have
not
only
similar
beliefs
but
who
actively
the
organization
as
an
entity,
actively
pursues
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
the
petitioners
constitutionally
entitled
to
join
that
organization,
still
be
a
member
of
the
bar
until
the
message
is
proved
that
by
conduct
he
joins
the
activity
of
the
organization.
he
joins
in
the
activity
of
the
organization.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
let's
assume
that
there
is
some
point
in
which
his
affiliation
with
the
organization
would
disqualify.
may
the
state
as
a
preliminary
matter
ask
him
if
he's
a
member
of
the
organization?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
the
state
may
say
to
a
person
"are
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party"?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
disqualify
him
if
he
refuses
to
answer?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
specific
question
whether
they
can
disqualify
her
if
she
is
a
member,
i
understand
that.
and
you
think
it's
a
different
question
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
if
she
answers
yes
it's
a
different
question
as
to
what
she
can
be
disqualified
from
practice.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
i
understand
that
do
you
find
belief
that
that
is
an
inquiry
of
belief
i
gather
only
from
the
response
of
the
committee
itself.
you
don't
find
that
facing
that
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
the
state
now
argues
in
this
court
as
to
what
the
reason
for
the
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
whom
should
we
believe,
the
bar
committee
or
their
bar
committee's
views
as
expressed
in
the
court
below
or
the
bar
committee's
views
as
it's
expressed
here
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
would
accept
whatever
answer
they
give?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
if
the
judgment
is
sustainable
on
another
ground?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
the
state
now
asserts,
what
sustained
the
matter
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
offer
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
is
the
--
they're
all
first
amendment
claims
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
well
if
the
first
amendment
claim
was
presented
in
the
lower
court
and
if
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
on
the
first
amendment
claim
is
sustainable
on
another
first
amendment
ground,
is
that
improper
appellate
practice?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
what
the
question
asked.
that
is
what
the
questioned
ask,
your
just
relying
on
the
statement
as
to
what
they
would
do
if
she
answered
the
question
or
the
reason
for
the
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
feel
that
the
fifth
amendment
claim
is
open
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
indication
that
at
any
time
during
these
proceedings
at
least
until
it
got
to
the
supreme
court
that
there
was
refusal
to
answer
at
question
27
on
the
grounds
of
self-incrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
there
any
correspondents
or
any
conferences
where
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
fifth
amendment
was
raised
--
justice
byron
r.
white
without
refusing
the
answer
to
the
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
was
it
--
it
was
urged
in
the
supreme
court
of
arizona?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
a
memorandum
supporting
the
petition?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
that
mention
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
she
answered
the
question
25?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
did
she
refuse
to
answer
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
question
25
is
to
state
whether
you
are
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
also
state
all
other
organizations
of
which
you
are
a
member.
would
you
have
had
the
right
to
assert
the
privilege
in
any
respect?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
take
you're
entitled
to
assert
the
privilege
of
self
incrimination
as
the
first
part
of
question
27?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
the
state
may
and
in
spite
of
the
privilege
as
mrs.
baird,
are
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
but
i
want
to
know
what
you're
asserting
here.
are
you
asserting
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
to
shield
mrs.
baird
from
having
to
answer
the
question,
“are
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party?”
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the,
what
--
it
would
respect
to
what,
are
you
asserting
the
privilege
in
this
litigation?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
a
fifth
amendment
claim
or
a
first
amendment
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
is
it
a
fifth
amendment
claim?
it
is
a,
you
you've
said
i
am.
let's
assume
you
had
answered
i
am
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
do
you
think
then
that
--
do
you
think
then
that
even
though
you
had
answered
that
question
you
could
also
assert
the
privilege
and
say
i
am
privileged
not
to
characterize
the
communist
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
have
a
question
27
only
refers
to
the
organizations
that
you
listed
in
25?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
looked
at
those
questions
that
those
organizations
you
listed
in
25
and
you
ask
yourself
are
there
any
of
these
groups
subversive,
i
have
listed
them
or
any
of
this
group
subversive,
you
think
that
is
a,
you
have
a
fifth
amendment
right
then
refuse
to
answer
that
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
your
submission
that
this
court
has
held
that
there
is
a
right
to
practice
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
what
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
i
glance
over
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
appear
to
have
to
do
with
permission
to
take
the
state
bar
exam.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
petitioner
has
taken
the
state
bar
exam.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
suppose
the
answer
were
“i
don’t
know”
or
“not
to
my
knowledge?”
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
if
you
go
on
and
say
not
only
may
they
not
pry
into
the

but
that
the
petitioner
may

justice
byron

white
well
let's
assume
that
there
is
some
point
in

his
affiliation
with
the

would
disqualify.
may
the
state
as
a

justice
byron

you

and
then
disqualify
him

a

whether
they
can
disqualify
her

i
understand
that.
and
you

it's
a

no,
if

yes
it's
