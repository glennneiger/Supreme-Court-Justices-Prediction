justice
john
m.
harlan
well
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
mrs.
baird
will
not
be
admitted
to
the
bar
if
the
record
shows
that
you
will
not
be
admitted
to
the
bar
unless
she
answers
the
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
unless
she
answers
the
questions.
justice
john
m.
harlan
didn't
the
record
show
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
i
would
suppose
there's
plenty
of
finality
on
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
reading
from
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
why
isn't
this
on
the
appendix?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
the
paper
actually
physically
in
the
clerk's
office?
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
thank
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
i'm
reading
that
again
then
since
we
have
all
have
the
cause.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
mr.
wilmer?
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
this
litigation
never
been
brought
and
mrs.
baird
simply
persisted
in
her
view
that
she
didn't
have
to
answer
the
question.
what
would
have
happen
to
her
application
to
the
bar,
her
admission
to
the
bar?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
origin,
is
it
fair
to
say
that
in
practical
effect
as
far
as
her
position
is
concern,
you're
continuing
to
sit
down
on
the
hypothetical
premises
that
no
litigation
had
been
brought
here
will
be
the
equivalent
if
you're
saying,
“well
you're
required
to
answer
this
question,
since
you
won't
cooperate
with
the
committee,
we
won't
admit
you
in
to
the
bar.
is
that
accurate?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
think
you
get
much
of
this
for
saying
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
those
first
statutes
that
you're
talking
about
are
not
incorporated
in
the
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
to
take
a
position
that
this
is
preliminary?
justice
john
m.
harlan
preliminary
that
needs
further
investigation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
another
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
long
has
this
questioned
in
the
present
form
been
part
of
the
process
and
requirement
for
admission?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
has
not
been
revised.
justice
john
m.
harlan
has
there
been
any
attempts
to
revise
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
actually
ask
the
number
of
questions
perhaps
they're
a
little
outside
the
record
that
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
ask
them
in
understanding
that
in
any
other
way.
in
light
of
what
you
say
your
standards
would
be
in
mrs.
baird
in
answering
this
question
going
further
in
satisfying
yourself
that
this
was
something
more
than
that
belief
in
the
abstract's
answer.
have
you
ever
asked
your
court
to
change
the
form
of
that
question
to
incorporate
those
elements
in
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
second
question
that
i
wanted
to
ask
you
is
if
this
litigation
pending
what's
the
fate
of
that
question
as
it's
in
present
form
now
or
applicants
refusing
to
answer
or
you're
holding
up
or
are
they
answering
it
or
oops,
they
are
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
course
your
question
is
a
little
broader,
it's
not
on
communist
party
but
other
subversive
organizations.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
therefore
i
would
suppose
that
a
failure
to
answer
the
party
wouldn't
necessary
say
address
if
this
question
is
proper
on
27,
so
that
you
don't
have
to
bear
it
true
and
find
out
which
of
the
organizations
maybe
subversive
and
so
forth.
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
mrs.
baird
in
answer
to
this
question,
since
she
had
been
a
member
of
communist
party.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
what

committee
would
have
done?
