justice
potter
stewart
mr.
baird,
i
saw
that
in
the
brief
and
then
i
looked
in
the
appendix
and
i
found
that
the
form
in
the
questionnaire
was
there
but
i
didn’t
see
the
answers
that
she
gave
to
that
question
or
did
any
other
question.
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
do
we
not
then
know
so
far
as
the
record
goes
that
she
did
fully
answer
question
25?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
think
it
just
appears
to
me
and
maybe
i'm
quite
wrong
and
in
the
course
of
your
argument,
maybe
you’ll
persuade
me
so,
but
that
the
validity
of
the
refusal
to
answer
question
27
might
depend
upon
what
answer
was
given
to
question
25
and
we
don’t
know
what
answer
was
given
to
question
25.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
don’t
want
to
throw
you
off
here.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
understand
it
mr.
baird
that
it's
your
submission
that
it's
no
business
at
all
of
the
government,
either
in
hiring
employees
or
in
qualifying
applicants
for
to
follow
various
professions
that
it's
absolutely
no
business
of
government
to
ask
any
questions
of
any
kind
to
such
applicants
as
to
those
applicants
beliefs.
justice
potter
stewart
well
now
its
--
your
narrowing
it
a
bit
now.
justice
potter
stewart
well
apart
from
merely
technical
professional
in
competency,
let's
take
the
police
officer
and
let's
say
he's
of
the
requisite
weight
and
height
and
these
educational
qualifications.
but
then
they
--
he
comes
to
their
attention,
he
believes
in
that
all
negroes
are
inferior,
that
their
all
criminals
and
that
there
should
be
absolute
segregation
in
the
races
--
between
the
races
in
the
city
in
which
he's
applying
at
as
a
police
officer,
either
a
chance
relevant
at
all,
to
his
ability
to
act
as
a
police
officer
representing
the
public?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
has
to
do
with
his
belief
as
to
what
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
14th
amendment
means.
well
let's
assume
that
he
is
very
strongly
of
the
belief
that
the
way
to
solve
human
problems,
controversies
between
human
beings
or
between
that
individual
in
the
state
is
not
by
law
but
is
by
throwing
bombs.
now
do
you
think
he
ought
to
be
admitted
to
be
a
lawyer
in
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
if
all
his
beliefs
are
that
the
law
is
absolutely
a
useless
mechanism
to
solve
any
problems
and
that
the
way
to
do
it
is
by
assassination
and
bombs
and
machine
guns.
justice
potter
stewart
but
were
not
here
talking
about
whether
or
not
such
a
belief
might
be
protected
in
the
abstract
which
i
suppose
that
everybody
would
agree
to.
but
the
question
is
about
whether
such
a
person
is
the
kind
of
a
person
who
would
have
the
proper
ingredients
to
be
a
lawyer.
on
account
of
state
which
does
setup
standards
for
to
admission
to
his
bar.
relevantly,
make
such
an
inquiry.
justice
potter
stewart
but
mr.
brandenburg
wasn't
an
applicant
to
the
bar
of
arizona.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
posture
of
this
case
procedurally?
i'm
thinking
i've
had
in
mind
concerned
about
the
finality,
in
other
words
if
this
question
27
where
it
answered
no.
i
suppose
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
since
it
hasn't
yet
been
answered
at
all
is
it
a
final
judgment
over
which
we
can
take
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
for
sometimes
i
don't
have
in
mind
the
precise
posture
of
those
cases
but
sometimes
it
could
resolve
in
contempt
and
what
not.
but
that
hasn't
happened
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
here,
it's
just
pending.
it
is
just
pending,
if
the
answer
is
no
to
that
question
then
that's
the
end
of
it
i
suppose,
she's
admitted
to
the
bar
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
the
answer
is
yes
then
there
maybe
more
proceedings
and
they
might
not
be
admitted
to
the
bar?
justice
potter
stewart
now
why
is
it
anything
final
over
which
we
have
jurisdiction
at
this
juncture?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it
even
on
the
full
record
that
is
here,
we
do
not
have
mrs.
braid's
answers
to
question
25,
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
would
there
be
any
objection
either
of
you
who
is
supplementing
this
record
if
this
is
an
admitted
fact
that
she
answered
them
and
do
submit
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
submit
the
answers.
justice
potter
stewart
i
myself
i'd
like
to
see
the
record
supplemented.
justice
potter
stewart
how
did
she
answer?
how
did
she
answer
question
27?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
right.
well,
that
was
--
she
didn’t
just
leave
it
blank,
did
she?
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
suppose
she
meant
by
“not
applicable?”
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
under
this
argument
you
couldn’t
ask
the
applicant
whether
he
had
ever
committed
grand
larceny
or
murder
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
(voice
overlap)
argument
doesn’t
accept
conduct
in
fact
is
a
fortiori.
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
in
this
case
which
you
said,
it’s
where
it
been
work
out
informally
at
least
by
the
supreme
court
and
by
your
committee
that
they
do
take
the
exams
without
being
cleared
in
fact
and
that
they
sign
some
sort
of
a
letter,
did
you
say?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
understand
that.
but
i
thought
you
said
that
the
applicant
signs
some
sort
of
a
statement
stressing
his
agreement
on
that
condition.
