justice
john
m.
harlan
what
would
you
say
if
it
was
turned
around
the
other
way?
the
judge
might
think
he
ought
to
be
convicted,
but
the
jury
would
say
it
was
the
other
story.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
haven’t
juvenile
courts
had
told
him
and
not
turn
all
over
the
other
courts?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
it
the
--
as
a
result
of
him
acquiring
a
certain
age?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
purely
administrative
and
as
i
pointed
out
yesterday.
this
matter
whether
or
not
this
statute
which
allows
this
transfer
is
unconstitutional
should
be
attack
in
that
way
rather
than
attacking
the
juvenile
court
system
through
this
vehicle.
but
the
fact
that
he
is
in
the
penal
complex
is
by
virtue
of
a
separate
statute
which
is
not
at
issue
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
he
is
now
in
the
penal
institution
where
man
or
woman
who
is
an
adult
would
be
if
convicted
of
forgery?
