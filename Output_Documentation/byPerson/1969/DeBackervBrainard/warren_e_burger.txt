in

you
almost
seem
to
be
asking
for
what
mr.

just
suggested,
you
say
since
his
case
is
a
criminal
case
in
any
realistic
sense
of

now,
if
you
add
all
these
incidents
of
the
other
world,
that
is,
of
the
adult
world
aren’t
you
going
to
wind
up
having
all
juveniles
tried
in--
i’m
not
talking
about
you
personally,
of
course,
mr.

if
this

continues,
aren’t
we
indeed
well
on
the
way
toward
abolishing
the
whole

concept
and

chief

e.

i
suppose
we
can
take
judicial
notice,
although
it
is
also
in

here

of
the

in

you’re

they

chief

what
happens

it

chief

it’s

isn’t
it?
chief

chief

about

chief

if
you

chief

e.

isn’t
that
one
of
the
considerations
that
led
the

chief

e.

as
you
terminated
yesterday,
i
think
you
would
just
making
the
point
that
nowhere
in
this
case
is
there
any
attack
on
the
validity
of
this
administrative
process
by
which
he
was
transferred
out
of
a
juvenile
detention
establishment
into
an
adult
penal
institution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
think
your
point
was
as
you
have
just
made
it
again,
that
if
anything
is
the
correct
attack
by
collateral
proceedings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
while
we
have
you
have
there,
although
it
probably
is
not
relevant
here,
was
there
any
kind
of
hearing
in
the
administrative
process
of
making
this
transfer
from
one
institution
to
the
other?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there
are
hearing
of
some
kind
--
chief

warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
he
be
sent
in
the
first
instance
by
the
juvenile
court
to
the
penal
institution
or
must
be
first
be
sent
to
the
juvenile
institution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
the
nebraska
statute
in
effect
vests
broader
power
in
the
administrative
managers
of
the
juvenile
institution
than
they
do
in
the
juvenile
judge
himself,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
any
standards
at
all
prescribed
by
statute
for
the
transfer,
guidelines?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
speaking
now
of
one
jury
trial?
chief

warren
e.

and
while
they're
doing

they
doing

mr.

mr.

chief

warren
e.

mr.

we
might
go
we're
on
that
point.
suppose
that
there
were
jury
trial
committed
under
the
nebraska
statute
and
there
were
confronted
with
the
situation
of
having
the
mother
be
entrusted
with
waiving

not
waiving
the
jury

would
you
think
that
the
situation
would
be
a
desirable
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
think
as
suggested
by
either
mr.

or
mr.

that
this
might
be
a
very,
very
large
proportion
of
all
the
juvenile
cases
coming
before
the

parents
who
are
not
responsible
people,
parents
who
do
not
have
a
relationship
with
trust
and
confidence
with
the
child
for
whom
they
would
be
called
upon
to
waive
of
the
jury?
chief

warren
e.

as
a

as

or
would
he
have
to

a

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
care
to
comment
on
mr.
justice
stewart's
line
of
questioning
i
think
to
mr.
scanlan
awhile
ago
about
whether
there
is
a
problem
of
a
16
or
a
17-year-old
getting
a
jury
of
his
peers
if
the
jury
is
25
or
older?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
line,
i
think
this
problem
of
jury
of
peers
is
still
presents
a
problem
even
though
you
as
counsel
in
a
particular
juvenile
case
would
not
regard
it
as
a
problem.
what
do
you
think
the
constitution
means
by
a
jury
of
peers?
this
is
a
term
which
has
come
back
into
currency
in
recent
years
are
very
peer
conscious
in
our
society
at
the
moment.
what
do
you
think
it
means
in
this
context?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
constitution
doesn't
say
an
adult
jury
it
says
a
jury
of
peers,
if
i
remember
the
language.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
know
what
it's
meant
in
the
society
in
which
--
from
which
it
was

it
meant
that
a
nobleman
was
entitled
to
be
tried
by
nobleman
and
the
gentleman
by
a
gentleman
and
a
peasant
by
a
peasants
and
so
forth,
i'm
not
sure
that's
the
precise
classification,
but
enters
the
general
idea.
now,
what
you
think
about
of
teenagers
who
would
well
press
a
moment
to
being
peer
conscious
might
--
one
of
them
might
demand
you
as
his
counsel
that
he
wanted
a
jury
of
his
peers,
that
is
to
say,
a
jury
composed
of
people
less
than
18
years
of
age?
chief

warren
e.

you
can
see
it

there.
