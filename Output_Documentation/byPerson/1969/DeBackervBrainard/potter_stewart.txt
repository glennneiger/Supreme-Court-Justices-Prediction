justice
potter
stewart
why
can’t
you
rely
on
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
state
does,
in
fact,
give
a
jury
trial,
the
adult--
justice
potter
stewart
that
it
must
to
juveniles,
as
situated
as
this
one
was.
justice
potter
stewart
first
of
all,
i
suppose
a
jury
trial
would
necessarily
involve
a
public
trial,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
which,
of
course,
would
run
contrary
to
the
idea,
as
the
chief
justice
has
said,
which
was
in
the
minds
of
those
who
conceived
the
juvenile
court
system.
one
of
their
ideas
was
that
the
proceedings
be
private.
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
but,
beyond
that,
you
keep
talking
about
guilty
of
this
offense,
guilt
or
innocence,
but
the
charge
was
that
this
young
man,
this
juvenile,
was
a
delinquent
child
and
i
suppose
evidence
of
whether
or
not
he
was
a
delinquent
child
would
go
far
beyond
the
evidence
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
committed
a
specific
offense.
it
would
also
involve
all
sorts
of
things
about
his
previous
record
and
about
his
conduct
generally,
and
his
environment
and
reputation,
and
all
those
things
that
generally
are
entirely
inadmissible
in
a
criminal
trial
when
the
only
question
is
whether
or
not
the
defendant
committed
a
particularly--
a
particular
offense
defined
in
the
indictment.
is
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
under
the
law,
nebraska
is
the
only
basis
on
which
a
person
can
found--
be
found
to
be
a
delinquent?
justice
potter
stewart
necessarily
so,
is
that
true
in
nebraska?
justice
potter
stewart
now
can,
under
nebraska
law,
can
a
child
in
need
of
supervision,
as
the
statute
define
it,
can
such
child
be
put
into
custody
in
an
industrial
school
or
a
specialist?
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
submission,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
any
proceeding
that
can
and
does
result
in
involuntary
custody
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
that,
with
respect
to
any
such
proceeding,
the
constitution
provides
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
so
if
you’re
correct
in
your
answer,
your
tentative
answer,
as
to
the
nebraska
law
with
respect
to
a
child
in
need
of
special
supervision,
a
jury
trial
would
follow
would
also
be
required
for
such
proceedings.
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well--
but
you
answered
tentatively
and
i’m
not
holding
you
to
this
at
all
but,
that
your
impression
is
that
if,
in
nebraska,
a
child
is
determined
to
be
one
who
is
in
need
of
special
supervision,
he
can
be
sent
to
an
industrial
school
and,
thereby--
and,
there,
confined
against
his
will
for
a
substantial
period
of
time.
now,
let’s
assume
that’s
true.
justice
potter
stewart
then
i
suppose
it
would
follow
from
your
argument
that
the
constitution
requires
a
jury
trial
before
he
can
be
found
to
be
a
child
in
need
of
special
supervision.
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
separate
lawsuit
or
a
separate
proceeding
has
been
initiated
attacking
that
transfer,
did
you
say?
justice
potter
stewart
no?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
the
way
to
do
it
is
a
separate
proceeding.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
petitioner
was,
in
fact,
now
transferred
to
an
adult
penal
institution.
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
he
was
originally
committed
to
the
industrial
school
for
--
until
he
reached
the
age
of
21,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
statutory
maximum?
justice
potter
stewart
this
subsequent
transfer
to
the
adult
penal
institution,
did
that
or
could
that
increase
the
length
of
the
term
of
his
custody?
justice
potter
stewart
they
committed
him
two
days
before
this
man's
21st
birthday,
could
it
be
then
for
an
additional
two
years?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
any
event
it's
your
submission
that
that
matter
is
not
before
us
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
--
that's
so
called
custody
however
would
be
in
a
foster
home,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
fourth
category
provided
by
the
statutes
of
your
state
seems
to
be
a
child
in
need
of
special
supervision.
you
have
a
neglected
child,
the
dependent
child,
the
delinquent
child
and
fourthly,
a
child
in
need
of
special
supervision.
how
is
such
a
child
handles
under
your
procedures?
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
very
same
place
that
this
kid
has
been
sent?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
juvenile
court
in
your
county
is
just
the
same
judge
with
the
different
hat
on,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
in
the
city
like
omaha,
special
juvenile
court?
justice
potter
stewart
just
while
interrupted
you,
i
suppose
that
often
there
is
a
or
at
least
infrequently,
there
maybe
a
adversity
of
interest
between
the
juvenile's
parents
and
the
juvenile?
is
that
true
often
that
parents
be
complaining
witnesses,
is
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
have
absolute
discretion
on
that
as
i
understand
it
if
you
asking
on
it
what,
48
hours
or
something?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
have
discretion
with
respect
to
a
juvenile,
what,
between
16
and
18
or
what
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
it
is
a
10-year-old
boy?
justice
potter
stewart
you
would?
justice
potter
stewart
any
and
what
if
it's
--
but
the
discretion
was
stopped
at
some
age
or
what
if
it's
a
50-year-old
man,
you
don't
have
discretion
of
bringing
him
before
the
juvenile
court?
justice
potter
stewart
but
18
and
below,
you
have
discretion
to
initiate
juvenile
proceedings
or
to
initiate
criminal
proceedings
in
the
criminal
court
no
matter
how
tender
the
age?
justice
potter
stewart
so
far
as
this
statute
goes?
justice
potter
stewart
in
your
state,
i
suppose
person
has
to
be
21
years
or
older
than
the
juror,
is
he?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
any
event
you
could
not
have
teenage
juror?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
take
any
position
on
the
burden
of
proof?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
there
would
be
a
trial
de
novo
in
the
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
did
not
happen
in
this
case,
you
tell
us?
justice
potter
stewart
state
habeas
corpus.
justice
potter
stewart
state
habeas
corpus.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
there
was
no
direct
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
line,
i'm
looking
at
the
record
here.
i
don't
see
that
you
raised
in
the
trial
in
the
juvenile
court
this
question
of
burden
of
proof
or
the
degree
of
proof?
justice
potter
stewart
and
does
it
appear
that
the
county,
that
the
juvenile
judge
applied
any
standard
of
proof
other
than
proof
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt?
you
are
just
relying
on
what
the
statute
does?
justice
potter
stewart
he
didn't
say
one
word?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
did
not
object
on
that
ground?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
yours
statement
along
those
lines
beginning
of
your
argument
today
that
that
let
me
look
at
this
record
and
to
wonder
if
you
would
objected
to
that?
that
was
of
course
discussed
and
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
but,
i
wonder
if
it
really
is
in

justice

the

was
