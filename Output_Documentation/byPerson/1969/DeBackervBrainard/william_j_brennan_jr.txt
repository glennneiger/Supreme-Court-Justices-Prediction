a
repeat

proceeding

mr.
line,
may
i
open
up
with
you
again
the
question
of
retroactivity?
if
we
were
able
--
were
to
say
that
we
ought
not
reach
the
question
here
because
at
any
event,
destefano
--
how
would
you
pronounce
that
--
would
deny
this
appellant
a
jury
trial
but
were
agree
with
you
that
the
have
to
be
reversal
on
one
of
the
other
grounds
burden
of
proof
was
the
case
maybe,
what
do
you
conceive
would
be
the
situation
on
retrial
and
matter
of
the
jury
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
just
that
--
we
say,
we
can't
reach
issue
of
jury
trial
there.
since
at
any
event,
i
couldn't
apply
and
we
don't
decide
the
issue
of
jury
trial
in
juvenile
court
proceedings
because
bloom
and
duncan
were
not
retroactive.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
we
do
reverse
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
example
as
premise
one
of
the
other
grounds
so
there
has
to
be
a
retrial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
know,
what
y
our
argument
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
--
the
premise
is
that
we
don't
agree
with
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
know,
you
know
mr.
line
that
in
miranda
warning
area
we
have
said
that
on
retrial,
the
miranda
who
did
not
apply.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
your
basic
argument?
