well,
some
deal

that

it
would
not
be
retroactive
beyond
what,
may
20,
1968?
justice

but
this
document
said
they’re
point
in
trials
beginning
after
may

1968.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
how
do
you
get
around
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
true,
but
even
if
it
was
the
sixth
amendment
wouldn’t
bind
the
states
to
give
a
jury
trial
at
the
time
of
gault.
justice
byron

and
it
wouldn’t
until
may

1968,
i
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
rely
on
the
sixth
amendment
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
concede
it
involves
an
act
to
be
violating
a
criminal
statute--
they
concede
it
involves--
justice
byron
r.
white
violating
the
criminal
statute
performed
by
the
boy.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
matter
taken
up
in
the
court,
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska?
it's
a
matter
of
your
discretion?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
court
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
courts
in
nebraska
construed
it
all
of
it's
or
dealt
with
this
area
of
discretion?
do
they
say
it's
absolute
or
it
is
unreviewable
or
it
is
reviewable
by
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
standardless
discretion?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
appellate
route?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
couldn't
get
a
jury
in
the
district
court
either?
justice
byron
r.
white
the

judge?
justice
byron
r.
white
over
the
--
over
the
objection
of
the
prosecutor
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
how
about
retroactivity
which
you
said
was
injected
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
said
that
the
sixth
amendment
didn't
apply
to
the
states
until
may
20,
1968?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
doesn't
quite
make
a
--
he
doesn't
either
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
or
his
brief
argue
the
equal
protection
clause,
but
he
does
arrive
at
the
same
result
through
the
discretion
argument
to
that
adults
have
jury
trials
and
he
wants
to
have
a
jury
trial,
why
the
prosecutor
is
going
to
turn
him
down,
he
should
have
some
decent
reasons
for
it.
justice
byron

and
besides,
the
quantum
of
the
evidence
in
this
case
as

as
the
judge
passing
on
it
is
concerned
is
that
you
said
it

you
too
much?
