mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
national
council
of
juvenile
court
judges
appears
today
as
amicus
to
support
the
contention
of
the
appellee
with
the
sixth
amendment
as
incorporated
through
the
fourteenth,
does
not
require
a
jury
trial
in
juvenile
adjudications
of
delinquency.
and
secondly,
to
support
its
claim
that
the
transfer
or
the
exercise
of
the
prosecutor's
discretion
to
try
a
child
as
a
juvenile
rather
than
to
accuse
him
as
a
criminal
violated
no
requirement
of
due
process.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
no
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
do
not
for
several
reasons.
frankly
in
this
area
at
least,
it
seems
to
me
the
quantum
of
proof
formula
become
more
semantic
than
ever.
most
juvenile
court
judges
i'd
to
say
as
dean
paulson
points
out,
are
not
going
to
find
the
child
guilty
of
the
act
of
which
he's
accused,
unless
he
is
really
convinced
the
boy
did
the
act
and
i
think
--
i
don't
think
it
is
a
matter
of
great
moment.
if
this
court
decides
that
the
sixth
amendment
through
the
fourteenth
requires
a
jury
trial
it
would
seem
to
me
quite
obvious
that
you
would
follow
it
with
the
reasonable
doubts
standard.
but
if
the
court
--
i
can
see
the
court
being
troubled
by
the
actual
adjudication
of
delinquency
in
this
case.
a
subsequent
nebraska
case
to
which
we
refer
in
our
brief
guy
versus
bishop
at
page
8,
in
our
view
at
least
and
in
the
view
of
the
dissenting
judge
there,
seem
that
the
parts
somewhat
from
the
stricter
preponderance
of
proof.
now,
it
is
possible
if
the
nebraska
court
got
another
look
at
that
particular
issue
in
this
case,
it
might
reach
a
different
result
that.
unfortunately,
the
appellant
elected
to
come
to
habeas
corpus
route.
he
has
chose
to
bring
the
direct
appeal
or
it
would
have
had
a
trial
de
novo
in
the
district
court,
and
then
again
at
--
i
was
amazed
to
find
in
the
nebraska
that
supreme
court
has
rather
broad
powers
in
civil
cases
on
the
equity
side
in
reviewing
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
so,
that
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
question
as
i
read
this
record
was
never
squarely
presented
to
the
nebraska
supreme
court.
i
would
think
since
four
judges
went
for
him
among
the
constitutional
grounds
he
probably
would
have
won
the
case
if
he
went
that
way,
but
i
don't
know
what
the
nebraska
supreme
court
would
do
if
it
went
back
in
that
posture.
maybe
they,
in
nebraska
like
most
states
you
can't
use
habeas
corpus
as
a
substitute
for
appeal,
i
don't
know
what
they
do.
i
suppose
it
much
would
depend
if
there
was
a
mandate
from
this
court
on
the
particular
issue.
so
for
those
reasons,
we
have
not
taken
up
the
standard
of
proof
point.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
the
appellate
route
is
one
of
careful
protection
mr.
justice
white.
there
would
have
been
an
appeal
from
the
adjudication
of
the
juvenile
court
judge
here
to
the
district
court,
and
there,
there
would
be
a
trial
de
novo.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
not
with
the
jury,
not
with
the
jury.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
that's
right.
he
couldn't
get
a
jury,
i
don't
mean
that
to
imply
that
and
that's
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
i
gather
it
is,
i
gather
it
is.
it's
a
statute
that
goes
a
long
way
in
protecting
the
juvenile.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
no
in
this
--
no
because
in
this
county
particularly,
you
only
have
like
a
county
judge,
it
would
not
be
the
same
judge.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
correct.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
oh
no,
this
was
a
habeas
corpus.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
that's
correct.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
that's
right,
in
the
district
court.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
just
the
constitutional
issues
presented
to
it,
not
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
question.
we
turn
then
to
--
i'm
out
of
it
--
well,
i
guess,
we
injected
into
the
case,
the
retroactivity
issue.
as
i
understand
that
mr.
line's
position,
he
stated
it
very
candidly
yesterday,
it's
sort
of
a
simplistic
syllogism.
duncan
versus
louisiana
and
bloom
versus
the
united
states
require
a
jury
trial
in
this
serious
criminal
matter.
deprivation
of
a
child
of
his
liberty
is
a
serious
criminal
matter,
q.e.d;
a
jury
trial
is
required
in
adjudications
of
delinquency
of
this
type.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
i
think
he
would
say
and
we
would
admit
mr.
justice
blank
that
a
proceeding
that
deprived
the
child
of
his
liberty
up
to
his
21st
birthday
was
a
serious
matter.
now,
i
don't
think
it's
important
in
this
case
that
we
bog
down
and
label
as
if
--
we
want
the
--
those
that
support
juvenile
court
jurisdiction
have
been
accused
of
using
labels
to
justify
their
conclusion
that
jury
trials
are
not
required
in
such
proceedings,
but
i
think
this
other
side
is
guilty
of
the
same
thing.
juvenile
court
jurisprudence
is
something
quite
different,
whether
it
finds
its
origins
in
the
english
equity
courts
or
whether
it
has
a
relationship
to
american
criminal
justice,
i
don't
think
it's
too
important.
it's
a
creation
of
idealistic
reformers.
the
reforms
might
have
bogged
down
here
and
there
but
it
is
something
different.
it's
like
america
administrative
law
is
something
different.
it's
a
civil
proceeding,
but
it's
different.
similarly,
i
think
a
juvenile
court
jurisprudence,
juvenile
court
justice
is
something
different
either
from
the
parents
patriarch
business
or
from
criminal
justice
and
i
think
a
decision
has
to
be
made,
does
the
insertion
of
the
jury
system
with
all
of
it's
delays,
it's
horrendous
delays,
is
the
insertion
of
that
system
into
the
juvenile
court
system.
is
that
going
to
contribute
materially
to
the
integrity
of
the
efficacy
of
the
fact
finding
process?
is
it
going
to
confer
any
substantial
benefit
on
the
child
or
rather
might
it
not
do
some
harm?
now,
mr.
justice
marshall
talks
about
it
only
takes
money.
it
takes
money
in
time.
the
district
of
columbia
is
--
how
many
judges
can
you
pour
into
this
situation
and
for
what
benefit?
the
adverse
publicity
of
a
trial,
the
sixth
amendment
says
“public
trial,”
i'm
not
going
to
have
quiet
little
jury
trials,
“public
trials.”
i
don't
see
how
that
can
be
advantageous
to
children
in
most
instances?
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
yes
mr.
justice
marshall,
a
juvenile
could
waive
a
public
trial.
he
could
waive
a
jury
trial
as
mr.
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
oh!
i
was
contemplating
the
situation
mr.
justice
marshall
envisioned.
in
other
words,
we
had
a
jury
trial
provided
by
statute.
i
didn't
--
he
said
said
by
requirement
of
constitution
by
statute
and
his
question
was
couldn't
he
waive,
and
i
would
have
to
say,
yes
he
could.
he
could
waive
the
jury
trial.
he
could
waive
the
public
aspect
of
the
sixth
amendment
protections
of
the
jury
trial
certainly.
but
for
the
few
children
for
whom
that
might
be
at
some
benefit,
why
do
we
have
to
undermine
the
whole
system?
giving
the
jury
trial,
none
of
the
evils
at
which
this
court
decision
in
gault
was
directed
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
yes,
i
never
did
answer
that,
i'm
sorry.
i
would
say
that
in
destefano
versus
the
united
states,
this
court
decided
that
it
would
not
apply
duncan
versus
louisiana
retroactively.
in
destefano,
there
was
an
attempt
to
expand
the
right
of
jury
trial.
the
precise
question
in
that
case
was
that
whether
having
less
than
the
unanimous
jury
in
a
non
capital
case
violated
the
sixth
amendment.
this
was
a
new
question.
this
was
going
beyond
duncan,
but
this
court
did
not
go
beyond
duncan
and
destefano,
rather
it
said
no.
we're
not
going
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
now,
it
seems
to
me
anomalous
to
say
--
to
hold
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
adult
criminals
until
may
20,
1968,
but
would
apply
to
juvenile
criminals
earlier
than
that
date.
the
fact
that
the
nebraska
supreme
court
didn't
consider
it,
you
honor
i
think
it's
easily
explained
by
the
fact
that
it's
never
presented
to
it.
actually,
i
think
the
case
wasn't
argued
in
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
after
--
before
destefano
was
even
decided.
i
think
that's
the
counters
right
on
that.
so,
i
just
think,
if
his
whole
case
is
--
i
stand
on
duncan
versus
louisiana,
they
gave
us
the
right,
i'm
entitled
to
that
right.
it
seems
to
me
if
you
take
duncan
versus
louisiana
as
the
basis
of
your
claim
that
you
have
a
jury
trial
right,
you
have
to
take
the
restrictions
on
duncan
versus
louisiana
as
annunciated
by
this
court
in
destefano
versus
the
united
states.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
with
respect
to
equal
protection
the
amicus
of
course
wouldn't
as
the
question
wasn't
raised
in
that
context,
but
that
that's
put
that
aside.
it
seems
to
me
the
answer
to
the
equal
protection
objection
is
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
show
that
children
can
be
treated
differently
from
adults
with
respect
to
the
application
of
the
constitutional
rights
if
it's
for
their
benefits.
or
the
case
is
not
that,
the
case
here
this
morning
is
not
as
mr.
line
said
is
the
constitution
for
adults
only.
we
only
need
to
go
back
to
the
ginsberg
case
and
the
prince
case
where
this
court
certainly
did
not
give
a
child
the
protections
which
free
speech
would
give
an
adult
or
the
protections
which
the
free
exercise
of
religion
clause
would
give
an
adult.
so
clearly,
the
question
is,
is
this
a
reasonable
classification?
children
are
treated
differently
because
they
have
a
condition
of
immaturity.
it
distinguishes
to
them
from
adults.
as
a
result
of
that
condition
and
other
factors
working
on
it,
they
get
in
situations
where
for
their
own
benefit
the
society
must
do
something.
the
system
that
is
growing
up
with
all
its
imperfections
to
deal
with
children
on
a
different
basis
than
adults
is
the
juvenile
court
system.
is
that
an
unreasonable
classification?
it
seems
to
me
when
you
have
the
congress
pushing
to
repeal
the
jury
trial
right
in
the
district
of
columbia,
now,
i
don't
know
what
reception
that
will
get.
but
there
the
congress
is
taking
up
this
matter.
in
the
name
of
heaven,
can
those
legislatures
that
elected
never
to
get
in
that
tickle
in
the
first
place
have
violated
due
process
of
law?
i
don't
think
they
have.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan

it

the

there,

mr.

not

not

mr.

that's
right.
he
couldn't

i
don't

and
that's
--
mr.

it's

mr.

no

mr.

correct.
mr.

oh
no,
this
was
a
habeas

mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
that's
correct.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
that's
right,
in
the
district
court.
mr.
alfred

just
the
constitutional
issues
presented
to

not
the

of

a
serious
matter.
now,
i
don't
think
it's
important
in
this
case
that
we
bog
down
and
label
as
if
--
we
want
the
--
those
that
support
juvenile
court
jurisdiction
have
been
accused
of
using
labels
to
justify
their
conclusion
that
jury
trials
are
not
required
in
such
proceedings,
but
i
think
this
other
side
is
guilty
of
the
same
thing.
juvenile
court
jurisprudence
is
something
quite
different,
whether
it
finds
its
origins
in
the
english
equity
courts
or
whether
it
has
a
relationship
to
american
criminal
justice,
i
don't
think
it's
too
important.
it's
a
creation
of
idealistic
reformers.
the
reforms
might
have
bogged
down
here
and
there
but
it
is
something
different.
it's
like
america
administrative
law
is
something
different.
it's
a
civil
proceeding,
but
it's
different.
similarly,
i
think
a
juvenile
court
jurisprudence,
juvenile
court
justice
is
something
different
either
from
the
parents
patriarch
business
or
from
criminal
justice
and
i
think
a
decision
has
to
be
made,
does
the
insertion
of
the
jury
system
with
all
of
it's
delays,
it's
horrendous
delays,
is
the
insertion
of
that
system
into
the
juvenile
court
system.
is
that
going
to
contribute
materially
to
the
integrity
of
the
efficacy
of
the
fact
finding
process?
is
it
going
to
confer
any
substantial
benefit
on
the
child
or
rather
might
it
not
do
some
harm?
now,
mr.
justice
marshall
talks
about
it
only
takes
money.
it
takes
money
in
time.
the
district
of
columbia
is
--
how
many
judges
can
you
pour
into
this
situation
and
for
what
benefit?
the
adverse
publicity
of
a
trial,
the
sixth
amendment
says
“public
trial,”
i'm
not
going
to
have
quiet
little
jury
trials,
“public
trials.”
i
don't
see
how
that
can
be
advantageous
to
children
in
most
instances?
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
yes
mr.
justice
marshall,
a
juvenile
could
waive
a
public
trial.
he
could
waive
a
jury
trial
as
mr.
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
oh!
i
was
contemplating
the
situation
mr.
justice
marshall
envisioned.
in
other
words,
we
had
a
jury
trial
provided
by
statute.
i
didn't
--
he
said
said
by
requirement
of
constitution
by
statute
and
his
question
was
couldn't
he
waive,
and
i
would
have
to
say,
yes
he
could.
he
could
waive
the
jury
trial.
he
could
waive
the
public
aspect
of
the
sixth
amendment
protections
of
the
jury
trial
certainly.
but
for
the
few
children
for
whom
that
might
be
at
some
benefit,
why
do
we
have
to
undermine
the
whole
system?
giving
the
jury
trial,
none
of
the
evils
at
which
this
court
decision
in
gault
was
directed
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
yes,
i
never
did
answer
that,
i'm
sorry.
i
would
say
that
in
destefano
versus
the
united
states,
this
court
decided
that
it
would
not
apply
duncan
versus
louisiana
retroactively.
in
destefano,
there
was
an
attempt
to
expand
the
right
of
jury
trial.
the
precise
question
in
that
case
was
that
whether
having
less
than
the
unanimous
jury
in
a
non
capital
case
violated
the
sixth
amendment.
this
was
a
new
question.
this
was
going
beyond
duncan,
but
this
court
did
not
go
beyond
duncan
and
destefano,
rather
it
said
no.
we're
not
going
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
now,
it
seems
to
me
anomalous
to
say
--
to
hold
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
adult
criminals
until
may
20,
1968,
but
would
apply
to
juvenile
criminals
earlier
than
that
date.
the
fact
that
the
nebraska
supreme
court
didn't
consider
it,
you
honor
i
think
it's
easily
explained
by
the
fact
that
it's
never
presented
to
it.
actually,
i
think
the
case
wasn't
argued
in
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
after
--
before
destefano
was
even
decided.
i
think
that's
the
counters
right
on
that.
so,
i
just
think,
if
his
whole
case
is
--
i
stand
on
duncan
versus
louisiana,
they
gave
us
the
right,
i'm
entitled
to
that
right.
it
seems
to
me
if
you
take
duncan
versus
louisiana
as
the
basis
of
your
claim
that
you
have
a
jury
trial
right,
you
have
to
take
the
restrictions
on
duncan
versus
louisiana
as
annunciated
by
this
court
in
destefano
versus
the
united
states.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
with
respect
to
equal
protection
the
amicus
of
course
wouldn't
as
the
question
wasn't
raised
in
that
context,
but
that
that's
put
that
aside.
it
seems
to
me
the
answer
to
the
equal
protection
objection
is
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
show
that
children
can
be
treated
differently
from
adults
with
respect
to
the
application
of
the
constitutional
rights
if
it's
for
their
benefits.
or
the
case
is
not
that,
the
case
here
this
morning
is
not
as
mr.
line
said
is
the
constitution
for
adults
only.
we
only
need
to
go
back
to
the
ginsberg
case
and
the
prince
case
where
this
court
certainly
did
not
give
a
child
the
protections
which
free
speech
would
give
an
adult
or
the
protections
which
the
free
exercise
of
religion
clause
would
give
an
adult.
so
clearly,
the
question
is,
is
this
a
reasonable
classification?
children
are
treated
differently
because
they
have
a
condition
of
immaturity.
it
distinguishes
to
them
from
adults.
as
a
result
of
that
condition
and
other
factors
working
on
it,
they
get
in
situations
where
for
their
own
benefit
the
society
must
do
something.
the
system
that
is
growing
up
with
all
its
imperfections
to
deal
with
children
on
a
different
basis
than
adults
is
the
juvenile
court
system.
is
that
an
unreasonable
classification?
it
seems
to
me
when
you
have
the
congress
pushing
to
repeal
the
jury
trial
right
in
the
district
of
columbia,
now,
i
don't
know
what
reception
that
will
get.
but
there
the
congress
is
taking
up
this
matter.
in
the
name
of
heaven,
can
those
legislatures
that
elected
never
to
get
in
that
tickle
in
the
first
place
have
violated
due
process
of
law?
i
don't
think
they
have.
thank
you
your
honor.
