justice
thurgood
marshall
is
an
institutional
hearing
held
in
the
penitentiary?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
did
they
have
outsiders
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean
when
you
say
hearing,
if
all
the
hearing
amounts
to
as
a
warden
calls
him
in
and
talks
to
him,
you
wouldn't
call
a
hearing,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
said
hearing
and
the
amount
--
can
you
tell
me
how
much
of
a
hearing
it
is
or
do
you
know?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
the
cost,
they
only
handle
40
a
year,
wasn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
less
than
one
week?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
ways
submission
to
the
readings
of
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
say
an
explanation
for
the
reason
they
don't
need
the
whole
one
week.
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
that
be
remedied
by
more
court
rooms?
justice
thurgood
marshall
more
judges?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
can
be
remedied
by
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
can
be
remedied
by
money,
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
it
was
a
thousand,
they
could
be
handled
by
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
other
point,
what
about
the
fact,
is
that
not
true
that
the
--
all
of
these
benefits
that
accrue
from
the
standard
juvenile
court
proceedings,
isn't
it
possible
that
these
juvenile
or
his
lawyer
or
his
parents
could
waive
the
jury
trial
and
accept
all
of
those
nice
benefits?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
could
waive
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
all
of
this
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
juvenile?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
the
juvenile
wants
of
all
of
that
benefit.
he
can
get
it
by
merely
not
asking
for
a
jury
trial,
am
i
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
what's
wrong
with
allowing
him
to
have
a
jury
trial
if
he
wants
to
waive
all
those
benefits?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
is
possible
that
they
were
also
discussing
it
with
the
parents?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
not
be
the
usual
gang?
justice
thurgood
marshall
juvenile,
the
parents
and
the
lawyer,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
decide
that
they
want
a
jury?
they
want
to
give
up
all
these
benefits.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
after
the
jury
trial,
the
judge
could
still
give
him
all
of
these
benefits.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
talking
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
claim
for
the
jury
trial.
i'm
just
talking
practically,
there
is
very
little
problem
there,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
view
will
be
thought,
doesn't
the
in
the
regular
proceeding
is
it
normal
for
the
judge
to
ask
the
parents
about
what
they
think,
not
that
he
is
bound
by
the
thought.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
it
would
be
jury
would
find
that,
say
they
find
the
juvenile
delinquent
and
the
judge
talks
it
over
the
time
says,
i
really
don't
think
this
anything
or
behaved
by
putting
this
boy
away
out.
do
what
they
would
normally
do.
nothing
is
lost,
but
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
say,
i
don't
think
anything
is
lost,
but
the
cost
of
the
state
of
summoning
the
jury.
what
else
is
lost?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
which,
he,
his
family
and
his
lawyer
agree
they
want?
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn't
a
juvenile
waive
the
public
trial?
justice
thurgood

is
an
institutional
hearing
