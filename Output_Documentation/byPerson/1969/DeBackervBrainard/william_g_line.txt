mr.
william
g.

mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
g.
line
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
question
of
whether
equal
justice
under
law
means
for
adults
only.
clarence
debacker
is
in
the
nebraska
state
reformatory
as
the
result
of
a
petition
files
against
him
in
the
juvenile
court
of
dodge
county,
nebraska
alleging
his
delinquency
because
of
the
uttering
of
a
possession
of
a
forged
check
within
intent
to
utter
as
genuine.
a
jury
trial
was
demanded
and
denied
because
a
nebraska
juvenile
court
act
says
that
juvenile
delinquency
cases
will
be
handled
without
a
jury
and
a
quantum
of
proof
is
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
habeas
corpus
was
sought
in
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
it
was
denied
and
the
nebraska
supreme
court
in
a
4-3
decision,
it
was
a
type
of
decision
where
the
minority
prevailed,
held
that
the
nebraska
juvenile
court
act
met
federal
constitutional
requirements.
nebraska
has
a
state
constitutional
provision
requiring
a
concurrence
of
five
judges
to
declare
a
state
statute
invalid.
the
position
of
the
appellant
in
this
case
has
been
referred
to
by
some
of
the
adversaries
and
amicus
curiaes
as
being
simplistic
and,
without
the
evil
connotations
of
the
word,
it
is
precisely
that.
since
this
court’s
decision
in
duncan,
in
bloom,
in
gault,
a
proceeding
where
a
person
can
wind
up
in
a
penal
institution
for
more
than
six
months
surely
has
all
the
attributes
of
a
serious
felony
case.
mr.
william
g.
line
he
was
tried
in
april
of--
actually,
february
or
march
1968
before
duncan
and
bloom
were
decided.
mr.
william
g.
line
i
don’t
think
they’re
even
relevant
on
the
retroactivity.
i
realize
that
they’re
not
retroactive.
mr.
william
g.
line
they
were--
mr.
william
g.
line
right.
mr.
william
g.
line
may
20,
1968.
this
case
was
orally
argued
in
the
nebraska
supreme
court
on
may
29,
1968.
mr.
william
g.
line
right.
mr.
justice
white,
the
position--
mr.
william
g.
line
well,
gault
left
open
the
question
of
whether
there
was--
a
juvenile
delinquency
case
was
in
fact
a
criminal
case.
mr.
william
g.
line
well,
they
wouldn’t
at
the
time
of
gault,
but--
mr.
william
g.
line
my
argument
is
based
on
this
premise.
that--
mr.
william
g.
line
you
have
to
rely
on
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
william
g.
line
and
on
the
equal
protection
clause--
mr.
william
g.
line
well--
mr.
william
g.
line
for
example,
an
adult
in
nebraska
due
to
nebraska
constitutional
procedures,
the
statutory
decisions,
you
get
two
jury
trials
for
running
a
stop
sign,
six-man
jury
in
the
lower
court,
the
12
men
jury
on
appeal
to
the
district
court.
so,
that
argument
also
we
do
rely
on
of
course.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
new
case
basically,
and
until
this
court
decides
this
question,
this
is
the
case
that
will--
should
decide
once
and
for
all
whether
these
labels
that
everyone
is
so
fund
of
are--
mean
anything
anymore.
what
this
case
is
not
about
of
course
is
the
rehabilitative
features
of
the
juvenile
court.
no
one
has
pointed
out,
in
my
opinion,
any
reason
why
a
jury
trial
or
an
adjudication
based
upon
a
criminal
standard
of
proof
will
interfere
one
with
the
ennoble
benevolent
features
of
the
juvenile
court
system.
for
example,
i
can
imagine
a
juvenile
court
judge
who
has
a
delinquent
before
him
being
able
to
be
much
more
parens
patriae
if
he
hasn’t
convicted
him.
surely,
he
can
say
“you
have
been
convicted
by
a
jury
of
your
peers.
now,
let’s
see
what
we
can
do
about
you,”
and
the
juvenile
is
up
to
feel
less
resentment
at
the
juvenile
court
process
if
he
has
been
convicted
by
his
fellow
citizens
with
a
standard
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
william
g.
line
that,
i
think,
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
the
magic
of
the
whole
system.
mr.
william
g.
line
is
the
magic
of
the
whole
system.
i
think
that’s
the
reason
he
ought
to
have
it.
very
occasionally,
judges
think
people
should
be
convicted
and
juries
think
they
shouldn’t,
and
that’s
the
way
it
works
out.
mr.
william
g.
line
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
juvenile
court
system
means
anything
at
all,
the
theory,
as
i
understand
it,
is
you’re
not
suppose
to
punish
him.
you’re
supposed
to
rehabilitate
him.
of
course,
i
think
modern
penology
is
supposed
to
be
arriving
at
that
theory
too.
we--
the
thumb
screw
and
the
right
and
so
forth,
we
understood
it
in
rehabilitation.
it
seems
to
me
that
it--
the
juvenile
court
can
still
function.
that
merely
because
you
give
a
boy
a
constitutional
right
to
be
tried
by
a
jury,
that
you
don’t
then
necessarily
have
to
take
away
from
him
whatever
benefits
he
had
remained.
mr.
william
g.
line
i--
mr.
william
g.
line
no
question
about
it.
that
was
the--
mr.
william
g.
line
it
can
be,
but
i
submit
not
near
as
traumatic
as
winding
up
in
a
penal
institution
on
the
say
so
of
one
man
when
you
have
asked
for
a
jury
trial
and
on
the
basis
of
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
i
think
that
is
so
much
more
traumatic
than
a--
mr.
william
g.
line
that
is
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
the
argument
to
that
effect
is
made
earnestly,
but
i
don’t
believe
realistically,
mr.
chief
justice,
90%
or
more
criminal
cases
throughout
this
country
are
disposed
of
on
pleas
of
guilty.
juvenile
cases--
the
argument
is
made
in
the
amicus
curiae
briefs.
one
reason
that
this
court
shouldn’t
grant
a
jury
trial
is
because
it
has
been
considered
so
invaluable
it’s
never
been
demanded.
i
think
a
reference
is
made
at
denver
where
there
were
only
very
few
requests
made
over
period
of
years.
and
then
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
they
say,
“on
the
other
hand,
if
you
do
make
it
available
nationwide
then
it
will
be
in
such
demand
that
the
system
will
breakdown.
we
won’t
be
able
to
administrate.
we
won’t
be
able
to
do
this
and
we
won’t
be
able
to
do
that,
and--
mr.
william
g.
line
that
is
true
and,
again,
if
the--
surely,
the
availability
of
jury
trial
cannot
depend
upon
the
administrative
convenience
of
a
court
or--
mr.
william
g.
line
mr.
chief
justice,
you’ve
run
a
ringer
on
me--
in
on
me
on
bail
because
that
is
not
an
issue
that
i
am--
that
i
have
addressed
myself
to.
mr.
william
g.
line
and,
that
is
not
presented
by
this
case.
mr.
william
g.
line
it’s
part
of
the
whole
problem
but
then,
right
there,
i
think
you
get
into
a
whole
new
issue.
it’s--
probably,
people
are
acutely
aware
of
it
now
because
i
read
in
the
paper
after
i
got
here
about
the
juvenile
crime
involving
dropping
a
rock
over--
off
an
overpass
where
he’d
been
out
on
bail.
and
so,
that
becomes
fresh
in
a
person’s
mind
but,
again,
bail
is
something
that
shouldn’t
perhaps
be
just
automatic.
certainly,
society
can
protect
itself
from
people
who
are
psychiatrically
disturbed.
if
they
think
there’s
going
to
be
a
high
risk
of
danger
to
society,
we--
the
system
should
be
able
to
take
care
of
that.
the
fact
that
there
are
problems
and
that
perhaps
if
this
court
decides
that
a
juvenile
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial,
the
fact
that
perhaps
it
might
be
used
as
a
decision
to
later
decision
that
bail
rights
should
be
enlarged
i
think
is,
i
respectfully
suggest,
one
step
at
a
time.
here,
i
think
the
realities
of
the
situation
are--
duncan
said
the
purpose
of
the
jury
trial
is
to
provide
protection
against
an
arbitrary
persecutor
or
a
biased
judge.
most
attorneys,
i
think,
are
willing
to
wave
jury
trial
for
juvenile.
you’re
not
going
to,
as
his
counsel,
you’re
not
going
to
put
him
through
this
traumatic
experience
unless
you
think
that
it’s
in
his
best
interest.
i
wanted
to
put
debacker
through
the
traumatic
experience
because
i
was
satisfied--
it
was
my
judgment
that
he
would
be
acquitted,
although
he
was
typically--
mr.
william
g.
line
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
line
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
g.
line
that
was
going
into
the
dispositional
stage,
mr.
justice
stewart.
it
was
not
referred
to
before
the
juvenile
court
judge
made
his
adjudication,
and
our
statute
statutorily
declares
a
person
delinquent
if
he
violates
a
statute
of
the
state
or
a
municipal
ordinance.
i
mean,
it’s--
debacker
was
declared
a
delinquent
because
he
violated
the
forged
check
statute.
then,
after
that,
the
judge
did
go
into
his
background,
prior
offenses,
prior
troubles
with
the
law
in
deciding
apparently
to
commit
him
summarily
to
the
boy’s
training
school,
but
it
was
not
an
issue
and
the
proceeding
was
not
founded
on
the
basis
that
he
was
delinquent
generally.
he
was
delinquent
because
of
a
forged
check.
mr.
william
g.
line
no,
they--
there’s
a
special
supervision
portion
of
the
statute
and--
your
honor,
no.
it
has
to
be--
he
has
to
be--
violated
any
law
of
a
state
of
any
city
or
a
village
ordinance.
if
he’s
hopeless,
homeless,
or
destitute,
he’s
under
section
43201.
he
is
a
dependent
child.
he’s
a--
mr.
william
g.
line
yes.
mr.
william
g.
line
yes,
subdivision
4,
delinquent
child
shall
mean
any
child
under
the
age
of
18
years
who
has
violated
any
law
of
the
state
or
any
city
or
village
ordinance.
section
5,
yes,
a
child
in
need
of
special
supervision
shall
mean
a
child
who
is
under
the
age
of
18
years
and
is
wayward,
habitually
truant,
deports
himself
so
as
to
endanger
his
morals
or
the
morals
of
others.
mr.
william
g.
line
i
believe
that
he
could
if--
but
not
as
a
delinquent.
mr.
william
g.
line
that’s
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
g.
line
i
think
there
is
a
difference.
a
child
in
need
of
special
supervision,
seems
to
me,
to
be
a
child
in
a
status
more
than--
a
delinquent
child
is
a
child
who,
by
his
voluntary
volitional
conduct,
has
violated
the
law
of
a
state.
i
think
that
it
wouldn’t
necessarily
apply
to
a
child
in
need
of
special
supervision.
for
example,
if
a
child
is
found
on
a
doorstep
and
becomes
a
ward
of
the
juvenile
court,
i
mean,
the
child
doesn’t
need
a
jury
trial
to
determine
whether
or
not
somebody
will
look
after
him.
mr.
william
g.
line
alright.
mr.
william
g.
line
i
think
so.
i
have
some
difficulty
with
this
concept
of
how
you
determine
in
advance
how
serious
a
case
is
going
to
be,
as
to
whether
the
jury
trial
is
going
to
be
available.
what--
i
think
if
you--
if
it’s
contemplated
in
the
process
with
this
child
that
he’s
going
to
be
confined
for
more
than
six
months,
then
he
ought
to
have
a
jury
trial.
mr.
william
g.
line
well,
who’d
make
the
decision
in--
you
say
in
the
gray
area?
mr.
william
g.
line
well--
mr.
william
g.
line
well,
first
of
all,
it
would
be--
i
think
it
would
require
demand
of
the
juvenile’s
counsel.
second,
i
suppose
then
it
requires
the
judge
to
search
his
mind
and
determine
what
he’s
going
to
do
with
the
child
and
there,
frankly,
i
have
difficulty.
the
frank
case
that
referred
to
probation
being
impossible
for
over
six
months
without
a
jury
trial
and
then
if
the
probation
is
violated
only
a
sentence
of
six
months
could
be
imposed.
it’s--
i
don’t
know
how
a
judge
can
determine
a
case--
what
he’s
going
to
do
with
the
person
before
him
until
he
knows
what
the
facts
of
the
case
are
but,
apparently,
it
can
be
done.
mr.
william
g.
line
well,
i
think
that
is
perhaps
more
the
consideration
but,
certainly,
a
juvenile
court
judge
is
no
particular
expert
in
deciding
whether
or
not
debacker
forged
the
check
or
broke
into
a
filling
station.
that,
i
think,
is
still
within
the
traditional
competence
of
the
jury.
mr.
william
g.
line
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
a
few
comments
would
be
in
order
on
the
point
if
i'm
not
making
a
direct
appeal
from
the
juvenile
court,
and
it's
been
pointed
out
that
i
did
not
attack
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
of
course
the
reason
that
is
obvious.
the
evidence
is
more
insufficient
to
sustain
conviction
of
what
he
did
and
appeal
on
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
would
have
been
close
to
frivolous.
the
jury
question
was
another
matter.
when
this
boy's
mother
told
him
to
sign
his
father's
name
to
the
check
and
that
would
have
been
established
in
front
of
a
jury
of
citizens
in
the
community,
i
believe
that
they
would
have
exercise
the
pardoning
power
that
jurors
want
to
exercise.
mr.
william
g.
line
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
obvious
that
there
would
be
situations
where
the
--
that
the
child
is
adversary
to
the
parent
and
it
existed
in
the
case.
the
child
is
adversary
to
the
father.
mr.
william
g.
line
i
think
in
--
certainly.
i
don't
know
what
the
percentage
would
be,
but
it
could
--
if
it's
as
highest
as
25
or
30%
of
the
cases,
it's
substantial
percentage
and
would
present
a
problem.
in
that
case,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
responsibility
would
have
to
fall
on
the
juvenile's
lawyer,
who
after
all,
is
the
lawyer
for
the
juvenile,
not
for
the
parents.
i
mean,
if
the
lawyer
sees
a
conflict
of
interest
between
juvenile
and
the
parent,
he's
got
to
go
with
the
juvenile.
now,
if
he
is
retained
counsel
and
being
paid
by
the
parents
to
defend
the
child,
there
can
be
problems.
on
the
other
hand
in
that
case,
if
they're
paying
the
lawyer
to
defend
the
child,
they
probably
want
the
child
to
be
defended
and
therefore
there
wouldn't
be
the
conflict.
the
conflict
could
arise
in
the
case
of
appointed
counsel.
i
could
see
where
the
parents
would
come
in
and
say
“we
don't
want
this
child.
he
given
us
a
hard
time
and
so
forth.”
then
i
think
that
it's
responsibility
of
an
american
lawyer
and
he's
had
a
lot
of
responsibilities
for
long,
long
time
and
i
think
he
can
successfully
fill
that
one.
mr.
william
g.
line
oh,
he
might
have
to
take
on
some
guardian
ad
litem
functions,
but
again
i
think
that
the
average
lawyer
views
his
responsibility
differently
in
dealing
with
a
juvenile.
i
think
there
is
built
in
a
vested
adversarial
feature
about
it.
i
think
that
the
average
lawyer
wants
to
do
something
for
the
child
and
doesn't
view
in
a
hard
core
adversary
fashion
like
you
have
to
some
adults.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
don't
even
know
that
at
least
in
our
area
that
the
adult
criminal
process
is
so
intensely
adversary.
as
i
said,
we
dispose
of
them
by
pleas
of
guilty
and
so
forth.
on
this
business
of
court's
convenience
and
court
administration,
if
the
lawyers
of
nebraska
stop
pleading
people
guilty,
the
system
would
seize
function
without
many
more
judges,
many
more
court
houses
and
many
more
juries.
the
criminal
justice
system
in
this
country
today,
of
course,
functions
on
negotiation
and
i
can't
see
any
real
marked
differences
between
the
adult
criminals
system
and
the
juvenile
system
because
the
end
result
can
be
very
much
the
same.
to
clear
up
any
misunderstanding
on
a
transfer
statute,
i
mentioned
the
transfer
statute
as
to
me
an
example,
the
ultimate
example
of
the
end
result
of
the
process.
i
would
feel
that
debacker
was
just
as
much
deprived
of
its
freedom,
and
would
be
just
as
much
in
a
penal
institution
if
he
were
in
the
training
school
at
carnegie.
i
don't'
think
that
that's
--
i
think
this
court
said
that
in
gault
that
the
no
matter
how
euphemistically
the
title,
the
training
school
is
a
penal
institution.
so,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
substantial
difference.
it's
just
that
on
the
basis
of
a
hearing
with
no
statutory
standard
at
the
pleasure
of
board
of
pardons.
the
end
result
of
the
juvenile
court
process
can
be
after
an
adjudication
of
delinquency
can
be
confinement
in
a
penal
institution,
whether
it'd
be
call
the
morris
training
school
or
the
man's
reformatory.
i
think,
it's
basically
a
distinction
without
a
difference,
but
as
i
say
here
is
a
boy
in
an
adult
penal
institution
with
people
who
got
there
with
constitutional
rights.
mr.
william
g.
line
i
don't
--
adults
will
do
fine.
i
mean,
if
--
from
my
stand
point,
if
wanted
a
--
i
had
to
anticipated
a
--
if
i
got
a
jury
in
this
case
of
adults,
i
don't
believe
that
a
juvenile
is
entitled
a
teenage
jury.
and
again,
i
think,
i
think
that's
a
decision
that
the
lawyer
makes,
one
of
the
first
things
that
you
do
when
you
--
are
defending
an
adult.
if
you
think
do
you
hear
the
facts,
you
investigate
the
case,
will
a
jury
give
him
a
run
for
his
money.
you
may
not
feel
quite
that
way
about
a
juvenile
because
you
might
feel
of
his
need
for
treatment
and
as
his
guardian
ad
litem
you
might
be
a
little
more
inclined
to
involve
of
yourself
in
the
process.
i
mean,
if
an
adult
criminal
defendant
says
“i
want
a
jury”,
why,
he
has
one.
you
don't
want
to
attempt
to
talk
to
him
out
of
it,
because
every
time
you
plead
the
man
guilty,
you're
running
a
risk
of
an
accusation
and
confidence
when
he
gets
incarcerated
and
things
don't
took
go
well.
so,
but
that's
a
routine
part
of
the
perils
of
the
profession
and
it
is
compensated
by
its
advantages.
so
no
a
jury
of
his
peers
i
submit
would
be
satisfied
by
jury
of
adults.
mr.
william
g.
line
no,
i
did
not
raise
that
in
a
juvenile
court
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
g.
line
on
the
statute,
right.
i
--
he
didn't
--
he
never
articulated
a
standard
and
--
mr.
william
g.
line
he
didn't
say.
mr.
william
g.
line
no,
on
that
ground,
i
didn't.
i
objected
to
the
statute
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
deprivation
of
the
jury
and
standard
of
proof
are
together.
mr.
william
g.
line
no.
i
mean
it's
-
it's
--
mr.
william
g.
line
no
matter
what
the
standard,
that
would
fit
a
reasonable
doubt
standard,
that
evidence
just
doesn't
insufficient.
mr.
william
g.
line
that
was
decided
by
the
supreme
court.
mr.
william
g.
line
well,
in
the
second
case
that
they
talk
about,
the
douchcut
case
mentioned
in
the
amicus
curiae
brief,
there
with
obvious
shades
of
division
still
burning
deeply
and
they
said,
we
won't
get
into
it
again.
under
this
record,
we
will
just
apply
it,
under
this
record
why
the
evidence
was
sufficient
and
then,
they
--
mr.
william
g.
line
even
under
a
reasonable
doubt
standard,
and
i
believe
the
dissenting
justices
in
that
case
dissented
only
basically,
i
did
--
we
even
talking
about
it
again
and
then
in
the
second
case,
geiger
case,
it
was
a
rerun
of
a
debacker
case
and
the
lines
formed
up
again
with
the
three
to
four
division.
mr.
william
g.
line
could
he
have
waived
the
right
to
be
represented
by
a
lawyer?
mr.
william
g.
line
ah
--
mr.
william
g.
line
i
think
there
you're
getting
into
extremely
touchy
grounds.
i
suppose
that
in
extremely
intelligent,
they're
no.
the
intelligent
juvenile
could
waive
a
lawyer.
mr.
william
g.
line
well
it,
that
opens
up
a
pandora's
box,
ah
--
mr.
william
g.
line
[laughter
attempt]
i
think
mr.
justice
black
that
from
the
practical
standard,
even
the
prosecutors
today,
are
not
trying
to
get
juveniles
to
waive
the
right
to
a
lawyer.
mr.
william
g.
line
it
could
come
up.
i'm
not
prepared
to
tell
this
court
that
a
16-year-old
that
can
under
no
circumstances
make
an
intelligent
waived
for
a
counsel.
it
could
cause
some
thorny
problems
later.
mr.
william
g.
line
i
doubt
he
would
be
permitted
by
our
courts
--
our
court
of
general
jurisdiction,
knowing
him
personally
is
being
is
when
permitted,
i
don't
believe.
that
would
be
his
kind
of
own
ad
hoc
determination
in
that
case,
but
i
don't
will
he
will
permit
a
juvenile
to
waive
counsel
in
such
a
serious
matter.
mr.
william
g.
line
a
representative
sample
of
the
adult
community
as
the
typical
nebraska
jury
is.
mr.
william
g.
line
that
is
correct.
it's
still
however
it
seems
to
me
the
peer
--
i'm
sorry
to
confess
that
in
the
study
a
lot
of
practicable,
i
never
attempted
to
define
it
before.
mr.
william
g.
line
well
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
tell
him
to
forget
it.
it
would
be
my
initial
reaction
to
[laughter
attempt].
mr.
william
g.
line
i
can
and
i
would
be
--
i
guess,
i
would
brace
myself
for
the
consequences.
the
--
a
couple
of
other
points
there
was
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
questioned
whether
a
boy
could
be
committed
for
two
years
right
before
his
21st
birthday,
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
would
be
no.
i
believe
our
statute
would
be
construed
that
there's
a
total
loss
of
jurisdiction
over
a
juvenile
when
he
becomes
21.
one
thing
that
should
be
made
clear,
under
the
nebraska
juvenile
court
act
there
is
no
statutory
requirement
that
the
proceedings
be
closed
now
to
the
public.
and
there
is
no
protection
against
publicity
of
the
juvenile
court
proceedings
other
than
the
newspapers,
since
the
public
responsibility,
it
is
the
psychiatric
reports,
medical
reports,
probation
officer
reports
are
closed.
but
if
it
could
happen
that
a
juvenile
proceeding
could
get
as
much
publicity
for
all
practical
purpose
as
an
adult
criminal.
mr.
william
g.
line
are
you
asking
me
mr.
justice
brennan
whether
the
nebraska
supreme
court
might
change
its
mind
or
--
mr.
william
g.
line
well
possibly,
a
--
mr.
william
g.
line
yes.
mr.
william
g.
line
depending
on
how
you
said
it.
perhaps,
a
fifth
judge
in
nebraska
supreme
court
might
--
mr.
william
g.
line
--
change
his
mind.
but
really
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
don't
think
--
yesterday,
that
retroactivity
was
going
to
--
i
don't
think
retroactivity
is
--
mr.
william
g.
line
well
--
mr.
william
g.
line
yes.
well,
it
would
depend
on
how
you
said
it
and
what
hints
the
nebraska
supreme
court
might
get
from
the
opinion,
but
since
you
are
familiar
whether
the
argument,
it
just
seems
to
me
that
that
you're
not
going
to
say
until
this
case,
whether
a
juvenile
court
case
is
is
in
fact
a
criminal
prosecution,
and
that
that
--
mr.
william
g.
line
well,
that
is
correct.
to
me,
the
distinction
is
that
there,
you're
talking
about
criminal
cases
have
always
been
criminal
cases.
the
unique
feature
of
this
case
--
mr.
william
g.
line
that's
my
--
that's
my
basic
argument.
mr.
william
g.
line
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
g.
line
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
question
of
whether
equal
justice
under
law
means
for
adults
only.
clarence
debacker
is
in
the
nebraska
state
reformatory
as
the
result
of
a
petition
files
against
him
in
the
juvenile
court
of
dodge
county,
nebraska
alleging
his
delinquency
because
of
the
uttering
of
a
possession
of
a
forged
check
within
intent
to
utter
as
genuine.
a
jury
trial
was
demanded
and
denied
because
a
nebraska
juvenile
court
act
says
that
juvenile
delinquency
cases
will
be
handled
without
a
jury
and
a
quantum
of
proof
is
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
habeas
corpus
was
sought
in
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
it
was
denied
and
the
nebraska
supreme
court
in
a
4-3
decision,
it
was
a
type
of
decision
where
the
minority
prevailed,
held
that
the
nebraska
juvenile
court
act
met
federal
constitutional
requirements.
nebraska
has
a
state
constitutional
provision
requiring
a
concurrence
of
five
judges
to
declare
a
state
statute
invalid.
the
position
of
the
appellant
in
this
case
has
been
referred
to
by
some
of
the
adversaries
and
amicus
curiaes
as
being
simplistic
and,
without
the
evil
connotations
of
the
word,
it
is
precisely
that.
since
this
court’s
decision
in
duncan,
in
bloom,
in
gault,
a
proceeding
where
a
person
can
wind
up
in
a
penal
institution
for
more
than
six
months
surely
has
all
the
attributes
of
a
serious
felony
case.
mr.
william
g.
line
he
was
tried
in
april
of--
actually,
february
or
march
1968
before
duncan
and
bloom
were
decided.
mr.
william
g.
line
i
don’t
think
they’re
even
relevant
on
the
retroactivity.
i
realize
that
they’re
not
retroactive.
mr.
william
g.
line
they
were--
mr.
william
g.
line
right.
mr.
william
g.
line
may
20,
1968.
this
case
was
orally
argued
in
the
nebraska
supreme
court
on
may
29,
1968.
mr.
william
g.
line
right.
mr.
justice
white,
the
position--
mr.
william
g.
line
well,
gault
left
open
the
question
of
whether
there
was--
a
juvenile
delinquency
case
was
in
fact
a
criminal
case.
mr.
william
g.
line
well,
they
wouldn’t
at
the
time
of
gault,
but--
mr.
william
g.
line
my
argument
is
based
on
this
premise.
that--
mr.
william
g.
line
you
have
to
rely
on
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
william
g.
line
and
on
the
equal
protection
clause--
mr.
william
g.
line
well--
mr.
william
g.
line
for
example,
an
adult
in
nebraska
due
to
nebraska
constitutional
procedures,
the
statutory
decisions,
you
get
two
jury
trials
for
running
a
stop
sign,
six-man
jury
in
the
lower
court,
the
12
men
jury
on
appeal
to
the
district
court.
so,
that
argument
also
we
do
rely
on
of
course.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
new
case
basically,
and
until
this
court
decides
this
question,
this
is
the
case
that
will--
should
decide
once
and
for
all
whether
these
labels
that
everyone
is
so
fund
of
are--
mean
anything
anymore.
what
this
case
is
not
about
of
course
is
the
rehabilitative
features
of
the
juvenile
court.
no
one
has
pointed
out,
in
my
opinion,
any
reason
why
a
jury
trial
or
an
adjudication
based
upon
a
criminal
standard
of
proof
will
interfere
one
with
the
ennoble
benevolent
features
of
the
juvenile
court
system.
for
example,
i
can
imagine
a
juvenile
court
judge
who
has
a
delinquent
before
him
being
able
to
be
much
more
parens
patriae
if
he
hasn’t
convicted
him.
surely,
he
can
say
“you
have
been
convicted
by
a
jury
of
your
peers.
now,
let’s
see
what
we
can
do
about
you,”
and
the
juvenile
is
up
to
feel
less
resentment
at
the
juvenile
court
process
if
he
has
been
convicted
by
his
fellow
citizens
with
a
standard
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
william
g.
line
that,
i
think,
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
the
magic
of
the
whole
system.
mr.
william
g.
line
is
the
magic
of
the
whole
system.
i
think
that’s
the
reason
he
ought
to
have
it.
very
occasionally,
judges
think
people
should
be
convicted
and
juries
think
they
shouldn’t,
and
that’s
the
way
it
works
out.
mr.
william
g.
line
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
juvenile
court
system
means
anything
at
all,
the
theory,
as
i
understand
it,
is
you’re
not
suppose
to
punish
him.
you’re
supposed
to
rehabilitate
him.
of
course,
i
think
modern
penology
is
supposed
to
be
arriving
at
that
theory
too.
we--
the
thumb
screw
and
the
right
and
so
forth,
we
understood
it
in
rehabilitation.
it
seems
to
me
that
it--
the
juvenile
court
can
still
function.
that
merely
because
you
give
a
boy
a
constitutional
right
to
be
tried
by
a
jury,
that
you
don’t
then
necessarily
have
to
take
away
from
him
whatever
benefits
he
had
remained.
mr.
william
g.
line
i--
mr.
william
g.
line
no
question
about
it.
that
was
the--
mr.
william
g.
line
it
can
be,
but
i
submit
not
near
as
traumatic
as
winding
up
in
a
penal
institution
on
the
say
so
of
one
man
when
you
have
asked
for
a
jury
trial
and
on
the
basis
of
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
i
think
that
is
so
much
more
traumatic
than
a--
mr.
william
g.
line
that
is
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
the
argument
to
that
effect
is
made
earnestly,
but
i
don’t
believe
realistically,
mr.
chief
justice,
90%
or
more
criminal
cases
throughout
this
country
are
disposed
of
on
pleas
of
guilty.
juvenile
cases--
the
argument
is
made
in
the
amicus
curiae
briefs.
one
reason
that
this
court
shouldn’t
grant
a
jury
trial
is
because
it
has
been
considered
so
invaluable
it’s
never
been
demanded.
i
think
a
reference
is
made
at
denver
where
there
were
only
very
few
requests
made
over
period
of
years.
and
then
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
they
say,
“on
the
other
hand,
if
you
do
make
it
available
nationwide
then
it
will
be
in
such
demand
that
the
system
will
breakdown.
we
won’t
be
able
to
administrate.
we
won’t
be
able
to
do
this
and
we
won’t
be
able
to
do
that,
and--
mr.
william
g.
line
that
is
true
and,
again,
if
the--
surely,
the
availability
of
jury
trial
cannot
depend
upon
the
administrative
convenience
of
a
court
or--
mr.
william
g.
line
mr.
chief
justice,
you’ve
run
a
ringer
on
me--
in
on
me
on
bail
because
that
is
not
an
issue
that
i
am--
that
i
have
addressed
myself
to.
mr.
william
g.
line
and,
that
is
not
presented
by
this
case.
mr.
william
g.
line
it’s
part
of
the
whole
problem
but
then,
right
there,
i
think
you
get
into
a
whole
new
issue.
it’s--
probably,
people
are
acutely
aware
of
it
now
because
i
read
in
the
paper
after
i
got
here
about
the
juvenile
crime
involving
dropping
a
rock
over--
off
an
overpass
where
he’d
been
out
on
bail.
and
so,
that
becomes
fresh
in
a
person’s
mind
but,
again,
bail
is
something
that
shouldn’t
perhaps
be
just
automatic.
certainly,
society
can
protect
itself
from
people
who
are
psychiatrically
disturbed.
if
they
think
there’s
going
to
be
a
high
risk
of
danger
to
society,
we--
the
system
should
be
able
to
take
care
of
that.
the
fact
that
there
are
problems
and
that
perhaps
if
this
court
decides
that
a
juvenile
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial,
the
fact
that
perhaps
it
might
be
used
as
a
decision
to
later
decision
that
bail
rights
should
be
enlarged
i
think
is,
i
respectfully
suggest,
one
step
at
a
time.
here,
i
think
the
realities
of
the
situation
are--
duncan
said
the
purpose
of
the
jury
trial
is
to
provide
protection
against
an
arbitrary
persecutor
or
a
biased
judge.
most
attorneys,
i
think,
are
willing
to
wave
jury
trial
for
juvenile.
you’re
not
going
to,
as
his
counsel,
you’re
not
going
to
put
him
through
this
traumatic
experience
unless
you
think
that
it’s
in
his
best
interest.
i
wanted
to
put
debacker
through
the
traumatic
experience
because
i
was
satisfied--
it
was
my
judgment
that
he
would
be
acquitted,
although
he
was
typically--
mr.
william
g.
line
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
line
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
g.
line
that
was
going
into
the
dispositional
stage,
mr.
justice
stewart.
it
was
not
referred
to
before
the
juvenile
court
judge
made
his
adjudication,
and
our
statute
statutorily
declares
a
person
delinquent
if
he
violates
a
statute
of
the
state
or
a
municipal
ordinance.
i
mean,
it’s--
debacker
was
declared
a
delinquent
because
he
violated
the
forged
check
statute.
then,
after
that,
the
judge
did
go
into
his
background,
prior
offenses,
prior
troubles
with
the
law
in
deciding
apparently
to
commit
him
summarily
to
the
boy’s
training
school,
but
it
was
not
an
issue
and
the
proceeding
was
not
founded
on
the
basis
that
he
was
delinquent
generally.
he
was
delinquent
because
of
a
forged
check.
mr.
william
g.
line
no,
they--
there’s
a
special
supervision
portion
of
the
statute
and--
your
honor,
no.
it
has
to
be--
he
has
to
be--
violated
any
law
of
a
state
of
any
city
or
a
village
ordinance.
if
he’s
hopeless,
homeless,
or
destitute,
he’s
under
section
43201.
he
is
a
dependent
child.
he’s
a--
mr.
william
g.
line
yes.
mr.
william
g.
line
yes,
subdivision
4,
delinquent
child
shall
mean
any
child
under
the
age
of
18
years
who
has
violated
any
law
of
the
state
or
any
city
or
village
ordinance.
section
5,
yes,
a
child
in
need
of
special
supervision
shall
mean
a
child
who
is
under
the
age
of
18
years
and
is
wayward,
habitually
truant,
deports
himself
so
as
to
endanger
his
morals
or
the
morals
of
others.
mr.
william
g.
line
i
believe
that
he
could
if--
but
not
as
a
delinquent.
mr.
william
g.
line
that’s
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
g.
line
i
think
there
is
a
difference.
a
child
in
need
of
special
supervision,
seems
to
me,
to
be
a
child
in
a
status
more
than--
a
delinquent
child
is
a
child
who,
by
his
voluntary
volitional
conduct,
has
violated
the
law
of
a
state.
i
think
that
it
wouldn’t
necessarily
apply
to
a
child
in
need
of
special
supervision.
for
example,
if
a
child
is
found
on
a
doorstep
and
becomes
a
ward
of
the
juvenile
court,
i
mean,
the
child
doesn’t
need
a
jury
trial
to
determine
whether
or
not
somebody
will
look
after
him.
mr.
william
g.
line
alright.
mr.
william
g.
line
i
think
so.
i
have
some
difficulty
with
this
concept
of
how
you
determine
in
advance
how
serious
a
case
is
going
to
be,
as
to
whether
the
jury
trial
is
going
to
be
available.
what--
i
think
if
you--
if
it’s
contemplated
in
the
process
with
this
child
that
he’s
going
to
be
confined
for
more
than
six
months,
then
he
ought
to
have
a
jury
trial.
mr.
william
g.
line
well,
who’d
make
the
decision
in--
you
say
in
the
gray
area?
mr.
william
g.
line
well--
mr.
william
g.
line
well,
first
of
all,
it
would
be--
i
think
it
would
require
demand
of
the
juvenile’s
counsel.
second,
i
suppose
then
it
requires
the
judge
to
search
his
mind
and
determine
what
he’s
going
to
do
with
the
child
and
there,
frankly,
i
have
difficulty.
the
frank
case
that
referred
to
probation
being
impossible
for
over
six
months
without
a
jury
trial
and
then
if
the
probation
is
violated
only
a
sentence
of
six
months
could
be
imposed.
it’s--
i
don’t
know
how
a
judge
can
determine
a
case--
what
he’s
going
to
do
with
the
person
before
him
until
he
knows
what
the
facts
of
the
case
are
but,
apparently,
it
can
be
done.
mr.
william
g.
line
well,
i
think
that
is
perhaps
more
the
consideration
but,
certainly,
a
juvenile
court
judge
is
no
particular
expert
in
deciding
whether
or
not
debacker
forged
the
check
or
broke
into
a
filling
station.
that,
i
think,
is
still
within
the
traditional
competence
of
the
jury.
mr.
william
g.
line
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
a
few
comments
would
be
in
order
on
the
point
if
i'm
not
making
a
direct
appeal
from
the
juvenile
court,
and
it's
been
pointed
out
that
i
did
not
attack
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
of
course
the
reason
that
is
obvious.
the
evidence
is
more
insufficient
to
sustain
conviction
of
what
he
did
and
appeal
on
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
would
have
been
close
to
frivolous.
the
jury
question
was
another
matter.
when
this
boy's
mother
told
him
to
sign
his
father's
name
to
the
check
and
that
would
have
been
established
in
front
of
a
jury
of
citizens
in
the
community,
i
believe
that
they
would
have
exercise
the
pardoning
power
that
jurors
want
to
exercise.
mr.
william
g.
line
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
obvious
that
there
would
be
situations
where
the
--
that
the
child
is
adversary
to
the
parent
and
it
existed
in
the
case.
the
child
is
adversary
to
the
father.
mr.
william
g.
line
i
think
in
--
certainly.
i
don't
know
what
the
percentage
would
be,
but
it
could
--
if
it's
as
highest
as
25
or
30%
of
the
cases,
it's
substantial
percentage
and
would
present
a
problem.
in
that
case,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
responsibility
would
have
to
fall
on
the
juvenile's
lawyer,
who
after
all,
is
the
lawyer
for
the
juvenile,
not
for
the
parents.
i
mean,
if
the
lawyer
sees
a
conflict
of
interest
between
juvenile
and
the
parent,
he's
got
to
go
with
the
juvenile.
now,
if
he
is
retained
counsel
and
being
paid
by
the
parents
to
defend
the
child,
there
can
be
problems.
on
the
other
hand
in
that
case,
if
they're
paying
the
lawyer
to
defend
the
child,
they
probably
want
the
child
to
be
defended
and
therefore
there
wouldn't
be
the
conflict.
the
conflict
could
arise
in
the
case
of
appointed
counsel.
i
could
see
where
the
parents
would
come
in
and
say
“we
don't
want
this
child.
he
given
us
a
hard
time
and
so
forth.”
then
i
think
that
it's
responsibility
of
an
american
lawyer
and
he's
had
a
lot
of
responsibilities
for
long,
long
time
and
i
think
he
can
successfully
fill
that
one.
mr.
william
g.
line
oh,
he
might
have
to
take
on
some
guardian
ad
litem
functions,
but
again
i
think
that
the
average
lawyer
views
his
responsibility
differently
in
dealing
with
a
juvenile.
i
think
there
is
built
in
a
vested
adversarial
feature
about
it.
i
think
that
the
average
lawyer
wants
to
do
something
for
the
child
and
doesn't
view
in
a
hard
core
adversary
fashion
like
you
have
to
some
adults.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
don't
even
know
that
at
least
in
our
area
that
the
adult
criminal
process
is
so
intensely
adversary.
as
i
said,
we
dispose
of
them
by
pleas
of
guilty
and
so
forth.
on
this
business
of
court's
convenience
and
court
administration,
if
the
lawyers
of
nebraska
stop
pleading
people
guilty,
the
system
would
seize
function
without
many
more
judges,
many
more
court
houses
and
many
more
juries.
the
criminal
justice
system
in
this
country
today,
of
course,
functions
on
negotiation
and
i
can't
see
any
real
marked
differences
between
the
adult
criminals
system
and
the
juvenile
system
because
the
end
result
can
be
very
much
the
same.
to
clear
up
any
misunderstanding
on
a
transfer
statute,
i
mentioned
the
transfer
statute
as
to
me
an
example,
the
ultimate
example
of
the
end
result
of
the
process.
i
would
feel
that
debacker
was
just
as
much
deprived
of
its
freedom,
and
would
be
just
as
much
in
a
penal
institution
if
he
were
in
the
training
school
at
carnegie.
i
don't'
think
that
that's
--
i
think
this
court
said
that
in
gault
that
the
no
matter
how
euphemistically
the
title,
the
training
school
is
a
penal
institution.
so,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
substantial
difference.
it's
just
that
on
the
basis
of
a
hearing
with
no
statutory
standard
at
the
pleasure
of
board
of
pardons.
the
end
result
of
the
juvenile
court
process
can
be
after
an
adjudication
of
delinquency
can
be
confinement
in
a
penal
institution,
whether
it'd
be
call
the
morris
training
school
or
the
man's
reformatory.
i
think,
it's
basically
a
distinction
without
a
difference,
but
as
i
say
here
is
a
boy
in
an
adult
penal
institution
with
people
who
got
there
with
constitutional
rights.
mr.
william
g.
line
i
don't
--
adults
will
do
fine.
i
mean,
if
--
from
my
stand
point,
if
wanted
a
--
i
had
to
anticipated
a
--
if
i
got
a
jury
in
this
case
of
adults,
i
don't
believe
that
a
juvenile
is
entitled
a
teenage
jury.
and
again,
i
think,
i
think
that's
a
decision
that
the
lawyer
makes,
one
of
the
first
things
that
you
do
when
you
--
are
defending
an
adult.
if
you
think
do
you
hear
the
facts,
you
investigate
the
case,
will
a
jury
give
him
a
run
for
his
money.
you
may
not
feel
quite
that
way
about
a
juvenile
because
you
might
feel
of
his
need
for
treatment
and
as
his
guardian
ad
litem
you
might
be
a
little
more
inclined
to
involve
of
yourself
in
the
process.
i
mean,
if
an
adult
criminal
defendant
says
“i
want
a
jury”,
why,
he
has
one.
you
don't
want
to
attempt
to
talk
to
him
out
of
it,
because
every
time
you
plead
the
man
guilty,
you're
running
a
risk
of
an
accusation
and
confidence
when
he
gets
incarcerated
and
things
don't
took
go
well.
so,
but
that's
a
routine
part
of
the
perils
of
the
profession
and
it
is
compensated
by
its
advantages.
so
no
a
jury
of
his
peers
i
submit
would
be
satisfied
by
jury
of
adults.
mr.
william
g.
line
no,
i
did
not
raise
that
in
a
juvenile
court
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
g.
line
on
the
statute,
right.
i
--
he
didn't
--
he
never
articulated
a
standard
and
--
mr.
william
g.
line
he
didn't
say.
mr.
william
g.
line
no,
on
that
ground,
i
didn't.
i
objected
to
the
statute
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
deprivation
of
the
jury
and
standard
of
proof
are
together.
mr.
william
g.
line
no.
i
mean
it's
-
it's
--
mr.
william
g.
line
no
matter
what
the
standard,
that
would
fit
a
reasonable
doubt
standard,
that
evidence
just
doesn't
insufficient.
mr.
william
g.
line
that
was
decided
by
the
supreme
court.
mr.
william
g.
line
well,
in
the
second
case
that
they
talk
about,
the
douchcut
case
mentioned
in
the
amicus
curiae
brief,
there
with
obvious
shades
of
division
still
burning
deeply
and
they
said,
we
won't
get
into
it
again.
under
this
record,
we
will
just
apply
it,
under
this
record
why
the
evidence
was
sufficient
and
then,
they
--
mr.
william
g.
line
even
under
a
reasonable
doubt
standard,
and
i
believe
the
dissenting
justices
in
that
case
dissented
only
basically,
i
did
--
we
even
talking
about
it
again
and
then
in
the
second
case,
geiger
case,
it
was
a
rerun
of
a
debacker
case
and
the
lines
formed
up
again
with
the
three
to
four
division.
mr.
william
g.
line
could
he
have
waived
the
right
to
be
represented
by
a
lawyer?
mr.
william
g.
line
ah
--
mr.
william
g.
line
i
think
there
you're
getting
into
extremely
touchy
grounds.
i
suppose
that
in
extremely
intelligent,
they're
no.
the
intelligent
juvenile
could
waive
a
lawyer.
mr.
william
g.
line
well
it,
that
opens
up
a
pandora's
box,
ah
--
mr.
william
g.
line
[laughter
attempt]
i
think
mr.
justice
black
that
from
the
practical
standard,
even
the
prosecutors
today,
are
not
trying
to
get
juveniles
to
waive
the
right
to
a
lawyer.
mr.
william
g.
line
it
could
come
up.
i'm
not
prepared
to
tell
this
court
that
a
16-year-old
that
can
under
no
circumstances
make
an
intelligent
waived
for
a
counsel.
it
could
cause
some
thorny
problems
later.
mr.
william
g.
line
i
doubt
he
would
be
permitted
by
our
courts
--
our
court
of
general
jurisdiction,
knowing
him
personally
is
being
is
when
permitted,
i
don't
believe.
that
would
be
his
kind
of
own
ad
hoc
determination
in
that
case,
but
i
don't
will
he
will
permit
a
juvenile
to
waive
counsel
in
such
a
serious
matter.
mr.
william
g.
line
a
representative
sample
of
the
adult
community
as
the
typical
nebraska
jury
is.
mr.
william
g.
line
that
is
correct.
it's
still
however
it
seems
to
me
the
peer
--
i'm
sorry
to
confess
that
in
the
study
a
lot
of
practicable,
i
never
attempted
to
define
it
before.
mr.
william
g.
line
well
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
tell
him
to
forget
it.
it
would
be
my
initial
reaction
to
[laughter
attempt].
mr.
william
g.
line
i
can
and
i
would
be
--
i
guess,
i
would
brace
myself
for
the
consequences.
the
--
a
couple
of
other
points
there
was
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
questioned
whether
a
boy
could
be
committed
for
two
years
right
before
his
21st
birthday,
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
would
be
no.
i
believe
our
statute
would
be
construed
that
there's
a
total
loss
of
jurisdiction
over
a
juvenile
when
he
becomes
21.
one
thing
that
should
be
made
clear,
under
the
nebraska
juvenile
court
act
there
is
no
statutory
requirement
that
the
proceedings
be
closed
now
to
the
public.
and
there
is
no
protection
against
publicity
of
the
juvenile
court
proceedings
other
than
the
newspapers,
since
the
public
responsibility,
it
is
the
psychiatric
reports,
medical
reports,
probation
officer
reports
are
closed.
but
if
it
could
happen
that
a
juvenile
proceeding
could
get
as
much
publicity
for
all
practical
purpose
as
an
adult
criminal.
mr.
william
g.
line
are
you
asking
me
mr.
justice
brennan
whether
the
nebraska
supreme
court
might
change
its
mind
or
--
mr.
william
g.
line
well
possibly,
a
--
mr.
william
g.
line
yes.
mr.
william
g.
line
depending
on
how
you
said
it.
perhaps,
a
fifth
judge
in
nebraska
supreme
court
might
--
mr.
william
g.
line
--
change
his
mind.
but
really
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
don't
think
--
yesterday,
that
retroactivity
was
going
to
--
i
don't
think
retroactivity
is
--
mr.
william
g.
line
well
--
mr.
william
g.
line
yes.
well,
it
would
depend
on
how
you
said
it
and
what
hints
the
nebraska
supreme
court
might
get
from
the
opinion,
but
since
you
are
familiar
whether
the
argument,
it
just
seems
to
me
that
that
you're
not
going
to
say
until
this
case,
whether
a
juvenile
court
case
is
is
in
fact
a
criminal
prosecution,
and
that
that
--
mr.
william
g.
line
well,
that
is
correct.
to
me,
the
distinction
is
that
there,
you're
talking
about
criminal
cases
have
always
been
criminal
cases.
the
unique
feature
of
this
case
--
mr.
william
g.
line
that's
my
--
that's
my
basic
argument.
