mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
if
the
court
please,
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
reference
to
the
young
lad
debacker
being
in
the
state
reformatory,
that
he
is
there
under
a
transfer
statute
which
is
not
involve
with
deciding
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
jury
in
juvenile
cases.
this
is
a
transfer
statute
where
the
young
man
is
transferred
after
a
hearing
at
corny,
and
i
maintain
that
the
method
to
attack
this
is
to
bring
a
habeas
corpus
at
the
penal
complex
to
decide
whether
this
transfer
statute
is
unconstitutional.
this
is
a
separate
matter
that
should
be
determined.
the
only
thing
here
is
whether
or
not
the
trial
of
the
young
man
in
county
court
or
in
the
juvenile
court
need
be
with
a
jury,
and
the
fact
that
he
was
eventually
transferred
to
the
men’s
reformatory
doesn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
this
jury
question.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
no,
there
hasn’t.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
i
maintain
that
this--
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
this
is
the
way
to
attack
it
rather
than
to
say
that
the
statute
which
says
that
the
juvenile
is
not
entitled
to
a
jury
should
be
attacked.
the
attack
should
be
against
the
statute
that
allows
the
transfer
rather
than
the
statute
on
the
jury.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
he
is.
the
nebraska
juvenile
code
is
oriented
along
judicial
lines
rather
than
along
social
welfare
lines.
we
have
included
in
the
nebraska
statute
the
notice,
which
has
always
been
there
for
years
even
prior
to
gault,
of
the
right
to
counsel,
of
the
right
to
confrontation,
the
right
to
self-in--
against
self-incrimination,
the
right
to
cross-examination,
the
right
to
a
transcript
of
the
proceedings,
the
right
to
appellate
review.
all
of
these
things
have
always
been
a
part
of
nebraska’s
juvenile
court
law,
and
this
is
the
matter
of
the
determination
of
due
process.
the
fact
that
the
youngsters
have
always
had
this
that
this
is
oriented
along
judicial
lines
rather
than
along
social
welfare
lines.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
if
the
court
please
the
appellant
yesterday
mentioned
that
you
would
accept
the
measure
of
involuntary
custody.
it's
a
matter
of
determination
is
to
whether
or
not
the
jury
trial
guarantee
in
a
criminal
case
applies
to
juvenile
court
proceedings.
of
course,
we
have
that
in
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
--
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
he
is
in
the
men's
reformatory
which
is
a
part
of
the
penal
complex.
he
is
no
longer
in
the
training
school
to
which
he
was
ordered
by
the
court.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
record
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
no.
this
occurs
as
a
matter
of
transfer
by
the
department
of
institutions
through
a
statute.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes.
the
basis
for
the
transfer
is
a
matter
of
the
statute
sets
out
if
they
become
incorrigible
they
can
be
transferred
and
it
was
based
on
this
that
he
was
transferred.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
by
habeas
corpus,
then
at
the
penal
complex
now
to
test
the
sufficiency
or
the
constitutionality
of
this
transfer
rather
than
through
the
juvenile
jury
system.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
there
is
a
hearing
before
the
--
within
the
board
of
pardons
and
the
--
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
department
of
public
institution,
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
there
is
a
hearing
that
determines
this.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
held
--
i'm
not
certain
just
where
they
hold
it.
i
would
assume,
i'm
not
familiar
with
this
part,
but
i
would
assume
that
they
hold
it
at
the
training
school
at
carnegie
where
the
boy
is.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
that
i
don't
know
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
no.
no,
i
wouldn't
call
that
a
hearing.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
i'm
not
familiar
with
this
part
of
the
of
it
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
the
--
yes
sir.
basically,
yes
your
honor.
the
commitment
is
for
an
indeterminant
period
of
time.
there
is
never
a
time
stated
in
the
order.
they
are
committed
to
the
institution
and
whenever
the
institution
feels
that
they
are
ready
for
release,
they
will
release
them.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
the
longest
period
of
time
that
they
can
be
kept
is
until
they
are
21.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
the
amount
of
time
is
limited
to
two
years
by
the
statute.
they
can
only
commit
them
for
a
term
of
two
years
to
the
penal
complex
under
this
administrative
custody.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
i'm
not
certain
your
honor.
i
would
believe
that
they
could,
but
i
couldn't
be
certain.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
right.
this
is
my
contention
that
this
is
another
matter
which
should
be
taken
up.
but
on
the
other
side
of
this
is
a
matter
of
the
benefits
which
a
child
receives
from
a
judicially
oriented
juvenile
court
system.
this
against
the
involuntary
custody
idea
in
the
training
school,
not
in
the
penal
complex.
there
was
some
mentioned
yesterday
of
the
delinquency
of
being
a
violation
of
statute.
this
is
the
definition
that
the
nebraska
statutes
have
of
being
a
delinquent,
any
one
who
violates
any
of
the
state
statutes
or
municipal
ordinances,
but
it's
more
than
just
a
violation
that
is
involved
that
can
involve
involuntary
custody.
the
child
in
need
of
special
supervision
can
be
disposed
of
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
a
child
who
is
being
charged
of
being
a
delinquent
child
which
involves
the
commitment
to
the
training
school
or
to
a
foster
home
or
probation
or
any
of
the
other
avenues
open
so
far
as
a
delinquent
child
is
concerned.
i
might
note
in
passing
that
even
after
a
criminal
trial,
the
district
judge
has
the
option
if
he
wishes
to
send
the
boy
to
the
training
school
instead
of
sending
him
to
the
penal
complex.
the
fact
that
he
has
been
convicted
in
district
court
by
a
jury,
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
he
is
going
to
the
penal
complex.
he
could
be
sent
to
the
training
school
if
the
court
felt
that
this
was
a
proper
disposition
of
the
case.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
no.
he
cannot
be
sent
directly
from
the
juvenile
court
to
a
penal
institution.
he
must
--
the
only
place
they
can
commit
him
is
to
a
training
school
or
to
some
foster
home
or
some
other
disposition.
they
cannot
sentence
to
the
penal
complex.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
this
would
be
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
incorrigibility
is
the
one
that
i
can
recall
right
off
hand
as
a
basis
for
the
transfer,
but
actually
and
with
even
neglected
their
dependent
children
if
you're
talking
about
involuntary
custody,
a
neglected
or
dependent
child
can
be
taken
from
his
home
and
placed
in
some
other
home,
be
at
a
state
home
for
children
or
what
it
maybe.
so,
even
with
a
dependent
or
a
neglected
child,
there
can
still
be
a
matter
of
involuntary
custody
so
to
speak
involved.
if
this
can
be
is
the
measure
of
whether
or
not
it
is
a
criminal
matter
guaranteed
a
jury
trial
under
the
sixth
amendment
which
guarantees
a
jury
trial
in
the
criminal
matters.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
in
a
foster
home
or
it
could
be
in
a
state
institution,
a
state
home
for
children
for
this
type
of
thing.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
the
child
in
need
of
special
supervision
can
be
handled
the
same
as
the
delinquent
child.
the
disposition
can
be
the
same.
however,
there
is
one
restriction
that
in
order
for
child
in
need
of
special
supervision
to
be
committed
to
an
institution
in
the
first
instance,
there
must
be
a
showing
that
it
is
for
the
--
that
is
necessary
for
the
protection
of
the
welfare
of
the
child
or
of
society
in
general.
and
this
must
be
specifically
shown
alleged
in
the
petition
which
is
served
and
shown
at
the
hearing
before
they
can
be
committed
in
the
first
instance.
otherwise,
there
must
be
probation
and/or
some
other
type
of
disposition
and
if
after
a
period
of
time,
it's
shown
that
there
is
not
been
the
rehabilitation
that
should
be,
they
can
then
be
brought
back
into
court
and
they
can
be
sent
to
the
training
school.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes.
so
far
as
the
benefits
of
not
having
the
jury
trial
and
juvenile
court
of
concern,
the
two
main
things
are
the
promptness
of
the
disposition
and
avoiding
the
trauma
of
a
public
hearing.
so
far
as
the
prompt
hearing
is
concerned,
the
jury
trial
in
and
of
itself
is
a
delay.
just
simply
setting
up
a
jury
trial
where
in
addition
to
the
people
involved
in
the
thing,
you
must
get
either
six
or
12
other
people
at
a
certain
place
at
a
certain
time.
schedule
--
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
they
do
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
i
believe
there
are
12
jurisdictions
i
believe,
i'm
not
sure
that's
all
states.
the
district
of
columbia
does
have
provision
for
a
jury
trial
in
their
proceedings.
i
might
point
out
that
according
to
judge
miller's
testimony
before
the
senate
that
there
were
approximately
10%
of
the
juveniles
that
asked
for
a
jury
trial
and
this
10%
asking
for
a
jury
trial
has
caused
approximately
a
six-year
backlog
in
these
trials.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes.
this
is
what
--
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
pardon?
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
i
would
assume
that
it
is
because
of
the
other
business
of
the
court
that
they
can
only
schedule
one
per
week.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
one
jury
trial,
yes,
one
jury
trial
per
week.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
there
were
approximately
--
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
i
think
this
is
what
the
judge
--
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
this
is
what
the
judge
was
asking
for.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
pardon?
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
by
increasing
it,
there
were
approximately
2,500
cases
that
were
handled
during
this
year.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes.
this
is
true.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
well,
this
presents
a
problem.
it
was
pointed
out
here
yesterday
that
in
colorado
where
they
allow
jury
trials
that
there
were
only
two
over
a
certain
period
of
time.
however,
i
believe
this
was
prior
to
gault
when
the
attorney
was
injected
into
the
juvenile
court
proceedings.
since
that
time,
there
had
been
more
and
more
juveniles
with
an
attorney.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes.
well,
this
presents
a
problem,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
he
can
get
it
with
by
waiving
a
jury
trial,
by
pleading
--
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
this
brings
up
the
problem
of
how
does
he
waive
it?
how
does
a
youngster
waive
it?
attorneys
are
becoming
more
and
more
hesitant
about
waiving
for
a
youngster
because
of
the
fact
that
he
will
discuss
it
with
the
youngster
and
the
youngster
will
say
later,
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
i
would
say
--
i
would
say
they
should.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
but
can
the
parent
--
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
i
don't
know
that
they
would
be
giving
up
the
benefits
of
a
court
by
asking
for
a
jury
trial.
i
don't
think
that
this
would
necessarily
be
so.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
oh
yes,
he
could.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
the
problem
is
that
the
attorneys
become
hesitant
about
waiving
because
can
a
parent
waive
for
a
child
or
does
the
child
have
to
understand
is
the
child
that
has
--
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
in
our
proceedings
at
least,
they
are.
the
matters
discussed
with
the
parents
and
with
the
child.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
you
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
if
there
are
a
number
of
these,
there
can
be
a
long
delay
during
the
period
when
they
readjusting
for
this.
these
things
can't
happen
immediately.
during
this
period
of
time,
something
has
to
be
done
with
these
youngsters.
they're
at
this
time
they're
in
their
formative
years.
they're
in
the
period
of
time
when
they
are
forming
themselves
for
later
life
and
by
not
correcting
the
thing
immediately
or
as
close
to
the
time
of
the
incident
as
possible,
you're
really
doing
damage
to
the
child
rather
than
helping
him.
you're
hindering
the
child.
you're
burdening
the
child
with
something
that
he
shouldn't
be.
you're
burdening
him
with
the
delay
that
is
really
bad
for
him.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
and
this
my
question
is,
is
this
right?
is
this
fair
to
thrust
this
thing
in?
i'm
not
sure
i
don't
have
any
figures
state
wide
in
the
particular
county
in
which
i
am;
population
approximately
35,000.
i
would
say
that
we
run
30
to
35
juvenile
cases
a
year
in
the
juvenile
court.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes
sir.
we
use
the
--
there,
we
use
the
county
judge
which
--
who
serves
as
probate
judge
and
has
a
--
it
doesn't
have
general
jurisdiction,
but
he
has
charge
of
probate
matters
and
we
use
him
as
the
juvenile
judge.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
in
omaha
in
lincoln,
they
do
have
special
juvenile
courts
and
i'm
not
familiar
the
figures
there.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
this
is
very
true.
there
can
be
a
number
of
things.
the
child
--
the
child's
real
problem
is
to
where
he
is,
maybe
his
parents.
this
may
well
be,
maybe
his
parents
haven't
provided
him
with
the
background
that
he
needs.
this
is
a
reason
that
he's
into
this
difficulty.
this
is
a
reason
that
he
is
going
out
and
stolen
or
this
type
of
thing
and
the
parents
maybe
the
real
problem
in
the
thing
and
having
the
parents
waive
or
speak
for
him
isn't
doing
justice
for
the
child.
so
far
as
the
insistence
of
the
appellant
that
he
could
have
won
the
case
in
a
criminal
court
to
a
jury
there
is
other
evidence
that
i
have
which
is
still
in
the
file
which
had
not
used
in
this
court,
in
the
juvenile
court.
i'm
just
as
convinced
that
i
could've
convicted
in
a
criminal
case,
however,
my
decision
was
that
the
possibilities
for
using
the
juvenile
court
could
possibly
save
this
young
man
and
this
was
the
reason
that
he
was
taken
into
juvenile
court
rather
than
taking
into
the
criminal
court.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
no,
i
have
discretion
on
at
any
age.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
i
would
have
discretion
there
too.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
no,
no.
the
top
age
is
18.
when
they
reach
their
18th
birthday,
they
are
no
longer
subject
to
the
juvenile
court.
then,
they
must
go
directly
into
criminal
court.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes.
so
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned.
by
way
of
background,
we
do
have
the
presumption
that
a
7-year-old
cannot
form
intent
and
that
someone
between
7
and
the
14,
it's
a
rebuttable
presumption
whether
or
not
they
can.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
it
was
touched
upon
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
i
don't
believe
that
court's
opinion
mentioned
it,
but
it
was
simply
touched
upon
and
--
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
the
closest
thing
to
it
is
the
fugate
versus
ronin
case
where
they
say
that
the
prosecutor
has
an
absolute
discretion
in
it
which
is
putting
with
this
--
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
which
is
the
basic
concept
of
the
prosecution
throughout
all
of
the
united
states,
that
prosecutor
has
discretion
as
to
what
he
will
file
or
whether
it
would
be
misdemeanor,
felony
or
whatever
it
maybe.
so
far
as
other
jurisdictions
which
or
other
people
which
feel
that
a
jury
trial
should
not
be
had,
there
are
of
course
34
states
which
do
not
provide
for
a
jury
trial.
of
course
the
district
of
columbia
as
i've
mentioned
before
does
have
a
jury
trial
provision
and
at
present
time,
there
is
a
bill
in
the
house
and
in
the
senate
which
is
supported
by
the
united
states
attorney
general's
office
which
among
other
things
eliminates
the
provision
for
a
jury
trial
for
juveniles.
the
president's
prime
commission
report,
in
their
report
they
state
that
they
do
not
feel
that
a
jury
trial
serves
any
purpose
in
a
juvenile
proceeding.
the
uniform
juvenile
court
act
does
not
provide
for
a
jury
trial
and
the
model
rules
for
a
juvenile
court
much
is
prepared
by
the
national
council
of
juvenile
judges
does
not
provide
for
a
jury
trial
in
a
juvenile
court.
really,
one
other
problem
that
you
have
in
connection
with
a
jury
trial
for
a
juvenile
court,
in
a
juvenile
court,
is
the
matter
of
finding
a
jury
of
peers.
really,
the
juvenile
judge
who
by
dealing
with
these
children
all
the
time
is
less
apt
to
be
shocked
by
the
long
hair,
by
the
mannerisms,
by
the
things
that
the
children
do
than
the
average
person
from
off
of
the
street.
your
juvenile
judge
is
actually
closer
to
being
a
peer
of
the
juvenile
than
all
of
the
juries
as
they
are
selected
now.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes.
they
just
had
recent
legislation
your
honor,
there
used
to
be
25
i
believe
and
they
reduced
it
to
either
20
or
21.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
no,
there's
no
provision
for
teenage
jurors.
so
far
as
the
duncan
rule,
the
reason
for
this
rule
was
the
compliant
or
the
bias
or
the
eccentric
judge,
for
protection
against
this
type
of
thing.
where
in
juvenile
court,
any
judicially
oriented
juvenile
court
has
another
provision
which
protects
against
the
same
thing,
the
trial
de
novo,
and
either
the
district
court
or
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
if
the
court
please,
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
reference
to
the
young
lad
debacker
being
in
the
state
reformatory,
that
he
is
there
under
a
transfer
statute
which
is
not
involve
with
deciding
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
jury
in
juvenile
cases.
this
is
a
transfer
statute
where
the
young
man
is
transferred
after
a
hearing
at
corny,
and
i
maintain
that
the
method
to
attack
this
is
to
bring
a
habeas
corpus
at
the
penal
complex
to
decide
whether
this
transfer
statute
is
unconstitutional.
this
is
a
separate
matter
that
should
be
determined.
the
only
thing
here
is
whether
or
not
the
trial
of
the
young
man
in
county
court
or
in
the
juvenile
court
need
be
with
a
jury,
and
the
fact
that
he
was
eventually
transferred
to
the
men’s
reformatory
doesn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
this
jury
question.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
no,
there
hasn’t.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
i
maintain
that
this--
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
this
is
the
way
to
attack
it
rather
than
to
say
that
the
statute
which
says
that
the
juvenile
is
not
entitled
to
a
jury
should
be
attacked.
the
attack
should
be
against
the
statute
that
allows
the
transfer
rather
than
the
statute
on
the
jury.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
he
is.
the
nebraska
juvenile
code
is
oriented
along
judicial
lines
rather
than
along
social
welfare
lines.
we
have
included
in
the
nebraska
statute
the
notice,
which
has
always
been
there
for
years
even
prior
to
gault,
of
the
right
to
counsel,
of
the
right
to
confrontation,
the
right
to
self-in--
against
self-incrimination,
the
right
to
cross-examination,
the
right
to
a
transcript
of
the
proceedings,
the
right
to
appellate
review.
all
of
these
things
have
always
been
a
part
of
nebraska’s
juvenile
court
law,
and
this
is
the
matter
of
the
determination
of
due
process.
the
fact
that
the
youngsters
have
always
had
this
that
this
is
oriented
along
judicial
lines
rather
than
along
social
welfare
lines.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
if
the
court
please
the
appellant
yesterday
mentioned
that
you
would
accept
the
measure
of
involuntary
custody.
it's
a
matter
of
determination
is
to
whether
or
not
the
jury
trial
guarantee
in
a
criminal
case
applies
to
juvenile
court
proceedings.
of
course,
we
have
that
in
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
--
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
he
is
in
the
men's
reformatory
which
is
a
part
of
the
penal
complex.
he
is
no
longer
in
the
training
school
to
which
he
was
ordered
by
the
court.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
record
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
no.
this
occurs
as
a
matter
of
transfer
by
the
department
of
institutions
through
a
statute.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes.
the
basis
for
the
transfer
is
a
matter
of
the
statute
sets
out
if
they
become
incorrigible
they
can
be
transferred
and
it
was
based
on
this
that
he
was
transferred.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
by
habeas
corpus,
then
at
the
penal
complex
now
to
test
the
sufficiency
or
the
constitutionality
of
this
transfer
rather
than
through
the
juvenile
jury
system.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
there
is
a
hearing
before
the
--
within
the
board
of
pardons
and
the
--
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
department
of
public
institution,
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
there
is
a
hearing
that
determines
this.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
held
--
i'm
not
certain
just
where
they
hold
it.
i
would
assume,
i'm
not
familiar
with
this
part,
but
i
would
assume
that
they
hold
it
at
the
training
school
at
carnegie
where
the
boy
is.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
that
i
don't
know
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
no.
no,
i
wouldn't
call
that
a
hearing.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
i'm
not
familiar
with
this
part
of
the
of
it
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
the
--
yes
sir.
basically,
yes
your
honor.
the
commitment
is
for
an
indeterminant
period
of
time.
there
is
never
a
time
stated
in
the
order.
they
are
committed
to
the
institution
and
whenever
the
institution
feels
that
they
are
ready
for
release,
they
will
release
them.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
the
longest
period
of
time
that
they
can
be
kept
is
until
they
are
21.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
the
amount
of
time
is
limited
to
two
years
by
the
statute.
they
can
only
commit
them
for
a
term
of
two
years
to
the
penal
complex
under
this
administrative
custody.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
i'm
not
certain
your
honor.
i
would
believe
that
they
could,
but
i
couldn't
be
certain.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
right.
this
is
my
contention
that
this
is
another
matter
which
should
be
taken
up.
but
on
the
other
side
of
this
is
a
matter
of
the
benefits
which
a
child
receives
from
a
judicially
oriented
juvenile
court
system.
this
against
the
involuntary
custody
idea
in
the
training
school,
not
in
the
penal
complex.
there
was
some
mentioned
yesterday
of
the
delinquency
of
being
a
violation
of
statute.
this
is
the
definition
that
the
nebraska
statutes
have
of
being
a
delinquent,
any
one
who
violates
any
of
the
state
statutes
or
municipal
ordinances,
but
it's
more
than
just
a
violation
that
is
involved
that
can
involve
involuntary
custody.
the
child
in
need
of
special
supervision
can
be
disposed
of
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
a
child
who
is
being
charged
of
being
a
delinquent
child
which
involves
the
commitment
to
the
training
school
or
to
a
foster
home
or
probation
or
any
of
the
other
avenues
open
so
far
as
a
delinquent
child
is
concerned.
i
might
note
in
passing
that
even
after
a
criminal
trial,
the
district
judge
has
the
option
if
he
wishes
to
send
the
boy
to
the
training
school
instead
of
sending
him
to
the
penal
complex.
the
fact
that
he
has
been
convicted
in
district
court
by
a
jury,
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
he
is
going
to
the
penal
complex.
he
could
be
sent
to
the
training
school
if
the
court
felt
that
this
was
a
proper
disposition
of
the
case.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
no.
he
cannot
be
sent
directly
from
the
juvenile
court
to
a
penal
institution.
he
must
--
the
only
place
they
can
commit
him
is
to
a
training
school
or
to
some
foster
home
or
some
other
disposition.
they
cannot
sentence
to
the
penal
complex.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
this
would
be
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
incorrigibility
is
the
one
that
i
can
recall
right
off
hand
as
a
basis
for
the
transfer,
but
actually
and
with
even
neglected
their
dependent
children
if
you're
talking
about
involuntary
custody,
a
neglected
or
dependent
child
can
be
taken
from
his
home
and
placed
in
some
other
home,
be
at
a
state
home
for
children
or
what
it
maybe.
so,
even
with
a
dependent
or
a
neglected
child,
there
can
still
be
a
matter
of
involuntary
custody
so
to
speak
involved.
if
this
can
be
is
the
measure
of
whether
or
not
it
is
a
criminal
matter
guaranteed
a
jury
trial
under
the
sixth
amendment
which
guarantees
a
jury
trial
in
the
criminal
matters.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
in
a
foster
home
or
it
could
be
in
a
state
institution,
a
state
home
for
children
for
this
type
of
thing.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
the
child
in
need
of
special
supervision
can
be
handled
the
same
as
the
delinquent
child.
the
disposition
can
be
the
same.
however,
there
is
one
restriction
that
in
order
for
child
in
need
of
special
supervision
to
be
committed
to
an
institution
in
the
first
instance,
there
must
be
a
showing
that
it
is
for
the
--
that
is
necessary
for
the
protection
of
the
welfare
of
the
child
or
of
society
in
general.
and
this
must
be
specifically
shown
alleged
in
the
petition
which
is
served
and
shown
at
the
hearing
before
they
can
be
committed
in
the
first
instance.
otherwise,
there
must
be
probation
and/or
some
other
type
of
disposition
and
if
after
a
period
of
time,
it's
shown
that
there
is
not
been
the
rehabilitation
that
should
be,
they
can
then
be
brought
back
into
court
and
they
can
be
sent
to
the
training
school.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes.
so
far
as
the
benefits
of
not
having
the
jury
trial
and
juvenile
court
of
concern,
the
two
main
things
are
the
promptness
of
the
disposition
and
avoiding
the
trauma
of
a
public
hearing.
so
far
as
the
prompt
hearing
is
concerned,
the
jury
trial
in
and
of
itself
is
a
delay.
just
simply
setting
up
a
jury
trial
where
in
addition
to
the
people
involved
in
the
thing,
you
must
get
either
six
or
12
other
people
at
a
certain
place
at
a
certain
time.
schedule
--
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
they
do
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
i
believe
there
are
12
jurisdictions
i
believe,
i'm
not
sure
that's
all
states.
the
district
of
columbia
does
have
provision
for
a
jury
trial
in
their
proceedings.
i
might
point
out
that
according
to
judge
miller's
testimony
before
the
senate
that
there
were
approximately
10%
of
the
juveniles
that
asked
for
a
jury
trial
and
this
10%
asking
for
a
jury
trial
has
caused
approximately
a
six-year
backlog
in
these
trials.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes.
this
is
what
--
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
pardon?
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
i
would
assume
that
it
is
because
of
the
other
business
of
the
court
that
they
can
only
schedule
one
per
week.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
one
jury
trial,
yes,
one
jury
trial
per
week.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
there
were
approximately
--
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
i
think
this
is
what
the
judge
--
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
this
is
what
the
judge
was
asking
for.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
pardon?
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
by
increasing
it,
there
were
approximately
2,500
cases
that
were
handled
during
this
year.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes.
this
is
true.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
well,
this
presents
a
problem.
it
was
pointed
out
here
yesterday
that
in
colorado
where
they
allow
jury
trials
that
there
were
only
two
over
a
certain
period
of
time.
however,
i
believe
this
was
prior
to
gault
when
the
attorney
was
injected
into
the
juvenile
court
proceedings.
since
that
time,
there
had
been
more
and
more
juveniles
with
an
attorney.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes.
well,
this
presents
a
problem,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
he
can
get
it
with
by
waiving
a
jury
trial,
by
pleading
--
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
this
brings
up
the
problem
of
how
does
he
waive
it?
how
does
a
youngster
waive
it?
attorneys
are
becoming
more
and
more
hesitant
about
waiving
for
a
youngster
because
of
the
fact
that
he
will
discuss
it
with
the
youngster
and
the
youngster
will
say
later,
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
i
would
say
--
i
would
say
they
should.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
but
can
the
parent
--
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
i
don't
know
that
they
would
be
giving
up
the
benefits
of
a
court
by
asking
for
a
jury
trial.
i
don't
think
that
this
would
necessarily
be
so.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
oh
yes,
he
could.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
the
problem
is
that
the
attorneys
become
hesitant
about
waiving
because
can
a
parent
waive
for
a
child
or
does
the
child
have
to
understand
is
the
child
that
has
--
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
in
our
proceedings
at
least,
they
are.
the
matters
discussed
with
the
parents
and
with
the
child.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
you
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
if
there
are
a
number
of
these,
there
can
be
a
long
delay
during
the
period
when
they
readjusting
for
this.
these
things
can't
happen
immediately.
during
this
period
of
time,
something
has
to
be
done
with
these
youngsters.
they're
at
this
time
they're
in
their
formative
years.
they're
in
the
period
of
time
when
they
are
forming
themselves
for
later
life
and
by
not
correcting
the
thing
immediately
or
as
close
to
the
time
of
the
incident
as
possible,
you're
really
doing
damage
to
the
child
rather
than
helping
him.
you're
hindering
the
child.
you're
burdening
the
child
with
something
that
he
shouldn't
be.
you're
burdening
him
with
the
delay
that
is
really
bad
for
him.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
and
this
my
question
is,
is
this
right?
is
this
fair
to
thrust
this
thing
in?
i'm
not
sure
i
don't
have
any
figures
state
wide
in
the
particular
county
in
which
i
am;
population
approximately
35,000.
i
would
say
that
we
run
30
to
35
juvenile
cases
a
year
in
the
juvenile
court.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes
sir.
we
use
the
--
there,
we
use
the
county
judge
which
--
who
serves
as
probate
judge
and
has
a
--
it
doesn't
have
general
jurisdiction,
but
he
has
charge
of
probate
matters
and
we
use
him
as
the
juvenile
judge.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
in
omaha
in
lincoln,
they
do
have
special
juvenile
courts
and
i'm
not
familiar
the
figures
there.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
this
is
very
true.
there
can
be
a
number
of
things.
the
child
--
the
child's
real
problem
is
to
where
he
is,
maybe
his
parents.
this
may
well
be,
maybe
his
parents
haven't
provided
him
with
the
background
that
he
needs.
this
is
a
reason
that
he's
into
this
difficulty.
this
is
a
reason
that
he
is
going
out
and
stolen
or
this
type
of
thing
and
the
parents
maybe
the
real
problem
in
the
thing
and
having
the
parents
waive
or
speak
for
him
isn't
doing
justice
for
the
child.
so
far
as
the
insistence
of
the
appellant
that
he
could
have
won
the
case
in
a
criminal
court
to
a
jury
there
is
other
evidence
that
i
have
which
is
still
in
the
file
which
had
not
used
in
this
court,
in
the
juvenile
court.
i'm
just
as
convinced
that
i
could've
convicted
in
a
criminal
case,
however,
my
decision
was
that
the
possibilities
for
using
the
juvenile
court
could
possibly
save
this
young
man
and
this
was
the
reason
that
he
was
taken
into
juvenile
court
rather
than
taking
into
the
criminal
court.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
no,
i
have
discretion
on
at
any
age.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
i
would
have
discretion
there
too.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
no,
no.
the
top
age
is
18.
when
they
reach
their
18th
birthday,
they
are
no
longer
subject
to
the
juvenile
court.
then,
they
must
go
directly
into
criminal
court.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes.
so
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned.
by
way
of
background,
we
do
have
the
presumption
that
a
7-year-old
cannot
form
intent
and
that
someone
between
7
and
the
14,
it's
a
rebuttable
presumption
whether
or
not
they
can.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
it
was
touched
upon
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
i
don't
believe
that
court's
opinion
mentioned
it,
but
it
was
simply
touched
upon
and
--
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
the
closest
thing
to
it
is
the
fugate
versus
ronin
case
where
they
say
that
the
prosecutor
has
an
absolute
discretion
in
it
which
is
putting
with
this
--
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes,
which
is
the
basic
concept
of
the
prosecution
throughout
all
of
the
united
states,
that
prosecutor
has
discretion
as
to
what
he
will
file
or
whether
it
would
be
misdemeanor,
felony
or
whatever
it
maybe.
so
far
as
other
jurisdictions
which
or
other
people
which
feel
that
a
jury
trial
should
not
be
had,
there
are
of
course
34
states
which
do
not
provide
for
a
jury
trial.
of
course
the
district
of
columbia
as
i've
mentioned
before
does
have
a
jury
trial
provision
and
at
present
time,
there
is
a
bill
in
the
house
and
in
the
senate
which
is
supported
by
the
united
states
attorney
general's
office
which
among
other
things
eliminates
the
provision
for
a
jury
trial
for
juveniles.
the
president's
prime
commission
report,
in
their
report
they
state
that
they
do
not
feel
that
a
jury
trial
serves
any
purpose
in
a
juvenile
proceeding.
the
uniform
juvenile
court
act
does
not
provide
for
a
jury
trial
and
the
model
rules
for
a
juvenile
court
much
is
prepared
by
the
national
council
of
juvenile
judges
does
not
provide
for
a
jury
trial
in
a
juvenile
court.
really,
one
other
problem
that
you
have
in
connection
with
a
jury
trial
for
a
juvenile
court,
in
a
juvenile
court,
is
the
matter
of
finding
a
jury
of
peers.
really,
the
juvenile
judge
who
by
dealing
with
these
children
all
the
time
is
less
apt
to
be
shocked
by
the
long
hair,
by
the
mannerisms,
by
the
things
that
the
children
do
than
the
average
person
from
off
of
the
street.
your
juvenile
judge
is
actually
closer
to
being
a
peer
of
the
juvenile
than
all
of
the
juries
as
they
are
selected
now.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
yes.
they
just
had
recent
legislation
your
honor,
there
used
to
be
25
i
believe
and
they
reduced
it
to
either
20
or
21.
mr.
richard
l.
kuhlman
no,
there's
no
provision
for
teenage
jurors.
so
far
as
the
duncan
rule,
the
reason
for
this
rule
was
the
compliant
or
the
bias
or
the
eccentric
judge,
for
protection
against
this
type
of
thing.
where
in
juvenile
court,
any
judicially
oriented
juvenile
court
has
another
provision
which
protects
against
the
same
thing,
the
trial
de
novo,
and
either
the
district
court
or
in
the
supreme
court.
