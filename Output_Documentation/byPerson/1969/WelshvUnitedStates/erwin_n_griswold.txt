mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
difficult
troublesome
case.
i
hope
that
i
can
be
of
assistance
to
the
court
in
coming
to
a
solemn
solution
of
the
problem
that
presents.
the
statutory
provision
is
clear.
it
is
set
out
near
the
top
of
page
9
of
the
government's
brief.
at
the
time
the
events
occurred
here.
this
court
had
already
decided
the
case
of
united
states
against
seeger
but
the
statutory
provision
still
contain
the
language
which
appears
at
the
middle
of
page
9.
defining
religious
training
and
belief
as
belief
in
a
relation
to
a
supreme
being
involving
duties
superior
to
those
arising
from
many
human
relation
but
does
not
include
essentially
political,
sociological
or
philosophical
views
or
a
merely
personal
moral
code.
in
1967,
this
was
amended
to
strike
out
the
reference
to
a
supreme
being.
so
that
it
now
says
simply
the
term
“religious
training
and
belief”
does
not
include
essentially
political,
sociological
or
philosophical
views
or
a
merely
personal
moral
code.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
so
clear.
the
majority
of
the
court
below
felt
that
the
defendant
had
raised
no
constitutional
question
there.
applying
the
statute
to
the
facts
in
the
record
and
taking
into
account
the
narrow
scope
of
review
in
these
cases,
the
court
concluded
with
judge
hamley
dissenting
that
there
was
a
basis
in
fact
for
the
conclusion
of
the
selective
service
authorities
that
welsh's
objections
to
service
were
not
based
on
religious
training
and
belief
and
thus
that
he
did
not
come
within
this
court's
decision
in
the
seeger
case.
the
hearing
officer
who
met
and
talked
with
him
reported
that
he
and
i
quote,
“he
stressed
that
his
belief
is
that
his
opinions
have
been
formed
by
reading
in
the
fields
of
history
and
sociology
and
that
they
are
purely
rational
as
opposed
to
religious.
of
course,
we
fully
accept
the
construction
of
the
statute
made
by
this
court
in
the
seeger
case.
the
statute
which
provides
exemption
for
military
service
for
persons
who,
in
this
statutory
language
by
religious
training
and
belief
are
oppose
to
war
in
any
form.
nevertheless,
there
was
nothing
there
in
the
seeger
case
which
wrote
out
all
content
from
the
word
“religious”
and
which
was
applied
to
training
and
belief
in
that
statute
by
congress.
it
does
seem
to
us
that
the
whole
that
the
position
of
the
defendant
here
comes
within
the
statutory
provision
would
be
plainly
contrary
to
the
manifested
congressional
intent.
after
all,
congress
did
say
religious
training
and
belief.
i
turn
then
to
the
constitutional
question,
if
the
court
should
conclude
that
that
question
is
open
to
the
petitioner
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
his
draft
board
had
found
that
he
team
within
the
statute
and
there
was
not
evidence
on
which
it
could
have
found
otherwise,
then
he
would've
been
entitled
to
one
or
the
other
of
two
classifications
either
1-a-o
or
1-o.
now,
1-a-o
is
available
for
a
military
service
but
noncombatant.
essentially,
a
medical
service,
they
are
put
in
but
sometimes
other
types
of
service.
1-o
would
be
completely
exempt
from
military
service
but
subject
to
civilian
service
of
the
statute
says
national
importance
and
they
are
usually
assigned
to
civilian
hospitals
or
to
other
types
of
nonmilitary
work.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
exactly,
mr.
justice.
at
the
time
that
they
are
so
classified,
they
are
entitled
to
the
other
classifications
2-s
for
students
and
4-f
for
help
and
3
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
(voice
overlap)
3
for
independency
but
if
they
get
classified
1-a
then
they
can
contend
that
they
are
entitled
to
1-o
or
1-a-o
indeed,
they
can
contend
for
that
before
they
are
classified
1-a,
and
if
they
are
so
classified,
they
are
ordered
to
serve
but
in
the
alternative
capacities.
indeed,
the
civilian
service
is
customarily
called
alternative
service.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
they
are
all
subject
to
service.
there
are
at
least
two
constitutional
provisions
which
are
relevant.
there's
not
only
the
first
amendment
but
also
the
power
explicitly
given
to
congress
by
article
i,
section
8,
clause
12
to
raise
and
support
armies.
now,
this
is
unqualified.
it's
not
limited
at
the
time
of
war
or
otherwise
restricted
except
that
appropriations
for
the
purpose
shall
not
be
longer
than
a
term
of
two
years.
let
us
look
particularly
at
the
first
amendment.
i
need
hardly
say
that
it
provides
that
congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting
in
the
establishment
of
religion
or
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
thereof.
there
are
the
two
clauses,
the
establishment
clause
and
the
free
exercise
clause.
generally,
they
are
in
complete
harmony
but
occasionally
there
is
some
tension
between
them
and
this
may
be
such
a
case.
with
respect
to
the
first
amendment,
i
would
like
to
divide
my
approach
under
several
headings.
these
are
one,
the
text
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
problem
of
this
case,
second,
the
contemporaneous
history,
third
the
subsequent
practical
construction
and
four,
the
precedents.
all
of
these,
i
think
support
our
position
here.
in
most
fields,
that
would
be
enough
though
perhaps
here
and
altogether
they
are
but
a
slender
rift.
first,
the
text,
the
section
--
suggestion
that
what
is
involved
here
is
an
establishment
of
religion
ignores
what
the
members
of
the
first
congress
knew
well.
they
were
thoroughly
familiar
with
established
religions.
they
have
them
in
at
least
virginia,
massachusetts
and
new
hampshire
and
probably
other
states.
indeed,
one
of
their
objections
was
to
make
it
clear
that
congress
could
do
nothing
to
interfere
with
these
existing
established
churches.
i
know
that
an
establishment
has
been
carried
further
but
to
take
it
as
far
as
would
be
required
here.
would
be
it
seems
to
me
the
case
of
the
tyranny
of
words
of
what
then
chief
justice
cardozo
referred
to
as
the
tendency
of
a
principle
to
expand
itself
to
the
limit
of
its
logic.
my
one-time
colleague
paul
freund
in
his
book
on
law
and
justice
has
a
passage
which
seems
to
me
they'd
be
relevant
here.
he
was
referring
to
this
court's
dealing
of
problems
with
respect
to
the
regulation
of
commerce
and
i
quote,
“marshall's
exuberant
nationalism
sought
to
solve
the
problem
with
clear
cut
absolutes.
the
power
over
commerce
among
the
states
is
exclusively
vested
in
congress.
the
power
to
tax
involves
the
power
to
destroy.
goods
in
the
original
package
are
immune
from
local
taxation
when
brought
in
from
a
sister
state.”
all
of
these
absolutes
have
had
to
be
abandoned.
what
had
used
to
compare
his
views
of
the
world
with
that
and
his
friend
bert
and
russell?
bert
sees
it
at
that
noon
on
a
brilliant
sunny
day.
i
see
at
that
dawn
on
a
misty
morning
john
marshall
was
however
improbable
to
spiritual
ancestry
of
periods
and
other
respect
the
brick
precursor
of
bert
and
russell.
in
his
view
of
national
and
state
powers
over
commerce,
over
bert
and
russell
in
his
view
of
national
and
state
powers
over
commerce
has
not
a
century
and
a
half
of
experience
shown
that
the
white
headway
was
the
path
of
greater
wisdom.
and
then
part
from
the
text
of
the
amendment,
the
contemporaneous
history
and
understanding
of
the
first
amendment.
it
was
for
this
reason
that
i
had
the
argument
portion
of
the
seeger
brief
reprinted
and
made
available
for
the
convenience
not
only
of
the
court
but
of
counsel.
there
is
a
more
reprinted
here
than
a
strict
be
necessary
to
my
present
argument
but
i
was
fearful
that
if
i
didn't
included
all
someone
might
say
that
it
was
not
fully
representative
of
our
position
and
i'm
particularly
interested
in
the
fact
that
on
pages
26
(a)
to
45
(a),
there
was
set
out
by
solicitor
general
cox
in
his
step
a
full
discussion
of
the
historical
development
of
the
first
amendment.
i
had
first
thought
that
we
would
--
we
worked
that
and
then
i
concluded
that
we
were
not
going
to
able
to
improve
on
it.
i
then
thought
we
would
simply
cite
it
in
our
brief
that
i
thought
that
might
be
inconvenient
and
so
i
had
this
supplement
prepared.
it's
perfectly
plain
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it's
a
--
has
a
great
cover
like
all
government
documents,
it
is
called
the
supplement
to
brief
for
the
united
states
and
i
hope
that
it
is
made
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it's
called
supplement
to
brief
for
the
united
states.
there
is
first
that
pre-revolutionary
relief
which
was
habitually
given
by
nearly
all
of
the
colonies
to
the
members
of
the
four-historic
piece
churches.
there
were
actions,
similar
actions
by
the
continental
congress
then
there
was
the
consideration
of
the
bill
of
rights
in
the
first
congress.
there
were
numerous
state
proposals
relating
to
churches
and
this
show
that
what
was
in
the
minds
of
those
who
sought
amendments
on
religion
were
three
concerns.
they
feared
that
congress
might
one,
infringe
religious
liberty.
two,
establish
or
record
preferential
treatment
to
one
particular
religious
sect.
and
three,
undermine
the
existing
state
religious
establishments.
when
the
--
what
became
the
first
amendment
was
under
consideration
in
congress.
the
proposal
of
james
madison
was
that
the
provision
read
that
no
person
religiously
scrupulous
shall
be
compelled
to
bear
arms.
representative
scott
made
a
very
similar
proposal
which
is
printed
at
the
bottom
of
page
31
(a)
of
our
briefs.
the
provision
which
was
adopted
by
the
house
simply
referred
to
establishment,
a
religion.
congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting
and
establishment
of
rel
--
no
that's
what
the
final
provision
was.
congress
shall
make
no
law
establishing
articles
of
faith
or
a
mode
of
worship.
it
then
went
to
the
senate
where
we
have
no
information
as
to
what
happened
and
the
senate
version
plainly
related
to
establishment
in
the
sense
of
an
established
church.
it
then
went
to
a
conference
from
which
the
final
version
was
adopted.
similarly,
in
connection
with
the
war
of
1812,
that
is
set
out
on
page
33
(a)
of
the
supplement.
the
provision
which
was
adopted
by
one
house
relating
to
the
historic
piece
churches
never
enacted
in
the
law
because
the
treaty
terminating
the
war
that
became
known
before
the
statute
was
passed.
now,
there
is
of
course
jefferson's
wall
of
separation
but
he
was
not
one
of
the
draftsmen
of
the
first
amendment.
he
was
in
france
in
1789.
he's
striking
phrase
came
a
number
of
years
later
and
may
have
become
an
example
of
what
again
quoting
judge
cardozo
what
he
had
in
mind
when
he
observed
that
the
search
is
for
the
just
word
the
happy
phrase
that
will
give
expression
to
the
thought
but
somehow
the
thought
itself
is
transfigured
by
the
phrase
when
found.
and
then
we
have
on
page
35
(a)
of
the
supplement
of
the
statute
which
was
passed
during
the
civil
war.
both
the
confederate
congress
and
the
united
states
congress
and
all
of
the
provision
of
the
united
states
congress
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
35
(a)
but
both
of
them
exempted
members
of
the
established
organizations
that
federal
statute
reads,
that
members
of
religious
denomination
who
shall
by
oath
or
affirmation
declare
that
they
are
conscientiously
oppose
to
the
bearing
of
arms
and
who
are
prohibited
from
doing
so
by
the
rules
and
articles
of
faith
and
practice
of
said
religious
denominations
should
be
entitled
to
a
kind
of
exemption.
and
similarly,
the
statute
which
was
passed
by
congress
in
the
first
world
war,
125
years
after
the
constitution
was
adopted.
the
exempted
members
of
any
well-recognized
religious
sect
or
organization
at
present
organize
in
existing
and
whose
existing
creed
of
principles
forbids
its
members
to
participate
in
war.
that
is
on
page
40
(a)
of
the
supplement.
and
then
finally
turning
to
the
precedents,
there
is
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
selective
draft
law
cases
cited
on
page
20
of
our
brief.
where
this
question
was
briefed
and
argued
by
a
john
w.
davis,
solicitor
general
and
where
the
court
treated
it
rather
summarily.
it
is
not
usually
noted
but
i
think
it
is
relevant
to
note
here
that
one
week
later,
the
court
decided
on
the
authority
of
the
selected
draft
law
cases.
the
rothenberg
case
in
245
u.s.
480
where
the
contention
was
specifically
made
that
allowing
exemption
to
members
of
a
religious
sect
violated
the
first
amendment
and
the
court
found
that
that
could
be
disposed
off
on
the
basis
of
the
selective
draft
law
cases.
there's
also
the
free
exercise
clause.
it's
obvious
that
congress
has
over
the
year
and
legislated
within
the
influence
of
that
clause.
that
congress
has
endeavored
to
accommodate
the
various
draft
laws
it
has
passed,
the
claims
made
under
the
free
exercise
clause.
several
cases
decided
by
this
court
within
the
past
few
decades
support
the
power
of
congress
to
make
such
an
accommodation.
on
page
21
of
our
brief,
we
have
cited
the
everson
case
where
the
court
found
that
the
public
money
could
be
used
to
pay
the
cost
of
transporting
students
to
schools
even
though
some
of
the
students
went
to
parochial
schools.
on
page
21,
we
also
cited
the
zorach
against
clauson,
the
released
time
case
where
it
was
held
that
it
was
valid
under
the
first
amendment
for
public
authority
to
release
children
from
school
to
attend
religious
educational
classes.
then,
there
are
the
sunday
closing
law
cases
decided
on
pages
22
and
23
of
our
brief
which
not
only
it
seems
to
me
a
relevant
and
in
involving
the
interrelation
of
law
and
the
first
amendment
but
also
the
particular
fact
that
it
appeared
that
in
21
of
34
states
which
had
sunday
laws
there
were
exemptions
for
sabbatarians
and
provisions
that
if
they
kept
closed
on
saturdays
they
could
be
open
sunday
and
the
court
at
page
608
of
366
u.s.
said
and
i
quote,
”this
may
well
be
the
wise
solution
to
the
problem”
and
that
of
course
was
a
clear
accommodation.
there
are
analogies
in
other
statutes
passed
by
congress.
for
example,
this
very
statute,
the
selective
draft
law,
it
contains
an
outright
exemption
for
ministers
and
for
the
divinity
students
with
which
this
court
as
dealt
in
the
(inaudible)
case
not
suggesting
at
all
that
the
exemption
was
unconstitutional.
there
are
numerous
provisions
in
the
tax
laws
not
only
allowing
deductions
for
contributions
to
churches.
there
is
in
section
1402
(a)
8
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
a
special
rule
for
computing
the
self-employment
income
of
an
individual
who
is
a
duly
ordained
commissioned
or
licensed
minister
of
a
church
or
a
member
of
a
religious
order.
in
1402
(h),
there
is
a
really
rather
choice
on
exemption
for
persons
who
are
members
of
a
recognized
religious
sect
or
division
thereof
and
are
adherence
of
established
tenants
or
teachings
of
such
sect
or
division
by
reason
of
which
they
are
conscientiously
opposed
to
acceptance
of
the
benefits
of
any
private
or
public
insurance
which
makes
payments
for
death,
disability
or
old
age
or
retirement
or
for
medical
care.
persons
who
are
within
a
particular
division
or
sect
of
a
religious
group
which
objects
to
social
insurance
have
an
exemption.
the
propriety
of
the
exemption
based
our
religious
training
and
belief
has
at
least
been
recognized
and
accepted
by
this
court
in
recent
years.
there
is
first
i
would
mention
the
whitmore
case
in

u.s.
where
the
court
said
because
the
ultimate
question
in
conscientior
objective
cases
is
the
sincerity
of
the
registrant
in
objecting
on
religious
grounds
to
participation
and
more
in
any
form.
and
then
finally,
there
is
a
seeger
case
itself
where
the
notion
or
the
idea
that
the
restriction
to
religious
training
and
belief
was
valid
is
surely
implicit.
it's
perfectly
plain
of
course
that
the
court
gave
a
very
broad
construction
to
the
meaning
of
religious
training
and
belief
to
which
we
take
no
exception
whatever
but
there
is
nothing
in
that
case
which
indicates
that
the
court
was
intending
to
write
the
word
“religious”
out
of
the
statute
or
to
holds
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
indeed,
if
the
religious
training
and
belief
provision
is
invalid
why
does
not
the
whole
exemption
provision
fall
which
would
lead
to
the
affirmance
of
the
judgment
below.
there's
nothing
arbitrary
or
capricious
violative
of
the
fifth
amendment
in
the
judgment
congress
has
made.
the
test
of
drawing
the
line
is
an
exceptionally
difficult
one
but
we
believe
that
there
is
a
qualitative
difference.
a
difference
of
degree
perhaps
but
none
the
worst
for
that
between
religious
and
nonreligious
objection
to
war
which
congress
could
reasonably
recognized
in
deciding
whom
to
subject
to
involuntary
military
service.
the
constitution
does
not
set
up
freedom
of
conscience
despite
appealing
arguments
made
in
brief
amicus
curiae
to
the
effect
that
that
might
be
a
good
thing
to
do.
it
does
not
equate
conscience
with
religion.
congress
could
reasonably
draw
the
line
as
to
who
shall
and
who
shall
not
be
compelled
to
serve
by
taking
into
account
as
the
constitution
does
the
right
to
exercise
one's
religion
freely.
this
was
an
appropriate
place
for
legislative
judgment
that
congress
has
power
to
make
this
judgment
is
in
our
view
implicit
in
the
power
expressly
granted
to
raise
and
maintain
armies.
the
test
of
reconciling
the
constitutional
commands
of
the
establishment
and
the
free
exercise
clause
is
not
exclusively
a
matter
of
judicial
concern.
courts
are
not
the
only
agencies
of
our
government
which
are
bound
to
support
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
in
circumstances
where
the
tension
between
these
provisions
is
taken,
the
preferable
course
for
the
courts
to
follow
is
to
set
outer
limits
but
to
live
the
legislature
considerable
school
or
the
alternative
is
to
substitute
judicial
attitudes
for
those
of
the
elective
representatives
of
the
people
on
matters
where
the
constitutional
lines
are
not
clear
and
where
the
considered
views
of
the
representatives
of
the
people
is
entitled
a
great
weight.
the
sound
constitutional
approach
in
construing
the
establishment
clause
in
such
circumstances
is
one
of
reasonable
accommodation
not
with
an
application
of
thoughtful
resolution
of
difficult
problems
and
not
formalistic
absolutes
and
that
is
the
approach
we
raise
here.
the
petitioner
has
raised
a
further
question
and
i
would
point
out
that
in
--
though
i
don't
want
to
be
technical
that
in
the
petition
in
this
case
only
two
questions
were
raised,
only
first
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
there
is
no
question
presented
as
to
whether
the
petitioner
comes
within
the
statute.
and
second,
this
technical
question
about
his
failure
to
sign
a
form
a
time
of
induction.
this
latter
question,
we
have
dealt
within
our
brief
and
i
leave
consideration
of
it
to
the
discussion
there.
for
these
reasons,
i
urge
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
am
not
planning
to
argue
more
about
religion
in
sisson.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
are
two
problems
in
this
simple
little
statutory
phrase
by
reason
of
religious
training
and
belief
is
opposed
to
war
in
any
form
and
this
is
the
argument
i
propose
to
make
about
religion.
both
questions
are
involves
in
the
sisson
case
and
the
argument
there
is
essentially
that
i
--
the
way
i
planned
it
is
to
deal
essentially
with
the
selective
conscientious
objection
there.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
know
mr.
justice
that
i
can
say
much
more
than
i
have.
my
first
argument
on
that
would
be
that
the
establishment
clause
have
been
pushed
very
far
and
it
ought
to
be
pushed
any
further
or
more
specifically
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
more
specifically
that
it
ought
not
to
be
push
to
apply
to
this
particular
situation
and
i
can
find
no
doctrinal
or
historical
basis
on
which
it
should
be
indeed
all
the
evidence
seems
to
me
to
be
the
--
to
the
contrary.
the
other
question
is
what
i
tried
to
deal
with
very
summarily
to
short
the
time,
but
it
seems
to
me
to
be
essentially
a
fifth
amendment
question
that
is
whether
it
is
a
proper
classification.
a
classification
which
congress
could
reasonably
make
and
not
be
arbitrary
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
allow
exemption
to
persons
by
reason
of
real
--
all
these
views
by
reason
of
religious
training
and
belief
and
not
to
allow
them
to
others.
and
on
that,
here
again,
feeling
is
much
as
argument
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
that
i
suppose.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
an
argument
can
be
made
that
there
is
a
difference
in
quality
between
objections
which
in
the
broadest
base
are
religious
in
nature
having
some
connotation
with
the
unknown
with
the
unknown
with
what's
above
now
beyond
this.
on
the
one
hand
and
those
which
are
merely
intellectual,
merely
rational,
merely
internal
on
the
other.
that
is
an
argument
which
isn't
easy
for
me
to
verbalize
because
in
the
quicker
tradition
that
i'm
familiar
with,
it's
the
inner
voice
which
expresses
the
external
force.
but
so
that
i
can't
say
it's
just
a
question
whether
it's
external
or
internal.
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
it
relates
to
whether
it
deals
with
the
unknown
and
what
is
beyond
this
on
the
one
hand
and
what
the
man
out
of
his
own
intellectual
activity
rationalizes
to
a
conclusion
for
himself
and
my
position
on
that
would
be
that
that
is
a
classification
--
a
distinction
which
congress
has
made
for
a
175
years
which
was
well
understood
and
contemplated
at
the
time
the
amendment
was
adopted
that
it
would
not
be
a
construction
of
the
constitution
to
say
that
congress
can
not
do
it.
it
would
be
an
extension
of
it
beyond
anything
that
was
contemplated
either
at
its
drafting
or
in
a
century
and
a
half
since
then.
thank
you.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
difficult
troublesome
case.
i
hope
that
i
can
be
of
assistance
to
the
court
in
coming
to
a
solemn
solution
of
the
problem
that
presents.
the
statutory
provision
is
clear.
it
is
set
out
near
the
top
of
page
9
of
the
government's
brief.
at
the
time
the
events
occurred
here.
this
court
had
already
decided
the
case
of
united
states
against
seeger
but
the
statutory
provision
still
contain
the
language
which
appears
at
the
middle
of
page
9.
defining
religious
training
and
belief
as
belief
in
a
relation
to
a
supreme
being
involving
duties
superior
to
those
arising
from
many
human
relation
but
does
not
include
essentially
political,
sociological
or
philosophical
views
or
a
merely
personal
moral
code.
in
1967,
this
was
amended
to
strike
out
the
reference
to
a
supreme
being.
so
that
it
now
says
simply
the
term
“religious
training
and
belief”
does
not
include
essentially
political,
sociological
or
philosophical
views
or
a
merely
personal
moral
code.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
so
clear.
the
majority
of
the
court
below
felt
that
the
defendant
had
raised
no
constitutional
question
there.
applying
the
statute
to
the
facts
in
the
record
and
taking
into
account
the
narrow
scope
of
review
in
these
cases,
the
court
concluded
with
judge
hamley
dissenting
that
there
was
a
basis
in
fact
for
the
conclusion
of
the
selective
service
authorities
that
welsh's
objections
to
service
were
not
based
on
religious
training
and
belief
and
thus
that
he
did
not
come
within
this
court's
decision
in
the
seeger
case.
the
hearing
officer
who
met
and
talked
with
him
reported
that
he
and
i
quote,
“he
stressed
that
his
belief
is
that
his
opinions
have
been
formed
by
reading
in
the
fields
of
history
and
sociology
and
that
they
are
purely
rational
as
opposed
to
religious.
of
course,
we
fully
accept
the
construction
of
the
statute
made
by
this
court
in
the
seeger
case.
the
statute
which
provides
exemption
for
military
service
for
persons
who,
in
this
statutory
language
by
religious
training
and
belief
are
oppose
to
war
in
any
form.
nevertheless,
there
was
nothing
there
in
the
seeger
case
which
wrote
out
all
content
from
the
word
“religious”
and
which
was
applied
to
training
and
belief
in
that
statute
by
congress.
it
does
seem
to
us
that
the
whole
that
the
position
of
the
defendant
here
comes
within
the
statutory
provision
would
be
plainly
contrary
to
the
manifested
congressional
intent.
after
all,
congress
did
say
religious
training
and
belief.
i
turn
then
to
the
constitutional
question,
if
the
court
should
conclude
that
that
question
is
open
to
the
petitioner
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
his
draft
board
had
found
that
he
team
within
the
statute
and
there
was
not
evidence
on
which
it
could
have
found
otherwise,
then
he
would've
been
entitled
to
one
or
the
other
of
two
classifications
either
1-a-o
or
1-o.
now,
1-a-o
is
available
for
a
military
service
but
noncombatant.
essentially,
a
medical
service,
they
are
put
in
but
sometimes
other
types
of
service.
1-o
would
be
completely
exempt
from
military
service
but
subject
to
civilian
service
of
the
statute
says
national
importance
and
they
are
usually
assigned
to
civilian
hospitals
or
to
other
types
of
nonmilitary
work.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
exactly,
mr.
justice.
at
the
time
that
they
are
so
classified,
they
are
entitled
to
the
other
classifications
2-s
for
students
and
4-f
for
help
and
3
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
(voice
overlap)
3
for
independency
but
if
they
get
classified
1-a
then
they
can
contend
that
they
are
entitled
to
1-o
or
1-a-o
indeed,
they
can
contend
for
that
before
they
are
classified
1-a,
and
if
they
are
so
classified,
they
are
ordered
to
serve
but
in
the
alternative
capacities.
indeed,
the
civilian
service
is
customarily
called
alternative
service.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
they
are
all
subject
to
service.
there
are
at
least
two
constitutional
provisions
which
are
relevant.
there's
not
only
the
first
amendment
but
also
the
power
explicitly
given
to
congress
by
article
i,
section
8,
clause
12
to
raise
and
support
armies.
now,
this
is
unqualified.
it's
not
limited
at
the
time
of
war
or
otherwise
restricted
except
that
appropriations
for
the
purpose
shall
not
be
longer
than
a
term
of
two
years.
let
us
look
particularly
at
the
first
amendment.
i
need
hardly
say
that
it
provides
that
congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting
in
the
establishment
of
religion
or
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
thereof.
there
are
the
two
clauses,
the
establishment
clause
and
the
free
exercise
clause.
generally,
they
are
in
complete
harmony
but
occasionally
there
is
some
tension
between
them
and
this
may
be
such
a
case.
with
respect
to
the
first
amendment,
i
would
like
to
divide
my
approach
under
several
headings.
these
are
one,
the
text
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
problem
of
this
case,
second,
the
contemporaneous
history,
third
the
subsequent
practical
construction
and
four,
the
precedents.
all
of
these,
i
think
support
our
position
here.
in
most
fields,
that
would
be
enough
though
perhaps
here
and
altogether
they
are
but
a
slender
rift.
first,
the
text,
the
section
--
suggestion
that
what
is
involved
here
is
an
establishment
of
religion
ignores
what
the
members
of
the
first
congress
knew
well.
they
were
thoroughly
familiar
with
established
religions.
they
have
them
in
at
least
virginia,
massachusetts
and
new
hampshire
and
probably
other
states.
indeed,
one
of
their
objections
was
to
make
it
clear
that
congress
could
do
nothing
to
interfere
with
these
existing
established
churches.
i
know
that
an
establishment
has
been
carried
further
but
to
take
it
as
far
as
would
be
required
here.
would
be
it
seems
to
me
the
case
of
the
tyranny
of
words
of
what
then
chief
justice
cardozo
referred
to
as
the
tendency
of
a
principle
to
expand
itself
to
the
limit
of
its
logic.
my
one-time
colleague
paul
freund
in
his
book
on
law
and
justice
has
a
passage
which
seems
to
me
they'd
be
relevant
here.
he
was
referring
to
this
court's
dealing
of
problems
with
respect
to
the
regulation
of
commerce
and
i
quote,
“marshall's
exuberant
nationalism
sought
to
solve
the
problem
with
clear
cut
absolutes.
the
power
over
commerce
among
the
states
is
exclusively
vested
in
congress.
the
power
to
tax
involves
the
power
to
destroy.
goods
in
the
original
package
are
immune
from
local
taxation
when
brought
in
from
a
sister
state.”
all
of
these
absolutes
have
had
to
be
abandoned.
what
had
used
to
compare
his
views
of
the
world
with
that
and
his
friend
bert
and
russell?
bert
sees
it
at
that
noon
on
a
brilliant
sunny
day.
i
see
at
that
dawn
on
a
misty
morning
john
marshall
was
however
improbable
to
spiritual
ancestry
of
periods
and
other
respect
the
brick
precursor
of
bert
and
russell.
in
his
view
of
national
and
state
powers
over
commerce,
over
bert
and
russell
in
his
view
of
national
and
state
powers
over
commerce
has
not
a
century
and
a
half
of
experience
shown
that
the
white
headway
was
the
path
of
greater
wisdom.
and
then
part
from
the
text
of
the
amendment,
the
contemporaneous
history
and
understanding
of
the
first
amendment.
it
was
for
this
reason
that
i
had
the
argument
portion
of
the
seeger
brief
reprinted
and
made
available
for
the
convenience
not
only
of
the
court
but
of
counsel.
there
is
a
more
reprinted
here
than
a
strict
be
necessary
to
my
present
argument
but
i
was
fearful
that
if
i
didn't
included
all
someone
might
say
that
it
was
not
fully
representative
of
our
position
and
i'm
particularly
interested
in
the
fact
that
on
pages
26
(a)
to
45
(a),
there
was
set
out
by
solicitor
general
cox
in
his
step
a
full
discussion
of
the
historical
development
of
the
first
amendment.
i
had
first
thought
that
we
would
--
we
worked
that
and
then
i
concluded
that
we
were
not
going
to
able
to
improve
on
it.
i
then
thought
we
would
simply
cite
it
in
our
brief
that
i
thought
that
might
be
inconvenient
and
so
i
had
this
supplement
prepared.
it's
perfectly
plain
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it's
a
--
has
a
great
cover
like
all
government
documents,
it
is
called
the
supplement
to
brief
for
the
united
states
and
i
hope
that
it
is
made
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it's
called
supplement
to
brief
for
the
united
states.
there
is
first
that
pre-revolutionary
relief
which
was
habitually
given
by
nearly
all
of
the
colonies
to
the
members
of
the
four-historic
piece
churches.
there
were
actions,
similar
actions
by
the
continental
congress
then
there
was
the
consideration
of
the
bill
of
rights
in
the
first
congress.
there
were
numerous
state
proposals
relating
to
churches
and
this
show
that
what
was
in
the
minds
of
those
who
sought
amendments
on
religion
were
three
concerns.
they
feared
that
congress
might
one,
infringe
religious
liberty.
two,
establish
or
record
preferential
treatment
to
one
particular
religious
sect.
and
three,
undermine
the
existing
state
religious
establishments.
when
the
--
what
became
the
first
amendment
was
under
consideration
in
congress.
the
proposal
of
james
madison
was
that
the
provision
read
that
no
person
religiously
scrupulous
shall
be
compelled
to
bear
arms.
representative
scott
made
a
very
similar
proposal
which
is
printed
at
the
bottom
of
page
31
(a)
of
our
briefs.
the
provision
which
was
adopted
by
the
house
simply
referred
to
establishment,
a
religion.
congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting
and
establishment
of
rel
--
no
that's
what
the
final
provision
was.
congress
shall
make
no
law
establishing
articles
of
faith
or
a
mode
of
worship.
it
then
went
to
the
senate
where
we
have
no
information
as
to
what
happened
and
the
senate
version
plainly
related
to
establishment
in
the
sense
of
an
established
church.
it
then
went
to
a
conference
from
which
the
final
version
was
adopted.
similarly,
in
connection
with
the
war
of
1812,
that
is
set
out
on
page
33
(a)
of
the
supplement.
the
provision
which
was
adopted
by
one
house
relating
to
the
historic
piece
churches
never
enacted
in
the
law
because
the
treaty
terminating
the
war
that
became
known
before
the
statute
was
passed.
now,
there
is
of
course
jefferson's
wall
of
separation
but
he
was
not
one
of
the
draftsmen
of
the
first
amendment.
he
was
in
france
in
1789.
he's
striking
phrase
came
a
number
of
years
later
and
may
have
become
an
example
of
what
again
quoting
judge
cardozo
what
he
had
in
mind
when
he
observed
that
the
search
is
for
the
just
word
the
happy
phrase
that
will
give
expression
to
the
thought
but
somehow
the
thought
itself
is
transfigured
by
the
phrase
when
found.
and
then
we
have
on
page
35
(a)
of
the
supplement
of
the
statute
which
was
passed
during
the
civil
war.
both
the
confederate
congress
and
the
united
states
congress
and
all
of
the
provision
of
the
united
states
congress
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
35
(a)
but
both
of
them
exempted
members
of
the
established
organizations
that
federal
statute
reads,
that
members
of
religious
denomination
who
shall
by
oath
or
affirmation
declare
that
they
are
conscientiously
oppose
to
the
bearing
of
arms
and
who
are
prohibited
from
doing
so
by
the
rules
and
articles
of
faith
and
practice
of
said
religious
denominations
should
be
entitled
to
a
kind
of
exemption.
and
similarly,
the
statute
which
was
passed
by
congress
in
the
first
world
war,
125
years
after
the
constitution
was
adopted.
the
exempted
members
of
any
well-recognized
religious
sect
or
organization
at
present
organize
in
existing
and
whose
existing
creed
of
principles
forbids
its
members
to
participate
in
war.
that
is
on
page
40
(a)
of
the
supplement.
and
then
finally
turning
to
the
precedents,
there
is
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
selective
draft
law
cases
cited
on
page
20
of
our
brief.
where
this
question
was
briefed
and
argued
by
a
john
w.
davis,
solicitor
general
and
where
the
court
treated
it
rather
summarily.
it
is
not
usually
noted
but
i
think
it
is
relevant
to
note
here
that
one
week
later,
the
court
decided
on
the
authority
of
the
selected
draft
law
cases.
the
rothenberg
case
in
245
u.s.
480
where
the
contention
was
specifically
made
that
allowing
exemption
to
members
of
a
religious
sect
violated
the
first
amendment
and
the
court
found
that
that
could
be
disposed
off
on
the
basis
of
the
selective
draft
law
cases.
there's
also
the
free
exercise
clause.
it's
obvious
that
congress
has
over
the
year
and
legislated
within
the
influence
of
that
clause.
that
congress
has
endeavored
to
accommodate
the
various
draft
laws
it
has
passed,
the
claims
made
under
the
free
exercise
clause.
several
cases
decided
by
this
court
within
the
past
few
decades
support
the
power
of
congress
to
make
such
an
accommodation.
on
page
21
of
our
brief,
we
have
cited
the
everson
case
where
the
court
found
that
the
public
money
could
be
used
to
pay
the
cost
of
transporting
students
to
schools
even
though
some
of
the
students
went
to
parochial
schools.
on
page
21,
we
also
cited
the
zorach
against
clauson,
the
released
time
case
where
it
was
held
that
it
was
valid
under
the
first
amendment
for
public
authority
to
release
children
from
school
to
attend
religious
educational
classes.
then,
there
are
the
sunday
closing
law
cases
decided
on
pages
22
and
23
of
our
brief
which
not
only
it
seems
to
me
a
relevant
and
in
involving
the
interrelation
of
law
and
the
first
amendment
but
also
the
particular
fact
that
it
appeared
that
in
21
of
34
states
which
had
sunday
laws
there
were
exemptions
for
sabbatarians
and
provisions
that
if
they
kept
closed
on
saturdays
they
could
be
open
sunday
and
the
court
at
page
608
of
366
u.s.
said
and
i
quote,
”this
may
well
be
the
wise
solution
to
the
problem”
and
that
of
course
was
a
clear
accommodation.
there
are
analogies
in
other
statutes
passed
by
congress.
for
example,
this
very
statute,
the
selective
draft
law,
it
contains
an
outright
exemption
for
ministers
and
for
the
divinity
students
with
which
this
court
as
dealt
in
the
(inaudible)
case
not
suggesting
at
all
that
the
exemption
was
unconstitutional.
there
are
numerous
provisions
in
the
tax
laws
not
only
allowing
deductions
for
contributions
to
churches.
there
is
in
section
1402
(a)
8
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
a
special
rule
for
computing
the
self-employment
income
of
an
individual
who
is
a
duly
ordained
commissioned
or
licensed
minister
of
a
church
or
a
member
of
a
religious
order.
in
1402
(h),
there
is
a
really
rather
choice
on
exemption
for
persons
who
are
members
of
a
recognized
religious
sect
or
division
thereof
and
are
adherence
of
established
tenants
or
teachings
of
such
sect
or
division
by
reason
of
which
they
are
conscientiously
opposed
to
acceptance
of
the
benefits
of
any
private
or
public
insurance
which
makes
payments
for
death,
disability
or
old
age
or
retirement
or
for
medical
care.
persons
who
are
within
a
particular
division
or
sect
of
a
religious
group
which
objects
to
social
insurance
have
an
exemption.
the
propriety
of
the
exemption
based
our
religious
training
and
belief
has
at
least
been
recognized
and
accepted
by
this
court
in
recent
years.
there
is
first
i
would
mention
the
whitmore
case
in
348
u.s.
where
the
court
said
because
the
ultimate
question
in
conscientior
objective
cases
is
the
sincerity
of
the
registrant
in
objecting
on
religious
grounds
to
participation
and
more
in
any
form.
and
then
finally,
there
is
a
seeger
case
itself
where
the
notion
or
the
idea
that
the
restriction
to
religious
training
and
belief
was
valid
is
surely
implicit.
it's
perfectly
plain
of
course
that
the
court
gave
a
very
broad
construction
to
the
meaning
of
religious
training
and
belief
to
which
we
take
no
exception
whatever
but
there
is
nothing
in
that
case
which
indicates
that
the
court
was
intending
to
write
the
word
“religious”
out
of
the
statute
or
to
holds
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
indeed,
if
the
religious
training
and
belief
provision
is
invalid
why
does
not
the
whole
exemption
provision
fall
which
would
lead
to
the
affirmance
of
the
judgment
below.
there's
nothing
arbitrary
or
capricious
violative
of
the
fifth
amendment
in
the
judgment
congress
has
made.
the
test
of
drawing
the
line
is
an
exceptionally
difficult
one
but
we
believe
that
there
is
a
qualitative
difference.
a
difference
of
degree
perhaps
but
none
the
worst
for
that
between
religious
and
nonreligious
objection
to
war
which
congress
could
reasonably
recognized
in
deciding
whom
to
subject
to
involuntary
military
service.
the
constitution
does
not
set
up
freedom
of
conscience
despite
appealing
arguments
made
in
brief
amicus
curiae
to
the
effect
that
that
might
be
a
good
thing
to
do.
it
does
not
equate
conscience
with
religion.
congress
could
reasonably
draw
the
line
as
to
who
shall
and
who
shall
not
be
compelled
to
serve
by
taking
into
account
as
the
constitution
does
the
right
to
exercise
one's
religion
freely.
this
was
an
appropriate
place
for
legislative
judgment
that
congress
has
power
to
make
this
judgment
is
in
our
view
implicit
in
the
power
expressly
granted
to
raise
and
maintain
armies.
the
test
of
reconciling
the
constitutional
commands
of
the
establishment
and
the
free
exercise
clause
is
not
exclusively
a
matter
of
judicial
concern.
courts
are
not
the
only
agencies
of
our
government
which
are
bound
to
support
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
in
circumstances
where
the
tension
between
these
provisions
is
taken,
the
preferable
course
for
the
courts
to
follow
is
to
set
outer
limits
but
to
live
the
legislature
considerable
school
or
the
alternative
is
to
substitute
judicial
attitudes
for
those
of
the
elective
representatives
of
the
people
on
matters
where
the
constitutional
lines
are
not
clear
and
where
the
considered
views
of
the
representatives
of
the
people
is
entitled
a
great
weight.
the
sound
constitutional
approach
in
construing
the
establishment
clause
in
such
circumstances
is
one
of
reasonable
accommodation
not
with
an
application
of
thoughtful
resolution
of
difficult
problems
and
not
formalistic
absolutes
and
that
is
the
approach
we
raise
here.
the
petitioner
has
raised
a
further
question
and
i
would
point
out
that
in
--
though
i
don't
want
to
be
technical
that
in
the
petition
in
this
case
only
two
questions
were
raised,
only
first
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
there
is
no
question
presented
as
to
whether
the
petitioner
comes
within
the
statute.
and
second,
this
technical
question
about
his
failure
to
sign
a
form
a
time
of
induction.
this
latter
question,
we
have
dealt
within
our
brief
and
i
leave
consideration
of
it
to
the
discussion
there.
for
these
reasons,
i
urge
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
am
not
planning
to
argue
more
about
religion
in
sisson.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
are
two
problems
in
this
simple
little
statutory
phrase
by
reason
of
religious
training
and
belief
is
opposed
to
war
in
any
form
and
this
is
the
argument
i
propose
to
make
about
religion.
both
questions
are
involves
in
the
sisson
case
and
the
argument
there
is
essentially
that
i
--
the
way
i
planned
it
is
to
deal
essentially
with
the
selective
conscientious
objection
there.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
know
mr.
justice
that
i
can
say
much
more
than
i
have.
my
first
argument
on
that
would
be
that
the
establishment
clause
have
been
pushed
very
far
and
it
ought
to
be
pushed
any
further
or
more
specifically
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
more
specifically
that
it
ought
not
to
be
push
to
apply
to
this
particular
situation
and
i
can
find
no
doctrinal
or
historical
basis
on
which
it
should
be
indeed
all
the
evidence
seems
to
me
to
be
the
--
to
the
contrary.
the
other
question
is
what
i
tried
to
deal
with
very
summarily
to
short
the
time,
but
it
seems
to
me
to
be
essentially
a
fifth
amendment
question
that
is
whether
it
is
a
proper
classification.
a
classification
which
congress
could
reasonably
make
and
not
be
arbitrary
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
allow
exemption
to
persons
by
reason
of
real
--
all
these
views
by
reason
of
religious
training
and
belief
and
not
to
allow
them
to
others.
and
on
that,
here
again,
feeling
is
much
as
argument
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
that
i
suppose.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
an
argument
can
be
made
that
there
is
a
difference
in
quality
between
objections
which
in
the
broadest
base
are
religious
in
nature
having
some
connotation
with
the
unknown
with
the
unknown
with
what's
above
now
beyond
this.
on
the
one
hand
and
those
which
are
merely
intellectual,
merely
rational,
merely
internal
on
the
other.
that
is
an
argument
which
isn't
easy
for
me
to
verbalize
because
in
the
quicker
tradition
that
i'm
familiar
with,
it's
the
inner
voice
which
expresses
the
external
force.
but
so
that
i
can't
say
it's
just
a
question
whether
it's
external
or
internal.
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
it
relates
to
whether
it
deals
with
the
unknown
and
what
is
beyond
this
on
the
one
hand
and
what
the
man
out
of
his
own
intellectual
activity
rationalizes
to
a
conclusion
for
himself
and
my
position
on
that
would
be
that
that
is
a
classification
--
a
distinction
which
congress
has
made
for
a
175
years
which
was
well
understood
and
contemplated
at
the
time
the
amendment
was
adopted
that
it
would
not
be
a
construction
of
the
constitution
to
say
that
congress
can
not
do
it.
it
would
be
an
extension
of
it
beyond
anything
that
was
contemplated
either
at
its
drafting
or
in
a
century
and
a
half
since
then.
thank
you.
