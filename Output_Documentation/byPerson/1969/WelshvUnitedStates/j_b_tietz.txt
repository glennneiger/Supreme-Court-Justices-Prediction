mr.
j.
b.
tietz
mr.
chief
justice
and
gentlemen
of
the
court.
this
is
a
draft
prosecution
for
refusal
to
submit
to
induction
because
the
petitioner
didn't
get
the
conscientious
objector
classification.
everyone
concedes
that
he
was
truthful
and
sincere.
he
is
not
an
atheist
so
that
isn't
involved.
he
objects
to
all
wars,
so
that's
not
involved.
but
the
main
objection
of
the
government
is
that
his
religion
when
which
he
started
out
by
saying,
“i'm
nonreligious”
is
the
bone
of
contention.
before
we
get
to
the
first
amendment
point,
i
would
like
to
deal
with
the
two
threshold
matters
that
could
be
dispositive
of
the
case.
the
first
is
the
short
circuit,
the
corner
cutting
by
the
government
at
the
induction
proceedings.
i
have
briefed
i
think
as
adequately
as
i
can
one
point
raise
by
the
government
that
there
must
be
a
showing
of
prejudice.
i
rely
on
the
ninth
circuit
rational
in
welsh
and
in
rather
in
briggs
and
then
oshatz.
one
point
of
the
government
i
didn't
deal
with
adequately
in
the
briefing
is
that
the
government
argues
that
the
security
questionnaire
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
army.
now,
that's
the
same
argument
that
was
made
by
the
government
when
the
briggs
matter
of
not
getting
the
last
minute
cursory
inspection
came
up
is
the
same
argument
that
was
argued
by
the
government,
used
by
the
government
in
the
welsh
matter
when
he
didn't
get
tendered
to
him
the
security
questionnaire,
and
for
the
rational
in
there,
they
decided
that
it
was
required.
now,
the
same
thing
runs
through
the
thread
here.
there
is
one
point
though
that
it's
not
too
material
and
that
is,
of
the
government
keeps
saying
that
he
refuse.
actually,
he
didn't
refuse,
he
raised
the
question,
and
then,
the
best
reason
why
they
short
circuited
him
is
in
the
one
sentence
statement
of
the
government
rather
in
the
opinion
--
the
majority
opinion
below
that
district
judge
who
wrote
the
opinion
concurred
in
by
one
of
the
circuit
judges.
they
put
up
this
way
rather
than
delay
appellant's
induction
pending
investigation,
induction
station
personnel
ordered
him
to
step
forward.
that's
his
brief
description
of
the
short
circuit
as
possible.
now,
my
thought
is
this,
as
long
as
it's
a
part
of
the
army
regulation
that
no
man
shall
--
no
selectee
shall
be
inducted
when
he
either
qualifies
or
refuses
to
execute
the
oath
pending
a
thorough
investigation.
he's
entitled
to
that.
and
just
as
in
these
other
cases
i
mentioned,
that
was
held
to
have
sufficient
prejudice,
it
should
apply
here,
because
not
as
the
government
argues
that
he
can
--
by
that
avoid
induction
possibly
for
months
enforcing
the
military
to
waste
its
intelligence
resources,
all
the
government
has
to
do.
i
mean,
all
of
the
army
has
to
do
is
strike
out
a
few
words,
substitute
a
word
or
two
and
they
can
have
it
in
the
federal
register
in
two
or
three
dates.
now,
fortunately
for
the
security
of
a
country,
the
army
is
alert
and
when
it
sees
things
that
it
should
deal
with
it
does
fairly
prompt.
for
example,
when
i
get
back
in
the
practice
in
44,
about
the
first
man
in
the
office
was
yost.
he
was
on-leave
from
camp
roberts
where
he
said
he'd
been
forcibly
inducted.
he
testified
in
the
trial
court.
i
was
standing
with
a
great
many
other
men
who
had
passed
the
physical
examination
and
the
inducting
officer
came
over
and
said,
hold
up
your
right
hands
and
repeat
the
oath
after
me.
testified
as
one
jehovah's
witnesses,
i
couldn't
take
an
oath,
i
didn't
raise
my
right
hand,
i
said
nothing.
the
trial
judge
believed
and
granted
the
writ.
the
government
took
an
appeal.
but
before
an
en
banc
decision
affirming
the
appeal,
the
government
saw
the
light,
the
army
saw
the
light,
and
it
changed
the
induction
proceeding
crucial
point,
point
of
no
return
from
an
oath
to
a
stepping
forward.
now,
that
still
persist
to
this
day,
that's
the
way
it's
done
for
selectees
to
become
inductee.
ten
years
later
though,
the
army
--
i
had
to
consider
another
matter
and
that's
when
corrigan
came
in
the
office.
these
are
reported
appellate,
the
decisions
of
course
and
corrigan
says,
“i'm
in
the
stockade
at
the
fort
ord
and
i'm
here
because
i'm
trying
to
make
a
good
soldier
out
of
me.”
when
i
asked
him,
“how's
coming
if
you're
in
the
stockade
you're
here?”
he
testified,
we
were
seated
in
a
theater-like
arrangement.
i
was
in
the
back
row
when
we've
jumped
up
as
the
sergeant
told
us
to
do
and
the
officer
came
in.
the
officer
said,
“and
now,
when
i
call
a
name
of
each
of
you,
you'll
take
one
step
forward
and
that
step
is
in
the
army
of
the
united
states.”
he
said,
the
members
so
crowded
that
no
one
except
in
a
front
row
could
do
anything
but
shuffle
to
speak.
they
shuffled,
i
didn't
shuffle.
i
didn't
make
a
move.
the
trial
judge
decided
it
in
another
way
asking,
“when
did
you
make
up
your
mind
that
you're
a
conscientious
objector?”
he
said,
“while
i
was
standing
there.”
the
judge
set
us
too
late
and
i
couldn't
do
anything
about
it.
it's
never
too
late
to
face
civil
penalties
rather
than
go
into
the
military
service.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
unanimously,
reversed
on
the
basis
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
he'd
moved
to
state
board
and
i
think
that
one
thing
that
helped
them
to
reach
that
opinion
was
an
affidavit
that
i
filed
with
the
closing
brief
and
which
i
said,
“i've
gone
down
to
the
induction
station
and
i
see
that
they've
seen
the
light.”
they
now
have
a
different
procedure,
they
have
a
roll
of
chairs
around
three
sides
facing
the
podium
as
everybody
can
see
the
podium
and
they
have
a
white
line
painted
four
feet
from
the
wall.
so,
the
man
can
see
when
they
cross
the
--
when
they
cross
the
rubicon
or
any
of
expression
you
might
want.
so
that
the
army
learns
and
i
say
that
in
other
cases
for
example,
i
won't
belabor
it.
i'll
just
cite
one
more
reported
case
on
the
trial
level
ex
parte
barielle
(ph).
when
barielle
(ph)
secured
the
writ
down
in
san
diego,
the
record
which
we
got
from
the
selective
service
system
show
that
he
was
a
married
man
and
that
was
in
the
selective
services
system
records.
it
was
quite
a
bit
of
publicity.
it
is
stars
and
stripes
of
europe,
stars
and
stripes
of
the
orient
so
it
alarmed
the
army.
and
what
they
did,
they
got
the
selective
service
system
to
change
the
regulation
from
saying
that
a
husband
is
to
be
given
3-a
to
father
and
that's
the
way
it
is
today.
and
many
other
illustrations
can
be
given
at
the
selective
services
--
the
one
word
change.
i
don't
want
to
belabor
it
but
if
there's
any
question
about
that,
there
are
many
can
be
recited.
so,
i
say
that
as
long
as
it's
the
law,
i
think
that
government
agency
should
follow
its
own
regulations.
it
may
--
it
can
do
a
way
with
them
in
a
few
days.
now,
the
next
point
i
wish
to
go
in
to
is
also
one,
that
if
the
court
agrees
on
me
can
be
dispositive
of
a
case
and
that
is
the
point
that
which
if
he
had
been
before
this
court
some
years
ago
when
seeger
with
the
other
two
different
consolidated
for
the
oral
argument
for
decision
jacobson
and
peter.
i
say
he
would've
had
exactly
the
same
decision.
he
would've
been
held
to
have
a
parallel
brief
--
mr.
j.
b.
tietz
and
the
point
i
may
make
turn
back
now
is
that
he
has
exactly
the
same
situation
as
seeger
did.
he
qualifies
as
the
circuit
judge
hamley
put
it.
he
showed
there's
no
basis
in
fact
for
saying
that
he
didn't
have
a
parallel
equivalent
belief.
in
fact,
i
think
his
in
a
better
position
than
seeger
for
this
reason.
mr.
j.
b.
tietz
the
three
that
there's
a
constitutional
point,
that
there
is
a
security
questionnaire
point
and
that
the
man
meet
the
base
of
all
have
been
briefs
that
this
point
i'm
arguing
now
that
he
qualifies
has
been
briefed
thoroughly
and
curiously
enough.
it's
a
very
striking
thing.
the
government's
argument
that
it
doesn't
qualify
is
almost
word
for
word
certainly
follows
the
same
path
and
frequently
the
very
same
phraseology
that
the
government's
brief
in
seeger
because
the
government
very
conveniently
for
everybody
as
a
supplement
to
its
brief.
put
in
the
argument
portion
of
a
seeger
decision.
now,
page
2
(a)
and
3
(a)
of
the
supplement
are
showed
that
they
said
then
seeger
doesn't
meet
this
standard.
seeger
has
a
personal
moral
code
and
therefore
he
must
attack
the
constitutionality.
and
we
attack
it
as
a
matter
of
insurance
and
because
it's
involved
but,
i
think
that
when
you
run
a
parallel,
you'll
find
that
this
man,
it
was
from
the
early
childhood
to
about
15,
he
attended
the
presbyterian
sunday
school
then
he
attended
the
christian
science
sunday
school.
his
mother
was
a
christian
scientist
and
i
would
assert
though
i
don't
have
to
that
one
session
that
once
mother's
need
is
all
that
one
needs
for
training.
so,
he
had
the
training.
now,
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
in
a
words
of
the
dissenting
judge,
they
concede
that
he
have
the
strength
of
conviction,
the
strength
of
belief
that
he
just
doesn't
have
in
the
religious
background.
well,
he
has
as
much
religious
background
as
seeger
did.
seeger
and
he
did
almost
the
same
thing
with
the
form.
mr.
j.
b.
tietz
i
say
both
of
them,
but
i'm
arguing
now
the
former
for
this
reason.
that's
precisely
the
conclusion
that
circuit
judge
hamley
came
to
that
he
didn't.
although,
he
went
over
the
constitutional
questions
such
as
at
the
grave
one,
he
said
they
did
not
to
reach
it
because
he
does
comply.
that's
what
unfortunately
for
us.
the
circuit
judge
hamley
concluded
and
that
is
our
conclusion.
when
seeger
encountered
the
form,
he
struck
out
certain
words
and
put
quotation
marks
about
the
word
“religion.”
now,
i
take
that
to
mean
that
was
seeger
was
saying
if
you
want
to
call
what
i
believe
religious
unfortunately
the
court
did.
this
court
did.
let's
say
he
has
the
equivalent,
you
can
do
that
but
he
disavows
of
being
religious.
now,
welsh
did
more,
he
struck
out
the
word
“religious”
but
as
i
argued
in
the
briefing,
a
man
is
not
wholly
to
be
judged
by
what
he
says
and
especially
he
wrote
a
reply
to
the
attorney
general's
recommendation
to
the
appeal
board.
a
reply
that
he
was
permitted
to
encouraged,
invited
to
write
by
the
regulations
then
enforce
congress
has
done
a
way
with
that
now.
he
wrote
a
reply
which
as
the
circuit
judge
hamley
says
adequately
answered.
he
learned
from
the
seeger
decision
that
under
that
definition,
he
then
could
be
considered
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
laws.
so,
he
hasn't
made
i
think
from
that
standpoint.
now,
on
the
questions
of
the
constitutionality
that
of
course
is
one
which
i
argued
as
thoroughly
as
i
could,
i
pointed
out
the
four
or
five
decisions
of
this
court
which
as
i
interpret
and
say
not
only
may
not
congress
distinguish
between
religions
but
it
may
not
distinguish
between
religion,
any
religion
and
i
wish
to
save
a
few
minutes
of
my
time
for
possible
rebuttal.
mr.
j.
b.
tietz
it's
my
belief
that
seeger
definitely
decided
the
question
that
there
is
to
be
no
distinction
between
internally
derived
belief
and
external
derived
belief.
if
i'm
wrong
on
that,
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
present
then
seeger
might
be
modified,
but
i
don't
think
seeger
should
be
modified.
now,
whitmore
with
one
case
that
decided
that
case
turned
on
veracity.
he
wasn't
considerate
sincere
because
he
jumped
into
conflicting
plaint.
in
this
case,
everybody
considers
this
man
sincere
and
that
is
in
an
essence,
the
most
important
single
factor.
mr.
j.
b.
tietz
oh,
sorry.
and
that's
so
important
because
no
one
on
earth
knows
the
truth
except
the
man
himself
that
believe
him
but
we
don't
believe
him.
in
this
case,
everybody
believes
him.
they
merely
say
didn't
have
of
the
origin
of
his
beliefs.
now,
the
argument
has
been
made
historically
on
page
35
(a)
and
on
that
whole
history
helps
the
government
here
and
we've
made
very
little
effort
to
go
back
into
history
but
on
page
6
of
our
reply
brief,
we
pointed
out
that
madison
wrote
to
jefferson.
i'm
sure
that
the
rights
of
conscience
are
particular
and
so
on.
so,
that
the
concern
over
conscience
and
incidentally
there
was
little
statement
there
that
writes
a
conscience
based
on
religion.
i'm
not
saying
that
religion
may
not
be
the
best
source
of
conscience,
but
there
are
other
sources
of
course
for
conscience
too.
the
court
can
come
close
to
equating
conscience
and
religion,
and
to
many
people
now
was
stated
27
years
ago
by
judge
hand
in
the
kauten
case
that's
as
much
as
most
people
have
now.
maybe
the
pendulum
has
swing
the
other
way
but
that's
where
we
are.
now
a
question
was
asked
about
the
1-a-o
and
the
1-o
duties
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
a
rather
curious
picture
about
this
case
is
that
when
this
man
initially
presented
his
claim
he
was
classified
in
one
hill.
it's
only
as
his
beliefs
developed
that
he
claimed
the
1-o
and
then
other
than
procedure
was
send
on
for
the
big
investigation
inquiry
by
the
fbi
and
so
on.
and
the
result
depending
solely
on
the
interpretation
of
the
department
of
justice
and
his
recommendation
in
the
appeal
board
ended
him
up
without
even
the
1-a-o.
i'm
not
saying
that
was
very
wrong
but
i'm
saying
it's
interesting
that
they
thought
what
his
said
running
through.
now,
with
respect
to
the
selective
draft
cases,
it's
very
true
that
rothenberg
is
based
on
arver,
the
selective
draft
cases
but
that's
like
building
a
pyramid
up
by
my
shaky
point,
we've
attacked
that
in
our
brief
and
probably
as
much
as
we
could.
i
have
some
things
to
say
in
rebuttal
to
what
has
been
just
brought
out.
it's
the
best
statement
of
it,
more
concise
than
i
can
make
is
the
circuit
judge
hamley's
on
page
1091.
well,
just
disclaimer
of
a
religious
motivation
was
predicated
upon
the
misunderstanding
of
a
statutory
meeting
of
a
term
as
construed
in
seeger.
when
he
finally
realized
the
broad
reading
which
seeger
gave
to
that
term,
welsh
made
it
clear
that
he
did
have
a
religious
motivation.
so
all
the
government
has
said
in
his
brief
the
great
weight
must
be
given
to
what
the
petitioner
says.
his
last
statement
which
is
unrefuted
and
not
to
impugn
in
any
way
is
that
he
believes
not
only
strongly
in
what
his
always
believed
but
that
he
comes
within
the
statute.
mr.
j.
b.
tietz
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
j.
b.
tietz
oh,
the
cart
is
before
the
horse,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
b.
tietz
no,
no
and
that's
why
i
used
the
--
mr.
j.
b.
tietz
--
a
rather
crude
expression
that
cart
before
the
house.
judge
hamley
is
referring
to
the
record
that
was
before
that
court.
he's
referring
to
what
i
mentioned
before
that
provisions
of
the,
what
we
call
the
special
appellate
procedures
for
registrants
professing
conscientious
objector
and
provide
it
that
after
the
attorney
general
made
his
analysis
of
everything
and
his
recommendation
to
the
state
appeal
board.
the
registrant
is
to
be
permitted
to
file
a
rebuttal
if
he
doesn't
in
30
days
and
that
rebuttal
included
just
were
i
have
been
quoting
and
that
is
what
judge
hamley
was
referring
to.
that
was
all
in
the
record
before
the
trial
court
and
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
believe
that
when
this
is
all
read
it
will
be
seen
that
even
if
the
court
should
have
a
feeling
that
the
government
has
some
base
for
saying
we
didn't
raise
the
point
which
i
dispute
that
plain
error
exists
and
the
court
then
can
say,
this
man
is
the
same
as
seeger.
this
man
should
be
dealt
with
the
same
as
seeger.
now,
i'm
not
saying
that
i
give
up
the
constitutional
point
as
i
mentioned
before.
i
put
that
in
just
for
insurance,
it's
a
very
strong
insurance
and
it's
a
very
strong
case
as
judge
hamley
points
out.
he
says
he
don't
have
to
reach
it
but
he
went
into
it
quite
bit
of
detail.
he
pointed
out
that
the
everson
and
the
other
cases
support
the
point
we're
making
that
to
take
religion
as
against
non-religion
is
forbidden
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
j.
b.
tietz
mr.
chief
justice
and
gentlemen
of
the
court.
this
is
a
draft
prosecution
for
refusal
to
submit
to
induction
because
the
petitioner
didn't
get
the
conscientious
objector
classification.
everyone
concedes
that
he
was
truthful
and
sincere.
he
is
not
an
atheist
so
that
isn't
involved.
he
objects
to
all
wars,
so
that's
not
involved.
but
the
main
objection
of
the
government
is
that
his
religion
when
which
he
started
out
by
saying,
“i'm
nonreligious”
is
the
bone
of
contention.
before
we
get
to
the
first
amendment
point,
i
would
like
to
deal
with
the
two
threshold
matters
that
could
be
dispositive
of
the
case.
the
first
is
the
short
circuit,
the
corner
cutting
by
the
government
at
the
induction
proceedings.
i
have
briefed
i
think
as
adequately
as
i
can
one
point
raise
by
the
government
that
there
must
be
a
showing
of
prejudice.
i
rely
on
the
ninth
circuit
rational
in
welsh
and
in
rather
in
briggs
and
then
oshatz.
one
point
of
the
government
i
didn't
deal
with
adequately
in
the
briefing
is
that
the
government
argues
that
the
security
questionnaire
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
army.
now,
that's
the
same
argument
that
was
made
by
the
government
when
the
briggs
matter
of
not
getting
the
last
minute
cursory
inspection
came
up
is
the
same
argument
that
was
argued
by
the
government,
used
by
the
government
in
the
welsh
matter
when
he
didn't
get
tendered
to
him
the
security
questionnaire,
and
for
the
rational
in
there,
they
decided
that
it
was
required.
now,
the
same
thing
runs
through
the
thread
here.
there
is
one
point
though
that
it's
not
too
material
and
that
is,
of
the
government
keeps
saying
that
he
refuse.
actually,
he
didn't
refuse,
he
raised
the
question,
and
then,
the
best
reason
why
they
short
circuited
him
is
in
the
one
sentence
statement
of
the
government
rather
in
the
opinion
--
the
majority
opinion
below
that
district
judge
who
wrote
the
opinion
concurred
in
by
one
of
the
circuit
judges.
they
put
up
this
way
rather
than
delay
appellant's
induction
pending
investigation,
induction
station
personnel
ordered
him
to
step
forward.
that's
his
brief
description
of
the
short
circuit
as
possible.
now,
my
thought
is
this,
as
long
as
it's
a
part
of
the
army
regulation
that
no
man
shall
--
no
selectee
shall
be
inducted
when
he
either
qualifies
or
refuses
to
execute
the
oath
pending
a
thorough
investigation.
he's
entitled
to
that.
and
just
as
in
these
other
cases
i
mentioned,
that
was
held
to
have
sufficient
prejudice,
it
should
apply
here,
because
not
as
the
government
argues
that
he
can
--
by
that
avoid
induction
possibly
for
months
enforcing
the
military
to
waste
its
intelligence
resources,
all
the
government
has
to
do.
i
mean,
all
of
the
army
has
to
do
is
strike
out
a
few
words,
substitute
a
word
or
two
and
they
can
have
it
in
the
federal
register
in
two
or
three
dates.
now,
fortunately
for
the
security
of
a
country,
the
army
is
alert
and
when
it
sees
things
that
it
should
deal
with
it
does
fairly
prompt.
for
example,
when
i
get
back
in
the
practice
in
44,
about
the
first
man
in
the
office
was
yost.
he
was
on-leave
from
camp
roberts
where
he
said
he'd
been
forcibly
inducted.
he
testified
in
the
trial
court.
i
was
standing
with
a
great
many
other
men
who
had
passed
the
physical
examination
and
the
inducting
officer
came
over
and
said,
hold
up
your
right
hands
and
repeat
the
oath
after
me.
testified
as
one
jehovah's
witnesses,
i
couldn't
take
an
oath,
i
didn't
raise
my
right
hand,
i
said
nothing.
the
trial
judge
believed
and
granted
the
writ.
the
government
took
an
appeal.
but
before
an
en
banc
decision
affirming
the
appeal,
the
government
saw
the
light,
the
army
saw
the
light,
and
it
changed
the
induction
proceeding
crucial
point,
point
of
no
return
from
an
oath
to
a
stepping
forward.
now,
that
still
persist
to
this
day,
that's
the
way
it's
done
for
selectees
to
become
inductee.
ten
years
later
though,
the
army
--
i
had
to
consider
another
matter
and
that's
when
corrigan
came
in
the
office.
these
are
reported
appellate,
the
decisions
of
course
and
corrigan
says,
“i'm
in
the
stockade
at
the
fort
ord
and
i'm
here
because
i'm
trying
to
make
a
good
soldier
out
of
me.”
when
i
asked
him,
“how's
coming
if
you're
in
the
stockade
you're
here?”
he
testified,
we
were
seated
in
a
theater-like
arrangement.
i
was
in
the
back
row
when
we've
jumped
up
as
the
sergeant
told
us
to
do
and
the
officer
came
in.
the
officer
said,
“and
now,
when
i
call
a
name
of
each
of
you,
you'll
take
one
step
forward
and
that
step
is
in
the
army
of
the
united
states.”
he
said,
the
members
so
crowded
that
no
one
except
in
a
front
row
could
do
anything
but
shuffle
to
speak.
they
shuffled,
i
didn't
shuffle.
i
didn't
make
a
move.
the
trial
judge
decided
it
in
another
way
asking,
“when
did
you
make
up
your
mind
that
you're
a
conscientious
objector?”
he
said,
“while
i
was
standing
there.”
the
judge
set
us
too
late
and
i
couldn't
do
anything
about
it.
it's
never
too
late
to
face
civil
penalties
rather
than
go
into
the
military
service.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
unanimously,
reversed
on
the
basis
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
he'd
moved
to
state
board
and
i
think
that
one
thing
that
helped
them
to
reach
that
opinion
was
an
affidavit
that
i
filed
with
the
closing
brief
and
which
i
said,
“i've
gone
down
to
the
induction
station
and
i
see
that
they've
seen
the
light.”
they
now
have
a
different
procedure,
they
have
a
roll
of
chairs
around
three
sides
facing
the
podium
as
everybody
can
see
the
podium
and
they
have
a
white
line
painted
four
feet
from
the
wall.
so,
the
man
can
see
when
they
cross
the
--
when
they
cross
the
rubicon
or
any
of
expression
you
might
want.
so
that
the
army
learns
and
i
say
that
in
other
cases
for
example,
i
won't
belabor
it.
i'll
just
cite
one
more
reported
case
on
the
trial
level
ex
parte
barielle
(ph).
when
barielle
(ph)
secured
the
writ
down
in
san
diego,
the
record
which
we
got
from
the
selective
service
system
show
that
he
was
a
married
man
and
that
was
in
the
selective
services
system
records.
it
was
quite
a
bit
of
publicity.
it
is
stars
and
stripes
of
europe,
stars
and
stripes
of
the
orient
so
it
alarmed
the
army.
and
what
they
did,
they
got
the
selective
service
system
to
change
the
regulation
from
saying
that
a
husband
is
to
be
given
3-a
to
father
and
that's
the
way
it
is
today.
and
many
other
illustrations
can
be
given
at
the
selective
services
--
the
one
word
change.
i
don't
want
to
belabor
it
but
if
there's
any
question
about
that,
there
are
many
can
be
recited.
so,
i
say
that
as
long
as
it's
the
law,
i
think
that
government
agency
should
follow
its
own
regulations.
it
may
--
it
can
do
a
way
with
them
in
a
few
days.
now,
the
next
point
i
wish
to
go
in
to
is
also
one,
that
if
the
court
agrees
on
me
can
be
dispositive
of
a
case
and
that
is
the
point
that
which
if
he
had
been
before
this
court
some
years
ago
when
seeger
with
the
other
two
different
consolidated
for
the
oral
argument
for
decision
jacobson
and
peter.
i
say
he
would've
had
exactly
the
same
decision.
he
would've
been
held
to
have
a
parallel
brief
--
mr.
j.
b.
tietz
and
the
point
i
may
make
turn
back
now
is
that
he
has
exactly
the
same
situation
as
seeger
did.
he
qualifies
as
the
circuit
judge
hamley
put
it.
he
showed
there's
no
basis
in
fact
for
saying
that
he
didn't
have
a
parallel
equivalent
belief.
in
fact,
i
think
his
in
a
better
position
than
seeger
for
this
reason.
mr.
j.
b.
tietz
the
three
that
there's
a
constitutional
point,
that
there
is
a
security
questionnaire
point
and
that
the
man
meet
the
base
of
all
have
been
briefs
that
this
point
i'm
arguing
now
that
he
qualifies
has
been
briefed
thoroughly
and
curiously
enough.
it's
a
very
striking
thing.
the
government's
argument
that
it
doesn't
qualify
is
almost
word
for
word
certainly
follows
the
same
path
and
frequently
the
very
same
phraseology
that
the
government's
brief
in
seeger
because
the
government
very
conveniently
for
everybody
as
a
supplement
to
its
brief.
put
in
the
argument
portion
of
a
seeger
decision.
now,
page
2
(a)
and
3
(a)
of
the
supplement
are
showed
that
they
said
then
seeger
doesn't
meet
this
standard.
seeger
has
a
personal
moral
code
and
therefore
he
must
attack
the
constitutionality.
and
we
attack
it
as
a
matter
of
insurance
and
because
it's
involved
but,
i
think
that
when
you
run
a
parallel,
you'll
find
that
this
man,
it
was
from
the
early
childhood
to
about
15,
he
attended
the
presbyterian
sunday
school
then
he
attended
the
christian
science
sunday
school.
his
mother
was
a
christian
scientist
and
i
would
assert
though
i
don't
have
to
that
one
session
that
once
mother's
need
is
all
that
one
needs
for
training.
so,
he
had
the
training.
now,
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
in
a
words
of
the
dissenting
judge,
they
concede
that
he
have
the
strength
of
conviction,
the
strength
of
belief
that
he
just
doesn't
have
in
the
religious
background.
well,
he
has
as
much
religious
background
as
seeger
did.
seeger
and
he
did
almost
the
same
thing
with
the
form.
mr.
j.
b.
tietz
i
say
both
of
them,
but
i'm
arguing
now
the
former
for
this
reason.
that's
precisely
the
conclusion
that
circuit
judge
hamley
came
to
that
he
didn't.
although,
he
went
over
the
constitutional
questions
such
as
at
the
grave
one,
he
said
they
did
not
to
reach
it
because
he
does
comply.
that's
what
unfortunately
for
us.
the
circuit
judge
hamley
concluded
and
that
is
our
conclusion.
when
seeger
encountered
the
form,
he
struck
out
certain
words
and
put
quotation
marks
about
the
word
“religion.”
now,
i
take
that
to
mean
that
was
seeger
was
saying
if
you
want
to
call
what
i
believe
religious
unfortunately
the
court
did.
this
court
did.
let's
say
he
has
the
equivalent,
you
can
do
that
but
he
disavows
of
being
religious.
now,
welsh
did
more,
he
struck
out
the
word
“religious”
but
as
i
argued
in
the
briefing,
a
man
is
not
wholly
to
be
judged
by
what
he
says
and
especially
he
wrote
a
reply
to
the
attorney
general's
recommendation
to
the
appeal
board.
a
reply
that
he
was
permitted
to
encouraged,
invited
to
write
by
the
regulations
then
enforce
congress
has
done
a
way
with
that
now.
he
wrote
a
reply
which
as
the
circuit
judge
hamley
says
adequately
answered.
he
learned
from
the
seeger
decision
that
under
that
definition,
he
then
could
be
considered
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
laws.
so,
he
hasn't
made
i
think
from
that
standpoint.
now,
on
the
questions
of
the
constitutionality
that
of
course
is
one
which
i
argued
as
thoroughly
as
i
could,
i
pointed
out
the
four
or
five
decisions
of
this
court
which
as
i
interpret
and
say
not
only
may
not
congress
distinguish
between
religions
but
it
may
not
distinguish
between
religion,
any
religion
and
i
wish
to
save
a
few
minutes
of
my
time
for
possible
rebuttal.
mr.
j.
b.
tietz
it's
my
belief
that
seeger
definitely
decided
the
question
that
there
is
to
be
no
distinction
between
internally
derived
belief
and
external
derived
belief.
if
i'm
wrong
on
that,
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
present
then
seeger
might
be
modified,
but
i
don't
think
seeger
should
be
modified.
now,
whitmore
with
one
case
that
decided
that
case
turned
on
veracity.
he
wasn't
considerate
sincere
because
he
jumped
into
conflicting
plaint.
in
this
case,
everybody
considers
this
man
sincere
and
that
is
in
an
essence,
the
most
important
single
factor.
mr.
j.
b.
tietz
oh,
sorry.
and
that's
so
important
because
no
one
on
earth
knows
the
truth
except
the
man
himself
that
believe
him
but
we
don't
believe
him.
in
this
case,
everybody
believes
him.
they
merely
say
didn't
have
of
the
origin
of
his
beliefs.
now,
the
argument
has
been
made
historically
on
page
35
(a)
and
on
that
whole
history
helps
the
government
here
and
we've
made
very
little
effort
to
go
back
into
history
but
on
page
6
of
our
reply
brief,
we
pointed
out
that
madison
wrote
to
jefferson.
i'm
sure
that
the
rights
of
conscience
are
particular
and
so
on.
so,
that
the
concern
over
conscience
and
incidentally
there
was
little
statement
there
that
writes
a
conscience
based
on
religion.
i'm
not
saying
that
religion
may
not
be
the
best
source
of
conscience,
but
there
are
other
sources
of
course
for
conscience
too.
the
court
can
come
close
to
equating
conscience
and
religion,
and
to
many
people
now
was
stated
27
years
ago
by
judge
hand
in
the
kauten
case
that's
as
much
as
most
people
have
now.
maybe
the
pendulum
has
swing
the
other
way
but
that's
where
we
are.
now
a
question
was
asked
about
the
1-a-o
and
the
1-o
duties
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
a
rather
curious
picture
about
this
case
is
that
when
this
man
initially
presented
his
claim
he
was
classified
in
one
hill.
it's
only
as
his
beliefs
developed
that
he
claimed
the
1-o
and
then
other
than
procedure
was
send
on
for
the
big
investigation
inquiry
by
the
fbi
and
so
on.
and
the
result
depending
solely
on
the
interpretation
of
the
department
of
justice
and
his
recommendation
in
the
appeal
board
ended
him
up
without
even
the
1-a-o.
i'm
not
saying
that
was
very
wrong
but
i'm
saying
it's
interesting
that
they
thought
what
his
said
running
through.
now,
with
respect
to
the
selective
draft
cases,
it's
very
true
that
rothenberg
is
based
on
arver,
the
selective
draft
cases
but
that's
like
building
a
pyramid
up
by
my
shaky
point,
we've
attacked
that
in
our
brief
and
probably
as
much
as
we
could.
i
have
some
things
to
say
in
rebuttal
to
what
has
been
just
brought
out.
it's
the
best
statement
of
it,
more
concise
than
i
can
make
is
the
circuit
judge
hamley's
on
page
1091.
well,
just
disclaimer
of
a
religious
motivation
was
predicated
upon
the
misunderstanding
of
a
statutory
meeting
of
a
term
as
construed
in
seeger.
when
he
finally
realized
the
broad
reading
which
seeger
gave
to
that
term,
welsh
made
it
clear
that
he
did
have
a
religious
motivation.
so
all
the
government
has
said
in
his
brief
the
great
weight
must
be
given
to
what
the
petitioner
says.
his
last
statement
which
is
unrefuted
and
not
to
impugn
in
any
way
is
that
he
believes
not
only
strongly
in
what
his
always
believed
but
that
he
comes
within
the
statute.
mr.
j.
b.
tietz
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
j.
b.
tietz
oh,
the
cart
is
before
the
horse,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
b.
tietz
no,
no
and
that's
why
i
used
the
--
mr.
j.
b.
tietz
--
a
rather
crude
expression
that
cart
before
the
house.
judge
hamley
is
referring
to
the
record
that
was
before
that
court.
he's
referring
to
what
i
mentioned
before
that
provisions
of
the,
what
we
call
the
special
appellate
procedures
for
registrants
professing
conscientious
objector
and
provide
it
that
after
the
attorney
general
made
his
analysis
of
everything
and
his
recommendation
to
the
state
appeal
board.
the
registrant
is
to
be
permitted
to
file
a
rebuttal
if
he
doesn't
in
30
days
and
that
rebuttal
included
just
were
i
have
been
quoting
and
that
is
what
judge
hamley
was
referring
to.
that
was
all
in
the
record
before
the
trial
court
and
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
believe
that
when
this
is
all
read
it
will
be
seen
that
even
if
the
court
should
have
a
feeling
that
the
government
has
some
base
for
saying
we
didn't
raise
the
point
which
i
dispute
that
plain
error
exists
and
the
court
then
can
say,
this
man
is
the
same
as
seeger.
this
man
should
be
dealt
with
the
same
as
seeger.
now,
i'm
not
saying
that
i
give
up
the
constitutional
point
as
i
mentioned
before.
i
put
that
in
just
for
insurance,
it's
a
very
strong
insurance
and
it's
a
very
strong
case
as
judge
hamley
points
out.
he
says
he
don't
have
to
reach
it
but
he
went
into
it
quite
bit
of
detail.
he
pointed
out
that
the
everson
and
the
other
cases
support
the
point
we're
making
that
to
take
religion
as
against
non-religion
is
forbidden
by
the
first
amendment.
