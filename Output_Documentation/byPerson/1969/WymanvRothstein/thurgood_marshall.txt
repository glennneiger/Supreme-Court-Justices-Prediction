what
happens
if
the
people
living
in
the
ghettos
in
westchester
county
and
nassau
county,
and
believe
me
there’s
some
ghettos
out
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
need
a
gauge
too,
don’t
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
why
not
throw
new
york
city
and
then
draw
the
line?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
the
crime
rate
in
new
york
higher
than
buffalo?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
find
that
it
works?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
lower
in
westchester?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
nassau?
justice
thurgood
marshall
those
are
the
two
counties
that
are
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
what
you
take,
the
state
of
new
york
takes
position
that
you
can’t
defend
this
across
the
board
but
you
had
throw
all
these
little
components
in
and
they
slide
in
this
way.
you
mentioned
razorblades
where
i
assume
that
a
hippie
doesn’t
need
one.
[laughter]
i
mean
i
just
don’t
see
new
york’s
position
except
that
for
some
reason
unclear
to
me,
new
york
city
was
set
aside
from
the
surrounding
area,
nassau
and
westchester
county?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
subways,
they
have
elaborate
bus
systems
in
those
counties
and
i
would
assume
the
bus
fare
is
as
high
as
the
subway
fair,
i
would
assume?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
it’s
different?
justice
thurgood
marshall

about
the

justice
thurgood

how
about
the

westchester?
