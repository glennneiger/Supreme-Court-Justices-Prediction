number
896,
wyman
against
rothstein.
mr.
weinberg,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
you're
speaking
now
of
the
bill
which
established
a
differential
to
recognize
the
higher
cost
of
living
in
new
york
city?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
at
least
does
the
questions
still
remain
as
it
was
before
whether
this
is
a
reasonable
classification
on
the
part
of
the
commissioner?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
change
because
you
have
fewer
possible
cases.
but
the
fundamental
question
hasn't
change
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
claim
that
on
this
record,
you
have
shown
that
there's
a
valid
basis
for
a
difference
in
the
cost
of
living
in
the
two
places?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
telling
us
in
the
whole
frame
of
work.
you're
argument
that
--
if
you
have
that
opportunity,
you
can't
show
anymore
objective
evidence
than
the
record
has
already
made.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright,
mr.
weinberg.
mr.
sparer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
to
pursue
justice
black's
question,
do
you
think
that
these
factors
taken
as
a
whole
are
susceptible
of
the
precise
mathematical
proof?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
are
your
telling
me
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
that
you're
saying
then
in
effect
that
it
is
inevitably
the
same?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
they
all
agree?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
all
agree?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
going
to
supply
that
to
us
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
not
quite.
not
quite
--
not
quite
mr.
counsel.
you
said
that
as
i
understood
then
that
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
overlap?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
between
new
york
city
if
now
immediately
by
whatever
administrative
process
is
necessary.
if
new
york
city
cut
back
to
the
level
of
these
other
areas
then
you
wouldn't
be
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
mean
they
have
to
make
the
new
objective
findings
or
couldn't
they
just
take
your
brief
and
say
well
we,
we
surrender
and
we
cut
new
york
city
back?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
do
you
think
it's
a
denial
of
equal
protection
to
give
more
people
of
the
--
more
rent
to
the
urban
and
to
the
suburban
people
and
the
urban
people?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
question
is
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
telling
you
the
way
it
is.
i
was
taking
your
statement
facts.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
understand
about
this
matter
that
its
argument.
but
let's
just
stay
on
the
rent
for
a
moment.
do
you
think
there's
rational
basis
for
a
differential
in
the
rent
allowance
in
new
york
city
under
their
places?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
did
they
--
it
is
anymore
precise
than
the
differences
that
the
commissioner
is
relying
on
than
the
other
areas?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
both
the
state
of
new
york
legislature
made
a
legislative
judgment
that
helped
relieve
the
congestion
in
the
cities
that
they
would
have
equal
rates
all
over
state.
the
same
in
poughkeepsie
and
whatever
your
northernmost
towns
are,
the
small
towns
as
in
new
york
city
eventhough
they
acknowledge
the
differential
in
costs.
but
they
did
this
deliberately
to
get
people
to
move
out
of
the
cities
and
as
a
matter
of
public
policy.
do
you
think
that
would
be
permissible?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
strauss,
you
can
get
underway
for
a
little
while
today.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
better
defer
till
morning
on
that
mr.
strauss.
i
think
we'll
suspend
for
the
day
to
take
you
more
time
when
we
have
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
arguments
in
number
896
wyman
against
rothstein.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
strauss,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
succeed
on
the
constitutional
issue
or
on
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
your
argument
really
comes
down
to
the
fact
that
there’s
been
a
mistaken
judgment
here,
a
legislative
judgment
any/or
an
administrative
misjudgment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
strauss.
mr.
weinberg
you
have
13
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
new
york
had
any
conformity
proceedings
in
the
past
in
this
area
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
mean
the
enforcement
process
by
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
they
in
any
other
states
to
your
knowledge?
do
you
any
information
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there
is
a
complete
procedure
or
a
procedure
provided
by
congress
to
achieve
conformity
by
a
state
as
a
condition
to
getting
the
federal
grants,
isn’t
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
got
a
district
court
with
a
different
view
of
the
matter
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
your
view
that
congress
intended
the
confirmaty
proceedings
as
the
primary
method
of
resolving
the
differences
in
standards
between
the
states
in
the
federal
government?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
would
be
in
a
district
court
proceeding,
would
it,
a
single-judge
district
court,
a
regular
evidentiary
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
it
would
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
come
here
possibly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
instead
of
coming
in
one
leap
from
a
three-judge
court
to
this
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
weinberg.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
not?
mr.
strauss.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
number
896,
