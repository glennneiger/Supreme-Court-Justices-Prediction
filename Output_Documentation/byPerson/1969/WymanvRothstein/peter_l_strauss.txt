mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
gather
we
will
be
going
over
until
tomorrow
and
so
for
now,
i
just
want
to
say
a
few
things
rather
briefly
to
get
down
what
seem
to
me,
seem
to
the
united
states
to
be
the
central
features
of
this
case.
first,
i
think
it
is
by
now
clear
that
the
only
issue
in
this
case
is
a
preliminary
injunction.
a
preliminary
injunction
whose
effect
i
think
has
been
dramatically
over
characterized
by
appellants
here.
it
is
not
a
requirement
to
the
state
to
appropriate
funds.
it
is
not
an
injunction
to
the
state
to
pay
the
injunction
tells
the
state
of
new
york
strictly
in
the
terms
of
mr.
justice
harlan's
opinion
for
the
court
in
rosado.
if
the
state
wishes
to
continue
receiving
federal
funds
then
it
must
order
its
need
standard
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
done
on
an
objective
rational
basis
which
are
submission
is
the
requirement
of
federal
law
and
no
more.
second,
i
think
again
to
clear
out
the
point
which
has
been
raised
here.
it
is
fundamentally
our
belief
and
i
will
put
it
in
probability
terms
which
are
all
that
are
required
here
on
preliminary
injunction
that
the
appellants
have
shown
that
in
all
probability
new
york
state
is
applying
two
different
standards
of
need.
one
for
new
york
city
which
includes
the
social
class
of
living
in
a
city,
in
transportation,
in
visits
to
museums,
in
beaches,
and
possibly
laundry
costs
and
a
lot
of
costs,
and
a
number
other
items
and
another
standard
of
need
for
the
rest
of
the
state
in
which
residents
and
the
rest
of
the
state
cannot
obtain
those
item
or
i
should
put
it
more
correctly
because
welfare
recipients
may
spend
the
money
they
received,
however
they
wish
have
no
allowance
for
those
items
no
matter
how
badly
they
may
need
them
even
if
they
live
in
ghetto
and
yonkers
or
in
buffalo.
there
simple
is
no
allowance
for
them
for
these
items.
and
it
is
the
position
of
hew
that
the
standard
of
need
is
a
standard
of
services.
not
a
standard
of
money
necessarily
and
that
the
obligation
of
the
state
is
to
determine
for
itself
and
they
have
great
latitude
in
doing
so.
what
services
are
required
it
is
a
minimum
for
living
in
that
state.
when
they
determine
what
services
are
required
then
they
may
cost
those
services
and
they
may
do
so
as
mr.
sparer
has
just
suggested
on
one
of
two
bases.
and
they
do
so
throughout
the
state
taking
an
average
of
those
costs
throughout
the
state
or
they
may
do
so
on
a
regional
basis.
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
average
expense
for
knox
in
new
york
is
considerably
greater
than
the
average
expense
in
buffalo
or
certainly
than
the
average
expense
in
malone.
and
the
state
would
be
entitled
to
take
that
into
account
and
deciding
how
much
to
pay
on
those
regions.
but
it
must
make
provision
that
if
it's
going
to
provide
that
these
things
are
available
it
must
make
provision
for
their
availability
on
a
statewide
basis.
and
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
really
provides
the
answer
to
your
rent
question.
new
york
has
made
the
judgment.
i
for
myself
would
think
it's
a
wise
judgment
although
not
necessary
one
that
the
costs
of
rent
are
so
variable
in
different
parts
of
the
state
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
treat
them
as
on
average.
and
therefore,
they
treat
them
on
an
individual
basis.
but
in
terms
of
the
standard
of
need,
what's
important
is
that
everyone
in
new
york
state
has
the
right
to
rent.
but
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
live
in
buffalo
or
new
york
city
or
on
nassau
county.
you
have
the
right
to
rent.
you
could
have
it
on
average
basis.
you
could
have
it
on
individual
cost
basis
but
you
have
the
right
to
that
service.
what
new
york
city
is
doing
on
this
case,
we
submit
is
to
say
that
only
people
who
live
in
new
york
city
have
the
right
to
go
to
the
beach.
and
only
people
who
live
on
new
york
city
have
the
right
to
an
allowance
for
transportation
and
only
people
who
live
in
new
york
city
have
the
right
to
an
allowance
that
might
provide
them
some
security
or
repair
their
dilapidated
premises.
those
are
the
only
rationales
we've
heard
and
those
rationales
do
not
meet
federal
requirement
in
uniformity.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no.
i
think
--
i
think
a
--
i
think
the
court
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
the
court
might
but
all
that's
necessary
is
to
affirm
the
preliminary
injunction
and
leave
the
further
proceedings
below.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
we
have.
i
think
one
of
--
i
think
one
of
the
features
that
the
court
might
wish
to
have
in
mind
in
deciding
what
to
do
is
that
there
is
this
new
statute
that
commissioner
wyman
is
under
very
explicit
instructions
from
the
state
of
new
york
about
meeting
the
federal
standards.
he
--
he
knows
there
can
be
no
question
what
our
position
is
now.
let
me
read
you
this.
this
is
from
section
1,
the
enacting
part
of
this
new
statute
of
april
16th.
the
legislature
hereby
and
declares
its
intent
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
sure.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
--
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
i
believe
i
was
asked
at
the
close
of
the
session
about
remand,
ought
there
to
be
a
remand,
ought
this
court
finally
to
pass
on
the
statutory
issue
here.
i
think
i
should
say,
i
think
there
would
be
a
substantial
point
in
remanding
it,
there’s
no
need
to
pass
on
the
statutory
issue
finally.
and
this
is
a
preliminary
injunction.
all
that’s
necessary
is
that
the
court
be
convinced
that
the
appellees
probably
will
succeed
upon
their
cause
of
action
in
the
court
below.
and
as
i
was
starting
to
say,
the
state
of
new
york
in
this
most
recently
enacted
statute,
of
which
i
believe
the
court
has
copies,
has
made
some
policy
judgments
which
i
think
go
to
the
heart
of
some
of
the
doubts.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
sure.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
i
should
think
not.
to
affirm
the
preliminary
injunction,
but
on
the
basis
that
appellees
had
shown
that
they
probably
would
succeed
that
there
was
no
abuse
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
on
the
statute,
i
think
this
court
can
pass
on
that
issue
here.
it
remarked
with
some
strength
in
footnote
in
the
dandridge
case
regarding
the
right
of
appellees
to
put
forward
any
ground
that
would
support
the
judgment
which
they
received
below.
it
remarked
with
some
strength
in
rosado,
that
statutory
issue
should
be
reached
before
constitutional
issues
and
i
think
on
those
basis
that
this
court
would
have
no
difficulty
reaching
the
statutory
issue
and
making
the
judgment
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
which
new
york
has
i
think
conceded.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
that
was
left
open
in
rosado.
i
think
the
situation
in
this
court
in
rosado
however
was
that
the
petitioners
there
had
relief
before
this
court.
here
petitioners
come
into
this
court,
relief
having
been
granted.
we
take
the
position
that
that
relief
is
no
more
than
an
order
of
compliance
with
the
federal
standard
which
in
our
view
new
york
is
in
any
event
obligated
to
comply.
we
believe
that
petitioners
have
made
the
showing,
a
sufficient
showing
that
new
york
is
out
of
compliance
with
that
standard
to
justify
such
an
order.
it
leaves
free
to
new
york
the
choice
which
this
court
said
new
york
must
have
in
rosado,
that
is
the
choice
of
withdrawing
entirely
from
the
federal
program.
and
then
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
them
the
basis
of
the
statute
is
that
new
york
has
in
fact
made
that
choice.
in
the
statute
the
legislature
said
and
i’m
quoting
at
line
nine
of
the
first
page,
if
you
have
it
there,
“the
legislature
hereby
declares
its
intent
to
make
provision
for
the
state
to
meet
all
necessary
federal
requirements
under
the
social
security
act.
and
again
at
line
three,
“it
is
the
intent
of
the
legislature
that
the
department
of
social
services
shall
determine
and
establish
the
standards
of
need
for
public
assistance
in
this
state
in
conformity
with
federal
requirements.”
and
again,
within
the
adopted
amended
section
131
(a)
itself
on
page
4
at
line
twelve,
“if
federal
requirements
make
it
necessary
to
adjust
any
schedule
of
grants
and
allowances
or
part
thereof,
the
department
shall
make
such
adjustments.”
so
that
i
think
new
york’s
judgment
in
this
case
is
entirely
clear
and
as
we
set
out
in
the
rather
long
footnote
of
the
end
of
our
amicus
brief,
is
the
judgment
in
which
all
states
of
the
union
have
essentially
concurred.
and
there
was
also
the
question
yesterday
and
i
think
this
goes
back
to
what
i
was
trying
to
say
during
the
short
time
i
had
then,
“why
was
the
government
had
put
as
part
of
its
question
presented,
whether
the
new
york
state
plan
improperly
favors
residents
of
new
york
city
over
residents
of
other
areas
of
the
state,”
and
this
goes
i
think
to
the
heart
of
the
issue.
the
impropriety
is
not
in
itself
in
the
payment
of
more
money
in
new
york
city
than
new
york
state,
but
as
i
was
trying
to
state
yesterday
in
considering
that
residents
of
new
york
state
need
services,
need
goods,
need
items
which
are
not
under
any
circumstances
made
available
to
residents
of
any
other
part
of
the
state
even
though
their
need
for
those
items
might
equally
be
made
the
same.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
directly
inconsistent
with
the
statute,
with
the
provision
of
the
statute
which
in
both
cases,
section
602
(a)
and
section
1382
(a)
provides
that
a
state
plan
for
aid
and
services
must
provide
that
it
shall
be
in
effect
in
all
political
subdivisions
of
the
state
and
if
administered
by
the
subdivisions
must
be
mandatory
upon
them.
and
it
has
been
since
the
beginning
of
the
act
to
the
departments
understanding
and
interpretation
that
that
means
that
you
cannot
say
within
a
state
the
people
in
part
of
the
state
are
entitled
to
goods
and
services,
i’m
not
talking
about
amounts
of
money
at
this
point,
entitled
the
goods
and
services
to
accounting
for
those
goods
and
services
which
people
in
another
part
of
the
state
simply
have
no
access
too.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
i
think
that’s
right
mr.
justice
stewart.
in
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
it’s
correct
that
it
doesn’t
exist
in
redwood
or
alexandria
bay,
but
i
don’t
think
it
can
be
said
on
the
basis
of
this
record
that
that
need
doesn’t
exist
in
nassau
county
or
in
westchester
county
which
are
crowded,
congested
areas,
where
necessary
services
and
jobs
may
also
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
suppose
it
comes
down
to
how
particular
judgment
you
were
to
make.
as
i
understand
the
new
york
standard
of
need,
the
list
of
basic
needs
which
new
york
state
recognizes
claims
to
recognize
in
its
standard
of
need
doesn’t
include
any
allowance
for
transportation,
that
is
at
page
47
of
the
appendix,
food,
clothing,
personal
incidentals,
household
supplies,
school
expenses,
utilities,
laundries
and
sales
taxes.
now,
it
is
certainly
our
position
that
new
york
state
could
if
it
felt
it
was
necessary
to
the
residents
of
that
state
make
provision
for
transportation
expenses
to
take
your
example.
and
it
could
do
so
either
on
a
basic
need
basis,
or
on
a
special
need
basis,
i
think
the
court
is
familiar
with
that
difference
from
rosado.
if
it
does
on
a
basic
needs
basis,
that
means
that
the
cost
is
to
be
figured
in
to
the
flat
ground
for
every
resident
of
the
state.
in
figuring
that
cost,
the
state
has
the
option
of
doing
it
on
an
average
basis
or
doing
it
on
a
local
regional
basis,
and
if
they
did
it
on
a
local
regional
basis,
i
would
certainly
agree
that
the
amount
for
new
york
city
would
quite
possibly
be
higher
than
the
amount
for
other
parts
of
the
state.
from
the
evidence
of
the
record
it
might
also
be
lower
than
let’s
say
nassau
county.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
it’s
more
than
that
mr.
chief
justice.
we
are
talking
here
not
about
or
at
least
i
am
talking
here,
not
about
the
equal
protection
clause
with
the
judgments
of
rationality
which
this
--
to
which
this
court
referred
in
dandridge,
but
about
federal
standards.
and
the
federal
standard
i’m
talking
about
is
the
requirement
that
in
deciding
what
it
is
its
public
assistance
beneficiaries
required,
the
state
must
reach
this
decision
on
a
uniform,
statewide
basis.
it
may
cost
it
on
a
local
basis,
but
the
legislature
cannot
make
the
judgment
and
it
is
not
simply
a
disagreement
of
judgment,
it’s
a
question
of
consistency.
the
legislature
may
not
make
the
judgment.
the
people
in
new
york
city
are
conclusively
presumed
to
need
transportation
and
people
outside
new
york
city
are
conclusively
presumed
not
to
need
transportation.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
would
suppose
all
issues
would
be
open
for
trial.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right.
we
are
only
showing
here
probability
of
success.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
you
need
only
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right.
if
i
can
go
back
for
a
moment
because
appellants
raise
this
issue,
they
talk
about
the
california
differential
and
they
talk
about
the
maryland
differential,
how
are
those
different
from
the
situation
in
this
case.
there
are
three
situations
in
which
hew
does
recognize
cost
variances.
they’re
all
provided
for
in
these
regulations
which
begin
at
34
federal
register
1394
and
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
and
the
first
of
them
is
the
california
situation
in
which
the
state
establishes
a
standard
of
need
on
a
statewide
basis,
but
is
unable
to
pay
the
total
amount
of
that
standard
applies
a
ratable
reduction
or
it
applies
a
maximum,
so
that
there’s
a
gap
between
need
on
the
one
hand
and
actual
payments
on
the
other.
in
that
situation,
any
local
subdivision
may
fill
the
gap
and
that’s
what
some
of
the
california
subdivisions
do.
they
may
make
payments
between
the
level
of
state
payments
and
the
level
of
need
as
determined
by
the
state
under
its
uniform
standard,
and
those
payments
will
not
be
counted
as
income
of
the
recipient
and
therefore
do
go
to
supplement
the
program.
now,
of
course
those
payments
aren’t
subject
to
federal
matching,
the
local
subdivisions
receive
no
funds
for
the
federal
--
from
the
federal
government
for
that.
the
second
situation
is
a
situation
in
which
new
york
city,
let
us
say
determined
that
its
residents
needed
transportation
and
there
was
no
provision
in
the
new
york
state
standard
of
need
for
transportation
as
there
is
now,
new
york
city
could
then
provide
those
services
which
weren’t
provided
for
in
the
state
plan.
and
again
there
would
be
no
conformity
issue,
and
there
would
no
reduction
of
payments
but
again
new
york
city’s
payments
for
transportation
would
be
not
matched
by
federal
payments,
there
would
be
no
federal
funds
involved
in
that.
and
then
the
third
situation
is
the
one
under
which
new
york
state
seeks
to
justify
its
payments
here
that
there
maybe
differences
in
payments
where
those
differences
are
justified
by
differences
in
costs,
but
before
one
can
get
to
the
question
of
differences
in
costs
and
this
again
is
the
essential
point
here,
there
must
be
a
uniform
standard
of
need
and
that
is
what
we
think
is
lacking
here.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
maryland
has
not
been
--
i
should
say
that
maryland
hasn’t
been
called
on
to
justify
this
by
hew
and
what
i’m
saying
is
no
more
than
a
belief
of
the
officials
and
the
department
as
to
what
that
is
about,
but
the
maryland’s
sums
includes
sums
for
housing.
the
maximum
is
in
all
inclusive
maximum
including
housing
expenses,
and
our
belief
is
that
that
difference
reflects
a
difference
in
the
cost
of
urban
housing.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
my
understanding
is
that
new
york
has
not
responded
to
the
letter
of
november.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
couldn’t
--
i
don’t
believe
people
are
meeting
today.
i
think
it’s
at
the
stage
of
a
decision
in
the
regional
office,
whether
to
bring
a
formal
conformity
proceeding
or
not,
but
more
than
that
i’m
afraid
i
simply
don’t
know.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
and
all
the
evidence
is
that
the
cost
to
those
items
is
standard
statewide.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
i
think
new
york
is
trying
to
justify
that
difference
on
a
different
basis.
it’s
not
saying
that
those
items
cost
more
in
new
york
city.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
as
i
understand
their
basis,
they
are
saying
in
addition
to
those
items,
new
york
city
residents
require
money
to
pay
for
security
locks,
and
new
york
city
residents
require
money
to
pay
for
transportation.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it’s
a
household
supplies,
i
don’t
think
in
the
same
sense
that
furniture
wouldn’t
come
within
household
supplies
or
personal
incidentals,
i
don’t
believe
that
under
the
ordinary
circumstances
hardware
would,
i
maybe
wrong
in
that.
these
--
as
i
understand
this
list,
it
doesn’t
provide
for
durables
with
the
exception
of
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right,
museums,
cultural
activities
and
so
forth.
well,
if
i
may
just
say
in
conclusion
in
rosado,
this
court
put
new
york
under
an
obligation
fully
and
realistically
to
reassess
the
recurring
needs
of
its
welfare
recipients
in
this
case,
the
issue
is
whether
the
state
must
not
do
so
on
a
uniform
statewide
basis,
and
we
believe
it
must.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
oh,
surely
your
honor.
our
general
practice
is
not
to
put
lawyers
of
the
government
departments
on
our
brief.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
gather
we
will
be
going
over
until
tomorrow
and
so
for
now,
i
just
want
to
say
a
few
things
rather
briefly
to
get
down
what
seem
to
me,
seem
to
the
united
states
to
be
the
central
features
of
this
case.
first,
i
think
it
is
by
now
clear
that
the
only
issue
in
this
case
is
a
preliminary
injunction.
a
preliminary
injunction
whose
effect
i
think
has
been
dramatically
over
characterized
by
appellants
here.
it
is
not
a
requirement
to
the
state
to
appropriate
funds.
it
is
not
an
injunction
to
the
state
to
pay
the
injunction
tells
the
state
of
new
york
strictly
in
the
terms
of
mr.
justice
harlan's
opinion
for
the
court
in
rosado.
if
the
state
wishes
to
continue
receiving
federal
funds
then
it
must
order
its
need
standard
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
done
on
an
objective
rational
basis
which
are
submission
is
the
requirement
of
federal
law
and
no
more.
second,
i
think
again
to
clear
out
the
point
which
has
been
raised
here.
it
is
fundamentally
our
belief
and
i
will
put
it
in
probability
terms
which
are
all
that
are
required
here
on
preliminary
injunction
that
the
appellants
have
shown
that
in
all
probability
new
york
state
is
applying
two
different
standards
of
need.
one
for
new
york
city
which
includes
the
social
class
of
living
in
a
city,
in
transportation,
in
visits
to
museums,
in
beaches,
and
possibly
laundry
costs
and
a
lot
of
costs,
and
a
number
other
items
and
another
standard
of
need
for
the
rest
of
the
state
in
which
residents
and
the
rest
of
the
state
cannot
obtain
those
item
or
i
should
put
it
more
correctly
because
welfare
recipients
may
spend
the
money
they
received,
however
they
wish
have
no
allowance
for
those
items
no
matter
how
badly
they
may
need
them
even
if
they
live
in
ghetto
and
yonkers
or
in
buffalo.
there
simple
is
no
allowance
for
them
for
these
items.
and
it
is
the
position
of
hew
that
the
standard
of
need
is
a
standard
of
services.
not
a
standard
of
money
necessarily
and
that
the
obligation
of
the
state
is
to
determine
for
itself
and
they
have
great
latitude
in
doing
so.
what
services
are
required
it
is
a
minimum
for
living
in
that
state.
when
they
determine
what
services
are
required
then
they
may
cost
those
services
and
they
may
do
so
as
mr.
sparer
has
just
suggested
on
one
of
two
bases.
and
they
do
so
throughout
the
state
taking
an
average
of
those
costs
throughout
the
state
or
they
may
do
so
on
a
regional
basis.
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
average
expense
for
knox
in
new
york
is
considerably
greater
than
the
average
expense
in
buffalo
or
certainly
than
the
average
expense
in
malone.
and
the
state
would
be
entitled
to
take
that
into
account
and
deciding
how
much
to
pay
on
those
regions.
but
it
must
make
provision
that
if
it's
going
to
provide
that
these
things
are
available
it
must
make
provision
for
their
availability
on
a
statewide
basis.
and
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
really
provides
the
answer
to
your
rent
question.
new
york
has
made
the
judgment.
i
for
myself
would
think
it's
a
wise
judgment
although
not
necessary
one
that
the
costs
of
rent
are
so
variable
in
different
parts
of
the
state
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
treat
them
as
on
average.
and
therefore,
they
treat
them
on
an
individual
basis.
but
in
terms
of
the
standard
of
need,
what's
important
is
that
everyone
in
new
york
state
has
the
right
to
rent.
but
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
live
in
buffalo
or
new
york
city
or
on
nassau
county.
you
have
the
right
to
rent.
you
could
have
it
on
average
basis.
you
could
have
it
on
individual
cost
basis
but
you
have
the
right
to
that
service.
what
new
york
city
is
doing
on
this
case,
we
submit
is
to
say
that
only
people
who
live
in
new
york
city
have
the
right
to
go
to
the
beach.
and
only
people
who
live
on
new
york
city
have
the
right
to
an
allowance
for
transportation
and
only
people
who
live
in
new
york
city
have
the
right
to
an
allowance
that
might
provide
them
some
security
or
repair
their
dilapidated
premises.
those
are
the
only
rationales
we've
heard
and
those
rationales
do
not
meet
federal
requirement
in
uniformity.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no.
i
think
--
i
think
a
--
i
think
the
court
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
the
court
might
but
all
that's
necessary
is
to
affirm
the
preliminary
injunction
and
leave
the
further
proceedings
below.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
we
have.
i
think
one
of
--
i
think
one
of
the
features
that
the
court
might
wish
to
have
in
mind
in
deciding
what
to
do
is
that
there
is
this
new
statute
that
commissioner
wyman
is
under
very
explicit
instructions
from
the
state
of
new
york
about
meeting
the
federal
standards.
he
--
he
knows
there
can
be
no
question
what
our
position
is
now.
let
me
read
you
this.
this
is
from
section
1,
the
enacting
part
of
this
new
statute
of
april
16th.
the
legislature
hereby
and
declares
its
intent
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
sure.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
--
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
i
believe
i
was
asked
at
the
close
of
the
session
about
remand,
ought
there
to
be
a
remand,
ought
this
court
finally
to
pass
on
the
statutory
issue
here.
i
think
i
should
say,
i
think
there
would
be
a
substantial
point
in
remanding
it,
there’s
no
need
to
pass
on
the
statutory
issue
finally.
and
this
is
a
preliminary
injunction.
all
that’s
necessary
is
that
the
court
be
convinced
that
the
appellees
probably
will
succeed
upon
their
cause
of
action
in
the
court
below.
and
as
i
was
starting
to
say,
the
state
of
new
york
in
this
most
recently
enacted
statute,
of
which
i
believe
the
court
has
copies,
has
made
some
policy
judgments
which
i
think
go
to
the
heart
of
some
of
the
doubts.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
sure.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
i
should
think
not.
to
affirm
the
preliminary
injunction,
but
on
the
basis
that
appellees
had
shown
that
they
probably
would
succeed
that
there
was
no
abuse
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
on
the
statute,
i
think
this
court
can
pass
on
that
issue
here.
it
remarked
with
some
strength
in
footnote
in
the
dandridge
case
regarding
the
right
of
appellees
to
put
forward
any
ground
that
would
support
the
judgment
which
they
received
below.
it
remarked
with
some
strength
in
rosado,
that
statutory
issue
should
be
reached
before
constitutional
issues
and
i
think
on
those
basis
that
this
court
would
have
no
difficulty
reaching
the
statutory
issue
and
making
the
judgment
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
which
new
york
has
i
think
conceded.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
that
was
left
open
in
rosado.
i
think
the
situation
in
this
court
in
rosado
however
was
that
the
petitioners
there
had
relief
before
this
court.
here
petitioners
come
into
this
court,
relief
having
been
granted.
we
take
the
position
that
that
relief
is
no
more
than
an
order
of
compliance
with
the
federal
standard
which
in
our
view
new
york
is
in
any
event
obligated
to
comply.
we
believe
that
petitioners
have
made
the
showing,
a
sufficient
showing
that
new
york
is
out
of
compliance
with
that
standard
to
justify
such
an
order.
it
leaves
free
to
new
york
the
choice
which
this
court
said
new
york
must
have
in
rosado,
that
is
the
choice
of
withdrawing
entirely
from
the
federal
program.
and
then
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
them
the
basis
of
the
statute
is
that
new
york
has
in
fact
made
that
choice.
in
the
statute
the
legislature
said
and
i’m
quoting
at
line
nine
of
the
first
page,
if
you
have
it
there,
“the
legislature
hereby
declares
its
intent
to
make
provision
for
the
state
to
meet
all
necessary
federal
requirements
under
the
social
security
act.
and
again
at
line
three,
“it
is
the
intent
of
the
legislature
that
the
department
of
social
services
shall
determine
and
establish
the
standards
of
need
for
public
assistance
in
this
state
in
conformity
with
federal
requirements.”
and
again,
within
the
adopted
amended
section
131
(a)
itself
on
page
4
at
line
twelve,
“if
federal
requirements
make
it
necessary
to
adjust
any
schedule
of
grants
and
allowances
or
part
thereof,
the
department
shall
make
such
adjustments.”
so
that
i
think
new
york’s
judgment
in
this
case
is
entirely
clear
and
as
we
set
out
in
the
rather
long
footnote
of
the
end
of
our
amicus
brief,
is
the
judgment
in
which
all
states
of
the
union
have
essentially
concurred.
and
there
was
also
the
question
yesterday
and
i
think
this
goes
back
to
what
i
was
trying
to
say
during
the
short
time
i
had
then,
“why
was
the
government
had
put
as
part
of
its
question
presented,
whether
the
new
york
state
plan
improperly
favors
residents
of
new
york
city
over
residents
of
other
areas
of
the
state,”
and
this
goes
i
think
to
the
heart
of
the
issue.
the
impropriety
is
not
in
itself
in
the
payment
of
more
money
in
new
york
city
than
new
york
state,
but
as
i
was
trying
to
state
yesterday
in
considering
that
residents
of
new
york
state
need
services,
need
goods,
need
items
which
are
not
under
any
circumstances
made
available
to
residents
of
any
other
part
of
the
state
even
though
their
need
for
those
items
might
equally
be
made
the
same.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
directly
inconsistent
with
the
statute,
with
the
provision
of
the
statute
which
in
both
cases,
section
602
(a)
and
section
1382
(a)
provides
that
a
state
plan
for
aid
and
services
must
provide
that
it
shall
be
in
effect
in
all
political
subdivisions
of
the
state
and
if
administered
by
the
subdivisions
must
be
mandatory
upon
them.
and
it
has
been
since
the
beginning
of
the
act
to
the
departments
understanding
and
interpretation
that
that
means
that
you
cannot
say
within
a
state
the
people
in
part
of
the
state
are
entitled
to
goods
and
services,
i’m
not
talking
about
amounts
of
money
at
this
point,
entitled
the
goods
and
services
to
accounting
for
those
goods
and
services
which
people
in
another
part
of
the
state
simply
have
no
access
too.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
i
think
that’s
right
mr.
justice
stewart.
in
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
it’s
correct
that
it
doesn’t
exist
in
redwood
or
alexandria
bay,
but
i
don’t
think
it
can
be
said
on
the
basis
of
this
record
that
that
need
doesn’t
exist
in
nassau
county
or
in
westchester
county
which
are
crowded,
congested
areas,
where
necessary
services
and
jobs
may
also
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
suppose
it
comes
down
to
how
particular
judgment
you
were
to
make.
as
i
understand
the
new
york
standard
of
need,
the
list
of
basic
needs
which
new
york
state
recognizes
claims
to
recognize
in
its
standard
of
need
doesn’t
include
any
allowance
for
transportation,
that
is
at
page
47
of
the
appendix,
food,
clothing,
personal
incidentals,
household
supplies,
school
expenses,
utilities,
laundries
and
sales
taxes.
now,
it
is
certainly
our
position
that
new
york
state
could
if
it
felt
it
was
necessary
to
the
residents
of
that
state
make
provision
for
transportation
expenses
to
take
your
example.
and
it
could
do
so
either
on
a
basic
need
basis,
or
on
a
special
need
basis,
i
think
the
court
is
familiar
with
that
difference
from
rosado.
if
it
does
on
a
basic
needs
basis,
that
means
that
the
cost
is
to
be
figured
in
to
the
flat
ground
for
every
resident
of
the
state.
in
figuring
that
cost,
the
state
has
the
option
of
doing
it
on
an
average
basis
or
doing
it
on
a
local
regional
basis,
and
if
they
did
it
on
a
local
regional
basis,
i
would
certainly
agree
that
the
amount
for
new
york
city
would
quite
possibly
be
higher
than
the
amount
for
other
parts
of
the
state.
from
the
evidence
of
the
record
it
might
also
be
lower
than
let’s
say
nassau
county.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
it’s
more
than
that
mr.
chief
justice.
we
are
talking
here
not
about
or
at
least
i
am
talking
here,
not
about
the
equal
protection
clause
with
the
judgments
of
rationality
which
this
--
to
which
this
court
referred
in
dandridge,
but
about
federal
standards.
and
the
federal
standard
i’m
talking
about
is
the
requirement
that
in
deciding
what
it
is
its
public
assistance
beneficiaries
required,
the
state
must
reach
this
decision
on
a
uniform,
statewide
basis.
it
may
cost
it
on
a
local
basis,
but
the
legislature
cannot
make
the
judgment
and
it
is
not
simply
a
disagreement
of
judgment,
it’s
a
question
of
consistency.
the
legislature
may
not
make
the
judgment.
the
people
in
new
york
city
are
conclusively
presumed
to
need
transportation
and
people
outside
new
york
city
are
conclusively
presumed
not
to
need
transportation.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
would
suppose
all
issues
would
be
open
for
trial.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right.
we
are
only
showing
here
probability
of
success.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
you
need
only
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right.
if
i
can
go
back
for
a
moment
because
appellants
raise
this
issue,
they
talk
about
the
california
differential
and
they
talk
about
the
maryland
differential,
how
are
those
different
from
the
situation
in
this
case.
there
are
three
situations
in
which
hew
does
recognize
cost
variances.
they’re
all
provided
for
in
these
regulations
which
begin
at
34
federal
register
1394
and
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
and
the
first
of
them
is
the
california
situation
in
which
the
state
establishes
a
standard
of
need
on
a
statewide
basis,
but
is
unable
to
pay
the
total
amount
of
that
standard
applies
a
ratable
reduction
or
it
applies
a
maximum,
so
that
there’s
a
gap
between
need
on
the
one
hand
and
actual
payments
on
the
other.
in
that
situation,
any
local
subdivision
may
fill
the
gap
and
that’s
what
some
of
the
california
subdivisions
do.
they
may
make
payments
between
the
level
of
state
payments
and
the
level
of
need
as
determined
by
the
state
under
its
uniform
standard,
and
those
payments
will
not
be
counted
as
income
of
the
recipient
and
therefore
do
go
to
supplement
the
program.
now,
of
course
those
payments
aren’t
subject
to
federal
matching,
the
local
subdivisions
receive
no
funds
for
the
federal
--
from
the
federal
government
for
that.
the
second
situation
is
a
situation
in
which
new
york
city,
let
us
say
determined
that
its
residents
needed
transportation
and
there
was
no
provision
in
the
new
york
state
standard
of
need
for
transportation
as
there
is
now,
new
york
city
could
then
provide
those
services
which
weren’t
provided
for
in
the
state
plan.
and
again
there
would
be
no
conformity
issue,
and
there
would
no
reduction
of
payments
but
again
new
york
city’s
payments
for
transportation
would
be
not
matched
by
federal
payments,
there
would
be
no
federal
funds
involved
in
that.
and
then
the
third
situation
is
the
one
under
which
new
york
state
seeks
to
justify
its
payments
here
that
there
maybe
differences
in
payments
where
those
differences
are
justified
by
differences
in
costs,
but
before
one
can
get
to
the
question
of
differences
in
costs
and
this
again
is
the
essential
point
here,
there
must
be
a
uniform
standard
of
need
and
that
is
what
we
think
is
lacking
here.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
maryland
has
not
been
--
i
should
say
that
maryland
hasn’t
been
called
on
to
justify
this
by
hew
and
what
i’m
saying
is
no
more
than
a
belief
of
the
officials
and
the
department
as
to
what
that
is
about,
but
the
maryland’s
sums
includes
sums
for
housing.
the
maximum
is
in
all
inclusive
maximum
including
housing
expenses,
and
our
belief
is
that
that
difference
reflects
a
difference
in
the
cost
of
urban
housing.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
my
understanding
is
that
new
york
has
not
responded
to
the
letter
of
november.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
couldn’t
--
i
don’t
believe
people
are
meeting
today.
i
think
it’s
at
the
stage
of
a
decision
in
the
regional
office,
whether
to
bring
a
formal
conformity
proceeding
or
not,
but
more
than
that
i’m
afraid
i
simply
don’t
know.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
and
all
the
evidence
is
that
the
cost
to
those
items
is
standard
statewide.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
i
think
new
york
is
trying
to
justify
that
difference
on
a
different
basis.
it’s
not
saying
that
those
items
cost
more
in
new
york
city.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
as
i
understand
their
basis,
they
are
saying
in
addition
to
those
items,
new
york
city
residents
require
money
to
pay
for
security
locks,
and
new
york
city
residents
require
money
to
pay
for
transportation.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it’s
a
household
supplies,
i
don’t
think
in
the
same
sense
that
furniture
wouldn’t
come
within
household
supplies
or
personal
incidentals,
i
don’t
believe
that
under
the
ordinary
circumstances
hardware
would,
i
maybe
wrong
in
that.
these
--
as
i
understand
this
list,
it
doesn’t
provide
for
durables
with
the
exception
of
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right,
museums,
cultural
activities
and
so
forth.
well,
if
i
may
just
say
in
conclusion
in
rosado,
this
court
put
new
york
under
an
obligation
fully
and
realistically
to
reassess
the
recurring
needs
of
its
welfare
recipients
in
this
case,
the
issue
is
whether
the
state
must
not
do
so
on
a
uniform
statewide
basis,
and
we
believe
it
must.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
oh,
surely
your
honor.
our
general
practice
is
not
to
put
lawyers
of
the
government
departments
on
our
brief.
