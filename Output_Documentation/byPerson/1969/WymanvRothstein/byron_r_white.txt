justice
byron
r.
white
what's
about
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
hew
doesn't
insist
that
the
dollar
amount
paid
that
would
be
the
same
in
every
count.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
read
it
as
indicated
that
there
must
be
a
statewide
standard
but
as
to
what
the
need
is
but
if
you
can
show
the
satisfying
need
to
touch
you
unless
one
kind
and
another.
there
could
be
differences
in
money
amounts
paid.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
if
--
i
suppose
hew
could
say
to
you
--
well,
if
sounds
like
you
got
a
statewide
standard
but
somehow
rather
you
pay
different
amounts
and
you
haven't
got
any
evidence
that
there
is
difference
in
cost
and
there
must
be
a
difference
in
the
standard.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
on
this
record
we
can
examine
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
the
federal
act
requires
equal
money
amounts
statewide,
in
each
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
there
is,
there
could
still
be
a
statewide
uniform
standard
and
variations
in
money
amounts
without
violating
the
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
now,
what's
the
objection
here
to
--
how
do
--
what
do
you
understand
the
united
states'
position
to
be
that
there
is
not
a
uniform
state
standard
or
that
he
just
hasn't
shown
that
there's
variation
at
any
cost.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
your
position,
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
then
--
and
what
is
the
different
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
--
in
the
standard
of
need
is
there
some
miscellaneous
category
or
is
it
every
listed?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
could
it
--
how
would
it,
let's
assume
that
laundry
cost
the
same
in
new
york
city
and
in
nassau
county
per
pound.
or
however
each
shirt
cost
the
same.
the
only
thing
is
that
shirts
get
dirtier
often
in
new
york
city.
now,
how
would
that
be
reflected
in
the
--
you
could
still
pay
the
new
york
people,
i
suppose
more
for
laundry?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
increase
standard
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
by?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you've
got
to
pay
him
for
laundry.
you've
got
to
pay
him
for
laundry
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
but
what
if
you
don't
have
it
in
nassau
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
then
--
then
were
not
going
to
listen
to
the
argument
much
here,
are
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
wouldn't
listen
very
long
about
it
here
would
we
on
an
equal
protection
basis?
we
might
on
the
statutory
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
i'm
not
interested
in
when
you
argue
somebody
else's
right
under
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
therefore,
this
should
mean
that
we
should
finally
settle
statutory
argument
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
first
of
the
preliminary
injunctions
--
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you
don't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
united
states
has
taken
the
final
position
though
that
conflict
with
the
federal
statute
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
strauss,
well
although
you
read
the
items
that
went
into
new
york
standard
of
need
--
now
those
items
are
standard
statewide?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
the
standard
is
--
insofar
as
the
standard
is
described
by
those
items,
that
is
the
same
statewide?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
intention
is
that
new
york
has
not
substantiated
the
difference
in
cost
for
those
items
as
between
the
different
parts
of
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
legislature
may
not
conclusively
presume
that
are
different
like
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
is
the
different
basis
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
within
those
broad
categories
making
up
the
standards,
you
need
like
household
items?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
must
be
fitting
them
in
somewhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you’re
saying
--
your
claim
is
not
that
the
legislature
has
made
a
judge
--
an
unacceptable
judgment
about
cost
of
various
items
but
if
--
but
that
they
want
to
pay
for
items
for
new
york
city
residence,
if
they
refuse
to
pay
for
elsewhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
district
court
has
never
fashioned
an
injunction
--
preliminary
injunction
based
on
the
possible
statutory
validity?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
your
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
precisely
would
be
different
in
the
injunction
that
should
be
entered.
just
assume
for
the
moment
that
new
york
is
probably
correct
or
that
the
government
is
probably
correct
on
the
statutory
ground,
now
what
injunction
on
that
basis
should
be
issued?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
nonconformity.
justice
byron
r.
white
until
that
should
be
formed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let’s
assume
we
decided
on
the
statutory
ground
here
that
new
york
was
wrong
and
the
federal
government
is
right
then
that’s
the
only
difference
could
be
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
really
want
to
--
are
you
really
trying
to
justify
deciding
the
equal
protection
argument
before
the
statutory
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
not
but
you
may
not
be
in
compliance
either,
that’s
what
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
united
states
says
that,
yes
there’s
--
looks
like
there’s
uniform
standard
in
terms
of
these
are
the
items.
but
apparently,
they
argued
that
you’re
giving
new
york
city
residents
money
for
items
that
you
won’t
give
money
to
suburban
residents
for.
now,
what’s
your
response
to
that?
are
you
or
aren’t
you
giving
money
for
certain
expenses
that
you
won’t
give
suburbanites?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
because
--
is
it
because
those
items
aren’t
available
in
these
surrounding
counties
or
is
it
because
they
cost
more
in
new
york
city
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
are
you
--
would
you
categorize
this
justification
as
saying
that
in
just
costing
out
the
standards,
it
costs
more
in
new
york?
justice
byron
r.
white
rather
you’re
saying
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it’s
so
obvious,
why
is
there
such
difficulty
in
demonstrating
this
to
the
hew?
i
mean
if
it’s
just
perfectly
obvious
about
the
crime
rate
and
about
the
sales
tax
and
things
like
this
then
why
is
there
--
this
big
rumble
between
you
and
the
hew?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
did
hew
say
to
you?
i
mean
why
can’t
--
if
you
expect
us
to
see
this,
they
ought
to
be
able
to
see
it,
didn’t
they,
if
you’re
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
you
had
never
answered?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
would
you
object
--
why
would
you
object,
i
guess
just
because
you
don’t
have
to
litigate
but
would
you
object
demonstrating
this
in
the
district
court,
if
you
can’t
settle
it
--
if
you
can’t
settle
it
administratively?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah
but
the
end
of
that
argument
is
that
you
shouldn’t
have
to
litigate
it
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
you’re
suggesting
that
you
come
to
the
end
of
the
litigation,
though
once
you
demonstrate
the
legislative
judgment
about
something
that
reasonable
minds
can
differ
on.
from
then
on,
you
ought
to
stop
at
that
point,
don’t
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don’t
want
to
go
on
and
say
really
which
reasonable
man
is
right.
you
don’t
want
to
have
to
decide
that
in
litigation?
justice
byron

what's

justice
byron
