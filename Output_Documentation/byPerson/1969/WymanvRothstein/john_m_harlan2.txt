justice
john
m.
harlan
what
does
the
government
mean
by
this
question
it
present
rather
than
new
york's
state
plan
of
public
assistance,
improperly
favors
residents
of
new
york
city
over
residents
of
other
areas
of
the
state?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
mean
by
improperly
favors?
justice
john
m.
harlan
why?
justice
john
m.
harlan
over
new
york
city
residents
than
other
parts
of
the
state.
why
did
they
say
it
does?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
say
rather
you
knew
the
question
presented
one
of
this
is
the
new
york
state
plan
improperly
favors
residents
of
new
york
city
over
residents
of
other
sections
of
the
state.
what's
the
basis
for
that
question
presented?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
in
there
it
seems
to
me
from
what
you
say.
they're
claiming
that
it
shouldn't
be
just
one
raised.
the
new
york
city
and
one
raised
with
any
other
part
of
the
state,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
lower
court
is
wrong
in
that
respect,
i
gather
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
should
have
it
done?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
not
make
the
constitutional
issue
as
very
dependent.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
think
the
disposition
in
rosado
is
indicated
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
disposition
you
made
in
rosado,
you
think
is
not
indicated
for
this
case,
on
the
statutory
ground.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
we
sent
it
back
for
a
remand,
didn't
we
in
rosado?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
--
do
you
think
they
finally
submit
the
resolve,
the
statutory
issue
or
just
say
there's
enough
likelihood
of
success
on
it
to
justify
the
preliminary
injunction?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
under
your
theory
of
remand,
we
go
no
further
[inaudible]
basis
to
probability
of
success
in
this
case
then
go
back
to
district
court
and
the
district
court
would
be
free
to
reject
to
which
the
hew
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
fact
is
that
we
don’t
have
to
accept
that
this
level,
the
hew
recommendations?
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
we
have
to
say
is
that
the
temporary
injunction
has
got
a
sufficient
basis,
probability
of
success
justify
it’s
continuance
and
then
send
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
to
sort
out
the
problem?
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
course
this
whole
discussion
[inaudible]
tend
to
mix
up
this
statutory
arguments
[inaudible]
and
constitutional
argument
and
the
federal
government
[inaudible]
to
new
york
on
any
basis
it
wants,
any
basis
it
wants.
therefore
what
new
york
would
be
entitled
to
do
as
a
matter
of
equal
protection
is
wholly
irrelevant
it
seems
to
me
of
what
whether
or
not
on
congress
has
[inaudible]
the
use
of
these
federal
funds
on
the
tax
of
the
hew
says
the
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
question
of
what
new
york
further
tax
--
could
not
do
in
drawing
distinctions
between
out
state
or
out
of
the
city
province
or
not
is
wholly
irrelevant
to
the
statutory
problems?
justice
john
m.
harlan
congress
say
that
they
couldn’t
make
this
non-uniformity?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
can
you
deal
with
the
question
it
seems
to
me
that
possibly
the
scope
of
the
injunction
that’s
a
different
question,
but
the
main
question
is
on
the
statutory
ground
is
hew
view
of
the
statute
peripheral?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that’s
the
question
of
--
that
injunction
if
that
turns
out
to
be
the
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
maybe
a
question
of
whether
we
should
deal
with
it
up
here,
they
are
taking
a
flatfoot
position
up
here
rightly
or
wrongly
that
this
violates
hew
regulations
and
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
