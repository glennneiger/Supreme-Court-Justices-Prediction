mr.
edward
v.
sparer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
this
court.
in
the
brief
said
in
the
argument,
may
i
just
this
moment
the
appellants
have
engaged
in
various
reasoning,
various
speculations
as
to
possible
differentials
between
the
cost
of
living
in
new
york
city
and
the
cost
of
living
in
the
surrounding
counties.
i
hope
to
examine
those
speculations
in
as
much
detail
as
time
permits
in
the
latter
half
of
my
argument.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
susceptible
to
precise
mathematical
proof
as
to
what
the
cost
of
living
of
objective,
what
the
cost
of
living
of
the
items
and
the
basic
needs
schedules
of
new
york's
state
are
and
new
york
city
and
in
the
surrounding
counties.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
and
to
demonstrate
that
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
we're
saying
that
in
fact,
it
is
the
same
not
inevitably
the
same.
not
at
all,
it
could
be
different
and
if
the
proof
were
and
there
are
cost
of
living
studies
conducted
all
the
time
by
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics
which
was
introduced
below
by
the
new
york
state
welfare
department
which
study
was
introduced
below
by
the
various
locals
social
service
agencies
such
as
the
new
york
city
social
service
department,
the
nassau
social
service
department,
the
westchester
social
service
department
despite
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
--
despite.
they
all
agree.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
they
all
agree
that
the
costs
of
the
basic
items
going
to
food
clothing,
furnishing
are
withdraws
that
on
furnishing.
the
schedules
of
the
local
social
service
agencies
show
that
household
furnishing
are
slightly
more
expensive
in
the
suburban
counties
than
they
are
in
the
new
york
city
area
but
there
is
a
conclusion
on
this
subject
which
appellants
have
made
and
which
is
very,
very
pertinent
to
the
question
your
honor
is
raising
with
me
and
it
was
raised
by
mr.
justice
black
a
moment
ago.
unfortunately,
this
conclusion
was
published
too
late
for
citation
in
our
brief.
this
published
in
the
103rd
annual
report
of
the
new
york
social
service
department
and
the
new
york
state
board
of
social
welfare
and
appellant
wyman
on
april
9,
1970
and
i
quote
from
page
4
of
the
appendix
to
that
brief
which
is
a
report
dated
november
21st
but
which
was
not
made
publicly
available
at
least
to
us
until
the
time
this
was
release
after
our
brief
was
written.
it
says
this
and
i
think
its
right
in
the
heart
of
the
statutory
issue
with
this
case.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
yes.
i
would
like
to
do
that
very
much
your
honor.
i'll
quote
the
relevant
two
sentences.
“we
have
considered
evidence
concerning
the
cost
of
living.”
these
are
the
appellants
speaking
in
their
103rd
report.
“we
have
considered
evidence
concerning
the
cost
of
living
in
different
regions
of
the
state
and
recommend
that
there
be
one
statewide
schedule
of
monthly
allowance
for
all
basic
items
of
need,
exclusive
of
shelter
costs.
the
evidence
presented
to
us
indicates
that
the
major
source
of
differentials
and
the
cost
of
living
and
shelter
cost
which
is
not
included
in
the
flat
grant
and
the
effect
of
variation
and
other
items
of
basic
need
for
different
regions
results
in
approximately
the
same
total
cost
of
living
for
households
comprise
of
the
same
number
of
persons
and
all
such
reasons
which
goes
considerable
beyond
our
case
because
we're
simply
talking
about
the
suburban
counties.”
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
the
legislature
so
far
as
we
can
determine
your
honor,
has
considered
no
cost
of
living
studies
whatsoever.
the
legislature
has
simply
cited
in
the
second
amended
version
of
13-a,
that
is
the
version
presently
in
effect
not
the
version
which
was
in
effect
when
the
case
began
and
not
the
version
which
will
be
in
effect
when
the
case
began
and
the
not
the
version
will
be
in
effect
on
june
1st,
when
the
rosado
they
tend
to
compliance
will
go
into
effect.
the
legislature
has
found
state
it
in
its
findings
that
finds
as
a
fact
that
the
cost
to
living
in
urban
areas
is
greater
due
to
the
higher
social
complexity
of
living
in
those
areas
due
to
the
higher
complexity
in
utilizing
programs
services
and
facilities.
this
was
the
reason,
the
reason,
given
by
appellant
wyman
to
the
court
below.
the
reason
i
would
like
to
examine
in
some
detail
because
i
think
it's
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
oh!
i
misunderstood
your
honor's
question.
the
legislature
fixed
a
statutory
scale
which
reflects
a
certain
difference
between
new
york
city
and
the
rest
of
the
region
and
then
instructed
the
commissioner,
appellant
wyman,
to
adjust
the
scale
for
the
other
regions
if
he
finds
that
the
cost
of
the
items
which
comprise
the
basic
needs
in
the
other
regions.
this
is
more
or
less
and
appellant
wyman
in
the
one
opportunity
he
had
to
act
prior
to
the
injunction
in
this
case
did
so
act.
did
narrow
the
differential
set
initially
in
the
legislative
maximums
as
he
was
permitted
by
the
legislature
but
did
not,
did
not
narrow
it
sufficiently.
he
leaves
a
7%
to
16%
gap
in
the
total
amount
of
differential
which
we
consider
is
not
slight
at
all
but
of
very,
very
serious
consequence
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
that
is
quite
a
job.
that
is
quite
a
job,
and
it's
the
very
difficult
job
and
the
evidence
indicates
the
costs
are
the
same.
there
have
been
from
the
inception
of
this
case
your
honors,
two
issues,
the
constitutional
issue
and
the
statutory
issue.
the
appellants
just
before
made
what
i
consider
the
rather
surprising
statement
that
we
were
unaware
of
the
administrative
policies
which
lead
hew
to
that
conclusion
that
it
stated
in
its
brief.
i
think
that
this
case
can
be
decided
on
the
probabilities,
that
is
the
issue
before
the
court
whether
the
preliminary
injunction
can
be
affirmed.
it
should
be
affirmed,
can
be
decided
on
the
probabilities
of
success
of
plaintiffs
in
the
statutory
argument.
and
i
think
the
reason
for
surprise
on
the
part
of
appellants'
surprises
me.
there
are
several
outstanding
features
of
this
case
with
regard
to
the
statutory
argument.
first,
there
are
three
causes
of
actions
set
forth
causes
of
action
set
forth
in
the
complaint
to
this
case.
the
first
three
deal
purely
with
statutory
ground.
secondly,
of
two
briefs
submitted
to
the
lower
court
by
the
appellees
on
the
substantive
issues
one
dealt
almost
exclusively
with
the
statutory
issue.
we
were
in
fact
had
dealt
with
it
at
some
length
the
greater
length
in
our
brief
dealt
with
it
before
this
cost
--
court.
we
were
quite
worthy
then.
third,
the
court
below
devoted
two
pages
of
its
opinion
to
the
statutory
issue.
it
didn't
conclude
on
the
statutory
issue
because
it
believes
that
its
duty
was
to
refer
to
hew
but
it
devoted
two
pages
and
what
it
is
an
obviously
sympathetic
consideration
a
plaintiff's
position.
fourth,
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
in
referring
to
hew
on
that.
i
would
conclude
on
the
basis
of
the
majority
opinion
in
rosado
that
the
lower
court
was
wrong
your
honor.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
it
should
have
considered
the
statutory
argument.
invited
hew
to
submit
an
amicus
brief
in
its
views
and
attempted
to
see
if
the
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
absolutely,
your
honor
and
i
urge
that
this
court
decide
whether
or
not
the
preliminary
injunction
should
be
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
the
statutory
issue
can
be
evaluated
at
this
stage
and
we
think
it
can.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
oh,
i
think
its
clear
your
honor.
i
think
that
he
--
in
addition
to
the
fact
as
i've
already
cited
there
is
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
i'm
not
sure
i
properly
understand
your
honor's
question.
if
what
your
honor
is
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
you
sent
it
back
for
a
remand
after
you
concluded
that
the
new
york
state
standard
of
need
as
suggested
by
131-a
violated
section
402
(a)
23.
if
you
reach
the
same
conclusion
here
with
regard
to
the
difference
that's
use
of
a
differentials
there
is
a
proper
basis
for
affirming
the
preliminary
injunction
which
was
before
the
court.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
i
think
that
in
light
of
what
the
appellants'
argument
is
that
they
have
nothing
further
to
say
on
the
statutory
issue.
you
could
finally
resolve
but
i
don't
think
you
have
to.
i
think
you
can
simply
state
that
the
--
there's
enough
probability
to
it
to
reach
conclusion.
i
know
that
the
appellants
have
stated
both
in
the
reply
brief
and
before
the
court
just
a
moment
ago
that
the
statutory
issue
is
the
same
as
the
constitutional
issue
on
equal
protection
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
well,
your
honor,
as
i
understand
their
position
which
if
i
may
have
misinterpreted
as
oral
statement
but
their
brief
is
quite
clear.
thus,
whether
that
i'm
quoting
from
page
13
of
the
reply
brief,
“thus,
whether
the
constitution,
the
social
security
act
of
the
hew
regulations
be
conceded
the
touchstone
in
any
cases
whether
the
differentials
are
arbitrary.
if
they
meet
the
test
of
rationality
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
they
cannot
reasonably
be
held
violative
of
any
--
anything
in
the
act
or
regulations.”
that
is
their
argument.
i
think
that's
an
error.
i
think
it's
quite
clear
as
we
consider
the
hew
regulations
that
one
can
arguably
meet
the
test
of
minimal
rationality
under
the
equal
protection
clause
and
not
meet
the
requirements
of
the
regulation.
i
think
that's
very
clear.
and
i
--
with
your
permission
i
would
like
to
move
on
to
a
consideration
of
the
regulation.
the
regulation
embodies
four
related
requirements
which
are
best
understood
when
considered
together.
first,
the
regulation
and
the
hew
material
require
that
the
standard
of
need,
the
standard
of
need
which
is
compose
of
both
items
of
need
and
a
money
assessment
of
those
items
of
need
that
the
standard
of
need
be
statewide.
that
is
if
the
state
is
going
to
recognize
clothing
needs
in
one
part
of
the
state,
the
recipient
is
going
to
recognized
clothing
needs
in
any
other
part
of
the
state
where
people
need
clothing.
it
must
be
statewide,
number
one.
number
two,
the
standard
--
the
money
amount
established
by
the
standard
must
be
said
on
the
basis
of
objective
facts.
that
is
an
important
part
of
the
regulatory
requirement.
number
three,
the
standard
must
be
uniformly
applied
throughout
the
state
unless
subject
the
facts
show
that
there's
actually
a
variation
in
the
cost
of
living,
in
the
cost
of
the
items
throughout
the
state.
and
number
four,
if
the
state
can't
afford
to
meet
the
full
cost
of
the
standard
of
need
because
the
maximums
because
of
insufficient
funds
any
reduction
in
meeting
that
full
standard
must
be
applied
uniformly.
the
idea
as
hew
expresses
it
in
his
handbook
is
that
recipients
with
similar
needs
wherever
they
live
in
the
state
with
similar
resources
will
get
equal
benefits.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
that's
correct.
near
the
court
injunction
that
our
argument
requires
that
the
standard
go
up
for
recipients
new
york
city
could
come
down
but
i
call
your
honor's
attention
to
the
very
consideration
you've
placed,
this
court
place
forward
in
the
rosado.
and
that
is
there
is
a
point
this
court
argued
to
an
articulation
of
the
standard
of
need
which
reflects
social
realities
and
cost
realities
throughout
the
state.
there
is
a
point
because
if
that's
going
to
be
cut
back,
at
least
the
people
of
a
state
in
the
legislature
of
the
state
should
know
how
much
cut
back
is
actually
going
and
how
far
sure
the
state
is
falling.
now
with
the
purpose
of
402
(a)
23,
i
just
suggest
to
you
that
the
state
is
free
to
cut
new
york
city
back
and
move
the
suburban
counties
up
but
it
must
do
so
on
the
basis
of
a
frankly
recognize
standard
of
need
which
is
uncommon
to
both
of
these
places
and
one
which
was
also
affected
by
402
(a)
23.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
well,
your
honor,
the
objective
findings
have
already
been
made
by
the
appellant
commissioner
in
his
report
and
they've
been
made
again,
again,
again,
again.
they
were
--
have
made
for
years
now
but
the
cost
of
these
items
are
the
same.
they
don't
have
to
meet
those
scores.
they
can
cutback.
they
can
pay
a
less
of
percentage.
but
unless
they
come
up
with
some
kind
of
objective
showing,
some
kind
of
study,
some
kind
of
consideration
of
the
actually
costs
of
these
items
which
shows
that
the
items
vary
in
one
region
or
another
or
more
or
less
than
one
figure
or
another.
they
simply
can't
state
that
new
york
city
shall
receive
this
amount
and
nassau
shall
receive
some
other
amount.
i
think
what
has
taken
place
in
this
court
in
this
case
is
that
one
of
the
appellants
have
done
and
done
clearly
in
terms
of
their
argument
is
establish
a
different
standard
of
need.
not
a
different
cost
but
a
different
standard
of
need
for
new
york
city
then
for
the
suburban
counties.
and
if
one
examines,
anyone
of
the
arguments
that
they
put
forth
that
becomes
quite
clear.
for
example,
the
primary
argument
cited
as
a
finding
by
the
legislature,
relied
on
by
the
appellant
below
is
that
there
is
a
higher
cost
of
social
living
in
new
york
city
which
requires
transportation
to
daycare
centers,
to
welfare
centers,
to
beaches,
to
museums,
to
clinics
and
so
forth.
well,
there
was
an
examination
of
appellant
wyman
on
this
question.
and
the
results
of
the
examination
made
quite
clear
what
took
place.
let
me
cite
two
of
these
issues.
question:“do
recipients
to
your
knowledge
have
a
need
for
transportation
to
the
welfare
centers
in
nassau
county?”
answer
of
appellant
wyman:
"i
should
imagine
so
on
occasion.”
question:"approximately
the
same
as
recipients
in
new
york
city?”
answer
of
appellant
wyman:"i
don't
know.”
question:"no
reason
to
believe
otherwise?”
answer:"no,
reason
to
be
otherwise.”
question:"are
you
aware
of
the
daycare
centers
for
children
in
nassau
county?”
answer:"yes.”
question:"they
are
all
--
there
are
some
and
there
are
daycare
centers
for
children
in
westchester
county?”
"yes.”
"and
for
those
people
who
need
to
use
them
are
transportation
costs
involved?”
"to
the
extent
that
the
transportation
system's
costs
more
than
new
york
city,
the
cost
is
more.
the
evidence
had
already
showed
that
the
transportation
cost
more
in
nassau?”
answer:"that
is
correct."
what
took
place
in
this
case
and
what
is
taken
place
in
this
case
is
that
the
legislature
is
seen
fit
to
declare
a
different
standard
of
need
to
provide
a
differential
which
allows
for
transportation
cost
of
some
sort
to
the
welfare
center,
to
daycare
centers,
to
beaches
in
new
york
city
and
not
to
do
that
in
nassau
and
not
to
do
that
in
yorkers,
not
to
do
that
in
poughkeepsie.
we
would
assert
on
the
equal
protection
issue
as
a
basis
of
minimal
rationality
and
i
know
to
this
court
that
the
court
below
decided
not
simply
on
the
express
special
scrutiny
standard
which
was
rejected
in
dandridge.
but
on
the
basis
of
the
minimal
rationality
test
as
well.
but
traditionally
for
protection
standard
test
as
well.
i
would
assert
that
a
test
doesn't
make
sense
on
the
basis
of
any
common
relation
to
experience
to
assert
that
the
mother
in
yorkers
or
the
mother
in
nassau
who
has
to
pay
more
to
get
her
kids
to
a
beach
or
to
get
to
the
welfare
center
itself
or
to
get
to
a
daycare
center
should
receive
nothing
while
an
allowance
is
provided
for
the
mothers
in
new
york
city
doesn't
make
sense
but
the
point
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
well,
your
honor
this
court
noted
in
rosado
that
speculation
is
the
mode
this
to
be
in
shown
and
i
would
not
engage
in
speculation
as
to
motive
but
i
would
sight
the
brief
for
appellants
on
this
issue.
and
i
would
call
your
attention
to
page
38.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
page
38.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
of
the
brief
for
appellants.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
what
appellants
argue
with
that
point
is
that
the
system
created
under
the
section
131-a
is
kind
of
analogous
to
a
matching
grand
program
since
welfare
county
officials
are
empowered
to
make
application
for
increase
amounts
on
the
approval
of
the
appropriate
legislative
body.
they
go
on
to
state
this
which
is
really
at
the
heart
of
the
problem
in
this
case.
they
go
on
to
state
that
this
demonstrates
the
state
legislature's
concern
for
the
ability
to
pay
of
various
welfare
districts
and
stay
would
be
required
to
pay
one
quarter
of
any
increase
over
the
establish
levels.
i
think
that
what's
going
on
this
case
your
honor.
i
think
they're
right
in
what
they
say
there
that
the
legislature
was
concern
with
the
ability
of
upstate
localities
to
pay
their
one
quarter
of
the
welfare
share.
if
one
looks
into
the
hew
regulations
and
the
hew
materials
that
problem
is
exactly
the
problem
which
the
uniformity
regulations
are
aimed
at
and
were
aimed
that
from
1935
on.
it's
a
very
old
regulation
we're
talking
about
here
and
the
reason
they
were
aimed
at
this
problem
from
1935
on
is
that
the
general
characteristic
of
public
welfare
in
the
united
states
prior
to
the
social
security
acts
passage
in
1935
was
that
each
local
county
throughout
the
state
paid
exactly
what
they
please
whether
they
pay
full
need,
half
need,
no
need,
a
variation
was
absolutely
enormous.
this
was
one
of
the
major
problems.
the
reason
of
variation
was
enormous
was
that
welfare
standards
were
dependent
upon
the
localities
willingness
to
raise
the
taxes
in
many
localities
a
great
problems
as
hew's
properly
interpreted
the
requirement
that
the
states
financially
participate
in
each
locality
throughout
the
state
that
requirement
means
that
the
state
must
financially
participate
through
the
extent
necessary
to
relieve
a
locality
of
any
problem
it
has
in
meeting
a
uniform
schedule.
the
state
must
put
in
enough
money
to
make
sure
that
a
uniform
schedule
was
met.
now,
if
new
york
state
is
permitted
to
retreat
on
this
issue
will
allow
localities
to
have
a
local
--
to
have
a
lower
standard
because
of
the
problems
they
have
in
raising
taxes
and
new
york
has
decided
that
they
cannot
pay
one
quarter
of
the
total
share.
we
are
taking
a
very
long
step
back
to
the
pre-1935
situation.
this
is
what
motivated
the
hew
regulation.
this
is
the
real
interest
of
welfare
recipients
in
this
case
throughout
the
country
and
i
would
argue
in
answer,
mr.
justice
stewart
to
your
question.
don't
you
think
the
legislature
knows
better
than
we?
the
legislature
may
or
may
not
know
the
local
condition
that
if
than
anyone
else.
i
don't
think
this
case
raises
that
issue.
i
think
this
case
raises
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
legislature
has
in
fact
created
disparate
standard
of
need
of
these
localities
because
of
their
financial
problems
and
that
is
what's
taken
place.
it
is
exactly
what's
taken
place.
if
you
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
25.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
25%.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
which
is
a
--
throughout
the
state
another
25%
federal
government
about
50.
those
are
approximate
figures.
at
25%
is
considerable
figure.
that's
not
the
way
the
system
works
throughout
the
united
states
but
in
those
states
where
the
localities
have
to
pay
a
large
share
of
the
local
welfare
burden,
welfare
is
a
very
hot
and
difficult
political
issue.
it
just
follows
as
day
follows
night,
and
night
follows
day.
the
same
problem,
your
honor,
with
regard
to
the
creation
of
a
different
standard
of
need
is
seen
when
we
consider
any
of
the
other
arguments
asserted
by
appellants.
for
example,
the
rent
control
argument,
what
do
they
say
here?
they
say
that,
does
rent
control
in
new
york
and
not
in
some
of
other
counties
but
of
course
there
is
but
let's
assume
that's
accurate.
therefore,
there's
lower
rent
in
new
york
city
than
some
of
other
counties.
therefore,
the
amount
of
money
given
in
the
special
rent
grants
to
new
york
city
welfare
recipients
is
last
than
that
given
to
welfare
recipients
in
the
other
counties.
therefore
it's
proper
for
the
legislature
to
make
this
up
to
new
york
city
recipients
to
some
extent
so
that
they
can
buy
some
other
things
by
giving
them
a
little
extra
money.
this
is
said
right
on
the
bottom
in
their
brief.
they
make
no
bones
about
it
in
their
reply
brief.
initially,
it
seems
we
misunderstood
their
argument
in
their
reply
brief.
they
come
right
back
and
say,
we
misunderstood
what
they're
saying,
does
lower
rents
within
the
new
york
city
area
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
page
11
of
appellant's
reply
brief,
at
the
very
top.
thus,
lower
rents
within
new
york
city
directly
result
in
a
lower
standard
of
need
and
higher
rents
outside
the
city.
in
the
highest
standard
of
need
compensating
for
the
slightly
higher
allowance
within
the
city
with
components
of
the
standard
of
need
other
than
rents.
now,
they
start
with
the
fact
that
rents
are
paid
especially
according
to
actual
need
in
that
part
of
a
basic
need
requirements
which
is
what
at
issue
in
this
case.
then
they
state
that
we
give
more
rent
because
the
people
upstate
have
more
of
a
rent
need
so
they
give
more
money
which
goes
into
rent.
and
then
they
state
will
give
some
extra
to
new
york
city,
so
that
they
can
buy
some
other
things,
but
that's
establishing
a
different
standard
of
need
for
new
york
city.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
no,
your
honor.
not
in
the
way
you
phrase
the
question.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
i
would
phrase
the
question
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
well,
taking
my
statement
of
facts
your
honor,
i'd
rephrase
the
question
this
way.
i
would
say
that
if
what
new
york
state
has
done
is
average
out
the
costs
of
rent
throughout
the
state.
average
out
the
cost
of
all
these
other
basic
need
items
and
presented
one
average
sum
to
the
people
of
new
york
state
that
would
not
deny
equal
protection
even
those
some
benefited
more
and
some
benefited
less.
but
i
would
state
that
when
new
york
state
decides
that
it's
going
to
pay
rent
and
especially,
so
that
everybody
has
their
full
rent
needs
pay.
and
then
it's
going
to
take
another
sum
and
meet
other
basic
needs.
and
then
it's
going
to
pay
up
to
16%
more
to
people
in
new
york
city
because
they
don't
have
as
much
money
to
pay
rent
which
they
don't
need
to
pay
rent.
then
there's
something
--
there's
something
irrational
about
that
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
yes.
the
rational
basis
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
oh,
yes.
well,
it's
not
anymore
precise
as
precise.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
the
commissioner
has
average
figures,
who
are
they
paid
for
rent
to
welfare
recipients
in
new
york
city
and
elsewhere
which
they
referred
to.
if
they
wanted
to
pay
those
average
figures
that
would
be
fine.
they've
chosen
not
to
and
that's
fine
too.
they've
chosen
to
pay
the
exact
amount
of
rent
and
that's
fine.
that
doesn't
raise
any
equal
protection
questions.
all
we
argue
is
that
haven't
chosen
one
method
or
other
to
pay
rent
to
then
state
to
the
people
upstate
that
because
you
have
a
higher
cost
than
people
in
new
york
city
have,
we're
going
to
give
the
people
of
new
york
city
16%
more
to
buy
things
which
we're
not
allowing
you
to
buy
because
we're
not
giving
you
any
money
to
buy
him
with.
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
at
all.
now,
as
i
argue
your
honor,
this
court
need
not
reach
that
question
in
terms
of
equal
protection,
that's
a
question
of
judgment
as
to
rationality
and
whether
how
much
difference
is
going
to
be
given
to
the
legislative
judgment
on
this.
in
terms
of
the
statutory
requirement
of
statewideness,
the
violation
is
clearly.
it
could
not
be
clearer.
it
is
--
the
problem
i
think
on
appellant's
part
occurs
because
they
confused
the
standard
of
minimum
rationality
for
equal
protection
and
the
standard
under
the
hew
requirements
of
uniformity.
they
confuse
them
badly
and
therefore
don't
address
in
reality
the
standard
of
uniformity.
i
would
conclude
your
honor
that
we
could
engage
in
the
same
process
as
we
have
in
our
briefs
with
regard
to
every
one
of
the
arguments
raised
by
appellants.
but
i
would
conclude
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
statewide,
yes.
unless
there's
a
variation
in
the
cause
which
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
in
the
cause.
yes.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
yes.
now
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
as
i
understand
it,
the
united
states'
position
which
will
be
exploit
by
the
united
states
shortly
is
this.
first,
they
have
established
a
different
standard
for
new
york
city
because
they
are
allowing
a
different
kind
of
position
in
there.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
that
is
our
position,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
the
different
standard
is
that
they
are
allowing
by
their
own
language.
monies
for
transportation
to
daycare
centers,
to
social
welfare
centers,
and
so
forth,
the
people
of
new
york
city
which
they're
not
allowing
elsewhere.
even
though
by
their
own
testimony,
the
people
elsewhere
have
those
very
same
needs.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
well,
the
--
the
principle
of
standard
of
need
allows
as
hew
sets
forth
in
the
three
simplified
methods
allows
the
states
to
combine
a
wide
variety
of
items.
in
the
past,
new
york
did
not
combine,
it
listed
individually.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
now,
it
combines.
but
those
combined
items
reflect
particular
matters.
they
give
one
overall
sum
for
that.
and
what
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
you
could
increase
the
standard
on
the
showing
that
shirts
get
dirty
in
new
york
city.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
you
could
increase
the
standard
for
new
york
city,
yes.
the
standard
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
the
standard.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
or
you
could
create
a
special
need
allowance
for
laundry
which
is
allowed
under
hew
regulations
in
which
you
pretty
much
use
to
be
the
case
in
new
york
city.
the
only
point
which
is
relevant
about
that
that
i
see
to
this
case
is
that
if
you
create
a
special
allowance
for
laundry.
let's
say
$10.00
a
month
maximum
depended
on
how
much
need
do
you
actually
have
to
wash
shirts
for
a
month
long.
you
have
to
apply
that
statewide
so
that
people
who
live
in
buffalo
and
working
in
or
near
or
live
near
a
steel
mill
in
buffalo
will
also
happen
to
have
that
same
need
can
also
get
the
shirts
washed.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
if
you
don't
have
it
on
nassau
county
unless
it
can
be
shown
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
pardon
me?
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
well,
i
--
i
know
you're
not
interested
in
laundry
cost
in
particularly
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
i
think
welfare
recipients
can
and
ought
to
be
in
a
position
to
argue
that
when
they
had
rents
are
cutback
as
they
were
cutback
under
section
131-a
to
be
low
what
new
york
state
had
described
previously
as
the
absolute
minimum
and
necessary
for
survival.
and
then
welfare
recipients
in
one
part
of
a
state
are
further
cutback
up
to
the
16%
more
of
the
16%
more
than
recipients
in
the
other
part
of
the
state.
welfare
recipients
have
something
very
vital
at
issue.
now,
that
vital
matter
may
not
result
in
the
need
for
a
special
standard
of
equal
protection.
as
this
court
noted
in
dandridge
but
it
does
require
some
sort
of
attentionality
--
attention
to
the
rationality
of
the
procedure.
and
i
think
that
issue
is
there.
the
lower
court
concluded
that
it
violated
minimum
rationality
as
well
as
special
scrutiny.
but
it
certainly
violates
the
statute.
that's
what
it
issue
here.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
yes.
i
think
and
perhaps
i
misunderstood
part
of
justice
white's
question.
i
think
these
questions
are
related.
i'll
try
to
answer
it
more
fully
now.
we
--
there
are
two
contrasting
situations.
contrasting
situations
number
one
which
is
what
we
alleged
took
place
here
is
the
creation
of
two
separate
standards
for
people
in
parts,
two
parts
of
the
state,
one
part
put
on
a
lower
basis
without
any
relation
to
actual
cost
than
another
part.
situation
number
two
which
may
also
raise
a
uniformity
question
would
arise
where
one
uniform
standard
is
created
throughout
the
state
eventhough
it
is
quite
clear
that
in
one
part
of
the
state
that
uniform
standard
is
totally
insufficient
to
meet
the
items
or
base
the
cost
the
of
items
of
basic
need
which
it
does
need
because
of
the
actual
cost
situation
in
another
part
of
the
state.
we
suggest
that
it's
consistent
with
the
principle
of
uniformity
to
average
costs
and
apply
a
uniform
standard
statewide.
hew
has
said
out
of
experience
that
costs
outside
of
rent
just
don't
really
basically
differ
within
most
states
and
therefore
some
objective
showing
would
be
made.
but
if
an
objective
showing
is
made
that
cost
really
different,
different
in
a
very
significant
extent
and
the
uniform
state
standard
is
not
arrived
at
by
an
averaging
principle
but
simply
by
taking
the
lower
place
as
the
standard
and
subjecting
the
people
who
lived
in
the
very
high
cost
place
to
that.
then
i
think
there
would
be
a
uniformity
issue
raise.
now,
your
honor
in
terms
of
the
soundness
of
the
legislative
policy
involved.
i
think
that
is
an
issue
in
the
first
instance
for
the
united
states
congress.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
with
35
years
of
a
social
security
act
which
is
administered
by
hew
has
followed
the
uniformity
principle
the
united
states
congress
may
be
said
also
to
follow
this
uniformity
principle.
and
this
principle
is
critical.
it's
critical
and
important
to
public
assistance
administration.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
this
court.
in
the
brief
said
in
the
argument,
may
i
just
this
moment
the
appellants
have
engaged
in
various
reasoning,
various
speculations
as
to
possible
differentials
between
the
cost
of
living
in
new
york
city
and
the
cost
of
living
in
the
surrounding
counties.
i
hope
to
examine
those
speculations
in
as
much
detail
as
time
permits
in
the
latter
half
of
my
argument.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
susceptible
to
precise
mathematical
proof
as
to
what
the
cost
of
living
of
objective,
what
the
cost
of
living
of
the
items
and
the
basic
needs
schedules
of
new
york's
state
are
and
new
york
city
and
in
the
surrounding
counties.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
and
to
demonstrate
that
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
we're
saying
that
in
fact,
it
is
the
same
not
inevitably
the
same.
not
at
all,
it
could
be
different
and
if
the
proof
were
and
there
are
cost
of
living
studies
conducted
all
the
time
by
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics
which
was
introduced
below
by
the
new
york
state
welfare
department
which
study
was
introduced
below
by
the
various
locals
social
service
agencies
such
as
the
new
york
city
social
service
department,
the
nassau
social
service
department,
the
westchester
social
service
department
despite
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
--
despite.
they
all
agree.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
they
all
agree
that
the
costs
of
the
basic
items
going
to
food
clothing,
furnishing
are
withdraws
that
on
furnishing.
the
schedules
of
the
local
social
service
agencies
show
that
household
furnishing
are
slightly
more
expensive
in
the
suburban
counties
than
they
are
in
the
new
york
city
area
but
there
is
a
conclusion
on
this
subject
which
appellants
have
made
and
which
is
very,
very
pertinent
to
the
question
your
honor
is
raising
with
me
and
it
was
raised
by
mr.
justice
black
a
moment
ago.
unfortunately,
this
conclusion
was
published
too
late
for
citation
in
our
brief.
this
published
in
the
103rd
annual
report
of
the
new
york
social
service
department
and
the
new
york
state
board
of
social
welfare
and
appellant
wyman
on
april
9,
1970
and
i
quote
from
page
4
of
the
appendix
to
that
brief
which
is
a
report
dated
november
21st
but
which
was
not
made
publicly
available
at
least
to
us
until
the
time
this
was
release
after
our
brief
was
written.
it
says
this
and
i
think
its
right
in
the
heart
of
the
statutory
issue
with
this
case.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
yes.
i
would
like
to
do
that
very
much
your
honor.
i'll
quote
the
relevant
two
sentences.
“we
have
considered
evidence
concerning
the
cost
of
living.”
these
are
the
appellants
speaking
in
their
103rd
report.
“we
have
considered
evidence
concerning
the
cost
of
living
in
different
regions
of
the
state
and
recommend
that
there
be
one
statewide
schedule
of
monthly
allowance
for
all
basic
items
of
need,
exclusive
of
shelter
costs.
the
evidence
presented
to
us
indicates
that
the
major
source
of
differentials
and
the
cost
of
living
and
shelter
cost
which
is
not
included
in
the
flat
grant
and
the
effect
of
variation
and
other
items
of
basic
need
for
different
regions
results
in
approximately
the
same
total
cost
of
living
for
households
comprise
of
the
same
number
of
persons
and
all
such
reasons
which
goes
considerable
beyond
our
case
because
we're
simply
talking
about
the
suburban
counties.”
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
the
legislature
so
far
as
we
can
determine
your
honor,
has
considered
no
cost
of
living
studies
whatsoever.
the
legislature
has
simply
cited
in
the
second
amended
version
of
13-a,
that
is
the
version
presently
in
effect
not
the
version
which
was
in
effect
when
the
case
began
and
not
the
version
which
will
be
in
effect
when
the
case
began
and
the
not
the
version
will
be
in
effect
on
june
1st,
when
the
rosado
they
tend
to
compliance
will
go
into
effect.
the
legislature
has
found
state
it
in
its
findings
that
finds
as
a
fact
that
the
cost
to
living
in
urban
areas
is
greater
due
to
the
higher
social
complexity
of
living
in
those
areas
due
to
the
higher
complexity
in
utilizing
programs
services
and
facilities.
this
was
the
reason,
the
reason,
given
by
appellant
wyman
to
the
court
below.
the
reason
i
would
like
to
examine
in
some
detail
because
i
think
it's
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
oh!
i
misunderstood
your
honor's
question.
the
legislature
fixed
a
statutory
scale
which
reflects
a
certain
difference
between
new
york
city
and
the
rest
of
the
region
and
then
instructed
the
commissioner,
appellant
wyman,
to
adjust
the
scale
for
the
other
regions
if
he
finds
that
the
cost
of
the
items
which
comprise
the
basic
needs
in
the
other
regions.
this
is
more
or
less
and
appellant
wyman
in
the
one
opportunity
he
had
to
act
prior
to
the
injunction
in
this
case
did
so
act.
did
narrow
the
differential
set
initially
in
the
legislative
maximums
as
he
was
permitted
by
the
legislature
but
did
not,
did
not
narrow
it
sufficiently.
he
leaves
a
7%
to
16%
gap
in
the
total
amount
of
differential
which
we
consider
is
not
slight
at
all
but
of
very,
very
serious
consequence
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
that
is
quite
a
job.
that
is
quite
a
job,
and
it's
the
very
difficult
job
and
the
evidence
indicates
the
costs
are
the
same.
there
have
been
from
the
inception
of
this
case
your
honors,
two
issues,
the
constitutional
issue
and
the
statutory
issue.
the
appellants
just
before
made
what
i
consider
the
rather
surprising
statement
that
we
were
unaware
of
the
administrative
policies
which
lead
hew
to
that
conclusion
that
it
stated
in
its
brief.
i
think
that
this
case
can
be
decided
on
the
probabilities,
that
is
the
issue
before
the
court
whether
the
preliminary
injunction
can
be
affirmed.
it
should
be
affirmed,
can
be
decided
on
the
probabilities
of
success
of
plaintiffs
in
the
statutory
argument.
and
i
think
the
reason
for
surprise
on
the
part
of
appellants'
surprises
me.
there
are
several
outstanding
features
of
this
case
with
regard
to
the
statutory
argument.
first,
there
are
three
causes
of
actions
set
forth
causes
of
action
set
forth
in
the
complaint
to
this
case.
the
first
three
deal
purely
with
statutory
ground.
secondly,
of
two
briefs
submitted
to
the
lower
court
by
the
appellees
on
the
substantive
issues
one
dealt
almost
exclusively
with
the
statutory
issue.
we
were
in
fact
had
dealt
with
it
at
some
length
the
greater
length
in
our
brief
dealt
with
it
before
this
cost
--
court.
we
were
quite
worthy
then.
third,
the
court
below
devoted
two
pages
of
its
opinion
to
the
statutory
issue.
it
didn't
conclude
on
the
statutory
issue
because
it
believes
that
its
duty
was
to
refer
to
hew
but
it
devoted
two
pages
and
what
it
is
an
obviously
sympathetic
consideration
a
plaintiff's
position.
fourth,
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
in
referring
to
hew
on
that.
i
would
conclude
on
the
basis
of
the
majority
opinion
in
rosado
that
the
lower
court
was
wrong
your
honor.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
it
should
have
considered
the
statutory
argument.
invited
hew
to
submit
an
amicus
brief
in
its
views
and
attempted
to
see
if
the
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
absolutely,
your
honor
and
i
urge
that
this
court
decide
whether
or
not
the
preliminary
injunction
should
be
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
the
statutory
issue
can
be
evaluated
at
this
stage
and
we
think
it
can.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
oh,
i
think
its
clear
your
honor.
i
think
that
he
--
in
addition
to
the
fact
as
i've
already
cited
there
is
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
i'm
not
sure
i
properly
understand
your
honor's
question.
if
what
your
honor
is
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
you
sent
it
back
for
a
remand
after
you
concluded
that
the
new
york
state
standard
of
need
as
suggested
by
131-a
violated
section
402
(a)
23.
if
you
reach
the
same
conclusion
here
with
regard
to
the
difference
that's
use
of
a
differentials
there
is
a
proper
basis
for
affirming
the
preliminary
injunction
which
was
before
the
court.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
i
think
that
in
light
of
what
the
appellants'
argument
is
that
they
have
nothing
further
to
say
on
the
statutory
issue.
you
could
finally
resolve
but
i
don't
think
you
have
to.
i
think
you
can
simply
state
that
the
--
there's
enough
probability
to
it
to
reach
conclusion.
i
know
that
the
appellants
have
stated
both
in
the
reply
brief
and
before
the
court
just
a
moment
ago
that
the
statutory
issue
is
the
same
as
the
constitutional
issue
on
equal
protection
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
well,
your
honor,
as
i
understand
their
position
which
if
i
may
have
misinterpreted
as
oral
statement
but
their
brief
is
quite
clear.
thus,
whether
that
i'm
quoting
from
page
13
of
the
reply
brief,
“thus,
whether
the
constitution,
the
social
security
act
of
the
hew
regulations
be
conceded
the
touchstone
in
any
cases
whether
the
differentials
are
arbitrary.
if
they
meet
the
test
of
rationality
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
they
cannot
reasonably
be
held
violative
of
any
--
anything
in
the
act
or
regulations.”
that
is
their
argument.
i
think
that's
an
error.
i
think
it's
quite
clear
as
we
consider
the
hew
regulations
that
one
can
arguably
meet
the
test
of
minimal
rationality
under
the
equal
protection
clause
and
not
meet
the
requirements
of
the
regulation.
i
think
that's
very
clear.
and
i
--
with
your
permission
i
would
like
to
move
on
to
a
consideration
of
the
regulation.
the
regulation
embodies
four
related
requirements
which
are
best
understood
when
considered
together.
first,
the
regulation
and
the
hew
material
require
that
the
standard
of
need,
the
standard
of
need
which
is
compose
of
both
items
of
need
and
a
money
assessment
of
those
items
of
need
that
the
standard
of
need
be
statewide.
that
is
if
the
state
is
going
to
recognize
clothing
needs
in
one
part
of
the
state,
the
recipient
is
going
to
recognized
clothing
needs
in
any
other
part
of
the
state
where
people
need
clothing.
it
must
be
statewide,
number
one.
number
two,
the
standard
--
the
money
amount
established
by
the
standard
must
be
said
on
the
basis
of
objective
facts.
that
is
an
important
part
of
the
regulatory
requirement.
number
three,
the
standard
must
be
uniformly
applied
throughout
the
state
unless
subject
the
facts
show
that
there's
actually
a
variation
in
the
cost
of
living,
in
the
cost
of
the
items
throughout
the
state.
and
number
four,
if
the
state
can't
afford
to
meet
the
full
cost
of
the
standard
of
need
because
the
maximums
because
of
insufficient
funds
any
reduction
in
meeting
that
full
standard
must
be
applied
uniformly.
the
idea
as
hew
expresses
it
in
his
handbook
is
that
recipients
with
similar
needs
wherever
they
live
in
the
state
with
similar
resources
will
get
equal
benefits.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
that's
correct.
near
the
court
injunction
that
our
argument
requires
that
the
standard
go
up
for
recipients
new
york
city
could
come
down
but
i
call
your
honor's
attention
to
the
very
consideration
you've
placed,
this
court
place
forward
in
the
rosado.
and
that
is
there
is
a
point
this
court
argued
to
an
articulation
of
the
standard
of
need
which
reflects
social
realities
and
cost
realities
throughout
the
state.
there
is
a
point
because
if
that's
going
to
be
cut
back,
at
least
the
people
of
a
state
in
the
legislature
of
the
state
should
know
how
much
cut
back
is
actually
going
and
how
far
sure
the
state
is
falling.
now
with
the
purpose
of
402
(a)
23,
i
just
suggest
to
you
that
the
state
is
free
to
cut
new
york
city
back
and
move
the
suburban
counties
up
but
it
must
do
so
on
the
basis
of
a
frankly
recognize
standard
of
need
which
is
uncommon
to
both
of
these
places
and
one
which
was
also
affected
by
402
(a)
23.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
well,
your
honor,
the
objective
findings
have
already
been
made
by
the
appellant
commissioner
in
his
report
and
they've
been
made
again,
again,
again,
again.
they
were
--
have
made
for
years
now
but
the
cost
of
these
items
are
the
same.
they
don't
have
to
meet
those
scores.
they
can
cutback.
they
can
pay
a
less
of
percentage.
but
unless
they
come
up
with
some
kind
of
objective
showing,
some
kind
of
study,
some
kind
of
consideration
of
the
actually
costs
of
these
items
which
shows
that
the
items
vary
in
one
region
or
another
or
more
or
less
than
one
figure
or
another.
they
simply
can't
state
that
new
york
city
shall
receive
this
amount
and
nassau
shall
receive
some
other
amount.
i
think
what
has
taken
place
in
this
court
in
this
case
is
that
one
of
the
appellants
have
done
and
done
clearly
in
terms
of
their
argument
is
establish
a
different
standard
of
need.
not
a
different
cost
but
a
different
standard
of
need
for
new
york
city
then
for
the
suburban
counties.
and
if
one
examines,
anyone
of
the
arguments
that
they
put
forth
that
becomes
quite
clear.
for
example,
the
primary
argument
cited
as
a
finding
by
the
legislature,
relied
on
by
the
appellant
below
is
that
there
is
a
higher
cost
of
social
living
in
new
york
city
which
requires
transportation
to
daycare
centers,
to
welfare
centers,
to
beaches,
to
museums,
to
clinics
and
so
forth.
well,
there
was
an
examination
of
appellant
wyman
on
this
question.
and
the
results
of
the
examination
made
quite
clear
what
took
place.
let
me
cite
two
of
these
issues.
question:“do
recipients
to
your
knowledge
have
a
need
for
transportation
to
the
welfare
centers
in
nassau
county?”
answer
of
appellant
wyman:
"i
should
imagine
so
on
occasion.”
question:"approximately
the
same
as
recipients
in
new
york
city?”
answer
of
appellant
wyman:"i
don't
know.”
question:"no
reason
to
believe
otherwise?”
answer:"no,
reason
to
be
otherwise.”
question:"are
you
aware
of
the
daycare
centers
for
children
in
nassau
county?”
answer:"yes.”
question:"they
are
all
--
there
are
some
and
there
are
daycare
centers
for
children
in
westchester
county?”
"yes.”
"and
for
those
people
who
need
to
use
them
are
transportation
costs
involved?”
"to
the
extent
that
the
transportation
system's
costs
more
than
new
york
city,
the
cost
is
more.
the
evidence
had
already
showed
that
the
transportation
cost
more
in
nassau?”
answer:"that
is
correct."
what
took
place
in
this
case
and
what
is
taken
place
in
this
case
is
that
the
legislature
is
seen
fit
to
declare
a
different
standard
of
need
to
provide
a
differential
which
allows
for
transportation
cost
of
some
sort
to
the
welfare
center,
to
daycare
centers,
to
beaches
in
new
york
city
and
not
to
do
that
in
nassau
and
not
to
do
that
in
yorkers,
not
to
do
that
in
poughkeepsie.
we
would
assert
on
the
equal
protection
issue
as
a
basis
of
minimal
rationality
and
i
know
to
this
court
that
the
court
below
decided
not
simply
on
the
express
special
scrutiny
standard
which
was
rejected
in
dandridge.
but
on
the
basis
of
the
minimal
rationality
test
as
well.
but
traditionally
for
protection
standard
test
as
well.
i
would
assert
that
a
test
doesn't
make
sense
on
the
basis
of
any
common
relation
to
experience
to
assert
that
the
mother
in
yorkers
or
the
mother
in
nassau
who
has
to
pay
more
to
get
her
kids
to
a
beach
or
to
get
to
the
welfare
center
itself
or
to
get
to
a
daycare
center
should
receive
nothing
while
an
allowance
is
provided
for
the
mothers
in
new
york
city
doesn't
make
sense
but
the
point
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
well,
your
honor
this
court
noted
in
rosado
that
speculation
is
the
mode
this
to
be
in
shown
and
i
would
not
engage
in
speculation
as
to
motive
but
i
would
sight
the
brief
for
appellants
on
this
issue.
and
i
would
call
your
attention
to
page

mr.
edward
v.

mr.
edward
v.
sparer
of
the
brief
for
appellants.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
what
appellants
argue
with
that
point
is
that
the
system
created
under
the
section
131-a
is
kind
of
analogous
to
a
matching
grand
program
since
welfare
county
officials
are
empowered
to
make
application
for
increase
amounts
on
the
approval
of
the
appropriate
legislative
body.
they
go
on
to
state
this
which
is
really
at
the
heart
of
the
problem
in
this
case.
they
go
on
to
state
that
this
demonstrates
the
state
legislature's
concern
for
the
ability
to
pay
of
various
welfare
districts
and
stay
would
be
required
to
pay
one
quarter
of
any
increase
over
the
establish
levels.
i
think
that
what's
going
on
this
case
your
honor.
i
think
they're
right
in
what
they
say
there
that
the
legislature
was
concern
with
the
ability
of
upstate
localities
to
pay
their
one
quarter
of
the
welfare
share.
if
one
looks
into
the
hew
regulations
and
the
hew
materials
that
problem
is
exactly
the
problem
which
the
uniformity
regulations
are
aimed
at
and
were
aimed
that
from
1935
on.
it's
a
very
old
regulation
we're
talking
about
here
and
the
reason
they
were
aimed
at
this
problem
from
1935
on
is
that
the
general
characteristic
of
public
welfare
in
the
united
states
prior
to
the
social
security
acts
passage
in
1935
was
that
each
local
county
throughout
the
state
paid
exactly
what
they
please
whether
they
pay
full
need,
half
need,
no
need,
a
variation
was
absolutely
enormous.
this
was
one
of
the
major
problems.
the
reason
of
variation
was
enormous
was
that
welfare
standards
were
dependent
upon
the
localities
willingness
to
raise
the
taxes
in
many
localities
a
great
problems
as
hew's
properly
interpreted
the
requirement
that
the
states
financially
participate
in
each
locality
throughout
the
state
that
requirement
means
that
the
state
must
financially
participate
through
the
extent
necessary
to
relieve
a
locality
of
any
problem
it
has
in
meeting
a
uniform
schedule.
the
state
must
put
in
enough
money
to
make
sure
that
a
uniform
schedule
was
met.
now,
if
new
york
state
is
permitted
to
retreat
on
this
issue
will
allow
localities
to
have
a
local
--
to
have
a
lower
standard
because
of
the
problems
they
have
in
raising
taxes
and
new
york
has
decided
that
they
cannot
pay
one
quarter
of
the
total
share.
we
are
taking
a
very
long
step
back
to
the
pre-1935
situation.
this
is
what
motivated
the
hew
regulation.
this
is
the
real
interest
of
welfare
recipients
in
this
case
throughout
the
country
and
i
would
argue
in
answer,
mr.
justice
stewart
to
your
question.
don't
you
think
the
legislature
knows
better
than
we?
the
legislature
may
or
may
not
know
the
local
condition
that
if
than
anyone
else.
i
don't
think
this
case
raises
that
issue.
i
think
this
case
raises
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
legislature
has
in
fact
created
disparate
standard
of
need
of
these
localities
because
of
their
financial
problems
and
that
is
what's
taken
place.
it
is
exactly
what's
taken
place.
if
you
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
25.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
25%.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
which
is
a
--
throughout
the
state
another
25%
federal
government
about
50.
those
are
approximate
figures.
at
25%
is
considerable
figure.
that's
not
the
way
the
system
works
throughout
the
united
states
but
in
those
states
where
the
localities
have
to
pay
a
large
share
of
the
local
welfare
burden,
welfare
is
a
very
hot
and
difficult
political
issue.
it
just
follows
as
day
follows
night,
and
night
follows
day.
the
same
problem,
your
honor,
with
regard
to
the
creation
of
a
different
standard
of
need
is
seen
when
we
consider
any
of
the
other
arguments
asserted
by
appellants.
for
example,
the
rent
control
argument,
what
do
they
say
here?
they
say
that,
does
rent
control
in
new
york
and
not
in
some
of
other
counties
but
of
course
there
is
but
let's
assume
that's
accurate.
therefore,
there's
lower
rent
in
new
york
city
than
some
of
other
counties.
therefore,
the
amount
of
money
given
in
the
special
rent
grants
to
new
york
city
welfare
recipients
is
last
than
that
given
to
welfare
recipients
in
the
other
counties.
therefore
it's
proper
for
the
legislature
to
make
this
up
to
new
york
city
recipients
to
some
extent
so
that
they
can
buy
some
other
things
by
giving
them
a
little
extra
money.
this
is
said
right
on
the
bottom
in
their
brief.
they
make
no
bones
about
it
in
their
reply
brief.
initially,
it
seems
we
misunderstood
their
argument
in
their
reply
brief.
they
come
right
back
and
say,
we
misunderstood
what
they're
saying,
does
lower
rents
within
the
new
york
city
area
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
page
11
of
appellant's
reply
brief,
at
the
very
top.
thus,
lower
rents
within
new
york
city
directly
result
in
a
lower
standard
of
need
and
higher
rents
outside
the
city.
in
the
highest
standard
of
need
compensating
for
the
slightly
higher
allowance
within
the
city
with
components
of
the
standard
of
need
other
than
rents.
now,
they
start
with
the
fact
that
rents
are
paid
especially
according
to
actual
need
in
that
part
of
a
basic
need
requirements
which
is
what
at
issue
in
this
case.
then
they
state
that
we
give
more
rent
because
the
people
upstate
have
more
of
a
rent
need
so
they
give
more
money
which
goes
into
rent.
and
then
they
state
will
give
some
extra
to
new
york
city,
so
that
they
can
buy
some
other
things,
but
that's
establishing
a
different
standard
of
need
for
new
york
city.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
no,
your
honor.
not
in
the
way
you
phrase
the
question.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
i
would
phrase
the
question
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
well,
taking
my
statement
of
facts
your
honor,
i'd
rephrase
the
question
this
way.
i
would
say
that
if
what
new
york
state
has
done
is
average
out
the
costs
of
rent
throughout
the
state.
average
out
the
cost
of
all
these
other
basic
need
items
and
presented
one
average
sum
to
the
people
of
new
york
state
that
would
not
deny
equal
protection
even
those
some
benefited
more
and
some
benefited
less.
but
i
would
state
that
when
new
york
state
decides
that
it's
going
to
pay
rent
and
especially,
so
that
everybody
has
their
full
rent
needs
pay.
and
then
it's
going
to
take
another
sum
and
meet
other
basic
needs.
and
then
it's
going
to
pay
up
to
16%
more
to
people
in
new
york
city
because
they
don't
have
as
much
money
to
pay
rent
which
they
don't
need
to
pay
rent.
then
there's
something
--
there's
something
irrational
about
that
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
yes.
the
rational
basis
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
oh,
yes.
well,
it's
not
anymore
precise
as
precise.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
the
commissioner
has
average
figures,
who
are
they
paid
for
rent
to
welfare
recipients
in
new
york
city
and
elsewhere
which
they
referred
to.
if
they
wanted
to
pay
those
average
figures
that
would
be
fine.
they've
chosen
not
to
and
that's
fine
too.
they've
chosen
to
pay
the
exact
amount
of
rent
and
that's
fine.
that
doesn't
raise
any
equal
protection
questions.
all
we
argue
is
that
haven't
chosen
one
method
or
other
to
pay
rent
to
then
state
to
the
people
upstate
that
because
you
have
a
higher
cost
than
people
in
new
york
city
have,
we're
going
to
give
the
people
of
new
york
city
16%
more
to
buy
things
which
we're
not
allowing
you
to
buy
because
we're
not
giving
you
any
money
to
buy
him
with.
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
at
all.
now,
as
i
argue
your
honor,
this
court
need
not
reach
that
question
in
terms
of
equal
protection,
that's
a
question
of
judgment
as
to
rationality
and
whether
how
much
difference
is
going
to
be
given
to
the
legislative
judgment
on
this.
in
terms
of
the
statutory
requirement
of
statewideness,
the
violation
is
clearly.
it
could
not
be
clearer.
it
is
--
the
problem
i
think
on
appellant's
part
occurs
because
they
confused
the
standard
of
minimum
rationality
for
equal
protection
and
the
standard
under
the
hew
requirements
of
uniformity.
they
confuse
them
badly
and
therefore
don't
address
in
reality
the
standard
of
uniformity.
i
would
conclude
your
honor
that
we
could
engage
in
the
same
process
as
we
have
in
our
briefs
with
regard
to
every
one
of
the
arguments
raised
by
appellants.
but
i
would
conclude
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
statewide,
yes.
unless
there's
a
variation
in
the
cause
which
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
in
the
cause.
yes.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
yes.
now
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
as
i
understand
it,
the
united
states'
position
which
will
be
exploit
by
the
united
states
shortly
is
this.
first,
they
have
established
a
different
standard
for
new
york
city
because
they
are
allowing
a
different
kind
of
position
in
there.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
that
is
our
position,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
the
different
standard
is
that
they
are
allowing
by
their
own
language.
monies
for
transportation
to
daycare
centers,
to
social
welfare
centers,
and
so
forth,
the
people
of
new
york
city
which
they're
not
allowing
elsewhere.
even
though
by
their
own
testimony,
the
people
elsewhere
have
those
very
same
needs.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
well,
the
--
the
principle
of
standard
of
need
allows
as
hew
sets
forth
in
the
three
simplified
methods
allows
the
states
to
combine
a
wide
variety
of
items.
in
the
past,
new
york
did
not
combine,
it
listed
individually.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
now,
it
combines.
but
those
combined
items
reflect
particular
matters.
they
give
one
overall
sum
for
that.
and
what
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
you
could
increase
the
standard
on
the
showing
that
shirts
get
dirty
in
new
york
city.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
you
could
increase
the
standard
for
new
york
city,
yes.
the
standard
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
the
standard.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
or
you
could
create
a
special
need
allowance
for
laundry
which
is
allowed
under
hew
regulations
in
which
you
pretty
much
use
to
be
the
case
in
new
york
city.
the
only
point
which
is
relevant
about
that
that
i
see
to
this
case
is
that
if
you
create
a
special
allowance
for
laundry.
let's
say
$10.00
a
month
maximum
depended
on
how
much
need
do
you
actually
have
to
wash
shirts
for
a
month
long.
you
have
to
apply
that
statewide
so
that
people
who
live
in
buffalo
and
working
in
or
near
or
live
near
a
steel
mill
in
buffalo
will
also
happen
to
have
that
same
need
can
also
get
the
shirts
washed.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
if
you
don't
have
it
on
nassau
county
unless
it
can
be
shown
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
pardon
me?
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
well,
i
--
i
know
you're
not
interested
in
laundry
cost
in
particularly
--
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
i
think
welfare
recipients
can
and
ought
to
be
in
a
position
to
argue
that
when
they
had
rents
are
cutback
as
they
were
cutback
under
section
131-a
to
be
low
what
new
york
state
had
described
previously
as
the
absolute
minimum
and
necessary
for
survival.
and
then
welfare
recipients
in
one
part
of
a
state
are
further
cutback
up
to
the
16%
more
of
the
16%
more
than
recipients
in
the
other
part
of
the
state.
welfare
recipients
have
something
very
vital
at
issue.
now,
that
vital
matter
may
not
result
in
the
need
for
a
special
standard
of
equal
protection.
as
this
court
noted
in
dandridge
but
it
does
require
some
sort
of
attentionality
--
attention
to
the
rationality
of
the
procedure.
and
i
think
that
issue
is
there.
the
lower
court
concluded
that
it
violated
minimum
rationality
as
well
as
special
scrutiny.
but
it
certainly
violates
the
statute.
that's
what
it
issue
here.
mr.
edward
v.
sparer
yes.
i
think
and
perhaps
i
misunderstood
part
of
justice
white's
question.
i
think
these
questions
are
related.
i'll
try
to
answer
it
more
fully
now.
we
--
there
are
two
contrasting
situations.
contrasting
situations
number
one
which
is
what
we
alleged
took
place
here
is
the
creation
of
two
separate
standards
for
people
in
parts,
two
parts
of
the
state,
one
part
put
on
a
lower
basis
without
any
relation
to
actual
cost
than
another
part.
situation
number
two
which
may
also
raise
a
uniformity
question
would
arise
where
one
uniform
standard
is
created
throughout
the
state
eventhough
it
is
quite
clear
that
in
one
part
of
the
state
that
uniform
standard
is
totally
insufficient
to
meet
the
items
or
base
the
cost
the
of
items
of
basic
need
which
it
does
need
because
of
the
actual
cost
situation
in
another
part
of
the
state.
we
suggest
that
it's
consistent
with
the
principle
of
uniformity
to
average
costs
and
apply
a
uniform
standard
statewide.
hew
has
said
out
of
experience
that
costs
outside
of
rent
just
don't
really
basically
differ
within
most
states
and
therefore
some
objective
showing
would
be
made.
but
if
an
objective
showing
is
made
that
cost
really
different,
different
in
a
very
significant
extent
and
the
uniform
state
standard
is
not
arrived
at
by
an
averaging
principle
but
simply
by
taking
the
lower
place
as
the
standard
and
subjecting
the
people
who
lived
in
the
very
high
cost
place
to
that.
then
i
think
there
would
be
a
uniformity
issue
raise.
now,
your
honor
in
terms
of
the
soundness
of
the
legislative
policy
involved.
i
think
that
is
an
issue
in
the
first
instance
for
the
united
states
congress.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
with
35
years
of
a
social
security
act
which
is
administered
by
hew
has
followed
the
uniformity
principle
the
united
states
congress
may
be
said
also
to
follow
this
uniformity
principle.
and
this
principle
is
critical.
it's
critical
and
important
to
public
assistance
administration.
