justice
potter
stewart
halved,
h-a-l-v-e-d?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
differentials
are
between
new
york
city
on
the
one
hand
and
all
the
rest
of
the
state
on
the
other?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
all
the
rest
of
the
state
is
now
treated
equally
by
statute
subject
only
as
i
understand
it
to
the
discretion
to
increase
it
up
to
a
maximum
of
what
new
york
city
pays.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
used
to
be
--
it's
used
to
be
three
areas
in
new
york
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
i
understand
it
before
this
present
legislation.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
done
by
--
and
it
was
done
by
regulation.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
there
are
two
under
the
statute
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
new
york
city
and
the
rest
of
the
state.
those
two
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
so
--
justice
potter
stewart
another
shelter
as
well
as
the
heat,
fuel,
oil
or
whatever
heat
they
used?
justice
potter
stewart
gets
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
necessarily
because
it
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
shelter
and
heat
isn't
dissipates
effort.
justice
potter
stewart
for
now
let's
assume
mr.
weinberg
that
you're
quite
right
and
that
base
on
the
factors
that
you've
been
discussing
and
others.
we
have
left
the
equal
protection
clause
far
behind
particularly
in
light
of
the
--
this
court's
recent
decision
in
the
dandridge
case.
we
still
--
we're
not
--
that
doesn't
get
you
out
of
the
woods
in
this
case,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
statutory
ground
and
you
have
the
amicus
brief
filed
here
by
the
secretary
of
hew,
telling
us
that
the
statutory
ground
is
a
good
ground.
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
i
trust
you
are
going
to.
justice
potter
stewart
we're
dealing
here
with
the
preliminary
injunction
are
we?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
the
--
it
should
be
--
if
we
should
think
you're
mistaken
and
that
the
preliminary
injunction
should
remain
in
the
effect
and
that
would
be
followed
by
a
plenary
hearing.
and
the
purpose
of
which
would
be
decide
that
whether
or
not
they
ought
to
be
a
permanent
injunction
or
no
injunction
at
all,
would
that
be
true?
justice
potter
stewart
how
at
all
--
how
are
these
facts
get
in?
there's
an
affidavit
or
deposition?
justice
potter
stewart
but
do
you
think
the
new
york
legislature
might
know
a
little
bit
more
about
that
than
maybe
nothing
you
do
that
--
but
than
most
of
us
do?
justice
potter
stewart
of
what?
justice
potter
stewart
of
what?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
the
local
with
county
has
to
raise
what
percentage?
justice
potter
stewart
25%.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
state,
the
others
reported.
justice
potter
stewart
where
are
you
reading
from,
mr.
sparer?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don’t
quite
understand
ultimately
what
it
is
that
you
submit
that
the
federal
statute
requires
in
the
way
of
uniformity.
i
gather
you
--
the
claim
as
that
it
requires
a
--
the
same
--
that
the
same
criteria
they
used
in
establishing
the
standard
of
need
throughout
the
states,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
new
york
city,
for
example
there
are
subways,
that’s
the
way
people
get
back
and
forth
and
every
--
anybody,
most
people
who
live
uptown
or
work
downtown,
live
in
harlem,
work
in
midtown
have
to
use
those
subways
and
as
in
a
little
town
up
right
alexandria
bay,
you
walk.
i
don’t
see
how
this
can
be
worked
out
uniformly
because
there
is
a
need
for
a
service
in
new
york
city
that
does
not
exist
in
redwood
or
alexandria
bay.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
new
york
city
is
the
only
city
in
the
state
that
has
a
subway
system
and
where
that
the
people
have
to
use
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
what
is
the
--
which
system
has
been
followed
in
maryland
and
dandridge
against
williams.
although
[voice
overlap]
i
remember
had
a
maximum
of
250
months,
and
the
rest
of
state
240?
justice
potter
stewart
are
staff
discussions
still
going
on
in
this
case
between
the
staff
of
hew
and
the
appropriate
authorities
in
new
york
state?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
doesn’t
answer
my
question.
you
say
that
in
your
brief,
but
then
you
say
staff
discussions
have
not
yielded
at
any
acceptable
showing
to
support
the
difference
and
that
was
your
brief
on
file
earlier
this
month
which
implies
the
staff
discussions
have
taken
place,
are
they
still
going
on?
justice
potter
stewart
halved,
h-a-l-v-e-d?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice

the
