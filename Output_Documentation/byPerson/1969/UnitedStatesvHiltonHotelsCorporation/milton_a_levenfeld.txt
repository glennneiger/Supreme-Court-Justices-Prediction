mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
concedes
that
total
expenses
in
the
appraisal
proceedings
are
deductible
under
section
162
if
they
are
not
capital
cost.
my
argument
will
be
first
directed
to
demonstrate
that
the
government's
contention
is
erroneous
because
the
legal
contractual
and
economic
position
of
the
dissenting
shareholders
changed
from
that
of
stockholders
to
creditors
when
they
objected
to
the
merger
and
demanded
payment
for
their
stock.
i
will
then
show
that
the
merger
and
the
appraisal
proceedings
were
not
functionally
related,
so
that
rules
with
respect
to
mergers
are
not
applicable
to
the
appraisal
proceeding.
underlying
both
arguments
will
be
an
analysis
of
state
law
because
without
section
analysis,
one
does
not
know
whether
an
acquisition
has
occurred.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
the
occasion
for
this
expense
was
not
the
merger
itself,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
occasion
for
the
expense
was
the
objection
and
demand
for
payment
by
the
dissenters
and
the
failure
to
agree
on
price.
the
merger
would
have
been
effective
in
any
event
assuming
two-thirds.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
the
acquisition
--
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
--
was
not
by
hilton,
your
honor.
the
acquisition
was
by
waldorf.
the
stock
ceased
to
be
outstanding
stock
of
waldorf
at
the
date
of
the
objection
and
demand
for
payment.
hilton
was
not
acquiring
the
stock.
at
the
time
of
the
objection
and
demand
for
payment,
the
new
york
statute
specifically
provides
that
the
dissenters
ceased
to
be
shareholders.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
hilton
was
the
surviving
corporation.
but
prior
to
the
merger
upon
the
dissent,
the
dissenting
shareholders
headed
dissent
prior
to
devote
for
the
merger.
prior
to
the
merger,
they
became
creditors
of
waldorf.
hilton
assumed
the
liability
of
waldorf
as
a
debtor
to
the
dissenters
by
operation
of
lot
upon
the
merger.
hilton
did
not
pay
in
its
stock
for
the
dissenting
shareholders'
stock.
there
was
a
change
of
status
for
the
dissenting
shareholders
from
that
of
stockholder
to
that
of
creditor.
the
only
evidence
pertinent
in
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
evidence
as
to
values
of
shares
of
the
shares
of
dissenting
shareholders.
there
was
no
evidence
introduced
or
which
could
be
introduced
as
to
the
value
of
the
hilton
shares
or
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
merger.
a
debtor-creditor
relationship
was
established
between
the
dissenters
and
waldorf
and
the
debt
of
waldorf
was
assumed
by
hilton
by
operation
of
law
on
the
merger.
the
relationship
of
debtor
and
creditor
is
established
amply
by
the
state
law
and
case
law
citations
in
our
brief.
after
the
demand
for
payment
in
the
objection
to
merger,
the
dissenters
have
none
of
the
attributes
of
stock
ownership.
under
state
law,
they
could
not
vote
on
any
matter
relating
to
waldorf
or
hilton.
they
could
receive
no
dividends
by
waldorf
or
hilton.
they
could
receive
no
liquidation
proceeds.
in
addition,
it
has
been
decided
that
by
the
federal
court
that
once
a
dissenter
elects
to
receive
payment
for
the
stock,
he
cannot
bring
a
derivative
suit
in
a
capacity
as
shareholder
even
while
the
appraisal
proceedings
is
in
progress.
in
addition,
the
dissenters
had
all
the
attributes
of
sellers
of
stock,
entitled
to
receive
payment
for
stock.
they
became
creditors
of
waldorf
and
then
hilton.
had
hilton
become
a
bankrupt,
they
would
have
been
entitled
to
receive
distributions
from
the
hilton
as
general
creditors
paired
to
pursue
with
other
general
creditors
prior
to
any
distribution
to
the
stockholders
of
hilton.
in
addition,
this
was
held
in
southern
production
company
versus
samoth
cited
in
our
brief.
in
addition,
the
dissenters
would
have
been
entitled
to
the
federal
protection
of
sec
rule
10(b)
relating
to
full
disclosure
with
respect
to
the
merger
because
they
would
have
been
considered
sellers
of
stock.
in
this
protection,
what
have
been
afforded
to
them
even
while
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
in
progress.
this
was
cited
--
this
was
decided
in
the
bouge
case
cited
in
our
brief.
as
prior
counsels
brought
out,
this
court
in
apsey
versus
kimball,
221
u.s.
would
have
decided
had
waldorf
been
a
banking
corporation
and
had
its
shareholders
been
subject
to
additional
liability,
this
court
decided
that
such
additional
liability
could
not
yet
been
imposed
upon
dissenters
who
had
elected
appraisal
rights.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
the
--
as
i
read
the
statute,
mr.
justice
white
the
stock
became
treasury
stock
and
waldorf
was
obligated
to
pay
for
it
at
its
fair
value.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
that
is
conceding
capital
expenditures.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
i
concede
that
your
honor
because
of
the
fact
that
it
was
unnecessary
for
hilton
to
exchange
the
one
in
a
quarter
shares
for
this
shares
that
has
ceased
to
become
outstanding
shares
of
waldorf.
it
was
the
purchase
price
--
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
my
point,
your
honor,
is
that
miscellaneous
expenses
are
not
connected
with
the
acquisition.
there
is
no
functional
relationship
between
the
acquisitions
and
these
expenditures.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
functional
relationship.
my
point
is
--
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
it
wasn't
that,
it
was
because
we
could
not
agree
on
price
that
we
incurred
these
expenditures.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
we
have
already
inquired
the
stock,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
we
could
not
back
out
if
nor
could
have
the
dissenting
shareholders.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
we
know
that
if
they
did
exercise
their
rights
we
would
have
had
to
buy
the
stock.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
absent
the
creation
of
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
waldorf
assumed
by
hilton
to
pay
for
the
stock,
the
appraisal
procedure
expenses
would
not
have
been
made.
the
dissenters,
when
they
dissented
and
demanded
payment,
elected
to
share
their
shares
under
terms
set
forth
by
the
state
of
new
york
in
its
statutes.
the
state
of
new
york
determined
who
the
parties
to
the
sale
were,
the
number
of
shares
to
be
sold
and
the
date
of
the
sale.
in
the
state
of
new
york
by
statute
also
determined
the
purchase
price
of
the
shares.
the
state
of
new
york
determined
that
the
purchase
price
of
the
shares
was
the
value
of
the
shares
on
the
day
before
the
meeting
of
waldorf
approving
the
merger.
neither
party,
neither
the
dissenters
nor
hilton
could
vary
the
price
to
be
paid
by
the
sharers,
for
the
sharers.
this
is
somewhat
similar
to
the
situation
keiselbach
versus
commission
317
u.s.
where
this
court
said
that
the
purchase
price
in
a
condemnation
proceeding
is
settled
as
of
the
date
the
property
was
taken.
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
not
part
of
an
acquisition
process
because
the
parties
were
not
negotiating
as
to
mutually
acceptable
terms
as
a
condition
to
sale.
this
is
not
analogous
to
try
to
finding
a
buyer
by
paying
broker
a
commission
nor
is
it
analogous
to
the
parties
bargaining
as
a
condition
to
sale
as
to
purchase
price.
without
an
agreement
as
to
purchase
price
there
would
have
been
no
sale
in
the
ordinary
circumstance.
in
this
circumstance
the
purchase
price
had
been
imposed
upon
by
the
state
and
the
sale
that
have
been
imposed
upon
the
party
by
the
state
once
the
election
was
made.
this
is
not
in
any
way
analogous
to
an
attorney
preparing
documents
to
consummate
a
sale,
without
the
signing
of
which
there
would
be
no
sale.
this
was
a
complete
sale
not
subject
to
renegotiation
by
either
party
to
the
sale.
the
dissenters
could
not
unilaterally
cancel
their
consent
and
resume
their
status
as
shareholders
of
hilton.
they
were
in
the
same
precision
as
a
private
seller
who
had
sold
his
stock
and
in
a
deferred
payment
and
the
payment
could
either
been
a
fixed
purchased
price
or
a
formula
purchase
price
or
a
price
to
be
determined
by
an
objective
standard
such
as
a
state
of
new
york
in
this
case
said
it
would
be
the
objective
standard
being
fair
value.
after
the
demand
for
payment,
the
shareholders,
the
dissenters
had
no
interest
in
waldorf
as
shareholders.
they
were
not
interested
in
whether
the
price
of
waldorf
stock
when
up
or
down
and
they
were
not
interested
whether
the
price
of
hilton
stock
went
up
or
down.
they
had
ceased
to
have
any
interest
as
equity
owner
and
merely
were
creditors.
this
reflects
--
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
i
will
think
your
honor
that
that
is
part
of
the
agreement
as
to
purchase
price
prior
to
the
consummation
of
the
sale.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
but
they
have
agreed
that
it
will
be
what
is
to
be
determined
by
the
third
party.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
i
think
the
answer
is
it
probably
would
be
a
capital
expense.
the
public
policy
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
this
appears
to
be
very
correct
because
if
the
waldorf
dissenters
could
resume
their
status
of
shareholders
and
hilton
stock
were
to
go
higher,
they
could
have
taken
advantage
of
the
increase
in
price
of
hilton
stock
while
in
any
event
having
a
downward
protection
because
of
hilton
stock
went
lower,
they
could
always
have
their
demand
for
the
fair
value
of
their
stock.
the
fact
of
the
--
dissenters
did
not
have
this
choice,
demonstrates
once
again
that
they
were
in
the
position
not
as
shareholders
when
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
commenced
but
as
creditors
and
the
purpose
of
the
appraisal
proceedings
was
to
determine
the
amount
owed
to
them
as
creditor.
in
summary,
on
this
point
the
dissenters
had
sold
their
stock
on
the
date
they
objected
to
the
merger
and
demanded
payment
for
their
stock.
they
have
no
claim
against
waldorf
or
hilton
as
share
holders
and
they
had
only
the
right
to
receive
payment
and
all
of
these
events
had
occurred
prior
to
the
appraisal
proceeding.
the
appraisal
proceeding
could
in
no
way
affect
the
acquisition.
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
not
an
equitable
proceeding
to
revise
or
modify
the
terms
of
a
sale
and
it
was
not
necessary
to
achieve
an
enforceable
bargain
because
an
enforceable
bargain
had
been
imposed
by
the
state
of
new
york.
it
was
also
not
necessary
to
achieve
the
essential
formalities
of
sale
because
those
formalities
were
taken
cared
of
by
law
and
it
was
not
necessary
to
establish
acceptable
terms
of
acquisition
because
the
terms
of
acquisition
had
been
imposed
by
law.
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
not
part
of
the
cost
of
acquisition
because
shares
were
acquired
prior
there
to
and
the
appraisal
proceeding
had
no
effect
on
the
acquisition.
title
involvement
has
always
been
a
necessary
element
to
determine
whether
an
item
is
to
be
capitalized
as
being
part
of
the
cost
of
acquisition,
perfection
or
defense
of
title
because
one
cannot
acquire
a
title
or
acquire
anything
without
title
being
involved.
title
involvement
its
necessary
touchstone
is
absent
from
the
appraisal
proceeding
because
title
to
shares
of
stock
of
the
dissenters
had
from
them
long
before
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
started.
most
of
the
government
cases
sighting
the
application
of
the
windmill
rationale
involved
title,
so
the
cases
cited
by
the
governments
are
clearly
not
applicable
and
if
the
cases
didn't
involve
title,
they
involved
the
recasting
of
sales
price
by
a
court
with
respect
to
a
sale
induced
by
fraud.
again,
a
bargaining
process
or
the
cases
involved
the
reaching
of
agreement
by
as
to
price
prior
to
title
being
passed
or
the
cases
involved
taking
the
necessary
steps
to
consummate
the
sale.
the
more
appropriate
cases
as
authority
for
this
case
is
a
case
of
petrick
decided
by
the
second
circuit
involving
a
confiscation
proceeding.
in
that
case,
the
taxpayers'
property
was
confiscated
by
a
foreign
government
and
the
proceeding
determining
the
award
was
based
upon
the
value
of
the
property
confiscated.
there
the
second
circuit
held
at
the
legal
cost
in
the
proceeding
were
deductible.
another
relevant
cases
the
naylor
case
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit.
in
that
case
an
option
was
exercised
to
purchase
stocks
and
the
parties
agreed
that
title
had
passed
but
the
option
price
was
set
at
the
book
value
of
the
shares
of
stock
at
a
certain
date
and
the
taxpayer
hired
an
attorney
because
a
dispute
arose
as
to
book
value.
the
attorney's
fees
were
held
to
be
deductible
because
title
had
passed
before
the
attorney
was
hired
and
he
was
hired
merely
to
collect
the
correct
amount
of
the
purchase
price
which
was
a
standard
set
by
agreement
among
the
parties'
book
value.
the
government's
reliance
upon
titled
cases
is
misplaced
and
rather
the
petrick
case
and
the
naylor
case
are
more
appropriate.
the
government
contends
that
the
origin
and
character
of
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
in
the
merger.
essentially,
the
argument
is
had
there
been
no
merger,
there
be
appraisal
proceeding.
but
the
cause
of
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
not
the
merger.
the
cause
of
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
in
the
objection
and
demand
for
payment
by
the
dissenters,
had
there
been
no
such
objection
or
demand
for
payment
there
would
be
no
appraisal
proceeding.
the
merger
had
been
completed
and
the
dissenters
could
not
affect
the
merger.
the
acquisition
of
the
dissenters'
stock
had
been
completed
and
the
dissenters
could
not
affect
such
acquisition.
it
was
not
from
the
merger
or
as
a
part
of
the
acquisition
that
the
appraisal
proceeding
arose
but
it
wasn't
a
debtor-creditor
relationship
established
between
the
dissenters
in
waldorf
and
the
fact
that
they
could
not
agree
on
the
fair
value
of
the
dissenters'
shares.
there
was
no
functional
relationship
between
the
appraisal
proceeding
and
the
merger
and
the
rules
with
respect
to
mergers
should
not
apply.
the
government
states
that
distinctions
in
state
law
should
not
govern
federal
tax
consequences
and
the
government
in
its
brief
cites
cases
where
there
was
no
substantive
difference
in
state
law
or
where
state
law
put
different
labels
on
the
same
property
rights
as
authority
for
the
statement.
however,
we
all
know
that
in
private
contracts
trying
to
accomplish
similar
ends,
different
tax
consequences
can
depend
upon
title.
there
is
one
case
in
the
lower
courts
other
than
woodward
in
which
the
appraisal
proceedings
were
held
and
to
be
deductible.
this
is
a
district
court
case
boulder
building
corporation
and
it
was
decided
under
the
appraisals
statute
at
18
oklahoma
statutes
annotated
1.161(a)
1953.
i
will
quote
this
statute
to
you.
“holders
of
dissenting
shares
of
a
domestic
corporation
shall
continue
to
have
all
the
rights
and
privileges
incident
to
their
shares
except
just
expressly
limited
by
this
section
until
such
time
is
a
fair
value
of
such
shares
be
agreed
upon
or
determined
by
judgment.”
there
were
no
appraisable
limitations
under
this
section.
i
submit
that
under
the
oklahoma
statutes,
the
dissenters
remain
shareholders
and
they
could
have
resumed
their
status
shareholders
which
is
entirely
different
in
the
state
law
in
new
york
when
they
had
forever
lost
their
status
as
shareholders.
the
government
says,
ignore
title
when
you
decide
this
case
but
one
must
always
be
concerned
with
title
if
one
is
going
to
impose
capitalization
because
the
title
acquisition
is
involved.
hilton
does
not
urge
the
use
of
the
primary
purpose
test
in
this
case
because
the
sole
purpose
of
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
to
determine
the
value
of
the
shares,
the
amount
of
the
debt
owed
by
hilton
and
there
was
no
element
of
title
involved
in
the
appraisal
proceeding.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
your
honor,
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
between
setting
a
price
and
paying
a
price.
we
have
agreed,
hilton
had
agreed
to
pay
a
price.
it
was
a
price
that
was
imposed
upon
it
by
state
law
and
the
state
law
had
evolved
a
procedure
to
determine
the
price.
we
are
questioning
--
the
problem
we
have
is
to
categorize
the
expenses
in
determining
the
price.
there
is
no
question
that
the
price
itself
was
for
an
acquisition
yet
title
was
not
involved
in
the
price
determination
proceeding.
the
title
was
involved
in
the
acquisition
which
had
incurred
for
the
price
determining
proceeding.
in
summary,
the
expenses
of
hilton
in
the
appraisal
proceeding
should
not
be
capitalized
because
title
was
not
involved
in
the
appraisal
proceeding
and
hilton
acquired
nothing
as
a
result
of
the
appraisal
proceeding.
in
addition,
the
appraisal
proceeding
having
resulted
from
the
demand
for
payment
and
the
inability
for
the
debtor
and
creditor
to
agree
in
price
was
not
functionally
related
to
the
merger,
so
the
merger
rules
should
not
apply.
it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
those
expenses
in
the
appraisal
proceeding
are
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
deductible
under
section
162
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
thank
you.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
concedes
that
total
expenses
in
the
appraisal
proceedings
are
deductible
under
section
162
if
they
are
not
capital
cost.
my
argument
will
be
first
directed
to
demonstrate
that
the
government's
contention
is
erroneous
because
the
legal
contractual
and
economic
position
of
the
dissenting
shareholders
changed
from
that
of
stockholders
to
creditors
when
they
objected
to
the
merger
and
demanded
payment
for
their
stock.
i
will
then
show
that
the
merger
and
the
appraisal
proceedings
were
not
functionally
related,
so
that
rules
with
respect
to
mergers
are
not
applicable
to
the
appraisal
proceeding.
underlying
both
arguments
will
be
an
analysis
of
state
law
because
without
section
analysis,
one
does
not
know
whether
an
acquisition
has
occurred.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
the
occasion
for
this
expense
was
not
the
merger
itself,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
occasion
for
the
expense
was
the
objection
and
demand
for
payment
by
the
dissenters
and
the
failure
to
agree
on
price.
the
merger
would
have
been
effective
in
any
event
assuming
two-thirds.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
the
acquisition
--
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
--
was
not
by
hilton,
your
honor.
the
acquisition
was
by
waldorf.
the
stock
ceased
to
be
outstanding
stock
of
waldorf
at
the
date
of
the
objection
and
demand
for
payment.
hilton
was
not
acquiring
the
stock.
at
the
time
of
the
objection
and
demand
for
payment,
the
new
york
statute
specifically
provides
that
the
dissenters
ceased
to
be
shareholders.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
hilton
was
the
surviving
corporation.
but
prior
to
the
merger
upon
the
dissent,
the
dissenting
shareholders
headed
dissent
prior
to
devote
for
the
merger.
prior
to
the
merger,
they
became
creditors
of
waldorf.
hilton
assumed
the
liability
of
waldorf
as
a
debtor
to
the
dissenters
by
operation
of
lot
upon
the
merger.
hilton
did
not
pay
in
its
stock
for
the
dissenting
shareholders'
stock.
there
was
a
change
of
status
for
the
dissenting
shareholders
from
that
of
stockholder
to
that
of
creditor.
the
only
evidence
pertinent
in
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
evidence
as
to
values
of
shares
of
the
shares
of
dissenting
shareholders.
there
was
no
evidence
introduced
or
which
could
be
introduced
as
to
the
value
of
the
hilton
shares
or
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
merger.
a
debtor-creditor
relationship
was
established
between
the
dissenters
and
waldorf
and
the
debt
of
waldorf
was
assumed
by
hilton
by
operation
of
law
on
the
merger.
the
relationship
of
debtor
and
creditor
is
established
amply
by
the
state
law
and
case
law
citations
in
our
brief.
after
the
demand
for
payment
in
the
objection
to
merger,
the
dissenters
have
none
of
the
attributes
of
stock
ownership.
under
state
law,
they
could
not
vote
on
any
matter
relating
to
waldorf
or
hilton.
they
could
receive
no
dividends
by
waldorf
or
hilton.
they
could
receive
no
liquidation
proceeds.
in
addition,
it
has
been
decided
that
by
the
federal
court
that
once
a
dissenter
elects
to
receive
payment
for
the
stock,
he
cannot
bring
a
derivative
suit
in
a
capacity
as
shareholder
even
while
the
appraisal
proceedings
is
in
progress.
in
addition,
the
dissenters
had
all
the
attributes
of
sellers
of
stock,
entitled
to
receive
payment
for
stock.
they
became
creditors
of
waldorf
and
then
hilton.
had
hilton
become
a
bankrupt,
they
would
have
been
entitled
to
receive
distributions
from
the
hilton
as
general
creditors
paired
to
pursue
with
other
general
creditors
prior
to
any
distribution
to
the
stockholders
of
hilton.
in
addition,
this
was
held
in
southern
production
company
versus
samoth
cited
in
our
brief.
in
addition,
the
dissenters
would
have
been
entitled
to
the
federal
protection
of
sec
rule
10(b)
relating
to
full
disclosure
with
respect
to
the
merger
because
they
would
have
been
considered
sellers
of
stock.
in
this
protection,
what
have
been
afforded
to
them
even
while
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
in
progress.
this
was
cited
--
this
was
decided
in
the
bouge
case
cited
in
our
brief.
as
prior
counsels
brought
out,
this
court
in
apsey
versus
kimball,
221
u.s.
would
have
decided
had
waldorf
been
a
banking
corporation
and
had
its
shareholders
been
subject
to
additional
liability,
this
court
decided
that
such
additional
liability
could
not
yet
been
imposed
upon
dissenters
who
had
elected
appraisal
rights.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
the
--
as
i
read
the
statute,
mr.
justice
white
the
stock
became
treasury
stock
and
waldorf
was
obligated
to
pay
for
it
at
its
fair
value.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
that
is
conceding
capital
expenditures.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
i
concede
that
your
honor
because
of
the
fact
that
it
was
unnecessary
for
hilton
to
exchange
the
one
in
a
quarter
shares
for
this
shares
that
has
ceased
to
become
outstanding
shares
of
waldorf.
it
was
the
purchase
price
--
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
my
point,
your
honor,
is
that
miscellaneous
expenses
are
not
connected
with
the
acquisition.
there
is
no
functional
relationship
between
the
acquisitions
and
these
expenditures.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
functional
relationship.
my
point
is
--
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
it
wasn't
that,
it
was
because
we
could
not
agree
on
price
that
we
incurred
these
expenditures.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
we
have
already
inquired
the
stock,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
we
could
not
back
out
if
nor
could
have
the
dissenting
shareholders.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
we
know
that
if
they
did
exercise
their
rights
we
would
have
had
to
buy
the
stock.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
absent
the
creation
of
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
waldorf
assumed
by
hilton
to
pay
for
the
stock,
the
appraisal
procedure
expenses
would
not
have
been
made.
the
dissenters,
when
they
dissented
and
demanded
payment,
elected
to
share
their
shares
under
terms
set
forth
by
the
state
of
new
york
in
its
statutes.
the
state
of
new
york
determined
who
the
parties
to
the
sale
were,
the
number
of
shares
to
be
sold
and
the
date
of
the
sale.
in
the
state
of
new
york
by
statute
also
determined
the
purchase
price
of
the
shares.
the
state
of
new
york
determined
that
the
purchase
price
of
the
shares
was
the
value
of
the
shares
on
the
day
before
the
meeting
of
waldorf
approving
the
merger.
neither
party,
neither
the
dissenters
nor
hilton
could
vary
the
price
to
be
paid
by
the
sharers,
for
the
sharers.
this
is
somewhat
similar
to
the
situation
keiselbach
versus
commission
317
u.s.
where
this
court
said
that
the
purchase
price
in
a
condemnation
proceeding
is
settled
as
of
the
date
the
property
was
taken.
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
not
part
of
an
acquisition
process
because
the
parties
were
not
negotiating
as
to
mutually
acceptable
terms
as
a
condition
to
sale.
this
is
not
analogous
to
try
to
finding
a
buyer
by
paying
broker
a
commission
nor
is
it
analogous
to
the
parties
bargaining
as
a
condition
to
sale
as
to
purchase
price.
without
an
agreement
as
to
purchase
price
there
would
have
been
no
sale
in
the
ordinary
circumstance.
in
this
circumstance
the
purchase
price
had
been
imposed
upon
by
the
state
and
the
sale
that
have
been
imposed
upon
the
party
by
the
state
once
the
election
was
made.
this
is
not
in
any
way
analogous
to
an
attorney
preparing
documents
to
consummate
a
sale,
without
the
signing
of
which
there
would
be
no
sale.
this
was
a
complete
sale
not
subject
to
renegotiation
by
either
party
to
the
sale.
the
dissenters
could
not
unilaterally
cancel
their
consent
and
resume
their
status
as
shareholders
of
hilton.
they
were
in
the
same
precision
as
a
private
seller
who
had
sold
his
stock
and
in
a
deferred
payment
and
the
payment
could
either
been
a
fixed
purchased
price
or
a
formula
purchase
price
or
a
price
to
be
determined
by
an
objective
standard
such
as
a
state
of
new
york
in
this
case
said
it
would
be
the
objective
standard
being
fair
value.
after
the
demand
for
payment,
the
shareholders,
the
dissenters
had
no
interest
in
waldorf
as
shareholders.
they
were
not
interested
in
whether
the
price
of
waldorf
stock
when
up
or
down
and
they
were
not
interested
whether
the
price
of
hilton
stock
went
up
or
down.
they
had
ceased
to
have
any
interest
as
equity
owner
and
merely
were
creditors.
this
reflects
--
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
i
will
think
your
honor
that
that
is
part
of
the
agreement
as
to
purchase
price
prior
to
the
consummation
of
the
sale.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
but
they
have
agreed
that
it
will
be
what
is
to
be
determined
by
the
third
party.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
i
think
the
answer
is
it
probably
would
be
a
capital
expense.
the
public
policy
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
this
appears
to
be
very
correct
because
if
the
waldorf
dissenters
could
resume
their
status
of
shareholders
and
hilton
stock
were
to
go
higher,
they
could
have
taken
advantage
of
the
increase
in
price
of
hilton
stock
while
in
any
event
having
a
downward
protection
because
of
hilton
stock
went
lower,
they
could
always
have
their
demand
for
the
fair
value
of
their
stock.
the
fact
of
the
--
dissenters
did
not
have
this
choice,
demonstrates
once
again
that
they
were
in
the
position
not
as
shareholders
when
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
commenced
but
as
creditors
and
the
purpose
of
the
appraisal
proceedings
was
to
determine
the
amount
owed
to
them
as
creditor.
in
summary,
on
this
point
the
dissenters
had
sold
their
stock
on
the
date
they
objected
to
the
merger
and
demanded
payment
for
their
stock.
they
have
no
claim
against
waldorf
or
hilton
as
share
holders
and
they
had
only
the
right
to
receive
payment
and
all
of
these
events
had
occurred
prior
to
the
appraisal
proceeding.
the
appraisal
proceeding
could
in
no
way
affect
the
acquisition.
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
not
an
equitable
proceeding
to
revise
or
modify
the
terms
of
a
sale
and
it
was
not
necessary
to
achieve
an
enforceable
bargain
because
an
enforceable
bargain
had
been
imposed
by
the
state
of
new
york.
it
was
also
not
necessary
to
achieve
the
essential
formalities
of
sale
because
those
formalities
were
taken
cared
of
by
law
and
it
was
not
necessary
to
establish
acceptable
terms
of
acquisition
because
the
terms
of
acquisition
had
been
imposed
by
law.
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
not
part
of
the
cost
of
acquisition
because
shares
were
acquired
prior
there
to
and
the
appraisal
proceeding
had
no
effect
on
the
acquisition.
title
involvement
has
always
been
a
necessary
element
to
determine
whether
an
item
is
to
be
capitalized
as
being
part
of
the
cost
of
acquisition,
perfection
or
defense
of
title
because
one
cannot
acquire
a
title
or
acquire
anything
without
title
being
involved.
title
involvement
its
necessary
touchstone
is
absent
from
the
appraisal
proceeding
because
title
to
shares
of
stock
of
the
dissenters
had
from
them
long
before
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
started.
most
of
the
government
cases
sighting
the
application
of
the
windmill
rationale
involved
title,
so
the
cases
cited
by
the
governments
are
clearly
not
applicable
and
if
the
cases
didn't
involve
title,
they
involved
the
recasting
of
sales
price
by
a
court
with
respect
to
a
sale
induced
by
fraud.
again,
a
bargaining
process
or
the
cases
involved
the
reaching
of
agreement
by
as
to
price
prior
to
title
being
passed
or
the
cases
involved
taking
the
necessary
steps
to
consummate
the
sale.
the
more
appropriate
cases
as
authority
for
this
case
is
a
case
of
petrick
decided
by
the
second
circuit
involving
a
confiscation
proceeding.
in
that
case,
the
taxpayers'
property
was
confiscated
by
a
foreign
government
and
the
proceeding
determining
the
award
was
based
upon
the
value
of
the
property
confiscated.
there
the
second
circuit
held
at
the
legal
cost
in
the
proceeding
were
deductible.
another
relevant
cases
the
naylor
case
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit.
in
that
case
an
option
was
exercised
to
purchase
stocks
and
the
parties
agreed
that
title
had
passed
but
the
option
price
was
set
at
the
book
value
of
the
shares
of
stock
at
a
certain
date
and
the
taxpayer
hired
an
attorney
because
a
dispute
arose
as
to
book
value.
the
attorney's
fees
were
held
to
be
deductible
because
title
had
passed
before
the
attorney
was
hired
and
he
was
hired
merely
to
collect
the
correct
amount
of
the
purchase
price
which
was
a
standard
set
by
agreement
among
the
parties'
book
value.
the
government's
reliance
upon
titled
cases
is
misplaced
and
rather
the
petrick
case
and
the
naylor
case
are
more
appropriate.
the
government
contends
that
the
origin
and
character
of
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
in
the
merger.
essentially,
the
argument
is
had
there
been
no
merger,
there
be
appraisal
proceeding.
but
the
cause
of
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
not
the
merger.
the
cause
of
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
in
the
objection
and
demand
for
payment
by
the
dissenters,
had
there
been
no
such
objection
or
demand
for
payment
there
would
be
no
appraisal
proceeding.
the
merger
had
been
completed
and
the
dissenters
could
not
affect
the
merger.
the
acquisition
of
the
dissenters'
stock
had
been
completed
and
the
dissenters
could
not
affect
such
acquisition.
it
was
not
from
the
merger
or
as
a
part
of
the
acquisition
that
the
appraisal
proceeding
arose
but
it
wasn't
a
debtor-creditor
relationship
established
between
the
dissenters
in
waldorf
and
the
fact
that
they
could
not
agree
on
the
fair
value
of
the
dissenters'
shares.
there
was
no
functional
relationship
between
the
appraisal
proceeding
and
the
merger
and
the
rules
with
respect
to
mergers
should
not
apply.
the
government
states
that
distinctions
in
state
law
should
not
govern
federal
tax
consequences
and
the
government
in
its
brief
cites
cases
where
there
was
no
substantive
difference
in
state
law
or
where
state
law
put
different
labels
on
the
same
property
rights
as
authority
for
the
statement.
however,
we
all
know
that
in
private
contracts
trying
to
accomplish
similar
ends,
different
tax
consequences
can
depend
upon
title.
there
is
one
case
in
the
lower
courts
other
than
woodward
in
which
the
appraisal
proceedings
were
held
and
to
be
deductible.
this
is
a
district
court
case
boulder
building
corporation
and
it
was
decided
under
the
appraisals
statute
at
18
oklahoma
statutes
annotated
1.161(a)
1953.
i
will
quote
this
statute
to
you.
“holders
of
dissenting
shares
of
a
domestic
corporation
shall
continue
to
have
all
the
rights
and
privileges
incident
to
their
shares
except
just
expressly
limited
by
this
section
until
such
time
is
a
fair
value
of
such
shares
be
agreed
upon
or
determined
by
judgment.”
there
were
no
appraisable
limitations
under
this
section.
i
submit
that
under
the

statutes,
the
dissenters
remain
shareholders
and
they
could
have
resumed
their
status
shareholders
which
is
entirely
different
in
the
state
law
in
new
york
when
they
had
forever
lost
their
status
as
shareholders.
the
government
says,
ignore
title
when
you
decide
this
case
but
one
must
always
be
concerned
with
title
if
one
is
going
to
impose
capitalization
because
the
title
acquisition
is
involved.
hilton
does
not
urge
the
use
of
the
primary
purpose
test
in
this
case
because
the
sole
purpose
of
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
to
determine
the
value
of
the
shares,
the
amount
of
the
debt
owed
by
hilton
and
there
was
no
element
of
title
involved
in
the
appraisal
proceeding.
mr.
milton
a.
levenfeld
your
honor,
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
between
setting
a
price
and
paying
a
price.
we
have
agreed,
hilton
had
agreed
to
pay
a
price.
it
was
a
price
that
was
imposed
upon
it
by
state
law
and
the
state
law
had
evolved
a
procedure
to
determine
the
price.
we
are
questioning
--
the
problem
we
have
is
to
categorize
the
expenses
in
determining
the
price.
there
is
no
question
that
the
price
itself
was
for
an
acquisition
yet
title
was
not
involved
in
the
price
determination
proceeding.
the
title
was
involved
in
the
acquisition
which
had
incurred
for
the
price
determining
proceeding.
in
summary,
the
expenses
of
hilton
in
the
appraisal
proceeding
should
not
be
capitalized
because
title
was
not
involved
in
the
appraisal
proceeding
and
hilton
acquired
nothing
as
a
result
of
the
appraisal
proceeding.
in
addition,
the
appraisal
proceeding
having
resulted
from
the
demand
for
payment
and
the
inability
for
the
debtor
and
creditor
to
agree
in
price
was
not
functionally
related
to
the
merger,
so
the
merger
rules
should
not
apply.
it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
those
expenses
in
the
appraisal
proceeding
are
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
deductible
under
section
162
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
thank
you.
