well,
the

the

before

what
happened
to

justice

how
does
the
purchase
price
of
the

and
i

the

is
that
concededly
a
capital
expenditure?
justice
byron

why
did
you
concede
that?
justice

white
why
wasn't
--
why
wasn't
the
expenditure
for
the

of
the

why
wasn't

no
what?

you

you
wouldn't
have
incurred
these

any

that
you
haven't
required
the

justice

white
right
but
you
still
want
to
divide
the
stocks?
justice
byron

white
i
suppose
you
could've
backed
out.
justice

but
you
knew
in

of

merger,
if
anybody
consented
you
would
have
to
buy
the
stock.

if
certainly
absent
some
dissent
and

of

you
wouldn't

what
if
the
buyer

seller
signed
a

for
the
purchase
of

and
they
signed
the
contract
both

they
set
the

item
except
one
piece
of
real

over
which
they
can't
agree

they
both
agree
that
the

the
appraiser
will
set
the
value
and
that's
the
price
that
will
be
paid
and
then
the
appraisers
sets
at
the

of
them
of
a
good
fee
and
they
split
it
what
about
the
buyer
there
on
that
appraisal
be,
doesn't
he
have
to
capitalize
that
expense?
justice

well,
he
doesn't
know
what
it
is
going

justice
byron

well,
your
answer
is
yes
it
would
be
a
capital
expenditure.
justice
byron

white
i
gather,
that
sounds
to
me
on
that
argument
that
you
could
if
you're
right
you
should
be
able
to
deduct
the
price
to
the
dissenter.
