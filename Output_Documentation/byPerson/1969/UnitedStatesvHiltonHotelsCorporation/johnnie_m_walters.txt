mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
relevant
facts
in
this
case
were
stipulated
and
may
be
summarized
in
pertinent
part.
in
august
1953,
hilton
hotels
corporation
owned
some
325,370
shares
of
the
366,040
shares
outstanding
of
the
hotel
waldorf-astoria
leaving
some
40,670
shares
of
waldorf
outstanding
in
the
hands
of
others.
contemplating
a
merger,
hilton
retained
consultants
to
do
a
study
to
determine
a
fair
basis
for
exchange
of
hilton
shares
for
waldorf
shares.
hilton
and
waldorf
agreed
upon
a
proposed
merger
with
hilton
to
be
the
surviving
corporation.
under
the
proposed
plan,
hilton
offered
to
exchange
1.25
shares
of
its
stock
for
each
share
of
the
waldorf
stock
it
did
not
already
owned.
prior
to
the
agreement
of
merger,
however,
shareholders
owning
some
20,000
shares
of
waldorf
filed
with
waldorf
an
objection
to
the
merger
and
demanded
payment
for
their
waldorf
stock.
thereafter,
on
december
28
and
29,
1953
more
than
2/3
of
the
stock
holders
of
each
of
the
two
corporations
voted
approval
of
the
merger
and
on
december
31,
1953,
the
merger
agreement
and
certificate
of
consolidation
were
filed
with
the
secretary
of
state
of
new
york.
the
applicable
new
york
law
provided
that
in
such
a
case
the
stockholder
demanding
payment
for
his
waldorf
shares
have
no
right
to
receive
dividends
payable
on
those
shares
after
the
close
of
business
on
the
day
preceding
to
the
date
that
the
waldorf
stockholders
voted
approval
of
the
merger
and
that
upon
that
vote
the
dissenting
stockholder
ceased
to
have
any
of
the
rights
of
a
stockholder
of
waldorf
except
the
right
to
receive
payment
of
the
value
of
the
stock.
under
the
new
york
law,
the
dissenting
stockholder
or
the
corporation
have
the
right
to
have
the
stock
appraised
in
a
court
proceeding.
complying
with
new
york
law
on
january
7,
1954,
hilton
offered
to
the
waldorf
stockholders
$24.54
for
each
share
of
waldorf
stock
it
did
not
already
own.
those
stockholders
who
had
dissented
from
the
merger
rejected
the
offer
and
began
court
proceedings
under
state
law
for
a
determination
of
the
buyer
of
their
shares.
hilton
again
retained
the
same
consulting
firm
to
determine
the
value
of
those
waldorf
shares
on
the
date
prior
to
the
vote
of
approval
of
the
merger.
in
addition
to
paying
those
consultants,
hilton
also
paid
almost
$40,000.00
to
lawyers
and
others
in
connection
with
the
court
proceedings
to
develop
that
value.
hilton
claimed
a
deduction
as
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense
under
section
162
of
the
code
for
all
of
the
fees
paid
to
the
consulting
firm,
attorneys
and
others
including
the
fees
that
have
been
paid
to
the
consultants
prior
to
the
vote
of
the
merger.
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
disallowed
the
deduction.
hilton
paid
the
asserted
deficiency
and
commenced
a
suit
for
refund.
the
district
court
held
that
the
appraisal
costs
were
deductible
but
that
the
consultant's
fees
that
were
incurred
prior
to
the
merger
were
nondeductible
capital
expenditures.
hilton
conceded
as
to
those
pre-merger
fees
and
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court
allowing
deduction
of
the
appraisal
fees.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
this
began
in
1953
sir.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
yes
sir.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
cannot
answer
that
it
seems
an
awful
long
time.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
yes
sir.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
no
doubt
that's
part
of
it
and
i
would
assume
that
in
a
situation
such
as
this
where
you
have
large
corporations
involved,
the
administration
on
audits
probably
did
not
come
until
late
in
the
statutory
period
and
then
all
of
the
proceedings
that
followed
that
each
eating
up
a
little
time.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
the
sole
issue
here
then
is
whether
the
fees
paid
to
the
consultants,
lawyers
and
others,
in
connections
with
the
appraisal
proceedings
that
followed
the
merger
are
deductible
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expenses
are
non-deductible
capital
expenditures.
what
we're
concerned
in
this
case
with
section
162
which
deals
with
business
expenses
and
also
with
section
263
again
as
in
the
last
case,
we
nevertheless
are
concerned
with
the
same
basic
principles
that
were
involved
in
the
woodward
case.
section
162
provides
a
deduction
for
the
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
paid
or
incurred
during
the
taxable
year
and
the
carrying
on
of
the
trade
of
business.
it
does
not
provide
a
deduction
for
a
capital
expenditure.
section
263
on
the
other
hand
prohibits
deductions
of
a
capital
expenditure.
the
origin
and
character
of
the
claim
with
respect
to
which
an
expenditure
is
incurred
determines
or
contributes
to
the
determination
of
whether
an
expenditure
is
or
is
not
deductible.
the
cost
of
acquiring
an
asset
and
capital
stock
are
not
deductible.
they
are
nondeductible
capital
expenditures.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
they
are
capital
items,
sir.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
no
sir.
all
of
the
expenses
--
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
that's
right
sir.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
yes
sir.
just
as
the
seventh
circuit
noted
below,
the
expenditures
incurred
in
connection
with
a
corporate
reorganization
such
as
the
ones
that
mr.
justice
white
just
asked
about
are
nondeductible
capital
expenditures.
in
considering
these
keys
along
side
the
woodward
case,
there
is
only
one
additional
item
that
we
think
we
should
mention.
in
woodward,
the
majority
shareholders
did
not
acquire
title
to
the
(inaudible)
stock
prior
to
the
appraisal
proceedings
whereas
in
this
case,
under
the
applicable
new
york
law,
the
merger
and
the
acquisition
were
both
accomplished
prior
to
the
appraisal
proceeding.
this
difference
in
timing
is
only
one
that
we
think
we
need
to
address
attention.
the
timing
--
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
i
don't
recall
mr.
justice,
which
came
first
calendar-wise.
no
sir,
it
did
not.
the
timing
of
the
appraisal
proceeding
with
respect
to
the
title
passage
is
immaterial.
the
appraisal
proceeding
in
this
case
too
was
directly
and
functionally
related
to
and
an
integral
part
of
the
overall
proceeding
which
was
a
corporate
reorganization.
this
was
not
a
causal
relationship.
it
was
part
and
partial
of
the
overall
transaction
the
corporate
reorganization
and
the
acquisition
of
the
waldorf
shares.
thus,
again,
we
note
that
the
tax
law
does
not
permit
fragmenting
of
transactions.
it
requires
events
that
are
functionally
related
to
be
looked
at
together
even
though
they
maybe
temporally
separated
time-wise.
we
submit
that
such
differences
as
exist
between
this
case
and
the
woodward
case
are
immaterial.
in
the
context
of
these
cases,
the
differences
in
timing
of
the
stock
appraisals
is
not
material
and
likewise
the
differences
between
the
new
york
and
iowa
statutes
are
not
material.
the
federal
tax
rules
in
the
two
cases
should
be
the
same.
in
neither
case
should
the
cost
of
these
appraisal
proceedings
be
deductible
and
woodward,
the
eighth
circuit
held
at
the
appraisal
cost
were
not
deductible
capital
expenditures
incurred
in
connection
with
the
acquisition
of
capital
stock.
in
this
case,
the
cost
of
the
appraisal
likewise
should
be
considered
a
part
of
the
cost
of
acquisition
of
the
waldorf
stock.
in
either
case,
the
appraisal
cost
were
capital
expenditures.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'll
just
mention
on
or
two
items
briefly.
again,
we
submit
these
two
cases
bring
to
this
court
two
instances
where
a
taxpayers
would
deduct
the
cost
of
determining
the
value
of
capital
stock
which
capital
stock
had
to
be
acquired
at
one
instance
by
individual
taxpayers
and
the
other
by
corporation
in
connection
with
corporate
action.
the
fact
that
the
timing
of
this
cost
came
either
before
or
after,
we
submit,
is
immaterial.
these
costs
were
incurred
as
a
part
and
parcel
of
the
overall
transaction
in
each
instance.
accordingly,
we
submit
that
the
court
should
decide
these
two
cases
alike
and
the
eighth
circuit
held
that
they
were
capital
expenditures
and
the
woodward
case
and
the
hilton
case
the
seventh
circuit
held
they
were
deductible.
we
think
that
they
eighth
circuit
is
right
and
that
the
seventh
circuit
is
wrong
but
we
submit
most
urgently
that
whatever
the
answer
is
we
need
one
rule.
these
are
not
isolated
instances.
there
are
many,
many
corporate
reorganizations,
mergers
and
other
items
actions
taking
place
today
where
this
is
going
to
be
a
recurring
event
so
we
need
a
rule
for
taxpayers
and
the
government
alike.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
mr.
justice,
there
are
several
decisions.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
yes
sir,
where
they've
gone
both
ways
really.
we
submit
that
the
better
view
is
that
applied
in
the
woodward
case
because
we
do
not
see
how
you
can
separate
out
this
appraisal
proceeding
which
is
required
to
determine
the
value
or
the
price
of
the
stock
from
the
overall
transactions.
now,
as
to
the
possible
distinctions
between
the
two
statutes
involved
in
this
case,
again,
we
say
they're
immaterial
because
if
you
cut
away
the
brush
and
look
at
the
main
transactions
that
we
have
here,
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
these
expenditures
were
incurred
in
the
purchase
of
capital
stock.
you
do
not
see
how
can
find
otherwise
when
you
look
at
the
whole
picture.
we
have
mentioned
very
briefly
the
point
mr.
justice
white
has
brought
out
in
questioning
if
hilton
felt
that
the
timing
was
as
important
as
it
is
then
we
submit
that
they
could
very
well
have
justified,
at
least
arguably
deducting
the
cost,
the
price
that
they
paid
for
the
stock
too
because
that
came
before
the
acquisition
also.
in
fact,
we
submit
that
the
concession
by
hilton
that
the
pre-merger
expenses
incurred,
expenditures
for
the
consultants,
constitute
nondeductible
capital
expenditures
indicates
that
they
too
feel
that
the
decision
in
the
woodward
case
is
correct.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
a
few
minutes
of
rebuttal.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
relevant
facts
in
this
case
were
stipulated
and
may
be
summarized
in
pertinent
part.
in
august
1953,
hilton
hotels
corporation
owned
some
325,370
shares
of
the
366,040
shares
outstanding
of
the
hotel
waldorf-astoria
leaving
some
40,670
shares
of
waldorf
outstanding
in
the
hands
of
others.
contemplating
a
merger,
hilton
retained
consultants
to
do
a
study
to
determine
a
fair
basis
for
exchange
of
hilton
shares
for
waldorf
shares.
hilton
and
waldorf
agreed
upon
a
proposed
merger
with
hilton
to
be
the
surviving
corporation.
under
the
proposed
plan,
hilton
offered
to
exchange
1.25
shares
of
its
stock
for
each
share
of
the
waldorf
stock
it
did
not
already
owned.
prior
to
the
agreement
of
merger,
however,
shareholders
owning
some
20,000
shares
of
waldorf
filed
with
waldorf
an
objection
to
the
merger
and
demanded
payment
for
their
waldorf
stock.
thereafter,
on
december
28
and
29,
1953
more
than
2/3
of
the
stock
holders
of
each
of
the
two
corporations
voted
approval
of
the
merger
and
on
december
31,
1953,
the
merger
agreement
and
certificate
of
consolidation
were
filed
with
the
secretary
of
state
of
new
york.
the
applicable
new
york
law
provided
that
in
such
a
case
the
stockholder
demanding
payment
for
his
waldorf
shares
have
no
right
to
receive
dividends
payable
on
those
shares
after
the
close
of
business
on
the
day
preceding
to
the
date
that
the
waldorf
stockholders
voted
approval
of
the
merger
and
that
upon
that
vote
the
dissenting
stockholder
ceased
to
have
any
of
the
rights
of
a
stockholder
of
waldorf
except
the
right
to
receive
payment
of
the
value
of
the
stock.
under
the
new
york
law,
the
dissenting
stockholder
or
the
corporation
have
the
right
to
have
the
stock
appraised
in
a
court
proceeding.
complying
with
new
york
law
on
january
7,
1954,
hilton
offered
to
the
waldorf
stockholders
$24.54
for
each
share
of
waldorf
stock
it
did
not
already
own.
those
stockholders
who
had
dissented
from
the
merger
rejected
the
offer
and
began
court
proceedings
under
state
law
for
a
determination
of
the
buyer
of
their
shares.
hilton
again
retained
the
same
consulting
firm
to
determine
the
value
of
those
waldorf
shares
on
the
date
prior
to
the
vote
of
approval
of
the
merger.
in
addition
to
paying
those
consultants,
hilton
also
paid
almost
$40,000.00
to
lawyers
and
others
in
connection
with
the
court
proceedings
to
develop
that
value.
hilton
claimed
a
deduction
as
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense
under
section
162
of
the
code
for
all
of
the
fees
paid
to
the
consulting
firm,
attorneys
and
others
including
the
fees
that
have
been
paid
to
the
consultants
prior
to
the
vote
of
the
merger.
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
disallowed
the
deduction.
hilton
paid
the
asserted
deficiency
and
commenced
a
suit
for
refund.
the
district
court
held
that
the
appraisal
costs
were
deductible
but
that
the
consultant's
fees
that
were
incurred
prior
to
the
merger
were
nondeductible
capital
expenditures.
hilton
conceded
as
to
those
pre-merger
fees
and
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court
allowing
deduction
of
the
appraisal
fees.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
this
began
in
1953
sir.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
yes
sir.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
cannot
answer
that
it

whether
the

in
connections
with
the
appraisal
proceedings
that
followed
the
merger
are

ordinary
and

what

with

not
provide
a

for
a
capital

section

on

prohibits

of

the
origin
and

of

with

to
which
an
expenditure
is

determines
or
contributes
to
the
determination
of
whether

is

the
cost
of
acquiring
an
asset
and

they
are
nondeductible
capital
expenditures.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
they
are
capital
items,
sir.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
no
sir.
all
of
the
expenses
--
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
that's
right
sir.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
yes
sir.
just
as
the
seventh
circuit
noted
below,
the
expenditures
incurred
in
connection
with
a
corporate
reorganization
such
as
the
ones
that
mr.
justice
white
just
asked
about
are
nondeductible
capital
expenditures.
in
considering
these
keys
along
side
the
woodward
case,
there
is
only
one
additional
item
that
we
think
we
should
mention.
in
woodward,
the
majority
shareholders
did
not
acquire
title
to
the
(inaudible)
stock
prior
to
the
appraisal
proceedings
whereas
in
this
case,
under
the
applicable
new
york
law,
the
merger
and
the
acquisition
were
both
accomplished
prior
to
the
appraisal
proceeding.
this
difference
in
timing
is
only
one
that
we
think
we
need
to
address
attention.
the
timing
--
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
i
don't
recall
mr.
justice,
which
came
first
calendar-wise.
no
sir,
it
did
not.
the
timing
of
the
appraisal
proceeding
with
respect
to
the
title
passage
is
immaterial.
the
appraisal
proceeding
in
this
case
too
was
directly
and
functionally
related
to
and
an
integral
part
of
the
overall
proceeding
which
was
a
corporate
reorganization.
this
was
not
a
causal
relationship.
it
was
part
and
partial
of
the
overall
transaction
the
corporate
reorganization
and
the
acquisition
of
the
waldorf
shares.
thus,
again,
we
note
that
the
tax
law
does
not
permit
fragmenting
of
transactions.
it
requires
events
that
are
functionally
related
to
be
looked
at
together
even
though
they
maybe
temporally
separated
time-wise.
we
submit
that
such
differences
as
exist
between
this
case
and
the
woodward
case
are
immaterial.
in
the
context
of
these
cases,
the
differences
in
timing
of
the
stock
appraisals
is
not
material
and
likewise
the
differences
between
the
new
york
and
iowa
statutes
are
not
material.
the
federal
tax
rules
in
the
two
cases
should
be
the
same.
in
neither
case
should
the
cost
of
these
appraisal
proceedings
be
deductible
and
woodward,
the
eighth
circuit
held
at
the
appraisal
cost
were
not
deductible
capital
expenditures
incurred
in
connection
with
the
acquisition
of
capital
stock.
in
this
case,
the
cost
of
the
appraisal
likewise
should
be
considered
a
part
of
the
cost
of
acquisition
of
the
waldorf
stock.
in
either
case,
the
appraisal
cost
were
capital
expenditures.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'll
just
mention
on
or
two
items
briefly.
again,
we
submit
these
two
cases
bring
to
this
court
two
instances
where
a
taxpayers
would
deduct
the
cost
of
determining
the
value
of
capital
stock
which
capital
stock
had
to
be
acquired
at
one
instance
by
individual
taxpayers
and
the
other
by
corporation
in
connection
with
corporate
action.
the
fact
that
the
timing
of
this
cost
came
either
before
or
after,
we
submit,
is
immaterial.
these
costs
were
incurred
as
a
part
and
parcel
of
the
overall
transaction
in
each
instance.
accordingly,
we
submit
that
the
court
should
decide
these
two
cases
alike
and
the
eighth
circuit
held
that
they
were
capital
expenditures
and
the
woodward
case
and
the
hilton
case
the
seventh
circuit
held
they
were
deductible.
we
think
that
they
eighth
circuit
is
right
and
that
the
seventh
circuit
is
wrong
but
we
submit
most
urgently
that
whatever
the
answer
is
we
need
one
rule.
these
are
not
isolated
instances.
there
are
many,
many
corporate
reorganizations,
mergers
and
other
items
actions
taking
place
today
where
this
is
going
to
be
a
recurring
event
so
we
need
a
rule
for
taxpayers
and
the
government
alike.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
mr.
justice,
there
are
several
decisions.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
yes
sir,
where
they've
gone
both
ways
really.
we
submit
that
the
better
view
is
that
applied
in
the
woodward
case
because
we
do
not
see
how
you
can
separate
out
this
appraisal
proceeding
which
is
required
to
determine
the
value
or
the
price
of
the
stock
from
the
overall
transactions.
now,
as
to
the
possible
distinctions
between
the
two
statutes
involved
in
this
case,
again,
we
say
they're
immaterial
because
if
you
cut
away
the
brush
and
look
at
the
main
transactions
that
we
have
here,
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
these
expenditures
were
incurred
in
the
purchase
of
capital
stock.
you
do
not
see
how
can
find
otherwise
when
you
look
at
the
whole
picture.
we
have
mentioned
very
briefly
the
point
mr.
justice
white
has
brought
out
in
questioning
if
hilton
felt
that
the
timing
was
as
important
as
it
is
then
we
submit
that
they
could
very
well
have
justified,
at
least
arguably
deducting
the
cost,
the
price
that
they
paid
for
the
stock
too
because
that
came
before
the
acquisition
also.
in
fact,
we
submit
that
the
concession
by
hilton
that
the
pre-merger
expenses
incurred,
expenditures
for
the
consultants,
constitute
nondeductible
capital
expenditures
indicates
that
they
too
feel
that
the
decision
in
the
woodward
case
is
correct.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
a
few
minutes
of
rebuttal.
