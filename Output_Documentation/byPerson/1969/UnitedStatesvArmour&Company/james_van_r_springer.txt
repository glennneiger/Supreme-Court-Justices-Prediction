mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
brings
to
this
court
for
the
fifth
time,
questions
under
the
great
meatpackers
antitrust
decree
of
1920.
that
decree
was
entered
on
consent
without
a
trial
on
the
basis
of
a
bill
in
equity
that
the
government
had
brought
against
the
nation’s
five
largest
meatpackers,
swift,
wilson,
cudahy,
armour
which
is
involved
in
this
case
and
morris
which
armour
subsequently
acquired.
the
complaint
in
general
charged
that
the
packers
had
violated
sections
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act
by
obtaining
control
of
a
very
great
proportion
of
the
food
supply
of
the
nation,
both
meat
and
other
foods,
and
by
abusing
that
control
so
as
to
restrict
competition
among
themselves
and
to
eliminate
their
other
competitors.
the
consent
decree
that
the
parties
agreed
upon
in
1920
and
that
the
court
adopted
imposed
sweeping
and
perpetual
restraints
both
upon
the
future
activities
of
the
packers
and
upon
the
business
relationships
that
the
packers
would
be
allowed
to
have
with
enterprises
engaged
in
the
production
and
sale
of
foods
other
than
meat.
and
despite
the
efforts
of
the
defendants
over
the
years
to
relax
these
restrictions,
they
remain
in
effect
and
this
court
most
recently
in
1961
rejected
an
attempt
by
the
packers
to
relax
the
restrictions
upon
them.
the
decree
is
complex
and
i
will
take
the
time
here
only
to
discuss
the
particular
paragraphs
that
are
in
issue
in
this
case,
that’s
principally
paragraph
fourth
of
the
decree
which
begins
on
page
30
of
the
appendix.
that
paragraph
provides
that
the
meatpacker
corporations,
including
of
course
armour,
are
perpetually
enjoined
and
restrained
from
either
directly
or
indirectly
by
themselves
or
through
their
officers,
directors,
agents,
or
servants
engaging
in
or
carrying
on
the
manufacturing,
jobbing,
selling,
transporting
except
this
common
carriers,
distributing
or
otherwise
dealing
in
some
114
listed
food
products,
including
bakery
products,
most
of
it
groceries,
vegetables
and
fruits.
paragraph
four
goes
on
to
provide
that
the
corporation
defendants
are
hereby
further
perpetually
enjoined
and
restrained
from
owning
either
directly
or
indirectly
severally
or
jointly
by
themselves
or
through
their
officers,
directors,
agents,
or
servants
from
owning
any
capital
stock
or
other
interest
whatsoever
in
any
corporation,
firm
or
association
except
common
carriers
which
is
in
the
same
business
as
what
i
mentioned,
of
manufacturing,
jobbing,
selling,
transporting,
distributing
or
otherwise
dealing
in
any
of
the
above
described
products
or
commodities.
paragraph
six
of
the
decree
further
perpetually
enjoins
the
defendants
from
operating
retail
meat
markets
and
paragraph
eight
enjoins
the
packers
from
dealing
directly
or
indirectly
in
fresh
milk
and
cream.
in
short,
the
meatpacker's
decree
perpetually
excludes
armour
from
having
any
direct
or
indirect
interest
whatsoever
in
any
firm
in
the
baking
or
general
grocery
business
and
it
prohibits
armour
from
otherwise
dealing
directly
or
indirectly
in
the
enumerated
products.
the
decree
as
what
is
commonly
referred
to
as
the
structural
decree
that
is
rather
than
simply
enjoining
the
defendants
from
particular
anti
competitive
acts.
it
establishes
a
prophylactic
separation
between
the
defendants'
business,
excluding
them
from
other
businesses
where
it's
felt
that
they're
involvement
and
might
create
a
danger
competition.
general
host,
which
is
the
appellee
in
this
case
is
the
company
that's
widely
involved
in
the
baking
business
and
the
general
grocery
and
restaurant
businesses.
it
was
known
until
a
couple
of
years
ago
as
general
baking
company
and
under
the
brand
name
bun
baking
company
and
others
that
manufactures
and
sells
throughout
the
country
a
complete
line
of
bread
and
other
bakery
products.
it
also
has
a
division
called
little
general
stores
which
has
some
380
convenience
retail
food
markets
in
various
parts
of
the
south
and
it
also
has
subsidiaries
that
operate
restaurants
and
other
tourist
facilities
throughout
the
country.
it's
plain
and
undisputed
in
this
case
that
general
host's
business
is
such
that
under
the
1920
decree
armour
could
not
have
acquired
any
direct
or
indirect
ownership
interest
whatsoever
in
general
host.
this
litigation
began
about
a
year
ago
when
general
host
decided
to
do
the
reverse
of
that.
it
would
take
over
armour
by
acquisition
techniques
that
have
become
familiar
in
recent
years.
over
the
opposition
of
armour's
management,
general
host
made
a
tender
offer
to
armour's
stockholders
in
which
had
sought
to
acquire
a
majority
of
armour
stock
in
return
for
package
of
the
debentures
and
the
stock
warrants
in
general
host.
the
tender
offer
was
expressly
conditioned
upon
the
tender
by
shareholders
of
enough
stock
to
give
general
host
an
absolute
majority
of
armour
stock
and
it
provided
that
it
will
called
off
if
that
amount
of
stock
were
not
tendered.
when
the
tender
offer
was
made,
the
government
immediately
sought
to
block
this
takeover
on
the
theory
that
a
corporate
alliance
between
armour's
meatpacking
business
and
general
host's
bakery
and
retail
grocery
businesses
would
be
just
as
inconsistent
with
the
meatpacker's
decree
if
initiated
by
general
host
as
it
would
have
been
if
initiated
by
armour.
it
was
plain
of
course
that
general
host's
acquisition
of
armour
would
not
be
directly
punishable
under
the
decree
since
the
active
party,
general
host,
was
not
a
party
to
that
decree.
accordingly,
the
government
went
to
the
district
court
in
chicago
which
has
had
continuing
jurisdiction
at
least
in
the
recent
years
over
the
meatpacker's
decree
and
there
the
government
requested
a
supplemental
order
to
prohibit
the
takeover
by
general
host.
it
did
this
consistent
with
paragraph
18
of
the
decree
which
like
most
decrees
expressly
retains
jurisdiction
for
the
purpose
of
taking
such
other
action
or
adding
to
the
foot
of
this
decree
such
other
relief
if
any
as
it
may
become
necessary
or
appropriate
for
the
carrying
out
in
enforcement
of
this
decree.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
not
in
terms
and
of
course
this
is
the
--
i
think
the
semantic
problem
that
is
at
the
heart
of
this
case.
of
course,
we'll
going
back
and
back
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
we
would
contend
that
there
would
not
be
any
requirement
for
different
kind
of
procedure
on
the
theory
that
i
of
course
will
elaborate
that
we
think
that
in
a
very
real
sense
the
four
corners
of
this
decree
do
provide
a
rather
clear
condemnation
of
this
kind
of
situation.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
other
words,
we're
not
--
the
government's
theory
of
the
case
to
approach
it
in
another
way
has
not
been
based
upon
any
sort
of
change
in
facts
other
than
of
course
the
undisputed
facts
it
takes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no
i
think
not,
and
of
course
i
could
make
further
observation
that
it
seems
a
little
strange
and
inconsistent
with
traditional
equitable
theories
for
a
decree
to
say
nobody
in
the
world
shall
takeover
this
company.
that's
an
unusual
form
and
that
the
least
for
decree
and
of
course
it
doesn't
have
any
operative
effect
in
the
normal
sense.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
but
what
we
say
--
i
was
just
addressing
myself
to
the
question
of
whether
the
presence
or
absence
of
such
language
in
a
decree
would
make
any
difference.
we
say
and
i
will
elaborate
that
substantively
this
decree
established
a
separation
between
these
two
businesses
and
the
establishment
of
that
separation
as
a
substantive
matter
is
frustrated
by
this
kind
of
takeover.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
it's
undisputed
that
the
opposite
is
the
situation.
it
was
opposed,
but
i
do
find
it
hard
to
see
why
under
the
theory
followed
below
and
the
theory
that
the
appellees
followed
why
that
should
make
any
difference.
whoever
does
it
or
whatever
the
motives
are,
whatever
the
intentions
are,
precisely
the
same
kind
of
situation
will
arise.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
of
course
the
section
5
of
the
sherman
act
specifically
does
provide
and
this
was
relied
upon
by
the
government
below
that
whenever
the
interests
of
justice
shall
so
require,
the
court
may
bring
in
additional
parties.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
oh!
the
amending
with
decree
well
i
think
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
general
host
and
of
course
section
5
permits
that
to
be
done
as
a
procedural
matter
and
establishes
the
court's
jurisdiction
over
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
believe
that
its
predecessor
general
baking
company
i
think
it
was
incorporated
in
1911.
of
course
it
had
no
connection
whatever
with
these
packers
and
there
was
no
reason
for
the
government
even
to
think
about
bringing
it
in
or
foreseeing
what
might
happen
in
a
very
different
kind
of
business
climate
some
50
years
later
on.
judge
hoffman
in
the
district
court
of
chicago
of
course
denied
the
government's
petition
to
add
general
host
as
a
party
and
to
add
an
order
to
the
decree
prohibiting
the
takeover.
he
relied
quite
simply
on
the
proposition
as
i
read
what
he
said
that
the
literal
terms
of
the
decree
do
not
prohibit
non-defendant
owners
of
stock
in
meat
packing
companies
from
engaging
in
businesses
prohibited
to
meatpackers
themselves
and
by
the
decree.
in
other
words,
as
he
explained
orally,
that
the
decisive
fact
in
the
case
was
that
armour
will
not
be
the
controlling
force
whether
the
instrumentality
of
general
host
is
ever
since
villain
of
the
peace
and
that's
the
term
he
used,
it
was
not
armour
but
general
host,
the
decree
was
powerless,
the
decree
could
not
be
used
to
prevent
the
takeover.
if
judge
hoffman's
rather
scanty
conclusions
of
law
rests
on
the
proposition
that
he
did
not
have
jurisdictional
power
to
supplement
the
decree
in
this
kind
of
way,
we
think
he
was
plainly
wrong,
for
the
reasons
that
we
set
out
in
our
brief
which
i
believe
are
not
basically
disputed
by
the
appellees.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it's
not
clear
that
it
did,
if
it
did
i
think
it
was
wrong.
i
think
power
is
not
really
an
issue
--
the
major
issue
that
is
here.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
believe
that
so,
yes.
there's
a
certain
amount
of
back
and
forth
i
think
within
general
host's
[voice
overlap]
briefs.
so,
i
will
direct
my
point
only
to
the
proposition
that
the
structural
prohibitions
of
this
decree
are
frustrated,
in
some
sense
violated
by
this
takeover.
and
i
think
general
host
does,
in
the
last
analysis,
agree
that
if
that's
the
case
then
the
court
could
and
indeed
should
have
granted
the
relief
requested.
i
think
this
perhaps
the
problem
as
i
suggested
in
this
case
is
a
semantic
one
basically.
the
basis
for
our
whole
case
is
the
proposition
that
the
decree
is
violated
or
frustrated
because
the
takeover
creates
the
situation
that
the
decree
was
designed
specifically
to
prevent.
general
host
and
the
court
below
as
i
understand
them
say
that
can't
be
so
because
nobody
has
disobeyed
the
command
that
the
decree
directed
to
them
because,
the
decree
does
not
in
terms
prescribed
armour's
acquisition
by
a
grocery
company.
we
think
that's
much
too
narrow
reading.
of
course
the
decree
is
not
--
a
civil
decree
is
not
punitive
document
and
it
obviously
does
affect
people
other
than
the
particular
individuals
who
happened
to
be
accused
of
wrong
doing
at
the
time
the
decree
was
entered.
so,
i
think
it's
not
shocking
or
unusual
the
decree
should
affect
parties
in
the
business
sense,
people
other
than
the
initial
parties
to
the
case.
we
think
in
fact
the
literal
language
of
the
decree
condemns
precisely
the
situation
that
has
been
created
by
the
takeover.
paragraph
four
not
only
prohibits
armour
from
indirectly
engaging
in
general
host's
business,
but
even
more
specifically,
it
prohibits
armour
from
having
directly
or
indirectly
any
capital
stock
or
other
interest
whatsoever
in
general
host
or
in
general
host
subsidiaries
that
are
engaged
in
the
businesses.
it
seems
to
me
extremely
literalistic
to
say
that
when
armour
is
the
subsidiary
of
general
host,
it
has
no
interest
whatsoever
either
in
general
host's
business
or
in
the
business
of
general
--
its
sister
subsidiaries
of
general
host.
certainly,
as
i
suggested,
this
conclusion
seems
not
difficult
to
reach
if
this
kind
of
situation
arose
by
actions
in
which
armour
or
its
management
joined
or
perhaps
even
instigated
and
equally
i
think
it
would
not
seem
troublesome
to
say
that
the
decree
which
prohibit
a
situation
where
armour
or
its
stockholders
or
management
or
dissident
stockholders
through
proxy
provider
or
something
like
that
created
a
holding
company
which
then
had
two
subsidiaries,
one
of
them
being
the
old
armour
and
the
other
being
general
host.
to
put
it
in
other
way,
the
situation
we
now
have
is
if
one
corporation
that
directly
or
indirectly
is
in
both
businesses,
the
meatpacking
business
and
the
grocery
business
and
that
corporation
is
general
host,
directly
in
the
grocery
business
and
it's
indirectly
in
the
meatpacking
business
through
its
controlled
subsidiary
armour.
and
we
think
that
that
is
just
precisely
what
the
structural
provisions
of
the
decree
prohibited
and
in
fact
the
only
reason
why
there
would
have
been
structural
provisions
in
the
decree
is
to
prevent
that
kind
of
situation
from
arising.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
five,
it
soon
became
four
through
the
merger
of
morris
into
armour.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
armour
is
number
two
i
believe.
swift
is
somewhat
larger.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
cudahy
is
quite
a
bit
smaller.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
that
might
have
been
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
no,
i
think
not
and
whether
we
could
have
a
theory
that
the
decree
ought
to
be
modified,
i
think
it
will
be
very
hard
for
them
to
hold,
but
of
course,
that's
the
situation
that
arises
in
the
case
of
any
decree.
it's
well
established
that
on
the
basis.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
[voice

historic
violation
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
certainly,
but
historic
violations
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
but
old
violations
do
give
raise
to
perpetual
decrees
and
of
course
there
is
a
ground
for
modification,
if
the
defendant
subject
to
the
initial
decree
can
prove
that
there
are
at
some
serious
competitive
disadvantages
because
of
drastic
changes
in
the
market.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
50
years,
mr.
justice
black.
it
has
been
twice,
well
three
times
there
are
some
current
efforts.
in
the
early
30s
meatpackers
tried
to
modify
it
to
relieve
them
of
just
these
restrictions
on
their
involvement
in
the
grocery
business
and
they
had
another
effort
beginning
in
the
late
50s
which
ended
in
1961
when
this
court
summarily
affirmed
the
district
court's
determination
that
the
packers
had
not
made
the
kind
of
showing
that
would
be
required
to
justify
a
modification
of
the
decree.
so,
the
decree,
though
it's
old,
has
been
in
the
sense
revivified
within
relatively
recent
years.
we
think
it's
highly
pertinent
to
the
problem
here
what
the
courts
said
in
considering
these
earlier
requests
for
modification
because
we
think
that
the
language
the
courts
used
and
analysis
this
court
and
the
district
court
followed
in
those
cases
gives
rather
explicit
content
to
the
substantive
prohibitions
and
shows
what
their
specific
purpose
was.
in
1932,
justice
cardozo
speaking
for
the
court
in
the
second
swift
case
in
this
court
rejected,
as
i
said,
contentions
that
the
market
had
changed
that
the
wrong
doers
were
not
in
the
picture
anymore
and
therefore
it
was
not
necessary
to
maintain
this
separation
between
the
grocery
business
and
the
meatpackers
business
and
the
court
used
the
following
language
which
i
think
is
revealing
here.
whether
the
defendants
would
resume
their
predatory
practices
if
they
were
to
deal
in
groceries
again,
we
do
not
know.
they
would
certainly
have
the
temptation
to
reason
with.
their
low
overhead
and
their
gigantic
size
even
when
they
are
viewed
as
separate
units
would
still
put
them
in
a
position
to
starve
out
weaker
rivals.
their
size
according
to
the
holding
in
this
court
is
not
an
offense
against
the
sherman
act
unless
maybe
to
the
point
at
which
it
amounts
to
monopoly,
but
size
carries
with
it
an
opportunity
for
abuse.
it
is
not
to
be
ignored
when
the
opportunity
is
proved
to
be
utilized
in
the
past.
the
original
decree
at
all
events
was
framed
upon
that
theory
and
justice
cardozo
went
on
to
say
that
if
the
grocery
business
is
added
to
the
meat
business,
there
may
be
many
instances
of
unfair
pressure
upon
retailers
and
others
with
the
design
of
forcing
them
to
buy
from
the
defendants
and
not
from
the
rival
groceries,
such
at
any
rate
was
the
rationale
of
the
decree
of
1920.
its
restraints
whether
just
or
excessive
were
born
of
that
fear.
the
difficulty
of
fretting
out
these
evils
and
repressing
them
when
discovered
supplies
an
additional
reason
why
the
structural
restriction
should
be
maintained.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
of
course
there
are
problems
and
i'm
told
enormous
problems
in
the
traditional
section
7
action
in
a
case
like
this.
the
point
i
was
driving
at
was
not
that
as
a
general
proposition
the
combination
of
a
large
packer
and
a
meat
company
is
a
bad
thing,
but
that
this
court
has
read
this
very
decree
which
has
a
party
to
it
armour
as
embodying
a
specific
purpose
to
prevent
that
kind
of
addition
of
the
grocery
business
to
armour's
meatpacking
business.
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
that
the
government
should
have
not
to
start
from
scratch
and
having
been
specifically
decreed
that
armour's
business
should
not
be
combined
with
the
grocery
business.
and
none
of
the
past
history,
language
the
court
have
used
is
there
any
suggestion
that
the
importance
of
this
separation
depends
upon
who
threatens
to
break
it
down.
the
reason
for
the
separation
is
plainly
the
danger
of
any
corporate
link
however
created
between
armour's
large
size
and
power
which
of
course
when
general
host
owns
and
controls
armour
in
a
very
real
sense
becomes
the
power
that
general
host
has.
certainly,
there
are
separate
corporate
entities,
but
i
find
it
very
hard
in
my
mind
to
say
that
when
general
host
wholly
or
in
the
sense
of
absolute
control
owns
armour
that
general
host
is
not
armour
in
some
very
meaningful
sense.
the
ultimate
owners
are
the
same.
armour's
destiny
is
controlled
by
general
host.
so,
i
think
that
apart
from
the
conceptual
fact
that
there
are
separate
corporate
shells,
if
you
will,
armour
is
in
a
very
real
sense
or
has
become
general
host.
general
host
is
--
armour
has
the
power
that
the
decree
was
specifically
designed
to
keep
armour
from
using
in
a
business
which
is
general
host's
business.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
greyhound
is
in
the
picture,
yes.
there
has
been
a
contract
signed
as
i
understand
it,
but
mr.
bergson
will
have
the
up-to-date
information
i
think
better
than
i
do.
a
contract
was
signed
last
fall
whereby
general
host
would
sell
its
interests
to
greyhound,
that
contract
has
not
been
consummated.
it's
subject
to
several
contingencies,
one
of
which
we
don't
know
what
the
meaning
of
the
parties
attached
to
this
is
the
absence
of
any
government
action
against
the
consummation
of
the
contract.
the
government
has
notified
greyhound
that
we
feel
that
greyhound's
ownership
of
armour's
stock
would
present
substantially
the
same
problem
as
general
host
because
greyhound
owns
a
great
many
restaurants
and
also
has
a
food
distributing
business.
now,
whether
that
fact
is
enough
to
wash
out
this
contract
to
something
that
i
don't
know
that
perhaps
general
host
comes
[voice
overlap]
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
if
i
have
said
would
this
the
same
amount,
with
that
same
kind
of
proceeding
trial
have
been
held?
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
we
say
that
under
these
circumstances
there
are
no
undisputed
facts
that
are
pertinent
to
the
proposition
that
the
government
is
seeking
to
establish
that
the
four
corners
of
the
decree
prohibit
this
situation.
of
course,
in
various
situations
there
might
well
be
pertinent
facts
that
would
have
to
be
explored
at
an
evidentiary
hearing,
but
we
say,
that's
not
the
case
here.
i'd
like
if
i
can
to
reserve
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
perhaps
i
should
correct
something.
i
may
have
slightly
misstated
in
answer
to
a
question.
of
course,
we
think
what
we're
asking
for
here
is
very
different
from
any
hypothetical
general
amendment
of
this
decree
to
try
to
make
it
run
against
the
world.
we
of
course
agree
that
the
decree
can't
run
against
the
world
and
that
is
precisely
why
we
haven't
contended
and
wouldn't
contend
that
general
host
has
done
anything
that
would
subject
it
to
punishment
for
contempt
of
this
decree.
the
government
filed
a
petition,
gave
general
host
the
opportunity
to
have
a
hearing
and
to
bring
in
anything
they
wanted
to
bring
in
on
the
issue
whether
or
not
it's
proper
that
this
decree
should
give
rise
to
a
new
order
directed
directly
to
general
host
which
then
of
course
would
subject
it
to
contempt
punishment.
so,
we
don't
see
that
there's
any
issue
of
due
process
in
this
case
at
all.
general
host
has
had
a
hearing
and
the
only
issue
was
what
ought
to
be
said
at
that
hearing.
if
mr.
bergson
is
asserting
the
proposition
that
it
is
only
parties
who
are
in
direct
active
concert
with
the
parties
to
a
decree
who
in
any
way
can
be
effected
by
the
decree,
i
think
for
one
thing
he
is
suggesting
a
doctrine
which
is
inconsistent
with
what
appears
to
be
accepted
doctrine
and
specifically
in
the
civil
rights
area
where
this
has
come
up.
the
simple
fact
that
a
man
who
comes
in
and
tries
to
frustrate
the
performance
of
a
school
desegregation
decree
is
not
working
together
with
the
school
board
against
whom
that
decree
in
terms
was
directed
has
never
been
a
barrier
for
a
supplemental
order
very
much
like
kind
of
supplemental
order
we're
asking
for
here
against
a
particular
individual.
although
mr.
bergson
acknowledges
that
decree,
and
we
don't
disagree
with
him,
contains
both
behavioral
provisions
and
structural
restrictions.
he
then
turns
around
as
i
understand
his
argument
and
treats
the
decree
as
if
it
contained
nothing
but
behavioral
prohibitions.
for
that
reason
we
think
it's
--
we
think
that's
wrong
and
we
think
that
that's
really
beside
the
point
to
argue
again
and
again
that
this
decree
could
not
possibly
affect
general
host
because
no
court
has
ever
determined
that
general
host
had
done
anything
bad.
i
think
that
argument
in
substance
was
rejected
in
the
earlier
modification
proceedings
in
this
case
where
a
similar
argument
was
made
that
that
the
bad
people
who
made
armour
do
bad
things
in
the
past
and
made
the
other
packers
do
bad
things
aren't
here
anymore.
now,
we
just
have
a
new
set
of
stockholders
and
the
management
who
are
totally
innocent
and
of
course
they
shouldn't
be
bound
by
past
wrong
doings
of
other
people.
i
think
that's
really
beside
of
the
point.
one
other
matter,
i
think,
any
suggestion
that
the
fact
that
this
decree
contains
a
paragraph
which
relates
to
what
might
be
done
by
particular
individuals
none
of
whom
by
himself
was
a
controlling
stockholder,
at
least
in
the
case
of
armour
i
believe,
to
say
that
that
is
the
means
that
--
nor
the
part
of
the
decree
has
any
bearing
on
interlocking
corporate
interest,
i
think
simply
doesn't
follow.
i
think
the
problem
of
the
individual
defendants
in
1920
was
a
relatively
small,
separate
problem
and
that
to
say
that
that
precludes
the
government
to
take
any
action
against
what
might
be
a
100%
owned,
100%
owning
corporate
stockholder,
i
think
doesn't
follow.
again,
for
that
same
reason,
we
think
that
any
attempt
to
say
that
the
government
is
bound
because
it
did
not
take
any
action
against
the
prince
family
problem
is
erroneous
for
a
number
of
reasons.
that
was
in
the
matter
of
an
individual
stock
ownership
at
the
most
i
believe
by
an
amalgamation
of
people
who
are
various
members
of
the
prince
family,
various
people
who
are
said
perhaps
to
have
some
kind
of
relationship
with
them.
general
host
has
managed
to
reach
a
total
of
perhaps
13%
from
stock
ownership
in
armour.
here
where
the
dealing
with
absolute
corporate
control
by
another
corporation
and
of
course,
also
this
is
not
a
matter
of
past
course
of
action
between
these
two
parties
about
this
subject
matter,
but
the
collateral
matter
in
those
returns.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
brings
to
this
court
for
the
fifth
time,
questions
under
the
great
meatpackers
antitrust
decree
of
1920.
that
decree
was
entered
on
consent
without
a
trial
on
the
basis
of
a
bill
in
equity
that
the
government
had
brought
against
the
nation’s
five
largest
meatpackers,
swift,
wilson,
cudahy,
armour
which
is
involved
in
this
case
and
morris
which
armour
subsequently
acquired.
the
complaint
in
general
charged
that
the
packers
had
violated
sections
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act
by
obtaining
control
of
a
very
great
proportion
of
the
food
supply
of
the
nation,
both
meat
and
other
foods,
and
by
abusing
that
control
so
as
to
restrict
competition
among
themselves
and
to
eliminate
their
other
competitors.
the
consent
decree
that
the
parties
agreed
upon
in
1920
and
that
the
court
adopted
imposed
sweeping
and
perpetual
restraints
both
upon
the
future
activities
of
the
packers
and
upon
the
business
relationships
that
the
packers
would
be
allowed
to
have
with
enterprises
engaged
in
the
production
and
sale
of
foods
other
than
meat.
and
despite
the
efforts
of
the
defendants
over
the
years
to
relax
these
restrictions,
they
remain
in
effect
and
this
court
most
recently
in
1961
rejected
an
attempt
by
the
packers
to
relax
the
restrictions
upon
them.
the
decree
is
complex
and
i
will
take
the
time
here
only
to
discuss
the
particular
paragraphs
that
are
in
issue
in
this
case,
that’s
principally
paragraph
fourth
of
the
decree
which
begins
on
page
30
of
the
appendix.
that
paragraph
provides
that
the
meatpacker
corporations,
including
of
course
armour,
are
perpetually
enjoined
and
restrained
from
either
directly
or
indirectly
by
themselves
or
through
their
officers,
directors,
agents,
or
servants
engaging
in
or
carrying
on
the
manufacturing,
jobbing,
selling,
transporting
except
this
common
carriers,
distributing
or
otherwise
dealing
in
some
114
listed
food
products,
including
bakery
products,
most
of
it
groceries,
vegetables
and
fruits.
paragraph
four
goes
on
to
provide
that
the
corporation
defendants
are
hereby
further
perpetually
enjoined
and
restrained
from
owning
either
directly
or
indirectly
severally
or
jointly
by
themselves
or
through
their
officers,
directors,
agents,
or
servants
from
owning
any
capital
stock
or
other
interest
whatsoever
in
any
corporation,
firm
or
association
except
common
carriers
which
is
in
the
same
business
as
what
i
mentioned,
of
manufacturing,
jobbing,
selling,
transporting,
distributing
or
otherwise
dealing
in
any
of
the
above
described
products
or
commodities.
paragraph
six
of
the
decree
further
perpetually
enjoins
the
defendants
from
operating
retail
meat
markets
and
paragraph
eight
enjoins
the
packers
from
dealing
directly
or
indirectly
in
fresh
milk
and
cream.
in
short,
the
meatpacker's
decree
perpetually
excludes
armour
from
having
any
direct
or
indirect
interest
whatsoever
in
any
firm
in
the
baking
or
general
grocery
business
and
it
prohibits
armour
from
otherwise
dealing
directly
or
indirectly
in
the
enumerated
products.
the
decree
as
what
is
commonly
referred
to
as
the
structural
decree
that
is
rather
than
simply
enjoining
the
defendants
from
particular
anti
competitive
acts.
it
establishes
a
prophylactic
separation
between
the
defendants'
business,
excluding
them
from
other
businesses
where
it's
felt
that
they're
involvement
and
might
create
a
danger
competition.
general
host,
which
is
the
appellee
in
this
case
is
the
company
that's
widely
involved
in
the
baking
business
and
the
general
grocery
and
restaurant
businesses.
it
was
known
until
a
couple
of
years
ago
as
general
baking
company
and
under
the
brand
name
bun
baking
company
and
others
that
manufactures
and
sells
throughout
the
country
a
complete
line
of
bread
and
other
bakery
products.
it
also
has
a
division
called
little
general
stores
which
has
some
380
convenience
retail
food
markets
in
various
parts
of
the
south
and
it
also
has
subsidiaries
that
operate
restaurants
and
other
tourist
facilities
throughout
the
country.
it's
plain
and
undisputed
in
this
case
that
general
host's
business
is
such
that
under
the
1920
decree
armour
could
not
have
acquired
any
direct
or
indirect
ownership
interest
whatsoever
in
general
host.
this
litigation
began
about
a
year
ago
when
general
host
decided
to
do
the
reverse
of
that.
it
would
take
over
armour
by
acquisition
techniques
that
have
become
familiar
in
recent
years.
over
the
opposition
of
armour's
management,
general
host
made
a
tender
offer
to
armour's
stockholders
in
which
had
sought
to
acquire
a
majority
of
armour
stock
in
return
for
package
of
the
debentures
and
the
stock
warrants
in
general
host.
the
tender
offer
was
expressly
conditioned
upon
the
tender
by
shareholders
of
enough
stock
to
give
general
host
an
absolute
majority
of
armour
stock
and
it
provided
that
it
will
called
off
if
that
amount
of
stock
were
not
tendered.
when
the
tender
offer
was
made,
the
government
immediately
sought
to
block
this
takeover
on
the
theory
that
a
corporate
alliance
between
armour's
meatpacking
business
and
general
host's
bakery
and
retail
grocery
businesses
would
be
just
as
inconsistent
with
the
meatpacker's
decree
if
initiated
by
general
host
as
it
would
have
been
if
initiated
by
armour.
it
was
plain
of
course
that
general
host's
acquisition
of
armour
would
not
be
directly
punishable
under
the
decree
since
the
active
party,
general
host,
was
not
a
party
to
that
decree.
accordingly,
the
government
went
to
the
district
court
in
chicago
which
has
had
continuing
jurisdiction
at
least
in
the
recent
years
over
the
meatpacker's
decree
and
there
the
government
requested
a
supplemental
order
to
prohibit
the
takeover
by
general
host.
it
did
this
consistent
with
paragraph
18
of
the
decree
which
like
most
decrees
expressly
retains
jurisdiction
for
the
purpose
of
taking
such
other
action
or
adding
to
the
foot
of
this
decree
such
other
relief
if
any
as
it
may
become
necessary
or
appropriate
for
the
carrying
out
in
enforcement
of
this
decree.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
not
in
terms
and
of
course
this
is
the
--
i
think
the
semantic
problem
that
is
at
the
heart
of
this
case.
of
course,
we'll
going
back
and
back
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
we
would
contend
that
there
would
not
be
any
requirement
for
different
kind
of
procedure
on
the
theory
that
i
of
course
will
elaborate
that
we
think
that
in
a
very
real
sense
the
four
corners
of
this
decree
do
provide
a
rather
clear
condemnation
of
this
kind
of
situation.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
other
words,
we're
not
--
the
government's
theory
of
the
case
to
approach
it
in
another
way
has
not
been
based
upon
any
sort
of
change
in
facts
other
than
of
course
the
undisputed
facts
it
takes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no
i
think
not,
and
of
course
i
could
make
further
observation
that
it
seems
a
little
strange
and
inconsistent
with
traditional
equitable
theories
for
a
decree
to
say
nobody
in
the
world
shall
takeover
this
company.
that's
an
unusual
form
and
that
the
least
for
decree
and
of
course
it
doesn't
have
any
operative
effect
in
the
normal
sense.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
but
what
we
say
--
i
was
just
addressing
myself
to
the
question
of
whether
the
presence
or
absence
of
such
language
in
a
decree
would
make
any
difference.
we
say
and
i
will
elaborate
that
substantively
this
decree
established
a
separation
between
these
two
businesses
and
the
establishment
of
that
separation
as
a
substantive
matter
is
frustrated
by
this
kind
of
takeover.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
it's
undisputed
that
the
opposite
is
the
situation.
it
was
opposed,
but
i
do
find
it
hard
to
see
why
under
the
theory
followed
below
and
the
theory
that
the
appellees
followed
why
that
should
make
any
difference.
whoever
does
it
or
whatever
the
motives
are,
whatever
the
intentions
are,
precisely
the
same
kind
of
situation
will
arise.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
of
course
the
section
5
of
the
sherman
act
specifically
does
provide
and
this
was
relied
upon
by
the
government
below
that
whenever
the
interests
of
justice
shall
so
require,
the
court
may
bring
in
additional
parties.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
oh!
the
amending
with
decree
well
i
think
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
general
host
and
of
course
section
5
permits
that
to
be
done
as
a
procedural
matter
and
establishes
the
court's
jurisdiction
over
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
believe
that
its
predecessor
general
baking
company
i
think
it
was
incorporated
in
1911.
of
course
it
had
no
connection
whatever
with
these
packers
and
there
was
no
reason
for
the
government
even
to
think
about
bringing
it
in
or
foreseeing
what
might
happen
in
a
very
different
kind
of
business
climate
some
50
years
later
on.
judge
hoffman
in
the
district
court
of
chicago
of
course
denied
the
government's
petition
to
add
general
host
as
a
party
and
to
add
an
order
to
the
decree
prohibiting
the
takeover.
he
relied
quite
simply
on
the
proposition
as
i
read
what
he
said
that
the
literal
terms
of
the
decree
do
not
prohibit
non-defendant
owners
of
stock
in
meat
packing
companies
from
engaging
in
businesses
prohibited
to
meatpackers
themselves
and
by
the
decree.
in
other
words,
as
he
explained
orally,
that
the
decisive
fact
in
the
case
was
that
armour
will
not
be
the
controlling
force
whether
the
instrumentality
of
general
host
is
ever
since
villain
of
the
peace
and
that's
the
term
he
used,
it
was
not
armour
but
general
host,
the
decree
was
powerless,
the
decree
could
not
be
used
to
prevent
the
takeover.
if
judge
hoffman's
rather
scanty
conclusions
of
law
rests
on
the
proposition
that
he
did
not
have
jurisdictional
power
to
supplement
the
decree
in
this
kind
of
way,
we
think
he
was
plainly
wrong,
for
the
reasons
that
we
set
out
in
our
brief
which
i
believe
are
not
basically
disputed
by
the
appellees.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it's
not
clear
that
it
did,
if
it
did
i
think
it
was
wrong.
i
think
power
is
not
really
an
issue
--
the
major
issue
that
is
here.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
believe
that
so,
yes.
there's
a
certain
amount
of
back
and
forth
i
think
within
general
host's
[voice
overlap]
briefs.
so,
i
will
direct
my
point
only
to
the
proposition
that
the
structural
prohibitions
of
this
decree
are
frustrated,
in
some
sense
violated
by
this
takeover.
and
i
think
general
host
does,
in
the
last
analysis,
agree
that
if
that's
the
case
then
the
court
could
and
indeed
should
have
granted
the
relief
requested.
i
think
this
perhaps
the
problem
as
i
suggested
in
this
case
is
a
semantic
one
basically.
the
basis
for
our
whole
case
is
the
proposition
that
the
decree
is
violated
or
frustrated
because
the
takeover
creates
the
situation
that
the
decree
was
designed
specifically
to
prevent.
general
host
and
the
court
below
as
i
understand
them
say
that
can't
be
so
because
nobody
has
disobeyed
the
command
that
the
decree
directed
to
them
because,
the
decree
does
not
in
terms
prescribed
armour's
acquisition
by
a
grocery
company.
we
think
that's
much
too
narrow
reading.
of
course
the
decree
is
not
--
a
civil
decree
is
not
punitive
document
and
it
obviously
does
affect
people
other
than
the
particular
individuals
who
happened
to
be
accused
of
wrong
doing
at
the
time
the
decree
was
entered.
so,
i
think
it's
not
shocking
or
unusual
the
decree
should
affect
parties
in
the
business
sense,
people
other
than
the
initial
parties
to
the
case.
we
think
in
fact
the
literal
language
of
the
decree
condemns
precisely
the
situation
that
has
been
created
by
the
takeover.
paragraph
four
not
only
prohibits
armour
from
indirectly
engaging
in
general
host's
business,
but
even
more
specifically,
it
prohibits
armour
from
having
directly
or
indirectly
any
capital
stock
or
other
interest
whatsoever
in
general
host
or
in
general
host
subsidiaries
that
are
engaged
in
the
businesses.
it
seems
to
me
extremely
literalistic
to
say
that
when
armour
is
the
subsidiary
of
general
host,
it
has
no
interest
whatsoever
either
in
general
host's
business
or
in
the
business
of
general
--
its
sister
subsidiaries
of
general
host.
certainly,
as
i
suggested,
this
conclusion
seems
not
difficult
to
reach
if
this
kind
of
situation
arose
by
actions
in
which
armour
or
its
management
joined
or
perhaps
even
instigated
and
equally
i
think
it
would
not
seem
troublesome
to
say
that
the
decree
which
prohibit
a
situation
where
armour
or
its
stockholders
or
management
or
dissident
stockholders
through
proxy
provider
or
something
like
that
created
a
holding
company
which
then
had
two
subsidiaries,
one
of
them
being
the
old
armour
and
the
other
being
general
host.
to
put
it
in
other
way,
the
situation
we
now
have
is
if
one
corporation
that
directly
or
indirectly
is
in
both
businesses,
the
meatpacking
business
and
the
grocery
business
and
that
corporation
is
general
host,
directly
in
the
grocery
business
and
it's
indirectly
in
the
meatpacking
business
through
its
controlled
subsidiary
armour.
and
we
think
that
that
is
just
precisely
what
the
structural
provisions
of
the
decree
prohibited
and
in
fact
the
only
reason
why
there
would
have
been
structural
provisions
in
the
decree
is
to
prevent
that
kind
of
situation
from
arising.
mr.
james
van

it
soon

the
merger
of

into

mr.
james

i
believe.

is
somewhat
larger.
mr.
james
van

is
quite
a
bit
smaller.
mr.
james
van

springer
i
think
that
might
have
been
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
no,
i
think
not
and
whether
we
could
have
a
theory
that
the
decree
ought
to
be
modified,
i
think
it
will
be
very
hard
for
them
to
hold,
but
of
course,
that's
the
situation
that
arises
in
the
case
of
any
decree.
it's
well
established
that
on
the
basis.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
[voice

historic
violation
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
certainly,
but
historic
violations
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
but
old
violations
do
give
raise
to
perpetual
decrees
and
of
course
there
is
a
ground
for
modification,
if
the
defendant
subject
to
the
initial
decree
can
prove
that
there
are
at
some
serious
competitive
disadvantages
because
of
drastic
changes
in
the
market.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
50
years,
mr.
justice
black.
it
has
been
twice,
well
three
times
there
are
some
current
efforts.
in
the
early
30s
meatpackers
tried
to
modify
it
to
relieve
them
of
just
these
restrictions
on
their
involvement
in
the
grocery
business
and
they
had
another
effort
beginning
in
the
late
50s
which
ended
in
1961
when
this
court
summarily
affirmed
the
district
court's
determination
that
the
packers
had
not
made
the
kind
of
showing
that
would
be
required
to
justify
a
modification
of
the
decree.
so,
the
decree,
though
it's
old,
has
been
in
the
sense
revivified
within
relatively
recent
years.
we
think
it's
highly
pertinent
to
the
problem
here
what
the
courts
said
in
considering
these
earlier
requests
for
modification
because
we
think
that
the
language
the
courts
used
and
analysis
this
court
and
the
district
court
followed
in
those
cases
gives
rather
explicit
content
to
the
substantive
prohibitions
and
shows
what
their
specific
purpose
was.
in
1932,
justice
cardozo
speaking
for
the
court
in
the
second
swift
case
in
this
court
rejected,
as
i
said,
contentions
that
the
market
had
changed
that
the
wrong
doers
were
not
in
the
picture
anymore
and
therefore
it
was
not
necessary
to
maintain
this
separation
between
the
grocery
business
and
the
meatpackers
business
and
the
court
used
the
following
language
which
i
think
is
revealing
here.
whether
the
defendants
would
resume
their
predatory
practices
if
they
were
to
deal
in
groceries
again,
we
do
not
know.
they
would
certainly
have
the
temptation
to
reason
with.
their
low
overhead
and
their
gigantic
size
even
when
they
are
viewed
as
separate
units
would
still
put
them
in
a
position
to
starve
out
weaker
rivals.
their
size
according
to
the
holding
in
this
court
is
not
an
offense
against
the
sherman
act
unless
maybe
to
the
point
at
which
it
amounts
to
monopoly,
but
size
carries
with
it
an
opportunity
for
abuse.
it
is
not
to
be
ignored
when
the
opportunity
is
proved
to
be
utilized
in
the
past.
the
original
decree
at
all
events
was
framed
upon
that
theory
and
justice
cardozo
went
on
to
say
that
if
the
grocery
business
is
added
to
the
meat
business,
there
may
be
many
instances
of
unfair
pressure
upon
retailers
and
others
with
the
design
of
forcing
them
to
buy
from
the
defendants
and
not
from
the
rival
groceries,
such
at
any
rate
was
the
rationale
of
the
decree
of
1920.
its
restraints
whether
just
or
excessive
were
born
of
that
fear.
the
difficulty
of
fretting
out
these
evils
and
repressing
them
when
discovered
supplies
an
additional
reason
why
the
structural
restriction
should
be
maintained.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
of
course
there
are
problems
and
i'm
told
enormous
problems
in
the
traditional
section
7
action
in
a
case
like
this.
the
point
i
was
driving
at
was
not
that
as
a
general
proposition
the
combination
of
a
large
packer
and
a
meat
company
is
a
bad
thing,
but
that
this
court
has
read
this
very
decree
which
has
a
party
to
it
armour
as
embodying
a
specific
purpose
to
prevent
that
kind
of
addition
of
the
grocery
business
to
armour's
meatpacking
business.
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
that
the
government
should
have
not
to
start
from
scratch
and
having
been
specifically
decreed
that
armour's
business
should
not
be
combined
with
the
grocery
business.
and
none
of
the
past
history,
language
the
court
have
used
is
there
any
suggestion
that
the
importance
of
this
separation
depends
upon
who
threatens
to
break
it
down.
the
reason
for
the
separation
is
plainly
the
danger
of
any
corporate
link
however
created
between
armour's
large
size
and
power
which
of
course
when
general
host
owns
and
controls
armour
in
a
very
real
sense
becomes
the
power
that
general
host
has.
certainly,
there
are
separate
corporate
entities,
but
i
find
it
very
hard
in
my
mind
to
say
that
when
general
host
wholly
or
in
the
sense
of
absolute
control
owns
armour
that
general
host
is
not
armour
in
some
very
meaningful
sense.
the
ultimate
owners
are
the
same.
armour's
destiny
is
controlled
by
general
host.
so,
i
think
that
apart
from
the
conceptual
fact
that
there
are
separate
corporate
shells,
if
you
will,
armour
is
in
a
very
real
sense
or
has
become
general
host.
general
host
is
--
armour
has
the
power
that
the
decree
was
specifically
designed
to
keep
armour
from
using
in
a
business
which
is
general
host's
business.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
greyhound
is
in
the
picture,
yes.
there
has
been
a
contract
signed
as
i
understand
it,
but
mr.
bergson
will
have
the
up-to-date
information
i
think
better
than
i
do.
a
contract
was
signed
last
fall
whereby
general
host
would
sell
its
interests
to
greyhound,
that
contract
has
not
been
consummated.
it's
subject
to
several
contingencies,
one
of
which
we
don't
know
what
the
meaning
of
the
parties
attached
to
this
is
the
absence
of
any
government
action
against
the
consummation
of
the
contract.
the
government
has
notified
greyhound
that
we
feel
that
greyhound's
ownership
of
armour's
stock
would
present
substantially
the
same
problem
as
general
host
because
greyhound
owns
a
great
many
restaurants
and
also
has
a
food
distributing
business.
now,
whether
that
fact
is
enough
to
wash
out
this
contract
to
something
that
i
don't
know
that
perhaps
general
host
comes
[voice
overlap]
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
if
i
have
said
would
this
the
same
amount,
with
that
same
kind
of
proceeding
trial
have
been
held?
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
we
say
that
under
these
circumstances
there
are
no
undisputed
facts
that
are
pertinent
to
the
proposition
that
the
government
is
seeking
to
establish
that
the
four
corners
of
the
decree
prohibit
this
situation.
of
course,
in
various
situations
there
might
well
be
pertinent
facts
that
would
have
to
be
explored
at
an
evidentiary
hearing,
but
we
say,
that's
not
the
case
here.
i'd
like
if
i
can
to
reserve
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
perhaps
i
should
correct
something.
i
may
have
slightly
misstated
in
answer
to
a
question.
of
course,
we
think
what
we're
asking
for
here
is
very
different
from
any
hypothetical
general
amendment
of
this
decree
to
try
to
make
it
run
against
the
world.
we
of
course
agree
that
the
decree
can't
run
against
the
world
and
that
is
precisely
why
we
haven't
contended
and
wouldn't
contend
that
general
host
has
done
anything
that
would
subject
it
to
punishment
for
contempt
of
this
decree.
the
government
filed
a
petition,
gave
general
host
the
opportunity
to
have
a
hearing
and
to
bring
in
anything
they
wanted
to
bring
in
on
the
issue
whether
or
not
it's
proper
that
this
decree
should
give
rise
to
a
new
order
directed
directly
to
general
host
which
then
of
course
would
subject
it
to
contempt
punishment.
so,
we
don't
see
that
there's
any
issue
of
due
process
in
this
case
at
all.
general
host
has
had
a
hearing
and
the
only
issue
was
what
ought
to
be
said
at
that
hearing.
if
mr.
bergson
is
asserting
the
proposition
that
it
is
only
parties
who
are
in
direct
active
concert
with
the
parties
to
a
decree
who
in
any
way
can
be
effected
by
the
decree,
i
think
for
one
thing
he
is
suggesting
a
doctrine
which
is
inconsistent
with
what
appears
to
be
accepted
doctrine
and
specifically
in
the
civil
rights
area
where
this
has
come
up.
the
simple
fact
that
a
man
who
comes
in
and
tries
to
frustrate
the
performance
of
a
school
desegregation
decree
is
not
working
together
with
the
school
board
against
whom
that
decree
in
terms
was
directed
has
never
been
a
barrier
for
a
supplemental
order
very
much
like
kind
of
supplemental
order
we're
asking
for
here
against
a
particular
individual.
although
mr.
bergson
acknowledges
that
decree,
and
we
don't
disagree
with
him,
contains
both
behavioral
provisions
and
structural
restrictions.
he
then
turns
around
as
i
understand
his
argument
and
treats
the
decree
as
if
it
contained
nothing
but
behavioral
prohibitions.
for
that
reason
we
think
it's
--
we
think
that's
wrong
and
we
think
that
that's
really
beside
the
point
to
argue
again
and
again
that
this
decree
could
not
possibly
affect
general
host
because
no
court
has
ever
determined
that
general
host
had
done
anything
bad.
i
think
that
argument
in
substance
was
rejected
in
the
earlier
modification
proceedings
in
this
case
where
a
similar
argument
was
made
that
that
the
bad
people
who
made
armour
do
bad
things
in
the
past
and
made
the
other
packers
do
bad
things
aren't
here
anymore.
now,
we
just
have
a
new
set
of
stockholders
and
the
management
who
are
totally
innocent
and
of
course
they
shouldn't
be
bound
by
past
wrong
doings
of
other
people.
i
think
that's
really
beside
of
the
point.
one
other
matter,
i
think,
any
suggestion
that
the
fact
that
this
decree
contains
a
paragraph
which
relates
to
what
might
be
done
by
particular
individuals
none
of
whom
by
himself
was
a
controlling
stockholder,
at
least
in
the
case
of
armour
i
believe,
to
say
that
that
is
the
means
that
--
nor
the
part
of
the
decree
has
any
bearing
on
interlocking
corporate
interest,
i
think
simply
doesn't
follow.
i
think
the
problem
of
the
individual
defendants
in
1920
was
a
relatively
small,
separate
problem
and
that
to
say
that
that
precludes
the
government
to
take
any
action
against
what
might
be
a
100%
owned,
100%
owning
corporate
stockholder,
i
think
doesn't
follow.
again,
for
that
same
reason,
we
think
that
any
attempt
to
say
that
the
government
is
bound
because
it
did
not
take
any
action
against
the
prince
family
problem
is
erroneous
for
a
number
of
reasons.
that
was
in
the
matter
of
an
individual
stock
ownership
at
the
most
i
believe
by
an
amalgamation
of
people
who
are
various
members
of
the
prince
family,
various
people
who
are
said
perhaps
to
have
some
kind
of
relationship
with
them.
general
host
has
managed
to
reach
a
total
of
perhaps
13%
from
stock
ownership
in
armour.
here
where
the
dealing
with
absolute
corporate
control
by
another
corporation
and
of
course,
also
this
is
not
a
matter
of
past
course
of
action
between
these
two
parties
about
this
subject
matter,
but
the
collateral
matter
in
those
returns.
