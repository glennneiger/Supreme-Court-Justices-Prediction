justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
government's
request
to
the
district
court
subsume
a
request
to
amend
the
decree?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
the
government
had
taken
the
approach
that
we
think
the
decree
should
be
amended
expressly
to
prohibit
matters
like
these,
would
any
different
kind
of
a
hearing
or
any
different
kind
of
procedure
then
required?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,let's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
--
if
you
accepted
the
fact
that
the
purpose
of
the
decree
was
to
prohibit
an
alliance
of
any
kind
between
the
armour
entity
and
any
of
the
other
described
entities
then
it
wouldn't
make
much
difference
whether
you
amended
it
or
just
interpreted
it,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
some
suggestions
i
saw
i
guess
in
the
brief
or
that
this
is
a
transitory
or
impermanent
situation,
that
greyhound
is
in
the
picture
somewhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
bergson
what
would
the
--
what
would
you
say
if
the
original
decree
had
said
that
armour
can
acquire
any
stock
in
a
baking
company
and
no
baking
company
can
acquire
any
stock
in
armour
and
then
this
transaction
took
place
and
the
united
states
applied
to
the
court
for
an
order
preventing
general
host
from
--
which
had
never
been
a
party
to
the
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
prevent
general
host
from
acquiring
stock
in
armour?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
no
parties
do
--
no
parties
to
injunction
suits
can
be
held
in
contempt
or
even
have
the
order
amended
to
apply
to
them
without
re-litigating
the
basic
factors
of
the
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree,
i
know,
that's
what
i
say.
your
assertion
is
that
unless
you're
a
party
to
an
injunction
suit,
you
can
never
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
nobody
has
attempted
to
hold
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
nobody
has
attempted
to
hold
general
host
in
contempt.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
without
having
a
hearing
as
to
whether
or
not
on
the
whole
basic
substance
of
the
injunction
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
suppose
that
general
host
and
armour
made
a
contract
to
sell
a
large
amount
of
treasury
stock
of
general
host
to
armour
and
the
government
applied
for
an
order
against
both
armour
and
general
host.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
wouldn't
you,
because
the
the
order
against
general
host?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there's
a
non-party
being
subjective
to
the
injunction
without
being
able
to
re-litigate
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
that's
the
way
you
characterize
it
but
nevertheless
that's
a
non-party
being
subjected
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
prince
family?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
it
would
make
any
difference
if
general
host
acquires
100%
of
the
stock?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
district
judge
thought
that
would
have
made
a
difference?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
seem
to
emphasize
the
lack
of
the
possibility
immediately
of
general
host
getting
control
of
the
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
what
kind
of
a
hearing
would
you
say
that
you
required
for
the
government
to
[inaudible]
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
effectuate
what
mr.
bergson?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
think
the
purpose
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
apparently
deny
that
one
of
the
purposes
that
you
effect
to
separate
the
meatpackers
and
other
food
processors?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the

request

the
