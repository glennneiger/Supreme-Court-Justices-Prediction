mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
i
should
answer
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
first
by
describing
the
present
status
of
the
negotiations
between
general
host
and
greyhound.
the
agreement
was
signed
some
time
ago,
subject
to
three
things,
approval
of
general
host
stockholders,
approval
of
armour's
stock
--
no,
greyhound
stockholders,
and
approval
of
the
icc
because
greyhound
is
a
motor
carrier
and
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
any
acquisition
of
this
type
must
be
approved
by
the
icc.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
that's
correct.
and
the
greyhound
stockholders
have
approved
the
agreement.
the
general
host
stockholders
have
approved
the
agreement,
the
icc
has
not
yet
acted
on
the
application.
and
i
am
not
prepared
to
prognosticate
this
too
when
the
icc
might
act
on
that
application.
now,
as
mr.
springer
indicated,
there
is
also
a
problem
as
to
what
the
department
might
do
in
attacking
the
general
host's
--
the
greyhound
acquisition
in
the
same
manner
that
it
has
attacked
general
host
acquisition
but
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
a
condition
to
the
consummation
of
the
transaction.
there
is
a
provision
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
i
suspect
that
the
department
of
justice
can
intervene
or
move
to
be
heard
as
amicus
or
make
their
presence
felt
at
the
icc
in
a
way
that
their
views
would
made
known
at
the
icc.
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
whether
the
department
could
intervene,
i
believe
it
could.
they
intervened
in
railroad
mergers
and
i
don't
know
why
they
couldn't
intervene
in
the
case,
in
a
situation
like
this,
but
even
if
they
couldn't
intervene,
they
certainly
could
make
their
view
known
as
amicus.
now,
i
was
delighted
to
hear
mr.
springer
say
that
there's
no
issue
as
to
the
power
of
the
court
here
to
whether
the
court
has
the
power
to
protect
its
decrees
from
interference
or
obstruction.
as
i
read
the
government's
brief
in
this
case,
i
thought
that
this
was
their
major
point.
and
that
the
case
has
now
become
what
i
think
it
was
all
along,
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
decree
as
it
now
stands
can
be
interpreted
to
prevent
this
transaction
and
if
it
can
be
so
interpreted
what
type
of
hearing
is
general
host
entitled
to
before
that
interpretation
is
imposed
on
general
host.
what
the
department
did
in
this
case
was
merely
to
go
to
the
district
court,
file
an
affidavit
and
say
general
host
is
in
the
baking
business.
the
baking
business
is
proscribed
to
armour,
therefore,
you
must
proscribe
this
transaction
and
we
don't
think
the
only
hearing
that
they
thought
was
necessary
was
to
show
that
general
host
was
in
the
baking
business.
now,
i
think
it's
somewhat
shocking
for
the
department
of
justice
to
take
the
position
that
a
person
who
is
not
a
party
to
an
equity
decree
was
never
been
heard
on
that
decree,
who
was
not
joined
at
the
time
of
the
decree
although
it
was
in
existence
at
the
time
the
action
was
maintained.
it's
bound
by
the
decree
without
proof
of
anything
else.
it
seems
to
me
that
under
any
circumstances
even
assuming
that
the
department's
interpretation
of
the
decree
is
right,
the
general
host
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
whether
or
not
it
should
be
bound
by
the
decree
because
i
don't
believe
that
two
parties
to
a
lawsuit
with
the
imprimatur
of
the
court
can
deprive
anybody
obvious
legal
rights
and
one
of
the
basic
legal
rights
that
a
person
seems
to
have
is
the
right
to
due
process,
the
right
to
be
heard.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
i
think
that
under
those
circumstances
general
host
would
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
as
to
whether
or
not
that
type
of
order
should
have
been
entered
in
the
first
place.
let
me
give
you
an
illustration
your
honor
and
i
think
it's
terribly
important
especially
in
these
days.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
oh!
no,
general
host
was
not
a
party
to
the
injunction
suit.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
you
can't
be
held
in
contempt
to
that
injunction.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
and
the
department
concedes
that.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
but,
i
don't
think
that
they
can
be
made
subject
to
the
injunctive
provisions
without
having
a
hearing
as
to
whether
or
not
they
should
have
been
made.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
well,
whether
or
not
this
case
was
based
primarily
on
a
proclivity
by
these
meatpackers
to
violate
the
antitrust
laws,
that
they
had
a
long
standing
conspiracy
that
and
it
encompassed
not
only
horizontal
agreements
among
them,
but
vertical
agreements.
they
own
food
businesses,
they
own
stockyards
they
own
warehouses,
they
own
transportation
facilities
and
as
a
result
of
all,
these
tremendous
mess
they
were
able
to
affect
the
commerce
in
the
substitute
food
business.
now,
i
think
that
they
consented
to
this
decree.
but
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
it's
a
consent
decree
or
a
litigated
decree,
but
nevertheless,
would
seem
--
it
seems
to
me
and
it
is
my
position
that
under
the
circumstances
that
you
postulate,
they
would
have
to
be
shown
that
this
decree
should
be
imposed
on
general
host
and
not
merely
because
it
was
into
baking
business.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
i
don't
have
any
problem
with
that
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
because
they
--
i
think
an
injunction
is
applicable
to
not
only
to
the
parties,
but
anybody
in
proclivity
or
acting
in
consent
with
the
parties
and
under
the
circumstances
that
you
postulated
they
would
be
acting
in
consent.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
but
he
is
doing
in
privity
with
the
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
i
think
i
can
state
my
position
this
way.
that
to
the
extent
that
any
non-party
is
found
to
have
been
acting
in
concert
of
privity
with
a
party
whether
it
says
so
in
the
decree
or
it
doesn't
say
so
in
the
decree,
the
rules
make
such
a
privy
subject
to
the
injunction.
but
the
government
concedes
here
that
there
was
no
such
concert
and
that
there
was
no
such
privity
and
you're
talking,
they're
trying
to
make
the
decree
applicable
to
a
company
that
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
and
no
friendly
relations
with
any
defendant
and
i
think
that
this
is
carrying
an
equity
decree
far
beyond
this
scope
that
it
has
ever
been
carried
by
this
court
and
probably
ever
would
be
carried
by
this
court.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
i
don't
believe
that's
the
--
i
don't
believe
you
correctly
characterized
my
suggestion.
you're
talking
about
something
that
i
said
or
something
in
our
brief?
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
no.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
well,
that's
right.
it
may
not
be
realistic,
but
i
think
that's
the
only
thing
that
they
could
do
what
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
that's
right.
but
our
position
here
your
honor
is
this.
number
one,
that
the
decree
can't
be
interpreted
the
way
the
government
seeks
to
interpret
it
and
you
just
can't
turn
words
upside
down.
if
you
look
at
the
decree
as
in
this
writ,
the
decree
was
very,
very
carefully
framed.
and
it
is
not
a
structural
decree
per
se
as
mr.
springer
would
have
you
believe.
there
are
many
behavioral,
behavioral
provisions
in
the
decree.
there
were
three
types
of
defendants
in
this
case.
there
were
the
meatpacker
defendants,
there
were
individual
defendants
who
are
the
major
stockholders
in
the
meat
companies
and
there
were
some
50
subsidiaries
of
the
meat
companies
who
were
defendants.
this
was
a
--
there
were
quite
a
few
defendants
in
this
case.
now,
when
the
consent
decree
was
negotiated,
these
various
defendants
were
given
different
types
of
treatment,
the
provision
that
mr.
springer
referred
to,
two
of
them,
four
and
eight
specifically
referred
to
corporate
defendants.
paragraph
six
which
is
another
one
that
he
referred
to
applies
to
all
defendants
and
paragraph
five
of
the
decree
applies
to
individual
defendants.
now,
in
paragraph
five
of
the
decree,
the
individual
defendants,
the
people
who
were
then
in
control
of
the
meatpackers
were
permitted
to
own
stock
in
the
forbidden
businesses,
the
businesses
forbidden
to
the
meatpackers
and
they
were
permitted
to
own
up
to
50%
of
the
stock,
no
question
to
control
this
as
this
court
well
knows
that
you
can
control
a
company
with
much
less
than
50%
of
the
stock.
these
companies
were
permitted
to
engage
in
these
forbidden
businesses
and
there
was
an
injunctive
provision
which
says,
but
you
can't
use
them
in
a
way
that
would
help
either
armour
in
its
business
or
yourself
or
use
armour
in
a
way
to
help
you
in
your
business.
so,
that
this
decree
did
not
declare
a
complete
separation
as
the
government
says
of
the
business
of
meatpacking
from
substitute
foods.
it
said
only
this,
that
the
defendant
meatpackers,
the
defendant
meatpackers
and
that
is
the
way
that
the
language
of
the
decree
is,
the
packer
defendants,
corporate
defendants,
are
enjoined
from
doing
this.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can't
characterize
this
decree
as
a
prophylactic
structural
decree,
but
this
is
a
decree
that
was
arrived
at
by
negotiation
and
it
was
some
structure
and
some
behavioral
and
the
parties
knew
exactly
what
they
were
doing
and
they
did
not
intend
to
reach
the
situation.
maybe
they
weren't
aware
of
it,
maybe
it
didn't
occur
to
them,
but
obviously
they
didn't
intend
either
sub
silentio
or
actually
to
reach
the
situation
that
is
covered
here.
so
that,
in
effect
what
the
department
is
seeking
here
is
a
modification
of
the
decree
as
mr.
justice
white
indicated
and
i
might
add
here
that
the
department
has
construed
this
decree
in
the
past
the
same
way
that
we're
construing
it
now
because
they
have
--
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
decree
prohibits
the
packers
from
engaging
in
the
stockyard
business,
but
the
people
who
controlled
armour
before
general
host
acquired
the
control
of
armour
also
controlled
the
chicago
stockyards,
this
is
all
set
out
in
our
briefs.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
that's
the
prince
family,
yes
your
honor
and
our
brief
points
out
what
the
stock
holdings
were.
they
had
10%
to
15%
of
the
stock
and
there
was
a
cross
privilization
of
management
and
there
was
no
--
and
the
government
hasn't
contested
this.
and
the
government
has
said
in
connection
with
that
argument,
well
maybe
we
construed
the
decree
erroneously
before,
but
we're
doing
it
right
now.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
oh
no.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
he
thought
that
that
would
make
a
difference.
i
think
that
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
no,
but
i
think
what
he
went
on
to
say
however
that
he
did
not
find
that
control
itself
would
be
bad
and
that
if
general
host
abused
its
control
and
caused
armour
to
violate
the
decree
come
on
back,
and
i'll
enjoin
it
quick
as
a
flash,
but
mere
ownership
doesn't
cause
armour
to
violate
the
decree.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
well,
what
happened
--
there
are
a
couple
of
precedents
in
this
area.
one
is
this
court's
decision
in
the
hughes
case
where
the
government
sought
a
construction
of
the
decree
and
the
court
sent
it
back
and
said
that
this
was
an
attempt
to
modify
the
decree
and
that
an
appropriate
hearing
should
be
had
to
determine
whether
this
type
of
relief
is
necessary.
now,
i
think
we're
entitled
to
a
hearing
as
to
whether,
at
least
a
hearing,
as
to
whether
or
not
this
type
of
relief
is
necessary
to
effectuate
--
let
us
go
this
far,
i'm
just
conceding
this
for
argue
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
to
effectuate
what
the
government
claims
with
the
purposes
of
this
decree.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
the
purpose
of
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
no,
i
say
that
it
was
--
it
was
--
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
prevent
proven
or
admitted
violators
who
had
used
their
power
in
the
past
from
using
it
in
the
future
which
is
done
in
many,
many
antitrust
cases,
but
we
are
non-proven
violator
and
we
are
a
non-proven
violator
or
non-admitted
violator.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
oh
no,
i
don't
think
anything
in
this
decree,
anything
in
this
decree
prohibits
the
largest
beef
packer
in
the
country
today,
this
isn't
in
the
record
but
i
hope
you'll
pardon,
but
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
asked
this
question.
the
largest
beef
packer
in
the
united
states
today,
which
the
iowa
beef
company
is
not
subject
to
this
decree
and
it
can
go
out
and
acquire
general
host
any
day
it
wants.
now,
all
the
government
can
do
about
that
is
bring
a
section
7
case
and
i
think
that's
what
the
government
should
do
here.
if
they
think,
if
they
think
that
general
host
control
of
armour
constitutes
a
reasonable
probability
of
a
substantial
lessening
of
competition
in
any
line
of
commerce,
they
have
a
section
7
case.
they're
not
without
remedy
here,
even
apart
from
the
decree.
but
what
the
government
is
trying
to
do
here,
we
submit
your
honor
is
that
just
short
circuit
this
whole
business
probably
out
of
fear
that
they
can't
successfully
maintain
a
section
7
case
or
couldn't
successfully
maintain
the
burden
of
modifying
the
decree
which
is
a
heavy
burden
and
the
rule
of
which
had
been
laid
it
down
in
one
of
the
prior
decisions
in
this
case
and
to
avoid
that
burden
both
for
modification
and
for
proving
a
section
7
violation
they
have
adopted
this
arbitrary,
summary
procedure
or
seek
to
have
you
sanction
this
arbitrary
summary
procedure
which
deprives
general
host
of
its
day
in
court
and
we
submit
your
honor
that
this
is
not
an
appropriate
form
of
action
in
this
area,
thank
you.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
i
should
answer
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
first
by
describing
the
present
status
of
the
negotiations
between
general
host
and
greyhound.
the
agreement
was
signed
some
time
ago,
subject
to
three
things,
approval
of
general
host
stockholders,
approval
of
armour's
stock
--
no,
greyhound
stockholders,
and
approval
of
the
icc
because
greyhound
is
a
motor
carrier
and
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
any
acquisition
of
this
type
must
be
approved
by
the
icc.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
that's
correct.
and
the
greyhound
stockholders
have
approved
the
agreement.
the
general
host
stockholders
have
approved
the
agreement,
the
icc
has
not
yet
acted
on
the
application.
and
i
am
not
prepared
to
prognosticate
this
too
when
the
icc
might
act
on
that
application.
now,
as
mr.
springer
indicated,
there
is
also
a
problem
as
to
what
the
department
might
do
in
attacking
the
general
host's
--
the
greyhound
acquisition
in
the
same
manner
that
it
has
attacked
general
host
acquisition
but
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
a
condition
to
the
consummation
of
the
transaction.
there
is
a
provision
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
i
suspect
that
the
department
of
justice
can
intervene
or
move
to
be
heard
as
amicus
or
make
their
presence
felt
at
the
icc
in
a
way
that
their
views
would
made
known
at
the
icc.
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
whether
the
department
could
intervene,
i
believe
it
could.
they
intervened
in
railroad
mergers
and
i
don't
know
why
they
couldn't
intervene
in
the
case,
in
a
situation
like
this,
but
even
if
they
couldn't
intervene,
they
certainly
could
make
their
view
known
as
amicus.
now,
i
was
delighted
to
hear
mr.
springer
say
that
there's
no
issue
as
to
the
power
of
the
court
here
to
whether
the
court
has
the
power
to
protect
its
decrees
from
interference
or
obstruction.
as
i
read
the
government's
brief
in
this
case,
i
thought
that
this
was
their
major
point.
and
that
the
case
has
now
become
what
i
think
it
was
all
along,
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
decree
as
it
now
stands
can
be
interpreted
to
prevent
this
transaction
and
if
it
can
be
so
interpreted
what
type
of
hearing
is
general
host
entitled
to
before
that
interpretation
is
imposed
on
general
host.
what
the
department
did
in
this
case
was
merely
to
go
to
the
district
court,
file
an
affidavit
and
say
general
host
is
in
the
baking
business.
the
baking
business
is
proscribed
to
armour,
therefore,
you
must
proscribe
this
transaction
and
we
don't
think
the
only
hearing
that
they
thought
was
necessary
was
to
show
that
general
host
was
in
the
baking
business.
now,
i
think
it's
somewhat
shocking
for
the
department
of
justice
to
take
the
position
that
a
person
who
is
not
a
party
to
an
equity
decree
was
never
been
heard
on
that
decree,
who
was
not
joined
at
the
time
of
the
decree
although
it
was
in
existence
at
the
time
the
action
was
maintained.
it's
bound
by
the
decree
without
proof
of
anything
else.
it
seems
to
me
that
under
any
circumstances
even
assuming
that
the
department's
interpretation
of
the
decree
is
right,
the
general
host
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
whether
or
not
it
should
be
bound
by
the
decree
because
i
don't
believe
that
two
parties
to
a
lawsuit
with
the
imprimatur
of
the
court
can
deprive
anybody
obvious
legal
rights
and
one
of
the
basic
legal
rights
that
a
person
seems
to
have
is
the
right
to
due
process,
the
right
to
be
heard.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
i
think
that
under
those
circumstances
general
host
would
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
as
to
whether
or
not
that
type
of
order
should
have
been
entered
in
the
first
place.
let
me
give
you
an
illustration
your
honor
and
i
think
it's
terribly
important
especially
in
these
days.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
oh!
no,
general
host
was
not
a
party
to
the
injunction
suit.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
you
can't
be
held
in
contempt
to
that
injunction.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
and
the
department
concedes
that.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
but,
i
don't
think
that
they
can
be
made
subject
to
the
injunctive
provisions
without
having
a
hearing
as
to
whether
or
not
they
should
have
been
made.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
well,
whether
or
not
this
case
was
based
primarily
on
a
proclivity
by
these
meatpackers
to
violate
the
antitrust
laws,
that
they
had
a
long
standing
conspiracy
that
and
it
encompassed
not
only
horizontal
agreements
among
them,
but
vertical
agreements.
they
own
food
businesses,
they
own
stockyards
they
own
warehouses,
they
own
transportation
facilities
and
as
a
result
of
all,
these
tremendous
mess
they
were
able
to
affect
the
commerce
in
the
substitute
food
business.
now,
i
think
that
they
consented
to
this
decree.
but
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
it's
a
consent
decree
or
a
litigated
decree,
but
nevertheless,
would
seem
--
it
seems
to
me
and
it
is
my
position
that
under
the
circumstances
that
you
postulate,
they
would
have
to
be
shown
that
this
decree
should
be
imposed
on
general
host
and
not
merely
because
it
was
into
baking
business.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
i
don't
have
any
problem
with
that
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
because
they
--
i
think
an
injunction
is
applicable
to
not
only
to
the
parties,
but
anybody
in
proclivity
or
acting
in
consent
with
the
parties
and
under
the
circumstances
that
you
postulated
they
would
be
acting
in
consent.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
but
he
is
doing
in
privity
with
the
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
i
think
i
can
state
my
position
this
way.
that
to
the
extent
that
any
non-party
is
found
to
have
been
acting
in
concert
of
privity
with
a
party
whether
it
says
so
in
the
decree
or
it
doesn't
say
so
in
the
decree,
the
rules
make
such
a
privy
subject
to
the
injunction.
but
the
government
concedes
here
that
there
was
no
such
concert
and
that
there
was
no
such
privity
and
you're
talking,
they're
trying
to
make
the
decree
applicable
to
a
company
that
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
and
no
friendly
relations
with
any
defendant
and
i
think
that
this
is
carrying
an
equity
decree
far
beyond
this
scope
that
it
has
ever
been
carried
by
this
court
and
probably
ever
would
be
carried
by
this
court.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
i
don't
believe
that's
the
--
i
don't
believe
you
correctly
characterized
my
suggestion.
you're
talking
about
something
that
i
said
or
something
in
our
brief?
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
no.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
well,
that's
right.
it
may
not
be
realistic,
but
i
think
that's
the
only
thing
that
they
could
do
what
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
that's
right.
but
our
position
here
your
honor
is
this.
number
one,
that
the
decree
can't
be
interpreted
the
way
the
government
seeks
to
interpret
it
and
you
just
can't
turn
words
upside
down.
if
you
look
at
the
decree
as
in
this
writ,
the
decree
was
very,
very
carefully
framed.
and
it
is
not
a
structural
decree
per
se
as
mr.
springer
would
have
you
believe.
there
are
many
behavioral,
behavioral
provisions
in
the
decree.
there
were
three
types
of
defendants
in
this
case.
there
were
the
meatpacker
defendants,
there
were
individual
defendants
who
are
the
major
stockholders
in
the
meat
companies
and
there
were
some
50
subsidiaries
of
the
meat
companies
who
were
defendants.
this
was
a
--
there
were
quite
a
few
defendants
in
this
case.
now,
when
the
consent
decree
was
negotiated,
these
various
defendants
were
given
different
types
of
treatment,
the
provision
that
mr.
springer
referred
to,
two
of
them,
four
and
eight
specifically
referred
to
corporate
defendants.
paragraph
six
which
is
another
one
that
he
referred
to
applies
to
all
defendants
and
paragraph
five
of
the
decree
applies
to
individual
defendants.
now,
in
paragraph
five
of
the
decree,
the
individual
defendants,
the
people
who
were
then
in
control
of
the
meatpackers
were
permitted
to
own
stock
in
the
forbidden
businesses,
the
businesses
forbidden
to
the
meatpackers
and
they
were
permitted
to
own
up
to
50%
of
the
stock,
no
question
to
control
this
as
this
court
well
knows
that
you
can
control
a
company
with
much
less
than
50%
of
the
stock.
these
companies
were
permitted
to
engage
in
these
forbidden
businesses
and
there
was
an
injunctive
provision
which
says,
but
you
can't
use
them
in
a
way
that
would
help
either
armour
in
its
business
or
yourself
or
use
armour
in
a
way
to
help
you
in
your
business.
so,
that
this
decree
did
not
declare
a
complete
separation
as
the
government
says
of
the
business
of
meatpacking
from
substitute
foods.
it
said
only
this,
that
the
defendant
meatpackers,
the
defendant
meatpackers
and
that
is
the
way
that
the
language
of
the
decree
is,
the
packer
defendants,
corporate
defendants,
are
enjoined
from
doing
this.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can't
characterize
this
decree
as
a
prophylactic
structural
decree,
but
this
is
a
decree
that
was
arrived
at
by
negotiation
and
it
was
some
structure
and
some
behavioral
and
the
parties
knew
exactly
what
they
were
doing
and
they
did
not
intend
to
reach
the
situation.
maybe
they
weren't
aware
of
it,
maybe
it
didn't
occur
to
them,
but
obviously
they
didn't
intend
either
sub
silentio
or
actually
to
reach
the
situation
that
is
covered
here.
so
that,
in
effect
what
the
department
is
seeking
here
is
a
modification
of
the
decree
as
mr.
justice
white
indicated
and
i
might
add
here
that
the
department
has
construed
this
decree
in
the
past
the
same
way
that
we're
construing
it
now
because
they
have
--
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
decree
prohibits
the
packers
from
engaging
in
the
stockyard
business,
but
the
people
who
controlled
armour
before
general
host
acquired
the
control
of
armour
also
controlled
the
chicago
stockyards,
this
is
all
set
out
in
our
briefs.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
that's
the
prince
family,
yes
your
honor
and
our
brief
points
out
what
the
stock
holdings
were.
they
had
10%
to
15%
of
the
stock
and
there
was
a
cross
privilization
of
management
and
there
was
no
--
and
the
government
hasn't
contested
this.
and
the
government
has
said
in
connection
with
that
argument,
well
maybe
we
construed
the
decree
erroneously
before,
but
we're
doing
it
right
now.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
oh
no.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
he
thought
that
that
would
make
a
difference.
i
think
that
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
no,
but
i
think
what
he
went
on
to
say
however
that
he
did
not
find
that
control
itself
would
be
bad
and
that
if
general
host
abused
its
control
and
caused
armour
to
violate
the
decree
come
on
back,
and
i'll
enjoin
it
quick
as
a
flash,
but
mere
ownership
doesn't
cause
armour
to
violate
the
decree.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
well,
what
happened
--
there
are
a
couple
of
precedents
in
this
area.
one
is
this
court's
decision
in
the
hughes
case
where
the
government
sought
a
construction
of
the
decree
and
the
court
sent
it
back
and
said
that
this
was
an
attempt
to
modify
the
decree
and
that
an
appropriate
hearing
should
be
had
to
determine
whether
this
type
of
relief
is
necessary.
now,
i
think
we're
entitled
to
a
hearing
as
to
whether,
at
least
a
hearing,
as
to
whether
or
not
this
type
of
relief
is
necessary
to
effectuate
--
let
us
go
this
far,
i'm
just
conceding
this
for
argue
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
to
effectuate
what
the
government
claims
with
the
purposes
of
this
decree.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
the
purpose
of
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
no,
i
say
that
it
was
--
it
was
--
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
prevent
proven
or
admitted
violators
who
had
used
their
power
in
the
past
from
using
it
in
the
future
which
is
done
in
many,
many
antitrust
cases,
but
we
are
non-proven
violator
and
we
are
a
non-proven
violator
or
non-admitted
violator.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
oh
no,
i
don't
think
anything
in
this
decree,
anything
in
this
decree
prohibits
the
largest
beef
packer
in
the
country
today,
this
isn't
in
the
record
but
i
hope
you'll
pardon,
but
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
asked
this
question.
the
largest
beef
packer
in
the
united
states
today,
which
the
iowa
beef
company
is
not
subject
to
this
decree
and
it
can
go
out
and
acquire
general
host
any
day
it
wants.
now,
all
the
government
can
do
about
that
is
bring
a
section
7
case
and
i
think
that's
what
the
government
should
do
here.
if
they
think,
if
they
think
that
general
host
control
of
armour
constitutes
a
reasonable
probability
of
a
substantial
lessening
of
competition
in
any
line
of
commerce,
they
have
a
section
7
case.
they're
not
without
remedy
here,
even
apart
from
the
decree.
but
what
the
government
is
trying
to
do
here,
we
submit
your
honor
is
that
just
short
circuit
this
whole
business
probably
out
of
fear
that
they
can't
successfully
maintain
a
section
7
case
or
couldn't
successfully
maintain
the
burden
of
modifying
the
decree
which
is
a
heavy
burden
and
the
rule
of
which
had
been
laid
it
down
in
one
of
the
prior
decisions
in
this
case
and
to
avoid
that
burden
both
for
modification
and
for
proving
a
section
7
violation
they
have
adopted
this
arbitrary,
summary
procedure
or
seek
to
have
you
sanction
this
arbitrary
summary
procedure
which
deprives
general
host
of
its
day
in
court
and
we
submit
your
honor
that
this
is
not
an
appropriate
form
of
action
in
this
area,
thank
you.
