justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
think
if
you're
right
about
that,
you
don't
need
to
be
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
the
trial
judge
instructed
on
the
matter,
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
so
you
did
get
the
benefit
of
that
instruction,
did
you?
justice
potter
stewart
rightly
or
wrongly?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
rightly,
the
government
says
wrongly
although
you're
not
telling
us
that
it
was
at
the
government
requests?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
still,
i'm
sorry.
i
still
don't
follow
you.
if
you're
right
on
the
--
that
you're
not
with
--
that
you're
within
the
exception
under
the
statute
then
i
don't
understand
you,
why
would
it
be
a
constitutional
question?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
if
this
is
a
prosecution
that
is
for
violating
a
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
a
statute
which
says
it
can't
be
any
prosecution
if
you
fall
within
an
exception,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
you
fall
within
the
exception,
why
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
case,
you
couldn't
be
prosecuted,
you
couldn't
be
convicted?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
so
you're
up
against
a
jury
finding
that
that
you're
not
within
the
exception?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
gather
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute,
are
they?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
--
suppose
we
were
to
feel
that
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
there
was
no
issue
for
the
jury?
of
the
investigation?
justice
potter
stewart
that
should
fall
within
the
exception?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
awfully
anxious
to
get
a
constitutionalist,
you're
not
at
this,
aren't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not
as
concerned
to
get
your
fellow
off?
justice
potter
stewart
i
get
it
nice,
but
if
we
can
decide
that
it
has
come
within
the
exception,
that's
the
end
of
the
case,
isn't
it
if
your
man
is
off?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
but
if
that
says
it
should've
gone
to
the
jury
and
that
the
conviction
therefore
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
should
be
set
aside,
that's
the
end
of
the
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
when
--
sorry
to
interrupt
you
again
mr.
berg
but
when
you
told
that
my
brother
brennan
that
there
was
no
substantial
dispute
as
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
does
that
mean
that
you
do
concede
that
your
client
was
wearing
the
uniform
or
a
distinctive
part
thereof
of
any
of
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
has
to
be,
that
either
as
i
read
it,
it
has
to
be
the
uniform
which
i
suppose
would
mean
the
complete
uniform
or
a
distinctive
part
thereof,
isn't
that
what
the
statute
said?
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
--
do
you
or
don't
you
concede
that
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
khaki
colored
socks
for
instance
would
not
be
a
distinctive
part
of
the
army
uniform,
although
soldiers
do
wear
khaki
colored
socks.
justice
potter
stewart
or
a
handkerchief
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
maybe
under
--
an
under
short
or
underwear,
i
would
know
but
tan
shoes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
not
sure
--
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
you
because
--
and
i'm
not
sure
whether
--
that
i
understand
whether
you
do
or
whether
you
don't
concede
that
the
dress,
the
garment
in
which
the
petitioner
was
dressed
at
this
time
was
within
the
statutory
definition?
justice
potter
stewart
the
uniform
or
a
distinctive
part
of
there.
that's
what
the
statute
says
and
if
he
wasn't
of
course
he
wasn't
covered
by
the
statute
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
jury
must
have
found
that
he
was?
justice
potter
stewart
they
certainly
didn't
find
he
was
wearing
a
complete
uniform,
did
they?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
wasn't
any
evidence
at
all
or
whatsoever
that
he
was
wearing
an
entire
uniform?
justice
potter
stewart
or
a
distinctive
--
well
they
at
least
found
that
he
was
wearing
a
distinctive
part?
justice
potter
stewart
in
order
to
convict?
justice
potter
stewart
in
order
to
convict,
does
that
defines
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
eagle
--
you
said
an
eagle
turned
upside
down.
that's
the
insignia
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that's
not
only
out
of
commissioned
officer's
cap
in
the
united
state
army?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
--
is
that
company?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
--
i
suppose
there
is
and
would
you
know
if
there
is
other
federal
legislation
on
making
it
a
criminal
offense
to
impersonate
an
officer
or
an
enlisted
man
in
the
army?
i'm
not
very
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
is.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
there
is
such
a
narrow
--
more
narrowly
drawn
stand?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
indication
in
the
record
as
to
where
he
acquired
this
clothing?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
berg,
do
you
know
anything
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
of
this
legislation?
justice
potter
stewart
during
world
war
i.
justice
potter
stewart
any
history
relevant
that
you
could
find
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
you
--
the
words
you're
according
where
spoken
by
whom
and
when?
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
closing
argument
that
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
berg
with
the
respect
to
the
jurisdictional
question?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
going
to
rest
on
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
don't
see
any
difference
between
delay
of
under
90
days
and
one
over
90
days
with
respect
to
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
a
distinction
made
by
the
government
as
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
the
outside
limit
of
any
statutory
length
of
times
--
justice
potter
stewart
--the
government
submits
and
as
the
power
of
the
court
is
only
to
shorten
that
time
within
that
90
days?
that's
their
submission
roughly
as
i
understood.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
case
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
main
one
--
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
just
looking
at
the
index
of
your
brief
and
i
have
read
some
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what's
in
it?
justice
potter
stewart
cite
about
the
3447
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
right.
justice
potter
stewart
for
some
reason
mr.
solicitor
general,
i'm
having
difficulty
again
in
the
index
to
your
brief
i
can't
find
united
states
against
smith
under
either
united
states
or
smith.
justice
potter
stewart
but
for
the
time
--
justice
potter
stewart
could
you
let
me
have
citation
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
331-469?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
robinson.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general
may
i
ask.
am
i
correct
that
certiorari
in
civil
cases
is
governed
by
an
expressed
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
which
says
that
the
petition
in
civil
cases
must
be
filed
within
90
days
of
the
judgment,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
where
as
here
we're
dealing
with
the
criminal
case
where
we
have
no
comparable
explicit
statutes,
do
we?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
then
in
the
criminal
case
under
that
authority
we
might
prescribe
six
months
even
though
its
only
90
days
on
the
basis
of
this.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
did
you
suggest
--
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
suggest
over
here
that
there
are
maybe
12
or
15
cases
within
--
in
which
we
have
indeed
extended?
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
as
going
to
suggest
i
can
--
think
i
can
count
12
or
15
cases
in
the
less
couple
of
weeks?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
in
which
we
granted
review.
justice
potter
stewart
which
we
have
ignored
it?
justice
potter
stewart
where
we
granted
it,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
essence
i
gather
them
mr.
solicitor
general
is
then
if
we
prescribe
at
the
time
period
that
has
precisely
the
same
effect
as
if
it
had
been
written
into
enabling
law
itself?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
ask
if
the
time
coy
was
decided,
did
the
predecessor
of
rule
22,
read
as
rule
22
now
reads?
justice
potter
stewart
exactly
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
phrasing
was
the
same?
justice
potter
stewart
the
reason
i
asked
is
that's
rather
unusual
wording,
isn't
it?
it's
phrased
not
that
a
petition
is
out
of
time
unless
filed
within
90
days
but
that
a
petition
shall
be
deemed
in
time
when
filed
within
90
days.
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
go
on.
i
think
i
misunderstood
the
least
part
of
the
argument
in
your
brief
because
here
in
oral
argument
in
response
to
a
question
for
mr.
justice
black
you
said
that
your
argument,
jurisdictional
argument
would
be
precisely
the
same.
now
you
--
if
this
case
were
one
day
late
rather
than
over
100
days
late
and
i
gathered
from
page
18
of
your
brief.
well,
i
understand
you
make
that
as
your
basic
argument.
i'd
gather
it
from
page
18
in
your
brief
that
you
say
even
if
you
are
mistaken
about
the
one
day,
certainly,
if
the
delay
is
more
than
90
days
which
is
the
longest
time
allowed
by
the
statute
then
clearly
its
jurisdictional,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
or
three
months.
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
it?
90
days--
why
is
that?
justice
potter
stewart
beyond
90
days?
justice
potter
stewart
or
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you
then.
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
to
mr.
justice
brennan
that
you
thought
it
would
be
a
defiance
of
the
rule
making
body
if
the
courts
had
ruled
fix
two
years?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
conferring
role
making
power
indicates
that
it
was
to
enable
the
court
to
expedite?
justice
potter
stewart
that
hasted
it
beyond
90
days
and
shorter?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
indication
that
in
the
role
of
congress,
ever
know
of
the
errors
from
your
standpoint
which
the
court
had
been
quarrelling--
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
your
premise,
we've
been
violating
our
rules
in
other
aspect
namely,
we
have
numerous
applications
where
the
application
with
extension
is
not
filed
within
the
time
and
those
orders
and
outside
many
of
them.
i
thought
there
might
be
something
to
do
with
merits,
application
for
extension
granted
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
full
authority,
we
do
it
constantly?
justice
potter
stewart
it
might
be
the
power
created
by
article
3
itself
called
the
congressional
power
that
is
going
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
article
three
itself
and
i'm
reading
from
it,
says
the
supreme
court
shall
have
appellate
jurisdiction
both
as
to
law
and
fact
with
such
exceptions
and
under
such
regulations
as
the
congress
shall
make.
justice
potter
stewart
strict,
i
think
is
the
word
strict
constructions.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
on,
page
45
of
the
appendix
refers
to
exhibit
12
but
doesn't
contain
exhibit
12,
but
i
suppose
that's
in
the
original
record?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
will
be
on
the
original
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
demonstration
or
whatever
it
was,
there
would
have
been
a
meaning?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
would
have
been
completely
meaningless
and
unintelligible
if
everybody
had
been
in
civilian
clothes,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
petitioner
had
been
in
civilian
clothes
and
if
the
--
no
problem
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
think
if
you're
right
about
that,
you
don't
need
to
be
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
the
trial
judge
instructed
on
the
matter,
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
so
you
did
get
the
benefit
of
that
instruction,
did
you?
justice
potter
stewart
rightly
or
wrongly?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
rightly,
the
government
says
wrongly
although
you're
not
telling
us
that
it
was
at
the
government
requests?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
still,
i'm
sorry.
i
still
don't
follow
you.
if
you're
right
on
the
--
that
you're
not
with
--
that
you're
within
the
exception
under
the
statute
then
i
don't
understand
you,
why
would
it
be
a
constitutional
question?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
if
this
is
a
prosecution
that
is
for
violating
a
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
a
statute
which
says
it
can't
be
any
prosecution
if
you
fall
within
an
exception,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
you
fall
within
the
exception,
why
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
case,
you
couldn't
be
prosecuted,
you
couldn't
be
convicted?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
so
you're
up
against
a
jury
finding
that
that
you're
not
within
the
exception?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
gather
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute,
are
they?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
--
suppose
we
were
to
feel
that
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
there
was
no
issue
for
the
jury?
of
the
investigation?
justice
potter
stewart
that
should
fall
within
the
exception?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
awfully
anxious
to
get
a
constitutionalist,
you're
not
at
this,
aren't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not
as
concerned
to
get
your
fellow
off?
justice
potter
stewart
i
get
it
nice,
but
if
we
can
decide
that
it
has
come
within
the
exception,
that's
the
end
of
the
case,
isn't
it
if
your
man
is
off?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
but
if
that
says
it
should've
gone
to
the
jury
and
that
the
conviction
therefore
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
should
be
set
aside,
that's
the
end
of
the
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
when
--
sorry
to
interrupt
you
again
mr.
berg
but
when
you
told
that
my
brother
brennan
that
there
was
no
substantial
dispute
as
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
does
that
mean
that
you
do
concede
that
your
client
was
wearing
the
uniform
or
a
distinctive
part
thereof
of
any
of
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
has
to
be,
that
either
as
i
read
it,
it
has
to
be
the
uniform
which
i
suppose
would
mean
the
complete
uniform
or
a
distinctive
part
thereof,
isn't
that
what
the
statute
said?
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
--
do
you
or
don't
you
concede
that
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
khaki
colored
socks
for
instance
would
not
be
a
distinctive
part
of
the
army
uniform,
although
soldiers
do
wear
khaki
colored
socks.
justice
potter
stewart
or
a
handkerchief
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
maybe
under
--
an
under
short
or
underwear,
i
would
know
but
tan
shoes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
not
sure
--
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
you
because
--
and
i'm
not
sure
whether
--
that
i
understand
whether
you
do
or
whether
you
don't
concede
that
the
dress,
the
garment
in
which
the
petitioner
was
dressed
at
this
time
was
within
the
statutory
definition?
justice
potter
stewart
the
uniform
or
a
distinctive
part
of
there.
that's
what
the
statute
says
and
if
he
wasn't
of
course
he
wasn't
covered
by
the
statute
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
jury
must
have
found
that
he
was?
justice
potter
stewart
they
certainly
didn't
find
he
was
wearing
a
complete
uniform,
did
they?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
wasn't
any
evidence
at
all
or
whatsoever
that
he
was
wearing
an
entire
uniform?
justice
potter
stewart
or
a
distinctive
--
well
they
at
least
found
that
he
was
wearing
a
distinctive
part?
justice
potter
stewart
in
order
to
convict?
justice
potter
stewart
in
order
to
convict,
does
that
defines
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
eagle
--
you
said
an
eagle
turned
upside
down.
that's
the
insignia
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that's
not
only
out
of
commissioned
officer's
cap
in
the
united
state
army?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
--
is
that
company?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
--
i
suppose
there
is
and
would
you
know
if
there
is
other
federal
legislation
on
making
it
a
criminal
offense
to
impersonate
an
officer
or
an
enlisted
man
in
the
army?
i'm
not
very
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
is.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
there
is
such
a
narrow
--
more
narrowly
drawn
stand?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
indication
in
the
record
as
to
where
he
acquired
this
clothing?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
berg,
do
you
know
anything
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
of
this
legislation?
justice
potter
stewart
during
world
war
i.
justice
potter
stewart
any
history
relevant
that
you
could
find
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
you
--
the
words
you're
according
where
spoken
by
whom
and
when?
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
closing
argument
that
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
berg
with
the
respect
to
the
jurisdictional
question?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
going
to
rest
on
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
don't
see
any
difference
between
delay
of
under
90
days
and
one
over
90
days
with
respect
to
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
a
distinction
made
by
the
government
as
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
the
outside
limit
of
any
statutory
length
of
times
--
justice
potter
stewart
--the
government
submits
and
as
the
power
of
the
court
is
only
to
shorten
that
time
within
that
90
days?
that's
their
submission
roughly
as
i
understood.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
case
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
main
one
--
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
just
looking
at
the
index
of
your
brief
and
i
have
read
some
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what's
in
it?
justice
potter
stewart
cite
about
the
3447
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
right.
justice
potter
stewart
for
some
reason
mr.
solicitor
general,
i'm
having
difficulty
again
in
the
index
to
your
brief
i
can't
find
united
states
against
smith
under
either
united
states
or
smith.
justice
potter
stewart
but
for
the
time
--
justice
potter
stewart
could
you
let
me
have
citation
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
331-469?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
robinson.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general
may
i
ask.
am
i
correct
that
certiorari
in
civil
cases
is
governed
by
an
expressed
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
which
says
that
the
petition
in
civil
cases
must
be
filed
within
90
days
of
the
judgment,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
where
as
here
we're
dealing
with
the
criminal
case
where
we
have
no
comparable
explicit
statutes,
do
we?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
then
in
the
criminal
case
under
that
authority
we
might
prescribe
six
months
even
though
its
only
90
days
on
the
basis
of
this.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
did
you
suggest
--
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
suggest
over
here
that
there
are
maybe
12
or
15
cases
within
--
in
which
we
have
indeed
extended?
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
as
going
to
suggest
i
can
--
think
i
can
count
12
or
15
cases
in
the
less
couple
of
weeks?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
in
which
we
granted
review.
justice
potter
stewart
which
we
have
ignored
it?
justice
potter
stewart
where
we
granted
it,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
essence
i
gather
them
mr.
solicitor
general
is
then
if
we
prescribe
at
the
time
period
that
has
precisely
the
same
effect
as
if
it
had
been
written
into
enabling
law
itself?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
ask
if
the
time
coy
was
decided,
did
the
predecessor
of
rule
22,
read
as
rule
22
now
reads?
justice
potter
stewart
exactly
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
phrasing
was
the
same?
justice
potter
stewart
the
reason
i
asked
is
that's
rather
unusual
wording,
isn't
it?
it's
phrased
not
that
a
petition
is
out
of
time
unless
filed
within
90
days
but
that
a
petition
shall
be
deemed
in
time
when
filed
within
90
days.
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
go
on.
i
think
i
misunderstood
the
least
part
of
the
argument
in
your
brief
because
here
in
oral
argument
in
response
to
a
question
for
mr.
justice
black
you
said
that
your
argument,
jurisdictional
argument
would
be
precisely
the
same.
now
you
--
if
this
case
were
one
day
late
rather
than
over
100
days
late
and
i
gathered
from
page
18
of
your
brief.
well,
i
understand
you
make
that
as
your
basic
argument.
i'd
gather
it
from
page
18
in
your
brief
that
you
say
even
if
you
are
mistaken
about
the
one
day,
certainly,
if
the
delay
is
more
than
90
days
which
is
the
longest
time
allowed
by
the
statute
then
clearly
its
jurisdictional,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
or
three
months.
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
it?
90
days--
why
is
that?
justice
potter
stewart
beyond
90
days?
justice
potter
stewart
or
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you
then.
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
to
mr.
justice
brennan
that
you
thought
it
would
be
a
defiance
of
the
rule
making
body
if
the
courts
had
ruled
fix
two
years?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
conferring
role
making
power
indicates
that
it
was
to
enable
the
court
to
expedite?
justice
potter
stewart
that
hasted
it
beyond
90
days
and
shorter?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
indication
that
in
the
role
of
congress,
ever
know
of
the
errors
from
your
standpoint
which
the
court
had
been
quarrelling--
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
your
premise,
we've
been
violating
our
rules
in
other
aspect
namely,
we
have
numerous
applications
where
the
application
with
extension
is
not
filed
within
the
time
and
those
orders
and
outside
many
of
them.
i
thought
there
might
be
something
to
do
with
merits,
application
for
extension
granted
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
full
authority,
we
do
it
constantly?
justice
potter
stewart
it
might
be
the
power
created
by
article
3
itself
called
the
congressional
power
that
is
going
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
article
three
itself
and
i'm
reading
from
it,
says
the
supreme
court
shall
have
appellate
jurisdiction
both
as
to
law
and
fact
with
such
exceptions
and
under
such
regulations
as
the
congress
shall
make.
justice
potter
stewart
strict,
i
think
is
the
word
strict
constructions.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
on,
page
45
of
the
appendix
refers
to
exhibit
12
but
doesn't
contain
exhibit
12,
but
i
suppose
that's
in
the
original
record?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
will
be
on
the
original
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
demonstration
or
whatever
it
was,
there
would
have
been
a
meaning?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
would
have
been
completely
meaningless
and
unintelligible
if
everybody
had
been
in
civilian
clothes,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
petitioner
had
been
in
civilian
clothes
and
if
the
--
no
problem
--
