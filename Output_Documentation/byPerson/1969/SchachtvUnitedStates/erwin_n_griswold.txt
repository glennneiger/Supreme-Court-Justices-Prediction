mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
that
court.
i
will
direct
myself
first
to
the
jurisdictional
question
which
has
been
raised
in
the
government's
brief.
when
i
first
came
to
my
present
office
some
time
ago,
i
was
rather
surprised
to
find
occasional
briefs
coming
across
my
desk
in
which
it
said
the
petition
was
filed
out
of
time.
nevertheless,
there
is
no
reason
for
granting
certiorari
and
then
going
on
to
argue
the
question
of
certiorari.
i
raised
the
question
with
my
associates
and
they
said,
“oh,
it's
not
jurisdictional.”
and
i
was
puzzled
by
that,
but
there
are
lots
of
things
that
i
find
puzzling
and
don't
always
find
answers
to.
and
i
went
along
and
noticed
those
cases
continuing
until
this
case
came
when
the
court
granted
certiorari
131
days
after
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
and
i
couldn't
see
any
reason
why
if
they
could
grant
it
a
131
days,
it
couldn't
be
granted
at
1131
days
or
at
anytime
and
i
asked
my
associate
mr.
connelly
to
look
into
it
and
we
dug
into
it
rather
thoroughly
and
i
will
endeavor
to
summarize
here
what
we
found
in
looking
into
it.
of
course
there
was
originally
the
basic
statute
of
1925
which
provided
a
period
of
three
months
for
certiorari
with
respect
to
all
types
of
judgments
with
a
power
in
the
court
to
or
a
justice
at
the
court
to
extend
that
for
60
days
on
an
application
made
within
the
three
months
period.
and
then
in
1933,
congress
authorized
the
court
by
a
statute
which
says
that
the
court
shall
have
the
power
to
prescribe
and
i
think
prescribe
has
some
significance.
from
time
to
time,
rules
of
practice
and
i
think
rules
has
some
significance
and
by
an
amendment
made
in
1934,
it
was
provided
that
the
rules
made
as
here
in
authorized
may
prescribe
the
times
for
and
manner
of
taking
appeals
and
applying
for
writs
of
certiorari.
and
the
committee
reports
at
that
time
read
in
a
way
which
sounds
contemporary.
existing
rules
of
the
united
states,
district
courts
and
circuit
court
of
appeals
tend
themselves
to
delay.
many
cases
and
all
pending
in
the
federal
courts
for
months
and
even
years
have
elapsed
since
the
verdict
of
guilty.
and
the
cases
have
not
been
finally
disposed
of
in
the
united
states,
circuit
courts
of
appeals
and
the
accused
have
been
at
large
on
bail.
nothing
tends
more
to
discredit
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
than
such
delays.
there
was
an
article
by
professor
orfield
who
had
been
a
member
of
the
advisory
committee
on
the
criminal
rules
which
referred
to
the
time
limits
in
rule
11,
which
was
adopted
in
roman
xi
in
1934
and
which
fixed
a
single
period
of
30
days
referred
to
that
as
jurisdictional.
and
then
the
next
thing
that
happened
was
that
rather
to
my
surprise
and
due
to
the
very
careful
work
of
mr.
connelly,
we
find
that
the
very
question
was
decided
by
the
court
in
united
states
ex
rel.
coy
against
the
united
states
316
u.
s
342
where
a
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
more
than
30
days
after
the
judgment,
and
the
court
said
on
page
344,
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
too
late
and
we
are
without
jurisdiction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh
yes,
this
case
is
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
is
the
essence
of
our
brief
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
it's
under
united
states
ex
rel.
coy
i
believe
in
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice,
it's
under
coy,
it's
cited
on
pages
14
and
17
of
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
our
brief.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
the
court
also
referred
in
the
coy
opinion
saying
“since
the
purpose
in
adopting
the
rules
was
to
expedite
criminal
appeals
and
it
seems
rather
odd
that
the
nod
effect
in
this
case
has
been
a
very
substantial
delay
over
the
time
that
would
have
been
involved
where
the
rules
not
in
force.
now,
since
1934
when
rule
11
was
first
adopted,
the
rules
have
gone
through
various
changes.
in
1946,
the
language
was
changed
from
shall
to
may
and
someone
might
think
that
“well,
that's
just
permissive
and
that
means
it
isn't
really
binding”
it
says
beginning
in
1946,
it
said
“maybe
made
within
30
days”.
another
change
was
made
in
1946
which
was
to
grant
authority
to
a
justice
of
the
court
to
extend
the
time
not
exceeding
30
days.
if
the
application
was
made
“within
the
30
day
period
following
judgment”
and
the
advisory
committee
at
that
time
in
its
notes
said
“this
rule
continues
existing
law,
except
that
it
grants
to
the
supreme
court
or
a
justice
thereof
the
authority
to
extend
the
time."
and
of
course,
the
existing
law
included
not
only
the
text
to
the
rule
but
also
this
court's
decision
in
the
coy
case.
and
at
other
places
in
the
notes
to
the
preliminary
draft
of
the
rules
of
1946,
of
the
coy
case
is
cited
so
that
it
was
not
overlooked
and
this
court
several
times
in
per
curiam
decisions,
denying
petition
cited
the
coy
case.
the
next
case
we
have
is
united
states
against
smith.
smith
being
a
district
judge,
there
haven't
been
an
application
for
mandamus
against
him
which
the
court
of
appeals
had
refused
and
this
was
certiorari
to
this
court
to
review
the
court
of
appeals
refusal.
judge
smith
had
granted
a
new
trial
long
after
the
five
days,
put
in
the
rule,
he
tempted
to
justify
it
on
the
grounds
that
he
had
done
it
sue
sponte,
that
the
rule
simply
said
that
application
must
be
made
within
5
days
but
it
said
nothing
about
what
the
judge
did
himself.
but
this
court
reversed
the
court
of
appeals.
i
may
point
out
too
that
this
rule
with
respect
to
appeal
also
contain
the
may
language
which
was
introduced
in
1946
both
with
respect
to
appeals
and
with
respect
to
certiorari.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
then
the
index
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
is
sadly
deficient
and
indeed
mr.
justice,
it
may
not
be
in
the
brief.
it
maybe
results
to
some
of
my
subject
with
continued
research.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
331
u.
s
469
and
it
is
a
very
relevant
opinion
by
mr.
justice
jackson.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
331-469.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
court
held
that
mandamus
should
have
been
granted
to
require
the
district
judge
to
revoke
its
order
granting
a
new
trial.
and
there's
very
interesting
language
in
the
opinion
and
relevant
language
and
i
quote
“the
rules
in
abolishing
the
term
rule
did
not
substitute
indefiniteness,
the
policy
of
the
rules
was
not
to
extend
power
indefinitely
but
to
confine
it
within
constant
time
limits”
and
otherwise
said
mr.
justice
jackson
in
a
phrase
what
seems
to
me
to
be
very
relevant
here.
otherwise,
the
power
lingers
on
indefinitely
and
that
is
what
we
are
currently
confronted
with,
with
the
situation
as
it
now
stands.
now,
in
1954,
the
relevant
rules
were
transferred
to
the
rules
of
this
court.
on
rule
22,
paragraph
2
and
that's
where
they
are
now.
but
i
suggest
that
the
power
to
prescribe
them
is
not
derived
from
some
inherent
judicial
power
of
this
court
to
manage
its
own
business.
but
is
still
derived
from
the
acts
of
1933
and
1934
or
since
things
have
since
been
codified,
it
is
not
actually
18
united
states
code
section
3772
which
carries
forward
in
virtually
identical
language,
the
provisions
of
the
acts
of
1933
and
'34.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
i
would
say
under
my
argument
that
it
would
be
exactly
the
same.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
under
the
rule
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
after
the
time
or
the
time
as
extended
by
an
application
made
within
time
not
to
exceed
30
days
has
expired,
thus
the
course
would
be
entirely
without
prejudice
to
the
court
by
an
exercise
of
the
rule
making
power
to
provide
as
it
has
and
in
rule
4a
of
the
appellate
rules
the
court,
the
rules
of
appellate
procedure,
the
court
has
provided
that
upon
showing
of
excusable
neglect
the
district
court
may
extend
the
time
for
filing
the
notice
of
appeal
by
any
party
for
a
period
not
to
exceed
30
days
from
the
expiration
of
the
time
otherwise
prescribed
by
the
subdivision.
and
i
would
say,
i
don't
want
to
pass
upon
it
now
because
there
maybe
arguments
in
various
way
but
would
seem
to
me
to
be
entirely
appropriate
for
the
court
to
provide
by
rule
with
a
fixed
time
limit
for
an
extension
of
time
even
though
it
is
not
sought
within
the
time.
it
is
the
unlimited
open
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
mr.
justice,
stern
and
gresham
have
some
reference
to
this
and
i
gather
that
there
10
to
12
or
15
and
i
will
come
to
those
after
a
while.
some
state
criminal
appeals,
some
federal
ones,
indeed
i'm
putting
this
case
called
robison
against
united
states
in
390
u.
s,
i
confessed
error
in
the
case
in
which
the
petition
was
filed
one
or
two
days
late.
i
may
say
at
that
time
i
was
aware
of
it
but
one
or
two
days
didn't
upset
me
but
a
131
days,
i
found
a
rather
large
order
and
i
did
find
the
coy
case
which
seems
to
me
to
have
decided
the
question
and
my
suggestion
is
that
in
these
other
cases
the
court
has
slipped
or
fallen
or
drifted
or
lapsed
into
it
an
error
without
ever
having
focused
on
the
relevant
materials
which
i
am
trying
to
present
to
the
court
now.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
have
suspected
that,
nevertheless,
in
one
of
the
places
where
you
mr.
justice
have
referred
to
this
which
is
in
a
dissent
you
wrote
in
the
case
called
hicks
against
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
also
not
cited
in
my
brief
which
in
383
u.
s.
you
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
in
one
of
these
cases
where
you
have
written
an
opinion,
you
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
court
has
discretions
for
grant.
and
i
suggest
that
putting
it
on
discretion
is
in
effect
a
denial
of
the
fact
that
the
statutory
power
is
to
grant
rules
and
is
a
recognition
of
the
fact
that
this
is
not
done
pursuant
to
rule
and
is
something
which
i
think
perhaps
the
court
might
not
have
done
if
there
had
been
an
opportunity
for
full
briefing
and
argument.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh
mr.
justice,
it's
in
my
notes
here
and
i
--
it's
not
a
fix
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
coy.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
robinson
was
390
u.
s.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
with
an
extension
of
60
days.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
what
you
have
is
a
statute
authorizing
the
court
to
prescribe
by
rule,
the
time
and
i
am
suggesting
that
the
practice
which
has
grown
up
of
doing
this
on
an
open
ended
basis
does
not
comply
with
the
statutorily
authorization
to
prescribe
by
rule.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh
yes
mr.
justice,
i
suspect
that
you
could
prescribe
two
years
if
you
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
thought
that
was
appropriate
i
don't
advocate
it
but
i
would
think
that
would
come
within
the
terms
of
the
statutory
authorization.
i
would
not
think
you
could
properly
say
maybe
filed
at
any
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
think
that
is
prescribing
by
rules.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
stern
and
greshem
missed
them,
a
great
many
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
in
which
you
granted
review.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh
no,
there'd
been
many
more
cases
on
that
in
which
the
applications
have
been
filed
late.
i'm
more
referring
to
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
somewhere
between
12
and
20
would
be
my
estimate
of
what
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
where
you
have
granted
it
and
proceeded
to
hear
the
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice,
my
position
is
thought
the
court
has
the
power
to
change
the
rule
which
it
doesn't
have
power
to
change
the
statute
that
is
the
rule
making
power
is
a
continuing
power.
that
once
the
court
has
adopted
a
rule
that
is
a
piece
of
delegated
legislation,
that
is
made
pursuant
to
the
authority
granted
by
congress
and
what
is
now
found
in
18
u.
s
c.
3772.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
this
case
it
is
unilateral.
in
the
case
of
proceeding
after
verdict,
congress
has
given
to
the
court
power
to
prescribe
by
rule
the
times
for
filing
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
my
position.
i
think
that
that
was
what
was
contemplated
by
congress.
i
think
that's
what
the
words
prescribe
by
rule
mean.
that
was
clearly
the
understanding
of
the
informed
commentators
at
the
time.
professor
orfield,
for
example,
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
rule
is
jurisdictional
and
that
was
the
almost
contemporaneous
decision
of
this
court
in
the
coy
case.
now,
i
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
language
has
changed
to
may,
it
also
changed
to
may
with
respect
to
appeals
and
this
court
in
the
robinson
case
in
361
u.
s.,
it
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
involved
a
late
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal.
and
the
court
held
that
the
may
language
there
was
compulsory
that
the
appeal
with
the
appellant
court
got
not
jurisdiction
when
the
appeal
was
filed
more
than
five
days
late
and
it
quoted
with
approval
the
language
from
united
states
against
smith,
the
phrase
of
--
lingers
on
indefinitely.
and
in
concluding
its
opinion,
it
said
something
further
which
seems
to
me
to
be
relevant
here.
that
powerful
policy
argument
maybe
made
both
for
and
against
greater
flexibility
with
respect
to
the
time
for
taking
of
an
appeal
is
indeed
evident.
but
that
policy
question
involving
as
it
does
many
witty
and
conflicting
consideration
must
be
resolved
through
the
rule
making
process
and
not
by
judicial
decision.
if
by
that
process
the
courts
are
ever
given
power
to
extend
the
time
for
the
filing
on
a
notice
of
appeal
upon
a
finding
of
excusable
neglect,
it
seems
reasonable
to
think
that
some
definite
limitation
upon
the
time
within
which
they
may
do
so
would
be
prescribed.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
case
is
tolerably
clear.
the
purpose
of
the
rules
was
to
cut
down
delays
to
restrict
the
time.
congress
was
not
clear
just
how
much
would
be
workable
and
delegated
the
authority
to
cut
down
the
time
to
the
court.
and
then
there's
the
language
of
the
statutory
authorization
or
to
prescribe
by
rule.
and
then
there's
the
language
of
the
rules
themselves.
the
rules
provide
that
the
petition
should
be
filed
within
30
days,
they
provide
further
that
a
justice
may
extend
the
time
within
30
days.
and
then
there
is
a
very
interesting
further
provision
in
the
rules
of
the
court.
rule
34
says
that
whenever
any
justice
of
this
court
is
empowered
by
law
to
extend
the
time,
an
application
seeking
such
extension
must
be
presented
to
the
court
within
the
period
sought
to
be
extended.
and
there
its
must
not
may,
it
is
specific.
and
finally,
there
was
the
decision
of
this
court.
in
the
coy
case
in
316
u.
s.
and
in
the
smith
and
robinson
cases.
well
now,
what
happened
to
upset
this
clear
picture?
nothing
deliberate,
i
may
point
out
that
in
the
coy
case
in
the
order
granting
certiorari,
the
court
expressly
directed
the
attention
of
council
to
the
question
of
the
time
limit
involved
and
asked
that
that
question
be
briefed
and
it
was.
but
at
no
time
has
the
court
ever
had
briefing
an
argument
in
these
cases
in
which
certiorari
has
been
granted
after
the
time
that
this
is
filed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice,
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
it's
the
rule
11
of
the
1934
rules.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
read
exactly
the
same
except
for
the
change
of
shall
to
may
to
which
i
have
already
referred
and
to
the
fact
that
at
the
time
coy
was
decided,
there
was
no
part
to
extend
the
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that's
essentially
the
language
of
the
1925
act
with
respect
to
civil
cases
which
they
were
simply
carrying
forward.
now,
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh
yes
mr.
justice,
i
recognized
the
one
day
argument
is
a
hard
one
and
if
it's
too
hard
for
the
court
to
accept
i
will
fall
back
and
say
“well,
at
least
you
got
to
have
sometime
limit
on
it”
and
the
only
feasible
one
is
the
old
90
day
statutory
one
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--not
the
rules
which
were
designed
to
expedite
criminal
appeals.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
logically
i
stand
by
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
black
but
the
rules
are
jurisdictional.
they
now
provide
for
30
days,
plus
as
an
extension
of
30
days
if
by
the
expressed
terms
of
the
rules,
the
application
is
made
within
the
30
days.
and
if
that
is
the
ground
upon
which
i
stand,
if
the
court
won't
accept
that
ground.
i
do
say
that
certainly
they
should
not
be
construed
to
leave
a
completely
open
ended.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
beyond
and
if
it
isn't
completely
open
ended,
where
should
it
stop.
well,
it
seems
to
me
at
the
place
where
it
was
before
the
rules
came
in
to
the
picture
in
which
to
be
technical
was
three
months
rather
than
90
days
at
that
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
at
least
is
within
the
--
it
is
within
the
language
of
--
to
prescribe
by
rule
and
you
would
have
to
read
into
that
while
congress
couldn't
have
intended
that
the
court
would
enlarge
the
time
or
that
congress
was
meaning
was
that
the
court
should
shorten
the
time
and
that's
another
case
which
we
don't
have
here
and
my
guess
is
the
court
isn't
going
to
prescribe
a
rule
which
fixes
it
in
two
years.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
argue
in
an
advisory
committee
working
to
assist
this
court
in
the
rule
making
process
that
the
court
could
not
appropriately
make
a
rule
of
more
than
90
days.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
enables
the
court
to
expedite
the
decisions
in
criminal
cases.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
this
court
has
so
recognized.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
when
it
was
only
a
day
or
two
here
and
there
i
was
just
puzzled
but
i
didn't
think
it's
was
appropriate
to
report
to
congress
that
the
court
was
violating
its
rules.
when
this
case
came
along
we
as
i
say
dug
into
it
and
found
quite
a
lot.
the
court
fell
into
this
error
if
my
may
put
it
that
way
in
heflin
against
the
united
states
in
358
u.
s.
further
question
came
up
only
in
the
most
back
handed
way.
it
was
not
dealt
within
the
briefs
of
any
of
the
parties
and
it
is
dealt
within
a
footnote
in
the
courts
opinion
of
the
complete
text
of
which
is,
the
complete
text
of
which
is
“well
because
no
jurisdictional
statute
is
involved”
that's
all.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
mr.
justice,
if
so
i
apologize
for
the
time
of
the
court
i
had
taken
that
seems
to
me
that
if
that
was
the
over
ruling
of
the
coy
case,
that
the
coy
case,
the
coy
case
was
entitled
to
be
present
at
its
own
funeral.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
court
--
had
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
court
was
aware
of
the
coy
case
at
that
time
or
that
it
would
have
dealt
with
it
in
such
a
completely
summary
fashion.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
mr.
justice,
yes
there
were.
it's
terribly
hard
to
tell
just
what
had
happened
in
the
coy
case.
it's
a
very
intricate
decision
arising
in
criminal
procedure
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
decided
that
the
--
what
the
district
court
had
done
was
wrong
but
the
consequence
of
that
was
to
make
it
a
criminal
appeal
and
since
it
was
a
criminal
appeal,
it
was
too
late
because
it
was
filed
more
than
--
the
petitioner
filed
more
than
30
days
and
then
the
court
said
in
the
footnote
“but
a
majority
of
the
court
feels
that
in
order
to
avoid
security
because
it
was
pointed
out
that
they
could
go
back
in
the
district
court
and
start
over
again
and
raise
the
same
question
and
since
the
point
is
not
jurisdictional
that
they
would
hear
the
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
mr.
justice,
my
argument
would
extend
to
that.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
at
least
in
civil
cases
that
is
completely
unjustifiable
and
i
can
find
no
reason
why
it
isn't
equally
unjustifiable
in
terms
of
this
court's
own
rules.
and
now,
with
respect
to
all
of
these
things,
if
the
rules
so
construed
are
too
inflexible,
then
i
submit
that
the
change
should
come
through
the
rule
making
process
and
not
in
essence
by
an
acquiescence.
and
if
there
is
a
change
made
through
the
rule
making
process,
it
will
almost
certainly
have
an
eventual
time
limit
and
also
some
statement
of
the
grounds
or
considerations
on
which
such
an
extension
will
be
granted.
in
some
instances,
which
leaves
this
important
matter
wholly
at
large,
not
even
good
cause
shown
or
excuse
them
on
neglect
as
things
now
stand,
cannot
with
true
propriety
be
called
a
rule
and
it
is
only
the
power
to
prescribe
rules
which
congress
has
given
to
the
court
in
this
area.
incidentally
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
now
come,
it
was
the
taglianetti
case
in
394
u.s,
this
not
one
of
your
dissents,
where
again
in
a
footnote
and
wholly
conclusary,
the
court
said
the
time
limit
is
not
jurisdictional
citing
heflin
and
does
not
bar
our
exercise
of
discretion
to
consider
the
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
taglianetti,
its
394
u.s.
316
and
that
is
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
was
the
rules
of
practice
in
criminal
cases
before
verdict.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
which
included
because
of
a
special
provision
in
the
statute,
the
authority
of
the
court
to
prescribe
rules
fixing
the
time
for
taking
appeals
and
for
filing
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
rule
11
was
not.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
whole
set
of
rules
is
made
under
authority
of
the
--
granted
by
the
congress
to
the
court
to
make
rules
its
own
and
that
was
not
placed
before
a
congress
and
that
has
been
true
all
the
way
along.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
for
a
while
it
was
in
both
places.
it
was
in
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
by
way
of
a
cross
reference.
it
was
in
rule
37
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
until
1967
or
1968
when
the
court
abrogated
rule
37,
and
since
that
time
it
has
been
exclusively
in
the
rules
of
this
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
by
way
of
a
cross
reference
mr.
justice,
rule
37
(2).
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
those
three
captors
of
those
rules
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
were
not
laid
before
the
congress.
there
was
a
complicated
submission
by
which
all
of
the
rules
except
these
three
chapters
were
laid
before
congress
but
these
three
chapters
relating
to
appeals
were
prescribed
by
the
court
effective
on
the
same
day
as
the
rules
laid
before
congress
became
effective.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice
i
apologize
for
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
was
quite
wrong.
it
was
the
hicks
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
was
the
one
in
which
you
referred
to
heflin
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
and
said
that
it
was
not
jurisdictional.
taglianetti
was
a
per
curiam
and
i
wouldn't
know
who
wrote
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
that
only
applies
to
rules
which
are
made
by
the
court
acting
pursuant
to
a
grant
of
authority
given
by
a
congress
to
act
in
essentially
a
legislative
manner.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
be
restricted
to
any
rules
made
pursuant
to
the
power
originally
granted
in
1933-34
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
and
now
granted
by
title
18
u.s.
code
section
3772.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
mr.
justice
i
don't
think
so.
although
insofar
as
it
does
deal
with
rules
which
have
been
laid
before
a
congress
which
includes
the
whole
business
of
rules
of
civil
procedure.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
would
only
be
with
respect
to
those
rules
of
this
court
which
i
made
pursuant
to
a
grant
of
power
by
congress.
and
i
would
not
suggest
that
it
would
be
claimed
that
this
court
had
power
to
fix
the
time
for
filing
petition
for
certiorari
or
to
take
appeals
simply
out
of
its
inherent
power.
but
that
that
part
has
never
been
thought
to
come
to
the
court
except
pursuant
to
the
grant
which
congress
has
made.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
a
grant
of
delegated
legislation.
it's
a
nice
problem
in
separation
of
powers
but
is
one
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i've
got
over
being
puzzled
by
that
one.
i
used
to
be
puzzled
somewhat
but
i
can
accept
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh,
yes
mr.
justice.
i
would
assume
that
it
was.
this
is
a
part
of
the
power
of
congress
to
make
law
as
long
since
established
that
congress
can
do
that
in
certain
cases
and
under
proper
conditions
by
delegating
it
to
other
governmental
bodies
and
is
most
appropriate
that
this
particular
item
should
be
delegated
to
this
court.
but
what
this
court
does
pursuant
to
that
power
is
essentially
legislative
and
our
submission
is
that
it
should
be
so
treated
and
perhaps
most
important
of
all
that
this
court
so
decided
in
the
coy
case
and
has
never
since
decided
to
the
contrary
with
any
indication
of
treatment
of
the
issues
in
the
problem
or
of
the
continuing
validity
of
the
coy
case
itself.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
in
this
case,
the
regulation
of
the
congress
has
made
has
been
to
delegate
this
to
the
court
but
i
suggest
that
the
congress
never
contemplated
that
that
was
a
simply
open
ended
delegation
whenever
the
court
thinks
in
its
a
good
discretion
that
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
take
the
case
than
it
shall
which
is
near
as
i
can
see
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh,
i
don't
know
mr.
justice.
it
depends
on
how
you
define
restrictive.
i
can
define
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
not.
i
think
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
even
strict
construction
is
i
think
believe
in
a
certain
measure
of
flexibility
and
that
flexibility
is
one
which
we
not
only
have
been
able
to
live
with
but
which
we
have
come
to
accept.
we
find
it
more
frequently
of
course
in
delegations
to
administrative
bodies,
but
in
this
area
it's
most
appropriate
that
there
be
a
delegation
to
the
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
didn't
start
the
merits
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
know
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
seems
to
me
that
and
what
has
been
done
in
this
case,
the
court
can
if
in
its
discretion
whatever
that
means,
it
think
it
appropriate,
it
can
grant
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
any
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
made
at
anytime
in
the
past
which
isn't
moot
for
some
reasons
or
other.
and
that
i
don't
think
was
contemplated
by
congress
and
yet
i
think
that's
what's
involved
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
that
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
and
i
don't
really
know
much
about
that--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
remember
what
the
time
limit
would
be.
there
are
bills
of
review
which
people
found
when
there
had
been
corruption
in
the
courts
and
they
upset
judgments
long
after
the
event,
and
in
equity,
you
can
do
a
lot
of
remarkable
things.
professor
chafe,
he
taught
me
that
long
ago
but
i
don't
--
this
particular
writ
of
certiorari
is
a
pretty
--
pretty
technical
term
of
art
which
i
don't
think
comes
within
those
others.
well
now,
with
respect
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
the
first
is
the
constitutional
validity
of
title
18
section
702
and
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
how
there
can
be
any
doubt
about
this.
this
is
the
provision
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
for
an
unauthorized
person
to
wear
the
uniform
or
any
distinctive
part
there
of
it.
incidentally,
let
me
clear
up
one
possible
misconception
which
came
from
the
petitioner's
argument.
he
suggested
that
there
might
be
a
simulation
of
the
uniform
here
but
actually
the
indictment
is
simply
that
he
did
wear
a
distinctive
part
of
the
official
uniform
and
the
trial
was
conducted
throughout
on
the
basis
that
he
wore
a
distinctive
part
of
the
uniform.
there
is
no
basis
for
saying
that
it
was
something
which
simulated
the
uniform.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
now
in
that
connection,
i
would
call
attention
to
page
45
and
46
of
the
appendix
where
an
exhibit
12
was
introduced
in
the
trial,
read
to
the
jury,
official
army
regulation
and
on
page
46
about
two
inches
down
in
quotation
marks,
the
following
uniforms
and
articles
thereof
for
a
male
members
of
the
united
states
army
are
distinct.
distinctive
components
of
the
uniforms
are
limited
to
caps,
coats,
jackets
and
trousers
except
as
indicated.
so
that
the
socks
and
the
handkerchiefs
are
out,
even
shoes
are
out.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
this
is
the
quotation
from
exhibit
12.
exhibit
12
is
the
regulation
and
this
is
a
quotation
from
exhibit
12.
i
don't
have
exhibit
12
in
my
hand
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
indeed
i
haven't
examined
it.
i
believe
this
to
be
a
quotation
from
exhibit
12
which
it
purports
to
be.
i
would
also
point
out
that
further
down
on
the
page
that
buttons
are
referred
to
and
i
would
also
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
on
page
13
an
fbi
agent
testified
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
page
13
of
the
appendix.
in
response
to
the
question,
would
you
just
describe
the
jacket
he
had
on
when
you
saw
him?
a
green
jacket
with
a
brass
buttons
of
the
type
issued
associated
with
military
uniforms
and
you
note
that
jackets
are
one
of
the
things
that
are
a
distinctive
part.
and
then
on
page
20,
a
us
army
colonel
at
page,
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
on
his
head
he
had
the
fur
filled
army
officer's
cap
with
the
loose
strap
--
with
the
strap
loose
and
hanging
down
and
with
an
army
officer's
insignia
upside
down.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
i
believe
by
some
stretch
of
the
imagination
mr.
justice
is
a
theatrical
production.
we
will
argue
here
later
that
it
is
not
--
that
this
was
not
that
--
of
course
is
given
under
circumstances
and
in
a
situation
where
everyone
present
knows
that
it
is
simulated.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
given
in
washington,
which
is
close
to
the
pentagon
and
where
other
things
have
happened.
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
that
is
a
simulation
and
here
there
was
a
considerable
reason
to
doubt
whether
the
person
involved
was
or
was
not
a
member
of
the
armed
forces.
now,
the
petitioner
here,
perhaps
his
oral
argument
belies
this
but
as
i
read
his
brief,
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
made
no
claim
that
he
didn't
come
within
the
terms
of
the
statute
that
is
that
he
was
wearing
a
distinctive
part
of
the
uniform.
it
seems
to
me
to
leave
no
question
which
was
not
in
substance
coved
by
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
against
o'brien,
the
case
involving
the
burning
of
the
draft
card.
surely,
there
is
power
in
congress
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
uniform
of
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
this
is
a
matter,
which
is
of
importance
not
only
to
the
army
but
also
to
citizens.
we
have
to
be
able
to
rely
on
the
fact
when
we
see
a
policeman
that
he
is
a
policeman.
and
these
times,
we
have
to
be
able
to
rely
on
the
fact
when
we
see
a
man
in
military
uniform
that
he
is
a
member
of
the
military.
the
constitution
expressly
gives
to
congress
the
power
to
raise
and
maintain
armies
and
to
do
all
things
necessary
and
proper
to
carry
that
power
into
effect.
and
surely
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
mr.
justice,
you
will
almost
always
find
that
the
buttons
have
been
removed.
that
seems
to
be
the
convention
in
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
if
i
can
get
to
that
case
soon
enough,
maybe
i
could
exercise
some
prosecutorial
discretion
with
respect
to
that
case.
this
--
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
situation
where
discretion
might
be
appropriate.
in
this
case,
where
the
prosecutor
exercises
the
discretion
otherwise
and
where
two
courts
below
have
sustained
that,
i
found
no
effective
way
that
i
could
proceed
except
by
defending
the
actions
which
they
have
taken.
this
court
in
united
states
against
bernal,
which
involved
a
prosecution
for
impersonating
an
officer,
a
cognate
question
said
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
such
statute
is
to
maintain
the
general
good
repute
and
dignity
of
the
service
itself.
and
this
is
essentially
an
argument,
which
i
made
somewhat
against
the
advise
of
some
of
my
associates
in
the
o'brien
case,
where
i
contended
that
it
was
within
the
power
of
congress
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
in
connection
with
the
power
given
to
raise
and
defend
armies,
to
protect
the
dignity
of
the
selective
service
process
by
making
it
a
crime
to
burn
draft
cards.
i
did
that
because
i
found
it
somewhat
difficult
myself
to
find
that
draft
cards
themselves
were
of
very
great
importance
in
the
process.
the
court
took
the
latter
ground
in
its
opinion
and
thus
the
o'brien
case
is
not
a
decision
on
that
point
but
i
think
that
the
decision
reads
is
very
close
to
the
one
which
is
involved
here.
so
our
position
would
be
that
the
criminal
code
provision
is
constitutional
and
that
the
defendant
clearly
came
within
it
and
was
properly
found
by
the
jury
to
have
come
within
it.
and
so
we
come
to
the
exemption
in
10
u.
s.
code
772
(f)
and
our
contention
is
that
the
petitioner
was
not
by
any
reasonable
stretch
of
the
interpretation
of
the
words
in
that
statute
an
actor
in
a
theatrical
or
motion
picture
production.
now
obviously,
it
wasn't
motion
picture
so
you
can
throw
that
out.
so
you
have
to
make
him
an
actor
in
a
theatrical
production.
now
originally,
this
statute
we
spelled
out
the
history
of
such
as
it
is
in
our
brief.
the
statute
prohibited
any
person
from
wearing
the
uniform
in
any
playhouse
or
theater
or
in
moving
picture
films.
and
it
was
codified
i
think
in
1954
and
the
sponsors
emphasized
that
no
substantive
change
was
intended.
the
objective
was
to
make
it
plain
that
television
performances
would
be
covered,
which
might
not
come
within
playhouse
or
theatre.
but
the
intention
of
congress
is
manifested
in
the
original
language
and
in
the
revision
and
that
is
that
it
is
confined
to
situations
where
the
make
believe
role
of
the
person
wearing
the
uniform
is
clear
from
the
setting.
thus,
it
seems
to
me
that
dr.
strangelove
or
the
(inaudible)
mutiny
come
within
it
because
everybody
knows
that's
a
simulation.
it
doesn't
mean
that
a
performance
must
be
given
in
the
building,
could
be
an
outdoor
theatre,
could
be
an
area
set
aside
for
it.
it
means
only
that
the
performance
wherever
given
must
preserve
some
of
the
traditional
characteristics
of
dramatic
presentation
such
as
the
defined
area
set
apart
for
the
actors
and
an
audience
surprised
that
the
events
which
they
observed
are
portrayed
and
not
real.
the
skit
here
was
not
a
theatrical
production
in
any
reasonable
meaning
of
that
term.
it
was
an
intermittent
event
in
a
demonstration
in
the
street,
in
front
of
an
induction
station
that
also
included
picketing
and
distributing
leaflets.
pedestrians
and
motorists
who
either
stopped
or
passed
by
the
demonstrating
could
reasonably
believe
that
the
petitioner
was
in
fact
a
soldier
as
his
wearing
of
distinctive
parts
of
the
uniform
was
intended
to
convey.
the
petitioner's
conduct
here
has
all
the
elements
of
picketing
and
no
real
similarity
to
the
theatrical
production
which
congress
contemplated,
and
no
one
would
suggest
i
believe
that
a
person
would
be
entitled
without
authority
to
wear
the
uniform
of
the
army
merely
because
he
was
picketing.
to
seek
to
bring
the
petitioner's
action
here
within
the
statutory
language
is
pressing
that
language
to
it's
dryly
logical
extreme
or
to
use
of
another
passage
from
homes
of
being
led
by
technical
definition
to
apply
a
certain
name
and
then
to
deduce
consequences
which
have
no
relation
to
the
grounds
on
which
the
name
was
applied.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
and
because
of
that,
we
--
since
we
think
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
what
he
did
does
not
come
within
the
exemption
in
the
statute.
but
the
qualification
on
that
exemption
about
tending
to
discredit
the
armed
forces
is
irrelevant.
this
is
a
little
like
for
example,
the
lopez
case
which
involved
the
defense
of
entrapment
and
the
contention
was
made
that
the
charge
about
entrapment
was
not
quite
right
and
the
court
held
where
it
wasn't
necessary
to
decide
that
because
as
a
matter
of
law,
there
wasn't
any
entrapment
and
he
wasn't
entitled
to
any
charge
with
respect
to
entrapment.
and
we
would
contend
here
that
the
defendant
was
not
entitled
to
any
charge
with
respect
to
the
defense
of
actor
in
a
theatrical
production
and
therefore
the
question
of
discredit
becomes
irrelevant.
i
would
be
prepared
myself
to
defend
a
discredit
exception
to
the
exception
to
the
statute
if
it
was
necessary
although
i
agree
that
it's
getting
very
close
to
the
line
but
on
grounds
similar
to
those
which
were
involved
in
the
o'brien
case
with
respect
to
the
draft
cards.
an
analogy
is
the
copyright
law.
after
all
the
uniform
is
the
uniform
of
the
united
states
and
the
united
states
is
entitled
to
have
some
control
over
the
way
in
which
it
is
used.
but
as
i
have
contended,
the
petitioner
doesn't
come
within
the
exception
in
any
of
the
exemption
in
any
event.
all
that's
happened
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
here
was
that
the
petitioner
received
the
benefit
of
the
defense
to
which
he
was
not
entitled.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh,
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
it
was
part
of
the
demonstration.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
and
had
he
simply
stood
outside
and
made
a
speech
against
the
war
in
vietnam
wearing
the
uniform,
i
cannot
see
any
basis
upon
which
the
fact
that
he
was
making
a
speech
would
entitle
him
to
exemption
from
the
statute,
which
makes
it
a
defense
to
wear
the
uniform
of
the
united
states
without
authority.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
court
said,
this
is
page
337
of
the
transcript,
was
the
portrayal
without
reference
to
the
fact
you
had
on
full
uniform
calculated
to
discredit
the
army
or
the
armed
forces.
the
witness,
i
think
the
uniform
showed
disapproval
and
my
intentions
were
to
show
my
disapproval
of
the
actions
of
the
army.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
there's
some
evidence
that
they
rehearsed
this
skit,
if
you
can
call
it
a
skit.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i
think
it's
reaching
quite
a
bit
to
call
it
even
a
skit
which
isn't
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
don't
think
so
and
they
could
have
worn
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
could
have
worn
other
types
of
uniforms.
you
can
get
uniforms
other
than
the
uniform
of
the
united
states
army
from
theatrical
supply
houses
if
there
had
been
some
theatrics
here
they
might
have
done
something.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
i
think
not.
i
think
to
be
a
theatrical
performance
you
have
to
have
something
like
a
stage.
i
don't
mean
indoors,
i
don't
mean
formal
but
you
have
to
have
some
place
where
there
are
players
and
some
place
where
there
is
an
audience.
and
this
was
in
essence
a
demonstration
not
a
theatrical
performance.
our
position
would
be
that
as
a
matter
of
law
this
was
not
a
theatrical
performance.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh,
yes,
yes.
where
you
--
what
we
have
put
in
to
our
brief
essentially
is
a
separate
place
for
the
players
and
circumstances
under
which
it
is
evident
that
it
is
a
simulation
and
not
actual
effect.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
but
whether
the
person
was
or
was
not
a
member
of
the
armed
forces.
was
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
was
the
important
part
of
it
and
there
was
nothing
here
to
indicate
that
he
was
not
a
member
of
the
armed
forces.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
there
was
some
kind
of
an
indication
that
it
was
a
play.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
have
helped
in
this
case
but
indeed,
if
he
had
had
a
sign
of
in
his
back
not
a
member
of
the
army,
that
might
have
made
it
enough
so
that
the
jacket
was
not
a
distinctive
part
of
the
uniform,
i
don't
know,
we're
very
close
to
the
line
in
each
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
of
course
that's
part
of
the
problem.
the
government
tries
to
protect
itself
in
various
ways
and
then
whatever
you
do
is
either
speech
or
a
symbolic
speech
and
the
first
amendment
completely
engulfs
it
and
the
government's
powers
are
sharply
restricted.
now
obviously,
there
is
a
line,
a
very
important
line
and
a
difficult
line
but
it's
perfectly
plain.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
protest
could
be
made
and
could
be
made
without
interference
at
that
place,
at
that
time,
the
problem
was
the
making
it
in
the
way
in
which
it
was
made
regardless
of
the
place
and
the
time,
including
the
wearing
of
the
uniform
which
congress
for
more
than
50
years
has
made
it
an
offense
when
not
authorized.
well,
our
first
submission
is
that
the
court
should
dismiss
this
petition
as
having
been
granted
without
jurisdiction.
if
we
are
not
successful
on
that
and
i
hope
that
we
will
be
because
i'm
greatly
troubled
by
the
un-open
ended
situation
in
which
we
now
are
that
the
decision
below
on
the
merit
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
no
sir.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
that
court.
i
will
direct
myself
first
to
the
jurisdictional
question
which
has
been
raised
in
the
government's
brief.
when
i
first
came
to
my
present
office
some
time
ago,
i
was
rather
surprised
to
find
occasional
briefs
coming
across
my
desk
in
which
it
said
the
petition
was
filed
out
of
time.
nevertheless,
there
is
no
reason
for
granting
certiorari
and
then
going
on
to
argue
the
question
of
certiorari.
i
raised
the
question
with
my
associates
and
they
said,
“oh,
it's
not
jurisdictional.”
and
i
was
puzzled
by
that,
but
there
are
lots
of
things
that
i
find
puzzling
and
don't
always
find
answers
to.
and
i
went
along
and
noticed
those
cases
continuing
until
this
case
came
when
the
court
granted
certiorari
131
days
after
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
and
i
couldn't
see
any
reason
why
if
they
could
grant
it
a
131
days,
it
couldn't
be
granted
at
1131
days
or
at
anytime
and
i
asked
my
associate
mr.
connelly
to
look
into
it
and
we
dug
into
it
rather
thoroughly
and
i
will
endeavor
to
summarize
here
what
we
found
in
looking
into
it.
of
course
there
was
originally
the
basic
statute
of
1925
which
provided
a
period
of
three
months
for
certiorari
with
respect
to
all
types
of
judgments
with
a
power
in
the
court
to
or
a
justice
at
the
court
to
extend
that
for
60
days
on
an
application
made
within
the
three
months
period.
and
then
in
1933,
congress
authorized
the
court
by
a
statute
which
says
that
the
court
shall
have
the
power
to
prescribe
and
i
think
prescribe
has
some
significance.
from
time
to
time,
rules
of
practice
and
i
think
rules
has
some
significance
and
by
an
amendment
made
in
1934,
it
was
provided
that
the
rules
made
as
here
in
authorized
may
prescribe
the
times
for
and
manner
of
taking
appeals
and
applying
for
writs
of
certiorari.
and
the
committee
reports
at
that
time
read
in
a
way
which
sounds
contemporary.
existing
rules
of
the
united
states,
district
courts
and
circuit
court
of
appeals
tend
themselves
to
delay.
many
cases
and
all
pending
in
the
federal
courts
for
months
and
even
years
have
elapsed
since
the
verdict
of
guilty.
and
the
cases
have
not
been
finally
disposed
of
in
the
united
states,
circuit
courts
of
appeals
and
the
accused
have
been
at
large
on
bail.
nothing
tends
more
to
discredit
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
than
such
delays.
there
was
an
article
by
professor
orfield
who
had
been
a
member
of
the
advisory
committee
on
the
criminal
rules
which
referred
to
the
time
limits
in
rule
11,
which
was
adopted
in
roman
xi
in
1934
and
which
fixed
a
single
period
of
30
days
referred
to
that
as
jurisdictional.
and
then
the
next
thing
that
happened
was
that
rather
to
my
surprise
and
due
to
the
very
careful
work
of
mr.
connelly,
we
find
that
the
very
question
was
decided
by
the
court
in
united
states
ex
rel.
coy
against
the
united
states
316
u.
s
342
where
a
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
more
than
30
days
after
the
judgment,
and
the
court
said
on
page
344,
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
too
late
and
we
are
without
jurisdiction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh
yes,
this
case
is
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
is
the
essence
of
our
brief
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
it's
under
united
states
ex
rel.
coy
i
believe
in
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice,
it's
under
coy,
it's
cited
on
pages
14
and
17
of
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
our
brief.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
the
court
also
referred
in
the
coy
opinion
saying
“since
the
purpose
in
adopting
the
rules
was
to
expedite
criminal
appeals
and
it
seems
rather
odd
that
the
nod
effect
in
this
case
has
been
a
very
substantial
delay
over
the
time
that
would
have
been
involved
where
the
rules
not
in
force.
now,
since
1934
when
rule
11
was
first
adopted,
the
rules
have
gone
through
various
changes.
in
1946,
the
language
was
changed
from
shall
to
may
and
someone
might
think
that
“well,
that's
just
permissive
and
that
means
it
isn't
really
binding”
it
says
beginning
in
1946,
it
said
“maybe
made
within
30
days”.
another
change
was
made
in
1946
which
was
to
grant
authority
to
a
justice
of
the
court
to
extend
the
time
not
exceeding
30
days.
if
the
application
was
made
“within
the
30
day
period
following
judgment”
and
the
advisory
committee
at
that
time
in
its
notes
said
“this
rule
continues
existing
law,
except
that
it
grants
to
the
supreme
court
or
a
justice
thereof
the
authority
to
extend
the
time."
and
of
course,
the
existing
law
included
not
only
the
text
to
the
rule
but
also
this
court's
decision
in
the
coy
case.
and
at
other
places
in
the
notes
to
the
preliminary
draft
of
the
rules
of
1946,
of
the
coy
case
is
cited
so
that
it
was
not
overlooked
and
this
court
several
times
in
per
curiam
decisions,
denying
petition
cited
the
coy
case.
the
next
case
we
have
is
united
states
against
smith.
smith
being
a
district
judge,
there
haven't
been
an
application
for
mandamus
against
him
which
the
court
of
appeals
had
refused
and
this
was
certiorari
to
this
court
to
review
the
court
of
appeals
refusal.
judge
smith
had
granted
a
new
trial
long
after
the
five
days,
put
in
the
rule,
he
tempted
to
justify
it
on
the
grounds
that
he
had
done
it
sue
sponte,
that
the
rule
simply
said
that
application
must
be
made
within
5
days
but
it
said
nothing
about
what
the
judge
did
himself.
but
this
court
reversed
the
court
of
appeals.
i
may
point
out
too
that
this
rule
with
respect
to
appeal
also
contain
the
may
language
which
was
introduced
in
1946
both
with
respect
to
appeals
and
with
respect
to
certiorari.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
then
the
index
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
is
sadly
deficient
and
indeed
mr.
justice,
it
may
not
be
in
the
brief.
it
maybe
results
to
some
of
my
subject
with
continued
research.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
331
u.
s
469
and
it
is
a
very
relevant
opinion
by
mr.
justice
jackson.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
331-469.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
court
held
that
mandamus
should
have
been
granted
to
require
the
district
judge
to
revoke
its
order
granting
a
new
trial.
and
there's
very
interesting
language
in
the
opinion
and
relevant
language
and
i
quote
“the
rules
in
abolishing
the
term
rule
did
not
substitute
indefiniteness,
the
policy
of
the
rules
was
not
to
extend
power
indefinitely
but
to
confine
it
within
constant
time
limits”
and
otherwise
said
mr.
justice
jackson
in
a
phrase
what
seems
to
me
to
be
very
relevant
here.
otherwise,
the
power
lingers
on
indefinitely
and
that
is
what
we
are
currently
confronted
with,
with
the
situation
as
it
now
stands.
now,
in
1954,
the
relevant
rules
were
transferred
to
the
rules
of
this
court.
on
rule
22,
paragraph
2
and
that's
where
they
are
now.
but
i
suggest
that
the
power
to
prescribe
them
is
not
derived
from
some
inherent
judicial
power
of
this
court
to
manage
its
own
business.
but
is
still
derived
from
the
acts
of
1933
and
1934
or
since
things
have
since
been
codified,
it
is
not
actually
18
united
states
code
section
3772
which
carries
forward
in
virtually
identical
language,
the
provisions
of
the
acts
of
1933
and
'34.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
i
would
say
under
my
argument
that
it
would
be
exactly
the
same.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
under
the
rule
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
after
the
time
or
the
time
as
extended
by
an
application
made
within
time
not
to
exceed
30
days
has
expired,
thus
the
course
would
be
entirely
without
prejudice
to
the
court
by
an
exercise
of
the
rule
making
power
to
provide
as
it
has
and
in
rule
4a
of
the
appellate
rules
the
court,
the
rules
of
appellate
procedure,
the
court
has
provided
that
upon
showing
of
excusable
neglect
the
district
court
may
extend
the
time
for
filing
the
notice
of
appeal
by
any
party
for
a
period
not
to
exceed
30
days
from
the
expiration
of
the
time
otherwise
prescribed
by
the
subdivision.
and
i
would
say,
i
don't
want
to
pass
upon
it
now
because
there
maybe
arguments
in
various
way
but
would
seem
to
me
to
be
entirely
appropriate
for
the
court
to
provide
by
rule
with
a
fixed
time
limit
for
an
extension
of
time
even
though
it
is
not
sought
within
the
time.
it
is
the
unlimited
open
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
mr.
justice,
stern
and
gresham
have
some
reference
to
this
and
i
gather
that
there
10
to
12
or
15
and
i
will
come
to
those
after
a
while.
some
state
criminal
appeals,
some
federal
ones,
indeed
i'm
putting
this
case
called
robison
against
united
states
in
390
u.
s,
i
confessed
error
in
the
case
in
which
the
petition
was
filed
one
or
two
days
late.
i
may
say
at
that
time
i
was
aware
of
it
but
one
or
two
days
didn't
upset
me
but
a
131
days,
i
found
a
rather
large
order
and
i
did
find
the
coy
case
which
seems
to
me
to
have
decided
the
question
and
my
suggestion
is
that
in
these
other
cases
the
court
has
slipped
or
fallen
or
drifted
or
lapsed
into
it
an
error
without
ever
having
focused
on
the
relevant
materials
which
i
am
trying
to
present
to
the
court
now.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
have
suspected
that,
nevertheless,
in
one
of
the
places
where
you
mr.
justice
have
referred
to
this
which
is
in
a
dissent
you
wrote
in
the
case
called
hicks
against
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
also
not
cited
in
my
brief
which
in
383
u.
s.
you
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
in
one
of
these
cases
where
you
have
written
an
opinion,
you
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
court
has
discretions
for
grant.
and
i
suggest
that
putting
it
on
discretion
is
in
effect
a
denial
of
the
fact
that
the
statutory
power
is
to
grant
rules
and
is
a
recognition
of
the
fact
that
this
is
not
done
pursuant
to
rule
and
is
something
which
i
think
perhaps
the
court
might
not
have
done
if
there
had
been
an
opportunity
for
full
briefing
and
argument.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh
mr.
justice,
it's
in
my
notes
here
and
i
--
it's
not
a
fix
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
coy.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
robinson
was
390
u.
s.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
with
an
extension
of
60
days.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
what
you
have
is
a
statute
authorizing
the
court
to
prescribe
by
rule,
the
time
and
i
am
suggesting
that
the
practice
which
has
grown
up
of
doing
this
on
an
open
ended
basis
does
not
comply
with
the
statutorily
authorization
to
prescribe
by
rule.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh
yes
mr.
justice,
i
suspect
that
you
could
prescribe
two
years
if
you
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
thought
that
was
appropriate
i
don't
advocate
it
but
i
would
think
that
would
come
within
the
terms
of
the
statutory
authorization.
i
would
not
think
you
could
properly
say
maybe
filed
at
any
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
think
that
is
prescribing
by
rules.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
stern
and
greshem
missed
them,
a
great
many
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
in
which
you
granted
review.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh
no,
there'd
been
many
more
cases
on
that
in
which
the
applications
have
been
filed
late.
i'm
more
referring
to
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
somewhere
between
12
and
20
would
be
my
estimate
of
what
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
where
you
have
granted
it
and
proceeded
to
hear
the
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice,
my
position
is
thought
the
court
has
the
power
to
change
the
rule
which
it
doesn't
have
power
to
change
the
statute
that
is
the
rule
making
power
is
a
continuing
power.
that
once
the
court
has
adopted
a
rule
that
is
a
piece
of
delegated
legislation,
that
is
made
pursuant
to
the
authority
granted
by
congress
and
what
is
now
found
in
18
u.
s
c.
3772.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
this
case
it
is
unilateral.
in
the
case
of
proceeding
after
verdict,
congress
has
given
to
the
court
power
to
prescribe
by
rule
the
times
for
filing
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
my
position.
i
think
that
that
was
what
was
contemplated
by
congress.
i
think
that's
what
the
words
prescribe
by
rule
mean.
that
was
clearly
the
understanding
of
the
informed
commentators
at
the
time.
professor
orfield,
for
example,
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
rule
is
jurisdictional
and
that
was
the
almost
contemporaneous
decision
of
this
court
in
the
coy
case.
now,
i
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
language
has
changed
to
may,
it
also
changed
to
may
with
respect
to
appeals
and
this
court
in
the
robinson
case
in
361
u.
s.,
it
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
involved
a
late
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal.
and
the
court
held
that
the
may
language
there
was
compulsory
that
the
appeal
with
the
appellant
court
got
not
jurisdiction
when
the
appeal
was
filed
more
than
five
days
late
and
it
quoted
with
approval
the
language
from
united
states
against
smith,
the
phrase
of
--
lingers
on
indefinitely.
and
in
concluding
its
opinion,
it
said
something
further
which
seems
to
me
to
be
relevant
here.
that
powerful
policy
argument
maybe
made
both
for
and
against
greater
flexibility
with
respect
to
the
time
for
taking
of
an
appeal
is
indeed
evident.
but
that
policy
question
involving
as
it
does
many
witty
and
conflicting
consideration
must
be
resolved
through
the
rule
making
process
and
not
by
judicial
decision.
if
by
that
process
the
courts
are
ever
given
power
to
extend
the
time
for
the
filing
on
a
notice
of
appeal
upon
a
finding
of
excusable
neglect,
it
seems
reasonable
to
think
that
some
definite
limitation
upon
the
time
within
which
they
may
do
so
would
be
prescribed.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
case
is
tolerably
clear.
the
purpose
of
the
rules
was
to
cut
down
delays
to
restrict
the
time.
congress
was
not
clear
just
how
much
would
be
workable
and
delegated
the
authority
to
cut
down
the
time
to
the
court.
and
then
there's
the
language
of
the
statutory
authorization
or
to
prescribe
by
rule.
and
then
there's
the
language
of
the
rules
themselves.
the
rules
provide
that
the
petition
should
be
filed
within
30
days,
they
provide
further
that
a
justice
may
extend
the
time
within
30
days.
and
then
there
is
a
very
interesting
further
provision
in
the
rules
of
the
court.
rule
34
says
that
whenever
any
justice
of
this
court
is
empowered
by
law
to
extend
the
time,
an
application
seeking
such
extension
must
be
presented
to
the
court
within
the
period
sought
to
be
extended.
and
there
its
must
not
may,
it
is
specific.
and
finally,
there
was
the
decision
of
this
court.
in
the
coy
case
in
316
u.
s.
and
in
the
smith
and
robinson
cases.
well
now,
what
happened
to
upset
this
clear
picture?
nothing
deliberate,
i
may
point
out
that
in
the
coy
case
in
the
order
granting
certiorari,
the
court
expressly
directed
the
attention
of
council
to
the
question
of
the
time
limit
involved
and
asked
that
that
question
be
briefed
and
it
was.
but
at
no
time
has
the
court
ever
had
briefing
an
argument
in
these
cases
in
which
certiorari
has
been
granted
after
the
time
that
this
is
filed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice,
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
it's
the
rule
11
of
the
1934
rules.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
read
exactly
the
same
except
for
the
change
of
shall
to
may
to
which
i
have
already
referred
and
to
the
fact
that
at
the
time
coy
was
decided,
there
was
no
part
to
extend
the
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that's
essentially
the
language
of
the
1925
act
with
respect
to
civil
cases
which
they
were
simply
carrying
forward.
now,
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh
yes
mr.
justice,
i
recognized
the
one
day
argument
is
a
hard
one
and
if
it's
too
hard
for
the
court
to
accept
i
will
fall
back
and
say
“well,
at
least
you
got
to
have
sometime
limit
on
it”
and
the
only
feasible
one
is
the
old
90
day
statutory
one
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--not
the
rules
which
were
designed
to
expedite
criminal
appeals.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
logically
i
stand
by
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
black
but
the
rules
are
jurisdictional.
they
now
provide
for
30
days,
plus
as
an
extension
of
30
days
if
by
the
expressed
terms
of
the
rules,
the
application
is
made
within
the
30
days.
and
if
that
is
the
ground
upon
which
i
stand,
if
the
court
won't
accept
that
ground.
i
do
say
that
certainly
they
should
not
be
construed
to
leave
a
completely
open
ended.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
beyond
and
if
it
isn't
completely
open
ended,
where
should
it
stop.
well,
it
seems
to
me
at
the
place
where
it
was
before
the
rules
came
in
to
the
picture
in
which
to
be
technical
was
three
months
rather
than
90
days
at
that
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
at
least
is
within
the
--
it
is
within
the
language
of
--
to
prescribe
by
rule
and
you
would
have
to
read
into
that
while
congress
couldn't
have
intended
that
the
court
would
enlarge
the
time
or
that
congress
was
meaning
was
that
the
court
should
shorten
the
time
and
that's
another
case
which
we
don't
have
here
and
my
guess
is
the
court
isn't
going
to
prescribe
a
rule
which
fixes
it
in
two
years.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
argue
in
an
advisory
committee
working
to
assist
this
court
in
the
rule
making
process
that
the
court
could
not
appropriately
make
a
rule
of
more
than
90
days.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
enables
the
court
to
expedite
the
decisions
in
criminal
cases.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
this
court
has
so
recognized.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
when
it
was
only
a
day
or
two
here
and
there
i
was
just
puzzled
but
i
didn't
think
it's
was
appropriate
to
report
to
congress
that
the
court
was
violating
its
rules.
when
this
case
came
along
we
as
i
say
dug
into
it
and
found
quite
a
lot.
the
court
fell
into
this
error
if
my
may
put
it
that
way
in
heflin
against
the
united
states
in
358
u.
s.
further
question
came
up
only
in
the
most
back
handed
way.
it
was
not
dealt
within
the
briefs
of
any
of
the
parties
and
it
is
dealt
within
a
footnote
in
the
courts
opinion
of
the
complete
text
of
which
is,
the
complete
text
of
which
is
“well
because
no
jurisdictional
statute
is
involved”
that's
all.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
mr.
justice,
if
so
i
apologize
for
the
time
of
the
court
i
had
taken
that
seems
to
me
that
if
that
was
the
over
ruling
of
the
coy
case,
that
the
coy
case,
the
coy
case
was
entitled
to
be
present
at
its
own
funeral.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
court
--
had
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
court
was
aware
of
the
coy
case
at
that
time
or
that
it
would
have
dealt
with
it
in
such
a
completely
summary
fashion.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
mr.
justice,
yes
there
were.
it's
terribly
hard
to
tell
just
what
had
happened
in
the
coy
case.
it's
a
very
intricate
decision
arising
in
criminal
procedure
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
decided
that
the
--
what
the
district
court
had
done
was
wrong
but
the
consequence
of
that
was
to
make
it
a
criminal
appeal
and
since
it
was
a
criminal
appeal,
it
was
too
late
because
it
was
filed
more
than
--
the
petitioner
filed
more
than
30
days
and
then
the
court
said
in
the
footnote
“but
a
majority
of
the
court
feels
that
in
order
to
avoid
security
because
it
was
pointed
out
that
they
could
go
back
in
the
district
court
and
start
over
again
and
raise
the
same
question
and
since
the
point
is
not
jurisdictional
that
they
would
hear
the
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
mr.
justice,
my
argument
would
extend
to
that.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
at
least
in
civil
cases
that
is
completely
unjustifiable
and
i
can
find
no
reason
why
it
isn't
equally
unjustifiable
in
terms
of
this
court's
own
rules.
and
now,
with
respect
to
all
of
these
things,
if
the
rules
so
construed
are
too
inflexible,
then
i
submit
that
the
change
should
come
through
the
rule
making
process
and
not
in
essence
by
an
acquiescence.
and
if
there
is
a
change
made
through
the
rule
making
process,
it
will
almost
certainly
have
an
eventual
time
limit
and
also
some
statement
of
the
grounds
or
considerations
on
which
such
an
extension
will
be
granted.
in
some
instances,
which
leaves
this
important
matter
wholly
at
large,
not
even
good
cause
shown
or
excuse
them
on
neglect
as
things
now
stand,
cannot
with
true
propriety
be
called
a
rule
and
it
is
only
the
power
to
prescribe
rules
which
congress
has
given
to
the
court
in
this
area.
incidentally
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
now
come,
it
was
the
taglianetti
case
in
394
u.s,
this
not
one
of
your
dissents,
where
again
in
a
footnote
and
wholly
conclusary,
the
court
said
the
time
limit
is
not
jurisdictional
citing
heflin
and
does
not
bar
our
exercise
of
discretion
to
consider
the
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
taglianetti,
its
394
u.s.
316
and
that
is
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
was
the
rules
of
practice
in
criminal
cases
before
verdict.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
which
included
because
of
a
special
provision
in
the
statute,
the
authority
of
the
court
to
prescribe
rules
fixing
the
time
for
taking
appeals
and
for
filing
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
rule
11
was
not.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
whole
set
of
rules
is
made
under
authority
of
the
--
granted
by
the
congress
to
the
court
to
make
rules
its
own
and
that
was
not
placed
before
a
congress
and
that
has
been
true
all
the
way
along.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
for
a
while
it
was
in
both
places.
it
was
in
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
by
way
of
a
cross
reference.
it
was
in
rule
37
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
until
1967
or
1968
when
the
court
abrogated
rule
37,
and
since
that
time
it
has
been
exclusively
in
the
rules
of
this
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
by
way
of
a
cross
reference
mr.
justice,
rule
37
(2).
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
those
three
captors
of
those
rules
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
were
not
laid
before
the
congress.
there
was
a
complicated
submission
by
which
all
of
the
rules
except
these
three
chapters
were
laid
before
congress
but
these
three
chapters
relating
to
appeals
were
prescribed
by
the
court
effective
on
the
same
day
as
the
rules
laid
before
congress
became
effective.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice
i
apologize
for
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
was
quite
wrong.
it
was
the
hicks
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
was
the
one
in
which
you
referred
to
heflin
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
and
said
that
it
was
not
jurisdictional.
taglianetti
was
a
per
curiam
and
i
wouldn't
know
who
wrote
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
that
only
applies
to
rules
which
are
made
by
the
court
acting
pursuant
to
a
grant
of
authority
given
by
a
congress
to
act
in
essentially
a
legislative
manner.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
be
restricted
to
any
rules
made
pursuant
to
the
power
originally
granted
in
1933-34
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
and
now
granted
by
title
18
u.s.
code
section
3772.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
mr.
justice
i
don't
think
so.
although
insofar
as
it
does
deal
with
rules
which
have
been
laid
before
a
congress
which
includes
the
whole
business
of
rules
of
civil
procedure.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
would
only
be
with
respect
to
those
rules
of
this
court
which
i
made
pursuant
to
a
grant
of
power
by
congress.
and
i
would
not
suggest
that
it
would
be
claimed
that
this
court
had
power
to
fix
the
time
for
filing
petition
for
certiorari
or
to
take
appeals
simply
out
of
its
inherent
power.
but
that
that
part
has
never
been
thought
to
come
to
the
court
except
pursuant
to
the
grant
which
congress
has
made.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
a
grant
of
delegated
legislation.
it's
a
nice
problem
in
separation
of
powers
but
is
one
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i've
got
over
being
puzzled
by
that
one.
i
used
to
be
puzzled
somewhat
but
i
can
accept
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh,
yes
mr.
justice.
i
would
assume
that
it
was.
this
is
a
part
of
the
power
of
congress
to
make
law
as
long
since
established
that
congress
can
do
that
in
certain
cases
and
under
proper
conditions
by
delegating
it
to
other
governmental
bodies
and
is
most
appropriate
that
this
particular
item
should
be
delegated
to
this
court.
but
what
this
court
does
pursuant
to
that
power
is
essentially
legislative
and
our
submission
is
that
it
should
be
so
treated
and
perhaps
most
important
of
all
that
this
court
so
decided
in
the
coy
case
and
has
never
since
decided
to
the
contrary
with
any
indication
of
treatment
of
the
issues
in
the
problem
or
of
the
continuing
validity
of
the
coy
case
itself.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
in
this
case,
the
regulation
of
the
congress
has
made
has
been
to
delegate
this
to
the
court
but
i
suggest
that
the
congress
never
contemplated
that
that
was
a
simply
open
ended
delegation
whenever
the
court
thinks
in
its
a
good
discretion
that
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
take
the
case
than
it
shall
which
is
near
as
i
can
see
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh,
i
don't
know
mr.
justice.
it
depends
on
how
you
define
restrictive.
i
can
define
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
not.
i
think
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
even
strict
construction
is
i
think
believe
in
a
certain
measure
of
flexibility
and
that
flexibility
is
one
which
we
not
only
have
been
able
to
live
with
but
which
we
have
come
to
accept.
we
find
it
more
frequently
of
course
in
delegations
to
administrative
bodies,
but
in
this
area
it's
most
appropriate
that
there
be
a
delegation
to
the
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
didn't
start
the
merits
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
know
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
seems
to
me
that
and
what
has
been
done
in
this
case,
the
court
can
if
in
its
discretion
whatever
that
means,
it
think
it
appropriate,
it
can
grant
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
any
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
made
at
anytime
in
the
past
which
isn't
moot
for
some
reasons
or
other.
and
that
i
don't
think
was
contemplated
by
congress
and
yet
i
think
that's
what's
involved
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
that
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
and
i
don't
really
know
much
about
that--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
remember
what
the
time
limit
would
be.
there
are
bills
of
review
which
people
found
when
there
had
been
corruption
in
the
courts
and
they
upset
judgments
long
after
the
event,
and
in
equity,
you
can
do
a
lot
of
remarkable
things.
professor
chafe,
he
taught
me
that
long
ago
but
i
don't
--
this
particular
writ
of
certiorari
is
a
pretty
--
pretty
technical
term
of
art
which
i
don't
think
comes
within
those
others.
well
now,
with
respect
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
the
first
is
the
constitutional
validity
of
title
18
section
702
and
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
how
there
can
be
any
doubt
about
this.
this
is
the
provision
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
for
an
unauthorized
person
to
wear
the
uniform
or
any
distinctive
part
there
of
it.
incidentally,
let
me
clear
up
one
possible
misconception
which
came
from
the
petitioner's
argument.
he
suggested
that
there
might
be
a
simulation
of
the
uniform
here
but
actually
the
indictment
is
simply
that
he
did
wear
a
distinctive
part
of
the
official
uniform
and
the
trial
was
conducted
throughout
on
the
basis
that
he
wore
a
distinctive
part
of
the
uniform.
there
is
no
basis
for
saying
that
it
was
something
which
simulated
the
uniform.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
now
in
that
connection,
i
would
call
attention
to
page
45
and
46
of
the
appendix
where
an
exhibit
12
was
introduced
in
the
trial,
read
to
the
jury,
official
army
regulation
and
on
page
46
about
two
inches
down
in
quotation
marks,
the
following
uniforms
and
articles
thereof
for
a
male
members
of
the
united
states
army
are
distinct.
distinctive
components
of
the
uniforms
are
limited
to
caps,
coats,
jackets
and
trousers
except
as
indicated.
so
that
the
socks
and
the
handkerchiefs
are
out,
even
shoes
are
out.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
this
is
the
quotation
from
exhibit
12.
exhibit
12
is
the
regulation
and
this
is
a
quotation
from
exhibit
12.
i
don't
have
exhibit
12
in
my
hand
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
indeed
i
haven't
examined
it.
i
believe
this
to
be
a
quotation
from
exhibit
12
which
it
purports
to
be.
i
would
also
point
out
that
further
down
on
the
page
that
buttons
are
referred
to
and
i
would
also
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
on
page
13
an
fbi
agent
testified
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
page
13
of
the
appendix.
in
response
to
the
question,
would
you
just
describe
the
jacket
he
had
on
when
you
saw
him?
a
green
jacket
with
a
brass
buttons
of
the
type
issued
associated
with
military
uniforms
and
you
note
that
jackets
are
one
of
the
things
that
are
a
distinctive
part.
and
then
on
page
20,
a
us
army
colonel
at
page,
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
on
his
head
he
had
the
fur
filled
army
officer's
cap
with
the
loose
strap
--
with
the
strap
loose
and
hanging
down
and
with
an
army
officer's
insignia
upside
down.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
i
believe
by
some
stretch
of
the
imagination
mr.
justice
is
a
theatrical
production.
we
will
argue
here
later
that
it
is
not
--
that
this
was
not
that
--
of
course
is
given
under
circumstances
and
in
a
situation
where
everyone
present
knows
that
it
is
simulated.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
given
in
washington,
which
is
close
to
the
pentagon
and
where
other
things
have
happened.
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
that
is
a
simulation
and
here
there
was
a
considerable
reason
to
doubt
whether
the
person
involved
was
or
was
not
a
member
of
the
armed
forces.
now,
the
petitioner
here,
perhaps
his
oral
argument
belies
this
but
as
i
read
his
brief,
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
made
no
claim
that
he
didn't
come
within
the
terms
of
the
statute
that
is
that
he
was
wearing
a
distinctive
part
of
the
uniform.
it
seems
to
me
to
leave
no
question
which
was
not
in
substance
coved
by
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
against
o'brien,
the
case
involving
the
burning
of
the
draft
card.
surely,
there
is
power
in
congress
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
uniform
of
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
this
is
a
matter,
which
is
of
importance
not
only
to
the
army
but
also
to
citizens.
we
have
to
be
able
to
rely
on
the
fact
when
we
see
a
policeman
that
he
is
a
policeman.
and
these
times,
we
have
to
be
able
to
rely
on
the
fact
when
we
see
a
man
in
military
uniform
that
he
is
a
member
of
the
military.
the
constitution
expressly
gives
to
congress
the
power
to
raise
and
maintain
armies
and
to
do
all
things
necessary
and
proper
to
carry
that
power
into
effect.
and
surely
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
mr.
justice,
you
will
almost
always
find
that
the
buttons
have
been
removed.
that
seems
to
be
the
convention
in
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
if
i
can
get
to
that
case
soon
enough,
maybe
i
could
exercise
some
prosecutorial
discretion
with
respect
to
that
case.
this
--
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
situation
where
discretion
might
be
appropriate.
in
this
case,
where
the
prosecutor
exercises
the
discretion
otherwise
and
where
two
courts
below
have
sustained
that,
i
found
no
effective
way
that
i
could
proceed
except
by
defending
the
actions
which
they
have
taken.
this
court
in
united
states
against
bernal,
which
involved
a
prosecution
for
impersonating
an
officer,
a
cognate
question
said
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
such
statute
is
to
maintain
the
general
good
repute
and
dignity
of
the
service
itself.
and
this
is
essentially
an
argument,
which
i
made
somewhat
against
the
advise
of
some
of
my
associates
in
the
o'brien
case,
where
i
contended
that
it
was
within
the
power
of
congress
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
in
connection
with
the
power
given
to
raise
and
defend
armies,
to
protect
the
dignity
of
the
selective
service
process
by
making
it
a
crime
to
burn
draft
cards.
i
did
that
because
i
found
it
somewhat
difficult
myself
to
find
that
draft
cards
themselves
were
of
very
great
importance
in
the
process.
the
court
took
the
latter
ground
in
its
opinion
and
thus
the
o'brien
case
is
not
a
decision
on
that
point
but
i
think
that
the
decision
reads
is
very
close
to
the
one
which
is
involved
here.
so
our
position
would
be
that
the
criminal
code
provision
is
constitutional
and
that
the
defendant
clearly
came
within
it
and
was
properly
found
by
the
jury
to
have
come
within
it.
and
so
we
come
to
the
exemption
in
10
u.
s.
code
772
(f)
and
our
contention
is
that
the
petitioner
was
not
by
any
reasonable
stretch
of
the
interpretation
of
the
words
in
that
statute
an
actor
in
a
theatrical
or
motion
picture
production.
now
obviously,
it
wasn't
motion
picture
so
you
can
throw
that
out.
so
you
have
to
make
him
an
actor
in
a
theatrical
production.
now
originally,
this
statute
we
spelled
out
the
history
of
such
as
it
is
in
our
brief.
the
statute
prohibited
any
person
from
wearing
the
uniform
in
any
playhouse
or
theater
or
in
moving
picture
films.
and
it
was
codified
i
think
in
1954
and
the
sponsors
emphasized
that
no
substantive
change
was
intended.
the
objective
was
to
make
it
plain
that
television
performances
would
be
covered,
which
might
not
come
within
playhouse
or
theatre.
but
the
intention
of
congress
is
manifested
in
the
original
language
and
in
the
revision
and
that
is
that
it
is
confined
to
situations
where
the
make
believe
role
of
the
person
wearing
the
uniform
is
clear
from
the
setting.
thus,
it
seems
to
me
that
dr.
strangelove
or
the
(inaudible)
mutiny
come
within
it
because
everybody
knows
that's
a
simulation.
it
doesn't
mean
that
a
performance
must
be
given
in
the
building,
could
be
an
outdoor
theatre,
could
be
an
area
set
aside
for
it.
it
means
only
that
the
performance
wherever
given
must
preserve
some
of
the
traditional
characteristics
of
dramatic
presentation
such
as
the
defined
area
set
apart
for
the
actors
and
an
audience
surprised
that
the
events
which
they
observed
are
portrayed
and
not
real.
the
skit
here
was
not
a
theatrical
production
in
any
reasonable
meaning
of
that
term.
it
was
an
intermittent
event
in
a
demonstration
in
the
street,
in
front
of
an
induction
station
that
also
included
picketing
and
distributing
leaflets.
pedestrians
and
motorists
who
either
stopped
or
passed
by
the
demonstrating
could
reasonably
believe
that
the
petitioner
was
in
fact
a
soldier
as
his
wearing
of
distinctive
parts
of
the
uniform
was
intended
to
convey.
the
petitioner's
conduct
here
has
all
the
elements
of
picketing
and
no
real
similarity
to
the
theatrical
production
which
congress
contemplated,
and
no
one
would
suggest
i
believe
that
a
person
would
be
entitled
without
authority
to
wear
the
uniform
of
the
army
merely
because
he
was
picketing.
to
seek
to
bring
the
petitioner's
action
here
within
the
statutory
language
is
pressing
that
language
to
it's
dryly
logical
extreme
or
to
use
of
another
passage
from
homes
of
being
led
by
technical
definition
to
apply
a
certain
name
and
then
to
deduce
consequences
which
have
no
relation
to
the
grounds
on
which
the
name
was
applied.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
and
because
of
that,
we
--
since
we
think
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
what
he
did
does
not
come
within
the
exemption
in
the
statute.
but
the
qualification
on
that
exemption
about
tending
to
discredit
the
armed
forces
is
irrelevant.
this
is
a
little
like
for
example,
the
lopez
case
which
involved
the
defense
of
entrapment
and
the
contention
was
made
that
the
charge
about
entrapment
was
not
quite
right
and
the
court
held
where
it
wasn't
necessary
to
decide
that
because
as
a
matter
of
law,
there
wasn't
any
entrapment
and
he
wasn't
entitled
to
any
charge
with
respect
to
entrapment.
and
we
would
contend
here
that
the
defendant
was
not
entitled
to
any
charge
with
respect
to
the
defense
of
actor
in
a
theatrical
production
and
therefore
the
question
of
discredit
becomes
irrelevant.
i
would
be
prepared
myself
to
defend
a
discredit
exception
to
the
exception
to
the
statute
if
it
was
necessary
although
i
agree
that
it's
getting
very
close
to
the
line
but
on
grounds
similar
to
those
which
were
involved
in
the
o'brien
case
with
respect
to
the
draft
cards.
an
analogy
is
the
copyright
law.
after
all
the
uniform
is
the
uniform
of
the
united
states
and
the
united
states
is
entitled
to
have
some
control
over
the
way
in
which
it
is
used.
but
as
i
have
contended,
the
petitioner
doesn't
come
within
the
exception
in
any
of
the
exemption
in
any
event.
all
that's
happened
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
here
was
that
the
petitioner
received
the
benefit
of
the
defense
to
which
he
was
not
entitled.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh,
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
it
was
part
of
the
demonstration.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
and
had
he
simply
stood
outside
and
made
a
speech
against
the
war
in
vietnam
wearing
the
uniform,
i
cannot
see
any
basis
upon
which
the
fact
that
he
was
making
a
speech
would
entitle
him
to
exemption
from
the
statute,
which
makes
it
a
defense
to
wear
the
uniform
of
the
united
states
without
authority.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
court
said,
this
is
page
337
of
the
transcript,
was
the
portrayal
without
reference
to
the
fact
you
had
on
full
uniform
calculated
to
discredit
the
army
or
the
armed
forces.
the
witness,
i
think
the
uniform
showed
disapproval
and
my
intentions
were
to
show
my
disapproval
of
the
actions
of
the
army.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
there's
some
evidence
that
they
rehearsed
this
skit,
if
you
can
call
it
a
skit.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i
think
it's
reaching
quite
a
bit
to
call
it
even
a
skit
which
isn't
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
don't
think
so
and
they
could
have
worn
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
could
have
worn
other
types
of
uniforms.
you
can
get
uniforms
other
than
the
uniform
of
the
united
states
army
from
theatrical
supply
houses
if
there
had
been
some
theatrics
here
they
might
have
done
something.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
i
think
not.
i
think
to
be
a
theatrical
performance
you
have
to
have
something
like
a
stage.
i
don't
mean
indoors,
i
don't
mean
formal
but
you
have
to
have
some
place
where
there
are
players
and
some
place
where
there
is
an
audience.
and
this
was
in
essence
a
demonstration
not
a
theatrical
performance.
our
position
would
be
that
as
a
matter
of
law
this
was
not
a
theatrical
performance.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh,
yes,
yes.
where
you
--
what
we
have
put
in
to
our
brief
essentially
is
a
separate
place
for
the
players
and
circumstances
under
which
it
is
evident
that
it
is
a
simulation
and
not
actual
effect.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
but
whether
the
person
was
or
was
not
a
member
of
the
armed
forces.
was
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
was
the
important
part
of
it
and
there
was
nothing
here
to
indicate
that
he
was
not
a
member
of
the
armed
forces.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
there
was
some
kind
of
an
indication
that
it
was
a
play.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
have
helped
in
this
case
but
indeed,
if
he
had
had
a
sign
of
in
his
back
not
a
member
of
the
army,
that
might
have
made
it
enough
so
that
the
jacket
was
not
a
distinctive
part
of
the
uniform,
i
don't
know,
we're
very
close
to
the
line
in
each
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
of
course
that's
part
of
the
problem.
the
government
tries
to
protect
itself
in
various
ways
and
then
whatever
you
do
is
either
speech
or
a
symbolic
speech
and
the
first
amendment
completely
engulfs
it
and
the
government's
powers
are
sharply
restricted.
now
obviously,
there
is
a
line,
a
very
important
line
and
a
difficult
line
but
it's
perfectly
plain.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
protest
could
be
made
and
could
be
made
without
interference
at
that
place,
at
that
time,
the
problem
was
the
making
it
in
the
way
in
which
it
was
made
regardless
of
the
place
and
the
time,
including
the
wearing
of
the
uniform
which
congress
for
more
than
50
years
has
made
it
an
offense
when
not
authorized.
well,
our
first
submission
is
that
the
court
should
dismiss
this
petition
as
having
been
granted
without
jurisdiction.
if
we
are
not
successful
on
that
and
i
hope
that
we
will
be
because
i'm
greatly
troubled
by
the
un-open
ended
situation
in
which
we
now
are
that
the
decision
below
on
the
merit
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
no
sir.
