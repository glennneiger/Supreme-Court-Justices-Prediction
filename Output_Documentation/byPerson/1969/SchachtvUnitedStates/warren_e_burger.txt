chief

e.
burger
we'll
hear
628,
schacht
against
the
united
states.
mr.
berg,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
he
served
his
present
sentence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
hasn't
served
any
part
of
it,
this
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
notice
counsel
that
you
describe
this
in
your
factual
statement
as
a
demonstration
in
front
of
the
recruiting
headquarters
or
some
such
thing.
you
do
not
make
a
claim
that
this
is
a
theatrical
production?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
--
then
you're
describing
this
is
a
demonstration,
was
not
intended
to
preclude
your
claim
in
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
your
brief
that
i
wondered
if
you
were
changing
your
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
after
this,
you
had
a
general
verdict
and
you
can't
of
identify
the
jury
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yeah,
well,
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
should
we
draw
from
that,
that
the
government
has
been
negligent
in
enforcing
this
statute
or
just
what's
your
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
should
the
court
do
about
that
when
it
gets
a
case
where
they
are
interested
in
enforcing
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
your
point
for
a
moment
to
--
about
the
compelling
interest,
i
don't
recall
many
events
on
but
i
don't
recall
in
the
last
14
years
any
frequency
of
prosecutions
for
impersonating
a
federal
agent.
would
you
draw
from
that
that
the
federal
government
has
lost
its
interest
in
prosecuting
people
from
--
for
impersonating
federal
agents
or
perhaps
would
another
reasonable
inference
be
that
not
very
many
people
have
been
doing
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
evidence
you
have
in
this
record
of
widespread
use?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
the
military
insignia
and
buttons
on
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
removed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
are
they
removed
before
the
sale?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words
the
essence
of
it
is
that
was
negligence
of
counsel
is
that
what
you're
suggesting?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
this
rule
mr.
solicitor
general,
once
adopted,
is
it
your
position
that
has
the
same
course
as
the
statute
in
the
civil
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
now,
are
you
speaking
of
a
rule
making
power
where
it's
unilateral
or
where
it's
concurrence
with
commerce?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
me
ask
you
this
to
pursue
justice
stewart's
questions.
you
said
you
were
somewhat
puzzled
by
this
possible
conflict
between
the
branches
but
if
it
arises
out
of
article
three
which
gives
congress
the
power
to
define
the
jurisdiction
i
believe
and
would
not
the
power
to
define
jurisdiction
include
all
the
incidental
power
to
define
how
it's
to
be
executed?
how
jurisdiction
is
to
be
implemented
including
fixing
the
number
of
days
within
which
filing
must
be
happening.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
your
earlier
statements.
if
we
have
power
to
waive
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i'm
not
getting
on
the
merits
yet.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
still
on
jurisdiction.
your
earlier
statement
on
the
question
of
time,
if
we
can
casually
waive
the
late
filing
of
a
week,
we
can
do
it,
you
said
for
two
years?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
we
have
common
law
writs
of
certiorari
under
the
--
perhaps
under
the
all
writs
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
don't
even
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
we
have
sought
a
great
deal
of
your
time
with
jurisdictional
problem.
we
will
extend
your
argument
10
minutes
over
the
four
remaining
and
accordingly
accommodate
your
friend
if
he
needs
the
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
not
his
own
statement
suggest
part
of
the
answer
to
that?
that
the
petitioner's
own
statement
was
that
he
was
doing
it
to
express
his
views
on
the
war
in
vietnam?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
berg.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
did
not
understand
the
solicitor
general
to
concede
that
the
wearing
of
this
apparel
was
symbolic
speech.
he
said
that
each
time
these
problems
are
raised
in
the
courts,
he
has
met
with
the
argument
that
this
is
symbolic
speech.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
wouldn't
treat
that
as
a
concession.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
his
intention
is
not
in
dispute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
for
your
submission
mr.
berg
and
mr.
solicitor
