justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
solicitor,
i
have
great
trouble
with
the
usual
statement
which
is
usually
taken
for
granted
that
a
court
can
usually
ask
discretion
to
waive
its
rules
but
never
to
raise
--
to
waive
a
statute.
and
in
this
case
you
say
that
we
cannot
waive
the
statute,
civil.
and
so
now
we
can't
waive
a
rule.
well,
that
does
not
apply
to
all
of
the
rules,
just
this
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
is
restricted
to
this
one
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
see
the
problem
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
don't
know
whether
it
apply
to
any
other
rule?
you
see
my
problem,
you
say
we've
been
violating
the
law,
i'm
wondering
we
might
be
violating
the
law
or
some
of
the
rules?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
i'm
talking
about
the
rules
of
this
court
where
you
just
read
from?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
solicitor
general,
on
disgrace
to
the
army,
does
that
apply
to
the
dozens
of
(inaudible)
bungs
we
used
to
see
everyday
with
army
jackets
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
have
seen
plenty
with
buttons
on.
i've
seen
them
with
jackets
and
overcoats
and
the
fur
hat.
