justice

he
what?
justice

black
what
kind
of
blouse?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
show
why
this
delay
occurred?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
all
right,
it's
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
solicitor
general
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
you
are
saying
in
this
case
which
is
129
days
overtime
that
is
jurisdictional
--
i
supposed
it
had
been
one
day
over
the
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
government
with
you
mr.
solicitor
general,
look
at
the
cases
to
see
how
many
times
this
court
had
accepted
jurisdiction
when
it
was
over
the
time
limit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
that
was
thought
to
be
enough.
maybe
it
was
thought
that
it
didn't
deserve
anymore
length
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
name
of
that
case
you
saying?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
grant
of
legislative
power?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
solicitor
general,
as
scripted
in
the
vocabulary,
recent
with
the
idea
of
a
restrictive
interpretation
of
the
constitution.
do
you
think
that
is
a
restrictive
interpretation
of
a
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
page
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
other
evidence
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
why
he
wore
the
uniform?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
he
say
as
to
why
he
was
doing
it,
in
the
record?
do
you
remember?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
act
is
a
kind
of
a
theatrical
performance
even
though
they
called
it
a
protest,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
is
a
strong.
wasn't
it?
that
would
be
a
pretty
stronghold
against
the
law,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
think?
is
the
play
a
negative
theatrical
performance?
the
jitney
players
i
suppose
would
come
here,
have
you
ever
seen
the
jitney
players?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
wouldn't
have
to
make
statement
that
i
am
not
a
member
of
the
armed
forces,
would
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
they
call
it
a
protest,
we're
really
getting
to
pretty
close
lines,
don't
we?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
resting
wholly
on
that
constitutional
claim,
are
you?
justice
hugo
