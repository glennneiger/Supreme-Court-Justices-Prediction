mr.
david
h.
berg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner's
case
arises
out
of
his
conviction
under
title
18,
united
states
code
702,
which
prohibits
impertinent
part
being
authorized
to
wearing
of
distinctive
parts
of
arm
forces
uniform
are
parts
similar
to
distinctive
parts
of
the
armed
forces
uniform.
the
appendix
to
our
brief
sets
out
the
statutes
in
total.
the
conduct
that
the
defendant
at
the
trial
below
engaged
in
was
his
taking
part
in
a
vietnamese
protest.
the
protest
took
place
in
front
of
the
army
induction
center
in
houston
texas
on
december
4,
1967.
the
petitioner
was
wearing
as
part
of
the
protest,
parts
of
a
military
uniform.
his
part
in
the
protest
was
to
discord
a
water
gun
filled
with
red
ink
at
someone
dressed
as
a
viet
cong.
the
viet
cong
would
fall.
he
would
run,
shouting
“be
an
able
american”
to
the
fallen
viet
cong
and
say
“my
god,
this
is
a
pregnant
woman.”
after
his
performance
a
few
hours
later,
he
was
arrested
tried,
convicted
on
the
charge
that
i've
set
out
before.
his
sentence
was
six
months
to
be
served
and
a
$250.00
fine.
the
case
was
appealed
to
the
fifth
circuit
of
appeals
which
affirmed
the
conviction
and
the
supreme
court
granted
cert
on
december
15,
1969.
mr.
david
h.
berg
no
sir,
he
has
not.
mr.
david
h.
berg
well,
in
avertedly,
he
did.
the
petition
was
filed
out
of
time.
he
was
committed
for
three
weeks.
we
lodged
a
motion
for
leave
to
submit
out
of
time
which
was
granted.
he
was
released
from
prison.
it
is
our
contention
that
daniel
schacht
engaged
in
symbolic
speech
by
wearing
parts
of
a
military
uniform
during
the
skit.
we
feel
that
the
court's
first
inquiry
must
be
made
on
the
basis
of
the
holding
of
the
o'brien
decision
that
draft
card
burning
case.
that
case
held
if
we
understand
it
correctly
that
there
are
certain
areas
of
freedom
of
speech
which
the
government
may
impinge
upon
if
there's
a
clear
and
compelling
interest
of
the
government
to
be
protected
by
the
regulation
that
it
seeks
to
enforce.
it
is
our
contention
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
compelling
governmental
interest
in
regulating
the
wearing
of
distinctive
parts
or
parts
similar
to
distinctive
parts
of
an
armed
forces
uniform.
mr.
david
h.
berg
your
honor,
we
do
make
that
claim.
we
make
the
claim
that
he's
entitled
to
a
submission
on
the
question.
i
didn't
characterize
it
entirely.
it
was
a
skit
rehearsed
a
day
before.
mr.
david
h.
berg
no.
mr.
david
h.
berg
as
it
where
a
play
within
a
play,
within
a
demonstration.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
your
honor,
we
still
reach
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes.
--that
he
told
the
jury
that
if
they
file
it,
it
was
—within
the
statutory
exception,
they
should
acquit
him?
mr.
david
h.
berg
and
that
--
and
incidentally
that
charge
were
submitted
by
the
government's
attorney.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes,
we
did,
at
the
trial—
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
sir.
mr.
david
h.
berg
that's
correct.
mr.
david
h.
berg
because
the
statutory
scheme
graded
by
the
exception
itself
is
unconstitutional.
we
feel
that
the
government
--
by
that
i
mean
that
the
constitutional
scheme
is
one
which
punishes
one
--
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
sir.
mr.
david
h.
berg
well,
in
this
instance,
he
was
granted
the
--
he
was
given
a
submission
on
that
issue.
the
jury
nonetheless
found
him
guilty
and
we
say
that
the
entire
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
david
h.
berg
no
sir
that
we
can't
tell
from
the
case
either.
mr.
david
h.
berg
that's
correct,
under
the
holding
of
a
straight
case.
we
don't
know
why
this
man
was
convicted.
we
don't
know
whether
he
was
in
a
play
or
he
was
in
a
play
that
discredited
it?
mr.
david
h.
berg
someone
wearing
distinctive
parts
and
if
that
be
the
case
then
that
part
--
we
feel
that
part
of
the
exception
is
clearly
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
david
h.
berg
no
sir,
for
the
most
part--
mr.
david
h.
berg
if
there
is
no
issue
for
the
jury
on
the
basis
of
the
fact--
mr.
david
h.
berg
--
as
with
the
exception.
mr.
david
h.
berg
then
we
still
have
to
deal
with
whether
or
not
there's
a
compelling
interest.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
sir.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes.
we
feel
that
a
constitutional
decision
would--
mr.
david
h.
berg
your
honor,
if
the
facts
of
the
case
clearly
indicate
that
he
fell
within
the
exception,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
still
whether
or
not
that
exception
--
mr.
david
h.
berg
it
did
go
to
the
jury.
mr.
david
h.
berg
unless
i
misunderstand
sir,
it
did
go
to
the
jury?
mr.
david
h.
berg
under
the
holding
of
the
o'brien
decision,
it's
our
contention
whether
or
not
he's
entitled
to
an
instruction
on
the
statutory
--
the
exception
to
the
main
statute.
the
government
has
exhibited
no
compelling
interest
in
controlling
whether
or
not
one
may
wear
distinctive
parts
of
armed
forces
uniform
or
part
similar
to
distinctive
parts.
mr.
david
h.
berg
mr.
justice
stewart
i
would
concede
only
that
he
had
on
parts
of
a
military
uniform
but
not
characterize
it,
it
was
distinctive.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes,
yes
sir.
mr.
david
h.
berg
well,
one
of
the
questions
we
raised
sir
is
that
we
don't
know
what
word
distinctive
part
means
and
we
don't
know
whether
--
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
sir.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes.
mr.
david
h.
berg
it
doesn't
to
--
excuse
me
sir,
it
doesn't
really
matter
to
us
if
we
want
to
characterize
it
as
having
worn
a
distinctive
part,
our
point
we
feel
is
still
the
same.
that
the
--
mr.
david
h.
berg
well,
if
i
understand
the
question
correctly,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
fact
is
in
dispute
that
he
was
wearing
a
distinctive
part
of
the
uniform.
mr.
david
h.
berg
alright,
and
it's
our
contention
that
that's
one
of
the
problems
of
the
statute.
we
have
no
way
of
telling
sir
whether
or
not
he
was
wearing
a
distinctive
part.
if
he
wasn't
then
he's
not
guilty
to
begin
with.
if
he
was,
then
we
still
have
problems
with
the
statute.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes.
mr.
david
h.
berg
your
honor,
from
the
verdict
that
was
returned,
we
can
only
assume
that--
mr.
david
h.
berg
no.
but
we
don't
know
that
they
didn't
convict
him
on
these
grounds
that
he
was
wearing
a
similar
part,
a
part
similar
to
a
distinctive
part.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes.
that
at
least
that
the
jury
--
mr.
david
h.
berg
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
sir.
that
would
be
prerequisite
finding.
mr.
david
h.
berg
an
eagle
insignia
turned
upside
down.
mr.
david
h.
berg
an
eagle
insignia
turned
upside
down
on
an
obsolete
world
war
ii
hat.
a
blouse
and
some
bottoms
and
a
green
--
mr.
david
h.
berg
an
army
blouse.
mr.
david
h.
berg
buttons
on
the
blouse?
mr.
david
h.
berg
military
buttons
on
the
blouse
and
the
cap
he
uses
i
remember
were
not
military
issue
and
some
civilian
boots.
mr.
david
h.
berg
spread
eagle.
mr.
david
h.
berg
the
spread
eagle.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
sir.
the
government
would
seek
to
tell
us
to
justify
the
imposition
or
the
impingement
of
daniel
schachts.
first
amendment
rights,
the
right
to
where
this
parts
of
the
uniform
on
the
basis
that
government
has
some
sort
of
overwhelming
interest
in
regulating
this
wearing.
it's
our
contention
from
the
facts
of
the
trial
that
the
government
in
fact
sells
the
jobbers
all
over
the
nation,
the
parts
of
the
uniform
which
later
end
up
in
the
hands
of
the
people
who
wear
it.
this
court
might
take
note
of
the
fact
that
the
army
jacket
is
worn
by
many
people,
the
army
raincoat.
parts
that
look
similar,
two
parts
of
an
army
uniform
are
widespread
worn
by
young
people
especially
by
young
people.
and
if
the
interest
in
regulating
this
wearing
was
so
overwhelming,
then
it
would
appear
to
us
that
the
government
would
not
sell
on
a
wholesale
basis
to
jobbers
across
the
nation.
if
there
is
a
government
interest
in
the
distinctive
wearing,
they
simply
have
it
sought
to
it
to
assert
that
interest.
we
have
been
unable
to
find
very
many
cases
under
the
statutes
where
convictions
at
least
have
occurred
under
18702.
in
fact,
four
since
1940
and
i
believe
the
statute
in
one
form
or
another
has
been
in
the
book
since
1960.
of
course
--
mr.
david
h.
berg
our
point,
my
point
that
there's
some
evidence
the
government
is
not
interested
enforcing
the
statute.
mr.
david
h.
berg
in
this
particular
case,
we
feel
it's
evidence
of
the
government's
lack
of
a
compelling
interest
in
impinging
his
first
amendment,
in
regulating
the
wear
and
therefore
impinging
his
rights,
constitutional
rights.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
sir,
i
believe
that
there
is
a
statute.
mr.
david
h.
berg
about
the
impersonation,
is
there,
and
that
would
be
our
point
that
this
type
--
this
kind
of
protection
could
be
garnered
for
the
government
and
more
narrow
stand.
mr.
david
h.
berg
i
believe
that
there
is
a
penalty
for
personating
an
officer
that
applies
to
civilian
just
for
making
a
meal
ticket
of
the
uniform
one
way
or
another.
i
raise
briefly
the
question
of
the
vagueness
of
the
statute.
we
feel
that
if
the
court
should
find
that
there
is
some
compelling
interest
in
regulating
the
wearing
of
the
distinctive
parts
of
the
uniform,
that
there
is
still
a
question
under
the
statute,
18702
as
to
what
authority
--
authorized
means
under
the
statute
to
whom
does
one
turn
for
authority
and
concomitant
questions
of
what
exactly
--
what
authority
--
under
what
conditions
authority
will
be
granted.
we
don't
know
what
similar
two
distinctive
parts
mean.
it's
hard
to
tell
that
would
apply
to
a
woman
wearing
a
khaki
dress
with
epaulets
on
it
and
is
this
current
fashionable.
at
the
trial,
danny
sought
to
rely
on
10
u.s.c
772
at
the
exception
to
statute
in
the
maine.
the
government
says
that
he
was
not
entitled
to
a
submission
on
this
issue
and
we
say
that
he
was.
we
say
that
even
if
we
accept
the
government
--
the
government's
definition
of
what
a
theatrical
production
is,
he
may
still
be
entitled
to
the
submission
of
the
issue
that
the
trial
judge,
the
united
states
district
attorney
and
the
fifth
circuit,
court
of
appeal
saw
no
problem
with
the
submission
of
this
issue.
at
the
very
minimum,
we
feel
the
issue
was
raised
by
the
facts
of
the
trial.
mr.
david
h.
berg
no
sir,
there
is
none.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
of
course
that
inference
could
be
drawn,
but
we
say
that
that
doesn't
preclude
us
from
the
other
inference
that
the
government
simply
has
--
because
of
the
widespread
wearing
of
the
parts
of
the
uniform,
the
government
has
lost
its
interest
in
enforcing
the
statute.
mr.
david
h.
berg
your
honor,
we
have
the
evidence
that
it's
sold
on
a
wholesale
basis
throughout
the
nation
to
whomever
walks
in
the
store
and
we
ask
the
court
to
take
judicial
notice.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
your
honor,
there's
nothing
to
controvert
--
mr.
david
h.
berg
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
david
h.
berg
there's
nothing
in
the
evidence
to
indicate
which
way,
but
we
feel
that's
not
--
that
that
wouldn't
be
a
question
in
the
case
because
one
could
still
fall
within
the
proscription
of
the
statute
by
wearing
parts
--
that
are
distinctive
parts
of
the
uniform.
this
is
of
course,
the
first
time
--
the
point
i
was
--
i
had
raised
before
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
--
or
i
was
--
i
would
like
to
raise
the
question,
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
under
which
the
defendant
was
forced
to
defend.
if
it
can
be
agreed
that
he
was
entitled
at
least
to
a
submission
to
the
jury
on
the
issue,
then
we
must
deal
with
the
exception
which
says
that
one
may
wear
distinctive
parts
in
a
play
so
long
as
that
portrayal
does
not
tend
to
discredit
the
armed
force
portray.
we
feel
that
the
words
tend
to
discredit
are
unconstitutional
at
least
on
two
and
possibly
three
grounds.
one,
there
is
a
grant
of
power,
a
privilege
to
act
in
a
play
under
the
statute.
and
then
it's
unconstitutionally
conditioned
on
the
substance
of
what's
in
the
play.
we
feel
secondly
that
the
play
itself
--
that
one
engaged
in
criticism
of
the
government,
is
constitutionally
protected
and
thus
the
effect,
the
net
effect
of
this
portion
of
the
statute,
of
the
exception
of
the
statute
is
to
schacht's
first
amendment
freedom.
one
really
doesn't
know
exactly
what
he
can
say
or
what
he
can
do
under
the
prescription
of
the
exception.
finally,
of
course
we
don't
understand
exactly
what
the
words
tend
to
discredit
mean
anyway.
tend
to
discredit
is
possibly
as
vague
as
words
could
be
--
when
words
are
being
prohibited.
we
are
left
then
if
we
can
accept
the
unconstitutional,
the
exception
to
the
exception
of
being
unconstitutional.
we
are
left
simply
with
18
u.s.c
702
and
as
an
exception
which
says
one
may
wear
these
parts
in
a
play,
and
what
does
this
leave
us
with.
we
are
left
with
the
question
of
what
theatrical,
a
motion
picture
production
actually
means.
and
the
only
way
to
purchase
certainty
in
this
area
is
to
go
ahead
and
appear
in
what
you
think
is
a
motion
picture,
a
theatrical
production
and
see
if
you're
brought
the
trial
if
you're
wearing
a
symbolic
--
if
you're
wearing
as
in
danny's
case
parts
of
an
armed
forces
uniform.
the
vagueness
contained
therein
is
offensive
to
the
fifth
and
first
amendment,
the
schacht's
first
amendment
rights
and
what
it
actually
does
is
grant
a
license
to
whomever
is
in
charge
of
bringing
--
of
bringing
charges,
it
give
a
license
to
them,
an
official
of
the
government
to
bring
charges
in
cases
where
he
doesn't
agree
with
what
is
being
said
in
a
play
or
if
–
and
he
can
use
the
vagueness
of
the
word
production
to
justify
the
imposition
of
this
charge.
we
judged
briefly
before
on
considerations
of
the
verdict
itself,
the
general
verdict.
and
the
first
consideration
is
whether
or
not
we
can
tell
under
the
exception
itself,
if
we
can
agree
that
the
exception
should
have
been
submitted
why
petitioner
was
convicted.
he
was
either
convicted
because
first,
he
was
wearing
parts
of
the
uniform.
and
secondly,
because
he
was
either
in
a
play
that
discredited
in
which
case
we
feel
he
should
have
been
acquitted
or
he
was
not
in
a
play
at
all
in
which
case
we
feel
the
holding
of
the
street
case
would
at
least
compel
a
reversal
on
this
man.
mr.
david
h.
berg
your
honor,
it
was
enacted
in
1916
with
--
and
we
were
unable
to
obtain
any
of
the
history
at
that
time.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
sir.
it
was
revised
in
1940
and
then
in
1956,
1940
of
course
again
during
--
mr.
david
h.
berg
the
only
history
that
i've
seen
was
in
testimony
that
was
introduced
by
the
government
in
its
brief
which
said
that
there
was
no
intention
to
subsequently
change
the
law.
if
this
court
were
to
find
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
on
its
face
that
petitioner
schacht
was
in
fact
--
and
that
petitioner
schacht
was
in
fact
not
entitled
to
a
submission
on
the
issue
that
it
was
applied
on
the
basis
of
the
constitutional
law
by
the
virtue
of
the
acts
that
he
performed.
we
still
say
that
the
application
of
this
law
to
schacht
denied
him
certain
fundamental
freedom
of
speech.
there
is
evidence,
a
widespread
wearing
of
the
uniform.
there
is
evidence
and
we
asked
the
court
to
again
to
take
judicial
notice
that
after
he's
constantly,
not
only
discredit
but
ridiculed
the
armed
force
that
they
seek
to
portray.
dr.
strangelove
is
a
good
example
of
that.
we
again
point
to
the
fact
of
lack
of
prosecution
of
under
the
statute
that
the
fact
that
danny
schacht
was
strangely
taking
part
in
a
protest
against
the
war
in
vietnam
when
the
law
was
suddenly
applied
to
him.
we
ask
the
court
to
read
the
record
and
check
the
vindictiveness
of
the
united
states
district
attorney's
closing
argument.
--
or
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
that
offense
then
we
would
take
it
and
run,
be
very
happy
with
it.
the
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
was
that
our
defendant
at
the
trial
admitted
that
he
intended
to
discredit
the
uniform
he
was
wearing.
mr.
david
h.
berg
well
he
--
that
of
course
--
with
that
of
course
is
the
point
is
to
whether
he
was
entitled
to
a
submission,
but
at
least
he
admitted
that
point
and
i
was
--
in
my
point
that
we
--
i
would
ask
this
court
to
find
that
that
part
was
unconstitutional.
if
in
fact
the
court
does
find
that
the
words
tend
to
discredit
are
unconstitutional,
again,
we
are
left
with
title
18
which
grants
an
exception
in
instances
of
plays
in
which
one
is
wearing
distinctive
parts
of
the
uniform.
there
are
pages
and
pages
in
the
transcript
which
exemplify
the
prosecuting
attorney,
the
defense
lawyer
and
the
judges'
confusion
over
exactly
what
production
means.
nobody
knows
exactly
what
it
means
within
the
framework
of
the
statute
and
they
finally
decide
on
the
webster
dictionary
definition.
of
course,
if
there
--
if
this
kind
of
confusion
exists
for
lawyers
and
for
the
judge
at
the
trial,
think
of
the
kind
of
burden
that
imposes
on
anyone
trying
to
make
a
good
faith
effort
to
ascertain
under
the
statute
whether
or
not
he's
going
to
be
in
a
motion
picture
or
theatrical
production.
we
say
the
statute
fails
for
this
reason.
this
presents
a
chilling
affect
on
first
amendment
rights.
one
must
step
back
and
just
fail
to
exercise
the
right
to
free
speech,
to
act
in
a
play
because
you
don't
know
whether
or
not
you're
accepted
under
the
statute.
but
more
importantly
to
us,
it
presents
an
opportunity
to
any
government
official
who
has
the
opportunity
to
bring
charges
under
the
statute
based
on
what
he
feels
is
a
violation
of
the
act
and
in
cases
where
he
doesn't
feel
that
the
production
can
be
proved
by
the
defendant.
what
this
means
to
us
is
that
defendant
schacht
was
tried
under
statute
that's
seldom
used.
although
there
is
widespread
disuse
of
--
although
there
is
widespread
wearing
of
distinctive
parts
of
the
uniform,
of
parts
similar
to
distinctive
parts
of
the
uniform.
he
wore
it
in
a
part
of
the
country
in
which
dissent
is
not
very
popular.
we
feel
that
the
law
was
unconstitutionally
applied
to
him
for
the
sole
purpose
of
punishing
his
participation
in
the
act,
any
vietnam
war
skit.
there
are
record
references
which
support
this
contention,
very
short.
the
defense
attorney
209
--
the
prosecuting
attorney
at
209
says,
if
the
court
please,
in
our
original
charge
we
found
with
the
court,
we
did
provide
a
separate
charge.
we
feel
that
the
defendants
were
entitled
to
a
charge
with
respect
to
the
defense
and
if
i
may
present
this
to
the
court
now.
the
--
mr.
2406,
the
defense
attorney
says,
“excuse
me,
you
have
the
word
betrayal.
we
are
getting
kind
of
bad
aren't
we
instead
of
portrayal.”
mr.
k,
the
prosecuting
attorney
says,
“excuse
me,
we
have
betrayal.”
the
court
--
some
people
might
view
it
as
a
betrayal.
what
about
the
definition
of
those
terms?
in
the
closing
argument
at
382,
mr.
hartman
for
the
us
government
in
indicating
the
view
point,
indicating
the
view
point
of
this
office
about
this
sort
of
thing
that
danny
engaged
in.
if
it
pleases
the
court
ladies
and
gentlemen,
the
only
thing
i
gather
with
the
argument
of
these
defendants,
they
are
displeased
with
the
government
and
the
war,
but
i
have
a
single
answer
to
that.
there's
a
plane
and
a
boat
leaving,
two
or
three
times
a
day
for
other
parts
of
the
world.
i
could
probably
name
you
gentlemen
the
place
to
go.
you
can
leave
anytime
if
you
don't
like
and
then
you
stop.
at
384
he
says,
if
he
referring
to
the
defendants,
comes
to
my
house
and
expresses
himself
like
this,
he
will
not
be
able
to
walk
into
this
court
room
and
be
tried
again.
and
i
say
to
you,
there
are
many
others
likely.
i
don't
to
rub
shoulders
with
these
two,
do
you?
we
say
that
this
is
clear
evidence
that
what
we
have
here
is
not
a
case
involving
simply
the
wearing
of
distinctive
parts
of
the
uniform.
this
case
involves
suppression
of
my
client's
right
of
free
speech.
mr.
david
h.
berg
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
the
closing
argument.
mr.
david
h.
berg
and
prior
to
that
the
--
one
of
the
prosecuting
attorney
since
submitting
the
charge.
it
indicates
to
us
the
attitude
toward
what
danny
did,
to
what
he
said
in
that
at
least
in
the
southern
district
of
texas.
in
conclusion,
we
would
say,
having
addressed
ourselves
we
believe
to
the
legal
questions
involved
in
this
case
that
there
is
a
question
of
social
concern
here.
we
feel
that
the
imposition
of
this
sentence
on
danny
schacht
represents
a
certain
breech
of
faith
with
young
people
attempting
to
protest
certain
things
they
feel
that
are
wrong,
certain
things
they
feel
must
be
rectified.
this
court
has
a
perfect
opportunity
to
rectify
that
situation
and
to
correct
a
breach
of
faith
that
was
promulgated
not
on
the
fact
that
danny
schacht
was
wearing
parts
of
the
uniform,
but
on
the
fact
that
danny
schacht
dare
to
engage
in
a
dissent
gainst
the
war
in
vietnam.
mr.
david
h.
berg
none
whatsoever
sir.
mr.
david
h.
berg
no
sir.
mr.
david
h.
berg
no
sir.
there
is
no
contention
anywhere
in
the
record
that
there
was
anything
but
a
peaceful
and
orderly
demonstration.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes.
mr.
david
h.
berg
i
would
address
myself
to
that
point
just
briefly
your
honor.
we
feel
that
the
jurisdictional
question
as
we
understand
it
raised
by
the
government
is
answered
and
the
delegation
of
power
to
this
court
was
unrestricted.
no
restriction
placed
on
it,
was
placed
on
it
by
itself.
the
court
in
effect
has
said,
we'll
place
a
restriction
of
30
days,
and
the
power
to
make
that
rule
being
unrestricted,
we
feel
that
the
court
has
a
right
to
abrogate
that
rule.
further,
there's
another
contention
--
i
hope,
i'm
understanding
it
correctly,
there's
another
contention
in
the
petition
--
in
the
government's
brief
that
in
the
cases
where
this
court
has
waived
the
rule
and
i
think
specifically
the
hulson
case,
the
government
didn't
submit
a
brief
and
therefore
it's
not
bound
by
its
holding.
as
we
understand
this
contention,
we
feel
that
you've
failed,
it's
unsound
and
that
it's
the
business
of
the
court
to
raise
the
question
of
jurisdiction
itself
and
having
considered
that
point
made
its
ruling,
we
don't
see
any
difference
whether
the
full
submission
was
made
by
the
government
or
not?
mr.
david
h.
berg
we
will
rest
our
brief.
mr.
david
h.
berg
as
i
understood
the
distinction
by
the
government,
it
was
that
there
were
statutes
which
prohibit
a
granting
of
the
cert
after
90
days.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes,
it
will
--
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
it
does
your
honor.
there
was
a
submission
--
we
submitted
of
course
the
motion
for
leave
to
file
out
of
time
and
along
with
it
a
transcript
of
a
short
hearing
to
ascertain
exactly
why
the
brief
wasn't
followed
on
time.
and
i
can
tell
you
some
of
the
testimony
that
was
induced
at
that
time
was
that
the
--
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
sir.
the
point
of
that
hearing,
that
small
hearing
was
that
the
defendant
and
his
attorney
at
the
time,
an
acou
lawyer
just
had
apparently
write
down
a
communication
--
the
acou
lawyer
simply
left
the
time
go
by
without
obtaining
the
money
for
filing
of
the
transcript.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
sir.
mr.
david
h.
berg
thank
you.
mr.
david
h.
berg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
make
just
one
last
point
to
the
court
and
that
we
have
failed
at
least
in
our
opinion
defined
any
compelling
interest
suggested
by
the
government
for
the
enforcement
of
the
statute.
the
government
acknowledges
by
the
testimony
that
it
read
that
the
uniform
itself
was
symbolic
of
speech,
and
we
submit
again
that
absent
any
compelling
interest
to
regulate
that
action,
the
impingement
on
the
freedom
of
expression,
the
symbolic
act
that
the
petitioner
took
part
in
was
--
that
sort
of
impingement
is
not
allowable
under
the
holding
of
the
o'brien
case,
absent
of
compelling
interest.
mr.
david
h.
berg
if
--
excuse
me.
mr.
david
h.
berg
if
i
misunderstood
this
argument,
we
believe
the
facts
still
remains
that
schacht
testified
that
he
meant
the
uniform
as
showing
discredit
or
criticism
of
the
united
states.
mr.
david
h.
berg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner's
case
arises
out
of
his
conviction
under
title
18,
united
states
code
702,
which
prohibits
impertinent
part
being
authorized
to
wearing
of
distinctive
parts
of
arm
forces
uniform
are
parts
similar
to
distinctive
parts
of
the
armed
forces
uniform.
the
appendix
to
our
brief
sets
out
the
statutes
in
total.
the
conduct
that
the
defendant
at
the
trial
below
engaged
in
was
his
taking
part
in
a
vietnamese
protest.
the
protest
took
place
in
front
of
the
army
induction
center
in
houston
texas
on
december
4,
1967.
the
petitioner
was
wearing
as
part
of
the
protest,
parts
of
a
military
uniform.
his
part
in
the
protest
was
to
discord
a
water
gun
filled
with
red
ink
at
someone
dressed
as
a
viet
cong.
the
viet
cong
would
fall.
he
would
run,
shouting
“be
an
able
american”
to
the
fallen
viet
cong
and
say
“my
god,
this
is
a
pregnant
woman.”
after
his
performance
a
few
hours
later,
he
was
arrested
tried,
convicted
on
the
charge
that
i've
set
out
before.
his
sentence
was
six
months
to
be
served
and
a
$250.00
fine.
the
case
was
appealed
to
the
fifth
circuit
of
appeals
which
affirmed
the
conviction
and
the
supreme
court
granted
cert
on
december
15,
1969.
mr.
david
h.
berg
no
sir,
he
has
not.
mr.
david
h.
berg
well,
in
avertedly,
he
did.
the
petition
was
filed
out
of
time.
he
was
committed
for
three
weeks.
we
lodged
a
motion
for
leave
to
submit
out
of
time
which
was
granted.
he
was
released
from
prison.
it
is
our
contention
that
daniel
schacht
engaged
in
symbolic
speech
by
wearing
parts
of
a
military
uniform
during
the
skit.
we
feel
that
the
court's
first
inquiry
must
be
made
on
the
basis
of
the
holding
of
the
o'brien
decision
that
draft
card
burning
case.
that
case
held
if
we
understand
it
correctly
that
there
are
certain
areas
of
freedom
of
speech
which
the
government
may
impinge
upon
if
there's
a
clear
and
compelling
interest
of
the
government
to
be
protected
by
the
regulation
that
it
seeks
to
enforce.
it
is
our
contention
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
compelling
governmental
interest
in
regulating
the
wearing
of
distinctive
parts
or
parts
similar
to
distinctive
parts
of
an
armed
forces
uniform.
mr.
david
h.
berg
your
honor,
we
do
make
that
claim.
we
make
the
claim
that
he's
entitled
to
a
submission
on
the
question.
i
didn't
characterize
it
entirely.
it
was
a
skit
rehearsed
a
day
before.
mr.
david
h.
berg
no.
mr.
david
h.
berg
as
it
where
a
play
within
a
play,
within
a
demonstration.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
your
honor,
we
still
reach
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes.
--that
he
told
the
jury
that
if
they
file
it,
it
was
—within
the
statutory
exception,
they
should
acquit
him?
mr.
david
h.
berg
and
that
--
and
incidentally
that
charge
were
submitted
by
the
government's
attorney.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes,
we
did,
at
the
trial—
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
sir.
mr.
david
h.
berg
that's
correct.
mr.
david
h.
berg
because
the
statutory
scheme
graded
by
the
exception
itself
is
unconstitutional.
we
feel
that
the
government
--
by
that
i
mean
that
the
constitutional
scheme
is
one
which
punishes
one
--
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
sir.
mr.
david
h.
berg
well,
in
this
instance,
he
was
granted
the
--
he
was
given
a
submission
on
that
issue.
the
jury
nonetheless
found
him
guilty
and
we
say
that
the
entire
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
david
h.
berg
no
sir
that
we
can't
tell
from
the
case
either.
mr.
david
h.
berg
that's
correct,
under
the
holding
of
a
straight
case.
we
don't
know
why
this
man
was
convicted.
we
don't
know
whether
he
was
in
a
play
or
he
was
in
a
play
that
discredited
it?
mr.
david
h.
berg
someone
wearing
distinctive
parts
and
if
that
be
the
case
then
that
part
--
we
feel
that
part
of
the
exception
is
clearly
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
david
h.
berg
no
sir,
for
the
most
part--
mr.
david
h.
berg
if
there
is
no
issue
for
the
jury
on
the
basis
of
the
fact--
mr.
david
h.
berg
--
as
with
the
exception.
mr.
david
h.
berg
then
we
still
have
to
deal
with
whether
or
not
there's
a
compelling
interest.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
sir.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes.
we
feel
that
a
constitutional
decision
would--
mr.
david
h.
berg
your
honor,
if
the
facts
of
the
case
clearly
indicate
that
he
fell
within
the
exception,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
still
whether
or
not
that
exception
--
mr.
david
h.
berg
it
did
go
to
the
jury.
mr.
david
h.
berg
unless
i
misunderstand
sir,
it
did
go
to
the
jury?
mr.
david
h.
berg
under
the
holding
of
the
o'brien
decision,
it's
our
contention
whether
or
not
he's
entitled
to
an
instruction
on
the
statutory
--
the
exception
to
the
main
statute.
the
government
has
exhibited
no
compelling
interest
in
controlling
whether
or
not
one
may
wear
distinctive
parts
of
armed
forces
uniform
or
part
similar
to
distinctive
parts.
mr.
david
h.
berg
mr.
justice
stewart
i
would
concede
only
that
he
had
on
parts
of
a
military
uniform
but
not
characterize
it,
it
was
distinctive.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes,
yes
sir.
mr.
david
h.
berg
well,
one
of
the
questions
we
raised
sir
is
that
we
don't
know
what
word
distinctive
part
means
and
we
don't
know
whether
--
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
sir.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes.
mr.
david
h.
berg
it
doesn't
to
--
excuse
me
sir,
it
doesn't
really
matter
to
us
if
we
want
to
characterize
it
as
having
worn
a
distinctive
part,
our
point
we
feel
is
still
the
same.
that
the
--
mr.
david
h.
berg
well,
if
i
understand
the
question
correctly,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
fact
is
in
dispute
that
he
was
wearing
a
distinctive
part
of
the
uniform.
mr.
david
h.
berg
alright,
and
it's
our
contention
that
that's
one
of
the
problems
of
the
statute.
we
have
no
way
of
telling
sir
whether
or
not
he
was
wearing
a
distinctive
part.
if
he
wasn't
then
he's
not
guilty
to
begin
with.
if
he
was,
then
we
still
have
problems
with
the
statute.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes.
mr.
david
h.
berg
your
honor,
from
the
verdict
that
was
returned,
we
can
only
assume
that--
mr.
david
h.
berg
no.
but
we
don't
know
that
they
didn't
convict
him
on
these
grounds
that
he
was
wearing
a
similar
part,
a
part
similar
to
a
distinctive
part.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes.
that
at
least
that
the
jury
--
mr.
david
h.
berg
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
sir.
that
would
be
prerequisite
finding.
mr.
david
h.
berg
an
eagle
insignia
turned
upside
down.
mr.
david
h.
berg
an
eagle
insignia
turned
upside
down
on
an
obsolete
world
war
ii
hat.
a
blouse
and
some
bottoms
and
a

mr.
david
h.
berg
an
army
blouse.
mr.
david
h.
berg
buttons
on
the
blouse?
mr.
david
h.
berg
military
buttons
on
the
blouse
and
the
cap
he
uses
i
remember
were
not
military
issue
and
some
civilian

mr.
david
h.
berg
spread

mr.
david
h.
berg
the
spread
eagle.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
sir.
the
government
would
seek
to
tell
us
to
justify
the
imposition
or
the
impingement
of
daniel
schachts.
first
amendment
rights,
the
right
to
where
this
parts
of
the
uniform
on
the
basis
that
government
has
some
sort
of
overwhelming
interest
in
regulating
this
wearing.
it's
our
contention
from
the
facts
of
the
trial
that
the
government
in
fact
sells
the
jobbers
all
over
the
nation,
the
parts
of
the
uniform
which
later
end
up
in
the
hands
of
the
people
who
wear
it.
this
court
might
take
note
of
the
fact
that
the
army
jacket
is
worn
by
many
people,
the
army
raincoat.
parts
that
look
similar,
two
parts
of
an
army
uniform
are
widespread
worn
by
young
people
especially
by
young
people.
and
if
the
interest
in
regulating
this
wearing
was
so
overwhelming,
then
it
would
appear
to
us
that
the
government
would
not
sell
on
a
wholesale
basis
to
jobbers
across
the
nation.
if
there
is
a
government
interest
in
the
distinctive
wearing,
they
simply
have
it
sought
to
it
to
assert
that
interest.
we
have
been
unable
to
find
very
many
cases
under
the
statutes
where
convictions
at
least
have
occurred
under
18702.
in
fact,
four
since
1940
and
i
believe
the
statute
in
one
form
or
another
has
been
in
the
book
since
1960.
of
course
--
mr.
david
h.
berg
our
point,
my
point
that
there's
some
evidence
the
government
is
not
interested
enforcing
the
statute.
mr.
david
h.
berg
in
this
particular
case,
we
feel
it's
evidence
of
the
government's
lack
of
a
compelling
interest
in
impinging
his
first
amendment,
in
regulating
the
wear
and
therefore
impinging
his
rights,
constitutional
rights.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
sir,
i
believe
that
there
is
a
statute.
mr.
david
h.
berg
about
the
impersonation,
is
there,
and
that
would
be
our
point
that
this
type
--
this
kind
of
protection
could
be
garnered
for
the
government
and
more
narrow
stand.
mr.
david
h.
berg
i
believe
that
there
is
a
penalty
for
personating
an
officer
that
applies
to
civilian
just
for
making
a
meal
ticket
of
the
uniform
one
way
or
another.
i
raise
briefly
the
question
of
the
vagueness
of
the
statute.
we
feel
that
if
the
court
should
find
that
there
is
some
compelling
interest
in
regulating
the
wearing
of
the
distinctive
parts
of
the
uniform,
that
there
is
still
a
question
under
the
statute,
18702
as
to
what
authority
--
authorized
means
under
the
statute
to
whom
does
one
turn
for
authority
and
concomitant
questions
of
what
exactly
--
what
authority
--
under
what
conditions
authority
will
be
granted.
we
don't
know
what
similar
two
distinctive
parts
mean.
it's
hard
to
tell
that
would
apply
to
a
woman
wearing
a
khaki
dress
with
epaulets
on
it
and
is
this
current
fashionable.
at
the
trial,
danny
sought
to
rely
on
10
u.s.c
772
at
the
exception
to
statute
in
the
maine.
the
government
says
that
he
was
not
entitled
to
a
submission
on
this
issue
and
we
say
that
he
was.
we
say
that
even
if
we
accept
the
government
--
the
government's
definition
of
what
a
theatrical
production
is,
he
may
still
be
entitled
to
the
submission
of
the
issue
that
the
trial
judge,
the
united
states
district
attorney
and
the
fifth
circuit,
court
of
appeal
saw
no
problem
with
the
submission
of
this
issue.
at
the
very
minimum,
we
feel
the
issue
was
raised
by
the
facts
of
the
trial.
mr.
david
h.
berg
no
sir,
there
is
none.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
of
course
that
inference
could
be
drawn,
but
we
say
that
that
doesn't
preclude
us
from
the
other
inference
that
the
government
simply
has
--
because
of
the
widespread
wearing
of
the
parts
of
the
uniform,
the
government
has
lost
its
interest
in
enforcing
the
statute.
mr.
david
h.
berg
your
honor,
we
have
the
evidence
that
it's
sold
on
a
wholesale
basis
throughout
the
nation
to
whomever
walks
in
the
store
and
we
ask
the
court
to
take
judicial
notice.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
your
honor,
there's
nothing
to
controvert
--
mr.
david
h.
berg
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
david
h.
berg
there's
nothing
in
the
evidence
to
indicate
which
way,
but
we
feel
that's
not
--
that
that
wouldn't
be
a
question
in
the
case
because
one
could
still
fall
within
the
proscription
of
the
statute
by
wearing
parts
--
that
are
distinctive
parts
of
the
uniform.
this
is
of
course,
the
first
time
--
the
point
i
was
--
i
had
raised
before
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
--
or
i
was
--
i
would
like
to
raise
the
question,
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
under
which
the
defendant
was
forced
to
defend.
if
it
can
be
agreed
that
he
was
entitled
at
least
to
a
submission
to
the
jury
on
the
issue,
then
we
must
deal
with
the
exception
which
says
that
one
may
wear
distinctive
parts
in
a
play
so
long
as
that
portrayal
does
not
tend
to
discredit
the
armed
force
portray.
we
feel
that
the
words
tend
to
discredit
are
unconstitutional
at
least
on
two
and
possibly
three
grounds.
one,
there
is
a
grant
of
power,
a
privilege
to
act
in
a
play
under
the
statute.
and
then
it's
unconstitutionally
conditioned
on
the
substance
of
what's
in
the
play.
we
feel
secondly
that
the
play
itself
--
that
one
engaged
in
criticism
of
the
government,
is
constitutionally
protected
and
thus
the
effect,
the
net
effect
of
this
portion
of
the
statute,
of
the
exception
of
the
statute
is
to
schacht's
first
amendment
freedom.
one
really
doesn't
know
exactly
what
he
can
say
or
what
he
can
do
under
the
prescription
of
the
exception.
finally,
of
course
we
don't
understand
exactly
what
the
words
tend
to
discredit
mean
anyway.
tend
to
discredit
is
possibly
as
vague
as
words
could
be
--
when
words
are
being
prohibited.
we
are
left
then
if
we
can
accept
the
unconstitutional,
the
exception
to
the
exception
of
being
unconstitutional.
we
are
left
simply
with
18
u.s.c
702
and
as
an
exception
which
says
one
may
wear
these
parts
in
a
play,
and
what
does
this
leave
us
with.
we
are
left
with
the
question
of
what
theatrical,
a
motion
picture
production
actually
means.
and
the
only
way
to
purchase
certainty
in
this
area
is
to
go
ahead
and
appear
in
what
you
think
is
a
motion
picture,
a
theatrical
production
and
see
if
you're
brought
the
trial
if
you're
wearing
a
symbolic
--
if
you're
wearing
as
in
danny's
case
parts
of
an
armed
forces
uniform.
the
vagueness
contained
therein
is
offensive
to
the
fifth
and
first
amendment,
the
schacht's
first
amendment
rights
and
what
it
actually
does
is
grant
a
license
to
whomever
is
in
charge
of
bringing
--
of
bringing
charges,
it
give
a
license
to
them,
an
official
of
the
government
to
bring
charges
in
cases
where
he
doesn't
agree
with
what
is
being
said
in
a
play
or
if
–
and
he
can
use
the
vagueness
of
the
word
production
to
justify
the
imposition
of
this
charge.
we
judged
briefly
before
on
considerations
of
the
verdict
itself,
the
general
verdict.
and
the
first
consideration
is
whether
or
not
we
can
tell
under
the
exception
itself,
if
we
can
agree
that
the
exception
should
have
been
submitted
why
petitioner
was
convicted.
he
was
either
convicted
because
first,
he
was
wearing
parts
of
the
uniform.
and
secondly,
because
he
was
either
in
a
play
that
discredited
in
which
case
we
feel
he
should
have
been
acquitted
or
he
was
not
in
a
play
at
all
in
which
case
we
feel
the
holding
of
the
street
case
would
at
least
compel
a
reversal
on
this
man.
mr.
david
h.
berg
your
honor,
it
was
enacted
in
1916
with
--
and
we
were
unable
to
obtain
any
of
the
history
at
that
time.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
sir.
it
was
revised
in
1940
and
then
in
1956,
1940
of
course
again
during
--
mr.
david
h.
berg
the
only
history
that
i've
seen
was
in
testimony
that
was
introduced
by
the
government
in
its
brief
which
said
that
there
was
no
intention
to
subsequently
change
the
law.
if
this
court
were
to
find
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
on
its
face
that
petitioner
schacht
was
in
fact
--
and
that
petitioner
schacht
was
in
fact
not
entitled
to
a
submission
on
the
issue
that
it
was
applied
on
the
basis
of
the
constitutional
law
by
the
virtue
of
the
acts
that
he
performed.
we
still
say
that
the
application
of
this
law
to
schacht
denied
him
certain
fundamental
freedom
of
speech.
there
is
evidence,
a
widespread
wearing
of
the
uniform.
there
is
evidence
and
we
asked
the
court
to
again
to
take
judicial
notice
that
after
he's
constantly,
not
only
discredit
but
ridiculed
the
armed
force
that
they
seek
to
portray.
dr.
strangelove
is
a
good
example
of
that.
we
again
point
to
the
fact
of
lack
of
prosecution
of
under
the
statute
that
the
fact
that
danny
schacht
was
strangely
taking
part
in
a
protest
against
the
war
in
vietnam
when
the
law
was
suddenly
applied
to
him.
we
ask
the
court
to
read
the
record
and
check
the
vindictiveness
of
the
united
states
district
attorney's
closing
argument.
--
or
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
that
offense
then
we
would
take
it
and
run,
be
very
happy
with
it.
the
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
was
that
our
defendant
at
the
trial
admitted
that
he
intended
to
discredit
the
uniform
he
was
wearing.
mr.
david
h.
berg
well
he
--
that
of
course
--
with
that
of
course
is
the
point
is
to
whether
he
was
entitled
to
a
submission,
but
at
least
he
admitted
that
point
and
i
was
--
in
my
point
that
we
--
i
would
ask
this
court
to
find
that
that
part
was
unconstitutional.
if
in
fact
the
court
does
find
that
the
words
tend
to
discredit
are
unconstitutional,
again,
we
are
left
with
title
18
which
grants
an
exception
in
instances
of
plays
in
which
one
is
wearing
distinctive
parts
of
the
uniform.
there
are
pages
and
pages
in
the
transcript
which
exemplify
the
prosecuting
attorney,
the
defense
lawyer
and
the
judges'
confusion
over
exactly
what
production
means.
nobody
knows
exactly
what
it
means
within
the
framework
of
the
statute
and
they
finally
decide
on
the
webster
dictionary
definition.
of
course,
if
there
--
if
this
kind
of
confusion
exists
for
lawyers
and
for
the
judge
at
the
trial,
think
of
the
kind
of
burden
that
imposes
on
anyone
trying
to
make
a
good
faith
effort
to
ascertain
under
the
statute
whether
or
not
he's
going
to
be
in
a
motion
picture
or
theatrical
production.
we
say
the
statute
fails
for
this
reason.
this
presents
a
chilling
affect
on
first
amendment
rights.
one
must
step
back
and
just
fail
to
exercise
the
right
to
free
speech,
to
act
in
a
play
because
you
don't
know
whether
or
not
you're
accepted
under
the
statute.
but
more
importantly
to
us,
it
presents
an
opportunity
to
any
government
official
who
has
the
opportunity
to
bring
charges
under
the
statute
based
on
what
he
feels
is
a
violation
of
the
act
and
in
cases
where
he
doesn't
feel
that
the
production
can
be
proved
by
the
defendant.
what
this
means
to
us
is
that
defendant
schacht
was
tried
under
statute
that's
seldom
used.
although
there
is
widespread
disuse
of
--
although
there
is
widespread
wearing
of
distinctive
parts
of
the
uniform,
of
parts
similar
to
distinctive
parts
of
the
uniform.
he
wore
it
in
a
part
of
the
country
in
which
dissent
is
not
very
popular.
we
feel
that
the
law
was
unconstitutionally
applied
to
him
for
the
sole
purpose
of
punishing
his
participation
in
the
act,
any
vietnam
war
skit.
there
are
record
references
which
support
this
contention,
very
short.
the
defense
attorney
209
--
the
prosecuting
attorney
at
209
says,
if
the
court
please,
in
our
original
charge
we
found
with
the
court,
we
did
provide
a
separate
charge.
we
feel
that
the
defendants
were
entitled
to
a
charge
with
respect
to
the
defense
and
if
i
may
present
this
to
the
court
now.
the
--
mr.
2406,
the
defense
attorney
says,
“excuse
me,
you
have
the
word
betrayal.
we
are
getting
kind
of
bad
aren't
we
instead
of
portrayal.”
mr.
k,
the
prosecuting
attorney
says,
“excuse
me,
we
have
betrayal.”
the
court
--
some
people
might
view
it
as
a
betrayal.
what
about
the
definition
of
those
terms?
in
the
closing
argument
at
382,
mr.
hartman
for
the
us
government
in
indicating
the
view
point,
indicating
the
view
point
of
this
office
about
this
sort
of
thing
that
danny
engaged
in.
if
it
pleases
the
court
ladies
and
gentlemen,
the
only
thing
i
gather
with
the
argument
of
these
defendants,
they
are
displeased
with
the
government
and
the
war,
but
i
have
a
single
answer
to
that.
there's
a
plane
and
a
boat
leaving,
two
or
three
times
a
day
for
other
parts
of
the
world.
i
could
probably
name
you
gentlemen
the
place
to
go.
you
can
leave
anytime
if
you
don't
like
and
then
you
stop.
at
384
he
says,
if
he
referring
to
the
defendants,
comes
to
my
house
and
expresses
himself
like
this,
he
will
not
be
able
to
walk
into
this
court
room
and
be
tried
again.
and
i
say
to
you,
there
are
many
others
likely.
i
don't
to
rub
shoulders
with
these
two,
do
you?
we
say
that
this
is
clear
evidence
that
what
we
have
here
is
not
a
case
involving
simply
the
wearing
of
distinctive
parts
of
the
uniform.
this
case
involves
suppression
of
my
client's
right
of
free
speech.
mr.
david
h.
berg
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
the
closing
argument.
mr.
david
h.
berg
and
prior
to
that
the
--
one
of
the
prosecuting
attorney
since
submitting
the
charge.
it
indicates
to
us
the
attitude
toward
what
danny
did,
to
what
he
said
in
that
at
least
in
the
southern
district
of
texas.
in
conclusion,
we
would
say,
having
addressed
ourselves
we
believe
to
the
legal
questions
involved
in
this
case
that
there
is
a
question
of
social
concern
here.
we
feel
that
the
imposition
of
this
sentence
on
danny
schacht
represents
a
certain
breech
of
faith
with
young
people
attempting
to
protest
certain
things
they
feel
that
are
wrong,
certain
things
they
feel
must
be
rectified.
this
court
has
a
perfect
opportunity
to
rectify
that
situation
and
to
correct
a
breach
of
faith
that
was
promulgated
not
on
the
fact
that
danny
schacht
was
wearing
parts
of
the
uniform,
but
on
the
fact
that
danny
schacht
dare
to
engage
in
a
dissent
gainst
the
war
in
vietnam.
mr.
david
h.
berg
none
whatsoever
sir.
mr.
david
h.
berg
no
sir.
mr.
david
h.
berg
no
sir.
there
is
no
contention
anywhere
in
the
record
that
there
was
anything
but
a
peaceful
and
orderly
demonstration.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes.
mr.
david
h.
berg
i
would
address
myself
to
that
point
just
briefly
your
honor.
we
feel
that
the
jurisdictional
question
as
we
understand
it
raised
by
the
government
is
answered
and
the
delegation
of
power
to
this
court
was
unrestricted.
no
restriction
placed
on
it,
was
placed
on
it
by
itself.
the
court
in
effect
has
said,
we'll
place
a
restriction
of
30
days,
and
the
power
to
make
that
rule
being
unrestricted,
we
feel
that
the
court
has
a
right
to
abrogate
that
rule.
further,
there's
another
contention
--
i
hope,
i'm
understanding
it
correctly,
there's
another
contention
in
the
petition
--
in
the
government's
brief
that
in
the
cases
where
this
court
has
waived
the
rule
and
i
think
specifically
the
hulson
case,
the
government
didn't
submit
a
brief
and
therefore
it's
not
bound
by
its
holding.
as
we
understand
this
contention,
we
feel
that
you've
failed,
it's
unsound
and
that
it's
the
business
of
the
court
to
raise
the
question
of
jurisdiction
itself
and
having
considered
that
point
made
its
ruling,
we
don't
see
any
difference
whether
the
full
submission
was
made
by
the
government
or
not?
mr.
david
h.
berg
we
will
rest
our
brief.
mr.
david
h.
berg
as
i
understood
the
distinction
by
the
government,
it
was
that
there
were
statutes
which
prohibit
a
granting
of
the
cert
after
90
days.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes,
it
will
--
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
it
does
your
honor.
there
was
a
submission
--
we
submitted
of
course
the
motion
for
leave
to
file
out
of
time
and
along
with
it
a
transcript
of
a
short
hearing
to
ascertain
exactly
why
the
brief
wasn't
followed
on
time.
and
i
can
tell
you
some
of
the
testimony
that
was
induced
at
that
time
was
that
the
--
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
sir.
the
point
of
that
hearing,
that
small
hearing
was
that
the
defendant
and
his
attorney
at
the
time,
an
acou
lawyer
just
had
apparently
write
down
a
communication
--
the
acou
lawyer
simply
left
the
time
go
by
without
obtaining
the
money
for
filing
of
the
transcript.
mr.
david
h.
berg
yes
sir.
mr.
david
h.
berg
thank
you.
mr.
david
h.
berg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
make
just
one
last
point
to
the
court
and
that
we
have
failed
at
least
in
our
opinion
defined
any
compelling
interest
suggested
by
the
government
for
the
enforcement
of
the
statute.
the
government
acknowledges
by
the
testimony
that
it
read
that
the
uniform
itself
was
symbolic
of
speech,
and
we
submit
again
that
absent
any
compelling
interest
to
regulate
that
action,
the
impingement
on
the
freedom
of
expression,
the
symbolic
act
that
the
petitioner
took
part
in
was
--
that
sort
of
impingement
is
not
allowable
under
the
holding
of
the
o'brien
case,
absent
of
compelling
interest.
mr.
david
h.
berg
if
--
excuse
me.
mr.
david
h.
berg
if
i
misunderstood
this
argument,
we
believe
the
facts
still
remains
that
schacht
testified
that
he
meant
the
uniform
as
showing
discredit
or
criticism
of
the
united
states.
