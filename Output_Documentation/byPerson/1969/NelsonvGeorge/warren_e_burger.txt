chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
argument
this
morning
is
number
595
that's
nelson
against
george.
mrs.
renne,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
renne
does
the
state
of
california
have
any
option
when
another
state
places
a
detainer
on
a
prisoner
who
is
incarcerated
in
a
california
institution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
mrs.
renne
if
you
indulged
in
what
seems
to
be
this
very
cavalier
treatment
of
the
sister
states,
you
probably
could
expect
reciprocity
the
next
time
the
situation
were
reversed
could
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
what
would
be
left
of
the
doctrine
of
comity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mrs.
renne,
mr.
cumming.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
not
suggesting
this
case
is
on
all
force
with
the
case
you're
referring
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cumming,
what
is
the
significance
of
the
detainer
in
this
sense
if
i
may
try
to
play
this
up
in
my
own
mind.
suppose
california
just
of
its
own
volition
not
under
any
pressure
of
any
court
or
any
other
source,
just
simply
said,
“we
no
longer
accept
detainers
from
anybody.”
does
that
prevent
the
state
of
north
carolina
from
plucking
this
fellow
as
soon
as
his
released
from
custody
in
california?
what's
the
process
by
--
what
would
stop
them
from
doing
that
independent
of
a
detainer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
part
of
this
arrangement
is
to
have
something
more
flexible
than
an
extradition,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
could
counsel
--
suppose
it
come
to
the
day
when
california's
sentences
are
running
out.
it
comes
to
that
last
day,
could
california
hold
him
in
custody
for
even
one
hour
after
the
sentence
had
expired
in
order
to
accommodate
another
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
isn't
that
at
the
expiration
of
the
sentence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
it
--
are
you
suggesting
it
could
be
two
weeks,
two
months,
six
months
later?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
if
he
didn't
discharge
him
the
prisoner
will
have
a
pretty
good
habeas
corpus
claim,
wouldn’t
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
about
this
unquestioned
power
that
you
speak
of.
what
would
be
the
source
of
the
power
to
the
california
federal
court
to
interfere
with
the
state
of
north
carolina
picking
up
a
prisoner
at
the
end
of
his
term
in
california?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
have
you
served
any
piece
of
paper
on
the
state
of
north
carolina?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
no
claim
has
been
made
by
you,
i
take
it
from
the
outset
that
the
california
warden
is
the
agent
of
the
state
of
north
carolina?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
a
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
unreasonable
to
say
that
the
most
meaningful
time
to
test
that
conviction
was
while
he
was
still
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
immediately
following
the
trial
when
everything
was
fresh
in
the
minds
of
everyone?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
try
a
little
variation
of
justice
marshall's
question.
suppose
not
california
but
north
carolina
voluntarily
surrenders,
waives
its
detainer
agreement
in
california.
where
have
you
got
any
jurisdiction
in
the
state
of
california
federal
courts,
state
courts,
or
any
other
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
just
simply
says
we
withdraw
our
detainer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
waives
the
detainer
but
that
doesn't
prevent
them
from
having
three
deputy
sheriffs
in
north
carolina
sitting
outside
the
east
gate
as
mr.
justice
marshall
suggested
to
pick
him
up.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
is
it
possible
we're
engaged
in
something
of
an
exercise
in
futility
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
unless,
we
assume
that
north
carolina
is
just
going
to
let
this
man
walk
off
in
the
case
of
their
conviction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
do
concede
that
if
north
carolina
surrenders
its
detainer,
that
no
california
federal
court
has
any
jurisdiction?
your
entire
jurisdictional
theme
rests
upon
the
agency
concept,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why?
i
thought
we
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
cumming.
mrs.
renne,
you
have
four
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
brings
us
back
to
the
exhaustion
point
that
mr.
justice
brennan
was
raising.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
he
has
an
obligation
to
try
to
see
if
the
north
carolina
procedures
will
reach
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
for
your
submission
mrs.
renne.
thank
you
mr.
cumming,
you
were
appointed
by
the
court.
we
want
to
thank
you
for
your
assistance
to
the
court
and
of
course
assistance
to
the
petitioner.
the
case
is
