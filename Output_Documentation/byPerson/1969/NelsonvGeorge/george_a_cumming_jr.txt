mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
might
it
please
the
court.
i'm
george
cumming
of
san
francisco,
counsel
for
respondent,
john
edward
george.
i
think
having
in
mind
the
considerations
which
led
this
court
to
its
unanimous
decision
in
peyton
v.
rowe
two
terms
ago,
we're
here
today
to
consider
whether
or
not
respondent
george
is
entitled
to
a
timely
and
therefore
meaningful
hearing
on
the
constitutional
claims
that
he
makes
with
respect
to
the
north
carolina
conviction.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
no
i'm
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
a
difference
obviously
peyton
v.
rowe
dealt
with
prisoner
facing
consecutive
sentences
imposed
by
one
state.
this
involves
two
states.
i
would
say
at
the
outset
however
that
this
distinction
has
been
presented
before
courts
of
appeal
and
in
that
number
i
think
some
16
judges
and
none
of
those
16
who
considered
the
matter
here
before
have
considered
that
to
be
a
meaningful
distinction
between
peyton
and
this
case.
particularly
with
regard
to
peyton's
discussion
and
basis
of
the
desirability
and
indeed
perhaps
the
necessity
of
an
early
hearing
on
these
claims,
lest
records,
witnesses
and
evidence
be
washed
by
the
passage
of
time.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
and
he
is
presently
confined
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
in
the
northern
district
of
california.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
that's
correct,
that's
i
suppose
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
he
is
presently
confined
along
the
lines
of
peyton
v.
rowe.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
think
independent
of
a
--
we
have
to
go
back
in
time
in
this
case
a
little
bit.
california
and
north
carolina
are
parties
to
the
detainer
grade,
pursuant
to
that
agreement,
north
carolina
obtained
temporary
custody
of
respondent
in
order
to
try
him.
the
process
for
trying
him
absent
while
he
was
serving
a
california
sentence,
absent
this
detainer
agreement,
i'm
not
sure.
it
seems
to
me
that
some
of
the
problems
in
this
respect
were
canvassed
by
the
court’s
decision
last
term
in
smith
v.
hooey.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
that's
correct,
the
respondent's
application
under
this
detainer
agreement
to
be
released
in
north
carolina
for
trial
is
deemed
to
be
a
labor
of
extradition
by
him.
both
to
go
to
north
carolina
to
be
tried
and
to
return
to
north
carolina
to
serve
any
sentence
there
imposed.
the
detainer
agreement
states
that
specifically,
i
believe
its
article
iii
(e).
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
believe
that
it
could,
under
the
detainer
agreement.
the
agreement
states
that
the
warden
in
this
case
california
has
a
lawful
and
mandatory
duty
to
give
over
the
person
of
any
prisoner
whenever
required
by
the
detainer
agreement.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
yes.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
suppose
if
north
carolina
did
not
show
up
having
previously
been
notified,
this
apparently
there
is
an
administrative
provision
for
the
notification
in
advance
of
the
expiration
and
if
they
didn’t
show
up
then
inquiries
failed
to
discover
why.
i
suppose
he
could
with
impunity
at
that
point
discharge
the
prisoner.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
certainly
would,
there
would
be
at
that
point
nothing,
no
authority
i
would
think
for
the
warden
to
hold
it.
i
suppose
from
the
detainer
agreement
you
could
probably
infer
some
sort
of
authority
for
a
short
time
to
accommodate
the
agents
of
north
carolina
to
make
the
trip
to
california
and
pick
him
up.
perhaps,
it
would
require
that
they
show
up
on
a
release
day
so
as
to
take
him
into
their
own
custody
immediately
as
he
pass
through
the
gate
of
san
quentin.
i'm
not
sure
so
that
there
is
come
down
perhaps
to
a
split
second.
in
any
event,
this
case
involves
a
situation
where
at
least
on
the
record
thus
far
and
on
the
detainer
agreement,
the
warden
is
bound
to
give
respondent
over
to
north
carolina
upon
the
completion
of
his
valid
sentence
in
california.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
if
kansas
has
a
detainer
outstanding
at
this
time
on
an
untried
charge,
that
detainer
may
or
may
not
be
in
existence
at
the
time
that
respondent
is
released
from
california
custody
because
petitioner
has
no
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
petitioners
suggest
that
they
honor
the
matters
on
a
basis
of
that
detainer
first
received
and
i
guess
the
kansas
detainer
was
first
received.
he
would
honor
that
one
first
and
release
the
petitioner
to
kansas.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
suppose
it
is
in
this
sense
that
if
we
remain
in
the
situation
where
the
--
whereas
the
warden’s
discretion
as
to
what
to
do
about
these
detainers
that
is
if
we
stay
out
of
court
as
the
warden
urges
that
we
ought
to
do.
then
we
are
in
a
difficult
situation
but
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
would
like
to
get
this
matter
on
for
hearing
in
the
district
court
to
find
out
the
validity
of
this
north
carolina
sentence
and
then
approach
the
district
court
for
an
appropriate
or
to
deal
with
this
complicated
problems.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
that
was
at
his
request
under
the
detainer
agreement.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
yes,
he
does.
he
wants
to
attack
it,
may
i
say
at
a
time
which
he
feels
that
his
attack
can
be
meaningful.
that
is
of
the
time
when
the
evidence
and
the
witnesses
and
so
forth
may
be
available
to
him.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
this
obviously
presents
a
problem
to
him.
this
relates
to
the
second
question
that
the
petitioner
suggests
has
posed
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
appropriate
form.
under
ahrens
against
clark
however,
if
there
is
any
relief
available
to
him.
it
is
only
in
the
district
court
he
is
now
confined.
now
if
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
that
is
so,
he
is
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
am
not
familiar
with
that.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
might
very
well.
i
am
familiar
however
with
the
decision
in
word
against
north
carolina
which
happen
to
involve
the
same
state.
and
as
i
recall
that
decision,
they
suggested
that
post-conviction
relief
was
not
available
in
north
carolina
unless
the
petitioner
was
physically
incarcerated
there
and
if
memory
serves
me
correct,
chief
judge
haynesworth,
on
behalf
of
the
fourth
circuit
invited
the
state
of
north
carolina
to
reconsider
this
matter
in
light
of
peyton
against
rowe
and
what
it
held
with
respect
to
the
challenging
of
future
sentences.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
don't
really
think
we
do
have
a
dispute
with
him.
this
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
well
--
we're
forgetting
as
i
understand
that
the
question
of
some
immediate
impact
as
a
result
of
this
detainer
such
as
a
heavier
hand
and
so
forth.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
yes,
out
dispute
is
this
much.
he,
under
the
detainer
agreement
and
assuming
that
north
carolina
is
detainer
as
first
in
line
according
to
their
own
ways
of
resolving
this
and
so
forth.
at
the
expiration
of
his
current
valid
sentence,
the
warden
proposes
to
release
him
to
the
custody
of
north
carolina.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
one
of
the
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
no.
no.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
no,
ideally
i
would
like
to
have
the
warden
say
to
north
carolina
at
that
time,
i
have
been
ordered
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california
after
a
full
hearing
on
the
validity
of
your
conviction
to
refuse,
to
give
this
man
to
you.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
suppose
it
might
be
so,
i
think
the
district
court
has
the
unquestioned
power
to
fashion
an
order
which
is
directed
to
other
california
officials
to
decide.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
the
source
of
that
power
would
be
twofold.
first
of
all,
it
would
be
under
the
court's
obligation
to
consider
constitutional
challenges
that
have
been
raised
to
that
north
carolina
conviction.
and
secondly,
i
think
it’s
been
argued
in
the
briefs
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
in
california
over
the
state
of
north
carolina.
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
circumstances
of
this
detainer
agreement,
i
find
that
difficult
proposition
to
understand.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
no,
we
have
not
except
to
the
extent
that
the
ninth
circuit
below
held
that
it's
a
matter
of
law,
warden
nelson
is
the
agent
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
actually,
nothing
has
been
served
on
warden
nelson
because
of
course
habeas
corpus
is
a
little
bit
different
than
the
usual
plaintiff
defendant
case.
the
process
is
in
order
emanating
from
the
district
court
calling
upon
the
respondent
to
respond
and
show
cause
with
respect
to
the
conviction
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
--
that
have
never
gotten
that
far.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
no
we
have
pointed
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
--
under
the
detainer
agreement,
he
is
united
states
agent
for
the
enforcement
of
its
rights
under
the
detainer
agreement,
the
rights
as
they
now
stand.
in
part,
what
respondent
wishes
to
challenge
is
a
violation
by
north
carolina
of
the
very
provisions
of
that
detainer
agreement
under
which
he
was
tried.
to
wit,
the
fact
that
he
was
not
tried
within
the
mandatory
time
limit
of
that
detainer
agreement
and
therefore
i
suppose
our
position
on
the
merits
if
we're
allowed
to
get
to
that
would
be
that
north
carolina
simply
lost
the
limited
jurisdiction
over
him
that
he
has
acquired
under
the
detainer
agreement.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
suppose
mr.
justice
marshall
that
we
would
have
to.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
it
has
to
be.
the
problem
of
course
is
that
that
may
be
many
years
in
coming
and
this
is
why
i
returned
again
and
again
to
peyton
v.
rowe.
it
is
quite
true
that
respondent
has
alleged
some
present
impact
of
the
detainer
on
him
while
he
is
on
california
now.
now
perhaps
there
isn't
any
or
perhaps
it
can
be
ameliorated
but
primarily
he
is
in
--
he
is
desirous
of
having
a
hearing
on
the
claims
that
he
makes
with
respect
to
the
north
carolina
judgment
at
the
time
when
those
when
that
hearing
can
be
meaningful
and
not.
he
is
presently
serving
a
sentence
of
an
indeterminate
sentence
of
five
years
to
life,
and
so
he
faces
the
same
problem
with
respect
to
his
second
sentence
that
petitioner
rowe
faced
in
peyton
against
rowe.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
that's
probably
true
and
he
--
excuse
me,
he
did
test
it
by
way
of
direct
appeal.
now
we're
into
the
matter
of
a
collateral
attack
on
that
conviction
but
if
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
he
makes
three
mr.
justice
black.
the
first
is
that
the
detainer
agreement
by
its
terms
requires
that
if
a
man
be
taken
to
north
carolina
to
stand
trial
that
he
must
be
tried
within,
i
believe
a
120-day
period
and
if
he
is
not,
the
underlying
charge
shall
be
dismissed,
he
was
not
tried
within
this
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
no,
no,
no,
no.
once
he
request
to
be
taken
to
north
carolina
and
is
physically
taken
there
to
stand
trial
then
the
state
of
north
carolina
or
any
other
party
to
this
compact
has
a
limited
period
of
time
in
which
to
try
him
and
indeed
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
yes,
he
was.
yes,
he
was
in
san
quentin
prison.
north
carolina
filed
a
detainer
on
an
untried
charge
and
mr.
george
was
notified
of
this
charge
and
he
has
some
rights
under
the
detainer
agreement.
the
detainer
agreement
is
essentially
an
attempt
to
improve
the
speedy
trial
guaranteed
in
these
types
of
situations
where
a
man
is
incarcerated
for
many
years.
you've
dealt
with
some
of
these
problems
last
term
in
smith
against
hooey.
he
is
entitled
and
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
yes
he
was
taken
to
north
carolina.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
at
that
time
and
tried
and
convicted
and
immediately
returned
to
california,
so
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
the
fact
that
he
was
not
tried
within
the
time
limit
that
is
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
it
took
longer
than
the
mandatory
time
provision
of
the
detainer
agreement.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
detainer
agreement
provides
for
120
days
after
he
arrives
in
north
carolina.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
no,
well
yes,
north
carolina
law
to
the
extent
that
that
is
represented
by
this
detainer
compact
which
has
been
signed
by
a
number
of
states
and
the
provisions
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
yes,
yes
he
has.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
on
their
law.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
the
second
question
would
be
not
withstanding
the
violation
of
the
--
the
precise
violation
of
this
time
period.
it
may
be
that
the
delay
represents
if
the
denial
of
a
speedy
trial
under
the
sixth
amendment
and
his
third
claim
is
that
he
was
convicted
on
the
basis
of
testimony
known
by
the
prosecution
to
be
perjurious.
those
are
his
three
contentions.
they
may
all
be
without
merit
but
we've
never
had
a
hearing
on
that
and
we'd
like
to
have
one.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
under
ahrens
v.
clark
that's
--
at
this
time
that's
the
only
place
we
cant
try
it
and
we
all
have
some
difficulty
trying
it
there
but
we'll
have
a
lot
more
difficulty
if
we
have
to
go
back
to
north
carolina
and
try
it
10
years
from
now
or
20
years
from
now
or
30
years
from
now,
it
would
be
impossible.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
believe
that
to
be
the
law
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
that's
quite
correct.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
it
may
very
well
be
premature,
i'm
not
frankly
--
we
were
associated
in
this
case
when
it
was
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
we're
perhaps
a
little
bit
less
--
it
might
be
with
the
arguments
that
we
would
make
if
we
had
some
basis
to
get
into
the
district
court
in
this
instance.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
don't
think
so
because
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
we
are
also
concerned
not
with
the
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
that's
correct.
i
think
that
the
proceeding
ought
not
to
be
vacated
for
this
reason.
we're
not
only
concerned
with
such
present
effects
as
there
may
be
that
is
holding
him
with
a
heavier
hand,
the
things
that
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
discussed
just
a
few
moments
ago.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
we're
also
concerned
with
challenging
the
validity
of
the
north
carolina
on
the
merits.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
believe
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
that's
correct
but
i
believe
that
there
is
no
such
remedy.
as
it
was
raised
--
as
i
mentioned
in
word
against
north
carolina,
as
i
recall,
the
law
there
in
north
carolina
was
that
you
have
to
be
physically
in
custody
in
north
carolina.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
the
fourth
circuit
enlightened
north
carolina
to
reconsider
that
matter.
although,
i
have
trouble
with
that
because
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
remedies
available
at
the
time
the
petition
was
filed.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
so
far
as
i
know
they
have
not
modified
their
law
under
the
suggestion
of
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
suppose
that
we
would
have
to
apply
to
the
--
an
appropriate
court
that
no
one
else
in
california
assist.
in
other
words,
as
i
understand
your
question,
you're
asking
me,
if
what
would
we
do
if
the
warden
gave
us
voluntarily
the
sort
of
relief
that
we’re
seeking
in
the
district
court?
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
suppose
we
would
have
to
as
i
said
apply
to
an
appropriate
court
to
prevent
anyone
from
california
in
assisting
north
carolina
and
retaining
custody
or
north
carolina
can't
simply
come
and
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
we
couldn't
prevent
notification
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
no,
we
couldn't
prevent
that.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
no,
that's
entirely
correct.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
this
case,
in
extradition,
he
at
least
has
some
basis
to
appeal
to
the
executive
of
the
state
of
california
for
consideration.
extradition
habeas
corpus
may
be
limited,
an
extradition
proceeding
may
be
a
very
short
one
but
he
has
some
basis
to
appeal
to
someone
to
give
some
consideration
to
his
claim
that
the
north
carolina
sentence
is
invalid.
at
the
present
he
has
none
because
he's
waived
extradition.
under
the
detainer
agreement,
he's
waived
extradition
by
requesting
to
go
there
and
stand
trial.
he's
going
there,
he
stood
trial
and
in
the
interim
he's
asking
them
to
respond
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
that's
right,
that’s
entirely
correct.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
if
it
waives?
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
well
then,
i
suppose
he
doesn’t
go
to
north
carolina
to
serve
that
sentence.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
that's
right,
they
would
have
to
go
through
traditional
extradition
proceedings,
but
as
i
say,
at
least
at
that
point
he
would
have
some
recourse.
it
might
not
be
as
greater
recourse
as
in
habeas
corpus
at
present
time
but
at
least
some
recourse
in
which
he
could
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
executive
or
perhaps
the
court
under
the
extradition
habeas
corpus
his
charges.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
is
exercising
--
is
going
to
be
exercising
a
matter
of
futility.
i
think
that
there's
an
ample
basis
to
hold
on
to
hold
on
this
detainer
agreement
and
the
responsibilities
which
the
party
states
undertake
for
each
other
to
hold
that
north
carolina
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
in
california.
it
has
come
to
california
once
to
pick
him
up,
take
him
back
there,
try
him;
it
will
presumably
come
there
again
to
pick
him
up.
take
him
back
without
extradition
or
any
judicial
or
executive
inquiry
into
the
propriety
of
that.
all
he's
asking
is
that
they
come
out
here
in
the
interim
and
answer
to
his
charges
that
the
proceedings
which
were
handled
in
north
carolina
violated
his
constitutional
rights.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
does.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
we're
required
to
sue
the
warden
because
he
is
the
present
custodian.
if
we
sued
the
state
of
north
carolina,
as
indeed
we
did
in
the
first
instance,
the
first
petition
which
incidentally
is
not
printed
in
the
appendix
because
except
for
the
caption
that
is
identical
to
the
amended
petition
was
caption
john
edward
george
versus
the
state
of
north
carolina.
now
if
he
filed
that
petition
in
the
federal
court
in
san
francisco,
it
might
very
well
be
that
the
court
would
hold.
that
it
had
jurisdiction
over
the
named
respondent
to
witness
state
of
north
carolina.
it
strikes
me
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
at
that
point
to
name
the
warden
the
traditional
respondent
in
north
carolina
because
obviously
he
is
not
in
jail,
but
i
think
that
there
would
be
relief
available.
our
naming
of
lewis
nelson
is
because
of
his
obligations
under
the
detainer
agreement.
if
he
had
no
obligations
under
the
detainer
agreement,
i
do
not
believe
that
we
would
be
without
remedy
in
california.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
might
it
please
the
court.
i'm
george
cumming
of
san
francisco,
counsel
for
respondent,
john
edward
george.
i
think
having
in
mind
the
considerations
which
led
this
court
to
its
unanimous
decision
in
peyton
v.
rowe
two
terms
ago,
we're
here
today
to
consider
whether
or
not
respondent
george
is
entitled
to
a
timely
and
therefore
meaningful
hearing
on
the
constitutional
claims
that
he
makes
with
respect
to
the
north
carolina
conviction.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
no
i'm
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
a
difference
obviously
peyton
v.
rowe
dealt
with
prisoner
facing
consecutive
sentences
imposed
by
one
state.
this
involves
two
states.
i
would
say
at
the
outset
however
that
this
distinction
has
been
presented
before
courts
of
appeal
and
in
that
number
i
think
some
16
judges
and
none
of
those
16
who
considered
the
matter
here
before
have
considered
that
to
be
a
meaningful
distinction
between
peyton
and
this
case.
particularly
with
regard
to
peyton's
discussion
and
basis
of
the
desirability
and
indeed
perhaps
the
necessity
of
an
early
hearing
on
these
claims,
lest
records,
witnesses
and
evidence
be
washed
by
the
passage
of
time.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
and
he
is
presently
confined
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
in
the
northern
district
of
california.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
that's
correct,
that's
i
suppose
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
he
is
presently
confined
along
the
lines
of
peyton
v.
rowe.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
think
independent
of
a
--
we
have
to
go
back
in
time
in
this
case
a
little
bit.
california
and
north
carolina
are
parties
to
the
detainer
grade,
pursuant
to
that
agreement,
north
carolina
obtained
temporary
custody
of
respondent
in
order
to
try
him.
the
process
for
trying
him
absent
while
he
was
serving
a
california
sentence,
absent
this
detainer
agreement,
i'm
not
sure.
it
seems
to
me
that
some
of
the
problems
in
this
respect
were
canvassed
by
the
court’s
decision
last
term
in
smith
v.
hooey.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
that's
correct,
the
respondent's
application
under
this
detainer
agreement
to
be
released
in
north
carolina
for
trial
is
deemed
to
be
a
labor
of
extradition
by
him.
both
to
go
to
north
carolina
to
be
tried
and
to
return
to
north
carolina
to
serve
any
sentence
there
imposed.
the
detainer
agreement
states
that
specifically,
i
believe
its
article
iii
(e).
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
believe
that
it
could,
under
the
detainer
agreement.
the
agreement
states
that
the
warden
in
this
case
california
has
a
lawful
and
mandatory
duty
to
give
over
the
person
of
any
prisoner
whenever
required
by
the
detainer
agreement.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
yes.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
suppose
if
north
carolina
did
not
show
up
having
previously
been
notified,
this
apparently
there
is
an
administrative
provision
for
the
notification
in
advance
of
the
expiration
and
if
they
didn’t
show
up
then
inquiries
failed
to
discover
why.
i
suppose
he
could
with
impunity
at
that
point
discharge
the
prisoner.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
certainly
would,
there
would
be
at
that
point
nothing,
no
authority
i
would
think
for
the
warden
to
hold
it.
i
suppose
from
the
detainer
agreement
you
could
probably
infer
some
sort
of
authority
for
a
short
time
to
accommodate
the
agents
of
north
carolina
to
make
the
trip
to
california
and
pick
him
up.
perhaps,
it
would
require
that
they
show
up
on
a
release
day
so
as
to
take
him
into
their
own
custody
immediately
as
he
pass
through
the
gate
of
san
quentin.
i'm
not
sure
so
that
there
is
come
down
perhaps
to
a
split
second.
in
any
event,
this
case
involves
a
situation
where
at
least
on
the
record
thus
far
and
on
the
detainer
agreement,
the
warden
is
bound
to
give
respondent
over
to
north
carolina
upon
the
completion
of
his
valid
sentence
in
california.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
if
kansas
has
a
detainer
outstanding
at
this
time
on
an
untried
charge,
that
detainer
may
or
may
not
be
in
existence
at
the
time
that
respondent
is
released
from
california
custody
because
petitioner
has
no
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
petitioners
suggest
that
they
honor
the
matters
on
a
basis
of
that
detainer
first
received
and
i
guess
the
kansas
detainer
was
first
received.
he
would
honor
that
one
first
and
release
the
petitioner
to
kansas.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
suppose
it
is
in
this
sense
that
if
we
remain
in
the
situation
where
the
--
whereas
the
warden’s
discretion
as
to
what
to
do
about
these
detainers
that
is
if
we
stay
out
of
court
as
the
warden
urges
that
we
ought
to
do.
then
we
are
in
a
difficult
situation
but
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
would
like
to
get
this
matter
on
for
hearing
in
the
district
court
to
find
out
the
validity
of
this
north
carolina
sentence
and
then
approach
the
district
court
for
an
appropriate
or
to
deal
with
this
complicated
problems.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
that
was
at
his
request
under
the
detainer
agreement.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
yes,
he
does.
he
wants
to
attack
it,
may
i
say
at
a
time
which
he
feels
that
his
attack
can
be
meaningful.
that
is
of
the
time
when
the
evidence
and
the
witnesses
and
so
forth
may
be
available
to
him.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
this
obviously
presents
a
problem
to
him.
this
relates
to
the
second
question
that
the
petitioner
suggests
has
posed
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
appropriate
form.
under
ahrens
against
clark
however,
if
there
is
any
relief
available
to
him.
it
is
only
in
the
district
court
he
is
now
confined.
now
if
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
that
is
so,
he
is
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
am
not
familiar
with
that.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
might
very
well.
i
am
familiar
however
with
the
decision
in
word
against
north
carolina
which
happen
to
involve
the
same
state.
and
as
i
recall
that
decision,
they
suggested
that
post-conviction
relief
was
not
available
in
north
carolina
unless
the
petitioner
was
physically
incarcerated
there
and
if
memory
serves
me
correct,
chief
judge
haynesworth,
on
behalf
of
the
fourth
circuit
invited
the
state
of
north
carolina
to
reconsider
this
matter
in
light
of
peyton
against
rowe
and
what
it
held
with
respect
to
the
challenging
of
future
sentences.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
don't
really
think
we
do
have
a
dispute
with
him.
this
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
well
--
we're
forgetting
as
i
understand
that
the
question
of
some
immediate
impact
as
a
result
of
this
detainer
such
as
a
heavier
hand
and
so
forth.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
yes,
out
dispute
is
this
much.
he,
under
the
detainer
agreement
and
assuming
that
north
carolina
is
detainer
as
first
in
line
according
to
their
own
ways
of
resolving
this
and
so
forth.
at
the
expiration
of
his
current
valid
sentence,
the
warden
proposes
to
release
him
to
the
custody
of
north
carolina.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
one
of
the
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
no.
no.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
no,
ideally
i
would
like
to
have
the
warden
say
to
north
carolina
at
that
time,
i
have
been
ordered
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california
after
a
full
hearing
on
the
validity
of
your
conviction
to
refuse,
to
give
this
man
to
you.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
suppose
it
might
be
so,
i
think
the
district
court
has
the
unquestioned
power
to
fashion
an
order
which
is
directed
to
other
california
officials
to
decide.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
the
source
of
that
power
would
be
twofold.
first
of
all,
it
would
be
under
the
court's
obligation
to
consider
constitutional
challenges
that
have
been
raised
to
that
north
carolina
conviction.
and
secondly,
i
think
it’s
been
argued
in
the
briefs
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
in
california
over
the
state
of
north
carolina.
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
circumstances
of
this
detainer
agreement,
i
find
that
difficult
proposition
to
understand.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
no,
we
have
not
except
to
the
extent
that
the
ninth
circuit
below
held
that
it's
a
matter
of
law,
warden
nelson
is
the
agent
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
actually,
nothing
has
been
served
on
warden
nelson
because
of
course
habeas
corpus
is
a
little
bit
different
than
the
usual
plaintiff
defendant
case.
the
process
is
in
order
emanating
from
the
district
court
calling
upon
the
respondent
to
respond
and
show
cause
with
respect
to
the
conviction
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
--
that
have
never
gotten
that
far.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
no
we
have
pointed
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
--
under
the
detainer
agreement,
he
is
united
states
agent
for
the
enforcement
of
its
rights
under
the
detainer
agreement,
the
rights
as
they
now
stand.
in
part,
what
respondent
wishes
to
challenge
is
a
violation
by
north
carolina
of
the
very
provisions
of
that
detainer
agreement
under
which
he
was
tried.
to
wit,
the
fact
that
he
was
not
tried
within
the
mandatory
time
limit
of
that
detainer
agreement
and
therefore
i
suppose
our
position
on
the
merits
if
we're
allowed
to
get
to
that
would
be
that
north
carolina
simply
lost
the
limited
jurisdiction
over
him
that
he
has
acquired
under
the
detainer
agreement.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
suppose
mr.
justice
marshall
that
we
would
have
to.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
it
has
to
be.
the
problem
of
course
is
that
that
may
be
many
years
in
coming
and
this
is
why
i
returned
again
and
again
to
peyton
v.
rowe.
it
is
quite
true
that
respondent
has
alleged
some
present
impact
of
the
detainer
on
him
while
he
is
on
california
now.
now
perhaps
there
isn't
any
or
perhaps
it
can
be
ameliorated
but
primarily
he
is
in
--
he
is
desirous
of
having
a
hearing
on
the
claims
that
he
makes
with
respect
to
the
north
carolina
judgment
at
the
time
when
those
when
that
hearing
can
be
meaningful
and
not.
he
is
presently
serving
a
sentence
of
an
indeterminate
sentence
of
five
years
to
life,
and
so
he
faces
the
same
problem
with
respect
to
his
second
sentence
that
petitioner
rowe
faced
in
peyton
against
rowe.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
that's
probably
true
and
he
--
excuse
me,
he
did
test
it
by
way
of
direct
appeal.
now
we're
into
the
matter
of
a
collateral
attack
on
that
conviction
but
if
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
he
makes
three
mr.
justice
black.
the
first
is
that
the
detainer
agreement
by
its
terms
requires
that
if
a
man
be
taken
to
north
carolina
to
stand
trial
that
he
must
be
tried
within,
i
believe
a
120-day
period
and
if
he
is
not,
the
underlying
charge
shall
be
dismissed,
he
was
not
tried
within
this
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
no,
no,
no,
no.
once
he
request
to
be
taken
to
north
carolina
and
is
physically
taken
there
to
stand
trial
then
the
state
of
north
carolina
or
any
other
party
to
this
compact
has
a
limited
period
of
time
in
which
to
try
him
and
indeed
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
yes,
he
was.
yes,
he
was
in
san
quentin
prison.
north
carolina
filed
a
detainer
on
an
untried
charge
and
mr.
george
was
notified
of
this
charge
and
he
has
some
rights
under
the
detainer
agreement.
the
detainer
agreement
is
essentially
an
attempt
to
improve
the
speedy
trial
guaranteed
in
these
types
of
situations
where
a
man
is
incarcerated
for
many
years.
you've
dealt
with
some
of
these
problems
last
term
in
smith
against
hooey.
he
is
entitled
and
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
yes
he
was
taken
to
north
carolina.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
at
that
time
and
tried
and
convicted
and
immediately
returned
to
california,
so
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
the
fact
that
he
was
not
tried
within
the
time
limit
that
is
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
it
took
longer
than
the
mandatory
time
provision
of
the
detainer
agreement.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
detainer
agreement
provides
for
120
days
after
he
arrives
in
north
carolina.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
no,
well
yes,
north
carolina
law
to
the
extent
that
that
is
represented
by
this
detainer
compact
which
has
been
signed
by
a
number
of
states
and
the
provisions
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
yes,
yes
he
has.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
on
their
law.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
the
second
question
would
be
not
withstanding
the
violation
of
the
--
the
precise
violation
of
this
time
period.
it
may
be
that
the
delay
represents
if
the
denial
of
a
speedy
trial
under
the
sixth
amendment
and
his
third
claim
is
that
he
was
convicted
on
the
basis
of
testimony
known
by
the
prosecution
to
be
perjurious.
those
are
his
three
contentions.
they
may
all
be
without
merit
but
we've
never
had
a
hearing
on
that
and
we'd
like
to
have
one.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
under
ahrens
v.
clark
that's
--
at
this
time
that's
the
only
place
we
cant
try
it
and
we
all
have
some
difficulty
trying
it
there
but
we'll
have
a
lot
more
difficulty
if
we
have
to
go
back
to
north
carolina
and
try
it
10
years
from
now
or
20
years
from
now
or
30
years
from
now,
it
would
be
impossible.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
believe
that
to
be
the
law
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
that's
quite
correct.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
it
may
very
well
be
premature,
i'm
not
frankly
--
we
were
associated
in
this
case
when
it
was
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
we're
perhaps
a
little
bit
less
--
it
might
be
with
the
arguments
that
we
would
make
if
we
had
some
basis
to
get
into
the
district
court
in
this
instance.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
don't
think
so
because
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
we
are
also
concerned
not
with
the
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
that's
correct.
i
think
that
the
proceeding
ought
not
to
be
vacated
for
this
reason.
we're
not
only
concerned
with
such
present
effects
as
there
may
be
that
is
holding
him
with
a
heavier
hand,
the
things
that
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
discussed
just
a
few
moments
ago.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
we're
also
concerned
with
challenging
the
validity
of
the
north
carolina
on
the
merits.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
believe
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
that's
correct
but
i
believe
that
there
is
no
such
remedy.
as
it
was
raised
--
as
i
mentioned
in
word
against
north
carolina,
as
i
recall,
the
law
there
in
north
carolina
was
that
you
have
to
be
physically
in
custody
in
north
carolina.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
the
fourth
circuit
enlightened
north
carolina
to
reconsider
that
matter.
although,
i
have
trouble
with
that
because
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
remedies
available
at
the
time
the
petition
was
filed.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
so
far
as
i
know
they
have
not
modified
their
law
under
the
suggestion
of
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
suppose
that
we
would
have
to
apply
to
the
--
an
appropriate
court
that
no
one
else
in
california
assist.
in
other
words,
as
i
understand
your
question,
you're
asking
me,
if
what
would
we
do
if
the
warden
gave
us
voluntarily
the
sort
of
relief
that
we’re
seeking
in
the
district
court?
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
suppose
we
would
have
to
as
i
said
apply
to
an
appropriate
court
to
prevent
anyone
from
california
in
assisting
north
carolina
and
retaining
custody
or
north
carolina
can't
simply
come
and
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
we
couldn't
prevent
notification
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
no,
we
couldn't
prevent
that.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
no,
that's
entirely
correct.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
this
case,
in
extradition,
he
at
least
has
some
basis
to
appeal
to
the
executive
of
the
state
of
california
for
consideration.
extradition
habeas
corpus
may
be
limited,
an
extradition
proceeding
may
be
a
very
short
one
but
he
has
some
basis
to
appeal
to
someone
to
give
some
consideration
to
his
claim
that
the
north
carolina
sentence
is
invalid.
at
the
present
he
has
none
because
he's
waived
extradition.
under
the
detainer
agreement,
he's
waived
extradition
by
requesting
to
go
there
and
stand
trial.
he's
going
there,
he
stood
trial
and
in
the
interim
he's
asking
them
to
respond
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
that's
right,
that’s
entirely
correct.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
if
it
waives?
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
well
then,
i
suppose
he
doesn’t
go
to
north
carolina
to
serve
that
sentence.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
that's
right,
they
would
have
to
go
through
traditional
extradition
proceedings,
but
as
i
say,
at
least
at
that
point
he
would
have
some
recourse.
it
might
not
be
as
greater
recourse
as
in
habeas
corpus
at
present
time
but
at
least
some
recourse
in
which
he
could
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
executive
or
perhaps
the
court
under
the
extradition
habeas
corpus
his
charges.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
is
exercising
--
is
going
to
be
exercising
a
matter
of
futility.
i
think
that
there's
an
ample
basis
to
hold
on
to
hold
on
this
detainer
agreement
and
the
responsibilities
which
the
party
states
undertake
for
each
other
to
hold
that
north
carolina
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
in
california.
it
has
come
to
california
once
to
pick
him
up,
take
him
back
there,
try
him;
it
will
presumably
come
there
again
to
pick
him
up.
take
him
back
without
extradition
or
any
judicial
or
executive
inquiry
into
the
propriety
of
that.
all
he's
asking
is
that
they
come
out
here
in
the
interim
and
answer
to
his
charges
that
the
proceedings
which
were
handled
in
north
carolina
violated
his
constitutional
rights.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
does.
mr.
george
a.
cumming,
jr.
we're
required
to
sue
the
warden
because
he
is
the
present
custodian.
if
we
sued
the
state
of
north
carolina,
as
indeed
we
did
in
the
first
instance,
the
first
petition
which
incidentally
is
not
printed
in
the
appendix
because
except
for
the
caption
that
is
identical
to
the
amended
petition
was
caption
john
edward
george
versus
the
state
of
north
carolina.
now
if
he
filed
that
petition
in
the
federal
court
in
san
francisco,
it
might
very
well
be
that
the
court
would
hold.
that
it
had
jurisdiction
over
the
named
respondent
to
witness
state
of
north
carolina.
it
strikes
me
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
at
that
point
to
name
the
warden
the
traditional
respondent
in
north
carolina
because
obviously
he
is
not
in
jail,
but
i
think
that
there
would
be
relief
available.
our
naming
of
lewis
nelson
is
because
of
his
obligations
under
the
detainer
agreement.
if
he
had
no
obligations
under
the
detainer
agreement,
i
do
not
believe
that
we
would
be
without
remedy
in
california.
thank
you
very
much.
