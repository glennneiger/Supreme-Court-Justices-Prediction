ms.
louise
h.
renne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
filed
by
the
warden
of
the
california
state
prison
from
the
decision
rendered
by
the
united
states
courts
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
court
below
held
the
jurisdiction
existed
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california
to
entertain
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
filed
by
a
california
prisoner
serving
a
california
sentence
in
california
in
order
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
an
unrelated
north
carolina
conviction
held
that
the
california
warden
was
an
agent
for
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
a
proper
party
respondent
to
defend
the
action.
it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
the
question
raised
in
this
case
is
essentially
one
and
that
is
whether
habeas
corpus
relief
is
presently
available
to
a
california
prisoner
in
california
who
seeks
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
a
sentence
which
has
been
imposed
by
another
state.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
it
does
your
honor,
under
the
agreement
on
detainer
--
well,
i
have
to
answer
this
question
in
two
ways,
your
honor.
if
another
state
is
not
a
party
to
the
agreement
on
detainers,
then
in
order
for
that
prisoner
to
stand
trial
in
another
state
requires
an
executive
agreement
followed
by
extradition
proceedings.
clearly
in
this
case,
the
state
has
a
reserve
clause.
under
the
agreement
on
detainers,
a
prisoner
--
if
a
prisoner
invokes
the
agreement
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
the
state
of
california
is
required
to
send
that
prisoner
back
to
the
other
state.
if
however
that
it
is
the
other
state
that
initiates
proceedings,
there
is
a
reserve
clause
retained
by
the
governor
may
or
the
prisoner
may
disapprove
and
not
be
willing
to
go
to
the
other
state.
we
believe
your
honor
that
the
answer
to
the
first
question
we
have
raised
is
clearly
in
the
negative.
if
the
court
should
however
decide
that
habeas
corpus
really
is
presently
available,
then
there
is
another
question
which
is
raised
by
this
case
and
that
is,
what
is
the
appropriate
forum
in
which
to
bring
an
action
of
this
kind?
the
district
of
confinement
or
the
district
of
sentencing,
the
facts
of
this
case
are
that
the
petitioner
below,
john
edward
george
was
in
april
of
1964
convicted
upon
his
plea
of
guilty
to
first-degree
robbery
in
the
san
francisco
superior
court.
he
was
sentenced
to
state
prison
and
under
the
california
indeterminate
sentence
law
that
is
indeterminate
five
years
to
life
sentence.
following
his
conviction,
the
petitioner
was
confined
in
san
quentin
prison
and
detainers
were
placed
against
him
by
three
states.
the
state
of
kansas,
the
state
of
nevada,
and
the
state
of
north
carolina,
at
this
time
north
carolina
and
california
were
parties
to
the
agreement
on
detainers
which
as
i
have
indicated.
if
a
prisoner
seeks
to
stand
trial
in
another
party
state,
he
may
invoke
the
procedures
under
the
agreement
and
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
accordingly
in
march
of
1966,
george
was
temporarily
released
from
custody
in
california
to
stand
in
trial
in
north
carolina.
after
one
mistrial,
george
was
convicted
of
robbery
in
february
of
1967
in
the
north
carolina
state
courts.
a
sentence
of
12
years
to
15
years
was
imposed
and
as
george
alleged
below,
this
sentence
will
not
begin
to
run
until
he
is
in
north
carolina.
george
was
returned
to
california
in
february
of
1967
and
in
september
of
1967
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
affirmed
his
conviction.
in
december
of
1967
george
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california.
his
first
petition
was
captioned
john
edward
george
versus
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
the
district
judge
dismissed
the
petition
or
failure
to
name
proper
party
respondent.
thereafter,
george
re-captioned
his
petition
naming
the
warden
of
san
quentin
prison
as
an
agent
for
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
naming
the
warden
of
north
carolina
state
prison
name
unknown.
ultimately,
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california
dismissed
the
petition
on
the
basis
of
this
court’s
decision
in
mcnally
v.
hill
under
which
the
court
had
held
that
a
prisoner
must
be
confined
under
the
sentence
he
is
seeking
to
challenge
in
order
to
obtain
habeas
corpus
relief.
thereafter
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
to
appeal
was
granted
by
the
district
court
but
prior
to
the
opening
briefs
being
filed
in
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
this
court's
decision
in
peyton
v.
rowe
was
decided.
and
in
peyton
v.
rowe,
this
court
held
that
a
virginia
prisoner
could
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
a
consecutive
sentence
imposed
by
the
state
of
virginia.
on
the
basis
of
peyton
v.
rowe,
george
filed
a
motion
to
remand
the
proceedings
to
the
district
court.
we
were
given
notice
of
the
motion
and
as
our
first
appearance,
filed
in
opposition
to
the
motion
to
remand
and
move
to
dismiss
the
proceedings
on
the
grounds
that
peyton
v.
rowe
should
not
be
extended
to
the
interstate
case
that
the
california
warden
was
not
a
proper
party
respondent
in
this
habeas
corpus
action,
that
a
north
carolina
official
who
might
be
a
proper
party
respondent
was
not
before
the
court
service
of
process
had
not
been
obtained
and
couldn't
be
obtained
and
that
accordingly
the
district
court,
the
northern
district
of
california
was
without
jurisdiction
to
proceed.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes,
your
honor
from
--
we
have
been
--
although
it
is
not
in
the
record
we
have
been
in
contact
with
the
north
carolina
attorney
general's
office
since
the
interception
of
this
case.
but
their
position
is
although
it
is
not
a
matter
of
record
but
their
position
is
that
habeas
corpus
relief
is
not
presently
available
in
the
case
of
this
kind.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
is
correct
your
honor,
they
have
not
been
served
with
process,
we're
not
aware
of
any
way
in
which
they
could
be.
nevertheless,
the
court
below
disagreed.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
it
is
our
position
your
honor
that
we
don't
--
while
we
recognize
that
there
is
a
conviction
we
give
no
effect
to
it
and
so
that
habeas
corpus
relief
is
not
presently
available
in
any
court.
we
do
take
the
position
that
it
is
only
after
this
court
decides
which
we
strongly
urge
that
it
not
do
that
there
is
custody
within
the
meaning
of
the
habeas
corpus
statute
as
only
then
that
this
court
need
reach
the
question
of
what
is
the
appropriate
forum.
if
it
decides
that
custody
is
existent
in
this
case,
it's
only
then
that
it
need
decide
whether
it
is
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
the
prisoner
is
seeking
to
set
aside
north
carolina
conviction.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
it's
our
position
that
there
is
no
dispute,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
your
honor,
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
there
is
no
showing
in
this
record
that
his
parole
is
affected
by
the
north
carolina
conviction.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
what
he
said
in
the
court
below
was
that
the
fact
that
there
was
a
conviction
outstanding
assuredly
affected
his
parole.
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honor,
that
is
not
california
policy
and
we
have
submitted
a
policy
statement
of
the
adult
authority
in
the
court
below
where
there
is
a
conviction
outstanding
in
another
state.
particularly
where
that
state
happens
to
be
the
place
of
residence,
primary
place
of
residence
of
the
prisoner,
we
will
release
--
it
is
our
policy
not
frequently
invoked,
we
will
release
the
prisoner
on
parole
earlier
than
might
otherwise
be
the
case.
this
case
your
honor
this
is
our
policy.
it
is
not
like
peyton
v.
rowe
where
in
peyton
v.
rowe
you
had
consecutive
sentences
imposed
by
one
state
and
there
was
a
state
statute
which
said
that
the
concept
of
the
sentences
should
be
treated
as
one
for
purposes
of
parole
eligibility.
you
do
not
have
that
kind
of
statute
in
this
case
and
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no,
your
honor,
what
happened
after
we
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
what
happened,
your
honor,
we
were
not
given
notice
of
the
proceedings
until
the
ninth
circuit.
we
filed
an
opposition
to
the
motion
to
remand
stating
that
this
only
sentence
that
this
man
was
serving
was
a
california
sentence.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
because
that
what
the
--
in
order
for
habeas
corpus
relief
to
be
available,
he
must
be
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
sentences
seeking
the
challenge.
california
sentence
was
imposed
in
1964,
service
of
that
sentence
makes
no
difference
whether
he
was
acquitted
later
in
north
carolina
or
not.
whether
or
not
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
i
don't
think
he
could,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
because
the
--
i
don't
know
what
his
theory
of
action
could
be
if
what
he
is
challenging
is
the
reasonableness
of
prison
policy
in
considering
any
charge
or
even
a
past
conviction
in
determining
whether
or
not
he
is
more
likely
prisoner
to
escape.
then
what
he
would
be
challenging
is
the
reasonableness
of
prison
policy
but
as
yet
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
parole.
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
one
level
of
confinement
rather
than
another,
and
in
any
event
what
you
are
talking
about
in
that
case
is
the
reasonableness
of
prison
policy.
if
we
are
going
to
get
into
questions
about
whether
or
not
the
california
imprisoning
authorities
can
consider
the
fact
that
a
man’s
been
convicted
in
other
state
in
determining
to
whether
or
not
he's
eligible
for
minimum
custody.
then
your
honor
we
respectfully
submit
that
you're
going
to
also
have
to
face
the
question
that
the
past
conviction
situation
because
if
the
prison
authorities
consider
past
convictions
fully
served
in
determining
whether
the
man's
more
likely
to
escape
or
whether
his
eligible
for
minimum
custody.
then
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
the
business
of
the
court
is
going
to
be
substantially
expanded.
we
think
that
there
is
a
decided
difference
between
where
you
have
sentences
lumped
together
by
one
state
and
where
you’re
talking
about
sentences
imposed
by
another
state.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes,
your
honor.
what
we
would
like
to
make
perfectly
clear
that
this
case
isn't
like
a
case
where
california
has
used
the
conviction
of
another
state
as
a
prior
conviction
increased
the
length
of
confinement
or
to
render
habitual
criminal
status
available.
that's
not
this
case
at
all.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
california
is
itself
clear
your
honor
that
where
the
state
is
attempting
to
increase
the
length
of
statutory
service.
then
in
california,
he
may
challenge
the
out
of
state
conviction.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
it's
a
burden
of
proof
on
the
state,
your
honor
but
in
that
case
your
honor,
california
is
attempting
to
use
the
conviction
for
their
own
purposes
but
we’re
not
attempting
to
use
the
sentences
of
north
carolina
for
any
purpose
at
all.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that's
part
of
the
problem
your
honor,
that's
part
of
the
problem
but
most
importantly
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
most
importantly
your
honor,
we
are
saying
that
section
2241
(c)
3
of
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute
provides
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
shall
not
extend
to
a
prisoner
unless
he
is
in
custody
in
violation
of
a
constitution.
he
is
in
custody
under
the
california
sentence.
he
is
not
challenging
that
sentence.
that
is
why
we
say
that
custody
under
the
habeas
corpus
statute
is
lacking.
we
think
that
the
lack
of
custody
is
particularly
emphasized
by
the
courts
holding
below
that
we
are
the
agents
for
north
carolina.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
your
honor
the
record
doesn't
show
it.
the
facts
are
that
this
man
was
given
a
parole
date
an
earlier
parole
date
but
there
were
--
there
was
a
subsequent
occurrence.
it's
a
matter
of
dispute,
the
state
says
one
thing,
the
prisoner
says
another
but
there
was
another
occurrence
in
which
his
parole
date
was
cancelled.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
our
position
is
your
honor
that
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
prisoner
for
anything
connected
with
a
california
sentence
but
mr.
george
has
never
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
california
sentence.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no,
it's
our
position
your
honor
that
at
this
--
excuse
me,
challenge
a
california
sentence
in
north
carolina?
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
he
has
not
attempted
to
exhaust
his
state
remedies
in
north
carolina.
now,
two
of
the
issues
that
he
has
raised
in
his
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
california
court
have
already
been
determined
by
the
north
carolina
supreme
court.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no,
no
and
although
we
think
that
certainly
since
he
has
never
made
any
attempt
to
have
his
third
issue
determined
by
the
north
carolina
supreme
court.
in
his
petition
below,
he
first
alleged
that
the
north
carolina
sentence
was
imposed
outside
the
time
limits
provided
by
the
agreement
on
detainers
so
that
the
north
carolina
court
was
without
jurisdiction
to
proceed
and
that
this
was
a
deprivation
of
due
process.
his
second
ground
was
that
it's
all
related
to
right
to
speedy
trial.
these
were
the
two
issues
that
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
determined.
it
was
in
his
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
california
court
that
he
made
the
determination,
raised
the
issue
of
knowing
you
supported
your
testimony.
we
think
that
the
practical
difficulties
of
the
court's
decision
below
do
emphasize
the
lack
of
custody.
the
court
has
held
that
california
is
an
agent
for
north
carolina
but
as
respectfully
submitted
your
honor,
the
agency
connotes
some
sort
of
voluntary
acceptance
of
authority
and
we
have
never
assented
to
defending
a
north
carolina
conviction.
we
are
unwilling
to
do
so.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
the
court
of
appeals
has
never
said
exactly
what
our
obligation
was
your
honor,
i
suppose
that’s
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
certainly
honoring
of
the
detainer
is
a
question
solely
of
comity
your
honor.
we
don't
have
to
honor
a
detainer
but
even
if
we
didn't
give
affect
to
the
detainer,
there's
a
very
interesting
factual
situation
in
this
case
and
that
is
that
the
state
of
kansas
still
has
a
detainer
filed
against
this
man
and
the
state
of
north
carolina
knows
that.
when
and
if
this
man
is
released,
he
could
be
released
to
stand
trial
in
kansas.
as
far
as
we
know,
there's
nothing
to
preclude
the
state
of
north
carolina
than
going
to
kansas.
but
we
understand
to
and
have
their
detainer
honor
there.
or
if
that
result
would
be
the
result
that
we
didn't
honor
the
detainer,
what
the
court
is
actually
would
be
asking
us
to
do
too
is
to
giving
a
greater
right
to
a
detainer
than
we
can
give.
or
to
review
a
conviction
in
which
we
can
give
in
an
extradition
proceeding.
where
an
extradition
warrant
or
extradition
proceedings
are
instituted
in
the
california
courts.
we
can't
look
at
the
underlying
reasons
walk
through
that
extradition
warrant.
it
could
be
we
disagree
but
we
can't
do
that
under
law,
we
can't
look
at
the
underlying
facts
and
the
court
below
said
that
we
could
call
upon
the
north
carolina
officials
but
were
not
so
sure
that
they
would
be
willing
to
come
out.
number
one
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
as
i
suggest
your
honor
but
if
a
man
goes
into
another
state
in
north
carolina
possibly
to
get
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
as
i
say
your
honor,
detainer
honoring
a
detainer
solely
a
matter
of
comity
but
it
could
be
that
north
carolina
wouldn’t
have
a
detainer.
also
a
detainer
is
a
request
to
be
notified
of
a
man's
release.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
we
could
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
i
think
it's
a
very
serious
problem
your
honor,
what
the
court
below
has
asked
the
states
literally
to
fight
among
themselves
and
the
practical
problems
of
transporting
records
and
witnesses
across
country
even
assuming
you
could
get
the
witnesses.
for
example
if
the
deputy
district
attorney
who
tried
this
case
below
is
no
longer
in
the
north
carolina
state
government,
then
we
don’t
know
how
north
carolina
could
get
that
deputy
district
attorney
in
a
california
court
if
that
deputy
district
attorney
was
unwilling.
from
the
prisoner’s
point
of
view,
this
result
is
untenable.
he
is
asking
a
california
judge
to
review
a
north
carolina
conviction
the
california
judge
can't
be
familiar
with
north
carolina
procedure.
a
california
council
no
matter
how
competent
can't
know
where
to
look
for
the
records,
can't
know
what
witnesses
to
call,
can't
get
the
witnesses
as
even
before
the
california
court.
we've
not
suggested
that
there's
another
form
available
because
under
this
court's
decision
in
ahrens
v.
clark
and
under
the
traditional
rules
of
habeas
corpus.
you
must
bring
your
petition
if
at
all
in
the
district
of
confinement
but
we
think
bringing
the
suit
in
the
district
of
sentencing
has
tremendous
practical
problems
too.
you
have
problems
of
escape,
you
have
the
problems
of
the
confining
state,
might
be
unwilling
to
have
that
prisoner
go
to
the
other
state.
you
have
the
expense
problems
and
there
are
no
funds
that
we're
aware
of
to
provide
for
the
transportation
of
the
prisoner
or
its
counsel
across
the
country.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
your
honor
if
i
may
briefly
respond
to
two
primary
points.
mr.
justice
brennan
raised
the
question
of
my
representation
to
the
court.
this
is
not
a
case
and
it
is
our
representation
that
this
is
not
a
case
or
california
has
attempted
to
use
north
carolina
conviction
to
increase
the
length
of
the
california
sentence
or
to
classify
the
defendant
as
a
criminal.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no,
that
is
not
alleged.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
as
i
understand
there
is
some
allegation
that
might
affect
his
parole
consideration.
that
kind
of
allegation
was
made
below
but
that's
a
totally
different
question.
the
record
doesn't
support
and
in
fact
we
don't
think
the
record
will
support
it.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
oh!
yes,
that's
true
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
because
your
honor,
it's
--
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
presupposes
and
the
applicability
of
present
habeas
corpus
relief.
the
issue
raised
in
the
court
below
was,
is
there
presently
available
habeas
corpus
relief
and
it
is
our
position
that
is
not.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
we
do
think
in
this
instance
your
honor
that
there
hasn't
been
any
showing
of
an
attempt
to
exhaustion
but
that
is
correct.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
because
that
presupposes
that
if
there
is
some
sort
of
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
of
california,
your
honor
and
we're
unwilling,
we
don’t
believe
that
that’s
the
correct
law.
we
think
that
it
may
be
that
this
inmate
has
a
remedy
in
a
north
carolina
courts.
if
what
he
is
after
is
to
challenge
his
north
carolina
conviction
he
ought
to
attempt
to
seek
relief
in
the
north
carolina
state
courts.
that's
our
position
and
we
think
that
there's
been
no
showing
that
hes
attempted
to
do
that.
but
we
don't
think
there
is
presently
available
federal
habeas
corpus
relief.
i'd
like
to
make
clear
too
in
response
to
some
of
the
other
questions
that
were
asked
that
on
the
strike,
we
will
not
hold
a
man
one
day
longer
on
the
strength
of
a
detainer.
if
a
man's
conviction
has
expired,
a
responding
state
must
come
into
california
to
seek
and
obtain
an
extradition
warrant.
the
prisoner
can
waive
extradition
and
that's
a
different
matter.
but
if
hasn't,
we
will
release
a
man
only
pursuant
to
extradition.
in
the
parole
situation,
there
are
two
separate
ways
that
a
man
might
be
paroled.
if
the
adult
authority
which
is
our
paroling
agency
in
california
believes
this
man
has
totally
satisfied
--
is
sought
ready
for
parole,
we
will
release
the
man
subject
to
hold
which
means
that
we
will
notify
the
other
state
and
the
other
state
has
to
come
in
with
an
extradition
in
warrant.
if
we
don't
believe
the
man
is
ready
yet
for
parole
but
nevertheless
we
know
he
has
a
conviction
or
a
charge
in
another
state
and
it's
quite
clear
that
the
others
seem
to
be
clear
that
the
other
state
wishes
to
obtain
custody
which
they
can
do
under
extradition,
we
may
put
it
as
a
special
condition
of
parole
that
is
the
protocol.
now,
that
other
state
doesn't
come
in
with
extradition
warrant
or
the
prisoner
doesn't
waive
extradition,
then
we
may
reconsider
whether
the
man
ought
to
be
on
parole.
but
that's
reconsideration
under
the
california
sentence
only.
we
respectfully
submit
that
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
your
honor
as
i
recall
section
1404
(a),
that
statute
--
transfers
statute
says
that
the
case
may
be
transferred
to
an
action
where
it
might
have
been
brought.
it
is
our
position
that
this
case
could
not
have
been
brought
in
another
forum.
now,
it
is
true
word
v.
north
carolina,
the
fourth
circuit
opinion
decided
that
the
sentencing
court
wasn’t
appropriate
for
him
in
a
case
of
this
kind.
but
it's
really
fortuitous
that
in
both
cases
north
carolina
conviction
should
be
involved.
in
any
other
circuit
this
wouldn't
be
the
case,
the
other
reason
case
being
the
third
circuit
case
and
then
scoten
versus
pennsylvania
where
the
third
circuit
held
that
new
jersey
prisoners
couldn’t
challenge
future
pennsylvania
sentences
in
a
pennsylvania
court.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
i
have
read
it,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
in
the
face
of
it,
your
honor.
that
does
seem
to
be
the
case
but
it
might
be
that
in
view
that
the
north
carolina
legislature
would
be
wiling
to
change
his
mind.
it
might
be
that
if
the
proper
case
ever
rose
on
north
carolina
that
there
would
be
some
sort
of
reading
of
the
north
carolina
statute
to
encompass
a
case
of
this
kind.
there's
never
been
that
kind
of
attempt
we’re
aware
of.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
it
is
a
kind
--
excuse
me.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
it
is
a
kind
of
exhaustion
your
honor
as
we
said
--
as
i
understand
exhaustion
in
the
technical
sense.
it
does
presuppose
some
sort
of
present
habeas
corpus
sought
relief.
where
unwilling,
we
don't
think
the
law
requires
that.
we
do
think
as
far
as
the
equities
of
the
situation
are
concerned
that
the
prisoner
ought
to
make
an
attempt
in
north
carolina
to
get
some
sort
of
relief
there.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
filed
by
the
warden
of
the
california
state
prison
from
the
decision
rendered
by
the
united
states
courts
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
court
below
held
the
jurisdiction
existed
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california
to
entertain
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
filed
by
a
california
prisoner
serving
a
california
sentence
in
california
in
order
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
an
unrelated
north
carolina
conviction
held
that
the
california
warden
was
an
agent
for
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
a
proper
party
respondent
to
defend
the
action.
it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
the
question
raised
in
this
case
is
essentially
one
and
that
is
whether
habeas
corpus
relief
is
presently
available
to
a
california
prisoner
in
california
who
seeks
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
a
sentence
which
has
been
imposed
by
another
state.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
it
does
your
honor,
under
the
agreement
on
detainer
--
well,
i
have
to
answer
this
question
in
two
ways,
your
honor.
if
another
state
is
not
a
party
to
the
agreement
on
detainers,
then
in
order
for
that
prisoner
to
stand
trial
in
another
state
requires
an
executive
agreement
followed
by
extradition
proceedings.
clearly
in
this
case,
the
state
has
a
reserve
clause.
under
the
agreement
on
detainers,
a
prisoner
--
if
a
prisoner
invokes
the
agreement
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
the
state
of
california
is
required
to
send
that
prisoner
back
to
the
other
state.
if
however
that
it
is
the
other
state
that
initiates
proceedings,
there
is
a
reserve
clause
retained
by
the
governor
may
or
the
prisoner
may
disapprove
and
not
be
willing
to
go
to
the
other
state.
we
believe
your
honor
that
the
answer
to
the
first
question
we
have
raised
is
clearly
in
the
negative.
if
the
court
should
however
decide
that
habeas
corpus
really
is
presently
available,
then
there
is
another
question
which
is
raised
by
this
case
and
that
is,
what
is
the
appropriate
forum
in
which
to
bring
an
action
of
this
kind?
the
district
of
confinement
or
the
district
of
sentencing,
the
facts
of
this
case
are
that
the
petitioner
below,
john
edward
george
was
in
april
of
1964
convicted
upon
his
plea
of
guilty
to
first-degree
robbery
in
the
san
francisco
superior
court.
he
was
sentenced
to
state
prison
and
under
the
california
indeterminate
sentence
law
that
is
indeterminate
five
years
to
life
sentence.
following
his
conviction,
the
petitioner
was
confined
in
san
quentin
prison
and
detainers
were
placed
against
him
by
three
states.
the
state
of
kansas,
the
state
of
nevada,
and
the
state
of
north
carolina,
at
this
time
north
carolina
and
california
were
parties
to
the
agreement
on
detainers
which
as
i
have
indicated.
if
a
prisoner
seeks
to
stand
trial
in
another
party
state,
he
may
invoke
the
procedures
under
the
agreement
and
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
accordingly
in
march
of
1966,
george
was
temporarily
released
from
custody
in
california
to
stand
in
trial
in
north
carolina.
after
one
mistrial,
george
was
convicted
of
robbery
in
february
of
1967
in
the
north
carolina
state
courts.
a
sentence
of
12
years
to
15
years
was
imposed
and
as
george
alleged
below,
this
sentence
will
not
begin
to
run
until
he
is
in
north
carolina.
george
was
returned
to
california
in
february
of
1967
and
in
september
of
1967
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
affirmed
his
conviction.
in
december
of
1967
george
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california.
his
first
petition
was
captioned
john
edward
george
versus
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
the
district
judge
dismissed
the
petition
or
failure
to
name
proper
party
respondent.
thereafter,
george
re-captioned
his
petition
naming
the
warden
of
san
quentin
prison
as
an
agent
for
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
naming
the
warden
of
north
carolina
state
prison
name
unknown.
ultimately,
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california
dismissed
the
petition
on
the
basis
of
this
court’s
decision
in
mcnally
v.
hill
under
which
the
court
had
held
that
a
prisoner
must
be
confined
under
the
sentence
he
is
seeking
to
challenge
in
order
to
obtain
habeas
corpus
relief.
thereafter
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
to
appeal
was
granted
by
the
district
court
but
prior
to
the
opening
briefs
being
filed
in
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
this
court's
decision
in
peyton
v.
rowe
was
decided.
and
in
peyton
v.
rowe,
this
court
held
that
a
virginia
prisoner
could
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
a
consecutive
sentence
imposed
by
the
state
of
virginia.
on
the
basis
of
peyton
v.
rowe,
george
filed
a
motion
to
remand
the
proceedings
to
the
district
court.
we
were
given
notice
of
the
motion
and
as
our
first
appearance,
filed
in
opposition
to
the
motion
to
remand
and
move
to
dismiss
the
proceedings
on
the
grounds
that
peyton
v.
rowe
should
not
be
extended
to
the
interstate
case
that
the
california
warden
was
not
a
proper
party
respondent
in
this
habeas
corpus
action,
that
a
north
carolina
official
who
might
be
a
proper
party
respondent
was
not
before
the
court
service
of
process
had
not
been
obtained
and
couldn't
be
obtained
and
that
accordingly
the
district
court,
the
northern
district
of
california
was
without
jurisdiction
to
proceed.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes,
your
honor
from
--
we
have
been
--
although
it
is
not
in
the
record
we
have
been
in
contact
with
the
north
carolina
attorney
general's
office
since
the
interception
of
this
case.
but
their
position
is
although
it
is
not
a
matter
of
record
but
their
position
is
that
habeas
corpus
relief
is
not
presently
available
in
the
case
of
this
kind.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
is
correct
your
honor,
they
have
not
been
served
with
process,
we're
not
aware
of
any
way
in
which
they
could
be.
nevertheless,
the
court
below
disagreed.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
it
is
our
position
your
honor
that
we
don't
--
while
we
recognize
that
there
is
a
conviction
we
give
no
effect
to
it
and
so
that
habeas
corpus
relief
is
not
presently
available
in
any
court.
we
do
take
the
position
that
it
is
only
after
this
court
decides
which
we
strongly
urge
that
it
not
do
that
there
is
custody
within
the
meaning
of
the
habeas
corpus
statute
as
only
then
that
this
court
need
reach
the
question
of
what
is
the
appropriate
forum.
if
it
decides
that
custody
is
existent
in
this
case,
it's
only
then
that
it
need
decide
whether
it
is
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
the
prisoner
is
seeking
to
set
aside
north
carolina
conviction.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
it's
our
position
that
there
is
no
dispute,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
your
honor,
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
there
is
no
showing
in
this
record
that
his
parole
is
affected
by
the
north
carolina
conviction.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
what
he
said
in
the
court
below
was
that
the
fact
that
there
was
a
conviction
outstanding
assuredly
affected
his
parole.
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honor,
that
is
not
california
policy
and
we
have
submitted
a
policy
statement
of
the
adult
authority
in
the
court
below
where
there
is
a
conviction
outstanding
in
another
state.
particularly
where
that
state
happens
to
be
the
place
of
residence,
primary
place
of
residence
of
the
prisoner,
we
will
release
--
it
is
our
policy
not
frequently
invoked,
we
will
release
the
prisoner
on
parole
earlier
than
might
otherwise
be
the
case.
this
case
your
honor
this
is
our
policy.
it
is
not
like
peyton
v.
rowe
where
in
peyton
v.
rowe
you
had
consecutive
sentences
imposed
by
one
state
and
there
was
a
state
statute
which
said
that
the
concept
of
the
sentences
should
be
treated
as
one
for
purposes
of
parole
eligibility.
you
do
not
have
that
kind
of
statute
in
this
case
and
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no,
your
honor,
what
happened
after
we
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
what
happened,
your
honor,
we
were
not
given
notice
of
the
proceedings
until
the
ninth
circuit.
we
filed
an
opposition
to
the
motion
to
remand
stating
that
this
only
sentence
that
this
man
was
serving
was
a
california
sentence.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
because
that
what
the
--
in
order
for
habeas
corpus
relief
to
be
available,
he
must
be
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
sentences
seeking
the
challenge.
california
sentence
was
imposed
in
1964,
service
of
that
sentence
makes
no
difference
whether
he
was
acquitted
later
in
north
carolina
or
not.
whether
or
not
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
i
don't
think
he
could,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
because
the
--
i
don't
know
what
his
theory
of
action
could
be
if
what
he
is
challenging
is
the
reasonableness
of
prison
policy
in
considering
any
charge
or
even
a
past
conviction
in
determining
whether
or
not
he
is
more
likely
prisoner
to
escape.
then
what
he
would
be
challenging
is
the
reasonableness
of
prison
policy
but
as
yet
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
parole.
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
one
level
of
confinement
rather
than
another,
and
in
any
event
what
you
are
talking
about
in
that
case
is
the
reasonableness
of
prison
policy.
if
we
are
going
to
get
into
questions
about
whether
or
not
the
california
imprisoning
authorities
can
consider
the
fact
that
a
man’s
been
convicted
in
other
state
in
determining
to
whether
or
not
he's
eligible
for
minimum
custody.
then
your
honor
we
respectfully
submit
that
you're
going
to
also
have
to
face
the
question
that
the
past
conviction
situation
because
if
the
prison
authorities
consider
past
convictions
fully
served
in
determining
whether
the
man's
more
likely
to
escape
or
whether
his
eligible
for
minimum
custody.
then
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
the
business
of
the
court
is
going
to
be
substantially
expanded.
we
think
that
there
is
a
decided
difference
between
where
you
have
sentences
lumped
together
by
one
state
and
where
you’re
talking
about
sentences
imposed
by
another
state.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes,
your
honor.
what
we
would
like
to
make
perfectly
clear
that
this
case
isn't
like
a
case
where
california
has
used
the
conviction
of
another
state
as
a
prior
conviction
increased
the
length
of
confinement
or
to
render
habitual
criminal
status
available.
that's
not
this
case
at
all.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
california
is
itself
clear
your
honor
that
where
the
state
is
attempting
to
increase
the
length
of
statutory
service.
then
in
california,
he
may
challenge
the
out
of
state
conviction.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
it's
a
burden
of
proof
on
the
state,
your
honor
but
in
that
case
your
honor,
california
is
attempting
to
use
the
conviction
for
their
own
purposes
but
we’re
not
attempting
to
use
the
sentences
of
north
carolina
for
any
purpose
at
all.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that's
part
of
the
problem
your
honor,
that's
part
of
the
problem
but
most
importantly
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
most
importantly
your
honor,
we
are
saying
that
section
2241
(c)
3
of
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute
provides
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
shall
not
extend
to
a
prisoner
unless
he
is
in
custody
in
violation
of
a
constitution.
he
is
in
custody
under
the
california
sentence.
he
is
not
challenging
that
sentence.
that
is
why
we
say
that
custody
under
the
habeas
corpus
statute
is
lacking.
we
think
that
the
lack
of
custody
is
particularly
emphasized
by
the
courts
holding
below
that
we
are
the
agents
for
north
carolina.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
your
honor
the
record
doesn't
show
it.
the
facts
are
that
this
man
was
given
a
parole
date
an
earlier
parole
date
but
there
were
--
there
was
a
subsequent
occurrence.
it's
a
matter
of
dispute,
the
state
says
one
thing,
the
prisoner
says
another
but
there
was
another
occurrence
in
which
his
parole
date
was
cancelled.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
our
position
is
your
honor
that
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
prisoner
for
anything
connected
with
a
california
sentence
but
mr.
george
has
never
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
california
sentence.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no,
it's
our
position
your
honor
that
at
this
--
excuse
me,
challenge
a
california
sentence
in
north
carolina?
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
he
has
not
attempted
to
exhaust
his
state
remedies
in
north
carolina.
now,
two
of
the
issues
that
he
has
raised
in
his
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
california
court
have
already
been
determined
by
the
north
carolina
supreme
court.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no,
no
and
although
we
think
that
certainly
since
he
has
never
made
any
attempt
to
have
his
third
issue
determined
by
the
north
carolina
supreme
court.
in
his
petition
below,
he
first
alleged
that
the
north
carolina
sentence
was
imposed
outside
the
time
limits
provided
by
the
agreement
on
detainers
so
that
the
north
carolina
court
was
without
jurisdiction
to
proceed
and
that
this
was
a
deprivation
of
due
process.
his
second
ground
was
that
it's
all
related
to
right
to
speedy
trial.
these
were
the
two
issues
that
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
determined.
it
was
in
his
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
california
court
that
he
made
the
determination,
raised
the
issue
of
knowing
you
supported
your
testimony.
we
think
that
the
practical
difficulties
of
the
court's
decision
below
do
emphasize
the
lack
of
custody.
the
court
has
held
that
california
is
an
agent
for
north
carolina
but
as
respectfully
submitted
your
honor,
the
agency
connotes
some
sort
of
voluntary
acceptance
of
authority
and
we
have
never
assented
to
defending
a
north
carolina
conviction.
we
are
unwilling
to
do
so.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
the
court
of
appeals
has
never
said
exactly
what
our
obligation
was
your
honor,
i
suppose
that’s
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
certainly
honoring
of
the
detainer
is
a
question
solely
of
comity
your
honor.
we
don't
have
to
honor
a
detainer
but
even
if
we
didn't
give
affect
to
the
detainer,
there's
a
very
interesting
factual
situation
in
this
case
and
that
is
that
the
state
of
kansas
still
has
a
detainer
filed
against
this
man
and
the
state
of
north
carolina
knows
that.
when
and
if
this
man
is
released,
he
could
be
released
to
stand
trial
in
kansas.
as
far
as
we
know,
there's
nothing
to
preclude
the
state
of
north
carolina
than
going
to
kansas.
but
we
understand
to
and
have
their
detainer
honor
there.
or
if
that
result
would
be
the
result
that
we
didn't
honor
the
detainer,
what
the
court
is
actually
would
be
asking
us
to
do
too
is
to
giving
a
greater
right
to
a
detainer
than
we
can
give.
or
to
review
a
conviction
in
which
we
can
give
in
an
extradition
proceeding.
where
an
extradition
warrant
or
extradition
proceedings
are
instituted
in
the
california
courts.
we
can't
look
at
the
underlying
reasons
walk
through
that
extradition
warrant.
it
could
be
we
disagree
but
we
can't
do
that
under
law,
we
can't
look
at
the
underlying
facts
and
the
court
below
said
that
we
could
call
upon
the
north
carolina
officials
but
were
not
so
sure
that
they
would
be
willing
to
come
out.
number
one
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
as
i
suggest
your
honor
but
if
a
man
goes
into
another
state
in
north
carolina
possibly
to
get
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
as
i
say
your
honor,
detainer
honoring
a
detainer
solely
a
matter
of
comity
but
it
could
be
that
north
carolina
wouldn’t
have
a
detainer.
also
a
detainer
is
a
request
to
be
notified
of
a
man's
release.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
we
could
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
i
think
it's
a
very
serious
problem
your
honor,
what
the
court
below
has
asked
the
states
literally
to
fight
among
themselves
and
the
practical
problems
of
transporting
records
and
witnesses
across
country
even
assuming
you
could
get
the
witnesses.
for
example
if
the
deputy
district
attorney
who
tried
this
case
below
is
no
longer
in
the
north
carolina
state
government,
then
we
don’t
know
how
north
carolina
could
get
that
deputy
district
attorney
in
a
california
court
if
that
deputy
district
attorney
was
unwilling.
from
the
prisoner’s
point
of
view,
this
result
is
untenable.
he
is
asking
a
california
judge
to
review
a
north
carolina
conviction
the
california
judge
can't
be
familiar
with
north
carolina
procedure.
a
california
council
no
matter
how
competent
can't
know
where
to
look
for
the
records,
can't
know
what
witnesses
to
call,
can't
get
the
witnesses
as
even
before
the
california
court.
we've
not
suggested
that
there's
another
form
available
because
under
this
court's
decision
in
ahrens
v.
clark
and
under
the
traditional
rules
of
habeas
corpus.
you
must
bring
your
petition
if
at
all
in
the
district
of
confinement
but
we
think
bringing
the
suit
in
the
district
of
sentencing
has
tremendous
practical
problems
too.
you
have
problems
of
escape,
you
have
the
problems
of
the
confining
state,
might
be
unwilling
to
have
that
prisoner
go
to
the
other
state.
you
have
the
expense
problems
and
there
are
no
funds
that
we're
aware
of
to
provide
for
the
transportation
of
the
prisoner
or
its
counsel
across
the
country.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
your
honor
if
i
may
briefly
respond
to
two
primary
points.
mr.
justice
brennan
raised
the
question
of
my
representation
to
the
court.
this
is
not
a
case
and
it
is
our
representation
that
this
is
not
a
case
or
california
has
attempted
to
use
north
carolina
conviction
to
increase
the
length
of
the
california
sentence
or
to
classify
the
defendant
as
a
criminal.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no,
that
is
not
alleged.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
as
i
understand
there
is
some
allegation
that
might
affect
his
parole
consideration.
that
kind
of
allegation
was
made
below
but
that's
a
totally
different
question.
the
record
doesn't
support
and
in
fact
we
don't
think
the
record
will
support
it.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
oh!
yes,
that's
true
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
because
your
honor,
it's
--
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
presupposes
and
the
applicability
of
present
habeas
corpus
relief.
the
issue
raised
in
the
court
below
was,
is
there
presently
available
habeas
corpus
relief
and
it
is
our
position
that
is
not.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
we
do
think
in
this
instance
your
honor
that
there
hasn't
been
any
showing
of
an
attempt
to
exhaustion
but
that
is
correct.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
because
that
presupposes
that
if
there
is
some
sort
of
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
of
california,
your
honor
and
we're
unwilling,
we
don’t
believe
that
that’s
the
correct
law.
we
think
that
it
may
be
that
this
inmate
has
a
remedy
in
a
north
carolina
courts.
if
what
he
is
after
is
to
challenge
his
north
carolina
conviction
he
ought
to
attempt
to
seek
relief
in
the
north
carolina
state
courts.
that's
our
position
and
we
think
that
there's
been
no
showing
that
hes
attempted
to
do
that.
but
we
don't
think
there
is
presently
available
federal
habeas
corpus
relief.
i'd
like
to
make
clear
too
in
response
to
some
of
the
other
questions
that
were
asked
that
on
the
strike,
we
will
not
hold
a
man
one
day
longer
on
the
strength
of
a
detainer.
if
a
man's
conviction
has
expired,
a
responding
state
must
come
into
california
to
seek
and
obtain
an
extradition
warrant.
the
prisoner
can
waive
extradition
and
that's
a
different
matter.
but
if
hasn't,
we
will
release
a
man
only
pursuant
to
extradition.
in
the
parole
situation,
there
are
two
separate
ways
that
a
man
might
be
paroled.
if
the
adult
authority
which
is
our
paroling
agency
in
california
believes
this
man
has
totally
satisfied
--
is
sought
ready
for
parole,
we
will
release
the
man
subject
to
hold
which
means
that
we
will
notify
the
other
state
and
the
other
state
has
to
come
in
with
an
extradition
in
warrant.
if
we
don't
believe
the
man
is
ready
yet
for
parole
but
nevertheless
we
know
he
has
a
conviction
or
a
charge
in
another
state
and
it's
quite
clear
that
the
others
seem
to
be
clear
that
the
other
state
wishes
to
obtain
custody
which
they
can
do
under
extradition,
we
may
put
it
as
a
special
condition
of
parole
that
is
the
protocol.
now,
that
other
state
doesn't
come
in
with
extradition
warrant
or
the
prisoner
doesn't
waive
extradition,
then
we
may
reconsider
whether
the
man
ought
to
be
on
parole.
but
that's
reconsideration
under
the
california
sentence
only.
we
respectfully
submit
that
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
your
honor
as
i
recall
section
1404
(a),
that
statute
--
transfers
statute
says
that
the
case
may
be
transferred
to
an
action
where
it
might
have
been
brought.
it
is
our
position
that
this
case
could
not
have
been
brought
in
another
forum.
now,
it
is
true
word
v.
north
carolina,
the
fourth
circuit
opinion
decided
that
the
sentencing
court
wasn’t
appropriate
for
him
in
a
case
of
this
kind.
but
it's
really
fortuitous
that
in
both
cases
north
carolina
conviction
should
be
involved.
in
any
other
circuit
this
wouldn't
be
the
case,
the
other
reason
case
being
the
third
circuit
case
and
then
scoten
versus
pennsylvania
where
the
third
circuit
held
that
new
jersey
prisoners
couldn’t
challenge
future
pennsylvania
sentences
in
a
pennsylvania
court.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
i
have
read
it,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
in
the
face
of
it,
your
honor.
that
does
seem
to
be
the
case
but
it
might
be
that
in
view
that
the
north
carolina
legislature
would
be
wiling
to
change
his
mind.
it
might
be
that
if
the
proper
case
ever
rose
on
north
carolina
that
there
would
be
some
sort
of
reading
of
the
north
carolina
statute
to
encompass
a
case
of
this
kind.
there's
never
been
that
kind
of
attempt
we’re
aware
of.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
it
is
a
kind
--
excuse
me.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
it
is
a
kind
of
exhaustion
your
honor
as
we
said
--
as
i
understand
exhaustion
in
the
technical
sense.
it
does
presuppose
some
sort
of
present
habeas
corpus
sought
relief.
where
unwilling,
we
don't
think
the
law
requires
that.
we
do
think
as
far
as
the
equities
of
the
situation
are
concerned
that
the
prisoner
ought
to
make
an
attempt
in
north
carolina
to
get
some
sort
of
relief
there.
