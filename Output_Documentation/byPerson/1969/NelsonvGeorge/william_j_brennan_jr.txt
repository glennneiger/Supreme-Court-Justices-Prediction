justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
cumming,
mrs.
renne
told
us
i
think
that
if
the
alleged
that
this
north
carolina
conviction
were
being
used
some
way
by
the
california
authorities
as
bearing
on
this
time
for
release
under
the
california
conviction
that
there's
a
remedy
in
the
california
state
courts
or
a
claim
like
that,
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
if
that
is
the
law,
there
is
an
allegation
as
i
understand
it
here
that
that
is
what's
happening
that
the
california
authorities
are
using
this
north
carolina
conviction
to
his
prejudice.
i
thought
ordinarily
that
a
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding
could
not
be
entertained
until
there've
been
an
exhaustion
of
state
remedies.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
then
--
why
would
not
this
proceeding
be
premature
in
the
federal
courts
since
i
gather
there's
been
no
effort
to
begin
a
proceeding
in
the
california
state
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
on
the
record,
it
comes
to
us.
it
would
appear
that
he
hasn’t
exhausted
his
reasonable
amount
of
what
happened
below
ought
not
we
just
vacate
everything
that's
happened
and
send
it
back
to
be
held
pending
his
going
to
the
state
--california
state
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
why
not
if
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
statute
makes
it
clear
doesn't
it
that
the
federal
courts
are
not
to
entertain
federal
habeas
until
there’s
been
an
exhaustion
of
any
presently
available
remedy
in
the
state
courts,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
doesn't
that
suggest
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
doesn't
that
then
raise
another
question
that
mr.
justice
stewart
put
to
you?
if
there
has
to
be
exhaustion
of
any
available
state
remedies
before
any
federal
court
can
entertain
habeas,
may
there
not
be
in
north
carolina
a
post
conviction
remedy
which
has
not
yet
been
exhausted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
the
statute
will
require
them
to
exhaust
before
the
federal
district
court
can
entertain
this
application
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh!
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
you're
answer
to
me
is
there
is
no
north
carolina
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
that
is
the
position
you
took
earlier,
mrs.
renne.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
is
it
true
that
there
is
an
allegation
here
that
it
was
so
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
is
not
alleged
in
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
well,
yes
even
though
that's
not
true.
is
it
not
ordinary
habeas
practice
in
the
federal
district
courts
such
a
way
to
ask
the
very
first
question?
have
you
exhausted
your
state
remedies?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
wasn't
that
been
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
that
doesn't
say
that.
i
thought
ordinarily,
the
position
was
that
there
isn't
presently
available
federal
habeas
relief
until
you've
established
it
to
exhaust
all
your
state
remedies
that
are
presently
available.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
--
i
come
back
then,
why
shouldn't
this
case
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
initial
determination
now
whether
he
has
available
state
remedies
whether
in
california
or
north
carolina?
