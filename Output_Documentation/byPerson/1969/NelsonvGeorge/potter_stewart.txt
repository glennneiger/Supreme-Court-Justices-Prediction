yes,
but
at
the
threshold,
is
the
only
issue
between
california
and
the
prisoner?
is
the
only
issue
whether
the
california
authority
should
continue
to
recognize
the
north
carolina
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
but
why?
why?
what
dispute
is
there
between
him
and
the
california
authorities?
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
almost
ten
years
ago,
i
so
happen
i
wrote
an
opinion
for
the
court
which
made
me
familiar
with
the
north
carolina
post-conviction
hearing
act
which
i
learned
at
that
time
and
this
has
been
repealed
was
an
extremely
enlightened
and
progressive
piece
of
legislation.
but
i
don't
know
whether
it
applies
if
a
person
is
not
incarcerated
in
the
state.
as
i
remember,
however
it
requires
that
the
petition
very
much
like
section
2255
of
the
united
states
code
by
title
28,
the
petitioners
filed
with
a
sentencing
court,
that
would
be
available
to
your
client
would
it
or
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
north
carolina
general
statute
section
15-217
through
to
222
i
think.
are
you
familiar
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i'd
be
well
for
you
to
become
familiar
with
that.
i
think
it
would
offer
you
a
very
easy
way
of
relief
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
but
that
has
to
be
your
position?
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
be
applicable
only
to
those
imprisoned
in
north
carolina,
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
