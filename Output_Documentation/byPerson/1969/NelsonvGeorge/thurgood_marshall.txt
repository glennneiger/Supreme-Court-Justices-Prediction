marshall
mrs.
renne,
that
the
constitution
and
law
aside,
why
didn't
california
turn
him
loose
and
let
north
carolina
feed
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
take
it's
your
position
is
that
california
district
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
body
but
not
the
subject
matter.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
can
challenge
it
in
north
carolina?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
cannot
challenge
a
north
carolina
sentence
in
north
carolina
as
long
as
he
is
in
jail
if
he
outworn
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
don't
want
to
rely
on
that,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
about
kansas?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
assume
it
is,
what
do
you
do,
draw
a
lot?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
if
the
kansas
one
is
first,
then
clearly
your
case
is
in
trouble.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
did
the
north
carolina
trial
come
up?
was
that
at
his
agreement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
under
his
request,
he
left
california,
went
to
north
carolina,
was
tried
in
north
carolina,
came
back
to
california,
and
now
he
wants
to
attack
what
he
brought
on
himself?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
california?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
mr.
cumming
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
cumming,
is
your
position
that
if
you're
denied
relief
here
and
then
kansas
gets
him
before
north
carolina,
you
can
litigate
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
kansas
the
same
thing
over
again?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
cumming,
suppose
the
state
of
california
agrees
and

the
detainer
and

will
release
him
on
some
certain
dates.
what
can
you
do
about
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
specific
question
was
if
the
warden
released
the
detainer
and
sent
a
collect
telegram
so
it
won’t
cause
california
any
money.
does
the
state
of
north
carolina
say,
we
will
release
(inaudible)
at
11
o'clock
at
the
east
gate,
what
could
you
do
about

justice
thurgood
marshall
under

law
could
you
prevent
somebody
from
notifying
another
state
that
we
get
can
try
to
release
a
person?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well

what
i'm
saying.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
couldn't
do
a
thing
about
it?
justice
thurgood

pick
him
up
and
go
through
extradition
and
there
he
goes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what's
this
case
