unknown
speaker
did
you
try
to
vouch
so
to
speak
or
give
notice
to
the
north
carolina
authorities
of
this
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
that’s
based
is
it
not
of
a
theory
on
the
court
of
california
can
have
no
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
north
carolina?
unknown
speaker
do
you
want
anything
else
though
in
this
case
that
the
california
authorities
seize
giving
any
effect
or
recognition
to
the
north
carolina
judgment?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
said
so
that
it
makes
a
difference
in
terms
of
his
parole
--
unknown
speaker
--
and
things
like
that.
unknown
speaker
but
that
--
those
were
his
allegations,
weren't
they?
unknown
speaker
was
there
a
hearing
of
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
have
an
allegation
in
that
compliant
in
a
petition
that
the
north
carolina
judgment
does
make
a
difference
in
terms
of
prisoner’s
treatment
by
the
warden
of
the
california
penitentiary
and
did
the
state
respond
to
it?
did
they
file
a
return
or?
unknown
speaker
yes
but
lets
assume
for
the
moment
that
it
didn't
make
a
difference.
that
his
allegations
were
absolutely
true,
that
the
detainer
did
make
a
difference
in
his
treatment
by
the
california
authorities
to
his
harm.
wouldn't
you
think
that
would
state
some
kind
of
a
case
or
controversy
between
him
and
the
california
authorities?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
--
what
if
he
didn't
bring
a
habeas
corpus
action,
he
just
sued
the
warden
to
restrain
him
from
taking
into
account
the
north
carolina
judgment.
suppose
he
could
do
that,
couldn't
he?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
the
only
issue
in
this
case
really
is
whether
a
prisoner
detained
in
one
state
under
a
sentence
by
that
state
may
in
any
time
whether
the
sentences
of
other
states
make
any
difference
or
not
in
his
treatment
in
the
prison
whether
that
prisoner
who's
in
prison
state
a
may
raise
in
that
state
the
validity
of
some
convictions
and
state
b
that
he
hasn’t
served
yet,
that's
the
issue?
unknown
speaker
what
if
it
were
the
case?
let's
assume
that
the
north
carolina
conviction
had
been
before
the
california
conviction
and
that
conviction
had
been
used
by
california
as
a
basis
for
habitual
criminal
conviction
or
to
enhance
sentencing
and
he
is
sent
to
jail
in
california
and
then
he
brings
his
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
have
declared
unconstitutional
the
prior
conviction
of
north
carolina.
unknown
speaker
and
then
how
does
that
actually
go
forward?
this
goes
forward
as
to
the
extent
of
evidence
from
north
carolina
is
essential
or
witnesses
from
there
are
essential
and
both
sides
just
get
the
witnesses
there
don’t
they?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
in
effect
saying
there's
really
no
case
of
controversy
here
at
all
between
you
and
the
prisoner?
unknown
speaker
what
else
are
you
saying?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
visualize
as
to
what
is
the
holding
of
court
of
appeals
below
is
that
there
are
jurisdictions
on
california
over
this
proceeding,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
now
what
do
you
visualize
happening
when
you
go
back
to
the
district
court?
i'm
going
to
put
a
specific
question.
do
you
supposing
california
said
to
north
carolina,
we
give
you
an
opportunity
to
come
in
and
defend
and
if
you
don't
choose
to
do
so
we
will
erase
the
detainer.
is
that
foreclosed
under
the
district
court
under
the
court
of
appeals
decision?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
about
california's
right
to
take
that
position
vis-à-vis
north
carolina
and
say
if
we
do
not
choose
to
come
in,
we
got
no
quarrel
with
this
man
ourselves.
it's
your
judgment
that’s
being
attacked
here,
given
our
custody
be
sure
but
you
must
defend
it.
if
you
don't
choose
to
defend
it
we
will
arrange
your
detainer.
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
you
could
just
give
them
that
opportunity
and
say
well
if
you
don't
care
to
come
in
were
not
going
to
take
any
responsibility
for
this,
well
just
remove
your
detainer.
unknown
speaker
as
far
as
california
is
concerned
by
taking
that
procedure
and
refusing
to
become
the
agent
for
north
carolina
in
your
own
court
to
defend
their
conviction
of
this
man
as
you
say
all
right,
if
you
don't
want
to
come
in
we’re
not
going
to
honor
your
detainer.
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
you
have
the
right
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
but
not
only
the
fact
that
these
are
two
states
convictions
which
distinguishes
this
from
peyton
against
rowe.
but
there's
at
least
one
other
distinction
and
that
is
in
this
case
unlike
peyton
against
rowe.
the
court
in
which
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
was
filed
was
not
the
court
where
the
person
was
confined
which
is
a
distinction
is
it
not
at
some
points?
perhaps
you
think,
perhaps
it
seems
type
of
technical
but
at
least
when
i
went
to
law
school
i
always
thought
that
in
order
for
a
court
to
have
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction,
a
prisoner
have
to
be
confined
somewhere
within
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
not
that
confinement
that
he
is
attacking.
unknown
speaker
well
it
has
to
be
north
--
whenever
he
is
releasing
them
as
the
chief
justice
suggested
in
north
carolina
to
be
known
and
the
same
result
would
be
obtained,
there
is
nothing
the
warden
can
do
about
it?
unknown
speaker
if
the
warden
has
not
given
notice?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
well
what
if
the
north
carolina
stayed
outside
the
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
pardon,
could
i
ask
you
one
question?
assuming
jurisdiction
here
for
the
moment,
what
do
you
think
about
the
court
of
appeals
suggestion
that
if
it
came
down
to
the
question
of
the
new
witnesses
that
1404
(1)
transfer
and
the
1408
would
be
available?
unknown
speaker
have
you
looked
into
the
north
carolina
post-conviction
remedy
statute?
unknown
speaker
did
you
try
to
vouch
so
to
speak
or
give
notice
to
the
north

authorities
of
this
proceeding?
unknown
