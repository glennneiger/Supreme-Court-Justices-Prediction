mr.
deutsch,
did
he
cover
the
point
as
to
whose
house
this
was?
justice
thurgood
marshall
see,
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
was
thinking
about
the
relevance.
i
just
want
to
know
that
it's
just
unclear.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
were
you
searching
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
weren't
looking
for
weapons,
were
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
weren't
looking
for
anything
that
might
injure
them,
were
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
--
there
were
three
officers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
there
were
two
entrances
to
the
house;
one
front
door
and
one
back
door?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
once
they
have
found
that
there
was
nobody
in
the
house,
no
person
it
would
only
take
a
two
policemen
to
make
sure
that
nobody
disturbed
the
evidence,
would
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
we
take
one
policeman
with
the
two
prisoners?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
could’ve
left
the
prisoners
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn’t
the
record
show
that
two
police
officers
went
inside
and
one
stayed
out
with
the
prisoners?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
could
they
have
gotten
one
more
policeman
in
new
orleans
to
watch
the
backdoor
while
one
guards
the
front
door?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
evidence
could
not
have
been
destroyed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
arrest
take
place?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that’s
interfering
with
it
they
