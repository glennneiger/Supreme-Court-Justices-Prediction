justice

but
in
considering
--
in
considering
the
matters
search
and
seizure
it's
important
to
know
whether
you
--
whether
we
can
assume
that
proceed
on
a
hypothesis
that
this
was
a
lawful
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
i
suppose
that
a
search
incident
to
an
unlawful
arrest
can
never
be
a
reasonable
search
based
on
theoretical.
justice
byron
r.
white
whatever,
yet
the
scope
of
the
search.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
does
it
take
to
get
a
warrant
in
your
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
case
just
turns
out
to
james,
its
good?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
we
didn't
do
this
one
summarily
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
--
i
mean
then
you'll
have
to
assume
that
chimel
was
in
retroactive
but
the
other
case
decided
with
chimel
was
one
shipley?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
shipley
arrest,
he
simply
went
outside
and
that
makes
it
in
the
chimel
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
chimel
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it's
in
the
line
of
james?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
deutsch,
may
i
ask
you
a
moment?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that
the
court
suppose
upon
the
jurisdiction
in
this
case
rather
than
noting
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
your
fictional
question
here
is
there
is
only
a
question
of
whether
to
make
an
appeal
or
search?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
was
the
question
raised
in
motion?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
trouble
to
that?
it
might
interest
you
that
counsel
for
that
effect
is
here
a
while
ago
and
he
told
us
that
this
can
have
chimel?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
wouldn’t
you
if
they
had
arrested
him
six
or
eight
blocks
away
on
his
way
to
his
house?
say,
he
was
going
from
work
to
home
or
they
just
intercepted
him
on
the
street
and
they
thought
there
was
probable
cause
that
he
had
narcotics
in
his
house.
let's
assume
they
did
have
probable
cause,
do
you
think
he
had
narcotics
in
his
house,
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
that
you
should
not
have
to
wait
for
a
warrant
in
order
to
search
that
goes
likely
places
where
narcotics
might
be
located?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
distinguish
shipley?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
that
in
shipley
apparently
they
didn’t
have
--
even
have
probable
cause
to
search
that
house,
is
that
your
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
two
cases
you
were
referring
whether
new
jersey
case
and
the
california
case,
i
assume?
