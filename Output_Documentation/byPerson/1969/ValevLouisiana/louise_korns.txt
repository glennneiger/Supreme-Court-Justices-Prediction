ms.
louise
korns
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
louisiana
certainly
agrees
with
everything
that
mr.
deutsch
has
said
about
the
inviolability
of
homes
and
the
constitutional
prohibition
against
the
search
of
a
house
without
a
warrant.
however,
as
the
state
of
louisiana
sees
this
case,
its
issue
is
much
narrow
and
sort
of
confined
the
facts
of
this
case.
this
court
has
held
continually
and
even
as
later
chimel
that
--
ms.
louise
korns
chimel?
[laughter
attempt]
i
think
even
as
later
as
laid
as
young
as
decision
in
chimel,
it
was
taken
to
be
settled
jurisprudence
of
this
court
that
following
a
valid
arrest,
an
incidental
search
can
be
made.
now,
do
i
understand,
has
the
state
of
louisiana
certainly
argues
that
a
valid
arrest
without
warrant
was
made
in
this
case
or
at
the
right
at
the
front
door
of
the
house
--
front
steps
of
the
house.
we
concede
that
it
was
not
in
the
house,
it
was
--
vale
was
returning
to
his
house.
now,
if
a
valid
arrest
was
made,
an
incidental
search
contemporaneous
with
this
arrest
under
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
on
incidental
search
was
permissible.
and
as
the
state
of
louisiana
sees
that
the
only
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
scope
of
that
incidental
search
was
also
permissible.
in
other
words,
--
ms.
louise
korns
the
police
officers
testified
mr.
justice
marshall
that
they
were
sure
that
there
were
narcotics
in
that
house
because
as
they
watched
the
house
to
be
sure
donald
vale
was
there
before
going
forward
with
these
prior
arrest
warrants
they
had
that
what
they
saw
convinced
them
that
donald
vale
had
gone
back
into
that
house
to
get
the
narcotics
which
he
brought
out
and
sold
to
saucier
--
ms.
louise
korns
no
sir,
they
were
looking
for
narcotics
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
ms.
louise
korns
no,
sir.
they
were
looking,
the
state
of
louisiana
concedes
because
it's
from
the
record,
the
state
of
louisiana
has
to
concede.
the
police
officers
testified
that
they
were
sure
there
were
narcotics
in
that
house
from
which
james
vale
was
--
donald
vale
had
going
in.
they
were
sure
that
was
where
his
supply
was
that
he
would
come
out
of
that
house
and
sell
to
the
people
who
would
come
up
to
the
house
like
saucier
in
instance
case.
so
they
--
when
they
saw
him
go
back
in
the
house,
come
back
in
out
without
within
minutes,
looked
up
and
down
the
street
as
he
went
down
the
steps
and
put
his
head
in
the
car,
and
what
they
were
convinced
was
a
narcotic
sale.
and
then
when
they
approached
the
house,
an
saucier
swallowed
the
narcotics
and
they
frisked
down
saucier
and
donald
vale
and
found
nothing
on
them,
they
testified
that
they
were
convinced
that
the
source
of
those
narcotics
were
in
that
house.
so,
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
issue
in
this
case
as
the
state
of
louisiana
sees
it
is
a
very
narrow
one
was
the
scope
of
their
search
incident
to
donald
vale's
legal
arrest
constitutionally
permissible
in
scope.
that
is
there's
no
doubt
about
it
that
under
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court,
they
had
the
right
following
this
valid
arrest
without
warrant
and
from
the
house
to
frisked
down
saucier
and
vale.
no
doubt
about
that
under
the
settled
decisions
of
this
court.
now,
the
state
of
louisiana
and
under
the
chimel
decision,
the
incidental
arrest
has
been
confined
to
the
area
within
which
the
accused
could
reach.
well,
there's
no
doubt
about
it
that
the
search
in
the
instant
case
went
beyond
the
area
into
which
donald
vale
could've
reach
because
it
was
inside
the
house.
now,
though
it's
louisiana's
position
that
this
was
an
emergency
situation
and
that
it
was
impossible
to
get
a
search
warrant
--
impossible
to
get
a
search
warrant
in
advance
because
they
didn't
know
that
they
were
going
to
be
confronted
with
this
emergency
sale
which
took
place
before
their
eyes.
they
thought
they
were
just
going
there
to
arrest
this
man
on
prior
narcotics
charges.
so,
they
couldn't
have
brought
along
a
search
warrant,
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
is
it
time
for
the
court
to
recess,
your
honors?
ms.
louise
korns
well,
they
couldn't
have
gotten
a
search
warrant
in
advance
on
going
into
this
house.
ms.
louise
korns
apparently,
about
15
minutes
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
reason
they
were
watching
this
house
was
that
donald
vale
operated
from
three
or
four
addresses.
ms.
louise
korns
they
had
arrested
him
at
other
addresses
previously
and
they
just
testified
that
they
--
before
approaching
the
house
and
letting
james
vale,
his
brother
and
mrs.
vale
his
mother
know
that
they
were
looking
for
donald
with
an
arrest
warrant.
they
didn't
want
him
to
be
elated
to
this
fact.
and
therefore,
they
wanted
to
be
--
they
have
gotten
a
tip
that
he
was
selling
from
this
address
at
that
day
or
that
he
was
at
this
address
that
day,
let's
say.
ms.
louise
korns
that
they
could
pick
him
up
at
this
address
that
day.
ms.
louise
korns
no.
no,
that's
a
mistake.
they
just
said
they
have
been
told
what
he
was
at
this
address
and
they
testified
that
they
took
up
their
position
to
watch
because
they
want
to
be
sure
he
was
there
before
they
--
they
wanted
to
see
him
when
they
approached
in
to
serve
the
arrest
warrants
because
they
didn't
want
him
to
doth
again
and
because
this
was
an
alias
capias
that
issued
for
him
when
he
had
failed
to
appeal.
so,
they
watched
actually
i
was
completely
wrong
when
i
said,
they
thought
he
was
selling
and
they
did.
they
watched
to
be
able
to
serve
the
arrest
warrant.
i
see
that
my
--
ms.
louise
korns
thank
you,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
korns
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
to
briefly
recap
the
factual
situation
here,
three
new
orleans
police
officers
went
to
1826
o.
st.
in
new
orleans
bearing
two
arrest
warrants
for
donald
vale
involving
prior
narcotic
crimes.
they
wanted
to
be
sure
that
the
accused
is
at
this
address
before
serving
these
warrants.
they
knew
that
mrs.
vale,
his
mother
and
his
brother
donald
live
there
and
they
want
to
elate
donald
have
him
take
off
again.
so,
they
parked
their
car
about
half
a
block
from
the
house
and
watched
it
and
they
saw
about
15
minutes
later
they
saw
a
transaction
take
place
between
a
man,
saucier
who
approached
the
house
in
a
car
and
donald
vale
who
came
out
of
the
house
and
apparently
sold
narcotics
to
this
man
in
the
car.
so,
they
approached
the
car,
arrested
donald
vale
and
saucier.
donald
vale,
as
he
got
close
to
go
back
in
his
house
arrest
them
for
possession
of
narcotics.
first,
meanwhile
they
had
seen
as
they
approached,
they
had
seen
the
man
in
the
car
put
something
in
his
mouth
and
swallow
it
which
to
experienced
narcotics
officers
like
this
just
meant
one
thing
that
he
was
swallowing
narcotics.
so,
after
they
arrested
the
man
in
the
car
and
donald
vale,
they
frisked
and
briefly
found
nothing
on
them,
no
weapons,
no
narcotics.
and
then
the
police
officers
the
record
shows
told
donald
vale
that
they
want
to
go
in
and
search
his
house.
the
door
to
which
he
had
left
open
in
coming
out
to
make
this
sale
to
find
the
narcotics
that
they
were
sure
were
the
source
of
this
supply
that
he
had
passed
on
to
saucier.
thereupon,
they
entered
the
house.
shortly
thereafter
within
minutes
thereafter
mrs.
vale
and
donald's
brother
james
entered
the
house
and
the
police
officers
informed
them
also
they
were
going
to
make
the
search.
and
the
within
five
or
ten
minutes
in
the
back
bedroom
which
appear
to
be
a
man's
bedroom,
the
police
officers
testified
they
found
the
heroin
and
dilaudid
they
were
seeking
in
the
coat,
several
coats
hanging
in
a
closed
locker.
the
state
of
louisiana
believes
that
following
the
legal
arrest
which
clearly
took
place
here
in
front
of
the
house,
the
police
officers
were
entitled
to
make
an
incidental
search.
ms.
louise
korns
what
they
had
seen
mr.
justice
stewart.
we
don’t
rely
at
all
on
those
capiases
there's
no
--
the
state
of
louisiana
feels
that
if
they
fade
out
the
picture
as
far
as
this
search
went.
they
only
served
is
adding
probable
cause
for
the
warrantless
arrest
because
they
were
for
prying
narcotics
offenses
which
had
occurred
a
couple
of
weeks
before
and
more
over.
at
least
one
of
these
three
offices
had
been
involved,
the
record
shows
in
those
prior
arrest
and
the
record
also
shows
that,
at
least
one
or
more
of
these
officers
had
not
only
arrested
donald
vale
either
been
a
connect
with
these
prior
narcotics
arrest
that
were
familiar
with
him
in
his
narcotics
transactions,
knew
saucier
the
man
to
whom
he
was
apparently
selling,
knew
that
this
house
was
lived
in
by
mrs.
vale,
donald’s
mother
and
his
brother
james.
the
record
shows
that
they
knew
that.
so
the
state
of
louisiana
is
not
relying
at
all
on
these
capiases
for
this
arrest,
but
only
on
this
warrantless
arrest
which
took
place
before
the
house.
ms.
louise
korns
now,
the
evidence
shows
that
the
police
officers
didn’t
know
who
was
in
that
house
when
they
arrested
donald
and
saucier
in
front.
it
shows
that
officers
were
very
concerned
with
the
idea
that
at
this
very
moment
either
mrs.
vale
or
brother
james
or
donald’s
girlfriend
who
traveled
around
with
him
to
various
addresses
was
right
at
that
very
time
getting
either
hiding
the
narcotics,
taking
him
out
the
backdoor,
disposing
of
them
in
some
way.
so,
as
louisiana
sees
it.
there
was
the
dilemma
faced
by
these
officers
and
they
either
had
to
seize
this
evidence
right
now
or
not
at
all
because
i
know
yesterday
the
court
was
opposing
the
problem
of
whether
there
were
any
alternatives
to
an
immediate
warrantless
search
and
as
a
practical
matter
it’s
louisiana’s
position
that
there
were
no
practical
alternatives
because
of
the
time
involved
in
getting
a
warrant
and
the
fact
that
--
one
thing
is
clear,
not
knowing
whether
anyone
was
in
the
house
or
not,
the
officers
had
to
enter
the
house
and
search
it
fairly
thoroughly
to
find
out
even
if
whether
someone
else
was
in
the
house
because
confederates
often
hide
in
closets
and
under
beds
as
this
court
knows
and
it
was
only
about
fairly
thorough
search
of
the
house
that
the
officers
could
even
determine
that
there
was
no
one
in
the
house
to
dispose
--
ms.
louise
korns
no
that’s
perfectly
true,
that’s
right.
but
they
had
to
make
a
search
of
the
house
in
fair
detail
to
be
sure
that
no
one
was
hiding
in
the
house,
in
closets,
in
rooms,
and
so
forth
and
under
beds.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
actually
i
think
the
question
of
firearms
i
guess
is
always
lurking
in
the
background
but
with
what
narcotics
addicts
generally,
i
don’t
think
weapons
are
generally
involved
in
these
crimes.
i
think
mostly
it’s
the
police
officers
they're
concerned
and
the
record
here
shows
with
getting
to
the
evidence
before
the
people
involved
with
the
narcotics
can
get
rid
of
it
just
like
in
this
case,
saucier
got
rid
of
the
narcotics
which
vale
had
just
sold
in
by
swallowing.
and
the
officers,
the
record
here
show
that
they
rushed
first
to
the
bathroom
to
listen
for
the
sound
of
running
water
when
they
approached,
they
testified
that
and
looked
around
in
the
toilet
bowl
and
so
forth
because
looked
in
the
basin
and
in
any
drain
like
that
where
narcotics
could
be
disposed
off.
so,
really
i
think
--
i
don’t
think
i
will
be
frank
and
say
no
i
don’t
think
the
officers
were
afraid
that
they’d
be
shot
at
from
the
house
or
anything.
i
think
their
primary
and
only
purpose
was
to
try
to
get
hold
of
this
narcotics
which
they
were
convinced
donald
vale,
they
just
seen
him
sell
but
because
of
saucier
swallowing
that
evidence
they
--
because
that
would
have
been
there
right
there
if
saucier
didn’t
swallow
the
evidence
and
arrested
vale
for
this
present
narcotics
sale
and
the
saucier
had
the
evidence
that
would’ve
been
it.
ms.
louise
korns
your
honor,
it
didn’t
even
come
up
there
is
--
ms.
louise
korns
and
that's
right,
there
is
no
testimony
at
all
on
that
subject
and
really
i
don’t
think
it
--
you
know
was
a
matter
in
which
anyone
on
either
the
defense
or
the
accuse
were
interested
at
the
trial
of
this
case
for
instance
only
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
sure
i
mean
i
think
they
--
i
don’t
think
there
is
concerned
no
with
guns
for
narcotics
addicts
as
they
also
for
say
burglary
suspects
are
people
who
commit
crimes
of
violence.
there's
no
doubt
about
it
when
they
--
when
they
frisked
down
vale
and
saucier.
when
they
first
arrested
them,
they
--
i
think
the
record
will
show
maybe
that
they
were
frisking
for
possibility
of
weapons
or
narcotics,
but
they
did
testify
that
they
wanted
to
go
in
that
house
because
they
were
sure
that
that's
where
the
hoard
of
narcotics
were.
ms.
louise
korns
that’s
right,
the
thing
is
that
they
didn’t
know
that
though
mr.
justice
stewart
until
they
had
gone
all
through
the
house
to
be
sure
because
they
knew
that
mrs.
vale
and
james
live
there
and
then
of
course
when
mrs.
vale
and
james
showed
up
within
about
five
minutes
after
the
officers
got
in
the
house
has
but
before
they’d
found
the
narcotics.
then,
the
only
other
place
they
could’ve
been
hiding
in
there
was
donald’s
girlfriend,
but
i
think
by
that
time
they’d
run
through
the
house
enough
to
be
sure
that
nobody
was
in
the
house.
but
they
didn’t
know
this
until
they
got
in.
ms.
louise
korns
the
fact
is
there
was
nobody,
but
they
have
no
way
of
knowing
this.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
i
say
the
record
shows
that
they
positively
knew
that
somebody
could
be
there.
now,
the
state
of
louisiana
just
wants
to
oppose
to
this
court
the
practical
difficulties
involved
if
the
police
were
going
to
get
a
warrant
to
search
for
this
narcotic
evidence.
as
i
say,
they
first
had
to
get
into
the
house
to
be
sure
no
one
was
hiding
in
there
or
would’ve
done
no
good
to
put
a
cord
in
around
the
house
without
first
finding
out
there
was
nobody
in
it.
having
found
out
that
the
only
two
people
on
it
were
james
and
mrs.
vale
then
they
would’ve
had
to
call
in
other
police
officers
to
keep
these
people
under
surveillance.
their
movements
under
complete
surveillance
are
to
keep
--
take
them
out
of
the
house
during
the
time
in
which
they
took
them
to
get
a
search
warrant.
and
in
owing
to
perish
at
least,
search
warrant
issued
by
criminal
district
court
judges
and
at
least
one
of
these
arresting
officers
because
only
they
three
knew
the
facts
would’ve
had
to
go
back
to
the
police
bureau
and
typed
up
the
affidavit.
and
you
have
to
type
up
an
affidavit
for
a
search
warrant
in
about
six
duplicates.
police
officers
don’t
reduce
probable
cause
to
writing
with
the
greatest
to
speed.
it’s
been
my
experience
these
men
often
have
all
kind
of
reasons
why
they
do
things.
they're
not
the
most
articulate
people
in
the
world
particularly
when
they
have
to
write
down
and
often
in
the
past
they
used
to
put
down
too
little
but
now
because
court
decisions
throw
out
worst
they
put
down
much
too
much.
they
put
down
everything
they’ve
seen
and
gone
and
so
forth
and
so
it
runs
on
for
pages.
then,
they’ve
got
to
find
the
judge
to
study
this
warrant
and
find
out
whether
it’s
stays
probable
cause
and
if
he’s
in
his
court
or
in
his
chambers
and
busy
they
have
to
wait,
and
then
present
it
to
him
and
if
he’s
going
home
then
they
have
to
track
him
down
and
find
him
and
i
think
at
the
best
with
everything
going
in
your
favor
takes
at
least
three
hours
to
process
a
search
warrant.
and
often
it
takes
a
whole
day
before
you
can
get
the
whole
thing
typed
up
and
the
judge
satisfied
and
signed
and
back
and
served
the
copies.
you
have
to
give
one
to
another
clerk’s
office
so
they’ll
know
what
property
they’re
going
to
seize
and
then
make
returns
and
so
forth.
so
really
you
know
these
the
officers,
the
record
here
shows
that
the
officers
approached
donald
vale’s
house
around
noon
with
luck
they
could
very
well
have
been
back
with
the
search
warrant
later
to
that
afternoon.
but
if
any
little
interference
had
come
up
for
some
reason
or
another
they
might
not
have
been
back
until
the
next
day
and
unless
they
had
kept
these
people
under
close
surveillance,
they
would’ve
been
any
narcotics
evidence
left
in
that
house
when
they
got
back.
and
also
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
in
the
first
place
they
didn’t
know
that
they
hadn't
been
seen
by
the
vales
and
actually
probably
knew
there
were
people
in
the
house
watching
everything
they
did
or
they
might
very
well
have
been
neighbors
watching
what
they
did.
we
don’t
know
about
that
but
these
things
get
around
very
quickly
among
people
of
this
type.
not
only
that
mrs.
vale
and
james
came
back
to
the
house
within
minutes
after
the
police
officers
got
in
to
house.
so
therefore,
but
they
might’ve
very
well
have
gotten
back
to
the
house
seeing
the
police
officers
put
saucier
and
donald
into
the
cars.
i
mean,
this
--
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
your
honor.
a
residential
small
sort
of
shotgun
house
is
close
to
each
other.
ms.
louise
korns
yes.
ms.
louise
korns
there
wasn’t
backdoor
entrance
leading
into
the
yard.
this
is
clear
because
the
record
shows
that
the
officer
--
one
of
the
officers
run
out
the
backdoor
and
looked
in
the
yard
and
see
if
there
was
any
disposable
evidence.
ms.
louise
korns
that’s
right
but
mr.
justice
--
ms.
louise
korns
couldn’t
have
done
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
one
policeman
couldn’t
drive
two
prisoners
and
that
would
be
bad
security.
you
have
to
at
least
to
have
two
police
officers
in
the
car
with
two
prisoners.
one
police
officer
is
so
to
drive
and
one
to
watch
the
prisoners.
ms.
louise
korns
there's
no
doubt
about
it
they
could
--
ms.
louise
korns
no,
i
don’t
believe
sir.
i
think
the
record
shows
that
all
of
them
went
in.
all
the
police
officers
and
donald
vale
and
saucier
and
that
then
mrs.
vale
and
james
arrived.
ms.
louise
korns
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
there’s
no
doubt
about
they
couldn’t.
ms.
louise
korns
no
doubt
about
it.
the
louisiana
did
say
they
could’ve
--
position
as
this
would
have
taken
a
long
time
and
it
would
have
interfered
with
the
liberty
of
mrs.
vale
and
james
vale
inordinately?
and
supposing
in
the
end
they
haven’t
found
any?
ms.
louise
korns
they
only
arrested
him
after
they
found
the
narcotic
evidence.
ms.
louise
korns
no,
well
they
arrested
him
for
possession
of
narcotics
mr.
justice
marshall
after
they
had
searched
the
house
and
found
the
narcotics
in
his
bedroom
as
his
mother
said.
but
we’re
talking
about
the
preliminary
situation
when
the
officers
had
just
arrested
donald
and
saucier
right
outside
the
house
engaged
in
a
narcotic
transaction
and
then
the
whole
issue
they
had
to
decide
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
was
whether
to
go
in
that
house
and
look
for
those
narcotics.
they
didn’t
know
whether
anyone
was
in
the
house
or
not.
that’s
the
situation
we
have
right
there.
they
have
to
go
in
the
house
to
see
if
anyone
was
there.
now,
there's
no
doubt
it
we
can
see
that
they
could’ve
gone
in
and
look
around
and
seen
no
one
was
there
then
they
could’ve
called
other
police,
placed
guards
on
the
house
and
gone
out
and
got
a
warrant.
this
would’ve
take
in
anywhere
from
three
hours
to
the
next
day.
we
concede
that.
ms.
louise
korns
no,
mr.
justice
white
here
of
course
we’re
relying
on
the
settled
decisions
of
this
court
that
following
a
valid
arrest
the
police
can
make
a
search
incident
to
that
arrest
at
the
place
of
the
arrest.
and
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
the
place
was
extended
a
little
too
far
as
we
said
because
donald
vale
was
arrested
at
the
front
door
of
his
house.
ms.
louise
korns
shipley,
we
distinguish
very
clearly.
in
that
--
in
shipley
for
instance
the
only
similarity
between
this
case
and
shipley
is
that
both
arrests
took
place
outside
the
house
but
unlike
this
case
in
shipley,
the
police
officers
weren’t
watching
and
didn’t
see
shipley
going
in
and
out
of
his
house
committing
a
crime.
shipley
had
committed
that
crime
several
days
before
and
they
were
just
at
his
house
to
arrest
him
for
this
crime
they’ve
heard
about.
secondly,
shipley
didn’t
involve
narcotics
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
right.
the
thing
is
that
i
see
it
shipley
then
hour
of
that
they
could’ve
got
a
search
warrant
and
shipley
as
this
court
pointed
out
they
stake
--
they
first
went
into
the
house
and
shipley
and
they
already
eluded
shipley’s
associates
to
the
fact
that
they
went
search
because
his
wife
was
in
there.
they
already
knew
then
they
went
back
out
and
stake
to
that.
now
during
the
stakeout
they
could’ve
which
went
on
for
several
hours,
they
certainly
could’ve
gotten
a
warrant.
it
wasn’t
the
emergency
situation
which
here
this
emergency
situation
just
developed
in
front
of
the
officers
as
they
went
to
serve
these
two
old
alias
capiases.
they
were
presented
with
this
emergency
situation
completely
unforeseen,
the
sale
took
place
in
front
of
there
eyes.
then
what
they
were
going
to
do
about
trying
to
get
that
evidence
which
they
knew
was
in
that
house.
it
all
happened
just
like
that.
ms.
louise
korns
not
at
all,
not
only
that
but
the
house
wouldn’t
be
the
place
of
the
arrest
here
it’s
true
that
the
arrest
took
place
at
the
front
steps
of
the
house
but
remember
this,
donald
vale
had
gone
into
the
house
when
saucier
had
first
given
him
let
him
know
he
want
a
narcotics
had
come
out
of
the
house,
leaving
the
door
open,
looking
up
and
down.
when
vale
saw
the
police
officers
approached
his
house
and
arrest
him
right
there
at
the
car,
he
turned
around
and
started
toward
the
front
door
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
the
police
officer
had
been
aware
of
all
the
decisions
which
police
officers
aren’t.
if
i've
been
there
i
would
just
wait
that
the
minute
let
donald
walk
back
into
his
house
and
then
when
a
few
steps
he
would’ve
been
inside
the
house
and
you
say,
alright
--
alright,
although
under
chimel
i
guess
you
would’ve
had
to
lame
walk
all
the
way
back
to
the
closest.
but
anyway,
nevertheless,
it
was
so
clearly
a
question
of
the
arrest
taking
place
at
the
scene
you
know
of
the
search
talking
place
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
immediately
contemporaneous
with
the
crime.
that
we
think
these
are
the
facts
at
which
governed
this
case
and
would
clearly
distinguish
an
arrest
which
took
place
on
the
street
for
instance.
there,
the
place
of
the
arrest
would
be
the
street
and
there
the
officers
would
only
look
around
the
feet
of
the
accused
for
instance.
now,
the
state
of
louisiana
feels
that
this
emergency
situation
is
so
similar
to
the
one
that
existed
to
schmerber
for
instance
or
in
warden
versus
hayden
and
we
can't
see
the
difference.
of
course
in
schmerber
it
involved
a
blood
sample
and
in
warden
versus
hayden
it
involved
burglary
--
fruits
of
the
burglary.
but
nevertheless,
the
basic
situation
is
the
same.
the
police
officers
are
faced
with
a
situation
in
which
they’ve
got
to
act
quickly
or
the
evidence
they
are
going
to
seize
is
not
going
to
be
there
anymore.
they're
faced
with
this
situation
and
narcotic
evidence
disappears
just
as
rapidly
as
does
alcohol
in
the
blood.
not
only
that,
i’d
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
if
police
officers
can't
make
searches
for
narcotics
such
as
existed
in
the
present
case,
they
can't
really
ever
seize
this
evidence
because
how
would
they
able
to
get
a
search
warrant
for
instance
although
--
no,
let's
say
the
police
officer
is
like
in
the
present
case
knew
that
donald
vale
was
operating
from
four
or
five
different
addresses.
now,
supposing
they
had
gone
to
--
had
made
out
a
search
warrant
about
six
of
them,
four
or
five
addresses,
one
for
his
car,
one
for
his
person.
all
simultaneous
and
taking
him
to
a
criminal
district
court
judge
all
residing
probable
cause
to
believe
that
this
particular
warrant
were
discovered
would
turn
out
narcotics.
the
judges
signed
them
all
then
he
had
gone
around
and
executed
all
these
warrants
and
one
of
them
that
had
found
narcotics.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
accused,
all
he
had
to
do
is
go
and
say,
how
could
you
have
probable
cause
for
this
one
warrant
when
you
sign
--
when
you
got
that
five
others
and
you
really
didn’t
know
where
it
was
did
you
and
no
you
didn’t.
and
how
do
you
know
where
the
narcotic
evidence
is
in
the
case
like
this
where
this
guy
--
these
people
are
very
smart
and
they
jump
around
and
they
change
where
they
keep
the
narcotic
hoard
on
the
person
and
the
car
in
different
place.
so,
how
would
the
police
ever
get?
ms.
louise
korns
no,
not
connecting
houses
your
honor.
donald
vale,
this
was
his
mother
and
brother’s
house.
he
had
an
apartment
of
his
own,
he
sometimes
stays
in
his
girlfriend’s
apartment
or
friend’s
apartment
operated
of
an
automobile
but
he’s
an
intelligent
man
enough
to
know
that
if
he
doesn’t
keep
moving
and
keep
his
narcotic
stock
quickly
shifting
around
then
it’s
going
to
get
seized.
now,
are
there
any
questions
of
court
would
like
to
ask?
ms.
louise
korns
thank
you,
your
honors.
ms.
louise
korns
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
louisiana
certainly
agrees
with
everything
that
mr.
deutsch
has
said
about
the
inviolability
of
homes
and
the
constitutional
prohibition
against
the
search
of
a
house
without
a
warrant.
however,
as
the
state
of
louisiana
sees
this
case,
its
issue
is
much
narrow
and
sort
of
confined
the
facts
of
this
case.
this
court
has
held
continually
and
even
as
later
chimel
that
--
ms.
louise
korns
chimel?
[laughter
attempt]
i
think
even
as
later
as
laid
as
young
as
decision
in
chimel,
it
was
taken
to
be
settled
jurisprudence
of
this
court
that
following
a
valid
arrest,
an
incidental
search
can
be
made.
now,
do
i
understand,
has
the
state
of
louisiana
certainly
argues
that
a
valid
arrest
without
warrant
was
made
in
this
case
or
at
the
right
at
the
front
door
of
the
house
--
front
steps
of
the
house.
we
concede
that
it
was
not
in
the
house,
it
was
--
vale
was
returning
to
his
house.
now,
if
a
valid
arrest
was
made,
an
incidental
search
contemporaneous
with
this
arrest
under
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
on
incidental
search
was
permissible.
and
as
the
state
of
louisiana
sees
that
the
only
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
scope
of
that
incidental
search
was
also
permissible.
in
other
words,
--
ms.
louise
korns
the
police
officers
testified
mr.
justice
marshall
that
they
were
sure
that
there
were
narcotics
in
that
house
because
as
they
watched
the
house
to
be
sure
donald
vale
was
there
before
going
forward
with
these
prior
arrest
warrants
they
had
that
what
they
saw
convinced
them
that
donald
vale
had
gone
back
into
that
house
to
get
the
narcotics
which
he
brought
out
and
sold
to
saucier
--
ms.
louise
korns
no
sir,
they
were
looking
for
narcotics
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
ms.
louise
korns
no,
sir.
they
were
looking,
the
state
of
louisiana
concedes
because
it's
from
the
record,
the
state
of
louisiana
has
to
concede.
the
police
officers
testified
that
they
were
sure
there
were
narcotics
in
that
house
from
which
james
vale
was
--
donald
vale
had
going
in.
they
were
sure
that
was
where
his
supply
was
that
he
would
come
out
of
that
house
and
sell
to
the
people
who
would
come
up
to
the
house
like
saucier
in
instance
case.
so
they
--
when
they
saw
him
go
back
in
the
house,
come
back
in
out
without
within
minutes,
looked
up
and
down
the
street
as
he
went
down
the
steps
and
put
his
head
in
the
car,
and
what
they
were
convinced
was
a
narcotic
sale.
and
then
when
they
approached
the
house,
an
saucier
swallowed
the
narcotics
and
they
frisked
down
saucier
and
donald
vale
and
found
nothing
on
them,
they
testified
that
they
were
convinced
that
the
source
of
those
narcotics
were
in
that
house.
so,
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
issue
in
this
case
as
the
state
of
louisiana
sees
it
is
a
very
narrow
one
was
the
scope
of
their
search
incident
to
donald
vale's
legal
arrest
constitutionally
permissible
in
scope.
that
is
there's
no
doubt
about
it
that
under
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court,
they
had
the
right
following
this
valid
arrest
without
warrant
and
from
the
house
to
frisked
down
saucier
and
vale.
no
doubt
about
that
under
the
settled
decisions
of
this
court.
now,
the
state
of
louisiana
and
under
the
chimel
decision,
the
incidental
arrest
has
been
confined
to
the
area
within
which
the
accused
could
reach.
well,
there's
no
doubt
about
it
that
the
search
in
the
instant
case
went
beyond
the
area
into
which
donald
vale
could've
reach
because
it
was
inside
the
house.
now,
though
it's
louisiana's
position
that
this
was
an
emergency
situation
and
that
it
was
impossible
to
get
a
search
warrant
--
impossible
to
get
a
search
warrant
in
advance
because
they
didn't
know
that
they
were
going
to
be
confronted
with
this
emergency
sale
which
took
place
before
their
eyes.
they
thought
they
were
just
going
there
to
arrest
this
man
on
prior
narcotics
charges.
so,
they
couldn't
have
brought
along
a
search
warrant,
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
is
it
time
for
the
court
to
recess,
your
honors?
ms.
louise
korns
well,
they
couldn't
have
gotten
a
search
warrant
in
advance
on
going
into
this
house.
ms.
louise
korns
apparently,
about
15
minutes
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
reason
they
were
watching
this
house
was
that
donald
vale
operated
from
three
or
four
addresses.
ms.
louise
korns
they
had
arrested
him
at
other
addresses
previously
and
they
just
testified
that
they
--
before
approaching
the
house
and
letting
james
vale,
his
brother
and
mrs.
vale
his
mother
know
that
they
were
looking
for
donald
with
an
arrest
warrant.
they
didn't
want
him
to
be
elated
to
this
fact.
and
therefore,
they
wanted
to
be
--
they
have
gotten
a
tip
that
he
was
selling
from
this
address
at
that
day
or
that
he
was
at
this
address
that
day,
let's
say.
ms.
louise
korns
that
they
could
pick
him
up
at
this
address
that
day.
ms.
louise
korns
no.
no,
that's
a
mistake.
they
just
said
they
have
been
told
what
he
was
at
this
address
and
they
testified
that
they
took
up
their
position
to
watch
because
they
want
to
be
sure
he
was
there
before
they
--
they
wanted
to
see
him
when
they
approached
in
to
serve
the
arrest
warrants
because
they
didn't
want
him
to
doth
again
and
because
this
was
an
alias
capias
that
issued
for
him
when
he
had
failed
to
appeal.
so,
they
watched
actually
i
was
completely
wrong
when
i
said,
they
thought
he
was
selling
and
they
did.
they
watched
to
be
able
to
serve
the
arrest
warrant.
i
see
that
my
--
ms.
louise
korns
thank
you,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
korns
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
to
briefly
recap
the
factual
situation
here,
three
new
orleans
police
officers
went
to
1826
o.
st.
in
new
orleans
bearing
two
arrest
warrants
for
donald
vale
involving
prior
narcotic
crimes.
they
wanted
to
be
sure
that
the
accused
is
at
this
address
before
serving
these
warrants.
they
knew
that
mrs.
vale,
his
mother
and
his
brother
donald
live
there
and
they
want
to
elate
donald
have
him
take
off
again.
so,
they
parked
their
car
about
half
a
block
from
the
house
and
watched
it
and
they
saw
about
15
minutes
later
they
saw
a
transaction
take
place
between
a
man,
saucier
who
approached
the
house
in
a
car
and
donald
vale
who
came
out
of
the
house
and
apparently
sold
narcotics
to
this
man
in
the
car.
so,
they
approached
the
car,
arrested
donald
vale
and
saucier.
donald
vale,
as
he
got
close
to
go
back
in
his
house
arrest
them
for
possession
of
narcotics.
first,
meanwhile
they
had
seen
as
they
approached,
they
had
seen
the
man
in
the
car
put
something
in
his
mouth
and
swallow
it
which
to
experienced
narcotics
officers
like
this
just
meant
one
thing
that
he
was
swallowing
narcotics.
so,
after
they
arrested
the
man
in
the
car
and
donald
vale,
they
frisked
and
briefly
found
nothing
on
them,
no
weapons,
no
narcotics.
and
then
the
police
officers
the
record
shows
told
donald
vale
that
they
want
to
go
in
and
search
his
house.
the
door
to
which
he
had
left
open
in
coming
out
to
make
this
sale
to
find
the
narcotics
that
they
were
sure
were
the
source
of
this
supply
that
he
had
passed
on
to
saucier.
thereupon,
they
entered
the
house.
shortly
thereafter
within
minutes
thereafter
mrs.
vale
and
donald's
brother
james
entered
the
house
and
the
police
officers
informed
them
also
they
were
going
to
make
the
search.
and
the
within
five
or
ten
minutes
in
the
back
bedroom
which
appear
to
be
a
man's
bedroom,
the
police
officers
testified
they
found
the
heroin
and
dilaudid
they
were
seeking
in
the
coat,
several
coats
hanging
in
a
closed
locker.
the
state
of
louisiana
believes
that
following
the
legal
arrest
which
clearly
took
place
here
in
front
of
the
house,
the
police
officers
were
entitled
to
make
an
incidental
search.
ms.
louise
korns
what
they
had
seen
mr.
justice
stewart.
we
don’t
rely
at
all
on
those
capiases
there's
no
--
the
state
of
louisiana
feels
that
if
they
fade
out
the
picture
as
far
as
this
search
went.
they
only
served
is
adding
probable
cause
for
the
warrantless
arrest
because
they
were
for
prying
narcotics
offenses
which
had
occurred
a
couple
of
weeks
before
and
more
over.
at
least
one
of
these
three
offices
had
been
involved,
the
record
shows
in
those
prior
arrest
and
the
record
also
shows
that,
at
least
one
or
more
of
these
officers
had
not
only
arrested
donald
vale
either
been
a
connect
with
these
prior
narcotics
arrest
that
were
familiar
with
him
in
his
narcotics
transactions,
knew
saucier
the
man
to
whom
he
was
apparently
selling,
knew
that
this
house
was
lived
in
by
mrs.
vale,
donald’s
mother
and
his
brother
james.
the
record
shows
that
they
knew
that.
so
the
state
of
louisiana
is
not
relying
at
all
on
these
capiases
for
this
arrest,
but
only
on
this
warrantless
arrest
which
took
place
before
the
house.
ms.
louise
korns
now,
the
evidence
shows
that
the
police
officers
didn’t
know
who
was
in
that
house
when
they
arrested
donald
and
saucier
in
front.
it
shows
that
officers
were
very
concerned
with
the
idea
that
at
this
very
moment
either
mrs.
vale
or
brother
james
or
donald’s
girlfriend
who
traveled
around
with
him
to
various
addresses
was
right
at
that
very
time
getting
either
hiding
the
narcotics,
taking
him
out
the
backdoor,
disposing
of
them
in
some
way.
so,
as
louisiana
sees
it.
there
was
the
dilemma
faced
by
these
officers
and
they
either
had
to
seize
this
evidence
right
now
or
not
at
all
because
i
know
yesterday
the
court
was
opposing
the
problem
of
whether
there
were
any
alternatives
to
an
immediate
warrantless
search
and
as
a
practical
matter
it’s
louisiana’s
position
that
there
were
no
practical
alternatives
because
of
the
time
involved
in
getting
a
warrant
and
the
fact
that
--
one
thing
is
clear,
not
knowing
whether
anyone
was
in
the
house
or
not,
the
officers
had
to
enter
the
house
and
search
it
fairly
thoroughly
to
find
out
even
if
whether
someone
else
was
in
the
house
because
confederates
often
hide
in
closets
and
under
beds
as
this
court
knows
and
it
was
only
about
fairly
thorough
search
of
the
house
that
the
officers
could
even
determine
that
there
was
no
one
in
the
house
to
dispose
--
ms.
louise
korns
no
that’s
perfectly
true,
that’s
right.
but
they
had
to
make
a
search
of
the
house
in
fair
detail
to
be
sure
that
no
one
was
hiding
in
the
house,
in
closets,
in
rooms,
and
so
forth
and
under
beds.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
actually
i
think
the
question
of
firearms
i
guess
is
always
lurking
in
the
background
but
with
what
narcotics
addicts
generally,
i
don’t
think
weapons
are
generally
involved
in
these
crimes.
i
think
mostly
it’s
the
police
officers
they're
concerned
and
the
record
here
shows
with
getting
to
the
evidence
before
the
people
involved
with
the
narcotics
can
get
rid
of
it
just
like
in
this
case,
saucier
got
rid
of
the
narcotics
which
vale
had
just
sold
in
by
swallowing.
and
the
officers,
the
record
here
show
that
they
rushed
first
to
the
bathroom
to
listen
for
the
sound
of
running
water
when
they
approached,
they
testified
that
and
looked
around
in
the
toilet
bowl
and
so
forth
because
looked
in
the
basin
and
in
any
drain
like
that
where
narcotics
could
be
disposed
off.
so,
really
i
think
--
i
don’t
think
i
will
be
frank
and
say
no
i
don’t
think
the
officers
were
afraid
that
they’d
be
shot
at
from
the
house
or
anything.
i
think
their
primary
and
only
purpose
was
to
try
to
get
hold
of
this
narcotics
which
they
were
convinced
donald
vale,
they
just
seen
him
sell
but
because
of
saucier
swallowing
that
evidence
they
--
because
that
would
have
been
there
right
there
if
saucier
didn’t
swallow
the
evidence
and
arrested
vale
for
this
present
narcotics
sale
and
the
saucier
had
the
evidence
that
would’ve
been
it.
ms.
louise
korns
your
honor,
it
didn’t
even
come
up
there
is
--
ms.
louise
korns
and
that's
right,
there
is
no
testimony
at
all
on
that
subject
and
really
i
don’t
think
it
--
you
know
was
a
matter
in
which
anyone
on
either
the
defense
or
the
accuse
were
interested
at
the
trial
of
this
case
for
instance
only
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
sure
i
mean
i
think
they
--
i
don’t
think
there
is
concerned
no
with
guns
for
narcotics
addicts
as
they
also
for
say
burglary
suspects
are
people
who
commit
crimes
of
violence.
there's
no
doubt
about
it
when
they
--
when
they
frisked
down
vale
and
saucier.
when
they
first
arrested
them,
they
--
i
think
the
record
will
show
maybe
that
they
were
frisking
for
possibility
of
weapons
or
narcotics,
but
they
did
testify
that
they
wanted
to
go
in
that
house
because
they
were
sure
that
that's
where
the
hoard
of
narcotics
were.
ms.
louise
korns
that’s
right,
the
thing
is
that
they
didn’t
know
that
though
mr.
justice
stewart
until
they
had
gone
all
through
the
house
to
be
sure
because
they
knew
that
mrs.
vale
and
james
live
there
and
then
of
course
when
mrs.
vale
and
james
showed
up
within
about
five
minutes
after
the
officers
got
in
the
house
has
but
before
they’d
found
the
narcotics.
then,
the
only
other
place
they
could’ve
been
hiding
in
there
was
donald’s
girlfriend,
but
i
think
by
that
time
they’d
run
through
the
house
enough
to
be
sure
that
nobody
was
in
the
house.
but
they
didn’t
know
this
until
they
got
in.
ms.
louise
korns
the
fact
is
there
was
nobody,
but
they
have
no
way
of
knowing
this.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
i
say
the
record
shows
that
they
positively
knew
that
somebody
could
be
there.
now,
the
state
of
louisiana
just
wants
to
oppose
to
this
court
the
practical
difficulties
involved
if
the
police
were
going
to
get
a
warrant
to
search
for
this
narcotic
evidence.
as
i
say,
they
first
had
to
get
into
the
house
to
be
sure
no
one
was
hiding
in
there
or
would’ve
done
no
good
to
put
a
cord
in
around
the
house
without
first
finding
out
there
was
nobody
in
it.
having
found
out
that
the
only
two
people
on
it
were
james
and
mrs.
vale
then
they
would’ve
had
to
call
in
other
police
officers
to
keep
these
people
under
surveillance.
their
movements
under
complete
surveillance
are
to
keep
--
take
them
out
of
the
house
during
the
time
in
which
they
took
them
to
get
a
search
warrant.
and
in
owing
to
perish
at
least,
search
warrant
issued
by
criminal
district
court
judges
and
at
least
one
of
these
arresting
officers
because
only
they
three
knew
the
facts
would’ve
had
to
go
back
to
the
police
bureau
and
typed
up
the
affidavit.
and
you
have
to
type
up
an
affidavit
for
a
search
warrant
in
about
six
duplicates.
police
officers
don’t
reduce
probable
cause
to
writing
with
the
greatest
to
speed.
it’s
been
my
experience
these
men
often
have
all
kind
of
reasons
why
they
do
things.
they're
not
the
most
articulate
people
in
the
world
particularly
when
they
have
to
write
down
and
often
in
the
past
they
used
to
put
down
too
little
but
now
because
court
decisions
throw
out
worst
they
put
down
much
too
much.
they
put
down
everything
they’ve
seen
and
gone
and
so
forth
and
so
it
runs
on
for
pages.
then,
they’ve
got
to
find
the
judge
to
study
this
warrant
and
find
out
whether
it’s
stays
probable
cause
and
if
he’s
in
his
court
or
in
his
chambers
and
busy
they
have
to
wait,
and
then
present
it
to
him
and
if
he’s
going
home
then
they
have
to
track
him
down
and
find
him
and
i
think
at
the
best
with
everything
going
in
your
favor
takes
at
least
three
hours
to
process
a
search
warrant.
and
often
it
takes
a
whole
day
before
you
can
get
the
whole
thing
typed
up
and
the
judge
satisfied
and
signed
and
back
and
served
the
copies.
you
have
to
give
one
to
another
clerk’s
office
so
they’ll
know
what
property
they’re
going
to
seize
and
then
make
returns
and
so
forth.
so
really
you
know
these
the
officers,
the
record
here
shows
that
the
officers
approached
donald
vale’s
house
around
noon
with
luck
they
could
very
well
have
been
back
with
the
search
warrant
later
to
that
afternoon.
but
if
any
little
interference
had
come
up
for
some
reason
or
another
they
might
not
have
been
back
until
the
next
day
and
unless
they
had
kept
these
people
under
close
surveillance,
they
would’ve
been
any
narcotics
evidence
left
in
that
house
when
they
got
back.
and
also
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
in
the
first
place
they
didn’t
know
that
they
hadn't
been
seen
by
the
vales
and
actually
probably
knew
there
were
people
in
the
house
watching
everything
they
did
or
they
might
very
well
have
been
neighbors
watching
what
they
did.
we
don’t
know
about
that
but
these
things
get
around
very
quickly
among
people
of
this
type.
not
only
that
mrs.
vale
and
james
came
back
to
the
house
within
minutes
after
the
police
officers
got
in
to
house.
so
therefore,
but
they
might’ve
very
well
have
gotten
back
to
the
house
seeing
the
police
officers
put
saucier
and
donald
into
the
cars.
i
mean,
this
--
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
your
honor.
a
residential
small
sort
of
shotgun
house
is
close
to
each
other.
ms.
louise
korns
yes.
ms.
louise
korns
there
wasn’t
backdoor
entrance
leading
into
the
yard.
this
is
clear
because
the
record
shows
that
the
officer
--
one
of
the
officers
run
out
the
backdoor
and
looked
in
the
yard
and
see
if
there
was
any
disposable
evidence.
ms.
louise
korns
that’s
right
but
mr.
justice
--
ms.
louise
korns
couldn’t
have
done
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
one
policeman
couldn’t
drive
two
prisoners
and
that
would
be
bad
security.
you
have
to
at
least
to
have
two
police
officers
in
the
car
with
two
prisoners.
one
police
officer
is
so
to
drive
and
one
to
watch
the
prisoners.
ms.
louise
korns
there's
no
doubt
about
it
they
could
--
ms.
louise
korns
no,
i
don’t
believe
sir.
i
think
the
record
shows
that
all
of
them
went
in.
all
the
police
officers
and
donald
vale
and
saucier
and
that
then
mrs.
vale
and
james
arrived.
ms.
louise
korns
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
there’s
no
doubt
about
they
couldn’t.
ms.
louise
korns
no
doubt
about
it.
the
louisiana
did
say
they
could’ve
--
position
as
this
would
have
taken
a
long
time
and
it
would
have
interfered
with
the
liberty
of
mrs.
vale
and
james
vale
inordinately?
and
supposing
in
the
end
they
haven’t
found
any?
ms.
louise
korns
they
only
arrested
him
after
they
found
the
narcotic
evidence.
ms.
louise
korns
no,
well
they
arrested
him
for
possession
of
narcotics
mr.
justice
marshall
after
they
had
searched
the
house
and
found
the
narcotics
in
his
bedroom
as
his
mother
said.
but
we’re
talking
about
the
preliminary
situation
when
the
officers
had
just
arrested
donald
and
saucier
right
outside
the
house
engaged
in
a
narcotic
transaction
and
then
the
whole
issue
they
had
to
decide
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
was
whether
to
go
in
that
house
and
look
for
those
narcotics.
they
didn’t
know
whether
anyone
was
in
the
house
or
not.
that’s
the
situation
we
have
right
there.
they
have
to
go
in
the
house
to
see
if
anyone
was
there.
now,
there's
no
doubt
it
we
can
see
that
they
could’ve
gone
in
and
look
around
and
seen
no
one
was
there
then
they
could’ve
called
other
police,
placed
guards
on
the
house
and
gone
out
and
got
a
warrant.
this
would’ve
take
in
anywhere
from
three
hours
to
the
next
day.
we
concede
that.
ms.
louise
korns
no,
mr.
justice
white
here
of
course
we’re
relying
on
the
settled
decisions
of
this
court
that
following
a
valid
arrest
the
police
can
make
a
search
incident
to
that
arrest
at
the
place
of
the
arrest.
and
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
the
place
was
extended
a
little
too
far
as
we
said
because
donald
vale
was
arrested
at
the
front
door
of
his
house.
ms.
louise
korns
shipley,
we
distinguish
very
clearly.
in
that
--
in
shipley
for
instance
the
only
similarity
between
this
case
and
shipley
is
that
both
arrests
took
place
outside
the
house
but
unlike
this
case
in
shipley,
the
police
officers
weren’t
watching
and
didn’t
see
shipley
going
in
and
out
of
his
house
committing
a
crime.
shipley
had
committed
that
crime
several
days
before
and
they
were
just
at
his
house
to
arrest
him
for
this
crime
they’ve
heard
about.
secondly,
shipley
didn’t
involve
narcotics
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
right.
the
thing
is
that
i
see
it
shipley
then
hour
of
that
they
could’ve
got
a
search
warrant
and
shipley
as
this
court
pointed
out
they
stake
--
they
first
went
into
the
house
and
shipley
and
they
already
eluded
shipley’s
associates
to
the
fact
that
they
went
search
because
his
wife
was
in
there.
they
already
knew
then
they
went
back
out
and
stake
to
that.
now
during
the
stakeout
they
could’ve
which
went
on
for
several
hours,
they
certainly
could’ve
gotten
a
warrant.
it
wasn’t
the
emergency
situation
which
here
this
emergency
situation
just
developed
in
front
of
the
officers
as
they
went
to
serve
these
two
old
alias
capiases.
they
were
presented
with
this
emergency
situation
completely
unforeseen,
the
sale
took
place
in
front
of
there
eyes.
then
what
they
were
going
to
do
about
trying
to
get
that
evidence
which
they
knew
was
in
that
house.
it
all
happened
just
like
that.
ms.
louise
korns
not
at
all,
not
only
that
but
the
house
wouldn’t
be
the
place
of
the
arrest
here
it’s
true
that
the
arrest
took
place
at
the
front
steps
of
the
house
but
remember
this,
donald
vale
had
gone
into
the
house
when
saucier
had
first
given
him
let
him
know
he
want
a
narcotics
had
come
out
of
the
house,
leaving
the
door
open,
looking
up
and
down.
when
vale
saw
the
police
officers
approached
his
house
and
arrest
him
right
there
at
the
car,
he
turned
around
and
started
toward
the
front
door
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
the
police
officer
had
been
aware
of
all
the
decisions
which
police
officers
aren’t.
if
i've
been
there
i
would
just
wait
that
the
minute
let
donald
walk
back
into
his
house
and
then
when
a
few
steps
he
would’ve
been
inside
the
house
and
you
say,
alright
--
alright,
although
under
chimel
i
guess
you
would’ve
had
to
lame
walk
all
the
way
back
to
the
closest.
but
anyway,
nevertheless,
it
was
so
clearly
a
question
of
the
arrest
taking
place
at
the
scene
you
know
of
the
search
talking
place
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
immediately
contemporaneous
with
the
crime.
that
we
think
these
are
the
facts
at
which
governed
this
case
and
would
clearly
distinguish
an
arrest
which
took
place
on
the
street
for
instance.
there,
the
place
of
the
arrest
would
be
the
street
and
there
the
officers
would
only
look
around
the
feet
of
the
accused
for
instance.
now,
the
state
of
louisiana
feels
that
this
emergency
situation
is
so
similar
to
the
one
that
existed
to
schmerber
for
instance
or
in
warden
versus
hayden
and
we
can't
see
the
difference.
of
course
in
schmerber
it
involved
a
blood
sample
and
in
warden
versus
hayden
it
involved
burglary
--
fruits
of
the
burglary.
but
nevertheless,
the
basic
situation
is
the
same.
the
police
officers
are
faced
with
a
situation
in
which
they’ve
got
to
act
quickly
or
the
evidence
they
are
going
to
seize
is
not
going
to
be
there
anymore.
they're
faced
with
this
situation
and
narcotic
evidence
disappears
just
as
rapidly
as
does
alcohol
in
the
blood.
not
only
that,
i’d
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
if
police
officers
can't
make
searches
for
narcotics
such
as
existed
in
the
present
case,
they
can't
really
ever
seize
this
evidence
because
how
would
they
able
to
get
a
search
warrant
for
instance
although
--
no,
let's
say
the
police
officer
is
like
in
the
present
case
knew
that
donald
vale
was
operating
from
four
or
five
different
addresses.
now,
supposing
they
had
gone
to
--
had
made
out
a
search
warrant
about
six
of
them,
four
or
five
addresses,
one
for
his
car,
one
for
his
person.
all
simultaneous
and
taking
him
to
a
criminal
district
court
judge
all
residing
probable
cause
to
believe
that
this
particular
warrant
were
discovered
would
turn
out
narcotics.
the
judges
signed
them
all
then
he
had
gone
around
and
executed
all
these
warrants
and
one
of
them
that
had
found
narcotics.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
accused,
all
he
had
to
do
is
go
and
say,
how
could
you
have
probable
cause
for
this
one
warrant
when
you
sign
--
when
you
got
that
five
others
and
you
really
didn’t
know
where
it
was
did
you
and
no
you
didn’t.
and
how
do
you
know
where
the
narcotic
evidence
is
in
the
case
like
this
where
this
guy
--
these
people
are
very
smart
and
they
jump
around
and
they
change
where
they
keep
the
narcotic
hoard
on
the
person
and
the
car
in
different
place.
so,
how
would
the
police
ever
get?
ms.
louise
korns
no,
not
connecting
houses
your
honor.
donald
vale,
this
was
his
mother
and
brother’s
house.
he
had
an
apartment
of
his
own,
he
sometimes
stays
in
his
girlfriend’s
apartment
or
friend’s
apartment
operated
of
an
automobile
but
he’s
an
intelligent
man
enough
to
know
that
if
he
doesn’t
keep
moving
and
keep
his
narcotic
stock
quickly
shifting
around
then
it’s
going
to
get
seized.
now,
are
there
any
questions
of
court
would
like
to
ask?
ms.
louise
korns
thank
you,
your
honors.
