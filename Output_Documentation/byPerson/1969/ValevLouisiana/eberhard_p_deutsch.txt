pardon?[laughter]
it's
a
good
fortune
one
rarely
has.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellant
in
this
case
have
been
charged
in
a
proceeding
prior
to
the
one
here
at
issue
where
the
violation
of
the
state
narcotics
law.
in
the
course
of
that
proceeding,
his
bond
was
raised
on
the
prior
charge
and
three
policemen
with
capiases
for
his
arrest
in
connection
with
the
raised
bond
proceeded
to
what
was
believed
to
be
his
home
and
they
did
what
they
called
stick
themselves
out
and
hid
themselves
near
the
home
to
watch
it
for
some
reason.
they
said
they
want
to
be
sure
he
was
home
before
they
arrested
him,
i
didn't
quite
understand.
in
any
event,
while
they
were
waiting
in
hiding
an
automobile
drove
up
in
front
of
the
appellant's
home
and
it
was
driven
by
a
man
known
to
be
a
narcotics
addict.
the
driver
sounded
his
horn,
appellant
came
out
of
the
house,
talked
to
the
driver
from
the
other
side,
the
passenger
side
of
the
automobile,
returned
to
his
home,
came
out
again,
again
talked
to
the
driver
and
then
the
police
made
their
presence
known,
surrounded
the
automobile,
arrested
the
driver,
he
hastily
put
something
into
his
mouth
and
presumably
swallowed
it.
the
police
assumed
that
what
they
called
a
transaction
was
taking
place
and
the
appellant
himself
turned
and
started
to
walk
back
into
his
home,
they
stopped
him
and
arrested
him.
there
are
some
variations
in
the
testimony
about
how
far
he
was
from
the
door
of
his
home.
and
i
suppose,
at
one
point
i
think
it
said
he
was
at
the
front
steps.
at
another,
he
was
at
the
side
of
the
car
anywhere
from
15
to
30
feet
away.
in
any
event,
he
was
not
inside
the
house
when
arrested
and
i
think
the
best
way
to
put
it
was
that
he
was
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
his
home.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
the
door
was
presumably
opened,
yes.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
no,
i
don't
think
that's
him.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
yes,
i
think
he
had
left
it
open
when
he
came
out.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i'm
not
positive
of
that.
in
any
event,
they
were
all
arrested.
now,
the
police
have
no
search
warrant,
they
entered
the
home
over
the
protest
to
the
appellant.
advised
him
they
were
going
to
search
the
home
for
narcotics
and
advised
him
of
his
rights
presumably
in
the
usual
fashion.
a
few
minutes
later,
his
mother
and
brother
came
home
and
they
were
also
told
that
the
house
was
to
be
searched
and
protested,
at
least
the
mother
protested
and
they
proceeded
with
the
search.
they
also
arrested
the
brother
and
in
the
course
of
the
search
in
a
closed
locker
in
a
bedroom
hidden
in
clothing
which
the
appellant
admitted
was
his,
they
found
narcotics
and
then
the
course
of
further
search
and
perhaps
his
--
even
helping
them
with
the
search
is
not
entirely
clear
they
found
some
narcotics
paraphernalia
in
the
bathroom.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
believe
it
had
three
rooms
perhaps
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
--
and
there's
no
kitchen
and
a
bathroom.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
all
one
--
one
floor.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
had
none
whatever.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
they
had
the
arrest
warrants
but
not
for
this
offense.
they
had
arrest
warrants
under
a
prior
charge
on
which
they
stick
themselves
up
presumably
to
find
him.
they
had
no
arrest
warrant
for
this
particular
offense.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
think
it
would
have
to
assume
that
although
it's
very
difficult
to
say
what
they
came
up
there
to
make
a
lawful
arrest
with
arrest
warrant.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
instead
of
doing
that,
they
hid
themselves
out
and
watched
what
they
presumed
what
they
called
a
transaction
taking
place.
then,
they
went
into
the
house
and
on
the
search
found
the
narcotics
following
which
they
charged
him
with
possession
of
narcotics.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
no
sir,
well
(voice
overlap)
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
court
has
confined
me
to
the
matter
of
search
and
seizure.
so
that
they
charged
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
would
have
to
assume
that.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
i
so
understand
the
law
exactly.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
would
say
this
was
a
lawful
arrest
on
the
basis
of
the
offense
which
they
believed
to
have
seen
taking
place
and
that
thereafter
they
found
the
evidence
on
the
basis
of
which
they
made
the
charge
on
which
they
had
arrested
him.
now,
that
brought
us
--
i
suppose
as
i
come
to
it
on
the
record
which
is
all
that
i
have
under
all
service.
now,
he
had
counsel
appointed
for
him.
he
moved
to
suppress
this
evidence
in
a
separate
sort
of
proceeding
which
i
understand
is
typical
in
this
type
of
case.
he
also
objected
according
to
the
record
to
the
introduction
of
the
evidence
on
the
ground
that
it
was
obtained
by
an
unconstitutional
search
and
seizure.
he
pleaded
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment.
the
case
was
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
and
they
cited
the
statute,
the
arrest
statute
which
permits
the
officers
to
take
from
the
person
arrested
all
weapons
and
incriminating
articles
which
he
may
have
about
his
person.
they
cited
that
statute
in
justification
of
the
search
and
held
that
there
was
no
violation
of
the
cited
constitutional
provisions.
i
think
that
is
a
fair
statement
of
the
fact
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
don't
know,
sir.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
oh!
i
think
from
practical
purposes.
it's
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
perhaps,
but
i
don't
think
that's
involved
in
this
situation.
in
any
event,
this
says
in
so
many
words
from
the
person
arrested
all
weapons
at
which
he
may
have
about
his
person.
now,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
that
means
on
his
person,
i
may
be
stretching
it.
i
think
making
a
difference
on
a
word
of
that
sort.
in
any
event,
is
going
too
far
in
statutory
transaction.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
do
not
take
that
position.
now,
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
don't
think
that's
really
important.
he
admitted
the
clothing
was
his.
his
mother
denied
it
was
his
home.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
and
they
had
arrested
him
at
other
premises
on
pereira
case
but
i
can't
quite
see
the
relevance
of
that
issue
which
did
arise
in
the
trial
court.
and
the
trial
judge
only
said
that
he
knew
the
cases
of
this
court
where
the
other
way
but
he
didn't
propose
to
follow
(voice
overlap)
the
law.--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
don't
think
it's
really
relevant.
he
admitted
the
clothing
was
his.
he
admitted
the
narcotics
were
taken
from
his
clothing.
he
never
disputed
that
and
while
his
mother
said
he
doesn't
live
here,
it's
his
brother
who
lives
here
and
they
were
both
arrested,
both
tried.
i
don't
think
that
that's
really
at
issue
at
this
point.
now,
some
200
years
ago
or
more,
william
pitt,
the
elder
in
the
house
of
commons
or
the
earl
of
chatham
said,
“the
poorest
man
may
in
his
cottage
bid
defiance
to
all
the
forces
of
the
crown.
it
may
be
frail
roof,
may
leak,
the
wind
may
blow
through
it,
storm
and
the
rain
may
enter,
but
the
king
of
england
may
not
enter
all
of
his
forces
they
are
not
cross
the
threshold.”
that's
the
--
i
think
the
fundamental,
the
beginning
of
the
principle
which
we
not
have
embodied
in
the
fourth
amendment.
and
about
that
same
era,
the
lord
halifax
was
what
was
called
in
england
one
of
the
secretaries
of
state
issued
a
general
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
the
publishers
of
the
--
seditious
libel
stated
to
have
appeared
in
the
north
briton.
on
moving
about
the
so-called
messengers,
i
suppose
equivalent
to
constables
learned
that
it
was
john
wilkes
who
was
the
publisher
of
the
libel
and
under
that
same
general
warrant
namely
him
or
any
one
else
wilkes
was
arrested,
his
house
was
ransacked,
his
papers
were
seized.
they
called
the
blacksmiths
that
broke
the
locks
and
so
on
and
that
he
sued
the
messengers
and
others
and
lord
halifax
for
libel
or
a
rather
for
the
unlawful
issuance
of
unlawful
writ
and
the
seizure,
i
should
say.
he
recovered
1000
pounds
against
lord
halifax,
a
lesser
amounts
against
the
others
in
a
famous
opinion
written
at
that
time
by
lord
chief
justice
pratt
and
followed
very
shortly
within
the
same
few
years,
same
decade
by
the
famous
case
of
john
entick
who
had
been
arrested
and
his
papers
all
seized
under
a
somewhat
similar
warrant
except
that
it
main
him.
it
was
seditious
libel
in
the
british
freeholder
and
other
publication.
and
in
that
case,
lord
camden
held
that
if
this
practice
which
had
originated
in
the
star
chamber
should
be
sanctioned,
“the
secret
cabinets
and
bureaus
of
every
subject
in
this
kingdom
will
be
thrown
open
to
the
search
and
inspection
whenever
the
secretary
of
state
shall
see
fit
to
charge
or
even
suspect
a
person.
and
this
power
so
assumed
there's
an
execution
on
all
of
party's
papers,
his
house,
his
rifle;
his
most
valuable
papers
are
taken
out
and
so
on.
and
then
may
in
his
constitutional
history
of
england
that
antique
cases
are
uncovering
perhaps
100
pages
of
fine
print.
it's
a
long-winded
thing
but
may
in
this
constitutional
history
of
england
sums
it
up
that
with
the
unanimous
concurrence
of
lord
mansfield
and
the
other
judges
of
the
court,
this
eminent
magistrate
now
finally
condemned
this
dangerous
and
unconstitutional
practice.
now
very
interestingly,
just
before
those
two
famous
english
cases
arose,
a
situation
arose
in
the
massachusetts
bay
colony.
the
british
ministry
set
orders
to
issue
general
warrants
which
they
were
called
writs
of
assistance
to
search
for
merchandise
on
which
the
duties
imposed
by
parliament
and
not
been
paid.
there
were
no
names,
there
were
no
places,
they
were
simply
suppose
to
go
out
and
it
gave
them
the
right
presumably
to
go
into
any
warehouse
shop
or
other
place
to
search
for
these
payments.
james
otis
was
the
attorney
general
of
the
colony
of
massachusetts
under
crown
appointment
at
that
time.
he
refused
to
support
the
writs,
resigned
his
office,
took
employment
on
the
other
side
without
fee
and
fought
the
issuance
of
these
writs
from
the
superior
court
of
massachusetts,
and
the
case
was
reported
actually
by
john
adams
whose
notes
of
the
case
are
published.
he
said
in
the
first
instance
that
the
court
expressed
great
doubts
of
the
legality
of
such
a
writ
and
of
the
authority
of
the
court
to
grant
it.
and
otis
said
in
his
argument,
“the
writ
prayed
for
in
this
petition,
being
general,
is
illegal.
it
is
a
power
that
places
the
liberty
of
every
man
in
the
hands
of
every
petty
officer.
”not
more
than
one
instance
he
went
on
and
he
talked
about
the
case
in
the
star
chamber.
now,
these
writs
were
never
issued
but
at
the
conclusion
of
his
notes,
john
adams
said,
american
independence
was
then
and
there
born.”
at
the
end
of
his
argument,
i
think
this
is
very
significant
language,
otis
said
that
special
writs
only
may
be
granted
on
oath
and
probable
suspicion.
the
acts
of
william
at
end
are
confined
to
this
sense
that
an
officer
should
show
probable
ground,
should
take
his
oath
of
it,
should
do
this
before
a
magistrate
and
that
such
magistrate
if
he
think
proper
should
issue
a
special
warrant
to
search
the
place.
that
language
is
almost
copied
for
about
25
years
later
into
the
fourth
amendment,
it's
perfectly
astounding.
now
closely,
that
language
that
he
used
in
the
argument
as
reported
by
john
adams
tracks
or
vice
versa
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.now,
if
this
court
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
yes,
sir.
the
state
makes
the
contention
that
this
was
one
of
those
hot
pursuit
cases
that
it
would
have
to
be
done
immediately
and
if
they
have
tried
to
go
for
a
warrant
while
the
evidence
would've
disappeared
as
its
usual
and
that
sort
of
thing
they
say,
they
flashed
it
down
the
toilet
and
all
that
sort
of
thing.
and
the
suspect
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
pardon?
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
not
in
this
case
but
i
do
it
in
principle
of
courts
of
that
type
of
things.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
oh!
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that.
i
think
that
there
were
three
officers;
two
of
them
could
have
stayed
there
while
the
other
one
get
a
warrant.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
yes,
sir.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
and
the
driver
of
the
car.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
the
only
one
there
was
the
mother.
they'd
have
no
trouble
watching
the
place.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
think
they
could
have.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
think
so,
either
without
unlawfully
invading
their
privacy
under
all
the
circumstances.
i
don't
think
that
would've
been
unlawful
invasion
to
wait
there
and
watch
the
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
can't
say
that,
no
sir.
no
sir,
they
would
--
they
might
have
to
wait
outside
but
if
he
had
done
it
on
the
basis
of
a
warrant
to
be
obtained,
he
might
have
gone
in
to
prevent
that,
yes
sir.
i
think
lawfully.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
think
what
he
could've
done
before
they
entered
with
the
three
officers.
could
have
sent
--
one
of
them
could
have
gone
back
for
a
warrant
and
the
other
two
could
then
said,
now
while
we
wait
for
the
warrant,
we'll
come
in
here
we
will
not
conduct
to
search,
we'll
simply
sit
here
and
make
sure
that
no
evidence
that
might
be
here
in
this
regard
would
disappear.
now,
there
is
another
principle
involved,
there
adds
a
question
as
to
whether
you
can
search
just
generally
in
the
hope
of
finding
evidence
even
under
a
search
warrant.
i
don't
have
that
situation,
i'm
not
prepared
to
discuss
it
but
i
know
there
is
the
question
that
even
with
the
search
warrant
they
couldn't
necessarily
have
gone
into
the
place
and
search
and
said,
we
hope
we
are
going
to
find
some
evidence
on
which
we
can
convict
you
on
this
arrest
that
we
made
on
a
suspicion
that
you
have
something
hidden
in
this
house
which
are
not
allowed
to
have.
but
that's
another
question.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
that's
--
i
mean
it's
another
question,
it's
a
hypothetical
question.
they
go
down
and
say,
we
saw
what
we
believe
to
be
a
transaction.
they
would
say
that
the
judge
presumably
under
oath
in
narcotics
transaction.
we
believe
there
are
narcotics
hidden
in
this
house.
we
asked
for
a
warrant
on
basis
of
which
to
search
for
these
narcotics
under
the
circumstances.
now,
that
would
bring
up
a
set
of
facts
that
does
not
exist
in
here
that
i
can't
possibly
--
i
can't
go
into
all
the
tangential
aspects
which
may
arise
under
that
type
of
hypothesis.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
i
understand
that
of
course
is
in
the
picture
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
it
didn't
happen
and
whether
they
could
have
done
it
or
not,
it
is
my
position
that
they
have
no
right
to
do
what
they
did.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
simply
sit
down
and
wait
for
the
warrant
to
come
by,
to
make
sure
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
of
course,
i
can't
quite
conceive
of
that.
i
think
the
police
said
(voice
overlap).
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
either
that
or
ask
the
person
to
stay
there
or
person
said
you
go
to
the
devil,
i
won't
do
it.
i
don't
know
what
would
happen
on
that
case.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
have
no
idea
but
i
should
(voice
overlap).
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
would
imagine
maybe
the
driving
from
this
area
would
take
15
to
20
minutes
to
go
to
a
court
house
and
15-20
minutes,
let's
say
within
an
hour
you
can
have
it,
but
not
certain.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
you'll
have
a
tremendous
advantage
over
me,
sir.
i've
never
tried
a
criminal
case
in
my
life
and
i
don't
know.
i
just
imagine
that
it
is
a
practical
matter
that
it
take
an
hour
or
so.
now,
i
could
be
very
well
be
wrong
(voice
overlap).
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i've
never
seen
a
search
warrant.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
what?
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
no.
no.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
it
was
in
broad
day
light
around
noon.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
oh!
yes.
as
this
case
has
said
on
the
course
of
its
opinion
especially
the
recent
ones
that
the
law
on
this
subject
has
moved
from
side
to
side
any
number
of
times,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
in
the
last
opinion
said
five
times
and
there
isn't
any
question
about
it
at
in
my
reading
of
all
of
this
law.
i
think
there
is
a
threat
of
an
effort
to
live
up
to
the
constitutional
history
to
which
i
have
referred.
i
think
it
is
well
summed
up
in
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
murphy
in
the
harris
case
which
has
since
been
overruled
and
also
in
his
majority
opinion
in
the
trubiano
(ph)
case
involving
the
steals.
of
course
i
am
not
here
to
argue
the
question
of
retroactivity
of
the
chimel
case
decided
some
later
10
months
ago.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
do
so.
i
know
that
mr.
justice
harlan's
statement
and
one
of
the
other
cases
that
it
should
be
applied
the
case
is
still
subject
to
direct
review
by
this
court
but
i
have
not
approached
the
matter
from
that
point
of
view.
i
might
refer
for
a
moment
to
the
case
of
james
versus
louisiana
in
which
a
man
was
arrested
two
blocks
from
his
house,
and
this
court
held
in
a
unanimous
decision
per
curiam
that
his
home
could
not
be
searched
under
those
circumstances
without
a
warrant.
i
might
mention
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
no,
i'd
go
further
shipley
which
is
the
one
you
decided
on
the
same
day
as
the
chimel
case.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
just
can't
see
any
difference
and
the
only
reason
i've
gone
–
i'm
putting
my
case
on
the
basis
on
which
i
have
especially
on
this
oral
argument
is
that
i
can't
understand
why
you
would
ask
for
a
hearing.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
i
go
further
than
that,
exactly
the
same
as
the
chimel
case.
its
open
it
involves
a
similar
situation
except
it
goes
back
one
step
because
he
wasn't
in
the
home
on
arrest.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
shipley
and
van
cleef.
but
shipley
is
very
closely
on
point
because
he
was
arrested
that
he
was
getting
out
of
his
automobile
near
his
home.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
no,
it
was
decided
on
law
prior
to
the
chimel.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
chimel
or
chimel.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
exactly
and
i
just
want
to
mention
if
i
may
as
a
little
interesting
sidelight
that
the
james
case
i
have
talked
about
james
otis
who
was
the
father
of
the
fourth
amendment.
this
man's
name
was
otis,
james.
now,
in
shipley,
very
frankly
when
this
court
said
not
referring
to
the
chimel
case
at
all,
the
constitution
has
never
been
construed
and
that
statement
i
confine
--
i
cannot
find
it
any
exception.
i
can't
find
that
that's
wrong.
by
this
court
to
claim
to
allow
the
police
in
the
absence
of
an
emergency
to
arrest
the
person
outside
his
home
and
then
take
him
inside
for
the
purpose
of
conducting
a
warrantless
search
on
the
contrary
it
has
always
been
assumed
that
once
house
cannot
lawfully
be
search
without
a
search
warrant
except
as
an
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
therein.
now,
that's
a
per
curiam
decision.
the
statement
as
i
said,
the
position
of
the
state
in
this
court
at
any
rate
is
that
this
was
an
effect
a
hot
pursuit,
and
that
this
wasn't
really
a
general
search
that
it
last
to
only
two
or
three
minutes.
now,
i
dispute
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
the
record
and
i'll
take
only
a
moment
to
mention
that.
the
brief
of
the
state
says
that
approximately
a
minute
or
two
no
more
than
three
minutes
--
oh,
i'm
sorry
that's
the
transcript.
within
minutes
says
the
brief
after
entering
the
house,
the
officers
found
the
heroin
and
dilaudid
and
so
on.
now,
what
and
the
reference
there
is
to
page
12
of
the
transcript,
the
appendix
which
says,
“that
approximately
a
minute
or
two
no
more
than
three
minutes
officer
laumann
had
walked
into
the
back
bedroom
and
while
i
was
standing
in
the
front
room,
james
vale
and
his
mother
came
into
the
front
room
of
the
house.
at
this
time,
i
identified
myself
to
them
and
told
them
donald
vale
was
under
arrest
and
we
were
going
to
conduct
a
search
of
the
house.”
that's
where
the
two
or
three
minutes
came
in.
he
told
them
they
were
going
to
search.
we
simply
submit
and
may
it
please
the
court,
that
appellant
was
convicted
on
the
basis
of
evidence
obtained
in
violation
of
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment.
that
conviction
was
affirmed
actually
here
be
reversed.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
certainly.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
yes,
sir.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
that
could
be
the
only
question
actually.
the
state
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
one
of
jurisdiction
and
the
court
postponed
that
to
the
merit.
the
state
has
not
raised
the
question
of
jurisdiction
in
its
brief
to
this
court.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
you
see
the
state
supreme
court
cited
the
statute
permitting
the
search
on
making
arrest
and
then
held
not
very
specifically
or
clearly
that
there
was
nothing
violated
of
the
constitution
in
the
arrest
made
under
that
--
and
the
search
made
under
that
statute
which
i
construe
to
mean
that
they
held
that
the
statute
as
so
applied
does
not
violate
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment.
if
so,
this
is
a
good
appeal
if
not
it
belongs
here
on
cert
in
any
event.
that
would
be
my
construction.
they
held
the
statute
not
to
be
violated.
the
statute
is
so
applied
not
to
be
violated
with
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
mr.
chief
justice
three
or
four
observations
in
connection
perhaps
primarily
with
the
discussion
yesterday.
i
did
make
inquiry
mr.
justice
white
is
to
how
long
it
would
take
to
get
a
search
warrant
because
i
have
no
idea
of
my
own.
i
was
told
that
the
ordinary
practice
of
a
situation
of
that
sort
is
for
one
of
the
officers
to
telephone
that
they're
coming
down,
give
the
appropriate
information,
and
get
the
necessary
papers
ready
while
they
were
on
their
way
back
within
the
day
time
while
courts
are
opened.
they
--
it
does
take
only
about
30
minutes
to
prepare
the
necessary
papers
and
add
to
that
the
time
going
in
and
coming
back
out
should
not
be
more
than
one
hour
for
whatever
that’s
worth.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
in
the
day
time,
yes
sir.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
there's
no
question
about
that
that
is
the
optimum
situation.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i'm
not
at
all
certain
mr.
chief
justice
that
a
search
warrant
would
be
issued
in
such
a
case
on
the
type
of
evidence
they
had.
now,
the
statement
is
made
--
has
been
made
that
there
was
a
narcotics
transaction
which
have
taken
place.
actually
no
one
saw
that,
they
saw
what
they
thought
was
a
narcotics
transaction.
there
was
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i'm
sure
that
on
that
alone,
they
would
never
get
a
conviction
at
least
i
assume
that
from
reading
the
newspapers.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
about
probable
cause
and
i
plead
i
don’t
dispute
that.
i
don’t
dispute
the
probable
cause.
i
made
the
statement
that
he
has
that
i
didn’t
know
never
seen
a
search
warrant
so
i
couldn’t
very
well
speak
about
it.
in
the
course
of
checking
on
that
i
find
that
with
one
exception
in
the
history
of
this
court
at
least
to
modern
history
no
writ
of
certiorari
has
ever
been
issued
out
to
this
court
and
no
one
has
ever
seen
one
where
used
to
using
this
terms
without
really
realizing
what
they
are.
i
assume
the
judge
to
this
court
had.
i
was
asked
yesterday
too
about
the
question
as
to
why
a
hearing
should
be
granted
in
this
case
and
it
should
not
have
been
handled
summarily.
i
assume
that
was
because
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
white
while
concurring
in
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
the
two
prior
case
has
decided
in
june
of
last
year
said
that
they
dissented
from
a
summary
dismissed
--
summary
reversal
of
those
cases
without
a
hearing.
and
that
under
those
circumstances
it
was
thought
best
to
grant
a
hearing
in
one
case
for
the
trial.
now,
we
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
yes
sir,
von
cleef
and
shipley,
that’s
right.
now,
we
rely
of
course
on
agnello,
james
and
shipley
in
which
and
the
statement
finally
made
in
shipley
that
no
warrant
has
ever
been
--
had
no
search
has
ever
been
held
to
be
valid
when
the
arrest
was
made
outside
the
premises
in
which
the
search
took
place.
we
submit
the
case.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i'm
very
grateful
for
the
privilege
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
pardon?[laughter]
it's
a
good
fortune
one
rarely
has.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellant
in
this
case
have
been
charged
in
a
proceeding
prior
to
the
one
here
at
issue
where
the
violation
of
the
state
narcotics
law.
in
the
course
of
that
proceeding,
his
bond
was
raised
on
the
prior
charge
and
three
policemen
with
capiases
for
his
arrest
in
connection
with
the
raised
bond
proceeded
to
what
was
believed
to
be
his
home
and
they
did
what
they
called
stick
themselves
out
and
hid
themselves
near
the
home
to
watch
it
for
some
reason.
they
said
they
want
to
be
sure
he
was
home
before
they
arrested
him,
i
didn't
quite
understand.
in
any
event,
while
they
were
waiting
in
hiding
an
automobile
drove
up
in
front
of
the
appellant's
home
and
it
was
driven
by
a
man
known
to
be
a
narcotics
addict.
the
driver
sounded
his
horn,
appellant
came
out
of
the
house,
talked
to
the
driver
from
the
other
side,
the
passenger
side
of
the
automobile,
returned
to
his
home,
came
out
again,
again
talked
to
the
driver
and
then
the
police
made
their
presence
known,
surrounded
the
automobile,
arrested
the
driver,
he
hastily
put
something
into
his
mouth
and
presumably
swallowed
it.
the
police
assumed
that
what
they
called
a
transaction
was
taking
place
and
the
appellant
himself
turned
and
started
to
walk
back
into
his
home,
they
stopped
him
and
arrested
him.
there
are
some
variations
in
the
testimony
about
how
far
he
was
from
the
door
of
his
home.
and
i
suppose,
at
one
point
i
think
it
said
he
was
at
the
front
steps.
at
another,
he
was
at
the
side
of
the
car
anywhere
from
15
to
30
feet
away.
in
any
event,
he
was
not
inside
the
house
when
arrested
and
i
think
the
best
way
to
put
it
was
that
he
was
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
his
home.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
the
door
was
presumably
opened,
yes.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
no,
i
don't
think
that's
him.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
yes,
i
think
he
had
left
it
open
when
he
came
out.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i'm
not
positive
of
that.
in
any
event,
they
were
all
arrested.
now,
the
police
have
no
search
warrant,
they
entered
the
home
over
the
protest
to
the
appellant.
advised
him
they
were
going
to
search
the
home
for
narcotics
and
advised
him
of
his
rights
presumably
in
the
usual
fashion.
a
few
minutes
later,
his
mother
and
brother
came
home
and
they
were
also
told
that
the
house
was
to
be
searched
and
protested,
at
least
the
mother
protested
and
they
proceeded
with
the
search.
they
also
arrested
the
brother
and
in
the
course
of
the
search
in
a
closed
locker
in
a
bedroom
hidden
in
clothing
which
the
appellant
admitted
was
his,
they
found
narcotics
and
then
the
course
of
further
search
and
perhaps
his
--
even
helping
them
with
the
search
is
not
entirely
clear
they
found
some
narcotics
paraphernalia
in
the
bathroom.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
believe
it
had
three
rooms
perhaps
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
--
and
there's
no
kitchen
and
a
bathroom.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
all
one
--
one
floor.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
had
none
whatever.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
they
had
the
arrest
warrants
but
not
for
this
offense.
they
had
arrest
warrants
under
a
prior
charge
on
which
they
stick
themselves
up
presumably
to
find
him.
they
had
no
arrest
warrant
for
this
particular
offense.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
think
it
would
have
to
assume
that
although
it's
very
difficult
to
say
what
they
came
up
there
to
make
a
lawful
arrest
with
arrest
warrant.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
instead
of
doing
that,
they
hid
themselves
out
and
watched
what
they
presumed
what
they
called
a
transaction
taking
place.
then,
they
went
into
the
house
and
on
the
search
found
the
narcotics
following
which
they
charged
him
with
possession
of
narcotics.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
no
sir,
well
(voice
overlap)
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
court
has
confined
me
to
the
matter
of
search
and
seizure.
so
that
they
charged
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
would
have
to
assume
that.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
i
so
understand
the
law
exactly.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
would
say
this
was
a
lawful
arrest
on
the
basis
of
the
offense
which
they
believed
to
have
seen
taking
place
and
that
thereafter
they
found
the
evidence
on
the
basis
of
which
they
made
the
charge
on
which
they
had
arrested
him.
now,
that
brought
us
--
i
suppose
as
i
come
to
it
on
the
record
which
is
all
that
i
have
under
all
service.
now,
he
had
counsel
appointed
for
him.
he
moved
to
suppress
this
evidence
in
a
separate
sort
of
proceeding
which
i
understand
is
typical
in
this
type
of
case.
he
also
objected
according
to
the
record
to
the
introduction
of
the
evidence
on
the
ground
that
it
was
obtained
by
an
unconstitutional
search
and
seizure.
he
pleaded
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment.
the
case
was
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
and
they
cited
the
statute,
the
arrest
statute
which
permits
the
officers
to
take
from
the
person
arrested
all
weapons
and
incriminating
articles
which
he
may
have
about
his
person.
they
cited
that
statute
in
justification
of
the
search
and
held
that
there
was
no
violation
of
the
cited
constitutional
provisions.
i
think
that
is
a
fair
statement
of
the
fact
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
don't
know,
sir.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
oh!
i
think
from
practical
purposes.
it's
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
perhaps,
but
i
don't
think
that's
involved
in
this
situation.
in
any
event,
this
says
in
so
many
words
from
the
person
arrested
all
weapons
at
which
he
may
have
about
his
person.
now,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
that
means
on
his
person,
i
may
be
stretching
it.
i
think
making
a
difference
on
a
word
of
that
sort.
in
any
event,
is
going
too
far
in
statutory
transaction.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
do
not
take
that
position.
now,
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
don't
think
that's
really
important.
he
admitted
the
clothing
was
his.
his
mother
denied
it
was
his
home.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
and
they
had
arrested
him
at
other
premises
on
pereira
case
but
i
can't
quite
see
the
relevance
of
that
issue
which
did
arise
in
the
trial
court.
and
the
trial
judge
only
said
that
he
knew
the
cases
of
this
court
where
the
other
way
but
he
didn't
propose
to
follow
(voice
overlap)
the
law.--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
don't
think
it's
really
relevant.
he
admitted
the
clothing
was
his.
he
admitted
the
narcotics
were
taken
from
his
clothing.
he
never
disputed
that
and
while
his
mother
said
he
doesn't
live
here,
it's
his
brother
who
lives
here
and
they
were
both
arrested,
both
tried.
i
don't
think
that
that's
really
at
issue
at
this
point.
now,
some
200
years
ago
or
more,
william
pitt,
the
elder
in
the
house
of
commons
or
the
earl
of
chatham
said,
“the
poorest
man
may
in
his
cottage
bid
defiance
to
all
the
forces
of
the
crown.
it
may
be
frail
roof,
may
leak,
the
wind
may
blow
through
it,
storm
and
the
rain
may
enter,
but
the
king
of
england
may
not
enter
all
of
his
forces
they
are
not
cross
the
threshold.”
that's
the
--
i
think
the
fundamental,
the
beginning
of
the
principle
which
we
not
have
embodied
in
the
fourth
amendment.
and
about
that
same
era,
the
lord
halifax
was
what
was
called
in
england
one
of
the
secretaries
of
state
issued
a
general
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
the
publishers
of
the
--
seditious
libel
stated
to
have
appeared
in
the
north
briton.
on
moving
about
the
so-called
messengers,
i
suppose
equivalent
to
constables
learned
that
it
was
john
wilkes
who
was
the
publisher
of
the
libel
and
under
that
same
general
warrant
namely
him
or
any
one
else
wilkes
was
arrested,
his
house
was
ransacked,
his
papers
were
seized.
they
called
the
blacksmiths
that
broke
the
locks
and
so
on
and
that
he
sued
the
messengers
and
others
and
lord
halifax
for
libel
or
a
rather
for
the
unlawful
issuance
of
unlawful
writ
and
the
seizure,
i
should
say.
he
recovered
1000
pounds
against
lord
halifax,
a
lesser
amounts
against
the
others
in
a
famous
opinion
written
at
that
time
by
lord
chief
justice
pratt
and
followed
very
shortly
within
the
same
few
years,
same
decade
by
the
famous
case
of
john
entick
who
had
been
arrested
and
his
papers
all
seized
under
a
somewhat
similar
warrant
except
that
it
main
him.
it
was
seditious
libel
in
the
british
freeholder
and
other
publication.
and
in
that
case,
lord
camden
held
that
if
this
practice
which
had
originated
in
the
star
chamber
should
be
sanctioned,
“the
secret
cabinets
and
bureaus
of
every
subject
in
this
kingdom
will
be
thrown
open
to
the
search
and
inspection
whenever
the
secretary
of
state
shall
see
fit
to
charge
or
even
suspect
a
person.
and
this
power
so
assumed
there's
an
execution
on
all
of
party's
papers,
his
house,
his
rifle;
his
most
valuable
papers
are
taken
out
and
so
on.
and
then
may
in
his
constitutional
history
of
england
that
antique
cases
are
uncovering
perhaps
100
pages
of
fine
print.
it's
a
long-winded
thing
but
may
in
this
constitutional
history
of
england
sums
it
up
that
with
the
unanimous
concurrence
of
lord
mansfield
and
the
other
judges
of
the
court,
this
eminent
magistrate
now
finally
condemned
this
dangerous
and
unconstitutional
practice.
now
very
interestingly,
just
before
those
two
famous
english
cases
arose,
a
situation
arose
in
the
massachusetts
bay
colony.
the
british
ministry
set
orders
to
issue
general
warrants
which
they
were
called
writs
of
assistance
to
search
for
merchandise
on
which
the
duties
imposed
by
parliament
and
not
been
paid.
there
were
no
names,
there
were
no
places,
they
were
simply
suppose
to
go
out
and
it
gave
them
the
right
presumably
to
go
into
any
warehouse
shop
or
other
place
to
search
for
these
payments.
james
otis
was
the
attorney
general
of
the
colony
of
massachusetts
under
crown
appointment
at
that
time.
he
refused
to
support
the
writs,
resigned
his
office,
took
employment
on
the
other
side
without
fee
and
fought
the
issuance
of
these
writs
from
the
superior
court
of
massachusetts,
and
the
case
was
reported
actually
by
john
adams
whose
notes
of
the
case
are
published.
he
said
in
the
first
instance
that
the
court
expressed
great
doubts
of
the
legality
of
such
a
writ
and
of
the
authority
of
the
court
to
grant
it.
and
otis
said
in
his
argument,
“the
writ
prayed
for
in
this
petition,
being
general,
is
illegal.
it
is
a
power
that
places
the
liberty
of
every
man
in
the
hands
of
every
petty
officer.
”not
more
than
one
instance
he
went
on
and
he
talked
about
the
case
in
the
star
chamber.
now,
these
writs
were
never
issued
but
at
the
conclusion
of
his
notes,
john
adams
said,
american
independence
was
then
and
there
born.”
at
the
end
of
his
argument,
i
think
this
is
very
significant
language,
otis
said
that
special
writs
only
may
be
granted
on
oath
and
probable
suspicion.
the
acts
of
william
at
end
are
confined
to
this
sense
that
an
officer
should
show
probable
ground,
should
take
his
oath
of
it,
should
do
this
before
a
magistrate
and
that
such
magistrate
if
he
think
proper
should
issue
a
special
warrant
to
search
the
place.
that
language
is
almost
copied
for
about
25
years
later
into
the
fourth
amendment,
it's
perfectly
astounding.
now
closely,
that
language
that
he
used
in
the
argument
as
reported
by
john
adams
tracks
or
vice
versa
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.now,
if
this
court
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
yes,
sir.
the
state
makes
the
contention
that
this
was
one
of
those
hot
pursuit
cases
that
it
would
have
to
be
done
immediately
and
if
they
have
tried
to
go
for
a
warrant
while
the
evidence
would've
disappeared
as
its
usual
and
that
sort
of
thing
they
say,
they
flashed
it
down
the
toilet
and
all
that
sort
of
thing.
and
the
suspect
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
pardon?
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
not
in
this
case
but
i
do
it
in
principle
of
courts
of
that
type
of
things.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
oh!
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that.
i
think
that
there
were
three
officers;
two
of
them
could
have
stayed
there
while
the
other
one
get
a
warrant.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
yes,
sir.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
and
the
driver
of
the
car.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
the
only
one
there
was
the
mother.
they'd
have
no
trouble
watching
the
place.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
think
they
could
have.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
think
so,
either
without
unlawfully
invading
their
privacy
under
all
the
circumstances.
i
don't
think
that
would've
been
unlawful
invasion
to
wait
there
and
watch
the
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
can't
say
that,
no
sir.
no
sir,
they
would
--
they
might
have
to
wait
outside
but
if
he
had
done
it
on
the
basis
of
a
warrant
to
be
obtained,
he
might
have
gone
in
to
prevent
that,
yes
sir.
i
think
lawfully.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
think
what
he
could've
done
before
they
entered
with
the
three
officers.
could
have
sent
--
one
of
them
could
have
gone
back
for
a
warrant
and
the
other
two
could
then
said,
now
while
we
wait
for
the
warrant,
we'll
come
in
here
we
will
not
conduct
to
search,
we'll
simply
sit
here
and
make
sure
that
no
evidence
that
might
be
here
in
this
regard
would
disappear.
now,
there
is
another
principle
involved,
there
adds
a
question
as
to
whether
you
can
search
just
generally
in
the
hope
of
finding
evidence
even
under
a
search
warrant.
i
don't
have
that
situation,
i'm
not
prepared
to
discuss
it
but
i
know
there
is
the
question
that
even
with
the
search
warrant
they
couldn't
necessarily
have
gone
into
the
place
and
search
and
said,
we
hope
we
are
going
to
find
some
evidence
on
which
we
can
convict
you
on
this
arrest
that
we
made
on
a
suspicion
that
you
have
something
hidden
in
this
house
which
are
not
allowed
to
have.
but
that's
another
question.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
that's
--
i
mean
it's
another
question,
it's
a
hypothetical
question.
they
go
down
and
say,
we
saw
what
we
believe
to
be
a
transaction.
they
would
say
that
the
judge
presumably
under
oath
in
narcotics
transaction.
we
believe
there
are
narcotics
hidden
in
this
house.
we
asked
for
a
warrant
on
basis
of
which
to
search
for
these
narcotics
under
the
circumstances.
now,
that
would
bring
up
a
set
of
facts
that
does
not
exist
in
here
that
i
can't
possibly
--
i
can't
go
into
all
the
tangential
aspects
which
may
arise
under
that
type
of
hypothesis.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
i
understand
that
of
course
is
in
the
picture
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
it
didn't
happen
and
whether
they
could
have
done
it
or
not,
it
is
my
position
that
they
have
no
right
to
do
what
they
did.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
simply
sit
down
and
wait
for
the
warrant
to
come
by,
to
make
sure
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
of
course,
i
can't
quite
conceive
of
that.
i
think
the
police
said
(voice
overlap).
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
either
that
or
ask
the
person
to
stay
there
or
person
said
you
go
to
the
devil,
i
won't
do
it.
i
don't
know
what
would
happen
on
that
case.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
have
no
idea
but
i
should
(voice
overlap).
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
would
imagine
maybe
the
driving
from
this
area
would
take
15
to
20
minutes
to
go
to
a
court
house
and
15-20
minutes,
let's
say
within
an
hour
you
can
have
it,
but
not
certain.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
you'll
have
a
tremendous
advantage
over
me,
sir.
i've
never
tried
a
criminal
case
in
my
life
and
i
don't
know.
i
just
imagine
that
it
is
a
practical
matter
that
it
take
an
hour
or
so.
now,
i
could
be
very
well
be
wrong
(voice
overlap).
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i've
never
seen
a
search
warrant.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
what?
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
no.
no.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
it
was
in
broad
day
light
around
noon.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
oh!
yes.
as
this
case
has
said
on
the
course
of
its
opinion
especially
the
recent
ones
that
the
law
on
this
subject
has
moved
from
side
to
side
any
number
of
times,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
in
the
last
opinion
said
five
times
and
there
isn't
any
question
about
it
at
in
my
reading
of
all
of
this
law.
i
think
there
is
a
threat
of
an
effort
to
live
up
to
the
constitutional
history
to
which
i
have
referred.
i
think
it
is
well
summed
up
in
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
murphy
in
the
harris
case
which
has
since
been
overruled
and
also
in
his
majority
opinion
in
the
trubiano
(ph)
case
involving
the
steals.
of
course
i
am
not
here
to
argue
the
question
of
retroactivity
of
the
chimel
case
decided
some
later
10
months
ago.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
do
so.
i
know
that
mr.
justice
harlan's
statement
and
one
of
the
other
cases
that
it
should
be
applied
the
case
is
still
subject
to
direct
review
by
this
court
but
i
have
not
approached
the
matter
from
that
point
of
view.
i
might
refer
for
a
moment
to
the
case
of
james
versus
louisiana
in
which
a
man
was
arrested
two
blocks
from
his
house,
and
this
court
held
in
a
unanimous
decision
per
curiam
that
his
home
could
not
be
searched
under
those
circumstances
without
a
warrant.
i
might
mention
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
no,
i'd
go
further
shipley
which
is
the
one
you
decided
on
the
same
day
as
the
chimel
case.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
just
can't
see
any
difference
and
the
only
reason
i've
gone
–
i'm
putting
my
case
on
the
basis
on
which
i
have
especially
on
this
oral
argument
is
that
i
can't
understand
why
you
would
ask
for
a
hearing.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
i
go
further
than
that,
exactly
the
same
as
the
chimel
case.
its
open
it
involves
a
similar
situation
except
it
goes
back
one
step
because
he
wasn't
in
the
home
on
arrest.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
shipley
and
van
cleef.
but
shipley
is
very
closely
on
point
because
he
was
arrested
that
he
was
getting
out
of
his
automobile
near
his
home.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
no,
it
was
decided
on
law
prior
to
the
chimel.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
chimel
or
chimel.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
exactly
and
i
just
want
to
mention
if
i
may
as
a
little
interesting
sidelight
that
the
james
case
i
have
talked
about
james
otis
who
was
the
father
of
the
fourth
amendment.
this
man's
name
was
otis,
james.
now,
in
shipley,
very
frankly
when
this
court
said
not
referring
to
the
chimel
case
at
all,
the
constitution
has
never
been
construed
and
that
statement
i
confine
--
i
cannot
find
it
any
exception.
i
can't
find
that
that's
wrong.
by
this
court
to
claim
to
allow
the
police
in
the
absence
of
an
emergency
to
arrest
the
person
outside
his
home
and
then
take
him
inside
for
the
purpose
of
conducting
a
warrantless
search
on
the
contrary
it
has
always
been
assumed
that
once
house
cannot
lawfully
be
search
without
a
search
warrant
except
as
an
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
therein.
now,
that's
a
per
curiam
decision.
the
statement
as
i
said,
the
position
of
the
state
in
this
court
at
any
rate
is
that
this
was
an
effect
a
hot
pursuit,
and
that
this
wasn't
really
a
general
search
that
it
last
to
only
two
or
three
minutes.
now,
i
dispute
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
the
record
and
i'll
take
only
a
moment
to
mention
that.
the
brief
of
the
state
says
that
approximately
a
minute
or
two
no
more
than
three
minutes
--
oh,
i'm
sorry
that's
the
transcript.
within
minutes
says
the
brief
after
entering
the
house,
the
officers
found
the
heroin
and
dilaudid
and
so
on.
now,
what
and
the
reference
there
is
to
page
12
of
the
transcript,
the
appendix
which
says,
“that
approximately
a
minute
or
two
no
more
than
three
minutes
officer
laumann
had
walked
into
the
back
bedroom
and
while
i
was
standing
in
the
front
room,
james
vale
and
his
mother
came
into
the
front
room
of
the
house.
at
this
time,
i
identified
myself
to
them
and
told
them
donald
vale
was
under
arrest
and
we
were
going
to
conduct
a
search
of
the
house.”
that's
where
the
two
or
three
minutes
came
in.
he
told
them
they
were
going
to
search.
we
simply
submit
and
may
it
please
the
court,
that
appellant
was
convicted
on
the
basis
of
evidence
obtained
in
violation
of
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment.
that
conviction
was
affirmed
actually
here
be
reversed.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
certainly.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
yes,
sir.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
that
could
be
the
only
question
actually.
the
state
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
one
of
jurisdiction
and
the
court
postponed
that
to
the
merit.
the
state
has
not
raised
the
question
of
jurisdiction
in
its
brief
to
this
court.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
you
see
the
state
supreme
court
cited
the
statute
permitting
the
search
on
making
arrest
and
then
held
not
very
specifically
or
clearly
that
there
was
nothing
violated
of
the
constitution
in
the
arrest
made
under
that
--
and
the
search
made
under
that
statute
which
i
construe
to
mean
that
they
held
that
the
statute
as
so
applied
does
not
violate
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment.
if
so,
this
is
a
good
appeal
if
not
it
belongs
here
on
cert
in
any
event.
that
would
be
my
construction.
they
held
the
statute
not
to
be
violated.
the
statute
is
so
applied
not
to
be
violated
with
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
mr.
chief
justice
three
or
four
observations
in
connection
perhaps
primarily
with
the
discussion
yesterday.
i
did
make
inquiry
mr.
justice
white
is
to
how
long
it
would
take
to
get
a
search
warrant
because
i
have
no
idea
of
my
own.
i
was
told
that
the
ordinary
practice
of
a
situation
of
that
sort
is
for
one
of
the
officers
to
telephone
that
they're
coming
down,
give
the
appropriate
information,
and
get
the
necessary
papers
ready
while
they
were
on
their
way
back
within
the
day
time
while
courts
are
opened.
they
--
it
does
take
only
about
30
minutes
to
prepare
the
necessary
papers
and
add
to
that
the
time
going
in
and
coming
back
out
should
not
be
more
than
one
hour
for
whatever
that’s
worth.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
in
the
day
time,
yes
sir.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
there's
no
question
about
that
that
is
the
optimum
situation.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i'm
not
at
all
certain
mr.
chief
justice
that
a
search
warrant
would
be
issued
in
such
a
case
on
the
type
of
evidence
they
had.
now,
the
statement
is
made
--
has
been
made
that
there
was
a
narcotics
transaction
which
have
taken
place.
actually
no
one
saw
that,
they
saw
what
they
thought
was
a
narcotics
transaction.
there
was
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i'm
sure
that
on
that
alone,
they
would
never
get
a
conviction
at
least
i
assume
that
from
reading
the
newspapers.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
about
probable
cause
and
i
plead
i
don’t
dispute
that.
i
don’t
dispute
the
probable
cause.
i
made
the
statement
that
he
has
that
i
didn’t
know
never
seen
a
search
warrant
so
i
couldn’t
very
well
speak
about
it.
in
the
course
of
checking
on
that
i
find
that
with
one
exception
in
the
history
of
this
court
at
least
to
modern
history
no
writ
of
certiorari
has
ever
been
issued
out
to
this
court
and
no
one
has
ever
seen
one
where
used
to
using
this
terms
without
really
realizing
what
they
are.
i
assume
the
judge
to
this
court
had.
i
was
asked
yesterday
too
about
the
question
as
to
why
a
hearing
should
be
granted
in
this
case
and
it
should
not
have
been
handled
summarily.
i
assume
that
was
because
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
white
while
concurring
in
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
the
two
prior
case
has
decided
in
june
of
last
year
said
that
they
dissented
from
a
summary
dismissed
--
summary
reversal
of
those
cases
without
a
hearing.
and
that
under
those
circumstances
it
was
thought
best
to
grant
a
hearing
in
one
case
for
the
trial.
now,
we
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
yes
sir,
von
cleef
and
shipley,
that’s
right.
now,
we
rely
of
course
on
agnello,
james
and
shipley
in
which
and
the
statement
finally
made
in
shipley
that
no
warrant
has
ever
been
--
had
no
search
has
ever
been
held
to
be
valid
when
the
arrest
was
made
outside
the
premises
in
which
the
search
took
place.
we
submit
the
case.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i'm
very
grateful
for
the
privilege
mr.
chief
justice.
