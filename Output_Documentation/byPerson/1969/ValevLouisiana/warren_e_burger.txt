mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
i'm
sure
you
could
have
proceeded
in
either
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
begin
the
complain
before
they
began
the
search?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
see
a
difference
in
language
of
that
statute
as
between
saying
about
his
person
and
on
his
person?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
means
the
same
thing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
doesn't
mean
about
in
the
sense
of
lying
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
wondered
if
you
were
emphasizing
that
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
i
ask
you
mr.
mr.
deutsch
that
relates
that
to
the
present
situation.
i
take
it
from
what
you
have
said
that
probably
would
agree
that
the
information
which
the
police
end
up
at
the
time
they
went
in
who
made
the
search
and
have
presented
that
to
the
magistrate
on
oath
they
could've
got
a
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
you
agree
with
those
practicalities
too?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
you'd
agree
with
those
practicalities?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
do
agree
that
they
could
have
got
a
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
if
they
stayed
there,
could
--
they
don't
replace
this
man
under
arrest?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
placed
his
brother
under
arrest
a
few
moments
later?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
they
then
have
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
could
make
them
sit
on
a
chair
under
arrest
and
wait
until
the
warrant
got
back?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
without
invading
their
privacy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
think
they
were
lawfully
in
the
house
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
he
could
not
on
my
--
the
hypothesis
i
gave
you,
you
would
not
agree
with,
he
could've
made
the
two
brothers
sit
down
in
chairs
and
wait
the
return
of
the
warrant,
they'd
have
to
take
him
out
on
the
porch
or
outside?
chief
justice
warren
e.

what
--
i
thought
you
conceded
they
could
get
a
warrant,
what
could
they
get
a
warrant
for?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
part
of
your
case
is
that
they
had
an
alternative
namely
to
get
a
warrant
and
i'm
exploring
your
alternative
to
which
(voice

mrs.

you
may

chief

warren
e.

well,
do
you

they
were
entitled
of
that
point
to
search
for
firearms
to
see
whether
they
were
exposed
to
any
danger
from

chief

mr.

let
me
go
back
to
the
hypothetical
that
mr.

put
to

that
is
if
he
encountered

six
blocks

in
that
circumstance,
would
he
have
any
basis
for
thinking
the
house
was
the
source
of
supply
having
been
seen
him
come
from
the
house
to
make
the
sale?
chief

warren
e.

is
this
the
case
in
which
the

shows
that
they
have
habitually
used
three
or
four
connecting

the

favorable

probable
