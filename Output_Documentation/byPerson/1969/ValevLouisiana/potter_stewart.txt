justice
potter
stewart
i
think
there
were
some
indications
the
door
was
opened.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
he
was
--
had
come
close
enough
so
that
he
had
opened
the
door,
if
that
was
right?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
that's
a
misunderstanding.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
the
record
show
how
many
rooms
this
house
had?
justice
potter
stewart
three
downstairs
room?
justice
potter
stewart
three
downstairs
room?
justice
potter
stewart
all
one
floor.
and
since
i've
already
interrupted
you,
they
of
course
did
not
have
a
search
warrant?
justice
potter
stewart
they
had
an
arrest
warrant,
did
they
or
capias?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
were
--
we
have
consumed
i
guess
in
this
case
that
this
was
a
lawful
arrest,
can
we?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
there
is
someone
else
in
the
house
then
the
police
--
assume
the
police
might
have
gotten
the
warrant.
assume
they
had
probable
cause
to
get
a
warrant
you
could
leave
the
police
in
the
house
and
do
what?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
if
there's
another
person
in
the
house
and
the
other
person
is
wandering,
can
you
follow
that
person
around
all
over
the
house
to
make
sure
he
doesn't
destroy
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
would
suppose
that
would
be
the
most
normal
thing
in
the
world
if
a
confederate
or
member
of
the
family
or
something
was
in
the
house
and
the
police
is
waiting
there
to
keep
evidence
from
being
destroyed.
i
suppose
if
they
are
going
to
achieve
that,
they
would
have
to
follow
the
person
around
all
over
the
house.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
where
is
your
privacy
going
then
if
you
leave
the
policeman
there
and
he
follows
you
around
all
over?(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
five
or
six
hours
or
two
hours
or
two
days
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
mean
if
you
get
it
typed
--
the

typed

and
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
time
of

justice
potter
stewart
how
long
that
they
have
been
stick
out
there?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
which
--
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
record
show
that
they
have
information
that
come
to
him
indicated
that
he
was
selling
on
that
address
on
that
day?
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
arrest
legal
because
of
the
capias
that
the
officers
had
or
was
it
legal
because
of
what
they
have
seen
that
apparently
donald
vale?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
confederates
generally
don’t
hide
in
somebody’s
coat
pocket?
justice
potter
stewart
as
--

when

was
nobody
in
the

justice
potter
stewart
and
the
fact
is
there

justice
potter
stewart
how
do
you
--

you
say
that
if
after
they
had
seen
this
transaction
they
just
simply
going
down
and
get
a
search
warrant,
they
hadn't
been
seen
by
vale
or
anybody
else

neighborhood
was
this
in
the
new
orleans?
residential
or
business
or
commercial,
what
