not
necessarily
because
if
you
took
the
reasoning
of
judge
fuld
in
new
york
in
his
dissent
in
this
case,
you
would
say
that
the
--
or
could
argue
at
least
that
the
requirement
of
a
finding
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
was
necessary
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
fifth
amendment
unless
a
juvenile
is
not
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment.
that
was
his
argument,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
he
ties
it
to
the
fifth
amendment
and
i
don't
know
if
that's
the
argument,
but
this
amendment
uses
the
word
in
any
criminal
case,
shall
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
and
the
sixth
amendment
uses
a
phrase,
“and
all
criminal
prosecutions.”
so
the
question
really
is
whether
assuming
that
reasonable
doubt
standard
is
applicable
as
well
as
this
is
a
criminal
case
or
what
is
a
criminal
prosecution?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'm
not
saying
that
that
he
was.
i'm
just
saying
that
in
terms
of
the
--
of
what
you
call
the
proceeding,
a
criminal
proceeding,
constitution
has
called
criminal
case
or
criminal
prosecution,
whether
or
not
those
standards
would
come
in
to
this
kind
of
a
proceeding.
that's
