chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
you
see
someone
that
you
have
known
before,
isn't
one
second
sometimes
enough?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
difference
does
it
make
which
time
she
drew
those
conclusions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
did
she
say
about
having
known
him
previously?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
that
the
only
reason
for
it,
merely
because
of
his
age
or
is
it
because
whether
misguided
or
well-advised,
a
system
of
juvenile
courts
was
set
up
to
take
people
under
a
given
age
out
of
the
criminal
process
and
away
from
the
stream
of
criminal
proceedings
and
to
protect
them,
isn't
that
the
background?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
new
york,
is
there
a
judgment
of
guilt
in
a
criminal
act
in
this
kind
of
a
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
really
a
demand
for
the
best
of
both
worlds,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
want
--
do
you
want
all
these
children
put
right
into
the
criminal
court
system
tried
under
criminal,
full-scale
criminal
standards?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
aren't
you
moving
--
aren't
you
moving
every
point
in
your
case
toward
a
criminal
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
the
predicate
of
the
whole
system?
didn't
these
reformers
who
set
up
the
system
which
the
courts
are
now
dismantling
piece
by
piece
originally
say
that
no
lawyers
could
be
there,
the
judge
wouldn't
have
a
robe,
there
wouldn't
be
a
bench,
it
couldn't
be
any
newspaper
reporters
there
and
no
one
could
mention
his
name,
weren't
all
these
steps
done
to
protect
the
child
from
the
traumatic
experience
of
the
criminal
court
setting?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
court
has
started
to
do
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
speaking
of
this
court.
this
court
started
to
make
that
evaluation
of
the
“unwisdom”
of
the
system.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
a
very
sound
legislative
evaluation
probably?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
the
system
isn't
working
very
well,
but
is
it
--
is
it
--
is
it
up
to
us
to
be
amending
and
is
up
to
the
people
who
made
it
to
be
amending?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
aren't
these
--
aren't
these
propositions
that
should
be
addressed
to
the
legislature
and
not
to
this
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
know
of
any
constitutional
prohibition
against
this
court
deciding
that
the
preponderance
of
evidence
should
be
rule
in
all
full
scale
criminal
cases
in
all
the
states
and
in
the
federal
courts?
what
in
the
constitution
would
prohibit
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
in
favor
of
it,
if
you
understand
it,
i'm
just
asking
whether
we
have
the
power
to
do
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
buchsbaum.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
in
the
sense
of
getting
a
search
warrant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
suppose
it
would
follow
a
fortiori
that
if
new
york
had
a
rule
that
when
some
juvenile
was
charged
without
more
of
the
court
would
incarcerate
him,
so
that
what
you're
saying
is
that
this
is
a
spectrum
and
under
the
due
process
clause
it's
question
of
degree
if
it's
a
due
process
question
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
child
required
to
respond
to
questions
in
the
new
york
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
the
corollary
to
that
statement,
if
done
by
an
adult
would
be
crime,
but
if
not
done
by
an
adult,
it
is
not
a
crime.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
should
think
it
would
be
the
only
logical
corollary
available.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
new
york's
standard
for
civil
commitment
proceedings
because
of
mental
disorder?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you're
suggesting
there
is
no
difference
in
these
two.
it's
just
the
situations,
but
if
you
can
put
a
man
in
a
mental
institution
for
perhaps
five
or
ten
years
by
a
preponderance
you
can
put
juvenile
in
a
non-criminal
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
exhausted,
mrs.
uviller,
but
if
there
are
perhaps
any
questions
from
the
court,
you
may
respond
to
them
in
three
minutes?
no
there's
no
time
left.
chief
justice

e.

the
