justice
thurgood
marshall
but
is
it
your
position
that
the
only
thing
you're
complaining
about
is
the
standard
of
proof?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
complain
about
the
judge,
how
he
acts,
where
the
trial
is,
what
the
proceeding
is,
what
the
rules,
all
you
want
is
that
--
is
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
want
to
give
up
any
of
the
other
benefits?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
your
rule
were
the
rule
when
this
case
with
tried
this
fellow
would
have
been
turned
loose?
justice
thurgood
marshall
under
the
judge's
own
statement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
call
a
charge
if
a
12-year-old
broke
into
a
house
and
stole
a
television
set,
is
that
anything
other
than
a
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
was
he
charged
with
in
the
juvenile
court,
what
act?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
problem
with
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
see
any
difference
in
what
you
label
it.
he
is
charged
with
break-in
and
entry
and
taking
something
that
belongs
to
somebody
else
for
the
purpose
of
depriving
that
person
of
the
use
thereof
and
to
me
that
sound
very
much
a
crime.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
just
want
to
say
that
one
point
is
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
only
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
don't
need
reasonable
doubt
to
find
out
that
he
in
fact
was
the
one
who
did
it.
you
don't
need
reasonable
doubt
for
that,
the
reason
about
standard,
solely
because
he
was
12
years
old.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
can
be
put
in
a
prison
for
six
years?
justice
thurgood
marshall
aren't
you
really
arguing
that
because
of
the
protection
putting
around
the
juvenile
in
these
special
court
proceedings
in
the
all
that
is
balanced
off
as
in
the
excuse
for
not
using
reasonable
doubt
as
the
standard,
is
that
what
you
are
arguing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
just
asking
about
your
position.
i'm
not
interested
in
being
pound
or
any
other
people.
i'm
asking
is
that
what
you're
arguing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
only
--
as
i
understand
the
petitioner's
only
point
is
the
denial
of
the
standard
of
reasonable
doubt,
that's
the
only
point.
they
want
to
keep
all
of
the
other
parts,
all
the
good
parts.
justice

is
that
a
violation
of
