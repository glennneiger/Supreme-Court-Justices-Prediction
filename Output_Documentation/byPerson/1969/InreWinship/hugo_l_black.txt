justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
that
the
only
question
you
brought
up,
the
only
question
you
raised,
the
only
question
the
court
decided
was
whether
or
not
an
infant
could
be
found
guilty
of
an
offense
on
proof
of
a
mere
preponderance
of
evidence
or
whether
he
has
a
proof
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
say
though,
isn't
that
the
only
question
before
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
whether
the
constitution
requires
to
be
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
are
saying
as
i
understand
it
is
that
new
york
has
a
right
if
it
wants
to
pass
a
law
that
says
that
a
person
of
12
years
of
age
shall
not
be
charged
with
or
tried,
or
convicted
for
any
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
say
that
new
york
has
passed
such
a
law
as
i've
mentioned
that
no
child
of
12,
shall
be
charged
with
or
convicted
of
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
that
law
has
been
construed
as
meaning
a
child
of
12
shall
not
be
convicted
or
charged
for
the
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
or
two
questions
to
clarify
my
mind
which
you
argue.
suppose
this
child
have
not
been
a
child
but
he's
been
25
years
old
and
charged
with
a
crime,
do
you
think
the
constitution
requires
the
proof
to
convict
--
the
constitution,
i'm
not
talking
about
anything
but
the
constitution,
requires
the
proof
to
be
shown
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
his
guilt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
charged
with
the
crime,
the
measure
of
proof,
do
you
think
that
the
constitution
requires
that
his
proof
of
guilt
be
shown
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
or
that
it
could
be
satisfied
by
showing
his
guilty
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they'd
have
to
do
that
on
the
basis
of
a
criterion
that
i
don't
agree
to
of
course
which
is
question
of
fairness
that
we
have
a
right
to
decide
what's
fair
and
if
we
decide
it's
not
fair
say
it's
unconstitutional.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
definitely
that
this
person
has
been
discharged
on
this
particular
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
was
he
discharged?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
is
not
under
confinement
now
under
this
charge?
