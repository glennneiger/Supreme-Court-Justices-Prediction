justice
potter
stewart
certainly,
in
other
words,
you
suggest
it's
not
up
to
us
here
to
say,
well,
we
reviewed
the
evidence
and
we
think
he
could
have
found
the
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
this
young
fellow
stole
the
purse.
you
say
it's
none
of
our
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
standard
in
each
of
the
50
states
here?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
assume
you
may
be
right
with
respect
to
commitment
of
the
incompetence
or
narcotics
addicts
or
alcoholics
and
so
on,
but
coming
closer
to
home
right
here
in
new
york,
as
i
understand
the
city's
argument
that
children
maybe
confined
and
maybe
confined
in
substantially
or
exactly
the
same
place
that
this
young
man
was
confined
after
finding
that
there
are
persons
in
need
of
supervision
and
i
would
gather
that
doesn't
need
all
sorts
of
expert
testimony.
that's
not
a
--
and
would
you
concede
that
in
order
to
support
a
finding
that
a
young
person
is
in
need
of
supervision
that
preponderance
of
the
evidence
is
all
that's
required?
justice
potter
stewart
but
doesn't
the
young
person
--
isn't
that
--
if
possible
he's
going
to
end
up
in
the
same
institution?
justice
potter
stewart
but
none
--
and
none
of
these
things
so
far
that
you've
mentioned
and
i
suppose
truancy
would
be
another
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
would
be
a
criminal
offense
if
committed
by
an
adult.
justice
potter
stewart
of
a
person
in
need
of
supervision.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
so
--
at
least
arguendo
you
concede
the
city
is
right
to
that
extent
in
its
--
in
its
what
are
we
coming
to
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
but
just
as
so
i
understand
it
you
--
i
understood
that
you
would
say
that
logic
which
compelled
the
result
that
if
a
standard
of
proof
of
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
required
here
in
constitution
and
the
same
standard
would
be
required
in
the
new
york
system
to
prove
that
a
young
person
was
a
person
in
need
of
supervision.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
however
a
finding
of
guilt
as
such,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
if
in
new
york
--
to
explain
in
the
new
york
system,
what
does
new
york
call
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
isn't
–-
am
i
not
correct
that
pins
people
end
up
there
too?
justice
potter
stewart
persons
in
need
of
supervision?
justice
potter
stewart
and
they're
in
need
of
supervisions
and
as
to
whom
has
been
no
finding
probably
at
least
certainly
hasn't
necessarily
been
any
finding
that
they
have
performed
any
act
that
if
committed
by
an
adult
would
be
a
criminal
offense.
justice
potter
stewart
but
just
that
they
are
persons
in
need
of
supervision?
justice
potter
stewart
what
happens
to
neglected
children
or
defective
children
or
dependent
children
in
new
york?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
i
think
your
argument
necessarily
depends,
does
it
not,
on
persuading
the
court
that
this
is
punishment?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
necessary
in
the
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
punishment.
justice
potter
stewart
and
precisely
the
same
thing
can
happen
to
a
child
found
to
be
in
need
of
supervision?
justice
potter
stewart
as
suggested
by
the
chief
justice
and
mrs.
uviller
directed
herself
to
this,
this
really
doesn't
have
much
to
do
with
the
issue
before
us.
now,
except
insofar
as
it
that
may
go
to
whether
or
not
what
happened
here
was
the
equivalent
of
a
finding
of
guilt
and
the
imposition
of
punishment.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
--
and
if
it
is
--
if
it
is
tantamount
to
that,
and
if
the
constitution
requires
that
in
a
criminal
case
where
the
issue
is
the
determination
or
guilt
and
the
imposition
of
punishment,
the
due
process
or
some
other
provision
of
the
constitution
requires
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
mrs.
uviller
is
correct
and
if
--
but
whether
or
not
these
are
well
or
badly
run
institutions
or
how
many
house
mothers
they
have
and
how
big
the
cottages
are
and
so
on.
except
insofar
as
it
goes,
maybe
its
your
submission
that
this
is
not
the
equivalent
of
guilt
and
punishment,
those
issues
are
really
for
the
new
york
state
legislature,
not
for
the
courts.
justice
potter
stewart
this
--
while
your
on
that
subject
i
think
i
saw
in
the
brief
that
this
person
has
now
been
released,
is
that
correct
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
question
of
mootness
here?
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
same
risk
of
publicity
and
of
a
record
and
so
on
being
made
available
to
employers
in
the
military
and
to
sentencing
judges
in
criminal
cases
when
the
person
becomes
an
adult
and
so
on.
is
that
same
risk
present
with
respect
to
a
child
has
been
found
to
be
a
person
in
need
of
supervision
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
represented
that
there
is
some
risk?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
i
--
as
i
remember
the
briefs,
it
was
represented
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
perhaps
of
law
if
this
person
later
as
an
adult
commits
a
criminal
offense
is
found
guilty
of
the
criminal
offense
then
his
juvenile
record
is
made
available
to
the
sentencing
judge,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
that
true
also
with
respect
to
a
person
who
as
a
juvenile
has
been
found
to
be
a
person
in
need
of
supervision,
that's
my
question?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
understand
your
argument
in
