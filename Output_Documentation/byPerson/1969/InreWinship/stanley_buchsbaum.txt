mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
want
to
take
a
moment
on
the
finding
by
the
court
below.
i
think
that
it
may
be
a
little
misleading
to
suggest
that
the
judge
in
the
family
court
said
that
if
the
standard
of
proof
was
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
he
would
have
reached
a
different
result.
and
early
in
my
brief,
i
discussed
this
in
quote
from
the
appendix
as
to
what
happened
at
that
point
and
if
this
becomes
an
element
in
the
case
which
i
rather
doubt,
i
think
the
court
should
look
at
what
happened.
because
the
judge
made
his
finding
in
accordance
with
the
law
and
then
counsel
for
the
trial
started
what
ended
up
as
philosophic
discussion
about
the
various
standards
of
proof
and
the
judge
then
made
some
remarks
which
in
the
appellant's
brief
have
all
been
telescoped
even
though
they're
page
apart
and
gives
the
feeling
that
he
is
talking
about
this
specific
case,
when
apparently
he
is
talking
about
determinations
in
general.
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
central
issue.
the
question
is
whether
the
constitution
requires
that
in
the
proceeding
of
this
kind,
there
must
be
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
that
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard
is
inadequate.
now,
there
is
no
specific
constitutional
provision.
so
the
question
comes
down
to
whether
due
process
requires
it.
and
as
i
see
it
that
either
must
go
along
one
of
two
paths;
either
that
in
a
criminal
case,
you
must
have
such
proof
and
this
is
a
criminal
case
or
two
the
nature
of
what
happens
after
this
proceeding,
the
loss
of
liberty,
the
incarceration,
the
possibility
of
that
is
of
such
a
nature
that
due
process
requires
that
standard
of
proof.
aside
from
those
two
paths,
i
cannot
see
how
this
can
be
decided
as
a
constitutional
question.
now,
much
of
the
discussion
we've
had
in
this
field
and
i've
seen
it
in
some
opinions
in
the
law
review
articles
discuss
this
without
referring
to
the
constitution
on
the
assumption
that
due
process
is
what
i
think
is
wise
and
if
i
think
this
is
wise,
the
constitution
requires
it
and
obviously,
this
court
does
not
approach
the
problem
that
way.
now,
let's
see
whether
this
is
a
criminal
proceeding
and
here
i
suggest
that
mr.
justice
fortas
in
the
gault
opinion
was
writing
far
ranging.
he
was
writing
about
the
entire
juvenile
system
and
he
was
dealing
with
a
case
which
at
least
to
me
seemed
quite
horrendous.
and
what
he
did
was
from
all
the
writings,
studies,
very
often
students
at
the
law
school
probably
had
never
seen
a
juvenile
court,
what
they
wrote,
he
was
picking
out
all
the
things
that
went
wrong.
if
something
went
wrong
in
oregon
which
didn't
go
wrong
in
any
other
state
that
was
listed.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
we're
dealing
with
the
question
of
whether
the
court
is
the
equivalent
of
a
criminal
court,
we
must
deal
in
this
case
with
the
new
york
court.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
i
would
want
to
think
it
would.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
if
it's
just
--
what
i
understand
probable
cause
is
a
probability
not
a
finding
of
decision
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
i
would
think
that
almost
anything
which
depends
upon
someone
saying,
i
think,
this
maybe
so
when
therefore
finality
results
from
it.
what
we're
dealing
with
a
subject
altogether
different
from
a
juvenile
delinquency
would
raise
a
due
process
question.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
i
think
in
a
purely
civil
case.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
no
but
i
think
due
process
does
require
that
there
must
be
some
element
of
logic
in
reaching
a
conclusion
and
that
there's
something
lacking
in
logic
if
you
say
something
must
happen
as
a
finality
in
a
case
in
any
type
of
case
simply
because
someone
thinks
it
might
have
happened.
no
conclusion
as
to
this
happened
or
this
didn't
happen,
i
think
that
would
raise
a
due
process
question.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
yes.
i
think
that's
true,
but
i
think
if
you're
going
to
hold
out
from
all
your
cases
those
which
to
which
you
must
apply
the
standard
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
i
only
see
two
basis
for
selecting
the
juvenile
delinquency
proceeding.
it's
falling
into
that
category.
one,
either
that
it's
so
akin
to
the
criminal
case
that
requires
it
or
two,
that's
a
proceeding
which
may
lead
to
loss
of
liberty
and
therefore
requires
it.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
that
depends
upon
whether
you're
going
to
say
that
any
attempt
to
make
reform,
you
just
look
through
it
and
we
had
at
rhode
island
a
judge
who
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
appellant
seeks
and
in
his
opinion,
he
said
the
murder
is
murder,
burglary
is
burglary
and
we
must
recognize
it,
but
that's
exactly
what
the
juvenile
court
system
was
aimed
to
prevent.
it
was
a
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
there
is
no
question
that
under
the
new
york
law,
to
start
a
juvenile
delinquency
proceeding,
you
must
charge
someone
with
an
act
which
have
committed
by
an
adult
would
constitute
a
crime.
now,
i'm
going
to
suggest
that
this
constitutional
question
cannot
depend
upon
that
because
suppose
new
york
passes
a
law
next
year,
lumps
persons
in
need
of
supervision
and
the
present
juvenile
proceeding
on
under
a
title
deviant
conduct,
deviant
conduct
and
says
that
you
can
bring
this
proceeding
and
show
that
the
child's
conduct
deviates
from
what
is
regarded
as
a
desirable
norm
and
then
proceed.
i
don't
think
that
change
would
make
something
constitutional
which
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
either
even
though
the
deviating
conduct
would
be
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
well,
but
the
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
i
concede
that,
that
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
i
don't
think
there
was
an
issue
about
it.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
not
solely
because
he
is
12
years
old,
but
because
being
12
years
old,
this
is
not
regarded
as
a
crime
and
he
is
not
being
treated
as
a
criminal.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
that's
right
and
in
this
proceeding,
the
things
that
occur
in
this
proceeding
are
not
to
be
distorted
as
the
equivalent
of
his
having
been
charged
with
a
crime
or
having
been
found
guilty
of
a
crime
and
that's
why
it's
labeled
a
fact
finding
determination
and
then
you
have
a
dispositional
hearing
which
is
not
a
suspended
sentence.
no
matter
what
the
child
did,
no
matter
how
if
it
serious
a
crime
that
would
have
been
done,
considered
if
committed
by
an
adult,
a
clear
cut
evidence
the
child
did
it,
if
they
find
that
this
child
does
not
need
confinement
or
supervision
to
avoid
this
happening
again
or
avoid
similar
conduct
happening
again,
he
is
not
found
to
be
a
juvenile
delinquent
and
the
case
would
have
been
dismissed.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
that's
right,
your
honor
and
there's
no
such
thing
as
waiving
to
the
criminal
court
in
new
york.
no
such
thing
at
all
as
long
as
the
charge
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
he
can
be
confined
in
appropriate
institution
for
a
limited
period
which
after
being
reviewed
maybe
extended
to
a
longer
period
where
if
the
child
is
12
could
possibly
be
extended.
there
is
time
to
succeed
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
exactly.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
or
insane,
you
also
can
be
confined
in
the
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
but
also
just
to
point
out
the
types
of
distinctions,
the
civil
commitment
at
least
in
new
york
and
i
think
in
many
other
states
does
not
require
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
new
york
limits
civil
commitments
generally,
but
other
the
states
do
not
limit
the
period
of
times
as
much
in
new
york.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
the
answer
is
no.
everything
that
was
found
to
be
wrong
in
the
gault
case,
new
york
by
statute
had
cured
long
before
the
gault
case.
i
will
not
attempt
to
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
it
said
that
the
child
need
not
to
--
could
remain
silent.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
it
said
that
the
child
may
remain
silent.
that
was
the
one
aspect
in
which
the
gault
case
did
touch
upon
this
as
though
it
was
an
issue
of
due
process
which
would
--
as
to
all
other
aspects
as
spoken
by
due
process
and
civil
or
criminal
cases
required
certain
things.
in
this
respect,
it
said
that
this
was
analogous
to
a
criminal
case.
although
it
went
on
immediately
after
it
showed
that
that
remark
was
unnecessary
because
in
arizona
the
child
still
could
have
been
waived
to
a
criminal
court
and
tried
on
a
criminal
basis.
well,
what
i
suggest
and
i'm
not
going
to
attempt
to
cover
all
of
the
various
aspects
in
which
this
juvenile
court
in
new
york
differs
from
a
criminal
court,
but
there
are
these
differences.
there
is
not
this
finding
of
guilt
as
we're
told
and
while
the
places
of
confinement
may
be
not
be
ideal
and
much
can
be
done
to
prove
it.
we
do
find
in
new
york,
there
is
a
constant
restudy
on
this
field,
there
is
a
constant
attempt
to
improve
far
too
slow,
far
too
slow
and
often
inadequate,
but
there
are
constant
changes
and
while
i
hesitate
to
speak
of
the
manner
of
confinement
without
knowing
precisely
and
it
wasn't
evident
from
the
record,
the
brief
of
the
attorney
general,
submitted,
does
point
out
and
i'm
not
saying
that
anyone
is
willing
to
go
to
these
places,
that
the
training
schools
operate
under
a
college
unit
system
which
generally
is
made
up
of
semi-independent
groups,
many
of
which
a
limited
to
20
young
people
that
there
are
in
an
open
setting
without
the
restraint
of
locks
or
bars,
that
house
parents
live
on
the
premises
and
act
as
guides
and
mentors
as
well
as
supervisors,
that
home
visits
are
made
by
the
boys
and
girls
on
a
regular
basis
and
vocational
academic
features
are
provided.
now,
perhaps
this
is
the
idea
that
they
aim
at
and
perhaps
they
don't
always
comply
but
this
is
what
they're
trying
to
do.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
yes
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
exactly.
now,
mr.
justice
marshall
has
suggested
that
the
mere
fact
that
this
starts
off
because
of
an
act
which
would
constitute
a
crime,
everything
flows
to
it.
i
think
that's
a
suggestion
and
it
must
be
treated
as
a
crime
and
all
these
trimmings
that
you're
putting
on
and
all
you've
got
is
a
criminal
court
trying
a
criminal
case
to
put
somebody
of
way
as
you
do
in
the
criminal
court
and
therefore
at
least
in
approach,
in
answer
to
that
approach,
i
think
it's
important
to
consider
every
element
from
the
intake
procedure
where
even
though
a
petition
is
drawn
up
which
says
that
the
child
committed
an
act
which
would
be
a
crime
by
an
adult
and
a
substantial
portion
of
the
case
is
they
review
this
and
never
even
reaches
a
fact
finding
stage
and
they
decide
even
though
the
evidence
is
there,
this
doesn't
call
for
juvenile
delinquency
proceeding
in
this
child.
through
the
dispositional
hearing,
where
after
the
evidence
may
be
proved
on
a
basis
which
go
far
beyond
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
an
absolute
certainty,
nevertheless,
there
is
no
finding
of
juvenile
delinquency
because
the
child
doesn't
need
confinement
or
supervision.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
yes
but
i'm
suggesting
that
all
these
elements
should
be
considered
in
deciding
whether
this
is
really
a
criminal
proceeding.
now,
if
the
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
i
can
only
respond
this
way.
that
when
this
started
off,
judge
julian
mack,
rascoe
pound
and
others,
who
are
the
strong
proponents
of
the
children's
court,
certainly
did
not
think
that
they
had
found
a
way
of
evading
constitutional
requirements
with
respect
to
criminal
law
and
i
respectfully
submit
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
well,
i
hardly
thought
so
until
your
honor
suggested
me.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
and
what
i
--
what
i
thought
i
was
trying
to
do
was
to
try
to
analyze
whether
there
is
a
constitutional
requirement
that
in
this
type
of
proceeding,
there
must
be
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
didn't
think
i
was
trying
to
distort
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
and
i
thought
i
was
trying
to
analyze
as
to
whether
a
juvenile
delinquency
court,
the
juvenile
proceeding
as
designed
by
its
original
proponents
as
revised
over
the
years
with
attempts
to
have
due
process
requirements
is
subject
to
a
further
constitutional
requirement
that
you
must
prove
the
wrong
doing
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
or
the
improper
conduct
beyond
a
reasonable
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
put
this,
your
honor.
put
it
–
he
is
charged
with
a
crime
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
i
have
found
no
case
that
decides
that
issue.
i
would
be
inclined
to
think
that
this
court
probably
if
faced
with
that
issue
would
reach
the
conclusion
that
must
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
think,
it
would
say
that
since
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
perhaps
i
misread
it.
i
didn't
quite
read
it
that
way.
i
thought
he
was
saying
that
this
is
a
requirement
of
the,
that
it
become
so
habitual
in
this
country,
that
it
was
necessary
but
perhaps
i
misread
it.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
i'm
afraid
i'm
a
little
dull
on
that
because
there's
no
claim
here
that
the
child
is
required
to
give
any
evidence
against
himself.
now
what
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
that
is
the
essence
of
the
question
there
and
that's
why
i
keep
speaking
about
whether
this
is
truly
a
criminal
proceeding
and
why
i
suggest
that
you
can't
decide
that
it's
a
criminal
proceeding
just
because
the
trigger
that's
starts
it
off
is
an
act
which
if
done
by
an
adult
would
be
a
crime.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
but
certainly
that's
the
intent
of
the
new
york
law.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
well,
i
think
in
justice
to
the
other
side,
if
that
were
a
deliberate
intent
to
mislead
or
even
if
would
not
deliberate,
if
in
fact
what
you
really
had
was
a
criminal
case
than
just
labeling
it
is
not
being
criminal
case
would
not
get
by,
but
it's
not
merely
the
label,
it's
not
merely
calling
in
a
civil
proceeding
that
makes
it
any
less
a
criminal
case.
the
question
is,
looking
at
the
thing
as
a
whole
from
beginning
to
end
in
every
feature
of
it,
is
this
a
criminal
proceeding
and
i
submit
that
while
you
may
find
a
juvenile
court
set
up
in
some
states,
where
you'd
reach
the
conclusion,
this
is
nothing
but
a
criminal
proceeding
that
you
cannot
so
find
in
new
york.
now,
it's
also
been
suggested,
certainly
in
my
arguments
that
if
you
reach
this
conclusion
you
must
end
up
with
the
jury
trial
in
the
juvenile
courts
and
if
you
reach
it
on
the
basis
of
this
being
a
criminal
proceeding.
and
my
suggestion
that
if
you
base
it
on
loss
of
the
liberty
that
this
may
have
an
impact
on
the
insanity
proceedings
and
the
narcotic
addicts
proceedings
and
the
civil
contempt
proceeding
and
not
the
issues
before
this
court
but
i
submit
that
in
this
case,
the
court
will
decide
which
path
will
be
taken
down
the
certain
hill
and
it's
hard
for
me
to
conceive
ever
going
back
up
that
hill.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
as
i
understand
it's
preponderance
of
evidence
as
in
the
other
proceeding,
any
other
civil
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
now
--
well,
also
i
might
mention
at
this
point
that
there's
been
a
good
deal
of
emphasis
on
well,
this
child
might
have
been
confined
for
six
years
and
if
he
were
an
adult
it
would
only
be
five
years.
this
may
happenstance
because
the
adult
who
might
have
been
confined
for
life,
the
child
does
the
same
act
and
he's
14
years
old
can
at
most
be
confined
for
four
years.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
that's
as
far
as
we
can
determine
from
the
court
records.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
i
would
hesitate
to
suggest
that
there
is
mootness.
this
is
at
least
i
think
even
if
it
were
moot
it
would
come
under
the
rule
that
a
recurring
problem
should
be
disposed
of,
recurring
problem
of
public
importance.
secondly,
the
suggestion
is
made
by
the
appellants
that
even
though
there
is
all
this
confidentialities,
somehow,
someway,
it
may
leak
out
and
this
casts
a
reflection
on
the
child
which
argument
if
accepted
might
pull
it
out
of
the
mootness
area.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
i
can't
even
speak
about
the
first
risk.
see,
that's
one
of
the
difficulties
in
this
case
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
yes
but
i
don't
know
how
they
know.
somebody
found
out
in
the
district
of
columbia
that
there
is
such
a
risk
and
there
seems
to
be
an
assumption
that
there
is
such
a
risk
in
new
york.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
to
the
sentencing
judge,
yes.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
that
is
correct.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
i'm
afraid
that
i
don't
know
the
answer.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
from
all
i
can
hear
he
is
not
given
any
such
information.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
even
on
request.
i
just
don't
know
about
the
military
and
i
hesitate
to
ask
because
there
was
no
one
i
could
ask
who
would
give
me
an
answer
that
i
would
feel
assured
of
is
certainty.
so,
if
i
got
the
answer
that
would
be
favorable
to
my
position,
i
might
be
misleading
the
court
if
i
gave
my
answer.
i
do
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
yes.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
well,
here's
what
happened,
he
went
away
and
after
he
was
away
for
10
months,
he
was
allowed
to
live
with
his
parents.
then
apparently
as
they
put
it
in
the
docket,
he
absconded
from
his
parents'
home
and
was
picked
up
on
a
direction
that
he
sent
away
for
a
year.
that
year
period
has
passed
and
there
is
nothing
on
the
record
to
indicate
that
anything
further
has
been
done,
any
other
attempt
to
confine
him.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
as
far
as
under
this
charge
or
apparently
under
any
other
charges
as
far
as
we
can
find
from
the
records.
i
gather
my
time
is
up.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
want
to
take
a
moment
on
the
finding
by
the
court
below.
i
think
that
it
may
be
a
little
misleading
to
suggest
that
the
judge
in
the
family
court
said
that
if
the
standard
of
proof
was
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
he
would
have
reached
a
different
result.
and
early
in
my
brief,
i
discussed
this
in
quote
from
the
appendix
as
to
what
happened
at
that
point
and
if
this
becomes
an
element
in
the
case
which
i
rather
doubt,
i
think
the
court
should
look
at
what
happened.
because
the
judge
made
his
finding
in
accordance
with
the
law
and
then
counsel
for
the
trial
started
what
ended
up
as
philosophic
discussion
about
the
various
standards
of
proof
and
the
judge
then
made
some
remarks
which
in
the
appellant's
brief
have
all
been
telescoped
even
though
they're
page
apart
and
gives
the
feeling
that
he
is
talking
about
this
specific
case,
when
apparently
he
is
talking
about
determinations
in
general.
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
central
issue.
the
question
is
whether
the
constitution
requires
that
in
the
proceeding
of
this
kind,
there
must
be
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
that
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard
is
inadequate.
now,
there
is
no
specific
constitutional
provision.
so
the
question
comes
down
to
whether
due
process
requires
it.
and
as
i
see
it
that
either
must
go
along
one
of
two
paths;
either
that
in
a
criminal
case,
you
must
have
such
proof
and
this
is
a
criminal
case
or
two
the
nature
of
what
happens
after
this
proceeding,
the
loss
of
liberty,
the
incarceration,
the
possibility
of
that
is
of
such
a
nature
that
due
process
requires
that
standard
of
proof.
aside
from
those
two
paths,
i
cannot
see
how
this
can
be
decided
as
a
constitutional
question.
now,
much
of
the
discussion
we've
had
in
this
field
and
i've
seen
it
in
some
opinions
in
the
law
review
articles
discuss
this
without
referring
to
the
constitution
on
the
assumption
that
due
process
is
what
i
think
is
wise
and
if
i
think
this
is
wise,
the
constitution
requires
it
and
obviously,
this
court
does
not
approach
the
problem
that
way.
now,
let's
see
whether
this
is
a
criminal
proceeding
and
here
i
suggest
that
mr.
justice
fortas
in
the
gault
opinion
was
writing
far
ranging.
he
was
writing
about
the
entire
juvenile
system
and
he
was
dealing
with
a
case
which
at
least
to
me
seemed
quite
horrendous.
and
what
he
did
was
from
all
the
writings,
studies,
very
often
students
at
the
law
school
probably
had
never
seen
a
juvenile
court,
what
they
wrote,
he
was
picking
out
all
the
things
that
went
wrong.
if
something
went
wrong
in
oregon
which
didn't
go
wrong
in
any
other
state
that
was
listed.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
we're
dealing
with
the
question
of
whether
the
court
is
the
equivalent
of
a
criminal
court,
we
must
deal
in
this
case
with
the
new
york
court.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
i
would
want
to
think
it
would.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
if
it's
just
--
what
i
understand
probable
cause
is
a
probability
not
a
finding
of
decision
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
i
would
think
that
almost
anything
which
depends
upon
someone
saying,
i
think,
this
maybe
so
when
therefore
finality
results
from
it.
what
we're
dealing
with
a
subject
altogether
different
from
a
juvenile
delinquency
would
raise
a
due
process
question.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
i
think
in
a
purely
civil
case.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
no
but
i
think
due
process
does
require
that
there
must
be
some
element
of
logic
in
reaching
a
conclusion
and
that
there's
something
lacking
in
logic
if
you
say
something
must
happen
as
a
finality
in
a
case
in
any
type
of
case
simply
because
someone
thinks
it
might
have
happened.
no
conclusion
as
to
this
happened
or
this
didn't
happen,
i
think
that
would
raise
a
due
process
question.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
yes.
i
think
that's
true,
but
i
think
if
you're
going
to
hold
out
from
all
your
cases
those
which
to
which
you
must
apply
the
standard
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
i
only
see
two
basis
for
selecting
the
juvenile
delinquency
proceeding.
it's
falling
into
that
category.
one,
either
that
it's
so
akin
to
the
criminal
case
that
requires
it
or
two,
that's
a
proceeding
which
may
lead
to
loss
of
liberty
and
therefore
requires
it.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
that
depends
upon
whether
you're
going
to
say
that
any
attempt
to
make
reform,
you
just
look
through
it
and
we
had
at
rhode
island
a
judge
who
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
appellant
seeks
and
in
his
opinion,
he
said
the
murder
is
murder,
burglary
is
burglary
and
we
must
recognize
it,
but
that's
exactly
what
the
juvenile
court
system
was
aimed
to
prevent.
it
was
a
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
there
is
no
question
that
under
the
new
york
law,
to
start
a
juvenile
delinquency
proceeding,
you
must
charge
someone
with
an
act
which
have
committed
by
an
adult
would
constitute
a
crime.
now,
i'm
going
to
suggest
that
this
constitutional
question
cannot
depend
upon
that
because
suppose
new
york
passes
a
law
next
year,
lumps
persons
in
need
of
supervision
and
the
present
juvenile
proceeding
on
under
a
title
deviant
conduct,
deviant
conduct
and
says
that
you
can
bring
this
proceeding
and
show
that
the
child's
conduct
deviates
from
what
is
regarded
as
a
desirable
norm
and
then
proceed.
i
don't
think
that
change
would
make
something
constitutional
which
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
either
even
though
the
deviating
conduct
would
be
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
well,
but
the
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
i
concede
that,
that
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
i
don't
think
there
was
an
issue
about
it.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
not
solely
because
he
is
12
years
old,
but
because
being
12
years
old,
this
is
not
regarded
as
a
crime
and
he
is
not
being
treated
as
a
criminal.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
that's
right
and
in
this
proceeding,
the
things
that
occur
in
this
proceeding
are
not
to
be
distorted
as
the
equivalent
of
his
having
been
charged
with
a
crime
or
having
been
found
guilty
of
a
crime
and
that's
why
it's
labeled
a
fact
finding
determination
and
then
you
have
a
dispositional
hearing
which
is
not
a
suspended
sentence.
no
matter
what
the
child
did,
no
matter
how
if
it
serious
a
crime
that
would
have
been
done,
considered
if
committed
by
an
adult,
a
clear
cut
evidence
the
child
did
it,
if
they
find
that
this
child
does
not
need
confinement
or
supervision
to
avoid
this
happening
again
or
avoid
similar
conduct
happening
again,
he
is
not
found
to
be
a
juvenile
delinquent
and
the
case
would
have
been
dismissed.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
that's
right,
your
honor
and
there's
no
such
thing
as
waiving
to
the
criminal
court
in
new
york.
no
such
thing
at
all
as
long
as
the
charge
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
he
can
be
confined
in
appropriate
institution
for
a
limited
period
which
after
being
reviewed
maybe
extended
to
a
longer
period
where
if
the
child
is
12
could
possibly
be
extended.
there
is
time
to
succeed
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
exactly.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
or
insane,
you
also
can
be
confined
in
the
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
but
also
just
to
point
out
the
types
of
distinctions,
the
civil
commitment
at
least
in
new
york
and
i
think
in
many
other
states
does
not
require
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
new
york
limits
civil
commitments
generally,
but
other
the
states
do
not
limit
the
period
of
times
as
much
in
new
york.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
the
answer
is
no.
everything
that
was
found
to
be
wrong
in
the
gault
case,
new
york
by
statute
had
cured
long
before
the
gault
case.
i
will
not
attempt
to
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
it
said
that
the
child
need
not
to
--
could
remain
silent.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
it
said
that
the
child
may
remain
silent.
that
was
the
one
aspect
in
which
the
gault
case
did
touch
upon
this
as
though
it
was
an
issue
of
due
process
which
would
--
as
to
all
other
aspects
as
spoken
by
due
process
and
civil
or
criminal
cases
required
certain
things.
in
this
respect,
it
said
that
this
was
analogous
to
a
criminal
case.
although
it
went
on
immediately
after
it
showed
that
that
remark
was
unnecessary
because
in
arizona
the
child
still
could
have
been
waived
to
a
criminal
court
and
tried
on
a
criminal
basis.
well,
what
i
suggest
and
i'm
not
going
to
attempt
to
cover
all
of
the
various
aspects
in
which
this
juvenile
court
in
new
york
differs
from
a
criminal
court,
but
there
are
these
differences.
there
is
not
this
finding
of
guilt
as
we're
told
and
while
the
places
of
confinement
may
be
not
be
ideal
and
much
can
be
done
to
prove
it.
we
do
find
in
new
york,
there
is
a
constant
restudy
on
this
field,
there
is
a
constant
attempt
to
improve
far
too
slow,
far
too
slow
and
often
inadequate,
but
there
are
constant
changes
and
while
i
hesitate
to
speak
of
the
manner
of
confinement
without
knowing
precisely
and
it
wasn't
evident
from
the
record,
the
brief
of
the
attorney
general,
submitted,
does
point
out
and
i'm
not
saying
that
anyone
is
willing
to
go
to
these
places,
that
the
training
schools
operate
under
a
college
unit
system
which
generally
is
made
up
of
semi-independent
groups,
many
of
which
a
limited
to
20
young
people
that
there
are
in
an
open
setting
without
the
restraint
of
locks
or
bars,
that
house
parents
live
on
the
premises
and
act
as
guides
and
mentors
as
well
as
supervisors,
that
home
visits
are
made
by
the
boys
and
girls
on
a
regular
basis
and
vocational
academic
features
are
provided.
now,
perhaps
this
is
the
idea
that
they
aim
at
and
perhaps
they
don't
always
comply
but
this
is
what
they're
trying
to
do.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
yes
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
exactly.
now,
mr.
justice
marshall
has
suggested
that
the
mere
fact
that
this
starts
off
because
of
an
act
which
would
constitute
a
crime,
everything
flows
to
it.
i
think
that's
a
suggestion
and
it
must
be
treated
as
a
crime
and
all
these
trimmings
that
you're
putting
on
and
all
you've
got
is
a
criminal
court
trying
a
criminal
case
to
put
somebody
of
way
as
you
do
in
the
criminal
court
and
therefore
at
least
in
approach,
in
answer
to
that
approach,
i
think
it's
important
to
consider
every
element
from
the
intake
procedure
where
even
though
a
petition
is
drawn
up
which
says
that
the
child
committed
an
act
which
would
be
a
crime
by
an
adult
and
a
substantial
portion
of
the
case
is
they
review
this
and
never
even
reaches
a
fact
finding
stage
and
they
decide
even
though
the
evidence
is
there,
this
doesn't
call
for
juvenile
delinquency
proceeding
in
this
child.
through
the
dispositional
hearing,
where
after
the
evidence
may
be
proved
on
a
basis
which
go
far
beyond
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
an
absolute
certainty,
nevertheless,
there
is
no
finding
of
juvenile
delinquency
because
the
child
doesn't
need
confinement
or
supervision.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
yes
but
i'm
suggesting
that
all
these
elements
should
be
considered
in
deciding
whether
this
is
really
a
criminal
proceeding.
now,
if
the
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
i
can
only
respond
this
way.
that
when
this
started
off,
judge
julian
mack,
rascoe
pound
and
others,
who
are
the
strong
proponents
of
the
children's
court,
certainly
did
not
think
that
they
had
found
a
way
of
evading
constitutional
requirements
with
respect
to
criminal
law
and
i
respectfully
submit
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
well,
i
hardly
thought
so
until
your
honor
suggested
me.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
and
what
i
--
what
i
thought
i
was
trying
to
do
was
to
try
to
analyze
whether
there
is
a
constitutional
requirement
that
in
this
type
of
proceeding,
there
must
be
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
didn't
think
i
was
trying
to
distort
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
and
i
thought
i
was
trying
to
analyze
as
to
whether
a
juvenile
delinquency
court,
the
juvenile
proceeding
as
designed
by
its
original
proponents
as
revised
over
the
years
with
attempts
to
have
due
process
requirements
is
subject
to
a
further
constitutional
requirement
that
you
must
prove
the
wrong
doing
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
or
the
improper
conduct
beyond
a
reasonable
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
put
this,
your
honor.
put
it
–
he
is
charged
with
a
crime
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
i
have
found
no
case
that
decides
that
issue.
i
would
be
inclined
to
think
that
this
court
probably
if
faced
with
that
issue
would
reach
the
conclusion
that
must
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
think,
it
would
say
that
since
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
perhaps
i
misread
it.
i
didn't
quite
read
it
that
way.
i
thought
he
was
saying
that
this
is
a
requirement
of
the,
that
it
become
so
habitual
in
this
country,
that
it
was
necessary
but
perhaps
i
misread
it.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
i'm
afraid
i'm
a
little
dull
on
that
because
there's
no
claim
here
that
the
child
is
required
to
give
any
evidence
against
himself.
now
what
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
that
is
the
essence
of
the
question
there
and
that's
why
i
keep
speaking
about
whether
this
is
truly
a
criminal
proceeding
and
why
i
suggest
that
you
can't
decide
that
it's
a
criminal
proceeding
just
because
the
trigger
that's
starts
it
off
is
an
act
which
if
done
by
an
adult
would
be
a
crime.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
but
certainly
that's
the
intent
of
the
new
york
law.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
well,
i
think
in
justice
to
the
other
side,
if
that
were
a
deliberate
intent
to
mislead
or
even
if
would
not
deliberate,
if
in
fact
what
you
really
had
was
a
criminal
case
than
just
labeling
it
is
not
being
criminal
case
would
not
get
by,
but
it's
not
merely
the
label,
it's
not
merely
calling
in
a
civil
proceeding
that
makes
it
any
less
a
criminal
case.
the
question
is,
looking
at
the
thing
as
a
whole
from
beginning
to
end
in
every
feature
of
it,
is
this
a
criminal
proceeding
and
i
submit
that
while
you
may
find
a
juvenile
court
set
up
in
some
states,
where
you'd
reach
the
conclusion,
this
is
nothing
but
a
criminal
proceeding
that
you
cannot
so
find
in
new
york.
now,
it's
also
been
suggested,
certainly
in
my
arguments
that
if
you
reach
this
conclusion
you
must
end
up
with
the
jury
trial
in
the
juvenile
courts
and
if
you
reach
it
on
the
basis
of
this
being
a
criminal
proceeding.
and
my
suggestion
that
if
you
base
it
on
loss
of
the
liberty
that
this
may
have
an
impact
on
the
insanity
proceedings
and
the
narcotic
addicts
proceedings
and
the
civil
contempt
proceeding
and
not
the
issues
before
this
court
but
i
submit
that
in
this
case,
the
court
will
decide
which
path
will
be
taken
down
the
certain
hill
and
it's
hard
for
me
to
conceive
ever
going
back
up
that
hill.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
as
i
understand
it's
preponderance
of
evidence
as
in
the
other
proceeding,
any
other
civil
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
now
--
well,
also
i
might
mention
at
this
point
that
there's
been
a
good
deal
of
emphasis
on
well,
this
child
might
have
been
confined
for
six
years
and
if
he
were
an
adult
it
would
only
be
five
years.
this
may
happenstance
because
the
adult
who
might
have
been
confined
for
life,
the
child
does
the
same
act
and
he's
14
years
old
can
at
most
be
confined
for
four
years.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
that's
as
far
as
we
can
determine
from
the
court
records.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
i
would
hesitate
to
suggest
that
there
is
mootness.
this
is
at
least
i
think
even
if
it
were
moot
it
would
come
under
the
rule
that
a
recurring
problem
should
be
disposed
of,
recurring
problem
of
public
importance.
secondly,
the
suggestion
is
made
by
the
appellants
that
even
though
there
is
all
this
confidentialities,
somehow,
someway,
it
may
leak
out
and
this
casts
a
reflection
on
the
child
which
argument
if
accepted
might
pull
it
out
of
the
mootness
area.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
i
can't
even
speak
about
the
first
risk.
see,
that's
one
of
the
difficulties
in
this
case
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
yes
but
i
don't
know
how
they
know.
somebody
found
out
in
the
district
of
columbia
that
there
is
such
a
risk
and
there
seems
to
be
an
assumption
that
there
is
such
a
risk
in
new
york.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
to
the
sentencing
judge,
yes.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
that
is
correct.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
i'm
afraid
that
i
don't
know
the
answer.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
from
all
i
can
hear
he
is
not
given
any
such
information.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
even
on
request.
i
just
don't
know
about
the
military
and
i
hesitate
to
ask
because
there
was
no
one
i
could
ask
who
would
give
me
an
answer
that
i
would
feel
assured
of
is
certainty.
so,
if
i
got
the
answer
that
would
be
favorable
to
my
position,
i
might
be
misleading
the
court
if
i
gave
my
answer.
i
do
--
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
yes.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
well,
here's
what
happened,
he
went
away
and
after
he
was
away
for
10
months,
he
was
allowed
to
live
with
his
parents.
then
apparently
as
they
put
it
in
the
docket,
he
absconded
from
his
parents'
home
and
was
picked
up
on
a
direction
that
he
sent
away
for
a
year.
that
year
period
has
passed
and
there
is
nothing
on
the
record
to
indicate
that
anything
further
has
been
done,
any
other
attempt
to
confine
him.
mr.
stanley
buchsbaum
as
far
as
under
this
charge
or
apparently
under
any
other
charges
as
far
as
we
can
find
from
the
records.
i
gather
my
time
is
up.
