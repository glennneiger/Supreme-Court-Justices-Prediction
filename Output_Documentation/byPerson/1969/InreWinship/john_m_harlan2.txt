you
recall
of
any
case
in
this
court
similar
with
what
the
court
has
said
at
least
without
standard
in
federal
case
constitutes
then?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
have
to
go
no
further
in
this
case
to
prevail
and
say
that
where
the
charge
against
the
delinquent
is
a
criminal
charge,
a
charge,
an
act
which
is
committed
by
an
adult,
it
would
be
a
crime
that
if
no
circumstances
you'd
be
proofed
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
or
whatever
label
you
put
on
it
is
required.
you
don't
have
to
go
any
further
than
that,
do
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
might
want
to
but
you
don't
have
to.

who
was
the
trial
judge?
justice
john
m.
harlan
who
was
the
trial
judge?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
a
lot
of
them
in
court
of
appeals,
judge
fuld,
heaney
and
somebody
else.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you've
been
making
the
same
argument
surely,
wouldn't
you
and
disagreed
on
both
sides
of
the
physical
facilities
of
these
institutions
as
pertinent?
justice
john
m.
harlan
let
me
ask
you
a
question,
supposing
now,
you
say
there's
no
due
process
question
here,
supposing
new
york
passed
a
law
saying
our
juvenile
calendar
load
is
very,
very
heavy
and
we
will
amend
our
laws
so
that
these
children
who
may
be
in
trouble
need
supervision
and
need
something.
they
can
be
found
juvenile
delinquents
upon
the
judge
finding
that
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
they
are.
would
you
think
that
was
it?
do
you
think
that'll
raise
a
question
under
the
due
process
clause?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
think
it
would?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
judge
has
a
smell
for
it
and
he
thinks
the
chances
are
pretty
good
that
this
youngster
is
a
juvenile
delinquent
and
that
would
be
enough
under
the
hypothetical
statute
i'm
talking
about.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
it
would?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
says
it
does
except
the
due
process
clause?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
gault
case
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
then
that
problem
doesn't
arise
in
this
case
wasn't
it
as
i
was
saying?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
happens
if
the
prospected
employer
who
wants
to
know
whether
the
child
or
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
about
the
military?
even
on
request?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
have
one
question
chief
justice
and
i'd
like
to
ask
a
little
collateral
agreement.

attorney's
office

they
have

in
the
mootness
question
mrs.
uviller.
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
had
been
released
before
we
noted
problem
of
jurisdiction?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
do.
it
is
clear,
isn't
it
and
you
don't
dispute
that
these
appellant
have
been
released
from
custody
and
was
released
from
custody
indeed
before
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction,

that
it?
