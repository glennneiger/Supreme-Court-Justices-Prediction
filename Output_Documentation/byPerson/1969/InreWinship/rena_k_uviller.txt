ms.
rena
k.
uviller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
first
clear
opportunity
for
the
court
to
determine
one
of
the
implications
of
a
landmark
case
in
re
gault.
it
affords
on
a
good
record,
an
opportunity
which
this
court
sought,
but
was
unable
to
seize
most
recently
in
the
case
of
debacker
versus
brainard,
an
opportunity
to
determine
whether
a
juvenile,
maybe
found
guilty
of
a
law
violation
and
confined
for
a
number
of
years
unless
been
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
is
on
proof
less
than
that
customarily
considered,
the
highest
measure
of
proof
in
criminal
proceedings.
in
this
case,
the
12-year
old
appellate
was
found
guilty
of
an
act
of
larceny
in
violation
of
the
new
york
penal
law
and
while
he
could
have
been
confined
for
a
maximum
of
five
years,
had
he
been
an
adult,
he
faced
a
maximum
confinement
of
six
years
because
he
was
tried
in
a
juvenile
proceeding
in
the
new
york
family
court.
the
determination
that
he
was
guilty
of
this
act
of
larceny
was
based
expressly
upon
the
provision
of
the
new
york
statute
which
provides
for
such
finding
by
mere
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
the
issue
arose
briefly
in
the
following
context.
the
juvenile
was
tried
in
a
fact-finding
hearing
in
the
family
court
and
at
that
hearing,
the
complainant,
a
saleslady
testified
that
one
night
she
was
at
work
and
while
the
store
was
open
for
business,
she
and
her
coworkers
did
not
believe
any
other
people
were
in
the
premises,
that
they
were
no
costumers
present.
however,
she
became
alerted
at
some
point
that
a
lavatory
door
in
the
back
of
the
premises
was
locked
and
a
moment
or
two
later,
the
door
opened
and
a
young
boy
scooted
out
of
the
store
and
out
into
the
street.
the
lady
testified
that
she
really
had
at
the
most
10
seconds
to
observe
him
in
profile
as
he
darted
by
and
she
saw
him
from
a
distance
of
about
20
feet.
she
then
proceeded
into
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes,
your
honor
but
in
this
case
really
it
emerged
that
she
knew
this
boy
previously,
not
at
that
time
but
she
was
confronted
by
him
in
a
one-to-one
confrontation
the
next
night
in
the
police
station.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
indicate
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
well,
it's
unclear
from
this
record
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
family
court
judge,
in
finding
a
boy
guilty,
conceded
that
there
was
a
reasonable
doubt
in
this
case
about
i
don't
--
it's
unclear
as
to
whether
he
was
--
what
the
doubt
was
about
that
the
lady
had
an
opportunity
to
see
him
or
when
she
made
the
determination
that
this
was
someone
that
she
had
known
previously.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
she
said
--
after
she
saw
the
boy
scoot
out
she
called
the
police
office
and
she
was
then
called
to
the
police
station
the
next
night
where
she
saw
the
boy
and
she
testified
in
court
that
she
knew
this
boy
very
well.
and
she
said
that
she
had
seen
him
on
many
previous
occasions
when
he
had
come
to
her
store
and
that
she
had
thrown
him
out
as
a
matter
of
fact.
the
boy
of
course
and
his
mother
and
his
uncle
all
testified
that
he
was
not
at
all
--
that
he
was
home
and
could
not
possibly
have
been
out
of
his
house
that
entire
evening
and
testified
to
an
alibi.
he
of
course
also
denied
that
he
ever
knew
this
lady
before,
but
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
here
for
us
to
again
consider
what
entered
into
the
fact
finder's
mind
when
he
was
making
this
determination.
he
did
assess
the
credibility
of
various
witnesses
and
had
before
him
the
fact
that
the
lady
did
see
him
in
an
inherently
suggestive
situation
the
next
night
and
determine
that
he
did
have
a
reasonable
doubt
about
this
boy's
guilt.
this
was
quite
developed
in
a
record
and
the
judge
most
candidly
noted
that
he
was
applying
a
different
standard
of
proof
then
would
have
applied
in
adult
situation
and
that
therefore
the
finding
was
not
ascertain.
and
i
would
submit
that
at
this
point,
what
we
are
here
to
consider
is
the
appropriateness
of
the
measure
of
proof
that
the
fact
finder
applied
as
opposed
to
what
went
into
his
determination
that
the
child
was
guilty
by
the
standard
the
he
applied.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
that's
right,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
would
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
mr.
justice
harlan
there
is
no
express
holding
to
that
effect,
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
reason
of
that
is
so
is
that
this
so
widespread
standard,
it
has
such
fundamental
antecedents
that
holding
to
that
effect
has
never
been
necessary.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes
it
is,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
say
at
the
outset
that
to
seek
a
denomination
of
the
proceeding
here
involved,
either
civil
or
criminal,
would
be
futile
and
would
really
only
obscure
the
question
that
we
have
to
deal
with
because
it
is
our
basic
contention
that
whatever
we
call
these
proceedings,
juvenile
proceedings,
to
find
a
child
guilty
of
law
violation
and
to
incarcerate
him
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
unless,
unless
then
the
most
certain
standard
of
proof
known
to
our
law
is
a
violation
of
due
process
and
it
is
a
violation
of
due
process,
i
would
submit,
however
that
concept
maybe
defined.
whether
it
is
as
in
mr.
justice
black's,
view
the
law
of
the
land
where
an
adult
is
accused
of
a
crime
and
confined
or
whether
it
is
considered
the
fundamental
fairness
of
the
proceedings
and
although
much
has
been
said
by
this
court
and
other
courts
about
the
fairness
of
this
standard
where
liberty
is
at
stake
for
law
violation,
i
would
just
like
to
reiterate
a
couple
of
considerations
and
that
is
the
standard
after
all
expresses
an
attempt
to
reduce
the
chance
of
risk
when
an
innocent
person
is
going
to
be
convicted.
it
is
a
flag
as
it
were
to
the
fact
finder
that
you
must
be
very,
very
certain
that
this
is
the
person
that
did
the
act
and
in
fact
as
this
court
noted
in
coffin
against
the
united
states
many
times,
many
years
ago,
it
is
really
in
fact
a
corollary
to
the
presumption
of
innocence
and
i
would
doubt
that
anyone
would
suggest
that
that
most
fundamental
presumption
should
not
attach
to
somebody
who
is
accused
merely
because
of
his
age
and
of
course
a
reasonable
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
mr.
chief
justice,
yes
precisely
and
we
make
no
challenge
to
the
policy
of
a
legislature,
which
seems
to
be
uniformed
throughout
the
country,
to
establish
separate
courts
apart
from
the
criminal
process
to
try
and
deal
with
young
offenders.
we
don't
challenge
the
assumptions
on
which
that
legislative
policy
is
based.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
he
was
found
guilty
of
a
law
violation.
my
only
contention
is
that
within
these
specialized
courts,
designed
as
you
suggest
to
save
youngsters
before
they
become
perhaps
“non-rehabilitatable,”
if
there's
such
a
word,
to
offer
them
special
kinds
of
services,
but
we
only
ask
that
within
these
special
courts
the
limitations
of
the
constitution
apply,
so
that
fundamental
fairness
is
recognized
and
observed.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes
and
i
think
a
child,
a
young
offender,
is
indeed
entitled
to
that
and
i
would
like
to
just
for
a
moment
deal
with
one
of
the
contentions
that
the
city
has
raised
about
this
confinement
procedure.
the
city
of
new
york
has
suggested
well,
there
are
other
kinds
of
confinement
that
are
based
upon
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
suggest
this
is
--
does
not
differ
from
those
kinds
of
confinement.
and
the
city
cites
such
things
as
the
confinement
of
mentally
ill
people
and
alcoholics
and
narcotics
addicts
and
i
would
say
that
it
really
strains
the
analogy
to
compare
this
kind
of
a
case
with
that
kind
of
case.
in
those
cases,
you're
dealing
essentially
with
the
distillation
of
medical
testimony
relating
to
a
physical
or
mental
condition.
expert
opinions,
subject
to
very
honest
differences
of
opinion,
what
is
an
alcoholic
or
how
sick
is
this
person,
but
here
we're
talking
about,
did
johnny
jones
do
x
on
y
night?
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
would
say
that
of
course
there
is
some
distinction
because
in
one
case
we're
talking
about
a
law
violation
and
in
another
case
not
but
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
very
likely
that
he
will.
i
would
say,
however,
that
the
way
the
statute
reads
in
new
york,
there
is
some
question
and
it's
rather
broadly
defined.
however,
as
a
matter
of
practical,
as
a
practical
matter,
in
new
york,
the
courts
have
required
that
when
someone
is
charged
with
being
a
person
in
need
of
supervision
that
he's
incorrigible,
that
one
may
not
merely
accuse
him
of
being
incorrigible
that
one
must
charge
specific
acts
of
misconduct.
one
must
show
that
johnny
jones
was
out
away
from
home
for
two
weeks
from
such
and
such
date
to
another
date,
that
he
has
been
drinking
intoxicating
beverages,
that
he's
associating
with
bad
company
namely,
sam
smith
etcetera,
etcetera,
and
that
must
be
proved.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
no,
i
--
it
would
not
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
only
implication
of
the
case
today
is
that
perhaps
the
pins
case
has
says
they're
called
should
also
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
i
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes
and
the
reason
i
suggest
that
is
that
again
although
it
has
no
corollary
in
the
criminal
law,
it
is
an
allegation
of
misconduct
and
would
seem
intolerable
for
two
boys
to
be
in
precisely
of
the
same
institutions;
one,
on
a
higher
standard
of
proof,
one
on
the
lower
standard
of
proof,
both
having
been
found
guilty
of
misconduct.
and
i
would
also
think
perhaps
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
well,
in
only
to
that
extent.
the
city
has
suggested
in
its
brief,
well,
if
this
court
finds
today
that
a
finding
of
wrong
doing
must
meet
high
standards
of
reliability,
that
means
the
whole
panoply
of
criminal
procedures
will
apply,
that
means
it
will
be
jury
trials
and
every
other
protection.
i
maintain
that
it's
absolutely
not
so.
this
is
an
entirely
separable
issue.
it
is
perfectly
possible
for
this
court
to
find
that
it
is
required
as
a
matter
of
fundamental
fairness
that
the
fact
finder
to
be
very
certain
of
the
child's
guilt
and
not
accord
or
determine
any
one
of
these
other
protections.
it
may
well
be
that
this
court
will
at
some
time
determine
that
these
other
things
are
necessary,
but
certainly
not
as
a
result
to
this
case.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
precisely,
yes
sir.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
i
would
say
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
you
don't
have
to,
right.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
no,
your
honor.
i
think
if
i
may
say,
i
think
that
the
intention
of
the
reformers
when
the
juvenile
system
began
in
this
country
at
the
turn
of
the
century
was
to
try
to
bring
to
bear
upon
the
young
offender
whatever
notions
of
psychology,
sociology,
rehabilitating
and
early
training
that
was
possible
and
deemed
it
advisable
to
do
these
in
separate
courts
with
different
procedures
and
i'm
not
quarreling
with
that.
i
think
that
that
is
perfectly
appropriate
but
i
think
maybe
at
this
point,
it's
important
to
note
that
that
hope
of
the
reformers
will
not
be
affected
by
finding
that,
that
fact
finder
be
very
sure
that
the
child
has
demonstrated
in
need
for
those
rehabilitative
services
and
perhaps
describing
the
new
york
system
would
best
explain
how
this
works
and
why
the
finding
--
the
holding
that
we
urge
today
will
not
detract
from
what
you
concede
up
as
the
efforts
of
the
juvenile
system
to
rehabilitate
youngsters.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
say
that
this
finding,
this
--
what
we
are
urging
today
is
really
even
more
fundamental
than
the
rights
accorded
to
children
in
gault.
i
would
say
that
to
ask
the
fact
finder
to
be
very
sure
that
the
child
has
committed
the
act
which
indicates
he
needs
rehabilitation,
that
he'd
be
very
certain
of
that,
will
change
the
court
in
it's
everyday
functioning
much
less
than
for
example
according
a
child
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
that
goes
much
closer
to
changing
the
posture
of
the
court
perhaps
not
in
new
york
but
elsewhere
than
a
simple
requirement
that
before
you
give
the
child
these
services,
and
there
is
some
debate
as
to
how
effective
they
are,
you
must
be
very
sure
that
he
really
needs
them,
that
he
has
committed
that
robbery
that
shows
that
he
needs
help.
in
new
york,
for
example,
if
i
may
explain
for
a
moment
the
hearing
is
bifurcated
one.
it's
a
two-stage
proceeding.
a
child
is
brought
to
the
fact
finding
hearing.
there,
he's
given
a
petition
which
has
the
charge
in
it
and
the
judge
hears
the
fact,
he
may
only
consider
competent,
relevant,
and
material
evidence.
no
social
history
is
permitted
of
the
judge
at
that
time
by
new
york
statute.
they
can
have
big
case
on
his
family's
problems
and
the
boy's
psychiatric
history
but
the
judge
may
not
see
it.
he
must
make
an
independent
determination
whether
the
boy
committed
this
act
or
not.
once
that
finding
of
guilt
is
made,
the
child
then
must
attend
what
is
known
as
a
dispositional
hearing.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
it
would
be
a
euphemism
to
call
it
anything
else
than
that.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
it's
called
a
fact
finding.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
well,
mr.
chief
justice
they
were
but
i
think
gault
quite
documented
the
fact
that
the
hopes
that
the
child
would
unequivocally
stand
to
benefit
from
these
procedures.
it
has
not
been
realized
and
i
don't
think
here
it
would
appropriate
to
go
into
a
reevaluation
of
how
successful
the
system
has
been
in
new
york.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
well,
i
would
like
to
say
in
that
respect
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
stressed
the
benefits
to
the
juvenile
of
these
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
it
has
made
that
evaluation
and
therefore
i
–-
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
a
sound
legislative
evaluation
that
that
the
–-
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
well,
i
think
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
amend
it.
we're
only
saying
that
within
the
legislative
structure,
the
elements
of
fair
play
prevail.
simply
that
i
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
that's
precisely
right,
mr.
justice
marshall.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
that's
right.
i
want,
we
want
as
it
has
been
suggested,
the
best
of
both
worlds.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
that's
right.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
that's
right.
i
think
a
word
should
be
said.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
pardon
me.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
it
was
a
judge
of
the
family
court,
judge
madonick
who's
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
judge
fuld,
judge
heaney
and
judge
burke,
i
believe.
i
would
like
to
just
make
one
note
about
the
alleged
benefits
that
the
court
of
appeals
stressed
in
its
opinion.
the
court
of
appeals
in
discussing
the
advantages
of
the
trial
of
this
so-called
secrecy
and
non-stigma
of
the
proceedings,
neglected
of
course
to
underscore
the
harsh
reality
that
when
a
child
is
found
guilty
in
this
court,
he
is
subjected
to
substantial
confinement
and
the
facilities
which
even
in
new
york
are
subject
to
a
great
deal
of
criticism.
now,
the
city
in
its
brief
has
a
compounded
this
omission
by
the
court
of
appeals
by
again
stressing
the
benefits
of
the
new
york
system
without
--
and
suggest
of
the
problems
with
the
institutions
have
never
been
shown
to
be
relevant
to
new
york
and
the
attorney
general
in
his
amicus
brief
doubly
compounds
this
by
actually
suggesting
that
this
is
summer
camp
and
that
children
just
can't
wait
to
go
to
the
training
school.
i
would
say
here
that
we
would
insist
that
the
standard
of
proof
be
high
even
if
these
were
model
institutions,
but
i
cannot
let
the
suggestion
of
the
attorney
general
go
un-contradicted
at
this
point.
a
recent
study
by
the
new
york
community
service
society,
one
of
the
oldest,
private
service
organizations
in
new
york,
has
issued
a
report
indicating
that
the
facilities
in
new
york
are
very
poor
indeed,
that
rehabilitation
and
counseling
range
from
token
to
nonexistent,
that
there
are
inadequate
provisions
not
only
for
vocational
training
but
for
even
ordinary
schooling.
that
there
are
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
i
only
--
i
only
raised
them
here
your
honor
because
it
has
been
suggested
by
my
adversary
that
all
theses
criticisms
that
would
make
it
question
of
fundamental
fairness
to
have
a
high
standards
of
proof
are
not
relevant
in
new
york
because
new
york's
institutions
are
so
marvelous
and
i
would
just
suggest
this
is
totally
contrary
to
the
fact
and
that
there
is
out
--
in
short,
there's
ample
a
basis
for
the
conclusion
of
the
community
service
society
that
the
children
in
these
institutions
validly
view
their
stay
there
as
doing
time.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes
they
do.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes
they
do
indeed.
i
would
say
roughly
half
or
not
quite
half
of
the
children
in
the,
i
believe,
in
these
institutions
are
there
as
persons
in
need
of
supervision.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
that's
right.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
and
no
judgment
they're
delinquent.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
neglected
children
are
sent
to
completely
separate
institutions
and
while
i'm
sure
there
is
again
always
room
for
improvement
in
these
facilities,
these
are
not
locked
shelters.
and
a
--
finding
that
a
child
has
committed
a
violation
of
law
also
subjects
him
to
a
temporary
detention.
there
is
--
there
are
statistics
to
the
effect
that
some
35%
of
the
children
who
are
found
guilty
of
law
violations
spend
some
time
in
the
temporary
detention
facility
and
of
those
some
40%
i
believe
are
there
beyond
30
days.
now,
it
takes
just
one
visit
to
that
detention
facility
in
new
york
to
convince
one
that
we're
not
talking
about
an
open,
free
shelter
for
little
children.
it
is
a
facility
where
you
cannot
walk
30
feet
but
that
the
custodian
doesn't
have
to
unlock
the
doors
to
let
you
go
through
the
corridors
and
children
are
locked
into
their
rooms
at
night.
now,
there
are
various
branches.
there
are
some
facilities
that
are
somewhat
more
open
for
the
younger
children,
but
the
essential
facility
in
bronx
county
is
the
kind
that
i
described
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
i
would,
i
would
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
would
say
that
we
want
without
arguing
about
although
i
have
been
arguing
about
the
inadequacy
of
the
facilities
but
even
assuming
they
were
a
model
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
well,
it
helps
it
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes
[attempt
to
laughter].
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes.
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
i'm
only
trying
to
somewhat
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes.
yes
it
is.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
that's
right.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
nothing
would
prohibit
it.
i
would
think
we're
determining
what
is
concept
of
a
fair
trial.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes
you
do,
i
would
say.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes
i
am.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
well,
there's
a
fact
finding
and
then
he
goes
to
disposition
at
this
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
i
would
say
that
even
if
there
is,
even
if
it
is
assumed
after
dispositional
hearing
that
he
does
not
require
the
supervision
of
the
court
and
he's
dismissed
therefore,
there
is
still
a
finding
of
guilt
against
him
and
that
finding
of
guilt
carries
with
it
the
same
stigma
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
well,
it
is
expressed
that
he
has
been
found
guilty
of
a
certain
criminal
act
or
an
act,
which
would
be
a
crime.
however,
we
do
not
adjudicate
him
a
delinquent
because
he
has
not
demonstrated
that
he
needs
confinement
or
supervision.
however,
the
effect
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
no,
he
might
not
--
it's
like
a
suspended
judgment.
i
would
suggest
it's
very
much
like
a
--
like
a
suspended
sentence.
the
child
is
determined
to
have
committed
act
but
it
is
dismissed,
so-called
because
he
does
not
require
probation
say.
however,
in
future
years,
when
these
records
become
pertinent
in
his
life,
as
in
the
military,
all
schools
have
a
record
of
these
proceedings,
they
will
check
and
they
will
know
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes,
i
would
say
so
and
i
would
say
your
honor,
it
is
a
very,
analogous
to
the
specht
v.
patterson
kind
of
cases
where
the
court
is
required
to
hold
a
separate
hearing
to
determine
whether
the
individual
will
have
a
certain
special
kind
of
sentence
imposed
upon
him,
but
this
does
not
reduce
the
state's
burden
to
provide
the
--
to
prove
the
underlying
law
violation
by
a
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
the
suggestion
by
the
city
that
this
two-stage
proceeding
somehow
relieves
the
state
of
proving
the
underlying
act
by
the
highest
standard
of
proof
is
really
essentially
an
unsound
one.
in
sum,
we're
merely
suggesting
that
let
the
state
services
whether
they're
good
or
bad
be
reserved
for
children
against
to
whom
it's
been
demonstrated
really
require
them
by
having
prove
the
acts,
requires
such
rehabilitation.
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
thank
you.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
no,
your
honor.
where
the
petitioner
or
the
complainant
is
a
police
officer,
a
representative
of
the
legal
bureau
of
the
police
department
of
the
city
of
new
york
has
been
serving
as
the
prosecuting
attorney.
there
were
any
questions
about
mootness
i
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
well,
i'd
like
to
say
when
notice
of
appeal
was
filed
to
this
court,
this
child
was
under
confinement
and
he
was
discharged
from
confinement
i
believe
10
days
or
two
weeks
before
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
which
was
some
seven
months
i
believe
after
notice
of
appeal
was
filed
in
this
court.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
he
was
released
two
weeks
before
you
noted
probable
jurisdiction
but
seven
months
after,
the
notice
of
appeal
was
filed
to
this
court
and
as
far
as
the
mootness
question
is
concerned
in
dealing
with
sibron
criteria,
i
would
say
that
the
military
does
know
about
these
things.
it
does
have
an
effect.
one
need
only
go
into
family
court.
i've
seen
the
stack
of
requisitions
from
the
military
which
have
requested
information
because
the
child
is
asked
to
disclose
it
or
otherwise
he
doesn't
qualify.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
it's
not
a
violation
because
the
law
only
says,
the
court,
the
record
shall
not
be
open
to
indiscriminate
public
review,
but
the
court
in
its
discretion
may
reveal
it
to
anybody
and
it
is
done
both
in
civil
service
and
in
the
military
situation.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes,
but
i
would
say
that
the
stigma
is
still
bring
it
within
the
sibron
criteria.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes,
thank
you.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
first
clear
opportunity
for
the
court
to
determine
one
of
the
implications
of
a
landmark
case
in
re
gault.
it
affords
on
a
good
record,
an
opportunity
which
this
court
sought,
but
was
unable
to
seize
most
recently
in
the
case
of
debacker
versus
brainard,
an
opportunity
to
determine
whether
a
juvenile,
maybe
found
guilty
of
a
law
violation
and
confined
for
a
number
of
years
unless
been
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
is
on
proof
less
than
that
customarily
considered,
the
highest
measure
of
proof
in
criminal
proceedings.
in
this
case,
the
12-year
old
appellate
was
found
guilty
of
an
act
of
larceny
in
violation
of
the
new
york
penal
law
and
while
he
could
have
been
confined
for
a
maximum
of
five
years,
had
he
been
an
adult,
he
faced
a
maximum
confinement
of
six
years
because
he
was
tried
in
a
juvenile
proceeding
in
the
new
york
family
court.
the
determination
that
he
was
guilty
of
this
act
of
larceny
was
based
expressly
upon
the
provision
of
the
new
york
statute
which
provides
for
such
finding
by
mere
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
the
issue
arose
briefly
in
the
following
context.
the
juvenile
was
tried
in
a
fact-finding
hearing
in
the
family
court
and
at
that
hearing,
the
complainant,
a
saleslady
testified
that
one
night
she
was
at
work
and
while
the
store
was
open
for
business,
she
and
her
coworkers
did
not
believe
any
other
people
were
in
the
premises,
that
they
were
no
costumers
present.
however,
she
became
alerted
at
some
point
that
a
lavatory
door
in
the
back
of
the
premises
was
locked
and
a
moment
or
two
later,
the
door
opened
and
a
young
boy
scooted
out
of
the
store
and
out
into
the
street.
the
lady
testified
that
she
really
had
at
the
most
10
seconds
to
observe
him
in
profile
as
he
darted
by
and
she
saw
him
from
a
distance
of
about
20
feet.
she
then
proceeded
into
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes,
your
honor
but
in
this
case
really
it
emerged
that
she
knew
this
boy
previously,
not
at
that
time
but
she
was
confronted
by
him
in
a
one-to-one
confrontation
the
next
night
in
the
police
station.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
indicate
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
well,
it's
unclear
from
this
record
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
family
court
judge,
in
finding
a
boy
guilty,
conceded
that
there
was
a
reasonable
doubt
in
this
case
about
i
don't
--
it's
unclear
as
to
whether
he
was
--
what
the
doubt
was
about
that
the
lady
had
an
opportunity
to
see
him
or
when
she
made
the
determination
that
this
was
someone
that
she
had
known
previously.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
she
said
--
after
she
saw
the
boy
scoot
out
she
called
the
police
office
and
she
was
then
called
to
the
police
station
the
next
night
where
she
saw
the
boy
and
she
testified
in
court
that
she
knew
this
boy
very
well.
and
she
said
that
she
had
seen
him
on
many
previous
occasions
when
he
had
come
to
her
store
and
that
she
had
thrown
him
out
as
a
matter
of
fact.
the
boy
of
course
and
his
mother
and
his
uncle
all
testified
that
he
was
not
at
all
--
that
he
was
home
and
could
not
possibly
have
been
out
of
his
house
that
entire
evening
and
testified
to
an
alibi.
he
of
course
also
denied
that
he
ever
knew
this
lady
before,
but
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
here
for
us
to
again
consider
what
entered
into
the
fact
finder's
mind
when
he
was
making
this
determination.
he
did
assess
the
credibility
of
various
witnesses
and
had
before
him
the
fact
that
the
lady
did
see
him
in
an
inherently
suggestive
situation
the
next
night
and
determine
that
he
did
have
a
reasonable
doubt
about
this
boy's
guilt.
this
was
quite
developed
in
a
record
and
the
judge
most
candidly
noted
that
he
was
applying
a
different
standard
of
proof
then
would
have
applied
in
adult
situation
and
that
therefore
the
finding
was
not
ascertain.
and
i
would
submit
that
at
this
point,
what
we
are
here
to
consider
is
the
appropriateness
of
the
measure
of
proof
that
the
fact
finder
applied
as
opposed
to
what
went
into
his
determination
that
the
child
was
guilty
by
the
standard
the
he
applied.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
that's
right,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
would
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
mr.
justice
harlan
there
is
no
express
holding
to
that
effect,
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
reason
of
that
is
so
is
that
this
so
widespread
standard,
it
has
such
fundamental
antecedents
that
holding
to
that
effect
has
never
been
necessary.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes
it
is,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
say
at
the
outset
that
to
seek
a
denomination
of
the
proceeding
here
involved,
either
civil
or
criminal,
would
be
futile
and
would
really
only
obscure
the
question
that
we
have
to
deal
with
because
it
is
our
basic
contention
that
whatever
we
call
these
proceedings,
juvenile
proceedings,
to
find
a
child
guilty
of
law
violation
and
to
incarcerate
him
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
unless,
unless
then
the
most
certain
standard
of
proof
known
to
our
law
is
a
violation
of
due
process
and
it
is
a
violation
of
due
process,
i
would
submit,
however
that
concept
maybe
defined.
whether
it
is
as
in
mr.
justice
black's,
view
the
law
of
the
land
where
an
adult
is
accused
of
a
crime
and
confined
or
whether
it
is
considered
the
fundamental
fairness
of
the
proceedings
and
although
much
has
been
said
by
this
court
and
other
courts
about
the
fairness
of
this
standard
where
liberty
is
at
stake
for
law
violation,
i
would
just
like
to
reiterate
a
couple
of
considerations
and
that
is
the
standard
after
all
expresses
an
attempt
to
reduce
the
chance
of
risk
when
an
innocent
person
is
going
to
be
convicted.
it
is
a
flag
as
it
were
to
the
fact
finder
that
you
must
be
very,
very
certain
that
this
is
the
person
that
did
the
act
and
in
fact
as
this
court
noted
in
coffin
against
the
united
states
many
times,
many
years
ago,
it
is
really
in
fact
a
corollary
to
the
presumption
of
innocence
and
i
would
doubt
that
anyone
would
suggest
that
that
most
fundamental
presumption
should
not
attach
to
somebody
who
is
accused
merely
because
of
his
age
and
of
course
a
reasonable
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
mr.
chief
justice,
yes
precisely
and
we
make
no
challenge
to
the
policy
of
a
legislature,
which
seems
to
be
uniformed
throughout
the
country,
to
establish
separate
courts
apart
from
the
criminal
process
to
try
and
deal
with
young
offenders.
we
don't
challenge
the
assumptions
on
which
that
legislative
policy
is
based.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
he
was
found
guilty
of
a
law
violation.
my
only
contention
is
that
within
these
specialized
courts,
designed
as
you
suggest
to
save
youngsters
before
they
become
perhaps
“non-rehabilitatable,”
if
there's
such
a
word,
to
offer
them
special
kinds
of
services,
but
we
only
ask
that
within
these
special
courts
the
limitations
of
the
constitution
apply,
so
that
fundamental
fairness
is
recognized
and
observed.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes
and
i
think
a
child,
a
young
offender,
is
indeed
entitled
to
that
and
i
would
like
to
just
for
a
moment
deal
with
one
of
the
contentions
that
the
city
has
raised
about
this
confinement
procedure.
the
city
of
new
york
has
suggested
well,
there
are
other
kinds
of
confinement
that
are
based
upon
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
suggest
this
is
--
does
not
differ
from
those
kinds
of
confinement.
and
the
city
cites
such
things
as
the
confinement
of
mentally
ill
people
and
alcoholics
and
narcotics
addicts
and
i
would
say
that
it
really
strains
the
analogy
to
compare
this
kind
of
a
case
with
that
kind
of
case.
in
those
cases,
you're
dealing
essentially
with
the
distillation
of
medical
testimony
relating
to
a
physical
or
mental
condition.
expert
opinions,
subject
to
very
honest
differences
of
opinion,
what
is
an
alcoholic
or
how
sick
is
this
person,
but
here
we're
talking
about,
did
johnny
jones
do
x
on
y
night?
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
would
say
that
of
course
there
is
some
distinction
because
in
one
case
we're
talking
about
a
law
violation
and
in
another
case
not
but
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
very
likely
that
he
will.
i
would
say,
however,
that
the
way
the
statute
reads
in
new
york,
there
is
some
question
and
it's
rather
broadly
defined.
however,
as
a
matter
of
practical,
as
a
practical
matter,
in
new
york,
the
courts
have
required
that
when
someone
is
charged
with
being
a
person
in
need
of
supervision
that
he's
incorrigible,
that
one
may
not
merely
accuse
him
of
being
incorrigible
that
one
must
charge
specific
acts
of
misconduct.
one
must
show
that
johnny
jones
was
out
away
from
home
for
two
weeks
from
such
and
such
date
to
another
date,
that
he
has
been
drinking
intoxicating
beverages,
that
he's
associating
with
bad
company
namely,
sam
smith
etcetera,
etcetera,
and
that
must
be
proved.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
no,
i
--
it
would
not
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
only
implication
of
the
case
today
is
that
perhaps
the
pins
case
has
says
they're
called
should
also
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
i
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes
and
the
reason
i
suggest
that
is
that
again
although
it
has
no
corollary
in
the
criminal
law,
it
is
an
allegation
of
misconduct
and
would
seem
intolerable
for
two
boys
to
be
in
precisely
of
the
same
institutions;
one,
on
a
higher
standard
of
proof,
one
on
the
lower
standard
of
proof,
both
having
been
found
guilty
of
misconduct.
and
i
would
also
think
perhaps
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
well,
in
only
to
that
extent.
the
city
has
suggested
in
its
brief,
well,
if
this
court
finds
today
that
a
finding
of
wrong
doing
must
meet
high
standards
of
reliability,
that
means
the
whole
panoply
of
criminal
procedures
will
apply,
that
means
it
will
be
jury
trials
and
every
other
protection.
i
maintain
that
it's
absolutely
not
so.
this
is
an
entirely
separable
issue.
it
is
perfectly
possible
for
this
court
to
find
that
it
is
required
as
a
matter
of
fundamental
fairness
that
the
fact
finder
to
be
very
certain
of
the
child's
guilt
and
not
accord
or
determine
any
one
of
these
other
protections.
it
may
well
be
that
this
court
will
at
some
time
determine
that
these
other
things
are
necessary,
but
certainly
not
as
a
result
to
this
case.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
precisely,
yes
sir.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
i
would
say
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
you
don't
have
to,
right.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
no,
your
honor.
i
think
if
i
may
say,
i
think
that
the
intention
of
the
reformers
when
the
juvenile
system
began
in
this
country
at
the
turn
of
the
century
was
to
try
to
bring
to
bear
upon
the
young
offender
whatever
notions
of
psychology,
sociology,
rehabilitating
and
early
training
that
was
possible
and
deemed
it
advisable
to
do
these
in
separate
courts
with
different
procedures
and
i'm
not
quarreling
with
that.
i
think
that
that
is
perfectly
appropriate
but
i
think
maybe
at
this
point,
it's
important
to
note
that
that
hope
of
the
reformers
will
not
be
affected
by
finding
that,
that
fact
finder
be
very
sure
that
the
child
has
demonstrated
in
need
for
those
rehabilitative
services
and
perhaps
describing
the
new
york
system
would
best
explain
how
this
works
and
why
the
finding
--
the
holding
that
we
urge
today
will
not
detract
from
what
you
concede
up
as
the
efforts
of
the
juvenile
system
to
rehabilitate
youngsters.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
say
that
this
finding,
this
--
what
we
are
urging
today
is
really
even
more
fundamental
than
the
rights
accorded
to
children
in
gault.
i
would
say
that
to
ask
the
fact
finder
to
be
very
sure
that
the
child
has
committed
the
act
which
indicates
he
needs
rehabilitation,
that
he'd
be
very
certain
of
that,
will
change
the
court
in
it's
everyday
functioning
much
less
than
for
example
according
a
child
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
that
goes
much
closer
to
changing
the
posture
of
the
court
perhaps
not
in
new
york
but
elsewhere
than
a
simple
requirement
that
before
you
give
the
child
these
services,
and
there
is
some
debate
as
to
how
effective
they
are,
you
must
be
very
sure
that
he
really
needs
them,
that
he
has
committed
that
robbery
that
shows
that
he
needs
help.
in
new
york,
for
example,
if
i
may
explain
for
a
moment
the
hearing
is
bifurcated
one.
it's
a
two-stage
proceeding.
a
child
is
brought
to
the
fact
finding
hearing.
there,
he's
given
a
petition
which
has
the
charge
in
it
and
the
judge
hears
the
fact,
he
may
only
consider
competent,
relevant,
and
material
evidence.
no
social
history
is
permitted
of
the
judge
at
that
time
by
new
york
statute.
they
can
have
big
case
on
his
family's
problems
and
the
boy's
psychiatric
history
but
the
judge
may
not
see
it.
he
must
make
an
independent
determination
whether
the
boy
committed
this
act
or
not.
once
that
finding
of
guilt
is
made,
the
child
then
must
attend
what
is
known
as
a
dispositional
hearing.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
it
would
be
a
euphemism
to
call
it
anything
else
than
that.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
it's
called
a
fact
finding.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
well,
mr.
chief
justice
they
were
but
i
think
gault
quite
documented
the
fact
that
the
hopes
that
the
child
would
unequivocally
stand
to
benefit
from
these
procedures.
it
has
not
been
realized
and
i
don't
think
here
it
would
appropriate
to
go
into
a
reevaluation
of
how
successful
the
system
has
been
in
new
york.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
well,
i
would
like
to
say
in
that
respect
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
stressed
the
benefits
to
the
juvenile
of
these
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
it
has
made
that
evaluation
and
therefore
i
–-
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
a
sound
legislative
evaluation
that
that
the
–-
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
well,
i
think
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
amend
it.
we're
only
saying
that
within
the
legislative
structure,
the
elements
of
fair
play
prevail.
simply
that
i
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
that's
precisely
right,
mr.
justice
marshall.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
that's
right.
i
want,
we
want
as
it
has
been
suggested,
the
best
of
both
worlds.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
that's
right.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
that's
right.
i
think
a
word
should
be
said.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
pardon
me.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
it
was
a
judge
of
the
family
court,
judge
madonick
who's
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
judge
fuld,
judge
heaney
and
judge
burke,
i
believe.
i
would
like
to
just
make
one
note
about
the
alleged
benefits
that
the
court
of
appeals
stressed
in
its
opinion.
the
court
of
appeals
in
discussing
the
advantages
of
the
trial
of
this
so-called
secrecy
and
non-stigma
of
the
proceedings,
neglected
of
course
to
underscore
the
harsh
reality
that
when
a
child
is
found
guilty
in
this
court,
he
is
subjected
to
substantial
confinement
and
the
facilities
which
even
in
new
york
are
subject
to
a
great
deal
of
criticism.
now,
the
city
in
its
brief
has
a
compounded
this
omission
by
the
court
of
appeals
by
again
stressing
the
benefits
of
the
new
york
system
without
--
and
suggest
of
the
problems
with
the
institutions
have
never
been
shown
to
be
relevant
to
new
york
and
the
attorney
general
in
his
amicus
brief
doubly
compounds
this
by
actually
suggesting
that
this
is
summer
camp
and
that
children
just
can't
wait
to
go
to
the
training
school.
i
would
say
here
that
we
would
insist
that
the
standard
of
proof
be
high
even
if
these
were
model
institutions,
but
i
cannot
let
the
suggestion
of
the
attorney
general
go
un-contradicted
at
this
point.
a
recent
study
by
the
new
york
community
service
society,
one
of
the
oldest,
private
service
organizations
in
new
york,
has
issued
a
report
indicating
that
the
facilities
in
new
york
are
very
poor
indeed,
that
rehabilitation
and
counseling
range
from
token
to
nonexistent,
that
there
are
inadequate
provisions
not
only
for
vocational
training
but
for
even
ordinary
schooling.
that
there
are
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
i
only
--
i
only
raised
them
here
your
honor
because
it
has
been
suggested
by
my
adversary
that
all
theses
criticisms
that
would
make
it
question
of
fundamental
fairness
to
have
a
high
standards
of
proof
are
not
relevant
in
new
york
because
new
york's
institutions
are
so
marvelous
and
i
would
just
suggest
this
is
totally
contrary
to
the
fact
and
that
there
is
out
--
in
short,
there's
ample
a
basis
for
the
conclusion
of
the
community
service
society
that
the
children
in
these
institutions
validly
view
their
stay
there
as
doing
time.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes
they
do.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes
they
do
indeed.
i
would
say
roughly
half
or
not
quite
half
of
the
children
in
the,
i
believe,
in
these
institutions
are
there
as
persons
in
need
of
supervision.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
that's
right.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
and
no
judgment
they're
delinquent.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
neglected
children
are
sent
to
completely
separate
institutions
and
while
i'm
sure
there
is
again
always
room
for
improvement
in
these
facilities,
these
are
not
locked
shelters.
and
a
--
finding
that
a
child
has
committed
a
violation
of
law
also
subjects
him
to
a
temporary
detention.
there
is
--
there
are
statistics
to
the
effect
that
some
35%
of
the
children
who
are
found
guilty
of
law
violations
spend
some
time
in
the
temporary
detention
facility
and
of
those
some
40%
i
believe
are
there
beyond
30
days.
now,
it
takes
just
one
visit
to
that
detention
facility
in
new
york
to
convince
one
that
we're
not
talking
about
an
open,
free
shelter
for
little
children.
it
is
a
facility
where
you
cannot
walk
30
feet
but
that
the
custodian
doesn't
have
to
unlock
the
doors
to
let
you
go
through
the
corridors
and
children
are
locked
into
their
rooms
at
night.
now,
there
are
various
branches.
there
are
some
facilities
that
are
somewhat
more
open
for
the
younger
children,
but
the
essential
facility
in
bronx
county
is
the
kind
that
i
described
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
i
would,
i
would
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
would
say
that
we
want
without
arguing
about
although
i
have
been
arguing
about
the
inadequacy
of
the
facilities
but
even
assuming
they
were
a
model
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
well,
it
helps
it
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes
[attempt
to
laughter].
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes.
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
i'm
only
trying
to
somewhat
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes.
yes
it
is.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
that's
right.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
nothing
would
prohibit
it.
i
would
think
we're
determining
what
is
concept
of
a
fair
trial.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes
you
do,
i
would
say.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes
i
am.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
well,
there's
a
fact
finding
and
then
he
goes
to
disposition
at
this
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
i
would
say
that
even
if
there
is,
even
if
it
is
assumed
after
dispositional
hearing
that
he
does
not
require
the
supervision
of
the
court
and
he's
dismissed
therefore,
there
is
still
a
finding
of
guilt
against
him
and
that
finding
of
guilt
carries
with
it
the
same
stigma
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
well,
it
is
expressed
that
he
has
been
found
guilty
of
a
certain
criminal
act
or
an
act,
which
would
be
a
crime.
however,
we
do
not
adjudicate
him
a
delinquent
because
he
has
not
demonstrated
that
he
needs
confinement
or
supervision.
however,
the
effect
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
no,
he
might
not
--
it's
like
a
suspended
judgment.
i
would
suggest
it's
very
much
like
a
--
like
a
suspended
sentence.
the
child
is
determined
to
have
committed
act
but
it
is
dismissed,
so-called
because
he
does
not
require
probation
say.
however,
in
future
years,
when
these
records
become
pertinent
in
his
life,
as
in
the
military,
all
schools
have
a
record
of
these
proceedings,
they
will
check
and
they
will
know
--
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes,
i
would
say
so
and
i
would
say
your
honor,
it
is
a
very,
analogous
to
the
specht
v.
patterson
kind
of
cases
where
the
court
is
required
to
hold
a
separate
hearing
to
determine
whether
the
individual
will
have
a
certain
special
kind
of
sentence
imposed
upon
him,
but
this
does
not
reduce
the
state's
burden
to
provide
the
--
to
prove
the
underlying
law
violation
by
a
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
the
suggestion
by
the
city
that
this
two-stage
proceeding
somehow
relieves
the
state
of
proving
the
underlying
act
by
the
highest
standard
of
proof
is
really
essentially
an
unsound
one.
in
sum,
we're
merely
suggesting
that
let
the
state
services
whether
they're
good
or
bad
be
reserved
for
children
against
to
whom
it's
been
demonstrated
really
require
them
by
having
prove
the
acts,
requires
such
rehabilitation.
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
thank
you.

probable
jurisdiction
but
seven
months
after,
the
notice
of
appeal
was
filed
to
this
court
and
as
far
as
the
mootness
question
is
concerned
in
dealing
with
sibron
criteria,
i
would
say
that
the
military
does
know
about
these
things.
it
does
have
an
effect.
one
need
only
go
into
family
court.
i've
seen
the
stack
of
requisitions
from
the
military
which
have
requested
information
because
the
child
is
asked
to
disclose
it
or
otherwise
he
doesn't
qualify.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
it's
not
a
violation
because
the
law
only
says,
the
court,
the
record
shall
not
be
open
to
indiscriminate
public
review,
but
the
court
in
its
discretion
may
reveal
it
to
anybody
and
it
is
done
both
in
civil
service
and
in
the
military
situation.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes,
but
i
would
say
that
the
stigma
is
still
bring
it
within
the
sibron
criteria.
ms.
rena
k.
uviller
yes,
thank
you.
