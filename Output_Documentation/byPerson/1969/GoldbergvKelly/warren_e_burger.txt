mr.
loflin,
i
suppose
up
in
mariposa
county
where
they
have
a
few
recipients
and
few
staff
members,
it
would
be
possible
that
the
man
who
made
the
decision
to
grant
the
benefit
in
the
first
place
might
be
the
same
man
who
listened
to
the
recipient
in
this
process
you're
describing.

if
you
have
any
such
a
community.
is
it
possible
then
that
the
man
who
granted
the
relief
might
be
the

was
considering

wouldn't
you

some
ambiguity
on

so
as
not
to

chief

warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
he
knows
that
his

are
being

questioned

he
has
already
waited
to
find
out
what
they
have
in
mind
by
these
symbols?
chief

warren
e.
burger
well,
was
his
restoration
retroactive?

his
