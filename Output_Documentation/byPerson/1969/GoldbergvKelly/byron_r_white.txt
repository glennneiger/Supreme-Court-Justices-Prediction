justice

white
2

justice
byron

white
does
that
fall
in
your
brief,
pages
2
to
5?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
date
april
26,
1968?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
new
york's
procedure
satisfies
the
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
the
new
york
statute
goes
as
far
as,
according
to
the
due
process,
before
the
termination
as
the
solicitor
general's
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
there
that
new
york
statute
requires
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
what
paragraph?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
are
those
the
ones
that
you
are
trying
to
contest
upon?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
my
question,
are
those
the
ones
that
we
have
to
decide
on
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
the
change
in
the
new
york
situation
doesn't
change
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
some
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
which
ones
are
we
going
to
be
arguing
about,
all
of
them
or
just
some
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
it's
not
an
issue
between
the
parties?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
a
part
of
preposition
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
you
going
to
think
in
response
to
this,
don't
you
think
in
responding
to
mr.
justice
black's
question,
we
have
to
really
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
closest
case
in
this
court
for
that
preposition?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
fleming
and
nestor,
is
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
that
the
content
of
the
hearing
you
urge
goes
beyond
what
the
federal
government
thinks
is
warranted.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
though
that
--
you
would
also
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
also
go
beyond
what
the
district
court
said
was
required
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
what
if
the
--
what
if
there's
a
conflict
on
the
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
on
part,
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
think
the
district
court
would
go
that
far
in
all
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
it's
critical
to
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
situation
where
there
are
no
factual
--
or
just
a
questioning
of
the
law
or
a
question
of
the
(voice
overlap)
or
something
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
if
a
--
if
you've
got
the
kind
of
a
hearing
prior
to
termination,
prior
to
the
termination
that
you
want,
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
matter
as
far
as
the
--
that
state's
due
process.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
say
that
if
you
prevail
a
fortiori,
the
same
would
apply
to
city
employees?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
i
asked
you
about
the
ordinary
case
where
the
ordinary
employee
know
unusual
circumstances
except
someone
just
wants
to
fire
you.
would
you
say
there
is
some
due
process
requirements
before
stopping
the
salary
or
the
wage?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
prevail
that
would
be
more
likely
that
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
situation
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
until
the
regulation
(voice
overlap)
effective,
what's
the
situation
as
far
as
federal
matching
money
is
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

the
choice,
the
state
can
do
it
either
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
up
to
the
case
hearing?
justice
byron

is
that
the
