mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
unlike
the
california
case
you
just
have
described,
there
were
two
separate
statutory
forms
of
benefits
involved.
the
federal
benefits
which
are
substantially
the
same
as
those
in
the
california
case
and
what
in
new
york
is
known
as
home
relief.
the
presence
of
the
home
relief
recipients
as
plaintiffs
in
the
cases
that
are
here
consolidated
accounted
for
at
least
in
part
the
decision
of
the
court
below
to
reach
constitutional
issues
rather
than
leave
the
decision
to
rest
upon
a
statutory
basis.
they
reasoned
that
even
if
they
could
resolve
the
case
as
to
the
federal
beneficiaries,
they
would
still
have
to
face
the
problem
of
what
to
do
about
the
state
recipients.
so
without
pausing
on
that
question,
they
went
into
the
constitutional
area.
these
three
cases
here
consolidated
as
per
substantially
identical
relief,
that
is,
as
it
went
to
the
three-judge
court
below,
plaintiffs
were
asking
for
a
preliminary
injunction
requiring
defendants
to
cease
terminations
without
having
a
prior
hearing
which
according
to
plaintiff's
judgment
would
meet
the
standards
of
due
process
of
law.
in
addition,
they
wanted
a
declaratory
judgment.
as
we
got
to
the
three
judge
hearing
stage,
the
declaratory
judgment
section
of
their
relief
focused
upon
a
new
new
york
state
regulation
which
was
in
fact
promulgated
after
the
first
of
these
cases
was
filed.
i
would
like
to
dwell
for
a
moment
on
the
sequence
of
events
because
it
did
have
some
influence
i
believe
on
the
decisions
below.
at
the
time
the
first
of
these
cases
was
filed
in
new
york,
there
was
no
pre-termination
conference
hearing
procedure.
it
was
entirely
possible
and
frequently
happened
that
a
beneficiary
would
simply
receive
a
notice
in
saying
your
benefits
have
been
cutoff,
refer
to
your
handbook
or
your
pamphlet
as
to
any
rights
you
might
have
to
have
a
fair
hearing.
this
led
to
unfortunate
circumstances,
unfortunate
damage
to
a
number
of
recipients
and
led
directly
to
the
filing
of
a
lawsuit.
shortly
after
the
suit
was
filed,
new
york
state
followed
california
in
adopting
a
pre-termination
regulation.
now
this
is
a
regulation
which
is
here
before
this
court,
number
351.26.
as
you
may
know
in
the
state
of
new
york,
well
over
half
of
the
total
welfare
recipients
reside
in
the
city
of
new
york.
the
state
however
promulgated
this
new
regulation
without
consultation
with
the
city;
it
reached
the
city
officials
in
late
february
and
was
to
become
effective
by
its
terms
on
march
1.
the
state
however
did
not
provide
hearing
officers
or
training
or
any
real
guidelines
much
less
any
financing
so
that
this
machinery
could
be
setup
on
what
was
at
the
time
two
or
three
days
notice.
the
city
reacted
to
this
by
asking
for
conferences
with
the
state
officials
to
see
if
the
impact
of
this
new
procedure
on
the
city
administration
could
be
less.
in
fact,
after
a
series
of
conferences
at
which
the
difficulties
of
enforcing
the
new
state
regulation
in
a
city
with
approximately
1
million
people
on
welfare
was
pointed
out.
the
state
resented
its
original
regulation
and
then
at
the
same
time
put
out
the
regulation
which
is
now
before
this
court.
it
consists
of
two
parts,
351.26
(a)
and
351.26
(b).
a
welfare
district
which
new
york
city
is
one
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
well,
in
the
record
its
set
forth
at
127
(a).
and
that's
the
regulation
as
finally
adopted.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes
sir.
351.26
(a)
and
(b).
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
they
are
quoted
in
several
different
places,
that's
one.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
correct.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes
sir.
now,
both
of
these
subparagraphs
that
is
(a)
and
(b)
were
challenged
by
the
plaintiffs
below.
the
court
examined
both
of
them,
held
in
fact
that
subparagraph
(b)
which
had
been
adopted
in
new
york
city
was
unconstitutional
as
not
affording
proper
due
process
of
law
and
in
particular,
the
deficits
that
they
pointed
out
were
the
lack
of
confrontation
and
cross
examination.
the
three-judge
court
in
the
southern
district
saw
no
room
for
that
in
the
procedure
before
it
under
subparagraph
(b)
and
held
that
those
were
essential
elements
which
must
be
present.
and
since
there
was
some
ambiguity
as
to
subparagraph
(a),
they
construed
subparagraph
(a)
to
require
confrontation
and
cross
examination
of
adverse
witnesses
and
said
in
effect,
“if
you
don't
operate
it
in
that
fashion,
that
section
too
would
be
unconstitutional
and
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law.”
the
state
did
not
appeal
in
this
case.
the
city
with
an
interest
in
subparagraph
(b)
is
here
before
the
court.
it
is
vital
to
our
case
for
the
court
to
understand
that
we
do
not
rest
alone
on
subparagraph
(b)
of
351.26.
it
is
the
pattern
or
regulation
in
the
state
of
new
york
for
a
city
welfare
district
particularly,
one
of
the
size
of
the
city
in
new
york
to
adopt
its
own
implementing
regulations
subject
to
state
approval.
that
was
done
in
this
case.
our
local
regulation
is
known
as
procedure
68-18.
now
that
is
set
forth
in
the
record
following
pages
147
and
148.
i
stress
the
importance
of
our
local
procedure
because
i
think
the
court
needs
to
have
the
full
process
before
you
and
understand
particularly
how
the
client
first
becomes
involved
in
these
procedural
steps.
under
our
local
procedure,
the
caseworker
is
obliged
to
notify
the
client
when
information
comes
to
him
indicating
there
is
a
question
as
a
continued
eligibility
to
receive
benefits.
the
caseworker
has
the
duty
of
calling
the
client
in
and
discussing
these
matters
with
them
in
a
face
to
face
conference.
the
client
is
in
a
position
then
to
discover
what
it
is
that
has
led
the
city
to
believe
that
this
person
is
no
longer
eligible.
that
client
is
in
a
position
to
tell
the
city
why
it
is
making
a
mistake
if
it
is
and
to
correct
error
if
error
there
be.
in
the
event,
the
caseworker
determines
after
a
conference
with
the
client
that
there
is
probable
reason
to
conclude
that
the
client
is
in
fact
no
longer
eligible,
the
case
file
in
the
caseworker's
recommendation
go
to
the
unit
supervisor
where
the
entire
matter
is
subject
to
review.
it
is
only
if
the
unit
supervisor
concurs
in
the
judgment
of
the
caseworker,
does
the
formal
notice
contemplated
by
351.26
(b)
issues
--
that
notice
tells
the
recipient
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
your
honor
i
believe
that
the
due
process
as
i
see
it
begins
at
the
point
where
the
client
is
called
in
for
the
conference
with
the
caseworker.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
that's
where
the
process
begins
your
honor.
if
it
stop
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
under
these
facts,
i
believe
that
it
is,
yes.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
have
accepted
the
fact
that
a
welfare
recipient
faced
with
termination
is
entitled
to
due
process
appropriate
to
the
circumstances.
this
to
me
does
not
necessarily
mean
the
type
of
due
process
that
would
be
appropriate
under
circumstances
of
criminal
law
or
civil
case
law
or
any
number
of
other
factual
patterns.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
there
are
many
facets
which
are
peculiar
to
welfare.
there
is
no
other
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
as
was
adverted
to
earlier
this
morning,
it
bears
some
resemblance
to
the
cases
where
public
employees
have
been
called
up
on
charges
and
suspended
but
later
given
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
there
is
a
situation
where
monetary
benefits
of
one
sort
or
another
or
ultimately
cutoff
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
well,
obviously
the
impact
on
the
individual
is
much
worse
if
we
make
an
error
in
the
case
of
someone
who
is
destitute
than
if
we
make
an
error
in
the
case
of
someone
who
is
well
off.
i
don't
doubt
that.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
definitely
would
be
inclined
and
my
position
is
that
this
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
don't
accept
the
hypothesis
sir
that
the
caseworker
has
a
closed
mind
at
the
time
he
advised
the
client
to
come
in.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
it
may
be
the
caseworker,
information
may
come
from
other
sources.
information
comes
to
the
welfare
department
from
many
sources.
it
may
come
from
a
bank,
from
a
landlady,
from
a
friend
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
that's
the
reason
he
is
called
in.
the
caseworker
has
some
information
which
he
wants
clarified.
he
gets
hold
of
information
which
is
of
sufficient
weight
that
he
says,
“i
need
a
personal
conference
with
this
person
to
hear
their
side
of
the
story
and
maybe
he
can
explain
this
away.”
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
your
honor
i
contend
that
it
is
part
of
a
procedure
which
when
taken
in
its
entirety
constitutes
such
basic
fairness
that
it
is
due
process
of
law.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
taken
altogether,
it
is
my
idea
of
fairness
but
not
truncating
it
and
chopping
it
off
at
one
little
chapter
and
saying,
“well,
this
is
all
the
due
process
the
person
is
going
to
get.”
that's
not
my
position.
but
that's
not
the
end
of
the
process.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
we've
had
the
meeting
with
the
caseworker.
we've
had
the
review
by
the
unit
supervisor.
we've
had
the
notice
go
out
to
the
client
that
gives
him
seven
days
to
come
in
with
any
written
information
with
the
aid
of
counsel
he'd
like
to
present.
that
is
then
reviewed
by
still
a
third
level
of
officials
who
has
no
personal
involvement
in
the
decision
at
the
caseworker
level.
this
supervisory
person
gets
the
record
and
anything
submitted
by
the
client,
reviews
the
entire
matter
and
its
only
after
he
is
satisfied
that
the
person
is
ineligible
that
the
benefits
are
cutoff.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
think
that
meets
due
process,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
new
york
regulation
prevents
those
decisions
being
all
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
have
to
admit
i'm
not
as
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
--
with
mariposa
county
as
might
be.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
believe
that
would
not
comply
with
the
state
regulation
in
new
york
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
under
the
new
regulation,
that's
right,
whether
it
could
happen,
i
can't
tell
you.
it
is
not
administratively
set
up
that
way
in
the
city
of
new
york
where
of
course
we
do
have
the
highest
the
volume
in
the
country.
so,
we
have
gone
through
these
three
layers
of
administrative
review
before
any
action
adverse
to
the
welfare
recipient
is
taken.
if
the
decision
ultimately
after
the
review
officer
has
gone
over
the
entire
matter
and
reached
the
conclusion,
if
he
decides
that
benefits
are
to
be
terminated,
a
notice
to
that
effect
is
sent
to
the
client
and
a
notice
also
includes
a
clear
statement
to
the
effect
that
the
decision
may
be
reviewed
in
a
fair
hearing.
and
what
i
suggested
to
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
entire
process
has
to
be
looked
on
in
order
to
see
whether
or
not
due
process
has
been
observed,
i
think
it
starts
with
the
initial
conference
with
the
caseworker
and
does
not
conclude
until
after
the
fair
hearing.
now
true
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes
sir,
under
article
78
of
the
new
york
civil
practice
law
and
rules,
any
decision
of
a
hearing
officer
that
results
in
a
denial
of
benefits,
the
person
whose
benefits
denied
is
considered
an
aggrieved
person
and
he
may
sue
the
state
hearing
officer
and
have
it
--
the
entire
package,
the
record
of
the
case
reviewed
by
a
state
supreme
court
justice.
so,
we
do
have
this
gap
that
can
occur
and
mr.
justice
marshall
is
entirely
right
and
there's
no
denying
that
a
person
who
is
in
fact
destitute
can
be
heard
between
the
period
when
the
review
officer
cuts
off
the
benefits
and
the
time
when
in
fact
we
are
wrong,
the
state's
fair
hearing
officer
restores
those
benefits.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
well,
there
is
evidence
in
the
case
that
it
varies
tremendously.
new
york
had
fallen
behind
beginning
about
in
1967.
i
might
point
out
in
the
first
half
of
1967,
fair
hearings
were
running
at
the
rate
of
200
or
300
per
month.
in
the
last
half
of
1967,
they
jumped
to
as
high
as
eleven
hundred
per
month.
now,
this
problem
has
been
alleviated
somewhat
the
total
number
of
hearing
officers
has
been
increased
by
50%.
we
had
only
8
for
the
state.
at
the
beginning
of
this
period
we
now
have
12
and
additional
staff
has
been
provided
so
as
mrs.
palmer
advised
the
court,
california
has
responded
to
the
increased
case
loads
so
as
new
york.
i
can't
tell
you
that
we
have
completely
caught
up
on
our
backlog,
we
haven't
but
we're
making
deep
inroads
into
it
and
we
hope
to
bring
the
state
of
new
york
into
compliance
with
the
time
table
that
the
federal
government
has
proposed.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes
sir.
now
i
would
point
out
to
you
that
in
this
case
in
addition
to
the
constitutional
issues
which
drew
the
focus
of
attention
in
the
court
below,
there
is
a
statutory
regulatory
scheme
which
provides
a
framework
with
when
--
within
which
the
case
could
also
be
examined.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
will
rest
on
either
your
honor.
i
claim
that
we
have
granted
due
process
if
it's
to
be
measured
by
constitutional
standards.
i
also
claim
here
and
i
believe
that
the
record
will
show
we
are
in
compliance
with
the
hew
regulations
on
this
subject.
hereto,
this
was
a
development
during
the
course
of
this
case;
the
regulation
to
which
i
refer
became
effective
july
1,
1968
well
after
this
cases
had
started.
but
the
regulation
is
set
forth
in
part
on
page
12
of
solicitor
general's
brief
and
it's
very
brief
if
i
may
refer
to
it,
its
cited
to
the
hew
handbook,
section
2300
(d)
(5)
and
it
states
that
advanced
notice
of
questions,
it
has
about
an
individual's
eligibility
so
that
a
recipient
has
an
opportunity
to
discuss
the
situation
before
receiving
formal
written
notice
of
reduction
in
payment
or
termination
of
assistance
is
required.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes.
we
have
not
denied
that.
i
just
point
this
regulatory
framework
out
to
afford
another
basis
for
the
court's
examination
if
you
wish.
the
court
below
turned
away
from
that
entirely
and
went
to
the
constitutional
issue.
but
we
do
not
here
claim
that
a
welfare
beneficiary
whose
benefits
are
about
to
be
terminated
is
not
entitled
to
some
pre-termination
procedures
--
constitutionally
entitled
to
some
pre-termination
procedure.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
do
sir.
you
will
note
that
the
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
believe
it
goes
as
far
as
the
solicitor
general's
brief
says
is
required.
i
would
point
out
to
you
that
annex
to
the
reply
brief
filed
by
my
opponent
is
another
brief
filed
in
the
court
below
in
which
the
federal
government
took
the
position
explicitly
that
both
subparagraph
(a)
of
the
regulation
and
(b)
complied
with
the
federal
regulation.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
that
comes
up
under
our
procedure
68-18,
the
local
procedure
adopted
to
implement
the
state
regulation.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
under
paragraph
(b).
and
that
procedure
had
to
obtain
state's
approval.
in
other
words
we
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
procedure
68-18
appears
in
the
record
following
pages
147,
148a.
it's
annex
to
an
affidavit
of
the
appellate
here,
the
commissioner
of
social
welfare,
jack
goldberg.
i
consider
those
procedures
adopted
through
the
local
regulation
as
complimentary
to
the
state
regulation.
we
couldn't
have
implemented
the
state
regulation
without
adopting
local
procedures
and
i
believe
that
we
are
properly
entitled
to
be
judged
by
what
we
actually
did,
not
by
theoretically
what
we
might
have
done
and
these
procedures
of
course
were
before
the
court
below.
they
were
not
adopted
after
the
decisions
at
that
time.
the
regulation
by
the
state
came
out
in
the
spring
of
1968,
the
revised
regulation.
it
took
--
i
would
say
roughly
close
to
a
month
before
the
regulation
became
effective
in
new
york
city.
during
part
of
that
month,
the
review
officers
had
to
be
selected
and
guidelines
had
to
be
developed.
in
addition,
the
procedure
that
the
city
of
new
york
intended
to
follow
had
to
be
submitted
to
the
state
for
its
approval.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes
sir.
it
is
the
city's
procedure
which
imposes
first
of
all
the
duty
on
the
case
worker
to
call
the
client
in
for
a
conference
and
explain
to
him
the
reasons
why
his
benefits
may
be
terminated.
i
stress
the
fact,
maybe
terminated
nothing
has
happen
at
this
point.
the
client
has
called
in
and
told
that
we
have
certain
information
which
leads
us
to
believe
that
you
may
no
longer
be
eligible.
the
client
of
course
has
an
opportunity
to
rebut,
to
explain
or
to
say
anything
he
had
liked
in
response
to
this
information.
following
that
conference
which
is
summarized
in
some
detail
by
the
caseworker,
all
of
the
information
concerning
this
matter
is
referred
to
the
unit
supervisor.
this
is
a
man
next
up
the
ladder
above
the
caseworker.
the
unit
supervisor
reviews
the
whole
matter
and
that
it
is
only
--
if
only
concurs
that
the
notice
contemplated
by
this
paragraph
be
goes
out,
still
no
benefits
have
been
terminated.
the
client
receives
a
notice
saying
that
your
benefits
may
be
terminated
within
seven
days,
unless
you
request
a
review.
the
reasons
for
the
proposed
termination
are
as
follows
and
then
the
reasons
are
explained
and
it
further
goes
on
to
say
that
if
you
which
to
have
a
review,
you
may
submit
anything
you
would
like
for
review
by
a
review
officer
and
you
may
have
the
assistance
of
counsel
in
submitting
anything
that
you
would
like.
now,
this
submission
does
not
constitute
a
hearing
in
the
classic
sense
in
our
confrontation
with
witnesses.
but
it
is
the
continuation
of
the
process
that
began
with
a
face
to
face
meeting
between
the
caseworker
and
the
client
and
it
does
bring
in
to
play
another
and
a
higher
official
who
has
no
stake
in
the
decision
reached
by
those
subordinate
officials
below.
and
it
is
only
after
his
review
that
any
impact
in
any
monetary
sense
is
felt
by
the
client.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
there
is
state
law
provisions
for
fair
hearings
but
it
--
the
reason
that
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes
sir
it
does.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
well,
the
fair
hearing
requirement
originates
in
federal
law
and
any
state
plans
submitted
to
the
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes
sir,
there
is.
i
can't
cite
it
to
you
off
hand
but
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
alright,
that's
easier
for
me.
a
state
fair
hearing
is
a
hearing
in
the
traditional
sense.
by
that
i
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
there
is
a
state
hearing
officer
first
of
all,
not
a
city
official.
these
original
decisions
that
i'm
talking
about
to
terminate
are
at
the
city
level.
the
hearing
officer
on
a
state
fair
hearing
is
a
state
official.
evidence
is
introduced
although
it
is
administrative
rules
of
evidence
that
apply
and
by
that
i
mean
it
is
possible
that
some
hearsay
may
be
introduced
as
is
true
in
most
administrative
proceedings.
the
client
whose
benefits
may
be
terminated
or
restored
has
a
right
to
examine
before
the
hearing
any
evidence
that
the
state
or
the
city
intends
to
introduce
against
him.
in
other
words,
if
there
are
written
documents
involved,
they
must
be
displayed
to
the
recipient
or
his
counsel
in
advance
of
the
hearing.
witnesses
are
examined
and
a
verbatim
transcript
is
made
of
the
proceedings
and
a
writ
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
the
regulations
require
that
sir.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
and
finally
a
written
decision
comes
down.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
will
give
it
to
you
subsequently.
i
don't
have
it
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
have
reserved
one
or
two
minutes
for
rebuttal
and
when
i
rebut,
i
will
give
you
the
precise
citation
to
the
statute
and
to
the
regulations
that
give
you
the
details.
they
are
substantially
as
i
have
outlined
them
to
your
honor
and
i
will
reserve
that
opportunity
if
i
may
for
that
time.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
if
the
court
please.
i
ask
--
particularly
believe
that
mr.
justice
black
to
check
the
citation.
you
had
asked
me
sir
where
we
could
find
the
regulations
that
would
describe
the
rights
afforded,
those
who
appear
in
a
state
fair
hearing.
it
is
in
our
record,
following
page
160.
and
i
particularly
refer
to
you
--
to
section
84
of
the
state
regulations
and
more
particularly
beginning
on
page
2,
it
describes
the
entire
procedure
from
the
time
a
request
was
made.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
it
follows
page
160
of
the
record.
immediately
following
that
page
is
a
resolution
of
the
state
board
of
social
welfare
which
goes
for
two
pages
and
then
begins
regulation
number
84.2
and
that
entire
regulation
deals
with
the
procedure
under
the
state
fair
hearings.
and
you
will
find
among
other
things,
there
is
a
notice
of
the
hearing
which
gives
all
the
details,
you
would
need
to
note
to
go
the
proper
place
and
tell
you
who
you're
going
to
appear
before
and
advice
you
of
the
right
of
each
party
to
be
represented
to
testify,
produce
witnesses,
to
present
documentary
evidence
and
to
examine
opposing
witnesses
and
evidence.
84.9
gives
you
the
right
to
examine
the
other
sides
evidence
in
advance
of
the
hearing.
it
points
out
that
the
hearing
is
to
be
conducted
by
any
impartial
hearing
officer.
it
goes
on
to
detail
the
burden
of
the
hearing
officer
to
render
a
written
opinion,
what
the
content
shall
be
that
the
decision
must
be
sent
to
the
client
and
that
he
be
advised
upon
recede
of
the
decision
of
his
right
to
judicial
review
under
new
york
law.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
well,
under
federal
regulations,
they're
supposed
to
take
place
and
be
completed
within
60
days.
this
is
the
60
day
period
that
has
been
referred
to
previously
in
the
discussion
this
morning.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
now.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
don't
of
any.
the
pattern
would
not
be
much
different
under
the
home
relief
cases
under
any
of
the
others.
now
i
would
refer
if
i
may
to
the
section
of
my
main
brief
on
pages
14
and
15.
our
procedures
have
been
sharply
criticized
here
and
it
has
been
pointed
out
by
my
adversary
that
under
paragraph
(a)
which
is
his
preferred
procedure,
a
number
of
reversals
of
caseworker
decisions
have
occurred.
we
had
a
brief
period,
just
a
few
months
roughly
from
june
to
november
of
1968
during
which
the
city
of
new
york
operated
under
the
provisions
subparagraph
(b)
in
its
local
procedure,
6818.
during
that
period,
approximately
44%
of
the
decisions
to
terminate
were
reversed
as
a
result
of
our
own
procedures.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
our
procedures
were
working
and
during
that
same
period
of
time,
as
is
true
now,
some
of
our
cases
then
went
on
to
the
fair
hearing
stage.
during
those
same
months,
the
reversals
on
termination
cases
after
fair
hearings
did
not
exceed
three
cases
per
month
and
in
one
month,
september
1968,
there
were
no
reversals.
i
think
this
is
a
demonstration
that
goes
beyond
the
face
of
the
regulations
itself
that
the
procedure
is
designed
to
be
fair.
it
is
designed
to
weed
out
error
and
it
works.
this
court
has
on
other
occasions
and
in
other
contexts
molded
constitutional
requirements
appropriate
to
the
facts.
due
process
has
been
described
as
a
flexible,
not
a
fixed
concept.
it
might
also
be
noted
that
under
the
fourth
amendment,
in
the
kamara
and
see
cases
where
there
was
a
question
of
the
burden
of
proof
on
a
locality
before
a
warrant
should
be
issued.
it
was
found
by
this
court
that
the
burden
of
proof
need
not
be
quite
as
high
as
in
a
traditional
criminal
warrant
search
and
seizure.
there
is
room
for
innovation
at
the
local
level,
in
state
and
local
governments
and
i
feel
that
our
innovation
meets
the
standards
that
this
court
has
indicated
or
required
for
due
process.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
unlike
the
california
case
you
just
have
described,
there
were
two
separate
statutory
forms
of
benefits
involved.
the
federal
benefits
which
are
substantially
the
same
as
those
in
the
california
case
and
what
in
new
york
is
known
as
home
relief.
the
presence
of
the
home
relief
recipients
as
plaintiffs
in
the
cases
that
are
here
consolidated
accounted
for
at
least
in
part
the
decision
of
the
court
below
to
reach
constitutional
issues
rather
than
leave
the
decision
to
rest
upon
a
statutory
basis.
they
reasoned
that
even
if
they
could
resolve
the
case
as
to
the
federal
beneficiaries,
they
would
still
have
to
face
the
problem
of
what
to
do
about
the
state
recipients.
so
without
pausing
on
that
question,
they
went
into
the
constitutional
area.
these
three
cases
here
consolidated
as
per
substantially
identical
relief,
that
is,
as
it
went
to
the
three-judge
court
below,
plaintiffs
were
asking
for
a
preliminary
injunction
requiring
defendants
to
cease
terminations
without
having
a
prior
hearing
which
according
to
plaintiff's
judgment
would
meet
the
standards
of
due
process
of
law.
in
addition,
they
wanted
a
declaratory
judgment.
as
we
got
to
the
three
judge
hearing
stage,
the
declaratory
judgment
section
of
their
relief
focused
upon
a
new
new
york
state
regulation
which
was
in
fact
promulgated
after
the
first
of
these
cases
was
filed.
i
would
like
to
dwell
for
a
moment
on
the
sequence
of
events
because
it
did
have
some
influence
i
believe
on
the
decisions
below.
at
the
time
the
first
of
these
cases
was
filed
in
new
york,
there
was
no
pre-termination
conference
hearing
procedure.
it
was
entirely
possible
and
frequently
happened
that
a
beneficiary
would
simply
receive
a
notice
in
saying
your
benefits
have
been
cutoff,
refer
to
your
handbook
or
your
pamphlet
as
to
any
rights
you
might
have
to
have
a
fair
hearing.
this
led
to
unfortunate
circumstances,
unfortunate
damage
to
a
number
of
recipients
and
led
directly
to
the
filing
of
a
lawsuit.
shortly
after
the
suit
was
filed,
new
york
state
followed
california
in
adopting
a
pre-termination
regulation.
now
this
is
a
regulation
which
is
here
before
this
court,
number
351.26.
as
you
may
know
in
the
state
of
new
york,
well
over
half
of
the
total
welfare
recipients
reside
in
the
city
of
new
york.
the
state
however
promulgated
this
new
regulation
without
consultation
with
the
city;
it
reached
the
city
officials
in
late
february
and
was
to
become
effective
by
its
terms
on
march
1.
the
state
however
did
not
provide
hearing
officers
or
training
or
any
real
guidelines
much
less
any
financing
so
that
this
machinery
could
be
setup
on
what
was
at
the
time
two
or
three
days
notice.
the
city
reacted
to
this
by
asking
for
conferences
with
the
state
officials
to
see
if
the
impact
of
this
new
procedure
on
the
city
administration
could
be
less.
in
fact,
after
a
series
of
conferences
at
which
the
difficulties
of
enforcing
the
new
state
regulation
in
a
city
with
approximately
1
million
people
on
welfare
was
pointed
out.
the
state
resented
its
original
regulation
and
then
at
the
same
time
put
out
the
regulation
which
is
now
before
this
court.
it
consists
of
two
parts,
351.26
(a)
and
351.26
(b).
a
welfare
district
which
new
york
city
is
one
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
well,
in
the
record
its
set
forth
at
127
(a).
and
that's
the
regulation
as
finally
adopted.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes
sir.
351.26
(a)
and
(b).
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
they
are
quoted
in
several
different
places,
that's
one.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
correct.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes
sir.
now,
both
of
these
subparagraphs
that
is
(a)
and
(b)
were
challenged
by
the
plaintiffs
below.
the
court
examined
both
of
them,
held
in
fact
that
subparagraph
(b)
which
had
been
adopted
in
new
york
city
was
unconstitutional
as
not
affording
proper
due
process
of
law
and
in
particular,
the
deficits
that
they
pointed
out
were
the
lack
of
confrontation
and
cross
examination.
the
three-judge
court
in
the
southern
district
saw
no
room
for
that
in
the
procedure
before
it
under
subparagraph
(b)
and
held
that
those
were
essential
elements
which
must
be
present.
and
since
there
was
some
ambiguity
as
to
subparagraph
(a),
they
construed
subparagraph
(a)
to
require
confrontation
and
cross
examination
of
adverse
witnesses
and
said
in
effect,
“if
you
don't
operate
it
in
that
fashion,
that
section
too
would
be
unconstitutional
and
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law.”
the
state
did
not
appeal
in
this
case.
the
city
with
an
interest
in
subparagraph
(b)
is
here
before
the
court.
it
is
vital
to
our
case
for
the
court
to
understand
that
we
do
not
rest
alone
on
subparagraph
(b)
of
351.26.
it
is
the
pattern
or
regulation
in
the
state
of
new
york
for
a
city
welfare
district
particularly,
one
of
the
size
of
the
city
in
new
york
to
adopt
its
own
implementing
regulations
subject
to
state
approval.
that
was
done
in
this
case.
our
local
regulation
is
known
as
procedure
68-18.
now
that
is
set
forth
in
the
record
following
pages
147
and
148.
i
stress
the
importance
of
our
local
procedure
because
i
think
the
court
needs
to
have
the
full
process
before
you
and
understand
particularly
how
the
client
first
becomes
involved
in
these
procedural
steps.
under
our
local
procedure,
the
caseworker
is
obliged
to
notify
the
client
when
information
comes
to
him
indicating
there
is
a
question
as
a
continued
eligibility
to
receive
benefits.
the
caseworker
has
the
duty
of
calling
the
client
in
and
discussing
these
matters
with
them
in
a
face
to
face
conference.
the
client
is
in
a
position
then
to
discover
what
it
is
that
has
led
the
city
to
believe
that
this
person
is
no
longer
eligible.
that
client
is
in
a
position
to
tell
the
city
why
it
is
making
a
mistake
if
it
is
and
to
correct
error
if
error
there
be.
in
the
event,
the
caseworker
determines
after
a
conference
with
the
client
that
there
is
probable
reason
to
conclude
that
the
client
is
in
fact
no
longer
eligible,
the
case
file
in
the
caseworker's
recommendation
go
to
the
unit
supervisor
where
the
entire
matter
is
subject
to
review.
it
is
only
if
the
unit
supervisor
concurs
in
the
judgment
of
the
caseworker,
does
the
formal
notice
contemplated
by
351.26
(b)
issues
--
that
notice
tells
the
recipient
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
your
honor
i
believe
that
the
due
process
as
i
see
it
begins
at
the
point
where
the
client
is
called
in
for
the
conference
with
the
caseworker.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
that's
where
the
process
begins
your
honor.
if
it
stop
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
under
these
facts,
i
believe
that
it
is,
yes.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
have
accepted
the
fact
that
a
welfare
recipient
faced
with
termination
is
entitled
to
due
process
appropriate
to
the
circumstances.
this
to
me
does
not
necessarily
mean
the
type
of
due
process
that
would
be
appropriate
under
circumstances
of
criminal
law
or
civil
case
law
or
any
number
of
other
factual
patterns.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
there
are
many
facets
which
are
peculiar
to
welfare.
there
is
no
other
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
as
was
adverted
to
earlier
this
morning,
it
bears
some
resemblance
to
the
cases
where
public
employees
have
been
called
up
on
charges
and
suspended
but
later
given
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
there
is
a
situation
where
monetary
benefits
of
one
sort
or
another
or
ultimately
cutoff
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
well,
obviously
the
impact
on
the
individual
is
much
worse
if
we
make
an
error
in
the
case
of
someone
who
is
destitute
than
if
we
make
an
error
in
the
case
of
someone
who
is
well
off.
i
don't
doubt
that.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
definitely
would
be
inclined
and
my
position
is
that
this
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
don't
accept
the
hypothesis
sir
that
the
caseworker
has
a
closed
mind
at
the
time
he
advised
the
client
to
come
in.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
it
may
be
the
caseworker,
information
may
come
from
other
sources.
information
comes
to
the
welfare
department
from
many
sources.
it
may
come
from
a
bank,
from
a
landlady,
from
a
friend
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
that's
the
reason
he
is
called
in.
the
caseworker
has
some
information
which
he
wants
clarified.
he
gets
hold
of
information
which
is
of
sufficient
weight
that
he
says,
“i
need
a
personal
conference
with
this
person
to
hear
their
side
of
the
story
and
maybe
he
can
explain
this
away.”
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
your
honor
i
contend
that
it
is
part
of
a
procedure
which
when
taken
in
its
entirety
constitutes
such
basic
fairness
that
it
is
due
process
of
law.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
taken
altogether,
it
is
my
idea
of
fairness
but
not
truncating
it
and
chopping
it
off
at
one
little
chapter
and
saying,
“well,
this
is
all
the
due
process
the
person
is
going
to
get.”
that's
not
my
position.
but
that's
not
the
end
of
the
process.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
we've
had
the
meeting
with
the
caseworker.
we've
had
the
review
by
the
unit
supervisor.
we've
had
the
notice
go
out
to
the
client
that
gives
him
seven
days
to
come
in
with
any
written
information
with
the
aid
of
counsel
he'd
like
to
present.
that
is
then
reviewed
by
still
a
third
level
of
officials
who
has
no
personal
involvement
in
the
decision
at
the
caseworker
level.
this
supervisory
person
gets
the
record
and
anything
submitted
by
the
client,
reviews
the
entire
matter
and
its
only
after
he
is
satisfied
that
the
person
is
ineligible
that
the
benefits
are
cutoff.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
think
that
meets
due
process,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
new
york
regulation
prevents
those
decisions
being
all
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
have
to
admit
i'm
not
as
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
--
with
mariposa
county
as
might
be.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
believe
that
would
not
comply
with
the
state
regulation
in
new
york
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
under
the
new
regulation,
that's
right,
whether
it
could
happen,
i
can't
tell
you.
it
is
not
administratively
set
up
that
way
in
the
city
of
new
york
where
of
course
we
do
have
the
highest
the
volume
in
the
country.
so,
we
have
gone
through
these
three
layers
of
administrative
review
before
any
action
adverse
to
the
welfare
recipient
is
taken.
if
the
decision
ultimately
after
the
review
officer
has
gone
over
the
entire
matter
and
reached
the
conclusion,
if
he
decides
that
benefits
are
to
be
terminated,
a
notice
to
that
effect
is
sent
to
the
client
and
a
notice
also
includes
a
clear
statement
to
the
effect
that
the
decision
may
be
reviewed
in
a
fair
hearing.
and
what
i
suggested
to
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
entire
process
has
to
be
looked
on
in
order
to
see
whether
or
not
due
process
has
been
observed,
i
think
it
starts
with
the
initial
conference
with
the
caseworker
and
does
not
conclude
until
after
the
fair
hearing.
now
true
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes
sir,
under
article
78
of
the
new
york
civil
practice
law
and
rules,
any
decision
of
a
hearing
officer
that
results
in
a
denial
of
benefits,
the
person
whose
benefits
denied
is
considered
an
aggrieved
person
and
he
may
sue
the
state
hearing
officer
and
have
it
--
the
entire
package,
the
record
of
the
case
reviewed
by
a
state
supreme
court
justice.
so,
we
do
have
this
gap
that
can
occur
and
mr.
justice
marshall
is
entirely
right
and
there's
no
denying
that
a
person
who
is
in
fact
destitute
can
be
heard
between
the
period
when
the
review
officer
cuts
off
the
benefits
and
the
time
when
in
fact
we
are
wrong,
the
state's
fair
hearing
officer
restores
those
benefits.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
well,
there
is
evidence
in
the
case
that
it
varies
tremendously.
new
york
had
fallen
behind
beginning
about
in
1967.
i
might
point
out
in
the
first
half
of
1967,
fair
hearings
were
running
at
the
rate
of
200
or
300
per
month.
in
the
last
half
of
1967,
they
jumped
to
as
high
as
eleven
hundred
per
month.
now,
this
problem
has
been
alleviated
somewhat
the
total
number
of
hearing
officers
has
been
increased
by
50%.
we
had
only
8
for
the
state.
at
the
beginning
of
this
period
we
now
have
12
and
additional
staff
has
been
provided
so
as
mrs.
palmer
advised
the
court,
california
has
responded
to
the
increased
case
loads
so
as
new
york.
i
can't
tell
you
that
we
have
completely
caught
up
on
our
backlog,
we
haven't
but
we're
making
deep
inroads
into
it
and
we
hope
to
bring
the
state
of
new
york
into
compliance
with
the
time
table
that
the
federal
government
has
proposed.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes
sir.
now
i
would
point
out
to
you
that
in
this
case
in
addition
to
the
constitutional
issues
which
drew
the
focus
of
attention
in
the
court
below,
there
is
a
statutory
regulatory
scheme
which
provides
a
framework
with
when
--
within
which
the
case
could
also
be
examined.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
will
rest
on
either
your
honor.
i
claim
that
we
have
granted
due
process
if
it's
to
be
measured
by
constitutional
standards.
i
also
claim
here
and
i
believe
that
the
record
will
show
we
are
in
compliance
with
the
hew
regulations
on
this
subject.
hereto,
this
was
a
development
during
the
course
of
this
case;
the
regulation
to
which
i
refer
became
effective
july
1,
1968
well
after
this
cases
had
started.
but
the
regulation
is
set
forth
in
part
on
page
12
of
solicitor
general's
brief
and
it's
very
brief
if
i
may
refer
to
it,
its
cited
to
the
hew
handbook,
section
2300
(d)
(5)
and
it
states
that
advanced
notice
of
questions,
it
has
about
an
individual's
eligibility
so
that
a
recipient
has
an
opportunity
to
discuss
the
situation
before
receiving
formal
written
notice
of
reduction
in
payment
or
termination
of
assistance
is
required.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes.
we
have
not
denied
that.
i
just
point
this
regulatory
framework
out
to
afford
another
basis
for
the
court's
examination
if
you
wish.
the
court
below
turned
away
from
that
entirely
and
went
to
the
constitutional
issue.
but
we
do
not
here
claim
that
a
welfare
beneficiary
whose
benefits
are
about
to
be
terminated
is
not
entitled
to
some
pre-termination
procedures
--
constitutionally
entitled
to
some
pre-termination
procedure.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
do
sir.
you
will
note
that
the
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
believe
it
goes
as
far
as
the
solicitor
general's
brief
says
is
required.
i
would
point
out
to
you
that
annex
to
the
reply
brief
filed
by
my
opponent
is
another
brief
filed
in
the
court
below
in
which
the
federal
government
took
the
position
explicitly
that
both
subparagraph
(a)
of
the
regulation
and
(b)
complied
with
the
federal
regulation.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
that
comes
up
under
our
procedure
68-18,
the
local
procedure
adopted
to
implement
the
state
regulation.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
under
paragraph
(b).
and
that
procedure
had
to
obtain
state's
approval.
in
other
words
we
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
procedure
68-18
appears
in
the
record
following
pages
147,
148a.
it's
annex
to
an
affidavit
of
the
appellate
here,
the
commissioner
of
social
welfare,
jack
goldberg.
i
consider
those
procedures
adopted
through
the
local
regulation
as
complimentary
to
the
state
regulation.
we
couldn't
have
implemented
the
state
regulation
without
adopting
local
procedures
and
i
believe
that
we
are
properly
entitled
to
be
judged
by
what
we
actually
did,
not
by
theoretically
what
we
might
have
done
and
these
procedures
of
course
were
before
the
court
below.
they
were
not
adopted
after
the
decisions
at
that
time.
the
regulation
by
the
state
came
out
in
the
spring
of
1968,
the
revised
regulation.
it
took
--
i
would
say
roughly
close
to
a
month
before
the
regulation
became
effective
in
new
york
city.
during
part
of
that
month,
the
review
officers
had
to
be
selected
and
guidelines
had
to
be
developed.
in
addition,
the
procedure
that
the
city
of
new
york
intended
to
follow
had
to
be
submitted
to
the
state
for
its
approval.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes
sir.
it
is
the
city's
procedure
which
imposes
first
of
all
the
duty
on
the
case
worker
to
call
the
client
in
for
a
conference
and
explain
to
him
the
reasons
why
his
benefits
may
be
terminated.
i
stress
the
fact,
maybe
terminated
nothing
has
happen
at
this
point.
the
client
has
called
in
and
told
that
we
have
certain
information
which
leads
us
to
believe
that
you
may
no
longer
be
eligible.
the
client
of
course
has
an
opportunity
to
rebut,
to
explain
or
to
say
anything
he
had
liked
in
response
to
this
information.
following
that
conference
which
is
summarized
in
some
detail
by
the
caseworker,
all
of
the
information
concerning
this
matter
is
referred
to
the
unit
supervisor.
this
is
a
man
next
up
the
ladder
above
the
caseworker.
the
unit
supervisor
reviews
the
whole
matter
and
that
it
is
only
--
if
only
concurs
that
the
notice
contemplated
by
this
paragraph
be
goes
out,
still
no
benefits
have
been
terminated.
the
client
receives
a
notice
saying
that
your
benefits
may
be
terminated
within
seven
days,
unless
you
request
a
review.
the
reasons
for
the
proposed
termination
are
as
follows
and
then
the
reasons
are
explained
and
it
further
goes
on
to
say
that
if
you
which
to
have
a
review,
you
may
submit
anything
you
would
like
for
review
by
a
review
officer
and
you
may
have
the
assistance
of
counsel
in
submitting
anything
that
you
would
like.
now,
this
submission
does
not
constitute
a
hearing
in
the
classic
sense
in
our
confrontation
with
witnesses.
but
it
is
the
continuation
of
the
process
that
began
with
a
face
to
face
meeting
between
the
caseworker
and
the
client
and
it
does
bring
in
to
play
another
and
a
higher
official
who
has
no
stake
in
the
decision
reached
by
those
subordinate
officials
below.
and
it
is
only
after
his
review
that
any
impact
in
any
monetary
sense
is
felt
by
the
client.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
there
is
state
law
provisions
for
fair
hearings
but
it
--
the
reason
that
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes
sir
it
does.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
well,
the
fair
hearing
requirement
originates
in
federal
law
and
any
state
plans
submitted
to
the
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes
sir,
there
is.
i
can't
cite
it
to
you
off
hand
but
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
alright,
that's
easier
for
me.
a
state
fair
hearing
is
a
hearing
in
the
traditional
sense.
by
that
i
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
there
is
a
state
hearing
officer
first
of
all,
not
a
city
official.
these
original
decisions
that
i'm
talking
about
to
terminate
are
at
the
city
level.
the
hearing
officer
on
a
state
fair
hearing
is
a
state
official.
evidence
is
introduced
although
it
is
administrative
rules
of
evidence
that
apply
and
by
that
i
mean
it
is
possible
that
some
hearsay
may
be
introduced
as
is
true
in
most
administrative
proceedings.
the
client
whose
benefits
may
be
terminated
or
restored
has
a
right
to
examine
before
the
hearing
any
evidence
that
the
state
or
the
city
intends
to
introduce
against
him.
in
other
words,
if
there
are
written
documents
involved,
they
must
be
displayed
to
the
recipient
or
his
counsel
in
advance
of
the
hearing.
witnesses
are
examined
and
a
verbatim
transcript
is
made
of
the
proceedings
and
a
writ
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
the
regulations
require
that
sir.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
and
finally
a
written
decision
comes
down.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
will
give
it
to
you
subsequently.
i
don't
have
it
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
have
reserved
one
or
two
minutes
for
rebuttal
and
when
i
rebut,
i
will
give
you
the
precise
citation
to
the
statute
and
to
the
regulations
that
give
you
the
details.
they
are
substantially
as
i
have
outlined
them
to
your
honor
and
i
will
reserve
that
opportunity
if
i
may
for
that
time.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
if
the
court
please.
i
ask
--
particularly
believe
that
mr.
justice
black
to
check
the
citation.
you
had
asked
me
sir
where
we
could
find
the
regulations
that
would
describe
the
rights
afforded,
those
who
appear
in
a
state
fair
hearing.
it
is
in
our
record,
following
page
160.
and
i
particularly
refer
to
you
--
to
section
84
of
the
state
regulations
and
more
particularly
beginning
on
page
2,
it
describes
the
entire
procedure
from
the
time
a
request
was
made.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
it
follows
page
160
of
the
record.
immediately
following
that
page
is
a
resolution
of
the
state
board
of
social
welfare
which
goes
for
two
pages
and
then
begins
regulation
number
84.2
and
that
entire
regulation
deals
with
the
procedure
under
the
state
fair
hearings.
and
you
will
find
among
other
things,
there
is
a
notice
of
the
hearing
which
gives
all
the
details,
you
would
need
to
note
to
go
the
proper
place
and
tell
you
who
you're
going
to
appear
before
and
advice
you
of
the
right
of
each
party
to
be
represented
to
testify,
produce
witnesses,
to
present
documentary
evidence
and
to
examine
opposing
witnesses
and
evidence.
84.9
gives
you
the
right
to
examine
the
other
sides
evidence
in
advance
of
the
hearing.
it
points
out
that
the
hearing
is
to
be
conducted
by
any
impartial
hearing
officer.
it
goes
on
to
detail
the
burden
of
the
hearing
officer
to
render
a
written
opinion,
what
the
content
shall
be
that
the
decision
must
be
sent
to
the
client
and
that
he
be
advised
upon
recede
of
the
decision
of
his
right
to
judicial
review
under
new
york
law.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
well,
under
federal
regulations,
they're
supposed
to
take
place
and
be
completed
within
60
days.
this
is
the
60
day
period
that
has
been
referred
to
previously
in
the
discussion
this
morning.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
now.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
don't
of
any.
the
pattern
would
not
be
much
different
under
the
home
relief
cases
under
any
of
the
others.
now
i
would
refer
if
i
may
to
the
section
of
my
main
brief
on
pages
14
and
15.
our
procedures
have
been
sharply
criticized
here
and
it
has
been
pointed
out
by
my
adversary
that
under
paragraph
(a)
which
is
his
preferred
procedure,
a
number
of
reversals
of
caseworker
decisions
have
occurred.
we
had
a
brief
period,
just
a
few
months
roughly
from
june
to
november
of
1968
during
which
the
city
of
new
york
operated
under
the
provisions
subparagraph
(b)
in
its
local
procedure,
6818.
during
that
period,
approximately
44%
of
the
decisions
to
terminate
were
reversed
as
a
result
of
our
own
procedures.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
our
procedures
were
working
and
during
that
same
period
of
time,
as
is
true
now,
some
of
our
cases
then
went
on
to
the
fair
hearing
stage.
during
those
same
months,
the
reversals
on
termination
cases
after
fair
hearings
did
not
exceed
three
cases
per
month
and
in
one
month,
september
1968,
there
were
no
reversals.
i
think
this
is
a
demonstration
that
goes
beyond
the
face
of
the
regulations
itself
that
the
procedure
is
designed
to
be
fair.
it
is
designed
to
weed
out
error
and
it
works.
this
court
has
on
other
occasions
and
in
other
contexts
molded
constitutional
requirements
appropriate
to
the
facts.
due
process
has
been
described
as
a
flexible,
not
a
fixed
concept.
it
might
also
be
noted
that
under
the
fourth
amendment,
in
the
kamara
and
see
cases
where
there
was
a
question
of
the
burden
of
proof
on
a
locality
before
a
warrant
should
be
issued.
it
was
found
by
this
court
that
the
burden
of
proof
need
not
be
quite
as
high
as
in
a
traditional
criminal
warrant
search
and
seizure.
there
is
room
for
innovation
at
the
local
level,
in
state
and
local
governments
and
i
feel
that
our
innovation
meets
the
standards
that
this
court
has
indicated
or
required
for
due
process.
