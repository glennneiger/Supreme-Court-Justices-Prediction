mr.
lee
a.
albert
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
discussing
the
procedures
that
had
been
added
since
this
case
was
or
the
administrative
changes
since
this
case
was
before
the
district
court
in
--
between
january
and
june
1968,
it
is
well,
i
think
to
look
at
briefly
the
situation,
the
procedures
used
for
the
terminations
of
the
20
appellees,
not
each
one,
individually
of
course
in
this
very
case.
each
of
them
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
those
i
think
are
the
situations
mr.
justice
white
that
present
the
typical
issues
of
a
contested
termination.
that
is
to
say
the
typical
kind
of
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
those
are
certainly
the
people
who
still
--
who
--
but
for
this
lawsuit
and
the
injunction
below
are
faced
with
the
same
kinds
of
termination
problems
that
they
already
experienced.
many
of
them
were
restored
to
aid
solely
by
virtue
of
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
mr.
justice
white,
some
of
the
interveners
in
this
suit
were
actually
terminated
under
the
new
york
change,
that
is
the
option
b
procedure
the
city
wishes
to
reinstate
by
virtue
of
this
appeal.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white.
others
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i
think
mr.
justice
white,
all
of
them
present
the
kinds
of
that
the
--
and
because
they
continue
to
receive
welfare
benefits
and
therefore
are
confronted
with
the
same
kinds
of
issues
of
termination
or
unlikely
to
be
confronted
with
such
issues
very
similar
to
a
kind
of
union
employer
continuing
relationship,
one
strike
being
settled
doesn't
necessarily
solve
all
the
legal
problems
for
the
future.
i
think
that
the
--
we're
really
confronted
with
all
those
cases
of
the
people
who
still
continue
to
receive
benefits
who
still
are
involved
in
this
case,
work
relationship.
the
terminations
of
the
appellees,
i
think
can
be
grouped
briefly
and
to
several
categories.
it's
important
to
note
that
all
of
them
had
a
conference
or
interview
with
their
caseworker
before
termination.
indeed,
that
interview
which
is
part
of
--
which
is
long
been
required
for
the
periodic
recertification
of
eligibility
in
new
york
and
most
other
states,
all
other
states
was
actually
the
cause
of
termination
in
many
of
this
cases.
for
example,
appellee
john
kelly,
a
new
york
peevee
terminated
because
during
that
interview,
they
had
a
dispute
with
the
caseworker
about
where
they
should
live.
as
a
result
of
their
disagreement
with
the
caseworker
over
where
they
should
live
that
they
were
terminated.
two
weeks
before
angela
velez
who
has
discussed
the
opinion
of
judge
feinberg
below,
before
she
was
terminated,
she
had
an
argument
with
her
caseworker
over
an
extraneous
matter,
over
a
special
grant
and
she
asked,
actually
asked
the
caseworker
to
leave
the
home.
two
weeks
later,
she
received
the
notice
of
termination
informing
her
i
should
say,
she
was
terminated
for
concealment
of
assets,
nothing
further.
during
a
hearing
subsequently
it
was
found
out
that
refer
to
a
landlady's
report
to
the
caseworker
that
her
husband
had
returned
home.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
mr.
justice
stewart
all
the
procedures
except
for
--
well,
some
of
them
have
taken
place
under
all
the
procedures
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
these
particular
ones,
there
was
no
option
b.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
and
that
opportunity
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
but
mr.
justice
stewart
all
--
the
process
that
has
been
described
by
the
city
--
the
city
does
not
rely
on
option
b
as
a
particularly
important
element.
i
don't
think
in
that
process,
they
rely
on
the
whole
process.
i'm
merely
trying
to
establish
mr.
justice
stewart
that
there
was
a
certainty
--
the
caseworker
interview
and
the
unit
supervisor
approval,
the
consultation
with
the
unit
supervisor
that
mr.
loflin
has
mentioned
long
before
option
b
was
added,
option
b
provides
one
further
step.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
that
one
--
that
several
of
the
appellees
did
invoke
in
this
case,
for
example,
one
of
the
appellees
antonio
sotto
was
terminated
for
he
received
a
notice
informing
him
failure
to
attend
rehabilitation
coc,
and
i
should
say
your
honors
that
that
notice
meant
as
much
to
him
at
that
point
as
it
may
mean
to
you
now.
he
did
not
know
what
rehabilitation
coc
was.
it
turns
out
upon
investigation
that
the
caseworker
believed
that
he
was
taking
drugs
and
they
had
a
dispute
over
that
and
she
wanted
him
to
attend
some
particular
rehabilitation
center.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
the
basis
i
think
for
the
ambiguity
is
the
fact
that
we're
dealing
with
formed
notices
issued
by
caseworkers
with
very,
very
heavy
caseloads
and
this
is
to
be
sure
an
assembly
line
type
of
operation
in
that
regard.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
well,
in
fact
in
his
particular
case,
he
unlike
most
welfare
recipients
did
have
an
attorney
to
assist
them
mr.
chief
justice
and
his
attorney
found
out
the
case
unit
to
find
out
some
information.
that's
reflected
in
the
record
and
his
attorney,
mr.
greenberg,
has
written
an
affidavit
that's
in
this
record.
the
information
wasn't
very
helpful.
he,
unlike
most
recipients
received
a
copy
of
the
review
decision
under
this
option
b
which
judge
feinberg
refers
to
in
his
opinion
below
and
the
review
decision
by
the
case
supervisor,
this
neutral
official
states
that
mr.
sotto
was
terminated
because
he
was
a
parricide,
because
he
was
playing
a
game.
i'm
quoting
from
that
decision
and
which
is
also
printed
in
the
record
mr.
chief
justice.
as
to
the
facts
involved,
mr.
sotto
has
never
yet
learned
just
what
this
dispute
was
about
nor
has
his
attorney
mr.
greenberg.
upon
intervention
in
this
lawsuit,
the
city
dropped
the
term
“parricide
and
playing
a
game”
and
restart
them
to
the
roles.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
his
restoration
probably
was
retroactive
mr.
chief
justice
but
i'm
not
clear
on
that.
certainly
from
july
1,
1968,
upon
subsequent
vindications
in
the
subsequent
fair
hearing,
the
payments
themselves
are
retroactive.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
his
benefits
were
not
terminated
for
any
length
of
time
because
he
was
--
he
did
intervene
in
this
lawsuit
soon
afterwards.
i
think
in
terms
of
your
question,
i
think
one
--
if
one
looked
at
the
cases
such
as
--
there
are
few
interveners
here.
the
harms
in
this
case
were
minimized
for
most
of
the
appellees
by
virtue
of
this
lawsuit.
there
were
a
few
however
who
came
into
this
lawsuit,
who
came
to
attorneys,
late
in
the
process
of
termination
while
they
were
awaiting
the
fair
hearing
as
in
the
case
of
(inaudible)
and
angela
velez.
in
their
particular
cases,
as
this
record
makes
clear,
they
suffered
eviction,
living
in
one
room
with
four
children
in
a
sister's
overcrowded
apartment,
living
on
handouts,
attending
harlem
hospital
for
treatment
of
dysentery.
mrs.
(inaudible)
in
the
welfare
center
while
waiting
for
an
emergency
grant
for
food.
the
retroactive
payments
based
on
the
amount
of
money
that
she
would
have
received
had
the
case
--
had
this
not
been
--
had
there
been
deliberation
before
termination.
had
there
been
an
examination
of
this
decision
that
she
contested
from
the
outset
surely
cannot
in
any
way
be
commensurate
or
in
any
way
repair
ameliorate
those
kinds
of
indignities,
those
kinds
of
harms
and
of
course
no
one
is
entitled
to
damages
for
those
kinds
of
injuries.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
a
--
it
most
certainly
is.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
it
most
certainly
is
mr.
chief
justice.
the
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
he
was
vindicated
after
this
procedure
was
passed
in
the
fair
hearing.
he
is
still
or
she,
i
should
say
and
most
of
these
appellees
are
still
receiving
welfare
benefits
and
still
face
the
procedures
that
are
to
be
used
in
regard
to
a
termination
of
those
benefits.
indeed
some
of
the
termination
issues
in
regard
to
some
of
the
appellees,
he
was
never
even
resolved
the
city
just
because
of
this
lawsuit
finding
these
people
as
something
different
because
of
this
lawsuit
dropped
the
matter
of
termination.
we
think
that
the
--
were
the
--
they're
not
in
these
lawsuits,
they
are
faced
with
that
ever
present
danger
and
of
course
they
do
represent
the
class
of
individuals
very
similarly
situated.
our
legal
argument
is
based
essentially
on
three
prepositions.
the
first
is
that
the
due
process
guarantees
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
against
government
arbitrariness
and
capriciousness
apply
to
the
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
no.
the
due
process
--
the
guarantee
that
no
person
shall
be
deprived
of
life,
liberty,
or
property
without
due
process
of
law,
that
guarantee
we
submit
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
without
due
process
of
law,
without
the
proceedings
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
no,
mr.
justice
black.
we're
not
relying
on
notions
of
reasonableness
or
arbitrariness
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
with
--
we're
relying
on
the
well-established
obligation
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
we
think
that
the
procedural
aspect
of
due
process
is
not
--
does
not
permit
the
latitude
or
leave
the
justices
at
bay
in
the
sense
that
substantive
due
process
may
be
said
to.
we're
talking
about
those
procedures
which
this
court
time
and
time
again
has
deemed
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
we
--
i
mean
notice
and
the
elements
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i
think
due
process,
its
well
accepted
mr.
justice
black
but
due
process
refers
to
a
adversary
proceeding
proceeded
by
notice.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
there
may
be
some
question
as
to
what
context,
what
it
requires
in
certain
context
but
i
think
the
point
here
is
that
it's
conceded
mr.
justice
black
that
the
due
process
guarantees
against
our
government
arbitrariness
and
capriciousness
apply
to
public
assistance
programs.
that's
not
really
an
issue
here.
none
of
the
parties
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
nor
is
it
an
issue
--
certainly
its
not
an
issue
in
the
government's
view
also
in
its
memorandum
and
nor
i
think
properly
viewed
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
certainly
not
mr.
justice
white
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
established
that
preposition
de
novo
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i
think
--
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
say
why
it
does,
no
question,
i
do.
and
i'd
like
to
briefly
address
myself
to
why
that
concession
is
well
founded.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i
think
one
has
to
make
some
certain
distinctions
mr.
justice
black.
if
you're
talking
about
an
emergency
handout
program
in
a
period
of
disaster
or
if
we're
talking
about
the
19th
century
pattern
of
relief,
the
19th
century
distribution
of
benefits,
private
or
public
for
which
there
was
very
little
distinction,
i
think
it's
quite
different
from
the
kinds
of
programs
we're
dealing
with
here.
concededly
these
programs
establish
a
statutory
entitlement
for
all
eligible
individuals.
concededly
that
entitlement
cannot
be
denied
or
revoked
i
should
say
without
an
administrative
finding
that
the
person
is
no
longer
eligible.
concededly,
eligibility
--
that
finding
must
be
supported
by
evidence.
concededly
where
a
caseworker
to
merely
terminate
a
person
because
i
don't
like
--
because
he
didn't
like
the
color
of
his
hair
for
example,
that
would
be
arbitrary
administrative
action
under
these
programs
and
unconstitutional,
that
would
be
a
denial
of
due
process.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
mr.
justice
black
i
think
it's
very
important
that
--
we
recognize
we're
not
dealing
with
the
kind
of
program
that
you've
mentioned
regarding
the
civil
war.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
not
at
all.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i
think
the
question
of
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
certainly
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
left
off
before
the
lunch
time,
recess
on
the
threshold
and
fundamental
question
of
whether
the
due
process
procedural
guarantees
apply
to
public
assistance
benefits
at
all.
if
one
looks
to
the
nature
of
the
factors
that
this
court
has
traditionally
deemed
relevant,
the
nature
of
the
individual
interest,
the
nature
of
the
government
interest,
the
burden
on
the
program
or
proceedings,
one
finds
that
all
of
those
factors
compel
one
answer.
the
nature
of
the
individual
interest
is
what's
examined
is
in
a
statutory
entitlement
of
enormous
value
to
the
beholders,
a
statutory
entitlement
on
which
the
very
quality
of
life
depends.
this
record
makes
very
clear
the
consequences
of
erroneous
withdrawal
of
that
entitlement.
it
is
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i
think
that
factor
of
gravity
of
harm
mr.
justice
white
is
reflected
in
for
example
the
deportation
of
alien
cases
in
which
the
agency
is
held
to
the
highest
degree
of
procedural
safeguards
before
an
alien
may
be
deported
though
he
has
no
vested
right
to
remain
here.
but
because
as
this
court
once
said,
deportation
may
deprive
one
of
all
that
makes
life
worth
living.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
fleming
and
nestor
refers
to
--
the
question
in
fleming
--
fleming
and
nestor
is
support
for
our
proposition.
it
certainly
said
that
the
statutory
entitlement
under
oasdi
is
within
the
due
process
guarantees
against
arbitrariness
and
capriciousness.
it
only
went
on
to
say
an
issue
not
involved
here,
whether
it's
vested
in
all
circumstances
or
other
circumstances
where
it's
not
vested.
we
are
not
arguing
with
the
substantive
grounds
but
they're
relevant
to
the
procedures.
we're
not
arguing
with
the
substantive
grounds
of
revocation
whatsoever
nor
are
we
arguing
with
congress'
power
or
the
state's
power
to
answer
those
grounds
or
indeed
--
to
use
an
extreme
example
to
do
away
with
these
programs.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
programs
exist.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
it
certainly
could
mr.
justice
stewart
except
for
the
--
what
we
do,
except
for
the
fact
that
we
have
figures
in
this
record
and
no
one
really
argues
about
them
at
the
rate
of
administrative
error
in
denying
or
terminating
aid
is
enormous.
the
rate
reflect
on
the
face
of
case
records.
this
only
is
the
caseworker's
version
of
why
she
terminated
it
which
is
meant
to
obviously
reflect
a
proper
version
to
sustain
the
decision
so
to
speak.
the
national
rate
there
is
between
6%
and
7%
on
the
face
of
the
case
record
of
erroneous
terminations.
the
figures
upon
the
reversals
in
those
hearings
and
in
particular
on
the
prior
hearings,
range
from
at
least
25%
to
up
to
51%
in
new
york
city
today.
it
can't
be
said
that
the
contested
decision
is
to
terminate.
we
agree
that
people
come
on
welfare
in
periods
of
temporary
crisis
and
they
go
off
welfare.
and
usually
most
terminations
are
by
agreement
with
caseworker.
those
we
have
no
concern
with.
our
concern
is
with
those
in
which
the
recipient
disagrees
with
the
caseworker
and
wishes
to
contest
that
caseworker's
decision.
in
that
narrow
group
of
cases,
we
find
that
the
times
in
which
the
recipient
as
opposed
to
the
caseworker
is
correct
is
enormous,
the
rate
of
error
is
just
startling,
it's
singular
i
think
in
the
government
benefit
program.
nonetheless,
these
decisions
are
not
vindicated
in
subsequent
fair
hearings
for
a
variety
of
reasons
not
the
least
of
which
is
that
the
overwhelming
impact,
the
interim
deprivations
and
equally
important
the
fact
that
the
timing
of
the
hearing
is
wholly
in
the
hands
of
the
government
is
not
without
significance
here.
no
one
really
argues
that
the
hew
60
day
rule
now
enforce
for
several
years
is
anything
but
theoretical.
the
period
reflected
in
this
case
and
still
reflected
in
new
york
range
from
anything
from
4
months
to
as
much
as
8
months.
we're
not
using
used
examples.
but
for
4
months
to
8
months
or
even
60
days
mr.
justice
stewart
to
go
without
the
very
subsistence,
food,
for
clothing,
shelter
and
money
for
--
i'm
sorry
your
honors,
money
for
food,
clothing
and
shelter
does
not
leave
one
in
any
positions
--
engaged
in
a
legal
wrangle
with
the
welfare
department.
we
don't
know
what
happens
to
those
people.
the
mystery
though
is
by
no
means
reassuring.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
mr.
justice
marshall,
there's
nothing
one
can
do
about
the
systematic
sustained
delay
in
the
fair
hearing
process.
indeed
the
attempts
to
retain
civil
relief
in
the
new
york
courts
is
met
with
the
answer
that
this
is
directory.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
they
didn't
have
money
to
process
their
appeal.
there
isn't
a
cost
in
processing
the
appeal.
they
didn't
have
the
wherewithal,
they
didn't
have
the
weight,
they
were
concerned
with
the
problems
of
daily
living
and
survival,
the
eviction
and
the
like
which
accounts
for
this
kind
of
low
rate.
it
certainly
isn't
in
the
timing
of
the
hearing,
the
fact
or
significance
in
the
timing,
it
is
not
the
practicalities
of
the
situation,
that
is
the
kind
of
hearing
involved,
the
number
of
issues
or
witnesses
that
account
for
a
delay.
as
we
well
know,
welfare
termination
hearings
unlike
most
administrative
proceedings
of
this
court
deals
with
--
involved
one
or
two
issues
at
most
one
outside
source
of
information
or
to
take
utmost
a
half
to
1
one
hour.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
how
--
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
those
one
and
two
issues
fall
into
several
categories.
one
is,
the
landlady
said
that
her
husband
has
returned
home.
the
board
of
education
says
she's
working
for
her
now.
just
to
use
the
instant
cases,
which
aren't
too
typical
or
the
caseworker
says
you
haven't
co-operated
properly.
you
haven't
permitted
to
see
this.
you
haven't
cooperated
in
bringing
your
missing
husband
to
heal.
and
these
are
all
evaluative
judgments
that
the
–
under
very
vague
standards
which
arise
from
this
very
personal
relationship
and
very
singular
to
welfare,
i
should
say,
between
a
caseworker
and
a
recipient.
that
relationship
being
imbued
with
notions
of
warship
treatment,
rehabilitation
as
well
as
the
pleasing
function
of
eligibility.
those
are
the
typical
issues
in
contested
terminations.
and
we
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
one
cannot
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
he
gets
an
average
grant
mr.
justice
black
for
approximately
$60
to
65$
a
month,
somewhat
less
for
children.
and
that
is
to
take
care
of
all
--
plus
rent,
i'm
sorry,
plus
rent.
that
has
taken
all
his
non-rent
needs,
rent
is
paid
within
certain
limits
as
it's
actually
incur
and
nothing
more.
there's
no
question
that
the
level
of
aid
is
penurious
an
to
an
extreme.
the
resource
policy
requiring
you
to
yield
resources
when
you're
found
eligible
and
to
continue
to
yield
resources
to
the
welfare
department
afterwards
ensures
that
you
cannot
budget
for
any
contingency
including
administrative
error.
it
is
not
though
the
practicalities
that
protract
the
hearing
process,
that's
revealed
in
the
fact
that
in
those
states
in
which
prior
hearings
are
now
afforded.
the
pattern
of
timing
is
from
one
to
two
weeks
and
that's
really
what
we're
talking
about
when
we
looked
to
the
so-called
cost
of
the
extra
costs
or
the
burdens
on
the
system
which
has
certainly
been
a
relevant
--
is
a
relevant
factor.
we
do
not
argue
the
constitution
requires
the
impractical
or
the
impossible.
there
is
neither
of
that
here.
nor
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i
certainly
did
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
there
are
approximately
four
or
five
pursuant
to
court
orders
who
are
agreements,
stipulations
during
the
course
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
new
york
state
is
the
best
example
of
that.
in
new
york
state,
new
york
city
in
particular,
it
is
the
largest
welfare
department
in
the
country
including
any
state
welfare
department
i
should
add.
but
the
largest
number
of
recipients
presumably
relatively
more
sophisticated
recipients,
relatively
greater
access
to
legal
assistance
to
--
so
it
provides
a
good
test
case
for
the
notion
of
what
kind
of
burden
this
will
incur.
the
burden
that
incurs,
one
or
evidence
in
the
fact
that
new
york
state
which
shares
half
of
these
costs
is
not
here
today.
the
burden
that
incurs
is
more
better
revealed
in
the
fact
that
out
of
60,000
terminations
and
of
course
the
five
months
in
new
york
city,
there
were
1,000
prior
hearings
requested
out
of
which
51%
were
the
recipient
prevailed.
even
under
the
government's
test
in
its
memorandum
of
whether
more
eligible
than
ineligible
people
request
these
hearings,
we
would
prevail
in
this
case.
the
city
--
in
comparing
also
those
additional
costs
for
the
one
or
two
weeks
and
after
all
the
only
--
we
believe
permissible
additional
costs
that
can
be
considered
here
are
those
that
are
ultimately
one
or
two
week
payments
to
people
who
are
ultimately
found
ineligible.
in
comparing
that,
one
must
also
look
to
the
kind
of
cumbersome
procedure
that
new
york
city
seems
to
offer.
we
would
say
it's
totally
an
effective
one,
the
written
review
type
thing
and
all
these
supervisors
talking
to
each
other.
but
that
certainly
must
cost
and
take
time
too.
the
entire
operation
in
new
york
city
with
10,000
closings
a
month
entails
six
review
officers.
now,
i
will
grant
you
compared
to
the
state
fair
hearing
process
which
only
has
ten
altogether
for
the
entire
state,
that's
quite
a
few.
but
in
terms
of
actual
monetary
burdens
on
the
system,
six
review
officers,
we
submit
in
a
welfare
department
with
a
budget
of
the
city
of
new
york
such
as
it
has,
is
de
minimis,
its
just
not
a
factor
that
really
can
be
accounted
for.
we
also
would
ask
this
court
to
recognize
in
looking
at
the
burdens
or
non-burdens
that
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
effect
of
the
present
procedure
of
postponing
and
seriously
postponing
the
fair
hearing
is
to
deter
and
discourage
its
use
to
the
extent
that
prior
hearings
will
be
used
more
as
a
result
of
removing
this
deterrence.
we
don't
think
those
are
appropriate
costs
for
the
simple
reason
we
think
if
any
policy
of
deliberately
forestalling
a
constitutional
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
order
to
discourage
its
use
regardless
of
the
merits
of
the
claims,
we
think
would
be
impermissible,
the
right
to
be
heard
and
must
be
more
than
a
theoretical
or
a
nominal
one.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
the
federal
government
isn't
talking
about
a
hearing
mr.
justice
white
when
it
talks
about
the
advanced
notice
of
questions.
it
talks
about
a
caseworker
which
has
been
done
for
a
long
time,
it's
really
nothing
new,
tells
a
recipient
--
involves
the
recipient
in
the
re-determination
process.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
we're
talk
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
absolutely
not
mr.
justice
white.
we're
talking
about
the
absolute
rudiments
of
an
adversary
proceeding
where
the
recipient
requests
it.
by
that
we
mean,
only
that
the
caseworker
presents
the
case
to
a
relatively
uninvolved
official,
the
recipient
hears
the
case,
after
all
that's
the
first
opportunity
the
recipient
has
to
learn
of
the
cases
at
this
hearing,
those
cryptic
notices
will
not
reveal
the
case.
has
an
opportunity
to
hear
the
evidence
and
question
the
caseworker
of
course
and
those
are
facts
about
the
recipient,
functionally,
those
are
facts
very
intimately
about
that
particular
person
and
obviously
our
--
the
assumption
of
our
system
is
that
that
person
is
in
the
best
position
to
refute
them
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
where
there
is
--
where
the
termination,
which
is
not
all
the
cases
mr.
justice
white
rest
entirely
on
third
party
information,
the
landlady
said
“blank.”
mr.
lee
a.
albert
or
in
part,
well,
alright,
or
in
part
and
not
substantiated
by
other
documentary
evidence
that
say
to
third
parties.
yes,
in
that
case
where
the
credibility
of
those
witnesses
is
called
into
question,
we
say
those
witnesses
have
to
be
there
so
that
the
recipient
can
question
and
there
is
no
way
to
rebut
anonymous
accusations.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
in
cases
it
said,
“where
the
veracity
--
where
the
evidence
depends
on
the
veracity
or
credibility
of
third
parties.”
mr.
lee
a.
albert
and
critical
to
the
case,
yes.
mr.
justice
white,
we're
not
asking
to
spell
out
a
code
of
welfare
procedure.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
this
--
well,
this
issue
really
is
not
involved
in
this
case
there's
not
one
of
the
appellees
who
raisethe
question
of
law.
we
are
not
arguing
now,
lets
be
clear,
we
are
not
--
to
use
the
government's
example
that
--
we're
not
arguing
that
where
there's
across
the
board
reduction
by
the
legislature
or
the
regulation,
in
those
--
and
the
validity
of
that
reduction
is
being
challenged
as
a
legal
matter.
in
those
situations
you're
entitled
to
prior
hearings.
we
agree
that
questions
of
statutory
validity
or
constitutional
validity
are
much
more
appropriate
for
the
judicial
process
than
for
administrative
hearings.
administrative
agencies
don't
have
the
power
to
resolve
those
questions.
we're
not
talking
about
that.
the
application
of
regulations
as
in
the
case
of
mrs.
guzman
for
example,
we
are
including
of
course,
that's
where
the
caseworkers
states
that
she
thinks
there's
a
policy
of
this
kind
of
cooperation,
the
recipient
states
that
there's
no
such
policy,
certainly
the
policy
is
based
on
whether
there
are
justifiable
reasons
not
to
participate
in
this
lawsuit.
the
department
recognizes
that
and
that
kind
of
a
situation,
that's
an
application
of
a
regulation
in
the
evaluative
regulation
at
that.
we
submit
that
that
requires
the
hearing
but
not
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
certainly
as
far
as
the
due
process
clause
in
the
constitution
is
concerned,
we
are
not
asking
for
two
hearings,
we
are
not
asking
for
appeals,
we
don't
care
if
the
hearing
examiner
salary
is
paid
by
the
city
or
the
state.
we
think
there
are
different
view
points
on
that
as
indicated
in
the
state
commissioner's
view
point
and
hew's
--
perhaps
hew
view
point.
those
are
considerations
that
really
have
little
to
do
with
the
due
process
clause.
we're
only
asking
for
one
constitutionally
adequate
opportunity
to
be
heard
at
a
meaningful
time,
at
a
time
when
recipients
can
use
that
at
a
time
when
the
remedy
can
be
effective,
that
is
to
say
one
when
it
can
provide
relief
against
the
kinds
of
harms
that
are
reflected
in
this
record.
we
think
that
one
thing
that
has
been
left
out
that
should
be
stressed
here
is
that
a
good
part
of
the
reason
for
due
process
procedural
guarantees
is
because
government
arbitrariness
regardless
of
the
context
is
still
government
arbitrariness
and
therefore
unconstitutional.
we
think
that
the
dangers
of
arbitrariness
in
this
system
are
about
as
great
as
any
administrative
program
one
can
think
of.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
absolutely
not,
first
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
well,
for
factors
one
observed
in
cafeteria
workers
against
mcelroy,
the
government
engaged
in
a
managerial
function
as
employer
to
the
discretionary
kinds
of
decisions
which
are
slightly
different
and
three,
the
question
of
a
suspension
of
an
employee
may
well
fall
into
one
of
those
extraordinary
situations
laid
out
by
this
court
where
for
example,
the
employee
represents
some
immediate
threat
to
the
service
or
the
department.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
there
might
be
at
least
the
requirement
of
--
as
indeed,
there's
the
practice
in
the
federal
civil
service
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i
don't
--
but
i
think
an
important
--
i
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
white.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
we
are
not
litigating
a
variety
of
government
benefit
programs
or
government
employment
which
involves
factors
that
are
very
different
than
the
ones
here.
there
are
many
benefit
programs
that
provide
for
benefits
to
continue
after
eligibility
is
ceased,
social
security,
oasdi
and
disability.
the
one
area
where
there
might
be
dispute
is
one
of
those
programs,
civil
service
mentions
another.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i'm
sorry.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
it's
correct
mr.
justice
harlan.
that
was
promulgated
a
year
ago
by
hew.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
ithink
it
verifies
that
the
fair
hearing
requirement
of
the
federal
act
which
after
all
does
import
notions
of
due
process
into
it
cannot
be
truly
effective
unless
the
hearing
is
prior.
and
that's
what
hew
said
when
it
promulgated
the
regulation.
it
has
been
postponed
mr.
justice
harlan
till
next
july
over
opposition,
over
a
variety
of
oppositions.
some
like
new
york
which
prefers
the
local
agency
hearings.
some
states
just
don't
like
federal
encouragence,
additional
procedural
impositions
under
hew's
power.
we
think
the
relevance
is
that
it
represents
the
judgment
of
the
administrative
agency
charged
knowing
something
about
these
matters
that
that
is
required
and
that
still
current
federal
policy
although
not
presently
not
–
it's
effective
data
is
postponed.
it's
still
part
of
the
federal
regulations
as
is
the
federal
matching
formulas
to
encourage
states
to
continue
aid.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
it's
still
supposed
to
be
a
requirement
of
that
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
if
it
--
if
and
when
it
goes
into
effect,
it
will
be
a
coercive
requirement.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
it
would
have
the
effect
in
the
afdc
recipients
here
providing
them
with
relief
they
want
as
interpreted
by
the
government
in
its
brief.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
until
the
actual
subsequent
statutory
hearing
before
the
state
agency.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
that's
correct.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
the
situation
now
is
that
the
regulation
is
not
effective.
the
states
must
not
--
it's
not
coercive
until
july
1,
19
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
the
situation
as
far
as
federal
matching
money
is
concerned
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
it's
both,
that
the
state
can
do
it
either
way
but
it's
soon
to
be
stated
quite
under
to
the
in
that
--
the
matching
formula
provides
for
continuation
of
payments
for
federal
funds
for
continuation.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
up
to
the
fair
hearing,
regardless
when
a
fair
hearing
is
held
by
the
way.
regardless
of
the
hew
time
limits
also
the
matching
formulas
does
provide
90
days
for
the
local
agency
to
investigate,
decide
and
implement
a
decision
of
ineligibility.
90
days
is
well
--
it
--
within
those
90
days,
the
local
hearing,
the
two
week
hearing
we
talk
of
here.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
it
most
certainly
couldn't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
it
was
mr.
justice
brennan.
although
it
was
promulgated
actually
in
final
form
in
january
1969,
during
the
transition,
i
think
fair
to
say
with
concurrence
of
both
administrations
but
the
postponement
is
of
this
administration.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
harlan.
it
would
not
resolve
the
issue
in
the
home
relief
program.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
discussing
the
procedures
that
had
been
added
since
this
case
was
or
the
administrative
changes
since
this
case
was
before
the
district
court
in
--
between
january
and
june
1968,
it
is
well,
i
think
to
look
at
briefly
the
situation,
the
procedures
used
for
the
terminations
of
the
20
appellees,
not
each
one,
individually
of
course
in
this
very
case.
each
of
them
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
those
i
think
are
the
situations
mr.
justice
white
that
present
the
typical
issues
of
a
contested
termination.
that
is
to
say
the
typical
kind
of
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
those
are
certainly
the
people
who
still
--
who
--
but
for
this
lawsuit
and
the
injunction
below
are
faced
with
the
same
kinds
of
termination
problems
that
they
already
experienced.
many
of
them
were
restored
to
aid
solely
by
virtue
of
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
mr.
justice
white,
some
of
the
interveners
in
this
suit
were
actually
terminated
under
the
new
york
change,
that
is
the
option
b
procedure
the
city
wishes
to
reinstate
by
virtue
of
this
appeal.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white.
others
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i
think
mr.
justice
white,
all
of
them
present
the
kinds
of
that
the
--
and
because
they
continue
to
receive
welfare
benefits
and
therefore
are
confronted
with
the
same
kinds
of
issues
of
termination
or
unlikely
to
be
confronted
with
such
issues
very
similar
to
a
kind
of
union
employer
continuing
relationship,
one
strike
being
settled
doesn't
necessarily
solve
all
the
legal
problems
for
the
future.
i
think
that
the
--
we're
really
confronted
with
all
those
cases
of
the
people
who
still
continue
to
receive
benefits
who
still
are
involved
in
this
case,
work
relationship.
the
terminations
of
the
appellees,
i
think
can
be
grouped
briefly
and
to
several
categories.
it's
important
to
note
that
all
of
them
had
a
conference
or
interview
with
their
caseworker
before
termination.
indeed,
that
interview
which
is
part
of
--
which
is
long
been
required
for
the
periodic
recertification
of
eligibility
in
new
york
and
most
other
states,
all
other
states
was
actually
the
cause
of
termination
in
many
of
this
cases.
for
example,
appellee
john
kelly,
a
new
york
peevee
terminated
because
during
that
interview,
they
had
a
dispute
with
the
caseworker
about
where
they
should
live.
as
a
result
of
their
disagreement
with
the
caseworker
over
where
they
should
live
that
they
were
terminated.
two
weeks
before
angela
velez
who
has
discussed
the
opinion
of
judge
feinberg
below,
before
she
was
terminated,
she
had
an
argument
with
her
caseworker
over
an
extraneous
matter,
over
a
special
grant
and
she
asked,
actually
asked
the
caseworker
to
leave
the
home.
two
weeks
later,
she
received
the
notice
of
termination
informing
her
i
should
say,
she
was
terminated
for
concealment
of
assets,
nothing
further.
during
a
hearing
subsequently
it
was
found
out
that
refer
to
a
landlady's
report
to
the
caseworker
that
her
husband
had
returned
home.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
mr.
justice
stewart
all
the
procedures
except
for
--
well,
some
of
them
have
taken
place
under
all
the
procedures
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
these
particular
ones,
there
was
no
option
b.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
and
that
opportunity
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
but
mr.
justice
stewart
all
--
the
process
that
has
been
described
by
the
city
--
the
city
does
not
rely
on
option
b
as
a
particularly
important
element.
i
don't
think
in
that
process,
they
rely
on
the
whole
process.
i'm
merely
trying
to
establish
mr.
justice
stewart
that
there
was
a
certainty
--
the
caseworker
interview
and
the
unit
supervisor
approval,
the
consultation
with
the
unit
supervisor
that
mr.
loflin
has
mentioned
long
before
option
b
was
added,
option
b
provides
one
further
step.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
that
one
--
that
several
of
the
appellees
did
invoke
in
this
case,
for
example,
one
of
the
appellees
antonio
sotto
was
terminated
for
he
received
a
notice
informing
him
failure
to
attend
rehabilitation
coc,
and
i
should
say
your
honors
that
that
notice
meant
as
much
to
him
at
that
point
as
it
may
mean
to
you
now.
he
did
not
know
what
rehabilitation
coc
was.
it
turns
out
upon
investigation
that
the
caseworker
believed
that
he
was
taking
drugs
and
they
had
a
dispute
over
that
and
she
wanted
him
to
attend
some
particular
rehabilitation
center.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
the
basis
i
think
for
the
ambiguity
is
the
fact
that
we're
dealing
with
formed
notices
issued
by
caseworkers
with
very,
very
heavy
caseloads
and
this
is
to
be
sure
an
assembly
line
type
of
operation
in
that
regard.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
well,
in
fact
in
his
particular
case,
he
unlike
most
welfare
recipients
did
have
an
attorney
to
assist
them
mr.
chief
justice
and
his
attorney
found
out
the
case
unit
to
find
out
some
information.
that's
reflected
in
the
record
and
his
attorney,
mr.
greenberg,
has
written
an
affidavit
that's
in
this
record.
the
information
wasn't
very
helpful.
he,
unlike
most
recipients
received
a
copy
of
the
review
decision
under
this
option
b
which
judge
feinberg
refers
to
in
his
opinion
below
and
the
review
decision
by
the
case
supervisor,
this
neutral
official
states
that
mr.
sotto
was
terminated
because
he
was
a
parricide,
because
he
was
playing
a
game.
i'm
quoting
from
that
decision
and
which
is
also
printed
in
the
record
mr.
chief
justice.
as
to
the
facts
involved,
mr.
sotto
has
never
yet
learned
just
what
this
dispute
was
about
nor
has
his
attorney
mr.
greenberg.
upon
intervention
in
this
lawsuit,
the
city
dropped
the
term
“parricide
and
playing
a
game”
and
restart
them
to
the
roles.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
his
restoration
probably
was
retroactive
mr.
chief
justice
but
i'm
not
clear
on
that.
certainly
from
july
1,
1968,
upon
subsequent
vindications
in
the
subsequent
fair
hearing,
the
payments
themselves
are
retroactive.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
his
benefits
were
not
terminated
for
any
length
of
time
because
he
was
--
he
did
intervene
in
this
lawsuit
soon
afterwards.
i
think
in
terms
of
your
question,
i
think
one
--
if
one
looked
at
the
cases
such
as
--
there
are
few
interveners
here.
the
harms
in
this
case
were
minimized
for
most
of
the
appellees
by
virtue
of
this
lawsuit.
there
were
a
few
however
who
came
into
this
lawsuit,
who
came
to
attorneys,
late
in
the
process
of
termination
while
they
were
awaiting
the
fair
hearing
as
in
the
case
of
(inaudible)
and
angela
velez.
in
their
particular
cases,
as
this
record
makes
clear,
they
suffered
eviction,
living
in
one
room
with
four
children
in
a
sister's
overcrowded
apartment,
living
on
handouts,
attending
harlem
hospital
for
treatment
of
dysentery.
mrs.
(inaudible)
in
the
welfare
center
while
waiting
for
an
emergency
grant
for
food.
the
retroactive
payments
based
on
the
amount
of
money
that
she
would
have
received
had
the
case
--
had
this
not
been
--
had
there
been
deliberation
before
termination.
had
there
been
an
examination
of
this
decision
that
she
contested
from
the
outset
surely
cannot
in
any
way
be
commensurate
or
in
any
way
repair
ameliorate
those
kinds
of
indignities,
those
kinds
of
harms
and
of
course
no
one
is
entitled
to
damages
for
those
kinds
of
injuries.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
a
--
it
most
certainly
is.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
it
most
certainly
is
mr.
chief
justice.
the
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
he
was
vindicated
after
this
procedure
was
passed
in
the
fair
hearing.
he
is
still
or
she,
i
should
say
and
most
of
these
appellees
are
still
receiving
welfare
benefits
and
still
face
the
procedures
that
are
to
be
used
in
regard
to
a
termination
of
those
benefits.
indeed
some
of
the
termination
issues
in
regard
to
some
of
the
appellees,
he
was
never
even
resolved
the
city
just
because
of
this
lawsuit
finding
these
people
as
something
different
because
of
this
lawsuit
dropped
the
matter
of
termination.
we
think
that
the
--
were
the
--
they're
not
in
these
lawsuits,
they
are
faced
with
that
ever
present
danger
and
of
course
they
do
represent
the
class
of
individuals
very
similarly
situated.
our
legal
argument
is
based
essentially
on
three
prepositions.
the
first
is
that
the
due
process
guarantees
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
against
government
arbitrariness
and
capriciousness
apply
to
the
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
no.
the
due
process
--
the
guarantee
that
no
person
shall
be
deprived
of
life,
liberty,
or
property
without
due
process
of
law,
that
guarantee
we
submit
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
without
due
process
of
law,
without
the
proceedings
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
no,
mr.
justice
black.
we're
not
relying
on
notions
of
reasonableness
or
arbitrariness
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
with
--
we're
relying
on
the
well-established
obligation
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
we
think
that
the
procedural
aspect
of
due
process
is
not
--
does
not
permit
the
latitude
or
leave
the
justices
at
bay
in
the
sense
that
substantive
due
process
may
be
said
to.
we're
talking
about
those
procedures
which
this
court
time
and
time
again
has
deemed
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
we
--
i
mean
notice
and
the
elements
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i
think
due
process,
its
well
accepted
mr.
justice
black
but
due
process
refers
to
a
adversary
proceeding
proceeded
by
notice.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
there
may
be
some
question
as
to
what
context,
what
it
requires
in
certain
context
but
i
think
the
point
here
is
that
it's
conceded
mr.
justice
black
that
the
due
process
guarantees
against
our
government
arbitrariness
and
capriciousness
apply
to
public
assistance
programs.
that's
not
really
an
issue
here.
none
of
the
parties
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
nor
is
it
an
issue
--
certainly
its
not
an
issue
in
the
government's
view
also
in
its
memorandum
and
nor
i
think
properly
viewed
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
certainly
not
mr.
justice
white
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
established
that
preposition
de
novo
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i
think
--
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
say
why
it
does,
no
question,
i
do.
and
i'd
like
to
briefly
address
myself
to
why
that
concession
is
well
founded.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i
think
one
has
to
make
some
certain
distinctions
mr.
justice
black.
if
you're
talking
about
an
emergency
handout
program
in
a
period
of
disaster
or
if
we're
talking
about
the
19th
century
pattern
of
relief,
the
19th
century
distribution
of
benefits,
private
or
public
for
which
there
was
very
little
distinction,
i
think
it's
quite
different
from
the
kinds
of
programs
we're
dealing
with
here.
concededly
these
programs
establish
a
statutory
entitlement
for
all
eligible
individuals.
concededly
that
entitlement
cannot
be
denied
or
revoked
i
should
say
without
an
administrative
finding
that
the
person
is
no
longer
eligible.
concededly,
eligibility
--
that
finding
must
be
supported
by
evidence.
concededly
where
a
caseworker
to
merely
terminate
a
person
because
i
don't
like
--
because
he
didn't
like
the
color
of
his
hair
for
example,
that
would
be
arbitrary
administrative
action
under
these
programs
and
unconstitutional,
that
would
be
a
denial
of
due
process.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
mr.
justice
black
i
think
it's
very
important
that
--
we
recognize
we're
not
dealing
with
the
kind
of
program
that
you've
mentioned
regarding
the
civil
war.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
not
at
all.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i
think
the
question
of
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
certainly
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
left
off
before
the
lunch
time,
recess
on
the
threshold
and
fundamental
question
of
whether
the
due
process
procedural
guarantees
apply
to
public
assistance
benefits
at
all.
if
one
looks
to
the
nature
of
the
factors
that
this
court
has
traditionally
deemed
relevant,
the
nature
of
the
individual
interest,
the
nature
of
the
government
interest,
the
burden
on
the
program
or
proceedings,
one
finds
that
all
of
those
factors
compel
one
answer.
the
nature
of
the
individual
interest
is
what's
examined
is
in
a
statutory
entitlement
of
enormous
value
to
the
beholders,
a
statutory
entitlement
on
which
the
very
quality
of
life
depends.
this
record
makes
very
clear
the
consequences
of
erroneous
withdrawal
of
that
entitlement.
it
is
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i
think
that
factor
of
gravity
of
harm
mr.
justice
white
is
reflected
in
for
example
the
deportation
of
alien
cases
in
which
the
agency
is
held
to
the
highest
degree
of
procedural
safeguards
before
an
alien
may
be
deported
though
he
has
no
vested
right
to
remain
here.
but
because
as
this
court
once
said,
deportation
may
deprive
one
of
all
that
makes
life
worth
living.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
fleming
and
nestor
refers
to
--
the
question
in
fleming
--
fleming
and
nestor
is
support
for
our
proposition.
it
certainly
said
that
the
statutory
entitlement
under
oasdi
is
within
the
due
process
guarantees
against
arbitrariness
and
capriciousness.
it
only
went
on
to
say
an
issue
not
involved
here,
whether
it's
vested
in
all
circumstances
or
other
circumstances
where
it's
not
vested.
we
are
not
arguing
with
the
substantive
grounds
but
they're
relevant
to
the
procedures.
we're
not
arguing
with
the
substantive
grounds
of
revocation
whatsoever
nor
are
we
arguing
with
congress'
power
or
the
state's
power
to
answer
those
grounds
or
indeed
--
to
use
an
extreme
example
to
do
away
with
these
programs.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
programs
exist.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
it
certainly
could
mr.
justice
stewart
except
for
the
--
what
we
do,
except
for
the
fact
that
we
have
figures
in
this
record
and
no
one
really
argues
about
them
at
the
rate
of
administrative
error
in
denying
or
terminating
aid
is
enormous.
the
rate
reflect
on
the
face
of
case
records.
this
only
is
the
caseworker's
version
of
why
she
terminated
it
which
is
meant
to
obviously
reflect
a
proper
version
to
sustain
the
decision
so
to
speak.
the
national
rate
there
is
between
6%
and
7%
on
the
face
of
the
case
record
of
erroneous
terminations.
the
figures
upon
the
reversals
in
those
hearings
and
in
particular
on
the
prior
hearings,
range
from
at
least
25%
to
up
to
51%
in
new
york
city
today.
it
can't
be
said
that
the
contested
decision
is
to
terminate.
we
agree
that
people
come
on
welfare
in
periods
of
temporary
crisis
and
they
go
off
welfare.
and
usually
most
terminations
are
by
agreement
with
caseworker.
those
we
have
no
concern
with.
our
concern
is
with
those
in
which
the
recipient
disagrees
with
the
caseworker
and
wishes
to
contest
that
caseworker's
decision.
in
that
narrow
group
of
cases,
we
find
that
the
times
in
which
the
recipient
as
opposed
to
the
caseworker
is
correct
is
enormous,
the
rate
of
error
is
just
startling,
it's
singular
i
think
in
the
government
benefit
program.
nonetheless,
these
decisions
are
not
vindicated
in
subsequent
fair
hearings
for
a
variety
of
reasons
not
the
least
of
which
is
that
the
overwhelming
impact,
the
interim
deprivations
and
equally
important
the
fact
that
the
timing
of
the
hearing
is
wholly
in
the
hands
of
the
government
is
not
without
significance
here.
no
one
really
argues
that
the
hew
60
day
rule
now
enforce
for
several
years
is
anything
but
theoretical.
the
period
reflected
in
this
case
and
still
reflected
in
new
york
range
from
anything
from
4
months
to
as
much
as
8
months.
we're
not
using
used
examples.
but
for
4
months
to
8
months
or
even
60
days
mr.
justice
stewart
to
go
without
the
very
subsistence,
food,
for
clothing,
shelter
and
money
for
--
i'm
sorry
your
honors,
money
for
food,
clothing
and
shelter
does
not
leave
one
in
any
positions
--
engaged
in
a
legal
wrangle
with
the
welfare
department.
we
don't
know
what
happens
to
those
people.
the
mystery
though
is
by
no
means
reassuring.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
mr.
justice
marshall,
there's
nothing
one
can
do
about
the
systematic
sustained
delay
in
the
fair
hearing
process.
indeed
the
attempts
to
retain
civil
relief
in
the
new
york
courts
is
met
with
the
answer
that
this
is
directory.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
they
didn't
have
money
to
process
their
appeal.
there
isn't
a
cost
in
processing
the
appeal.
they
didn't
have
the
wherewithal,
they
didn't
have
the
weight,
they
were
concerned
with
the
problems
of
daily
living
and
survival,
the
eviction
and
the
like
which
accounts
for
this
kind
of
low
rate.
it
certainly
isn't
in
the
timing
of
the
hearing,
the
fact
or
significance
in
the
timing,
it
is
not
the
practicalities
of
the
situation,
that
is
the
kind
of
hearing
involved,
the
number
of
issues
or
witnesses
that
account
for
a
delay.
as
we
well
know,
welfare
termination
hearings
unlike
most
administrative
proceedings
of
this
court
deals
with
--
involved
one
or
two
issues
at
most
one
outside
source
of
information
or
to
take
utmost
a
half
to
1
one
hour.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
how
--
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
those
one
and
two
issues
fall
into
several
categories.
one
is,
the
landlady
said
that
her
husband
has
returned
home.
the
board
of
education
says
she's
working
for
her
now.
just
to
use
the
instant
cases,
which
aren't
too
typical
or
the
caseworker
says
you
haven't
co-operated
properly.
you
haven't
permitted
to
see
this.
you
haven't
cooperated
in
bringing
your
missing
husband
to
heal.
and
these
are
all
evaluative
judgments
that
the
–
under
very
vague
standards
which
arise
from
this
very
personal
relationship
and
very
singular
to
welfare,
i
should
say,
between
a
caseworker
and
a
recipient.
that
relationship
being
imbued
with
notions
of
warship
treatment,
rehabilitation
as
well
as
the
pleasing
function
of
eligibility.
those
are
the
typical
issues
in
contested
terminations.
and
we
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
one
cannot
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
he
gets
an
average
grant
mr.
justice
black
for
approximately
$60
to
65$
a
month,
somewhat
less
for
children.
and
that
is
to
take
care
of
all
--
plus
rent,
i'm
sorry,
plus
rent.
that
has
taken
all
his
non-rent
needs,
rent
is
paid
within
certain
limits
as
it's
actually
incur
and
nothing
more.
there's
no
question
that
the
level
of
aid
is
penurious
an
to
an
extreme.
the
resource
policy
requiring
you
to
yield
resources
when
you're
found
eligible
and
to
continue
to
yield
resources
to
the
welfare
department
afterwards
ensures
that
you
cannot
budget
for
any
contingency
including
administrative
error.
it
is
not
though
the
practicalities
that
protract
the
hearing
process,
that's
revealed
in
the
fact
that
in
those
states
in
which
prior
hearings
are
now
afforded.
the
pattern
of
timing
is
from
one
to
two
weeks
and
that's
really
what
we're
talking
about
when
we
looked
to
the
so-called
cost
of
the
extra
costs
or
the
burdens
on
the
system
which
has
certainly
been
a
relevant
--
is
a
relevant
factor.
we
do
not
argue
the
constitution
requires
the
impractical
or
the
impossible.
there
is
neither
of
that
here.
nor
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i
certainly
did
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
there
are
approximately
four
or
five
pursuant
to
court
orders
who
are
agreements,
stipulations
during
the
course
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
new
york
state
is
the
best
example
of
that.
in
new
york
state,
new
york
city
in
particular,
it
is
the
largest
welfare
department
in
the
country
including
any
state
welfare
department
i
should
add.
but
the
largest
number
of
recipients
presumably
relatively
more
sophisticated
recipients,
relatively
greater
access
to
legal
assistance
to
--
so
it
provides
a
good
test
case
for
the
notion
of
what
kind
of
burden
this
will
incur.
the
burden
that
incurs,
one
or
evidence
in
the
fact
that
new
york
state
which
shares
half
of
these
costs
is
not
here
today.
the
burden
that
incurs
is
more
better
revealed
in
the
fact
that
out
of
60,000
terminations
and
of
course
the
five
months
in
new
york
city,
there
were
1,000
prior
hearings
requested
out
of
which
51%
were
the
recipient
prevailed.
even
under
the
government's
test
in
its
memorandum
of
whether
more
eligible
than
ineligible
people
request
these
hearings,
we
would
prevail
in
this
case.
the
city
--
in
comparing
also
those
additional
costs
for
the
one
or
two
weeks
and
after
all
the
only
--
we
believe
permissible
additional
costs
that
can
be
considered
here
are
those
that
are
ultimately
one
or
two
week
payments
to
people
who
are
ultimately
found
ineligible.
in
comparing
that,
one
must
also
look
to
the
kind
of
cumbersome
procedure
that
new
york
city
seems
to
offer.
we
would
say
it's
totally
an
effective
one,
the
written
review
type
thing
and
all
these
supervisors
talking
to
each
other.
but
that
certainly
must
cost
and
take
time
too.
the
entire
operation
in
new
york
city
with
10,000
closings
a
month
entails
six
review
officers.
now,
i
will
grant
you
compared
to
the
state
fair
hearing
process
which
only
has
ten
altogether
for
the
entire
state,
that's
quite
a
few.
but
in
terms
of
actual
monetary
burdens
on
the
system,
six
review
officers,
we
submit
in
a
welfare
department
with
a
budget
of
the
city
of
new
york
such
as
it
has,
is
de
minimis,
its
just
not
a
factor
that
really
can
be
accounted
for.
we
also
would
ask
this
court
to
recognize
in
looking
at
the
burdens
or
non-burdens
that
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
effect
of
the
present
procedure
of
postponing
and
seriously
postponing
the
fair
hearing
is
to
deter
and
discourage
its
use
to
the
extent
that
prior
hearings
will
be
used
more
as
a
result
of
removing
this
deterrence.
we
don't
think
those
are
appropriate
costs
for
the
simple
reason
we
think
if
any
policy
of
deliberately
forestalling
a
constitutional
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
order
to
discourage
its
use
regardless
of
the
merits
of
the
claims,
we
think
would
be
impermissible,
the
right
to
be
heard
and
must
be
more
than
a
theoretical
or
a
nominal
one.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
the
federal
government
isn't
talking
about
a
hearing
mr.
justice
white
when
it
talks
about
the
advanced
notice
of
questions.
it
talks
about
a
caseworker
which
has
been
done
for
a
long
time,
it's
really
nothing
new,
tells
a
recipient
--
involves
the
recipient
in
the
re-determination
process.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
we're
talk
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
absolutely
not
mr.
justice
white.
we're
talking
about
the
absolute
rudiments
of
an
adversary
proceeding
where
the
recipient
requests
it.
by
that
we
mean,
only
that
the
caseworker
presents
the
case
to
a
relatively
uninvolved
official,
the
recipient
hears
the
case,
after
all
that's
the
first
opportunity
the
recipient
has
to
learn
of
the
cases
at
this
hearing,
those
cryptic
notices
will
not
reveal
the
case.
has
an
opportunity
to
hear
the
evidence
and
question
the
caseworker
of
course
and
those
are
facts
about
the
recipient,
functionally,
those
are
facts
very
intimately
about
that
particular
person
and
obviously
our
--
the
assumption
of
our
system
is
that
that
person
is
in
the
best
position
to
refute
them
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
where
there
is
--
where
the
termination,
which
is
not
all
the
cases
mr.
justice
white
rest
entirely
on
third
party
information,
the
landlady
said
“blank.”
mr.
lee
a.
albert
or
in
part,
well,
alright,
or
in
part
and
not
substantiated
by
other
documentary
evidence
that
say
to
third
parties.
yes,
in
that
case
where
the
credibility
of
those
witnesses
is
called
into
question,
we
say
those
witnesses
have
to
be
there
so
that
the
recipient
can
question
and
there
is
no
way
to
rebut
anonymous
accusations.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
in
cases
it
said,
“where
the
veracity
--
where
the
evidence
depends
on
the
veracity
or
credibility
of
third
parties.”
mr.
lee
a.
albert
and
critical
to
the
case,
yes.
mr.
justice
white,
we're
not
asking
to
spell
out
a
code
of
welfare
procedure.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
this
--
well,
this
issue
really
is
not
involved
in
this
case
there's
not
one
of
the
appellees
who
raisethe
question
of
law.
we
are
not
arguing
now,
lets
be
clear,
we
are
not
--
to
use
the
government's
example
that
--
we're
not
arguing
that
where
there's
across
the
board
reduction
by
the
legislature
or
the
regulation,
in
those
--
and
the
validity
of
that
reduction
is
being
challenged
as
a
legal
matter.
in
those
situations
you're
entitled
to
prior
hearings.
we
agree
that
questions
of
statutory
validity
or
constitutional
validity
are
much
more
appropriate
for
the
judicial
process
than
for
administrative
hearings.
administrative
agencies
don't
have
the
power
to
resolve
those
questions.
we're
not
talking
about
that.
the
application
of
regulations
as
in
the
case
of
mrs.
guzman
for
example,
we
are
including
of
course,
that's
where
the
caseworkers
states
that
she
thinks
there's
a
policy
of
this
kind
of
cooperation,
the
recipient
states
that
there's
no
such
policy,
certainly
the
policy
is
based
on
whether
there
are
justifiable
reasons
not
to
participate
in
this
lawsuit.
the
department
recognizes
that
and
that
kind
of
a
situation,
that's
an
application
of
a
regulation
in
the
evaluative
regulation
at
that.
we
submit
that
that
requires
the
hearing
but
not
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
certainly
as
far
as
the
due
process
clause
in
the
constitution
is
concerned,
we
are
not
asking
for
two
hearings,
we
are
not
asking
for
appeals,
we
don't
care
if
the
hearing
examiner
salary
is
paid
by
the
city
or
the
state.
we
think
there
are
different
view
points
on
that
as
indicated
in
the
state
commissioner's
view
point
and
hew's
--
perhaps
hew
view
point.
those
are
considerations
that
really
have
little
to
do
with
the
due
process
clause.
we're
only
asking
for
one
constitutionally
adequate
opportunity
to
be
heard
at
a
meaningful
time,
at
a
time
when
recipients
can
use
that
at
a
time
when
the
remedy
can
be
effective,
that
is
to
say
one
when
it
can
provide
relief
against
the
kinds
of
harms
that
are
reflected
in
this
record.
we
think
that
one
thing
that
has
been
left
out
that
should
be
stressed
here
is
that
a
good
part
of
the
reason
for
due
process
procedural
guarantees
is
because
government
arbitrariness
regardless
of
the
context
is
still
government
arbitrariness
and
therefore
unconstitutional.
we
think
that
the
dangers
of
arbitrariness
in
this
system
are
about
as
great
as
any
administrative
program
one
can
think
of.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
absolutely
not,
first
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
well,
for
factors
one
observed
in
cafeteria
workers
against
mcelroy,
the
government
engaged
in
a
managerial
function
as
employer
to
the
discretionary
kinds
of
decisions
which
are
slightly
different
and
three,
the
question
of
a
suspension
of
an
employee
may
well
fall
into
one
of
those
extraordinary
situations
laid
out
by
this
court
where
for
example,
the
employee
represents
some
immediate
threat
to
the
service
or
the
department.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
there
might
be
at
least
the
requirement
of
--
as
indeed,
there's
the
practice
in
the
federal
civil
service
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i
don't
--
but
i
think
an
important
--
i
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
white.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
we
are
not
litigating
a
variety
of
government
benefit
programs
or
government
employment
which
involves
factors
that
are
very
different
than
the
ones
here.
there
are
many
benefit
programs
that
provide
for
benefits
to
continue
after
eligibility
is
ceased,
social
security,
oasdi
and
disability.
the
one
area
where
there
might
be
dispute
is
one
of
those
programs,
civil
service
mentions
another.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i'm
sorry.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
it's
correct
mr.
justice
harlan.
that
was
promulgated
a
year
ago
by
hew.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
ithink
it
verifies
that
the
fair
hearing
requirement
of
the
federal
act
which
after
all
does
import
notions
of
due
process
into
it
cannot
be
truly
effective
unless
the
hearing
is
prior.
and
that's
what
hew
said
when
it
promulgated
the
regulation.
it
has
been
postponed
mr.
justice
harlan
till
next
july
over
opposition,
over
a
variety
of
oppositions.
some
like
new
york
which
prefers
the
local
agency
hearings.
some
states
just
don't
like
federal
encouragence,
additional
procedural
impositions
under
hew's
power.
we
think
the
relevance
is
that
it
represents
the
judgment
of
the
administrative
agency
charged
knowing
something
about
these
matters
that
that
is
required
and
that
still
current
federal
policy
although
not
presently
not
–
it's
effective
data
is
postponed.
it's
still
part
of
the
federal
regulations
as
is
the
federal
matching
formulas
to
encourage
states
to
continue
aid.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
it's
still
supposed
to
be
a
requirement
of
that
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
if
it
--
if
and
when
it
goes
into
effect,
it
will
be
a
coercive
requirement.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
it
would
have
the
effect
in
the
afdc
recipients
here
providing
them
with
relief
they
want
as
interpreted
by
the
government
in
its
brief.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
until
the
actual
subsequent
statutory
hearing
before
the
state
agency.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
that's
correct.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
the
situation
now
is
that
the
regulation
is
not
effective.
the
states
must
not
--
it's
not
coercive
until
july
1,
19
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
the
situation
as
far
as
federal
matching
money
is
concerned
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
it's
both,
that
the
state
can
do
it
either
way
but
it's
soon
to
be
stated
quite
under
to
the
in
that
--
the
matching
formula
provides
for
continuation
of
payments
for
federal
funds
for
continuation.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
up
to
the
fair
hearing,
regardless
when
a
fair
hearing
is
held
by
the
way.
regardless
of
the
hew
time
limits
also
the
matching
formulas
does
provide
90
days
for
the
local
agency
to
investigate,
decide
and
implement
a
decision
of
ineligibility.
90
days
is
well
--
it
--
within
those
90
days,
the
local
hearing,
the
two
week
hearing
we
talk
of
here.
mr.

a.
albert
it
most
certainly
couldn't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
it
was
mr.
justice
brennan.
although
it
was
promulgated
actually

1969,
during
the
transition,
i
think
fair

say
with
concurrence
of
both
administrations
but
the
postponement
is
of
this
administration.
mr.
lee

albert

is
correct
mr.
justice
harlan.
it
would
not
resolve
the
issue
in
the
home
relief
program.
