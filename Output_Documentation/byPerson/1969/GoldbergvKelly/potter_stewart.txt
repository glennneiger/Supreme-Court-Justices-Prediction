justice

is
there
any
way
of
knowing
how
long
that
time
is
on
the
average

in
the
typical
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
50

justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
gather
mr.
loflin
that
like
california,
the
city
also
concedes
that
constitutionally
there
is
some
obligation
of
some
form
of
due
process
before
termination
may
be
made.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
state
actual
city
procedure?
justice

were
this
under
the

were
this
action
taken
out
on
the
procedures
that
are
now
before
us?
justice

justice

(voice

my
brother
white's
question
and
what's
before
us
now
is
option
b
as
part
and
parcel
of
a
whole
procedural
process
that's
been
described
by
counsel
for
the
city,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me,
you
finish.
justice
potter
stewart
it
just
occurred
to
me
that
the
deportation
process
is
final
and
they're
irrevocable
so
far
as
the
administrative
process
goes,
whereas,
this
is
not,
this
is
subject
to
a
so-called
fair
hearing
review
in
which
as
i
understand
it,
you
concede
all
of
the
due
process
qualities
that
you're
asserting
are
necessary
are
in
fact
accorded.
i
think
it's
very
important
in
looking
to
that
to
recognize
that
the
subsequent
fair
hearing
in
the
light
of
these
circumstances
is
largely
an
illusory
and
certainly
an
ineffective
remedy.
i
think
this
is
one
of
those
situations
not
dissimilar
to
sniadach
in
this
respect
that
the
delay
in
relief,
the
operative,
putting
the
decision
into
operation
before
an
opportunity
to
contest
it
all
but
precludes
the
opportunity
to
contest.
if
one
looks
to
the
fair
hearing
figures,
over
a
course
of
years
on
termination,
they're
not
reflected
in
the
6,000
hearings
that
were
talked
about
by
california.
they're
not
reflected
in
the
many
more
hearings
talked
about
by
new
york.
they're
talked
--
they're
reflected
in
figures
amounting
in
many
states
to
zero
out
of
thousands
and
thousands
of
terminations.
in
new
york
they
amount
to
the
subsequent
fair
hearing
approximately
50
a
month
from
the
city
of
new
york
out
of
10,000
terminations
and
about
a
lesser
number
from
upstate.
justice
potter
stewart
of

that
could
lead
to
quite
a
different
inference

it?
it
could
lead
to
an
inference
that
people
are
terminated
with
the
exception
of
only
about
50
a
month
only
when
its
very
clear
that
they
should
be
terminated
and
if
they're

as
only
a

50
a

there's
any
real

justice

stewart
mr.
albert,
you
said
that
hew
regulation,
its

date

i
take

could
rescind
tomorrow,

they?
