justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
what
you
consider
due
process
notice
as
--
is
what
you're
talking
about
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
your
idea
of
due
process
is
that
the
caseworker
calls
the
person
and
just
two
of
them
in
the
room
and
he
gives
them
notice
and
that's
the
type
of
notice
that
still
process
notice?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
is
that
a
due
process
notice
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
does
that
fit
with
the
constitution
of
your
idea
of
what
due
process
is?
do
you
want
to
call
this
due
process
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
it
similar
to?
or
do
you
say
if
something
as
peculiar
to
welfare?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
any
other
cases
that
you
could
cite
to,
other
than
a
welfare
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
do
you
see
any
difference
between
a
government
employee
making
20
thousand
a
year
and
a
welfare
worker
as
to
be
--
in
able
to
live
doing
this
due
process
period?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
wouldn't
you
then
be
inclined
to
give
them
some
due
process?
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
idea
of
due
process
is
that
the
caseworker
that's
investigated
it
and
has
made
up
his
or
her
mind
that
this
recipient
doesn't
deserve
it
anymore
calls
him
in
and
gives
him
a
notice
and
hearing
and
the
termination,
that's
your
idea
of
due
process?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who
investigated
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
wouldn't
the
caseworker
asked
him
to
come
in
if
the
caseworker
hadn't
thought
that
there
was
bare
possibility
that
perhaps
the
recipient
might
be
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
a
personal
conference
is
nothing
close
to
a
due
process
hearing,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
your
idea
of
fairness?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
the
supervisor
says,
“it's
alright”?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
when?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
your
idea
of
due
process?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
noticed
in
this
notice
of
decision,
it
says,
“if
you
were
to
satisfy
this
decision,
you
may
request
a
fair
hearing
in
capital
in
writing
or
orally.”
is
that
word
fair
hearing
declared
in
the
state
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
if
you
used
that
term
and
does
it
define
what
it
mean?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
that?
i'd
like
to
see
just
what
statutory
thing
we're
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
there's
no
definition
of
it
in
the
state
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
it
in
the
state
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you're
not
talking
about
judgment
now,
what
does
the
statute
make
a
fair
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
statute
require
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
defines
that
as
a
part
of
a
fair
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
mr.
loflin
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
there
in

york
statute
that
says
that
you
shall
have
a
fair
hearing
in
certain
cases?
justice
thurgood
marshall
certain
--
isn't
there
a
statute
that
says
just
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
think
mr.
justice
black
had.
do
you
have
citations
of
that
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
voluntary
legal
aid
program
in
new
york?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
with
your
point
that
they
didn't
have
money
enough
to
process
their
appeal,
that
was
all
i
was
(voice
