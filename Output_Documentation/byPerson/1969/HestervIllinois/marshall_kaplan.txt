yes
your
honor.
mr.
marshall
kaplan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
this
court
to
review
the
murder
conviction
of
a
14-year
old
fifth
grade
elementary
school
negro
boy
on
the
south
side
of
chicago.
the
confession
that
he
gave
primarily,
being
responsible
for
his
subsequent
conviction
in
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county
illinois
and
his
subsequent
incarceration
for
55
years
in
the
illinois
state
penitentiary.
on
april
20,
1961
at
4
o'clock
in
the
afternoon,
the
body
of
a
school
teacher
in
the
lewis
champlain
elementary
school
on
the
south
side
of
chicago
illinois
was
found,
she
was
dead.
she
had
been
stabbed
numerous
times
and
it
appeared
that
she
had
been
sexually
molested.
16
hours
after
her
body
was
found,
lee
arthur
hester
was
removed
from
his
school
room
at
the
lewis
champlain
school
which
would
put
it
at
approximately
8
o'clock
am.
from
8
o'clock
am
on
april
21,
a
friday
1961
to
the
minute
i
stand
before
you,
lee
arthur
hester
has
been
incarcerated.
most
of
the
time
at
the
illinois
state
penitentiary,
part
of
the
time
in
the
cook
county
jail
and
some
other
time
in
the
audi
home,
the
juvenile
detention
home
in
chicago
illinois.
the
school
where
lee
arthur
hester
attended
had
approximately
2,600
students
attending
in
double
shifts.
hester
going
from
8
to
12
in
the
morning
and
another
group
going
from
12
to
approximately
3
or
4
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
on
the
same
grounds
of
this
school
was
a
high
school
called
the
englewood
high
school
just
separated
a
little
distance
away
through
a
courtyard
or
field
and
that
had
2,000
students
approximately
and
then
there
was
a
continuation
school.
a
school
in
chicago
which
houses
and
teaches
older
students
who
drop
out
of
school
who
because
the
state
law
are
required
to
attend
school
until
a
certain
age,
16
or
17
years
of
age.
two
police
officers
came
to
hester's
room
shortly
before
8
o'clock
a.m.
in
a
company
of
a
gym
teacher,
who
had
stated
to
the
officers
that
she
had
seen
hester
in
the
hall,
sometime
the
day
before,
and
i
believe
she
said
she
saw
him
running.
the
officers
rummaged
through
the
records
of
the
teacher
that
--
in
whose
room,
hester
was
a
student.
when
the
teacher
came
to
the
room,
they
told
everyone
to
see
lee
arthur.
she
told
this
to
lee
arthur,
she
sent
him
out
of
the
room,
they
kept
him
a
couple
of
minutes,
they
sent
him
back
and
the
teachers
says
--
said
and
she
testified
to
this.
what
--
or
he
testified
to
this.
"what
do
they
want
from
lee
arthur?"
he
says
“they
think
i
killed
mrs.
keen”.
and
the
whole
room
started
to
laugh.
from
that
moment
until
a
confession
was
signed,
sometime
between
8:15
and
8:30
in
the
evening
of
friday,
that
day
was
friday,
april
21,
1961.
lee
arthur
hester
was
in
to
a
continuous
unbroken
custody
of
at
least
7
police
officers
of
the
chicago
police
department
who
kept
hester
from
about
8
o'clock
in
the
morning
until
8:45
a.m.
questioning
him.
those
two
officers,
sheldon
r.
teller
and
another
officer
by
the
name
of
anton
franco
who
then
turned
hester
over
to
another
officer
by
the
name
of
feliz
in
the
principal's
office
who
kept
him
for
approximately
15
minutes,
who
then
turned
hester
over
to
two
other
officers,
robert
perkins
and
an
officer
by
the
name
of
harold
thomas
who
then
took
hester
to
a
police
station
in
the
neighborhood.
they
switched
automobiles
and
they
took
him
to
the
audi
home,
the
juvenile
detention
home.
hester
was
searched
at
the
juvenile
detention
home.
all
of
his
clothing
was
removed
and
from
his
pockets,
all
of
his
belongings
removed
including
and
i
beg
your
honor
to
consider
what
was
removed
from
the
pockets,
marbles.
now
at
this
time,
hester
was
14
years
5
days
of
age.
his
iq
was
either
75
or
82
and
the
reason
that
it
is
either
that
there
are
a
couple
of
test
included
in
the
record
submitted
an
evidence,
one
shows
he
was
75
and
the
other
that
his
iq
was
82.
he
was
one
of
8
children
of
a
ghetto
family.
his
reading
rate
was
approximately
that
of
a
second
grader
in
grammar
school
that
slightly
lower
going
to
the
school
records.
his
mathematics
ability
was
graded
at
approximately
third
grade.
his
school
records
indicate
from
psychological
testing
that
his
maximum,
his
maximum
emotional
growth
was
9
years
of
age
or
as
the
record
show,
4.7
excuse
me,
4
a
grammar
school.
4
a
grammar
school
usually
a
child
of
normal
progression
school
reaches
the
fourth
grade
when
he
is
9
years
old.
in
my
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
i
have
an
error
i
believe
at
page
6
i'm
not
sure.
i
say
that
the
--
i
made
a
mistake
and
said
that
the
maximum
emotional
growth
was
11
years
old.
mr.
justice
underwood
who
wrote
the
majority
opinion
for
the
supreme
court
said
that
the
defendant
had
a
maximum
emotional
growth
or
a
mentality.
we
find
he
had
a
mentality
of
an
11
year
old
although
he
was
qualified
to
give
a
confession.
anyway,
not
to
interrupt
the
chronology
of
what
happened,
at
approximately
4
o'clock
in
the
afternoon,
after
having
been
detained
from
10:30
in
the
morning
until
4:00
in
the
afternoon,
lee
arthur
hester
was
interrogated
by
four
obliged
police
officers.
now,
hester
was
5
feet
one
and
a
half
inches
tall
i
believe,
a
111
and
a
half
inch
--
a
111
and
a
half
pounds.
hester
could
barely
read.
hester
could
barely
compute.
hester
could
barely
understand.
hester
was
not
insane
and
we
admit
it.
not
once
in
the
entire
day
that
he
was
kept
either
in
custody
or
interrogated,
was
he
permitted
to
see
his
mother
whom
he
repeatedly
requested
to
see
“i
want
to
see
my
mama.”
not
once
was
he
permitted
to
see
a
probation
officer.
not
once
was
he
permitted
to
see
his
father
or
lawyer
or
anyone
standing
in
loco
parentis
to
him,
not
once.
every
single
witness
who
testified
for
the
prosecution
testified
that
we
did
not
warn
him
that
he
need
not
make
a
statement.
that
we
did
not
warn
him
that
anything
he
said
could
be
used
against
him.
that
we
did
not
warn
him
he
was
entitled
to
counsel
and
we
did
not
warn
him
if
he
couldn't
afford
counsel,
we
give
him
counsel.
now
i
know
that
those
are
the
four
requirements
of
miranda
versus
arizona.
now,
our
basic
point
today
your
honors
is
that
in
three
ways,
this
confession
must
fall.
the
first
way
that
basically,
specifically
and
unequivocally,
you
cannot
take
a
confession
from
a
person
almost
illiterate.
now
when
he
is
14
years
old,
you
must
couple
that
with
what
we
know
we
cannot
forget
as
lawyers
what
we
know
as
men.
i
believe
justice
frankfurter
once
said
that
and
i
think
it
was
in
kolom
versus
connecticut.
we
can't
forget
that
a
14
year
old
in
the
ghetto
who
can
barely
read
has
no
experience
with
life.
we
cannot
forget
that
a
14
year
old
in
to
custody
of
approximately
7
police
officers
is
no
match
for
these
police
officers.
when
you
couple
that
with
the
fact
that
these
four
police
officers
walked
in
to
a
room
at
4
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
and
testified,
that's
in
the
record
when
my
associate
who
was
sitting
at
that
table
asked
him.
"what
did
you
say
to
lee
arthur
when
you
walked
in?"
"we
introduced
ourselves."
"and
how
long
did
you
stay?"
"five
minutes."
and
after
five
minutes,
after
they
told
him
to
get
it
off
his
chest,
the
words
came
tumbling
out.
he
confessed.
this
interrogation
then
resumed
with
two
officers
leaving
and
the
two
negro
officers
staying.
the
defendant
testifying
that
they
told
me
that
they
--
that
the
white
officers
were
going
to
throw
my
head
through
a
wall
unless,
i
told
them
what
they
wanted
to
hear.
they
showed
him
enumerable
pictures
he
testified
to.
and
from
these
pictures
he
told
them
what
happened
and
then
they
called
in
the
other
two
officers
who
had
left.
they
went
through
this
whole
business
again.
finally,
they
took
him
down
and
got
him
a
pair
of
shoes.
and
at
approximately
6:30,
an
assistant
states
attorney
was
called
who
testified
that
he
went
through
the
whole
business
with
lee
arthur.
went
through
what
happened
then
finally
at
6:45
o'clock
in
the
evening,
a
written
confession
was
commenced
in
the
presence
of
an
assistant
states
attorney,
a
sergeant
keating
for
the
chicago
police
department
and
a
donald
flanery,
a
court
reporter.
subsequently
this
was
transcribed
in
an
approximately
8:15
to
8:30
in
the
evening,
lee
arthur
has
to
sign
the
confession.
now,
it
is
the
contention
of
the
defendant
that
in
and
under
conventional
principles
of
due
process
forgetting
the
retroactivity
or
lack
thereof
of
miranda
and
escobedo
that
you
cannot
take
the
confession
of
a
14-year
old
of
the
type
that
i
have
described
after
incommunicado
holding
of
him,
failing
to
give
him
even
the
barest
rudiments
of
representation
or
having
anybody
stand
in
loco
parentis
to
him.
number
two,
forgetting
about
conventional
principles
of
due
process,
it
is
a
violation
of
due
process
not
to
take
a
statement,
excuse
me,
it
is
a
violation
of
due
process
to
take
a
statement
without
making
some
equalization
in
the
procedure
used
in
making
a
statement
between
a
juvenile
and
an
adult
and
may
i
point
it
out.
in
a
golf
game
we
give
a
handicap.
in
a
bowling
tournament,
we
give
pins
to
a
less
capable
bowler
as
opposed
to
a
bowler
who
is
more
capable.
in
a
horse
race
we
add
weights
to
the
faster
horse.
i
say
that
even
if
you
were
to
anoint
lee
arthur
hester
with
the
finest
of
oils
and
place
him
in
a
room
with
a
swimming
pool
and
velvet
walls,
you
cannot
take
a
confession
from
lee
arthur
hester
without
providing
him
some
rudiments
of
due
process.
fairness
that
in
order
to
assure
that
the
confession
is
voluntary,
when
you
take
it
in
a
setting
of
an
incommunicado
holding,
when
you
take
it
in
the
presence
of
only
police
officers
without
any
protections
whatsoever,
a
bell
must
ring,
a
light
must
go
on.
and
the
greatest
conceivable
care
must
be
given
so
that
the
confession
is
voluntary.
third,
in
our
brief
ask
the
court
to
abolish
the
taking
of
juvenile
confessions
because
there
is
no
possible
way
at
least
lee
arthur
hester
can
be
adequately
advised
of
his
rights.
advising
lee
arthur
hester
of
his
rights
is
like
advising
a
deaf
man
of
his
rights.
he
may
--
mr.
marshall
kaplan
in
my
brief
your
honor.
i
will
be
very
candid
with
you.
i
asked
you
to
make
a
rule
like
that.
i
think
it's
the
only
workable
rule
with
the
juvenile.
however,
this
case
can
be
decided
under
the
narrowest,
the
narrowest
principle.
but
to
be
candid,
yes
i
did
ask
to
make
that
rule.
and
that
this
case
can
be
examined,
we
must
look
at
what
kind
of
an
individual
is
lee
arthur
hester.
mr.
marshall
kaplan
we
have
a
problem
and
i'll
be
frank
to
admit
your
honor.
i
don't
know
how
to
resolve
that.
mr.
marshall
kaplan
your
honor,
we
have
a
problem.
everyday
of
our
--
mr.
marshall
kaplan
yes
your
honor.
now
going
back
to
the
basic
facts
in
this
case
and
conventional
due
process
rules,
this
case
can
be
resolved
by
placing
this
case
within
the
purport
and
the
ambit
of
all
of
those
cases
that
this
court
had
decided
from
graham
versus
mississippi
up
to
and
including
miranda
versus
arizona.
and
although
johnson
versus
new
jersey
may
not
require
--
does
not
require
miranda
to
be
applied
to
pre
miranda
cases.
nevertheless,
effect
that
a
man
was
held
incommunicado,
that
he
was
never
advised
of
his
rights,
that
he
has
a
mentality
of
an
8
year
old,
that
we
have
a
14
year
old
person
chronologically
14
with
the
mind
of
an
8
year
old.
we
really
in
effect
have
nothing
more
than
an
8
year
old
being
interrogated
by
police
officers
with
whom
he
could
not
possibly
cope
with.
not
only
that,
lee
arthur
hester
failed
in
school
6
times,
he
flunked
in
the
vernacular
of
the
street.
he
even
flunked
in
kindergarten.
records
concerning
this
were
introduced
in
evidence
not
objected
to
by
the
states.
a
psychologist
testified
completely
as
to
his
school
records.
mr.
justice
shafer
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
who
dissented
in
this
case
really
succinctly
laid
out
what
the
state
failed
to
do
in
this
case.
mr.
justice
shafer
said
that
he
would
reverse
this
conviction.
he
would
suppress
this
confession
because
the
state
failed
to
sustain
its
burden
of
proof
to
show
that
the
confession
was
voluntary.
two
police
officers
on
the
motion
to
suppress
evidence,
one
who
was
present
at
the
oral
--
that
the
first
oral
statement
and
shortly
after
4:00
and
a
court
reporter
was
all
the
state
called
on
the
motion
to
suppress.
that's
all
they
called,
they
rested.
now,
this
is
the
first
case
that
i
ever
tried.
young
counsel
who
should
have
been
given
more
courtesy
and
more
leniency
and
the
judge
had
have
extended
himself
much
more
in
a
14-year
old
--
to
a
14-year
old
defendant
then
he
ever
would
be
required
to
do
if
he
had
an
adult
defendant.
so,
we
ask
the
court
prior
to
the
hearing
commencing
to
exclude
witnesses.
we
noticed
all
the
police
officers
sitting
in
the
court.
judge
says
“i'm
only
going
to
exclude
witnesses
on
direct.
i
do
not
exclude
rebuttal
witnesses.”
so,
all
of
the
witnesses
except
the
two
i
mentioned
were
called
as
rebuttal
witnesses
and
i
think
we
made
the
motion
to
exclude
at
least
three
times.
so,
the
rebuttal
witnesses
sat
in
the
courtroom,
heard
what
all
of
the
other
rebuttal
witnesses
had
to
say
and
purely
by
the
court
exercising
its
discretion
and
not
excluding
rebuttal
witnesses
permitted
just
two
witnesses.
only
one
neither
of
whom
were
both
present
at
both
confession.
one
officer
was
present
at
the
oral
and
the
court
reporter
transcribed
the
confession
and
that
was
enough
to
force
us
to
go
forward.
maybe
we
shouldn't
have
gone
forward.
maybe
we
should
have
rested
at
that
time.
now
the
burden
of
proving
a
confession
voluntary,
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
has
really
ever
stated
who
has
the
burden
of
proving
the
confession
voluntary.
mr.
justice
white
in
jackson
v.
denno
set
forth
rather
succinctly
the
procedure
that
must
be
followed
in
a
motion
to
suppress
a
confession
but
who
has
the
burden.
or
under
illinois
law
and
to
the
line
cases
that
mr.
justice
shafer
cites
in
his
dissent,
there
is
no
doubt
that
an
illinois
law,
the
stake
has
the
burden
of
proving
the
confession
voluntary.
all
the
state
put
on
was
police
officers
and
a
court
reporter.
and
we
have
the
age
old
problem
that
existed
in
this
court
up
to
miranda
versus
arizona
of
the
state
puts
on
to
police
and
the
defendant
puts
on
the
defense,
the
jury
heard
the
facts,
the
jury
made
its
conclusion
and
the
jury
rules.
it's
impossible
when
all
you
have
is
a
14
year
old
with
an
8
year
old
mind.
it's
impossible
to
do
other
than
put
him
on
and
say
lee
arthur
tell
us
what
happened
that
day.
you
just
can't
do
anything
else.
the
police
get
on
and
say
we
treated
him
fine.
but
they
admit
that
they
kept
him
all
day.
they
even
admit
that
it
was
in
the
audi
home
which
is
a
stones
throw
a
walk,
a
long
cuff
from
the
hallway
of
the
audi
home
over
to
at
least
3
sitting
juvenile
court
judges.
not
once,
not
once
in
this
entire
matter
was
lee
arthur
taken
from
the
moment
of
his
arrest
until
the
moment
of
his
arraignment
after
indictment
by
a
grand
jury
two
weeks
later,
not
once
did
he
see
an
examining
magistrate,
not
once.
not
once
that
he
see
a
lawyer
until
monday
morning
when
my
associate
and
i
were
permitted
to
see
him
in
a
barred
room
which
was
guarded
outside.
not
once
was
he
permitted
to
see
his
mother.
so
that
when
you
examine
the
mentality
of
the
defendant,
his
ability
to
withstand
pressure,
the
fact
that
he
was
held
incommunicado,
the
fact
that
he
was
never
taken
before
magistrates,
the
fact
that
he
could
not
possibly
cope
with
the
scepters,
the
fact
that
when
you
take
a
confession
from
a
boy
like
this,
it's
like
the
proverbial
taking
candy
from
a
baby.
now
in
this
age
of
enlightenment,
in
this
progress
we
are
making
under
criminal
law
can
anyone
logically
say
that
it
would
have
been
improper
or
would
have
hindered
the
administration
of
justice
to
take
this
boy,
a
14
before
a
magistrate.
this
boy
who
is
probably
by
my
search
is,
i
can't
find
anybody
younger,
probably
the
youngest
defendant
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
supreme
court.
i
don't
think
there
has
ever
been
a
case
before
this
court
where
the
mentality
was
any
lower
and
those
cases
were
it
was
just
as
bad.
mr.
marshall
kaplan
gallegos
was
14.
hailey
was
15.
now
on
my
brief,
i
placed
a
great
stress
on
hailey
and
i
placed
a
great
stress
on
gallegos.
gallegos
confessed
within
two
minutes
after
his
apprehension
and
was
kept
in
a
juvenile
detention
home
for
some
4
to
5
days
and
then
made
a
written
confession,
in
fact
i
think
more
than
written
confession.
hailey
was
15,
a
senior
in
high
school,
15
years
8
months,
a
senior
in
high
school
who
was
questioned
for
five
hours.
in
both
those
cases,
there
is
no
question
of
brutality.
hailey,
a
senior
high
school
at
age
15
was
at
least
i
think
two
years
ahead
of
what
the
usual
high
school
student
would
be
at
that
time.
and
this
court
said
in
hailey
and
this
court
said
in
gallegos
that
we
must
be
extremely
careful
when
we
take
confessions
from
juveniles.
court
pointed
out
that
they
are
not
a
match
and
never
can
be
for
a
large
and
experienced
police
officer.
mr.
marshall
kaplan
yes,
we
have
a
juvenile
court
system.
mr.
marshall
kaplan
oh
yes!
but
they
got
around
that
real,
got
around
that
real
good
in
this
case.
in
the
record
i
filed
mr.
justice
harlan
in
this
case,
i
included
the
juvenile
court
proceedings
in
this
case.
saturday
morning,
the
day
after
hester's
confession,
saturday
morning,
a
petition
for
delinquency
was
filed
in
the
cook
county
juvenile
court
which
is
now
branch
of
circuit
court
of
cook
county.
that
petition
still
sits
to
this
day
undisposed.
mr.
marshall
kaplan
filed
by
--
it's
under
the
auspices
and
the
states
attorney
of
cook
county.
and
our
statute
at
that
time
stated
that
the
juvenile
courts
could
relinquish
its
jurisdiction
to
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county,
which
it
never
did
because
we
have
two
old
illinois
supreme
court
cases
which
say
that
a
juvenile
court
or
court
of
inferior
jurisdiction
and
a
criminal
courts
a
court
of
superior
jurisdiction.
and
therefore
that
section
of
the
statute
permitting
the
juvenile
court
to
waive
its
jurisdiction,
has
no
application
to
this
case.
hester
was
interrogated
in
the
juvenile
court.
he
was
interrogated
in
an
office
of
the
states
attorney
in
a
cubicle
existing
in
the
juvenile
court.
everything
in
this
case
started
out
as
a
juvenile
case.
a
confession
was
taken
under
juvenile
court
even
though
we
have
a
statute
in
illinois
which
i
cite
in
my
brief
which
precludes
the
admission
at
any
time
of
a
confession
taken
under
the
auspices
of
the
family
court
act.
i
desire
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal
if
you
don't
have
any
questions,
i
would
like
to
do
that.
mr.
marshall
kaplan
thank
you.
mr.
marshall
kaplan
thank
you.
i
had
been
tended
to
say
something
else
with
mr.
justice
harlan
raised
the
point
and
perhaps
mr.
boudin
didn't
say
enough
about
the
law.
there
is
no
doubt
that
whether
it's
1961
pre-miranda
or
1969
post
miranda.
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
our
premises
you
cannot
take
the
confession
from
a
boy
like
this.
this
case
must
be
examined
as
this
court
has
always
said
in
the
confession
case.
we
can
look
to
the
entire
record.
in
fact,
the
record
was
so
long
in
this
case,
the
court
asked
that
this
case
be
considered
on
the
entire
record
and
after
counsel
and
i
prepared
stipulations
for
record
designations
to
prepare
appendix
in
this
case,
the
clerk
notified
us
there
would
be
no
appendix,
it
was
too
long.
when
reviewing
each
factor
about
this
boy,
when
coupling
that
with
the
fact
that
it
took
seven,
eight,
nine,
ten
different
individuals,
seven
policeman,
a
states
attorney,
the
head
of
the
juvenile
detention
home,
when
you
coupled
that
with
the
inability
of
the
defendant.
when
you
add
to
that
hailey
versus
ohio
and
gallegos
versus
colorado.
it's
just
impossible
to
say
that
under
conventional
principles
of
due
process,
just
because
fortuitously
it
happened
to
be
1961
instead
of
1969
that
the
police
department
didn't
know
that
they
shouldn't
take
the
confession
below
14
year
old
almost
imbecile.
if
a
police
department
in
an
urban
center
like
chicago
with
a
population
of
three-and-a-half
million,
a
county
of
6
million
in
cook,
doesn't
know
that
they
can't
question
a
14-year-old
(inaudible)
without
this
court
telling
them
that
they
can't
and
they
don't
deserve
to
be
the
police
department.
now
i
can
see
that
there
are
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
that
may
fairly
have
a
price
prosecuting
authorities
of
police
authorities
of
what
the
law
was
after
the
case
was
decided.
but
conventional
due
process
looking
at
kolom
versus
connecticut
although
there
was
physical
brutality
there.
hailey
versus
ohio,
gallegos
versus
colorado,
fikes
versus
alabama,
blackburn
versus
alabama.
every
single
case
talks
about
psychological
coercion.
now,
lee
arthur
hester
can't
take
the
punishment
that
some
big,
tall,
strapping
fellow
who
streetwise
as
we
say
and
sometimes
i
hear
in
the
courthouse
that
he
has
got
the
smarts.
here
is
a
14
year
old
living
in
a
community
where
he
sees
almost
only
black
people.
his
primary
association
with
white
people
is
in
a
school.
here
is
a
boy
who
has
no
possible
association
at
all
with
police
per
se.
when
he
is
put
in
a
room
and
he
is
interrogated
by
four
officers,
one
officer
could
have
done
the
job
--
mr.
marshall
kaplan
no,
i
have
other
points
in
the
brief.
the
search
and
seizure
was
improper.
there
was
no
reason
to
take
all
of
his
clothes
and
leave
him
naked
like
--
and
then
except
with
a
smack
on
him
which
is
similar
to
malinski
versus
new
york.
there
was
no
reason
that
they
couldn't
have
gone
before
a
magistrate,
they
couldn't
even
got
the
warrant.
boy
is
in
school,
they
could
have
watched
him.
they
took
all
of
his
clothes,
they
hustle
these
clothes
to
a
crime
lab
which
took
three
or
four
weeks
analyzing
the
clothes
and
in
the
course
of
their
conversation
with
him,
told
him
that
all
the
evidence
shows
that
it's
your
blood.
a
hair
of
the
lady
is
on
your
jacket.
mr.
marshall
kaplan
i
do,
yes
in
this
case.
mr.
marshall
kaplan
that
they
could
have
gotten
the
warrant.
they're
all
--
i
know
what
the
general
rule
is
your
honor.
that
the
general
rule
that
in
a
lawful
arrest,
you
are
entitled
to
make
a
reasonable
search.
i
have
realized
that.
but
they
could
have
--
but
to
go
to
a
magistrate
in
this
case
would
have
destroyed
the
subsequent
examination
and
interrogation
of
the
squad
because
ones
he
is
before
a
magistrate,
a
detailed
inquiry
of
whether
this
is
the
guy,
a
detailed
inquiry
would
have
been
made.
and
lastly
your
honor
that
when
you
take
this
case,
and
the
total
absolute
inability
to
cope
with
his
captors
plus
the
fact
that
this
is
an
innocent
boy
sitting
in
the
penitentiary.
that
an
offer
of
proof
as
to
a
truth
serve
test
was
made
and
then
he
passed
a
truth
serum
test,
that
he
denied
unequivocally
that
he
had
any
knowledge
of
how
the
woman
had
met
her
demise.
i
say
that
when
a
judge
in
chambers
is
presented
with
testimony
like
that,
although
i
can't
find
any
basis
in
the
law
to
admit
a
truth
serum
test
into
evidence.
that
once
he
knows
that
a
boy
has
passed
a
truth
serum
test,
some
inquiry
has
to
be
made
as
to
whether
or
not
the
right
guy
is
on
trial.
you
just
can't
bury
your
head
in
the
sand
and
say,
"well,
the
law
doesn't
allow
the
truth
serum
test
to
be
admissible
in
evidence."
mr.
marshall
kaplan
no
i
don't.
it
would
not
have
been
admissible.
not
under
illinois
law.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
you
had
to
live
with
this
case.
my
associates
and
i
under
the
law
of
1961
couldn't
get
a
dime
to
hire
competent
people
to
come
to
the
state
or
people
from
our
own
state
to
testify,
that's
where
we
spent
$12,000.00
trying
and
appealing
this
case.
so
we
could
bring
in
a
blood
expert,
a
pathologist,
a
hand
writing
expert.
mr.
marshall
kaplan
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
marshall
kaplan
yes
your
honor.
mr.
marshall
kaplan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
this
court
to
review
the
murder
conviction
of
a
14-year
old
fifth
grade
elementary
school
negro
boy
on
the
south
side
of
chicago.
the
confession
that
he
gave
primarily,
being
responsible
for
his
subsequent
conviction
in
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county
illinois
and
his
subsequent
incarceration
for
55
years
in
the
illinois
state
penitentiary.
on
april
20,
1961
at
4
o'clock
in
the
afternoon,
the
body
of
a
school
teacher
in
the
lewis
champlain
elementary
school
on
the
south
side
of
chicago
illinois
was
found,
she
was
dead.
she
had
been
stabbed
numerous
times
and
it
appeared
that
she
had
been
sexually
molested.
16
hours
after
her
body
was
found,
lee
arthur
hester
was
removed
from
his
school
room
at
the
lewis
champlain
school
which
would
put
it
at
approximately
8
o'clock
am.
from
8
o'clock
am
on
april
21,
a
friday
1961
to
the
minute
i
stand
before
you,
lee
arthur
hester
has
been
incarcerated.
most
of
the
time
at
the
illinois
state
penitentiary,
part
of
the
time
in
the
cook
county
jail
and
some
other
time
in
the
audi
home,
the
juvenile
detention
home
in
chicago
illinois.
the
school
where
lee
arthur
hester
attended
had
approximately
2,600
students
attending
in
double
shifts.
hester
going
from
8
to
12
in
the
morning
and
another
group
going
from
12
to
approximately
3
or
4
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
on
the
same
grounds
of
this
school
was
a
high
school
called
the
englewood
high
school
just
separated
a
little
distance
away
through
a
courtyard
or
field
and
that
had
2,000
students
approximately
and
then
there
was
a
continuation
school.
a
school
in
chicago
which
houses
and
teaches
older
students
who
drop
out
of
school
who
because
the
state
law
are
required
to
attend
school
until
a
certain
age,
16
or
17
years
of
age.
two
police
officers
came
to
hester's
room
shortly
before
8
o'clock
a.m.
in
a
company
of
a
gym
teacher,
who
had
stated
to
the
officers
that
she
had
seen
hester
in
the
hall,
sometime
the
day
before,
and
i
believe
she
said
she
saw
him
running.
the
officers
rummaged
through
the
records
of
the
teacher
that
--
in
whose
room,
hester
was
a
student.
when
the
teacher
came
to
the
room,
they
told
everyone
to
see
lee
arthur.
she
told
this
to
lee
arthur,
she
sent
him
out
of
the
room,
they
kept
him
a
couple
of
minutes,
they
sent
him
back
and
the
teachers
says
--
said
and
she
testified
to
this.
what
--
or
he
testified
to
this.
"what
do
they
want
from
lee
arthur?"
he
says
“they
think
i
killed
mrs.
keen”.
and
the
whole
room
started
to
laugh.
from
that
moment
until
a
confession
was
signed,
sometime
between
8:15
and
8:30
in
the
evening
of
friday,
that
day
was
friday,
april
21,
1961.
lee
arthur
hester
was
in
to
a
continuous
unbroken
custody
of
at
least
7
police
officers
of
the
chicago
police
department
who
kept
hester
from
about
8
o'clock
in
the
morning
until
8:45
a.m.
questioning
him.
those
two
officers,
sheldon
r.
teller
and
another
officer
by
the
name
of
anton
franco
who
then
turned
hester
over
to
another
officer
by
the
name
of
feliz
in
the
principal's
office
who
kept
him
for
approximately
15
minutes,
who
then
turned
hester
over
to
two
other
officers,
robert
perkins
and
an
officer
by
the
name
of
harold
thomas
who
then
took
hester
to
a
police
station
in
the
neighborhood.
they
switched
automobiles
and
they
took
him
to
the
audi
home,
the
juvenile
detention
home.
hester
was
searched
at
the
juvenile
detention
home.
all
of
his
clothing
was
removed
and
from
his
pockets,
all
of
his
belongings
removed
including
and
i
beg
your
honor
to
consider
what
was
removed
from
the
pockets,
marbles.
now
at
this
time,
hester
was
14
years
5
days
of
age.
his
iq
was
either
75
or
82
and
the
reason
that
it
is
either
that
there
are
a
couple
of
test
included
in
the
record
submitted
an
evidence,
one
shows
he
was
75
and
the
other
that
his
iq
was
82.
he
was
one
of
8
children
of
a
ghetto
family.
his
reading
rate
was
approximately
that
of
a
second
grader
in
grammar
school
that
slightly
lower
going
to
the
school
records.
his
mathematics
ability
was
graded
at
approximately
third
grade.
his
school
records
indicate
from
psychological
testing
that
his
maximum,
his
maximum
emotional
growth
was
9
years
of
age
or
as
the
record
show,
4.7
excuse
me,
4
a
grammar
school.
4
a
grammar
school
usually
a
child
of
normal
progression
school
reaches
the
fourth
grade
when
he
is
9
years
old.
in
my
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
i
have
an
error
i
believe
at
page
6
i'm
not
sure.
i
say
that
the
--
i
made
a
mistake
and
said
that
the
maximum
emotional
growth
was
11
years
old.
mr.
justice
underwood
who
wrote
the
majority
opinion
for
the
supreme
court
said
that
the
defendant
had
a
maximum
emotional
growth
or
a
mentality.
we
find
he
had
a
mentality
of
an
11
year
old
although
he
was
qualified
to
give
a
confession.
anyway,
not
to
interrupt
the
chronology
of
what
happened,
at
approximately
4
o'clock
in
the
afternoon,
after
having
been
detained
from
10:30
in
the
morning
until
4:00
in
the
afternoon,
lee
arthur
hester
was
interrogated
by
four
obliged
police
officers.
now,
hester
was
5
feet
one
and
a
half
inches
tall
i
believe,
a
111
and
a
half
inch
--
a
111
and
a
half
pounds.
hester
could
barely
read.
hester
could
barely
compute.
hester
could
barely
understand.
hester
was
not
insane
and
we
admit
it.
not
once
in
the
entire
day
that
he
was
kept
either
in
custody
or
interrogated,
was
he
permitted
to
see
his
mother
whom
he
repeatedly
requested
to
see
“i
want
to
see
my
mama.”
not
once
was
he
permitted
to
see
a
probation
officer.
not
once
was
he
permitted
to
see
his
father
or
lawyer
or
anyone
standing
in
loco
parentis
to
him,
not
once.
every
single
witness
who
testified
for
the
prosecution
testified
that
we
did
not
warn
him
that
he
need
not
make
a
statement.
that
we
did
not
warn
him
that
anything
he
said
could
be
used
against
him.
that
we
did
not
warn
him
he
was
entitled
to
counsel
and
we
did
not
warn
him
if
he
couldn't
afford
counsel,
we
give
him
counsel.
now
i
know
that
those
are
the
four
requirements
of
miranda
versus
arizona.
now,
our
basic
point
today
your
honors
is
that
in
three
ways,
this
confession
must
fall.
the
first
way
that
basically,
specifically
and
unequivocally,
you
cannot
take
a
confession
from
a
person
almost
illiterate.
now
when
he
is
14
years
old,
you
must
couple
that
with
what
we
know
we
cannot
forget
as
lawyers
what
we
know
as
men.
i
believe
justice
frankfurter
once
said
that
and
i
think
it
was
in
kolom
versus
connecticut.
we
can't
forget
that
a
14
year
old
in
the
ghetto
who
can
barely
read
has
no
experience
with
life.
we
cannot
forget
that
a
14
year
old
in
to
custody
of
approximately
7
police
officers
is
no
match
for
these
police
officers.
when
you
couple
that
with
the
fact
that
these
four
police
officers
walked
in
to
a
room
at
4
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
and
testified,
that's
in
the
record
when
my
associate
who
was
sitting
at
that
table
asked
him.
"what
did
you
say
to
lee
arthur
when
you
walked
in?"
"we
introduced
ourselves."
"and
how
long
did
you
stay?"
"five
minutes."
and
after
five
minutes,
after
they
told
him
to
get
it
off
his
chest,
the
words
came
tumbling
out.
he
confessed.
this
interrogation
then
resumed
with
two
officers
leaving
and
the
two
negro
officers
staying.
the
defendant
testifying
that
they
told
me
that
they
--
that
the
white
officers
were
going
to
throw
my
head
through
a
wall
unless,
i
told
them
what
they
wanted
to
hear.
they
showed
him
enumerable
pictures
he
testified
to.
and
from
these
pictures
he
told
them
what
happened
and
then
they
called
in
the
other
two
officers
who
had
left.
they
went
through
this
whole
business
again.
finally,
they
took
him
down
and
got
him
a
pair
of
shoes.
and
at
approximately
6:30,
an
assistant
states
attorney
was
called
who
testified
that
he
went
through
the
whole
business
with
lee
arthur.
went
through
what
happened
then
finally
at
6:45
o'clock
in
the
evening,
a
written
confession
was
commenced
in
the
presence
of
an
assistant
states
attorney,
a
sergeant
keating
for
the
chicago
police
department
and
a
donald
flanery,
a
court
reporter.
subsequently
this
was
transcribed
in
an
approximately
8:15
to
8:30
in
the
evening,
lee
arthur
has
to
sign
the
confession.
now,
it
is
the
contention
of
the
defendant
that
in
and
under
conventional
principles
of
due
process
forgetting
the
retroactivity
or
lack
thereof
of
miranda
and
escobedo
that
you
cannot
take
the
confession
of
a
14-year
old
of
the
type
that
i
have
described
after
incommunicado
holding
of
him,
failing
to
give
him
even
the
barest
rudiments
of
representation
or
having
anybody
stand
in
loco
parentis
to
him.
number
two,
forgetting
about
conventional
principles
of
due
process,
it
is
a
violation
of
due
process
not
to
take
a
statement,
excuse
me,
it
is
a
violation
of
due
process
to
take
a
statement
without
making
some
equalization
in
the
procedure
used
in
making
a
statement
between
a
juvenile
and
an
adult
and
may
i
point
it
out.
in
a
golf
game
we
give
a
handicap.
in
a
bowling
tournament,
we
give
pins
to
a
less
capable
bowler
as
opposed
to
a
bowler
who
is
more
capable.
in
a
horse
race
we
add
weights
to
the
faster
horse.
i
say
that
even
if
you
were
to
anoint
lee
arthur
hester
with
the
finest
of
oils
and
place
him
in
a
room
with
a
swimming
pool
and
velvet
walls,
you
cannot
take
a
confession
from
lee
arthur
hester
without
providing
him
some
rudiments
of
due
process.
fairness
that
in
order
to
assure
that
the
confession
is
voluntary,
when
you
take
it
in
a
setting
of
an
incommunicado
holding,
when
you
take
it
in
the
presence
of
only
police
officers
without
any
protections
whatsoever,
a
bell
must
ring,
a
light
must
go
on.
and
the
greatest
conceivable
care
must
be
given
so
that
the
confession
is
voluntary.
third,
in
our
brief
ask
the
court
to
abolish
the
taking
of
juvenile
confessions
because
there
is
no
possible
way
at
least
lee
arthur
hester
can
be
adequately
advised
of
his
rights.
advising
lee
arthur
hester
of
his
rights
is
like
advising
a
deaf
man
of
his
rights.
he
may
--
mr.
marshall
kaplan
in
my
brief
your
honor.
i
will
be
very
candid
with
you.
i
asked
you
to
make
a
rule
like
that.
i
think
it's
the
only
workable
rule
with
the
juvenile.
however,
this
case
can
be
decided
under
the
narrowest,
the
narrowest
principle.
but
to
be
candid,
yes
i
did
ask
to
make
that
rule.
and
that
this
case
can
be
examined,
we
must
look
at
what
kind
of
an
individual
is
lee
arthur
hester.
mr.
marshall
kaplan
we
have
a
problem
and
i'll
be
frank
to
admit
your
honor.
i
don't
know
how
to
resolve
that.
mr.
marshall
kaplan
your
honor,
we
have
a
problem.
everyday
of
our
--
mr.
marshall
kaplan
yes
your
honor.
now
going
back
to
the
basic
facts
in
this
case
and
conventional
due
process
rules,
this
case
can
be
resolved
by
placing
this
case
within
the
purport
and
the
ambit
of
all
of
those
cases
that
this
court
had
decided
from
graham
versus
mississippi
up
to
and
including
miranda
versus
arizona.
and
although
johnson
versus
new
jersey
may
not
require
--
does
not
require
miranda
to
be
applied
to
pre
miranda
cases.
nevertheless,
effect
that
a
man
was
held
incommunicado,
that
he
was
never
advised
of
his
rights,
that
he
has
a
mentality
of
an
8
year
old,
that
we
have
a
14
year
old
person
chronologically
14
with
the
mind
of
an
8
year
old.
we
really
in
effect
have
nothing
more
than
an
8
year
old
being
interrogated
by
police
officers
with
whom
he
could
not
possibly
cope
with.
not
only
that,
lee
arthur
hester
failed
in
school
6
times,
he
flunked
in
the
vernacular
of
the
street.
he
even
flunked
in
kindergarten.
records
concerning
this
were
introduced
in
evidence
not
objected
to
by
the
states.
a
psychologist
testified
completely
as
to
his
school
records.
mr.
justice
shafer
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
who
dissented
in
this
case
really
succinctly
laid
out
what
the
state
failed
to
do
in
this
case.
mr.
justice
shafer
said
that
he
would
reverse
this
conviction.
he
would
suppress
this
confession
because
the
state
failed
to
sustain
its
burden
of
proof
to
show
that
the
confession
was
voluntary.
two
police
officers
on
the
motion
to
suppress
evidence,
one
who
was
present
at
the
oral
--
that
the
first
oral
statement
and
shortly
after
4:00
and
a
court
reporter
was
all
the
state
called
on
the
motion
to
suppress.
that's
all
they
called,
they
rested.
now,
this
is
the
first
case
that
i
ever
tried.
young
counsel
who
should
have
been
given
more
courtesy
and
more
leniency
and
the
judge
had
have
extended
himself
much
more
in
a
14-year
old
--
to
a
14-year
old
defendant
then
he
ever
would
be
required
to
do
if
he
had
an
adult
defendant.
so,
we
ask
the
court
prior
to
the
hearing
commencing
to
exclude
witnesses.
we
noticed
all
the
police
officers
sitting
in
the
court.
judge
says
“i'm
only
going
to
exclude
witnesses
on
direct.
i
do
not
exclude
rebuttal
witnesses.”
so,
all
of
the
witnesses
except
the
two
i
mentioned
were
called
as
rebuttal
witnesses
and
i
think
we
made
the
motion
to
exclude
at
least
three
times.
so,
the
rebuttal
witnesses
sat
in
the
courtroom,
heard
what
all
of
the
other
rebuttal
witnesses
had
to
say
and
purely
by
the
court
exercising
its
discretion
and
not
excluding
rebuttal
witnesses
permitted
just
two
witnesses.
only
one
neither
of
whom
were
both
present
at
both
confession.
one
officer
was
present
at
the
oral
and
the
court
reporter
transcribed
the
confession
and
that
was
enough
to
force
us
to
go
forward.
maybe
we
shouldn't
have
gone
forward.
maybe
we
should
have
rested
at
that
time.
now
the
burden
of
proving
a
confession
voluntary,
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
has
really
ever
stated
who
has
the
burden
of
proving
the
confession
voluntary.
mr.
justice
white
in
jackson
v.
denno
set
forth
rather
succinctly
the
procedure
that
must
be
followed
in
a
motion
to
suppress
a
confession
but
who
has
the
burden.
or
under
illinois
law
and
to
the
line
cases
that
mr.
justice
shafer
cites
in
his
dissent,
there
is
no
doubt
that
an
illinois
law,
the
stake
has
the
burden
of
proving
the
confession
voluntary.
all
the
state
put
on
was
police
officers
and
a
court
reporter.
and
we
have
the
age
old
problem
that
existed
in
this
court
up
to
miranda
versus
arizona
of
the
state
puts
on
to
police
and
the
defendant
puts
on
the
defense,
the
jury
heard
the
facts,
the
jury
made
its
conclusion
and
the
jury
rules.
it's
impossible
when
all
you
have
is
a
14
year
old
with
an
8
year
old
mind.
it's
impossible
to
do
other
than
put
him
on
and
say
lee
arthur
tell
us
what
happened
that
day.
you
just
can't
do
anything
else.
the
police
get
on
and
say
we
treated
him
fine.
but
they
admit
that
they
kept
him
all
day.
they
even
admit
that
it
was
in
the
audi
home
which
is
a
stones
throw
a
walk,
a
long
cuff
from
the
hallway
of
the
audi
home
over
to
at
least
3
sitting
juvenile
court
judges.
not
once,
not
once
in
this
entire
matter
was
lee
arthur
taken
from
the
moment
of
his
arrest
until
the
moment
of
his
arraignment
after
indictment
by
a
grand
jury
two
weeks
later,
not
once
did
he
see
an
examining
magistrate,
not
once.
not
once
that
he
see
a
lawyer
until
monday
morning
when
my
associate
and
i
were
permitted
to
see
him
in
a
barred
room
which
was
guarded
outside.
not
once
was
he
permitted
to
see
his
mother.
so
that
when
you
examine
the
mentality
of
the
defendant,
his
ability
to
withstand
pressure,
the
fact
that
he
was
held
incommunicado,
the
fact
that
he
was
never
taken
before
magistrates,
the
fact
that
he
could
not
possibly
cope
with
the
scepters,
the
fact
that
when
you
take
a
confession
from
a
boy
like
this,
it's
like
the
proverbial
taking
candy
from
a
baby.
now
in
this
age
of
enlightenment,
in
this
progress
we
are
making
under
criminal
law
can
anyone
logically
say
that
it
would
have
been
improper
or
would
have
hindered
the
administration
of
justice
to
take
this
boy,
a
14
before
a
magistrate.
this
boy
who
is
probably
by
my
search
is,
i
can't
find
anybody
younger,
probably
the
youngest
defendant
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
supreme
court.
i
don't
think
there
has
ever
been
a
case
before
this
court
where
the
mentality
was
any
lower
and
those
cases
were
it
was
just
as
bad.
mr.
marshall
kaplan
gallegos
was
14.
hailey
was
15.
now
on
my
brief,
i
placed
a
great
stress
on
hailey
and
i
placed
a
great
stress
on
gallegos.
gallegos
confessed
within
two
minutes
after
his
apprehension
and
was
kept
in
a
juvenile
detention
home
for
some
4
to
5
days
and
then
made
a
written
confession,
in
fact
i
think
more
than
written
confession.
hailey
was
15,
a
senior
in
high
school,
15
years
8
months,
a
senior
in
high
school
who
was
questioned
for
five
hours.
in
both
those
cases,
there
is
no
question
of
brutality.
hailey,
a
senior
high
school
at
age
15
was
at
least
i
think
two
years
ahead
of
what
the
usual
high
school
student
would
be
at
that
time.
and
this
court
said
in
hailey
and
this
court
said
in
gallegos
that
we
must
be
extremely
careful
when
we
take
confessions
from
juveniles.
court
pointed
out
that
they
are
not
a
match
and
never
can
be
for
a
large
and
experienced
police
officer.
mr.
marshall
kaplan
yes,
we
have
a
juvenile
court
system.
mr.
marshall
kaplan
oh
yes!
but
they
got
around
that
real,
got
around
that
real
good
in
this
case.
in
the
record
i
filed
mr.
justice
harlan
in
this
case,
i
included
the
juvenile
court
proceedings
in
this
case.
saturday
morning,
the
day
after
hester's
confession,
saturday
morning,
a
petition
for
delinquency
was
filed
in
the
cook
county
juvenile
court
which
is
now
branch
of
circuit
court
of
cook
county.
that
petition
still
sits
to
this
day
undisposed.
mr.
marshall
kaplan
filed
by
--
it's
under
the
auspices
and
the
states
attorney
of
cook
county.
and
our
statute
at
that
time
stated
that
the
juvenile
courts
could
relinquish
its
jurisdiction
to
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county,
which
it
never
did
because
we
have
two
old
illinois
supreme
court
cases
which
say
that
a
juvenile
court
or
court
of
inferior
jurisdiction
and
a
criminal
courts
a
court
of
superior
jurisdiction.
and
therefore
that
section
of
the
statute
permitting
the
juvenile
court
to
waive
its
jurisdiction,
has
no
application
to
this
case.
hester
was
interrogated
in
the
juvenile
court.
he
was
interrogated
in
an
office
of
the
states
attorney
in
a
cubicle
existing
in
the
juvenile
court.
everything
in
this
case
started
out
as
a
juvenile
case.
a
confession
was
taken
under
juvenile
court
even
though
we
have
a
statute
in
illinois
which
i
cite
in
my
brief
which
precludes
the
admission
at
any
time
of
a
confession
taken
under
the
auspices
of
the
family
court
act.
i
desire
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal
if
you
don't
have
any
questions,
i
would
like
to
do
that.
mr.
marshall
kaplan
thank
you.
mr.
marshall
kaplan
thank
you.
i
had
been
tended
to
say
something
else
with
mr.
justice
harlan
raised
the
point
and
perhaps
mr.
boudin
didn't
say
enough
about
the
law.
there
is
no
doubt
that
whether
it's
1961
pre-miranda
or
1969
post
miranda.
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
our
premises
you
cannot
take
the
confession
from
a
boy
like
this.
this
case
must
be
examined
as
this
court
has
always
said
in
the
confession
case.
we
can
look
to
the
entire
record.
in
fact,
the
record
was
so
long
in
this
case,
the
court
asked
that
this
case
be
considered
on
the
entire
record
and
after
counsel
and
i
prepared
stipulations
for
record
designations
to
prepare
appendix
in
this
case,
the
clerk
notified
us
there
would
be
no
appendix,
it
was
too
long.
when
reviewing
each
factor
about
this
boy,
when
coupling
that
with
the
fact
that
it
took
seven,
eight,
nine,
ten
different
individuals,
seven
policeman,
a
states
attorney,
the
head
of
the
juvenile
detention
home,
when
you
coupled
that
with
the
inability
of
the
defendant.
when
you
add
to
that
hailey
versus
ohio
and
gallegos
versus
colorado.
it's
just
impossible
to
say
that
under
conventional
principles
of
due
process,
just
because
fortuitously
it
happened
to
be
1961
instead
of
1969
that
the
police
department
didn't
know
that
they
shouldn't
take
the
confession
below
14
year
old
almost
imbecile.
if
a
police
department
in
an
urban
center
like
chicago
with
a
population
of
three-and-a-half
million,
a
county
of
6
million
in
cook,
doesn't
know
that
they
can't
question
a
14-year-old
(inaudible)
without
this
court
telling
them
that
they
can't
and
they
don't
deserve
to
be
the
police
department.
now
i
can
see
that
there
are
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
that
may
fairly
have
a
price
prosecuting
authorities
of
police
authorities
of
what
the
law
was
after
the
case
was
decided.
but
conventional
due
process
looking
at
kolom
versus
connecticut
although
there
was
physical
brutality
there.
hailey
versus
ohio,
gallegos
versus
colorado,
fikes
versus
alabama,
blackburn
versus
alabama.
every
single
case
talks
about
psychological
coercion.
now,
lee
arthur
hester
can't
take
the
punishment
that
some
big,
tall,
strapping
fellow
who
streetwise
as
we
say
and
sometimes
i
hear
in
the
courthouse
that
he
has
got
the
smarts.
here
is
a
14
year
old
living
in
a
community
where
he
sees
almost
only
black
people.
his
primary
association
with
white
people
is
in
a
school.
here
is
a
boy
who
has
no
possible
association
at
all
with
police
per
se.
when
he
is
put
in
a
room
and
he
is
interrogated
by
four
officers,
one
officer
could
have
done
the
job
--
mr.
marshall
kaplan
no,
i
have
other
points
in
the
brief.
the
search
and
seizure
was
improper.
there
was
no
reason
to
take
all
of
his
clothes
and
leave
him
naked
like
--
and
then
except
with
a
smack
on
him
which
is
similar
to
malinski
versus
new
york.
there
was
no
reason
that
they
couldn't
have
gone
before
a
magistrate,
they
couldn't
even
got
the
warrant.
boy
is
in
school,
they
could
have
watched
him.
they
took
all
of
his
clothes,
they
hustle
these
clothes
to
a
crime
lab
which
took
three
or
four
weeks
analyzing
the
clothes
and
in
the
course
of
their
conversation
with
him,
told
him
that
all
the
evidence
shows
that
it's
your
blood.
a
hair
of
the
lady
is
on
your
jacket.
mr.
marshall
kaplan
i
do,
yes
in
this
case.
mr.
marshall
kaplan
that
they
could
have
gotten
the
warrant.
they're
all
--
i
know
what
the
general
rule
is
your
honor.
that
the
general
rule
that
in
a
lawful
arrest,
you
are
entitled
to
make
a
reasonable
search.
i
have
realized
that.
but
they
could
have
--
but
to
go
to
a
magistrate
in
this
case
would
have
destroyed
the
subsequent
examination
and
interrogation
of
the
squad
because
ones
he
is
before
a
magistrate,
a
detailed
inquiry
of
whether
this
is
the
guy,
a
detailed
inquiry
would
have
been
made.
and
lastly
your
honor
that
when
you
take
this
case,
and
the
total
absolute
inability
to
cope
with
his
captors
plus
the
fact
that
this
is
an
innocent
boy
sitting
in
the
penitentiary.
that
an
offer
of
proof
as
to
a
truth
serve
test
was
made
and
then
he
passed
a
truth
serum
test,
that
he
denied
unequivocally
that
he
had
any
knowledge
of
how
the
woman
had
met
her
demise.
i
say
that
when
a
judge
in
chambers
is
presented
with
testimony
like
that,
although
i
can't
find
any
basis
in
the
law
to
admit
a
truth
serum
test
into
evidence.
that
once
he
knows
that
a
boy
has
passed
a
truth
serum
test,
some
inquiry
has
to
be
made
as
to
whether
or
not
the
right
guy
is
on
trial.
you
just
can't
bury
your
head
in
the
sand
and
say,
"well,
the
law
doesn't
allow
the
truth
serum
test
to
be
admissible
in
evidence."
mr.
marshall
kaplan
no
i
don't.
it
would
not
have
been
admissible.
not
under
illinois
law.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
you
had
to
live
with
this
case.
my
associates
and
i
under
the
law
of
1961
couldn't
get
a
dime
to
hire
competent
people
to
come
to
the
state
or
people
from
our
own
state
to
testify,
that's
where
we
spent
$12,000.00
trying
and
appealing
this
case.
so
we
could
bring
in
a
blood
expert,
a
pathologist,
a
hand
writing
expert.
mr.
marshall
kaplan
thank
you
very
much.
