mr.
joel
m.
flaum
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
you
have
before
you
a
case
where
the
proof
of
guilt
we
suggest
is
overwhelming.
that
statement
we
make
in
consideration
even
if
the
confession
were
to
be
said
to
one
side.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes
he
did
your
honor.
yes
he
did.
and
we
feel
that
the
majority
in
the
opinion
reflected
by
mr.
chief
justice
underwood,
now
chief
justice
underwood
where
they
felt
a
scientific
evidence
was
so
overwhelming.
that
it
is
on
that
we
base
it
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
difficulty
at
first
in
rebuttal
is
that
counsel
for
the
respondent
find
it
very
difficult
to
recognize
this
case
from
the
facts
as
presented
by
the
petitioner.
but
before
i
make
any
reference
to
that,
let
me
just
say
that
the
petitioner
raised
the
host
of
points
in
this
petition
for
certiorari
in
brief.
we
feel
one
of
his
only
constitutional
dimension.
that
is
the
one
he
has
chose
and
argue
this
morning.
we
put
aside
those
others.
we
will
address
ourselves
to
the
confession.
in
1961,
the
petitioner
hester
was
14
years
old.
he
was
in
the
fifth
grade.
he
was
not
given
miranda
warnings
before
he
confessed
after
five
minutes
of
interrogation.
those
confessions
were
voluntarily
given
we
suggest
and
this
conviction
should
be
sustained.
if
we
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
61
your
honor.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
pre
miranda,
april
of
61
is
the
date
of
the
commission
of
the
crime,
the
conviction
is
october
of
'61.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
he
saw
his
mother
your
honor
at
10
am
the
following
morning.
the
statement
made
by
counsel
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
he
had
it
on
monday
morning
your
honor,
48
hours
right
off.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
and
he
was
not
informed
of
his
right
to
have
counsel.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
at
10
am
the
next
morning
your
honor.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
after
the
confession.
confession
was
signed
at
8
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well
your
honor,
we
suggest
that
this
is
the
situation,
1961,
what
did
the
prosecuting
authorities
of
cook
county
have
by
the
way
of
case
law
to
rely
upon.
there
was
no
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
excuse
me
your
honor?
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
i
understand
your
honor.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes
it
was.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
your
honor,
that
--
there
is
where
we
take
strong
exception
if
i
may.
there
is
no
abstract
in
this
case,
there
is
a
record.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
and
the
record
--
he
was
in
the
fifth
grade
your
honor.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
he
was
a
poor
reader.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well
your
honor,
the
test
that
hester
underwent
as
does
any
ghetto
youth
in
1961
and
hopefully
it's
different
today,
are
structured
for
white
urban
culture.
hester
can
be
best
judged
by
his
dialog
with
the
police
in
the
trial
transcript
here.
i
suggest
he
was
not
a
retiring
youth.
he
is
an
aggressive
youth,
that's
what
the
records
indicate
the
psychological
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
he
was
14
your
honor
and
he
only
reached
the
fifth
grade.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
there's
no
request
for
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well
your
honor,
if
i
may,
the
circumstances
to
that
confession
on
how
quickly
that
was
obtained.
there
was
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
there
were
none.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
no.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
hester
was
confronted
at
8
am
in
his
school
by
two
policeman.
after
being
questioned
and
interviewed
for
45
minutes
in
the
school
balcony
by
two
policeman,
he
was
taken
to
the
principals
office
or
a
sub
office.
in
that
sub
office,
no
interrogation
went
on.
there
was
no
admission
of
guilt
during
the
45
minute
interview
and
hester
says,
as
fast
as
they
ask
me
question,
i
gave
it
back
to
them.
that's
the
incompetent
shy
retiring
14-year
old
shown
by
counsel.
i
suggest
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
record
will
reflect.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
i
will
come
to
that.
the
next
period
your
honor,
he
stays
in
that
room
for
15
minutes
with
one
police
officer.
the
two
bring
him
to
a
sergeant
feliz,
he
remains
there
and
nothing
is
done.
two
policeman
transport
him
to
the
audi
juvenile
detention
home.
at
that
time
he
is
left
there
for
6
hours
from
10
to
4
in
custody
but
not
in
direct
police
custody.
he
has
never
--
under
the
supervision,
he
was
placed
in
an
infirmary
room
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
your
honor,
the
record
there
has
a
problem.
the
mother
testifies
that
two
officers
came
at
1:30
that
afternoon.
in
other
words,
within
a
few
hours
after
his
apprehension.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes
your
honor,
it
would
be
about
4
hours.
the
police
officers
testify
actually
that
they
came
a
half
hour
to
45
minutes
later.
2:30
to
3.
because
--
and
justice
shafer
points
this
out
in
his
dissent.
because
of
objections
by
both
sides,
the
actual
testimony
of
what
occurred
with
these
officers,
what
they
said
to
the
mother
and
what
the
mother
said
to
them
is
never
in
this
record
and
they
must
be
candid
about
that.
the
majority
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
concludes
that
if
the
officers
went
to
his
house
at
1:30
within
4
hours
after
his
arrest
and
before
any
confession
was
obtained,
they
went
to
inform
her.
but
the
record
is
not
clear
on
the
exact
language
used
and
so
i
don't
want
to
make
the
representation.
we
can
--
i
rely
only
on
our
state
supreme
court
and
that's
the
view
we
take,
that
they
went
to
inform
in
nearly
afternoon.
now,
he
is
left
alone
from
10
till
4.
i
say
left
alone
and
of
course
he
is
in
custody
of
the
audi
home
but
he
is
not
interrogated
in
any
way.
he
is
given
a
medical
examination
and
lunch.
at
4
o'clock,
4
officers
come.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
why
four
o'clock?
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
why
there
had
be
four
officers
at
the
scene?
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
why
there
were
four.
two
were
from
homicide,
two
--
i
don't
recall
the
exact
area
they
identified,
two
homicide
officers
in
the
city
of
chicago
working
there.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well,
at
4
o'clock,
they
come
--
the
four
officers
confront
this
boy
your
honor.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
all
by
himself
for
five
minutes.
and
then
the
two
of
the
four
officers
leave.
two
of
the
officers
revealed
to
hester
that
certain
lab
tests
were
conducted
at
an
intervening
10
am
to
4
pm
period,
and
they
showed
results
connecting
him
with
the
crime.
two
officers
leave
and
as
counsel
says,
one
of
the
officers
says
get
it
off
of
your
chest,
within
a
five
minute
period,
that's
all
i
described
occurs
in
a
five
minute
period.
hester
starts
to
make
a
statement.
it
is
admittedly
exculpatory.
he
calls
it
an
accident.
and
if
i
can
just
make
one
passing
mention
to
the
kind
of
individual,
we
suggest
hester
is,
and
how
he
should
be
viewed.
hester
later
continued
to
talk
to
the
officers
for
approximately
45
minutes.
at
5
o'clock,
given
a
medical
examination
and
left
alone.
so
we
have
--
within
5
minutes
of
the
initial
contact
with
the
officers
at
confession,
45
minutes
approximately
of
explanation
and
then
he's
left
alone,
and
an
assistant
states
attorney
comes
which
is
quite
often
a
practice
in
homicide
cases
in
cook
county
where
an
assistant
takes
the
formal
confession.
when
that
confession
was
taken,
corrections
were
made
by
hester.
this
is
the
kind
of
corrections
for
example,
he
made.
hester
would
suggest
where
he
had
said
"i
kicked
certain
books
going
into
the
book
room",
which
was
the
scene
of
the
murder.
hester
changed
them
to
"i
tripped
over
them."
i
think
the
reflection
shown
by
the
corrections
in
the
confession
which
are
contained
of
course
in
the
record,
belay
the
fact
that
we
have
the
kind
of
individual
suggested
by
the
petitioner
in
his
statement
of
facts.
the
early
45
minute
interview
in
the
school
produced
absolutely
no
admissions
by
hester.
and
he
made
the
statement
“as
fast
as
they
could
ask
me,
i
could
answer
the
questions”.
this
case
we
suggest
is
not
hailey.
in
hailey
your
honor,
is
what
the
state
of
illinois
had
to
rely
upon
in
1961.
in
hailey,
you
have
questioning
of
a
15
year
old
in
a
dead
of
night.
the
questioning
takes
5
hours.
there
is
a
detention
in
a
jail
not
a
juvenile
home.
there
is
relay
questionings
were
there
--
which
was
totally
absent
your
honors
in
hester.
there
is
a
suggestion
of
brutality
because
the
mother
testified
as
to
seeing
certain
evidences
of
blood
and
bruises,
and
i
believe
the
majority
opinion
suggests
that
there
is
a
discounting
of
a
police
testimony
in
that
case.
in
hester,
you
have
custody
in
the
middle
of
the
same
school
day.
his
interrogation
and
the
words
admitting
guilt
came
out
within
five
minutes.
there
was
a
45
minute
period
--
interview
period
proceeding
the
arrest.
he
was
detained
in
a
juvenile
home
and
left
alone
and
he
was
interviewed
by
two
officers,
no
relay.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
no
your
honor.
this
case
is
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
don't
want
to
speak
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well,
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well
your
honor
we
suggest
there
has
been
no
misapplication
of
the
law.
we
feel
that
the
law
that
applies
here
is
the
totality
of
circumstances
test.
in
1962,
this
court
in
gallegos
said
there
is
no
guide
for
the
cases
as
such
as
these
unless
it's
totality.
it
is
that
test
which
we
ask
this
court
to
apply
and
it
firmed
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
its
application
of
totality.
we
feel
that
there
is
nothing
inherently
coercive
about
the
period
of
custody
of
the
five
minutes
from
4:00
to
4:05
when
the
words
came
out.
in
hailey
and
gallegos,
there
is
a
suggestion
of
an
anonymous
casted
a
detention,
we
suggest
that
is
not
here,
it
cannot
be
fairly
said
about
this
case.
we
contend
that
when
viewing
this
in
the
totality
of
circumstances
test,
the
crucial
period
of
custody
was
only
five
minutes.
the
comparisons
with
hailey
and
gallegos
therefore
must
pale,
the
questioning
was
briefed,
it
indeed
unless
you
elevate
to
a
constitutional
status
to
claim
that
any
questioning
of
any
type
is
impermissible,
could
a
petitioner
succeed
in
casting
doubt
about
the
validity
of
the
the
state
was
made
to
him
during
the
interview.
as
to
the
age
and
condition
of
the
suspect,
we
fill
that
the
petitioner
while
admittedly
having
lagging
mental
achievement
when
reading
the
record
reflects
not
an
individual
whose
will
was
over
borne
within
the
five
minute
period
of
his
questioning.
we
suggest
there
has
been
--
that
the
calling
for
a
per
se
rule
in
this
case
which
maybe
supported
by
some
of
the
dictum
in
gallegos
would
do
great
harm
to
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
we
feel
that
if
hester's
case
came
up
today,
which
it
could
not
come
up
in
the
same
posture
because
of
miranda.
that
the
miranda
warnings
together
with
a
strict
application
of
the
totality
test
cause
no
new
rule
of
perse
to
be
established.
we
feel
for
this
case,
totality
is
the
only
test
that
totality
when
viewed
in
the
facts
in
light
of
this
case,
finds
this
case
not
wanting
or
full
of
the
inherent
coercion
found
in
the
hailey
and
gallegos
test.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
he
denies
your
honor,
at
no
point
that
he
challenged
anything
other
than
the
admissibility
of
the
confession.
i
suggest
that
the
lower
courts
which
have
had
occasion
to
apply
the
totality
rule
to
juveniles
have
not
found
it
an
impossible
test.
admittedly,
it's
a
heavier
burden.
admittedly,
the
circumstances
surrounding
it
must
be
found
to
be
--
if
there's
possible
most
grossly
scrutinized
than
in
an
adult
case.
and
we
feel
that
that
kind
of
scrutiny
took
place
in
this
case,
that
the
period
of
questioning
being
short,
the
lack
of
inherent
coercion,
the
fact
that
in
1961,
prosecution
authorities
had
hailey
to
hailey
to
upon.
had
hailey's
was
to
come
--
gallegos
was
to
come
that
they
acted
properly.
that
their
actions
are
those
of
professional
officers
seeking
to
solve
a
crime
admittedly
but
in
no
way
overboard
the
will
of
a
14
year
old
who
was
reluctant
to
confess.
your
honor,
the
testimony
of
all
police
officers
in
this
case
went
un-rebutted.
we
suggest
that
there
was
a
finding
even
by
justice
shafer's
dissent
of
no
criticism
of
the
action
of
the
officers
only
speaking
of
the
failure
to
prove
beyond
the
preponderance.
i
will
conclude
with
this
unless
the
court
has
other
question.
that
society
is
always
paid
and
this
is
a
quote
from
justice
harlan,
a
stiff
price
for
law
and
order
and
peaceful
interrogation
is
that
one
of
the
dark
moments
of
the
law.
we
feel
that
the
application
and
the
calling
for
the
per
se
rule,
number
one
is
totally
unwarranted
by
the
petitioner
that
the
facts
that
he
alleges
are
not
those
reflected
in
the
record.
and
those
reflected
in
the
record
do
not
cause
this
case
to
fall
under
totality.
thank
you.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
you
have
before
you
a
case
where
the
proof
of
guilt
we
suggest
is
overwhelming.
that
statement
we
make
in
consideration
even
if
the
confession
were
to
be
said
to
one
side.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes
he
did
your
honor.
yes
he
did.
and
we
feel
that
the
majority
in
the
opinion
reflected
by
mr.
chief
justice
underwood,
now
chief
justice
underwood
where
they
felt
a
scientific
evidence
was
so
overwhelming.
that
it
is
on
that
we
base
it
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
difficulty
at
first
in
rebuttal
is
that
counsel
for
the
respondent
find
it
very
difficult
to
recognize
this
case
from
the
facts
as
presented
by
the
petitioner.
but
before
i
make
any
reference
to
that,
let
me
just
say
that
the
petitioner
raised
the
host
of
points
in
this
petition
for
certiorari
in
brief.
we
feel
one
of
his
only
constitutional
dimension.
that
is
the
one
he
has
chose
and
argue
this
morning.
we
put
aside
those
others.
we
will
address
ourselves
to
the
confession.
in
1961,
the
petitioner
hester
was
14
years
old.
he
was
in
the
fifth
grade.
he
was
not
given
miranda
warnings
before
he
confessed
after
five
minutes
of
interrogation.
those
confessions
were
voluntarily
given
we
suggest
and
this
conviction
should
be
sustained.
if
we
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
61
your
honor.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
pre
miranda,
april
of
61
is
the
date
of
the
commission
of
the
crime,
the
conviction
is
october
of
'61.
mr.
joel
m.

hours

your

after
the
confession.
confession
was
signed
at
8
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well
your
honor,
we
suggest
that
this
is
the
situation,
1961,
what
did
the
prosecuting
authorities
of
cook
county
have
by
the
way
of
case
law
to
rely
upon.
there
was
no
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
excuse
me
your
honor?
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
i
understand
your
honor.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes
it
was.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
your
honor,
that
--
there
is
where
we
take
strong
exception
if
i
may.
there
is
no
abstract
in
this
case,
there
is
a
record.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
and
the
record
--
he
was
in
the
fifth
grade
your
honor.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
he
was
a
poor
reader.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well
your
honor,
the
test
that
hester
underwent
as
does
any
ghetto
youth
in
1961
and
hopefully
it's
different
today,
are
structured
for
white
urban
culture.
hester
can
be
best
judged
by
his
dialog
with
the
police
in
the
trial
transcript
here.
i
suggest
he
was
not
a
retiring
youth.
he
is
an
aggressive
youth,
that's
what
the
records
indicate
the
psychological
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
he
was
14
your
honor
and
he
only
reached
the
fifth
grade.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
there's
no
request
for
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well
your
honor,
if
i
may,
the
circumstances
to
that
confession
on
how
quickly
that
was
obtained.
there
was
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
there
were
none.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
no.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
hester
was
confronted
at
8
am
in
his
school
by
two
policeman.
after
being
questioned
and
interviewed
for
45
minutes
in
the
school
balcony
by
two
policeman,
he
was
taken
to
the
principals
office
or
a
sub
office.
in
that
sub
office,
no
interrogation
went
on.
there
was
no
admission
of
guilt
during
the
45
minute
interview
and
hester
says,
as
fast
as
they
ask
me
question,
i
gave
it
back
to
them.
that's
the
incompetent
shy
retiring
14-year
old
shown
by
counsel.
i
suggest
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
record
will
reflect.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
i
will
come
to
that.
the
next
period
your
honor,
he
stays
in
that
room
for
15
minutes
with
one
police
officer.
the
two
bring
him
to
a
sergeant
feliz,
he
remains
there
and
nothing
is
done.
two
policeman
transport
him
to
the
audi
juvenile
detention
home.
at
that
time
he
is
left
there
for
6
hours
from
10
to
4
in
custody
but
not
in
direct
police
custody.
he
has
never
--
under
the
supervision,
he
was
placed
in
an
infirmary
room
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
your
honor,
the
record
there
has
a
problem.
the
mother
testifies
that
two
officers
came
at
1:30
that
afternoon.
in
other
words,
within
a
few
hours
after
his
apprehension.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes
your
honor,
it
would
be
about
4
hours.
the
police
officers
testify
actually
that
they
came
a
half
hour
to
45
minutes
later.
2:30
to
3.
because
--
and
justice
shafer
points
this
out
in
his
dissent.
because
of
objections
by
both
sides,
the
actual
testimony
of
what
occurred
with
these
officers,
what
they
said
to
the
mother
and
what
the
mother
said
to
them
is
never
in
this
record
and
they
must
be
candid
about
that.
the
majority
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
concludes
that
if
the
officers
went
to
his
house
at
1:30
within
4
hours
after
his
arrest
and
before
any
confession
was
obtained,
they
went
to
inform
her.
but
the
record
is
not
clear
on
the
exact
language
used
and
so
i
don't
want
to
make
the
representation.
we
can
--
i
rely
only
on
our
state
supreme
court
and
that's
the
view
we
take,
that
they
went
to
inform
in
nearly
afternoon.
now,
he
is
left
alone
from
10
till
4.
i
say
left
alone
and
of
course
he
is
in
custody
of
the
audi
home
but
he
is
not
interrogated
in
any
way.
he
is
given
a
medical
examination
and
lunch.
at
4
o'clock,
4
officers
come.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
why
four
o'clock?
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
why
there
had
be
four
officers
at
the
scene?
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
why
there
were
four.
two
were
from
homicide,
two
--
i
don't
recall
the
exact
area
they
identified,
two
homicide
officers
in
the
city
of
chicago
working
there.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well,
at
4
o'clock,
they
come
--
the
four
officers
confront
this
boy
your
honor.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
all
by
himself
for
five
minutes.
and
then
the
two
of
the
four
officers
leave.
two
of
the
officers
revealed
to
hester
that
certain
lab
tests
were
conducted
at
an
intervening
10
am
to
4
pm
period,
and
they
showed
results
connecting
him
with
the
crime.
two
officers
leave
and
as
counsel
says,
one
of
the
officers
says
get
it
off
of
your
chest,
within
a
five
minute
period,
that's
all
i
described
occurs
in
a
five
minute
period.
hester
starts
to
make
a
statement.
it
is
admittedly
exculpatory.
he
calls
it
an
accident.
and
if
i
can
just
make
one
passing
mention
to
the
kind
of
individual,
we
suggest
hester
is,
and
how
he
should
be
viewed.
hester
later
continued
to
talk
to
the
officers
for
approximately
45
minutes.
at
5
o'clock,
given
a
medical
examination
and
left
alone.
so
we
have
--
within
5
minutes
of
the
initial
contact
with
the
officers
at
confession,
45
minutes
approximately
of
explanation
and
then
he's
left
alone,
and
an
assistant
states
attorney
comes
which
is
quite
often
a
practice
in
homicide
cases
in
cook
county
where
an
assistant
takes
the
formal
confession.
when
that
confession
was
taken,
corrections
were
made
by
hester.
this
is
the
kind
of
corrections
for
example,
he
made.
hester
would
suggest
where
he
had
said
"i
kicked
certain
books
going
into
the
book
room",
which
was
the
scene
of
the
murder.
hester
changed
them
to
"i
tripped
over
them."
i
think
the
reflection
shown
by
the
corrections
in
the
confession
which
are
contained
of
course
in
the
record,
belay
the
fact
that
we
have
the
kind
of
individual
suggested
by
the
petitioner
in
his
statement
of
facts.
the
early
45
minute
interview
in
the
school
produced
absolutely
no
admissions
by
hester.
and
he
made
the
statement
“as
fast
as
they
could
ask
me,
i
could
answer
the
questions”.
this
case
we
suggest
is
not
hailey.
in
hailey
your
honor,
is
what
the
state
of
illinois
had
to
rely
upon
in
1961.
in
hailey,
you
have
questioning
of
a
15
year
old
in
a
dead
of
night.
the
questioning
takes
5
hours.
there
is
a
detention
in
a
jail
not
a
juvenile
home.
there
is
relay
questionings
were
there
--
which
was
totally
absent
your
honors
in
hester.
there
is
a
suggestion
of
brutality
because
the
mother
testified
as
to
seeing
certain
evidences
of
blood
and
bruises,
and
i
believe
the
majority
opinion
suggests
that
there
is
a
discounting
of
a
police
testimony
in
that
case.
in
hester,
you
have
custody
in
the
middle
of
the
same
school
day.
his
interrogation
and
the
words
admitting
guilt
came
out
within
five
minutes.
there
was
a
45
minute
period
--
interview
period
proceeding
the
arrest.
he
was
detained
in
a
juvenile
home
and
left
alone
and
he
was
interviewed
by
two
officers,
no
relay.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
no
your
honor.
this
case
is
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
don't
want
to
speak
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well,
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well
your
honor
we
suggest
there
has
been
no
misapplication
of
the
law.
we
feel
that
the
law
that
applies
here
is
the
totality
of
circumstances
test.
in
1962,
this
court
in
gallegos
said
there
is
no
guide
for
the
cases
as
such
as
these
unless
it's
totality.
it
is
that
test
which
we
ask
this
court
to
apply
and
it
firmed
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
its
application
of
totality.
we
feel
that
there
is
nothing
inherently
coercive
about
the
period
of
custody
of
the
five
minutes
from
4:00
to
4:05
when
the
words
came
out.
in
hailey
and
gallegos,
there
is
a
suggestion
of
an
anonymous
casted
a
detention,
we
suggest
that
is
not
here,
it
cannot
be
fairly
said
about
this
case.
we
contend
that
when
viewing
this
in
the
totality
of
circumstances
test,
the
crucial
period
of
custody
was
only
five
minutes.
the
comparisons
with
hailey
and
gallegos
therefore
must
pale,
the
questioning
was
briefed,
it
indeed
unless
you
elevate
to
a
constitutional
status
to
claim
that
any
questioning
of
any
type
is
impermissible,
could
a
petitioner
succeed
in
casting
doubt
about
the
validity
of
the
the
state
was
made
to
him
during
the
interview.
as
to
the
age
and
condition
of
the
suspect,
we
fill
that
the
petitioner
while
admittedly
having
lagging
mental
achievement
when
reading
the
record
reflects
not
an
individual
whose
will
was
over
borne
within
the
five
minute
period
of
his
questioning.
we
suggest
there
has
been
--
that
the
calling
for
a
per
se
rule
in
this
case
which
maybe
supported
by
some
of
the
dictum
in
gallegos
would
do
great
harm
to
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
we
feel
that
if
hester's
case
came
up
today,
which
it
could
not
come
up
in
the
same
posture
because
of
miranda.
that
the
miranda
warnings
together
with
a
strict
application
of
the
totality
test
cause
no
new
rule
of
perse
to
be
established.
we
feel
for
this
case,
totality
is
the
only
test
that
totality
when
viewed
in
the
facts
in
light
of
this
case,
finds
this
case
not
wanting
or
full
of
the
inherent
coercion
found
in
the
hailey
and
gallegos
test.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
he
denies
your
honor,
at
no
point
that
he
challenged
anything
other
than
the
admissibility
of
the
confession.
i
suggest
that
the
lower
courts
which
have
had
occasion
to
apply
the
totality
rule
to
juveniles
have
not
found
it
an
impossible
test.
admittedly,
it's
a
heavier
burden.
admittedly,
the
circumstances
surrounding
it
must
be
found
to
be
--
if
there's
possible
most
grossly
scrutinized
than
in
an
adult
case.
and
we
feel
that
that
kind
of
scrutiny
took
place
in
this
case,
that
the
period
of
questioning
being
short,
the
lack
of
inherent
coercion,
the
fact
that
in
1961,
prosecution
authorities
had
hailey
to
hailey
to
upon.
had
hailey's
was
to
come
--
gallegos
was
to
come
that
they
acted
properly.
that
their
actions
are
those
of
professional
officers
seeking
to
solve
a
crime
admittedly
but
in
no
way
overboard
the
will
of
a
14
year
old
who
was
reluctant
to
confess.
your
honor,
the
testimony
of
all
police
officers
in
this
case
went
un-rebutted.
we
suggest
that
there
was
a
finding
even
by
justice
shafer's
dissent
of
no
criticism
of
the
action
of
the
officers
only
speaking
of
the
failure
to
prove
beyond
the
preponderance.
i
will
conclude
with
this
unless
the
court
has
other
question.
that
society
is
always
paid
and
this
is
a
quote
from
justice
harlan,
a
stiff
price
for
law
and
order
and
peaceful
interrogation
is
that
one
of
the
dark
moments
of
the
law.
we
feel
that
the
application
and
the
calling
for
the
per
se
rule,
number
one
is
totally
unwarranted
by
the
petitioner
that
the
facts
that
he
alleges
are
not
those
reflected
in
the
record.
and
those
reflected
in
the
record
do
not
cause
this
case
to
fall
under
totality.
thank
you.
