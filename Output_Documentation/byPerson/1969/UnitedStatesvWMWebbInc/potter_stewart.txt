mr.
solicitor
general,
as
i
read
this
now
under
your
guidance,
i
gather
that
we
come
right
down
with
respect
to
both
taxes
to
the
definition
of
employee
in
each
case,
don't
we?
in
other
words,
this
definition
of
unemployment
under
the
second
tax,
we
really
end
up
that
the
door
by
which
we're
heading,
it
doesn't
add
or
subtract
much
of
anything,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
test
of
the
definition
of
the
word
employee?
justice
potter
stewart
under
3121
(d)
and
under
--
justice

3301
(i),
(b)
(i).
justice
potter

thank
you.
justice

stewart
what
is
tenure
of
the
trips
typically?
is
it
just
one
day
trips?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
chance
that
the
crew
would
be
--
the
members
of
the
crew
would
be
employees
of
the
captain?
justice
potter
stewart
that
they'd
be
probable.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
if
they're
not
employees
of
these
respondents,
they
would
be
employees
of
the
captain,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
he
wouldn't
like
it,
i
suppose?
justice
potter
stewart
or
why
not
employees
of
the
captain?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know,
i
understand
that
but
why
does
it
follow
inevitably
if
they're
self
employed
if
they're
not
employees
of
these
respondents?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
are
there
the
same
maximums
with
respect
to
employees
as
exist
with
respect
to
self
employed
people?
it's
only
up
to
a
certain
amount
of
income
in
both
cases,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
same.
justice
potter
stewart
but
basically
the
same
benefit
--
ultimate
benefits?
