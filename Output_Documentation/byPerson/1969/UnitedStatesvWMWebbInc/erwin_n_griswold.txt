mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
tax
case
involving
the
application
of
the
social
security
old
age
tax
and
the
federal
unemployment
tax
to
the
owners
of
ships
with
respect
to
captains
and
crew
members
who
fish
off
the
south
atlantic
coast
and
the
gulf
of
mexico
for
manhattan.
manhattan
are
a
frequently
encountered
fish
which
is
not
regarded
as
edible
by
humans,
but
which
is
caught
in
large
quantities
and
processed
into
fish
meal
and
fish
oil
which
are
used
primarily
for
fertilizer
or
for
feeding
poultry
and
other
livestock.
the
case
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
statutory
provisions
involved
are
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief
at
pages
39
to
41.
before
stating
the
facts,
it
will
be
helpful
i
think
to
put
the
precise
terms
of
the
statute
before
the
court.
the
old
age
tax
is
imposed
by
section
3111
of
the
internal
revenue
code
and
is
in
terms
at
equal
to
the
following
percentage
of
the
wages
paid
by
him
with
respect
to
employment.
and
then
in
section
3121,
the
term
wages
is
defined.
now,
wages
means
all
remuneration
for
employment
and
then
in
3121
(d),
there
is
a
definition
of
the
term
employee
to
include
any
individual
who
under
the
usual
common
law
rules
applicable
in
determining
the
employer-employee
relationship
has
the
status
of
an
employee.
in
this
setting
out
in
our
brief
of
the
statutory
provisions,
we
omitted
one
at
this
point
which
may
have
some
conceivable
application.
it
is
in
section
3121
(b)
(4)
and
it
provides
that
employment
shall
not
include
services
performed
by
an
individual
on
or
in
connection
with
a
vessel,
not
an
american
vessel
or
in
connect
or
in
connection
with
an
aircraft,
not
an
american
aircraft,
if
(a)
the
individual
is
employed
on
and
in
connection
with
such
vessel
or
aircraft
went
outside
the
united
states
and
(b)
such
individual
is
not
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
or
the
employer
is
not
an
american
employer.
now,
that's
entirely
an
exclusionary
provision.
it
leaves
only
the
inference
that
it
was
intended
to
apply
to
american
citizens
employed
on
american
vessels
by
--
owned
by
american
owners
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
(b)
(4).
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
3121
(b)
(4)
contains
a
negative
pregnant
that
americans
employed
on
american
owned
vessels
are
covered.
i
would
say
as
mr.
lyman
will
remind
you
that
that
is
still
subject
to
the
definition
of
employment
or
employee
in
section
3121
(d).
now,
that's
the
old
age
tax,
there
is
also
an
unemployment
insurance
tax.
the
old
age
tax
you
will
recall
is
imposed
on
both
the
employer
and
the
employee
with
the
employer
under
obligation
to
withhold
the
employee's
share
and
pay
over
the
total
to
the
treasury.
the
unemployment
tax
is
imposed
only
on
the
employer
and
there
again,
it
is
imposed
at
a
percentage
of
the
total
wages
paid
by
him
during
the
calendar
year
with
respect
to
employment.
this
appears
on
page
40
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
the
term
wages
is
defined
to
mean
all
remuneration
for
employment.
and
again,
we
have
the
term
employment
defined
here
saying
there's
somewhat
more
complicated
manner.
employment
is
defined
as
any
service
performed
--
any
service
of
whatever
nature
performed
after
1954
by
an
employee
for
the
person
employing
him;
(b)
on
or
in
connection
with
an
american
vessel
and
then
you
come
to
the
end
of
that
at
the
top
of
page
41,
except
and
this
gets
very
involved
because
this
exception
i'm
about
to
state
is
then
subject
to
an
exception
itself,
except
service
performed
by
an
individual
in
or
as
an
officer
or
a
member
of
the
crew
of
a
vessel
while
it
is
engaged
in
the
catching,
harvesting,
cultivating
or
farming
of
any
kind
of
fish,
shellfish
and
so
on
and
here's
the
next
exception,
except
(b)
service
performed
on
or
in
connection
with
a
vessel
of
more
than
ten
tons.
so
they
take
out
all
fishing,
but
then
they
except
from
that
take
out
service
on
vessels
of
more
than
ten
tons.
and
all
of
the
vessels
involved
in
this
case
were
of
more
than
ten
tons
so
that
it
comes
within
the
exception
to
the
exception
and
thus
is
included
in
the
definition
of
employment.
but
again,
it's
subject
to
the
provision
in
section
3306
(i)
that
for
purposes
of
this
chapter,
the
term
employee
includes
an
officer
of
a
corporation,
but
does
not
include
any
individual
who
under
the
usual
common
law
rules
applicable
in
determining
the
employer-employee
relationship
has
the
status
of
an
independent
contractor
or
(2)
any
individual
who
is
not
an
employee
under
such
common
law
rules.
now,
that
is
the
statutory
setup.
it
is
part
of
a
large
whole
but
one
can
focus
rather
closely
on
those
provisions;
one
in
the
old
age
tax
and
one
in
the
unemployment
tax
which
--
by
which
congress
has
emphasized
that
the
test
of
employment
is
the
common
law
--
the
usual
common
law
rules
applicable
in
determining
the
employer-employee
relationship.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
--
i
think
that's
exactly
it
except
that
i
would
say
that
this
definition
comes
as
a
piece
of
a
mosaic
which
also
includes
some
references
to
fishing
and
ships
and
boats
of
more
than
ten
tons
and
thus,
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
exclude
employment
on
the
ship
such
as
are
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
i
fully
agree
that
a
large
part
of
the
problem
before
the
court
is
the
application
of
this
common
law
test
specified
in
the
statute
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
determining
whether
these
people
are
employees.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
3306
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
now,
this
case
was
tried
before
the
district
court
without
a
jury.
there
was
an
extensive
stipulation
of
facts.
there
were
also
depositions
and
evidence
on
all
of
which,
the
district
court
made
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
the
underlying
facts
are
essentially
not
in
dispute
and
they
maybe
summarized
as
follows.
the
fishing
involved
in
this
case
was
partly
in
the
south
atlantic
coast
and
partly
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
there
are
14
respondents
in
five
cases
which
were
consolidated
in
the
court
below.
each
owns
one
or
more
boats
which
fish
for
manhattan,
their
cost
varying
between
$24,000.00
and
$157,000.00.
in
other
words,
the
respondents
all
have
substantial
capital
invested
in
the
enterprise.
the
respondents
sell
the
fish
to
processing
plants.
the
respondents
who
not
only
own
the
boats,
keep
them
fully
equipped,
paid
for
all
their
repairs
and
paid
for
insurance
on
the
boats.
they
paid
for
fuel
for
the
boats,
all
of
the
fuel
for
the
boats.
the
method
of
operation
was
one
which
has
an
ancient
history
in
the
fishing
business.
it
seems
to
go
back
three
or
four
centuries
at
least.
it's
called
the
“lay
system.”
there
are
some
variations,
but
the
owner
of
the
boat
from
people
whom
he
knows
secures
the
services
of
an
experienced
fishermen
as
a
captain
of
the
vessel.
he
is
selected
because
of
his
honesty
and
experience
and
his
ability
to
enlist
and
organize
and
supervise
a
crew.
when
the
captain
has
been
chosen,
he
arranges
a
crew
and
here
i
would
like
to
turn
to
some
of
the
findings
of
the
district
court
so
that
there
can
be
no
suggestion
that
i
am
not
representing
the
facts
adequately.
finding
13
on
page
320
of
the
record,
the
arrangement
between
the
plaintiffs
and
each
captain
was
entirely
oral.
the
term
of
the
arrangement
was
not
specified,
but
it
was
understood
to
persist
for
a
fishing
season.
it
could
be
terminated
by
either
party
voluntarily
or
involuntarily
at
the
conclusion
of
any
trip
during
the
season.
that
seems
to
me
to
show
a
great
potentiality
for
a
control
by
the
boat
owners,
but
this
could
occur
only
when
a
boat
was
in
port
and
before
another
fishing
trip
was
commenced.
while
the
arrangement
could
be
so
terminated,
custom
and
practice
was
for
it
to
be
continued
for
the
season.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
inevitably
mr.
chief
justice
and
that
of
course
i
suppose
is
inherent
in
the
post
of
being
the
master
of
a
vessel
while
it
is
at
sea.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i
suppose
any
employee
ordinarily
can
quit
at
any
reasonable
time.
that
doesn't
negate
the
fact
that
he
is
an
employee.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
trips
were
ordinarily
one
day
in
the
gulf.
they
occasionally
were
longer
in
the
south
atlantic,
particularly
in
the
winter.
at
this
time,
there
were
not
refrigerated
ships
although
there
are
now
and
the
controlling
factor,
the
manhattan
being
quickly
perishable,
the
controlling
factor
was
the
temperature.
in
the
gulf,
the
temperature
is
always
high
and
the
trips
were
one
day.
the
evidence
shows
that
in
the
south
atlantic,
they
occasionally
lasted
three
or
four
days.
they
were
ordinarily
short
trips.
now
i
call
attention
to
finding
22
on
page
323.
in
negotiating
for
the
service
of
a
captain,
it
was
understood
that
the
captain
would
select
the
crew
members.
prior
to
commencement
of
a
new
season,
the
tax
payers
who
are
the
boat
owners
and
the
respondents
here
would
furnish
the
captain
with
the
pay
scale
of
crew
members
and
the
crew
size
to
be
employed
for
the
season.
if
a
bonus
was
to
be
paid
for
fishing
the
entire
season,
this
information
also
was
furnished
to
captains.
so
i
point
out
that
the
owners
here
fixed
the
--
i
can't
quite
say
the
rate
of
pay
because
under
the
lay
system,
the
men
are
paid
so
much
for
a
thousand
pounds
of
the
catch
but
they
fix
the
rate
per
thousand
pounds
that
the
men
were
to
be
paid.
and
then
i
call
attention
to
finding
24
on
page
324,
defendant
contended
and
the
plaintiff
denied
that
the
captain
was
required
to
pay
a
crew
member
not
less
than
the
scale
established
by
the
plaintiff.
the
testimony
of
the
various
captains
leave
no
doubt
that
the
plaintiff
not
only
fixed
the
pay
scale
of
the
crew,
but
also
the
number
of
the
crewmen
to
be
hired
and
finally
of
the
findings,
i
would
refer
to
finding
46
on
page
333.
the
plaintiffs
did
have
the
right
to
control
the
results
of
a
captain's
work
and
interfered
in
the
process
to
some
degree
to
assure
a
proper
result
from
the
undertaking.
next,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
evidence
is
clear
that
the
captains
were
required
to
obtain
from
each
crewman,
the
evidence
says
a
w-2
form,
but
the
w-2
form
is
the
one
by
which
you
report
to
the
individual
at
the
end
of
the
year
what
has
been
withheld.
it
is
actually
this
familiar
w-4
form
which
is
the
employee's
withholding
exemption
certificate
and
then
it
was
also
a
part
of
the
procedure
duly
established
and
carried
out
that
the
captains
at
the
end
of
each
trip
turned
in
the
data
with
respect
to
the
crewmen
showing
which
crewmen
had
served
and
what
the
amount
of
the
catch
had
been
and
what
the
rate
per
thousand
pounds
was
for
each
crewman.
and
in
our
reply
brief,
we
have
reproduced
exhibits
one
and
two
which
were
introduced
into
evidence
in
the
court
below
and
about
which
there
is
no
controversy
or
dispute.
these
show
that
for
each
individual,
what
is
headed
at
the
top
a
payroll
and
they
show
the
amount
of
fish
caught,
the
rate
for
each
man,
the
total
payment,
the
social
security
tax
withheld,
the
income
tax
withheld,
the
amount
deducted
for
each
individual
for
his
share
of
the
cost
of
food
because
the
crewmen
paid
for
the
food,
the
amount
deducted
for
advances
which
had
previously
been
made,
the
other
deductions
which
were
because
as
i
understand
it,
the
crewmen
paid
$5.00
each
to
provide
the
pay
of
the
cook
--
the
cook
being
thought
of
as
providing
their
meals
which
were
their
responsibility.
finally,
the
balance
and
then
also
at
the
bottom
of
the
second
sheet
of
exhibit
one
are
shown
the
other
checks
which
were
issued
which
included
payment
for
the
food
and
these
under
--
according
to
the
record
were
all
the
ship
owner's
checks,
the
respondent's
checks
here.
they
got
all
the
money
and
they
paid
all
the
bills.
and
finally,
exhibit
two
which
is
at
the
back
shows
the
individual
record
which
was
kept
for
each
member
of
the
crew,
again
showing
these
deductions
which
are
aggregated
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
for
the
whole
year
so
that
they
could
be
duly
reported
to
the
individual
on
the
form
w-2
the
amount
of
deductions
for
social
security
tax,
for
income
tax
and
for
other
matters.
now,
let
me
point
out
that
this
--
the
fact
that
this
case
is
here,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
an
instance
of
the
difficulty
we
sometimes
get
into
in
this
country
in
administering
relatively
simple
matters.
it
is
nearly
30
years
ago
that
the
treasury
issued
a
ruling
with
respect
to
this
situation
saying
that
captains
and
crewmen
operating
under
the
lay
system
are
employees
and
are
subject
to
the
social
security
tax.
this
is
sst
social
security
tax
387
which
was
published
in
the
accumulative
bulletin
for
1940
volume
1
and
this
is
cited
in
our
brief.
in
addition,
this
court
had
decided
cases
like
the
silt
case
in
331
us
which
involved
another
group
of
relatively
simple
workmen.
they
were
coal
unloaders
there.
they
furnished
their
own
picks
and
shovels.
in
this
case,
the
men
furnished
nothing
except
their
foul
weather
gear
which
would
be
boots
and
raincoats.
in
the
silt
case,
this
court
reversed
both
of
the
lower
courts
and
held
that
the
coal
unloaders
were
employees.
in
addition
to
the
silt
case,
there
are
of
course
many
cases
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now,
it
will
be
said
by
mr.
lyman
that
neither
the
silt
case
nor
sst
387
are
relevant
because
they
were
both
issued
before
the
congress
amended
the
statute
in
1948.
and
it
was
in
1948
that
congress
put
in
this
language
about
the
common
law
test
to
which
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
awhile
ago.
but
as
is
pointed
in
our
brief
at
the
time
that
congress
put
this
into
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
plainly
showed
that
congress
was
endorsing
the
silt
case.
it
referred
to
the
--
on
page
15
of
our
brief
is
a
quotation
from
the
senate
report.
in
the
view
of
your
committee,
these
decisions
affirm
that
the
usual
common
law
rules
realistically
applied
must
be
used
to
determine
whether
a
person
is
an
employee
for
purposes
of
applying
the
social
security
tax.
and
in
1950,
two
years
later
referring
to
the
situation,
the
house
--
the
conference
report
said
a
restricted
view
of
the
employer-employee
relationship
should
not
be
taken
in
the
administration
of
the
federal
old
age
and
survivors'
insurance
system
in
making
coverage
determinations.
so
i
find
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
language
of
the
statute
put
in
1948
was
intended
to
repeal
or
overrule
the
silt
case,
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
early
administrative
interpretation
should
not
be
followed.
i
would
point
out
that
we
are
here
dealing
with
a
maritime
employment.
we're
necessarily
concerned
with
the
customs
of
the
sea
and
the
law
of
the
sea.
under
the
law
of
the
sea
it's
perfectly
plain
that
this
captains
and
crewmen
would
be
entitled
to
maintenance
and
cure,
would
be
entitled
to
a
protection
under
the
jones
act.
the
proposition
that
captains
and
crews
under
the
lay
system
are
employees
for
purposes
of
the
social
security
taxes
has
been
accepted
by
the
court
of
claims
in
two
cases,
cited
at
page
37
of
our
brief.
one
involving
fishing
for
scallops
from
new
bedford
and
the
other
involving
fishing
for
shrimp
and
oysters
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
also
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
affirming
per
curiam
in
opinion
by
judge
genio
in
the
district
of
maine
involving
a
fishing
trawler
operating
out
of
portland,
maine.
the
only
problem
has
been
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
there
are
things
got
off
to
a
bad
start
in
enochs
against
the
williams
packing
and
navigation
company,
cited
on
page
37
of
our
brief.
that
was
a
suit
to
enjoin
the
collection
of
these
taxes
in
circumstances
essentially
the
same
as
those
here
and
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
enochs
case
allowed
the
injunction.
that
involved,
as
far
as
both
courts
were
concerned,
a
determination
that
these
people
were
not
employees.
when
the
case
came
here,
this
court
reversed,
holding
that
it
was
not
appropriate
to
disregard
the
statute
and
ignore
the
restriction
on
injunctions
against
the
collection
of
taxes,
but
there
is
that
left
standing
the
rest
of
the
fifth
circuit
decision.
and
in
the
crawford
packing
case,
cited
on
page
37
and
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
has
understandably
continued
to
follow
its
decision
in
the
enochs'
case,
otherwise
repudiated
by
this
court
that
these
people
were
not
employees.
now,
even
under
the
common
law
test,
even
if
it's
given
a
narrow
construction,
we
contend
that
these
captains
and
crewmen
came
within.
here,
all
of
the
capital
came
from
the
ship
owners.
they
owned
the
ships.
they
paid
for
their
repairs
and
for
their
fuel.
they
paid
for
the
nets
which
cost
some
$10,000.00.
all
the
men
provided
was
their
foul
weather
gear,
boots
and
slickers
and
the
like.
they
did
not
even
provide
picks
and
shovels
as
in
the
silt
case.
the
rate
of
compensation
of
the
captains
and
crews
was
fixed
by
the
owners.
the
size
of
the
crews
were
determined
by
the
owners.
the
captains
could
change
this,
but
only
at
the
expense
of
themselves
or
of
all
the
crew.
the
owners
were
the
entrepreneurs,
they
were
in
charge,
they
fixed
the
pay
scale.
the
owners
paid
the
bills.
they
were
the
only
ones
that
had
money
in
hand
for
the
purpose.
they
took
out
insurance
and
took
the
gain
of
the
price
when
fish
went
up
and
took
the
risk
of
loss.
they
were
clearly
in-charge
and
that
should
be
enough
when
the
statute
is
realistically
applied.
even
under
a
strict
view
of
the
common
law
test
and
when
this
question
arises
in
the
maritime
setting
as
it
does
here,
that
conclusion
becomes
even
more
clear.
there
are
three
ways
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case
can
be
decided;
one
is
practical
and
workable.
the
others
lead
only
to
uncertainty
and
confusion.
now
first,
the
court
can
hold
that
the
captains
and
the
crews
were
the
employee's
of
the
owners
thus
reversing
the
decision
below.
that's
what
the
parties
actually
did
here.
that
makes
the
social
security
system
realistic
and
workable
as
applied
to
these
workers
who
have
no
capital
investment,
no
management
of
the
enterprise.
that
puts
the
paperwork
of
withholding
and
tax
paying
work
and
practically
be
handled
as
it
was
handled
in
this
case.
or
second,
the
court
can
hold
that
the
captains
and
crews
are
not
employees
of
the
ship
owners.
that
would
eliminate
withholding
of
income
tax
under
of
worker's
share
old
age
tax
and
it
would
eliminate
payment
of
old
age
tax
and
unemployment
tax
by
the
owners.
this
can
be
set
forth.
people
would
know
where
they
stood,
but
it
would
mean
that
the
captains
and
the
crews
would
have
to
pay
their
income
tax
without
withholding
and
would
have
to
pay
self
employment
tax
at
an
increased
rate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
suppose
so,
i
don't
know.
there
is
some
suggestion
that
mr.
lyman
suggests
in
his
brief
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
that
they
would
be
self
employed
and
pay
their
own
tax
which
seems
to
me
to
be
quite
unrealistic.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
could
be
but
that
isn't
the
way
the
captain
thinks
of
it.
he
doesn't
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
maintain
employment
records
and
carry
on
relations
with
the
union
and
things
of
that
kind.
and
finally,
the
question
could
be
left
for
the
decision
of
the
trier
of
the
facts
in
each
case.
that
is
what
has
happened
so
far
in
the
fifth
circuit.
it
happened
for
example
in
the
enochs'
case
when
it
went
back
to
the
district
court
after
this
court's
decision
that
the
collection
of
the
tax
could
not
be
enjoined,
but
that
way
it's
chaos.
a
jury
verdict
establishes
no
rule.
it
would
not
bind
others
now
would
it
bind
the
same
parties
on
slightly
different
facts.
there
have
been
numerous
jury
verdicts
on
this
question
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
they
give
no
guidance
to
anyone.
that
approach
makes
it
impossible
for
the
treasury
to
administer
the
statute
in
a
fair
and
consistent
manner
and
makes
it
equally
impossible
for
boat
owners
or
captains
or
crew
members
to
know
what
their
responsibilities
are.
there's
no
dispute
as
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
most
of
the
facts
were
stipulated.
there
was
evidence
but
there's
no
contradiction
in
the
evidence.
though
we
would
have
put
some
of
the
matters
somewhat
differently,
the
government
accepts
the
findings
of
fact
made
by
the
district
court.
our
position
is
that
those
findings
lead
as
a
matter
of
law
to
the
conclusion
that
the
captains
and
crews
here
were
employees
of
the
owners
of
the
ships
who
provided
the
means
and
made
the
rules
and
took
the
money
and
paid
the
bills.
accordingly,
we
urge
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
tax
case
involving
the
application
of
the
social
security
old
age
tax
and
the
federal
unemployment
tax
to
the
owners
of
ships
with
respect
to
captains
and
crew
members
who
fish
off
the
south
atlantic
coast
and
the
gulf
of
mexico
for
manhattan.
manhattan
are
a
frequently
encountered
fish
which
is
not
regarded
as
edible
by
humans,
but
which
is
caught
in
large
quantities
and
processed
into
fish
meal
and
fish
oil
which
are
used
primarily
for
fertilizer
or
for
feeding
poultry
and
other
livestock.
the
case
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
statutory
provisions
involved
are
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief
at
pages
39
to
41.
before
stating
the
facts,
it
will
be
helpful
i
think
to
put
the
precise
terms
of
the
statute
before
the
court.
the
old
age
tax
is
imposed
by
section
3111
of
the
internal
revenue
code
and
is
in
terms
at
equal
to
the
following
percentage
of
the
wages
paid
by
him
with
respect
to
employment.
and
then
in
section
3121,
the
term
wages
is
defined.
now,
wages
means
all
remuneration
for
employment
and
then
in
3121
(d),
there
is
a
definition
of
the
term
employee
to
include
any
individual
who
under
the
usual
common
law
rules
applicable
in
determining
the
employer-employee
relationship
has
the
status
of
an
employee.
in
this
setting
out
in
our
brief
of
the
statutory
provisions,
we
omitted
one
at
this
point
which
may
have
some
conceivable
application.
it
is
in
section
3121
(b)
(4)
and
it
provides
that
employment
shall
not
include
services
performed
by
an
individual
on
or
in
connection
with
a
vessel,
not
an
american
vessel
or
in
connect
or
in
connection
with
an
aircraft,
not
an
american
aircraft,
if
(a)
the
individual
is
employed
on
and
in
connection
with
such
vessel
or
aircraft
went
outside
the
united
states
and
(b)
such
individual
is
not
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
or
the
employer
is
not
an
american
employer.
now,
that's
entirely
an
exclusionary
provision.
it
leaves
only
the
inference
that
it
was
intended
to
apply
to
american
citizens
employed
on
american
vessels
by
--
owned
by
american
owners
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
(b)
(4).
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
3121
(b)
(4)
contains
a
negative
pregnant
that
americans
employed
on
american
owned
vessels
are
covered.
i
would
say
as
mr.
lyman
will
remind
you
that
that
is
still
subject
to
the
definition
of
employment
or
employee
in
section
3121
(d).
now,
that's
the
old
age
tax,
there
is
also
an
unemployment
insurance
tax.
the
old
age
tax
you
will
recall
is
imposed
on
both
the
employer
and
the
employee
with
the
employer
under
obligation
to
withhold
the
employee's
share
and
pay
over
the
total
to
the
treasury.
the
unemployment
tax
is
imposed
only
on
the
employer
and
there
again,
it
is
imposed
at
a
percentage
of
the
total
wages
paid
by
him
during
the
calendar
year
with
respect
to
employment.
this
appears
on
page
40
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
the
term
wages
is
defined
to
mean
all
remuneration
for
employment.
and
again,
we
have
the
term
employment
defined
here
saying
there's
somewhat
more
complicated
manner.
employment
is
defined
as
any
service
performed
--
any
service
of
whatever
nature
performed
after
1954
by
an
employee
for
the
person
employing
him;
(b)
on
or
in
connection
with
an
american
vessel
and
then
you
come
to
the
end
of
that
at
the
top
of
page
41,
except
and
this
gets
very
involved
because
this
exception
i'm
about
to
state
is
then
subject
to
an
exception
itself,
except
service
performed
by
an
individual
in
or
as
an
officer
or
a
member
of
the
crew
of
a
vessel
while
it
is
engaged
in
the
catching,
harvesting,
cultivating
or
farming
of
any
kind
of
fish,
shellfish
and
so
on
and
here's
the
next
exception,
except
(b)
service
performed
on
or
in
connection
with
a
vessel
of
more
than
ten
tons.
so
they
take
out
all
fishing,
but
then
they
except
from
that
take
out
service
on
vessels
of
more
than
ten
tons.
and
all
of
the
vessels
involved
in
this
case
were
of
more
than
ten
tons
so
that
it
comes
within
the
exception
to
the
exception
and
thus
is
included
in
the
definition
of
employment.
but
again,
it's
subject
to
the
provision
in
section
3306
(i)
that
for
purposes
of
this
chapter,
the
term
employee
includes
an
officer
of
a
corporation,
but
does
not
include
any
individual
who
under
the
usual
common
law
rules
applicable
in
determining
the
employer-employee
relationship
has
the
status
of
an
independent
contractor
or
(2)
any
individual
who
is
not
an
employee
under
such
common
law
rules.
now,
that
is
the
statutory
setup.
it
is
part
of
a
large
whole
but
one
can
focus
rather
closely
on
those
provisions;
one
in
the
old
age
tax
and
one
in
the
unemployment
tax
which
--
by
which
congress
has
emphasized
that
the
test
of
employment
is
the
common
law
--
the
usual
common
law
rules
applicable
in
determining
the
employer-employee
relationship.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
--
i
think
that's
exactly
it
except
that
i
would
say
that
this
definition
comes
as
a
piece
of
a
mosaic
which
also
includes
some
references
to
fishing
and
ships
and
boats
of
more
than
ten
tons
and
thus,
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
exclude
employment
on
the
ship
such
as
are
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
i
fully
agree
that
a
large
part
of
the
problem
before
the
court
is
the
application
of
this
common
law
test
specified
in
the
statute
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
determining
whether
these
people
are
employees.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
3306
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
now,
this
case
was
tried
before
the
district
court
without
a
jury.
there
was
an
extensive
stipulation
of
facts.
there
were
also
depositions
and
evidence
on
all
of
which,
the
district
court
made
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
the
underlying
facts
are
essentially
not
in
dispute
and
they
maybe
summarized
as
follows.
the
fishing
involved
in
this
case
was
partly
in
the
south
atlantic
coast
and
partly
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
there
are
14
respondents
in
five
cases
which
were
consolidated
in
the
court
below.
each
owns
one
or
more
boats
which
fish
for
manhattan,
their
cost
varying
between
$24,000.00
and
$157,000.00.
in
other
words,
the
respondents
all
have
substantial
capital
invested
in
the
enterprise.
the
respondents
sell
the
fish
to
processing
plants.
the
respondents
who
not
only
own
the
boats,
keep
them
fully
equipped,
paid
for
all
their
repairs
and
paid
for
insurance
on
the
boats.
they
paid
for
fuel
for
the
boats,
all
of
the
fuel
for
the
boats.
the
method
of
operation
was
one
which
has
an
ancient
history
in
the
fishing
business.
it
seems
to
go
back
three
or
four
centuries
at
least.
it's
called
the
“lay
system.”
there
are
some
variations,
but
the
owner
of
the
boat
from
people
whom
he
knows
secures
the
services
of
an
experienced
fishermen
as
a
captain
of
the
vessel.
he
is
selected
because
of
his
honesty
and
experience
and
his
ability
to
enlist
and
organize
and
supervise
a
crew.
when
the
captain
has
been
chosen,
he
arranges
a
crew
and
here
i
would
like
to
turn
to
some
of
the
findings
of
the
district
court
so
that
there
can
be
no
suggestion
that
i
am
not
representing
the
facts
adequately.
finding
13
on
page
320
of
the
record,
the
arrangement
between
the
plaintiffs
and
each
captain
was
entirely
oral.
the
term
of
the
arrangement
was
not
specified,
but
it
was
understood
to
persist
for
a
fishing
season.
it
could
be
terminated
by
either
party
voluntarily
or
involuntarily
at
the
conclusion
of
any
trip
during
the
season.
that
seems
to
me
to
show
a
great
potentiality
for
a
control
by
the
boat
owners,
but
this
could
occur
only
when
a
boat
was
in
port
and
before
another
fishing
trip
was
commenced.
while
the
arrangement
could
be
so
terminated,
custom
and
practice
was
for
it
to
be
continued
for
the
season.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
inevitably
mr.
chief
justice
and
that
of
course
i
suppose
is
inherent
in
the
post
of
being
the
master
of
a
vessel
while
it
is
at
sea.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i
suppose
any
employee
ordinarily
can
quit
at
any
reasonable
time.
that
doesn't
negate
the
fact
that
he
is
an
employee.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
trips
were
ordinarily
one
day
in
the
gulf.
they
occasionally
were
longer
in
the
south
atlantic,
particularly
in
the
winter.
at
this
time,
there
were
not
refrigerated
ships
although
there
are
now
and
the
controlling
factor,
the
manhattan
being
quickly
perishable,
the
controlling
factor
was
the
temperature.
in
the
gulf,
the
temperature
is
always
high
and
the
trips
were
one
day.
the
evidence
shows
that
in
the
south
atlantic,
they
occasionally
lasted
three
or
four
days.
they
were
ordinarily
short
trips.
now
i
call
attention
to
finding
22
on
page
323.
in
negotiating
for
the
service
of
a
captain,
it
was
understood
that
the
captain
would
select
the
crew
members.
prior
to
commencement
of
a
new
season,
the
tax
payers
who
are
the
boat
owners
and
the
respondents
here
would
furnish
the
captain
with
the
pay
scale
of
crew
members
and
the
crew
size
to
be
employed
for
the
season.
if
a
bonus
was
to
be
paid
for
fishing
the
entire
season,
this
information
also
was
furnished
to
captains.
so
i
point
out
that
the
owners
here
fixed
the
--
i
can't
quite
say
the
rate
of
pay
because
under
the
lay
system,
the
men
are
paid
so
much
for
a
thousand
pounds
of
the
catch
but
they
fix
the
rate
per
thousand
pounds
that
the
men
were
to
be
paid.
and
then
i
call
attention
to
finding
24
on
page
324,
defendant
contended
and
the
plaintiff
denied
that
the
captain
was
required
to
pay
a
crew
member
not
less
than
the
scale
established
by
the
plaintiff.
the
testimony
of
the
various
captains
leave
no
doubt
that
the
plaintiff
not
only
fixed
the
pay
scale
of
the
crew,
but
also
the
number
of
the
crewmen
to
be
hired
and
finally
of
the
findings,
i
would
refer
to
finding
46
on
page
333.
the
plaintiffs
did
have
the
right
to
control
the
results
of
a
captain's
work
and
interfered
in
the
process
to
some
degree
to
assure
a
proper
result
from
the
undertaking.
next,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
evidence
is
clear
that
the
captains
were
required
to
obtain
from
each
crewman,
the
evidence
says
a
w-2
form,
but
the
w-2
form
is
the
one
by
which
you
report
to
the
individual
at
the
end
of
the
year
what
has
been
withheld.
it
is
actually
this
familiar
w-4
form
which
is
the
employee's
withholding
exemption
certificate
and
then
it
was
also
a
part
of
the
procedure
duly
established
and
carried
out
that
the
captains
at
the
end
of
each
trip
turned
in
the
data
with
respect
to
the
crewmen
showing
which
crewmen
had
served
and
what
the
amount
of
the
catch
had
been
and
what
the
rate
per
thousand
pounds
was
for
each
crewman.
and
in
our
reply
brief,
we
have
reproduced
exhibits
one
and
two
which
were
introduced
into
evidence
in
the
court
below
and
about
which
there
is
no
controversy
or
dispute.
these
show
that
for
each
individual,
what
is
headed
at
the
top
a
payroll
and
they
show
the
amount
of
fish
caught,
the
rate
for
each
man,
the
total
payment,
the
social
security
tax
withheld,
the
income
tax
withheld,
the
amount
deducted
for
each
individual
for
his
share
of
the
cost
of
food
because
the
crewmen
paid
for
the
food,
the
amount
deducted
for
advances
which
had
previously
been
made,
the
other
deductions
which
were
because
as
i
understand
it,
the
crewmen
paid
$5.00
each
to
provide
the
pay
of
the
cook
--
the
cook
being
thought
of
as
providing
their
meals
which
were
their
responsibility.
finally,
the
balance
and
then
also
at
the
bottom
of
the
second
sheet
of
exhibit
one
are
shown
the
other
checks
which
were
issued
which
included
payment
for
the
food
and
these
under
--
according
to
the
record
were
all
the
ship
owner's
checks,
the
respondent's
checks
here.
they
got
all
the
money
and
they
paid
all
the
bills.
and
finally,
exhibit
two
which
is
at
the
back
shows
the
individual
record
which
was
kept
for
each
member
of
the
crew,
again
showing
these
deductions
which
are
aggregated
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
for
the
whole
year
so
that
they
could
be
duly
reported
to
the
individual
on
the
form
w-2
the
amount
of
deductions
for
social
security
tax,
for
income
tax
and
for
other
matters.
now,
let
me
point
out
that
this
--
the
fact
that
this
case
is
here,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
an
instance
of
the
difficulty
we
sometimes
get
into
in
this
country
in
administering
relatively
simple
matters.
it
is
nearly
30
years
ago
that
the
treasury
issued
a
ruling
with
respect
to
this
situation
saying
that
captains
and
crewmen
operating
under
the
lay
system
are
employees
and
are
subject
to
the
social
security
tax.
this
is
sst
social
security
tax
387
which
was
published
in
the
accumulative
bulletin
for
1940
volume
1
and
this
is
cited
in
our
brief.
in
addition,
this
court
had
decided
cases
like
the
silt
case
in
331
us
which
involved
another
group
of
relatively
simple
workmen.
they
were
coal
unloaders
there.
they
furnished
their
own
picks
and
shovels.
in
this
case,
the
men
furnished
nothing
except
their
foul
weather
gear
which
would
be
boots
and
raincoats.
in
the
silt
case,
this
court
reversed
both
of
the
lower
courts
and
held
that
the
coal
unloaders
were
employees.
in
addition
to
the
silt
case,
there
are
of
course
many
cases
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now,
it
will
be
said
by
mr.
lyman
that
neither
the
silt
case
nor
sst
387
are
relevant
because
they
were
both
issued
before
the
congress
amended
the
statute
in
1948.
and
it
was
in
1948
that
congress
put
in
this
language
about
the
common
law
test
to
which
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
awhile
ago.
but
as
is
pointed
in
our
brief
at
the
time
that
congress
put
this
into
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
plainly
showed
that
congress
was
endorsing
the
silt
case.
it
referred
to
the
--
on
page
15
of
our
brief
is
a
quotation
from
the
senate
report.
in
the
view
of
your
committee,
these
decisions
affirm
that
the
usual
common
law
rules
realistically
applied
must
be
used
to
determine
whether
a
person
is
an
employee
for
purposes
of
applying
the
social
security
tax.
and
in
1950,
two
years
later
referring
to
the
situation,
the
house
--
the
conference
report
said
a
restricted
view
of
the
employer-employee
relationship
should
not
be
taken
in
the
administration
of
the
federal
old
age
and
survivors'
insurance
system
in
making
coverage
determinations.
so
i
find
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
language
of
the
statute
put
in
1948
was
intended
to
repeal
or
overrule
the
silt
case,
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
early
administrative
interpretation
should
not
be
followed.
i
would
point
out
that
we
are
here
dealing
with
a
maritime
employment.
we're
necessarily
concerned
with
the
customs
of
the
sea
and
the
law
of
the
sea.
under
the
law
of
the
sea
it's
perfectly
plain
that
this
captains
and
crewmen
would
be
entitled
to
maintenance
and
cure,
would
be
entitled
to
a
protection
under
the
jones
act.
the
proposition
that
captains
and
crews
under
the
lay
system
are
employees
for
purposes
of
the
social
security
taxes
has
been
accepted
by
the
court
of
claims
in
two
cases,
cited
at
page
37
of
our
brief.
one
involving
fishing
for
scallops
from
new
bedford
and
the
other
involving
fishing
for
shrimp
and
oysters
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
also
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
affirming
per
curiam
in
opinion
by
judge
genio
in
the
district
of
maine
involving
a
fishing
trawler
operating
out
of
portland,
maine.
the
only
problem
has
been
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
there
are
things
got
off
to
a
bad
start
in
enochs
against
the
williams
packing
and
navigation
company,
cited
on
page
37
of
our
brief.
that
was
a
suit
to
enjoin
the
collection
of
these
taxes
in
circumstances
essentially
the
same
as
those
here
and
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
enochs
case
allowed
the
injunction.
that
involved,
as
far
as
both
courts
were
concerned,
a
determination
that
these
people
were
not
employees.
when
the
case
came
here,
this
court
reversed,
holding
that
it
was
not
appropriate
to
disregard
the
statute
and
ignore
the
restriction
on
injunctions
against
the
collection
of
taxes,
but
there
is
that
left
standing
the
rest
of
the
fifth
circuit
decision.
and
in
the
crawford
packing
case,
cited
on
page
37
and
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
has
understandably
continued
to
follow
its
decision
in
the
enochs'
case,
otherwise
repudiated
by
this
court
that
these
people
were
not
employees.
now,
even
under
the
common
law
test,
even
if
it's
given
a
narrow
construction,
we
contend
that
these
captains
and
crewmen
came
within.
here,
all
of
the
capital
came
from
the
ship
owners.
they
owned
the
ships.
they
paid
for
their
repairs
and
for
their
fuel.
they
paid
for
the
nets
which
cost
some
$10,000.00.
all
the
men
provided
was
their
foul
weather
gear,
boots
and
slickers
and
the
like.
they
did
not
even
provide
picks
and
shovels
as
in
the
silt
case.
the
rate
of
compensation
of
the
captains
and
crews
was
fixed
by
the
owners.
the
size
of
the
crews
were
determined
by
the
owners.
the
captains
could
change
this,
but
only
at
the
expense
of
themselves
or
of
all
the
crew.
the
owners
were
the
entrepreneurs,
they
were
in
charge,
they
fixed
the
pay
scale.
the
owners
paid
the
bills.
they
were
the
only
ones
that
had
money
in
hand
for
the
purpose.
they
took
out
insurance
and
took
the
gain
of
the
price
when
fish
went
up
and
took
the
risk
of
loss.
they
were
clearly
in-charge
and
that
should
be
enough
when
the
statute
is
realistically
applied.
even
under
a
strict
view
of
the
common
law
test
and
when
this
question
arises
in
the
maritime
setting
as
it
does
here,
that
conclusion
becomes
even
more
clear.
there
are
three
ways
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case
can
be
decided;
one
is
practical
and
workable.
the
others
lead
only
to
uncertainty
and
confusion.
now
first,
the
court
can
hold
that
the
captains
and
the
crews
were
the
employee's
of
the
owners
thus
reversing
the
decision
below.
that's
what
the
parties
actually
did
here.
that
makes
the
social
security
system
realistic
and
workable
as
applied
to
these
workers
who
have
no
capital
investment,
no
management
of
the
enterprise.
that
puts
the
paperwork
of
withholding
and
tax
paying
work
and
practically
be
handled
as
it
was
handled
in
this
case.
or
second,
the
court
can
hold
that
the
captains
and
crews
are
not
employees
of
the
ship
owners.
that
would
eliminate
withholding
of
income
tax
under
of
worker's
share
old
age
tax
and
it
would
eliminate
payment
of
old
age
tax
and
unemployment
tax
by
the
owners.
this
can
be
set
forth.
people
would
know
where
they
stood,
but
it
would
mean
that
the
captains
and
the
crews
would
have
to
pay
their
income
tax
without
withholding
and
would
have
to
pay
self
employment
tax
at
an
increased
rate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
suppose
so,
i
don't
know.
there
is
some
suggestion
that
mr.
lyman
suggests
in
his
brief
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
that
they
would
be
self
employed
and
pay
their
own
tax
which
seems
to
me
to
be
quite
unrealistic.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
could
be
but
that
isn't
the
way
the
captain
thinks
of
it.
he
doesn't
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
maintain
employment
records
and
carry
on
relations
with
the
union
and
things
of
that
kind.
and
finally,
the
question
could
be
left
for
the
decision
of
the
trier
of
the
facts
in
each
case.
that
is
what
has
happened
so
far
in
the
fifth
circuit.
it
happened
for
example
in
the
enochs'
case
when
it
went
back
to
the
district
court
after
this
court's
decision
that
the
collection
of
the
tax
could
not
be
enjoined,
but
that
way
it's
chaos.
a
jury
verdict
establishes
no
rule.
it
would
not
bind
others
now
would
it
bind
the
same
parties
on
slightly
different
facts.
there
have
been
numerous
jury
verdicts
on
this
question
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
they
give
no
guidance
to
anyone.
that
approach
makes
it
impossible
for
the
treasury
to
administer
the
statute
in
a
fair
and
consistent
manner
and
makes
it
equally
impossible
for
boat
owners
or
captains
or
crew
members
to
know
what
their
responsibilities
are.
there's
no
dispute
as
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
most
of
the
facts
were
stipulated.
there
was
evidence
but
there's
no
contradiction
in
the
evidence.
though
we
would
have
put
some
of
the
matters
somewhat
differently,
the
government
accepts
the
findings
of
fact
made
by
the
district
court.
our
position
is
that
those
findings
lead
as
a
matter
of
law
to
the
conclusion
that
the
captains
and
crews
here
were
employees
of
the
owners
of
the
ships
who
provided
the
means
and
made
the
rules
and
took
the
money
and
paid
the
bills.
accordingly,
we
urge
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
