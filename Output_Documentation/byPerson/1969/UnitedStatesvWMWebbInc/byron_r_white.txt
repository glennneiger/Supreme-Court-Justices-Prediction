do
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me.
do
you
contend
the
conclusion
of
the
finding
of
no
employment
relationship
is
a
finding
of
fact
subject
to
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
or
is
it
a
legal
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it
is?
what
about
on
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
that
means
is
that
the
court
accepts
the
historical
facts
found
unless
they're
clearly
erroneous,
but
then
it's
a
question
of
law
as
to
whether
they
meet
the
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
no
clearly
erroneous
rule
in
reviewing
that
conclusion
of
the
fact.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
provision,
you
mean
groceries
and
foods?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
those
were
deducted
from
his
share
of
the
take?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
old
--
if
no
fish
were
caught,
the
captain
was
out
at
the
groceries?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
took
the
risk
of
loss
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--in
this
enterprise?
justice
byron
r.
white
only
for
the
groceries?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
fuel
and
other
things
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
captain
--
and
also,
i
suppose
that
the
--
that
the
--
well,
the
crew
members
were
paid
also
when
the
fish
were
caught
weren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
yes
but
only
if
fish
--
he
didn't
owe
them
anything
unless
they
caught
some
fish?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
the
owner?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
the
owner
sold
to
the
plant.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you

justice
byron

white
excuse

do
you
