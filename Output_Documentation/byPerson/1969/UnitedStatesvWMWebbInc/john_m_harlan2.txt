it
turns
out
that
the
standard
should
be
the
maritime
standard
and
not
the
technical
common

standard.
do
you
disagree
with
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
premise,
the
case
would
go
against
you?
justice
john

said
that
flatly,
didn't
it?
justice

so
that
really
what
this
case
all
boils
down
to
in
the
last
analysis
is
in
what
sense
common
law
was
used
in
the
statute,
whether
in
a
technical
common
law
sense
as
distinguished
common
law
from
equity

whether
common
law
in
the

that
general

as
opposed
to

free
willing
operation
