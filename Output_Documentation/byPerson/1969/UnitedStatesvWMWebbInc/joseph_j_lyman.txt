mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondents
say
that
the
only
question
of
substance
here
is
whether
the
concurrent
findings
of
fact
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
below
are
amply
supported
by
the
record.
and
whether
those
courts
applied
the
proper
legal
standards
in
reaching
the
conclusion
of
law
or
whether
the
findings
and
conclusions
are
clearly
erroneous.
now,
these
cases
are
suits
for
refund
of
federal
employment
taxes
erroneously
paid
on
the
earnings
of
certain
fishermen
who
used
and
operated
the
respondent's
manhattan
vessels.
now,
the
sole--
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
a
mixed
question
of
law
in
fact
i
believe
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
on
review
that
where
a
statute
would
preclude
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
i
would
say
that
would
be
a
question
of
law
and
reviewable
on
appeal
where
the
statute
would
preclude
the
decision.
however,
where
fact
elements
are
concerned
in
this
mixed
question,
the
reviewing
courts
are
bound
by
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
and
a
reviewing
court
will
set
aside
a
trial
court's
decision
only
when
the
facts
found
fall
short
at
meeting
the
statutory
requirements.
i
believe
that
was
this
court's
ruling
in
trust
of
bingham
--
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be
there,
no
your
honor,
that's
correct.
well,
the
sole
issue
before
the
district
court
was
whether
the
boat
owners,
also
the
respondents
here
reliable
for
the
excise
tax
portion
of
the
employment
taxes
imposed
on
their
earnings
of
the
fishermen
and
that's
the
captains
and
the
crewmen.
now,
the
respondent's
liability
or
non-liability
for
these
taxes
depended
upon
the
definition
of
the
term
employee
and
that
term
is
defined
in
two
sections
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
both
of
which
adopt
the
common
law
control
test.
now,
the
trial
court
held
that
the
tax
per
owners
had
proved
their
claims
for
refund
and
as
a
consequence,
the
fishermen
were
not
their
employees
under
those
statutes,
for
other
purposes
it
may
have
been,
but
under
those
statutes,
they
weren't.
now,
the
trial
court
resolved
all
issues
under
these
statutes.
all
issues
of
facts
in
favor
to
the
boat
owners
and
particularly,
those
issues
as
to
the
absence
of
control
over
the
manner
and
method
in
which
the
work
was
done.
now,
the
circuit
court
refused
to
set
aside
the
trial
court's
findings
and
conclusions
since
they
were
the
result
of
a
choice
between
two
permissible
views
of
the
weight
of
the
evidence
and
held
they
were
not
clearly
erroneous.
now,
the
district
court
made
51
separately
numbered
detailed
findings
and
covering
about
19
pages
of
this
record.
briefly,
i
would
say
the
needle
points
as
far
as
our
presentation
is
concerned
would
be
this.
the
respondents
were
owners
of
manhattan
boats.
they
equipped
and
maintained
them,
repaired
them
for
commercial
fishing
purposes.
they
contracted
with
the
captains
to
gather
the
fish.
now,
an
owner
would
relinquish
complete
control
of
that
boat
to
a
captain.
the
captain
would
then
staff
it
with
his
own
crew,
his
own
organization
which
consisted
of
mast
to
bow
mates
engineers,
pilots,
experienced
net
man,
and
a
cook
or
maybe
two.
the
captain
will
then
provision
the
boat
at
his
own
expense
and
anyway
that
he
saw
fit
and
all
of
these
was
without
any
interference
by
the
owners.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
groceries,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
no,
he
paid
those
out
of
his
own
pocket.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
oh,
yes.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
that's
right.
many
times
that's
happened.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
yes
your
honor
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
groceries
or
that
would
be
all.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
no,
those
were
all
paid
by
the
owners.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
your
honor,
just
to
bring
that
up,
the
crew
members
are
paid
out
of
the
pocket
of
the
captain.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
that's
correct.
i
want
to
correct
one
--
correct
--
just
want
to
give
my
view
of
mr.
griswold's
statement
that
this
was
a
lay
system.
this
wasn't
a
lay
system
at
all.
this
was
a
pure
sale.
in
other
words,
when
a
fish
boat
came
in
and
the
captain
came
in
with
a
large
catch,
he
sold
that
--
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
to
the
owner.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
the
owner
and
the
plant
had
another
arrangement
or
some
kind.
the
plant
was
not
a
party
to
this
suit
and
it's
important
that
the
plant
was
not
a
party
to
this
suit
because
in
one
of
these
findings
which
mr.
griswold
mentioned,
he
said
that
the
respondents
made
a
payroll
record,
that
wasn't
so.
the
plant
made
up
his
payroll
records.
the
plant
was
in
the
middle
acting
as
agent
you
might
say
for
the
captain
and
also
for
the
owners
because
it
was
to
the
plant's
interest
to
get
as
many
of
these
people
to
bring
fish
in
as
possible.
well
anyway,
the
captain
agreed
without
a
guarantee
of
any
kind
to
make
fishing
trips
for
a
season
and
return
the
catches
to
the
plants
that
were
owned
by
the
parties
who
were
not
parties
to
this
suit.
now,
the
price
that
the
owner
paid
to
the
captain
was
agreed
upon
between
the
owner
and
the
captain
and
this
was
if
the
court
please,
a
bilateral
decision
after
negotiations.
this
wasn't
something
i
said
i'm
going
to
give
you
this
much
and
that's
all
you
get,
this
was
a
give
and
take
proposition.
the
prices
differed
with
the
seasons
and
even
differed
among
owners
and
captains.
but
once
a
price
was
fixed
for
a
season,
it
remained
that
price
during
that
season.
now,
there
was
nothing
in
the
arrangements
which
indicated
that
a
captain
would
be
offered
a
boat
beyond
a
single
season
or
that
he
would
promise
a
fisher
boat
for
anybody
else
beyond
the
single
season.
there
is
no
connotative
relationship
here
in
any
meaningful
sense.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
yes,
i
would
say
that
it
was
contemplated
here
that
they
would
take
it
for
the
season
which
was
about
four
to
five
months
or
six
months
depending
where
they
were.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
yes,
but
as
a
practical
matter
if
the
court
please,
if
the
boat
is
equipped
and
ready
to
go
and
there
are
plenty
of
fish
out
there
and
the
captain
has
his
organization,
i
cannot
imagine
that
an
owner
would
just
willy
nilly
fire
a
captain
and
leave
a
profitable
venture
sitting
at
the
dock.
if
any
one
is
going
to
quit,
it
would
be
the
captain.
of
course
if
the
fish
disappeared
or
captain
fell
ill,
of
course
that
might
end
the
voyage.
but
the
owner,
he
hoped
and
prayed
the
captain
would
stay
and
he
had
a
good
crew
and
that
he
wouldn't
lose
the
crew.
now,
these
captains
were
free
to
perform
these
services
for
any
boat
owner
anywhere
at
anytime.
there
was
no
suggestion
if
the
owners
had
a
preferred
call
and
the
time
or
efforts
of
these
captains.
now,
the
crew
was
hired
and
paid
by
the
captains.
now,
the
compensation
paid
to
the
crew
came
solely
out
of
the
pocket
of
the
captain
and
if
there
was
a
catch,
mr.
justice
white,
the
proceeds
of
that
sale
became
the
captain's
money.
there's
no
lay
system
here.
it
was
then
divided
among
the
crew
in
accordance
with
the
prior
arrangements
with
the
captain
and
the
crew.
if
there
was
no
catch
as
you
say
then
no
one
is
paid.
now
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
record
of
a
union
contract
involved
at
all
or
bargaining
agents
between
any
of
the
parties.
each
captain
dealt
with
each
owner
on
an
individual
basis
and
each
crewman
dealt
with
each
captain
on
an
individual
basis.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
your
honor,
the
amount
of
money
was
issued
in
a
pay
scale
by
the
owners.
now,
the
district
court
said
nothing
more
than
that,
but
i
attribute
that
your
honor
to
the
owner's
control
over
the
result
of
this
enterprise
because
if
somebody
didn't
do
something
to
stabilize
what
these
men
would
get
in
a
plant
area,
there'd
be
chaos.
they
would
be
raiding
each
others'
crews'
right
in
the
--
right
down
at
the
dock.
so
--
and
that
has
happened
many
times.
so
to
avoid
that,
the
captains
actually
and
the
owners
would
get
together
and
it
may
violate
anti
trust
laws
but
they
would
fix
that
price
that
these
crews
would
get.
and
then
once
the
crews
were
fixed,
i
think
there's
a
finding
which
states
that
the
captain
had
discretion
to
vary
that
once
he
was
out,
but
that
was
the
purpose
of
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
the
owners--
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
pardon?
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
the
captain
hires
the
crew
entirely.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
no
your
honor,
absolutely
not.
that
was
specifically
found.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
well,
the
court
so
found
and
it
has
never
happened.
i
mean,
the
owner
now
cannot
fire
any
member
of
the
crew.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
well,
your
honor,
let's
put
it
this
way.
if
you
say
fire,
he
could
take
his
boat
and
say
that
to
tie
it
up
or
he
could
refuse
to
give
him
a
boat
the
following
season.
well
i
would
construe
that
to
mean
rather
than
firing
him
that
he
just
didn't
want
to
renew
the
contract
at
the
beginning
of
another
year.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
well
--
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
your
honor,
i
would
hope
he
would
and
i
couldn't
--
i
don't
see
how
that
would
turn
him
into
an
employee.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
well
i'm
afraid
i
don't
follow
that.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
i
don't
think
he
could,
but
if
he
was
just
a
thief
at
heart
and
stole
something
else,
i'd
imagine
he'd
get
rid
of
him.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
it
was
open
for
the
district
court
here
to
hold
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
two
acts,
that
fisherman
could
very
well
have
been
employees
of
the
owners.
but
it's
obvious
from
the
findings
that
the
district
court
had
the
common
law
test
clearly
in
mind.
for
example,
the
court
found
specifically
that
the
tax
payer
had
no
right
to
nor
attempted
to
instruct
the
captain
or
crew
as
to
their
fishing
activity
or
how
to
accomplish
it.
another
specific
finding;
there
was
no
expressed
agreements
specifying
the
extent
of
the
tax
payer's
control
over
the
captain's
activities.
another;
it
was
clear
that
no
actual
control
was
exercised
over
the
details
or
the
manner
and
method
employed
by
the
captains
and
crews.
one
more,
the
tax
payers
had
a
right
to
control
the
results
and
interfered
to
a
degree
only
to
assure
a
proper
result
from
the
undertaking.
and
then
the
tax
payers
had
no
control
over
the
crewmen
nor
did
they
attempt
to
exercise
it
through
the
captains.
now,
the
petitioner
has
ignored
these
findings
both
in
his
brief
and
in
his
oral
argument.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
well,
the
court
of
appeals
did
say
that
if
the
maritime
entered
--
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
yes
and
if
the
maritime
standard
were
to
be
applied,
then
it
said
we
would
have
to
reverse
this
decision.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
yes,
i
guess
--
i
would
say
that
would
be
a
fair
statement
your
honor.
so
in
summary,
the
captains
participated
in
bilateral
decisions
and
negotiations
in
fixing
the
price
and
they
exercised
a
high
degree
of
independence
in
conducting
their
operations
and
exercised
initiative
and
decision
making
authority.
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
--
you're
absolutely
correct
in
that
respect
because
one
of
the
points
i
believe
that
petitioner
raises
and
petitioner
raised
numerous
points
and
we
did
our
best
to
brief
each
one
thoroughly,
but
we
think
two
points
raised
in
the
main
brief
and
one
in
the
reply
brief
suggest
a
discussion.
the
first
is
in
evaluation
of
the
relationship
here
between
the
boat
owner
and
the
fishermen
for
these
tax
purposes,
what
legal
standard
should
be
applied?
the
principles
of
general
maritime
law
as
they
contend,
or
the
principles
of
the
common
law
in
the
statute
as
we
contend?
the
second
point
was
assuming
the
petitioner's
contention
that
this
case
involves
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
would
that
circumstance
call
for
a
different
result
and
not
reached
by
the
concurrent
decisions
below?
now
in
the
reply
brief
if
the
court
please,
there
was
a
new
point
raised
and
it
poses
this
question.
is
proof
of
filing
an
employment
tax
return
and
the
payment
of
the
tax
a
defense
against
a
suit
for
its
refund?
now,
we
didn't
get
a
chance
to
brief
that
for
the
court
because
the
reply
brief
was
served
on
us
i
think
only
thursday
or
friday.
i
want
to
discuss
that
briefly
here
if
i
may.
at
pages
four
through
six
which
is
point
three
of
the
reply
brief,
the
petitioner
says
that
because
the
respondents
filed
employment
tax
returns
and
paid
the
taxes
and
kept
good
records,
the
respondents
thought
or
believed
that
the
captains
and
crewmen
were
their
employees
and
for
that
reason,
our
suit
for
refund
should
be
dismissed.
now,
if
belief
is
to
be
a
criteria
of
employment
status,
it's
material
only
when
one
party
believes
that
he
has
the
right
to
control
and
direct
the
activities
of
another
and
the
other
believes
that
he
must
submit
to
that
control,
but
i
find
it
puzzling
how
filing
a
tax
return
can
come
to
that
same
arrangement.
now,
people
pay
taxes
and
file
returns
for
many
reasons
and
i
don't
think
that
they
ponder
legal
concepts
when
they're
about
to
do
it.
now
suppose
the
respondents
here
had
made
their
own
determinations
and
decided
that
the
fishermen
were
independent
contractors
and
decided
not
to
pay
the
taxes,
what
would've
happened?
well
of
course
a
number
of
things
would
happen,
but
experience
in
the
fishing
industry
showed
this.
that
the
tax
collector
would
file
liens
on
the
boats,
attach
whatever
property
at
hand,
including
bank
accounts
and
literally
tie
up
your
business.
now
this
happened
in
enochs
versus
williams
packing
company
which
came
to
this
court.
it
will
be
remembered
that
william's
was
a
shrimp
boat
fleet
operator.
he
had
made
a
decision
that
these
men
were
independent
contractors
and
had
for
a
long
time.
he
didn't
pay
any
tax
and
he
didn't
file
a
return.
an
assessment
of
about
$50,000.00
was
made.
a
--
his
boats
were
tied
up.
the
--
william's
went
to
the
district
court
and
obtained
an
injunction
against
the
collection.
the
circuit
court
affirmed
with
one
dissent.
it
came
here
on
jurisdictional
issue
of
enjoining
the
collection
of
taxes.
the
injunction
was
dissolved.
it
was
remanded
with
directions
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
thereafter,
williams
paid
a
small
amount
of
that
tax
and
not
because
he
believed
that
these
people
were
employees
and
he
filed
another
suit
in
the
district
court
and
the
government
counterclaimed
for
$50,000.00
for
whatever
the
assessment
was.
william
has
prevailed
and
the
government's
counterclaim
was
dismissed
and
that's
in
william's
packing
versus
u.s,
the
number
is
2631
in
the
southern
district
of
mississippi,
the
judgment
was
filed
february
18,
1964.
now,
the
government
made
the
same
contention
without
success
in
another
employment
tax
case.
this
involved
the
employment
status
of
certain
mechanics
and
their
helpers,
they
call
them
applicators.
the
court's
treatment
i
think
is
worthy
of
consideration
here
since
we
didn't
get
an
opportunity
to
brief
it.
please
permit
me
to
read
just
a
short
paragraph
from
the
case
of
rayhill
versus
united
states,
364
f.2nd
356
and
this
will
complete
my
analysis
at
this
point.
in
that
case
it
said,
“nor
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
can
an
intent
to
create
an
employer-employee
relationship
be
inferred
from
the
fact
without
more
that
plaintiff
withheld
from,
and
paid
the
appropriate
federal
taxes
on
the
earnings
of
the
applicators.
failure
to
have
made
such
withholdings
and
payments
might
have
subjected
it
to
assessments
and
penalties
and
possible
criminal
sanctions.
then,
too,
the
plaintiff
could
not
have
challenged
a
deficiency
in
the
tax
court
or
had
a
reasonable
prospect
of
obtaining
an
injunction
to
restrain
enforcement
of
the
tax,”
citing
enochs
versus
williams
packing.
“one
need
not
resort
to
martyrdom
to
obtain
judicial
determination
of
the
issue
here.
to
suggest
that
plaintiff
should
not
have
paid
the
tax
if
it
believed
that
the
applicators
were
not
common-law
employees
would
be
to
approve
snares
and
traps
for
the
unwary.
in
addition,
the
payment
of
the
tax
was
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
to
the
filing
of
this
suit.
it
would
be
an
unusual
law
which
first
required
the
payment
of
a
tax
as
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
to
the
filing
of
a
suit
for
its
refund
and
then
permit
its
payment
to
be
a
ground
for
a
defense
against
the
claim.
before
going
into
that
maritime
oriented
employee
point,
i'd
like
to
mention
this
that
the
petition
for
the
writ
here
indicated
that
the
decision
below
will
disrupt
even
handed
administration
of
the
social
security
act
and
would
cause
certain
fishermen
to
lose
social
security
benefits
and
we
take
exception
to
that
in
full.
the
petitioner
did
not
pursue
this
point
when
he
had
its
brief
on
the
merits.
we
think
the
contention
raised
important
issues
respecting
the
social
and
remedial
aspects
of
the
social
security
act
and
should
be
--
and
should
not
be
ignored
simply
because
it
was
raised.
now,
the
decision
below
does
not
deprive
the
fishermen
of
their
social
security
benefits.
in
holding
that
these
fishermen
were
not
employees,
it
follows
as
a
consequence
that
they
were
self
employed
or
independent
contractors
which
congress
put
into
one
group.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
your
honor,
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
well,
in
the
posture
of
this
case
your
honor,
we
only
have
the
tax
refund
of
the
employer
--
of
the
respondents.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
we
don't
have
the
situation
of
a
captain
having
paid
the
tax
on
their
earnings.
however,
going
into
that
point,
in
the
case
of
u.s.
v.
joe
graso
and
sons
which
is
in
our
brief,
this
question
came
up
sometime
ago
when
the
government
tried
to
file
a
third
party
complaint
to
make
the
captains
liable
for
the
taxes
if
the
owners
were
not
liable.
it
was
held
that
it
was
being
an
independent
action
the
third
party
complaint
was
dismissed.
it
didn't
get
to
that
point.
also
the
court
in
graso
did
say
that
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
relationship
between
the
captains
and
the
fishermen
would
not
be
that
of
employer-employee.
you'd
have
to
test
it
against
the
statute
first.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
department
of
justice
in
an
anti-trust
case
was
quite
successful
in
prosecuting
members
of
the
fish
industry.
in
local
36,
international
fishermen
and
allied
workers
versus
u.s.
177
f.2nd
320
which
is
cited
graso
and
there
it
was
found
that
the
captains
and
the
crewmen
were
joint
venturers.
in
that
case,
the
government
needed
proof
of
joint
venture
rather
an
employer-employee
for
the
success
of
their
prosecution
and
even
though
social
security
taxes
were
paid
in
that
case
and
the
defendants
tried
everything
to
prove
an
employment
relationship,
the
court
held
it
as
a
joint
venture
between
the
captain
and
the
fishermen.
i'd
like
to
say
that
these
fishermen
are
not
loosing
social
insurance
benefits
because
by
virtue
of
the
1950
amendments
of
the
social
security
act,
benefits
were
extended
to
the
self
employed
for
the
first
time.
prior
to
these
amendments,
it's
true
they
may
have
been
deprived
of
such
benefits.
so
the
distinction
today
between
the
common
law
employee
and
the
self
employed
person
or
the
entrepreneur
with
respect
to
social
insurance
at
least
is
no
longer
meaningful.
it's
now
only
a
tax
matter.
the
question
is
who
pays
the
tax
and
what
is
the
difference?
as
far
as
the
even
--
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
in
both
cases,
the
same
in
both
cases.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
except
the
rate
is
a
little
different.
i
think
that
the
self
employed
would
pay
something
less
than
three-fourths
of
the
total
that
would
be
paid
between
an
employer
and
employee.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
the
ultimate
benefits.
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honor,
there
is
one
benefit
i
think
the
self
employed
man
gets
that
the
common
law
employee
does
not
and
he
can
participate
in
the
i
think
it's
the
1964
self
employment
pension
act
where
lawyers
are
doing
it
and
i'm
sure
that
there
are
some
fish
captains
that
do
it.
now,
this
equality
between
the
two
categories
is
demonstrated
because
the
earnings
credits
of
these
people
which
determine
their
benefits,
they're
entitled
to
the
same
weight
and
dignity.
the
social
security
administration
is
the
same
administration
that
dispenses
benefits
to
both.
the
same
tax
collector
collects
taxes
for
both.
now,
the
petitioner's
main
thrust
here
is
that
the
common
law
test
should
not
be
applied,
but
the
rule
governing
employment
relationships
under
maritime
law
should
be
decisive
in
fixing
the
respondent's
tax
liabilities.
now,
if
liability
for
these
taxes
is
to
be
so
determined,
it
is
a
matter
for
congress'
consideration
rather
than
this
court
because
it
involves
federal
fiscal
policy
and
prerogatives
of
legislative
definition.
i
might
say
that
during
the
pendency
of
this
case,
the
treasury
department
attempted
to
seek
an
amendment
of
this
act
to
call
these
fishermen
statutory
employees
but
congress
took
no
action
on
it.
the
congress'
failure
to
act
if
the
court
please
doesn't
tell
us
anything,
but
it
does
--
but
the
incident
does
tell
us
this
that
the
treasury
department
felt
that
it
was
vulnerable
to
adverse
decisions
by
the
finder
of
fact
who
would
apply
the
common
law
rule,
otherwise,
the
treasury
department
wouldn't
be
concerned
about
it.
now,
the
petitioner
raised
and
said
if
a
seaman
is
entitled
the
maintenance
and
the
cure
from
the
owner,
he
must
be
the
owner's
employee
under
maritime
standards,
now
i'll
accept
that.
but
petitioner
concludes
without
more
that
the
seaman
mechanically
becomes
an
employee
for
federal
employment
tax
purposes
and
hence
a
common
law
employee.
now
the
same
individual
can
be
an
employee
and
an
independent
contractor
at
the
same
time.
this
court
said
in
the
labor
board
versus
harris,
a
brief
quote,
“an
individual
maybe
an
independent
contractor
under
the
common
law
control
test
for
purposes
of
imposing
vicarious
liability
in
tort,
and
maybe
an
employee
for
the
purpose
of
other
litigations
such
as
unemployment
insurance.
”
i
see
my
time
is
about
to
expire
if
the
court
please
but
i
want
to
say
this
that
the
fishermen
in
this
case
whom
the
court
found
did
not
meet
the
common
law
test
of
master
and
servant
are
nevertheless
entitled
to
maintenance
and
cure
by
virtue
of
their
marine
employment.
the
court
said
in
aguilar
versus
standard
oil
company
when
this
particular
question
came
up.
it
says
“whether
by
a
traditional
standards
that
boat
owner
is
or
is
not
responsible
for
the
injury,
yet
under
maritime
law
is
nevertheless
liable
as
an
incident
of
the
marine
employer-employee
relationship.
”
we
suggest
that
the
main
thrust
of
petitioner's
point
there
is
without
a
merit.
i'd
like
you
say
in
concluding
that
this
decision
is
not
contrary
to
public
policy
as
mr.
griswold
has
suggested.
it
will
not
frustrate
the
remedial
aims
of
maintenance
and
cure
or
other
maritime
rights.
there
are
many
independent
contractor
relationships
which
are
workable
under
the
social
security
act
and
the
rulings
of
the
commission
of
internal
revenue
will
demonstrate
that.
one
outstanding
that
comes
to
mind
is
that
he
considers
a
self
employed
person,
one
who
is
able
to
carry
on
his
own
business.
a
poll
taker
for
one
who
is
advertising
agencies
simply
because
this
poll
taker
works
on
a
job-to-job
basis
and
yet
he
is
paid
by
the
company,
directed
by
the
company
nevertheless
is
a
ruling.
the
internal
revenue
service
contained
an
internal
revenue
bulletin
number
1965-30
of
july
26,
1965.
it
says
that
those
who
conduct
surveys
on
certain
types
of
advertising
are
self
employed
persons.
they're
in
a
business
of
their
own
simply
because
they
knock
on
a
door
and
fill
out
a
form
for
some
company.
certainly,
fishermen
who
are
more
skilled
and
who
have
a
way
of
life
are
certainly
more
in
keeping
with
a
trade
or
business
and
some
poll
taker
or
a
real
estate
salesman
for
instance,
they
consider
him
a
self
employed
person.
a
taxicab
driver,
the
internal
revenues
put
out
many
bulletins
to
taxicab
drivers
are
considered
independent
contractors.
although
they
drive
the
cab
of
the
company,
the
company
has
great
expenditures
and
the
real
man,
this
company
has
great
expenditures
in
promoting
and
keeping
an
office
open,
yet
the
government
finds
for
tax
purposes,
he
too
is
a
self
employed
person.
so
in
conclusion,
we
ask
that
the
court
consider
that
the
common
law
test
be
applied
and
then
if
there's
any
other
test
to
be
applied
that
the
department
of
justice
address
itself
to
the
congress.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondents
say
that
the
only
question
of
substance
here
is
whether
the
concurrent
findings
of
fact
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
below
are
amply
supported
by
the
record.
and
whether
those
courts
applied
the
proper
legal
standards
in
reaching
the
conclusion
of
law
or
whether
the
findings
and
conclusions
are
clearly
erroneous.
now,
these
cases
are
suits
for
refund
of
federal
employment
taxes
erroneously
paid
on
the
earnings
of
certain
fishermen
who
used
and
operated
the
respondent's
manhattan
vessels.
now,
the
sole--
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
a
mixed
question
of
law
in
fact
i
believe
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
on
review
that
where
a
statute
would
preclude
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
i
would
say
that
would
be
a
question
of
law
and
reviewable
on
appeal
where
the
statute
would
preclude
the
decision.
however,
where
fact
elements
are
concerned
in
this
mixed
question,
the
reviewing
courts
are
bound
by
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
and
a
reviewing
court
will
set
aside
a
trial
court's
decision
only
when
the
facts
found
fall
short
at
meeting
the
statutory
requirements.
i
believe
that
was
this
court's
ruling
in
trust
of
bingham
--
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be
there,
no
your
honor,
that's
correct.
well,
the
sole
issue
before
the
district
court
was
whether
the
boat
owners,
also
the
respondents
here
reliable
for
the
excise
tax
portion
of
the
employment
taxes
imposed
on
their
earnings
of
the
fishermen
and
that's
the
captains
and
the
crewmen.
now,
the
respondent's
liability
or
non-liability
for
these
taxes
depended
upon
the
definition
of
the
term
employee
and
that
term
is
defined
in
two
sections
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
both
of
which
adopt
the
common
law
control
test.
now,
the
trial
court
held
that
the
tax
per
owners
had
proved
their
claims
for
refund
and
as
a
consequence,
the
fishermen
were
not
their
employees
under
those
statutes,
for
other
purposes
it
may
have
been,
but
under
those
statutes,
they
weren't.
now,
the
trial
court
resolved
all
issues
under
these
statutes.
all
issues
of
facts
in
favor
to
the
boat
owners
and
particularly,
those
issues
as
to
the
absence
of
control
over
the
manner
and
method
in
which
the
work
was
done.
now,
the
circuit
court
refused
to
set
aside
the
trial
court's
findings
and
conclusions
since
they
were
the
result
of
a
choice
between
two
permissible
views
of
the
weight
of
the
evidence
and
held
they
were
not
clearly
erroneous.
now,
the
district
court
made
51
separately
numbered
detailed
findings
and
covering
about
19
pages
of
this
record.
briefly,
i
would
say
the
needle
points
as
far
as
our
presentation
is
concerned
would
be
this.
the
respondents
were
owners
of
manhattan
boats.
they
equipped
and
maintained
them,
repaired
them
for
commercial
fishing
purposes.
they
contracted
with
the
captains
to
gather
the
fish.
now,
an
owner
would
relinquish
complete
control
of
that
boat
to
a
captain.
the
captain
would
then
staff
it
with
his
own
crew,
his
own
organization
which
consisted
of
mast
to
bow
mates
engineers,
pilots,
experienced
net
man,
and
a
cook
or
maybe
two.
the
captain
will
then
provision
the
boat
at
his
own
expense
and
anyway
that
he
saw
fit
and
all
of
these
was
without
any
interference
by
the
owners.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
groceries,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
no,
he
paid
those
out
of
his
own
pocket.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
oh,
yes.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
that's
right.
many
times
that's
happened.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
yes
your
honor
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
groceries
or
that
would
be
all.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
no,
those
were
all
paid
by
the
owners.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
your
honor,
just
to
bring
that
up,
the
crew
members
are
paid
out
of
the
pocket
of
the
captain.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
that's
correct.
i
want
to
correct
one
--
correct
--
just
want
to
give
my
view
of
mr.
griswold's
statement
that
this
was
a
lay
system.
this
wasn't
a
lay
system
at
all.
this
was
a
pure
sale.
in
other
words,
when
a
fish
boat
came
in
and
the
captain
came
in
with
a
large
catch,
he
sold
that
--
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
to
the
owner.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
the
owner
and
the
plant
had
another
arrangement
or
some
kind.
the
plant
was
not
a
party
to
this
suit
and
it's
important
that
the
plant
was
not
a
party
to
this
suit
because
in
one
of
these
findings
which
mr.
griswold
mentioned,
he
said
that
the
respondents
made
a
payroll
record,
that
wasn't
so.
the
plant
made
up
his
payroll
records.
the
plant
was
in
the
middle
acting
as
agent
you
might
say
for
the
captain
and
also
for
the
owners
because
it
was
to
the
plant's
interest
to
get
as
many
of
these
people
to
bring
fish
in
as
possible.
well
anyway,
the
captain
agreed
without
a
guarantee
of
any
kind
to
make
fishing
trips
for
a
season
and
return
the
catches
to
the
plants
that
were
owned
by
the
parties
who
were
not
parties
to
this
suit.
now,
the
price
that
the
owner
paid
to
the
captain
was
agreed
upon
between
the
owner
and
the
captain
and
this
was
if
the
court
please,
a
bilateral
decision
after
negotiations.
this
wasn't
something
i
said
i'm
going
to
give
you
this
much
and
that's
all
you
get,
this
was
a
give
and
take
proposition.
the
prices
differed
with
the
seasons
and
even
differed
among
owners
and
captains.
but
once
a
price
was
fixed
for
a
season,
it
remained
that
price
during
that
season.
now,
there
was
nothing
in
the
arrangements
which
indicated
that
a
captain
would
be
offered
a
boat
beyond
a
single
season
or
that
he
would
promise
a
fisher
boat
for
anybody
else
beyond
the
single
season.
there
is
no
connotative
relationship
here
in
any
meaningful
sense.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
yes,
i
would
say
that
it
was
contemplated
here
that
they
would
take
it
for
the
season
which
was
about
four
to
five
months
or
six
months
depending
where
they
were.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
yes,
but
as
a
practical
matter
if
the
court
please,
if
the
boat
is
equipped
and
ready
to
go
and
there
are
plenty
of
fish
out
there
and
the
captain
has
his
organization,
i
cannot
imagine
that
an
owner
would
just
willy
nilly
fire
a
captain
and
leave
a
profitable
venture
sitting
at
the
dock.
if
any
one
is
going
to
quit,
it
would
be
the
captain.
of
course
if
the
fish
disappeared
or
captain
fell
ill,
of
course
that
might
end
the
voyage.
but
the
owner,
he
hoped
and
prayed
the
captain
would
stay
and
he
had
a
good
crew
and
that
he
wouldn't
lose
the
crew.
now,
these
captains
were
free
to
perform
these
services
for
any
boat
owner
anywhere
at
anytime.
there
was
no
suggestion
if
the
owners
had
a
preferred
call
and
the
time
or
efforts
of
these
captains.
now,
the
crew
was
hired
and
paid
by
the
captains.
now,
the
compensation
paid
to
the
crew
came
solely
out
of
the
pocket
of
the
captain
and
if
there
was
a
catch,
mr.
justice
white,
the
proceeds
of
that
sale
became
the
captain's
money.
there's
no
lay
system
here.
it
was
then
divided
among
the
crew
in
accordance
with
the
prior
arrangements
with
the
captain
and
the
crew.
if
there
was
no
catch
as
you
say
then
no
one
is
paid.
now
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
record
of
a
union
contract
involved
at
all
or
bargaining
agents
between
any
of
the
parties.
each
captain
dealt
with
each
owner
on
an
individual
basis
and
each
crewman
dealt
with
each
captain
on
an
individual
basis.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
your
honor,
the
amount
of
money
was
issued
in
a
pay
scale
by
the
owners.
now,
the
district
court
said
nothing
more
than
that,
but
i
attribute
that
your
honor
to
the
owner's
control
over
the
result
of
this
enterprise
because
if
somebody
didn't
do
something
to
stabilize
what
these
men
would
get
in
a
plant
area,
there'd
be
chaos.
they
would
be
raiding
each
others'
crews'
right
in
the
--
right
down
at
the
dock.
so
--
and
that
has
happened
many
times.
so
to
avoid
that,
the
captains
actually
and
the
owners
would
get
together
and
it
may
violate
anti
trust
laws
but
they
would
fix
that
price
that
these
crews
would
get.
and
then
once
the
crews
were
fixed,
i
think
there's
a
finding
which
states
that
the
captain
had
discretion
to
vary
that
once
he
was
out,
but
that
was
the
purpose
of
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
the
owners--
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
pardon?
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
the
captain
hires
the
crew
entirely.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
no
your
honor,
absolutely
not.
that
was
specifically
found.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
well,
the
court
so
found
and
it
has
never
happened.
i
mean,
the
owner
now
cannot
fire
any
member
of
the
crew.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
well,
your
honor,
let's
put
it
this
way.
if
you
say
fire,
he
could
take
his
boat
and
say
that
to
tie
it
up
or
he
could
refuse
to
give
him
a
boat
the
following
season.
well
i
would
construe
that
to
mean
rather
than
firing
him
that
he
just
didn't
want
to
renew
the
contract
at
the
beginning
of
another
year.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
well
--
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
your
honor,
i
would
hope
he
would
and
i
couldn't
--
i
don't
see
how
that
would
turn
him
into
an
employee.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
well
i'm
afraid
i
don't
follow
that.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
i
don't
think
he
could,
but
if
he
was
just
a
thief
at
heart
and
stole
something
else,
i'd
imagine
he'd
get
rid
of
him.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
it
was
open
for
the
district
court
here
to
hold
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
two
acts,
that
fisherman
could
very
well
have
been
employees
of
the
owners.
but
it's
obvious
from
the
findings
that
the
district
court
had
the
common
law
test
clearly
in
mind.
for
example,
the
court
found
specifically
that
the
tax
payer
had
no
right
to
nor
attempted
to
instruct
the
captain
or
crew
as
to
their
fishing
activity
or
how
to
accomplish
it.
another
specific
finding;
there
was
no
expressed
agreements
specifying
the
extent
of
the
tax
payer's
control
over
the
captain's
activities.
another;
it
was
clear
that
no
actual
control
was
exercised
over
the
details
or
the
manner
and
method
employed
by
the
captains
and
crews.
one
more,
the
tax
payers
had
a
right
to
control
the
results
and
interfered
to
a
degree
only
to
assure
a
proper
result
from
the
undertaking.
and
then
the
tax
payers
had
no
control
over
the
crewmen
nor
did
they
attempt
to
exercise
it
through
the
captains.
now,
the
petitioner
has
ignored
these
findings
both
in
his
brief
and
in
his
oral
argument.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
well,
the
court
of
appeals
did
say
that
if
the
maritime
entered
--
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
yes
and
if
the
maritime
standard
were
to
be
applied,
then
it
said
we
would
have
to
reverse
this
decision.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
yes,
i
guess
--
i
would
say
that
would
be
a
fair
statement
your
honor.
so
in
summary,
the
captains
participated
in
bilateral
decisions
and
negotiations
in
fixing
the
price
and
they
exercised
a
high
degree
of
independence
in
conducting
their
operations
and
exercised
initiative
and
decision
making
authority.
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
--
you're
absolutely
correct
in
that
respect
because
one
of
the
points
i
believe
that
petitioner
raises
and
petitioner
raised
numerous
points
and
we
did
our
best
to
brief
each
one
thoroughly,
but
we
think
two
points
raised
in
the
main
brief
and
one
in
the
reply
brief
suggest
a
discussion.
the
first
is
in
evaluation
of
the
relationship
here
between
the
boat
owner
and
the
fishermen
for
these
tax
purposes,
what
legal
standard
should
be
applied?
the
principles
of
general
maritime
law
as
they
contend,
or
the
principles
of
the
common
law
in
the
statute
as
we
contend?
the
second
point
was
assuming
the
petitioner's
contention
that
this
case
involves
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
would
that
circumstance
call
for
a
different
result
and
not
reached
by
the
concurrent
decisions
below?
now
in
the
reply
brief
if
the
court
please,
there
was
a
new
point
raised
and
it
poses
this
question.
is
proof
of
filing
an
employment
tax
return
and
the
payment
of
the
tax
a
defense
against
a
suit
for
its
refund?
now,
we
didn't
get
a
chance
to
brief
that
for
the
court
because
the
reply
brief
was
served
on
us
i
think
only
thursday
or
friday.
i
want
to
discuss
that
briefly
here
if
i
may.
at
pages
four
through
six
which
is
point
three
of
the
reply
brief,
the
petitioner
says
that
because
the
respondents
filed
employment
tax
returns
and
paid
the
taxes
and
kept
good
records,
the
respondents
thought
or
believed
that
the
captains
and
crewmen
were
their
employees
and
for
that
reason,
our
suit
for
refund
should
be
dismissed.
now,
if
belief
is
to
be
a
criteria
of
employment
status,
it's
material
only
when
one
party
believes
that
he
has
the
right
to
control
and
direct
the
activities
of
another
and
the
other
believes
that
he
must
submit
to
that
control,
but
i
find
it
puzzling
how
filing
a
tax
return
can
come
to
that
same
arrangement.
now,
people
pay
taxes
and
file
returns
for
many
reasons
and
i
don't
think
that
they
ponder
legal
concepts
when
they're
about
to
do
it.
now
suppose
the
respondents
here
had
made
their
own
determinations
and
decided
that
the
fishermen
were
independent
contractors
and
decided
not
to
pay
the
taxes,
what
would've
happened?
well
of
course
a
number
of
things
would
happen,
but
experience
in
the
fishing
industry
showed
this.
that
the
tax
collector
would
file
liens
on
the
boats,
attach
whatever
property
at
hand,
including
bank
accounts
and
literally
tie
up
your
business.
now
this
happened
in
enochs
versus
williams
packing
company
which
came
to
this
court.
it
will
be
remembered
that
william's
was
a
shrimp
boat
fleet
operator.
he
had
made
a
decision
that
these
men
were
independent
contractors
and
had
for
a
long
time.
he
didn't
pay
any
tax
and
he
didn't
file
a
return.
an
assessment
of
about
$50,000.00
was
made.
a
--
his
boats
were
tied
up.
the
--
william's
went
to
the
district
court
and
obtained
an
injunction
against
the
collection.
the
circuit
court
affirmed
with
one
dissent.
it
came
here
on
jurisdictional
issue
of
enjoining
the
collection
of
taxes.
the
injunction
was
dissolved.
it
was
remanded
with
directions
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
thereafter,
williams
paid
a
small
amount
of
that
tax
and
not
because
he
believed
that
these
people
were
employees
and
he
filed
another
suit
in
the
district
court
and
the
government
counterclaimed
for
$50,000.00
for
whatever
the
assessment
was.
william
has
prevailed
and
the
government's
counterclaim
was
dismissed
and
that's
in
william's
packing
versus
u.s,
the
number
is
2631
in
the
southern
district
of
mississippi,
the
judgment
was
filed
february
18,
1964.
now,
the
government
made
the
same
contention
without
success
in
another
employment
tax
case.
this
involved
the
employment
status
of
certain
mechanics
and
their
helpers,
they
call
them
applicators.
the
court's
treatment
i
think
is
worthy
of
consideration
here
since
we
didn't
get
an
opportunity
to
brief
it.
please
permit
me
to
read
just
a
short
paragraph
from
the
case
of
rayhill
versus
united
states,
364
f.2nd
356
and
this
will
complete
my
analysis
at
this
point.
in
that
case
it
said,
“nor
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
can
an
intent
to
create
an
employer-employee
relationship
be
inferred
from
the
fact
without
more
that
plaintiff
withheld
from,
and
paid
the
appropriate
federal
taxes
on
the
earnings
of
the
applicators.
failure
to
have
made
such
withholdings
and
payments
might
have
subjected
it
to
assessments
and
penalties
and
possible
criminal
sanctions.
then,
too,
the
plaintiff
could
not
have
challenged
a
deficiency
in
the
tax
court
or
had
a
reasonable
prospect
of
obtaining
an
injunction
to
restrain
enforcement
of
the
tax,”
citing
enochs
versus
williams
packing.
“one
need
not
resort
to
martyrdom
to
obtain
judicial
determination
of
the
issue
here.
to
suggest
that
plaintiff
should
not
have
paid
the
tax
if
it
believed
that
the
applicators
were
not
common-law
employees
would
be
to
approve
snares
and
traps
for
the
unwary.
in
addition,
the
payment
of
the
tax
was
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
to
the
filing
of
this
suit.
it
would
be
an
unusual
law
which
first
required
the
payment
of
a
tax
as
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
to
the
filing
of
a
suit
for
its
refund
and
then
permit
its
payment
to
be
a
ground
for
a
defense
against
the
claim.
before
going
into
that
maritime
oriented
employee
point,
i'd
like
to
mention
this
that
the
petition
for
the
writ
here
indicated
that
the
decision
below
will
disrupt
even
handed
administration
of
the
social
security
act
and
would
cause
certain
fishermen
to
lose
social
security
benefits
and
we
take
exception
to
that
in
full.
the
petitioner
did
not
pursue
this
point
when
he
had
its
brief
on
the
merits.
we
think
the
contention
raised
important
issues
respecting
the
social
and
remedial
aspects
of
the
social
security
act
and
should
be
--
and
should
not
be
ignored
simply
because
it
was
raised.
now,
the
decision
below
does
not
deprive
the
fishermen
of
their
social
security
benefits.
in
holding
that
these
fishermen
were
not
employees,
it
follows
as
a
consequence
that
they
were
self
employed
or
independent
contractors
which
congress
put
into
one
group.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
your
honor,
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
well,
in
the
posture
of
this
case
your
honor,
we
only
have
the
tax
refund
of
the
employer
--
of
the
respondents.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
we
don't
have
the
situation
of
a
captain
having
paid
the
tax
on
their
earnings.
however,
going
into
that
point,
in
the
case
of
u.s.
v.
joe
graso
and
sons
which
is
in
our
brief,
this
question
came
up
sometime
ago
when
the
government
tried
to
file
a
third
party
complaint
to
make
the
captains
liable
for
the
taxes
if
the
owners
were
not
liable.
it
was
held
that
it
was
being
an
independent
action
the
third
party
complaint
was
dismissed.
it
didn't
get
to
that
point.
also
the
court
in
graso
did
say
that
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
relationship
between
the
captains
and
the
fishermen
would
not
be
that
of
employer-employee.
you'd
have
to
test
it
against
the
statute
first.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
department
of
justice
in
an
anti-trust
case
was
quite
successful
in
prosecuting
members
of
the
fish
industry.
in
local
36,
international
fishermen
and
allied
workers
versus
u.s.
177
f.2nd
320
which
is
cited
graso
and
there
it
was
found
that
the
captains
and
the
crewmen
were
joint
venturers.
in
that
case,
the
government
needed
proof
of
joint
venture
rather
an
employer-employee
for
the
success
of
their
prosecution
and
even
though
social
security
taxes
were
paid
in
that
case
and
the
defendants
tried
everything
to
prove
an
employment
relationship,
the
court
held
it
as
a
joint
venture
between
the
captain
and
the
fishermen.
i'd
like
to
say
that
these
fishermen
are
not
loosing
social
insurance
benefits
because
by
virtue
of
the
1950
amendments
of
the
social
security
act,
benefits
were
extended
to
the
self
employed
for
the
first
time.
prior
to
these
amendments,
it's
true
they
may
have
been
deprived
of
such
benefits.
so
the
distinction
today
between
the
common
law
employee
and
the
self
employed
person
or
the
entrepreneur
with
respect
to
social
insurance
at
least
is
no
longer
meaningful.
it's
now
only
a
tax
matter.
the
question
is
who
pays
the
tax
and
what
is
the
difference?
as
far
as
the
even
--
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
in
both
cases,
the
same
in
both
cases.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
except
the
rate
is
a
little
different.
i
think
that
the
self
employed
would
pay
something
less
than
three-fourths
of
the
total
that
would
be
paid
between
an
employer
and
employee.
mr.
joseph
j.
lyman
the
ultimate
benefits.
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honor,
there
is
one
benefit
i
think
the
self
employed
man
gets
that
the
common
law
employee
does
not
and
he
can
participate
in
the
i
think
it's
the
1964
self
employment
pension
act
where
lawyers
are
doing
it
and
i'm
sure
that
there
are
some
fish
captains
that
do
it.
now,
this
equality
between
the
two
categories
is
demonstrated
because
the
earnings
credits
of
these
people
which
determine
their
benefits,
they're
entitled
to
the
same
weight
and
dignity.
the
social
security
administration
is
the
same
administration
that
dispenses
benefits
to
both.
the
same
tax
collector
collects
taxes
for
both.
now,
the
petitioner's
main
thrust
here
is
that
the
common
law
test
should
not
be
applied,
but
the
rule
governing
employment
relationships
under
maritime
law
should
be
decisive
in
fixing
the
respondent's
tax
liabilities.
now,
if
liability
for
these
taxes
is
to
be
so
determined,
it
is
a
matter
for
congress'
consideration
rather
than
this
court
because
it
involves
federal
fiscal
policy
and
prerogatives
of
legislative
definition.
i
might
say
that
during
the
pendency
of
this
case,
the
treasury
department
attempted
to
seek
an
amendment
of
this
act
to
call
these
fishermen
statutory
employees
but
congress
took
no
action
on
it.
the
congress'
failure
to
act
if
the
court
please
doesn't
tell
us
anything,
but
it
does
--
but
the
incident
does
tell
us
this
that
the
treasury
department
felt
that
it
was
vulnerable
to
adverse
decisions
by
the
finder
of
fact
who
would
apply
the
common
law
rule,
otherwise,
the
treasury
department
wouldn't
be
concerned
about
it.
now,
the
petitioner
raised
and
said
if
a
seaman
is
entitled
the
maintenance
and
the
cure
from
the
owner,
he
must
be
the
owner's
employee
under
maritime
standards,
now
i'll
accept
that.
but
petitioner
concludes
without
more
that
the
seaman
mechanically
becomes
an
employee
for
federal
employment
tax
purposes
and
hence
a
common
law
employee.
now
the
same
individual
can
be
an
employee
and
an
independent
contractor
at
the
same
time.
this
court
said
in
the
labor
board
versus
harris,
a
brief
quote,
“an
individual
maybe
an
independent
contractor
under
the
common
law
control
test
for
purposes
of
imposing
vicarious
liability
in
tort,
and
maybe
an
employee
for
the
purpose
of
other
litigations
such
as
unemployment
insurance.
”
i
see
my
time
is
about
to
expire
if
the
court
please
but
i
want
to
say
this
that
the
fishermen
in
this
case
whom
the
court
found
did
not
meet
the
common
law
test
of
master
and
servant
are
nevertheless
entitled
to
maintenance
and
cure
by
virtue
of
their
marine
employment.
the
court
said
in
aguilar
versus
standard
oil
company
when
this
particular
question
came
up.
it
says
“whether
by
a
traditional
standards
that
boat
owner
is
or
is
not
responsible
for
the
injury,
yet
under
maritime
law
is
nevertheless
liable
as
an
incident
of
the
marine
employer-employee
relationship.
”
we
suggest
that
the
main
thrust
of
petitioner's
point
there
is
without
a
merit.
i'd
like
you
say
in
concluding
that
this
decision
is
not
contrary
to
public
policy
as
mr.
griswold
has
suggested.
it
will
not
frustrate
the
remedial
aims
of
maintenance
and
cure
or
other
maritime
rights.
there
are
many
independent
contractor
relationships
which
are
workable
under
the
social
security
act
and
the
rulings
of
the
commission
of
internal
revenue
will
demonstrate
that.
one
outstanding
that
comes
to
mind
is
that
he
considers
a
self
employed
person,
one
who
is
able
to
carry
on
his
own
business.
a
poll
taker
for
one
who
is
advertising
agencies
simply
because
this
poll
taker
works
on
a
job-to-job
basis
and
yet
he
is
paid
by
the
company,
directed
by
the
company
nevertheless
is
a
ruling.
the
internal
revenue
service
contained
an
internal
revenue
bulletin
number
1965-30
of
july
26,
1965.
it
says
that
those
who
conduct
surveys
on
certain
types
of
advertising
are
self
employed
persons.
they're
in
a
business
of
their
own
simply
because
they
knock
on
a
door
and
fill
out
a
form
for
some
company.
certainly,
fishermen
who
are
more
skilled
and
who
have
a
way
of
life
are
certainly
more
in
keeping
with
a
trade
or
business
and
some
poll
taker
or
a
real
estate
salesman
for
instance,
they
consider
him
a
self
employed
person.
a
taxicab
driver,
the
internal
revenues
put
out
many
bulletins
to
taxicab
drivers
are
considered
independent
contractors.
although
they
drive
the
cab
of
the
company,
the
company
has
great
expenditures
and
the
real
man,
this
company
has
great
expenditures
in
promoting
and
keeping
an
office
open,
yet
the
government
finds
for
tax
purposes,
he
too
is
a
self
employed
person.
so
in
conclusion,
we
ask
that
the
court
consider
that
the
common
law
test
be
applied
and
then
if
there's
any
other
test
to
be
applied
that
the
department
of
justice
address
itself
to
the
congress.
thank
you.
