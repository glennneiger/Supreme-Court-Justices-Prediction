does
this

it's
a

how
soon
after

or
how
long
before
the

to

it
that
way,
did
the

discovered
that
he
had
not
been
coming
to
his
home
to
sleep
and
was
not
around?

presumably
sometime
after

before

after
the

and
then,
does
the

indicate
that
after
that,
the

made
an
inquiry
of
his
mother
of
other
people
in
the
house,
in
the

did

ten
days
thereafter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
according
to
whom?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
should
think,
mr.
roberts,
that
when
the

came,
the
police
detectives
went
through
the
apartment
and
compared
to
that
his
absence
with
the
