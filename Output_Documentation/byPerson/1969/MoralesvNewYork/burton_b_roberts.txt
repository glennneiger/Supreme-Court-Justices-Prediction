assuming
there
was
no
surrender
here,
assuming
there
was
no
surrender,
in
this
case,
and
if
there
was
a
surrender,
certainly
the
fourth

would
not
come
into

the
taking
of

the

the

the
arrest,
a
melvin
morales
is
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
was
reasonable
and
appropriate
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
fourth
amendment
as
oppose
to
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
applies
a
flexible
and

standard,
it
is
not
absolute

the
fifth
and
the
sixth.
guidelines
have
been
provided
by
terry
against
ohio,
and
i
submit
that
the
people
have
the
right
to
detain
someone
where
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
belief
that
that
individual
has
information
concerning
a
crime
which
has
been
committed.
justice
frankfurter
stated,
it
much
more
adequately
denied.
in
columbia,
in
which
he
said
there
are
things
which
cannot
speak
and
that
it's
necessary
to
detain
and
to
interrogate
witnesses
who
possibly
maybe
suspects
in
order
to
ascertain
who
has
committee
a
particular
crime.
this
case
like
all
cases
appearing
before
this
court,
there
has
to
be
a
balancing
between
society
and
the
individual.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
whose
counsel
has
characterized
as
a
lamb
was
found
by
jury
of
his
peers
to
have
delivered
31

to
a
56-year-old
woman
in
bronx

the

arriving
upon,
the
same
questioned
individuals
and
before
this
investigation
was
over,
they
literally
questioned
over
a
hundred
individuals.
one
information
that
they
received
that
first
night,
they
knew
that
the
individual
or
possibly
the
individual
committed
this
crime
lived
in
that
building
because
one
of
the
tenants
after
the
elevator
arrived
upon
his
floor
heard
footsteps
below
this
particular
floor
and
heard
a
door.
they
questioned
individuals
in
the
building.
they
questioned
mrs.
morales.
they
questioned
her
son
snooky
and
the
evidence
indicates
in
the
record
is
all
we
have
to
go
on
is
that
two
individuals
were
interrogated
by
the
police
at
the
station
house.
snooky,
snooky
morales
and
a
man
by
the
name
of
shortie,
they
had
no
probable
cause
to
arrest
in
a
technical
sense
of
the
term
either
snooky
or
shortie.
but
i
respectfully
submit,
conducting
this
investigation
based
on
the
information
which
they
had.
they
had
a
reasonable
basis
to
detain
and
take
him
to
the
station
house,
these
two
individuals
had
questioned
him
and
checked
out
their
alibi.
ascertain
whether
or
not
these
individuals
could
clear
themselves
in
order
to
solve
this
crime
involving
mrs.
adi
brown.
they
could
never
revive
mrs.
adi
brown
but
it
was
incumbent
upon
these
police
officers,
characterized
as
petty
public
officials
to
work
from
day
break
to
back
break.
in
order
to
solve
this
crime,
so
there
would
not
be
more
adi
browns,
figuratively
speaking,
in
bronx
county
in
the
city
of
new
york.
they
had
to
work,
and
they
had
to
investigate,
and
they
had
to
interrogate,
and
i
respectfully
submit,
they
went
into
the
street
and
they
knew
these
police
officers.
they
knew
melvin
morales.
they
knew
melvin
morales
to
be
a
hustler
and
a
petty
thief
who
had
numerous
convictions
as
a
narcotic
addict.
as
a
policy,
they
knew
this
individual
and
they
knew
his
haunts,
and
they
looked
in
his
haunts.
and
this
individual
was
not
seen
in
this
familiar
haunts.
during
the
course
of
this
investigation
prior
to
the
time
that
melvin
morales
was
taken
to
the
station
house,
they
went
and
interviewed
the
mother.
detective
ferguson
spoke
to
the
mother.
detective
ferguson
was
told
by
the
mother
that
her
son
was
not
around,
that
she
had
not
seen
her
son
for
sometime.
subsequently,
several
days
later,
to
detective
carol
and
detective
downe,
when
she
discovered
they
was
searching
for
her
son
and
looking
for
her
son.
she
gave
an
alibi
for
her
son.
she
said,
“he
was
here.
he
was
here
in
the
apartment.
a
detective
had
gone
through
the
premises.
a
detective
who
knew
melvin
morales,
he
had
not
seen
melvin
morales
in
the
apartment.
the
little
boy
and
his
age
doesn't
appear
on
the
record
or
in
the
record,
was
a
little
boy
who
had
a
kombi,
a
van,
and
this
little
boy
was
walking
his
friend
home
at
approximately
3:20
in
the
morning.
and
everett
roberts
according
to
the
testimony
in
this
record
and
i'm
not
going
to
comment
on
what
the
assistant
district
attorney
stated
concerning
his
testimony
at
this
time.
but
that
little
boy
described
to
the
police
prior
to
the
time
that
melvin
morales
was
detained
or
surrendered,
described
to
the
police
and
individual
a
receding
hairline,
a
puerto
rican,
thin.
and
indeed
the
description
matched
in
the
minds
of
the
detectives
who
are
working
on
this
case,
melvin
morales,
and
intensified
their
search
for
melvin
morales.
and
this
boy
in
court
identified
melvin
morales
as
the
individual
he
saw
at
the
time
of
a
homicide
and
this
little
boy
stated
that
he
saw
this
individual
on
the
day,
on
the
wednesday,
following
the
saturday
night
or
sunday
morning
that
he
saw
the
individual
at
the
bench
infront
of
this
building.
now,
the
court's
notion,
a
probable
cause
is
less
than
the
conservative
attitude
of
both
prosecutor
and
police
officials
with
regard
to
probable
cause,
as
evidence
by
the
peters
case.
and
i
state
to
this
court,
that
if
there
was
probable
cause
or
this
court
was
able
to
find
a
probable
cause
from
the
peters
case
or
in
the
peters
case.
certainly,
the
court
may
very
well
find
from
the
record
we
have
here,
which
we
were
not
able
to
develop
because
the
question
of
unreasonable
detention
was
never
raised
in
the
trial
court.
it's
not
raised
in
the
appellate
division
or
at
the
immediate
appellate
court
but
was
first
raised,
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
court
of
appeals.
certainly
if
it
was
raised,
i
respectfully
submit,
we'll
have
an
opportunity
to
develop
evidence
and
produce
evidence
which
show
how
all
of
these
information
into
hold
and
whether
or
not
indeed,
we
had
additional
information
which
would
enable
us
to
have
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest.
but
i
state
that
on
the
record
itself,
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
which
i
contend
is
all
at
the
fourth
amendment
requires,
a
reasonable
basis
to
detain
this
individual
in
order
to
interrogate
him
and
not
because
there
was
reasonable
belief
that
he
had
information
concerning
the
commission
of
this
crime.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
mr.
justice
harlan,
they
did
and
they
testified,
i
might
add
and
if
i
may
just
go
off
the
subject
that
i
have
now
and
go
back
to
voluntary
surrender
for
a
moment,
they
testified
that
they
saw
the
mother
and
stated
to
the
mother
that
they
were
looking.
they
were
looking
for
melvin
morales,
her
son
melvin
morales,
and
she
says,
“well,
he's
been
around.
he's
not
hiding.
i'll
tell
my
son
that
you're
looking
for
him
detective
carol.”
and
indeed,
she
called
up
her
son
and
this
is
the
testimony
in
the
trial,
testimony
of
mrs.
morales.
substantiated
in
part
by
melvin
morales
himself
when
he
testified
and
she
said,
“melvin,
detective
carol
wants
to
see
you.”
and
he
said,
“well,
i'll
see
him.”
she
says,
“well,
come
up
to
the
beauty
parlor.”
and
the
same
day
that
he
arrived
at
the
beauty
parlor,
she
spoke
to
that
son
and
told
him
where
she
would
be
and
she
then
told
detective
downe
and
detective
carol
that
her
son
would
be
at
the
beauty
parlor,
later
that
evening.
and
at
eight
o'clock,
the
son
arrived.
now,
he
knew
that
detective
carol
was
looking
for
him.
the
mother
stated,
“come
to
the
beauty
parlor.”
he
did
arrive
at
the
beauty
parlor.
detective
downe
and
detective
carol
were
there.
he
voluntarily
went
with
detective
downe
and
detective
carol
to
the
station
house.
this
certainly
is
different
from
the
davis
case
and
that
this
30-year-old
man
as
contrast
to
a
40-year-old
boy.
this
30-year-old
man
voluntarily
went
with
the
police
officers
to
the
station
house,
no
handcuffs,
no
chains,
no
gun,
with
detectives
whom
he
knew
and
whom
he
had
seen
certainly
for
the
last
13
years
of
his
life,
taken
to
the
station
house.
and
there
in
the
station
house,
interposing
his
own
free
will
within
10
to
50
minutes
after
detective
carol
was
advised
of
his
rights
prior
to
miranda,
told
that
he
didn't
have
to
say
anything,
that
anything
he
said
could
be
used
against
him
and
that
the
detective
would
testify
in
court
concerning
what
he
said.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
he
was
arrested
on
october
13th,
19
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
at
the
beauty
shop,
outside
the
beauty
shop,
sir.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
sir,
i
used
the
term
arrest,
the
constitutional
term
arrest,
when
the
person's
right
to
freedom
and
movement
is
interfered
with
i
considered
arrest.
i
consider
it
arrest
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
from
that
moment
on,
he
was
not
voluntarily
free
to
go,
sir.
according
to
the
testimony
of
detective
duff
and
detective
carol
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
sir?
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
the
basis
that
we
had
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
from
the
record
sir.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
from
the
record,
the
basis
that
we
have
to
arrest
him
is
circumstantial
evidence
indicating
that
the
person
who
committed
this
crime
was
a
tenant
in
that
building.
that
this
individual,
melvin
morales,
was
seen
outside
the
premises
of
the
building
contemporaneous
with
the
time
just
before
or
just
after
mrs.
adi
brown
was
killed
that
this
individual
was
a
narcotic
addict.
had
been
a
narcotic
addict
for
many
years,
that
this
individual
was
a
petty
thief,
that
this
individual
was
missing
from
haunts,
that
his
mother
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
i
just
stated
so
what's
in
the
record.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
they
know
it
sir.
they
were
questioned.
they
were
questioned
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
they
did
not
know
that
the
person
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
who
had
committed
the
crime
had
a
long
criminal
record
sir.
but
based
on
their
expertise,
the
expertise
of
a
police
officer
in
the
42nd
squad,
a
person
with
narcotic
background,
a
person
with
a
record
for
petty
thefts,
a
person
who
needed
to
make
a
score
in
order
to
support
his
habit
would
be
more
likely
to
commit
a
crime
such
as
this
in
an
elevator
at
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
than
the
president
of
the
chamber
of
commerce.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
there
are
many
people
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
i
can't
give
you,
i
can
--
in
my
opinion
sir,
there
are
about
60,000
narcotic
addicts
in
the
city
new
york
but
we
have
our
fair
share
in
bronx
county.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
and
a
fair
share
and
save
more
than
50%
of
them
to
make
crime.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
the
evidence
at
that
time
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
that
this
is
morales
is
the
facts
sir,
that
he
was
not
seen
in
his
usual
haunts
for
the
period
of
nine
days.
subsequent
to
this
crime,
that
the
mother
stated
at
first
that
he
was
not
in
the
apartment.
stated
subsequently
that
he
was
in
the
apartment,
that
a
boy
saw
him
sitting
on
a
bench
at
the
time
that
the
crime
had
been
committed
and
i
state
further,
sir,
that
when
i
use
the
term
arrest.
i
equate
it
with
seizure,
i
equate
it
with
detention
and
i
state
that
the
people
or
the
state
has
the
right
to
seize
someone
when
they
have
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
that
that
person
has
information
with
respect
to
a
crime.
and
in
equating
that
with
his
fourth
amendment
rights,
we
take
into
consideration
the
entire
totality
of
circumstances.
the
nature
of
the
crime
that
was
committed,
the
state
of
the
investigation,
the
individual
himself
who
has
been
seized
whether
or
not
the
atmosphere
of
the
station
house
would
be
so
coercive
to
such
an
individual
who
was
ringed
wise,
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
cope
or
would
be
so
coward,
that
his
statement
that
he
would
make
after
being
advised
of
his
rights
would
not
be
voluntary.
the
--
how
long
he
had
been
detained
and
certainly,
i
believe
that
when
one
is
seized,
on
the
basis
that
he
may
reasonably
have
information
with
regard
to
a
crime
that
that
detention
can
only
be
for
a
short
period
of
time,
rather
for
a
lengthy
period
of
time.
the
extent
of
time
that
this
man
was
seized
as
far
as
his
statement
concerning
his
complexity
in
this
crime
was
concerned,
was
of
10
to
15
minutes
sir.
and
based
on
most
facts
sir,
i
believe
that
under
the
fourth
amendment,
recognizing
that
the
statements
applied
by
the
fourth
amendment
are
flexible
and
variable,
that
the
totality
of
this
situation
warrants
the
action
taken
by
the
statement.
pardon
me,
sir,
mr.
justice.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
he
was
booked,
the
next
morning.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
he
did
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
he
was
not
booked
at
that
particular
time
because
at
that
time,
in
the
city
of
new
york,
there
was
no
24-hour
arraignment
and
he
could
not
be
arraigned
until
the
following
morning.
he
was
questioned
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
they
are
different.
he
was
not
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
he
could
have
been
booked
that
night,
he
was--
i
just
don't
know.
i
just
don't
know
that
of
it.
i
do
know
that
prior
to
the
time
that
he
would
be
booked,
it
is
a
procedure
which
we
have
established
that
an
assistant
da,
who
is
on
felony
duty,
reports
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
in
order
to
interrogate
the
individual,
advise
him
of
his
rights
even
prior
to
miranda
ascertain
whether
the
police
department
has
also
advised
this
individual
of
his
rights
in
order
to
ascertain
the
voluntariness
of
the
statement
which
this
individual
is
given.
and
that
was
done
on
this
case.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
that
is
felonies.
all
homicides
and
also
important
felonies,
that's
been
instated
in
bronx
county
before
i
came
up
there
as
chief
assistant.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
there
is
nothing
the
record
to
so
indicate.
there
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
the
record
does
show
that
there
was
--
it
was
a
21-floor-apartment
building
and
if
i
may
just
turn
to
my
--
21
floors,
we
just
don't
know
how
many
units.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
over
a
hundred
--
over
a
hundred
units.
it's
a
large
apartment
house.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
the
defensive
of
trial
was
alibi
and
the
defense
to
trial
was
that
this
confession
which
was
offered
an
evidence,
was
not
voluntary.
there
was
no
defense
that
he
was
unreasonably
detained.
in
fact,
it
was
the
contention
of
the
defense
during
the
course
of
this
trial
that
this
man
was
a
suspect,
that
this
man
was
thought
by
these
police
officers
to
have
committed
this
crime.
in
fact,
defense
counsel
that
everything
but
state
that
these
officers
had
probable
cause
or
reasonable
basis
for
believing
in
their
own
minds
subjectively
that
this
individual
had
committed
this
crime.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
yes
sir.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
there
are
two
volumes,
1340
pages.
i
might,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
event,
that
you
do
not
find
that
the
guidelines
established
by
terry
be
adhered
to
in
this
case.
though,
i
certainly
think
that
the
situation
of
office
in
mcfadden,
arresting
terry
by
seizing
him
and
preventing
him
from
movement
because
he
saw
terry
looking
into
various
windows
and
talking
to
somebody
then,
looking
in
these
windows
again.
if
that
is
appropriate
police
action
and
indeed
i
do
believe
it
is
appropriate
police
action.
then
certainly
in
this
case
where
police
officers
have
interrogated
numerous
individuals
where
they
have
a
reasonable
basis
for
interrogating
this
individual
melvin
morales
and
do
interrogate.
and
when
melvin
morales
has
an
opportunity
to
interpose
his
own
free
will
and
within
ten
minutes,
rather
he
admits
and
confesses
to
this
crime,
i
respectfully
submit
that
his
fourth
amendment
rights
have
not
been
violated.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
i
believe
it
was
two
days
there
--
it
was
two
days
thereafter
that
they
suddenly
discovered
that
he
is
not
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
that
is
correct
sir,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
they
made
inquiry
of
his
mother
prior
thereto.
they
made
inquiry
of
his
mother
due
to
the
fact
they
found
the
brother
snooky
in
the
hallway
that
same
morning.
they
did
make
inquiry
of
the
mother
following
the
description
given
to
them
by
everett
roberts
on
three
different
occasions
and
went
to
the
house
at
three
different
occasions.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
the
record
does
not
indicate
whether
he
live
with
the
mother.
there
is
an
indication
on
the
part
or
from
the
record
that
he
did
stay
several
times
a
week
with
his
mother.
and
according
to
the
mother,
he
was
with
the
mother
on
the
night
of
the
murder
or
was
in
that
apartment
the
night
of
the
murder,
where
the
crime
was
committed.
and
this
evidence
was
known
to
the
police,
prior
to
the
time
that
they
took
mr.
morales
into
custody
or
when
he
surrendered.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
she
stated
that
he
was
sleeping
on
the
dining
room
table
at
that
particular
time
and
that
when
the
police
arrived
at
the
apartment,
he
was
there,
sleeping
on
the
table
and
this
is
refuted
by
one
of
the
detectives,
i
believe
detective
teccera,
who
testified
that
he
walked
through
the
apartment
and
actually
walked
through
this
room
and
did
not
observe
anyone
sleeping
on
the
dining
room
table.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
the
mother
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
mr.
justice
black,
mrs.
morales
testified
here
that
he
was
sleeping
on
the
dining
room
table.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
during
the
time
of
the
murder
and
during
the
time
that
the
--
during
the
whole
evening,
he
was
there
and
that
during
the
time
that
the
police
came
to
interrogate
the
morales
family
in
a
particular,
snooky,
the
brother,
he
was
sleeping
on
the
dining
room
table.
that
is
on
the
record.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
i
would
say
about
4:00
-
4:30
in
the
morning,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
according
to
her,
he
came
to
the
apartment
and
didn't
say
any
further.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
according
to
mrs.
morales,
mr.
chief
justice.
according
to
the
detectives,
they
did
not
see
him
at
the
apartment.
they
did
not
see
him
at
his
usual
haunts.
and
mrs.
morales
stated
that
on
the
night
in
question,
on
the
night
or
the
early
morning
of
october
4th
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
detectives
did
not
enter
the
apartment.
this
is
refuted
by
the
detectives
who
said
they
did
enter
the
apartment
and
went
through
the
apartment,
and
did
not
see
mr.
morales
asleep
on
the
dining
room
table.
this
has
to
do
with
the
alibi
defense,
primarily,
doesn't
it?
it
does.
this
conflict.
i
--
with
respect
to
what's
really
an
issue
here,
as
i
understand
it,
that
is
the
fourth
amendment
claim.
this
--
the
mother
testified
that
she
telephoned
her
son
when
the
police
told
her
that
they
would
like
to
interrogate
the
son,
is
that
correct?
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
the
record
does
not
indicate
where
he
was
at
that
time,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
according
to
the
record,
he
lived
there
sporadically.
he
live
there
two
or
three
times
a
week
and
then
lived
elsewhere.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
the
bronx.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
the
record
does
not
so
indicate.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
they
were
unnoticed.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
on
that
night,
they
did
not
know
that
he
had
been
there.
it
was
only
subsequently
when
the
mother
stated
that
her
son
melvin
was
in
the
apartment,
that
they
were
able
to
piece
that
together.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
they
had
made
inquiry
about
seeing
him
prior
thereto
but
they
had
made
inquiry
to
the
mother
--
as
soon
as
they
made
inquiry
to
the
mother
about
seeing
him,
she
then
alibied
and
stated
that
he
was
in
the
apartment.
he
wasn't
outside
the
apartment.
he
was
here
sleeping
on
the
dining
room
table.
may
it
please
the
court?
in
the
event
that
this
court
finds
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
this
defendant,
i
respectfully
submit
it
was
attenuated.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
to
attenuation
in
the
event
that
this
court
finds,
there
was
an
unreasonable
seizure.
in
miranda,
it
was
discussed
the
taint
of
the
coercive
atmosphere
of
the
station
house.
in
the
miranda
case
decide
that
this
could
be
removed
by
a
full
and
fair
disclosure
of
defendant's
rights
to
silence
and
to
counsel.
by
identical
reason,
we
contend
here
that
the
confession
was
not
a
product
of
illegal
custody
but
was
the
result
of
this
man
interposing
his
own
free
will
and
confessing
to
a
detective
of
his
own
choice,
detective
carol.
he
refused
to
talk
to
detective
duff
but
insisted
on
talking
to
detective
downe
and
detective
carol,
and
when
detective
carol
asked
him
whether
he
believed
in
god,
and
asked
him
whether
or
not
between
god
and
himself
that
he
commit
this
crime,
he
stated
that
he
did.
and
i
submit
that
there
seems
to
coincide
with
the
state's
theory
that
this
was
a
voluntary
surrender.
the
fact
that
shortly
after
he
was
brought
to
the
station
house,
he
confessed
to
this
crime
within
10
minutes,
after
he
was
questioned
by
detective
carol.
in
conclusion,
the
people
submit
that
the
seizure
was
proper
under
the
fourth
amendment,
that
this
man
was
seized
not
based
solely
or
primarily
on
the
fact
that
he
was
a
narcotic
addict
but
based
on
the
fact
that
he
was
present
in
the
vicinity
at
the
time
the
crime
was
committed.
but
a
false
alibi
had
been
given
for
him
by
his
mother
that
he
was
not
found
in
the
usual
haunts,
that
he
had
a
reputation
of
being
a
petty
thief,
who
had
numerous
convictions,
and
was
known
to
have
numerous
convictions
by
the
detectives
assigned
on
this
case.
three,
i
respectfully
submit
that
there
was
a
voluntary
surrender
in
this
case
and
therefore
the
fourth
amendment.
they
not
even
come
into
play
with
regard
to
the
fact
situation
in
case
known
as
people
of
the
state
of
new
york
against
morales.
i
would
this
ask
this
--
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
assuming
there
was
no
surrender
here,
assuming
there
was
no
surrender,
in
this
case,
and
if
there
was
a
surrender,
certainly
the
fourth
amendment
would
not
come
into
play.
the
taking
of
the
custody,
the
detention,
the
seizure,
the
arrest,
a
melvin
morales
is
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
was
reasonable
and
appropriate
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
fourth
amendment
as
oppose
to
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
applies
a
flexible
and
variable
standard,
it
is
not
absolute
like
the
fifth
and
the
sixth.
guidelines
have
been
provided
by
terry
against
ohio,
and
i
submit
that
the
people
have
the
right
to
detain
someone
where
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
belief
that
that
individual
has
information
concerning
a
crime
which
has
been
committed.
justice
frankfurter
stated,
it
much
more
adequately
denied.
in
columbia,
in
which
he
said
there
are
things
which

that
it's
necessary
to
detain

to
interrogate
witnesses
who
possibly
maybe
suspects
in

to
ascertain
who

committee
a
particular

this
case
like
all
cases
appearing
before
this
court,
there
has
to
be
a
balancing
between
society
and
the
individual.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
whose
counsel
has
characterized
as
a
lamb
was
found
by
jury
of
his

to
have
delivered

upon,
the

individuals
and
before
this
investigation
was
over,
they
literally
questioned
over
a
hundred
individuals.
one
information
that
they
received
that
first
night,
they
knew
that
the
individual
or
possibly
the
individual
committed
this
crime
lived
in
that
building
because
one
of
the
tenants
after
the
elevator
arrived
upon
his
floor
heard
footsteps
below
this
particular
floor
and
heard
a
door.
they
questioned
individuals
in
the
building.
they
questioned
mrs.
morales.
they
questioned
her
son
snooky
and
the
evidence
indicates
in
the
record
is
all
we
have
to
go
on
is
that
two
individuals
were
interrogated
by
the
police
at
the
station
house.
snooky,
snooky
morales
and
a
man
by
the
name
of
shortie,
they
had
no
probable
cause
to
arrest
in
a
technical
sense
of
the
term
either
snooky
or
shortie.
but
i
respectfully
submit,
conducting
this
investigation
based
on
the
information
which
they
had.
they
had
a
reasonable
basis
to
detain
and
take
him
to
the
station
house,
these
two
individuals
had
questioned
him
and
checked
out
their
alibi.
ascertain
whether
or
not
these
individuals
could
clear
themselves
in
order
to
solve
this
crime
involving
mrs.
adi
brown.
they
could
never
revive
mrs.
adi
brown
but
it
was
incumbent
upon
these
police
officers,
characterized
as
petty
public
officials
to
work
from
day
break
to
back
break.
in
order
to
solve
this
crime,
so
there
would
not
be
more
adi
browns,
figuratively
speaking,
in
bronx
county
in
the
city
of
new
york.
they
had
to
work,
and
they
had
to
investigate,
and
they
had
to
interrogate,
and
i
respectfully
submit,
they
went
into
the
street
and
they
knew
these
police
officers.
they
knew
melvin
morales.
they
knew
melvin
morales
to
be
a
hustler
and
a
petty
thief
who
had
numerous
convictions
as
a
narcotic
addict.
as
a
policy,
they
knew
this
individual
and
they
knew
his
haunts,
and
they
looked
in
his
haunts.
and
this
individual
was
not
seen
in
this
familiar
haunts.
during
the
course
of
this
investigation
prior
to
the
time
that
melvin
morales
was
taken
to
the
station
house,
they
went
and
interviewed
the
mother.
detective
ferguson
spoke
to
the
mother.
detective
ferguson
was
told
by
the
mother
that
her
son
was
not
around,
that
she
had
not
seen
her
son
for
sometime.
subsequently,
several
days
later,
to
detective
carol
and
detective
downe,
when
she
discovered
they
was
searching
for
her
son
and
looking
for
her
son.
she
gave
an
alibi
for
her
son.
she
said,
“he
was
here.
he
was
here
in
the
apartment.
a
detective
had
gone
through
the
premises.
a
detective
who
knew
melvin

he
had
not
seen
melvin

in
the
apartment.
the
little
boy
and
his
age
doesn't
appear
on
the
record
or
in
the
record,
was
a
little
boy
who
had
a
kombi,
a
van,
and
this
little
boy
was
walking
his
friend
home
at
approximately
3:20
in
the
morning.
and
everett
roberts
according
to
the
testimony
in
this
record
and
i'm
not
going
to
comment
on
what
the
assistant
district
attorney
stated
concerning
his
testimony
at
this
time.
but
that
little
boy
described
to
the
police
prior
to
the
time
that
melvin
morales
was
detained
or
surrendered,
described
to
the
police
and
individual
a
receding
hairline,
a
puerto
rican,
thin.
and
indeed
the
description
matched
in
the
minds
of
the
detectives
who
are
working
on
this
case,
melvin
morales,
and
intensified
their
search
for
melvin
morales.
and
this
boy
in
court
identified
melvin
morales
as
the
individual
he
saw
at
the
time
of
a
homicide
and
this
little
boy
stated
that
he
saw
this
individual
on
the
day,
on
the
wednesday,
following
the
saturday
night
or
sunday
morning
that
he
saw
the
individual
at
the
bench
infront
of
this
building.
now,
the
court's
notion,
a
probable
cause
is
less
than
the
conservative
attitude
of
both
prosecutor
and
police
officials
with
regard
to
probable
cause,
as
evidence
by
the
peters
case.
and
i
state
to
this
court,
that
if
there
was
probable
cause
or
this
court
was
able
to
find
a
probable
cause
from
the
peters
case
or
in
the
peters
case.
certainly,
the
court
may
very
well
find
from
the
record
we
have
here,
which
we
were
not
able
to
develop
because
the
question
of
unreasonable
detention
was
never
raised
in
the
trial
court.
it's
not
raised
in
the
appellate
division
or
at
the
immediate
appellate
court
but
was
first
raised,
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
court
of
appeals.
certainly
if
it
was
raised,
i
respectfully
submit,
we'll
have
an
opportunity
to
develop
evidence
and
produce
evidence
which
show
how
all
of
these
information
into
hold
and
whether
or
not
indeed,
we
had
additional
information
which
would
enable
us
to
have
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest.
but
i
state
that
on
the
record
itself,
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
which
i
contend
is
all
at
the
fourth
amendment
requires,
a
reasonable
basis
to
detain
this
individual
in
order
to
interrogate
him
and
not
because
there
was
reasonable
belief
that
he
had
information
concerning
the
commission
of
this
crime.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
mr.
justice
harlan,
they
did
and
they
testified,
i
might
add
and
if
i
may
just
go
off
the
subject
that
i
have
now
and
go
back
to
voluntary
surrender
for
a
moment,
they
testified
that
they
saw
the
mother
and
stated
to
the
mother
that
they
were
looking.
they
were
looking
for
melvin
morales,
her
son
melvin
morales,
and
she
says,
“well,
he's
been
around.
he's
not
hiding.
i'll
tell
my
son
that
you're
looking
for
him
detective
carol.”
and
indeed,
she
called
up
her
son
and
this
is
the
testimony
in
the
trial,
testimony
of
mrs.
morales.
substantiated
in
part
by
melvin
morales
himself
when
he
testified
and
she
said,
“melvin,
detective
carol
wants
to
see
you.”
and
he
said,
“well,
i'll
see
him.”
she
says,
“well,
come
up
to
the
beauty
parlor.”
and
the
same
day
that
he
arrived
at
the
beauty
parlor,
she
spoke
to
that
son
and
told
him
where
she
would
be
and
she
then
told
detective
downe
and
detective
carol
that
her
son
would
be
at
the
beauty
parlor,
later
that
evening.
and
at
eight
o'clock,
the
son
arrived.
now,
he
knew
that
detective
carol
was
looking
for
him.
the
mother
stated,
“come
to
the
beauty
parlor.”
he
did
arrive
at
the
beauty
parlor.
detective
downe
and
detective
carol
were
there.
he
voluntarily
went
with
detective
downe
and
detective
carol
to
the
station
house.
this
certainly
is
different
from
the
davis
case
and
that
this
30-year-old
man
as
contrast
to
a
40-year-old
boy.
this
30-year-old
man
voluntarily
went
with
the
police
officers
to
the
station
house,
no
handcuffs,
no
chains,
no
gun,
with
detectives
whom
he
knew
and
whom
he
had
seen
certainly
for
the
last
13
years
of
his
life,
taken
to
the
station
house.
and
there
in
the
station
house,
interposing
his
own
free
will
within
10
to
50
minutes
after
detective
carol
was
advised
of
his
rights
prior
to
miranda,
told
that
he
didn't
have
to
say
anything,
that
anything
he
said
could
be
used
against
him
and
that
the
detective
would
testify
in
court
concerning
what
he
said.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
he
was
arrested
on
october
13th,
19
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
at
the
beauty
shop,
outside
the
beauty
shop,
sir.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
sir,
i
used
the
term
arrest,
the
constitutional
term
arrest,
when
the
person's
right
to
freedom
and
movement
is
interfered
with
i
considered
arrest.
i
consider
it
arrest
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
from
that
moment
on,
he
was
not
voluntarily
free
to
go,
sir.
according
to
the
testimony
of
detective
duff
and
detective
carol
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
sir?
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
the
basis
that
we
had
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
from
the
record
sir.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
from
the
record,
the
basis
that
we
have
to
arrest
him
is
circumstantial
evidence
indicating
that
the
person
who
committed
this
crime
was
a
tenant
in
that
building.
that
this
individual,
melvin
morales,
was
seen
outside
the
premises
of
the
building
contemporaneous
with
the
time
just
before
or
just
after
mrs.
adi
brown
was
killed
that
this
individual
was
a
narcotic
addict.
had
been
a
narcotic
addict
for
many
years,
that
this
individual
was
a
petty
thief,
that
this
individual
was
missing
from
haunts,
that
his
mother
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
i
just
stated
so
what's
in
the
record.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
they
know
it
sir.
they
were
questioned.
they
were
questioned
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
they
did
not
know
that
the
person
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
who
had
committed
the
crime
had
a
long
criminal
record
sir.
but
based
on
their
expertise,
the
expertise
of
a
police
officer
in
the
42nd
squad,
a
person
with
narcotic
background,
a
person
with
a
record
for
petty
thefts,
a
person
who
needed
to
make
a
score
in
order
to
support
his
habit
would
be
more
likely
to
commit
a
crime
such
as
this
in
an
elevator
at
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
than
the
president
of
the
chamber
of
commerce.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
there
are
many
people
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
i
can't
give
you,
i
can
--
in
my
opinion
sir,
there
are
about
60,000
narcotic
addicts
in
the
city
new
york
but
we
have
our
fair
share
in
bronx
county.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
and
a
fair
share
and
save
more
than
50%
of
them
to
make
crime.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
the
evidence
at
that
time
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
that
this
is
morales
is
the
facts
sir,
that
he
was
not
seen
in
his
usual
haunts
for
the
period
of
nine
days.
subsequent
to
this
crime,
that
the
mother
stated
at
first
that
he
was
not
in
the
apartment.
stated
subsequently
that
he
was
in
the
apartment,
that
a
boy
saw
him
sitting
on
a
bench
at
the
time
that
the
crime
had
been
committed
and
i
state
further,
sir,
that
when
i
use
the
term
arrest.
i
equate
it
with
seizure,
i
equate
it
with
detention
and
i
state
that
the
people
or
the
state
has
the
right
to
seize
someone
when
they
have
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
that
that
person
has
information
with
respect
to
a
crime.
and
in
equating
that
with
his
fourth
amendment
rights,
we
take
into
consideration
the
entire
totality
of
circumstances.
the
nature
of
the
crime
that
was
committed,
the
state
of
the
investigation,
the
individual
himself
who
has
been
seized
whether
or
not
the
atmosphere
of
the
station
house
would
be
so
coercive
to
such
an
individual
who
was
ringed
wise,
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
cope
or
would
be
so
coward,
that
his
statement
that
he
would
make
after
being
advised
of
his
rights
would
not
be
voluntary.
the
--
how
long
he
had
been
detained
and
certainly,
i
believe
that
when
one
is
seized,
on
the
basis
that
he
may
reasonably
have
information
with
regard
to
a
crime
that
that
detention
can
only
be
for
a
short
period
of
time,
rather
for
a
lengthy
period
of
time.
the
extent
of
time
that
this
man
was
seized
as
far
as
his
statement
concerning
his
complexity
in
this
crime
was
concerned,
was
of
10
to
15
minutes
sir.
and
based
on
most
facts
sir,
i
believe
that
under
the
fourth
amendment,
recognizing
that
the
statements
applied
by
the
fourth
amendment
are
flexible
and
variable,
that
the
totality
of
this
situation
warrants
the
action
taken
by
the
statement.
pardon
me,
sir,
mr.
justice.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
he
was
booked,
the
next
morning.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
he
did
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
he
was
not
booked
at
that
particular
time
because
at
that
time,
in
the
city
of
new
york,
there
was
no
24-hour
arraignment
and
he
could
not
be
arraigned
until
the
following
morning.
he
was
questioned
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
they
are
different.
he
was
not
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
he
could
have
been
booked
that
night,
he
was--
i
just
don't
know.
i
just
don't
know
that
of
it.
i
do
know
that
prior
to
the
time
that
he
would
be
booked,
it
is
a
procedure
which
we
have
established
that
an
assistant
da,
who
is
on
felony
duty,
reports
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
in
order
to
interrogate
the
individual,
advise
him
of
his
rights
even
prior
to
miranda
ascertain
whether
the
police
department
has
also
advised
this
individual
of
his
rights
in
order
to
ascertain
the
voluntariness
of
the
statement
which
this
individual
is
given.
and
that
was
done
on
this
case.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
that
is
felonies.
all
homicides
and
also
important
felonies,
that's
been
instated
in
bronx
county
before
i
came
up
there
as
chief
assistant.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
there
is
nothing
the
record
to
so
indicate.
there
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
the
record
does
show
that
there
was
--
it
was
a
21-floor-apartment
building
and
if
i
may
just
turn
to
my
--
21
floors,
we
just
don't
know
how
many
units.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
over
a
hundred
--
over
a
hundred
units.
it's
a
large
apartment
house.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
the
defensive
of
trial
was
alibi
and
the
defense
to
trial
was
that
this
confession
which
was
offered
an
evidence,
was
not
voluntary.
there
was
no
defense
that
he
was
unreasonably
detained.
in
fact,
it
was
the
contention
of
the
defense
during
the
course
of
this
trial
that
this
man
was
a
suspect,
that
this
man
was
thought
by
these
police
officers
to
have
committed
this
crime.
in
fact,
defense
counsel
that
everything
but
state
that
these
officers
had
probable
cause
or
reasonable
basis
for
believing
in
their
own
minds
subjectively
that
this
individual
had
committed
this
crime.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
yes
sir.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
there
are
two
volumes,
1340
pages.
i
might,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
event,
that
you
do
not
find
that
the
guidelines
established
by
terry
be
adhered
to
in
this
case.
though,
i
certainly
think
that
the
situation
of
office
in
mcfadden,
arresting
terry
by
seizing
him
and
preventing
him
from
movement
because
he
saw
terry
looking
into
various
windows
and
talking
to
somebody
then,
looking
in
these
windows
again.
if
that
is
appropriate
police
action
and
indeed
i
do
believe
it
is
appropriate
police
action.
then
certainly
in
this
case
where
police
officers
have
interrogated
numerous
individuals
where
they
have
a
reasonable
basis
for
interrogating
this
individual
melvin
morales
and
do
interrogate.
and
when
melvin
morales
has
an
opportunity
to
interpose
his
own
free
will
and
within
ten
minutes,
rather
he
admits
and
confesses
to
this
crime,
i
respectfully
submit
that
his
fourth
amendment
rights
have
not
been
violated.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
i
believe
it
was
two
days
there
--
it
was
two
days
thereafter
that
they
suddenly
discovered
that
he
is
not
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
that
is
correct
sir,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
they
made
inquiry
of
his
mother
prior
thereto.
they
made
inquiry
of
his
mother
due
to
the
fact
they
found
the
brother
snooky
in
the
hallway
that
same
morning.
they
did
make
inquiry
of
the
mother
following
the
description
given
to
them
by
everett
roberts
on
three
different
occasions
and
went
to
the
house
at
three
different
occasions.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
the
record
does
not
indicate
whether
he
live
with
the
mother.
there
is
an
indication
on
the
part
or
from
the
record
that
he
did
stay
several
times
a
week
with
his
mother.
and
according
to
the
mother,
he
was
with
the
mother
on
the
night
of
the
murder
or
was
in
that
apartment
the
night
of
the
murder,
where
the
crime
was
committed.
and
this
evidence
was
known
to
the
police,
prior
to
the
time
that
they
took
mr.
morales
into
custody
or
when
he
surrendered.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
she
stated
that
he
was
sleeping
on
the
dining
room
table
at
that
particular
time
and
that
when
the
police
arrived
at
the
apartment,
he
was
there,
sleeping
on
the
table
and
this
is
refuted
by
one
of
the
detectives,
i
believe
detective
teccera,
who
testified
that
he
walked
through
the
apartment
and
actually
walked
through
this
room
and
did
not
observe
anyone
sleeping
on
the
dining
room
table.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
the
mother
--
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
mr.
justice
black,
mrs.
morales
testified
here
that
he
was
sleeping
on
the
dining
room
table.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
during
the
time
of
the
murder
and
during
the
time
that
the
--
during
the
whole
evening,
he
was
there
and
that
during
the
time
that
the
police
came
to
interrogate
the
morales
family
in
a
particular,
snooky,
the
brother,
he
was
sleeping
on
the
dining
room
table.
that
is
on
the
record.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
i
would
say
about
4:00
-
4:30
in
the
morning,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
according
to
her,
he
came
to
the
apartment
and
didn't
say
any
further.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
according
to
mrs.
morales,
mr.
chief
justice.
according
to
the
detectives,
they
did
not
see
him
at
the
apartment.
they
did
not
see
him
at
his
usual
haunts.
and
mrs.
morales
stated
that
on
the
night
in
question,
on
the
night
or
the
early
morning
of
october
4th
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
detectives
did
not
enter
the
apartment.
this
is
refuted
by
the
detectives
who
said
they
did
enter
the
apartment
and
went
through
the
apartment,
and
did
not
see
mr.
morales
asleep
on
the
dining
room
table.
this
has
to
do
with
the
alibi
defense,
primarily,
doesn't
it?
it
does.
this
conflict.
i
--
with
respect
to
what's
really
an
issue
here,
as
i
understand
it,
that
is
the
fourth
amendment
claim.
this
--
the
mother
testified
that
she
telephoned
her
son
when
the
police
told
her
that
they
would
like
to
interrogate
the
son,
is
that
correct?
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
the
record
does
not
indicate
where
he
was
at
that
time,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
according
to
the
record,
he
lived
there
sporadically.
he
live
there
two
or
three
times
a
week
and
then
lived
elsewhere.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
the
bronx.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
the
record
does
not
so
indicate.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
they
were
unnoticed.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
on
that
night,
they
did
not
know
that
he
had
been
there.
it
was
only
subsequently
when
the
mother
stated
that
her
son
melvin
was
in
the
apartment,
that
they
were
able
to
piece
that
together.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
they
had
made
inquiry
about
seeing
him
prior
thereto
but
they
had
made
inquiry
to
the
mother
--
as
soon
as
they
made
inquiry
to
the
mother
about
seeing
him,
she
then
alibied
and
stated
that
he
was
in
the
apartment.
he
wasn't
outside
the
apartment.
he
was
here
sleeping
on
the
dining
room
table.
may
it
please
the
court?
in
the
event
that
this
court
finds
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
this
defendant,
i
respectfully
submit
it
was
attenuated.
mr.
burton
b.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
to
attenuation
in
the
event
that
this
court
finds,
there
was
an
unreasonable
seizure.
in
miranda,
it
was
discussed
the
taint
of
the
coercive
atmosphere
of
the
station
house.
in
the
miranda
case
decide
that
this
could
be
removed
by
a
full
and
fair
disclosure
of
defendant's
rights
to
silence
and
to
counsel.
by
identical
reason,
we
contend
here
that
the
confession
was
not
a
product
of
illegal
custody
but
was
the
result
of
this
man
interposing
his
own
free
will
and
confessing
to
a
detective
of
his
own
choice,
detective
carol.
he
refused
to
talk
to
detective
duff
but
insisted
on
talking
to
detective
downe
and
detective
carol,
and
when
detective
carol
asked
him
whether
he
believed
in
god,
and
asked
him
whether
or
not
between
god
and
himself
that
he
commit
this
crime,
he
stated
that
he
did.
and
i
submit
that
there
seems
to
coincide
with
the
state's
theory
that
this
was
a
voluntary
surrender.
the
fact
that
shortly
after
he
was
brought
to
the
station
house,
he
confessed
to
this
crime
within
10
minutes,
after
he
was
questioned
by
detective
carol.
in
conclusion,
the
people
submit
that
the
seizure
was
proper
under
the
fourth
amendment,
that
this
man
was
seized
not
based
solely
or
primarily
on
the
fact
that
he
was
a
narcotic
addict
but
based
on
the
fact
that
he
was
present
in
the
vicinity
at
the
time
the
crime
was
committed.
but
a
false
alibi
had
been
given
for
him
by
his
mother
that
he
was
not
found
in
the
usual
haunts,
that
he
had
a
reputation
of
being
a
petty
thief,
who
had
numerous
convictions,
and
was
known
to
have
numerous
convictions
by
the
detectives
assigned
on
this
case.
three,
i
respectfully
submit
that
there
was
a
voluntary
surrender
in
this
case
and
therefore
the
fourth
amendment.
they
not
even
come
into
play
with
regard
to
the
