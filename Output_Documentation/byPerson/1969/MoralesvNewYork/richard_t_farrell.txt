mr.
richard
t.
farrell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
richard
t.
farrell
for
the
petitioner,
melvin
morales.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
your
honors,
this
case
comes
to
this
court.
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
new
york
which
court
held
that
certain
police
activity
founded
upon
less
than
probable
cause,
do
not
constitute
a
violation
of
the
defendant's
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
did
not
in
fact
the
confessions
yielded
by
the
defendant
after
he
resist
as
we
contend
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
fairly
simply
set
forth
early
in
the
morning
of
october
4,
1964
in
bronx
county,
new
york.
mrs.
adi
brown
died
of
multiple
stab
wounds,
31
to
exact,
and
looked
upon
her
by
at
that
time
an
unknown
assailant
in
elevator
in
a
21-storey-apartment
house
in
a
public
housing
project
in
the
south
bronx.
police
efforts
at
the
scene
at
that
time
on
october
4th
yielded
no
leads.
but
on
october
5,
1964,
detective
aubrey
ferguson
was
walking
on
the
vicinity
of
the
scene
of
the
crime
and
met
mrs.
rebecca
morales
who
is
the
mother
of
the
petitioner
here
melvin
morales.
detective
ferguson
knew
the
morales
family
but
knew
them
at
a
different
address.
he
asked
mrs.
morales,
“what
are
you
doing
here?”
she
said,
“oh,
i
live
there,"
pointing
to
the
building
in
which
the
crime
had
been
committed.
the
police
also,
sometime
after
october
5th,
had
information
from
a
young
man
who
testified
on
the
trial
that
he
had
been
outside
the
premises
where
the
crime
was
committed
had
seen
someone
outside
the
building
at
the
pertinent
time.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
yes,
that's
everett
roberts,
mr.
justice
stewart
whose
testimony,
the
district
attorney
abandoned
in
the
submission
by
the
time,
it's
very
unusual,
we
try
this
case
in
the
supreme
court.
they
finished
cross-examining
this
young
fellow.
here,
the
crime
being
committed
sometime
in
october
or
november
or
december
of
1964.
and
i
doubt
very
much
if
he
could've
given
a
description
much
better
than
that
available
by
looking
at
page
1320
of
the
record
of
morales
as
a
skinny
puerto
rican
which
is
a
fairly
active
description
of
a
great
number
of
people
in
the
south
bronx.
but
on
october
11th,
the
police,
to
quote
again
from
the
testimony
of
detective
ferguson
about
page
742
in
the
record
said,
“we
rounded
up
some
of
the
neighborhood
narcotics
addicts,
and
probably
did
do
to
about
october
11,
1964.
the
police
officers
came
to
the
conclusion
that
morales
who
did
not
live
in
the
building
with
his
mother.
they
found
that
he
was
an
inhibitory
of
the
neighborhood
not
seen
around
by
who
we
don't
know
exactly
but
it
appears
where
these
narcotics
addicts
have
all
rounded
up
on
the
11th.
and
the
police
then
concentrated
the
records
on
trying
to
find
melvin
morales
to
talk
to.
the
principal
thrust
to
their
evidence
was
to
contact
his
mother,
mrs.
morales,
rebecca
morales,
telling
her
that
they
were
interested
in
speaking
to
melvin.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
attached
those
significance,
the
fact
that
the
officer,
we
rounded
up
these
other
narcotics
addicts.
unlike
the
--
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
well,
you
have
to
excuse
the
evocate
for
trying
to
use
what
i
consider
perhaps
a
loaded
term.
i
do
not
attach
any
significance
the
fact
that
there
was
a
round
up.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
mr.
chief
justice,
on
october
13th,
approximately
nine
days
after
the
event
that
led
to
the
homicide
investigation
of
the
murder
and
about
three
days
after
the
police
started
to
concentrate
to
the
evidence
on
finding
melvin
morales.
the
police
officers
followed
mrs.
morales
from
her
home
to
her
place
of
business
and
stayed
at
her
beauty
parlor.
about
her
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon,
mrs.
morales
was
visited
by
one
of
the
officers,
i
believe
it
was
detective
carol
who
asked
her,
“well,
do
you
think
your
son
will
be
around?”
she
said,
“well,
i
think
he
will
be
up
this
afternoon.”
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
testimony
in
the
record
by
mrs.
morales
indicates
very
clearly
that
she
had
informed
melvin
morales
that
the
police
were
interested
in
speaking
to
him
and
morales
seems
to
have
said,
“that's
alright
mother,
i
will
come
up.”
at
eight
o'
clock
that
evening,
on
october
13th,
melvin
morales
did
in
fact
come
up
to
his
mother's
beauty
parlor.
he
arrived
in
a
taxi
cab,
stepped
out
of
the
cab.
detective
carol
took
morales,
put
him
in
detective
downe's
car,
detective
downe
went
to
see
mrs.
morales
and
set
him
words
were
in
substance,
“come
on
outside,
we
have
your
son.
please,
pay
the
taxi
cab.”
mrs.
morales,
“may
i
talk
to
him?”
the
detective,
“no,
that
isn't
necessary.”
as
the
people
was
stating
the
facts
in
the
respondent's
brief
points
out,
the
officer
did
interfere
with
her
access
to
her
son.
the
police
officers
then
took
him
in
the
detective's
car,
down
to
42nd
precinct,
brought
him
upstairs
in
the
station
house,
put
him
in
the
lieutenant's
office,
and
commenced
the
process
of
interrogation.
downe
made
some
reference
to
the
following
rights
of
the
petitioner.
he
said
you
can
have
a
lawyer.
you
don't
have
to
talk
to
us
and
anything
you
say
to
us
may
be
used
against
you.
morales
declined
to
speak
to
downe
at
that
point,
said,
“i'd
rather
speak
to
detective
carol.”
detective
carol
returned
from
his
brief
departure
to
get
coffee
and
cake.
the
first
words
out
of
morales'
mouth
in
words
were
in
substance
were,
“carol,
you
know,
i
can't
take
a
beating.”
carol
replied
to
that,
“stop
building
offenses,
stop
making
alibis,
stop
building
threats
to
him.”
lean
on,
there's
one
thing
you
can't
do?
you
can't
lie
to
god.
do
you
believe
in
god?
morales,
“yes
i
do.”
“between
you
and
your
god,
did
you
do
this
thing?”
morales,
“yes,
i
did.”
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
from
the
time
that
morales
was
picked
up,
mr.
justice
douglas
until
--
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
until
the
time
interrogation
start
that
was
approximately
45
minutes.
from
about
8
o'clock
in
the
evening
on
october
13th
until
8:45
when
he
made
the
first
doubting
statement.
he
responded
the
question,
“did
you
do
it?
he
said
apparently
he
said,
“yes,
i
did.”
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
approximately
45
minutes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
45
minutes
after
the
initial
taking
into
custody
outside
his
mother's
beauty
parlor.
the
trip
to
the
station
house
--
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
it
was
40
--
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
it
would
seems
to
be
about
10
to
15
minutes,
your
honor.
it's
impossible
to
fix
the
time
with
any
precision.
it
was
45
minutes
in
the
initial
taking
of
the
custody
and
approximately
10
to
15
minutes
between
the
time
they
arrived
to
the
station
house
to
the
time
of
the
first
statement,
“yes,
i
did
it.”
carol
then
repeated
to
morales
substantially
the
same
warnings
given
to
him
by
detective
duff
earlier
and
morales
made
a
full-blown
verbal
confession
that
he
had
needed
narcotics.
he
had
been
in
his
mother's
apartment
and
got
outside
for
breath
of
air.
he
saw
a
woman
entering
the
building
followed
the
woman
into
the
building,
went
into
the
same
elevator
with
her
and
the
elevator
went
up.
he
snatched
at
her
purse,
she
resisted,
he
stabbed
her,
the
elevator
stopped,
and
he
fled.
at
that
point,
detective
downe
return
to
the
interrogation
site
and
downe
and
carol
made
essentially
this
observation
to
morales.
now,
since
you
and
morales
are
going
to
have
to
repeat
you
a
story
to
detective
of
a
homicide
squad
carrying
this
case,
precinct
detective
who's
in
charge
with
a
responsibility
in
this
case
and
perhaps
to
the
district
attorney
in
another
unspecified
list
of
police
officers.
why
don't
you
write
your
statement
down
so
no
one
change
it
on
you?
morales
complied
and
that
led
to
the
second
confession
in
this
case
or
polygraphic
statement
completed
about
9:05
on
october
13.
thereafter,
and
true
enough
to
the
police
officer's
words,
there
was
a
further
procession
of
police
officers
interrogating
morales.
they
substantially
reiterated
his
confessions.
later
on
in
the
evening,
an
assistant
district
attorney
for
bronx
county's
office
arrive
on
the
scene,
conducted
a
question
and
answer
session
with
morales,
with
the
aid
of
a
stenotype
recorder
and
then
after
that
session
was
completed
sometime
early
on
the
morning
of
october
14th.
now,
about
four-and-a-half
to
five
hours
after
the
initial
taking
into
custody,
morales
was
taken
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
where
he
reenacted
the
crime.
at
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
of
october
14th,
he
was
in
the
emergency
ward
of
morrisania
hospital
being
treated
for
what
appeared
to
be
narcotics
withdrawal
symptoms.
a
week
later,
around
october
20,
police
officers
visited
morales
in
bronx
house
of
detention.
they
said
they
wanted
to
talk
to
him
and
according
to
the
police
officers'
own
testimony,
at
that
point,
morales
had
formed
the
new
resolve.
he
said,
“no,
i
will
not
talk
to
you,
i
am
going
to
fight
this
thing,”
meaning,
obviously
the
charge
of
murder.
morales
was
duly
tried
and
convicted
in
the
bronx
county.
preliminary
hearing
in
the
question
of
voluntariness
of
his
confession
the
famous
huntley
hearing
in
new
york
mandated
by
this
court's
decision
in
jackson
versus
denno
was
held.
morales
did
not
testify
at
the
huntley
hearing,
the
trial
judge
found
his
confession
voluntary.
jury
was
charged
on
a
question
of
voluntariness,
the
jury
convicted,
morales
who
received
a
life
sentence.
the
appellate
division
of
the
police
department
in
new
york
affirmed
unanimously
without
an
opinion.
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
state
of
new
york
affirmed
again
unanimously
but
this
time,
with
an
opinion.
this
court
since
we
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
on
april
21,
1969.
your
honors,
at
the
time
the
police
officers
picked
up
melvin
morales,
they
knew
the
following
concrete
specific
information
about
it.
his
mother
lived
in
a
building
where
the
crime
was
committed.
he
was
a
narcotic's
addict.
he,
they
have
been
told,
had
not
been
seen
around
since
the
time
the
crime
was
committed.
and
that
your
honors
is
about
all
they
knew
about
melvin
morales.
armed
with
this
scanty
information,
the
police
officers
formed
a
very
obvious
intention
of
making
morales
into
their
custody
and
bringing
him
down
to
the
station
house
for
interrogation.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
said
in
its
opinion
that,
it
may
be
conceded
that
there
was
not
probable
cause.
they
did
not
make
a
finding
on
the
question
whether
there
was
a
probable
cause
and
i
submit
on
the
record
in
this
case.
and
especially
in
the
light
of
the
testimony
the
two
officers
who
picked
morales
up
in
the
first
place,
when
saying,
“well,
i
have
nothing
definitely
to
tie
him
to
the
crime.”
and
the
others
saying,
“i
was
dubious
about
his
connection
with
the
crime”,
and
it
wasn't
until
the
interrogation
brought
out
what
it
brought
out
that
he
was
convinced
he
was
guilty.
it's
quite
obviously
no
probable
cause.
further,
the
court
of
appeals
did
however
seem
to
make
the
finding,
a
finding
which
i
submit
is
probably
binding
on
this
court.
the
court
of
appeals
said
at
page
58
of
its
opinion
at
22
new
york
second,
the
record
does
not
support
a
finding
that
defendant
consented
to
his
detention
and
question.
it
says
the
court
of
appeals
in
fact
there
was
no
consent.
in
fact
there
was
no
probable
cause,
it
does
not
necessarily
make
this
issue
here
unreasonable.
we
must
examine
to
see
under
all
the
circumstances
whether
if
this
issue
here
it
was
reasonable
or
not.
the
court
of
appeals
of
course
is
writing
in
may
of
1968.
they
are
writing
without
the
benefit
of
the
elimination
supplied
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
davis
versus
mississippi,
decided
on
april
22nd,
the
day
after
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
this
case.
davis
versus
mississippi,
your
honors,
i
think
makes
it
painfully
clear
that
if
the
police
do
not
possess
probable
cause,
do
not
have
a
warrant,
they
cannot
take
a
citizen
off
the
street
and
bring
him
to
the
station
house.
the
only
thing
they
can
do
is
footnote
six
in
the
davis
opinion.
it
reminds
the
country,
the
only
thing
they
can
do
is
request
the
voluntary
cooperation
of
the
citizen.
morales
was
not
requested
to
voluntarily
cooperate.
he
was
grabbed
by
one
police
officer,
thrust
into
the
other
officer's
car,
and
take
him
down
to
the
station
house.
the
court
of
appeals
makes
the
almost
chronicle
observation.
the
defendant
testified
he
was
so
loosely
guarded
when
taken
from
the
car
to
the
station
that
he
could
have
safely
escaped.
well,
i
don't
know
about
that.
all
he
said
in
his
testimony,
at
page
9
to
15
in
the
record
is
that
the
police
officers
didn't
hold
them
by
each
arm.
but
the
court
of
appeals
own
but
this
was
a
reasonable
seizure
within
the
fourth
amendment.
no
probable
cause
and
therefore
caused
no
arrest,
couldn't
be
an
arrest,
there
was
no
basis
to
link
this
man
to
the
crime.
no
consent
to
the
court
of
appeals
here
but
the
question
is,
“was
it
reasonable
to
do
what
the
police
officers
did?”
and
then
marching
through
their
consideration
of
what
constituted
reasonableness,
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
there's
no
practical
alternative
of
taking
the
man
off
the
street
and
dragging
him
down
to
the
station
house.
the
police
station
is
a
better
place
to
interrogate
defendants.
we
iterate
on
oral
argument
and
they
say
in
the
brief.
that's
exactly
what
this
court
i
think
decided
miranda
versus
arizona
because
the
police
station
is
such
a
dandy
place
to
interrogate
suspects.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
your
honor,
the
first
time
of
the
fourth
amendment
claim
was
raised
in
this
case
was
by
me
in
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals.
first
time
in
this
case,
riley
versus
ohio
however,
that
is
the
--
that's
turning
just
been
point
out,
stands
for
the
proposition
that
once
the
contention
has
to
be
considered
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
that
question
is
probably
preserved
for
review
by
this
court.
and
your
honors,
the
court
of
appeals
quite
obviously
considered
this
question
as
a
brief
reading
of
its
opinion
will
indicate.
although
it
was
raised,
and
i
had
no
problems
about
it
admitting
that
writ,
the
question
was
raised
for
the
first
time
by
me
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
is
not
i
think
particularly
an
objection
to
this
court
considering
that
question
since
the
highest
court
in
new
york
is
considered
the
questions
probably
deserve
for
its
review
and
then
therefore
deserve
--
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
well,
that
is
--
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan,
it's
one
of
the
principal
scapegoats
built
into
the
respondent's
brief
in
this
case
or
we
may
have
more
evidence.
but
that
question
i
think
is
referable
to
the
proper
procedure
under
the
new
york
practice,
since
the
question
has
been
properly
preserved
for
review
by
this
court.
i
think
that
the
only
thing
that
the
people
can
rely
on
is
what
they
got
in
the
record
right
now.
they
could
perhaps
go
out
and
beat
the
bushes
now
five
years
after
the
event,
and
find
some
more
evidence.
perhaps
this
court
could
be
convinced
to
send
it
back
for
rehearing,
i
do
not
think
that
it's
necessary
on
the
state
of
the
record
and
especially
in
light
of
the
testimony
of
the
two
arresting
officers.
because
those
two
arresting
officers
had
nothing
even
remotely
approaching
in
their
view
of
probable
cause
to
make
the
seizure.
and
as
these
two,
if
you
will,
petty
officials
to
borrow
from
boyd
versus
the
united
states,
whose
determination
to
take
the
citizen
into
custody
that
are
on
the
review
in
this
court
in
this
case.
if
this
court
be
not
convinced
that
the
unconsented
to
seizure
of
a
citizen
for
the
purposes
of
bringing
them
into
the
police
station
for
interrogation
does
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
then
i
quite
frankly
confessed
a
bit
of
confusion
about
what
the
opinion
of
davis
versus
mississippi
was
driving
at.
but
the
--
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
i
don't
think
terry
versus
ohio,
sibron
and
when
or
to
repeat
this
have
any
bearing
on
this
case
at
all,
mr.
justice
harlan
except
for
the
very
general
proposition
that
the
police
may
make
some
temporary
stoppage
of
a
citizen
if
there
is
a
reason
to
inquire
his
suspicious
conduct.
the
only
thing
the
police
officers
saw
that
morales
do
was
to
get
out
of
a
taxi
cab.
that's
hardly
the
kind
of
conduct,
i
think,
that
terry
envisions.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
certainly
were.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
oh,
they
were
there
because
they
were
looking
for
melvin
morales.
but
it's
the
reason
why
they
were
looking
for
melvin
morales,
that
makes
the
seizure
here
unreasonable
within
the
ambit
of
the
fourth
amendment.
they
were
not
operating
on
anything
that
remotely
approaching
probable
cause
for
his
arrest.
they
had
nothing
but
a
bare
suspicion
that
he
might
have
something
to
tell
them
about
the
crime
since
of
course,
his
family
lived
in
the
building.
he
was
an
addict
and
he
had
not
been
seen
around.
this
hardly,
intellectively
points
the
finger
of
suspicion
at
morales.
the
court
of
appeals
have
to
checkerboard
square
of
investigation
pointed
only
to
morales
but
at
most,
to
give
the
people
their
due,
four
out
of
those
64
squares
on
any
checkerboard
were
filled
in
here.
that
hardly,
i
think
mounts
up
to
a
kind
of
justification
for
a
seizure
and
detention
of
a
citizen
as
into
this
case.
to
say
that,
since
morales
knew
the
police
was
looking
for
him
that
he
is
coming
to
his
mother's
beauty
parlor,
may
be
read
as
a
surrender
flies
in
the
face
of
both
the
determination
by
new
york
court
of
appeals,
that
there
was
nothing
in
this
record
to
support
a
consent
of
argument.
and
there's
also
tantamount
in
my
opinion
to
saying
that
a
lamb
that
goes
to
the
pasture
and
surrenders
himself
to
the
wolf.
morales
wanted
to
surrender
to
the
police.
there
are
better
places
to
surrender
to
the
police
than
your
mother's
beauty
parlor.
there
are
police
stations,
many
of
them.
but
morales,
i
don't
think
can
be
said
to
have
surrendered
in
this
case.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
has
decided
that
question
that
there
was
no
surrender,
no
consent
to
interrogation
at
that
place
under
the
circumstances.
and
since
that
is
a
determination,
i
believe
on
the
question
of
fact
by
the
highest
court
in
the
state
of
new
york.
i
do
not
think
that
that
question
of
fact
is
reviewable
by
this
court.
but
if
the
court
be
convinced
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
it
becomes
another
more
pressing
problem.
if
the
fourth
amendment
was
violated,
what
affect
does
should
that
have
on
the
use
of
morales'
confessions.
taking
my
lead
from
the
american
law
institutes
modal
code
of
pre-arraignment
procedures
especially
article
ix
of
that
document
and
from
wong
sun
versus
the
united
states.
i
believe
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
once
the
confessions
are
taken
so
close,
at
least
the
point
of
time,
to
an
unreasonable
seizure
within
the
fourth
amendment.
those
confessions
must
be
barred
from
evidence
without
reference
to
the
fact
of
the
voluntariness
or
no.
as
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again,
the
purpose
behind
the
exclusion
of
every
rule
is
to
discourage
the
police
from
engaging
into
prohibited
conduct.
prohibited
conduct
here
is
an
investigatory
detention
upon
less
than
probably
cause.
the
involuntary
submission
of
the
citizen
to
the
custody
in
the
police
station,
if
the
fourth
amendment
is
to
be
protected
in
this
conduct,
in
this
context,
the
confessions
obtained
at
the
police
station
just
by
john
davis,
his
fingerprints
in
davis
case
must
be
barred
from
evidence,
whether
they
were
voluntary
or
not.
the
next
step,
of
course,
is
that
the
court
not
be
willing
to
buy
a
rule
based
upon
per
se
exclusion.
we
then
come
to
the
question,
was
there
the
kind
of
attenuation
between
the
initial
police
illegality,
that
is
the
seizure
of
morales
on
the
street
corner
and
his
confessions
that
would
permit
the
court
to
say
that
there
has
been
a
dissipation
of
the
primary
obtained.
again,
the
leading
case
is
wong
sun
versus
the
united
states.
their
blocky
toy
was
confession
was
excluded
from
evidence,
were
seized
in
his
own
premises
made
admissions
almost
immediately.
wong
sun
took
off,
was
at
large
for
several
days,
then
came
back,
and
made
his
confessions,
as
to
wong
sun
came
to
the
primary
illegality
of
any
uncertain
and
unanticipated
with,
as
to
blocky
toy
as
to
melvin
morales
in
this
case.
the
link
between
the
illegal
police
activity
of
seizing
morales
without
probable
cause
and
taking
him
without
his
consent
into
the
custody
is
so
closely
linked
both
in
time
and
in
circumstances.
because
morales
was
taken
down
to
the
police
station
and
interrogated
almost
immediately,
the
mere
fact
of
interposition
of,
well,
i
think
the
properly
called
that
that's
point
in
time
escobedo
warnings,
should
not
by
and
off
themselves
be
a
sufficient
attenuation
of
attained.
the
oppressiveness
of
the
initial
seizure
was
followed
by
the
oppressiveness
of
the
detention
at
the
place
selected
by
the
police
which
was
followed
by
the
oppressiveness
of
the
isolation
from
everyone
else
in
the
world
but
the
police,
which
is
followed
in
short
order
by
the
confessions.
the
link
between
these
confessions
and
the
seizure
is
so
close
both
in
time
and
in
circumstances
that
i
believe
your
honors
that
it
cannot
be
reasonably
said
in
the
realistic
appraisal
of
this
record.
that
there
has
been
a
kind
of
attenuation
between
the
unlawful
police
conduct
in
the
first
place
violating
the
principles
unasked
by
this
court
less
than
seven
months
ago
in
davis
versus
mississippi
and
the
confessions
to
say
that
the
confessions
are
not
the
tainted
produce
of
this
initial
police
illegality.
and
further
your
honors,
we
submit
that
the
confessions
of
the
defendant,
each
and
every
one
of
them
were
not
proven
to
be
voluntary
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
he
did
confess,
he
was
one
but
he
was
a
narcotics
addict.
a
group
prone
to
beguiles
to
have
a
rather
shallow
perception
of
their
rights
and
responsibilities.
he
was
isolated
from
his
only,
only
ally
in
the
field,
his
mother,
who
testified
that
she
wanted
to
tell
him
that
he
shouldn't
speak
to
police
officers.
he
was
alone
in
the
police
station.
he
was
isolated.
he
did
after
the
effect
but
as
haley
versus
ohio,
i
think
indicates
is
also
remained
to
look
after
the
fact
for
the
--
for
whatever
light,
the
subsequent
events
may
throw
on
his
gun
before
him.
after
that
he
did
wind
up
in
the
emergency
ward
of
morrisania
hospital
being
treated
for
what's
looked
like,
narcotics
withdrawal
symptoms
and
when
he
have
been
completely
free
of
that
is
of
police
custody.
when
he
was
completely
alone
for
several
days
to
cogitate,
ruminate
over
the
possibilities
of
his
right
not
to
speak
to
a
police
officer.
when
police
officers
arrived
on
october
20th,
morales
told
them
and
says,
“go
away,
i
don't
want
to
talk
to
you.”
removed
in
time
and
space
when
he
inherently
submit
inherently
coercive
atmosphere
surrounding
with
the
police
station,
morales
found
the
resolve
that
would've
stood
him
in
good
state,
if
he
had
been
in
the
position
to
assert
that
result
at
the
time
it
was
initially
taken
into
custody.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
mr.
justice
harlan,
at
the
time
he
was
arrested,
he
was
partially
30
years
of
age.
he'd
been
a
narcotics
addict
since
he
was
17
years
old.
graduated
from
junior
high
school,
had
some
trade
school
experience.
he
had
a
yellow
sheet,
the
arrest
record
in
new
york
is
called,
of
course
the
yellow
sheet
of
some
sizeable
dimension.
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
is
no
obey
than
would
this
was,
may
have
familiar
with
the
criminal
processes
and
to
buttress
their
conclusion
of
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
city.
he
was
so
familiar
with
the
kind
of
processes
that
he
chose
not
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
it
was
unlawfully
arrested,
but
he
morales
that
i'm
speaking
of
morales
chose
to
rely
on
the
stronger
argument
that
is
fourth
amendment
rights
that
was
violated.
your
honors,
i
thought
of
that
argument
not
both
in
morales
the
experience
to
the
criminal.
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
30
years
of
age,
your
honor,
i
submit,
the
fact
that
he
had
a
rather
extensive
criminal
record.
this
make
him
an
expert
on
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
fourth
amendment,
the
fifth,
the
sixth,
the
fourteenth
and
also,
i
find
that
the
requirement
that
issues
be
raised
in
the
normal
cause
of
events
at
the
trial
court.
here,
however,
he
had
the
--
he
couldn't
afford
a
better
lawyer,
so
he
got
someone
who
made
really
an
error
but
raised
the
issue
that
this
court
must
now
decide.
can
this
confession
or
these
confessions
be
admitted
in
light
of
the
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
rights?
your
honors,
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
very
briefly,
i
like
to
return
the
court's
attention
to
two
items
of
testimony
that
appear
on
the
record.
in
spite
of
the
intricate
complex
of
facts
upon
which
the
police
officers
might
have
operated
to
seize
morales,
we
have
summarized
that
our
brief
on
pages
13
and
14
and
over
the
15th,
the
facts
upon
which
they
actually
did
operate.
they
actually
operated
on
a
soonest
of
evidence,
so
slim
that
one
police
officer
when
asked
whether
morales
is
a
suspect
or
not,
was
led
to
this
remark.
he
said,
why
is
--
it
was
asked,
was
morales
a
suspect?
and
after
they
have
been
given
a
lead
by
the
trial
judge,
the
officer
said,
i
concur
with
the
judge
everybody
is
a
suspect.
the
reach
of
the
police
officers
here
is
not
limited
to
melvin
morales,
but
these
petty
officials
to
borrow
i
was
wrong
as
from
james
otis
to
speak
in
1761.
the
police
officers
here,
these
petty
officials
have
it
in
their
power
to
determine,
who
is
the
suspect
and
we
know
now
from
the
police
officer,
who
is
the
suspect?
it
is
thee
and
me
your
honors.
and
the
second
point
to
which
i
would
like
to
address
the
court's
attention
was
that
the
attack
on
the
admissibility
of
morales'
confessions
is
not
an
attempt
to
find
the
way
around
otherwise,
overwhelming
proof
of
guilt.
absent
morales'
confessions,
there
is
nothing
to
tie
him
to
the
crime
committed
in
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
close
that,
it
is
clear
that
he
was
worrying
on
the
night
in
question
had
been
turned
on
a
cleaning
establishment
on
october
5th?
to
whom
that
the
claiming
stab
wounds
found
no
traces
of
blood
on
that
clothes
--
on
those
clothes
and
the
police
laboratory
in
examining
those
clothes
found
no
traces
of
blood.
if
your
honors
look
at
the
pictures
in
the
record
from
the
scene
of
the
crime,
there
is
blood
on
the
floor,
there
is
blood
on
the
wall,
there
is
blood
on
the
door.
morales'
clothes
showed
no
signs
of
blood
and
it
is
the
people's
own
testimony
that
points
to
these
clothes
as
the
clothes
being
worn
by
morales
on
the
night
this
crime
was
supposed
to
have
been
committed.
the
only
item
of
clothing
missing
were
his
shoes
but
his
trousers,
if
you
look
at
the
pictures
in
the
record,
your
honors,
how
his
trousers
could've
escaped
being
covered
with
blood
and
door
house.
31-stabwound
victim
or
alleged
victim
could
not
have
bled
on
him.
it
trenches
upon
almost
a
lack
of
proof
of
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
absent
these
confessions.
and
your
honors,
as
i
think
the
court
will
understand
our
position
is
that
the
confessions
on
the
produce
of
an
unlawful
seizure
and
must
therefore
be
barred
from
use
on
this
trial.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
richard
t.
farrell
for
the
petitioner,
melvin
morales.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
your
honors,
this
case
comes
to
this
court.
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
new
york
which
court
held
that
certain
police
activity
founded
upon
less
than
probable
cause,
do
not
constitute
a
violation
of
the
defendant's
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
did
not
in
fact
the
confessions
yielded
by
the
defendant
after
he
resist
as
we
contend
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
fairly
simply
set
forth
early
in
the
morning
of
october
4,
1964
in
bronx
county,
new
york.
mrs.
adi
brown
died
of
multiple
stab
wounds,
31
to
exact,
and
looked
upon
her
by
at
that
time
an
unknown
assailant
in
elevator
in
a
21-storey-apartment
house
in
a
public
housing
project
in
the
south
bronx.
police
efforts
at
the
scene
at
that
time
on
october
4th
yielded
no
leads.
but
on
october
5,
1964,
detective
aubrey
ferguson
was
walking
on
the
vicinity
of
the
scene
of
the
crime
and
met
mrs.
rebecca
morales
who
is
the
mother
of
the
petitioner
here
melvin
morales.
detective
ferguson
knew
the
morales
family
but
knew
them
at
a
different
address.
he
asked
mrs.
morales,
“what
are
you
doing
here?”
she
said,
“oh,
i
live
there,"
pointing
to
the
building
in
which
the
crime
had
been
committed.
the
police
also,
sometime
after
october
5th,
had
information
from
a
young
man
who
testified
on
the
trial
that
he
had
been
outside
the
premises
where
the
crime
was
committed
had
seen
someone
outside
the
building
at
the
pertinent
time.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
yes,
that's
everett
roberts,
mr.
justice
stewart
whose
testimony,
the
district
attorney
abandoned
in
the
submission
by
the
time,
it's
very
unusual,
we
try
this
case
in
the
supreme
court.
they
finished
cross-examining
this
young
fellow.
here,
the
crime
being
committed
sometime
in
october
or
november
or
december
of
1964.
and
i
doubt
very
much
if
he
could've
given
a
description
much
better
than
that
available
by
looking
at
page
1320
of
the
record
of
morales
as
a
skinny
puerto
rican
which
is
a
fairly
active
description
of
a
great
number
of
people
in
the
south
bronx.
but
on
october
11th,
the
police,
to
quote
again
from
the
testimony
of
detective
ferguson
about
page
742
in
the
record
said,
“we
rounded
up
some
of
the
neighborhood
narcotics
addicts,
and
probably
did
do
to
about
october
11,
1964.
the
police
officers
came
to
the
conclusion
that
morales
who
did
not
live
in
the
building
with
his
mother.
they
found
that
he
was
an
inhibitory
of
the
neighborhood
not
seen
around
by
who
we
don't
know
exactly
but
it
appears
where
these
narcotics
addicts
have
all
rounded
up
on
the
11th.
and
the
police
then
concentrated
the
records
on
trying
to
find
melvin
morales
to
talk
to.
the
principal
thrust
to
their
evidence
was
to
contact
his
mother,
mrs.
morales,
rebecca
morales,
telling
her
that
they
were
interested
in
speaking
to
melvin.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
attached
those
significance,
the
fact
that
the
officer,
we
rounded
up
these
other
narcotics
addicts.
unlike
the
--
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
well,
you
have
to
excuse
the
evocate
for
trying
to
use
what
i
consider
perhaps
a
loaded
term.
i
do
not
attach
any
significance
the
fact
that
there
was
a
round
up.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
mr.
chief
justice,
on
october
13th,
approximately
nine
days
after
the
event
that
led
to
the
homicide
investigation
of
the
murder
and
about
three
days
after
the
police
started
to
concentrate
to
the
evidence
on
finding
melvin
morales.
the
police
officers
followed
mrs.
morales
from
her
home
to
her
place
of
business
and
stayed
at
her
beauty
parlor.
about
her
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon,
mrs.
morales
was
visited
by
one
of
the
officers,
i
believe
it
was
detective
carol
who
asked
her,
“well,
do
you
think
your
son
will
be
around?”
she
said,
“well,
i
think
he
will
be
up
this
afternoon.”
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
testimony
in
the
record
by
mrs.
morales
indicates
very
clearly
that
she
had
informed
melvin
morales
that
the
police
were
interested
in
speaking
to
him
and
morales
seems
to
have
said,
“that's
alright
mother,
i
will
come
up.”
at
eight
o'
clock
that
evening,
on
october
13th,
melvin
morales
did
in
fact
come
up
to
his
mother's
beauty
parlor.
he
arrived
in
a
taxi
cab,
stepped
out
of
the
cab.
detective
carol
took
morales,
put
him
in
detective
downe's
car,
detective
downe
went
to
see
mrs.
morales
and
set
him
words
were
in
substance,
“come
on
outside,
we
have
your
son.
please,
pay
the
taxi
cab.”
mrs.
morales,
“may
i
talk
to
him?”
the
detective,
“no,
that
isn't
necessary.”
as
the
people
was
stating
the
facts
in
the
respondent's
brief
points
out,
the
officer
did
interfere
with
her
access
to
her
son.
the
police
officers
then
took
him
in
the
detective's
car,
down
to
42nd
precinct,
brought
him
upstairs
in
the
station
house,
put
him
in
the
lieutenant's
office,
and
commenced
the
process
of
interrogation.
downe
made
some
reference
to
the
following
rights
of
the
petitioner.
he
said
you
can
have
a
lawyer.
you
don't
have
to
talk
to
us
and
anything
you
say
to
us
may
be
used
against
you.
morales
declined
to
speak
to
downe
at
that
point,
said,
“i'd
rather
speak
to
detective
carol.”
detective
carol
returned
from
his
brief
departure
to
get
coffee
and
cake.
the
first
words
out
of
morales'
mouth
in
words
were
in
substance
were,
“carol,
you
know,
i
can't
take
a
beating.”
carol
replied
to
that,
“stop
building
offenses,
stop
making
alibis,
stop
building
threats
to
him.”
lean
on,
there's
one
thing
you
can't
do?
you
can't
lie
to
god.
do
you
believe
in
god?
morales,
“yes
i
do.”
“between
you
and
your
god,
did
you
do
this
thing?”
morales,
“yes,
i
did.”
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
from
the
time
that
morales
was
picked
up,
mr.
justice
douglas
until
--
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
until
the
time
interrogation
start
that
was
approximately
45
minutes.
from
about
8
o'clock
in
the
evening
on
october
13th
until
8:45
when
he
made
the
first
doubting
statement.
he
responded
the
question,
“did
you
do
it?
he
said
apparently
he
said,
“yes,
i
did.”
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
approximately
45
minutes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
45
minutes
after
the
initial
taking
into
custody
outside
his
mother's
beauty
parlor.
the
trip
to
the
station
house
--
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
it
was
40
--
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
it
would
seems
to
be
about
10
to
15
minutes,
your
honor.
it's
impossible
to
fix
the
time
with
any
precision.
it
was
45
minutes
in
the
initial
taking
of
the
custody
and
approximately
10
to
15
minutes
between
the
time
they
arrived
to
the
station
house
to
the
time
of
the
first
statement,
“yes,
i
did
it.”
carol
then
repeated
to
morales
substantially
the
same
warnings
given
to
him
by
detective
duff
earlier
and
morales
made
a
full-blown
verbal
confession
that
he
had
needed
narcotics.
he
had
been
in
his
mother's
apartment
and
got
outside
for
breath
of
air.
he
saw
a
woman
entering
the
building
followed
the
woman
into
the
building,
went
into
the
same
elevator
with
her
and
the
elevator
went
up.
he
snatched
at
her
purse,
she
resisted,
he
stabbed
her,
the
elevator
stopped,
and
he
fled.
at
that
point,
detective
downe
return
to
the
interrogation
site
and
downe
and
carol
made
essentially
this
observation
to
morales.
now,
since
you
and
morales
are
going
to
have
to
repeat
you
a
story
to
detective
of
a
homicide
squad
carrying
this
case,
precinct
detective
who's
in
charge
with
a
responsibility
in
this
case
and
perhaps
to
the
district
attorney
in
another
unspecified
list
of
police
officers.
why
don't
you
write
your
statement
down
so
no
one
change
it
on
you?
morales
complied
and
that
led
to
the
second
confession
in
this
case
or
polygraphic
statement
completed
about
9:05
on
october
13.
thereafter,
and
true
enough
to
the
police
officer's
words,
there
was
a
further
procession
of
police
officers
interrogating
morales.
they
substantially
reiterated
his
confessions.
later
on
in
the
evening,
an
assistant
district
attorney
for
bronx
county's
office
arrive
on
the
scene,
conducted
a
question
and
answer
session
with
morales,
with
the
aid
of
a
stenotype
recorder
and
then
after
that
session
was
completed
sometime
early
on
the
morning
of
october
14th.
now,
about
four-and-a-half
to
five
hours
after
the
initial
taking
into
custody,
morales
was
taken
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
where
he
reenacted
the
crime.
at
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
of
october
14th,
he
was
in
the
emergency
ward
of
morrisania
hospital
being
treated
for
what
appeared
to
be
narcotics
withdrawal
symptoms.
a
week
later,
around
october
20,
police
officers
visited
morales
in
bronx
house
of
detention.
they
said
they
wanted
to
talk
to
him
and
according
to
the
police
officers'
own
testimony,
at
that
point,
morales
had
formed
the
new
resolve.
he
said,
“no,
i
will
not
talk
to
you,
i
am
going
to
fight
this
thing,”
meaning,
obviously
the
charge
of
murder.
morales
was
duly
tried
and
convicted
in
the
bronx
county.
preliminary
hearing
in
the
question
of
voluntariness
of
his
confession
the
famous
huntley
hearing
in
new
york
mandated
by
this
court's
decision
in
jackson
versus
denno
was
held.
morales
did
not
testify
at
the
huntley
hearing,
the
trial
judge
found
his
confession
voluntary.
jury
was
charged
on
a
question
of
voluntariness,
the
jury
convicted,
morales
who
received
a
life
sentence.
the
appellate
division
of
the
police
department
in
new
york
affirmed
unanimously
without
an
opinion.
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
state
of
new
york
affirmed
again
unanimously
but
this
time,
with
an
opinion.
this
court
since
we
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
on
april
21,
1969.
your
honors,
at
the
time
the
police
officers
picked
up
melvin
morales,
they
knew
the
following
concrete
specific
information
about
it.
his
mother
lived
in
a
building
where
the
crime
was
committed.
he
was
a
narcotic's
addict.
he,
they
have
been
told,
had
not
been
seen
around
since
the
time
the
crime
was
committed.
and
that
your
honors
is
about
all
they
knew
about
melvin
morales.
armed
with
this
scanty
information,
the
police
officers
formed
a
very
obvious
intention
of
making
morales
into
their
custody
and
bringing
him
down
to
the
station
house
for
interrogation.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
said
in
its
opinion
that,
it
may
be
conceded
that
there
was
not
probable
cause.
they
did
not
make
a
finding
on
the
question
whether
there
was
a
probable
cause
and
i
submit
on
the
record
in
this
case.
and
especially
in
the
light
of
the
testimony
the
two
officers
who
picked
morales
up
in
the
first
place,
when
saying,
“well,
i
have
nothing
definitely
to
tie
him
to
the
crime.”
and
the
others
saying,
“i
was
dubious
about
his
connection
with
the
crime”,
and
it
wasn't
until
the
interrogation
brought
out
what
it
brought
out
that
he
was
convinced
he
was
guilty.
it's
quite
obviously
no
probable
cause.
further,
the
court
of
appeals
did
however
seem
to
make
the
finding,
a
finding
which
i
submit
is
probably
binding
on
this
court.
the
court
of
appeals
said
at
page
58
of
its
opinion
at
22
new
york
second,
the
record
does
not
support
a
finding
that
defendant
consented
to
his
detention
and
question.
it
says
the
court
of
appeals
in
fact
there
was
no
consent.
in
fact
there
was
no
probable
cause,
it
does
not
necessarily
make
this
issue
here
unreasonable.
we
must
examine
to
see
under
all
the
circumstances
whether
if
this
issue
here
it
was
reasonable
or
not.
the
court
of
appeals
of
course
is
writing
in
may
of
1968.
they
are
writing
without
the
benefit
of
the
elimination
supplied
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
davis
versus
mississippi,
decided
on
april
22nd,
the
day
after
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
this
case.
davis
versus
mississippi,
your
honors,
i
think
makes
it
painfully
clear
that
if
the
police
do
not
possess
probable
cause,
do
not
have
a
warrant,
they
cannot
take
a
citizen
off
the
street
and
bring
him
to
the
station
house.
the
only
thing
they
can
do
is
footnote
six
in
the
davis
opinion.
it
reminds
the
country,
the
only
thing
they
can
do
is
request
the
voluntary
cooperation
of
the
citizen.
morales
was
not
requested
to
voluntarily
cooperate.
he
was
grabbed
by
one
police
officer,
thrust
into
the
other
officer's
car,
and
take
him
down
to
the
station
house.
the
court
of
appeals
makes
the
almost
chronicle
observation.
the
defendant
testified
he
was
so
loosely
guarded
when
taken
from
the
car
to
the
station
that
he
could
have
safely
escaped.
well,
i
don't
know
about
that.
all
he
said
in
his
testimony,
at
page
9
to
15
in
the
record
is
that
the
police
officers
didn't
hold
them
by
each
arm.
but
the
court
of
appeals
own
but
this
was
a
reasonable
seizure
within
the
fourth
amendment.
no
probable
cause
and
therefore
caused
no
arrest,
couldn't
be
an
arrest,
there
was
no
basis
to
link
this
man
to
the
crime.
no
consent
to
the
court
of
appeals
here
but
the
question
is,
“was
it
reasonable
to
do
what
the
police
officers
did?”
and
then
marching
through
their
consideration
of
what
constituted
reasonableness,
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
there's
no
practical
alternative
of
taking
the
man
off
the
street
and
dragging
him
down
to
the
station
house.
the
police
station
is
a
better
place
to
interrogate
defendants.
we
iterate
on
oral
argument
and
they
say
in
the
brief.
that's
exactly
what
this
court
i
think
decided
miranda
versus
arizona
because
the
police
station
is
such
a
dandy
place
to
interrogate
suspects.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
your
honor,
the
first
time
of
the
fourth
amendment
claim
was
raised
in
this
case
was
by
me
in
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals.
first
time
in
this
case,
riley
versus
ohio
however,
that
is
the
--
that's
turning
just
been
point
out,
stands
for
the
proposition
that
once
the
contention
has
to
be
considered
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
that
question
is
probably
preserved
for
review
by
this
court.
and
your
honors,
the
court
of
appeals
quite
obviously
considered
this
question
as
a
brief
reading
of
its
opinion
will
indicate.
although
it
was
raised,
and
i
had
no
problems
about
it
admitting
that
writ,
the
question
was
raised
for
the
first
time
by
me
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
is
not
i
think
particularly
an
objection
to
this
court
considering
that
question
since
the
highest
court
in
new
york
is
considered
the
questions
probably
deserve
for
its
review
and
then
therefore
deserve
--
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
well,
that
is
--
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan,
it's
one
of
the
principal
scapegoats
built
into
the
respondent's
brief
in
this
case
or
we
may
have
more
evidence.
but
that
question
i
think
is
referable
to
the
proper
procedure
under
the
new
york
practice,
since
the
question
has
been
properly
preserved
for
review
by
this
court.
i
think
that
the
only
thing
that
the
people
can
rely
on
is
what
they
got
in
the
record
right
now.
they
could
perhaps
go
out
and
beat
the
bushes
now
five
years
after
the
event,
and
find
some
more
evidence.
perhaps
this
court
could
be
convinced
to
send
it
back
for
rehearing,
i
do
not
think
that
it's
necessary
on
the
state
of
the
record
and
especially
in
light
of
the
testimony
of
the
two
arresting
officers.
because
those
two
arresting
officers
had
nothing
even
remotely
approaching
in
their
view
of
probable
cause
to
make
the
seizure.
and
as
these
two,
if
you
will,
petty
officials
to
borrow
from
boyd
versus
the
united
states,
whose
determination
to
take
the
citizen
into
custody
that
are
on
the
review
in
this
court
in
this
case.
if
this
court
be
not
convinced
that
the
unconsented
to
seizure
of
a
citizen
for
the
purposes
of
bringing
them
into
the
police
station
for
interrogation
does
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
then
i
quite
frankly
confessed
a
bit
of
confusion
about
what
the
opinion
of
davis
versus
mississippi
was
driving
at.
but
the
--
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
i
don't
think
terry
versus
ohio,
sibron
and
when
or
to
repeat
this
have
any
bearing
on
this
case
at
all,
mr.
justice
harlan
except
for
the
very
general
proposition
that
the
police
may
make
some
temporary
stoppage
of
a
citizen
if
there
is
a
reason
to
inquire
his
suspicious
conduct.
the
only
thing
the
police
officers
saw
that
morales
do
was
to
get
out
of
a
taxi
cab.
that's
hardly
the
kind
of
conduct,
i
think,
that
terry
envisions.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
certainly
were.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
oh,
they
were
there
because
they
were
looking
for
melvin
morales.
but
it's
the
reason
why
they
were
looking
for
melvin
morales,
that
makes
the
seizure
here
unreasonable
within
the
ambit
of
the
fourth
amendment.
they
were
not
operating
on
anything
that
remotely
approaching
probable
cause
for
his
arrest.
they
had
nothing
but
a
bare
suspicion
that
he
might
have
something
to
tell
them
about
the
crime
since
of
course,
his
family
lived
in
the
building.
he
was
an
addict
and
he
had
not
been
seen
around.
this
hardly,
intellectively
points
the
finger
of
suspicion
at
morales.
the
court
of
appeals
have
to
checkerboard
square
of
investigation
pointed
only
to
morales
but
at
most,
to
give
the
people
their
due,
four
out
of
those
64
squares
on
any
checkerboard
were
filled
in
here.
that
hardly,
i
think
mounts
up
to
a
kind
of
justification
for
a
seizure
and
detention
of
a
citizen
as
into
this
case.
to
say
that,
since
morales
knew
the
police
was
looking
for
him
that
he
is
coming
to
his
mother's
beauty
parlor,
may
be
read
as
a
surrender
flies
in
the
face
of
both
the
determination
by
new
york
court
of
appeals,
that
there
was
nothing
in
this
record
to
support
a
consent
of
argument.
and
there's
also
tantamount
in
my
opinion
to
saying
that
a
lamb
that
goes
to
the
pasture
and
surrenders
himself
to
the
wolf.
morales
wanted
to
surrender
to
the
police.
there
are
better
places
to
surrender
to
the
police
than
your
mother's
beauty
parlor.
there
are
police
stations,
many
of
them.
but
morales,
i
don't
think
can
be
said
to
have
surrendered
in
this
case.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
has
decided
that
question
that
there
was
no
surrender,
no
consent
to
interrogation
at
that
place
under
the
circumstances.
and
since
that
is
a
determination,
i
believe
on
the
question
of
fact
by
the
highest
court
in
the
state
of
new
york.
i
do
not
think
that
that
question
of
fact
is
reviewable
by
this
court.
but
if
the
court
be
convinced
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
it
becomes
another
more
pressing
problem.
if
the
fourth
amendment
was
violated,
what
affect
does
should
that
have
on
the
use
of
morales'
confessions.
taking
my
lead
from
the
american
law
institutes
modal
code
of
pre-arraignment
procedures
especially
article
ix
of
that
document
and
from
wong
sun
versus
the
united
states.
i
believe
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
once
the
confessions
are
taken
so
close,
at
least
the
point
of
time,
to
an
unreasonable
seizure
within
the
fourth
amendment.
those
confessions
must
be
barred
from
evidence
without
reference
to
the
fact
of
the
voluntariness
or
no.
as
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again,
the
purpose
behind
the
exclusion
of
every
rule
is
to
discourage
the
police
from
engaging
into
prohibited
conduct.
prohibited
conduct
here
is
an
investigatory
detention
upon
less
than
probably
cause.
the
involuntary
submission
of
the
citizen
to
the
custody
in
the
police
station,
if
the
fourth
amendment
is
to
be
protected
in
this
conduct,
in
this
context,
the
confessions
obtained
at
the
police
station
just
by
john
davis,
his
fingerprints
in
davis
case
must
be
barred
from
evidence,
whether
they
were
voluntary
or
not.
the
next
step,
of
course,
is
that
the
court
not
be
willing
to
buy
a
rule
based
upon
per
se
exclusion.
we
then
come
to
the
question,
was
there
the
kind
of
attenuation
between
the
initial
police
illegality,
that
is
the
seizure
of
morales
on
the
street
corner
and
his
confessions
that
would
permit
the
court
to
say
that
there
has
been
a
dissipation
of
the
primary
obtained.
again,
the
leading
case
is
wong
sun
versus
the
united
states.
their
blocky
toy
was
confession
was
excluded
from
evidence,
were
seized
in
his
own
premises
made
admissions
almost
immediately.
wong
sun
took
off,
was
at
large
for
several
days,
then
came
back,
and
made
his
confessions,
as
to
wong
sun
came
to
the
primary
illegality
of
any
uncertain
and
unanticipated
with,
as
to
blocky
toy
as
to
melvin
morales
in
this
case.
the
link
between
the
illegal
police
activity
of
seizing
morales
without
probable
cause
and
taking
him
without
his
consent
into
the
custody
is
so
closely
linked
both
in
time
and
in
circumstances.
because
morales
was
taken
down
to
the
police
station
and
interrogated
almost
immediately,
the
mere
fact
of
interposition
of,
well,
i
think
the
properly
called
that
that's
point
in
time
escobedo
warnings,
should
not
by
and
off
themselves
be
a
sufficient
attenuation
of
attained.
the
oppressiveness
of
the
initial
seizure
was
followed
by
the
oppressiveness
of
the
detention
at
the
place
selected
by
the
police
which
was
followed
by
the
oppressiveness
of
the
isolation
from
everyone
else
in
the
world
but
the
police,
which
is
followed
in
short
order
by
the
confessions.
the
link
between
these
confessions
and
the
seizure
is
so
close
both
in
time
and
in
circumstances
that
i
believe
your
honors
that
it
cannot
be
reasonably
said
in
the
realistic
appraisal
of
this
record.
that
there
has
been
a
kind
of
attenuation
between
the
unlawful
police
conduct
in
the
first
place
violating
the
principles
unasked
by
this
court
less
than
seven
months
ago
in
davis
versus
mississippi
and
the
confessions
to
say
that
the
confessions
are
not
the
tainted
produce
of
this
initial
police
illegality.
and
further
your
honors,
we
submit
that
the
confessions
of
the
defendant,
each
and
every
one
of
them
were
not
proven
to
be
voluntary
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
he
did
confess,
he
was
one
but
he
was
a
narcotics
addict.
a
group
prone
to
beguiles
to
have
a
rather
shallow
perception
of
their
rights
and
responsibilities.
he
was
isolated
from
his
only,
only
ally
in
the
field,
his
mother,
who
testified
that
she
wanted
to
tell
him
that
he
shouldn't
speak
to
police
officers.
he
was
alone
in
the
police
station.
he
was
isolated.
he
did
after
the
effect
but
as
haley
versus
ohio,
i
think
indicates
is
also
remained
to
look
after
the
fact
for
the
--
for
whatever
light,
the
subsequent
events
may
throw
on
his
gun
before
him.
after
that
he
did
wind
up
in
the
emergency
ward
of
morrisania
hospital
being
treated
for
what's
looked
like,
narcotics
withdrawal
symptoms
and
when
he
have
been
completely
free
of
that
is
of
police
custody.
when
he
was
completely
alone
for
several
days
to
cogitate,
ruminate
over
the
possibilities
of
his
right
not
to
speak
to
a
police
officer.
when
police
officers
arrived
on
october
20th,
morales
told
them
and
says,
“go
away,
i
don't
want
to
talk
to
you.”
removed
in
time
and
space
when
he
inherently
submit
inherently
coercive
atmosphere
surrounding
with
the
police
station,
morales
found
the
resolve
that
would've
stood
him
in
good
state,
if
he
had
been
in
the
position
to
assert
that
result
at
the
time
it
was
initially
taken
into
custody.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
mr.
justice
harlan,
at
the
time
he
was
arrested,
he
was
partially
30
years
of
age.
he'd
been
a
narcotics
addict
since
he
was
17
years
old.
graduated
from
junior
high
school,
had
some
trade
school
experience.
he
had
a
yellow
sheet,
the
arrest
record
in
new
york
is
called,
of
course
the
yellow
sheet
of
some
sizeable
dimension.
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
is
no
obey
than
would
this
was,
may
have
familiar
with
the
criminal
processes
and
to
buttress
their
conclusion
of
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
city.
he
was
so
familiar
with
the
kind
of
processes
that
he
chose
not
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
it
was
unlawfully
arrested,
but
he
morales
that
i'm
speaking
of
morales
chose
to
rely
on
the
stronger
argument
that
is
fourth
amendment
rights
that
was
violated.
your
honors,
i
thought
of
that
argument
not
both
in
morales
the
experience
to
the
criminal.
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
30
years
of
age,
your
honor,
i
submit,
the
fact
that
he
had
a
rather
extensive
criminal
record.
this
make
him
an
expert
on
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
fourth
amendment,
the
fifth,
the
sixth,
the
fourteenth
and
also,
i
find
that
the
requirement
that
issues
be
raised
in
the
normal
cause
of
events
at
the
trial
court.
here,
however,
he
had
the
--
he
couldn't
afford
a
better
lawyer,
so
he
got
someone
who
made
really
an
error
but
raised
the
issue
that
this
court
must
now
decide.
can
this
confession
or
these
confessions
be
admitted
in
light
of
the
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
rights?
your
honors,
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
very
briefly,
i
like
to
return
the
court's
attention
to
two
items
of
testimony
that
appear
on
the
record.
in
spite
of
the
intricate
complex
of
facts
upon
which
the
police
officers
might
have
operated
to
seize
morales,
we
have
summarized
that
our
brief
on
pages
13
and
14
and
over
the
15th,
the
facts
upon
which
they
actually
did
operate.
they
actually
operated
on
a
soonest
of
evidence,
so
slim
that
one
police
officer
when
asked
whether
morales
is
a
suspect
or
not,
was
led
to
this
remark.
he
said,
why
is
--
it
was
asked,
was
morales
a
suspect?
and
after
they
have
been
given
a
lead
by
the
trial
judge,
the
officer
said,
i
concur
with
the
judge
everybody
is
a
suspect.
the
reach
of
the
police
officers
here
is
not
limited
to
melvin
morales,
but
these
petty
officials
to
borrow
i
was
wrong
as
from
james
otis
to
speak
in
1761.
the
police
officers
here,
these
petty
officials
have
it
in
their
power
to
determine,
who
is
the
suspect
and
we
know
now
from
the
police
officer,
who
is
the
suspect?
it
is
thee
and
me
your
honors.
and
the
second
point
to
which
i
would
like
to
address
the
court's
attention
was
that
the
attack
on
the
admissibility
of
morales'
confessions
is
not
an
attempt
to
find
the
way
around
otherwise,
overwhelming
proof
of
guilt.
absent
morales'
confessions,
there
is
nothing
to
tie
him
to
the
crime
committed
in
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
close
that,
it
is
clear
that
he
was
worrying
on
the
night
in
question
had
been
turned
on
a
cleaning
establishment
on
october
5th?
to
whom
that
the
claiming
stab
wounds
found
no
traces
of
blood
on
that
clothes
--
on
those
clothes
and
the
police
laboratory
in
examining
those
clothes
found
no
traces
of
blood.
if
your
honors
look
at
the
pictures
in
the
record
from
the
scene
of
the
crime,
there
is
blood
on
the
floor,
there
is
blood
on
the
wall,
there
is
blood
on
the
door.
morales'
clothes
showed
no
signs
of
blood
and
it
is
the
people's
own
testimony
that
points
to
these
clothes
as
the
clothes
being
worn
by
morales
on
the
night
this
crime
was
supposed
to
have
been
committed.
the
only
item
of
clothing
missing
were
his
shoes
but
his
trousers,
if
you
look
at
the
pictures
in
the
record,
your
honors,
how
his
trousers
could've
escaped
being
covered
with
blood
and
door
house.
31-stabwound
victim
or
alleged
victim
could
not
have
bled
on
him.
it
trenches
upon
almost
a
lack
of
proof
of
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
absent
these
confessions.
and
your
honors,
as
i
think
the
court
will
understand
our
position
is
that
the
confessions
on
the
produce
of
an
unlawful
seizure
and
must
therefore
be
barred
from
use
on
this
trial.
thank
you
your
honors.
