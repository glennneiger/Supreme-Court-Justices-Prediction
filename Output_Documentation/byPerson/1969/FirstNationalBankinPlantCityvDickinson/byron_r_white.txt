justice

--
that
where
amongst
the
questions
of
government
law
lose
that
part
of
this
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
your
own
liability
for
the
money
after
all
you
have
custody
of
it,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
one
way
of
satisfying
that
contingent
liability
to
insure
your
customer.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
the
florida
statute
forbids
the
bank,
oh!
never
mind,
go
ahead,
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
smith,
i
take
it
that
the
florida
statute
which
requires
that
a
banking
law
do
all
of
its
business
in
one
place
would
might
well
bar
things
that
aren't
--
that
no
one
would
call
branch
banking.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
bank
wanted
to
set
up
a
new
business
office
in
some
new
development,
put
an
agent
out
there
to
give
him
an
office
to
develop
some
customer.
i
suppose
banks
have
their
new
business
people
going
out,
calling
on
people
all
the
time,
don't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
--
you
can
do
it
as
an
(voice
overlap)
to
do
it
in
the
premises?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
--
they'd
have
to
do
it
on
the
banking
premises?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
generally,
you
would
think
that
the
--
if
possible,
the
florida
law
might
prevent
things
that
aren't
franchise.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
federal
--
and
that
a
national
bank
could
engage
in
those
practices
because
they
aren't
branching?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
the
argument
here,
i
suppose.
the
argument
here
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
argument
here
is
that
all
the
bank
--
plant
city
bank
argues
this
isn't
a
branch
and
therefore
it
can
do
it,
no
matter
what
federal
--
no
matter
what
florida
law
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
were
saying
--
justice
byron
r.
white
anything
that
the
--
anything
that
federal
law,
that
florida
law
would
call
a
branch
would
control
36?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
isn't
that
the
word
branch
isn't
in
the
florida
statute
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
to
that
--
because,
once
it
sets
its
--
does
one
of
those
three
things,
it
is
a
branch
for
purposes
of
federal
law,
you
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
neither
did
the
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
draw
any
distinction
in
your
own
line
between
the
armored
car
service
and
the
depository?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
purposes
of
section
36?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
have
to
call
--
can
you
really
call
an
armored
car
service
that's
moving
around
a
place
of
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
a
branch
office
or
a
branch
agency?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
a
branch?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
branch
or
place
of
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
president
of
the
bank
every
now
and
then
stops
by
a
customer's
place
and
picks
up
his
deposits;
that's
a
branch
place
of
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
(voice
overlap)
under
36,
you
don't
only
need
the
acceptance
of
deposits
but
you
need
to
have
those
accepted
at
a
place
of
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
also
you
think
[inaudible]
this
is
hypothetical
because
an
armored
car
service
is
here
as
well
as
the
depository.
justice
byron

about
that.
