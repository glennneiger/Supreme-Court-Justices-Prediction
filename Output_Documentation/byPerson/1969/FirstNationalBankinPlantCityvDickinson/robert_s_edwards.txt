mr.
robert
s.
edwards
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
begin
if
i
might
by
addressing
myself
just
generally
to
how
we
got
in
to
this
situation.
i
represent
the
first
national
bank
in
plant
city
who
filed
the
suit
for
declaratory
relief
in
the
federal
district
court,
in
the
northern
district
of
florida
where
mr.
dickinson
resides
in
tallahassee.
we
were
faced
with
the
situation
of
where
we
had
gone
to
this
comptroller
of
the
currency
who
is
our
supervisor
and
our
boss
as
it
were
and
had
cleared
with
him
and
had
--
having
analyzed
his
regulations
and
rulings
that
we
could
carry
on
this
transaction
that
we
do
now
carry
on.
we
had
prepared
and
began
to
render
this
service
when
we
received
a
letter
directed
to
us
by
the
assistant
deputy
banking
--
the
deputy
banking
commissioner
of
the
state
of
florida
simply
telling
us
to
cease
and
desist
that
their
activities
constituted
branch
banking
under
section
659.06
of
the
florida
law
and
indicated
that
if
we
did
not
elect
to
cease
and
desist
that
they
would
take
action
as
they
had
just
recently
filed
against
a
bank
in
panama
city
to
require
us
to
terminate
this
type
of
service
that
we
were
rendering.
it
was
much
later
in
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
after
a
favorable
decision
by
the
federal
district
court
and
the
appeal
was
well
on
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
whenever
the
state
court
was
first
involved
in
this
litigation
by
a
service
that
was
began
by
a
bank
in
tallahassee.
so,
that
the
state
litigation
arose
much
later
in
the
course
of
time
and
there
was
no
state
litigation
available
or
state
decisions
available
that
would
guide
anybody
at
the
time
that
the
district
court
made
its
decision
in
this
matter.
i
might
as
a
matter
of
passing
point
out
to
you
that
much
later
even
after
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
entered
its
decision,
there
was
a
case
in
--
the
greater
mine
and
financial
corporation
against
dickinson
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
wherein
the
supreme
court
florida
declined
to
determine
that
section
--
that
chapter
659
made
the
activities
of
a
broker
who
was
soliciting
and
accepting
deposits
for
transmittal
to
a
savings
and
a
loan
association
in
the
state
of
california
as
a
banking
activity.
the
supreme
court
at
that
instance
said
that
the
receipt
of
these
moneys
by
this
broker
to
transmit
to
tal
--
california
did
not
constitute
the
acceptance
of
a
deposit
which
would
violate
chapter
659
of
the
banking
law
and
in
essence
make
that
broker
a
banker.
so,
that
that
decision
by
the
supreme
court
is
available
to
us
from
the
state
of
florida.
there
were
no
other
decisions.
there
are
no
other
decisions.
the
circuit
court
which
is
the
court
of
original
jurisdiction
in
florida
elected
to
simply
wait
the
outcome
of
this
case
since
the
activities
had
been
began
on
the
base
--
based
on
the
district
court's
opinion
or
decision
that
it
was
lawful.
i
need
to
speak
to
also
to
the
fact
that
we
have
been
characterized
as
carrying
on
a
subterfuge
in
our
activities
in
plant
city.
and
i
need
to
say
to
you
that
plant
city
is
a
small
community
located
20
miles
from
tampa,
11
miles
from
lakeland.
we
are
a
very
small
community
between
two
larger
communities
and
we
are
a
large
developing
area.
we
serve
a
much
larger
community
than
18,000
people.
we
had
a
real
need
shown
to
us
by
several
of
our
customers.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
within
the
incorporated
limits,
our
chamber
of
commerce
claims
18,000
people.
we
hasten
it
always
--
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
there
are
--
there's
one
other
bank,
a
state
chartered
bank
that's
been
existing
since
1905.
it
is
the
hillsborough
bank
and
one
of
the
interveners
here.
we
also
have
two
other
interveners
which
is
the
people's
bank
of
lakeland
which
is
11
miles
away
in
the
city
of
lakeland
and
the
first
state
bank
of
ruskin
which
is
approximately
25
miles
south
of
us.
these
three
banks
or
three
state
banks
are
interveners
in
this
cause.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
they
are
on
the
side
of
the
state
banking
commissioner.
they
have
actively
carried
on
the
litigation
on
behalf
of
the
banking
commissioner
of
florida,
resisting
the
decision
of
the
federal
district
court
and
sustaining
or
promoting
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
hillsborough
bank
has
long
been
in
existence,
the
state
banking
in
the
city
of
plant
city.
we
were
--
became
a
charter
bank
in
1957
and
as
such
was
the
baby
bank,
the
one
that
needed
to
get
out
and
to
do
things
in
order
to
get
deposits
and
in
order
to
be
able
to
render
a
service
to
the
community
and
thereby
grow.
we
are
the
smaller
bank
of
the
two
banks
in
the
community.
we
found
ourselves
in
1966
and
19
--
actually
in
1965
with
the
situation
where
our
city
which
had
been
long
a
very
small
city
was
beginning
to
develop
and
the
first
shopping
center
was
coming
in.
it
was
located
approximately
a
mile
from
town.
we
elected
or
we
researched
under
the
federal
ruling
that
was
available
to
us,
this
idea
of
how
we
could
render
a
service
to
this
shopping
center
approximately
a
mile
from
town.
we
determined
that
the
locating
of
a
drop,
some
--
very
similar,
a
matter
of
fact
identical
to
the
night
depository
which
we
had
at
the
bank.
in
that
shopping
center,
would
render
a
very
great
service
to
this
area
because
we
have
all
these
mini-stores
that
were
confronted
with
the
problem
of
getting
after
closing
hours,
getting
from
that
place
to
our
banking
premises
hopefully
and
possibly
to
the
other
banking
premise
to
deposit
the
collections
of
the
day
carrying
with
them
all
of
the
attended
problems
that
goes
with
transporting
money
after
dark
and
so
forth.
when
we
were
able
to
determine
that
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
felt
that
if
we
complied
with
these
rulings
that
this
drop
would
not
go
to
and
become
within
the
ambit
of
the
definition
of
a
branch
bank.
we
begin
this
service
and
incidentally
this
service
is
now
being
rendered
by
several
other
banks
within
the
state
of
florida.
this
service
is
simply
a
place
for
people
to
bring
their
night
bags
and
drop
then
into
the
night
depository.
so
that
they
will
be
picked
up
by
our
armored
car
messenger
service
and
transmit
it
to
the
bank
either
that
evening
or
the
next
morning
thereby
eliminating
the
problem
that
is
very
difficult
for
them.
now,
we
also
elected
at
the
same
time
because
the
definite
--
or
because
there
were
--
our
comptroller's
regulations
indicated
that
it
could
be
done
to
assign
contracts
with
various
other
business
people
in
the
area
which
said
that
we
would
agree
to
transmit
their
funds
to
the
bank
for
deposit.
as
agent
with
the
clear
understanding
on
the
basis
of
the
contract
that
was
signed
that
their
deposits
would
become
deposits
when
they
reached
the
bank,
the
bank's
teller
and
thereby
we
felt
that
we
had
adequately
met
the
test
that
the
federal
definitions
set
up.
when
we
examined
section
36
(f),
it
was
very
clear
to
say
that
branch
banking
would
be
considered
and
we
would
become
under
the
florida
regulations
when
we
established
a
branch
place
of
business
or
another
business
office
at
which
we
elected
to
accept
deposits
or
pay
checks
or
lend
money.
and
we
were
very
careful
not
because
of
any
subterfuge,
but
simply
because
we
wanted
to
stay
within
the
rules
and
render
the
service
that
was
needed
to
have
an
understanding
with
our
people
that
this
is
what
we
are
doing.
and
i
would
submit
to
you
that
on
the
basis
of
that,
we
have
a
clear
understanding
with
these
people
and
that
we
cannot
go
beyond
that
and
that
we
will
not
go
beyond
that
and
that
this
is
a
very
definite
and
clear
place
where
you
can
draw
the
line.
and
that
this
is
what
congress
we
believe
intended
to
do.
that
we
--
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
please
do.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
yes
we
do.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
if
he
has
own
deposit
in
the
first
national
bank
$10,000.00
and
has
previously
signed
this
contractual
arrangement
with
us
whereby
we
have
agreed
to
charge
his
account.
then,
we
will
charge
his
account,
place
this
money
in
a
sealed
container
outlining
the
moneys
that
is
in
there
carry
it
to
the
person
who
has
requested
it,
obtain
a
receipt
from
him
where
he
by
he
acknowledges
that
we
have
charged
his
account
at
the
bank
and
deliver
those
moneys
to
him,
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
we
do
that
quite
frequently
for
people
in
our
--
to
come
to
our
drive-in
window
--
if
they
asked
for
a
pay
--
that
a
payroll
will
be
made
up,
yes
we
do
that
and
place
it
within
the
bag
and
it
can
be
picked
up
in
our
drive-in
window
at
the
bank.
now,
i
say
that
because
i
don't
believe
that
we've
been
asked
to
do
that
in
our
service.
we
have
not
been
called
on,
but
the
answer
is
that
is
probably
we
would
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
well,
there
is
no
rule
on
it.
the
practical
economics
of
the
situation
would
govern.
we
--
our
truck
does
go
out
as
far
as
20
miles
in
one
or
two
instances
and
some
other
instances
are
in
all
honesty
the
trucks
range
much
further
than
that.
it
--
there
is
no
rule
within
the
federal
system
that
says
that
we
can
go
only
so
far.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
under
the
present
circumstances
in
florida,
it
could
not
because
it
has
been
held
by
comptroller
dickinson
to
be
a
matter
of
branch
banking
and
they
would
not
allow
that.
i
think
that
would
bring
us
well
to
this
idea
of
the
competitive
equality
which
has
been
the
overriding
problem
in
the
situation
all
along.
and
i
would
like
to
call
to
this
court's
attention
--
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
yes
we
do,
some
very
small
villages
are
--
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
of
one
store
or
two
stores,
fill-in
stations
and
a
store
combined
to
something
in
its
stature.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
no
sir,
there
is
not.
however,
i
would
want
to
say
to
the
court
that
we
have
not
set
our
rules
that
would
prohibit
us
to
go
into
another
bank's
community.
we
simply
feel
that
we
could
legitimately
do
that
as
that
bank,
for
instance
the
people's
bank
in
lakeland
comes
in
to
our
community
constantly
in
advertising
and
lending
money
and
so
forth
so
that
we
are
constantly
competitive
with
those
other
banks
in
the
other
communities.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
we
have
a
night
depository
or
we
have
a
drop
at
the
shopping
center
that
is
the
same
thing
as
a
night
depository.
it
is
at
a
shopping
center
approximately
a
mile
from
our
main
banking
office.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
it's
the
only
one
that
we
have,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
our
truck
drives
to
their
door
and
our
messenger
carries
it
to
the
business
house
which
is
previously
contracted
with
us
for
this
service.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
we
--
that
is
correct
sir.
we
pick
up
sealed
bags
upon
which
there
is
listed
on
the
outside
on
a
transmittal
slip
the
moneys
that
is
contained
therein.
this
transmittal
slip
also
has
printed
on
the
back
side
the
contract
under
which
we
operate
specifying
that
its
being
transmitted
as
their
agent
and
that
it
will
become
a
deposit
when
it
has
reached
the
bank
then
received
by
a
teller
and
the
deposit
slip
completed,
main
deposit
slip
completed.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
under
the
contract,
the
funds
have
not
become
deposit
funds
in
the
first
national
bank.
however,
we
obtained
from
the
insurance
company
which
writes
our
bond
and
our
insurance
a
special
writer
whereby
they
agreed
that
they
were
insuring
those
funds
for
the
benefit
of
those
persons
who
have
placed
the
funds
in
that
night
depository.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
there
is
no
difference
in
that
--
in
deposit
to
get
out
there
and
the
night
depository
which
is
located
adjacent
to
our
bank,
but
we
would
--
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
it
is
a
part
of
the
banking
--
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
it
is
a
part
of
the
banking
business
as
it
were
for
terms
of
the
--
of
a
bank's
activities
and
perhaps
comes
within
the
ambit
of
the
florida
statute,
i
say
perhaps.
however,
if
we
go
back
to
the
proposition
that
we
must
look
first
to
section
36
(f)
of
the
federal
statute
to
determine
what
is
branch
banking
and
therefore
what
is
controlled
by
the
federal
law,
the
deposit
contract
becomes
a
very
key
situation.
in
other
words,
it
is
the
place
where
we
draw
the
line.
it
is
the
place
where
we
mark
the
outer
limit
as
this
court
said
in
the
agricultural
bank
concerning
the
right
to
tax.
it's
the
line
of
demarcation
which
we
believe
is
a
very
clear
mind
--
line.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
we
insure
it
because
it
is
a
service
to
our
customer
and
we
feel
that
the
customers
would
be
at
lost
without
it.
however,
we
are
very
careful
to
help
the
customer
understand
and
the
insurer
to
understand
that
there
is
a
contract
protecting
them.
and
for
that
reason
therefore
--
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
the
contract
that
they
have
with
us
is
a
definitive
contract
as
the
type
of
service
that
we're
rendering
them.
the
contract
protecting
them
is
the
insurance
contract
which
is
a
separate
contract,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
well,
we
have
a
possible
liability
except
for
the
fact
that
we
have
a
clear
contractual
understanding
that
the
money
is
there.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
that's
correct
sir
and
that's
what
we've
elected
to
do.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
no
sir,
under
the
contract
that
exist
they
would
not
be
and
we
of
course
would
look
to
the
insurance
company
for
their
reimbursement.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
yes
sir,
i
think
we
would
definitely
have
reached
--
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
well,
to
begin
with
we
have
no
people
there.
it
simply
a
hole
in
the
wall
where
you
can
go
and
leave
it
but
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
no
sir,
the
messengers
does
not
stay
there,
he
simply
calls
picks
up.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
yes
he
does,
very
definitely.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
he
does.
but
the
point
being
is
that
if
we
could
go
back
to
the
night
depository,
we
have
a
clear
understanding
by
contract
--
the
established
night
depository
law
that
when
you
drop
in
to
the
night
depository
at
the
bank,
you
have
not
made
a
deposit.
and
we
believe
that
this
definitive,
this
definition,
is
very
important
in
defining
this
--
the
state
versus
the
national
situation
and
that
it
is
a
breaking
point
that
it
is
the
proper
breaking
point.
if
we
did
set
up
this
building
that
you
talk
about
and
render
these
services,
we
are
clear
--
clearly
within
the
deposit
window
situation
that
is
anticipated
by
congress
and
we
believe
that
we
still
--
or
without
that
whenever
we
have
rendered
the
service
on
this
basis.
we
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
there's
a
very
definite
and
a
clear
reason
for
wanting
to
do
this
because
it
does
render
our
service
and
it
constitutes
a
banking
service
rather
than
branch
banking
which
is
prescribed
by
the
federal
and
state
law.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
well,
to
begin
with,
i
believe
that
when
we
start
dealing
with
deposit
law
or
contract
law
and
move
over
into
the
functional
definition
rather
than
the
strict
contract
law
which
now
exists
as
well
developed
throughout
the
united
states
and
it
is
now
in
our
brief
that
we
are
beginning
to
deal
with
a
lot
of
problems.
fdic
insurance
coverage
and
many
other
areas
so
that
if
the
court
would
choose
to
say,
“well,
functionally
anything
that
looks
like
at
depositor,
smells
like
a
deposit
is,”
i
think
you've
opened
the
door
to
liability
on
parts
of
banks
in
night
depository
situations,
in
fdic
situations
and
many
other
situations
that
would
be
a
very
big
problem
and
i
think
that
this
is
an
area
that
would
--
that
should
be
looked
out
there
closely
based
on
the
well-developed
contract
law
as
it
now
exists.
if
i
could
say
one
thing
concerning
this
competitive
equality.
competitive
equality
cannot
be
a
mirror
image
in
my
judgment
and
by
imposing
the
competitive
equality
that
the
circuit
court
has
elected
to
do,
the
result
of
the
situation
has
been
that
i
as
a
federal
--
as
a
first
--
a
national
bank
customer
must
go
and
ask
my
--
supervisors,
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
may
i
do
this
and
once
he
says,
“yes,
i
can
or
no,
then
i
must
go
ask
the
state
supervisor
also,
“may
i
do
this?”
in
your
judgment
is
a
branch
banking
does
--
and
if
he
says,
“no
i
can't,”
i
can't.
the
result
of
this
situation
is
that
i
am
placed
in
the
--
at
the
butt-end
of
the
most
restrictive
ruling
of
either
the
state
or
the
national
comptroller.
and
where
the
national
comptroller
says,
“no,
you
can't
do
it,”
the
state
bank
still
may
be
able
to
do
it
in
this
range
or
ambit
of
other
competitive
items
and
there
are
numerous
but
i
cannot
do
this
because
i
am
held
down
by
both
of
them.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
begin
if
i
might
by
addressing
myself
just
generally
to
how
we
got
in
to
this
situation.
i
represent
the
first
national
bank
in
plant
city
who
filed
the
suit
for
declaratory
relief
in
the
federal
district
court,
in
the
northern
district
of
florida
where
mr.
dickinson
resides
in
tallahassee.
we
were
faced
with
the
situation
of
where
we
had
gone
to
this
comptroller
of
the
currency
who
is
our
supervisor
and
our
boss
as
it
were
and
had
cleared
with
him
and
had
--
having
analyzed
his
regulations
and
rulings
that
we
could
carry
on
this
transaction
that
we
do
now
carry
on.
we
had
prepared
and
began
to
render
this
service
when
we
received
a
letter
directed
to
us
by
the
assistant
deputy
banking
--
the
deputy
banking
commissioner
of
the
state
of
florida
simply
telling
us
to
cease
and
desist
that
their
activities
constituted
branch
banking
under
section
659.06
of
the
florida
law
and
indicated
that
if
we
did
not
elect
to
cease
and
desist
that
they
would
take
action
as
they
had
just
recently
filed
against
a
bank
in
panama
city
to
require
us
to
terminate
this
type
of
service
that
we
were
rendering.
it
was
much
later
in
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
after
a
favorable
decision
by
the
federal
district
court
and
the
appeal
was
well
on
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
whenever
the
state
court
was
first
involved
in
this
litigation
by
a
service
that
was
began
by
a
bank
in
tallahassee.
so,
that
the
state
litigation
arose
much
later
in
the
course
of
time
and
there
was
no
state
litigation
available
or
state
decisions
available
that
would
guide
anybody
at
the
time
that
the
district
court
made
its
decision
in
this
matter.
i
might
as
a
matter
of
passing
point
out
to
you
that
much
later
even
after
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
entered
its
decision,
there
was
a
case
in
--
the
greater
mine
and
financial
corporation
against
dickinson
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
wherein
the
supreme
court
florida
declined
to
determine
that
section
--
that
chapter
659
made
the
activities
of
a
broker
who
was
soliciting
and
accepting
deposits
for
transmittal
to
a
savings
and
a
loan
association
in
the
state
of
california
as
a
banking
activity.
the
supreme
court
at
that
instance
said
that
the
receipt
of
these
moneys
by
this
broker
to
transmit
to
tal
--
california
did
not
constitute
the
acceptance
of
a
deposit
which
would
violate
chapter
659
of
the
banking
law
and
in
essence
make
that
broker
a
banker.
so,
that
that
decision
by
the
supreme
court
is
available
to
us
from
the
state
of
florida.
there
were
no
other
decisions.
there
are
no
other
decisions.
the
circuit
court
which
is
the
court
of
original
jurisdiction
in
florida
elected
to
simply
wait
the
outcome
of
this
case
since
the
activities
had
been
began
on
the
base
--
based
on
the
district
court's
opinion
or
decision
that
it
was
lawful.
i
need
to
speak
to
also
to
the
fact
that
we
have
been
characterized
as
carrying
on
a
subterfuge
in
our
activities
in
plant
city.
and
i
need
to
say
to
you
that
plant
city
is
a
small
community
located
20
miles
from
tampa,
11
miles
from
lakeland.
we
are
a
very
small
community
between
two
larger
communities
and
we
are
a
large
developing
area.
we
serve
a
much
larger
community
than
18,000
people.
we
had
a
real
need
shown
to
us
by
several
of
our
customers.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
within
the
incorporated
limits,
our
chamber
of
commerce
claims
18,000
people.
we
hasten
it
always
--
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
there
are
--
there's
one
other
bank,
a
state
chartered
bank
that's
been
existing
since
1905.
it
is
the
hillsborough
bank
and
one
of
the
interveners
here.
we
also
have
two
other
interveners
which
is
the
people's
bank
of
lakeland
which
is
11
miles
away
in
the
city
of
lakeland
and
the
first
state
bank
of
ruskin
which
is
approximately
25
miles
south
of
us.
these
three
banks
or
three
state
banks
are
interveners
in
this
cause.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
they
are
on
the
side
of
the
state
banking
commissioner.
they
have
actively
carried
on
the
litigation
on
behalf
of
the
banking
commissioner
of
florida,
resisting
the
decision
of
the
federal
district
court
and
sustaining
or
promoting
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
hillsborough
bank
has
long
been
in
existence,
the
state
banking
in
the
city
of
plant
city.
we
were
--
became
a
charter
bank
in
1957
and
as
such
was
the
baby
bank,
the
one
that
needed
to
get
out
and
to
do
things
in
order
to
get
deposits
and
in
order
to
be
able
to
render
a
service
to
the
community
and
thereby
grow.
we
are
the
smaller
bank
of
the
two
banks
in
the
community.
we
found
ourselves
in
1966
and
19
--
actually
in
1965
with
the
situation
where
our
city
which
had
been
long
a
very
small
city
was
beginning
to
develop
and
the
first
shopping
center
was
coming
in.
it
was
located
approximately
a
mile
from
town.
we
elected
or
we
researched
under
the
federal
ruling
that
was
available
to
us,
this
idea
of
how
we
could
render
a
service
to
this
shopping
center
approximately
a
mile
from
town.
we
determined
that
the
locating
of
a
drop,
some
--
very
similar,
a
matter
of
fact
identical
to
the
night
depository
which
we
had
at
the
bank.
in
that
shopping
center,
would
render
a
very
great
service
to
this
area
because
we
have
all
these
mini-stores
that
were
confronted
with
the
problem
of
getting
after
closing
hours,
getting
from
that
place
to
our
banking
premises
hopefully
and
possibly
to
the
other
banking
premise
to
deposit
the
collections
of
the
day
carrying
with
them
all
of
the
attended
problems
that
goes
with
transporting
money
after
dark
and
so
forth.
when
we
were
able
to
determine
that
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
felt
that
if
we
complied
with
these
rulings
that
this
drop
would
not
go
to
and
become
within
the
ambit
of
the
definition
of
a
branch
bank.
we
begin
this
service
and
incidentally
this
service
is
now
being
rendered
by
several
other
banks
within
the
state
of
florida.
this
service
is
simply
a
place
for
people
to
bring
their
night
bags
and
drop
then
into
the
night
depository.
so
that
they
will
be
picked
up
by
our
armored
car
messenger
service
and
transmit
it
to
the
bank
either
that
evening
or
the
next
morning
thereby
eliminating
the
problem
that
is
very
difficult
for
them.
now,
we
also
elected
at
the
same
time
because
the
definite
--
or
because
there
were
--
our
comptroller's
regulations
indicated
that
it
could
be
done
to
assign
contracts
with
various
other
business
people
in
the
area
which
said
that
we
would
agree
to
transmit
their
funds
to
the
bank
for
deposit.
as
agent
with
the
clear
understanding
on
the
basis
of
the
contract
that
was
signed
that
their
deposits
would
become
deposits
when
they
reached
the
bank,
the
bank's
teller
and
thereby
we
felt
that
we
had
adequately
met
the
test
that
the
federal
definitions
set
up.
when
we
examined
section
36
(f),
it
was
very
clear
to
say
that
branch
banking
would
be
considered
and
we
would
become
under
the
florida
regulations
when
we
established
a
branch
place
of
business
or
another
business
office
at
which
we
elected
to
accept
deposits
or
pay
checks
or
lend
money.
and
we
were
very
careful
not
because
of
any
subterfuge,
but
simply
because
we
wanted
to
stay
within
the
rules
and
render
the
service
that
was
needed
to
have
an
understanding
with
our
people
that
this
is
what
we
are
doing.
and
i
would
submit
to
you
that
on
the
basis
of
that,
we
have
a
clear
understanding
with
these
people
and
that
we
cannot
go
beyond
that
and
that
we
will
not
go
beyond
that
and
that
this
is
a
very
definite
and
clear
place
where
you
can
draw
the
line.
and
that
this
is
what
congress
we
believe
intended
to
do.
that
we
--
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
please
do.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
yes
we
do.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
if
he
has
own
deposit
in
the
first
national
bank
$10,000.00
and
has
previously
signed
this
contractual
arrangement
with
us
whereby
we
have
agreed
to
charge
his
account.
then,
we
will
charge
his
account,
place
this
money
in
a
sealed
container
outlining
the
moneys
that
is
in
there
carry
it
to
the
person
who
has
requested
it,
obtain
a
receipt
from
him
where
he
by
he
acknowledges
that
we
have
charged
his
account
at
the
bank
and
deliver
those
moneys
to
him,
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
we
do
that
quite
frequently
for
people
in
our
--
to
come
to
our
drive-in
window
--
if
they
asked
for
a
pay
--
that
a
payroll
will
be
made
up,
yes
we
do
that
and
place
it
within
the
bag
and
it
can
be
picked
up
in
our
drive-in
window
at
the
bank.
now,
i
say
that
because
i
don't
believe
that
we've
been
asked
to
do
that
in
our
service.
we
have
not
been
called
on,
but
the
answer
is
that
is
probably
we
would
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
well,
there
is
no
rule
on
it.
the
practical
economics
of
the
situation
would
govern.
we
--
our
truck
does
go
out
as
far
as
20
miles
in
one
or
two
instances
and
some
other
instances
are
in
all
honesty
the
trucks
range
much
further
than
that.
it
--
there
is
no
rule
within
the
federal
system
that
says
that
we
can
go
only
so
far.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
under
the
present
circumstances
in
florida,
it
could
not
because
it
has
been
held
by
comptroller
dickinson
to
be
a
matter
of
branch
banking
and
they
would
not
allow
that.
i
think
that
would
bring
us
well
to
this
idea
of
the
competitive
equality
which
has
been
the
overriding
problem
in
the
situation
all
along.
and
i
would
like
to
call
to
this
court's
attention
--
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
yes
we
do,
some
very
small
villages
are
--
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
of
one
store
or
two
stores,
fill-in
stations
and
a
store
combined
to
something
in
its
stature.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
no
sir,
there
is
not.
however,
i
would
want
to
say
to
the
court
that
we
have
not
set
our
rules
that
would
prohibit
us
to
go
into
another
bank's
community.
we
simply
feel
that
we
could
legitimately
do
that
as
that
bank,
for
instance
the
people's
bank
in
lakeland
comes
in
to
our
community
constantly
in
advertising
and
lending
money
and
so
forth
so
that
we
are
constantly
competitive
with
those
other
banks
in
the
other
communities.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
we
have
a
night
depository
or
we
have
a
drop
at
the
shopping
center
that
is
the
same
thing
as
a
night
depository.
it
is
at
a
shopping
center
approximately
a
mile
from
our
main
banking
office.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
it's
the
only
one
that
we
have,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
our
truck
drives
to
their
door
and
our
messenger
carries
it
to
the
business
house
which
is
previously
contracted
with
us
for
this
service.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
we
--
that
is
correct
sir.
we
pick
up
sealed
bags
upon
which
there
is
listed
on
the
outside
on
a
transmittal
slip
the
moneys
that
is
contained
therein.
this
transmittal
slip
also
has
printed
on
the
back
side
the
contract
under
which
we
operate
specifying
that
its
being
transmitted
as
their
agent
and
that
it
will
become
a
deposit
when
it
has
reached
the
bank
then
received
by
a
teller
and
the
deposit
slip
completed,
main
deposit
slip
completed.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
under
the
contract,
the
funds
have
not
become
deposit
funds
in
the
first
national
bank.
however,
we
obtained
from
the
insurance
company
which
writes
our
bond
and
our
insurance
a
special
writer
whereby
they
agreed
that
they
were
insuring
those
funds
for
the
benefit
of
those
persons
who
have
placed
the
funds
in
that
night
depository.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
there
is
no
difference
in
that
--
in
deposit
to
get
out
there
and
the
night
depository
which
is
located
adjacent
to
our
bank,
but
we
would
--
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
it
is
a
part
of
the
banking
--
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
it
is
a
part
of
the
banking
business
as
it
were
for
terms
of
the
--
of
a
bank's
activities
and
perhaps
comes
within
the
ambit
of
the
florida
statute,
i
say
perhaps.
however,
if
we
go
back
to
the
proposition
that
we
must
look
first
to
section
36
(f)
of
the
federal
statute
to
determine
what
is
branch
banking
and
therefore
what
is
controlled
by
the
federal
law,
the
deposit
contract
becomes
a
very
key
situation.
in
other
words,
it
is
the
place
where
we
draw
the
line.
it
is
the
place
where
we
mark
the
outer
limit
as
this
court
said
in
the
agricultural
bank
concerning
the
right
to
tax.
it's
the
line
of
demarcation
which
we
believe
is
a
very
clear
mind
--
line.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
we
insure
it
because
it
is
a
service
to
our
customer
and
we
feel
that
the
customers
would
be
at
lost
without
it.
however,
we
are
very
careful
to
help
the
customer
understand
and
the
insurer
to
understand
that
there
is
a
contract
protecting
them.
and
for
that
reason
therefore
--
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
the
contract
that
they
have
with
us
is
a
definitive
contract
as
the
type
of
service
that
we're
rendering
them.
the
contract
protecting
them
is
the
insurance
contract
which
is
a
separate
contract,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
well,
we
have
a
possible
liability
except
for
the
fact
that
we
have
a
clear
contractual
understanding
that
the
money
is
there.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
that's
correct
sir
and
that's
what
we've
elected
to
do.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
no
sir,
under
the
contract
that
exist
they
would
not
be
and
we
of
course
would
look
to
the
insurance
company
for
their
reimbursement.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
yes
sir,
i
think
we
would
definitely
have
reached
--
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
well,
to
begin
with
we
have
no
people
there.
it
simply
a
hole
in
the
wall
where
you
can
go
and
leave
it
but
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
no
sir,
the
messengers
does
not
stay
there,
he
simply
calls
picks
up.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
yes
he
does,
very
definitely.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
he
does.
but
the
point
being
is
that
if
we
could
go
back
to
the
night
depository,
we
have
a
clear
understanding
by
contract
--
the
established
night
depository
law
that
when
you
drop
in
to
the
night
depository
at
the
bank,
you
have
not
made
a
deposit.
and
we
believe
that
this
definitive,
this
definition,
is
very
important
in
defining
this
--
the
state
versus
the
national
situation
and
that
it
is
a
breaking
point
that
it
is
the
proper
breaking
point.
if
we
did
set
up
this
building
that
you
talk
about
and
render
these
services,
we
are
clear
--
clearly
within
the
deposit
window
situation
that
is
anticipated
by
congress
and
we
believe
that
we
still
--
or
without
that
whenever
we
have
rendered
the
service
on
this
basis.
we
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
there's
a
very
definite
and
a
clear
reason
for
wanting
to
do
this
because
it
does
render
our
service
and
it
constitutes
a
banking
service
rather
than
branch
banking
which
is
prescribed
by
the
federal
and
state
law.
mr.
robert
s.
edwards
well,
to
begin
with,
i
believe
that
when
we
start
dealing
with
deposit
law
or
contract
law
and
move
over
into
the
functional
definition
rather
than
the
strict
contract
law
which
now
exists
as
well
developed
throughout
the
united
states
and
it
is
now
in
our
brief
that
we
are
beginning
to
deal
with
a
lot
of
problems.
fdic
insurance
coverage
and
many
other
areas
so
that
if
the
court
would
choose
to
say,
“well,
functionally
anything
that
looks
like
at
depositor,
smells
like
a
deposit
is,”
i
think
you've
opened
the
door
to
liability
on
parts
of
banks
in
night
depository
situations,
in
fdic
situations
and
many
other
situations
that
would
be
a
very
big
problem
and
i
think
that
this
is
an
area
that
would
--
that
should
be
looked
out
there
closely
based
on
the
well-developed
contract
law
as
it
now
exists.
if
i
could
say
one
thing
concerning
this
competitive
equality.
competitive
equality
cannot
be
a
mirror
image
in
my
judgment
and
by
imposing
the
competitive
equality
that
the
circuit
court
has
elected
to
do,
the
result
of
the
situation
has
been
that
i
as
a
federal
--
as
a
first
--
a
national
bank
customer
must
go
and
ask
my
--
supervisors,
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
may
i
do
this
and
once
he
says,
“yes,
i
can
or
no,
then
i
must
go
ask
the
state
supervisor
also,
“may
i
do
this?”
in
your
judgment
is
a
branch
banking
does
--
and
if
he
says,
“no
i
can't,”
i
can't.
the
result
of
this
situation
is
that
i
am
placed
in
the
--
at
the
butt-end
of
the
most
restrictive
ruling
of
either
the
state
or
the
national
comptroller.
and
where
the
national
comptroller
says,
“no,
you
can't
do
it,”
the
state
bank
still
may
be
able
to
do
it
in
this
range
or
ambit
of
other
competitive
items
and
there
are
numerous
but
i
cannot
do
this
because
i
am
held
down
by
both
of
them.
