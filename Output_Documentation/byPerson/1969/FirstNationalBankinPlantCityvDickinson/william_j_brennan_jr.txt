justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
see
mr.
springer,
the
florida
court
would
say
that
this
is
not
prohibited
by
a
part
of
a
statute
then
the
issue
we
have
here
wouldn't
be
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
instead
of
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
wait,
what
was
the
source
of
that
florida
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
there
are
no
florida
decisions
would
support
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation
you
say?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
what
--
is
that
issue
now
before
the
florida
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
springer,
do
you
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
and
citing
that
the
--
whether
this
is
a
branch
under
federal
law
and
wholly
irrelevant
to
consideration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
respect
to
whether
looking
at
it
simply
because
the
court
findings
of
the
federal
law,
it's
a
branch
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
never
mind.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
because
in
your
view,
that's
a
place
at
which
deposits
are
received,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
using
the
illustration
that
you
suggested
yourself
of
a
travel
agent,
if
out
this
shopping
center,
this
national
bank
maintains
not
to
strap
but
they
--
travel
agency
service
at
that
place.
it
might
be
that
hillsborough
would
be
prohibited
from
doing
that
by
florida
law,
but
i
gather
under
your
view
of
the
branching
provision,
36
(f)
and
that
would
be
inapplicable
to
the
maintenance
of
a
travel
agency,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
there
--
so
to
that
extent,
there
could
be
an
inequality
of
competition.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
smith.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
position
doesn't
depend
upon
with
succeeding
with
that
argument,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
if
these
are
perfectly
[inaudible]
by
the
constitution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
set
up
all
of
these
relationships
just
as
a
--
i
gather,
you
would
still
argue
that
this
is
a
service
which
is
a
branching
service,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
that,
i
just
want
to
be
clear,
you
don't
think
it's
so
important
that
your
case
stands
or
falls
on
your
succeeding
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
together
or
does
each
separately
a
branch
place
of
business?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
only
the
armored
car
service
without
the
supermarket
or
a
shopping
center
depository.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
(voice
overlap)
your
position
is
if
we
had
built
depository
at
the
location
of
the
shopping
center.
if
there
were
none
there,
he
would
still
say
that
there
was
a
branch
place
of
business
in
the
armored
car
service
alone.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
(voice

we're
stopping
at
these
various
chain
stores,
establishments
rather
than
going
to
depository
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
see
mr.

the
florida
