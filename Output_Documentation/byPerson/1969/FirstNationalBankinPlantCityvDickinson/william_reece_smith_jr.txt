mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
finally
deliver
what
prepared
remarks
i
have,
i'd
like
to
speak
to
some
of
the
questions
which
arose
from
the
bench.
i
don't
want
mr.
edwards
to
appear
to
be
the
only
expert
on
plant
city
florida
here
and
as
much
as
that's
where
i
was
reared.
and
the
other
bank,
the
state
bank,
the
hillsborough
bank
is
the
bank
in
which
my
family
is
interested,
so
we
have
a
little
local
situation
here.
mr.
springer
talked
about
the
messenger
riding
the
truck.
somehow,
it's
been
overlooked
that
there's
also
a
trained,
paid
teller
on
this
truck,
trained
by
the
bank
to
do
all
of
the
functions
that
a
teller
does
in
a
bank.
both
of
these
gentlemen
have
referred
to
the
depository
as
a
hole
in
the
wall
in
the
shopping
center.
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
page
387
of
the
appendix
in
this
cause
to
take
a
look
at
the
hole
in
the
wall.
what
happened
here
was
is
that
plant
city
got
its
first
large
shopping
center
in
its
history
and
first
national
went
out
to
that
shopping
center
and
rented
a
store
and
then
set
up
its
depository
in
the
store
within
the
interior
mall
next
to
the
new
chain
stores
which
were
moving
into
the
community.
and
when
the
shopping
center
opened,
what
happened?
first
national
got
every
new
account,
every
large
new
account
out
of
that
shopping
center
because
it
got
the
advantage
of
location
which
is
so
important
in
banking.
the
hillsborough
bank,
the
older
bank,
the
larger
bank,
the
one
that
one
might
assume
would
get
a
little
business
out
of
it
got
absolutely
not
a
new
customer.
the
picture
shows
that
there's
a
good
deal
and
more
there
than
a
hole
in
the
wall
and
that
is
my
point.
secondly,
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
it
does,
sir.
we
so
interpret
it.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
well,
there
are
two
arguments,
mr.
justice
black.
i
think,
first
is,
what
is
the
test
to
determine
branching
under
12
u.s.c.--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
practically
speaking,
what
is
it
the
core
of
it
is
that
the
national
bank
through
the
ruling
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
which
completely
reverses
the
rulings
that
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
had
been
making
for
over
40
years
as
to
armored
cars
and
as
to
depositories
has
gained
a
competitive
advantage
over
the
state
banks
in
the
state
of
florida
in
the
performance
of
basic
essentials
of
banking.
to
use
a
not
very
polite
term,
the
guts
of
banking,
may
it
please
the
court,
are
the
getting
hold
of
money,
getting
deposits.
the
cash
--
paying
of
checks
and
the
making
of
loans
and
congress
said
under
36
(f)
that
anyone
of
those
things
which
should
be
defined
as
a
branch
for
purposes
of
36
(f)
and
ultimately
for
purposes
of
reference
to
state
law.
anyone
of
them
and
certainly
one
is
clearly
involved
here
which
is
receiving
deposits
and
i'm
talking
about
the
functional
act
of
receiving
deposits,
the
getting
the
advantage
of
getting
the
money
which
is
precisely
what
first
national
is
doing.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
that's
right.
except
the
--
in
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
oh!
yes
sir,
it
can.
but
that's
a
matter
of
policy
that
congress
left
for
local
determination
saying
that
a
state
would
have
to
decide
whether
branching
in
this
area
should
or
should
not
be
allowed.
[inaudible]
state
bank
can't
dictate
state
policy
on
those
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
is
true.
they
could
do
that.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
a
satis
--
its
certainly
not
a
satisfactory
way
to
combat
the
armored
car
operations
because
it
does
a
good
deal
more,
may
it
please
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
i
do
indeed
sir.
under
section
36
(f),
i
do
indeed.
it
is
an
--
that
36
(f)
says,
any
place
is
the
branch
bank
which
is
an
agency,
an
office
or
a
place
of
business
where
either
deposits
are
received,
checks
are
paid
or
money
is
lent
and
that's
precisely
what's
involved
here.
we've
certainly
--
the
armored
car
is
either
an
agency
or
an
office
or
a
place
of
business.
so
too
is
the
depository.
we
have
lots
of
laundromats
in
that
part
of
the
world
but
you
don't
have
any
people
out
there
but
they
are
certainly
places
of
business
and
this
depository
in
the
shopping
center
is
clearly
a
place
of
business
where
first
national
bank
gets
a
competitive
advantage
in
the
control
of
an
essential
of
banking,
that
is
receiving
deposits
and
their
only,
only
way
they
seek
to
avoid
the
argument
which
i
make
and
the
way
that
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
said
is
the
way
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
said
they
could.
the
comptroller
as
i
have
said,
reversed
himself.
they're
over
20
inconsistent
rulings
since
1929
with
the
ruling
the
comptroller
made
when
he
authorized
this.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
had
disapproved
and
discouraged
armored
car
operations
and
depository
operations
of
this
sort
on
the
ground
that
they
were
branch
banking
under
36
(f).
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir.
we
subpoenaed
the
complete
precedence
file
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
we
tried
to
take
his
deposition,
they
wouldn't
let
us
do
that,
but
we
got
the
complete
precedence
file
and
it
is
in
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
the
comptroller
is
saying
that
they
were
not
authorized
in
states
which
were
non-branching
states
because
they
would
violate
the
provisions
of
36
(f)
and
(c).
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
i
don't
know
what
mr.
springer's
argument
is,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
may
be
precisely
what
ours
is.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
we--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
respondents
take
this
position,
mr.
justice
harlan.
we
say
that
there
are
about
four
different
views
which
have
been
advanced
to
you.
the
first
is
that
36
(f)
is
to
be
narrowly
construed
without
any
reference
whatsoever
to
the
competitive
equality
upon
which
the
section
clearly
was
based
in
its
enactment.
we
say
that's
wrong.
we
made
this
argument
before
the
district
court.
it
took
that
view
but
we
say,
even,
even
in
that
event,
if
that
is
the
correct
view,
then
we
still
should
have
prevailed
because
the
contractual
arrangement
or
fictitious
the
court
should
look
the
form
to
substance,
there
is
no
real
agency
relationship
and
accordingly
even
by
a
common
law
principle,
agent
to
the
bank
are
authorized
to
receive
deposits
and
are
therefore
receiving
deposits
off-premises.
that's
the
first
argument.
the
second
argument
is,
we
made
an
argument
that
36
(f)
was
exclusively
def
--
exclusively
federal.
it
was
a
complete
definition
without
any
reference
to
state
law,
but
it
should
be
construed
broadly
and
liberally
for
the
purpose
of
effectuating
competitive
equality.
and
this
view
incidentally
is
one
of
the
position
which
is
taken
in
a
little
pamphlet
by
the
legislative
reference
section
of
the
library
of
congress
in
evaluating
certain
of
mr.
saxon's
rulings
and
it
suggests
a
broad
construction.
we
argued
that
construction
before
the
district
court
until
we
found
judge
lindberg's
unpublished
opinion
in
state
chartered
banks
then
we
had
an
authority
better
than
a
pamphlet
from
library
of
congress.
and
so
we
began
to
rely
without
moving
away
from
the
other
argument,
but
arguing
in
the
alternative,
we
began
to
rely
on
judge
lindberg's
state
chartered
bank's
decision
which
is
that
36
(f)
is
a
partial
definition
where
function
is
the
important
thing.
function
and
physicality
that
is
presents
a
prima
facie
test
of
banking,
of
branch
banking
under
the
federal
definition
and
if
the
operation
meets
that
prima
facie
test,
then
the
threshold
is
crossed
and
you
look
to
state
law.
now,
we
support
that
view
before
this
court
and
recommend
it
to
this
court
as
being
the
best
view.
it
provides
guidelines.
it's
flexible.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
sir?
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
judge
lindberg
faced
with
a
similar
problem
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
he
is
a
district
judge
in
washington
sir
and
he
was
the
one
who
--
one
of
the
ones
who
grappled
with
this
thing
in
greatest
depth
first.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
he
took
the
position
that
36
(f)
provided
a
partial
functional
definition
of
branch
banking
and
that
if
a
given
activity
met
that
functional
definition
then
the
threshold
was
crossed
and
one
should
look
to
state
law.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
think,
i
would
have
to
admit
that
but
i
would
also
point
out
that
in
1927
in
the
mc
--
at
the
time
that
mcfadden
act
was
being
debated,
that
there
were
many
people
who
argued
that
branch
banking
was
a
progressive
service.
that
it
offered
service
and
convenience
to
the
customer
and
congress
decided
in
phrasing
the
mcfadden
act
as
it
did
and
taking
the
approach
that
it
did,
that
the
question
of
service
and
convenience
in
this
area
should
be
left
for
local
determination.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
in
terms
of
the
operation
in
hand,
i
would
say,
it
was
national
sir.
i
think
it's
that
the
operations
of
this
sort
are
being
considered
and
battled
all
over
the
country.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
is,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
just
--
i
think
it's
a
different
method
of
operation
in
addition
to
sending
them
in
by
mail.
the
advertisement
of
this
bank,
advertisers
that
they
have
banking
by
mail
and
say
they
also
furnish
this
service.
to
be
perfectly
candid
sir,
i
see
no
justification
for
this
operation
whatsoever
in
the
way
that
first
national
set
it
up
except
to
gain
a
competitive
advantage.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i
understand
that.
and
my
response
to
the
need
of
your
village
sir
was
that
--
is
that
in
the
context
of
this
lawsuit,
if
the
service
was
needed
and
the
state
of
alabama
decided
that
it
should
allow
the
activity
then
that's
properly
the
case
but
it
was
for
alabama
to
decide
that
and
not
for
the
federal
government
when
one
is
dealing
with
the
three
essential
functions
here.
i
say
not
with
the
federal
government,
i
don't
really
mean
to
say
that
because
congress
can
change
the
definition
of
36
(c)
and
36
(f)
if
it
wants
to.
congress
can
take
an
entirely
different
approach,
but
i
respectfully
submit
that
it
is
solely
for
congress
to
do
it
and
it
is
not
for
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
by
rulings,
it's
not
for
the
first
national
bank
of
plant
city
and
indeed
with
respect,
it's
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir.
that
is
precisely
my
point.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
no
sir,
i
don't.
i
don't
know
that
much
about
banking.
mr.
bell
who'll
speak
in
a
few
minutes
and
he
is
much
better
informed
in
that
area
than
i
am.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
not
in
the
appendix,
no
sir.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
it
is
in
the
original
record,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
no
sir,
he
would
not,
so
long
as
he
was
a
common
carrier
for
hire
and
had
certificate
from
our
public
utilities
commission.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
for
the
purpose
of
going
out
to
say
a
large
commercial
customer
who
wanted
its
moneys
taken
into
the
bank
but
there's
a
great
distinction,
may
it
please
the
court,
between
the
brinks
for
example,
offering
that
service
and
the
first
national
bank
in
plant
city
either
offering
it
through
its
own
armored
car
are
alternatively
through
first
national
hiring
and
controlling
brinks.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
sir.
i
think
the
public
utilities
commission
of
florida
is
going
to
have
a
little
of
this
before
its
over
because
when
the
bank
begins
to
receive
money
for
the
service,
it
is
in
my
judgment
at
least
going
to
be
involved
in
operating
common
carrier
for
hiring,
we're
going
to
have
a
new
battle
over
that
setting.
that's
the
reason,
they're
not
charging
at
the
present
time.
they're
afraid
to.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
think
that
is
possible,
it
could
do
that.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
well,
i
think
we
have
to
be
careful
with
our
example,
mr.
justice
white
but
to
take
an
easy
one;
the
bank
can
operate
a
travel
agency,
a
state
bank
can
operate
a
travel
agency
in
florida
as
part
of
the
business
of
banking
and
i
certainly
wouldn't
get
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
sir?
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
so
far
as
i
know,
it
does
it
on
the
premises,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
i
think
that
is
possible,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
that
the
argument
here
is
the
reverse
of
that,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
well,
we
go
back
to
the
test,
how
do
we
get
there?
in
the
first
place,
is
this
an
activity
which
falls
within
36
(f)
from
a
functional
point
of
view.
does
it
involve
the
basic
essentials
of
banking?
we
say
that
it
does.
therefore,
the
reference
must
the
state
law.
at
that
level,
national
and
state
banks
will
be
treated
exactly
the
same
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
--
by
florida
law.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
no
sir,
i
don't
make
that
argument.
i
make
the
argument
that
first,
federal
law
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
that
is
true
sir.
i
make
the
argument
that
when
one
is
dealing
with
the
essentials
of
banking
as
is
the
case
here,
that
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
activity
is
a
branch,
you
first
must
apply
36
(f).
in
the
event
that
the
activity
is
one
of
those
three
things
then
the
reference
is
the
state
law.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
it
is
a
branch
for
purposes
of
36
(f),
yes
sir.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
think
that
result
can
be
reached
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
that
is
true
and
congress
was
not
concerned
with
and
did
not
try
in
the
mcfadden
act
in
this
branching
area
to
give
complete
equality.
we
don't
contend
that
complete
equality
is
required.
we
contend
that
a
competitive
equality
is
required
as
to
the
basic
functions
of
banking
and
that
no
contract,
no
notice
can
change
the
fact
that
what
first
national
doing
here
is
getting
control
of
money
off-premises.
the
contracts
don't
mean
a
hill
of
banes
to
the
local
expression,
excuse
me.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
i'm
sorry
sir.
i
can't
hear
you.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
they
never
put
two
aboard
sir
but
that
is
an
interesting
fact.
it
is
--
the
presentation
has
been
made
here
that
they
--
they
only
were
--
or
doing
a
rather
limited
thing
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
this
litigation
broke
out
almost
contemporaneously
with
the
commencement
of
these
two
operations.
and
the
early
advertising
within
days
before
the
litigation
commenced,
as
mr.
justice
black
notes
on
page
389
the
record
says,
richard
was
the
bank's
president,
described
the
car
as
a
mobile
drive-in,
staffed
by
an
armed
guard
and
two
tellers.
it
has
a
large
window
where
customers
may
be
served
and
a
communication
system.
now,
they
contend
that
they
haven't
served
any
customers
from
this
counter,
this
complete
teller's
window
which
is
on
the
side
of
it.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
that
it's
just
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
there's
none
sir.
and
at
that
place
that
to
which
you
refer,
they
are
receiving
deposits
and
therefore,
if
they
do
it
to
the
armored
car,
they
are
likewise
receiving
deposits.
there
is
one
point
that
i
would
like
to
refer
to
before
it
slips
my
mind.
the
presentation
is
--
has
been
made
here
that
all
that
is
--
has
happened
in
this
operation
is
that
money
has
been
delivered
to
customers
and
picked
up
and
brought
back.
this
is
done
routinely,
six
days
a
week
by
the
armored
car.
the
armored
car
calls
upon
the
depository,
twice
everyday.
at
the
depository,
it
is
not
only
night
bags
that
are
placed
into
the
depository,
but
also
envelopes
containing
the
transmittal
slip
which
is
really
just
a
regular
deposit
slip
with
the
conjured
language
on
the
back
of
it
in
trying
to
make
an
agency
out
of
it
and
this
is
the
most
important
point
because
it
should
resolve
this
case
below
and
we
should
have
never
been
here.
the
district
court
held
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
first
national
was
paying
checks
through
this
operation
because
it
would
actually
deliver
the
cash
to
a
customer,
say
it,
over
a
cash
store
and
take
a
check
in
return
drawn
on
the
bank
that
is
paying
checks,
that's
a
section
36
function.
but
the
district
court
strangely
enough
said,
it
isn't
going
to
approve
that,
but
it
will
approve
the
rest
of
the
operation
because
the
first
national
is
otherwise
substantially
complied
with
the
comptroller
of
the
currency's
ruling.
and
we've
never
been
on
this
--
we've
constantly
argued
that
this
was
wrong,
we
made
this
point
to
the
fifth
circuit
but
the
fifth
circuit
didn't
reach
it.
we
do
not
see
how
if
in
the
course
of
the
operation
of
the
armored
car.
there
was
a
paying
of
check
operation
that
that
can
be
ignored
for
the
purposes
of
definition
of
36
(f).
the
argument
is
made
that
the
question
is
moot
because
first
national
promised
to
stop
it,
but
number
one,
the
record
doesn't
show
that
they
stopped
it;
number
two,
they're
not
restrained
by
the
district
court
from
doing
it;
number
three,
we
are
restrained
from
interfering
with
them,
so
we
can't
find
out
what's
going
on;
and
number
four,
the
promise
to
stop
a
wrong
--
sir?
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
with
these
operations.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
by
the
district
court's
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
sir?
which
decided
(voice
overlap)?
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
no,
we
were
the
defendant.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
there
is
actually,
the
order
wasn't
entered
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
--
because
the
parties
agreed
to
abide
by
the
court's
decision
but
it's
the
same
thing.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
from
interfering
with
these
operations
in
any
way.
see,
i
now
--
i'm
speaking
here
not
only
for
the
intervener
state
banks
whom
i
represented
in
the
first
instance
but
i
speak
here
also
for
the
state
comptroller
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
--
of
the
state
of
florida
and
the
court
entered
an
order
that
the
comptroller
at
the
state
of
florida
should
no
longer
interfere
with
these
operations
by
first
national
bank.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
no
sir,
i'm
trying
to
wear
two
hats
here.
i'd
like
to
make
this
particular
point
because
we
think
it's
most
important.
the
argument
is
made
that
the
use
of
these
contractual
arrangements
are
not
subterfuges.
it
is
now
been
suggested
that
they
have
some
sort
of
a
practical
value.
this
record
will
not
support
that
whatsoever.
we
made
the
argument
from
the
commencement
and
sought
to
prove
it
as
much
as
we
could,
that
the
use
of
these
contractual
arrangement
was
solely
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
effect
of
federal
law
and
particularly
the
effect
of
36
(f)
and
36
(c).
we
showed
that
the
comptroller
had
reversed
himself
when
the
comptroller
became
mr.
saxon.
we
showed
that
mr.
saxon's
letters
in
explaining
his
rulings,
expressly
said
that
the
contractual
arrangements
were
used
so
that
36
(f)
should
not
be
applicable.
we
also
showed
that
first
national
bank
by
its
letters
to
the
comptroller
expressly
said
that
we
are
using
these
contractual
arrangements
because
exactly
as
you
required.
these
were
used
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
the
controller's
regulation
and
avoiding
the
effect
of
section
36
and
for
no
other
purpose.
now,
it's
been
suggested
that
there
might
be
another
legitimate
reason
for
using
the
contracts,
the
contractual
arrangements.
that
simply
won't
hold
water.
all
one
has
to
do
is
to
look
at
the
two
basic
contracts
that
are
involved,
the
so-called
dual
comptroller
contract
on
page
91
of
your
appendix
and
the
so-called
transmittal
slip
on
page
1
to
23
of
your
appendix.
and
any
lawyer
reading
that
can
see
quite
clearly
that
there
wasn't
any
attempt
here
to
limit
liability.
these
are
vastly
different
in
language
from
the
classical
night
depository
agreement
where
specifically
a
bailment
is
spelled
out.
the
district
court
did
not
make
a
finding
of
fact
that
first
national
was
not
receiving
deposits
off-premises.
the
district
court
said
as
a
matter
of
law
that
these
contracts
are
clear
and
unambiguous
on
their
face
and
the
district
court
therefore
refused
to
consider
the
purpose,
the
intent
of
the
contract
whatsoever.
we
made
the
same
presentation
to
the
court
of
appeal.
the
court
of
appeal
agreed
with
us
and
the
court
of
appeal
expressly
says
that
it
--
it
finds
plaintiffs'
arguments
of
agency
and
a
contract
indefensible.
it
finds
that
it's
engaged
in
the
use
of
paper
evasions
and
admittedly,
parties
can
contract,
a
bank
and
its
customer
can
contract
as
to
when
a
deposit
is
received.
but
this
cannot
be
done
for
the
purpose
of
frustrating
public
policy
for
the
purpose
of
evading
law
and
that
is
precisely
the
only
reason
these
arrangements
were
used
and
one
can
look
all
day
but
with
an
honest
heart,
you
can
find
no
other
answer
but
that.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
sir.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
we've
made
that
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir,
we've
made
just
about
all
the
alternative
arguments
that
we
could
and
we
take
that
one
too.
we
do
think
however
that
that's
very
--
that
is
an
important
point,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
no
sir,
we've
argued
as
i've
said,
four
different
points
of
view,
all
bringing
us
to
the
same
conclusion.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
the
government
hasn't
advanced
that
argument.
i
would
like
to
close
by
saying
one
thing
about
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion.
it's
been
urged
that
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
doesn't
follow
the
judge
lindberg
approach
which
we
urged
before
it,
but
that
somehow,
it
brings
into
effect
a
fourth
point
of
view,
a
fourth
approach
which
is
that
the
policy
of
competitive
equality
is
so
pervasive
that
virtually
all
of
premises
operation
are
going
to
be
defined
by
state
law.
we
do
not
support
that
view
as
respondents,
but
i
will
confess,
we'll
be
perfectly
glad
to
accept
it
because
our
point
here
is
to
win
a
lawsuit
and
that
point
of
view
will
win
our
lawsuit
as
well
as
the
others
will.
we
do
say
however
that
the
fifth
circuit
holding
does
not
stand
for
that
proposition.
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
hold
so
broadly.
and
we
call
attention
to
this
fact.
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
must
be
read
in
the
context
of
the
arguments
which
were
made
before
it.
we
argued
alternative
positions
as
we
do
here,
but
we
argued
primarily
first
that
the
contractual
arrangements
are
evasions
to
obviate
the
effect
of
section
36
(f)
and
to
frustrate
competitive
equality.
secondly,
we
relied
upon
the
functional
test
set
forth
in
judge
lindberg's
opinion.
and
thirdly,
we
said
that
this
approach
made
florida
law
applicable.
and
the
fifth
court
expressly
holds
seriatim.
first,
that
it
rejects
petitioner's
arguments
of
agency
and
contract,
that
it
finds
the
contractual
arrangements
and
attempt
to
evade
the
wishes
of
congress,
that
judge
lindberg's
approach
is
approved
and
only
then
does
the
fifth
circuit
look
to
the
florida
law.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
sir?
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
is
a
branch
bank
for
(voice
overlap),
it
is
sir
for
the
purposes
of
section
36
(f),
for
the
purposes
of
determining
whether
it
is
a
branch
at
--
section
36
said
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir,
and
lots
of
nice
sign
both
on
the
side
of
the
armored
car
and
in
the
depository
area.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir,
there
is
no
question.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
it's
on
the
inside
mall
of
the
city's
only
large
shopping
center,
right
next
door
to
all
of
the
new
chain
stores
that
moved
in
to
town.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
and
says
this
is
the
first
national
bank's
messenger
service.
the
point
i
make
is
an
important
--
the
point
i
make
is
an
important
one
for
this
reason.
as
i
pointed
out,
number
one,
first
national
got
all
of
their
big
accounts
out
of
this
shopping
center
because
of
the
location
of
its
depositories.
secondly,
at
the
time
that
first
national
sought
authority
from
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
for
these
two
operations,
the
hillsborough
bank
was
building
its
first
new
bank
building
in
40
years.
it
was
the
only
bank
in
plant
city
that
survived
the
depression
and
it
took
a
long
time
to
get
enough
money
to
build
a
new
bank.
first
national,
rather,
plant
city's
hillsborough's
banking
experience
had
indicated
that
within
a
given
period
of
time,
the
deposits
at
the
hillsborough
because
of
the
new
building
should
increase
by
about
$2
million.
when
that
time
arrived,
the
deposits
had
increased
only
$200,000
and
by
that
time,
first
national
was
handling
over
a
$1
million
a
week
through
this
service
ranging
over
18
miles
going
into
additional
trade
areas
serving,
incidentally,
mr.
justice
black,
the
little
city
of
dover
is
served
by
this
armored
car.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
a
little
city
of
dover,
florida
and
it's
a
good
deal
more
than
two
filling
stations.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
no
sir,
there
is
no
bank
there.
of
course,
it's
argued
in
briefs
that
these
things
which
the
first
national
has
got
and
the
hillsborough
lost
just
show
the
value
of
the
service
of
convenience.
but
i
point
out
again
that
this
is
precisely
the
question
which
congress
was
concerned
with
when
it
faced
this
problem
in
enacting
the
mcfadden
act
and
it
held
a
service
and
convenience
is
the
question
for
local
determination.
and
if
that's
to
be
changed,
if
operations
off-premises
that
affect
the
basic
like
blood
function
of
bank
are
to
be,
or
not
to
fall
within
section
36
(f),
we
submit
that
it
is
solely
for
congress
to
make
that
decision.
thank
you.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
finally
deliver
what
prepared
remarks
i
have,
i'd
like
to
speak
to
some
of
the
questions
which
arose
from
the
bench.
i
don't
want
mr.
edwards
to
appear
to
be
the
only
expert
on
plant
city
florida
here
and
as
much
as
that's
where
i
was
reared.
and
the
other
bank,
the
state
bank,
the
hillsborough
bank
is
the
bank
in
which
my
family
is
interested,
so
we
have
a
little
local
situation
here.
mr.
springer
talked
about
the
messenger
riding
the
truck.
somehow,
it's
been
overlooked
that
there's
also
a
trained,
paid
teller
on
this
truck,
trained
by
the
bank
to
do
all
of
the
functions
that
a
teller
does
in
a
bank.
both
of
these
gentlemen
have
referred
to
the
depository
as
a
hole
in
the
wall
in
the
shopping
center.
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
page
387
of
the
appendix
in
this
cause
to
take
a
look
at
the
hole
in
the
wall.
what
happened
here
was
is
that
plant
city
got
its
first
large
shopping
center
in
its
history
and
first
national
went
out
to
that
shopping
center
and
rented
a
store
and
then
set
up
its
depository
in
the
store
within
the
interior
mall
next
to
the
new
chain
stores
which
were
moving
into
the
community.
and
when
the
shopping
center
opened,
what
happened?
first
national
got
every
new
account,
every
large
new
account
out
of
that
shopping
center
because
it
got
the
advantage
of
location
which
is
so
important
in
banking.
the
hillsborough
bank,
the
older
bank,
the
larger
bank,
the
one
that
one
might
assume
would
get
a
little
business
out
of
it
got
absolutely
not
a
new
customer.
the
picture
shows
that
there's
a
good
deal
and
more
there
than
a
hole
in
the
wall
and
that
is
my
point.
secondly,
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
it
does,
sir.
we
so
interpret
it.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
well,
there
are
two
arguments,
mr.
justice
black.
i
think,
first
is,
what
is
the
test
to
determine
branching
under
12
u.s.c.--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
practically
speaking,
what
is
it
the
core
of
it
is
that
the
national
bank
through
the
ruling
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
which
completely
reverses
the
rulings
that
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
had
been
making
for
over
40
years
as
to
armored
cars
and
as
to
depositories
has
gained
a
competitive
advantage
over
the
state
banks
in
the
state
of
florida
in
the
performance
of
basic
essentials
of
banking.
to
use
a
not
very
polite
term,
the
guts
of
banking,
may
it
please
the
court,
are
the
getting
hold
of
money,
getting
deposits.
the
cash
--
paying
of
checks
and
the
making
of
loans
and
congress
said
under
36
(f)
that
anyone
of
those
things
which
should
be
defined
as
a
branch
for
purposes
of
36
(f)
and
ultimately
for
purposes
of
reference
to
state
law.
anyone
of
them
and
certainly
one
is
clearly
involved
here
which
is
receiving
deposits
and
i'm
talking
about
the
functional
act
of
receiving
deposits,
the
getting
the
advantage
of
getting
the
money
which
is
precisely
what
first
national
is
doing.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
that's
right.
except
the
--
in
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
oh!
yes
sir,
it
can.
but
that's
a
matter
of
policy
that
congress
left
for
local
determination
saying
that
a
state
would
have
to
decide
whether
branching
in
this
area
should
or
should
not
be
allowed.
[inaudible]
state
bank
can't
dictate
state
policy
on
those
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
is
true.
they
could
do
that.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
a
satis
--
its
certainly
not
a
satisfactory
way
to
combat
the
armored
car
operations
because
it
does
a
good
deal
more,
may
it
please
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
i
do
indeed
sir.
under
section
36
(f),
i
do
indeed.
it
is
an
--
that
36
(f)
says,
any
place
is
the
branch
bank
which
is
an
agency,
an
office
or
a
place
of
business
where
either
deposits
are
received,
checks
are
paid
or
money
is
lent
and
that's
precisely
what's
involved
here.
we've
certainly
--
the
armored
car
is
either
an
agency
or
an
office
or
a
place
of
business.
so
too
is
the
depository.
we
have
lots
of
laundromats
in
that
part
of
the
world
but
you
don't
have
any
people
out
there
but
they
are
certainly
places
of
business
and
this
depository
in
the
shopping
center
is
clearly
a
place
of
business
where
first
national
bank
gets
a
competitive
advantage
in
the
control
of
an
essential
of
banking,
that
is
receiving
deposits
and
their
only,
only
way
they
seek
to
avoid
the
argument
which
i
make
and
the
way
that
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
said
is
the
way
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
said
they
could.
the
comptroller
as
i
have
said,
reversed
himself.
they're
over
20
inconsistent
rulings
since
1929
with
the
ruling
the
comptroller
made
when
he
authorized
this.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
had
disapproved
and
discouraged
armored
car
operations
and
depository
operations
of
this
sort
on
the
ground
that
they
were
branch
banking
under
36
(f).
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir.
we
subpoenaed
the
complete
precedence
file
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
we
tried
to
take
his
deposition,
they
wouldn't
let
us
do
that,
but
we
got
the
complete
precedence
file
and
it
is
in
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
the
comptroller
is
saying
that
they
were
not
authorized
in
states
which
were
non-branching
states
because
they
would
violate
the
provisions
of
36
(f)
and
(c).
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
i
don't
know
what
mr.
springer's
argument
is,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
may
be
precisely
what
ours
is.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
we--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
respondents
take
this
position,
mr.
justice
harlan.
we
say
that
there
are
about
four
different
views
which
have
been
advanced
to
you.
the
first
is
that
36
(f)
is
to
be
narrowly
construed
without
any
reference
whatsoever
to
the
competitive
equality
upon
which
the
section
clearly
was
based
in
its
enactment.
we
say
that's
wrong.
we
made
this
argument
before
the
district
court.
it
took
that
view
but
we
say,
even,
even
in
that
event,
if
that
is
the
correct
view,
then
we
still
should
have
prevailed
because
the
contractual
arrangement
or
fictitious
the
court
should
look
the
form
to
substance,
there
is
no
real
agency
relationship
and
accordingly
even
by
a
common
law
principle,
agent
to
the
bank
are
authorized
to
receive
deposits
and
are
therefore
receiving
deposits
off-premises.
that's
the
first
argument.
the
second
argument
is,
we
made
an
argument
that
36
(f)
was
exclusively
def
--
exclusively
federal.
it
was
a
complete
definition
without
any
reference
to
state
law,
but
it
should
be
construed
broadly
and
liberally
for
the
purpose
of
effectuating
competitive
equality.
and
this
view
incidentally
is
one
of
the
position
which
is
taken
in
a
little
pamphlet
by
the
legislative
reference
section
of
the
library
of
congress
in
evaluating
certain
of
mr.
saxon's
rulings
and
it
suggests
a
broad
construction.
we
argued
that
construction
before
the
district
court
until
we
found
judge
lindberg's
unpublished
opinion
in
state
chartered
banks
then
we
had
an
authority
better
than
a
pamphlet
from
library
of
congress.
and
so
we
began
to
rely
without
moving
away
from
the
other
argument,
but
arguing
in
the
alternative,
we
began
to
rely
on
judge
lindberg's
state
chartered
bank's
decision
which
is
that
36
(f)
is
a
partial
definition
where
function
is
the
important
thing.
function
and
physicality
that
is
presents
a
prima
facie
test
of
banking,
of
branch
banking
under
the
federal
definition
and
if
the
operation
meets
that
prima
facie
test,
then
the
threshold
is
crossed
and
you
look
to
state
law.
now,
we
support
that
view
before
this
court
and
recommend
it
to
this
court
as
being
the
best
view.
it
provides
guidelines.
it's
flexible.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
sir?
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
judge
lindberg
faced
with
a
similar
problem
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
he
is
a
district
judge
in
washington
sir
and
he
was
the
one
who
--
one
of
the
ones
who
grappled
with
this
thing
in
greatest
depth
first.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
he
took
the
position
that
36
(f)
provided
a
partial
functional
definition
of
branch
banking
and
that
if
a
given
activity
met
that
functional
definition
then
the
threshold
was
crossed
and
one
should
look
to
state
law.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
think,
i
would
have
to
admit
that
but
i
would
also
point
out
that
in
1927
in
the
mc
--
at
the
time
that
mcfadden
act
was
being
debated,
that
there
were
many
people
who
argued
that
branch
banking
was
a
progressive
service.
that
it
offered
service
and
convenience
to
the
customer
and
congress
decided
in
phrasing
the
mcfadden
act
as
it
did
and
taking
the
approach
that
it
did,
that
the
question
of
service
and
convenience
in
this
area
should
be
left
for
local
determination.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
in
terms
of
the
operation
in
hand,
i
would
say,
it
was
national
sir.
i
think
it's
that
the
operations
of
this
sort
are
being
considered
and
battled
all
over
the
country.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
is,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
just
--
i
think
it's
a
different
method
of
operation
in
addition
to
sending
them
in
by
mail.
the
advertisement
of
this
bank,
advertisers
that
they
have
banking
by
mail
and
say
they
also
furnish
this
service.
to
be
perfectly
candid
sir,
i
see
no
justification
for
this
operation
whatsoever
in
the
way
that
first
national
set
it
up
except
to
gain
a
competitive
advantage.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i
understand
that.
and
my
response
to
the
need
of
your
village
sir
was
that
--
is
that
in
the
context
of
this
lawsuit,
if
the
service
was
needed
and
the
state
of
alabama
decided
that
it
should
allow
the
activity
then
that's
properly
the
case
but
it
was
for
alabama
to
decide
that
and
not
for
the
federal
government
when
one
is
dealing
with
the
three
essential
functions
here.
i
say
not
with
the
federal
government,
i
don't
really
mean
to
say
that
because
congress
can
change
the
definition
of
36
(c)
and
36
(f)
if
it
wants
to.
congress
can
take
an
entirely
different
approach,
but
i
respectfully
submit
that
it
is
solely
for
congress
to
do
it
and
it
is
not
for
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
by
rulings,
it's
not
for
the
first
national
bank
of
plant
city
and
indeed
with
respect,
it's
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir.
that
is
precisely
my
point.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
no
sir,
i
don't.
i
don't
know
that
much
about
banking.
mr.
bell
who'll
speak
in
a
few
minutes
and
he
is
much
better
informed
in
that
area
than
i
am.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
not
in
the
appendix,
no
sir.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
it
is
in
the
original
record,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
no
sir,
he
would
not,
so
long
as
he
was
a
common
carrier
for
hire
and
had
certificate
from
our
public
utilities
commission.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
for
the
purpose
of
going
out
to
say
a
large
commercial
customer
who
wanted
its
moneys
taken
into
the
bank
but
there's
a
great
distinction,
may
it
please
the
court,
between
the
brinks
for
example,
offering
that
service
and
the
first
national
bank
in
plant
city
either
offering
it
through
its
own
armored
car
are
alternatively
through
first
national
hiring
and
controlling
brinks.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
sir.
i
think
the
public
utilities
commission
of
florida
is
going
to
have
a
little
of
this
before
its
over
because
when
the
bank
begins
to
receive
money
for
the
service,
it
is
in
my
judgment
at
least
going
to
be
involved
in
operating
common
carrier
for
hiring,
we're
going
to
have
a
new
battle
over
that
setting.
that's
the
reason,
they're
not
charging
at
the
present
time.
they're
afraid
to.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
think
that
is
possible,
it
could
do
that.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
well,
i
think
we
have
to
be
careful
with
our
example,
mr.
justice
white
but
to
take
an
easy
one;
the
bank
can
operate
a
travel
agency,
a
state
bank
can
operate
a
travel
agency
in
florida
as
part
of
the
business
of
banking
and
i
certainly
wouldn't
get
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
sir?
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
so
far
as
i
know,
it
does
it
on
the
premises,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
i
think
that
is
possible,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
that
the
argument
here
is
the
reverse
of
that,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
well,
we
go
back
to
the
test,
how
do
we
get
there?
in
the
first
place,
is
this
an
activity
which
falls
within
36
(f)
from
a
functional
point
of
view.
does
it
involve
the
basic
essentials
of
banking?
we
say
that
it
does.
therefore,
the
reference
must
the
state
law.
at
that
level,
national
and
state
banks
will
be
treated
exactly
the
same
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
--
by
florida
law.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
no
sir,
i
don't
make
that
argument.
i
make
the
argument
that
first,
federal
law
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
that
is
true
sir.
i
make
the
argument
that
when
one
is
dealing
with
the
essentials
of
banking
as
is
the
case
here,
that
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
activity
is
a
branch,
you
first
must
apply
36
(f).
in
the
event
that
the
activity
is
one
of
those
three
things
then
the
reference
is
the
state
law.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
it
is
a
branch
for
purposes
of
36
(f),
yes
sir.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
think
that
result
can
be
reached
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
that
is
true
and
congress
was
not
concerned
with
and
did
not
try
in
the
mcfadden
act
in
this
branching
area
to
give
complete
equality.
we
don't
contend
that
complete
equality
is
required.
we
contend
that
a
competitive
equality
is
required
as
to
the
basic
functions
of
banking
and
that
no
contract,
no
notice
can
change
the
fact
that
what
first
national
doing
here
is
getting
control
of
money
off-premises.
the
contracts
don't
mean
a
hill
of
banes
to
the
local
expression,
excuse
me.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
i'm
sorry
sir.
i
can't
hear
you.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
they
never
put
two
aboard
sir
but
that
is
an
interesting
fact.
it
is
--
the
presentation
has
been
made
here
that
they
--
they
only
were
--
or
doing
a
rather
limited
thing
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
this
litigation
broke
out
almost
contemporaneously
with
the
commencement
of
these
two
operations.
and
the
early
advertising
within
days
before
the
litigation
commenced,
as
mr.
justice
black
notes
on
page
389
the
record
says,
richard
was
the
bank's
president,
described
the
car
as
a
mobile
drive-in,
staffed
by
an
armed
guard
and
two
tellers.
it
has
a
large
window
where
customers
may
be
served
and
a
communication
system.
now,
they
contend
that
they
haven't
served
any
customers
from
this
counter,
this
complete
teller's
window
which
is
on
the
side
of
it.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
that
it's
just
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
there's
none
sir.
and
at
that
place
that
to
which
you
refer,
they
are
receiving
deposits
and
therefore,
if
they
do
it
to
the
armored
car,
they
are
likewise
receiving
deposits.
there
is
one
point
that
i
would
like
to
refer
to
before
it
slips
my
mind.
the
presentation
is
--
has
been
made
here
that
all
that
is
--
has
happened
in
this
operation
is
that
money
has
been
delivered
to
customers
and
picked
up
and
brought
back.
this
is
done
routinely,
six
days
a
week
by
the
armored
car.
the
armored
car
calls
upon
the
depository,
twice
everyday.
at
the
depository,
it
is
not
only
night
bags
that
are
placed
into
the
depository,
but
also
envelopes
containing
the
transmittal
slip
which
is
really
just
a
regular
deposit
slip
with
the
conjured
language
on
the
back
of
it
in
trying
to
make
an
agency
out
of
it
and
this
is
the
most
important
point
because
it
should
resolve
this
case
below
and
we
should
have
never
been
here.
the
district
court
held
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
first
national
was
paying
checks
through
this
operation
because
it
would
actually
deliver
the
cash
to
a
customer,
say
it,
over
a
cash
store
and
take
a
check
in
return
drawn
on
the
bank
that
is
paying
checks,
that's
a
section
36
function.
but
the
district
court
strangely
enough
said,
it
isn't
going
to
approve
that,
but
it
will
approve
the
rest
of
the
operation
because
the
first
national
is
otherwise
substantially
complied
with
the
comptroller
of
the
currency's
ruling.
and
we've
never
been
on
this
--
we've
constantly
argued
that
this
was
wrong,
we
made
this
point
to
the
fifth
circuit
but
the
fifth
circuit
didn't
reach
it.
we
do
not
see
how
if
in
the
course
of
the
operation
of
the
armored
car.
there
was
a
paying
of
check
operation
that
that
can
be
ignored
for
the
purposes
of
definition
of
36
(f).
the
argument
is
made
that
the
question
is
moot
because
first
national
promised
to
stop
it,
but
number
one,
the
record
doesn't
show
that
they

two,
they're
not
restrained
by
the
district
court
from
doing
it;
number
three,
we
are
restrained
from
interfering
with
them,
so
we
can't

what's
going

and

four,
the
promise
to
stop

sir?
mr.
william

with
these
operations.
mr.
william
reece

jr.
by
the
district
court's
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
sir?
which
decided
(voice

mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
no,
we
were
the
defendant.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
there
is
actually,
the
order
wasn't
entered
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
--
because
the
parties
agreed
to
abide
by
the
court's
decision
but
it's
the
same
thing.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
from
interfering
with
these
operations
in
any
way.
see,
i
now
--
i'm
speaking
here
not
only
for
the
intervener
state
banks
whom
i
represented
in
the
first
instance
but
i
speak
here
also
for
the
state
comptroller
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
--
of
the
state
of
florida
and
the
court
entered
an
order
that
the
comptroller
at
the
state
of
florida
should
no
longer
interfere
with
these
operations
by
first
national
bank.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
no
sir,
i'm
trying
to
wear
two
hats
here.
i'd
like
to
make
this
particular
point
because
we
think
it's
most
important.
the
argument
is
made
that
the
use
of
these
contractual
arrangements
are
not
subterfuges.
it
is
now
been
suggested
that
they
have
some
sort
of
a
practical
value.
this
record
will
not
support
that
whatsoever.
we
made
the
argument
from
the
commencement
and
sought
to
prove
it
as
much
as
we
could,
that
the
use
of
these
contractual
arrangement
was
solely
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
effect
of
federal
law
and
particularly
the
effect
of
36
(f)
and
36
(c).
we
showed
that
the
comptroller
had
reversed
himself
when
the
comptroller
became
mr.
saxon.
we
showed
that
mr.
saxon's
letters
in
explaining
his
rulings,
expressly
said
that
the
contractual
arrangements
were
used
so
that
36
(f)
should
not
be
applicable.
we
also
showed
that
first
national
bank
by
its
letters
to
the
comptroller
expressly
said
that
we
are
using
these
contractual
arrangements
because
exactly
as
you
required.
these
were
used
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
the
controller's
regulation
and
avoiding
the
effect
of
section
36
and
for
no
other
purpose.
now,
it's
been
suggested
that
there
might
be
another
legitimate
reason
for
using
the
contracts,
the
contractual
arrangements.
that
simply
won't
hold
water.
all
one
has
to
do
is
to
look
at
the
two
basic
contracts
that
are
involved,
the
so-called
dual
comptroller
contract
on
page
91
of
your
appendix
and
the
so-called
transmittal
slip
on
page
1
to
23
of
your
appendix.
and
any
lawyer
reading
that
can
see
quite
clearly
that
there
wasn't
any
attempt
here
to
limit
liability.
these
are
vastly
different
in
language
from
the
classical
night
depository
agreement
where
specifically
a
bailment
is
spelled
out.
the
district
court
did
not
make
a
finding
of
fact
that
first
national
was
not
receiving
deposits
off-premises.
the
district
court
said
as
a
matter
of
law
that
these
contracts
are
clear
and
unambiguous
on
their
face
and
the
district
court
therefore
refused
to
consider
the
purpose,
the
intent
of
the
contract
whatsoever.
we
made
the
same
presentation
to
the
court
of
appeal.
the
court
of
appeal
agreed
with
us
and
the
court
of
appeal
expressly
says
that
it
--
it
finds
plaintiffs'
arguments
of
agency
and
a
contract
indefensible.
it
finds
that
it's
engaged
in
the
use
of
paper
evasions
and
admittedly,
parties
can
contract,
a
bank
and
its
customer
can
contract
as
to
when
a
deposit
is
received.
but
this
cannot
be
done
for
the
purpose
of
frustrating
public
policy
for
the
purpose
of
evading
law
and
that
is
precisely
the
only
reason
these
arrangements
were
used
and
one
can
look
all
day
but
with
an
honest
heart,
you
can
find
no
other
answer
but
that.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
sir.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
we've
made
that
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir,
we've
made
just
about
all
the
alternative
arguments
that
we
could
and
we
take
that
one
too.
we
do
think
however
that
that's
very
--
that
is
an
important
point,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
no
sir,
we've
argued
as
i've
said,
four
different
points
of
view,
all
bringing
us
to
the
same
conclusion.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
the
government
hasn't
advanced
that
argument.
i
would
like
to
close
by
saying
one
thing
about
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion.
it's
been
urged
that
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
doesn't
follow
the
judge
lindberg
approach
which
we
urged
before
it,
but
that
somehow,
it
brings
into
effect
a
fourth
point
of
view,
a
fourth
approach
which
is
that
the
policy
of
competitive
equality
is
so
pervasive
that
virtually
all
of
premises
operation
are
going
to
be
defined
by
state
law.
we
do
not
support
that
view
as
respondents,
but
i
will
confess,
we'll
be
perfectly
glad
to
accept
it
because
our
point
here
is
to
win
a
lawsuit
and
that
point
of
view
will
win
our
lawsuit
as
well
as
the
others
will.
we
do
say
however
that
the
fifth
circuit
holding
does
not
stand
for
that
proposition.
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
hold
so
broadly.
and
we
call
attention
to
this
fact.
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
must
be
read
in
the
context
of
the
arguments
which
were
made
before
it.
we
argued
alternative
positions
as
we
do
here,
but
we
argued
primarily
first
that
the
contractual
arrangements
are
evasions
to
obviate
the
effect
of
section
36
(f)
and
to
frustrate
competitive
equality.
secondly,
we
relied
upon
the
functional
test
set
forth
in
judge
lindberg's
opinion.
and
thirdly,
we
said
that
this
approach
made
florida
law
applicable.
and
the
fifth
court
expressly
holds
seriatim.
first,
that
it
rejects
petitioner's
arguments
of
agency
and
contract,
that
it
finds
the
contractual
arrangements
and
attempt
to
evade
the
wishes
of
congress,
that
judge
lindberg's
approach
is
approved
and
only
then
does
the
fifth
circuit
look
to
the
florida
law.
mr.
william
reece

is
a
branch

for

it
is

for
the
purposes
of

for
the
purposes
of
determining

section
36
said
--
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir,
and
lots
of
nice
sign
both
on
the
side
of
the
armored
car
and
in
the
depository
area.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
yes
sir,
there
is
no
question.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
it's
on
the
inside
mall
of
the
city's
only
large
shopping
center,
right
next
door
to
all
of
the
new
chain
stores
that
moved
in
to
town.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
and
says
this
is
the
first
national
bank's
messenger
service.
the
point
i
make
is
an
important
--
the
point
i
make
is
an
important
one
for
this
reason.
as
i
pointed
out,
number
one,
first
national
got
all
of
their
big
accounts
out
of
this
shopping
center
because
of
the
location
of
its
depositories.
secondly,
at
the
time
that
first
national
sought
authority
from
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
for
these
two
operations,
the
hillsborough
bank
was
building
its
first
new
bank
building
in
40
years.
it
was
the
only
bank
in
plant
city
that
survived
the
depression
and
it
took
a
long
time
to
get
enough
money
to
build
a
new
bank.
first
national,
rather,
plant
city's
hillsborough's
banking
experience
had
indicated
that
within
a
given
period
of
time,
the
deposits
at
the
hillsborough
because
of
the
new
building
should
increase
by
about
$2
million.
when
that
time
arrived,
the
deposits
had
increased
only
$200,000
and
by
that
time,
first
national
was
handling
over
a
$1
million
a
week
through
this
service
ranging
over
18
miles
going
into
additional
trade
areas
serving,
incidentally,
mr.
justice
black,
the
little
city
of
dover
is
served
by
this
armored
car.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
a
little
city
of
dover,
florida
and
it's
a
good
deal
more
than
two
filling
stations.
mr.
william
reece
smith,
jr.
no
sir,
there
is
no
bank
there.
of
course,
it's
argued
in
briefs
that
these
things
which
the
first
national
has
got
and
the
hillsborough
lost
just
show
the
value
of
the
service
of
convenience.
but
i
point
out
again
that
this
is
precisely
the
question
which
congress
was
concerned
with
when
it
faced
this
problem
in
enacting
the
mcfadden
act
and
it
held
a
service
and
convenience
is
the
question
for
local
determination.
and
if
that's
to
be
changed,
if
operations
off-premises
that
affect
the
basic
like
blood
function
of
bank
are
to
be,
or
not
to
fall
within
section
36
(f),
we
submit
that
it
is
solely
for
congress
to
make
that
decision.
thank
you.
