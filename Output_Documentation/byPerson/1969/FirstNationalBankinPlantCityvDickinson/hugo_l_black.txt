i'm

that's
it
--
let's
take
a
village
at
a
little
distant
from
plant
city,
20
miles
and
you
find
that
the
plant
city
sends
this
traveling
bank
or
traveling
whatever
it
is
into
that
community
and
it
can
get
the
deposits.
now,
how
can
the
state
bank
at
plant
city
compete
with
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
you'd
say
it
should
pass
the
law
and
not
authorize
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
can
send
in
their
deposits
by
mail.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
a
satisfactory
way
of
doing
business?
justice
hugo

black
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
armored
car
is
in

a
moving
ambulatory
bank?
justice

black
why
did
--
you
said
the
rule
had
been
otherwise
for
20
years,
what
had
been
the
rule
for
20
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
ground,
is
that
in
the
record?
justice

they
had
been
called
branch

for
20
years,
this

what

justice

well,
i
suppose,
you
would
admit
this
is
a
progressive
service
in
the
banking
business,
wouldn't
you?
justice

is
this
national

justice

black
is
this
a

justice

i
presume
this

is
intended
to
supplant
the
old
way
of
sending
in
the
deposits
by
mail,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
that
a
justification
to
it
pragmatically
speaking,
i
thought
you
were
arguing
on
the
legal
basis
that
it's
not
fair
competition.
i
grew
up
in
a
town
which
was
a
village
which
was
400
people
and
25
miles
from
the
closest
bank.
all
our
business
was
done
by
mail.
justice

and
of
course,
that
would've
been
--
we
would've
had
a
great
advantage.
we
would
have
had
this
system
of
making
deposits.
justice
hugo

and
you're
telling
that
congress
hasn't
done
this,
but
the
comptroller
of
the

justice
hugo
l.
black
it
abandoned
the
old
practice
which
has
been
existing
for
20
years
and
done
this
and
then
it
violates
the
federal
law,
is
that
it?
justice

may
i
ask
you
what,
what
is
meant
by
on

the

you
showed

that
the

what's

that

must
