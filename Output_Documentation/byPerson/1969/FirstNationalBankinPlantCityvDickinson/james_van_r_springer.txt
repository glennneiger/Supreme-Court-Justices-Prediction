mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
are
two
consolidated
cases
reviewing
the
same
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
ultimate
question
presented
is
whether
state
banking
authorities
can
prevent
a
national
bank
from
providing
its
customers
with
an
armored
car
messenger
service
to
and
from
the
bank,
if
they
can
do
so
on
the
theory
that
such
a
service
amounts
to
the
operation
of
a
branch
governed
by
a
state
law
under
the
national
bank
act.
section
36
(c)
of
that
act
provides
in
general
term
that
a
national
bank
may
establish
and
operate
a
branch
if
a
state
bank
similarly
situated
would
be
authorized
under
state
law
to
do
so.
florida,
where
this
case
arises
is
a
state
that
does
not
permit
branch
banking
at
all
and
it
is
further
established
for
present
purposes
at
least
that
a
florida
state
bank
would
not
be
permitted
by
the
state
authorities
to
operate
the
messenger
service
here
in
question.
i
might
say
parenthetically
the
reason
it's
established
for
present
purposes
only
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
noted
in
its
opinion
that
there
is
litigation
pending
in
a
florida
state
court
where
this
issue
had
been
raised
for
the
first
time
that
will
resolve
presumably
as
a
matter
of
state
interpretation
whether
or
not
this
kind
of
service
is
in
fact
prohibited
by
the
florida
statute.
however,
subject
to
the
outcome
of
that
litigation
which
the
florida
court
has
stayed
until
this
court
decides
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
the
interpretation
of
the
florida
state
banking
commissioner
who
was
one
of
the
respondents
here
that
the
florida
statute
would
prohibit
this
kind
of
service
subject
only
to
a
retention
of
jurisdiction
by
the
district
court
to
change
its
order.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
yes,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
fact,
it
seemed
a
little
strange
to
me
that
the
florida
court
would
stay
itself
pending
determination
of
this
case,
but
it
in
fact
until
is
done
so.
in
any
event,
nobody
knows
what
will
happen
to
that
litigation
and
unless
something
does
happen,
the
court
of
appeals
has
in
effect
decided
that
this
service
cannot
proceed.
the
issue
therefore
in
this
case
is
whether
the
kind
of
messenger
service
involved
here
is
a
branch,
being
of
course
the
term
of
order
of
the
national
bank
act.
if
it's
a
branch
then
36
(c)
of
the
national
bank
act
makes
its
legality
depend
upon
state
law
and
as
i
have
said,
state
law
for
present
purposes
forbids
it.
if
it
is
not
a
branch
then
its
legality
depends
only
upon
the
provisions
of
the
national
bank
act
relating
to
the
powers
of
national
banks
which
do
not
refer
to
state
law
and
are
not
in
issue
in
this
case.
as
we
see
it,
the
definitional
problem
that
this
case
presents
breaks
down
really
into
two
questions.
the
first
question
is
the
threshold
question
of
where
we
look
for
the
criteria
to
determine,
“what
is
a
branch?”
we
say
that
naturally
enough
one
would
look
to
subsection
(f)
of
the
branching
section
of
the
national
bank
act
section
36,
which
says
that
the
term
“branch”
is
used
in
this
section
shall
be
held
to
include
any
branch
bank,
branch
office,
branch
agency,
additional
office
or
any
branch
place
of
business
at
which
deposits
are
received
or
checks
paid
or
money
lent.
the
court
of
appeals
said
however,
that
30
--
section
36
(f)
is
hardly
adequate
as
a
definition,
those
are
the
words
that
it
used,
and
therefore
that
the
law
of
florida
should
determine
what
is
a
branch
for
purposes
of
this
incorporation
of
state
law
that's
provided
for
in
section
36
(c).
as
i've
indicated
if
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
that
in
the
case
here,
if
we're
right
there
remains
a
further
question
whether
the
district
court
properly
held
that
the
armored
car
messenger
service
in
question
here
was
not
branch
banking
as
a
matter
of
purely
federal
law
under
the
section
36
definition
which
the
district
court
treated
as
the
exclusive
definition
and
of
course
if
the
district
court
was
right,
then
florida
law
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case.
there
are
--
these
main
two
cases,
there
are
two
petitioners
here,
comptroller
of
the
currency
who
has
authorized
the
service
in
question
and
the
first
national
bank
in
plant
city,
florida,
which
is
the
bank
that's
conducting
the
service.
there
will
be
argument
on
behalf
of
each
petitioner.
in
my
argument
i
plan
to
cover
the
first
of
the
questions
that
i've
mentioned,
the
choice
of
law
question,
which
has
importance
not
only
for
this
particular
kind
of
service
but
for
a
variety
of
other
services
that
national
banks
offer
or
may
wish
to
offer.
mr.
edwards
who
will
be
arguing
on
behalf
of
the
bank
will
deal
primarily
with
the
second
question
which
assumes
that
of
course
that
if
we
prevail
on
the
first
question,
the
question
as
to
how
the
facts
of
this
particular
service
relate
to
the
federal
definition
in
section
36
(f)
if
that
is
in
fact
the
governing
definition.
that
question
of
course
also
has
great
importance
because
there
are
a
great
variety
or
a
great
number
of
national
banks
throughout
the
country
that
provides
services
or
interested
in
providing
services
of
the
general
nature
of
the
services
that
are
involved
in
plant
city.
because
of
this
division,
i
would
hope
to
limit
my
statement
of
the
case
to
a
very
brief
statement
of
how
the
case
arouse
and
the
fundamental
facts,
leaving
for
mr.
edwards
a
more
detailed
description
of
the
messenger
service
that's
involved
in
the
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
october
1966,
after
consultation
with
the
comptroller
of
the
currency's
office,
the
plant
city
national
bank
began
to
operate
its
messenger
service.
it
was
designed
for
the
benefit
of
customers
primarily
stores
in
the
outlying
areas
of
plant
city,
florida
which
is
a
city
of
about
18,000
people
some
20
miles
inland
from
tampa.
the
messenger
service
has
two
elements.
first,
an
armored
car,
which
pursues
a
daily
route
between
the
bank's
office
and
the
costumers'
places
of
business.
a
messenger
arrives
on
that
truck
and
he
receives
from
the
customer's
sealed
bags
containing
funds
for
deposit
in
the
bank
which
he
then
delivers
to
a
teller
at
the
bank's
office
who
opens
the
bags
and
then
treats
the
contents
as
deposits
when
they
are
received
at
the
bank.
the
messenger
also
delivers
to
the
customers
upon
prior
order
by
the
customers
sealed
bags
that
contains
change
or
funds
for
use
in
their
businesses
which
have
been
withdrawn
from
the
customers
accounts
before
the
truck
leaves
the
bank.
the
second
element
of
the
messenger
service
is
a
secured
receptacle,
which
is
literally
a
hole
in
the
wall
and
at
shopping
center
with
the
drop
slot
where
sealed
bags
or
envelops
containing
funds
for
deposit
in
the
bank
can
be
left
for
pickup
by
the
messenger
service
during
the
course
its
daily
rounds.
the
armored
car
operation
was
designed
to
comply
specifically
with
paragraph
7490
of
the
comptroller's
manual
for
national
banks,
which
is
a
compilation
of
pertinent
regulations
among
other
things.
that
paragraph
authorizes
such
an
operation
subject
to
the
condition
that
the
customer
understands
the
messenger
as
his
agent
and
not
the
bank's
and
that
any
funds
received
are
not
actually
deposits
until
the
teller
at
the
bank
accepts
them.
the
bank
also
obtained
with
respect
to
the
shopping
center
pickup
point
a
specific
ruling
from
the
comptroller's
office
that
that
was
permissible
subject
generally
to
the
same
conditions
that
i
mentioned.
underlying
both
rulings
of
course
was
a
determination
by
the
comptroller's
office
that
such
operations
subject
to
these
conditions
were
sound
and
safe
services
authorized
by
the
national
bank
as
incidence
to
the
conduct
of
a
banking
business
and
that
they
did
not
operate
to
the
--
amount
to
the
operation
of
a
branch
as
to
which
of
course
state
law
would
be
pertinent.
just
as
the
messenger
service
was
about
to
begin
its
operations,
the
respondent
dickinson,
who
was
the
florida
state
banking
commissioner
sent
a
letter
to
the
president
of
the
bank
and
expressing
the
view
that
the
services
would
violate
florida
law
and
threatening
suit
if
the
bank
did
not
cease
and
desist.
the
bank
promptly
began
this
suit
in
the
district
court
seeking
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction
to
prevent
such
state
interference
with
the
operation.
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
subsequently
intervened
as
a
plaintiff
and
the
respondent,
state
bank
here
also
intervened
as
defendants
on
the
side
of
the
state
commissioner.
at
the
outset
of
litigation,
the
district
court
entered
a
preliminary
injunction
allowing
messenger
service
to
continue
and
in
fact
that
preliminary
injunction
has
continued
in
effect
until
now
so
the
service
has
been
proceeding.
then
after
exploration
of
the
facts
and
affidavits
and
upon
reading
in
depth
voluminous
depositions
that
were
taken
in
the
case,
the
district
court
entered
summary
judgment
in
behalf
of
the
national
bank
and
the
comptroller.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
as
i
indicated
mr.
justice
black,
i
had
hoped
perhaps
that
mr.
edwards
in
his
portion
of
the
argument
could
describe
that
more
fully.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
will
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
as
i
indicate
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
does
not
bother
me
mr.
justice
black.
i
did
try
to
outline
the
general
language
it
operates.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
involves
an
armored
car
which
picks
up
from
customers,
generally
business
enterprises
in
the
outlying
areas
of
plant
city,
sealed
canvass
bags
containing
funds
which
they
wish
to
deposit
at
the
main
office
of
the
bank
in
downtown
plant
city.
it
receives
those,
turns
them
over
to
a
teller,
actually
two
officials
of
the
bank
at
the
office
who
then
open
the
bags,
count
the
money,
treat
the
money
as
if
it
were
then
deposited
at
the
point
when
it
reaches
the
bank.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
the
messenger
on
the
armored
car
does
do
that,
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
--
and
mr.
edwards
may
correct
me
and
i
believe
not.
i
believe
it's
only
incorporated
more
or
less
rural
areas
surrounding
this
shopping
center.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
they
are.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
it
is.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
in
the
sense
that
any
employee
would
be.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
though
of
course
the
con
--
there
are
contractual
relationships.
there's
a
specific
contract
with
each
customer
upon
whom
the
truck
calls.
there's
a
contract
in
which
the
customer
states
that
he
understands
it
that
in
fact
the
messenger
is
his
agent
not
the
banks
and
that
money
is
not
treated
as
a
deposit
until
it
is
actually
received
at
the
bank
which
of
course
has
substantial
practical
significance.
if
the
truck
were
robbed,
the
money
would
still
be
the
customer's
money
and
not
the
bank's
money.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it's
true
that
there
is
insurance
but
it
would
not
be
a
deposit
until
the
customer
for
example,
in
a
case
of
a
robbery,
obtained
recovery
from
the
insurance
company
and
then
gave
that
money
to
the
bank.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
the
bank
pays
for
the
insurance.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
he
does
not
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
understand
that
though
it's
--
i
suppose
not
strictly
part
of
the
record
though
it
has
been
contemplated
that
when
the
service
shakes
down,
and
i
don't
know
exactly
when
that
would
be
and
some
allocation
of
costs
could
be
made
then
perhaps
insurance
would
be
paid
by
the
customers,
but
it
is
true
that
there
is
now
no
charge
to
the
customers.
as
i
indicated,
the
district
court
agreed
with
what
this
--
in
substance
our
position
here
that
the
determination
whether
or
not
this
service
amounts
to
a
branch
is
one
of
purely
federal
law
in
the
application
of
the
definition
that's
set
forth
in
the
national
bank
act.
he
further
determined
that
this
service
did
not
amount
to
a
branch
that
the
comptroller
had
properly
so
determined
and
accordingly
the
service
was
allowed.
the
fifth
circuit
reversed,
taking
the
approach
that
the
question
whether
or
not
this
was
a
branch
and
therefore
whether
florida
law
would
be
incorporated
and
therefore
whether
florida
law
would
be
allowed
to
prohibit
this
service
was
a
question
of
state
law
and
that
since
florida
law
as
the
court
understood
it
regarded
this
activity
as
a
branch
therefore,
section
36
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
the
source
of
that
florida
law
as
to
what
was
a
branch,
was
ultimately
the
court
of
appeals'
notion
of
the
meaning
of
a
florida
statute,
which
in
fact
says
nothing
about
branching
or
about
branches
in
terms.
it
simply
says
any
bank
or
trust
company
shall
have
only
one
place
of
doing
business
and
skipping
a
bit
and
the
business
of
the
bank
or
trust
company
shall
be
transacted
at
its
banking
house
and
not
elsewhere.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that
is
true
mr.
justice
brennan.
there
is
a
fact
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
as
i
say
is
that
the
issue
in
a
court
and
a
case
which
is
now
on
a
--
at
a
lower
court
in
florida
which
of
course
may
work
its
way
up
through
the
system.
the
court
of
appeals
did
as
i
indicated
note
review
of
the
florida
banking
commissioner
and
did
to
be
frank
indicate
that
it
thought
that
was
a
reasonable
position,
so
it
was
not
and
an
out
reliance
simply
upon
the
ruling
of
a
florida
official.
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
leaves
us
what
seems
to
us
an
anomalous
principle
one
which
is
apparently
repudiated
in
this
court
by
the
respondents,
but
which
is
enthusiastically
supported
by
the
amicus
brief
that's
been
filed
on
behalf
of
the
national
association
of
state
bank
supervisors
who
i
understand
will
be
presenting
oral
argument
and
who
represent
all
50
of
the
state
banking
commissioners,
including
the
one
who
is
a
respondent
here.
we
believe
that
the
principle
followed
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
erroneous
and
that
it
is
one
that
would
be
highly
damaging
to
the
proper
regulation
of
the
national
bank
system.
we
think
that
a
straight
forward
reading
to
begin
with
of
section
36
of
the
national
bank
act
makes
it
quite
clear
that
section
36
is
designed
to
establish
a
uniform
and
exclusive
definition
of
what
is
a
national
bank
branch.
the
structure
of
section
36
remains
now
very
much
as
it
was
when
it
was
first
enacted
in
1927
as
section
7
of
the
mcfadden
act
which
for
the
first
time
allowed
national
banks
to
engage
in
branch
banking,
generally
speaking
on
the
same
terms
as
state
banks.
the
introductory
paragraph
of
section
36
provides
that
the
conditions
upon
which
a
national
bank
--
banking
association
may
retain
or
establish
and
operate
a
branch
or
branches
are
the
following
and
the
word
“branch”
appears
throughout
the
section
notably
in
subsection
(c)
to
which
i
have
referred,
which
says
that
“a
national
banking
association
may
with
the
approval
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
establish
and
operate
new
branches
if
such
establishment
and
operation
are
at
the
time
expressly
authorized
to
state
banks
by
the
law
of
the
state
in
question.”
now,
there
are
further
refinements
there
which
i
won't
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
acknowledge
that
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
not
entirely
clear
language
in
the
opinion.
i
think
that
the
ultimate
--
the
court's
statement
of
what
it
was
holding
and
it's
holding
in
fact
can
only
be
read
as
a
holding
that
if
state
law
regards
it's
as
a
branch,
it
is
therefore
a
branch
for
purposes
of
federal
law
and
therefore
state
substantive
law
of
branching
is
incorporated
by
section
36
(c).
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
in
fact
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
federal
law
is
hardly
adequate
as
a
definition
and
as
we
read
it,
i
have
seen
--
as
the
state
bank
supervisors
read
it,
i
believe
that
in
substance
it
does
amount
to
saying
that
if
state
law
calls
it
a
branch,
you
don't
have
to
look
at
the
federal
law.
that
seems
to
us
a
highly
anomalous
reading
of
a
subsection
of
a
federal
statute
which
says
that
the
term
“branch”
is
used
in
this
section
shall
be
held
to
include
any
branch
bank
office,
agency,
additional
office
at
which
deposits
or
receive
checks
paid
or
loans
or
money
lent.
congressman
mcfadden
who
is
of
course
the
sponsor
of
the
act
said
at
his
own
analysis
of
the
act
upon
its
passage
that
subsection
(f)
and
now
i'm
quoting
from
his
language
defines
the
term
“branch”
and
he
plays
outside
of
the
way
--
or
away
from
the
main
office
where
the
bank
carries
on
its
business
or
receiving
deposits,
paying
checks,
lending
money
or
transacting
business
at
the
main
office
is
a
branch.
and
of
course
this
question
of
“what
is
a
branch?”
is
relevant
for
a
variety
of
purposes
other
than
subsection
(c)
to
which
who
we
refer
in
our
brief,
including
sections
where
there
is
no
semblance
of
any
incorporation
of
state
law.
it
seems
unusual
that
congress
would
expect
that
these
--
that
the
definition
of
branch
for
these
purposes
would
vary
according
to
the
state
where
the
particular
national
bank
in
question
is
located
and
it
seems
even
more
anomalous
to
treat
the
word
“branch”
as
having
different
meanings
in
different
subsections
of
the
same
section
enacted
at
the
same
time.
as
we
further
detail
in
our
brief,
the
comptroller,
the
attorney
general
and
until
this
case,
the
federal
courts
have
all
treated
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
particular
enterprise
is
a
branch
as
a
question
of
federal
law
unaffected
by
local
law0
and
of
course
this
is
consistent
with
the
general
principle
that
when
congress
uses
a
word
unless
there's
some
reason
to
believe,
otherwise,
congress
intended
that
that
word
should
be
defined
and
interpreted
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
--
as
i
--
subject
to
what
i
said
before
that
that
is
true,
subject
to
a
possible
decision
of
the
contrary
by
the
florida
courts
where
the
question
as
--
but
for
present
purposes,
that
is
true.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
mr.
justice,
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
we
say
that
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it's
argued
of
course
that
that
is
contrary
to
a
supposed
principle
of
competitive
equality
and
of
course
that
principle
was
articulated
and
followed
by
this
court
in
the
walker
bank
case.
as
to
that,
of
course
the
walker
bank
case
involved
the
situation
where
nobody
questioned
that
what
was
involved
was
a
branch
and
that
there
was
an
incorporation
of
state
law.
the
question
there
was,
“is
all
of
the
state
law
incorporated
or
as
the
court
put
it,
only
some
of
it?”
the
comptroller
made
a
valiant
uphill
argument
that
it
was
only
the
law
relating
to
location
that
was
incorporated
and
not
the
law
relating
to
the
manner
in
which
a
branch
can
be
establish.
this
case
on
the
other
hand,
raises
the
question
whether
there
is
any
incorporation
of
state
law
at
all.
there
is
such
an
incorporation
only
if
there
is
a
branch.
we
would
submit
that
the
policy
of
“competitive
equality”
which
is
a
genuine
policy
comes
into
play
only
to
the
extent
that
there
is
in
the
act
an
incorporation
of
state
law.
it
is
not
an
all
pervading
absolute
policy
that
runs
throughout
every
provision
of
the
national
bank
act
and
of
course
there
are
great
many
things
that
national
banks
can
do
that
states
banks
cannot
do
and
there
are
a
great
many
things
that
state
banks
cannot
do
that
national
banks
can
--
state
banks
can
do
that
national
banks
cannot
do.
so,
that
we
say
that
while
“competitive
equality”
is
a
very
genuine
principle,
it
is
a
principle
that
applies
only
in
the
instances
where
congress
has
specifically
provided
for
a
reference
to
state
law.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
that
is
certain
true
mr.
justice
white
and
i'm
relying
on
my
colleague
primarily
to
convince
you
that
that
as
a
matter
of
the
federal
definition
this
act,
this
pickup
and
delivery
service
does
not
amount
to
the
conduct
of
a
branch
and
more
particularly
in
the
words
of
the
statute
does
not
amount
to
the
receipt
of
deposits
or
the
payment
of
checks.
the
effect
of
the
court
of
appeals'
notion
of
the
all
pervading
applicability
of
a
principle
of
competitive
equality
is
delegate
to
the
states
a
broad
control
over
perhaps
any
off-premise
activity
by
a
national
bank.
all
the
state
has
to
do
is
call
it
a
branch
and
then
like
calling
it
a
branch,
the
state
can
succeed
in
having
its
own
substantive
law
which
may
permit
it
or
may
prohibit
it,
incorporate
it,
purportedly
through
subsection
(c)
of
section
36.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
oh!
it
would
certainly
be
turned.
of
course
the
state
comptrollers
say
that,
“why
should
anybody
be
worried?”
the
state
comptrollers
can
prohibit
an
act
by
a
national
bank
only
if
they
are
also
willing
to
prohibit
it
by
a
state
bank.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
of
course
the
effect
of
this
is
--
first,
to
move
from
the
federal
comptroller
to
the
state
officials
or
at
least
to
the
state
legislature,
a
broad
range
of
control
over
the
incidental
services
that
a
national
bank
can
perform
off
its
premises.
this
involves
not
only
armored
car
service
of
this
type
but
involves
a
broad
range
of
activities
related
to
the
lending
of
money
which
is
another
issue
of
some
kind
of
importance
in
the
area.
potentially,
it
could
involve
things
like
a
bank
credit
card
for
example,
which
i
suppose
a
state
comptroller
could
regard
as
a
banking
activity
being
carried
on
off
the
banks
premises.
and
if
the
state
comptroller
chose
to
prohibit
it,
he
could
prohibit
it
and
under
the
fifth
circuit's
theory,
it
appears
that
that
would
mean
that
in
that
particular
state
a
national
bank
cannot
carry
on
that
kind
of
activity.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
there
is
no,
i
believe
there's
no
issue
whatever
in
this
case
mr.
justice
black
of
lending.
i
am
just
saying
that
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
of
course
the
principle
of
a
aligning
the
states
in
to
this
extent
would
permit
them
to
govern
when
to
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
certainly
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
is
no
question
of
lending.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
in
a
technical
sense
at
least
they
do
not
accept
deposits.
they
accept
money
for
deposit.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
the
deposit
taking
place
when
the
teller
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
and
they
also
deliver
funds
withdrawn
from
a
customer's
account
to
the
customer's
store.
he
can
call
in
and
say,
“would
you
please
take
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
they
do
not.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
it's
true
there
is
no
--
there
is
at
present
no
charge
to
the
customer
other
than
the
charges
of
having
the
account
at
the
bank
and
of
course
there's
the
factor
that
generally
the
people
who
use
this
are
relatively
large
customers
from
whom
of
bank
presumably
receives
relatively
large
service
charges.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
so
of
course
i'm
happy
to
answer.
so,
as
i
have
indicated
we
think
that
does
have
broad
significance,
some
of
which
has
been
indicated
in
some
detail
by
the
brief
filed
by
the
bank
of
cornelia
and
a
group
of
other
national
banks
throughout
the
country
as
amicus
curiae
in
this
case.
in
sum,
we
think
on
this
choice
of
law
issue
that
the
district
court
gave
section
36,
a
simple
straight
forward
and
sensible
reading.
the
act
provides
according
to
that
reading
which
seems
not
only
sensible,
but
the
least
complicated
approach
which
has
some
virtue
that
national
banks
can
have
branches
where
state
banks
can
have
branches,
but
as
befits
a
comprehensive
scheme
of
federal
regulation,
the
act
specifies
that
uniformed
nationwide
set
of
criteria
for
determining
what
is
a
branch
and
therefore
when
we
look
to
state
law.
i
might
just
say
a
word
by
way
of
introduction
to
mr.
edwards'
point
that
of
course
the
comptroller
in
promulgating
the
rulings
pursuant
to
which
these
activities
are
being
carried
on
made
a
determination
that
this
pickup
and
delivery
services
do
not
amount
to
branch
banking.
the
federal
reserve
board
for
its
own
purposes
which
involve
its
regulation
of
state
banks
that
are
members
of
the
federal
reserve
system
which
are
governed
by
the
same
law,
the
same
federal
law
with
respect
to
branching
has
made
exactly
the
same
determination.
we
believe
that
those
interpretations
are
first
the
only
reasonable
ones
that
can
be
given
of
the
federal
statute
assuming
we
are
treating
the
question
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
in
any
event,
we
believe
that
the
expert
interpretations
of
the
law
that
they
are
directed
to
administer
by
these
two
federal
agencies
is
entitled
to
a
certain
amount
of
deference.
if
there's
an
area
of
reasonableness
that
determination
should
be
set
aside
only
if
it
is
found
to
be
unreasonable.
therefore,
we
believe
first
that
the
question
is
before
this
court
is
one
of
federal
law
and
that
the
federal
law
was
properly
interpreted
with
respect
to
this
kind
of
situation.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
we
have
set
forth
some
of
that
on
our
reply
brief
at
page
three.
first
of
all,
the
court
starts
of
early
in
its
opinion
by
saying
that
the
controlling
issue
of
law
in
this
appeal
concerns
the
district
court's
choice
of
law.
that
is
that
court's
failure
to
consult
state
law
in
determining
whether
first
national's
activities
constitute
branch
banking.
then
it
goes
on
to
say
first
national
attempts
us
to
convince
--
attempts
to
convince
us
that
section
36
(f)
is
the
sole
and
monolithic
definer
of
branch
then
by
taking
us
through
some
level
[inaudible]
and
meandering
past
of
the
laws
of
agency
in
contract.
first
national
seeks
to
demonstrate
that
it
is
not
a
established
offices
or
agencies
whereas
specified
in
section
36
(f),
deposits
are
received
or
checks
paid
or
money
lent.
such
a
line
of
argument
is
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
the
principle
and
finally,
it's
said
towards
the
end
of
its
opinion
we
therefore
refuse
to
pass
the
twisting
pass
of
agency
in
contracts
urged
upon
us
in
this
case
and
look
instead
to
the
laws
of
florida.
i
think
as
i
have
said
that
considering
that
language
plus
the
result,
we
have
to
say
that
in
effect
the
court
of
appeals
have
said
that
the
language
of
36
(f)
is
superfluous.
it's
there,
but
it
really
doesn't
have
any
meaning
because
if
the
state
calls
it
a
branch,
then
it
is
a
branch.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
are
two
consolidated
cases
reviewing
the
same
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
ultimate
question
presented
is
whether
state
banking
authorities
can
prevent
a
national
bank
from
providing
its
customers
with
an
armored
car
messenger
service
to
and
from
the
bank,
if
they
can
do
so
on
the
theory
that
such
a
service
amounts
to
the
operation
of
a
branch
governed
by
a
state
law
under
the
national
bank
act.
section
36
(c)
of
that
act
provides
in
general
term
that
a
national
bank
may
establish
and
operate
a
branch
if
a
state
bank
similarly
situated
would
be
authorized
under
state
law
to
do
so.
florida,
where
this
case
arises
is
a
state
that
does
not
permit
branch
banking
at
all
and
it
is
further
established
for
present
purposes
at
least
that
a
florida
state
bank
would
not
be
permitted
by
the
state
authorities
to
operate
the
messenger
service
here
in
question.
i
might
say
parenthetically
the
reason
it's
established
for
present
purposes
only
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
noted
in
its
opinion
that
there
is
litigation
pending
in
a
florida
state
court
where
this
issue
had
been
raised
for
the
first
time
that
will
resolve
presumably
as
a
matter
of
state
interpretation
whether
or
not
this
kind
of
service
is
in
fact
prohibited
by
the
florida
statute.
however,
subject
to
the
outcome
of
that
litigation
which
the
florida
court
has
stayed
until
this
court
decides
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
the
interpretation
of
the
florida
state
banking
commissioner
who
was
one
of
the
respondents
here
that
the
florida
statute
would
prohibit
this
kind
of
service
subject
only
to
a
retention
of
jurisdiction
by
the
district
court
to
change
its
order.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
yes,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
fact,
it
seemed
a
little
strange
to
me
that
the
florida
court
would
stay
itself
pending
determination
of
this
case,
but
it
in
fact
until
is
done
so.
in
any
event,
nobody
knows
what
will
happen
to
that
litigation
and
unless
something
does
happen,
the
court
of
appeals
has
in
effect
decided
that
this
service
cannot
proceed.
the
issue
therefore
in
this
case
is
whether
the
kind
of
messenger
service
involved
here
is
a
branch,
being
of
course
the
term
of
order
of
the
national
bank
act.
if
it's
a
branch
then
36
(c)
of
the
national
bank
act
makes
its
legality
depend
upon
state
law
and
as
i
have
said,
state
law
for
present
purposes
forbids
it.
if
it
is
not
a
branch
then
its
legality
depends
only
upon
the
provisions
of
the
national
bank
act
relating
to
the
powers
of
national
banks
which
do
not
refer
to
state
law
and
are
not
in
issue
in
this
case.
as
we
see
it,
the
definitional
problem
that
this
case
presents
breaks
down
really
into
two
questions.
the
first
question
is
the
threshold
question
of
where
we
look
for
the
criteria
to
determine,
“what
is
a
branch?”
we
say
that
naturally
enough
one
would
look
to
subsection
(f)
of
the
branching
section
of
the
national
bank
act
section
36,
which
says
that
the
term
“branch”
is
used
in
this
section
shall
be
held
to
include
any
branch
bank,
branch
office,
branch
agency,
additional
office
or
any
branch
place
of
business
at
which
deposits
are
received
or
checks
paid
or
money
lent.
the
court
of
appeals
said
however,
that
30
--
section
36
(f)
is
hardly
adequate
as
a
definition,
those
are
the
words
that
it
used,
and
therefore
that
the
law
of
florida
should
determine
what
is
a
branch
for
purposes
of
this
incorporation
of
state
law
that's
provided
for
in
section
36
(c).
as
i've
indicated
if
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
that
in
the
case
here,
if
we're
right
there
remains
a
further
question
whether
the
district
court
properly
held
that
the
armored
car
messenger
service
in
question
here
was
not
branch
banking
as
a
matter
of
purely
federal
law
under
the
section
36
definition
which
the
district
court
treated
as
the
exclusive
definition
and
of
course
if
the
district
court
was
right,
then
florida
law
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case.
there
are
--
these
main
two
cases,
there
are
two
petitioners
here,
comptroller
of
the
currency
who
has
authorized
the
service
in
question
and
the
first
national
bank
in
plant
city,
florida,
which
is
the
bank
that's
conducting
the
service.
there
will
be
argument
on
behalf
of
each
petitioner.
in
my
argument
i
plan
to
cover
the
first
of
the
questions
that
i've
mentioned,
the
choice
of
law
question,
which
has
importance
not
only
for
this
particular
kind
of
service
but
for
a
variety
of
other
services
that
national
banks
offer
or
may
wish
to
offer.
mr.
edwards
who
will
be
arguing
on
behalf
of
the
bank
will
deal
primarily
with
the
second
question
which
assumes
that
of
course
that
if
we
prevail
on
the
first
question,
the
question
as
to
how
the
facts
of
this
particular
service
relate
to
the
federal
definition
in
section
36
(f)
if
that
is
in
fact
the
governing
definition.
that
question
of
course
also
has
great
importance
because
there
are
a
great
variety
or
a
great
number
of
national
banks
throughout
the
country
that
provides
services
or
interested
in
providing
services
of
the
general
nature
of
the
services
that
are
involved
in
plant
city.
because
of
this
division,
i
would
hope
to
limit
my
statement
of
the
case
to
a
very
brief
statement
of
how
the
case
arouse
and
the
fundamental
facts,
leaving
for
mr.
edwards
a
more
detailed
description
of
the
messenger
service
that's
involved
in
the
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
october
1966,
after
consultation
with
the
comptroller
of
the
currency's
office,
the
plant
city
national
bank
began
to
operate
its
messenger
service.
it
was
designed
for
the
benefit
of
customers
primarily
stores
in
the
outlying
areas
of
plant
city,
florida
which
is
a
city
of
about
18,000
people
some
20
miles
inland
from
tampa.
the
messenger
service
has
two
elements.
first,
an
armored
car,
which
pursues
a
daily
route
between
the
bank's
office
and
the
costumers'
places
of
business.
a
messenger
arrives
on
that
truck
and
he
receives
from
the
customer's
sealed
bags
containing
funds
for
deposit
in
the
bank
which
he
then
delivers
to
a
teller
at
the
bank's
office
who
opens
the
bags
and
then
treats
the
contents
as
deposits
when
they
are
received
at
the
bank.
the
messenger
also
delivers
to
the
customers
upon
prior
order
by
the
customers
sealed
bags
that
contains
change
or
funds
for
use
in
their
businesses
which
have
been
withdrawn
from
the
customers
accounts
before
the
truck
leaves
the
bank.
the
second
element
of
the
messenger
service
is
a
secured
receptacle,
which
is
literally
a
hole
in
the
wall
and
at
shopping
center
with
the
drop
slot
where
sealed
bags
or
envelops
containing
funds
for
deposit
in
the
bank
can
be
left
for
pickup
by
the
messenger
service
during
the
course
its
daily
rounds.
the
armored
car
operation
was
designed
to
comply
specifically
with
paragraph
7490
of
the
comptroller's
manual
for
national
banks,
which
is
a
compilation
of
pertinent
regulations
among
other
things.
that
paragraph
authorizes
such
an
operation
subject
to
the
condition
that
the
customer
understands
the
messenger
as
his
agent
and
not
the
bank's
and
that
any
funds
received
are
not
actually
deposits
until
the
teller
at
the
bank
accepts
them.
the
bank
also
obtained
with
respect
to
the
shopping
center
pickup
point
a
specific
ruling
from
the
comptroller's
office
that
that
was
permissible
subject
generally
to
the
same
conditions
that
i
mentioned.
underlying
both
rulings
of
course
was
a
determination
by
the
comptroller's
office
that
such
operations
subject
to
these
conditions
were
sound
and
safe
services
authorized
by
the
national
bank
as
incidence
to
the
conduct
of
a
banking
business
and
that
they
did
not
operate
to
the
--
amount
to
the
operation
of
a
branch
as
to
which
of
course
state
law
would
be
pertinent.
just
as
the
messenger
service
was
about
to
begin
its
operations,
the
respondent
dickinson,
who
was
the
florida
state
banking
commissioner
sent
a
letter
to
the
president
of
the
bank
and
expressing
the
view
that
the
services
would
violate
florida
law
and
threatening
suit
if
the
bank
did
not
cease
and
desist.
the
bank
promptly
began
this
suit
in
the
district
court
seeking
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction
to
prevent
such
state
interference
with
the
operation.
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
subsequently
intervened
as
a
plaintiff
and
the
respondent,
state
bank
here
also
intervened
as
defendants
on
the
side
of
the
state
commissioner.
at
the
outset
of
litigation,
the
district
court
entered
a
preliminary
injunction
allowing
messenger
service
to
continue
and
in
fact
that
preliminary
injunction
has
continued
in
effect
until
now
so
the
service
has
been
proceeding.
then
after
exploration
of
the
facts
and
affidavits
and
upon
reading
in
depth
voluminous
depositions
that
were
taken
in
the
case,
the
district
court
entered
summary
judgment
in
behalf
of
the
national
bank
and
the
comptroller.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
as
i
indicated
mr.
justice
black,
i
had
hoped
perhaps
that
mr.
edwards
in
his
portion
of
the
argument
could
describe
that
more
fully.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
will
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
as
i
indicate
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
does
not
bother
me
mr.
justice
black.
i
did
try
to
outline
the
general
language
it
operates.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
involves
an
armored
car
which
picks
up
from
customers,
generally
business
enterprises
in
the
outlying
areas
of
plant
city,
sealed
canvass
bags
containing
funds
which
they
wish
to
deposit
at
the
main
office
of
the
bank
in
downtown
plant
city.
it
receives
those,
turns
them
over
to
a
teller,
actually
two
officials
of
the
bank
at
the
office
who
then
open
the
bags,
count
the
money,
treat
the
money
as
if
it
were
then
deposited
at
the
point
when
it
reaches
the
bank.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
the
messenger
on
the
armored
car
does
do
that,
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
--
and
mr.
edwards
may
correct
me
and
i
believe
not.
i
believe
it's
only
incorporated
more
or
less
rural
areas
surrounding
this
shopping
center.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
they
are.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
it
is.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
in
the
sense
that
any
employee
would
be.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
though
of
course
the
con
--
there
are
contractual
relationships.
there's
a
specific
contract
with
each
customer
upon
whom
the
truck
calls.
there's
a
contract
in
which
the
customer
states
that
he
understands
it
that
in
fact
the
messenger
is
his
agent
not
the
banks
and
that
money
is
not
treated
as
a
deposit
until
it
is
actually
received
at
the
bank
which
of
course
has
substantial
practical
significance.
if
the
truck
were
robbed,
the
money
would
still
be
the
customer's
money
and
not
the
bank's
money.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it's
true
that
there
is
insurance
but
it
would
not
be
a
deposit
until
the
customer
for
example,
in
a
case
of
a
robbery,
obtained
recovery
from
the
insurance
company
and
then
gave
that
money
to
the
bank.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
the
bank
pays
for
the
insurance.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
he
does
not
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
understand
that
though
it's
--
i
suppose
not
strictly
part
of
the
record
though
it
has
been
contemplated
that
when
the
service
shakes
down,
and
i
don't
know
exactly
when
that
would
be
and
some
allocation
of
costs
could
be
made
then
perhaps
insurance
would
be
paid
by
the
customers,
but
it
is
true
that
there
is
now
no
charge
to
the
customers.
as
i
indicated,
the
district
court
agreed
with
what
this
--
in
substance
our
position
here
that
the
determination
whether
or
not
this
service
amounts
to
a
branch
is
one
of
purely
federal
law
in
the
application
of
the
definition
that's
set
forth
in
the
national
bank
act.
he
further
determined
that
this
service
did
not
amount
to
a
branch
that
the
comptroller
had
properly
so
determined
and
accordingly
the
service
was
allowed.
the
fifth
circuit
reversed,
taking
the
approach
that
the
question
whether
or
not
this
was
a
branch
and
therefore
whether
florida
law
would
be
incorporated
and
therefore
whether
florida
law
would
be
allowed
to
prohibit
this
service
was
a
question
of
state
law
and
that
since
florida
law
as
the
court
understood
it
regarded
this
activity
as
a
branch
therefore,
section
36
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
the
source
of
that
florida
law
as
to
what
was
a
branch,
was
ultimately
the
court
of
appeals'
notion
of
the
meaning
of
a
florida
statute,
which
in
fact
says
nothing
about
branching
or
about
branches
in
terms.
it
simply
says
any
bank
or
trust
company
shall
have
only
one
place
of
doing
business
and
skipping
a
bit
and
the
business
of
the
bank
or
trust
company
shall
be
transacted
at
its
banking
house
and
not
elsewhere.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that
is
true
mr.
justice
brennan.
there
is
a
fact
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
as
i
say
is
that
the
issue
in
a
court
and
a
case
which
is
now
on
a
--
at
a
lower
court
in
florida
which
of
course
may
work
its
way
up
through
the
system.
the
court
of
appeals
did
as
i
indicated
note
review
of
the
florida
banking
commissioner
and
did
to
be
frank
indicate
that
it
thought
that
was
a
reasonable
position,
so
it
was
not
and
an
out
reliance
simply
upon
the
ruling
of
a
florida
official.
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
leaves
us
what
seems
to
us
an
anomalous
principle
one
which
is
apparently
repudiated
in
this
court
by
the
respondents,
but
which
is
enthusiastically
supported
by
the
amicus
brief
that's
been
filed
on
behalf
of
the
national
association
of
state
bank
supervisors
who
i
understand
will
be
presenting
oral
argument
and
who
represent
all
50
of
the
state
banking
commissioners,
including
the
one
who
is
a
respondent
here.
we
believe
that
the
principle
followed
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
erroneous
and
that
it
is
one
that
would
be
highly
damaging
to
the
proper
regulation
of
the
national
bank
system.
we
think
that
a
straight
forward
reading
to
begin
with
of
section
36
of
the
national
bank
act
makes
it
quite
clear
that
section
36
is
designed
to
establish
a
uniform
and
exclusive
definition
of
what
is
a
national
bank
branch.
the
structure
of
section
36
remains
now
very
much
as
it
was
when
it
was
first
enacted
in
1927
as
section
7
of
the
mcfadden
act
which
for
the
first
time
allowed
national
banks
to
engage
in
branch
banking,
generally
speaking
on
the
same
terms
as
state
banks.
the
introductory
paragraph
of
section
36
provides
that
the
conditions
upon
which
a
national
bank
--
banking
association
may
retain
or
establish
and
operate
a
branch
or
branches
are
the
following
and
the
word
“branch”
appears
throughout
the
section
notably
in
subsection
(c)
to
which
i
have
referred,
which
says
that
“a
national
banking
association
may
with
the
approval
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
establish
and
operate
new
branches
if
such
establishment
and
operation
are
at
the
time
expressly
authorized
to
state
banks
by
the
law
of
the
state
in
question.”
now,
there
are
further
refinements
there
which
i
won't
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
acknowledge
that
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
not
entirely
clear
language
in
the
opinion.
i
think
that
the
ultimate
--
the
court's
statement
of
what
it
was
holding
and
it's
holding
in
fact
can
only
be
read
as
a
holding
that
if
state
law
regards
it's
as
a
branch,
it
is
therefore
a
branch
for
purposes
of
federal
law
and
therefore
state
substantive
law
of
branching
is
incorporated
by
section
36
(c).
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
in
fact
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
federal
law
is
hardly
adequate
as
a
definition
and
as
we
read
it,
i
have
seen
--
as
the
state
bank
supervisors
read
it,
i
believe
that
in
substance
it
does
amount
to
saying
that
if
state
law
calls
it
a
branch,
you
don't
have
to
look
at
the
federal
law.
that
seems
to
us
a
highly
anomalous
reading
of
a
subsection
of
a
federal
statute
which
says
that
the
term
“branch”
is
used
in
this
section
shall
be
held
to
include
any
branch
bank
office,
agency,
additional
office
at
which
deposits
or
receive
checks
paid
or
loans
or
money
lent.
congressman
mcfadden
who
is
of
course
the
sponsor
of
the
act
said
at
his
own
analysis
of
the
act
upon
its
passage
that
subsection
(f)
and
now
i'm
quoting
from
his
language
defines
the
term
“branch”
and
he
plays
outside
of
the
way
--
or
away
from
the
main
office
where
the
bank
carries
on
its
business
or
receiving
deposits,
paying
checks,
lending
money
or
transacting
business
at
the
main
office
is
a
branch.
and
of
course
this
question
of
“what
is
a
branch?”
is
relevant
for
a
variety
of
purposes
other
than
subsection
(c)
to
which
who
we
refer
in
our
brief,
including
sections
where
there
is
no
semblance
of
any
incorporation
of
state
law.
it
seems
unusual
that
congress
would
expect
that
these
--
that
the
definition
of
branch
for
these
purposes
would
vary
according
to
the
state
where
the
particular
national
bank
in
question
is
located
and
it
seems
even
more
anomalous
to
treat
the
word
“branch”
as
having
different
meanings
in
different
subsections
of
the
same
section
enacted
at
the
same
time.
as
we
further
detail
in
our
brief,
the
comptroller,
the
attorney
general
and
until
this
case,
the
federal
courts
have
all
treated
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
particular
enterprise
is
a
branch
as
a
question
of
federal
law
unaffected
by
local
law0
and
of
course
this
is
consistent
with
the
general
principle
that
when
congress
uses
a
word
unless
there's
some
reason
to
believe,
otherwise,
congress
intended
that
that
word
should
be
defined
and
interpreted
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
--
as
i
--
subject
to
what
i
said
before
that
that
is
true,
subject
to
a
possible
decision
of
the
contrary
by
the
florida
courts
where
the
question
as
--
but
for
present
purposes,
that
is
true.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
mr.
justice,
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
we
say
that
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it's
argued
of
course
that
that
is
contrary
to
a
supposed
principle
of
competitive
equality
and
of
course
that
principle
was
articulated
and
followed
by
this
court
in
the
walker
bank
case.
as
to
that,
of
course
the
walker
bank
case
involved
the
situation
where
nobody
questioned
that
what
was
involved
was
a
branch
and
that
there
was
an
incorporation
of
state
law.
the
question
there
was,
“is
all
of
the
state
law
incorporated
or
as
the
court
put
it,
only
some
of
it?”
the
comptroller
made
a
valiant
uphill
argument
that
it
was
only
the
law
relating
to
location
that
was
incorporated
and
not
the
law
relating
to
the
manner
in
which
a
branch
can
be
establish.
this
case
on
the
other
hand,
raises
the
question
whether
there
is
any
incorporation
of
state
law
at
all.
there
is
such
an
incorporation
only
if
there
is
a
branch.
we
would
submit
that
the
policy
of
“competitive
equality”
which
is
a
genuine
policy
comes
into
play
only
to
the
extent
that
there
is
in
the
act
an
incorporation
of
state
law.
it
is
not
an
all
pervading
absolute
policy
that
runs
throughout
every
provision
of
the
national
bank
act
and
of
course
there
are
great
many
things
that
national
banks
can
do
that
states
banks
cannot
do
and
there
are
a
great
many
things
that
state
banks
cannot
do
that
national
banks
can
--
state
banks
can
do
that
national
banks
cannot
do.
so,
that
we
say
that
while
“competitive
equality”
is
a
very
genuine
principle,
it
is
a
principle
that
applies
only
in
the
instances
where
congress
has
specifically
provided
for
a
reference
to
state
law.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
that
is
certain
true
mr.
justice
white
and
i'm
relying
on
my
colleague
primarily
to
convince
you
that
that
as
a
matter
of
the
federal
definition
this
act,
this
pickup
and
delivery
service
does
not
amount
to
the
conduct
of
a
branch
and
more
particularly
in
the
words
of
the
statute
does
not
amount
to
the
receipt
of
deposits
or
the
payment
of
checks.
the
effect
of
the
court
of
appeals'
notion
of
the
all
pervading
applicability
of
a
principle
of
competitive
equality
is
delegate
to
the
states
a
broad
control
over
perhaps
any
off-premise
activity
by
a
national
bank.
all
the
state
has
to
do
is
call
it
a
branch
and
then
like
calling
it
a
branch,
the
state
can
succeed
in
having
its
own
substantive
law
which
may
permit
it
or
may
prohibit
it,
incorporate
it,
purportedly
through
subsection
(c)
of
section
36.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
oh!
it
would
certainly
be
turned.
of
course
the
state
comptrollers
say
that,
“why
should
anybody
be
worried?”
the
state
comptrollers
can
prohibit
an
act
by
a
national
bank
only
if
they
are
also
willing
to
prohibit
it
by
a
state
bank.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
of
course
the
effect
of
this
is
--
first,
to
move
from
the
federal
comptroller
to
the
state
officials
or
at
least
to
the
state
legislature,
a
broad
range
of
control
over
the
incidental
services
that
a
national
bank
can
perform
off
its
premises.
this
involves
not
only
armored
car
service
of
this
type
but
involves
a
broad
range
of
activities
related
to
the
lending
of
money
which
is
another
issue
of
some
kind
of
importance
in
the
area.
potentially,
it
could
involve
things
like
a
bank
credit
card
for
example,
which
i
suppose
a
state
comptroller
could
regard
as
a
banking
activity
being
carried
on
off
the
banks
premises.
and
if
the
state
comptroller
chose
to
prohibit
it,
he
could
prohibit
it
and
under
the
fifth
circuit's
theory,
it
appears
that
that
would
mean
that
in
that
particular
state
a
national
bank
cannot
carry
on
that
kind
of
activity.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
there
is
no,
i
believe
there's
no
issue
whatever
in
this
case
mr.
justice
black
of
lending.
i
am
just
saying
that
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
of
course
the
principle
of
a
aligning
the
states
in
to
this
extent
would
permit
them
to
govern
when
to
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
certainly
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
is
no
question
of
lending.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
in
a
technical
sense
at
least
they
do
not
accept
deposits.
they
accept
money
for
deposit.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
the
deposit
taking
place
when
the
teller
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
and
they
also
deliver
funds
withdrawn
from
a
customer's
account
to
the
customer's
store.
he
can
call
in
and
say,
“would
you
please
take
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
they
do
not.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
it's
true
there
is
no
--
there
is
at
present
no
charge
to
the
customer
other
than
the
charges
of
having
the
account
at
the
bank
and
of
course
there's
the
factor
that
generally
the
people
who
use
this
are
relatively
large
customers
from
whom
of
bank
presumably
receives
relatively
large
service
charges.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
so
of
course
i'm
happy
to
answer.
so,
as
i
have
indicated
we
think
that
does
have
broad
significance,
some
of
which
has
been
indicated
in
some
detail
by
the
brief
filed
by
the
bank
of
cornelia
and
a
group
of
other
national
banks
throughout
the
country
as
amicus
curiae
in
this
case.
in
sum,
we
think
on
this
choice
of
law
issue
that
the
district
court
gave
section
36,
a
simple
straight
forward
and
sensible
reading.
the
act
provides
according
to
that
reading
which
seems
not
only
sensible,
but
the
least
complicated
approach
which
has
some
virtue
that
national
banks
can
have
branches
where
state
banks
can
have
branches,
but
as
befits
a
comprehensive
scheme
of
federal
regulation,
the
act
specifies
that
uniformed
nationwide
set
of
criteria
for
determining
what
is
a
branch
and
therefore
when
we
look
to
state
law.
i
might
just
say
a
word
by
way
of
introduction
to
mr.
edwards'
point
that
of
course
the
comptroller
in
promulgating
the
rulings
pursuant
to
which
these
activities
are
being
carried
on
made
a
determination
that
this
pickup
and
delivery
services
do
not
amount
to
branch
banking.
the
federal
reserve
board
for
its
own
purposes
which
involve
its
regulation
of
state
banks
that
are
members
of
the
federal
reserve
system
which
are
governed
by
the
same
law,
the
same
federal
law
with
respect
to
branching
has
made
exactly
the
same
determination.
we
believe
that
those
interpretations
are
first
the
only
reasonable
ones
that
can
be
given
of
the
federal
statute
assuming
we
are
treating
the
question
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
in
any
event,
we
believe
that
the
expert
interpretations
of
the
law
that
they
are
directed
to
administer
by
these
two
federal
agencies
is
entitled
to
a
certain
amount
of
deference.
if
there's
an
area
of
reasonableness
that
determination
should
be
set
aside
only
if
it
is
found
to
be
unreasonable.
therefore,
we
believe
first
that
the
question
is
before
this
court
is
one
of
federal
law
and
that
the
federal
law
was
properly
interpreted
with
respect
to
this
kind
of
situation.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
we
have
set
forth
some
of
that
on
our
reply
brief
at
page
three.
first
of
all,
the
court
starts
of
early
in
its
opinion
by
saying
that
the
controlling
issue
of
law
in
this
appeal
concerns
the
district
court's
choice
of
law.
that
is
that
court's
failure
to
consult
state
law
in
determining
whether
first
national's
activities
constitute
branch
banking.
then
it
goes
on
to
say
first
national
attempts
us
to
convince
--
attempts
to
convince
us
that
section
36
(f)
is
the
sole
and
monolithic
definer
of
branch
then
by
taking
us
through
some
level
[inaudible]
and
meandering
past
of
the
laws
of
agency
in
contract.
first
national
seeks
to
demonstrate
that
it
is
not
a
established
offices
or
agencies
whereas
specified
in
section
36
(f),
deposits
are
received
or
checks
paid
or
money
lent.
such
a
line
of
argument
is
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
the
principle
and
finally,
it's
said
towards
the
end
of
its
opinion
we
therefore
refuse
to
pass
the
twisting
pass
of
agency
in
contracts
urged
upon
us
in
this
case
and
look
instead
to
the
laws
of
florida.
i
think
as
i
have
said
that
considering
that
language
plus
the
result,
we
have
to
say
that
in
effect
the
court
of
appeals
have
said
that
the
language
of
36
(f)
is
superfluous.
it's
there,
but
it
really
doesn't
have
any
meaning
because
if
the
state
calls
it
a
branch,
then
it
is
a
branch.
