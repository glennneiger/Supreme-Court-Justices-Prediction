mr.
james
f.
bell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
50
officials
of
the
state
government
responsible
for
the
supervision
and
regulation
of
the
6,400
state
chartered
banks
of
the
country
have
filed
in
a
brief
as
an
amicus
curiae
with
this
court
urging
affirmation
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
because
both
our
position
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
had
been
characterized
in
a
manner
by
the
petitioners
with
which
we
do
not
agree,
i
would
like
at
the
outset
of
my
argument
to
pose
the
issue
as
we
see
it
and
its
resolution
by
the
court
of
appeals
below.
now,
the
petitioners
argued
that
the
determination
of
what
off-premise
business
activities
of
a
national
bank
amount
to
a
branch
is
governed
exclusively
by
36
(f).
and
they
contend
that
all
that
is
involved
in
a
case
of
this
type
a
technical
analysis
of
the
understanding
between
the
bank
and
the
customer
in
the
light
of
applicable
agency
contract
of
commercial
law
to
determine
whether
there's
been
a
loan,
deposit
or
check
transaction
away
from
the
bank's
business.
now,
if
there
has
been
no
transaction,
there's
no
branch
and
no
reference
to
state
law
is
required
or
permitted
in
this
analytical
process.
now,
under
this
reasoning,
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
has
recently
ruled
that
national
banks
are
not
branching
when
they
engage
in
the
check
cashing
or
deposit
making
process
through
off-premise
shopping
center
depositories
or
mobile
facilities
or
when
they
engage
in
a
loan
making
process
through
off-premise
loan
production
offices.
now,
if
the
result
is
to
--
is
a
competitive
disadvantage
for
state
banks
who
have
prohibited
such
activity
by
state
branch
policy
embedded
in
state
law,
the
petitioners
assert
that
this
is
precisely
what
congress
intended.
now,
the
construction
of
section
36
(f)
which
we
support,
which
is
the
principal
argument
presented
by
the
respondents
and
which
is
the
one
reflected
in
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
this,
the
court
of
appeals
started
with
this
court's
decision
in
the
walker
bank
case
and
there
this
court
has
exhaustively
studied
the
legislative
history
of
the
branching
provisions
of
the
mcfadden
act
of
1927
and
the
banking
act
of
1933
and
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
dominant
intent
of
congress
was
to
establish
competitive
equality
between
national
and
state
banks
in
the
matter
of
branching
based
on
state
law.
and
the
court
then
concluded
that
the
only
way
to
reconcile
section
36
(f),
the
definitional
section
and
section
36
(c),
the
branching
section
within
the
framework
of
this
congressional
intent,
was
to
consider
section
36
(f)
as
a
functional
definition.
if
there
is
an
off-premise
facility
at
which
activities
are
performed,
essential
to
the
loan,
deposit
or
check
paying
process,
then
reference
must
be
made
to
state
branching
policy
in
a
state
law
to
determine
if
the
off-premise
activity
would
be
a
branch.
now,
in
other
words,
the
court
of
appeals
considered
section
36
as
a
substantive
definition
of
essential
banking
functions
not
as
a
technical
delineation
of
the
party's
rights.
for
the
whole
controversy
in
the
mcfadden
act
of
1927
when
both
section
36
(c)
and
(f)
were
adopted
and
later
in
the
banking
act
of
1933,
revolved
around
the
dispute
between
unit
banking
and
branch
banking.
and
in
the
real
world
of
banking,
the
resolution
of
that
dispute
is
not
made
by
a
contractual
relationship
described
in
small
print
on
a
transmittal
slip.
it
is
made
by
a
determination
of
the
extent
to
which
banks
can
compete
off-premises
in
the
functional
essentials
of
banking,
loans,
deposits
and
checks.
now,
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
and
there
is
no
conflict
or
obscurity
about
it.
it
said
that
if
no
matter
how
you
look
at
it,
unless
you
want
to
throw
away
all
the
concepts
of
the
functional
business
of
banking,
the
off-premise
activities
in
the
case,
in
this
case,
inaugurated
by
the
petitioners
below
involved
a
deposit-making
process
and
a
similar
determination
had
been
made
by
the
state
chartered
banks
case
court
and
so
they
turned
to
state
law
and
found
that
off-premise
activity
would
be
prohibited.
state
banks
under
the
branching
policy
of
the
state
as
reflected
in
its
state
branch
statutes
and
they
therefore
concluded,
it
would
be
unlawful
for
national
banks
and
that
is
the
decision
which
we
too
seek.
mr.
james
f.
bell
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
there's
no
argument
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
could
have
given
national
banks
this
authority.
the
question
is
one
of
statutory
construction
did
it.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn,
if
i
may,
at
this
point
to
some
of
the
lines
of
arguments
advanced
by
the
petitioners
against
this
position.
the
first
one,
i
think
frankly
it
is
directed
to
the
wrong
forum,
to
the
courts
rather
than
to
the
congress,
but
basically
it's
this.
imaginative
and
vigorous
national
banks
are
developing
modern
concepts
of
banking
which
would
be
frustrated
under
the
ruling
of
the
court
below
because
it
would
subject
national
banks
to
unfriendly
state
legislation
construed
by
unfriendly
state
banking
departments
and
would
result
in
a
disparity
of
treatment
of
national
banks
by
the
various
states.
this
line
of
argument
errs
on
at
least
six
accounts.
first,
there
is
a
disparity
of
treatment
of
national
banks
by
the
various
states
in
the
matter
of
branching
today.
12
permit
unlimited
branching,
15
prohibited
altogether
and
the
remaining
23
adopt
a
middle
ground
with
widely
varying
restrictions
offering
some
of
the
benefits
of
banking,
but
trying
to
protect
small
country
banks,
for
example,
by
expansion
of
city
banks.
so,
diversity
was
specifically
intended
by
congress
when
it
rejected
the
concept
that
branching
should
be
determined
by
federal
law.
so,
the
very
diversity
that
the
petitioners
decry
is
what
congress
wanted
because
in
every
state,
there
are
differing
economies
as
well
as
divergent
issues
on
the
issue
of
branch
versus
unit
banking
and
congress
sought
to
adopt
that
standard
as
a
measure
of
off-premise
or
branching
activities
of
banks.
second,
with
regard
to
this
high
qualification
of
unfriendly
state
legislation,
the
idea
that
a
state
is
a
going
to
pass
branching
legislation
designed
to
hurt
national
banks,
when
that
legislation
is
equally
applicable
to
state
banks,
is
simply
totally
unsupportable.
and
when
petitioners
make
this
assertion,
all
they
are
doing
as
opponents
of
unit
banking
are
saying
they
don't
like
any
restrictions
of
branching,
but
that
is
a
matter
which
congress
has
decided
the
state
should
decide.
now,
somehow,
the
third,
the
concept
that
imaginative
national
banks
are
trying
to
keep
up
with
the
times
and
are
being
rewarded
is
deserving
of
the
same
answer.
for
what
may
be
imaginative
expansion
to
some
may
spell
a
break
down
in
unit
banking
and
banking
concentration
to
others.
mr.
hanson
has
filed
a
brief
for
the
independent
banker's
association
making
this
point
very
strongly.
now,
there
are
states
which
permit
precisely
the
type
of
activity
for
which
petitioners
argue
here,
california
for
example.
but
those
states
with
a
strong
policy
favoring
unit
banking
such
as
florida
do
not
and
there
are
arguments
on
both
sides
of
this
issue.
congress
has
said
state
legislatures
should
be
the
forum
and
national
banks
as
well
as
state
banks
can
go
into
a
state
legislature
anytime
they
want
to,
to
change
the
policy
of
their
state.
fourth,
the
concept
that
the
decision
below
somehow
rather
places
national
banks
at
the
mercy
of
supervisors
or
indeed
as
the
comptroller
posed
the
question
this
morning
that
state
banks
supervisors
can
prevent
something,
we
believe
is
totally
unwarranted.
the
source
of
state
law
is
not
supervisor
imagination
but
the
statutes
of
a
state
reflecting
its
branch
banking
policies.
now,
this
whole
field
of
off-premise
activity
is
relatively
new
today.
so,
there
are
not
many
state
judicial
decisions
and
as
each
instance
arises,
the
questions
comes
up
is
this
in
accord
with
or
contrary
to
the
branching
policy
of
the
state.
and
in
the
absence
of
judicial
decisions,
supervisors
usually
seeking
the
advice
of
the
state
attorney's
general
have
been
called
upon
to
construe
the
statute.
now,
each
ruling
is
non-discriminatory,
equally
applicable
to
both
state
and
national
banks.
each
ruling
is
subject
to
judicial
review
for
its
correctness
and
indeed
as
has
been
pointed
out
here,
the
ruling
of
the
supervisor
of
florida
itself
is
now
before
florida
courts
for
decision.
now
fifth,
the
argument
of
the
comptroller
that
somehow
the
result
of
the
decision
below
is
tantamount
to
supervisor
approval
of
comptroller
decisions
is
equally
without
merit.
of
course,
the
comptroller
doesn't
have
to
seek
supervisor
approval
of
his
decisions,
but
since
congress
has
provided
a
statutory
framework
with
an
intermeshing
of
federal
and
state
law
relating
to
branching,
surely
that
doesn't
mean
that
an
iron
curtain
has
to
descend
between
the
comptroller's
office
and
the
state
supervisors.
consultation
as
to
the
meaning
of
state
law
is
not
tantamount
to
supervisor
approval
of
the
decisions
of
the
comptroller.
and
indeed,
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
wayne,
oakland
bank
case
has
held
that
this
intermeshing
demonstrates
that
congress
intended
consultation
and
cooperation
between
the
two
agencies.
now,
also
and
finally,
the
petitioners
in
their
supporting
amici
have
compiled
a
fearsome
list
of
activities
which
they
assert
that
state
supervisors
can
strike
down
under
the
decision
of
the
court
below
on
the
guise
of
their
branches
forbidden
under
state
law.
now,
the
functional
definition
of
section
36
(f)
does
not
go
to
all
banking
activities,
it
goes
to
the
essentials
of
banking
activities
relating
to
loan,
deposits,
and
checks
and
therefore,
such
activities
assigning
a
trust
agreement
in
a
law
firm's
office
and
turning
that
law
firm's
office
into
a
branch
clearly
wouldn't
even
pass
the
functional
definition.
banking
by
mail,
new
business
solicitation
clearly
doesn't
have
off-premise
additional
office
or
facility.
so,
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
that
a
loan,
check,
or
deposit
function
of
a
type
where
there
is
a
competition
with
other
banks
in
the
--
for
the
public
for
the
banking
business.
because
that's
what
the
preservation
of
the
unit
banking
system
and
those
states
that
have
adopted
depends
upon.
when
you
go
out
and
set
up
a
facility
such
as
the
set
up
in
this
case
and
get
a
million
dollars
worth
of
deposits
in
a
week,
it
is
darn
competitive
facility
and
this
is
what
the
court
--
this
is
what
the
congress
was
talking
about
when
it
was
talking
about
giving
the
states
the
right
to
determine
whether
or
not
you
are
going
to
have
a
unit
or
a
branch
banking
system.
if
you
really
follow
the
comptroller's
argument
to
its
ultimate
decision,
what
he
is
saying
is
that
anything
that
goes
on
in
a
main
banking
office
can
go
on
anywhere
else
as
long
as
you
surround
it
with
the
whole
bunch
of
agency
contracts
or
other
types
of
contractual
relationships
so
that
the
ultimate
responsibility
or
the
technical
completion
of
a
loan,
check
or
deposit
process
doesn't
take
place
until
you
have
gotten
back
to
the
main
banking
office.
and
if
national
banks
can
go
into
a
shopping
center
and
set
up
a
loan
production
office
here
and
right
next
door,
a
depository
with
a
desk,
etcetera
and
right
to
next
to
that,
a
whole
series
of
customers
where
you
can
pick
up
checks
and
cash
by
mobile
deposits,
i
ask
the
question,
who
needs
a
branch?
obviously,
--
mr.
james
f.
bell
well,
the
armored
car
service
--
mr.
james
f.
bell
no
sir.
in
my
opinion,
they
are
--
both
involve
essential
elements
relating
to
the
deposit
--
make
deposits.
mr.
james
f.
bell
i
think
that's
--
mr.
james
f.
bell
it's
an
additional
--
mr.
james
f.
bell
it
is
a
place
of
business,
i
would
suggest,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
james
f.
bell
it
is
a
branch,
place
of
business
--
mr.
james
f.
bell
--
at
which
essential
activities
relating
to
the
deposit
making
process
are
going
on
because
i
do
not
see
how
you
construe,
can
construe
section
36
(f)
in
any
other
way
and
still
reconcile
it
with
the
basic
competitive
equality
of
congress.
mr.
james
f.
bell
no
sir.
i
think
that
if
you're
talking
about
new
business
solicitation
--
mr.
james
f.
bell
yes
sir.
i
think
that
there
always
are
going
to
be
gray
areas
in
any
operation
of
this
type
but
i
think
if
you
look
at
section
36
(f)
within
the
framework
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
achieve,
competitive
equality
with
regard
to
the
banking
business
and
locations
of
the
banking
business
that
the
construction
of
the
court
below
was
the
correct
one
which
was
to
refer
to
the
state
grants
policy
as
reflected
in
state
statutes.
now,
you're
asking
me
a
whole
series
of
hypotheticals
under
the
state
law.
mr.
james
f.
bell
yes
sir.
i
think
the
deposit
--
mr.
james
f.
bell
the
depository
and
the
armored
car
service
are
essential
elements
relating
to
the
depository
--
mr.
james
f.
bell
they
are
together
in
the
sense
of
the
--
mr.
james
f.
bell
no
sir.
i
think
that
if
you
can
--
if
the
--
that
if
you
can
go
out
and
serve
your
comp
--
your
customers
in
a
20-mile
area
of
your
bank,
to
say
that
you
are
operating
solely
within
the
framework
of
your
main
banking
business
is
simply
impossible
within
the
framework
of
branch
policy
definition.
mr.
james
f.
bell
if
it
was
going
out
to
pick
up
deposits
from
a
customer's
place
of
business.
mr.
james
f.
bell
yes
sir,
clearly,
because
you
could
not
compete,
where
the
bank
that
didn't
have
that
authority,
if
you
couldn't
do
the
same
thing.
mr.
james
f.
bell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
50
officials
of
the
state
government
responsible
for
the
supervision
and
regulation
of
the
6,400
state
chartered
banks
of
the
country
have
filed
in
a
brief
as
an
amicus
curiae
with
this
court
urging
affirmation
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
because
both
our
position
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
had
been
characterized
in
a
manner
by
the
petitioners
with
which
we
do
not
agree,
i
would
like
at
the
outset
of
my
argument
to
pose
the
issue
as
we
see
it
and
its
resolution
by
the
court
of
appeals
below.
now,
the
petitioners
argued
that
the
determination
of
what
off-premise
business
activities
of
a
national
bank
amount
to
a
branch
is
governed
exclusively
by
36
(f).
and
they
contend
that
all
that
is
involved
in
a
case
of
this
type
a
technical
analysis
of
the
understanding
between
the
bank
and
the
customer
in
the
light
of
applicable
agency
contract
of
commercial
law
to
determine
whether
there's
been
a
loan,
deposit
or
check
transaction
away
from
the
bank's
business.
now,
if
there
has
been
no
transaction,
there's
no
branch
and
no
reference
to
state
law
is
required
or
permitted
in
this
analytical
process.
now,
under
this
reasoning,
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
has
recently
ruled
that
national
banks
are
not
branching
when
they
engage
in
the
check
cashing
or
deposit
making
process
through
off-premise
shopping
center
depositories
or
mobile
facilities
or
when
they
engage
in
a
loan
making
process
through
off-premise
loan
production
offices.
now,
if
the
result
is
to
--
is
a
competitive
disadvantage
for
state
banks
who
have
prohibited
such
activity
by
state
branch
policy
embedded
in
state
law,
the
petitioners
assert
that
this
is
precisely
what
congress
intended.
now,
the
construction
of
section
36
(f)
which
we
support,
which
is
the
principal
argument
presented
by
the
respondents
and
which
is
the
one
reflected
in
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
this,
the
court
of
appeals
started
with
this
court's
decision
in
the
walker
bank
case
and
there
this
court
has
exhaustively
studied
the
legislative
history
of
the
branching
provisions
of
the
mcfadden
act
of
1927
and
the
banking
act
of
1933
and
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
dominant
intent
of
congress
was
to
establish
competitive
equality
between
national
and
state
banks
in
the
matter
of
branching
based
on
state
law.
and
the
court
then
concluded
that
the
only
way
to
reconcile
section
36
(f),
the
definitional
section
and
section
36
(c),
the
branching
section
within
the
framework
of
this
congressional
intent,
was
to
consider
section
36
(f)
as
a
functional
definition.
if
there
is
an
off-premise
facility
at
which
activities
are
performed,
essential
to
the
loan,
deposit
or
check
paying
process,
then
reference
must
be
made
to
state
branching
policy
in
a
state
law
to
determine
if
the
off-premise
activity
would
be
a
branch.
now,
in
other
words,
the
court
of
appeals
considered
section
36
as
a
substantive
definition
of
essential
banking
functions
not
as
a
technical
delineation
of
the
party's
rights.
for
the
whole
controversy
in
the
mcfadden
act
of
1927
when
both
section
36
(c)
and
(f)
were
adopted
and
later
in
the
banking
act
of
1933,
revolved
around
the
dispute
between
unit
banking
and
branch
banking.
and
in
the
real
world
of
banking,
the
resolution
of
that
dispute
is
not
made
by
a
contractual
relationship
described
in
small
print
on
a
transmittal
slip.
it
is
made
by
a
determination
of
the
extent
to
which
banks
can
compete
off-premises
in
the
functional
essentials
of
banking,
loans,
deposits
and
checks.
now,
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
and
there
is
no
conflict
or
obscurity
about
it.
it
said
that
if
no
matter
how
you
look
at
it,
unless
you
want
to
throw
away
all
the
concepts
of
the
functional
business
of
banking,
the
off-premise
activities
in
the
case,
in
this
case,
inaugurated
by
the
petitioners
below
involved
a
deposit-making
process
and
a
similar
determination
had
been
made
by
the
state
chartered
banks
case
court
and
so
they
turned
to
state
law
and
found
that
off-premise
activity
would
be
prohibited.
state
banks
under
the
branching
policy
of
the
state
as
reflected
in
its
state
branch
statutes
and
they
therefore
concluded,
it
would
be
unlawful
for
national
banks
and
that
is
the
decision
which
we
too
seek.
mr.
james
f.
bell
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
there's
no
argument
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
could
have
given
national
banks
this
authority.
the
question
is
one
of
statutory
construction
did
it.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn,
if
i
may,
at
this
point
to
some
of
the
lines
of
arguments
advanced
by
the
petitioners
against
this
position.
the
first
one,
i
think
frankly
it
is
directed
to
the
wrong
forum,
to
the
courts
rather
than
to
the
congress,
but
basically
it's
this.
imaginative
and
vigorous
national
banks
are
developing
modern
concepts
of
banking
which
would
be
frustrated
under
the
ruling
of
the
court
below
because
it
would
subject
national
banks
to
unfriendly
state
legislation
construed
by
unfriendly
state
banking
departments
and
would
result
in
a
disparity
of
treatment
of
national
banks
by
the
various
states.
this
line
of
argument
errs
on
at
least
six
accounts.
first,
there
is
a
disparity
of
treatment
of
national
banks
by
the
various
states
in
the
matter
of
branching
today.
12
permit
unlimited
branching,
15
prohibited
altogether
and
the
remaining
23
adopt
a
middle
ground
with
widely
varying
restrictions
offering
some
of
the
benefits
of
banking,
but
trying
to
protect
small
country
banks,
for
example,
by
expansion
of
city
banks.
so,
diversity
was
specifically
intended
by
congress
when
it
rejected
the
concept
that
branching
should
be
determined
by
federal
law.
so,
the
very
diversity
that
the
petitioners
decry
is
what
congress
wanted
because
in
every
state,
there
are
differing
economies
as
well
as
divergent
issues
on
the
issue
of
branch
versus
unit
banking
and
congress
sought
to
adopt
that
standard
as
a
measure
of
off-premise
or
branching
activities
of
banks.
second,
with
regard
to
this
high
qualification
of
unfriendly
state
legislation,
the
idea
that
a
state
is
a
going
to
pass
branching
legislation
designed
to
hurt
national
banks,
when
that
legislation
is
equally
applicable
to
state
banks,
is
simply
totally
unsupportable.
and
when
petitioners
make
this
assertion,
all
they
are
doing
as
opponents
of
unit
banking
are
saying
they
don't
like
any
restrictions
of
branching,
but
that
is
a
matter
which
congress
has
decided
the
state
should
decide.
now,
somehow,
the
third,
the
concept
that
imaginative
national
banks
are
trying
to
keep
up
with
the
times
and
are
being
rewarded
is
deserving
of
the
same
answer.
for
what
may
be
imaginative
expansion
to
some
may
spell
a
break
down
in
unit
banking
and
banking
concentration
to
others.
mr.
hanson
has
filed
a
brief
for
the
independent
banker's
association
making
this
point
very
strongly.
now,
there
are
states
which
permit
precisely
the
type
of
activity
for
which
petitioners
argue
here,
california
for
example.
but
those
states
with
a
strong
policy
favoring
unit
banking
such
as
florida
do
not
and
there
are
arguments
on
both
sides
of
this
issue.
congress
has
said
state
legislatures
should
be
the
forum
and
national
banks
as
well
as
state
banks
can
go
into
a
state
legislature
anytime
they
want
to,
to
change
the
policy
of
their
state.
fourth,
the
concept
that
the
decision
below
somehow
rather
places
national
banks
at
the
mercy
of
supervisors
or
indeed
as
the
comptroller
posed
the
question
this
morning
that
state
banks
supervisors
can
prevent
something,
we
believe
is
totally
unwarranted.
the
source
of
state
law
is
not
supervisor
imagination
but
the
statutes
of
a
state
reflecting
its
branch
banking
policies.
now,
this
whole
field
of
off-premise
activity
is
relatively
new
today.
so,
there
are
not
many
state
judicial
decisions
and
as
each
instance
arises,
the
questions
comes
up
is
this
in
accord
with
or
contrary
to
the
branching
policy
of
the
state.
and
in
the
absence
of
judicial
decisions,
supervisors
usually
seeking
the
advice
of
the
state
attorney's
general
have
been
called
upon
to
construe
the
statute.
now,
each
ruling
is
non-discriminatory,
equally
applicable
to
both
state
and
national
banks.
each
ruling
is
subject
to
judicial
review
for
its
correctness
and
indeed
as
has
been
pointed
out
here,
the
ruling
of
the
supervisor
of
florida
itself
is
now
before
florida
courts
for
decision.
now
fifth,
the
argument
of
the
comptroller
that
somehow
the
result
of
the
decision
below
is
tantamount
to
supervisor
approval
of
comptroller
decisions
is
equally
without
merit.
of
course,
the
comptroller
doesn't
have
to
seek
supervisor
approval
of
his
decisions,
but
since
congress
has
provided
a
statutory
framework
with
an
intermeshing
of
federal
and
state
law
relating
to
branching,
surely
that
doesn't
mean
that
an
iron
curtain
has
to
descend
between
the
comptroller's
office
and
the
state
supervisors.
consultation
as
to
the
meaning
of
state
law
is
not
tantamount
to
supervisor
approval
of
the
decisions
of
the
comptroller.
and
indeed,
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
wayne,
oakland
bank
case
has
held
that
this
intermeshing
demonstrates
that
congress
intended
consultation
and
cooperation
between
the
two
agencies.
now,
also
and
finally,
the
petitioners
in
their
supporting
amici
have
compiled
a
fearsome
list
of
activities
which
they
assert
that
state
supervisors
can
strike
down
under
the
decision
of
the
court
below
on
the
guise
of
their
branches
forbidden
under
state
law.
now,
the
functional
definition
of
section
36
(f)
does
not
go
to
all
banking
activities,
it
goes
to
the
essentials
of
banking
activities
relating
to
loan,
deposits,
and
checks
and
therefore,
such
activities
assigning
a
trust
agreement
in
a
law
firm's
office
and
turning
that
law
firm's
office
into
a
branch
clearly
wouldn't
even
pass
the
functional
definition.
banking
by
mail,
new
business
solicitation
clearly
doesn't
have
off-premise
additional
office
or
facility.
so,
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
that
a
loan,
check,
or
deposit
function
of
a
type
where
there
is
a
competition
with
other
banks
in
the
--
for
the
public
for
the
banking
business.
because
that's
what
the
preservation
of
the
unit
banking
system
and
those
states
that
have
adopted
depends
upon.
when
you
go
out
and
set
up
a
facility
such
as
the
set
up
in
this
case
and
get
a
million
dollars
worth
of
deposits
in
a
week,
it
is
darn
competitive
facility
and
this
is
what
the
court
--
this
is
what
the
congress
was
talking
about
when
it
was
talking
about
giving
the
states
the
right
to
determine
whether
or
not
you
are
going
to
have
a
unit
or
a
branch
banking
system.
if
you
really
follow
the
comptroller's
argument
to
its
ultimate
decision,
what
he
is
saying
is
that
anything
that
goes
on
in
a
main
banking
office
can
go
on
anywhere
else
as
long
as
you
surround
it
with
the
whole
bunch
of
agency
contracts
or
other
types
of
contractual
relationships
so
that
the
ultimate
responsibility
or
the
technical
completion
of
a
loan,
check
or
deposit
process
doesn't
take
place
until
you
have
gotten
back
to
the
main
banking
office.
and
if
national
banks
can
go
into
a
shopping
center
and
set
up
a
loan
production
office
here
and
right
next
door,
a
depository
with
a
desk,
etcetera
and
right
to
next
to
that,
a
whole
series
of
customers
where
you
can
pick
up
checks
and
cash
by
mobile
deposits,
i
ask
the
question,
who
needs
a
branch?
obviously,
--
mr.
james
f.
bell
well,
the
armored
car
service
--
mr.
james
f.
bell
no
sir.
in
my
opinion,
they
are
--
both
involve
essential
elements
relating
to
the
deposit
--
make
deposits.
mr.
james
f.
bell
i
think
that's
--
mr.
james
f.
bell
it's
an
additional
--
mr.
james
f.
bell
it
is
a
place
of
business,
i
would
suggest,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
james
f.
bell
it
is
a
branch,
place
of
business
--
mr.
james
f.
bell
--
at
which
essential
activities
relating
to
the
deposit
making
process
are
going
on
because
i
do
not
see
how
you
construe,
can
construe
section
36
(f)
in
any
other
way
and
still
reconcile
it
with
the
basic
competitive
equality
of
congress.
mr.
james
f.
bell
no
sir.
i
think
that
if
you're
talking
about
new
business
solicitation
--
mr.
james
f.
bell
yes
sir.
i
think
that
there
always
are
going
to
be
gray
areas
in
any
operation
of
this
type
but
i
think
if
you
look
at
section
36
(f)
within
the
framework
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
achieve,
competitive
equality
with
regard
to
the
banking
business
and
locations
of
the
banking
business
that
the
construction
of
the
court
below
was
the
correct
one
which
was
to
refer
to
the
state
grants
policy
as
reflected
in
state
statutes.
now,
you're
asking
me
a
whole
series
of
hypotheticals
under
the
state
law.
mr.
james
f.
bell
yes
sir.
i
think
the
deposit
--
mr.
james
f.
bell
the
depository
and
the
armored
car
service
are
essential
elements
relating
to
the
depository
--
mr.
james
f.
bell
they
are
together
in
the
sense
of
the
--
mr.
james
f.
bell
no
sir.
i
think
that
if
you
can
--
if
the
--
that
if
you
can
go
out
and
serve
your
comp
--
your
customers
in
a
20-mile
area
of
your
bank,
to
say
that
you
are
operating
solely
within
the
framework
of
your
main
banking
business
is
simply
impossible
within
the
framework
of
branch
policy
definition.
mr.
james
f.
bell
if
it
was
going
out
to
pick
up
deposits
from
a
customer's
place
of
business.
mr.
james
f.
bell
yes
sir,
clearly,
because
you
could
not
compete,
where
the
bank
that
didn't
have
that
authority,
if
you
couldn't
do
the
same
thing.
