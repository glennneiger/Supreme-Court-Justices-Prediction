mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
although
defendants
below
supports
the
rights
of
the
appellants
to
obtain
judicial
review
of
the
commission's
decision
permitting
discontinuance
of
the
trains
involved
in
this
case.
we
do
so
for
two
legal
reasons.
first,
that
under
the
criteria
applicable
to
review
of
administrative
actions,
as
incorporated
in
the
administrative
procedure
act
the
commission's
decisions
in
these
cases
represent
agency
action
which
is
reviewable.
and
second,
nothing
in
the
history
of
the
statute
or
in
its
text
indicates
a
congressional
intent
to
foreclose
judicial
review
that
would
otherwise
be
available.
now
the
commission's
decision
in
these
two
cases
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
congress
did
intend
to
put
this
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
decision
to
investigate
it
all
rest
on
a
slightly
different
basis.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
within
the
discretion
of
the
agency.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
and
is
non-reviewable.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
we
agree
with
the
new
jersey
case.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
once
an
investigation
is
under
your
can't
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
now
let
me
turn
to
that
order
because
i
think
that's
really
the
heart
of
our
problem
here.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that's
right.
if
your
honors
will
look
in
the
record
at
page
41
and
at
page
67,
you'll
see
the
two
basic
orders
that
the
commission
entered
here.
now
those
orders
were
entered
after
a
full
hearing.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
67,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
those
orders
were
entered
after
a
full
hearing
on
the
merits.
incidentally
that
is
the
only
kind
of
investigation
the
commission
can
give
in
this
county
under
13
(a)
(1)
if
it
is
going
to
have
power
to
order
the
railroad
to
continue
the
train.
it
cannot
order
the
railroad
to
continue
the
train
without
conducting
a
hearing.
so
once
it
opens
an
investigation,
there
has
to
be
a
full
hearing.
now
what
it
does
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
oh!
it
is
a
conceivable
railroad
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
commission
â€“
it
is
conceivable
the
commission
might
find
that
it
opened
its
investigation
improvidently.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
but
in
this
situation
and
in
most
situations
it
goes
all
the
way
through
with
the
full
administrative
hearing
in
which
it
applies
the
substantive
standard
of
section
13
(a)
(1).
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
what
they
do
as
the
orders
reflect
at
pages
41
and
67,
is
make
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
which
are
incorporated
into
the
commission's
order.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
judicial
remedy
for?
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
to
set
aside
the
commission's
order
and
to
ban
the
case
to
the
commission
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--
and
in
effect
to
be
discontinuing
those
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
commission
would
have
to
reopen
the
matter
and
to
make
a
redetermination
looking
toward
a
direction
to
the
railroad
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
renew
the
investigation
and
--
cause
if
the
court
sets
aside
the
commission's
decision.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
but
the
discontinuance
if
i
can
get
back
to
these
two
orders,
the
discontinuance
is
based
upon
the
commission's
findings
of
fact
that
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
and
those
findings
in
fact
apply
to
substantive
standards
of
the
act.
those
substantive
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
exactly
what
would
happen.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
would
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
remand.
presumably
if
the
commission
was
found
that
there
was
no
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
decision
or
apply
the
wrong
legal
standard,
then
the
railroad
would
have
to
--
the
commission
would
have
to
direct
the
railroad
to
continue
the
train
in
effect
for
another
year
which
is
what
the
statute
would
provide.
so
that
what
we've
got
is
an
order
here
which
does
more
than
just
discontinue
the
investigation.
it
makes
a
substantive
determination.
and
that
substantive
determination
has
a
substantial
impact
on
the
communities
affected
and
because
of
that
impact
it
amounts
to
a
reviewable
order.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
correct.
what
the
commission
has
to
decide
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well
in
determining
whether
they
should
be
investigation
of
course,
they
have
to
consider
the
standards
of
the
act.
but
there's
more
to
it.
when
an
agency
is
going
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
investigate
something,
not
only
is
it
considering
the
substantive
standards
involved,
it
also
has
to
make
other
to
take
into
account
other
considerations,
its
resources,
the
situation,
the
importance
of
the
termination
to
the
area
affected
and
so
on.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
that's
what
the
congress
certainly
--.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
contemplated
an
expedited
procedure
not
necessarily
a
summary
one,
that's
why
they
proposed
a
four
months
limit.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
it
does.
and
the
reason
it
does
your
honor
is
because
under
the
criteria
governing
judicial
review
in
the
administrative
procedure
act
the
decision
whether
to
open
an
investigation
or
not
is
committed
to
the
agency's
discretion
and
hence
is
not
reviewable,
but
once
it
has
taken
agency
action
which
has
a
substantial
impact
on
people
who
are
protesting
that
action
and
who
are
affected
by
it
then
there
is
a
right
of
review.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
commission
can
take
more
than
four
months
but
its
suspension
of
the
railroad's
discontinuance.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
its
only
four
months
and
the
commission
endeavors
to
wind
this
proceedings
up
rapidly
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
boils
down
in
a
sense
to
a
fairness
question.
i'd
say
only
that
on
the
law
what
you
got
here
is
a
declaratory
order
in
effect.
of
the
kind
that
was
used
in
the
frozen
food
express
case,
and
there,
the
court
held
that
an
order
would
simply
have
the
effect
of
declaring
what
certain
rights
--
a
commission
order
declaring
certain
rights
under
the
agricultural
exemption
to
the
law
was
said
to
be
reviewable.
now
that
order
i
might
say
in
the
frozen
food
express
case
contained
the
same
language
that
we
have
in
this
case.
it
made
--
the
order
made
certain
findings
of
--
the
commission
made
certain
findings,
it
incorporated
those
findings
and
its
order
by
reference
and
it
said
the
investigation
is
discontinued.
there's
nothing
magic
in
that
formula,
well,
that's
just
something
the
commission
says
all
the
time.
it
says
it
in
rate
proceedings
as
mr.
macdougall
pointed
it
out.
what
we've
got
here
it
seems
to
the
government
is
just
a
disregard
of
this
court's
decision
in
rochester
telephone
corporation
against
united
states.
here
we
have
people
who
go
into
the
commission
and
protest
the
discontinuance
of
a
train.
they
are
asking
the
commission
to
order
something.
order
the
continuance
of
that
train.
they
are
denied
that
order.
when
they
are
denied
in
order,
they
have
a
reviewable
situation.
and
in
rochester
telephone,
this
court
said,
"in
order
of
the
commission
dismissing
a
complaint
on
the
merits
and
maintaining
the
status
quo,
is
an
exercise
of
administrative
function
no
more
and
no
less
than
an
order
directing
some
change
in
status."
and
the
court
held
that
kind
of
an
order
to
be
reviewable
in
rochester
and
that's
all
we
got
here.
now
the
lower
courts
have
relied
particularly
on
united
states
against
los
angeles
railway
company.
the
granddaddy
of
this
line
of
cases
that
says
that
these
things
aren't
reviewable,
is
it
state
of
minnesota
against
united
states
to
minnesota
court
decision
which
pick
up
the
los
angeles
case,
los
angeles
case
involved
a
valuation
order,
and
justice
brandeis
for
this
court
said
that
this
order
which
simply
declares
what
the
value
of
the
railroads
property
is
not
a
reviewable
order.
because
nothing
happens
as
a
result
but
nobody's
ordered
to
do
anything
and
nobody
is
affected
by
it
anyway.
well,
this
court
held
only
in
that
case
that
the
valuation
order
since
it
didn't
affect
anything
was
not
right
for
review.
the
impact
of
that
valuation
order
would
be
felt
when
and
if
the
commission
did
something
on
the
basis
of
it.
so
the
los
angeles
case
is
only
a
ripeness
case.
and
certainly
not
a
basis
for
denying
review
in
this
kind
of
situation
where
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
that
there's
a
direct
impact
which
makes
the
case
right
for
review.
now
we've
mentioned
briefly
the
legislative
history.
the
desire
to
expedite
the
discontinuance
of
trains
to
avoid
the
delays
that
occurred
in
the
state
proceedings,
now
the
desire
for
speed,
the
desire
for
expedition
is
not
inconsistent
with
judicial
review.
and
judicial
review
doesn't
mean
that
in
every
case,
a
train
whose
discontinuance
is
permitted
by
the
commission
will
be
kept
in
operation
by
the
courts.
out
of
some
147
discontinuances,
after
investigation
since
the
commission
or
since
the
statute
was
adopted,
i
think
there
have
been
only
six
or
i
think
it's
nine,
now
there
have
been
three
more.
there
had
only
been
nine
cases
in
which
temporary
relief
has
been
granted
pending
judicial
review.
and
of
course,
whether
temporary
relief
is
going
to
be
granted
at
all
in
any
of
these
cases
and
that's
really
what
the
railroads
are
afraid
of,
is
a
matter
of
the
kind
of
showing
made
by
the
plaintiff's
in
the
case.
you
don't
get
preliminary
injunctions
as
a
matter
of
course
from
three-judge
courts.
the
urgent
deficiencies
act
contemplates
that
the
courts
are
going
to
act
with
expedition.
and
the
real
issue
is
expedition
in
the
review
process
not
denying
review
altogether.
now
the
only
other
two
grounds
that
i
relied
on
to
deny
review
are
first
that
there
are
some
difference
in
the
substantive
standard
between
13
(a)
(1)
which
is
the
--
which
governs
interstate
trains
and
13
(a)
(2)
which
governs
intrastate
trains.
the
railroad
seemed
to
concede
that
under
13
(a)
(2)
there
is
judicial
review.
but
the
answer
to
that
is
that
this
court
has
said
in
southern
railway
company
against
north
carolina
that
the
substantive
standards
are
the
same
and
in
fact
if
you
look
at
them
although
there
are
some
slight
word
in
differences
it
amounts
to
the
same
thing.
public
convenience
and
well
does
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
hereof
require
the
continuance
of
the
train.
will
it
unduly
burden
interstate
commerce?
i've
mentioned
we've
discussed,
i
think
at
some
length
the
other
reason
this
a
fortiori
argument
that
if
you
open
an
investigation
or
if
you
don't
open
an
investigation,
it
has
the
same
effect
as
if
you
did
open
an
investigation.
they
are
different
because
the
standards
for
review
are
different.
i
think
the
best
analogy
one
can
give
is
the
situation
in
which
the
general
counsel
at
the
nlrb
issues
a
complaint.
now,
his
decision
to
issue
a
complaint
or
not
issue
a
complaint
is
a
matter
of
his
discretion.
it's
not
reviewable.
but
if
he
issues
a
complaint
and
the
nlrb
acts
on
that
complaint,
that
is
judicially
reviewable.
for
these
reasons
and
the
unfairness,
of
the
standard
the
railroads
are
arguing
which
says
that
commuters
and
communities
are
not
entitled
to
judicial
review
but
railroads
are.
we
think
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
wrong.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
although
defendants
below
supports
the
rights
of
the
appellants
to
obtain
judicial
review
of
the
commission's
decision
permitting
discontinuance
of
the
trains
involved
in
this
case.
we
do
so
for
two
legal
reasons.
first,
that
under
the
criteria
applicable
to
review
of
administrative
actions,
as
incorporated
in
the
administrative
procedure
act
the
commission's
decisions
in
these
cases
represent
agency
action
which
is
reviewable.
and
second,
nothing
in
the
history
of
the
statute
or
in
its
text
indicates
a
congressional
intent
to
foreclose
judicial
review
that
would
otherwise
be
available.
now
the
commission's
decision
in
these
two
cases
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
congress
did
intend
to
put
this
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
decision
to
investigate
it
all
rest
on
a
slightly
different
basis.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
within
the
discretion
of
the
agency.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
and
is
non-reviewable.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
we
agree
with
the
new
jersey
case.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
once
an
investigation
is
under
your
can't
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
now
let
me
turn
to
that
order
because
i
think
that's
really
the
heart
of
our
problem
here.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that's
right.
if
your
honors
will
look
in
the
record
at
page
41
and
at
page
67,
you'll
see
the
two
basic
orders
that
the
commission
entered
here.
now
those
orders
were
entered
after
a
full
hearing.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
67,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
those
orders
were
entered
after
a
full
hearing
on
the
merits.
incidentally
that
is
the
only
kind
of
investigation
the
commission
can
give
in
this
county
under
13
(a)
(1)
if
it
is
going
to
have
power
to
order
the
railroad
to
continue
the
train.
it
cannot
order
the
railroad
to
continue
the
train
without
conducting
a
hearing.
so
once
it
opens
an
investigation,
there
has
to
be
a
full
hearing.
now
what
it
does
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
oh!
it
is
a
conceivable
railroad
--
mr.
howard
e.

mr.

but
the

if

the

apply
the
wrong
legal
standard,
then
the
railroad
would
have
to
--
the
commission
would
have
to
direct
the
railroad
to
continue
the
train
in
effect
for
another
year
which
is
what
the
statute
would
provide.
so
that
what
we've
got
is
an
order
here
which
does
more
than
just
discontinue
the
investigation.
it
makes
a
substantive
determination.
and
that
substantive
determination
has
a
substantial
impact
on
the
communities
affected
and
because
of
that
impact
it
amounts
to
a
reviewable
order.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
correct.
what
the
commission
has
to
decide
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well
in
determining
whether
they
should
be
investigation
of
course,
they
have
to
consider
the
standards
of
the
act.
but
there's
more
to
it.
when
an
agency
is
going
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
investigate
something,
not
only
is
it
considering
the
substantive
standards
involved,
it
also
has
to
make
other
to
take
into
account
other
considerations,
its
resources,
the
situation,
the
importance
of
the
termination
to
the
area
affected
and
so
on.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
that's
what
the
congress
certainly
--.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
contemplated
an
expedited
procedure
not
necessarily
a
summary
one,
that's
why
they
proposed
a
four
months
limit.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
it
does.
and
the
reason
it
does
your
honor
is
because
under
the
criteria
governing
judicial
review
in
the
administrative
procedure
act
the
decision
whether
to
open
an
investigation
or
not
is
committed
to
the
agency's
discretion
and
hence
is
not
reviewable,
but
once
it
has
taken
agency
action
which
has
a
substantial
impact
on
people
who
are
protesting
that
action
and
who
are
affected
by
it
then
there
is
a
right
of
review.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
commission
can
take
more
than
four
months
but
its
suspension
of
the
railroad's
discontinuance.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
its
only
four
months
and
the
commission
endeavors
to
wind
this
proceedings
up
rapidly
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
boils
down
in
a
sense
to
a
fairness
question.
i'd
say
only
that
on
the
law
what
you
got
here
is
a
declaratory
order
in
effect.
of
the
kind
that
was
used
in
the
frozen
food
express
case,
and
there,
the
court
held
that
an
order
would
simply
have
the
effect
of
declaring
what
certain
rights
--
a
commission
order
declaring
certain
rights
under
the
agricultural
exemption
to
the
law
was
said
to
be
reviewable.
now
that
order
i
might
say
in
the
frozen
food
express
case
contained
the
same
language
that
we
have
in
this
case.
it
made
--
the
order
made
certain
findings
of
--
the
commission
made
certain
findings,
it
incorporated
those
findings
and
its
order
by
reference
and
it
said
the
investigation
is
discontinued.
there's
nothing
magic
in
that
formula,
well,
that's
just
something
the
commission
says
all
the
time.
it
says
it
in
rate
proceedings
as
mr.
macdougall
pointed
it
out.
what
we've
got
here
it
seems
to
the
government
is
just
a
disregard
of
this
court's
decision
in
rochester
telephone
corporation
against
united
states.
here
we
have
people
who
go
into
the
commission
and
protest
the
discontinuance
of
a
train.
they
are
asking
the
commission
to
order
something.
order
the
continuance
of
that
train.
they
are
denied
that
order.
when
they
are
denied
in
order,
they
have
a
reviewable
situation.
and
in
rochester
telephone,
this
court
said,
"in
order
of
the
commission
dismissing
a
complaint
on
the
merits
and
maintaining
the
status
quo,
is
an
exercise
of
administrative
function
no
more
and
no
less
than
an
order
directing
some
change
in
status."
and
the
court
held
that
kind
of
an
order
to
be
reviewable
in
rochester
and
that's
all
we
got
here.
now
the
lower
courts
have
relied
particularly
on
united
states
against
los
angeles
railway
company.
the
granddaddy
of
this
line
of
cases
that
says
that
these
things
aren't
reviewable,
is
it
state
of
minnesota
against
united
states
to
minnesota
court
decision
which
pick
up
the
los
angeles
case,
los
angeles
case
involved
a
valuation
order,
and
justice
brandeis
for
this
court
said
that
this
order
which
simply
declares
what
the
value
of
the
railroads
property
is
not
a
reviewable
order.
because
nothing
happens
as
a
result
but
nobody's
ordered
to
do
anything
and
nobody
is
affected
by
it
anyway.
well,
this
court
held
only
in
that
case
that
the
valuation
order
since
it
didn't
affect
anything
was
not
right
for
review.
the
impact
of
that
valuation
order
would
be
felt
when
and
if
the
commission
did
something
on
the
basis
of
it.
so
the
los
angeles
case
is
only
a
ripeness
case.
and
certainly
not
a
basis
for
denying
review
in
this
kind
of
situation
where
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
that
there's
a
direct
impact
which
makes
the
case
right
for
review.
now
we've
mentioned
briefly
the
legislative
history.
the
desire
to
expedite
the
discontinuance
of
trains
to
avoid
the
delays
that
occurred
in
the
state
proceedings,
now
the
desire
for
speed,
the
desire
for
expedition
is
not
inconsistent
with
judicial
review.
and
judicial
review
doesn't
mean
that
in
every
case,
a
train
whose
discontinuance
is
permitted
by
the
commission
will
be
kept
in
operation
by
the
courts.
out
of
some
147
discontinuances,
after
investigation
since
the
commission
or
since
the
statute
was
adopted,
i
think
there
have
been
only
six
or
i
think
it's
nine,
now
there
have
been
three
more.
there
had
only
been
nine
cases
in
which
temporary
relief
has
been
granted
pending
judicial
review.
and
of
course,
whether
temporary
relief
is
going
to
be
granted
at
all
in
any
of
these
cases
and
that's
really
what
the
railroads
are
afraid
of,
is
a
matter
of
the
kind
of
showing
made
by
the
plaintiff's
in
the
case.
you
don't
get
preliminary
injunctions
as
a
matter
of
course
from
three-judge
courts.
the
urgent
deficiencies
act
contemplates
that
the
courts
are
going
to
act
with
expedition.
and
the
real
issue
is
expedition
in
the
review
process
not
denying
review
altogether.
now
the
only
other
two
grounds
that
i
relied
on
to
deny
review
are
first
that
there
are
some
difference
in
the
substantive
standard
between
13
(a)
(1)
which
is
the
--
which
governs
interstate
trains
and
13
(a)
(2)
which
governs
intrastate
trains.
the
railroad
seemed
to
concede
that
under
13
(a)
(2)
there
is
judicial
review.
but
the
answer
to
that
is
that
this
court
has
said
in
southern
railway
company
against
north
carolina
that
the
substantive
standards
are
the
same
and
in
fact
if
you
look
at
them
although
there
are
some
slight
word
in
differences
it
amounts
to
the
same
thing.
public
convenience
and
well
does
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
hereof
require
the
continuance
of
the
train.
will
it
unduly
burden
interstate
commerce?
i've
mentioned
we've
discussed,
i
think
at
some
length
the
other
reason
this
a
fortiori
argument
that
if
you
open
an
investigation
or
if
you
don't
open
an
investigation,
it
has
the
same
effect
as
if
you
did
open
an
investigation.
they
are
different
because
the
standards
for
review
are
different.
i
think
the
best
analogy
one
can
give
is
the
situation
in
which
the
general
counsel
at
the
nlrb
issues
a
complaint.
now,
his
decision
to
issue
a
complaint
or
not
issue
a
complaint
is
a
matter
of
his
discretion.
it's
not
reviewable.
but
if
he
issues
a
complaint
and
the
nlrb
acts
on
that
complaint,
that
is
judicially
reviewable.
for
these
reasons
and
the
unfairness,
of
the
standard
the
railroads
are
arguing
which
says
that
commuters
and
communities
are
not
entitled
to
judicial
review
but
railroads
are.
we
think
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
wrong.
