mr.
james
w.
hoeland
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
section
13
(a)
(1)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
is
unique
among
the
various
provisions
of
the
act.
and
that
the
authority
to
discontinue
interstate
passenger
trains
comes
directly
from
the
statute
and
not
from
any
action
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
it
was
passed
by
congress
to
meet
a
pressing
problem
to
enable
railroads
to
promptly
and
effectively
remove
unneeded
and
not
used
passenger
trains
from
their
system.
and
we
submit
respectfully
that
the
concept
of
judicial
review
will
frustrate
the
very
intent
that
under
which
congress
enact
section
13
(a)
(1).
section
13
(a)
(1)
is
self-implementing.
and
it
grants
to
the
carrier
upon
posting
of
a
30-day
notice
the
right
to
discontinue
the
train
that
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
need
do
nothing.
the
statute
applies
in
30
days
of
trains
go
off.
now
if
the
commission
orders
an
investigation,
they
must
notify
the
carriers
at
least
10
days
before
the
train
is
to
stop.
they
don't
do
that.
the
train
goes
off
at
the
end
of
30
days.
then
the
effect
of
the
30-day
or
the
investigation
is
to
postpone
for
an
additional
four-month
period
the
time
within
which
the
railroads
are
authorize
by
statute
to
discontinue
the
trains.
now
the
investigation
--
mr.
james
w.
hoeland
it
is
indeed
your
honor
because
the
interstate
commerce
commission
can
prevent
the
discontinuance
of
an
interstate
train
only
on
the
finding
by
the
commission
that
a
public
need
exist
for
the
train
and
that
it
is
not
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
for
the
train
to
be
continued.
now
this
is
the
only
order
that
can
be
issued
in
an
investigation
proceeding.
their
discontinuance
although
they
label
it
in
order,
the
commission
labels
it
in
order
is
not
in
fact
an
order
because
the
railroads
are
simply
taking
advantage
of
what
the
statute
grants
them.
the
right
to
discontinue
the
notice
or
order
as
the
commission
calls
it
is
simply
a
means
of
notifying
the
people
who
participated
in
the
proceeding
as
to
what
the
commission
has
done
with
the
case.
if
they
can't
make
the
specific
statutory
findings
and
both
of
them,
then
there
is
no
basis
under
which
the
railroad
can
be
required
to
keep
the
trains
on
for
a
period
of
maximum
period
of
one
year.
in
that
regard,
there
is
a
great
difference
between
the
provisions
of
section
13
(a)
(1)
and
section
13
(a)
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
a
railroad
which
wants
to
take
off
an
intrastate
passenger
train
must
first
proceed
before
the
state
regulatory
body.
if
that
state
does
nothing
within
a
120
days
or
acts
unfavorably
within
that
period
they
then
have
the
right
to
petition
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
seek
authority
from
the
commission.
this
isn't
a
matter
of
authority
coming
from
the
statute.
this
authority
comes
from
the
commission
and
the
railroad
has
the
burden
of
meeting
both
of
the
statutory
standards.
in
order
to
discontinue
an
intrastate
train
by
contrast,
the
parties
other
than
the
commission
must
find
rather
that
both
public
need
requires
continued
operation
of
the
interstate
commerce
--
of
an
interstate
train.
and
two,
that
an
undue
burden
would
not
be
placed
upon
the
railroads
by
that
continued
operation.
in
other
words,
the
commission
has
to
meet
both
statutory
standards
for
an
interstate
train
to
be
taken
of
whereas
the
corollary
has
to
be
proven
by
the
carriers.
the
carriers
have
nothing
to
prove
in
the
13
(a)
(1)
proceeding.
they
can
take
off
an
interstate
train
for
any
reason
they
choose.
so
long
as
they
publish
the
required
notice.
i
think
it
is
abundantly
clear
to
everyone
that
section
13
(a)
is
an
altogether
different
section
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
than
any
other
section.
the
district
court
in
the
new
jersey
case
which
this
court
affirmed
in
county
bergen
made
the
statement,
section
13
(a)
(1)
embodies
a
new
and
distinct
exercise
of
the
congressional
power.
its
language
is
clear
and
unambiguous.
and
therefore
neither
admits
or
nor
requires
any
construction
by
comparison
with
any
other
section
or
subsection
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
as
amended.
the
statute
itself
is
self-implementing
the
other
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
or
not.
for
example,
if
a
railroad
seeks
to
abandon
a
line
of
railroad,
it
must
do
so
by
applying
to
the
commission
and
seeking
the
commission's
authority
and
the
only
basis
under
which
that
authority
can
be
granted
is
by
the
commission
issuing
a
certificate
at
present
or
future
public
convenience
and
necessity
permits.
it's
the
commission's
decision,
the
commission's
authority.
it
is
totally
different
than
what
you
have
involved
in
section
13
(a)
(1).
i
might
say
that
that
commission
itself
has
consistently
recognized
that
it
is
not
given
the
authority
to
approve
or
disapprove
an
interstate
train
can
discontinuance
under
section
13
(a)
(1).
in
the
great
northern
case
at
307
icc
59,
page
76,
they
specifically
held
that
we
have
no
discretion
to
approve
or
disapprove
a
proposed
discontinuance.
our
duty
is
in
appropriate
cases
to
investigate
the
facts
and
only
if
such
investigation
warrants
the
findings
specified
in
the
statute
may
we
require
a
railroad
to
continue
or
restore
the
service
which
is
the
subject
of
the
investigation.
mr.
james
w.
hoeland
i
distinguish
that
your
honor
on
the
--
with
respect
to
perhaps
a
section
13
(a)
(2)
proceeding
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
they
are
there
called
upon
to
approve
or
disapprove
the
proposal
of
the
railroad
to
discontinue
the
train.
the
statute
does
not
give
--
13
(a)
(1)
does
not
give
to
the
commission
the
power
to
disapprove
or
approve.
the
statute
gives
the
commission
only
one-fifth
of
limited
veto
power.
limited
jurisdiction
to
require
the
railroad
to
continue
to
operate
the
trains
for
an
additional
year
if
the
commission
finds
after
investigation:
one,
that
there
is
a
public
need
for
the
trains
and
two,
that
continued
operation
would
not
constitute
an
undue
burden.
unless
the
commission
can
make
both
of
those
findings,
the
railroad
discontinues
a
train
by
operation
statute
and
not
by
any
commission
order
of
lack
of
order
and
this
is
why
you
get
into
the
question
of
fairness
or
lack
of
fairness.
you
do
not
have
--
you
only
have
an
order
issued
by
the
commission
in
those
instances
and
when
the
commission
orders
a
railroad
to
continue
the
operation
for
a
year.
as
this
court
has
held
in
the
atlantic
coast
line
case,
icc
versus
atlantic
coast
line
that
a
commission
order
is
reviewable
if
it
determines
rights
or
obligations
from
which
legal
consequences
may
flow.
i
respectfully
submit
that
there
are
no
legal
rights
in
the
interest
of
the
appellants
in
this
case
to
which
they
are
entitled
to
judicially
review.
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
answered
that
question
in
the
new
jersey
case
because
if
the
appellants
have
a
right
in
a
13
--
section
13
(a)
proceeding,
that
right
should
certainly
survive
the
decision
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
whether
it
would
or
would
not
investigate
a
train
off
case.
in
those
instances
where
the
commission
refuses
to
investigate,
the
interest
of
communities
in
the
state
of
new
jersey,
its
public
service
commission
and
the
county
of
bergen
and
all
others
certainly
was
as
great
as
it
is
when
the
commission
sets
a
case
down
for
hearing
that
this
court
has
held
that
there
is
no
judicial
review
where
the
commission
does
not
investigate.
now,
it
certainly
there's
nothing
in
the
manner
in
which
congress
drafted
section
13
(a)
(1)
that
suggest
any
fragmentizing
of
the
question
of
judicial
review
depending
on
whether
the
icc
decides
to
investigate
or
whether
it
doesn't.
and
in
a
corollary
to
that
point,
i
believe
is
the
fact
that
the
argument
of
the
government
in
this
case
is
that
the
icc
decides
whether
judicial
review
is
available.
now
certainly
congress
never
intended
that
when
they
enacted
section
13
(a)
(1).
but
the
government
says
if
the
commission
does
not
investigate,
then
it
is
not
subject
to
judicial
review.
however,
if
the
commission
does
investigate,
it
is
subject
to
the
judicial
review.
now,
the
question
of
whether
an
investigation
is
held
or
not,
is
dependent
according
to
government
solely
on
the
question
of
whether
a
substantial
question
exists.
and
so
by
the
simple
expedient
of
the
commission
deciding
whether
or
not
a
substantial
question
exists,
judicial
review
is
or
is
not
had
but
it
is
not
certainly
in
the
statute
that
nor
an
intention
of
congress
when
it
enacted
section
13
(a)
(1)
that
any
such
distinction
could
ever
be
drawn.
i
might
say
your
honors,
that
in
other
point
which
bears
very
directly
on
this
issue
and
that
on
the
question
of
judicial
review
are
the
circumstances
underlying
the
enactment
of
section
13
(a)
(1).
in
1958,
the
railroads
were
in
dire
financial
condition.
they
were
losing
at
the
rate
of
about
$700
million
a
year
on
their
passenger
train
operations
alone.
theretofore,
the
railroads
were
relegated
to
the
piecemeal
approach
of
going
to
each
of
the
various
states
to
which
the
interstate
train
operates
and
to
seek
their
authority
to
discontinue
train
frequently
that
authority
was
denied
or
in
many
cases
unduly
delayed
and
as
a
consequence,
congress
was
highly
concerned
with
the
extensive
delays
that
were
being
experience
and
the
costly
of
delays
and
burdens
on
the
railroads
to
operate
unneeded
and
costly
passenger
trains.
this
was
the
very
purpose
that
congress
entered
the
field
and
when
it
did
it
gave
the
carriers
the
right
to
completely
bypass
any
state
regulatory
proceeding
by
the
expedient
of
filing
a
notice
which
in
30
days
would
enable
them
to
discontinue
the
train
unless
postpone
for
another
four
months
by
the
institution
of
an
investigation.
the
government
and
appellants
would
have
this
court
believe
that
the
concept
of
judicial
review
is
not
incompatible
with
the
intent
of
congress
to
dispose
of
these
cases
as
promptly
as
possible.
congress
has
set
a
maximum
period
of
five
months
under
which
a
train
has
to
be
operated
unless
the
commission
issues
an
order
base
on
the
two
statutory
standards
previously
mentioned
requiring
continued
operation
for
one
more
year.
but
the
point
i
think
is
establish
by
the
circumstances
in
number
102,
the
l
&
n
trains
that
are
involved
in
the
so-called
hummingbird
trains
between
cincinnati
and
new
orleans.
the
day
before
the
discontinuance
was
to
take
effect,
the
appellants,
filed
suit
in
the
federal
court
in
chicago
and
obtained
the
temporary
restraining
order
which
restraining
order
remained
in
effect
for
a
period
of
nine
months
after
the
date
that
the
l
&
n
filed
its
notice
to
discontinue
the
trains.
congress
set
the
period
at
five
months
as
a
maximum.
and
yet,
here
the
l
&
n
was
operating
a
train
that
was
losing
money
at
the
rate
of
a
million
dollars
a
year
for
an
additional
period
time
without
any
protection
of
the
bond
and
i
there
say
that
if
this
court
had
granted
a
stay
at
the
district
court's
order
then
we
would
still
be
operating
it.we
would
be
losing
at
the
rate
of
a
million
and
a
half
dollars
would
have
lost
it,
at
least
a
million
and
a
half
dollars
by
now
and
the
continuing
to
operate
until
further
order
of
the
court.
i
would
certainly
don't
think
that
there's
any
consistency
between
the
intention
of
congress
in
enacting
and
putting
on
a
maximum
five
months
statutory
suspension
period
and
the
concept
to
judicial
review
where
railroads
are
frequently
faced
with
temporary
restraining
orders
where
bonds
are
not
given
for
the
adequate
protection
of
any
damages
that
might
be
given.
i
might
want
to
say
one
more
thing
if
your
honors
please
with
respect
to
the
los
angeles
case.
as
this
court
held
in
that
proceeding
that
there
are
so-called
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
are
not
subject
to
judicial
review,
with
respect
to
the
discontinuance
of
a
proceeding
under
section
13
(a)
(1)
that
commission
does
characterized
its
discontinuance
as
an
order.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
they
should
characterize
it
as
an
order
and
in
fact
it's
nothing
more
that
a
notice
to
the
parties
and
if
anything
a
housekeeping
order.
it
is
not
an
order
ordering
anybody
to
do
anything
in
this
case.
and
under
those
circumstances,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
of
los
angeles
is
in
effect
apposite
to
this
point.
and
what
is
--
what
the
commission
has
simply
done
in
issuing
its
so-called
order
of
noticing
discontinuance,
it
is
merely
the
statement
of
the
results
of
its
investigation.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
james
w.
hoeland
the
statute
requires
that
the
--
well,
let's
put
in
the
other
way.
it
says
if
the
commission
finds
that
continued
operation
is
required
to
issue
an
order
requiring
continued
operation,
but
the
commission
has
always
held
that
the
opposite
applies
that
once
they
enter
an
investigation,
once
they
hold
hearings,
that
they
have
to
make
findings.
findings
as
to
whether
the
trains
are
required
by
public
convenience
necessity
whether
they're
not.
and
that
decision
is
the
great
northern
decision
reported
at
307
icc.
and
also
the,
as
i
said
section
14
(a)
requires
findings
and
a
report
and
i
think
also
the
administrative
procedure
act
requires
it
in
any
investigation.
mr.
james
w.
hoeland
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
section
13

(1)
of
the
interstate

is
unique
among
the
various

of

and
that

we
submit
respectfully
that
the
concept
of
judicial
review
will
frustrate
the
very
intent
that
under
which
congress
enact
section
13
(a)
(1).
section
13
(a)
(1)
is
self-implementing.
and
it
grants
to
the
carrier
upon
posting
of
a
30-day
notice
the
right
to
discontinue
the
train
that
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
need
do
nothing.
the
statute
applies
in
30
days
of
trains
go
off.
now
if
the
commission
orders
an
investigation,
they
must
notify
the
carriers
at
least
10
days
before
the
train
is
to
stop.
they
don't
do
that.
the
train
goes
off
at
the
end
of
30
days.
then
the
effect
of
the
30-day
or
the
investigation
is
to
postpone
for
an
additional
four-month
period
the
time
within
which
the
railroads
are
authorize
by
statute
to
discontinue
the
trains.
now
the
investigation
--
mr.
james
w.
hoeland
it
is
indeed
your
honor
because
the
interstate
commerce
commission
can
prevent
the
discontinuance
of
an
interstate
train
only
on
the
finding
by
the
commission
that
a
public
need
exist
for
the
train
and
that
it
is
not
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
for
the
train
to
be
continued.
now
this
is
the
only
order
that
can
be
issued
in
an
investigation
proceeding.
their
discontinuance
although
they
label
it
in
order,
the
commission
labels
it
in
order
is
not
in
fact
an
order
because
the
railroads
are
simply
taking
advantage
of
what
the
statute
grants
them.
the
right
to
discontinue
the
notice
or
order
as
the
commission
calls
it
is
simply
a
means
of
notifying
the
people
who
participated
in
the
proceeding
as
to
what
the
commission
has
done
with
the
case.
if
they
can't
make
the
specific
statutory
findings
and
both
of
them,
then
there
is
no
basis
under
which
the
railroad
can
be
required
to
keep
the
trains
on
for
a
period
of
maximum
period
of
one
year.
in
that
regard,
there
is
a
great
difference
between
the
provisions
of
section
13
(a)
(1)
and
section
13
(a)
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
a
railroad
which
wants
to
take
off
an
intrastate
passenger
train
must
first
proceed
before
the
state
regulatory
body.
if
that
state
does
nothing
within
a
120
days
or
acts
unfavorably
within
that
period
they
then
have
the
right
to
petition
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
seek
authority
from
the
commission.
this
isn't
a
matter
of
authority
coming
from
the
statute.
this
authority
comes
from
the
commission
and
the
railroad
has
the
burden
of
meeting
both
of
the
statutory
standards.
in
order
to
discontinue
an
intrastate
train
by
contrast,
the
parties
other
than
the
commission
must
find
rather
that
both
public
need
requires
continued
operation
of
the
interstate
commerce
--
of
an
interstate
train.
and
two,
that
an
undue
burden
would
not
be
placed
upon
the
railroads
by
that
continued
operation.
in
other
words,
the
commission
has
to
meet
both
statutory
standards
for
an
interstate
train
to
be
taken
of
whereas
the
corollary
has
to
be
proven
by
the
carriers.
the
carriers
have
nothing
to
prove
in
the
13
(a)
(1)
proceeding.
they
can
take
off
an
interstate
train
for
any
reason
they
choose.
so
long
as
they
publish
the
required
notice.
i
think
it
is
abundantly
clear
to
everyone
that
section
13
(a)
is
an
altogether
different
section
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
than
any
other
section.
the
district
court
in
the
new
jersey
case
which
this
court
affirmed
in
county
bergen
made
the
statement,
section
13
(a)
(1)
embodies
a
new
and
distinct
exercise
of
the
congressional
power.
its
language
is
clear
and
unambiguous.
and
therefore
neither
admits
or
nor
requires
any
construction
by
comparison
with
any
other
section
or
subsection
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
as
amended.
the
statute
itself
is
self-implementing
the
other
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
or
not.
for
example,
if
a
railroad
seeks
to
abandon
a
line
of
railroad,
it
must
do
so
by
applying
to
the
commission
and
seeking
the
commission's
authority
and
the
only
basis
under
which
that
authority
can
be
granted
is
by
the
commission
issuing
a
certificate
at
present
or
future
public
convenience
and
necessity
permits.
it's
the
commission's
decision,
the
commission's
authority.
it
is
totally
different
than
what
you
have
involved
in
section
13
(a)
(1).
i
might
say
that
that
commission
itself
has
consistently
recognized
that
it
is
not
given
the
authority
to
approve
or
disapprove
an
interstate
train
can
discontinuance
under
section
13
(a)
(1).
in
the
great
northern
case
at
307
icc
59,
page
76,
they
specifically
held
that
we
have
no
discretion
to
approve
or
disapprove
a
proposed
discontinuance.
our
duty
is
in
appropriate
cases
to
investigate
the
facts
and
only
if
such
investigation
warrants
the
findings
specified
in
the
statute
may
we
require
a
railroad
to
continue
or
restore
the
service
which
is
the
subject
of
the
investigation.
mr.
james
w.
hoeland
i
distinguish
that
your
honor
on
the
--
with
respect
to
perhaps
a
section
13
(a)
(2)
proceeding
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
they
are
there
called
upon
to
approve
or
disapprove
the
proposal
of
the
railroad
to
discontinue
the
train.
the
statute
does
not
give
--
13
(a)
(1)
does
not
give
to
the
commission
the
power
to
disapprove
or
approve.
the
statute
gives
the
commission
only
one-fifth
of
limited
veto
power.
limited
jurisdiction
to
require
the
railroad
to
continue
to
operate
the
trains
for
an
additional
year
if
the
commission
finds
after
investigation:
one,
that
there
is
a
public
need
for
the
trains
and
two,
that
continued
operation
would
not
constitute
an
undue
burden.
unless
the
commission
can
make
both
of
those
findings,
the
railroad
discontinues
a
train
by
operation
statute
and
not
by
any
commission
order
of
lack
of
order
and
this
is
why
you
get
into
the
question
of
fairness
or
lack
of
fairness.
you
do
not
have
--
you
only
have
an
order
issued
by
the
commission
in
those
instances
and
when
the
commission
orders
a
railroad
to
continue
the
operation
for
a
year.
as
this
court
has
held
in
the
atlantic
coast
line
case,
icc
versus
atlantic
coast
line
that
a
commission
order
is
reviewable
if
it
determines
rights
or
obligations
from
which
legal
consequences
may
flow.
i
respectfully
submit
that
there
are
no
legal
rights
in
the
interest
of
the
appellants
in
this
case
to
which
they
are
entitled
to
judicially
review.
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
answered
that
question
in
the
new
jersey
case
because
if
the
appellants
have
a
right
in
a
13
--
section
13
(a)
proceeding,
that
right
should
certainly
survive
the
decision
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
whether
it
would
or
would
not
investigate
a
train
off
case.
in
those
instances
where
the
commission
refuses
to
investigate,
the
interest
of
communities
in
the
state
of
new
jersey,
its
public
service
commission
and
the
county
of
bergen
and
all
others
certainly
was
as
great
as
it
is
when
the
commission
sets
a
case
down
for
hearing
that
this
court
has
held
that
there
is
no
judicial
review
where
the
commission
does
not
investigate.
now,
it
certainly
there's
nothing
in
the
manner
in
which
congress
drafted
section
13
(a)
(1)
that
suggest
any
fragmentizing
of
the
question
of
judicial
review
depending
on
whether
the
icc
decides
to
investigate
or
whether
it
doesn't.
and
in
a
corollary
to
that
point,
i
believe
is
the
fact
that
the
argument
of
the
government
in
this
case
is
that
the
icc
decides
whether
judicial
review
is
available.
now
certainly
congress
never
intended
that
when
they
enacted
section
13
(a)
(1).
but
the
government
says
if
the
commission
does
not
investigate,
then
it
is
not
subject
to
judicial
review.
however,
if
the
commission
does
investigate,
it
is
subject
to
the
judicial
review.
now,
the
question
of
whether
an
investigation
is
held
or
not,
is
dependent
according
to
government
solely
on
the
question
of
whether
a
substantial
question
exists.
and
so
by
the
simple
expedient
of
the
commission
deciding
whether
or
not
a
substantial
question
exists,
judicial
review
is
or
is
not
had
but
it
is
not
certainly
in
the
statute
that
nor
an
intention
of
congress
when
it
enacted
section
13
(a)
(1)
that
any
such
distinction
could
ever
be
drawn.
i
might
say
your
honors,
that
in
other
point
which
bears
very
directly
on
this
issue
and
that
on
the
question
of
judicial
review
are
the
circumstances
underlying
the
enactment
of
section
13
(a)
(1).
in
1958,
the
railroads
were
in
dire
financial
condition.
they
were
losing
at
the
rate
of
about
$700
million
a
year
on
their
passenger
train
operations
alone.
theretofore,
the
railroads
were
relegated
to
the
piecemeal
approach
of
going
to
each
of
the
various
states
to
which
the
interstate
train
operates
and
to
seek
their
authority
to
discontinue
train
frequently
that
authority
was
denied
or
in
many
cases
unduly
delayed
and
as
a
consequence,
congress
was
highly
concerned
with
the
extensive
delays
that
were
being
experience
and
the
costly
of
delays
and
burdens
on
the
railroads
to
operate
unneeded
and
costly
passenger
trains.
this
was
the
very
purpose
that
congress
entered
the
field
and
when
it
did
it
gave
the
carriers
the
right
to
completely
bypass
any
state
regulatory
proceeding
by
the
expedient
of
filing
a
notice
which
in
30
days
would
enable
them
to
discontinue
the
train
unless
postpone
for
another
four
months
by
the
institution
of
an
investigation.
the
government
and
appellants
would
have
this
court
believe
that
the
concept
of
judicial
review
is
not
incompatible
with
the
intent
of
congress
to
dispose
of
these
cases
as
promptly
as
possible.
congress
has
set
a
maximum
period
of
five
months
under
which
a
train
has
to
be
operated
unless
the
commission
issues
an
order
base
on
the
two
statutory
standards
previously
mentioned
requiring
continued
operation
for
one
more
year.
but
the
point
i
think
is
establish
by
the
circumstances
in
number
102,
the
l
&
n
trains
that
are
involved
in
the
so-called
hummingbird
trains
between
cincinnati
and
new
orleans.
the
day
before
the
discontinuance
was
to
take
effect,
the
appellants,
filed
suit
in
the
federal
court
in
chicago
and
obtained
the
temporary
restraining
order
which
restraining
order
remained
in
effect
for
a
period
of
nine
months
after
the
date
that
the
l
&
n
filed
its
notice
to
discontinue
the
trains.
congress
set
the
period
at
five
months
as
a
maximum.
and
yet,
here
the
l
&
n
was
operating
a
train
that
was
losing
money
at
the
rate
of
a
million
dollars
a
year
for
an
additional
period
time
without
any
protection
of
the
bond
and
i
there
say
that
if
this
court
had
granted
a
stay
at
the
district
court's
order
then
we
would
still
be
operating
it.we
would
be
losing
at
the
rate
of
a
million
and
a
half
dollars
would
have
lost
it,
at
least
a
million
and
a
half
dollars
by
now
and
the
continuing
to
operate
until
further
order
of
the
court.
i
would
certainly
don't
think
that
there's
any
consistency
between
the
intention
of
congress
in
enacting
and
putting
on
a
maximum
five
months
statutory
suspension
period
and
the
concept
to
judicial
review
where
railroads
are
frequently
faced
with
temporary
restraining
orders
where
bonds
are
not
given
for
the
adequate
protection
of
any
damages
that
might
be
given.
i
might
want
to
say
one
more
thing
if
your
honors
please
with
respect
to
the
los
angeles
case.
as
this
court
held
in
that
proceeding
that
there
are
so-called
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
are
not
subject
to
judicial
review,
with
respect
to
the
discontinuance
of
a
proceeding
under
section
13
(a)
(1)
that
commission
does
characterized
its
discontinuance
as
an
order.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
they
should
characterize
it
as
an
order
and
in
fact
it's
nothing
more
that
a
notice
to
the
parties
and
if
anything
a
housekeeping
order.
it
is
not
an
order
ordering
anybody
to
do
anything
in
this
case.
and
under
those
circumstances,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
of
los
angeles
is
in
effect
apposite
to
this
point.
and
what
is
--
what
the
commission
has
simply
done
in
issuing
its
so-called
order
of
noticing
discontinuance,
it
is
merely
the
statement
of
the
results
of
its
investigation.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
james
w.
hoeland
the
statute
requires
that
the
--
well,
let's
put
in
the
other
way.
it
says
if
the
commission
finds
that
continued
operation
is
required
to
issue
an
order
requiring
continued
operation,
but
the
commission
has
always
held
that
the
opposite
applies
that
once
they
enter
an
investigation,
once
they
hold
hearings,
that
they
have
to
make
findings.
findings
as
to
whether
the
trains
are
required
by
public
convenience
necessity
whether
they're
not.
and
that
decision
is
the
great
northern
decision
reported
at
307
icc.
and
also
the,
as
i
said
section
14
(a)
requires
findings
and
a
report
and
i
think
also
the
administrative
procedure
act
requires
it
in
any
investigation.
