justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
can't
even
though
you
discontinue
it?
even
though
you
don't
follow
through
but
just
as
you
did
here
as
i
understand
it,
didn't
you?
enter
an
order
of
this
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
second
page
mr.
shapiro?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh!
you
have
to
go
right
through
it.
can't
you
stop
it
in
the
middle?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
you
did
then
the
railroad
simply
discontinue
the
challenge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
maybe
there
may
be
some
other
situations
besides
opening
decision
to
open
the
hearing
where
review
wouldn't
be
have?
but
if
they
go
this
far,
in
any
way,
there
should
be
a
review?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
that
but
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
on
judicial
review,
of
this
order,
as
i
understand
it,
a
few
of
the
court
disagree
with
the
commission's
discontinuance
of
the
investigation.
one
is
there
left
except
that
when
it
comes
back
to
the
commission,
the
commission
orders
the
railroad
to
continue
the
service.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
all
that
will
happen.
there'll
be
no
more
hearings
or
anything.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
think
if
you
think
then
that
as
soon
as
they
started
an
investigation,
the
standards
of
the
act
take
over.
and
that
it
has
to
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest
for
the
commission
would
permit
the
change
to
be
discontinued.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although
the
act
really
puts
the
standard
on
only
in
the
event
they
want
to
order
the
trains
to
be
continued.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
tell
me
this
mr.
shapiro,
i
gather
that
congress
enacted
this
law
as
i
recall
it
out
of
some
impatience
with
the
delays
in
getting
trains
to
discontinue,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
properly
railroad
should
be
allowed
to
discontinue
service
they
were
all
tied
up
with
the
state
and
other
commission
hearings
and
everything
else,
and
sometimes
years
went
on
before
they
succeeded,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
the
congress
is
concerned.
well,
certainly,
the
statute
contemplated
some
kind
of
summary
procedure
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
it
summary
to
the
extent
if
the
commission
decides
not
to
investigate
as
i
understand
it?
what
was
held
in
the
new
jersey
case
is
sound.
namely
that's
not
judicially
reviewable.
that
ends
the
whole
business
and
the
railroad
discontinued
the
service.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
of
course
the
other
thing
is
that
you
got
only
four
months
back
when
you
do
investigate
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
only
four?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
none
of
those
things
that's
unfair,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
can't
even
though
you
discontinue
it?
even
though
you
don't
follow
through
but
just
as
you
did
here
as
i
understand
it,
didn't
you?
enter
an
order
of
this
(inaudible)?
