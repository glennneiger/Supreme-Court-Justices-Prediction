mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
for
the
appellants
and
my
argument
time
is
being
shared
by
counsel
for
the
united
states
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
because
the
government
has
aligned
itself
in
this
case
on
appellant's
side.
these
are
two
direct
appeals
from
two
cases
heard
together
by
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
the
two
cases
were
suits
to
review
the
action
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
allowing
to
be
discontinued
a
portion
of
one
passenger
train
and
all
of
another
passenger
trains.
the
partial
discontinuance
involved
the
chicago
to
evansville,
indiana
segment
of
the
georgian
train
which
operates
from
chicago
to
atlanta.
a
complete
discontinuance
was
the
hummingbird
train
which
operates
from
cincinnati
to
new
orleans.
the
interconnection
is
that
national.
the
appellants
have
a
substantial
interest
in
the
service
and
these
are
the
only
trains,
the
only
daily
trains
from
chicago
to
terre,
vincennes,
evansville,
chattanooga,
atlanta,
mobile,
and
are
the
only
daily
service
from
chicago
to
nashville
and
montgomery,
alabama.
the
court
below
dismissed
both
of
the
actions
for
lack
of
jurisdictions.
the
court
said
that
congress
intended
to
deny
judicial
review
to
the
public
because
when
the
carrier
prevails
at
the
icc,
the
order
is
one
discontinue
the
investigation.
on
the
other
hand
if
the
railroad
loses
that
the
icc,
the
order
is
one
requiring
the
continued
train
operations
and
the
railroad
can
go
to
court.
and
we
think
this
is
unfair
and
the
reason
we
think
it's
legally
unfair
is
that
congress
never
intended
the
unfair
result.
and
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
suggest
that
the
public
can't
go
to
court
but
the
railroads
can
go
to
court.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
well,
the
question
we
have
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
i
just
thought
i
mentioned
the
word
unfairness
since
it's
come
up
today.
two
of
the
lower
court
decisions
which
we
rely
on
did
use
the
word
unfair
and
said
that
congress
could
not
be
presumed
to
have
intended
such
an
unfair
result.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
the
appellants
here
today
are
seven
regulatory
commissions,
one
state,
nine
communities,
three
labor
organizations,
and
one
railroad
passenger
association.
we
are
supported
an
amicus
brief
by
the
national
association
of
regulatory
commissioners
until
the
commissioners
representing
all
of
the
state
commissions
for
the
50
states,
the
virgin
islands,
puerto
rico,
and
the
district
of
columbia.
and
the
appellees
are
the
chicago
and
east
illinois
railroad
and
the
louisville
and
nashville
railroad.
the
sole
issue
before
the
court
in
our
judgment
is
whether
congress
did
intend
to
deny
judicial
review
to
the
public
while
granting
such
judicial
review
to
the
railroads.
there's
no
question
of
standing
involved,
eight
district
courts
have
expressly
passed
upon
the
issue.
two
early
decisions
in
1965,
held
it
was
no
judicial
review
for
the
public
and
all
of
the
decisions
since
then
have
held
to
the
opposite
that
there
is
judicial
review
and
one
of
these
other
decisions
was
granted
by
a
three-judge
court
for
the
same
northern
district
of
illinois
after
the
judges
below
were
entered.
now
the
statute
we
have
here
is
section
13
(a)
(1),
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
became
a
law
in
1958.
and
contrary
to
the
opinion
below,
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
or
the
legislative
history
of
13
(a)
(1)
to
suggest
that
congress
intended
to
deny
judicial
review.
the
general
framework
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
is
that
decisions
of
the
commission
are
subject
to
judicial
review.
there's
nothing
unusual
about
an
order
discontinuing
and
investigation
at
the
commission.
this
is
what
to
do
and
virtually
all
of
the
rate
cases
and
those
decisions
have
been
subject
to
review
and
reviewed
by
this
court.
ever
since
the
rochester
decision
in
1939
and
administrative
procedure
act
in
1946,
the
commission
institutes
an
investigation
of
a
freight
rate,
the
fines
unlawful,
the
order
is
one
discontinued
investigation,
exactly
the
one
which
appellants
were
denied
judicial
review
for
here.
now
the
lower
court
based
its
--
primarily
based
its
opinion
on
the
wording
of
the
statute
and
they
said
that
where
the
railroad
files
a
notice,
and
elects
to
supersede
state
jurisdiction,
the
icc
has
authority
in
that
30-day
notice
period
to
either
institute
investigation
or
not.
it
doesn't
institute
an
investigation.
the
lower
court
felt
that
the
train
off
becomes
effective
pursuant
to
the
statute.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
i
don't
think
that
that
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
and
i
don't
think
so.
in
fact,
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
right.
in
the
new
jersey
case,
that
was
a
per
curiam
affirmance.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
well,
we
don't
first
to
answer
question,
we
don't
concede
it
and
the
government
in
its
brief
does
not
consider.
they
say
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
i
think
they
use
the
word
patent
abuse.
they
said
the
absent
patent
abuse.
there
could
be
situations
i
think
where
the
discretion
of
the
commission
is
subject
to
abuse
and
we
can
go
to
court.
the
author
of
the
opinion
in
new
jersey
below
did
recognize
such
a
situation
later.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
in
that
case,
he
was
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
that's
right
it
was
work
type.
the
next
case
that
come
along
at
200
f.
supp
where
you
had
another
type
situation.
he
did
because
there,
the
question
was
whether
the
icc
had
jurisdiction
at
all.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
and
that
case,
did
come
here,
he
reversed
on
other
grounds.
the
new
jersey
case
was
a
ferry
case.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
and
before
section
1381
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
right.
it
was
a
ferry
across
the
--
no,
it
was
a
person
of
a
ferry
from
across
the
harbor
there
and
the
commission
had
initially
before
13
(a)
(1)
was
passed
had
held
that
the
ferry
was
unwarranted.
and
that
was
offset
in
court
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
not
an
entire
abandonment
of
line.
you
could
have
at
least
scholars
across
the
harbor
or
something,
so
congress
passed
13
(a)
(1),
the
carrier
then
invoked
13
(a)
(1)
and
the
commission
declined
to
institute
an
investigation
and
in
its
notice
said
one
of
the
reasons
is
the
prior
report
the
board
investigated
this.
and
that's
the
state
of
new
jersey
case
and
i
don't
think
that
the
courts
are
precluded
from
judicial
review
in
this
30-day
period.
it
depends
on
the
abuse
of
discretion
and
there
she
could
have
a
bad
enough
case,
corruption
at
the
commission
or
something
like
that
possibly
it
had
judicial
review.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
that's
right.
this
was
given
great
weight
by
the
court
below.
they
use
this
non-reviewability
concept
based
on
state
of
new
jersey
and
said
well
since
that
--
since
the
train
would
come
off
it
the
end
of
30
days
without
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes,
because
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
right
and
i
point
out
that
section
1336
(a)
of
title
28
says
that
you
can
go
to
court
for
any
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
question
is
whether
in
order
to
discontinue
an
investigation
is
such
an
order
now.
whether
commission
doesn't
investigate
a
case,
there's
no
order.
there's
a
notice.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
order
issue.
and
that
really
is
our
case
in
a
nutshell.
the
second
reason
given
by
the
court
below
was
that
if
you
allowed
judicial
review,
you'll
have
delays.
and
there's
a
congressional
purpose
to
stop
the
delays
that
were
occurring
at
the
state
commission
level.
and
congress
set
up
a
dual
system.
most
train
of
todays
are
as
decided
not
to
cite
it
before
the
state
commissions
not
the
icc.
section
13
(a)
(1)
is
not
self-executing
statutes.
not
self-implementing
a
carrier
has
to
file
a
notice
and
that
acts
supersedes
a
state
jurisdiction.
therefore,
we
have
a
situation
where
this
statute
has
been
set
up
and
congress
answered
the
delay
problem
by
imposing
a
four-month
limitation
upon
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
that's
where
they
answer
the
delay
you
have
judicial
review
of
state
commissions
and
there's
no
reason
why
you
can't
have
judicial
review
of
icc
decisions.
the
louisville
and
nashville
on
brief
suggest
that
if
you
have
judicial
review,
you're
going
to
have
injunctions.
our
answer
to
that
is
that
that's
alright
but
that
issue
is
not
before
this
court
because
the
louisville
and
nashville
stop
the
train
at
birmingham
and
an
application
for
stay
was
denied
so
the
questions
of
injunctions
are
stays
pendente
lite
are
not
before
the
court.
now
the
sole
issue
is
whether
there
is
ultimate
judicial
review
and
as
an
important
case
to
chicago
and
the
southern
states
involved
and
to
all
the
regulatory
commissions
and
we
ask
that
the
judgments
below
be
reversed.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
i'd
like
to
just
mention
one
or
two
things.
the
first
is
that
where
the
commission
does
enter
upon
an
investigation
during
the
30
days
notice
period
and
where
it
does
issue
an
order
requiring
continued
operation
of
the
trains.
after
that
point,
the
discontinuance
of
the
trains
does
not
come
operative
pursuant
to
the
statute.
it
becomes
operative
pursuant
to
the
expiration
of
that
commission
order,
an
order
which
the
commission
determines
it
will
not
renew.
so,
if
there
is
a
commission
approval
or
disapproval
of
the
train
off
case,
once
they
enter
upon
an
investigation,
now
it's
true
that
in
the
30-day
notice
period
if
they
decide
not
to
investigate,
the
discontinuance
would
take
place
pursuant
to
the
statute.
now
that
case
is
not
before
us
today.
we're
not
rearguing
the
state
of
new
jersey
or
finding
out
what
modification
of
it
should
be
made.
the
case
we
have
here
today
is
that
the
commission
did
institute
an
investigation.
and
moreover,
they
held
hearings
and
the
statute
requires
a
hearing.
section
13
(a)
(1)
(ph)
requires
a
hearing
requires
evidence
and
requires
findings
under
section
14
(1)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
once
the
commission
enters
an
investigation,
it
has
to
make
findings
and
a
report.
and
the
last
thing
i'd
like
to
say
is
that
order
simply
discontinued
an
investigation
is
common
at
the
commission,
common.
it
hasn't
come
to
before
this
court
perhaps
to
such
a
precise
distinguishing
between
what
do
they
do
on
remand
if
they
set
aside
the
court
that
is
in
order
of
discontinuing
investigation
but
this
is
--
does
happen
behind
the
scenes
of
all
of
the
freight
rate
cases.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
for
the
appellants
and
my
argument
time
is
being
shared
by
counsel
for
the
united
states
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
because
the
government
has
aligned
itself
in
this
case
on
appellant's
side.
these
are
two
direct
appeals
from
two
cases
heard
together
by
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
the
two
cases
were
suits
to
review
the
action
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
allowing
to
be
discontinued
a
portion
of
one
passenger
train
and
all
of
another
passenger
trains.
the
partial
discontinuance
involved
the
chicago
to
evansville,
indiana
segment
of
the
georgian
train
which
operates
from
chicago
to
atlanta.
a
complete
discontinuance
was
the
hummingbird
train
which
operates
from
cincinnati
to
new
orleans.
the
interconnection
is
that
national.
the
appellants
have
a
substantial
interest
in
the
service
and
these
are
the
only
trains,
the
only
daily
trains
from
chicago
to

vincennes,
evansville,
chattanooga,
atlanta,
mobile,
and
are
the
only
daily
service
from
chicago
to
nashville
and
montgomery,
alabama.
the
court
below
dismissed
both
of
the
actions
for
lack
of
jurisdictions.
the
court
said
that
congress
intended
to
deny
judicial
review
to
the
public
because
when
the
carrier

at
the
icc,

loses
that
the
icc,
the
order
is
one
requiring
the
continued
train
operations
and
the
railroad
can
go
to
court.
and
we
think
this
is
unfair
and
the
reason
we
think
it's
legally
unfair
is
that
congress
never
intended
the
unfair
result.
and
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
suggest
that
the
public
can't
go
to
court
but
the
railroads
can
go
to
court.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
well,
the
question
we
have
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
i
just
thought
i
mentioned
the
word
unfairness
since
it's
come
up
today.
two
of
the
lower
court
decisions
which
we
rely
on
did
use
the
word
unfair
and
said
that
congress
could
not
be
presumed
to
have
intended
such
an
unfair
result.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
the
appellants
here
today
are
seven
regulatory
commissions,
one
state,
nine
communities,
three
labor
organizations,
and
one
railroad
passenger
association.
we
are
supported
an
amicus

and
the
appellees
are
the
chicago

railroad
and
the

the
sole

before

judgment
is
whether

don't
think
so.
in
fact,
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
right.
in
the
new
jersey
case,
that
was
a
per
curiam
affirmance.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
well,
we
don't
first
to
answer
question,
we
don't
concede
it
and
the
government
in
its
brief
does
not
consider.
they
say
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
i
think
they
use
the
word
patent
abuse.
they
said
the
absent
patent
abuse.
there
could
be
situations
i
think
where
the
discretion
of
the
commission
is
subject
to
abuse
and
we
can
go
to
court.
the
author
of
the
opinion
in
new
jersey
below
did
recognize
such
a
situation
later.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
in
that
case,
he
was
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
that's
right
it
was
work
type.
the
next
case
that
come
along
at
200
f.
supp
where
you
had
another
type
situation.
he
did
because
there,
the
question
was
whether
the
icc
had
jurisdiction
at
all.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
and
that
case,
did
come
here,
he
reversed
on
other
grounds.
the
new
jersey
case
was
a
ferry
case.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
and
before
section
1381
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
right.
it
was
a
ferry
across
the
--
no,
it
was
a
person
of
a
ferry
from
across
the
harbor
there
and
the
commission
had
initially
before
13
(a)
(1)
was
passed
had
held
that
the
ferry
was
unwarranted.
and
that
was
offset
in
court
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
not
an
entire
abandonment
of
line.
you
could
have
at
least
scholars
across
the
harbor
or
something,
so
congress
passed
13
(a)
(1),
the
carrier
then
invoked
13
(a)
(1)
and
the
commission
declined
to
institute
an
investigation
and
in
its
notice
said
one
of
the
reasons
is
the
prior
report
the
board
investigated
this.
and
that's
the
state
of
new
jersey
case
and
i
don't
think
that
the
courts
are
precluded
from
judicial
review
in
this
30-day
period.
it
depends
on
the
abuse
of
discretion
and
there
she
could
have
a
bad
enough
case,
corruption
at
the
commission
or
something
like
that
possibly
it
had
judicial
review.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
that's
right.
this
was
given
great
weight
by
the
court
below.
they
use
this
non-reviewability
concept
based
on
state
of
new
jersey
and
said
well
since
that
--
since
the
train
would
come
off
it
the
end
of
30
days
without
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes,
because
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
right
and
i
point
out
that
section
1336
(a)
of
title
28
says
that
you
can
go
to
court
for
any
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
question
is
whether
in
order
to
discontinue
an
investigation
is
such
an
order
now.
whether
commission
doesn't
investigate
a
case,
there's
no
order.
there's
a
notice.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
order
issue.
and
that
really
is
our
case
in
a
nutshell.
the
second
reason
given
by
the
court
below
was
that
if
you
allowed
judicial
review,
you'll
have
delays.
and
there's
a
congressional
purpose
to
stop
the
delays
that
were
occurring
at
the
state
commission
level.
and
congress
set
up
a
dual
system.
most
train
of
todays
are
as
decided
not
to
cite
it
before
the
state
commissions
not
the
icc.
section
13
(a)
(1)
is
not
self-executing
statutes.
not
self-implementing
a
carrier
has
to
file
a
notice
and
that
acts
supersedes
a
state
jurisdiction.
therefore,
we
have
a
situation
where
this
statute
has
been
set
up
and
congress
answered
the
delay
problem
by
imposing
a
four-month
limitation
upon
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
that's
where
they
answer
the
delay
you
have
judicial
review
of
state
commissions
and
there's
no
reason
why
you
can't
have
judicial
review
of
icc
decisions.
the
louisville
and
nashville
on
brief
suggest
that
if
you
have
judicial
review,
you're
going
to
have
injunctions.
our
answer
to
that
is
that
that's
alright
but
that
issue
is
not
before
this
court
because
the
louisville
and
nashville
stop
the
train
at
birmingham
and
an
application
for
stay
was
denied
so
the
questions
of
injunctions
are
stays
pendente
lite
are
not
before
the
court.
now
the
sole
issue
is
whether
there
is
ultimate
judicial
review
and
as
an
important
case
to
chicago
and
the
southern
states
involved
and
to
all
the
regulatory
commissions
and
we
ask
that
the
judgments
below
be
reversed.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
i'd
like
to
just
mention
one
or
two
things.
the
first
is
that
where
the
commission
does
enter
upon
an
investigation
during
the
30
days
notice
period
and
where
it
does
issue
an
order
requiring
continued
operation
of
the
trains.
after
that
point,
the
discontinuance
of
the
trains
does
not
come
operative
pursuant
to
the
statute.
it
becomes
operative
pursuant
to
the
expiration
of
that
commission
order,
an
order
which
the
commission
determines
it
will
not
renew.
so,
if
there
is
a
commission
approval
or
disapproval
of
the
train
off
case,
once
they
enter
upon
an
investigation,
now
it's
true
that
in
the
30-day
notice
period
if
they
decide
not
to
investigate,
the
discontinuance
would
take
place
pursuant
to
the
statute.
now
that
case
is
not
before
us
today.
we're
not
rearguing
the
state
of
new
jersey
or
finding
out
what
modification
of
it
should
be
made.
the
case
we
have
here
today
is
that
the
commission
did
institute
an
investigation.
and
moreover,
they
held
hearings
and
the
statute
requires
a
hearing.
section
13
(a)
(1)
(ph)
requires
a
hearing
requires
evidence
and
requires
findings
under
section
14
(1)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
once
the
commission
enters
an
investigation,
it
has
to
make
findings
and
a
report.
and
the
last
thing
i'd
like
to
say
is
that
order
simply
discontinued
an
investigation
is
common
at
the
commission,
common.
it
hasn't
come
to
before
this
court
perhaps
to
such
a
precise
distinguishing
between
what
do
they
do
on
remand
if
they
set
aside
the
court
that
is
in
order
of
discontinuing
investigation
but
this
is
--
does
happen
behind
the
scenes
of
all
of
the
freight
rate
cases.
