may
i
ask
you
did
the
personnel
of
the
commission
changed
from
the
time
this
case
began
until
it
ended?
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
new
commissioner,
but
he
did
not
participate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
only
change
was
that
one
during
from
the
beginning
to
the
end?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
the
way
they
divided
up
among
themselves.
you
had
a
number
of
men
on
the
commission,
members
of
the
commission.
what
was
the
difference
in
the
personnel
of
that
commission
from
the
time
this
case
began
until
it
ended?
justice
hugo
l.
black
three
different
commissioners.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
were
they
appointed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
--
they
get
them
from
--
do
you
know
whether
the
change
in
the
personnel
had
anything
to
do
with
the
judgment
that
was
finally
rendered?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
might
be
a
change
in
the
standard,
but
were
there
change
in
the
number
--
by
the
men
who
applied
for
the
standard?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not
being
close
to
a
legal
question,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
possible
to
preserve
competition
and
to
permit
merger?
justice
hugo
l.
black
preserve
it
to
the
extent
it
existed
in
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
be
a
good
thing
and
might
not
wholly
preserve
competition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
you
are
not
as
you
are
representing
department
of
justice,
finding
it
on
the
basis
that's
its
bad
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
suppose
you
as
representative
of
the
department
of
justice
opposing
this
on
the
basis
that
the
whole
merger,
all
those
railroads
and
all
that
part
of
the
united
states
was
a
bad
thing
or
a
good
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
does
that
appear,
do
you
have
it
--
convenient?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
that
decree
rendered?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
challenging
it
or
standing
on
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
challenging
or
standing
on
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
the
1896
decree?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can't
quite
understand
this
question.
what
you
are
raising
is,
isn't
it
a
question
of
ownership
as
between
the
old
railway
and
the
railroad?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
say
that
--
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
in
the
right-of-way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
you
are
right,
and
they
merged,
would
you
apply
to
loose
if
he
did
own
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
that
would
do
is
just
really
knock
up
the
whole
thing,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
nothing
to
merge,
suppose
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
i
judged
it
was.[laughter]
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
a
lawsuit
outside
of
this
one,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
commission
has
made
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
difference
would
it
make?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
difference
would
it
make,
who
owns
it,
if
it's
only
a
question
of
merging?
you
are
here
as
an
intervener.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
difference
would
it
make?
why
couldn't
they
merge
if
it
was
owned
by
one
group
same
as
it
was
owned
by
another
group?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
see,
you
claim
that's
an
insuperable
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
any
merger
now
or
hereafter.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
they
have
been
mortgage
all
through
the
last
century.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
that
finding
made?
before
the

or
--?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
it
find
on
that
subject
in
the
first
place?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
great
a
difference
in
the
amount
of
savings.
justice
