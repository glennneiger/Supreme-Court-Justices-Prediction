justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
see
the
green
one,
neither
the
green
nor
the
red
one
is
to
come
in
to
duluth
on
my
map.
justice
potter
stewart
not
this
one?
justice
potter
stewart
those
--
just
a
simple
black
lines
are
part
of
the
same
system,
branch
lines
of
the
great
northern
and
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
correct
in
remembering
that
at
the
time
of
the
first
report
only
three
of
the
six
conditions
had
been
accorded
to
the
milwaukee
road?
justice
potter
stewart
and
assuming
all
of
them?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
also
--
would
it
be
correct
to
say
that
they
took
a
different
view
of
the
meaning
of
section
5
in
their
second
report?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know.
justice
potter
stewart
both
sides
in
both
reports?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
referring
to
cases
like
that,
maritime
commission
case,
svenska
or
whatever
it
is.
justice
potter
stewart
well
there
were
changes
in
the
facts
between
the
first
and
second
report,
aren't
there
--
weren't
there?
in
other
words
although
you
disagree
that
with
the
suggestion
in
the
question
of
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
commission
in
fact
applied
the
same
basic
standard
in
each
case
but
came
out
differently.
at
least
i
would
suppose
if
there
were
changes
in
the
facts
as
i
understand
there
were
that
it
would
been
--
would've
been
quite
possible
for
the
same
commission
to
apply
the
same
standards
and
come
out
differently
and
the
changes
to
which
i
refer
are
first
of
all
the
petition
by
these
applicants
which
led
to
the
second
report
accepting
every
single
one
of
the
conditions
affecting
the
milwaukee,
every
single
one
of
the
conditions
affecting
the
chicago
and
northwestern
agreeing
fully
to
enter
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreements
with
the
representatives
of
their
employee
to
take
care
attrition.
and
finally,
pointing
out
that
the
profits
that
would
ensue
upon
this
merger,
the
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
the
savings
that
would
ensue
upon
this
merger
were
substantially
greater
than
at
first
been
assumed.
now,
if
i'm
correct
that
these
or
any
of
these
changes
in
facts
were
evident
or
present
at
the
time
of
the
second
report,
it
would
be
quite
conceivable
that
you
could
apply
the
same
standards
and
come
out
with
a
different
result.
justice
potter
stewart
certainly
then
as
i
understood
your
answer,
there
was
at
least
one
fundamental
change
in
the
facts
between
the
first
hearing,
at
the
time
of
the
first
hearing
and
the
time
of
the
second
hearing
and
that
is
the
elimination
of
any
problem
with
respect
to
attrition
of
the
employees.
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
redemption
to
be
at
par,
$10
a
share?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
--
so
far
as
$10.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
would
mean
a
--
for
each
share
of
common
stock
would
be
$5
--
justice
potter
stewart
five
dollars
eventually.
justice
potter
stewart
$105?
justice
potter
stewart
105
percent
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
$10.
justice
potter
stewart
of
$10.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
in
other
words
--
justice
potter
stewart
$10.50.
justice
potter
stewart
before
that
1920
statute,
the
commission,
do
i
understand
it,
had
no
role
to
play
in
railroad
mergers
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
throughout
their
history?
justice
potter
stewart
did
that
case
go
beyond
the
commission?
was
there
a
judicial
review
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what,
the
access
to
billings?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
current
status
of
the
proposed
merger
between
the
milwaukee
and
the
chicago
northwestern?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
see
the
green
one,
neither
the
