mr.
valentine
b.
deale
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
livingston
anti-merger
committee
raised
these
two
thresholds
issues
in
these
consolidated
cases.
the
first
issue
is
the
issue
of
a
jurisdiction
of
whether
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
jurisdiction
over
the
proposed
merger.
the
second
issue
is
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
proposed
merger
is
barred
by
a
statutory
law
in
contract.
the
commission's
position
also
embraces
the
contention
that
neither
the
court
below
nor
the
commission
gave
adequate
consideration
to
these
two
primary
issues.
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
is
a
twin
issue.
it
is
an
issue
of
jurisdiction
and
ownership.
in
terms
of
the
committee's
position,
the
commission
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
the
proposed
merger
since
one
of
the
central
properties
in
the
merger
namely
the
main
line
right-of-way
used
and
operated
by
northern
pacific
railway
company
is
neither
owned
by
a
merger
applicant
nor
owned
by
a
petitioner
for
inclusion
in
the
merger.
putting
it
another
way,
it's
the
committee's
position
that
the
ownership
of
the
main
line
right-of-way
continues
to
vest
in
the
federally,
in
the
federal
chartered
company,
namely
northern
pacific
railroad,
an
existing
federal
company
controlled
to
be
sure
by
railway.
the
merger
authorization
authority
of
the
commission
has
boundaries
and
it's
our
position
that
these
boundaries
have
not
been
heeded
by
the
commission.
not
just
any
merger
maybe
approved
by
the
commission.
the
kind
of
a
merger
that
maybe
approved
by
the
commission
is
a
merger
where
the
properties
to
be
merged
are
owned
by
the
merger
applicant.
and
in
the
case
of
the
rail
merger,
the
properties
may
also
be
owned
by
a
petitioner
for
inclusion
in
the
merger.
the
law
makes
no
provision
for
the
merger
of
properties
owned
by
someone
else.
thus,
involuntary
mergers
are
outside
the
scope
of
the
present
law.
now,
complementing
these
boundaries
upon
the
commission's
authority
is
section
5
(2)
(b)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
specifies
that
before
the
commission
may
exercise
its
authority,
it
must
find
that
the
proposed
transaction
is
within
the
scope
of
the
act.
in
other
words,
in
this
case,
that
the
rail
merger
is
a
merger,
the
properties
of
which
are
owned
either
by
an
applicant
or
by
a
petitioner
for
including,
for
inclusion
in
the
merger.
now,
on
the
merits
of
the
issue
of
who
owns
of
the
main
line
right-of-way
used
and
operated
by
northern
pacific
railway
company
since
1896,
the
commission's
--
the
committee's
position
is
this.
first,
we
want
to
draw
the
distinction
between
the
main
line
right-of-way
with
its
franchise
in
federal
tax
exemption
between
that
properties
or
those
properties
and
other
properties
of
railways
such
as
land
grant
lands.
the
properties
of
a
federally
chartered
main
line
right-of-way
with
its
franchise
and
tax
exemption
privilege,
that
property
has
a
quality
of
inalienability.
the
company
which
receives
such
property
from
congress,
from
the
united
states
government
may
not,
may
not
transfer
it
voluntarily
except
on
the
authority
of
congress.
it
is
our
position
that
congress
never
enacted
the
necessary
concept
legislation
to
transfer
title
of
the
main
line
right-of-way
with
the
franchise
and
tax
exemption
privilege
from
railroad
to
railway.
now,
contrary
to
the
position
of
railway
which
has
been
uncritically
accepted
by
the
commission,
the
resolution
of
may
31,
1870
was
no
consent
to
the
purported
transfer
from
railroad,
the
federally
chartered
company,
to
railway.
the
joint
resolution
of
1870
authorized
railroad
to
issue
bonds
in
aid
of
construction
and
it
also
authorized
railroad
to
place
a
mortgage
to
secure
these
bonds
on
railroad's
properties.
shortly
thereafter,
within
two
months
thereafter
in
fact,
a
mortgage
--
bonds
were
indeed
issued
and
mortgages
were
placed
--
a
mortgage
was
placed
on
railroads
property.
subsequently,
there
was
default
and
the
committee
of
bondholders
had
a
foreclosure
sale
bought
in
the
property.
later
on,
the
property
was
re-conveyed
to
the
railroad
company.
subsequently,
other
mortgages,
other
bonds
were
issued
and
other
mortgages
were
placed
on
the
properties.
three
of
these
mortgages
were
involved
in
the
so-called
foreclosure
sale
of
1896.
and
it
is
from
this
sale
that
railway
claims
good
title
to
the
property
of
the
main
line
right-of-way.
now,
this
foreclosure
sale
was
analyzed
in
the
boyd
case
by
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
circuit
court.
in
that
case,
an
asinine
of
a
remote
creditor
of
railroad
sought
to
enforce
his
rights
against
railway
as
a
successor
to
railroad.
railway
defended
on
the
basis
that
his
rights,
the
creditor's
rights,
had
been
wiped
out
by
the
foreclosure
and
the
foreclosure
sale.
all
three
courts
agreed
that
railroad's
creditor
should
prevail
and
their
basic
reason
was
that
the
foreclosure
proceeding,
the
foreclosure,
the
foreclosure
sale
was
one
of
form
and
not
of
substance.
the
facts
of
the
transaction
as
provided
in
the
cases
and
noted
in
the
committee's
brief
bear
out
this
conclusion.
in
effect,
the
stockholders
and
bondholders
engaged
in
a
private
agreement
to
effectuate
a
transfer
of
title
of
railways
--
railroads
property,
a
federal
chartered
company
to
railway
which
at
that
time
was
nothing,
but
a
paper
corporation.
by
no
standard
of
law
could
this
be
done
in
view
of
the
inalienability
of
the
kind
of
the
property
we're
talking
about.
and
certainly,
the
capacity
for
these
private
individuals
to
work
out
this
sort
of
an
arrangement
was
not
enlarged
by
the
mere
fact
of
their
use
of
a
judicial
forum
which
in
this
case
was
a
consent
foreclosure
decree
of
the
shadowy
character
for
this
foreclosure.
in
this
foreclosure
sale
is
further
indicated
by
the
fact
that
the
very
court
which
issued
the
foreclosure
--
and
which
issued
the
foreclosure
decree
made
a
reservation
in
its
foreclosure
decree
of
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
mortgages
being
foreclosed
and
this
question
was
raised
by
one
of
the
intervening
parties
in
the
foreclosure,
in
the
foreclosure
proceeding.
and
this
reservation
of
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
mortgage
being
foreclosed
was
carried
out
not
only
in
the
decree,
in
the
master
sale
and
the
court
order
confirming
the
master
sale
and
subsequently
in
the
deeds
of
conveyance.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
in
1896.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
our
standing
--
we're
challenging
the
decree.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
this
is
correct,
mr.
justice
black.
it
is
suggested
here
that
if
the
courts
in
the
boyd
case
for
the
benefit
of
an
asinine
of
a
remote
creditor
can
cut
through
the
judicial
tracking
of
a
consent
foreclosure
decree
for
the
benefit
of
such
a
creditor.
surely,
the
same
can
be
done
when
we
talked
about
the
rights
of
the
public
interest
and
welfare
which
the
charters
--
which
the
charter
provisions
were
designed
to
secure.
now,
railway
itself
at
the
time
of
the
foreclosure
proceeding
recognized
that
support
of
legislation
was
necessary
in
order
to
affect
the
transfer
of
the
railroad's
properties
to
railway
and
this
is
without
regard
mind
you,
without
regard
to
any
question
as
to
the
validity
of
the
foreclosure
decree.
congress,
nevertheless,
did
not
accede
to
railways'
wishes
and
did
not
give
the
necessary
authorization.
indeed,
congress
has
actually
left
open
this
question
of
who
has
title
to
the
right-of-way
used
and
operated
by
railway.
in
the
act
of
june
25,
1929,
this
was
an
act
which
authorized
the
united
states
to
prosecute
suits
against
the
railway
and
railroad
to
quiet
titles
owned
by
the
--
to
quiet
titles
to
land
owned
by
the
united
states
against
claims
by
a
railroad
and
railway.
and
in
that
act,
congress
provided
as
follows.
the
provisions
of
this
act
shall
be
--
shall
not
be
construed
as
affecting
the
present
title
of
northern
pacific
railroad
company
or
its
successor
the
northern
pacific
railway
company
or
any
subsidiary
of
either
or
both
in
the
right-of-way
of
said
road
or
lands
actually
used
in
good
faith
by
the
northern
pacific
railway
company
in
the
operation
of
said
road.
this
language
is
certainly
not
language
which
recognizes
any
kind
of
title
in
railway.
further,
the
issue
that
we're
raising
here
has
never
been
adjudicated
by
any
court.
to
be
sure
there
has
been
some
title
language
that
has
been
used
in
cases,
in
the
boyd
case
particularly,
in
the
land
grant
case
and
in
the
landell
case,
but
in
none
of
those
cases
was
the
issue
in
controversy.
in
the
boyd
case,
as
we
pointed
out,
was
simply
a
case
of
creditor's
rights.
in
the
land
grant
case,
the
enabling
statute
specifically
excluded
the
question
of
title
to
railways'
right-of-way.
and
in
the
landell
case,
minority
stockholders
attempted
to
raise
this
issue,
but
they
were
foreclosed
from
doing
so
by
a
summary
judgment
of
the
court
on
the
basis
of
latches.
now,
the
circuit
threshold
issue
which
the
livingston
anti-merger
committee
is
raising
is
independent
of
this
jurisdictional
ownership
issue.
the
committee's
position
is
that
when
railway
--
taking
railway's
position
that
it
succeeded
to
railroad
and
to
the
right-of-way
of
railroad,
it
succeeded
to
railroad
with
all
the
burden
and
the
liabilities
and
obligations
that
were
attached
to
the
federal
charter.
when
congress
granted
railroad
a
400-foot
wide,
21,000-mile
long
right-of-way,
it
did
so
together
with
40
million
acres
of
land.
it
understandably
included,
in
the
federal
charter,
protective
provisions
to
assure
that
in
perpetuity,
this
national
highway
would
be
maintained
as
a
continuous
line
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
interest
and
welfare
and
also
to
serve
certain
governmental
services.
now,
two
of
these
protective
provisions
are
these.
one,
there
is
a
prohibition
against
merger
of
this
road;
secondly,
there
is
a
prohibition
against
placing
on
the
road,
any
lien
or
mortgage.
these
protective
provisions,
we
submit
run
with
the
road.
they
are
more
than
merely
personal
limitations
upon
the
original
federal
grantee.
now,
in
opposing
this
view,
railway
has
noted
that
it
has
placed,
indeed
has
placed
several
mortgages
on
the
properties
without
congressional
consent.
the
implication
is
that
another
mortgage
which
is
called
for
by
this
merger
would
be
alright.
now,
there
is
ample
authority
in
case
law
from
this
court
to
support
the
proposition
that
the
continuance
of
an
unauthorized
act
does
not
make
it
right
or
that
the
lack
of
an
enforcement
of
a
statutory
provision
does
not
affect
any
appeal.
railway
further
suggests
and
the
commission
seems
to
go
along
with
the
contention
that
the
plenary
authority
of
the
commission
to
approve
mergers
is
enough
to
sweep
away
the
protective
provisions
of
the
federal
charter.
there
are
three
reasons
why
this
view
was
unsound.
first,
it
is
too
much
to
suppose
that
the
general
language
describing
the
commission's
plenary
authority
with
respect
to
mergers
overrides
a
particular
right
which
congress
reserved
onto
itself
in
a
railroad
federal
charter.
this
is
especially
so,
since
both
before
and
after
congress
has
granted
the
commission
of
authority
to
approve
mergers,
congress
reaffirmed
its
reservation
of
rights
to
alter,
amend
or
repeal
the
federal
charter.
congress
in
effect,
has
preempted
the
provisions
of
the
federal
charter.
now,
there's
precedent
for
this
conclusion.
this
conclusion
indeed
had
been
confer
--
had
been
concordant
by
the
department
of
justice,
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
by
the
congress.
and
i
refer
to
the
texas
and
pacific
case
which
is
outlined
in
the
committee's
brief
on
pages
46
to
49.
in
this
case,
a
federally
chartered
company,
texas
and
pacific
railway
company
had
burdens
in
its
charter
which
it
wanted
to
get
rid
off.
one
of
the
burdens
was
a
limitation
upon
consolidation.
another
burden
was
a
limitation
upon
the
financial
structure
of
the
company.
so,
how
did
it
go
about
getting
rid
of
these
burdens?
it
went
to
the
congress
and
asked
the
congress
to
amend
its
federal
charter
and
in
the
course
of
the
legislative
process,
again,
the
department
of
justice,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
congress
all
agreed
that
the
legislative
route
was
the
correct
one.
now,
there
is
a
further
point.
however,
the
authority
of
the
commission
to
approve
mergers
may
be
interpreted.
it
is
not
sufficient
to
abrogate
a
statutory
contract
made
between
the
united
states
and
the
organizers,
the
northern
pacific
railroad
company
and
their
successors
and
assigns.
this
contract
which
was
consummated
upon
delivery
of
its
acceptance
to
president
lincoln
on
december
29,
1864,
provided
for
a
method
of
amendment
by
the
congressional
action.
accordingly,
if
the
terms
of
the
contract
are
not
satisfactory
to
the
parties,
the
approach
is
to
amend
the
contract
and
amendment
of
the
contract
is
provided
for
by
the
terms
of
the
contract
and
the
terms
of
the
contracts
spell
out
that
congress
has
reserved
its
rights
to
alter,
amend,
or
repeal
the
contract.
and
it
is
submitted
therefore
that
under
these
terms,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
no
right
to
abrogate
the
terms
of
the
contract
and
has
no
position
to
repudiate
its
terms
by
approving
a
proposed
merger
which
contradicts
the
terms
of
the
contract.
now,
in
summary,
railroad
officials,
or
railway
officials
themselves
have
recognized
that
what
we're
saying
here
that
railway,
if
it
did
indeed
take
railroad's
main
line
right-of-way,
it
took
it
(inaudible).
in
the
hearings
before
the
joint
congressional
committee
on
the
investigation
of
the
northern
pacific
railroad
land
grants,
railway
officials
recognized
that
it
was
properly
subject
to
all
the
limitations
and
liabilities
and
obligations
imposed
upon
the
original
company
by
the
granting
act,
and
two
of
those
congressional
impositions,
is
one,
a
prohibition
against
merger;
and
two,
a
prohibition
against
placing
a
mortgage
or
a
lien
on
the
main
line
right-of-way
without
congressional
consent.
there
are
some
procedural
inadequacies
and
this
is
the
third
position
of
the
committee
namely,
that
the
court
below
nor
the
commission
gave
adequate
attention
to
the
foregoing
threshold
issues.
the
hearing
examiner
indeed
recited
the
contentions
of
the
committee
and
he
dismissed
them
under
--
without
merit.
but
his
evaluations
of
the
contentions
were
mere
surface
evaluations.
the
commission
had
no
independent
thoughts
of
its
own
subject.
in
other
words,
it
accepted
completely
what
the
hearing
examiners
had
to
say
about
the
subject.
the
court
below
while
recognizing
that
the
issues
that
we're
raising
are
ones
of
great
magnitude
decided
that
the
commission
really
didn't
have
to
look
into
the
issue.
nevertheless,
it
acknowledged
that
should
the
court
at
some
other
day
in
the
indefinite
future
have
occasion
to
look
into
the
issues
which
we're
raising
now
and
comes
to
another
conclusion
than
that
court
can
measure
the
impact
of
its
decision
on
the
then
status
of
the
merger.
furthermore,
the
court
below
was
completely
silent
on
the
issue
of
the
currency
of
the
congressional
impositions
in
the
federal
charter
prohibiting
merger
and
mortgage
without
congressional
consent.
in
summary,
the
commission
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
the
proposed
merger
because
ownership
in
the
federally
chartered
right-of-way
continues
to
vest
in
railroad
which
is
neither
a
merger
applicant
nor
a
third
party
petitioning
for
inclusion
in
the
merger.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
that's
correct,
in
the
right-of-way.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
in
the
right-of-way.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
yes.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
the
position
is
this.
if
railroad
does
own
the
main
line
right-of-way
then
clearly
the
provisions
of
the
federal
charter,
prohibiting
merger
and
the
provisions
of
the
federal
charter
prohibiting
a
mortgage
and
a
lien
on
the
line
without
congressional
consent,
are
applicable
--
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
that
certainly
would
and
that
of
course
--
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
there
could
be
--
in
the
courts,
mr.
justice
black,
you
must
realized
that
the
livingston
anti-merger
committee
is
against
the
merger.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
in
brief
--
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
well,
mr.
justice
black,
the
commission
indeed
has
made
this
point
and
in
judicial
appeal.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
and
the
commission
has
made
the
point,
it
has
suggested
the
point
that
you're
making
and
i
would
first
like
to
suggest
that
we
directed
our
attention
to
this
issue
in
the
first
ten
pages
of
our
reply
brief,
but
for
the
present
in
reply
to
your
question,
i
would
suggest
this.
that
the
commission
and
that
the
committee,
the
livingston
anti-merger
committee
does
have
standing
in
the
proceedings.
and
having
standing
in
the
proceedings,
it
does
have
the
right
to
raise
a
jurisdictional
question
and
we're
suggesting
that
title
is
intimately
involved
with
the
question
of
the
commission's
jurisdiction.
furthermore,
by
virtue
of
decisions
of
--
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
--
by
virtue
of
--
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
--
decisions
of
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
yes
sir.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
well,
were
--
we
fall
back
mr.
justice
black
to
the
provisions
of
the
federal
charter
and
the
applicability
of
the
provisions
of
the
federal
charter.
now,
the
federal
charter
would
prohibit
a
merger.
the
federal
charter
provides
the
railroad
may
--
that
another
road
may
be
merged
into
railroad.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
it
doesn't
--
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
this
--
and
so
long
as
the
federal
charter
remains
effective,
i
must
--
there's
one
other
and
there's
a
corollary
point
here
and
that
is
that
the
federal
charter
also
prohibits
the
placement
of
a
mortgage
or
lien
on
the
road
without
congressional
consent
and
there
has
been
no
congressional
consent
to
the
proposed
mortgage
on
these
(voice
overlap).
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
there
had
been
many
mortgages
on
the
road
and
again
as
we
suggest,
some
of
them
have
been
authorized
and
we're
also
suggesting
that
some
of
them
have
not
been
authorized.
it
see
my
time
up,
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
livingston
anti-merger
committee
raised
these
two
thresholds
issues
in
these
consolidated
cases.
the
first
issue
is
the
issue
of
a
jurisdiction
of
whether
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
jurisdiction
over
the
proposed
merger.
the
second
issue
is
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
proposed
merger
is
barred
by
a
statutory
law
in
contract.
the
commission's
position
also
embraces
the
contention
that
neither
the
court
below
nor
the
commission
gave
adequate
consideration
to
these
two
primary
issues.
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
is
a
twin
issue.
it
is
an
issue
of
jurisdiction
and
ownership.
in
terms
of
the
committee's
position,
the
commission
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
the
proposed
merger
since
one
of
the
central
properties
in
the
merger
namely
the
main
line
right-of-way
used
and
operated
by
northern
pacific
railway
company
is
neither
owned
by
a
merger
applicant
nor
owned
by
a
petitioner
for
inclusion
in
the
merger.
putting
it
another
way,
it's
the
committee's
position
that
the
ownership
of
the
main
line
right-of-way
continues
to
vest
in
the
federally,
in
the
federal
chartered
company,
namely
northern
pacific
railroad,
an
existing
federal
company
controlled
to
be
sure
by
railway.
the
merger
authorization
authority
of
the
commission
has
boundaries
and
it's
our
position
that
these
boundaries
have
not
been
heeded
by
the
commission.
not
just
any
merger
maybe
approved
by
the
commission.
the
kind
of
a
merger
that
maybe
approved
by
the
commission
is
a
merger
where
the
properties
to
be
merged
are
owned
by
the
merger
applicant.
and
in
the
case
of
the
rail
merger,
the
properties
may
also
be
owned
by
a
petitioner
for
inclusion
in
the
merger.
the
law
makes
no
provision
for
the
merger
of
properties
owned
by
someone
else.
thus,
involuntary
mergers
are
outside
the
scope
of
the
present
law.
now,
complementing
these
boundaries
upon
the
commission's
authority
is
section
5
(2)
(b)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
specifies
that
before
the
commission
may
exercise
its
authority,
it
must
find
that
the
proposed
transaction
is
within
the
scope
of
the
act.
in
other
words,
in
this
case,
that
the
rail
merger
is
a
merger,
the
properties
of
which
are
owned
either
by
an
applicant
or
by
a
petitioner
for
including,
for
inclusion
in
the
merger.
now,
on
the
merits
of
the
issue
of
who
owns
of
the
main
line
right-of-way
used
and
operated
by
northern
pacific
railway
company
since
1896,
the
commission's
--
the
committee's
position
is
this.
first,
we
want
to
draw
the
distinction
between
the
main
line
right-of-way
with
its
franchise
in
federal
tax
exemption
between
that
properties
or
those
properties
and
other
properties
of
railways
such
as
land
grant
lands.
the
properties
of
a
federally
chartered
main
line
right-of-way
with
its
franchise
and
tax
exemption
privilege,
that
property
has
a
quality
of
inalienability.
the
company
which
receives
such
property
from
congress,
from
the
united
states
government
may
not,
may
not
transfer
it
voluntarily
except
on
the
authority
of
congress.
it
is
our
position
that
congress
never
enacted
the
necessary
concept
legislation
to
transfer
title
of
the
main
line
right-of-way
with
the
franchise
and
tax
exemption
privilege
from
railroad
to
railway.
now,
contrary
to
the
position
of
railway
which
has
been
uncritically
accepted
by
the
commission,
the
resolution
of
may
31,
1870
was
no
consent
to
the
purported
transfer
from
railroad,
the
federally
chartered
company,
to
railway.
the
joint
resolution
of
1870
authorized
railroad
to
issue
bonds
in
aid
of
construction
and
it
also
authorized
railroad
to
place
a
mortgage
to
secure
these
bonds
on
railroad's
properties.
shortly
thereafter,
within
two
months
thereafter
in
fact,
a
mortgage
--
bonds
were
indeed
issued
and
mortgages
were
placed
--
a
mortgage
was
placed
on
railroads
property.
subsequently,
there
was
default
and
the
committee
of
bondholders
had
a
foreclosure
sale
bought
in
the
property.
later
on,
the
property
was
re-conveyed
to
the
railroad
company.
subsequently,
other
mortgages,
other
bonds
were
issued
and
other
mortgages
were
placed
on
the
properties.
three
of
these
mortgages
were
involved
in
the
so-called
foreclosure
sale
of
1896.
and
it
is
from
this
sale
that
railway
claims
good
title
to
the
property
of
the
main
line
right-of-way.
now,
this
foreclosure
sale
was
analyzed
in
the
boyd
case
by
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
circuit
court.
in
that
case,
an
asinine
of
a
remote
creditor
of
railroad
sought
to
enforce
his
rights
against
railway
as
a
successor
to
railroad.
railway
defended
on
the
basis
that
his
rights,
the
creditor's
rights,
had
been
wiped
out
by
the
foreclosure
and
the
foreclosure
sale.
all
three
courts
agreed
that
railroad's
creditor
should
prevail
and
their
basic
reason
was
that
the
foreclosure
proceeding,
the
foreclosure,
the
foreclosure
sale
was
one
of
form
and
not
of
substance.
the
facts
of
the
transaction
as
provided
in
the
cases
and
noted
in
the
committee's
brief
bear
out
this
conclusion.
in
effect,
the
stockholders
and
bondholders
engaged
in
a
private
agreement
to
effectuate
a
transfer
of
title
of
railways
--
railroads
property,
a
federal
chartered
company
to
railway
which
at
that
time
was
nothing,
but
a
paper
corporation.
by
no
standard
of
law
could
this
be
done
in
view
of
the
inalienability
of
the
kind
of
the
property
we're
talking
about.
and
certainly,
the
capacity
for
these
private
individuals
to
work
out
this
sort
of
an
arrangement
was
not
enlarged
by
the
mere
fact
of
their
use
of
a
judicial
forum
which
in
this
case
was
a
consent
foreclosure
decree
of
the
shadowy
character
for
this
foreclosure.
in
this
foreclosure
sale
is
further
indicated
by
the
fact
that
the
very
court
which
issued
the
foreclosure
--
and
which
issued
the
foreclosure
decree
made
a
reservation
in
its
foreclosure
decree
of
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
mortgages
being
foreclosed
and
this
question
was
raised
by
one
of
the
intervening
parties
in
the
foreclosure,
in
the
foreclosure
proceeding.
and
this
reservation
of
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
mortgage
being
foreclosed
was
carried
out
not
only
in
the
decree,
in
the
master
sale
and
the
court
order
confirming
the
master
sale
and
subsequently
in
the
deeds
of
conveyance.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
in
1896.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
our
standing
--
we're
challenging
the
decree.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
this
is
correct,
mr.
justice
black.
it
is
suggested
here
that
if
the
courts
in
the
boyd
case
for
the
benefit
of
an
asinine
of
a
remote
creditor
can
cut
through
the
judicial
tracking
of
a
consent
foreclosure
decree
for
the
benefit
of
such
a
creditor.
surely,
the
same
can
be
done
when
we
talked
about
the
rights
of
the
public
interest
and
welfare
which
the
charters
--
which
the
charter
provisions
were
designed
to
secure.
now,
railway
itself
at
the
time
of
the
foreclosure
proceeding
recognized
that
support
of
legislation
was
necessary
in
order
to
affect
the
transfer
of
the
railroad's
properties
to
railway
and
this
is
without
regard
mind
you,
without
regard
to
any
question
as
to
the
validity
of
the
foreclosure
decree.
congress,
nevertheless,
did
not
accede
to
railways'
wishes
and
did
not
give
the
necessary
authorization.
indeed,
congress
has
actually
left
open
this
question
of
who
has
title
to
the
right-of-way
used
and
operated
by
railway.
in
the
act
of
june
25,
1929,
this
was
an
act
which
authorized
the
united
states
to
prosecute
suits
against
the
railway
and
railroad
to
quiet
titles
owned
by
the
--
to
quiet
titles
to
land
owned
by
the
united
states
against
claims
by
a
railroad
and
railway.
and
in
that
act,
congress
provided
as
follows.
the
provisions
of
this
act
shall
be
--
shall
not
be
construed
as
affecting
the
present
title
of
northern
pacific
railroad
company
or
its
successor
the
northern
pacific
railway
company
or
any
subsidiary
of
either
or
both
in
the
right-of-way
of
said
road
or
lands
actually
used
in
good
faith
by
the
northern
pacific
railway
company
in
the
operation
of
said
road.
this
language
is
certainly
not
language
which
recognizes
any
kind
of
title
in
railway.
further,
the
issue
that
we're
raising
here
has
never
been
adjudicated
by
any
court.
to
be
sure
there
has
been
some
title
language
that
has
been
used
in
cases,
in
the
boyd
case
particularly,
in
the
land
grant
case
and
in
the
landell
case,
but
in
none
of
those
cases
was
the
issue
in
controversy.
in
the
boyd
case,
as
we
pointed
out,
was
simply
a
case
of
creditor's
rights.
in
the
land
grant
case,
the
enabling
statute
specifically
excluded
the
question
of
title
to
railways'
right-of-way.
and
in
the
landell
case,
minority
stockholders
attempted
to
raise
this
issue,
but
they
were
foreclosed
from
doing
so
by
a
summary
judgment
of
the
court
on
the
basis
of
latches.
now,
the
circuit
threshold
issue
which
the
livingston
anti-merger
committee
is
raising
is
independent
of
this
jurisdictional
ownership
issue.
the
committee's
position
is
that
when
railway
--
taking
railway's
position
that
it
succeeded
to
railroad
and
to
the
right-of-way
of
railroad,
it
succeeded
to
railroad
with
all
the
burden
and
the
liabilities
and
obligations
that
were
attached
to
the
federal
charter.
when
congress
granted
railroad
a
400-foot
wide,
21,000-mile
long
right-of-way,
it
did
so
together
with
40
million
acres
of
land.
it
understandably
included,
in
the
federal
charter,
protective
provisions
to
assure
that
in
perpetuity,
this
national
highway
would
be
maintained
as
a
continuous
line
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
interest
and
welfare
and
also
to
serve
certain
governmental
services.
now,
two
of
these
protective
provisions
are
these.
one,
there
is
a
prohibition
against
merger
of
this
road;
secondly,
there
is
a
prohibition
against
placing
on
the
road,
any
lien
or
mortgage.
these
protective
provisions,
we
submit
run
with
the
road.
they
are
more
than
merely
personal
limitations
upon
the
original
federal
grantee.
now,
in
opposing
this
view,
railway
has
noted
that
it
has
placed,
indeed
has
placed
several
mortgages
on
the
properties
without
congressional
consent.
the
implication
is
that
another
mortgage
which
is
called
for
by
this
merger
would
be
alright.
now,
there
is
ample
authority
in
case
law
from
this
court
to
support
the
proposition
that
the
continuance
of
an
unauthorized
act
does
not
make
it
right
or
that
the
lack
of
an
enforcement
of
a
statutory
provision
does
not
affect
any
appeal.
railway
further
suggests
and
the
commission
seems
to
go
along
with
the
contention
that
the
plenary
authority
of
the
commission
to
approve
mergers
is
enough
to
sweep
away
the
protective
provisions
of
the
federal
charter.
there
are
three
reasons
why
this
view
was
unsound.
first,
it
is
too
much
to
suppose
that
the
general
language
describing
the
commission's
plenary
authority
with
respect
to
mergers
overrides
a
particular
right
which
congress
reserved
onto
itself
in
a
railroad
federal
charter.
this
is
especially
so,
since
both
before
and
after
congress
has
granted
the
commission
of
authority
to
approve
mergers,
congress
reaffirmed
its
reservation
of
rights
to
alter,
amend
or
repeal
the
federal
charter.
congress
in
effect,
has
preempted
the
provisions
of
the
federal
charter.
now,
there's
precedent
for
this
conclusion.
this
conclusion
indeed
had
been
confer
--
had
been
concordant
by
the
department
of
justice,
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
by
the
congress.
and
i
refer
to
the
texas
and
pacific
case
which
is
outlined
in
the
committee's
brief
on
pages
46
to
49.
in
this
case,
a
federally
chartered
company,
texas
and
pacific
railway
company
had
burdens
in
its
charter
which
it
wanted
to
get
rid
off.
one
of
the
burdens
was
a
limitation
upon
consolidation.
another
burden
was
a
limitation
upon
the
financial
structure
of
the
company.
so,
how
did
it
go
about
getting
rid
of
these
burdens?
it
went
to
the
congress
and
asked
the
congress
to
amend
its
federal
charter
and
in
the
course
of
the
legislative
process,
again,
the
department
of
justice,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
congress
all
agreed
that
the
legislative
route
was
the
correct
one.
now,
there
is
a
further
point.
however,
the
authority
of
the
commission
to
approve
mergers
may
be
interpreted.
it
is
not
sufficient
to
abrogate
a
statutory
contract
made
between
the
united
states
and
the
organizers,
the
northern
pacific
railroad
company
and
their
successors
and
assigns.
this
contract
which
was
consummated
upon
delivery
of
its
acceptance
to
president
lincoln
on
december
29,
1864,
provided
for
a
method
of
amendment
by
the
congressional
action.
accordingly,
if
the
terms
of
the
contract
are
not
satisfactory
to
the
parties,
the
approach
is
to
amend
the
contract
and
amendment
of
the
contract
is
provided
for
by
the
terms
of
the
contract
and
the
terms
of
the
contracts
spell
out
that
congress
has
reserved
its
rights
to
alter,
amend,
or
repeal
the
contract.
and
it
is
submitted
therefore
that
under
these
terms,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
no
right
to
abrogate
the
terms
of
the
contract
and
has
no
position
to
repudiate
its
terms
by
approving
a
proposed
merger
which
contradicts
the
terms
of
the
contract.
now,
in
summary,
railroad
officials,
or
railway
officials
themselves
have
recognized
that
what
we're
saying
here
that
railway,
if
it
did
indeed
take
railroad's
main
line
right-of-way,
it
took
it
(inaudible).
in
the
hearings
before
the
joint
congressional
committee
on
the
investigation
of
the
northern
pacific
railroad
land
grants,
railway
officials
recognized
that
it
was
properly
subject
to
all
the
limitations
and
liabilities
and
obligations
imposed
upon
the
original
company
by
the
granting
act,
and
two
of
those
congressional
impositions,
is
one,
a
prohibition
against
merger;
and
two,
a
prohibition
against
placing
a
mortgage
or
a
lien
on
the
main
line
right-of-way
without
congressional
consent.
there
are
some
procedural
inadequacies
and
this
is
the
third
position
of
the
committee
namely,
that
the
court
below
nor
the
commission
gave
adequate
attention
to
the
foregoing
threshold
issues.
the
hearing
examiner
indeed
recited
the
contentions
of
the
committee
and
he
dismissed
them
under
--
without
merit.
but
his
evaluations
of
the
contentions
were
mere
surface
evaluations.
the
commission
had
no
independent
thoughts
of
its
own
subject.
in
other
words,
it
accepted
completely
what
the
hearing
examiners
had
to
say
about
the
subject.
the
court
below
while
recognizing
that
the
issues
that
we're
raising
are
ones
of
great
magnitude
decided
that
the
commission
really
didn't
have
to
look
into
the
issue.
nevertheless,
it
acknowledged
that
should
the
court
at
some
other
day
in
the
indefinite
future
have
occasion
to
look
into
the
issues
which
we're
raising
now
and
comes
to
another
conclusion
than
that
court
can
measure
the
impact
of
its
decision
on
the
then
status
of
the
merger.
furthermore,
the
court
below
was
completely
silent
on
the
issue
of
the
currency
of
the
congressional
impositions
in
the
federal
charter
prohibiting
merger
and
mortgage
without
congressional
consent.
in
summary,
the
commission
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
the
proposed
merger
because
ownership
in
the
federally
chartered
right-of-way
continues
to
vest
in
railroad
which
is
neither
a
merger
applicant
nor
a
third
party
petitioning
for
inclusion
in
the
merger.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
that's
correct,
in
the
right-of-way.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
in
the
right-of-way.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
yes.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
the
position
is
this.
if
railroad
does
own
the
main
line
right-of-way
then
clearly
the
provisions
of
the
federal
charter,
prohibiting
merger
and
the
provisions
of
the
federal
charter
prohibiting
a
mortgage
and
a
lien
on
the
line
without
congressional
consent,
are
applicable
--
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
that
certainly
would
and
that
of
course
--
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
there
could
be
--
in
the
courts,
mr.
justice
black,
you
must
realized
that
the
livingston
anti-merger
committee
is
against
the
merger.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
in
brief
--
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
well,
mr.
justice
black,
the
commission
indeed
has
made
this
point
and
in
judicial
appeal.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
and
the
commission
has
made
the
point,
it
has
suggested
the
point
that
you're
making
and
i
would
first
like
to
suggest
that
we
directed
our
attention
to
this
issue
in
the
first
ten
pages
of
our
reply
brief,
but
for
the
present
in
reply
to
your
question,
i
would
suggest
this.
that
the
commission
and
that
the
committee,
the
livingston
anti-merger
committee
does
have
standing
in
the
proceedings.
and
having
standing
in
the
proceedings,
it
does
have
the
right
to
raise
a
jurisdictional
question
and
we're
suggesting
that
title
is
intimately
involved
with
the
question
of
the
commission's
jurisdiction.
furthermore,
by
virtue
of
decisions
of
--
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
--
by
virtue
of
--
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
--
decisions
of
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
yes
sir.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
well,
were
--
we
fall
back
mr.
justice
black
to
the
provisions
of
the
federal
charter
and
the
applicability
of
the
provisions
of
the
federal
charter.
now,
the
federal
charter
would
prohibit
a
merger.
the
federal
charter
provides
the
railroad
may
--
that
another
road
may
be
merged
into
railroad.
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
it
doesn't
--
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
this
--
and
so
long
as
the
federal
charter
remains
effective,
i
must
--
there's
one
other
and
there's
a
corollary
point
here
and
that
is
that
the
federal
charter
also
prohibits
the
placement
of
a
mortgage
or
lien
on
the
road
without
congressional
consent
and
there
has
been
no
congressional
consent
to
the
proposed
mortgage
on
these
(voice
overlap).
mr.
valentine
b.
deale
there
had
been
many
mortgages
on
the
road
and
again
as
we
suggest,
some
of
them
have
been
authorized
and
we're
also
suggesting
that
some
of
them
have
not
been
authorized.
it
see
my
time
up,
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
