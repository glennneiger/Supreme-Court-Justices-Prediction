justice
byron
r.
white
did
any
shift?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
it
wasn't
all
a
question
of
new
personnel?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
seven
members
of
this
majority
were
on
the
commission
at
the
time
of
the
first
decision,
i
gather.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
only
an
eight
man
majority,
isn't
it?
that's
an
eight
to
two?
justice
byron
r.
white
eight
to
two,
the
vote
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
one
abstaining?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
seven
of
those
--
if
one
only
new
commissioner
was
in
the
majority
on
the
last
report
that
that
seven
that
were
on
the
commission
at
the
of
the
first
two
report.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
then
you
do
concede
that
better
service
might
well
justify
an
anti
competitive
merger?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
--
so
you
would
say
not
always
even
--
you
have
to
first
find
that
there's
an
adequate
service?
justice
byron
r.
white
before
you
could
ever
justify
a
merger
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
on
service
grounds?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
better
service
is
enough.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
--
there
--
what's
wrong
here
then
is
that
the
--
that
in
your
views
that
the
commission
although
it
found
there
would
be
better
service,
didn't
make
an
express
finding
they
could
not
achieve
these
results
by
another
route?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
had
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
they
had
found
that?
that
they
couldn't
do
this
or
to
get
this
better
service
and
if
by
another
route
in
this
case,
let's
assume
the
commission
on
the
second
report
had
made
that
finding,
would
you
be
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
give
us
some
record
side
on
what's
the
--
where
in
the
first
or
second
report
the
commission
ever
said
what
standard
it
was
applying?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
have
to
read
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
read
it
out
of
what
they
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
(inaudible)
--
is
this
the
final
report?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
(inaudible)
didn't
they
say
we
give
up
on
the
part
of
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
only
represent
to
this
court
--
you
couldn't
find
it
anywhere
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
could
that
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
i
just
try
to
imagine
--
i'm
just
trying
to
imagine
with
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
one
of
them
might
be
a
failing
carrier?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
they
would
say
that
transportation
--
if
it's
improved
transportation
services
you
want,
the
law
prefers
the
competitive
way
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
of
securing
those.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
the
government's
view
might
be
that
you
just
don't
--
the
section
just
shouldn't
ever
be
held
to
apply
or
to
permit
a
merger
between
competing
carriers?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
when
they're
strong?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
any
shift?
justice
byron

you
mean
it
wasn't
