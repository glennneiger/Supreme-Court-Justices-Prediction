mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
milwaukee
feels
a
little
bit
hurt
by
the
brush
off
that
we
received
from
the
department
of
justice
as
a
weak
third
competitor
of
the
applicant
lines.
it
is
true
as
the
evidence
which
we
ourselves
put
into
the
case
demonstrates
we
are
not
as
favorably
situated
financially
as
any
of
the
applicants
as
reflected
in
that
income
working
capital
and
various
other
measures.
but
the
commission
has
not
said
we
are
not
a
good
competitor.
the
commission
in
its
first
report
which
the
department
of
justice
says
as
correctly
analyze
the
competitive
posture
of
this
case
points
out
that
we
compete
with
the
applicant
lines
in
the
11
states
that
we
provide
in
efficient
and
essential
service
in
the
areas
where
we
are
the
principle
competitors
of
the
applicants
that
the
shippers
look
to
the
milwaukee
for
active
and
vigorous
competition
both
in
rate
negotiations
and
in
quality
of
service.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
only
reference
in
this
whole
argument
to
any
improved
service
is
to
resolve
a
competition.
the
only
specific
example
has
been
that
a
faster
train
service
to
the
west
coast
which
was
a
result
of
the
milwaukee’s
competition.
for
the
department
of
justice
to
say
that
we
are
a
weak
competitor
represents
a
complete
turn
about
from
the
representations
made
by
the
department
to
the
commission.
in
its
brief
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
it
referred
to
the
acquisition
case
of
the
spokane
international
railroad
by
the
union
pacific
and
referred
to
the
court
decision
as
well
as
the
commission’s
decision
in
that
case
and
said,
this
recognition
by
the
commission
and
the
court
of
intense
competition
among
the
northern
lines
and
the
milwaukee
is
supported
by
ample
and
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
in
this
case.
meaning
the
case
before
us
today
and
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
to
support
a
contrary
finding.
the
department
went
on
and
pointed
out
that
the
milwaukee
generally
follows
the
route
of
the
northern
pacific.
it
is
a
10,596-mile
system.
milwaukee
is
in
competition
with
the
burlington
and
the
northern
lines
of
187
stations,
135
of
which
are
located
in
washington,
montana,
north
dakota
and
minnesota.
and
finally,
the
department
says,
applicants
admit
that
at
present
the
milwaukee
is
a
very
aggressive
and
effective
competitor
and
there
is
“intensive
competition”
between
them
for
the
traffic.
justice
department
went
further
and
in
their
brief
to
the
commission
pointed
out
nine
specific
representative
instances
of
how
the
milwaukee’s
active
and
vigorous
real
competition
and
independent
action
has
brought
great
advantages
to
the
public.
i
will
not
read
all
of
those
reasons,
they
appear
on
pages
140-142
of
justices’
brief
to
the
commission.
the
question
may
well
be
raised
that
we
are
such
a
good
competitor,
why
aren’t
we
rich?
or
perhaps
more
specifically,
why
is
our
share
of
the
traffic
so
small?
the
milwaukee-houston
find
to
the
area
which
in
serves
along
the
northern
interior
states
and
on
the
west
coast
principally
to
the
state
of
washington.
we
are
unable
to
serve
the
city
of
billings
which
is
the
principle
distribution
point
between
the
twin
cites
and
the
west
coast.
we
do
not
reach
portland
or
beaver
as
to
the
northern
lines
where
they
have
friendly
connections
to
work
with
for
traffic
moving
oregon
and
california.
we
do
not
have
a
fast
route
north
of
seattle
where
we
can
be
effectively
competitive
for
the
traffic
moving
to
in
and
from
canada.
and
finally,
with
the
western
injunctions,
west
to
the
twin
cites
is
closed
to
the
milwaukee
we
find
that
we
may
originate
traffic
in
the
mid-west
or
receive
traffic
from
our
connections
in
the
mid-west
and
when
we
get
as
far
as
the
twin
cities
we’re
compelled
to
turn
it
over
to
our
competitors
if
the
traffic
moves
to
a
station
local
to
our
competitors,
or
if
the
shipper
wants
our
competitors
to
have
a
line
haul.
notwithstanding
that
for
example,
a
car
going
to
vancouver-washington
could
physically
be
handled
by
the
milwaukee
all
the
way
to
tacoma,
and
then
turn
it
over
for
the
haul
beyond.
but
by
reason
of
the
rate
structure
and
the
right
which
the
northern
lines
held
under
the
law
to
protect
their
line
haul,
we
are
not
able
to
compete
for
that
traffic
for
the
long
haul.
now,
there
is
no
dissent
among
the
commissioners
in
their
first
report
that
the
milwaukee
should
have
adequate
protection.
this
was
one
thing
they
all
agreed
on,
the
six
majority
members
said
that
this
--
that
it
would
be
inconceivable
for
this
merger
to
be
approved
without
adequate
protection
for
the
milwaukee
and
five
dissenters
regretted
the
fact
that
the
commission
was
passing
up
an
opportunity
finally
to
make
the
milwaukee
complete
competitive
in
the
northern
jury
states
and
the
pacific
northwest.
with
these
conditions,
first
of
all
we’ll
be
able
to
handle
traffic
which
is
destined
to
or
from
billings,
or
which
is
to
be
stopped
off
at
billings
were
part
loading
or
part
unloading.
with
these
conditions,
we’ll
be
able
to
go
to
portland
where
the
southern
pacific
is
waiting
to
work
with
the
milwaukee
as
an
effective
route
for
traffic
to
in
and
from
the
california
and
oregon
on
the
one
hand
to
mid-west
and
the
rest
of
the
country
on
the
other
hand.
we’ll
be
able
to
participate
with
our
track
is
right
north
of
seattle
or
in
north
and
south
traffic
between
canada
and
california,
canada
and
oregon
on
an
equal
basis
with
the
northern
pacific
and
great
northern
after
they
emerged.
and
with
the
west
bound
traffic
that
we
now
handle
and
have
to
give
up
with
the
twin
cities
will
be
able
to
hold
that
traffic
and
take
it
to
our
part
of
this
junction.
our
solicitations
now
first
aren’t
all
that
important
if
a
shipper
first
is
dissatisfied
with
the
service
of
the
northern
lines
give,
or
secondly,
if
the
traffic
is
already
in
our
position
as
much
of
it
is
going
west
bound.
and
finally,
the
justice
department
again
has
conceded
that
the
milwaukee
will
be
strengthened
by
these
conditions.
the
effect
upon
the
shippers
is
been
discussed
here
by
mr.
tolan,
i
believe
that
the
purpose
of
the
antitrust
laws
is
not
so
much
to
start
out
competition
for
the
sake
of
competition
but
to
make
it
sure
that
there
will
be
a
free
flow
of
interstate
commerce
and
that
shippers
will
be
able
to
reach
their
markets
and
to
reach
their
source
of
supply
without
discrimination,
without
interference.
and
these
conditions
that
we
have
received
will
enable
milwaukee
shippers
to
do
exactly
that,
and
be
able
to
originate
a
car
on
our
railroad
and
stop
it
off
at
the
station
served
by
one
of
the
northern
lines
today
and
then
move
on
to
a
destination,
either
on
our
railroad
on
their
railroad.
these
benefits
are
important
where
the
free
flow
of
commerce
and
there
were
many,
many
shippers
of
great
size
and
importance
who
came
in
to
seek
this
opening
up
for
the
area
for
competition.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
will
open
up
competition
to
points
that
never
have
competition
before.
every
local
point
on
the
great
northern
where
the
northern
pacific
or
the
milwaukee
which
is
been
a
secret
domain
so
far
as
competition
is
concern
because
no
one
else
could
reach
it.
well,
now
we
open
for
competition
whereby
each
of
the
competing
railroads
may
so
visit
the
long
whole
of
the
traffic.
to
the
closest
junction
to
those
points
and
there
interchange
it
with
their
competitor
and
the
shipper
thereby
can
wheel
the
club
over
the
railroads
and
their
service
by
using
the
railroad
which
gives
them
the
best
service
for
the
long
haul
of
the
traffic.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
a
possibility
of
rate
competition,
yes
sir
there
is.
and
in
the
area
and
which
we
compete
we
have
given
them
quite
a
bit
of
rate
competition
and
we
find
that
in
many
instances
that
the
northern
lines
and
we
do
not
at
all
see
eye
to
eye
and
before
the
commission
and
before
the
courts
we
are
on
opposite
sides
as
we
try
to
adjust
our
rates
on
commodities
to
or
from
certain
territories.
and
the
northern
lines
have
appeared
to
protest
and
try
to
prevent
our
rate
changes
from
taking
effect.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
i
would
say
by
enlarge
that
rate
competition
is
the
more
troublesome
factor
and
the
more
likely
to
be
an
issue
between
the
railroads.
we
have
--
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
i
do
not
wish
to
indicate
that
service
is
not
important
i
believe
it
is
very
important
service.
but
i
think
that
we
find
our
disagreements
among
ourselves
and
our
attempts
to
better
our
position
manifest
itself
in
rate
adjustments
more
often
and
then
as
the
milwaukee
did
not
too
long
ago
improvement
of
a
service
in
a
very
drastic
or
substantial
manner.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
we
feel
that
it
will
tend
--
it
will
definitely
improve
our
competitive
position.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
yes
sir
and
their
merger.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
absence
of
the
conditions
of
milwaukee
took
a
very
strong
position
in
opposition
to
the
merger.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
because
the
merger
would
permit
the
improvement
of
service
by
the
northern
lines
permit
them
to
offer
their
shippers
more
than
they
can
offer
today,
permit
them
to
give
many
of
these
benefits
that
the
milwaukee’s
conditions
will
enable
the
milwaukee
to
give
it
shippers.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
if
they
were
able
to
lower
their
rates
and
justify
it
by
the
cost
of
their
handling
and
their
cost
were
lower
than
ours,
we
would
find
it
rather
difficult
to
match
their
rates.
the
suggestion
is
made
by
justice
department
that
this
relief
is
available
in
less
drastic
forms
and
a
merger
for
the
milwaukee
but
they
have
not
said
that
the
milwaukee
can
obtain
trackage
rights
to
portland,
obtain
trackage
rights
to
north
of
seattle,
and
be
kept
the
right
to
serve
billings
because
there
is
no
law
and
no
power
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
require
the
northern
lines
to
let
us
have
any
of
those
rights.
the
only
condition
that
is
possibly
obtainable
under
any
part
of
the
law
today
would
be
the
opening
of
the
western
injunctions
and
we
try
that
ones,
we
came
clear
up
to
the
supreme
court
and
although
the
justice
department
in
its
brief
to
this
court
points
its
finger
at
the
commission
and
says
they
have
done
nothing
to
help
the
milwaukee
break
the
stranglehold.
it
was
a
justice
department’s
standing
with
the
commission
who
opposed
us
all
the
way
in
the
lower
and
in
the
supreme
court
from
obtaining
that
relief.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
i
would
say
at
1955
or
1956
as
my
memory
stands
me.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
do
you
mean
sir
in
the
case
we
are
just
talking
about
where
we
attempted
to
open
the
gateway?
of
course,
at
that
time
there
was
no
proposal
to
merge
the
two
railroads
and
the
problem
in
the
law
as
it
exists
today
to
open
gateway
says,
it
must
be
shown
that
the
shipper
must
have
the
service.
and
the
law
prohibits
the
commission
from
opening
these
gateways
where
the
purpose
of
improving
the
financial
position
or
strength
of
the
carrier
who
seeks
these
gateways.
i
would
like
to
submit
to
the
court
in
the
few
minutes
remaining
that
this
is
a
situation
where
the
objectives
of
the
national
transportation
policy
and
of
antitrust
laws
in
both
be
carried
out.
there
is
no
conflict
here.
the
milwaukee
will
be
able
to
render
efficient
economic
transportation
for
its
shippers.
it
will
foster
sound
economic
conditions
for
the
milwaukee
and
it
will
be
able
to
provide
a
transportation
service
adequate
to
the
needs
of
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
postal
service
and
of
the
national
defense
in
accordance
with
the
national
transportation
policy.
at
the
same
time
the
purposes
of
the
antitrust
laws
are
frustrated
by
a
prevention
of
competition
as
much
as
by
anything
else.
and
when
a
competitor
such
as
the
milwaukee
road
is
prevented
from
competing
although
it
is
equipped
to
do
so,
the
antitrust
laws
objectives
are
especially
frustrated
and
here
with
the
conditions
to
the
milwaukee.
the
objectives
are
both
of
the
national
transportation
policy
and
the
antitrust
laws
can
be
carried
out.
and
i
would
like
in
closing
to
renew
a
promise
that
we
made
in
the
lower
court
and
that
is
that
if
this
merger
is
approved
subject
to
the
milwaukee’s
conditions.
we
promise
that
with
our
hands
is
finally
untied
so
that
we
can
physically
compete
for
traffic
over
our
line
to
and
from
washington
as
well
as
to
participate
in
traffic
to
and
from
canada,
oregon
and
california.
we
will
give
the
merge
company
and
other
competitors
such
as
the
union
pacific
and
the
canadian
pacific
who
have
profited
by
our
competitive
handcuffs
more
strong
vigorous
and
effective
competition
and
they
even
have
bargained
for?
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
milwaukee
feels
a
little
bit
hurt
by
the
brush
off
that
we
received
from
the
department
of
justice
as
a
weak
third
competitor
of
the
applicant
lines.
it
is
true
as
the
evidence
which
we
ourselves
put
into
the
case
demonstrates
we
are
not
as
favorably
situated
financially
as
any
of
the
applicants
as
reflected
in
that
income
working
capital
and
various
other
measures.
but
the
commission
has
not
said
we
are
not
a
good
competitor.
the
commission
in
its
first
report
which
the
department
of
justice
says
as
correctly
analyze
the
competitive
posture
of
this
case
points
out
that
we
compete
with
the
applicant
lines
in
the
11
states
that
we
provide
in
efficient
and
essential
service
in
the
areas
where
we
are
the
principle
competitors
of
the
applicants
that
the
shippers
look
to
the
milwaukee
for
active
and
vigorous
competition
both
in
rate
negotiations
and
in
quality
of
service.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
only
reference
in
this
whole
argument
to
any
improved
service
is
to
resolve
a
competition.
the
only
specific
example
has
been
that
a
faster
train
service
to
the
west
coast
which
was
a
result
of
the
milwaukee’s
competition.
for
the
department
of
justice
to
say
that
we
are
a
weak
competitor
represents
a
complete
turn
about
from
the
representations
made
by
the
department
to
the
commission.
in
its
brief
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
it
referred
to
the
acquisition
case
of
the
spokane
international
railroad
by
the
union
pacific
and
referred
to
the
court
decision
as
well
as
the
commission’s
decision
in
that
case
and
said,
this
recognition
by
the
commission
and
the
court
of
intense
competition
among
the
northern
lines
and
the
milwaukee
is
supported
by
ample
and
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
in
this
case.
meaning
the
case
before
us
today
and
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
to
support
a
contrary
finding.
the
department
went
on
and
pointed
out
that
the
milwaukee
generally
follows
the
route
of
the
northern
pacific.
it
is
a
10,596-mile
system.
milwaukee
is
in
competition
with
the
burlington
and
the
northern
lines
of
187
stations,
135
of
which
are
located
in
washington,
montana,
north
dakota
and
minnesota.
and
finally,
the
department
says,
applicants
admit
that
at
present
the
milwaukee
is
a
very
aggressive
and
effective
competitor
and
there
is
“intensive
competition”
between
them
for
the
traffic.
justice
department
went
further
and
in
their
brief
to
the
commission
pointed
out
nine
specific
representative
instances
of
how
the
milwaukee’s
active
and
vigorous
real
competition
and
independent
action
has
brought
great
advantages
to
the
public.
i
will
not
read
all
of
those
reasons,
they
appear
on
pages
140-142
of
justices’
brief
to
the
commission.
the
question
may
well
be
raised
that
we
are
such
a
good
competitor,
why
aren’t
we
rich?
or
perhaps
more
specifically,
why
is
our
share
of
the
traffic
so
small?
the
milwaukee-houston
find
to
the
area
which
in
serves
along
the
northern
interior
states
and
on
the
west
coast
principally
to
the
state
of
washington.
we
are
unable
to
serve
the
city
of
billings
which
is
the
principle
distribution
point
between
the
twin
cites
and
the
west
coast.
we
do
not
reach
portland
or
beaver
as
to
the
northern
lines
where
they
have
friendly
connections
to
work
with
for
traffic
moving
oregon
and
california.
we
do
not
have
a
fast
route
north
of
seattle
where
we
can
be
effectively
competitive
for
the
traffic
moving
to
in
and
from
canada.
and
finally,
with
the
western
injunctions,
west
to
the
twin
cites
is
closed
to
the
milwaukee
we
find
that
we
may
originate
traffic
in
the
mid-west
or
receive
traffic
from
our
connections
in
the
mid-west
and
when
we
get
as
far
as
the
twin
cities
we’re
compelled
to
turn
it
over
to
our
competitors
if
the
traffic
moves
to
a
station
local
to
our
competitors,
or
if
the
shipper
wants
our
competitors
to
have
a
line
haul.
notwithstanding
that
for
example,
a
car
going
to
vancouver-washington
could
physically
be
handled
by
the
milwaukee
all
the
way
to
tacoma,
and
then
turn
it
over
for
the
haul
beyond.
but
by
reason
of
the
rate
structure
and
the
right
which
the
northern
lines
held
under
the
law
to
protect
their
line
haul,
we
are
not
able
to
compete
for
that
traffic
for
the
long
haul.
now,
there
is
no
dissent
among
the
commissioners
in
their
first
report
that
the
milwaukee
should
have
adequate
protection.
this
was
one
thing
they
all
agreed
on,
the
six
majority
members
said
that
this
--
that
it
would
be
inconceivable
for
this
merger
to
be
approved
without
adequate
protection
for
the
milwaukee
and
five
dissenters
regretted
the
fact
that
the
commission
was
passing
up
an
opportunity
finally
to
make
the
milwaukee
complete
competitive
in
the
northern
jury
states
and
the
pacific
northwest.
with
these
conditions,
first
of
all
we’ll
be
able
to
handle
traffic
which
is
destined
to
or
from
billings,
or
which
is
to
be
stopped
off
at
billings
were
part
loading
or
part
unloading.
with
these
conditions,
we’ll
be
able
to
go
to
portland
where
the
southern
pacific
is
waiting
to
work
with
the
milwaukee
as
an
effective
route
for
traffic
to
in
and
from
the
california
and
oregon
on
the
one
hand
to
mid-west
and
the
rest
of
the
country
on
the
other
hand.
we’ll
be
able
to
participate
with
our
track
is
right
north
of
seattle
or
in
north
and
south
traffic
between
canada
and
california,
canada
and
oregon
on
an
equal
basis
with
the
northern
pacific
and
great
northern
after
they
emerged.
and
with
the
west
bound
traffic
that
we
now
handle
and
have
to
give
up
with
the
twin
cities
will
be
able
to
hold
that
traffic
and
take
it
to
our
part
of
this
junction.
our
solicitations
now
first
aren’t
all
that
important
if
a
shipper
first
is
dissatisfied
with
the
service
of
the
northern
lines
give,
or
secondly,
if
the
traffic
is
already
in
our
position
as
much
of
it
is
going
west
bound.
and
finally,
the
justice
department
again
has
conceded
that
the
milwaukee
will
be
strengthened
by
these
conditions.
the
effect
upon
the
shippers
is
been
discussed
here
by
mr.
tolan,
i
believe
that
the
purpose
of
the
antitrust
laws
is
not
so
much
to
start
out
competition
for
the
sake
of
competition
but
to
make
it
sure
that
there
will
be
a
free
flow
of
interstate
commerce
and
that
shippers
will
be
able
to
reach
their
markets
and
to
reach
their
source
of
supply
without
discrimination,
without
interference.
and
these
conditions
that
we
have
received
will
enable
milwaukee
shippers
to
do
exactly
that,
and
be
able
to
originate
a
car
on
our
railroad
and
stop
it
off
at
the
station
served
by
one
of
the
northern
lines
today
and
then
move
on
to
a
destination,
either
on
our
railroad
on
their
railroad.
these
benefits
are
important
where
the
free
flow
of
commerce
and
there
were
many,
many
shippers
of
great
size
and
importance
who
came
in
to
seek
this
opening
up
for
the
area
for
competition.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
will
open
up
competition
to
points
that
never
have
competition
before.
every
local
point
on
the
great
northern
where
the
northern
pacific
or
the
milwaukee
which
is
been
a
secret
domain
so
far
as
competition
is
concern
because
no
one
else
could
reach
it.
well,
now
we
open
for
competition
whereby
each
of
the
competing
railroads
may
so
visit
the
long
whole
of
the
traffic.
to
the
closest
junction
to
those
points
and
there
interchange
it
with
their
competitor
and
the
shipper
thereby
can
wheel
the
club
over
the
railroads
and
their
service
by
using
the
railroad
which
gives
them
the
best
service
for
the
long
haul
of
the
traffic.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
a
possibility
of
rate
competition,
yes
sir
there
is.
and
in
the
area
and
which
we
compete
we
have
given
them
quite
a
bit
of
rate
competition
and
we
find
that
in
many
instances
that
the
northern
lines
and
we
do
not
at
all
see
eye
to
eye
and
before
the
commission
and
before
the
courts
we
are
on
opposite
sides
as
we
try
to
adjust
our
rates
on
commodities
to
or
from
certain
territories.
and
the
northern
lines
have
appeared
to
protest
and
try
to
prevent
our
rate
changes
from
taking
effect.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
i
would
say
by
enlarge
that
rate
competition
is
the
more
troublesome
factor
and
the
more
likely
to
be
an
issue
between
the
railroads.
we
have
--
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
i
do
not
wish
to
indicate
that
service
is
not
important
i
believe
it
is
very
important
service.
but
i
think
that
we
find
our
disagreements
among
ourselves
and
our
attempts
to
better
our
position
manifest
itself
in
rate
adjustments
more
often
and
then
as
the
milwaukee
did
not
too
long
ago
improvement
of
a
service
in
a
very
drastic
or
substantial
manner.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
we
feel
that
it
will
tend
--
it
will
definitely
improve
our
competitive
position.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
yes
sir
and
their
merger.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
absence
of
the
conditions
of
milwaukee
took
a
very
strong
position
in
opposition
to
the
merger.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
because
the
merger
would
permit
the
improvement
of
service
by
the
northern
lines
permit
them
to
offer
their
shippers
more
than
they
can
offer
today,
permit
them
to
give
many
of
these
benefits
that
the
milwaukee’s
conditions
will
enable
the
milwaukee
to
give
it
shippers.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
if
they
were
able
to
lower
their
rates
and
justify
it
by
the
cost
of
their
handling
and
their
cost
were
lower
than
ours,
we
would
find
it
rather
difficult
to
match
their
rates.
the
suggestion
is
made
by
justice
department
that
this
relief
is
available
in
less
drastic
forms
and
a
merger
for
the
milwaukee
but
they
have
not
said
that
the
milwaukee
can
obtain
trackage
rights
to
portland,
obtain
trackage
rights
to
north
of
seattle,
and
be
kept
the
right
to
serve
billings
because
there
is
no
law
and
no
power
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
require
the
northern
lines
to
let
us
have
any
of
those
rights.
the
only
condition
that
is
possibly
obtainable
under
any
part
of
the
law
today
would
be
the
opening
of
the
western
injunctions
and
we
try
that
ones,
we
came
clear
up
to
the
supreme
court
and
although
the
justice
department
in
its
brief
to
this
court
points
its
finger
at
the
commission
and
says
they
have
done
nothing
to
help
the
milwaukee
break
the
stranglehold.
it
was
a
justice
department’s
standing
with
the
commission
who
opposed
us
all
the
way
in
the
lower
and
in
the
supreme
court
from
obtaining
that
relief.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
i
would
say
at
1955
or
1956
as
my
memory
stands
me.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
do
you
mean
sir
in
the
case
we
are
just
talking
about
where
we
attempted
to
open
the
gateway?
of
course,
at
that
time
there
was
no
proposal
to
merge
the
two
railroads
and
the
problem
in
the
law
as
it
exists
today
to
open
gateway
says,
it
must
be
shown
that
the
shipper
must
have
the
service.
and
the
law
prohibits
the
commission
from
opening
these
gateways
where
the
purpose
of
improving
the
financial
position
or
strength
of
the
carrier
who
seeks
these
gateways.
i
would
like
to
submit
to
the
court
in
the
few
minutes
remaining
that
this
is
a
situation
where
the
objectives
of
the
national
transportation
policy
and
of
antitrust
laws
in
both
be
carried
out.
there
is
no
conflict
here.
the
milwaukee
will
be
able
to
render
efficient
economic
transportation
for
its
shippers.
it
will
foster
sound
economic
conditions
for
the
milwaukee
and
it
will
be
able
to
provide
a
transportation
service
adequate
to
the
needs
of
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
postal
service
and
of
the
national
defense
in
accordance
with
the
national
transportation
policy.
at
the
same
time
the
purposes
of
the
antitrust
laws
are
frustrated
by
a
prevention
of
competition
as
much
as
by
anything
else.
and
when
a
competitor
such
as
the
milwaukee
road
is
prevented
from
competing
although
it
is
equipped
to
do
so,
the
antitrust
laws
objectives
are
especially
frustrated
and
here
with
the
conditions
to
the
milwaukee.
the
objectives
are
both
of
the
national
transportation
policy
and
the
antitrust
laws
can
be
carried
out.
and
i
would
like
in
closing
to
renew
a
promise
that
we
made
in
the
lower
court
and
that
is
that
if
this
merger
is
approved
subject
to
the
milwaukee’s
conditions.
we
promise
that
with
our
hands
is
finally
untied
so
that
we
can
physically
compete
for
traffic
over
our
line
to
and
from
washington
as
well
as
to
participate
in
traffic
to
and
from
canada,
oregon
and
california.
we
will
give
the
merge
company
and
other
competitors
such
as
the
union
pacific
and
the
canadian
pacific
who
have
profited
by
our
competitive
handcuffs
more
strong
vigorous
and
effective
competition
and
they
even
have
bargained
for?
