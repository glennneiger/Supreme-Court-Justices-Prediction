in

to
keep

of

in
perspective,
it
will
help
me
if
you
will
pinpoint
the
figure
if
you
have
it
in

of
the
competition
which
will
be

in

traffic
in

these

operate

it
--
chief

as
i
recall,
there
was
a
figure
somewhere
around
a
6%
of

in

aspect

another
figure,
could
you
pinpoint
those
for
me?

one
of

three
went

abstained,

that
what
you
told
us.
now,
if
you
don't
have
it,
those
figures.

so,
it
was
not
the
new
commissioner
who
altered
the
result?
basically,
it
was
the
change
in
the
position
of
some
of

chief

e.

mr.
mclaren,
as
i
read
this
record,
there
is
some
very,
very
substantial
reductions
in
the
time
runs.
now,
on
agricultural
products
which
was
one
of
the
figures
that
i
have
been
--
carried
in
my
mind
from
the
apple
growing
country
in
oregon
and
washington,
particularly
washington
i
guess,
that's
a
very
important
factor,
isn't
it
in
this
day
of
speed?
chief

warren
e.

you're
in
your
rebuttal
time
now,
if

(voice

some

mr.

chief

e.

well,
wasn't
that
a
beneficial
interest
of
any
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
wondering
how
much
you
would
weigh
this
great
northern
--
chief

warren
e.

we
will
take
that
up
after
lunch.

e.

mr.
kahn,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
mr.
mclaren
emphasized
also,
certainly
he
did
in
his
plea
that
the
condition
of
the
carrier,
one
or
both
of
the
merging
carriers
was
a
very
large
factor.
you
haven't
touched
on
that
at
all.

mr.

chief

warren
e.

mr.
cox
would
it
be
a
fair
or
a
safe
generalization
of
the
stock
in
this
problem
that
almost
all
mergers
have
an
anti-competitive
effect
in
some
degree
and
probably
in
some
degree
not
necessarily
the
same,
some
savings
and
benefits,
isn't
that
--
doesn't
that
underlie
the
whole
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
were
there
not
also
some
substantial
changes
in
that
interim
too?
chief

were
there
not
changes
made
to
accommodate
objectors

--
chief

warren
e.
burger
well,
on
a
6
to
5
split
in
the
first
go
around,
it
would
appear
to
be
a
case
in
which
it
would
take
very
slight
adding
to
one
