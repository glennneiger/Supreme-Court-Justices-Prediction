mr.
hugh
b.
cox
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
appear
in
this
case
for
the
applicant
railroads.
i
propose
to
discuss
in
the
first
instance
the
arguments
of
the
department
of
justice
and
reserve
i
hope
a
brief
period
of
time
in
my
argument
to
talk
about
the
arguments
of
the
stockholder's
committee
representing
stockholders
of
the
northern
pacific.
i
think
i
shall
unless
there
are
questions
from
the
court,
submit
the
appeal
of
the
livingston
anti-merger
committee
on
our
brief
where
it
is
discussed
in
considerable
detail.
turning
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that
underlies
the
problem
and
i
suppose
that
you
could
find
an
economist
who
would
say
the
more
competition
you
suppress,
the
more
savings
and
benefits
you
get.
but
it's
a
question
of
fact
in
each
case,
i
suppose
and
it
is
our
view
of
the
statute
that
what
congress
has
done
here
is
to
direct
and
authorize
the
committee
to
consider
the
elimination
of
competition
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
benefits
to
transportation
services
and
facilities
on
the
other.
and
having
made
that
consideration
to
decide
on
the
facts
of
a
particular
case,
and
not
by
the
application
of
some
rule
of
law,
general
application,
but
decide
on
the
facts
of
that
particular
case
whether
the
merger
or
preservation
of
the
competition
will
do
more
to
provide
--
improve
adequate
and
economical
transportation
service,
which
is
the
standard
that
we
find
in
the
statute.
now
that
as
we
see
it
was
the
issue
here.
it's
our
view
of
the
commission
in
the
second
report
did
exactly,
went
to
exactly
that
process
which
is
the
process
that
the
court
described
in
the
mclean
case
in
language
which
is
frequently
reiterated.
that
it
weighed
the
adverse
effects
on
competition
against
the
benefits,
improvements
in
transportation
services
and
facilities
on
the
other,
and
it
decided
on
balance
that
the
merger
would
do
more
to
provide
adequate,
economical
and
efficient
transportation
service
in
this
area
of
the
country
with
the
conditions
attached
than
would
preservation
of
the
competition
between
the
northern
lines.
they
made
findings
on
this
and
in
our
view
those
findings
are
supported
by
substantial
evidence
and
they
provide
a
reason,
a
basis
for
what
the
commission
did.
now
if
the
court
adheres,
i
submit
to
what
it
is
said
in
the
past,
that
should
be
the
end
of
this
case,
but
the
government's
argument
is
a
little
protean.
i
have
trouble
sometimes
getting
my
hands
on
it.
i'm
never
quite
sure
whether
the
department
of
justice
is
arguing
for
a
new
rule
of
law
which
in
effect
says
that
service
improvements
are
not
enough,
improvements
in
transportation
services
are
not
enough,
there
must
be
something
over
and
beyond
those
services
before
you
can
authorize
a
merger
that
suppresses
competition,
substantial
competition.
now
whether
that
is
really
their
argument
or
whether
they
are
in
effect
inviting
this
court
to
review
the
record
de
novo
and
make
an
independent
determination
on
whether
the
court
believes
this
merger
is
in
the
public
interest.
but
the
argument
seems
to
me
to
be
suspended
rather
uneasily
between
those
two
extremes.
now,
in
view
of
that
it
was
my
intention
this
afternoon
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
facts
because
i
think
any
way
you
look
at
this
case,
the
facts
deserve
some
consideration
and
perhaps
more
consideration
than
they
get
from
–
in
the
argument
of
the
department
of
justice.
while
it
is
quite
true
they
deal
with
these
facts
in
the
sense,
but
they
deal
with
them
in
a
rather
curious
technique
by
admitting
them
they
discount
them.
so
that
when
they
say,
"well,
of
course
we
admit
there'd
be
some
system,
service
improvements
here,"
i
don't
think
the
court
gets
from
that
the
full
force
and
flavor
of
what
this
record
shows
about
what
this
merger
means.
and
with
the
court's
permission
i
would
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
that,
even
though
i
suppose
some
sort
of
respects
the
assistant
attorney
general
will
not
dispute
these
facts.
now,
these
is
a
mass
of
evidence
in
this
record.
there
are
14,000
pages
of
transcript,
240
exhibits
on
examiner's
report,
it
takes
up
most
of
two
volumes
of
the
appendix
here.
and
a
great
deal
of
it
is
related
to
the
benefits
of
this
merger,
the
service
benefits,
the
improvement
in
the
service
and
facilities
and
it's
not
general
abstract
evidence.
it's
particularized
evidence
about
particular
commodities,
particular
markets,
particular
routes
and
particular
shipment.
and
i
can't
possibly
do
justice
to
it
but
there
are
three
sort
of
categories
to
this
evidence
i'd
like
to
say
something
about.
first,
evidence
that
has
to
do
with
the
faster
and
more
reliable
service,
now
that's
been
mentioned
here
this
morning,
the
expedited
schedules.
there
are
a
number
of
examples
of
those
i
could
give
to
the
court,
makes
a
difference
in
points
in
the
yakima
valley
of
12
hours
to
chicago
and
24
hours
to
kansas
city.
some
points
west
of
spokane,
it
means
24
hours
difference
to
chicago
in
immediate
point,
the
same
thing.
some
points
in
north
dakota
and
montana,
it
means
24
hours
to
--
faster
than
minneapolis.
now
the
real
point,
the
way
the
department
of
justice
apparently
tries
to
deal
with
that
is
to
say,
“well,
the
carriers
could
do
this
anyway
without
merger.”
this
anticipates
the
point
that
i
intended
to
deal
with
a
little
later,
but
i
will
say
this
about
that.
there
is
evidence
in
this
record,
not
in
the
record,
but
there's
evidence
which
everybody
has
taken
and
no
question
about
it
that
while
this
proceeding
was
pending
the
milwaukee
put
on
a
fast
train
between
chicago
and
seattle
and
i
might
pause
here
and
add
that
arguably
enough,
there
was
also
evidence
that
the
reason
they
did
that
was
because
of
fear
of
truck
competition.
the
northern
lines
responded
by
putting
on
fast
trains
and
the
--
we
are
told
that
that
shows
that
all
these
improved
schedules
could
be
achieved
without
merger.
well
now,
the
fact
is
and
the
commissions
referred
to
this
in
its
second
report,
not
the
--
it's
really
the
third
report,
it's
the
second
report
on
reconsideration.
these
trains
that
the
milwaukee
and
that
two
northern
lines
put
on
between
chicago
and
seattle
are
lightweight,
light
tonnage
trains
which
they
put
extra
power,
which
means
of
course
they're
carrying
--
they're
paying
more
for
every
ton
of
freight
they
carry
on
those
trains.
there's
one
of
those
trains
each
way,
each
day,
except
by
one
of
the
northern
lines
which
i
believe
skips
monday.
now,
in
contrast,
what
this
merger
will
do
will
be
is
provide
faster
schedules
for
the
fast
trains,
but
it's
going
to
provide
faster
schedules
for
all
the
trains,
the
regular
freight
trains
and
not
only
the
transcontinental
trains,
but
these
intermediate
trains.
so
that
the
suggestion
that
these
lightweight,
light
tonnage
trains
which
the
commission
took
into
account,
prove
that
the
carriers
can
do
these
improved
schedules
without
merger,
i
submit
is
not
really
supported
by
the
rational
consideration
of
the
evidence.
now,
the
other
kind
of
improvement,
the
two
other
things
i
should
like
to
mention,
one
is
the
improvement
in
car
supply,
which
this
merger
will
bring
which
is
a
very
serious
matter
in
this
part
of
the
country.
that
improvement
will
come
in
two
ways.
in
the
first
place,
the
improvement
in
schedules,
the
elimination
of
interchanges
and
the
elimination
of
switching
time,
turnaround
time
in
the
yards
is
going
to
make
more
cars
available
and
there's
a
reasoned
conservative
estimate
in
the
record
for
the
commission
that
this
will
mean
about
1700
additional
cars
daily,
which
will
be
available
for
loading.
now
that's
one
way
the
car
supply
will
be
improved.
another
way
it
will
be
improved
which
is
of
great
significance
is
that
under
--
when
the
lines
are
merged,
of
course
cars
will
be
centralized.
there'll
be
a
centralized
control
for
the
dispatch
and
distribution
of
the
cars.
today
there
is
evidence
to
this
kind
in
the
record.
those
lines
will
sometimes
stand
idle
on
one
of
the
lines,
while
the
point
not
too
far
away,
the
shipper
is
waiting
for
a
car.
well,
when
you
have
one
agency
distributing
those
cars
over
the
system
that
kind
of
things
certainly
be
reduced
and
maybe
eliminated.
now
the
third
thing
that
i
should
like
to
mention
about
these
service
benefits
because
--
so
that
the
court
will
get
some
sense
of
what's
in
this
record
is
a
mass
of
evidence
that
has
to
do
with
the
effect
of
improved
through
routes
and
single
line
service
which
is
often
in
many
cases,
some
commodities
are
cheaper
than
even
through
rates
by
two
railroad
and
the
transit
and
loading
and
unloading
privileges
which
this
merger
will
make
available
to
shippers.
now,
this
evidence
proves
and
it
rather
surprised
me
that
that
these
shippers
attached
great
importance
to
these
transit
and
loading
and
unloading
privileges.
what
they
mean
briefly
is
this.
that
if
a
shipper
ships
over
the
line
of
the
single
railroad
and
he
wants
to
stop
the
car
and
have
the
product
processed
in
some
way
and
then
move
on,
or
if
he
wants
to
send
--
start
out
a
car
half
loaded
and
then
load
it
completely,
or
if
he
wants
to
unload
it,
if
that
takes
place
on
the
line
of
a
single
railroad,
it
--
shipper
can
do
it
with
the
transfer
privilege
on
the
single
line
or
through
rate
which
is
an
advantageous
rate.
but
if,
when
he
stops
it
from
processing
or
loading
or
unloading,
he
wants
to
have
it
move
on
over
another
railroad,
he
pays
what
is
in
effect
a
higher
rate,
something
like
a
combination
rate.
now,
what
this
merger
does
is
to
make
those
privileges
available
to
system
wide.
they
are
not
now
because
the
northern
lines
don't
extend
this
kind
of
privilege
to
one
another,
but
available
over
the
entire
system
as
well
as
over
in
many
parts
of
the
milwaukee
as
a
result
of
the
conditions.
and
anyone
who
flavors
the
testimony,
even
in
the
examiner's
report
might
ask,
you
don't
have
to
go
on
the
record
to
see
what
importance
the
shippers
attached,
economic
importance,
to
these
particular
privileges.
they
open
up
markets
for
example.
they
will
enable
a
man
in
nebraska
who
hasn't
been
able
to
--
a
shipper,
a
lumber
shipper
in
the
first
instance
to
the
northwest
who
wants
to
have
lumber
processed
in
nebraska
and
sold
in
missouri
to
do
it
for
the
first
time
at
a
rate
which
will
enable
him
to
compete
with
lumber
moving
from
another
part
of
the
country.
now,
i
should
like
now
to
turn
although
i
have
to
some
extent
anticipated
myself
to
this
question
of
whether
these
things
can
be
done
without
merger.
i
have
talked
about
the
freight,
the
expedited
schedule.
i
think
mr.
kahn
has
made
the
point
which
was
not
i
think
left
entirely
clear
in
the
argument
this
morning
that
the
commission
did
make
some
findings
on
this.
the
--
they
made
the
findings
that
mr.
kahn
referred
to
and
the
examiner
made
a
finding
that
there
was
no
reasonable
expectation
that
these
railroads
could
achieve
these
improvements
in
service,
or
these
coordinations
if
they
remained
independent
competitors.
i
think
that
the
findings
that
the
commission
made
on
that
represent
one
area
of
agreement
between
the
first
and
the
second
reports,
because
in
the
first
report
the
majority
of
the
commission
there
said,
“we
agree
that
these
carriers
as
competitors
will
not
and
cannot
as
a
practical
matter
make
the
coordinations
from
which
they
derive
grossly
unequal
benefits.”
and
the
commission
in
the
second
report
found
that
most
of
these
instances,
these
coordinations
would
or
facilities
would
produce
grossly
unequal
benefits,
and
therefore
that
as
a
practical
matter,
it
was
not
reasonable
to
expect
the
railroads
to
make
them.
now
this
can
be
illustrated
and
again
to
give
you
some
flavor
of
the
record,
i
should
like
to
descend
into
details,
it
maybe
a
little
bit
variorum,
and
i
think
they
may
be
necessary.
one
of
the
things
that's
going
to
be
done
on
this
merger
is
to
coordinate
routes
so
that
the
trains
of
the
combined
system
move
over
the
best
and
most
expeditious
route.
for
example,
on
the
main
line
west,
the
main
route
will
be
composed
of
a
segment
of
the
line,
the
present
line
of
the
northern
pacific
from
the
twin
cities
to
a
point
in
north
dakota.
at
that
point,
the
traffic
will
move
on
to
what
is
now
the
main
line
of
the
great
northern,
which
is
a
much
better
line,
in
many
respects
and
will
move
on
the
line
of
the
great
northern
all
the
way
across
the
top
of
the
country
to
sandpoint
in
idaho.
at
that
point,
the
traffic
will
be
moved
over
to
a
line
of
the
northern
pacific
to
go
to
spokane,
and
then
from
spokane
it
will
move
on
to
the
coast
over
a
line
of
the
great
northern.
now,
if
you
stop
to
think
about
it
that
is
the
kind
of
thing,
they're
running,
they're
going
to
be
running
common
trains
that
cannot
be
done
by
two,
as
a
practical
matter,
by
two
independent
competing
companies.
despite
some
suggestions
this
morning
to
the
contrary,
the
commission
has
no
authority
to
compel
one
railroad
to
give
another
railroad
trackage
rights
over
its
line.
so
that
if
any
railroads
try
to
do
this,
there
would
have
to
be
arrangements
for
compensation
worked
out.
and
since
this
is
going
to
be
done
system
wide
on
all
the
routes,
what
you
would
have
to
think
about
would
be
the
two
railroads
sitting
down
to
decide.
they
were
going
to
run
trains
over
one
another's
routes,
perhaps
mixed
trains,
how
they
were
going
to
pay
one
another
for
the
--
on
a
fair
basis
for
the
advantages
that
each
got
out
of
it.
now,
i
submit
if
you
stop
to
think
about
that
quite
apart
from
the
practical
difficulties
which
would
i
think
would
make
the
exchange
ratio
look
easy,
apart
from
those,
you
couldn't
do
that
without
ending
what
would
practically
a
de
facto
pooling
of
revenues
and
sharing
of
profits.
and
that
relationship
could
hardly
be
consistent
with
really
effective
and
vigorous
competition
between
the
two
lines.
so
this
coordination
of
routes
--
as
a
commission
and
i
should
add
here
that
the
commission
in
the
first
report,
in
the
report
which
disapproved
the
merger,
the
commission
there
found
that
coordination
of
routes
between
competing
railroads
was
ordinarily
not
practical.
so
here
again,
there's
really
no
dispute
about
this.
now,
the
coordination
of
the
routes
is
an
essential
part
of
all
these
improvements
of
service.
it's
obvious
that
it
has
a
direct
relationship
with
the
schedules
of
the
car
supply,
but
it's
also
essential
to
the
coordination
of
these
terminal
facilities.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
in
order
to
construct
these
new
terminal
facilities,
you
have
to
rearrange
the
traffic.
you
have
difficulty
getting
ground
and
cities
usually
of
the
appropriate
kind
and
in
most
of
these
cities
the
two
railroads
come
into
the
city
from
different
directions
as
they
do
for
example
in
st.
paul.
so
that
what
as
an
essential
part
of
building
a
common
yard,
a
common
switching
and
assembly
yard,
the
trunk
line
traffic
has
to
be
moved.
as
i
explained
a
moment
ago,
all
of
that
trunk
line
traffic
in
st.
paul
is
going
to
come
in
to
st.
paul,
the
main
traffic,
east
and
west
over
a
line
of
the
northern
pacific.
now,
that
is
also
true
in
these
other
terminals
in
spokane
and
in
portland.
where
they
--
to
do
the
terminal
arrangements,
they
have
to
coordinate
the
routes,
really
they
have
to
run
mixed
trains.
now,
that
again
is
not
the
kind
of
saying
that
can
be
done,
these
yards
effectively
and
efficiently
between
two
competing
companies.
of
course
to
have
a
yard
in
which
there
are
two
companies
operating,
they're
both
--
each
other
is
going
to
be
want
to
be
sure
it
gets
its
trains
out
just
as
quick
as
the
other
fellow
does.
you'll
have
duplicate
yards,
duplicate
shipping
crews,
it's
a
switching
crews.
you
can't
do
these
things.
indeed,
there
is
here
i
think
a
strange
internal
inconsistency
in
the
argument
of
the
anti-trust
division
which
i
think
is
worse
comment.
if
you
did,
could
do
all
these
things,
these
by
voluntary
coordinations
between
the
carriers,
what
you
would
have
would
be
the
two
carriers
running
mixed
or
combined
trains
with
common
crews,
over
each
other's
routes
using
common
terminals
and
common
repair
facilities,
in
some
degree,
presumably
using
a
managerial
staff
in
common.
they'd
still
have
to
have
a
common
agency
distributing
the
freight
cars.
you
would
have
a
relationship,
a
cooperative
relationship
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
existence
of
the
kind
of
competition
that
the
anti-trust
division
says
it
should
be
preserved.
and
indeed,
it
somewhat
surprises
me
to
hear
them
taking
this
line
in
this
case
because
in
other
context,
they
have
frequently
pointed
out
the
dangers
and
indeed
the
illegality
that
will
arise
from
these
cooperative
and
joint
undertakings,
which
is
exactly
what
they
seem
to
be
arguing
for
here.
i
think
that
i
should
now
like
to
speak
briefly
to
the
--
to
one
matter
and
leave
it
without
much
comment
and
that's
the
matter
of
the
savings
to
the
railroad.
i
should
merely
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
direct
relationship
between
the
improvements
in
service
and
of
the
savings
because
the
savings
come
in
large
part,
not
entirely,
but
in
large
part
from
the
coordination
of
facilities
and
from
the
quicker
routes
and
the
other
steps
that
will
produce
the
better
service
to
the
shippers.
so
that
it
is
a
mistake
to
think
of
these
savings
as
being
of
only
in
direct
benefit
to
the
shippers,
because
they
do
have
a
direct
relationship
to
the
service
improvements.
but
apart
from
that
the
commission
made
findings
which
all
relate
to
matters
that's
entitled
to
give
weight
to
under
section
5
(2),
which
pointed
out
that
the
savings
would
increase
the
pressure
--
decrease
the
pressure
for
rate
increases
which
comes
from
increasing
costs
that
they
would
--
by
improving
the
rate
of
return
of
the
carriers
put
them
in
a
better
position
to
buy
a
modern
and
improved
equipment,
and
that
they
would
increase
their
capacity
and
power
to
compete
with
the
trucks,
which
is
--
and
other
modes
of
transportation.
now
the
department
of
justice
as
i
said
in
the
beginning
seems
to
admit
these
are
---
these
benefits
exist
in
a
way,
but
it
says
that
they
really
are
not
important
as
against
the
loss
of
competition
will
be
caused
by
the
merger
of
the
two
northern
lines.
and
as
i
said
earlier,
their
view
seems
to
be
that
almost
as
a
matter
of
law
you
need
something
beside
improvements
in
transportation
services
and
facilities,
you
need
something
over
and
above
and
beyond
that
of
a
more
extraordinary
character.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
am
not
exactly
the
man
to
develop
that.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
they
give
two
examples
although
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
a
failing
carrier,
the
other
one
is
where
you
have
two
prosperous
carriers,
but
there
you
need
to
put
them
together
so
they
can
service
--
save
a
third
failing
carrier
like
the
new
haven
now
in
the
penn-central
case.
do
you
follow
me
on
that?
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
those
are
the
only
two
examples
that
they
have
given
us
and
there's
a
footnote
in
their
reply
brief
which
to
some
degree
casts
doubt
on
what
--
whether
they
--
what
they
really
mean
about
the
failing
carrier,
but
that's
as
far
as
i
can
go,
i
regret
to
say
it
in.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that
is
their
position.
now
we've
developed
this
legal
argument
in
our
brief
and
i
don't
want
to
retread
what
mr.
kahn
has
said,
but
we
point
out
in
our
brief
a
number
of
things
about
that
argument.
one
is
that
the
act
itself
almost
by
term
shows
that
congress
was
not
prepared
to
rely
upon
competition
producing
its
benefits.
and
we
all
--
we
point
out
specifically
that
in
the
adequacy
of
transportation
service
is
one
of
the
four
things
in
section
5
(2)
(c)
that
the
commission
is
required
to
give
weight
to
when
it
is
asked
to
consider
a
merger,
and
we
also
point
out
that
the
national
transportation
policy,
which
of
course
pervades
in
the
degree
the
interpretation
of
the
provisions
of
the
acts,
speaks
in
terms
of
efficient,
economical,
adequate
and
safe
transportation
service.
now,
it
is
our
view
that
you
look
at
the
statute
and
you
look
at
the
provisions
of
the
statute,
the
very
kinds
of
benefits
that
this
case
produces
to
shippers
are
the
kinds
of
benefits
that
the
congress
authorized
the
commission
to
consider,
and
if
it
had
a
reasoned
judgment
on
the
matter
and
evidence
to
support
it,
could
decide,
justify
the
merger
that
suppressed
substantial
competition.
and
of
course
we
argue
too
from
the
mclean
case
and
the
sea
board
case
particularly
that
they
were
precisely
cases
of
that
kind.
that's
what
the
commission
did
and
this
court
sustained
it.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
don't
think
they
would
go
that
far,
but
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
when
they're
--
well,
i
couldn't
honestly
say
that
i
could
read
their
briefs
that
way.
i
--
as
i
have
said
before,
i
have
some
difficulty
in
getting
it
and
analyzing
it
precisely,
but
i
would
say
they
do
say
that
you
can't
ever
have
a
merger
in
that
situation
unless
you
have
some
very
extraordinary
and
special
benefit
that
goes
far
beyond
improvements
of
service.
and
the
only
two
i
know
anything
about
are
the
new
haven
situation
or
the
bankrupt
carrier
that's
a
--
now,
mr.
kahn
has
discussed
the
competitive
effect
of
this
merger
was
particularly
with
the
view
to
suggesting
that
the
department
has
exaggerated
the
quantitative
extent
to
which
competition
is
affected,
and
i
don't
want
to
cover
any
of
that
ground
again.
there
are
some
things
about
the
competitive
situation
that
i
think
it
might
be
useful
for
me
to
speak
very
briefly.
one
of
them
asked
the
--
they
really
relate
not
so
much
to
the
quantity
of
competition
that
is
eliminated,
but
to
the
economic
significance
of
that
elimination
and
particularly
economic
significance
in
relation
to
the
adequacy,
efficiency
and
economy
of
transportation
services
because
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
here
that
we,
at
least
in
our
view,
are
not
operating
under
a
statute
which
gives
the
competition
as
such
or
in
the
abstract
some
overriding
and
controlling
importance.
it
is
an
important
consideration
and
the
commission
treated
it
as
being
important,
but
it's
important
as
it
relates
to
the
contribution
it
makes
to
good
and
improved
transportation
services.
now,
so
that
economic
consequences
in
that
sense
to
which
i
wish
to
speak
very
briefly,
the
committee
--
the
argument
for
the
department
of
justice
i
think
rolls
together
a
number
of
things,
specifically
two
of
them
particularly
which
are
quite
different.
i
think
this
has
been
clear,
but
i
should
like
to
be
sure
it's
clear.
they
take
the
traffic
at
points
where
there
are
only
the
two
northern
lines
and
they
combine
that
with
the
points
at
which
there
are
the
two
northern
lines
and
one
or
more,
sometimes
three
or
four
other
railroads.
now
of
course
the
effect
of
this
merger
at
those
points
is
quite
different,
there's
a
significant
difference.
at
the
points
where
you
have
only
the
northern
lines,
the
two
northern
lines,
you
remove
all
way
of
competition
by
this
merger,
but
those
points
are
not
significant
enough,
either
in
terms
of
value
of
--
on
the
volume
of
traffic
produced,
or
in
the
markets
they
serve
to
support
the
argument
on
the
other
side,
so
they
have
to
combine
the
6%
of
the
revenues
that
come
from
points
of
that
kind,
that
is
where
there
are
only
the
two
northern
lines,
with
the
revenues
from
the
points
where
there
are
other
railroads
in
addition
to
the
northern
lines.
and
it's
that
way
they
derive
their
percentage
of
43
or
44%
which
is
said
to
be
the
effect
of
the
extent
to
which
it
eliminates
competition
at
least
on
a
station
basis.
now,
i
have
said
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two
situations
and
it's
obvious,
it
is
the
question
i
suppose
really
is,
if
you
eliminate
one
of
three
or
four
railroads,
how
economically
significant
is
that
in
this
industry
in
relation
to
the
service
and
the
rate
the
shipper
will
get?
it
--
true,
it
is
an
elimination
or
a
reduction
of
competition,
but
there's
nothing
in
this
record
that
suggests
in
any
way
that
the
elimination
of
one
of
several
competing
railroads
in
this
industry
has
effects
that
are
quite
as
devastating
on
railroad
service
and
railroad
rates,
as
the
argument
on
the
other
side
suggests.
and
there's
some
pretty
hard
empirical
evidence
that
points
in
the
contrary
direction,
that
is
the
evidence
of
the
shippers.
now,
there
are
large
number
of
shippers
who
testified
here,
and
a
great
many
of
these
shippers
came
from
these
points
where
there
will
be
a
reduction
by
one
in
a
number
of
railroads
serving
the
points.
yet
all
of
these
shippers,
practically
unanimous,
all
of
these
shippers
while
saying,
“competition
is
a
good
thing,
and
we
like
competition,”
all
of
them
supported
this
merger
particularly
as
it
was
conditioned
to
protect
the
milwaukee
and
the
northwestern.
now
that
evidence
seems
to
me
to
indicate
pretty
clearly
that
the
shippers
at
least,
so
long
as
they
have
two
or
more
railroads,
believe
that
the
benefits
of
this
merger
to
them
in
their
pragmatic
judgment,
the
benefits
of
this
merger
to
them
are
economically
more
consequence
than
the
elimination
of
one
railroad
out
of
several
at
these
points.
now
i
--
that
is
not
of
course
is
not
a
question
to
be
decided
essentially
by
a
pool
of
shippers,
but
certainly
the
unanimity
of
the
support
from
the
shippers
is
pretty
persuasive
evidence
that
looking
at
economic
consequences,
there
was
nothing
unreasonable
in
the
judgment
that
the
commission
made
here.
i
think,
since
i
have
mentioned
the
shipper
testimony,
i
should
say
one
thing
more
about
it
because
it
--
this
shipper
testimony
on
several
aspects
of
the
case
is
rather
embarrassing
to
the
anti-trust
division
and
in
their
reply
brief
they
suggest
that
the
court
really
shouldn't
pay
any
attention
to
it
because
--
well
they
say
that
perhaps
the
shippers
were
brainwashed
by
the
railroads
and
they
also
suggest
that
they
are
frightened
of
the
railroad.
well,
as
to
the
first
question,
the
first
suggestion,
i
merely
observe
that
there
were
200
and
--
more
than
200
of
these
shippers
and
about
39
associations
representing
shippers
who
testified,
they
were
cross-examined.
the
examiner
accepted
their
evidence
as
credible
and
persuasive
and
there's
plenty
of
evidence
in
this
record
that
they
don't
hesitate
to
litigate
and
to
oppose
the
railroads
when
they
want
to.
in
fact
they
bitterly
opposed
the
railroads
in
the
first
hearing
in
this
case
on
the
question
of
milwaukee
conditions.
but
there
really
isn't
any
basis
for
the
suggestion
that
the
railroads
brainwashed
them.
the
suggestion
we
frightened
them
rests
on,
apparently
on
a
footnote
citation
of
an
article
by
a
professor
in
the
trade
journal.
rather
a
remarkable
attempt
to
discredit
at
a
large
number
of
witnesses
by
a
rather
feeble
weapon,
i
think,
but
i
suggest
that
the
--
that
these
witnesses
deserve
consideration
and
weight
as
was
given
to
them
both
by
the
examiner
and
by
the
commission.
now
there
are
two
other
things
about
the
economic
consequences
of
the
elimination
of
competition
that
will
be
eliminated
here
that
i
think
are
significant.
one
has
been
referred
to
which
is
the
conditions
for
the
milwaukee.
and
i
merely
say
about
that,
that
while
the
department
attempts
to
dismiss
the
milwaukee
as
a
weak
and
ineffective
competitor,
again
there
is
ample
testimony
in
this
record
from
the
shippers
that
the
milwaukee
has
been,
even
without
the
conditions,
an
effective
competitor.
and
there's
also
evidence
that
they
expect
with
the
conditions
as
--
that
it
will
be
an
even
more
effective
competitor,
and
there's
no
doubt
about
the
effective
--
what
those
conditions
will
do
to
its
competitive
power.
it's
true
it
doesn't
have
as
much
money
as
the
northern
lines.
it
doesn't
have
as
big
a
volume
of
traffic,
isn't
as
large,
but
those
facts
do
not
mean
that
the
company
is
an
ineffective
competitor.
indeed
if
i
may
take
somewhat
the
same
line
i
took
a
moment
ago,
i
have
often
heard
the
anti-trust
division
attached
great
importance
to
the
activities
of
small
competitors
on
the
ground
that
they
make
up
in
hunger,
ambition
and
enterprise
for
their
lack
of
resources.
well,
the
milwaukee
here
is
certainly
has
been
and
will
be,
i
think
on
the
basis
of
the
facts,
an
effective
competitor.
the
other
thing
that
i
should
like
to
mention
before
the
court
rises
is
the
question
of
intermodal
competition
which
again
as
i
think
has
been
dismissed
by
the
department
of
justice
without
a
recognition
of
what
the
record
shows.
here
again,
the
evidence
is
there's
a
great
deal
of
particularized
evidence
on
what
trucks
are
dong
in
this
part
of
the
united
states.
there
may
not
be
as
much
truck
competition
in
the
northwest
as
there
is
in
the
northern
tier
as
there
is
elsewhere,
but
there's
enough
of
it
to
exert
a
very
direct
and
heavy
pressure
on
these
railroads
competitively.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
testimony
from
some
of
these
shippers,
and
along
this
the
citations
in
one
place
of
shippers
who
said,
“the
real
competition
today
is
not
the
rate
competition
is
not
between
the
railroads
and
the
other
railroads,
it's
between
the
trucks
and
the
railroads.”
and
as
far
as
these
agricultural
commodities
are
concerned,
the
bulk
commodities,
there's
particularized
evidence
that
trucks
are
moving
in
increasing
quantities
grain,
agricultural
commodities,
lumber,
paper
products,
lime,
salt,
a
whole
range
of
bulk
products
which
one
time
were
thought
to
be
immune
to
truck
competition,
and
of
course
no
one
disputes
that
they
are
moving
--
have
been
moving
large
quantities
of
the
merchandise
traffic,
which
is
the
traffic
that
the
move
to
the
large
part
into
this
territory
instead
of
out
of
it.
the
trucks
have
improved
their
time
schedules
as
i
made
the
reference
to
the
milwaukee
situation
a
moment
ago,
and
they're
building
highways
so
that
their
time
between
the
twin
cities
and
the
west
coast
in
some
instances
will
be
less
than
that
of
the
railroads
today.
so
that
this
--
the
trucks
which
also
serve
these
points,
not
only
they
serve
the
points,
not
only
where
there
are
railroads
left,
but
they
serve
the
points
where
there
will
be
one
railroad
left
and
they
provide
effective
and
direct
competition
today
which
in
its
strength
and
vigor
is
sufficiently
compensates
for
the
loss
of
one
railroad
at
the
points
where
there
are
several
railroads.
now,
i've
taken
these
things
together.
i
should
like
to
suggest
to
this
point
in
the
argument,
i
believe
it
was
that,
that
the
--
when
the
commission
made
this
balancing
--
went
through
the
balancing
process
in
its
second
report,
which
is
what
it
did.
it
did
not
depreciate
the
value
of
competition,
but
as
compared
with
what
it
did
in
the
first
report
it
engaged
in
a
more
thoughtful
and
detailed
analysis
of
what
kind
of
competition
would
be
left,
very
important,
and
what
the
economic
significance
to
the
competition
that
was
eliminated
really
was.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
oh,
certainly,
the
milwaukee
conditions
of
course
were
in
a
direct
bearing
on
the
competitive
situation
as
did
the
northwestern
conditions,
and
those
were
--
that
was
an
important
factor
as
was
the
labor
conditions
were
also
important,
but
i
was
speaking
largely
of
the
consideration
of
the
competitive
balance
between
competition
and
the
loss
of
competition
and
the
benefits,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that
is
quite
so,
and
of
course
there
were
three
members
of
the
commission
who
did
change
their
minds,
three
who
didn't,
who
had
voted
for
the
merger
in
the
first
case
and
two
new
appointees
who
came
to
it
fresh
and
voted
for
the
merger
and
that
was
how
the
majority
of
eight
was
composed
on
the
second
court.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
morning
i
shall
discuss
the
exchange
ratio.
the
negotiations
over
that
ratio
extended
for
more
than
three-and-a-half
years
and
as
it
was
observed
yesterday,
each
of
the
two
companies
here
was
advised
by
an
independent
firm
of
investment
bankers:
northern
pacific
by
morgan
stanley
and
the
great
northern
by
first
boston.
now,
as
mr.
dailey
indicated,
one
of
the
perhaps
the
greatest
problem
in
these
negotiations
was
the
natural
resource
properties
in
northern
pacific.
it
was
agreed
by
everyone
on
both
sides
of
the
bargaining
table
that
if
you
looked
at
merely
railroad
properties
and
railroad
earnings,
the
great
northern
was
entitled
to
a
very
substantial
premium
in
this
change
ratio.
but
the
northern
pacific’s
decision
was
that
its
natural
resource
properties
entitled
it
to
apparent
share-for-share.
the
great
northern
took
the
position
that
that
was
not
the
case.
it
said,
even
with
the
natural
resource
earnings
based
on
historical
record
of
earnings,
it
was
entitled
to
a
substantial
preference
in
this
exchange
ratio
and
it
took
different
positions
about
the
amount
of
that
preference,
but
toward
the
end
of
the
negotiations
it
said
that
it
thought
that
giving
due
allowance
to
the
natural
resources,
it
was
entitled
to
about
a
20%
premium.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no,
it
is
from
industrial
properties,
but
i
think
that
you
can
fairly
say
as
a
general
matter
that
its
earnings
represent
earnings
from
railroad
activities.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
it
has
some
industrial
real
estate
and
some
properties
of
that
kind
but
nothing
like
to
properties
of
the
northern
pacific.
i
think
that
has
to
be
said.
this
went
on
until
1960,
that
kind
and
i
think
this
is
rather
significant,
the
banking
advisers
of
northern
pacific,
morgan
stanley
suggested
the
compromise
was
finally
adopted
which
the
exchange
ratio
that
the
parties
agreed
to.
now,
that
was
described
yesterday.
i
merely
would
like
to
say
this
about
the
ratio.
the
reasoning
that
underlies
it
is
that
it
gives
the
shareholders
of
northern
pacific
in
the
long
term
and
equal
share
in
the
equity
of
this
new
company.
but
at
the
same
time
it
gives
an
immediate
but
not
a
lasting
recognition
through
this
preferred
stock
to
the
historical
fact
that
the
earnings
and
dividends
of
the
great
northern
had
been
greater
than
the
exchange
ratio
was
established.
now
this
compromise
proposed
by
morgan
stanley
was
approved
by
both
investment
banking
houses
by
the
board
of
directors
of
each
company
and
it
was
twice
approved
by
the
stockholders
of
northern
pacific.
once
in
1961
and
once
last
year
in
1968,
and
each
occasion
it
was
approved
by
73%
of
stockholders,
the
first
time
are
about
6%
of
the
stockholders
who
voted
against
it,
the
second
time
about
2%
of
the
stockholders
who
voted
against
it.
i
think
it
must
be
said
about
the
2%
to
decline
in
that
vote.
but
the
committee
conducted
a
proxy
fight
and
that
they
did
ask
that
those
who
favored
their
point
of
view
not
vote
as
well
as
vote
against.
so
that
no
doubt
that
the
part
accounted
for
they
declined
in
the
vote.
but
the
committee
in
the
proxy
fight
presented
all
the
arguments
that
they
have
presented
here.
now
the
commission
and
the
trial
examiner
both
bound
that
this
ratio
was
just
and
reasonable.
the
commission
found
that
it
fairly
represented
the
contribution
that
each
group
or
shareholders
has
made
to
the
new
enterprise.
i
emphasize
that
fact
because
i
think
the
impression
might
have
been
left
for
the
court
yesterday
that
commission
based
its
approval
of
the
ratio
solely
on
the
finding
that
there
was
arm’s
length
bargaining.
well,
it
did
find
that
there
have
been
arm’s
length
bargaining
but
it
also
made
this
finding
on
the
fair
contribution
to
the
--
to
the
new
company
by
each
group
of
shareholders.
the
findings
that
were
made
by
the
commission
on
fairness
to
ratio,
we
submit
are
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
evidence
to
the
--
that
supported
the
commission’s
finding
that
this
ratio
fairly
represented
the
contribution
made
by
each
group
of
shareholders.
the
ratio
was
based
by
--
and
it
got
finally
on
an
appraisal
of
earnings
both
on
appraisal
of
the
past
earnings
to
which
there
was
evidence
before
the
parties
and
which
was
before
the
commission,
and
a
judgment
about
the
earnings
in
the
future
including
the
earnings
of
the
natural
resources
properties.
the
parties
didn’t
use
any
arithmetical
formula
but
they
reached
a
judgment
about
that
and
established
the
exchange
ratio
accordingly.
now,
the
committee
seems
to
make
really
two
points
about
the
evidences
complaining
the
fact
that
the
ratio
wasn’t
based
on
asset
appraisal
of
the
market
value
of
these
properties.
they
suggested
there
was
really
no
evidence
about
that
before
the
commission,
but
i
think
that
is
not
quite
a
complete
count
of
what
did
happen.
there
was
each
of
the
railroads
here
got
independent
as
said
appraisals
from
independent
firms
are
the
more
important
to
these
properties.
and
then
their
direct
testimony
before
the
commission,
the
executive
of
the
railroad
applicants
testified
about
these
appraisals
and
explained
why
they
didn’t
use
them
in
establishing
the
exchange
ratio.
the
committee
asked
the
appraisals
and
they
were
produced
and
the
committee
put
them
an
evidence
before
the
commission.
so
the
commission
had
some
evidence,
had
the
evidence
about
the
asset
appraisals
and
also
testimony
about
why
they
weren’t
used.
they
weren’t
used
because
they
were
in
parties’
judgment
they
were
not
as
reliable
earnings,
there
were
enormous
differences
between
them,
and
even
the
independent
firms
who
made
them
in
some
instances
said
they
weren’t
sure
that
they
reflected
market
value.
the
committee
also
complains
that
not
enough
weight
was
given
to
the
earnings
of
the
natural
resource
properties
of
the
northern
pacific.
it
says
they
should’ve
been
valued
at
50
times
earnings
or
perhaps
to
22-1/2
times
earnings.
but
i
submit
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
required
the
commission
to
accept
those
particular
arithmetical
formulas
as
a
standard
for
judging
the
legality
of
this
exchange
ratio.
the
50
times
earnings
at
the
time
is
testified
to
would
have
produced
a
value
for
the
natural
resources
property
of
the
northern
pacific
alone,
which
was
$90
million
than
the
--
higher
than
the
total
stock
market
value
of
the
entire
enterprise
including
the
railroad
properties.
it
would
have
produced
evaluation
that
was
$280
million
more
than
the
amount
to
the
committee
proposed
that
these
properties
be
sold
for
in
connection
with
the
divestiture
proposal
of
the
committee
put
before
the
commission,
so
that
the
formula
really
didn’t
come
within
any
measurable
distance
of
reality.
the
22-1/2
times
formula
if
it
applied
to
the
five
years
before
1960
when
the
exchange
ratio
was
determined
produces
an
exchange
ratio
that
a
little
less
favorable
to
the
northern
pacific
stockholders
than
they
want
--
than
the
ratio
they
actually
received.
that’s
true
if
you
applied
in
some
more
recent
years.
now,
the
committee
can
apply
up
to
certain
years
and
get
the
results
that
they
say
show
that
the
ratio
was
unfair
and
these
computations
are
in
our
brief
--
in
their
brief.
i'm
inclined
to
think
that
what
they
show
is
that
with
one
of
these
arithmetical
formulas,
you
can
get
different
results
to
apply
them
to
different
years.
but
the
fact
is
that
there
was
substantial
evidence
before
the
commission
about
all
the
matters,
to
parties
considered
in
relation
to
earnings,
the
various
things
that
affected
earnings
past
and
what
would
might
affect
them
in
the
future
to
indicate
that
this
exchange
ratio
had
a
substantial
basis
and
that
evidence
was
all
before
the
commission
and
they
discussed
in
detail
were
about
28
pages
and
examiner’s
report
about
11
pages
and
the
commission’s
report
that
sets
out
this
evidence.
now,
what
i
have
said
about
the
finding
as
to
the
fairness,
the
contribution
that
each
group
of
shareholders
made
to
the
company.
i
think
could
also
be
said
about
the
finding
that
there
was
arm’s
length
bargaining.
both
the
examiner
and
the
commission
made
that
finding
and
the
examiner
made
it
after
hearing
testimony
from
the
executives
who
participated
in
these
negotiations
and
from
the
representatives
of
the
banking
house
which
participated
and
advised
the
two
companies.
i
think
that
i
understand
what
the
--
that
is
the
point
of
view
is,
i
think
they
believe,
no
doubt
sincerely
that
the
commission
they
have
given
too
much
weight
to
some
evidence
and
not
enough
weight
to
another
--
other
or
that
perhaps
for
variant
inferences
to
the
inferences
that
the
examiner
and
the
commission
drew
from
the
evidence.
but,
i
think
it
cannot
be
said
really
that
these
findings
lack
support
and
substantial
evidence
in
the
record.
now,
the
committee
makes
another
contention
which
was
referred
to
briefly
yesterday
and
that
is
that
the
commission
abused
its
discretion
in
1968
when
it
didn’t
reopen
this
record
and
that
retry
the
issue
of
the
fairness
to
the
exchange
ratio.
we
have
discussed
that
point
in
our
brief
and
replied
to
the
showings
that
they
have
made
was
to
change
conditions
with
the
analysis
to
those
conditions
which
we
submit
that
shows
that
the
matters
on
which
they
rely
do
not
really
support
the
argument
that
the
commission
abused
its
discretion.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
appear
in
this
case
for
the
applicant
railroads.
i
propose
to
discuss
in
the
first
instance
the
arguments
of
the
department
of
justice
and
reserve
i
hope
a
brief
period
of
time
in
my
argument
to
talk
about
the
arguments
of
the
stockholder's
committee
representing
stockholders
of
the
northern
pacific.
i
think
i
shall
unless
there
are
questions
from
the
court,
submit
the
appeal
of
the
livingston
anti-merger
committee
on
our
brief
where
it
is
discussed
in
considerable
detail.
turning
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that
underlies
the
problem
and
i
suppose
that
you
could
find
an
economist
who
would
say
the
more
competition
you
suppress,
the
more
savings
and
benefits
you
get.
but
it's
a
question
of
fact
in
each
case,
i
suppose
and
it
is
our
view
of
the
statute
that
what
congress
has
done
here
is
to
direct
and
authorize
the
committee
to
consider
the
elimination
of
competition
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
benefits
to
transportation
services
and
facilities
on
the
other.
and
having
made
that
consideration
to
decide
on
the
facts
of
a
particular
case,
and
not
by
the
application
of
some
rule
of
law,
general
application,
but
decide
on
the
facts
of
that
particular
case
whether
the
merger
or
preservation
of
the
competition
will
do
more
to
provide
--
improve
adequate
and
economical
transportation
service,
which
is
the
standard
that
we
find
in
the
statute.
now
that
as
we
see
it
was
the
issue
here.
it's
our
view
of
the
commission
in
the
second
report
did
exactly,
went
to
exactly
that
process
which
is
the
process
that
the
court
described
in
the
mclean
case
in
language
which
is
frequently
reiterated.
that
it
weighed
the
adverse
effects
on
competition
against
the
benefits,
improvements
in
transportation
services
and
facilities
on
the
other,
and
it
decided
on
balance
that
the
merger
would
do
more
to
provide
adequate,
economical
and
efficient
transportation
service
in
this
area
of
the
country
with
the
conditions
attached
than
would
preservation
of
the
competition
between
the
northern
lines.
they
made
findings
on
this
and
in
our
view
those
findings
are
supported
by
substantial
evidence
and
they
provide
a
reason,
a
basis
for
what
the
commission
did.
now
if
the
court
adheres,
i
submit
to
what
it
is
said
in
the
past,
that
should
be
the
end
of
this
case,
but
the
government's
argument
is
a
little
protean.
i
have
trouble
sometimes
getting
my
hands
on
it.
i'm
never
quite
sure
whether
the
department
of
justice
is
arguing
for
a
new
rule
of
law
which
in
effect
says
that
service
improvements
are
not
enough,
improvements
in
transportation
services
are
not
enough,
there
must
be
something
over
and
beyond
those
services
before
you
can
authorize
a
merger
that
suppresses
competition,
substantial
competition.
now
whether
that
is
really
their
argument
or
whether
they
are
in
effect
inviting
this
court
to
review
the
record
de
novo
and
make
an
independent
determination
on
whether
the
court
believes
this
merger
is
in
the
public
interest.
but
the
argument
seems
to
me
to
be
suspended
rather
uneasily
between
those
two
extremes.
now,
in
view
of
that
it
was
my
intention
this
afternoon
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
facts
because
i
think
any
way
you
look
at
this
case,
the
facts
deserve
some
consideration
and
perhaps
more
consideration
than
they
get
from
–
in
the
argument
of
the
department
of
justice.
while
it
is
quite
true
they
deal
with
these
facts
in
the
sense,
but
they
deal
with
them
in
a
rather
curious
technique
by
admitting
them
they
discount
them.
so
that
when
they
say,
"well,
of
course
we
admit
there'd
be
some
system,
service
improvements
here,"
i
don't
think
the
court
gets
from
that
the
full
force
and
flavor
of
what
this
record
shows
about
what
this
merger
means.
and
with
the
court's
permission
i
would
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
that,
even
though
i
suppose
some
sort
of
respects
the
assistant
attorney
general
will
not
dispute
these
facts.
now,
these
is
a
mass
of
evidence
in
this
record.
there
are
14,000
pages
of
transcript,
240
exhibits
on
examiner's
report,
it
takes
up
most
of
two
volumes
of
the
appendix
here.
and
a
great
deal
of
it
is
related
to
the
benefits
of
this
merger,
the
service
benefits,
the
improvement
in
the
service
and
facilities
and
it's
not
general
abstract
evidence.
it's
particularized
evidence
about
particular
commodities,
particular
markets,
particular
routes
and
particular
shipment.
and
i
can't
possibly
do
justice
to
it
but
there
are
three
sort
of
categories
to
this
evidence
i'd
like
to
say
something
about.
first,
evidence
that
has
to
do
with
the
faster
and
more
reliable
service,
now
that's
been
mentioned
here
this
morning,
the
expedited
schedules.
there
are
a
number
of
examples
of
those
i
could
give
to
the
court,
makes
a
difference
in
points
in
the
yakima
valley
of
12
hours
to
chicago
and
24
hours
to
kansas
city.
some
points
west
of
spokane,
it
means
24
hours
difference
to
chicago
in
immediate
point,
the
same
thing.
some
points
in
north
dakota
and
montana,
it
means
24
hours
to
--
faster
than
minneapolis.
now
the
real
point,
the
way
the
department
of
justice
apparently
tries
to
deal
with
that
is
to
say,
“well,
the
carriers
could
do
this
anyway
without
merger.”
this
anticipates
the
point
that
i
intended
to
deal
with
a
little
later,
but
i
will
say
this
about
that.
there
is
evidence
in
this
record,
not
in
the
record,
but
there's
evidence
which
everybody
has
taken
and
no
question
about
it
that
while
this
proceeding
was
pending
the
milwaukee
put
on
a
fast
train
between
chicago
and
seattle
and
i
might
pause
here
and
add
that
arguably
enough,
there
was
also
evidence
that
the
reason
they
did
that
was
because
of
fear
of
truck
competition.
the
northern
lines
responded
by
putting
on
fast
trains
and
the
--
we
are
told
that
that
shows
that
all
these
improved
schedules
could
be
achieved
without
merger.
well
now,
the
fact
is
and
the
commissions
referred
to
this
in
its
second
report,
not
the
--
it's
really
the
third
report,
it's
the
second
report
on
reconsideration.
these
trains
that
the
milwaukee
and
that
two
northern
lines
put
on
between
chicago
and
seattle
are
lightweight,
light
tonnage
trains
which
they
put
extra
power,
which
means
of
course
they're
carrying
--
they're
paying
more
for
every
ton
of
freight
they
carry
on
those
trains.
there's
one
of
those
trains
each
way,
each
day,
except
by
one
of
the
northern
lines
which
i
believe
skips
monday.
now,
in
contrast,
what
this
merger
will
do
will
be
is
provide
faster
schedules
for
the
fast
trains,
but
it's
going
to
provide
faster
schedules
for
all
the
trains,
the
regular
freight
trains
and
not
only
the
transcontinental
trains,
but
these
intermediate
trains.
so
that
the
suggestion
that
these
lightweight,
light
tonnage
trains
which
the
commission
took
into
account,
prove
that
the
carriers
can
do
these
improved
schedules
without
merger,
i
submit
is
not
really
supported
by
the
rational
consideration
of
the
evidence.
now,
the
other
kind
of
improvement,
the
two
other
things
i
should
like
to
mention,
one
is
the
improvement
in
car
supply,
which
this
merger
will
bring
which
is
a
very
serious
matter
in
this
part
of
the
country.
that
improvement
will
come
in
two
ways.
in
the
first
place,
the
improvement
in
schedules,
the
elimination
of
interchanges
and
the
elimination
of
switching
time,
turnaround
time
in
the
yards
is
going
to
make
more
cars
available
and
there's
a
reasoned
conservative
estimate
in
the
record
for
the
commission
that
this
will
mean
about
1700
additional
cars
daily,
which
will
be
available
for
loading.
now
that's
one
way
the
car
supply
will
be
improved.
another
way
it
will
be
improved
which
is
of
great
significance
is
that
under
--
when
the
lines
are
merged,
of
course
cars
will
be
centralized.
there'll
be
a
centralized
control
for
the
dispatch
and
distribution
of
the
cars.
today
there
is
evidence
to
this
kind
in
the
record.
those
lines
will
sometimes
stand
idle
on
one
of
the
lines,
while
the
point
not
too
far
away,
the
shipper
is
waiting
for
a
car.
well,
when
you
have
one
agency
distributing
those
cars
over
the
system
that
kind
of
things
certainly
be
reduced
and
maybe
eliminated.
now
the
third
thing
that
i
should
like
to
mention
about
these
service
benefits
because
--
so
that
the
court
will
get
some
sense
of
what's
in
this
record
is
a
mass
of
evidence
that
has
to
do
with
the
effect
of
improved
through
routes
and
single
line
service
which
is
often
in
many
cases,
some
commodities
are
cheaper
than
even
through
rates
by
two
railroad
and
the
transit
and
loading
and
unloading
privileges
which
this
merger
will
make
available
to
shippers.
now,
this
evidence
proves
and
it
rather
surprised
me
that
that
these
shippers
attached
great
importance
to
these
transit
and
loading
and
unloading
privileges.
what
they
mean
briefly
is
this.
that
if
a
shipper
ships
over
the
line
of
the
single
railroad
and
he
wants
to
stop
the
car
and
have
the
product
processed
in
some
way
and
then
move
on,
or
if
he
wants
to
send
--
start
out
a
car
half
loaded
and
then
load
it
completely,
or
if
he
wants
to
unload
it,
if
that
takes
place
on
the
line
of
a
single
railroad,
it
--
shipper
can
do
it
with
the
transfer
privilege
on
the
single
line
or
through
rate
which
is
an
advantageous
rate.
but
if,
when
he
stops
it
from
processing
or
loading
or
unloading,
he
wants
to
have
it
move
on
over
another
railroad,
he
pays
what
is
in
effect
a
higher
rate,
something
like
a
combination
rate.
now,
what
this
merger
does
is
to
make
those
privileges
available
to
system
wide.
they
are
not
now
because
the
northern
lines
don't
extend
this
kind
of
privilege
to
one
another,
but
available
over
the
entire
system
as
well
as
over
in
many
parts
of
the
milwaukee
as
a
result
of
the
conditions.
and
anyone
who
flavors
the
testimony,
even
in
the
examiner's
report
might
ask,
you
don't
have
to
go
on
the
record
to
see
what
importance
the
shippers
attached,
economic
importance,
to
these
particular
privileges.
they
open
up
markets
for
example.
they
will
enable
a
man
in
nebraska
who
hasn't
been
able
to
--
a
shipper,
a
lumber
shipper
in
the
first
instance
to
the
northwest
who
wants
to
have
lumber
processed
in
nebraska
and
sold
in
missouri
to
do
it
for
the
first
time
at
a
rate
which
will
enable
him
to
compete
with
lumber
moving
from
another
part
of
the
country.
now,
i
should
like
now
to
turn
although
i
have
to
some
extent
anticipated
myself
to
this
question
of
whether
these
things
can
be
done
without
merger.
i
have
talked
about
the
freight,
the
expedited
schedule.
i
think
mr.
kahn
has
made
the
point
which
was
not
i
think
left
entirely
clear
in
the
argument
this
morning
that
the
commission
did
make
some
findings
on
this.
the
--
they
made
the
findings
that
mr.
kahn
referred
to
and
the
examiner
made
a
finding
that
there
was
no
reasonable
expectation
that
these
railroads
could
achieve
these
improvements
in
service,
or
these
coordinations
if
they
remained
independent
competitors.
i
think
that
the
findings
that
the
commission
made
on
that
represent
one
area
of
agreement
between
the
first
and
the
second
reports,
because
in
the
first
report
the
majority
of
the
commission
there
said,
“we
agree
that
these
carriers
as
competitors
will
not
and
cannot
as
a
practical
matter
make
the
coordinations
from
which
they
derive
grossly
unequal
benefits.”
and
the
commission
in
the
second
report
found
that
most
of
these
instances,
these
coordinations
would
or
facilities
would
produce
grossly
unequal
benefits,
and
therefore
that
as
a
practical
matter,
it
was
not
reasonable
to
expect
the
railroads
to
make
them.
now
this
can
be
illustrated
and
again
to
give
you
some
flavor
of
the
record,
i
should
like
to
descend
into
details,
it
maybe
a
little
bit
variorum,
and
i
think
they
may
be
necessary.
one
of
the
things
that's
going
to
be
done
on
this
merger
is
to
coordinate
routes
so
that
the
trains
of
the
combined
system
move
over
the
best
and
most
expeditious
route.
for
example,
on
the
main
line
west,
the
main
route
will
be
composed
of
a
segment
of
the
line,
the
present
line
of
the
northern
pacific
from
the
twin
cities
to
a
point
in
north
dakota.
at
that
point,
the
traffic
will
move
on
to
what
is
now
the
main
line
of
the
great
northern,
which
is
a
much
better
line,
in
many
respects
and
will
move
on
the
line
of
the
great
northern
all
the
way
across
the
top
of
the
country
to
sandpoint
in
idaho.
at
that
point,
the
traffic
will
be
moved
over
to
a
line
of
the
northern
pacific
to
go
to
spokane,
and
then
from
spokane
it
will
move
on
to
the
coast
over
a
line
of
the
great
northern.
now,
if
you
stop
to
think
about
it
that
is
the
kind
of
thing,
they're
running,
they're
going
to
be
running
common
trains
that
cannot
be
done
by
two,
as
a
practical
matter,
by
two
independent
competing
companies.
despite
some
suggestions
this
morning
to
the
contrary,
the
commission
has
no
authority
to
compel
one
railroad
to
give
another
railroad
trackage
rights
over
its
line.
so
that
if
any
railroads
try
to
do
this,
there
would
have
to
be
arrangements
for
compensation
worked
out.
and
since
this
is
going
to
be
done
system
wide
on
all
the
routes,
what
you
would
have
to
think
about
would
be
the
two
railroads
sitting
down
to
decide.
they
were
going
to
run
trains
over
one
another's
routes,
perhaps
mixed
trains,
how
they
were
going
to
pay
one
another
for
the
--
on
a
fair
basis
for
the
advantages
that
each
got
out
of
it.
now,
i
submit
if
you
stop
to
think
about
that
quite
apart
from
the
practical
difficulties
which
would
i
think
would
make
the
exchange
ratio
look
easy,
apart
from
those,
you
couldn't
do
that
without
ending
what
would
practically
a
de
facto
pooling
of
revenues
and
sharing
of
profits.
and
that
relationship
could
hardly
be
consistent
with
really
effective
and
vigorous
competition
between
the
two
lines.
so
this
coordination
of
routes
--
as
a
commission
and
i
should
add
here
that
the
commission
in
the
first
report,
in
the
report
which
disapproved
the
merger,
the
commission
there
found
that
coordination
of
routes
between
competing
railroads
was
ordinarily
not
practical.
so
here
again,
there's
really
no
dispute
about
this.
now,
the
coordination
of
the
routes
is
an
essential
part
of
all
these
improvements
of
service.
it's
obvious
that
it
has
a
direct
relationship
with
the
schedules
of
the
car
supply,
but
it's
also
essential
to
the
coordination
of
these
terminal
facilities.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
in
order
to
construct
these
new
terminal
facilities,
you
have
to
rearrange
the
traffic.
you
have
difficulty
getting
ground
and
cities
usually
of
the
appropriate
kind
and
in
most
of
these
cities
the
two
railroads
come
into
the
city
from
different
directions
as
they
do
for
example
in
st.
paul.
so
that
what
as
an
essential
part
of
building
a
common
yard,
a
common
switching
and
assembly
yard,
the
trunk
line
traffic
has
to
be
moved.
as
i
explained
a
moment
ago,
all
of
that
trunk
line
traffic
in
st.
paul
is
going
to
come
in
to
st.
paul,
the
main
traffic,
east
and
west
over
a
line
of
the
northern
pacific.
now,
that
is
also
true
in
these
other
terminals
in
spokane
and
in
portland.
where
they
--
to
do
the
terminal
arrangements,
they
have
to
coordinate
the
routes,
really
they
have
to
run
mixed
trains.
now,
that
again
is
not
the
kind
of
saying
that
can
be
done,
these
yards
effectively
and
efficiently
between
two
competing
companies.
of
course
to
have
a
yard
in
which
there
are
two
companies
operating,
they're
both
--
each
other
is
going
to
be
want
to
be
sure
it
gets
its
trains
out
just
as
quick
as
the
other
fellow
does.
you'll
have
duplicate
yards,
duplicate
shipping
crews,
it's
a
switching
crews.
you
can't
do
these
things.
indeed,
there
is
here
i
think
a
strange
internal
inconsistency
in
the
argument
of
the
anti-trust
division
which
i
think
is
worse
comment.
if
you
did,
could
do
all
these
things,
these
by
voluntary
coordinations
between
the
carriers,
what
you
would
have
would
be
the
two
carriers
running
mixed
or
combined
trains
with
common
crews,
over
each
other's
routes
using
common
terminals
and
common
repair
facilities,
in
some
degree,
presumably
using
a
managerial
staff
in
common.
they'd
still
have
to
have
a
common
agency
distributing
the
freight
cars.
you
would
have
a
relationship,
a
cooperative
relationship
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
existence
of
the
kind
of
competition
that
the
anti-trust
division
says
it
should
be
preserved.
and
indeed,
it
somewhat
surprises
me
to
hear
them
taking
this
line
in
this
case
because
in
other
context,
they
have
frequently
pointed
out
the
dangers
and
indeed
the
illegality
that
will
arise
from
these
cooperative
and
joint
undertakings,
which
is
exactly
what
they
seem
to
be
arguing
for
here.
i
think
that
i
should
now
like
to
speak
briefly
to
the
--
to
one
matter
and
leave
it
without
much
comment
and
that's
the
matter
of
the
savings
to
the
railroad.
i
should
merely
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
direct
relationship
between
the
improvements
in
service
and
of
the
savings
because
the
savings
come
in
large
part,
not
entirely,
but
in
large
part
from
the
coordination
of
facilities
and
from
the
quicker
routes
and
the
other
steps
that
will
produce
the
better
service
to
the
shippers.
so
that
it
is
a
mistake
to
think
of
these
savings
as
being
of
only
in
direct
benefit
to
the
shippers,
because
they
do
have
a
direct
relationship
to
the
service
improvements.
but
apart
from
that
the
commission
made
findings
which
all
relate
to
matters
that's
entitled
to
give
weight
to
under
section
5
(2),
which
pointed
out
that
the
savings
would
increase
the
pressure
--
decrease
the
pressure
for
rate
increases
which
comes
from
increasing
costs
that
they
would
--
by
improving
the
rate
of
return
of
the
carriers
put
them
in
a
better
position
to
buy
a
modern
and
improved
equipment,
and
that
they
would
increase
their
capacity
and
power
to
compete
with
the
trucks,
which
is
--
and
other
modes
of
transportation.
now
the
department
of
justice
as
i
said
in
the
beginning
seems
to
admit
these
are
---
these
benefits
exist
in
a
way,
but
it
says
that
they
really
are
not
important
as
against
the
loss
of
competition
will
be
caused
by
the
merger
of
the
two
northern
lines.
and
as
i
said
earlier,
their
view
seems
to
be
that
almost
as
a
matter
of
law
you
need
something
beside
improvements
in
transportation
services
and
facilities,
you
need
something
over
and
above
and
beyond
that
of
a
more
extraordinary
character.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
am
not
exactly
the
man
to
develop
that.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
they
give
two
examples
although
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
a
failing
carrier,
the
other
one
is
where
you
have
two
prosperous
carriers,
but
there
you
need
to
put
them
together
so
they
can
service
--
save
a
third
failing
carrier
like
the
new
haven
now
in
the
penn-central
case.
do
you
follow
me
on
that?
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
those
are
the
only
two
examples
that
they
have
given
us
and
there's
a
footnote
in
their
reply
brief
which
to
some
degree
casts
doubt
on
what
--
whether
they
--
what
they
really
mean
about
the
failing
carrier,
but
that's
as
far
as
i
can
go,
i
regret
to
say
it
in.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that
is
their
position.
now
we've
developed
this
legal
argument
in
our
brief
and
i
don't
want
to
retread
what
mr.
kahn
has
said,
but
we
point
out
in
our
brief
a
number
of
things
about
that
argument.
one
is
that
the
act
itself
almost
by
term
shows
that
congress
was
not
prepared
to
rely
upon
competition
producing
its
benefits.
and
we
all
--
we
point
out
specifically
that
in
the
adequacy
of
transportation
service
is
one
of
the
four
things
in
section
5
(2)
(c)
that
the
commission
is
required
to
give
weight
to
when
it
is
asked
to
consider
a
merger,
and
we
also
point
out
that
the
national
transportation
policy,
which
of
course
pervades
in
the
degree
the
interpretation
of
the
provisions
of
the
acts,
speaks
in
terms
of
efficient,
economical,
adequate
and
safe
transportation
service.
now,
it
is
our
view
that
you
look
at
the
statute
and
you
look
at
the
provisions
of
the
statute,
the
very
kinds
of
benefits
that
this
case
produces
to
shippers
are
the
kinds
of
benefits
that
the
congress
authorized
the
commission
to
consider,
and
if
it
had
a
reasoned
judgment
on
the
matter
and
evidence
to
support
it,
could
decide,
justify
the
merger
that
suppressed
substantial
competition.
and
of
course
we
argue
too
from
the
mclean
case
and
the
sea
board
case
particularly
that
they
were
precisely
cases
of
that
kind.
that's
what
the
commission
did
and
this
court
sustained
it.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
don't
think
they
would
go
that
far,
but
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
when
they're
--
well,
i
couldn't
honestly
say
that
i
could
read
their
briefs
that
way.
i
--
as
i
have
said
before,
i
have
some
difficulty
in
getting
it
and
analyzing
it
precisely,
but
i
would
say
they
do
say
that
you
can't
ever
have
a
merger
in
that
situation
unless
you
have
some
very
extraordinary
and
special
benefit
that
goes
far
beyond
improvements
of
service.
and
the
only
two
i
know
anything
about
are
the
new
haven
situation
or
the
bankrupt
carrier
that's
a
--
now,
mr.
kahn
has
discussed
the
competitive
effect
of
this
merger
was
particularly
with
the
view
to
suggesting
that
the
department
has
exaggerated
the
quantitative
extent
to
which
competition
is
affected,
and
i
don't
want
to
cover
any
of
that
ground
again.
there
are
some
things
about
the
competitive
situation
that
i
think
it
might
be
useful
for
me
to
speak
very
briefly.
one
of
them
asked
the
--
they
really
relate
not
so
much
to
the
quantity
of
competition
that
is
eliminated,
but
to
the
economic
significance
of
that
elimination
and
particularly
economic
significance
in
relation
to
the
adequacy,
efficiency
and
economy
of
transportation
services
because
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
here
that
we,
at
least
in
our
view,
are
not
operating
under
a
statute
which
gives
the
competition
as
such
or
in
the
abstract
some
overriding
and
controlling
importance.
it
is
an
important
consideration
and
the
commission
treated
it
as
being
important,
but
it's
important
as
it
relates
to
the
contribution
it
makes
to
good
and
improved
transportation
services.
now,
so
that
economic
consequences
in
that
sense
to
which
i
wish
to
speak
very
briefly,
the
committee
--
the
argument
for
the
department
of
justice
i
think
rolls
together
a
number
of
things,
specifically
two
of
them
particularly
which
are
quite
different.
i
think
this
has
been
clear,
but
i
should
like
to
be
sure
it's
clear.
they
take
the
traffic
at
points
where
there
are
only
the
two
northern
lines
and
they
combine
that
with
the
points
at
which
there
are
the
two
northern
lines
and
one
or
more,
sometimes
three
or
four
other
railroads.
now
of
course
the
effect
of
this
merger
at
those
points
is
quite
different,
there's
a
significant
difference.
at
the
points
where
you
have
only
the
northern
lines,
the
two
northern
lines,
you
remove
all
way
of
competition
by
this
merger,
but
those
points
are
not
significant
enough,
either
in
terms
of
value
of
--
on
the
volume
of
traffic
produced,
or
in
the
markets
they
serve
to
support
the
argument
on
the
other
side,
so
they
have
to
combine
the
6%
of
the
revenues
that
come
from
points
of
that
kind,
that
is
where
there
are
only
the
two
northern
lines,
with
the
revenues
from
the
points
where
there
are
other
railroads
in
addition
to
the
northern
lines.
and
it's
that
way
they
derive
their
percentage
of
43
or
44%
which
is
said
to
be
the
effect
of
the
extent
to
which
it
eliminates
competition
at
least
on
a
station
basis.
now,
i
have
said
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two
situations
and
it's
obvious,
it
is
the
question
i
suppose
really
is,
if
you
eliminate
one
of
three
or
four
railroads,
how
economically
significant
is
that
in
this
industry
in
relation
to
the
service
and
the
rate
the
shipper
will
get?
it
--
true,
it
is
an
elimination
or
a
reduction
of
competition,
but
there's
nothing
in
this
record
that
suggests
in
any
way
that
the
elimination
of
one
of
several
competing
railroads
in
this
industry
has
effects
that
are
quite
as
devastating
on
railroad
service
and
railroad
rates,
as
the
argument
on
the
other
side
suggests.
and
there's
some
pretty
hard
empirical
evidence
that
points
in
the
contrary
direction,
that
is
the
evidence
of
the
shippers.
now,
there
are
large
number
of
shippers
who
testified
here,
and
a
great
many
of
these
shippers
came
from
these
points
where
there
will
be
a
reduction
by
one
in
a
number
of
railroads
serving
the
points.
yet
all
of
these
shippers,
practically
unanimous,
all
of
these
shippers
while
saying,
“competition
is
a
good
thing,
and
we
like
competition,”
all
of
them
supported
this
merger
particularly
as
it
was
conditioned
to
protect
the
milwaukee
and
the
northwestern.
now
that
evidence
seems
to
me
to
indicate
pretty
clearly
that
the
shippers
at
least,
so
long
as
they
have
two
or
more
railroads,
believe
that
the
benefits
of
this
merger
to
them
in
their
pragmatic
judgment,
the
benefits
of
this
merger
to
them
are
economically
more
consequence
than
the
elimination
of
one
railroad
out
of
several
at
these
points.
now
i
--
that
is
not
of
course
is
not
a
question
to
be
decided
essentially
by
a
pool
of
shippers,
but
certainly
the
unanimity
of
the
support
from
the
shippers
is
pretty
persuasive
evidence
that
looking
at
economic
consequences,
there
was
nothing
unreasonable
in
the
judgment
that
the
commission
made
here.
i
think,
since
i
have
mentioned
the
shipper
testimony,
i
should
say
one
thing
more
about
it
because
it
--
this
shipper
testimony
on
several
aspects
of
the
case
is
rather
embarrassing
to
the
anti-trust
division
and
in
their
reply
brief
they
suggest
that
the
court
really
shouldn't
pay
any
attention
to
it
because
--
well
they
say
that
perhaps
the
shippers
were
brainwashed
by
the
railroads
and
they
also
suggest
that
they
are
frightened
of
the
railroad.
well,
as
to
the
first
question,
the
first
suggestion,
i
merely
observe
that
there
were
200
and
--
more
than
200
of
these
shippers
and
about
39
associations
representing
shippers
who
testified,
they
were
cross-examined.
the
examiner
accepted
their
evidence
as
credible
and
persuasive
and
there's
plenty
of
evidence
in
this
record
that
they
don't
hesitate
to
litigate
and
to
oppose
the
railroads
when
they
want
to.
in
fact
they
bitterly
opposed
the
railroads
in
the
first
hearing
in
this
case
on
the
question
of
milwaukee
conditions.
but
there
really
isn't
any
basis
for
the
suggestion
that
the
railroads
brainwashed
them.
the
suggestion
we
frightened
them
rests
on,
apparently
on
a
footnote
citation
of
an
article
by
a
professor
in
the
trade
journal.
rather
a
remarkable
attempt
to
discredit
at
a
large
number
of
witnesses
by
a
rather
feeble
weapon,
i
think,
but
i
suggest
that
the
--
that
these
witnesses
deserve
consideration
and
weight
as
was
given
to
them
both
by
the
examiner
and
by
the
commission.
now
there
are
two
other
things
about
the
economic
consequences
of
the
elimination
of
competition
that
will
be
eliminated
here
that
i
think
are
significant.
one
has
been
referred
to
which
is
the
conditions
for
the
milwaukee.
and
i
merely
say
about
that,
that
while
the
department
attempts
to
dismiss
the
milwaukee
as
a
weak
and
ineffective
competitor,
again
there
is
ample
testimony
in
this
record
from
the
shippers
that
the
milwaukee
has
been,
even
without
the
conditions,
an
effective
competitor.
and
there's
also
evidence
that
they
expect
with
the
conditions
as
--
that
it
will
be
an
even
more
effective
competitor,
and
there's
no
doubt
about
the
effective
--
what
those
conditions
will
do
to
its
competitive
power.
it's
true
it
doesn't
have
as
much
money
as
the
northern
lines.
it
doesn't
have
as
big
a
volume
of
traffic,
isn't
as
large,
but
those
facts
do
not
mean
that
the
company
is
an
ineffective
competitor.
indeed
if
i
may
take
somewhat
the
same
line
i
took
a
moment
ago,
i
have
often
heard
the
anti-trust
division
attached
great
importance
to
the
activities
of
small
competitors
on
the
ground
that
they
make
up
in
hunger,
ambition
and
enterprise
for
their
lack
of
resources.
well,
the
milwaukee
here
is
certainly
has
been
and
will
be,
i
think
on
the
basis
of
the
facts,
an
effective
competitor.
the
other
thing
that
i
should
like
to
mention
before
the
court
rises
is
the
question
of
intermodal
competition
which
again
as
i
think
has
been
dismissed
by
the
department
of
justice
without
a
recognition
of
what
the
record
shows.
here
again,
the
evidence
is
there's
a
great
deal
of
particularized
evidence
on
what
trucks
are
dong
in
this
part
of
the
united
states.
there
may
not
be
as
much
truck
competition
in
the
northwest
as
there
is
in
the
northern
tier
as
there
is
elsewhere,
but
there's
enough
of
it
to
exert
a
very
direct
and
heavy
pressure
on
these
railroads
competitively.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
testimony
from
some
of
these
shippers,
and
along
this
the
citations
in
one
place
of
shippers
who
said,
“the
real
competition
today
is
not
the
rate
competition
is
not
between
the
railroads
and
the
other
railroads,
it's
between
the
trucks
and
the
railroads.”
and
as
far
as
these
agricultural
commodities
are
concerned,
the
bulk
commodities,
there's
particularized
evidence
that
trucks
are
moving
in
increasing
quantities
grain,
agricultural
commodities,
lumber,
paper
products,
lime,
salt,
a
whole
range
of
bulk
products
which
one
time
were
thought
to
be
immune
to
truck
competition,
and
of
course
no
one
disputes
that
they
are
moving
--
have
been
moving
large
quantities
of
the
merchandise
traffic,
which
is
the
traffic
that
the
move
to
the
large
part
into
this
territory
instead
of
out
of
it.
the
trucks
have
improved
their
time
schedules
as
i
made
the
reference
to
the
milwaukee
situation
a
moment
ago,
and
they're
building
highways
so
that
their
time
between
the
twin
cities
and
the
west
coast
in
some
instances
will
be
less
than
that
of
the
railroads
today.
so
that
this
--
the
trucks
which
also
serve
these
points,
not
only
they
serve
the
points,
not
only
where
there
are
railroads
left,
but
they
serve
the
points
where
there
will
be
one
railroad
left
and
they
provide
effective
and
direct
competition
today
which
in
its
strength
and
vigor
is
sufficiently
compensates
for
the
loss
of
one
railroad
at
the
points
where
there
are
several
railroads.
now,
i've
taken
these
things
together.
i
should
like
to
suggest
to
this
point
in
the
argument,
i
believe
it
was
that,
that
the
--
when
the
commission
made
this
balancing
--
went
through
the
balancing
process
in
its
second
report,
which
is
what
it
did.
it
did
not
depreciate
the
value
of
competition,
but
as
compared
with
what
it
did
in
the
first
report
it
engaged
in
a
more
thoughtful
and
detailed
analysis
of
what
kind
of
competition
would
be
left,
very
important,
and
what
the
economic
significance
to
the
competition
that
was
eliminated
really
was.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
oh,
certainly,
the
milwaukee
conditions
of
course
were
in
a
direct
bearing
on
the
competitive
situation
as
did
the
northwestern
conditions,
and
those
were
--
that
was
an
important
factor
as
was
the
labor
conditions
were
also
important,
but
i
was
speaking
largely
of
the
consideration
of
the
competitive
balance
between
competition
and
the
loss
of
competition
and
the
benefits,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that
is
quite
so,
and
of
course
there
were
three
members
of
the
commission
who
did
change
their
minds,
three
who
didn't,
who
had
voted
for
the
merger
in
the
first
case
and
two
new
appointees
who
came
to
it
fresh
and
voted
for
the
merger
and
that
was
how
the
majority
of
eight
was
composed
on
the
second
court.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
morning
i
shall
discuss
the
exchange
ratio.
the
negotiations
over
that
ratio
extended
for
more
than
three-and-a-half
years
and
as
it
was
observed
yesterday,
each
of
the
two
companies
here
was
advised
by
an
independent
firm
of
investment
bankers:
northern
pacific
by
morgan
stanley
and
the
great
northern
by
first
boston.
now,
as
mr.
dailey
indicated,
one
of
the
perhaps
the
greatest
problem
in
these
negotiations
was
the
natural
resource
properties
in
northern
pacific.
it
was
agreed
by
everyone
on
both
sides
of
the
bargaining
table
that
if
you
looked
at
merely
railroad
properties
and
railroad
earnings,
the
great
northern
was
entitled
to
a
very
substantial
premium
in
this
change
ratio.
but
the
northern
pacific’s
decision
was
that
its
natural
resource
properties
entitled
it
to
apparent
share-for-share.
the
great
northern
took
the
position
that
that
was
not
the
case.
it
said,
even
with
the
natural
resource
earnings
based
on
historical
record
of
earnings,
it
was
entitled
to
a
substantial
preference
in
this
exchange
ratio
and
it
took
different
positions
about
the
amount
of
that
preference,
but
toward
the
end
of
the
negotiations
it
said
that
it
thought
that
giving
due
allowance
to
the
natural
resources,
it
was
entitled
to
about
a
20%
premium.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no,
it
is
from
industrial
properties,
but
i
think
that
you
can
fairly
say
as
a
general
matter
that
its
earnings
represent
earnings
from
railroad
activities.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
it
has
some
industrial
real
estate
and
some
properties
of
that
kind
but
nothing
like
to
properties
of
the
northern
pacific.
i
think
that
has
to
be
said.
this
went
on
until
1960,
that
kind
and
i
think
this
is
rather
significant,
the
banking
advisers
of
northern
pacific,
morgan
stanley
suggested
the
compromise
was
finally
adopted
which
the
exchange
ratio
that
the
parties
agreed
to.
now,
that
was
described
yesterday.
i
merely
would
like
to
say
this
about
the
ratio.
the
reasoning
that
underlies
it
is
that
it
gives
the
shareholders
of
northern
pacific
in
the
long
term
and
equal
share
in
the
equity
of
this
new
company.
but
at
the
same
time
it
gives
an
immediate
but
not
a
lasting
recognition
through
this
preferred
stock
to
the
historical
fact
that
the
earnings
and
dividends
of
the
great
northern
had
been
greater
than
the
exchange
ratio
was
established.
now
this
compromise
proposed
by
morgan
stanley
was
approved
by
both
investment
banking
houses
by
the
board
of
directors
of
each
company
and
it
was
twice
approved
by
the
stockholders
of
northern
pacific.
once
in
1961
and
once
last
year
in
1968,
and
each
occasion
it
was
approved
by
73%
of
stockholders,
the
first
time
are
about
6%
of
the
stockholders
who
voted
against
it,
the
second
time
about
2%
of
the
stockholders
who
voted
against
it.
i
think
it
must
be
said
about
the
2%
to
decline
in
that
vote.
but
the
committee
conducted
a
proxy
fight
and
that
they
did
ask
that
those
who
favored
their
point
of
view
not
vote
as
well
as
vote
against.
so
that
no
doubt
that
the
part
accounted
for
they
declined
in
the
vote.
but
the
committee
in
the
proxy
fight
presented
all
the
arguments
that
they
have
presented
here.
now
the
commission
and
the
trial
examiner
both
bound
that
this
ratio
was
just
and
reasonable.
the
commission
found
that
it
fairly
represented
the
contribution
that
each
group
or
shareholders
has
made
to
the
new
enterprise.
i
emphasize
that
fact
because
i
think
the
impression
might
have
been
left
for
the
court
yesterday
that
commission
based
its
approval
of
the
ratio
solely
on
the
finding
that
there
was
arm’s
length
bargaining.
well,
it
did
find
that
there
have
been
arm’s
length
bargaining
but
it
also
made
this
finding
on
the
fair
contribution
to
the
--
to
the
new
company
by
each
group
of
shareholders.
the
findings
that
were
made
by
the
commission
on
fairness
to
ratio,
we
submit
are
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
evidence
to
the
--
that
supported
the
commission’s
finding
that
this
ratio
fairly
represented
the
contribution
made
by
each
group
of
shareholders.
the
ratio
was
based
by
--
and
it
got
finally
on
an
appraisal
of
earnings
both
on
appraisal
of
the
past
earnings
to
which
there
was
evidence
before
the
parties
and
which
was
before
the
commission,
and
a
judgment
about
the
earnings
in
the
future
including
the
earnings
of
the
natural
resources
properties.
the
parties
didn’t
use
any
arithmetical
formula
but
they
reached
a
judgment
about
that
and
established
the
exchange
ratio
accordingly.
now,
the
committee
seems
to
make
really
two
points
about
the
evidences
complaining
the
fact
that
the
ratio
wasn’t
based
on
asset
appraisal
of
the
market
value
of
these
properties.
they
suggested
there
was
really
no
evidence
about
that
before
the
commission,
but
i
think
that
is
not
quite
a
complete
count
of
what
did
happen.
there
was
each
of
the
railroads
here
got
independent
as
said
appraisals
from
independent
firms
are
the
more
important
to
these
properties.
and
then
their
direct
testimony
before
the
commission,
the
executive
of
the
railroad
applicants
testified
about
these
appraisals
and
explained
why
they
didn’t
use
them
in
establishing
the
exchange
ratio.
the
committee
asked
the
appraisals
and
they
were
produced
and
the
committee
put
them
an
evidence
before
the
commission.
so
the
commission
had
some
evidence,
had
the
evidence
about
the
asset
appraisals
and
also
testimony
about
why
they
weren’t
used.
they
weren’t
used
because
they
were
in
parties’
judgment
they
were
not
as
reliable
earnings,
there
were
enormous
differences
between
them,
and
even
the
independent
firms
who
made
them
in
some
instances
said
they
weren’t
sure
that
they
reflected
market
value.
the
committee
also
complains
that
not
enough
weight
was
given
to
the
earnings
of
the
natural
resource
properties
of
the
northern
pacific.
it
says
they
should’ve
been
valued
at
50
times
earnings
or
perhaps
to
22-1/2
times
earnings.
but
i
submit
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
required
the
commission
to
accept
those
particular
arithmetical
formulas
as
a
standard
for
judging
the
legality
of
this
exchange
ratio.
the
50
times
earnings
at
the
time
is
testified
to
would
have
produced
a
value
for
the
natural
resources
property
of
the
northern
pacific
alone,
which
was
$90
million
than
the
--
higher
than
the
total
stock
market
value
of
the
entire
enterprise
including
the
railroad
properties.
it
would
have
produced
evaluation
that
was
$280
million
more
than
the
amount
to
the
committee
proposed
that
these
properties
be
sold
for
in
connection
with
the
divestiture
proposal
of
the
committee
put
before
the
commission,
so
that
the
formula
really
didn’t
come
within
any
measurable
distance
of
reality.
the
22-1/2
times
formula
if
it
applied
to
the
five
years
before
1960
when
the
exchange
ratio
was
determined
produces
an
exchange
ratio
that
a
little
less
favorable
to
the
northern
pacific
stockholders
than
they
want
--
than
the
ratio
they
actually
received.
that’s
true
if
you
applied
in
some
more
recent
years.
now,
the
committee
can
apply
up
to
certain
years
and
get
the
results
that
they
say
show
that
the
ratio
was
unfair
and
these
computations
are
in
our
brief
--
in
their
brief.
i'm
inclined
to
think
that
what
they
show
is
that
with
one
of
these
arithmetical
formulas,
you
can
get
different
results
to
apply
them
to
different
years.
but
the
fact
is
that
there
was
substantial
evidence
before
the
commission
about
all
the
matters,
to
parties
considered
in
relation
to
earnings,
the
various
things
that
affected
earnings
past
and
what
would
might
affect
them
in
the
future
to
indicate
that
this
exchange
ratio
had
a
substantial
basis
and
that
evidence
was
all
before
the
commission
and
they
discussed
in
detail
were
about
28
pages
and
examiner’s
report
about
11
pages
and
the
commission’s
report
that
sets
out
this
evidence.
now,
what
i
have
said
about
the
finding
as
to
the
fairness,
the
contribution
that
each
group
of
shareholders
made
to
the
company.
i
think
could
also
be
said
about
the
finding
that
there
was
arm’s
length
bargaining.
both
the
examiner
and
the
commission
made
that
finding
and
the
examiner
made
it
after
hearing
testimony
from
the
executives
who
participated
in
these
negotiations
and
from
the
representatives
of
the
banking
house
which
participated
and
advised
the
two
companies.
i
think
that
i
understand
what
the
--
that
is
the
point
of
view
is,
i
think
they
believe,
no
doubt
sincerely
that
the
commission
they
have
given
too
much
weight
to
some
evidence
and
not
enough
weight
to
another
--
other
or
that
perhaps
for
variant
inferences
to
the
inferences
that
the
examiner
and
the
commission
drew
from
the
evidence.
but,
i
think
it
cannot
be
said
really
that
these
findings
lack
support
and
substantial
evidence
in
the
record.
now,
the
committee
makes
another
contention
which
was
referred
to
briefly
yesterday
and
that
is
that
the
commission
abused
its
discretion
in
1968
when
it
didn’t
reopen
this
record
and
that
retry
the
issue
of
the
fairness
to
the
exchange
ratio.
we
have
discussed
that
point
in
our
brief
and
replied
to
the
showings
that
they
have
made
was
to
change
conditions
with
the
analysis
to
those
conditions
which
we
submit
that
shows
that
the
matters
on
which
they
rely
do
not
really
support
the
argument
that
the
commission
abused
its
discretion.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
