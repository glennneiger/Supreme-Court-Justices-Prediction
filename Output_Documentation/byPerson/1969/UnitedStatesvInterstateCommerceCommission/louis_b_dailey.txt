mr.
louis
b.
dailey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
our
appeal
is
from
the
three-judge
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
unanimously
affirming
--
unanimously
dismissing
our
complaint
in
an
action
seeking
to
annul,
set
aside
and
restrain
the
enforcement
of
two
interstate
commerce
commission
orders
which
had
approved
the
merger
terms
and
it
also
affirmed
the
commission
orders.
my
remarks
will
be
directed
as
to
the
justice
and
propriety
of
the
stock
exchange
ratios
and
only
that.
now
there
are
certain
basic
practices
that
i
think
the
court
must
keep
in
mind
in
connection
with
our
appeal.
one
is
that
isn't
just
another
railroad
case
coming
down
or
up
the
legal
tracks.
northern
pacific
has
been
mentioned
here,
has
a
great
many,
very
vast
and
valuable
land
interests
containing
oil
and
gas,
timber,
coal,
iron,
ore
and
many
other
minerals
yet
un-found
in
an
area
that
is
about
as
large
as
massachusetts
and
connecticut
combined.
now
the
basic
character
of
northern
pacific
changed
after
1951
when
substantial
oil
was
found
in
the
williston
basin.
the
state
recognized
this
when
they
eliminated
northern
pacific
stock
from
the
dow
jones
rail
average.
the
1960,
to
give
you
an
idea
of
what
it
did
to
the
earnings.
in
1960,
a
few
take
their
earnings
of
northern
pacific
and
eliminate
the
burlington
dividend
which
was
substantial
of
the
remaining
earnings,
50%
of
that
came
from
natural
resources
and
50%
from
transportation
properties.
so,
that
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
a
very,
very
vital
matter
in
determining
stock
exchange
ratios.
now,
another
thing
that
you
must
keep
in
mind
on
this
appeal,
raised
a
new
problem
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
as
to
the
valuation
of
such
properties
quite
disparate
from
railroad
properties.
the
district
court
is
faced
with
this
new
problem
and
we
suggest
that
the
schwabacher
case,
no
other
railroad
case
has
this
court
been
faced
with
this
particular
problem.
now,
when
i
speak
in
this
case
of
the
parties,
i
will
refer
northern
pacific
as
np
and
the
great
northern
as
gn.
the
one
--
i
think
first
thing
we
should
do
is
simply
state
what
are
the
proposed
merger
terms
to
have
it
as
background?
under
the
terms
in
northern
pacific
stockholders
will
get
one
share
of
the
new
company's
common
stock
for
each
share
that
they
have,
same
for
great
northern,
but
in
addition,
the
great
northern's
going
to
get
a
half
of
share
of
a
$10
preferred
stock
which
must
be
redeemed
commencing
five
years
after
the
consummation
of
the
merger,
over
the
next
25
years,
4%
a
year.
but
it
has
a
call
provision
in
it
that
anytime
after
five
years
of
consummation
of
the
merger
that
it
maybe
redeemed.
but
the
thing
to
note
is
that
surely
northern
pacific's
stockholders
could
not
even
achieve
equality
with
this
great
northern
until
30
years
after
consummation
when
right
today
the
earnings
of
northern
pacific
are
greater
that
great
northern's.
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
yes,
it
might
be
$110,
i'm
not
sure
of
that
your
honor.
now,
i
come
to
the
first
point
and
that
is
this,
that
the
commission
in
the
district
court
have
committed
error
in
misinterpreting
what
the
standards
are
as
to
the
application
section
2,
subdivision
2
of
section
5,
interstate
commerce
act
that
perhaps
the
best
thing
to
do
is
quote,
first,
what
the
commission
said
and
then
what
the
district
court
said.
let
me
quote
from
the
commission,
this
is
in
297
of
your
appendix.
“the
issue
here
is
whether
the
exchange
ratios
are
just
and
reasonable
and
limited
thereto,
we
find
the
record
both
adequate
and
affirmative
in
that
they
either
necessary,
no
in
that
they
meet
the
necessary
and
required
tests,
one,
that
there
are
the
result
of
arms
length
bargaining
and
two,
that
they
fairly
reflect
the
contributions
of
each
group
of
stockholders
of
the
combined
system.”
that
was
the
basis
of
the
commission
decision.
now,
what
the
district
courts
say,
“on
the
basis
of
the
record
upon
which
the
commission
relied,
we
have
no
reason
to
rule
other
than
that
the
ratio
which
was
established
with
the
approval
of
the
companies
and
of
a
large
majority
of
their
stockholders
is
just
and
reasonable."
now,
let's
take
a
look
at
section
5.
there
are
really
three
steps
involved
in
the
achieving
a
railroad
mergers.
the
first
is
the
parties
have
to
agree
on
something.
second
is,
that
the
commission
then
takes
action
supposedly
independent
in
which
they
either
approve
these
terms
or
they
modify
them
under
section
5
(2)
to
achieve
what
the
test
is
of
justice
and
reasonableness.
and
the
third
thing
that
happens,
after
the
commission
is
all
through
of
the
case
then
you
must
have
assent
of
the
stockholders
by
an
appropriate
vote.
now,
the
court's
duty
is
one,
that's
quite
independent
of
any
agreement
of
the
parties
or
stockholder
approval.
parties
got
to
agree
before
otherwise
there
is
no
case.
and
the
stockholder
approval
is
only
in
there
having
to
do
with
relevant
as
to
the
enforcement
of
whatever
the
commission
has
found.
so
that
the
error
here
is
in
relying
for
the
decision
on
irrelevant
things
as
to
par
--
as
to
agreement
of
the
parties
in
the
first
place
and
the
subsequent
approval
by
the
stockholders.
this
we
claim
is
legal
error.now
there's
no
mention
of
section
5
of
arms
length
bargaining
and
et
al.
the
only
reference
in
section
5
et
al
is
in
subdivision
11
where
it
says
that
is
a
precondition
consummation,
you've
got
to
get
the
assent
of
the
stockholders.
in
re,
north
american
power
and
light,
the
circuit
court
in
the
third
district
held
in
a
public
utility
holding
case
that
the
presence
of
arm's
length
bargaining
is
not
a
decisive
criterion.
now,
although
we
claim
that
section
5
doesn't
make
arm's
length
bargaining
and
stockholders'
vote
and
necessary
required
test
under
5.
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
to
the
court
for
whatever
weight
or
relevant
you
think
these
two
factors
have
and
to
just
examine
what
the
record
says
about
this.
first,
let's
take
the
arm's
length
bargaining
business.
and
why
i
say
we
impute
no
fraud
or
chicanery
to
the
negotiator
of
these
terms.
these
are
responsible
people,
we
recognize
that.
but,
the
common
interest
switch
they
have
had
in
joint
ownership
of
the
burlington
running
back
to
91,
a
wholly
owned
ownership
of
the
sp&s
which
the
precedence
alternated
as
precedence
of
the
sp&s
and
the
joint
operations
of
the
montour
railway.
you
just
couldn't
have
these
kind
of
arm's
length
bargaining
which
i
think
any
court
would
consider
to
be
arm's
length
bargaining.
but
more
disturbing
importance
is
the
conflict
of
interests
that
shows
up
on
the
part
of
two
members
of
the
five
members
on
the
northern
pacific
consolidation
committee
which
was
the
negotiating
committee.
one
of
them,
this
is
in
exhibit
26
on
page
21,
one
of
them
owned
only
400
shares
in
northern
pacific,
but
he
was
a
vice-president,
director
of
a
hill
foundation,
what
did
that
hold?
not
a
single
share
of
northern
pacific
and
18
--
more
than
18,000
shares
of
great
northern.
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
no,
this
was
a
representation
by
the
man
on
the
board.
he
personally
demand
--
personally
owned
400
shares
of
the
northern
pacific
stock
and
none
in
great
northern,
but
--
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
i
think
the
court
will
be
able
to
judge
that
better
than
i,
mr.
chief
justice.
another
member
of
the
committee
had
--
was
the
president
of
two
mutual
funds.
one
of
them
had
to
be
large
amount
of
northern
pacific
stock
only,
but
the
second
one
had
only
13,000
northern
pacific
stock
and
over
46000
of
great
northern
stock.
now,
this
--
the
general
legal
definition
of
what
constitutes
market
value
and
this
court
in
schwabacher
posited
the
fact
that
the
true
criterion
was
the
present
intrinsic
or
market
value
of
the
contributions
being
made
by
the
various
groups.
having
that
in
mind,
the
general
legal
definition
is
what
would
knowledgeable
of
willing
traders
who
wanted
to
make
a
deal
in
a
trade
acting
under
no
compulsion
at
all,
what
would
--
what
figure
would
they
arrive?
now,
let's
take
a
look
at
that,
what's
in
this
record?
the
great
northern
had
testified
on
its
direct,
this
wasn't
crossed,
that
the
achievement
of
railroad
mergers,
of
the
railroad
properties
was
as
he
said,
“done
under
extreme
compulsion.”
the
president
of
the
northern
pacific
confirmed
this
on
his
direct.
he
characterized
and
used
a
very
accurate
adjective.
he
said
that
this
matter
of
achieving
railroad
consolidations
was
“the
overriding
consideration”
in
a
mortgage
act
--
in
this
merger
application.
now,
how
soft
the
bargaining
was
in
this
matter
is
shown
by
when
they
got
to
discussing
the
industrial
properties
both
--
which
both
railroads
had.
northern
pacific's
had
been
evaluated
at
$32,700,000,
so
they
weren't
talking
about
peanuts.
the
financial
adviser
for
northern
pacific
was
willing
to
take
merely
the
assurance
without
any
appraisals
of
the
gn
had
that
they
had
properties
of
very
substantial
character.
but
the
earnings
from
--
their
relative
earnings
from
this
particular
category
of
assets
in
1960
when
this
merger
terms
were
agreed
on,
northern
pacific's
were
twice
that
of
great
northern's.
so,
i
say
this.
if
i
--
this
is
arm's
length
bargaining.
the
record
shows
that
the
arms
were
exceedingly
short.
now,
about
the
stockholders'
vote;
a
lot
has
been
said
on
the
record
about
that.
i
think
the
stockholders'
vote
in
this
particular
case
should
be
a
red
flag
to
this
court
to
take
a
good
look
at
the
merit
side.
it
was
passed
by
a
vote
of
73.2%
of
those
entitled
to
vote.
it
was
the
lowest
vote,
next
to
the
lowest
vote,
the
(inaudible)
was
the
lowest
of
any
group
of
stockholders
in
all
of
the
railroad
mergers
that
have
recently
been
engaged
in.
it
came
only
after
they
had
to
adjourn
the
meeting
for
four
days
to
determine
the
outcome.
newspapers
called
it
a
cliffhanger.
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
i
--
the
report
--
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
they
sought
advice
of
those
two,
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
i'm
coming
to
that,
did
they
agree?
they
both
approved
the
terms,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
court.
before
i
proceed
with
the
argument,
i
would
like
to
answer
mr.
justice
potter's
question
about
the
provisions
of
the
--
someone
asked
about
the
call
provisions
of
the
preferred
stock
and
i'm
a
little
uncertain
about
--
is
that
you
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
they
are
redeemable
for
the
seeking
fund
purposes
at
par.
as
to
the
--
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
$10
fund.
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
half
of
shares,
see,
great
northern
gets
a
half
a
share.
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
five
dollars.
as
to
the
call
of
provisions,
provides
that
five
years
after
the
consummation,
the
redemption
price
would
be
105
for
the
first
two
years.
the
next
two
years,
it
would
be
on
104%,
and
then
after
that
in
the
descending
scale
until
that
the
--
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
no,
no.
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
105%
--
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
105%
of
the
part.
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
that's
right.
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
and
--
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
yes,
and
it
keeps
going
down
until
it's
redeemable
at
par
at
the
end
of
15
years.
now,
i
had
about
concluded
the
first
point,
as
to
the
misinterpretation
of
section
5
and
laying
stress
on
the
arm's
length
bargaining
and
the
stockholder's
votes.
i
now
wish
to
come
to
point
two
and
that
is
that
there's
just
no
reliable
probative
substantial
evidence
in
the
whole
record
to
support
the
finding
of
the
commission
in
the
district
court
that
these
terms
are
just
and
reasonable
under
section
5.
now
the
unique
problem
on
this
case
is
determining
merger
terms.
how
do
you
value,
weigh
and
relate
the
contributions
of
the
two
parties?
one
has
only
railroad
properties
and
the
other
has
railroad
properties
plus
these
vast
natural
resources,
some
of
which
are
not
currently
producing
income,
but
are
expected
to
in
the
future.
now,
there's
no
issue
in
this
question
about
the
valuation
of
railroad
properties.
committee
agrees
that
it's
proper
to
take
a
capitalization
of
earnings
because
they
are
not
readily
marketable
and
they
are
worth
only
what
they
can
earn.
committee
was
satisfied
with
the
60-40
gnnp
relationship
on
the
railroad
properties.
mr.
williams,
the
committee's
expert
came
up
with
the
price
earnings
ratio
of
15
times
earnings
in
1960
when
the
terms
were
agreed
upon
as
an
appropriate
one
and
that
hasn't
been
questioned
anywhere
in
the
record.
the
real
issue
is
how
are
you
going
to
value
these
natural
resources?
the
applicant's
position
on
that
on
the
record
was
that
it's
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
to
value
respective
stocks
except
on
the
basis
of
capitalization
of
earnings.
that
they
made
an
attempt
to
value
stocks
by
a
separate
valuation
and
they
found
it
impractical.
why?
because
they
couldn't
agree
on
the
stock
ratio
because
of
difficulty
of
valuing
these
properties
on
account
of
market
conditions
and
the
uncertainty
of
their
future
potential.
so
they
made
what
they
called
no
definitive
valuation
of
properties.
they
say
it
in
the
last
analysis,
it
just
has
to
be
a
question
of
judgment.
now,
the
committee's
position
was
and
is
that
you
arrive
at
a
proper,
the
intrinsic
stock
market
value
of
these
two
stocks
which
is
what
schwabacher
mandated
that
it's
more
appropriate
to
take
a
market
value
of
them
rather
than
measure
them
on
the
basis
of
capitalization
of
earnings.
but
if
you
do
take
current
earnings
and
capitalize
it,
that
in
the
market
place,
knowledgeable
traders
wind
up
with
a
very
high
price
earnings
ratio.
northern
pacific's
financial
adviser
agrees
with
the
committee.
let
me
read
to
you
from
exhibit
32,
page
3
which
is
morgan
stanley's
report
on
the
non-railroad
properties.
here's
what
they
say.
“in
essence,
however,
a
sale
of
interest
in
the
properties
would
take
place
to
create
northern
stockholders
and
on
this
basis,
northern
pacific
stockholders
should
realize
sale
value
rather
than
value
based
on
capitalization
of
earnings.”
and
the
committee
chairman
frankly
testified
on
his
direct
testimony
that
you
can't
make
any
exact
appraisal
in
dollars
of
these
properties.
we
claim
however
though,
although
it's
not
easy
to
value,
some
approximate
valuation
is
not
only
possible,
but
is
necessary
if
you're
going
to
sustain
merger
terms.
now,
what
was
the
applicant's
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
this
finding?
it's
based
largely
on
past
performances
to
earnings,
dividends,
stock
market
quotations
and
pro
forma,
dividend
comparisons
and
on
an
erroneous
and
gloomy
prediction
that
there
was
nothing
reasonably
foreseeable
to
indicate
that
northern
pacific's
future
earnings
prospects
were
better
than
great
northern's.
and
i'm
sure
the
court
is
aware,
my
former
statement,
in
the
last
two
years,
our
earnings
have
exceeded
great
northern's.
now,
the
gn's
financial
adviser,
first
boston's
witness
testified,
“the
study
of
past
performance
is
only
important
insofar
as
it
measures
or
predicts
future
prospects.”
this
was
his
direct
testimony.
with
that,
the
committee
agreed.
now,
the
applicant's
case
as
to
the
future
prospects
and
value
of
these
resources
is
based
on
evidence
that
we
regard
as
of
little
prohibitive
value
and
that's
the
test
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
they
offered
no
market
appraisals
for
these
properties.
they
put
on
the
stand,
no
timber,
oil
or
other
geologist
or
expert
on
these
matters
that
we
could
cross-examine,
there's
none
of
that.
both
financial
advisers
on
cross-examination
were
extremely
vague
as
to
past
prices
of
timber
and
oil.
in
other
words,
a
direct
case
of
the
applicants
was
largely
a
long
dreary
account
of
their
negotiation,
how
they
couldn't
agree
and
all
the
arguments
that
they
had
and
it
was
argument
that
largely
not
hard,
positive
reliable
evidence.
now,
contrast
the
committee's
case.
we
were
very
serious
in
this
proceeding.
we
were
observing
the
injunction
in
the
erie
case.
it
said
dissenting
stockholders
should
put
in
positive
evidence
and
should
state
precise
inequities.
we
had
this
constantly
in
mind.
so
that
when
we
put
in
our
direct
case,
we
had
three
experts
on
stock
evaluation
analysis
and
an
oil
geologist
that
were
subjected
to
searching
cross-examinations.
they
testified
as
to
various
factors
that
must
be
considered
when
you
get
to
valuing
what
the
traders
will
--
how
they
will
trade
these
natural
resources
and
properties
in
the
public
market?
mr.
brundage,
chairman
of
the
committee
testified
as
to
the
strong
earning
power
of
the
natural
resources,
improved
geological
and
geophysical
discovery
techniques,
the
freedom
of
these
properties
from
obsolescence
contrary
to
railroad
properties,
the
low
financial
risk,
the
very
high
return
on
capital
investment.
our
natural
resources
are
yielding
each
year
more
than
100%
of
the
return.
whereas
the
testimony
of
the
applicants
on
their
direct
case
was
that
northern
pacific
in
1960
gets
--
getting
a
return
of
1.4%
on
its
transportation
properties.
he
spoke
of
the
tax
savings
running
into
millions
of
dollars
occasioned
by
the
depletion
allowances.
he
spoke
of
the
control
elements
that
you
didn't
have
to
develop
properties
in
a
hurry.
you
could
take
your
time
and
you're
in
control
of
it
and
most
importantly,
he
spoke
of
the
intrinsic
and
the
survival
values
of
these
properties
in
an
inflationary
period.
now
mr.
williams
reported
on
his
studies
of
comparative
companies
that
had
similar
properties,
then
he
wound
up
with
a
price
earnings
ratio
in
his
judgment
was
50
times
earnings
and
this
was
never
been
questioned
by
any
testimony
on
the
part
of
the
applicants.
he
pointed
to
the
txl,
texaco
deal
which
happen
to
be
consummated
about
that
time.
it
was
a
merger
like
ours,
in
which
the
price
earnings
ratio
were
75
times
earnings.
now,
in
the
morgan
stanley
report
which
you
can
see
in
exhibit
32,
morgan
stanley,
in
making
their
recommendations
were
terms
favorable
to
northern
pacific
against
gn
came
up
with
price
earnings
ratio
of
12
on
oil
and
gas,
15
on
timber
and
15
on
other
minerals.
our
oil
geologist
that
was
particularly
familiar
with
the
williston
banking,
based
and
he'd
cut
his
eye
teeth
up
in
that
area,
testified
as
to
the
favorable
prospects
of
the
williston
basin.
he
predicted
a
billion
tons
of
oil
out
of
the
basin
in
the
next
decade.
he
spoke
of
a
use
of
the
exploration
there.
the
lack
of
the
exploration
of
the
deeper
layers
of
the
ground
that
pointed
out
that
in
the
williston
basin,
they'd
get
a
higher
rate
of
discovery
than
the
national
rate.
and
he
also
said
that
additional
income
from
the
oil
would
come
from
secondary
recoveries.
now,
mr.
story
testified
as
to
the
economic
matters
and
particularly
as
to
trends
of
prices
of
natural
resources
and
their
value
as
a
hedge
against
probable
future
monetary
inflation.
now,
the
important
thing
for
this
court
to
realize
is
that
this
body
of
specific
testimony
on
the
part
of
the
committee
was
never
rebutted.
they
had
--
the
applicants
had
morgan
stanley,
they
had
all
the
oil
experts
and
timber
experts
on
the
payroll.
thousands
of
our
stockholders'
money
was
paid
to
hire
them,
but
they
didn't
go
on
the
stand
and
say
that
mr.
william's
price
earnings
ratio
was
wrong
or
that
mr.
brundage's
testimony
as
to
the
various
factors
that
must
be
considered
in
the
marketplace
relating
to
our
natural
resources
were
improper
or
to
how
to
weigh
any
factors
that
pertain
to
these
natural
resources,
you
just
draw
a
blank
from
the
applicants
on
that
aspect.
so,
we
say
that
their
testimony
is
not
proven.
it
isn't
reliable.
no
experts,
nobody
to
get
at
the
truth.
now,
the
committee
doesn't
claim
that
exchange
ratios
can
be
based
on
exact
dollar
evaluations,
but
it
does
claim
that
there
must
be
some
rational
basis
in
the
record
for
any
alleged
just
ratio.
if
the
commission
is
to
discharge
its
duty
and
this
court
is
to
have
any
meaningful
review
of
the
record,
and
that
just
that
you
will
search
this
record
and
you
will
not
find
how
they
arrived
at
these
decisions
except
through
these
bargaining
process.
now,
the
committee
also
developed
calculations
to
show
they
were
precise
in
their
criticisms
of
these
terms.
they're
all
set
forth
on
three
different
theories
and
four
different
points
of
time,
there
were
12
different
computations
and
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
they
all
with
one
exception,
show
that
great
northern
should
be
preferred.
it's
all
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
and
i'm
sure
and
i
hope
you
will
study
it.
now,
this
record
contains
no
discussion
by
either
the
commission
or
the
district
court
of
this
expensive
testimony
of
the
committee.
or
was
any
rational
explanation
given,
set
forth
anywhere
as
to
how
the
particular
ratios
were
developed
or
could
be
justified.
we
urge
that
the
wholly
conclusionary
finding
of
the
commission
that
these
mergers
fairly
reflect
the
contributions
of
the
group
of
stockholders
involved
is
not
supported
by
reliable,
probative
and
substantial
evidence
as
the
administrator
procedure
requires.
now,
i
received
a
five-minute
warning
here.
our
third
claim
which
is
that
the
commission
grossly
erred
in
views
of
the
discretion,
denied
us
due
process
and
outlying
a
lot
of
evidence
of
new
evidence
that's
available
now
that
wasn't
then.
the
pierce
case
has
been
cited
here
as
it
--
by
the
district
court
as
support,
but
the
pierce
case
was
one
in
which
they
were
dealing
with
the
impact
of
war
inflation.
and
they
said
that
as
to
that
matter,
the
commission
was
--
that's
right
within
the
scope
of
their
particularized
expertise
and
that
therefore,
there
was
no
need
to
interrupt
them.
we've
--
we
concede
that
the
general
view
is
that
you
shouldn't
interfere
with
this,
but
the
adjacent
case
was
right
on
all
fours
with
us.
there
they
were
dealing
with
the
depression,
now
we're
dealing
with
inflation.
even
the
president
in
his
radio
speech
last
friday
drew
this
comparison.
so,
we
say
in
conclusion
that
on
no
basis
and
on
no
theory
does
the
record
sustain
the
finding
below
and
that
they
made
a
serious
error
when
they
took
the
wrong
test
and
applied
the
bargaining
process
and
the
stockholder's
vote
as
determined.
the
commission
simply
didn't
do
its
homework
on
this
case.
you're
going
to
find
difficulty,
i
think,
in
finding
in
this
record
any
rational
basis
to
sustain
what
has
been
found.
so,
in
conclusion,
i
would
like,
respectfully
ask
this
court
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
be
reversed
and
that
the
course
be
remanded
to
it
with
instructions
that
the
matter
be
remanded
that
the
commission
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
the
opinion
of
this
court.
now,
as
was
set
by
this
court
in
the
penn-central
case,
the
short
delay
occasioned
by
a
remand
is
not
too
high
a
price
to
pay
to
assure
a
disposition
of
this
matter
that
is
just
to
all
parties.
i
thank
you
for
earnest
consideration.
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
oral
argument
before
this
court,
the
proponents
of
the
merger
have
chosen
not
to
meet
the
committee’s
argument.
the
livingston
anti-merger
committee’s
argument
on
the
merits
and
have
chosen
to
rely
on
their
brief.
it
is
suggested
here
that
the
tide
of
difficult
arguments
of
economic
imponderables
largely
attached
to
the
antitrust
issue
not
be
allowed
to
sweep
away
the
arguments
of
the
livingston
anti-merger
committee.
in
closing
therefore,
it
would
seem
appropriate
to
note
once
more
that
the
livingston
anti-merger
committee
raises
the
threshold
that
issues
in
these
consolidated
cases.
if
the
court
finds
in
favor
of
the
livingston
anti-merger
committee
on
either
of
the
two
threshold
issues
which
it
had
raised,
the
arguments
of
economic
imponderables
become
moot.
in
summary,
the
livingston
anti-merger
committee
claims
that
ownership
of
the
federally
chartered
right
of
away
is
a
jurisdictional
element.
if
it
is
not
owned,
the
right
of
way
is
not
owned
by
a
merger
applicant
or
party
petitioning
for
inclusion
in
the
merger
and
the
committee
claims
that
isn’t,
the
commission
has
no
jurisdiction.
and
secondly,
even
assuming
the
commission
has
jurisdiction
over
the
proposed
merger
had
accept
in
railways
claim
of
title
to
the
federal
chartered
right
of
away.
the
merger
is
still
barred
by
statutory
law
in
contract.
it
is
barred
by
the
provisions
of
the
federal
charter
which
were
imposed
upon
the
road
when
congress
granted
the
road
in
the
first
place.
and
those
two
provisions,
there
are
two
provisions.
one
prohibits
some
merger
and
the
other
prohibits
mortgage
without
congressional
consent.
if
railways
succeeded
to
the
title
the
main
line
right
of
away
federally
chartered
to
railroad
then
a
railway
also
succeeded
to
the
liabilities
and
obligations
and
burdens
which
that
title
carry.
and
two
of
those
burdens,
is
no
merger
and
no
mortgage
without
congressional
consent.
icc
has
no
position
to
override
these
impositions.
these
are
impositions
that
have
been
placed
by
congress
in
the
federal
charter
which
congress
preempted.
i
see
my
time
is
up
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
our
appeal
is
from
the
three-judge
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
unanimously
affirming
--
unanimously
dismissing
our
complaint
in
an
action
seeking
to
annul,
set
aside
and
restrain
the
enforcement
of
two
interstate
commerce
commission
orders
which
had
approved
the
merger
terms
and
it
also
affirmed
the
commission
orders.
my
remarks
will
be
directed
as
to
the
justice
and
propriety
of
the
stock
exchange
ratios
and
only
that.
now
there
are
certain
basic
practices
that
i
think
the
court
must
keep
in
mind
in
connection
with
our
appeal.
one
is
that
isn't
just
another
railroad
case
coming
down
or
up
the
legal
tracks.
northern
pacific
has
been
mentioned
here,
has
a
great
many,
very
vast
and
valuable
land
interests
containing
oil
and
gas,
timber,
coal,
iron,
ore
and
many
other
minerals
yet
un-found
in
an
area
that
is
about
as
large
as
massachusetts
and
connecticut
combined.
now
the
basic
character
of
northern
pacific
changed
after
1951
when
substantial
oil
was
found
in
the
williston
basin.
the
state
recognized
this
when
they
eliminated
northern
pacific
stock
from
the
dow
jones
rail
average.
the
1960,
to
give
you
an
idea
of
what
it
did
to
the
earnings.
in
1960,
a
few
take
their
earnings
of
northern
pacific
and
eliminate
the
burlington
dividend
which
was
substantial
of
the
remaining
earnings,
50%
of
that
came
from
natural
resources
and
50%
from
transportation
properties.
so,
that
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
a
very,
very
vital
matter
in
determining
stock
exchange
ratios.
now,
another
thing
that
you
must
keep
in
mind
on
this
appeal,
raised
a
new
problem
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
as
to
the
valuation
of
such
properties
quite
disparate
from
railroad
properties.
the
district
court
is
faced
with
this
new
problem
and
we
suggest
that
the
schwabacher
case,
no
other
railroad
case
has
this
court
been
faced
with
this
particular
problem.
now,
when
i
speak
in
this
case
of
the
parties,
i
will
refer
northern
pacific
as
np
and
the
great
northern
as
gn.
the
one
--
i
think
first
thing
we
should
do
is
simply
state
what
are
the
proposed
merger
terms
to
have
it
as
background?
under
the
terms
in
northern
pacific
stockholders
will
get
one
share
of
the
new
company's
common
stock
for
each
share
that
they
have,
same
for
great
northern,
but
in
addition,
the
great
northern's
going
to
get
a
half
of
share
of
a
$10
preferred
stock
which
must
be
redeemed
commencing
five
years
after
the
consummation
of
the
merger,
over
the
next
25
years,
4%
a
year.
but
it
has
a
call
provision
in
it
that
anytime
after
five
years
of
consummation
of
the
merger
that
it
maybe
redeemed.
but
the
thing
to
note
is
that
surely
northern
pacific's
stockholders
could
not
even
achieve
equality
with
this
great
northern
until
30
years
after
consummation
when
right
today
the
earnings
of
northern
pacific
are
greater
that
great
northern's.
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
yes,
it
might
be
$110,
i'm
not
sure
of
that
your
honor.
now,
i
come
to
the
first
point
and
that
is
this,
that
the
commission
in
the
district
court
have
committed
error
in
misinterpreting
what
the
standards
are
as
to
the
application
section
2,
subdivision
2
of
section
5,
interstate
commerce
act
that
perhaps
the
best
thing
to
do
is
quote,
first,
what
the
commission
said
and
then
what
the
district
court
said.
let
me
quote
from
the
commission,
this
is
in
297
of
your
appendix.
“the
issue
here
is
whether
the
exchange
ratios
are
just
and
reasonable
and
limited
thereto,
we
find
the
record
both
adequate
and
affirmative
in
that
they
either
necessary,
no
in
that
they
meet
the
necessary
and
required
tests,
one,
that
there
are
the
result
of
arms
length
bargaining
and
two,
that
they
fairly
reflect
the
contributions
of
each
group
of
stockholders
of
the
combined
system.”
that
was
the
basis
of
the
commission
decision.
now,
what
the
district
courts
say,
“on
the
basis
of
the
record
upon
which
the
commission
relied,
we
have
no
reason
to
rule
other
than
that
the
ratio
which
was
established
with
the
approval
of
the
companies
and
of
a
large
majority
of
their
stockholders
is
just
and
reasonable."
now,
let's
take
a
look
at
section
5.
there
are
really
three
steps
involved
in
the
achieving
a
railroad
mergers.
the
first
is
the
parties
have
to
agree
on
something.
second
is,
that
the
commission
then
takes
action
supposedly
independent
in
which
they
either
approve
these
terms
or
they
modify
them
under
section
5
(2)
to
achieve
what
the
test
is
of
justice
and
reasonableness.
and
the
third
thing
that
happens,
after
the
commission
is
all
through
of
the
case
then
you
must
have
assent
of
the
stockholders
by
an
appropriate
vote.
now,
the
court's
duty
is
one,
that's
quite
independent
of
any
agreement
of
the
parties
or
stockholder
approval.
parties
got
to
agree
before
otherwise
there
is
no
case.
and
the
stockholder
approval
is
only
in
there
having
to
do
with
relevant
as
to
the
enforcement
of
whatever
the
commission
has
found.
so
that
the
error
here
is
in
relying
for
the
decision
on
irrelevant
things
as
to
par
--
as
to
agreement
of
the
parties
in
the
first
place
and
the
subsequent
approval
by
the
stockholders.
this
we
claim
is
legal
error.now
there's
no
mention
of
section
5
of
arms
length
bargaining
and
et
al.
the
only
reference
in
section
5
et
al
is
in
subdivision
11
where
it
says
that
is
a
precondition
consummation,
you've
got
to
get
the
assent
of
the
stockholders.
in
re,
north
american
power
and
light,
the
circuit
court
in
the
third
district
held
in
a
public
utility
holding
case
that
the
presence
of
arm's
length
bargaining
is
not
a
decisive
criterion.
now,
although
we
claim
that
section
5
doesn't
make
arm's
length
bargaining
and
stockholders'
vote
and
necessary
required
test
under
5.
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
to
the
court
for
whatever
weight
or
relevant
you
think
these
two
factors
have
and
to
just
examine
what
the
record
says
about
this.
first,
let's
take
the
arm's
length
bargaining
business.
and
why
i
say
we
impute
no
fraud
or
chicanery
to
the
negotiator
of
these
terms.
these
are
responsible
people,
we
recognize
that.
but,
the
common
interest
switch
they
have
had
in
joint
ownership
of
the
burlington
running
back
to
91,
a
wholly
owned
ownership
of
the
sp&s
which
the
precedence
alternated
as
precedence
of
the
sp&s
and
the
joint
operations
of
the
montour
railway.
you
just
couldn't
have
these
kind
of
arm's
length
bargaining
which
i
think
any
court
would
consider
to
be
arm's
length
bargaining.
but
more
disturbing
importance
is
the
conflict
of
interests
that
shows
up
on
the
part
of
two
members
of
the
five
members
on
the
northern
pacific
consolidation
committee
which
was
the
negotiating
committee.
one
of
them,
this
is
in
exhibit
26
on
page
21,
one
of
them
owned
only
400
shares
in
northern
pacific,
but
he
was
a
vice-president,
director
of
a
hill
foundation,
what
did
that
hold?
not
a
single
share
of
northern
pacific
and
18
--
more
than
18,000
shares
of
great
northern.
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
no,
this
was
a
representation
by
the
man
on
the
board.
he
personally
demand
--
personally
owned
400
shares
of
the
northern
pacific
stock
and
none
in
great
northern,
but
--
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
i
think
the
court
will
be
able
to
judge
that
better
than
i,
mr.
chief
justice.
another
member
of
the
committee
had
--
was
the
president
of
two
mutual
funds.
one
of
them
had
to
be
large
amount
of
northern
pacific
stock
only,
but
the
second
one
had
only
13,000
northern
pacific
stock
and
over
46000
of
great
northern
stock.
now,
this
--
the
general
legal
definition
of
what
constitutes
market
value
and
this
court
in
schwabacher
posited
the
fact
that
the
true
criterion
was
the
present
intrinsic
or
market
value
of
the
contributions
being
made
by
the
various
groups.
having
that
in
mind,
the
general
legal
definition
is
what
would
knowledgeable
of
willing
traders
who
wanted
to
make
a
deal
in
a
trade
acting
under
no
compulsion
at
all,
what
would
--
what
figure
would
they
arrive?
now,
let's
take
a
look
at
that,
what's
in
this
record?
the
great
northern
had
testified
on
its
direct,
this
wasn't
crossed,
that
the
achievement
of
railroad
mergers,
of
the
railroad
properties
was
as
he
said,
“done
under
extreme
compulsion.”
the
president
of
the
northern
pacific
confirmed
this
on
his
direct.
he
characterized
and
used
a
very
accurate
adjective.
he
said
that
this
matter
of
achieving
railroad
consolidations
was
“the
overriding
consideration”
in
a
mortgage
act
--
in
this
merger
application.
now,
how
soft
the
bargaining
was
in
this
matter
is
shown
by
when
they
got
to
discussing
the
industrial
properties
both
--
which
both
railroads
had.
northern
pacific's
had
been
evaluated
at
$32,700,000,
so
they
weren't
talking
about
peanuts.
the
financial
adviser
for
northern
pacific
was
willing
to
take
merely
the
assurance
without
any
appraisals
of
the
gn
had
that
they
had
properties
of
very
substantial
character.
but
the
earnings
from
--
their
relative
earnings
from
this
particular
category
of
assets
in
1960
when
this
merger
terms
were
agreed
on,
northern
pacific's
were
twice
that
of
great
northern's.
so,
i
say
this.
if
i
--
this
is
arm's
length
bargaining.
the
record
shows
that
the
arms
were
exceedingly
short.
now,
about
the
stockholders'
vote;
a
lot
has
been
said
on
the
record
about
that.
i
think
the
stockholders'
vote
in
this
particular
case
should
be
a
red
flag
to
this
court
to
take
a
good
look
at
the
merit
side.
it
was
passed
by
a
vote
of
73.2%
of
those
entitled
to
vote.
it
was
the
lowest
vote,
next
to
the
lowest
vote,
the
(inaudible)
was
the
lowest
of
any
group
of
stockholders
in
all
of
the
railroad
mergers
that
have
recently
been
engaged
in.
it
came
only
after
they
had
to
adjourn
the
meeting
for
four
days
to
determine
the
outcome.
newspapers
called
it
a
cliffhanger.
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
i
--
the
report
--
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
they
sought
advice
of
those
two,
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
i'm
coming
to
that,
did
they
agree?
they
both
approved
the
terms,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
court.
before
i
proceed
with
the
argument,
i
would
like
to
answer
mr.
justice
potter's
question
about
the
provisions
of
the
--
someone
asked
about
the
call
provisions
of
the
preferred
stock
and
i'm
a
little
uncertain
about
--
is
that
you
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
they
are
redeemable
for
the
seeking
fund
purposes
at
par.
as
to
the
--
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
$10
fund.
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
half
of
shares,
see,
great
northern
gets
a
half
a
share.
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
five
dollars.
as
to
the
call
of
provisions,
provides
that
five
years
after
the
consummation,
the
redemption
price
would
be
105
for
the
first
two
years.
the
next
two
years,
it
would
be
on
104%,
and
then
after
that
in
the
descending
scale
until
that
the
--
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
no,
no.
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
105%
--
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
105%
of
the
part.
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
that's
right.
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
and
--
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
yes,
and
it
keeps
going
down
until
it's
redeemable
at
par
at
the
end
of
15
years.
now,
i
had
about
concluded
the
first
point,
as
to
the
misinterpretation
of
section
5
and
laying
stress
on
the
arm's
length
bargaining
and
the
stockholder's
votes.
i
now
wish
to
come
to
point
two
and
that
is
that
there's
just
no
reliable
probative
substantial
evidence
in
the
whole
record
to
support
the
finding
of
the
commission
in
the
district
court
that
these
terms
are
just
and
reasonable
under
section
5.
now
the
unique
problem
on
this
case
is
determining
merger
terms.
how
do
you
value,
weigh
and
relate
the
contributions
of
the
two
parties?
one
has
only
railroad
properties
and
the
other
has
railroad
properties
plus
these
vast
natural
resources,
some
of
which
are
not
currently
producing
income,
but
are
expected
to
in
the
future.
now,
there's
no
issue
in
this
question
about
the
valuation
of
railroad
properties.
committee
agrees
that
it's
proper
to
take
a
capitalization
of
earnings
because
they
are
not
readily
marketable
and
they
are
worth
only
what
they
can
earn.
committee
was
satisfied
with
the
60-40
gnnp
relationship
on
the
railroad
properties.
mr.
williams,
the
committee's
expert
came
up
with
the
price
earnings
ratio
of
15
times
earnings
in
1960
when
the
terms
were
agreed
upon
as
an
appropriate
one
and
that
hasn't
been
questioned
anywhere
in
the
record.
the
real
issue
is
how
are
you
going
to
value
these
natural
resources?
the
applicant's
position
on
that
on
the
record
was
that
it's
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
to
value
respective
stocks
except
on
the
basis
of
capitalization
of
earnings.
that
they
made
an
attempt
to
value
stocks
by
a
separate
valuation
and
they
found
it
impractical.
why?
because
they
couldn't
agree
on
the
stock
ratio
because
of
difficulty
of
valuing
these
properties
on
account
of
market
conditions
and
the
uncertainty
of
their
future
potential.
so
they
made
what
they
called
no
definitive
valuation
of
properties.
they
say
it
in
the
last
analysis,
it
just
has
to
be
a
question
of
judgment.
now,
the
committee's
position
was
and
is
that
you
arrive
at
a
proper,
the
intrinsic
stock
market
value
of
these
two
stocks
which
is
what
schwabacher
mandated
that
it's
more
appropriate
to
take
a
market
value
of
them
rather
than
measure
them
on
the
basis
of
capitalization
of
earnings.
but
if
you
do
take
current
earnings
and
capitalize
it,
that
in
the
market
place,
knowledgeable
traders
wind
up
with
a
very
high
price
earnings
ratio.
northern
pacific's
financial
adviser
agrees
with
the
committee.
let
me
read
to
you
from
exhibit
32,
page
3
which
is
morgan
stanley's
report
on
the
non-railroad
properties.
here's
what
they
say.
“in
essence,
however,
a
sale
of
interest
in
the
properties
would
take
place
to
create
northern
stockholders
and
on
this
basis,
northern
pacific
stockholders
should
realize
sale
value
rather
than
value
based
on
capitalization
of
earnings.”
and
the
committee
chairman
frankly
testified
on
his
direct
testimony
that
you
can't
make
any
exact
appraisal
in
dollars
of
these
properties.
we
claim
however
though,
although
it's
not
easy
to
value,
some
approximate
valuation
is
not
only
possible,
but
is
necessary
if
you're
going
to
sustain
merger
terms.
now,
what
was
the
applicant's
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
this
finding?
it's
based
largely
on
past
performances
to
earnings,
dividends,
stock
market
quotations
and
pro
forma,
dividend
comparisons
and
on
an
erroneous
and
gloomy
prediction
that
there
was
nothing
reasonably
foreseeable
to
indicate
that
northern
pacific's
future
earnings
prospects
were
better
than
great
northern's.
and
i'm
sure
the
court
is
aware,
my
former
statement,
in
the
last
two
years,
our
earnings
have
exceeded
great
northern's.
now,
the
gn's
financial
adviser,
first
boston's
witness
testified,
“the
study
of
past
performance
is
only
important
insofar
as
it
measures
or
predicts
future
prospects.”
this
was
his
direct
testimony.
with
that,
the
committee
agreed.
now,
the
applicant's
case
as
to
the
future
prospects
and
value
of
these
resources
is
based
on
evidence
that
we
regard
as
of
little
prohibitive
value
and
that's
the
test
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
they
offered
no
market
appraisals
for
these
properties.
they
put
on
the
stand,
no
timber,
oil
or
other
geologist
or
expert
on
these
matters
that
we
could
cross-examine,
there's
none
of
that.
both
financial
advisers
on
cross-examination
were
extremely
vague
as
to
past
prices
of
timber
and
oil.
in
other
words,
a
direct
case
of
the
applicants
was
largely
a
long
dreary
account
of
their
negotiation,
how
they
couldn't
agree
and
all
the
arguments
that
they
had
and
it
was
argument
that
largely
not
hard,
positive
reliable
evidence.
now,
contrast
the
committee's
case.
we
were
very
serious
in
this
proceeding.
we
were
observing
the
injunction
in
the
erie
case.
it
said
dissenting
stockholders
should
put
in
positive
evidence
and
should
state
precise
inequities.
we
had
this
constantly
in
mind.
so
that
when
we
put
in
our
direct
case,
we
had
three
experts
on
stock
evaluation
analysis
and
an
oil
geologist
that
were
subjected
to
searching
cross-examinations.
they
testified
as
to
various
factors
that
must
be
considered
when
you
get
to
valuing
what
the
traders
will
--
how
they
will
trade
these
natural
resources
and
properties
in
the
public
market?
mr.
brundage,
chairman
of
the
committee
testified
as
to
the
strong
earning
power
of
the
natural
resources,
improved
geological
and
geophysical
discovery
techniques,
the
freedom
of
these
properties
from
obsolescence
contrary
to
railroad
properties,
the
low
financial
risk,
the
very
high
return
on
capital
investment.
our
natural
resources
are
yielding
each
year
more
than
100%
of
the
return.
whereas
the
testimony
of
the
applicants
on
their
direct
case
was
that
northern
pacific
in
1960
gets
--
getting
a
return
of
1.4%
on
its
transportation
properties.
he
spoke
of
the
tax
savings
running
into
millions
of
dollars
occasioned
by
the
depletion
allowances.
he
spoke
of
the
control
elements
that
you
didn't
have
to
develop
properties
in
a
hurry.
you
could
take
your
time
and
you're
in
control
of
it
and
most
importantly,
he
spoke
of
the
intrinsic
and
the
survival
values
of
these
properties
in
an
inflationary
period.
now
mr.
williams
reported
on
his
studies
of
comparative
companies
that
had
similar
properties,
then
he
wound
up
with
a
price
earnings
ratio
in
his
judgment
was
50
times
earnings
and
this
was
never
been
questioned
by
any
testimony
on
the
part
of
the
applicants.
he
pointed
to
the
txl,
texaco
deal
which
happen
to
be
consummated
about
that
time.
it
was
a
merger
like
ours,
in
which
the
price
earnings
ratio
were
75
times
earnings.
now,
in
the
morgan
stanley
report
which
you
can
see
in
exhibit
32,
morgan
stanley,
in
making
their
recommendations
were
terms
favorable
to
northern
pacific
against
gn
came
up
with
price
earnings
ratio
of
12
on
oil
and
gas,
15
on
timber
and
15
on
other
minerals.
our
oil
geologist
that
was
particularly
familiar
with
the
williston
banking,
based
and
he'd
cut
his
eye
teeth
up
in
that
area,
testified
as
to
the
favorable
prospects
of
the
williston
basin.
he
predicted
a
billion
tons
of
oil
out
of
the
basin
in
the
next
decade.
he
spoke
of
a
use
of
the
exploration
there.
the
lack
of
the
exploration
of
the
deeper
layers
of
the
ground
that
pointed
out
that
in
the
williston
basin,
they'd
get
a
higher
rate
of
discovery
than
the
national
rate.
and
he
also
said
that
additional
income
from
the
oil
would
come
from
secondary
recoveries.
now,
mr.
story
testified
as
to
the
economic
matters
and
particularly
as
to
trends
of
prices
of
natural
resources
and
their
value
as
a
hedge
against
probable
future
monetary
inflation.
now,
the
important
thing
for
this
court
to
realize
is
that
this
body
of
specific
testimony
on
the
part
of
the
committee
was
never
rebutted.
they
had
--
the
applicants
had
morgan
stanley,
they
had
all
the
oil
experts
and
timber
experts
on
the
payroll.
thousands
of
our
stockholders'
money
was
paid
to
hire
them,
but
they
didn't
go
on
the
stand
and
say
that
mr.
william's
price
earnings
ratio
was
wrong
or
that
mr.
brundage's
testimony
as
to
the
various
factors
that
must
be
considered
in
the
marketplace
relating
to
our
natural
resources
were
improper
or
to
how
to
weigh
any
factors
that
pertain
to
these
natural
resources,
you
just
draw
a
blank
from
the
applicants
on
that
aspect.
so,
we
say
that
their
testimony
is
not
proven.
it
isn't
reliable.
no
experts,
nobody
to
get
at
the
truth.
now,
the
committee
doesn't
claim
that
exchange
ratios
can
be
based
on
exact
dollar
evaluations,
but
it
does
claim
that
there
must
be
some
rational
basis
in
the
record
for
any
alleged
just
ratio.
if
the
commission
is
to
discharge
its
duty
and
this
court
is
to
have
any
meaningful
review
of
the
record,
and
that
just
that
you
will
search
this
record
and
you
will
not
find
how
they
arrived
at
these
decisions
except
through
these
bargaining
process.
now,
the
committee
also
developed
calculations
to
show
they
were
precise
in
their
criticisms
of
these
terms.
they're
all
set
forth
on
three
different
theories
and
four
different
points
of
time,
there
were
12
different
computations
and
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
they
all
with
one
exception,
show
that
great
northern
should
be
preferred.
it's
all
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
and
i'm
sure
and
i
hope
you
will
study
it.
now,
this
record
contains
no
discussion
by
either
the
commission
or
the
district
court
of
this
expensive
testimony
of
the
committee.
or
was
any
rational
explanation
given,
set
forth
anywhere
as
to
how
the
particular
ratios
were
developed
or
could
be
justified.
we
urge
that
the
wholly
conclusionary
finding
of
the
commission
that
these
mergers
fairly
reflect
the
contributions
of
the
group
of
stockholders
involved
is
not
supported
by
reliable,
probative
and
substantial
evidence
as
the
administrator
procedure
requires.
now,
i
received
a
five-minute
warning
here.
our
third
claim
which
is
that
the
commission
grossly
erred
in
views
of
the
discretion,
denied
us
due
process
and
outlying
a
lot
of
evidence
of
new
evidence
that's
available
now
that
wasn't
then.
the
pierce
case
has
been
cited
here
as
it
--
by
the
district
court
as
support,
but
the
pierce
case
was
one
in
which
they
were
dealing
with
the
impact
of
war
inflation.
and
they
said
that
as
to
that
matter,
the
commission
was
--
that's
right
within
the
scope
of
their
particularized
expertise
and
that
therefore,
there
was
no
need
to
interrupt
them.
we've
--
we
concede
that
the
general
view
is
that
you
shouldn't
interfere
with
this,
but
the
adjacent
case
was
right
on
all
fours
with
us.
there
they
were
dealing
with
the
depression,
now
we're
dealing
with
inflation.
even
the
president
in
his
radio
speech
last
friday
drew
this
comparison.
so,
we
say
in
conclusion
that
on
no
basis
and
on
no
theory
does
the
record
sustain
the
finding
below
and
that
they
made
a
serious
error
when
they
took
the
wrong
test
and
applied
the
bargaining
process
and
the
stockholder's
vote
as
determined.
the
commission
simply
didn't
do
its
homework
on
this
case.
you're
going
to
find
difficulty,
i
think,
in
finding
in
this
record
any
rational
basis
to
sustain
what
has
been
found.
so,
in
conclusion,
i
would
like,
respectfully
ask
this
court
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
be
reversed
and
that
the
course
be
remanded
to
it
with
instructions
that
the
matter
be
remanded
that
the
commission
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
the
opinion
of
this
court.
now,
as
was
set
by
this
court
in
the
penn-central
case,
the
short
delay
occasioned
by
a
remand
is
not
too
high
a
price
to
pay
to
assure
a
disposition
of
this
matter
that
is
just
to
all
parties.
i
thank
you
for
earnest
consideration.
mr.
louis
b.
dailey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
oral
argument
before
this
court,
the
proponents
of
the
merger
have
chosen
not
to
meet
the
committee’s
argument.
the
livingston
anti-merger
committee’s
argument
on
the
merits
and
have
chosen
to
rely
on
their
brief.
it
is
suggested
here
that
the
tide
of
difficult
arguments
of
economic
imponderables
largely
attached
to
the
antitrust
issue
not
be
allowed
to
sweep
away
the
arguments
of
the
livingston
anti-merger
committee.
in
closing
therefore,
it
would
seem
appropriate
to
note
once
more
that
the
livingston
anti-merger
committee
raises
the
threshold
that
issues
in
these
consolidated
cases.
if
the
court
finds
in
favor
of
the
livingston
anti-merger
committee
on
either
of
the
two
threshold
issues
which
it
had
raised,
the
arguments
of
economic
imponderables
become
moot.
in
summary,
the
livingston
anti-merger
committee
claims
that
ownership
of
the
federally
chartered
right
of
away
is
a
jurisdictional
element.
if
it
is
not
owned,
the
right
of
way
is
not
owned
by
a
merger
applicant
or
party
petitioning
for
inclusion
in
the
merger
and
the
committee
claims
that
isn’t,
the
commission
has
no
jurisdiction.
and
secondly,
even
assuming
the
commission
has
jurisdiction
over
the
proposed
merger
had
accept
in
railways
claim
of
title
to
the
federal
chartered
right
of
away.
the
merger
is
still
barred
by
statutory
law
in
contract.
it
is
barred
by
the
provisions
of
the
federal
charter
which
were
imposed
upon
the
road
when
congress
granted
the
road
in
the
first
place.
and
those
two
provisions,
there
are
two
provisions.
one
prohibits
some
merger
and
the
other
prohibits
mortgage
without
congressional
consent.
if
railways
succeeded
to
the
title
the
main
line
right
of
away
federally
chartered
to
railroad
then
a
railway
also
succeeded
to
the
liabilities
and
obligations
and
burdens
which
that
title
carry.
and
two
of
those
burdens,
is
no
merger
and
no
mortgage
without
congressional
consent.
icc
has
no
position
to
override
these
impositions.
these
are
impositions
that
have
been
placed
by
congress
in
the
federal
charter
which
congress
preempted.
i
see
my
time
is
up
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
