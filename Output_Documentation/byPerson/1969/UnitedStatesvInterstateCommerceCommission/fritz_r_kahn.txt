mr.

may
it
please
the
court.
counsels
for
the
appellees
on
these
consolidated
cases
have
agreed
upon
a
division
of
their
argument.
i
shall
deal
principally
in
--
with
the
illegal
standards
observed
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
approving
the
merger
of
the
northern
lines
responding
to
the
several
contestants
of
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
cox,
a
counsel
for
the
railroads,
will
deal
with
the
several
factual
factors
and
that
went
into
the
decision
to
merge
these
roads,
including
the
many
benefits
to
the
shipping
public
and
that
it
enrolled
offered.
he
additionally
will
respond
to
the
contentions
of
the
northern
pacific
committee.
he
will
be
followed
by
mr.
fred
tolan
on
behalf
of
230
pacific
northwest
shippers
who
will
deal
with
the
merger
principally
from
the
standpoint
of
the
patrons
of
these
roads.
and
finally,
mr.
merrill
and
counsel
for
the
milwaukee
will
treat
specifically
with
the
conditions
attached
by
the
commissions
for
the
protection
of
that
road.
the
public
utility
commissioner
of
oregon
who
had
initially
opposed
the
merger
before
the
commission
now
supports
it.
he,
however,
relies
on
his
brief
and
will
not
separately
argue.
ten
years
ago,
a
committee
of
the
congress
criticized
the
nation's
railroads.
in
a
report
it
said,
the
railroad
industry
has
not
been
sufficiently
interested
in
self-help
in
such
matters
as
consolidations
and
mergers.
and
last
year,
and
this
court
noted
in
the
penn-central
cases
that
the
intervening
years
have
marked
a
tremendous
change
and
that
the
railroads
now
embarked
upon
a
vast
reorganization
of
rail
transportation
implementing
the
congressional
policy
of
encouraging
consolidation
of
the
nation's
railroads
into
a
limited
number
of
systems.
department
of
justice
has
opposed
that
realignment.
at
one
stage
or
another,
the
department
has
opposed
every
major
railroad
consolidation
of
the
past
decade.
its
present
attack
--
the
challenges
of
the
very
premise
upon
which
the
commission
cater
for
has
authorized
and
approved
railroad
mergers
and
the
rationale
upon
which
the
courts
on
review
have
sustained
them.
essentially,
the
question
is
this.
may
a
consolidation
of
railroads
be
held
to
be
in
the
public
interest
upon
the
commission's
finding
of
improved
transportation,
efficiencies
and
economies
that
the
transport
action
itself
will
yield
when
weighed
against
the
facts
of
evidence
at
the
competitive
consequences.
the
commission
and
the
courts
have
said
yes.
the
department
has
unsuccessfully
maintained
in
the
past,
says
no.
its
position
is
that
acknowledged
savings,
operational
improvements
and
service
benefits
flowing
from
the
affiliation
of
railroads
without
more
cannot
serve
and
to
offset
the
loss
of
competition.
the
commission
found
and
a
unanimous
lower
court
agreed,
from
that,
the
merger
would
produce
savings
of
$40
million
annually.
the
commission
found
and
the
lower
court
agreed
that
would
result
in
better
service.
department
does
not
now
seriously
challenge
the
findings
of
savings.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
in
the
second
report
and
your
honor,
the
commission
found
annual
savings
of
$40
million.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
in
the
first
report,
they
estimated
the
savings
to
be
between
12.7
and
25.5
million.
at
the
further
hearing,
evidence
was
introduced
showing
that
the
savings
would
be
substantially
greater.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes
sir.
department
maintains
that
this
merger
cannot
proceed.
it
likens
the
railroad
and
to
the
players
in
the
game
as
reply
brief
says,
four
is
better
than
three,
three
better
than
two
and
two
better
than
one,
but
such
have
not
been
the
rules
of
the
game
for
nearly
half
a
century.
the
transportation
act
of
1920
established
altogether
different
standards,
marking
a
fundamental
change
in
the
scheme
of
railroad
regulation.
by
that
legislation,
the
commission
for
the
first
time
was
empowered
to
authorize
the
improve
--
and
to
authorize
and
approve
now
the
merger
of
railroads
not
withstanding
their
anti-competitive
effects.
indeed,
and
that
legislation
specifically
conferred
anti-trust
immunity
upon
transactions
approved
by
the
commission.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
now,
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
and
that
is
correct
sir
and
before
that
time,
the
mergers
were
governed
solely
by
the
sherman
and
the
clayton
acts
and
it
was
during
this
period
that
this
court
decided
in
northern
security's
case
and
the
southern
pacific
case
consolidation.
now,
following
the
1920
enactment,
two
acquisitions
of
control
have
reached
this
court.
and
i
specifically
invite
this
court's
attention
to
its
decisions
in
the
new
york
central
securities
case
and
the
texas
case.
now,
the
most
dramatic
example
under
the
transportation
act
of
1920
that
the
commission
could
authorize
from
one
railroad's
acquisition
of
control
of
another,
even
in
the
face
of
the
most
serious
anti-competitive
consequences
was
afforded
by
the
southern
pacific
case.
in
1922,
this
court
had
found
that
the
control
of
the
central
pacific
by
the
southern
pacific
violated
the
sherman
act
and
it
ordered
the
divestiture.
southern
pacific,
however,
in
an
effort
to
maintain
control
applied
to
the
commission
for
authorization
under
the
provisions
of
the
transportation
act
of
1920
enacted
subsequently
to
the
beginning
of
the
anti-trust
prosecution.
the
commission
in
its
report
found
that
separation
of
the
lines
would
result
in
more
expensive
and
less
efficient
and
satisfactory
service
that
can
be
rendered
under
unified
control.
it
approved
the
control
of
relationship
and
thereby
validated
the
very
relationship
that
this
court
had
found
to
be
unlawful
the
proceeding
year.
then
none
of
the
cases,
and
decided
by
the
commission
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
utah
have
found
and
that
the
mandate
of
this
court
in
essence
was
satisfied
in
that
no
divestiture
was
required,
the
commission
having
found
the
control
relationship
to
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
it
was
not
reviewed
on
the
merits,
your
honor.
now,
none
of
these
cases
decided
by
the
commission,
some
of
which
were
sustained
by
the
courts
and
it
was
the
commission's
operate
--
authorization
premised
upon
findings
such
as
the
department
now
would
insist
upon.
in
the
face
of
their
evident
anti-competitive
effects
and
the
proposals
were
approved
by
the
commission
upon
commission's
findings
of
improved
transportation,
the
economy's
inefficiencies
that
the
trans-action
itself
would
yield.
the
department
discusses
none
of
these
cases.
it
ignores
altogether
and
to
the
important
cases
of
the
1920
to
1940
formative
period.
by
1940,
it
had
become
apparent
that
the
ambitious
nationwide
plan
of
consolidation
which
was
a
part
of
the
1920
act
was
not
bearing
fruit.
the
transportation
act
of
1940
relieved
the
commission
of
having
to
formulate
the
plan
as
that
it
permits
the
commission
to
approve
carry
their
initiated
voluntary
plans
if
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
and
so
the
40
act
permitted
the
commission
to
approve
acquisitions
--
approve
merges
of
railroads
as
it
previously
had
acquisitions
of
control
subject
only
to
the
standard
of
consistency
with
the
public
interest.
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
the
congressional
purpose
in
this
1940
act
was
to
facilitate
merger
and
consolidation
in
the
national
transportation
system.
the
result
of
the
act
and
it
was
a
change
in
the
means
while
the
end
remained
the
same.
we
do
not
view
svenska
amerika
as
changing
that
and
we
do
not
think
svenska
amerika
--
and
america
can
be
silent
or
in
overruling
decades
of
administrative
and
judicial
construction.
secondly,
and
most
significant,
in
that
proceeding
and
there
were
no
benefits
from
the
transaction
from
the
agreements
offered
for
federal
maritime
commission
approval
and
the
federal
maritime
commission
specifically
so
found.
but
finally,
there
is
no
suggestion
in
svenska
amerika
that
the
kinds
of
improvements,
service
benefits
found
to
flow
from
the
transaction
here
approved
by
the
commission
would
not
satisfy
the
requirement
of
svenska
amerika.
beginning
with
the
decision
in
the
mclean
case
which
incidentally
involved
a
merger
of
seven
motor
carriers
into
the
largest
single
motor
carrier
in
the
united
states.
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
under
the
1940
act
as
under
the
1920
act,
the
achieving
of
an
adequate,
efficient
and
economical
system
of
transportation
was
a
matter
of
paramount
national
concern.
and
the
preservation
of
competition
among
carriers,
although
still
of
value
is
significant
chiefly
as
it
aids
in
the
attainment
of
the
objective
of
the
national
transportation
system.
indeed,
we
show
in
our
brief,
that
some
of
the
very
arguments
in
which
the
department
now
makes
were
considered
and
rejected
by
the
court
in
the
mclean
case.
this
court's
affirmance
in
1967
of
the
seaboard
summary
affirmance
--
in
1967
of
the
seaboard
coastline
merger
under
the
standards
of
the
1940
act
was
one
of
several
occurrences
in
following
the
commission's
first
report
in
the
northern
lines
case
and
contributing
to
its
change
of
mind
in
the
approval
of
the
northern
lines'
merger
in
the
second
report.
in
many
of
the
characteristics
in
the
seaboard
coastline
merger
were
similar
to
that
of
the
northern
lines.
though
from
the
standpoint
of
the
anti-competitive
consequences
flowing
from
the
transaction
and
we
submit
and
that
the
present
merger
poses
even
more,
even
fewer
problems,
less
onerous
and
then
the
early
one
the
early
one,
the
seaboard
coastline.
therein
here,
the
merger
involved
two
relatively
healthy,
parallel
rail
competitors,
dominant
in
expensing
an
economically
significant
section
of
the
country.
although
the
net
earnings
of
seaboard
coastline
and
were
found
by
the
commission
to
be
better
than
they
are
in
the
northern
lines.
there
is
here,
the
merging
railroads
were
each
other's
principal
competitors,
though
again,
the
volume
of
traffic
for
which
they
competed,
was
greater
for
the
seaboard
and
coastline
than
it
is
for
the
northern
lines.
they
in
here
and
the
merger
of
the
railroads
and
denied
some
communities
of
competitive
rail
service.
although
cities
of
the
size
of
tampa,
and
areas
as
extensive
as
central
and
western
florida
served
only
by
the
merged
seaboard
coastline,
are
totally
without
counterpart
in
the
northern
lines
merger.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
only
partially
and
your
honor
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
i
shall.
the
--
commissioner
webb
had
dissented
in
the
seaboard
coastline
case
and
of
course,
he
was
the
author
of
the
commission's
first
report.
and
some
of
his
thinking
as
to
the
--
of
the
–
and
the
necessity
for
preserving
railroad
competition
and
certainly
his
view
in
the
transportation
act
of
1920
of
facilitating
railroad
mergers,
but
this
doctrine
was
not
carried
forward
into
the
1940
act
and
was
evident
in
the
one
as
in
the
other.
and
there
is
certain
amount
of
confusion
as
to
what
the
1940
act
did
and
was
a
factor
in
which
contributed
to
the
second
report.
there's
only
one
of
several.
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
seaboard
coastline
case
and
the
department
as
it
does
here
opposed
the
transaction
and
as
it
does
here,
it
said,
and
without
overriding
public
benefits,
the
transaction
could
not
be
approved.
indeed,
in
the
lower
court
in
its
opinion,
paraphrased
the
position
of
the
department
and
said
and
the
government's
position
really
was
that
where
two
healthy
competitors
are
involved,
economies
or
dollar
savings
and
other
alleged
benefits
should
never
be
enough
and
to
overcome
severe
elimination
of
competition
such
as
here
involved.
of
course,
the
lower
court
rejected
the
department's
argument
and
this
court
summarily
affirmed.
turning
to
other
considerations
which
occurred
between
the
first
and
the
second
report,
the
first
of
these
is
the
accommodation
of
the
employees
of
the
railroads.
in
the
first
report,
the
commission
had
found
some
5200
jobs
on
the
applicant
railroads
that
would
be
eliminated
and
that
the
adverse
effect
due
to
bumping
would
be
even
more
severe.
there's
no
question
that
the
commission
cast
this
into
the
balance
in
favor
the
northern.
now
following
the
first
report,
of
course,
the
railroads
reached
agreements
and
with
the
couple
of
the
unions
providing
for
protection
of
their
members
against
job
losses
except
and
by
attrition.
in
approving
the
merger
in
the
second
report
the
commission
imposed
such
protective
conditions
for
all
employees,
including
those
not
covered
by
the
negotiated
agreements.
another
change
of
course,
was
the
protection
afforded
the
competing
railroads.
excuse
me.
milwaukee
and
northwestern
had
opposed
in
the
merger
unless
certain
conditions
were
attached.
in
turn,
northern
lines
opposed
attachment
of
such
conditions
and
this
led
to
the
commission
to
conclude
in
its
first
report
that
attaching
these
conditions
indeed
might
include,
might
preclude
consummation.
now,
following
the
first
report,
agreements
were
reached
with
the
railroads
and
all
of
the
sought
after
conditions
were
attached.
i
shall
not
discuss
these
conditions
in
detail
and
mr.
merrill
for
milwaukee
shall.
i
simply
wish
to
point
out
that
as
a
result
of
these
conditions,
the
milwaukee
for
the
first
time,
and
we'll
be
able
to
reach
portland,
for
the
first
time,
will
be
able
to
render
service
at
billing
and
incidentally,
this
was
a
new
condition
in
the
second
report,
it
was
not
considered
for
attachment
in
the
first
report.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes
sir.
thirdly,
the
milwaukee,
for
the
first
time
will
be
able
to
participate
in
west
coast
traffic
to
and
from
bridge
columbia
and
for
the
first
time,
the
milwaukee
will
be
able
to
solicit
northern
tier
transcontinental
traffic
originating
at
or
destined
to
points
not
on
its
line
by
being
able
to
interchange
such
traffic
at
competitive
rates
at
11
points
certain
in
timing
with
the
northern
lines.
and
as
the
commission
found,
this
afforded
to
the
shipper
a
slower
club
to
short
haul
in
the
merge
system
in
the
event
that
he
is
not
satisfied
with
the
treatment
he's
getting.
in
its
third
supplemental
report,
the
commission
specifically
opened
these
11
gateways
into
the
transportation
of
grain
destined
for
the
primary
markets
i
minneapolis,
st.
paul
and
sioux
city.
at
these
conditions,
will
make
up
the
milwaukee
a
new
railroad
can
scarcely
be
questioned.
as
i
pointed
out
at
the
outset,
they
were
considered
of
sufficient
consequence
that
the
public
utility
commission
of
oregon
would
oppose
the
merger
before
the
commission
following
the
imposition
of
the
conditions
supported
the
merger.
and
more
importantly,
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
charged
under
the
statute
with
representing
the
agricultural
community
considered
them
to
be
a
benefit
to
the
public
in
general
and
to
the
agricultural
community
in
particular.
and
accordingly
before
the
commission,
he
too
changed
his
position
and
following
imposition
of
the
condition
withdrew
his
opposition
to
the
merger.
lastly,
among
the
conditions
to
obtain
between
the
first
and
second
report,
was
the
receipt
of
additional
evidence
as
to
the
savings.
in
the
first
report,
as
i
indicated
before
in
response
and
to
the
question
to
mr.
justice
harlan
the
commission
had
found,
i
believe
it
was,
the
commission
had
found
that
the
savings
might
be
$25.5
million.
however,
without
explanation
and
bringing
this
figure
down
to
its
conclusion,
the
commission
found
that
the
savings
might
only
reach
$12.7
million.
and
it
was
this
figure,
the
range
of
$12.7
million
to
$25.5
million
annually
a
guess
at
which
the
commission
measured
the
anti-competitive
consequences.
following
the
receipt
of
additional
evidence,
the
analysis
of
additional
studies
and
the
commission
concluded
that
the
annual
savings
would
approach
$40
million
and
the
lower
court
agreed.
in
reaching
this
conclusion,
i
might
point
out
that
the
commission
did
indeed
consider
the
possibility
and
that
certain
savings,
certain
improvements
might
be
achieved
short
of
merger
by
the
coordination
of
facilities.
at
best,
these
would
have
yielded
as
the
commission
found
at
300
of
the
record,
as
the
commission
mentioned
that
300
of
the
record
a
$5.2
million,
but
the
commission
went
on
to
state
specifically
many
of
the
coordinations
though
physically
feasible
will
produce
grossly
unequal
benefits
to
great
northern,
northern
pacific
a
separate
carriers.
further,
in
a
competition
between
the
northern
lines,
it
renders
it
difficult
if
not
impossible
as
a
practical
matter
to
incur
the
expense
involved
in
effecting
such
coordination.
it
is
against
these
benefits
then
that
the
lessening
of
competition
the
commission
said
must
be
weighed.
and
that
there
will
be
a
very
substantial
lessening
of
competition
has
never
been
questioned.
the
commission
referred
to
this
as
an
undisputed
fact.
and
as
--
indeed
as
i
believe
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
this
morning,
it's
scarcely
possible
to
conceive
of
a
significant
merger
of
railroads
in
an
area
that
would
not
be
anti-competitive.
but
that
is
not
to
say
that
these
anti-competitive
consequences
can
be
ignored
by
the
commission.
and
the
commission
very
carefully
referring
to
this
court's
decision
in
mcclain,
in
minneapolis,
in
seaboard
coastline
said
that
it
has
a
duty
to
estimate
the
scope
and
appraise
the
effects
of
the
curtailment
of
competition
which
will
result
from
the
proposed
consolidation
and
consider
them
along
with
the
advantages
of
improved
service,
safer
operations,
lower
cost,
etcetera
to
determine
whether
the
consolidation
will
assist
in
effectuating
overall
transportation
policy.
this
we
submit,
the
commission
has
done.
the
commission
noted
that
great
northern
and
northern
pacific
are
competitive
and
that
their
lines
extend
generally
through
the
same
northern
tier
states
and
from
seattle
and
portland
on
the
west,
to
duluth
superior,
minneapolis,
saint
paul
on
the
east,
but
they
are
also
complementary
and
that
the
great
northern's
principle
mileage
is
in
the
east
and
northern
pacific's
in
the
west.
and
while
their
lines
are
parallel
and
great
northern
primarily
serves
northern
communities
in
the
northern
tier
states,
and
while
the
northern
pacific
serves
those
towards
the
south.
and
at
many
points
as
the
commission
pointed
out
as
between
helena
and
shelby,
montana
the
main
lines
of
these
railroads
are
several
--
are
better
than
a
hundred
miles
apart.
and
the
commission
pointed
out
that
obviously
a
shipper
located
on
or
near
in
the
line
on
one
road,
and
but
50
or
100
miles
from
the
line
of
another
is
not
influenced
by
the
competition
in
the
selection
of
the
carriers.
in
our
brief,
we
offer
many
examples.
we
quote
for
example
a
montana
grain
dealer
who
has
elevators
near
the
northern
pacific
tracks,
and
he
said,
“for
the
most
part,
the
grain
has
to
move
on
the
railroad
pretty
close
to
where
it's
grown.
for
instance
i
can't
ship
on
the
milwaukee
if
it
even
if
their
rate
is
zero.
”the
commission
in
the
second
report
indeed
recognized
and
that
the
northern
tier
states
are
rich
in
animal,
mineral,
agricultural
and
forest
resources.
it
recognized
full
well
that
this
cost,
this
traffic
constitutes
as
mr.
mclaren
pointed
out,
approximately
60%
of
the
traffic
originated
by
these
roads
in
this
area.
as
--
it
is
for
this
very
traffic
that
rail
transportation
offers
the
most
and
distinct
competitive
advantage
to
use
as
phrase,
were
the
greatest
inherent
advantages.
but
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
with
respect
to
this
very
traffic,
80%
comes
from
points
that
are
none
competitive
between
the
merging
railroads.
the
department
at
no
time
has
challenged
these
figures,
neither
has
the
department
ever
challenged
the
fact
and
the
truck
competition
has
become
very
pervasive
at
least
as
to
one
category
of
products,
manufacture
and
miscellaneous
products.
it
was
with
respect
to
this
category
of
traffic
and
that
the
commission
specifically
found
in
the
second
report
that
these
railroads
are
most
vulnerable
to
motor
carrier
competition.
it
found
moreover
that
it
is
this
traffic
that
the
rail
carriers
must
retain
to
balance
their
operations
in
handling
the
products
of
the
agricultural
and
extracted
industries.
the
record
establishes
and
the
commission
so
found
that
this
category
of
traffic
manufactured
in
miscellaneous
products
constitutes
more
than
30%
of
the
great
northern's
carload
revenue
and
nearly
40%
of
the
northern
pacific,
and
for
both
road
its
the
single
most
important
category
of
traffic.
now
with
respect
to
the
much
quoted
in
exhibit
16
referred
to
in
the
commission's
report,
second
report
in
the
vicinity
of
page
316
of
the
record.
the
commission
acknowledged
full
well
and
its
second
report
as
it
had
in
its
first
that
rail
competition
will
be
eliminated
entirely
at
47
communities
in
the
northern
tier.
however,
the
commission
went
on
and
to
point
that
the
number
of
stations
is
small,
being
less
than
5%
of
the
stations
in
those
very
states,
and
it
went
on
to
point
out
that
these
stations
produced
an
insubstantial
volume
of
applicant's
business,
approximately
6%
whether
measured
by
cars
or
revenue.
additionally,
the
commission
found
with
these
so
called
class
--
with
respect
to
these
so
called
class
one
points
that
some
of
them
are
located
on
the
main
line
of
one
applicant
and
on
the
branch
line
of
another
and
with
the
result
that
the
loss
of
competition
is
more
theoretical
than
real.
helena,
montana
is
a
perfectly
good
example,
it
being
on
the
main
line
of
the
northern
pacific,
but
on
the
branch
line
of
the
great
northern.
with
respect
to
the
class
two
stations,
those
served
by
two
or
more
of
the
applicant
railroads
and
at
least
one
other
railroad,
the
commission
acknowledged
in
its
second
report
as
it
had
in
the
first
that
rail
competition
will
be
diminished,
but
not
eliminate
it
at
these
160
stations.
it
recognized
in
the
second
report
as
it
had
in
the
first
that
these
stations
contribute
about
33%
of
the
cars
and
38%
of
the
revenue
of
the
northern
lines
in
this
area.
mr.
mclaren
would
add
all
these
figures
including
overhead
traffic
and
tell
you
that
the
railroad's
merger
would
result
in
a
loss
of
competition
of
55%.
mr.
mclaren
forgets
however,
that
the
addition
of
the
bridge
traffic
it
increases
its
universe
and
as
the
examiner
found
at
page
770
of
the
record,
771,
if
bridge
traffic
were
included
that
percentage
of
the
total
traffic
handled
in
1960
at
the
stations
where
there
will
be
a
reduction
in
the
number
of
rail
carriers
would
be
smaller
than
the
figures
subsequently
shown.
we
point
out
that
at
nearly
two
thirds
of
these
class
two
stations
served
by
two
of
the
applicants
and
one
other
road,
with
respect
to
these,
we
point
out
that
97
and
out
of
the
160
stations,
nearly
two
thirds
all
occur
at
four
places;
seattle,
spokane,
minneapolis,
saint
paul,
duluth,
superior.
and
it
is
with
respect
to
these
points
that
the
commission
in
its
second
report
specifically
found
that
following
the
merger,
none
would
be
served
by
fewer
than
three
railroads
nor
fewer
than
15
truck
lines.
the
commission
in
its
second
report
pointed
out
that
even
though
some
of
the
points
show
up
as
class
two
stations
reflecting
service
by
two
or
more
of
the
applicant
railroads
and
at
least
one
other,
they
do
not
have
competition
between
the
applicants
today.
for
example,
the
largest
community
in
the
northern
tier
which
would
be
left
without
competitive
rail
service
as
a
result
of
the
merger
is
pasco,
washington.
at
pasco,
washington
the
northern
pacific
comes
in
from
one
direction,
and
the
sp&s
goes
out
in
another
direction
and
the
competition
between
them
is
really
nonexistent.
as
to
all
of
the
points,
all
of
the
class
two
points,
the
commission
found
first
apportionment
of
traffic
between
great
northern
and
northern
pacific
and
the
other
road
serving
these
points
is
not
wholly
the
result
of
interplay
of
competitive
forces,
but
often
results
from
other
factors
entirely.
second,
the
shippers
at
these
class
two
locations
in
addition
to
the
northern
lines
and
one
other
rail
carrier,
are
generally
served
by
other
modes
of
transportation
vigorously
competing
for
traffic.
and
third,
by
virtue
of
the
conditions
imposed
in
this
case,
the
milwaukee
which
is
the
other
railroad
serving
many
of
the
class
two
points
will
be
substantially
strengthened
as
a
meaningful
transcontinental
competitor.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
i
believe
the
argument
has
been
held
before
the
commission
and
the
report
of
the
commission
is
being
awaited.
beginning
at
page
48
of
our
brief,
we
offer
examples
drawn
from
the
record
which
fully
support
he
commission's
findings.
we
show
how
some
shippers
and
this
is
particularly
true
of
the
large
national
accounts,
simply
allocate
traffic
as
between
available
rail
carriers.
we
show
the
number,
the
growth
and
the
activity
of
truck
lines
at
the
class
two
points.
at
fargo
for
example,
20
motor
carriers
compete
for
traffic
with
the
railroad
and
the
record
establishes
in
that
50%
of
the
less
than
car
load
merchandise
traffic
received
there
arrives
by
truck.
and
we
point
out
that
the
commission
found
that
the
milwaukee
has
shorter
routes
and
superior
rate
and
will
offer
competitive
service
right
through
the
heart
of
the
northern
tier
serving
most
of
the
class
two
stations.
moreover,
the
commission
in
its
second
report
accorded
much
weight
to
the
many
shippers,
trade
associations
and
other
groups
which
supported
the
merger.
even
in
the
face
of
express
recognition
that
competition
might
be
eliminated
or
reduced.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
as
i
can
see
it
sir,
the
difference
between
us
is
this.
the
commission
believes
that
the
improvements
in
transportation
and
the
economies
and
efficiencies
that
the
transaction
will
yield
alone
can
justify
on
balance
the
offsetting
consideration
of
the
loss
of
competition.
as
we
concede,
because
i
understand
the
department's
position,
it
is
in
that
something
else
must
be
cast
into
the
balance.
some
overwriting
public
end,
and
we
submit
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
right.
we
submit
that
--
and
there's
as
the
rewriting
of
the
standard
as
consistently
applied
by
this
court.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
and
that
is
correct.
and
they
--
the
department
transfers
the
sick
company
doctrine
to
--
in
the
railroad
merger
situations
where
we
submit
it
doesn't
obtain.
if
--
and
benefits
will
flow
from
a
merger
and
of
sound
railroads
and
we
believe
the
commission
is
empowered
under
the
statute
to
approve
such
a
merger.
in
short
we
say
that
and
the
department
has
relied
essentially
in
this
case
upon
a
recitation
of
figures
drawn
from
one
or
two
exhibits.
the
figures
which
the
first
report
of
the
commission
itself
recognized
contained
certain
deficiencies
and
as
the
lower
court
agreed,
tend
to
exaggerate
the
competition
which
exists
between
the
northern
lines.
the
commission
viewed
these
figures
in
the
context
of
the
entire
record.
and
we
submit
that
the
commission
indeed
made
the
requisite
judgment
as
to
the
anti-competitive
consequences
that
the
merger
would
bring
about.
we
do
believe
that
consistently
with
this
court's
holding
last
year
in
the
penn-central
merger
cases,
the
commission
has
furthered
the
policy
of
the
congress.
it
is
that
policy
which
produces
a
variation
from
the
traditional
anti-trust
laws
of
insisting
upon
the
privacy
of
competition
as
the
touchstone
of
economic
regulation.
competition
is
merely
one
consideration
here
and
we
think
the
commission
has
adequately
considered
it.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
counsels
for
the
appellees
on
these
consolidated
cases
have
agreed
upon
a
division
of
their
argument.
i
shall
deal
principally
in
--
with
the
illegal
standards
observed
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
approving
the
merger
of
the
northern
lines
responding
to
the
several
contestants
of
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
cox,
a
counsel
for
the
railroads,
will
deal
with
the
several
factual
factors
and
that
went
into
the
decision
to
merge
these
roads,
including
the
many
benefits
to
the
shipping
public
and
that
it
enrolled
offered.
he
additionally
will
respond
to
the
contentions
of
the
northern
pacific
committee.
he
will
be
followed
by
mr.
fred
tolan
on
behalf
of
230
pacific
northwest
shippers
who
will
deal
with
the
merger
principally
from
the
standpoint
of
the
patrons
of
these
roads.
and
finally,
mr.
merrill
and
counsel
for
the
milwaukee
will
treat
specifically
with
the
conditions
attached
by
the
commissions
for
the
protection
of
that
road.
the
public
utility
commissioner
of
oregon
who
had
initially
opposed
the
merger
before
the
commission
now
supports
it.
he,
however,
relies
on
his
brief
and
will
not
separately
argue.
ten
years
ago,
a
committee
of
the
congress
criticized
the
nation's
railroads.
in
a
report
it
said,
the
railroad
industry
has
not
been
sufficiently
interested
in
self-help
in
such
matters
as
consolidations
and
mergers.
and
last
year,
and
this
court
noted
in
the
penn-central
cases
that
the
intervening
years
have
marked
a
tremendous
change
and
that
the
railroads
now
embarked
upon
a
vast
reorganization
of
rail
transportation
implementing
the
congressional
policy
of
encouraging
consolidation
of
the
nation's
railroads
into
a
limited
number
of
systems.
department
of
justice
has
opposed
that
realignment.
at
one
stage
or
another,
the
department
has
opposed
every
major
railroad
consolidation
of
the
past
decade.
its
present
attack
--
the
challenges
of
the
very
premise
upon
which
the
commission
cater
for
has
authorized
and
approved
railroad
mergers
and
the
rationale
upon
which
the
courts
on
review
have
sustained
them.
essentially,
the
question
is
this.
may
a
consolidation
of
railroads
be
held
to
be
in
the
public
interest
upon
the
commission's
finding
of
improved
transportation,
efficiencies
and
economies
that
the
transport
action
itself
will
yield
when
weighed
against
the
facts
of
evidence
at
the
competitive
consequences.
the
commission
and
the
courts
have
said
yes.
the
department
has
unsuccessfully
maintained
in
the
past,
says
no.
its
position
is
that
acknowledged
savings,
operational
improvements
and
service
benefits
flowing
from
the
affiliation
of
railroads
without
more
cannot
serve
and
to
offset
the
loss
of
competition.
the
commission
found
and
a
unanimous
lower
court
agreed,
from
that,
the
merger
would
produce
savings
of
$40
million
annually.
the
commission
found
and
the
lower
court
agreed
that
would
result
in
better
service.
department
does
not
now
seriously
challenge
the
findings
of
savings.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
in
the
second
report
and
your
honor,
the
commission
found
annual
savings
of
$40
million.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
in
the
first
report,
they
estimated
the
savings
to
be
between
12.7
and
25.5
million.
at
the
further
hearing,
evidence
was
introduced
showing
that
the
savings
would
be
substantially
greater.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes
sir.
department
maintains
that
this
merger
cannot
proceed.
it
likens
the
railroad
and
to
the
players
in
the
game
as
reply
brief
says,
four
is
better
than
three,
three
better
than
two
and
two
better
than
one,
but
such
have
not
been
the
rules
of
the
game
for
nearly
half
a
century.
the
transportation
act
of
1920
established
altogether
different
standards,
marking
a
fundamental
change
in
the
scheme
of
railroad
regulation.
by
that
legislation,
the
commission
for
the
first
time
was
empowered
to
authorize
the
improve
--
and
to
authorize
and
approve
now
the
merger
of
railroads
not
withstanding
their
anti-competitive
effects.
indeed,
and
that
legislation
specifically
conferred
anti-trust
immunity
upon
transactions
approved
by
the
commission.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
now,
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
and
that
is
correct
sir
and
before
that
time,
the
mergers
were
governed
solely
by
the
sherman
and
the
clayton
acts
and
it
was
during
this
period
that
this
court
decided
in
northern
security's
case
and
the
southern
pacific
case
consolidation.
now,
following
the
1920
enactment,
two
acquisitions
of
control
have
reached
this
court.
and
i
specifically
invite
this
court's
attention
to
its
decisions
in
the
new
york
central
securities
case
and
the
texas
case.
now,
the
most
dramatic
example
under
the
transportation
act
of
1920
that
the
commission
could
authorize
from
one
railroad's
acquisition
of
control
of
another,
even
in
the
face
of
the
most
serious
anti-competitive
consequences
was
afforded
by
the
southern
pacific
case.
in
1922,
this
court
had
found
that
the
control
of
the
central
pacific
by
the
southern
pacific
violated
the
sherman
act
and
it
ordered
the
divestiture.
southern
pacific,
however,
in
an
effort
to
maintain
control
applied
to
the
commission
for
authorization
under
the
provisions
of
the
transportation
act
of
1920
enacted
subsequently
to
the
beginning
of
the
anti-trust
prosecution.
the
commission
in
its
report
found
that
separation
of
the
lines
would
result
in
more
expensive
and
less
efficient
and
satisfactory
service
that
can
be
rendered
under
unified
control.
it
approved
the
control
of
relationship
and
thereby
validated
the
very
relationship
that
this
court
had
found
to
be
unlawful
the
proceeding
year.
then
none
of
the
cases,
and
decided
by
the
commission
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
utah
have
found
and
that
the
mandate
of
this
court
in
essence
was
satisfied
in
that
no
divestiture
was
required,
the
commission
having
found
the
control
relationship
to
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
it
was
not
reviewed
on
the
merits,
your
honor.
now,
none
of
these
cases
decided
by
the
commission,
some
of
which
were
sustained
by
the
courts
and
it
was
the
commission's
operate
--
authorization
premised
upon
findings
such
as
the
department
now
would
insist
upon.
in
the
face
of
their
evident
anti-competitive
effects
and
the
proposals
were
approved
by
the
commission
upon
commission's
findings
of
improved
transportation,
the
economy's
inefficiencies
that
the
trans-action
itself
would
yield.
the
department
discusses
none
of
these
cases.
it
ignores
altogether
and
to
the
important
cases
of
the
1920
to
1940
formative
period.
by
1940,
it
had
become
apparent
that
the
ambitious
nationwide
plan
of
consolidation
which
was
a
part
of
the
1920
act
was
not
bearing
fruit.
the
transportation
act
of
1940
relieved
the
commission
of
having
to
formulate
the
plan
as
that
it
permits
the
commission
to
approve
carry
their
initiated
voluntary
plans
if
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
and
so
the
40
act
permitted
the
commission
to
approve
acquisitions
--
approve
merges
of
railroads
as
it
previously
had
acquisitions
of
control
subject
only
to
the
standard
of
consistency
with
the
public
interest.
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
the
congressional
purpose
in
this
1940
act
was
to
facilitate
merger
and
consolidation
in
the
national
transportation
system.
the
result
of
the
act
and
it
was
a
change
in
the
means
while
the
end
remained
the
same.
we
do
not
view
svenska
amerika
as
changing
that
and
we
do
not
think
svenska
amerika
--
and
america
can
be
silent
or
in
overruling
decades
of
administrative
and
judicial
construction.
secondly,
and
most
significant,
in
that
proceeding
and
there
were
no
benefits
from
the
transaction
from
the
agreements
offered
for
federal
maritime
commission
approval
and
the
federal
maritime
commission
specifically
so
found.
but
finally,
there
is
no
suggestion
in
svenska
amerika
that
the
kinds
of
improvements,
service
benefits
found
to
flow
from
the
transaction
here
approved
by
the
commission
would
not
satisfy
the
requirement
of
svenska
amerika.
beginning
with
the
decision
in
the
mclean
case
which
incidentally
involved
a
merger
of
seven
motor
carriers
into
the
largest
single
motor
carrier
in
the
united
states.
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
under
the
1940
act
as
under
the
1920
act,
the
achieving
of
an
adequate,
efficient
and
economical
system
of
transportation
was
a
matter
of
paramount
national
concern.
and
the
preservation
of
competition
among
carriers,
although
still
of
value
is
significant
chiefly
as
it
aids
in
the
attainment
of
the
objective
of
the
national
transportation
system.
indeed,
we
show
in
our
brief,
that
some
of
the
very
arguments
in
which
the
department
now
makes
were
considered
and
rejected
by
the
court
in
the
mclean
case.
this
court's
affirmance
in
1967
of
the
seaboard
summary
affirmance
--
in
1967
of
the
seaboard
coastline
merger
under
the
standards
of
the
1940
act
was
one
of
several
occurrences
in
following
the
commission's
first
report
in
the
northern
lines
case
and
contributing
to
its
change
of
mind
in
the
approval
of
the
northern
lines'
merger
in
the
second
report.
in
many
of
the
characteristics
in
the
seaboard
coastline
merger
were
similar
to
that
of
the
northern
lines.
though
from
the
standpoint
of
the
anti-competitive
consequences
flowing
from
the
transaction
and
we
submit
and
that
the
present
merger
poses
even
more,
even
fewer
problems,
less
onerous
and
then
the
early
one
the
early
one,
the
seaboard
coastline.
therein
here,
the
merger
involved
two
relatively
healthy,
parallel
rail
competitors,
dominant
in
expensing
an
economically
significant
section
of
the
country.
although
the
net
earnings
of
seaboard
coastline
and
were
found
by
the
commission
to
be
better
than
they
are
in
the
northern
lines.
there
is
here,
the
merging
railroads
were
each
other's
principal
competitors,
though
again,
the
volume
of
traffic
for
which
they
competed,
was
greater
for
the
seaboard
and
coastline
than
it
is
for
the
northern
lines.
they
in
here
and
the
merger
of
the
railroads
and
denied
some
communities
of
competitive
rail
service.
although
cities
of
the
size
of
tampa,
and
areas
as
extensive
as
central
and
western
florida
served
only
by
the
merged
seaboard
coastline,
are
totally
without
counterpart
in
the
northern
lines
merger.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
only
partially
and
your
honor
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
i
shall.
the
--
commissioner
webb
had
dissented
in
the
seaboard
coastline
case
and
of
course,
he
was
the
author
of
the
commission's
first
report.
and
some
of
his
thinking
as
to
the
--
of
the
–
and
the
necessity
for
preserving
railroad
competition
and
certainly
his
view
in
the
transportation
act
of
1920
of
facilitating
railroad
mergers,
but
this
doctrine
was
not
carried
forward
into
the
1940
act
and
was
evident
in
the
one
as
in
the
other.
and
there
is
certain
amount
of
confusion
as
to
what
the
1940
act
did
and
was
a
factor
in
which
contributed
to
the
second
report.
there's
only
one
of
several.
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
seaboard
coastline
case
and
the
department
as
it
does
here
opposed
the
transaction
and
as
it
does
here,
it
said,
and
without
overriding
public
benefits,
the
transaction
could
not
be
approved.
indeed,
in
the
lower
court
in
its
opinion,
paraphrased
the
position
of
the
department
and
said
and
the
government's
position
really
was
that
where
two
healthy
competitors
are
involved,
economies
or
dollar
savings
and
other
alleged
benefits
should
never
be
enough
and
to
overcome
severe
elimination
of
competition
such
as
here
involved.
of
course,
the
lower
court
rejected
the
department's
argument
and
this
court
summarily
affirmed.
turning
to
other
considerations
which
occurred
between
the
first
and
the
second
report,
the
first
of
these
is
the
accommodation
of
the
employees
of
the
railroads.
in
the
first
report,
the
commission
had
found
some
5200
jobs
on
the
applicant
railroads
that
would
be
eliminated
and
that
the
adverse
effect
due
to
bumping
would
be
even
more
severe.
there's
no
question
that
the
commission
cast
this
into
the
balance
in
favor
the
northern.
now
following
the
first
report,
of
course,
the
railroads
reached
agreements
and
with
the
couple
of
the
unions
providing
for
protection
of
their
members
against
job
losses
except
and
by
attrition.
in
approving
the
merger
in
the
second
report
the
commission
imposed
such
protective
conditions
for
all
employees,
including
those
not
covered
by
the
negotiated
agreements.
another
change
of
course,
was
the
protection
afforded
the
competing
railroads.
excuse
me.
milwaukee
and
northwestern
had
opposed
in
the
merger
unless
certain
conditions
were
attached.
in
turn,
northern
lines
opposed
attachment
of
such
conditions
and
this
led
to
the
commission
to
conclude
in
its
first
report
that
attaching
these
conditions
indeed
might
include,
might
preclude
consummation.
now,
following
the
first
report,
agreements
were
reached
with
the
railroads
and
all
of
the
sought
after
conditions
were
attached.
i
shall
not
discuss
these
conditions
in
detail
and
mr.
merrill
for
milwaukee
shall.
i
simply
wish
to
point
out
that
as
a
result
of
these
conditions,
the
milwaukee
for
the
first
time,
and
we'll
be
able
to
reach
portland,
for
the
first
time,
will
be
able
to
render
service
at
billing
and
incidentally,
this
was
a
new
condition
in
the
second
report,
it
was
not
considered
for
attachment
in
the
first
report.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes
sir.
thirdly,
the
milwaukee,
for
the
first
time
will
be
able
to
participate
in
west
coast
traffic
to
and
from
bridge
columbia
and
for
the
first
time,
the
milwaukee
will
be
able
to
solicit
northern
tier
transcontinental
traffic
originating
at
or
destined
to
points
not
on
its
line
by
being
able
to
interchange
such
traffic
at
competitive
rates
at
11
points
certain
in
timing
with
the
northern
lines.
and
as
the
commission
found,
this
afforded
to
the
shipper
a
slower
club
to
short
haul
in
the
merge
system
in
the
event
that
he
is
not
satisfied
with
the
treatment
he's
getting.
in
its
third
supplemental
report,
the
commission
specifically
opened
these
11
gateways
into
the
transportation
of
grain
destined
for
the
primary
markets
i
minneapolis,
st.
paul
and
sioux
city.
at
these
conditions,
will
make
up
the
milwaukee
a
new
railroad
can
scarcely
be
questioned.
as
i
pointed
out
at
the
outset,
they
were
considered
of
sufficient
consequence
that
the
public
utility
commission
of
oregon
would
oppose
the
merger
before
the
commission
following
the
imposition
of
the
conditions
supported
the
merger.
and
more
importantly,
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
charged
under
the
statute
with
representing
the
agricultural
community
considered
them
to
be
a
benefit
to
the
public
in
general
and
to
the
agricultural
community
in
particular.
and
accordingly
before
the
commission,
he
too
changed
his
position
and
following
imposition
of
the
condition
withdrew
his
opposition
to
the
merger.
lastly,
among
the
conditions
to
obtain
between
the
first
and
second
report,
was
the
receipt
of
additional
evidence
as
to
the
savings.
in
the
first
report,
as
i
indicated
before
in
response
and
to
the
question
to
mr.
justice
harlan
the
commission
had
found,
i
believe
it
was,
the
commission
had
found
that
the
savings
might
be
$25.5
million.
however,
without
explanation
and
bringing
this
figure
down
to
its
conclusion,
the
commission
found
that
the
savings
might
only
reach
$12.7
million.
and
it
was
this
figure,
the
range
of
$12.7
million
to
$25.5
million
annually
a
guess
at
which
the
commission
measured
the
anti-competitive
consequences.
following
the
receipt
of
additional
evidence,
the
analysis
of
additional
studies
and
the
commission
concluded
that
the
annual
savings
would
approach
$40
million
and
the
lower
court
agreed.
in
reaching
this
conclusion,
i
might
point
out
that
the
commission
did
indeed
consider
the
possibility
and
that
certain
savings,
certain
improvements
might
be
achieved
short
of
merger
by
the
coordination
of
facilities.
at
best,
these
would
have
yielded
as
the
commission
found
at
300
of
the
record,
as
the
commission
mentioned
that
300
of
the
record
a
$5.2
million,
but
the
commission
went
on
to
state
specifically
many
of
the
coordinations
though
physically
feasible
will
produce
grossly
unequal
benefits
to
great
northern,
northern
pacific
a
separate
carriers.
further,
in
a
competition
between
the
northern
lines,
it
renders
it
difficult
if
not
impossible
as
a
practical
matter
to
incur
the
expense
involved
in
effecting
such
coordination.
it
is
against
these
benefits
then
that
the
lessening
of
competition
the
commission
said
must
be
weighed.
and
that
there
will
be
a
very
substantial
lessening
of
competition
has
never
been
questioned.
the
commission
referred
to
this
as
an
undisputed
fact.
and
as
--
indeed
as
i
believe
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
this
morning,
it's
scarcely
possible
to
conceive
of
a
significant
merger
of
railroads
in
an
area
that
would
not
be
anti-competitive.
but
that
is
not
to
say
that
these
anti-competitive
consequences
can
be
ignored
by
the
commission.
and
the
commission
very
carefully
referring
to
this
court's
decision
in
mcclain,
in
minneapolis,
in
seaboard
coastline
said
that
it
has
a
duty
to
estimate
the
scope
and
appraise
the
effects
of
the
curtailment
of
competition
which
will
result
from
the
proposed
consolidation
and
consider
them
along
with
the
advantages
of
improved
service,
safer
operations,
lower
cost,
etcetera
to
determine
whether
the
consolidation
will
assist
in
effectuating
overall
transportation
policy.
this
we
submit,
the
commission
has
done.
the
commission
noted
that
great
northern
and
northern
pacific
are
competitive
and
that
their
lines
extend
generally
through
the
same
northern
tier
states
and
from
seattle
and
portland
on
the
west,
to
duluth
superior,
minneapolis,
saint
paul
on
the
east,
but
they
are
also
complementary
and
that
the
great
northern's
principle
mileage
is
in
the
east
and
northern
pacific's
in
the
west.
and
while
their
lines
are
parallel
and
great
northern
primarily
serves
northern
communities
in
the
northern
tier
states,
and
while
the
northern
pacific
serves
those
towards
the
south.
and
at
many
points
as
the
commission
pointed
out
as
between
helena
and
shelby,
montana
the
main
lines
of
these
railroads
are
several
--
are
better
than
a
hundred
miles
apart.
and
the
commission
pointed
out
that
obviously
a
shipper
located
on
or
near
in
the
line
on
one
road,
and
but
50
or
100
miles
from
the
line
of
another
is
not
influenced
by
the
competition
in
the
selection
of
the
carriers.
in
our
brief,
we
offer
many
examples.
we
quote
for
example
a
montana
grain
dealer
who
has
elevators
near
the
northern
pacific
tracks,
and
he
said,
“for
the
most
part,
the
grain
has
to
move
on
the
railroad
pretty
close
to
where
it's
grown.
for
instance
i
can't
ship
on
the
milwaukee
if
it
even
if
their
rate
is
zero.
”the
commission
in
the
second
report
indeed
recognized
and
that
the
northern
tier
states
are
rich
in
animal,
mineral,
agricultural
and
forest
resources.
it
recognized
full
well
that
this
cost,
this
traffic
constitutes
as
mr.
mclaren
pointed
out,
approximately
60%
of
the
traffic
originated
by
these
roads
in
this
area.
as
--
it
is
for
this
very
traffic
that
rail
transportation
offers
the
most
and
distinct
competitive
advantage
to
use
as
phrase,
were
the
greatest
inherent
advantages.
but
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
with
respect
to
this
very
traffic,
80%
comes
from
points
that
are
none
competitive
between
the
merging
railroads.
the
department
at
no
time
has
challenged
these
figures,
neither
has
the
department
ever
challenged
the
fact
and
the
truck
competition
has
become
very
pervasive
at
least
as
to
one
category
of
products,
manufacture
and
miscellaneous
products.
it
was
with
respect
to
this
category
of
traffic
and
that
the
commission
specifically
found
in
the
second
report
that
these
railroads
are
most
vulnerable
to
motor
carrier
competition.
it
found
moreover
that
it
is
this
traffic
that
the
rail
carriers
must
retain
to
balance
their
operations
in
handling
the
products
of
the
agricultural
and
extracted
industries.
the
record
establishes
and
the
commission
so
found
that
this
category
of
traffic
manufactured
in
miscellaneous
products
constitutes
more
than
30%
of
the
great
northern's
carload
revenue
and
nearly
40%
of
the
northern
pacific,
and
for
both
road
its
the
single
most
important
category
of
traffic.
now
with
respect
to
the
much
quoted
in
exhibit
16
referred
to
in
the
commission's
report,
second
report
in
the
vicinity
of
page
316
of
the
record.
the
commission
acknowledged
full
well
and
its
second
report
as
it
had
in
its
first
that
rail
competition
will
be
eliminated
entirely
at
47
communities
in
the
northern
tier.
however,
the
commission
went
on
and
to
point
that
the
number
of
stations
is
small,
being
less
than
5%
of
the
stations
in
those
very
states,
and
it
went
on
to
point
out
that
these
stations
produced
an
insubstantial
volume
of
applicant's
business,
approximately
6%
whether
measured
by
cars
or
revenue.
additionally,
the
commission
found
with
these
so
called
class
--
with
respect
to
these
so
called
class
one
points
that
some
of
them
are
located
on
the
main
line
of
one
applicant
and
on
the
branch
line
of
another
and
with
the
result
that
the
loss
of
competition
is
more
theoretical
than
real.
helena,
montana
is
a
perfectly
good
example,
it
being
on
the
main
line
of
the
northern
pacific,
but
on
the
branch
line
of
the
great
northern.
with
respect
to
the
class
two
stations,
those
served
by
two
or
more
of
the
applicant
railroads
and
at
least
one
other
railroad,
the
commission
acknowledged
in
its
second
report
as
it
had
in
the
first
that
rail
competition
will
be
diminished,
but
not
eliminate
it
at
these
160
stations.
it
recognized
in
the
second
report
as
it
had
in
the
first
that
these
stations
contribute
about
33%
of
the
cars
and
38%
of
the
revenue
of
the
northern
lines
in
this
area.
mr.
mclaren
would
add
all
these
figures
including
overhead
traffic
and
tell
you
that
the
railroad's
merger
would
result
in
a
loss
of
competition
of
55%.
mr.
mclaren
forgets
however,
that
the
addition
of
the
bridge
traffic
it
increases
its
universe
and
as
the
examiner
found
at
page
770
of
the
record,
771,
if
bridge
traffic
were
included
that
percentage
of
the
total
traffic
handled
in
1960
at
the
stations
where
there
will
be
a
reduction
in
the
number
of
rail
carriers
would
be
smaller
than
the
figures
subsequently
shown.
we
point
out
that
at
nearly
two
thirds
of
these
class
two
stations
served
by
two
of
the
applicants
and
one
other
road,
with
respect
to
these,
we
point
out
that
97
and
out
of
the
160
stations,
nearly
two
thirds
all
occur
at
four
places;
seattle,
spokane,
minneapolis,
saint
paul,
duluth,
superior.
and
it
is
with
respect
to
these
points
that
the
commission
in
its
second
report
specifically
found
that
following
the
merger,
none
would
be
served
by
fewer
than
three
railroads
nor
fewer
than
15
truck
lines.
the
commission
in
its
second
report
pointed
out
that
even
though
some
of
the
points
show
up
as
class
two
stations
reflecting
service
by
two
or
more
of
the
applicant
railroads
and
at
least
one
other,
they
do
not
have
competition
between
the
applicants
today.
for
example,
the
largest
community
in
the
northern
tier
which
would
be
left
without
competitive
rail
service
as
a
result
of
the
merger
is
pasco,
washington.
at
pasco,
washington
the
northern
pacific
comes
in
from
one
direction,
and
the
sp&s
goes
out
in
another
direction
and
the
competition
between
them
is
really
nonexistent.
as
to
all
of
the
points,
all
of
the
class
two
points,
the
commission
found
first
apportionment
of
traffic
between
great
northern
and
northern
pacific
and
the
other
road
serving
these
points
is
not
wholly
the
result
of
interplay
of
competitive
forces,
but
often
results
from
other
factors
entirely.
second,
the
shippers
at
these
class
two
locations
in
addition
to
the
northern
lines
and
one
other
rail
carrier,
are
generally
served
by
other
modes
of
transportation
vigorously
competing
for
traffic.
and
third,
by
virtue
of
the
conditions
imposed
in
this
case,
the
milwaukee
which
is
the
other
railroad
serving
many
of
the
class
two
points
will
be
substantially
strengthened
as
a
meaningful
transcontinental
competitor.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
i
believe
the
argument
has
been
held
before
the
commission
and
the
report
of
the
commission
is
being
awaited.
beginning
at
page
48
of
our
brief,
we
offer
examples
drawn
from
the
record
which
fully
support
he
commission's
findings.
we
show
how
some
shippers
and
this
is
particularly
true
of
the
large
national
accounts,
simply
allocate
traffic
as
between
available
rail
carriers.
we
show
the
number,
the
growth
and
the
activity
of
truck
lines
at
the
class
two
points.
at
fargo
for
example,
20
motor
carriers
compete
for
traffic
with
the
railroad
and
the
record
establishes
in
that
50%
of
the
less
than
car
load
merchandise
traffic
received
there
arrives
by
truck.
and
we
point
out
that
the
commission
found
that
the
milwaukee
has
shorter
routes
and
superior
rate
and
will
offer
competitive
service
right
through
the
heart
of
the
northern
tier
serving
most
of
the
class
two
stations.
moreover,
the
commission
in
its
second
report
accorded
much
weight
to
the
many
shippers,
trade
associations
and
other
groups
which
supported
the
merger.
even
in
the
face
of
express
recognition
that
competition
might
be
eliminated
or
reduced.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
as
i
can
see
it
sir,
the
difference
between
us
is
this.
the
commission
believes
that
the
improvements
in
transportation
and
the
economies
and
efficiencies
that
the
transaction
will
yield
alone
can
justify
on
balance
the
offsetting
consideration
of
the
loss
of
competition.
as
we
concede,
because
i
understand
the
department's
position,
it
is
in
that
something
else
must
be
cast
into
the
balance.
some
overwriting
public
end,
and
we
submit
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
right.
we
submit
that
--
and
there's
as
the
rewriting
of
the
standard
as
consistently
applied
by
this
court.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
and
that
is
correct.
and
they
--
the
department
transfers
the
sick
company
doctrine
to
--
in
the
railroad
merger
situations
where
we
submit
it
doesn't
obtain.
if
--
and
benefits
will
flow
from
a
merger
and
of
sound
railroads
and
we
believe
the
commission
is
empowered
under
the
statute
to
approve
such
a
merger.
in
short
we
say
that
and
the
department
has
relied
essentially
in
this
case
upon
a
recitation
of
figures
drawn
from
one
or
two
exhibits.
the
figures
which
the
first
report
of
the
commission
itself
recognized
contained
certain
deficiencies
and
as
the
lower
court
agreed,
tend
to
exaggerate
the
competition
which
exists
between
the
northern
lines.
the
commission
viewed
these
figures
in
the
context
of
the
entire
record.
and
we
submit
that
the
commission
indeed
made
the
requisite
judgment
as
to
the
anti-competitive
consequences
that
the
merger
would
bring
about.
we
do
believe
that
consistently
with
this
court's
holding
last
year
in
the
penn-central
merger
cases,
the
commission
has
furthered
the
policy
of
the
congress.
it
is
that
policy
which
produces
a
variation
from
the
traditional
anti-trust
laws
of
insisting
upon
the
privacy
of
competition
as
the
touchstone
of
economic
regulation.
competition
is
merely
one
consideration
here
and
we
think
the
commission
has
adequately
considered
it.
