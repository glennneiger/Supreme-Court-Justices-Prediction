mr.
fred
h.
tolan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
speak
only
for
the
shippers
and
receivers
of
freight
here
today.
shippers
want
and
need
this
merger
as
it’s
now
conditioned.
i
appear
for
230
intervenor-shipper
receivers
who
will
cover
over
1,000
actual
shippers
and
receivers
of
freight
from
the
very
smallest
industries
of
the
west
to
some
of
the
largest
out
there.
we
want
this
merger
because
it
will
help
us
tremendously.
the
scope
of
people
that
are
covered
by
the
appearance
here
today
run
from
poll
of
car
shippers,
fish,
clothing,
furniture,
peat
moss,
almost
every
aspect
of
business.
the
complete
list
of
whom
i
speak
here
today
are
covered
on
page
2
of
my
brief
and
page
1312
of
the
appendix
list
all
the
230
interventions
for
whom
i
speak.
this
merger
is
a
good
merger.
it’s
a
merger
in
the
public
interest.
it
will
reduce
transportation
cost,
it
will
speed
service,
and
it
will
improve
and
i
emphasize
the
word
“improve
competition
beyond
anything
that
we
have
today.”
the
shipping
public
virtually
to
amend
and
i
emphasize
that
word
“virtually
to
amend”
is
solidly
behind
this
merger
as
directed
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
before
this
court
today.
we
cannot
support
the
department
of
justice’s
position
for
what
they
would
provide
by
their
solution
as
a
mere
aspirin
when
what
the
shipping
public
needs
is
the
surgery
of
this
type
of
action.
the
position
of
the
department
is
not
realistic.
it
will
not
give
the
shippers
the
benefits
and
the
competitive
safeguards
at
the
interstate
commerce
commission
order
give
us.
for
that
reason,
we
support
the
order
before
the
court
today.
now,
i
want
to
be
specific,
i
want
to
be
very
specific
because
basically
my
part
of
the
presentation
is
to
give
the
facts
of
the
benefit
of
the
public
in
this
merger.
here
are
the
basic
points
i
would
like
to
touch
on
in
the
time
that
i
have
here.
first,
the
direct
shipper
benefits
from
the
great
northern
pacific
burlington
merger.
the
second
thing
goes
many
added
benefits
that
we
get
from
a
new
and
revitalized
milwaukee
railroad.
the
third
thing
is
the
vast
amount
of
competitive
traffic
that
will
be
available
to
us
to
protect
us
after
the
merger
is
accomplished.
fourth,
the
tremendous
number
of
safeguards
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
built-in
to
the
order
that’s
before
this
court
today
to
protect
us
from
great
discrimination
and
service
discriminations.
some
really
wonderful
safeguards
and
lastly,
the
$40
million
saving,
the
benefits
that
will
directly
accrued
to
the
shipping
public
from
the
manifesting
of
those
savings
to
the
shipping
and
to
the
railroads
involved.
now
coming
specifically,
are
the
shippers
that
i
represent
here
today
are
they
the
pawns
of
the
railroad,
are
we
the
ones
swayed
by
the
brochure?
the
answer
is
no.
we
intervened
in
the
case,
disagreed,
i
emphasize
the
word
“disagreed”
with
northern
lines
and
took
an
independent
position
with
independent
witnesses,
independent
counsel,
and
it
was
only
after
the
petition
for
reconsideration
came
in
that
we
are
altogether.
right
from
the
start,
we
felt
there
had
to
be
conditions
for
the
milwaukee
railroad.
there
had
to
be
a
merger,
but
there
had
to
be
conditions
and
we
fought
valuably
for
something
over
10
years
even
before
the
official
filing
to
accomplish
this
end
result
that’s
before
the
court
today.
now,
the
shippers
are
uniquely
situated
to
judge
the
effectiveness.
our
people
in
over
50,000
car
loads
of
freight
are
aggregated
in
the
shippers
for
whom
i
speak
here
today.
we
have
studied
this,
we
have
lived
with
it
for
10
years,
we
participated
in
every
phase
of
the
action
from
an
independent
status
position
and
we
believe
we
do
have
the
facts
that
will
justify
to
this
court
why
we
think
the
merger
should
be
approved
by
the
court.
first,
if
i
could
touch
on
the
direct
benefits
from
the
gn
and
np
burlington
merger
without
touching
on
the
milwaukee.
first
is
faster
service.
that
cannot
be
--
the
value
of
that
cannot
be
over
estimated.
it
includes
–
it
increases
a
shelf
life
of
our
perishables,
or
apples
or
potatoes
or
lettuce
that
reduces
the
inventory
requirements
for
stocks
out
in
the
west
where
we
have
such
tremendous
distances
and
reduces
icing
and
refrigeration
cost.
it
produces
less
inventory
requirements.
all
of
this
is
tremendous
to
us.
it
will
make
one
the
two
days
difference
into
the
kansas
city
mid-west
markets
and
at
least
the
day’s
net
final
difference
to
as
to
and
from
the
chicago
markets
not
on
hotshot
when
train
west-bound
the
day.
but
on
basic
all
freight
that
is
so
critical
to
the
marketing
of
the
pacific
northwest.
we
will
have
faster
north-south
as
well
as
east-west
service.
a
second
part
of
this
is
the
dependability
of
the
service.
after
this
merger,
the
merged
railroads
will
have
two
not
one
line
which
will
give
us
dependability
when
there
is
whether
washout,
derailments
and
other
things
that
repeatedly
occur
on
railroads
of
the
type
of
operation
here.
but
more
importantly
on
the
dependability
is
the
fact
that
they
will
be
using
vastly
shorter
routes
to
and
from
the
key
market.
for
example,
the
record
shows
right
now
that
15
million
car
miles
a
day
will
be
--
or
car
miles
a
year
will
be
saved
by
the
new
short
routes
that
will
utilized
by
this
merge
line
in
the
operation
after
merger
is
accomplished.
they’ll
do
that
by
running
more
traffic
through
the
laurel-billings
area
that
now
goes
through
missouri
river
gateways.
they’ll
do
it
by
using
the
best
and
the
shortest
parts
of
the
combined
systems
such
as
was
touched
on
earlier
by
other
speakers.
they’ll
do
that
by
making
improvements
in
north-south
as
well
as
east-west
routings.
now,
the
third
great
thing
is
the
improved
transit
privileges.
unfortunately,
in
the
west
we
raise
strawberries
in
one
area,
beans
in
another
area,
and
we
must
put
those
together
to
get
the
advantages
of
low
rates.
that
means
stop
and
transit
to
complete
loading
to
make
the
necessary
mix
the
customers’
want.
they
don’t
want
a
straight
car
load
of
strawberries
or
beans,
they
want
a
mix.
we
can
start
at
one
point
and
complete
on
another.
at
the
present
time,
we
have
to
do
essentially
all
on
the
gn
or
essentially
all
on
the
np
after
merger
the
scope
of
the
mix
vastly
improved.
the
ability
to
fabricate
lumber
and
other
products
that
are
fabricated
or
equally
done,
grain
and
flower,
and
feed
will
be
able
to
draw
cross
lines
where
they
now
are
restricted
just
to
the
gn
or
just
to
the
np
for
the
transit
privileges.
all
of
those
are
tremendous
advantages.
now
a
better
car
supply
actually
61,555
car
days
will
be
eliminated
by
having
one
pool
instead
of
three
pools
of
equipment.
financially,
able
railroads
will
be
able
to
buy
more
equipment
and
they
are
able
to
not
buy
now
which
are
essentially
based
on
earnings.
we
get
new
cars
when
railroads
are
profitable.
we
don’t
get
these
cars
when
railroads
aren’t
unprofitable.
unfortunately,
car
supply
now
is
diminished.
faster
routes,
the
faster
routes
as
i
touched
on
earlier
will
save
639,000
car
days
a
year
by
using
the
faster
routes
rather
than
the
longer
circuitous
routes
now.
then
again,
this
case
is
badly
oriented
east
and
west.
we
think
there
has
been
a
myopic
view
of
this
case
and
that
it
is
a
tremendous
north-south
impact
railroad.
we
will
get
an
end
of
the
stranglehold
of
the
sp
on
the
north-south
traffic
by
making
a
new
gateway
at
kalama
falls
that
will
enable
this
line
to
interchange
traffic
at
kalama
falls
giving
them
a
roughly
half
of
the
whole
traffic
between
north
and
south
that
we
do
not
have
today.
we’ll
have
a
new
northern
pacific
gateway
with
the
western
pacific
which
we
don’t
have
today.
now,
another
great
benefit
is
job
security.
we
fought
valuably
for
conditions
for
labor
on
this
one
and
now
all
labor
has
virtually
lifetime
jobs
in
the
city
of
auburn
that
is
before
you
hear
today
are
not
before
you
hear
today
but
in
pleadings
to
the
court.
we
now
have
the
assurance
that
the
yards
are
staying
in
auburn,
they
are
growing
there.
it’s
a
boom
area
of
our
part
of
the
country
that
is
you
put
grass
in
the
street
kind
of
concept.
there
is
not
to
be
no
job
impairment
and
the
security
that
gives
business
to
know
that
that’s
going
to
be
there.
now,
the
last
important
benefit
directly
from
the
gn
and
np
merger
is
this,
this
was
saved
about
$40
million
a
year.
now,
will
that
go
to
the
shippers?
we
know
it
will
go
to
the
shippers
for
justice
reason.
the
railroads
in
the
last
18
months
that
had
thee
separate
rate
increases
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
3%,
5%
then
10
days
ago
just
10
days
ago
they
asked
another
6%
all
based
on
added
cost
of
operation.
as
shipper’s
we
know
the
only
way
that
we
can
get
rates
down
or
not
hold
them
down,
not
let
them
get
down
but
just
hold
them
from
going
out
of
the
moon
is
to
get
lower
cost
of
operation.
this
merger
will
save
$40
million
a
year
and
coincidentally
that
would
be
just
about
the
equivalent
of
6%
that’s
before
the
commission
today
for
rate
increase.
it’s
that
important
to
the
shipping
public.
now,
beyond
those
tremendous
benefits
before
the
gn
and
np
merger,
what
do
we
get
as
added
benefits
it’s
because
we
get
new
milwaukee
railroad
and
we
do
get
a
new
milwaukee.
we
get
a
revitalized
east-west
railroad
with
the
ability
to
take
long
hauls
instead
of
being
cut-off
at
the
pocket
at
st.
paul.
now,
they
have
to
give
all
traffic
to
the
gn
and
np
at
st.
paul.
now,
they’ll
be
able
to
haul
it,
clear
out
as
far
west
to
seattle
and
spokane.
we’ll
get
a
new
north-south
railroad
because
we
have
no
milwaukee
connection
south
of
longview
to
dayville
go
into
portland
and
we’ll
have
a
brand
new
competitive
line
there.
we’ll
have
a
new
canadian
railroad
with
high
speed
service
to
in
and
from
the
sumas
area.
we’ll
have
another
railroad
in
billings,
the
milwaukee.
in
the
bellingham
area,
we
will
have
a
vastly
improved
service
there.
fast
industrial
lands
and
properties
on
the
milwaukee
that
no
sensible
industry
could
locate
on
because
of
their
absence
of
proper
rates
and
routes
because
of
their
limited
coverage
and
other
deficiencies
will
be
opened
for
industrial
development
and
beyond
all
of
that,
this
should
make
such
a
substantial
improvement
in
the
revenue
position
of
the
milwaukee
railroad
that
they
will
be
a
vital
competitor
even
better
than
they
are
today.
now,
after
the
merger,
those
are
the
benefits
of
the
milwaukee.
are
we
going
to
be
left
then
with
the
withdrawal
of
the
gn
competition
with
something
of
a
vacuum
of
competition?
to
me,
it’s
unbelievable
that
such
insertion
could
be
made
to
the
court
here
and
to
the
courts
below
and
to
the
commission.
for
example,
the
union
pacific,
the
union
pacific
will
handle
over
100,000
cars
of
loaded
freight
through
the
huntington,
oregon
gateway
to
and
from
the
pacific
northwest.
if
that’s
with
competition
it’s
certainly
not
the
adjective
that
shippers
would
use.
after
the
merger,
the
great
northern
pacific
merger
of
the
up
holding
just
the
business
they
have
today
would
handle
still
about
25%
of
the
business
of
the
north-west.
we’ll
have
the
strengthened
milwaukee.
the
sp
will
handle
42%
of
the
business
out
of
the
state
of
oregon.
now,
those
tremendous
it
says
from
the
competitive
railroads
that
will
exist
plus
the
cpr-soo
are
a
vital
importance
to
--
or
a
vital
importance
to
us
in
giving
us
competition
for
the
future.
beyond
that,
we
will
have
transcontinental
truck
lines,
eight
new
ones
since
this
case
was
filed.
we
have
exempt
trucks.
we
have
a
vast
amount
of
trucking
covering
everything
from
lowest
rated
to
high
rated
traffic.
now,
the
last
important
--
the
last
major
point
i
would
like
to
make
is,
what
safeguards
has
the
interstate
commerce
commission
built-in
to
their
order
that
will
protect
us
from
great
discriminations
and
service
discriminations
if
this
court
approves
that
order?
the
most
important
thing
is
this.
the
long
and
short
of
provisions
of
section
4
of
the
act
will
prevent
any
competitive
or
totally
non-competitive
point
from
being
charged
more
than
the
next
beyond
the
point.
that
makes
with
236
competitive
points
on
this
railroad
that
would
give
a
fantastic
amount
of
long
and
short
to
a
rate
protection
that
is
iron
clad
and
is
not
waived
anywhere
in
this
order.
we’ll
have
rate
protection
because
the
competitive
rates
will
serve
at
the
maximum
at
any
intermediate
point.
beyond
that,
we
have
the
ability
to
short
hold
the
gn
and
np
by
giving
the
traffic
to
the
milwaukee.
for
example,
in
the
columbia
basin
if
they
would
not
give
proper
car
supply
we
could
take
the
gn
and
np
and
turn
the
traffic
over
to
the
milwaukee
at
spoken
to
take
on
to
chicago.
we
will
have
at
least
eight
other
routes
such
as
the
western
pacific
the
sewer
line
route,
the
rates
by
the
cpr-soo,
the
rates
via
the
union
pacific
and
those
via
the
western
pacific.
beyond
that,
the
commission
has
even
gone
this
far.
they
have
given
us
at
five
years
safety
valve,
any
of
us,
the
shipper
or
injured
railroad
or
other
injured
party
can
come
back
to
this
commission
any
time
within
five
years
and
say
we
have
been
treated
unfairly,
we
need
help
and
the
commission
is
holding
this
record
open
to
take
care
of
that.
then
the
last
thing
is
our
own
state
commissions
who
do
not
oppose
this
merger
now
will
be
able
to
bring
their
best
influences
to
bear.
now,
in
inclusion
i
would
like
to
say
this,
there
is
no
labor
opposition
before
this
court
today.
there
is
no
state
opposition
here.
the
department
of
agriculture
supports
the
merger
and
the
department
of
defense
does
not
oppose
it.
no
shipper
opposition,
no
chamber
port
or
other
group
is
here
opposing
this
merger.
the
icc
obviously
supports
it
not
one
railroad
is
here
contesting
this
for
all
of
those
reasons,
we
respectfully
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
and
allow
the
merger
to
proceed
forthwith.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
fred
h.
tolan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
speak
only
for
the
shippers
and
receivers
of
freight
here
today.
shippers
want
and
need
this
merger
as
it’s
now
conditioned.
i
appear
for
230
intervenor-shipper
receivers
who
will
cover
over
1,000
actual
shippers
and
receivers
of
freight
from
the
very
smallest
industries
of
the
west
to
some
of
the
largest
out
there.
we
want
this
merger
because
it
will
help
us
tremendously.
the
scope
of
people
that
are
covered
by
the
appearance
here
today
run
from
poll
of
car
shippers,
fish,
clothing,
furniture,
peat
moss,
almost
every
aspect
of
business.
the
complete
list
of
whom
i
speak
here
today
are
covered
on
page
2
of
my
brief
and
page
1312
of
the
appendix
list
all
the
230
interventions
for
whom
i
speak.
this
merger
is
a
good
merger.
it’s
a
merger
in
the
public
interest.
it
will
reduce
transportation
cost,
it
will
speed
service,
and
it
will
improve
and
i
emphasize
the
word
“improve
competition
beyond
anything
that
we
have
today.”
the
shipping
public
virtually
to
amend
and
i
emphasize
that
word
“virtually
to
amend”
is
solidly
behind
this
merger
as
directed
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
before
this
court
today.
we
cannot
support
the
department
of
justice’s
position
for
what
they
would
provide
by
their
solution
as
a
mere
aspirin
when
what
the
shipping
public
needs
is
the
surgery
of
this
type
of
action.
the
position
of
the
department
is
not
realistic.
it
will
not
give
the
shippers
the
benefits
and
the
competitive
safeguards
at
the
interstate
commerce
commission
order
give
us.
for
that
reason,
we
support
the
order
before
the
court
today.
now,
i
want
to
be
specific,
i
want
to
be
very
specific
because
basically
my
part
of
the
presentation
is
to
give
the
facts
of
the
benefit
of
the
public
in
this
merger.
here
are
the
basic
points
i
would
like
to
touch
on
in
the
time
that
i
have
here.
first,
the
direct
shipper
benefits
from
the
great
northern
pacific
burlington
merger.
the
second
thing
goes
many
added
benefits
that
we
get
from
a
new
and
revitalized
milwaukee
railroad.
the
third
thing
is
the
vast
amount
of
competitive
traffic
that
will
be
available
to
us
to
protect
us
after
the
merger
is
accomplished.
fourth,
the
tremendous
number
of
safeguards
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
built-in
to
the
order
that’s
before
this
court
today
to
protect
us
from
great
discrimination
and
service
discriminations.
some
really
wonderful
safeguards
and
lastly,
the
$40
million
saving,
the
benefits
that
will
directly
accrued
to
the
shipping
public
from
the
manifesting
of
those
savings
to
the
shipping
and
to
the
railroads
involved.
now
coming
specifically,
are
the
shippers
that
i
represent
here
today
are
they
the
pawns
of
the
railroad,
are
we
the
ones
swayed
by
the
brochure?
the
answer
is
no.
we
intervened
in
the
case,
disagreed,
i
emphasize
the
word
“disagreed”
with
northern
lines
and
took
an
independent
position
with
independent
witnesses,
independent
counsel,
and
it
was
only
after
the
petition
for
reconsideration
came
in
that
we
are
altogether.
right
from
the
start,
we
felt
there
had
to
be
conditions
for
the
milwaukee
railroad.
there
had
to
be
a
merger,
but
there
had
to
be
conditions
and
we
fought
valuably
for
something
over
10
years
even
before
the
official
filing
to
accomplish
this
end
result
that’s
before
the
court
today.
now,
the
shippers
are
uniquely
situated
to
judge
the
effectiveness.
our
people
in
over
50,000
car
loads
of
freight
are
aggregated
in
the
shippers
for
whom
i
speak
here
today.
we
have
studied
this,
we
have
lived
with
it
for
10
years,
we
participated
in
every
phase
of
the
action
from
an
independent
status
position
and
we
believe
we
do
have
the
facts
that
will
justify
to
this
court
why
we
think
the
merger
should
be
approved
by
the
court.
first,
if
i
could
touch
on
the
direct
benefits
from
the
gn
and
np
burlington
merger
without
touching
on
the
milwaukee.
first
is
faster
service.
that
cannot
be
--
the
value
of
that
cannot
be
over
estimated.
it
includes
–
it
increases
a
shelf
life
of
our
perishables,
or
apples
or
potatoes
or
lettuce
that
reduces
the
inventory
requirements
for
stocks
out
in
the
west
where
we
have
such
tremendous
distances
and
reduces
icing
and
refrigeration
cost.
it
produces
less
inventory
requirements.
all
of
this
is
tremendous
to
us.
it
will
make
one
the
two
days
difference
into
the
kansas
city
mid-west
markets
and
at
least
the
day’s
net
final
difference
to
as
to
and
from
the
chicago
markets
not
on
hotshot
when
train
west-bound
the
day.
but
on
basic
all
freight
that
is
so
critical
to
the
marketing
of
the
pacific
northwest.
we
will
have
faster
north-south
as
well
as
east-west
service.
a
second
part
of
this
is
the
dependability
of
the
service.
after
this
merger,
the
merged
railroads
will
have
two
not
one
line
which
will
give
us
dependability
when
there
is
whether
washout,
derailments
and
other
things
that
repeatedly
occur
on
railroads
of
the
type
of
operation
here.
but
more
importantly
on
the
dependability
is
the
fact
that
they
will
be
using
vastly
shorter
routes
to
and
from
the
key
market.
for
example,
the
record
shows
right
now
that
15
million
car
miles
a
day
will
be
--
or
car
miles
a
year
will
be
saved
by
the
new
short
routes
that
will
utilized
by
this
merge
line
in
the
operation
after
merger
is
accomplished.
they’ll
do
that
by
running
more
traffic
through
the
laurel-billings
area
that
now
goes
through
missouri
river
gateways.
they’ll
do
it
by
using
the
best
and
the
shortest
parts
of
the
combined
systems
such
as
was
touched
on
earlier
by
other
speakers.
they’ll
do
that
by
making
improvements
in
north-south
as
well
as
east-west
routings.
now,
the
third
great
thing
is
the
improved
transit
privileges.
unfortunately,
in
the
west
we
raise
strawberries
in
one
area,
beans
in
another
area,
and
we
must
put
those
together
to
get
the
advantages
of
low
rates.
that
means
stop
and
transit
to
complete
loading
to
make
the
necessary
mix
the
customers’
want.
they
don’t
want
a
straight
car
load
of
strawberries
or
beans,
they
want
a
mix.
we
can
start
at
one
point
and
complete
on
another.
at
the
present
time,
we
have
to
do
essentially
all
on
the
gn
or
essentially
all
on
the
np
after
merger
the
scope
of
the
mix
vastly
improved.
the
ability
to
fabricate
lumber
and
other
products
that
are
fabricated
or
equally
done,
grain
and
flower,
and
feed
will
be
able
to
draw
cross
lines
where
they
now
are
restricted
just
to
the
gn
or
just
to
the
np
for
the
transit
privileges.
all
of
those
are
tremendous
advantages.
now
a
better
car
supply
actually
61,555
car
days
will
be
eliminated
by
having
one
pool
instead
of
three
pools
of
equipment.
financially,
able
railroads
will
be
able
to
buy
more
equipment
and
they
are
able
to
not
buy
now
which
are
essentially
based
on
earnings.
we
get
new
cars
when
railroads
are
profitable.
we
don’t
get
these
cars
when
railroads
aren’t
unprofitable.
unfortunately,
car
supply
now
is
diminished.
faster
routes,
the
faster
routes
as
i
touched
on
earlier
will
save
639,000
car
days
a
year
by
using
the
faster
routes
rather
than
the
longer
circuitous
routes
now.
then
again,
this
case
is
badly
oriented
east
and
west.
we
think
there
has
been
a
myopic
view
of
this
case
and
that
it
is
a
tremendous
north-south
impact
railroad.
we
will
get
an
end
of
the
stranglehold
of
the
sp
on
the
north-south
traffic
by
making
a
new
gateway
at
kalama
falls
that
will
enable
this
line
to
interchange
traffic
at
kalama
falls
giving
them
a
roughly
half
of
the
whole
traffic
between
north
and
south
that
we
do
not
have
today.
we’ll
have
a
new
northern
pacific
gateway
with
the
western
pacific
which
we
don’t
have
today.
now,
another
great
benefit
is
job
security.
we
fought
valuably
for
conditions
for
labor
on
this
one
and
now
all
labor
has
virtually
lifetime
jobs
in
the
city
of
auburn
that
is
before
you
hear
today
are
not
before
you
hear
today
but
in
pleadings
to
the
court.
we
now
have
the
assurance
that
the
yards
are
staying
in
auburn,
they
are
growing
there.
it’s
a
boom
area
of
our
part
of
the
country
that
is
you
put
grass
in
the
street
kind
of
concept.
there
is
not
to
be
no
job
impairment
and
the
security
that
gives
business
to
know
that
that’s
going
to
be
there.
now,
the
last
important
benefit
directly
from
the
gn
and
np
merger
is
this,
this
was
saved
about
$40
million
a
year.
now,
will
that
go
to
the
shippers?
we
know
it
will
go
to
the
shippers
for
justice
reason.
the
railroads
in
the
last
18
months
that
had
thee
separate
rate
increases
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
3%,
5%
then
10
days
ago
just
10
days
ago
they
asked
another
6%
all
based
on
added
cost
of
operation.
as
shipper’s
we
know
the
only
way
that
we
can
get
rates
down
or
not
hold
them
down,
not
let
them
get
down
but
just
hold
them
from
going
out
of
the
moon
is
to
get
lower
cost
of
operation.
this
merger
will
save
$40
million
a
year
and
coincidentally
that
would
be
just
about
the
equivalent
of
6%
that’s
before
the
commission
today
for
rate
increase.
it’s
that
important
to
the
shipping
public.
now,
beyond
those
tremendous
benefits
before
the
gn
and
np
merger,
what
do
we
get
as
added
benefits
it’s
because
we
get
new
milwaukee
railroad
and
we
do
get
a
new
milwaukee.
we
get
a
revitalized
east-west
railroad
with
the
ability
to
take
long
hauls
instead
of
being
cut-off
at
the
pocket
at
st.
paul.
now,
they
have
to
give
all
traffic
to
the
gn
and
np
at
st.
paul.
now,
they’ll
be
able
to
haul
it,
clear
out
as
far
west
to
seattle
and
spokane.
we’ll
get
a
new
north-south
railroad
because
we
have
no
milwaukee
connection
south
of
longview
to
dayville
go
into
portland
and
we’ll
have
a
brand
new
competitive
line
there.
we’ll
have
a
new
canadian
railroad
with
high
speed
service
to
in
and
from
the
sumas
area.
we’ll
have
another
railroad
in
billings,
the
milwaukee.
in
the
bellingham
area,
we
will
have
a
vastly
improved
service
there.
fast
industrial
lands
and
properties
on
the
milwaukee
that
no
sensible
industry
could
locate
on
because
of
their
absence
of
proper
rates
and
routes
because
of
their
limited
coverage
and
other
deficiencies
will
be
opened
for
industrial
development
and
beyond
all
of
that,
this
should
make
such
a
substantial
improvement
in
the
revenue
position
of
the
milwaukee
railroad
that
they
will
be
a
vital
competitor
even
better
than
they
are
today.
now,
after
the
merger,
those
are
the
benefits
of
the
milwaukee.
are
we
going
to
be
left
then
with
the
withdrawal
of
the
gn
competition
with
something
of
a
vacuum
of
competition?
to
me,
it’s
unbelievable
that
such
insertion
could
be
made
to
the
court
here
and
to
the
courts
below
and
to
the
commission.
for
example,
the
union
pacific,
the
union
pacific
will
handle
over
100,000
cars
of
loaded
freight
through
the
huntington,
oregon
gateway
to
and
from
the
pacific
northwest.
if
that’s
with
competition
it’s
certainly
not
the
adjective
that
shippers
would
use.
after
the
merger,
the
great
northern
pacific
merger
of
the
up
holding
just
the
business
they
have
today
would
handle
still
about
25%
of
the
business
of
the
north-west.
we’ll
have
the
strengthened
milwaukee.
the
sp
will
handle
42%
of
the
business
out
of
the
state
of
oregon.
now,
those
tremendous
it
says
from
the
competitive
railroads
that
will
exist
plus
the
cpr-soo
are
a
vital
importance
to
--
or
a
vital
importance
to
us
in
giving
us
competition
for
the
future.
beyond
that,
we
will
have
transcontinental
truck
lines,
eight
new
ones
since
this
case
was
filed.
we
have
exempt
trucks.
we
have
a
vast
amount
of
trucking
covering
everything
from
lowest
rated
to
high
rated
traffic.
now,
the
last
important
--
the
last
major
point
i
would
like
to
make
is,
what
safeguards
has
the
interstate
commerce
commission
built-in
to
their
order
that
will
protect
us
from
great
discriminations
and
service
discriminations
if
this
court
approves
that
order?
the
most
important
thing
is
this.
the
long
and
short
of
provisions
of
section
4
of
the
act
will
prevent
any
competitive
or
totally
non-competitive
point
from
being
charged
more
than
the
next
beyond
the
point.
that
makes
with
236
competitive
points
on
this
railroad
that
would
give
a
fantastic
amount
of
long
and
short
to
a
rate
protection
that
is
iron
clad
and
is
not
waived
anywhere
in
this
order.
we’ll
have
rate
protection
because
the
competitive
rates
will
serve
at
the
maximum
at
any
intermediate
point.
beyond
that,
we
have
the
ability
to
short
hold
the
gn
and
np
by
giving
the
traffic
to
the
milwaukee.
for
example,
in
the
columbia
basin
if
they
would
not
give
proper
car
supply
we
could
take
the
gn
and
np
and
turn
the
traffic
over
to
the
milwaukee
at
spoken
to
take
on
to
chicago.
we
will
have
at
least
eight
other
routes
such
as
the
western
pacific
the
sewer
line
route,
the
rates
by
the
cpr-soo,
the
rates
via
the
union
pacific
and
those
via
the
western
pacific.
beyond
that,
the
commission
has
even
gone
this
far.
they
have
given
us
at
five
years
safety
valve,
any
of
us,
the
shipper
or
injured
railroad
or
other
injured
party
can
come
back
to
this
commission
any
time
within
five
years
and
say
we
have
been
treated
unfairly,
we
need
help
and
the
commission
is
holding
this
record
open
to
take
care
of
that.
then
the
last
thing
is
our
own
state
commissions
who
do
not
oppose
this
merger
now
will
be
able
to
bring
their
best
influences
to
bear.
now,
in
inclusion
i
would
like
to
say
this,
there
is
no
labor
opposition
before
this
court
today.
there
is
no
state
opposition
here.
the
department
of
agriculture
supports
the
merger
and
the
department
of
defense
does
not
oppose
it.
no
shipper
opposition,
no
chamber
port
or
other
group
is
here
opposing
this
merger.
the
icc
obviously
supports
it
not
one
railroad
is
here
contesting
this
for
all
of
those
reasons,
we
respectfully
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
and
allow
the
merger
to
proceed
forthwith.
thank
you
very
much.
