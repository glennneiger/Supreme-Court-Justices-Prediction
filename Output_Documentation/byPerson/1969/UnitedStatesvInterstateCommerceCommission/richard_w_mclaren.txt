mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
will
direct
my
argument
to
case
number
28,
the
united
states,
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
this
is
a
civil
case
which
comes
to
the
court
on
direct
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
a
three-judge
district
court.
the
district
court
denied
the
government's
request
for
an
injunction
and
upheld
the
icc's
approval
of
the
merger
of
the
great
northern
and
the
northern
pacific
railroads
which
have
been
referred
to
in
our
briefs
as
the
northern
lines
and
their
various
railroads
subsidiaries.
the
merger
has
been
stayed
by
this
court's
order.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
icc
correctly
applied
the
public
interest
test
of
section
5
(2)
(b)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
when
it
approved
this
merger,
holding
that
the
savings
and
service
benefits
of
the
merger
outweigh
the
elimination
of
substantial
rail
competition
between
the
northern
lines
in
the
northern
tier
of
western
states.
case
number
43,
the
city
of
auburn
case
is
related
to
our
case
and
that
it
also
raises
competitive
issues.
the
other
two
cases,
the
case
number
38,
the
brundage
case
involving
the
fairness
of
the
merger
terms
to
northern
pacific
stockholders
and
number
44,
the
livingston
case,
questioning
the
northern
pacific's
title
to
its
properties
raised
on
related
issues.
now,
although
the
record
in
this
case
is
a
very
long
one,
the
basic
facts
are
relatively
simple.
first,
i
would
like
to
identify
the
roads
which
proposed
to
merge
in
terms
of
the
areas
they
serve.
the
trunk
lines
of
the
merger
parties
are
shown
in
various
colors
on
the
fold
out
map
at
the
end
of
the
great
northern's
brief.
i've
taken
the
liberty
of
requesting
the
clerk
to
distribute
to
each
member
of
the
court
an
extra
copy
of
this
map
and
also
of
a
copy
of
the
map
which
is
prepared
from
exhibit
85
and
used
by
the
government
in
the
district
court
proceeding.
the
latter
shows
the
applicant
roads
as
they
will
appear
of
--
when
it
--
if
merged.
looking
first
at
the
great
northern's
map,
the
bigger
one,
you
will
see
that
the
great
northern
trunk
line
toward
the
top
in
red.
with
its
affiliates,
great
northern
carries
on
operations
over
some
80
-
200
miles
of
road
in
the
northern
tier
states
from
minneapolis
and
duluth,
duluth
from
the
east
to
spokane,
seattle,
portland
and
other
terminals
in
the
pacific
northwest.
northern
pacific,
in
green
on
the
map
and
its
affiliates
operate
over
some
6800
miles
of
road
somewhat
south
of
the
great
northern
and
they
serve
the
same
main
terminals
as
the
great
northern
in
minnesota
and
in
the
pacific
northwest.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
the
great
northern
map
your
honor
shows
that
the
trunk
lines
and
in
colors
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
yes,
your
honor
and
the
lighter
black
lines
show
more
or
less
branch
lines.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
they
are
on
that
particular
case,
yes
mr.
justice
stewart.
some
of
the
other
black
lines
shown
as
i
understand
belong
to
a
various
other
roads.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
shown
on
the
government's
map,
the
smaller
one
in
red
are
all
of
the
routes
as
they
will
appear
of
the
merged
roads
both
the
trunk
lines
and
branches.
the
chicago,
burlington
and
quincy,
a
road
that's
jointly
owned
by
the
northern
lines
is
shown
--
its
main
road
is
shown
in
brown
on
the
big
fold
out
map.
burlington
conducts
operations
over
some
8600
miles
of
road
running
northwest
from
chicago
and
minneapolis
and
also
west
from
chicago
to
serve
such
points
to
st.
luis
and
kansas
city,
omaha,
denver,
billings,
montana
and
with
the
connection
with
northern
pacific
in
montana.
subsidiaries
of
the
burlington
goes
out
as
far
as
the
texas
gulf
coast
as
is
shown
on
the
government
map
and
as
the
great
northern
map
shows,
i
think
the
burlington
service
tends
to
be
complimentary
to
rather
than
competitive
with
the
service
of
the
northern
lines.
also
involved
in
the
merger
is
the
spokane,
portland
and
seattle
railroad
about
600
miles
of
road
shown
in
blue
and
its
main
route
on
the
great
northern
map.
it
is
also
jointly
owned
by
the
northern
lines
and
its
mean
line
and
provides
their
shortest
route
from
spokane
down
to
portland.
the
third
line,
third
rail
line
providing
service
across
the
northern
tier
states
is
the
milwaukee
railroad
as
shown
in
black
on
the
government's
map
and
also
on
the
great
northern's.
now,
there's
no
dispute
that
the
northern
lines
are
financially
strong
firms.
they
owned
vast
acreage
of
valuable
land
and
mineral
rights
as
well
as
rail
and
motor
carrier
assets.
there
are
also
regularly
profitable
although
it's
fair
to
say
that
their
profits
have
fluctuated
over
the
years
and
do
not
reflect
a
large
percentage
return
on
their
invested
capital.
as
merged,
the
northern
lines
and
the
burlington
would
constitute
one
of
the
largest
rail
systems
in
the
country.
the
merged
company
would
have
some
27,000
miles
of
track
in
16
states,
total
assets
around
$3
billion,
annual
rail
revenues,
$823
million
and
net
income
in
the
neighborhood
of
$131
million
a
year.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
believe
mr.
justice
harlan
that
in
trackage
it
is
bigger,
in
terms
of
revenue,
it
is
not
as
big.
i'm
not
positive
of
those
figures.
as
the
maps
tend
to
indicate,
the
northern
lines
are
head
to
head
competitors
for
traffic
across
the
northern
tier
states.
each
is
the
main
competitor
of
the
other
and
the
milwaukee
is
a
very
weak
third.
the
nature
and
the
extent
of
this
competition,
rail
competition,
and
the
intermodal
competition
in
this
area
is
covered
by
the
findings
in
the
icc
reports
as
i'll
describe
in
just
a
moment.
to
summarize
the
proceedings
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
there
are
two
main
reports.
the
first,
disapproved
the
merger
on
grounds
that
it
would
have
a
drastically
adverse
effect
on
competition
as
well
as
the
adverse
effects
on
employees.
the
second
report
on
reconsideration
reversed
and
it
approved
the
merger.
i
should
say
that
the
findings
of
fact
in
the
first
report
are
of
significance
since
they
are
largely
found
again
in
the
second
report
which
is
based
on
substantially
the
same
record.
there
are
few
exceptions,
as
i
will
point
out.
i
also
think
that
the
rational
of
the
first
report
is
important
since
it's
our
contention
that
it
applied
the
correct
legal
standard
whereas
the
second
report
did
not.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
now
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
mr.
chief
justice
burger
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
believe
that
the
figures
that
your
honor
is
recalling
has
to
do
with
approximately
6%
that
points
where
the
northern
lines
are
the
only
rail
service.
i
believe
that
there
is
another
figure
of
some
on
37%
or
38%
where
they
compete
for
revenues
and
there
all
--
is
also
some
other
competition.
and
the
broad
figure
that
we
use
and
that
i
will
get
into
in
some
further
detail
a
little
bit
later
is
that
the
northern
lines
directly
compete
for
around
43%
of
their
revenue.
they
--
and
there's
an
additional
overhead
portion
of
their
revenue,
a
12%.
so,
we're
contending
that
they
are
competitors
for
about
55%
of
their
revenue.
there
are
some
other
figures
as
to
the
percentage
of
the
market
they
have
which
i
will
get
to.
it
runs
to
60%,
70%
and
80%
in
different
areas.
to
review
just
briefly,
the
proceedings
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission;
they
began
in
1961
when
the
applicant's
petition
for
authority
to
merge.
public
hearings
were
held
in
1961
and
1962
in
which
the
justice
department
participated
and
in
1964,
the
examiner
issued
a
report
recommending
the
merger
with
certain
conditions
be
approved.
the
matter
was
then
briefed
and
argued
before
the
icc
and
in
1966,
icc
issued
its
first
report
disapproving
the
merger
even
if
conditioned
as
demanded
by
various
interveners,
including
various
other
affected
railroads.
now,
in
the
course
to
this
first
report,
the
commission
analyzed
the
evidence
of
the
estimated
savings
to
the
applicants
in
merger
which
it
estimated
around
twenty
two
and
a
half
million
dollars
a
year
after
10
years.
the
report
detailed
and
analyzed
the
various
efficiencies,
principally
the
combining
of
yards
and
other
facilities
and
the
reduction
of
work
forces
and
the
report
listed
also
the
advantage
to
shippers,
principally
more
direct
routing
and
faster
schedules
all
of
which
the
merger
promised.
on
the
other
hand,
the
report
noted
that
applicants
could
coordinate
certain
facilities
and
realize
very
substantial
savings
without
merger.
it
pointed
out
that
the
applicants
are
“large,
strong
and
prosperous
railroads
and
growing
strong.”
it
also
found
that
their
long-term
train
was
favorable
as
against
motor
carriers.
it
found
that
ton
miles
of
freight
had
increase
substantially
during
the
1960
through
1964
period
and
it
found
that
the
railroads
had
what
it
called
a
decided
competitive
advantage
in
many
long
haul
of
movements.
now,
in
approaching
the
public
interest
test
laid
down
by
section
5
(2)
of
the
commerce
act,
the
commission
saw
its
task
as
one
of
determining
whether
the
adverse
effects
of
the
merger
upon
competition
and
on
carry
employees
were
outweighed
by
cost
savings
to
applicants
and
the
improved
service
to
shippers.
it
saw
the
public
interest
scale
as
being
imbalanced,
tipped
neither
for
nor
against
the
merger
under
the
law.
analyzing
the
competitive
effects
of
the
merger,
the
commission
focused
on
the
northern
tier
states
as
being
the
area
in
which
a
low
cost
rail
transportation
was
as
it
said
of
primary
importance
to
long-haul,
raw
material
shippers
in
the
area
where
rail
competition
would
be
most
adversely
affected
by
the
merger.
the
report
also
found
that
whereas
animal,
mineral,
agricultural
and
forest
products
account
for
around
60%
of
northern
lines'
revenues,
this
kind
of
traffic
was
generally
not
attractive
to
motor
carriers
and
was
not
highly
susceptible
to
diversion
to
motor
carriers.
in
fact,
it
found
that
intermodal
competition
is
not
as
strong
in
the
northern
states
here
as
in
other
parts
of
the
country.
the
report
also
found
that
the
northern
lines
were
in
direct
and
substantial
competition
with
one
another
and
then
when
this
was
eliminated,
the
merged
road
would
have
a
dominant
position
in
the
northern
tier
states.
for
example,
it
found
that
together
the
northern
lines
would
handle
61%
of
the
carload
traffic
moving
westbound
in
the
northern
tier
and
83%
eastbound.
as
to
west
coast
traffic
from
washington
to
california,
it
would
have
73.5%
moving
north
and
south
through
the
seista
and
beaver
gateways
and
that
it
would
move
67%
of
ton
10
miles
of
rail
freight
in
the
northern
tier
states;
45%
minnesota,
81%
north
dakota,
82%
in
montana
and
77%
in
washington.
after
the
merger,
the
first
report
found
that
northern
lines
would
as
the
report
said,
reign
supreme.
they
would
overshadow
all
their
rail
competitors
within
this
region
and
from
this
region
to
points
beyond.
measuring
the
competition
that
would
be
eliminated,
icc
found
that
the
northern
lines
were
in
direct
competition
as
i
mentioned
at
points
accounting
for
43%
of
their
revenues
and
further
that
they
competed
for
overhead
traffic
accounting
for
another
12%,
thus
the
merger
would
eliminate
the
competition
between
them
for
55%
of
their
total
revenues.
as
to
the
milwaukee
road,
the
icc
found
that
for
various
reasons,
it
was
a
handicap
and
weak
competitor.
it
accounted
for
only
12%
of
east-west
traffic
in
the
northern
tier.
the
first
report
recognized
that
the
milwaukee
could
be
strengthen
by
conditions
attached
to
the
merger
and
it
considered
these
conditions
principally,
the
granting
of
trackage
rights
into
portland,
oregon
and
into
billings,
montana
and
the
opening
of
11
gateways
where
it
could
exchange
traffic
with
northern
lines.
but
the
report
found
even
with
these
conditions,
the
benefits
would
be
as
it
said
minimum
and
milwaukee's
relative
competitive
position
after
the
merger
would
be
weaker
than
ever.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
believe
that
the
examiner's
report
denied
most
of
them,
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
then
the
--
in
the
first
report,
the
commission
took
it
assuming
as
i
understand
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
assuming
all
of
them,
yes
and
saying
that
even
though
they
had
all
these
gateways
and
the
new
terminal
on
the
coast
at
portland,
they
still
would
be
relatively
weaker.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
report
went
on
to
point
out
that
the
new
company
would
have
what
it
referred
to
as
tremendous
solicitation
advantages.
the
merged
company
would
and
it
noted
that
the
milwaukee's
solicitation
efforts
would
be
puny
by
comparison.
and
this
is
important
because
when
you
open
gateways,
this
is
a
two-way
street,
the
other
fellow
can
get
traffic
as
well
and
the
milwaukee
could
lose
as
well
as
to
gain
traffic.
now,
the
first
report
concluded
by
holding
that
applicants
had
failed
to
establish
that
the
--
that
the
merger
would
result
in
transportation
service
superior
to
that
which
could
be
provided
without
merger
and
indeed
“the
disadvantages
of
an
appropriately
conditioned
merger,
and
drastic
lessening
of
competition
and
adverse
effects
on
carrier
employees
outweigh
the
benefits
that
might
be
derived
by
applicants
in
the
shipping
public.”
now,
there
is
a
dissent
to
this
first
report.
five
commissioners
dissented
and
they
did
so
not
on
the
theory
that
the
northern
pacific
and
great
northern
are
less
dominant
then
the
majority
found,
but
on
the
theory
that
they
are
indolent
giants
who
do
not
now
bother
to
compete.
they
said
that
the
northern
lines
in
their
language
are
fat
and
happy.
they
split
the
lion's
share
of
the
northern
transcontinental
traffic
and
revenues
between
them
and
so
preserve
a
facade
of
competition.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
the
dissent
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
yes
mr.
justice
harlan,
and
six
on
majority,
it's
a
6
to
5
vote.
the
dissent
also
found
that
the
northern
lines
have
what
they
called
a
common
law
marriage
and
they
said
that
they
hold
shippers
captive
over
great
distances
with
a
virtual
lock
on
traffic
routed
through
spokane
and
the
twin
cities.
that
they
have
hamstrung
and
short-hauled
the
milwaukee
and
that
they've
condemned
it
to
a
marginal
and
steadily
deteriorating
existence.
the
dissent
concluded
that
what
was
really
needed
here
was
to
write
off
the
present
family
competition
as
it
called
it
by
using
the
conditioning
power
of
section
5
to
try
to
establish
the
milwaukee
as
a
genuine
and
authentic
competitor.
now,
i
emphasize
this
dissent
because
upon
reconsideration
as
i'll
describe
in
a
moment,
the
commission
reversed
itself
and
it
approved
the
merger
and
the
minority
became
the
majority
in
the
second
report
and
it
used
some
of
the
same
language
in
reasoning
as
in
the
dissent
some
of
which
i
have
just
read.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
mr.
justice
harlan
there
was
a
change
in
some
people
on
the
commission.
the
new
lineup
was
eight
to
two
and
one
abstaining.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
think
two
must
have
shifted
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
no,
it's
not
a
question
entirely,
the
question
is
very
sound.
there
were
two
or
three,
two
that
shifted.
well,
after
the
first
report
was
issued
in
december
1966,
the
applicants
petitioned
the
icc
for
reconsideration.
they
formally
stated
that
they
were
willing
to
accept
various
conditions
including
all
those
asked
for
by
the
milwaukee
and
the
chicago
northwestern
railroads.
at
the
same
time,
applicants
said
it
into
an
agreement
with
those
two
roads,
the
milwaukee
and
the
chicago
northwestern
not
to
oppose
their
proposed
merger
in
return
for
which
the
milwaukee
and
chicago
northwestern
agreed
to
withdraw
their
opposition
and
support
the
northern
lines'
merger.
the
applicants
also
filed
their
agreement
to
enter
into
attrition
agreements
for
the
benefit
of
employees
and
they
urged
that
icc
had
erred
in
estimating
merger
savings
in
the
first
report
and
that
these
would
be
substantially
greater
and
that
it
had
found
and
that
it
asked
for
further
evidence
to
be
heard
on
this
subject.
in
january
1967,
the
commission
granted
the
petition.
they
issued
an
order,
reopening
the
proceedings
and
as
the
latter
report
stated,
this
was
a
limited
reopening.
the
further
hearing
was
limited
solely
to
determining
and
the
basis
of
the
most
current
information
readily
available,
the
amount
of
estimated
savings
resulting
from
the
proposed
merger
in
the
light
of
one,
agreements
entered
into
between
the
applicants
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other,
the
milwaukee
and
the
northwestern
and
second,
the
effect
of
relevant
financial,
operational
and
another
changes
related
to
savings
which
have
occurred
subsequently
to
the
close
of
hearing
recon
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
the
personnel
did
change
mr.
justice
black.
i
believe
that
in
the
second
report,
there
were
eight
in
the
majority
and
this
included
five
that
had
been
in
the
majority
before
plus
two
that
had
changed
and
plus
one
new
commissioner.
there
were
two
that
still
were
dissenting
and
then
there
was
one
new
commissioner
who
did
not
participate.
i
believe
that
was
the
lineup.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
there
was
one
new
commissioner
who
did
not,
there
were
two
who
did.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
no,
there
were
five
in
the
original
dissent.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
believe
i'm
right
in
thinking
that
there
were
three
different
commissioners.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i'm
sorry
sir,
i
don't
have
that
information,
i
could
get
it.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
think
that
that's
right
mr.
chief
justice
that
that
were
two
from
the
former
majority
that
switched
and
then
one
new
commissioner
that
added
to
the
original
five
maybe
eight
and
there
was
one
new
commissioner
who
didn't
participate.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
that
would
do
it,
yes,
because
they
had
five
and
they
did
get
the
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
they
did
get
the
majority
from
--
by
one
of
the
commissioners.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
really
can't
speak
on
that
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
the
basic
fact
here
is
that
there
was
a
change
in
the
standard
that
they
applied.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
see,
they're
seven
or
eight
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
that's
right.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
eight
to
two
and
one
abstained.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
out
if
the
majority?
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
our
basic
contention
mr.
justice
harlan
is
that
the
commission
failed
on
the
second
report
to
apply
a
public
need
standard
which
is
the
basic
issue
that
was
presented
to
the
court.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
it's
a
very
difficult
question
mr.
justice
black
because
the
court
has
laid
out
the
requirement
for
an
accommodation
of
the
transportation
act,
the
organization
of
roads
into
systems
in
and
to
serving
the
needs
and
requirements
of
efficient
transportation.
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
has
held
that
we
do
have
a
national
policy
favoring
competition
and
that
the
cases
say
that
the
commission
in
approaching
this
merger
cases
must
accommodate
the
views
and
the
policies
of
these
two
statutes
in
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
by
--
not
among
the
same
identical
parties,
but
i
think
mr.
justice
black
and
you
have
for
example
in
your
penn
central
merger,
a
situation
where
the
roads
merged
and
the
commission
had
in
mind
the
remaining
competition
from
the
norfolk
and
western
road
and
from
the
chesapeake
in
ohio
system
that
was
coming
along.
it
looked
at
the
fact
that
you
have
a
network
of
good
roads
and
strong
intermodal
competition
and
then
it
found
a
public
interest
factor
here
in
that
the
roads
had
the
burden
of
providing
public
service
through
commutation
in
cities
and
if
they
had
the
very
puzzling
and
difficult
problem
of
what
to
do
with
the
bankrupt
new
haven
railroad.
and
the
in-balance,
all
parties
felt
in
the
penn
central
litigation
that
that
merger
was
a
good
thing
and
when
it
came
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
that's
very
true.
and
the
matter
did
not
come
to
the
court
although
it
came
to
the
court
on
other
issues,
it
did
not
come
up
on
the
competitive
question.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
didn't
understand
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
we're
opposing
it
on
the
theory
mr.
justice
black
that
if
you
have
healthy
directly
competing
railroads,
they
do
not
need
this
merger
in
order
to
continue
to
give
good
service.
they
are
dominant
in
this
area
of
the
northern
tier
states.
and
we
think
that
under
those
conditions,
the
requirement
of
accommodation
of
the
policy
of
the
transportation
act
and
of
the
anti-trust
laws
required
the
thing
--
that
such
an
act
a
competitive
merger
not
be
permitted
unless
they're
--
it
serves
a
real
public
need
and
that
that
kind
of
elimination
of
competition
should
not
be
permitted
merely
to
serve
the
private
interest
of
the
parties.
and
if
there
are
public
interests
that
are
being
saved
--
served
by
the
merger,
but
if
they
could
be
served
by
a
less
anti
competitive
alternative
then
the
merger
should
not
be
permitted.
the
lesser
competitive
alternatives
should
be
put
into
effect
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
after
all
under
the
law
is
given
vast
powers,
and
great
discretion
to
regulate
and
to
supervise
the
affairs
of
the
railroad.
and
in
this
case,
it's
our
contention
that
the
commerce
commission
should
have
considered
to
what
extent
it
could
have
opened
up
the
gateways
in
order
to
strengthen
the
milwaukee
if
that
was
the
matter
of
public
interest
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
certainly,
if
an
area
has
inadequate
service
and
the
way
to
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
--
get
out
of
it
is
to
have
a
merger.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
--
that
would
be
one,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
no.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
no,
i
don't
think
that's
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
don't
think
that's
true.
we
don't
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
better
service
might
be
enough
but
if
it's
terribly
anticompetitive
merger,
if
the
better
service
can
be
achieved
by
a
less
anti
competitive
alternative
then
the
merger
should
not
be
permitted
unless
there
is
some
real
public
need
for
it.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
that's
one
of
the
things,
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
they
did
that
in
the
first
report.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
i
think
if
they
found
--
made
that
finding
and
that
the
--
there
was
a
need
of
public
service
resulting
from
this,
i
think
that
they
would
have
that
power.
i'm
not
sure
that
we
wouldn't
be
here
because
i
think
that
then
the
court
has
a
right
to
look
at
the
situation
and
see
if
the
--
if
that
determination
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
and
i
seriously
question
in
this
particular
case
that
the
commission
has
done
more
than
really
give
lip
service
to
the
question
of
the
value
of
competition.
they
have
followed
the
dissent,
the
point
i
made
a
little
earlier
that
after
all
these
giants
have
not
competed
for
years,
they
have
thrown
up
their
hands,
given
up
hope
and
they
have
said,
“well,
let's
let
them
merge
and
we'll
try
and
make
something
out
of
the
milwaukee
and
maybe
it
will
provide
the
competition
that
we
can't
get
from
the
northern
lines.”
well,
on
the
second
report,
the
commission
came
out
and
they
said
that
this
is
a
matter
where
we
--
where
an
error
of
the
savings
that
will
come
from
the
merger,
there
will
be
some
$39
million
of
savings
after
few
years
instead
of
the
$22
million
or
$25
million
earlier
estimated
and
they
dwelt
at
some
length
on
the
improved
service
which
was
estimated
would
result
from
the
merger.
but,
they
did
say
no
prospective
service
benefits
that
had
not
been
considered
in
the
first
report.
and
i
think
what's
fair
to
say
that
what
they
did
do
on
the
second
report
was
to
discard
or
reverse
two
principles
of
analysis
which
had
been
followed
by
a
majority
in
the
first
report.
they
took
a
new
perspective
as
they
say.
first,
they
determined
to
focus
not
so
much
on
competitive
effects
in
the
northern
tier
states
where
competition
would
be
eliminated,
but
rather
they
broadened
out
the
focus.
and
they
took
the
broad
view
of
the
total
area
that
was
served
by
all
of
the
merger
parties,
including
that
down
in
the
central
corridor
which
is
served
by
the
burlington.
and
of
course
the
effect
on
competition
looked
somewhat
less
drastic
taking
that
view.
second,
in
considering
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
the
merger,
the
commission
determined
the
primary
weigh
not
be
given
to
the
competition
eliminated,
that
is
the
competition
for
55%
of
their
revenue
because
it
held
that
the
--
there
was
substantial
intermodal
as
well
as
intramodal
competition
that
that
would
survive
the
merger.
on
this
basis,
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
that
was
argued
in
the
lower
court
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
think
that
they
are
kind
of
on
both
sides
of
that
question.
there
was
from
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
yes
sir.
there
was
an
indication
that
in
the
first
report
that
there
is
a
presumption
in
favor
of
mergers.
on
the
other
hand,
there
was
a
statement
that
the
matter
is
in
balance
and
then
the
same
thing
in
effect
was
said
in
the
second
report.
it
does
appear
to
us
that
they
in
effect
did
accept
the
idea
that
there's
a
presumption
in
favor
of
mergers
that
are
brought
up
by
the
private
parties
in
the
second
report
whereas
they
gave
competition,
a
certain
value
and
weight
in
the
first
report
that
they
didn't
in
the
second
report.
but
there,
the
difficulty
as
they
pointed
out
in
the
first
report,
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that
you
have
the
difficult
task
of
weighing
an
intangible
value
of
competition.
on
the
one
hand
against
the
savings
from
merger
the
tangible
values
that
you
can
say,
well,
it's
$25
million
a
year
and
how
do
you
say
whether
competition
is
worth
$25
million
a
year?
i
think
that
there
is
some
indication
in
the
recent
holdings
of
the
court
that
starting
with
mclean
where
this
test
was
laid
out
that
there
must
be
the
accommodation.
the
commission
must
consider
on
the
one
hand
the
anticompetitive
consequences
on
the
other,
the
savings,
the
improvements
in
service
and
so
on.
that
was
spelled
out
first
in
mclean,
it
was
followed
in
the
denver,
it
was
followed
in
the
st.
louis
--
minneapolis
st.
louis
case
and
it
has
been
referred
to
at
various
times
since
then.
i
think
that
two
or
three
of
the
court's
more
recent
cases
have
cast
some
additional
light
on
this
in
the
sense
that
the
court
has
treated
competition
as
the
basic
policy
and
it
has
treated
the
power
of
the
administrative
agency
to
grant
immunity
from
that
as
carrying
a
rather
important
determination
that
is
to
be
made
by
the
administrative
agency
and
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
svenska
is
one
them,
the
denver
rio
grand
case
i
think
is
one
of
them.
that's
the
railroad
express
agency
stock
purchase
and
in
the
denver
rio
grand
opinion,
there's
a
passage
that
has
to
do
and
it
points
out
that
this
five
to
power
is
the
power
to
grant
immunity
from
the
policy
which
favors
the
competition.
and
it
implies
that
this
is
a
matter
of
considerable
importance
for
the
commission
to
determine.
and
i
think
that
when
you
then
get
to
the
svenska
case,
and
two,
that
was
a
maritime
case
and
two,
it
was
not
a
merger
case,
but
it
did
specifically
mentioned
two
of
the
rail
merger
cases
and
it
said
that
those
cases
follow
the
same
pattern.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
yes,
yes
it
certainly
is
mr.
chief
justice,
but
our
point
on
that
is
that
the
original
figures
came
out
and
i
don't
remember
them
precisely,
but
i
think
the
rail
time
from
the
northwest
down
into
the
chicago
area
was
something
like
94
hours
and
they
said,
when
we
merge
we
can
put
together
better,
more
direct
runs
and
we
can
cut
12
hours
off
of
that.
but
before
the
record
was
closed
because
the
milwaukee
had
put
through
some
faster
trains,
they'd
cut
more
than
12
hours
off
already.
they
took
some
lighter
weight
equipment
and
they
were
more
careful
in
their
scheduling
and
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
them,
if
your
honor
please,
to
work
out
these
better
routings
without
merger.
they
don't
have
to
merge
these
railroads
in
order
to
get
direct
routings
and
that's
what
the
minority,
what
the
dissent
in
the
first
report
was
pointing
to.
they
have
sat
here
fat
and
happy
they've
been
entirely
unwilling
to
take
advantage
of
the
possibilities
that
they
were
for
more
direct
routings
to
try
and
meet
the
truck
competition
that
the
other
side
talks
about.
they
could've
done
that,
they
don't
have
to
merge
to
do
it,
and
they
could
cut
very,
very
substantial
time
of
the
run
from
the
west
down
into
the
markets
where
they
need
to
market
these
products
from
the
raw
materials
country.
referring
once
again
to
the
svenska
case,
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
the
--
the
--
this
came
up
on
the
maritime
commissions
power
which
is
comparable
to
the
commission's
power
to
grant
immunity
to
an
anticompetitive
arrangement
and
there
i
think
it
was
an
exclusive
dealing
arrangement
and
referring
to
the
question
of
the
national
economic
policy,
the
court
pointed
out
that
another
lies
illegal
arrangement
and
as
the
court
said,
“alone,
will
normally
constitute
substantial
evidence
that
the
agreement
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
unless
other
evidence
fairly
detracts
from
the
weight
of
this
factor.”
now,
we
contend
that
the
maritime
commission
rule
that
was
discussed
and
upheld
in
svenska
precisely
describes
the
standard
which
governs
here.
fmc's
rule
put
the
burden
on
the
proponent
of
the
anticompetitive
agreement
just
as
we
would
put
the
burden
on
the
applicants
to
merge,
to
demonstrate
that
it
was
required
by
a
serious
transportation
need,
necessary
to
secure
important
public
benefits
for
--
in
furtherance
of
a
valid
regulatory
purpose.
and
the
court
not
only
upheld
the
svenska
--
fmc
rule,
but
it
stated
that
the
standard
was
“in
full
accord
with
the
kind
of
accommodation
between
anti-trust
and
regulatory
objectives
approved
by
this
court
in
the
seaboard
airline
in
minneapolis
st.
paul
rail
merger
decisions.”
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
that
the
--
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
that
in
the
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
in
the
first
report,
i
think
that
the
commission
majority
followed
the
standard
that
i
have
just
described.
they
gave
some
real
weight
not
just
lip
service
to
the
value
of
competition.
they
considered
the
possibility
that
the
advantages
of
the
merger
could
be
achieved
by
less
competitive
means.
and
then
they
looked
at
what
was
left
over
that
would
just
be
accomplished
by
merger
and
they
said,
“that
isn't
enough
because
on
the
other
hand
you'd
eliminate
all
this
competition
and
virtually
create
a
rail
monopoly
in
this
northern
tier
states.”
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
and
our
view
is
that
it
being
--
the
second
report
being
in
effect
took
the
savings
claimed
by
the
carriers
and
they
looked
at
the
better
service
that
would
be
given
and
they
threw
up
their
hands
as
far
as
their
actual
powers
to
regulate
and
to
force
competition
and
to
give
the
milwaukee
a
viable
position
in
this
market.
and
they
said,
“okay,
let
them
merge,
we'll
try
and
work
out
conditions
that
will
make
the
milwaukee
for
the
first
time
give
shippers
in
the
area,
for
the
first
time
a
realistic
choice
of
carriers.”
i
believe
it
was
somewhat
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
don't
think
that
in
the
second
report,
they
really
gave
value
to
the
question
of
competition
nor
did
they
bear
on
the
question
of
the
public
need
for
the
thing.
in
other
words,
there
is
--
there
must
first
be
a
public
benefit
from
it.
secondly,
there
must
be
a
need
for
it
and
there
isn't
a
need
for
it
if
it
can
be
done
by
a
less
drastic
means.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
that's
the
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
and
that's
the
test
for
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
don't
think
i
can
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
fine.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
think
that
you
can
tell
in
the
first
report
in
the
final
paragraph
where
they
had
said
that
the
proponents
of
the
merger
have
failed
to
carry
their
burden
of
establishing
this
and
they
point
to
the
fact
that
there
are
less
drastic
alternatives.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
165
and
166,
i
believe
your
honor.
on
page
166,
they
point
out
that
the
--
to
find
competition
is
not
worth
between
12
and
25
million
a
year
less
expenditures
to
achieve
those
savings
would
be
tantamount
to
a
conclusion
that
the
value
of
intramodal
rail
competition
is
negligible.
and
they
mentioned
this
tangible
savings
factor
but
they
have
said
that
they
were
convinced
that
they
are
not
as
great
as
the
value
of
competition
and
they
conclude
that
the
disadvantages
of
the
appropriately
conditioned
merger,
the
drastic
lessening
of
competition
and
adverse
effect
on
carrier
employees
outweigh
the
benefits
that
might
be
derive
by
applicants
and
the
shipping
public.
and
i
think
the
standard
follows
there
in
the
top
of
167,
applicants
have
failed
to
show
that
their
proposed
merger
would
result
in
transportation
service
to
the
public
that
is
superior
to
that
which
can
be
provided
without
merger
or
that
the
benefits
reasonably
attributable
to
the
proposed
merger
outweigh
the
adverse
effects
of
the
merger
on
carrier
employees
and
the
benefits
that
shippers
derived
from
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
i
just
don't
read
it
that
way
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
seems
to
me
that
they
abandoned
the
possibility
that
the
commission
has
this
broad
power
to
bring
about
the
better
service
that
is
anticipated
here
and
then
what
you
left,
have
left
in
this
merger
is
really
private
benefits.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
the
second
time,
i
think
they
really
followed
what
the
dissent
had
talked
about
that
they
were
going
to
strengthen
the
milwaukee
and
they
said
in
the
second
report
on
reconsideration
which
comes
a
good
bit
later
in
another
volume,
they
said
that
the
milwaukee
conditions
are
a
necessary
predicate
of
their
decision.
in
other
words,
if
--
as
i
read
that
that
really
the
milwaukee
conditions
were
the
main
purpose,
the
main
public
benefit,
the
main
reason
they
found
that
it
was
consistent
with
the
public
interest
and
had
it
not
been
for
that
they
would
have
found
it
was
inconsistent
with
the
public
interest
and
i
think
that
appears
two
or
three
times
in
the
second
report.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
they
had
given
up
as
they
said
on
the
northern
lines
ever
doing
proper
job
here
and
they
were
going
to
substantially
--
sir?
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
the
five
who
became
the
majority
in
the
second
report
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
don't
think
they
did
say
it
in
the
final
report
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
not
in
the
second
report,
no.
but
i
think
it's
a
fair
underlying
fact
that
you
can't
ignore
on
the
second
report.
i
think
--
i
don't
see
how
otherwise
they
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
except
in
the
finding
that
they
say
the
conditions
for
the
benefit
of
the
milwaukee
and
the
improvements
for
the
milwaukee
bringing
it
through
to
the
portland
area
are
necessary
predicate
and
i
have
the
impression
from
the
over
all
report
that
that's
really
the
main
benefit
that
is
--
that
the
icc
found
here.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
would
like
to
answer
that
if
i
may.
as
far
as
the
conditions
are
concerned,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
in
the
first
report,
they
assumed
the
conditions
as
to
the
milwaukee
at
least
which
are
i
think
preeminent.
now,
i'm
not
sure
that
they
assumed
the
attrition
agreements
in
favor
of
employees
and
it's
true
that
in
the
first
report
they
pointed
out
that
it
was
both
the
anti-competitive
effect
and
the
adverse
effect
on
employees,
it
was
bad.
but,
the
main
conditions
for
the
milwaukee,
i
think
had
been
considered.
as
far
as
the
savings
are
concerned,
the
new
evidence
that
came
in,
there
were
just
four
days
of
the
hearing
on
reconsideration,
three
of
them
with
proponents
and
one
for
rebuttal
and
the
savings
there,
the
additional
evidence
had
largely
to
do
with
simply
an
adjustment
factor
applying
a
percentage
to
previously
estimated
savings.
so,
i
don't
think
that
was
a
matter
of
new
evidence
particularly.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
anti-trust
division
petitioned
that
the
matter
be
reopened
both
to
find
out
who
many
more
changes
there
had
been
already
put
into
a
fact
like
this
faster
train
business
and
so
on.
and
also
what
savings
had
been
achieved
and
could
be
achieved
without
merger
and
this
was
denied
by
the
examiner
and
upheld
by
the
commission.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
that's
true,
that's
true
and
then
there
is
also
the
fact
that
the
milwaukee
and
the
northwestern
withdrew
their
opposition
because
they
--
each
had
agreed
to
the
others
mergering
effect.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
oh!
alright,
thank
you.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
we
have
approximately
that
time
and
the
livingston
committee
as
i
understand
would
like
to
have
two
minutes.
i
would
like
to,
if
i
may
answer
one
point
that
came
up
yesterday
and
then
to
finish
a
point
which
i
started
yesterday
and
did
not
conclude.
now,
it’s
been
argued
by
the
other
side
that
our
position
in
this
case
is
in
an
amorphous
one.
we
think
it
is
not,
it’s
very
clear
and
it’s
simply
this,
as
a
matter
of
law
section
52
of
the
commerce
act
when
(inaudible)
of
the
national
transportation
policy
does
not
authorize
the
merger
which
destroys
very
substantial
of
competition
among
healthy
railroads
who
dominate
their
territory
in
the
absence
of
a
serious
transportation
need
which
cannot
otherwise
be
met.
now,
mr.
justice
white
asked,
what
kind
of
mergers
will
this
permit?
well
first,
it
will
permit
a
vast
number
simply
because
most
roads
are
not
in
competition
with
one
another
or
if
they
are
in
competition
with
another,
it
may
very
well
be
in
relatively
small
area
and
that
they
cover
the
over
line
maybe
rather
negligible.
second,
this
would
not
prevent
mergers
of
strong
with
weak
roads
even
if
they
are
competing.
now,
these
two
types
of
merger
we
think
are
the
principle
once
which
congress
contemplated
but
to
passed
the
1920
and
the
1940
acts.
mergers
which
would
strengthen
the
small
and
weaker
roads
and
contribute
to
the
development
of
competing
systems
and
that’s
discussed
the
legislative
history
in
our
brief
at
page
30.
finally,
you
do
have
the
healthy
dominant
roads
who
are
head
to
head
competitors
and
what
kind
of
needs
would
justify
their
merger.
well,
in
our
view
examples
of
serious
transportation
needs
would
include
first
a
need
to
remedy
inadequate
service
which
cannot
otherwise
be
made
adequate.
perhaps
this
might
involve
the
opening
up
an
expensive
a
new
area
to
serve
if
for
some
reason
and
comes
to
mind
the
alaska
frontier
where
new
discoveries
come
as
very
difficult
to
reach.
second,
a
demonstrated
inability
of
the
merging
roads
to
separately
serve
expanding
or
projected
a
new
ship
or
markets.
third,
a
need
to
shore
up
a
weak
or
failing
line
whose
service
is
while
essential
cannot
be
maintained
without
the
drastic
remedy
of
merger.
and
here,
it
comes
to
mind
the
penn-central
merger.
fourth,
a
need
for
a
restructuring
in
order
to
restore
effective,
competitive
balance
in
a
major
area.
as
a
hypothetically
example,
it
might
be
perfectly
reasonable
to
authorize
the
merger
of
the
milwaukee
with
one
of
the
northern
lines.
if
milwaukee
cannot
otherwise
be
made
by
such
a
merger,
would
have
two
effects.
first,
it
would
leave
the
two
strong
direct
competitors
in
the
northern
tier
instead
of
the
situation
that’s
created
by
this
merger
where
a
one
enormously
dominant
company
and
one
relatively
weak
competitor
would
be
left.
secondly,
such
a
merger,
it
would
involve
only
a
relatively
small
of
the
competition
being
eliminated.
now,
mr.
cox
appears
to
concede
that
icc
proceeded
in
this
case
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
i
think
that’s
what
he
--that
the
term
he
used
but
it
was
not
guided
by
some
general
principle
of
law.
the
only
principle
of
which
we
seem
to
find
that
was
followed
in
the
second
report
is
that
the
statement
of
the
commission
that
the
policy
--
the
act
is
clearly
to
facilitate
and
thereby
a
foster
and
encourage
consolidations
which
can
be
shown
to
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
and
then
it
went
on
to
rely
upon
conclusory
language
that
the
benefits
of
the
merger
outweigh
the
laws
of
competition.
well
now,
as
i
start
to
argue
yesterday,
we
think
that
icc
did
give
up
too
easily
on
these
very
less
drastic
alternatives.
at
321
of
the
record,
it
said
in
the
second
report,
denial
of
the
applications
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
competition
between
the
northern
lines
would
merely
perpetually
the
existing
dominants
of
the
gn
and
the
np
in
the
northern
tier
and
then
it
went
on
to
say
it
would
relocate
the
milwaukee
to
an
increasing
the
marginal
and
deteriorating
role.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
five
minutes,
thank
you.
we
do
not
think
what
the
best
power
of
the
icc
to
supervise
as
mclean
trucking
indicates
that
it
has
that
this
statement
fairly
reflects
the
alternatives
that
the
commission
does
here.
for
example,
under
section
154
of
the
act,
icc
has
power
to
order
through
roads
and
to
open
gateways
when
this
is
“needed
in
order
to
provide
adequate
and
more
efficient
or
more
economic
transportation.”
and
we
think
that
if
there
is
a
transportation
need
for
this
merger
well
then
we
say
that
here
is
a
less
drastic
remedy
which
should
first
be
exhausted.
in
conclusion,
i
just
like
to
point
out
and
we
think
this
case
involves
an
issue
of
the
outmost
urgency
and
importance
going
to
the
end
--
enormous
changes
in
the
nation’s
railroad
structure
which
are
now
taking
place
in
particular.
the
propose
merger
represents
the
crucial
in
a
far
reaching
step
and
the
restructuring
of
the
western
rail
system.
if
the
commission’s
approach
in
this
case
is
valid,
other
roads
in
other
areas
can
present
similar
cost
saving
and
service
improvement
evidence
and
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
icc
could
turn
down
any
major
proposal
for
a
merger
of
parallel
competitors
even
where
they
are
dominant.
at
stake,
i
seriously
say
to
the
court
that
stake
is
the
whole
question
or
rail
competition
and
we
say
that
it
should
not
be
discarded.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
will
direct
my
argument
to
case
number
28,
the
united
states,
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
this
is
a
civil
case
which
comes
to
the
court
on
direct
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
a
three-judge
district
court.
the
district
court
denied
the
government's
request
for
an
injunction
and
upheld
the
icc's
approval
of
the
merger
of
the
great
northern
and
the
northern
pacific
railroads
which
have
been
referred
to
in
our
briefs
as
the
northern
lines
and
their
various
railroads
subsidiaries.
the
merger
has
been
stayed
by
this
court's
order.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
icc
correctly
applied
the
public
interest
test
of
section
5
(2)
(b)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
when
it
approved
this
merger,
holding
that
the
savings
and
service
benefits
of
the
merger
outweigh
the
elimination
of
substantial
rail
competition
between
the
northern
lines
in
the
northern
tier
of
western
states.
case
number
43,
the
city
of
auburn
case
is
related
to
our
case
and
that
it
also
raises
competitive
issues.
the
other
two
cases,
the
case
number
38,
the
brundage
case
involving
the
fairness
of
the
merger
terms
to
northern
pacific
stockholders
and
number
44,
the
livingston
case,
questioning
the
northern
pacific's
title
to
its
properties
raised
on
related
issues.
now,
although
the
record
in
this
case
is
a
very
long
one,
the
basic
facts
are
relatively
simple.
first,
i
would
like
to
identify
the
roads
which
proposed
to
merge
in
terms
of
the
areas
they
serve.
the
trunk
lines
of
the
merger
parties
are
shown
in
various
colors
on
the
fold
out
map
at
the
end
of
the
great
northern's
brief.
i've
taken
the
liberty
of
requesting
the
clerk
to
distribute
to
each
member
of
the
court
an
extra
copy
of
this
map
and
also
of
a
copy
of
the
map
which
is
prepared
from
exhibit
85
and
used
by
the
government
in
the
district
court
proceeding.
the
latter
shows
the
applicant
roads
as
they
will
appear
of
--
when
it
--
if
merged.
looking
first
at
the
great
northern's
map,
the
bigger
one,
you
will
see
that
the
great
northern
trunk
line
toward
the
top
in
red.
with
its
affiliates,
great
northern
carries
on
operations
over
some
80
-
200
miles
of
road
in
the
northern
tier
states
from
minneapolis
and
duluth,
duluth
from
the
east
to
spokane,
seattle,
portland
and
other
terminals
in
the
pacific
northwest.
northern
pacific,
in
green
on
the
map
and
its
affiliates
operate
over
some
6800
miles
of
road
somewhat
south
of
the
great
northern
and
they
serve
the
same
main
terminals
as
the
great
northern
in
minnesota
and
in
the
pacific
northwest.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
the
great
northern
map
your
honor
shows
that
the
trunk
lines
and

--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
yes,
your
honor
and
the
lighter
black
lines
show
more
or
less
branch
lines.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
they
are
on
that
particular
case,
yes
mr.
justice
stewart.
some
of
the
other
black
lines
shown
as
i
understand
belong
to
a
various
other
roads.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
shown
on
the
government's
map,
the
smaller
one
in
red
are
all
of
the
routes
as
they
will
appear
of
the
merged
roads
both
the
trunk
lines
and
branches.
the
chicago,
burlington
and
quincy,
a
road
that's
jointly
owned
by
the
northern
lines
is
shown
--
its
main
road
is
shown
in
brown
on
the
big
fold
out
map.
burlington
conducts
operations
over
some
8600
miles
of
road
running
northwest
from
chicago
and
minneapolis
and
also
west
from
chicago
to
serve
such
points
to
st.
luis
and
kansas
city,
omaha,
denver,
billings,
montana
and
with
the
connection
with
northern
pacific
in
montana.
subsidiaries
of
the
burlington
goes
out
as
far
as
the
texas
gulf
coast
as
is
shown
on
the
government
map
and
as
the
great
northern
map
shows,
i
think
the
burlington
service
tends
to
be
complimentary
to
rather
than
competitive
with
the
service
of
the
northern
lines.
also
involved
in
the
merger
is
the
spokane,
portland
and
seattle
railroad
about
600
miles
of
road
shown
in
blue
and
its
main
route
on
the
great
northern
map.
it
is
also
jointly
owned
by
the
northern
lines
and
its
mean
line
and
provides
their
shortest
route
from
spokane
down
to
portland.
the
third
line,
third
rail
line
providing
service
across
the
northern
tier
states
is
the
milwaukee
railroad
as
shown
in
black
on
the
government's
map
and
also
on
the
great
northern's.
now,
there's
no
dispute
that
the
northern
lines
are
financially
strong
firms.
they
owned
vast
acreage
of
valuable
land
and
mineral
rights
as
well
as
rail
and
motor
carrier
assets.
there
are
also
regularly
profitable
although
it's
fair
to
say
that
their
profits
have
fluctuated
over
the
years
and
do
not
reflect
a
large
percentage
return
on
their
invested
capital.
as
merged,
the
northern
lines
and
the
burlington
would
constitute
one
of
the
largest
rail
systems
in
the
country.
the
merged
company
would
have
some
27,000
miles
of
track
in
16
states,
total
assets
around
$3
billion,
annual
rail
revenues,
$823
million
and
net
income
in
the
neighborhood
of
$131
million
a
year.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
believe
mr.
justice
harlan
that
in
trackage
it
is
bigger,
in
terms
of
revenue,
it
is
not
as
big.
i'm
not
positive
of
those
figures.
as
the
maps
tend
to
indicate,
the
northern
lines
are
head
to
head
competitors
for
traffic
across
the
northern
tier
states.
each
is
the
main
competitor
of
the
other
and
the
milwaukee
is
a
very
weak
third.
the
nature
and
the
extent
of
this
competition,
rail
competition,
and
the
intermodal
competition
in
this
area
is
covered
by
the
findings
in
the
icc
reports
as
i'll
describe
in
just
a
moment.
to
summarize
the
proceedings
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
there
are
two
main
reports.
the
first,
disapproved
the
merger
on
grounds
that
it
would
have
a
drastically
adverse
effect
on
competition
as
well
as
the
adverse
effects
on
employees.
the
second
report
on
reconsideration
reversed
and
it
approved
the
merger.
i
should
say
that
the
findings
of
fact
in
the
first
report
are
of
significance
since
they
are
largely
found
again
in
the
second
report
which
is
based
on
substantially
the
same
record.
there
are
few
exceptions,
as
i
will
point
out.
i
also
think
that
the
rational
of
the
first
report
is
important
since
it's
our
contention
that
it
applied
the
correct
legal
standard
whereas
the
second
report
did
not.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
now
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
mr.
chief
justice
burger
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
believe
that
the
figures
that
your
honor
is
recalling
has
to
do
with
approximately
6%
that
points
where
the
northern
lines
are
the
only
rail
service.
i
believe
that
there
is
another
figure
of
some
on
37%
or
38%
where
they
compete
for
revenues
and
there
all
--
is
also
some
other
competition.
and
the
broad
figure
that
we
use
and
that
i
will
get
into
in
some
further
detail
a
little
bit
later
is
that
the
northern
lines
directly
compete
for
around
43%
of
their
revenue.
they
--
and
there's
an
additional
overhead
portion
of
their
revenue,
a
12%.
so,
we're
contending
that
they
are
competitors
for
about
55%
of
their
revenue.
there
are
some
other
figures
as
to
the
percentage
of
the
market
they
have
which
i
will
get
to.
it
runs
to
60%,
70%
and
80%
in
different
areas.
to
review
just
briefly,
the
proceedings
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission;
they
began
in
1961
when
the
applicant's
petition
for
authority
to
merge.
public
hearings
were
held
in
1961
and
1962
in
which
the
justice
department
participated
and
in
1964,
the
examiner
issued
a
report
recommending
the
merger
with
certain
conditions
be
approved.
the
matter
was
then
briefed
and
argued
before
the
icc
and
in
1966,
icc
issued
its
first
report
disapproving
the
merger
even
if
conditioned
as
demanded
by
various
interveners,
including
various
other
affected
railroads.
now,
in
the
course
to
this
first
report,
the
commission
analyzed
the
evidence
of
the
estimated
savings
to
the
applicants
in
merger
which
it
estimated
around
twenty
two
and
a
half
million
dollars
a
year
after
10
years.
the
report
detailed
and
analyzed
the
various
efficiencies,
principally
the
combining
of
yards
and
other
facilities
and
the
reduction
of
work
forces
and
the
report
listed
also
the
advantage
to
shippers,
principally
more
direct
routing
and
faster
schedules
all
of
which
the
merger
promised.
on
the
other
hand,
the
report
noted
that
applicants
could
coordinate
certain
facilities
and
realize
very
substantial
savings
without
merger.
it
pointed
out
that
the
applicants
are
“large,
strong
and
prosperous
railroads
and
growing
strong.”
it
also
found
that
their
long-term
train
was
favorable
as
against
motor
carriers.
it
found
that
ton
miles
of
freight
had
increase
substantially
during
the
1960
through
1964
period
and
it
found
that
the
railroads
had
what
it
called
a
decided
competitive
advantage
in
many
long
haul
of
movements.
now,
in
approaching
the
public
interest
test
laid
down
by
section
5
(2)
of
the
commerce
act,
the
commission
saw
its
task
as
one
of
determining
whether
the
adverse
effects
of
the
merger
upon
competition
and
on
carry
employees
were
outweighed
by
cost
savings
to
applicants
and
the
improved
service
to
shippers.
it
saw
the
public
interest
scale
as
being
imbalanced,
tipped
neither
for
nor
against
the
merger
under
the
law.
analyzing
the
competitive
effects
of
the
merger,
the
commission
focused
on
the
northern
tier
states
as
being
the
area
in
which
a
low
cost
rail
transportation
was
as
it
said
of
primary
importance
to
long-haul,
raw
material
shippers
in
the
area
where
rail
competition
would
be
most
adversely
affected
by
the
merger.
the
report
also
found
that
whereas
animal,
mineral,
agricultural
and
forest
products
account
for
around
60%
of
northern
lines'
revenues,
this
kind
of
traffic
was
generally
not
attractive
to
motor
carriers
and
was
not
highly
susceptible
to
diversion
to
motor
carriers.
in
fact,
it
found
that
intermodal
competition
is
not
as
strong
in
the
northern
states
here
as
in
other
parts
of
the
country.
the
report
also
found
that
the
northern
lines
were
in
direct
and
substantial
competition
with
one
another
and
then
when
this
was
eliminated,
the
merged
road
would
have
a
dominant
position
in
the
northern
tier
states.
for
example,
it
found
that
together
the
northern
lines
would
handle
61%
of
the
carload
traffic
moving
westbound
in
the
northern
tier
and
83%
eastbound.
as
to
west
coast
traffic
from
washington
to
california,
it
would
have
73.5%
moving
north
and
south
through
the
seista
and
beaver
gateways
and
that
it
would
move
67%
of
ton
10
miles
of
rail
freight
in
the
northern
tier
states;
45%
minnesota,
81%
north
dakota,
82%
in
montana
and
77%
in
washington.
after
the
merger,
the
first
report
found
that
northern
lines
would
as
the
report
said,
reign
supreme.
they
would
overshadow
all
their
rail
competitors
within
this
region
and
from
this
region
to
points
beyond.
measuring
the
competition
that
would
be
eliminated,
icc
found
that
the
northern
lines
were
in
direct
competition
as
i
mentioned
at
points
accounting
for
43%
of
their
revenues
and
further
that
they
competed
for
overhead
traffic
accounting
for
another
12%,
thus
the
merger
would
eliminate
the
competition
between
them
for
55%
of
their
total
revenues.
as
to
the
milwaukee
road,
the
icc
found
that
for
various
reasons,
it
was
a
handicap
and
weak
competitor.
it
accounted
for
only
12%
of
east-west
traffic
in
the
northern
tier.
the
first
report
recognized
that
the
milwaukee
could
be
strengthen
by
conditions
attached
to
the
merger
and
it
considered
these
conditions
principally,
the
granting
of
trackage
rights
into
portland,
oregon
and
into
billings,
montana
and
the
opening
of
11
gateways
where
it
could
exchange
traffic
with
northern
lines.
but
the
report
found
even
with
these
conditions,
the
benefits
would
be
as
it
said
minimum
and
milwaukee's
relative
competitive
position
after
the
merger
would
be
weaker
than
ever.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
believe
that
the
examiner's
report
denied
most
of
them,
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
then
the
--
in
the
first
report,
the
commission
took
it
assuming
as
i
understand
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
assuming
all
of
them,
yes
and
saying
that
even
though
they
had
all
these
gateways
and
the
new
terminal
on
the
coast
at
portland,
they
still
would
be
relatively
weaker.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
report
went
on
to
point
out
that
the
new
company
would
have
what
it
referred
to
as
tremendous
solicitation
advantages.
the
merged
company
would
and
it
noted
that
the
milwaukee's
solicitation
efforts
would
be
puny
by
comparison.
and
this
is
important
because
when
you
open
gateways,
this
is
a
two-way
street,
the
other
fellow
can
get
traffic
as
well
and
the
milwaukee
could
lose
as
well
as
to
gain
traffic.
now,
the
first
report
concluded
by
holding
that
applicants
had
failed
to
establish
that
the
--
that
the
merger
would
result
in
transportation
service
superior
to
that
which
could
be
provided
without
merger
and
indeed
“the
disadvantages
of
an
appropriately
conditioned
merger,
and
drastic
lessening
of
competition
and
adverse
effects
on
carrier
employees
outweigh
the
benefits
that
might
be
derived
by
applicants
in
the
shipping
public.”
now,
there
is
a
dissent
to
this
first
report.
five
commissioners
dissented
and
they
did
so
not
on
the
theory
that
the
northern
pacific
and
great
northern
are
less
dominant
then
the
majority
found,
but
on
the
theory
that
they
are
indolent
giants
who
do
not
now
bother
to
compete.
they
said
that
the
northern
lines
in
their
language
are
fat
and
happy.
they
split
the
lion's
share
of
the
northern
transcontinental
traffic
and
revenues
between
them
and
so
preserve
a
facade
of
competition.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
the
dissent
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
yes
mr.
justice
harlan,
and
six
on
majority,
it's
a
6
to
5
vote.
the
dissent
also
found
that
the
northern
lines
have
what
they
called
a
common
law
marriage
and
they
said
that
they
hold
shippers
captive
over
great
distances
with
a
virtual
lock
on
traffic
routed
through
spokane
and
the
twin
cities.
that
they
have
hamstrung
and
short-hauled
the
milwaukee
and
that
they've
condemned
it
to
a
marginal
and
steadily
deteriorating
existence.
the
dissent
concluded
that
what
was
really
needed
here
was
to
write
off
the
present
family
competition
as
it
called
it
by
using
the
conditioning
power
of
section
5
to
try
to
establish
the
milwaukee
as
a
genuine
and
authentic
competitor.
now,
i
emphasize
this
dissent
because
upon
reconsideration
as
i'll
describe
in
a
moment,
the
commission
reversed
itself
and
it
approved
the
merger
and
the
minority
became
the
majority
in
the
second
report
and
it
used
some
of
the
same
language
in
reasoning
as
in
the
dissent
some
of
which
i
have
just
read.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
mr.
justice
harlan
there
was
a
change
in
some
people
on
the
commission.
the
new
lineup
was
eight
to
two
and
one
abstaining.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
think
two
must
have
shifted
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
no,
it's
not
a
question
entirely,
the
question
is
very
sound.
there
were
two
or
three,
two
that
shifted.
well,
after
the
first
report
was
issued
in
december
1966,
the
applicants
petitioned
the
icc
for
reconsideration.
they
formally
stated
that
they
were
willing
to
accept
various
conditions
including
all
those
asked
for
by
the
milwaukee
and
the
chicago
northwestern
railroads.
at
the
same
time,
applicants
said
it
into
an
agreement
with
those
two
roads,
the
milwaukee
and
the
chicago
northwestern
not
to
oppose
their
proposed
merger
in
return
for
which
the
milwaukee
and
chicago
northwestern
agreed
to
withdraw
their
opposition
and
support
the
northern
lines'
merger.
the
applicants
also
filed
their
agreement
to
enter
into
attrition
agreements
for
the
benefit
of
employees
and
they
urged
that
icc
had
erred
in
estimating
merger
savings
in
the
first
report
and
that
these
would
be
substantially
greater
and
that
it
had
found
and
that
it
asked
for
further
evidence
to
be
heard
on
this
subject.
in
january
1967,
the
commission
granted
the
petition.
they
issued
an
order,
reopening
the
proceedings
and
as
the
latter
report
stated,
this
was
a
limited
reopening.
the
further
hearing
was
limited
solely
to
determining
and
the
basis
of
the
most
current
information
readily
available,
the
amount
of
estimated
savings
resulting
from
the
proposed
merger
in
the
light
of
one,
agreements
entered
into
between
the
applicants
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other,
the
milwaukee
and
the
northwestern
and
second,
the
effect
of
relevant
financial,
operational
and
another
changes
related
to
savings
which
have
occurred
subsequently
to
the
close
of
hearing
recon
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
the
personnel
did
change
mr.
justice
black.
i
believe
that
in
the
second
report,
there
were
eight
in
the
majority
and
this
included
five
that
had
been
in
the
majority
before
plus
two
that
had
changed
and
plus
one
new
commissioner.
there
were
two
that
still
were
dissenting
and
then
there
was
one
new
commissioner
who
did
not
participate.
i
believe
that
was
the
lineup.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
there
was
one
new
commissioner
who
did
not,
there
were
two
who
did.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
no,
there
were
five
in
the
original
dissent.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
believe
i'm
right
in
thinking
that
there
were
three
different
commissioners.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i'm
sorry
sir,
i
don't
have
that
information,
i
could
get
it.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
think
that
that's
right
mr.
chief
justice
that
that
were
two
from
the
former
majority
that
switched
and
then
one
new
commissioner
that
added
to
the
original
five
maybe
eight
and
there
was
one
new
commissioner
who
didn't
participate.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
that
would
do
it,
yes,
because
they
had
five
and
they
did
get
the
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
they
did
get
the
majority
from
--
by
one
of
the
commissioners.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
really
can't
speak
on
that
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
the
basic
fact
here
is
that
there
was
a
change
in
the
standard
that
they
applied.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
see,
they're
seven
or
eight
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
that's
right.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
eight
to
two
and
one
abstained.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
out
if
the
majority?
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
our
basic
contention
mr.
justice
harlan
is
that
the
commission
failed
on
the
second
report
to
apply
a
public
need
standard
which
is
the
basic
issue
that
was
presented
to
the
court.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
it's
a
very
difficult
question
mr.
justice
black
because
the
court
has
laid
out
the
requirement
for
an
accommodation
of
the
transportation
act,
the
organization
of
roads
into
systems
in
and
to
serving
the
needs
and
requirements
of
efficient
transportation.
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
has
held
that
we
do
have
a
national
policy
favoring
competition
and
that
the
cases
say
that
the
commission
in
approaching
this
merger
cases
must
accommodate
the
views
and
the
policies
of
these
two
statutes
in
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
by
--
not
among
the
same
identical
parties,
but
i
think
mr.
justice
black
and
you
have
for
example
in
your
penn
central
merger,
a
situation
where
the
roads
merged
and
the
commission
had
in
mind
the
remaining
competition
from
the
norfolk
and
western
road
and
from
the
chesapeake
in
ohio
system
that
was
coming
along.
it
looked
at
the
fact
that
you
have
a
network
of
good
roads
and
strong
intermodal
competition
and
then
it
found
a
public
interest
factor
here
in
that
the
roads
had
the
burden
of
providing
public
service
through
commutation
in
cities
and
if
they
had
the
very
puzzling
and
difficult
problem
of
what
to
do
with
the
bankrupt
new
haven
railroad.
and
the
in-balance,
all
parties
felt
in
the
penn
central
litigation
that
that
merger
was
a
good
thing
and
when
it
came
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
that's
very
true.
and
the
matter
did
not
come
to
the
court
although
it
came
to
the
court
on
other
issues,
it
did
not
come
up
on
the
competitive
question.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
didn't
understand
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
we're
opposing
it
on
the
theory
mr.
justice
black
that
if
you
have
healthy
directly
competing
railroads,
they
do
not
need
this
merger
in
order
to
continue
to
give
good
service.
they
are
dominant
in
this
area
of
the
northern
tier
states.
and
we
think
that
under
those
conditions,
the
requirement
of
accommodation
of
the
policy
of
the
transportation
act
and
of
the
anti-trust
laws
required
the
thing
--
that
such
an
act
a
competitive
merger
not
be
permitted
unless
they're
--
it
serves
a
real
public
need
and
that
that
kind
of
elimination
of
competition
should
not
be
permitted
merely
to
serve
the
private
interest
of
the
parties.
and
if
there
are
public
interests
that
are
being
saved
--
served
by
the
merger,
but
if
they
could
be
served
by
a
less
anti
competitive
alternative
then
the
merger
should
not
be
permitted.
the
lesser
competitive
alternatives
should
be
put
into
effect
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
after
all
under
the
law
is
given
vast
powers,
and
great
discretion
to
regulate
and
to
supervise
the
affairs
of
the
railroad.
and
in
this
case,
it's
our
contention
that
the
commerce
commission
should
have
considered
to
what
extent
it
could
have
opened
up
the
gateways
in
order
to
strengthen
the
milwaukee
if
that
was
the
matter
of
public
interest
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
certainly,
if
an
area
has
inadequate
service
and
the
way
to
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
--
get
out
of
it
is
to
have
a
merger.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
--
that
would
be
one,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
no.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
no,
i
don't
think
that's
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
don't
think
that's
true.
we
don't
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
better
service
might
be
enough
but
if
it's
terribly
anticompetitive
merger,
if
the
better
service
can
be
achieved
by
a
less
anti
competitive
alternative
then
the
merger
should
not
be
permitted
unless
there
is
some
real
public
need
for
it.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
that's
one
of
the
things,
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
they
did
that
in
the
first
report.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
i
think
if
they
found
--
made
that
finding
and
that
the
--
there
was
a
need
of
public
service
resulting
from
this,
i
think
that
they
would
have
that
power.
i'm
not
sure
that
we
wouldn't
be
here
because
i
think
that
then
the
court
has
a
right
to
look
at
the
situation
and
see
if
the
--
if
that
determination
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
and
i
seriously
question
in
this
particular
case
that
the
commission
has
done
more
than
really
give
lip
service
to
the
question
of
the
value
of
competition.
they
have
followed
the
dissent,
the
point
i
made
a
little
earlier
that
after
all
these
giants
have
not
competed
for
years,
they
have
thrown
up
their
hands,
given
up
hope
and
they
have
said,
“well,
let's
let
them
merge
and
we'll
try
and
make
something
out
of
the
milwaukee
and
maybe
it
will
provide
the
competition
that
we
can't
get
from
the
northern
lines.”
well,
on
the
second
report,
the
commission
came
out
and
they
said
that
this
is
a
matter
where
we
--
where
an
error
of
the
savings
that
will
come
from
the
merger,
there
will
be
some
$39
million
of
savings
after
few
years
instead
of
the
$22
million
or
$25
million
earlier
estimated
and
they
dwelt
at
some
length
on
the
improved
service
which
was
estimated
would
result
from
the
merger.
but,
they
did
say
no
prospective
service
benefits
that
had
not
been
considered
in
the
first
report.
and
i
think
what's
fair
to
say
that
what
they
did
do
on
the
second
report
was
to
discard
or
reverse
two
principles
of
analysis
which
had
been
followed
by
a
majority
in
the
first
report.
they
took
a
new
perspective
as
they
say.
first,
they
determined
to
focus
not
so
much
on
competitive
effects
in
the
northern
tier
states
where
competition
would
be
eliminated,
but
rather
they
broadened
out
the
focus.
and
they
took
the
broad
view
of
the
total
area
that
was
served
by
all
of
the
merger
parties,
including
that
down
in
the
central
corridor
which
is
served
by
the
burlington.
and
of
course
the
effect
on
competition
looked
somewhat
less
drastic
taking
that
view.
second,
in
considering
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
the
merger,
the
commission
determined
the
primary
weigh
not
be
given
to
the
competition
eliminated,
that
is
the
competition
for
55%
of
their
revenue
because
it
held
that
the
--
there
was
substantial
intermodal
as
well
as
intramodal
competition
that
that
would
survive
the
merger.
on
this
basis,
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
that
was
argued
in
the
lower
court
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
think
that
they
are
kind
of
on
both
sides
of
that
question.
there
was
from
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
yes
sir.
there
was
an
indication
that
in
the
first
report
that
there
is
a
presumption
in
favor
of
mergers.
on
the
other
hand,
there
was
a
statement
that
the
matter
is
in
balance
and
then
the
same
thing
in
effect
was
said
in
the
second
report.
it
does
appear
to
us
that
they
in
effect
did
accept
the
idea
that
there's
a
presumption
in
favor
of
mergers
that
are
brought
up
by
the
private
parties
in
the
second
report
whereas
they
gave
competition,
a
certain
value
and
weight
in
the
first
report
that
they
didn't
in
the
second
report.
but
there,
the
difficulty
as
they
pointed
out
in
the
first
report,
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that
you
have
the
difficult
task
of
weighing
an
intangible
value
of
competition.
on
the
one
hand
against
the
savings
from
merger
the
tangible
values
that
you
can
say,
well,
it's
$25
million
a
year
and
how
do
you
say
whether
competition
is
worth
$25
million
a
year?
i
think
that
there
is
some
indication
in
the
recent
holdings
of
the
court
that
starting
with
mclean
where
this
test
was
laid
out
that
there
must
be
the
accommodation.
the
commission
must
consider
on
the
one
hand
the
anticompetitive
consequences
on
the
other,
the
savings,
the
improvements
in
service
and
so
on.
that
was
spelled
out
first
in
mclean,
it
was
followed
in
the
denver,
it
was
followed
in
the
st.
louis
--
minneapolis
st.
louis
case
and
it
has
been
referred
to
at
various
times
since
then.
i
think
that
two
or
three
of
the
court's
more
recent
cases
have
cast
some
additional
light
on
this
in
the
sense
that
the
court
has
treated
competition
as
the
basic
policy
and
it
has
treated
the
power
of
the
administrative
agency
to
grant
immunity
from
that
as
carrying
a
rather
important
determination
that
is
to
be
made
by
the
administrative
agency
and
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
svenska
is
one
them,
the
denver
rio
grand
case
i
think
is
one
of
them.
that's
the
railroad
express
agency
stock
purchase
and
in
the
denver
rio
grand
opinion,
there's
a
passage
that
has
to
do
and
it
points
out
that
this
five
to
power
is
the
power
to
grant
immunity
from
the
policy
which
favors
the
competition.
and
it
implies
that
this
is
a
matter
of
considerable
importance
for
the
commission
to
determine.
and
i
think
that
when
you
then
get
to
the
svenska
case,
and
two,
that
was
a
maritime
case
and
two,
it
was
not
a
merger
case,
but
it
did
specifically
mentioned
two
of
the
rail
merger
cases
and
it
said
that
those
cases
follow
the
same
pattern.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
yes,
yes
it
certainly
is
mr.
chief
justice,
but
our
point
on
that
is
that
the
original
figures
came
out
and
i
don't
remember
them
precisely,
but
i
think
the
rail
time
from
the
northwest
down
into
the
chicago
area
was
something
like
94
hours
and
they
said,
when
we
merge
we
can
put
together
better,
more
direct
runs
and
we
can
cut
12
hours
off
of
that.
but
before
the
record
was
closed
because
the
milwaukee
had
put
through
some
faster
trains,
they'd
cut
more
than
12
hours
off
already.
they
took
some
lighter
weight
equipment
and
they
were
more
careful
in
their
scheduling
and
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
them,
if
your
honor
please,
to
work
out
these
better
routings
without
merger.
they
don't
have
to
merge
these
railroads
in
order
to
get
direct
routings
and
that's
what
the
minority,
what
the
dissent
in
the
first
report
was
pointing
to.
they
have
sat
here
fat
and
happy
they've
been
entirely
unwilling
to
take
advantage
of
the
possibilities
that
they
were
for
more
direct
routings
to
try
and
meet
the
truck
competition
that
the
other
side
talks
about.
they
could've
done
that,
they
don't
have
to
merge
to
do
it,
and
they
could
cut
very,
very
substantial
time
of
the
run
from
the
west
down
into
the
markets
where
they
need
to
market
these
products
from
the
raw
materials
country.
referring
once
again
to
the
svenska
case,
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
the
--
the
--
this
came
up
on
the
maritime
commissions
power
which
is
comparable
to
the
commission's
power
to
grant
immunity
to
an
anticompetitive
arrangement
and
there
i
think
it
was
an
exclusive
dealing
arrangement
and
referring
to
the
question
of
the
national
economic
policy,
the
court
pointed
out
that
another
lies
illegal
arrangement
and
as
the
court
said,
“alone,
will
normally
constitute
substantial
evidence
that
the
agreement
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
unless
other
evidence
fairly
detracts
from
the
weight
of
this
factor.”
now,
we
contend
that
the
maritime
commission
rule
that
was
discussed
and
upheld
in
svenska
precisely
describes
the
standard
which
governs
here.
fmc's
rule
put
the
burden
on
the
proponent
of
the
anticompetitive
agreement
just
as
we
would
put
the
burden
on
the
applicants
to
merge,
to
demonstrate
that
it
was
required
by
a
serious
transportation
need,
necessary
to
secure
important
public
benefits
for
--
in
furtherance
of
a
valid
regulatory
purpose.
and
the
court
not
only
upheld
the
svenska
--
fmc
rule,
but
it
stated
that
the
standard
was
“in
full
accord
with
the
kind
of
accommodation
between
anti-trust
and
regulatory
objectives
approved
by
this
court
in
the
seaboard
airline
in
minneapolis
st.
paul
rail
merger
decisions.”
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
that
the
--
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
that
in
the
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
in
the
first
report,
i
think
that
the
commission
majority
followed
the
standard
that
i
have
just
described.
they
gave
some
real
weight
not
just
lip
service
to
the
value
of
competition.
they
considered
the
possibility
that
the
advantages
of
the
merger
could
be
achieved
by
less
competitive
means.
and
then
they
looked
at
what
was
left
over
that
would
just
be
accomplished
by
merger
and
they
said,
“that
isn't
enough
because
on
the
other
hand
you'd
eliminate
all
this
competition
and
virtually
create
a
rail
monopoly
in
this
northern
tier
states.”
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
and
our
view
is
that
it
being
--
the
second
report
being
in
effect
took
the
savings
claimed
by
the
carriers
and
they
looked
at
the
better
service
that
would
be
given
and
they
threw
up
their
hands
as
far
as
their
actual
powers
to
regulate
and
to
force
competition
and
to
give
the
milwaukee
a
viable
position
in
this
market.
and
they
said,
“okay,
let
them
merge,
we'll
try
and
work
out
conditions
that
will
make
the
milwaukee
for
the
first
time
give
shippers
in
the
area,
for
the
first
time
a
realistic
choice
of
carriers.”
i
believe
it
was
somewhat
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
don't
think
that
in
the
second
report,
they
really
gave
value
to
the
question
of
competition
nor
did
they
bear
on
the
question
of
the
public
need
for
the
thing.
in
other
words,
there
is
--
there
must
first
be
a
public
benefit
from
it.
secondly,
there
must
be
a
need
for
it
and
there
isn't
a
need
for
it
if
it
can
be
done
by
a
less
drastic
means.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
that's
the
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
and
that's
the
test
for
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
don't
think
i
can
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
fine.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
think
that
you
can
tell
in
the
first
report
in
the
final
paragraph
where
they
had
said
that
the
proponents
of
the
merger
have
failed
to
carry
their
burden
of
establishing
this
and
they
point
to
the
fact
that
there
are
less
drastic
alternatives.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
165
and
166,
i
believe
your
honor.
on
page
166,
they
point
out
that
the
--
to
find
competition
is
not
worth
between
12
and
25
million
a
year
less
expenditures
to
achieve
those
savings
would
be
tantamount
to
a
conclusion
that
the
value
of
intramodal
rail
competition
is
negligible.
and
they
mentioned
this
tangible
savings
factor
but
they
have
said
that
they
were
convinced
that
they
are
not
as
great
as
the
value
of
competition
and
they
conclude
that
the
disadvantages
of
the
appropriately
conditioned
merger,
the
drastic
lessening
of
competition
and
adverse
effect
on
carrier
employees
outweigh
the
benefits
that
might
be
derive
by
applicants
and
the
shipping
public.
and
i
think
the
standard
follows
there
in
the
top
of
167,
applicants
have
failed
to
show
that
their
proposed
merger
would
result
in
transportation
service
to
the
public
that
is
superior
to
that
which
can
be
provided
without
merger
or
that
the
benefits
reasonably
attributable
to
the
proposed
merger
outweigh
the
adverse
effects
of
the
merger
on
carrier
employees
and
the
benefits
that
shippers
derived
from
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
i
just
don't
read
it
that
way
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
seems
to
me
that
they
abandoned
the
possibility
that
the
commission
has
this
broad
power
to
bring
about
the
better
service
that
is
anticipated
here
and
then
what
you
left,
have
left
in
this
merger
is
really
private
benefits.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
the
second
time,
i
think
they
really
followed
what
the
dissent
had
talked
about
that
they
were
going
to
strengthen
the
milwaukee
and
they
said
in
the
second
report
on
reconsideration
which
comes
a
good
bit
later
in
another
volume,
they
said
that
the
milwaukee
conditions
are
a
necessary
predicate
of
their
decision.
in
other
words,
if
--
as
i
read
that
that
really
the
milwaukee
conditions
were
the
main
purpose,
the
main
public
benefit,
the
main
reason
they
found
that
it
was
consistent
with
the
public
interest
and
had
it
not
been
for
that
they
would
have
found
it
was
inconsistent
with
the
public
interest
and
i
think
that
appears
two
or
three
times
in
the
second
report.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
they
had
given
up
as
they
said
on
the
northern
lines
ever
doing
proper
job
here
and
they
were
going
to
substantially
--
sir?
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
the
five
who
became
the
majority
in
the
second
report
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
don't
think
they
did
say
it
in
the
final
report
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
not
in
the
second
report,
no.
but
i
think
it's
a
fair
underlying
fact
that
you
can't
ignore
on
the
second
report.
i
think
--
i
don't
see
how
otherwise
they
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
except
in
the
finding
that
they
say
the
conditions
for
the
benefit
of
the
milwaukee
and
the
improvements
for
the
milwaukee
bringing
it
through
to
the
portland
area
are
necessary
predicate
and
i
have
the
impression
from
the
over
all
report
that
that's
really
the
main
benefit
that
is
--
that
the
icc
found
here.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
would
like
to
answer
that
if
i
may.
as
far
as
the
conditions
are
concerned,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
in
the
first
report,
they
assumed
the
conditions
as
to
the
milwaukee
at
least
which
are
i
think
preeminent.
now,
i'm
not
sure
that
they
assumed
the
attrition
agreements
in
favor
of
employees
and
it's
true
that
in
the
first
report
they
pointed
out
that
it
was
both
the
anti-competitive
effect
and
the
adverse
effect
on
employees,
it
was
bad.
but,
the
main
conditions
for
the
milwaukee,
i
think
had
been
considered.
as
far
as
the
savings
are
concerned,
the
new
evidence
that
came
in,
there
were
just
four
days
of
the
hearing
on
reconsideration,
three
of
them
with
proponents
and
one
for
rebuttal
and
the
savings
there,
the
additional
evidence
had
largely
to
do
with
simply
an
adjustment
factor
applying
a
percentage
to
previously
estimated
savings.
so,
i
don't
think
that
was
a
matter
of
new
evidence
particularly.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
anti-trust
division
petitioned
that
the
matter
be
reopened
both
to
find
out
who
many
more
changes
there
had
been
already
put
into
a
fact
like
this
faster
train
business
and
so
on.
and
also
what
savings
had
been
achieved
and
could
be
achieved
without
merger
and
this
was
denied
by
the
examiner
and
upheld
by
the
commission.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
that's
true,
that's
true
and
then
there
is
also
the
fact
that
the
milwaukee
and
the
northwestern
withdrew
their
opposition
because
they
--
each
had
agreed
to
the
others
mergering
effect.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
oh!
alright,
thank
you.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
we
have
approximately
that
time
and
the
livingston
committee
as
i
understand
would
like
to
have
two
minutes.
i
would
like
to,
if
i
may
answer
one
point
that
came
up
yesterday
and
then
to
finish
a
point
which
i
started
yesterday
and
did
not
conclude.
now,
it’s
been
argued
by
the
other
side
that
our
position
in
this
case
is
in
an
amorphous
one.
we
think
it
is
not,
it’s
very
clear
and
it’s
simply
this,
as
a
matter
of
law
section
52
of
the
commerce
act
when
(inaudible)
of
the
national
transportation
policy
does
not
authorize
the
merger
which
destroys
very
substantial
of
competition
among
healthy
railroads
who
dominate
their
territory
in
the
absence
of
a
serious
transportation
need
which
cannot
otherwise
be
met.
now,
mr.
justice
white
asked,
what
kind
of
mergers
will
this
permit?
well
first,
it
will
permit
a
vast
number
simply
because
most
roads
are
not
in
competition
with
one
another
or
if
they
are
in
competition
with
another,
it
may
very
well
be
in
relatively
small
area
and
that
they
cover
the
over
line
maybe
rather
negligible.
second,
this
would
not
prevent
mergers
of
strong
with
weak
roads
even
if
they
are
competing.
now,
these
two
types
of
merger
we
think
are
the
principle
once
which
congress
contemplated
but
to
passed
the
1920
and
the
1940
acts.
mergers
which
would
strengthen
the
small
and
weaker
roads
and
contribute
to
the
development
of
competing
systems
and
that’s
discussed
the
legislative
history
in
our
brief
at
page
30.
finally,
you
do
have
the
healthy
dominant
roads
who
are
head
to
head
competitors
and
what
kind
of
needs
would
justify
their
merger.
well,
in
our
view
examples
of
serious
transportation
needs
would
include
first
a
need
to
remedy
inadequate
service
which
cannot
otherwise
be
made
adequate.
perhaps
this
might
involve
the
opening
up
an
expensive
a
new
area
to
serve
if
for
some
reason
and
comes
to
mind
the
alaska
frontier
where
new
discoveries
come
as
very
difficult
to
reach.
second,
a
demonstrated
inability
of
the
merging
roads
to
separately
serve
expanding
or
projected
a
new
ship
or
markets.
third,
a
need
to
shore
up
a
weak
or
failing
line
whose
service
is
while
essential
cannot
be
maintained
without
the
drastic
remedy
of
merger.
and
here,
it
comes
to
mind
the
penn-central
merger.
fourth,
a
need
for
a
restructuring
in
order
to
restore
effective,
competitive
balance
in
a
major
area.
as
a
hypothetically
example,
it
might
be
perfectly
reasonable
to
authorize
the
merger
of
the
milwaukee
with
one
of
the
northern
lines.
if
milwaukee
cannot
otherwise
be
made
by
such
a
merger,
would
have
two
effects.
first,
it
would
leave
the
two
strong
direct
competitors
in
the
northern
tier
instead
of
the
situation
that’s
created
by
this
merger
where
a
one
enormously
dominant
company
and
one
relatively
weak
competitor
would
be
left.
secondly,
such
a
merger,
it
would
involve
only
a
relatively
small
of
the
competition
being
eliminated.
now,
mr.
cox
appears
to
concede
that
icc
proceeded
in
this
case
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
i
think
that’s
what
he
--that
the
term
he
used
but
it
was
not
guided
by
some
general
principle
of
law.
the
only
principle
of
which
we
seem
to
find
that
was
followed
in
the
second
report
is
that
the
statement
of
the
commission
that
the
policy
--
the
act
is
clearly
to
facilitate
and
thereby
a
foster
and
encourage
consolidations
which
can
be
shown
to
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
and
then
it
went
on
to
rely
upon
conclusory
language
that
the
benefits
of
the
merger
outweigh
the
laws
of
competition.
well
now,
as
i
start
to
argue
yesterday,
we
think
that
icc
did
give
up
too
easily
on
these
very
less
drastic
alternatives.
at
321
of
the
record,
it
said
in
the
second
report,
denial
of
the
applications
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
competition
between
the
northern
lines
would
merely
perpetually
the
existing
dominants
of
the
gn
and
the
np
in
the
northern
tier
and
then
it
went
on
to
say
it
would
relocate
the
milwaukee
to
an
increasing
the
marginal
and
deteriorating
role.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
five
minutes,
thank
you.
we
do
not
think
what
the
best
power
of
the
icc
to
supervise
as
mclean
trucking
indicates
that
it
has
that
this
statement
fairly
reflects
the
alternatives
that
the
commission
does
here.
for
example,
under
section
154
of
the
act,
icc
has
power
to
order
through
roads
and
to
open
gateways
when
this
is
“needed
in
order
to
provide
adequate
and
more
efficient
or
more
economic
transportation.”
and
we
think
that
if
there
is
a
transportation
need
for
this
merger
well
then
we
say
that
here
is
a
less
drastic
remedy
which
should
first
be
exhausted.
in
conclusion,
i
just
like
to
point
out
and
we
think
this
case
involves
an
issue
of
the
outmost
urgency
and
importance
going
to
the
end
--
enormous
changes
in
the
nation’s
railroad
structure
which
are
now
taking
place
in
particular.
the
propose
merger
represents
the
crucial
in
a
far
reaching
step
and
the
restructuring
of
the
western
rail
system.
if
the
commission’s
approach
in
this
case
is
valid,
other
roads
in
other
areas
can
present
similar
cost
saving
and
service
improvement
evidence
and
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
icc
could
turn
down
any
major
proposal
for
a
merger
of
parallel
competitors
even
where
they
are
dominant.
at
stake,
i
seriously
say
to
the
court
that
stake
is
the
whole
question
or
rail
competition
and
we
say
that
it
should
not
be
discarded.
thank
you.
