mr.
boult
you
may
precede
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
aren't
these
regulations
in
a
different
category?
they're
provided
for
an
institution
of
learning,
at
least
don't
have
the
stature
or
status
of
the
law,
statute
or
city
ordinance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
people
who
were
doing
the
drafting
at
least
at
the
time
and
in
the
context
in
which
they
were
originally
drafting
were
probably
proceeding
on
the
assumption
that
these
students
were
coming
to
these
institutions
to
study
and
to
learn,
and
they
didn't
give
them
perhaps
the
kind
of
detailed
attention
they
would
give
them
if
they
were
rewriting
them
today?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
that
the
standards
which
you're
challenging
are
not
adequate
to
give
warning
that
language
used
in
the
exhibit
six
about
puppet
fools
and
racist
dogs
and
so
forth
address
toward
the
university
authorities
is
not
covered?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
that
that
does
not
give
notice
that
the
university
would
regard
that
as
disrespectful?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
we
were
dealing
a
libel
case
under
times
and
sullivan,
i
could
understand
your
argument
a
little
bit
better
that
you
--
under
times
and
sullivan,
you
could
call
the
president
of
the
university
or
the
senator,
almost
anyone
else
a
racist
pig
or
what
not
with
some
considerable
impunity,
but
this
is
not
a
libel
case.
this
is
a
situation
or
regulations
that
were
trying
to
govern
conduct,
so
that
civilized
people
could
function
in
the
university
complex
without
friction,
without
conflict
with
each
other.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
they
had
existed
in
the
past.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
in
this
court,
when
a
lawyer
submitted,
you've
heard
the
oath
many
times
and
you
took
it
yourself.
it's
an
oath
to
conduct
oneself
uprightly
and
according
to
law.
now
suppose
in
the
course
of
an
argument,
one
counsel
addressed
another
as
a
racist
pig,
do
you
think
that
would
be
beyond
the
reach
of
that
rule
because
that
rule
is
too
vague,
it's
over
broad
that
oath
of
office,
the
rule
of
conduct
within
the
chambers
of
this
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
first
amendment
prevails
in
this
room
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
and
it
does.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
couldn't
write
in
a
brief
without
getting
into
very
grave
trouble
could
you
in
this
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
university
can't
have
a
rule
like
that
for
the
conduct
of
students
on
the
campus
and
buildings.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
we
disbarred
a
lawyer
for
this
kind
of
conduct,
that
would
be
a
pretty
severe
penalty,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
take
it
you
more
or
less
concede
that
we
might
to
take
very
severe
action
against
a
lawyer
who
engaged
in
this
kind
of
utterance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
still
have
more
time
left
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright.

we

off
yesterday
afternoon.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
boult,
you
have
about
nine
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
doesn't
means
they
ignored
it,
that
means
they
didn't
--
they
ignored
it.
they
didn't
say
they
exonerated
him
on
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
to
have
it
adequate
other
examples.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
the
conduct
in
which
these
criminal
charges
developed
on
the
campus
or
off
the
campus?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
he
could
not
be
dismissed
laying
aside
the
notice
fact
that
he
could
not
be
dismissed
for
conduct
off
the
campus?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
the
falsehood
is
committed
as
part
of
the
response
to
other
charges,
do
you
mean
to
suggest
they
have
to
start
all
over
and
give
them
some
new
charges
when
they
--
the
very
people
sitting
in
the
room
have
heard
him
commit
what
they
regard
as
a
falsehood?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
this
isn't
a
criminal
proceeding
counsel.
you're
trying
to
equate
this
to
a
criminal
proceeding
with
all
the
constitutional
protections
of
criminal
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
want
us
to
reexamine
the
issue
of
credibility
in
this
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
he's
got
a
license
to
lie
in
his
defense
with
impunity,
could
that
be
the
essence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
the
new
proceeding
you
think
like
a
perjury
proceeding
in
the
criminals
case.
chief
