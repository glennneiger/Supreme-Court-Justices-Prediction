mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
associate
justices.
this
case
concerns
a
college
student,
not
a
school
child,
a
college
student,
who
was
dismissed
from
state
university
for
handing
out
one
leaflet
on
the
campus
not
in
or
about
any
classroom.
the
issues
break
down
into
four.
the
regulations
involved
prohibit
disrespect
for
authority
and
any
other
conduct
requiring
severe
discipline.
we
contend
that
these
are
void
for
vagueness
and
over
over
breadth,
primarily
our
first
amendment
contention,
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
notice
is
also
subsumed
in
the
question.
next,
we
contend
simply
that
they
are
void
as
applied,
you
cannot
outlaw
the
distribution
of
literature
or
more
specific
to
this
case
put
somebody
out
of
school
for
it.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
three
in
this
package
your
honor.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
certiorari
was
denied
as
to
the
other
two.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
three
--
the
four
issues,
three
of
the
four
issues
were
identical
to
all
three
petitioners.
the
factual
issue
varied
as
to
each
of
the
three.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
you
do
not
have
to
your
honor.
in
some
cases,
it's
done
for
example
auburn
v.
laurie
(ph)
held
the
georgia
statute
both
--
unconstitutional
both
on
its
face
and
as
applied.
there
is
no
choice
between
the
two
issues
--
between
the
two
approaches
on
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
that's
right
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
that
in
the
way
the
first
amendment
litigation
is
going
nowadays,
so
many
dombrowski
type
actions,
it
--
the
first
point
of
reference
is
more
often
the
facial
unconstitutionality
rather
than
the
applicatory.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
yes.
it's
plaintiff's
exhibit
six
which
appears
at
page
175
of
the
record.
and
the
other
two
issues
involved
are
due
process
issues,
one
having
to
do
with
the
composition
of
panel
and
its
conduct.
in
fact,
the
advisory
committee
that
is
the
university
disciplinary
committee,
its
confusion
of
functions
being
essentially
everything
and
therefore
inherently
biased,
presumptively
biased.
and
i
think
in
this
case
also
biased
as
a
matter
of
proof.
and
fourth,
procedural
due
process
time
and
type
of
notice
and
in
fact
that
a
new
contention
was
brought
in
at
the
hearing,
they
found
without
ever
bringing
it
up
at
the
hearing,
the
hearing
of
the
--
in
fact,
the
advisory
committee's
findings
said
that
the
student
had
not
told
the
truth
at
the
hearing,
of
course,
he
never
had
the
chance
to
rebut
this.
the
facts
on
the
leafleting
issue
are
very
brief.
he
handed
it.
he
was
found
to
have
handed
out,
that's
plaintiff's
exhibit
six
although
there
is
considerable
doubt
whether
he
actually
did
hand
it
out
or
not,
hand
it
to
the
president
of
the
university.
the
president
was
the
only
solid
witness
on
this
point.
one
other
witness
testified
that
she
saw
him
hand
it
out
in
the
cafeteria.
however,
she
testified
that
she
saw
him
do
this
some
two,
three
or
four
months
before
the
leaflet
was
prepared.
so,
we
assumed
that
there
is
only
witness
against
him,
the
president
of
the
university
and
the
president
incidentally
only
testified
that
he
received
one
personally.
he
did
not
see
it
hand
it
to
anyone
else.
jones
himself
mentioned
that
he
offered
one
to
the
president
of
the
student
body,
who
didn't
want
it.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
the
confusion
of
the
pagination
i
believe
your
honor
i
suppose
from
the
inclusion
in
the
appendix
of
the
student
handbook
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
--
which
runs
from
a
177
to
a
178,
but
takes
some
seventy
odd
pages
to
do
it.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
upper
right
hand
corner
yes
sir
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
also
at
the
disciplinary
hearing,
there
was
no
evidence
presented
whatsoever
of
disruption
of
the
campus,
eminent
disruption,
proposed
disruption,
suspicion
to
disruption,
possible
disruption,
none,
it
was
just
not
coming
for
it.
at
the
hearing
in
the
district
court,
there
was
no
evidence
of
actual
disruption.
the
only
evidence
of
possible
or
prospective
disruption
was
the
president
of
the
university
is,
you
know
to
use
the
phrase
vague
and
undifferentiated
fear
just
been
taken.
he
referred
that
as
inflammatory,
get
students
all
stirred
up,
talking
about
other
things.
oh,
there
was
one
other
bit
of
testimony
on
that,
the
dean
of
students
objected
that
the
students
received
the
leaflet
as
they're
walking
across
the
campus,
they
would
stop
and
read
it.
and
the
case,
the
disciplinary
action
was
not
taken
until
at
least
one
month
after
the
leaflet
was
handed
out,
so
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
we
really
need
to
rely
on
forecasts.
the
idea
of
whether
the
--
on
first
issue,
whether
the
void
for
vagueness
doctrine
should
apply
on
the
campus,
i
believe
is
aptly
covered
on
the
brief.
i
will
only
mention
here
that
it
just
seemed
inconceivable
that
it
shouldn't.
it
seems
much
more
reasonable
to
me
to
apply
it
there
where
you
got
the
people
thinking
about
things,
erudite,
literally,
scholarly,
talented,
to
write
rules
than
in
the
small
towns
that
are
held
so
rigidly
to
first
amendment
standards
as
specificity
in
drafting
their
ordinances.
as
to
what
the
standard
might
be,
i
think
the
same
approach
as
was
taken
in
dombrowski
v.
pfister.
dombrowski
referred
to
the
loyalty
oath
cases
as
setting
forth
an
appropriate
standard
for
other
contexts.
this
is
really
not
much
of
a
different
context
though
because
we're
still
on
the
campus,
at
least
not
that
much
of
a
different
context.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
they
have
considerably
greater
effect
on
those
who
must
live
by
them
than
say
it's
on
the
conduct
statute
which
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
your
honor,
they
--
i
would
hope
they
would
give
them
more
detailed
attention
if
they're
rewriting
them
today.
this
hope
will
be
one
result
of
this
case.
the
regulations
were
revised
every
year
though.
there
were
quite
current
at
the
time
in
1967
and
some
of
the
regulations
involved
on
the
procedures
followed
by
the
disciplinary
committee
had
been
rewritten
that
very
year.
the
regulations
were
rewritten
immediately
after
this
case
was
brought.
i
do
not
know
what
the
result
is;
perhaps
the
opposing
counsel
can
help
us
on
that.
and
whether
we're
talking
about
the
facial
or
applicatory
constitutionality
of
this
situation,
i
think
the
case
does
have
to
be
considered
in
light
of
what
the
university
is
first
and
it
is
considerably
more
than
just
a
group
of
scholars
and
learners
and
second,
in
light
of
what
is
happening
in
universities
today
and
as
obviously,
there
is
much
unrest.
various
authorities
have
attributed
this
to
the
failure
to
extend
constitutional
rights
in
the
universities.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
we
should
also
consider
that
this
university,
tennessee
state
university
as
is
true
with
so
many
of
the
smaller
universities,
state
universities
around
the
nation,
trains
a
lot
of
teachers.
and
as
this
court
has
recognized
for
many
years,
in
the
mclaurin
v.
oklahoma,
the
training
someone
to
be
a
leader
and
trainer
of
others.
i
rather
say
that
they're
educating
someone
to
be
a
leader
and
educator
of
others,
but
i
think
it's
more
accurately
stated
the
first
way.
and
further
that
those
who
will
come
under
his
guidance
and
influence
must
be
directly
effected
by
the
education
he
receives.
education
that
the
students
of
tennessee
state
university
are
receiving
is
not
one
calculated
to
make
things
sensitive
to
the
demands
of
the
bill
of
rights.
i
think
this
statement
is
accurate
with
regard
to
other
state
universities,
like
these
another
one
before
the
court
right
now
in
the
record
of
norton
versus
disciplinary
committee
of
east
tennessee
state
university,
petition
for
certiorari
filed
approximately
a
month
ago.
and
it's
our
position
that
the
full
first
amendment
canopy
of
rights
should
apply,
in
fact,
must
apply
to
students.
it
has,
as
many
student
case,
in
this
case,
a
college
student
case
on
his
rights
in
this
court
for
many
years,
i
think
it's
appropriate
in
this
case
to
state
that
henceforth
when
they
come,
the
issue
will
be
whether
or
not
the
first
amendment
has
been
violated
and
will
be
treated
in
the
same
terms
as
if
it
were
a
non-student
case.
the
tests
under
the
first
amendment
would
be
quite
ample,
either
for
vagueness
overbreadth
or
for
the
actual
activity,
ample
to
deal
with
problems
on
the
campus
and
no
toe-test
of
preparing
a
group
for
violent
or
lawless
or
destructive
or
disruptive
action
and
stimulant
to
that
action
is
necessary
before
speech
can
be
curtailed
of
the
brandenburg,
whitney,
(inaudible)
test
eminent
lawless
action
must
be
there.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
in
other
words
that
they
would
be
--
that
those
words
would
be
disrespectful.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i
think
a
direct
insult
would
generally
be
considered
disrespectful.
now,
the
first
amendment
voidness
doctrines
do
not
look
to
the
specific
conduct
involved
where
over
breadth
is
involved.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i
have
never
observed
a
university
yet
in
which
people
functioned
without
friction,
without
conflict
with
each
other,
but
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
well,
even
when
i
went
to
and
quite
times
10
to
15
years
ago
was
there,
but
more
basically,
the
reason
for
times
v.
sullivan
was
the
first
amendment
and
the
reason
a
person
under
times
v.
sullivan
can
call
one
a
racist
pig
or
liar
or
whatever
it
was
is
the
first
amendment.
and
that
fact
that
it
was
a
libel
case,
simply
a
fact
of
the
case,
as
the
fact
that
this
is
a
student
case
is
simply
a
fact
of
the
case,
we're
relying
on
the
first
amendment.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
we
do
--
no
and
we
don't
contend
and
it
is
not
contended
generally.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
certainly
and
we
do
not
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
--
but
we're
talking
about
outdoors
on
the
campus.
we're
not
talking
about
inside
the
classroom.
we're
not
talking
about
inside
the
court
room.
the
first
amendment
in
its
prevalence,
in
its
prevailing
does
take
into
account
the
circumstances.
and
if
i
should
do
that
here,
this
is
quite
different
from
my
writing
it
down
and
hanging
out
on
the
street.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i
have
such
a
difficult
time
conceiving
myself
writing
it
in
the
brief.
[attempt
to
laughter]
but
if
the
standard
rules
against
scandalous
and
impertinent
matter
in
pleadings
and
briefs
would
apply,
and
i
should
think
it
should
be
stricken
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
not
any
different
from
say
the
city
could
have
it
on
the
streets.
we're
not
talking
about
inside
the
classrooms
in
the
same
sense
that
the
city
when
it
passes
ordinances
is
not
talking
about
in
offices.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
yes.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i
really
don't
know
your
honor.
i
would
--
my
first
assumption
would
be
if
it
will
be
written,
it
would
be
immediately
stricken
with
a
rather
harsh
reprimand.
if
it
happened
orally,
i
don't
know.
and
on
the
third
of
the
issues
involved,
the
composition
of
the
disciplinary
committee,
the
issue
illustrates
a
point
that
runs
throughout
the
case.
the
treatment
of
the
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
same
court
below
including
one
of
the
same
judges
on
the
panel,
says
several
years
ago,
the
case
for
the
american
sinemet
case
cited
in
our
brief
on
confusion
of
functions
and
presumptive
bias,
not
actual
bias,
which
would
seem
to
apply
right
down
the
line
here.
it
was
not
even
mentioned
in
opinion,
although
the
issue
was
amply
raised
and
case
cited.
here,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
panel
was
just
these
students.
the
sole
witness
for
the
panel
was
the
reviewing
authority
with
absolutely
empower
what
the
panel
did,
or
the
only
essential
witness.
he
appointed
the
panel.
one
of
the
other
panel
members
has
strong
personal
feelings
about
the
person
involved,
not
about
the
issue,
that
would
not
be
a
disqualifying
matter,
but
about
the
person
involved.
the
student
personnel
committee
overlapped
with
the
disciplinary
committee,
therefore,
it
had
done
much
investigation.
the
dean
of
students,
chairman
of
the
committee
had
compiled
a
list
and
investigate
it.
in
fact,
the
advisory
committee
conducted
an
in-depth
investigation
itself
of
the
students.
they
drew
the
charges,
they
counseled
the
students,
it
called
the
witnesses
and
it
presented
documentary
evidence
and
did
not
even
follow
its
own
rules
as
to
how
the
matters
should
have
been
handled.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i'll
save
the
remaining
time
for
the
rebuttal
if
i
may?
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
those
two
convictions
are
to
be
considered,
we
have
to
reopen
the
entire
disciplinary
procedures.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
they
are
mentioned
at
several
places
in
the
record
your
honor,
page
48
for
example
and
various
other
places.
the
sequence
on
that
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
certainly.
he
was
convicted
and
it
was
on
appeal
at
the
time
the
hearing
was
going
on
there.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
it
was
a
part
of
the
charge
against
it.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
there
was
no
conviction
so
to
speak
of
the
faculty
advisory
committee
on
these
charges.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
issues
in
the
case
your
honor,
i
doubt
it.
if
i
would
to
argue
that
point,
if
i
thought
the
point
were
in
the
case
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
the
rule
on
being
convicted
of
being
the
city
to
council
leads
to
federal
offense.
i
don't
think
it
does
because
it
was
not
filed,
it
was
on
appeal.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
it
was
not,
the
conviction
was
not
found.
the
cases
were
on
appeal
at
the
time
of
these
procedures.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
yes
it
does,
i
believe
your
honor
at
page
48.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i
don't
know
your
honor.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
no
i
don't
--
see
this
issue
has
really
not
been
in
the
case
throughout
any
of
the
lower
courts
because
the
faculty
advisory
committee
exonerated
him
on
these
charges.
he
was
not
dismissed
for
school
for
having
violated
that
particular
rule.
the
chairman
of
the
committee
so
testified,
the
charges
make
no
mention
about
it.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
well,
they
did
not
dismiss
him
from
school
for
that
charge.
they're
up
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
possibly
so.
they
were
half
a
dozen
charges
against
him
and
of
the
three
students
involved
in
the
whole
thing,
there
were
about
18
charges
and
there
were
only
findings
of
shall
we
said
guilt
on
a
smaller
number
of
these
charges.
we
assumed,
it
has
been
assumed
up
to
this
level
always
with
the
case
that
if
faculty
advisory
committee
did
not
make
a
finding
that
a
student
had
done
what
--
on
a
particular
charge,
then,
they
were
not
disciplining
him
for
it.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
off
the
campus,
totally
unrelated
to
campus.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
it
depends
on
the
conduct
your
honor.
this
particular
conduct,
i
would
say
not.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
as
i
recall
the
facts
of
the
case,
there
are
not
of
record,
it
was
an
argument
with
a
police
officer,
leaves
us
vagrancy
and
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
just
an
argument.
he's
coming
out
of
his
house.
he
was
well-known
around
town,
was
unpopular.
he
was
arrested
on
one
of
these
general
dragnet
laws
and
i'm
talking
outside
the
record
because
this
was
--
this
point
would
have
developed,
had
it
been
in
the
case
at
the
time
but
was
not.
the
vagrancy
statute
in
tennessee
in
which
he
was
arrested
has
since
been
declared
unconstitutional.
and
that
disorderly
conduct
statute
is
similar
to
the
one
under
consideration
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
gunn
versus
the
university
committee.
so
this
particular
conviction
would
probably
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
roberts
says
--
he
mentioned
that
the
handing
out
of
this
leaflet
falls
around
by
couple
of
weeks;
that
is
not
true.
he
mentioned
that
mr.
jones
had
already
been
suspended
at
the
time
he
handed
out
the
offending
leaflet.
the
suspension
was
clearly
unconstitutional
on
any
of
the
lower
court
decisions
on
student's
rights
and
with
no
notice,
no
hearing,
no
nothing,
and
ultimately,
it
was
rescinded.
he
was
suspended
on
three
vague
charges,
none
of
which
were
pressed
later
on
in
these
proceedings.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
that's
right
your
honor.
in
dealing
with
the
case,
we
have
given
the
benefit
of
the
ambiguity
to
the
university
and
assume
that
it
was
about
the
literature.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
if
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
if
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
yes,
and
if
there
are
other
ways
we
would
say
that
due
process
has
been
violated,
because
the
man
has
not
been
told
what
he
is
being
disciplined
for?
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
yes,
but
not
convicted,
not
disciplined
for
it,
not
told
that
he
had
been
found
guilty
of
it.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
issue
is
in
case
your
honor.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
they
never
charged
him
for
telling
falsehood.
they
never
even
gave
him
a
chance
to
say
i
didn't
tell
a
falsehood.
they
just
came
down
one
day
and
said
you
lied,
you're
gone.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
it's
just
to
analogize
to
the
outside
world,
it
would
a
perjury
proceeding.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
not
all
your
honor,
i
think
at
that
the
very
least
notice
an
opportunity
to
defend
has
been
settled
ever
although
this
court
has
not
direct
to
pass
on
it,
it
has
been
considered
to
be
settled
since
the
dixon
case
in
1961
or
1962.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
not
at
all
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i'm
arguing
that
if
he
deliberately
--
if
he
is
thought
to
have
deliberately
falsified
something,
they
should
charge
him
with
that
and
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
at
least
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
i
don't
think
the
law
has
been
so
for
the
last
six
great
years,
although
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
excuse
me?
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
starting
with
dixon
versus
alabama
state
board
of
education,
knight
versus
state
board
of
education.
probably,
i
would
say
30
or
40
disciplinary
cases
in
the
meantime
ending
most
recently
or
more
recently
was
cagen
versus
lincoln
memorial
university,
western
district
of
wisconsin.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
none
of
those
in
this
court
your
honor.
a
number
of
them
approved
in
a
footnote
in
tinker,
cited
approvingly
in
the
footnote
in
tinker.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
the
cafeteria
worker
testified
at
his
hearing
in
his
presence
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
mr.
jones?
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
yes.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
yes,
and
he
was
brought
out
that
she
was
testifying
that
the
leaflet
was
handed
out
three
months
before
it
was
prepared,
so
that
the
testimony
was
rendered
wholly
incredible.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
he
testified.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
he
was
cross
examined.
it
appears
in
the
record
at
page
154.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
he
had
never
--
it
was
not
a
basis
for
the
discipline
to
anyone's
knowledge
until
the
findings
came
out
some
10
days
after
period.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
your
honor,
the
next
event
at
the
hearing
after
the
president
testified
was
mr.
jones'
testimony.
his
testimony
contradicted
that
of
the
president
and
it
simply
mr.
jones,
we
presumed
thought
he
was
telling
the
truth.
he
asserted
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
all
necessary
your
honor.
i
think
every
examination
of
credibility
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
and
when
the
--
yes,
and
when
the
question
is
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i
don't
think
a
man
can
be
disciplined
for
defending
himself.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
the
essence
is
if
he's
accused
of
lying,
he
should
have
the
chance
to
prove
that
whether
he
was
or
not.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
it's
a
state
university
for
negroes.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
a
state
university
for
negroes
since
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
by
terms
of
the
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
largely,
roughly
80%
negro
i
think,
it
has
since
been
put
under
desegregation
plan.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
he
was
negro.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
associate
justices.
this
case
concerns
a
college
student,
not
a
school
child,
a
college
student,
who
was
dismissed
from
state
university
for
handing
out
one
leaflet
on
the
campus
not
in
or
about
any
classroom.
the
issues
break
down
into
four.
the
regulations
involved
prohibit
disrespect
for
authority
and
any
other
conduct
requiring
severe
discipline.
we
contend
that
these
are
void
for
vagueness
and
over
over
breadth,
primarily
our
first
amendment
contention,
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
notice
is
also
subsumed
in
the
question.
next,
we
contend
simply
that
they
are
void
as
applied,
you
cannot
outlaw
the
distribution
of
literature
or
more
specific
to
this
case
put
somebody
out
of
school
for
it.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
three
in
this
package
your
honor.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
certiorari
was
denied
as
to
the
other
two.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
three
--
the
four
issues,
three
of
the
four
issues
were
identical
to
all
three
petitioners.
the
factual
issue
varied
as
to
each
of
the
three.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
you
do
not
have
to
your
honor.
in
some
cases,
it's
done
for
example
auburn
v.
laurie
(ph)
held
the
georgia
statute
both
--
unconstitutional
both
on
its
face
and
as
applied.
there
is
no
choice
between
the
two
issues
--
between
the
two
approaches
on
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
that's
right
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
that
in
the
way
the
first
amendment
litigation
is
going
nowadays,
so
many
dombrowski
type
actions,
it
--
the
first
point
of
reference
is
more
often
the
facial
unconstitutionality
rather
than
the
applicatory.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
yes.
it's
plaintiff's
exhibit
six
which
appears
at
page
175
of
the
record.
and
the
other
two
issues
involved
are
due
process
issues,
one
having
to
do
with
the
composition
of
panel
and
its
conduct.
in
fact,
the
advisory
committee
that
is
the
university
disciplinary
committee,
its
confusion
of
functions
being
essentially
everything
and
therefore
inherently
biased,
presumptively
biased.
and
i
think
in
this
case
also
biased
as
a
matter
of
proof.
and
fourth,
procedural
due
process
time
and
type
of
notice
and
in
fact
that
a
new
contention
was
brought
in
at
the
hearing,
they
found
without
ever
bringing
it
up
at
the
hearing,
the
hearing
of
the
--
in
fact,
the
advisory
committee's
findings
said
that
the
student
had
not
told
the
truth
at
the
hearing,
of
course,
he
never
had
the
chance
to
rebut
this.
the
facts
on
the
leafleting
issue
are
very
brief.
he
handed
it.
he
was
found
to
have
handed
out,
that's
plaintiff's
exhibit
six
although
there
is
considerable
doubt
whether
he
actually
did
hand
it
out
or
not,
hand
it
to
the
president
of
the
university.
the
president
was
the
only
solid
witness
on
this
point.
one
other
witness
testified
that
she
saw
him
hand
it
out
in
the
cafeteria.
however,
she
testified
that
she
saw
him
do
this
some
two,
three
or
four
months
before
the
leaflet
was
prepared.
so,
we
assumed
that
there
is
only
witness
against
him,
the
president
of
the
university
and
the
president
incidentally
only
testified
that
he
received
one
personally.
he
did
not
see
it
hand
it
to
anyone
else.
jones
himself
mentioned
that
he
offered
one
to
the
president
of
the
student
body,
who
didn't
want
it.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
the
confusion
of
the
pagination
i
believe
your
honor
i
suppose
from
the
inclusion
in
the
appendix
of
the
student
handbook
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
--
which
runs
from
a
177
to
a
178,
but
takes
some
seventy
odd
pages
to
do
it.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
upper
right
hand
corner
yes
sir
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
also
at
the
disciplinary
hearing,
there
was
no
evidence
presented
whatsoever
of
disruption
of
the
campus,
eminent
disruption,
proposed
disruption,
suspicion
to
disruption,
possible
disruption,
none,
it
was
just
not
coming
for
it.
at
the
hearing
in
the
district
court,
there
was
no
evidence
of
actual
disruption.
the
only
evidence
of
possible
or
prospective
disruption
was
the
president
of
the
university
is,
you
know
to
use
the
phrase
vague
and
undifferentiated
fear
just
been
taken.
he
referred
that
as
inflammatory,
get
students
all
stirred
up,
talking
about
other
things.
oh,
there
was
one
other
bit
of
testimony
on
that,
the
dean
of
students
objected
that
the
students
received
the
leaflet
as
they're
walking
across
the
campus,
they
would
stop
and
read
it.
and
the
case,
the
disciplinary
action
was
not
taken
until
at
least
one
month
after
the
leaflet
was
handed
out,
so
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
we
really
need
to
rely
on
forecasts.
the
idea
of
whether
the
--
on
first
issue,
whether
the
void
for
vagueness
doctrine
should
apply
on
the
campus,
i
believe
is
aptly
covered
on
the
brief.
i
will
only
mention
here
that
it
just
seemed
inconceivable
that
it
shouldn't.
it
seems
much
more
reasonable
to
me
to
apply
it
there
where
you
got
the
people
thinking
about
things,
erudite,
literally,
scholarly,
talented,
to
write
rules
than
in
the
small
towns
that
are
held
so
rigidly
to
first
amendment
standards
as
specificity
in
drafting
their
ordinances.
as
to
what
the
standard
might
be,
i
think
the
same
approach
as
was
taken
in
dombrowski
v.
pfister.
dombrowski
referred
to
the
loyalty
oath
cases
as
setting
forth
an
appropriate
standard
for
other
contexts.
this
is
really
not
much
of
a
different
context
though
because
we're
still
on
the
campus,
at
least
not
that
much
of
a
different
context.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
they
have
considerably
greater
effect
on
those
who
must
live
by
them
than
say
it's
on
the
conduct
statute
which
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
your
honor,
they
--
i
would
hope
they
would
give
them
more
detailed
attention
if
they're
rewriting
them
today.
this
hope
will
be
one
result
of
this
case.
the
regulations
were
revised
every
year
though.
there
were
quite
current
at
the
time
in
1967
and
some
of
the
regulations
involved
on
the
procedures
followed
by
the
disciplinary
committee
had
been
rewritten
that
very
year.
the
regulations
were
rewritten
immediately
after
this
case
was
brought.
i
do
not
know
what
the
result
is;
perhaps
the
opposing
counsel
can
help
us
on
that.
and
whether
we're
talking
about
the
facial
or
applicatory
constitutionality
of
this
situation,
i
think
the
case
does
have
to
be
considered
in
light
of
what
the
university
is
first
and
it
is
considerably
more
than
just
a
group
of
scholars
and
learners
and
second,
in
light
of
what
is
happening
in
universities
today
and
as
obviously,
there
is
much
unrest.
various
authorities
have
attributed
this
to
the
failure
to
extend
constitutional
rights
in
the
universities.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
we
should
also
consider
that
this
university,
tennessee
state
university
as
is
true
with
so
many
of
the
smaller
universities,
state
universities
around
the
nation,
trains
a
lot
of
teachers.
and
as
this
court
has
recognized
for
many
years,
in
the
mclaurin
v.
oklahoma,
the
training
someone
to
be
a
leader
and
trainer
of
others.
i
rather
say
that
they're
educating
someone
to
be
a
leader
and
educator
of
others,
but
i
think
it's
more
accurately
stated
the
first
way.
and
further
that
those
who
will
come
under
his
guidance
and
influence
must
be
directly
effected
by
the
education
he
receives.
education
that
the
students
of
tennessee
state
university
are
receiving
is
not
one
calculated
to
make
things
sensitive
to
the
demands
of
the
bill
of
rights.
i
think
this
statement
is
accurate
with
regard
to
other
state
universities,
like
these
another
one
before
the
court
right
now
in
the
record
of
norton
versus
disciplinary
committee
of
east
tennessee
state
university,
petition
for
certiorari
filed
approximately
a
month
ago.
and
it's
our
position
that
the
full
first
amendment
canopy
of
rights
should
apply,
in
fact,
must
apply
to
students.
it
has,
as
many
student
case,
in
this
case,
a
college
student
case
on
his
rights
in
this
court
for
many
years,
i
think
it's
appropriate
in
this
case
to
state
that
henceforth
when
they
come,
the
issue
will
be
whether
or
not
the
first
amendment
has
been
violated
and
will
be
treated
in
the
same
terms
as
if
it
were
a
non-student
case.
the
tests
under
the
first
amendment
would
be
quite
ample,
either
for
vagueness
overbreadth
or
for
the
actual
activity,
ample
to
deal
with
problems
on
the
campus
and
no
toe-test
of
preparing
a
group
for
violent
or
lawless
or
destructive
or
disruptive
action
and
stimulant
to
that
action
is
necessary
before
speech
can
be
curtailed
of
the
brandenburg,
whitney,
(inaudible)
test
eminent
lawless
action
must
be
there.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
in
other
words
that
they
would
be
--
that
those
words
would
be
disrespectful.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i
think
a
direct
insult
would
generally
be
considered
disrespectful.
now,
the
first
amendment
voidness
doctrines
do
not
look
to
the
specific
conduct
involved
where
over
breadth
is
involved.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i
have
never
observed
a
university
yet
in
which
people
functioned
without
friction,
without
conflict
with
each
other,
but
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
well,
even
when
i
went
to
and
quite
times
10
to
15
years
ago
was
there,
but
more
basically,
the
reason
for
times
v.
sullivan
was
the
first
amendment
and
the
reason
a
person
under
times
v.
sullivan
can
call
one
a
racist
pig
or
liar
or
whatever
it
was
is
the
first
amendment.
and
that
fact
that
it
was
a
libel
case,
simply
a
fact
of
the
case,
as
the
fact
that
this
is
a
student
case
is
simply
a
fact
of
the
case,
we're
relying
on
the
first
amendment.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
we
do
--
no
and
we
don't
contend
and
it
is
not
contended
generally.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
certainly
and
we
do
not
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
--
but
we're
talking
about
outdoors
on
the
campus.
we're
not
talking
about
inside
the
classroom.
we're
not
talking
about
inside
the
court
room.
the
first
amendment
in
its
prevalence,
in
its
prevailing
does
take
into
account
the
circumstances.
and
if
i
should
do
that
here,
this
is
quite
different
from
my
writing
it
down
and
hanging
out
on
the
street.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i
have
such
a
difficult
time
conceiving
myself
writing
it
in
the
brief.
[attempt
to
laughter]
but
if
the
standard
rules
against
scandalous
and
impertinent
matter
in
pleadings
and
briefs
would
apply,
and
i
should
think
it
should
be
stricken
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
not
any
different
from
say
the
city
could
have
it
on
the
streets.
we're
not
talking
about
inside
the
classrooms
in
the
same
sense
that
the
city
when
it
passes
ordinances
is
not
talking
about
in
offices.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
yes.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i
really
don't
know
your
honor.
i
would
--
my
first
assumption
would
be
if
it
will
be
written,
it
would
be
immediately
stricken
with
a
rather
harsh
reprimand.
if
it
happened
orally,
i
don't
know.
and
on
the
third
of
the
issues
involved,
the
composition
of
the
disciplinary
committee,
the
issue
illustrates
a
point
that
runs
throughout
the
case.
the
treatment
of
the
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
same
court
below
including
one
of
the
same
judges
on
the
panel,
says
several
years
ago,
the
case
for
the
american
sinemet
case
cited
in
our
brief
on
confusion
of
functions
and
presumptive
bias,
not
actual
bias,
which
would
seem
to
apply
right
down
the
line
here.
it
was
not
even
mentioned
in
opinion,
although
the
issue
was
amply
raised
and
case
cited.
here,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
panel
was
just
these
students.
the
sole
witness
for
the
panel
was
the
reviewing
authority
with
absolutely
empower
what
the
panel
did,
or
the
only
essential
witness.
he
appointed
the
panel.
one
of
the
other
panel
members
has
strong
personal
feelings
about
the
person
involved,
not
about
the
issue,
that
would
not
be
a
disqualifying
matter,
but
about
the
person
involved.
the
student
personnel
committee
overlapped
with
the
disciplinary
committee,
therefore,
it
had
done
much
investigation.
the
dean
of
students,
chairman
of
the
committee
had
compiled
a
list
and
investigate
it.
in
fact,
the
advisory
committee
conducted
an
in-depth
investigation
itself
of
the
students.
they
drew
the
charges,
they
counseled
the
students,
it
called
the
witnesses
and
it
presented
documentary
evidence
and
did
not
even
follow
its
own
rules
as
to
how
the
matters
should
have
been
handled.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i'll
save
the
remaining
time
for
the
rebuttal
if
i
may?
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
those
two
convictions
are
to
be
considered,
we
have
to
reopen
the
entire
disciplinary
procedures.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
they
are
mentioned
at
several
places
in
the
record
your
honor,
page
48
for
example
and
various
other
places.
the
sequence
on
that
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
certainly.
he
was
convicted
and
it
was
on
appeal
at
the
time
the
hearing
was
going
on
there.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
it
was
a
part
of
the
charge
against
it.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
there
was
no
conviction
so
to
speak
of
the
faculty
advisory
committee
on
these
charges.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
issues
in
the
case
your
honor,
i
doubt
it.
if
i
would
to
argue
that
point,
if
i
thought
the
point
were
in
the
case
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
the
rule
on
being
convicted
of
being
the
city
to
council
leads
to
federal
offense.
i
don't
think
it
does
because
it
was
not
filed,
it
was
on
appeal.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
it
was
not,
the
conviction
was
not
found.
the
cases
were
on
appeal
at
the
time
of
these
procedures.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
yes
it
does,
i
believe
your
honor
at
page
48.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i
don't
know
your
honor.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
no
i
don't
--
see
this
issue
has
really
not
been
in
the
case
throughout
any
of
the
lower
courts
because
the
faculty
advisory
committee
exonerated
him
on
these
charges.
he
was
not
dismissed
for
school
for
having
violated
that
particular
rule.
the
chairman
of
the
committee
so
testified,
the
charges
make
no
mention
about
it.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
well,
they
did
not
dismiss
him
from
school
for
that
charge.
they're
up
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
possibly
so.
they
were
half
a
dozen
charges
against
him
and
of
the
three
students
involved
in
the
whole
thing,
there
were
about
18
charges
and
there
were
only
findings
of
shall
we
said
guilt
on
a
smaller
number
of
these
charges.
we
assumed,
it
has
been
assumed
up
to
this
level
always
with
the
case
that
if
faculty
advisory
committee
did
not
make
a
finding
that
a
student
had
done
what
--
on
a
particular
charge,
then,
they
were
not
disciplining
him
for
it.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
off
the
campus,
totally
unrelated
to
campus.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
it
depends
on
the
conduct
your
honor.
this
particular
conduct,
i
would
say
not.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
as
i
recall
the
facts
of
the
case,
there
are
not
of
record,
it
was
an
argument
with
a
police
officer,
leaves
us
vagrancy
and
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
just
an
argument.
he's
coming
out
of
his
house.
he
was
well-known
around
town,
was
unpopular.
he
was
arrested
on
one
of
these
general
dragnet
laws
and
i'm
talking
outside
the
record
because
this
was
--
this
point
would
have
developed,
had
it
been
in
the
case
at
the
time
but
was
not.
the
vagrancy
statute
in
tennessee
in
which
he
was
arrested
has
since
been
declared
unconstitutional.
and
that
disorderly
conduct
statute
is
similar
to
the
one
under
consideration
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
gunn
versus
the
university
committee.
so
this
particular
conviction
would
probably
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
roberts
says
--
he
mentioned
that
the
handing
out
of
this
leaflet
falls
around
by
couple
of
weeks;
that
is
not
true.
he
mentioned
that
mr.
jones
had
already
been
suspended
at
the
time
he
handed
out
the
offending
leaflet.
the
suspension
was
clearly
unconstitutional
on
any
of
the
lower
court
decisions
on
student's
rights
and
with
no
notice,
no
hearing,
no
nothing,
and
ultimately,
it
was
rescinded.
he
was
suspended
on
three
vague
charges,
none
of
which
were
pressed
later
on
in
these
proceedings.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
that's
right
your
honor.
in
dealing
with
the
case,
we
have
given
the
benefit
of
the
ambiguity
to
the
university
and
assume
that
it
was
about
the
literature.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
if
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
if
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
yes,
and
if
there
are
other
ways
we
would
say
that
due
process
has
been
violated,
because
the
man
has
not
been
told
what
he
is
being
disciplined
for?
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
yes,
but
not
convicted,
not
disciplined
for
it,
not
told
that
he
had
been
found
guilty
of
it.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
issue
is
in
case
your
honor.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
they
never
charged
him
for
telling
falsehood.
they
never
even
gave
him
a
chance
to
say
i
didn't
tell
a
falsehood.
they
just
came
down
one
day
and
said
you
lied,
you're
gone.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
it's
just
to
analogize
to
the
outside
world,
it
would
a
perjury
proceeding.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
not
all
your
honor,
i
think
at
that
the
very
least
notice
an
opportunity
to
defend
has
been
settled
ever
although
this
court
has
not
direct
to
pass
on
it,
it
has
been
considered
to
be
settled
since
the
dixon
case
in
1961
or
1962.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
not
at
all
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i'm
arguing
that
if
he
deliberately
--
if
he
is
thought
to
have
deliberately
falsified
something,
they
should
charge
him
with
that
and
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
at
least
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
i
don't
think
the
law
has
been
so
for
the
last
six
great
years,
although
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
excuse
me?
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
starting
with
dixon
versus
alabama
state
board
of
education,
knight
versus
state
board
of
education.
probably,
i
would
say
30
or
40
disciplinary
cases
in
the
meantime
ending
most
recently
or
more
recently
was
cagen
versus
lincoln
memorial
university,
western
district
of
wisconsin.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
none
of
those
in
this
court
your
honor.
a
number
of
them
approved
in
a
footnote
in
tinker,
cited
approvingly
in
the
footnote
in
tinker.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
the
cafeteria
worker
testified
at
his
hearing
in
his
presence
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
mr.
jones?
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
yes.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
yes,
and
he
was
brought
out
that
she
was
testifying
that
the
leaflet
was
handed
out
three
months
before
it
was
prepared,
so
that
the
testimony
was
rendered
wholly
incredible.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
he
testified.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
he
was
cross
examined.
it
appears
in
the
record
at
page
154.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
he
had
never
--
it
was
not
a
basis
for
the
discipline
to
anyone's
knowledge
until
the
findings
came
out
some
10
days
after
period.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
your
honor,
the
next
event
at
the
hearing
after
the
president
testified
was
mr.
jones'
testimony.
his
testimony
contradicted
that
of
the
president
and
it
simply
mr.
jones,
we
presumed
thought
he
was
telling
the
truth.
he
asserted
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
all
necessary
your
honor.
i
think
every
examination
of
credibility
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
and
when
the
--
yes,
and
when
the
question
is
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i
don't
think
a
man
can
be
disciplined
for
defending
himself.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
the
essence
is
if
he's
accused
of
lying,
he
should
have
the
chance
to
prove
that
whether
he
was
or
not.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
it's
a
state
university
for
negroes.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
a
state
university
for
negroes
since
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
by
terms
of
the
--
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
largely,
roughly
80%
negro
i
think,
it
has
since
been
put
under
desegregation
plan.
mr.
reber
f.
boult,
jr.
he
was
negro.
