if
we
agree
with
you,
then
this
distribution
of
leaflets
[inaudible]
we
have
to
reach
the
others,
they
don't
do
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i'm
thinking
particularly
on
the
issue
that
you
--
i
say
you
point
to
the
vagueness,
regulations
whether
we
have
to
reach
that
if
we
in
any
event
a
conduct
conduct
is
[inaudible].
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
rest
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my
difficultly
is
i
would
have
supposed
that
the
discipline
would
have
--
a
committee
would
have
to
rest
the
discipline
on
a
charge
that
he
had
lied
about
it
before
you
could
support
the
discipline
on
the
basis
of
his
lying
about
it,
wouldn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
think
we
do
that
without
making
a
charge
to
that
effect?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
if
you
came
here
in
defense
of
that
charge
and
lied
again,
i
expect
you
have
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
if
that
sentence
of
31
is
at
the
hearing,
he
demonstrated
this
indifference
to
the
two
by
denying
that
he
passed
up
such
literature
despite
positive
statements
by
cafeteria
personal
and
the
president
of
the
university.
maybe
he'd
done
so
and
my
question
is
did
the
cafeteria
personnel
and
the
president
of
the
university
testify
at
his
hearing
in
his
presence
that
he
had
done
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
the
cafeteria
worker
--
was
he
represented
by
counsel
at
the
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
with
that
witness
from
the
cafeteria
cross
examined?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
the
president
of
the
university,
he
testified
at
his
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
was
he
cross
examined?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
i
don't
quite
understand
your
point
that
the
charge
was
not
or
the
fact
of
his
lying
or
allegation
that
he
would
have
lied.
as
i
gather,
your
point
is
that
that
was
not
a
basis
for
the
discipline
that
was
imposed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
was
surely,
he
must
have
known
that
the
hearing
itself
that
the
issue
of
his
veracity
was
in
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
finding
--
the
finding
of
the
committee
was
that
we
have
no
doubt
that
the
student
did
not
tell
the
truth.
so,
as
between
his
testimony
and
that
of
the
president
and
the
cafeteria
worker,
at
least
this
committee
resolved
the
question
against
the
jones,
didn't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
suggest
that
was
not
a
basis
for
its
action
in
imposing
discipline?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
we
agree
