mr.
robert
h.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
--
associate
justices.
i
want
to
first
take
care
a
little
matter
of
the
reply
brief.
it
was
made
in
my
brief
in
which
it
alleged
that
i
had
made
some
erroneous
statements.
only
two
points
that
i
want
to
raise
in
connection
to
that.
one
is
to
the
effect
that
i
have
left
the
impression
at
least
that
the
leafleting
activity
that
this
petitioner
has
been
charged
with
and
found
guilty
of
was
connected
in
some
way
with
the
arrival
on
the
campus,
mr.
carmichael
when
ensuing
riot
that
occurred.
i
am
wrong
about
that
and
i
apologize
to
the
court
and
to
opposing
counsel.
there
had
been
a
number
of
leaflets
passed
out
at
about
this
time
and
some
of
them
before
and
that
some
after
the
riot
occurred
down
the
campus
in
the
summer
of
1967.
there
was
one
of
them
for
instance
that
demanded
that
the
administration
invite
mr.
carmichael
there.
they
later
did
and
the
riot
did
result.
however,
this
particular
leaflet
which
advocated
and
urged
the
student
body
to
boycott
registration
at
the
school
was
passed
out
after
the
riot
had
occurred.
now,
the
second
point
that
i
would
make
in
the
reply
brief
is
in
regard
to
the
charge
against
this
petitioner
of
being
in
violation
of
city
county
or
state
laws.
it
is
urged
here
that
by
the
words
of
dr.
payne
who
was
the
dean
of
students
and
who
presided
over
these
hearings
that
he
agreed
that
this
was
not
used
against
the
student
and
the
hearings,.
the
record
will
not
bear
mr.
boult
out
on
that.
i
think
he
has
failed
to
read
the
entire
record
in
regard
to
it.
what
actually
took
place,
mr.
hedgepeth
on
page
12
of
the
transcript
of
the
proceedings
of
the
fac
hearing
made
it
clear
that
we
were,
or
the
school
was
relying
upon
any
disorderly
conduct
or
conduct
unfitting
a
student
or
any
that
violated
the
rule
of
the
handbook
there
at
the
institution.
further
on
and
about
70
to
78,
there
were
about
eight-full
pages
where
it
was
developed
as
to
just
what
mr.
jones
had
been
convicted
of
and
paid
the
fine
in
the
metropolitan
court
iv.
so,
those
are
the
two
points
i
want
to
raise
on
that.
the
--
we
have
made
two
issues
out
of
the
four
that
the
petitioner
had.
we
feel
that
there
only
two
things
involved,
one
is
the
entire
matter
of
the
procedure
including
the
due
process
rights
of
these
petitioners.
as
stated
earlier,
there
were
five
original
petitioners,
two
of
them
were
dismissed
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
i
mean
charges
against
them
were
dismissed.
the
other
three
were
found
guilty
of
acts
that
warranted
their
suspension.
now,
that's
another
thing
that
i
want
to
make
clear
to
the
court
and
that
is
the
fact
that
these
students
were
not
expelled,
they
were
suspended.
they
have
not
--
this
petitioner
has
not
gone
back
to
school
and
sought
readmission
since
the
suspension.
i
don't
know
whether
the
school
would
allow
him
readmittance
or
not.
his
was
an
out
of
state
student
and
he
came
down
there
and
he
did
things
that
they
felt
to
be
and
found
to
be
disruptive.
this
one
piece
of
literature
tried
to
impress
his
will
upon
the
other
students,
for
example
and
calls
them
not
to
register
for
school
and
thereby
disrupt
the
entire
procedure.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
one
thing
else
that
he
did
there
in
connection
with
the
leaflet,
he
lied
about
it.
he
said
that
he
did
not
do
it
despite
of
the
fact
that
the
president
of
the
university
says
he
handed
it
me
one
himself
right
in
front
of
the
administration
building
and
he
had
about
50
of
them
in
his
hands
when
he
did
it.
later
down
in
the
cafeteria
testified
that
if
there
was
some
discrepancy
about
the
date
that
she
claimed
that
it
was
passed
out,
but
she
said
there
wasn't
any
question
in
her
mind
but
that
was
the
piece
of
literature
was.
she
went
over
and
picked
it
up
and
read
it.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
no
sir,
then
the
third
thing
is
that
he
violated
the
rules
of
the
student
handbook
and
that
he
was
convicted
and
fined
in
metropolitan
court
for
two
charges
of
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
sir,
no
sir
and
this
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
no
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir,
they
found
that
he
was
guilty
of
conviction
or
the
committee
found
that
mr.
jones
has
seized
upon
opportunity
on
different
occasions
to
promote
unrest
on
the
campus
with
such
actions
as
distributing
literature
designed
for
the
purpose
--
and
then
at
the
hearing,
he
demonstrate
his
matter
--
over
the
truth
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
considering
all
that
matters
before
this
committee,
we
feel
that
mr.
kenneth
jones
has
violated
the
rules
of
conduct,
governing
students
at
this
end
and
in
the
university
such
an
extent
that
he
should
be
suspended.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
no
sir,
no
more
than
one
of
the
things,
specifically
in
there
and
was
that
if
he
was
found
to
be
in
violation
of
any
state,
county
or
city
or
federal
law
that
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
has
listed
as
being
requiring
sever
discipline.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
no
sir,
he
hadn't
been
charged
with
that
of
course
we
insist
that
he
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir
we
do.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
for
this
reason,
he
--
of
course,
we
think
that
the
notice
required
for
most
things
wouldn't
apply
to
personal
conduct
of
that
kind
which
he
did
knowingly.
he
had
the
first
notice
of
anybody
that
he
was
going
to
be
made
the
resolve
within
himself
to
tell
lie
in
that
committee.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
if
the
court
please,
i
think
it
would
be
somewhat
comparable
to
this.
this
morning,
you
graciously
permitted
me
to
practice
for
this
court.
part
of
what
you
based
that
on
was
on
the
application
that
i
filed.
suppose
that
i
lied
in
that
application
and
you
brought
me
in
here
for
a
hearing
and
to
determine
whether
i
should
have
that
privilege
you
gave
me
revoked
and
while
in
here,
i
openly
and
blatantly
lied
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
well
of
course
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
well
of
course,
i
think
that
it
really
becomes
moot
anyway
if
you'll
recall
that
after
this
hearing
and
he
certainly
had
notice
at
that
time
about
it
and
was
accused
of
lying
to
them,
we
had
a
full
rest
court
hearing
in
the
us
district
court
in
middle
tennessee
and
imagine
and
judge
miller
agreed
of
course
with
the
university
officials
in
connection
with
all
of
these
things
that
they
found
against
him.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir,
i
certainly
do.
now,
mr.
jones
claimed
that
he
only
passed
up
some
other
leaflets,
one
of
them
i
think
was
called
the
black
thesis
which
was
more
or
less
philosophical
piece
of
writing.
now,
that
wasn't
so
far
as
i
can
see
anything
in
there
that
would
have
been
disruptive.
but
suppose
had
been
able
to
persuade
even
a
substantial
number
of
these
students
to
refuse
to
register
when
the
term
started,
certainly
that
would
disrupt
the
school
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
it
was
approximately
a
month-and-a-half.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
no.
but
they
stopped
in
course.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
--
they
didn't
permit
him
to
go
that
summer.
this
happened
during
the
summer
and
they'd
already
sent
him
notice
that
he
had
not
been
cleared
for
attendance
here
on
the
summer
term
of
school.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
those
were
it
didn't
turn
out
that
way,
but
i
don't
think
that
you
have
to
wait
till
the
horse
is
out
of
the
barn
before
you
are
allowed
to
close
the
door.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
the
charge
itself
charged
in
with
him
and
they
readily
admitted
it
and
they
are
on
page
70
to
78.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
well,
it's
in
my
brief
on
page
5,
but
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
and
the
entire
discussion
about
the
criminal
activity
that
he
was
charged
with
takes
place
on
between
pages
and
70
and
78
of
the
transcript
of
the
fac
here
as
also
of
course
in
the
transcript
of
the
court
hearing
before
the
judge
miller.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
no
sir.
we
had
the
part
of
the
record,
though
here
is
the
fac
transcript
of
the
hearing.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
--
no
sir
ti
should
be,
it's
on
page
48
of
here.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
of
course
we
feel
that
the
most
serious
thing
that
took
place
was
the
matter
of
this
leaflet
which
he
attempted
to
disrupt
orderly
activities
of
the
school
and
even
in
tinker
it
was
stated
clear
that
the
orderly
activities
of
the
school
is
not
subject
to
first
amendment
rights.
we
think
that
registration
certainly
is
an
orderly
and
part
of
the
record
functions
on
school.
my
time
is
expired.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
conclude
argument
for
the
respondents
in
this
manner.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
an
article
written
by
professor
charles
allen
wright
in
connection
with
speech
to
be
delivered
on
vanderbilt
university
campus
on
october
1969
entitled
“the
constitution
on
the
campus.”
this
is
one
of
the
oliver
womble
holm
series
and
i
think
that
it
is
one
of
the
best
written
articles
i
have
ever
read
and
i
recommend
it
to
the
court
if
they
haven't
already
seen
it.
in
it
though,
professor
wright
basically
wound
up
by
saying
that
expression
can
be
restrictive,
if
at
any
time,
if
material
substantially
interferes
with
a
normal
procedures
of
the
university
or
with
the
wraps
of
other.
now,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
basic
issue
involved
here
is
just
the
action
that
this
student
has
been
accused
and
found
guilty
of
committing
based
primarily
under
his
first
amendment
rights.
yesterday
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes,
your
honor.
there
was
a
finding
that
he
had
committed
a
misdemeanor
and
found
guilty
in
court
in
violation
of
the
student
handbook
which
had
been
a
specific
charge
against
him
in
addition.
they
also
found
that
he
lied
to
the
committee
while
before
ti
and
openly
before
it
and
i
might
say
this,
it
is
not
only
just,
he
just
told
the
president
of
the
effect
that
he
was
lying
in
front
of
this
outstanding
faculty
group
and
other
students
and
even
the
press
was
present
when
this
happened
which
compounded
the
disrespect
that
he
showed
to
president
on
this
occasion.
yesterday,
i
had
the
feeling
that
there
was
some
question
in
the
mind
of
perhaps
associate
justice
marshall
in
regard
to
why
this
action
on
the
leafleting
or
the
boycott
literature
didn't
result
in
any
kind
of
a
serious
incident.
i
didn't
called
the
court's
attention
to
this
but
i
would
like
to
do
it
this
time.
mr.
jones
at
the
time
that
he
passed
out
this
leaflet
had
already
been
temporarily
suspended
from
school.
he
was
not
on
the
campus
at
that
time
as
a
student.
when
he
passed
out
this
literature
he
was
awaiting
his
hearing
to
see
whether
or
not
he
would
be
admitted
in
the
full
term
or
not.
this
literature
was
passed
out
on
august
18,
1967
which
according
to
the
calendar
which
you
have
in
the
appendix
in
the
student
handbook
part
of
it
which
begins
on
page
175
of
the
joint
appendix,
a
calendar
of
the
school.
here,
you'll
find
that
this
was
the
last
day
of
final
examinations
for
the
last
term
of
the
summer
quarter.
when
he
did
this,
the
baccalaureate
services
follow
that
by
two
days
and
school
was
out
then
until
the
following
term
started.
that
is
the
reason
there
was
no
more
commotion
following
it.
however,
i
direct
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
was
followed
--
itself
following
by
just
a
couple
of
weeks
or
so,
arrived
on
the
campus
and
tensions
were
high.
now
admittedly,
the
faculty
hasn't
in
it's
findings
written
out
that
as
a
result
of
this
literature
been
passed
out
on
the
final
examination
day
that
john
smith
came
to
him
and
said,
“well,
that
bothers
me
and
i
couldn't
correctly
answer
one
of
the
questions
on
the
examination”
or
anything
like
that,
but
they
found
it
as
a
matter
of
their
interpretation.
they
were
there
on
the
campus.
we're
not
talking
about
some
rural
constable
or
something
like
that
that
might
be
found
in
my
home
county
of
pickett.
we're
talking
about
nine
of
the
outstanding
members
of
the
faculty
on
tennessee
state
university's
campus.
we're
talking
about
the
vice
president
maritus
(ph),
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
faculty
advisory
committee
with
30
some
years
of
experience
there
as
a
school
administrator.
we
are
talking
about
dr.
j.a.
payne
who
acted
because
of
dr.
boswell's
poor
health
as
the
presiding
officer
over
this
faculty
advisory
meeting
with
the
great
many
years
of
experience
on
the
campus
and
as
being
the
students.
we're
talking
about
the
dean
of
women
and
the
dean
of
men.
school
administrators,
practically
all
if
not
all
of
them
hold
doctorate
degrees
and
had
the
combined
experience
of
well
and
in
excess
of
100
years
there
on
the
campus,
that's
who
we're
talking
about,
substituting
the
judgment
on
as
to
what
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
i
should
call
the
events
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir
and
i
think
it
would
be
all
together
a
different
situation.
i
think
you
could
perhaps
of
even
gone
across
the
street
a
little
ways
to
centennial
park
and
got
up
on
a
bench
and
maybe
made
a
speech
on
it
and
it
would
have
been
somewhat
different.
here,
it
is
calculated
to
do
one
thing,
calls
unrest
and
tried
to
prevail
his
ideas
and
his
desires
on
to
the
student
body
there.
he
had
already
been
suspended.
he
--
it
wasn't
a
matter
for
him
not
to
register.
he
was
trying
to
ask
everybody
else
to
join
with
him
because
his
conduct
had
caused
him
to
be
suspended
where
he
wasn't
permitted
to
continue
during
the
summer
quarter
and
was
called
on
them
to
do
so.
now
as
to
the
type
of
thing
that
was
in
this
makes
very
important.
there
was
really
more
to
it
than
just
boycott.
so
far
as
it
being
designed
to
create
unrest
and
we
got
to
keep
in
mind
now
that
this
was
fall
on
a
period
of
great
deal
of
disturbance
on
the
campus
where
property
was
destroyed
and
people
were
injured.
some
of
the
things
that
he
says
for
example
anything
that
give
the
puppets,
i'm
talking
about
school
administrators
now.
that's
a
reference
that
he
makes
to
them.
he
calls
them
puppets
throughout
this.
i
want
to
adapt
civilized
tactics
used
by
the
man
and
that
sort
of
thing.
then
he
goes
on
with
words
like
“does
the
campus
will
become
a
concentration
camp
controlled
and
contained
by
the
legislation
of
the
raciest
dogs'
downtown.”
the
acts
of
the
puppet
administrators
here
at
the
end
referring
to
these
people

whom
he
had
already
been
advised
that
he
was
going
and
have
to
come
and
clearance

he
could
be
re-enrolled.

ultimately
the

of
the
honorable
national

whose
pale
faces
have

we
as
intelligent
black
students
will
not
be
guarded
by
trampling
parialist
idiots
who
call
themselves

now
that's
what
he's
saying
about
the
school
administrators.
he
said
earlier
that
he
came
down
to
tennessee
to
go
to
school
because
he
investigate
and
found
that
it
was
a
great
school
and
he
wanted
to
go
down
there.
yet
in
his
first
year
there
an
18-year-old
boy,
he
conducts
himself
in
such
a
way
and
has
the
all
that
has
come
out
with
something
like
this
and
talking
this
very
school
administrators
whom
he
had
chosen
to
go
to
earn

education.
and
he
closed
it
then
with
this
article
and
counts
and
brought
and
bribed
heavy
counts.

for
as
long
as
the
puppet
administration
refuses
to
acknowledge
that
this
is
our

mr.
robert
h.
roberts
registration.
he
was
--
they
asked
them
not
to
come
in
and
register
for
classes
and
just
to
freeze
the
university
so
to
speak
and
to
bring
it
to
a
complete
start,
that
would
be
the
effect
of
it.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
this
happened
on
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
on
august
the
18
to
which
was
the
last
day
of
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
--
summer
term,
yes
sir,
the
--
they
have
two
terms
during
the
summer
there
and
operate
on
the
quarter
hour
basis.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
that
it
was
to
be
serious
enough
about
urging
the
boycott,
but
you
can't
separate
it.
it
was
all
one
article.
he
did
all
of
it
for
design
for
one
purpose
that
the
administrators
found
that
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
disrupting
the
school,
and
that
didn't
entitle
him
to
remain
on
the
campus
any
longer
as
a
result
of
it.
now,
if
the
judicial
branch
is
going
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
people
of
a
character
that
i
have
described
of
this
faculty
advisory
committee,
on
this
question
of
fact
and
really
it
is
a
question
of
fact
of
whether
or
not
these
things,
these
acts
committed
were
tapped
that
would
be
disruptive
on
the
school
campus
or
were
just
playing
free
expression
or
not,
and
they
found
otherwise.
now
if
we're
going
to
get
into
this
field,
where
are
we
going
to
stop?
wouldn't
the
next
logical
place
be
to
examine
the
examination
papers
given
to
a
student
and
the
time
of
whether
the
professor
you've
given
him
a
passing
mark
or
not?
after
all,
you
can
effectively
expel
in
that
way.
if
he
doesn't,
then
any
practical
any
university
in
the
country
if
he
doesn't
make
his
grades,
he's
not
entitled
to
enroll
the
next
quarter.
you
could
eliminate
him
in
that
manner.
i
just
respectfully
urge
the
court
to
give
some
support
and
some
credit
to
these
men
of
outstanding
ability
and
making
the
determination
that
it
involves
a
factual
matter
and
if
you
do
so,
i
feel
that
the
court
will
affirm
the
action
in
it
and
i
thank
you
for
your
kind
attention.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
--
associate
justices.
i
want
to
first
take
care
a
little
matter
of
the
reply
brief.
it
was
made
in
my
brief
in
which
it
alleged
that
i
had
made
some
erroneous
statements.
only
two
points
that
i
want
to
raise
in
connection
to
that.
one
is
to
the
effect
that
i
have
left
the
impression
at
least
that
the
leafleting
activity
that
this
petitioner
has
been
charged
with
and
found
guilty
of
was
connected
in
some
way
with
the
arrival
on
the
campus,
mr.
carmichael
when
ensuing
riot
that
occurred.
i
am
wrong
about
that
and
i
apologize
to
the
court
and
to
opposing
counsel.
there
had
been
a
number
of
leaflets
passed
out
at
about
this
time
and
some
of
them
before
and
that
some
after
the
riot
occurred
down
the
campus
in
the
summer
of
1967.
there
was
one
of
them
for
instance
that
demanded
that
the
administration
invite
mr.
carmichael
there.
they
later
did
and
the
riot
did
result.
however,
this
particular
leaflet
which
advocated
and
urged
the
student
body
to
boycott
registration
at
the
school
was
passed
out
after
the
riot
had
occurred.
now,
the
second
point
that
i
would
make
in
the
reply
brief
is
in
regard
to
the
charge
against
this
petitioner
of
being
in
violation
of
city
county
or
state
laws.
it
is
urged
here
that
by
the
words
of
dr.
payne
who
was
the
dean
of
students
and
who
presided
over
these
hearings
that
he
agreed
that
this
was
not
used
against
the
student
and
the
hearings,.
the
record
will
not
bear
mr.
boult
out
on
that.
i
think
he
has
failed
to
read
the
entire
record
in
regard
to
it.
what
actually
took
place,
mr.
hedgepeth
on
page
12
of
the
transcript
of
the
proceedings
of
the
fac
hearing
made
it
clear
that
we
were,
or
the
school
was
relying
upon
any
disorderly
conduct
or
conduct
unfitting
a
student
or
any
that
violated
the
rule
of
the
handbook
there
at
the
institution.
further
on
and
about
70
to
78,
there
were
about
eight-full
pages
where
it
was
developed
as
to
just
what
mr.
jones
had
been
convicted
of
and
paid
the
fine
in
the
metropolitan
court
iv.
so,
those
are
the
two
points
i
want
to
raise
on
that.
the
--
we
have
made
two
issues
out
of
the
four
that
the
petitioner
had.
we
feel
that
there
only
two
things
involved,
one
is
the
entire
matter
of
the
procedure
including
the
due
process
rights
of
these
petitioners.
as
stated
earlier,
there
were
five
original
petitioners,
two
of
them
were
dismissed
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
i
mean
charges
against
them
were
dismissed.
the
other
three
were
found
guilty
of
acts
that
warranted
their
suspension.
now,
that's
another
thing
that
i
want
to
make
clear
to
the
court
and
that
is
the
fact
that
these
students
were
not
expelled,
they
were
suspended.
they
have
not
--
this
petitioner
has
not
gone
back
to
school
and
sought
readmission
since
the
suspension.
i
don't
know
whether
the
school
would
allow
him
readmittance
or
not.
his
was
an
out
of
state
student
and
he
came
down
there
and
he
did
things
that
they
felt
to
be
and
found
to
be
disruptive.
this
one
piece
of
literature
tried
to
impress
his
will
upon
the
other
students,
for
example
and
calls
them
not
to
register
for
school
and
thereby
disrupt
the
entire
procedure.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
one
thing
else
that
he
did
there
in
connection
with
the
leaflet,
he
lied
about
it.
he
said
that
he
did
not
do
it
despite
of
the
fact
that
the
president
of
the
university
says
he
handed
it
me
one
himself
right
in
front
of
the
administration
building
and
he
had
about
50
of
them
in
his
hands
when
he
did
it.
later
down
in
the
cafeteria
testified
that
if
there
was
some
discrepancy
about
the
date
that
she
claimed
that
it
was
passed
out,
but
she
said
there
wasn't
any
question
in
her
mind
but
that
was
the
piece
of
literature
was.
she
went
over
and
picked
it
up
and
read
it.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
no
sir,
then
the
third
thing
is
that
he
violated
the
rules
of
the
student
handbook
and
that
he
was
convicted
and
fined
in
metropolitan
court
for
two
charges
of
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
sir,
no
sir
and
this
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
no
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir,
they
found
that
he
was
guilty
of
conviction
or
the
committee
found
that
mr.
jones
has
seized
upon
opportunity
on
different
occasions
to
promote
unrest
on
the
campus
with
such
actions
as
distributing
literature
designed
for
the
purpose
--
and
then
at
the
hearing,
he
demonstrate
his
matter
--
over
the
truth
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
considering
all
that
matters
before
this
committee,
we
feel
that
mr.
kenneth
jones
has
violated
the
rules
of
conduct,
governing
students
at
this
end
and
in
the
university
such
an
extent
that
he
should
be
suspended.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
no
sir,
no
more
than
one
of
the
things,
specifically
in
there
and
was
that
if
he
was
found
to
be
in
violation
of
any
state,
county
or
city
or
federal
law
that
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
has
listed
as
being
requiring
sever
discipline.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
no
sir,
he
hadn't
been
charged
with
that
of
course
we
insist
that
he
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir
we
do.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
for
this
reason,
he
--
of
course,
we
think
that
the
notice
required
for
most
things
wouldn't
apply
to
personal
conduct
of
that
kind
which
he
did
knowingly.
he
had
the
first
notice
of
anybody
that
he
was
going
to
be
made
the
resolve
within
himself
to
tell
lie
in
that
committee.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
if
the
court
please,
i
think
it
would
be
somewhat
comparable
to
this.
this
morning,
you
graciously
permitted
me
to
practice
for
this
court.
part
of
what
you
based
that
on
was
on
the
application
that
i
filed.
suppose
that
i
lied
in
that
application
and
you
brought
me
in
here
for
a
hearing
and
to
determine
whether
i
should
have
that
privilege
you
gave
me
revoked
and
while
in
here,
i
openly
and
blatantly
lied
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
well
of
course
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
well
of
course,
i
think
that
it
really
becomes
moot
anyway
if
you'll
recall
that
after
this
hearing
and
he
certainly
had
notice
at
that
time
about
it
and
was
accused
of
lying
to
them,
we
had
a
full
rest
court
hearing
in
the
us
district
court
in
middle
tennessee
and
imagine
and
judge
miller
agreed
of
course
with
the
university
officials
in
connection
with
all
of
these
things
that
they
found
against
him.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir,
i
certainly
do.
now,
mr.
jones
claimed
that
he
only
passed
up
some
other
leaflets,
one
of
them
i
think
was
called
the
black
thesis
which
was
more
or
less
philosophical
piece
of
writing.
now,
that
wasn't
so
far
as
i
can
see
anything
in
there
that
would
have
been
disruptive.
but
suppose
had
been
able
to
persuade
even
a
substantial
number
of
these
students
to
refuse
to
register
when
the
term
started,
certainly
that
would
disrupt
the
school
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
it
was
approximately
a
month-and-a-half.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
no.
but
they
stopped
in
course.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
--
they
didn't
permit
him
to
go
that
summer.
this
happened
during
the
summer
and
they'd
already
sent
him
notice
that
he
had
not
been
cleared
for
attendance
here
on
the
summer
term
of
school.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
those
were
it
didn't
turn
out
that
way,
but
i
don't
think
that
you
have
to
wait
till
the
horse
is
out
of
the
barn
before
you
are
allowed
to
close
the
door.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
the
charge
itself
charged
in
with
him
and
they
readily
admitted
it
and
they
are
on
page
70
to
78.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
well,
it's
in
my
brief
on
page
5,
but
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
and
the
entire
discussion
about
the
criminal
activity
that
he
was
charged
with
takes
place
on
between
pages
and
70
and
78
of
the
transcript
of
the
fac
here
as
also
of
course
in
the
transcript
of
the
court
hearing
before
the
judge
miller.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
no
sir.
we
had
the
part
of
the
record,
though
here
is
the
fac
transcript
of
the
hearing.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
--
no
sir
ti
should
be,
it's
on
page
48
of
here.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
of
course
we
feel
that
the
most
serious
thing
that
took
place
was
the
matter
of
this
leaflet
which
he
attempted
to
disrupt
orderly
activities
of
the
school
and
even
in
tinker
it
was
stated
clear
that
the
orderly
activities
of
the
school
is
not
subject
to
first
amendment
rights.
we
think
that
registration
certainly
is
an
orderly
and
part
of
the
record
functions
on
school.
my
time
is
expired.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
conclude
argument
for
the
respondents
in
this
manner.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
an
article
written
by
professor
charles
allen
wright
in
connection
with
speech
to
be
delivered
on
vanderbilt
university
campus
on
october
1969
entitled
“the
constitution
on
the
campus.”
this
is
one
of
the
oliver
womble
holm
series
and
i
think
that
it
is
one
of
the
best
written
articles
i
have
ever
read
and
i
recommend
it
to
the
court
if
they
haven't
already
seen
it.
in
it
though,
professor
wright
basically
wound
up
by
saying
that
expression
can
be
restrictive,
if
at
any
time,
if
material
substantially
interferes
with
a
normal
procedures
of
the
university
or
with
the
wraps
of
other.
now,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
basic
issue
involved
here
is
just
the
action
that
this
student
has
been
accused
and
found
guilty
of
committing
based
primarily
under
his
first
amendment
rights.
yesterday
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes,
your
honor.
there
was
a
finding
that
he
had
committed
a
misdemeanor
and
found
guilty
in
court
in
violation
of
the
student
handbook
which
had
been
a
specific
charge
against
him
in
addition.
they
also
found
that
he
lied
to
the
committee
while
before
ti
and
openly
before
it
and
i
might
say
this,
it
is
not
only
just,
he
just
told
the
president
of
the
effect
that
he
was
lying
in
front
of
this
outstanding
faculty
group
and
other
students
and
even
the
press
was
present
when
this
happened
which
compounded
the
disrespect
that
he
showed
to
president
on
this
occasion.
yesterday,
i
had
the
feeling
that
there
was
some
question
in
the
mind
of
perhaps
associate
justice
marshall
in
regard
to
why
this
action
on
the
leafleting
or
the
boycott
literature
didn't
result
in
any
kind
of
a
serious
incident.
i
didn't
called
the
court's
attention
to
this
but
i
would
like
to
do
it
this
time.
mr.
jones
at
the
time
that
he
passed
out
this
leaflet
had
already
been
temporarily
suspended
from
school.
he
was
not
on
the
campus
at
that
time
as
a
student.
when
he
passed
out
this
literature
he
was
awaiting
his
hearing
to
see
whether
or
not
he
would
be
admitted
in
the
full
term
or
not.
this
literature
was
passed
out
on
august
18,
1967
which
according
to
the
calendar
which
you
have
in
the
appendix
in
the
student
handbook
part
of
it
which
begins
on
page
175
of
the
joint
appendix,
a
calendar
of
the
school.
here,
you'll
find
that
this
was
the
last
day
of
final
examinations
for
the
last
term
of
the
summer
quarter.
when
he
did
this,
the
baccalaureate
services
follow
that
by
two
days
and
school
was
out
then
until
the
following
term
started.
that
is
the
reason
there
was
no
more
commotion
following
it.
however,
i
direct
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
was
followed
--
itself
following
by
just
a
couple
of
weeks
or
so,
arrived
on
the
campus
and
tensions
were
high.
now
admittedly,
the
faculty
hasn't
in
it's
findings
written
out
that
as
a
result
of
this
literature
been
passed
out
on
the
final
examination
day
that
john
smith
came
to
him
and
said,
“well,
that
bothers
me
and
i
couldn't
correctly
answer
one
of
the
questions
on
the
examination”
or
anything
like
that,
but
they
found
it
as
a
matter
of
their
interpretation.
they
were
there
on
the
campus.
we're
not
talking
about
some
rural
constable
or
something
like
that
that
might
be
found
in
my
home
county
of
pickett.
we're
talking
about
nine
of
the
outstanding
members
of
the
faculty
on
tennessee
state
university's
campus.
we're
talking
about
the
vice
president
maritus
(ph),
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
faculty
advisory
committee
with
30
some
years
of
experience
there
as
a
school
administrator.
we
are
talking
about
dr.
j.a.
payne
who
acted
because
of
dr.
boswell's
poor
health
as
the
presiding
officer
over
this
faculty
advisory
meeting
with
the
great
many
years
of
experience
on
the
campus
and
as
being
the
students.
we're
talking
about
the
dean
of
women
and
the
dean
of
men.
school
administrators,
practically
all
if
not
all
of
them
hold
doctorate
degrees
and
had
the
combined
experience
of
well
and
in
excess
of
100
years
there
on
the
campus,
that's
who
we're
talking
about,
substituting
the
judgment
on
as
to
what
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
i
should
call
the
events
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir
and
i
think
it
would
be
all
together
a
different
situation.
i
think
you
could
perhaps
of
even
gone
across
the
street
a
little
ways
to
centennial
park
and
got
up
on
a
bench
and
maybe
made
a
speech
on
it
and
it
would
have
been
somewhat
different.
here,
it
is
calculated
to
do
one
thing,
calls
unrest
and
tried
to
prevail
his
ideas
and
his
desires
on
to
the
student
body
there.
he
had
already
been
suspended.
he
--
it
wasn't
a
matter
for
him
not
to
register.
he
was
trying
to
ask
everybody
else
to
join
with
him
because
his
conduct
had
caused
him
to
be
suspended
where
he
wasn't
permitted
to
continue
during
the
summer
quarter
and
was
called
on
them
to
do
so.
now
as
to
the
type
of
thing
that
was
in
this
makes
very
important.
there
was
really
more
to
it
than
just
boycott.
so
far
as
it
being
designed
to
create
unrest
and
we
got
to
keep
in
mind
now
that
this
was
fall
on
a
period
of
great
deal
of
disturbance
on
the
campus
where
property
was
destroyed
and
people
were
injured.
some
of
the
things
that
he
says
for
example
anything
that
give
the
puppets,
i'm
talking
about
school
administrators
now.
that's
a
reference
that
he
makes
to
them.
he
calls
them
puppets
throughout
this.
i
want
to
adapt
civilized
tactics
used
by
the
man
and
that
sort
of
thing.
then
he
goes
on
with
words
like
“does
the
campus
will
become
a
concentration
camp
controlled
and
contained
by
the
legislation
of
the
raciest
dogs'
downtown.”
the
acts
of
the
puppet
administrators
here
at
the
end
referring
to
these
people
for
whom
he
had
already
been
advised
that
he
was
going
and
have
to
come
and
clearance
have
with
before
he
could
be
re-enrolled.
the
billy
clubs
and
guns
of
nashville's
raciest
cops
and
ultimately
the
gestapo
tactics
of
the
honorable
national
guard
whose
pale
faces
have
already
been
seen
in
memphis,
nashville.
we
as
intelligent
black
students
will
not
be
guarded
by
trampling
parialist
idiots
who
call
themselves
administrators.
now
that's
what
he's
saying
about
the
school
administrators.
he
said
earlier
that
he
came
down
to
tennessee
to
go
to
school
because
he
investigate
and
found
that
it
was
a
great
school
and
he
wanted
to
go
down
there.
yet
in
his
first
year
there
an
18-year-old
boy,
he
conducts
himself
in
such
a
way
and
has
the
all
that
has
come
out
with
something
like
this
and
talking
this
very
school
administrators
whom
he
had
chosen
to
go
to
earn
an
education.
and
he
closed
it
then
with
this
article
and
counts
and
brought
and
bribed
heavy
counts.
cast
your
vote
for
student
power.
boycott
registration,
september
23
and
for
as
long
as
the
puppet
administration
refuses
to
acknowledge
that
this
is
our
university.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
registration.
he
was
--
they
asked
them
not
to
come
in
and
register
for
classes
and
just
to
freeze
the
university
so
to
speak
and
to
bring
it
to
a
complete
start,
that
would
be
the
effect
of
it.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
this
happened
on
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
on
august
the
18
to
which
was
the
last
day
of
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
--
summer
term,
yes
sir,
the
--
they
have
two
terms
during
the
summer
there
and
operate
on
the
quarter
hour
basis.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
that
it
was
to
be
serious
enough
about
urging
the
boycott,
but
you
can't
separate
it.
it
was
all
one
article.
he
did
all
of
it
for
design
for
one
purpose
that
the
administrators
found
that
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
disrupting
the
school,
and
that
didn't
entitle
him
to
remain
on
the
campus
any
longer
as
a
result
of
it.
now,
if
the
judicial
branch
is
going
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
people
of
a
character
that
i
have
described
of
this
faculty
advisory
committee,
on
this
question
of
fact
and
really
it
is
a
question
of
fact
of
whether
or
not
these
things,
these
acts
committed
were
tapped
that
would
be
disruptive
on
the
school
campus
or
were
just
playing
free
expression
or
not,
and
they
found
otherwise.
now
if
we're
going
to
get
into
this
field,
where
are
we
going
to
stop?
wouldn't
the
next
logical
place
be
to
examine
the
examination
papers
given
to
a
student
and
the
time
of
whether
the
professor
you've
given
him
a
passing
mark
or
not?
after
all,
you
can
effectively
expel
in
that
way.
if
he
doesn't,
then
any
practical
any
university
in
the
country
if
he
doesn't
make
his
grades,
he's
not
entitled
to
enroll
the
next
quarter.
you
could
eliminate
him
in
that
manner.
i
just
respectfully
urge
the
court
to
give
some
support
and
some
credit
to
these
men
of
outstanding
ability
and
making
the
determination
that
it
involves
a
factual
matter
and
if
you
do
so,
i
feel
that
the
court
will
affirm
the
action
in
it
and
i
thank
you
for
your
kind
attention.
