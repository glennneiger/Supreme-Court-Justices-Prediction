mr.
gene
e.
voigts
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
while
we
agree
with
the
facts
as
have
been
related
by
mr.
clifford
in
detail,
the
sequence
of
events
that
transpired
in
the
circuit
court
of
jackson
county
back
in
1960
and
the
facts
that
were
introduced
adduced
in
evidence
at
the
time
of
the
two
trials,
we
of
course,
disagree
with
the
conclusion
that
he
withdraw
from
those
facts.
we
believe,
of
course,
that
the
general
issue
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
state
may
try
a
defendant
for
a
charge
of
robbery,
if
the
defendant
has
previously
been
acquitted
on
a
charge
of
robbery
involving
a
different
victim
and
different
property
even
though
the
two
charges
of
robbery
arose
out
of
essentially
the
same
transaction
and
the
same
point
in
time.
it
is
our
belief
and
our
contention
that
the
state
may
do
so
and
we
suggest
that
the
state
may
do
so,
first
because
the
second
trial
based
upon
a
second
separate
and
distinct
offense
did
not
amount
to
fundamental
unfairness.
secondly,
we
suggest
that
the
constitutional
prohibition
against
placing
a
person
twice
in
jeopardy
for
the
same
offense
is
precisely
that,
that
the
test
is
the
identity
of
the
offense
rather
than
the
test
being
the
same
transaction.
third,
we
suggest
that
the
principle
of
collateral
estoppel
is
not
applicable
upon
the
facts
presented
in
this
case
and
finally,
that
even
if
this
court
should
conclude
that
the
principle
of
collateral
estoppel
applies
to
the
fact
of
this
case,
that
it
is
not
required
by
the
constitution
either
under
the
double
jeopardy
provision
or
as
a
part
of
the
due
process
clause.
we
believe
that
these
issues
based
upon
the
questions
presented
in
this
case
must
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
state.
if
i
may
then,
i
would
like
to
direct
my
attention
first
to
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
constitutional
prohibition
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
your
honor,
i
think
as
mr.
clifford
previously
indicated,
at
both
of
the
trials,
it
was
not
clear
and
there
was
not
any
clear
cut
identification
as
to
which
one
of
the
four
robbers
took
the
money
out
of,
shall
we
say
mr.
knight's
pocket,
who
was
the
robbery
victim
in
the
first
trial
or
mr.
roberts'
pocket
in
the
second
trial.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
he
was
in
fact
charged
with
robbing
all
six
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
that
is
right,
your
honor.
the
instruct
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
he
was
so
charged
and
the
instructions
to
the
jury
--
instructed
the
jury
to
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
if
they
found
that
he
did
these
certain
specified
elements
either
acting
alone
or
knowingly
acting
in
concert
with
the
others.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
it
is
possible.
i
do
not
believe
that
to
sustain
the
state's
position
in
this
case
your
honor
that
i
need
to
necessarily
go
to
that
extension.
i
think
that
my
position
has
to
simply
be
that
by
virtue
of
his
acquittal
on
the
first
trial,
in
fact
did
not
constitutionally
preclude
the
state
from
trying
him
the
second
time.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
of
course,
obviously,
i
believe
that
there's
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
your
honor,
i
do
not
know.
it
does
indicate
in
the
record
that
there
were
six
informations
filed,
that
he
was
tried
in
may
of
1960
on
the
first
information,
acquitted.
he
was
tried
on
the
second
information
in
june
and
was
convicted.
there
is
no
indication
as
to
what
has
happened
as
to
the
status
of
the
four
remaining
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
yes,
of
course.
i
am
sure
that
there
are
problems,
should
there
ever
be
any
attempt
by
the
state
to
prosecute
on
those
because
of
the
lapse
of
time
that
has
been
involved.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
i
should
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
no,
your
honor.
there
was
no
evidence
introduced
by
the
defendant
whatsoever
in
either
the
first
trial
or
the
second
trial.
interestingly
enough
and
purely
as
in
the
side,
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
at
the
first
trial
even
waived
to
closing
argument
to
the
jury.
it
was
simply
the
state's
evidence,
the
first
part
of
the
state's
final
argument,
the
jury
retired
to
deliberate
and
it
then
of
course
returned
a
verdict
of
not
guilty.
it
if
--
mr.
clifford
has
indicated,
had
written
on
it
due
to
insufficient
evidence,
we
submit
this
as
really
not
relevant
or
important.
we
believe
that
would
have
been
applied
in
the
verdict
in
any
event.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
i
think
so
to
the
extent
your
honor
that
we
suggest
that
the
principle
of
collateral
estoppel
would
not
be
constitutionally
required
to
be
applied
by
the
state
in
this
situation.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
no,
your
honor,
it's
a
general
verdict.
they
returned
a
finding
of
either
guilty
or
not
guilty
and
of
course,
in
this
situation
he
was
charged
under
the
--
our
habitual
criminal
act
and
so
the
jury
did
not
have
the
added
function
of
assessing
the
sentence.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
that
may
be,
your
honor,
but
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
you
do
not
go
beyond
those
issues
which
necessarily
had
to
be
found.
and
we're
suggesting
that
the
ultimate
issue
involved
in
this
case
in
the
first
trial
was
whether
or
not
ashe
either
acting
alone
or
knowingly
in
concert
with
another
robbed
don
knight
and
whether
or
not
the
jury
in
that
case
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
all
of
the
necessary
elements
which
they
would
have
to
find
on
a
charge
of
robbery
in
the
first
degree.
now,
of
course,
i
will
concede
and
agree
with
mr.
clifford
that
if
you
examine
the
record,
this
was
perhaps
the
really
only
contested
issue
but
i
think
if
you
will
examine
the
record
of
the
first
trial,
one
must
conclude
that
there
was
hardly
any
issue
contested
at
all
if
you
are
talking
about
contesting
an
issue
from
the
standpoint
of
serious
and
extensive
cross-examination
by
the
defense
counsel.
the
state's
evidence
came
in
relatively
free
from
any
objection,
relatively
free
from
any
extensive
cross
examination
whatsoever.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
acquittal
and
we
suggest
that
when
they
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
no.
this
was
a
separate
trial,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
just
mr.
ashe
was
involved
in
this
particular
trial.
prior
to
this,
he
had
move
for
a
severance
of
his
trial.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
your
honor
i
cannot
explain
the
jury
verdict
and
i
do
not
frankly
believe
that
it
is
necessary
that
i
do
explain
the
jury
verdict.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
i
think
it's
very
possible
that
the
jury
found
that
there
was
a
lack
of
sufficient
identification
of
mr.
ashe
as
one
of
the
participants
in
this.
i
think
it
was
equally
suggested
by
the
missouri
supreme
court
and
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
that
even
though
there
had
been
other
evidence
that
was
un-contradicted
as
to
the
taking
of
property
or
as
to
a
number
of
other
elements
that
they
might
have
found
on
those.
and
i
think
too,
it
was
interesting
that
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
observed
that
perhaps
the
jury
finding
these
six
gentlemen
playing
poker
until
i
believe
about
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
for
--
as
mr.
clifford
has
indicated
quite
sizable
stakes,
the
jury
may
have
simply
decided
that
they
were
not
going
to
extend
any
protection
of
the
law
to
the
people
that
were
engaging
in
this
type
of
activity.
now,
i
cannot
really
stand
here
and
argue
to
the
court
that
they
found
on
anyone
of
these
items
any
more
logically
or
reasonably
than
another,
but
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
state's
position
in
this
case
to
go
beyond
that
verdict
and
to
try
to
make
a
determination
or
to
speculate
as
to
what
facts
might
have
been
considered
by
the
jury
or
as
to
what
facts
the
jury
might
necessarily
have
based
their
verdict
on.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
it
might
well
have
done
so
i
must
say
in
all
candid
though
that
i
don't
think
that
the
record
necessarily
clearly
indicates
that
this
was
an
element.
but
this
is
in
part
why
i
am
suggesting
that
one
need
not
go
that
additional
step
to
examine
the
record
in
its
entirety
to
attempt
to
pinpoint
and
determine
what
specific
element
the
jury
found
like
in
--
at
the
first
trial.
as
indicated
by
mr.
clifford,
of
course,
at
the
time
that
this
case
originally
came
to
this
court
and
at
the
time
that
the
briefs
were
in
the
process
of
being
prepared
and
submitted,
palko
versus
connecticut
was
of
course
still
essentially
the
law
insofar
as
the
application
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
state
action.
since
that
time
of
course
we
have
had
benton
versus
marilyn
and
justice
marshall
speaking
for
the
court
of
observed
there
that
the
double
jeopardy
prohibition
of
the
fifth
amendment
represents
a
fundamental
ideal
in
our
constitutional
heritages
and
that
it
should
apply
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
its
--
while
that
case
did
not
deal
specifically
with
the
question
as
to
whether
this
applicable
to
the
same
offense
or
what
type
of
test
you
would
apply
in
determining
whether
a
person
has
been
placed
twice
in
jeopardy,
i
think
its
significant
that
there
was
quotation
in
that
opinion
from
blackstone
and
significant
that
the
quotation
was
at
the
plea
of
former
acquittal
as
grounded
on
the
universal
maxim
of
law
of
england,
that
no
man
is
to
be
brought
into
jeopardy
of
his
life
more
than
once
for
the
same
offense.
and
i
submit
that
it
is
interesting
that
the
constitutional
language,
the
language
that
is
used
by
blackstone
is
the
same
offense
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
the
common
law
cases
of
england
that
the
emphasis
was
placed
upon
the
identity
of
the
offense
from
the
standpoint
of
the
same
evidence
test
perhaps.
and
i
submit
that
when
you
apply
that
same
evidence
test
and
that
is
namely
whether
or
not
in
the
second
trial,
the
identical
evidence
which
was
produced
at
the
first
trial
was
necessary
to
support
the
indictment
that
we
must
conclude
that
there
is
not
that
identity
of
offenses.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
the
difference
as
was
indicated
by
mr.
justice
white
from
one
thing.
in
missouri
the
thrust
of
the
charge
of
robbery
is
the
taking
of
property
either
from
the
ownership
or
the
possession
of
a
person
by
threat
or
fear
of
violence
to
their
person
and
obviously,
this
involved
a
different
issue
than
would
have
necessarily
had
to
be
litigated
at
the
first
trial.
the
evidence
which
would
necessarily
support
a
conviction
on
the
charge
of
robbing
knight
was
not
that
same
evidence
which
was
necessary
to
support
the
charge
as
to
whether
or
not
he
robbed
roy
roberts.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
missouri
supreme
court
has
so
indicated
that
that
is
the
law
as
it
exists
in
the
state
of
missouri
and
as
i
understand
this
court's
prior
ruling
in
the
hoag
versus
new
jersey,
of
course,
that
is
a
determination
to
be
made
by
that
court
as
to
whether
or
not
at
the
same
time
you
rob
two
people
whether
or
not
that
constitutes
one
offense
or
whether
or
not
it
constitutes
separate
and
independent
offenses
as
against
each
of
those
two
people.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
no,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
yes,
your
honor,
if
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
no.
once
again,
mr.
justice,
at
the
time
of
both
trials
there
is
this
problem
of
identity
of
robbers,
number
one,
two,
three
and
four.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
though
that
as
they
came
down
into
that
basement
that
one
of
the
robbers
had
i
believe
a
sawed-off
shotgun
which
was
described
as
perhaps
a
410.
the
other
two
had
pistols
of
a
smaller
caliber.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
the
evidence
is
essentially
that
at
the
second
trial
and
i
believe
at
the
first
trial
that
once
again
that
the
people
who
came
down
into
the
basement,
your
honor,
with
the
guns
forced
these
six
participants
in
the
card
games
to
go
over
against
the
wall
at
one
point.
they
then
forced
them
back
into
the
center
of
the
room,
had
all,
but
one
of
them
i
believe
removed
their
trousers
and
they
were
tied
together
at
that
point.
and
there
was
testimony
of
course
by
each
one
of
the
witnesses
as
to
the
various
people
who
came
around
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
yes.
except
for
the
modifications
that
were
indicated
by
mr.
clifford
in
his
statement
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
yes
sir.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
with
the
exception
your
honor
that
the
question
of
identification
was
developed
much
more
extensively
at
the
second
trial.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
and
in
addition
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
i
don't
know
but
i
think
it's
quite
obvious,
your
honor,
that
this
is
one
of
the
problems
apparently
that
it
concerned
the
prosecutor
at
the
first
trial.
it
was
the
same
prosecutor
at
the
two
trials.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
but
under
the
test
of
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
i'm
suggesting
that
there
is
protection
to
this
man
though
your
honor,
by
virtue
of
a
--
if
you
will,
a
fundamental
unfairness
type
test.
and
i
cannot
tell
this
court
whether
it
arises
upon
the
second
trial
or
the
third
trial
or
the
fourth
trial.
i
submit
that
depends
upon
the
facts
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
i
would
suggest
that
that's
not
necessarily
a
conclusion
that
must
follow
from
benton.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
yes
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
once
again,
your
honor,
i've
suggested
that
i
do
not
feel
that
i
can
indicate
a
mathematical
number
to
this
court.
but
i
think
that
the
protection
which
does
extend
to
this
defendant
would
be
a
protection
under
a
fundamental
unfairness
and
perhaps
this
court
may
well
conclude
on
the
facts
of
this
case
that
that
arose
at
the
conclusion
of
the
first
trial
or
it
may
conclude
that
the
--
after
the
second
trial
it
arose.
but
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
there
was
not
any
substantial
delay
between
the
first
trial
and
the
second
trial
as
was
present
in
the
case
of
hoag,
there
was
almost
two
years
elapsed
between
the
first
trial
and
the
second
trial
in
that
situation.
i
am
further
suggesting
that
there
was
no
showing
or
indication
in
the
record
that
by
virtue
of
the
delay
or
the
second
trial
that
the
defendant
lost
any
witnesses
or
had
any
difficulty
procuring
any
evidence
which
might
have
been
available
to
him
otherwise.
and
these
are
some
of
the
factors
which
i
submit,
mr.
justice,
would
we
considered
in
that
total
question
of
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
a
fundamental
unfairness
and
we
submit
under
that
facts
here
involved
that
there
was
not.
the
record
indicates
clearly
that
defense
counsel
had
the
benefit
of
the
transcript,
of
the
testimony
of
witnesses
at
the
preliminary
hearing
that
he
was
able
to
use
in
cross-examination.
he
apparently
had
the
benefit
of
their
testimony
at
the
first
trial
that
he
was
able
to
use
in
cross-examination
for
purposes
of
impeachment.
and
so,
under
those
circumstances,
where
you
do
have
two
separate
and
distinct
crimes,
i
submit
that
the
second
trial
presented
on
the
facts
of
this
case
did
not
rise
to
the
level
of
fundamental
unfairness.
we
further
submit
that
it
does
not
constitute
double
jeopardy
under
the
test
that
had
traditionally
been
used
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
that
identity
of
offense
that
results
in
a
person
being
placed
twice
in
jeopardy.
finally,
i
suppose
we
come
to
the
issue
then
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
collateral
estoppel
that
is
applicable
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
we
suggest
very
simply
first
of
all
that
there
has
not
a
collateral
estoppel
because
the
ultimate
fact
that
was
determined
at
the
first
trial
was
whether
or
not
ashe
robbed
knight.
we
submit
that
there
was
not
any
determination
of
merely
evidentiary
facts
or
merely
evidentiary
matters
and
that
since
that
ultimate
fact
is
not
therefore
conclusive
on
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
he
robbed
roberts
on
the
separate,
second
separate
and
distinct
offense
that
collateral
estoppel
is
not
applicable
upon
the
facts
of
the
case,
but
perhaps
more
importantly,
we
suggest
that
collateral
estoppel
need
not
be
applied
by
this
court
simply
because
as
indicated
in
this
court's
decision
in
hoag
versus
new
jersey
there
was
a
reluctance
to
declare
the
principle
of
collateral
estoppel
as
a
constitutional
principle
that
was
applicable
to
the
state
action
and
we
submit
that
the
same
reasoning
which
was
applied
by
the
court
at
that
time
should
once
again
be
applied
by
the
court
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
well
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
if
on
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
your
honor,
i
must
frankly
say,
i
do
not
think
that
that
question
has
been
adjudicated
by
the
courts
of
missouri
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
i
frankly,
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
yes,
sir
and
i
would
suggest
that
under
those
circumstances
if
there
were
express
findings
of
fact
that
the
principle
of
collateral
estoppel
would
be
applicable
without
getting
into
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
principle
of
collateral
estoppel
rises
to
the
level
of
being
constitutional
applicable.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
as
i
understand
it
your
honor
it
has
been
applied
(voice
overlap)
situations.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
the
cases
which
i
have
examined
on
that
question,
your
honor,
deal
with
it
i
believe
as
a
principle
of
collateral
estoppel
without
elevating
it
necessarily
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
guarantee.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
obviously,
my
view
has
to
be
in
this
case,
your
honor,
that
collateral
estoppel
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
guarantee.
that
collateral
estoppel
may
well
be
applied
by
this
court
in
the
federal
court
cases
as
a
part
of
its
supervisory
power
but
that
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
that's
right,
your
honor
because
it
is
collateral
estoppel
i
would
submit
is
not
a
part
of
the
definition
of
double
jeopardy
as
would
be
applied
by
our
constitution.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
for
those
reasons
then,
we
would
submit
that
this
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit;
first,
on
the
basis
that
the
actions
here
brought
in
question
did
not
constitute
a
fundamental
unfairness
to
the
petitioner.
secondly,
that
although
the
fifth
amendment
prohibition
against
double
jeopardy
is
applicable
to
the
states
that
nonetheless
there
were
two
separate
and
distinct
offenses
involved
in
this
particular
case.
finally,
we
would
suggest
that
collateral
estoppel
is
not
applicable
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
and
even
if
this
court
should
so
find
that
it
is
not
constitutionally
required.
for
those
reasons
we
would
ask
affirmance
of
the
opinion
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
thank
you
mr.
justice.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
while
we
agree
with
the
facts
as
have
been
related
by
mr.
clifford
in
detail,
the
sequence
of
events
that
transpired
in
the
circuit
court
of
jackson
county
back
in
1960
and
the
facts
that
were
introduced
adduced
in
evidence
at
the
time
of
the
two
trials,
we
of
course,
disagree
with
the
conclusion
that
he
withdraw
from
those
facts.
we
believe,
of
course,
that
the
general
issue
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
state
may
try
a
defendant
for
a
charge
of
robbery,
if
the
defendant
has
previously
been
acquitted
on
a
charge
of
robbery
involving
a
different
victim
and
different
property
even
though
the
two
charges
of
robbery
arose
out
of
essentially
the
same
transaction
and
the
same
point
in
time.
it
is
our
belief
and
our
contention
that
the
state
may
do
so
and
we
suggest
that
the
state
may
do
so,
first
because
the
second
trial
based
upon
a
second
separate
and
distinct
offense
did
not
amount
to
fundamental
unfairness.
secondly,
we
suggest
that
the
constitutional
prohibition
against
placing
a
person
twice
in
jeopardy
for
the
same
offense
is
precisely
that,
that
the
test
is
the
identity
of
the
offense
rather
than
the
test
being
the
same
transaction.
third,
we
suggest
that
the
principle
of
collateral
estoppel
is
not
applicable
upon
the
facts
presented
in
this
case
and
finally,
that
even
if
this
court
should
conclude
that
the
principle
of
collateral
estoppel
applies
to
the
fact
of
this
case,
that
it
is
not
required
by
the
constitution
either
under
the
double
jeopardy
provision
or
as
a
part
of
the
due
process
clause.
we
believe
that
these
issues
based
upon
the
questions
presented
in
this
case
must
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
state.
if
i
may
then,
i
would
like
to
direct
my
attention
first
to
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
constitutional
prohibition
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
your
honor,
i
think
as
mr.
clifford
previously
indicated,
at
both
of
the
trials,
it
was
not
clear
and
there
was
not
any
clear
cut
identification
as
to
which
one
of
the
four
robbers
took
the
money
out
of,
shall
we
say
mr.
knight's
pocket,
who
was
the
robbery
victim
in
the
first
trial
or
mr.
roberts'
pocket
in
the
second
trial.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
he
was
in
fact
charged
with
robbing
all
six
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
that
is
right,
your
honor.
the
instruct
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
he
was
so
charged
and
the
instructions
to
the
jury
--
instructed
the
jury
to
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
if
they
found
that
he
did
these
certain
specified
elements
either
acting
alone
or
knowingly
acting
in
concert
with
the
others.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
it
is
possible.
i
do
not
believe
that
to
sustain
the
state's
position
in
this
case
your
honor
that
i
need
to
necessarily
go
to
that
extension.
i
think
that
my
position
has
to
simply
be
that
by
virtue
of
his
acquittal
on
the
first
trial,
in
fact
did
not
constitutionally
preclude
the
state
from
trying
him
the
second
time.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
of
course,
obviously,
i
believe
that
there's
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
your
honor,
i
do
not
know.
it
does
indicate
in
the
record
that
there
were
six
informations
filed,
that
he
was
tried
in
may
of
1960
on
the
first
information,
acquitted.
he
was
tried
on
the
second
information
in
june
and
was
convicted.
there
is
no
indication
as
to
what
has
happened
as
to
the
status
of
the
four
remaining
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
yes,
of
course.
i
am
sure
that
there
are
problems,
should
there
ever
be
any
attempt
by
the
state
to
prosecute
on
those
because
of
the
lapse
of
time
that
has
been
involved.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
i
should
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
no,
your
honor.
there
was
no
evidence
introduced
by
the
defendant
whatsoever
in
either
the
first
trial
or
the
second
trial.
interestingly
enough
and
purely
as
in
the
side,
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
at
the
first
trial
even
waived
to
closing
argument
to
the
jury.
it
was
simply
the
state's
evidence,
the
first
part
of
the
state's
final
argument,
the
jury
retired
to
deliberate
and
it
then
of
course
returned
a
verdict
of
not
guilty.
it
if
--
mr.
clifford
has
indicated,
had
written
on
it
due
to
insufficient
evidence,
we
submit
this
as
really
not
relevant
or
important.
we
believe
that
would
have
been
applied
in
the
verdict
in
any
event.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
i
think
so
to
the
extent
your
honor
that
we
suggest
that
the
principle
of
collateral
estoppel
would
not
be
constitutionally
required
to
be
applied
by
the
state
in
this
situation.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
no,
your
honor,
it's
a
general
verdict.
they
returned
a
finding
of
either
guilty
or
not
guilty
and
of
course,
in
this
situation
he
was
charged
under
the
--
our
habitual
criminal
act
and
so
the
jury
did
not
have
the
added
function
of
assessing
the
sentence.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
that
may
be,
your
honor,
but
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
you
do
not
go
beyond
those
issues
which
necessarily
had
to
be
found.
and
we're
suggesting
that
the
ultimate
issue
involved
in
this
case
in
the
first
trial
was
whether
or
not
ashe
either
acting
alone
or
knowingly
in
concert
with
another
robbed
don
knight
and
whether
or
not
the
jury
in
that
case
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
all
of
the
necessary
elements
which
they
would
have
to
find
on
a
charge
of
robbery
in
the
first
degree.
now,
of
course,
i
will
concede
and
agree
with
mr.
clifford
that
if
you
examine
the
record,
this
was
perhaps
the
really
only
contested
issue
but
i
think
if
you
will
examine
the
record
of
the
first
trial,
one
must
conclude
that
there
was
hardly
any
issue
contested
at
all
if
you
are
talking
about
contesting
an
issue
from
the
standpoint
of
serious
and
extensive
cross-examination
by
the
defense
counsel.
the
state's
evidence
came
in
relatively
free
from
any
objection,
relatively
free
from
any
extensive
cross
examination
whatsoever.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
acquittal
and
we
suggest
that
when
they
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
no.
this
was
a
separate
trial,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
just
mr.
ashe
was
involved
in
this
particular
trial.
prior
to
this,
he
had
move
for
a
severance
of
his
trial.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
your
honor
i
cannot
explain
the
jury
verdict
and
i
do
not
frankly
believe
that
it
is
necessary
that
i
do
explain
the
jury
verdict.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
i
think
it's
very
possible
that
the
jury
found
that
there
was
a
lack
of
sufficient
identification
of
mr.
ashe
as
one
of
the
participants
in
this.
i
think
it
was
equally
suggested
by
the
missouri
supreme
court
and
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
that
even
though
there
had
been
other
evidence
that
was
un-contradicted
as
to
the
taking
of
property
or
as
to
a
number
of
other
elements
that
they
might
have
found
on
those.
and
i
think
too,
it
was
interesting
that
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
observed
that
perhaps
the
jury
finding
these
six
gentlemen
playing
poker
until
i
believe
about
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
for
--
as
mr.
clifford
has
indicated
quite
sizable
stakes,
the
jury
may
have
simply
decided
that
they
were
not
going
to
extend
any
protection
of
the
law
to
the
people
that
were
engaging
in
this
type
of
activity.
now,
i
cannot
really
stand
here
and
argue
to
the
court
that
they
found
on
anyone
of
these
items
any
more
logically
or
reasonably
than
another,
but
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
state's
position
in
this
case
to
go
beyond
that
verdict
and
to
try
to
make
a
determination
or
to
speculate
as
to
what
facts
might
have
been
considered
by
the
jury
or
as
to
what
facts
the
jury
might
necessarily
have
based
their
verdict
on.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
it
might
well
have
done
so
i
must
say
in
all
candid
though
that
i
don't
think
that
the
record
necessarily
clearly
indicates
that
this
was
an
element.
but
this
is
in
part
why
i
am
suggesting
that
one
need
not
go
that
additional
step
to
examine
the
record
in
its
entirety
to
attempt
to
pinpoint
and
determine
what
specific
element
the
jury
found
like
in
--
at
the
first
trial.
as
indicated
by
mr.
clifford,
of
course,
at
the
time
that
this
case
originally
came
to
this
court
and
at
the
time
that
the
briefs
were
in
the
process
of
being
prepared
and
submitted,
palko
versus
connecticut
was
of
course
still
essentially
the
law
insofar
as
the
application
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
state
action.
since
that
time
of
course
we
have
had
benton
versus
marilyn
and
justice
marshall
speaking
for
the
court
of
observed
there
that
the
double
jeopardy
prohibition
of
the
fifth
amendment
represents
a
fundamental
ideal
in
our
constitutional
heritages
and
that
it
should
apply
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
its
--
while
that
case
did
not
deal
specifically
with
the
question
as
to
whether
this
applicable
to
the
same
offense
or
what
type
of
test
you
would
apply
in
determining
whether
a
person
has
been
placed
twice
in
jeopardy,
i
think
its
significant
that
there
was
quotation
in
that
opinion
from
blackstone
and
significant
that
the
quotation
was
at
the
plea
of
former
acquittal
as
grounded
on
the
universal
maxim
of
law
of
england,
that
no
man
is
to
be
brought
into
jeopardy
of
his
life
more
than
once
for
the
same
offense.
and
i
submit
that
it
is
interesting
that
the
constitutional
language,
the
language
that
is
used
by
blackstone
is
the
same
offense
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
the
common
law
cases
of
england
that
the
emphasis
was
placed
upon
the
identity
of
the
offense
from
the
standpoint
of
the
same
evidence
test
perhaps.
and
i
submit
that
when
you
apply
that
same
evidence
test
and
that
is
namely
whether
or
not
in
the
second
trial,
the
identical
evidence
which
was
produced
at
the
first
trial
was
necessary
to
support
the
indictment
that
we
must
conclude
that
there
is
not
that
identity
of
offenses.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
the
difference
as
was
indicated
by
mr.
justice
white
from
one
thing.
in
missouri
the
thrust
of
the
charge
of
robbery
is
the
taking
of
property
either
from
the
ownership
or
the
possession
of
a
person
by
threat
or
fear
of
violence
to
their
person
and
obviously,
this
involved
a
different
issue
than
would
have
necessarily
had
to
be
litigated
at
the
first
trial.
the
evidence
which
would
necessarily
support
a
conviction
on
the
charge
of
robbing
knight
was
not
that
same
evidence
which
was
necessary
to
support
the
charge
as
to
whether
or
not
he
robbed
roy
roberts.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
missouri
supreme
court
has
so
indicated
that
that
is
the
law
as
it
exists
in
the
state
of
missouri
and
as
i
understand
this
court's
prior
ruling
in
the
hoag
versus
new
jersey,
of
course,
that
is
a
determination
to
be
made
by
that
court
as
to
whether
or
not
at
the
same
time
you
rob
two
people
whether
or
not
that
constitutes
one
offense
or
whether
or
not
it
constitutes
separate
and
independent
offenses
as
against
each
of
those
two
people.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
no,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
yes,
your
honor,
if
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
no.
once
again,
mr.
justice,
at
the
time
of
both
trials
there
is
this
problem
of
identity
of
robbers,
number
one,
two,
three
and
four.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
though
that
as
they
came
down
into
that
basement
that
one
of
the
robbers
had
i
believe
a
sawed-off
shotgun
which
was
described
as
perhaps
a
410.
the
other
two
had
pistols
of
a
smaller
caliber.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
the
evidence
is
essentially
that
at
the
second
trial
and
i
believe
at
the
first
trial
that
once
again
that
the
people
who
came
down
into
the
basement,
your
honor,
with
the
guns
forced
these
six
participants
in
the
card
games
to
go
over
against
the
wall
at
one
point.
they
then
forced
them
back
into
the
center
of
the
room,
had
all,
but
one
of
them
i
believe
removed
their
trousers
and
they
were
tied
together
at
that
point.
and
there
was
testimony
of
course
by
each
one
of
the
witnesses
as
to
the
various
people
who
came
around
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
yes.
except
for
the
modifications
that
were
indicated
by
mr.
clifford
in
his
statement
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
yes
sir.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
with
the
exception
your
honor
that
the
question
of
identification
was
developed
much
more
extensively
at
the
second
trial.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
and
in
addition
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
i
don't
know
but
i
think
it's
quite
obvious,
your
honor,
that
this
is
one
of
the
problems
apparently
that
it
concerned
the
prosecutor
at
the
first
trial.
it
was
the
same
prosecutor
at
the
two
trials.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
but
under
the
test
of
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
i'm
suggesting
that
there
is
protection
to
this
man
though
your
honor,
by
virtue
of
a
--
if
you
will,
a
fundamental
unfairness
type
test.
and
i
cannot
tell
this
court
whether
it
arises
upon
the
second
trial
or
the
third
trial
or
the
fourth
trial.
i
submit
that
depends
upon
the
facts
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
i
would
suggest
that
that's
not
necessarily
a
conclusion
that
must
follow
from
benton.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
yes
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
once
again,
your
honor,
i've
suggested
that
i
do
not
feel
that
i
can
indicate
a
mathematical
number
to
this
court.
but
i
think
that
the
protection
which
does
extend
to
this
defendant
would
be
a
protection
under
a
fundamental
unfairness
and
perhaps
this
court
may
well
conclude
on
the
facts
of
this
case
that
that
arose
at
the
conclusion
of
the
first
trial
or
it
may
conclude
that
the
--
after
the
second
trial
it
arose.
but
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
there
was
not
any
substantial
delay
between
the
first
trial
and
the
second
trial
as
was
present
in
the
case
of
hoag,
there
was
almost
two
years
elapsed
between
the
first
trial
and
the
second
trial
in
that
situation.
i
am
further
suggesting
that
there
was
no
showing
or
indication
in
the
record
that
by
virtue
of
the
delay
or
the
second
trial
that
the
defendant
lost
any
witnesses
or
had
any
difficulty
procuring
any
evidence
which
might
have
been
available
to
him
otherwise.
and
these
are
some
of
the
factors
which
i
submit,
mr.
justice,
would
we
considered
in
that
total
question
of
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
a
fundamental
unfairness
and
we
submit
under
that
facts
here
involved
that
there
was
not.
the
record
indicates
clearly
that
defense
counsel
had
the
benefit
of
the
transcript,
of
the
testimony
of
witnesses
at
the
preliminary
hearing
that
he
was
able
to
use
in
cross-examination.
he
apparently
had
the
benefit
of
their
testimony
at
the
first
trial
that
he
was
able
to
use
in
cross-examination
for
purposes
of
impeachment.
and
so,
under
those
circumstances,
where
you
do
have
two
separate
and
distinct
crimes,
i
submit
that
the
second
trial
presented
on
the
facts
of
this
case
did
not
rise
to
the
level
of
fundamental
unfairness.
we
further
submit
that
it
does
not
constitute
double
jeopardy
under
the
test
that
had
traditionally
been
used
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
that
identity
of
offense
that
results
in
a
person
being
placed
twice
in
jeopardy.
finally,
i
suppose
we
come
to
the
issue
then
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
collateral
estoppel
that
is
applicable
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
we
suggest
very
simply
first
of
all
that
there
has
not
a
collateral
estoppel
because
the
ultimate
fact
that
was
determined
at
the
first
trial
was
whether
or
not
ashe
robbed
knight.
we
submit
that
there
was
not
any
determination
of
merely
evidentiary
facts
or
merely
evidentiary
matters
and
that
since
that
ultimate
fact
is
not
therefore
conclusive
on
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
he
robbed
roberts
on
the
separate,
second
separate
and
distinct
offense
that
collateral
estoppel
is
not
applicable
upon
the
facts
of
the
case,
but
perhaps
more
importantly,
we
suggest
that
collateral
estoppel
need
not
be
applied
by
this
court
simply
because
as
indicated
in
this
court's
decision
in
hoag
versus
new
jersey
there
was
a
reluctance
to
declare
the
principle
of
collateral
estoppel
as
a
constitutional
principle
that
was
applicable
to
the
state
action
and
we
submit
that
the
same
reasoning
which
was
applied
by
the
court
at
that
time
should
once
again
be
applied
by
the
court
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
well
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
if
on
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
your
honor,
i
must
frankly
say,
i
do
not
think
that
that
question
has
been
adjudicated
by
the
courts
of
missouri
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
i
frankly,
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
yes,
sir
and
i
would
suggest
that
under
those
circumstances
if
there
were
express
findings
of
fact
that
the
principle
of
collateral
estoppel
would
be
applicable
without
getting
into
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
principle
of
collateral
estoppel
rises
to
the
level
of
being
constitutional
applicable.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
as
i
understand
it
your
honor
it
has
been
applied
(voice
overlap)
situations.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
the
cases
which
i
have
examined
on
that
question,
your
honor,
deal
with
it
i
believe
as
a
principle
of
collateral
estoppel
without
elevating
it
necessarily
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
guarantee.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
obviously,
my
view
has
to
be
in
this
case,
your
honor,
that
collateral
estoppel
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
guarantee.
that
collateral
estoppel
may
well
be
applied
by
this
court
in
the
federal
court
cases
as
a
part
of
its
supervisory
power
but
that
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
that's
right,
your
honor
because
it
is
collateral
estoppel
i
would
submit
is
not
a
part
of
the
definition
of
double
jeopardy
as
would
be
applied
by
our
constitution.
mr.
gene
e.
voigts
for
those
reasons
then,
we
would
submit
that
this
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit;
first,
on
the
basis
that
the
actions
here
brought
in
question
did
not
constitute
a
fundamental
unfairness
to
the
petitioner.
secondly,
that
although
the
fifth
amendment
prohibition
against
double
jeopardy
is
applicable
to
the
states
that
nonetheless
there
were
two
separate
and
distinct
offenses
involved
in
this
particular
case.
finally,
we
would
suggest
that
collateral
estoppel
is
not
applicable
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
and
even
if
this
court
should
so
find
that
it
is
not
constitutionally
required.
for
those
reasons
we
would
ask
affirmance
of
the
opinion
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
thank
you
mr.
justice.
