mr.
clifford,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
fully
understand
the
facts,
it
is
--
i
think
you
said
and
did
i
understand
it
correctly
that
these
men
not
only
scooped
up
what
was
on
the
table,
but
also
personally
went
into
the
pockets
of
each
one
of
the
players?
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
the
state's
theory
at
all
that
four
men
were
involved,
but
that
only
three
came
in
to
the
basement
and
that
the
other
was
the
driver
of
the
get
away
car,
or
anything
along
those
lines?
