mr.
clark
m.
clifford
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
bob
fred
ashe,
who
as
a
result
of
the
verdict
of
guilty
was
sentenced
to
a
35-year
term
in
the
missouri
state
penitentiary.
the
case
involves
the
construction
of
the
basic
theory
of
double
jeopardy.
in
this
action,
four
men
were
charged
with
holding
up
a
poker
game
and
as
a
result
of
that,
informations
were
returned,
charging
each
of
the
four
alleged
robbers
with
six
separate
offenses
because
there
were
six
men
in
the
poker
game,
each
was
robbed.
so,
each
of
the
four
defendants
was
charged
with
a
separate
offense.
in
this
instance
ashe,
my
client,
was
tried
and
acquitted
at
his
first
trial.
he
then
was
tried
a
second
time
and
that
time
he
was
convicted.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
of
paramount
importance.
so,
the
court
will
bear
with
me
while
i
trace
briefly
what
these
facts
are.
in
this
town,
in
the
northern
western
portion
of
missouri
called
lee's
summit,
was
known
from
time
to
time
a
group
gathered
to
play
poker
at
the
home
of
a
man
named
gladson
and
on
this
saturday
evening,
there
were
six
men
playing.
it
was
a
game
in
which
bets
were
made
as
much
as
a
hundred
dollars.
so,
from
time
to
time
there
would
be
a
good
deal
of
money
on
the
poker
table.
early
that
morning,
it
would
be
early
sunday
morning
on
january
10,
1960,
there
was
a
disturbance
at
the
door
which
led
into
the
basement
of
mr.
gladson's
house
where
they
were
having
the
game.
one
of
the
men
got
up,
the
door
was
pushed
open
in
his
face
and
three
men
entered,
one
of
them
with
a
shotgun
and
two
of
them
with
pistols.
they
said,
“this
is
a
stickup.”
they
forced
the
six
poker
players
over
with
their
backs
to
the
wall.
these
men
gathered
up
the
bills
and
currency
that
were
lying
on
the
table.
they
removed
from
the
persons
of
the
six
pokers
player
their
watches,
any
other
valuables
that
they
might
have.
when
the
case
came
to
trial
against
my
client
ashe,
he
was
charged
with
armed
robbery
against
one
of
the
six
poker
players
whose
name
was
knight.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes,
your
honor
and
i
was
going
to
give
you
more
detail
on
that
regard.
i
first
stated
the
general
proposition.
they
forced
the
six
men
over
with
their
back
facing
the
wall
with
their
backs
to
the
room.
they
took
whatever
cash
and
valuables
there
were
on
the
table.
then,
in
each
instance,
they
removed
from
the
person
of
the
six
poker
players,
their
watches,
their
rings,
their
billfolds,
whatever
they
could
find
of
value
on
the
six
men
who
were
there.
the
question
is
a
curious
one
as
to
whether
there
were
three
or
four
of
the
alleged
robbers
who
came
in,
but
in
any
event,
after
they
had
performed
this
robbery,
these
men
were
tied
up.
their
trousers
were
taken
away
from
them
in
an
effort
perhaps
to
prevent
pursuit
and
the
robbers
left.
so
that
just
taking
ashe
alone,
the
petitioner
here,
he
had
six
informations
filed
against
him,
alleging
these
six
offenses
against
the
poker
players.
so
when
the
first
trial
came
on,
four
of
the
poker
players
were
called
as
witnesses
among
a
number
of
other
witnesses.
the
fact
is
15
witnesses
were
called
by
the
state
in
this
first
trial
against
ashe.
gladson
at
whose
house
the
game
was
held
identified
one
of
the
robbers,
a
man
named
brown
because
as
the
robbers
came
in
they
had
hats
on,
they
had
bandanas
around
their
face
and
were
difficult
to
identify.
but
in
the
course
of
the
proceedings,
brown's
bandanna
fell
down
and
gladson
identified
him
and
knew
him
there
in
town.
so,
he
identified
him
but
could
not
identify
any
of
the
others.
knight,
the
second
witness
at
the
first
trial,
said
he'd
heard
that
some
people
claim
there
were
four
men
in
the
holdup,
but
he
only
recalled
three
and
he
couldn't
identify
any
of
the
three.
mcclendon,
the
third
poker
player
said
that
he
remembered
only
three
men
in
the
basement
and
he
identified
all
three
of
them
as
johnson,
larson
and
brown.
he
was
asked
about
ashe
at
this
particular
case
and
said,
no,
he
couldn't
remember
seeing
ashe
in
the
basement
where
they
were
having
the
game.
roberts,
the
fourth
member
of
the
game,
did
identify
ashe
as
one
of
the
robbers,
but
in
a
curious
manner.
he
said,
“i
didn't
see
his
face
that
evening
in
the
room
where
the
poker
game
was
held.
i
couldn't
see
his
hands
because
these
men
all
had
gloves
on
and
i
really
couldn't
identify
his
voice,
but
ashe
was
one
of
the
robbers
and
he
is
sitting
over
there
at
the
trial
table
when
the
case
came
to
trial
and
that
is
ashe
and
he
was
one
of
them.”
from
there,
the
trial,
the
first
trial
went
then
to
the
question
that
the
robbers
escaped,
stole
one
of
the
cars
belonging
to
the
poker
players
and
escaped.
early
the
next
morning,
witnesses
saw
this
group
and
two
or
three
witnesses
saw
the
stolen
car
with
three
men
in
or
around
it,
one
lying
on
the
ground
next
to
it,
two
sitting
on
the
other
side.
and
the
next
morning,
sunday
morning,
maybe
8
o'clock
or
so,
these
three
men
were
picked
up,
that's
johnson,
larson
and
brown,
those
were
the
three
that
mcclendon
incidentally
had
recognized
in
the
basement.
they
were
picked
up
by
a
missouri
highway
patrolman.
ashe
was
not
with
those
three
men.
also,
these
three
men
picked
up
near
the
stolen
car,
all
had
money
on
them;
ones,
fives,
tens,
twenties,
something
that
kind;
the
same
kind
of
currency
that
had
been
used
in
the
poker
game.
when
the
stolen
car
was
found
near
which
one
witness
had
seen
these
three
men,
a
shotgun
was
found
some
few
steps
behind
the
car,
two
pistols
were
found
inside
of
the
car.
now,
sometime
later,
at
a
point
removed
from
this
location
where
these
three
men
were
found,
ashe
was
walking
along
the
highway.
and
a
separate
state
patrolman
who
was
driving
along,
saw
this
man
walking
along
the
highway,
stopped
him
and
the
word
had
gone
out
be
on
the
lookout
for
this
particular
fellow.
he
arrested
him
at
the
time,
had
him
come
over
and
stand
with
his
hands
against
the
automobile
and
searched
him.
all
ashe
had
on
at
that
time
was
a
pair
of
pants
and
a
white
shirt
and
the
officer
said
he
had
nothing
in
his
pockets,
he
had
no
money
of
any
kind.
i
mention
it
because
the
identification
of
ashe
was
extraordinarily
flimsy
from
the
witnesses
who
were
in
the
game.
the
case
against
the
other
three
who
were
supposedly
implicated
was
quite
strong
because
they
were
found
with
money
on
them.
they
pretty
well
stayed
together.
they'd
been
seen
near
the
car
and
so
forth.
ashe
was
separate.
all
at
one
might
know,
he
might
just
have
been
walking
down
the
highway
and
the
policeman
saw
him.
after
the
submission
of
the
case
to
the
jury,
the
defense
did
not
put
on
any
witnesses.
the
jury
went
out
and
brought
in
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
against
ashe.
incidentally
and
interestingly,
the
jury
was
given
a
verdict
which
said
not
guilty
and
they
added
to
it
not
guilty
due
to
insufficient
evidence,
they
supplied
that
themselves.
the
state
tried
the
case
on
the
theory
that
the
four
men
were
acting
in
concert
and
that
all
four
took
place
in
a
robbery
that
involved
all
six
poker
players.
no
effort
was
made
to
show
that
any
particular
defendant
robbed
any
particular
poker
player
fact
is
there
is
some
evidence
exactly
to
the
opposite
when
one
witness
said,
“i
don't
know
which
men
of
the
four
or
three
did
what.
we
were
just
all
herded
over
there
and
we
just
saw
them
scooping
up
the
money.”
so
there
is
no
specific
act
on
the
part
of
any
defendant
alleged.
it
is
merely
that
four
men
acting
in
concert
robbed
each
of
the
six
men.
so
that's
why
all
four
of
the
alleged
robbers
each
had
informations
issued
against
them
for
all
six
poker
players.
now,
in
the
case,
the
first
trial
of
ashe,
there
was
only
one
issue
in
the
case.
the
issue
was,
was
ashe
one
of
the
robbers
who
was
in
the
basement
that
evening?
there
is
no
doubt
about
what
else
took
place.
there's
no
doubt
that
the
poker
game
took
place.
there's
no
doubt
that
some
robbers
came
in
with
guns.
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
substantial
amount
of
money,
maybe
as
much
as
two
thousand
dollars
or
so
was
taken
from
the
table.
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
lost
personal
property.
all
of
that
is
uncontroverted,
went
in,
very
little
cross-examination,
no
contradiction.
so,
we
have
those
facts
established
without
any
doubt
or
question.
the
one
real
question,
however
was,
was
ashe
one
of
the
men?
it
was
slightly
complicated
by
mcclendon
for
instance
saying,
“there
were
only
three
men
and
they
were
johnson,
larson
and
brown
and
i
didn't
see
ashe.”
other
men
said,
“well,
i
don't
know
who
there
was.”
so
that
whereby
time
the
jury
had
to
consider,
a
reading
of
the
record
shows
they
really
had
one
issue
submitted
to
them.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
it
was
not
explained.
the
state
alleged
that
there
were
these
four
men
and
--
but
the
three
came
in
all
alone
and
then
one
came
in
afterwards,
there
was
a
good
deal
of
confusion,
but
the
state's
charge
was
in
effect,
there
were
actually
four
robbers
at
some
time
or
another
in
the
basement.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
it
is
not
uncommon.
i'm
sure
that
with
the
excitement
of
the
moment,
with
these
men
coming
in,
the
fact
that
they
had
their
faces
concealed,
i
think
all
of
that
is
likely
to
create
difficulty
in
identification,
i
accept
that.
however,
the
fact
is
that
when
the
state
brought
its
first
case
against
ashe,
all
of
the
facts
of
the
game,
all
of
the
facts
of
the
holdup,
all
of
the
facts
of
the
loss
by
each
of
the
six
was
all
put
into
the
case
and
the
one
real
question
the
jury
had
to
determine
is,
was
ashe
one
of
the
four
men?
the
jury
concluded
from
the
reading
of
the
record,
--
jury
concluded
after
the
case,
i
concluded
also
from
the
reading
of
the
record
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
associate
him
with
the
case,
the
jury
found
him
not
guilty.
thereafter,
in
the
case
--
the
state
proceeded
on
the
second
information
against
ashe.
the
first
charged
him
with
robbing
knight.
an
identical
information
then
was
used
as
the
basis
of
the
second
trial,
it
charged
him
with
robbing
a
man
named
roberts
and
the
case
came
on
for
trial.
now,
i
submit
to
you
as
i
read
the
appendix
of
the
second
trial,
i
found
it
a
shocking
experience.
the
case
had
changed
very
considerably.
gladson,
who
at
the
first
trial
had
said,
“i
could
only
identify
brown
because
his
mask
fell
off”
now
says,
“yes,
ashe
was
one
of
the
robbery,”
just
a
flat
categorical
statement.
he
was
tied
up
with
the
fact
that
i
--
“when
i
saw
the
four
men
at
the
police
station
the
next
day,
i
could
see
those
were
the
four
and
ashe
was
one
of
them”
so
he
then
changes
his
story.
he
apparently
knew
more
about
what
happened
that
night
at
the
second
trial
than
he
knew
after
the
first
trial.
knight,
who
didn't
know
anybody
at
the
first
trial,
maintained
his
same
position.
he
didn't
know
anybody
at
the
second
trial.
mcclendon,
the
man
who'd
at
the
first
trial
had
said
there
were
only
three
men
and
they
were
johnson,
larson
and
brown
was
not
called
by
the
state
the
second
time
because
he
had
been
so
positive
about
the
identity
of
the
three
robbers
which
did
not
--
his
identification
did
not
include
ashe
so
he
was
not
called
by
the
state.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
there
was
not.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
six
and
a
half
weeks.
roberts,
the
fourth
man,
called
again
although
still,
having
difficulty
with
the
fact
that
the
mask
were
on,
he
also
flatly
said
that
he
identified
ashe.
and
he
now,
between
the
first
and
second
trials,
had
concluded
that
he
had
identified
him
as
a
result
of
a
--
of
his
voice
which
he
had
not
done
at
the
first
trial.
now,
in
that
case
after
this
finding,
the
case
went
on
and
obviously,
as
you
look
through
the
record,
you
would
see
a
process
going
on.
witness'
stories
are
strengthened.
they
pick
up
little
details
here
that
they
testified
to
it
the
second
trial
which
they
didn't
at
the
first
trial,
weak
places
are
bolstered
up,
here
is
a
perfect
illustration.
obviously,
the
prosecution
was
very
concerned
that
when
ashe
was
picked
up,
he
just
had
pair
of
trousers
and
a
shirt
on
and
had
no
money
of
any
kind
on
him.
so,
at
the
second
trial,
an
effort
was
made
to
show
that
he
did
have
some
money
on
him,
but
they
couldn't
get
around
the
first
statement
of
the
highway
patrolman
that
he
had
searched
ashe
and
found
nothing
on
him.
so,
they
put
on
a
deputy
sheriff
who
was
at
the
jail
in
jackson
county
and
this
it
seems
to
me
is
really
quite
significant.
i
want
to
read
just
two
or
three
questions
and
answers.
he
said
he
had
found
some
money
on
ashe.
where
was
the
money?
answer,
“in
his
pocket.
he
had
some
in
his
coat
pocket,
i
think.”
question;
“did
he
have
some
in
his
shoe
or
sock?”
“that
is
a
mistake
i
made.
i
got
it
all
out
of
the
pocket
of
his
coat.”
well,
that's
a
little
troublesome
to
the
state
because
he
never
had
a
coat.
they
found
him
at
the
very
beginning
with
just
pants
and
shirt
and
he'd
never
had
a
coat
on.
then
this,
“didn't
you
tell
me
prior
to
this,
you
took
it
out
of
his
shoe?”
answer,
“no,
i
said
i
made
him
take
his
shoes
and
socks
off.
that
was
a
misunderstanding
because
i
have
heard
it
four
or
five
times.”
sometime
between
the
first
trial
and
the
second
trial,
this
particular
witness
had
had
suggested
to
him
four
or
five
times
that
he
had
found
some
money
in
ashe's
shoe
between
his
sock
and
his
shoe
because
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
kind
about
any
money
in
his
shoe
in
the
first
one.
and
to
compound
what
i
believe
is
the
gross
injustice
here,
although,
this
witness's
name
is
autoray,
the
deputy
sheriff
who
took
his
shoes
and
socks
off,
had
testified
at
the
first
trial
and
said
nothing
about
finding
any
money
in
his
shoe
and
sock
at
the
first
trial.
the
prosecutor
at
the
second
trial
was
very
anxious
to
get
this
deputy
sheriff
to
say
that
and
when
he
wouldn't
say
it,
then
the
deputy
sheriff
claimed
surprise
and
asked
leave
to
cross-examine
him
as
a
hostile
witness
although
he
had
testified
six
weeks
before
at
another
first
trial
and
never
mentioned
about
the
money
in
the
shoe.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes,
and
the
court
permitted
him
to
do
it
and
eight
pages
in
this
appendix
is
devoted
to
the
prosecuting
attorney
trying
to
get
this
deputy
sheriff
to
say
that
he'd
found
the
money
in
his
shoe.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes,
fine.
what
i'm
--
they
did
your
honor
and
the
second
time,
they
said,
they
brought
in
the
verdict
of
guilty
and
it
was
under
that
guilty
finding
that
he
was
sentenced
to
serve
the
term
in
the
penitentiary.
now,
the
point
is
that
it
is
our
contention
in
behalf
of
ashe
that
the
substance,
the
thrust
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
carried
over
into
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
after
he
was
acquitted
of
the
first
charge,
when
there
was
only
one
real
issue
and
that
is
“was
ashe
there,”
that
that
then
became
the
finding
of
the
jury
and
he
should
not
have
been
tried
again
on
that
issue,
that
is
the
contention
that
we
make.
now,
in
this
regard,
when
our
brief
was
filed,
there
was
a
federal
rule
regarding
the
application
of
double
jeopardy
and
a
state
rule.
it
was
perhaps
best
stated
by
the
decision
in
state
versus
palko,
justice
cardozo,
it
seems
to
me.
no,
alright,
state
versus
palko
where
it
was
alleged
and
held
that
there
was
one
rule
for
federal
cases
and
one
rule
for
state
cases
and
in
the
state
case
a
very
watered
down
requirement
was
leveled
against
the
state.
i
think
it
was
judge
cardo
--
justice
cardozo
in
the
palko
case
who
said,
“we
will
not
disturb
a
second
finding
of
guilty
in
a
state
case
unless
the
hardship
is
so
shocking
and
acute
as
to
be
unendurable.”
that
is
the
substantial
language
in
--
and
the
palko
decision
was
followed
for
quite
a
long
time.
now,
that
was
changed,
but
i'll
get
to
that.
we
contend
that
in
even
in
this
instance,
when
there
is
but
one
issue
in
a
case
and
the
state
has
full
opportunity
to
present
its
case
and
the
one
clear
issue
is
decided
in
favor
of
the
defendant
in
that
case,
that
he
should
not
be
tried
again
for
the
charge
for
which
the
jury
has
obviously
found
one
positive
result.
so,
we
say
that
even
if
palko
were
the
law
today,
with
this
watered
down
requirement,
i
believe
that
this
case
still
would
come
under
the
rule
enunciated
in
palko,
but,
the
palko
case
is
no
longer
controlling
in
this
regard
because
of
the
case
of
benton
versus
maryland
in
which
justice
marshall
wrote
the
opinion
just
june
of
this
year.
and
in
that
opinion,
this
court
said
that
the
double
jeopardy
concept,
the
double
jeopardy
theory,
the
core
of
the
concept
of
double
jeopardy
applies
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment.
so,
one
cannot
read
the
benton
versus
maryland
without
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
now
this
court
has
stated
there
are
no
longer
two
rules,
one
for
state
cases
and
one
for
federal
cases.
there
is
just
one
rule
now
and
that
is
for
the
federal
rule
because
as
the
opinion
of
judge
marshall
said
that
the
basic
protection
of
double
jeopardy
is
so
thoroughly
ingrained
in
our
law
that
it
was
present
even
at
the
common
law
before
it
was
enshrined
in
the
fifth
amendment.
and,
therefore,
that
you
cannot
permit
an
individual
when
his
constitutional
rights
are
being
grossly
affected
as
i
believe
this
defendant's
were,
to
have
a
court
say,
“well,
we'll
apply
one
rule
to
that
man
on
the
double
jeopardy
question
and
another
rule
if
his
case
was
in
a
federal
court.”
i
see
that
i
have
at
five
minutes
left
and
i
would
like
to
use
the
five
minutes
after
my
colleague
has
argued.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
wish
to
make
three
points
and
i
must
touch
them
lightly
because
i
want
to
get
them
all
in
the
five
minutes
i
have
left.
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
white;
the
federal
court
for
a
long
time
has
distinguished
between
a
strict
double
jeopardy
case
and
what
we
will
call
a
double
jeopardy
situation.
the
benton
case
was
one
where
a
defendant
had
been
found
guilty
of
both
burglary
and
larceny
and
when
he
was
or
had
been
charged
with
burglary
and
larceny
and
on
trial
had
been
acquitted
of
larceny.
the
court
held
he
could
not
be
charged
or
tried
again
on
larceny
because
it
was
now
the
federal
rule
was
applying
and
it
was
double
jeopardy.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
it
did
not
in
that
instance.
now,
this
court,
the
supreme
court,
and
many
of
the
court
of
appeals,
federal
courts
of
appeals
have
met
the
question
of
what
do
you
do
in
a
double
jeopardy
situation
when
it
is
not
the
exact
charge
that
is
being
directed
against
the
defendant
for
the
second
time?
they
have
in
that
instance
resorted
to
the
accepted
rule
of
collateral
estoppel
and
they
have
said
many
times
that
when
the
facts
of
a
case
show
clearly
that
there
is
one
major
thrust
to
the
state's
evidence
and
the
defendant
has
met
that
and
has
been
acquitted
on
that
one
major
point,
then
we
are
not
going
to
make
him
run
the
gauntlet
again.
it
compares
collateral
estoppel
with
the
theory
of
res
judicata.
the
chief
justice
himself
in
the
watts
case
recognized
the
application
of
collateral
estoppel
to
a
federal
criminal
case.
justice
douglas
referred
to
it
in
the
sealfon
sugar
case
and
there
it
was
applied.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
it
was
not,
it
was
not,
but
it
was
--
on
those
particular
facts
he
said
that
this
should
apply.
justice
holmes
did
it
in
oppenheimer
case.
there
is
an
excellent
review
of
the
whole
question
of
collateral
estoppel
in
the
kramer
case
where
judge
friendly
of
the
second
circuit
analyzes
the
whole
matter
and
says
that
it
should
be
used
in
federal
cases
when
it's
appliable.
and
under
the
benton
decision,
this
case
now
must
be
looked
at
in
the
light
of
the
federal
rule
and
not
the
old
state
rule
which
has
now
become
archaic.
second
quick
point,
the
state
of
missouri,
in
the
supreme
court
of
missouri,
in
the
federal
district
court,
in
the
federal
court
of
appeals
and
here
has
cited
the
hoag
case
as
its
authority
for
forcing
this
man
to
serve
this
sentence
when
he
was
tried
on
exactly
the
same
issue.
a
quick
comment
on
the
hoag
case;
that
was
a
case
tried
in
new
jersey.
it
so
happens
that
justice
brennan
sat
in
that
case,
it
was
a
four
to
three
decision.
justice
brennan
dissented
in
that
case,
it
was
a
holdup
case
like
this
one.
that
case
came
on
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
justice
brennan
abstained
and
it
was
a
five
to
three
decision
here.
if
he
had
voted
i
assume
it
would
be
five
to
four.
so,
we
have
a
case
that's
four
to
three
in
new
jersey
and
would
have
been
five
to
four
in
this
case,
i
believe
had
he
voted.
now,
they
can
no
longer
use
the
hoag
case
i
submit
to
your
honor.
one;
the
hoag
case
has
been
repudiated
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
in
the
kermeyer
(ph)
case
and
they
specifically
referred
to
the
hoag
case
in
the
kermeyer
case
and
suggest
they're
not
going
to
follow
that
rule
any
longer.
and
the
language
of
the
kermeyer
decision
now
in
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
is
that
collateral
estoppel
should
be
ungrudgingly
applied
in
this
type
of
case.
also,
i
submit
to
you,
hoag
is
no
longer
an
authority
in
this
case
because
benton
has
changed
hoag
also.
because
hoag
comments
on
the
fact
that
there
are
two
rules,
one
rule
that
is
quite
beneficial
to
defendants
in
federal
cases
and
one
that
really
hardly
at
all
as
to
state
cases.
also,
in
the
hoag
case,
this
court
said
we're
not
going
to
go
behind
the
finding
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
and
look
into
that
record.
we
don't
want
to
do
that
to
state
courts,
that
was
under
the
old
rule.
you
can
do
it
now
because
it
is
under
the
federal
rule
and
you
have
the
right
to
look.
so,
i
say
hoag
is
no
longer
an
authority
for
the
case.
last
comment;
sometimes
when
you
go
through
a
record
of
this
kind
and
look
at
it,
it's
murky,
it's
difficult
to
find
out
really
what
happened.
occasionally,
you
come
to
a
door
and
you
open
the
door
and
let
light
right
on
in,
that
happened
in
this
case.
and,
i
refer
your
honors
to
what
happened
just
before
this
second
case
was
tried.
after
he
was
acquitted
the
first
time,
there
was
a
colloquy
between
the
trial
judge
and
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
and
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
that
that
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes
sir,
it's
107
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
its
107
your
honor
and
i
just
want
to
say
this.
if
the
judge
said
in
view
of
the
wide
publicity
that's
attended
this
case,
the
fact
that
the
co-defendants
have
been
tried
and
convicted,
so
that
by
time
this
fellow
came
to
trial
the
second
time,
he'd
had
one
trial,
the
other
three
had
been
tried
and
acquitted
with
resulting
publicity
and
yet
the
state
of
missouri
said
that
original
acquittal
meant
absolutely
nothing
to
us
or
to
this
man.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
bob
fred
ashe,
who
as
a
result
of
the
verdict
of
guilty
was
sentenced
to
a
35-year
term
in
the
missouri
state
penitentiary.
the
case
involves
the
construction
of
the
basic
theory
of
double
jeopardy.
in
this
action,
four
men
were
charged
with
holding
up
a
poker
game
and
as
a
result
of
that,
informations
were
returned,
charging
each
of
the
four
alleged
robbers
with
six
separate
offenses
because
there
were
six
men
in
the
poker
game,
each
was
robbed.
so,
each
of
the
four
defendants
was
charged
with
a
separate
offense.
in
this
instance
ashe,
my
client,
was
tried
and
acquitted
at
his
first
trial.
he
then
was
tried
a
second
time
and
that
time
he
was
convicted.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
of
paramount
importance.
so,
the
court
will
bear
with
me
while
i
trace
briefly
what
these
facts
are.
in
this
town,
in
the
northern
western
portion
of
missouri
called
lee's
summit,
was
known
from
time
to
time
a
group
gathered
to
play
poker
at
the
home
of
a
man
named
gladson
and
on
this
saturday
evening,
there
were
six
men
playing.
it
was
a
game
in
which
bets
were
made
as
much
as
a
hundred
dollars.
so,
from
time
to
time
there
would
be
a
good
deal
of
money
on
the
poker
table.
early
that
morning,
it
would
be
early
sunday
morning
on
january
10,
1960,
there
was
a
disturbance
at
the
door
which
led
into
the
basement
of
mr.
gladson's
house
where
they
were
having
the
game.
one
of
the
men
got
up,
the
door
was
pushed
open
in
his
face
and
three
men
entered,
one
of
them
with
a
shotgun
and
two
of
them
with
pistols.
they
said,
“this
is
a
stickup.”
they
forced
the
six
poker
players
over
with
their
backs
to
the
wall.
these
men
gathered
up
the
bills
and
currency
that
were
lying
on
the
table.
they
removed
from
the
persons
of
the
six
pokers
player
their
watches,
any
other
valuables
that
they
might
have.
when
the
case
came
to
trial
against
my
client
ashe,
he
was
charged
with
armed
robbery
against
one
of
the
six
poker
players
whose
name
was
knight.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes,
your
honor
and
i
was
going
to
give
you
more
detail
on
that
regard.
i
first
stated
the
general
proposition.
they
forced
the
six
men
over
with
their
back
facing
the
wall
with
their
backs
to
the
room.
they
took
whatever
cash
and
valuables
there
were
on
the
table.
then,
in
each
instance,
they
removed
from
the
person
of
the
six
poker
players,
their
watches,
their
rings,
their
billfolds,
whatever
they
could
find
of
value
on
the
six
men
who
were
there.
the
question
is
a
curious
one
as
to
whether
there
were
three
or
four
of
the
alleged
robbers
who
came
in,
but
in
any
event,
after
they
had
performed
this
robbery,
these
men
were
tied
up.
their
trousers
were
taken
away
from
them
in
an
effort
perhaps
to
prevent
pursuit
and
the
robbers
left.
so
that
just
taking
ashe
alone,
the
petitioner
here,
he
had
six
informations
filed
against
him,
alleging
these
six
offenses
against
the
poker
players.
so
when
the
first
trial
came
on,
four
of
the
poker
players
were
called
as
witnesses
among
a
number
of
other
witnesses.
the
fact
is
15
witnesses
were
called
by
the
state
in
this
first
trial
against
ashe.
gladson
at
whose
house
the
game
was
held
identified
one
of
the
robbers,
a
man
named
brown
because
as
the
robbers
came
in
they
had
hats
on,
they
had
bandanas
around
their
face
and
were
difficult
to
identify.
but
in
the
course
of
the
proceedings,
brown's
bandanna
fell
down
and
gladson
identified
him
and
knew
him
there
in
town.
so,
he
identified
him
but
could
not
identify
any
of
the
others.
knight,
the
second
witness
at
the
first
trial,
said
he'd
heard
that
some
people
claim
there
were
four
men
in
the
holdup,
but
he
only
recalled
three
and
he
couldn't
identify
any
of
the
three.
mcclendon,
the
third
poker
player
said
that
he
remembered
only
three
men
in
the
basement
and
he
identified
all
three
of
them
as
johnson,
larson
and
brown.
he
was
asked
about
ashe
at
this
particular
case
and
said,
no,
he
couldn't
remember
seeing
ashe
in
the
basement
where
they
were
having
the
game.
roberts,
the
fourth
member
of
the
game,
did
identify
ashe
as
one
of
the
robbers,
but
in
a
curious
manner.
he
said,
“i
didn't
see
his
face
that
evening
in
the
room
where
the
poker
game
was
held.
i
couldn't
see
his
hands
because
these
men
all
had
gloves
on
and
i
really
couldn't
identify
his
voice,
but
ashe
was
one
of
the
robbers
and
he
is
sitting
over
there
at
the
trial
table
when
the
case
came
to
trial
and
that
is
ashe
and
he
was
one
of
them.”
from
there,
the
trial,
the
first
trial
went
then
to
the
question
that
the
robbers
escaped,
stole
one
of
the
cars
belonging
to
the
poker
players
and
escaped.
early
the
next
morning,
witnesses
saw
this
group
and
two
or
three
witnesses
saw
the
stolen
car
with
three
men
in
or
around
it,
one
lying
on
the
ground
next
to
it,
two
sitting
on
the
other
side.
and
the
next
morning,
sunday
morning,
maybe
8
o'clock
or
so,
these
three
men
were
picked
up,
that's
johnson,
larson
and
brown,
those
were
the
three
that
mcclendon
incidentally
had
recognized
in
the
basement.
they
were
picked
up
by
a
missouri
highway
patrolman.
ashe
was
not
with
those
three
men.
also,
these
three
men
picked
up
near
the
stolen
car,
all
had
money
on
them;
ones,
fives,
tens,
twenties,
something
that
kind;
the
same
kind
of
currency
that
had
been
used
in
the
poker
game.
when
the
stolen
car
was
found
near
which
one
witness
had
seen
these
three
men,
a
shotgun
was
found
some
few
steps
behind
the
car,
two
pistols
were
found
inside
of
the
car.
now,
sometime
later,
at
a
point
removed
from
this
location
where
these
three
men
were
found,
ashe
was
walking
along
the
highway.
and
a
separate
state
patrolman
who
was
driving
along,
saw
this
man
walking
along
the
highway,
stopped
him
and
the
word
had
gone
out
be
on
the
lookout
for
this
particular
fellow.
he
arrested
him
at
the
time,
had
him
come
over
and
stand
with
his
hands
against
the
automobile
and
searched
him.
all
ashe
had
on
at
that
time
was
a
pair
of
pants
and
a
white
shirt
and
the
officer
said
he
had
nothing
in
his
pockets,
he
had
no
money
of
any
kind.
i
mention
it
because
the
identification
of
ashe
was
extraordinarily
flimsy
from
the
witnesses
who
were
in
the
game.
the
case
against
the
other
three
who
were
supposedly
implicated
was
quite
strong
because
they
were
found
with
money
on
them.
they
pretty
well
stayed
together.
they'd
been
seen
near
the
car
and
so
forth.
ashe
was
separate.
all
at
one
might
know,
he
might
just
have
been
walking
down
the
highway
and
the
policeman
saw
him.
after
the
submission
of
the
case
to
the
jury,
the
defense
did
not
put
on
any
witnesses.
the
jury
went
out
and
brought
in
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
against
ashe.
incidentally
and
interestingly,
the
jury
was
given
a
verdict
which
said
not
guilty
and
they
added
to
it
not
guilty
due
to
insufficient
evidence,
they
supplied
that
themselves.
the
state
tried
the
case
on
the
theory
that
the
four
men
were
acting
in
concert
and
that
all
four
took
place
in
a
robbery
that
involved
all
six
poker
players.
no
effort
was
made
to
show
that
any
particular
defendant
robbed
any
particular
poker
player
fact
is
there
is
some
evidence
exactly
to
the
opposite
when
one
witness
said,
“i
don't
know
which
men
of
the
four
or
three
did
what.
we
were
just
all
herded
over
there
and
we
just
saw
them
scooping
up
the
money.”
so
there
is
no
specific
act
on
the
part
of
any
defendant
alleged.
it
is
merely
that
four
men
acting
in
concert
robbed
each
of
the
six
men.
so
that's
why
all
four
of
the
alleged
robbers
each
had
informations
issued
against
them
for
all
six
poker
players.
now,
in
the
case,
the
first
trial
of
ashe,
there
was
only
one
issue
in
the
case.
the
issue
was,
was
ashe
one
of
the
robbers
who
was
in
the
basement
that
evening?
there
is
no
doubt
about
what
else
took
place.
there's
no
doubt
that
the
poker
game
took
place.
there's
no
doubt
that
some
robbers
came
in
with
guns.
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
substantial
amount
of
money,
maybe
as
much
as
two
thousand
dollars
or
so
was
taken
from
the
table.
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
lost
personal
property.
all
of
that
is
uncontroverted,
went
in,
very
little
cross-examination,
no
contradiction.
so,
we
have
those
facts
established
without
any
doubt
or
question.
the
one
real
question,
however
was,
was
ashe
one
of
the
men?
it
was
slightly
complicated
by
mcclendon
for
instance
saying,
“there
were
only
three
men
and
they
were
johnson,
larson
and
brown
and
i
didn't
see
ashe.”
other
men
said,
“well,
i
don't
know
who
there
was.”
so
that
whereby
time
the
jury
had
to
consider,
a
reading
of
the
record
shows
they
really
had
one
issue
submitted
to
them.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
it
was
not
explained.
the
state
alleged
that
there
were
these
four
men
and
--
but
the
three
came
in
all
alone
and
then
one
came
in
afterwards,
there
was
a
good
deal
of
confusion,
but
the
state's
charge
was
in
effect,
there
were
actually
four
robbers
at
some
time
or
another
in
the
basement.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
it
is
not
uncommon.
i'm
sure
that
with
the
excitement
of
the
moment,
with
these
men
coming
in,
the
fact
that
they
had
their
faces
concealed,
i
think
all
of
that
is
likely
to
create
difficulty
in
identification,
i
accept
that.
however,
the
fact
is
that
when
the
state
brought
its
first
case
against
ashe,
all
of
the
facts
of
the
game,
all
of
the
facts
of
the
holdup,
all
of
the
facts
of
the
loss
by
each
of
the
six
was
all
put
into
the
case
and
the
one
real
question
the
jury
had
to
determine
is,
was
ashe
one
of
the
four
men?
the
jury
concluded
from
the
reading
of
the
record,
--
jury
concluded
after
the
case,
i
concluded
also
from
the
reading
of
the
record
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
associate
him
with
the
case,
the
jury
found
him
not
guilty.
thereafter,
in
the
case
--
the
state
proceeded
on
the
second
information
against
ashe.
the
first
charged
him
with
robbing
knight.
an
identical
information
then
was
used
as
the
basis
of
the
second
trial,
it
charged
him
with
robbing
a
man
named
roberts
and
the
case
came
on
for
trial.
now,
i
submit
to
you
as
i
read
the
appendix
of
the
second
trial,
i
found
it
a
shocking
experience.
the
case
had
changed
very
considerably.
gladson,
who
at
the
first
trial
had
said,
“i
could
only
identify
brown
because
his
mask
fell
off”
now
says,
“yes,
ashe
was
one
of
the
robbery,”
just
a
flat
categorical
statement.
he
was
tied
up
with
the
fact
that
i
--
“when
i
saw
the
four
men
at
the
police
station
the
next
day,
i
could
see
those
were
the
four
and
ashe
was
one
of
them”
so
he
then
changes
his
story.
he
apparently
knew
more
about
what
happened
that
night
at
the
second
trial
than
he
knew
after
the
first
trial.
knight,
who
didn't
know
anybody
at
the
first
trial,
maintained
his
same
position.
he
didn't
know
anybody
at
the
second
trial.
mcclendon,
the
man
who'd
at
the
first
trial
had
said
there
were
only
three
men
and
they
were
johnson,
larson
and
brown
was
not
called
by
the
state
the
second
time
because
he
had
been
so
positive
about
the
identity
of
the
three
robbers
which
did
not
--
his
identification
did
not
include
ashe
so
he
was
not
called
by
the
state.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
there
was
not.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
six
and
a
half
weeks.
roberts,
the
fourth
man,
called
again
although
still,
having
difficulty
with
the
fact
that
the
mask
were
on,
he
also
flatly
said
that
he
identified
ashe.
and
he
now,
between
the
first
and
second
trials,
had
concluded
that
he
had
identified
him
as
a
result
of
a
--
of
his
voice
which
he
had
not
done
at
the
first
trial.
now,
in
that
case
after
this
finding,
the
case
went
on
and
obviously,
as
you
look
through
the
record,
you
would
see
a
process
going
on.
witness'
stories
are
strengthened.
they
pick
up
little
details
here
that
they
testified
to
it
the
second
trial
which
they
didn't
at
the
first
trial,
weak
places
are
bolstered
up,
here
is
a
perfect
illustration.
obviously,
the
prosecution
was
very
concerned
that
when
ashe
was
picked
up,
he
just
had
pair
of
trousers
and
a
shirt
on
and
had
no
money
of
any
kind
on
him.
so,
at
the
second
trial,
an
effort
was
made
to
show
that
he
did
have
some
money
on
him,
but
they
couldn't
get
around
the
first
statement
of
the
highway
patrolman
that
he
had
searched
ashe
and
found
nothing
on
him.
so,
they
put
on
a
deputy
sheriff
who
was
at
the
jail
in
jackson
county
and
this
it
seems
to
me
is
really
quite
significant.
i
want
to
read
just
two
or
three
questions
and
answers.
he
said
he
had
found
some
money
on
ashe.
where
was
the
money?
answer,
“in
his
pocket.
he
had
some
in
his
coat
pocket,
i
think.”
question;
“did
he
have
some
in
his
shoe
or
sock?”
“that
is
a
mistake
i
made.
i
got
it
all
out
of
the
pocket
of
his
coat.”
well,
that's
a
little
troublesome
to
the
state
because
he
never
had
a
coat.
they
found
him
at
the
very
beginning
with
just
pants
and
shirt
and
he'd
never
had
a
coat
on.
then
this,
“didn't
you
tell
me
prior
to
this,
you
took
it
out
of
his
shoe?”
answer,
“no,
i
said
i
made
him
take
his
shoes
and
socks
off.
that
was
a
misunderstanding
because
i
have
heard
it
four
or
five
times.”
sometime
between
the
first
trial
and
the
second
trial,
this
particular
witness
had
had
suggested
to
him
four
or
five
times
that
he
had
found
some
money
in
ashe's
shoe
between
his
sock
and
his
shoe
because
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
kind
about
any
money
in
his
shoe
in
the
first
one.
and
to
compound
what
i
believe
is
the
gross
injustice
here,
although,
this
witness's
name
is
autoray,
the
deputy
sheriff
who
took
his
shoes
and
socks
off,
had
testified
at
the
first
trial
and
said
nothing
about
finding
any
money
in
his
shoe
and
sock
at
the
first
trial.
the
prosecutor
at
the
second
trial
was
very
anxious
to
get
this
deputy
sheriff
to
say
that
and
when
he
wouldn't
say
it,
then
the
deputy
sheriff
claimed
surprise
and
asked
leave
to
cross-examine
him
as
a
hostile
witness
although
he
had
testified
six
weeks
before
at
another
first
trial
and
never
mentioned
about
the
money
in
the
shoe.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes,
and
the
court
permitted
him
to
do
it
and
eight
pages
in
this
appendix
is
devoted
to
the
prosecuting
attorney
trying
to
get
this
deputy
sheriff
to
say
that
he'd
found
the
money
in
his
shoe.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes,
fine.
what
i'm
--
they
did
your
honor
and
the
second
time,
they
said,
they
brought
in
the
verdict
of
guilty
and
it
was
under
that
guilty
finding
that
he
was
sentenced
to
serve
the
term
in
the
penitentiary.
now,
the
point
is
that
it
is
our
contention
in
behalf
of
ashe
that
the
substance,
the
thrust
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
carried
over
into
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
after
he
was
acquitted
of
the
first
charge,
when
there
was
only
one
real
issue
and
that
is
“was
ashe
there,”
that
that
then
became
the
finding
of
the
jury
and
he
should
not
have
been
tried
again
on
that
issue,
that
is
the
contention
that
we
make.
now,
in
this
regard,
when
our
brief
was
filed,
there
was
a
federal
rule
regarding
the
application
of
double
jeopardy
and
a
state
rule.
it
was
perhaps
best
stated
by
the
decision
in
state
versus
palko,
justice
cardozo,
it
seems
to
me.
no,
alright,
state
versus
palko
where
it
was
alleged
and
held
that
there
was
one
rule
for
federal
cases
and
one
rule
for
state
cases
and
in
the
state
case
a
very
watered
down
requirement
was
leveled
against
the
state.
i
think
it
was
judge
cardo
--
justice
cardozo
in
the
palko
case
who
said,
“we
will
not
disturb
a
second
finding
of
guilty
in
a
state
case
unless
the
hardship
is
so
shocking
and
acute
as
to
be
unendurable.”
that
is
the
substantial
language
in
--
and
the
palko
decision
was
followed
for
quite
a
long
time.
now,
that
was
changed,
but
i'll
get
to
that.
we
contend
that
in
even
in
this
instance,
when
there
is
but
one
issue
in
a
case
and
the
state
has
full
opportunity
to
present
its
case
and
the
one
clear
issue
is
decided
in
favor
of
the
defendant
in
that
case,
that
he
should
not
be
tried
again
for
the
charge
for
which
the
jury
has
obviously
found
one
positive
result.
so,
we
say
that
even
if
palko
were
the
law
today,
with
this
watered
down
requirement,
i
believe
that
this
case
still
would
come
under
the
rule
enunciated
in
palko,
but,
the
palko
case
is
no
longer
controlling
in
this
regard
because
of
the
case
of
benton
versus
maryland
in
which
justice
marshall
wrote
the
opinion
just
june
of
this
year.
and
in
that
opinion,
this
court
said
that
the
double
jeopardy
concept,
the
double
jeopardy
theory,
the
core
of
the
concept
of
double
jeopardy
applies
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment.
so,
one
cannot
read
the
benton
versus
maryland
without
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
now
this
court
has
stated
there
are
no
longer
two
rules,
one
for
state
cases
and
one
for
federal
cases.
there
is
just
one
rule
now
and
that
is
for
the
federal
rule
because
as
the
opinion
of
judge
marshall
said
that
the
basic
protection
of
double
jeopardy
is
so
thoroughly
ingrained
in
our
law
that
it
was
present
even
at
the
common
law
before
it
was
enshrined
in
the
fifth
amendment.
and,
therefore,
that
you
cannot
permit
an
individual
when
his
constitutional
rights
are
being
grossly
affected
as
i
believe
this
defendant's
were,
to
have
a
court
say,
“well,
we'll
apply
one
rule
to
that
man
on
the
double
jeopardy
question
and
another
rule
if
his
case
was
in
a
federal
court.”
i
see
that
i
have
at
five
minutes
left
and
i
would
like
to
use
the
five
minutes
after
my
colleague
has
argued.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
wish
to
make
three
points
and
i
must
touch
them
lightly
because
i
want
to
get
them
all
in
the
five
minutes
i
have
left.
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
white;
the
federal
court
for
a
long
time
has
distinguished
between
a
strict
double
jeopardy
case
and
what
we
will
call
a
double
jeopardy
situation.
the
benton
case
was
one
where
a
defendant
had
been
found
guilty
of
both
burglary
and
larceny
and
when
he
was
or
had
been
charged
with
burglary
and
larceny
and
on
trial
had
been
acquitted
of
larceny.
the
court
held
he
could
not
be
charged
or
tried
again
on
larceny
because
it
was
now
the
federal
rule
was
applying
and
it
was
double
jeopardy.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
it
did
not
in
that
instance.
now,
this
court,
the
supreme
court,
and
many
of
the
court
of
appeals,
federal
courts
of
appeals
have
met
the
question
of
what
do
you
do
in
a
double
jeopardy
situation
when
it
is
not
the
exact
charge
that
is
being
directed
against
the
defendant
for
the
second
time?
they
have
in
that
instance
resorted
to
the
accepted
rule
of
collateral
estoppel
and
they
have
said
many
times
that
when
the
facts
of
a
case
show
clearly
that
there
is
one
major
thrust
to
the
state's
evidence
and
the
defendant
has
met
that
and
has
been
acquitted
on
that
one
major
point,
then
we
are
not
going
to
make
him
run
the
gauntlet
again.
it
compares
collateral
estoppel
with
the
theory
of
res
judicata.
the
chief
justice
himself
in
the
watts
case
recognized
the
application
of
collateral
estoppel
to
a
federal
criminal
case.
justice
douglas
referred
to
it
in
the
sealfon
sugar
case
and
there
it
was
applied.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
it
was
not,
it
was
not,
but
it
was
--
on
those
particular
facts
he
said
that
this
should
apply.
justice
holmes
did
it
in
oppenheimer
case.
there
is
an
excellent
review
of
the
whole
question
of
collateral
estoppel
in
the
kramer
case
where
judge
friendly
of
the
second
circuit
analyzes
the
whole
matter
and
says
that
it
should
be
used
in
federal
cases
when
it's
appliable.
and
under
the
benton
decision,
this
case
now
must
be
looked
at
in
the
light
of
the
federal
rule
and
not
the
old
state
rule
which
has
now
become
archaic.
second
quick
point,
the
state
of
missouri,
in
the
supreme
court
of
missouri,
in
the
federal
district
court,
in
the
federal
court
of
appeals
and
here
has
cited
the
hoag
case
as
its
authority
for
forcing
this
man
to
serve
this
sentence
when
he
was
tried
on
exactly
the
same
issue.
a
quick
comment
on
the
hoag
case;
that
was
a
case
tried
in
new
jersey.
it
so
happens
that
justice
brennan
sat
in
that
case,
it
was
a
four
to
three
decision.
justice
brennan
dissented
in
that
case,
it
was
a
holdup
case
like
this
one.
that
case
came
on
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
justice
brennan
abstained
and
it
was
a
five
to
three
decision
here.
if
he
had
voted
i
assume
it
would
be
five
to
four.
so,
we
have
a
case
that's
four
to
three
in
new
jersey
and
would
have
been
five
to
four
in
this
case,
i
believe
had
he
voted.
now,
they
can
no
longer
use
the
hoag
case
i
submit
to
your
honor.
one;
the
hoag
case
has
been
repudiated
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
in
the
kermeyer
(ph)
case
and
they
specifically
referred
to
the
hoag
case
in
the
kermeyer
case
and
suggest
they're
not
going
to
follow
that
rule
any
longer.
and
the
language
of
the
kermeyer
decision
now
in
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
is
that
collateral
estoppel
should
be
ungrudgingly
applied
in
this
type
of
case.
also,
i
submit
to
you,
hoag
is
no
longer
an
authority
in
this
case
because
benton
has
changed
hoag
also.
because
hoag
comments
on
the
fact
that
there
are
two
rules,
one
rule
that
is
quite
beneficial
to
defendants
in
federal
cases
and
one
that
really
hardly
at
all
as
to
state
cases.
also,
in
the
hoag
case,
this
court
said
we're
not
going
to
go
behind
the
finding
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
and
look
into
that
record.
we
don't
want
to
do
that
to
state
courts,
that
was
under
the
old
rule.
you
can
do
it
now
because
it
is
under
the
federal
rule
and
you
have
the
right
to
look.
so,
i
say
hoag
is
no
longer
an
authority
for
the
case.
last
comment;
sometimes
when
you
go
through
a
record
of
this
kind
and
look
at
it,
it's
murky,
it's
difficult
to
find
out
really
what
happened.
occasionally,
you
come
to
a
door
and
you
open
the
door
and
let
light
right
on
in,
that
happened
in
this
case.
and,
i
refer
your
honors
to
what
happened
just
before
this
second
case
was
tried.
after
he
was
acquitted
the
first
time,
there
was
a
colloquy
between
the
trial
judge
and
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
and
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
that
that
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes
sir,
it's
107
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
its
107
your
honor
and
i
just
want
to
say
this.
if
the
judge
said
in
view
of
the
wide
publicity
that's
attended
this
case,
the
fact
that
the
co-defendants
have
been
tried
and
convicted,
so
that
by
time
this
fellow
came
to
trial
the
second
time,
he'd
had
one
trial,
the
other
three
had
been
tried
and
acquitted
with
resulting
publicity
and
yet
the
state
of
missouri
said
that
original
acquittal
meant
absolutely
nothing
to
us
or
to
this
man.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
thank
you
your
honor.
