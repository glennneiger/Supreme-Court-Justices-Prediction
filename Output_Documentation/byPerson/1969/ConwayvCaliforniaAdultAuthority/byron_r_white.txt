so?

by
a

by
one
judge?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
long
these
are
--
when
you're
denied
as
strictly
probable
cause
of
the
district
court
and
you
don't
--
you're
not
--
you
don't
go
up
on
appeal
then
but
you
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
is
there
a
time
limit
on
when
you
have
to
go
and
you
waited
years
to
ask
the
court
of
appeals
first
of

justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
appeal
--
if
the
appeal
time
applied,
you
would
be
out
of
time?
justice
byron

yes.

that
was
a
wrong
route
where
his
mistaken
to
say
he
was
going
to
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
should
have
gone
--
he
should
have
gone
to
the
court
of

justice
byron
r.
white
but
nevertheless
his
proper
procedure
was
to
ask
the
court
of
appeals
for
certificate
of
probable
cause.
justice
byron

but
the
moment
that
