mr.

your
honors,
i
might
reply
to
your
question
if
you
look
at
page
4
mr.
justice
white
will
note
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
of
the
appendix.
the
document
called
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
he
does
raised
the
issue
of
cause,
denial
for
cause.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
page
4.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
page
4
of
the
appendix.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
oh,
c,
10c
the
printed
appendix
that
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
c,
under
both
10
and
11.
it
seeks
to
raise
a
issue
of
unconstitutional
revocation
or
unconstitutional
for
lack
of
cause.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
he's
trying
to
raised
those
well
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
we
don't
contest
the
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
can
see
directly
the
record
is
very
confusing.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
--
there
are
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
alleged
the
federal
question?
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
it
alleges
of
a
violation
of
a
constitutional
right.
yes.
but
it
is
our
contention,
we
have
three
contentions.
first,
we
contend
that
this
matter
isn't
even
properly
in
this
court.
first,
because
it
was
untimely
appeal
for
the
court
of
appeals.
secondly,
as
to
the
issue
of
an
unconstitutional
cause
that
that
matter
was
not
even
properly
before
district
court
in
a
review
of
the
documents
filed
in
this
case
indicates
clearly
that
this
contention
was
never
presented
to
any
california
court.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
third
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
we
say
that
federal
--
we
say
that
was
no
improper
denial
of
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
is
our
third
point.
but
the
circuit
judge
here,
base
on
the
fact
that
the
constitutionality
of
these
statutes
in
determinant
sentence
law
has
been
determined
for
some
nearly
70
years
has
been
nearly
uniformly
upheld
this
constitutional
by
circuit
courts
and
state
courts.
that
it
is
our
contention
that
if
the
chief
judge
cannot
deny
certificate
of
probable
cause
base
on
such
a
long
life
president,
then
the
requirement
of
congress,
requiring
as
certificate
of
probable
cause
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
is
the
raised
also
the
question
that
cause
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
we
say
that
was
not
properly
before
the
district
court,
those
facts.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
allegation
was
not
properly
before
the
court
and
not
properly
before
this
court
for
two
reasons.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
this
is
a
footnote
to
a
supplement
to
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
which
is
unsworn
to.
which
it
appears
in
the
printed
record
and
appears
in
the
record
before
the
district
court.
as
pointed
out,
we
enter
the
case
for
the
first
time
on
the
petition
for
served.
we
will
never
served
with
the
documents
filed
in
the
district
court
as
noted
in
the
original
denial
of
the
petitions
by
the
district
judge
and
in
fact
have
never
received
those
documents.
however,
we
contend
that
after
this
particular
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes,
yes
i
can.
it's
a
supplement.
the
petition
for
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
has
starts
at
page
2.
it
ends
at
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes.
it
ends
a
page
7
that's
the
form
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith

mr.
arlo
e.
smith
you'll
that
is
your
affidavit
of
property,
that
is
sworn
to.
the
second
document
which
is
dated
april
27th
before
file
august
25th
for
reports
that
would
be
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
it
is
a
discussion,
as
you
can
see,
of
the
statement
of
the
case
of
the
proceedings
and
state
court
in
the
review
of
the
proceedings
in
the
federal
court.
there
is
a
footnote
to
what
is
not
clear
whether
it
be
to
the
proceedings
in
the
state
of
the
federal
courts
which
contains
these
statements
of
fact.
this
document
is
not
sworn
to
as
indicated
by
page
16.
there
is
no
statement
that
your
add
is
submitted
a
review
of
the
original
record
on
the
file
in
this
court
will
indicate,
why?
there
was
no
jury
on.
it
was
not
sworn.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
it
doesn't.
there
are
three
documents
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
what
we
say
it's
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
we
do
not.
but
i
say,
he
could
not
act
on
it
because
it
was
not
a
sworn
to
allegation
statement
of
fact.
we
cannot
accepted
this
through
in
this
court.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
what
you
mean
if
the
district
judge
had
issued
in
order
to
show
cause.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes,
we
would
have
--
the
record
have
been
developed
that's
correct.
we
would
have
served,
we
would
have
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
they
are
not
transcribed.
the
procedure
--
the
adult
authority
is
to
--
in
the
both
in
the
fixing
of
terms
and
in
the
refixing
of
terms
is
a
result
of
a
hearing
for
quotes
surround
it
with
the
inmate
involve.
after
the
correctional
counsel
and
the
adult
authority
have
reveal
the
entire
case
final
which
includes
what
is
called
a
case
summary.
which
includes
of
reports
of
the
psychological
report,
the
psychiatric
report,
the
vocational
report,
the
educational
report,
the
social
report,
and
the
custodial
report.
all
referring
to
is
adjustment
his
rehabilitation
as
training,
his
if
the
guidance
he
is
taking.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
i
think
that
there
are
two
answers
and
i
was
hoping
to
summarize
my
argument
but
let
me
summarize
that
point
of
our
argument
right
now.
first,
on
this
point
it
is
our
contention
that
due
process
does
not
required
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
that
refixing,
the
fixing
of
the
term.
any
moment
then
the
adult
authority
or
other
body
not
at
arbitrarily
in
capriciously
or
with
invidious
discrimination.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
under
the
rule
in
the
california
courts,
it
can
call
for
and
does
call
for
the
records
of
the
adult
authority
which
include
the
kind
of
document
attached
here,
disciplinary
proceedings,
and
the
case
summary,
the
correctional
officer's
case
summary.
as
our
contention
that
that
is
the
only
open
review
require
by
due
process.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no.
it
is
our
contention
first
that
that
is
not
changing
the
sentence.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
under
california
law
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
it's
only
tentative.
it's
not
fix.
it's
subject
to
being
refix.
it's
tentative
only.
it's
a
no
right.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
no
your
honor.
they
can
be
reason
to
reduced
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
if
that
allegation
is
made
in
the
court
in
california
that
his
unconstitutional
cause
was
the
basis.
in
other
words,
that
the
allegations
that
appear
here
for
the
first
time
in
the
district
court
were
made
in
the
california
courts.
the
california
court
would
inquire
into
it.
if
the
burden
would
shift
in
effect
to
the
adult
authority
to
contradict
that.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
is
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
let
me
address
myself
to
that
particular
point.
what
we
have
here
in
the
district
court
are
three
documents.
two
of
them
labeled
writs
of
that
applications
for
petitions
for
writs
of
habeas
corpus
and
another
document
which
is
labeled
the
76
paid
supplement.
now,
when
you
examine
those
documents
in
the
76
paid
supplement
purports
to
include
copies
of
documents
filed
another
court
stating
back
to
1963.
the
examination
of
those
documents,
you
will
note
that
in
none
of
it
is
there
this
allegation
concerning
to
unconstitutional
cause
made.
the
allegation
was
not
made
in
the
california
supreme
court
or
any
other
federal
or
state
court.
it
occurs
for
the
first
time
in
a
document
dated
april
27,
1967,
some
six
years
later
and
several
writs
later.
for
the
first
time
in
the
footnote,
to
supplement
to
a
petition
which
is
not
sworn
to
and
i
suggest
that
the
district
court
may
well
have
considered
the
fact
that
this
is
a
new
a
ennoble
and
improved
allegation
that
did
not
appear
before
and
indeed
was
not
sworn
to.
therefore,
it
is
our
contention
that
that
matter
was
not
before
the
district
court
properly.
it
is
not
properly
here.
we
need
not
accepted
this
true.
should
not
and
cannot
be
considered
as
true
for
purposes
of
this
proceeding.
it
shows
us
that
there
was
no
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
on
the
very
record
file
here.
it
shows
that
it
is
simply
unsworn
footnote
to
a
supplement
to
a
petition
which
the
district
court
could
not
and
should
not
of
considered
and
which
is
should
not
and
need
not
be
consider
as
a
factual
truth,
factual
allegation
in
this
court.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
devote
a
few
minutes
to
the
question
of
the
timeliness
of
this
appeal.
the
rules
of
ninth
circuit
are
quite
simple.
it
requires
as
the
federal
statutes
that
there
be
a
notice
of
appeal
within
30
days
from
the
file
order
of
the
district
court
denying
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
that
pursuant
to
the
statute
requiring
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
that
such
a
certificate
be
obtained
either
within
30
days
after
denial
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
or
30
days
after
a
denial
of
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
by
the
district
court.
these
are
four
more
liberal
rules
and
that
followed
in
after
circuits
such
as
the
first
and
others.
the
court
itself
have
the
chief
judge
granted
the
certificate
under
the
cases
we've
cited,
the
panel
would
have
examined
this
question
either
on
our
motion
or
on
its
own
motion
and
would
have
dismissed
the
case.
the
rules
are
very
liberal
there,
any
paper
that
notes
so
intent
to
appeal
will
be
deem
as
a
notice
of
the
appeal.
and
what
happen
here
was
that
the
district
judge
denied
the
petition
on
september
27th.
on
october
10th,
the
petitioner
filed
eight
application
for
a
certificate
of
probable
cause.
he
denied
--
the
district
judge
denied
that
application
on
october
31st.
however,
under
the
rules
of
the
ninth
circuit,
that
application
for
certificate
of
probable
cause
maybe
deemed
a
timely
notice
of
appeal.
but
of
course,
that
does
perfect
the
appeal,
there
must
be
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
granted
timely.
the
application
in
subsequent
denial
by
the
district
court
added
to
his
time,
30
days
from
october
31st
to
apply
for
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
as
indicated
by
the
earlier
question
the
circuit
with
the
judge
designed
of
the
circuit
of
the
supreme
court.
however,
nothing
was
done
to
the
record
reflects
until
december
14th.
when
the
clerk
received
the
document
labeled
an
affidavit
in
which
two
allegations
are
made.
one,
that
the
petitioner
had
sought
the
file
a
notice
of
appeal
in
the
district
court
on
november
17th
and
had
tendered
the
$5.00
fee
which
was
taken
from
the
trust
account
of
the
fellow
inmate
and
the
clerk
had
refused
the
file.
well,
this
is
irrelevant
because
there
is
a
good
notice
of
appeal
under
the
rules
already
filed.
he
also
asserts
that
he
attempted
the
file
in
the
circuit
court.
a
writ
of
mandate,
for
a
petition
for
writ
of
mandate,
requiring
the
warden
to
permitting
to
withdraw
$5.00
from
the
trust
account
of
the
same
fellow
inmate
for
the
purpose
of
his
filing
fee
which
is
of
course
inconsistent
with
his
earlier
statement
that
he
tendered
$5.00.
then,
he
ask
generally
for
an
extension
of
time
but
this
is
some
44
days
after
the
denial
of
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
in
the
district
court
and
some
74
days
after
or
longer
after
the
denial
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
out
time.
the
judge
did
deem
this
document
to
be
an
application
for
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
and
denied
it.
but
we
say
and
reviewed
the
panel
would
have
under
the
rules
of
that
court
have
filed
it
untimely.
such
a
rule
and
certainly
not
unreasonable,
certainly
done
in
constitutional.
there
must
time
limitations
of
policy
of
other
of
the
statute
requiring
30
days
for
a
notice
of
appeal.
certainly
contemplates
that
the
time
for
appeal
that
notice
be
given
timely
and
that
clerk,
the
court,
the
parties,
now
that
the
appeal
is
pending
and
that
the
option
for
protecting
the
appeal
are
not
be
left
with
the
petitioner.
secondly
if
facilitates
the
policy
of
congress
requiring
in
limiting
the
appeals
in
this
kinds
of
cases
by
the
virtue
of
a
fact
that
in
large
major
they
place
burden
upon
the
federal
courts
and
upon
the
states
because
as
a
plus
they
are
generally
in
their
authorities.
furthermore,
this
man
is
not
cut
off
on
any
right.
the
denial
of
their
petition
for
an
application
of
petition
for
habeas
corpus
is
not
filed,
it
always
go
back
in
front.
file,
he's
not
anything
as
you
like
news
are
right
to
pursue
a
point
in
an
appeal
from
the
criminal
conviction.
finally,
we
have
argued
that
the
--
there
was
no
abuse
of
discretion
here
by
the
circuit
court
in
the
denial
of
the
appli
--
denial
of
the
application
for
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
based
on
the
long
standing
precedents
both
of
this
court
and
of
the
circuit
courts.
we
say
that
there
was
no
substantial
federal
question
presented.
our
next
contention
is
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
petitioner
has
in
fact
received
what
he
claims
he
must
received
by
the
adult
authority.
his
term
has
been
refixed
for
a
cause
and
i
might
clarify
the
point
raised
earlier
that
this
is
not
final,
under
state
law
there
is
in
determined
of
the
sentence.
in
this
case
filed
the
life
consecutive.
its
fixed
by
statute
at
maximum.
the
adult
authority
fixed
it.
the
term
and
the
minimum
in
this
case.
they
then
refixed
it
as
they
do
in
case
of
any
violations
at
the
maximum
but
that
is
not
final.
they
normally,
usually,
in
virtually
every
case
refixed
it
again
at
less
than
maximum.
now,
in
this
case
the
petitioner,
the
record
reflects
that
there
was
cause.
he
was
in
fact
and
that
he'd
receive
notice
and
a
hearing.
he
was

in
a

his
term

he

of

in
the
fight,
fellow

he
was
given
notice
and
a
complaint
which
set
out
those
facts.
he
was
notified
there
would
be
a
hearing
before
the
disciplinary
board.
the
hearing
was
granted.
he
appeared.
he
gave
version
of
the
facts.
he
was
found
that
he
participated
in
this
fight
as
report
pursuing
to
the
rules
of
the
adult
authority
were
forwarded
to
it.
it
adopted
the
findings
of
the
prison
disciplinary
group.
it
sets
his
hearing
over
for
six
months.
at
that
hearing,
the
record
reflects
that
by
his
own
allegations
that
he
discussed
turn.
he
had
a
hearing
in
that
sense.
he
had
noticed
and
the
notice
original
note
is
filed
in
the
december
indicated
that
one
of
the
results
of
this
hearing
could
be
refixing.
so,

has
notified

writing.
he

battery?
oh,
this
is
a
miss
to
me.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
you
mean
in
this
--
well,
i
don't
know
the
facts
the
man
had
the
cut
--
cut
lip
by
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
in
assault
by
a
prisoner
of
another
prisoner
serving
a
life
term.
it's
a
very
serious.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
the
answer
of
that
is
no.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
he
did
not.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
he
got
his
term
refixed.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
at
the
maximum.
but
subject
to
being
refix.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
true
but
its
not
final,
it
tentative.
he
can
be
refix
at
any
point
and
it
is
end
that.
it
is
no
way
a
punishment
for
that
act.
it
simply
an
indication
that
he
is
not
adjusted
or
rehabilitated.
there's
not
presented
a
sufficient
risk
to
be
placed
on
the
parole
and
to
have
the
term
fixed
and
go
into
the
community.
that
is
all
that
indicates.
our
final
argument
is
that,
there
is
constitution
does
not
require
in
this
situation,
anymore
than
there
be
cause.
due
process
and
i
simply
requires
the
sixth
amendment
is
not
applicable.
these
are
not
criminal
proceedings.
there
is
then
an
argument
here
that
this
is
the
keen
to
sentencing
and
that
indeed
the
judges
is
very
limited
which
is
not
so
in
california.
as
we
indicated
in
our
brief,
only
17%
of
those
people
convicted
of
felonies
are
ever
sent
to
the
state
prison.
the
other
83%
are
given
probation,
jail,
conditions
of
probation,
sent
to
other
institutions
such
as
the
narcotic
treatment
center
or
mental
ins
--
other
mental
institutions.
the
fact
is
that
at
that
point,
the
punitive
part
of
the
criminal
process
has
ended.
the
punitive
part
of
the
prison
term
is
that
which
is
the
minimum
set
for
the
legislature.
but
he
sentence
him
to
the
state
prison,
the
minimum
represent
the
legislature
determination
that
fact
will
suffice
--
that
that
will
suffice
to
deter
a
third
persons
from
committing
these
kinds
of
acts
here
arm
robbery
and
that
will
serve
to
punish
the
individual
involve.
but
as
judge
goodrich
has
said,
once
the
period
of
contentious
litigations
is
over,
when
a
man
accused
of
crime
its
tried
in
the
sentenced.
now,
the
problem
becomes
one
of
an
attempt
that
rehabilitation.
there
is
no
place
for
the
punitive
process
once
that
minimum
term
in
state
prison
is
fixed.
as
our
contention
that
minford
versus
ray
does
not
apply
here
as
your
other
point
out
that
involve
counsel.
that
on
the
revocation
of
parole,
the
sentence
had
not
been
entered.
the
counsel
was
neither
to
marshal
the
facts
one
and
you
stated
that
even
more
important
was
the
necessity
of
counsel
to
preserve
rights
which
otherwise
would
have
been
lost
to
with
an
appeal
and
specifically,
an
appeal
and
a
right
to
withdraw
of
that
plea.
no
rights
are
lost
in
this
process.
it
can
always
be
fixed
and
refixed,
there
is
nothing
final.
secondly,
the
case
of
minford
versus
ray
did
not
overrule
the
case
of
williams
versus
new
york,
in
which
this
court
stated
it
at
that
point
at
sentencing
a
man
was
not
entitled
to
all
of
the
procedural
protections
that
were
recorded
to
the
man
during
the
criminal
trial.
specifically,
that
he
did
not
have
the
right
of
confrontation
in
cross
examination.
that
the
judge
could
rely
upon
probation
reports,
hearsay
as
to
the
man
background,
he's
social
adjustment,
his
education,
his
training,
his
jobs,
his
family,
all
of
those
factors
that
go
into
the
determination
of
sentence
along
with
the
punitive
element
in
the
sentence.
this
court
has
said
in
cases
and
indeed.
mr.
justice
black
said,
“they
have
the
due
process
clause
should
not
be
treated
as
the
device
for
freezing
the
evidential
procedure
of
sentencing
in
the
mold
of
trial
procedure.”
as
our
contention
here
that
the
kind
of
procedure
and
the
very
nature
of
the
thing
involve
as
indicated
in
numerous
cases
of
such
as
hannah
versus
larthe.
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
must
be
look
to
in
determining
what
due
process
rights
are
applicable
here.
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
and
the
burden
placed
upon
that
proceeding.
the
courts
have
indicated
that
they
use
a
lot
of
terms
that
this
is
a
privilege,
it's
a
never
of
grace,
its
not
an
adjudication.
but
i
think
that
the
court
miss
the
circuit
properly
pointed
out
that
his
characterization
does
not
answer
the
question
that
we
must
look
to
the
nature
of
what
it
is.
not
simply
characterized
as
a
privilege
or
approach
of
right
and
the
nature
of
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
the
determination
by
a
group
of
experts
who
are
concerned
with
the
rehabilitation
and
the
readjustment
of
people
committed
to
the
state
prisons.
at
the
other
hand,
they
must
look
at
the
risk
they
present
to
the
public
and
there
is
one
point
i
would
like
to
make
and
that
is
that
the
in
making
these
evaluations,
the
wider
the
latitude
they
have
in
making
it,
the
greater
possibility
before
error.
that
is
that
there
are
greater
possibility
that
they
made
a
mistake,
that
the
man
maybe
a
bad
risk.
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
more
difficult
is
it
is
for
such
groups
to
correct
that
error,
then
the
less
latitude
they
will
have
in
making
that
determination.
either
as
a
matter
of
fact
or
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
i
say,
we
do
the
prisoners
know
service
when
we
impose
upon
this
procedure,
any
burden
be
on
that
that
requires
that
agency
to
act
with
cause.
i
suggest
that
the
board
must
and
does
look
at
his
entire
background
in
the
fixing
and
refixing
of
these
terms.
thank
you.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
your
honors,
i
might
reply
to
your
question
if
you
look
at
page
4
mr.
justice
white
will
note
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
of
the
appendix.
the
document
called
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
he
does
raised
the
issue
of
cause,
denial
for
cause.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
page
4.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
page
4
of
the
appendix.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
oh,
c,
10c
the
printed
appendix
that
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
c,
under
both
10
and
11.
it
seeks
to
raise
a
issue
of
unconstitutional
revocation
or
unconstitutional
for
lack
of
cause.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
he's
trying
to
raised
those
well
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
we
don't
contest
the
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
can
see
directly
the
record
is
very
confusing.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
--
there
are
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
alleged
the
federal
question?
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
it
alleges
of
a
violation
of
a
constitutional
right.
yes.
but
it
is
our
contention,
we
have
three
contentions.
first,
we
contend
that
this
matter
isn't
even
properly
in
this
court.
first,
because
it
was
untimely
appeal
for
the
court
of
appeals.
secondly,
as
to
the
issue
of
an
unconstitutional
cause
that
that
matter
was
not
even
properly
before
district
court
in
a
review
of
the
documents
filed
in
this
case
indicates
clearly
that
this
contention
was
never
presented
to
any
california
court.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
third
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
we
say
that
federal
--
we
say
that
was
no
improper
denial
of
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
is
our
third
point.
but
the
circuit
judge
here,
base
on
the
fact
that
the
constitutionality
of
these
statutes
in
determinant
sentence
law
has
been
determined
for
some
nearly
70
years
has
been
nearly
uniformly
upheld
this
constitutional
by
circuit
courts
and
state
courts.
that
it
is
our
contention
that
if
the
chief
judge
cannot
deny
certificate
of
probable
cause
base
on
such
a
long
life
president,
then
the
requirement
of
congress,
requiring
as
certificate
of
probable
cause
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
is
the
raised
also
the
question
that
cause
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
we
say
that
was
not
properly
before
the
district
court,
those
facts.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
allegation
was
not
properly
before
the
court
and
not
properly
before
this
court
for
two
reasons.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
this
is
a
footnote
to
a
supplement
to
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
which
is
unsworn
to.
which
it
appears
in
the
printed
record
and
appears
in
the
record
before
the
district
court.
as
pointed
out,
we
enter
the
case
for
the
first
time
on
the
petition
for
served.
we
will
never
served
with
the
documents
filed
in
the
district
court
as
noted
in
the
original
denial
of
the
petitions
by
the
district
judge
and
in
fact
have
never
received
those
documents.
however,
we
contend
that
after
this
particular
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes,
yes
i
can.
it's
a
supplement.
the
petition
for
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
has
starts
at
page
2.
it
ends
at
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes.
it
ends
a
page
7
that's
the
form
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
page
7.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
you'll
that
is
your
affidavit
of
property,
that
is
sworn
to.
the
second
document
which
is
dated
april
27th
before
file
august
25th
for
reports
that
would
be
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
it
is
a
discussion,
as
you
can
see,
of
the
statement
of
the
case
of
the
proceedings
and
state
court
in
the
review
of
the
proceedings
in
the
federal
court.
there
is
a
footnote
to
what
is
not
clear
whether
it
be
to
the
proceedings
in
the
state
of
the
federal
courts
which
contains
these
statements
of
fact.
this
document
is
not
sworn
to
as
indicated
by
page
16.
there
is
no
statement
that
your
add
is
submitted
a
review
of
the
original
record
on
the
file
in
this
court
will
indicate,
why?
there
was
no
jury
on.
it
was
not
sworn.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
it
doesn't.
there
are
three
documents
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
what
we
say
it's
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
we
do
not.
but
i
say,
he
could
not
act
on
it
because
it
was
not
a
sworn
to
allegation
statement
of
fact.
we
cannot
accepted
this
through
in
this
court.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
what
you
mean
if
the
district
judge
had
issued
in
order
to
show
cause.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes,
we
would
have
--
the
record
have
been
developed
that's
correct.
we
would
have
served,
we
would
have
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
they
are
not
transcribed.
the
procedure
--
the
adult
authority
is
to
--
in
the
both
in
the
fixing
of
terms
and
in
the
refixing
of
terms
is
a
result
of
a
hearing
for
quotes
surround
it
with
the
inmate
involve.
after
the
correctional
counsel
and
the
adult
authority
have
reveal
the
entire
case
final
which
includes
what
is
called
a
case
summary.
which
includes
of
reports
of
the
psychological
report,
the
psychiatric
report,
the
vocational
report,
the
educational
report,
the
social
report,
and
the
custodial
report.
all
referring
to
is
adjustment
his
rehabilitation
as
training,
his
if
the
guidance
he
is
taking.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
i
think
that
there
are
two
answers
and
i
was
hoping
to
summarize
my
argument
but
let
me
summarize
that
point
of
our
argument
right
now.
first,
on
this
point
it
is
our
contention
that
due
process
does
not
required
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
that
refixing,
the
fixing
of
the
term.
any
moment
then
the
adult
authority
or
other
body
not
at
arbitrarily
in
capriciously
or
with
invidious
discrimination.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
under
the
rule
in
the
california
courts,
it
can
call
for
and
does
call
for
the
records
of
the
adult
authority
which
include
the
kind
of
document
attached
here,
disciplinary
proceedings,
and
the
case
summary,
the
correctional
officer's
case
summary.
as
our
contention
that
that
is
the
only
open
review
require
by
due
process.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no.
it
is
our
contention
first
that
that
is
not
changing
the
sentence.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
under
california
law
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
it's
only
tentative.
it's
not
fix.
it's
subject
to
being
refix.
it's
tentative
only.
it's
a
no
right.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
no
your
honor.
they
can
be
reason
to
reduced
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
if
that
allegation
is
made
in
the
court
in
california
that
his
unconstitutional
cause
was
the
basis.
in
other
words,
that
the
allegations
that
appear
here
for
the
first
time
in
the
district
court
were
made
in
the
california
courts.
the
california
court
would
inquire
into
it.
if
the
burden
would
shift
in
effect
to
the
adult
authority
to
contradict
that.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
is
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
let
me
address
myself
to
that
particular
point.
what
we
have
here
in
the
district
court
are
three
documents.
two
of
them
labeled
writs
of
that
applications
for
petitions
for
writs
of
habeas
corpus
and
another
document
which
is
labeled
the
76
paid
supplement.
now,
when
you
examine
those
documents
in
the
76
paid
supplement
purports
to
include
copies
of
documents
filed
another
court
stating
back
to
1963.
the
examination
of
those
documents,
you
will
note
that
in
none
of
it
is
there
this
allegation
concerning
to
unconstitutional
cause
made.
the
allegation
was
not
made
in
the
california
supreme
court
or
any
other
federal
or
state
court.
it
occurs
for
the
first
time
in
a
document
dated
april
27,
1967,
some
six
years
later
and
several
writs
later.
for
the
first
time
in
the
footnote,
to
supplement
to
a
petition
which
is
not
sworn
to
and
i
suggest
that
the
district
court
may
well
have
considered
the
fact
that
this
is
a
new
a
ennoble
and
improved
allegation
that
did
not
appear
before
and
indeed
was
not
sworn
to.
therefore,
it
is
our
contention
that
that
matter
was
not
before
the
district
court
properly.
it
is
not
properly
here.
we
need
not
accepted
this
true.
should
not
and
cannot
be
considered
as
true
for
purposes
of
this
proceeding.
it
shows
us
that
there
was
no
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
on
the
very
record
file
here.
it
shows
that
it
is
simply
unsworn
footnote
to
a
supplement
to
a
petition
which
the
district
court
could
not
and
should
not
of
considered
and
which
is
should
not
and
need
not
be
consider
as
a
factual
truth,
factual
allegation
in
this
court.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
devote
a
few
minutes
to
the
question
of
the
timeliness
of
this
appeal.
the
rules
of
ninth
circuit
are
quite
simple.
it
requires
as
the
federal
statutes
that
there
be
a
notice
of
appeal
within
30
days
from
the
file
order
of
the
district
court
denying
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
that
pursuant
to
the
statute
requiring
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
that
such
a
certificate
be
obtained
either
within
30
days
after
denial
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
or
30
days
after
a
denial
of
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
by
the
district
court.
these
are
four
more
liberal
rules
and
that
followed
in
after
circuits
such
as
the
first
and
others.
the
court
itself
have
the
chief
judge
granted
the
certificate
under
the
cases
we've
cited,
the
panel
would
have
examined
this
question
either
on
our
motion
or
on
its
own
motion
and
would
have
dismissed
the
case.
the
rules
are
very
liberal
there,
any
paper
that
notes
so
intent
to
appeal
will
be
deem
as
a
notice
of
the
appeal.
and
what
happen
here
was
that
the
district
judge
denied
the
petition
on
september
27th.
on
october
10th,
the
petitioner
filed
eight
application
for
a
certificate
of
probable
cause.
he
denied
--
the
district
judge
denied
that
application
on
october
31st.
however,
under
the
rules
of
the
ninth
circuit,
that
application
for
certificate
of
probable
cause
maybe
deemed
a
timely
notice
of
appeal.
but
of
course,
that
does
perfect
the
appeal,
there
must
be
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
granted
timely.
the
application
in
subsequent
denial
by
the
district
court
added
to
his
time,
30
days
from
october
31st
to
apply
for
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
as
indicated
by
the
earlier
question
the
circuit
with
the
judge
designed
of
the
circuit
of
the
supreme
court.
however,
nothing
was
done
to
the
record
reflects
until
december
14th.
when
the
clerk
received
the
document
labeled
an
affidavit
in
which
two
allegations
are
made.
one,
that
the
petitioner
had
sought
the
file
a
notice
of
appeal
in
the
district
court
on
november
17th
and
had
tendered
the
$5.00
fee
which
was
taken
from
the
trust
account
of
the
fellow
inmate
and
the
clerk
had
refused
the
file.
well,
this
is
irrelevant
because
there
is
a
good
notice
of
appeal
under
the
rules
already
filed.
he
also
asserts
that
he
attempted
the
file
in
the
circuit
court.
a
writ
of
mandate,
for
a
petition
for
writ
of
mandate,
requiring
the
warden
to
permitting
to
withdraw
$5.00
from
the
trust
account
of
the
same
fellow
inmate
for
the
purpose
of
his
filing
fee
which
is
of
course
inconsistent
with
his
earlier
statement
that
he
tendered
$5.00.
then,
he
ask
generally
for
an
extension
of
time
but
this
is
some
44
days
after
the
denial
of
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
in
the
district
court
and
some
74
days
after
or
longer
after
the
denial
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
out
time.
the
judge
did
deem
this
document
to
be
an
application
for
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
and
denied
it.
but
we
say
and
reviewed
the
panel
would
have
under
the
rules
of
that
court
have
filed
it
untimely.
such
a
rule
and
certainly
not
unreasonable,
certainly
done
in
constitutional.
there
must
time
limitations
of
policy
of
other
of
the
statute
requiring
30
days
for
a
notice
of
appeal.
certainly
contemplates
that
the
time
for
appeal
that
notice
be
given
timely
and
that
clerk,
the
court,
the
parties,
now
that
the
appeal
is
pending
and
that
the
option
for
protecting
the
appeal
are
not
be
left
with
the
petitioner.
secondly
if
facilitates
the
policy
of
congress
requiring
in
limiting
the
appeals
in
this
kinds
of
cases
by
the
virtue
of
a
fact
that
in
large
major
they
place
burden
upon
the
federal
courts
and
upon
the
states
because
as
a
plus
they
are
generally
in
their
authorities.
furthermore,
this
man
is
not
cut
off
on
any
right.
the
denial
of
their
petition
for
an
application
of
petition
for
habeas
corpus
is
not
filed,
it
always
go
back
in
front.
file,
he's
not
anything
as
you
like
news
are
right
to
pursue
a
point
in
an
appeal
from
the
criminal
conviction.
finally,
we
have
argued
that
the
--
there
was
no
abuse
of
discretion
here
by
the
circuit
court
in
the
denial
of
the
appli
--
denial
of
the
application
for
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
based
on
the
long
standing
precedents
both
of
this
court
and
of
the
circuit
courts.
we
say
that
there
was
no
substantial
federal
question
presented.
our
next
contention
is
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
petitioner
has
in
fact
received
what
he
claims
he
must
received
by
the
adult
authority.
his
term
has
been
refixed
for
a
cause
and
i
might
clarify
the
point
raised
earlier
that
this
is
not
final,
under
state
law
there
is
in
determined
of
the
sentence.
in
this
case
filed
the
life
consecutive.
its
fixed
by
statute
at
maximum.
the
adult
authority
fixed
it.
the
term
and
the
minimum
in
this
case.
they
then
refixed
it
as
they
do
in
case
of
any
violations
at
the
maximum
but
that
is
not
final.
they
normally,
usually,
in
virtually
every
case
refixed
it
again
at
less
than
maximum.
now,
in
this
case
the
petitioner,
the
record
reflects
that
there
was
cause.
he
was
in
fact
and
that
he'd
receive
notice
and
a
hearing.
he
was
engage
in
a
--
his
term
was
fixed
in
1959.
he
appeared
before
the
board
in
1960.
december
of
1960
engaged
in
the
fight,
fellow
inmates.
he
was
given
notice
and
a
complaint
which
set
out
those
facts.
he
was
notified
there
would
be
a
hearing
before
the
disciplinary
board.
the
hearing
was
granted.
he
appeared.
he
gave
version
of
the
facts.
he
was
found
that
he
participated
in
this
fight
as
report
pursuing
to
the
rules
of
the
adult
authority
were
forwarded
to
it.
it
adopted
the
findings
of
the
prison
disciplinary
group.
it
sets
his
hearing
over
for
six
months.
at
that
hearing,
the
record
reflects
that
by
his
own
allegations
that
he
discussed
turn.
he
had
a
hearing
in
that
sense.
he
had
noticed
and
the
notice
original
note
is
filed
in
the
december
indicated
that
one
of
the
results
of
this
hearing
could
be
refixing.
so,
he
has
notified
in
the
writing.
he
knew
in
fact.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
assault
and
battery?
oh,
this
is
a
miss
to
me.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
you
mean
in
this
--
well,
i
don't
know
the
facts
the
man
had
the
cut
--
cut
lip
by
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
in
assault
by
a
prisoner
of
another
prisoner
serving
a
life
term.
it's
a
very
serious.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
the
answer
of
that
is
no.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
he
did
not.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
he
got
his
term
refixed.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
at
the
maximum.
but
subject
to
being
refix.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
true
but
its
not
final,
it
tentative.
he
can
be
refix
at
any
point
and
it
is
end
that.
it
is
no
way
a
punishment
for
that
act.
it
simply
an
indication
that
he
is
not
adjusted
or
rehabilitated.
there's
not
presented
a
sufficient
risk
to
be
placed
on
the
parole
and
to
have
the
term
fixed
and
go
into
the
community.
that
is
all
that
indicates.
our
final
argument
is
that,
there
is
constitution
does
not
require
in
this
situation,
anymore
than
there
be
cause.
due
process
and
i
simply
requires
the
sixth
amendment
is
not
applicable.
these
are
not
criminal
proceedings.
there
is
then
an
argument
here
that
this
is
the
keen
to
sentencing
and
that
indeed
the
judges
is
very
limited
which
is
not
so
in
california.
as
we
indicated
in
our
brief,
only
17%
of
those
people
convicted
of
felonies
are
ever
sent
to
the
state
prison.
the
other
83%
are
given
probation,
jail,
conditions
of
probation,
sent
to
other
institutions
such
as
the
narcotic
treatment
center
or
mental
ins
--
other
mental
institutions.
the
fact
is
that
at
that
point,
the
punitive
part
of
the
criminal
process
has
ended.
the
punitive
part
of
the
prison
term
is
that
which
is
the
minimum
set
for
the
legislature.
but
he
sentence
him
to
the
state
prison,
the
minimum
represent
the
legislature
determination
that
fact
will
suffice
--
that
that
will
suffice
to
deter
a
third
persons
from
committing
these
kinds
of
acts
here
arm
robbery
and
that
will
serve
to
punish
the
individual
involve.
but
as
judge
goodrich
has
said,
once
the
period
of
contentious
litigations
is
over,
when
a
man
accused
of
crime
its
tried
in
the
sentenced.
now,
the
problem
becomes
one
of
an
attempt
that
rehabilitation.
there
is
no
place
for
the
punitive
process
once
that
minimum
term
in
state
prison
is
fixed.
as
our
contention
that
minford
versus
ray
does
not
apply
here
as
your
other
point
out
that
involve
counsel.
that
on
the
revocation
of
parole,
the
sentence
had
not
been
entered.
the
counsel
was
neither
to
marshal
the
facts
one
and
you
stated
that
even
more
important
was
the
necessity
of
counsel
to
preserve
rights
which
otherwise
would
have
been
lost
to
with
an
appeal
and
specifically,
an
appeal
and
a
right
to
withdraw
of
that
plea.
no
rights
are
lost
in
this
process.
it
can
always
be
fixed
and
refixed,
there
is
nothing
final.
secondly,
the
case
of
minford
versus
ray
did
not
overrule
the
case
of
williams
versus
new
york,
in
which
this
court
stated
it
at
that
point
at
sentencing
a
man
was
not
entitled
to
all
of
the
procedural
protections
that
were
recorded
to
the
man
during
the
criminal
trial.
specifically,
that
he
did
not
have
the
right
of
confrontation
in
cross
examination.
that
the
judge
could
rely
upon
probation
reports,
hearsay
as
to
the
man
background,
he's
social
adjustment,
his
education,
his
training,
his
jobs,
his
family,
all
of
those
factors
that
go
into
the
determination
of
sentence
along
with
the
punitive
element
in
the
sentence.
this
court
has
said
in
cases
and
indeed.
mr.
justice
black
said,
“they
have
the
due
process
clause
should
not
be
treated
as
the
device
for
freezing
the
evidential
procedure
of
sentencing
in
the
mold
of
trial
procedure.”
as
our
contention
here
that
the
kind
of
procedure
and
the
very
nature
of
the
thing
involve
as
indicated
in
numerous
cases
of
such
as
hannah
versus
larthe.
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
must
be
look
to
in
determining
what
due
process
rights
are
applicable
here.
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
and
the
burden
placed
upon
that
proceeding.
the
courts
have
indicated
that
they
use
a
lot
of
terms
that
this
is
a
privilege,
it's
a
never
of
grace,
its
not
an
adjudication.
but
i
think
that
the
court
miss
the
circuit
properly
pointed
out
that
his
characterization
does
not
answer
the
question
that
we
must
look
to
the
nature
of
what
it
is.
not
simply
characterized
as
a
privilege
or
approach
of
right
and
the
nature
of
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
the
determination
by
a
group
of
experts
who
are
concerned
with
the
rehabilitation
and
the
readjustment
of
people
committed
to
the
state
prisons.
at
the
other
hand,
they
must
look
at
the
risk
they
present
to
the
public
and
there
is
one
point
i
would
like
to
make
and
that
is
that
the
in
making
these
evaluations,
the
wider
the
latitude
they
have
in
making
it,
the
greater
possibility
before
error.
that
is
that
there
are
greater
possibility
that
they
made
a
mistake,
that
the
man
maybe
a
bad
risk.
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
more
difficult
is
it
is
for
such
groups
to
correct
that
error,
then
the
less
latitude
they
will
have
in
making
that
determination.
either
as
a
matter
of
fact
or
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
i
say,
we
do
the
prisoners
know
service
when
we
impose
upon
this
procedure,
any
burden
be
on
that
that
requires
that
agency
to
act
with
cause.
i
suggest
that
the
board
must
and
does
look
at
his
entire
background
in
the
fixing
and
refixing
of
these
terms.
thank
you.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
