mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
denial
by
the
chief
judge
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
the
ninth
circuit
of
an
application
for
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
to
appeal
from
the
denial
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
federal
district
court
had
denied
the
petition
on
the
merits
without
requiring
either
a
response
from
the
respondents
here
and
without
a
hearing.
it
was
denied
on
the
grounds
of
the
petition
failed
to
present
a
federal
constitutional
question
and
the
certificates
of
probable
cause
were
denied
by
both
courts
on
the
same
ground.
our
petitioner
in
this
case,
james
conway,
was
convicted
in
california
in
1952
on
two
counts
of
a
robbery
in
the
first
degree.
he
--
since
that
time
and
his
presently
incarcerated
by
the
state
of
california
under
the
provisions
of
the
california
indeterminate
sentence
law
and
it
is
this
law
and
the
petitioners
challenges
to
them
that
our
issue
in
this
case
not
only
the
law
itself
but
the
manner
in
which
it
has
been
administered
by
the
california
adult
authority
or
the
respondent
in
this
case.
petitioner
claims
on
a
numbered
basis
that
the
law
in
manner
of
which
it
is
administered
violates
of
fourteenth
amendment
guarantees
against
the
denial
of
due
process.
before
discussing
petitioner's
contentions
themselves,
i'd
like
briefly
to
describe
the
functioning
of
the
adult
authority
and
the
california
in
determining
sentencing
law
in
relation
to
the
particular
facts
of
petitioner's
case
as
he
is
alleged
in
this
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
i
stated
before
petitioner
was
convicted
in
1952
on
two
counts
of
a
robbery
in
the
first
degree.
following
his
conviction,
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
state
prison
and
in
doing
this
the
court
neither
gave
him
a
suspended
sentence
or
gave
him
probation.
parenthetically,
it
is
not
evident
at
all
from
the
record
in
this
case
on
what
basis
probation
or
suspended
sentence
was
denied.
it
might
have
been
under
the
provisions
of
section
1203
of
the
california
penal
code
that
at
that
time
the
superior
court
judge
was
prohibited
from
granting
probation.
that
section
particularly
as
it
existed
in
1952
contain
the
a
prohibition
against
probation
in
the
certain
kinds
of
cases
among
them
arm
robbery
for
a
deadly
weapon
was
used.
in
any
of
that,
since
no
probation
or
suspended
sentence
was
given,
the
judges
action
is
governed
by
california
penal
code
section
1168.
that
section,
specifically
prohibits
the
judge
from
specifying
the
term
or
duration
of
sentence
that
requires
him
to
merely
sentenced
the
defendant
to
the
term
prescribed
by
law
in
state
prison.
for
the
crime
of
robbery
in
the
first
degree,
the
law
prescribes
a
five-year
minimum
term
but
establishes
no
maximum.
section
671
of
the
penal
code
states
that
where
there
is
no
maximum
set
by
the
specific
statute
but
only
a
minimum
term
of
years,
then
punishment
shall
be
imprisonment
during
natural
life
subject
to
the
provisions
of
part
three
of
the
penal
code
and
part
three
is
that
section
which
deals
with
the
powers
in
the
duties
of
the
california
adult
authority.
specifically,
section
3020
of
the
penal
code
which
states
that
for
all
persons
sentenced
under
the
provisions
of
section
1168.
the
california
adult
authority
may
determine
and
re-determine
what
length
of
time
the
person
shall
be
imprison.
yet,
another
section
the
penal
code,
section
5077
delineates
the
two
basic
powers
of
the
adult
authority,
the
granting
of
the
revocation
of
parole
which
is
not
involve
in
this
case
and
the
fixing
of
sentences
which
is
the
issue
here.
our
petitioner
following
his
sentence
by
the
court,
following
his
imprisonment,
made
the
number
of
appearances
before
the
adult
authority.
finally,
in
1959
after
he's
been
imprisoned
for
some
seven
years,
approximately,
the
adult
authority
acted
pursuant
to
such
in
3020
and
fixed
petitioners
terms
at
two-five
years
sentences
to
be
served
consecutively.
i
just
point
out
that
the
superior
court
judge
had
specified
that
the
sentences
were
to
be
served
consecutively.
again
however,
no
term
or
whatsoever
was
that
by
the
superior
court
judge.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
you
mean
in
--
well,
under
the
statute,
it
has
the
duty
to
do
so.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
i
do
not
have
any
specific
information
as
to
--
at
what
point
this
power
is
exercised.
as
my
understanding
that
these
terms
are
in
facts
set
at
some
point
during
the
persons
stay
in
the
prison
particularly
to
deal
with
once
the
minimum
term
is
going
to
be
served
as
to
exactly
the
pattern
that
i
could
not
say.
petitioner
has
claimed
in
his
petition
for
habeas
corpus
that
he
believes
the
reason
the
adult
authority
do
not
act
before
it
did.
was
it
he
had
refused
to
confess
dealt
to
the
crimes
of
which
he
was
punished,
convicted.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
no,
this
--
i
do
not
believe
the
attorney
general
has
challenges
his
contention
about
the
initial
fixing.
the
attorney
general
has
challenged
that
the
revocation
of
that
fixing
was
based
on
his
later
refusal
but
the
petitioners
also
alleged
that
it
is
--
he
believes
that
the
adult
authority
did
not
set
his
sentenced
prior
to
1959
because
he
had
consistently
refused
every
time
he
came
up
before
the
adult
authority
to
admit
that
he
was
guilty
of
the
crimes.
it
was
only
when
he
did
in
1959
to
say,
“i'm
guilty”
that
they
then
set
the
terms
of
the
two
to
five
years
sentences
of
the
minimum.
as
to
what
the
general
practices
the
adult
authority,
this
record
is
not
reflected
and
on
myself
are
not
sure
what
the
specific
practice.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
well,
that's
the
problem
in
this
case
mr.
justice
douglas
is
that
there
isn't
--
there
is
an
essence
no
record
in
this
case.
all
there
is
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
is
because
of
the
lower
courts
statement
that
there's
no
federal
question
presented
at
all
by
this
challenge
to
the
action
in
the
adult
authority
and
the
dismissal
on
that
basis
it
did
not
require
response
in
the
attorney
general,
no
response
his
file,
there
is
no
evidence
taken.
it
was
simply
denied
on
its
face
as
basic
contention
here
is
that
at
the
least.
there
should
be
remand
to
the
lower
court
in
order
--
so
that
the
facts
can
be
develop
to
find
out,
what
in
fact
the
california
adult
authority
did
do
in
petitioners
case.
and
also
the
allegations
of
the
attorney
general
made
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
concerning
the
practices
in
terms
of
procedures
available.
the
unfortunate
thing
about
this
case,
there
is
no
record
because
of
the
attitude
of
the
lower
courts
towards
challenges
to
the
adult
authority.
they
have
simply
in
the
sense
said
that
the
adult
authority
is
insulated
from
constitutional
challenge,
so
that
state
in
set
up
this
system
and
it
can
work
on
whatever
the
way
it
works
and
of
these
issues
are
not
raisable
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
no,
your
honor.
we
feel
that
the
state
has
basically
misconstrued
the
federal
habeas
corpus
act
the
requirements.
it's
clear
from
the
record,
the
petitioner
did
file
in
the
district
court
in
an
application
for
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
within
30
days
from
the
denial
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
that
was
denied.
he
attempted
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
according
to
the
allegations
of
his
affidavit
which
he
filed
in
ninth
circuit.
the
district
court
clerk
refuse
to
take
it,
the
notice
of
appeal
presumably
because
there
is
some
certificate
of
probable
cause.
he
then
attempted
to
go
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
that
judge
chambers
treated
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
on
its
merits
and
denied
it
on
its
merits.
we
believe
that
the
correct
approach
in
their
correct
rules
was
that
taken
by
the
third
circuit
in
the
case
cited
our
reply
brief.
but
the
crucial
thing
is
that
something
showing
adequately
and
clearly
showing
an
intension
to
appeal
be
filed
within
30
days
after
being
initial
denial,
particularly
when
you
have
a
state
prisoner
acting
pro
improper.
otherwise,
the
whole
system
gets
encrusted
with
totally
artificial
high
on
time
limits
that
are
not
warned
by
the
habeas
corpus
act
toward
the
federal
rules
or
federal
statute.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor.
it's
the
same
situation
as
house
versus
mayo
for
example,
where
as
court
decided
that
the
denials
is
certificate
of
probable
cause
was
in
error
send
the
case
back
down
of
the
district
court
for
determination
on
the
merits.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
i
am
not
sure,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
cannot
say.
i
think
its
clear
though
that
--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
i
think
it's
clear
from
cases
such
as
house
versus
mayo
that
the
certiorari
does
lie
from
the
denial
of
the
certificate
of
probable
itself.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
well,
from
the
district
judge
but
then
--
then
what
has
to
be
done
as
to
go
to
the
circuit
court.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
quite
frankly,
i
have
not
looked
into
the
specific
matter.
i
believe,
however,
that
it
is
proper
to
go
on
with
the
certiorari
from
the
denial
of
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
itself,
to
the
new
application
for
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
from
the
justice.
some
of
circuit
justice
is
not
required
and
does
not
divest
this
court
of
jurisdiction
over
certiorari.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
i
believe
in
the
case
of
maxwell
versus
bishop
as
i
recall
and
one
of
prior
appearances
this
was
a
situation.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
your
honor,
the
third
circuit
has
essentially
--
i
don't
believe
set
any
particular
time
limit
on
it
and
their
particular
rule.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
if
were
the
appeal
from
the
denial
for
the
certificate
of
probable
cause.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
if
that
were
the
thirty
day
period.
however,
petitioner
did
file
as
an
application
received
certificate
of
probable
cause
which
clearly
show
his
intention
to
appeal
with
the
district
court
within
the
thirty
days
and
then
he
attempted
and
begin
his
affidavit
demonstrated
the
team
made
every
attempt.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
to
mean
appeal
to
from
the
denial
of
--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
well,
he
attempted
to
do
that.
his
affidavit
states
that
he
had
tried
to
file
the
appropriate
papers
to
show
his
intention
to
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals
within
a
time.
but
this
have
been
blocked
by
the
actions
of
the
state
prison
authority,
who'd
taking
away
his
papers.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor
and
the
judge
chambers
treated
the
affidavit
he
filed
as
that.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
there
might
be
some
--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor.
but
again
the
third
circuit
could
set
down
notes
specific
guidelines
as
to
how
long
or
lapse
their
might
be.
but
again
looking
the
facts
in
the
situation,
that
it
was
action
within
the
thirty
days
and
every
effort
was
made
by
petitioner.
who,
again,
was
sitting
in
the
prison
acting
on
his
own
to
get
things
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
time
and
it
was
block
according
to
his
affidavit
by
actions
of
the
state.
it
was
perfectly
proper
for
the
chief
judge
of
the
ninth
circuit
to
accept
that
as
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
and
denied
on
the
merits
which
is
what
he
did.
now
in
june
of
1961,
nine
months
before
petitioners
discharge
date
would
have
been
set.
the
petitioner
appeared
for
what
he
alleges
was
an
annual
parole
here.
he
was
asked
what
he
planning
to
do
in
his
release
and
he
said,
“he
wish
to
return
the
bakersfield
to
fight
his
case.”
at
this
point,
according
to
petitioner,
objections
are
raised
to
his
doing
this
and
mentioned
was
made
for
the
first
time
of
extending
his
term
to
allow
for
a
period,
longer
period
of
supervision
of
the
parole.
petitioner
declined,
he
said
he
wished
to
stay
with
his
previous
he
set
the
sentence
and
served
it
and
be
released.
then
subsequently
at
some
later
time
not
revealed
by
this
record.
the
adult
authority
revoke
the
two
to
five
year
terms
would
be
effective
re-sentencing
petitioner
to
two
consecutive
life
term.
our
petitioner
contends
in
this
factual
context,
it
is
rights
to
do
process
as
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
have
been
violated
in
a
number
of
respects.
first,
he
urges
that
the
california
adult
authority
hasn't
giving
a
broad
and
sweeping
power
to
sentence
and
re-sentence
on
circumstance
destroyed
by
any
standards
or
controls
or
specific
procedures
that
is
it
has
an
arbitrary
power
which
he
claims
it
is
in
fact
exercised
in
petitioners
case.
by
revoking
its
prior
determination
in
essence
re-sentencing
petitioner
for
an
invalid
reason.
from
this
argument,
our
petitioner
urges
that
the
lack
of
either
standards
or
constitutional
inadequate
procedures,
permits
the
adult
authority
to
revoke
and
refix
for
invalid
reason.
and
essentially
prohibits
the
petitioner
from
effectively
influencing
and
bringing
the
bare
on
the
determinations
the
adult
authority.
those
considerations
which
probably
go
into
a
fixing
of
the
sentenced.
petitioner
in
this
second
major
argument
urges
after
refixing
in
the
sentence
once
said
and
began
to
be
served
violated
petitioners
rights
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
as
it
applies
to
the
states
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
returning
the
point
one
petitioner,
he
contends
of
these
cases
govern
in
its
essentials
by
this
court's
decision
in
numbered
decisions
and
in
a
number
of
cases
including
towns
versus
burke,
nympha
versus
ray,
and
north
carolina
versus
pearce
which
is
decided
the
last
term
of
this
court.
these
cases
and
others
established
beyond
the
question
the
requirements
of
the
due
process
clause
do
apply
to
the
sentencing
function.
and
what
the
state
of
california
has
done
in
this
case
is
to
transfer
a
substantial
and
significant
portion
of
that
sentencing
function
from
the
judge
to
an
administrative
agency
the
california
adult
authority.
but
its
doing
so,
it
does
not
therefore
divest
that
function
of
these
constitutional
protection.
in
these
protections
as
set
out
in
the
cases
that
i've
mentioned
involve
the
number
of
things.
nympha
for
instance,
involve
the
statutory
scheme
quite
similar
to
california.
where
the
judge
is
required
to
sentenced
for
the
maximum
terms
for
the
actual
fixing
of
the
sentenced
was
done
by
a
board.
the
court
there,
although,
it
recognized
that
the
sentencing
judges
functions
had
been
circumscribe.
said
nevertheless
is
basic
constitutional
protection,
must
apply
to
even
what
the
judge
did
which
was
simply
to
gather
information
to
pass
on
the
board
which
would
make
its
eventual
determination.
it
would
seem
to
follow
necessarily
that
these
same
protections
wouldn't
hear
through
the
board
itself
when
it
makes
the
determination
it
does.
and
among
these
protections,
in
addition
to
this
involve
directly
in
nympha
is
that
of
not
increasing
or
even
originally
setting
a
sentence
for
an
improper
reason.
and
petitioner
has
contented
and
seeks
to
show
that
there
was
in
fact
an
improper
reason
for
the
adult
authorities
action
in
his
case.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
that
to
an
essence
revoke
a
previous
he
set
sentence
and
put
a
prisoner
back
on
like
term
merely
because
he
wishes
to
prove
his
innocence
once
he
gets
out.
it
applies
in
the
face
of
the
rules
and
decisions
of
this
court
and
again
for
instance,
the
pearce
case,
where
an
analogous
situation.
this
court
made
it
clear
that
the
state
could
not
imposed
condition
such
as
increase
of
the
sentence
on
a
petitioners
trying
to
fight
his
case
in
another
means
through
appeal
or
habeas
corpus.
it
might
be
noted
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
indication
of
the
adult
authority
was
it
meant
when
it
did
not
want
petitioner
to
fight
his
case.
if
the
action
of
the
adult
authority
can
stand,
it
could
very
well
set
up
and
enforce
a
rule
that
a
person
who
did
not
admit
guilt
and
completely
subject
himself
to
the
adult
authority
even
to
the
extent
of
giving
out
any
rights
to
legal
process
would
not
be
let
out
or
they
term
was
set
would
be
revoke
and
increase.
further,
petitioner
contends
that
because
the
state
of
california
has
granted
the
kind
of
arbitrary
power
it
has
to
the
adult
authority,
that
its
action
must
be
circumscribe
by
adequate
procedures.
so
that
the
reasons
and
basis
for
its
actions
appear.
and
so
that
again,
the
petitioner
can
adequately
bring
to
bear
whatever
considerations
he
fills
are
necessary
for
the
adult
authorities'
decision.
these
procedures,
again
on
the
basis
of
this
record,
do
not
exist
certainly
nothing
like
the
procedures
of
protections
and
here
in
when
a
judge
in
a
court
trial
sentences
and
determines
of
sentences
are
here.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor.
flexibility
is
one
thing
but
arbitrariness
is
another
in
order
the
flexibility
can
be
preserved
in
such
a
system
with
sufficient
protection,
so
that
the
sentencing
board
does
not
just
anything
it
feels
like
doing
it
is
involved.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
this
is
the
second
part
of
the
argument
which
is
an
independent
from
the
first
part
and
that
very
briefly
and
then
--
unless
there
are
any
questions.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
my
time
for
rebuttal.
is
that
a
line
of
cases?
a
long
line
of
cases
in
this
court
and
in
virtually
every
circuit
court
has
held
at
once
a
sentence
has
been
set
and
fixed
and
begun
to
served
it
cannot
then
be
reset.
except
appears
allows
an
exception
where
the
reason
of
sentence
no
longer
exist
is
because
in
the
appeal
has
been
taken
in
one.
then
under
certain
circumscribe
situation
a
longer
sentence
maybe
set
but
this
is
not
this
case.
in
this
case,
there
has
been
no
appeal.
the
sentence
have
not
been
set
aside.
it
is
the
same
sentence
and
the
petitioner
contends
that
double
jeopardy
clause
prohibits
the
resetting
of
it
to
higher
amount
after
it
is
been
fixed.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
a
footnote
on
page
14
and
again
it
was
not
parole
revocation.
pages
14
or
15
where
it
set
out
the
colloquy
between
petitioner
and
the
adult
authority.
and
petitioners
says
that
when
he
appeared
before
the
adult
authority,
he
was
asked
where
he
go
if
released
on
discharged
and
petitioner
replied
a
bakersfield.
and
then
subsequently,
they
began
discussing
about
why
about
increasing
a
parole
and
the
bottom
of
the
paragraph
it
says,
“and
obviously,
the
only
reason
for
this
action
was
of
course
the
petitioner
to
plead
guilty
and
not
challenges
conviction
after
being
released
on
this
charge.”
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
and
also
the
double
jeopardy
--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
--
issue
was
raised.
yes,
that
is
vague
and
uncertain
to
the
extent
to
that
it
grants
the
adult
authority.
the
ability
to
act
and
this
is
in
top
of
page
16
of
their
own
will
caprice.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
well,
yes
your
honor
but
i
think
it
was
can
be
reasonably
construed
to
include
the
issues
of
when
the
grant
of
this
time
has
been
giving
that
allows
the
adult
authority
to
act
again
freely
and
had
its
own
will
in
caprice.
with
this
requires
certain
times
of
the
constitutional
protections
to
have
some
assurance
that
this
will
not
in
fact
happen.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
i
--
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
make
two
very
quick
points.
number
one,
the
issue
has
been
raised
concerning
whether
there
is
an
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
in
this
case.
the
lower
court
did
not
dismiss
this
petition
on
the
basis
of
exhaustion.
number
two,
there
are
allegation
in
the
second
habeas
petition
on
page
11
as
to
what
was
raised
in
the
supreme
court
of
california
and
his
allegations
are
brief
warden
says
in
the
adult
authority
took
advantage
of
its
loose
definition
to
coerce
petitioner
making
weaken
submissive.
what
else
may
have
been
in
this
habeas
petition
is
not
set
out
here.
it
is
part
of
the
record,
it
was
part
of
the
record
in
the
lower
court.
again,
this
issue
of
exhaustion
whether
these
issues
are
properly
raised
before
the
state
courts
is
a
matter
that
could
be
best
be
resolved
by
the
district
court
on
remand.
this
is
again
the
problem
in
this
case
for
the
dismissal
without
asking
for
response,
without
having
a
hearing,
without
exploring
the
record
to
find
out
what
in
fact
has
happened
in
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor.
they
just
said,
no
federal
question
was
raised.
so,
with
that
disposition,
they
wouldn't
even
consider.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
denial
by
the
chief
judge
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
the
ninth
circuit
of
an
application
for
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
to
appeal
from
the
denial
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
federal
district
court
had
denied
the
petition
on
the
merits
without
requiring
either
a
response
from
the
respondents
here
and
without
a
hearing.
it
was
denied
on
the
grounds
of
the
petition
failed
to
present
a
federal
constitutional
question
and
the
certificates
of
probable
cause
were
denied
by
both
courts
on
the
same
ground.
our
petitioner
in
this
case,
james
conway,
was
convicted
in
california
in
1952
on
two
counts
of
a
robbery
in
the
first
degree.
he
--
since
that
time
and
his
presently
incarcerated
by
the
state
of
california
under
the
provisions
of
the
california
indeterminate
sentence
law
and
it
is
this
law
and
the
petitioners
challenges
to
them
that
our
issue
in
this
case
not
only
the
law
itself
but
the
manner
in
which
it
has
been
administered
by
the
california
adult
authority
or
the
respondent
in
this
case.
petitioner
claims
on
a
numbered
basis
that
the
law
in
manner
of
which
it
is
administered
violates
of
fourteenth
amendment
guarantees
against
the
denial
of
due
process.
before
discussing
petitioner's
contentions
themselves,
i'd
like
briefly
to
describe
the
functioning
of
the
adult
authority
and
the
california
in
determining
sentencing
law
in
relation
to
the
particular
facts
of
petitioner's
case
as
he
is
alleged
in
this
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
i
stated
before
petitioner
was
convicted
in
1952
on
two
counts
of
a
robbery
in
the
first
degree.
following
his
conviction,
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
state
prison
and
in
doing
this
the
court
neither
gave
him
a
suspended
sentence
or
gave
him
probation.
parenthetically,
it
is
not
evident
at
all
from
the
record
in
this
case
on
what
basis
probation
or
suspended
sentence
was
denied.
it
might
have
been
under
the
provisions
of
section
1203
of
the
california
penal
code
that
at
that
time
the
superior
court
judge
was
prohibited
from
granting
probation.
that
section
particularly
as
it
existed
in
1952
contain
the
a
prohibition
against
probation
in
the
certain
kinds
of
cases
among
them
arm
robbery
for
a
deadly
weapon
was
used.
in
any
of
that,
since
no
probation
or
suspended
sentence
was
given,
the
judges
action
is
governed
by
california
penal
code
section
1168.
that
section,
specifically
prohibits
the
judge
from
specifying
the
term
or
duration
of
sentence
that
requires
him
to
merely
sentenced
the
defendant
to
the
term
prescribed
by
law
in
state
prison.
for
the
crime
of
robbery
in
the
first
degree,
the
law
prescribes
a
five-year
minimum
term
but
establishes
no
maximum.
section
671
of
the
penal
code
states
that
where
there
is
no
maximum
set
by
the
specific
statute
but
only
a
minimum
term
of
years,
then
punishment
shall
be
imprisonment
during
natural
life
subject
to
the
provisions
of
part
three
of
the
penal
code
and
part
three
is
that
section
which
deals
with
the
powers
in
the
duties
of
the
california
adult
authority.
specifically,
section
3020
of
the
penal
code
which
states
that
for
all
persons
sentenced
under
the
provisions
of
section
1168.
the
california
adult
authority
may
determine
and
re-determine
what
length
of
time
the
person
shall
be
imprison.
yet,
another
section
the
penal
code,
section
5077
delineates
the
two
basic
powers
of
the
adult
authority,
the
granting
of
the
revocation
of
parole
which
is
not
involve
in
this
case
and
the
fixing
of
sentences
which
is
the
issue
here.
our
petitioner
following
his
sentence
by
the
court,
following
his
imprisonment,
made
the
number
of
appearances
before
the
adult
authority.
finally,
in
1959
after
he's
been
imprisoned
for
some
seven
years,
approximately,
the
adult
authority
acted
pursuant
to
such
in
3020
and
fixed
petitioners
terms
at
two-five
years
sentences
to
be
served
consecutively.
i
just
point
out
that
the
superior
court
judge
had
specified
that
the
sentences
were
to
be
served
consecutively.
again
however,
no
term
or
whatsoever
was
that
by
the
superior
court
judge.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
you
mean
in
--
well,
under
the
statute,
it
has
the
duty
to
do
so.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
i
do
not
have
any
specific
information
as
to
--
at
what
point
this
power
is
exercised.
as
my
understanding
that
these
terms
are
in
facts
set
at
some
point
during
the
persons
stay
in
the
prison
particularly
to
deal
with
once
the
minimum
term
is
going
to
be
served
as
to
exactly
the
pattern
that
i
could
not
say.
petitioner
has
claimed
in
his
petition
for
habeas
corpus
that
he
believes
the
reason
the
adult
authority
do
not
act
before
it
did.
was
it
he
had
refused
to
confess
dealt
to
the
crimes
of
which
he
was
punished,
convicted.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
no,
this
--
i
do
not
believe
the
attorney
general
has
challenges
his
contention
about
the
initial
fixing.
the
attorney
general
has
challenged
that
the
revocation
of
that
fixing
was
based
on
his
later
refusal
but
the
petitioners
also
alleged
that
it
is
--
he
believes
that
the
adult
authority
did
not
set
his
sentenced
prior
to
1959
because
he
had
consistently
refused
every
time
he
came
up
before
the
adult
authority
to
admit
that
he
was
guilty
of
the
crimes.
it
was
only
when
he
did
in
1959
to
say,
“i'm
guilty”
that
they
then
set
the
terms
of
the
two
to
five
years
sentences
of
the
minimum.
as
to
what
the
general
practices
the
adult
authority,
this
record
is
not
reflected
and
on
myself
are
not
sure
what
the
specific
practice.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
well,
that's
the
problem
in
this
case
mr.
justice
douglas
is
that
there
isn't
--
there
is
an
essence
no
record
in
this
case.
all
there
is
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
is
because
of
the
lower
courts
statement
that
there's
no
federal
question
presented
at
all
by
this
challenge
to
the
action
in
the
adult
authority
and
the
dismissal
on
that
basis
it
did
not
require
response
in
the
attorney
general,
no
response
his
file,
there
is
no
evidence
taken.
it
was
simply
denied
on
its
face
as
basic
contention
here
is
that
at
the
least.
there
should
be
remand
to
the
lower
court
in
order
--
so
that
the
facts
can
be
develop
to
find
out,
what
in
fact
the
california
adult
authority
did
do
in
petitioners
case.
and
also
the
allegations
of
the
attorney
general
made
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
concerning
the
practices
in
terms
of
procedures
available.
the
unfortunate
thing
about
this
case,
there
is
no
record
because
of
the
attitude
of
the
lower
courts
towards
challenges
to
the
adult
authority.
they
have
simply
in
the
sense
said
that
the
adult
authority
is
insulated
from
constitutional
challenge,
so
that
state
in
set
up
this
system
and
it
can
work
on
whatever
the
way
it
works
and
of
these
issues
are
not
raisable
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
no,
your
honor.
we
feel
that
the
state
has
basically
misconstrued
the
federal
habeas
corpus
act
the
requirements.
it's
clear
from
the
record,
the
petitioner
did
file
in
the
district
court
in
an
application
for
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
within
30
days
from
the
denial
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
that
was
denied.
he
attempted
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
according
to
the
allegations
of
his
affidavit
which
he
filed
in
ninth
circuit.
the
district
court
clerk
refuse
to
take
it,
the
notice
of
appeal
presumably
because
there
is
some
certificate
of
probable
cause.
he
then
attempted
to
go
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
that
judge
chambers
treated
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
on
its
merits
and
denied
it
on
its
merits.
we
believe
that
the
correct
approach
in
their
correct
rules
was
that
taken
by
the
third
circuit
in
the
case
cited
our
reply
brief.
but
the
crucial
thing
is
that
something
showing
adequately
and
clearly
showing
an
intension
to
appeal
be
filed
within
30
days
after
being
initial
denial,
particularly
when
you
have
a
state
prisoner
acting
pro
improper.
otherwise,
the
whole
system
gets
encrusted
with
totally
artificial
high
on
time
limits
that
are
not
warned
by
the
habeas
corpus
act
toward
the
federal
rules
or
federal
statute.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor.
it's
the
same
situation
as
house
versus
mayo
for
example,
where
as
court
decided
that
the
denials
is
certificate
of
probable
cause
was
in
error
send
the
case
back
down
of
the
district
court
for
determination
on
the
merits.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
i
am
not
sure,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
cannot
say.
i
think
its
clear
though
that
--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
i
think
it's
clear
from
cases
such
as
house
versus
mayo
that
the
certiorari
does
lie
from
the
denial
of
the
certificate
of
probable
itself.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
well,
from
the
district
judge
but
then
--
then
what
has
to
be
done
as
to
go
to
the
circuit
court.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
quite
frankly,
i
have
not
looked
into
the
specific
matter.
i
believe,
however,
that
it
is
proper
to
go
on
with
the
certiorari
from
the
denial
of
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
itself,
to
the
new
application
for
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
from
the
justice.
some
of
circuit
justice
is
not
required
and
does
not
divest
this
court
of
jurisdiction
over
certiorari.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
i
believe
in
the
case
of
maxwell
versus
bishop
as
i
recall
and
one
of
prior
appearances
this
was
a
situation.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
your
honor,
the
third
circuit
has
essentially
--
i
don't
believe
set
any
particular
time
limit
on
it
and
their
particular
rule.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
if
were
the
appeal
from
the
denial
for
the
certificate
of
probable
cause.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
if
that
were
the
thirty
day
period.
however,
petitioner
did
file
as
an
application
received
certificate
of
probable
cause
which
clearly
show
his
intention
to
appeal
with
the

to

mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
well,
he
attempted
to
do
that.
his
affidavit
states
that
he
had

to

the
appropriate
papers
to
show
his
intention
to
appeal
in

but
this
have
been

by

who'd
taking
away
his

mr.
charles

yes,
your
honor

the
judge

treated
the
affidavit

mr.

might

mr.

yes,

mr.
charles
stephen

but
again
the
third
circuit
could
set
down
notes
specific
guidelines
as
to
how
long
or
lapse
their
might
be.
but
again
looking
the
facts
in
the
situation,
that
it
was
action
within
the
thirty
days
and
every
effort
was
made
by
petitioner.
who,
again,
was
sitting
in
the
prison
acting
on
his
own
to
get
things
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
time
and
it
was
block
according
to
his
affidavit
by
actions
of
the
state.
it
was
perfectly
proper
for
the
chief
judge
of
the
ninth
circuit
to
accept
that
as
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
and
denied
on
the
merits
which
is
what
he
did.
now
in
june
of
1961,
nine
months
before
petitioners
discharge
date
would
have
been
set.
the
petitioner
appeared
for
what
he
alleges
was
an
annual
parole
here.
he
was
asked
what
he
planning
to
do
in
his
release
and
he
said,
“he
wish
to
return
the
bakersfield
to
fight
his
case.”
at
this
point,
according
to
petitioner,
objections
are
raised
to
his
doing
this
and
mentioned
was
made
for
the
first
time
of
extending
his
term
to
allow
for
a
period,
longer
period
of
supervision
of
the
parole.
petitioner
declined,
he
said
he
wished
to
stay
with
his
previous
he
set
the
sentence
and
served
it
and
be
released.
then
subsequently
at
some
later
time
not
revealed
by
this
record.
the
adult
authority
revoke
the
two
to
five
year
terms
would
be
effective
re-sentencing
petitioner
to
two
consecutive
life
term.
our
petitioner
contends
in
this
factual
context,
it
is
rights
to
do
process
as
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
have
been
violated
in
a
number
of
respects.
first,
he
urges
that
the
california
adult
authority
hasn't
giving
a
broad
and
sweeping
power
to
sentence
and
re-sentence
on
circumstance
destroyed
by
any
standards
or
controls
or
specific
procedures
that
is
it
has
an
arbitrary
power
which
he
claims
it
is
in
fact
exercised
in
petitioners
case.
by
revoking
its
prior
determination
in
essence
re-sentencing
petitioner
for
an
invalid
reason.
from
this
argument,
our
petitioner
urges
that
the
lack
of
either
standards
or
constitutional
inadequate
procedures,
permits
the
adult
authority
to
revoke
and
refix
for
invalid
reason.
and
essentially
prohibits
the
petitioner
from
effectively
influencing
and
bringing
the
bare
on
the
determinations
the
adult
authority.
those
considerations
which
probably
go
into
a
fixing
of
the
sentenced.
petitioner
in
this
second
major
argument
urges
after
refixing
in
the
sentence
once
said
and
began
to
be
served
violated
petitioners
rights
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
as
it
applies
to
the
states
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
returning
the
point
one
petitioner,
he
contends
of
these
cases
govern
in
its
essentials
by
this
court's
decision
in
numbered
decisions
and
in
a
number
of
cases
including
towns
versus
burke,
nympha
versus
ray,
and
north
carolina
versus
pearce
which
is
decided
the
last
term
of
this
court.
these
cases
and
others
established
beyond
the
question
the
requirements
of
the
due
process
clause
do
apply
to
the
sentencing
function.
and
what
the
state
of
california
has
done
in
this
case
is
to
transfer
a
substantial
and
significant
portion
of
that
sentencing
function
from
the
judge
to
an
administrative
agency
the
california
adult
authority.
but
its
doing
so,
it
does
not
therefore
divest
that
function
of
these
constitutional
protection.
in
these
protections
as
set
out
in
the
cases
that
i've
mentioned
involve
the
number
of
things.
nympha
for
instance,
involve
the
statutory
scheme
quite
similar
to
california.
where
the
judge
is
required
to
sentenced
for
the
maximum
terms
for
the
actual
fixing
of
the
sentenced
was
done
by
a
board.
the
court
there,
although,
it
recognized
that
the
sentencing
judges
functions
had
been
circumscribe.
said
nevertheless
is
basic
constitutional
protection,
must
apply
to
even
what
the
judge
did
which
was
simply
to
gather
information
to
pass
on
the
board
which
would
make
its
eventual
determination.
it
would
seem
to
follow
necessarily
that
these
same
protections
wouldn't
hear
through
the
board
itself
when
it
makes
the
determination
it
does.
and
among
these
protections,
in
addition
to
this
involve
directly
in
nympha
is
that
of
not
increasing
or
even
originally
setting
a
sentence
for
an
improper
reason.
and
petitioner
has
contented
and
seeks
to
show
that
there
was
in
fact
an
improper
reason
for
the
adult
authorities
action
in
his
case.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
that
to
an
essence
revoke
a
previous
he
set
sentence
and
put
a
prisoner
back
on
like
term
merely
because
he
wishes
to
prove
his
innocence
once
he
gets
out.
it
applies
in
the
face
of
the
rules
and
decisions
of
this
court
and
again
for
instance,
the
pearce
case,
where
an
analogous
situation.
this
court
made
it
clear
that
the
state
could
not
imposed
condition
such
as
increase
of
the
sentence
on
a
petitioners
trying
to
fight
his
case
in
another
means
through
appeal
or
habeas
corpus.
it
might
be
noted
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
indication
of
the
adult
authority
was
it
meant
when
it
did
not
want
petitioner
to
fight
his
case.
if
the
action
of
the
adult
authority
can
stand,
it
could
very
well
set
up
and
enforce
a
rule
that
a
person
who
did
not
admit
guilt
and
completely
subject
himself
to
the
adult
authority
even
to
the
extent
of
giving
out
any
rights
to
legal
process
would
not
be
let
out
or
they
term
was
set
would
be
revoke
and
increase.
further,
petitioner
contends
that
because
the
state
of
california
has
granted
the
kind
of
arbitrary
power
it
has
to
the
adult
authority,
that
its
action
must
be
circumscribe
by
adequate
procedures.
so
that
the
reasons
and
basis
for
its
actions
appear.
and
so
that
again,
the
petitioner
can
adequately
bring
to
bear
whatever
considerations
he
fills
are
necessary
for
the
adult
authorities'
decision.
these
procedures,
again
on
the
basis
of
this
record,
do
not
exist
certainly
nothing
like
the
procedures
of
protections
and
here
in
when
a
judge
in
a
court
trial
sentences
and
determines
of
sentences
are
here.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor.
flexibility
is
one
thing
but
arbitrariness
is
another
in
order
the
flexibility
can
be
preserved
in
such
a
system
with
sufficient
protection,
so
that
the
sentencing
board
does
not
just
anything
it
feels
like
doing
it
is
involved.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
this
is
the
second
part
of
the
argument
which
is
an
independent
from
the
first
part
and
that
very
briefly
and
then
--
unless
there
are
any
questions.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
my
time
for
rebuttal.
is
that
a
line
of
cases?
a
long
line
of
cases
in
this
court
and
in
virtually
every
circuit
court
has
held
at
once
a
sentence
has
been
set
and
fixed
and
begun
to
served
it
cannot
then
be
reset.
except
appears
allows
an
exception
where
the
reason
of
sentence
no
longer
exist
is
because
in
the
appeal
has
been
taken
in
one.
then
under
certain
circumscribe
situation
a
longer
sentence
maybe
set
but
this
is
not
this
case.
in
this
case,
there
has
been
no
appeal.
the
sentence
have
not
been
set
aside.
it
is
the
same
sentence
and
the
petitioner
contends
that
double
jeopardy
clause
prohibits
the
resetting
of
it
to
higher
amount
after
it
is
been
fixed.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
a
footnote
on
page
14
and
again
it
was
not
parole
revocation.
pages
14
or
15
where
it
set
out
the
colloquy
between
petitioner
and
the
adult
authority.
and
petitioners
says
that
when
he
appeared
before
the
adult
authority,
he
was
asked
where
he
go
if
released
on
discharged
and
petitioner
replied
a
bakersfield.
and
then
subsequently,
they
began
discussing
about
why
about
increasing
a
parole
and
the
bottom
of
the
paragraph
it
says,
“and
obviously,
the
only
reason
for
this
action
was
of
course
the
petitioner
to
plead
guilty
and
not
challenges
conviction
after
being
released
on
this
charge.”
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
and
also
the
double
jeopardy
--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
--
issue
was
raised.
yes,
that
is
vague
and
uncertain
to
the
extent
to
that
it
grants
the
adult
authority.
the
ability
to
act
and
this
is
in
top
of
page
16
of
their
own
will
caprice.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
well,
yes
your
honor
but
i
think
it
was
can
be
reasonably
construed
to
include
the
issues
of
when
the
grant
of
this
time
has
been
giving
that
allows
the
adult
authority
to
act
again
freely
and
had
its
own
will
in
caprice.
with
this
requires
certain
times
of
the
constitutional
protections
to
have
some
assurance
that
this
will
not
in
fact
happen.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
i
--
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
make
two
very
quick
points.
number
one,
the
issue
has
been
raised
concerning
whether
there
is
an
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
in
this
case.
the
lower
court
did
not
dismiss
this
petition
on
the
basis
of
exhaustion.
number
two,
there
are
allegation
in
the
second
habeas
petition
on
page
11
as
to
what
was
raised
in
the
supreme
court
of
california
and
his
allegations
are
brief
warden
says
in
the
adult
authority
took
advantage
of
its
loose
definition
to
coerce
petitioner
making
weaken
submissive.
what
else
may
have
been
in
this
habeas
petition
is
not
set
out
here.
it
is
part
of
the
record,
it
was
part
of
the
record
in
the
lower
court.
again,
this
issue
of
exhaustion
whether
these
issues
are
properly
raised
before
the
state
courts
is
a
matter
that
could
be
best
be
resolved
by
the
district
court
on
remand.
this
is
again
the
problem
in
this
case
for
the
dismissal
without
asking
for
response,
without
having
a
hearing,
without
exploring
the
record
to
find
out
what
in
fact
has
happened
in
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor.
they
just
said,
no
federal
question
was
raised.
so,
with
that
disposition,
they
wouldn't
even
consider.
