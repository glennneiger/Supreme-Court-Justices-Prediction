mr.
david
w.
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
only
matter
had
been
discussed
so
far
and
that
is
the
question
of
preliminary
hearing
in
alabama.
i
would
like
to
take
issue
with
my
opponent
on
that.
the
preliminary
hearing
in
alabama
is
one
of
these
things
in
which
an
accused
may
ask
for
a
preliminary
hearing.
now,
when
there
is
preliminary
hearing,
the
magistrate
looks
into
the
matter.
first,
at
the
time
whenever
an
offense
has
been
committed
and
then
if
the
probable
cause
that
the
person
there
committed
the
offense.
and
then,
if
that
be
so,
it
is
such
a
matter,
which
is
subject
to
bail.
now,
in
the
largest
cities,
right
they
are
in
a
place
that
preliminary
is
used
in
alabama.
and
the
reason
for
that
is,
these
accused
want
to
get
out
on
bail,
that's
their
avenue
to
get
bail
in
alabama,
is
what
it
amounts
to.
mr.
david
w.
clark
oh,
if
they
wanted
and
they
can
request.
that's
what
it
said,
they
may
request
a
preliminary
in
any
thought
of
the
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
he
did
ask
for
preliminary.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
think
that
is
correct
sir.
he
asked
for
a
preliminary
hearing
and
it
was
had
on
october
14,
1966.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
think
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
you
may,
you
could
file
a
--
and
get
that
and
they
would
say
they
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
it
could
be
said
by
the
judge
or
the
clerk
of
the
court
sometime
in
the
small
amount
of
misdemeanors
and
so
forth,
but
if
a
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
a
serious
offense.
mr.
david
w.
clark
is
to
get
bail
in
a
more
serious
offense.
this
one
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
to
get
--
that's
the
only
way
they
can
get
it
in
a
most
--
the
law
said
to
that
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
it
sets
out
the
title
15,
section
138
and
139-40,
i
think
sets
out
the
ways
of
having
a
preliminary
hearing
to
set
bail.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
if
it's
a
bailable
offense.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
in
very
minor
misdemeanor
cases.
mr.
david
w.
clark
if
the
accused
does
not
asked
for
a
preliminary
hearing,
your
honor,
then,
when
the
grand
jury
meets,
the
matter
maybe
presented
to
the
grand
jury,
and
indictment
returned,
and
then
of
course,
you
have
the
arraignment
entry.
mr.
david
w.
clark
in
effect,
yes
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
right.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir,
he
did.
usually,
at
least
going
on
that
when
they
ask
indictment
return,
the
judge
sets
bail
on
that.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
the
time
of
the
arraignment,
they
register
a
trial
then.
the
arraignment
sir
is
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
not
that
quickly,
but
at
that
time
of
the
arraignment,
they
could
of
course,
and
oppose
any
pleas
they
want
to
put
in
there
in
that
time.
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
if
thats
the
--
if
mr.
tarter
pointed
out,
if
there
has
been
on
offense
committee,
if
this
particular
person
accused
is
the
one
who
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
oh,
yes.
i
was
about
to
point
out
that
was
one
of
the
things.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
is
a
matter
as
mr.
tarter
has
pointed
out
that
is
required
in
the
code
and
there
is
a
provision
that
is
not
done,
the
magistrate
could
be
fine.
now,
that
is
sometimes
done
and
sometimes
it
isn't.
i
mean
as
far
as
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
no
i
--
as
a
recording
of
the
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
think
it
is
just
as
mr.
tarter
has
pointed
out
that
defense
attorneys
have
it
done.
i
do
have
a
case
from
birmingham
area
now,
i
believe
at
2917,
the
next
city,
in
which
a
preliminary
was
had
and
it
was
recorded
and
they
used
that
sometimes
to
as
mr.
tarter
pointed
out
to
impeach
a
witness.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no.
mr.
david
w.
clark
in
defense
in
that
case.
now,--
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
don't
know
this
one
matches.
that
is
--
at
that
time,
i
think
mr.
tarter
said
he
was
court
appointed,
so
i
assumed
the
man
did
not
have
money
to
pay
for
it.
now,
one
of
the
contentions
of
mr.
tarter
of
those
17
contentions,
he
points
out
in
his
brief
the
reason
you
should
have
an
attorney
is
that
this
matter
could
be
used
at
the
main
trail,
the
evidence
had
at
the
preliminary.
and
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
that,
if
the
defendants
will
not
represent
by
the
--
by
counsel
at
preliminary,
any
statements
made
by
them,
so
would
be
inadmissible
at
the
trial.
now
that's
--
appendix
page
50
and
69,
and
record
page
74
that
was
determined
three
times
in
the
motion
to
suppress
evidence
and
mr.
tarter
ask
those
matters.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
appendix
page
50,
69,
and
then
if
your
honors
want
to
use
the
big
transcript
record,
page
74.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
well,
that
was
one
of
the
contentions,
so
that
as
mr.
tarter
pointed
out.
but,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
testimony
at
the
preliminary
is
only
used
occasionally
to
impeach
a
witness.
so,
that
actually
really
don't
operative.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
that
is
would
not
be
in
conflict
with
the
barber
versus
page
which
mr.
justice
marshall
in
that
particular
case,
i
think
they
reach
some
evidence
from
a
preliminary
into
the
main
trial.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
pages
7
and
8
of
my
brief
in
which
i
actually
quoted
the
court
of
appeals
there,
because
it's
well
worded,
the
purpose
of
the
preliminary.
i
couldn't
say
it
better,
i
think
that
covers
it,
to
tell
whether
an
offense
has
been
committed
and
whether
to
hold
a
release
the
accused
and
the
time
of
bail
in
the
appropriate
cases.
those
are
the
purposes
of
the
preliminary.
i
would
like
now
if
the
court
had
no
further
questions
to
go
on
this
matter
of
line
of
this
case
the
court
subsequent
to
the
ruling
in
stovall
versus
denno,
which
declare
that
any
confrontations
after
i
believe
june
12,
1967
as
that
wade
versus
--
wade
and
gilbert
decision
were
not
applicable
as
far
as
requiring
an
attorney.
this
happened
prior
to
wade
or
gilbert.
therefore,
this
would
come
up
before
the
court
on
the
question
of
whether
when
at
this
pretrial
lineup,
when
the
defendant
did
not
have
counsel,
whether
based
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
the
confrontation
was
such
that
so
suggestive
as
to
a
course
of
misidentification.
now,
this
gets
on
the
matter
of
totality
of
circumstances,
which
to
my
way
of
thinking
is
just
does
the
evidence
supported?
now
reading
the
case
over,
the
transcript
--
i
noticed
that
the
first
123
pages
and
i
think
the
appendix
have
sites
those
pages.
now,
that
dealt
with
a
motion
to
suppress
any
state
once
made
by
the
defendants
or
any
statements
that
the
detectives
who
interrogate
defendants
would
testify
to.
as
well
as
any
identification
by
case,
casey
frank
reynolds,
the
prosecuting
witness
in
this
case.
now,
the
state
confess
the
motion
as
to
any
confessions
or
statements
made
to
the
detective
and
any
statements
made
by
the
defendants
in
this
case.
there
were
two
defendants
trying
to
join
in
the
incident.
they
confessed
these
motions,
so
the
only
thing
that
the
court
overruled
was
the
part
about
permitting
mr.
reynolds
to
testify
as
to
identification.
now
the
--
that
brings
us
really
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
which
is
from
record
page
123
through
240
in
the
large
record,
which
i
understand
the
court
in
addition
to
the
little
appendix
we
looked
at.
briefly,
this
case
was
one
in
which
a
man
and
his
wife
had
been
to
coleman,
alabama
on
a
sunday.
i
believe
it
was
july
24,
1966,
they
were
returning
to
their
home
in
bluff
park
which
is
a
suburb
in
birmingham,
they
had
a
flat
tire.
the
man
got
out
to
change
the
flat,
while
he
was
crashed
over
changing
the
tire,
three
men
came
cross,
fired
a
shot,
the
first
hit
him
in
the
neck.
and
then,
one
grabbed
his
wife
and
he
said
that
he
was
about
three
feet
away
from
the
man
who
grabbed
his
wife
and
he
saw
his
face
clearly,
that
was
john
henry
coleman,
he
identified
him
at
the
trial.
mr.
david
w.
clark
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
to
show
that
the
lineup
was
alright.
i
don't
know
really
many
ways
to
show
the
lineup
was
properly,
except
these
ways.
i
want
to
show
that
the
identification,
in
court
identification
was
based
on
something
other
than
viewing
the
lineup.
therefore,
if
the
court
will
indulge
from
a
minute,
i'll
go
into
this.
now,
he
stated
that
about
this
time,
another
car
came
by
the
lights
flashed,
and
these
three
men
ramped
across
the
road
and
as
one,
was
about
ten
feet
away
from
him,
facing
him.
he
took
a
pistol
and
shot
him,
he
said,
“i
recognize
that
man
who
shot
me
as
ode
stevens
and
that
i
saw
his
face,”
and
that's
in
the
record.
now,
mr.
casey
frank
stevens
was
in
the
hospital
for
about
eight
or
nine
days.
they
took
him
to
a
hospital
and
forcing
his
life
safe.
now,
in
september,
i
believe
the
29th,
the
police
brought
in
several
suspects.
they
called
mr.
reynolds
to
come
and
look
at
the
lineup.
there
is
a
little
discussion
about
whether
they
told
him
that
these
were
or
some
of
the
people
who
shot
him
or
not.
he
said
that
he
doesn't
recall
telling
him
that,
but
he
assumed
that
that
was
on
the
purpose
the
least
would
have
to
call
him
if
he
had
done
nothing,
no
violation
of
the
law
in
his
part.
so,
he
went
down
there,
they
brought
these
men
in
the
lineup,
and
i
understand
the
lineup
in
the
birmingham
area,
there's
a
stand
about
four
feet
high
and
the
man
used
the
people
come
by.
he
was
there,
by
himself
and
incidentally
there
were
no
other
prosecuting
witnesses
there
to
compare
notes
as
to
this
one,
as
the
one
or
what
not,
the
case
of
frank
reynolds.
well,
the
first
man
he
saw,
he
said,
“that's
the
man
who
shot
me,”
identified
ode
stevens.
then
they
had
the
other
ones
lined
up,
there
were
six
of
them.
from
this
lineup,
he
picked
two
of
the
men
who
had
been
in
the
assault,
with
intent
to
murder
at
the
night
of
july
the
24th.
now,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
appendix
page
88
and
89.
there
were
six
men
in
this
lineup,
ode
stevens,
if
you
will
notice
was
6'2”,
weighed
a
173
lbs.
they
had
three
men
of
approximately
the
six
feet
arrived
in
the
same
weight
and
size.
now,
coleman
on
the
other
hand,
was
a
short
man,
five
foot
four
and
half
inches
tall.
they
had
three
man
of
his
approximate
size,
one
was
five
foot
seven,
one
was
five
eight,
and
goes
coleman.
this
--
a
reason
i
point
that
out
gentlemen
so
many
cases
are
reversed,
because
you
might
have
something
like
this,
the
prosecuting
witness
would
say,
well
he
was
a
bald
headed
man,
so
they
bring
in
three
or
four
people.
one
is
bald
headed,
and
the
other
three
have
a
lot
of
hair,
well
he
says
well
that's
the
one
who
did
it,
but
what
i'm
pointing
out
here
is
these
were
the
same
size
and
types
of
people.
now,
there
is
only
one
possible
flow,
and
i
don't
think
that's
a
flaw
in
it.
coleman,
one
of
the
defendants
had
on
a
hat.
now,
there
was
no
testimony
at
the
trial
on
the
motion
to
suppress
as
to
the
fact
who
caused
him
to
wear
this
hat,
did
the
police
require
him
to?
he
wore
a
hat
at
the
time
of
the
assault,
somewhere
in
the
--
we
have
just
to
apply
common
sense,
what
was
his
hat
is
up
to
and
did
he
wear
a
hat
all
the
time?
now,
or
did
somebody
require
to
put
it
on.
now,
he
testified
on
the
motion
to
suppress.
he
testified
again
on
the
--
its
principle
trial
i
believe
--
no
where
in
there
did
he
say,
“they
forced
me
to
put
on
a
hat.”
he
had
able
counsel
at
this
trial
4121,
they
didn't
bring
it
up.
so,
it
might
be
assumed
that
he
wore
a
hat.
mr.
david
w.
clark
in
birmingham.
mr.
david
w.
clark
and
i
believe
in
the
city
jail.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes
sir,
it
was
inside.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
as
i
point
out
there
was
--
they're
saying
about
four
feet
high
that
they
walked
across
this
stage.
mr.
david
w.
clark
in
a
room,
yes
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
believe
it
was
birmingham
jail.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes
sir,
in
birmingham.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
it
didn't
say
whether
it's
felt
straw
or
what,
i
just
said
a
hat.
now
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no
sir,
if
that
were
(voice
overlap).
he
just
said
he
have
a
hat
and
it's
mr.
(inaudible),
reynolds
said
that
he
had
the
hat
down
over
his
face,
so
he
couldn't
see
his
face
and
he
asked
him
to
move
his
hat
back
and
followed
it,
which
he
did
and
then,
i
believe
he
took
it
off.
and
an
identification
was
made,
mr.
reynolds
said
he
thought
that
was
the
man
as
he
thought
with
to
make
his
identification
part,
that
he
had
to
remove
his
hat
back,
so
he
could
see
his
face,
that
is
in
the
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
he
see,
with
hat
down
first,
so
he
had
to
move
his
face,
so
he
had
him
pushed
it
to
back
of
his
head.
mr.
david
w.
clark
since
you
mention,
it
wouldn't
--
he
said
he
saw
his
face
at
the
time
that
the
coleman
grabbed
mr.
reynolds'
wife,
and
he
said
he
was
three
feet
away
from
him.
he
said,
“i
saw
his
face.”
so,
i
assume
the
hat
was
up
and
enough
so
he
could
see
the
man's
face.
mr.
david
w.
clark
they
were
from
the
birmingham
area,
i
think
they
gave
their
addresses
here.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
know
that
two
or
three
of
them
were
definitely
arrested,
let's
see
--
somewhere
in
the
record,
there
is
a
evidence
that
i
believe
it
was
coleman
and
hudges
were
arrested
on
escape
charges
from
the
city.
so,
they
were
brought
in,
they
were
arrested,
i'm
definite
with
that.
whether
the
other
two
or
three
were
just
people
brought
in,
i
believe
robert
steel
was
also
brought
in
custody.
mr.
david
w.
clark
he
had
a
hat
on.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
he
--
no,
he
was
in
the
jail,
inside
at
that
time.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
i
realized
that's
unusual,
but
some
people
do
have
few
habits
a
way
--
and
as
i
point
out,
no
way
does
he
say,
“they
made
me
put
a
hat
on.”
now,
he
does
say
in
the
record,
he
said,
“they
made
me
say
certain
words.”
he
says,
“they
made
me
say
certain
words."
they
made
ode
stevens
say
certain
words,
and
they
made
hudges
say
certain
words,
none
of
the
others.
now,
that
is
a
variance
with
the
testimony
of
mr.
reynolds
prosecuting
witness,
he
said
that
he
wanted
them
to
say
something
and
the
police
would
not
let
in
and
those
people
say
a
word,
the
people
in
the
lineup.
so,
he
couldn't
identify
by
the
words
getting
into
the
woods
or
anything
of
that
nature.
now,
i
believe
lieutenant
hart,
a
detective
said
that
he
thought
all
six
of
them
did,
but
and
then
i
believe
another
one
detective
stated
that
yes,
they
said
that
it
was
after
mr.
reynolds
have
made
the
identification.
now,
we
feel
that
this
lineup
was
fair,
that
this
prosecuting
witness
made
the
identification.
he
saw
the
people
who
had
shot
him,
who
were
involved
in
that
night.
now,
when
he
came
to
trial,
we
appoint
this
out
that
he
made
his
identification,
he
said,
“those
are
the
men,
stevens
is
the
man
that
shot
me
that
night,
and
coleman
is
the
man
that
was
three
feet
away
from
me
and
grab
my
wife,
i
saw
both
of
their
faces.”
so,
what
i'm
pointing
out
is
that
the
--
in
court
identification
was
not
made
from
what
he
had
seen
at
the
lineup,
but
rather
what
he
had
seen
at
the
time
the
assault
was
committed.
i
feel
that
on
the
--
circumstances,
that
is
the
real,
meaning
coconut
so
to
speak
is
whether
or
not
the
identification
was
based
on
either
some
pictures
or
somebody
he
saw
in
the
lineup
and
then
he
comes
into
court
and
makes
an
in
court
identification
of
whether
it
was
something
separate
and
apart
from
the
lineup.
we
maintain
here
with
something
separate
the
border
line.
mr.
david
w.
clark
as
i
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
car
coming
on
to
this
darken
road
and
lights
flashed
on
these
people
and
the
three
men
who
were
involved
in
the
assault,
rushed
across
the
road
and
got
in
their
car
and
left.
and
the
person
who
was
driving
by
stopped
and
picked
up
this
casey
frank
reynolds
and
took
him
to
the
hospital.
he
was
shot
once
in
the
throat
and
once
in
the
neck.
there's
a
possibility
he
could
have
bled
to
death,
as
somebody
not
stopped.
mr.
david
w.
clark
on
the
green
springs
highway,
which
is
i'm
saying
just
off
a
highway
31
going
towards
bluff
park.
this
is
not
a
well
lighted
highway,
your
honor.
probably
know
and
just
candid.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
was
all
hand
in
cross
examination.
in
other
words,
the
defense
attorney
had
every
opportunity
to
cross
examination,
the
court
did
not
record
his
cross
examination
on.
i
feel
that
just
about
covers
the
matter,
my
time
is
getting
short
here.
if
the
court
would
like
to
ask
me
for
further
question,
i
would
be
glad
to
answer
it.
mr.
david
w.
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
only
matter
had
been
discussed
so
far
and
that
is
the
question
of
preliminary
hearing
in
alabama.
i
would
like
to
take
issue
with
my
opponent
on
that.
the
preliminary
hearing
in
alabama
is
one
of
these
things
in
which
an
accused
may
ask
for
a
preliminary
hearing.
now,
when
there
is
preliminary
hearing,
the
magistrate
looks
into
the
matter.
first,
at
the
time
whenever
an
offense
has
been
committed
and
then
if
the
probable
cause
that
the
person
there
committed
the
offense.
and
then,
if
that
be
so,
it
is
such
a
matter,
which
is
subject
to
bail.
now,
in
the
largest
cities,
right
they
are
in
a
place
that
preliminary
is
used
in
alabama.
and
the
reason
for
that
is,
these
accused
want
to
get
out
on
bail,
that's
their
avenue
to
get
bail
in
alabama,
is
what
it
amounts
to.
mr.
david
w.
clark
oh,
if
they
wanted
and
they
can
request.
that's
what
it
said,
they
may
request
a
preliminary
in
any
thought
of
the
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
he
did
ask
for
preliminary.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
think
that
is
correct
sir.
he
asked
for
a
preliminary
hearing
and
it
was
had
on
october
14,
1966.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
think
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
you
may,
you
could
file
a
--
and
get
that
and
they
would
say
they
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
it
could
be
said
by
the
judge
or
the
clerk
of
the
court
sometime
in
the
small
amount
of
misdemeanors
and
so
forth,
but
if
a
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
a
serious
offense.
mr.
david
w.
clark
is
to
get
bail
in
a
more
serious
offense.
this
one
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
to
get
--
that's
the
only
way
they
can
get
it
in
a
most
--
the
law
said
to
that
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
it
sets
out
the
title
15,
section
138
and
139-40,
i
think
sets
out
the
ways
of
having
a
preliminary
hearing
to
set
bail.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
if
it's
a
bailable
offense.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
in
very
minor
misdemeanor
cases.
mr.
david
w.
clark
if
the
accused
does
not
asked
for
a
preliminary
hearing,
your
honor,
then,
when
the
grand
jury
meets,
the
matter
maybe
presented
to
the
grand
jury,
and
indictment
returned,
and
then
of
course,
you
have
the
arraignment
entry.
mr.
david
w.
clark
in
effect,
yes
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
right.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir,
he
did.
usually,
at
least
going
on
that
when
they
ask
indictment
return,
the
judge
sets
bail
on
that.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
the
time
of
the
arraignment,
they
register
a
trial
then.
the
arraignment
sir
is
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
not
that
quickly,
but
at
that
time
of
the
arraignment,
they
could
of
course,
and
oppose
any
pleas
they
want
to
put
in
there
in
that
time.
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
if
thats
the
--
if
mr.
tarter
pointed
out,
if
there
has
been
on
offense
committee,
if
this
particular
person
accused
is
the
one
who
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
oh,
yes.
i
was
about
to
point
out
that
was
one
of
the
things.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
is
a
matter
as
mr.
tarter
has
pointed
out
that
is
required
in
the
code
and
there
is
a
provision
that
is
not
done,
the
magistrate
could
be
fine.
now,
that
is
sometimes
done
and
sometimes
it
isn't.
i
mean
as
far
as
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
no
i
--
as
a
recording
of
the
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
think
it
is
just
as
mr.
tarter
has
pointed
out
that
defense
attorneys
have
it
done.
i
do
have
a
case
from
birmingham
area
now,
i
believe
at
2917,
the
next
city,
in
which
a
preliminary
was
had
and
it
was
recorded
and
they
used
that
sometimes
to
as
mr.
tarter
pointed
out
to
impeach
a
witness.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no.
mr.
david
w.
clark
in
defense
in
that
case.
now,--
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
don't
know
this
one
matches.
that
is
--
at
that
time,
i
think
mr.
tarter
said
he
was
court
appointed,
so
i
assumed
the
man
did
not
have
money
to
pay
for
it.
now,
one
of
the
contentions
of
mr.
tarter
of
those
17
contentions,
he
points
out
in
his
brief
the
reason
you
should
have
an
attorney
is
that
this
matter
could
be
used
at
the
main
trail,
the
evidence
had
at
the
preliminary.
and
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
that,
if
the
defendants
will
not
represent
by
the
--
by
counsel
at
preliminary,
any
statements
made
by
them,
so
would
be
inadmissible
at
the
trial.
now
that's
--
appendix
page
50
and
69,
and
record
page
74
that
was
determined
three
times
in
the
motion
to
suppress
evidence
and
mr.
tarter
ask
those
matters.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
appendix
page
50,
69,
and
then
if
your
honors
want
to
use
the
big
transcript
record,
page
74.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
well,
that
was
one
of
the
contentions,
so
that
as
mr.
tarter
pointed
out.
but,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
testimony
at
the
preliminary
is
only
used
occasionally
to
impeach
a
witness.
so,
that
actually
really
don't
operative.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
that
is
would
not
be
in
conflict
with
the
barber
versus
page
which
mr.
justice
marshall
in
that
particular
case,
i
think
they
reach
some
evidence
from
a
preliminary
into
the
main
trial.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
pages
7
and
8
of
my
brief
in
which
i
actually
quoted
the
court
of
appeals
there,
because
it's
well
worded,
the
purpose
of
the
preliminary.
i
couldn't
say
it
better,
i
think
that
covers
it,
to
tell
whether
an
offense
has
been
committed
and
whether
to
hold
a
release
the
accused
and
the
time
of
bail
in
the
appropriate
cases.
those
are
the
purposes
of
the
preliminary.
i
would
like
now
if
the
court
had
no
further
questions
to
go
on
this
matter
of
line
of
this
case
the
court
subsequent
to
the
ruling
in
stovall
versus
denno,
which
declare
that
any
confrontations
after
i
believe
june
12,
1967
as
that
wade
versus
--
wade
and
gilbert
decision
were
not
applicable
as
far
as
requiring
an
attorney.
this
happened
prior
to
wade
or
gilbert.
therefore,
this
would
come
up
before
the
court
on
the
question
of
whether
when
at
this
pretrial
lineup,
when
the
defendant
did
not
have
counsel,
whether
based
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
the
confrontation
was
such
that
so
suggestive
as
to
a
course
of
misidentification.
now,
this
gets
on
the
matter
of
totality
of
circumstances,
which
to
my
way
of
thinking
is
just
does
the
evidence
supported?
now
reading
the
case
over,
the
transcript
--
i
noticed
that
the
first
123
pages
and
i
think
the
appendix
have
sites
those
pages.
now,
that
dealt
with
a
motion
to
suppress
any
state
once
made
by
the
defendants
or
any
statements
that
the
detectives
who
interrogate
defendants
would
testify
to.
as
well
as
any
identification
by
case,
casey
frank
reynolds,
the
prosecuting
witness
in
this
case.
now,
the
state
confess
the
motion
as
to
any
confessions
or
statements
made
to
the
detective
and
any
statements
made
by
the
defendants
in
this
case.
there
were
two
defendants
trying
to
join
in
the
incident.
they
confessed
these
motions,
so
the
only
thing
that
the
court
overruled
was
the
part
about
permitting
mr.
reynolds
to
testify
as
to
identification.
now
the
--
that
brings
us
really
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
which
is
from
record
page
123
through
240
in
the
large
record,
which
i
understand
the
court
in
addition
to
the
little
appendix
we
looked
at.
briefly,
this
case
was
one
in
which
a
man
and
his
wife
had
been
to
coleman,
alabama
on
a
sunday.
i
believe
it
was
july
24,
1966,
they
were
returning
to
their
home
in
bluff
park
which
is
a
suburb
in
birmingham,
they
had
a
flat
tire.
the
man
got
out
to
change
the
flat,
while
he
was
crashed
over
changing
the
tire,
three
men
came
cross,
fired
a
shot,
the
first
hit
him
in
the
neck.
and
then,
one
grabbed
his
wife
and
he
said
that
he
was
about
three
feet
away
from
the
man
who
grabbed
his
wife
and
he
saw
his
face
clearly,
that
was
john
henry
coleman,
he
identified
him
at
the
trial.
mr.
david
w.
clark
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
to
show
that
the
lineup
was
alright.
i
don't
know
really
many
ways
to
show
the
lineup
was
properly,
except
these
ways.
i
want
to
show
that
the
identification,
in
court
identification
was
based
on
something
other
than
viewing
the
lineup.
therefore,
if
the
court
will
indulge
from
a
minute,
i'll
go
into
this.
now,
he
stated
that
about
this
time,
another
car
came
by
the
lights
flashed,
and
these
three
men
ramped
across
the
road
and
as
one,
was
about
ten
feet
away
from
him,
facing
him.
he
took
a
pistol
and
shot
him,
he
said,
“i
recognize
that
man
who
shot
me
as
ode
stevens
and
that
i
saw
his
face,”
and
that's
in
the
record.
now,
mr.
casey
frank
stevens
was
in
the
hospital
for
about
eight
or
nine
days.
they
took
him
to
a
hospital
and
forcing
his
life
safe.
now,
in
september,
i
believe
the
29th,
the
police
brought
in
several
suspects.
they
called
mr.
reynolds
to
come
and
look
at
the
lineup.
there
is
a
little
discussion
about
whether
they
told
him
that
these
were
or
some
of
the
people
who
shot
him
or
not.
he
said
that
he
doesn't
recall
telling
him
that,
but
he
assumed
that
that
was
on
the
purpose
the
least
would
have
to
call
him
if
he
had
done
nothing,
no
violation
of
the
law
in
his
part.
so,
he
went
down
there,
they
brought
these
men
in
the
lineup,
and
i
understand
the
lineup
in
the
birmingham
area,
there's
a
stand
about
four
feet
high
and
the
man
used
the
people
come
by.
he
was
there,
by
himself
and
incidentally
there
were
no
other
prosecuting
witnesses
there
to
compare
notes
as
to
this
one,
as
the
one
or
what
not,
the
case
of
frank
reynolds.
well,
the
first
man
he
saw,
he
said,
“that's
the
man
who
shot
me,”
identified
ode
stevens.
then
they
had
the
other
ones
lined
up,
there
were
six
of
them.
from
this
lineup,
he
picked
two
of
the
men
who
had
been
in
the
assault,
with
intent
to
murder
at
the
night
of
july
the
24th.
now,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
appendix
page
88
and
89.
there
were
six
men
in
this
lineup,
ode
stevens,
if
you
will
notice
was
6'2”,
weighed
a
173
lbs.
they
had
three
men
of
approximately
the
six
feet
arrived
in
the
same
weight
and
size.
now,
coleman
on
the
other
hand,
was
a
short
man,
five
foot
four
and
half
inches
tall.
they
had
three
man
of
his
approximate
size,
one
was
five
foot
seven,
one
was
five
eight,
and
goes
coleman.
this
--
a
reason
i
point
that
out
gentlemen
so
many
cases
are
reversed,
because
you
might
have
something
like
this,
the
prosecuting
witness
would
say,
well
he
was
a
bald
headed
man,
so
they
bring
in
three
or
four
people.
one
is
bald
headed,
and
the
other
three
have
a
lot
of
hair,
well
he
says
well
that's
the
one
who
did
it,
but
what
i'm
pointing
out
here
is
these
were
the
same
size
and
types
of
people.
now,
there
is
only
one
possible
flow,
and
i
don't
think
that's
a
flaw
in
it.
coleman,
one
of
the
defendants
had
on
a
hat.
now,
there
was
no
testimony
at
the
trial
on
the
motion
to
suppress
as
to
the
fact
who
caused
him
to
wear
this
hat,
did
the
police
require
him
to?
he
wore
a
hat
at
the
time
of
the
assault,
somewhere
in
the
--
we
have
just
to
apply
common
sense,
what
was
his
hat
is
up
to
and
did
he
wear
a
hat
all
the
time?
now,
or
did
somebody
require
to
put
it
on.
now,
he
testified
on
the
motion
to
suppress.
he
testified
again
on
the
--
its
principle
trial
i
believe
--
no
where
in
there
did
he
say,
“they
forced
me
to
put
on
a
hat.”
he
had
able
counsel
at
this
trial
4121,
they
didn't
bring
it
up.
so,
it
might
be
assumed
that
he
wore
a
hat.
mr.
david
w.
clark
in
birmingham.
mr.
david
w.
clark
and
i
believe
in
the
city
jail.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes
sir,
it
was
inside.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
as
i
point
out
there
was
--
they're
saying
about
four
feet
high
that
they
walked
across
this
stage.
mr.
david
w.
clark
in
a
room,
yes
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
believe
it
was
birmingham
jail.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes
sir,
in
birmingham.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
it
didn't
say
whether
it's
felt
straw
or
what,
i
just
said
a
hat.
now
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no
sir,
if
that
were
(voice
overlap).
he
just
said
he
have
a
hat
and
it's
mr.
(inaudible),
reynolds
said
that
he
had
the
hat
down
over
his
face,
so
he
couldn't
see
his
face
and
he
asked
him
to
move
his
hat
back
and
followed
it,
which
he
did
and
then,
i
believe
he
took
it
off.
and
an
identification
was
made,
mr.
reynolds
said
he
thought
that
was
the
man
as
he
thought
with
to
make
his
identification
part,
that
he
had
to
remove
his
hat
back,
so
he
could
see
his
face,
that
is
in
the
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
he
see,
with
hat
down
first,
so
he
had
to
move
his
face,
so
he
had
him
pushed
it
to
back
of
his
head.
mr.
david
w.
clark
since
you
mention,
it
wouldn't
--
he
said
he
saw
his
face
at
the
time
that
the
coleman
grabbed
mr.
reynolds'
wife,
and
he
said
he
was
three
feet
away
from
him.
he
said,
“i
saw
his
face.”
so,
i
assume
the
hat
was
up
and
enough
so
he
could
see
the
man's
face.
mr.
david
w.
clark
they
were
from
the
birmingham
area,
i
think
they
gave
their
addresses
here.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
know
that
two
or
three
of
them
were
definitely
arrested,
let's
see
--
somewhere
in
the
record,
there
is
a
evidence
that
i
believe
it
was
coleman
and
hudges
were
arrested
on
escape
charges
from
the
city.
so,
they
were
brought
in,
they
were
arrested,
i'm
definite
with
that.
whether
the
other
two
or
three
were
just
people
brought
in,
i
believe
robert
steel
was
also
brought
in
custody.
mr.
david
w.
clark
he
had
a
hat
on.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
he
--
no,
he
was
in
the
jail,
inside
at
that
time.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
i
realized
that's
unusual,
but
some
people
do
have
few
habits
a
way
--
and
as
i
point
out,
no
way
does
he
say,
“they
made
me
put
a
hat
on.”
now,
he
does
say
in
the
record,
he
said,
“they
made
me
say
certain
words.”
he
says,
“they
made
me
say
certain
words."
they
made
ode
stevens
say
certain
words,
and
they
made
hudges
say
certain
words,
none
of
the
others.
now,
that
is
a
variance
with
the
testimony
of
mr.
reynolds
prosecuting
witness,
he
said
that
he
wanted
them
to
say
something
and
the
police
would
not
let
in
and
those
people
say
a
word,
the
people
in
the
lineup.
so,
he
couldn't
identify
by
the
words
getting
into
the
woods
or
anything
of
that
nature.
now,
i
believe
lieutenant
hart,
a
detective
said
that
he
thought
all
six
of
them
did,
but
and
then
i
believe
another
one
detective
stated
that
yes,
they
said
that
it
was
after
mr.
reynolds
have
made
the
identification.
now,
we
feel
that
this
lineup
was
fair,
that
this
prosecuting
witness
made
the
identification.
he
saw
the
people
who
had
shot
him,
who
were
involved
in
that
night.
now,
when
he
came
to
trial,
we
appoint
this
out
that
he
made
his
identification,
he
said,
“those
are
the
men,
stevens
is
the
man
that
shot
me
that
night,
and
coleman
is
the
man
that
was
three
feet
away
from
me
and
grab
my
wife,
i
saw
both
of
their
faces.”
so,
what
i'm
pointing
out
is
that
the
--
in
court
identification
was
not
made
from
what
he
had
seen
at
the
lineup,
but
rather
what
he
had
seen
at
the
time
the
assault
was
committed.
i
feel
that
on
the
--
circumstances,
that
is
the
real,
meaning
coconut
so
to
speak
is
whether
or
not
the
identification
was
based
on
either
some
pictures
or
somebody
he
saw
in
the
lineup
and
then
he
comes
into
court
and
makes
an
in
court
identification
of
whether
it
was
something
separate
and
apart
from
the
lineup.
we
maintain
here
with
something
separate
the
border
line.
mr.
david
w.
clark
as
i
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
car
coming
on
to
this
darken
road
and
lights
flashed
on
these
people
and
the
three
men
who
were
involved
in
the
assault,
rushed
across
the
road
and
got
in
their
car
and
left.
and
the
person
who
was
driving
by
stopped
and
picked
up
this
casey
frank
reynolds
and
took
him
to
the
hospital.
he
was
shot
once
in
the
throat
and
once
in
the
neck.
there's
a
possibility
he
could
have
bled
to
death,
as
somebody
not
stopped.
mr.
david
w.
clark
on
the
green
springs
highway,
which
is
i'm
saying
just
off
a
highway
31
going
towards
bluff
park.
this
is
not
a
well
lighted
highway,
your
honor.
probably
know
and
just
candid.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
was
all
hand
in
cross
examination.
in
other
words,
the
defense
attorney
had
every
opportunity
to
cross
examination,
the
court
did
not
record
his
cross
examination
on.
i
feel
that
just
about
covers
the
matter,
my
time
is
getting
short
here.
if
the
court
would
like
to
ask
me
for
further
question,
i
would
be
glad
to
answer
it.
