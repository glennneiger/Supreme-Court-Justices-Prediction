against
alabama.
mr.
tarter,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
let
me
clear
up
one
thing
from
my
own
situation.
at
the
time
the
--
an
accused
or
a
person
goes
to
preliminary
hearing
in
alabama,
is
he
then
a
defendant
as
any
charge
been
launched
against
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
me
ask
this
if
i
may
interrupt,
did
you
say
to
examine
the
witnesses
against
him?
do
you
mean
by
that
the
witnesses
who
are
produced
at
the
hearing
or
all
witnesses
who
will
be
produced
at
the
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
respect
then
its
parallels
of
the
federal
situation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
alabama
statute
contemplates
that
the
preliminary
hearing
is
to
be
a
discovery
mechanism?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
probable
cause
for
what?
to
upholding
or
holding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
i
would
give
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
in
transcript,
when
you
make
that
your
own
instance
have
official
status?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
that
after
lunch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
proceed
mr.
tarter.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
supreme
court.
over
three
minutes
of
my
time,
the
first
20
minutes
has
expired
now,
i
haven't
even
gotten
to
the
second
point
here.
however,
i
was
about
to
tell
you
a
case,
i
will
say
it
is
a
preliminarily.
the
state
contends
that
the
preliminary
hearing
is
not
critical,
counsel
is
not
necessary,
you
will
have
a
note
from
my
brief
that
the
state
always
has
counsel
present
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
they
always
have
counsel
present
to
represent
them
and
to
examine
the
witnesses
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
now,
my
clients
did
not
have
counsel
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
clark.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
your
friend
told
us
that
sheriff
occasionally
set
bail?
is
that
just
in
minor
offense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
he
secure
bail
after
the
indictment,
by
applying
to
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
give
me
those
pages
again.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
trial
of
the
case,
was
there
cross
examination
of
the
complaining
witness
as
to
the
source
of
his
identification,
whether
he
recalled
the
faces
from
the
night
of
the
attack
and
that
typical
cross
examination
of
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
not
mr.
clark,
thank
you
very
much.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
did
cross
examine
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
can
move
these
things
later
counsel.
you
can
move,
following
the
preliminary
hearing
motions
on
all
of
those
subjects,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
they
testify?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
he
had
been
called
at
your
earliest
stages
and
asked
to
testify
what
had
taken
place
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
was
any
effort
made
to
get
his
testimony?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
the
judge's
testimony,
about
what
went
on
at
the
preliminary
hearing
to
reconstruct
the
record.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
this
is
not
the
question
that
we
have
been
pointed
out
at,
at
least
that
i
have,
the
question
was,
did
anyone
prevent
you
from
calling
the
judge
who
held
the
preliminary
hearing
and
have
that
judge
testify
in
a
hearing
what
had
taken
place.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
that
one
thing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
i
read
that
part
of
the
transcript
counsel,
you
offered
to
prove
by
lawyers,
the
importance
and
devaluing
of
the
presence
of
the
lawyer
at
a
preliminary
hearing
and
i
do
not
recall
that
you
had
anything
in
your
proffer
relating
to
what
the
judge
would
say.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
at
the
time
from
examining
this
record,
anything
that
shed
light
on
this,
you
have
liberty
to
call
our
attention
to
a
specific
part
of
the
record,
in
which
it
appears
and
of
course,
send
your
friend
a
copy
of
whatever
you
send
us.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
right.
now
mr.
