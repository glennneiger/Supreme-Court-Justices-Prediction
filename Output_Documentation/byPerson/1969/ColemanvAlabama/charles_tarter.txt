mr.
charles
tarter
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
july
24,
1966,
in
the
city
of
birmingham,
alabama
on
a
dimly
lit
highway
in
jefferson
county
of
alabama,
several
black
individuals
attacked
a
white
man
and
his
wife
on
the
side
of
the
road,
while
they
were
fixing
a
flat
on
their
car.
these
black
individuals
fired
a
pistol
twice
into
the
body
of
the
gentleman
fixing
the
car.
a
passing
car
coerced
the
individuals
to
flee
from
the
scene
and
on
september
29,
1969,
approximately
1966
--
i
beg
your
pardon
approximately
2
months
later,
they
were
arrested.
they
were
interrogated.
they
were
placed
in
a
line
up.
they
were
taken
before
a
magistrate
for
a
preliminary
hearing.
they
were
arraigned,
they
were
tried,
they
were
convicted
just
this
case
has
sort
his
way
to
this
court.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
preliminary
hearing
is
a
critical
stage
in
the
proceedings
of
a
criminal
case,
requiring
the
presence
of
counsel.
however,
the
real
case
here,
real
issue
here
if
with
regard
to
a
poor
man
being
a
defendant
in
a
preliminary
hearing.
the
sixth
amendment
says,
“in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
have
the
assistance
of
counsel
for
his
defense.”
and
i
suggest
to
you
there
weren't
not
for
the
fact
that
these
defendants
are
poor,
they
would
not
be
here
today.
the
court
has
interpreted
the
sixth
amendment
to
mean
that
counsel
is
needed
at
the
accusatory
stage,
at
the
interrogation,
at
the
lineup,
at
the
arraignment,
at
the
trial,
at
the
appeal,
at
the
probation
hearing.
but
it
has
excused
and
ignored
the
preliminary
hearing,
which
is
probably
the
most
single,
most
important
phase
of
criminal
procedure.
in
my
county,
these
defendants
could
be
tried
at
the
county
courthouse
without
a
lawyer
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
they
could
walk
three
blocks
down
the
street
and
have
a
lawyer
at
the
preliminary
hearing
at
the
federal
court.
to
me
that
is
not
equal
and
exact
justice.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
tarter
getting
to
it
right
--
in
just
a
moment,
if
your
honor
please
i've
listed
17
reasons
in
my
brief.
the
court
in
the
past
has
refused
to
call
the
preliminary
hearing
critical
because
a
plea
was
not
required,
in
white
versus
maryland
once
again
in
pointer
versus
texas.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
sir.
a
warrant
has
obtained
after
his
arrest.
he
lodged
in
the
city
jail,
warrant
is
obtained
after
his
arrest,
he
had
taken
over
to
the
county
jail.
a
bond
is
set
by
the
sheriff,
with
the
exception
of
a
capital
case.
and
then
he
has
taken
forthwith
within
ten
days
before
magistrate,
usually
within
ten
days,
before
magistrate
and
there
preliminary
hearing
is
held
or
resemblance
of
a
preliminary
hearing
without
a
lawyer.
mr.
charles
tarter
that's
a
very
confusing
case,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
charles
tarter
--
they
called
in
an
arraignment
and
then
the
court
talks
about
a
preliminary
hearing
--
mr.
charles
tarter
it
wasn't
arraigned.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
sir.
this
is
the
preliminary
hearing,
which
after
preliminary
hearing
comes
the
grand
jury
action,
then
comes
the
indictment,
then
comes
the
arraignment.
mr.
charles
tarter
then
comes
the
trial.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes.
mr.
charles
tarter
it's
understandable
however
that
the
hamilton
case
is
confusing,
because
of
the
preliminary
--
being
called
a
preliminary
hearing
and
really
is
not,
it's
an
arraignment,
where
plea
is
required.
our
statute
is
very
similar
to
the
statute
in
the
case
of
pointer
versus
--
in
texas,
in
the
case
of
pointer
versus
texas.
there
the
court
said,
the
preliminary
hearing
is
not
a
critical
stage,
because
a
plea
was
not
required,
almost
a
verbatim
statement
as
within
the
white
case.
however,
the
court
said
and
i
quote
from
their
opinion,
“whether
there
might
be
other
circumstances
making
a
preliminary
hearing,
so
critical
as
a
defendant,
as
to
call
for
an
appointment
of
counsel.”
at
that
stage
we
need
not
decide
on
this
record
and
that
question
we
reserve.
it
is
the
question
which
you
have
decided
in
--
which
you
have
reserved
in
pointer
versus
texas
that
we
raise
here.
to
answer
mr.
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
would
say
the
--
all
for
these
reasons
as
to
why
preliminary
hearing
is
important
and
encompasses
more
than
simply
probably
cause
or
whether
or
not
a
plea
is
required.
one,
it
is
the
first
opportunity
that
the
defendant
has
to
be
adequately
informed
by
an
allegedly
impartial
person
of
that
which
he
is
charged.
two,
it
is
the
first
opportunity
to
be
confronted
by
those
who
will
testify
against
him.
three,
it
is
the
first
opportunity
to
examine
those
who
will
testify
against
him
and
have
their
testimony
reduced
to
writing.
mr.
charles
tarter
all
other
witnesses
produced
at
the
hearing
and
all
of
the
witnesses
subpoenaed
by
the
defendant
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf.
and
any
other
witnesses
that
counsel
can
find
the
subpoena
ought
to
have
present
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
sense
that
--
in
a
federal
court,
obviously
the
reason
why
preliminary
hearings
are
not
held,
numerous
preliminary
hearing
are
not
held,
because
of
the
liberal
discovery
rules
and
in
the
federal
court.
however,
in
the
state
court,
there
practically
no
discovery
rules
whatsoever.
when
a
lawyer
is
appointed,
such
as
i
was
in
this
case.
just
before
the
arraignment,
find
absolutely
nothing
about
the
case,
nothing.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
was
appointed
the
day
before
the
case
was
arraigned
and
this
was
a
case
of
great
publicity.
they
were
out
for
two
months,
before
they
were
arrested.
newspaper
headlines
for
weeks
and
days
and
months,
until
they
were
arrested.
people
were
upset.
money
was
solicited
by
groups
to
help
pay
for
the
hospital
bill
and
these
old
things
of
the
victim's
and
it
was
a
heinous
and
terrible
crime.
but
the
point
is
that
i
had
nothing
--
i
couldn't
even
talk
to
the
witness,
until
the
day
the
motions
were
tried
before
his
honor
judge
gideon,
who
phoned
the
direction
to
the
district
attorney.
mr.
charles
tarter
it
says,
if
your
honor
please,
that
it
is
to
determine
probable
cause
and
to
--
mr.
charles
tarter
to
bind
the
defendant
over
to
the
grand
jury.
as
your
honor,
is
well
aware
of
course
probable
cause
means
more
than
just
a
brief
statement
by
some
individual
that
an
act
occurred
in
a
particular
venue
and
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
tarter
in
hamilton,
the
case
was
in
arraignment
and
not
a
preliminary
hearing,
if
your
honor
please.
it
is
confusing,
i
have
--
mr.
charles
tarter
the
arraignment
comes
after
the
preliminary
hearing
and
subsequent
to
the
indictment.
the
arraignment
is
where
the
indictment
is
read
to
the
defendant
and
a
plea
is
entered
at
that
time.
but
no
lawyer
who
is
ever
tried
a
criminal
case
in
alabama
or
anywhere
else
in
a
state
court,
where
preliminary
hearing
is
offered.
what
they're
testifying
that
is
not
important.
it
is
probably
the
single
most
critical
stage
of
all
the
proceedings.
it
reduces
a
trial
to
a
mere
formality.
mr.
charles
tarter
it
could,
if
your
honor
please.
it
could
do
that,
however
we
have
introduced
into
our
brief
and
into
the
trial
of
the
motion
that
before
his
honor
judge
gibson.
that
95%
of
all
cases
tried
in
jefferson
county
and
--
are
taken
by
way
of
the
preliminary
hearing.
very,
very
few,
as
a
matter
i
can't
even
remember
one,
since
i've
been
practicing
law,
which
is
five
years,
where
the
case
was
taken
directly
to
the
grand
jury
without
going
to
the
preliminary
hearings,
just
a
matter
of
procedure.
mr.
charles
tarter
they
could
do
it,
yes.
they
could
do
it,
but
if
they
did,
of
course
in
populous
county,
such
as
jefferson
county,
they
might
be
there
five
years
before
they
ever
got
to
trial.
if
every
case
had
to
go
before
the
grand
jury
that
upon
which
a
warrant
is
thrown
out
on
a
felony,
it's
just
not
possible.
so,
if
the
preliminary
hearing
weaves
the
cases
out,
so
to
speak,
before
they
get
to
the
grand
jury.
of
course,
there's
17
reasons
listed
in
my
brief,
i
--
of
course
have
collected
manually,
read
the
brief.
there's
really
no
need
in
my
--
just
reading
out
of
my
brief,
the
17
points
that
just
first
came
into
my
mind,
they're
on
page
11
and
page
12,
and
page
13
of
my
brief,
which
list
the
many,
many
reasons
for
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
charles
tarter
discovery
is
the
most
emphasis.
motion
to
suppress
many
times
has
been
very
favorable.
the
--
in
many
cases
have
been
dismissed
in
the
preliminary
hearing,
as
a
result
to
motion
to
suppress.
therefore,
the
man
hasn't
had
to
sit
in
jail,
and
hasn't
had
to
--
have
his
liberty
restrained
over
six
months
or
nine
months
that
it
takes
to
get
to
the
trial
and
to
the
merits
of
the
issue.
not
to
mention
the
practical
aspect
of
it
that
you
have
a
good
motion
to
suppress
then
the
state
will
let
it
pass
for
two
years,
and
then
eventually
it
would
be
dismissed.
but
your
client
and
i
have
several
of
these
as
many
lawyers
do
rather
than
the
case
just
being
dismissed.
but
it
is
the
question
reserved
in
pointers
versus
texas
that
we
applied
this
particular
case
to.
now
--
mr.
charles
tarter
well,
then
he
awaits
the
action
of
the
grand
jury.
then
the
grand
jury
acts
and
an
indictment
is
presented,
then
an
arraignment
is
held.
and
counsel
appointed
if
necessary.
mr.
charles
tarter
and
then
a
plea
is
entered,
and
then
a
trial.
mr.
charles
tarter
well,
that's
possible,
it
is
possible.
mr.
charles
tarter
no,
just
in
indictment.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
it's
possible
of
course,
the
grand
jury
wouldn't
indict
him,
but
i
suggested
that
if
the
grand
jury
would
indict
him,
it
would
be
dismissed
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
charles
tarter
well,
of
course
we
--
anything
is
possible,
i
suppose,
but
several
years
trying
dozen
of
criminal
cases
before
the
preliminary
hearing,
both
of
them
that
are
dismissed
or
simply
dismissed.
mr.
charles
tarter
our
district
attorney
controls
the
grand
jury,
if
your
honor
please,
he's
the
only
one
in
the
grand
jury
room.
mr.
charles
tarter
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
charles
tarter
the
district
attorney
controls
the
grand
jury,
he's
only
one
in
the
grand
jury,
it's
his
witnesses
that
testify
before
the
grand
jury.
so,
i
would
be
shocked
and
amazed
that
if
the
case
were
dismissed
by
the
preliminary
hearing
magistrate
that
the
case
will
be
picked
up
by
the
grand
jury.
mr.
charles
tarter
anywhere
from
30
to
90
days.
mr.
charles
tarter
well,
that's
another
question,
he
is
entitled
to
bail
of
course.
my
client
is
a
--
due
to
the
publicity
case,
had
$20,000.00
bond
set
on
both
of
them
at
the
preliminary
hearing
without
a
lawyer,
they
have
been
sitting
in
jail,
since
july
29th
--
i
mean
since
september
29,
1969.
of
course,
they
couldn't
make
a
$200.00
bond,
but
a
$20,000.00
bond
on
each
of
them.
of
course,
they
had
no
counsel
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
if
they
have
had
counsel
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
this
case
very
well
could
have
been
won,
if
you
read
my
brief
carefully.
mr.
charles
tarter
that's
an
unusual
thing,
justice
black
probably
is
aware
of
this.
what
is
over
75
years
we've
had
a
statute
which
requires
that
the
transcript
be
--
the
testimony
be
transcribed,
recorded
and
certified
to
the
circuit
court,
it
has
never
been
done,
ever.
it
is
completely
ignored,
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do.
mr.
charles
tarter
never
gone
to
the
grand
jury,
and
we
as
defense
lawyers
pay
for
court
reporter
to
go
to
the
preliminary
hearing
and
record
the
testimony
and
use
it
later
on,
in
view
of
the
statute.
their
statute
offered
a
corporal
punishment,
for
his
--
honor,
failing
to
record
and
transcribe
this
testimony,
unfortunately
i
had
never
had
encourage
enough
to
enforce
them.
but
this
is
not
only
true
in
alabama,
it
isn't
true
in
many
other
states,
things
such
as
this
being
ignored.
mr.
charles
tarter
that's
right.
mr.
charles
tarter
if
i
had
been
there,
if
i've
got
appointed
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
i
would
have
paid
for
out
of
my
own
pocket
and
had
one
made
in
this
case,
as
i
did
in
another
case.
now,
i
represent
no
group,
and
i
represent
no
organization.
i
represent
my
client,
period
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
in
this
court.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
because
i
bring
the
court
reporter
and
testify
to
its
validity,
you
see.
it
does
not
have
official
status,
in
the
sense
that
it's
a
part
of
the
court
record.
only
when
i
introduce
an
evidence
and
prove
its
validity
and
accuracy.
but
then
--
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
it
is.
one
of
official
--
mr.
charles
tarter
no,
and
they
try
to
get
my
copy,
once
get
it
done.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
let
me
--
it's
really
ridiculous
and
it's
a
vicious
circle,
so
to
speak,
but
let
me
give
you
a
primary
example
of
a
preliminary
hearing,
which
occurred
three
weeks
ago
with
permission
on
the
court.
mr.
charles
tarter
alright.
mr.
charles
tarter
they
always
do,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
tarter
ever
since
i
can
remember,
if
your
honor
please,
of
course
i
can
remember
back
when
you
were
district
attorney,
but
i
believe
as
a
solicitor.
however,
mr.
bettor
informed
me
that
it
was
during
his
time,
as
far
as
he
can
remember.
now,
as
i
say
it
is,
this
case
was
brought
home
to
me
and
it's
supporters
--
mr.
charles
tarter
defense
lawyers,
judge?
mr.
charles
tarter
defense
lawyers
or
district
attorneys?
mr.
charles
tarter
defense
lawyers
or
solicitors?
mr.
charles
tarter
prosecuting
attorney,
we
have
two
full-time
prosecuting
attorneys
at
the
preliminary
hearing
at
birmingham
now.
as
i've
said,
this
case
was
brought
home
to
me,
the
importance
that
it
was
brought
home
to
me
three
weeks
ago.
my
client
in
this
case,
did
not
have
counsel.
three
weeks
ago,
at
a
preliminary
hearing,
which
was
held
some
times
of
a
point
in
the
trial,
i
was
present,
we
examined
the
witnesses.
we
record
and
transcribe
the
testimony,
only
two
witnesses
appear
against
my
client
in
that
particular
matter,
we
recorded
it.
subsequent
to
that,
nine
months
later,
when
we
got
the
trial
of
the
case,
one
of
the
witnesses
for
the
state
did
not
appear.
he
had
a
record.
he
did
not
appear
to
testify
against
the
defendant.
one
witness
did,
he
had
forgotten
what
he
said
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
we
had
it
transcribed
and
record
it.
he
got
up
and
committed
perjury
on
the
witness
stand,
in
an
effort
to
convict
the
defendants.
this
is
clear,
its
a
matter
of
record,
but
with
the
transcript
of
the
preliminary
hearing,
my
client
was
found
not
guilty,
only
because
of
the
transcript.
without
the
transcript,
he
would
then
in
penitentiary
today,
there's
no
doubt,
no
question
about
it,
whatsoever.
getting
three
experience
lawyers,
in
the
city
of
birmingham,
with
about
60
or
70
years
total
experience,
between
the
3
of
them,
testified
that
in
their
opinion
the
preliminary
hearing
was
a
critical
stage
in
alabama.
the
attorney
--
assistant
attorney
general
who
argued
case
before
the
court
of
appeals
of
alabama,
admitted
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
criminal
--
that
the
preliminary
hearing
in
the
state
of
alabama
is
a
critical
stage
to
the
proceedings.
he's
no
longer
with
the
attorney
general's
office.
getting
on
--
mr.
charles
tarter
the
actual
practice
is
to
allow
the
defendant
to
subpoena
witnesses
and
put
them
on
for
himself.
and
for
the
state
--
the
state
may
put
on
one
or
two
witnesses.
they
may
have
a
list
of
witnesses
that
they
have
subpoenaed.
if
they
don't
put
them
on,
i
do
and
examine
them
and
get
their
statement
down
on
a
type-written
record.
most
every
lawyer
that
i
know
--
this
true
in
many,
many
parts
of
the
countries
that
i've
been.
mr.
charles
tarter
that
i've
been
to.
mr.
charles
tarter
even
--
well,
i
may
not
put
on
my
own
witnesses.
no,
i
probably
don't.
mr.
charles
tarter
well,
he
can
call
him
if
he
wishes
to,
but
i
don't
subpoena
--unless
i
have
an
excellent
case,
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
subpoena
witnesses
--
mr.
charles
tarter
right.
mr.
charles
tarter
it
wouldn't
be
tactically
correct,
that's
right.
i
don't
put
on
my
witnesses,
but
i
do
put
on
their
witnesses
if
they
don't.
but
my
time
is
up
for
the
20
minutes,
but
i
haven't
gotten
to
the
identification
question.
but,
if
you
can
visualize
an
answer
to
your
question,
the
court
in
there,
the
judge
and
the
magistrate
attempts,
when
he
does
not
have
a
lawyer
to
try
and
convince
him
that
he
should
waive
to
the
grand
jury
and
not
examine
the
witnesses.
if
you
can
visualize
a
magistrate
with
a
prosecutor
and
the
witnesses,
and
the
defendant
know
nothing
about
the
law,
whatsoever.
all
he
can
think
of
is
to
get
out
of
jail.
so,
he
see
if
he
go
to
the
grand
jury,
he
gets
out
there
much
quicker.
mr.
charles
tarter
may
it
please
the
court.
to
answer
mr.
chief
justice's
question,
with
regard
to
cross
examination
of
the
eye
witness,
it's
the
first
time
i
ever
had
an
opportunity
to
see
a
man
in
the
witness
stand
that
i
was
not
allowed
to
talk
to
him
anytime
before
he
got
on
witness
stand,
at
the
direction
of
district
attorney.
now
--
mr.
charles
tarter
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
tarter
i
said
that
was
the
first
opportunity
i
ever
had
to
see
the
man
on
the
witness
stand
or
to
talk
to
him
in
any
fashion,
whatsoever
at
the
direction
of
the
district
attorney,
would
not
talk
to
him
beyond
any
circumstances.
and
i
tried
most
vigorous.
mr.
charles
tarter
i
did
cross
examine
him,
but
what
am
i
to
cross
examine
him
with,
if
your
honor
please,
i
had
no
transcript,
i
had
not
prior
testimony,
no
statement.
any
defense
lawyer
it
goes
into
criminal
courtroom
without
a
prior
statement
of
witness,
could
get
on
the
witness
stand
and
my
judgment
is
negligent,
and
my
judgment
is
uncommon
to
examine
a
witness
on
the
witness
stand.
but
i
could
not
do
it,
because
he
did
not
--
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
sir.
unfortunately
that's
true
and
many
times
some
people
are
convicted
and
sentenced
to
jail
as
a
result
of
it.
mr.
charles
tarter
sometimes,
yes
sir.
with
regard
to
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
the
lineup
being
unnecessarily
suggested,
let's
look
at
that
just
a
moment,
about
the
lineup
and
whether
or
not
it
was
unnecessarily
suggested.
this
is
in
the
record,
and
i
hope
that
the
court
will
take
a
careful
look
at
the
appendix
and
at
the
briefs
in
this
particular
case.
on
at
least
six
different
occasions,
prior
to
the
lineup,
and
after
viewing
mug
shots
in
the
sheriff's
office,
the
victims
said
and
i
quote,
“i
don't
believe
i
can
identify
the
people.”
he
told
that
the
sheriff
deputy
is
this.
mr.
charles
tarter
it's
in
the
appendix,
if
your
honor
please,
i
have
it
cited
numerous
time
and
during
the
course
of
my
brief.
here's
the
description
that
he
gave
the
sheriff
deputies,
not
once
but
several
times.
they
were
all
black,
they
were
about
the
same
age,
and
they
were
about
the
same
height.
well,
the
only
thing
they
had
in
common,
was
the
fact
that
they
were
black,
because
they
were
not
the
same
age.
one
was
18,
and
was
28,
a
substantial
difference
in
age.
one
was
six
feet,
two
inches
tall
and
the
other
one
was
five
feet
four
inches
tall.
i
suggest
that
there's
a
substantial
difference
between
six
two
and
five
four.
mr.
charles
tarter
during
the
trial
of
the
case?
no,
sir.
the
case
was
lost
before
we
walk
into
the
courtrooms,
so
i
didn't
put
in
either
one
of
them
on
the
witness
stand.
mr.
charles
tarter
if
your
honor
please,
the
publicity
in
this
case
and
the
fact
that
we're
unable
to
examine
the
eye
witness
in
the
case,
before
getting
into
the
courtroom,
without
any
preparation
whatsoever,
it
just
--
all
we
could
do
was
cross
examine
the
eye
witness
and
that
was
about
it.
we
--
we
could
not
prepare
any
defense
in
any
way,
shape
or
fashion
or
form.
and
as
you
very
well
know,
of
course
it
was
a
heinous
crime.
mr.
charles
tarter
the
defense
was
not
guilty.
one
of
the
defendants,
john
henry
coleman,
i'm
confident
was
not
there
that
night,
the
other
one,
ode
stevens
was
in
fact
there
that
night.
mr.
charles
tarter
he
was
with
his
mother
and
with
his
sister.
mr.
charles
tarter
no,
sir.
i
was
going
on
this
point
and
this
point
from
the
day
that
i
got
into
the
case
to
--
i
was
bound
for
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
and
i
knew
that
that
was
my
defense,
because
two
calling
people
on
in
a
case
like
this,
a
mother
and
a
sister
saying,
“yes,
he
was
at
home
watching
television,”
in
this
case,
would
have
been
to
say
the
least
feeble.
and
i
had
a
preliminary
hearing,
and
had
been
to
preliminary
hearing,
i
feel
confident
it
was
been
substantially
different,
as
it
has
in
many
cases.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
tarter
to
determine
probable
cause.
mr.
charles
tarter
that
is
correct,
that
is
the
primary
--
mr.
charles
tarter
that
is
the
primary
purpose
of
it,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
charles
tarter
what
does
probable
cause
consist
of,
if
your
honor
please,
probable
cause
in
the
motion
to
suppress,
dealing
with
arrest
or
search
and
seizures,
an
extremely
complicated
problem,
and
i'm
sure
your
honor
would
not
say
that
counsel
is
not
necessary
in
a
probable
cause
situation
on
a
motion
to
suppress
in
a
confession
or
in
a
arrest
or
in
a
search
and
seizure.
probable
cause
many
times
consist
of
far
more
than
it
consist
of
jurisdiction
or
problems,
it
consist
of
venue
problems,
it
consist
of
identification
problems,
it
consists
of
confessions
of
illegal
obtained
evidence,
all
of
this
thing
--
mr.
charles
tarter
yes
sir,
of
course
my
client
remains
in
jail,
until
we're
able
to
get
--
mr.
charles
tarter
that
is
correct,
it
could
be,
but
of
course
it
also
possible,
i
suppose
anything
is
possible,
that
the
could
have
dismissed
them,
i
don't
know
what
this
eye
witness
would
have
said
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
ten
days
after
they
were
arrested,
that's
what
i'm
saying.
i'm
saying
that
six
months
to
nine
months
later,
the
eye
witness
said
one
thing,
none
of
us
are
clairvoyant,
so
we
can't
say
what
would
have
happened
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
charles
tarter
i
don't
know
what
did
happen
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
there's
no
way
to
know.
mr.
charles
tarter
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
tarter
the
same
as
--
the
same
as
--
mr.
charles
tarter
that's
true
as
in
other
case,
of
course,
with
this
court
have
decided.
there's
no
other
way,
i
cannot
--
mr.
charles
tarter
the
result
--
mr.
charles
tarter
if
he
was
entitled
to
have
a
lawyer
in
the
preliminary
hearing,
i
assert
that
they
should
be
turned
loose.
mr.
charles
tarter
it's
the
alternative,
only
alternative
i
can
see,
if
your
honor
please,
there's
no
way
to
give
us
a
new
and
fresh
preliminary
hearing.
if
you
could,
i
really
would
rather,
it
would
be
that
way.
i
would
give
anything
in
the
world,
if
this
court
could
give
us
a
new
and
fresh
preliminary
hearing.
but
of
course,
you
cannot
do
that.
mr.
charles
tarter
well,
that
the
testimony
is
now
--
the
eye
witness
is
now
committed,
you
see.
he's
now
been
--
well,
we
all
know
as
practicing
lawyers
that
a
district
attorney
spends
a
substantial
time
with
the
case
like
this
on
an
eye
witness.
now,
i'm
not
saying
that
he
told
him
to
say
this,
but
the
power
of
suggestion
is
a
magnificent
thing.
and,
i'm
saying
that
in
this
particular
case,
this
witness
have
said
numerous
times
that
he
could
not
identify
these
people,
that
he
did
not
believe
that
he
could
identify
him.
he
gave
a
description
totally
opposite
from
that
of
the
defendant's.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
sir.
it's
in
the
record.
i
think,
it's
in
--
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
we
did.
we
offered
--
mr.
charles
tarter
as
best
as
i
can
recall
it
was
--
i
think
he
denied
it.
or
he
admit
it
at
the
motion
to
suppress
and
denied
it
at
the
trial,
as
my
best
judgment.
but,
the
best
example
to
you,
with
regard
to
this
state,
believing
in
the
confidence
of
the
eyewitness.
in
answer
to
your
question
is
believe
in
the
congress
--
they
took
a
boy
who
was
out
there
that
night
and
granted
him
immunity
and
put
him
on
the
witness
stand,
in
order
to
support
the
testimony
of
the
eyewitness,
which
says
to
me
they
didn't
have
confidence
in
the
eye
witnesses
testimony
either,
but
they
put
him
on
there
when
they
had
him
just
as
much
did
the
right,
so
to
speak
on
the
identification,
as
they
did
with
the
petitioners.
mr.
charles
tarter
he
said
that
both
of
them
were
there
and
john
hudge,
another
individual
who
was
in
the
lineup,
ode
stevens
testified
--
ode
stevens,
one
of
the
defendants
testified
at
the
trial
that
john
coleman
was
not
there.
he
testified
that
robert
steel,
the
prosecuting
witness
granted
immunity
was
in
fact
there.
they
were
the
four
that
were
there,
not
john
coleman,
john
coleman
was
there,
ode
stevens
admitted
that
he
was
there.
so,
john
coleman
is
either
--
is
the
innocent
party,
i
appreciate
the
indulgence
of
the
court.
mr.
charles
tarter
that's
correct,
if
your
honor
please,
they
don't
do
it
in
95%
of
the
cases.
mr.
charles
tarter
i
don't
deny
that
they
have
a
right
to
do
it.
once
again
i
say,
they
do
it
in
95%
of
the
cases.
i
assumed
if
this
court
decided
that
they
were
entitled
to
counsel,
they
could
in
fact
reverse
and
go
take
all
the
cases
to
the
grand
jury,
but
if
they
did,
it
would
shock
everyone,
including
me.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
tarter
i
don't
think
so,
if
your
honor
please,
there
was
the
question
brought
up
by
justice
stewart
just
a
moment
ago,
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
pointer
versus
texas
pointed
out
that
if
a
statement
was
made
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
that
it
could
not
be
used
against
him
at
the
trial
without
lawyer,
but
i
suggest
to
you
that
here
is
the
point
that
the
court
has
failed
to
see.
if
a
defendant
without
a
lawyer
makes
a
statement
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
before
the
magistrate
granted,
it's
not
admissible
at
the
trial.
but
what
if
he
said
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
“well,
i
was
at
home
with
my
mama
and
my
sister.”
and
then,
okay
that's
not
admissible,
but
then
let's
say
that,
he
makes
that
statement
at
the
trial
of
the
case
and
the
police
take
the
fruits
of
that
statement
that
he
made
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
the
results
of
the
statement
that
he
made
at
the
preliminary
and
goes
out
to
his
mama
and
his
sister
and
says,
“wait,”
or
the
next
day
or
that
afternoon
and
said,
“was
he
there?
what
was
he
doing,
blah,
blah”
and
a
full
statement
from
both
of
them,
so
they
have
taken
the
fruits
of
what
they
have
said
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
it
would
be
prejudice.
so,
i
can't
see
--
mr.
charles
tarter
the
--
as
i
understand,
the
magistrate
asked
him
if
--
asked
both
of
them
if
they
wish
to
make
a
statement,
asked
both
of
them
if
they
wish
to
testify.
now,
whether
or
not
they
were
advised,
they
did
not
have
to
testify
anything
they
said,
as
a
result
of
it,
it
could
be
used
against
him
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
i
don't
know.
mr.
charles
tarter
i
believe
that
they
did.
mr.
charles
tarter
i
believe
that
they
did,
there's
not
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
i
wasn't
there,
there
wasn't
no
records,
so
i
don't
know.
but
they
may
not
have
testified,
they
may
have
testified,
i
don't
know,
whether
they
did
or
not.
mr.
charles
tarter
just
the
admission
by
the
state
that
there
was
a
preliminary
hearing
--
mr.
charles
tarter
and
that
they
were
bound
over
to
the
grand
jury
--
mr.
charles
tarter
no
transcript
made,
i
don't
know
--
mr.
charles
tarter
judge
robert
w.
gwen,
you
recall
he
used
to
be
in
mr.
--
mr.
charles
tarter
the
petitioners?
mr.
charles
tarter
here's
what
happened
in
that
mr.
chief
justice,
i
attempted
to
subpoena
the
judge
in
the
records
and
the
three
lawyers
to
prove
what
happened
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
the
opinion
as
to
the
criticalness
of
the
preliminary
hearing.
there's
--
some
refused
to
allow
me
to
get
into
it
and
i
was
almost
--
mr.
charles
tarter
refused
to
let
me
go
into
this
question
of
the
lawyer
appointment,
then
the
critical
stage
of
the
preliminary
hearing
--
mr.
charles
tarter
yes
and
judge
gibson
would
not
let
me
go
into
it.
i
simply
proffered
--
mr.
charles
tarter
no,
that's
an
evidentiary
question,
and
i
can't
say
that
that
question
should
be
proffered
before
this
court
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
admissible
or
not
admissible.
but
he
did
allow
me
to
proffer
what
i
would
have
offered,
if
he
would
have
allowed
it.
now,
that's
a
ridiculous
thing,
but
that's
what
happened.
i
just
made
a
statement
in
the
record
that
i
would
have
offered
the
testimony
of
statistics
to
show
that
95%
of
all
criminal
cases
come
to
the
preliminary
hearing,
before
going
to
the
grand
jury.
that
there
was
a
preliminary
hearing
held
and
that
they
were
bound
over
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
to
answer
your
question
in
simple
word,
yes.
mr.
charles
tarter
they
would
--
they
would
not
let
me
go
in
to
--
mr.
charles
tarter
no
i
didn't
subpoena
him,
this
was
all.
mr.
charles
tarter
no,
neither
did
i
have
the
three
lawyers
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
charles
tarter
to
be
honest
with
you,
i
don't
recall.
mr.
charles
tarter
i
don't
recall,
of
your
honor
please,
i
remember
judge
gwen
was
there
earlier
that
morning
when
we're
in
the
motion.
and
judge
gibson
informed
me
in
his
office,
he
would
not
let
me
go
into
it
and
wouldn't
let
me
make
a
statement
the
following
morning
about
this.
now,
whether
or
not
i
did,
i
specifically,
to
say
specifically
that
i
did,
i
can't
recall.
i
made
a
long
statement
in
the
record,
of
what
i
hope
to
prove,
if
it
had
been
allowed.
i
simply
do
not
recall
specifically,
i
know
that
judge
gwen
is
on
the
same
floor,
where
this
was
held.
i
know
that
he
was
there,
the
morning
before,
but
i
do
not
recall
whether
or
not
i
actually,
specifically
made
the
statement.
mr.
charles
tarter
about
the
judge
testifying
or
not
testifying?
mr.
charles
tarter
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
tarter
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
july
24,
1966,
in
the
city
of
birmingham,
alabama
on
a
dimly
lit
highway
in
jefferson
county
of
alabama,
several
black
individuals
attacked
a
white
man
and
his
wife
on
the
side
of
the
road,
while
they
were
fixing
a
flat
on
their
car.
these
black
individuals
fired
a
pistol
twice
into
the
body
of
the
gentleman
fixing
the
car.
a
passing
car
coerced
the
individuals
to
flee
from
the
scene
and
on
september
29,
1969,
approximately
1966
--
i
beg
your
pardon
approximately
2
months
later,
they
were
arrested.
they
were
interrogated.
they
were
placed
in
a
line
up.
they
were
taken
before
a
magistrate
for
a
preliminary
hearing.
they
were
arraigned,
they
were
tried,
they
were
convicted
just
this
case
has
sort
his
way
to
this
court.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
preliminary
hearing
is
a
critical
stage
in
the
proceedings
of
a
criminal
case,
requiring
the
presence
of
counsel.
however,
the
real
case
here,
real
issue
here
if
with
regard
to
a
poor
man
being
a
defendant
in
a
preliminary
hearing.
the
sixth
amendment
says,
“in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
have
the
assistance
of
counsel
for
his
defense.”
and
i
suggest
to
you
there
weren't
not
for
the
fact
that
these
defendants
are
poor,
they
would
not
be
here
today.
the
court
has
interpreted
the
sixth
amendment
to
mean
that
counsel
is
needed
at
the
accusatory
stage,
at
the
interrogation,
at
the
lineup,
at
the
arraignment,
at
the
trial,
at
the
appeal,
at
the
probation
hearing.
but
it
has
excused
and
ignored
the
preliminary
hearing,
which
is
probably
the
most
single,
most
important
phase
of
criminal
procedure.
in
my
county,
these
defendants
could
be
tried
at
the
county
courthouse
without
a
lawyer
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
they
could
walk
three
blocks
down
the
street
and
have
a
lawyer
at
the
preliminary
hearing
at
the
federal
court.
to
me
that
is
not
equal
and
exact
justice.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
tarter
getting
to
it
right
--
in
just
a
moment,
if
your
honor
please
i've
listed
17
reasons
in
my
brief.
the
court
in
the
past
has
refused
to
call
the
preliminary
hearing
critical
because
a
plea
was
not
required,
in
white
versus
maryland
once
again
in
pointer
versus
texas.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
sir.
a
warrant
has
obtained
after
his
arrest.
he
lodged
in
the
city
jail,
warrant
is
obtained
after
his
arrest,
he
had
taken
over
to
the
county
jail.
a
bond
is
set
by
the
sheriff,
with
the
exception
of
a
capital
case.
and
then
he
has
taken
forthwith
within
ten
days
before
magistrate,
usually
within
ten
days,
before
magistrate
and
there
preliminary
hearing
is
held
or
resemblance
of
a
preliminary
hearing
without
a
lawyer.
mr.
charles
tarter
that's
a
very
confusing
case,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
charles
tarter
--
they
called
in
an
arraignment
and
then
the
court
talks
about
a
preliminary
hearing
--
mr.
charles
tarter
it
wasn't
arraigned.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
sir.
this
is
the
preliminary
hearing,
which
after
preliminary
hearing
comes
the
grand
jury
action,
then
comes
the
indictment,
then
comes
the
arraignment.
mr.
charles
tarter
then
comes
the
trial.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes.
mr.
charles
tarter
it's
understandable
however
that
the
hamilton
case
is
confusing,
because
of
the
preliminary
--
being
called
a
preliminary
hearing
and
really
is
not,
it's
an
arraignment,
where
plea
is
required.
our
statute
is
very
similar
to
the
statute
in
the
case
of
pointer
versus
--
in
texas,
in
the
case
of
pointer
versus
texas.
there
the
court
said,
the
preliminary
hearing
is
not
a
critical
stage,
because
a
plea
was
not
required,
almost
a
verbatim
statement
as
within
the
white
case.
however,
the
court
said
and
i
quote
from
their
opinion,
“whether
there
might
be
other
circumstances
making
a
preliminary
hearing,
so
critical
as
a
defendant,
as
to
call
for
an
appointment
of
counsel.”
at
that
stage
we
need
not
decide
on
this
record
and
that
question
we
reserve.
it
is
the
question
which
you
have
decided
in
--
which
you
have
reserved
in
pointer
versus
texas
that
we
raise
here.
to
answer
mr.
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
would
say
the
--
all
for
these
reasons
as
to
why
preliminary
hearing
is
important
and
encompasses
more
than
simply
probably
cause
or
whether
or
not
a
plea
is
required.
one,
it
is
the
first
opportunity
that
the
defendant
has
to
be
adequately
informed
by
an
allegedly
impartial
person
of
that
which
he
is
charged.
two,
it
is
the
first
opportunity
to
be
confronted
by
those
who
will
testify
against
him.
three,
it
is
the
first
opportunity
to
examine
those
who
will
testify
against
him
and
have
their
testimony
reduced
to
writing.
mr.
charles
tarter
all
other
witnesses
produced
at
the
hearing
and
all
of
the
witnesses
subpoenaed
by
the
defendant
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf.
and
any
other
witnesses
that
counsel
can
find
the
subpoena
ought
to
have
present
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
sense
that
--
in
a
federal
court,
obviously
the
reason
why
preliminary
hearings
are
not
held,
numerous
preliminary
hearing
are
not
held,
because
of
the
liberal
discovery
rules
and
in
the
federal
court.
however,
in
the
state
court,
there
practically
no
discovery
rules
whatsoever.
when
a
lawyer
is
appointed,
such
as
i
was
in
this
case.
just
before
the
arraignment,
find
absolutely
nothing
about
the
case,
nothing.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
was
appointed
the
day
before
the
case
was
arraigned
and
this
was
a
case
of
great
publicity.
they
were
out
for
two
months,
before
they
were
arrested.
newspaper
headlines
for
weeks
and
days
and
months,
until
they
were
arrested.
people
were
upset.
money
was
solicited
by
groups
to
help
pay
for
the
hospital
bill
and
these
old
things
of
the
victim's
and
it
was
a
heinous
and
terrible
crime.
but
the
point
is
that
i
had
nothing
--
i
couldn't
even
talk
to
the
witness,
until
the
day
the
motions
were
tried
before
his
honor
judge
gideon,
who
phoned
the
direction
to
the
district
attorney.
mr.
charles
tarter
it
says,
if
your
honor
please,
that
it
is
to
determine
probable
cause
and
to
--
mr.
charles
tarter
to
bind
the
defendant
over
to
the
grand
jury.
as
your
honor,
is
well
aware
of
course
probable
cause
means
more
than
just
a
brief
statement
by
some
individual
that
an
act
occurred
in
a
particular
venue
and
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
tarter
in
hamilton,
the
case
was
in
arraignment
and
not
a
preliminary
hearing,
if
your
honor
please.
it
is
confusing,
i
have
--
mr.
charles
tarter
the
arraignment
comes
after
the
preliminary
hearing
and
subsequent
to
the
indictment.
the
arraignment
is
where
the
indictment
is
read
to
the
defendant
and
a
plea
is
entered
at
that
time.
but
no
lawyer
who
is
ever
tried
a
criminal
case
in
alabama
or
anywhere
else
in
a
state
court,
where
preliminary
hearing
is
offered.
what
they're
testifying
that
is
not
important.
it
is
probably
the
single
most
critical
stage
of
all
the
proceedings.
it
reduces
a
trial
to
a
mere
formality.
mr.
charles
tarter
it
could,
if
your
honor
please.
it
could
do
that,
however
we
have
introduced
into
our
brief
and
into
the
trial
of
the
motion
that
before
his
honor
judge
gibson.
that
95%
of
all
cases
tried
in
jefferson
county
and
--
are
taken
by
way
of
the
preliminary
hearing.
very,
very
few,
as
a
matter
i
can't
even
remember
one,
since
i've
been
practicing
law,
which
is
five
years,
where
the
case
was
taken
directly
to
the
grand
jury
without
going
to
the
preliminary
hearings,
just
a
matter
of
procedure.
mr.
charles
tarter
they
could
do
it,
yes.
they
could
do
it,
but
if
they
did,
of
course
in
populous
county,
such
as
jefferson
county,
they
might
be
there
five
years
before
they
ever
got
to
trial.
if
every
case
had
to
go
before
the
grand
jury
that
upon
which
a
warrant
is
thrown
out
on
a
felony,
it's
just
not
possible.
so,
if
the
preliminary
hearing
weaves
the
cases
out,
so
to
speak,
before
they
get
to
the
grand
jury.
of
course,
there's
17
reasons
listed
in
my
brief,
i
--
of
course
have
collected
manually,
read
the
brief.
there's
really
no
need
in
my
--
just
reading
out
of
my
brief,
the
17
points
that
just
first
came
into
my
mind,
they're
on
page
11
and
page
12,
and
page
13
of
my
brief,
which
list
the
many,
many
reasons
for
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
charles
tarter
discovery
is
the
most
emphasis.
motion
to
suppress
many
times
has
been
very
favorable.
the
--
in
many
cases
have
been
dismissed
in
the
preliminary
hearing,
as
a
result
to
motion
to
suppress.
therefore,
the
man
hasn't
had
to
sit
in
jail,
and
hasn't
had
to
--
have
his
liberty
restrained
over
six
months
or
nine
months
that
it
takes
to
get
to
the
trial
and
to
the
merits
of
the
issue.
not
to
mention
the
practical
aspect
of
it
that
you
have
a
good
motion
to
suppress
then
the
state
will
let
it
pass
for
two
years,
and
then
eventually
it
would
be
dismissed.
but
your
client
and
i
have
several
of
these
as
many
lawyers
do
rather
than
the
case
just
being
dismissed.
but
it
is
the
question
reserved
in
pointers
versus
texas
that
we
applied
this
particular
case
to.
now
--
mr.
charles
tarter
well,
then
he
awaits
the
action
of
the
grand
jury.
then
the
grand
jury
acts
and
an
indictment
is
presented,
then
an
arraignment
is
held.
and
counsel
appointed
if
necessary.
mr.
charles
tarter
and
then
a
plea
is
entered,
and
then
a
trial.
mr.
charles
tarter
well,
that's
possible,
it
is
possible.
mr.
charles
tarter
no,
just
in
indictment.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
it's
possible
of
course,
the
grand
jury
wouldn't
indict
him,
but
i
suggested
that
if
the
grand
jury
would
indict
him,
it
would
be
dismissed
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
charles
tarter
well,
of
course
we
--
anything
is
possible,
i
suppose,
but
several
years
trying
dozen
of
criminal
cases
before
the
preliminary
hearing,
both
of
them
that
are
dismissed
or
simply
dismissed.
mr.
charles
tarter
our
district
attorney
controls
the
grand
jury,
if
your
honor
please,
he's
the
only
one
in
the
grand
jury
room.
mr.
charles
tarter
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
charles
tarter
the
district
attorney
controls
the
grand
jury,
he's
only
one
in
the
grand
jury,
it's
his
witnesses
that
testify
before
the
grand
jury.
so,
i
would
be
shocked
and
amazed
that
if
the
case
were
dismissed
by
the
preliminary
hearing
magistrate
that
the
case
will
be
picked
up
by
the
grand
jury.
mr.
charles
tarter
anywhere
from
30
to
90
days.
mr.
charles
tarter
well,
that's
another
question,
he
is
entitled
to
bail
of
course.
my
client
is
a
--
due
to
the
publicity
case,
had
$20,000.00
bond
set
on
both
of
them
at
the
preliminary
hearing
without
a
lawyer,
they
have
been
sitting
in
jail,
since
july
29th
--
i
mean
since
september
29,
1969.
of
course,
they
couldn't
make
a
$200.00
bond,
but
a
$20,000.00
bond
on
each
of
them.
of
course,
they
had
no
counsel
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
if
they
have
had
counsel
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
this
case
very
well
could
have
been
won,
if
you
read
my
brief
carefully.
mr.
charles
tarter
that's
an
unusual
thing,
justice
black
probably
is
aware
of
this.
what
is
over
75
years
we've
had
a
statute
which
requires
that
the
transcript
be
--
the
testimony
be
transcribed,
recorded
and
certified
to
the
circuit
court,
it
has
never
been
done,
ever.
it
is
completely
ignored,
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do.
mr.
charles
tarter
never
gone
to
the
grand
jury,
and
we
as
defense
lawyers
pay
for
court
reporter
to
go
to
the
preliminary
hearing
and
record
the
testimony
and
use
it
later
on,
in
view
of
the
statute.
their
statute
offered
a
corporal
punishment,
for
his
--
honor,
failing
to
record
and
transcribe
this
testimony,
unfortunately
i
had
never
had
encourage
enough
to
enforce
them.
but
this
is
not
only
true
in
alabama,
it
isn't
true
in
many
other
states,
things
such
as
this
being
ignored.
mr.
charles
tarter
that's
right.
mr.
charles
tarter
if
i
had
been
there,
if
i've
got
appointed
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
i
would
have
paid
for
out
of
my
own
pocket
and
had
one
made
in
this
case,
as
i
did
in
another
case.
now,
i
represent
no
group,
and
i
represent
no
organization.
i
represent
my
client,
period
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
in
this
court.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
because
i
bring
the
court
reporter
and
testify
to
its
validity,
you
see.
it
does
not
have
official
status,
in
the
sense
that
it's
a
part
of
the
court
record.
only
when
i
introduce
an
evidence
and
prove
its
validity
and
accuracy.
but
then
--
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
it
is.
one
of
official
--
mr.
charles
tarter
no,
and
they
try
to
get
my
copy,
once
get
it
done.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
let
me
--
it's
really
ridiculous
and
it's
a
vicious
circle,
so
to
speak,
but
let
me
give
you
a
primary
example
of
a
preliminary
hearing,
which
occurred
three
weeks
ago
with
permission
on
the
court.
mr.
charles
tarter
alright.
mr.
charles
tarter
they
always
do,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
tarter
ever
since
i
can
remember,
if
your
honor
please,
of
course
i
can
remember
back
when
you
were
district
attorney,
but
i
believe
as
a
solicitor.
however,
mr.
bettor
informed
me
that
it
was
during
his
time,
as
far
as
he
can
remember.
now,
as
i
say
it
is,
this
case
was
brought
home
to
me
and
it's
supporters
--
mr.
charles
tarter
defense
lawyers,
judge?
mr.
charles
tarter
defense
lawyers
or
district
attorneys?
mr.
charles
tarter
defense
lawyers
or
solicitors?
mr.
charles
tarter
prosecuting
attorney,
we
have
two
full-time
prosecuting
attorneys
at
the
preliminary
hearing
at
birmingham
now.
as
i've
said,
this
case
was
brought
home
to
me,
the
importance
that
it
was
brought
home
to
me
three
weeks
ago.
my
client
in
this
case,
did
not
have
counsel.
three
weeks
ago,
at
a
preliminary
hearing,
which
was
held
some
times
of
a
point
in
the
trial,
i
was
present,
we
examined
the
witnesses.
we
record
and
transcribe
the
testimony,
only
two
witnesses
appear
against
my
client
in
that
particular
matter,
we
recorded
it.
subsequent
to
that,
nine
months
later,
when
we
got
the
trial
of
the
case,
one
of
the
witnesses
for
the
state
did
not
appear.
he
had
a
record.
he
did
not
appear
to
testify
against
the
defendant.
one
witness
did,
he
had
forgotten
what
he
said
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
we
had
it
transcribed
and
record
it.
he
got
up
and
committed
perjury
on
the
witness
stand,
in
an
effort
to
convict
the
defendants.
this
is
clear,
its
a
matter
of
record,
but
with
the
transcript
of
the
preliminary
hearing,
my
client
was
found
not
guilty,
only
because
of
the
transcript.
without
the
transcript,
he
would
then
in
penitentiary
today,
there's
no
doubt,
no
question
about
it,
whatsoever.
getting
three
experience
lawyers,
in
the
city
of
birmingham,
with
about
60
or
70
years
total
experience,
between
the
3
of
them,
testified
that
in
their
opinion
the
preliminary
hearing
was
a
critical
stage
in
alabama.
the
attorney
--
assistant
attorney
general
who
argued
case
before
the
court
of
appeals
of
alabama,
admitted
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
criminal
--
that
the
preliminary
hearing
in
the
state
of
alabama
is
a
critical
stage
to
the
proceedings.
he's
no
longer
with
the
attorney
general's
office.
getting
on
--
mr.
charles
tarter
the
actual
practice
is
to
allow
the
defendant
to
subpoena
witnesses
and
put
them
on
for
himself.
and
for
the
state
--
the
state
may
put
on
one
or
two
witnesses.
they
may
have
a
list
of
witnesses
that
they
have
subpoenaed.
if
they
don't
put
them
on,
i
do
and
examine
them
and
get
their
statement
down
on
a
type-written
record.
most
every
lawyer
that
i
know
--
this
true
in
many,
many
parts
of
the
countries
that
i've
been.
mr.
charles
tarter
that
i've
been
to.
mr.
charles
tarter
even
--
well,
i
may
not
put
on
my
own
witnesses.
no,
i
probably
don't.
mr.
charles
tarter
well,
he
can
call
him
if
he
wishes
to,
but
i
don't
subpoena
--unless
i
have
an
excellent
case,
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
subpoena
witnesses
--
mr.
charles
tarter
right.
mr.
charles
tarter
it
wouldn't
be
tactically
correct,
that's
right.
i
don't
put
on
my
witnesses,
but
i
do
put
on
their
witnesses
if
they
don't.
but
my
time
is
up
for
the
20
minutes,
but
i
haven't
gotten
to
the
identification
question.
but,
if
you
can
visualize
an
answer
to
your
question,
the
court
in
there,
the
judge
and
the
magistrate
attempts,
when
he
does
not
have
a
lawyer
to
try
and
convince
him
that
he
should
waive
to
the
grand
jury
and
not
examine
the
witnesses.
if
you
can
visualize
a
magistrate
with
a
prosecutor
and
the
witnesses,
and
the
defendant
know
nothing
about
the
law,
whatsoever.
all
he
can
think
of
is
to
get
out
of
jail.
so,
he
see
if
he
go
to
the
grand
jury,
he
gets
out
there
much
quicker.
mr.
charles
tarter
may
it
please
the
court.
to
answer
mr.
chief
justice's
question,
with
regard
to
cross
examination
of
the
eye
witness,
it's
the
first
time
i
ever
had
an
opportunity
to
see
a
man
in
the
witness
stand
that
i
was
not
allowed
to
talk
to
him
anytime
before
he
got
on
witness
stand,
at
the
direction
of
district
attorney.
now
--
mr.
charles
tarter
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
tarter
i
said
that
was
the
first
opportunity
i
ever
had
to
see
the
man
on
the
witness
stand
or
to
talk
to
him
in
any
fashion,
whatsoever
at
the
direction
of
the
district
attorney,
would
not
talk
to
him
beyond
any
circumstances.
and
i
tried
most
vigorous.
mr.
charles
tarter
i
did
cross
examine
him,
but
what
am
i
to
cross
examine
him
with,
if
your
honor
please,
i
had
no
transcript,
i
had
not
prior
testimony,
no
statement.
any
defense
lawyer
it
goes
into
criminal
courtroom
without
a
prior
statement
of
witness,
could
get
on
the
witness
stand
and
my
judgment
is
negligent,
and
my
judgment
is
uncommon
to
examine
a
witness
on
the
witness
stand.
but
i
could
not
do
it,
because
he
did
not
--
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
sir.
unfortunately
that's
true
and
many
times
some
people
are
convicted
and
sentenced
to
jail
as
a
result
of
it.
mr.
charles
tarter
sometimes,
yes
sir.
with
regard
to
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
the
lineup
being
unnecessarily
suggested,
let's
look
at
that
just
a
moment,
about
the
lineup
and
whether
or
not
it
was
unnecessarily
suggested.
this
is
in
the
record,
and
i
hope
that
the
court
will
take
a
careful
look
at
the
appendix
and
at
the
briefs
in
this
particular
case.
on
at
least
six
different
occasions,
prior
to
the
lineup,
and
after
viewing
mug
shots
in
the
sheriff's
office,
the
victims
said
and
i
quote,
“i
don't
believe
i
can
identify
the
people.”
he
told
that
the
sheriff
deputy
is
this.
mr.
charles
tarter
it's
in
the
appendix,
if
your
honor
please,
i
have
it
cited
numerous
time
and
during
the
course
of
my
brief.
here's
the
description
that
he
gave
the
sheriff
deputies,
not
once
but
several
times.
they
were
all
black,
they
were
about
the
same
age,
and
they
were
about
the
same
height.
well,
the
only
thing
they
had
in
common,
was
the
fact
that
they
were
black,
because
they
were
not
the
same
age.
one
was
18,
and
was
28,
a
substantial
difference
in
age.
one
was
six
feet,
two
inches
tall
and
the
other
one
was
five
feet
four
inches
tall.
i
suggest
that
there's
a
substantial
difference
between
six
two
and
five
four.
mr.
charles
tarter
during
the
trial
of
the
case?
no,
sir.
the
case
was
lost
before
we
walk
into
the
courtrooms,
so
i
didn't
put
in
either
one
of
them
on
the
witness
stand.
mr.
charles
tarter
if
your
honor
please,
the
publicity
in
this
case
and
the
fact
that
we're
unable
to
examine
the
eye
witness
in
the
case,
before
getting
into
the
courtroom,
without
any
preparation
whatsoever,
it
just
--
all
we
could
do
was
cross
examine
the
eye
witness
and
that
was
about
it.
we
--
we
could
not
prepare
any
defense
in
any
way,
shape
or
fashion
or
form.
and
as
you
very
well
know,
of
course
it
was
a
heinous
crime.
mr.
charles
tarter
the
defense
was
not
guilty.
one
of
the
defendants,
john
henry
coleman,
i'm
confident
was
not
there
that
night,
the
other
one,
ode
stevens
was
in
fact
there
that
night.
mr.
charles
tarter
he
was
with
his
mother
and
with
his
sister.
mr.
charles
tarter
no,
sir.
i
was
going
on
this
point
and
this
point
from
the
day
that
i
got
into
the
case
to
--
i
was
bound
for
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
and
i
knew
that
that
was
my
defense,
because
two
calling
people
on
in
a
case
like
this,
a
mother
and
a
sister
saying,
“yes,
he
was
at
home
watching
television,”
in
this
case,
would
have
been
to
say
the
least
feeble.
and
i
had
a
preliminary
hearing,
and
had
been
to
preliminary
hearing,
i
feel
confident
it
was
been
substantially
different,
as
it
has
in
many
cases.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
tarter
to
determine
probable
cause.
mr.
charles
tarter
that
is
correct,
that
is
the
primary
--
mr.
charles
tarter
that
is
the
primary
purpose
of
it,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
charles
tarter
what
does
probable
cause
consist
of,
if
your
honor
please,
probable
cause
in
the
motion
to
suppress,
dealing
with
arrest
or
search
and
seizures,
an
extremely
complicated
problem,
and
i'm
sure
your
honor
would
not
say
that
counsel
is
not
necessary
in
a
probable
cause
situation
on
a
motion
to
suppress
in
a
confession
or
in
a
arrest
or
in
a
search
and
seizure.
probable
cause
many
times
consist
of
far
more
than
it
consist
of
jurisdiction
or
problems,
it
consist
of
venue
problems,
it
consist
of
identification
problems,
it
consists
of
confessions
of
illegal
obtained
evidence,
all
of
this
thing
--
mr.
charles
tarter
yes
sir,
of
course
my
client
remains
in
jail,
until
we're
able
to
get
--
mr.
charles
tarter
that
is
correct,
it
could
be,
but
of
course
it
also
possible,
i
suppose
anything
is
possible,
that
the
could
have
dismissed
them,
i
don't
know
what
this
eye
witness
would
have
said
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
ten
days
after
they
were
arrested,
that's
what
i'm
saying.
i'm
saying
that
six
months
to
nine
months
later,
the
eye
witness
said
one
thing,
none
of
us
are
clairvoyant,
so
we
can't
say
what
would
have
happened
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
charles
tarter
i
don't
know
what
did
happen
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
there's
no
way
to
know.
mr.
charles
tarter
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
tarter
the
same
as
--
the
same
as
--
mr.
charles
tarter
that's
true
as
in
other
case,
of
course,
with
this
court
have
decided.
there's
no
other
way,
i
cannot
--
mr.
charles
tarter
the
result
--
mr.
charles
tarter
if
he
was
entitled
to
have
a
lawyer
in
the
preliminary
hearing,
i
assert
that
they
should
be
turned
loose.
mr.
charles
tarter
it's
the
alternative,
only
alternative
i
can
see,
if
your
honor
please,
there's
no
way
to
give
us
a
new
and
fresh
preliminary
hearing.
if
you
could,
i
really
would
rather,
it
would
be
that
way.
i
would
give
anything
in
the
world,
if
this
court
could
give
us
a
new
and
fresh
preliminary
hearing.
but
of
course,
you
cannot
do
that.
mr.
charles
tarter
well,
that
the
testimony
is
now
--
the
eye
witness
is
now
committed,
you
see.
he's
now
been
--
well,
we
all
know
as
practicing
lawyers
that
a
district
attorney
spends
a
substantial
time
with
the
case
like
this
on
an
eye
witness.
now,
i'm
not
saying
that
he
told
him
to
say
this,
but
the
power
of
suggestion
is
a
magnificent
thing.
and,
i'm
saying
that
in
this
particular
case,
this
witness
have
said
numerous
times
that
he
could
not
identify
these
people,
that
he
did
not
believe
that
he
could
identify
him.
he
gave
a
description
totally
opposite
from
that
of
the
defendant's.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
sir.
it's
in
the
record.
i
think,
it's
in
--
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
we
did.
we
offered
--
mr.
charles
tarter
as
best
as
i
can
recall
it
was
--
i
think
he
denied
it.
or
he
admit
it
at
the
motion
to
suppress
and
denied
it
at
the
trial,
as
my
best
judgment.
but,
the
best
example
to
you,
with
regard
to
this
state,
believing
in
the
confidence
of
the
eyewitness.
in
answer
to
your
question
is
believe
in
the
congress
--
they
took
a
boy
who
was
out
there
that
night
and
granted
him
immunity
and
put
him
on
the
witness
stand,
in
order
to
support
the
testimony
of
the
eyewitness,
which
says
to
me
they
didn't
have
confidence
in
the
eye
witnesses
testimony
either,
but
they
put
him
on
there
when
they
had
him
just
as
much
did
the
right,
so
to
speak
on
the
identification,
as
they
did
with
the
petitioners.
mr.
charles
tarter
he
said
that
both
of
them
were
there
and
john
hudge,
another
individual
who
was
in
the
lineup,
ode
stevens
testified
--
ode
stevens,
one
of
the
defendants
testified
at
the
trial
that
john
coleman
was
not
there.
he
testified
that
robert
steel,
the
prosecuting
witness
granted
immunity
was
in
fact
there.
they
were
the
four
that
were
there,
not
john
coleman,
john
coleman
was
there,
ode
stevens
admitted
that
he
was
there.
so,
john
coleman
is
either
--
is
the
innocent
party,
i
appreciate
the
indulgence
of
the
court.
mr.
charles
tarter
that's
correct,
if
your
honor
please,
they
don't
do
it
in
95%
of
the
cases.
mr.
charles
tarter
i
don't
deny
that
they
have
a
right
to
do
it.
once
again
i
say,
they
do
it
in
95%
of
the
cases.
i
assumed
if
this
court
decided
that
they
were
entitled
to
counsel,
they
could
in
fact
reverse
and
go
take
all
the
cases
to
the
grand
jury,
but
if
they
did,
it
would
shock
everyone,
including
me.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
tarter
i
don't
think
so,
if
your
honor
please,
there
was
the
question
brought
up
by
justice
stewart
just
a
moment
ago,
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
pointer
versus
texas
pointed
out
that
if
a
statement
was
made
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
that
it
could
not
be
used
against
him
at
the
trial
without
lawyer,
but
i
suggest
to
you
that
here
is
the
point
that
the
court
has
failed
to
see.
if
a
defendant
without
a
lawyer
makes
a
statement
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
before
the
magistrate
granted,
it's
not
admissible
at
the
trial.
but
what
if
he
said
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
“well,
i
was
at
home
with
my
mama
and
my
sister.”
and
then,
okay
that's
not
admissible,
but
then
let's
say
that,
he
makes
that
statement
at
the
trial
of
the
case
and
the
police
take
the
fruits
of
that
statement
that
he
made
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
the
results
of
the
statement
that
he
made
at
the
preliminary
and
goes
out
to
his
mama
and
his
sister
and
says,
“wait,”
or
the
next
day
or
that
afternoon
and
said,
“was
he
there?
what
was
he
doing,
blah,
blah”
and
a
full
statement
from
both
of
them,
so
they
have
taken
the
fruits
of
what
they
have
said
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
it
would
be
prejudice.
so,
i
can't
see
--
mr.
charles
tarter
the
--
as
i
understand,
the
magistrate
asked
him
if
--
asked
both
of
them
if
they
wish
to
make
a
statement,
asked
both
of
them
if
they
wish
to
testify.
now,
whether
or
not
they
were
advised,
they
did
not
have
to
testify
anything
they
said,
as
a
result
of
it,
it
could
be
used
against
him
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
i
don't
know.
mr.
charles
tarter
i
believe
that
they
did.
mr.
charles
tarter
i
believe
that
they
did,
there's
not
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
i
wasn't
there,
there
wasn't
no
records,
so
i
don't
know.
but
they
may
not
have
testified,
they
may
have
testified,
i
don't
know,
whether
they
did
or
not.
mr.
charles
tarter
just
the
admission
by
the
state
that
there
was
a
preliminary
hearing
--
mr.
charles
tarter
and
that
they
were
bound
over
to
the
grand
jury
--
mr.
charles
tarter
no
transcript
made,
i
don't
know
--
mr.
charles
tarter
judge
robert
w.
gwen,
you
recall
he
used
to
be
in
mr.
--
mr.
charles
tarter
the
petitioners?
mr.
charles
tarter
here's
what
happened
in
that
mr.
chief
justice,
i
attempted
to
subpoena
the
judge
in
the
records
and
the
three
lawyers
to
prove
what
happened
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
the
opinion
as
to
the
criticalness
of
the
preliminary
hearing.
there's
--
some
refused
to
allow
me
to
get
into
it
and
i
was
almost
--
mr.
charles
tarter
refused
to
let
me
go
into
this
question
of
the
lawyer
appointment,
then
the
critical
stage
of
the
preliminary
hearing
--
mr.
charles
tarter
yes
and
judge
gibson
would
not
let
me
go
into
it.
i
simply
proffered
--
mr.
charles
tarter
no,
that's
an
evidentiary
question,
and
i
can't
say
that
that
question
should
be
proffered
before
this
court
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
admissible
or
not
admissible.
but
he
did
allow
me
to
proffer
what
i
would
have
offered,
if
he
would
have
allowed
it.
now,
that's
a
ridiculous
thing,
but
that's
what
happened.
i
just
made
a
statement
in
the
record
that
i
would
have
offered
the
testimony
of
statistics
to
show
that
95%
of
all
criminal
cases
come
to
the
preliminary
hearing,
before
going
to
the
grand
jury.
that
there
was
a
preliminary
hearing
held
and
that
they
were
bound
over
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes.
mr.
charles
tarter
yes,
to
answer
your
question
in
simple
word,
yes.
mr.
charles
tarter
they
would
--
they
would
not
let
me
go
in
to
--
mr.
charles
tarter
no
i
didn't
subpoena
him,
this
was
all.
mr.
charles
tarter
no,
neither
did
i
have
the
three
lawyers
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
charles
tarter
to
be
honest
with
you,
i
don't
recall.
mr.
charles
tarter
i
don't
recall,
of
your
honor
please,
i
remember
judge
gwen
was
there
earlier
that
morning
when
we're
in
the
motion.
and
judge
gibson
informed
me
in
his
office,
he
would
not
let
me
go
into
it
and
wouldn't
let
me
make
a
statement
the
following
morning
about
this.
now,
whether
or
not
i
did,
i
specifically,
to
say
specifically
that
i
did,
i
can't
recall.
i
made
a
long
statement
in
the
record,
of
what
i
hope
to
prove,
if
it
had
been
allowed.
i
simply
do
not
recall
specifically,
i
know
that
judge
gwen
is
on
the
same
floor,
where
this
was
held.
i
know
that
he
was
there,
the
morning
before,
but
i
do
not
recall
whether
or
not
i
actually,
specifically
made
the
statement.
mr.
charles
tarter
about
the
judge
testifying
or
not
testifying?
mr.
charles
tarter
thank
you,
your
honor.
