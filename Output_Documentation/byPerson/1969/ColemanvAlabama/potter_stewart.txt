justice
potter
stewart
you
got
to
tell
us,
i
hope
--
what's
your
argument?
just
what
is
the
function
of
a
preliminary
hearing
in
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
brief
and
what
happens
there?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
--
this
is
not
the
same
minimal.
it
was
before
the
court
in
hamilton
against
alabama?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
an
arraignment.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
was
in
fact
an
arraignment
at
the
indictment,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
after
indictment?
justice
potter
stewart
or
information.
this
is
quite
different
and
this
is
pre
indictment.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
was
the
arraignment
that
was
involved
in
hamilton?
justice
potter
stewart
all
right,
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
what
happens,
i'm
reading
the
sections
of
your
statutes,
on
pages
3
and
4
of
your
brief.
it
talks
about
one
of
the
kind
that
must
be
discharged,
in
section
139,
then
section
140.
it
talks
about
what
happens
if
probably
cause
is
shown.
it
must
be
discharged
on
bail,
if
he
could
make
bail
and
--
but
if
a
sufficient
bail
is
not
give,
he
must
be
committed
to
jail,
then
what
happens?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
of
course
the
grand
jury
might
not
indict
him
too.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
have
any
practice
of
charges
brought
by
information
in
your
study?
justice
potter
stewart
just
indictment.
justice
potter
stewart
well
probably,
but
not
always.
justice
potter
stewart
but
don't
they
--
don't
your
grand
jury
sometimes
ignore
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
mean
opposite.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
tarter,
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
which
is
unfamiliar
in
jurisdiction
rights,
there
the
--
all
the
prosecution
would
do
would
be
to
make
a
prima
facie
case
and
the
magistrate
wouldn't
even
hear
from
the
defense
witnesses.
i
gather
from
your
statute
that
yours
is
quite
different,
because
it
imposes
the
duty
upon
a
magistrate,
section
138
to
examine
all
of
the
witnesses,
having
any
knowledge
of
any
facts
relevant
to
such
investigation,
whether
such
witnesses
or
some
of
them
behalf
of
the
state
or
the
defendant.
but
since,
you've
already
told
as
that
at
least
some
of
these
statutes
are
dead
letters.
i
wonder
what
the
actual
practices
is
in
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
even
your
own
witnesses.
justice
potter
stewart
even
your
own
witnesses
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
its
section
138
says
it's
the
duty
of
the
magistrate
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
no,
it
wouldn't
occur.
justice
potter
stewart
it
wouldn't
be
tactically
very
--
justice
potter
stewart
doesn't
anybody
get
out
on
bail,
except
in
the
big
cities?
justice
potter
stewart
100
--
140,
on
page
of
4
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
is
the
one
that--
justice
potter
stewart
imposes
the
duty
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
large
amounts
bail
payments
--
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
time
of
arraignment?
justice
potter
stewart
where
you
plead
guilty
or
not
guilty?
justice
potter
stewart
or
it
opposed
any
other
defenses.
justice
potter
stewart
an
answer
to
an
indictment
and
then
the
trial
starts
two
minutes
after
that
in
your
state?
justice
potter
stewart
why
was
decided
by
this
court
in
pointer
against
texas,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
where
did
this
lineup
take
place?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
birmingham,
but
where?
justice
potter
stewart
inside?
justice
potter
stewart
four
walls
and
a
roof.
justice
potter
stewart
in
a
room,
inside.
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
--
does
it
show
that
was
the
same
hat
that
he
was
wearing
at
the
time
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
move
his
hat
down,
down
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
and
at
the
time
of
the
offense,
was
he
testified
he
had
it
down
or
up?
justice
potter
stewart
from
where,
where
these
man
brought
into
the
lineup
from
--
from
where
were
they
brought?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
mean
directly,
from
where
--
they
came
into
the
lineup,
this
(voice
overlap)
these
petitioners
came
into
the
lineup
from
where?
from
outside?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
just
--
i'm
interested
in
your
theory
that
this
man
just
had
a
habit
of
wearing
a
hat,
24
hours
a
day,
inside,
outside,
and
i
just
wonder
if
when
they
came
into
the
lineup
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
had
a
hat
on,
where
did
he
come
from
at
that
time?
from
outside
or
from
the
jail?
justice
potter
stewart
your
suggestion
is
he
just
wears
a
hat
all
the
time.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
purpose
of
the
preliminary
hearing,
as
i
understand
it
is
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
there's
probable
cause
to
bring
to
--
probable
cause
to
think
that
an
offense
has
been
committed
and
this
is
the
man
who
committed,--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
just
been
an
adventitious
use
of
--
by
defense
counsel
that
sprung
out
to
take
advantage
of
that
for
their
own
benefit,
it
isn't
designed
really
for
the
purpose
of
later
impeachment
or
discovery
at
the
--
or
particularly
for
the
purposes
of
getting
a
transcript
with
those
witnesses
to
impeach
him
later,
it's
purpose
simply
is
to
--
is
what
i
stated,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
that
an
offense
has
been
committed,
and
if
this
is
the
man
who
has
done
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
so,
then
his
held
for
the
grand
jury
and
march
or
not
bail
for
the
meantime,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
only
purpose.
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
not
understood
your
argument
to
be
that
if
counsel
had
been
there.
there
would
have
been
any
possibility
in
the
world
that
these
man
would
not
have
been
bound
over
to
the
grand
jury,
i'd
understood
your
argument
to
be
that
if
counsel
had
been
there,
he
could
have
arranged
for
a
transcript
of
the
testimony
of
the
victims,
the
complaining
witnesses
to
be
later
at
the
trial
of
these
people,
isn't
that
your
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
don't
know
what
did
happen,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
if
you
prevail
here,
there
cannot
possibly
be
a
retrial
and
another
conviction,
can
it?
because
we
cannot
turn
back
the
clock,
we
cannot
unring
the
bell,
we
cannot
now
provide
counsel
at
that
preliminary
hearing
many
years
ago.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
this
man
--
these
people
have
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
discharge.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
he
identified
both
of
these
petitioners,
as
being
his
colleagues
that
night?
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
you
have
any
--
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
my
question,
how
do
you
have
any
idea
at
all
if
what
did
happened
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
but,
there
was
one.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
no
transcript
made.
