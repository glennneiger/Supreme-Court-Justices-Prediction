mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
mr.
chief
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
my
learned
colleague
indicated,
this
is
really
the
case,
the
united
states
versus
oscar
and
genevieve
carlson
and
not
the
estate
of
donnelly
who
has
been
dead
now
for
some
six
years,
and
who
would
care
less
as
to
what
the
outcome
of
this
matter
is.
but
as
indicated,
the
home
of
the
respondent
carlson
stands
in
jeopardy
of
some
$36,000.00
in
tax
liability
of
the
late
mr.
donnelly
whose
relationship
with
carlson
was
merely
that
of
seller
to
buyer
and
carlson
is
the
admitted
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
1923
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
well,
perhaps
my
learned
colleague
didn't
quite
make
it
clear
is
to
what
the
internal
revenue
code
section
3670
or
as
presently
section
6323
(a)
provided
that
notice
of
the
lien,
in
order
to
be
effective
against
subsequent
purchasers,
mortgagees,
etcetera
would
be
filed
would
be
filed
with
the
local
office
if
the
local
office
had
designated
--
if
the
state
had
designated
such
a
local
office
and
then
provided
that
in
the
event
the
state
had
not
designated
such
a
local
office
then
the
federal
filing
would
be
applicable.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
state
of
michigan
since
august
of
1956,
there
has
not
been
a
federal
filing
because
at
that
time,
michigan
adopted
the
uniform
federal
tax
lien
registration
act
and
brought
itself
into
line
with
the
probably
all
the
other
50
states
with
the
exception
of
the
states
now
that
the
government
contends
has
adopted
a
bad
form,
i
think,
four
states
where
named
by
my
learned
colleague.
but
once
the
state
has
designated
such
a
local
office
for
the
filing
of
a
federal
tax
lien
notice,
then
there
is
no
requirement
of
filing
these
with
the
federal
government
and
the
federal
government
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
well,
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
i
don't
believe
that
obtains
in
most
states
mr.
justice
because
most
states
have
adopted
the
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
this
maybe
so,
but
in
those
states
that
have
a
state
law
designating
the
place
to
file
a
federal
tax
lien
notice,
the
notices
are
filed
in
that
state
office,
and
not
with
the
clerk
of
the
federal
court
which
was
the
problem
of
michigan
--
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
well,
they
are
not
filed
with
the
federal
court.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
well
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
was
correctly
stated
by
my
learned
colleague.
in
1944
as
had
been
indicated,
the
youngblood
case
was
announced
by
the
circuit
court
of
--
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
never
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
even
ask
for
certiorari
of
that
case.
so
from
1944
on,
as
far
as
practitioners
were
concern
in
the
state
of
michigan,
the
youngblood
case
represented
the
highest
interpretation
of
the
validity
of
the
michigan
recording
act
and
the
michigan
recording
act
designated
a
local
office
for
the
filing
of
federal
tax
liens.
now,
this
court
in
its
wisdom
in
the
union
central
case
in
1961,
decided
that
this
particular
michigan
act
was
invalid
as
to
the
facts
involved
in
that
case
because
of
that
one
clause
in
the
michigan
act
which
required
the
government
to
put
a
description
of
land
in
the
notice
that
they
where
filing.
but
until
this
court
made
that
pronouncement
in
the
end
of
1961,
as
far
as
practitioner's
were
concerned
in
the
state
of
michigan,
notwithstanding
a
leonard
law
review
article
and
the
few
other
people
that
may
have
had
some
doubts
about
the
youngblood
case,
the
youngblood
case
was
the
law.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
the
title
opinion
in
this
case
mr.
chief
justice
was
in
either
july
or
august
of
1960.
the
purchase
was
shortly
thereafter
and
the
purchase
was
consummated
approximately
16
months
before
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
union
central
case.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
explain.
in
a
state
that
has
a
version
of
the
uniform
federal
tax
lien
registration
act,
all
these
notices
must
be
filed,
federal
notices
must
be
filed
in
the
local
office.
so,
if
a
state
has
the
uniform
act,
the
title
company
is
not
going
to
go
to
the
federal
office
to
check
for
tax
liens
because
the
liens
aren't
going
to
be
there.
as
i
indicate
since
august
1956
in
michigan,
there
has
not
been
federal
tax
lien
notices
filed
with
the
federal
court.
they
have
all
been
filed
with
the
registers
of
deeds
in
the
counties
because
michigan
at
that
time
went
into
line
with
the
rest
of
the
states
and
adopted
the
uniform
recording
act.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
because
the
title
company
would
be
justified
in
relying
on
the
records
of
the
registered
deeds
office
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
the
exception
said
that
this
abstract
of
title
does
not
--
excuse
me,
this
abstract
of
title
covers,
matters
on
file
in
the
office
of
the
register
of
deeds
for
livingston
county,
michigan.
it
does
not
contain
matters
of
record
in
the
circuit
federal
or
probate
courts.
if
an
examination
of
these
matters
is
required
an
extra
charge
will
be
made
or
words
to
that
effect.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
no.
it
just
said
federal
courts
--
the
state
circuit
courts
and
probate
courts.
in
other
words,
it
didn't
single
out
the
federal
tax
liens
as
a
something
to
disregard
i'll
say.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
that
is
correct.
in
other
words,
if
a
judgment
was
entered
in
the
circuit
court
which
may
have
affected
land
unless
the
parties
to
that
suit
saw
that
their
judgment
was
filed
with
the
register
of
deeds,
then
the
abstract
company
wasn't
going
to
pick
it
up.
in
an
affect
under
michigan
law,
there'd
be
a
question
whether
bfp
would
be
affected
by
such
judgment
without
that
recording.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
ah,
the
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
i
believe,
it
is
in
the
appendix,
i
believe
mr.
justice
stewart.
but
i
believe,
it's
in
the
argument
portion,
the
abstract
itself
was
not
appended
to
the
record
in
the
lower
court
and
it's
not
part
of
--
it's
not
an
exhibit
in
this
particular
matter.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
but
i
believe
that
it
was
read
to
the
trial
court
during
argument
and
it
would
appear
in
the
appendix
under
the
record
of
the
decision
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
yes.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
i
believe
so.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
yes,
that
appears
that
way.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
yes,
in
the
colloquy
between
counsel
and
the
court,
yes
sir.
my
learned
colleague
also
has
ignored
the
fact
that
in
the
spring
of
1961,
which
was
approximately
eight
months
after
the
carlsons
bought
the
property
in
livingston
county.
the
government
filed
notices
of
tax
lien
with
the
register
of
deeds
in
livingston
county
and
the
register
of
deeds
in
genesee
county,
michigan.
now,
the
late
mr.
donnelly
was
a
resident
of
wayne
county
and
it's
admitted
that
in
1950
when
the
day
before
the
federal
tax
lien
notice
was
filed
with
the
federal
court,
a
filing
was
made
and
accepted
by
the
wayne
county,
michigan,
register
of
deeds,
the
county
in
which
donnelly
resided.
the
filings
in
1961,
eight
months
after
the
carlsons'
purchase
were
eight
months
before
the
union
central
case.
now,
the
government
says
that
these
filings
don't
mean
anything,
that
they're
superfluous,
but
the
question
here
involves
the
whether
this
court
should
consider
the
union
central
case
to
be
prospective
or
retroactive
and
if
the
government
was
confused
as
to
its
responsibility
of
filing
notices
with
the
register
of
deeds
then
mr.
carlson
certainly
have
no
more
knowledge
than
the
government
of
what
this
court
would
do
months
later
in
the
union
central
case.
the
government
filed
locally
if
there
was
no
requirement
or
if
it
didn't
feel
that
it
had
a
requirement
of
filing
locally,
it
could
have
relied.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
the
union
central
was
in
december
of
1961.
this
property
was
purchased
in
august
of
1960.
about
half
way
between
the
time
of
purchase
and
the
time
of
the
union
central
decision,
the
government
took
a
notice
of
lien
and
filed
it
in
livingston
county,
the
very
same
county
where
this
property
is
located,
but
it
was
months
after
carlson
bought
the
property.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
no.
it
was
the
same
lien
mr.
justice,
the
same
lien
against
donnelly
from
1950.
they
just
took
the
notice
out
to
that
county.
now
in
practice,
if
a
man
lives
in
a
county,
the
state
has
a
valid
reporting
law
and
they
will
normally
file
that
lien
in
the
county
of
residence.
but
if
the
internal
revenue
service
becomes
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
man
has
property
in
another
county,
they
will
take
a
similar
notice
to
that
other
county
and
file
at
the
register
of
deeds.
well
they
became
aware
in
1961
that
mr.
donnelly
may
have
had
property
in
livingston
county,
they
filed
a
notice
of
that
time,
but
that
filing
didn't
help
the
carlsons
because
they
have
purchase
the
property
and
paid
the
money
and
that
was
it.
but
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
well,
it
didn't
help
the
government,
but
it
showed
that
the
government
was
no
--
had
no
greater
idea
of
what
the
end
result
of
this
confusion
of
michigan
law,
because
of
perhaps
the
youngblood
case,
then
the
carlsons
had.
the
carlsons
and
their
attorneys
relied
on
an
abstract,
this
was
a
pre
exception.
it
was
not
something
that
the
abstract
company
single
out
for
the
carlsons.
this
exception
appeared
in
each
and
every
page
of
every
abstract
issued
by
this
livingston
county
office.
now,
the
michigan
statute
that
this
court
construed
in
the
union
central
case
was
on
the
books
in
the
state
of
michigan
for
approximately
36
years
before
it
was
repealed
in
1956.
at
the
time
of
the
union
central
case,
the
michigan
statute
had
been
in
the
books
almost
40
years.
the
youngblood
case
was
the
highest
pronouncement
of
law
at
that
time,
the
time
that
carlsons'
purchase.
and
as
the
trial
court
and
as
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
believed
the
statute,
the
michigan
statute,
had
every
appearance
of
being
upheld.
this
court
had
a
situation
before
it
in
the
union
central
case
where
the
--
in
1953,
the
michigan
attorney
general
rendered
an
opinion
saying
that
from
that
time
on,
the
register
of
deeds
couldn't
take
federal
notices
without
a
legal
description.
and
in
the
union
central
case,
it
says
from
the
time
of
that
opinion
until
1956,
which
was
the
repeal
date
of
that
michigan
statute,
it
was
construed
by
this
court,
the
register
of
deeds
would
not
accept
federal
tax
lien
noticed.
and
the
trial
court,
and
we
concur,
found
that
this
court
made
its
interpretation
of
the
1923
michigan
statute
in
light
of
the
facts
which
existed
between
1953
and
1956.
and
that
this
court
did
not
intend
in
the
union
central
case
to
go
back
30
years
and
strike
out
the
entire
series
of
transactions
and
filings
in
michigan
for
a
30-year
period.
at
the
very
most,
this
court
talked
about
a
three-year
period.
the
carlsons'
purchase
--
the
lien
in
this
matter
was
filed
in
1950
at
the
time
before
the
facts
which
were
referred
to
in
union
central
occurred
and
the
trial
court
distinguished
this
case
from
the
union
central
case.
but
the
trial
court
went
on
further
with
the
decision
in
the
chicot
county
case
and
the
other
decisions
of
this
case
indicating
that
where
vested
rights
are
involved
that
this
court
may,
in
those
circumstances,
determine
that
the
--
it's
decisions
will
be
prospective
rather
than
retrospective
as
to
the
effects
of
transactions
which
occurred
before
the
decision
of
this
court.
now,
i
grant
you
the
government
argues
in
this
case
that
the
chicot
case
and
the
rockaway
new
supply
company
case
and
the
linkletter
case,
all
dealt
with
other
areas.
but
the
premise
is
there
and
that
if
rights
become
vested
that
this
court
has
a
right
to
make
such
a
determination
that
these
rights
shall
not
be
affected
by
a
decision,
and
these
decisions
should
not
be
retroactive
where
the
affect
would
be
such
as
it
is
in
this
carlson
case.
the
government
is
well
able
to
protect
itself
in
tax
lien
matters
and
has
shown
the
ability
to
protect
itself.
this
court
should
keep
in
mind
in
deciding
whether
to
make
the
union
central
case
retrospective
as
far
as
the
carlsons
are
concerned,
the
fact
that
the
tax
liens
where
filed
in
1950,
the
foreclosure
was
not
filed
until
december
30,
1966,
almost
four
years
after
donnelly
died
during
which
time
the
assets
of
donnelly,
if
he
had
any
could
of
have
dissipated.
and
16
years,
almost
17
years,
after
the
tax
lien
notices
where
filed
during
which
time,
they
were
two
extensions
of
donnelly's
liability,
one
extension
which
we
don't
admit
that
validity
of
was
signed
after
donnelly
sold
this
property
to
the
carlsons.
so
in
other
words,
donnelly
in
1961
signed
an
extension
agreement
with
the
government
continuing
that
liability
for
another
fiver
years
and
he
didn't
own
the
property
anymore.
now,
this
issue
was
not
litigated
in
lower
court,
but
it
shows
the
equities
of
the
situation
in
this
matter
and
the
equities
are
basically
what
the
trial
court
in
the
court
of
appeals
felt
should
be
considered
in
whether
or
not
this
court
should
be
retrospective
or
prospective.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
well
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
not
defend
the
same
position
of
the
man
who
after
union
central,
it
becomes
a
law
of
the
land,
would
go
ahead
and
buy
piece
of
property
without
inquiring
it
to
the
question
of
whether
the
notice
was
property
recorded.
as
far
the
union
central
is
the
law
of
the
land,
as
far
as
that
is
concerned,
we're
not
taking
the
position
that
there
can
be
any
argument
at
that
point.
this
is
exactly
the
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
in
regard
to
this
scare
tactic
that
i
feel
the
government
has
used
here.
i'm
talking
about
the
affect
on
40,000
titles
in
four
other
states
other
than
the
state
of
michigan.
each
of
the
statutes
involved
in
that
situation
was
adopted
after
the
union
central
case.
so
if
property
purchasers,
lawyers,
title
examiners,
etcetera,
in
the
four
states
concern,
went
to
determine
the
relative
effects
of
their
statutes,
they
have
union
central
to
look
at.
they
don't
have
a
case
on
the
books
for
15
years
that
says
just
the
opposite
of
the
union
central,
which
was
the
case
in
michigan
with
the
youngblood,
that
on
appeal
from
the
decision
of
the
second
highest
court,
deciding
that
the
michigan
had
a
valid
statute.
illinois,
wisconsin,
pennsylvania,
these
are
post
union
central
statutes
and
i
say
that
the
people
in
those
states
should
let
the
chips
fall
where
they
may,
but
the
government
shouldn't
use
this
decision
as
a
way
of
litigating
the
validity
of
the
statutes
in
these
four
states.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
not
all
of
them
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
i
cannot
answer
that
truthfully.
i
do
not
know
that
this
issue
was
raised
in
that
case
mr.
justice.
i
--
the
union
central
seemed
to
be
rather
unique
case
at
the
time.
michigan
is
the
only
state
that
had
that
particular
section
at
the
time.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
i
don't
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
i
don't
believe
that
the
issue
was
raised.
i
believe
that
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
here
has
the
question
before
of
the
situation
that
occurred
before
this
court's
decision
and
whether
this
court's
decision
should
be
made
retroactive
or
not.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
yes,
mr.
justice?
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
the
carlsons
will
be
faced
with
a
$36,000.00
foreclosure.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
that
is
right.
now,
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
yes.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
this
would
be
correct
mr.
justice.
i
misspoke
myself.
but,
we
have
among
other
things
that
we
--
mr.
justice,
we
contest
some
of
the
factual
allegations
such
as
the
signing
of
extensions.
we
don't
know
whether
the
amount
shown
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
there
are
factual
issues.
this
was
up
on
summary
judgment
before
the
district
court,
mr.
justice.
we
do
have
the
issue
that
i
mentioned
as
to
the
validity
of
the
signing
of
an
extension
after
the
property
is
sold
by
the
taxpayer.0
there's
been
no
precedent
on
this
in
the
--
by
this
court
or
for
that
matter
by
any
other
court
that
i
can
find
and
the
issue
was
not
litigated
before
and
would
have
to
be
litigated.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
that
is
right
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
that
is
correct,
but
the
time
sequence
would
indicate
that
the
michigan
decision
was
after
the
carlsons'
purchase
and
it
came
to
this
court
after
the
carlsons'
purchase.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
no.
the
--
in
the
state
of
michigan,
only
at
that
time,
only
the
supreme
court
decisions
were
printed.
i
cannot
say
when
the
circuit
court
litigation
which
was
involved
initially
in
the
union
central
case
was
actually
filed.
but
my
recollection
is
that
it
was
brought
before
the
michigan
supreme
court
for
a
decision
which
became
known
to
the
public
in
1961
and
when
the
michigan
court
ruled
against
the
government,
certiorari
was
granted
by
this
court
and
case
heard
also
that
year,
all
of
these
events
were
after
the
carlsons'
purchase.
there
was
no
knowledge
in
their
part
or
for
that
matter
by
the
bar
in
general
that
this
issue
was
going
to
be
litigated
by
this
court
in
1961.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
only
by
word
of
mouth
mr.
justice.
as
i
say
at
that
time,
the
only
michigan
decisions
that
were
printed
were
the
supreme
court.
now,
there
is
a
intermediate
appeals
court
in
michigan
where
they
have
printed
decisions,
they
did
not
have
that
court
at
that
time.
so
the
michigan
supreme
court
decision
was
printed
in
1961
which
was
again
as
i
say,
after
the
carlsons'
purchase.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
i
believe
it
was
decided
in
1961
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
that
was
decided
in
december
of
1961,
and
i
believe
that
the
michigan
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
the
michigan
court
if
i
recall,
was
in
the
early
part
of
1961.
it
was
after
the
carlsons'
purchase,
that
i'm
sure
of.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
right.
oh,
60?
than
i
stand
corrected,
except
that
it
was
again,
about
six
weeks
after
the
carlsons'
purchase.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
this
is
true.
as
a
circuit
court
in
another
county
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
not
in
--
no.
the
district
court
was
not
involved.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
at
that
time,
there
was
the
circuit
court
and
an
appeal
directly
to
the
state
supreme
court,
and
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court
was
not
generally
made
public,
unless
somebody
happen
to
be
familiar
with
it
or
come
across
it
in
the
newspaper.
we
have
not
discussed
today,
the
issue
that
we
have
raised
here
in
regard
to
the
necessity
of
recording
a
tax
lien
notice,
when
after
acquired
property
is
involved.
now,
this
matter
is
covered
in
our
brief.
we
feel
that
is
an
issue
that
is
never
been
passed
upon
by
this
court
and
this
is
that
the
entireties
property
which
was
acquired
by
donnelly
and
his
wife
in
1949,
was
not
donnelly's,
or
for
that
matter
was
not
donnelly's
for
the
tax
lien
notice
to
attach
to
until
1960
when
mrs.
donnelly
died
and
the
property
at
that
time
became
that
of
donnelly.
and
we
cited
in
our
brief,
the
hutchinson
case
as
well
as
the
nathanson
case,
and
the
american
national
bank
case
dealing
with
law
similar
to
michigan
or
the
nathanson
case,
the
michigan
law,
all
of
which
says
that
in
an
estate
by
the
entireties,
neither
the
husband
or
the
wife
individually
own
an
interest
in
a
piece
of
--
in
the
entireties
property
which
is
capable
of
standing
alone
of
being
levied
upon
for
the
tax
liability
of
one
spouse.
the
hutchinson
case
by
the
court
of
appeals,
as
well
as
the
american
national
bank
case,
both
indicate
that
the
federal
tax
lien
does
not
attach
to
entireties
property
until
the
death
of
one
of
the
spouses.
it
is
our
position
that
a
clear
reading
of
the
internal
revenue
code
recording
provisions
would
require
the
filing
of
a
notice
as
against
after
acquired
property
in
a
state
where
such
a
notice
had
not
been
previously
filed
at
the
time
such
property
is
acquired
by
the
taxpayer.
now,
the
glass
city
bank
case
is
my
learned
colleague
indicated,
says
that
a
tax
lien
attaches
to
after
acquired
property.
but
there
is
a
void
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned,
as
to
what
the
government
must
do
to
perfect
that
tax
lien
against
such
after
acquired
property.
the
lien
is
a
legal
status.
the
notice
of
that
lien
is
a
notice
to
the
world
which
perfects
that
lien
as
against
intervening
third
parties.
and
in
this
situation,
the
government
has
said
in
affect
that
if
union
central
applies
to
the
federal
filing
of
the
notice
in
this
case,
the
1950,
that
that
notice
in
1950
is
good
in
perpetuity
to
all
notices
filed
in
the
federal
court
on
forever
until
those
liens
are
no
longer
enforceable.
we
feel
that
this
is
not
the
law
and
it
is
not
the
intent
of
the
law.
the
internal
revenue
code
says,
that
notice
shall
be
filed
whenever
the
state
has
designated
a
state
office
and
the
word
whenever
means
at
such
time
as
and
i
don't
think
that
the
internal
revenue
code
has
to
be
construed
to
mean
that
a
notice
filed
in
the
federal
court
is
good
forever.
i'm
not
saying
that
it
affects
liens
that
were
existence
against
property,
in
the
existence
when
the
lien
was
filed.
but
if
the
state
adopts
a
valid
state
recording
law,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
government
must
at
that
time
go
an
comply
with
that
state
law
as
to
property
which
comes
into
existence
after
that
state
law
is
adopted.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
yes.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
mr.
chief
justice
as
i
said
before.
this
exception
was
not
something
that
they
typed
in
just
for
mr.
carlson.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
for
everybody.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
on
hindsight.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
on
hindsight
mr.
chief
justice.
in
other
words,
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
well
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
well
mr.
chief
justice
and
again,
this
is
from
my
own
knowledge
and
whether
i
can
say
this
to
be
considered
by
this
court,
i
will
say
that
as
of
1970,
the
abstract
companies
in
michigan
used
that
same
exception.
the
difference
being
that
now,
they
aren't
tax
liens
filed
in
the
federal
court
anyway
and
the
exception
doesn't
mean
anything.
but
if
for
some
reason,
this
court
in
some
other
situation,
a
year
from
now,
determined
that
the
present
michigan
law
was
invalid
then
we
have
the
same
problem
all
over
again.
in
other
words,
they
have
that
in
there
because
they
don't
look
at
the
federal
court
and
they
didn't
look
at
the
federal
court
recordings
of
1960
at
this
transaction
because
it
was
assumed
for
almost
40
years
that
they
didn't
file
tax
liens
in
michigan
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
if
they
did
not
indicate
that
a
separate
request
would
have
to
be
made
for
federal
court
lien,
it
very
well
could
be,
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
i
would
say
that
may
have
been,
but
at
the
time,
they
would
have
been
a
question
whether
or
not
the
even
the
entry
of
a
federal
recording
would
have
been
anything
except
actual
notice
as
opposed
to
constructive
notice
until
the
union
central
case
was
handed
down.
the
federal
filing
may
not
have
been
a
valid
filing,
even
if
it
was
there.
and
i
believe
that
there
is
a
void
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
law
as
to
whether
actual
notice
stands
in
the
place
of
constructive
notice
in
regard
to
the
federal
tax
lien
notice
filings.
that,
i
don't
think
is
been
clearly
raised.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
mr.
chief
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
my
learned
colleague
indicated,
this
is
really
the
case,
the
united
states
versus
oscar
and
genevieve
carlson
and
not
the
estate
of
donnelly
who
has
been
dead
now
for
some
six
years,
and
who
would
care
less
as
to
what
the
outcome
of
this
matter
is.
but
as
indicated,
the
home
of
the
respondent
carlson
stands
in
jeopardy
of
some
$36,000.00
in
tax
liability
of
the
late
mr.
donnelly
whose
relationship
with
carlson
was
merely
that
of
seller
to
buyer
and
carlson
is
the
admitted
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
1923
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
well,
perhaps
my
learned
colleague
didn't
quite
make
it
clear
is
to
what
the
internal
revenue
code
section
3670
or
as
presently
section
6323
(a)
provided
that
notice
of
the
lien,
in
order
to
be
effective
against
subsequent
purchasers,
mortgagees,
etcetera
would
be
filed
would
be
filed
with
the
local
office
if
the
local
office
had
designated
--
if
the
state
had
designated
such
a
local
office
and
then
provided
that
in
the
event
the
state
had
not
designated
such
a
local
office
then
the
federal
filing
would
be
applicable.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
state
of
michigan
since
august
of
1956,
there
has
not
been
a
federal
filing
because
at
that
time,
michigan
adopted
the
uniform
federal
tax
lien
registration
act
and
brought
itself
into
line
with
the
probably
all
the
other
50
states
with
the
exception
of
the
states
now
that
the
government
contends
has
adopted
a
bad
form,
i
think,
four
states
where
named
by
my
learned
colleague.
but
once
the
state
has
designated
such
a
local
office
for
the
filing
of
a
federal
tax
lien
notice,
then
there
is
no
requirement
of
filing
these
with
the
federal
government
and
the
federal
government
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
well,
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
i
don't
believe
that
obtains
in
most
states
mr.
justice
because
most
states
have
adopted
the
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
this
maybe
so,
but
in
those
states
that
have
a
state
law
designating
the
place
to
file
a
federal
tax
lien
notice,
the
notices
are
filed
in
that
state
office,
and
not
with
the
clerk
of
the
federal
court
which
was
the
problem
of
michigan
--
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
well,
they
are
not
filed
with
the
federal
court.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
well
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
was
correctly
stated
by
my
learned
colleague.
in
1944
as
had
been
indicated,
the
youngblood
case
was
announced
by
the
circuit
court
of
--
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
never
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
even
ask
for
certiorari
of
that
case.
so
from
1944
on,
as
far
as
practitioners
were
concern
in
the
state
of
michigan,
the
youngblood
case
represented
the
highest
interpretation
of
the
validity
of
the
michigan
recording
act
and
the
michigan
recording
act
designated
a
local
office
for
the
filing
of
federal
tax
liens.
now,
this
court
in
its
wisdom
in
the
union
central
case
in
1961,
decided
that
this
particular
michigan
act
was
invalid
as
to
the
facts
involved
in
that
case
because
of
that
one
clause
in
the
michigan
act
which
required
the
government
to
put
a
description
of
land
in
the
notice
that
they
where
filing.
but
until
this
court
made
that
pronouncement
in
the
end
of
1961,
as
far
as
practitioner's
were
concerned
in
the
state
of
michigan,
notwithstanding
a
leonard
law
review
article
and
the
few
other
people
that
may
have
had
some
doubts
about
the
youngblood
case,
the
youngblood
case
was
the
law.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
the
title
opinion
in
this
case
mr.
chief
justice
was
in
either
july
or
august
of
1960.
the
purchase
was
shortly
thereafter
and
the
purchase
was
consummated
approximately
16
months
before
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
union
central
case.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
explain.
in
a
state
that
has
a
version
of
the
uniform
federal
tax
lien
registration
act,
all
these
notices
must
be
filed,
federal
notices
must
be
filed
in
the
local
office.
so,
if
a
state
has
the
uniform
act,
the
title
company
is
not
going
to
go
to
the
federal
office
to
check
for
tax
liens
because
the
liens
aren't
going
to
be
there.
as
i
indicate
since
august
1956
in
michigan,
there
has
not
been
federal
tax
lien
notices
filed
with
the
federal
court.
they
have
all
been
filed
with
the
registers
of
deeds
in
the
counties
because
michigan
at
that
time
went
into
line
with
the
rest
of
the
states
and
adopted
the
uniform
recording
act.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
because
the
title
company
would
be
justified
in
relying
on
the
records
of
the
registered
deeds
office
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
the
exception
said
that
this
abstract
of
title
does
not
--
excuse
me,
this
abstract
of
title
covers,
matters
on
file
in
the
office
of
the
register
of
deeds
for
livingston
county,
michigan.
it
does
not
contain
matters
of
record
in
the
circuit
federal
or
probate
courts.
if
an
examination
of
these
matters
is
required
an
extra
charge
will
be
made
or
words
to
that
effect.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
no.
it
just
said
federal
courts
--
the
state
circuit
courts
and
probate
courts.
in
other
words,
it
didn't
single
out
the
federal
tax
liens
as
a
something
to
disregard
i'll
say.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
that
is
correct.
in
other
words,
if
a
judgment
was
entered
in
the
circuit
court
which
may
have
affected
land
unless
the
parties
to
that
suit
saw
that
their
judgment
was
filed
with
the
register
of
deeds,
then
the
abstract
company
wasn't
going
to
pick
it
up.
in
an
affect
under
michigan
law,
there'd
be
a
question
whether
bfp
would
be
affected
by
such
judgment
without
that
recording.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
ah,
the
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
i
believe,
it
is
in
the
appendix,
i
believe
mr.
justice
stewart.
but
i
believe,
it's
in
the
argument
portion,
the
abstract
itself
was
not
appended
to
the
record
in
the
lower
court
and
it's
not
part
of
--
it's
not
an
exhibit
in
this
particular
matter.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
but
i
believe
that
it
was
read
to
the
trial
court
during
argument
and
it
would
appear
in
the
appendix
under
the
record
of
the
decision
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
yes.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
i
believe
so.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
yes,
that
appears
that
way.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
yes,
in
the
colloquy
between
counsel
and
the
court,
yes
sir.
my
learned
colleague
also
has
ignored
the
fact
that
in
the
spring
of
1961,
which
was
approximately
eight
months
after
the
carlsons
bought
the
property
in
livingston
county.
the
government
filed
notices
of
tax
lien
with
the
register
of
deeds
in
livingston
county
and
the
register
of
deeds
in
genesee
county,
michigan.
now,
the
late
mr.
donnelly
was
a
resident
of
wayne
county
and
it's
admitted
that
in
1950
when
the
day
before
the
federal
tax
lien
notice
was
filed
with
the
federal
court,
a
filing
was
made
and
accepted
by
the
wayne
county,
michigan,
register
of
deeds,
the
county
in
which
donnelly
resided.
the
filings
in
1961,
eight
months
after
the
carlsons'
purchase
were
eight
months
before
the
union
central
case.
now,
the
government
says
that
these
filings
don't
mean
anything,
that
they're
superfluous,
but
the
question
here
involves
the
whether
this
court
should
consider
the
union
central
case
to
be
prospective
or
retroactive
and
if
the
government
was
confused
as
to
its
responsibility
of
filing
notices
with
the
register
of
deeds
then
mr.
carlson
certainly
have
no
more
knowledge
than
the
government
of
what
this
court
would
do
months
later
in
the
union
central
case.
the
government
filed
locally
if
there
was
no
requirement
or
if
it
didn't
feel
that
it
had
a
requirement
of
filing
locally,
it
could
have
relied.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
the
union
central
was
in
december
of
1961.
this
property
was
purchased
in
august
of
1960.
about
half
way
between
the
time
of
purchase
and
the
time
of
the
union
central
decision,
the
government
took
a
notice
of
lien
and
filed
it
in
livingston
county,
the
very
same
county
where
this
property
is
located,
but
it
was
months
after
carlson
bought
the
property.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
no.
it
was
the
same
lien
mr.
justice,
the
same
lien
against
donnelly
from
1950.
they
just
took
the
notice
out
to
that
county.
now
in
practice,
if
a
man
lives
in
a
county,
the
state
has
a
valid
reporting
law
and
they
will
normally
file
that
lien
in
the
county
of
residence.
but
if
the
internal
revenue
service
becomes
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
man
has
property
in
another
county,
they
will
take
a
similar
notice
to
that
other
county
and
file
at
the
register
of
deeds.
well
they
became
aware
in
1961
that
mr.
donnelly
may
have
had
property
in
livingston
county,
they
filed
a
notice
of
that
time,
but
that
filing
didn't
help
the
carlsons
because
they
have
purchase
the
property
and
paid
the
money
and
that
was
it.
but
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
well,
it
didn't
help
the
government,
but
it
showed
that
the
government
was
no
--
had
no
greater
idea
of
what
the
end
result
of
this
confusion
of
michigan
law,
because
of
perhaps
the
youngblood
case,
then
the
carlsons
had.
the
carlsons
and
their
attorneys
relied
on
an
abstract,
this
was
a
pre
exception.
it
was
not
something
that
the
abstract
company
single
out
for
the
carlsons.
this
exception
appeared
in
each
and
every
page
of
every
abstract
issued
by
this
livingston
county
office.
now,
the
michigan
statute
that
this
court
construed
in
the
union
central
case
was
on
the
books
in
the
state
of
michigan
for
approximately
36
years
before
it
was
repealed
in
1956.
at
the
time
of
the
union
central
case,
the
michigan
statute
had
been
in
the
books
almost
40
years.
the
youngblood
case
was
the
highest
pronouncement
of
law
at
that
time,
the
time
that
carlsons'
purchase.
and
as
the
trial
court
and
as
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
believed
the
statute,
the
michigan
statute,
had
every
appearance
of
being
upheld.
this
court
had
a
situation
before
it
in
the
union
central
case
where
the
--
in
1953,
the
michigan
attorney
general
rendered
an
opinion
saying
that
from
that
time
on,
the
register
of
deeds
couldn't
take
federal
notices
without
a
legal
description.
and
in
the
union
central
case,
it
says
from
the
time
of
that
opinion
until
1956,
which
was
the
repeal
date
of
that
michigan
statute,
it
was
construed
by
this
court,
the
register
of
deeds
would
not
accept
federal
tax
lien
noticed.
and
the
trial
court,
and
we
concur,
found
that
this
court
made
its
interpretation
of
the
1923
michigan
statute
in
light
of
the
facts
which
existed
between
1953
and
1956.
and
that
this
court
did
not
intend
in
the
union
central
case
to
go
back
30
years
and
strike
out
the
entire
series
of
transactions
and
filings
in
michigan
for
a
30-year
period.
at
the
very
most,
this
court
talked
about
a
three-year
period.
the
carlsons'
purchase
--
the
lien
in
this
matter
was
filed
in
1950
at
the
time
before
the
facts
which
were
referred
to
in
union
central
occurred
and
the
trial
court
distinguished
this
case
from
the
union
central
case.
but
the
trial
court
went
on
further
with
the
decision
in
the
chicot
county
case
and
the
other
decisions
of
this
case
indicating
that
where
vested
rights
are
involved
that
this
court
may,
in
those
circumstances,
determine
that
the
--
it's
decisions
will
be
prospective
rather
than
retrospective
as
to
the
effects
of
transactions
which
occurred
before
the
decision
of
this
court.
now,
i
grant
you
the
government
argues
in
this
case
that
the
chicot
case
and
the
rockaway
new
supply
company
case
and
the
linkletter
case,
all
dealt
with
other
areas.
but
the
premise
is
there
and
that
if
rights
become
vested
that
this
court
has
a
right
to
make
such
a
determination
that
these
rights
shall
not
be
affected
by
a
decision,
and
these
decisions
should
not
be
retroactive
where
the
affect
would
be
such
as
it
is
in
this
carlson
case.
the
government
is
well
able
to
protect
itself
in
tax
lien
matters
and
has
shown
the
ability
to
protect
itself.
this
court
should
keep
in
mind
in
deciding
whether
to
make
the
union
central
case
retrospective
as
far
as
the
carlsons
are
concerned,
the
fact
that
the
tax
liens
where
filed
in
1950,
the
foreclosure
was
not
filed
until
december
30,
1966,
almost
four
years
after
donnelly
died
during
which
time
the
assets
of
donnelly,
if
he
had
any
could
of
have
dissipated.
and
16
years,
almost
17
years,
after
the
tax
lien
notices
where
filed
during
which
time,
they
were
two
extensions
of
donnelly's
liability,
one
extension
which
we
don't
admit
that
validity
of
was
signed
after
donnelly
sold
this
property
to
the
carlsons.
so
in
other
words,
donnelly
in
1961
signed
an
extension
agreement
with
the
government
continuing
that
liability
for
another
fiver
years
and
he
didn't
own
the
property
anymore.
now,
this
issue
was
not
litigated
in
lower
court,
but
it
shows
the
equities
of
the
situation
in
this
matter
and
the
equities
are
basically
what
the
trial
court
in
the
court
of
appeals
felt
should
be
considered
in
whether
or
not
this
court
should
be
retrospective
or
prospective.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
well
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
not
defend
the
same
position
of
the
man
who
after
union
central,
it
becomes
a
law
of
the
land,
would
go
ahead
and
buy
piece
of
property
without
inquiring
it
to
the
question
of
whether
the
notice
was
property
recorded.
as
far
the
union
central
is
the
law
of
the
land,
as
far
as
that
is
concerned,
we're
not
taking
the
position
that
there
can
be
any
argument
at
that
point.
this
is
exactly
the
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
in
regard
to
this
scare
tactic
that
i
feel
the
government
has
used
here.
i'm
talking
about
the
affect
on
40,000
titles
in
four
other
states
other
than
the
state
of
michigan.
each
of
the
statutes
involved
in
that
situation
was
adopted
after
the
union
central
case.
so
if
property
purchasers,
lawyers,
title
examiners,
etcetera,
in
the
four
states
concern,
went
to
determine
the
relative
effects
of
their
statutes,
they
have
union
central
to
look
at.
they
don't
have
a
case
on
the
books
for
15
years
that
says
just
the
opposite
of
the
union
central,
which
was
the
case
in
michigan
with
the
youngblood,
that
on
appeal
from
the
decision
of
the
second
highest
court,
deciding
that
the
michigan
had
a
valid
statute.
illinois,
wisconsin,
pennsylvania,
these
are
post
union
central
statutes
and
i
say
that
the
people
in
those
states
should
let
the
chips
fall
where
they
may,
but
the
government
shouldn't
use
this
decision
as
a
way
of
litigating
the
validity
of
the
statutes
in
these
four
states.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
not
all
of
them
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
i
cannot
answer
that
truthfully.
i
do
not
know
that
this
issue
was
raised
in
that
case
mr.
justice.
i
--
the
union
central
seemed
to
be
rather
unique
case
at
the
time.
michigan
is
the
only
state
that
had
that
particular
section
at
the
time.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
i
don't
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
i
don't
believe
that
the
issue
was
raised.
i
believe
that
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
here
has
the
question
before
of
the
situation
that
occurred
before
this
court's
decision
and
whether
this
court's
decision
should
be
made
retroactive
or
not.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
yes,
mr.
justice?
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
the
carlsons
will
be
faced
with
a
$36,000.00
foreclosure.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
that
is
right.
now,
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
yes.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
this
would
be
correct
mr.
justice.
i
misspoke
myself.
but,
we
have
among
other
things
that
we
--
mr.
justice,
we
contest
some
of
the
factual
allegations
such
as
the
signing
of
extensions.
we
don't
know
whether
the
amount
shown
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
there
are
factual
issues.
this
was
up
on
summary
judgment
before
the
district
court,
mr.
justice.
we
do
have
the
issue
that
i
mentioned
as
to
the
validity
of
the
signing
of
an
extension
after
the
property
is
sold
by
the
taxpayer.0
there's
been
no
precedent
on
this
in
the
--
by
this
court
or
for
that
matter
by
any
other
court
that
i
can
find
and
the
issue
was
not
litigated
before
and
would
have
to
be
litigated.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
that
is
right
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
that
is
correct,
but
the
time
sequence
would
indicate
that
the
michigan
decision
was
after
the
carlsons'
purchase
and
it
came
to
this
court
after
the
carlsons'
purchase.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
no.
the
--
in
the
state
of
michigan,
only
at
that
time,
only
the
supreme
court
decisions
were
printed.
i
cannot
say
when
the
circuit
court
litigation
which
was
involved
initially
in
the
union
central
case
was
actually
filed.
but
my
recollection
is
that
it
was
brought
before
the
michigan
supreme
court
for
a
decision
which
became
known
to
the
public
in
1961
and
when
the
michigan
court
ruled
against
the
government,
certiorari
was
granted
by
this
court
and
case
heard
also
that
year,
all
of
these
events
were
after
the
carlsons'
purchase.
there
was
no
knowledge
in
their
part
or
for
that
matter
by
the
bar
in
general
that
this
issue
was
going
to
be
litigated
by
this
court
in
1961.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
only
by
word
of
mouth
mr.
justice.
as
i
say
at
that
time,
the
only
michigan
decisions
that
were
printed
were
the
supreme
court.
now,
there
is
a
intermediate
appeals
court
in
michigan
where
they
have
printed
decisions,
they
did
not
have
that
court
at
that
time.
so
the
michigan
supreme
court
decision
was
printed
in
1961
which
was
again
as
i
say,
after
the
carlsons'
purchase.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
i
believe
it
was
decided
in
1961
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
that
was
decided
in
december
of
1961,
and
i
believe
that
the
michigan
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
the
michigan
court
if
i
recall,
was
in
the
early
part
of
1961.
it
was
after
the
carlsons'
purchase,
that
i'm
sure
of.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
right.
oh,
60?
than
i
stand
corrected,
except
that
it
was
again,
about
six
weeks
after
the
carlsons'
purchase.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
this
is
true.
as
a
circuit
court
in
another
county
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
not
in
--
no.
the
district
court
was
not
involved.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
at
that
time,
there
was
the
circuit
court
and
an
appeal
directly
to
the
state
supreme
court,
and
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court
was
not
generally
made
public,
unless
somebody
happen
to
be
familiar
with
it
or
come
across
it
in
the
newspaper.
we
have
not
discussed
today,
the
issue
that
we
have
raised
here
in
regard
to
the
necessity
of
recording
a
tax
lien
notice,
when
after
acquired
property
is
involved.
now,
this
matter
is
covered
in
our
brief.
we
feel
that
is
an
issue
that
is
never
been
passed
upon
by
this
court
and
this
is
that
the
entireties
property
which
was
acquired
by
donnelly
and
his
wife
in
1949,
was
not
donnelly's,
or
for
that
matter
was
not
donnelly's
for
the
tax
lien
notice
to
attach
to
until
1960
when
mrs.
donnelly
died
and
the
property
at
that
time
became
that
of
donnelly.
and
we
cited
in
our
brief,
the
hutchinson
case
as
well
as
the
nathanson
case,
and
the
american
national
bank
case
dealing
with
law
similar
to
michigan
or
the
nathanson
case,
the
michigan
law,
all
of
which
says
that
in
an
estate
by
the
entireties,
neither
the
husband
or
the
wife
individually
own
an
interest
in
a
piece
of
--
in
the
entireties
property
which
is
capable
of
standing
alone
of
being
levied
upon
for
the
tax
liability
of
one
spouse.
the
hutchinson
case
by
the
court
of
appeals,
as
well
as
the
american
national
bank
case,
both
indicate
that
the
federal
tax
lien
does
not
attach
to
entireties
property
until
the
death
of
one
of
the
spouses.
it
is
our
position
that
a
clear
reading
of
the
internal
revenue
code
recording
provisions
would
require
the
filing
of
a
notice
as
against
after
acquired
property
in
a
state
where
such
a
notice
had
not
been
previously
filed
at
the
time
such
property
is
acquired
by
the
taxpayer.
now,
the
glass
city
bank
case
is
my
learned
colleague
indicated,
says
that
a
tax
lien
attaches
to
after
acquired
property.
but
there
is
a
void
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned,
as
to
what
the
government
must
do
to
perfect
that
tax
lien
against
such
after
acquired
property.
the
lien
is
a
legal
status.
the
notice
of
that
lien
is
a
notice
to
the
world
which
perfects
that
lien
as
against
intervening
third
parties.
and
in
this
situation,
the
government
has
said
in
affect
that
if
union
central
applies
to
the
federal
filing
of
the
notice
in
this
case,
the
1950,
that
that
notice
in
1950
is
good
in
perpetuity
to
all
notices
filed
in
the
federal
court
on
forever
until
those
liens
are
no
longer
enforceable.
we
feel
that
this
is
not
the
law
and
it
is
not
the
intent
of
the
law.
the
internal
revenue
code
says,
that
notice
shall
be
filed
whenever
the
state
has
designated
a
state
office
and
the
word
whenever
means
at
such
time
as
and
i
don't
think
that
the
internal
revenue
code
has
to
be
construed
to
mean
that
a
notice
filed
in
the
federal
court
is
good
forever.
i'm
not
saying
that
it
affects
liens
that
were
existence
against
property,
in
the
existence
when
the
lien
was
filed.
but
if
the
state
adopts
a
valid
state
recording
law,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
government
must
at
that
time
go
an
comply
with
that
state
law
as
to
property
which
comes
into
existence
after
that
state
law
is
adopted.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
yes.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
mr.
chief
justice
as
i
said
before.
this
exception
was
not
something
that
they
typed
in
just
for
mr.
carlson.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
for
everybody.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
on
hindsight.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
on
hindsight
mr.
chief
justice.
in
other
words,
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
well
--
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
well
mr.
chief
justice
and
again,
this
is
from
my
own
knowledge
and
whether
i
can
say
this
to
be
considered
by
this
court,
i
will
say
that
as
of
1970,
the
abstract
companies
in
michigan
used
that
same
exception.
the
difference
being
that
now,
they
aren't
tax
liens
filed
in
the
federal
court
anyway
and
the
exception
doesn't
mean
anything.
but
if
for
some
reason,
this
court
in
some
other
situation,
a
year
from
now,
determined
that
the
present
michigan
law
was
invalid
then
we
have
the
same
problem
all
over
again.
in
other
words,
they
have
that
in
there
because
they
don't
look
at
the
federal
court
and
they
didn't
look
at
the
federal
court
recordings
of
1960
at
this
transaction
because
it
was
assumed
for
almost
40
years
that
they
didn't
file
tax
liens
in
michigan
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
if
they
did
not
indicate
that
a
separate
request
would
have
to
be
made
for
federal
court
lien,
it
very
well
could
be,
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
n.
pevos
i
would
say
that
may
have
been,
but
at
the
time,
they
would
have
been
a
question
whether
or
not
the
even
the
entry
of
a
federal
recording
would
have
been
anything
except
actual
notice
as
opposed
to
constructive
notice
until
the
union
central
case
was
handed
down.
the
federal
filing
may
not
have
been
a
valid
filing,
even
if
it
was
there.
and
i
believe
that
there
is
a
void
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
law
as
to
whether
actual
notice
stands
in
the
place
of
constructive
notice
in
regard
to
the
federal
tax
lien
notice
filings.
that,
i
don't
think
is
been
clearly
raised.
thank
you.
