justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
that
would
--
why
then
as
mr.
chief
justice
asked
would
you
put
in
this
exception
of
the
title
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
exception
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
mention
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
that
something
in
this
regard
the
judgments?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
it
noted
in
the
union
central
case
here
that
the
court
in
union
central
was
viewing
a
decision
of
the
state
supreme
court
of
michigan?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
was
recited
here
that
the
michigan
decision
was
in
conflict
with
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
the
eighth
circuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
i
would
take
that
the
union
central
case
had
been
in
litigation
for
some
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
anyway
for
it
to
acquire
donnelly?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
decided
in
1960?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
union
central
by
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
in
the
michigan
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
the
date
on
the
opinion
is
september
16,
1960?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
went
to
the
lower
courts
of
--
it
had
been
decided
in
the
circuit
court
obviously
before
the
purchase?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
after
--
just
two
levels.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
that
would
--
why
then
as
mr.
chief
justice
asked
would
you
put
in
this
exception
of
the

here?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the

say?
justice
