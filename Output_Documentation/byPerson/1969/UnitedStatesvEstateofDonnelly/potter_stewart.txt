well,
except
that
the
--
there
wasn't
every
reason
to
do
so
for
the
title
searchers
to
do
so
at
the
time
the
search
of
this
title
was
made,
unless
i
misunderstand
something
here
because
of
the
existing
decision
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
fact,
yes
in
which
--
and
that
was
the
law,
so
far
as
michigan
liens
went
at
the
time
that
this
search
was
made,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
youngblood
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
on
what
grounds?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
ground
that
that
decision
might
be
wrong
unless
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
some
day
be
overruled?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
michigan
laws
now
have
been
changed,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
civil
cases
and
particularly
in
cases
involving
property
rights
in
reliance,
the
several
cases
that
chicot
county
gray
district
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
--
was
long
before
the
union
central?
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
the
--
you
did
file
a
--
you
did
make
a
non-descriptive
federal
filing
in
wayne
county,
michigan
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
accepted
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
by
the
register?
justice
potter
stewart
or
is
the
title
opinion
in
the
appendix
somewhere
or?
justice

stewart
where
is
this
disclaimer

caveat
appear
in
the
record
we
have
before
us
here?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
want
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
during
the
colloquy
here
somewhere.
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
wondered
how
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
we
know
how
my
brothers
know
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
one
will
appear
in
the
opinion,
in
the
title
opinion.
it's
somewhere
here
in
the
appendix
in
the
colloquy
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
for
some
other
lien
arising
from
some
other
--
justice
potter
stewart
your
point,
your
point
is
it
didn't
help
the
government?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
you
have
other
claims
before
the
district
court,
but
that
court
did
not
reach
because
it
decided
the
case
on
this
issue,
but
even
if
the
union
central
is
retroactive,
it
would
be,
in
my
understanding
that
you
had
other
claims,
peculiar
perhaps
to
your
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
even
if
we
should
hold
that
union
central
decision
is
fully
retroactive,
then
our
actions
should
be
in
your
submission,
we
should
remand
the
case
for
the
courts
to
turn
their
attention
with
the
other
--
to
your
other
claims?
