excuse

chief

what's
your
hypothesis
as
to
why
the
title

would
put
an
exception
indicating
that
he
had
not
searched
for
the

what

of

but
something
led
the

examiner,
the
title

to
draw
attention
to
the
federal

lien
problem,
did
it
not?
chief

what
are
the

any
different
really
for
a
man
who
got
in
this
predicament
after
the
holding
in

if
he
did
not
exercise
the
cautious
approach
and
check
with

chief

mr.

chief

warren
e.

the
record
as
i
read
it,
indicates
that
the
court,
i
think
it
was
the
court,
united
states
district
judge
made
some
inquiry
about
whether
the
purchasers
had
any
right
of
action
back
against
the
abstract
company,
the
title
company
that
had
prepared
the
abstract
in
either
your
response
to
that
of
someone
else
speaking
for
this
litigating
party
as
i
think
it
was,
your
statement.
but
there
was
no
action
against
the
abstract
company
because
they
protected
themselves
by
making
an
exception
with
respect
to
liens
which
were
on
the
file
in
the
federal
district
court
among
other
places.
now,
wasn't
that
enough
when
we're
talking
about
the
equities?
wasn't
that
situation
enough
to
put
the
purchaser
and
his
attorney
on
notice?
chief

e.

no,
they
typed
in
for

chief

e.

for
what
reason?
chief

e.

to
protect
themselves.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
would
regard
that
as
foresight
on
the
part
of
the
abstract
company.
now,
hindsight
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
they
protected
themselves
as
you
indicated
to
the
trial
judge
by
having
that
exception
saying
they
were
calling
attention
to
possible
liens
that
they
had
not
searched
for
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
absent
that
statement
by
the
abstract
company,
they
might
well
be
liable
to
the
purchaser,
would
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
their
foresight
as
distinguished
from
hindsight,
their
foresight
as
protected
them
and
in
the
same
manner,
the
purchaser
could
have
protected
himself
by
saying
in
effect
if
his
lawyer
was
not
experienced
enough,
what
do
you
mean
by
this
and
how
much
does
it
cost
and
upon
finding
that
it
will
cost
$3.00
or
$4.00
perhaps
to
make
that
search
routinely
or
even
less,
depending
on
the
number
of
entries,
even
he
would
have
then
been
protected,
wouldn't
he?
