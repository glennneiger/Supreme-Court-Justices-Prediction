mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
tax
lien
case
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
it
involves
the
question
whether
a
federal
tax
lien
with
respect
to
a
parcel
of
improved
real
property,
located
in
livingston
county,
michigan
is
prior
to
the
interest
in
that
property
of
subsequent
purchases
of
the
property.
the
united
states
acquired
its
lien
in
1950,
when
it
secured
a
tax
court
judgment
against
thomas
donnelly
for
some
$26,000.00.
when
that
judgment
went
unpaid,
united
states
acquired
a
lien
under
section
3670
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939,
which
appears
at
page
17
of
our
brief
in
the
appendix
and
the
lien
arose
in
favor
of
the
united
states
?upon
all
property
and
rights
to
property
whether
real
or
personal
belonging
to
such
person.
in
1945
in
this
court's
decision
in
the
glass
city
bank
case,
it
was
held
that
the
lien
of
the
united
states
under
section
3670
applies
not
only
to
a
taxpayer's
present
property,
but
also
to
any
after
acquired
property.
to
ensure
that
its
lien
would
be
prior
to
the
interest
of
subsequent
purchases
and
others
however,
the
united
states
must
give
due
notice
of
the
lien
by
filing
a
notice
of
the
lien
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
section
3672
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
which
also
appear
beginning
on
page
17
of
our
brief.
section
3672
provides
that
?such
lien
shall
not
be
valid
as
against
any
mortgagee,
pledgee,
purchaser
or
judgment
creditor
until
notice
thereof
has
been
filed
by
the
collector;
one,
in
the
office
in
which
the
filing
of
such
notice
is
authorized
by
the
law
of
the
state
or
territory
in
which
the
property
subject
to
the
lien
is
situated,
whenever
the
state
or
territory
has
by
law
authorized
the
filing
of
such
notice
in
an
office
within
the
state
or
territory;
or
two,
in
the
office
of
the
clerk
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
judicial
district
in
which
the
property
is
subject
to
the
lien
is
situated
whenever
the
state
or
territory
has
not
by
law
authorized
the
filing
of
such
notice
in
an
office
within
the
state
or
territory.
?
in
short,
the
question
whether
the
united
states
is
to
file
locally
under
subdivision
1
of
section
3672
a
or
subdivision
2
thereof,
turns
on
whether
the
local
law
authorizes
local
filing.
the
michigan
statute
which
purported
to
authorize
local
filing
here
appears
on
page
18
of
our
brief,
and
with
respect
to
real
property,
it
provides
in
the
pre
penultimate
line
on
page
18
that
a
description
of
the
land
upon
which
a
lien
is
claimed
is
to
be
included
in
the
notice
of
the
lien.
the
consistent
practice
of
the
united
states,
however,
is
not
to
describe
any
property
in
a
notice
of
lien
but
simply
to
file
what
is
commonly
referred
to
as
a
blanket
notice
of
lien
which
merely
re-echoes
the
provisions
of
section
3670,
names
the
taxpayer
and
specifies
the
amount
of
his
indebtedness
to
the
united
states.
in
united
states
against
union
central
life
insurance
company,
decided
by
this
court
in
1961,
it
was
held
that
the
michigan
law
because
of
its
description
requirement
did
not
authorize
local
filing
and
that
the
united
states
in
that
case
had
properly
filed
its
notice
of
lien
in
the
federal
district
court.
quoting
from
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
black,
368
u.s.
at
296,
the
michigan
law
authorizing
filing
only
if
a
description
of
the
property
was
placed,
was
given,
placed
obstacles
to
the
enforcement
of
federal
tax
liens
that
congress
had
not
permitted
and
consequently
no
state
officer
was
quote
?authorized?
for
filing
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
statute.
it
was
therefore
error
for
the
michigan
courts
to
fail
to
give
priority
to
the
government's
lien
here,
notice
of
which
had
been
filed
in
the
district
court
in
accordance
with
federal
law.
as
in
the
union
central
case,
the
united
states
here
filed
its
tax
lien
in
the
eastern
district
court
for
michigan
rather
than
would
be
local
office
of
the
recorder
of
deeds
for
livingston
county
and
the
question
is
whether
its
filing
was
proper
under
section
3672
of
the
1939
code.
the
taxpayer,
thomas
donnelly,
acquired
the
property
in
question
here
in
1949
by
purchase
with
his
wife
as
tenants
by
the
entireties
and
it
was
held
by
the
entireties
until
1960
when
mrs.
donnelly
died
and
by
operation
of
law,
mr.
donnelly
became
a
sole
owner.
shortly
after
mrs.
donnelly's
death,
mr.
donnelly
sold
the
property
to
mr.
and
mrs.
carlson,
who
are
the
real
parties
in
interest
here.
the
carlsons
where
bona
fide
purchasers
of
the
property,
admittedly.
they
had
an
abstract
prepared
by
the
livingston
county
abstract
office
which
covered
only
the
local
filings
in
livingston
county,
michigan,
and
with
specifically
accepted
covering
any
filings
that
were
made
in
the
federal
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
michigan.
the
attorneys,
who
passed
upon
the
marketability
of
the
title
for
the
carlsons,
relied
upon
the
abstract
that
had
been
prepared
by
the
livingston
county
abstract
office
and
accordingly,
they
did
not
find
notice
of
the
federal
tax
lien
that
had
been
filed
in
the
district
court.
after
the
carlsons
purchased
the
property
in
1960,
the
united
states
move
to
foreclose
its
tax
lien,
and
the
carlsons
objected.
they
move
for
summary
judgment
in
the
district
court
and
summary
judgment
in
their
favor
was
granted.
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed
on
appeal
without
opinion.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
so
far
as
description
requirement,
your
honor?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
don't
think
it
is.
there
are
several
hundreds
of
cases
in
michigan
alone
which
we
think
that
the
decision
here
would
control
and
in
addition
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
there
are
some
40,000
tax
liens
that
might
be
cast
in
jeopardy
in
four
other
states,
illinois,
pennsylvania,
wisconsin,
and
massachusetts
if
the
court
were
to
affirmed
the
judgment
below.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
frankly
don't
know
your
honor.
it
seems
to
us
that
they
had
every
reason
to
do
so
as
i
hope
to
explain
later
on.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that's
right.
we
concede
that
they're
bona
fide
purchasers.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir,
we
do.
we
say
so
because
we
think
union
central
said
so.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
it
is.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
think
there
was
every
reason
for
them
to
do
so,
even
though
they
had
the
youngblood
decision
as
that
the
one
that
you're
referring
to?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
don't
think
it
was.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
1944,
and
union
central
held
that
a
local
register
of
deeds
was
not
permitted
to
accept
for
filing
a
non-descriptive
federal
notice.
moreover,
in
1945
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
the
day
of
youngblood
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
was
1944.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
and
youngblood
held
that
a
local
register
of
deeds
was
not
entitled
to
accept
for
filing
a
non-descriptive
federal
notice.
now,
went
on
--
that
was
the
only
issue
in
that
case
your
honor.
the
united
states
moved
to
mandamus
to
register
of
deeds
at
wayne
county
there
and
the
court
did
go
on,
we
concede
and
quite
clearly
to
say
that
the
michigan
law
wasn't
authorized
law
within
the
meaning
of
section
3672,
but
we
would
suggest
that
that
was
all
dictum.
the
only
issue
in
that
case
was
whether
the
united
states
was
entitled
to
file
a
non-descriptive
notice
in
the
local
michigan
courts.
but
there
are
a
number
of
other
reasons
why
a
title
searcher
in
1960
should
have
searched
the
federal
files
as
well
as
the
local
files.
one
year
after
the
youngblood
was
decided,
this
court
held
in
the
glass
city
bank
case
that
the
united
states
tax
lien
under
section
3670
applied
to
after
acquired
property.
now
obviously,
after
acquired
property
cannot
be
described
in
a
notice
which
previously
filed,
so
we
think
a
reasonable
lawyer
or
reasonable
title
searcher
would
well
have
been
on
notice
as
to
the
possibility
of
liens
that
federally
filed.
moreover,
in
1952
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
an
article
appeared
in
the
michigan
law
review
which
said
that
lawyers
should
perhaps
even
need
to
check
federal
filings.
in
1958
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
on
the
ground
that
glass
city
bank
and
the
ground
that
the
statute
and
legislative
history
as
construed
by
the
sixth
circuit
was
just
construed
wrong.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
i
don't
know
overruled.
as
i
say,
we
view
the
remainder
of
the
opinion
in
youngblood
beyond
the
point
where
the
court
held
that
a
federal
non-descriptive
notice
was
not
on
top
to
filing
as
dictum.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
now,
i
can
see
that
the
court
made
it
quite
clear
that
it
was
reaffirming
its
decision
in
the
maniaci
case,
but
nevertheless
was
dictum.
glass
city
and
youngblood,
it
seems
to
us
cannot
stand
together
and
glass
city
was
decided
only
a
year
after
youngblood.
the
wright
article
in
1952,
we
think
suggested
that
a
problem
existed,
and
in
1958
in
the
rasmussen
case,
the
eighth
circuit
reached
exactly
the
contrary
conclusion
from
the
conclusion
which
the
sixth
circuit
had
reached
in
its
dictum
in
youngblood.
and
so,
by
the
time
the
carlsons
purchase
this
property
in
1960,
it
seems
to
us
it
was
clear
enough
that
there
was
a
problem
and
we
don't
say
that
the
law
was
clear.
we
do
say
that
there
was
confusion
and
we
think
this
confusion
was
recognized
by
title
searchers
in
michigan
and
that
is
the
reason
why
they
accepted
from
the
abstract
to
get
themselves
off
the
hook
from
federal
filings.
all
of
these
reasons
we
think
undercut
the
argument
that
the
carlsons
made
that
they
justifiably
relied
on
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
think
it
would,
but
respondents
tell
us
that
everybody
did
it
the
other
way
and
nobody
paid
attention
to
the
federal
filings.
our
position
here
is
where
they
are
asking
that
union
central
be
applied
prospectively
only
is
it
they
have
to
show
some
real
justifiable
reliance
to
warrant
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
applied
by
this
court
that
its
decisions
apply
retrospectively
as
well
as
prospectively
and
we
don't
think
they
have.
indeed,
the
mortgagee
in
the
union
central
case
was
in
precisely
the
same
position
as
the
carlsons
where
here.
they
couldn't
have
known
that
youngblood
was
going
to
be
discredited
by
this
court,
but
there
is
no
hint
in
mr.
justice
black's
opinion
that
that
decision
was
to
be
prospective
only.
regarding
this
question
of
prospectiveness
versus
retroactivity,
we
have
reviewed
the
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
either
the
district
court
your
honor
or
locally
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
for
all
practical
purposes,
although
at
some
of
more
complicated
as
almost
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
now.
there
have
been
several
amendments
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
eh
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
ah
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
it
was
changed
in
august
of
1956
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
--
at
which
time,
michigan
adopted
the
uniform
tax
lien
registration
act.
in
addition
to
the
justifiable
reliance
point,
the
court
in
its
decision
in
the
linkletter
case
and
the
progeny
of
that
case
largely
in
the
criminal
area
in
deciding
whether
decision
should
be
applied
prospectively
only
or
retroactively.
and
more
recently
in
cipriano
against
city
of
houma,
voting
rights
case,
have
looked
to
three
factors
to
determine
whether
the
decision
should
be
retroactive
or
not.
the
first
as
we
have
mentioned
is
justifiable
reliance
and
for
the
reasons
i've
outlined,
we
don't
think
that
the
carlsons
could
have
justifiably
relied.
the
second
factor
is
whether
the
purpose
of
the
new
rule
would
be
frustrated,
if
the
decision
were
applied
prospectively
only.
and
here,
we
think
it
would
because
as
a
result
of
the
change
in
the
michigan
law
to
which
mr.
justice
stewart
referred,
there
will
be
no
other
cases
probably
that
govern
by
union
central
and
union
central
will
stand
by
itself
as
one
and
only
decision
having
no
application
outside
of
its
four
corners.
finally,
the
court
has
looked
to
whether
the
affect
of
holding
a
decision
prospective
in
the
criminal
area
whether
the
affect
of
that
would
impair
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
analogy
here
is
what
it
would
do
to
other
federal
tax
liens
and
again
as
i've
noted
it,
it
would
cast
cloud
on
some
40,000
of
them.
so
for
all
of
these
reasons,
we
don't
think
union
central
can
be
considered
a
prospective
only
decision
that
it
is
clearly
governing
here.
the
same
law
was
construed
by
this
court,
only
eight
years
ago,
and
it
was
held
not
to
authorize
a
federal
filing.
i
might
add
that
the
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
when
did
the
first
--
yes
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
the
early
--
one
of
the
earliest
cases
would
be
the
georgia
--
chicot
county
case,
but
as
i
say,
i
think
that
since
linkletter
in
1965,
the
courts
been
faced
with
the
series
of
problems,
largely
in
the
criminal
area
but
more
recently
in
cipriano
against
city
of
houma.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
oh,
yes.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
but
the
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that's
true
your
honor.
but
that
case,
it
seems
to
us
was
a
largely
based
on
considerations
of
res
judicata,
the
parties
and
interest
there
having
themselves
litigated
the
case,
whereas
here
the
carlsons
admitted
they
where
not
parties
to
the
union
central
decision.
and
we
don't
think
that
the
considerations
are
all
the
same,
and
in
any
event,
we
don't
think
the
reliance
was
justifiable
for
the
reasons
i've
outlined.
i
might
say
that
the
carlsons
did
have
a
terrible
problem
here,
but
so
does
the
internal
revenue
service
in
filing
in
his
liens.
in
the
maniaci
case
which
was
decided
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
1940,
the
united
states
filed
its
lien
both
federally
and
locally,
and
its
interest
was
still
held
subordinate
to
the
interest
of
a
subsequent
bona
fide
purchaser.
in
union
central,
in
youngblood
rather,
it
tried
to
file
its
notice
federally
and
it
was
held
that
it
was
not
entitled
to
file
its
notice
federally
and
here
again,
it
has
done
so.
the
sixth
circuit,
it
seems
to
us
has
held
that
no
matter
what
the
united
states
does
to
file
a
federal
tax
lien,
whether
it
would
be
local
or
federal,
it
cannot
prevail.
the
court
below
--
the
district
court
in
addition
to
relying
on
its
prospectivity
argument
also
found
that
union
central
was
distinguishable.
it
said
that
there
was
an
unsuccessful
filing
attempt
in
the
union
central
case
with
the
local
register
of
deeds.
that
is
not
the
case
so
far
as
the
opinion
of
this
court
and
the
record
show,
although
it
was
stipulated
in
that
case,
that
the
oakland
county
register
of
deeds
had
a
policy
of
not
accepting
non-descriptive
federal
filings.
the
point
the
district
court
seems
to
make
is
that
had
the
united
states'
attempted
to
file
federally
or
locally,
it
would
have
been
accepted
by
the
register
of
deeds
here,
and
therefore
this
would
have
given
notice
to
the
carlsons.
we
don't
know
if
that's
the
case
or
not
because
the
united
states
did
file
a
non-descriptive
notice
in
maniaci
and
it
was
held
that
the
subsequent
purchases
nevertheless
prevail.
moreover,
the
law
as
expounded
by
the
michigan
attorney
general
in
1953
in
his
decision
that
federal
non-descriptive
notices
were
not
entitled
to
be
filed
locally
was
nothing
new.
if
i
may
quote
from
the
decision
in
youngblood
in
1944,
?no
ambiguity
in
here
is
in
the
michigan
statute.
its
mandate
that
the
notice
of
lien
shall
contain
a
description
of
the
land
is
unmistakable
and
the
authority
of
the
register
of
deeds,
a
ministerial
officer,
is
clearly
limited
to
the
recordation
of
only
such
notices
of
united
states
tax
liens
as
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
statute.
?
this
is
what
the
sixth
circuit
held
in
1944,
and
this
is
what
the
attorney
general
held
in
his
opinion
in
1953.
it
was
nothing
new.
the
question
is
not
whether
a
local
register
of
deeds
would
or
would
not
have
accepted
a
non-descriptive
federal
filing.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
in
wayne
county,
michigan,
yes.
yes,
we
did.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
it
was.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
apparently
contrary
to
what
the
clear
law
of
michigan
was
as
construed
by
this
court
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
youngblood
case.
but
the
point
is
that
whether
a
filing
would
or
would
not
have
been
accepted
is
not
the
issue.
the
question
is
whether
the
local
law
authorized
a
filing
on
the
basis
and
on
the
conditions
that
the
michigan
statute
plainly
imposed
and
that
question
was
answered
by
this
court
in
the
union
central
case,
in
the
negative.
we
think
that
union
central
is
controlling
here
and
that
the
judgment
below
must
therefore
be
reversed
on
the
authority
of
union
central.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
it
does.
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
may
it
please
the
court,
just
two
or
three
brief
points.
first,
here
that
the
respondents
are
asking
that
a
decision
of
this
court
be
applied
prospectively
only.
they
point
to
the
fact
that
the
united
states
filed
locally
in
wayne
county
in
1950
and
locally
in
genesee
in
livingston
county
in
1960.
this
is
the
case.
the
law
was
confused,
but
the
respondents
are
the
ones
that
are
asking
that
it'd
applied
prospectively
only,
and
contrary
to
what
the
district
court
said
on
page
56
of
the
record,
the
next
to
last
line,
it
says,
prior
to
that
decision
referring
to
this
court's
decision
in
union
central,
there
was
no
indication
that
such
statute
would
be
declared
per
se
illegal.
on
the
contrary,
every
indication
was
that
the
statute
would
be
upheld.
we
have
outlined
previously
that
it
was
not
just
a
law
review
article
in
1952
pointing
out
the
problem,
glass
city
bank
and
youngblood
cannot
stand
together.
that
was
the
decision
of
this
court,
and
that
should
have
put
on
notice,
reasonable
purchasers
of
property
and
others
in
michigan.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
youngblood,
decided
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
1944,
and
holding
that
a
description
--
no,
and
glass
city
bank.
because
glass
city
bank
said
that
the
united
states
lien
applies
to
after
acquired
property,
and
there
is
no
way
who
describe
that
for
acquired
property
in
a
notice
because
we
don't
know
what
that
property
is
going
to
be.
respondents
seek
to
support
the
judgment
below
on
the
ground
that
the
united
states
should
have
refiled
in
1960
after
michigan
had
passed
the
uniform
tax
lien
registration
act
in
1956.
with
regard
to
that,
i
think
that
the
differences
between
this
court's
views
and
that
of
the
sixth
circuit
are
made
quite
clear.
with
reference
to
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion
in
the
faulk
case
which
has
pending
on
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari
in
number
844,
and
the
statement
of
mr.
justice
black's
in
the
union
central
case.
in
order
for
the
united
states
to
re-file,
every
time
a
delinquent
taxpayer
acquires
property
afterwards
it
has
to
follow
that
taxpayer
around
and
keep
tabs
on
him.
now
in
the
faulk
case
which
is
quoted
on
page
13
of
respondent's
brief,
the
sixth
circuit
said
?some
government
scrutiny
of
the
affairs
of
delinquent
taxpayers
sufficient
to
enable
it,
to
know
where
to
properly
file
notice
of
lien?
seem
to
have
been
contemplated
by
this
entire
statutory
scheme.
requiring
the
government
to
investigate
the
affairs
of
the
delinquent
taxpayer
to
determine
to
what
property
the
statutory
lien
attaches
and
therefore,
where
to
properly
file
the
required
notice
of
lien
in
no
way
cuts
down
on
the
broad
scope
of
the
lien.
that
is
not
the
case
and
that
is
to
be
compared
with
the
statement
of
mr.
justice
black,
368
u.s.
294
and
?it
seems
obvious
that
this
expansive
protection
for
the
government,
that
is
the
protection
that
its
lien
runs
to
after
acquired
property
would
be
greatly
reduced
if
to
enforce
it,
government
agents
were
compelled
to
keep
aware
at
all
times
of
all
property
coming
into
the
hands
of
its
tax
delinquents.?
the
sixth
circuit
has
been
out
of
steps
since
the
maniaci
case
in
1940.
united
states
filed
both
locally
and
federally
in
that
case
and
it
lost.
it
attempted
to
file
locally
in
youngblood
and
it
lost.
union
central
is
controlling
here
and
there's
no
basis
for
a
prospective
only
holding.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
tax
lien
case
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
it
involves
the
question
whether
a
federal
tax
lien
with
respect
to
a
parcel
of
improved
real
property,
located
in
livingston
county,
michigan
is
prior
to
the
interest
in
that
property
of
subsequent
purchases
of
the
property.
the
united
states
acquired
its
lien
in
1950,
when
it
secured
a
tax
court
judgment
against
thomas
donnelly
for
some
$26,000.00.
when
that
judgment
went
unpaid,
united
states
acquired
a
lien
under
section
3670
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939,
which
appears
at
page
17
of
our
brief
in
the
appendix
and
the
lien
arose
in
favor
of
the
united
states
?upon
all
property
and
rights
to
property
whether
real
or
personal
belonging
to
such
person.
in
1945
in
this
court's
decision
in
the
glass
city
bank
case,
it
was
held
that
the
lien
of
the
united
states
under
section
3670
applies
not
only
to
a
taxpayer's
present
property,
but
also
to
any
after
acquired
property.
to
ensure
that
its
lien
would
be
prior
to
the
interest
of
subsequent
purchases
and
others
however,
the
united
states
must
give
due
notice
of
the
lien
by
filing
a
notice
of
the
lien
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
section
3672
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
which
also
appear
beginning
on
page
17
of
our
brief.
section
3672
provides
that
?such
lien
shall
not
be
valid
as
against
any
mortgagee,
pledgee,
purchaser
or
judgment
creditor
until
notice
thereof
has
been
filed
by
the
collector;
one,
in
the
office
in
which
the
filing
of
such
notice
is
authorized
by
the
law
of
the
state
or
territory
in
which
the
property
subject
to
the
lien
is
situated,
whenever
the
state
or
territory
has
by
law
authorized
the
filing
of
such
notice
in
an
office
within
the
state
or
territory;
or
two,
in
the
office
of
the
clerk
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
judicial
district
in
which
the
property
is
subject
to
the
lien
is
situated
whenever
the
state
or
territory
has
not
by
law
authorized
the
filing
of
such
notice
in
an
office
within
the
state
or
territory.
?
in
short,
the
question
whether
the
united
states
is
to
file
locally
under
subdivision
1
of
section
3672
a
or
subdivision
2
thereof,
turns
on
whether
the
local
law
authorizes
local
filing.
the
michigan
statute
which
purported
to
authorize
local
filing
here
appears
on
page
18
of
our
brief,
and
with
respect
to
real
property,
it
provides
in
the
pre
penultimate
line
on
page
18
that
a
description
of
the
land
upon
which
a
lien
is
claimed
is
to
be
included
in
the
notice
of
the
lien.
the
consistent
practice
of
the
united
states,
however,
is
not
to
describe
any
property
in
a
notice
of
lien
but
simply
to
file
what
is
commonly
referred
to
as
a
blanket
notice
of
lien
which
merely
re-echoes
the
provisions
of
section
3670,
names
the
taxpayer
and
specifies
the
amount
of
his
indebtedness
to
the
united
states.
in
united
states
against
union
central
life
insurance
company,
decided
by
this
court
in
1961,
it
was
held
that
the
michigan
law
because
of
its
description
requirement
did
not
authorize
local
filing
and
that
the
united
states
in
that
case
had
properly
filed
its
notice
of
lien
in
the
federal
district
court.
quoting
from
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
black,
368
u.s.
at
296,
the
michigan
law
authorizing
filing
only
if
a
description
of
the
property
was
placed,
was
given,
placed
obstacles
to
the
enforcement
of
federal
tax
liens
that
congress
had
not
permitted
and
consequently
no
state
officer
was
quote
?authorized?
for
filing
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
statute.
it
was
therefore
error
for
the
michigan
courts
to
fail
to
give
priority
to
the
government's
lien
here,
notice
of
which
had
been
filed
in
the
district
court
in
accordance
with
federal
law.
as
in
the
union
central
case,
the
united
states
here
filed
its
tax
lien
in
the
eastern
district
court
for
michigan
rather
than
would
be
local
office
of
the
recorder
of
deeds
for
livingston
county
and
the
question
is
whether
its
filing
was
proper
under
section
3672
of
the
1939
code.
the
taxpayer,
thomas
donnelly,
acquired
the
property
in
question
here
in
1949
by
purchase
with
his
wife
as
tenants
by
the
entireties
and
it
was
held
by
the
entireties
until
1960
when
mrs.
donnelly
died
and
by
operation
of
law,
mr.
donnelly
became
a
sole
owner.
shortly
after
mrs.
donnelly's
death,
mr.
donnelly
sold
the
property
to
mr.
and
mrs.
carlson,
who
are
the
real
parties
in
interest
here.
the
carlsons
where
bona
fide
purchasers
of
the
property,
admittedly.
they
had
an
abstract
prepared
by
the
livingston
county
abstract
office
which
covered
only
the
local
filings
in
livingston
county,
michigan,
and
with
specifically
accepted
covering
any
filings
that
were
made
in
the
federal
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
michigan.
the
attorneys,
who
passed
upon
the
marketability
of
the
title
for
the
carlsons,
relied
upon
the
abstract
that
had
been
prepared
by
the
livingston
county
abstract
office
and
accordingly,
they
did
not
find
notice
of
the
federal
tax
lien
that
had
been
filed
in
the
district
court.
after
the
carlsons
purchased
the
property
in
1960,
the
united
states
move
to
foreclose
its
tax
lien,
and
the
carlsons
objected.
they
move
for
summary
judgment
in
the
district
court
and
summary
judgment
in
their
favor
was
granted.
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed
on
appeal
without
opinion.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
so
far
as
description
requirement,
your
honor?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
don't
think
it
is.
there
are
several
hundreds
of
cases
in
michigan
alone
which
we
think
that
the
decision
here
would
control
and
in
addition
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
there
are
some
40,000
tax
liens
that
might
be
cast
in
jeopardy
in
four
other
states,
illinois,
pennsylvania,
wisconsin,
and
massachusetts
if
the
court
were
to
affirmed
the
judgment
below.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
frankly
don't
know
your
honor.
it
seems
to
us
that
they
had
every
reason
to
do
so
as
i
hope
to
explain
later
on.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that's
right.
we
concede
that
they're
bona
fide
purchasers.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir,
we
do.
we
say
so
because
we
think
union
central
said
so.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
it
is.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
think
there
was
every
reason
for
them
to
do
so,
even
though
they
had
the
youngblood
decision
as
that
the
one
that
you're
referring
to?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
don't
think
it
was.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
1944,
and
union
central
held
that
a
local
register
of
deeds
was
not
permitted
to
accept
for
filing
a
non-descriptive
federal
notice.
moreover,
in
1945
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
the
day
of
youngblood
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
was
1944.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
and
youngblood
held
that
a
local
register
of
deeds
was
not
entitled
to
accept
for
filing
a
non-descriptive
federal
notice.
now,
went
on
--
that
was
the
only
issue
in
that
case
your
honor.
the
united
states
moved
to
mandamus
to
register
of
deeds
at
wayne
county
there
and
the
court
did
go
on,
we
concede
and
quite
clearly
to
say
that
the
michigan
law
wasn't
authorized
law
within
the
meaning
of
section
3672,
but
we
would
suggest
that
that
was
all
dictum.
the
only
issue
in
that
case
was
whether
the
united
states
was
entitled
to
file
a
non-descriptive
notice
in
the
local
michigan
courts.
but
there
are
a
number
of
other
reasons
why
a
title
searcher
in
1960
should
have
searched
the
federal
files
as
well
as
the
local
files.
one
year
after
the
youngblood
was
decided,
this
court
held
in
the
glass
city
bank
case
that
the
united
states
tax
lien
under
section
3670
applied
to
after
acquired
property.
now
obviously,
after
acquired
property
cannot
be
described
in
a
notice
which
previously
filed,
so
we
think
a
reasonable
lawyer
or
reasonable
title
searcher
would
well
have
been
on
notice
as
to
the
possibility
of
liens
that
federally
filed.
moreover,
in
1952
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
an
article
appeared
in
the
michigan
law
review
which
said
that
lawyers
should
perhaps
even
need
to
check
federal
filings.
in
1958
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
on
the
ground
that
glass
city
bank
and
the
ground
that
the
statute
and
legislative
history
as
construed
by
the
sixth
circuit
was
just
construed
wrong.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
i
don't
know
overruled.
as
i
say,
we
view
the
remainder
of
the
opinion
in
youngblood
beyond
the
point
where
the
court
held
that
a
federal
non-descriptive
notice
was
not
on
top
to
filing
as
dictum.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
now,
i
can
see
that
the
court
made
it
quite
clear
that
it
was
reaffirming
its
decision
in
the
maniaci
case,
but
nevertheless
was
dictum.
glass
city
and
youngblood,
it
seems
to
us
cannot
stand
together
and
glass
city
was
decided
only
a
year
after
youngblood.
the
wright
article
in
1952,
we
think
suggested
that
a
problem
existed,
and
in
1958
in
the
rasmussen
case,
the
eighth
circuit
reached
exactly
the
contrary
conclusion
from
the
conclusion
which
the
sixth
circuit
had
reached
in
its
dictum
in
youngblood.
and
so,
by
the
time
the
carlsons
purchase
this
property
in
1960,
it
seems
to
us
it
was
clear
enough
that
there
was
a
problem
and
we
don't
say
that
the
law
was
clear.
we
do
say
that
there
was
confusion
and
we
think
this
confusion
was
recognized
by
title
searchers
in
michigan
and
that
is
the
reason
why
they
accepted
from
the
abstract
to
get
themselves
off
the
hook
from
federal
filings.
all
of
these
reasons
we
think
undercut
the
argument
that
the
carlsons
made
that
they
justifiably
relied
on
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
think
it
would,
but
respondents
tell
us
that
everybody
did
it
the
other
way
and
nobody
paid
attention
to
the
federal
filings.
our
position
here
is
where
they
are
asking
that
union
central
be
applied
prospectively
only
is
it
they
have
to
show
some
real
justifiable
reliance
to
warrant
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
applied
by
this
court
that
its
decisions
apply
retrospectively
as
well
as
prospectively
and
we
don't
think
they
have.
indeed,
the
mortgagee
in
the
union
central
case
was
in
precisely
the
same
position
as
the
carlsons
where
here.
they
couldn't
have
known
that
youngblood
was
going
to
be
discredited
by
this
court,
but
there
is
no
hint
in
mr.
justice
black's
opinion
that
that
decision
was
to
be
prospective
only.
regarding
this
question
of
prospectiveness
versus
retroactivity,
we
have
reviewed
the
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
either
the
district
court
your
honor
or
locally
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
for
all
practical
purposes,
although
at
some
of
more
complicated
as
almost
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
now.
there
have
been
several
amendments
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
eh
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
ah
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
it
was
changed
in
august
of
1956
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
--
at
which
time,
michigan
adopted
the
uniform
tax
lien
registration
act.
in
addition
to
the
justifiable
reliance
point,
the
court
in
its
decision
in
the
linkletter
case
and
the
progeny
of
that
case
largely
in
the
criminal
area
in
deciding
whether
decision
should
be
applied
prospectively
only
or
retroactively.
and
more
recently
in
cipriano
against
city
of
houma,
voting
rights
case,
have
looked
to
three
factors
to
determine
whether
the
decision
should
be
retroactive
or
not.
the
first
as
we
have
mentioned
is
justifiable
reliance
and
for
the
reasons
i've
outlined,
we
don't
think
that
the
carlsons
could
have
justifiably
relied.
the
second
factor
is
whether
the
purpose
of
the
new
rule
would
be
frustrated,
if
the
decision
were
applied
prospectively
only.
and
here,
we
think
it
would
because
as
a
result
of
the
change
in
the
michigan
law
to
which
mr.
justice
stewart
referred,
there
will
be
no
other
cases
probably
that
govern
by
union
central
and
union
central
will
stand
by
itself
as
one
and
only
decision
having
no
application
outside
of
its
four
corners.
finally,
the
court
has
looked
to
whether
the
affect
of
holding
a
decision
prospective
in
the
criminal
area
whether
the
affect
of
that
would
impair
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
analogy
here
is
what
it
would
do
to
other
federal
tax
liens
and
again
as
i've
noted
it,
it
would
cast
cloud
on
some
40,000
of
them.
so
for
all
of
these
reasons,
we
don't
think
union
central
can
be
considered
a
prospective
only
decision
that
it
is
clearly
governing
here.
the
same
law
was
construed
by
this
court,
only
eight
years
ago,
and
it
was
held
not
to
authorize
a
federal
filing.
i
might
add
that
the
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
when
did
the
first
--
yes
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
the
early
--
one
of
the
earliest
cases
would
be
the
georgia
--
chicot
county
case,
but
as
i
say,
i
think
that
since
linkletter
in
1965,
the
courts
been
faced
with
the
series
of
problems,
largely
in
the
criminal
area
but
more
recently
in
cipriano
against
city
of
houma.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
oh,
yes.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
but
the
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that's
true
your
honor.
but
that
case,
it
seems
to
us
was
a
largely
based
on
considerations
of
res
judicata,
the
parties
and
interest
there
having
themselves
litigated
the
case,
whereas
here
the
carlsons
admitted
they
where
not
parties
to
the
union
central
decision.
and
we
don't
think
that
the
considerations
are
all
the
same,
and
in
any
event,
we
don't
think
the
reliance
was
justifiable
for
the
reasons
i've
outlined.
i
might
say
that
the
carlsons
did
have
a
terrible
problem
here,
but
so
does
the
internal
revenue
service
in
filing
in
his
liens.
in
the
maniaci
case
which
was
decided
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
1940,
the
united
states
filed
its
lien
both
federally
and
locally,
and
its
interest
was
still
held
subordinate
to
the
interest
of
a
subsequent
bona
fide
purchaser.
in
union
central,
in
youngblood
rather,
it
tried
to
file
its
notice
federally
and
it
was
held
that
it
was
not
entitled
to
file
its
notice
federally
and
here
again,
it
has
done
so.
the
sixth
circuit,
it
seems
to
us
has
held
that
no
matter
what
the
united
states
does
to
file
a
federal
tax
lien,
whether
it
would
be
local
or
federal,
it
cannot
prevail.
the
court
below
--
the
district
court
in
addition
to
relying
on
its
prospectivity
argument
also
found
that
union
central
was
distinguishable.
it
said
that
there
was
an
unsuccessful
filing
attempt
in
the
union
central
case
with
the
local
register
of
deeds.
that
is
not
the
case
so
far
as
the
opinion
of
this
court
and
the
record
show,
although
it
was
stipulated
in
that
case,
that
the
oakland
county
register
of
deeds
had
a
policy
of
not
accepting
non-descriptive
federal
filings.
the
point
the
district
court
seems
to
make
is
that
had
the
united
states'
attempted
to
file
federally
or
locally,
it
would
have
been
accepted
by
the
register
of
deeds
here,
and
therefore
this
would
have
given
notice
to
the
carlsons.
we
don't
know
if
that's
the
case
or
not
because
the
united
states
did
file
a
non-descriptive
notice
in
maniaci
and
it
was
held
that
the
subsequent
purchases
nevertheless
prevail.
moreover,
the
law
as
expounded
by
the
michigan
attorney
general
in
1953
in
his
decision
that
federal
non-descriptive
notices
were
not
entitled
to
be
filed
locally
was
nothing
new.
if
i
may
quote
from
the
decision
in
youngblood
in
1944,
?no
ambiguity
in
here
is
in
the
michigan
statute.
its
mandate
that
the
notice
of
lien
shall
contain
a
description
of
the
land
is
unmistakable
and
the
authority
of
the
register
of
deeds,
a
ministerial
officer,
is
clearly
limited
to
the
recordation
of
only
such
notices
of
united
states
tax
liens
as
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
statute.
?
this
is
what
the
sixth
circuit
held
in
1944,
and
this
is
what
the
attorney
general
held
in
his
opinion
in
1953.
it
was
nothing
new.
the
question
is
not
whether
a
local
register
of
deeds
would
or
would
not
have
accepted
a
non-descriptive
federal
filing.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
in
wayne
county,
michigan,
yes.
yes,
we
did.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
it
was.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
apparently
contrary
to
what
the
clear
law
of
michigan
was
as
construed
by
this
court
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
youngblood
case.
but
the
point
is
that
whether
a
filing
would
or
would
not
have
been
accepted
is
not
the
issue.
the
question
is
whether
the
local
law
authorized
a
filing
on
the
basis
and
on
the
conditions
that
the
michigan
statute
plainly
imposed
and
that
question
was
answered
by
this
court
in
the
union
central
case,
in
the
negative.
we
think
that
union
central
is
controlling
here
and
that
the
judgment
below
must
therefore
be
reversed
on
the
authority
of
union
central.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
it
does.
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
may
it
please
the
court,
just
two
or
three
brief
points.
first,
here
that
the
respondents
are
asking
that
a
decision
of
this
court
be
applied
prospectively
only.
they
point
to
the
fact
that
the
united
states
filed
locally
in
wayne
county
in
1950
and
locally
in
genesee
in
livingston
county
in
1960.
this
is
the
case.
the
law
was
confused,
but
the
respondents
are
the
ones
that
are
asking
that
it'd
applied
prospectively
only,
and
contrary
to
what
the
district
court
said
on
page
56
of
the
record,
the
next
to
last
line,
it
says,
prior
to
that
decision
referring
to
this
court's
decision
in
union
central,
there
was
no
indication
that
such
statute
would
be
declared
per
se
illegal.
on
the
contrary,
every
indication
was
that
the
statute
would
be
upheld.
we
have
outlined
previously
that
it
was
not
just
a
law
review
article
in
1952
pointing
out
the
problem,
glass
city
bank
and
youngblood
cannot
stand
together.
that
was
the
decision
of
this
court,
and
that
should
have
put
on
notice,
reasonable
purchasers
of
property
and
others
in
michigan.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
youngblood,
decided
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
1944,
and
holding
that
a
description
--
no,
and
glass
city
bank.
because
glass
city
bank
said
that
the
united
states
lien
applies
to
after
acquired
property,
and
there
is
no
way
who
describe
that
for
acquired
property
in
a
notice
because
we
don't
know
what
that
property
is
going
to
be.
respondents
seek
to
support
the
judgment
below
on
the
ground
that
the
united
states
should
have
refiled
in
1960
after
michigan
had
passed
the
uniform
tax
lien
registration
act
in
1956.
with
regard
to
that,
i
think
that
the
differences
between
this
court's
views
and
that
of
the
sixth
circuit
are
made
quite
clear.
with
reference
to
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion
in
the
faulk
case
which
has
pending
on
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari
in
number
844,
and
the
statement
of
mr.
justice
black's
in
the
union
central
case.
in
order
for
the
united
states
to
re-file,
every
time
a
delinquent
taxpayer
acquires
property
afterwards
it
has
to
follow
that
taxpayer
around
and
keep
tabs
on
him.
now
in
the
faulk
case
which
is
quoted
on
page
13
of
respondent's
brief,
the
sixth
circuit
said
?some
government
scrutiny
of
the
affairs
of
delinquent
taxpayers
sufficient
to
enable
it,
to
know
where
to
properly
file
notice
of
lien?
seem
to
have
been
contemplated
by
this
entire
statutory
scheme.
requiring
the
government
to
investigate
the
affairs
of
the
delinquent
taxpayer
to
determine
to
what
property
the
statutory
lien
attaches
and
therefore,
where
to
properly
file
the
required
notice
of
lien
in
no
way
cuts
down
on
the
broad
scope
of
the
lien.
that
is
not
the
case
and
that
is
to
be
compared
with
the
statement
of
mr.
justice
black,
368
u.s.
294
and
?it
seems
obvious
that
this
expansive
protection
for
the
government,
that
is
the
protection
that
its
lien
runs
to
after
acquired
property
would
be
greatly
reduced
if
to
enforce
it,
government
agents
were
compelled
to
keep
aware
at
all
times
of
all
property
coming
into
the
hands
of
its
tax
delinquents.?
the
sixth
circuit
has
been
out
of
steps
since
the
maniaci
case
in
1940.
united
states
filed
both
locally
and
federally
in
that
case
and
it
lost.
it
attempted
to
file
locally
in
youngblood
and
it
lost.
union
central
is
controlling
here
and
there's
no
basis
for
a
prospective
only
holding.
