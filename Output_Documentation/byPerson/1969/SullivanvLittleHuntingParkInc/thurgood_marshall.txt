to
the
trial
judge
about
all
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
did
he
also
note
that
you
objected
to
all
of
these?
if
so,
where?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
now
say
you
were
prejudice
to
all
about
these?
did
this
interfere
with
your
preparation
of
the
defense
to
this
appeal,
how?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
did
that
hurt
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
the
record
does
show
that
you
did
have
the
record.
the
judge
says
you
had
the
record,
you
could
see
it
in
his
office
that's
what
he
said,
didn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
on
friday
afternoon
or
monday?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
this
the
whole
record
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
ask
for
more
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
he
should
keep
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
you
just
did
because
he
told
you
to
do
it?
or
is
it
the
truth
with
the
matter
is
that
you
show
up
to
have
this
real
good
technicality
you
didn't
have
to
anymore?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
then
you
weren't
hurt
then,
were
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
have
plenty
time.
i
mean,
how
were
you
hurt
by
not
seeing
the
record
except
over
a
weekend?
is
there
anything
in
this
record
that's
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
in
that
hurt
of
case
that
must
be
corrected?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
so
extensive.
you
can't
point
to
one
instance.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
were
given
those?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
harris,
why
did
they
deny
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
just
--
can
i
say
it's
just
color?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
you
need
more
members?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
traced
that
he's
a
negro.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
because
he
is
a
negro?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
all
i
want
to
hear
and
then
i
want
to
say
what
right
should
they
have
to
do?
what
right
could
they
have
to
deny
the
man
privileges
as
a
result
of
connection
with
real
property
on
the
basis
of
race
alone?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
read
that
it
don't
need
alone
what
we
have
got.
justice
thurgood
marshall
webster
somebody
you
gave
a
minute
ago
said
club
means
a
whole
lot
of
things.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
no
magic
can
the
word
“club”
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
a
place
where
everybody
else
who
does
exact
same
thing
that
dr.
freeman
does
gets
into
this
recreations
center,
is
that
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
everybody
else
gets
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
else
got
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
one?
has
the
(voice
overlap)
record
shows
possibly
once
before
it
happens?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
say
this
right
which
--
do
you
admit
this
right
is
connected
with
property?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
not
as
it
answer
is
it
or
is
it
not
to
make
it
deprive.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
would
it
get
other
than
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
club.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
did
they
get
the
legal
right
from?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
let's
take
it
this
way.
suppose
the
whole
community
out
there
was
labeled
a
club,
would
you
say
a
negro
couldn't
buy
in
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean
they
called
it
club.
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
position
is
that
anything
that's
labeled
a
club
can
discriminate
against
people
because
of
race,
solely
because
they
call
it
a
club?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
do
you
limit
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who
was
ever
rejected
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
go
ahead.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
do
you
think
that
is
the
state
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
how
do
you
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
he'd
have
to
show
he's
a
stinker.
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
all
of
these,
and
i
am
sorry,
in
his
experience
he
was
refused
and
he
admitted
having
been
refused
solely
because
he
was
a
negro,
you
said
that,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
he'd
been
white,
they
could
accept
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
i
am
asking
is
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
doesn't
the
federal
statute
say
an
act
should
be
that
law
or
in
equity?
you
can
see
it
in
statute,
doesn't
it
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
have
been
cases
from
other
civil
rights
that
damages
had
been
awarded
by
this
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
submit
them
all
right
with
one.
