ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
for
the
second
time
having
been
here
previously
on
order
of
this
court
granting
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
at
the
same.
at
same
time
is
which
the
court
vacated
the
judgment
of
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
and
remanded
the
proceeding
to
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
for
further
consideration
in
light
of
the
case
of
jones
against
alfred
h.
mayer
company.
that
was
in
the
1967
term
of
the
court.
last
year,
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
after
we
seek
of
this
court's
mandate
refused
to
accept
the
remand
to
reconsider
the
case
in
light
of
the
mayer
case
and
issued
an
opinion
indicating
that
it
would
not
take
the
case
back
for
the
same
reason
that
it
refuse
to
entertain
the
appeals
on
the
first
occasion.
the
reason
stated
being
petitioners
alleged
failure
to
comply
with
certain
procedural
rule
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals.
the
court
indicated
that
it
did
not
had
jurisdiction
over
the
proceeding
in
the
first
instance
and
that
therefore
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
accept
the
remand.
we
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
court
--
the
case
is
now
here
again
on
the
court's
granting
of
this
second
petition.
by
granting
the
first
petition
for
certiorari,
the
court
impliedly
held
that
the
nonfederal
ground
of
decision
for
the
state
court
with
the
nonfederal
ground
upon
which
the
state
court
decided
the
case
was
inadequate
to
support
the
judgment
and
that
the
federal
question
should
therefore
be
examined.
the
state
court
by
failing
to
accept
the
remand,
by
failing
to
comply
with
this
court's
mandate,
we
submit
has
fail
to
observe
its
responsibilities
under
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution.
we
are
now
before
the
court
with
the
case
on
the
merits.
the
case
--
the
principal
issues
in
the
case
concern
the
matter
of
whether
a
community
recreation
association
may
engage
in
racially
discriminatory
policies
and
practices
within
the
--
under
the
proscriptions
contained
of
the
1866
--
civil
rights
act
of
1866
which
this
court
construed
in
jones
against
alfred
mayer
company.
and
whether
also
those
racially
discriminatory
practices
are
banned
or
prohibited
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
second
question
--
major
question
that
is,
is
whether
a
party
was
a
member
of
this
local
recreation
association
and
dissents
from
its
policies
may
consonant
with
the
protections
afforded
by
the
1866
law
in
the
constitution
be
expelled
for
his
dissent.
briefly,
the
facts
are
that
little
hunting
park
incorporated
is
a
nonstop
corporation
organized
under
the
virginia
law
for
the
purpose
of
providing
a
community
recreation
facility.
it
has
a
swimming
pool,
tennis
courts
and
a
park
and
picnic
area.
the
bylaws
has
provide
that
its
facilities
are
available
and
membership
is
available
to
anyone
living
within
prescribed
neighborhood,
a
prescribed
geographic
area
consisting
of
four
real
estate
subdivisions
plus
such
adjacent
areas
or
additional
areas
as
the
board
of
directors
might
decide.
the
membership
in
the
association
is
obtained
by
the
purchase
or
assignment
of
shares.
shares
maybe
purchase
for
a
sum
of
money
and
they
may
also
be
obtained
upon
assignment
from
landlord
to
tenant,
these
are
provisions
of
the
bylaws.
there
is
a
limit
of
600
shares
in
the
association
and
the
record
shows
that
in
the
history
of
this
association's
existence
namely
from
1955
to
1965
--
excuse
me,
1965
to
1966
when
the
trial
was
held.
shares
had
been
uniformly
permitted
that
is
assignment
and
transfer
of
shares
have
been
uniformly
permitted
by
the
board
of
directors
of
the
association
all
such
purchases
and
assignments
of
shares
being
subject
to
approval.
the
only
occasion
for
an
the
assignment
or
refusal
to
permit
an
assignment
having
occurred
at
the
time
of
the
incidents
which
are
alleged
to
herein
to
be
the
basis
for
this
action
namely
the
refusal
to
permit
the
assignment
from
the
one
pool
of
sullivan,
to
dr.
theodore
freeman
because
of
the
latter's
race
--
the
--
dr.
freeman
being
a
negro.
the
situation
involving
these
two
parties
came
about
as
follows:
mr.
sullivan,
a
white
man
had
owned
property
in
the
neighborhood
covered
by
the
bylaws
of
the
association
and
in
1955
or
1954
when
the
association
have
been
formed
had
purchased
a
share
which
he
used
so
long
as
he
live
in
a
house
on
condor
road
in
fairfax
county,
virginia.
he,
after
11
years,
moved
to
another
house
as
part
of
the
purchase
price
of
the
second
house
purchased
a
second
share
in
the
association.
in
the
meantime,
he
continued
to
rent
the
first
property
and
as
part
of
the
lease
made
a
practice
of
assigning
the
share
in
the
association
that
he'd
purchased
as
to
accompany
the
first
piece
of
property
of
the
first
house.
so,
mr.
sullivan
owned
two
shares,
he
owned
two
houses,
the
first
house
he
rented
out.
in
1965,
rented
the
first
house
to
dr.
freeman
and
as
part
of
the
lease
provided
for
the
assignment
of
the
share
in
the
association
it
went
along
with
that
property.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
no,
this
was
not,
he
would
have
three
prior
tenants
and
on
one
and
he
had
made
a
practice
of
assigning
the
swimming
--
or
the
association
membership
share
and
at
least
the
record
shows
that
share
has
always
been
--
the
assignments
had
always
been
approved
by
the
board
of
directors.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
no,
there
is
no
question
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
so
far
as
i
know,
there
is
no
such
claim
sir.
there
was
a
suggestion
of
this
raised
in
the
opposition
to
the
first
petition
for
certiorari
or
maybe
it
was
a
second
petition
and
we
filed
a
responds
to
that
pointing
out
the
point
--
the
place
is
in
the
record
showing
conclusively
that
race
was
the
reason
for
the
disapproval
of
the
membership
assignment
and
the
issue
has
not
been
raised
now
in
respondent's
brief.
as
a
result
of
mr.
sullivan's
disappointment
with
the
failure
of
the
association
board
of
directors
to
approve
this
assignment
to
dr.
freeman,
mr.
sullivan
sought
to
find
out
why
the
assignment
had
not
been
approved
and
he
sought
to
within
the
association
work
out
means
within
the
neighborhood
where
this
had
occurred,
he
sought
to
bring
about
a
reversal
of
the
--
what
he
thought
to
be
a
discriminatory
refusal
to
approve
this
assignment.
as
a
result
of
his
activities
with
among,
both
within
the
association
and
among
persons
in
the
neighborhood
such
as
leaders
in
the
church,
other
community
leaders,
the
association
board
of
directors
expelled
mr.
sullivan.
the
two
actions
here
seek:
one,
relief
mr.
sullivan,
we
seek
his
reinstatement
into
the
association
and
damages
for
the
injury
that
he
has
suffered
by
as
a
result
of
the
expulsion;
and
secondly,
we
seek
a
--
damages
for
dr.
freeman.
dr.
freeman
is
no
longer
in
the
county,
is
no
longer
in
the
neighborhood,
no
longer
lives
in
the
neighborhood
served
by
the
association
and
although
an
injunctive
remedy
maybe
a
future
value
to
him
that
it
is
of
no
immediate
value
because
he
doesn't
live
there
and
we
seek
damages
on
his
behalf
for
the
discrimination
that
he
suffered.
we
think
there
is
little
doubt
but
what
the
1866
civil
rights
act
which
this
court
construed
in
jones
against
mayer
applies
to
this,
to
the
facts
of
this
case
that
the
provisions
of
law
involved
are
contained
presently
in
42
u.s.c
sections
1981
and
1982.
the
section
1981
grants
negroes
the
same
rights
as
white
persons
to
make
an
enforce
contracts.
section
1982,
provide
negroes
--
grants
negroes
the
same
right
as
white
persons
to
inherit
purchase
and
lease,
real
and
personal
property.
the
--
we
have
shown,
the
record
shows
that
the
--
both
of
these
provisions
of
the
law
are
relevant
here.
there
was
a
contract
between
mr.
sullivan
and
dr.
freeman
which
provided
for
the
assignment
of
the
share
involved
and
the
board
of
directors
of
the
association
refused
to
permit
the
consummation
of
that
--
or
the
performance
of
that
contract
because
of
the
race
of
dr.
freeman.
the
--
so
that
would
make
section
1981
applicable
on
its
face,
section
1982
of
42
u.s.c.
we
believe
is
applicable
under
the
--
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
shares
of
the
membership
share
here
is
a
personal
property
and
the
membership
share
also
constitutes
and
membership
in
the
association
constitutes
an
incident
of
the
real
property
and
it
indeed
it
was
a
part
of
the
lease
hold
interest
that
dr.
freeman
obtained
from
mr.
sullivan.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
certain
to
that
if
--
i
just
don't
know
the
answer
sir.
when
we
started
this
action
because
this
court
had
not
yet
construed
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866,
we
press
in
addition
a
constitutional
basis
for
our
case.
under
this
court's
decision
in
evans
versus
newton,
we
felt
that
this
association
perform
the
same
function
as
bakers
field
park
which
was
at
issue
in
the
evans
against
newton
case
namely
that
it
was
a
public
facility
which
provided
public
recreation
and
that
it
had
all
of
the
attributes
of
a
public
facility
of
the
sort
that
were
at
issue
in
evans
against
newton.
we
still
would
continue
to
press
this
as
an
alternative
ground
for
a
decision.
as
far
as
dr.
freeman
is
concerned,
we
think
that
both
the
1866
law
and
constitutional
provisions
warrant
his
obtaining
relief.
as
far
as
mr.
sullivan
is
concerned,
the
record
shows
that
he
was
expelled
from
this
association
essentially
for
dissenting
from
its
racially
discriminatory
policy.
he,
under
the
law,
was
required
to
deal
with
dr.
freeman
on
a
nondiscriminatory
basis.
when
he
sought
to
do
so,
his
action
was
frustrated,
it
was
thwarted
and
when
he
sought
to
reverse
the
action
of
the
board
of
directors
and
engaged
in
legitimate
means
of
dissent
or
legitimate
means
to
try
and
reverse
the
board
of
directors'
action,
he
was
expelled,
he
was
punished,
the
action
was
retaliatory,
it
was
by
way
of
reprisal
and
we
indeed
feel
that
this
action
may
not
be
permitted
to
stand
under
relevant
authorities.
the
case
that's
most
analogous
is
that
of
barrows
versus
jackson,
which
is
discussed
in
our
brief
and
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
united
states.
there,
you
will
recall
that
a
party
who
had
failed
to
comply
with
a
discriminatory
racial
covenant
was
sued
for
damages
and
this
court
held
that
he
could
rely
on
--
that
he
could
defend
by
relying
on
the
constitutional
right
of
the
negro
who
was
involved
that
the
law
protected
him
in
those
circumstances.
we
think
that
the
circumstances
here
are
certainly
analogous.
the
--
we
have
reviewed
in
our
brief
the
various
charges
that
were
brought
against
mr.
sullivan
as
the
alleged
basis
for
his
discharge
--
excuse
me,
the
alleged
basis
for
his
expulsion.
we
have
demonstrated,
i
believe,
that
his
expulsion
was
that
there
were
whole
series
of
charges
that
were
brought
against
him
that
were
in
the
nature
of
exaggerations
and
some
instances
alleged
outright
falsehood.
all
of
which
served
the
purpose
of
which
serves
the
pretext
for
the
--
to
mask
the
hostility
that
the,
and
resentment
that
the
directors
of
this
association
felt
against
him
first
for
creating
this
controversy
by
attempting
to
assign
his
membership
to
a
negro
and
then
by
not
accepting
the
decision
which
they
had
made
to
deny
the
negro
of
the
assignment.
the
--
an
important
aspect
of
the
case
which
i've
not
cared
to
over
look
and
i'd
like
to
deal
with
for
moment
if
i
may,
concerns
the
matter
of
damages.
in
a
supplemental
brief
that
we
filed,
we
attempted
to
response
to
the
point
which
the
government
had
made
in
its
amicus
curiae
brief
namely
that
the
plaintiffs
here
may
not
be
entitled
to
punitive
damages
because
the
acts
involved
occurred
before
this
court
had
construed
the
1866
law
in
jones
against
mayer.
we,
i
think,
have
responded
to
that
in
a
sense
of
showing
that
punitive
damages
are
not
foreclosed
merely
because
the
action
took
what
the
acts
took
place
before
the
resurrection
of
the
1866
law.
the
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
this
and
i
did
not
cover
this
in
our
brief
because,
frankly,
the
--
what
i
am
about
to
say
had
not
quite
jelled
in
my
mind
at
the
time
i
wrote
the
supplemental
brief.
and
that
is
that
we
feel
that
there
is
a
right
established
on
this
record
by
both
parties
to
compensatory
damages
for
the
injuries
that
they
have
suffered.
we
think
also
that
they
are
both
entitled
to
punitive
damages
and
we
think
that
this
is
an
important
part
of
the
case
primarily
in
the
case
of
dr.
freeman
because
he
is
not
in
this
country
any
longer.he
is
how
with
the
united
states
embassy
in
tokyo.
the
question
of
punitive
damages,
i
think,
as
far
as
mr.
sullivan
is
concerned
is
quite
well
shown
or
exploited
in
our
brief
and
we
showed
it
on
the
record.
his
expulsion
from
the
association
was
motivated
by
attitudes
of
hostility,
resentment,
a
desire
to
act
if
by
way
of
reprisal
against
him
because
of
what
he
had
done.
these
are
the
elements
of
malice
or
these
are
the
elements
that
constitute
malice
and
which
are
basis
for
assessing
punitive
damages
as
far
as
mr.
sullivan
is
concerned.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
that's
correct
sir.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
we
left
the
question
undecided,
sir
and
there's
--
i
must
say
there's
a
somewhat,
with
all
due
respect,
there
is
somewhat
a
footnote
in
that
case,
it's
little
hard
to
understand.
but,
in
which
it
suggested
that
the
parties
may
not
have
on
those
pleadings
made
that
a
case
warranting
punitive
damages.
now,
we
when
we
ask
for
punitive,
we've
have
asked
for
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
all
the
way
along
here.
and
the
thing
that
i
want
to
indicate
is
that
in
the
case
of
dr.
freeman,
there
are
no
facts
it
might
appear
from
the
record
which
would
warrant
punitive
damages.
but
i
would
submit
that
he
was
the
victim
of
racial
discrimination
and
that
racial
discrimination
as
a
matter
of
law
warrants
the
imposition
of
punitive
damages.
race
discrimination
is
unjustified,
race
discriminations
cannot
be
rationalize
to
the
law.
race
discrimination
is
based
on
hatred,
prejudice,
bias,
it
has
no
justification
as
it
comes
a
matter
of
the
employing
malice.
there's
malice
in
law,
there
is
implied
malice.
these
are
recognized
in
other
fields
of
the
law
and
we
submit
that
when
a
person
is
the
victim
of
racial
discrimination,
there
is
implied
malice
and
that
punitive
damages
are
warranted.
we
feel
that
it's
particularly
important
here
to
--
in
this
respect
and
that
is
to
achieve
the
full
effectiveness
of
this
1866
act
that
the
court
would
be
well
warranted
in
giving
meaning
to
this
concept
of
punitive
damages.
there
is
indiligence
to
it
the
court
said
that
where
suddenly
protected
rights
have
been
invaded,
it
has
been
the
rule
from
the
beginning
that
the
courts
will
be
alert
to
adjust
their
remedies
so
as
to
grant
necessary
relief.
now,
this
case
is
probably
one
of
the
last
perhaps
sometime
that
will
come
before
the
court
involving
this
1866
act.
in
order
to
give
full
effect
to
this
law,
we
submit
that
punitive
damages
should
be
awarded
and
should
be
recognized
as
a
valid
remedy.
the
1964
civil
rights
act,
the
public
accommodation
provisions
of
it
have
no
damages
remedy
attached.
there
is
only
injunctive
relief
that
is
allowed.
since,
if
damages
are
allotted
at
all
here,
it
seems
to
me,
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
spell
out
both
the
right
of
a
party
to
obtain
both
the
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
and
as
i
say
where
punitive
--
where
discrimination
against
the
negro
occurs
for
no
other
reason
than
his
race
or
color
punitive
damage,
it's
an
inherently
malicious
act,
inherently
malicious
and
punitive
damages
should
be
awarded.
here,
it's
particularly
appropriate,
you
know,
because
the
court
--
the
board
of
directors
of
this
association
refused
repeatedly
to
ever
meet
dr.
freeman.
dr.
freeman
was
an
eminently
qualified
individual.
he
has
a
phd
degree
from
the
university
of
wisconsin.
he's
an
agricultural
economist.
he's
a
captain
in
the
district
columbia
national
guard.
he
had
eminent
qualifications,
they
never
met
him,
they
didn't
want
to
meet
him.
they
knew
he
was
black
and
that
was
enough.
that
is
malice
in
law
and
warrants
punitive
damages.
thank
you.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
the
fair
housing
act
in
1968
does
provide
for
damages.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
yes.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
yes,
there
are
two
provisions
by
which
judicial
relief
can
be
obtained
and
one
or
the
other,
as
i
recall,
provides
for
damages.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
i
am
sorry,
i
can't
i'm
not
certain
sir.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
i
would
simply
like
to
say
that
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
attributes
here
that
suggest
that
this
membership
in
this
association
maybe
an
incident
of
land
or
real
property.
i
would
point
out
that
there
are
several
factors,
for
example
the
bylaws
provide
that
shares
may
only
be
purchased
by
a
residence
in
specified
areas.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
no,
they
do
not.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
i'm
just
pointing
out
that
it
has
some
of
the
incidents
of
running
with
the
land.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
no,
they
do
not
automatically,
they
were
always
subject
tp
condition
of
approval
by
the
board,
is
that
what
you
mean?
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
well,
record
shows
that
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
well,
going
to
the
--
to
be
accept
that
we
pointed
it
out
on
page
seven
of
our
brief
that
there
had
been
1183
shares,
membership
shares
issued
in
this
corporation.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
yes
sir,
pages
125
to
126,
i
believe.
it's
on
page
seven
of
the
brief,
on
the
record
citations
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
only
the
--
the
record
only
suggest
as
mr.
harris
indicated
that
there
was
one
possible
rejection
at
one
time
because
there
is
no
indication
of
the
record
is
why
that
rejection
occurred.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record,
yes
that
people
who
do
not
belong
why
residence
in
those
areas
may
apply.
because
there
is
this
clause
which
provides
that
the
area
maybe
it's
sort
of
elastic.
it
can
be
extended
by
the
board
of
directors,
but
i
would
point
out
that
these
considerations
are
not
really
controlling,
that
is
the
elasticity
of
the
boundaries.
i
mean
under
section
1981
and
1982
of
42
u.s.c,
the
question
is,
do
we
have
the
incidents
of
a
contract
present
in
this
case?
do
we
have
the
incidents
or
either
personal
land
or
real
property?
and
the
fact
that
it
may
or
may
not
be
an
incident
of
real
property
alone
is
not
the
controlling
question.
i
would
like
to
mention
one
other
thing
or
two
or
three
other
things
rather.
one
thing
mr.
harris
suggested
that
if
damages
are
not
allowed,
dr.
freeman,
the
case
becomes
moot
because
he
is
not
entitled
with
injunctive
relief.
we
do
not
believe
that
is
so,
dr.
freeman
is
for
example
here
in
the
foreign
service
of
the
united
states.
he
can
return
to
this
area
at
any
time
and
he
should
be
entitled
to
injunctive
relief
to
prevent
future
recurrence
of
the
discrimination
if
he
should
move
back
into
one
of
the
house
for
example
that
he
lived
in
for
or
some
other
house
within
the
subdivision
neighborhood
served
by
this
association.
now,
one
very
important
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
it's
about
four
miles
south
of
there
--
sir
about
three
or
four
mile
south
near
fort
hunt
road
and
it's
about
half
way
between
hunting
towers
and
mt.
vernon
off
of
fort
hunt
road.
and
it's
in
the
area
that
is
surrounded
by
residential
areas
except
on
one
side,
it's
contiguous
to
a
school
yard.
the
bucknell
elementary
school,
a
public
school
is
contiguous
on
one
side
of
this
property.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
no,
bucknell.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
yes,
it
--
that's
correct
bucknell.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
well,
the
question
i
think
as
i
would
read
the
decisions
is
whether
the
state
court
denied
the
appeals
in
this
case
on
arbitrary
grounds.
if
it
was
acted
arbitrarily
and
unreasonably
not
just
did
it
misinterpreted
its
own
rule.
i
think,
i
maybe
wrong
on
this,
but
as
i
understand
that
the
court
will
inquire
into
the
reasonableness
of
the
interpretation
that
the
state
court
has
given
to
state
procedure.
and
we
believe
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
correct.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
that's
right,
that's
correct.
absolutely,
that
you
would
decide
the
case
on
the
merits
here
that
a
very
--
there
are
number
of
cases
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
on
this
issue.
now,
the
one
thing
that
we
feel
it
is
particularly
important
and
that
is
that
the
case
is
not
be
remanded
at
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
because
they
have
already
ruled
that
they
don't
have
jurisdiction
in
the
case.
and
we
have
pointed
out
for
example
the
case
in
our
brief,
the
case
of
naim
v.
naim
which
should
involve
a
test
that
the
virginia
anti-miscegenation
laws
where
the
virginia
supreme
court
under
the
circumstances
quite
comparable
to
this
refuse
to
accept
the
remand,
completely
frustrated
that
this
court's
mandate
by
failing
to
provide
the
kind
of
relief
to
the
court
had
directed
it
to
provide.
so,
we
submit
that
this
case
should
be
treated
as
one
being
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
circuit
court
of
fairfax
county
and
that
it
should
returned
to
the
circuit
court
of
fairfax
county
for
entry
of
a
decree
as
ordered
by
this
court
and
for
the
assessment
of
damages
of
that
being,
that
is
the
only
issue
and
that
it
should
go
directly
back
to
the
circuit
court
of
fairfax
county.
thank
you.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
refuse
to
accept
the
appeals
and
therefore
it's
no
different
in
a
situation
where
a
highest
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretionary
jurisdiction
decides
that
it
won't
review
the
case
and
that's
what
the
court
did
here
in
effect.
so
the
matter
--
there
are
no
further
matters
for
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
to
decide
once
this
court
has
answered
the
federal
issue
is
involve,
resolved
the
federal
is
involved
and
if
that
so
and
then
it
should
remanded
to
the
circuit
court
of
fairfax
county.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
so,
the
court
--
you
already
tried
to
do
that
once
with
all
due
regard
due
respect.
you
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
you
try
that
once
you
told
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
to
take
the
case
back
reconsider
it
on
the
merits
in
the
light
on
jones
versus
alfred
h.
mayer
company
and
that
court
refused
to
comply
with
this
court's
mandate.
now,
that
there
are
cases
in
this
court
reported
case
that
would
suggest
that
the
appropriate
remedy
and
such
an
instance
would
have
been
for
us
to
apply
for
a
writ
of
mandamus
against
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals,
we
do
not
do
that.
we
chose
this
method
of
seeking
review
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
court
and
have
urged
in
our
brief
that
this
court
decide
the
case
on
the
merits
and
we
think
that's
way
about
the
appropriate
thing
to
do
now.
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
has
already
violated
its
responsibilities
under
the
supremacy
clause
in
constitution.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
there
are
none
and
to
my
knowledge
in
the
subdivisions
listed
in
these
bylaws.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
private
or
public
neither.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
for
the
second
time
having
been
here
previously
on
order
of
this
court
granting
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
at
the
same.
at
same
time
is
which
the
court
vacated
the
judgment
of
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
and
remanded
the
proceeding
to
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
for
further
consideration
in
light
of
the
case
of
jones
against
alfred
h.
mayer
company.
that
was
in
the
1967
term
of
the
court.
last
year,
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
after
we
seek
of
this
court's
mandate
refused
to
accept
the
remand
to
reconsider
the
case
in
light
of
the
mayer
case
and
issued
an
opinion
indicating
that
it
would
not
take
the
case
back
for
the
same
reason
that
it
refuse
to
entertain
the
appeals
on
the
first
occasion.
the
reason
stated
being
petitioners
alleged
failure
to
comply
with
certain
procedural
rule
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals.
the
court
indicated
that
it
did
not
had
jurisdiction
over
the
proceeding
in
the
first
instance
and
that
therefore
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
accept
the
remand.
we
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
court
--
the
case
is
now
here
again
on
the
court's
granting
of
this
second
petition.
by
granting
the
first
petition
for
certiorari,
the
court
impliedly
held
that
the
nonfederal
ground
of
decision
for
the
state
court
with
the
nonfederal
ground
upon
which
the
state
court
decided
the
case
was
inadequate
to
support
the
judgment
and
that
the
federal
question
should
therefore
be
examined.
the
state
court
by
failing
to
accept
the
remand,
by
failing
to
comply
with
this
court's
mandate,
we
submit
has
fail
to
observe
its
responsibilities
under
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution.
we
are
now
before
the
court
with
the
case
on
the
merits.
the
case
--
the
principal
issues
in
the
case
concern
the
matter
of
whether
a
community
recreation
association
may
engage
in
racially
discriminatory
policies
and
practices
within
the
--
under
the
proscriptions
contained
of
the
1866
--
civil
rights
act
of
1866
which
this
court
construed
in
jones
against
alfred
mayer
company.
and
whether
also
those
racially
discriminatory
practices
are
banned
or
prohibited
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
second
question
--
major
question
that
is,
is
whether
a
party
was
a
member
of
this
local
recreation
association
and
dissents
from
its
policies
may
consonant
with
the
protections
afforded
by
the
1866
law
in
the
constitution
be
expelled
for
his
dissent.
briefly,
the
facts
are
that
little
hunting
park
incorporated
is
a
nonstop
corporation
organized
under
the
virginia
law
for
the
purpose
of
providing
a
community
recreation
facility.
it
has
a
swimming
pool,
tennis
courts
and
a
park
and
picnic
area.
the
bylaws
has
provide
that
its
facilities
are
available
and
membership
is
available
to
anyone
living
within
prescribed
neighborhood,
a
prescribed
geographic
area
consisting
of
four
real
estate
subdivisions
plus
such
adjacent
areas
or
additional
areas
as
the
board
of
directors
might
decide.
the
membership
in
the
association
is
obtained
by
the
purchase
or
assignment
of
shares.
shares
maybe
purchase
for
a
sum
of
money
and
they
may
also
be
obtained
upon
assignment
from
landlord
to
tenant,
these
are
provisions
of
the
bylaws.
there
is
a
limit
of
600
shares
in
the
association
and
the
record
shows
that
in
the
history
of
this
association's
existence
namely
from
1955
to
1965
--
excuse
me,
1965
to
1966
when
the
trial
was
held.
shares
had
been
uniformly
permitted
that
is
assignment
and
transfer
of
shares
have
been
uniformly
permitted
by
the
board
of
directors
of
the
association
all
such
purchases
and
assignments
of
shares
being
subject
to
approval.
the
only
occasion
for
an
the
assignment
or
refusal
to
permit
an
assignment
having
occurred
at
the
time
of
the
incidents
which
are
alleged
to
herein
to
be
the
basis
for
this
action
namely
the
refusal
to
permit
the
assignment
from
the
one
pool
of
sullivan,
to
dr.
theodore
freeman
because
of
the
latter's
race
--
the
--
dr.
freeman
being
a
negro.
the
situation
involving
these
two
parties
came
about
as
follows:
mr.
sullivan,
a
white
man
had
owned
property
in
the
neighborhood
covered
by
the
bylaws
of
the
association
and
in
1955
or
1954
when
the
association
have
been
formed
had
purchased
a
share
which
he
used
so
long
as
he
live
in
a
house
on
condor
road
in
fairfax
county,
virginia.
he,
after
11
years,
moved
to
another
house
as
part
of
the
purchase
price
of
the
second
house
purchased
a
second
share
in
the
association.
in
the
meantime,
he
continued
to
rent
the
first
property
and
as
part
of
the
lease
made
a
practice
of
assigning
the
share
in
the
association
that
he'd
purchased
as
to
accompany
the
first
piece
of
property
of
the
first
house.
so,
mr.
sullivan
owned
two
shares,
he
owned
two
houses,
the
first
house
he
rented
out.
in
1965,
rented
the
first
house
to
dr.
freeman
and
as
part
of
the
lease
provided
for
the
assignment
of
the
share
in
the
association
it
went
along
with
that
property.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
no,
this
was
not,
he
would
have
three
prior
tenants
and
on
one
and
he
had
made
a
practice
of
assigning
the
swimming
--
or
the
association
membership
share
and
at
least
the
record
shows
that
share
has
always
been
--
the
assignments
had
always
been
approved
by
the
board
of
directors.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
no,
there
is
no
question
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
so
far
as
i
know,
there
is
no
such
claim
sir.
there
was
a
suggestion
of
this
raised
in
the
opposition
to
the
first
petition
for
certiorari
or
maybe
it
was
a
second
petition
and
we
filed
a
responds
to
that
pointing
out
the
point
--
the
place
is
in
the
record
showing
conclusively
that
race
was
the
reason
for
the
disapproval
of
the
membership
assignment
and
the
issue
has
not
been
raised
now
in
respondent's
brief.
as
a
result
of
mr.
sullivan's
disappointment
with
the
failure
of
the
association
board
of
directors
to
approve
this
assignment
to
dr.
freeman,
mr.
sullivan
sought
to
find
out
why
the
assignment
had
not
been
approved
and
he
sought
to
within
the
association
work
out
means
within
the
neighborhood
where
this
had
occurred,
he
sought
to
bring
about
a
reversal
of
the
--
what
he
thought
to
be
a
discriminatory
refusal
to
approve
this
assignment.
as
a
result
of
his
activities
with
among,
both
within
the
association
and
among
persons
in
the
neighborhood
such
as
leaders
in
the
church,
other
community
leaders,
the
association
board
of
directors
expelled
mr.
sullivan.
the
two
actions
here
seek:
one,
relief
mr.
sullivan,
we
seek
his
reinstatement
into
the
association
and
damages
for
the
injury
that
he
has
suffered
by
as
a
result
of
the
expulsion;
and
secondly,
we
seek
a
--
damages
for
dr.
freeman.
dr.
freeman
is
no
longer
in
the
county,
is
no
longer
in
the
neighborhood,
no
longer
lives
in
the
neighborhood
served
by
the
association
and
although
an
injunctive
remedy
maybe
a
future
value
to
him
that
it
is
of
no
immediate
value
because
he
doesn't
live
there
and
we
seek
damages
on
his
behalf
for
the
discrimination
that
he
suffered.
we
think
there
is
little
doubt
but
what
the
1866
civil
rights
act
which
this
court
construed
in
jones
against
mayer
applies
to
this,
to
the
facts
of
this
case
that
the
provisions
of
law
involved
are
contained
presently
in
42
u.s.c
sections
1981
and
1982.
the
section
1981
grants
negroes
the
same
rights
as
white
persons
to
make
an
enforce
contracts.
section
1982,
provide
negroes
--
grants
negroes
the
same
right
as
white
persons
to
inherit
purchase
and
lease,
real
and
personal
property.
the
--
we
have
shown,
the
record
shows
that
the
--
both
of
these
provisions
of
the
law
are
relevant
here.
there
was
a
contract
between
mr.
sullivan
and
dr.
freeman
which
provided
for
the
assignment
of
the
share
involved
and
the
board
of
directors
of
the
association
refused
to
permit
the
consummation
of
that
--
or
the
performance
of
that
contract
because
of
the
race
of
dr.
freeman.
the
--
so
that
would
make
section
1981
applicable
on
its
face,
section
1982
of
42
u.s.c.
we
believe
is
applicable
under
the
--
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
shares
of
the
membership
share
here
is
a
personal
property
and
the
membership
share
also
constitutes
and
membership
in
the
association
constitutes
an
incident
of
the
real
property
and
it
indeed
it
was
a
part
of
the
lease
hold
interest
that
dr.
freeman
obtained
from
mr.
sullivan.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
certain
to
that
if
--
i
just
don't
know
the
answer
sir.
when
we
started
this
action
because
this
court
had
not
yet
construed
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866,
we
press
in
addition
a
constitutional
basis
for
our
case.
under
this
court's
decision
in
evans
versus
newton,
we
felt
that
this
association
perform
the
same
function
as
bakers
field
park
which
was
at
issue
in
the
evans
against
newton
case
namely
that
it
was
a
public
facility
which
provided
public
recreation
and
that
it
had
all
of
the
attributes
of
a
public
facility
of
the
sort
that
were
at
issue
in
evans
against
newton.
we
still
would
continue
to
press
this
as
an
alternative
ground
for
a
decision.
as
far
as
dr.
freeman
is
concerned,
we
think
that
both
the
1866
law
and
constitutional
provisions
warrant
his
obtaining
relief.
as
far
as
mr.
sullivan
is
concerned,
the
record
shows
that
he
was
expelled
from
this
association
essentially
for
dissenting
from
its
racially
discriminatory
policy.
he,
under
the
law,
was
required
to
deal
with
dr.
freeman
on
a
nondiscriminatory
basis.
when
he
sought
to
do
so,
his
action
was
frustrated,
it
was
thwarted
and
when
he
sought
to
reverse
the
action
of
the
board
of
directors
and
engaged
in
legitimate
means
of
dissent
or
legitimate
means
to
try
and
reverse
the
board
of
directors'
action,
he
was
expelled,
he
was
punished,
the
action
was
retaliatory,
it
was
by
way
of
reprisal
and
we
indeed
feel
that
this
action
may
not
be
permitted
to
stand
under
relevant
authorities.
the
case
that's
most
analogous
is
that
of
barrows
versus
jackson,
which
is
discussed
in
our
brief
and
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
united
states.
there,
you
will
recall
that
a
party
who
had
failed
to
comply
with
a
discriminatory
racial
covenant
was
sued
for
damages
and
this
court
held
that
he
could
rely
on
--
that
he
could
defend
by
relying
on
the
constitutional
right
of
the
negro
who
was
involved
that
the
law
protected
him
in
those
circumstances.
we
think
that
the
circumstances
here
are
certainly
analogous.
the
--
we
have
reviewed
in
our
brief
the
various
charges
that
were
brought
against
mr.
sullivan
as
the
alleged
basis
for
his
discharge
--
excuse
me,
the
alleged
basis
for
his
expulsion.
we
have
demonstrated,
i
believe,
that
his
expulsion
was
that
there
were
whole
series
of
charges
that
were
brought
against
him
that
were
in
the
nature
of
exaggerations
and
some
instances
alleged
outright
falsehood.
all
of
which
served
the
purpose
of
which
serves
the
pretext
for
the
--
to
mask
the
hostility
that
the,
and
resentment
that
the
directors
of
this
association
felt
against
him
first
for
creating
this
controversy
by
attempting
to
assign
his
membership
to
a
negro
and
then
by
not
accepting
the
decision
which
they
had
made
to
deny
the
negro
of
the
assignment.
the
--
an
important
aspect
of
the
case
which
i've
not
cared
to
over
look
and
i'd
like
to
deal
with
for
moment
if
i
may,
concerns
the
matter
of
damages.
in
a
supplemental
brief
that
we
filed,
we
attempted
to
response
to
the
point
which
the
government
had
made
in
its
amicus
curiae
brief
namely
that
the
plaintiffs
here
may
not
be
entitled
to
punitive
damages
because
the
acts
involved
occurred
before
this
court
had
construed
the
1866
law
in
jones
against
mayer.
we,
i
think,
have
responded
to
that
in
a
sense
of
showing
that
punitive
damages
are
not
foreclosed
merely
because
the
action
took
what
the
acts
took
place
before
the
resurrection
of
the
1866
law.
the
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
this
and
i
did
not
cover
this
in
our
brief
because,
frankly,
the
--
what
i
am
about
to
say
had
not
quite
jelled
in
my
mind
at
the
time
i
wrote
the
supplemental
brief.
and
that
is
that
we
feel
that
there
is
a
right
established
on
this
record
by
both
parties
to
compensatory
damages
for
the
injuries
that
they
have
suffered.
we
think
also
that
they
are
both
entitled
to
punitive
damages
and
we
think
that
this
is
an
important
part
of
the
case
primarily
in
the
case
of
dr.
freeman
because
he
is
not
in
this
country
any
longer.he
is
how
with
the
united
states
embassy
in
tokyo.
the
question
of
punitive
damages,
i
think,
as
far
as
mr.
sullivan
is
concerned
is
quite
well
shown
or
exploited
in
our
brief
and
we
showed
it
on
the
record.
his
expulsion
from
the
association
was
motivated
by
attitudes
of
hostility,
resentment,
a
desire
to
act
if
by
way
of
reprisal
against
him
because
of
what
he
had
done.
these
are
the
elements
of
malice
or
these
are
the
elements
that
constitute
malice
and
which
are
basis
for
assessing
punitive
damages
as
far
as
mr.
sullivan
is
concerned.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
that's
correct
sir.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
we
left
the
question
undecided,
sir
and
there's
--
i
must
say
there's
a
somewhat,
with
all
due
respect,
there
is
somewhat
a
footnote
in
that
case,
it's
little
hard
to
understand.
but,
in
which
it
suggested
that
the
parties
may
not
have
on
those
pleadings
made
that
a
case
warranting
punitive
damages.
now,
we
when
we
ask
for
punitive,
we've
have
asked
for
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
all
the
way
along
here.
and
the
thing
that
i
want
to
indicate
is
that
in
the
case
of
dr.
freeman,
there
are
no
facts
it
might
appear
from
the
record
which
would
warrant
punitive
damages.
but
i
would
submit
that
he
was
the
victim
of
racial
discrimination
and
that
racial
discrimination
as
a
matter
of
law
warrants
the
imposition
of
punitive
damages.
race
discrimination
is
unjustified,
race
discriminations
cannot
be
rationalize
to
the
law.
race
discrimination
is
based
on
hatred,
prejudice,
bias,
it
has
no
justification
as
it
comes
a
matter
of
the
employing
malice.
there's
malice
in
law,
there
is
implied
malice.
these
are
recognized
in
other
fields
of
the
law
and
we
submit
that
when
a
person
is
the
victim
of
racial
discrimination,
there
is
implied
malice
and
that
punitive
damages
are
warranted.
we
feel
that
it's
particularly
important
here
to
--
in
this
respect
and
that
is
to
achieve
the
full
effectiveness
of
this
1866
act
that
the
court
would
be
well
warranted
in
giving
meaning
to
this
concept
of
punitive
damages.
there
is
indiligence
to
it
the
court
said
that
where
suddenly
protected
rights
have
been
invaded,
it
has
been
the
rule
from
the
beginning
that
the
courts
will
be
alert
to
adjust
their
remedies
so
as
to
grant
necessary
relief.
now,
this
case
is
probably
one
of
the
last
perhaps
sometime
that
will
come
before
the
court
involving
this
1866
act.
in
order
to
give
full
effect
to
this
law,
we
submit
that
punitive
damages
should
be
awarded
and
should
be
recognized
as
a
valid
remedy.
the
1964
civil
rights
act,
the
public
accommodation
provisions
of
it
have
no
damages
remedy
attached.
there
is
only
injunctive
relief
that
is
allowed.
since,
if
damages
are
allotted
at
all
here,
it
seems
to
me,
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
spell
out
both
the
right
of
a
party
to
obtain
both
the
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
and
as
i
say
where
punitive
--
where
discrimination
against
the
negro
occurs
for
no
other
reason
than
his
race
or
color
punitive
damage,
it's
an
inherently
malicious
act,
inherently
malicious
and
punitive
damages
should
be
awarded.
here,
it's
particularly
appropriate,
you
know,
because
the
court
--
the
board
of
directors
of
this
association
refused
repeatedly
to
ever
meet
dr.
freeman.
dr.
freeman
was
an
eminently
qualified
individual.
he
has
a
phd
degree
from
the
university
of
wisconsin.
he's
an
agricultural
economist.
he's
a
captain
in
the
district
columbia
national
guard.
he
had
eminent
qualifications,
they
never
met
him,
they
didn't
want
to
meet
him.
they
knew
he
was
black
and
that
was
enough.
that
is
malice
in
law
and
warrants
punitive
damages.
thank
you.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
the
fair
housing
act
in
1968
does
provide
for
damages.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
yes.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
yes,
there
are
two
provisions
by
which
judicial
relief
can
be
obtained
and
one
or
the
other,
as
i
recall,
provides
for
damages.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
i
am
sorry,
i
can't
i'm
not
certain
sir.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
i
would
simply
like
to
say
that
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
attributes
here
that
suggest
that
this
membership
in
this
association
maybe
an
incident
of
land
or
real
property.
i
would
point
out
that
there
are
several
factors,
for
example
the
bylaws
provide
that
shares
may
only
be
purchased
by
a
residence
in
specified
areas.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
no,
they
do
not.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
i'm
just
pointing
out
that
it
has
some
of
the
incidents
of
running
with
the
land.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
no,
they
do
not
automatically,
they
were
always
subject
tp
condition
of
approval
by
the
board,
is
that
what
you
mean?
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
well,
record
shows
that
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
well,
going
to
the
--
to
be
accept
that
we
pointed
it
out
on
page
seven
of
our
brief
that
there
had
been
1183
shares,
membership
shares
issued
in
this
corporation.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
yes
sir,
pages
125
to
126,
i
believe.
it's
on
page
seven
of
the
brief,
on
the
record
citations
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
only
the
--
the
record
only
suggest
as
mr.
harris
indicated
that
there
was
one
possible
rejection
at
one
time
because
there
is
no
indication
of
the
record
is
why
that
rejection
occurred.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record,
yes
that
people
who
do
not
belong
why
residence
in
those
areas
may
apply.
because
there
is
this
clause
which
provides
that
the
area
maybe
it's
sort
of
elastic.
it
can
be
extended
by
the
board
of
directors,
but
i
would
point
out
that
these
considerations
are
not
really
controlling,
that
is
the
elasticity
of
the
boundaries.
i
mean
under
section
1981
and
1982
of
42
u.s.c,
the
question
is,
do
we
have
the
incidents
of
a
contract
present
in
this
case?
do
we
have
the
incidents
or
either
personal
land
or
real
property?
and
the
fact
that
it
may
or
may
not
be
an
incident
of
real
property
alone
is
not
the
controlling
question.
i
would
like
to
mention
one
other
thing
or
two
or
three
other
things
rather.
one
thing
mr.
harris
suggested
that
if
damages
are
not
allowed,
dr.
freeman,
the
case
becomes
moot
because
he
is
not
entitled
with
injunctive
relief.
we
do
not
believe
that
is
so,
dr.
freeman
is
for
example
here
in
the
foreign
service
of
the
united
states.
he
can
return
to
this
area
at
any
time
and
he
should
be
entitled
to
injunctive
relief
to
prevent
future
recurrence
of
the
discrimination
if
he
should
move
back
into
one
of
the
house
for
example
that
he
lived
in
for
or
some
other
house
within
the
subdivision
neighborhood
served
by
this
association.
now,
one
very
important
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
it's
about
four
miles
south
of
there
--
sir
about
three
or
four
mile
south
near
fort
hunt
road
and
it's
about
half
way
between
hunting
towers
and
mt.
vernon
off
of
fort
hunt
road.
and
it's
in
the
area
that
is
surrounded
by
residential
areas
except
on
one
side,
it's
contiguous
to
a
school
yard.
the
bucknell
elementary
school,
a
public
school
is
contiguous
on
one
side
of
this
property.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
no,
bucknell.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
yes,
it
--
that's
correct
bucknell.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
well,
the
question
i
think
as
i
would
read
the
decisions
is
whether
the
state
court
denied
the
appeals
in
this
case
on
arbitrary
grounds.
if
it
was
acted
arbitrarily
and
unreasonably
not
just
did
it
misinterpreted
its
own
rule.
i
think,
i
maybe
wrong
on
this,
but
as
i
understand
that
the
court
will
inquire
into
the
reasonableness
of
the
interpretation
that
the
state
court
has
given
to
state
procedure.
and
we
believe
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
correct.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
that's
right,
that's
correct.
absolutely,
that
you
would
decide
the
case
on
the
merits
here
that
a
very
--
there
are
number
of
cases
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
on
this
issue.
now,
the
one
thing
that
we
feel
it
is
particularly
important
and
that
is
that
the
case
is
not
be
remanded
at
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
because
they
have
already
ruled
that
they
don't
have
jurisdiction
in
the
case.
and
we
have
pointed
out
for
example
the
case
in
our
brief,
the
case
of
naim
v.
naim
which
should
involve
a
test
that
the
virginia
anti-miscegenation
laws
where
the
virginia
supreme
court
under
the
circumstances
quite
comparable
to
this
refuse
to
accept
the
remand,
completely
frustrated
that
this
court's
mandate
by
failing
to
provide
the
kind
of
relief
to
the
court
had
directed
it
to
provide.
so,
we
submit
that
this
case
should
be
treated
as
one
being
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
circuit
court
of
fairfax
county
and
that
it
should
returned
to
the
circuit
court
of
fairfax
county
for
entry
of
a
decree
as
ordered
by
this
court
and
for
the
assessment
of
damages
of
that
being,
that
is
the
only
issue
and
that
it
should
go
directly
back
to
the
circuit
court
of
fairfax
county.
thank
you.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
refuse
to
accept
the
appeals
and
therefore
it's
no
different
in
a
situation
where
a
highest
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretionary
jurisdiction
decides
that
it
won't
review
the
case
and
that's
what
the
court
did
here
in
effect.
so
the
matter
--
there
are
no
further
matters
for
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
to
decide
once
this
court
has
answered
the
federal
issue
is
involve,
resolved
the
federal
is
involved
and
if
that
so
and
then
it
should
remanded
to
the
circuit
court
of
fairfax
county.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
so,
the
court
--
you
already
tried
to
do
that
once
with
all
due
regard
due
respect.
you
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
you
try
that
once
you
told
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
to
take
the
case
back
reconsider
it
on
the
merits
in
the
light
on
jones
versus
alfred
h.
mayer
company
and
that
court
refused
to
comply
with
this
court's
mandate.
now,
that
there
are
cases
in
this
court
reported
case
that
would
suggest
that
the
appropriate
remedy
and
such
an
instance
would
have
been
for
us
to
apply
for
a
writ
of
mandamus
against
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals,
we
do
not
do
that.
we
chose
this
method
of
seeking
review
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
court
and
have
urged
in
our
brief
that
this
court
decide
the
case
on
the
merits
and
we
think
that's
way
about
the
appropriate
thing
to
do
now.
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
has
already
violated
its
responsibilities
under
the
supremacy
clause
in
constitution.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
there
are
none
and
to
my
knowledge
in
the
subdivisions
listed
in
these
bylaws.
ms.
allison

private
or
public
neither.
