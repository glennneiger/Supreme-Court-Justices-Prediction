mr.
john
charles
harris
may
it
please
the
court.
the
rules
of
procedure
in
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
required
that
counsel
must
serve
the
transcript
on
the
serve
and
notice
on
the
opposing
counsel
as
to
the
tendering
of
transcript
and
give
him
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
examine
it.
and
on
the
basis
of
the
failure
in
this
particular
case
for
counsel
to
serve
need
with
an
adequate
notice,
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
refuse
to
hear
this
appeal.
now,
they
based
it
on
the
case
of
snead
versus
commonwealth
which
was
a
criminal
case
in
1959.
snead's
counsel
presented
the
transcript
30
minutes
before
--
to
the
counsel,
before
he
submitted
to
the
judge
for
certification
and
on
the
basis
of
this,
the
virginia
court
said
that
30
minutes
was
not
reasonable
and
therefore
since
it
was
not
reasonable
and
the
requirement
was
jurisdictional.
therefore,
they
would
not
hear
mr.
snead's
appeal.
mr.
snead
served
his
five
years
in
penitentiary.
now,
in
the
particular
case
that
we
have
here,
the
opposing
counsel
and
myself
received
notice
three
days
after
it
was
tendered.
one
week
later,
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
don't
deny
that,
i
received
a
telephone
call.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
received
a
telephone
call
saying
that
the
transcript
would
be
tendered
on
a
friday
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
on
a
friday,
a
telephone
call
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
june
the
9th,
on
the
12th,
that's
about
friday
afternoon
sometime
during
at
friday
afternoon.
and
i
understand
it
was
dropped
at
the
judge's
secretary's
desk.
the
judge
saw
it
on
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
that's
right
on
the
16th
is
when
i
received
that
the
transcript.
now,
of
course
the
virginia
court
construes
this
procedure
is
jurisdictional
that
it
isn't
up
to
me
as
in
cases
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
before
the
judge
signed
the
--
yes,
that
was
on
the
judge
sign
and
i
believe
some
after
the
16th.
mr.
john
charles
harris
right,
the
virginia
court
has
construed
this
is
not
my
responsibility
as
a
response
while
the
other
counsel
to
get
meeting
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
subsequently,
i
had
it
one
weekend.
in
fact,
i
think
i
had
it
for
nine
working
hours
to
examine
it.
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
but
i
--
it's
not
in
the
record
nor
isn't
in
the
record
that
i
had
it
for
nine
hours.
but
nine
hours
is
a
very
extensive
transcript
and
i
just
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
yes
i
did.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
didn't
--
again
looking
at
virginia
law,
i
think
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
put
each
one
of
these
items
in
the
record.
in
fact
the
trial
judge
said,
you
don't
have
to
worry,
i'm
going
to
note
everything
on
the
record
and
that's
all
you
have
to
do
and
this
is
what
he
did
and
said
i'm
going
to
note
on
the
record
exactly
when
i
receive
it
and
in
the
record,
there
is
a
notification
of
the
trial
judge
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
there
is
no
record
that
i
have
objected.
i
did
object
but
there
is
no
record
that
i
object.
mr.
john
charles
harris
because
i
was
waiting
for
service
to
be
made
on
the
--
i
was
waiting
for
transcript
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
well,
it
hurt
me
because
i
couldn't
--
we
didn't
have
the
record.
the
record
was
--(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
charles
harris
in
the
judge's
chambers.
mr.
john
charles
harris
until
on
16th,
i
believe
it
was
16th
i
got
on
the
friday
afternoon
to
return
it
on
monday.
mr.
john
charles
harris
friday
afternoon
and
return,
to
return
on
monday.
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
not
this
is
just
a
portion
of
it,
very
extensive.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i'm
certain
i
did,
i
raised
the
same
question
there
that
i
didn't
have
sufficient
time
to
read
this
extensive
record
and
at
that
particular
time,
mr.
brown
said
that
he
wanted
it
back
by
monday
and
i
used
his
copy
and
had
his
copy
back
on
monday
to
him.
mr.
john
charles
harris
because
it
was
already
given
back
to
him
on
monday.
mr.
john
charles
harris
now,
very
frankly
i
didn't.
i
was
incognizant
of
this
requirement
at
that
time,
i
wasn't
so
after
which.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
was
hurt
insofar
as
i
didn't
have
the
time
to
prepare
my
case.
mr.
john
charles
harris
the
purpose
of
us
getting
together
to
correct
the
record
was
to
correct
the
mistakes
and
i
think
in
the
record
there
is
a
statement
there
that
it
was
very
poorly
taken
and
it
needed
substantial
corrections.
and
this,
i
didn't
have
the
opportunity
to
correct.
mr.
john
charles
harris
it's
so
extensive,
i
don't
know
what
would
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
again,
that
my
argument
here
is
not
whether
i've
been
hurt
or
not
but
whether
the
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
is
right
in
saying
that
this
notice
must
be
given
and
its
jurisdictional
that
notice
must
be
given
beforehand.
whether
i've
been
hurt
or
not,
i
think
this
is
not
--
the
virginia
court
is
not
concern
whether
i
am
hurt
or
not.
mr.
john
charles
harris
well,
granted
to
that,
if
i
were
giving
sufficient
time,
it's
of
course
is
to
whether
virginia
has
the
right
to
say
that
notice
must
be
given
in
advance.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
gather
the
phone
calls
sometime
when
the
last
day,
i
don't
remember
what
is
all
about
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
charles
harris
as
i
remember,
i
got
telephone
calls
saying
i'm
going
to
get
that
over
to
the
judge's
chamber.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
expected
the
notice,
i
expect
a
notice.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
didn't
do
anything
because
i
expected
a
notice.
i
expected
the
law
will
be
fulfilled.
mr.
john
charles
harris
in
virginia?
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
had
to.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
have
to.
mr.
john
charles
harris
which
is
already
furnished,
which
the
virginia
court
considers
jurisdictional.
mr.
john
charles
harris
well,
the
jury
was
fair.
in
the
case
of
mr.
snead,
the
court
considered
the
jurisdictional
with
him
and
other
cases,
the
court
considered
it
jurisdictional.
now,
this
is
(voice
overlap)
on
the
court.
mr.
john
charles
harris
the
bolin
case
--(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
charles
harris
it
goes
back
to
the
code
section
prior
to
the
rule
of
the
court
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
every
case
that
i
have
seen
where
this
question
has
been
raised,
the
court
has
ruled
it
jurisdictional.
mr.
john
charles
harris
now,
on
this
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
these
particular
cases'
notice
was
given
but
the
question
was
sufficiency
of
the
notice.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
don't
know,
i
presume
it
was
written.
it
doesn't
say
in
here
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
alright,
going
on
to
the
1866,
title
1982,
i
consider
these
all
part
of
title
42
and
i
think
that
if
we
are
going
to
look
at
section
1982
of
title
42,
we
must
look
at
in
under
the
doctrine
of
pari
materia
or
construing
all
statutes
on
the
same
subject
together.
we
must
look
at
the
rest
of
title
42
including
that
section
which
is
known
as
a
public
accommodations
law.
and
this
provides
that
all
persons
shall
be
entitled
to
the
use
of
facilities.
provided
those
facilities
are
interstate
commerce,
the
segregation
in
those
facilities
are
enforced
by
the
state,
state
action.
and
also
it
excludes
from
the
operation
of
public
accommodations
law
any
establishment
which
is
not
in
fact
open
to
the
public,
also
it
excludes
clubs.
now,
in
the
transcript
is
a
rather
extensive
coverage
of
the
security
that
was
available
at
this
particular
establishment
to
keep
people
out.
and
the
thing
was
not
in
fact
open
to
the
public,
it
was
not
--
there
was
no
support
of
segregation
by
the
state.
in
fact,
the
defendants,
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
very
reluctantly
before
this
court,
they
were
brought
into
court.
they
didn't
ask
state
to
enforce
segregation.
in
addition,
we
contend
that
little
hunting
park
is
a
club.
now,
if
we're
contending
it
as
a
club,
we
have
to
know
what
a
club
means.
webster
defines
a
club
as
an
association
of
persons
for
some
common
object,
specially
one
jointly
supported
meaning
periodically.
now,
i
refer
to
black
maybe
for
legal
definition
and
black
says
a
word,
club
has
no
very
definite
meaning.
clubs
are
formed
for
also
its
purposes
and
there
was
no
uniformity
in
their
constitution
and
rules.
it
is
well
known
that
clubs
exist
which
limit
the
number
of
their
members
and
select
them
with
great
care
which
own
considerable
property
in
common
and
in
which
the
furnishing
of
food
and
drink
to
the
members
for
money
is
not
but
one
of
the
many
conveniences
with
the
members
--
which
the
members
enjoy.
now,
little
hunting
park
started
out
as
a
group
of
people
buying
land
and
putting
up
tennis
courts,
a
building,
swimming
pool
for
their
own
purpose
and
those
that
they
elected
to
join
them.
they
provided
in
their
bylaws,
they
setup
a
secured
charter
from
the
state
of
virginia.
and
in
this
charter,
they
use
the
word
community
and
this
is
a
basis
of
the
petitioner's
case
as
a
fact
for
the
use
of
word
“community.”
and
looking
at
webster's
definition
of
community,
community
as
we
think
of
now
the
community
meaning
a
public
that
was
a
second
definition,
the
community
is
a
community
of
interest.
at
the
same
time
they
drafted
bylaws
and
the
bylaws
say
that
they
are
operating
only
for
their
members.
and
if
they're
operating
only
for
the
members
that
cannot
be
open
to
the
public
or
it
cannot
be
a
community
organization.
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
the
provision
in
the
bylaws
is
this,
that
an
owner
and
i
presume
this
is
because
of
the
many
military
in
the
area
who
were
transferred.the
owner
may
assign
temporarily
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
board
of
directors
his
privileges
not
his
membership,
but
his
privileges.
he
may
allow
the
facilities
to
be
use
by
his
tenant
subject
to
the
approval
of
board
of
directors
and
this
is
what
happened
in
particular
case
here.
we
have
that
mr.
sullivan
who
owned
a
membership
in
the
particular
club
moot
and
when
moved
to
other
house,
he
bought
another
membership
and
assigned
them
at
the
privileges
of
his
membership
to
his
tenant
or
attempted
to
assign
that
the
privileges
of
membership
to
his
tenants
in
the
first
house.
mr.
john
charles
harris
yes,
but
the
record
will
show
that
not
only
one
of
three
--
two
times
before
i
understand,
only
one
time
that
he
transferred
the
privileges.
and
again
he
went
to
the
procedure
applying
to
the
board
of
directors
and
asking
the
board
of
directors,
will
you
prove
my
tenant
for
the
use
of
the
facilities
of
this
membership
and
they
did.
they
allowed
him
to
assign
his
membership.
mr.
john
charles
harris
it's
in
the
record,
it's
something
that
we
say
it
is
in
race
but
when
we
say
that
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
no.
but
we
can't
very
well
say
this
because
if
we
did
not
have
prejudice
among
us
today,
we
won't
have
any
need
for
the
civil
right
acts.
in
this
particular
case,
these
people
who
find
and
again
this
is
in
the
record,
they
find
that
their
membership
is
dropping.
as
their
membership
drops,
they
must
increase
to
do,
as
they
increase
the
do,
the
membership
drops
further.
now,
we
are
in
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
but
this
is
their
and
whether
right
or
wrong,
they
figured
with
a
negro
in
the
club,
they
would
lose
members.
now,
right
or
wrong
it
was
their
conclusion.
mr.
john
charles
harris
if
they
brought
him
in,
they
would
feel
that
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
that's
right,
that's
what
i
say,
it's
their
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
now,
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
would
say
this
and
i
think
that
as
far
if
we
are
talking
about
a
club,
if
it
is
club,
and
we
can
tie
this
beside
the
other
--
(voice
overlap)
country
clubs
which
are
here
in
communities.
mr.
john
charles
harris
that's
right.
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
there
is
no
definition
other
than
what
webster
says
as
far
as
i
am
concerned.
mr.
john
charles
harris
in
a
club
and
he
applied
from
membership
in
the
club.
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
no.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
understand
that
they
didn't
keep
records
of
anyone
who
is
declined
and
i
had
no
record
of
anyone
being
declined.
but
the
secretary
does
testify
in
here
that
shipping
members
of
the
declination.
now,
whether
he's
white
or
any
other
--
i
don't
know.
again,
i
am
not
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
possibly
once
before
it
happens
and
whether
he
was
a
negro
or
not
i
don't
know.
mr.
john
charles
harris
in
this
particular
case
if
it's
connected
with
property,
it
would've
been
connected
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
if
it's
connected
on
the
fourteenth
amendment,
shelley
versus
kraemer
says
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
any
restraint
on
property
is
between
the
party
but
the
court
cannot
enforce
it.
so,
if
it
is
connected
with
property,
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
would
say
no
in
my
opinion.
mr.
john
charles
harris
how
would
he
get
for
right
to
go
into
the
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
into
the
club
--
again
my
argument
is
not
moralist
because
i
am
not
a
moralist.
my
argument
is
law
and
i
think
that
i
may
feel
that
it's
perfectly
wrong
to
exclude
this
man.
but,
if
they
have
a
little
right
to
do
so,
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
because
there's
no
law
prohibiting
it.
a
club
is
always
had
the
right
to
select
their
members,
those
who
they
feel
compatible
with.
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
i
would
say
that
particular
case,
it
would
be
a
definite
restraint
on
the
purchase
of
property.
mr.
john
charles
harris
now,
as
far
as
this
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
very
definitely
not.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
think
that
a
club
is
what
we
know
as
a
club
if
in
this
particular
community
here,
85%
of
the
people
did
not
belong
to
this
particular
club
only
15%
of
this
particular
community
did
belong
to
the
club.
there
were
anyone
i
could
go
down
and
actually
apply
for
membership,
but
whether
we
would
be
accepted,
i
don't
know
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
don't
know.
i
can
only
go
by
the
record.(voice
overlap)
well,
one
was
--
if
i
may,
justice.
mr.
john
charles
harris
in
june,
i
think
i
believe
it
was
may
or
june
if
i
may
quote
you,
you
say
negro-americans
have
just
as
many
beautiful
people
in
mind
and
body
as
well
as
in
skin
as
any
other
group.
and
we
have
just
as
many
stinkers
as
any
other
group
and
i
could
agree
with
that
perfectly
but
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
what
suppose
that
he
is
suppose
the
only
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
suppose
that
we
do
have
a
stinker
who
happens
to
be
a
negro,
do
we
have
accept
him?
mr.
john
charles
harris
then
if
we
go
--
would
it
be
sufficient
for
us
to
determine
that
dr.
freeman
is
a
stinker
on
our
evidence
and
turn
him
out
of
the
club.
mr.
john
charles
harris
he
was
refused
because
when
economic
concern
by
the
board
of
directors
for
the
good
of
their
corporation.
mr.
john
charles
harris
probably,
i
don't
know.
i
really
--
i
am
not,
wasn't
a
member
of
the
board
and
i
have
never
been,
so
i
don't
know
what
they
would
determine.
mr.
john
charles
harris
it's
in
fairfax
county
your
honor,
in
an
area
known
as
the
bucknell
which
is
just
south
of
alexandria.
mr.
john
charles
harris
it's
a
club
insofar
as
these
people
didn't
get
together
and
built
a
club
house,
a
swimming
pool,
tennis
courts,
they
have
members,
they
delegated
to
the
board
of
directors
the
right
to
select
members
after
they
got
initial
members
in.
mr.
john
charles
harris
this
is
something
where
it
is
very
unique
and
it
isn't
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
there
is
no
buying
of
membership
with
a
house.
i
think
that
again
the
record
will
show
that
this
was
not
a
standard
procedure
where
a
man
will
sell
his
membership
to
his
tenant.
but,
what
they
did
is
in
starting
off
again
i
think
the
founders
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
houses.
the
only
thing
is
different
between
on
this
and
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
they
don't
know
any
houses.
mr.
john
charles
harris
nobody
owns
any
houses
as
far
down
there
as
far
as
--
and
the
except
for
the
individual
owners.
mr.
john
charles
harris
members
of
the
corporation
live
in,
members
of
the
club
live
in
the
houses
in
the
community.
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
in
this
particular
community,
only
15%
of
the
people
belong
to
the
club.
the
rest
do
not
belong
to
the
club,
they
may
belong
to
the
other
club
which
is
about
valley
high
country
club
or
they
may
belong
to
woodlawn
country
club.
but
in
this
particular
case,
is
15%
of
the
people
living
in
this
community.
now,
the
only
thing
it
makes
this
different
from
the
average
club
is
when
you
join
a
club,
a
country
club
for
swimming,
golf
whatever,
you
pay
an
initiation
fee.
now,
in
this
particular
case
and
this
is
unusual
but
it's
not
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
no
houses
involved,
you
don't
--
you
know
you
can
be
in
apartment
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
i
imagine
that
maybe
some
people
living
in
apartments
who
belong
to
this
club.
mr.
john
charles
harris
there's
no
apartments
in
the
community
that
i
know
of
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
don't
know,
i
believe
the
builder
it
was
guys
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
well,
is
a
rather
large
area
(voice
overlap)
20
and
30
builders.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
really
don't
know,
there
is
say
that
it's
the
land
was
originally
known
by
bucknell,
owned
by
bucknell
university
who
sold
off
land
to
builders
and
builders
came
in
to
build
houses.
mr.
john
charles
harris
yes,
it's
a
great
land
(voice
overlap)
regular
community.
pardon.
mr.
john
charles
harris
for
anybody
would
buy
them.
mr.
john
charles
harris
yes.
mr.
john
charles
harris
the
--
yes,
and
the
individual
members
who
don't
have
houses,
they
maybe
on
apartment
but
houses
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
club.
mr.
john
charles
harris
positively
not
other
than
the
fact
that
the
membership
privileges
membership,
they
would
allow
an
owner
and
the
purpose
of
this
was
if
an
owner
was
transferred
overseas
he
could
transfer
his
privileges
to
his
tenant
while
he
was
gone.
and
this
is
the
only
thing
and
this
is
what
--
this
is
the
procedure
that
they
are
bringing
up.
mr.
john
charles
harris
yes,
this
is
been
tried
in
the
county
court
and
a
county
court
ruled
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
the
appellate
court
hasn't
heard
it
because
of
the
procedure
involved.
mr.
john
charles
harris
certainly,
i
mean
if
you
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
yes,
i
think
that
if
we
would
manage
it
to
virginia
court.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
would
prefer
because
i
think
it
is
the
correct
thing
to
do.
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
it's
not
on
the
brief,
but
i
think
it
would
be
the
correcting
to
do
in
my
opinion.
alright,
now
mr.
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
that's
right
we
would.
i
guess
virginia
with
the
mandate
and
the
reason
why
they
were
--
it
was
remanded
to
them,
the
other
time
they
just
said
that
the
other
case
was
a
case
involving
a
sale
of
a
house
and
they
do
their
case
out
or
throughout
before
in
the
basis
of
procedure.
but,
there's
one
thing
as
far
as
the
mootness
of
this
question.
mr.
freeman
is
not
looking
for
any
admission
to
this
club,
he
is
looking
for
damages
and
if
he
is
not
entitle
to
damages,
then
the
question
is
moot
and
this
court
should
not
consider
moot
question,
so
i
understand.
but
if
the
only
way
he
can
get
in
my
opinion,
the
only
he
can
get
damages
is
under
1982.
and
if
1982
as
jones
versus
mayer
does
not
allow
damages
then
the
question
is
moot
as
far
as
criminal
is
concern.
he
is
on
pakistan
now,
he
is
not
asking
for
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
it
does
--
it
says
it
does
not.
mr.
john
charles
harris
okay,
it
makes
no
that
--
contains
no
provision
allowed
can
be
enforce
by
injunction
that
contains
no
provision
expressly
authorize
in
the
federal
court
order
the
payment
of
damages.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
am
really
--
i
am
not
familiar
with
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
but
if
i'm
going
to
back
to
the
public
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
under
the
public
accommodation
section
and
which
is
title
42
which
is
included
--
includes
1982.
in
there
and
of
course
mr.
brown
is
just
admitted
that
there
is
no
damages
under
the
public
accommodations
law.
it's
strictly
consolatory
and
there
is
a
provision
for
referral
to
a
mediation
service,
but
there
is
no
damages
under
the
public
accommodations
law
except
for
the
granting
of
counsel
fees.
now,
there's
also
an
error,
it
says
but
this
shown,
i
preclude
the
assertion
of
any
other
federal
state
law
or
federal
or
state
law
not
inconsistent.
and
if
we
look
at
the
charlotte
v.
(inaudible),
we'll
see
that
the
natural
application
was
an
assault
with
a
rule
that
there
was
no
provisions
--
no
damages
under
the
public
accommodations
law.
but
in
a
case
of
an
assault
in
connection
with
the
discrimination,
you
could
sue
for
damages
on
assault.
so
in
my
opinion,
there
is
no
provision
for
damages
under
1982
or
under
the
public
accommodation
section
to
the
civil
rights
act
and
this
is
what
you're
talking
about.
they
are
not
really
talking
about
land
because
if
they're
talking
about
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
then
unlawful
restriction
on
land,
then
we
did
not
enlist
the
aid
of
the
state
court
to
enforce
of
restrictive
covenant.
they
are
suing
us.
this
does
mean
that
all
you
have
to
do
to
bring
the
fourteenth
amendment
down
to
individuals
is
the
file
suit
against
that
individual.
and
the
barrows
versus
jackson
case,
it
was
a
question
of
the
court
coming
in,
calling
on
the
court
to
a
system
to
take
damages
against
someone
who
violate
and
restricted
of
covenant.
shelley
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
yes
you
would.
mr.
john
charles
harris
there
are
people
living
in
alexandria
and
i
believe
there
is,
i
am
not
sure
about
if
there
is
one
living
now
living
in
washington
dc.
again
it
would
be
rather
impractical
because
a
club
must
be
in
an
area
close
to
those
members
as
far
as
going
to
spokane,
to
white
bridge
--
this
would
a
little
silly.
you'd
have
to
have
your
bridge
club
in
here
and
a
reason
for
--
the
reason
why
we
don't
have
more
people
in
the
district
of
columbia
or
even
in
arlington
is
because
of
the
fact
that
it's
further
away,
it's
to
far
to
travel.
so,
but
probably
if
you
look
at
district
of
columbia
and
you
would
like
to
apply
why
i
think
you'd
have
a
good
chance
of
becoming
a
member.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
think
same
thing
was
replied
to
justice
marshall.
mr.
john
charles
harris
this
is
in
the
geographical
--
it's
a
rather
wide
area
with
geographical
limit
that
was
originally
put
in
there,
but
never
in
the
record
will
show
that
it
hasn't
or
actually
ever
adhere
to.
and
again
there's
one
thing
that's
left
off
there,
there
must
also
be
approve
by
the
board
of
directors
which
is
a
third
requirement.
mr.
john
charles
harris
may
it
please
the
court.
the
rules
of
procedure
in
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
required
that
counsel
must
serve
the
transcript
on
the
serve
and
notice
on
the
opposing
counsel
as
to
the
tendering
of
transcript
and
give
him
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
examine
it.
and
on
the
basis
of
the
failure
in
this
particular
case
for
counsel
to
serve
need
with
an
adequate
notice,
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
refuse
to
hear
this
appeal.
now,
they
based
it
on
the
case
of
snead
versus
commonwealth
which
was
a
criminal
case
in
1959.
snead's
counsel
presented
the
transcript
30
minutes
before
--
to
the
counsel,
before
he
submitted
to
the
judge
for
certification
and
on
the
basis
of
this,
the
virginia
court
said
that
30
minutes
was
not
reasonable
and
therefore
since
it
was
not
reasonable
and
the
requirement
was
jurisdictional.
therefore,
they
would
not
hear
mr.
snead's
appeal.
mr.
snead
served
his
five
years
in
penitentiary.
now,
in
the
particular
case
that
we
have
here,
the
opposing
counsel
and
myself
received
notice
three
days
after
it
was
tendered.
one
week
later,
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
don't
deny
that,
i
received
a
telephone
call.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
received
a
telephone
call
saying
that
the
transcript
would
be
tendered
on
a
friday
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
on
a
friday,
a
telephone
call
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
june
the
9th,
on
the
12th,
that's
about
friday
afternoon
sometime
during
at
friday
afternoon.
and
i
understand
it
was
dropped
at
the
judge's
secretary's
desk.
the
judge
saw
it
on
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
that's
right
on
the
16th
is
when
i
received
that
the
transcript.
now,
of
course
the
virginia
court
construes
this
procedure
is
jurisdictional
that
it
isn't
up
to
me
as
in
cases
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
before
the
judge
signed
the
--
yes,
that
was
on
the
judge
sign
and
i
believe
some
after
the
16th.
mr.
john
charles
harris
right,
the
virginia
court
has
construed
this
is
not
my
responsibility
as
a
response
while
the
other
counsel
to
get
meeting
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
subsequently,
i
had
it
one
weekend.
in
fact,
i
think
i
had
it
for
nine
working
hours
to
examine
it.
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
but
i
--
it's
not
in
the
record
nor
isn't
in
the
record
that
i
had
it
for
nine
hours.
but
nine
hours
is
a
very
extensive
transcript
and
i
just
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
yes
i
did.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
didn't
--
again
looking
at
virginia
law,
i
think
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
put
each
one
of
these
items
in
the
record.
in
fact
the
trial
judge
said,
you
don't
have
to
worry,
i'm
going
to
note
everything
on
the
record
and
that's
all
you
have
to
do
and
this
is
what
he
did
and
said
i'm
going
to
note
on
the
record
exactly
when
i
receive
it
and
in
the
record,
there
is
a
notification
of
the
trial
judge
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
there
is
no
record
that
i
have
objected.
i
did
object
but
there
is
no
record
that
i
object.
mr.
john
charles
harris
because
i
was
waiting
for
service
to
be
made
on
the
--
i
was
waiting
for
transcript
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
well,
it
hurt
me
because
i
couldn't
--
we
didn't
have
the
record.
the
record
was
--(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
charles
harris
in
the
judge's
chambers.
mr.
john
charles
harris
until
on
16th,
i
believe
it
was
16th
i
got
on
the
friday
afternoon
to
return
it
on
monday.
mr.
john
charles
harris
friday
afternoon
and
return,
to
return
on
monday.
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
not
this
is
just
a
portion
of
it,
very
extensive.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i'm
certain
i
did,
i
raised
the
same
question
there
that
i
didn't
have
sufficient
time
to
read
this
extensive
record
and
at
that
particular
time,
mr.
brown
said
that
he
wanted
it
back
by
monday
and
i
used
his
copy
and
had
his
copy
back
on
monday
to
him.
mr.
john
charles
harris
because
it
was
already
given
back
to
him
on
monday.
mr.
john
charles
harris
now,
very
frankly
i
didn't.
i
was
incognizant
of
this
requirement
at
that
time,
i
wasn't
so
after
which.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
was
hurt
insofar
as
i
didn't
have
the
time
to
prepare
my
case.
mr.
john
charles
harris
the
purpose
of
us
getting
together
to
correct
the
record
was
to
correct
the
mistakes
and
i
think
in
the
record
there
is
a
statement
there
that
it
was
very
poorly
taken
and
it
needed
substantial
corrections.
and
this,
i
didn't
have
the
opportunity
to
correct.
mr.
john
charles
harris
it's
so
extensive,
i
don't
know
what
would
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
again,
that
my
argument
here
is
not
whether
i've
been
hurt
or
not
but
whether
the
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
is
right
in
saying
that
this
notice
must
be
given
and
its
jurisdictional
that
notice
must
be
given
beforehand.
whether
i've
been
hurt
or
not,
i
think
this
is
not
--
the
virginia
court
is
not
concern
whether
i
am
hurt
or
not.
mr.
john
charles
harris
well,
granted
to
that,
if
i
were
giving
sufficient
time,
it's
of
course
is
to
whether
virginia
has
the
right
to
say
that
notice
must
be
given
in
advance.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
gather
the
phone
calls
sometime
when
the
last
day,
i
don't
remember
what
is
all
about
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
charles
harris
as
i
remember,
i
got
telephone
calls
saying
i'm
going
to
get
that
over
to
the
judge's
chamber.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
expected
the
notice,
i
expect
a
notice.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
didn't
do
anything
because
i
expected
a
notice.
i
expected
the
law
will
be
fulfilled.
mr.
john
charles
harris
in
virginia?
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
had
to.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
have
to.
mr.
john
charles
harris
which
is
already
furnished,
which
the
virginia
court
considers
jurisdictional.
mr.
john
charles
harris
well,
the
jury
was
fair.
in
the
case
of
mr.
snead,
the
court
considered
the
jurisdictional
with
him
and
other
cases,
the
court
considered
it
jurisdictional.
now,
this
is
(voice

on
the
court.
mr.
john
charles
harris
the
bolin
case
--(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
charles
harris
it
goes
back
to
the
code
section
prior
to
the
rule
of
the
court
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
every
case
that
i
have
seen
where
this
question
has
been
raised,
the
court
has
ruled
it
jurisdictional.
mr.
john
charles
harris
now,
on
this
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
these
particular
cases'
notice
was
given
but
the
question
was
sufficiency
of
the
notice.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
don't
know,
i
presume
it
was
written.
it
doesn't
say
in
here
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
alright,
going
on
to
the
1866,
title
1982,
i
consider
these
all
part
of
title
42
and
i
think
that
if
we
are
going
to
look
at
section
1982
of
title
42,
we
must
look
at
in
under
the
doctrine
of
pari
materia
or
construing
all
statutes
on
the
same
subject
together.
we
must
look
at
the
rest
of
title
42
including
that
section
which
is
known
as
a
public
accommodations
law.
and
this
provides
that
all
persons
shall
be
entitled
to
the
use
of
facilities.
provided
those
facilities
are
interstate
commerce,
the
segregation
in
those
facilities
are
enforced
by
the
state,
state
action.
and
also
it
excludes
from
the
operation
of
public
accommodations
law
any
establishment
which
is
not
in
fact
open
to
the
public,
also
it
excludes
clubs.
now,
in
the
transcript
is
a
rather
extensive
coverage
of
the
security
that
was
available
at
this
particular
establishment
to
keep
people
out.
and
the
thing
was
not
in
fact
open
to
the
public,
it
was
not
--
there
was
no
support
of
segregation
by
the
state.
in
fact,
the
defendants,
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
very
reluctantly
before
this
court,
they
were
brought
into
court.
they
didn't
ask
state
to
enforce
segregation.
in
addition,
we
contend
that
little
hunting
park
is
a
club.
now,
if
we're
contending
it
as
a
club,
we
have
to
know
what
a
club
means.
webster
defines
a
club
as
an
association
of
persons
for
some
common
object,
specially
one
jointly
supported
meaning
periodically.
now,
i
refer
to
black
maybe
for
legal
definition
and
black
says
a
word,
club
has
no
very
definite
meaning.
clubs
are
formed
for
also
its
purposes
and
there
was
no
uniformity
in
their
constitution
and
rules.
it
is
well
known
that
clubs
exist
which
limit
the
number
of
their
members
and
select
them
with
great
care
which
own
considerable
property
in
common
and
in
which
the
furnishing
of
food
and
drink
to
the
members
for
money
is
not
but
one
of
the
many
conveniences
with
the
members
--
which
the
members
enjoy.
now,
little
hunting
park
started
out
as
a
group
of
people
buying
land
and
putting
up
tennis
courts,
a
building,
swimming
pool
for
their
own
purpose
and
those
that
they
elected
to
join
them.
they
provided
in
their
bylaws,
they
setup
a
secured
charter
from
the
state
of
virginia.
and
in
this
charter,
they
use
the
word
community
and
this
is
a
basis
of
the
petitioner's
case
as
a
fact
for
the
use
of
word
“community.”
and
looking
at
webster's
definition
of
community,
community
as
we
think
of
now
the
community
meaning
a
public
that
was
a
second
definition,
the
community
is
a
community
of
interest.
at
the
same
time
they
drafted
bylaws
and
the
bylaws
say
that
they
are
operating
only
for
their
members.
and
if
they're
operating
only
for
the
members
that
cannot
be
open
to
the
public
or
it
cannot
be
a
community
organization.
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
the
provision
in
the
bylaws
is
this,
that
an
owner
and
i
presume
this
is
because
of
the
many
military
in
the
area
who
were
transferred.the
owner
may
assign
temporarily
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
board
of
directors
his
privileges
not
his
membership,
but
his
privileges.
he
may
allow
the
facilities
to
be
use
by
his
tenant
subject
to
the
approval
of
board
of
directors
and
this
is
what
happened
in
particular
case
here.
we
have
that
mr.
sullivan
who
owned
a
membership
in
the
particular
club
moot
and
when
moved
to
other
house,
he
bought
another
membership
and
assigned
them
at
the
privileges
of
his
membership
to
his
tenant
or
attempted
to
assign
that
the
privileges
of
membership
to
his
tenants
in
the
first
house.
mr.
john
charles
harris
yes,
but
the
record
will
show
that
not
only
one
of
three
--
two
times
before
i
understand,
only
one
time
that
he
transferred
the
privileges.
and
again
he
went
to
the
procedure
applying
to
the
board
of
directors
and
asking
the
board
of
directors,
will
you
prove
my
tenant
for
the
use
of
the
facilities
of
this
membership
and
they
did.
they
allowed
him
to
assign
his
membership.
mr.
john
charles
harris
it's
in
the
record,
it's
something
that
we
say
it
is
in
race
but
when
we
say
that
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
no.
but
we
can't
very
well
say
this
because
if
we
did
not
have
prejudice
among
us
today,
we
won't
have
any
need
for
the
civil
right
acts.
in
this
particular
case,
these
people
who
find
and
again
this
is
in
the
record,
they
find
that
their
membership
is
dropping.
as
their
membership
drops,
they
must
increase
to
do,
as
they
increase
the
do,
the
membership
drops
further.
now,
we
are
in
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
but
this
is
their
and
whether
right
or
wrong,
they
figured
with
a
negro
in
the
club,
they
would
lose
members.
now,
right
or
wrong
it
was
their
conclusion.
mr.
john
charles
harris
if
they
brought
him
in,
they
would
feel
that
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
that's
right,
that's
what
i
say,
it's
their
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
now,
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
would
say
this
and
i
think
that
as
far
if
we
are
talking
about
a
club,
if
it
is
club,
and
we
can
tie
this
beside
the
other
--
(voice
overlap)
country
clubs
which
are
here
in
communities.
mr.
john
charles
harris
that's
right.
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
there
is
no
definition
other
than
what
webster
says
as
far
as
i
am
concerned.
mr.
john
charles
harris
in
a
club
and
he
applied
from
membership
in
the
club.
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
no.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
understand
that
they
didn't
keep
records
of
anyone
who
is
declined
and
i
had
no
record
of
anyone
being
declined.
but
the
secretary
does
testify
in
here
that
shipping
members
of
the
declination.
now,
whether
he's
white
or
any
other
--
i
don't
know.
again,
i
am
not
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
possibly
once
before
it
happens
and
whether
he
was
a
negro
or
not
i
don't
know.
mr.
john
charles
harris
in
this
particular
case
if
it's
connected
with
property,
it
would've
been
connected
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
if
it's
connected
on
the
fourteenth
amendment,
shelley
versus
kraemer
says
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
any
restraint
on
property
is
between
the
party
but
the
court
cannot
enforce
it.
so,
if
it
is
connected
with
property,
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
would
say
no
in
my
opinion.
mr.
john
charles
harris
how
would
he
get
for
right
to
go
into
the
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
into
the
club
--
again
my
argument
is
not
moralist
because
i
am
not
a
moralist.
my
argument
is
law
and
i
think
that
i
may
feel
that
it's
perfectly
wrong
to
exclude
this
man.
but,
if
they
have
a
little
right
to
do
so,
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
because
there's
no
law
prohibiting
it.
a
club
is
always
had
the
right
to
select
their
members,
those
who
they
feel
compatible
with.
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
i
would
say
that
particular
case,
it
would
be
a
definite
restraint
on
the
purchase
of
property.
mr.
john
charles
harris
now,
as
far
as
this
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
very
definitely
not.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
think
that
a
club
is
what
we
know
as
a
club
if
in
this
particular
community
here,
85%
of
the
people
did
not
belong
to
this
particular
club
only
15%
of
this
particular
community
did
belong
to
the
club.
there
were
anyone
i
could
go
down
and
actually
apply
for
membership,
but
whether
we
would
be
accepted,
i
don't
know
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
don't
know.
i
can
only
go
by
the
record.(voice
overlap)
well,
one
was
--
if
i
may,
justice.
mr.
john
charles
harris
in
june,
i
think
i
believe
it
was
may
or
june
if
i
may
quote
you,
you
say
negro-americans
have
just
as
many
beautiful
people
in
mind
and
body
as
well
as
in
skin
as
any
other
group.
and
we
have
just
as
many
stinkers
as
any
other
group
and
i
could
agree
with
that
perfectly
but
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
what
suppose
that
he
is
suppose
the
only
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
suppose
that
we
do
have
a
stinker
who
happens
to
be
a
negro,
do
we
have
accept
him?
mr.
john
charles
harris
then
if
we
go
--
would
it
be
sufficient
for
us
to
determine
that
dr.
freeman
is
a
stinker
on
our
evidence
and
turn
him
out
of
the
club.
mr.
john
charles
harris
he
was
refused
because
when
economic
concern
by
the
board
of
directors
for
the
good
of
their
corporation.
mr.
john
charles
harris
probably,
i
don't
know.
i
really
--
i
am
not,
wasn't
a
member
of
the
board
and
i
have
never
been,
so
i
don't
know
what
they
would
determine.
mr.
john
charles
harris
it's
in
fairfax
county
your
honor,
in
an
area
known
as
the
bucknell
which
is
just
south
of
alexandria.
mr.
john
charles
harris
it's
a
club
insofar
as
these
people
didn't
get
together
and
built
a
club
house,
a
swimming
pool,
tennis
courts,
they
have
members,
they
delegated
to
the
board
of
directors
the
right
to
select
members
after
they
got
initial
members
in.
mr.
john
charles
harris
this
is
something
where
it
is
very
unique
and
it
isn't
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
there
is
no
buying
of
membership
with
a
house.
i
think
that
again
the
record
will
show
that
this
was
not
a
standard
procedure
where
a
man
will
sell
his
membership
to
his
tenant.
but,
what
they
did
is
in
starting
off
again
i
think
the
founders
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
houses.
the
only
thing
is
different
between
on
this
and
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
they
don't
know
any
houses.
mr.
john
charles
harris
nobody
owns
any
houses
as
far
down
there
as
far
as
--
and
the
except
for
the
individual
owners.
mr.
john
charles
harris
members
of
the
corporation
live
in,
members
of
the
club
live
in
the
houses
in
the
community.
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
in
this
particular
community,
only
15%
of
the
people
belong
to
the
club.
the
rest
do
not
belong
to
the
club,
they
may
belong
to
the
other
club
which
is
about
valley
high
country
club
or
they
may
belong
to
woodlawn
country
club.
but
in
this
particular
case,
is
15%
of
the
people
living
in
this
community.
now,
the
only
thing
it
makes
this
different
from
the
average
club
is
when
you
join
a
club,
a
country
club
for
swimming,
golf
whatever,
you
pay
an
initiation
fee.
now,
in
this
particular
case
and
this
is
unusual
but
it's
not
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
no
houses
involved,
you
don't
--
you
know
you
can
be
in
apartment
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
i
imagine
that
maybe
some
people
living
in
apartments
who
belong
to
this
club.
mr.
john
charles
harris
there's
no
apartments
in
the
community
that
i
know
of
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
don't
know,
i
believe
the
builder
it
was
guys
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
well,
is
a
rather
large
area
(voice
overlap)
20
and
30
builders.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
really
don't
know,
there
is
say
that
it's
the
land
was
originally
known
by
bucknell,
owned
by
bucknell
university
who
sold
off
land
to
builders
and
builders
came
in
to
build
houses.
mr.
john
charles
harris
yes,
it's
a
great
land
(voice
overlap)
regular
community.
pardon.
mr.
john
charles
harris
for
anybody
would
buy
them.
mr.
john
charles
harris
yes.
mr.
john
charles
harris
the
--
yes,
and
the
individual
members
who
don't
have
houses,
they
maybe
on
apartment
but
houses
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
club.
mr.
john
charles
harris
positively
not
other
than
the
fact
that
the
membership
privileges
membership,
they
would
allow
an
owner
and
the
purpose
of
this
was
if
an
owner
was
transferred
overseas
he
could
transfer
his
privileges
to
his
tenant
while
he
was
gone.
and
this
is
the
only
thing
and
this
is
what
--
this
is
the
procedure
that
they
are
bringing
up.
mr.
john
charles
harris
yes,
this
is
been
tried
in
the
county
court
and
a
county
court
ruled
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
the
appellate
court
hasn't
heard
it
because
of
the
procedure
involved.
mr.
john
charles
harris
certainly,
i
mean
if
you
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
yes,
i
think
that
if
we
would
manage
it
to
virginia
court.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
would
prefer
because
i
think
it
is
the
correct
thing
to
do.
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
it's
not
on
the
brief,
but
i
think
it
would
be
the
correcting
to
do
in
my
opinion.
alright,
now
mr.
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
that's
right
we
would.
i
guess
virginia
with
the
mandate
and
the
reason
why
they
were
--
it
was
remanded
to
them,
the
other
time
they
just
said
that
the
other
case
was
a
case
involving
a
sale
of
a
house
and
they
do
their
case
out
or
throughout
before
in
the
basis
of
procedure.
but,
there's
one
thing
as
far
as
the
mootness
of
this
question.
mr.
freeman
is
not
looking
for
any
admission
to
this
club,
he
is
looking
for
damages
and
if
he
is
not
entitle
to
damages,
then
the
question
is
moot
and
this
court
should
not
consider
moot
question,
so
i
understand.
but
if
the
only
way
he
can
get
in
my
opinion,
the
only
he
can
get
damages
is
under
1982.
and
if
1982
as
jones
versus
mayer
does
not
allow
damages
then
the
question
is
moot
as
far
as
criminal
is
concern.
he
is
on
pakistan
now,
he
is
not
asking
for
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
it
does
--
it
says
it
does
not.
mr.
john
charles
harris
okay,
it
makes
no
that
--
contains
no
provision
allowed
can
be
enforce
by
injunction
that
contains
no
provision
expressly
authorize
in
the
federal
court
order
the
payment
of
damages.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
am
really
--
i
am
not
familiar
with
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
but
if
i'm
going
to
back
to
the
public
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
under
the
public
accommodation
section
and
which
is
title
42
which
is
included
--
includes
1982.
in
there
and
of
course
mr.
brown
is
just
admitted
that
there
is
no
damages
under
the
public
accommodations
law.
it's
strictly
consolatory
and
there
is
a
provision
for
referral
to
a
mediation
service,
but
there
is
no
damages
under
the
public
accommodations
law
except
for
the
granting
of
counsel
fees.
now,
there's
also
an
error,
it
says
but
this
shown,
i
preclude
the
assertion
of
any
other
federal
state
law
or
federal
or
state
law
not
inconsistent.
and
if
we
look
at
the
charlotte
v.
(inaudible),
we'll
see
that
the
natural
application
was
an
assault
with
a
rule
that
there
was
no
provisions
--
no
damages
under
the
public
accommodations
law.
but
in
a
case
of
an
assault
in
connection
with
the
discrimination,
you
could
sue
for
damages
on
assault.
so
in
my
opinion,
there
is
no
provision
for
damages
under
1982
or
under
the
public
accommodation
section
to
the
civil
rights
act
and
this
is
what
you're
talking
about.
they
are
not
really
talking
about
land
because
if
they're
talking
about
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
then
unlawful
restriction
on
land,
then
we
did
not
enlist
the
aid
of
the
state
court
to
enforce
of
restrictive
covenant.
they
are
suing
us.
this
does
mean
that
all
you
have
to
do
to
bring
the
fourteenth
amendment
down
to
individuals
is
the
file
suit
against
that
individual.
and
the
barrows
versus
jackson
case,
it
was
a
question
of
the
court
coming
in,
calling
on
the
court
to
a
system
to
take
damages
against
someone
who
violate
and
restricted
of
covenant.

mr.
john
charles
harris
yes
you
would.
mr.
john
charles
harris
there
are
people
living
in
alexandria
and
i
believe
there
is,
i
am
not
sure
about
if
there
is
one
living
now
living
in
washington
dc.
again
it
would
be
rather
impractical
because
a
club
must
be
in
an
area
close
to
those
members
as
far
as
going
to
spokane,
to
white
bridge
--
this
would
a
little
silly.
you'd
have
to
have
your
bridge
club
in
here
and
a
reason
for
--
the
reason
why
we
don't
have
more
people
in
the
district
of
columbia
or
even
in
arlington
is
because
of
the
fact
that
it's
further
away,
it's
to
far
to
travel.
so,
but
probably
if
you
look
at
district
of
columbia
and
you
would
like
to
apply
why
i
think
you'd
have
a
good
chance
of
becoming
a
member.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
think
same
thing
was
replied
to
justice
marshall.
mr.
john
charles
harris
this
is
in
the
geographical
--
it's
a
rather
wide
area
with
geographical
limit
that
was
originally
put
in
there,
but
never
in
the
record
will
show
that
it
hasn't
or
actually
ever
adhere
to.
and
again
there's
one
thing
that's
left
off
there,
there
must
also
be
approve
by
the
board
of
directors
which
is
a
third
requirement.
