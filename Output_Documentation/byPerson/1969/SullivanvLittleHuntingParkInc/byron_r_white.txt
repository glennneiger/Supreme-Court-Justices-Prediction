justice

white
when
did
you
received
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
the
virginia
requirement
is
construed
by
the
virginia
court
is
double
barrel,
adequate
notice
of
the
time
and
place
of
tendering
and
inadequate
opportunity
to
examine.
i
don't
suppose
you
would
deny
you
have
an
adequate
opportunity
to
examine
this
record.
it
was
there
in
the
judge's
office
for
a
week,
you
could've
examined
it
and
you
had
the
weekend
to
examine
it.
you
say,
--
we
did
examine
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
didn't
complain
that
you
have
--
you
couldn't
make
an
adequate
examination
at
that
time,
would
you?
yes,
it
was
a
very
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
did?
where
does
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
always
considers
jurisdictional,
what
about
the
bolin
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
bolin
v.
laderberg,
didn't
seem
to
consider
it
jurisdictional
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
appreciate
that
but
the
requirement
that
must
be
in
writing
would
you
have
said
was
the
case
here
and
that
was
jurisdictional.
it
doesn't
seem
to
have
been
jurisdictional
in
every
case
in
which
they
considered
the
rule,
have
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what's
the
role
of
the
court
in
virginia
also.
so,
have
seven
virginia
and
another
67
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
those
--
they
don't
seem
to
consider
it
jurisdictional
under
all
circumstances.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
it
wasn't
written,
neither
of
those
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
mind
if
i
read
this
in
it
correctly.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
bylaws
don't
say
that
being
a
resident
in
the
area
is
the
only
qualification
for
membership.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
board
of
directors
still
has
to
pass
on
applications
for
membership
although
applications
according
to
bylaws
are
limited
to
residence.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
there
is
something
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
residents
of
these
areas,
specified
areas
automatically
qualified
for
membership?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
at
also
--
but
is
there
something
in
the
record
indicates
that
the
board
automatically
gave
approval
to
residents?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
perhaps
the
board
had
the
right
to
approve
them
but
does
the
record
shows
that
this
is
an
automatic
matter
residence
of
these
specified
areas
qualified
in
membership
without
more?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
there
ever
been
any
rejections?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
with
him
that
people
who
are
not
residents
of
these
specified
areas
may
apply
for
membership?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
consequences
if
we
don't
agree
for
the
state
court
what
we
would
say
is,
this
not
an
adequate
state
ground
and
we
didn't
get
to
the
merits
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
would
be
remand
it.
justice
byron
r.

could
i
ask
you
how
may
other
swimming
pools
there
are
in
the
subdivision
listed
in
the
bylaws?
justice
byron

private
