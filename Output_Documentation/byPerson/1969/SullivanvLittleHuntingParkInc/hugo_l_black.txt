didn't
you
but
one
in
writing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
writing,
isn't
that
right?
i
think
at
noticed
(voice
overlap).
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
only
thing
is
that
it
was
not
and
you
claim
was
not
in
writing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
any
objection
to
that
notice
except
that
it
was
not
in
writing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
suppose
we
will
reverse
the

down
in
virginia,
could
you
still
try
your
case
on
these
merits?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
could
or
couldn't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
only
objection
you
have
is
that
they
didn't
give
you
a
written
notice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
little
fair,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
this
club?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
how
do
you
say
--
why
do
you
say
it's
a
club
i
have
questioned
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
ordinarily
a
membership
is
not
bought
by
a
house.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
usally
pay
dues
to
go
to
a
club.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
they
organize
the
corporation
with
the
understanding
that
they
would
not
sell
any
houses
to
call
the
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
will
they
own
the
houses,
didn't
the
corporation
own
the
houses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
own
the
houses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
live
in
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
are
living
in
the
houses
because
they
are
members
of
the
club,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
to
buy
house
for
initiation
fee,
don't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
get
it
and
i
thought
what
you
said
that
he
got
each
one
of
that
house.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
community?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,

build
the
houses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
not
talking
about
who
actually
put
them
up.
who
own
them
when
they
were
built?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
who
own
the
house?
i
am
not
asking
that.
who
own
the
house
when
they
were
built?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
why
they
came
and
built
houses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
did
they
build
them
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
anybody
who
would
buy
the
house?
justice
hugo
l.
black

that
they
do
own
the
house
individually
as
you
say.
justice
hugo
l.
black

crucial
issue
have
been
tried?
justice
hugo
l.
black

about
the
appellate
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
suppose
we
would
decide
that
the
appellate
court
was
wrong,
would
you
still
get
that
issue
tried
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
could
still
try
the
issue
of
dispute
there,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
asking
for
that
privilege?
are
you
asking
for
that
privilege
if
we
reverse
it
on
the
procedure
ground?

it
in
