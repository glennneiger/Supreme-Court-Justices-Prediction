justice
byron

white
that
you
can't
get
an
order
form
from
the
secretary
unless
you
show
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
you're
legal
under
state
law,
can
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
though,
if
the
buyer
demands,
goes
to
a
fellow
that
he
thinks
is
selling
marihuana
and
says
give
me
your
name
and
the
seller
says
sorry,
i
won't
do
it,
and
then
the
buyer,
where
this
putative
buyer
finds
in
that
as
a
sellers
name
not
someone
else
and
puts
it
on
the
order
form,
the
seller
maybe
incriminated,
he
has
incriminated
himself,
has
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
does
he
ever
as
far
his
name
is
concerned?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
through
his
hands
with,
the
seller
has
been
incriminated
himself.
the
buyer's
information,
i
don't
suppose
there
is
anything
that
is
illegally
incriminating
as
far
as
the
seller
is
concerned
and
the
buyer
furnished
some
information
to
the
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
--
that
was
my
next
question;
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
seller
aggregated
name
to
anybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
any
order
form
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
assume
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
that,
this
is
a
provision
of
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
the
amendment
bars
the
government
prohibiting
sales
except
on
other
client,
except
that
has
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
conviction
here
is
for
selling
without
an
order
form?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
proceed
an
order
form?
that's
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
the
--
he
could
not
have
been
convicted
for
this
offense
at
all
if
he
had
received
--
if
he
had
received
the
order
form?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
if
that
so,
there
couldn't
be
any
--
any
self-incrimination
under
this
statute
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
because
he
would
--
he
could
never
be
convicted
under
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
really
quite
so
is
it?
a
lot
of
buyers
know
the
names
of
their
sellers
independently.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
seller
didn't
furnish
the
name,
a
third
party
furnished
the
name.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
so
that
seller
never
incriminated
himself
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
the
seller
never
incriminated
himself
--
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
he
had
received
an
order
form
with
his
name
on
it,
he
automatically
insolates
himself
from
conviction
under
this
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
should
he
be
able
to
say
this
one,
he
never
--
when
there
was
never
an
order
form
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
who's
the
--
the
duty
to
put
the
sellers
name
on
is
placed
on
the
secretary,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
if
a
seller
sells
marihuana
pursuant
to
an
order
form
with
someone
else's
name
on
it,
you
say
he
is
--
he
can
or
cannot
be
prosecuted
under
this
section.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
do
you
day
about,
let's
assume
he
can
be
prosecuted
for
that,
what
do
you
say
to
the
general
proposition
that
requiring
forbidding
him
to
sell
unless
he
acknowledges
who
he
is
violates
the
fifth
amendment.
does
it
violate
the
fifth
amendment
to
be
required
to
say
what
your
name
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
does
that
he
doesn't
acknowledge
who
he
is.
i
mean
if
he
sells
and
if
he
and
as
the
law
says
you
can
only
sell
if
your
name
is
on
the
order
form
and
his
sell,
hasn't
he
admitted
who
is?
i
am
john
smith,
not
brown
and
somebody
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
your
response
then?
is
that
violates
the
fifth
amendment
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
is
if
he
wants
to
sell
marihuana
because
its
a
federal
lawsuit
if
you
sell
without
the
form
with
your
name
on
it,
you
go
to
jail.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
seller
and
the
buyer
didn't
say
anything
to
him,
he
just
comes
in
and
hand
in
a
piece
of
paper
which
says
--
which
is
an
order
to
--
for
a
certain
amount
of
marihuana
and
the
man
takes
it
and
says
okay
and
gives
him
marihuana?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no.
i'm
just
saying
that
that
inherent
in
his
selling,
inherent
and
his
living
up
to
the
statute
as
disclosing
that
his
name
is
john
jones,
or
admitting
that
his
name
is
john
jones.
he
may
not
have
--
the
information
may
not
have
originated
from
him.
he
may
never
have
said
that
his
name
is
john
jones,
but
selling
the
marihuana
in
pursuant
to
this
order
form
under
the
law
is
an
admission
by
him
that
he
is
really
jones,
not
somebody
else,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
is
that
--
is
that
violate
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
should
have
been
on
the
leary
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
law
said
that
no
sellers
shall
sell
on
an
order
form
unless
he
writes
his
name
on
the
order
form?
would
that
make
any
difference?
i've
guess
--
i'd
guess
it
wouldn't
under
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
still
has
the
choice
of
not
of
--
does
not
sell
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
isn't
much
after
leary?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
law
said
you
don't
sell
without
an
order
form
unless
you
write
your
name
on
it
before
you
sell
it
then
give
a
copy
to
the
buyer,
you
would
still
say
no
violation
of
fifth
amendment?
or
would
you
say
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
is
this
harder?
you
think
there's
a
difference
between
that
case
in
just
receiving
the
form
and
symbolically
saying
yes
i'm
so
and
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
the
statute
requires
him
to
disclose
this
information
to
anybody
who
comes
around?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
the
law
says
to
him
if
you
want
to
sell
any
narcotic
which
maybe
legal
under
federal
law
but
illegal
under
state
law,
the
federal
law
tells
you
that
you
must
make
a
record
of
this
sale
illegal
under
state
law,
preserve
it
and
then
a
state
official
would
ask
you
for
the
record,
you
got
to
disclose
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
you
can't
get
an
order
form
from
the
secretary
unless
you
show
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
you're
legal
under
state

can
you?
