mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
petitioner’s
arguments
rest
on
an
assumption
which
is
demonstrably
false,
and
which
it
seems
to
me
has
informed
much
of
the
questioning
during
that
time
of
her
argument.
that
is
to
say,
the
assumption
that
petitioner
had
an
opportunity
to
provide
the
government
with
incriminating
information,
and
then
declined
to
do
so
in
order
to
protect
his
fifth
amendment
right.
such
arguments
could
be
entertained
only
with
the
order
forms
for
which
section
4705
(a)
provides
are
actually
received
by
the
seller
of
narcotic
drugs.
it
is
clear
from
the
government’s
proof
in
this
case,
proof
entirely
independent
of
anything
that
petitioner
said,
or
any
information
that
he
may
have
provided
to
the
government.
it’s
clear
from
that
proof
that
petitioner
received
no
order
form
from
the
purchaser,
a
government
agent.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
clear
from
the
statutory
scheme
as
a
matter
of
law
that
neither
petitioner
nor
anyone
willing
to
purchase
narcotics
from
him
could
lawfully
have
obtained
order
forms
for
that
purpose.
in
these
circumstances,
it
is
entirely
premature
to
ask
what
fifth
amendment
question
might
be
raised
in
a
case
where
an
order
form
is
actually
presented
and
an
obligation
to
disclose
than
arises.
i
think
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
there
is
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
is.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
through
the
criminal
sanction
among
others
of
26
u.s.
code,
section
7203
which
punishes
generally
any
failure
to
conform
to
the
reporting
requirements
of
federal
tax
law.
it
is
not
punishable
under
section
4705
(a).
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
and
never
has
been
punished
under
that
section.
and
of
course,
penalties
as
this
court
recognizes
or
widely
disparate
section
4705
(a)
is
the
most
severe
of
federal
narcotics
violations.
section
7203
states
a
misdemeanor.
we
are
dealing
with
entirely
separate
types
of
things
and
what
i
hope
to
do
is
to
persuade
the
court
that
these
two
different
forms,
if
you
like
putting
of
a
two-step
procedure.
first,
receive
and
order
form.
second,
provide
some
information
on
that
form.
each
step
serves
an
important
function
in
the
course
of
federal
narcotics
regulation.
in
these
circumstances,
as
we
say,
it
is
entirely
premature
to
ask
what
fifth
amendment
question
might
be
raised
if
an
order
form
is
actually
presented.
the
requirement
that
in
the
first
instance
in
order
form
be
received
is
independent
and
neither
that
requirement
nor
petitioner’s
prosecution
for
its
violation
raises
any
question
of
self-incrimination.
that
in
brief
is
the
government’s
case.
the
fifth
amendment
provides
and
i
quote
“that
no
person
shall
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.”
until
petitioner
receives
an
order
form,
he
is
under
no
pressure
whatever
to
give
any
information
of
any
kind
to
the
government.
the
only
pressure
is
the
statutory
command
enforced
by
a
criminal
prosecution,
in
this
case
that
he
not
sells.
thus,
the
government
has
not
as
petitioner
had
suggested
it
had
abandoned
its
contention
that
the
obligation
to
receive
an
order
form
is
distinct
from
the
obligation
to
report
and
retain
certain
types
of
information
and
for
that
matter
to
refrain
from
fraudulent
use
of
order
forms.
obligations
which
are
imposed
by
other
parts
of
section
4705
and
by
federal
income
tax
law
generally.
of
course,
the
obligations
don’t
stop
with
receipt
of
the
form.
once
an
individual
in
a
narcotics
sale
has
received
the
form,
then
the
further
obligation
does
arise
to
report.
that’s
a
different
case.
that’s
the
case
that
isn’t
here.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
form
is
the
form
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
petitioner’s
brief
as
appendix
c
which
provides
for
a
statement
by
the
purchaser
as
to
what
kind
of
drugs
he
wants
and
how
much.
has
a
place
for
the
purchaser’s
name
and
for
his
signature.
it
is
to
be
addressed
to
a
particular
seller.
has
a
place
for
the
seller
to
fill
in,
what
drugs
he
has
sold
and
on
what
date.
and
they
say
simply
to
fill
in
some
questions
that
were
raised
during
petitioner’s
statement,
two
factors
concerning
the
form.
the
form
is
not
issued
in
blank.
by
statute,
section
4705
(f),
before
the
secretary
may
issue
the
form,
he
must
cause
to
be
stamped
on
it
the
name
of
the
purchaser,
and
again
by
statute
section
4705
(g),
it
is
a
felony
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
to
the
purchaser,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
your
honor.
in
someone
wishing
to
purchase
narcotics,
someone
who
must
be
a
lawful
registrant
by
statute,
applies
to
the
secretary
of
treasury
to
get
a
book
of
these
forms.
they
come
in
a
book
of
ten.
when
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
issues
the
forms,
before
issuing
them,
he
stamps
the
name
of
the
purchaser
on
the
form,
so
that
it’s
not
a
book
of
blank
forms,
it’s
a
book
of
forms
which
only,
let’s
say
the
dark
drug
company
can
use.
the
dark
drug
company
may
have
legitimate
need
to
purchase
narcotics
for
medical
use.
it
applies
for
a
book
of
these
forms,
and
will
receive
ten
forms
and
they
will
be
stamped
dark
drug
company.
and
it
is
then
a
felony
for
any
other
person
to
use
those
forms.
they’re
available
only
to
a
specific
purchaser.
when
the
purchaser
wishes
to
make
a
purchase
of
narcotics,
he
fills
out
in
triplicate
this
form
indicating
what
he
wishes
to
purchase
and
he
may
or
may
not
fill
in
the
name
of
the
seller
as
i
understand
it,
and
that
is
entirely
voluntary
with
him.
obviously,
he
will
put
the
name
of
the
seller
some
place
on
an
envelope
for
example,
in
which
he
may
send
the
order,
or
he
may
write
a
covering
letter
but
there
is
no
obligation
that
he
fill
in
the
name
of
the
seller.
it
is
sent
to
the
seller
and
if
the
seller’s
name
is
not
filled
in,
then
the
seller
must
among
other
things,
provide
his
name
as
well
as
the
confirming
information
about
what
drugs
had
been
sold.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
and
the
quantity,
the
confirming
information,
that’s
right.
drugs
have
been
sold
in
the
quantity,
but
the
point
that
i
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right,
400,000.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
approximately
200,000
executed
triplicates
are
received
by
the
secretary
of
treasury
each
month
in
fiscal
year
1967,
only
four
persons
entitled
to
use
order
forms
were
convicted
of
narcotics
offenses.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
very
overwhelming
majority
of
transactions
where
order
forms
are
used
are
legal.
and
that
indeed
is
our
point.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
oh,
i’m
speaking
of
narcotics
generally,
i’m
sorry.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i’m
sorry.
we
weren’t
talking
about
--
i
was
treating
it
as
the
harrison
narcotics
act.
there
is
no
one
who
could
obtain
an
order
form
for
heroin.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
not
quite,
the
secretary
of
treasury
is
in
a
position
to
authorize
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
there
are
no
legal
purchases.
all
experimental
uses
at
this
time
are
carried
on
with
the
stocks
that
the
secretary
has
procedures.
that’s
right.
you’re
correct
so
far
as
heroin
as
concerned,
but
this
is
part
of
a
larger
statutory
scheme.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
and
this
statute
does
not
distinguish
as
to
heroin.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
your
honor
it
does
not.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
because
under
the
statute,
it
is
impossible
to
secure
an
order
form
with
--
for
the
purchase
of
heroin.
it
is
a
felony
to
use
an
order
form
to
purchase
heroin
for
the
purchaser.
order
forms
may
only
be
used
to
purchase
a
lawful
drug
for
a
lawful
purpose.
heroin
is
an
unlawful
drug
for
which
there
is
no
lawful
purchase
--
no
lawful
purpose,
excuse
me.
so
it’s
a
felony
to
obtain
or
use
an
order
form
for
the
purpose
of
purchasing
heroin,
and
now
it
maybe
that
in
some
obscure
situation
this
could
somehow
happen,
40
of
the
roughly
2,400,000
order
forms
that
were
used
in
1967
were
stolen
approximately.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
stolen.
there
were
40
forms
stolen
and
it
is
conceivable
that
somewhere,
someone
having
stolen
an
order
form
which
was
not
issued
to
his
name
and
which
was
therefore
a
felony
for
him
to
use
filled
in
something
with
respect
to
heroin
and
handed
it
to
someone
who
sold
him
some
heroin.
the
government’s
point
in
that
situation
is
that
whatever
violations
of
federal
statutes
may
have
been
involved
there
was
no
violation
of
the
statute
here
in
issue.
the
statute
here
at
issue,
section
4705
(a)
only
punishes
the
situation
where
someone
makes
a
sale
without
receiving
an
order
form,
and
again
if
i
may
say
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
or
any
other
narcotic
drug.
the
statute
does
not
limit
to
heroin.
it’s
limited
to
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
includes
heroin,
that’s
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
he
might
have
been
--
the
purchaser
could
have
been
prosecuted
under
section
4705
(g)
for
fraudulent
use
of
an
order
form.
the
seller
could
certainly
be
prosecuted
under
the
various
statutes
that
make
possession
of
heroin
an
offense,
section
174,
title
21
and
section
4704,
title
26
since
quite
clearly
there
would
be
not
tax
stamps
on
that
package
of
heroin
which
had
been
sold,
but
there
could
be
no
prosecution
under
section
4705
(a).
i
do
think
it’s
important
to
indicate
what
the
separate
function
of
this
requirement
that
you
receive
in
order
form
in
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
since
1956
when
the
penalty
provisions
of
the
harrison
narcotics
act
were
amended
to
differentiate
among
the
various
offenses
and
the
penalty
for
violation
of
section
4705
(a)
was
made
more
severe
than
the
others.
the
practice
has
been
to
use
section
4705
(a)
for
all
illegal
trafficking,
peddling
of
all
narcotic
drugs
including
heroin.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
for
other
offenses.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
it
varies
from
case
to
case.
they
do
add
on
occasion
counts
under
section
4704
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
which
was
i
think
dismissed,
i
don’t
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
don’t
recall
what
it
was.
there
is
no
conviction
on
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
there
is
very
often
and
i
may
say
that
that
is
another
issue.
it
may
be
an
issue
that
the
court
wishes
to
examine.
it’s
not
an
issue,
i
think
presented
by
the
petition
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
not
under
470
--
no,
not
under
4705.
the
purchaser
could
be
prosecuted
under
4705
(g).
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
but
not
the
seller.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
no.
the
seller
could
only
be
prosecuted
for
failure
to
file
the
requisite
forms
under
section
7203
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
and
that
really
brings
up
the
two
different
functions
that
this
statute
serves
and
i
do
have
to
talk
about
the
harrison
act
generally
in
this
situation.
we
have
on
the
one
side
the
channel
of
legitimate
trade
in
narcotic
drugs.
narcotic
drugs
while
they
are
very
dangerous
to
individuals,
addictive,
still
have
important
medical
uses.
and
thousands
of
pounds,
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pounds
of
opium
are
imported
into
this
country
legally
every
year
for
manufacture
into
various
drugs,
not
including
heroin,
and
use
in
medical
trade.
those
legally
imported
drugs
are
supervised
from
the
moment
of
entry
into
the
united
states
to
the
moment
of
their
consumption
by
use
of
the
reports
made
on
triplicates
by
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
legal
users
of
narcotic
drugs
every
month.
that
is
the
function,
if
you
like,
of
the
reporting
aspect
of
the
order
form
requirement.
the
function
of
the
receipt
aspect
of
the
order
form
requirement
which
we’re
talking
about
here
is
quite
different.
by
requiring
that
you
receive
an
order
form,
the
government
is
in
effect
saying
there
shall
be
not
sales
but
legal
sales.
you
can
only
obtain
an
order
form
lawfully
to
use
in
a
narcotics
transaction
and
you
can
only
use
the
order
form
lawfully
if
the
sale
is
a
legal
one
under
federal
law.
that
being
the
case,
the
absence
of
an
order
form,
the
failure
to
receive
an
order
form
if
the
government
can
prove
it
in
any
narcotics
case,
is
immediate
proof
that
the
sale
was
an
illegal
one.
and
it
is
that
separate
function
which
petitioner
seeks
to
affiliate
to
the
question
of
information
gathering,
and
thus
draw
a
conjurer
circle
around
him
self.
and
if
i
may
repeat
that
phrase
that
justice
holmes
use
so
long
ago.
i
think
that
it
could
then
be
quite
clear
that
this
case
is
not
in
the
line
of
cases
which
begun
in
this
court
with
albertson
versus
subversive
activities
control
board,
those
cases
held
in
effect
that
the
fifth
amendment
forbids
statutes
whose
usual
impact
is
to
make
a
separate
crime
out
of
an
individuals
failure
to
report
his
criminal
acts
to
the
government.
here,
the
violation
of
the
statute
consists
not
in
failure
to
report,
but
in
the
positive
act
of
selling
narcotics
to
a
person
who
has
not
proved
his
eligibility
as
a
legal
purchaser
by
presentation
of
an
official
order
form
for
the
narcotics
brought.
the
question
of
reporting,
as
i’ve
just
said,
never
arises
in
that
context,
because
order
forms
cannot
be
obtained.
it’s
only
after
an
order
form
has
been
presented
in
circumstances
not
present
here,
and
in
which
the
overwhelming
majority
of
transactions
are
entirely
legal
that
any
such
question
arises.
and
i
may
say
justice
stewart,
in
response
to
the
remarks
that
you
made
before
about
this
being
heroin
and
to
that
extent
the
heroin
statute,
in
the
processing
of
these
forms,
there
is
no
particular
distinction
made
as
to
what
drug
is
reported
on
them.
there’s
no
different
color
for
an
order
form
that
might
be
used
for
one
drug,
then
for
another
there’s
no
different
filing
system.
the
form
is
part,
and
i
think
the
government
is
entitled
to
insist
that
it
be
treated
as
part
of
the
overall
federal
scheme
of
regulating
traffic
in
narcotic
drugs.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
it
varies
as
i
understand
it
before.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
applicant
fills
in
the
left
hand
1,
2,
3,
4
columns.
the
consignor
fills
in
the
right
two
columns.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
the
secretary
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
correct.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that
is
essentially
true.
there
are
circumstances
in
which
the
secretary
of
treasury
authorizes
the
release
for
experimental
purposes,
but
with
that
exception
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
is
subject
to
regulation
under
the
act,
your
honor,
but
it
is
not
--
while
subject
to
regulation
under
the
act,
through
other
acts,
it
is
may
the
drug
which
cannot
be
legally
obtained.
i
think
one
of
the
principal
acts
for
example,
is
the
narcotics
manufacturing
act
of
1960
which
established
a
federal
system
of
licensing
narcotics
manufacture.
i’m
afraid
it’s
not
set
out
in
the
brief?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
would
be
found
at
21
united
states
code,
section
500
and
following,
and
licensing
provisions
are
section
505
and
506.
in
section
502,
you’ll
find
a
list
of
legally
manufacturable
drugs
which
do
not
include
heroin
and
it’s
sought.
so
that
there
can
be
no
federal
license
for
manufacturing
heroin
in
the
united
states
as
the
law
presently
stands.
under
the
harrison
act,
section
173
of
title
21,
it
is
unlawful
to
import
crude
opium
for
the
purpose
of
manufacturing
heroin.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
sends
it
to
the
seller.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
oh!
excuse
me.
this
is
not
this
form.
to
apply
for
an
order
form
it’s
not
this
form
at
all.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it’s
an
entirely
different
form.
counsel
has
a
copy
of
it
here.
it
is
a
regular
printed
form.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
application
form
for
number
of
order
forms.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no
there
is
not
indication.
all
that’s
necessary
to
indicate
is
his
name
and
his
registration
number.
there
are
limitations
under
the
regulations,
unless
he
is
a
manufacturer
or
a
wholesaler,
he
can
not
obtain
more
than
ten
one
book
at
a
time.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no.
under
section
4705
(g)
your
honor,
law
of
order
forms
can
be
used
only
for
a
lawful
purpose.
it’s
a
felony
to
use
the
order
form
for
an
unlawful
purpose.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
you
can
obtain
an
order.
you
don’t
have
to
tell
the
secretary
of
treasury
what
you
want
the
order
form
for.
if
you
were
the
dark
drug
company,
you
would
have
a
stock
of
order
forms
in
your
office,
or
you
could
obtain
order
forms.
you
wouldn’t
commit
the
felony
until
you
wrote
down
on
the
order
form
that
you
wish
to
buy
five
envelopes
of
heroin
and
attempted
to
use
the
order
form
for
that
purpose,
which
is
an
unlawful
purpose.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
the
order
form
is
--
except
what
is
relevant
is
whether
or
not
the
order
was
received
or
not.
in
nigro,
this
court
talked
about
the
order
form
as
a
kind
of
certificate
of
the
legality
of
the
transaction,
and
it
seems
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
is
--
i
agree
that
it
is
perhaps
more
cumbersome
that
congress
need
have
done,
there’s
simply
a
means
of
identifying
the
illegal
transaction.
since
there
will
be
no
order
forms
used
for
heroin,
any
transaction
in
heroin
necessarily,
will
have
an
order
form
missing.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that
is
correct.
if
there
were
an
order
form
that
was
filled
out
for
heroin
that
would
be
a
violation
of
law.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
section
4705
(g)
which
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
i
think
some
notion
of
the
distance
between
this
statute
and
the
statutes
that
were
involved
albertson,
marchetti,
grosso,
haynes,
and
leary
can
be
obtained
by
a
closer
view
of
the
classes
subject
to
the
provisions
involved
in
those
cases.
in
albertson,
the
statute
involved
made
it
an
offense
for
administratively
identified
members
of
the
communist
party
not
to
register
as
such.
marchetti
and
grosso
involved
the
obligation
of
persons
to
identify
themselves
as
professional
gamblers,
outlawed
in
49
states.
as
this
court
interpreted
the
statute
at
issue
in
haynes,
that
case
required
registration
in
circumstances
which
almost
always
would
establish
prior
criminal
conduct.
in
leary
and
covington
last
term,
the
petitioners
were
obliged
by
payment
of
an
extraordinary
tax,
$100.00
per
ounce
to
identify
themselves
as
members
of
an
entirely
criminal
class.
in
each
of
these
cases
it
was
not
only
the
petitioner
but
all
or
virtually
all
persons
subject
to
the
requirement
in
issue
who
had
engaged
in
criminal
conduct
and
thus
ran
the
risk
of
incriminating
themselves
if
they
did
what
the
government
commanded.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
surely,
sir.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
for
the
purpose
of
prosecuting
this
case,
and
for
the
purpose
of
section
4705
(a)
case
is
generally,
the
only
thing
which
is
relevant
about
the
order
form
is
whether
it
is
received
or
not.
any
information
that
it
may
have
on
it,
any
information
that
may
later
be
put
on
it
is
irrelevant.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
that’s
entirely
consistent
with
what
i’ve
just
said,
your
honor.
these
forms
are
issued
in
blank
for
the
purpose
of
engaging
in
lawful
transactions
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
your
honor,
the
secretary
of
treasury
does
not
know
what
purpose
they
will
be
used
for
when
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
i
think
i’d
been
misunderstood.
the
form
could
not
legally
be
used
for
the
purchase
of
heroin.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
purchaser
would.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i’m
prosecuting
the
seller.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
if
someone
attempted
to
use
an
order
form
to
purchase
heroin,
situation
which
to
my
knowledge
has
never
occurred.
if
someone
attempted
to
do
that,
he
would
be
guilty
of
misuse
of
an
order
form
which
is
a
felony
under
section
4705
(g)
of
the
statute.
and
it’s
an
entirely
separate
thing
to
say
that
if
someone
sells
a
narcotic
drug
including
heroin
without
receiving
any
order
form
at
all,
he
is
guilty
of
a
felony
under
another
section
of
the
statute,
section
4705
(a)
and
that
case
is
what
we
have
in
issue
here
today.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
thought
all
i
would
do
in
the
few
minutes
that
remain
since
there
had
been
some
possibly
some
confusion
on
the
subject,
and
i
think
i
may
have
contributed
to
it,
to
go
through
again
the
procedures
by
which
persons
may
lawfully
obtain
narcotic
drugs.
and
i
think
the
appropriate
place
to
start
is
with
the
obligation
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
statute
does
not
do
so
your
honor.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right.
one
of
the
narcotic
drugs
under
the
statute,
and
i
think
the
government
is
entitled
to
treat
it
as
such.
it
shares
all
relevant
characteristics
with
those
other
drugs.
a
determination
has
been
made
that
it
has
no
lawful
medical
use
on
the
basis
of
that
determination
of
the
federal
statute
--
under
the
federal
statute
for
licensing
the
manufacture
of
narcotic
drugs.
there
is
no
license
for
the
manufacture
of
heroin.
under
the
federal
statute
regulating
the
importation
of
the
raw
materials
of
narcotic
drug,
you
may
not
import
materials
for
the
purpose
of
making
heroin.
but
aside
from
those
particular
restrictions
based
on
that
particular
congressional
finding,
the
drug
is
treated
as
all
other
drugs
under
the
scheme.
section
4721
and
22
imposed
the
obligation
to
register
in
the
particular
circumstances
we’re
talking
about,
probably
the
relevant
obligation
as
to
register
as
a
wholesaler
or
as
a
retailer
of
narcotic
drugs,
and
those
sections
made
quite
clear
that
the
only
person
who
may
register
are
persons
lawfully
entitled
to
sell
narcotic
drugs.
that
is
persons
who
would
violate
no
law
of
the
state
if
they
sold
narcotic
drugs
generally.
once
a
person
has
registered
and
only
in
that
circumstance,
as
provided
by
section
4705
(f),
he
may
apply
to
the
secretary
of
treasury
to
obtain
blank
order
forms,
ten
to
a
book,
with
which
to
purchase
narcotic
drugs
from
the
licensed
manufacturers
of
those
drugs.
the
order
forms
are
issued
to
him
entirely
in
blank
with
one
exception.
his
name
and
address
are
stamped
on
it
by
the
secretary.
there
is
no
requirement
that
he
identify
what
drugs
he
means
to
purchase
or
how
many.
obviously
that
would
be
impractical,
as
i
mentioned
before,
there
are
400,000
registrants
under
this
act.
there
are
well
over
2
million
transactions
annually
using
order
forms.
obviously,
they
asked
someone
to
sit
down
and
pass
on
and
record
each
effort
to
obtain
permission,
to
make
a
purchase
of
such
and
such
a
narcotic
drug
would
be
an
impractical
and
unnecessary
thing
which
congress
has
chosen
not
to
do.
the
lawful
purchaser
then
receives
these
order
forms
in
blank
when
he
has
occasion
to
make
the
purchase
of
any
drug,
he
fills
it
out
in
the
manner
that
you
can
see
in
appendix
c
of
petitioner’s
brief,
and
sends
it
to
the
seller.
he
may
or
may
not
put
the
seller’s
name
in.
that’s
not
important
if
he
doesn’t
do
so
then
the
lawful
seller
will
do
so.
it
is
i
think,
worthy
of
note
that
if
he
uses
that
order
form
for
an
unlawful
purpose
which
would
include
the
purchase
of
a
drug
he’s
not
lawfully
entitled
to
purchase,
heroin,
he
would
be
committing
a
felony
under
section
4705
(g)
which
is
not
a
provision
in
issue
again
in
this
case.
when
the
seller
receives
that
form,
it
is
i
would
say
in
all
cases,
if
you
were
to
put
to
me
a
hypothetical
in
which
the
seller
received
the
form
calling
for
the
purchase
of
heroin
which
is
physically
possible.
a
purchaser
could
write
in
heroin
on
the
form,
i
would
have
to
respond
yes.
that
is
conceivable
although
we
don’t
know
it’s
ever
happened,
so
i
can
say
at
least
in
all
but
the
very
remotest
of
situations,
when
he
receives
that
order
form,
it
is
a
certificate
that
the
transaction
that’s
about
to
take
place
is
a
legal
transaction
and
it
serves
that
important
function
in
its
absence.
one
knows
that
the
transaction
which
has
taken
place
is
an
illegal
transaction
and
that
without
need
for
any
information
on
the
part
of
the
seller
of
any
type.
that
is
the
government’s
case.
we
believe
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
petitioner’s
arguments
rest
on
an
assumption
which
is
demonstrably
false,
and
which
it
seems
to
me
has
informed
much
of
the
questioning
during
that
time
of
her
argument.
that
is
to
say,
the
assumption
that
petitioner
had
an
opportunity
to
provide
the
government
with
incriminating
information,
and
then
declined
to
do
so
in
order
to
protect
his
fifth
amendment
right.
such
arguments
could
be
entertained
only
with
the
order
forms
for
which
section
4705
(a)
provides
are
actually
received
by
the
seller
of
narcotic
drugs.
it
is
clear
from
the
government’s
proof
in
this
case,
proof
entirely
independent
of
anything
that
petitioner
said,
or
any
information
that
he
may
have
provided
to
the
government.
it’s
clear
from
that
proof
that
petitioner
received
no
order
form
from
the
purchaser,
a
government
agent.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
clear
from
the
statutory
scheme
as
a
matter
of
law
that
neither
petitioner
nor
anyone
willing
to
purchase
narcotics
from
him
could
lawfully
have
obtained
order
forms
for
that
purpose.
in
these
circumstances,
it
is
entirely
premature
to
ask
what
fifth
amendment
question
might
be
raised
in
a
case
where
an
order
form
is
actually
presented
and
an
obligation
to
disclose
than
arises.
i
think
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
there
is
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
is.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
through
the
criminal
sanction
among
others
of
26
u.s.
code,
section
7203
which
punishes
generally
any
failure
to
conform
to
the
reporting
requirements
of
federal
tax
law.
it
is
not
punishable
under
section
4705
(a).
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
and
never
has
been
punished
under
that
section.
and
of
course,
penalties
as
this
court
recognizes
or
widely
disparate
section
4705
(a)
is
the
most
severe
of
federal
narcotics
violations.
section
7203
states
a
misdemeanor.
we
are
dealing
with
entirely
separate
types
of
things
and
what
i
hope
to
do
is
to
persuade
the
court
that
these
two
different
forms,
if
you
like
putting
of
a
two-step
procedure.
first,
receive
and
order
form.
second,
provide
some
information
on
that
form.
each
step
serves
an
important
function
in
the
course
of
federal
narcotics
regulation.
in
these
circumstances,
as
we
say,
it
is
entirely
premature
to
ask
what
fifth
amendment
question
might
be
raised
if
an
order
form
is
actually
presented.
the
requirement
that
in
the
first
instance
in
order
form
be
received
is
independent
and
neither
that
requirement
nor
petitioner’s
prosecution
for
its
violation
raises
any
question
of
self-incrimination.
that
in
brief
is
the
government’s
case.
the
fifth
amendment
provides
and
i
quote
“that
no
person
shall
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.”
until
petitioner
receives
an
order
form,
he
is
under
no
pressure
whatever
to
give
any
information
of
any
kind
to
the
government.
the
only
pressure
is
the
statutory
command
enforced
by
a
criminal
prosecution,
in
this
case
that
he
not
sells.
thus,
the
government
has
not
as
petitioner
had
suggested
it
had
abandoned
its
contention
that
the
obligation
to
receive
an
order
form
is
distinct
from
the
obligation
to
report
and
retain
certain
types
of
information
and
for
that
matter
to
refrain
from
fraudulent
use
of
order
forms.
obligations
which
are
imposed
by
other
parts
of
section
4705
and
by
federal
income
tax
law
generally.
of
course,
the
obligations
don’t
stop
with
receipt
of
the
form.
once
an
individual
in
a
narcotics
sale
has
received
the
form,
then
the
further
obligation
does
arise
to
report.
that’s
a
different
case.
that’s
the
case
that
isn’t
here.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
form
is
the
form
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
petitioner’s
brief
as
appendix
c
which
provides
for
a
statement
by
the
purchaser
as
to
what
kind
of
drugs
he
wants
and
how
much.
has
a
place
for
the
purchaser’s
name
and
for
his
signature.
it
is
to
be
addressed
to
a
particular
seller.
has
a
place
for
the
seller
to
fill
in,
what
drugs
he
has
sold
and
on
what
date.
and
they
say
simply
to
fill
in
some
questions
that
were
raised
during
petitioner’s
statement,
two
factors
concerning
the
form.
the
form
is
not
issued
in
blank.
by
statute,
section
4705
(f),
before
the
secretary
may
issue
the
form,
he
must
cause
to
be
stamped
on
it
the
name
of
the
purchaser,
and
again
by
statute
section
4705
(g),
it
is
a
felony
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
to
the
purchaser,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
your
honor.
in
someone
wishing
to
purchase
narcotics,
someone
who
must
be
a
lawful
registrant
by
statute,
applies
to
the
secretary
of
treasury
to
get
a
book
of
these
forms.
they
come
in
a
book
of
ten.
when
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
issues
the
forms,
before
issuing
them,
he
stamps
the
name
of
the
purchaser
on
the
form,
so
that
it’s
not
a
book
of
blank
forms,
it’s
a
book
of
forms
which
only,
let’s
say
the
dark
drug
company
can
use.
the
dark
drug
company
may
have
legitimate
need
to
purchase
narcotics
for
medical
use.
it
applies
for
a
book
of
these
forms,
and
will
receive
ten
forms
and
they
will
be
stamped
dark
drug
company.
and
it
is
then
a
felony
for
any
other
person
to
use
those
forms.
they’re
available
only
to
a
specific
purchaser.
when
the
purchaser
wishes
to
make
a
purchase
of
narcotics,
he
fills
out
in
triplicate
this
form
indicating
what
he
wishes
to
purchase
and
he
may
or
may
not
fill
in
the
name
of
the
seller
as
i
understand
it,
and
that
is
entirely
voluntary
with
him.
obviously,
he
will
put
the
name
of
the
seller
some
place
on
an
envelope
for
example,
in
which
he
may
send
the
order,
or
he
may
write
a
covering
letter
but
there
is
no
obligation
that
he
fill
in
the
name
of
the
seller.
it
is
sent
to
the
seller
and
if
the
seller’s
name
is
not
filled
in,
then
the
seller
must
among
other
things,
provide
his
name
as
well
as
the
confirming
information
about
what
drugs
had
been
sold.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
and
the
quantity,
the
confirming
information,
that’s
right.
drugs
have
been
sold
in
the
quantity,
but
the
point
that
i
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right,
400,000.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
approximately
200,000
executed
triplicates
are
received
by
the
secretary
of
treasury
each
month
in
fiscal
year
1967,
only
four
persons
entitled
to
use
order
forms
were
convicted
of
narcotics
offenses.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
very
overwhelming
majority
of
transactions
where
order
forms
are
used
are
legal.
and
that
indeed
is
our
point.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
oh,
i’m
speaking
of
narcotics
generally,
i’m
sorry.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i’m
sorry.
we
weren’t
talking
about
--
i
was
treating
it
as
the
harrison
narcotics
act.
there
is
no
one
who
could
obtain
an
order
form
for
heroin.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
not
quite,
the
secretary
of
treasury
is
in
a
position
to
authorize
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
there
are
no
legal
purchases.
all
experimental
uses
at
this
time
are
carried
on
with
the
stocks
that
the
secretary
has
procedures.
that’s
right.
you’re
correct
so
far
as
heroin
as
concerned,
but
this
is
part
of
a
larger
statutory
scheme.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
and
this
statute
does
not
distinguish
as
to
heroin.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
your
honor
it
does
not.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
because
under
the
statute,
it
is
impossible
to
secure
an
order
form
with
--
for
the
purchase
of
heroin.
it
is
a
felony
to
use
an
order
form
to
purchase
heroin
for
the
purchaser.
order
forms
may
only
be
used
to
purchase
a
lawful
drug
for
a
lawful
purpose.
heroin
is
an
unlawful
drug
for
which
there
is
no
lawful
purchase
--
no
lawful
purpose,
excuse
me.
so
it’s
a
felony
to
obtain
or
use
an
order
form
for
the
purpose
of
purchasing
heroin,
and
now
it
maybe
that
in
some
obscure
situation
this
could
somehow
happen,
40
of
the
roughly
2,400,000
order
forms
that
were
used
in
1967
were
stolen
approximately.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
stolen.
there
were
40
forms
stolen
and
it
is
conceivable
that
somewhere,
someone
having
stolen
an
order
form
which
was
not
issued
to
his
name
and
which
was
therefore
a
felony
for
him
to
use
filled
in
something
with
respect
to
heroin
and
handed
it
to
someone
who
sold
him
some
heroin.
the
government’s
point
in
that
situation
is
that
whatever
violations
of
federal
statutes
may
have
been
involved
there
was
no
violation
of
the
statute
here
in
issue.
the
statute
here
at
issue,
section
4705
(a)
only
punishes
the
situation
where
someone
makes
a
sale
without
receiving
an
order
form,
and
again
if
i
may
say
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
or
any
other
narcotic
drug.
the
statute
does
not
limit
to
heroin.
it’s
limited
to
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
includes
heroin,
that’s
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
he
might
have
been
--
the
purchaser
could
have
been
prosecuted
under
section
4705
(g)
for
fraudulent
use
of
an
order
form.
the
seller
could
certainly
be
prosecuted
under
the
various
statutes
that
make
possession
of
heroin
an
offense,
section
174,
title
21
and
section
4704,
title
26
since
quite
clearly
there
would
be
not
tax
stamps
on
that
package
of
heroin
which
had
been
sold,
but
there
could
be
no
prosecution
under
section
4705
(a).
i
do
think
it’s
important
to
indicate
what
the
separate
function
of
this
requirement
that
you
receive
in
order
form
in
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
since
1956
when
the
penalty
provisions
of
the
harrison
narcotics
act
were
amended
to
differentiate
among
the
various
offenses
and
the
penalty
for
violation
of
section
4705
(a)
was
made
more
severe
than
the
others.
the
practice
has
been
to
use
section
4705
(a)
for
all
illegal
trafficking,
peddling
of
all
narcotic
drugs
including
heroin.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
for
other
offenses.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
it
varies
from
case
to
case.
they
do
add
on
occasion
counts
under
section
4704
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
which
was
i
think
dismissed,
i
don’t
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
don’t
recall
what
it
was.
there
is
no
conviction
on
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
there
is
very
often
and
i
may
say
that
that
is
another
issue.
it
may
be
an
issue
that
the
court
wishes
to
examine.
it’s
not
an
issue,
i
think
presented
by
the
petition
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
not
under
470
--
no,
not
under
4705.
the
purchaser
could
be
prosecuted
under
4705
(g).
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
but
not
the
seller.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
no.
the
seller
could
only
be
prosecuted
for
failure
to
file
the
requisite
forms
under
section
7203
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
and
that
really
brings
up
the
two
different
functions
that
this
statute
serves
and
i
do
have
to
talk
about
the
harrison
act
generally
in
this
situation.
we
have
on
the
one
side
the
channel
of
legitimate
trade
in
narcotic
drugs.
narcotic
drugs
while
they
are
very
dangerous
to
individuals,
addictive,
still
have
important
medical
uses.
and
thousands
of
pounds,
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pounds
of
opium
are
imported
into
this
country
legally
every
year
for
manufacture
into
various
drugs,
not
including
heroin,
and
use
in
medical
trade.
those
legally
imported
drugs
are
supervised
from
the
moment
of
entry
into
the
united
states
to
the
moment
of
their
consumption
by
use
of
the
reports
made
on
triplicates
by
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
legal
users
of
narcotic
drugs
every
month.
that
is
the
function,
if
you
like,
of
the
reporting
aspect
of
the
order
form
requirement.
the
function
of
the
receipt
aspect
of
the
order
form
requirement
which
we’re
talking
about
here
is
quite
different.
by
requiring
that
you
receive
an
order
form,
the
government
is
in
effect
saying
there
shall
be
not
sales
but
legal
sales.
you
can
only
obtain
an
order
form
lawfully
to
use
in
a
narcotics
transaction
and
you
can
only
use
the
order
form
lawfully
if
the
sale
is
a
legal
one
under
federal
law.
that
being
the
case,
the
absence
of
an
order
form,
the
failure
to
receive
an
order
form
if
the
government
can
prove
it
in
any
narcotics
case,
is
immediate
proof
that
the
sale
was
an
illegal
one.
and
it
is
that
separate
function
which
petitioner
seeks
to
affiliate
to
the
question
of
information
gathering,
and
thus
draw
a
conjurer
circle
around
him
self.
and
if
i
may
repeat
that
phrase
that
justice
holmes
use
so
long
ago.
i
think
that
it
could
then
be
quite
clear
that
this
case
is
not
in
the
line
of
cases
which
begun
in
this
court
with
albertson
versus
subversive
activities
control
board,
those
cases
held
in
effect
that
the
fifth
amendment
forbids
statutes
whose
usual
impact
is
to
make
a
separate
crime
out
of
an
individuals
failure
to
report
his
criminal
acts
to
the
government.
here,
the
violation
of
the
statute
consists
not
in
failure
to
report,
but
in
the
positive
act
of
selling
narcotics
to
a
person
who
has
not
proved
his
eligibility
as
a
legal
purchaser
by
presentation
of
an
official
order
form
for
the
narcotics
brought.
the
question
of
reporting,
as
i’ve
just
said,
never
arises
in
that
context,
because
order
forms
cannot
be
obtained.
it’s
only
after
an
order
form
has
been
presented
in
circumstances
not
present
here,
and
in
which
the
overwhelming
majority
of
transactions
are
entirely
legal
that
any
such
question
arises.
and
i
may
say
justice
stewart,
in
response
to
the
remarks
that
you
made
before
about
this
being
heroin
and
to
that
extent
the
heroin
statute,
in
the
processing
of
these
forms,
there
is
no
particular
distinction
made
as
to
what
drug
is
reported
on
them.
there’s
no
different
color
for
an
order
form
that
might
be
used
for
one
drug,
then
for
another
there’s
no
different
filing
system.
the
form
is
part,
and
i
think
the
government
is
entitled
to
insist
that
it
be
treated
as
part
of
the
overall
federal
scheme
of
regulating
traffic
in
narcotic
drugs.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
it
varies
as
i
understand
it
before.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
applicant
fills
in
the
left
hand
1,
2,
3,
4
columns.
the
consignor
fills
in
the
right
two
columns.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
the
secretary
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
correct.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that
is
essentially
true.
there
are
circumstances
in
which
the
secretary
of
treasury
authorizes
the
release
for
experimental
purposes,
but
with
that
exception
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
is
subject
to
regulation
under
the
act,
your
honor,
but
it
is
not
--
while
subject
to
regulation
under
the
act,
through
other
acts,
it
is
may
the
drug
which
cannot
be
legally
obtained.
i
think
one
of
the
principal
acts
for
example,
is
the
narcotics
manufacturing
act
of
1960
which
established
a
federal
system
of
licensing
narcotics
manufacture.
i’m
afraid
it’s
not
set
out
in
the
brief?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
would
be
found
at
21
united
states
code,
section
500
and
following,
and
licensing
provisions
are
section
505
and
506.
in
section
502,
you’ll
find
a
list
of
legally
manufacturable
drugs
which
do
not
include
heroin
and
it’s
sought.
so
that
there
can
be
no
federal
license
for
manufacturing
heroin
in
the
united
states
as
the
law
presently
stands.
under
the
harrison
act,
section
173
of
title
21,
it
is
unlawful
to
import
crude
opium
for
the
purpose
of
manufacturing
heroin.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
sends
it
to
the
seller.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
oh!
excuse
me.
this
is
not
this
form.
to
apply
for
an
order
form
it’s
not
this
form
at
all.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it’s
an
entirely
different
form.
counsel
has
a
copy
of
it
here.
it
is
a
regular
printed
form.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
application
form
for
number
of
order
forms.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no
there
is
not
indication.
all
that’s
necessary
to
indicate
is
his
name
and
his
registration
number.
there
are
limitations
under
the
regulations,
unless
he
is
a
manufacturer
or
a
wholesaler,
he
can
not
obtain
more
than
ten
one
book
at
a
time.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no.
under
section
4705
(g)
your
honor,
law
of
order
forms
can
be
used
only
for
a
lawful
purpose.
it’s
a
felony
to
use
the
order
form
for
an
unlawful
purpose.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
you
can
obtain
an
order.
you
don’t
have
to
tell
the
secretary
of
treasury
what
you
want
the
order
form
for.
if
you
were
the
dark
drug
company,
you
would
have
a
stock
of
order
forms
in
your
office,
or
you
could
obtain
order
forms.
you
wouldn’t
commit
the
felony
until
you
wrote
down
on
the
order
form
that
you
wish
to
buy
five
envelopes
of
heroin
and
attempted
to
use
the
order
form
for
that
purpose,
which
is
an
unlawful
purpose.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
the
order
form
is
--
except
what
is
relevant
is
whether
or
not
the
order
was
received
or
not.
in
nigro,
this
court
talked
about
the
order
form
as
a
kind
of
certificate
of
the
legality
of
the
transaction,
and
it
seems
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
is
--
i
agree
that
it
is
perhaps
more
cumbersome
that
congress
need
have
done,
there’s
simply
a
means
of
identifying
the
illegal
transaction.
since
there
will
be
no
order
forms
used
for
heroin,
any
transaction
in
heroin
necessarily,
will
have
an
order
form
missing.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that
is
correct.
if
there
were
an
order
form
that
was
filled
out
for
heroin
that
would
be
a
violation
of
law.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
section
4705
(g)
which
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
i
think
some
notion
of
the
distance
between
this
statute
and
the
statutes
that
were
involved
albertson,
marchetti,
grosso,
haynes,
and
leary
can
be
obtained
by
a
closer
view
of
the
classes
subject
to
the
provisions
involved
in
those
cases.
in
albertson,
the
statute
involved
made
it
an
offense
for
administratively
identified
members
of
the
communist
party
not
to
register
as
such.
marchetti
and
grosso
involved
the
obligation
of
persons
to
identify
themselves
as
professional
gamblers,
outlawed
in
49
states.
as
this
court
interpreted
the
statute
at
issue
in
haynes,
that
case
required
registration
in
circumstances
which
almost
always
would
establish
prior
criminal
conduct.
in
leary
and
covington
last
term,
the
petitioners
were
obliged
by
payment
of
an
extraordinary
tax,
$100.00
per
ounce
to
identify
themselves
as
members
of
an
entirely
criminal
class.
in
each
of
these
cases
it
was
not
only
the
petitioner
but
all
or
virtually
all
persons
subject
to
the
requirement
in
issue
who
had
engaged
in
criminal
conduct
and
thus
ran
the
risk
of
incriminating
themselves
if
they
did
what
the
government
commanded.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
surely,
sir.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
for
the
purpose
of
prosecuting
this
case,
and
for
the
purpose
of
section
4705
(a)
case
is
generally,
the
only
thing
which
is
relevant
about
the
order
form
is
whether
it
is
received
or
not.
any
information
that
it
may
have
on
it,
any
information
that
may
later
be
put
on
it
is
irrelevant.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
that’s
entirely
consistent
with
what
i’ve
just
said,
your
honor.
these
forms
are
issued
in
blank
for
the
purpose
of
engaging
in
lawful
transactions
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
your
honor,
the
secretary
of
treasury
does
not
know
what
purpose
they
will
be
used
for
when
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
i
think
i’d
been
misunderstood.
the
form
could
not
legally
be
used
for
the
purchase
of
heroin.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
purchaser
would.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i’m
prosecuting
the
seller.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
if
someone
attempted
to
use
an
order
form
to
purchase
heroin,
situation
which
to
my
knowledge
has
never
occurred.
if
someone
attempted
to
do
that,
he
would
be
guilty
of
misuse
of
an
order
form
which
is
a
felony
under
section
4705
(g)
of
the
statute.
and
it’s
an
entirely
separate
thing
to
say
that
if
someone
sells
a
narcotic
drug
including
heroin
without
receiving
any
order
form
at
all,
he
is
guilty
of
a
felony
under
another
section
of
the
statute,
section
4705
(a)
and
that
case
is
what
we
have
in
issue
here
today.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
thought
all
i
would
do
in
the
few
minutes
that
remain
since
there
had
been
some
possibly
some
confusion
on
the
subject,
and
i
think
i
may
have
contributed
to
it,
to
go
through
again
the
procedures
by
which
persons
may
lawfully
obtain
narcotic
drugs.
and
i
think
the
appropriate
place
to
start
is
with
the
obligation
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
statute
does
not
do
so
your
honor.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right.
one
of
the
narcotic
drugs
under
the
statute,
and
i
think
the
government
is
entitled
to
treat
it
as
such.
it
shares
all
relevant
characteristics
with
those
other
drugs.
a
determination
has
been
made
that
it
has
no
lawful
medical
use
on
the
basis
of
that
determination
of
the
federal
statute
--
under
the
federal
statute
for
licensing
the
manufacture
of
narcotic
drugs.
there
is
no
license
for
the
manufacture
of
heroin.
under
the
federal
statute
regulating
the
importation
of
the
raw
materials
of
narcotic
drug,
you
may
not
import
materials
for
the
purpose
of
making
heroin.
but
aside
from
those
particular
restrictions
based
on
that
particular
congressional
finding,
the
drug
is
treated
as
all
other
drugs
under
the
scheme.
section
4721
and
22
imposed
the
obligation
to
register
in
the
particular
circumstances
we’re
talking
about,
probably
the
relevant
obligation
as
to
register
as
a
wholesaler
or
as
a
retailer
of
narcotic
drugs,
and
those
sections
made
quite
clear
that
the
only
person
who
may
register
are
persons
lawfully
entitled
to
sell
narcotic
drugs.
that
is
persons
who
would
violate
no
law
of
the
state
if
they
sold
narcotic
drugs
generally.
once
a
person
has
registered
and
only
in
that
circumstance,
as
provided
by
section
4705
(f),
he
may
apply
to
the
secretary
of
treasury
to
obtain
blank
order
forms,
ten
to
a
book,
with
which
to
purchase
narcotic
drugs
from
the
licensed
manufacturers
of
those
drugs.
the
order
forms
are
issued
to
him
entirely
in
blank
with
one
exception.
his
name
and
address
are
stamped
on
it
by
the
secretary.
there
is
no
requirement
that
he
identify
what
drugs
he
means
to
purchase
or
how
many.
obviously
that
would
be
impractical,
as
i
mentioned
before,
there
are
400,000
registrants
under
this
act.
there
are
well
over
2
million
transactions
annually
using
order
forms.
obviously,
they
asked
someone
to
sit
down
and
pass
on
and
record
each
effort
to
obtain
permission,
to
make
a
purchase
of
such
and
such
a
narcotic
drug
would
be
an
impractical
and
unnecessary
thing
which
congress
has
chosen
not
to
do.
the
lawful
purchaser
then
receives
these
order
forms
in
blank
when
he
has
occasion
to
make
the
purchase
of
any
drug,
he
fills
it
out
in
the
manner
that
you
can
see
in
appendix
c
of
petitioner’s
brief,
and
sends
it
to
the
seller.
he
may
or
may
not
put
the
seller’s
name
in.
that’s
not
important
if
he
doesn’t
do
so
then
the
lawful
seller
will
do
so.
it
is
i
think,
worthy
of
note
that
if
he
uses
that
order
form
for
an
unlawful
purpose
which
would
include
the
purchase
of
a
drug
he’s
not
lawfully
entitled
to
purchase,
heroin,
he
would
be
committing
a
felony
under
section
4705
(g)
which
is
not
a
provision
in
issue
again
in
this
case.
when
the
seller
receives
that
form,
it
is
i
would
say
in
all
cases,
if
you
were
to
put
to
me
a
hypothetical
in
which
the
seller
received
the
form
calling
for
the
purchase
of
heroin
which
is
physically
possible.
a
purchaser
could
write
in
heroin
on
the
form,
i
would
have
to
respond
yes.
that
is
conceivable
although
we
don’t
know
it’s
ever
happened,
so
i
can
say
at
least
in
all
but
the
very
remotest
of
situations,
when
he
receives
that
order
form,
it
is
a
certificate
that
the
transaction
that’s
about
to
take
place
is
a
legal
transaction
and
it
serves
that
important
function
in
its
absence.
one
knows
that
the
transaction
which
has
taken
place
is
an
illegal
transaction
and
that
without
need
for
any
information
on
the
part
of
the
seller
of
any
type.
that
is
the
government’s
case.
we
believe
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
