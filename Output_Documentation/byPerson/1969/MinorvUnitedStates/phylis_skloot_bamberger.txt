ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
thank
you,
your
honor.
this
case
raises
the
question
as
to
whether
the
petitioner’s
right
against
self-incrimination
is
violated
by
compliance
with
title
26
united
states
code,
section
4705,
and
the
regulations
enacted
by
the
department
of
the
treasury
pursuant
to
it.
that
section
is
the
narcotics
order
form
provision
of
the
harrison
act.
petitioner’s
position,
one
that
is
apparently
not
disputed
by
the
government,
is
that
the
order
form
procedure
or
scheme
necessarily
includes
record
keeping
aspects
and
information
keeping
aspects,
and
that
to
a
person
such
as
petitioner,
this
must
result
in
the
disclosure
of
information
which
is
available
to
law
enforcement
officers
both
state
and
federal
and
which
can
provide
a
link
in
the
chain
of
criminal
prosecution
for
violation
of
federal
and
state
narcotics
laws.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
simple.
there
were
two
sales
of
heroin
by
the
petitioner
to
a
federal
undercover
narcotics
agent.
the
narcotics
agent
did
not
supply
an
order
form
to
the
petitioner
for
the
sales,
and
the
defendant
was
sentenced
to
the
minimum
mandatory
term
of
five
years
on
each
count
to
run
concurrently.
i
think
before
a
discussion
of
the
legal
question
is
involved
--
comes
up
that
we
should
discuss
the
scheme
of
the
statute
as
it
specifically
relates
to
the
order
form
provision.
a
person
who
is
registered
to
deal
in
narcotics
and
has
paid
an
occupation
tax
can
apply
to
the
treasury
department
for
order
forms.
these
order
forms,
a
copy
of
which
is
printed
as
appendix
c
to
the
petitioner’s
brief,
comes
in
a
book
of
ten
which
is
in
a
book
which
looks
like
this.
the
order
form
is
what
is
called
executed
by
the
potential
buyer
of
narcotics.
that
is
he
puts
his
name
and
address
on
the
order
form
and
he
lists
the
narcotics
items
that
he
would
like
to
buy.
he
then
submits
--
the
form
is
issued
in
triplicate.
he
then
submits
the
original
and
the
triplicate
to
the
potential
buyer.
the
buyer
must
supply
the
order
and
on
this
order
form,
he
must
indicate
the
amount
of
drugs
that
he
has
supplied
and
the
date
on
which
he
supplied
them.
prior
to
the
time
that
this
order
form
is
given
to
the
buyer,
or
at
least
at
the
time
of
the
sale,
the
seller’s
name
and
address
must
be
entered
on
the
front
of
the
order
form.
no
provision
makes
clear
who
has
the
responsibility
of
filling
in
the
seller’s
name
and
address,
but
it
is
clear
from
regulation
151.185
that
the
seller
does
have
the
obligation
of
supplying
on
the
order
form
the
amount
of
narcotics
that
he
sells
and
the
date
on
which
the
sale
is
made.
the
original
and
triplicate
of
the
form
are
retained
by
the
seller.
the
duplicate
is
retained
by
the
buyer
of
the
narcotics.
one
of
the
copies
retained
by
the
seller
is
sent
to
the
treasury
department.
he
must
keep
the
other
copy
in
his
possession
for
two
years,
and
during
that
time,
the
order
form
is
available
for
inspection
by
any
federal
or
state
law
enforcement
official.
the
self-incrimination
aspect
of
the
order
form
obviously
is
that
the
seller
himself
must
write
on
the
order
form
the
amount
of
narcotics
that
he
supplies
and
the
date
upon
which
he
supplied
it.
that
would
give
law
enforcement
officials
information
concerning
violation
of
21
u.s.c.
section
173,
174
which
is
the
illegal
importation
of
drugs.
the
section
4704
(a)
which
is
the
transfer
of
drugs
outside
of
the
original
stamped
package,
of
course
there
are
violations
of
state
statutes
as
well,
and
since
this
transaction
took
place
in
new
york,
it
is
important
to
know
that
the
new
york
narcotic
statute
makes
it
a
felony
to
deal
in
heroin
of
more
than
eighth
of
an
ounce.
so
that
the
order
form
provision
would
reveal
to
state
officials
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
committed
a
felony
as
well
as
a
crime.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that’s
correct.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that’s
right.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
the
last
two
columns
in
the
middle
section
of
the
order
form.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
by
the
consignor
which
is
the
vendor
under
the
scheme,
and
he
would
have
to
fill
in
a
number
of
packages
furnished
and
the
date
on
which
the
packages
were
supplied.
and
of
course
by
reference,
it
would
indicate
that
he
did
supply
narcotics
on
the
date
and
in
the
amount
that
he
supplied
them.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
right.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
the
number
of
packages
would
indicate
the
amount
of
the
packages
or
by
weight.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
right.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that
would
be
the
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
--
the
buyer
would
sign
it,
but
the
vendor’s
name
appears
on
it.
if
i
may
direct
your
honor’s
attention
to
the
two
lines
just
above
the
spaces
for
the
drugs
involving
the
transaction.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
it
says
to
and
street.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that’s
addressed
to
the
seller.
now,
it
is
unclear
who
has
to
fill
that
information
in.
there
is
no
regulation
or
statute
which
indicates
who
fills
that
in
or
when
it
has
to
be
filled
in,
but
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
that’s
true
your
honor,
but
even
if
it
were
to
be
filled
in
by
the
buyer
of
the
narcotics,
it
wouldn’t
make
any
difference
because
it
would
be
the
seller
himself
who
would
have
to
reveal
the
fact
that
he
sold
the
narcotics
and
the
date
on
which
he
sold
it
the
number
of
packages
that
he
furnished.
and
regulation
151.185
specifically
states
that
it
is
the
vendor
of
the
narcotics
that
must
fill
in
that
information,
so
that
the
form
even
assuming
that
the
buyer
of
the
narcotics
would
be
the
person
to
fill
in
the
seller’s
name.
the
seller’s
name
would
be
revealed
by
the
order
form
and
the
seller
himself
would
have
to
supply
information
concerning
the
sale.
and
that
is
sufficient
in
my
understanding,
the
prior
cases
of
this
court
to
reveal
incriminatory
information
which
could
be
used
or
could
supply
a
sufficient
link
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
i
don’t
think
so
your
honor,
because
once
--
if
only
the
seller’s
name
were
to
appear
on
the
form
without
any
indication
that
a
sale
had
actually
taken
place,
there
would
be
no
incriminating
information.
the
incriminating
information
is
the
information
that
deals
with
the
sale
itself.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
we
have
to
assume
your
honor
that
the
order
form
has
been
properly
filled
out.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
if
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
filed
by
the
seller
of
the
narcotics.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes,
it
is.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes.
he
has
to
keep
a
copy
and
he
has
a
second
copy
with
the
treasury
department.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
in
this
case
he
is
not
being
prosecuted
for
failing
to
file.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that’s
correct
your
honor,
but
once
as
the
government
concede,
once
the
idea
is
established
and
that’s
the
thrust
of
our
brief,
a
point
which
is
not
disputed
by
the
government
that
receiving
the
order
form
puts
the
obligation
upon
the
buyer
in
the
sale
to
give
the
required
information
--
the
seller,
right,
in
the
sale
to
give
the
required
information
that
the
risk
of
self-incrimination
comes
into
play.
now,
one
of
the
government’s
arguments
in
its
brief
is
that
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
he
could
be
--
now,
i
don’t
know
if
i’m
misunderstanding
your
honor,
he
could
--
there
are
two
instances.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that’s
correct.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that’s
correct.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that’s
correct.
because
once
he
receives
the
order
from,
he
is
under
the
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no,
but
receiving
the
order
form
requires
or
puts
the
obligation
on
him
to
give
the
required
information.
once
he
has
given
that
required
information,
he’s
violated
his
right
against
self
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
the
information
concerning
the
goods
that
are
sold
is
also
in
the
duplicate
held
by
the
buyer
of
the
narcotics.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no,
but
the
buyer
has
to
hold
it
for
two
years
and
it
is
subject
to
the
inspection
of
any
state
or
federal
law
enforcement
agent,
so
that
even
if
a
copy
is
not
filed,
the
information
would
be
available.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
he’s
charged
with
selling
without
an
order
form,
that’s
correct.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no,
his
defense
is
that
because
the
statutory
scheme
--
because
the
receiving
of
the
order
form
and
the
record
keeping
requirements
associated
with
the
order
form
must
be
treated
as
a
unified
scheme
in
order
to
carry
out
the
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting
this
statute
that
by
receiving
the
order
form,
he
is
compelled
to
give
the
information
and
therefore
he
would
be
incriminating
himself.
and
under
the
leary
decision,
the
defendant
does
not
have
to
initiate
the
actions
which
will
ultimately
result
in
self-incrimination.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
let
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
let
me
change
the
language
of
that
statement.
under
the
language
of
leary,
the
defendant
does
not
have
to
begin
the
legal
process
i.e.
obtaining
in
this
case
the
order
form
which
would
ultimately
result
if
he
filed
the
scheme
as
intended
by
congress
in
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes,
because
then
he
would
be
obliged
to
give
the
information
under
the
statutory
scheme.
now,
if
i
could,
maybe
an
explanation
as
to
the
scheme
and
the
purpose
of
the
scheme
might
be
helpful
here
and
that’s
in
our
point
c
of
our
brief.
the
harrison
act
was
originally
enacted
as
a
taxing
scheme
in
order
to
control
the
flow
of
narcotics
and
to
assist
the
states
in
enforcing
their
narcotic
statutes.
the
scheme
was
enacted
in
1914.
the
order
form
provision
was
enacted
as
part
of
the
scheme
in
order
to
assist
the
government
in
collecting
the
taxes
which
it
had
imposed
on
narcotics
transactions,
and
to
avoid
or
to
assist
in
determining
of
who
was
involving
in
narcotics
transaction
attempting
to
avoid
payment
of
these
taxes.
so
that
the
order
form
provision
is
an
integral
part
of
the
total
scheme
of
the
taxation
and
treated
merely
as
a
means
for
physically
transferring
the
narcotics
from
the
seller
to
the
buyer.
it
does
not
satisfy
the
statutory
scheme.
the
record
keeping
aspects
of
the
order
form
provision
are
crucial
in
carrying
out
the
scheme
in
order
to
help
the
government
collect
its
taxes,
and
in
order
to
determine
who
is
evading
the
tax
provisions.
now,
on
that
theory
which
is
we
feel
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
assuming
he
asked
the
government
agent
for
the
order
form,
he
would
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
just
saying
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
without
making
any
sale?
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
if
he
applies
for
the
order
form
and
doesn’t
get
it
and
makes
the
sale,
then
he
is
prosecuted
under
section
4705.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
the
same
right
that
if
he
got
the
order
form,
he
would
be
compelled
to
give
the
information
which
would
incriminate
him
on
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
he
would
most
likely
be
charged
with
making
the
sale
without
the
form.
it
seems
to
me
that
failure
to
fill
out
the
form,
the
statute
would
come
into
play
only
if
he
acts
for
and
received
the
order
form
and
failed
in
some
way
to
supply
the
information.
but
it
doesn’t
make--
our
theory
of
the
case
--
under
our
theory
of
the
case,
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
because
under
either
section,
he
would
be
prosecuted
for
not
giving
the
information
and
therefore
being
forced,
if
he
did
give
the
information,
to
incriminate
himself.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
this
court
has,
i
think,
already
answered
that
question
in
the
marchetti
series
of
cases,
in
which
they
said
that
--
well,
in
the
marchetti
case
in
which
the
government’s
argument
was
that
a
person
who
gets
his
registers
under
the
gambling
tax
statute
can
always
choose
not
to
become
a
gambler,
and
therefore
he
wouldn’t
be
incriminated
himself.
this
court
rejected
that
theory
that
didn’t
have
to
be
his
choice.
his
choice
was
not
to
incriminate
himself
or
not
to
violate
the
law.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
as
a
matter
of
the
scheme,
he
would
not
be
applying
for
the
order
form.
his
buyer
would
be
--
or
the
person
would
buy
from
him
would
be
applying
for
the
order
form.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
i
have
--
one
difficulty
with
the
question
and
that
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that
in
and
of
itself
is
self-incriminatory
because
he
is
then
obliged
to
reveal
the
information
concerning
a
sale.
now,
if
he
commits
no
sale,
i
think
that
was
the
thrust
of
your
honor’s
question,
he
would
not
under
those
circumstances,
be
obliged
to
give
any
information
because
he
made
no
sale.
and
i
think
that
in
that
case
he
would
not
incriminate
himself.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
in
this
case,
he
made
a
sale.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
and
he
--
the
blank
was
not
offered
to
him
nor
did
he
request
it.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
but
it’s
our
position
that
he
did
not
have
to
request
it
in
the
first
instance,
because
had
he
done
so
and
had
he
received
it,
he
would
have
been
obliged
to
fill
it
out,
and
he
would
have
incriminated
himself.
since
that
obligation
would
have
been
thrust
on
him
had
he
received
it,
our
argument
is
that
he
does
not
have
to
take
that
risk
as
this
court
has
stated
in
leary
by
even
asking
for
in
the
first
place.
in
the
leary
case,
this
court
held
that
leary
did
not
even
have
to
go
to
try
to
register
because
the
government’s
position
in
leary
was
that
if
leary
had
gone
to
try
to
register
so
that
he
could
buy
marihuana,
nobody
would’ve
known
that
he
would’ve
--
that
he
was
revealing
information
because
he
wouldn’t
have
been
permitted
to
register
and
nobody
would’ve
seen
the
form.
but
this
court
stated
in
leary,
that
leary
didn’t
even
have
to
go
through
the
steps
of
beginning
his
registration
because
that
might
have
subjected
him
under
the
statutory
scheme
as
it
was
intended
by
congress
to
function
to
the
risk
of
having
to
supply
that
information.
and
i
think
that
the
leary
case
directly
covers
the
question
that
your
honor
has
asked
here.
he
does
not
have
to
begin
the
process
because
to
begin
it
would
thrust
the
obligation
on
him
to
supply
that
information.
the
--
i
might
also
add
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
treat
the
order
form
provision
as
an
inherent
part
of
the
taxing
scheme
in
addition
to
the
legislative
history
treating
it
that
way.
one
of
the
--
another
problem
in
this
case
is
whether
the
statute
was
directed
to
those
inherently
suspect
of
criminal
activities.
this
was
a
question
which
was
raised
by
the
circuit
in
its
opinion.
once
again,
i
believe
that
the
leary
decision,
the
reasoning
in
the
leary
decision,
covers
that
problem
in
this
case
too.
the
court
held
in
leary
that
those
who
could
register
to
deal
in
marihuana
would
do
so,
because
if
they
didn’t
register
they
would
be
acting
illegally
and
the
penalties
were
quite
severe.
therefore,
this
court
was
willing
to
assume
that
everybody
who
could
register
would
register,
and
that
the
only
people
who
would
be
faced
with
the
self-incrimination
problem
would
be
the
people
who
could
not
register,
and
therefore
you
would
have
a
distinct
class
of
people
involved
in
criminal
activities
that
the
self-incrimination
problem
would
be
directed
to.
this
point
is
apparently
not
disputed
by
the
government
because
on
page
11
in
its
brief,
the
government
states
that
anybody
who
could
register
under
state
law
would
also
--
well,
nobody
could
register
under
federal
law,
unless
they
were
permitted
to
register
under
state
law.
thus,
we
have
the
assumption
that
everybody
who
could
register
would
register
and
falls
within
the
leary
reasoning.
of
course,
this
case
deals
with
heroin.
since
under
the
statutes
of
relating
to
narcotics
as
they
are
presently
constituted,
there
is
no
legal
dealing
in
heroin.
therefore,
the
application
of
this
statute
to
any
heroin
transaction
automatically
results
in
the
application
of
it
to
a
class
of
individuals
that
is
suspect
of
criminal
activities.
the
government
in
its
brief
indicates
that
to
avoid
violation,
and
i
think
this
goes
back
to
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question,
to
avoid
violation
you
don’t
--
the
defendant
need
not
act.
i
think
that
reasoning
was
put
to
rest
by
this
court
in
marchetti
where
the
government
argued
that
he
need
not
gamble
once
he’s
--
the
defendant
need
not
gamble
once
he
has
registered.
the
court
said
that
that
is
not
true
where
if
he
complies
with
the
statute,
he
would
reveal
information
which
would
subject
him
to
criminal
penalties
under
on
other
sections.
and
i
think
that
the
same
reasoning
applies
to
this
case.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
i
don’t
think
so
your
honor,
because
then
conceivably
if
the
government
could
find
out
that
he
made
such
a
sale
which
they
often
do
with
the
use
of
undercover
narcotics
agents,
they
could
prosecute
him
under
section
21
u.s.c.
section
173-174.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that’s
the
illegal
importation
of
--
well,
consuming,
facilitation
and
possession
of
narcotics
that
have
been
imported
with
knowledge
that
they’ve
been
imported,
and
possession
gives
rise
to
the
presumption
of
knowledge
and
importation.
of
course
the
defendant
could
also
have
been
prosecuted
under
the
state
statutes.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no,
but
it’s
an
answer
to
the
question.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
will
address
briefly
to
three
questions
which
were
raised
in
the
argument.
first,
mr.
justice
stewart
spoke
of
a
missing
link.
i
would
suggest
that
in
this
case
while
the
statute
is
not
identical
to
those
of
the
prior
cases
in
this
area.
the
difference
is
not
material
and
should
not
be
dispositive,
because
leary
assumes
that
the
statute
will
function
as
it
was
intended
to
do
by
congress.
to
do
that
or
to
interpret
that
statute
in
any
other
way
or
to
apply
it
in
any
other
way,
undermines
the
rules
of
--
that
were
established
with
respect
to
the
fifth
amendment
in
the
series
of
cases
prior
to
this.
so
we
come
to
determine
what
--
how
that
missing
link
affects
these
rights.
it
is
our
position
that
the
fifth
amendment
right
is
the
same
here
as
it
has
been
in
prior
cases.
although
the
very
words
of
the
section
which
provide
the
criminal
penalty
do
not
include
the
provisions
requiring
the
information,
the
rest
of
the
statute
requires
the
incriminatory
information
and
on
the
congressional
scheme,
it
must
be
interpreted
as
a
whole.
thus,
if
the
defendant
receives
the
order
form
as
has
been
stated
by
the
government,
he
must
give
the
information.
his
position
then
is
no
different
if
he
doesn’t
ask
for
it
with
the
knowledge
that
if
he
receives
it,
he
will
have
to
supply
the
incriminating
information.
he
merely
can
stop,
as
this
court
has
said
previously
at
the
initial
stages
of
the
proceeding,
rather
than
waiting
until
other
statutes
come
in
to
play
in
a
different
factual
context.
the
government
has
indicated
in
its
argument
that
the
application
of
the
order
form
procedure
to
the
heroin
transaction.
the
order
form
procedure
has
its
purpose
the
disclosure
of
information
as
applied
to
the
heroin
transaction.
this
must
always
result
in
the
disclosure
of
incriminating
information
as
to
the
seller.
we
are
not
concerned
here
with
the
purchaser.
the
effect
of
section
4705
is
to
give
the
transaction
an
appearance
of
legality.
since
it
says
that
a
sale
can
be
made
with
an
order
form,
while
the
provision
--
while
the
sale
may
be
illegal
under
other
sections
that
is
precisely
the
problem
raised
by
falling
into
4705
(a).
the
transaction
appears
to
be
legal
and
complying
with
it
appears
to
make
it
justifiable
and
legal
at
the
same
time
complying
with
it
reveals
the
violations
of
the
other
statutes
which
would
be
violated
by
heroin
transaction.
again
i
can
only
indicate
that
the
missing
link
is
not
substantial
because
compliance
in
the
receipt
of
the
order
form
cannot
be
separated
because
of
the
congressional
intent
with
the
statute
from
the
information
giving
aspects
of
the
statute.
even
though
another
statute
may
come
into
play
in
a
different
factual
context,
and
that
other
statute
may
also
violate
the
fifth
amendment,
this
statute
does
too
if
we
look
at
the
full
implications
of
compliance
with
it.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no,
i
don’t
your
honor,
because
that
statute
does
not
make
his
--
does
not
give
his
act
in
appearance
of
legality
by
indicating
that
he
has
violated
some
other
statute.
if
he
were
to
file
such
an
affidavit,
he
would
be
practicing
law
illegally
because
it
had
not
been
properly
admitted.
but
it
wouldn’t,
the
statute
itself
would
not
compel
him
to
reveal
information
which
would
violate
another
statute,
which
would
indicate
a
violation
of
another
statute.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes,
but
that’s
not
this
case
where
it
permits
him
make
the
sale,
if
he
reveals
information
which
would
indicate
a
violation
of
other
statutes.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
thank
you,
your
honor.
this
case
raises
the
question
as
to
whether
the
petitioner’s
right
against
self-incrimination
is
violated
by
compliance
with
title
26
united
states
code,
section
4705,
and
the
regulations
enacted
by
the
department
of
the
treasury
pursuant
to
it.
that
section
is
the
narcotics
order
form
provision
of
the
harrison
act.
petitioner’s
position,
one
that
is
apparently
not
disputed
by
the
government,
is
that
the
order
form
procedure
or
scheme
necessarily
includes
record
keeping
aspects
and
information
keeping
aspects,
and
that
to
a
person
such
as
petitioner,
this
must
result
in
the
disclosure
of
information
which
is
available
to
law
enforcement
officers
both
state
and
federal
and
which
can
provide
a
link
in
the
chain
of
criminal
prosecution
for
violation
of
federal
and
state
narcotics
laws.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
simple.
there
were
two
sales
of
heroin
by
the
petitioner
to
a
federal
undercover
narcotics
agent.
the
narcotics
agent
did
not
supply
an
order
form
to
the
petitioner
for
the
sales,
and
the
defendant
was
sentenced
to
the
minimum
mandatory
term
of
five
years
on
each
count
to
run
concurrently.
i
think
before
a
discussion
of
the
legal
question
is
involved
--
comes
up
that
we
should
discuss
the
scheme
of
the
statute
as
it
specifically
relates
to
the
order
form
provision.
a
person
who
is
registered
to
deal
in
narcotics
and
has
paid
an
occupation
tax
can
apply
to
the
treasury
department
for
order
forms.
these
order
forms,
a
copy
of
which
is
printed
as
appendix
c
to
the
petitioner’s
brief,
comes
in
a
book
of
ten
which
is
in
a
book
which
looks
like
this.
the
order
form
is
what
is
called
executed
by
the
potential
buyer
of
narcotics.
that
is
he
puts
his
name
and
address
on
the
order
form
and
he
lists
the
narcotics
items
that
he
would
like
to
buy.
he
then
submits
--
the
form
is
issued
in
triplicate.
he
then
submits
the
original
and
the
triplicate
to
the
potential
buyer.
the
buyer
must
supply
the
order
and
on
this
order
form,
he
must
indicate
the
amount
of
drugs
that
he
has
supplied
and
the
date
on
which
he
supplied
them.
prior
to
the
time
that
this
order
form
is
given
to
the
buyer,
or
at
least
at
the
time
of
the
sale,
the
seller’s
name
and
address
must
be
entered
on
the
front
of
the
order
form.
no
provision
makes
clear
who
has
the
responsibility
of
filling
in
the
seller’s
name
and
address,
but
it
is
clear
from
regulation
151.185
that
the
seller
does
have
the
obligation
of
supplying
on
the
order
form
the
amount
of
narcotics
that
he
sells
and
the
date
on
which
the
sale
is
made.
the
original
and
triplicate
of
the
form
are
retained
by
the
seller.
the
duplicate
is
retained
by
the
buyer
of
the
narcotics.
one
of
the
copies
retained
by
the
seller
is
sent
to
the
treasury
department.
he
must
keep
the
other
copy
in
his
possession
for
two
years,
and
during
that
time,
the
order
form
is
available
for
inspection
by
any
federal
or
state
law
enforcement
official.
the
self-incrimination
aspect
of
the
order
form
obviously
is
that
the
seller
himself
must
write
on
the
order
form
the
amount
of
narcotics
that
he
supplies
and
the
date
upon
which
he
supplied
it.
that
would
give
law
enforcement
officials
information
concerning
violation
of
21
u.s.c.
section
173,
174
which
is
the
illegal
importation
of
drugs.
the
section
4704
(a)
which
is
the
transfer
of
drugs
outside
of
the
original
stamped
package,
of
course
there
are
violations
of
state
statutes
as
well,
and
since
this
transaction
took
place
in
new
york,
it
is
important
to
know
that
the
new
york
narcotic
statute
makes
it
a
felony
to
deal
in
heroin
of
more
than
eighth
of
an
ounce.
so
that
the
order
form
provision
would
reveal
to
state
officials
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
committed
a
felony
as
well
as
a
crime.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that’s
correct.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that’s
right.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
the
last
two
columns
in
the
middle
section
of
the
order
form.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
by
the
consignor
which
is
the
vendor
under
the
scheme,
and
he
would
have
to
fill
in
a
number
of
packages
furnished
and
the
date
on
which
the
packages
were
supplied.
and
of
course
by
reference,
it
would
indicate
that
he
did
supply
narcotics
on
the
date
and
in
the
amount
that
he
supplied
them.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
right.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
the
number
of
packages
would
indicate
the
amount
of
the
packages
or
by
weight.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
right.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that
would
be
the
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
--
the
buyer
would
sign
it,
but
the
vendor’s
name
appears
on
it.
if
i
may
direct
your
honor’s
attention
to
the
two
lines
just
above
the
spaces
for
the
drugs
involving
the
transaction.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
it
says
to
and
street.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that’s
addressed
to
the
seller.
now,
it
is
unclear
who
has
to
fill
that
information
in.
there
is
no
regulation
or
statute
which
indicates
who
fills
that
in
or
when
it
has
to
be
filled
in,
but
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
that’s
true
your
honor,
but
even
if
it
were
to
be
filled
in
by
the
buyer
of
the
narcotics,
it
wouldn’t
make
any
difference
because
it
would
be
the
seller
himself
who
would
have
to
reveal
the
fact
that
he
sold
the
narcotics
and
the
date
on
which
he
sold
it
the
number
of
packages
that
he
furnished.
and
regulation
151.185
specifically
states
that
it
is
the
vendor
of
the
narcotics
that
must
fill
in
that
information,
so
that
the
form
even
assuming
that
the
buyer
of
the
narcotics
would
be
the
person
to
fill
in
the
seller’s
name.
the
seller’s
name
would
be
revealed
by
the
order
form
and
the
seller
himself
would
have
to
supply
information
concerning
the
sale.
and
that
is
sufficient
in
my
understanding,
the
prior
cases
of
this
court
to
reveal
incriminatory
information
which
could
be
used
or
could
supply
a
sufficient
link
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
i
don’t
think
so
your
honor,
because
once
--
if
only
the
seller’s
name
were
to
appear
on
the
form
without
any
indication
that
a
sale
had
actually
taken
place,
there
would
be
no
incriminating
information.
the
incriminating
information
is
the
information
that
deals
with
the
sale
itself.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
we
have
to
assume
your
honor
that
the
order
form
has
been
properly
filled
out.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
if
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
filed
by
the
seller
of
the
narcotics.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes,
it
is.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes.
he
has
to
keep
a
copy
and
he
has
a
second
copy
with
the
treasury
department.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
in
this
case
he
is
not
being
prosecuted
for
failing
to
file.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that’s
correct
your
honor,
but
once
as
the
government
concede,
once
the
idea
is
established
and
that’s
the
thrust
of
our
brief,
a
point
which
is
not
disputed
by
the
government
that
receiving
the
order
form
puts
the
obligation
upon
the
buyer
in
the
sale
to
give
the
required
information
--
the
seller,
right,
in
the
sale
to
give
the
required
information
that
the
risk
of
self-incrimination
comes
into
play.
now,
one
of
the
government’s
arguments
in
its
brief
is
that
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
he
could
be
--
now,
i
don’t
know
if
i’m
misunderstanding
your
honor,
he
could
--
there
are
two
instances.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that’s
correct.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that’s
correct.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that’s
correct.
because
once
he
receives
the
order
from,
he
is
under
the
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no,
but
receiving
the
order
form
requires
or
puts
the
obligation
on
him
to
give
the
required
information.
once
he
has
given
that
required
information,
he’s
violated
his
right
against
self
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
the
information
concerning
the
goods
that
are
sold
is
also
in
the
duplicate
held
by
the
buyer
of
the
narcotics.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no,
but
the
buyer
has
to
hold
it
for
two
years
and
it
is
subject
to
the
inspection
of
any
state
or
federal
law
enforcement
agent,
so
that
even
if
a
copy
is
not
filed,
the
information
would
be
available.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
he’s
charged
with
selling
without
an
order
form,
that’s
correct.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no,
his
defense
is
that
because
the
statutory
scheme
--
because
the
receiving
of
the
order
form
and
the
record
keeping
requirements
associated
with
the
order
form
must
be
treated
as
a
unified
scheme
in
order
to
carry
out
the
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting
this
statute
that
by
receiving
the
order
form,
he
is
compelled
to
give
the
information
and
therefore
he
would
be
incriminating
himself.
and
under
the
leary
decision,
the
defendant
does
not
have
to
initiate
the
actions
which
will
ultimately
result
in
self-incrimination.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
let
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
let
me
change
the
language
of
that
statement.
under
the
language
of
leary,
the
defendant
does
not
have
to
begin
the
legal
process
i.e.
obtaining
in
this
case
the
order
form
which
would
ultimately
result
if
he
filed
the
scheme
as
intended
by
congress
in
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes,
because
then
he
would
be
obliged
to
give
the
information
under
the
statutory
scheme.
now,
if
i
could,
maybe
an
explanation
as
to
the
scheme
and
the
purpose
of
the
scheme
might
be
helpful
here
and
that’s
in
our
point
c
of
our
brief.
the
harrison
act
was
originally
enacted
as
a
taxing
scheme
in
order
to
control
the
flow
of
narcotics
and
to
assist
the
states
in
enforcing
their
narcotic
statutes.
the
scheme
was
enacted
in
1914.
the
order
form
provision
was
enacted
as
part
of
the
scheme
in
order
to
assist
the
government
in
collecting
the
taxes
which
it
had
imposed
on
narcotics
transactions,
and
to
avoid
or
to
assist
in
determining
of
who
was
involving
in
narcotics
transaction
attempting
to
avoid
payment
of
these
taxes.
so
that
the
order
form
provision
is
an
integral
part
of
the
total
scheme
of
the
taxation
and
treated
merely
as
a
means
for
physically
transferring
the
narcotics
from
the
seller
to
the
buyer.
it
does
not
satisfy
the
statutory
scheme.
the
record
keeping
aspects
of
the
order
form
provision
are
crucial
in
carrying
out
the
scheme
in
order
to
help
the
government
collect
its
taxes,
and
in
order
to
determine
who
is
evading
the
tax
provisions.
now,
on
that
theory
which
is
we
feel
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
assuming
he
asked
the
government
agent
for
the
order
form,
he
would
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
just
saying
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
without
making
any
sale?
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
if
he
applies
for
the
order
form
and
doesn’t
get
it
and
makes
the
sale,
then
he
is
prosecuted
under
section
4705.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
the
same
right
that
if
he
got
the
order
form,
he
would
be
compelled
to
give
the
information
which
would
incriminate
him
on
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
he
would
most
likely
be
charged
with
making
the
sale
without
the
form.
it
seems
to
me
that
failure
to
fill
out
the
form,
the
statute
would
come
into
play
only
if
he
acts
for
and
received
the
order
form
and
failed
in
some
way
to
supply
the
information.
but
it
doesn’t
make--
our
theory
of
the
case
--
under
our
theory
of
the
case,
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
because
under
either
section,
he
would
be
prosecuted
for
not
giving
the
information
and
therefore
being
forced,
if
he
did
give
the
information,
to
incriminate
himself.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
this
court
has,
i
think,
already
answered
that
question
in
the
marchetti
series
of
cases,
in
which
they
said
that
--
well,
in
the
marchetti
case
in
which
the
government’s
argument
was
that
a
person
who
gets
his
registers
under
the
gambling
tax
statute
can
always
choose
not
to
become
a
gambler,
and
therefore
he
wouldn’t
be
incriminated
himself.
this
court
rejected
that
theory
that
didn’t
have
to
be
his
choice.
his
choice
was
not
to
incriminate
himself
or
not
to
violate
the
law.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
as
a
matter
of
the
scheme,
he
would
not
be
applying
for
the
order
form.
his
buyer
would
be
--
or
the
person
would
buy
from
him
would
be
applying
for
the
order
form.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
i
have
--
one
difficulty
with
the
question
and
that
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that
in
and
of
itself
is
self-incriminatory
because
he
is
then
obliged
to
reveal
the
information
concerning
a
sale.
now,
if
he
commits
no
sale,
i
think
that
was
the
thrust
of
your
honor’s
question,
he
would
not
under
those
circumstances,
be
obliged
to
give
any
information
because
he
made
no
sale.
and
i
think
that
in
that
case
he
would
not
incriminate
himself.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
in
this
case,
he
made
a
sale.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
and
he
--
the
blank
was
not
offered
to
him
nor
did
he
request
it.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
but
it’s
our
position
that
he
did
not
have
to
request
it
in
the
first
instance,
because
had
he
done
so
and
had
he
received
it,
he
would
have
been
obliged
to
fill
it
out,
and
he
would
have
incriminated
himself.
since
that
obligation
would
have
been
thrust
on
him
had
he
received
it,
our
argument
is
that
he
does
not
have
to
take
that
risk
as
this
court
has
stated
in
leary
by
even
asking
for
in
the
first
place.
in
the
leary
case,
this
court
held
that
leary
did
not
even
have
to
go
to
try
to
register
because
the
government’s
position
in
leary
was
that
if
leary
had
gone
to
try
to
register
so
that
he
could
buy
marihuana,
nobody
would’ve
known
that
he
would’ve
--
that
he
was
revealing
information
because
he
wouldn’t
have
been
permitted
to
register
and
nobody
would’ve
seen
the
form.
but
this
court
stated
in
leary,
that
leary
didn’t
even
have
to
go
through
the
steps
of
beginning
his
registration
because
that
might
have
subjected
him
under
the
statutory
scheme
as
it
was
intended
by
congress
to
function
to
the
risk
of
having
to
supply
that
information.
and
i
think
that
the
leary
case
directly
covers
the
question
that
your
honor
has
asked
here.
he
does
not
have
to
begin
the
process
because
to
begin
it
would
thrust
the
obligation
on
him
to
supply
that
information.
the
--
i
might
also
add
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
treat
the
order
form
provision
as
an
inherent
part
of
the
taxing
scheme
in
addition
to
the
legislative
history
treating
it
that
way.
one
of
the
--
another
problem
in
this
case
is
whether
the
statute
was
directed
to
those
inherently
suspect
of
criminal
activities.
this
was
a
question
which
was
raised
by
the
circuit
in
its
opinion.
once
again,
i
believe
that
the
leary
decision,
the
reasoning
in
the
leary
decision,
covers
that
problem
in
this
case
too.
the
court
held
in
leary
that
those
who
could
register
to
deal
in
marihuana
would
do
so,
because
if
they
didn’t
register
they
would
be
acting
illegally
and
the
penalties
were
quite
severe.
therefore,
this
court
was
willing
to
assume
that
everybody
who
could
register
would
register,
and
that
the
only
people
who
would
be
faced
with
the
self-incrimination
problem
would
be
the
people
who
could
not
register,
and
therefore
you
would
have
a
distinct
class
of
people
involved
in
criminal
activities
that
the
self-incrimination
problem
would
be
directed
to.
this
point
is
apparently
not
disputed
by
the
government
because
on
page
11
in
its
brief,
the
government
states
that
anybody
who
could
register
under
state
law
would
also
--
well,
nobody
could
register
under
federal
law,
unless
they
were
permitted
to
register
under
state
law.
thus,
we
have
the
assumption
that
everybody
who
could
register
would
register
and
falls
within
the
leary
reasoning.
of
course,
this
case
deals
with
heroin.
since
under
the
statutes
of
relating
to
narcotics
as
they
are
presently
constituted,
there
is
no
legal
dealing
in
heroin.
therefore,
the
application
of
this
statute
to
any
heroin
transaction
automatically
results
in
the
application
of
it
to
a
class
of
individuals
that
is
suspect
of
criminal
activities.
the
government
in
its
brief
indicates
that
to
avoid
violation,
and
i
think
this
goes
back
to
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question,
to
avoid
violation
you
don’t
--
the
defendant
need
not
act.
i
think
that
reasoning
was
put
to
rest
by
this
court
in
marchetti
where
the
government
argued
that
he
need
not
gamble
once
he’s
--
the
defendant
need
not
gamble
once
he
has
registered.
the
court
said
that
that
is
not
true
where
if
he
complies
with
the
statute,
he
would
reveal
information
which
would
subject
him
to
criminal
penalties
under
on
other
sections.
and
i
think
that
the
same
reasoning
applies
to
this
case.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
i
don’t
think
so
your
honor,
because
then
conceivably
if
the
government
could
find
out
that
he
made
such
a
sale
which
they
often
do
with
the
use
of
undercover
narcotics
agents,
they
could
prosecute
him
under
section
21
u.s.c.
section
173-174.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that’s
the
illegal
importation
of
--
well,
consuming,
facilitation
and
possession
of
narcotics
that
have
been
imported
with
knowledge
that
they’ve
been
imported,
and
possession
gives
rise
to
the
presumption
of
knowledge
and
importation.
of
course
the
defendant
could
also
have
been
prosecuted
under
the
state
statutes.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no,
but
it’s
an
answer
to
the
question.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
will
address
briefly
to
three
questions
which
were
raised
in
the
argument.
first,
mr.
justice
stewart
spoke
of
a
missing
link.
i
would
suggest
that
in
this
case
while
the
statute
is
not
identical
to
those
of
the
prior
cases
in
this
area.
the
difference
is
not
material
and
should
not
be
dispositive,
because
leary
assumes
that
the
statute
will
function
as
it
was
intended
to
do
by
congress.
to
do
that
or
to
interpret
that
statute
in
any
other
way
or
to
apply
it
in
any
other
way,
undermines
the
rules
of
--
that
were
established
with
respect
to
the
fifth
amendment
in
the
series
of
cases
prior
to
this.
so
we
come
to
determine
what
--
how
that
missing
link
affects
these
rights.
it
is
our
position
that
the
fifth
amendment
right
is
the
same
here
as
it
has
been
in
prior
cases.
although
the
very
words
of
the
section
which
provide
the
criminal
penalty
do
not
include
the
provisions
requiring
the
information,
the
rest
of
the
statute
requires
the
incriminatory
information
and
on
the
congressional
scheme,
it
must
be
interpreted
as
a
whole.
thus,
if
the
defendant
receives
the
order
form
as
has
been
stated
by
the
government,
he
must
give
the
information.
his
position
then
is
no
different
if
he
doesn’t
ask
for
it
with
the
knowledge
that
if
he
receives
it,
he
will
have
to
supply
the
incriminating
information.
he
merely
can
stop,
as
this
court
has
said
previously
at
the
initial
stages
of
the
proceeding,
rather
than
waiting
until
other
statutes
come
in
to
play
in
a
different
factual
context.
the
government
has
indicated
in
its
argument
that
the
application
of
the
order
form
procedure
to
the
heroin
transaction.
the
order
form
procedure
has
its
purpose
the
disclosure
of
information
as
applied
to
the
heroin
transaction.
this
must
always
result
in
the
disclosure
of
incriminating
information
as
to
the
seller.
we
are
not
concerned
here
with
the
purchaser.
the
effect
of
section
4705
is
to
give
the
transaction
an
appearance
of
legality.
since
it
says
that
a
sale
can
be
made
with
an
order
form,
while
the
provision
--
while
the
sale
may
be
illegal
under
other
sections
that
is
precisely
the
problem
raised
by
falling
into
4705
(a).
the
transaction
appears
to
be
legal
and
complying
with
it
appears
to
make
it
justifiable
and
legal
at
the
same
time
complying
with
it
reveals
the
violations
of
the
other
statutes
which
would
be
violated
by
heroin
transaction.
again
i
can
only
indicate
that
the
missing
link
is
not
substantial
because
compliance
in
the
receipt
of
the
order
form
cannot
be
separated
because
of
the
congressional
intent
with
the
statute
from
the
information
giving
aspects
of
the
statute.
even
though
another
statute
may
come
into
play
in
a
different
factual
context,
and
that
other
statute
may
also
violate
the
fifth
amendment,
this
statute
does
too
if
we
look
at
the
full
implications
of
compliance
with
it.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no,
i
don’t
your
honor,
because
that
statute
does
not
make
his
--
does
not
give
his
act
in
appearance
of
legality
by
indicating
that
he
has
violated
some
other
statute.
if
he
were
to
file
such
an
affidavit,
he
would
be
practicing
law
illegally
because
it
had
not
been
properly
admitted.
but
it
wouldn’t,
the
statute
itself
would
not
compel
him
to
reveal
information
which
would
violate
another
statute,
which
would
indicate
a
violation
of
another
statute.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes,
but
that’s
not
this
case
where
it
permits
him
make
the
sale,
if
he
reveals
information
which
would
indicate
a
violation
of
other
statutes.
