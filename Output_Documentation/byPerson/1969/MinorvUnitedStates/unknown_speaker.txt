unknown
speaker
and
still
mrs.
bamberger,
it’s
true
that
the
identity
of
the
seller,
he
has
to
fill
in
the
quantity
of
stuff
himself,
and
supplied
by
the
purchaser
not
by
seller,
isn’t
it?
isn’t
that
the
crucial
thing
from
the
standpoint
of
the
case
which
you
are
relying
on?
unknown
speaker
right.
but
if
the
form
reached
some
of
the
authority’s
direction
in
some
way
with
the
information
only
the
order
form
goes
on
the
seller’s
supplied
and
a
lot
of
information
without
indicating
any
identity
of
the
seller,
isn’t
it?
that’d
be
the
only
thing
liable.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
filed
by
whom?
unknown
speaker
that’s’
another
--
that’s
an
independent
requirement.
unknown
speaker
that
he
had
filed?
unknown
speaker
he
hasn’t
been
prosecuted
for
that
isn’t
he,
for
failing
to
file?
unknown
speaker
he’s
being
prosecuted
for
selling
without
receiving
an
order
form?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
might
mean
he
couldn’t
be
prosecuted
for
failing
to
fill
it
out
and
file.
that
doesn’t
mean
he
can’t
be
prosecuted
for
and
perhaps
not
getting
order
form
at
all?
unknown
speaker
the
law
requires
and
not
the
seller
about
receiving
an
order
form?
unknown
speaker
and
after
he
receives
it,
he
is
supposed
to
fill
it
up.
unknown
speaker
and
he
is
prosecuted
for
not
receiving
the
order
form
alone?
unknown
speaker
receiving
an
order
form
doesn’t
incriminate
at
all?
unknown
speaker
--
incriminated
anything
except
at
all
that
he
filed.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
exactly
is
the
form?
unknown
speaker
what
exactly
is
the
form
are
you
receiving?
unknown
speaker
you
send
that
form
to
someone.
unknown
speaker
which
requires
him
to
tell
whether
he
has
to
purchase
something,
is
that
what
you’re
saying?
unknown
speaker
i
take
that
there’re
some
buyers
who
could
really
get
order
forms
and
present
them
for
selling.
unknown
speaker
and
there
are
some
situations
in
which
sellers
would
put
in
legally
and
without
incriminating
himself,
fill
out
the
forms
for
filing.
unknown
speaker
there
are
people
who
can
get
order
forms.
unknown
speaker
but
it
requires
him
to
make
a
report
with
reference
to
heroin
at
that?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
just
the
sale
of
heroin?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
it
does
include
heroin.
unknown
speaker
even
though
if
in
fact,
this
order
form
was
able
to
use
and
completed
everything
else?
the
subject
being
heroin,
he
might
have
been
prosecuted
under
what?
unknown
speaker
is
it
the
government’s
practice
to
prosecute
these
heroin
sales
where
no
order
form
is
used
under
4705
(a)?
unknown
speaker
but
i
take
it
you
already
told
us
even
if
they
had
used
the
order
form,
nevertheless,
both
purchaser
and
seller
could’ve
been
prosecuted
for
other
offenses.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
do
they
add,
what
s
the
practice
of
adding
in
the
way
of
other
counts
when
they
prosecute
a
heroin
sale
without
an
order
form
under
4705
(a),
what
others
to
they
add?
unknown
speaker
they
added
something
here,
as
i
recall
it.
there
was
another
one
was
it?
it
was
another
count
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
oh,
is
that
right,
i
see.
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
a
practice,
isn’t
not?
unknown
speaker
what
if
seller
received
an
order
form
and
then
failed
to
fill
it
out
but
made
the
sale,
could
he
be
prosecuted
under
4705?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
not
the
--
unknown
speaker
but
not
the
section
that
is
used
here
against
the
seller.
unknown
speaker
did
you
say
earlier
that
all
traffic
in
heroin
is
illegal
to
anybody?
unknown
speaker
it’s
not
included
in
narcotic
drugs
as
defined
in
section
4731?
unknown
speaker
no,
it’s
not
i
wasn’t
able
to
--
unknown
speaker
from
what
you
told
me,
there
will
be
no
order
form
for
heroin
because
all
sales
would
be
prohibited
unless
license
by
the
secretary?
unknown
speaker
well,
it’s
a
--
i
say
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
order
form
is
irrelevant
then
in
your
analysis
to
this
little
problem?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
whole
thing
is
illegal.
i
don’t
see
how
order
form
has
anything
to
do
with
it?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
unknown
speaker
in
connection
about
your
answer
to
justice
douglas.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
order
from
the
secretary
is
irrelevant?
unknown
speaker
now
the
indictment
charges
that
the
defendant
unlawfully,
willfully,
and
knowing
he
did
sell,
barter,
exchange
and
give
away
to
gozon
approximately
19,500
grams
of
heroin
hydrochloride,
a
narcotic
drug,
and
that
the
said
sale,
barter,
exchange
and
giving
away
was
not
in
pursuant
for
the
written
order
of
the
said
francisco
h.
gozon
on
a
form
issued
in
blank
for
that
purpose
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
or
his
delegate.
what
does
that
mean?
unknown
speaker
but
not
for
the
purpose
of
engaging
in
the
purchase
of
heroin?
that’s
what
you
told
me.
unknown
speaker
but
i
understood
you
to
tell
justice
douglas
that
that
was
wholly
irrelevant
because
he
couldn’t
issue
one
for
the
purchase
of
heroin.
unknown
speaker
could
not
legally
be
used?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
and
if
he
used
them,
he
would
show
that
he’s
violating
the
law,
wouldn’t
he?
unknown
speaker
what
about
your
prosecuting
the
other
seller,
aren’t
you?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
however
the
only
the
purchaser
could
be
prosecuted,
but
you’re
prosecuting
the
seller.
unknown
speaker
only
the
man
who
did
it
without
this
order
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
or
whatever
he
is.
unknown
speaker
would
you
mind
to
name
it,
the
distinguishing
between
narcotic
drugs
and
heroin?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
it
doesn’t,
but
this
case
is
heroin.
unknown

and
