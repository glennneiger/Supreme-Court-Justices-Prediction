justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he’s
charged
with
selling
without
filing.
the
charge
is
selling.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
his
only
defense
is
that
if
he
filed
the
order
form,
he’ll
incriminate
somebody.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
didn’t
initiate.
he
initiated
the
selling
of
the
drug.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
what
he
was
doing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
i
understand
you
that
to
obtain
them
would
incriminate
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
let’s
assume
he
had
applied
for
the
order
form,
period.
justice
thurgood
marshall
period,
that’s
all.
could
he
be
convicted
of
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
right.
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
he
applies
for
the
order
form
and
makes
the
sale,
then
what
happens?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
rights
have
been
violated
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
he
be
even
charged
with
not
filling
out
the
form,
or
charged
with
selling
without
it?
what
would
he
be
charged
with?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
he
were
not
in
the
business
and
was
contemplating
going
in
business
and
got
the
form,
how
could
he
be
incriminated
because
he
might
change
his
mind
and
not
go
into
business.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
maybe
i
didn’t
make
myself
clear.
he
is
thinking
about
changing
his
business
from
gambling
to
selling
dope
so
he
applies
for
the
blank,
and
after
he
applies
to
the
blank,
people
who
have
learned
their
lessons
say,
“man
that’s
not
the
business
to
get
into.”
and
that’s
--
he
decides
not
to
buy
any
dope
and
not
to
sell
any
dope.
has
he
been
injured?
justice
thurgood
marshall
has
he
committed
any
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
both
don’t
decide
not
to
go
into
business.
the
buyer
decides
to
quit
and
the
seller
decides
not
to
sell.
he’s
not
incriminated,
is
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
my
whole
point
is
just
the
picking
up
of
this
the
order
blank,
that’s
the
part
i
have
trouble
with
that
that
in
and
of
itself
is
self-incriminating.
that’s
the
only
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
now
the
difference
between
that
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
didn’t
order
the
blank
either.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
pay
$100.00
an
ounce?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
against
the
order
form
and
fills
it
out,
has
he
incriminated
himself
if
he
does
nothing
more
than
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
he
takes
the
order
form
and
fills
out
and
does
nothing
more.
justice
thurgood
marshall
has
either,
have
either
been
incriminated?
justice
thurgood
marshall
incrimination
comes
when
you
sell
the
drug.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
they
don't
engage
in
the
criminal
activities,
are
they
injured?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
is
--
how
is
the
filling
out
of
the
blank
in
and
off
itself
without
more
incriminating?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
use
of
phrase
we
sometime
use,
what
triggers
all
of
it
is
this
buying
or
selling
of
the
marihuana.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
a
$100.00
an

your
idea
of
a

justice
thurgood
