chief

well,
you’re
speculation
on
a
future
possibility
which
isn’t

chief

et

put
a
hypothetical
question
to
you,
mrs.
bamberger.
suppose
a
state
decided
to
simplify
its
procedures,
and
perhaps
this
hypothetical
is
too
simplistic
but
let’s
try
it.
simplify
its
procedures
for
admission
of
lawyers
from
other
states
who
moved
into
the
state
in
question
and
said
that
admission
to
the
bar
could
be
obtained
upon
filing
a
certificate
by
the
applicant
that
he
was
admitted
a
bar
in
some
other
state
giving
the
date
of
his
admission
of
the
details.
the
man
wants
to
practice
in
this
state,
but
he
hasn’t
had
time
to
go
to
law
school
and
he
doesn’t
want
to
take
the
trouble
and
so
he
just
--
but
he’s
determined
to
practice
law
there.
now,
he
says
he’s
confronted
with
the
choice
of
either
committing
perjury
by
filing
a
false
certificate
that
he
submitted
in
florida
or
georgia,
or
not
engaging
in
practice
of
law
at
all.
would
you
think
that
that
kind
of
a
statute
poses
these
problems?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
confronts
him
with
the
choice
that
either
not
being
able
to
practice
law
in
that
state
or
committing
perjury
in
order
to
get
this
simplified
overnight
admission.
chief

well,
isn't
it
the
paper,
the
form,
the
filling
out
of
the
form
plus
and
overt
act
that
makes
the
criminal
offense
here?
chief

warren
e.
burger
but
as
justice
marshall
just
suggested,
the
piece
of
paper
alone
filled
out
and
signed
doesn't
incriminate
the
man
at
all,
does
it?
chief

warren
e.

would
there
be
any
occasion
for
him
to
testify

he
did
was
fill
out
the
form?
chief
justice
warren

i'm
talking
about

the

you

left.
chief

in

when

called
on
him
and
ask
for
its
exhibition,
he
simply
stood
on
his
claim
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
decline
to
do
it
and
proceeded
to
test
it
out?
chief

and
are
you
suggesting
that
the

has
no
legitimate

that
simply
