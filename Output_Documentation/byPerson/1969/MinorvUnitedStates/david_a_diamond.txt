mr.
david
a.
diamond
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
application
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
as
developed
in
the
marchetti,
grosso
and
haynes
and
most
recently,
the
leary
case,
to
the
situation
of
a
transferor
of
marihuana
pursuant
to
the
transfer,
order
form
requirements
of
the
marihuana
tax
statutes.
briefly,
the
facts
of
this
case
are
that
the
petitioner
was
introduced
by
a
friend
to
two
federal
narcotics
agents
acting
in
an
under
cover
capacity.
he
had
no
--
they
had
no
knowledge
of
his
existence
prior
to
the
introduction.
they
were
introduced
to
him
simply
as
mike,
the
petitioner's
first
name.
as
a
result
of
the
introduction
there
were
various
sales
of
marihuana
and
marihuana
drugs.
the
sales
were
made
not
in
pursuance
of
an
order
form
issued
by
the
treasurer
of
the
united
states
as
required
by
26
u.s.c.
section
4742.
petitioner
did
not
request
an
order
form
from
the
agents,
the
agents
had
not
procured
such
an
order
form.
petitioner
was
indicted
on
three
counts,
two
of
which
were
selling,
not
in
pursuance
of
an
order
form
and
was
convicted
on
one
count,
not
selling
pursuant
to
an
order
form.
the
case
was
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit
relying
solely
on
united
states
against
minor.
the
second
circuit
held
that
the
marihuana
statute,
the
marihuana
tax
statute
was
for
practical
purposes,
the
same
as
the
narcotic
drug
act
involved
in
minor
that
there
was
no
risk
of
self-incrimination
to
a
transferor
and
that
the
transferor
of
marihuana
was
not
a
person
inherently
suspect
of
criminal
activities
and
that
the
profession
of
transferring
marihuana
or
being
involved
in
marihuana
transactions
was
not
an
inherently
suspect
and
illegitimate
business.
this
was
not
a
statute
designed
to
close
down
a
criminal
activity
but
rather
to
regulate
a
legitimate
activity.
briefly,
the
marihuana
tax
act
statutory
scheme
consists
of
an
occupational
tax
provision,
series
of
provisions
requiring
any
transferor
of
marihuana,
anyone
who
deals
in
marihuana
which
is
defined
as
to
very
broadly
and
includes
selling
it
or
giving
away,
to
register
as
a
dealer,
to
pay
an
occupational
tax
and
to
keep
records
his
transactions.
there
is
also
a
transfer
tax
provision
which
requires
a
transferee,
a
purchaser
or
acquirer
of
marihuana
to
obtain
an
order
from
the
treasurer
of
the
united
states.
he
must
in
it
pay
in
advance
the
tax
on
the
material
to
be
acquired,
the
tax
is
either
at
the
rate
of
$1.00
an
ounce
or
$100.00
an
ounce
depending
upon
whether
the
transferee
is
himself
registered.
he
pays
the
tax
based
upon
the
amount
he
intends
to
acquire.
in
order
for
him
to
acquire
that
order
form,
he
must
place
on
file
with
the
government
prior
to
obtaining
the
form
and
prior
to
consummating
the
transaction,
his
own
name
and
address
and
the
name
and
address
of
his
proposed
transferor
as
well
as
the
amount
of
the
drug
he
proposes
to
transfer.
there
are
numerous
exemptions
from
the
order
form
requirement
and
as
the
court
noted
in
leary,
they
are
essentially
all
of
the
legitimate
transactions
that
are
involved
in
marihuana,
transverse
by
doctors
to
patients
by
pharmacist
to
costumers
pursuant
to
doctor's
orders,
by
officials
of
the
government,
transactions
for
export,
so
that
there
is
left
subject
to
the
order
form
requirement
a
residual
class
of
essentially
of
illegal
transactions.
the
information
obtained
by
the
order
form,
he
is
given
copies
of
the
order
form
are
made
available
to
any
state
or
local
official
who
is
concerned
officially
with
the
enforcement
of
local
narcotics
laws.
the
mere
possession
of
marihuana
is
illegal
in
every
state
of
the
union
with
certain
very
limited
exceptions
corresponding
largely
to
the
exemptions
of
the
order
form
requirements
under
section
4742.
the
leary
case
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
no.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
no,
any
person
may
obtain
an
order
form.
the
marihuana
statutes
differ
radically
from
the
narcotic
statutes
in
this
regard.
any
person
desiring
to
acquire
an
order
form
may
acquire
it
if
he
is
a
so
called
legitimate
purchaser,
one
who
is
registered
under
the
occupational
tax
sections.
he
pays
$1.00
per
ounce.
if
he
is
an
illegitimate
purchaser,
one
who
is
not
registered,
he
pays
$100.00
an
ounce,
but
any
person
off
the
street
who
wants
to
acquire
marihuana
for
smoking
or
any
other
purpose
may
acquire
an
order
form.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
and
pay
$100.00
an
ounce,
yes
sir.
the
leary
case,
leary
case
involve
such
a
--
such
a
purchaser.
the
leary
case
held
that
the
marihuana
statute,
the
transfer
of
provisions
as
applied
to
an
unregistered
transferee,
who
was
leary,
applied
to
a
person
inherently
suspect
of
criminal
activities
and
existed
in
an
area
permeated
with
criminal
statutes
particularly
by
virtue
of
the
exposure
of
the
information
contained
on
the
order
form
to
the
state
authorities.
it
held
therefore
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
applied.
the
court
in
leary
also
refused
to
severe
the
statute
so
as
to
make
the
order
form
provision
applicable
but
withdraw
the
information
from
the
perusal
of
the
states.
it
also
applied
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
to
prospective
act
since
in
the
leary
case,
the
purchaser
acquired
the
order
form
prior
to
time
that
any
paying
transaction
was
consummated.
the
petitioner
here
contends
that
the
leary
reasoning
applies
fully
to
his
--
to
the
position
of
a
transferor
of
marihuana.
under
the
same
order
form
procedure,
the
acts
required
of
the
transferor
in
order
to
comply
with
the
provisions
of
4742
yield
an
even
greater
danger
than
they
did
to
the
transferee
of
marihuana.
i
review
briefly
the
acts
which
we
consider
to
constitute
the
self-incrimination
aspects
of
this
thing
in
terms
of
the
transferor.
there
are
four
acts,
some
or
all
of
which
maybe
present
with
respect
to
any
particular
transaction
in
relation
to
marihuana
on
the
part
of
the
transferor.
the
act
in
effect,
the
act
--
i
may
note
again
that
the
name
and
address
of
the
transferor
must
be
on
file
with
the
government
prior
to
the
consummation
of
the
transaction.
the
mechanism
provided
by
the
statute
is
the
use
of
the
transferee.
the
transferee
must
procure
the
order
form
and
give
the
information
directly
to
the
government.
we
maintain
however
that
the
statutory
scheme
envisions
the
transferee
as
a
conduit
for
the
transfer
of
the
required
information
to
the
government,
which
information
demands
acts
on
the
part
of
the
transferor
incriminating
to
himself.
he
must,
knowing
that
the
information
is
to
go
to
the
government
and
that
it
is
incriminating
to
him
provide
information.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
correct.
the
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
correct.
in
addition,
the
general
structure
of
the
form
is
a
directive
to
the
transferor
but
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
to
the
seller
from
the
government
authorizing
him
so
far
as
federal
act
is
concerned
to
transfer
certain
quantity
of
marihuana
to
specified
transferee.
again,
the
transferee
is
the
government's
conduit
for
sending
this
form
to
the
transferor.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
he
hasn't
at
that
point
but
we
contend
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
the
information
goes
to
the
government
through
the
hand
of
the
transferee.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
no,
there's
nothing
illegal,
there's
no
privilege
itself
against
self-incrimination
without
the
half
of
the
transferee
in
relation
to
the
transferor's
name.
however,
there
are
other
acts
required,
assuming
that
the
transferee
finds
the
name
independent
of
the
transferor
and
delivers
it
independent
to
the
--
independently
to
the
government,
and
i
may
note
in
passing
that
the
name
was
not
revealed
so
far
as
this
record
is
concerned
to
the
transferee
by
the
transferor.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
no.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
correct.
the
seller
and
he
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
right.
the
seller
and
the
buyers
were
strangers,
they
were
introduced
by
a
third
party
solely
on
the
basis
of
first
names,
that
is
in
the
record.
however,
once
the
transferee
has
obtained
an
order
form,
the
transferor
must
accept
that
order
form.
we
contend
that
the
act
of
acceptance
is
an
acknowledgement
and
an
adaptation
of
the
information
contained
on
the
order
form.
the
informa
--
the
order
form
is
an
inherently
incriminating
device
when
it
contains
the
information
that
the
transferor
has
sold
certain
drugs
illegally
to
a
transferee,
when
the
transferor
accepts
that
piece
of
paper,
even
when,
if
he
were
to
refuse
to
accept
it,
if
he
were
to
ask
about
its
existence,
if
he
were
to
learn
of
the
existence
of
this
piece
of
paper
and
then
transfer
drugs
pursuant
to
it,
he
would
be
adopting
the
information
on
that
paper
as
his
own
as
being
true
and
valid.
the
statute
requires
him
to
participate
to
a
great
extent
in
the
incriminatory
act
involved
in
the
order
form
process.
it
is
--
in
our
mind,
it
is
the
same
thing
as
signing
a
confession
that
someone
else
has
typed.
the
information
may
already
be
in
the
possession
of
someone
else
but
when
you
take
it
as
your
own,
you
are
acknowledging
it
as
true,
when
it
is
possible
although
for
practical
reasons
very
unlikely
that
a
transferee
might
obtain
an
order
form
without
ever
speaking
to
anyone.
obviously,
at
that
point,
nothing
has
been
done
by
the
transferor
to
incriminate
himself.
when
he
accepts
the
piece
of
paper,
he
has
enabled
the
transferee
to
say
when
asked,
i
gave
this
piece
of
paper
to
the
buyer
and
he
accepted
it
assuming
that
the
buyer
would
tell
the
truth,
we
cannot
postulate
that
the
statute
will
be
maintained
on
the
basis
of
the
seller's
purgery,
assuming
that
the
seller
would
tell
that
truth
when
asked,
he
would
be
required
to
say
that
he
accepted
this
piece
of
paper.
in
addition,
he
is
required
by
the
statute
to
retain
the
piece
of
paper
which
constitutes
an
additional
piece
of
evidence
of
his
criminal
act
for
two
years
and
to
make
it
available
to
all
law
enforcement
officials
who
might
come
to
ask
for
it
in
that
two
years.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
4742.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
4742
(a)
is
the
general
requirement
that
you
may
not
transfer
marihuana
except
pursuant
to
an
order
form.
the
provisions
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
i
--
insofar
as
the
order
form,
the
mechanism
for
the
order
--
for
obtaining
the
order
form
is
provision
(c)
and
(d)
of
the
--
of
4742
and
insofar
as
the
order
form
requires
that
information
be
on
file
which
is
incriminating
at
the
time
of
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
the
use
of
an
order
form
by
itself,
no.
if
this
were
to
be
an
order
form
of
the
sort
contained
in
the
narcotic
--
narcotic
drug
statute,
then
we
would
feel
that
the
buyer
was
incriminated,
i'm
sorry,
the
seller,
the
transferor
would
be
incriminated
by
requiring
that
such
a
statute
exist,
such
an
order
form
exist.
the
theory
of
it
in
the
narcotic
drug
case
is
i
believe
that
the
act,
the
order
form
requirement
is
to
see
to
it
that
unlawful
people
do
not
obtain
narcotic
drugs,
that
result
is
perfected
by
requiring
the
name
and
address
of
the
buyer,
of
the
transferee
to
be
in
the
hands
of
government
prior
to
the
sale
or
of
issuing
order
forms
only
to
legitimate
people.
but
in
this
case,
the
form
does
require
that
the
name
and
address
of
the
transferor
be
in
the
hands
of
government
prior
to
sale.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
the
transferor
does
not
obtain
the
order
form
and
does
not
fill
it
out.
the
transferee
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
--
obtains
the
order
form
and
fills
it
out.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
has
the
transferor
incriminated
himself?
mr.
david
a.
diamond
if
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
the
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
the
information
in
the
hands
of
the
government
directs
the
attention
of
the
government
to
a
group
of
people
who
are
suspect
and
very
strongly
suspected
of
criminal
activity.
even
the
focus
of
their
attention
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
they
would
presumably
then
be
able
to
refute
the
implication
that
arises
from
the
existence
of
the
order
form.
it
some
--
seem
some
question
is
to
whether
the
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
i
think
that
there's
a
very
heavy
presumption
that
that
blank
would
not
be
filled
out
where
the
transaction
not
going
to
be
completed.
among
other
things,
the
tax
must
be
paid
prior
to
the
filling
out
of
the
form,
that
is
at
the
time,
you
cannot
obtain
the
form
without
paying
the
tax.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
it
is
all,
yes,
if
one
were
not
interested
in
buying
or
selling
marihuana,
one
would
not
deal
with
this
forms
at
all.
however,
the
danger,
the
suspicion
intended
by
the
existence
of
the
form
is
such
that
the
--
i
think
the
existence
of
the
form
would
cause
the
attention
of
the
authorities
to
be
focused
very
closely
upon
this
people.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
the
offense
is
the
overt
act
or
the
overt
act
in
the
absence
of
the
piece
of
paper.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
if
the
transaction
were
to
have
gone
no
further
than
that,
then
i
believe
it
would
be
incriminating
and
that
the
statute
provides
that
the
piece
of
paper
maybe
used
as
evidence
and
existence
of
the
piece
of
paper
may
serve
to
bring
into
initiation
the
process
of
prosecution
in
relation
to
a
drug,
and
now
presumably
the
transferor
who
did
not
transfer
but
is
simply
named
as
a
transferor
would
be
able
to
testify
that
he
did
not
in
fact
ever
commit
any
act
of
this
sort
and
were
he
to
be
believed
than
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
the
transferor
does
not
fill
out
the
form
in
this
case,
the
transferee
only.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
this
court
in
leary
considered
that
the
correlation
between
the
act
of
filling
out
the
form
and
the
act
of
selling
or
buying
the
drug
was
so
close
that
it
viewed
the
existence
of
the
form
as
being
evidence
of
a
recent
--
of
being
a
recent
transferee
of
marihuana,
even
though
the
existence
of
the
form
did
not
necessarily
imply
that
any
transaction
had
been
completed
at
all.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
correct.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
correct.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
yes
he
does.
that
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
nothing,
except
that
i
believe
that
one
has
to
assume
that
the
process
is
going
to
be
--
if
it
is
to
be
followed,
it's
going
to
be
followed
as
required
by
the
statute.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
nothing
is
to
prevent
him
from
skipping
the
order
form
completely
but
one
would
assume
that
he
in
obeying
the
law,
is
going
to
do
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
any
person,
any
person
may
acquire.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
if
he
has
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
he
gives
the
name
and
address
of
the
vendor,
of
the
proposed
vendor.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
nothing,
nothing.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
nothing.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
i
think
that
with
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
correct
but
i
think
that
we
have
to
assume
that
this
is
a
process
that
people
will
follow
if
they
are
going
to
follow
it
all
in
the
way
that
it's
required.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
right.
now,
if
the
propose
transferor
accept
this
order
form,
he
is
acknowledging
the
truth
of
the
information
contained
on
the
order
form,
that
is
that
he,
the
perspective
of
the
proposed
transferor
has
transferred
to
this
transferee
the
specified
quantities
of
marihuana.
at
that
time,
he
has
committed
a
self
incriminatory
act.
in
addition,
he
must
retain
that
form
for
two
years
to
serve
as
further
evidence.
in
connection
with
obtaining
the
order
form,
the
leary
case
held
that
a
transferee
need
no
--
an
unregistered
transferee
is
protected
against
obtaining
the
order
form
because
it
is
self-incriminatory
for
him
to
do
so.
this
makes
it
very
unlikely
that
an
illegal
transferee
will
obtain
the
order
for
to
give
to
a
transferor
unless
the
transferor
insists
upon
it.
we
maintain
that
if
this
statute
is
to
be
taken
as
written
and
interpreted
by
this
court,
that
a
major
part
of
the
motivating
power
for
getting
the
information
into
the
hand
of
the
government
who
will
use
it
to
the
detriment
of
the
transferor
must
come
from
the
transferor
himself.
a
transferor
--
a
transferee
under
the
present
state
of
the
law
is
very,
very
unlikely
to
procure
an
order
form
unless
the
transferor
simply
insists
upon
it.
it
cannot
under
these
circumstances
say
that
the
transferor
is
a
passive
party
who
need
only
inquire
whether
the
order
form
exist.
if
the
order
form
is
to
exist,
it
must
be
because
the
transferor
brings
it
about
that
it
exist
even
though
he
himself
does
not
ever
go
the
treasury
department
and
sign
his
name
on
a
piece
of
paper.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
he
must
see
to
it
that
the
piece
of
paper
exist
when
the
order
--
when
the
transaction
is
completed.
if
he
does
not
see
to
it,
it
is
very
unlikely
either
because
the
transferee
will
be
incapable
of
doing
it
because
he
does
not
know
the
information,
that
is
the
transferor
has
not
given
him
his
name
and
address
or
because
he
does
not
desire
to
do
it.
it
is
very
unlikely
for
either
of
those
reasons
that
a
transferee
will
obtain
the
order
form.
if
an
order
form
is
to
come
into
existence,
it
must
be
because
the
transferor
has
provided
the
primary
motivation
for
its
coming
into
existence.
he
must
affirmatively
act
to
his
own
detriment.
the
--
we
maintain
that
the
self-incrimination
comes
about
through
a
conduit
that
the
statute
has
provided.
the
transferee
is
in
effect
the
government
itself
for
purposes
of
dealing
with
the
transferor
and
procuring
the
order
form.
the
transferee
would
not
itself
would
not
itself
procure
the
order
form
if
the
transferor
did
not
insist
upon
it.
in
that
way,
the
transfer
--
the
transferor
must
see
to
his
own
incrimination
with
the
government.
in
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
yes.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
correct.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
correct,
although
we
maintain
that
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
the
order
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
the
order
form
would
not
have
been
obtained
unless
he
saw
it
that
it
was
obtained.
if
he
had
insisted
that
the
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
in
this
particular
case
he
did
not
and
it
now
true
that
buyers
are
not
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
the
name
was
never
furnished.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
the
seller
never
incriminated
the
buyer
because
buyer
did
not
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
but,
but
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
but,
but
that's
not
only
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
but
he
exposes
himself
to
conviction
under
all
the
states
statute,
whatever
state
statute
is
relevant
and
to
another
provision
of
the
statute
which
makes
it
illegal
for
him
to
be
a
transferor
of
marihuana
without
being
registered.
our
--
the
petitioner
here
was
an
unregistered
transferor
and
he
is
an
inherently
suspect
person.
if
his
name
appeared
on
a
piece
of
paper
in
the
hands
of
the
government
as
a
transferor,
he
would
be
immediately
a
suspect.
if
he
saw
to
it
that
the
transferee
procured
such
a
piece
of
paper,
he
would
be
seeing
to
his
own
incrimination
in
the
eyes
of
the
government.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
if
there
had
been
an
order
form,
the
incriminatory
act
would
have
been
completed.
as
soon
as
he
received
the
order
form
or
learned
of
its
existence
and
then
transferred
marihuana
pursuant
to
it.
there
was
no
order
form
in
the
leary
case
either
and
there
were
no
registration
forms
in
the
marchetti,
grosso,
and
haynes
cases.
the
point
is
that
filling
out
the
order
form
or
acting
pursuant
to
the
order
form
in
this
case
is
in
itself
the
incriminatory
act.
in
leary,
the
incrimination
that
the
dangerous
incrimination
was
at
the
hands
of
the
state,
not
at
the
hand
of
the
federal
government
and
the
information
came
to
the
state
authorities,
not
from
leary
himself
but
from
the
federal
government.
leary
provided
the
information
only
to
the
federal
government
who
then
provided
it
to
other
people
who
would
incriminate,
who
would
indict
and
convict
leary,
this
was
dealt
to
be
too
dangerous.
i
would
like
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
narcotic
drug
act
and
the
marihuana
act.
under
the
marihuana
act,
there
are
virtually
no
legitimate
users
of
marihuana.
there
were
in
the
last
published
reports
80
registered
people,
people
who
could
deal
legitimately
with
marihuana.
i'm
informed
by
counsel
for
the
government
that
that
number
is
now
approximately
160,
but
it
compares
insignificantly
to
the
approximately
200,000
registered
people
involved
in
the
narcotic
drug
trade,
this
is
an
illegal
activity
and
this
is
a
set
of
statutes
intended
to
cause
people
to
expose
themselves
as
being
dealers
in
illegal
activities.
i'll
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
may
it
please
the
court.
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
i
believe
that
acceptance
of
the
order
form
does
more
than
acknowledge
the
man's
name,
that
acknowledges
the
fact
that
he
has
transferred
a
stated
quantity
of
marihuana
and
if
he
is
an
illegal
transferor
as
was
the
petitioner
here
and
is
--
as
would
be
virtually
anyone
prosecuted
under
this
act,
he
would
be
acknowledging
that
he
has
broken
the
law.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
he
must
acknowledge
it
to
any
person
who
comes
to
inquire
of
any
official
who
comes
to
inquire
about
this
matter.
i
believe
that
he
acknowledges
it
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
right
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
right,
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
he
has
put
himself
in
the
position
of
being
required
to
acknowledge
it
to
the
various
state
officials
who
come
around
as
a
result
of
that
order
form.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
i
believe
that
it
is
the
obligation
to
which
this
statute
looks,
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
buyer's
name
on
the
order
form
is
to
deal
with
the
second
purpose
stated
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
act,
that
is
to
expose
all
details
of
marihuana
transactions
to
the
scrutiny
both
of
the
federal
and
state
officers.
if
this
--
if
the
purpose
of
this
transfer
of
provision
was
only
to
prevent
transfers
to
unlawful
people,
the
buyer's
name
would
be
irrelevant.
the
purpose
is
to
expose
the
existence
of
the
seller
as
well
as
the
buyer
to
all
scrutiny
which
may
follow
the
coming
into
existence
of
the
order
form.
i
believe
that
there
cannot
be
any
segregation
of
this
statute
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
to
any
official
of
the
state,
local,
or
federal
official
who
comes
around,
he
must
produce
his
copy
the
order
form.
it
would
be
a
frivolous
i
think
for
him
to
say
something
like
at
that
point
he
need
not
expose
it,
there
would
be
no
purpose
in
his
having
to
take
it
in
the
first
place
if
he
didn't
have
to
display
it
when
the
officials
come
around
since
this
serves
more
than
the
valid
--
possibly
valid
purpose
of
seeing
to
it
that
these
drugs
go
only
to
a
legitimate
purchaser.
they
see
to
it
that
the
seller
is
also
exposed
to
official
scrutiny
and
that
--
that
is
done
by
seeing
to
it
that
he
maintains
a
copy
which
he
reveals
to
appropriate
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
correct.
we
feel
that's
an
integrated,
that's
fruition
of
the
entire
buyer
--
the
entire
seller
information
of
the
transfer
order
provisions
of
the
marihuana
act.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
i
think
that
that
would
be
rendering
the
entire
transfer
provisions
pointless.
there
is
no
point
to
him
taking
the
order
form
at
all
since
the
buyer
part
of
it
is
already
taken
care
of
by
the
buyer's
name
if
the
seller's
point
is
to
have
any
purpose,
it
is
to
expose
and
reveal
the
seller
if
the
seller
were
to
decline
to
disclose
the
order
form
and
he
were
sustained
on
that,
there
would
be
no
point
in
making
him
take
the
order
form
in
the
first
place.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
they
perhaps
do
but
they
may
not
make
the
man
himself,
the
man
incriminate
himself
in
relation
to
that
legitimate
interest.
they
require
him
to
register
and
maintain
records
of
the
different
sort
and
under
different
provisions
under
this
law
and
those
provisions
are
perhaps
valid
but
they
cannot
then
require
that
he
in
effect
commit
another
crime
by
refusing
to
reveal
that
he
has
violated
the
first
position,
the
first
provisions.
we
feel
this
case
comes
directly
under
the
alberts
and
marchetti
very
line.
in
addition,
the
order
form
are
all
used
as
evidence.
the
statute
describes
it
as
such.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
application
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
as
developed
in
the
marchetti,
grosso
and
haynes
and
most
recently,
the
leary
case,
to
the
situation
of
a
transferor
of
marihuana
pursuant
to
the
transfer,
order
form
requirements
of
the
marihuana
tax
statutes.
briefly,
the
facts
of
this
case
are
that
the
petitioner
was
introduced
by
a
friend
to
two
federal
narcotics
agents
acting
in
an
under
cover
capacity.
he
had
no
--
they
had
no
knowledge
of
his
existence
prior
to
the
introduction.
they
were
introduced
to
him
simply
as
mike,
the
petitioner's
first
name.
as
a
result
of
the
introduction
there
were
various
sales
of
marihuana
and
marihuana
drugs.
the
sales
were
made
not
in
pursuance
of
an
order
form
issued
by
the
treasurer
of
the
united
states
as
required
by
26
u.s.c.
section
4742.
petitioner
did
not
request
an
order
form
from
the
agents,
the
agents
had
not
procured
such
an
order
form.
petitioner
was
indicted
on
three
counts,
two
of
which
were
selling,
not
in
pursuance
of
an
order
form
and
was
convicted
on
one
count,
not
selling
pursuant
to
an
order
form.
the
case
was
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit
relying
solely
on
united
states
against
minor.
the
second
circuit
held
that
the
marihuana
statute,
the
marihuana
tax
statute
was
for
practical
purposes,
the
same
as
the
narcotic
drug
act
involved
in
minor
that
there
was
no
risk
of
self-incrimination
to
a
transferor
and
that
the
transferor
of
marihuana
was
not
a
person
inherently
suspect
of
criminal
activities
and
that
the
profession
of
transferring
marihuana
or
being
involved
in
marihuana
transactions
was
not
an
inherently
suspect
and
illegitimate
business.
this
was
not
a
statute
designed
to
close
down
a
criminal
activity
but
rather
to
regulate
a
legitimate
activity.
briefly,
the
marihuana
tax
act
statutory
scheme
consists
of
an
occupational
tax
provision,
series
of
provisions
requiring
any
transferor
of
marihuana,
anyone
who
deals
in
marihuana
which
is
defined
as
to
very
broadly
and
includes
selling
it
or
giving
away,
to
register
as
a
dealer,
to
pay
an
occupational
tax
and
to
keep
records
his
transactions.
there
is
also
a
transfer
tax
provision
which
requires
a
transferee,
a
purchaser
or
acquirer
of
marihuana
to
obtain
an
order
from
the
treasurer
of
the
united
states.
he
must
in
it
pay
in
advance
the
tax
on
the
material
to
be
acquired,
the
tax
is
either
at
the
rate
of
$1.00
an
ounce
or
$100.00
an
ounce
depending
upon
whether
the
transferee
is
himself
registered.
he
pays
the
tax
based
upon
the
amount
he
intends
to
acquire.
in
order
for
him
to
acquire
that
order
form,
he
must
place
on
file
with
the
government
prior
to
obtaining
the
form
and
prior
to
consummating
the
transaction,
his
own
name
and
address
and
the
name
and
address
of
his
proposed
transferor
as
well
as
the
amount
of
the
drug
he
proposes
to
transfer.
there
are
numerous
exemptions
from
the
order
form
requirement
and
as
the
court
noted
in
leary,
they
are
essentially
all
of
the
legitimate
transactions
that
are
involved
in
marihuana,
transverse
by
doctors
to
patients
by
pharmacist
to
costumers
pursuant
to
doctor's
orders,
by
officials
of
the
government,
transactions
for
export,
so
that
there
is
left
subject
to
the
order
form
requirement
a
residual
class
of
essentially
of
illegal
transactions.
the
information
obtained
by
the
order
form,
he
is
given
copies
of
the
order
form
are
made
available
to
any
state
or
local
official
who
is
concerned
officially
with
the
enforcement
of
local
narcotics
laws.
the
mere
possession
of
marihuana
is
illegal
in
every
state
of
the
union
with
certain
very
limited
exceptions
corresponding
largely
to
the
exemptions
of
the
order
form
requirements
under
section
4742.
the
leary
case
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
no.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
no,
any
person
may
obtain
an
order
form.
the
marihuana
statutes
differ
radically
from
the
narcotic
statutes
in
this
regard.
any
person
desiring
to
acquire
an
order
form
may
acquire
it
if
he
is
a
so
called
legitimate
purchaser,
one
who
is
registered
under
the
occupational
tax
sections.
he
pays
$1.00
per
ounce.
if
he
is
an
illegitimate
purchaser,
one
who
is
not
registered,
he
pays
$100.00
an
ounce,
but
any
person
off
the
street
who
wants
to
acquire
marihuana
for
smoking
or
any
other
purpose
may
acquire
an
order
form.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
and
pay
$100.00
an
ounce,
yes
sir.
the
leary
case,
leary
case
involve
such
a
--
such
a
purchaser.
the
leary
case
held
that
the
marihuana
statute,
the
transfer
of
provisions
as
applied
to
an
unregistered
transferee,
who
was
leary,
applied
to
a
person
inherently
suspect
of
criminal
activities
and
existed
in
an
area
permeated
with
criminal
statutes
particularly
by
virtue
of
the
exposure
of
the
information
contained
on
the
order
form
to
the
state
authorities.
it
held
therefore
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
applied.
the
court
in
leary
also
refused
to
severe
the
statute
so
as
to
make
the
order
form
provision
applicable
but
withdraw
the
information
from
the
perusal
of
the
states.
it
also
applied
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
to
prospective
act
since
in
the
leary
case,
the
purchaser
acquired
the
order
form
prior
to
time
that
any
paying
transaction
was
consummated.
the
petitioner
here
contends
that
the
leary
reasoning
applies
fully
to
his
--
to
the
position
of
a
transferor
of
marihuana.
under
the
same
order
form
procedure,
the
acts
required
of
the
transferor
in
order
to
comply
with
the
provisions
of
4742
yield
an
even
greater
danger
than
they
did
to
the
transferee
of
marihuana.
i
review
briefly
the
acts
which
we
consider
to
constitute
the
self-incrimination
aspects
of
this
thing
in
terms
of
the
transferor.
there
are
four
acts,
some
or
all
of
which
maybe
present
with
respect
to
any
particular
transaction
in
relation
to
marihuana
on
the
part
of
the
transferor.
the
act
in
effect,
the
act
--
i
may
note
again
that
the
name
and
address
of
the
transferor
must
be
on
file
with
the
government
prior
to
the
consummation
of
the
transaction.
the
mechanism
provided
by
the
statute
is
the
use
of
the
transferee.
the
transferee
must
procure
the
order
form
and
give
the
information
directly
to
the
government.
we
maintain
however
that
the
statutory
scheme
envisions
the
transferee
as
a
conduit
for
the
transfer
of
the
required
information
to
the
government,
which
information
demands
acts
on
the
part
of
the
transferor
incriminating
to
himself.
he
must,
knowing
that
the
information
is
to
go
to
the
government
and
that
it
is
incriminating
to
him
provide
information.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
correct.
the
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
correct.
in
addition,
the
general
structure
of
the
form
is
a
directive
to
the
transferor
but
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
to
the
seller
from
the
government
authorizing
him
so
far
as
federal
act
is
concerned
to
transfer
certain
quantity
of
marihuana
to
specified
transferee.
again,
the
transferee
is
the
government's
conduit
for
sending
this
form
to
the
transferor.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
he
hasn't
at
that
point
but
we
contend
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
the
information
goes
to
the
government
through
the
hand
of
the
transferee.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
no,
there's
nothing
illegal,
there's
no
privilege
itself
against
self-incrimination
without
the
half
of
the
transferee
in
relation
to
the
transferor's
name.
however,
there
are
other
acts
required,
assuming
that
the
transferee
finds
the
name
independent
of
the
transferor
and
delivers
it
independent
to
the
--
independently
to
the
government,
and
i
may
note
in
passing
that
the
name
was
not
revealed
so
far
as
this
record
is
concerned
to
the
transferee
by
the
transferor.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
no.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
correct.
the
seller
and
he
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
right.
the
seller
and
the
buyers
were
strangers,
they
were
introduced
by
a
third
party
solely
on
the
basis
of
first
names,
that
is
in
the
record.
however,
once
the
transferee
has
obtained
an
order
form,
the
transferor
must
accept
that
order
form.
we
contend
that
the
act
of
acceptance
is
an
acknowledgement
and
an
adaptation
of
the
information
contained
on
the
order
form.
the
informa
--
the
order
form
is
an
inherently
incriminating
device
when
it
contains
the
information
that
the
transferor
has
sold
certain
drugs
illegally
to
a
transferee,
when
the
transferor
accepts
that
piece
of
paper,
even
when,
if
he
were
to
refuse
to
accept
it,
if
he
were
to
ask
about
its
existence,
if
he
were
to
learn
of
the
existence
of
this
piece
of
paper
and
then
transfer
drugs
pursuant
to
it,
he
would
be
adopting
the
information
on
that
paper
as
his
own
as
being
true
and
valid.
the
statute
requires
him
to
participate
to
a
great
extent
in
the
incriminatory
act
involved
in
the
order
form
process.
it
is
--
in
our
mind,
it
is
the
same
thing
as
signing
a
confession
that
someone
else
has
typed.
the
information
may
already
be
in
the
possession
of
someone
else
but
when
you
take
it
as
your
own,
you
are
acknowledging
it
as
true,
when
it
is
possible
although
for
practical
reasons
very
unlikely
that
a
transferee
might
obtain
an
order
form
without
ever
speaking
to
anyone.
obviously,
at
that
point,
nothing
has
been
done
by
the
transferor
to
incriminate
himself.
when
he
accepts
the
piece
of
paper,
he
has
enabled
the
transferee
to
say
when
asked,
i
gave
this
piece
of
paper
to
the
buyer
and
he
accepted
it
assuming
that
the
buyer
would
tell
the
truth,
we
cannot
postulate
that
the
statute
will
be
maintained
on
the
basis
of
the
seller's
purgery,
assuming
that
the
seller
would
tell
that
truth
when
asked,
he
would
be
required
to
say
that
he
accepted
this
piece
of
paper.
in
addition,
he
is
required
by
the
statute
to
retain
the
piece
of
paper
which
constitutes
an
additional
piece
of
evidence
of
his
criminal
act
for
two
years
and
to
make
it
available
to
all
law
enforcement
officials
who
might
come
to
ask
for
it
in
that
two
years.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
4742.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
4742
(a)
is
the
general
requirement
that
you
may
not
transfer
marihuana
except
pursuant
to
an
order
form.
the
provisions
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
i
--
insofar
as
the
order
form,
the
mechanism
for
the
order
--
for
obtaining
the
order
form
is
provision
(c)
and
(d)
of
the
--
of
4742
and
insofar
as
the
order
form
requires
that
information
be
on
file
which
is
incriminating
at
the
time
of
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
the
use
of
an
order
form
by
itself,
no.
if
this
were
to
be
an
order
form
of
the
sort
contained
in
the
narcotic
--
narcotic
drug
statute,
then
we
would
feel
that
the
buyer
was
incriminated,
i'm
sorry,
the
seller,
the
transferor
would
be
incriminated
by
requiring
that
such
a
statute
exist,
such
an
order
form
exist.
the
theory
of
it
in
the
narcotic
drug
case
is
i
believe
that
the
act,
the
order
form
requirement
is
to
see
to
it
that
unlawful
people
do
not
obtain
narcotic
drugs,
that
result
is
perfected
by
requiring
the
name
and
address
of
the
buyer,
of
the
transferee
to
be
in
the
hands
of
government
prior
to
the
sale
or
of
issuing
order
forms
only
to
legitimate
people.
but
in
this
case,
the
form
does
require
that
the
name
and
address
of
the
transferor
be
in
the
hands
of
government
prior
to
sale.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
the
transferor
does
not
obtain
the
order
form
and
does
not
fill
it
out.
the
transferee
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
--
obtains
the
order
form
and
fills
it
out.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
has
the
transferor
incriminated
himself?
mr.
david
a.
diamond
if
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
the
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
the
information
in
the
hands
of
the
government
directs
the
attention
of
the
government
to
a
group
of
people
who
are
suspect
and
very
strongly
suspected
of
criminal
activity.
even
the
focus
of
their
attention
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
they
would
presumably
then
be
able
to
refute
the
implication
that
arises
from
the
existence
of
the
order
form.
it
some
--
seem
some
question
is
to
whether
the
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
i
think
that
there's
a
very
heavy
presumption
that
that
blank
would
not
be
filled
out
where
the
transaction
not
going
to
be
completed.
among
other
things,
the
tax
must
be
paid
prior
to
the
filling
out
of
the
form,
that
is
at
the
time,
you
cannot
obtain
the
form
without
paying
the
tax.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
it
is
all,
yes,
if
one
were
not
interested
in
buying
or
selling
marihuana,
one
would
not
deal
with
this
forms
at
all.
however,
the
danger,
the
suspicion
intended
by
the
existence
of
the
form
is
such
that
the
--
i
think
the
existence
of
the
form
would
cause
the
attention
of
the
authorities
to
be
focused
very
closely
upon
this
people.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
the
offense
is
the
overt
act
or
the
overt
act
in
the
absence
of
the
piece
of
paper.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
if
the
transaction
were
to
have
gone
no
further
than
that,
then
i
believe
it
would
be
incriminating
and
that
the
statute
provides
that
the
piece
of
paper
maybe
used
as
evidence
and
existence
of
the
piece
of
paper
may
serve
to
bring
into
initiation
the
process
of
prosecution
in
relation
to
a
drug,
and
now
presumably
the
transferor
who
did
not
transfer
but
is
simply
named
as
a
transferor
would
be
able
to
testify
that
he
did
not
in
fact
ever
commit
any
act
of
this
sort
and
were
he
to
be
believed
than
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
the
transferor
does
not
fill
out
the
form
in
this
case,
the
transferee
only.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
this
court
in
leary
considered
that
the
correlation
between
the
act
of
filling
out
the
form
and
the
act
of
selling
or
buying
the
drug
was
so
close
that
it
viewed
the
existence
of
the
form
as
being
evidence
of
a
recent
--
of
being
a
recent
transferee
of
marihuana,
even
though
the
existence
of
the
form
did
not
necessarily
imply
that
any
transaction
had
been
completed
at
all.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
correct.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
correct.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
yes
he
does.
that
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
nothing,
except
that
i
believe
that
one
has
to
assume
that
the
process
is
going
to
be
--
if
it
is
to
be
followed,
it's
going
to
be
followed
as
required
by
the
statute.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
nothing
is
to
prevent
him
from
skipping
the
order
form
completely
but
one
would
assume
that
he
in
obeying
the
law,
is
going
to
do
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
any
person,
any
person
may
acquire.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
if
he
has
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
he
gives
the
name
and
address
of
the
vendor,
of
the
proposed
vendor.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
nothing,
nothing.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
nothing.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
i
think
that
with
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
correct
but
i
think
that
we
have
to
assume
that
this
is
a
process
that
people
will
follow
if
they
are
going
to
follow
it
all
in
the
way
that
it's
required.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
right.
now,
if
the
propose
transferor
accept
this
order
form,
he
is
acknowledging
the
truth
of
the
information
contained
on
the
order
form,
that
is
that
he,
the
perspective
of
the
proposed
transferor
has
transferred
to
this
transferee
the
specified
quantities
of
marihuana.
at
that
time,
he
has
committed
a
self
incriminatory
act.
in
addition,
he
must
retain
that
form
for
two
years
to
serve
as
further
evidence.
in
connection
with
obtaining
the
order
form,
the
leary
case
held
that
a
transferee
need
no
--
an
unregistered
transferee
is
protected
against
obtaining
the
order
form
because
it
is
self-incriminatory
for
him
to
do
so.
this
makes
it
very
unlikely
that
an
illegal
transferee
will
obtain
the
order
for
to
give
to
a
transferor
unless
the
transferor
insists
upon
it.
we
maintain
that
if
this
statute
is
to
be
taken
as
written
and
interpreted
by
this
court,
that
a
major
part
of
the
motivating
power
for
getting
the
information
into
the
hand
of
the
government
who
will
use
it
to
the
detriment
of
the
transferor
must
come
from
the
transferor
himself.
a
transferor
--
a
transferee
under
the
present
state
of
the
law
is
very,
very
unlikely
to
procure
an
order
form
unless
the
transferor
simply
insists
upon
it.
it
cannot
under
these
circumstances
say
that
the
transferor
is
a
passive
party
who
need
only
inquire
whether
the
order
form
exist.
if
the
order
form
is
to
exist,
it
must
be
because
the
transferor
brings
it
about
that
it
exist
even
though
he
himself
does
not
ever
go
the
treasury
department
and
sign
his
name
on
a
piece
of
paper.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
he
must
see
to
it
that
the
piece
of
paper
exist
when
the
order
--
when
the
transaction
is
completed.
if
he
does
not
see
to
it,
it
is
very
unlikely
either
because
the
transferee
will
be
incapable
of
doing
it
because
he
does
not
know
the
information,
that
is
the
transferor
has
not
given
him
his
name
and
address
or
because
he
does
not
desire
to
do
it.
it
is
very
unlikely
for
either
of
those
reasons
that
a
transferee
will
obtain
the
order
form.
if
an
order
form
is
to
come
into
existence,
it
must
be
because
the
transferor
has
provided
the
primary
motivation
for
its
coming
into
existence.
he
must
affirmatively
act
to
his
own
detriment.
the
--
we
maintain
that
the
self-incrimination
comes
about
through
a
conduit
that
the
statute
has
provided.
the
transferee
is
in
effect
the
government
itself
for
purposes
of
dealing
with
the
transferor
and
procuring
the
order
form.
the
transferee
would
not
itself
would
not
itself
procure
the
order
form
if
the
transferor
did
not
insist
upon
it.
in
that
way,
the
transfer
--
the
transferor
must
see
to
his
own
incrimination
with
the
government.
in
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
yes.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
correct.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
correct,
although
we
maintain
that
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
the
order
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
the
order
form
would
not
have
been
obtained
unless
he
saw
it
that
it
was
obtained.
if
he
had
insisted
that
the
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
in
this
particular
case
he
did
not
and
it
now
true
that
buyers
are
not
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
the
name
was
never
furnished.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
the
seller
never
incriminated
the
buyer
because
buyer
did
not
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
but,
but
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
but,
but
that's
not
only
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
but
he
exposes
himself
to
conviction
under
all
the
states
statute,
whatever
state
statute
is
relevant
and
to
another
provision
of
the
statute
which
makes
it
illegal
for
him
to
be
a
transferor
of
marihuana
without
being
registered.
our
--
the
petitioner
here
was
an
unregistered
transferor
and
he
is
an
inherently
suspect
person.
if
his
name
appeared
on
a
piece
of
paper
in
the
hands
of
the
government
as
a
transferor,
he
would
be
immediately
a
suspect.
if
he
saw
to
it
that
the
transferee
procured
such
a
piece
of
paper,
he
would
be
seeing
to
his
own
incrimination
in
the
eyes
of
the
government.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
if
there
had
been
an
order
form,
the
incriminatory
act
would
have
been
completed.
as
soon
as
he
received
the
order
form
or
learned
of
its
existence
and
then
transferred
marihuana
pursuant
to
it.
there
was
no
order
form
in
the
leary
case
either
and
there
were
no
registration
forms
in
the
marchetti,
grosso,
and
haynes
cases.
the
point
is
that
filling
out
the
order
form
or
acting
pursuant
to
the
order
form
in
this
case
is
in
itself
the
incriminatory
act.
in
leary,
the
incrimination
that
the
dangerous
incrimination
was
at
the
hands
of
the
state,
not
at
the
hand
of
the
federal
government
and
the
information
came
to
the
state
authorities,
not
from
leary
himself
but
from
the
federal
government.
leary
provided
the
information
only
to
the
federal
government
who
then
provided
it
to
other
people
who
would
incriminate,
who
would
indict
and
convict
leary,
this
was
dealt
to
be
too
dangerous.
i
would
like
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
narcotic
drug
act
and
the
marihuana
act.
under
the
marihuana
act,
there
are
virtually
no
legitimate
users
of
marihuana.
there
were
in
the
last
published
reports
80
registered
people,
people
who
could
deal
legitimately
with
marihuana.
i'm
informed
by
counsel
for
the
government
that
that
number
is
now
approximately
160,
but
it
compares
insignificantly
to
the
approximately
200,000
registered
people
involved
in
the
narcotic
drug
trade,
this
is
an
illegal
activity
and
this
is
a
set
of
statutes
intended
to
cause
people
to
expose
themselves
as
being
dealers
in
illegal
activities.
i'll
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
may
it
please
the
court.
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
i
believe
that
acceptance
of
the
order
form
does
more
than
acknowledge
the
man's
name,
that
acknowledges
the
fact
that
he
has
transferred
a
stated
quantity
of
marihuana
and
if
he
is
an
illegal
transferor
as
was
the
petitioner
here
and
is
--
as
would
be
virtually
anyone
prosecuted
under
this
act,
he
would
be
acknowledging
that
he
has
broken
the
law.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
he
must
acknowledge
it
to
any
person
who
comes
to
inquire
of
any
official
who
comes
to
inquire
about
this
matter.
i
believe
that
he
acknowledges
it
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
right
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
right,
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
he
has
put
himself
in
the
position
of
being
required
to
acknowledge
it
to
the
various
state
officials
who
come
around
as
a
result
of
that
order
form.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
i
believe
that
it
is
the
obligation
to
which
this
statute
looks,
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
buyer's
name
on
the
order
form
is
to
deal
with
the
second
purpose
stated
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
act,
that
is
to
expose
all
details
of
marihuana
transactions
to
the
scrutiny
both
of
the
federal
and
state
officers.
if
this
--
if
the
purpose
of
this
transfer
of
provision
was
only
to
prevent
transfers
to
unlawful
people,
the
buyer's
name
would
be
irrelevant.
the
purpose
is
to
expose
the
existence
of
the
seller
as
well
as
the
buyer
to
all
scrutiny
which
may
follow
the
coming
into
existence
of
the
order
form.
i
believe
that
there
cannot
be
any
segregation
of
this
statute
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
to
any
official
of
the
state,
local,
or
federal
official
who
comes
around,
he
must
produce
his
copy
the
order
form.
it
would
be
a
frivolous
i
think
for
him
to
say
something
like
at
that
point
he
need
not
expose
it,
there
would
be
no
purpose
in
his
having
to
take
it
in
the
first
place
if
he
didn't
have
to
display
it
when
the
officials
come
around
since
this
serves
more
than
the
valid
--
possibly
valid
purpose
of
seeing
to
it
that
these
drugs
go
only
to
a
legitimate
purchaser.
they
see
to
it
that
the
seller
is
also
exposed
to
official
scrutiny
and
that
--
that
is
done
by
seeing
to
it
that
he
maintains
a
copy
which
he
reveals
to
appropriate
--
mr.
david
a.
diamond
that's
correct.
we
feel
that's
an
integrated,
that's
fruition
of
the
entire
buyer
--
the
entire
seller
information
of
the
transfer
order
provisions
of
the
marihuana
act.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
i
think
that
that
would
be
rendering
the
entire
transfer
provisions
pointless.
there
is
no
point
to
him
taking
the
order
form
at
all
since
the
buyer
part
of
it
is
already
taken
care
of
by
the
buyer's
name
if
the
seller's
point
is
to
have
any
purpose,
it
is
to
expose
and
reveal
the
seller
if
the
seller
were
to
decline
to
disclose
the
order
form
and
he
were
sustained
on
that,
there
would
be
no
point
in
making
him
take
the
order
form
in
the
first
place.
mr.
david
a.
diamond
they
perhaps
do
but
they
may
not
make
the
man
himself,
the
man
incriminate
himself
in
relation
to
that
legitimate
interest.
they
require
him
to
register
and
maintain
records
of
the
different
sort
and
under
different
provisions
under
this
law
and
those
provisions
are
perhaps
valid
but
they
cannot
then
require
that
he
in
effect
commit
another
crime
by
refusing
to
reveal
that
he
has
violated
the
first
position,
the
first
provisions.
we
feel
this
case
comes
directly
under
the
alberts
and
marchetti
very
line.
in
addition,
the
order
form
are
all
used
as
evidence.
the
statute
describes
it
as
such.
thank
you
your
honor.
