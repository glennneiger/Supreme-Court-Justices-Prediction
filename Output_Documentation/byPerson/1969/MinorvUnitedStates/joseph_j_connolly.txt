mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
light
of
the
preceding
discussion
that
the
principles
applicable
here
and
in
minor,
my
brief
submission
will
focus
on
the
government's
view
of
the
statute
in
this
case
and
our
response
to
the
central
features
of
petitioner's
argument.
the
petitioner
contends
that
section
4742
(a)
which
simply
requires
that
he
receive
from
his
transferee
an
order
form
which
to
the
transferee
shall
have
obtained,
in
some
way
compels
him
to
make
incriminating
disclosures
to
the
government.
we
believe
that
his
contention
seeks
to
establish
much
more
than
the
words
of
the
statute
where
its
operation
in
fact
can
support.
the
offense
--
the
offense
defined
by
section
4742
(a)
does
not
make
criminal,
petitioners
failure
to
report
any
previous
misconduct
to
the
government
and
orders
the
order
form
provision
require
him
to
make
incriminating
disclosures
to
the
government
in
order
to
legalize
his
subsequent
conduct.
the
transferor
is
neither
required
nor
entitled
to
apply
for
an
order
form
from
the
district
director.
the
only
duty
which
this
statute
imposes
on
the
petitioner
is
to
transfer
marihuana
only
to
those
persons
who
have
made
their
acquisition
lawful
by
paying
the
tax
and
acquire
and
receiving
an
order
form.
the
statute
punishes
not
a
failure
to
disclose
information
but
a
transfer,
a
transfer
to
someone
who
does
not
demonstrate
that
he
has
complied
with
federal
law.
it
is
our
position
that
the
statute
on
its
face
and
in
practice
can
be
complied
with
without
the
transferors
disclosing
any
information
at
all.
petitioner's
argument
to
the
contrary
is
found
in
what
he
asserts
to
be
the
practical
consequences
of
the
statute.
he
knows
that
the
transferee
must
provide
the
name
and
address
of
the
transferor
in
his
application
for
an
order
form.
he
then
assumes
that
the
transferee
can
obtain
that
information
only
from
the
transferor
himself.
this
assumption
is
essential
to
the
success
of
petitioners
argument
for
it
provides
the
aspect
of
self-incrimination
which
is
lacking
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
unless
it
can
be
said
that
the
transferee
necessarily
must
obtain
that
information
from
the
transferor.
it
cannot
be
said
that
compliance
with
the
statute
infringes
the
transferor's
right
to
refrain
from
making
incriminating
disclosures.
the
petitioner
offers
no
support
for
this
assumption
in
which
his
argument
rests.
if
he
is
relying
on
common
experience
to
justify
the
assumption,
such
experience
in
our
view
refutes
the
assumption
as
evidence
by
the
many
cases
like
this
one,
in
which
a
purchaser
who
may
previously
be
unknown
to
a
seller
of
marihuana
is
introduced
to
him
by
a
friendly
intermediary
who
can
supply
the
name
of
the
transferor.
we
also
think
it
is
appropriate
to
point
out
that
this
case
seems
to
be
a
most
unlikely
vehicle
to
establish
as
a
constitutional
principle.
the
doctrine
that
a
transferee
of
marihuana
can
learn
the
name
and
address
of
his
seller
only
from
the
seller
himself.
the
facts
in
this
case
show
that
some
10
days
before
the
transaction
on
which
he
was
convicted,
petitioner
sold
a
quantity
of
marihuana
to
narcotics
agents
in
the
kitchen
of
his
apartment.
petitioner
would
have
the
court
conclude
that
there
was
no
way
except
from
the
petitioner
himself
that
the
agents
could
have
learned
his
name
prior
to
the
second
transaction,
who
we
think
it
needs
no
argument,
the
persons
who
sell
marihuana
in
the
kitchens
of
their
homes
are
poorly
situated
to
conceal
their
names
and
addresses.
by
basing
his
argument
on
assumptions
as
to
the
practical
effect
of
the
statute,
the
petitioner
emphasizes
the
critical
difference
between
this
case
and
leary
and
it's
antecedes.
in
each
of
those
cases,
the
statute
on
its
face
imposed
on
the
petitioner
himself
an
obligation
to
supply
certain
information.
it
was
only
one
way
the
petitioner
in
those
cases
could
comply
with
the
statute
by
supplying
the
information
himself.
in
the
present
case,
it
is
clear
that
the
transferor
can
comply
fully
and
literally
with
a
statute
where
he
receives
and
order
form
for
which
he
gave
no
information
at
all.
in
his
oral
argument,
the
petitioner
makes
the
additional
contention
that
even
if
he
did
not
supply
any
information
to
the
transferee
to
enable
the
transferee
to
obtain
the
form.
that
the
mere
fact
that
he
receives
an
order
form
thus
obtained
by
the
transferee
is
an
incriminatory
act
that
is
i
think
the
language
that
he
uses,
that
he
adopts
the
language
on
the
form.
we
submit
in
response
to
that
contention
that
there
is
no
incrimination,
there
is
no
disclosure
upon
receive
of
the
form
at
all.
the
petitioners
intended
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
inquired
of
lawyers
more
knowledgeable
with
the
operation
of
the
statute
considering
that
question,
and
the
answer
is
not
entirely
clear.
if
you
look
at
section
4742
(d)
in
the
statute,
the
third
sentence
says
the
original
shall
in
turn
be
given
by
the
transferee
to
any
person
who
shall
in
pursuance
thereof
transfer
marihuana
to
him.
thus,
the
statute
on
its
phase
does
not
prohibit
a
transferor
from
making
a
transfer
pursuant
to
a
form
in
which
his
own
name
is
not
listed
as
the
transferor
and
we
--
as
far
as
i
know
and
i
ask
there
has
never
been
any
prosecution
brought
asserting
that
--
that
that's
a
violation
of
the
order
form
requirement.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
right,
if
in
the
real
world,
in
the
lawful
world
of
marihuana
ordered
forms,
it's
unlikely
that
a
transferee
applying
for
a
lawful
order
form
will
change
his
mind
and
submit
it
to
some
other
supplier
of
marihuana,
so
we
don't
often
see
that
but
i
think
that
the
government
can
confidently
assert
the
statute
on
its
face
would
not
preclude
a
transferor
from
transferring
if
the
order
form
did
not
--
was
not
addressed
directly
to
him.
this
i
take
it
would
exclude
the
situation
in
which
the
transferor
was
a
prior
party
to
a
misstatement
on
the
application
for
an
order
form,
but
it
think
that's
far
field
of
what
you
were
asking.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
right.
the
district
director
puts
the
name
on
the
form
and
he
learns
the
name
because
it
appears
on
the
transferee's
application.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
it's
doubtful
whether
he
can
be
prosecuted
under
this
section.
the
statute
appears
to
contemplate
that
a
transferor
may
make
a
lawful
transfer
on
the
basis
of
an
ordered
form
not
addressed
to
him.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
but
that's
the
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
it's
not
clear
on
either
side.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
i
don't
believe
it
does,
not
to
a
--
not
to
his
transferee
in
all
events.
he
makes
no
disclosure
to
the
government
incident
to
accepting
form
which
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes,
he
admits
it
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
it
does
not
violate
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
he's
not
making
a
compelled,
he's
not
compelled
to
disclose
information
to
the
government
at
that
point.
he
gives
--
if
he
want
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
if
that
he
can
comply
with
4742
by
doing
no
more
than
receiving
a
form
on
which
the
transferee
has
secured,
has
instructed
the
secretary
to
put
john
smith's
name
on
it.
so
to
--
would
there
be
a
violation
to
the
fifth
amendment
if
mr.
straus
came
up
to
me
and
said,
i
hear
that
i
can
purchase
marihuana
from
joe
connor,
are
you
joe
conner
and
i
say
yes.
i
haven't
--
i
can't
see
whether
there's
any
compelled
self-incrimination
in
that
case.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
oh,
is
there
anything
in
your
question
which
suggests
that
the
transferor
upon
being
presented
with
that
form
may
feel
himself
compelled
to
make
a
transfer
of
marihuana?
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i'll
be
willing
to
interpret
the
transaction.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no
it
does
not
because
there
is
no
compulsion
to
disclose
his
name
to
the
government,
incident
to
that
transaction.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
in
our
view
of
the
practical
consequences
of
the
illicit
viewings
in
marihuana
in
any
case
in
which
an
order
form
maybe
tender
to
an
illicit
transferor
like
petitioner,
the
most
reasonable
assumption
contrary
to
petitioner's
assumption
is
that
none
of
the
information
was
supplied
for
that
purpose
by
the
transferor.
it
is
to
be
sure
difficult
to
assess
assumptions
in
either
side
of
the
case
in
this
area
because
it
is
so
very
unlikely
that
an
illicit
transferor
will
ever
be
presented
with
an
order
form.
the
160
registered
handlers
of
marihuana
have
no
reason
as
far
as
we
know
to
acquire
marihuana
on
the
illicit
market.
the
far
more
numerous
on
registered
consumers
are
hardly
likely
to
secure
order
forms,
the
cost
of
incriminating
themselves
and
paying
a
$100.00
tax,
when
their
failure
to
pay
the
tax
and
to
acquire
marihuana
pursuant
to
an
order
form
is
not
punishable
under
leary.
so
it's
quite
easy
to
say
that
whether
--
suppose
there
is
a
transferor
--
transferee
who
wants
to
acquire
marihuana
from
an
illicit
seller
and
who
is
willing
to
acquire
an
order
form
for
that
purpose,
then
it's
very
difficult
to
translate
that
supposition
into
a
factual
hypothetical
which
makes
sense
in
the
real
world.
even
if
we're
willing
to
accept
that
supposition
however
and
to
accept
the
further
doubtful
premise
that
a
transferee
of
marihuana
could
acquire
an
order
form,
that
is
whether
the
district
director
lawfully
could
issue
an
order
form
addressed
to
an
illicit
transferor.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes,
it
is
a
tax.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
it's
a
tax
from
the
transfer
of
marihuana.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
one
ounce,
it's
a
prohibitive
tax.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes,
it
is.
that
is
under
leary,
a
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
leary
interpreted
the
statute
is
contemplating,
that
anyone
could
pay
the
tax
and
get
an
order
form.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
right.
and
on
that
basis,
we
suggest
in
our
brief
that
there
is
a
serious
question
whether
the
district
director
will
or
could
issue
an
order
form
to
peter
straus
to
acquire
marihuana
from
joseph
connolly.
when
joseph
connolly's
transfer
will
be
unlawful
under
another
provision
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
believe
--
i
believe
that
that
inquiry
is
made
but
there
are
--
there
is
not
a
great
volume
of
marihuana
order
form
in
the
state,
it
might
be
a
very
difficult
thing
to
do
with
under
the
narcotic
statute
would
it
be
400,000.
but
under
the
marihuana
law,
some
checking's
may.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that
is
done.
if
it
is
as
far
--
the
question
whether,
what's
the
district
director
is
to
do
in
a
situation
which
he
finds
that
the
proposed
seller
is
not
registered
apparently
hasn't
come
up
because
there
hasn't
been
an
application
for
an
order
form
to
acquire
marihuana
from
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
present
thinking
is
that
it
does
not
have
medicinal
uses
but
there's
still
a
great
deal
of
experimentation
being
conducted
in
it,
about
a
140
of
the
160
registrants
are
doctors
in
private
practice
and
doctors
in
research
facilities
who
are
seeking
to
determine
conclusively
whether
it
does
have.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
they
might
not
be
sellers
except
among
research
institutions,
they
might
be
transferors
and
it's
broad
to
say
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
the
statute
which
prohibits
unregistered
trafficking
in
marihuana
has
the
list
of
various
activities
dealing
and
selling,
administering
and
giving
away.
section
4742
which
deals
and
section
4741
which
imposes
the
tax
speaks
of
a
transfer
which
that
statute
defines
as
any
exchange
of
possession
except
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
right.
that
is
a
transfer
under
the
statute
exempted
fro
the
order
form
and
tax
and
the
transfer
tax
requirements.
to
continue
on
with
the
question
whether
the
transferor
is
likely
to
supply
any
information
to
the
transferee
in
order
to
enable
the
transferee
to
get
an
order
form,
we
think
that
any
assumption
along
those
lines
contradicts
the
transfer,
the
seller's
basic
instinct
to
avoid
having
this
transaction
come
to
the
attention
of
the
government
at
all.
it's
virtually
impossible
for
us
to
have
conceived
of
the
situation
in
which
the
transferor
would
cooperate
with
the
transferee
who
would
express
an
intention
to
get
an
order
form.
we
would
not
expect
mr.
diamond
to
deny
that
for
an
illicit
transferor
and
petitioner's
possession
in
order
for
him
is
just
about
the
last
thing
that
he
wants.
and
if
the
transferee
does
produce
an
order
form
which
he
can
might
have
obtained
without
the
knowledge
of
the
transferor,
we
believe
that
the
transferor
undoubtedly
would
refuse
to
complete
the
transaction
pursuant
to
that
form
because
it
would
be
subject
to
intense
scrutiny.
if
that
is
true,
then
we
see
no
reason
to
believe
that
an
illicit
transferor
would
as
a
means
of
complying
with
the
statute
provide
any
information
to
his
transferee
but
in
short,
we
conclude
that
this
statute
does
not
impose
upon
the
transferor
of
marihuana
any
duty
to
make
an
incriminating
disclosure
which
is
then
transmitted
to
the
government.
i
think
that's
the
significant
difference
between
this
case
in
leary
that
whatever
characterization
you
might
want
to
give
to
the
transferor's
consummating
the
transaction
pursuant
to
this
document,
that
act
involves
no
matter
of
communicated
by
him
or
by
the
transferee
to
the
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no.
it
would
--
no,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
well,
--
that's
one
choice
which
we
would
--
we'd
like
to
preserve
whatever
is
left
of
that
argument.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
but
the
more
important
matter
is
that
it's
not
communicated.
that
he
may
comply
with
the
statute,
he
may
have
full
and
literal
compliance
with
this
statute
without
any
communication.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
don't
the
--
that's
a
bit
harder
case
because
you
give
it
about
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
--
my
position
stands.
i
don't
think
that
involves
the
fifth
amendment
violation,
regarding
the
more
you
get
me
involve
in
communication
directly
to
the
buyer
then
i'm
worried
about
the
next
step
but
i
don't
believe
that
there's
any
fifth
amendment
violation
because
in
that
situation
i
can't
see
any
communication,
i
can't
see
any
communication
in
this
case.
what
incriminates
the
transferor
in
this
case
is
not
anything
that
he
says
but
what
he
does
by
selling
marihuana,
that's
what
subjects
him
to
possible
prosecution
under
the
law
and
it's
not
on
the
basis
of
any
disclosure
which
is
made
incident
to
this
transaction.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that
is
the
only
statutory
obligation.
you
point
out
that
there
is
difference
between
what
the
regulations
contemplate
under
the
narcotics
laws
and
what
the
statute
contemplates
here
and
for
the
reasons
which
we
set
forth
in
our
brief.
we
believe
that
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes
sir.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
light
of
the
preceding
discussion
that
the
principles
applicable
here
and
in
minor,
my
brief
submission
will
focus
on
the
government's
view
of
the
statute
in
this
case
and
our
response
to
the
central
features
of
petitioner's
argument.
the
petitioner
contends
that
section
4742
(a)
which
simply
requires
that
he
receive
from
his
transferee
an
order
form
which
to
the
transferee
shall
have
obtained,
in
some
way
compels
him
to
make
incriminating
disclosures
to
the
government.
we
believe
that
his
contention
seeks
to
establish
much
more
than
the
words
of
the
statute
where
its
operation
in
fact
can
support.
the
offense
--
the
offense
defined
by
section
4742
(a)
does
not
make
criminal,
petitioners
failure
to
report
any
previous
misconduct
to
the
government
and
orders
the
order
form
provision
require
him
to
make
incriminating
disclosures
to
the
government
in
order
to
legalize
his
subsequent
conduct.
the
transferor
is
neither
required
nor
entitled
to
apply
for
an
order
form
from
the
district
director.
the
only
duty
which
this
statute
imposes
on
the
petitioner
is
to
transfer
marihuana
only
to
those
persons
who
have
made
their
acquisition
lawful
by
paying
the
tax
and
acquire
and
receiving
an
order
form.
the
statute
punishes
not
a
failure
to
disclose
information
but
a
transfer,
a
transfer
to
someone
who
does
not
demonstrate
that
he
has
complied
with
federal
law.
it
is
our
position
that
the
statute
on
its
face
and
in
practice
can
be
complied
with
without
the
transferors
disclosing
any
information
at
all.
petitioner's
argument
to
the
contrary
is
found
in
what
he
asserts
to
be
the
practical
consequences
of
the
statute.
he
knows
that
the
transferee
must
provide
the
name
and
address
of
the
transferor
in
his
application
for
an
order
form.
he
then
assumes
that
the
transferee
can
obtain
that
information
only
from
the
transferor
himself.
this
assumption
is
essential
to
the
success
of
petitioners
argument
for
it
provides
the
aspect
of
self-incrimination
which
is
lacking
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
unless
it
can
be
said
that
the
transferee
necessarily
must
obtain
that
information
from
the
transferor.
it
cannot
be
said
that
compliance
with
the
statute
infringes
the
transferor's
right
to
refrain
from
making
incriminating
disclosures.
the
petitioner
offers
no
support
for
this
assumption
in
which
his
argument
rests.
if
he
is
relying
on
common
experience
to
justify
the
assumption,
such
experience
in
our
view
refutes
the
assumption
as
evidence
by
the
many
cases
like
this
one,
in
which
a
purchaser
who
may
previously
be
unknown
to
a
seller
of
marihuana
is
introduced
to
him
by
a
friendly
intermediary
who
can
supply
the
name
of
the
transferor.
we
also
think
it
is
appropriate
to
point
out
that
this
case
seems
to
be
a
most
unlikely
vehicle
to
establish
as
a
constitutional
principle.
the
doctrine
that
a
transferee
of
marihuana
can
learn
the
name
and
address
of
his
seller
only
from
the
seller
himself.
the
facts
in
this
case
show
that
some
10
days
before
the
transaction
on
which
he
was
convicted,
petitioner
sold
a
quantity
of
marihuana
to
narcotics
agents
in
the
kitchen
of
his
apartment.
petitioner
would
have
the
court
conclude
that
there
was
no
way
except
from
the
petitioner
himself
that
the
agents
could
have
learned
his
name
prior
to
the
second
transaction,
who
we
think
it
needs
no
argument,
the
persons
who
sell
marihuana
in
the
kitchens
of
their
homes
are
poorly
situated
to
conceal
their
names
and
addresses.
by
basing
his
argument
on
assumptions
as
to
the
practical
effect
of
the
statute,
the
petitioner
emphasizes
the
critical
difference
between
this
case
and
leary
and
it's
antecedes.
in
each
of
those
cases,
the
statute
on
its
face
imposed
on
the
petitioner
himself
an
obligation
to
supply
certain
information.
it
was
only
one
way
the
petitioner
in
those
cases
could
comply
with
the
statute
by
supplying
the
information
himself.
in
the
present
case,
it
is
clear
that
the
transferor
can
comply
fully
and
literally
with
a
statute
where
he
receives
and
order
form
for
which
he
gave
no
information
at
all.
in
his
oral
argument,
the
petitioner
makes
the
additional
contention
that
even
if
he
did
not
supply
any
information
to
the
transferee
to
enable
the
transferee
to
obtain
the
form.
that
the
mere
fact
that
he
receives
an
order
form
thus
obtained
by
the
transferee
is
an
incriminatory
act
that
is
i
think
the
language
that
he
uses,
that
he
adopts
the
language
on
the
form.
we
submit
in
response
to
that
contention
that
there
is
no
incrimination,
there
is
no
disclosure
upon
receive
of
the
form
at
all.
the
petitioners
intended
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
inquired
of
lawyers
more
knowledgeable
with
the
operation
of
the
statute
considering
that
question,
and
the
answer
is
not
entirely
clear.
if
you
look
at
section
4742
(d)
in
the
statute,
the
third
sentence
says
the
original
shall
in
turn
be
given
by
the
transferee
to
any
person
who
shall
in
pursuance
thereof
transfer
marihuana
to
him.
thus,
the
statute
on
its
phase
does
not
prohibit
a
transferor
from
making
a
transfer
pursuant
to
a
form
in
which
his
own
name
is
not
listed
as
the
transferor
and
we
--
as
far
as
i
know
and
i
ask
there
has
never
been
any
prosecution
brought
asserting
that
--
that
that's
a
violation
of
the
order
form
requirement.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
right,
if
in
the
real
world,
in
the
lawful
world
of
marihuana
ordered
forms,
it's
unlikely
that
a
transferee
applying
for
a
lawful
order
form
will
change
his
mind
and
submit
it
to
some
other
supplier
of
marihuana,
so
we
don't
often
see
that
but
i
think
that
the
government
can
confidently
assert
the
statute
on
its
face
would
not
preclude
a
transferor
from
transferring
if
the
order
form
did
not
--
was
not
addressed
directly
to
him.
this
i
take
it
would
exclude
the
situation
in
which
the
transferor
was
a
prior
party
to
a
misstatement
on
the
application
for
an
order
form,
but
it
think
that's
far
field
of
what
you
were
asking.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
right.
the
district
director
puts
the
name
on
the
form
and
he
learns
the
name
because
it
appears
on
the
transferee's
application.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
it's
doubtful
whether
he
can
be
prosecuted
under
this
section.
the
statute
appears
to
contemplate
that
a
transferor
may
make
a
lawful
transfer
on
the
basis
of
an
ordered
form
not
addressed
to
him.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
but
that's
the
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
it's
not
clear
on
either
side.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
i
don't
believe
it
does,
not
to
a
--
not
to
his
transferee
in
all
events.
he
makes
no
disclosure
to
the
government
incident
to
accepting
form
which
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes,
he
admits
it
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
it
does
not
violate
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
he's
not
making
a
compelled,
he's
not
compelled
to
disclose
information
to
the
government
at
that
point.
he
gives
--
if
he
want
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
if
that
he
can
comply
with
4742
by
doing
no
more
than
receiving
a
form
on
which
the
transferee
has
secured,
has
instructed
the
secretary
to
put
john
smith's
name
on
it.
so
to
--
would
there
be
a
violation
to
the
fifth
amendment
if
mr.
straus
came
up
to
me
and
said,
i
hear
that
i
can
purchase
marihuana
from
joe
connor,
are
you
joe
conner
and
i
say
yes.
i
haven't
--
i
can't
see
whether
there's
any
compelled
self-incrimination
in
that
case.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
oh,
is
there
anything
in
your
question
which
suggests
that
the
transferor
upon
being
presented
with
that
form
may
feel
himself
compelled
to
make
a
transfer
of
marihuana?
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i'll
be
willing
to
interpret
the
transaction.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no
it
does
not
because
there
is
no
compulsion
to
disclose
his
name
to
the
government,
incident
to
that
transaction.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
in
our
view
of
the
practical
consequences
of
the
illicit
viewings
in
marihuana
in
any
case
in
which
an
order
form
maybe
tender
to
an
illicit
transferor
like
petitioner,
the
most
reasonable
assumption
contrary
to
petitioner's
assumption
is
that
none
of
the
information
was
supplied
for
that
purpose
by
the
transferor.
it
is
to
be
sure
difficult
to
assess
assumptions
in
either
side
of
the
case
in
this
area
because
it
is
so
very
unlikely
that
an
illicit
transferor
will
ever
be
presented
with
an
order
form.
the
160
registered
handlers
of
marihuana
have
no
reason
as
far
as
we
know
to
acquire
marihuana
on
the
illicit
market.
the
far
more
numerous
on
registered
consumers
are
hardly
likely
to
secure
order
forms,
the
cost
of
incriminating
themselves
and
paying
a
$100.00
tax,
when
their
failure
to
pay
the
tax
and
to
acquire
marihuana
pursuant
to
an
order
form
is
not
punishable
under
leary.
so
it's
quite
easy
to
say
that
whether
--
suppose
there
is
a
transferor
--
transferee
who
wants
to
acquire
marihuana
from
an
illicit
seller
and
who
is
willing
to
acquire
an
order
form
for
that
purpose,
then
it's
very
difficult
to
translate
that
supposition
into
a
factual
hypothetical
which
makes
sense
in
the
real
world.
even
if
we're
willing
to
accept
that
supposition
however
and
to
accept
the
further
doubtful
premise
that
a
transferee
of
marihuana
could
acquire
an
order
form,
that
is
whether
the
district
director
lawfully
could
issue
an
order
form
addressed
to
an
illicit
transferor.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes,
it
is
a
tax.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
it's
a
tax
from
the
transfer
of
marihuana.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
one
ounce,
it's
a
prohibitive
tax.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes,
it
is.
that
is
under
leary,
a
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
leary
interpreted
the
statute
is
contemplating,
that
anyone
could
pay
the
tax
and
get
an
order
form.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
right.
and
on
that
basis,
we
suggest
in
our
brief
that
there
is
a
serious
question
whether
the
district
director
will
or
could
issue
an
order
form
to
peter
straus
to
acquire
marihuana
from
joseph
connolly.
when
joseph
connolly's
transfer
will
be
unlawful
under
another
provision
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
believe
--
i
believe
that
that
inquiry
is
made
but
there
are
--
there
is
not
a
great
volume
of
marihuana
order
form
in
the
state,
it
might
be
a
very
difficult
thing
to
do
with
under
the
narcotic
statute
would
it
be
400,000.
but
under
the
marihuana
law,
some
checking's
may.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that
is
done.
if
it
is
as
far
--
the
question
whether,
what's
the
district
director
is
to
do
in
a
situation
which
he
finds
that
the
proposed
seller
is
not
registered
apparently
hasn't
come
up
because
there
hasn't
been
an
application
for
an
order
form
to
acquire
marihuana
from
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
present
thinking
is
that
it
does
not
have
medicinal
uses
but
there's
still
a
great
deal
of
experimentation
being
conducted
in
it,
about
a
140
of
the
160
registrants
are
doctors
in
private
practice
and
doctors
in
research
facilities
who
are
seeking
to
determine
conclusively
whether
it
does
have.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
they
might
not
be
sellers
except
among
research
institutions,
they
might
be
transferors
and
it's
broad
to
say
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
the
statute
which
prohibits
unregistered
trafficking
in
marihuana
has
the
list
of
various
activities
dealing
and
selling,
administering
and
giving
away.
section
4742
which
deals
and
section
4741
which
imposes
the
tax
speaks
of
a
transfer
which
that
statute
defines
as
any
exchange
of
possession
except
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
right.
that
is
a
transfer
under
the
statute
exempted
fro
the
order
form
and
tax
and
the
transfer
tax
requirements.
to
continue
on
with
the
question
whether
the
transferor
is
likely
to
supply
any
information
to
the
transferee
in
order
to
enable
the
transferee
to
get
an
order
form,
we
think
that
any
assumption
along
those
lines
contradicts
the
transfer,
the
seller's
basic
instinct
to
avoid
having
this
transaction
come
to
the
attention
of
the
government
at
all.
it's
virtually
impossible
for
us
to
have
conceived
of
the
situation
in
which
the
transferor
would
cooperate
with
the
transferee
who
would
express
an
intention
to
get
an
order
form.
we
would
not
expect
mr.
diamond
to
deny
that
for
an
illicit
transferor
and
petitioner's
possession
in
order
for
him
is
just
about
the
last
thing
that
he
wants.
and
if
the
transferee
does
produce
an
order
form
which
he
can
might
have
obtained
without
the
knowledge
of
the
transferor,
we
believe
that
the
transferor
undoubtedly
would
refuse
to
complete
the
transaction
pursuant
to
that
form
because
it
would
be
subject
to
intense
scrutiny.
if
that
is
true,
then
we
see
no
reason
to
believe
that
an
illicit
transferor
would
as
a
means
of
complying
with
the
statute
provide
any
information
to
his
transferee
but
in
short,
we
conclude
that
this
statute
does
not
impose
upon
the
transferor
of
marihuana
any
duty
to
make
an
incriminating
disclosure
which
is
then
transmitted
to
the
government.
i
think
that's
the
significant
difference
between
this
case
in
leary
that
whatever
characterization
you
might
want
to
give
to
the
transferor's
consummating
the
transaction
pursuant
to
this
document,
that
act
involves
no
matter
of
communicated
by
him
or
by
the
transferee
to
the
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no.
it
would
--
no,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
well,
--
that's
one
choice
which
we
would
--
we'd
like
to
preserve
whatever
is
left
of
that
argument.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
but
the
more
important
matter
is
that
it's
not
communicated.
that
he
may
comply
with
the
statute,
he
may
have
full
and
literal
compliance
with
this
statute
without
any
communication.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
don't
the
--
that's
a
bit
harder
case
because
you
give
it
about
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
--
my
position
stands.
i
don't
think
that
involves
the
fifth
amendment
violation,
regarding
the
more
you
get
me
involve
in
communication
directly
to
the
buyer
then
i'm
worried
about
the
next
step
but
i
don't
believe
that
there's
any
fifth
amendment
violation
because
in
that
situation
i
can't
see
any
communication,
i
can't
see
any
communication
in
this
case.
what
incriminates
the
transferor
in
this
case
is
not
anything
that
he
says
but
what
he
does
by
selling
marihuana,
that's
what
subjects
him
to
possible
prosecution
under
the
law
and
it's
not
on
the
basis
of
any
disclosure
which
is
made
incident
to
this
transaction.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that
is
the
only
statutory
obligation.
you
point
out
that
there
is
difference
between
what
the
regulations
contemplate
under
the
narcotics
laws
and
what
the
statute
contemplates
here
and
for
the
reasons
which
we
set
forth
in
our
brief.
we
believe
that
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes
sir.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
