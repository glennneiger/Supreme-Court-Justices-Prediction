justice
potter
stewart
where
--
the
order
form
is
here
in
your
appendix
c
to
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
purchaser
fills
out
presumably
his
name
and
all
that
information
says
to
be
filled
in
by
purchaser,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
the
vendor
must
fill
in
what,
presumably?
justice
potter
stewart
to
be
filled
in
by
the
consignor.
justice
potter
stewart
he
fills
in
a
number
of
packages
furnished
and
the
date
filled,
it
says?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
does
that
show
the
amount,
because
it
doesn’t
say
packages
on
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
by
catalogue
number
over
there
in
the
left?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
who
signs
it
down
there?
name
of
person
or
firm?
justice
potter
stewart
if
not
an
individual.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
addressed
to
by
the
purchaser,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
preposition
“to”
is
that
means
it’s
directed
to
and
this
doesn’t
mean
it’s
objective
not
subjective
--
justice
potter
stewart
come
to
think
of
that
reasoning
would
apply
to
this
case,
only
if
there
were
federal
statute
that
required
some
seller
who
sold
somebody
narcotics
without
receiving
an
order
form
to
report
that
fact.
that’s
the
missing
link
in
this
case,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what’s
that
one?
justice
potter
stewart
that
criminal
sanction
behind
it
if
there
is
a
sale
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
a
presentation
of
an
order
form,
then
there’s
an
obligation
upon
the
seller
to
keep
one
copy
of
the
form
for
a
period
time,
and
to
send
another
one
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
is
that
does
enforceable
through
a
criminal
sanction?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
i
quite
misunderstood
the
situation
and
factually.
i
thought
that
there
was
absolutely
no
legal
traffic
in
heroin
whatsoever
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
we’re
talking
about
heroin
in
this
case,
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
take
the
outlaw,
illegal
dealings
and
whatever
in
the
united
states
of
america,
that’s
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
for
experimental
purposes
(voice
overlap)
registration.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
who
fills
in,
on
the
form,
who
fills
in
the
items
thereby
number,
catalogue
number,
and
so
on?
justice
potter
stewart
the
applicant?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
i’m
talking
about
the
left
hand.
justice
potter
stewart
consignor
is
the
vendor,
the
seller.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
you
perhaps
didn’t
have
the
opportunity
to
fully
answer
my
question.
when
the
applicant
sends
this
in,
as
i
understood
it,
you
said
that
the
applicant
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes
--
no,
no.
when
the
applicant
sends
in
and
applies
for
an
order
form
to
the
treasury
department.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
this
is
what
he
gets
back?
justice
potter
stewart
application
form.
justice
potter
stewart
and
now,
does
he
indicate
on
that
what
the
drugs
he
wants
to
purchase?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
there
were
an
order
form
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
law
and
the
part
of
the
purchaser.
justice
potter
stewart
the
form
is
appendix
b
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
as
you
point
out,
this
is
a
form
quite
different
from
the
one
in
the
last
case.
in
that,
the
sellers
name
is
not
when
it
comes
from
the
government,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
seller?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
which
precise
statute,
very
statutory
provision
on
the
one
with
the
contained
in
your
appendix,
this
man
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
convicted
of
violating
4742.
justice
potter
stewart
which
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
what
we
have
is
in
appendix
b
as
the
--
is
what
has
issued
by
the
treasury
department?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
order
to
get
that
issued
to
him,
a
prospective
transferee,
a
would
be
transferee
as
to
make
an
application
for
it
i
assume?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
the
application,
does
he
give
the
name
of
the
prospective
vendor?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
to
prevent
him
from
just
putting
george
washington
or
abraham
lincoln
or
charles
1856
in
there?
justice
potter
stewart
who
is
eligible
to
make
an
application
for
--
justice
potter
stewart
any
person?
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
does
he
get
--
does
he
give
the
name
or
any
registration
number
or
anything
else
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
the
perspective
vendor?
justice
potter
stewart
what
in
the
world
it's
preventing
from
putting
down
their
marihuana
on
richard
m.
nixon
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
edmond
musky.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so,
where
is
the
--
and
that's
not
self-incrimination,
is
it
if
he's
incriminating
anybody,
its
edmond
musky.
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
potential
perspective
possible
vendor?
justice
potter
stewart
why
is
it
required?
i
mean
why
--
the
requirement
is
there
that
you
put
down
anything
except
any
name
and
address
of
somebody?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
right,
i
don't
understand
and
that's
what
prompted
my
question
of
the
moment
ago.
what's
the
transferor
got
to
do
with
this?
justice
potter
stewart
whatever,
would
it
be
an
offense
under
4742
(a)
for
a
man
named
john
smith
to
sell
marihuana
to
somebody
pursuant
to
order
form
in
which
the
top
name
was
robert
jones?
justice
potter
stewart
highly
unlikely,
casual
situation
except
that
it
does
go
i
think
to
the
petitioner's
argument
--
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
the
statute
itself
says
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
to
transfer
marihuana
except
in
pursuance
of
a
written
order.
now,
if
that
order
is
not
directed
to
him
but
actually
is
directed
to
somebody
with
a
name
of
john
smith,
that's
not
in
pursuance
really
of
a
written
order.
giving
the
words
ordinary
meaningless
--
justice
potter
stewart
an
order
to
somebody
else
and
therefore
is
not
in
pursuance
of
a
written
order
just
as
i
say
implicitly
in
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
is
anyway
illegible
to
apply
for
order
form?
i
understood
the
answer
to
be
yes?
justice
potter
stewart
forget
about
leary,
just
talking
about
the
statute,
just
forget
about
it.
justice
potter
stewart
construe
the
statute
as
so
provide?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
then
so
person
not
need
be
registered
in
any
way
to
be
a
purchaser?
justice
potter
stewart
that
a
person
needs
to
be
registered
to
be
a
lawful
seller?
justice
potter
stewart
or
what
in
fact
happens
when
an
application
comes
in?
does
the
treasury
check
the
name
of
the
proposed
transferor
for
the
proposed
seller
to
see
if
that
is
one
of
the
160
registered
sellers
in
the
country?
justice
potter
stewart
if
there's
only
a
160
legal
sellers
of
marihuana
in
the
country
with
or
without
them
having
--
who
are
qualified
eligible
to
sell
marihuana
legally
under
any
conditions
wouldn't
be
much
of
a
trick
to
check
the
name
on
the
application
of
the
proposed
buyer,
the
name
that
he
gives
of
the
seller
against
that
list
of
a
160,
is
that
done
or
isn't
it
done?
justice
potter
stewart
for
the
counts
for
the
fact
that
there
are
as
many
as
160
lawful
sellers,
registered
sellers
of
marihuana
in
the
united
states,
does
it
have
medicinal
uses?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
can
understand
how
those
people
would
research
positions
might
be
purchasers
but
i
don't
see
why
there
could
be
sellers,
why
they
would
want
to
be
sellers.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
would
include
possession
giving
it
to
a
patient
or
a
research
center,
that
would
be
a
transfer?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
this
say
you
probably
already
covered
this
but
i
want
to
be
sure
i
get
a
distinction.
in
this
case,
it
is
not
an
obligation
of
the
transferor
to
send
in
an
copy
of
the
order
form
to
the
government,
it's
only
its
obligation
to
keep
it
on
--
keep
it
in
his
possession
subject
to
an
inspection
for
a
period
of
time.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
make
any
difference
anyway
because
that's
a
separate
regulation
statute
or
so.
but
there
is
that
difference
between
this
investigation?
justice
potter
stewart
but
to
whom
does
he
acknowledge
it?
justice
potter
stewart
when
he
gives
money,
when
he
receives
the
order
form?
justice
potter
stewart
under
your
--
under
your
submission
he
acknowledges
that
he
has
then
sold
a
quantity
of
marihuana?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he's
acknowledge
it
at
best
only
to
the
--
only
to
the
buyer
not
to
the
transferee
that
--
who
is
not
the
government?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
because
that's
of
a
separate
obligation
to
keep
the
order
form
in
his
possession
on
file?
justice
potter
stewart
where
--
the
order
form
is
here
in
your
appendix
c
to
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
purchaser
fills
out
presumably
his
name
and
all
that
information
says
to
be
filled
in
by
purchaser,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
the
vendor
must
fill
in
what,
presumably?
justice
potter
stewart
to
be
filled
in
by
the
consignor.
justice
potter
stewart
he
fills
in
a
number
of
packages
furnished
and
the
date
filled,
it
says?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
does
that
show
the
amount,
because
it
doesn’t
say
packages
on
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
by
catalogue
number
over
there
in
the
left?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
who
signs
it
down
there?
name
of
person
or
firm?
justice
potter
stewart
if
not
an
individual.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
addressed
to
by
the
purchaser,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
preposition
“to”
is
that
means
it’s
directed
to
and
this
doesn’t
mean
it’s
objective
not
subjective
--
justice
potter
stewart
come
to
think
of
that
reasoning
would
apply
to
this
case,
only
if
there
were
federal
statute
that
required
some
seller
who
sold
somebody
narcotics
without
receiving
an
order
form
to
report
that
fact.
that’s
the
missing
link
in
this
case,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what’s
that
one?
justice
potter
stewart
that
criminal
sanction
behind
it
if
there
is
a
sale
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
a
presentation
of
an
order
form,
then
there’s
an
obligation
upon
the
seller
to
keep
one
copy
of
the
form
for
a
period
time,
and
to
send
another
one
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
is
that
does
enforceable
through
a
criminal
sanction?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter

quite

justice

right.
justice

who

in,
on
the

who
fills
in
the
items
thereby
number,
catalogue
number,
and
so
on?
justice
potter
stewart
the

justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
i’m
talking
about
the
left
hand.
justice
potter
stewart

is
the

the

justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
you
perhaps
didn’t
have
the
opportunity
to
fully

my
question.
when
the

sends
this
in,
as
i
understood
it,
you
said
that
the
applicant
--
justice

stewart
yes
--
no,
no.
when
the

sends
in
and
applies
for
an

form
to
the
treasury
department.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
this
is
what
he
gets
back?
justice
potter
stewart
application
form.
justice
potter
stewart
and
now,
does
he
indicate
on
that
what
the
drugs
he
wants
to
purchase?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
there
were
an
order

it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
law
and
the
part
of
the
purchaser.
justice

stewart
the
form
is
appendix

in

justice
potter
stewart
as
you
point
out,
this
is
a
form
quite
different
from
the

in
the
last
case.
in
that,
the
sellers
name
is
not
when
it
comes
from
the

is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
seller?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
which

contained
in

when
an
application
comes
in?
does
the
treasury
check
the
name
of
the
proposed
transferor
for
the
proposed
seller
to
see
if
that
is
one
of
the
160
registered
sellers
in
the
country?
justice
potter
stewart
if
there's
only
a
160
legal
sellers
of
marihuana
in
the
country
with
or
without
them
having
--
who
are
qualified
eligible
to
sell
marihuana
legally
under
any
conditions
wouldn't
be
much
of
a
trick
to
check
the
name
on
the
application
of
the
proposed
buyer,
the
name
that
he
gives
of
the
seller
against
that
list
of
a
160,
is
that
done
or
isn't
it
done?
justice
potter
stewart
for
the
counts
for
the
fact
that
there
are
as
many
as
160
lawful
sellers,
registered
sellers
of
marihuana
in
the
united
states,
does
it
have
medicinal
uses?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
can
understand
how
those
people
would
research
positions
might
be
purchasers
but
i
don't
see
why
there
could
be
sellers,
why
they
would
want
to
be
sellers.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
would
include
possession
giving
it
to
a
patient
or
a
research
center,
that
would
be
a
transfer?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
this
say
you
probably
already
covered
this
but
i
want
to
be
sure
i
get
a
distinction.
in
this
case,
it
is
not
an
obligation
of
the
transferor
to
send
in
an
copy
of
the
order
form
to
the
government,
it's
only
its
obligation
to
keep
it
on
--
keep
it
in
his
possession
subject
to
an
inspection
for
a
period
of
time.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
make
any
difference
anyway
because
that's
a
separate
regulation
statute
or
so.
but
there
is
that
difference
between
this
investigation?
justice
potter
stewart
but
to
whom
does
he
acknowledge
it?
justice
potter
stewart
when
he
gives
money,
when
he
receives
the
order
form?
justice
potter
stewart
under
your
--
under
your
submission
he
acknowledges
that
he
has
then
sold
a
quantity
of
marihuana?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he's
acknowledge
it
at
best
only
to
the
--
only
to
the
buyer
not
to
the
transferee
that
--
who
is
not
the
government?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
because
that's
of
a
separate
obligation
to
keep
the
order
form
in
his
possession
on
file?
