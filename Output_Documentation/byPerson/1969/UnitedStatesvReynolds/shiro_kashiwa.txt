mr.
shiro
kashiwa
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
review
of
a
session
of
the
sixth
circuit
relating
to
the
scope
of
project
rule
expressed
by
this
court
in
the
miller
case
in
1943,
317
u.s.
369.
briefly,
the
factual
situation
was
first
of
all,
this
had
to
do
with
the
nolin
reservoir
project
in
kentucky.
the
reynolds
owned
a
total
of
390
acres.
the
present
case
is
a
case
of
partial
taking
of
250
acres
out
of
the
390,
in
other
words
after
the
taking
in
this
case
they
were
a
140
acres
remaining.
out
of
the
250
acres,
172
acres
were
for
inundation
and
78
acres
were
for
recreational
purposes
and
it's
the
78
acres
which
causes
the
question
in
this
case.
now,
with
relation
to
the
project,
the
project
was
congressionally
authorized
way
back
in
1958
as
a
flood
control
plan
for
the
ohio
and
mississippi
rivers.
incidentally,
after
1938,
in
1944,
congress
has
passed
the
special
statute
authorizing
acquisition
of
recreational
areas
in
conjunction
with
reservoir
projects.
in
1956,
planning
funds
were
appropriated
for
the
nolin
project
and
in
july
1958,
a
general
design
memoranda
was
approved.
this
design
memoranda,
contained
contemplated
recreational
areas
definitely.
in
september
1958,
funds
were
provided
by
congress
for
the
project
and
in
january
1959,
the
project
was
started.
in
october
1959,
this
78
acres
for
recreational
purpose
was
specifically
set
aside
in
a
memo
by
the
united
states
engineers.
in
april
18th
1962,
a
suit
was
filed
and
declaration
of
taking
filed
in
the
case.
incidentally
going
back,
the
reynolds's
purchased
this
property
in
october
of
1959,
a
portion
of
it
in
october
59
and
the
balance
of
it
in
1960,
of
course
before
the
case
was
filed.
we
have
to
go
into
the
proceedings
in
the
trial
court
to
fully
understand
the
issues.
in
the
trial
court,
the
court
held
with
relation
to
any
enhancement
testimony
as
to
the
78
acres,
this
is
a
recreation
area.
the
court
held
that
it
is
a
question
for
the
trial
court
to
decide
and
it
held
that
it
held
that
it
will
not
allow
any
enhancement
testimony,
this
is
in
the
original,
the
first
portion
of
the
trial.
but
just
before
the
case
went
to
the
jury,
the
court
changed
its
mind
and
said
no
as
to
whether
the
78
acres
was
within
the
scope
of
the
project
or
not,
it
will
allow
the
jury
to
consider
and
so
the
owners
put
on
testimony
with
relation
to
the
78
acres
with
and
without
enhancement.
the
case
went
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
in
this
case
filed
that
the
land
was
probably
within
the
scope
of
the
project
under
the
instructions
of
the
court,
if
that
was
so
then
enhancement
was
not
to
be
allowed.
therefore,
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
only
$20,000.00.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
also
following
the
trial
court
held
that
whether
it
was
in
the
scope
of
the
project
this
question
was
before
the
jury,
but
the
appellant
court
reversed
the
case
as
$20,000.00
verdict
because
the
jury
was
allowed
to
consider
facts
which
were
not
an
evidence,
it
happened
in
this
way.
the
court
at
first
took
the
scope
of
the
project
question
and
testimony
was
adduced
only
before
the
court.
but
later
when
it
changed
its
mind,
the
witnesses
testified
but
government
attorney
did
not
cover
the
testimony
as
fully
as
he
did
just
before
the
court
but
he
remembered
--
but
the
court
in
considering
the
evidence
---
commenting
on
the
evidence
went
back
to
the
evidence
he
heard
while
he
was
sitting
at
the
court
and
in
this
mix
up,
the
grounds
for
reversal
came
up,
i
will
go
back
to
this
later.
so
the
issue
--
the
first
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
scope
of
the
project
question
is
a
determination
for
the
court
or
for
the
jury.
this
court
in
miller
in
the
miller
case,
a
case
with
substantially
similar
factual
background
as
in
this
case
held
that
it
was
for
the
trial
court
to
rule
upon
and
not
a
jury
question.
in
that
case,
the
respondents,
when
he
tried
it
to
put
on
evidence
with
relation
to
the
valuation
of
the
particular
parcel
and
the
government
attorney
objected
because
whatever
he
offered
included
enhancement
and
the
court
took
part
in
the
questioning
and
specifically
directed
the
witness
not
to
include
that
enhancement
in
that
testimony
and
this
was
a
direct
ruling
by
the
court
on
that
question.
but
in
the
latter
part
of
the
opinion
there
is
a
reference
to
jury
instructions
given
by
the
court
and
with
relation
to
these
instructions,
the
court
commented
that
these
instructions
were
not
wrong.
it's
this
portion
of
the
--
this
court's
decision
that
has
caused
much
difficulty
in
the
courts
below.
i
maintain
that
the
opinion
means
and
it
meant
that
it
was
a
question
for
the
court.
the
later
comment
in
the
instruction,
it
was
really
not
an
instruction
given
the
jury
any
leeway
as
to
deciding
one
way
or
the
other,
it
was
a
comment
by
the
court
that
you
shall
not
with
relation
to
this
lot
consider
enhancement.
but
that
was
taken
by
the
sixth
circuit
as
well
as
the
trial
court
to
mean,
well,
there
are
two
portions
of
this
decision
and
therefore
will
let
the
jury
we
have
them.
we
contend
that
that's
a
wrongful
interpretation
of
what
this
court
held
because
the
evidence
of
enhancement
was
not
allowed
at
all.
how
could
the
jury
consider
enhancement
when
it
didn't
have
any
evidence
of
enhancement
before
it?
so
that
was
a
purely
warning
type
of
instruction
and
it's
our
position
that
as
stated
in
the
wardy
case,
at
fifth
circuit
court
decision
which
followed
the
miller
case
as
we
interpreted.
the
circuit
court
in
the
fifth
circuit
well
put
it,
“the
judge
decides
illegal
question
which
limits
the
factors
to
the
determination
of
just
compensation.”
we
further
point
to
rule
71
(a)
(h)
adopted
in
1951,
this
is
the
rule
that
has
to
do
with
eminent
domain.
in
essence,
taken
all
the
portion
with
relation
to
jury
commissioners
and
all
of
that
out,
as
material
in
this
case,
it
reads,
any
party
may
have
a
trial
by
jury
of
the
issue
of
compensation,
then
it
further
states,
trial
of
all
issues
shall
otherwise
be
by
the
court.
as
i
said
this
rule
was
adopted
after
the
miller
decision
but
we
contend
that
the
rule
is
perfectly
consistent
with
our
position
that
legal
questions
which
limit
the
factors
to
the
determination
of
just
compensation
for
the
trial.
in
fact,
when
we
redo,
it
reads
very
much
in
our
favor.
we
do
it
admit
that
it
does
say,
any
party
may
have
trial
by
jury
of
the
issue
of
compensation.
what
our
opponents
are
saying
anything
that
has
remotely
to
do
with
this
compensation
should
be
tried
by
the
jury,
we
disagree.
for
various
reasons,
we
contend
that
in
most
of
these
recreational
area
cases,
there
are
quite
a
few
of
these,
the
government
relies
and
also
the
respondent
relies
on
the
records
of
the
engineers
and
in
this
case,
if
looking
at
both
briefs
as
far
as
the
records
of
the
engineers
there's
no
dispute
as
to
the
fact.
the
personnel
of
the
engineer,
engineers
come
and
testifies
and
that's
so,
that
all
of
this
events
happen
on
so
and
so
a
day.
now,
some
of
these
facts
could
become
very,
very
complicated,
it's
not
a
simple
as
in
this
case.
we
have
a
case
called
the
crans
case
from
the
eighth
circuit,
which
not
only
--
there
was
a
general
indication
of
recreational
areas
and
then
the
recreational
area
was
determined
but
they
also
have
public
hearings
and
at
the
time
of
this
public
hearings
the
public
attends
and
sometimes
this
areas
are
changed.
in
other
words
they
become
very,
very
complicated
and
usually
as
i
have
said
before
in
the
crans
case,
the
facts,
there
were
no
disputes
as
to
the
records
of
the
engineer's
office.
and
so
both
counsels
stipulated,
well,
that's
a
question
for
the
court,
there's
nothing
to
argue
about
this
that
the
court
decided
and
by
a
preliminary
hearing,
a
very
orderly
way
to
decide
a
case
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
whether
the
area
in
dispute
is
within
the
scope
of
the
project
in
the
reynolds'
case.
if
it's
within
the
scope
of
the
project
then
enhancement
is
not
allowed,
enhancement
by
the
very
general
project
that
matters
through.
now,
in
the
crans
case
as
i
said
these
engineering
--
engineers
facts
were
rather
complicated
but
it
was
disposed
off
in
that
manner
and
i
think
very
sensibly
so
and
where
there
isn't
much
--
there
isn't
any
dispute
as
to
material
facts,
it
should
be
for
the
court
and
within
this
--
this
preliminary
question
in
the
crans
case
--
there
appeared
to
subsidiary
questions,
one
question
of
governmental
estoppel
because
of
certain
facts,
and
secondly,
authorized
or
unauthorized
act
of
government
officials,
these
issues
aroused.
so,
looking
at
the
crans
case
you
readily
realize
that
these
issues
could
be
very,
very
complicated
and
it's
not
the
type
of
thing
of
question
for
the
jury
and
especially
so
where
the
facts
are
not
disputed.
another
policy
reason
i'd
like
to
advance
is
much
as
possible
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
evaluation
testimony
which
is
not
material
should
not
be
allowed
to
the
jury,
there
maybe
abuses.
now,
in
the
court
below,
let's
take
the
trial
below
to
be
consistent
with
relation
to
the
172
acres
which
is
the
inundated
area,
there's
no
question
about
it.
the
enhancement
is
not
allowed
and
of
course
it
wasn't
raised
but
that's
the
way
the
testimony
is
put
in
and
partly,
if
anybody
raises
the
question
the
court
will
rule,
the
enhancement
will
not
be
allowed.
now,
what
about
with
the
140
acres,
which
remained
under
the
eminent
domain
rules
that
is
an
after
value
so
the
enhancement
is
added
off
to
the
remainder
of
the
problem.
the
judge
in
this
case
rule
that
enhancement
will
be
added
on,
that
was
the
question
for
the
judge.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
the
140
which
is
the
remainder
after
the
78
and
172
were
taken.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
that's
right.
the
enhancement
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
yeah,
the
enhancement
is
added
on.
in
other
words,
the
party
does
not
benefit
by
the
enhanced
value.
now,
those
were
decided
as
preliminary
questions
by
the
court,
so
why
not
with
relation
to
the
78
acres?
now,
if
the
court
with
respect
to
this
question
rules
that
it
is
a
question
before
the
court
because
of
the
peculiar
way
the
verdicts
were
returned,
our
position
is
that
the
sixth
circuit
must
be
reversed,
its
not
a
question
for
the
jury,
the
circuit
court
held
it
was
for
the
jury
so
it
must
be
reversed
with
relation
to
that
but
our
position
is
that
the
verdict
for
$20,000.00
must
be
sustained
because
the
jury
so
found
that
this
is
the
value
without
the
enhancement.
now,
with
relation
if
this
court
decides
the
other
way
that
it
is
a
question
for
the
jury
then
we
had
meant
that
the
case
must
be
remanded
and
a
retrial
had
because
facts
outside
the
record
were
considered
by
the
jury,
at
least
it
was
allowed
to
be
considered.
now,
the
second
issue
which
we
present
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
no.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
no,
the
court
in
its
comment
made
certain
statements
what
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
yes,
the
witness
testified
as
to
the
probability
of
taking
for
recreational
area
and
this
is
the
area
which
the
judge
should
not
have
state
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
that
is
said
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
we
maintain
that
this
is
--
it
should
not
have
gone
to
the
jury
at
all.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
well
that's
–
we
are
saying
that
if
it's
a
question
for
the
court,
then
the
$20,000.00
verdict
should
be
sustained.
but
the
reasoning
of
the
court
that
it
should
have
been
a
question
for
the
jury
--
that
portion
we
want
to
reverse,
that's
all
we
want.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
right
now,
because
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
no,
i
don't
--
the
constitutional
question
was
if
any
well,
gone
into
the
miller
case,
footnotes
about
the
various
cases
at
this
stage
of
the
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
no,
your
honor,
in
eminent
domain
cases
they
haven't
had
jury
trial.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
yes,
with
the
rule,
i
would
say.
now,
we
request
because
of
the
various
rules
that
have
develop
under
this
miller
rule,
we
would
like
to
have
the
court
clarified.
the
rule
and
this
we
asked
in
our
petition
that
this
be
done
and
it
was
granted
by
this
court
and
the
miller
rule
has
been
interpreted
in
the
third
circuit.
the
third
circuit
has
said
that
there
must
be
an
indication
at
the
outset
of
the
project
that
a
particular
track
or
area
will
be
acquired.
now,
this
we
contend
is
a
very
narrow
rule,
that's
a
third
circuit
rule.
in
the
eight
circuit,
it
is
sufficient,
if
it
is
clear
that
some
land
will
be
taken
even
though
the
particular
land
is
not
identified,
that
is
the
rule
in
the
circuit
and
the
eight
circuit
and
that
was
the
rule
in
the
miller
case.
we
contend
and
i
call
this
the
department
of
justice
rule
that
the
rule
should
be
parted.
the
only
requirement
is
that
the
land
was
within
the
general
area
influenced
by
the
project.
and
we
maintain
that
that
should
be
the
rule
because
the
basic
reason
in
the
as
stated
in
the
miller
case
was
that
owners
are
not
to
gain
by
speculating
on
probable
increase
in
value
due
to
governmental
activities.
in
other
words,
the
government
should
not
pay
for
the
value
it
creates.
another
reason
why
the
third
circuit
and
the
eight
circuit
rules
are
unduly
harsh
on
the
government,
if
those
rules
expect
--
adopted
be
very
difficult
to
change
projects.
not
the
whole
project
but
the
scope
in
lines
of
the
project.
as
i
stated
at
the
crans
case
for
example,
the
public
were
here
--
instead
of
the
recreation
area
being
here,
they
wanted
it
over
here.
and
these
changes
are
made
the
engineers,
but
that
should
not
affect
the
individual
owners
because
it
is
within
the
conduct,
the
recreational
areas
were
contemplated
and
the
fact
that
we
take
it
shouldn't
change
the
rule.
if
the
third
circuit
and
the
eight
circuit
rules
are
approved,
we
contend
that
perhaps
government
will
mark
out
a
very
large
project
as
large
as
it
should
and
then
take
with
it.
this
is
what
the
government
did
in
the
(inaudible)
case.
then
we
also
contend
that
these
rules
should
be
consistent
with
relation
to
the
140
acres
which
was
not
taken;
this
is
at
the
most
--
we
talk
about
enhancement.
we
don't
have
much
many
strict
rules
as
to
that,
it
will
--
if
the
remaining
parcel
while
the
value
was
enhanced,
we
added
on
to
that
value
that's
all
that's
to
it.
in
other
words,
it's
in
the
general
vicinity
and
it
has
been
influenced
by
the
state.
now,
what
the
word
scope
of
the
project,
we
finally
contend
as
used
in
the
miller
case
meant
under
the
influence
of
the
project,
this
is
what
it
really
means,
and
if
we
adopt
this
view
which
is
a
view
broader
than
the
third
circuit
and
the
eight
circuit,
i
think
that
justice
be
done
in
all
of
these
cases
and
government
will
not
be
paying
for
the
value
it
creates.
this
is
very,
very
important
for
we
taxpayers.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
no.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
we
maintained
that
it
should
go
back
to
the
circuit
court
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
--
and
the
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
they
took
the
case
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
that's
right,
alright.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
but
i
--
if
it's
sent
back
because
it
was
a
question
for
the
court,
that's
the
alternative
i'm
speaking
of,
right.
i
supposed
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
then
the
jury
found
without
an
enhancement
is
$20,000.00
and
we
maintain
that
under
the
facts
they
don't
argue
any
about
the
facts
as
produced
by
the
engineer
and
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
no,
not
unless
the
trial
judge
himself
decides
that
this
land
was
good
in
the
scope
of
the
project.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
we
didn't
appeal
the--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
that
is
on
the
other
--
other
alternative.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
yes
your
honor
but
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
we
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
we
maintained
that,
it's
for
the
court
to
determine
and
the
appellant
court
on
directive
could
say
that
on
these
facts
under
the
case,
the
miller
case
has
nothing
to
decide
and
so
there
no
enhancement
to
be
given
so
the
verdict
is
$20,000.00.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
no,
i'm
saying
that
it
should
terminate
in
the
circuit
court.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
that
is
correct.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
of
course,
there's
no
issue
as
in
facts.
the
facts
are
just
about
stipulating.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
no
your
honor.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
you
don't
have
to
add,
i
maintain
that
the
--
as
far
as
the
court
of
appeals,
they
don't
have
to
have
all
of
these
maps,
this
could
be
testified
to
and
this
is
what
happened
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
with
relation
to
the
100
and?
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
40?
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
well,
we
have
a
140
acre
track.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
78
acres.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
yes.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
because
all
of
the
material
facts,
there's
no
dispute
and
they
can
see
that,
a
material
facts
to
decide
this
question.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
no,
but
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
the
--
your
honor,
the
172
acres
were
no
question
in
the
original
files,
that's
the
inundated
area.
the
78
acres
was
in
this
twilight
area
where
it
maybe
taken
or
it
may
not
be
taken
because
recreational
areas
were
authorized
to
be
taken
in
reservoir
projects
and
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
that
is
our
position
and
that
is
the
holding
in
the
miller
case,
that's
the
exact
holding
in
the
miller
case
and
this
case
came
exactly
within
the
miller
case.
now,
counsel
mentioned
about
the
nothing
being
marked
out
but
in
this
miller
case,
it
says,
they're
talking
about
the
railroad
right
away.
ultimate
routes
were
surveyed
and
state
that
end
of
all
of
100
feet.
in
other
words,
there
are
various
alternatives
according
to
the
engineering
plan.
it's
not
marked
out
in
the
sense
that
this
is
it.
when
this
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
we
submit
sir.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
review
of
a
session
of
the
sixth
circuit
relating
to
the
scope
of
project
rule
expressed
by
this
court
in
the
miller
case
in
1943,
317
u.s.
369.
briefly,
the
factual
situation
was
first
of
all,
this
had
to
do
with
the
nolin
reservoir
project
in
kentucky.
the
reynolds
owned
a
total
of
390
acres.
the
present
case
is
a
case
of
partial
taking
of
250
acres
out
of
the
390,
in
other
words
after
the
taking
in
this
case
they
were
a
140
acres
remaining.
out
of
the
250
acres,
172
acres
were
for
inundation
and
78
acres
were
for
recreational
purposes
and
it's
the
78
acres
which
causes
the
question
in
this
case.
now,
with
relation
to
the
project,
the
project
was
congressionally
authorized
way
back
in
1958
as
a
flood
control
plan
for
the
ohio
and
mississippi
rivers.
incidentally,
after
1938,
in
1944,
congress
has
passed
the
special
statute
authorizing
acquisition
of
recreational
areas
in
conjunction
with
reservoir
projects.
in
1956,
planning
funds
were
appropriated
for
the
nolin
project
and
in
july
1958,
a
general
design
memoranda
was
approved.
this
design
memoranda,
contained
contemplated
recreational
areas
definitely.
in
september
1958,
funds
were
provided
by
congress
for
the
project
and
in
january
1959,
the
project
was
started.
in
october
1959,
this
78
acres
for
recreational
purpose
was
specifically
set
aside
in
a
memo
by
the
united
states
engineers.
in
april
18th
1962,
a
suit
was
filed
and
declaration
of
taking
filed
in
the
case.
incidentally
going
back,
the
reynolds's
purchased
this
property
in
october
of
1959,
a
portion
of
it
in
october
59
and
the
balance
of
it
in
1960,
of
course
before
the
case
was
filed.
we
have
to
go
into
the
proceedings
in
the
trial
court
to
fully
understand
the
issues.
in
the
trial
court,
the
court
held
with
relation
to
any
enhancement
testimony
as
to
the
78
acres,
this
is
a
recreation
area.
the
court
held
that
it
is
a
question
for
the
trial
court
to
decide
and
it
held
that
it
held
that
it
will
not
allow
any
enhancement
testimony,
this
is
in
the
original,
the
first
portion
of
the
trial.
but
just
before
the
case
went
to
the
jury,
the
court
changed
its
mind
and
said
no
as
to
whether
the
78
acres
was
within
the
scope
of
the
project
or
not,
it
will
allow
the
jury
to
consider
and
so
the
owners
put
on
testimony
with
relation
to
the
78
acres
with
and
without
enhancement.
the
case
went
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
in
this
case
filed
that
the
land
was
probably
within
the
scope
of
the
project
under
the
instructions
of
the
court,
if
that
was
so
then
enhancement
was
not
to
be
allowed.
therefore,
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
only
$20,000.00.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
also
following
the
trial
court
held
that
whether
it
was
in
the
scope
of
the
project
this
question
was
before
the
jury,
but
the
appellant
court
reversed
the
case
as
$20,000.00
verdict
because
the
jury
was
allowed
to
consider
facts
which
were
not
an
evidence,
it
happened
in
this
way.
the
court
at
first
took
the
scope
of
the
project
question
and
testimony
was
adduced
only
before
the
court.
but
later
when
it
changed
its
mind,
the
witnesses
testified
but
government
attorney
did
not
cover
the
testimony
as
fully
as
he
did
just
before
the
court
but
he
remembered
--
but
the
court
in
considering
the
evidence
---
commenting
on
the
evidence
went
back
to
the
evidence
he
heard
while
he
was
sitting
at
the
court
and
in
this
mix
up,
the
grounds
for
reversal
came
up,
i
will
go
back
to
this
later.
so
the
issue
--
the
first
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
scope
of
the
project
question
is
a
determination
for
the
court
or
for
the
jury.
this
court
in
miller
in
the
miller
case,
a
case
with
substantially
similar
factual
background
as
in
this
case
held
that
it
was
for
the
trial
court
to
rule
upon
and
not
a
jury
question.
in
that
case,
the
respondents,
when
he
tried
it
to
put
on
evidence
with
relation
to
the
valuation
of
the
particular
parcel
and
the
government
attorney
objected
because
whatever
he
offered
included
enhancement
and
the
court
took
part
in
the
questioning
and
specifically
directed
the
witness
not
to
include
that
enhancement
in
that
testimony
and
this
was
a
direct
ruling
by
the
court
on
that
question.
but
in
the
latter
part
of
the
opinion
there
is
a
reference
to
jury
instructions
given
by
the
court
and
with
relation
to
these
instructions,
the
court
commented
that
these
instructions
were
not
wrong.
it's
this
portion
of
the
--
this
court's
decision
that
has
caused
much
difficulty
in
the
courts
below.
i
maintain
that
the
opinion
means
and
it
meant
that
it
was
a
question
for
the
court.
the
later
comment
in
the
instruction,
it
was
really
not
an
instruction
given
the
jury
any
leeway
as
to
deciding
one
way
or
the
other,
it
was
a
comment
by
the
court
that
you
shall
not
with
relation
to
this
lot
consider
enhancement.
but
that
was
taken
by
the
sixth
circuit
as
well
as
the
trial
court
to
mean,
well,
there
are
two
portions
of
this
decision
and
therefore
will
let
the
jury
we
have
them.
we
contend
that
that's
a
wrongful
interpretation
of
what
this
court
held
because
the
evidence
of
enhancement
was
not
allowed
at
all.
how
could
the
jury
consider
enhancement
when
it
didn't
have
any
evidence
of
enhancement
before
it?
so
that
was
a
purely
warning
type
of
instruction
and
it's
our
position
that
as
stated
in
the
wardy
case,
at
fifth
circuit
court
decision
which
followed
the
miller
case
as
we
interpreted.
the
circuit
court
in
the
fifth
circuit
well
put
it,
“the
judge
decides
illegal
question
which
limits
the
factors
to
the
determination
of
just
compensation.”
we
further
point
to
rule
71
(a)
(h)
adopted
in
1951,
this
is
the
rule
that
has
to
do
with
eminent
domain.
in
essence,
taken
all
the
portion
with
relation
to
jury
commissioners
and
all
of
that
out,
as
material
in
this
case,
it
reads,
any
party
may
have
a
trial
by
jury
of
the
issue
of
compensation,
then
it
further
states,
trial
of
all
issues
shall
otherwise
be
by
the
court.
as
i
said
this
rule
was
adopted
after
the
miller
decision
but
we
contend
that
the
rule
is
perfectly
consistent
with
our
position
that
legal
questions
which
limit
the
factors
to
the
determination
of
just
compensation
for
the
trial.
in
fact,
when
we
redo,
it
reads
very
much
in
our
favor.
we
do
it
admit
that
it
does
say,
any
party
may
have
trial
by
jury
of
the
issue
of
compensation.
what
our
opponents
are
saying
anything
that
has
remotely
to
do
with
this
compensation
should
be
tried
by
the
jury,
we
disagree.
for
various
reasons,
we
contend
that
in
most
of
these
recreational
area
cases,
there
are
quite
a
few
of
these,
the
government
relies
and
also
the
respondent
relies
on
the
records
of
the
engineers
and
in
this
case,
if
looking
at
both
briefs
as
far
as
the
records
of
the
engineers
there's
no
dispute
as
to
the
fact.
the
personnel
of
the
engineer,
engineers
come
and
testifies
and
that's
so,
that
all
of
this
events
happen
on
so
and
so
a
day.
now,
some
of
these
facts
could
become
very,
very
complicated,
it's
not
a
simple
as
in
this
case.
we
have
a
case
called
the
crans
case
from
the
eighth
circuit,
which
not
only
--
there
was
a
general
indication
of
recreational
areas
and
then
the
recreational
area
was
determined
but
they
also
have
public
hearings
and
at
the
time
of
this
public
hearings
the
public
attends
and
sometimes
this
areas
are
changed.
in
other
words
they
become
very,
very
complicated
and
usually
as
i
have
said
before
in
the
crans
case,
the
facts,
there
were
no
disputes
as
to
the
records
of
the
engineer's
office.
and
so
both
counsels
stipulated,
well,
that's
a
question
for
the
court,
there's
nothing
to
argue
about
this
that
the
court
decided
and
by
a
preliminary
hearing,
a
very
orderly
way
to
decide
a
case
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
whether
the
area
in
dispute
is
within
the
scope
of
the
project
in
the
reynolds'
case.
if
it's
within
the
scope
of
the
project
then
enhancement
is
not
allowed,
enhancement
by
the
very
general
project
that
matters
through.
now,
in
the
crans
case
as
i
said
these
engineering
--
engineers
facts
were
rather
complicated
but
it
was
disposed
off
in
that
manner
and
i
think
very
sensibly
so
and
where
there
isn't
much
--
there
isn't
any
dispute
as
to
material
facts,
it
should
be
for
the
court
and
within
this
--
this
preliminary
question
in
the
crans
case
--
there
appeared
to
subsidiary
questions,
one
question
of
governmental
estoppel
because
of
certain
facts,
and
secondly,
authorized
or
unauthorized
act
of
government
officials,
these
issues
aroused.
so,
looking
at
the
crans
case
you
readily
realize
that
these
issues
could
be
very,
very
complicated
and
it's
not
the
type
of
thing
of
question
for
the
jury
and
especially
so
where
the
facts
are
not
disputed.
another
policy
reason
i'd
like
to
advance
is
much
as
possible
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
evaluation
testimony
which
is
not
material
should
not
be
allowed
to
the
jury,
there
maybe
abuses.
now,
in
the
court
below,
let's
take
the
trial
below
to
be
consistent
with
relation
to
the
172
acres
which
is
the
inundated
area,
there's
no
question
about
it.
the
enhancement
is
not
allowed
and
of
course
it
wasn't
raised
but
that's
the
way
the
testimony
is
put
in
and
partly,
if
anybody
raises
the
question
the
court
will
rule,
the
enhancement
will
not
be
allowed.
now,
what
about
with
the
140
acres,
which
remained
under
the
eminent
domain
rules
that
is
an
after
value
so
the
enhancement
is
added
off
to
the
remainder
of
the
problem.
the
judge
in
this
case
rule
that
enhancement
will
be
added
on,
that
was
the
question
for
the
judge.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
the
140
which
is
the
remainder
after
the
78
and
172
were
taken.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
that's
right.
the
enhancement
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
yeah,
the
enhancement
is
added
on.
in
other
words,
the
party
does
not
benefit
by
the
enhanced
value.
now,
those
were
decided
as
preliminary
questions
by
the
court,
so
why
not
with
relation
to
the
78
acres?
now,
if
the
court
with
respect
to
this
question
rules
that
it
is
a
question
before
the
court
because
of
the
peculiar
way
the
verdicts
were
returned,
our
position
is
that
the
sixth
circuit
must
be
reversed,
its
not
a
question
for
the
jury,
the
circuit
court
held
it
was
for
the
jury
so
it
must
be
reversed
with
relation
to
that
but
our
position
is
that
the
verdict
for
$20,000.00
must
be
sustained
because
the
jury
so
found
that
this
is
the
value
without
the
enhancement.
now,
with
relation
if
this
court
decides
the
other
way
that
it
is
a
question
for
the
jury
then
we
had
meant
that
the
case
must
be
remanded
and
a
retrial
had
because
facts
outside
the
record
were
considered
by
the
jury,
at
least
it
was
allowed
to
be
considered.
now,
the
second
issue
which
we
present
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
no.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
no,
the
court
in
its
comment
made
certain
statements
what
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
yes,
the
witness
testified
as
to
the
probability
of
taking
for
recreational
area
and
this
is
the
area
which
the
judge
should
not
have
state
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
that
is
said
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
we
maintain
that
this
is
--
it
should
not
have
gone
to
the
jury
at
all.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
well
that's
–
we
are
saying
that
if
it's
a
question
for
the
court,
then
the
$20,000.00
verdict
should
be
sustained.
but
the
reasoning
of
the
court
that
it
should
have
been
a
question
for
the
jury
--
that
portion
we
want
to
reverse,
that's
all
we
want.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
right
now,
because
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
no,
i
don't
--
the
constitutional
question
was
if
any
well,
gone
into
the
miller
case,
footnotes
about
the
various
cases
at
this
stage
of
the
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
no,
your
honor,
in
eminent
domain
cases
they
haven't
had
jury
trial.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
yes,
with
the
rule,
i
would
say.
now,
we
request
because
of
the
various
rules
that
have
develop
under
this
miller
rule,
we
would
like
to
have
the
court
clarified.
the
rule
and
this
we
asked
in
our
petition
that
this
be
done
and
it
was
granted
by
this
court
and
the
miller
rule
has
been
interpreted
in
the
third
circuit.
the
third
circuit
has
said
that
there
must
be
an
indication
at
the
outset
of
the
project
that
a
particular
track
or
area
will
be
acquired.
now,
this
we
contend
is
a
very
narrow
rule,
that's
a
third
circuit
rule.
in
the
eight
circuit,
it
is
sufficient,
if
it
is
clear
that
some
land
will
be
taken
even
though
the
particular
land
is
not
identified,
that
is
the
rule
in
the
circuit
and
the
eight
circuit
and
that
was
the
rule
in
the
miller
case.
we
contend
and
i
call
this
the
department
of
justice
rule
that
the
rule
should
be
parted.
the
only
requirement
is
that
the
land
was
within
the
general
area
influenced
by
the
project.
and
we
maintain
that
that
should
be
the
rule
because
the
basic
reason
in
the
as
stated
in
the
miller
case
was
that
owners
are
not
to
gain
by
speculating
on
probable
increase
in
value
due
to
governmental
activities.
in
other
words,
the
government
should
not
pay
for
the
value
it
creates.
another
reason
why
the
third
circuit
and
the
eight
circuit
rules
are
unduly
harsh
on
the
government,
if
those
rules
expect
--
adopted
be
very
difficult
to
change
projects.
not
the
whole
project
but
the
scope
in
lines
of
the
project.
as
i
stated
at
the
crans
case
for
example,
the
public
were
here
--
instead
of
the
recreation
area
being
here,
they
wanted
it
over
here.
and
these
changes
are
made
the
engineers,
but
that
should
not
affect
the
individual
owners
because
it
is
within
the
conduct,
the
recreational
areas
were
contemplated
and
the
fact
that
we
take
it
shouldn't
change
the
rule.
if
the
third
circuit
and
the
eight
circuit
rules
are
approved,
we
contend
that
perhaps
government
will
mark
out
a
very
large
project
as
large
as
it
should
and
then
take
with
it.
this
is
what
the
government
did
in
the
(inaudible)
case.
then
we
also
contend
that
these
rules
should
be
consistent
with
relation
to
the
140
acres
which
was
not
taken;
this
is
at
the
most
--
we
talk
about
enhancement.
we
don't
have
much
many
strict
rules
as
to
that,
it
will
--
if
the
remaining
parcel
while
the
value
was
enhanced,
we
added
on
to
that
value
that's
all
that's
to
it.
in
other
words,
it's
in
the
general
vicinity
and
it
has
been
influenced
by
the
state.
now,
what
the
word
scope
of
the
project,
we
finally
contend
as
used
in
the
miller
case
meant
under
the
influence
of
the
project,
this
is
what
it
really
means,
and
if
we
adopt
this
view
which
is
a
view
broader
than
the
third
circuit
and
the
eight
circuit,
i
think
that
justice
be
done
in
all
of
these
cases
and
government
will
not
be
paying
for
the
value
it
creates.
this
is
very,
very
important
for
we
taxpayers.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
no.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
we
maintained
that
it
should
go
back
to
the
circuit
court
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
--
and
the
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
they
took
the
case
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
that's
right,
alright.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
but
i
--
if
it's
sent
back
because
it
was
a
question
for
the
court,
that's
the
alternative
i'm
speaking
of,
right.
i
supposed
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
then
the
jury
found
without
an
enhancement
is
$20,000.00
and
we
maintain
that
under
the
facts
they
don't
argue
any
about
the
facts
as
produced
by
the
engineer
and
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
no,
not
unless
the
trial
judge
himself
decides
that
this
land
was
good
in
the
scope
of
the
project.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
we
didn't
appeal
the--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
that
is
on
the
other
--
other
alternative.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
yes
your
honor
but
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
we
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
we
maintained
that,
it's
for
the
court
to
determine
and
the
appellant
court
on
directive
could
say
that
on
these
facts
under
the
case,
the
miller
case
has
nothing
to
decide
and
so
there
no
enhancement
to
be
given
so
the
verdict
is
$20,000.00.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
no,
i'm
saying
that
it
should
terminate
in
the
circuit
court.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
that
is
correct.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
of
course,
there's
no
issue
as
in
facts.
the
facts
are
just
about
stipulating.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
no
your
honor.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
you
don't
have
to
add,
i
maintain
that
the
--
as
far
as
the
court
of
appeals,
they
don't
have
to
have
all
of
these
maps,
this
could
be
testified
to
and
this
is
what
happened
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
with
relation
to
the
100
and?
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
40?
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
well,
we
have
a
140
acre
track.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
78
acres.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
yes.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
because
all
of
the
material
facts,
there's
no
dispute
and
they
can
see
that,
a
material
facts
to
decide
this
question.
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
no,
but
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
the
--
your
honor,
the
172
acres
were
no
question
in
the
original
files,
that's
the
inundated
area.
the
78
acres
was
in
this
twilight
area
where
it
maybe
taken
or
it
may
not
be
taken
because
recreational
areas
were
authorized
to
be
taken
in
reservoir
projects
and
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
that
is
our
position
and
that
is
the
holding
in
the
miller
case,
that's
the
exact
holding
in
the
miller
case
and
this
case
came
exactly
within
the
miller
case.
now,
counsel
mentioned
about
the
nothing
being
marked
out
but
in
this
miller
case,
it
says,
they're
talking
about
the
railroad
right
away.
ultimate
routes
were
surveyed
and
state
that
end
of
all
of
100
feet.
in
other
words,
there
are
various
alternatives
according
to
the
engineering
plan.
it's
not
marked
out
in
the
sense
that
this
is
it.
when
this
--
mr.
shiro
kashiwa
we
submit
sir.
