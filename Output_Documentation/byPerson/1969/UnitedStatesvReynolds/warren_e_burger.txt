mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief

warren
e.

mr.
solomon.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
the
second
stage?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
i
understand
you
mr.
solomon
to
use
the
term
original
design
and
scope
of
the
project
as
being
synonymous?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
right.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
i
understand
the
miller
language,
being
aside
of
this
specific
factual
situation
in
miller
and
taking
the
language,
it
is
that
--
if
it
is
land
which
might
or
which
might
not
be
taken
but
is
ultimately
taken,
the
enhancement
of
the
value
by
the
first
stage
taking
may
not
be
allowed
and
the
jury
is
to
be
so
instructed,
isn't
that
the
miller
held?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
certainly
at
one
category
in
there,
there
might
or
might
not
be
taken
there.
there
is
a
gray
zone
between
the
original
plan
and
the
perhaps
nearby
adjacent
property
and
the
government's
claim
is
that
this
property
in
question
here
falls
in
that
gray
zone
which
is
the
might
or
might
be
taken
language
of
miller?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
miller
doctrine,
the
court
goes
on
to
explain
that
the
theory
behind
that
is
that
the
man
--
that
all
of
the
people
should
not
pay
for
the
value
which
the
taxes
of
all
of
the
people
--
the
value
which
the
taxes
of
all
the
people
have
created.
now,
it's
essentially
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
this
is
--
i
think
this
is
case
of
this
court,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
its
understanding
of
the
miller
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
attorney
generals
arguments
is
directed
to,
he
wants
us
to
clear
that
up?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
we
would
like
to
clear
that
one
way
and
he
wants
to
clear
it
up
the
other
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
supposed
theirs
a
difference
in
the
condemnation
under
eminent
domain
and
that
the
money
of
all
the
people
that's
involve,
public
moneys
involved
and
the
one
private
properties
involved
in
the
other?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
i
read
judge
swinford's
comments
in
the
record
mr.
solomon,
there
seems
to
be
a
little
bit
more
than
a
feeling
of
ambiguity
about
the
miller
opinion,
he
said
the
miller
opinion
is
controlling
and
that
he
questioned
the
soundness
of
the
miller
opinion
and
it
seems
to
have
been
influence
to
go
off
on
his
own
because
of
that,
he
said
“i
question
the
solemnest
of
the
rule
with
all
due
respect
to
the
supreme
court”.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
as
a
practical
matter,
i'm
not
sure
about
this
but
as
a
practical
matter,
if
your
review
of
the
rule
were
to
be
adopted
as
the
standard,
wouldn't
that
leave
the
engineers
to
pick
the
largest
possible
area
for
the
project
and
then
not
worry
about
whether
they
took
it
all
or
not?
and
we
--
one
way
of
treating
them
--
meeting
the
problem
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn't
it
be
normal
and
reasonable
to
resolve
all
the
doubts
in
favor
of
having
the
largest
possible
areas
as
to
avoid
this
enhancement
you
call?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
supposed
the
answer
to
that
issue
don't
and
your
camp
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
many
times
for
these
improvements,
the
government,
all
governments,
local,
states
and
federal
make
it
a
point
to
keep
this
a
very
great
secret
so
that
they
don't
encourage
speculators,
isn't
that
a
practical
fact
of
life?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
the
public
policy
is
not
to
let
speculators
speculate
at
the
expense
of
the
taxpayers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.

you

chief

e.

i

when

finished
