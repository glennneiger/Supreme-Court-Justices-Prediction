unknown
speaker
i
gather
in
this
case,
even
if
we
disagree
with
you
and
agree
with
--
unknown
speaker
--
the
government
that
enhancements
initiating
for
the
judge
to
decide,
there
is
still
has
to
be
a
new
trial
on
this
case
though?
unknown
speaker
it
just
means
that
when
you
go
to
trial
the
second
time
if
you
must,
you
may
get
something
less
than
$20,000.00,
in
any
event
nothing
more,
is
that
it?
well,
you
don't
know
what
a
second
jury
will
give
you.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you
--
it
will
--
whatever
they
--
it
gives
you,
it
will
have
to
be
without
enhancement
if
this
case
goes
against
you
here.
unknown
speaker
not
necessarily,
you
might
be
able
to
convince
the
judge
and
you
might
never
convince
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
the
judge
may
decide
against
the
government?
unknown
speaker
on
whether
these
lands
are
within
the
scope
of
the
project?
unknown
speaker
and
now,
what
--
to
all
--
the
government
not
going
to
--
if
the
government
prevails
here
is
not
going
to
escape
a
new
trial.
there's
still
going
to
have
to
be
new
trials,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
then
they
may
have
in
the
second
trial
twice
as
much
damages
or
word
against
him?
unknown
speaker
and
they
may
lose
on
the
scope
the
project
question
to?
unknown
speaker
before
the
judge?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
don't
have
that
case
before
us
today
though,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
i
am
right
in
this
issue
that
this
case
has
to
go
back
for
re-determination
of
compensation?
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
now,
you
didn't
take
the
case
to
the
circuit
court,
did
you?
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
they
didn't
like
--
they
thought
they
got
enough
for
$20,000.00?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
that's
possible.
i
supposed
we
agree
with
you
that's
for
the
court,
then
what
happens
in
this
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
in
the
government's
position
that
if
you
prevail
here,
you're
entitled
to
reinstatement
of
the
$20,000.00
verdict?
unknown
speaker
no
you're
wrong
because
we
maintain
as
a
matter
of
that
with
all
of
the
facts
as
agreed
upon
even
in
their
brief
i
say
these
are
the
facts.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
isn't
what
you
asked
for
in
the
brief.
all
you've
asked
for
in
the
brief,
your
conclusion
is
that
that
we
direct
the
district
court
on
remand
to
determine
itself
whether
the
condemned
lands
were
within
the
scope
of
the
project.
you
didn't
say
anything
about
reinstating
the
$20,000.00
verdict.
under
any
circumstances
that's
what
your
brief
says.
unknown
speaker
and
you
never
asked
this
and
you
never
ask
the
court
of
appeals
as
ordered
a
new
trial
based
on
some
comments,
improper
comments
with
the
judge.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
i
know
you
didn't
but
the
court
of
appeals
has
ordered
a
new
trial
based
on
--
and
you
didn't
--
you
up
here
have
not
said
the
court
of
appeal
was
wrong
in
ordering
a
new
trial
on
that
basis.
unknown
speaker
now,
the
thing
comes
down
to
this,
if
the
issue
you
brought
to
us
is
whether
enhancement
should
have
been
determined
by
the
court
or
by
they
jury.
and
if
you
prevail
as
i
see
it
from
what
you've
asked,
the
relief
you've
asked.
you're
not
calling
with
the
order
that
you
have
to
have
a
new
trial?
unknown
speaker
and
there
have
to
be
a
brand
new
determination
of
compensation
after
the
judge
if
you
prevail
here,
determines
whether
this
was
within
the
scope
of
the
project?
unknown
speaker
and
you
may
really
get
a
sucking
this
time.
unknown
speaker
and
what
if
the
judge,
what
if
we
follow
that
request
in
your
brief
that
the
very
least
that
i
would
suppose
the
case
to
go
back
with
the
district
courts
like
you
say
into
it
and
the
judge
--
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
what
you
say.
you
say
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
modified
with
instruction
to
direct
the
district
court
on
remand
to
determine
itself
whether
the
condemned
land
were
within
the
scope
of
the
project
under
a
clarified
standards
set
fort
by
the
court,
that's
what
you've
asked
for.
unknown
speaker
an
order
--
the
trial
judge
then
determines
that
these
lands
were
not
within
the
scope
of
the
project,
then
there
would
have
to
be
a
re-determination
of
compensation?
unknown
speaker
but
are
you
suggesting
the
court
of
appeals
should
as
a
matter
of
law,
determines
whether
this
land
was
within
the
scope
of
the
project?
unknown
speaker
you
want
us
to
decide
it
here?
unknown
speaker
why
don't
you
ask
us
to
decide
thing?
why
don't
you
asked
us
to
decide
as
to
--
unknown
speaker
you
want
to
give
us
all
those
records
and
drawings
and
designs
and
all
the
rest
of
us
and
help
us
to
--
unknown
speaker
well
then,
why
would
you
have
the
court
of
appeals
do
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
78.
unknown
speaker
i
gather
in
this
case,
even
