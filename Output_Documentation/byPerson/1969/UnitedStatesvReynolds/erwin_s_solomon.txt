mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
if
the
court
pleases.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
first,
i
would
like
to
correct
that
certain
statement
said,
i
know
were
inadvertently
inherent.
one,
there's
a
crucial
date,
i
reviewed
the
dates
again
because
our
position
is
this.
the
miller
--
the
miller
case
and
i
will
go
into
the
factual
situation
in
a
minute.
but
the
miller
case,
we
say
stand
for
the
proposition
that
if
in
the
original
design
over
project,
the
land
is
delineated
to
be
taken
or
as
in
the
miller
case
if
it
were
marked
out
or
designated
that
it
would
probably
be
taken,
then
there
is
no
enhanced
value.
if
it's
in
the
original
scope
and
the
original
plans,
no
one
has
value
or
as
the
in
the
miller
case,
where
there
was
a
railroad
right
of
way
over
areas
to
be
flooded
and
they
had
marked
out
amusement,
the
terminology
of
the
court
in
its
opinion.
marked
out
or
designated
where
this
right
of
way
should
be
that's
why
they
used
the
words
probably
would
have
taken
or
when
the
government
was
committed
to
it.
and
those
two
instances,
we
state
that
there
would
be
no
enhancement,
however,
as
in
our
case
where
the
government
in
its
original
desire
and
then
in
a
later
desire
did
not
take
in
the
property,
the
78
acres
but
later
did
so
in
a
third
memo,
as
we
say
an
after
thought
then
we
believe
we
are
entitled
to
the
enhance
value
of
that
land.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
the
second
stage
was
eliminated,
your
honor.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
and
erroneously,
i
want
to
give
the
date
of
that
in
this
particular
case.
for
instance,
it
was
stated
that
construction
funds
were
appropriate
in
september,
october
of
58,
construction
was
started
in
january
59
and
in
june
17th
of
59,
there
was
a
designed
memo
outlining
the
recreational
areas
which
did
not
contain
the
--
what
we
call
the
site
of
the
78
acres.
it
did
not
contain
it.
it
did
--
in
other
words,
in
july
14th,
58,
when
the
government
approve
the
general
design
memo
which
contained
all
phases
of
the
construction
and
land
acquisition,
it
was
in
that,
the
78
acres
was
not
in
there
and
it
was
in
the
memo
for
recreational
areas
of
june
17,
1959,
the
government
admits
this
in
it's
brief.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
no,
sir.
i'm
saying
that
in
the
miller
case
they
used
it
synonymously
and
i
think
that's
what
--
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
if
you
know
the
--
if
the
court
would
realize
the
factual
situation
in
miller
case
and
then
i
think
the
ambiguities
of
the
terminology
in
the
vagueness
of
the
verbiage
and
phrases
in
the
miller
would
be
dissipated,
knowing
the
factual
situation
where
in
the
miller
case,
in
the
original
design,
they
had
marked
out
or
designated
where
they
were
going
to
take
it
right
of
way.
they
didn't
take
it
originally
but
they
had
marked
it
out
and
designated
to
be
taken,
and
then
they
did
take
it
and
the
court
said
if
it
probably
would
have
been
in
the
scope
originally
which
it
was
because
it
was
marked
out
on
that
map,
then
it's
probably
in
the
scope.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
there
were
no
maps
filed
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
the
design
memo
was
not
filed
in
this
case.
the
government
did
not
file
it
but
the
testimony
of
max
bohr
who
was
a
governor
--
the
government
witness
refers
to
these
design
memos
and
the
dates.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes
sir
and
that's
why
--
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes,
sir.
as
stated
by
the
government,
the
justice
department,
the
judge
in
the
--
the
trial
judge
had
upheld
a
hearing
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury,
to
begin
with
to
see
whether
as
a
matter
of
law,
he
could
determine
whether
this
land
was
entitled
to
enhance
value
or
not
being
whether
or
not
it
was
in
the
scope
of
the
project
or
not
and
the
government
called
its
witness
from
the
core
of
engineers.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
then
the
other
inverting
error
of
the
justice
department
was
that
while
that
opening
statement
was
being
made,
not
when
the
jury
was
being
charged
but
when
the
opening
statement
was
being
made,
the
judge
called
counsel
to
the
bench
and
said
that
he
was
in
error
in
his
first
finding
saying
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
no
one
has
or
would
be
allowed.
he
said,
on
further
perusing
the
miller
case
while
we're
making
an
open
statement,
he
said
he
found
it
was
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
therefore,
it
would
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
it
wasn't,
it
wasn't
during
opening
statement
that
were
made
and
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
then,
as
i
remember
the
counsel
for
respondent
asked
whether
he
could
amend
his
opening
statement
and
the
court
will
have
him
do
so.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
miller
has
that
verbiage
your
honor
but
then
it
goes
on
and
says
other
things
that
if
you're
adjacent
land
owner
and
this
is
where
you
get
in
trouble
for,
we're
reading
the
miller
case
and
i
think
that's
where
the
trial
court
reverse
itself.
in
reading
the
miller
case,
it
goes
on
to
say
that
if
it's
merely
adjacent
lands
and
not
originally
contemplated
in
the
scope
then
it
shall
take
the
enhanced
value.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
well
if
you
--
that's
where
our
argument
is,
your
honor
that
you
have
to
go
back
in
miller's
factual
situation,
where
it
was
actually
laid
out
in
the
original
design
and
marked
out
and
that's
what
they're
talking
about
that
the
adjacent
land
and
there
shall
not
be
a
windfall
when
it
was
marked
out
in
the
original
design
it
was
well
known,
this
was
not
the
case
here.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
well,
that's
one
view
the
third
circuit
held
differently.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
the
miller
case
is
yes
sir
but
i
think
this
is
what
--
there
is
a
variance
between
the
different
circuits
at
this
point
based
on
calculation.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
misunderstanding
of
the
miller
case.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes
sir,
that's
because
the
vagueness
of
the
language
in
the
miller
case.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes,
sir
and
we
--
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
but
we
--
we
would
like
to
clear
it
up
this
way
that
we're
taking
the
position
that
where
the
original
design
and
that's
why
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
acreage
that
was
taken
below
the
566
foot
level
of
the
reservoir
which
is
about
172
acres.
we
had
no
quarrel
because
that
was
in
the
original
design.
we
say
we
are
not
entitled
to
enhancement
but
the
78
acres,
which
was
not
an
original
design
or
in
the
design
of
june
17th
59,
we
say
there
that
we
are
entitled
to
the
enhancement,
we
would
--
we're
requesting
respectfully
for
this
court
that
the
government
should
not
play
around
with
other
peoples
land
and
they
are
here
for
instance,
we
take
this
view,
assume
one
improves
his
house
and
land
around
it,
and
it
raises
the
value
of
his
neighbor's
land,
next
to
it,
and
his
neighbors
land
comes
up
for
sale,
isn't
he
going
to
have
to
pay
the
enhanced
value?
and
we
say
this
true
whether
it's
a
government
or
a
neighbor
or
anyone
else,
that
taking
of
land
up,
we
take
the
position
to
begin
with
as
(inaudible)
unless
the
safeguards
are
put
around
the
taking.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
what
is
the
instruction
that
was
given
to
the
jury
on
the
condemnation
cases,
a
fair
market
value,
a
willing
buyer
who
is
not
forced
to
buy
and
a
willing
seller
who
is
not
willing
to
sale
and
that
determines
the
fair
market
value.
the
government
should
not
have
the
edge
so
to
speak,
it
should
be
a
fair
market
value
based
on
other
values.
around
this
lake
your
honor,
there
is
a
at
least
500
acres.
they
have
taken
eight
sites
leaving
i
assumed
--
i
believe
i
have
--
right
about
250
to
300
more
acres.
now,
what
is
the
value
of
the
acreage
not
taken,
it
is
enhanced
by
the
lake
value.
why
should
the
government
take
land
at
a
lower
evaluation
if
it's
not
in
the
original
designed
memo?
why
shouldn't
that
man
be
put
on
the
part
of
the
condemned
with
another
land
owner
by
his
side?
we
have
on
this
piece
of
land,
there's
a
man
by
the
name
of
slarv,
has
a
land,
he
has
an
enhanced
value,
we
don't,
why
not?
it
is
because
the
government
is
a
taker,
is
that
the
measure.
we
say
it
should
not
be.
i'd
like
to
get
on
the
red
damage
to
the
residue
to
show
inequity
of
the
government
in
this
case.
there
is
a
residue
of
a
140
acres.
now,
according
to
the
trial
court,
the
government
could
show
the
enhanced
value
of
the
damages
to
the
residue.
in
other
word,
they
could
show
how
the
lake
enhanced
the
value
of
the
140
acres
that
was
left
over
and
subtract
that
from
any
award
made
by
that
jury.
now,
where
is
the
equity
in
that
where
the
government
says,
we
can
have
be
enhance
value
where
the
residue
is
concerned
but
you
can
have
it,
were
taking
the
land
and
this
is
in
the
equities
that
we
run
into
in
this
type
of
cases
and
i
agree
that
the
miller
case,
in
some
way
as
the
trial
court
in
page
48-49,
of
the
appendix
stated
several
times
that
it
was
a
very
taxing
face
to
try
to
govern
before
the
jury.
now,
as
far
as
the
rules
71
(a)
(h)
is
concerned
and
submitting
to
the
jury,
the
court,
trial
court
and
we
think
probable
--
properly
held
if
these
cases
are
mixed
question
of
law.
in
fact,
we
don't
say
it
is,
we
think
it's
a
matter
of
law
only,
and
law
our
way
and
that
the
land
was
not
in
the
scope
or
was
not
in
the
original
design
or
in
a
second
design
memo.
but
if
it
is
a
question
of
law
in
fact,
that
it
should
be
submitted
to
the
jury
because
as
the
sixth
circuit
held
in
its
opinion,
compensation
and
whether
there's
an
enhancement
or
not,
where
is
a
mix
question
of
law,
in
fact
are
interrelated
and
to
arrive
at
a
proper
evaluation,
you
must
determine
whether
its
enhanced
and
not
to
begin
with,
and
that
what's
the
instruction
of
the
court
gave
to
the
jury.
we
came
out
on
the
short
if
but
if
it's
a
proper
question
of
law
in
fact,
it
should
be
submitted
to
the
jury
so
that
the
proper
compensation
can
be
given
to
the
land
owner.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes
sir.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes
sir
because
the
jury
and
advertently
the
trial
court
--
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
you
don't
know
what
a
second
jury
would
give?
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
it
depends
--
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
exact
words.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes
sir.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes
sir,
exactly
and
it
depends
upon
which
fact
if
you're
going
to
take.
does
the
government
have
to
give
--
have
lands
in
the
original
design
member?
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes
sir.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes
sir.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes
sir.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes
sir.
it
depends
on
what
this
court
enunciates
as
its
rule.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
however,
he
made
through
it
if
you
--
through
out
the
record,
it's
before
the
court
and
all
justice
--
justice,
to
justice
swinford,
he
said
that
miller
case
would
be
controlling
and
he
tried
to
control
it
under
that
case
even
though
he
did
not.
he
said
that
it
led
to
ambiguities.
in
page
49,
it
says
now
that
--
that
is
why
i'm
going
to
have
to
instruct
the
jury
under
this
miller
case
very
frankly.
as
i
said,
i
think
the
rule
might
be
somewhat
modified.
i
think
it
should
be
but
i'm
bound
by
it,
i
can't
modify
it.
and
he
goes
on
to
another
place
to
say
it's
not
up
to
his
court
to
modify
it
and
he
was
going
to
be
bound
by
it
but
he
makes
remarks
throughout
that
it's
a
--
in
this
particular
factual
situation
that
we
had,
it
was
hard
to
apply
and
he
--
the
reason
that
he
inadvertently
in
summing
up
to
the
jury
exposed
what
went
on
when
the
jury
was
exploited
was
because
he
tried
to
explain
the
miller
case
to
the
jury
in
layman's
language
and
got
involved,
but
he
did
try
to
abide
by
the
miller
case
but
the
factual
situation
as
i
said
before
in
that
miller
case,
it
rarely
explains
the
miller
case,
its
when
the
miller
case
is
taken
out
of
context
without
realizing
what
the
factual
situation
was,
i
think
that's
where
the
courts
are
getting
in
trouble
and
are
misconstruing.
the
miller
case
uses
fake
language.
it
uses
language
like
probability
of
the
scope
of
the
project.
the
--
what
is
a
contemplated
taking
of
the
government?
well,
who
knows
what
the
contemplated
taking
at
that
time
of
the
original
design
would
be?
these
all
lead
to
uncertainties,
something
that
a
good
practitioner
tries
to
avoid
in
the
will
or
deed
and
yet
here
in
this
case
in
trying
to
fix
compensation,
the
uncertainties
and
i
agreed
with
the
justice
department,
it
should
be
cleared
up
but
we
feel
that
it
should
be
cleared
up
our
way.
the
government's
position
is
they
want
to
enlarge
the
miller
case
and
said
that
if
the
land
is
in
the
general
area
influenced
by
the
project,
there
shall
be
no
enhancement.
now,
i
say
if
they
would
prevail,
you
get
into
another
ambiguity.
you're
leaving
it
to
the
lower
court
again
to
determine
what
might
be
in
the
general
area.
and
we
say
it's
the
original
design
memo,
let
the
core
of
engineers
take
in
what
they
will.
in
my
section
of
country
they
have.
we're
building
a
gap
right
now
and
they
have
taken
all
the
land
around
it.
if
they
want
to
take
it
all
in,
let
them
do
original.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
that
might
be
one
way.
i'm
assuming
the
court
of
engineers
are
pretty
well
qualified
and
they
could
do
better
than
take
a
shotgun
approach
to
taking.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
that's
one
way
they
could
get
around
it
but
if
your
honor
pleases,
at
what
point
is
adjacent
land
owner
allowed
to
develop
his
land
under
the
present
rule?
how
do
you
know
that
the
government
won't
come
in
two
years
later
and
say
this
was
within
the
scope
of
the
original
plan,
there's
the
uncertainty
right
there?
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
the
--
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
i
agree
but
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
speculating.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
right
sir,
but
there's
different
type
of
speculation.
i'm
saying
that
after
the
government
takes
and
assumed
that
that
lake
is
there
for
five
years
and
then
the
government
comes
and
said
that
was
in
the
scope
of
our
original
plan
or
is
it
just
a
part
would
have
the
court
that
this
is
in
the
general
areas.
and
supposed
roads
have
been
put
in
at
that
time,
things
of
that
sort,
it
would
go
back
to
the
un-enhanced
value.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
but
this
no
sir.
but
this
is
on
a
140
acres,
if
they
come
to
take
it,
roads
were
put
in
there.
yes
sir
that
would
happen
in
this
case
if
they
went
and
condemned
the
residue
that
is
a
fact
of
life
in
the
residue
of
this
property
right
now.
so
it
does
this
theoretically
or
even
practically
it
could
happen
on
this
piece
of
land
belonging
to
the
reynolds.
they
have
roads
and
have
in
the
enjoining
acres
or
the
residue.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
if
the
court
pleases.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
first,
i
would
like
to
correct
that
certain
statement
said,
i
know
were
inadvertently
inherent.
one,
there's
a
crucial
date,
i
reviewed
the
dates
again
because
our
position
is
this.
the
miller
--
the
miller
case
and
i
will
go
into
the
factual
situation
in
a
minute.
but
the
miller
case,
we
say
stand
for
the
proposition
that
if
in
the
original
design
over
project,
the
land
is
delineated
to
be
taken
or
as
in
the
miller
case
if
it
were
marked
out
or
designated
that
it
would
probably
be
taken,
then
there
is
no
enhanced
value.
if
it's
in
the
original
scope
and
the
original
plans,
no
one
has
value
or
as
the
in
the
miller
case,
where
there
was
a
railroad
right
of
way
over
areas
to
be
flooded
and
they
had
marked
out
amusement,
the
terminology
of
the
court
in
its
opinion.
marked
out
or
designated
where
this
right
of
way
should
be
that's
why
they
used
the
words
probably
would
have
taken
or
when
the
government
was
committed
to
it.
and
those
two
instances,
we
state
that
there
would
be
no
enhancement,
however,
as
in
our
case
where
the
government
in
its
original
desire
and
then
in
a
later
desire
did
not
take
in
the
property,
the
78
acres
but
later
did
so
in
a
third
memo,
as
we
say
an
after
thought
then
we
believe
we
are
entitled
to
the
enhance
value
of
that
land.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
the
second
stage
was
eliminated,
your
honor.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
and
erroneously,
i
want
to
give
the
date
of
that
in
this
particular
case.
for
instance,
it
was
stated
that
construction
funds
were
appropriate
in
september,
october
of
58,
construction
was
started
in
january
59
and
in
june
17th
of
59,
there
was
a
designed
memo
outlining
the
recreational
areas
which
did
not
contain
the
--
what
we
call
the
site
of
the
78
acres.
it
did
not
contain
it.
it
did
--
in
other
words,
in
july
14th,
58,
when
the
government
approve
the
general
design
memo
which
contained
all
phases
of
the
construction
and
land
acquisition,
it
was
in
that,
the
78
acres
was
not
in
there
and
it
was
in
the
memo
for
recreational
areas
of
june
17,
1959,
the
government
admits
this
in
it's
brief.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
no,
sir.
i'm
saying
that
in
the
miller
case
they
used
it
synonymously
and
i
think
that's
what
--
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
if
you
know
the
--
if
the
court
would
realize
the
factual
situation
in
miller
case
and
then
i
think
the
ambiguities
of
the
terminology
in
the
vagueness
of
the
verbiage
and
phrases
in
the
miller
would
be
dissipated,
knowing
the
factual
situation
where
in
the
miller
case,
in
the
original
design,
they
had
marked
out
or
designated
where
they
were
going
to
take
it
right
of
way.
they
didn't
take
it
originally
but
they
had
marked
it
out
and
designated
to
be
taken,
and
then
they
did
take
it
and
the
court
said
if
it
probably
would
have
been
in
the
scope
originally
which
it
was
because
it
was
marked
out
on
that
map,
then
it's
probably
in
the
scope.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
there
were
no
maps
filed
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
the
design
memo
was
not
filed
in
this
case.
the
government
did
not
file
it
but
the
testimony
of
max
bohr
who
was
a
governor
--
the
government
witness
refers
to
these
design
memos
and
the
dates.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes
sir
and
that's
why
--
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes,
sir.
as
stated
by
the
government,
the
justice
department,
the
judge
in
the
--
the
trial
judge
had
upheld
a
hearing
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury,
to
begin
with
to
see
whether
as
a
matter
of
law,
he
could
determine
whether
this
land
was
entitled
to
enhance
value
or
not
being
whether
or
not
it
was
in
the
scope
of
the
project
or
not
and
the
government
called
its
witness
from
the
core
of
engineers.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
then
the
other
inverting
error
of
the
justice
department
was
that
while
that
opening
statement
was
being
made,
not
when
the
jury
was
being
charged
but
when
the
opening
statement
was
being
made,
the
judge
called
counsel
to
the
bench
and
said
that
he
was
in
error
in
his
first
finding
saying
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
no
one
has
or
would
be
allowed.
he
said,
on
further
perusing
the
miller
case
while
we're
making
an
open
statement,
he
said
he
found
it
was
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
therefore,
it
would
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
it
wasn't,
it
wasn't
during
opening
statement
that
were
made
and
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
then,
as
i
remember
the
counsel
for
respondent
asked
whether
he
could
amend
his
opening
statement
and
the
court
will
have
him
do
so.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
miller
has
that
verbiage
your
honor
but
then
it
goes
on
and
says
other
things
that
if
you're
adjacent
land
owner
and
this
is
where
you
get
in
trouble
for,
we're
reading
the
miller
case
and
i
think
that's
where
the
trial
court
reverse
itself.
in
reading
the
miller
case,
it
goes
on
to
say
that
if
it's
merely
adjacent
lands
and
not
originally
contemplated
in
the
scope
then
it
shall
take
the
enhanced
value.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
well
if
you
--
that's
where
our
argument
is,
your
honor
that
you
have
to
go
back
in
miller's
factual
situation,
where
it
was
actually
laid
out
in
the
original
design
and
marked
out
and
that's
what
they're
talking
about
that
the
adjacent
land
and
there
shall
not
be
a
windfall
when
it
was
marked
out
in
the
original
design
it
was
well
known,
this
was
not
the
case
here.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
well,
that's
one
view
the
third
circuit
held
differently.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
the
miller
case
is
yes
sir
but
i
think
this
is
what
--
there
is
a
variance
between
the
different
circuits
at
this
point
based
on
calculation.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
misunderstanding
of
the
miller
case.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes
sir,
that's
because
the
vagueness
of
the
language
in
the
miller
case.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes,
sir
and
we
--
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
but
we
--
we
would
like
to
clear
it
up
this
way
that
we're
taking
the
position
that
where
the
original
design
and
that's
why
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
acreage
that
was
taken
below
the
566
foot
level
of
the
reservoir
which
is
about
172
acres.
we
had
no
quarrel
because
that
was
in
the
original
design.
we
say
we
are
not
entitled
to
enhancement
but
the
78
acres,
which
was
not
an
original
design
or
in
the
design
of
june
17th
59,
we
say
there
that
we
are
entitled
to
the
enhancement,
we
would
--
we're
requesting
respectfully
for
this
court
that
the
government
should
not
play
around
with
other
peoples
land
and
they
are
here
for
instance,
we
take
this
view,
assume
one
improves
his
house
and
land
around
it,
and
it
raises
the
value
of
his
neighbor's
land,
next
to
it,
and
his
neighbors
land
comes
up
for
sale,
isn't
he
going
to
have
to
pay
the
enhanced
value?
and
we
say
this
true
whether
it's
a
government
or
a
neighbor
or
anyone
else,
that
taking
of
land
up,
we
take
the
position
to
begin
with
as
(inaudible)
unless
the
safeguards
are
put
around
the
taking.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
what
is
the
instruction
that
was
given
to
the
jury
on
the
condemnation
cases,
a
fair
market
value,
a
willing
buyer
who
is
not
forced
to
buy
and
a
willing
seller
who
is
not
willing
to
sale
and
that
determines
the
fair
market
value.
the
government
should
not
have
the
edge
so
to
speak,
it
should
be
a
fair
market
value
based
on
other
values.
around
this
lake
your
honor,
there
is
a
at
least
500
acres.
they
have
taken
eight
sites
leaving
i
assumed
--
i
believe
i
have
--
right
about
250
to
300
more
acres.
now,
what
is
the
value
of
the
acreage
not
taken,
it
is
enhanced
by
the
lake
value.
why
should
the
government
take
land
at
a
lower
evaluation
if
it's
not
in
the
original
designed
memo?
why
shouldn't
that
man
be
put
on
the
part
of
the
condemned
with
another
land
owner
by
his
side?
we
have
on
this
piece
of
land,
there's
a
man
by
the
name
of
slarv,
has
a
land,
he
has
an
enhanced
value,
we
don't,
why
not?
it
is
because
the
government
is
a
taker,
is
that
the
measure.
we
say
it
should
not
be.
i'd
like
to
get
on
the
red
damage
to
the
residue
to
show
inequity
of
the
government
in
this
case.
there
is
a
residue
of
a
140
acres.
now,
according
to
the
trial
court,
the
government
could
show
the
enhanced
value
of
the
damages
to
the
residue.
in
other
word,
they
could
show
how
the
lake
enhanced
the
value
of
the
140
acres
that
was
left
over
and
subtract
that
from
any
award
made
by
that
jury.
now,
where
is
the
equity
in
that
where
the
government
says,
we
can
have
be
enhance
value
where
the
residue
is
concerned
but
you
can
have
it,
were
taking
the
land
and
this
is
in
the
equities
that
we
run
into
in
this
type
of
cases
and
i
agree
that
the
miller
case,
in
some
way
as
the
trial
court
in
page
48-49,
of
the
appendix
stated
several
times
that
it
was
a
very
taxing
face
to
try
to
govern
before
the
jury.
now,
as
far
as
the
rules
71
(a)
(h)
is
concerned
and
submitting
to
the
jury,
the
court,
trial
court
and
we
think
probable
--
properly
held
if
these
cases
are
mixed
question
of
law.
in
fact,
we
don't
say
it
is,
we
think
it's
a
matter
of
law
only,
and
law
our
way
and
that
the
land
was
not
in
the
scope
or
was
not
in
the
original
design
or
in
a
second
design
memo.
but
if
it
is
a
question
of
law
in
fact,
that
it
should
be
submitted
to
the
jury
because
as
the
sixth
circuit
held
in
its
opinion,
compensation
and
whether
there's
an
enhancement
or
not,
where
is
a
mix
question
of
law,
in
fact
are
interrelated
and
to
arrive
at
a
proper
evaluation,
you
must
determine
whether
its
enhanced
and
not
to
begin
with,
and
that
what's
the
instruction
of
the
court
gave
to
the
jury.
we
came
out
on
the
short
if
but
if
it's
a
proper
question
of
law
in
fact,
it
should
be
submitted
to
the
jury
so
that
the
proper
compensation
can
be
given
to
the
land
owner.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes
sir.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes
sir
because
the
jury
and
advertently
the
trial
court
--
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
you
don't
know
what
a
second
jury
would
give?
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
it
depends
--
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
exact
words.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes
sir.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes
sir,
exactly
and
it
depends
upon
which
fact
if
you're
going
to
take.
does
the
government
have
to
give
--
have
lands
in
the
original
design
member?
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes
sir.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes
sir.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes
sir.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
yes
sir.
it
depends
on
what
this
court
enunciates
as
its
rule.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
however,
he
made
through
it
if
you
--
through
out
the
record,
it's
before
the
court
and
all
justice
--
justice,
to
justice
swinford,
he
said
that
miller
case
would
be
controlling
and
he
tried
to
control
it
under
that
case
even
though
he
did
not.
he
said
that
it
led
to
ambiguities.
in
page
49,
it
says
now
that
--
that
is
why
i'm
going
to
have
to
instruct
the
jury
under
this
miller
case
very
frankly.
as
i
said,
i
think
the
rule
might
be
somewhat
modified.
i
think
it
should
be
but
i'm
bound
by
it,
i
can't
modify
it.
and
he
goes
on
to
another
place
to
say
it's
not
up
to
his
court
to
modify
it
and
he
was
going
to
be
bound
by
it
but
he
makes
remarks
throughout
that
it's
a
--
in
this
particular
factual
situation
that
we
had,
it
was
hard
to
apply
and
he
--
the
reason
that
he
inadvertently
in
summing
up
to
the
jury
exposed
what
went
on
when
the
jury
was
exploited
was
because
he
tried
to
explain
the
miller
case
to
the
jury
in
layman's
language
and
got
involved,
but
he
did
try
to
abide
by
the
miller
case
but
the
factual
situation
as
i
said
before
in
that
miller
case,
it
rarely
explains
the
miller
case,
its
when
the
miller
case
is
taken
out
of
context
without
realizing
what
the
factual
situation
was,
i
think
that's
where
the
courts
are
getting
in
trouble
and
are
misconstruing.
the
miller
case
uses
fake
language.
it
uses
language
like
probability
of
the
scope
of
the
project.
the
--
what
is
a
contemplated
taking
of
the
government?
well,
who
knows
what
the
contemplated
taking
at
that
time
of
the
original
design
would
be?
these
all
lead
to
uncertainties,
something
that
a
good
practitioner
tries
to
avoid
in
the
will
or
deed
and
yet
here
in
this
case
in
trying
to
fix
compensation,
the
uncertainties
and
i
agreed
with
the
justice
department,
it
should
be
cleared
up
but
we
feel
that
it
should
be
cleared
up
our
way.
the
government's
position
is
they
want
to
enlarge
the
miller
case
and
said
that
if
the
land
is
in
the
general
area
influenced
by
the
project,
there
shall
be
no
enhancement.
now,
i
say
if
they
would
prevail,
you
get
into
another
ambiguity.
you're
leaving
it
to
the
lower
court
again
to
determine
what
might
be
in
the
general
area.
and
we
say
it's
the
original
design
memo,
let
the
core
of
engineers
take
in
what
they
will.
in
my
section
of
country
they
have.
we're
building
a
gap
right
now
and
they
have
taken
all
the
land
around
it.
if
they
want
to
take
it
all
in,
let
them
do
original.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
that
might
be
one
way.
i'm
assuming
the
court
of
engineers
are
pretty
well
qualified
and
they
could
do
better
than
take
a
shotgun
approach
to
taking.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
that's
one
way
they
could
get
around
it
but
if
your
honor
pleases,
at
what
point
is
adjacent
land
owner
allowed
to
develop
his
land
under
the
present
rule?
how
do
you
know
that
the
government
won't
come
in
two
years
later
and
say
this
was
within
the
scope
of
the
original
plan,
there's
the
uncertainty
right
there?
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
the
--
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
i
agree
but
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
speculating.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
right
sir,
but
there's
different
type
of
speculation.
i'm
saying
that
after
the
government
takes
and
assumed
that
that
lake
is
there
for
five
years
and
then
the
government
comes
and
said
that
was
in
the
scope
of
our
original
plan
or
is
it
just
a
part
would
have
the
court
that
this
is
in
the
general
areas.
and
supposed
roads
have
been
put
in
at
that
time,
things
of
that
sort,
it
would
go
back
to
the
un-enhanced
value.
mr.
erwin
s.
solomon
but
this
no
sir.
but
this
is
on
a
140
acres,
if
they
come
to
take
it,
roads
were
put
in
there.
yes
sir
that
would
happen
in
this
case
if
they
went
and
condemned
the
residue
that
is
a
fact
of
life
in
the
residue
of
this
property
right
now.
so
it
does
this
theoretically
or
even
practically
it
could
happen
on
this
piece
of
land
belonging
to
the
reynolds.
they
have
roads
and
have
in
the
enjoining
acres
or
the
residue.
thank
you
sir.
