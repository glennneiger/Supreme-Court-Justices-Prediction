justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
the
court
decides
on
these
records?
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
know,
you're
talking
now
about
what
acreage?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see,
it's
the
part
not
taken
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
of
this
--
of
this
party's
land?
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
an
argument
that
more
evidence
wanting
the
jury
on
the
--
should
have
gotten
to
the
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
the
jury
found
against
enhancement?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
let's
assume
that
same
thing
is
telling
the
jury
that
there
is
the
record
something
that
is
not
at
all,
is
that
right?
what
was
the
comment
of
the
judge?
he
said
something
that
the
jury
about
evidence
which
was
not
heard
by
the
jury,
wasn't
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
even
though
the
judge
told
the
jury
that,
the
jury
found
there
was
no
enhancement,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
$20,000.00
verdict
was
a
verdict
based
on
the
finding
of
no
enhancement,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
appreciate
that
but
how
will
you
have
heard
by
going
to
the
jury
if
the
jury
came
in
with
a
$20,000.00
verdict
on
the
basis
of
no
enhancement?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
first
branch
of
your
case
that
you've
been
arguing
right
now?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
see
in
advancing
that
argument
any
constitutional
difficulties
of
any
kind
i'm
referring
to
the
seventh
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
but
i'm
talking
to
the
--
about
the
constitutional
right
of
jury
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
just
as
the
matter
of
the
statute
between
the
two?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solomon,
where
are
all
these
maps
filed,
where'd
you
find
all
of
this?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
mean
where
is
the
original
design?
justice
potter
stewart
you'll
have
to
get
the
internal
records
of
some
government,
departments
that's
condemning
the
land,
is
that
it?
discover?
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
you
discovered
what
originally
was
contemplated
and
what
was
mapped
out
and
drawn
out,
is
that
the
way
it
was?
justice
potter
stewart
then
they
introduced
the
designs
and
the
technology
of
things,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
their
understanding
of
the
miller
case?
justice
