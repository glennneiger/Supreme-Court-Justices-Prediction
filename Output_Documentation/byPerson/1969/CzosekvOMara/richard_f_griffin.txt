mr.
richard
f.
griffin
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
behalf
of
the
erie
lackawanna,
the
respondent
employer
in
the
case,
basically,
it's
our
position
that
we
had
a
right
to
have
the
question
of
this
matter
of
whether
the
furloughing
or
discharge
was
right
or
wrong,
whether
it
had
anything
to
do
with
the
merger,
but
basically,
this
is
a
question
of
an
interpretation
of
agreements
and
then
under
the
railway
labor
act
that
the
design
of
that
is
that
where
agreements
are
interpreted
in
this
type
of
dispute
that
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
is
the
one
to
interpret
the
agreements
and
accordingly,
the
plaintiffs
had
an
obligation
to
take
the
case
there.
mr.
richard
f.
griffin
yes.
mr.
richard
f.
griffin
no
your
honor.
mr.
richard
f.
griffin
am
i
objecting
to
that?
mr.
richard
f.
griffin
yes
your
honor.
mr.
richard
f.
griffin
no
i
did
not
--
mr.
richard
f.
griffin
that's
correct
in
terms
of
a
petition
your
honor.
mr.
richard
f.
griffin
no
i
haven't
filed
any
formal
petition.
my
understanding
was
that
all
questions
are
before
the
court
and
this
court
has
the
power
in
the
posture
that
it
is
to
order
reinstatement
of
the
district
court
decision
which
dismissed
as
against
all
defendants
without
any
leave.
and
furthermore,
although
the
main
thrust
of
the
union's
argument
is
that
the
complaint
should
be
dismissed
as
against
it.
it
also
in
its
brief
makes
certain
implicitly
alternative
arguments
as
against
the
railroad.
mr.
richard
f.
griffin
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
f.
griffin
yes.
mr.
richard
f.
griffin
in
part,
that's
my
purpose
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
richard
f.
griffin
i
think
that
the
--
it's
my
position
that
the
gratuitous
none
asked
for
permission
to
start
in
effect
another
lawsuit
against
the
railroad
that
the
second
circuit
gave
was
improper
and
unnecessary
and
--.
mr.
richard
f.
griffin
it's
a
good
question
and
i'm
frank
to
say
that
your
honor,
i'm
not
able
to
authoritatively
respond.
at
the
time
that
the
petition
on
behalf
of
the
union
was
filed,
i
do
recall
that
in
our
office,
we
went
into
that
thing
and
it's
my
impression,
i
could
be
wrong
that
we
determined
at
that
time
that
if
certiorari
was
granted
by
this
court
on
the
union's
application,
then
the
court
would
have
the
power
once
it
was
granted
to
review
the
particular
issue
that
i'm
referring
to
here.
mr.
richard
f.
griffin
well,
i'm
--
i
was
originally
--
mr.
richard
f.
griffin
that's
right.
was
originally
a
defendant
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
richard
f.
griffin
--then
i
was
an
appellee
in
the
--
mr.
richard
f.
griffin
that's
correct
insofar
--
.
mr.
richard
f.
griffin
that
is
correct.
insofar
--
mr.
richard
f.
griffin
that's
correct.
we
were
there
to
sustain
judge
henderson,
the
district
judge's
decision
that
there
was
no
case
in
effect
that
we
should
be
out
100%.
and
then
the
second
circuit
in
effect
sustained
that
on
the
basis
of
the
case
and
pleadings
before
it
but
as
i
say
gratuitously
gave
leave
for
the
plaintiffs
to
start
in
effect
another
lawsuit
against
us.
mr.
richard
f.
griffin
well
no
one
asked
for
it.
they
say
ab
initio
or
on
its
own
--
mr.
richard
f.
griffin
yes,
we
made
an
application.
mr.
richard
f.
griffin
to
divide
the
time
your
honor.
well,
as
i
say
i
agree
the
kind
of
--
i
apologize
for
our
being
unable
to
answer,
if
authoritative
was
--
that's
my
--
but
on
the
question
which
is
the
other
question
that
i
think
we're
entitled
to
without
question
to
address
ourselves
to
and
that
is
whether
the
railroad
should
be
in
the
case
at
all
and
whether
the
exclusive
remedy
to
the
plaintiffs
is
not
before
the
adjustment
board,
it's
our
position
that
this
case
must
be
in
the
adjustment
board
and
that
the
exceptions
to
that
that
this
court
has
decided
such
as
in
the
glover
case
and
--
mr.
richard
f.
griffin
that's
right.
and
they
never
have
amended
--
mr.
richard
f.
griffin
well,
if
i
knew
--
mr.
richard
f.
griffin
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
f.
griffin
well,
if
i
knew
that
the
union
in
its
brief
did
not
suggest
that
this
court
should
make
some
adverse
determination
and
maybe
keep
us
in
the
lawsuit,
then
as
far
as
that
part
of
it,
i
wouldn't
be
here
and
i
think
that
it's
quite
clear
that
we
shouldn't
be
in
the
lawsuit
and
as
i
think
justice
white
developed
in
the
question,
this
employee
had
all
the
chance
in
the
world
to
go
before
the
adjustment
board,
his
counsel
for
years,
his
counsel
decided
not
to
go
to
the
adjustment
board
and
that
was
--
he
had
every
opportunity
in
the
world,
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
him
but
he
didn't
want
to
go
there
and
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
the
railway
labor
act
provides
exclusive
remedy
and
has
an
obligation
to
go
there.
now,
mr.
shea
and
i
just
will
conclude
with
this
went
outside
the
record
to
argue
about
the
merits
of
the
case
and
i
think
i
have
to
respond
in
this
respect
that
he
says
that
the
erie
railroad
hired
old
employees
of
erie
that
the
merge
railroad
hired
old
employees
to
run
a
new
power
plant
after
the
one
power
plant
was
closed
down
in
buffalo.
well,
that's
not
a
fact
and
it's
not
for
you
to
decide
whether
or
not
it's
a
fact
but
he's
gone
into
it
and
he
never
before
put
this
in
and
they
didn't
build
a
new
power
station
and
hired
new
people
because
in
buffalo,
the
old
lackawanna
had
one
of
these
great
huge
stations
that
you
couldn't
give
away
for
years,
finally
it
was
sold
for
taxes
or
something
and
the
power
plant
that
he
did
it
and
so
on
came
to
an
end
and
that's
where
these
men
worked.
for
the
limited
time
that
there
was
passenger
service,
there
was
a
source
of
steam
elsewhere
in
buffalo
that
was
used
and
they
didn't
build
a
new
power
plant
as
mr.
shea
suggests.
and
accordingly,
that's
why
all
along
they
took
the
position
that
their
jobs
came
to
an
end
due
to
a
railroad
obsolescence,
that
the
merger
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
accordingly
that
there's
no
case.
and
i
think
that
that's
what
the
railroad
adjustment
board
would
hold,
that
there's
no
political
discrimination,
there's
nothing
in
this
case
and
that's
why
there's
never
been
anything
set
forth
in
the
pleadings
because
they
don't
have
anything
to
set
forth.
in
the
glover's
case
where
there
was
a
futility
question,
the
counsel
went
in
great
detail.
and
so
in
conclusion,
it's
our
position
very
basically
that
the
district
court
was
correct
in
dismissing
this
case
100%
as
against
the
defendant
erie
lackawanna,
we
feel
that's
where
we
should
be.
thank
you.
