justice
byron
r.
white
did
he
prevent
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
he
prevail
against
all
sort
of
action
against
the
union
as
such?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
the
--
the
law
doesn't
require,
does
it?
or
may
be
it
does
in
the
railroad
area
that
in
fact
maybe
awarded
upon
reinstatement?
i
suppose
that's
still
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
they
certainly
can
give
it
but
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
board
said,
if
the
board
said,
well
that
the
only
place
you
can
get
a
remedy
for
reinstatement
is
from
the
employer.
the
union
certainly
couldn't
reinstate
him
but
we
think
that
the
only
reason
the
employer
fired
this
man
is
because
of
the
--
as
the
result
of
union's
hostility,
not
because
the
employer
want
to
because
the
union
wanted
the
employer
too.
we
will
not
award
him
back
pay
against
the
employer,
let
him
recover
that
from
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
it
would
be
proper
under
the
law
for
the
board
to
deny
full
back
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
board
can
do
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
board
couldn't
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
could
say
that
you
won't
give
him
back
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
as
against
the
employer
they
could
say,
we
will
not
give
him
back
pay.
he's
going
to
get
any
back
pay,
he
has
to
get
it
from
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
a
pleading
problem,
that's
--
it
may
be
that
the
union,
that
the
employee
against
the
union
can't
prove
its
case,
unless
it
proves
something
like
that
but
it
does
say
that
it
was
--
there
was
hostile
--
the
allegation
is
hostile
discrimination
by
the
union
in
the
complaint?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
it
have
to?
why
isn't
that
a
matter
of
proof
and
discovery,
things
like
that
rather
than
having
to
plead
your
evidence
in
the
complaint?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
doesn't
this
completes
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
complaint
does
allege
possible
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
it
does
--
it
does
allege
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
does
allege
in
so
many
words,
hostile
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
just
one
thing
about
-
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
was
there
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
this
was
in
effect
with
the
merger?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
anything
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
thing
--
is
there
a
provision
in
any
of
the
agreements
which
indicate
that
the
union
has
a
duty,
a
contractual
duty
to
represent
the
employee
before
the
adjustment
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
--
let's
assume
the
union
freely
fits
that
it's
a
good
claim
but
it
just
says
we
don't
normally
undertake
this,
is
the
employee
permitted
to
go
before
the
board
by
the
law
and
let
him
go
by
himself?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
under
the
bargaining
agreement,
are
the
pre-board
steps
of
the
grievance
procedure
operable
by
the
employee
himself
without
the
union's
cooperation?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
from
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
employee
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
employee
is
not
barred
from
the
grievance
procedure
because
the
union
refuses
to
process
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
would
you
get
around
the
rule
that
the
board
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
and
other
grievance
type
of
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
somebody
might
tell
exactly
here
in
this
court
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
railroad
which
i
take
it
would
have
the
right
under
the
law
to
take
that
kind
of
a
case
to
the
board,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
also,
what
if
the
railroad
says
i
insist
on
taking
this
to
the
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
amend
as
the
court
of
appeals
suggest
that
you
might
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you
concede
that
the
railroad
could
take
that
case,
the
collusion
case
forward?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
saying
only
the
discharge
text,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
still
win
your
case
even
if
you
fail
to
win
the
--
even
if
you
fail
in
your
effort
to
join
the
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
why,
why,
your
case
is
dismissed.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
before
in
the
court,
not
dismiss
the
court.
do
you
think
the
second
circuit
conditions
your
right
to
maintain
the
suit
upon
you
joining
the
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
it
didn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
can
still
proceed
against
the
union
even
if
you
didn't
join
the
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
cause
of
action
might
require
some
kind
of
proof
of
employer
participation,
was
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
griffin.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
railroad
hasn't
caused
petitioned
here,
has
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
objecting
to
a
leave
aloud
the
petitioners
to
other
employees
rather
to
amend?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
can
you
--
you
didn't
cross
petition
that
against
you,
did
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
as
i
understand
it,
all
we
have
here
is
the
union's
petition,
isn't
that
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
sharing
respondent's
time
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
additional
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
he
prevent
it?
justice
byron

did
he
prevail
against
all
sort
of
action
against

as
