mr.
richard
r.
lyman
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
justices,
this
is
a
case
which
comes
before
this
court
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
which
partially
reversed
and
partially
affirmed
a
district
court
judgment
granting
motions
to
dismiss
a
complaint.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
before
employees
of
the
erie
lackawanna
railroad
company
which
is
the
railroad
formed
as
the
result
of
the
merger
of
the
former
erie
railroad
and
the
former
delaware
lackawanna
&
western
railroad.
that
merger
took
place
in
1960.
and
in
1962,
the
plaintiffs
and
the
allegations
to
their
complaint
which
of
course
control
the
facts
where
situation
here
were
furloughed
from
their
employment
as
stationary
engineers.
they
alleged
in
the
complaint
several
different
theories
of
action.
they
contend
that
that
furlough
being
allegedly
as
a
result
of
the
merger
of
the
railroads
was
the
violation
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
they
allege
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
implementing
agreement
without
specification
as
to
what
a
implementing
agreement
provided
for
or
what
provisions
were
relied
upon.
they
alleged
that
it
was
further
violative
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
that
they
did
not
receive
30
days
advance
written
notice
of
the
fact
that
they
were
going
to
be
furloughed.
they
alleged
that
they
received
no
compensation
for
their
severance
from
employment
or
severance
pay
to
which
they
say
they
were
entitled
to
by
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
implementing
agreement.
they
assert
that
the
furlough
constituted
a
wrongful
discharge
because
they
were
not
subsequently
recalled
from
the
furlough
or
had
not
been
up
until
the
time
of
the
suit
which
was
filed
in
1967,
a
predicate
jurisdiction
on
diversity
of
citizenship
and
jurisdictional
amounts
on
the
interstate
commerce
act
section
5
at
sec
and
on
the
railroad
--
railway
labor
act.
there
was
no
specification
of
anything
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
upon
which
they
were
relying
to
give
rise
to
this
action.
the
only
specific
jurisdictional
allegation
as
to
the
railway
labor
act
was
this
30
day
notice
provision.
and
finally,
in
addition
to
all
of
these
various
allegations,
they
alleged
that
their
union
failed
and
refused
to
process
the
grievance
and
collect
compensation
for
them
after
they
had
been
furloughed
or
wrongfully
discharged
as
the
case
maybe.
and
they
say
that
this
failure
to
process
the
grievance
amounted
to
hostile
discrimination,
bad
faith
and
so
forth.
the
district
court
sustained
the
motions
to
dismiss
that
were
filed
by
both
defendants.
finding
that
there
was
no
diversity
of
citizenship,
the
defendant
erie
lackawanna
as
a
new
york
corporation
and
the
only
union
defendants
were
sued
--
that
were
sued
were
also
residents
of
the
new
york
state.
it
found
that
there
was
no
basis
for
such
an
action
or
for
jurisdiction
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
that
they
were
not
relying
on
any
provision
of
that
act
or
claiming
any
provision
of
the
statute
had
been
violated
and
that
the
only
thing
they
were
basically
suing
on
was
the
implementing
agreement.
as
to
the
railway
labor
act,
they
said
that
the
adjustment
board
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
contract
claim.
with
respect
to
the
charge
that
the
union
had
failed
to
properly
represent
them,
the
district
court
ruled
that
although
the
plaintiffs
used
the
first
hostile
discrimination
and
alleging
that
they
fail
to
process
their
claims
properly.
use
of
that
phrase
alone
would
not
support
jurisdiction
under
the
railway
labor
act
as
an
unfair
representation
claim.
and
the
district
court
further
pointed
out
that
the
plaintiffs
were
not
attacking
the
validity
of
any
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
they
were
not
claiming
that
they
could
not
personally
pursue
their
administrative
remedies
to
enforce
a
contract
rights
under
that
agreement.
after
that
ruling
by
the
district
court,
plaintiffs
did
not
seek
leave
to
file
an
amended
complaint
or
attempt
to
file
one
but
instead
appeal
from
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
thus,
all
we
have
in
the
record
before
the
court
to
support
the
factual
questions
involved
are
the
complaint,
they're
too
much
to
dismiss,
plus
so
called
affidavits
that
were
filed
with
the
district
court
in
connection
with
those
motions
to
dismiss.
the
unions
defendants,
petitioners
here,
file
a
regular
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
based
on
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
and
failure
to
state
a
claim
and
filed
no
supporting
affidavit,
so
that
it
was
an
ordinary
motion
to
dismiss.
the
railroad's
motion
was
supported
by
an
affidavit
of
counsel
which
appears
at
page
12
of
the
appendix
which
did
recite
some
facts.
on
page
13,
the
second
complete
paragraph
of
the
page
states
the
railroads
version
of
the
facts
out
of
which
the
dispute
arose.
the
plaintiffs
filed
--
the
plaintiff's
attorney
files
his
own
affidavit
in
our
position
to
the
motions
to
dismiss.
appearing
on
page
15
of
the
appendix
and
which
he
does
not
state
any
facts
simply
recites
what
he
contend,
what
he
contended
the
nature
of
the
action
to
be
and
then
recited
and
i
quote
“that
the
plaintiffs
do
not
have
to
allege
facts
or
damages
in
their
complaint
under
the
federal
rules.”
following
this
decision
of
the
district
court,
plaintiff's
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
complaint
was
sufficient
to
state
a
federal
claim
against
the
union
defendants
for
breach
of
they
duty
of
fairer
representation.
but
as
to
the
railroad
defendant,
it
sustained
the
district
court's
dismissal
of
the
complaint
for
the
reason
that
plaintiffs
had
to
assert
there
claim
for
wrongful
discharge
against
the
railroad
exclusively
before
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
and
further
sustain
the
district
court's
other
findings
as
to
the
lack
of
any
substance
and
the
various
jurisdictional
allegations
to
the
complaint.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
employee
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
no.
you
may
not
proceed
against
the
union
only
before
the
adjustment
board.
it
is
our
opinion
or
out
contention
that
an
employee
cannot
by
a
selective
source
of
defendants
have
the
alternative
of
either
collecting
damages
from
his
union
in
a
court
action
or
proceeding
before
the
adjustment
board
against
the
railroad.
if
an
employee
has
an
adequate
administrative
remedy,
we
contend
that
it
must
be
resorted
to
and
exhausted
as
--
or
he
must
attempt
to
exhaust
it
or
show
that
it
would
be
futile
to
do
so
under
the
line
of
medics
in
vaca
against
sipes.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
pardon
me?
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
no
because
the
adjustment
board
will
make
him
entirely
hold
for
the
alleged
wrongful
discharge.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
pardon
me?
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
the
erie
lackawanna
railroad
company.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
because
he
has
recovered
fully
for
any
damage
or
injury
he
suffered.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
that
we
would
contend
not
because
in
the
landmark
case,
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
vaca
against
sipes,
one
of
the
basic
element
which
an
employee
must
sustain
and
action
against
his
union
for
unfair
representation
is
that
his
claim
against
the
company
is
a
good
one
on
the
merits.
now,
this
points
up
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
problem
and
dilemma
that
the
court
of
appeals
left
us
in.
if
he
goes
against
the
railroad
company
before
the
adjustment
board,
the
adjustment
board
holds
in
an
award
which
this
court
has
many
times
ruled,
his
final
and
binding
and
conclusive
and
the
recent
amendments
of
the
statute
say
so.
and
then
he
has
established
the
absence
of
any
valid
claim
on
the
merits
and
we
would
say
then
it
would
be
completely
horrendous,
if
he
could
turn
around
and
collect
his
full
damages
and
an
action
against
the
union
for
unfair
representation.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
the
law
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
they
normally
do,
that
would
depend
on
whether
the
contract
entitled
the
man
to
it
or
not.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
i
have
seen
no
such
awards
and
of
course
you
have
no
assurance.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
well,
under
your
honors
decision
in
vaca
against
sipes,
if
part
of
his
damages
were
attributable
to
the
unions
action,
the
union
of
course
should
asses
--
be
assessed
with
that
liability.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
prorating
process.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
i
don't
see
how
the
board
could
make
the
decision
for
some
court
before
which
the
employer
would
go
against
the
union
and
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
as
against
the
union,
the
union
wouldn't
even
be
a
party
to
the
claim
you
see.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
of
course
in
your
honor's
decision
in
vaca
against
sipes,
you
pointed
out
that
there
is
a
little
different
situation
presented
when
the
--
when
as
in
this
case,
the
charge
of
unfair
representation
is
based
on
failure
to
process
a
grievance
which
is
caused
by
a
completely
unrelated
independent
breach
of
contract
by
the
employer.
there
is
absolutely
no
allegation
in
this
complaint,
no
intimation
in
any
of
the
recitation
of
facts
that
the
union
was
in
any
way
responsible
for
precipitating
the
furlough
or
discharge
of
these
men.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
the
only
factual
allegation
of
the
complaint
to
support
that
conclusory
styling
of
the
action
is
the
allegation
that
the
union
failed
to
process
the
grievance.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
it
alleges
no
motive,
any
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
well,
your
honor
pointed
out
that
hostile
discrimination,
something
akin
to
malice,
actual
malice,
that
sort
of
concept
is
of
the
essence
of
an
unfair
representation
claim.
we
don't
understand
that
a
union
is
going
to
be
penalized
for
maybe
failing
to
properly
asses
the
merits
of
a
claim
unless
there
is
some
basic
invidious
discrimination
that
is
involved
and
as
failure
to
do
so,
that
is
absent
in
this
case.
plaintiffs
try
to
supply
it
by
oral
argument
of
his
counsel
even
though
he
did
not
have
the
district
court
level
at
least
although
he
does
now
want
to
amend
his
complaint.
by
arguing
orally
to
the
court
that
maybe
there
was
a
political
motive
because
these
people
were
laid
off
but
some
former
employees
of
the
former
erie
railroad
were
kept
on
and
that
therefore
there
was
political
discrimination.
no
rational
basis
is
stated
for
any
such
charge
of
political
discrimination
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
its
--
i
might
also
almost
go
back
to
the
words
of
this
court
in
1854
case
wholly
baseless
and
without
reason
to
think
that
a
union
stood
to
achieve
any
political
gain
or
had
any
political
motive
by
merely
failing
to
collect
severance
pay
for
somebody
that
the
company
had
furloughed.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
if
it
was
just
personal
spite
and
malice,
i
think
it
would
be.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
there
is
no
such
allegation
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
nor
does
the
complaint
suggested
or
alleged
it?
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
well,
if
it
is,
there
is
very
little
left
to
the
part
of
rule
12
that
authorizes
the
dismissal
of
complaints
for
failure
to
state
a
claim.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
we're
not
contending
that
that
detailed
facts,
common
law
pleading,
technicalities
must
be
observed,
but
there
must
be
a
pleading
in
the
complaint
of
the
basis
for
the
charge
that
is
being
made
even
though
it's
not
actually
drawn.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
it
alleges
the
pure
conclusion
but
alleges
nothing
except
the
mere
failure
to
process
the
grievance
which
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
which
they
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
it
alleges
that
and
some
--
as
other
picturesque
language
in
the
paragraphs
against
the
union
but
no
facts
except
the
very
fact
of
not
processing
the
grievance.
now,
in
vaca
against
sipes
as
in
2109,
this
court
also
recognized
the
duty
to
exhaust
remedies
or
attempt
to
exhaust
them
as
a
element
of
stating
a
claim
and
that
was
not
done
here
and
in
fact
on
the
record,
in
this
court
of
appeal's
brief,
counsel
for
plaintiffs
alleged
--
admits
that
he
could
have
gone
to
the
adjustment
board,
it's
well
established
that
the
adjustment
board
does
take
and
is
required
to
take
submissions
of
individual
employers
and
that
2153
eastern
case,
the
board
has
in
fact
taken
them.
the
court
of
appeals
in
saying
that
the
plaintiffs
had
to
go
against
the
railroad
before
the
adjustment
board,
admitted
ipso
facto
that
plaintiffs
do
have
a
right
to
go
to
the
board
and
it
remanded
them
to
the
board
where
their
claim
against
the
railroad
which
was
a
claim
for
all
of
the
damages
that
they
have
suffered.
there's
no
intimation
which
supports
in
the
complaint
or
in
the
record
anywhere
that
would
support
allocation
of
any
portion
of
that
remedy
as
against
the
union.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
the
allegation
that
he
didn't
--
that
they
did
not
represent
them
and
prosecute
their
claim
as
a
factual
allegation.
the
other
is
not
the
allegation
in
effect
but
a
conclusion
which,
and
again
relying
upon
vaca
against
sipes,
the
mere
failure
to
represent
in
process
is
not
sufficient,
it
must
be
a
malicious
bad
faith
failure
to
represent
a
process.
a
union
cannot
be
held
to
any
standards
of
competence
such
as
doctor
is
required
to
observe
in
malpractice
suits
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
there
is
nothing
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
we
agree
and
where
some
factual
basis
alleged
other
than
these
bare
statements
showing
that
that
fiduciary
relationship
was
breached.
showing
an
act
which
by
its
nature
would
breach
them,
then
it
would
be
a
different
question.
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
reserve
few
minutes
for
rebuttal
unless
the
court
has
some
further
questions
that
they
wish
to
ask
now?
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
there
of
course
is
all
was
the
so
called
scheduled
agreement
on
these
railroad
setting
forth
the
basic
rates
of
payrolls
and
working
conditions
then
when
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
then
there
was
an
implementing
agreement
to
implement
the
merger.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
not
that
i
know
off.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
and
with
the
union,
railroad
unions
in
general
have
maintained
the
proposition
that
they
may
take
employee's
claims
to
the
adjustment
board
or
they
may
advise
them
that
we
don't
think
this
a
claim
that
has
much
merit
but
you're
free
to
take
it
yourselves
if
you
want
to
but
we
won't
do
it
at
the
union
expense.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes
your
honor.
i
think
the
union
could
lawfully
do
that
and
perhaps
the
remedy
for
that
if
the
employee
wanted
more
extensive
representation
and
activity
by
his
union
representative
as
to
choose
another
union
that
will
give
it
to
him
if
he
won't
get
it
from
that
union.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
we
didn't
get
in
to
that
in
this
case,
on
most
properties,
they
are,
as
implementing
agreement
is
not
before
the
court
in
the
record.
actually,
i
reviewed
it
recently
and
it
is
at
the
initial
stages
to
be
resorted
to
by
the
employee
himself
as
i
read
it.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
no.
and
there
is
i
think
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
--
60
--
within
60
days
of
the
time
he
claims
is
affected
by
the
merger.
the
employee
is
supposed
to
file
on
certain
forms
that
were
supplied,
claim
for
compensation.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
no
your
honor.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
because
the
court
of
appeals
left
us
as
the
sole
defendants
to
defend
against
a
charge
claimed
for
damages
based
on
the
acts
of
the
railroad
company
and
not
on
our
acts.
and
if
the
railroad
had
not
been
made
the
respondents,
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
--we're
out
of
it
and
we
have
to
say
their
burden
according
to
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
under
vaca
against
sipes,
the
court
made
it
very
clear
that
the
railroad
cannot
slip
its
burden
off
paying
for
its
wrongful
breach
of
contract
off
under
the
labor
unions
simply
in
a
situation
were
like
here,
the
union
did
not
process
the
claim
for
the
employees
to
complain
about
what
the
railroad
had
done.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
then
we'll
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes,
because
their
damages
cannot
properly
be
placed
upon
the
union.
now,
they
leave
to
amend,
to
allege
collusion
that
the
court
of
appeals
granted
the
plaintiffs
doesn't
say
this
because
on
a
remand,
suppose,
first
they
may
not
amend,
may
decide
they'd
rather
just
go
against
us
then
we're
out,
we're
lost.
if
they
do
amend
and
then
the
district
court
finds
there
was
no
collusion
as
there
is
no
suggestion
in
this
case
that
there
was
except
in
the
court
of
appeal's
idea
that
maybe
that
was
the
kind
of
an
action
that
could
be
brought
jointly
and
that
if
there
were
no
collusion,
they
could
not
proceed.
if
they
do
amend,
bring
the
railroad
back
in
and
suppose
the
railroad
gets
out
and
maybe
even
on
a
summary
judgment
showing
there's
no
shed
of
support
for
the
charge
of
collusive
action.
then
the
case
would
be
left
in
the
same
posture
that
it
is
now
or
a
purely
independent
act,
breach
of
contract
by
the
railroad
is
being
defended
solely
by
the
union.
and
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes
your
honor
and
we
think
and
we
submit
that
they
did
not
do
so
against
the
union
and
we've
argued
that
at
some
length
in
our
brief
and
decided,
decisions
from
the
sixth
circuit,
the
seventh
circuit,
the
tenth
circuit
which
i
very
clearly
contrary
to
the
holding
of
this
court
of
appeals.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
justices,
this
is
a
case
which
comes
before
this
court
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
which
partially
reversed
and
partially
affirmed
a
district
court
judgment
granting
motions
to
dismiss
a
complaint.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
before
employees
of
the
erie
lackawanna
railroad
company
which
is
the
railroad
formed
as
the
result
of
the
merger
of
the
former
erie
railroad
and
the
former
delaware
lackawanna
&
western
railroad.
that
merger
took
place
in
1960.
and
in
1962,
the
plaintiffs
and
the
allegations
to
their
complaint
which
of
course
control
the
facts
where
situation
here
were
furloughed
from
their
employment
as
stationary
engineers.
they
alleged
in
the
complaint
several
different
theories
of
action.
they
contend
that
that
furlough
being
allegedly
as
a
result
of
the
merger
of
the
railroads
was
the
violation
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
they
allege
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
implementing
agreement
without
specification
as
to
what
a
implementing
agreement
provided
for
or
what
provisions
were
relied
upon.
they
alleged
that
it
was
further
violative
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
that
they
did
not
receive
30
days
advance
written
notice
of
the
fact
that
they
were
going
to
be
furloughed.
they
alleged
that
they
received
no
compensation
for
their
severance
from
employment
or
severance
pay
to
which
they
say
they
were
entitled
to
by
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
implementing
agreement.
they
assert
that
the
furlough
constituted
a
wrongful
discharge
because
they
were
not
subsequently
recalled
from
the
furlough
or
had
not
been
up
until
the
time
of
the
suit
which
was
filed
in
1967,
a
predicate
jurisdiction
on
diversity
of
citizenship
and
jurisdictional
amounts
on
the
interstate
commerce
act
section
5
at
sec
and
on
the
railroad
--
railway
labor
act.
there
was
no
specification
of
anything
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
upon
which
they
were
relying
to
give
rise
to
this
action.
the
only
specific
jurisdictional
allegation
as
to
the
railway
labor
act
was
this
30
day
notice
provision.
and
finally,
in
addition
to
all
of
these
various
allegations,
they
alleged
that
their
union
failed
and
refused
to
process
the
grievance
and
collect
compensation
for
them
after
they
had
been
furloughed
or
wrongfully
discharged
as
the
case
maybe.
and
they
say
that
this
failure
to
process
the
grievance
amounted
to
hostile
discrimination,
bad
faith
and
so
forth.
the
district
court
sustained
the
motions
to
dismiss
that
were
filed
by
both
defendants.
finding
that
there
was
no
diversity
of
citizenship,
the
defendant
erie
lackawanna
as
a
new
york
corporation
and
the
only
union
defendants
were
sued
--
that
were
sued
were
also
residents
of
the
new
york
state.
it
found
that
there
was
no
basis
for
such
an
action
or
for
jurisdiction
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
that
they
were
not
relying
on
any
provision
of
that
act
or
claiming
any
provision
of
the
statute
had
been
violated
and
that
the
only
thing
they
were
basically
suing
on
was
the
implementing
agreement.
as
to
the
railway
labor
act,
they
said
that
the
adjustment
board
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
contract
claim.
with
respect
to
the
charge
that
the
union
had
failed
to
properly
represent
them,
the
district
court
ruled
that
although
the
plaintiffs
used
the
first
hostile
discrimination
and
alleging
that
they
fail
to
process
their
claims
properly.
use
of
that
phrase
alone
would
not
support
jurisdiction
under
the
railway
labor
act
as
an
unfair
representation
claim.
and
the
district
court
further
pointed
out
that
the
plaintiffs
were
not
attacking
the
validity
of
any
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
they
were
not
claiming
that
they
could
not
personally
pursue
their
administrative
remedies
to
enforce
a
contract
rights
under
that
agreement.
after
that
ruling
by
the
district
court,
plaintiffs
did
not
seek
leave
to
file
an
amended
complaint
or
attempt
to
file
one
but
instead
appeal
from
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
thus,
all
we
have
in
the
record
before
the
court
to
support
the
factual
questions
involved
are
the
complaint,
they're
too
much
to
dismiss,
plus
so
called
affidavits
that
were
filed
with
the
district
court
in
connection
with
those
motions
to
dismiss.
the
unions
defendants,
petitioners
here,
file
a
regular
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
based
on
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
and
failure
to
state
a
claim
and
filed
no
supporting
affidavit,
so
that
it
was
an
ordinary
motion
to
dismiss.
the
railroad's
motion
was
supported
by
an
affidavit
of
counsel
which
appears
at
page
12
of
the
appendix
which
did
recite
some
facts.
on
page
13,
the
second
complete
paragraph
of
the
page
states
the
railroads
version
of
the
facts
out
of
which
the
dispute
arose.
the
plaintiffs
filed
--
the
plaintiff's
attorney
files
his
own
affidavit
in
our
position
to
the
motions
to
dismiss.
appearing
on
page
15
of
the
appendix
and
which
he
does
not
state
any
facts
simply
recites
what
he
contend,
what
he
contended
the
nature
of
the
action
to
be
and
then
recited
and
i
quote
“that
the
plaintiffs
do
not
have
to
allege
facts
or
damages
in
their
complaint
under
the
federal
rules.”
following
this
decision
of
the
district
court,
plaintiff's
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
complaint
was
sufficient
to
state
a
federal
claim
against
the
union
defendants
for
breach
of
they
duty
of
fairer
representation.
but
as
to
the
railroad
defendant,
it
sustained
the
district
court's
dismissal
of
the
complaint
for
the
reason
that
plaintiffs
had
to
assert
there
claim
for
wrongful
discharge
against
the
railroad
exclusively
before
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
and
further
sustain
the
district
court's
other
findings
as
to
the
lack
of
any
substance
and
the
various
jurisdictional
allegations
to
the
complaint.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
employee
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
no.
you
may
not
proceed
against
the
union
only
before
the
adjustment
board.
it
is
our
opinion
or
out
contention
that
an
employee
cannot
by
a
selective
source
of
defendants
have
the
alternative
of
either
collecting
damages
from
his
union
in
a
court
action
or
proceeding
before
the
adjustment
board
against
the
railroad.
if
an
employee
has
an
adequate
administrative
remedy,
we
contend
that
it
must
be
resorted
to
and
exhausted
as
--
or
he
must
attempt
to
exhaust
it
or
show
that
it
would
be
futile
to
do
so
under
the
line
of
medics
in
vaca
against
sipes.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
pardon
me?
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
no
because
the
adjustment
board
will
make
him
entirely
hold
for
the
alleged
wrongful
discharge.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
pardon
me?
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
the
erie
lackawanna
railroad
company.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
because
he
has
recovered
fully
for
any
damage
or
injury
he
suffered.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
that
we
would
contend
not
because
in
the
landmark
case,
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
vaca
against
sipes,
one
of
the
basic
element
which
an
employee
must
sustain
and
action
against
his
union
for
unfair
representation
is
that
his
claim
against
the
company
is
a
good
one
on
the
merits.
now,
this
points
up
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
problem
and
dilemma
that
the
court
of
appeals
left
us
in.
if
he
goes
against
the
railroad
company
before
the
adjustment
board,
the
adjustment
board
holds
in
an
award
which
this
court
has
many
times
ruled,
his
final
and
binding
and
conclusive
and
the
recent
amendments
of
the
statute
say
so.
and
then
he
has
established
the
absence
of
any
valid
claim
on
the
merits
and
we
would
say
then
it
would
be
completely
horrendous,
if
he
could
turn
around
and
collect
his
full
damages
and
an
action
against
the
union
for
unfair
representation.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
the
law
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
they
normally
do,
that
would
depend
on
whether
the
contract
entitled
the
man
to
it
or
not.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
i
have
seen
no
such
awards
and
of
course
you
have
no
assurance.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
well,
under
your
honors
decision
in
vaca
against
sipes,
if
part
of
his
damages
were
attributable
to
the
unions
action,
the
union
of
course
should
asses
--
be
assessed
with
that
liability.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
prorating
process.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
i
don't
see
how
the
board
could
make
the
decision
for
some
court
before
which
the
employer
would
go
against
the
union
and
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
as
against
the
union,
the
union
wouldn't
even
be
a
party
to
the
claim
you
see.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
of
course
in
your
honor's
decision
in
vaca
against
sipes,
you
pointed
out
that
there
is
a
little
different
situation
presented
when
the
--
when
as
in
this
case,
the
charge
of
unfair
representation
is
based
on
failure
to
process
a
grievance
which
is
caused
by
a
completely
unrelated
independent
breach
of
contract
by
the
employer.
there
is
absolutely
no
allegation
in
this
complaint,
no
intimation
in
any
of
the
recitation
of
facts
that
the
union
was
in
any
way
responsible
for
precipitating
the
furlough
or
discharge
of
these
men.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
the
only
factual
allegation
of
the
complaint
to
support
that
conclusory
styling
of
the
action
is
the
allegation
that
the
union
failed
to
process
the
grievance.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
it
alleges
no
motive,
any
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
well,
your
honor
pointed
out
that
hostile
discrimination,
something
akin
to
malice,
actual
malice,
that
sort
of
concept
is
of
the
essence
of
an
unfair
representation
claim.
we
don't
understand
that
a
union
is
going
to
be
penalized
for
maybe
failing
to
properly
asses
the
merits
of
a
claim
unless
there
is
some
basic
invidious
discrimination
that
is
involved
and
as
failure
to
do
so,
that
is
absent
in
this
case.
plaintiffs
try
to
supply
it
by
oral
argument
of
his
counsel
even
though
he
did
not
have
the
district
court
level
at
least
although
he
does
now
want
to
amend
his
complaint.
by
arguing
orally
to
the
court
that
maybe
there
was
a
political
motive
because
these
people
were
laid
off
but
some
former
employees
of
the
former
erie
railroad
were
kept
on
and
that
therefore
there
was
political
discrimination.
no
rational
basis
is
stated
for
any
such
charge
of
political
discrimination
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
its
--
i
might
also
almost
go
back
to
the
words
of
this
court
in
1854
case
wholly
baseless
and
without
reason
to
think
that
a
union
stood
to
achieve
any
political
gain
or
had
any
political
motive
by
merely
failing
to
collect
severance
pay
for
somebody
that
the
company
had
furloughed.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
if
it
was
just
personal
spite
and
malice,
i
think
it
would
be.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
there
is
no
such
allegation
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
nor
does
the
complaint
suggested
or
alleged
it?
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
well,
if
it
is,
there
is
very
little
left
to
the
part
of
rule
12
that
authorizes
the
dismissal
of
complaints
for
failure
to
state
a
claim.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
we're
not
contending
that
that
detailed
facts,
common
law
pleading,
technicalities
must
be
observed,
but
there
must
be
a
pleading
in
the
complaint
of
the
basis
for
the
charge
that
is
being
made
even
though
it's
not
actually
drawn.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
it
alleges
the
pure
conclusion
but
alleges
nothing
except
the
mere
failure
to
process
the
grievance
which
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
which
they
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
it
alleges
that
and
some
--
as
other
picturesque
language
in
the
paragraphs
against
the
union
but
no
facts
except
the
very
fact
of
not
processing
the
grievance.
now,
in
vaca
against
sipes
as
in
2109,
this
court
also
recognized
the
duty
to
exhaust
remedies
or
attempt
to
exhaust
them
as
a
element
of
stating
a
claim
and
that
was
not
done
here
and
in
fact
on
the
record,
in
this
court
of
appeal's
brief,
counsel
for
plaintiffs
alleged
--
admits
that
he
could
have
gone
to
the
adjustment
board,
it's
well
established
that
the
adjustment
board
does
take
and
is
required
to
take
submissions
of
individual
employers
and
that
2153
eastern
case,
the
board
has
in
fact
taken
them.
the
court
of
appeals
in
saying
that
the
plaintiffs
had
to
go
against
the
railroad
before
the
adjustment
board,
admitted
ipso
facto
that
plaintiffs
do
have
a
right
to
go
to
the
board
and
it
remanded
them
to
the
board
where
their
claim
against
the
railroad
which
was
a
claim
for
all
of
the
damages
that
they
have
suffered.
there's
no
intimation
which
supports
in
the
complaint
or
in
the
record
anywhere
that
would
support
allocation
of
any
portion
of
that
remedy
as
against
the
union.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
the
allegation
that
he
didn't
--
that
they
did
not
represent
them
and
prosecute
their
claim
as
a
factual
allegation.
the
other
is
not
the
allegation
in
effect
but
a
conclusion
which,
and
again
relying
upon
vaca
against
sipes,
the
mere
failure
to
represent
in
process
is
not
sufficient,
it
must
be
a
malicious
bad
faith
failure
to
represent
a
process.
a
union
cannot
be
held
to
any
standards
of
competence
such
as
doctor
is
required
to
observe
in
malpractice
suits
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
there
is
nothing
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
we
agree
and
where
some
factual
basis
alleged
other
than
these
bare
statements
showing
that
that
fiduciary
relationship
was
breached.
showing
an
act
which
by
its
nature
would
breach
them,
then
it
would
be
a
different
question.
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
reserve
few
minutes
for
rebuttal
unless
the
court
has
some
further
questions
that
they
wish
to
ask
now?
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
there
of
course
is
all
was
the
so
called
scheduled
agreement
on
these
railroad
setting
forth
the
basic
rates
of
payrolls
and
working
conditions
then
when
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
then
there
was
an
implementing
agreement
to
implement
the
merger.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
not
that
i
know
off.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
and
with
the
union,
railroad
unions
in
general
have
maintained
the
proposition
that
they
may
take
employee's
claims
to
the
adjustment
board
or
they
may
advise
them
that
we
don't
think
this
a
claim
that
has
much
merit
but
you're
free
to
take
it
yourselves
if
you
want
to
but
we
won't
do
it
at
the
union
expense.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes
your
honor.
i
think
the
union
could
lawfully
do
that
and
perhaps
the
remedy
for
that
if
the
employee
wanted
more
extensive
representation
and
activity
by
his
union
representative
as
to
choose
another
union
that
will
give
it
to
him
if
he
won't
get
it
from
that
union.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
we
didn't
get
in
to
that
in
this
case,
on
most
properties,
they
are,
as
implementing
agreement
is
not
before
the
court
in
the
record.
actually,
i
reviewed
it
recently
and
it
is
at
the
initial
stages
to
be
resorted
to
by
the
employee
himself
as
i
read
it.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
no.
and
there
is
i
think
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
--
60
--
within
60
days
of
the
time
he
claims
is
affected
by
the
merger.
the
employee
is
supposed
to
file
on
certain
forms
that
were
supplied,
claim
for
compensation.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
no
your
honor.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
because
the
court
of
appeals
left
us
as
the
sole
defendants
to
defend
against
a
charge
claimed
for
damages
based
on
the
acts
of
the
railroad
company
and
not
on
our
acts.
and
if
the
railroad
had
not
been
made
the
respondents,
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
--we're
out
of
it
and
we
have
to
say
their
burden
according
to
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
under
vaca
against
sipes,
the
court
made
it
very
clear
that
the
railroad
cannot
slip
its
burden
off
paying
for
its
wrongful
breach
of
contract
off
under
the
labor
unions
simply
in
a
situation
were
like
here,
the
union
did
not
process
the
claim
for
the
employees
to
complain
about
what
the
railroad
had
done.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
then
we'll
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes,
because
their
damages
cannot
properly
be
placed
upon
the
union.
now,
they
leave
to
amend,
to
allege
collusion
that
the
court
of
appeals
granted
the
plaintiffs
doesn't
say
this
because
on
a
remand,
suppose,
first
they
may
not
amend,
may
decide
they'd
rather
just
go
against
us
then
we're
out,
we're
lost.
if
they
do
amend
and
then
the
district
court
finds
there
was
no
collusion
as
there
is
no
suggestion
in
this
case
that
there
was
except
in
the
court
of
appeal's
idea
that
maybe
that
was
the
kind
of
an
action
that
could
be
brought
jointly
and
that
if
there
were
no
collusion,
they
could
not
proceed.
if
they
do
amend,
bring
the
railroad
back
in
and
suppose
the
railroad
gets
out
and
maybe
even
on
a
summary
judgment
showing
there's
no
shed
of
support
for
the
charge
of
collusive
action.
then
the
case
would
be
left
in
the
same
posture
that
it
is
now
or
a
purely
independent
act,
breach
of
contract
by
the
railroad
is
being
defended
solely
by
the
union.
and
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes
your
honor
and
we
think
and
we
submit
that
they
did
not
do
so
against
the
union
and
we've
argued
that
at
some
length
in
our
brief
and
decided,
decisions
from
the
sixth
circuit,
the
seventh
circuit,
the
tenth
circuit
which
i
very
clearly
contrary
to
the
holding
of
this
court
of
appeals.
