you

does
the

if
so
what

but
if
as
justice
white
suggested,
there
is
some
underlying
hostility
on
the
part
of

officials,
the
steward

therefore
this

we

to
what

violated
the

bargaining
agreement
by
not
representing

now,
how
could

do

say
that's
not
enough

well,
there
are
cases
which

there
are
cases
