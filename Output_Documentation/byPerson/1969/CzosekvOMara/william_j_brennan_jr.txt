whom

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whom
does
the
employee
proceed
against
before
the
board?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right,
and
suppose
if
he
prevails,
i
gather
your
position
as
he
has
no
cause
of
action
against
the
union?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
he
does
not
prevail,
then
does
he
have
a
cause
of
action
against
the
union?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
against
the
union?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
your
evidence
would
have
to
go
to
employer
conduct
whether
or
not
you
amend
it
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you're
not
alleging
a
union
caused
discharge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
just
alleged
remedy
to
discharge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose,
in
this
posture
now
that
employer
were
to
go
to
the
board
on
the
discharge
case,
i
gather
the
railroad
could
do
that,
couldn't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
you're
not
asking
for
reinstatement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
a
determination
of
the
board
favorable
to
the
railroad?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
the
bearing
of
a
determination
of
the
board
in
favor
of
the
railroad
upon
your
lawsuit
against
the
union?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
still
have
your
cause
of
action?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
expect
there
might
be
--
you
don't
concede
there
might
be
any
kind
of
question
at
all
about
your
lawsuit
against
the
union
if
the
board
were
to
find
in
favor
of
the
railroad?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
griffin,
you're
a
respondent,
aren't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ordinarily,
a
respondent
is
here
defending
the
judgment
below,
isn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you're
here
attacking
the
judgment
insofar
as
amendment
against
the
railroad
was
permitted,
aren't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my
question
is
whether
you
can
bring
that
to
us
without
having
cross
petition
against
the
judgment
which
gave
that
leave
to
the
--
your
co-respondents?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
would
you
ever
--
class
as
a
respondent
in
this
case
anyway,
because
you
didn't
petition,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
a
petitioner
you're
a
respondent,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
and
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
wanted
to
sustain
the
district
court's
judgment
of
dismissal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court
and
you
objected
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
and
the
union
argued
together
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whom
does
he
proceed
against
before
the
board,
the
employee?
justice
william
j.
