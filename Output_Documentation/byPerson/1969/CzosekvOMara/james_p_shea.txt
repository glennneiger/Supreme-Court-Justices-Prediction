mr.
james
p.
shea
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
would
appear
that
the
chief
thrust
of
the
petitioner's
argument
of
course
is
against
the
sufficiency
of
the
claims.
with
that
in
mind
to
be
very
candid
to
the
court,
the
employee
respondents
here
rely
on
this
court's
prior
decision
in
conley
versus
gibson.
and
on
page
7
of
our
brief,
we
quote
“what
we
believe
to
be
the
law
of
the
united
states
related
to
the
sufficiency
of
a
complaint
in
the
federal
court.
the
court
indicated
there
that
the
accepted
rule
that
a
complaint
should
not
be
dismissed
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
unless
it
appears
beyond
doubt
that
the
plaintiff
can
prove
no
set
of
facts
in
support
of
his
claim
which
would
entitle
him
to
relief.
”
now,
with
this
in
mind,
this
is
why
i
argued
before
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
outside
the
record
because
there
just
isn't
any
record
here
outside
the
complaint
and
the
affidavits
of
counsel.
and
the
reason
i
did
argue
to
the
second
court
of
appeals
as
to
what
i
believe
is
the
factual
background
and
which
has
not
been
disputed
as
far
as
i
know
by
any
of
the
counsel
here
as
to
the
factual
background
which
underlies
the
complaint
in
this
case.
now,
the
respondent
employees
were
four
former
members
of
the
delaware
lackawanna
&
western
railroad
that
had
varying
periods
of
the
service
with
that
railroad
ranging
from
47
years
to
9
years.
of
course
the
merger
took
place
in
1960
and
these
men
were
employed
as
stationary
engineers
in
the
city
of
buffalo
what
was
known
as
the
michigan
avenue
power
plant.
they
were
laid
off
during
the
summer
which
was
the
usual
procedure
with
the
company.
they
were
not
called
back
to
work
for
the
fall
season
and
the
plant
was
closed
down.
now
of
course,
when
the
merger
took
place
between
the
two
railroads,
there
was
a
merger,
if
you
will
of
the
unions
involved.
the
employees
were
members
of
local
826
system
federation
78,
counsel
2.
now,
they
were
stationary
engineers
and
they
supplied
the
steam
to
provide
heat
for
the
power
plant
and
also
provided
heat
for
the
trains
as
they
come
in
for
the
station.
erie
railroad
built
a
new
station,
a
new
plant
in
the
city
of
buffalo.
these
four
men,
the
respondent
employees
here
as
station
engineers
were
not
called
back
to
work.
their
jobs
were
replaced
by
four
former
employees
of
the
erie
railroad
and
these
four
former
employees
of
the
erie
railroad
were
not
stationary
engineers
but
they
were
laborers.
and
it
was
the
contention
of
the
employees
and
they
had
made
this
know
through
again,
this
is
after
--
this
is
not
in
the
record
but
i
feel
like
we
have
to
bring
it
to
the
court's
attention
with
the
court's
permission.
they
brought
this
situation
to
the
attention
of
the
master
mechanic
for
the
railroad
and
the
union
representative.
the
answer
that
they
received
from
both
parties
was
that
the
--
they
were
not
affected
employees
with
respect
to
the
merger,
that
the
reason
that
they
lost
their
jobs
or
to
use
the
word
furlough
as
the
other
counsel
used
it,
was
because
of
the
obsolescence
of
this
michigan
avenue
power
plant.
now,
in
the
lower
courts
and
the
district
court
and
then
the
court
of
appeals,
both
the
attorneys
for
the
union
and
the
attorneys
for
the
railroad
indicated
that
these
men
have
not
lost
their
jobs,
that
they
were
just
furloughed.
of
course
this
is
almost
8
years
later
and
they
still
called
it
a
furlough,
they
don't
call
it
a
wrongful
discharge.
they
did
bring
these
--
they
brought
this
attention
of
the
situation
to
the
master
mechanic
and
the
union
representative
as
i
indicated
before,
they
got
the
same
answer.
and
was
written
to
the
president
of
the
union
and
he
said
that
the
reason
that
you
were
given
before
by
the
general
chairman
of
the
local
counsel
was
the
sufficient
reason
as
to
why
you
do
not
have
your
job,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
there
were
no
forms
given
to
the
employees
here
as
to
start
any
kind
of
action
before
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board,
nothing
of
this
sort,
nothing
was
done
at
all.
action
was
commenced
in
the
western
district
of
new
york.
a
complaint
was
filed
and
summonses
were
served
on
certain
of
the
defendants.
it's
the
major
contention
of
the
employees
here
that
this
is
a
fair
representation
case
against
the
union
and
that
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
under
no
decisions
that
i
know
of
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
an
unfair
representation
claim
against
the
union
alone.
my
reading
of
cases
in
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
new
york,
particularly
the
cunningham
case
indicates
that
when
a
plaintiff
has
a
claim
against
the
union
for
unfair
representation
and
also
connected
with
that
would
have
a
wrongful
discharge
claim
against
the
company
that
a
better
practice
is
not
to
disassociate
the
claims
and
make
the
plaintiff
seek
their
relief
in
two
different
areas
of
law
as
it
were
but
to
let
the
employee
plaintiff
sue
both
people
in
the
federal
district
court
and
it
is
my
understanding
of
the
cunningham
case
as
that
what
was
done.
judge
medina
indicated
that
in
a
closely
integrated
action
that
this
is
the
better
practice
and
this
is
what
should
be
done
and
this
is
what
i
argued
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york.
as
to
the
argument
of
mr.
lyman,
relative
to
the
company,
the
railroad
should
not
be
led
off,
i
agree
but
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
left
the
employees
with
and
out
as
it
were
because
they
allowed
us
to
amend
our
complaint
if
we
could
against
the
union,
against
the
company,
excuse
me,
alleging
that
if
it
wasn't
--
not
collusion
but
at
least
some
kind
of
test
that's
understanding
between
the
two
defendants
as
to
these
job
replacements.
because,
again,
this
is
not
in
the
record
but
the
employees
would
attempt
to
prove
that
there
was
some
kind
of
an
agreement
between
the
company
and
the
union
as
represented
by
stronger
people
from
the
former
erie
railroad
that
there
was
some
kind
of
agreement
as
to
these
four
jobs.
mr.
james
p.
shea
wrongful
discharge?
mr.
james
p.
shea
well,
as
i
understand
the
cunningham
case
that
as
the
posture,
the
case
was
tried
on
mr.
justice
white,
a
wrongful
discharge
along
with
the
fair
representation.
mr.
james
p.
shea
right.
mr.
james
p.
shea
that's
my
understanding
of
the
law
also.
mr.
james
p.
shea
well,
that
would
be
the
first
time
that
the
railroad
is
subject
then
because
there
is
no
allegation
before
that,
they
could
have
brought
it
to
the
board.
again,
then
you
come
to
the
problem
as
the
same
factual
set
of
circumstances
that
employees
would
i
say
be
forced
to
go
into
two
different
forms
to
litigate
the
one
question,
really
the
one
question.
mr.
james
p.
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
james
p.
shea
no.
mr.
james
p.
shea
correct
your
honor.
and
employees
are
suing,
they
are
not
suing
for
loss
of
seniority
rights
or
anything
like
that.
we
accept
the
furlough
or
discharge,
whatever
you
want
to
call,
its
final
and
we're
just
pursuing
along
those
remedies.
there
is
no
other
minor
dispute
category
involved.
mr.
james
p.
shea
they
want
retribution
as
far
as
money
--
monetary
damages
are
concerned
here.
there
has
been
no
offer
of
severance
pay
or
anything
like
that.
mr.
james
p.
shea
i
am
not
sure
if
i
do
win
the
case
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
james
p.
shea
before
the
board
you
mean?
mr.
james
p.
shea
no.
mr.
james
p.
shea
that's
correct,
it
did
not.
mr.
james
p.
shea
that's
true
your
honor,
i
could.
mr.
james
p.
shea
even
more
than
that
--
mr.
james
p.
shea
even
more
than
that
mr.
justice
brennan
because
the
--
of
course
the
discharge
was
precipitated
by
the
company.
mr.
james
p.
shea
would
certainly
be
an
evidentiary
problem
that
district
court
to
do
that.
mr.
james
p.
shea
no,
because
in
a
pure
sense,
the
union
couldn't
cause
it
--
mr.
james
p.
shea
right,
at
least
collusion
on
part
of
the
union
with
the
railroad,
to
cause
the
loss
of
employment
by
the
employees
here.
as
far
as
the
--
mr.
james
p.
shea
yes,
it's
my
understanding
--
mr.
james
p.
shea
correct,
we
are
not
asking
for
reinstatement.
mr.
james
p.
shea
then
these
employees
are
out
of
the
picture
as
far
as
the
railroad
is
concerned.
mr.
james
p.
shea
i
just
said,
as
far
as
the
railroad
is
concerned.
but
--
mr.
james
p.
shea
the
case
against
the
union,
it's
my
understanding,
we're
still
allowed
to
sue
the
union
but
again
it's
a
practical
problem,
it's
an
evidentiary
problem
as
far
as
these
employees
are
concerned.
why
disjoint
the
case
when
it's
a
closely
integrated
problem
and
allow
the
plaintiffs
to
go
into
a
federal
district
court
at
least
expense
to
them
and
--
mr.
james
p.
shea
well,
that's
the
reason
i
didn't
want
to
go
to
the
board
naturally
because
the
board
is
comprised
of
members
of
the
union
and
the
company.
when
you're
alleged
in
a
complaint
such
as
this
that
there
was
some
kind
of
--
conspiracy
is
kind
of
a
bad
word
but
some
kind
of
collusion
anyways
against
the
employees
by
both
sides
as
this
court
indicated
in
glover
although
that
was
a
racial
discrimination
case,
i
really
don't
see
too
much
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
glover
case
as
far
as
allowing
these
employees
to
go
into
a
district
court
and
not
to
disassociate.
mr.
james
p.
shea
i
could
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
shea
which
is
very
important
in
this
case,
the
statute
of
limitations
because
of
course
it
lays
a
point
over
the
court,
it's
almost
8
years
old
is
the
case
now
and
my
understanding
of
the
procedure
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
that's
quite
time
consuming
there
as
far
as
getting
before
the
board
and
getting
a
decision.
essentially,
that's
the
position
of
the
employees
of
this
case
and
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
james
p.
shea
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
would
appear
that
the
chief
thrust
of
the
petitioner's
argument
of
course
is
against
the
sufficiency
of
the
claims.
with
that
in
mind
to
be
very
candid
to
the
court,
the
employee
respondents
here
rely
on
this
court's
prior
decision
in
conley
versus
gibson.
and
on
page
7
of
our
brief,
we
quote
“what
we
believe
to

the

”
now,
with
this
in
mind,
this
is
why
i
argued
before
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
outside
the
record
because
there
just
isn't
any
record
here
outside
the
complaint
and
the
affidavits
of
counsel.
and
the
reason
i
did
argue
to
the
second
court
of
appeals
as
to
what
i
believe
is
the
factual
background
and
which
has
not
been
disputed
as
far
as
i
know
by
any
of
the
counsel
here
as
to
the
factual
background
which
underlies
the
complaint
in
this
case.
now,
the
respondent
employees
were
four
former
members
of
the
delaware
lackawanna
&
western
railroad
that
had
varying
periods
of
the
service
with
that
railroad
ranging
from
47
years
to
9
years.
of
course
the
merger
took
place
in
1960
and
these
men
were
employed
as
stationary
engineers
in
the
city
of
buffalo
what
was
known
as
the
michigan
avenue
power
plant.
they
were
laid
off
during
the
summer
which
was
the
usual
procedure
with
the
company.
they
were
not
called
back
to
work
for
the
fall
season
and
the
plant
was
closed
down.
now
of
course,
when
the
merger
took
place
between
the
two
railroads,
there
was
a
merger,
if
you
will
of
the
unions
involved.
the
employees
were
members
of
local
826
system
federation
78,
counsel
2.
now,
they
were
stationary
engineers
and
they
supplied
the
steam
to
provide
heat
for
the
power
plant
and
also
provided
heat
for
the
trains
as
they
come
in
for
the
station.
erie
railroad
built
a
new
station,
a
new
plant
in
the
city
of
buffalo.
these
four
men,
the
respondent
employees
here
as
station
engineers
were
not
called
back
to
work.
their
jobs
were
replaced
by
four
former
employees
of
the
erie
railroad
and
these
four
former
employees
of
the
erie
railroad
were
not
stationary
engineers
but
they
were
laborers.
and
it
was
the
contention
of
the
employees
and
they
had
made
this
know
through
again,
this
is
after
--
this
is
not
in
the
record
but
i
feel
like
we
have
to
bring
it
to
the
court's
attention
with
the
court's
permission.
they
brought
this
situation
to
the
attention
of
the
master
mechanic
for
the
railroad
and
the
union
representative.
the
answer
that
they
received
from
both
parties
was
that
the
--
they
were
not
affected
employees
with
respect
to
the
merger,
that
the
reason
that
they
lost
their
jobs
or
to
use
the
word
furlough
as
the
other
counsel
used
it,
was
because
of
the
obsolescence
of
this
michigan
avenue
power
plant.
now,
in
the
lower
courts
and
the
district
court
and
then
the
court
of
appeals,
both
the
attorneys
for
the
union
and
the
attorneys
for
the
railroad
indicated
that
these
men
have
not
lost
their
jobs,
that
they
were
just
furloughed.
of
course
this
is
almost
8
years
later
and
they
still
called
it
a
furlough,
they
don't
call
it
a
wrongful
discharge.
they
did
bring
these
--
they
brought
this
attention
of
the
situation
to
the
master
mechanic
and
the
union
representative
as
i
indicated
before,
they
got
the
same
answer.
and
was
written
to
the
president
of
the
union
and
he
said
that
the
reason
that
you
were
given
before
by
the
general
chairman
of
the
local
counsel
was
the
sufficient
reason
as
to
why
you
do
not
have
your
job,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
there
were
no
forms
given
to
the
employees
here
as
to
start
any
kind
of
action
before
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board,
nothing
of
this
sort,
nothing
was
done
at
all.
action
was
commenced
in
the
western
district
of
new
york.
a
complaint
was
filed
and
summonses
were
served
on
certain
of
the
defendants.
it's
the
major
contention
of
the
employees
here
that
this
is
a
fair
representation
case
against
the
union
and
that
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
under
no
decisions
that
i
know
of
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
an
unfair
representation
claim
against
the
union
alone.
my
reading
of
cases
in
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
new
york,
particularly
the
cunningham
case
indicates
that
when
a
plaintiff
has
a
claim
against
the
union
for
unfair
representation
and
also
connected
with
that
would
have
a
wrongful
discharge
claim
against
the
company
that
a
better
practice
is
not
to
disassociate
the
claims
and
make
the
plaintiff
seek
their
relief
in
two
different
areas
of
law
as
it
were
but
to
let
the
employee
plaintiff
sue
both
people
in
the
federal
district
court
and
it
is
my
understanding
of
the
cunningham
case
as
that
what
was
done.
judge
medina
indicated
that
in
a
closely
integrated
action
that
this
is
the
better
practice
and
this
is
what
should
be
done
and
this
is
what
i
argued
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york.
as
to
the
argument
of
mr.
lyman,
relative
to
the
company,
the
railroad
should
not
be
led
off,
i
agree
but
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
left
the
employees
with
and
out
as
it
were
because
they
allowed
us
to
amend
our
complaint
if
we
could
against
the
union,
against
the
company,
excuse
me,
alleging
that
if
it
wasn't
--
not
collusion
but
at
least
some
kind
of
test
that's
understanding
between
the
two
defendants
as
to
these
job
replacements.
because,
again,
this
is
not
in
the
record
but
the
employees
would
attempt
to
prove
that
there
was
some
kind
of
an
agreement
between
the
company
and
the
union
as
represented
by
stronger
people
from
the
former
erie
railroad
that
there
was
some
kind
of
agreement
as
to
these
four
jobs.
mr.
james
p.
shea
wrongful
discharge?
mr.
james
p.
shea
well,
as
i
understand
the
cunningham
case
that
as
the
posture,
the
case
was
tried
on
mr.
justice
white,
a
wrongful
discharge
along
with
the
fair
representation.
mr.
james
p.
shea
right.
mr.
james
p.
shea
that's
my
understanding
of
the
law
also.
mr.
james
p.
shea
well,
that
would
be
the
first
time
that
the
railroad
is
subject
then
because
there
is
no
allegation
before
that,
they
could
have
brought
it
to
the
board.
again,
then
you
come
to
the
problem
as
the
same
factual
set
of
circumstances
that
employees
would
i
say
be
forced
to
go
into
two
different
forms
to
litigate
the
one
question,
really
the
one
question.
mr.
james
p.
shea
yes
sir.
mr.
james
p.
shea
no.
mr.
james
p.
shea
correct
your
honor.
and
employees
are
suing,
they
are
not
suing
for
loss
of
seniority
rights
or
anything
like
that.
we
accept
the
furlough
or
discharge,
whatever
you
want
to
call,
its
final
and
we're
just
pursuing
along
those
remedies.
there
is
no
other
minor
dispute
category
involved.
mr.
james
p.
shea
they
want
retribution
as
far
as
money
--
monetary
damages
are
concerned
here.
there
has
been
no
offer
of
severance
pay
or
anything
like
that.
mr.
james
p.
shea
i
am
not
sure
if
i
do
win
the
case
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
james
p.
shea
before
the
board
you
mean?
mr.
james
p.
shea
no.
mr.
james
p.
shea
that's
correct,
it
did
not.
mr.
james
p.
shea
that's
true
your
honor,
i
could.
mr.
james
p.
shea
even
more
than
that
--
mr.
james
p.
shea
even
more
than
that
mr.
justice
brennan
because
the
--
of
course
the
discharge
was
precipitated
by
the
company.
mr.
james
p.
shea
would
certainly
be
an
evidentiary
problem
that
district
court
to
do
that.
mr.
james
p.
shea
no,
because
in
a
pure
sense,
the
union
couldn't
cause
it
--
mr.
james
p.
shea
right,
at
least
collusion
on
part
of
the
union
with
the
railroad,
to
cause
the
loss
of
employment
by
the
employees
here.
as
far
as
the
--
mr.
james
p.
shea
yes,
it's
my
understanding
--
mr.
james
p.
shea
correct,
we
are
not
asking
for
reinstatement.
mr.
james
p.
shea
then
these
employees
are
out
of
the
picture
as
far
as
the
railroad
is
concerned.
mr.
james
p.
shea
i
just
said,
as
far
as
the
railroad
is
concerned.
but
--
mr.
james
p.
shea
the
case
against
the
union,
it's
my
understanding,
we're
still
allowed
to
sue
the
union
but
again
it's
a
practical
problem,
it's
an
evidentiary
problem
as
far
as
these
employees
are
concerned.
why
disjoint
the
case
when
it's
a
closely
integrated
problem
and
allow
the
plaintiffs
to
go
into
a
federal
district
court
at
least
expense
to
them
and
--
mr.
james
p.
shea
well,
that's
the
reason
i
didn't
want
to
go
to
the
board
naturally
because
the
board
is
comprised
of
members
of
the
union
and
the
company.
when
you're
alleged
in
a
complaint
such
as
this
that
there
was
some
kind
of
--
conspiracy
is
kind
of
a
bad
word
but
some
kind
of
collusion
anyways
against
the
employees
by
both
sides
as
this
court
indicated
in
glover
although
that
was
a
racial
discrimination
case,
i
really
don't
see
too
much
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
glover
case
as
far
as
allowing
these
employees
to
go
into
a
district
court
and
not
to
disassociate.
mr.
james
p.
shea
i
could
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
shea
which
is
very
important
in
this
case,
the
statute
of
limitations
because
of
course
it
lays
a
point
over
the
court,
it's
almost
8
years
old
is
the
case
now
and
my
understanding
of
the
procedure
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
that's
quite
time
consuming
there
as
far
as
getting
before
the
board
and
getting
a
decision.
essentially,
that's
the
position
of
the
employees
of
this
case
and
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
