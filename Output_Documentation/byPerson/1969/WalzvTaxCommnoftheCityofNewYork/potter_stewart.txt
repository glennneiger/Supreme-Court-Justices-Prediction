mr.

before
you
proceed
with
your
argument,
i'm
a
little
curious
about
the
whereabouts

this
case.
i
refer
particularly
to
vi
of
the
appendix
of
the
amicus
brief
of
mrs.
madelyn
murray
o'hare,
in
which
it's
indicated
that
the
post
office
couldn't
find
mr.
walz.
justice
potter
stewart
did
somebody
else
sign
for
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
--

i
wonder
if
he
still--
justice
potter
stewart
that
satisfies
my
question,
i
just
wondered
if
he
was
still
around.
