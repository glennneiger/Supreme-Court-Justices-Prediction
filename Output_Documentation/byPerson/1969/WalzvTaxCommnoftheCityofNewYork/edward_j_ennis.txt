mr.
edward
j.
ennis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
final
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york,
affirming
an
order
for
summary
judgment
obtained
by
the
defendant,
dismissing
the
complaint
which
asserts
that
the
plaintiff,
appellant
here,
is
a
citizen
and
a
real
estate
taxpayer,
who
sought
in
adjudication
that
the
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions
of
the
state
in
new
york,
which
exempt
from
real
estate
taxation
all
the
property
of
religious
corporations
used
solely
for
religious
purposes
violates
the
first
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
he
asserts
in
his
complaint
that
he's
a
christian
not
a
member
of
any
particular
sect,
and
objects
that
the
amount
by
which
his
taxes,
his
real
estate
taxes
are
increased
by
the
exemption
of
all
religiously
owned
property
for
use
of
religious
purposes
from
taxations,
constitutes
an
involuntary
contribution
by
him
to
the
activities
of
these
religious
organizations
which
violates
his
freedom
of
religion.
before
taking
up
my
main
argument
which
will
be
very
brief
because
the
principle
that
i
assert
is
very
simple,
i
would
like
to
address
one
word
to
corporation
counsel's
suggestion
in
the
first
point
of
his
brief
that
the
court
should
either
dismiss
or
affirm
this
appeal
on
the
ground
that
the
record
is
inadequate.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
all
of
the
facts
required
for
a
decision
of
this
issue
no
matter
how
momentous
it
maybe,
are
present
either
in
the
pleadings
or
in
the
facts
which
are
judicial
notice.
it
was
the
defendant
who
moved
for
summary
judgment
and
the
facts
were
quite
sufficient
to
obtain
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
and
the
defendant
is
not
in
a
good
position
here
to
assert
that
the
facts
are
not
sufficient
for
review
by
this
court.
the
--
all
of
the
facts
required
for
decision
are
present.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
well
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
well,
let
me
tell
you
what
i
know.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
mr.
walz
is
a
member
of
the
new
york
bar,
and
he's
taken
the
case
to
this
stage
and
intended
to
argue
the
case.
he
requested
me
to
argue
it
and
present
his
position
in
his
behalf
because
he
happens
to
be
suffering
from
a
very
high
blood
pressure
and
frankly,
he
stated
that
he
did
not
think
that
he
emotionally
could
undertake
the
responsibility
to
present
the
oral
argument
to
this
court.
i've
known
mr.
--
i
know
mr.
walz,
he's
been
in
my
office
several
times
and
i
can
communicate
with
him
anytime
i
wish.
i
mean
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
and
now,
going
to
the
merits
of
the
argument,
i
do
not
intend
to
quote
to
this
court
much
of
what
had
it
said
in
the
over
500
pages
that
the
court
has
written
between
gobitis
and
flast
on
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
the
first
amendment.
i
think
it
appropriate
however
that
we
approach
our
argument
with
the
statement
made
by
mr.
justice
jackson
speaking
for
the
court
in
the
barnett
case
which
established
that
this
flag
salute
have
violated
the
first
amendment.
now
mr.
justice
jackson
for
the
court
stated
that
the
task
of
translating
the
majestic
generalities
of
the
bill
of
rights
conceived
as
part
of
the
pattern
of
liberal
government
in
the
18th
century
into
concrete
restraints
on
officials
dealing
with
problems
of
the
20th
century
is
one
to
disturb
the
self
confidence.
these
changed
conditions
from
the
laissez
faire
situation
in
the
18th
century
for
the
government
control
of
our
century,
often
deprived
precedence
of
reliability
and
cast
us
more
than
we
would
choose
on
our
own
judgment,
but
we
act
in
these
matters
not
by
authority
of
our
confidence,
but
by
force
of
our
commissions.
we
cannot
because
of
modest
testaments
of
our
confidence
in
such
specialties
as
public
education
withhold
the
judgment
that
history
authenticates
as
the
function
of
this
court
when
liberty
is
infringed.
approaching
this
question,
it
is
the
appellant's
submission
that
the
plain
words,
the
first
ten
words
of
the
first
amendment
of
the
bill
of
rights
that
congress,
which
now
includes
the
states,
shall
pass
no
law
respecting
the
establishment
of
religion
bars
all
age
religion
including
the
massive
tax
exemption
from
real
estate
taxes
presented
in
this
case.
i
will
not
pause
to
lead
the
court
again
as
it
has
gone
through
its
opinions
through
the
course
in
the
first
congress
which
produced
these
general
words
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion.
it
is
suffice
to
say
that
out
of
the
narrower
words
introduced
into
the
house,
no
law
establishing
religion
and
out
of
the
still
narrow
words
introduced
into
the
senate,
no
law
establishing
articles
of
faith.
in
the
conference
between
the
two
houses,
in
which
mr.
madison
was
a
member
of
the
conference,
we
extracted
the
words
no
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
which
the
congress
adopted
and
the
states
adopted.
now,
this
court
has
said
in
everson
and
in
every
case
considered
since
everson
that
the
generalities
of
these
words
not
only
prohibit
the
establishment
of
a
church,
but
they
prohibit
any
aid
to
religion.
only
two
words
--
only
two
sentences
from
the
court's
opinion
in
everson
which
has
been
quoted
by
the
court
in
every
opinion
since.
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment
means
at
least
this,
“neither
a
state
nor
the
federal
government
can
set
up
a
church,
neither
can
pass
laws
which
aid
one
religion,
aid
all
religions
or
prefer
one
religion
over
another.”
the
appellant's
position
very
simply
is
that
just
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated
and
indeed
in
the
last
case
in
the
flast
case,
that
of
course
the
first
amendment
forbids
aid
to
religion
and
that
any
tax
funds
that
any
taxes
be
exacted
or
spent
on
religion.
that
it's
the
appellant's
submission
that
this
exemption
from
real
estate
taxes
is
precisely
the
same
as
if
the
state
of
new
york
had
passed
a
law
stating
that
all
religious
property
shall
be
valued,
so
that
at
least
we
might
know
its
valuation
and
its
increasing
valuation,
and
shall
be
taxed
like
all
other
property.
but
that
upon
application
by
the
taxpayer,
disclosing
that
it
is
a
religious
organization
and
that
the
property
is
used
solely
for
religious
purposes,
these
taxes
should
be
refunded.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
exemption
before
us
is
no
different,
and
that
if
this
court
would
strike
down
the
hypothetical
statute
i've
suggested,
it
should
strike
down
the
exemption
statute
of
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
no,
your
honor,
the
statute
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
of
course,
if
the
religious
corporation
is
in
the
general
provisions
which
exempts
educational
institutions,
hospitals
and
the
like,
and
it
includes
religious
corporations.
we
of
course
submit
your
honor,
i'll
have
a
word
to
say
about
the
suggestion
that
religion
can
be
subsumed
under
charitable
activities,
but
it
is
so
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned,
included
with
these
other
classifications.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
oh,
no,
no
of
course
not
your
honor.
the
hospitals,
the
asylums,
the
orphanages,
the
educational
institutions,
schools,
all
of
these
institutions
which
are
run
by
religious
organizations
are
exempt
from
real
estate
taxes
by
virtue
of
their
function.
our
argument
only
reaches
to
property
used
exclusively
for
religious
purposes.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
no,
no
it
does
not
at
all
your
honor.
but
the
statute
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
i
have
no
trouble
in
exempting
the
real
estate
from
taxation.
and
in
any
event,
your
honor,
the
statute
relieves
us
from
this
problem
because
the
statute
we're
addressing
ourself
to
exempts
only
property
which
is
used
exclusively
for
religious
purposes.
now,
we
do
not
have
to
address
ourselves
to
what
might
be
a
more
difficult
problem
as
is
to
whether
a
hospital
run
by
a
church
institution,
whether
physical
care
is
sufficiently
permeated
with
religious
instruction
to
render
it
suspect.
we
don't
have
to
deal
with
that.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
the
--
i
--
i
think
that
the
constitution
does
not
forbid
the
legislature
to
grant
exemptions
to
charitable
organizations,
but
only
to
religious
organizations.
it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
that
if
prayer
and
bible
reading
in
the
public
school
is
an
aid
to
religion,
it's
inescapable
that
the
practical
economic
financial
aid
of
real
estate
tax
exemption
is
an
aid
to
religion.
this
proposition
is
so
simple
that
it
is
rather
difficult
to
expand
upon
it.
its
very
statement
is
its
own
proof.
unless
this
court
is
prepared
to
say
that
factually
an
exemption
of
pure
property
use
purely
for
religious
purposes
is
not
an
aid
to
religion,
unless
the
court
is
prepared
to
say
that
it
must
say
that
is
an
aid
to
religion
which
is
unconstitutional.
i
think
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
defenses,
if
i
may
call
it
that
or
the
arguments
which
the
corporation
counsel
has
presented
in
his
brief
on
this
subject.
and
these
are
the
defenses
presented
usually
to
support
this
awkward
fact
that
we
have
in
all
of
the
states,
this
exemption,
and
although
we've
had
it
in
all
of
the
states
for
180
years,
it
now
for
the
first
time
comes
squarely
before
this
court
for
consideration.
the
first
argument
in
support
of
it
is
the
argument
of
history.
how
is
it
that
this
exemption
stands
on
the
books
of
all
the
states
for
so
long
without
having
been
challenged
in
this
court?
of
course,
the
answer
i
think
is
a
tribute
to
the
great
political
power
of
the
religious
organizations
in
this
country
that
have
been
able
to
achieve
that
this
exemption
from
taxes
for
so
long.
another
reason
is
that
when
this
started
in
the
beginning
of
our
republic,
the
tax
question
was
a
very
minor
one.
the
tax
question
has
only
loomed
large
when
in
part
as
a
result
of
tax
exemption,
religious
organizations
in
this
country
have
accumulated
literally
hundreds
of
billions
dollars
of
property.
and
now,
with
the
increasing
public
services,
social
services
that
are
required,
the
matter
becomes
acute
as
to
whether
this
isn't
part
of
the
real
estate
in
the
united
states
which
constitutionally
should
be
subject
to
tax.
and
indeed,
another
simple
argument
is
that
history
cannot
turn
aid
into
no
aid
not
only
real
estate
tax
exemption,
but
it's
been
common
in
our
public
schools
saying
public
prayers
and
bible
reading.
this
has
gone
on
since
the
beginning
of
the
republic,
but
it
only
reached
this
court
in
the
last
20
years
when
citizens
determined
to
raise
the
issue.
take
the
sunday
store
laws.
the
sunday
store
laws,
as
this
court
in
it
cases
--
in
its
decision
recognizes
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
this
of
course
had
a
religious
origin
and
yet,
they
went
on
with
this
religious
justification,
legislative
justification
was
religious,
they
went
on
from
the
beginning
of
the
republic
until
a
few
years
ago
and
the
court
in
its
opinion
stated
“we
would
strike
these
sunday
laws
down
as
unconstitutional
establishment
of
religion.”
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
in
the
development
of
our
country,
a
secular
reason
for
these
laws
has
supplanted
the
original
religious
purpose
of
the
laws.
and
the
court
said
that
“if
the
purpose
was
aid
to
religion,
these
sunday
laws
would've
been
stricken
down
and
they
were
saved
because
the
purpose
has
become
secular.”
now,
--
but
it's
only
as
our
country
developed
and
people
wanted
to
open
up
stores
on
sunday,
the
stores
that
were
involved
that
the
question
was
presented
to
this
court,
despite
that
fact
that
it
was
in
its
origins
unconstitutional,
although
not
tested.
i
think
that
this
takes
care
of
the
argument
from
history
to
the
extent
that
it
can
be
taken
care
of.
i
do
not
mean
to
blink
at
the
point
that
a
practice
which
has
existed
for
so
long,
it
carries
with
it
a
certain
historical
momentum
of
its
own.
but
this
court
is
no
stranger
to
striking
down
laws
as
unconstitutional
which
the
american
people
have
accepted
for
a
long
periods
of
time,
until
the
time
comes
when
a
citizen
properly
raises
the
question,
as
i
believe
mr.
walz
has
done,
and
requires
that
these
laws
be
stricken
down.
now,
the
second
point
that
mr.
rankin
makes,
and
it
also
has
its
interest,
is
that
the
exemption
really
supports
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
which
was
to
prevent
strike
between
the
religion
and
the
secular
state
that
leaving
the
state
alone
in
this
respect
promotes
that
neutrality
which
was
one
purpose
of
the
first
amendment.
if
the
court
please,
my
answer
to
that
is
that
taxing
real
estate
used
for
religious
purposes,
like
other
real
estate,
is
just
as
neutral
as
not
taxing
it.
there
is
no
--
there
is
not
intended
by
this
to
promote
any
conflict
with
the
church,
and
i
cannot
see
how
it
will
produce
a
conflict
with
the
church
to
treat
such
property
as
all
other
real
estate
is
treated.
now,
the
third
argument
that
mr.
rankin
refers
to
in
his
brief
is
also
a
common
one.
that
what
the
legislatures
have
done
have
considered
religion
like
other
charities
which
it
exempts.
that
it
is
true
of
course
that
religion
until
the
more
recent
period
of
our
history,
took
up
the
burden
of
charity.
the
alms
houses,
the
hospitals,
the
orphanages,
the
old
peoples
homes,
all
of
these
in
earlier
days
was
largely
left
to
religious
private
activity.
this
of
course
is
no
longer
the
case
and
it
explains,
i
think,
why
the
legislatures
have
placed
religious
activities
into
the
same
statutory
framework
as
other
charitable
activities,
but
it
cannot
satisfy
the
constitutional
requirement
that
both
the
congress
and
all
of
the
legislatures
are
expressly
prohibited
from
treating
religion
like
other
charitable
activities.
the
states
and
congress
are
prohibited
from
this.
now,
another
answer
is
that
the
prayer
which
this
--
the
prayer
of
the
public
schools
and
the
bible
reading
in
the
public
schools
which
this
court
has
stricken
down
as
unconstitutional,
that
promotes
moral
values,
just
as
religious
activity
promotes
moral
values,
but
just
as
--
that
is
not
a
sufficient
basis
to
save
the
prayer
the
fact
that
it
promotes
a
secular
object,
if
you
will,
namely
moral
considerations,
if
it
is
not
enough
to
save
that
the
prayer,
it
is
not
enough
to
save
the
tax
exemption.
now,
the
last
argument
that's
made
on
this
point
by
mr.
rankin
is
that
this
court
has
approved
other
exemptions.
for
example,
the
selective
service
exemption
where
the
court
excuses
ministers
or
rather
the
statute
excuses
ministers
and
conscientious
objectors
and
the
sunday
laws,
not
the
ones
that
the
court
struck
down,
but
those
laws
in
which
a
state
has
chosen
to
give
an
exemption
for
the
two
people
who
observed
the
sabbath
and
let
them
run
their
business
on
sunday.
the
distinction,
we
submit,
is
that
the
power
of
the
congress
in
the
interest
of
national
defense
and
general
welfare,
it
doesn't
have
to
give
those
exemptions.
it
did
give
them
out
of
respect
for
acts
of
conscience
for
religious
conscience,
but
it's
not
been
suggested
by
the
christian
churches
that
the
payment
of
real
estate
taxes
would
offend
their
freedom
of
religion
in
the
sense
of
their
freedom
of
conscience.
surely,
a
church
which
recognizes
that
caesar
shall
have
what
is
his
and
god
shall
have
what
is
his
would
not
make
the
argument
that
to
pay
real
estate
taxes
would
violate
their
conscientious
group.
they
merely
asked
to
be
exempt
for
the
payment
of
taxes,
and
i
think
this
is
a
great
distinction
between
these
cases.
now,
i'm
going
to
address
myself
in
just
very
briefly
to
an
argument
that
is
not
made
by
the
city
of
new
york
and
that
is
that
this
statute
is
required
by
the
free
exercise
clause.
that
argument
is
made
in
the
brief
of
the
national
counsel
of
the
churches
of
christ
in
the
united
states
of
america
by
mr.
tuttle,
who's
here
today
to
hear
the
argument.
now,
mr.
tuttle
relies
for
that
contention
that
these
laws
are
not
only
permissible
but
are
required
on
the
murdock
case
and
the
fallet
case.
now,
as
your
honors
will
recall
in
murdock,
the
court
stated
that
you
could
not
place
a
license
tax
on
the
very
activity
of
distributing
religious
literature
by
members
of
a
religious
sect
whose
--
the
essence
of
their
religious
activity
was
going
from
house
to
house,
distributing
and
selling
their
literature.
but
as
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
that
case,
this
is
quite
different
from
the
tax
on
property
used
for
religious
activities.
it
is
one
think
to
tax
a
preacher's
property
and
another
thing
to
tax
his
teaching.
we
say
that
there's
a
very
obvious
distinction
between
the
direct
tax
upon
the
religious
activity
involved
in
the
murdock
case
and
the
tax
on
the
land
and
the
wooden
stones
which
constitute
the
property
of
the
real
estate
tax
of
religious
property.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes,
my
point
is
your
honor
that
this
court
in
the
murdock
and
fallet
case
that
followed
it,
in
stating
that
attacks
directly
upon
the
activity
was
unconstitutional
because
it
did
limit
the
free
exercise
religion
that
mr.
justice
douglas
for
the
court,
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
his
concurring
opinion
expressly
distinguished
that
tax
from
the
tax
that
we
have
here.
for
example,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
in
very
plain
words,
“it
is
alien
to
our
constitutional
system
to
suggest
that
it
exempts
church
held
lands
from
state
taxation.”
in
other
words,
the
court
itself
has
very
plainly
made
the
distinction
from
the
direct
exercise
of
religion
not
subject
to
a
license
task,
and
indeed,
i
hardly
have
to
go
further
and
state
that
if
this
argument
were
true,
would
it
mean
that
the
great
real
estate
holdings
of
our
press
and
our
t.v.
organization
should
not
be
subject
to
tax
because
they
are
engaged
in
the
exercise
of
the
freedom
of
the
press?
it's
hardly
distinguishable.
the
land
used
by
the
new
york
times
to
print
its
paper
is
just
as
much
involved
in
the
freedom
of
the
press
as
the
church
building
used
in
expressing
religion.
now,
i
would
like
to
close
my
argument,
if
the
court
please,
by
a
one
sentence
statement
from
james
madison,
whom
this
court
has
recognized
in
many
opinions
as
the
very
architect
of
the
first
amendment.
when
he'd
retired
as
president
to
montpeller,
i
had
a
chance
to
review
all
he
had
done
and
the
attention
he'd
given
to
this
important
question
of
establishment
of
religion.
in
his
detached
memorandum,
which
i
hope
your
honors
will
again
read
because
he
has
the
fervor
and
eloquence
on
this
matter
which
i
can
not
match.
he
indeed
even
goes
so
far
in
the
detached
memorandum
as
to
say
that
the
chaplains
in
the
congress
and
in
the
army
and
navy
are
establishments
of
religion,
and
should
not
be
allowed.
and
he
concludes,
as
i
will
conclude
my
argument
with
one
sentence,
he
says
“it
is
safer
to
adhere
to
a
right
principle
and
trust
its
consequences
than
to
confide
in
reasoning
however
specious
in
fear
--
in
reliance
upon
a
wrong
one.”
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
the
exemption
of
churches
is
aid
to
religion
and
is
barred
by
the
first
amendment.
these
various
arguments
which
have
been
made
to
attempt
to
excuse
it
do
not
excuse
it,
and
are
form
of
specious
reasoning
which
the
court
or
should
not
accept,
which
should
hold
as
simple
logic
and
the
words
of
the
constitution
require
that
an
exemption
is
as
much
an
aid
to
religion
as
if
the
taxes
were
collected
and
returned
upon
application.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
i'd
like
to
make
just
two
statements
if
it
pleases
the
court.
one
that
the
corporation
counsel
has
gone
outside
the
record
to
tell
the
court
some
knowledge
he
has
about
the
value
of
mr.
walz's
property
and
how
much
his
taxes
were.
i
don't
have
that
information
and
in
the
affidavit,
a
five-page
affidavit
in
support
of
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
city
of
new
york
which
could've
easily
have
the
information
available
about
the
value
of
that
property
did
not
choose
to
make
that
point.
i
don't
think
that
should
be
taken
into
account.
and
about
this
specter
that
the
corporation
counsel
raises
that
if
we
have
to
value
the
property
of
churches
for
real
estate
tax
purposes
there
is
going
to
be
a
lot
of
certiorari
proceedings
in
the
like.
very
well,
one
of
the
socially
undesirable
factors
in
the
exemption
of
church
property
is
we
don't
have
any
idea
of
what
the
value
of
such
property
is,
and
there's
no
reason
we
shouldn't.
it's
not
true
to
suggest
that
knowledge
is
un-neutral
or
hostile,
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
we
know
the
value
of
the
--
increasing
value
of
the
property
of
religious
organizations
in
the
united
states,
why
not?
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
final
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york,
affirming
an
order
for
summary
judgment
obtained
by
the
defendant,
dismissing
the
complaint
which
asserts
that
the
plaintiff,
appellant
here,
is
a
citizen
and
a
real
estate
taxpayer,
who
sought
in
adjudication
that
the
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions
of
the
state
in
new
york,
which
exempt
from
real
estate
taxation
all
the
property
of
religious
corporations
used
solely
for
religious
purposes
violates
the
first
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
he
asserts
in
his
complaint
that
he's
a
christian
not
a
member
of
any
particular
sect,
and
objects
that
the
amount
by
which
his
taxes,
his
real
estate
taxes
are
increased
by
the
exemption
of
all
religiously
owned
property
for
use
of
religious
purposes
from
taxations,
constitutes
an
involuntary
contribution
by
him
to
the
activities
of
these
religious
organizations
which
violates
his
freedom
of
religion.
before
taking
up
my
main
argument
which
will
be
very
brief
because
the
principle
that
i
assert
is
very
simple,
i
would
like
to
address
one
word
to
corporation
counsel's
suggestion
in
the
first
point
of
his
brief
that
the
court
should
either
dismiss
or
affirm
this
appeal
on
the
ground
that
the
record
is
inadequate.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
all
of
the
facts
required
for
a
decision
of
this
issue
no
matter
how
momentous
it
maybe,
are
present
either
in
the
pleadings
or
in
the
facts
which
are
judicial
notice.
it
was
the
defendant
who
moved
for
summary
judgment
and
the
facts
were
quite
sufficient
to
obtain
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
and
the
defendant
is
not
in
a
good
position
here
to
assert
that
the
facts
are
not
sufficient
for
review
by
this
court.
the
--
all
of
the
facts
required
for
decision
are
present.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
well
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
well,
let
me
tell
you
what
i
know.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
mr.
walz
is
a
member
of
the
new
york
bar,
and
he's
taken
the
case
to
this
stage
and
intended
to
argue
the
case.
he
requested
me
to
argue
it
and
present
his
position
in
his
behalf
because
he
happens
to
be
suffering
from
a
very
high
blood
pressure
and
frankly,
he
stated
that
he
did
not
think
that
he
emotionally
could
undertake
the
responsibility
to
present
the
oral
argument
to
this
court.
i've
known
mr.
--
i
know
mr.
walz,
he's
been
in
my
office
several
times
and
i
can
communicate
with
him
anytime
i
wish.
i
mean
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
and
now,
going
to
the
merits
of
the
argument,
i
do
not
intend
to
quote
to
this
court
much
of
what
had
it
said
in
the
over
500
pages
that
the
court
has
written
between
gobitis
and
flast
on
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
the
first
amendment.
i
think
it
appropriate
however
that
we
approach
our
argument
with
the
statement
made
by
mr.
justice
jackson
speaking
for
the
court
in
the
barnett
case
which
established
that
this
flag
salute
have
violated
the
first
amendment.
now
mr.
justice
jackson
for
the
court
stated
that
the
task
of
translating
the
majestic
generalities
of
the
bill
of
rights
conceived
as
part
of
the
pattern
of
liberal
government
in
the
18th
century
into
concrete
restraints
on
officials
dealing
with
problems
of
the
20th
century
is
one
to
disturb
the
self
confidence.
these
changed
conditions
from
the
laissez
faire
situation
in
the
18th
century
for
the
government
control
of
our
century,
often
deprived
precedence
of
reliability
and
cast
us
more
than
we
would
choose
on
our
own
judgment,
but
we
act
in
these
matters
not
by
authority
of
our
confidence,
but
by
force
of
our
commissions.
we
cannot
because
of
modest
testaments
of
our
confidence
in
such
specialties
as
public
education
withhold
the
judgment
that
history
authenticates
as
the
function
of
this
court
when
liberty
is
infringed.
approaching
this
question,
it
is
the
appellant's
submission
that
the
plain
words,
the
first
ten
words
of
the
first
amendment
of
the
bill
of
rights
that
congress,
which
now
includes
the
states,
shall
pass
no
law
respecting
the
establishment
of
religion
bars
all
age
religion
including
the
massive
tax
exemption
from
real
estate
taxes
presented
in
this
case.
i
will
not
pause
to
lead
the
court
again
as
it
has
gone
through
its
opinions
through
the
course
in
the
first
congress
which
produced
these
general
words
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion.
it
is
suffice
to
say
that
out
of
the
narrower
words
introduced
into
the
house,
no
law
establishing
religion
and
out
of
the
still
narrow
words
introduced
into
the
senate,
no
law
establishing
articles
of
faith.
in
the
conference
between
the
two
houses,
in
which
mr.
madison
was
a
member
of
the
conference,
we
extracted
the
words
no
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
which
the
congress
adopted
and
the
states
adopted.
now,
this
court
has
said
in
everson
and
in
every
case
considered
since
everson
that
the
generalities
of
these
words
not
only
prohibit
the
establishment
of
a
church,
but
they
prohibit
any
aid
to
religion.
only
two
words
--
only
two
sentences
from
the
court's
opinion
in
everson
which
has
been
quoted
by
the
court
in
every
opinion
since.
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment
means
at
least
this,
“neither
a
state
nor
the
federal
government
can
set
up
a
church,
neither
can
pass
laws
which
aid
one
religion,
aid
all
religions
or
prefer
one
religion
over
another.”
the
appellant's
position
very
simply
is
that
just
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated
and
indeed
in
the
last
case
in
the
flast
case,
that
of
course
the
first
amendment
forbids
aid
to
religion
and
that
any
tax
funds
that
any
taxes
be
exacted
or
spent
on
religion.
that
it's
the
appellant's
submission
that
this
exemption
from
real
estate
taxes
is
precisely
the
same
as
if
the
state
of
new
york
had
passed
a
law
stating
that
all
religious
property
shall
be
valued,
so
that
at
least
we
might
know
its
valuation
and
its
increasing
valuation,
and
shall
be
taxed
like
all
other
property.
but
that
upon
application
by
the
taxpayer,
disclosing
that
it
is
a
religious
organization
and
that
the
property
is
used
solely
for
religious
purposes,
these
taxes
should
be
refunded.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
exemption
before
us
is
no
different,
and
that
if
this
court
would
strike
down
the
hypothetical
statute
i've
suggested,
it
should
strike
down
the
exemption
statute
of
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
no,
your
honor,
the
statute
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
of
course,
if
the
religious
corporation
is
in
the
general
provisions
which
exempts
educational
institutions,
hospitals
and
the
like,
and
it
includes
religious
corporations.
we
of
course
submit
your
honor,
i'll
have
a
word
to
say
about
the
suggestion
that
religion
can
be
subsumed
under
charitable
activities,
but
it
is
so
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned,
included
with
these
other
classifications.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
oh,
no,
no
of
course
not
your
honor.
the
hospitals,
the
asylums,
the
orphanages,
the
educational
institutions,
schools,
all
of
these
institutions
which
are
run
by
religious
organizations
are
exempt
from
real
estate
taxes
by
virtue
of
their
function.
our
argument
only
reaches
to
property
used
exclusively
for
religious
purposes.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
no,
no
it
does
not
at
all
your
honor.
but
the
statute
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
i
have
no
trouble
in
exempting
the
real
estate
from
taxation.
and
in
any
event,
your
honor,
the
statute
relieves
us
from
this
problem
because
the
statute
we're
addressing
ourself
to
exempts
only
property
which
is
used
exclusively
for
religious
purposes.
now,
we
do
not
have
to
address
ourselves
to
what
might
be
a
more
difficult
problem
as
is
to
whether
a
hospital
run
by
a
church
institution,
whether
physical
care
is
sufficiently
permeated
with
religious
instruction
to
render
it
suspect.
we
don't
have
to
deal
with
that.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
the
--
i
--
i
think
that
the
constitution
does
not
forbid
the
legislature
to
grant
exemptions
to
charitable
organizations,
but
only
to
religious
organizations.
it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
that
if
prayer
and
bible
reading
in
the
public
school
is
an
aid
to
religion,
it's
inescapable
that
the
practical
economic
financial
aid
of
real
estate
tax
exemption
is
an
aid
to
religion.
this
proposition
is
so
simple
that
it
is
rather
difficult
to
expand
upon
it.
its
very
statement
is
its
own
proof.
unless
this
court
is
prepared
to
say
that
factually
an
exemption
of
pure
property
use
purely
for
religious
purposes
is
not
an
aid
to
religion,
unless
the
court
is
prepared
to
say
that
it
must
say
that
is
an
aid
to
religion
which
is
unconstitutional.
i
think
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
defenses,
if
i
may
call
it
that
or
the
arguments
which
the
corporation
counsel
has
presented
in
his
brief
on
this
subject.
and
these
are
the
defenses
presented
usually
to
support
this
awkward
fact
that
we
have
in
all
of
the
states,
this
exemption,
and
although
we've
had
it
in
all
of
the
states
for
180
years,
it
now
for
the
first
time
comes
squarely
before
this
court
for
consideration.
the
first
argument
in
support
of
it
is
the
argument
of
history.
how
is
it
that
this
exemption
stands
on
the
books
of
all
the
states
for
so
long
without
having
been
challenged
in
this
court?
of
course,
the
answer
i
think
is
a
tribute
to
the
great
political
power
of
the
religious
organizations
in
this
country
that
have
been
able
to
achieve
that
this
exemption
from
taxes
for
so
long.
another
reason
is
that
when
this
started
in
the
beginning
of
our
republic,
the
tax
question
was
a
very
minor
one.
the
tax
question
has
only
loomed
large
when
in
part
as
a
result
of
tax
exemption,
religious
organizations
in
this
country
have
accumulated
literally
hundreds
of
billions
dollars
of
property.
and
now,
with
the
increasing
public
services,
social
services
that
are
required,
the
matter
becomes
acute
as
to
whether
this
isn't
part
of
the
real
estate
in
the
united
states
which
constitutionally
should
be
subject
to
tax.
and
indeed,
another
simple
argument
is
that
history
cannot
turn
aid
into
no
aid
not
only
real
estate
tax
exemption,
but
it's
been
common
in
our
public
schools
saying
public
prayers
and
bible
reading.
this
has
gone
on
since
the
beginning
of
the
republic,
but
it
only
reached
this
court
in
the
last
20
years
when
citizens
determined
to
raise
the
issue.
take
the
sunday
store
laws.
the
sunday
store
laws,
as
this
court
in
it
cases
--
in
its
decision
recognizes
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
this
of
course
had
a
religious
origin
and
yet,
they
went
on
with
this
religious
justification,
legislative
justification
was
religious,
they
went
on
from
the
beginning
of
the
republic
until
a
few
years
ago
and
the
court
in
its
opinion
stated
“we
would
strike
these
sunday
laws
down
as
unconstitutional
establishment
of
religion.”
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
in
the
development
of
our
country,
a
secular
reason
for
these
laws
has
supplanted
the
original
religious
purpose
of
the
laws.
and
the
court
said
that
“if
the
purpose
was
aid
to
religion,
these
sunday
laws
would've
been
stricken
down
and
they
were
saved
because
the
purpose
has
become
secular.”
now,
--
but
it's
only
as
our
country
developed
and
people
wanted
to
open
up
stores
on
sunday,
the
stores
that
were
involved
that
the
question
was
presented
to
this
court,
despite
that
fact
that
it
was
in
its
origins
unconstitutional,
although
not
tested.
i
think
that
this
takes
care
of
the
argument
from
history
to
the
extent
that
it
can
be
taken
care
of.
i
do
not
mean
to
blink
at
the
point
that
a
practice
which
has
existed
for
so
long,
it
carries
with
it
a
certain
historical
momentum
of
its
own.
but
this
court
is
no
stranger
to
striking
down
laws
as
unconstitutional
which
the
american
people
have
accepted
for
a
long
periods
of
time,
until
the
time
comes
when
a
citizen
properly
raises
the
question,
as
i
believe
mr.
walz
has
done,
and
requires
that
these
laws
be
stricken
down.
now,
the
second
point
that
mr.
rankin
makes,
and
it
also
has
its
interest,
is
that
the
exemption
really
supports
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
which
was
to
prevent
strike
between
the
religion
and
the
secular
state
that
leaving
the
state
alone
in
this
respect
promotes
that
neutrality
which
was
one
purpose
of
the
first
amendment.
if
the
court
please,
my
answer
to
that
is
that
taxing
real
estate
used
for
religious
purposes,
like
other
real
estate,
is
just
as
neutral
as
not
taxing
it.
there
is
no
--
there
is
not
intended
by
this
to
promote
any
conflict
with
the
church,
and
i
cannot
see
how
it
will
produce
a
conflict
with
the
church
to
treat
such
property
as
all
other
real
estate
is
treated.
now,
the
third
argument
that
mr.
rankin
refers
to
in
his
brief
is
also
a
common
one.
that
what
the
legislatures
have
done
have
considered
religion
like
other
charities
which
it
exempts.
that
it
is
true
of
course
that
religion
until
the
more
recent
period
of
our
history,
took
up
the
burden
of
charity.
the
alms
houses,
the
hospitals,
the
orphanages,
the
old
peoples
homes,
all
of
these
in
earlier
days
was
largely
left
to
religious
private
activity.
this
of
course
is
no
longer
the
case
and
it
explains,
i
think,
why
the
legislatures
have
placed
religious
activities
into
the
same
statutory
framework
as
other
charitable
activities,
but
it
cannot
satisfy
the
constitutional
requirement
that
both
the
congress
and
all
of
the
legislatures
are
expressly
prohibited
from
treating
religion
like
other
charitable
activities.
the
states
and
congress
are
prohibited
from
this.
now,
another
answer
is
that
the
prayer
which
this
--
the
prayer
of
the
public
schools
and
the
bible
reading
in
the
public
schools
which
this
court
has
stricken
down
as
unconstitutional,
that
promotes
moral
values,
just
as
religious
activity
promotes
moral
values,
but
just
as
--
that
is
not
a
sufficient
basis
to
save
the
prayer
the
fact
that
it
promotes
a
secular
object,
if
you
will,
namely
moral
considerations,
if
it
is
not
enough
to
save
that
the
prayer,
it
is
not
enough
to
save
the
tax
exemption.
now,
the
last
argument
that's
made
on
this
point
by
mr.
rankin
is
that
this
court
has
approved
other
exemptions.
for
example,
the
selective
service
exemption
where
the
court
excuses
ministers
or
rather
the
statute
excuses
ministers
and
conscientious
objectors
and
the
sunday
laws,
not
the
ones
that
the
court
struck
down,
but
those
laws
in
which
a
state
has
chosen
to
give
an
exemption
for
the
two
people
who
observed
the
sabbath
and
let
them
run
their
business
on
sunday.
the
distinction,
we
submit,
is
that
the
power
of
the
congress
in
the
interest
of
national
defense
and
general
welfare,
it
doesn't
have
to
give
those
exemptions.
it
did
give
them
out
of
respect
for
acts
of
conscience
for
religious
conscience,
but
it's
not
been
suggested
by
the
christian
churches
that
the
payment
of
real
estate
taxes
would
offend
their
freedom
of
religion
in
the
sense
of
their
freedom
of
conscience.
surely,
a
church
which
recognizes
that
caesar
shall
have
what
is
his
and
god
shall
have
what
is
his
would
not
make
the
argument
that
to
pay
real
estate
taxes
would
violate
their
conscientious
group.
they
merely
asked
to
be
exempt
for
the
payment
of
taxes,
and
i
think
this
is
a
great
distinction
between
these
cases.
now,
i'm
going
to
address
myself
in
just
very
briefly
to
an
argument
that
is
not
made
by
the
city
of
new
york
and
that
is
that
this
statute
is
required
by
the
free
exercise
clause.
that
argument
is
made
in
the
brief
of
the
national
counsel
of
the
churches
of
christ
in
the
united
states
of
america
by
mr.
tuttle,
who's
here
today
to
hear
the
argument.
now,
mr.
tuttle
relies
for
that
contention
that
these
laws
are
not
only
permissible
but
are
required
on
the
murdock
case
and
the
fallet
case.
now,
as
your
honors
will
recall
in
murdock,
the
court
stated
that
you
could
not
place
a
license
tax
on
the
very
activity
of
distributing
religious
literature
by
members
of
a
religious
sect
whose
--
the
essence
of
their
religious
activity
was
going
from
house
to
house,
distributing
and
selling
their
literature.
but
as
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
that
case,
this
is
quite
different
from
the
tax
on
property
used
for
religious
activities.
it
is
one
think
to
tax
a
preacher's
property
and
another
thing
to
tax
his
teaching.
we
say
that
there's
a
very
obvious
distinction
between
the
direct
tax
upon
the
religious
activity
involved
in
the
murdock
case
and
the
tax
on
the
land
and
the
wooden
stones
which
constitute
the
property
of
the
real
estate
tax
of
religious
property.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes,
my
point
is
your
honor
that
this
court
in
the
murdock
and
fallet
case
that
followed
it,
in
stating
that
attacks
directly
upon
the
activity
was
unconstitutional
because
it
did
limit
the
free
exercise
religion
that
mr.
justice
douglas
for
the
court,
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
his
concurring
opinion
expressly
distinguished
that
tax
from
the
tax
that
we
have
here.
for
example,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
in
very
plain
words,
“it
is
alien
to
our
constitutional
system
to
suggest
that
it
exempts
church
held
lands
from
state
taxation.”
in
other
words,
the
court
itself
has
very
plainly
made
the
distinction
from
the
direct
exercise
of
religion
not
subject
to
a
license
task,
and
indeed,
i
hardly
have
to
go
further
and
state
that
if
this
argument
were
true,
would
it
mean
that
the
great
real
estate
holdings
of
our
press
and
our
t.v.
organization
should
not
be
subject
to
tax
because
they
are
engaged
in
the
exercise
of
the
freedom
of
the
press?
it's
hardly
distinguishable.
the
land
used
by
the
new
york
times
to
print
its
paper
is
just
as
much
involved
in
the
freedom
of
the
press
as
the
church
building
used
in
expressing
religion.
now,
i
would
like
to
close
my
argument,
if
the
court
please,
by
a
one
sentence
statement
from
james
madison,
whom
this
court
has
recognized
in
many
opinions
as
the
very
architect
of
the
first
amendment.
when
he'd
retired
as
president
to
montpeller,
i
had
a
chance
to
review
all
he
had
done
and
the
attention
he'd
given
to
this
important
question
of
establishment
of
religion.
in
his
detached
memorandum,
which
i
hope
your
honors
will
again
read
because
he
has
the
fervor
and
eloquence
on
this
matter
which
i
can
not
match.
he
indeed
even
goes
so
far
in
the
detached
memorandum
as
to
say
that
the
chaplains
in
the
congress
and
in
the
army
and
navy
are
establishments
of
religion,
and
should
not
be
allowed.
and
he
concludes,
as
i
will
conclude
my
argument
with
one
sentence,
he
says
“it
is
safer
to
adhere
to
a
right
principle
and
trust
its
consequences
than
to
confide
in
reasoning
however
specious
in
fear
--
in
reliance
upon
a
wrong
one.”
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
the
exemption
of
churches
is
aid
to
religion
and
is
barred
by
the
first
amendment.
these
various
arguments
which
have
been
made
to
attempt
to
excuse
it
do
not
excuse
it,
and
are
form
of
specious
reasoning
which
the
court
or
should
not
accept,
which
should
hold
as
simple
logic
and
the
words
of
the
constitution
require
that
an
exemption
is
as
much
an
aid
to
religion
as
if
the
taxes
were
collected
and
returned
upon
application.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
i'd
like
to
make
just
two
statements
if
it
pleases
the
court.
one
that
the
corporation
counsel
has
gone
outside
the
record
to
tell
the
court
some
knowledge
he
has
about
the
value
of
mr.
walz's
property
and
how
much
his
taxes
were.
i
don't
have
that
information
and
in
the
affidavit,
a
five-page
affidavit
in
support
of
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
city
of
new
york
which
could've
easily
have
the
information
available
about
the
value
of
that
property
did
not
choose
to
make
that
point.
i
don't
think
that
should
be
taken
into
account.
and
about
this
specter
that
the
corporation
counsel
raises
that
if
we
have
to
value
the
property
of
churches
for
real
estate
tax
purposes
there
is
going
to
be
a
lot
of
certiorari
proceedings
in
the
like.
very
well,
one
of
the
socially
undesirable
factors
in
the
exemption
of
church
property
is
we
don't
have
any
idea
of
what
the
value
of
such
property
is,
and
there's
no
reason
we
shouldn't.
it's
not
true
to
suggest
that
knowledge
is
un-neutral
or
hostile,
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
we
know
the
value
of
the
--
increasing
value
of
the
property
of
religious
organizations
in
the
united
states,
why
not?
thank
you,
your
honor.
