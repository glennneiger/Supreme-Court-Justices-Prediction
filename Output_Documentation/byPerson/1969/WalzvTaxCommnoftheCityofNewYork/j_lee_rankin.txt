mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
the
position
of
the
city
of
new
york
that
this
case
should
either
be
dismissed
as
not
presenting
any
substantial
federal
question
in
light
of
the
record,
or
that
it
should
be
affirmed.
we
have
considerable
difficulty
with
the
position
of
mr.
ennis
and
the
civil
liberties
union
in
their
brief,
because
they
appear
to
recognize
that
if
you
single
out
religious
establishments
or
institutions
and
deny
to
them
an
exemption
which
you
grant
to
other
nonprofit,
charitable,
educational
activities
such
as
are
allowed
this
exemption
under
this
statute
and
under
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
new
york,
you
have
serious
problems.
they
do
not
frankly
say
that
it's
free
exercise
problem
but
i
do.
as
you
will
note
in
our
brief,
i
do
not
assert
that
we
reach
a
free
exercise
problem
with
regard
to
this
exemption
as
it
is
granted.
but
if
you're
going
to
say
that
religious
institutions,
who
have
the
same
legal
standing,
an
economic
standing,
are
nonprofit,
engaged
in
charitable
or
education
activities
are
thereby
to
be
singled
out
and
told
that
they
can
not
enjoy
the
same
exemption
by
reason
those
activities
as
other
people.
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
face
up
to
say
that
that
does
not
inhibit
religion
in
this
country.
now,
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
and
emphasize
the
history
of
this
exemption,
and
i
do
not
say
that
it
is
conclusive
of
on
the
court,
of
course
it
is
not,
but
it
has
great
bearing,
200
years
of
a
course
of
conduct
by
the
people
of
this
country
and
i
challenge
the
statement
that
it's
just
due
to
a
great
lobby.
to
me,
it
is
an
action
of
the
people
of
this
country
in
recognition
of
the
service
and
value
of
religion
to
sustaining
this
country
throughout
its
various
activities.
it
is
200
years
of
universal
consistent
conduct,
either
in
constitutional
provisions
or
statutes
and
uniformed
decisions
sustaining,
including
the
various
actions
of
this
court
some
four
times
finding
that
there
is
not
a
substantial
federal
question
in
three
cases,
and
not
taking
the
fourth
action.
but
it
is
glibly
assumed
in
the
argument
here
that
exemption
is
the
same
as
aid
to
religion
comparable
to
taxing
and
any
careful
examination
of
this
situation
will
not
bear
that
out.
it
isn't
supported
by
the
law
of
this
court,
interpretations
of
the
constitution
with
regard
to
taxation.
but
before
i
leave
the
history,
i
should
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
the
very
real
problem
that
you
present
the
government
in
trying
to
maintain
neutrality
in
neither
advancing
nor
inhibiting
religion.
if
you
say
to
the
government,
you
must
go
in
the
city
of
new
york
to
saint
patrick's
cathedral
and
assess
and
tax
based
upon
the
fair
and
reasonable
market
value
with
the
highest
use
of
that
property,
or
go
with
me
to
trinity
church
down
in
lower
manhattan
and
tell
us
to
do
the
same
or
any
little
chapel
in
outlying
areas,
harlem,
bronx,
queens,
brooklyn,
now
it
can
be
done.
but
in
that
process,
what
do
we
do
to
the
relationship
between
government
that
we're
trying
to
say
that
there's
a
separation
wall.
it's
difficult
to
imagine
how
much
taxes
we
would
assess
against
saint
patrick's,
trinity
church
and
some
of
the
others.
on
the
other
hand,
i
don't
want
to
minimize
the
effect
upon
the
little
chapel
in
the
community
which
proportionately
may
have
as
much
difficulty
or
more
in
meeting
this
assessment.
now,
how
does
this
200
years
of
history
bear
upon
that?
it
bears
upon
the
fact
of
the
way
our
people
have
lived
in
the
pluralism
of
our
religion
throughout
200
years
of
experience
in
dealing
with
this
very
problem.
they
have
proceeded
upon
the
assumption
from
the
earliest
days
of
the
very
same
time
that
this
establishment
took
place,
that
they
did
not
have
to
provide
the
taxes
for
their
place
of
worship
because
it
was
recognized
by
the
people,
their
legislatures
and
the
exemption
was
granted
either
in
constitution
or
in
legislation
or
in
both.
now,
after
200
years
with
established
parishes,
many
difficult
financial
problems
otherwise,
and
200
years
of
such
experience
of
our
people,
all
has
to
be
changed
overnight
by
a
ruling
of
this
court
and
they
have
to
find
a
way
to
either
provide
the
taxes
out
of
additional
contribution
by
their
parishioners,
or
move
the
church
to
some
place
that
they
can
afford.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
it
does
not
adequately
show
the
effect
of
tax
of
--
in
tax
exemption
of
this
kind,
or
tax
exemptions
if
you're
to
assume
that
they
are
aid
to
an
establishment
on
other
taxpayers
in
the
community.
this
appellant
had
purchased
a
property
for
$100.00,
i
think
he
pays
$5.47
something
like
that
in
taxes.
that's
a
very
skimpy
record
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
to
act
upon
if
you're
going
to
overturn
something
that's
been
present
for
over
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
gives
the
court
guidance
and
enlightenment
insofar
as
you
have
information
that
is
hard
evidence
in
a
record
as
distinguished
from
assumptions
or
inferences
or
whatever
picture
that
counsel
can
portray
to
the
court
with
regard
to
the
probable
situation.
that
is
what
i
was
calling
attention
to
in
regard
to
this
first
point.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
the
next
problem
as
i
see
it
is
the
assumption
in
regard
to
the
system
of
taxation.
and
the
question
of
whether
an
exemption
is
the
same
in
consideration
of
aid
to
religion
than
it
would
if
there
was
a
tax.
it
seems
to
me
it's
clear
that
the
exemption
is
neutral
as
distinguished
from
a
tax
which
can
be
discriminatory
in
--
very
easily
in
many
ways.
but
beyond
that,
they
say
religious
institutions
do
not
pay
their
fair
share
of
the
burden
of
government.
now,
that
is
not
a
constitutional
criteria,
this
court
has
said
that
legislatures
have
the
power
and
right
to
decide
who
shall
be
taxed
dependent
upon
the
question
of
whether
or
not
two
persons
in
exactly
--
precisely
similar
situations
as
to
economic
and
legal
conditions
are
treated
differently
by
the
government.
i
do
not
think
that
if
there
was
a
mere
exclusion
as
distinguished
from
exemption,
this
court
would
be
willing
to
accept
that
as
an
adequate
distinction
for
constitutional
purposes.
but
there's
no
question
about
what
the
court,
the
legislature,
could
choose
various
types
of
persons
who
are
not
similar
in
economic
and
legal
position,
and
decide
to
tax
them
and
decide
not
to
tax
a
religious
house
of
worship.
that
is
the
fallacy
in
this
situation.
there
is
an
assumption
that
religious
institutions
have
to
be
taxed
just
like
others,
or
there
is
aid.
there's
no
proof
of
it
and
it
doesn't
follow
our
law
in
regard
to
the
imposition
of
taxes,
and
the
power
of
legislatures
to
make
decisions
about
who
should
be
taxed
and
who
should
not.
it
doesn't
deal
with
what
other
taxes
churches
pay
in
the
course
of
the
whole
tax
structure
of
the
community,
either
new
york
or
other
communities
that
have
similar
exemptions
throughout
the
country.
it
just
says
that
there
must
be
a
sharing
in
the
cost
of
maintaining
these
benefits
and
it's
entirely
inadequate
to
meet
the
problem
from
a
constitutional
standpoint.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
would
find
much
more
difficulty
with
regard
to
that,
except
that
you
do
have
the
general
principles
of
tax
law
allowing
the
legislature
to
decide
that
a
corporation
for
instance,
all
corporations
should
pay
taxes,
no
corporations
should
pay
taxes
but
all
natural
persons
pay
taxes,
the
court
said
that
any
number
of
times.
so,
the
legislature
has
a
power
and
right
to
decide
that
the
funds
necessary
to
maintain
the
government,
maybe
to
select
--
taken
from
certain
selected
groups
providing
you
don't
violate
this
principle
that
i've
just
stated
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
now,
the
problem
is
whether
you're
getting
into
the
question
of
advancing
or
inhibiting
religion
in
that
particular
area
and
that's
the
only
problem
that
that
kind
of
a
situation
raises.
on
the
other
hand,
if
they
are
similar
in
regard
with
their
functions
to
charitable
and
educational
institutions
and
nonprofit
making,
and
then
you
say
“just
because
you're
religious,
you
can
have
any
exemption.”
it
seems
to
me
you're
singling
them
out
in
the
same
manner
in
a
way
that
the
constitution
does
not
permit.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
is
the
position
of
the
city
of
new
york
that
it
is
--
as
i
view
it
and
i
frankly
say,
i'm
not
familiar
with
all
the
religions
in
this
country.
i
do
consider
one
of
the
great
assets
of
this
country
is
the
fact
we
have
pluralism
in
religions,
that
you
can
start
any
religion
without
interference
by
government.
but
the
religions
i
know,
a
number
of
them,
all
have
an
inherent
part
of
the
religion
itself
that
you
shall
care
for
the
sick,
that
you
shall
care
for
orphans
and
the
elderly,
you
shall
provide
for
them.
the
ones
i
know
have
a
“might”
box
or
a
collection
time
after
time
throughout
the
year
to
support
those
activities.
some
of
them
i
know
have
a
deacon's
fund
administered
within
the
church
structure
itself
to
care
for
the
poor
and
the
unfortunate
and
it
is
a
part
of
the
doctrine
and
beliefs
of
the
church.
you
can
go
through
a
whole
cross
section
of
them,
that
people
who
have
that
religion
will
respect
it,
believe
it
and
that
is
part
of
the
doctrines
that
you
not
only
believe
in
but
you
contribute
to
as
a
part
of
your
worship,
and
you
conduct
that
in
the
church,
in
the
house
of
worship
and
the
solicitation
is
made
there
almost
every
week,
at
least
periodically.
and
many
churches
also
have
provision
for
their
own
institutions
that
they
maintain,
and
the
parishioners
are
asked
to
contribute
to
them
as
a
part
of
their
religious
belief
and
an
obligation
as
a
part
of
that
religion.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
where
you
finance,
a
church
school
or
hospital,
you
will
do
it,
where
this
court
will
permit
it
by
the
government.
it
will
be
in
connection
with
case
like
allen
or
other
situations
where
you
are
carrying
out
the
secular
function,
aiding
of
secular
function
which
is
not
directly
advancing
the
religion.
but
i
don't
think
that
you
can
say
that
you
can
separate
out
of
religion
the
elements
of
charity,
or
assistance
to
education,
or
other
aspects
that
are
the
heart
of
it
and
have
been
for
a
thousand
years.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
think
you've
ruled
that
kind
of
an
activity
out.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
a
tax
exemption
is
quite
different
from
a
direct
taxing
and
imposing
a
tax
upon
individual
in
order
that
he
contribute
to
the
support
of
particular
religious
activity.
a
tax
exemption
may
not
mean
anything
to
mr.
walz
or
to
me
as
a
taxpayer
in
new
york
city
or
many
others;
it
is
neutral
in
its
effect.
it
is
entirely
different
by
nature
under
tax
laws,
under
tax
constitutional
principles
from
the
other.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
can
see
many
problems
in
that
area
if
the
appellant
were
to
prevail
here,
because
as
professor
bitkerr
develops
in
his
article
in
the
yale
law
journal,
you
would
have
the
similar
problem
with
regard
to
the
internal
revenue
act,
the
various
provisions
that
mr.
chief
justice,
you're
describing
and
tax
laws
throughout
the
federal
structure
as
to
whether
or
not
if
this
is
aid
to
education,
aid
to
religion,
that
would
not
also
be
aid
to
religion.
and
you
would
conflict
immediately
in
that
whole
area
with
those
laws.
i
think
it
would
cause
a
reexamination
of
the
entire
tax
structure
and
the
exemptions
that
are
allowed
in
connection
with
religious
charitable
and
educational
activities
and
gifts
as
state
benefits.
finally,
i'd
like
to
say
that
i
think
this
would
have
a
great
impact
upon
the
social
structure
of
this
country
if
the
appellant
should
prevail
in
this
action.
i
think
it
would
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it
would
penalize
the
small
churches.
the
great
establishments
would
be
able
to
adjust
to
it.
the
little
parish
church
in
the
core
city,
in
the
country
side
that
does
not
--
is
not
able
to
fall
back
upon
the
general
congregations
throughout
the
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
conclude
my
argument
very
briefly.
it
seemed
to
me
that
one
of
the
things
that
the
court
would
like
to
examine
which
i
have
put
there
in
connection
with
this
case,
is
what
has
happened
after
200
years
of
this
exemption
with
regard
to
the
fears
that
this
court
has
described
that
brought
about
the
provisions
in
the
first
amendment
about
establishment
and
free
exercise.
have
any
of
those
feared
conditions
that
were
the
basis
for
these
provisions
of
the
first
amendment
come
about
or
appear
on
the
horizon
in
connection
with
this
matter?
your
--
the
court
will
recall
its
reference
to
various
things,
the
fears
that
brought
about
this
amendment,
destruction
of
the
government,
degradation
of
religion,
persecutions
that
were
occurred
trying
to
obtain
political
religious
supremacy
for
various
religions,
the
establishment
of
a
particular
governmental
faith
which
was
disestablished
about
the
same
time
as
the
exemptions
were
passed
by
the
legislatures.
the
various
persecutions
and
attacks
upon
individuals
who
didn't
support
the
established
church,
taxes
for
the
payment
of
minister's
salaries
and
the
building
of
churches.
there
have
been
at
least
one
case
this
court
passed
upon
in
regard
to
taxing
the
bill
of
church
and
of
course
it
was
stricken
down.
and
we
find
none
of
those
particular
tiers
of
--
that
brought
about
the
amendment
that
are
either
present
in
our
situation
or
after
200
years
or
as
i
can
see
it,
threat.
we
have
great
pluralism
in
religions
of
all
kinds
of
beliefs,
either
of
a
god
or
no
god,
and
you
can
almost
hardly
imagine
the
range
that
they
cover
in
this
country,
and
as
i
said
before
is
one
of
our
great
assets.
but
if
you
decide
to
sustain
the
appeal
in
this
case,
we
are
going
to
have
government
up
to
its
ears
in
religion.
in
religious
--
in
examination
of
all
these
exemptions
that
are
provided
in
the
tax
laws
for
religious
institutions,
because
we
will
have
to
know
what
they
make,
what
their
properties
are
worth,
what
they
claim
they're
worth.
we
will
have
all
kinds
of
certiorari
contests
like
we
do
with
other
people
in
the
community,
about
the
value
of
their
church
property
and
that
the
taxes
are
too
high
as
compared
with
other
people,
and
we
will
have
to
know
what
moneys
they
take
in
and
all
of
those
various
things.
so
instead
of
being
neutral,
as
this
exemption
permits
and
provides,
we
will
be
so
engrossed
in
religious
activities
which
is
the
very
thing,
i
submit
to
you,
that
this
country
has
been
trying
to
provide
against
by
this
amendment,
and
this
court
has
used
such
great
care
in
order
to
provide
and
insist
upon
a
separation
of
church
and
state.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
the
position
of
the
city
of
new
york
that
this
case
should
either
be
dismissed
as
not
presenting
any
substantial
federal
question
in
light
of
the
record,
or
that
it
should
be
affirmed.
we
have
considerable
difficulty
with
the
position
of
mr.
ennis
and
the
civil
liberties
union
in
their
brief,
because
they
appear
to
recognize
that
if
you
single
out
religious
establishments
or
institutions
and
deny
to
them
an
exemption
which
you
grant
to
other
nonprofit,
charitable,
educational
activities
such
as
are
allowed
this
exemption
under
this
statute
and
under
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
new
york,
you
have
serious
problems.
they
do
not
frankly
say
that
it's
free
exercise
problem
but
i
do.
as
you
will
note
in
our
brief,
i
do
not
assert
that
we
reach
a
free
exercise
problem
with
regard
to
this
exemption
as
it
is
granted.
but
if
you're
going
to
say
that
religious
institutions,
who
have
the
same
legal
standing,
an
economic
standing,
are
nonprofit,
engaged
in
charitable
or
education
activities
are
thereby
to
be
singled
out
and
told
that
they
can
not
enjoy
the
same
exemption
by
reason
those
activities
as
other
people.
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
face
up
to
say
that
that
does
not
inhibit
religion
in
this
country.
now,
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
and
emphasize
the
history
of
this
exemption,
and
i
do
not
say
that
it
is
conclusive
of
on
the
court,
of
course
it
is
not,
but
it
has
great
bearing,
200
years
of
a
course
of
conduct
by
the
people
of
this
country
and
i
challenge
the
statement
that
it's
just
due
to
a
great
lobby.
to
me,
it
is
an
action
of
the
people
of
this
country
in
recognition
of
the
service
and
value
of
religion
to
sustaining
this
country
throughout
its
various
activities.
it
is
200
years
of
universal
consistent
conduct,
either
in
constitutional
provisions
or
statutes
and
uniformed
decisions
sustaining,
including
the
various
actions
of
this
court
some
four
times
finding
that
there
is
not
a
substantial
federal
question
in
three
cases,
and
not
taking
the
fourth
action.
but
it
is
glibly
assumed
in
the
argument
here
that
exemption
is
the
same
as
aid
to
religion
comparable
to
taxing
and
any
careful
examination
of
this
situation
will
not
bear
that
out.
it
isn't
supported
by
the
law
of
this
court,
interpretations
of
the
constitution
with
regard
to
taxation.
but
before
i
leave
the
history,
i
should
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
the
very
real
problem
that
you
present
the
government
in
trying
to
maintain
neutrality
in
neither
advancing
nor
inhibiting
religion.
if
you
say
to
the
government,
you
must
go
in
the
city
of
new
york
to
saint
patrick's
cathedral
and
assess
and
tax
based
upon
the
fair
and
reasonable
market
value
with
the
highest
use
of
that
property,
or
go
with
me
to
trinity
church
down
in
lower
manhattan
and
tell
us
to
do
the
same
or
any
little
chapel
in
outlying
areas,
harlem,
bronx,
queens,
brooklyn,
now
it
can
be
done.
but
in
that
process,
what
do
we
do
to
the
relationship
between
government
that
we're
trying
to
say
that
there's
a
separation
wall.
it's
difficult
to
imagine
how
much
taxes
we
would
assess
against
saint
patrick's,
trinity
church
and
some
of
the
others.
on
the
other
hand,
i
don't
want
to
minimize
the
effect
upon
the
little
chapel
in
the
community
which
proportionately
may
have
as
much
difficulty
or
more
in
meeting
this
assessment.
now,
how
does
this
200
years
of
history
bear
upon
that?
it
bears
upon
the
fact
of
the
way
our
people
have
lived
in
the
pluralism
of
our
religion
throughout
200
years
of
experience
in
dealing
with
this
very
problem.
they
have
proceeded
upon
the
assumption
from
the
earliest
days
of
the
very
same
time
that
this
establishment
took
place,
that
they
did
not
have
to
provide
the
taxes
for
their
place
of
worship
because
it
was
recognized
by
the
people,
their
legislatures
and
the
exemption
was
granted
either
in
constitution
or
in
legislation
or
in
both.
now,
after
200
years
with
established
parishes,
many
difficult
financial
problems
otherwise,
and
200
years
of
such
experience
of
our
people,
all
has
to
be
changed
overnight
by
a
ruling
of
this
court
and
they
have
to
find
a
way
to
either
provide
the
taxes
out
of
additional
contribution
by
their
parishioners,
or
move
the
church
to
some
place
that
they
can
afford.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
it
does
not
adequately
show
the
effect
of
tax
of
--
in
tax
exemption
of
this
kind,
or
tax
exemptions
if
you're
to
assume
that
they
are
aid
to
an
establishment
on
other
taxpayers
in
the
community.
this
appellant
had
purchased
a
property
for
$100.00,
i
think
he
pays
$5.47
something
like
that
in
taxes.
that's
a
very
skimpy
record
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
to
act
upon
if
you're
going
to
overturn
something
that's
been
present
for
over
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
gives
the
court
guidance
and
enlightenment
insofar
as
you
have
information
that
is
hard
evidence
in
a
record
as
distinguished
from
assumptions
or
inferences
or
whatever
picture
that
counsel
can
portray
to
the
court
with
regard
to
the
probable
situation.
that
is
what
i
was
calling
attention
to
in
regard
to
this
first
point.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
the
next
problem
as
i
see
it
is
the
assumption
in
regard
to
the
system
of
taxation.
and
the
question
of
whether
an
exemption
is
the
same
in
consideration
of
aid
to
religion
than
it
would
if
there
was
a
tax.
it
seems
to
me
it's
clear
that
the
exemption
is
neutral
as
distinguished
from
a
tax
which
can
be
discriminatory
in
--
very
easily
in
many
ways.
but
beyond
that,
they
say
religious
institutions
do
not
pay
their
fair
share
of
the
burden
of
government.
now,
that
is
not
a
constitutional
criteria,
this
court
has
said
that
legislatures
have
the
power
and
right
to
decide
who
shall
be
taxed
dependent
upon
the
question
of
whether
or
not
two
persons
in
exactly
--
precisely
similar
situations
as
to
economic
and
legal
conditions
are
treated
differently
by
the
government.
i
do
not
think
that
if
there
was
a
mere
exclusion
as
distinguished
from
exemption,
this
court
would
be
willing
to
accept
that
as
an
adequate
distinction
for
constitutional
purposes.
but
there's
no
question
about
what
the
court,
the
legislature,
could
choose
various
types
of
persons
who
are
not
similar
in
economic
and
legal
position,
and
decide
to
tax
them
and
decide
not
to
tax
a
religious
house
of
worship.
that
is
the
fallacy
in
this
situation.
there
is
an
assumption
that
religious
institutions
have
to
be
taxed
just
like
others,
or
there
is
aid.
there's
no
proof
of
it
and
it
doesn't
follow
our
law
in
regard
to
the
imposition
of
taxes,
and
the
power
of
legislatures
to
make
decisions
about
who
should
be
taxed
and
who
should
not.
it
doesn't
deal
with
what
other
taxes
churches
pay
in
the
course
of
the
whole
tax
structure
of
the
community,
either
new
york
or
other
communities
that
have
similar
exemptions
throughout
the
country.
it
just
says
that
there
must
be
a
sharing
in
the
cost
of
maintaining
these
benefits
and
it's
entirely
inadequate
to
meet
the
problem
from
a
constitutional
standpoint.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
would
find
much
more
difficulty
with
regard
to
that,
except
that
you
do
have
the
general
principles
of
tax
law
allowing
the
legislature
to
decide
that
a
corporation
for
instance,
all
corporations
should
pay
taxes,
no
corporations
should
pay
taxes
but
all
natural
persons
pay
taxes,
the
court
said
that
any
number
of
times.
so,
the
legislature
has
a
power
and
right
to
decide
that
the
funds
necessary
to
maintain
the
government,
maybe
to
select
--
taken
from
certain
selected
groups
providing
you
don't
violate
this
principle
that
i've
just
stated
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
now,
the
problem
is
whether
you're
getting
into
the
question
of
advancing
or
inhibiting
religion
in
that
particular
area
and
that's
the
only
problem
that
that
kind
of
a
situation
raises.
on
the
other
hand,
if
they
are
similar
in
regard
with
their
functions
to
charitable
and
educational
institutions
and
nonprofit
making,
and
then
you
say
“just
because
you're
religious,
you
can
have
any
exemption.”
it
seems
to
me
you're
singling
them
out
in
the
same
manner
in
a
way
that
the
constitution
does
not
permit.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
is
the
position
of
the
city
of
new
york
that
it
is
--
as
i
view
it
and
i
frankly
say,
i'm
not
familiar
with
all
the
religions
in
this
country.
i
do
consider
one
of
the
great
assets
of
this
country
is
the
fact
we
have
pluralism
in
religions,
that
you
can
start
any
religion
without
interference
by
government.
but
the
religions
i
know,
a
number
of
them,
all
have
an
inherent
part
of
the
religion
itself
that
you
shall
care
for
the
sick,
that
you
shall
care
for
orphans
and
the
elderly,
you
shall
provide
for
them.
the
ones
i
know
have
a
“might”
box
or
a
collection
time
after
time
throughout
the
year
to
support
those
activities.
some
of
them
i
know
have
a
deacon's
fund
administered
within
the
church
structure
itself
to
care
for
the
poor
and
the
unfortunate
and
it
is
a
part
of
the
doctrine
and
beliefs
of
the
church.
you
can
go
through
a
whole
cross
section
of
them,
that
people
who
have
that
religion
will
respect
it,
believe
it
and
that
is
part
of
the
doctrines
that
you
not
only
believe
in
but
you
contribute
to
as
a
part
of
your
worship,
and
you
conduct
that
in
the
church,
in
the
house
of
worship
and
the
solicitation
is
made
there
almost
every
week,
at
least
periodically.
and
many
churches
also
have
provision
for
their
own
institutions
that
they
maintain,
and
the
parishioners
are
asked
to
contribute
to
them
as
a
part
of
their
religious
belief
and
an
obligation
as
a
part
of
that
religion.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
where
you
finance,
a
church
school
or
hospital,
you
will
do
it,
where
this
court
will
permit
it
by
the
government.
it
will
be
in
connection
with
case
like
allen
or
other
situations
where
you
are
carrying
out
the
secular
function,
aiding
of
secular
function
which
is
not
directly
advancing
the
religion.
but
i
don't
think
that
you
can
say
that
you
can
separate
out
of
religion
the
elements
of
charity,
or
assistance
to
education,
or
other
aspects
that
are
the
heart
of
it
and
have
been
for
a
thousand
years.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
think
you've
ruled
that
kind
of
an
activity
out.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
a
tax
exemption
is
quite
different
from
a
direct
taxing
and
imposing
a
tax
upon
individual
in
order
that
he
contribute
to
the
support
of
particular
religious
activity.
a
tax
exemption
may
not
mean
anything
to
mr.
walz
or
to
me
as
a
taxpayer
in
new
york
city
or
many
others;
it
is
neutral
in
its
effect.
it
is
entirely
different
by
nature
under
tax
laws,
under
tax
constitutional
principles
from
the
other.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
can
see
many
problems
in
that
area
if
the
appellant
were
to
prevail
here,
because
as
professor
bitkerr
develops
in
his
article
in
the
yale
law
journal,
you
would
have
the
similar
problem
with
regard
to
the
internal
revenue
act,
the
various
provisions
that
mr.
chief
justice,
you're
describing
and
tax
laws
throughout
the
federal
structure
as
to
whether
or
not
if
this
is
aid
to
education,
aid
to
religion,
that
would
not
also
be
aid
to
religion.
and
you
would
conflict
immediately
in
that
whole
area
with
those
laws.
i
think
it
would
cause
a
reexamination
of
the
entire
tax
structure
and
the
exemptions
that
are
allowed
in
connection
with
religious
charitable
and
educational
activities
and
gifts
as
state
benefits.
finally,
i'd
like
to
say
that
i
think
this
would
have
a
great
impact
upon
the
social
structure
of
this
country
if
the
appellant
should
prevail
in
this
action.
i
think
it
would
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it
would
penalize
the
small
churches.
the
great
establishments
would
be
able
to
adjust
to
it.
the
little
parish
church
in
the
core
city,
in
the
country
side
that
does
not
--
is
not
able
to
fall
back
upon
the
general
congregations
throughout
the
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
conclude
my
argument
very
briefly.
it
seemed
to
me
that
one
of
the
things
that
the
court
would
like
to
examine
which
i
have
put
there
in
connection
with
this
case,
is
what
has
happened
after
200
years
of
this
exemption
with
regard
to
the
fears
that
this
court
has
described
that
brought
about
the
provisions
in
the
first
amendment
about
establishment
and
free
exercise.
have
any
of
those
feared
conditions
that
were
the
basis
for
these
provisions
of
the
first
amendment
come
about
or
appear
on
the
horizon
in
connection
with
this
matter?
your
--
the
court
will
recall
its
reference
to
various
things,
the
fears
that
brought
about
this
amendment,
destruction
of
the
government,
degradation
of
religion,
persecutions
that
were
occurred
trying
to
obtain
political
religious
supremacy
for
various
religions,
the
establishment
of
a
particular
governmental
faith
which
was
disestablished
about
the
same
time
as
the
exemptions
were
passed
by
the
legislatures.
the
various
persecutions
and
attacks
upon
individuals
who
didn't
support
the
established
church,
taxes
for
the
payment
of
minister's
salaries
and
the
building
of
churches.
there
have
been
at
least
one
case
this
court
passed
upon
in
regard
to
taxing
the
bill
of
church
and
of
course
it
was
stricken
down.
and
we
find
none
of
those
particular
tiers
of
--
that
brought
about
the
amendment
that
are
either
present
in
our
situation
or
after
200
years
or
as
i
can
see
it,
threat.
we
have
great
pluralism
in
religions
of
all
kinds
of
beliefs,
either
of
a
god
or
no
god,
and
you
can
almost
hardly
imagine
the
range
that
they
cover
in
this
country,
and
as
i
said
before
is
one
of
our
great
assets.
but
if
you
decide
to
sustain
the
appeal
in
this
case,
we
are
going
to
have
government
up
to
its
ears
in
religion.
in
religious
--
in
examination
of
all
these
exemptions
that
are
provided
in
the
tax
laws
for
religious
institutions,
because
we
will
have
to
know
what
they
make,
what
their
properties
are
worth,
what
they
claim
they're
worth.
we
will
have
all
kinds
of
certiorari
contests
like
we
do
with
other
people
in
the
community,
about
the
value
of
their
church
property
and
that
the
taxes
are
too
high
as
compared
with
other
people,
and
we
will
have
to
know
what
moneys
they
take
in
and
all
of
those
various
things.
so
instead
of
being
neutral,
as
this
exemption
permits
and
provides,
we
will
be
so
engrossed
in
religious
activities
which
is
the
very
thing,
i
submit
to
you,
that
this
country
has
been
trying
to
provide
against
by
this
amendment,
and
this
court
has
used
such
great
care
in
order
to
provide
and
insist
upon
a
separation
of
church
and
state.
