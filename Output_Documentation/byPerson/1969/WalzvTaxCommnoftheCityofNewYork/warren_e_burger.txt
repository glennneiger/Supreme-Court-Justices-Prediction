if

mr.
rankin,
when
i
put
the
question
to
mr.
ennis
about
church
operated
schools
where
religion
is
regularly
taught,
understandably,
he
wants
to
argue
the
case
he
has
here
and
not
some
other
case,
but
i
wonder
if
you'd
care
to
comment
on
whether
a
court
could
find
that
such
a
church
operated
school
which
received
tax
exemption
was
not
receiving
the
same
kind
of
in
quotation
marks
“aid
to
religion”
that
is
argued
is
now
extended
to
the
churches?
chief

warren
e.

mr.
rankin,
if
the
appellant
were
to
prevail
with
his
arguments
that
this
constitutes
an
aid
to
religion,
to
the
establishment
of
religion,
would
you
see
any
bearing
on
that
kind
of
a
ruling
and
the
allowance
of
deductions
for
contributions
to
church
which
is
now
creature
of
statute
and
governed
by
regulations
of
i
think
most
of
the
states
and
certainly
the
federal
government?
chief
justice
warren
e.

in
other
words,
could
that
exemption
survive
if
the

prevailed
here?
