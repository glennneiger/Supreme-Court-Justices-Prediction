it?
justice
john
m.

could
i
ask
you
this
question?
supposing
new

changed
its
statute
and
granted
the

to
every
kind
of
charitable

except
a
purely
religious
organization,
would
you
think

question?

you
don't.

is
an

would
you
say
about
a

appeal
to
this

all
charitable

overall,
a
charitable
corporation
is
nonreligious
charitable
corporation
and
let
the
stand
only
