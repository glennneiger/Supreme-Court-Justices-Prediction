justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
defendant
refused
to
give
the
name,
what
could
he
then
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
they
would
decline
to
the
familiar
relevant
witness
to
testify
in
its
favor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
is
happened
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
the
state
need
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
search
the
truth?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
who's
going
to
be
a
witness
for
the
alibi?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
it
wouldn't
be
looking
forward
to
mr.
3200
to
investigating
the
witness
and
the
people
around
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
remain
silent
about
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
about
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
about
the
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
are
the
witnesses.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
wouldn't
give
them
the
right
to
remain
silent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
state
--
no
he
could
remain
silent
as
the
state
can
go
and
say,
now
what
witnesses
you're
going
to
bring
in
here
to
prove
you
are
not
guilty
and
they
could
force
him
to
do
it.
he
doesn't
have
a
right
to
remain
silent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
about
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
weakens
his
hands
of
course.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
take,
i
take
as
a
very
valuable
thing
for
a
prosecutor
to
have
in
advance
and
they
have
been
the
alibi
witness.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
may
be
allowed
but
the
constitution
requires
that's
help
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
maybe
there
are
a
lot
of
state
law
of
our
constitutions
that
do
requires
that
the
state
give
the
names.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
senate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
presume
that
nothing
in
the
constitutions
says
that
state
shall
not
be
compelled
to
give
any
testimony
on
either
side
in
advance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
don't
you
put
him
on
the
stand
when
you
require
that
he
give
the
names
of
the
witnesses
he
intends
to
use?
justice
hugo
l.
black
won't
this
force
him
to
testify?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
is
maybe
not
something
relevant
to
the
actual
commission
of
the
crime
and
certainly
does
make
him
testify
and
give
the
names
of
the
witnesses
he
intends
to
use.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
saying
it
is
good
or
bad,
i'm
just
saying
it
does
make
him
do
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
it
require
him
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
intends
to
use?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes
but
suppose
you
said
everything,
why
wouldn't
he
think
good
about
alibi,
why
couldn't
he
do
it
about
everything?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
guess
there's
another
provision
in
the
constitution
says
that
the
man
shall
be
entitled
to
summon
witnesses
with
no
things
that
are
relevant
to
testify
on
his
behalf.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
know
the
next
judge
wouldn't
do
differently
and
make
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
you'll
be
saying
then
that
a
fair
thing
a
judge
would
do
would
be
not
to
the
enforce
the
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
they
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
violation
of
the
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
has
the
right
to
do
it
if
we
wants
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
that
law
should
be
provide
that
he's
compelled
to
give
the
state
the
names
of
all
witnesses
that
he
claims
witness
to
the
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
can
remain
absolutely
mute,
he
has
to
give
the
name
of
the
witnesses
he's
going
to
use.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
state
court
might
tell
him
that
he
can't
afford
to
put
on
these
witnesses.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
could,
can
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
can
under
the
rule,
can't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
they've
always
violated
the
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
we'd
have
to
assume
that
they'll
always
--
he
then
have
to
give
the
name?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
they'll
always
never
enforce
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
quite
a
different
argument
the
one
you've
been
making
up
today,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
he
did
it
because
he
thought
he'd
have
to
under
the
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
did
it
adopt
six
men
jury
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black

the

what

is

why
does
the
state
need
that?
justice

who's
going
