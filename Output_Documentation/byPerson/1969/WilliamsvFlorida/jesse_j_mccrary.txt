mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondent
would
like
to
respectfully
address
itself
to
the
issues
as
they
have
been
raised
in
our
brief.
the
first
issue
being,
do
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
fifth
amendment
privileges
against
self
incrimination
violated
by
requirement
that
a
defendant
disclosed
ten
days
prior
to
trial,
his
intent
to
rely
on
alibi
defenses.
first,
i
would
like
to
say
that
florida's
rule
of
notice
of
alibi
as
we
were
referring
to
it
is
fundamentally
fair
and
it's
not
unconstitutional.
the
rule
is
not
designed
in
any
way
for
a
defendant
to
say
anything
against
himself.
the
rule
is
a
rule
of
procedure.
now,
the
constitution,
it
do
not
think
does
not
grant
to
a
defendant
the
right
to
so
have
the
kind
of
defense,
so
that
the
state
cannot
check
the
veracity
of
that
defense
and
that's
what
he
is
suggesting
here.
all
that
the
constitution
or
all
that
we
profit
to
the
court
today
is
that
upon
a
written
demand
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
we
want
to
straighten
out
a
few
of
the
concessions
that
we
were
supposed
to
have
made
that
there
must
be
a
written
demand
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
first
to
a
defendant
asking
whether
or
not
he
intends
to
rely
on
an
alibi
defense.
if
he
so
does,
then
and
only
then
is
he
required
to
give
the
names
of
the
witnesses
as
are
known
to
him
who
will
testify
for
him.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
it's
necessary
during
a
time
when
we
are
trying
to
modernize
criminal
law
in
its
search
for
truth.
and
i
don't
think
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
think
it
is
because
if
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
it
helps
to
avoid
the
popping
up
of
phony
alibis.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
how
would
it?
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
because
if
the
state
has
an
opportunity
or
the
state
knows
of
the
witnesses
that
the
defendant
intends
to
use
as
an
alibi
and
the
alibi
statute
probably
states
that
if
alibi,
the
defendant
was
not
at
a
particular
place
at
a
particular
time,
therefore
he
could
not
have
permitted
the
crime.
it
gives
the
state
an
opportunity
then
if
nothing
else
to
know
a
price
or
to
dismiss
the
matter.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
i
think
that
you
are
correct
sir,
i
think
that
the
state
is
looking
to
find
out
the
truth
of
the
matter
whether
or
not
a
person
did
commit
a
crime.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
i
think
the
state
does
have
the
right
to
talk
to
those
witnesses.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
no
sir,
i
do
not.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
unethical
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
find
that
in
the
same
rule
that
the
state
does
provide
that
we
are
obligated
to
give
to
you
the
names
of
all
of
our
witnesses
and
we
are
under
continuing
obligation
to
give
to
the
defendant.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
this
is
not
the
rule.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
you
may
get
more
truth
your
honor.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
i
will
not
advocate
that
rule
to
the
court
today.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
you
honor,
i
don't
want
to
go
that
far
over
on
the
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
i
think
we
can
do
it
here
because
we
--
it's
an
attempt
to
modernize
and
it's
reciprocal
kind
of
discovery.
i
see
nothing
unconstitutional
about
it,
there
is
no
abridgement
of
his
right
to
remain
silent.
it
is
not
testimonial.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir
but
it
just
--
this
does
not
abridge
his
right
as
he
maintains
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
remain
silent.
when
we
look
at
the
rule,
the
rule
is,
it
is
absolutely
reasonable
and
constitutional.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
he
is
not
required
in
anyway
to
say
anything
that
will
incriminate
himself.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
about
the
crime
or
the
offense.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
about
the
trial.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
that
talking
about
the
witnesses
your
honor
has
anything
to
do
with
incriminating
him
or
it's
not
testimonial
to
the
extent
that
the
fifth
amendment
would
cover
that
situation.
i
think
that
all
he
is
doing
at
this
point
is
tendering
a
name,
the
names
of
witnesses
that
he
is
going
to
use
for
one
instance,
alibi.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
he
has
that
right.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
he
has
the
right
to
remain
silent
as
i
understand.
this
court's
decision
in
malloy
versus
hogan.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
he
has
the
unfettered
right
to
remain
silent
about
incrimination
and
what
he
gives
to
the
state
in
terms
of
witnesses
does
not
incriminate
him.
and
what
they
are
suggesting
to
us
is
that
we
ought
to
make
criminal
law.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
it
does
not
weaken
his
hands.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
very
valuable.
additionally,
i
think
it's
very
valuable
to
a
defendant
to
have
the
names
of
the
witnesses
that
the
state
will
use
to
rebut
this
testimony.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
sir?
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
state
of
florida
does
too.
i
would
suggest
to
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
i
don't
remember
anything
in
the
constitution
saying
that
i
--
as
we
discussed
this
i
am
reminded
of
schneider
versus
massachusetts
where
a
former
member
this
court
mr.
justice
cardoza
said
that
while
due
process
is
due
to
the
accuser
it
is
also
due
to
the
accused
and
that's
precisely
what
we
are
talking
about.
that
we
are
not
abridging
him
of
any
right
to
remain
silent
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
no
sir,
the
state
of
florida
does
not
concede
that
it's
testimonial.
what
i
think
we
are
talking
about
here
is
that
petitioner
is
probably
trying
to
make
criminal
law
like
a
poker
game
so
that
the
person
who
has
the
biggest
surprise
at
trial
then
should
win
and
probably
would
in
many
instances.
but
we
had
cases
in
this
court,
and
other
inferior
courts
probably
have
suggested
that
the
whole
purpose
of
trials
in
both
criminal
and
civil
proceedings
is
the
search
for
truth.
now,
we
are
not
suggesting
in
any
way
that
this
defendant
should
be
required
to
get
on
the
stand
or
not
to
get
on
the
stand.
we
are
simply
saying
that
if
you
intend
to
use
alibi
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor,
this
would
be
a
clear
violation
of
all
of
the
cases
that
this
court
have
decided,
if
we
forced
a
man
to
testify
and
we
are
not
suggesting
that.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
no
sir
it
does
not.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
i
respectfully
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
court,
mr.
justice
black
with
you
on
that
position.
it
does
not
in
my
opinion
require
him
to
testify
because
it
is
a
matter
of
timing.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
it
simply
requires
him
to
disclose
the
names
of
the
witnesses.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
for
alibi
alone.
this
is
all
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
then
i
suppose
they
could
do
it
about
everything
and
i
don't
think
i'm
in
a
position
to
discuss
the
constitutionality
of
that
principle
on
this
occasion.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
i
would
agree.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
under
this
rule
your
honor.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
he
does
not
have
to
give
any
information
that
would
incriminate
him
and
this
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
i
would
agree
your
honor.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
he
can
stand
mute.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor,
the
rule
--
if
the
rule
does
provide
that
he
can
stand
silent.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
no
the
rule
does
not
go
that
for
us
mr.
kanner
said.
the
rule
to
answer
mr.
justice
black's
question
specifically
provides
that
if
he
does
not
comply
with
the
rule,
the
trial
judge
may
exclude
the
testimony.
it
does
not
say
that
he
can
not
use
that.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
quite
agree,
i
think
that
the
same
court
that
decided
this
case,
the
third
district
court
of
appeal
is
mindful
of
this
and
we
cited
it
at
page
14
in
our
brief,
(inaudible)
versus
state
of
florida
and
wilson
versus
the
state
of
florida
where
the
defendant
did
not
comply
with
the
notice
of
alibi
rule
and
the
court
still
let
those
witnesses
testify
so
that
the
rule
is
not
an
un-reasonable
rule
where
we
say
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor,
i
have
to
assume
from
my
position
that
judges
are
fair
and
that
they
are
knowledgeable
and
reasonable
that
they
will
apply
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
oh!
no
sir.
i
am
certainly
not
saying
that.
i'm
simply
saying
that
the
florida
cases
have
been
decided
on
this
rule.
the
judge
has
allowed
the
alibi
witness
to
testify
even
where
the
defendant
in
some
instances
did
not
comply
with
the
request.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
he
thought
that
it
was
the
proper
thing
to
do.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
no
sir
it's
not
a
violation
of
the
rule
your
honor
because
the
rule
provides
that
the
judge
may
exclude
the
testimony,
it
does
not
say
he
cannot.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
i
think
that
the
--
they
are
both
the
same.
they
are
identical
except
for
the
defenses.
now,
the
names
of
the
defenses,
the
purpose
is
the
same.
if
one
is
going
to
plead
insanity,
he
should
be
required
to
give
notice
of
that
intent.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
well,
once
again
mr.
justice
black
i
think
this
court
has
decided
that
the
defendant
can
remain
absolutely
mute
and
say
nothing.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir,
he
could
remain
mute
under
the
situation
and
we've
had
cases
where
it's
been
done.
they
remained
mute
in
4325
versus
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
--
once
again
i'm
not
in
the
position
to
say
what
those
gentlemen
would
do.
i
don't
know
what
the
state
court
could
do
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
i
can
only
go
based
on
the
decision
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
i
assume
that
they
could
but
i
can
only
go
by
at
this
point
of
what
they
have
done
and
i
have
to
watch.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
no
sir,
i'm
not
saying
that.
i'm
saying
that
the
appellate
court
of
florida
have
--
when
they've
had
appeals
in
situations
like
this,
they
have
said
it
was
not
error
for
this
person
to
testify
and
the
trial
judge
properly
let
him
testify
under
the
provisions
of
the
rule
even
though
he
didn't
comply.
and
i
think
that
i've
been
simply
speculating
to
this
court,
if
i
said
that
they
would
rule
some
other
way
and
have
to
abide
by
the
precedence
that
they've
set
down
here.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
i
think
that
i
have
to
assume
at
this
point.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
i
can't
go
that
far
and
i
think
that
simply
back
myself
in
the
corner
and
never
get
out.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
sir?
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
i
did
--
it
very
well
may
your
honor
but
at
this
point
i
don't
think
that
this
is
the
question
before
this
court,
i
don't
not
understand
it
as
being
the
question
before
this
court.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
were
used.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir
and
if
we
talk
about
the
trial
strategy,
there
was
nothing
that
prohibited
the
defendant
from
testifying
in
his
own
behalf
if
he
wanted
to
at
any
time
during
the
trial.
what
we
are
really
talking
about
is
a
bit
of
timing.
now,
he
can
determine
at
the
close
of
the
state's
case
whether
he
wants
to
put
on
alibi
witnesses
or
he
can
determine
15
days
before
trial
that
he
does
not
--
that
he
wants
to
put
or
does
not
want
to
put
on
alibi
witnesses.
now,
the
way
it
harms
and
is
absolutely
(inaudible)
to
me
and
there
is
not
any
violation
anywhere
of
the
fifth
amendment
here
because
he
is
not
required
to
put
on
anybody
on
the
stand.
he
is
not
required
to
testify
or
not
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
it's
a
different
argument
but
mr.
justice
black
i
think
that
i
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
what
has
happened
here
is
that
defendant
did
comply
with
the
rule.
he
complied
with
the
rule.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
may
not
be.
the
non-compliance
is
not
a
issue
i
submit
to
the
court.
the
fact
is
that
he
did
comply
that
he
did
as
a
matter
of
trial
strategy
decide
to
put
on
his
alibi
witnesses.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
i
can't
--
mr.
justice
black
i
certainly
cannot
stand
here
and
say
that
i
can
make
up
counsel's
mind.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
just
like,
well
conclude
a
statement
to
the
question
given
before
the
court.
the
first
issue
is
that,
certainly
it's
not
incriminating,
what
might
have
happened
is
not
before
this
court
and
as
suggested
by
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
stewart
in
the
total
effect
over
here,
it
was
absolutely
harmless
to
the
defendant
to
have
those
witness
to
testify
where
he
complied
with
the
rule.
the
second
issue
is
raised
in
our
brief
is
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause
and
the
sixth
amendment
entitle
a
state
defendant
to
a
trial
of
12-men
jury.
first,
i
think
to
understand
or
towards
to
get
to
the
core
of
this
problem,
we
first
must
necessarily
talk
about
the
12-men
jury
of
a
purpose
of
the
jury
trial
as
defined
by
this
court's
decision
in
duncan
versus
louisiana.
i
think
the
majority
opinion
stated
that
the
purpose
of
the
jury
and
the
anglo-american
system
was
protection
against
arbitrary
power.
the
jury
of
a
pierce
gave
this
kind
of
safeguard
from
overzealous
prosecutor
and
overzealous
federal
and
state
governments.
secondly,
there
have
been
decisions
from
this
court,
says
that
the
federal
standard
only
requires
that
we
adhere
to
the
essentials
of
the
common
law
jury.
and
to
number
the
essentials,
we
think
that
the
essentials
are
one,
that
a
person's
needs
or
should
have
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
serious
offenses.
another
essential
of
the
jury
system
as
we
think
the
unanimous
verdict
as
defined
by
this
code
in
patton
versus
united
states
and
the
only
decisions
tend
to
say
maxwell
versus
dow
and
thompson
versus
utah
suggest
that
12
men
is
an
essential
of
the
jury
system.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
word
suggest
did
not
--
i
didn't
mean
suggest,
the
court
said
or
held,
but
they
were
only
applied
then
in
terms
of
the
federal
standard.
now,
we
have
to
look
at
what
are
the
essentials
of
the
jury
system.
(inaudible)
we
think
that
this
is
essential
because
of
the
possible
confinement.
unanimous
verdict
and
florida
complies
with
this
but
when
we
talk
about
the
12
men
jury,
there
is
nothing,
there's
no
particular
reason
for
having
12
men
on
a
jury
as
opposed
to
six
men.
we
find
that
the
common
law
or
the
reason
that
we
have
to
have
is
merely
a
carry
over
of
the
common
law
at
the
time
we
adopted
the
constitution
in
1789.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor,
the
state
of
florida
does
provide
for
12
men
juries
or
12
person
juries,
i
might
say
in
capital
offenses.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
i
truthfully
think
that
it
is
a
vestigial
remain
of
the
common
law,
that's
all
and
there's
nothing
more.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
there
is
a
line
drawing
in
the
12
versus
6
in
the
state
of
florida
and
the
capital
offenses
--
these
are
the
offenses
at
the
time
it
was
drawn
and
the
present
time
carry
with
it
a
death
penalty.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
of
florida
does
provide
for
12
man
jury
in
eminent
domain
cases
as
we've
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor,
i'm
not
familiar
with
any
place
where
there
is
less
than
12
on
a
capital
offense.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
i
think
there
would
be
sir.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
i
don't
know
where
we
can
draw
the
line
in
terms
of
the
numbers
gained
and
i
think
that
this
is
what
it
is,
it's
a
numbers
game.
i
look
at
it
to
say
a
jury
of
peers
which
would
suggest
to
me.
sir?
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
one
should
be
tried
by
a
jury
of
his
peers
which
was
suggested
to
me
the
plural
of
the
word
peers
would
mean
more
than
one.
historically
we
have
seen
and
i
think
it's
lost
in
history
that
sometimes
people
were
tried
by
500
as
have
been
suggested
today
or
down
to
as
many
as
three.
when
this
jury
system
was
developing
but
there
is
no
statistical
data
available
that
has
been
presented
by
the
petitioner
which
suggests
that
a
man
tried
by
12
is
going
to
receive
a
fairer
trial
than
a
man
who
was
tried
by
six.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
you
use
that
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall
you're
absolutely
correct
but
i
think
that
we
come
back
to
a
number's
game
and
this
court
is
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor,
if
we
took
to
this
to
the
logical
conclusion,
we
ought
to
have
the
population
of
washington
sitting
on
one
case.
so
long
as
we
provide,
as
this
court
said
in
the
jury
system
a
buffer
between
overzealous
prosecutors
or
overzealous
state
officials
and
we
provide
it
by
a
fair
and
impartial
manner,
i
think
that
this
is
all
that's
required
and
if
we
play
the
number's
games
i
would
suggest
that
we
shouldn't
use
12.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor,
my
research
does
not
reveal
that,
it
does
reveal
that
thompson
versus
utah,
before
they
were
a
state,
i
think
this
was
about
1898
decided
by
this
court
stated
that
thompson
wanted
to
be
tried
by
eight
people
or
some
number
less
than
12
and
the
court
said
--
that
the
state
of
utah,
not
the
state
but
the
territory
of
utah
could
not
do
this
because
they
were
on
the
federal
jurisdiction.
to
me,
the
dicta
sort
of
indicated
that
had
not,
they
had
been
on
the
federal
jurisdiction
that
he
would
have
been
allowed,
it
would
have
been
okay
to
try
him
by
a
people
or
by
a
number
less
than
12.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
the
state
of
utah
use
a
six
and
i
think
that
there
are
some
12
states
at
some
trial
proceedings
throughout
from
the
lowest
court
up
to
the
highest
trial
court
use
less
than
six
on
one
occasion
or
another,
i
mean
less
than
12
on
one
occasion
or
another.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
this
historically,
i
think
that
florida
might
have
gotten
this
rule
too.
in
its
legislative
history
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondent
would
like
to
respectfully
address
itself
to
the
issues
as
they
have
been
raised
in
our
brief.
the
first
issue
being,
do
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
fifth
amendment
privileges
against
self
incrimination
violated
by
requirement
that
a
defendant
disclosed
ten
days
prior
to
trial,
his
intent
to
rely
on
alibi
defenses.
first,
i
would
like
to
say
that
florida's
rule
of
notice
of
alibi
as
we
were
referring
to
it
is
fundamentally
fair
and
it's
not
unconstitutional.
the
rule
is
not
designed
in
any
way
for
a
defendant
to
say
anything
against
himself.
the
rule
is
a
rule
of
procedure.
now,
the
constitution,
it
do
not
think
does
not
grant
to
a
defendant
the
right
to
so
have
the
kind
of
defense,
so
that
the
state
cannot
check
the
veracity
of
that
defense
and
that's
what
he
is
suggesting
here.
all
that
the
constitution
or
all
that
we
profit
to
the
court
today
is
that
upon
a
written
demand
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
we
want
to
straighten
out
a
few
of
the
concessions
that
we
were
supposed
to
have
made
that
there
must
be
a
written
demand
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
first
to
a
defendant
asking
whether
or
not
he
intends
to
rely
on
an
alibi
defense.
if
he
so
does,
then
and
only
then
is
he
required
to
give
the
names
of
the
witnesses
as
are
known
to
him
who
will
testify
for
him.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
it's
necessary
during
a
time
when
we
are
trying
to
modernize
criminal
law
in
its
search
for
truth.
and
i
don't
think
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
think
it
is
because
if
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
it
helps
to
avoid
the
popping
up
of
phony
alibis.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
how
would
it?
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
because
if
the
state
has
an
opportunity
or
the
state
knows
of
the
witnesses
that
the
defendant
intends
to
use
as
an
alibi
and
the
alibi
statute
probably
states
that
if
alibi,
the
defendant
was
not
at
a
particular
place
at
a
particular
time,
therefore
he
could
not
have
permitted
the
crime.
it
gives
the
state
an
opportunity
then
if
nothing
else
to
know
a
price
or
to
dismiss
the
matter.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
i
think
that
you
are
correct
sir,
i
think
that
the
state
is
looking
to
find
out
the
truth
of
the
matter
whether
or
not
a
person
did
commit
a
crime.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
i
think
the
state
does
have
the
right
to
talk
to
those
witnesses.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
no
sir,
i
do
not.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
unethical
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
find
that
in
the
same
rule
that
the
state
does
provide
that
we
are
obligated
to
give
to
you
the
names
of
all
of
our
witnesses
and
we
are
under
continuing
obligation
to
give
to
the
defendant.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
this
is
not
the
rule.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
you
may
get
more
truth
your
honor.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
i
will
not
advocate
that
rule
to
the
court
today.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
you
honor,
i
don't
want
to
go
that
far
over
on
the
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
i
think
we
can
do
it
here
because
we
--
it's
an
attempt
to
modernize
and
it's
reciprocal
kind
of
discovery.
i
see
nothing
unconstitutional
about
it,
there
is
no
abridgement
of
his
right
to
remain
silent.
it
is
not
testimonial.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir
but
it
just
--
this
does
not
abridge
his
right
as
he
maintains
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
remain
silent.
when
we
look
at
the
rule,
the
rule
is,
it
is
absolutely
reasonable
and
constitutional.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
he
is
not
required
in
anyway
to
say
anything
that
will
incriminate
himself.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
about
the
crime
or
the
offense.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
about
the
trial.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
that
talking
about
the
witnesses
your
honor
has
anything
to
do
with
incriminating
him
or
it's
not
testimonial
to
the
extent
that
the
fifth
amendment
would
cover
that
situation.
i
think
that
all
he
is
doing
at
this
point
is
tendering
a
name,
the
names
of
witnesses
that
he
is
going
to
use
for
one
instance,
alibi.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
he
has
that
right.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
he
has
the
right
to
remain
silent
as
i
understand.
this
court's
decision
in
malloy
versus
hogan.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
he
has
the
unfettered
right
to
remain
silent
about
incrimination
and
what
he
gives
to
the
state
in
terms
of
witnesses
does
not
incriminate
him.
and
what
they
are
suggesting
to
us
is
that
we
ought
to
make
criminal
law.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
it
does
not
weaken
his
hands.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
very
valuable.
additionally,
i
think
it's
very
valuable
to
a
defendant
to
have
the
names
of
the
witnesses
that
the
state
will
use
to
rebut
this
testimony.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
sir?
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
state
of
florida
does
too.
i
would
suggest
to
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
i
don't
remember
anything
in
the
constitution
saying
that
i
--
as
we
discussed
this
i
am
reminded
of
schneider
versus
massachusetts
where
a
former
member
this
court
mr.
justice
cardoza
said
that
while
due
process
is
due
to
the
accuser
it
is
also
due
to
the
accused
and
that's
precisely
what
we
are
talking
about.
that
we
are
not
abridging
him
of
any
right
to
remain
silent
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
no
sir,
the
state
of
florida
does
not
concede
that
it's
testimonial.
what
i
think
we
are
talking
about
here
is
that
petitioner
is
probably
trying
to
make
criminal
law
like
a
poker
game
so
that
the
person
who
has
the
biggest
surprise
at
trial
then
should
win
and
probably
would
in
many
instances.
but
we
had
cases
in
this
court,
and
other
inferior
courts
probably
have
suggested
that
the
whole
purpose
of
trials
in
both
criminal
and
civil
proceedings
is
the
search
for
truth.
now,
we
are
not
suggesting
in
any
way
that
this
defendant
should
be
required
to
get
on
the
stand
or
not
to
get
on
the
stand.
we
are
simply
saying
that
if
you
intend
to
use
alibi
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor,
this
would
be
a
clear
violation
of
all
of
the
cases
that
this
court
have
decided,
if
we
forced
a
man
to
testify
and
we
are
not
suggesting
that.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
no
sir
it
does
not.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
i
respectfully
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
court,
mr.
justice
black
with
you
on
that
position.
it
does
not
in
my
opinion
require
him
to
testify
because
it
is
a
matter
of
timing.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
it
simply
requires
him
to
disclose
the
names
of
the
witnesses.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
for
alibi
alone.
this
is
all
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
then
i
suppose
they
could
do
it
about
everything
and
i
don't
think
i'm
in
a
position
to
discuss
the
constitutionality
of
that
principle
on
this
occasion.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
i
would
agree.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
under
this
rule
your
honor.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
he
does
not
have
to
give
any
information
that
would
incriminate
him
and
this
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
i
would
agree
your
honor.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
he
can
stand
mute.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor,
the
rule
--
if
the
rule
does
provide
that
he
can
stand
silent.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
no
the
rule
does
not
go
that
for
us
mr.
kanner
said.
the
rule
to
answer
mr.
justice
black's
question
specifically
provides
that
if
he
does
not
comply
with
the
rule,
the
trial
judge
may
exclude
the
testimony.
it
does
not
say
that
he
can
not
use
that.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
quite
agree,
i
think
that
the
same
court
that
decided
this
case,
the
third
district
court
of
appeal
is
mindful
of
this
and
we
cited
it
at
page
14
in
our
brief,
(inaudible)
versus
state
of
florida
and
wilson
versus
the
state
of
florida
where
the
defendant
did
not
comply
with
the
notice
of
alibi
rule
and
the
court
still
let
those
witnesses
testify
so
that
the
rule
is
not
an
un-reasonable
rule
where
we
say
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor,
i
have
to
assume
from
my
position
that
judges
are
fair
and
that
they
are
knowledgeable
and
reasonable
that
they
will
apply
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
oh!
no
sir.
i
am
certainly
not
saying
that.
i'm
simply
saying
that
the
florida
cases
have
been
decided
on
this
rule.
the
judge
has
allowed
the
alibi
witness
to
testify
even
where
the
defendant
in
some
instances
did
not
comply
with
the
request.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
he
thought
that
it
was
the
proper
thing
to
do.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
no
sir
it's
not
a
violation
of
the
rule
your
honor
because
the
rule
provides
that
the
judge
may
exclude
the
testimony,
it
does
not
say
he
cannot.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
i
think
that
the
--
they
are
both
the
same.
they
are
identical
except
for
the
defenses.
now,
the
names
of
the
defenses,
the
purpose
is
the
same.
if
one
is
going
to
plead
insanity,
he
should
be
required
to
give
notice
of
that
intent.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
well,
once
again
mr.
justice
black
i
think
this
court
has
decided
that
the
defendant
can
remain
absolutely
mute
and
say
nothing.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir,
he
could
remain
mute
under
the
situation
and
we've
had
cases
where
it's
been
done.
they
remained
mute
in
4325
versus
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
--
once
again
i'm
not
in
the
position
to
say
what
those
gentlemen
would
do.
i
don't
know
what
the
state
court
could
do
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
i
can
only
go
based
on
the
decision
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
i
assume
that
they
could
but
i
can
only
go
by
at
this
point
of
what
they
have
done
and
i
have
to
watch.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
no
sir,
i'm
not
saying
that.
i'm
saying
that
the
appellate
court
of
florida
have
--
when
they've
had
appeals
in
situations
like
this,
they
have
said
it
was
not
error
for
this
person
to
testify
and
the
trial
judge
properly
let
him
testify
under
the
provisions
of
the
rule
even
though
he
didn't
comply.
and
i
think
that
i've
been
simply
speculating
to
this
court,
if
i
said
that
they
would
rule
some
other
way
and
have
to
abide
by
the
precedence
that
they've
set
down
here.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
i
think
that
i
have
to
assume
at
this
point.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
i
can't
go
that
far
and
i
think
that
simply
back
myself
in
the
corner
and
never
get
out.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
sir?
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
i
did
--
it
very
well
may
your
honor
but
at
this
point
i
don't
think
that
this
is
the
question
before
this
court,
i
don't
not
understand
it
as
being
the
question
before
this
court.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
were
used.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir
and
if
we
talk
about
the
trial
strategy,
there
was
nothing
that
prohibited
the
defendant
from
testifying
in
his
own
behalf
if
he
wanted
to
at
any
time
during
the
trial.
what
we
are
really
talking
about
is
a
bit
of
timing.
now,
he
can
determine
at
the
close
of
the
state's
case
whether
he
wants
to
put
on
alibi
witnesses
or
he
can
determine
15
days
before
trial
that
he
does
not
--
that
he
wants
to
put
or
does
not
want
to
put
on
alibi
witnesses.
now,
the
way
it
harms
and
is
absolutely
(inaudible)
to
me
and
there
is
not
any
violation
anywhere
of
the
fifth
amendment
here
because
he
is
not
required
to
put
on
anybody
on
the
stand.
he
is
not
required
to
testify
or
not
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
it's
a
different
argument
but
mr.
justice
black
i
think
that
i
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
what
has
happened
here
is
that
defendant
did
comply
with
the
rule.
he
complied
with
the
rule.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
may
not
be.
the
non-compliance
is
not
a
issue
i
submit
to
the
court.
the
fact
is
that
he
did
comply
that
he
did
as
a
matter
of
trial
strategy
decide
to
put
on
his
alibi
witnesses.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
i
can't
--
mr.
justice
black
i
certainly
cannot
stand
here
and
say
that
i
can
make
up
counsel's
mind.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
just
like,
well
conclude
a
statement
to
the
question
given
before
the
court.
the
first
issue
is
that,
certainly
it's
not
incriminating,
what
might
have
happened
is
not
before
this
court
and
as
suggested
by
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
stewart
in
the
total
effect
over
here,
it
was
absolutely
harmless
to
the
defendant
to
have
those
witness
to
testify
where
he
complied
with
the
rule.
the
second
issue
is
raised
in
our
brief
is
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause
and
the
sixth
amendment
entitle
a
state
defendant
to
a
trial
of
12-men
jury.
first,
i
think
to
understand
or
towards
to
get
to
the
core
of
this
problem,
we
first
must
necessarily
talk
about
the
12-men
jury
of
a
purpose
of
the
jury
trial
as
defined
by
this
court's
decision
in
duncan
versus
louisiana.
i
think
the
majority
opinion
stated
that
the
purpose
of
the
jury
and
the
anglo-american
system
was
protection
against
arbitrary
power.
the
jury
of
a
pierce
gave
this
kind
of
safeguard
from
overzealous
prosecutor
and
overzealous
federal
and
state
governments.
secondly,
there
have
been
decisions
from
this
court,
says
that
the
federal
standard
only
requires
that
we
adhere
to
the
essentials
of
the
common
law
jury.
and
to
number
the
essentials,
we
think
that
the
essentials
are
one,
that
a
person's
needs
or
should
have
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
serious
offenses.
another
essential
of
the
jury
system
as
we
think
the
unanimous
verdict
as
defined
by
this
code
in
patton
versus
united
states
and
the
only
decisions
tend
to
say
maxwell
versus
dow
and
thompson
versus
utah
suggest
that
12
men
is
an
essential
of
the
jury
system.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
word
suggest
did
not
--
i
didn't
mean
suggest,
the
court
said
or
held,
but
they
were
only
applied
then
in
terms
of
the
federal
standard.
now,
we
have
to
look
at
what
are
the
essentials
of
the
jury
system.
(inaudible)
we
think
that
this
is
essential
because
of
the
possible
confinement.
unanimous
verdict
and
florida
complies
with
this
but
when
we
talk
about
the
12
men
jury,
there
is
nothing,
there's
no
particular
reason
for
having
12
men
on
a
jury
as
opposed
to
six
men.
we
find
that
the
common
law
or
the
reason
that
we
have
to
have
is
merely
a
carry
over
of
the
common
law
at
the
time
we
adopted
the
constitution
in
1789.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor,
the
state
of
florida
does
provide
for
12
men
juries
or
12
person
juries,
i
might
say
in
capital
offenses.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
i
truthfully
think
that
it
is
a
vestigial
remain
of
the
common
law,
that's
all
and
there's
nothing
more.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
there
is
a
line
drawing
in
the
12
versus
6
in
the
state
of
florida
and
the
capital
offenses
--
these
are
the
offenses
at
the
time
it
was
drawn
and
the
present
time
carry
with
it
a
death
penalty.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
of
florida
does
provide
for
12
man
jury
in
eminent
domain
cases
as
we've
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor,
i'm
not
familiar
with
any
place
where
there
is
less
than
12
on
a
capital
offense.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
i
think
there
would
be
sir.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
i
don't
know
where
we
can
draw
the
line
in
terms
of
the
numbers
gained
and
i
think
that
this
is
what
it
is,
it's
a
numbers
game.
i
look
at
it
to
say
a
jury
of
peers
which
would
suggest
to
me.
sir?
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
one
should
be
tried
by
a
jury
of
his
peers
which
was
suggested
to
me
the
plural
of
the
word
peers
would
mean
more
than
one.
historically
we
have
seen
and
i
think
it's
lost
in
history
that
sometimes
people
were
tried
by
500
as
have
been
suggested
today
or
down
to
as
many
as
three.
when
this
jury
system
was
developing
but
there
is
no
statistical
data
available
that
has
been
presented
by
the
petitioner
which
suggests
that
a
man
tried
by
12
is
going
to
receive
a
fairer
trial
than
a
man
who
was
tried
by
six.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
you
use
that
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall
you're
absolutely
correct
but
i
think
that
we
come
back
to
a
number's
game
and
this
court
is
--
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor,
if
we
took
to
this
to
the
logical
conclusion,
we
ought
to
have
the
population
of
washington
sitting
on
one
case.
so
long
as
we
provide,
as
this
court
said
in
the
jury
system
a
buffer
between
overzealous
prosecutors
or
overzealous
state
officials
and
we
provide
it
by
a
fair
and
impartial
manner,
i
think
that
this
is
all
that's
required
and
if
we
play
the
number's
games
i
would
suggest
that
we
shouldn't
use
12.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor,
my
research
does
not
reveal
that,
it
does
reveal
that
thompson
versus
utah,
before
they
were
a
state,
i
think
this
was
about
1898
decided
by
this
court
stated
that
thompson
wanted
to
be
tried
by
eight
people
or
some
number
less
than
12
and
the
court
said
--
that
the
state
of
utah,
not
the
state
but
the
territory
of
utah
could
not
do
this
because
they
were
on
the
federal
jurisdiction.
to
me,
the
dicta
sort
of
indicated
that
had
not,
they
had
been
on
the
federal
jurisdiction
that
he
would
have
been
allowed,
it
would
have
been
okay
to
try
him
by
a
people
or
by
a
number
less
than
12.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
the
state
of
utah
use
a
six
and
i
think
that
there
are
some
12
states
at
some
trial
proceedings
throughout
from
the
lowest
court
up
to
the
highest
trial
court
use
less
than
six
on
one
occasion
or
another,
i
mean
less
than
12
on
one
occasion
or
another.
mr.
jesse
j.
mccrary,
jr.
your
honor
this
historically,
i
think
that
florida
might
have
gotten
this
rule
too.
in
its
legislative
history
--
