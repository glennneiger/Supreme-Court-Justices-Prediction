justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
kanner,
assume
a
case
where
the
defendant
never
talks
to
anybody,
police
or
anybody
else
and
does
not
testify
at
the
trial.
how
do
you
get
that
under
the
firth
amendment
witness
word?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
has
never
been
a
witness
by
this.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
has
never
been
a
witness
earlier.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
the
only
one
he
can
put
the
claim
on
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
he
is
there
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
once
he
is
done
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
does
the
court
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
assumes
that
a
prosecutor
will
say
it
and
that
a
judge
will
let
him
say
it
and
that
the
state
court
rule
have
said
it.
that's
four
assumptions.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
which
side
do
you
argue?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
the
state
has
the
right
to
talk
to
those
witnesses?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
think
it's
unethical?
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
a
lawyer
to
talk
to
the
witness
on
the
other
side?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
would
you
say
that
a
rule
of
the
florida
that
a
defendant
must
15
days
before
trial
divulge
the
name
and
address
of
every
witness
he
intends
to
use?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
agree
but
would
that
rule
be
alright
when
you
get
more
truth,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
wouldn't
call
us
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
don't
think
it
will
stand
up
either,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
prefer
to
stick
with
the
alabama.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
real
problem
i
have
with
the
graph
is
that
do
you
agree
that
in
that
stage,
florida
has
no
right
to
ask
him
and
require
him
to
answer
anything
other
than
his
alibi
witnesses.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
the
alibi
would?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
under
all
the
decisions
of
this
court,
he
doesn't
have
to
tell
you
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
doesn't
have
to
tell
you
anything
either
he
not
to
give
you
his
name.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
can
stand
absolutely
silent.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
on
this
one
question
he
can't
stand
silent.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
can't
use
an
alibi?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
a
jury
of
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
it
true
that
if
you
have
12
jurors
as
compared
to
6
you
lose
opportunity
of
six,
one
votes
for
hung
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
have
12,
you
already
had
convinced
one
out
of
12
to
get
a
hung
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
you
have
six,
you
only
six
chances
to
find
that
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
it
would
be
better
to
have
25
under
my
theory.
justice
thurgood
