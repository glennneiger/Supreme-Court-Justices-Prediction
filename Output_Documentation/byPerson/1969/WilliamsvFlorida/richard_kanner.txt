mr.
richard
kanner
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
i
please
the
court.
known
as
this
case
involves
the
validity
of
the
florida
procedural
requiring
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
to
on
proper
notice
to
give
the
prosecuting
attorney
the
names
and
addresses
of
any
alibi
witnesses
which
the
defendant
might
use.
your
honors,
the
case
also
involves
the
validity
of
florida
six-men
criminal
trial
jury.
the
facts
are
not
in
the
list
of
dispute,
they
are
reflected
both
in
my
brief
and
in
the
state's
brief
without
any
dispute.
i
will
not
dwell
on
them
here
other
than
to
note
the
state
apparently
acknowledges
that
the
questions
were
properly
raised
and
preserved
below
and
that
the
state
apparently
acknowledges
now
that
to
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
applied
to
the
state.
your
honors,
i
will
discuss
the
interpretation
of
the
terms
witness,
compulsion
and
against
himself
in
discussing
the
fifth
amendment
right.
and
i
will
also
discuss
reasons
why
your
honors
in
my
opinion
the
number
12
is
fundamental
to
the
jury
system
in
this
country.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
we
have
a
procedural
rule
which
is
the
same
affect
as
a
statute
which
when
i
offer
to
disclose
all
of
my
witnesses,
the
state
is
then
required
to
disclose
all
of
their
witnesses.
mr.
richard
kanner
it
is
conditionally
your
honor
on
that
i
have.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
your
honor.
we
have
another
statute
that
is
not
conditional
your
honor
that
the
state
without
any
conditional
on
my
part
must
disclose
the
name
of
their
witness
upon
whom
the
information
is
based
as
distinguished
from
their
witnesses
on
the
case.
mr.
richard
kanner
presumably
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor,
the
statutes
in
florida
provide
for
indictment
on
capital
cases.
on
non
capital
cases
your
honor
the
prosecuting
officials
have
the
right
to
proceed
by
either
information
or
at
least
has
been
in
my
experience
in
solitary
cases,
even
in
misdemeanors
sometimes
that
they
are
proceeded
on
by
indictment
but
this
is
strictly
up
to
the
prosecuting
authorities.
your
honors,
the
fifth
amendment
is
historically
simple.
no
person
shall
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
your
honors,
whatever
this
prohibition
means
and
i'm
going
to
get
to
this
in
a
minute.
this
prohibition
your
honor
is
utterly
and
completely
without
qualification
or
exemption,
absolutely.
this
prohibition,
the
fifth
amendment
is
absolutely,
positively
never
ever,
ever
subject
to
competing
public
interest
regardless
of
how
vast
this
public
interest
might
take.
mr.
richard
kanner
alibi.
mr.
richard
kanner
i
mean
mr.
chief
justice,
the
fifth
amendment
says
this,
the
cases
of
this
court
i
think
of
which
i've
cited
in
my
brief.
mr.
richard
kanner
only
the
scope
that
this
court
has
given
it
your
honor
because
the
state
has
argued
in
its
brief
that
the
reason
for
the
alibi
rule
is
to
combat
perjury.
the
reason
for
the
alibi
ruling
your
honors
is
in
a
quest
for
the
search
for
truth.
in
arguendo
your
honors,
i
concede
all
of
this
absolutely
for
the
sake
of
this
argument.
i
would
also
concede
your
honors
if
they
would
ask
and
without
being
utterly
facetious
about
it
that
the
alibi
rule
would
stop
pollution
and
stop
the
war
and
anything
else
because
your
honors,
i
think
not
subject
to
reasonable
question
that
whatever
comes
within
the
scope
of
the
fifth
amendment
it
is
not
subject
to
competing
state
interest.
the
state
has
not
been
able
to
show
a
solitary
case
which
came
within
the
fifth
amendment
that
this
court
or
any
other
court
has
said
or
at
least
that
this
court
has
said,
well
even
though
this
comes
within
the
fifth
amendment,
the
rights
of
the
state
in
this
context
are
so
great
that
we
are
not
going
to
bring
it
out
of
the
fifth
amendment.
your
honors,
i
suggested
in
my
brief
or
at
least
cited
in
my
brief
an
early
case
boyd
versus
united
states
which
had
to
do
with
the
forfeiture
of
goods
but
in
the
--
and
boyd,
this
court
quoted
from
an
english
trespass
case
and
there
the
english
justice
noted
that
trespass
in
a
single
nature
is
just
absolute.
and
i
suggest
that
at
least
whatever
the
fifth
amendment
says
it's
true
here,
that
as
the
english
case
said.
if
you're
going
to
have
an
invasion
of
this
privilege,
you
have
got
to
go
back
to
the
common
law
principles
and
find
some
justification
for
it
and
that
the
silence
of
the
books
according
to
the
english
justice
is
authority
against
the
invasion.
the
state
is
not
been
able
to
cite
a
solitary
case
of
this
court
or
any
case
in
principle
in
history
which
would
sanction
the
use
of
an
alibi
witness.
the
fact
i
note
parenthetically
that
the
alibi
witness
rule
has
been
proposed
twice
in
the
federal
rules
and
rejected
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is
determinative
of
all.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
your
honor
i'm
going
to
discuss
--
mr.
richard
kanner
i
agree,
i
believe
i've
cited
them
in
my
brief
but
i'm
going
to
discuss
now
the
interpretation
of
these
words
in
the
fifth
amendment
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
yourself
and
let's
see
what
these
words
mean.
let's
take
the
first
one
which
i
think
is
easiest
and
that
is
witness.
i
believe
your
honor
is
that
the
state
concedes
that
this
alibi
and
notice
rules
falls
within
the
term
'witness'
and
i
think
they
correctly
concede
that.
while
they
cite
in
their
brief
some
of
the
physical
test
cases
schmerber
versus
california
the
blood
alcohol
test,
i
believe
there
they
might
not
cite
the
finger
print
test
cases.
all
going
outside
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
properly
so,
is
i
understand
the
rationale
of
those
cases.
the
court
said
the
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
related
solely
to
communications
and
that
the
physical
test
not
being
communications
or
not
being
documents
or
not
within
fifth
amendment
and
i
only
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
rationale
should
not
be
expanded
today
because
since
the
state
apparently
concedes
that
the
notice
of
alibi
rule
is
within
the
purview
or
the
category
of
witness,
let's
leave
it
at
that.
i
know
that
one
case
that
i
cited
in
my
brief
albertson
versus
subversive
activities
control
board
which
was
the
case
which
this
court
said
the
communist
need
not
register.
now,
this
is
the
same
thing,
the
mere
fact
that
it's
a
document,
a
pleading
prior
to
trial
by
counsel
should
not
take
this
court
out
of
the
term
or
this
case
rather
out
of
the
term
of
witness.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
that's
--
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor,
the
fifth
amendment
doesn't
say
incriminatory
your
honor.
the
fifth
amendment
says
no
person
shall
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
this
is
position
that
the
state
takes.
the
state
says
this,
that
the
alibi
notice
rule
is
not
incriminating
but
its
exonerating.
mr.
richard
kanner
you're
going
to
bring
this
witness
into
trial
to
help
you
anyway
and
the
mere
acceleration
of
the
disclosure
of
notifying
the
state
attorney
is
to
when
this
witness
is
going
to
come
in
can
only
exonerate
you.
well
your
honors
as
i
reach
the
case
--
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
kanner
the
state
says
this
--
mr.
richard
kanner
the
defendant
is
never
going
to
witness,
the
state
--
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor,
the
state
says
this
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
marshall.
they
say
that
should
defendant
give
the
name
of
my
witnesses
prior
to
trial
to
the
prosecuting
attorney
is
according
to
the
procedural
rule
that
no
notice
can
be
ever
be
given
to
the
jury
by
way
of
opening
or
closing
argument
that
here,
the
defendant
supplied
the
state
with
the
names
of
the
alibi
witnesses,
where
are
those
alibi
witnesses?
your
honor,
the
defendant
says
or
rather
the
state
says
that
there
can
be
no
argument
like
that
to
the
jury.
they
have
not
cited
any
cases
and
i
have
not
found
the
first
case
your
honor
which
would
support
their
contention
that
should
i
comply
with
the
statute
that
this
alibi
witness
will
not
become
known
to
the
jury.
and
i
believe
your
honor
that
that
is
a
context.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
no
your
honor,
it
was
not
done
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
kanner
we
only
suggest
this
is
what
the
--
mr.
richard
kanner
no
your
honor,
i'm
suggesting
mr.
justice
marshall
that
in
answer
to
your
question,
if
the
defendant
would
not
testify,
how
the
alibi
notice
rule
would
be
a
witness.
i'm
only
trying
to
suggest
a
possibility
that
the
state
in
arguing
opening
and
closing
argument
to
the
jury
will
announce
to
the
jury
that
the
defendant
has
an
alibi.
we
do
not
believe
that
this
alibi
is
proper.
this
the
only
--
mr.
richard
kanner
these
assumptions
made
by
the
state
in
its
brief
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
i'm
arguing
my
side
your
honor
that
the
only
possible
way
that
the
witness
rule
can
apply
is
if
the
defendant
does
not
testify
as
in
the
context
that
i
have
suggested.
that
is
the
state
apparently
it
concedes
in
its
brief
that
the
alibi
notice
rule
comes
within
the
purview
of
witness
at
least
as
i
understand
their
brief.
mr.
richard
kanner
no
your
honor
but
i
only
suggest
the
--
regardless
of
whether
their
brief
buying
support,
i
only
suggest
that
in
the
communist
case
and
then
schmerber
versus
california,
this
court
held
that
witnesses
mean
anything
communication
and
i
feel
that
the
alibi
notice
rule
is
a
communication
within
the
fifth
amendment
scope
of
a
witness.
mr.
richard
kanner
our
only
alibi.
mr.
richard
kanner
no
--
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
as
i
read
the
cases.
i
--
or
at
least
i
as
counsel
have
the
sole
right
of
the
determining
when
i
am
going
to
make
this
judgment
as
to
what
to
put
forth
by
alibi
witness.
mr.
richard
kanner
as
i
read
the
cases
that
i've
cited
in
my
brief
--
mr.
richard
kanner
no!
schmerber
only
says
that,
what
is
a
witness,
i
didn't
cite
schmerber,
as
i
read
the
case
--
mr.
richard
kanner
those
words
may
have
been
used
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor,
i
have
possibly
used
the
term
testimonial
and
communicative
synonymously.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
it's
--
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor,
the
test
as
i
read
the
cases
your
honors
is
not
whether
the
disclosure
is
incriminating.
as
i
read
the
cases
your
honor,
the
test
is
whether
this
evidence
is
going
to
be
used
or
whether
this
information
can
be
used
by
the
state
at
trial.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
i
feel
that
cases
here
bring
the
notice
of
alibi
statute
within
the
term
witness.
i
feel
that
it
brings
the
language
--
the
cases
that
i
cited
brings
the
notice
of
alibi
rule
within
the
language
witness
against
himself
because
as
i
read
particularly
like
garrity
versus
new
jersey,
brown
versus
walker
that
the
defendant's
absolute
right
to
remain
silent
and
the
test
of
against
himself
at
least
as
i
read
the
cases
is
not
whether
it
is
incriminating.
true
that
in
most
all
instances
or
every
instance
that
i'm
aware
of,
the
rational
has
been
that
the
testimony
of
the
communication
was
incriminating
but
i
don't
read
the
fifth
amendment
like
that
as
you
--
as
i
read
the
fifth
amendment
and
as
i
read
the
cases
without
taking
things
out
of
context,
the
test
of
against
himself
is
whether
evidence
from
the
defendant's
own
lips
is
to
be
used
against
him
at
his
trial.
garrity
versus
new
jersey
as
i
recollect
was
a
case
where
some
policeman
testified
at
the
civil
service
area
and
then
this
evidence
was
used
in
their
trial.
well
the
record
doesn't
disclose
your
honor
but
theoretically
these
policeman
would
not
have
testified
at
the
civil
service
hearing
anything
but
what
they
thought
would
have
exonerated.
so
i
don't
feel
your
honors
that
the
test
of
against
himself
is
necessarily
incriminating
and
it
maybe
--
mr.
richard
kanner
not
in
the
list
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
kanner
not
in
the
list
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
kanner
well,
i
believe
that
the
state
is
conceded
that
it's
testimonial.
i
think
the
state
says
though
that
is
not
compulsion
and
the
reason
that
they
say
that
it's
not
compulsion,
i
believe
it
was
even
the
chief
justice
raised
or
maybe
justice
marshall
raised
the
question
that
since
this
alibi
witness
is
going
to
be
used
to
trial
anyway,
there's
no
compulsion
about
it
and
my
answer
to
this
your
honor
is
quite
simply
that
i
believe
that
i
as
counsel
have
got
the
absolute
positive
right
to
wait
until
the
conclusion
of
the
state's
case
before
i
want
to
make
a
decision
is
to
whether
i
wish
to
put
an
alibi
witness
on.
we
have
without
a
doubt.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
believe
that
the
fifth
amendment
requires
that
i
be
injured.
i
don't
believe
that
the
fifth
amendment
requires
that
i
incriminate
myself.
i
believe
that
the
fifth
amendment
says
that
i
cannot
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
myself
and
i
believe
that
your
point
is
certainly
the
most
difficult
that
i
have
to
overcome
that
is
what
is
the
test
of
“against
himself.”
i
believe
that
that
is
the
strongest
argument
that
the
state
has,
that
this
is
really
not
against
himself.
and
the
only
answer
that
i
have
to
this
your
honor
is
i
feel
that
i
have
an
absolute
right
to
remain
silent
up
until
the
very
close
of
the
state's
case
that
there
are
factors
that
are
going
to
be
apparent
only
at
trial
even
the
composition
of
the
jury
that
i'm
going
to
base
my
decision
on.
there
may
not
be
anything
incriminating
and
i
believe
the
analogy
is
reasonable
if
we
uphold
the
alibi-notice-rule,
the
state
can
come
back
and
say
ask
that
question
of
the
defendant
by
a
procedural
rule,
are
you
going
to
testify?
well,
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
any
question
about
that
as
being
invalid.
i
believe
that
we
uphold
the
alibi
notice
rule.
the
state
can
come
back
with
a
procedural
rule,
give
me
the
names
of
your
character
witnesses
if
you're
going
to
use
them.
mr.
richard
kanner
not
quite
mr.
justice
but
almost.
the
only
criminal
discovery
that
i
would
sanction
and
against
the
defendant
is
the
notice
of
insanity
and
the
reason
that
i
would
--
i
believe
that
the
notice
of
insanity
rule
is
good.
notice
of
insanity
is
very
similar
to
the
alibi
in
florida
and
i
believe
it's
predominant
through
out
the
state.
if
the
defendant
is
going
to
rely
on
insanity,
he
advices
the
state
a
certain
amount
of
days
before
trial
with
the
names
of
his
witnesses.
but
there
your
honors,
there
is
always
a
presumption
of
sanity
and
once
you
file
a
show
that
you
are
insane,
this
gives
the
state
an
additional
burden
of
proof
other
than
the
facts
that
are
in
the
information.
well
of
course
the
alibi-notice-rule
does
not.
so
mr.
justice,
in
answer
to
your
question,
the
notice
of
insanity
rule
is
the
only
criminal
discovery
that
i
as
a
trial
attorney
would
allow.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
black,
the
statute
provides
that
the
alibi
witness
cannot
testify,
the
defendant
himself
in
florida
can
testify
at
all
times
as
also
provision
in
the
rule
that
the
judge
if
the
circumstance
is
warranted
can
excuse
the
defendant
from
the
provisions
of
the
alibi
notice.
mr.
richard
kanner
well,
your
honor
we
are
getting
into
the
sixth
amendment
right
here
which
i
noticed
in
my
brief
of
washington
versus
texas
and
i'd
like
to
only
make
this
comment
that
i
raised
the
point
and
i
suggested
in
my
brief
washington
versus
texas
which
was
a
case
which
a
defendant
try
to
subpoena
a
co-defendant
who
was
not
on
trial
and
the
texas
procedure
apparently
was
that
the
co-defendant
could
not
testify.
i
am
going
to
answer
your
question
your
honor.
this
court
held
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
of
compulsory
attendance
of
witnesses
was
inapplicable
to
the
states.
your
honor,
i
did
not
specifically
raise
the
sixth
amendment
during
trial
but
i
have
always
relied
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
i
suggest
only
that
this
sixth
amendment
right
in
the
context
your
honors
that
i
presented
it
here
today
is
similar
to
our
fifth
amendment
right
against
self
incrimination.
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice,
the
law
of
the
procedural
rule
in
florida
is
clear
that
should
there
not
be
notice
given,
the
defendant
or
the
witness
rather
is
not
a
confident
witness
at
trial
unless
the
judge
within
the
exercise
of
his
own
discretion
--
mr.
richard
kanner
no
your
honor
because
i
complied
--
i
received
the
notice
of
alibi
form,
i
move
for
a
protected
order
on
the
fifth
amendment
on
grounds
and
also
the
florida
declaration
rights
ground
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
my
motion
for
protective
order
was
denied
which
is
how
this
case
got
here.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor,
we
get
down
here
to
the
--
i
see
here
that
my
time
is
about
running
out,
i'm
going
to
answer
your
question
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
your
honor
and
i
want
to
take
five
to
argue
the
jury
point.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honors
my
initial
reaction
on
the
jury
point
was
that
florida
being
spanish
domain,
our
six-man
jury
came
from
that.
in
the
words
of
the
vernacular
your
honor
suggests
isn't
so.
my
research
that
there
are
four
states
with
less
than
12
man
juries,
of
the
four
your
honor,
only
utah
has
had
a
six-man
jury
from
the
inception.
south
carolina
in
its
1776
constitutional
and
up
to
1865
had
12
man
juries.
florida
had
--
andrew
jackson's
first
order
when
he
was
territorial
government
said
that
all
criminal
cases
shall
be
tried
in
accordance
to
the
principles
of
the
common
law.
louisiana
your
honor,
there's
a
specific
federal
statute
when
louisiana
was
admitted
to
a
territory
that
said
all
criminal
cases
there
shall
be
a
jury
of
12.
so
your
honors,
i
feel
that
the
number
12
whether
it's
good
or
bad
regardless
the
number
12
your
honors
is
sufficient
and
rather
as
fundamental
to
our
jury
system.
your
honors
i
only
suggest
--
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
richard
kanner
i
did
in
--
during
this
period
of
time
while
this
case
was
pending.
i
did
a
great
deal
of
reading
to
try
and
answer
your
question
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
anywhere
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honors
as
i
read
it,
the
jury
was
always
12
or
more
and
that
the
reason,
the
12
came
out
--
mr.
richard
kanner
that
at
least
to
the
common
law
mr.
justice
that
at
least
12
persons
had
to
agree
and
if
they
couldn't
get
12
persons
to
agree
they
--
throughout
some
of
the
juries
and
they
brought
in
some
more
juries
and
held
12
could
agree.
i
believe
that
at
least
historically
is
how
i
read
it
but
i
don't
know
the
number
of
12.
your
honor
i
only
suggest
here
that
the
bill
of
rights
were
enacted
not
to
protect
the
guilty
or
rather
to
protect
the
innocent
but
rather
they
were
made
by
our
founders
to
protect
the
innocent
and
that
the
reasons
which
dictated
the
bill
of
rights
200
years
ago,
that
is
that
all
governments
want
to
get
rid
of
all
trouble
makers
as
quickly
as
possible
is
certainly
is
true
today
as
it
was
way
back
then.
and
your
honors
the
bill
or
rights
being
to
protect
the
guilty
and
to
shield
the
guilty
from
the
powers
of
the
state,
i
feel
that
it's
incumbent
on
this
court
to
read
them
in
the
manner
in
which
they
were
written.
and
then
answer
to
one
of
the
--
i
guess
--
one
of
the
justices,
there
is
no
criminal
discovery
in
a
--
against
to
the
defendant
unless
we're
going
to
change
the
literal
terms
of
the
fifth
amendment
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
mr.
richard
kanner
sir,
it
first
appears
under
constitution
of
1875
by
constitutional
amendment.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir.
we
suggest
that
in
our
brief
we
put
in
our
brief
joined
mr.
justice
harlan's
words
that
there's
nothing
significant
about
the
number
12
that
we've
come
to
get
this
number
based
on
the
anti-establishment
clause
that
its
basic
reference
comes
from
the
bible,
12
disciples
to
12
stones
to
12
tribes
of
israel
to
12
gates
to
jerusalem,
all
and
there's
nothing
significant
about
it.
and
that
six
people
can
provide
what
mr.
justice
white
did
say
that
we
put
to
provide
a
buffer
between
government
and
the
people
so
that
this
kind
of
a
pressure
is
not
put
on
people
by
overzealous
prosecutors
or
overzealous
government.
there
have
been
some
statistical
study
shown
in
winchester
massachusetts
district
court,
the
legislature
authorized
there
six-men
jury
and
the
report
said
that
it's
been
found
the
six
member
juries
render
the
same
kinds
of
verdicts
that
12
member
juries
render
or
their
render
the
same
kind
of
lawyers
would
expect
from
12-men
juries.
it
was
also
found
true
to
be
--
this
to
be
true
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
to
quote
mr.
justice
holmes
in
our
position,
he
says
that
it
is
revolting
that
we
have
no
better
reason
for
keeping
a
rule
than
that
rule
was
laid
down
in
the
time
of
henry
iv.
he
says
that
it's
more
revolting
as
the
grounds
upon
which
it
was
laid
down
long
vanished
and
the
rule
persist
from
the
blind
imitation
of
the
past.
we
think
that
the
12
men
jury
should
not
be
required
on
the
states,
additionally
we
think
that
the
numbers
game
is
not
essential
to
fulfilling
the
purpose
that
this
court
pronounced
in
duncan
versus
the
united
--
versus
louisiana
and
that
the
sole
purpose
of
the
jury
is
to
protect
the
public
and
whether
that
number
is
six
or
12,
it
is
fulfilled
and
that
there
is
nothing
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
the
sixth
amendment
when
you
use
six
men
on
a
jury
trial.
we
respectfully
urge
this
court
on
both
issues
to
affirm
the
district
court
of
appeal
and
to
hold
particularly
that
a
six
men
jury
does
not
violate
the
constitution
and
the
notice
of
alibi
does
not
violate
the
fifth
amendment
nor
the
due
process
clause
of
the
united
state
constitution.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
unless
the
court
has
any
question,
i
have
no
further
argument.
mr.
richard
kanner
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
i
please
the
court.
known
as
this
case
involves
the
validity
of
the
florida
procedural
requiring
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
to
on
proper
notice
to
give
the
prosecuting
attorney
the
names
and
addresses
of
any
alibi
witnesses
which
the
defendant
might
use.
your
honors,
the
case
also
involves
the
validity
of
florida
six-men
criminal
trial
jury.
the
facts
are
not
in
the
list
of
dispute,
they
are
reflected
both
in
my
brief
and
in
the
state's
brief
without
any
dispute.
i
will
not
dwell
on
them
here
other
than
to
note
the
state
apparently
acknowledges
that
the
questions
were
properly
raised
and
preserved
below
and
that
the
state
apparently
acknowledges
now
that
to
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
applied
to
the
state.
your
honors,
i
will
discuss
the
interpretation
of
the
terms
witness,
compulsion
and
against
himself
in
discussing
the
fifth
amendment
right.
and
i
will
also
discuss
reasons
why
your
honors
in
my
opinion
the
number
12
is
fundamental
to
the
jury
system
in
this
country.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
we
have
a
procedural
rule
which
is
the
same
affect
as
a
statute
which
when
i
offer
to
disclose
all
of
my
witnesses,
the
state
is
then
required
to
disclose
all
of
their
witnesses.
mr.
richard
kanner
it
is
conditionally
your
honor
on
that
i
have.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
your
honor.
we
have
another
statute
that
is
not
conditional
your
honor
that
the
state
without
any
conditional
on
my
part
must
disclose
the
name
of
their
witness
upon
whom
the
information
is
based
as
distinguished
from
their
witnesses
on
the
case.
mr.
richard
kanner
presumably
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor,
the
statutes
in
florida
provide
for
indictment
on
capital
cases.
on
non
capital
cases
your
honor
the
prosecuting
officials
have
the
right
to
proceed
by
either
information
or
at
least
has
been
in
my
experience
in
solitary
cases,
even
in
misdemeanors
sometimes
that
they
are
proceeded
on
by
indictment
but
this
is
strictly
up
to
the
prosecuting
authorities.
your
honors,
the
fifth
amendment
is
historically
simple.
no
person
shall
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
your
honors,
whatever
this
prohibition
means
and
i'm
going
to
get
to
this
in
a
minute.
this
prohibition
your
honor
is
utterly
and
completely
without
qualification
or
exemption,
absolutely.
this
prohibition,
the
fifth
amendment
is
absolutely,
positively
never
ever,
ever
subject
to
competing
public
interest
regardless
of
how
vast
this
public
interest
might
take.
mr.
richard
kanner
alibi.
mr.
richard
kanner
i
mean
mr.
chief
justice,
the
fifth
amendment
says
this,
the
cases
of
this
court
i
think
of
which
i've
cited
in
my
brief.
mr.
richard
kanner
only
the
scope
that
this
court
has
given
it
your
honor
because
the
state
has
argued
in
its
brief
that
the
reason
for
the
alibi
rule
is
to
combat
perjury.
the
reason
for
the
alibi
ruling
your
honors
is
in
a
quest
for
the
search
for
truth.
in
arguendo
your
honors,
i
concede
all
of
this
absolutely
for
the
sake
of
this
argument.
i
would
also
concede
your
honors
if
they
would
ask
and
without
being
utterly
facetious
about
it
that
the
alibi
rule
would
stop
pollution
and
stop
the
war
and
anything
else
because
your
honors,
i
think
not
subject
to
reasonable
question
that
whatever
comes
within
the
scope
of
the
fifth
amendment
it
is
not
subject
to
competing
state
interest.
the
state
has
not
been
able
to
show
a
solitary
case
which
came
within
the
fifth
amendment
that
this
court
or
any
other
court
has
said
or
at
least
that
this
court
has
said,
well
even
though
this
comes
within
the
fifth
amendment,
the
rights
of
the
state
in
this
context
are
so
great
that
we
are
not
going
to
bring
it
out
of
the
fifth
amendment.
your
honors,
i
suggested
in
my
brief
or
at
least
cited
in
my
brief
an
early
case
boyd
versus
united
states
which
had
to
do
with
the
forfeiture
of
goods
but
in
the
--
and
boyd,
this
court
quoted
from
an
english
trespass
case
and
there
the
english
justice
noted
that
trespass
in
a
single
nature
is
just
absolute.
and
i
suggest
that
at
least
whatever
the
fifth
amendment
says
it's
true
here,
that
as
the
english
case
said.
if
you're
going
to
have
an
invasion
of
this
privilege,
you
have
got
to
go
back
to
the
common
law
principles
and
find
some
justification
for
it
and
that
the
silence
of
the
books
according
to
the
english
justice
is
authority
against
the
invasion.
the
state
is
not
been
able
to
cite
a
solitary
case
of
this
court
or
any
case
in
principle
in
history
which
would
sanction
the
use
of
an
alibi
witness.
the
fact
i
note
parenthetically
that
the
alibi
witness
rule
has
been
proposed
twice
in
the
federal
rules
and
rejected
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is
determinative
of
all.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
your
honor
i'm
going
to
discuss
--
mr.
richard
kanner
i
agree,
i
believe
i've
cited
them
in
my
brief
but
i'm
going
to
discuss
now
the
interpretation
of
these
words
in
the
fifth
amendment
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
yourself
and
let's
see
what
these
words
mean.
let's
take
the
first
one
which
i
think
is
easiest
and
that
is
witness.
i
believe
your
honor
is
that
the
state
concedes
that
this
alibi
and
notice
rules
falls
within
the
term
'witness'
and
i
think
they
correctly
concede
that.
while
they
cite
in
their
brief
some
of
the
physical
test
cases
schmerber
versus
california
the
blood
alcohol
test,
i
believe
there
they
might
not
cite
the
finger
print
test
cases.
all
going
outside
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
properly
so,
is
i
understand
the
rationale
of
those
cases.
the
court
said
the
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
related
solely
to
communications
and
that
the
physical
test
not
being
communications
or
not
being
documents
or
not
within
fifth
amendment
and
i
only
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
rationale
should
not
be
expanded
today
because
since
the
state
apparently
concedes
that
the
notice
of
alibi
rule
is
within
the
purview
or
the
category
of
witness,
let's
leave
it
at
that.
i
know
that
one
case
that
i
cited
in
my
brief
albertson
versus
subversive
activities
control
board
which
was
the
case
which
this
court
said
the
communist
need
not
register.
now,
this
is
the
same
thing,
the
mere
fact
that
it's
a
document,
a
pleading
prior
to
trial
by
counsel
should
not
take
this
court
out
of
the
term
or
this
case
rather
out
of
the
term
of
witness.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
that's
--
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor,
the
fifth
amendment
doesn't
say
incriminatory
your
honor.
the
fifth
amendment
says
no
person
shall
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
this
is
position
that
the
state
takes.
the
state
says
this,
that
the
alibi
notice
rule
is
not
incriminating
but
its
exonerating.
mr.
richard
kanner
you're
going
to
bring
this
witness
into
trial
to
help
you
anyway
and
the
mere
acceleration
of
the
disclosure
of
notifying
the
state
attorney
is
to
when
this
witness
is
going
to
come
in
can
only
exonerate
you.
well
your
honors
as
i
reach
the
case
--
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
kanner
the
state
says
this
--
mr.
richard
kanner
the
defendant
is
never
going
to
witness,
the
state
--
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor,
the
state
says
this
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
marshall.
they
say
that
should
defendant
give
the
name
of
my
witnesses
prior
to
trial
to
the
prosecuting
attorney
is
according
to
the
procedural
rule
that
no
notice
can
be
ever
be
given
to
the
jury
by
way
of
opening
or
closing
argument
that
here,
the
defendant
supplied
the
state
with
the
names
of
the
alibi
witnesses,
where
are
those
alibi
witnesses?
your
honor,
the
defendant
says
or
rather
the
state
says
that
there
can
be
no
argument
like
that
to
the
jury.
they
have
not
cited
any
cases
and
i
have
not
found
the
first
case
your
honor
which
would
support
their
contention
that
should
i
comply
with
the
statute
that
this
alibi
witness
will
not
become
known
to
the
jury.
and
i
believe
your
honor
that
that
is
a
context.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
no
your
honor,
it
was
not
done
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
kanner
we
only
suggest
this
is
what
the
--
mr.
richard
kanner
no
your
honor,
i'm
suggesting
mr.
justice
marshall
that
in
answer
to
your
question,
if
the
defendant
would
not
testify,
how
the
alibi
notice
rule
would
be
a
witness.
i'm
only
trying
to
suggest
a
possibility
that
the
state
in
arguing
opening
and
closing
argument
to
the
jury
will
announce
to
the
jury
that
the
defendant
has
an
alibi.
we
do
not
believe
that
this
alibi
is
proper.
this
the
only
--
mr.
richard
kanner
these
assumptions
made
by
the
state
in
its
brief
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
i'm
arguing
my
side
your
honor
that
the
only
possible
way
that
the
witness
rule
can
apply
is
if
the
defendant
does
not
testify
as
in
the
context
that
i
have
suggested.
that
is
the
state
apparently
it
concedes
in
its
brief
that
the
alibi
notice
rule
comes
within
the
purview
of
witness
at
least
as
i
understand
their
brief.
mr.
richard
kanner
no
your
honor
but
i
only
suggest
the
--
regardless
of
whether
their
brief
buying
support,
i
only
suggest
that
in
the
communist
case
and
then
schmerber
versus
california,
this
court
held
that
witnesses
mean
anything
communication
and
i
feel
that
the
alibi
notice
rule
is
a
communication
within
the
fifth
amendment
scope
of
a
witness.
mr.
richard
kanner
our
only
alibi.
mr.
richard
kanner
no
--
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
as
i
read
the
cases.
i
--
or
at
least
i
as
counsel
have
the
sole
right
of
the
determining
when
i
am
going
to
make
this
judgment
as
to
what
to
put
forth
by
alibi
witness.
mr.
richard
kanner
as
i
read
the
cases
that
i've
cited
in
my
brief
--
mr.
richard
kanner
no!
schmerber
only
says
that,
what
is
a
witness,
i
didn't
cite
schmerber,
as
i
read
the
case
--
mr.
richard
kanner
those
words
may
have
been
used
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor,
i
have
possibly
used
the
term
testimonial
and
communicative
synonymously.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
it's
--
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor,
the
test
as
i
read
the
cases
your
honors
is
not
whether
the
disclosure
is
incriminating.
as
i
read
the
cases
your
honor,
the
test
is
whether
this
evidence
is
going
to
be
used
or
whether
this
information
can
be
used
by
the
state
at
trial.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
i
feel
that
cases
here
bring
the
notice
of
alibi
statute
within
the
term
witness.
i
feel
that
it
brings
the
language
--
the
cases
that
i
cited
brings
the
notice
of
alibi
rule
within
the
language
witness
against
himself
because
as
i
read
particularly
like
garrity
versus
new
jersey,
brown
versus
walker
that
the
defendant's
absolute
right
to
remain
silent
and
the
test
of
against
himself
at
least
as
i
read
the
cases
is
not
whether
it
is
incriminating.
true
that
in
most
all
instances
or
every
instance
that
i'm
aware
of,
the
rational
has
been
that
the
testimony
of
the
communication
was
incriminating
but
i
don't
read
the
fifth
amendment
like
that
as
you
--
as
i
read
the
fifth
amendment
and
as
i
read
the
cases
without
taking
things
out
of
context,
the
test
of
against
himself
is
whether
evidence
from
the
defendant's
own
lips
is
to
be
used
against
him
at
his
trial.
garrity
versus
new
jersey
as
i
recollect
was
a
case
where
some
policeman
testified
at
the
civil
service
area
and
then
this
evidence
was
used
in
their
trial.
well
the
record
doesn't
disclose
your
honor
but
theoretically
these
policeman
would
not
have
testified
at
the
civil
service
hearing
anything
but
what
they
thought
would
have
exonerated.
so
i
don't
feel
your
honors
that
the
test
of
against
himself
is
necessarily
incriminating
and
it
maybe
--
mr.
richard
kanner
not
in
the
list
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
kanner
not
in
the
list
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
kanner
well,
i
believe
that
the
state
is
conceded
that
it's
testimonial.
i
think
the
state
says
though
that
is
not
compulsion
and
the
reason
that
they
say
that
it's
not
compulsion,
i
believe
it
was
even
the
chief
justice
raised
or
maybe
justice
marshall
raised
the
question
that
since
this
alibi
witness
is
going
to
be
used
to
trial
anyway,
there's
no
compulsion
about
it
and
my
answer
to
this
your
honor
is
quite
simply
that
i
believe
that
i
as
counsel
have
got
the
absolute
positive
right
to
wait
until
the
conclusion
of
the
state's
case
before
i
want
to
make
a
decision
is
to
whether
i
wish
to
put
an
alibi
witness
on.
we
have
without
a
doubt.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
believe
that
the
fifth
amendment
requires
that
i
be
injured.
i
don't
believe
that
the
fifth
amendment
requires
that
i
incriminate
myself.
i
believe
that
the
fifth
amendment
says
that
i
cannot
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
myself
and
i
believe
that
your
point
is
certainly
the
most
difficult
that
i
have
to
overcome
that
is
what
is
the
test
of
“against
himself.”
i
believe
that
that
is
the
strongest
argument
that
the
state
has,
that
this
is
really
not
against
himself.
and
the
only
answer
that
i
have
to
this
your
honor
is
i
feel
that
i
have
an
absolute
right
to
remain
silent
up
until
the
very
close
of
the
state's
case
that
there
are
factors
that
are
going
to
be
apparent
only
at
trial
even
the
composition
of
the
jury
that
i'm
going
to
base
my
decision
on.
there
may
not
be
anything
incriminating
and
i
believe
the
analogy
is
reasonable
if
we
uphold
the
alibi-notice-rule,
the
state
can
come
back
and
say
ask
that
question
of
the
defendant
by
a
procedural
rule,
are
you
going
to
testify?
well,
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
any
question
about
that
as
being
invalid.
i
believe
that
we
uphold
the
alibi
notice
rule.
the
state
can
come
back
with
a
procedural
rule,
give
me
the
names
of
your
character
witnesses
if
you're
going
to
use
them.
mr.
richard
kanner
not
quite
mr.
justice
but
almost.
the
only
criminal
discovery
that
i
would
sanction
and
against
the
defendant
is
the
notice
of
insanity
and
the
reason
that
i
would
--
i
believe
that
the
notice
of
insanity
rule
is
good.
notice
of
insanity
is
very
similar
to
the
alibi
in
florida
and
i
believe
it's
predominant
through
out
the
state.
if
the
defendant
is
going
to
rely
on
insanity,
he
advices
the
state
a
certain
amount
of
days
before
trial
with
the
names
of
his
witnesses.
but
there
your
honors,
there
is
always
a
presumption
of
sanity
and
once
you
file
a
show
that
you
are
insane,
this
gives
the
state
an
additional
burden
of
proof
other
than
the
facts
that
are
in
the
information.
well
of
course
the
alibi-notice-rule
does
not.
so
mr.
justice,
in
answer
to
your
question,
the
notice
of
insanity
rule
is
the
only
criminal
discovery
that
i
as
a
trial
attorney
would
allow.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
black,
the
statute
provides
that
the
alibi
witness
cannot
testify,
the
defendant
himself
in
florida
can
testify
at
all
times
as
also
provision
in
the
rule
that
the
judge
if
the
circumstance
is
warranted
can
excuse
the
defendant
from
the
provisions
of
the
alibi
notice.
mr.
richard
kanner
well,
your
honor
we
are
getting
into
the
sixth
amendment
right
here
which
i
noticed
in
my
brief
of
washington
versus
texas
and
i'd
like
to
only
make
this
comment
that
i
raised
the
point
and
i
suggested
in
my
brief
washington
versus
texas
which
was
a
case
which
a
defendant
try
to
subpoena
a
co-defendant
who
was
not
on
trial
and
the
texas
procedure
apparently
was
that
the
co-defendant
could
not
testify.
i
am
going
to
answer
your
question
your
honor.
this
court
held
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
of
compulsory
attendance
of
witnesses
was
inapplicable
to
the
states.
your
honor,
i
did
not
specifically
raise
the
sixth
amendment
during
trial
but
i
have
always
relied
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
i
suggest
only
that
this
sixth
amendment
right
in
the
context
your
honors
that
i
presented
it
here
today
is
similar
to
our
fifth
amendment
right
against
self
incrimination.
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice,
the
law
of
the
procedural
rule
in
florida
is
clear
that
should
there
not
be
notice
given,
the
defendant
or
the
witness
rather
is
not
a
confident
witness
at
trial
unless
the
judge
within
the
exercise
of
his
own
discretion
--
mr.
richard
kanner
no
your
honor
because
i
complied
--
i
received
the
notice
of
alibi
form,
i
move
for
a
protected
order
on
the
fifth
amendment
on
grounds
and
also
the
florida
declaration
rights
ground
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
my
motion
for
protective
order
was
denied
which
is
how
this
case
got
here.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor,
we
get
down
here
to
the
--
i
see
here
that
my
time
is
about
running
out,
i'm
going
to
answer
your
question
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
your
honor
and
i
want
to
take
five
to
argue
the
jury
point.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honors
my
initial
reaction
on
the
jury
point
was
that
florida
being
spanish
domain,
our
six-man
jury
came
from
that.
in
the
words
of
the
vernacular
your
honor
suggests
isn't
so.
my
research
that
there
are
four
states
with
less
than
12
man
juries,
of
the
four
your
honor,
only
utah
has
had
a
six-man
jury
from
the
inception.
south
carolina
in
its
1776
constitutional
and
up
to
1865
had
12
man
juries.
florida
had
--
andrew
jackson's
first
order
when
he
was
territorial
government
said
that
all
criminal
cases
shall
be
tried
in
accordance
to
the
principles
of
the
common
law.
louisiana
your
honor,
there's
a
specific
federal
statute
when
louisiana
was
admitted
to
a
territory
that
said
all
criminal
cases
there
shall
be
a
jury
of
12.
so
your
honors,
i
feel
that
the
number
12
whether
it's
good
or
bad
regardless
the
number
12
your
honors
is
sufficient
and
rather
as
fundamental
to
our
jury
system.
your
honors
i
only
suggest
--
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
richard
kanner
i
did
in
--
during
this
period
of
time
while
this
case
was
pending.
i
did
a
great
deal
of
reading
to
try
and
answer
your
question
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
anywhere
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honors
as
i
read
it,
the
jury
was
always
12
or
more
and
that
the
reason,
the
12
came
out
--
mr.
richard
kanner
that
at
least
to
the
common
law
mr.
justice
that
at
least
12
persons
had
to
agree
and
if
they
couldn't
get
12
persons
to
agree
they
--
throughout
some
of
the
juries
and
they
brought
in
some
more
juries
and
held
12
could
agree.
i
believe
that
at
least
historically
is
how
i
read
it
but
i
don't
know
the
number
of
12.
your
honor
i
only
suggest
here
that
the
bill
of
rights
were
enacted
not
to
protect
the
guilty
or
rather
to
protect
the
innocent
but
rather
they
were
made
by
our
founders
to
protect
the
innocent
and
that
the
reasons
which
dictated
the
bill
of
rights
200
years
ago,
that
is
that
all
governments
want
to
get
rid
of
all
trouble
makers
as
quickly
as
possible
is
certainly
is
true
today
as
it
was
way
back
then.
and
your
honors
the
bill
or
rights
being
to
protect
the
guilty
and
to
shield
the
guilty
from
the
powers
of
the
state,
i
feel
that
it's
incumbent
on
this
court
to
read
them
in
the
manner
in
which
they
were
written.
and
then
answer
to
one
of
the
--
i
guess
--
one
of
the
justices,
there
is
no
criminal
discovery
in
a
--
against
to
the
defendant
unless
we're
going
to
change
the
literal
terms
of
the
fifth
amendment
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
mr.
richard
kanner
sir,
it
first
appears
under
constitution
of
1875
by
constitutional
amendment.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir.
we
suggest
that
in
our
brief
we
put
in
our
brief
joined
mr.
justice
harlan's
words
that
there's
nothing
significant
about
the
number
12
that
we've
come
to
get
this
number
based
on
the
anti-establishment
clause
that
its
basic
reference
comes
from
the
bible,
12
disciples
to
12
stones
to
12
tribes
of
israel
to
12
gates
to
jerusalem,
all
and
there's
nothing
significant
about
it.
and
that
six
people
can
provide
what
mr.
justice
white
did
say
that
we
put
to
provide
a
buffer
between
government
and
the
people
so
that
this
kind
of
a
pressure
is
not
put
on
people
by
overzealous
prosecutors
or
overzealous
government.
there
have
been
some
statistical
study
shown
in
winchester
massachusetts
district
court,
the
legislature
authorized
there
six-men
jury
and
the
report
said
that
it's
been
found
the
six
member
juries
render
the
same
kinds
of
verdicts
that
12
member
juries
render
or
their
render
the
same
kind
of
lawyers
would
expect
from
12-men
juries.
it
was
also
found
true
to
be
--
this
to
be
true
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
to
quote
mr.
justice
holmes
in
our
position,
he
says
that
it
is
revolting
that
we
have
no
better
reason
for
keeping
a
rule
than
that
rule
was
laid
down
in
the
time
of
henry
iv.
he
says
that
it's
more
revolting
as
the
grounds
upon
which
it
was
laid
down
long
vanished
and
the
rule
persist
from
the
blind
imitation
of
the
past.
we
think
that
the
12
men
jury
should
not
be
required
on
the
states,
additionally
we
think
that
the
numbers
game
is
not
essential
to
fulfilling
the
purpose
that
this
court
pronounced
in
duncan
versus
the
united
--
versus
louisiana
and
that
the
sole
purpose
of
the
jury
is
to
protect
the
public
and
whether
that
number
is
six
or
12,
it
is
fulfilled
and
that
there
is
nothing
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
the
sixth
amendment
when
you
use
six
men
on
a
jury
trial.
we
respectfully
urge
this
court
on
both
issues
to
affirm
the
district
court
of
appeal
and
to
hold
particularly
that
a
six
men
jury
does
not
violate
the
constitution
and
the
notice
of
alibi
does
not
violate
the
fifth
amendment
nor
the
due
process
clause
of
the
united
state
constitution.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
unless
the
court
has
any
question,
i
have
no
further
argument.
