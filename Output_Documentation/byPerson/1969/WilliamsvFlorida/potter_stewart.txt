justice
potter
stewart
it's
conditional?
justice
potter
stewart
on
defense
counsel
has
been
making
that
offer?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
the
chief
prosecuting
witness,
if
he
were
the
victim
of
the
offense
presumably?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
it
rather
incumbent
upon
you
to
show
us
why
this
is
constitutionally
invalid,
here
is
a
statute
or
rule
of
law
that
state
of
florida
would
use
it
quite
rightly
if
it
does
violate
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
constitution,
even
if
we
might
think
it
does
a
good
or
wise
rule
if
it
violates
the
constitution
that
violates
the
constitution,
but
that
as
i
understand
your
argument
is
what
you
told
us
so
far
now
isn't
it
incumbent
upon
you
to
tell
us
why
it
violates
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
not
up
to
florida
to
find
cases,
it's
rather
up
to
you
to
find
the
precedence.
justice
potter
stewart
well
this
is
what
is
requires
the
defendant
to
do
as
i
understand
it
specify
number
of
days
before
on
trial
to
ten
days
is
to
give
the
prosecution,
a
list
of
people
who
are
going
to
testify
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
and
his
behalf
and
then
his
favor.
justice
potter
stewart
in
support
of
his
alibi
defense
that's
what
i
mean.
how
does
this
--
i
don't
really
--
certainly
these
people
are
going
to
be
witnesses,
the
defendant
says
they're
going
to
be
witnesses,
there's
no
question
about,
no
problem
about
that
but
how
does
this
requirement
violate
the
defendant's
right
against
or
anybody
else's
right
against
self
incrimination?
justice
potter
stewart
or
constitutional
right
not
to
be
a
witness
against
him?
it's
all
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
that,
perhaps
that's
true
and
that
is
true
in
many
jurisdictions
but
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
the
self
incrimination
clause
of
the
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
schmerber
doesn't
decide
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
suppose
you
would.
you
make
the
suggestion
earlier
that
schmerber
made
the
dichotomy
between
communicative
and
non
communicative?
i
thought
the
dichotomy
in
schmerber
was
testimonial
and
non
testimonial?
justice
potter
stewart
they
were,
aren't
they?
that's
rather
different
isn't
it?
the
test
is
not
whether
the
violation
of
the
memo
to
communicate
something
in
advance,
whether
it's
testimonial
or
non-testimonial,
isn't
it,
as
far
as
the
privilege
is
concerned?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
not
what
you
might
allow,
it's
which
in
your
opinion
the
fifth
amendment
allows?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
size
the
jury
in
the
original
hundreds
when
the
jury
system
got
started?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
your
position
would
be
then
that
the
florida
constitutionally
could
have
a
statute
which
simply
says
that
the
accused
shall
ten
days
before
the
trial
provide
the
prosecutor
with
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
the
witnesses
he
expects
to
call
in
his
defense,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
why
not,
what's
your
theory
that
why
can't
you
do
it
here?
justice
potter
stewart
then
your
answer
is
that
constitutionally
the
state
could
go
that
far?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
mccrary,
mr.
kanner
suggested
that
you
concede
on
that
--
this
information
though
this
and
remain
the
witnesses
it's
testimonial.
justice
potter
stewart
i
should
think
in
your
argument
that
you
would
almost
have
to
assume
that
if
the
names
weren't,
given
the
defendant
couldn't
use
those
witnesses
on
his
behalf.
that's
what
the
statute
provides
can
happen
and
that's
what
the
constitutional
issue
really
is,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
here
the
names
were
given
and
the
witnesses
were
used.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
one
man,
excuse
me?
there
are
some
offenses
in
the
six
brothers
and
12
jurors
and
so.
justice
potter
stewart
why
the
distinction
or
other
offenses
of
six-man
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
this
petition,
they
got
a
life
imprisonment
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
get
up
the
life
before
a
six-man
jury
and
if
that's
involved,
it's
a
12
man?
justice
potter
stewart
really?
you
know
of
any
place
in
the
country
where
there
are
fewer
than
12
persons
on
the
jury
in
the
capital
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
suppose
if
your
position
is
sustained,
the
states
would
be
free
to
have
fewer
than
12
in
capital
cases
like
all
other
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
have
as
few
as
three?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
conditional?
justice
potter
stewart
on
defense
counsel
has
been
making
that

justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
the

how

there's
