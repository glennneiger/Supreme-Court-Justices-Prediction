e.

we'll
hear
arguments
in
number
927,
williams
against
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
kanner
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
state
of
florida,
does
the
statute
require
the
prosecution
to
furnish
this
to
its
witnesses?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
proceed
only
by
information
and
the
florida
not
by
indictment
at
all?m
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
talking
about
it
now
on
the
context
to
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
am
speaking
of
the
defendant
himself
when
you
say
it's
absolute
and
subject
to
no
qualifications,
do
you
mean
that
no
one
can
make
him
take
the
stand
under
oath
and
testify
or
not
under
oath
and
testify?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
wondering
what
scope
you
were
giving
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
communist
case
of
course
turned
to
a
large
extent
on
the
fact
that
there
was
incriminatory
aspect
to
the
registration,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
see
is
the
incriminatory
aspect
of
furnishing
the
names
of
witnesses?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
doesn't
against
himself
imply
the
same
thing
that
might
could
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
going
to
bring
the
witness
and
to
help
you,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
doesn't
bind
us
anyway.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
this
disclosure
become
testimony
in
any
term,
how
does
it
become
giving
evidence
or
becoming
a
witness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
what
you
left
me
in
the
dark
on
so
far.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
did
not
include
in
my
question
any
incriminatory
aspect.
i
just
said,
how
is
it
giving
evidence
becoming
a
witness,
how
is
it,
how
does
it
trespass
the
fifth
amendment
in
its
precise
language?
you
said
you
were
depending
on
the
precise
language.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
how
does
it
trespass
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
have
to
put
them
on
because
you
disclosed
his
name
though.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
position
is
not
impaired
except
on
this
hypothesis
that
you
went
around
with,
that
it
might
be
used
in
argument
by
the
prosecutor
but
if
justice
marshall
said
that
case
isn't
here
today,
how
are
you
injured
in
this
sense
by
disclosing
the
name
when
you
come
to
the
decision
of
whether
you
are
going
to
put
on
witnesses?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
mccrary.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
friend
seems
to
have
conceded
if
i
heard
him
correctly
that
it
does
not
violate
the
constitution
to
require
the
defendant
to
give
advance
notice
of
the
claim
of
insanity
by
way
of
defense.
i
take
it
defense
there,
insanity
is
an
affirmative
defense
in
florida.
now,
do
you
see
any
distinction
between
the
advance
notice
which
he
concedes
as
constitutional
and
the
advance
notice
on
alibis
which
he
argues
is
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
might
give
us
another
case
some
other
day.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
might
give
us
another
case
on
a
different
point
some
other
day.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
means
to
me
to
be
entirely
different
say
well
even
if
that
is
rule,
it
wasn't
broken
and
certainly
he
couldn't
have
been
harmed
by
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
it's
not
an
issue
in
this
case
at
all.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
only
have
about
three
minutes
left
and
we
haven't
got
to
the
six-man
jury
question,
so
after
lunch
we'll
hope
you
will
address
yourself
to
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
even
if
it
isn't
to
that
or
if
it's
that,
it
may
also
be
just
a
matter
of
line
drawing.
they
might
have
drawn
the
line,
the
defense
is
over
one
year
or
defense
is
over
two
years
or
as
some
other
states
have?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
use
six
now
don't
they
or
they
did
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
utah
it
historically
was
a
matter
of
the
lack
of
man
power.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
mccrary.

not.
