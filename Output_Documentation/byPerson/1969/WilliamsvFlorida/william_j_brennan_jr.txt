but
i
gather
for
example
finger
prints
that
are
taken
before
trial
are
used
by
the
prosecution
against
the
defendant
at
trial.
that's
information
they
obtain
for
the
purpose
of
using
it
against
the
defendant
in
that
trial.
you
would
not
claim
that
that
in
anyway
violated
privilege,
would
you?
justice
william
j.

blood
test?

so
you
really
have
to
hear
to
establish
that
in
giving
the
notice
on
the
name
of
the
witness,
this
is
testimonial
in
the
sense
that
we
do
a
distinction
between
testimonial
and
non-testimonial
schmerber
and
the
other
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
the
whole
thing
comes
down
to,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
argument
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
will
be
now
criminal
discovery
of
any
kind
against
himself?
