mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
all
respect,
the
positions
of
the
several
parties
in
this
case
are
something
like
ships
passing
in
the
night.
the
counsel
started
with
the
proposition
that
the
basic
question
here
is
the
constitutionality
of
section
9
(h)
of
the
taft-harley
act
repealed
some
ten
years
ago
and
then
proceeded
to
spend,
as
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
most
of
his
time
seeking
it
seemed
to
me
to
reopen
and
discuss
again
the
basic
underlying
facts
which
have
been
found
against
petitioner
at
his
jury
trial
some
15
years
ago.
now
we
look
at
the
case
somewhat
differently.
as
we
understand
it,
the
basic
question
here
the
basic
issue
that
the
court
repeals
started
was
faced
within
principle
on
which
we
decided
this
case
as
to
deal
with
the
question
of
whether
the
rational
of
this
court
in
dennis
versus
united
states
decided
several
terms
ago
applies
here.
in
short,
that
rational
is
simply
this.
that
one
who
fains
or
purports
to
comply
with
the
law
by
taking
some
sort
of
action
that
is
required
by
the
government
of
him
but
in
fact
is
proceeding
falsely
or
fraudulently
in
so
doing
lacks
standing
when
he’s
discovered
to
a
fact
that
fraudulently
to
challenge
the
law
that
he
purported
to
comply
with.
that
principle
was
not
established
in
dennis.
it
goes
back
to
earlier
cases
of
this
court
such
as
kay
and
kapp
that’s
been
accepted
by
every
circuit
to
my
knowledge
that
has
considered
it.
it
simply,
it
seems
to
me
basic
principle
of
judicial
administration.
any
other
rule
would
breed
i
would
suggest
disrespect
for
a
law.
it
would
invite
avoidance
or
attempted
avoidance
of
the
orderly
processes
of
law
when
one
took
it
up
himself
to
proceed
fraudulently
and
then
said
well,
yes
i
did
that
but
it’s
justifiable
because
the
statute
you
see
is
invalid.
now
as
we
understand
it,
principally
from
petitioner’s
brief,
he
suggests
that
there
are
several
respects
in
which
dennis
is
distinguishable.
he
says
first
that
dennis
involved
a
conspiracy
and
this
case
does
not.
what’s
true
as
the
court
ordered
or
noted
in
dennis.
some
of
the
petitioners
involved
in
conspiracy
they
are
charged
which
was
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
unites
states
by
doing
exactly
the
same
the
petitioner
did
filing
false
affidavits
under
section
9
(h)
of
taft-hartley.
the
court
noted
there
that
at
least
some
of
the
petitioners
could
have
been
charged
under
the
false
statement
act
that
petitioner
himself
was
charged
under
18
u.s.c.
1001.
i
take
it
the
reason
they
weren’t,
it
was
because
some
of
the
petitioners
who
allegedly
and
were
found
to
have
engaged
in
the
conspiracy
there
were
not
themselves
union
officers
required
to
file
this
affidavits,
but
instead
participated
with
union
officers
in
the
conspiracy
to
file.
we
cannot
really
see
that
the
fact
that
a
conspiracy
was
charged
and
was
involved
in
dennis
is
a
substantial
--
it
makes
that
case
of
substantial
difference.
there’s
some
language
in
the
court’s
opinion
in
dennis
that
refers
to
the
fact
of
conspiracy
but
as
we
understand
at
that
language
related
basically
to
a
threshold
issue
in
dennis
is
to
whether
the
indictment
was
appropriate
there.
and
the
court
concluded
that
it
was
appropriate
over
strenuous
arguments
made
in
the
contrary
and
in
the
course
of
that
noted
that
a
conspiracy
was
involved.
petitioner
also
notes
that
the
case
is
now
on
collateral
and
not
direct
review
and
in
that
respect
differs
from
dennis
and
for
some
reason
that
these
presents
a
different
situation.
now,
we’re
quite
aware
the
increasing
breath
of
the
scope
for
collateral
review
but
we
had
not
thought
that
we
have
reached
the
point
where
collateral
was
broader
than
direct.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
it’s
a
rather
difficult
notion
to
accept
that
petitioners
are
in
better
position
with
respect
to
the
basic
rational
on
which
the
court
relied
in
dennis.
individuals
involved
in
dennis
because
he
is
now
on
collateral
and
not
on
direct.
petitioner
also
suggests
and
has
argued
in
great
length
that
his
facts
are
different
than
the
facts
in
dennis.
well,
frankly
we
don’t
quite
understand
that
and
his
brief
he
relies
extensively
on
affidavit
that
he
filed
on
a
later
collateral
proceeding
and
here
he
is
noted
that
mr.
bryson
terminated
all
relationship
with
the
communist
party
in
1947,
at
least
in
his
view.
now
of
course
that
was
one
of
the
issues
that
jury
had
to
resolve
and
has
not
indicated
that
the
jury
resolve
that
against
him.
in
so
far
as
he
seeks
to
reopen
and
re-litigate
those
facts,
it
seems
to
us
that’s
not
an
appropriate
question
presented
in
this
court.
question
of
supposed
ambiguity
of
the
notion
of
affiliation
is
also
raised
by
petitioner.
there
may
well
be
contacts
in
which
the
notion
of
affiliation
with
the
communist
party
or
some
other
organizations
would
be
a
difficult
and
dubious
thing
to
present
to
a
jury.
but
as
mr.
justice
stewart
noted
in
the
context
here
under
a
very
narrow
and
limiting
instruction
which
is
set
out
in
the
government’s
brief
which
followed
and
was
confirmed
by
this
court’s
decision
in
killian
case
pages
6
and
7
of
the
government’s
brief
note
5
we
set
out
the
basic
construction.
the
jury
was
told
that
in
order
for
petitioner
to
have
been
affiliated
with
the
communist
party,
he
must
have
been
a
member
and
everything
but
name.
and
as
the
chief
justice
has
indicated,
the
facts
as
developed
for
the
jury
trial
indicated
that
various
incidence
from
the
evidence
are
related
which
indicated
that
petitioner
had
continued
to
maintain
at
least
some
connection
with
the
party,
connection
in
the
sense
that
a
jury
could
find
that
he
was
affiliated
with
the
party
when
he
filed
a
false
affidavit
in
1951.
i
think
that
any
analysis
of
the
dennis
opinion
makes
it
rather
clear
that
it’s
difficult
if
not
impossible
for
petitioner
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
concluding
the
dennis
was
controlling
here.
dennis
said
petitioners
are
in
no
position
to
attack
the
constitutionality
of
section
9
(h)
because
they
sought
to
circumvent
the
statute
not
to
challenge
it.
ways
are
open
to
challenge
the
validity
of
statutes
like
section
9
(h)
of
taft-hartley.
it
was
challenged
in
the
douds
case
but
it
was
upheld
as
we
indicate
and
as
the
facts
before
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
a
number
of
union
members
after
the
passage
of
union
officers
after
the
passage
of
section
9
(h)
who
were
members
of
the
communist
party
determined
that
the
best
course
of
action
was
for
them
to
formally
disassociate
themselves
with
the
party
and
then
file
when
and
if
necessary
those
affidavits
that
section
9
(h)
required.
as
the
facts
also
indicate
here
in
1958
jurisdictional
dispute
of
rules
in
the
union
that
petitioner
was
president
of
and
petitioner
then
took
it
upon
himself
to
file
this
affidavit
that
jury
found
to
be
false.
douds
was
decided
in
1950.
this
was
--
his
affidavit
was
filed
of
less
than
a
year
later.
i
think
that
the
situation
is
not
at
all
dissimilar
from
that
of
the
court
referred
to
in
dennis.
in
dennis,
the
court
said
that
in
view
of
these
circumstances
what
petitioners
there
did
was
to
flout,
not
simply
to
overlook
the
law.
the
court
in
dennis
further
noted
that
there
are
appropriated
and
inappropriate
ways
to
challenge
the
validity
of
a
statute.
and
that
even
though
in
some
circumstances
it
may
be
necessary
to
violate
a
statute
in
order
to
challenge
its
constitutionality
that
a
person
who
fains
to
comply
with
it,
who
purports
to
act
consistent
with
it
cannot
then
later
be
heard
to
challenge
it
when
he
has
discovered
have
acted
fraudulently.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
you
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
only
thing
that
i
would
say
yes
with
the
exception
of
your
use
of
the
term
“void”,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
he
is
seeking
to
challenge
section
9
(h)
that
has
not
been
held
unconstitutional
but
it
was
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
you
say
he
is
forced
to
take
some
action
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
with
all
respects
your
honor
i
don’t
think
the
statute
is
of
simply
no
effect.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
a
judgment
of
course
this
court
has
to
make.
the
court
has
already
passed.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
can’t
make
it
at
the
instance
of
this
particular
individual
because
what
he
has
sought
is
to
[voice
overlap]
support
the
legal
process.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
he
had
ways
available
to
him.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
just
as
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
and
there
were
ways
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
our
ways
are
open
to.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
court
has
held
this
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
in
the
kapp
case,
in
the
kay
case,
and
in
the
dennis
case.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
one
decided
three
terms
ago
in
384
u.s.
855,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
really
don’t
think
it
makes
any
difference.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
in
one
of
the
cases
that
we
refer
to,
i
believe
it’s
the
kapp
case.
agricultural
adjustment
act
had
already
been
held
unconstitutional.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
court
still
applied
this
principle.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
but
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
right.
right
but
i’m
suggesting
that
in
the
circumstances
here,
we
don’t
have
even
that
extreme
situation
because
as
the
situation
exists
right
now
that
statute
was
upheld
in
douds.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
that’s
one
way
of
looking
at
it.
that
it’s
not
even
reaching
the
problem
presented
if
you
assume
the
unconstitutionality.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
didn’t
think
i
was
suggesting
that
it’s
because
he
was
a
bad
fellow.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
simply
that
he
violated
the
false
statement
act
and
that’s
what
he
was
charged
of
violating
and
that’s
what
he
was
convicted,
having
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
because
he
purported
to
comply
with
the
statute.
now
he
is
seeking
to
turn
around
what
he
is
caught
in
complying
with
it
in
a
fraudulent
manner.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i’m
not
sure
that
i
understand.
i
agree
with
you
that
it
doesn’t
matter
whether
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
or
not.
so
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
but
i
think
that’s
an
entirely
different
situation.
and
that’s
the
situation
that
we
had
in
dennis
and
the
situation
here
don’t
involve
it.
dennis
stated
in
conclusion,
the
governing
principle
is
that
a
claim
of
unconstitutionality
will
not
be
heard
to
excuse
a
voluntary
deliberate
and
calculated
course
of
fraud
and
deceit.
one
who
elects
such
a
course
as
a
means
of
self-help
may
not
escape
the
consequences
by
urging
the
misconduct,
the
excuse
because
the
statute
which
he
sought
to
obeyed
is
unconstitutional.
as
i’ve
indicated,
the
government
feels
that
there
are
policy
considerations
that
support
the
rational
of
denis
as
well.
if
the
law
were
otherwise,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
but
an
open
invitation
to
individuals
to
seek
to
circumvent
a
law
but
according
to
comply
with
it,
in
the
course
of
which
they
would
commit
a
violation
of
the
statute
such
as
the
false
statement
act.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
that
the
charge
here
was
not
that
the
petitioner
had
violated
the
very
statute
he
seeks
to
challenge
is
unconstitutional
but
in
the
course
of
purporting
to
comply
with
statute
which
he
now
says
is
unconstitutional.
he
violated
a
general
statute
applicable
to
a
variety
of
circumstances
by
falling
--
filing
a
false
affidavit.
our
analogy
is
that
exists
in
the
law
apart
from
dennis
and
kay
and
kapp.
it’s
long
been
established,
this
court
held
in
the
williams
case
the
one
who
takes
the
stand
and
commits
perjury
in
the
course
of
a
prosecution
later
held
invalid
can
be
tried
for
that
perjury.
moreover,
the
government
needs
statutes
like
section
1001
in
order
to
fulfill
its
varied
obligations
of
obtaining
information
in
order
to
carryout
a
variety
of
programs.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
of
course,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
this
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
what
we
are
maintaining
your
honor
is
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
in
order
to
be
a
member.
in
order
to
hold
office
in
the
union
under
the
statute
that’s
been
repealed
some
10
years
ago.
an
officer
had
to
file
an
affidavit
to
the
effect
that
he
did
not
support
the
communist
party.
he
was
neither
a
member
nor
affiliated
with
the
communist
party.
the
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting
that
provision
is
what
counsel
has
indicated
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
want
to
be
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
would
have
more
difficulty
with
that
your
honor
in
light
of
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
because
the
congress
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
because
the
congress
made
a
number
of
findings
on
which
it
premised
its
legislative
judgment
here
regarding
the
nature
of
the
communist
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
am
i
suggesting
that
there
were
ways
that
he
could
have
properly
proceeded
to
challenge
its
law
but
he
didn’t
do
that.
instead
he
filed
his
affidavit
which
purported
to
comply
with,
which
the
jury
found
was
false.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
again
your
honor
in
the
douds
case,
the
court
held
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
american
communications
association
versus
douds
decided
in
1950
just
prior
to
the
filing
of
this
false
affidavit
held
that
the
statue
section
9
(h)
was
valid
and
was
constitutional.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
we
don’t
have
to
stand
on
douds
your
honor.
we
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
we
suggest
in
our
brief
that
there
are
ways
of
distinguishing
the
court’s
holding
in
brown
which
held
the
successor
statute
section
504
bland
and
griffin
invalid.
whereas
of
distinguishing
brown
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i’m
seeking
to
respond
to
mr.
justice
black’s
inquiry.
we’re
not
willing
to
concede
that
douds
has
been
overruled.
[voice
overlap]
i
would
try
to
rely
on
the
elaboration
in
our
brief
far
over
than
anymore
at
all
argument?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
you’re
the
one
who
mentioned
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
and
i
suggested
that
the
court
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
douds
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
douds
was
the
case
that
held
to
the
contrary
of
your
sub-position
your
honor.
as
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
brennan
have
suggested,
we
feel
that
petitioner’s
convictions
should
be
upheld
regardless
of
whether
the
court
feels
that
douds
should
be
reach
de
novo
rule
here
or
not.
section
9
(h)
is
no
longer
on
the
books.
it
hasn’t
been
for
10
years.
petitioner
is
asking
this
court
to
reach
back
and
hold
unconstitutional
statute
that
congress
itself
has
repealed
some
10
years
ago.
petitioner
also
is
asking
the
court
as
we
understand
it
to
apply
the
decision
in
united
states
versus
brown
retroactively.
he
is
not
suggesting
any
compelling
reasons
for
doing
so
but
it
seems
too
soon
that
that’s
been
done.
moreover,
statutes
that
are
enacted
and
later
held
invalid
or
repeal,
do
have
as
the
court
held
in
the
chicot
county
drainage
district
case
and
has
held
over
and
over
again.
they
do
have
an
operative
effect
and
they
are
of
some
significance
for
the
time
that
there
are
in
existence?
it
seems
to
us
that
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
since
there
simply
is
no
element
of
the
separate
crime
of
violating
18
u.s.c.
1001,
the
false
statement
act
involved
in
the
matter
relating
to
the
validity
of
section
9
(h)
that
petitioner
is
conviction
is
a
valid
one
and
should
be
upheld
basically
has
been
indicated.
we
stand
on
the
dennis
rational
and
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
conclude
the
dennis
controlled
here
unless
this
court
is
willing
to
overrule
dennis.
we
think
that
petitioner’s
conviction
was
properly
upheld
below
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
of
course
not,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
suggested
your
honor
that
even
if
the
dennis
case
is
overruled
there
are
circumstances
in
this
particular
situation
here
which
it
seems
to
me
don’t
warrant
the
court’s
exercise
of
its
power
to
reach
these
questions
that
is
raised
here.
thank
you.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
all
respect,
the
positions
of
the
several
parties
in
this
case
are
something
like
ships
passing
in
the
night.
the
counsel
started
with
the
proposition
that
the
basic
question
here
is
the
constitutionality
of
section
9
(h)
of
the
taft-harley
act
repealed
some
ten
years
ago
and
then
proceeded
to
spend,
as
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
most
of
his
time
seeking
it
seemed
to
me
to
reopen
and
discuss
again
the
basic
underlying
facts
which
have
been
found
against
petitioner
at
his
jury
trial
some
15
years
ago.
now
we
look
at
the
case
somewhat
differently.
as
we
understand
it,
the
basic
question
here
the
basic
issue
that
the
court
repeals
started
was
faced
within
principle
on
which
we
decided
this
case
as
to
deal
with
the
question
of
whether
the
rational
of
this
court
in
dennis
versus
united
states
decided
several
terms
ago
applies
here.
in
short,
that
rational
is
simply
this.
that
one
who
fains
or
purports
to
comply
with
the
law
by
taking
some
sort
of
action
that
is
required
by
the
government
of
him
but
in
fact
is
proceeding
falsely
or
fraudulently
in
so
doing
lacks
standing
when
he’s
discovered
to
a
fact
that
fraudulently
to
challenge
the
law
that
he
purported
to
comply
with.
that
principle
was
not
established
in
dennis.
it
goes
back
to
earlier
cases
of
this
court
such
as
kay
and
kapp
that’s
been
accepted
by
every
circuit
to
my
knowledge
that
has
considered
it.
it
simply,
it
seems
to
me
basic
principle
of
judicial
administration.
any
other
rule
would
breed
i
would
suggest
disrespect
for
a
law.
it
would
invite
avoidance
or
attempted
avoidance
of
the
orderly
processes
of
law
when
one
took
it
up
himself
to
proceed
fraudulently
and
then
said
well,
yes
i
did
that
but
it’s
justifiable
because
the
statute
you
see
is
invalid.
now
as
we
understand
it,
principally
from
petitioner’s
brief,
he
suggests
that
there
are
several
respects
in
which
dennis
is
distinguishable.
he
says
first
that
dennis
involved
a
conspiracy
and
this
case
does
not.
what’s
true
as
the
court
ordered
or
noted
in
dennis.
some
of
the
petitioners
involved
in
conspiracy
they
are
charged
which
was
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
unites
states
by
doing
exactly
the
same
the
petitioner
did
filing
false
affidavits
under
section
9
(h)
of
taft-hartley.
the
court
noted
there
that
at
least
some
of
the
petitioners
could
have
been
charged
under
the
false
statement
act
that
petitioner
himself
was
charged
under
18
u.s.c.
1001.
i
take
it
the
reason
they
weren’t,
it
was
because
some
of
the
petitioners
who
allegedly
and
were
found
to
have
engaged
in
the
conspiracy
there
were
not
themselves
union
officers
required
to
file
this
affidavits,
but
instead
participated
with
union
officers
in
the
conspiracy
to
file.
we
cannot
really
see
that
the
fact
that
a
conspiracy
was
charged
and
was
involved
in
dennis
is
a
substantial
--
it
makes
that
case
of
substantial
difference.
there’s
some
language
in
the
court’s
opinion
in
dennis
that
refers
to
the
fact
of
conspiracy
but
as
we
understand
at
that
language
related
basically
to
a
threshold
issue
in
dennis
is
to
whether
the
indictment
was
appropriate
there.
and
the
court
concluded
that
it
was
appropriate
over
strenuous
arguments
made
in
the
contrary
and
in
the
course
of
that
noted
that
a
conspiracy
was
involved.
petitioner
also
notes
that
the
case
is
now
on
collateral
and
not
direct
review
and
in
that
respect
differs
from
dennis
and
for
some
reason
that
these
presents
a
different
situation.
now,
we’re
quite
aware
the
increasing
breath
of
the
scope
for
collateral
review
but
we
had
not
thought
that
we
have
reached
the
point
where
collateral
was
broader
than
direct.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
it’s
a
rather
difficult
notion
to
accept
that
petitioners
are
in
better
position
with
respect
to
the
basic
rational
on
which
the
court
relied
in
dennis.
individuals
involved
in
dennis
because
he
is
now
on
collateral
and
not
on
direct.
petitioner
also
suggests
and
has
argued
in
great
length
that
his
facts
are
different
than
the
facts
in
dennis.
well,
frankly
we
don’t
quite
understand
that
and
his
brief
he
relies
extensively
on
affidavit
that
he
filed
on
a
later
collateral
proceeding
and
here
he
is
noted
that
mr.
bryson
terminated
all
relationship
with
the
communist
party
in
1947,
at
least
in
his
view.
now
of
course
that
was
one
of
the
issues
that
jury
had
to
resolve
and
has
not
indicated
that
the
jury
resolve
that
against
him.
in
so
far
as
he
seeks
to
reopen
and
re-litigate
those
facts,
it
seems
to
us
that’s
not
an
appropriate
question
presented
in
this
court.
question
of
supposed
ambiguity
of
the
notion
of
affiliation
is
also
raised
by
petitioner.
there
may
well
be
contacts
in
which
the
notion
of
affiliation
with
the
communist
party
or
some
other
organizations
would
be
a
difficult
and
dubious
thing
to
present
to
a
jury.
but
as
mr.
justice
stewart
noted
in
the
context
here
under
a
very
narrow
and
limiting
instruction
which
is
set
out
in
the
government’s
brief
which
followed
and
was
confirmed
by
this
court’s
decision
in
killian
case
pages
6
and
7
of
the
government’s
brief
note
5
we
set
out
the
basic
construction.
the
jury
was
told
that
in
order
for
petitioner
to
have
been
affiliated
with
the
communist
party,
he
must
have
been
a
member
and
everything
but
name.
and
as
the
chief
justice
has
indicated,
the
facts
as
developed
for
the
jury
trial
indicated
that
various
incidence
from
the
evidence
are
related
which
indicated
that
petitioner
had
continued
to
maintain
at
least
some
connection
with
the
party,
connection
in
the
sense
that
a
jury
could
find
that
he
was
affiliated
with
the
party
when
he
filed
a
false
affidavit
in
1951.
i
think
that
any
analysis
of
the
dennis
opinion
makes
it
rather
clear
that
it’s
difficult
if
not
impossible
for
petitioner
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
concluding
the
dennis
was
controlling
here.
dennis
said
petitioners
are
in
no
position
to
attack
the
constitutionality
of
section
9
(h)
because
they
sought
to
circumvent
the
statute
not
to
challenge
it.
ways
are
open
to
challenge
the
validity
of
statutes
like
section
9
(h)
of
taft-hartley.
it
was
challenged
in
the
douds
case
but
it
was
upheld
as
we
indicate
and
as
the
facts
before
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
a
number
of
union
members
after
the
passage
of
union
officers
after
the
passage
of
section
9
(h)
who
were
members
of
the
communist
party
determined
that
the
best
course
of
action
was
for
them
to
formally
disassociate
themselves
with
the
party
and
then
file
when
and
if
necessary
those
affidavits
that
section
9
(h)
required.
as
the
facts
also
indicate
here
in
1958
jurisdictional
dispute
of
rules
in
the
union
that
petitioner
was
president
of
and
petitioner
then
took
it
upon
himself
to
file
this
affidavit
that
jury
found
to
be
false.
douds
was
decided
in
1950.
this
was
--
his
affidavit
was
filed
of
less
than
a
year
later.
i
think
that
the
situation
is
not
at
all
dissimilar
from
that
of
the
court
referred
to
in
dennis.
in
dennis,
the
court
said
that
in
view
of
these
circumstances
what
petitioners
there
did
was
to
flout,
not
simply
to
overlook
the
law.
the
court
in
dennis
further
noted
that
there
are
appropriated
and
inappropriate
ways
to
challenge
the
validity
of
a
statute.
and
that
even
though
in
some
circumstances
it
may
be
necessary
to
violate
a
statute
in
order
to
challenge
its
constitutionality
that
a
person
who
fains
to
comply
with
it,
who
purports
to
act
consistent
with
it
cannot
then
later
be
heard
to
challenge
it
when
he
has
discovered
have
acted
fraudulently.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
you
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
only
thing
that
i
would
say
yes
with
the
exception
of
your
use
of
the
term
“void”,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
he
is
seeking
to
challenge
section
9
(h)
that
has
not
been
held
unconstitutional
but
it
was
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
you
say
he
is
forced
to
take
some
action
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
with
all
respects
your
honor
i
don’t
think
the
statute
is
of
simply
no
effect.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
a
judgment
of
course
this
court
has
to
make.
the
court
has
already
passed.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
can’t
make
it
at
the
instance
of
this
particular
individual
because
what
he
has
sought
is
to
[voice
overlap]
support
the
legal
process.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
he
had
ways
available
to
him.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
just
as
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
and
there
were
ways
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
our
ways
are
open
to.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
court
has
held
this
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
in
the
kapp
case,
in
the
kay
case,
and
in
the
dennis
case.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
one
decided
three
terms
ago
in
384
u.s.
855,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
really
don’t
think
it
makes
any
difference.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
in
one
of
the
cases
that
we
refer
to,
i
believe
it’s
the
kapp
case.
agricultural
adjustment
act
had
already
been
held
unconstitutional.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
court
still
applied
this
principle.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
but
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
right.
right
but
i’m
suggesting
that
in
the
circumstances
here,
we
don’t
have
even
that
extreme
situation
because
as
the
situation
exists
right
now
that
statute
was
upheld
in
douds.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
that’s
one
way
of
looking
at
it.
that
it’s
not
even
reaching
the
problem
presented
if
you
assume
the
unconstitutionality.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
didn’t
think
i
was
suggesting
that
it’s
because
he
was
a
bad
fellow.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
simply
that
he
violated
the
false
statement
act
and
that’s
what
he
was
charged
of
violating
and
that’s
what
he
was
convicted,
having
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
because
he
purported
to
comply
with
the
statute.
now
he
is
seeking
to
turn
around
what
he
is
caught
in
complying
with
it
in
a
fraudulent
manner.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i’m
not
sure
that
i
understand.
i
agree
with
you
that
it
doesn’t
matter
whether
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
or
not.
so
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
but
i
think
that’s
an
entirely
different
situation.
and
that’s
the
situation
that
we
had
in
dennis
and
the
situation
here
don’t
involve
it.
dennis
stated
in
conclusion,
the
governing
principle
is
that
a
claim
of
unconstitutionality
will
not
be
heard
to
excuse
a
voluntary
deliberate
and
calculated
course
of
fraud
and
deceit.
one
who
elects
such
a
course
as
a
means
of
self-help
may
not
escape
the
consequences
by
urging
the
misconduct,
the
excuse
because
the
statute
which
he
sought
to
obeyed
is
unconstitutional.
as
i’ve
indicated,
the
government
feels
that
there
are
policy
considerations
that
support
the
rational
of
denis
as
well.
if
the
law
were
otherwise,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
but
an
open
invitation
to
individuals
to
seek
to
circumvent
a
law
but
according
to
comply
with
it,
in
the
course
of
which
they
would
commit
a
violation
of
the
statute
such
as
the
false
statement
act.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
that
the
charge
here
was
not
that
the
petitioner
had
violated
the
very
statute
he
seeks
to
challenge
is
unconstitutional
but
in
the
course
of
purporting
to
comply
with
statute
which
he
now
says
is
unconstitutional.
he
violated
a
general
statute
applicable
to
a
variety
of
circumstances
by
falling
--
filing
a
false
affidavit.
our
analogy
is
that
exists
in
the
law
apart
from
dennis
and
kay
and
kapp.
it’s
long
been
established,
this
court
held
in
the
williams
case
the
one
who
takes
the
stand
and
commits
perjury
in
the
course
of
a
prosecution
later
held
invalid
can
be
tried
for
that
perjury.
moreover,
the
government
needs
statutes
like
section
1001
in
order
to
fulfill
its
varied
obligations
of
obtaining
information
in
order
to
carryout
a
variety
of
programs.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
of
course,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
this
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
what
we
are
maintaining
your
honor
is
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
in
order
to
be
a
member.
in
order
to
hold
office
in
the
union
under
the
statute
that’s
been
repealed
some
10
years
ago.
an
officer
had
to
file
an
affidavit
to
the
effect
that
he
did
not
support
the
communist
party.
he
was
neither
a
member
nor
affiliated
with
the
communist
party.
the
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting
that
provision
is
what
counsel
has
indicated
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
want
to
be
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
would
have
more
difficulty
with
that
your
honor
in
light
of
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
because
the
congress
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
because
the
congress
made
a
number
of
findings
on
which
it
premised
its
legislative
judgment
here
regarding
the
nature
of
the
communist
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
am
i
suggesting
that
there
were
ways
that
he
could
have
properly
proceeded
to
challenge
its
law
but
he
didn’t
do
that.
instead
he
filed
his
affidavit
which
purported
to
comply
with,
which
the
jury
found
was
false.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
again
your
honor
in
the
douds
case,
the
court
held
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
american
communications
association
versus
douds
decided
in
1950
just
prior
to
the
filing
of
this
false
affidavit
held
that
the
statue
section
9
(h)
was
valid
and
was
constitutional.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
we
don’t
have
to
stand
on
douds
your
honor.
we
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
we
suggest
in
our
brief
that
there
are
ways
of
distinguishing
the
court’s
holding
in
brown
which
held
the
successor
statute
section
504
bland
and
griffin
invalid.
whereas
of
distinguishing
brown
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i’m
seeking
to
respond
to
mr.
justice
black’s
inquiry.
we’re
not
willing
to
concede
that
douds
has
been
overruled.
[voice
overlap]
i
would
try
to
rely
on
the
elaboration
in
our
brief
far
over
than
anymore
at
all
argument?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
you’re
the
one
who
mentioned
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
and
i
suggested
that
the
court
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
douds
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
douds
was
the
case
that
held
to
the
contrary
of
your
sub-position
your
honor.
as
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
brennan
have
suggested,
we
feel
that
petitioner’s
convictions
should
be
upheld
regardless
of
whether
the
court
feels
that
douds
should
be
reach
de
novo
rule
here
or
not.
section
9
(h)
is
no
longer
on
the
books.
it
hasn’t
been
for
10
years.
petitioner
is
asking
this
court
to
reach
back
and
hold
unconstitutional
statute
that
congress
itself
has
repealed
some
10
years
ago.
petitioner
also
is
asking
the
court
as
we
understand
it
to
apply
the
decision
in
united
states
versus
brown
retroactively.
he
is
not
suggesting
any
compelling
reasons
for
doing
so
but
it
seems
too
soon
that
that’s
been
done.
moreover,
statutes
that
are
enacted
and
later
held
invalid
or
repeal,
do
have
as
the
court
held
in
the
chicot
county
drainage
district
case
and
has
held
over
and
over
again.
they
do
have
an
operative
effect
and
they
are
of
some
significance
for
the
time
that
there
are
in
existence?
it
seems
to
us
that
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
since
there
simply
is
no
element
of
the
separate
crime
of
violating
18
u.s.c.
1001,
the
false
statement
act
involved
in
the
matter
relating
to
the
validity
of
section
9
(h)
that
petitioner
is
conviction
is
a
valid
one
and
should
be
upheld
basically
has
been
indicated.
we
stand
on
the
dennis
rational
and
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
conclude
the
dennis
controlled
here
unless
this
court
is
willing
to
overrule
dennis.
we
think
that
petitioner’s
conviction
was
properly
upheld
below
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
of
course
not,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
suggested
your
honor
that
even
if
the
dennis
case
is
overruled
there
are
circumstances
in
this
particular
situation
here
which
it
seems
to
me
don’t
warrant
the
court’s
exercise
of
its
power
to
reach
these
questions
that
is
raised
here.
thank
you.
