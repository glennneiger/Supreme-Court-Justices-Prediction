mr.
richard
gladstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
brings
into
question,
the
constitutionality
of
section
9
(h)
of
the
taft-hartley
act
of
1947.
that
act
provided
in
substance
that
before
a
labor
union
could
resort
to
the
facilities
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
each
of
its
officers
most
annually
signed
in
filing
non-communist
affidavit.
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute
was
upheld
in
1950
in
the
case
of
american
communications
association
against
douds.
the
chief
opinion
was
written
by
chief
justice
vinson
in
which
two
other
members
of
the
court
concurred,
justices
frankfurter
and
jackson
wrote
separate
opinions,
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
mr.
justice
black
dissented
on
a
number
of
grounds
including
explicitly
an
expression
of
his
view
of
section
9
(h)
was
a
bill
of
attainder
and
therefore
violated
the
article
i
section
9
of
the
constitution.
congress,
it
appears
was
not
satisfied
with
its
experience
under
section
9
(h)
and
12
years
after
its
passage,
nine
years
after
this
court
was
persuaded
to
sustain
it.
the
congress
have
repealed
that
law
and
replaced
it
with
section
504
of
the
labor
management
relations
act.
that
section
provided
that
it
was
a
crime
for
a
man
simultaneously
to
hold
union
office
and
to
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
that
statute
was
held
unconstitutional
by
this
court
in
united
states
against
archie
brown,
1965
in
an
opinion
written
by
the
chief
justice,
four
other
members
of
the
court
concurring
in
the
opinion
on
the
expressed
ground
of
section
504
was
unconstitutional
bill
of
attainder.
one
of
the
questions
certified
in
this
case
is
whether
in
the
comparative
light
of
american
communications
association
versus
doubts
and
united
states
versus
brown,
section
9
(h)
is
constitutional.
let
me
say
a
few
words
about
the
background
of
this
case
in
order
to
put
the
other
two
certified
questions
in
perspective.
petitioner
here
was
one
time
the
president
of
a
small
maritime
labor
union
numbering
some
3,000
members
who
served
on
vessels
plying
in
and
out
of
pacific
coast
port
in
the
steward’s
department
of
those
ships.
in
1951,
he
signed
and
filed
the
affidavit
as
required
--
that
was
required
at
the
time
under
taft-hartley
law.
the
union
was
and
had
been
for
some
time
engaged
in
the
bitter
jurisdictional
dispute
which
ultimately
led
to
the
dissolution
of
the
organization
itself.
now,
the
affidavit
that
he
filed
was
a
printed
form.
but
the
labor
board
supplied
and
it
recited
three
basic
things.
it
recited
that
the
files
at
the
time
he
signed
did
not
then
support
any
organization
that
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force,
violation
or
other
unconstitutional
or
illegal
means.
it
provided
second
that
he
said
he
was
then
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party
specifically
naming
the
communist
party
in
the
second
portion.
it
provided
third,
that
he
was
not
then
affiliate
for
the
communist
party.
in
1954,
almost
three
yeas
after
the
filing
of
the
1951
affidavit
although
i
should
state
that
in
1952
bryson
filed
the
affidavit.
he
did
the
same
in
1953
and
again
in
1954
if
my
memory
served
me
correctly,
even
after
he
was
indicted
on
the
1951
affidavit.
he
was
charged
in
the
indictment
with
three
counts
of
violation,
all
three
of
the
portions
that
i
have
mentioned
.prior
to
the
trial,
the
government
dismissed
the
count
that
charged
him
of
supporting
an
organization
that
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government.
he
went
to
trial
on
the
counts
concerning
membership
and
concerning
affiliation.
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
holding
or
i
should
say
that
this
was
brought
under
the
false
statement
statute
which
it
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
in
the
petition.
jury
returned
the
verdict
holding
that
when
he
swore
that
he
was
not
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
he
was
not
falsely
swearing.
on
the
other
hand,
it
returned
the
verdict
holding
that
he
did
violate
the
law
when
he
swore
that
he
was
not
then
affiliated
for
the
communist
party.
bryson
was
sentence
to
five
years
in
prison
and
a
fine
of
$10,000
which
was
the
maximum.
and
in
addition,
the
trial
judge
provided
expressly
that
he
could
be
subject
to
further
imprisonment
in
the
event
that
he
failed
to
pay
the
fine.
he
served
nearly
two
years
of
his
term
and
then
was
paroled.
and
in
the
intervening
years
he
has
managed
to
pay
$2,000
of
the
$10,000
fine
but
the
there
is
a
balance
of
$8,000.
shortly
before
we
filed
a
petition
in
the
district
court
that
commenced
the
proceedings
that
are
now
here,
the
government
noticed
the
taking
of
bryson’s
deposition
of
the
original
criminal
proceeding
and
did
take
his
--
the
position
seeking
assets
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
the
collection
of
the
$8,000
balance.
and
thereafter,
the
government
filed
a
civil
action
in
the
federal
district
court
in
san
francisco
seeking
judgment
for
the
$8,000.
a
week
or
two
after
that,
bryson’s
petition
was
filed
with
the
district
court
seeking
a
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
or
relief
under
the
other
applicable
post-conviction
statutes.
one
of
the
basic
grounds
upon
which
that
relief
was
sought
was
the
allegation
that
under
united
states
versus
brown,
the
constitutional
basis
of
section
9
(h)
had
been
eroded
along
with
other
decisions
that
it
was
constitutionally
infirmed,
that
it
should
be
controlled
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
united
states
against
brown
and
therefore
that
petition
of
original
conviction
had
been
unconstitutionally
obtained.
the
district
judge
granted
petition
in
all
respects
except
not
granting
the
prayer
for
a
return
of
the
$2,000
that
bryson
has
paid
to
the
government
on
his
fine.
the
government
took
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
ninth
circuit
and
that
court
in
a
per
curiam
decision
reversed
holding
that
bryson
was
precluded
for
bringing
his
petition
by
reason
of
a
decision
of
this
court
in
dennis
versus
the
united
states.
that
case
was
a
case
in
which
this
court
declined
to
review
a
challenge
of
constitutionality
against
section
9
(h)
upon
the
ground
for
the
petitions
in
that
case
were
shown
to
have
been
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
to
deceive
and
to
the
defraud
the
government
and
therefore
that
they
had
lost
standing.
the
court
of
appeals
holding
that
dennis
presented
an
insuperable
obstacle
to
us
declined
the
test
on
the
other
questions
and
reversed.
the
other
two
questions
presented
and
certified
here
then
are:
one,
whether
the
petitioner
is
precluded
by
reason
of
this
court’s
decision
in
dennis
from
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
9
(h).
the
other
is
whether
the
petitioner
qualifies
regardless
of
dennis
upon
the
ground
that
it’s
inapplicable
in
as
much
as
this
is
a
post-conviction
proceeding
and
under
the
all
writs
section
or
under
the
other
section
providing
for
such
relief,
he
would
qualify
for
this
relief.
mr.
richard
gladstein
yes,
i
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
i
know.
i
can
see
that.
yes,
your
honor.
however,
the
vitality
of
it
still
affects
bryson
and
as
hope
to
argue
also
affects
to
its
detriment
to
the
bill
of
attainder
provision
in
our
constitution.
now,
let
me
say
something
about
the
petitioner
of
the
evidence
here.
because
i
suppose
in
the
last
analysis,
this
court
is
not
going
to
look
nearly
at
forms
as
the
government
invites
it
to
do
and
say
well,
in
dennis
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
defraud
and
bryson’s
case
the
jury
found
that
he
lied
about
whether
or
not
he
was
affiliated
with
the
communist
party
and
therefore
they
are
on
a
par,
this
is
the
government’s
argument.
i
would
suppose
that
if
dennis
lays
down
a
rule,
the
court
created
by
which
the
court
will
determine
in
its
own
discretion
whether
or
not
a
particular
person
is
entitled
to
be
heard
has
standing
to
be
heard.
one
must
look
at
the
character
of
the
particular
petitioner
in
so
far
at
least
as
the
record
and
the
evidence
would
seem
to
show.
now
in
petitioner’s
case,
the
facts
are
these.
there’s
no
question
that
for
a
period
of
ten
years
between
1937
and
1947,
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
he
was
an
officer
of
that
party.
he
was
an
officer
under
what
was
called
the
waterfront
section
level
in
san
francisco
and
he
was
an
officer
on
a
state
level,
state
committee.
there
was
no
suggestion
in
this
record
that
bryson
never
tried
to
concede
the
fact
that
his
membership
or
holding
office
in
the
communist
party
when
he
was
a
member
of
it.
now
in
1947,
he
terminated
his
associations
and
there
is
no
evidence.
there
was
no
evidence
of
the
trial
to
sustain
any
charge
that
there
was
an
active
relationship
between
him
and
the
party
thereafter.
the
evidence
upon
which
he
was
convicted
not
of
membership
but
of
association
of
affiliation
summarize
by
the
government
in
its
brief,
and
i
assume
that
they
have
called
from
it
as
much
as
there
is
and
this
is
one
of
the
matters
to
it
that
comes
on
pages
5
and
6
of
the
government’s
brief.
first,
he
said
that
in
1949,
at
an
open
union
convention,
he
--
i
quote
what
they
say,
“premised
--
he
refused
to
see
that
delegate
to
a
union
conversion
premised
on
the
delegate’s
failure
to
accept
an
opportunity
to
join
the
communist
party.”
so
not
only
was
that
two
years
before
he
filed
the
affidavit
in
this
case.
but
i
mentioned
that
this
is
the
type
of
evidence
on
which
the
affiliation
count
was
based.
mr.
richard
gladstein
there
was
no
announcement.
there
was
a
cessation
of
all
relationship,
all
active
relationship
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
in
1947,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
gladstein
this
and
two
or
three
other
statements
attributed
to
him.
yes,
one
in
1949
and
several
in
1951.
one
of
which
as
the
government
correctly
points
out
was
two
months
after
he
had
filed
his
affidavit
in
1951.
he
then
is
supposed
to
use
--
it
was
testified
that
he
said
in
the
course
of
an
argument
between
him
and
one
of
the
men
who
was
forming
a
dual
union,
a
rival
union
within
the
organization.
he
--
this
man
testified
that
bryson
said
to
him
in
the
course
of
an
angry
exchange.
“if
you
are
referring
to
me,
i’m
still
a
communist
and
proud
of
it.”
there
is
another
piece
of
testimony
that
was
given
by
another
person
who
in
the
course
of
--
who
was
expelled
from
the
union
or
was
in
the
process
of
being
expelled.
there
was
an
argument
about
whether
or
not
bryson
was
discriminating
against
him
or
ordering
him
to
be
discriminated
against
in
regard
of
getting
union
jobs.
and
the
man
testified
that
what
you
have
to
do
to
get
a
job
around
here,
to
be
a
party
member
of
something
of
that
kind
and
he
said
that
might
help
and
in
reply
to
another
question
after
bryson
said
when
he
was
accused,
“are
you
still
a
member?”
he
said,
“yes
and
i’m
proud
of
it.”
that’s
the
evidence.
now,
the
district
court
told
the
jury
what,
based
on
the
record,
what’s
the
kind
of
evidence
was
that
existed
when
bryson
was
a
member
of
the
party
and
he
told
the
jury
that
they
should
take
him
to
consideration
of
whether
or
not
he
held
office
or
official
position
on
the
communist
party
whether
he
have
ever
attended
and
participated
communist
party
meetings.
whether
or
not
he
took
instruction
from
communist
party
leaders,
whether
he
participated
in
distributing
literature,
whether
he
solicited
members
for
the
party,
whether
or
not
he
cooperated
closely
with
and
worked
for
there
benefit
and
so
on.
there
was
evidence
that
during
the
period
of
executive
membership,
of
his
membership
between
1937
and
1947,
there
was
evidence
that
these
were
the
activities
in
which
he
engaged.
there
was
no
evidence
i
might
say
that
he
ever
advocated
there
was
ever
present
when
they
was
advocated
or
that
he
ever
runs
to
it
in
whatever
portion
of
the
communist
party
he
was
associated
with.
that
there
was
forbidden
doctrine
or
policy
advocating
the
further
or
that
he
himself
believed
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
united
states
by
force
surveillance
and
of
course
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
case
itself
offered
by
the
government.
to
establish
what
the
teachings
of
the
communist
party
were,
what
their
doctrines
were,
what
their
policies
were,
what
their
objects
were?
the
case
went
to
the
jury
on
the
sole
question
of
whether
nor
he
was
a
member
or
affiliated
with
the
communist
party
without
any
evidence
to
indicate.
either
he
understood
it
to
be
based
on
his
associations
or
what
the
party
itself
stood
for
in
fact
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
government.
mr.
richard
gladstein
all
of
the
arguments
that
are
offered
now
were
addressed
to
the
courtroom
when
the
case
was
tried.
that
is
we
addressed
these
arguments
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
the
arguments.
this
court
did
not
grant
a
position
for
certiorari.
we
saw
twice
first
after
the
original
conviction
was
upheld
and
i
should
say
that
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
that
we
filed
with
the
court
of
appeals
calling
their
attention
of
the
fact
that
in
their
first
decision,
we
thought
they
were
establishing
de
novo
law.
they
reiterated
and
they
said
i’ve
copied
on
the
sentence
from
their
opinion
which
is
referred
to
in
our
brief
as
well
as
in
the
government’s.
they
answer
this
by
saying
that
although
it
was
true
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
case
of
active
affiliation,
it
didn’t
have
to
be
any.
they
said
affiliation
and
this
is
the
quote,
“affiliation
is
a
relationship
that
can
exist
even
when
not
manifested
by
activity.”
as
to
the
argument
that
we
advanced
that
had
to
be
some
showing
that
the
communist
party
stood
for
either
a
calling,
political
strikes
which
was
the
purpose
of
section
9
(h)
according
to
the
legislative
history
congress
wanted
to
inhibit
the
threat
that
political
strikes
might
be
called
in
the
labor
movements.
there
was
no
evidence
of
anything
of
that
sort
either
as
to
bryson
or
as
party
but
specifically
as
to
bryson.
never
had
he
advocated
or
suggested
or
anything
of
that
sort,
although
he
was
being
found
and
in
fact
guilty
because
congress
assumed
that
anybody
found
to
have
been
affiliated
with
the
communist
party
was
necessarily
presenting
threat
to
the
country
that
he
would
throw
the
country
into
political
strikes.
the
court
of
appeals
answered
that
argument
by
saying
that
the
requirement
of
adherence
to
communist
party
purposes
was
covered
by
the
instruction
to
the
jury
that
said
in
effect
affiliation
is
a
very
difficult
concept
to
define,
i
tell
you
in
essence
that
its
everything
but
membership
been
named
only
and
suggested
that
it
is
comparable
to
the
relationship
between
a
man
and
a
woman
who
are
not
married.
there
was
no
instruction
to
the
jury
advising
that
affiliation
could
be
found
only
if
there
was
some
evidence
that
bryson
adhered
to
some
forbidden
doctrine
or
that
he
advance
some
policy
of
believing
some
policy.
whether
it
be
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
violence
or
the
calling
of
political
strikes.
now,
this
was
the
evidence
against
the
man
and
nothing
else.
he
did
not
take
the
stand.
we’ve
tried
to
show
in
our
brief
why.
it
was
the
practice
then
and
it
may
still
be
that
in
cases
of
this
kind
or
any
kind
perhaps
where
a
person
has
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
it
is
uniformly
the
practice
of
the
prosecutor
to
inquire
on
cross-examination
for
the
names
of
other
persons
who
were
in
the
party
at
the
time
that
the
witness
was.
it
was
clear
at
the
time
and
we
set
forth
in
detail
the
reasons
that
if
he
were
asked
questions
of
that
kind
and
if
he
declined
to
become
an
informer,
the
person
whose
he
had
known
long
years
ago
in
the
communist
party
that
he
would
be
sentence
to
a
jail
term
for
contempt
of
court
by
the
trial
judge
and
of
course
that
would
take
place
on
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
in
he
had
any
chance
of
becoming
acquitted
he
would
lose
it
with
a
thing
like
that
happening
as
well
as
gaining
a
jail-term.
but
there’s
some
things
to
some
man
that
are
even
more
important
than
the
risk
of
spending
a
term
of
years
in
prison
and
one
of
them
as
a
matter
of
point.
bryson
chose
not
to
testify
in
order
to
avoid
being
placed
in
the
dilemma
of
having
to
become
either
an
informer
or
showing
disrespect
for
the
court
by
declining
to
answer
questions
that
he
would
be
ordered
to
answer.
in
the
absence
of
bryson’s
testimony
because
he
couldn’t
under
those
circumstances,
he
was
not
a
free
agent
to
get
up
and
either
deny
those
statements
that
he
claim
had
not
been
made
that
were
attributed
or
if
he
made
some
of
them
to
explain
the
context
to
them
which
they
were
made
so
that
the
jury
could
know
what
he
as
doing,
what
he
was
saying
in
the
absence
of
his
own
ability
to
testify.
in
the
presence
of
no
evidence
by
the
prosecution
at
all
concerning
association
of
activities,
association
of
times
or
any
kind
with
the
party,
we
did
what
we
considered
the
next
best
thing.
fourteen
witnesses,
reputable
people
from
various
walks
of
the
community
were
called
and
testified
that
he
have
to
enjoy
an
excellent
reputation
for
truth,
honesty,
and
integrity.
his
record
of
having
sailed
on
the
seas
for
many,
many
years
and
being
subject
to
the
united
states
coast
guard
regulations
of
course
was
a
fact
he
had
never
been
arrested
on
any
charge
either
a
charge
of
violating
a
regulation
or
for
that
matter
a
violation
of
any
law.
we
also
did
this
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
yes,
well
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
i’m
sorry
i
failed
to
make
myself
sufficiently
clear.
it
is
because
[voice
overlap].
yes,
thank
you
very
much.
it’s
because
the
governments
realize
on
the
decision
in
dennis
to
constitute
a
barrier
to
bryson
having
standing
in
this
case
to
be
heard.
that
i
considered
important
for
the
court.
i
know
i
can’t
attack
the
finding
of
guilt
and
i’m
not
doing
that.
i’m
not
seeking
that.
there’s
no,
nothing
like
that
has
being
done.
but
i
would
think
that
it’s
relevant
to
the
exercise
of
discretion
if
that’s
what
it’s
involved
if
dennis
is
a
relevant
decision
to
consider
here.
that
will
be
important
to
consider
what
the
record
was,
whatever
the
jury
found.
what
the
record
was
concerning
bryson
so
as
to
determine
whether
he
compares
with
or
contrasts
with
the
defendants
of
the
dennis
case.
and
i
wanted
to
--
one
more
thing
concerning
what
happened
there
and
that
was
this.
we
called
as
a
witness
for
the
defense
the
agent
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
who
was
in
charge
of
the
prosecution
against
the
bryson,
and
he
testified
that
under
cover
informants
and
agents
of
the
fbi
were
and
have
been
throughout
this
period
before
and
after
1947
within
this
group
that
bryson
at
one
time
had
been
a
member
of.
that
no
--
none
of
this
informants,
none
of
these
agents
testified
and
nobody
came
forward
to
testify
against
bryson.
now,
i
realize
that’s
consistent
with
a
policy
decision
by
the
fbi
that
it
did
not
want
for
reasons
of
its
own
which
it
certainly
has
a
right
to
make.
he
did
not
want
to
reveal
the
identity
of
someone
who
was
in
that
section
but
its
also
consistent
with
the
assertion
that
bryson
has
steadfastly
made
from
the
beginning
and
has
never
deviated
from
that
he
was
innocent,
that
he
was
neither
a
member
nor
affiliated
with
the
communist
party
at
any
time
after
1947.
mr.
richard
gladstein
i’ll
turn
away
from
that.
mr.
richard
gladstein
i’m
sorry.
mr.
richard
gladstein
i’m
sorry.
no,
i
think
that
the
basic
distinction
between
those
cases
and
this
is
that
those
are
cases
that
deal
with
money
transaction.
we
are
talking
here
about
a
statute
that
involves
the
political
liberties
of
the
individual.
we
are
talking
about
rights
of
the
caliber
that
the
first
amendment
protects
rights
that
are
embraced
within
the
provision
that
prohibits
the
passing.
absolutely
prohibits
the
passing
of
bills
of
attainder.
i
do
not
think
that
this
court’s
decisions
can
possibly
equate
cases
like
the
kapp,
those
decisions
which
we
treat
in
our
brief
at
all
with
what
this
court
again
and
again
has
said
to
be
rights
that
are
enshrined.
i
didn’t
realize
that
i
was
taking
up
so
much
time
and
i’m
sorry
about
that.
but
i’d
better
make
my
points
rather
fast.
this
case
i
think
is
controlled
by
brown,
united
states
against
brown.
the
statute
as
we
took
pains
to
show
in
our
brief
by
calling
from
the
government’s
brief
in
brown.
there
the
government
argued
that
9
(h)
and
504
were
enacted
to
serve
the
same
purpose,
same
substance,
only
the
little
difference
in
form
and
they
were
pains
to
show
that
the
force
exerted
by
9
(h)
was
just
as
forceful
just
as
effective
just
as
punitive
as
504.
if
that
was
true
then
it’s
equally
true
today,
504,
i
submit
is
controlling
dennis
for
the
reasons
i
--
i’m
sorry
i
took
so
much
time
to
try
to
develop
without
a
success
would
not
on
the
facts
of
these
case
warrant
or
would
not
justify
the
court
in
preventing
bryson
from
being
hurt
and
moreover,
in
any
event
there
are
the
post
conviction
statutes
which
entitle
him
by
congressional
enactment.
mr.
richard
gladstein
your
honor,
well
i
thought
i
have
used
all
my
time?
mr.
richard
gladstein
i’ll
try
to
take
less.
i
think
the
basic
inquiry
that
i
sensed
here
i
hope
in
our
brief,
that
inquiry
is
this.
does
congress
have
to
pay
attention
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
congress
makes
the
laws.
it
has
a
right
to
make
laws
of
general
application.
it
has
the
right
and
it
does
have
a
duty
to
pass
those
laws.
they’ve
got
to
be
general
laws.
what
right
does
congress
have
at
anytime
under
any
government
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
well,
i
can’t
recall
your
honor
whether
they
were
all
presented.
i’m
sure
they
were.
i’m
sure
they
were
all
rejected
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
never
were
heard
here.
this
court
never
granted
the
position
for
certiorari.
congress
passed
along
that
we
suggest
clearly
violated
the
prohibition
against
bills
of
attainder.
now,
if
that’s
true.
if
that
law
is
unconstitutional
or
for
other
reasons,
first
and
fifth
amendments
which
we
argued
then
it
seems
to
me
the
threshold
inquiry
is
where
you
stop
to
the
minute
you
determine
that
congress
has
offended
the
constitution.
if
that’s
true
than
congress’
enactment
should
be
nullified
and
it
doesn’t
matter
at
all
what
the
citizen
is
required
to
do
under
the
coercion
of
unconstitutional
statute.
it
was
suggested
that
suppose
congress
did
this
to
the
republican
party
and
counsel
said
he’d
have
more
trouble.
but
supposing
it
is
a
socialist
party.
mr.
justice
jackson
in
the
douds
case
have
--
have
no
trouble
saying
that
the
congress
can’t
do
this
with
the
republican
party
of
the
democratic
party
or
the
socialist
party.
we
know
from
history
that
the
socialists
were
expelled
after
being
lawfully
elected
to
the
new
york
legislature.
congress
has
no
more
right
and
the
states
have
no
more
right
to
pass
a
bill
that
lumps
all
of
the
people
in
a
political
group
no
matter
what
there
opinions
are
and
precisely
because
they’re
unorthodox,
hated,
unpopular,
precisely
those
are
entitled
to
the
protections
of
the
bill
of
attainder
in
the
first
amendment
and
it
must
have
been
for
those
reasons
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
put
those
provisions.
mr.
richard
gladstein
no,
your
honor
is
talking
about
section
1001.
but
this
case
is
based
upon
the
underlying
statute
of
9
(h).
without
section
9
(h)
or
some
other
section
of
law,
without
some
other
section
of
law,
1001
has
no
meaning
in
itself.
congress
can’t
just
pass
a
law
saying
answering
any
question
that
anybody
ever
asked
you,
you
must
be
connected
to
some
power
that
congress
has.
in
this
case,
utilizing
the
commerce
power
or
purporting
to
do
so,
congress
passed
section
9
(h)
and
then
it
simply
used
as
an
alternative
method
of
permitting
prosecution
or
enforcement,
the
use
of
1001.
it
could
just
as
easily
have
put
such
a
provision
in
9
(h).
it
does
it
all
the
time.
mr.
richard
gladstein
why,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
gladstein
i
suggest
that
the
more
basic
question
is
that
when
dealing
with
its
citizens,
congress
has
no
right
to
enact
the
statute
which
deprives
them
of
their
constitutional
liberties
particularly
in
the
field
of
politics.
mr.
richard
gladstein
that’s
what
they
say
and
if
this
court
should
ever
close
its
doors
in
that
kind
of
a
situation,
then
the
constitution
would
have
lost
its
vitality
for
many,
many
people
in
the
country.
mr.
richard
gladstein
mr.
justice
harlan
haven’t
you
assumed
part
of
--
in
your
statement
when
you
said
an
agency
that
has
jurisdiction
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
well,
it
is
my
contention
that
there
just
isn’t
any
jurisdiction
if
the
statute
upon
which
power
is
being
exerted
is
itself
violated
with
the
constitution.
mr.
richard
gladstein
all
that
history
shows
that
the
bills
of
attainder
in
england
and
in
the
colonies
were
precisely
used
and
that’s
the
one
distinguishing
feature
about
them.
they
were
all
politically
inspired
and
utilized
against
political
groups.
mr.
richard
gladstein
well,
this
court
has
reviewed
cases
of
both
types
in
unites
states
against
brown
to
show
their
unconstitutionality,
but
here
of
course,
we’re
told
by
counsel
that
a
year
before
my
client
filed
the
affidavit,
this
court
had
held
that
9
(h)
was
constitutional.
mr.
richard
gladstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
brings
into
question,
the
constitutionality
of
section
9
(h)
of
the
taft-hartley
act
of
1947.
that
act
provided
in
substance
that
before
a
labor
union
could
resort
to
the
facilities
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
each
of
its
officers
most
annually
signed
in
filing
non-communist
affidavit.
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute
was
upheld
in
1950
in
the
case
of
american
communications
association
against
douds.
the
chief
opinion
was
written
by
chief
justice
vinson
in
which
two
other
members
of
the
court
concurred,
justices
frankfurter
and
jackson
wrote
separate
opinions,
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
mr.
justice
black
dissented
on
a
number
of
grounds
including
explicitly
an
expression
of
his
view
of
section
9
(h)
was
a
bill
of
attainder
and
therefore
violated
the
article
i
section
9
of
the
constitution.
congress,
it
appears
was
not
satisfied
with
its
experience
under
section
9
(h)
and
12
years
after
its
passage,
nine
years
after
this
court
was
persuaded
to
sustain
it.
the
congress
have
repealed
that
law
and
replaced
it
with
section
504
of
the
labor
management
relations
act.
that
section
provided
that
it
was
a
crime
for
a
man
simultaneously
to
hold
union
office
and
to
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
that
statute
was
held
unconstitutional
by
this
court
in
united
states
against
archie
brown,
1965
in
an
opinion
written
by
the
chief
justice,
four
other
members
of
the
court
concurring
in
the
opinion
on
the
expressed
ground
of
section
504
was
unconstitutional
bill
of
attainder.
one
of
the
questions
certified
in
this
case
is
whether
in
the
comparative
light
of
american
communications
association
versus
doubts
and
united
states
versus
brown,
section
9
(h)
is
constitutional.
let
me
say
a
few
words
about
the
background
of
this
case
in
order
to
put
the
other
two
certified
questions
in
perspective.
petitioner
here
was
one
time
the
president
of
a
small
maritime
labor
union
numbering
some
3,000
members
who
served
on
vessels
plying
in
and
out
of
pacific
coast
port
in
the
steward’s
department
of
those
ships.
in
1951,
he
signed
and
filed
the
affidavit
as
required
--
that
was
required
at
the
time
under
taft-hartley
law.
the
union
was
and
had
been
for
some
time
engaged
in
the
bitter
jurisdictional
dispute
which
ultimately
led
to
the
dissolution
of
the
organization
itself.
now,
the
affidavit
that
he
filed
was
a
printed
form.
but
the
labor
board
supplied
and
it
recited
three
basic
things.
it
recited
that
the
files
at
the
time
he
signed
did
not
then
support
any
organization
that
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force,
violation
or
other
unconstitutional
or
illegal
means.
it
provided
second
that
he
said
he
was
then
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party
specifically
naming
the
communist
party
in
the
second
portion.
it
provided
third,
that
he
was
not
then
affiliate
for
the
communist
party.
in
1954,
almost
three
yeas
after
the
filing
of
the
1951
affidavit
although
i
should
state
that
in
1952
bryson
filed
the
affidavit.
he
did
the
same
in
1953
and
again
in
1954
if
my
memory
served
me
correctly,
even
after
he
was
indicted
on
the
1951
affidavit.
he
was
charged
in
the
indictment
with
three
counts
of
violation,
all
three
of
the
portions
that
i
have
mentioned
.prior
to
the
trial,
the
government
dismissed
the
count
that
charged
him
of
supporting
an
organization
that
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government.
he
went
to
trial
on
the
counts
concerning
membership
and
concerning
affiliation.
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
holding
or
i
should
say
that
this
was
brought
under
the
false
statement
statute
which
it
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
in
the
petition.
jury
returned
the
verdict
holding
that
when
he
swore
that
he
was
not
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
he
was
not
falsely
swearing.
on
the
other
hand,
it
returned
the
verdict
holding
that
he
did
violate
the
law
when
he
swore
that
he
was
not
then
affiliated
for
the
communist
party.
bryson
was
sentence
to
five
years
in
prison
and
a
fine
of
$10,000
which
was
the
maximum.
and
in
addition,
the
trial
judge
provided
expressly
that
he
could
be
subject
to
further
imprisonment
in
the
event
that
he
failed
to
pay
the
fine.
he
served
nearly
two
years
of
his
term
and
then
was
paroled.
and
in
the
intervening
years
he
has
managed
to
pay
$2,000
of
the
$10,000
fine
but
the
there
is
a
balance
of
$8,000.
shortly
before
we
filed
a
petition
in
the
district
court
that
commenced
the
proceedings
that
are
now
here,
the
government
noticed
the
taking
of
bryson’s
deposition
of
the
original
criminal
proceeding
and
did
take
his
--
the
position
seeking
assets
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
the
collection
of
the
$8,000
balance.
and
thereafter,
the
government
filed
a
civil
action
in
the
federal
district
court
in
san
francisco
seeking
judgment
for
the
$8,000.
a
week
or
two
after
that,
bryson’s
petition
was
filed
with
the
district
court
seeking
a
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
or
relief
under
the
other
applicable
post-conviction
statutes.
one
of
the
basic
grounds
upon
which
that
relief
was
sought
was
the
allegation
that
under
united
states
versus
brown,
the
constitutional
basis
of
section
9
(h)
had
been
eroded
along
with
other
decisions
that
it
was
constitutionally
infirmed,
that
it
should
be
controlled
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
united
states
against
brown
and
therefore
that
petition
of
original
conviction
had
been
unconstitutionally
obtained.
the
district
judge
granted
petition
in
all
respects
except
not
granting
the
prayer
for
a
return
of
the
$2,000
that
bryson
has
paid
to
the
government
on
his
fine.
the
government
took
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
ninth
circuit
and
that
court
in
a
per
curiam
decision
reversed
holding
that
bryson
was
precluded
for
bringing
his
petition
by
reason
of
a
decision
of
this
court
in
dennis
versus
the
united
states.
that
case
was
a
case
in
which
this
court
declined
to
review
a
challenge
of
constitutionality
against
section
9
(h)
upon
the
ground
for
the
petitions
in
that
case
were
shown
to
have
been
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
to
deceive
and
to
the
defraud
the
government
and
therefore
that
they
had
lost
standing.
the
court
of
appeals
holding
that
dennis
presented
an
insuperable
obstacle
to
us
declined
the
test
on
the
other
questions
and
reversed.
the
other
two
questions
presented
and
certified
here
then
are:
one,
whether
the
petitioner
is
precluded
by
reason
of
this
court’s
decision
in
dennis
from
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
9
(h).
the
other
is
whether
the
petitioner
qualifies
regardless
of
dennis
upon
the
ground
that
it’s
inapplicable
in
as
much
as
this
is
a
post-conviction
proceeding
and
under
the
all
writs
section
or
under
the
other
section
providing
for
such
relief,
he
would
qualify
for
this
relief.
mr.
richard
gladstein
yes,
i
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
i
know.
i
can
see
that.
yes,
your
honor.
however,
the
vitality
of
it
still
affects
bryson
and
as
hope
to
argue
also
affects
to
its
detriment
to
the
bill
of
attainder
provision
in
our
constitution.
now,
let
me
say
something
about
the
petitioner
of
the
evidence
here.
because
i
suppose
in
the
last
analysis,
this
court
is
not
going
to
look
nearly
at
forms
as
the
government
invites
it
to
do
and
say
well,
in
dennis
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
defraud
and
bryson’s
case
the
jury
found
that
he
lied
about
whether
or
not
he
was
affiliated
with
the
communist
party
and
therefore
they
are
on
a
par,
this
is
the
government’s
argument.
i
would
suppose
that
if
dennis
lays
down
a
rule,
the
court
created
by
which
the
court
will
determine
in
its
own
discretion
whether
or
not
a
particular
person
is
entitled
to
be
heard
has
standing
to
be
heard.
one
must
look
at
the
character
of
the
particular
petitioner
in
so
far
at
least
as
the
record
and
the
evidence
would
seem
to
show.
now
in
petitioner’s
case,
the
facts
are
these.
there’s
no
question
that
for
a
period
of
ten
years
between
1937
and
1947,
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
he
was
an
officer
of
that
party.
he
was
an
officer
under
what
was
called
the
waterfront
section
level
in
san
francisco
and
he
was
an
officer
on
a
state
level,
state
committee.
there
was
no
suggestion
in
this
record
that
bryson
never
tried
to
concede
the
fact
that
his
membership
or
holding
office
in
the
communist
party
when
he
was
a
member
of
it.
now
in
1947,
he
terminated
his
associations
and
there
is
no
evidence.
there
was
no
evidence
of
the
trial
to
sustain
any
charge
that
there
was
an
active
relationship
between
him
and
the
party
thereafter.
the
evidence
upon
which
he
was
convicted
not
of
membership
but
of
association
of
affiliation
summarize
by
the
government
in
its
brief,
and
i
assume
that
they
have
called
from
it
as
much
as
there
is
and
this
is
one
of
the
matters
to
it
that
comes
on
pages
5
and
6
of
the
government’s
brief.
first,
he
said
that
in
1949,
at
an
open
union
convention,
he
--
i
quote
what
they
say,
“premised
--
he
refused
to
see
that
delegate
to
a
union
conversion
premised
on
the
delegate’s
failure
to
accept
an
opportunity
to
join
the
communist
party.”
so
not
only
was
that
two
years
before
he
filed
the
affidavit
in
this
case.
but
i
mentioned
that
this
is
the
type
of
evidence
on
which
the
affiliation
count
was
based.
mr.
richard
gladstein
there
was
no
announcement.
there
was
a
cessation
of
all
relationship,
all
active
relationship
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
in
1947,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
gladstein
this
and
two
or
three
other
statements
attributed
to
him.
yes,
one
in
1949
and
several
in
1951.
one
of
which
as
the
government
correctly
points
out
was
two
months
after
he
had
filed
his
affidavit
in
1951.
he
then
is
supposed
to
use
--
it
was
testified
that
he
said
in
the
course
of
an
argument
between
him
and
one
of
the
men
who
was
forming
a
dual
union,
a
rival
union
within
the
organization.
he
--
this
man
testified
that
bryson
said
to
him
in
the
course
of
an
angry
exchange.
“if
you
are
referring
to
me,
i’m
still
a
communist
and
proud
of
it.”
there
is
another
piece
of
testimony
that
was
given
by
another
person
who
in
the
course
of
--
who
was
expelled
from
the
union
or
was
in
the
process
of
being
expelled.
there
was
an
argument
about
whether
or
not
bryson
was
discriminating
against
him
or
ordering
him
to
be
discriminated
against
in
regard
of
getting
union
jobs.
and
the
man
testified
that
what
you
have
to
do
to
get
a
job
around
here,
to
be
a
party
member
of
something
of
that
kind
and
he
said
that
might
help
and
in
reply
to
another
question
after
bryson
said
when
he
was
accused,
“are
you
still
a
member?”
he
said,
“yes
and
i’m
proud
of
it.”
that’s
the
evidence.
now,
the
district
court
told
the
jury
what,
based
on
the
record,
what’s
the
kind
of
evidence
was
that
existed
when
bryson
was
a
member
of
the
party
and
he
told
the
jury
that
they
should
take
him
to
consideration
of
whether
or
not
he
held
office
or
official
position
on
the
communist
party
whether
he
have
ever
attended
and
participated
communist
party
meetings.
whether
or
not
he
took
instruction
from
communist
party
leaders,
whether
he
participated
in
distributing
literature,
whether
he
solicited
members
for
the
party,
whether
or
not
he
cooperated
closely
with
and
worked
for
there
benefit
and
so
on.
there
was
evidence
that
during
the
period
of
executive
membership,
of
his
membership
between
1937
and
1947,
there
was
evidence
that
these
were
the
activities
in
which
he
engaged.
there
was
no
evidence
i
might
say
that
he
ever
advocated
there
was
ever
present
when
they
was
advocated
or
that
he
ever
runs
to
it
in
whatever
portion
of
the
communist
party
he
was
associated
with.
that
there
was
forbidden
doctrine
or
policy
advocating
the
further
or
that
he
himself
believed
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
united
states
by
force
surveillance
and
of
course
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
case
itself
offered
by
the
government.
to
establish
what
the
teachings
of
the
communist
party
were,
what
their
doctrines
were,
what
their
policies
were,
what
their
objects
were?
the
case
went
to
the
jury
on
the
sole
question
of
whether
nor
he
was
a
member
or
affiliated
with
the
communist
party
without
any
evidence
to
indicate.
either
he
understood
it
to
be
based
on
his
associations
or
what
the
party
itself
stood
for
in
fact
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
government.
mr.
richard
gladstein
all
of
the
arguments
that
are
offered
now
were
addressed
to
the
courtroom
when
the
case
was
tried.
that
is
we
addressed
these
arguments
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
the
arguments.
this
court
did
not
grant
a
position
for
certiorari.
we
saw
twice
first
after
the
original
conviction
was
upheld
and
i
should
say
that
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
that
we
filed
with
the
court
of
appeals
calling
their
attention
of
the
fact
that
in
their
first
decision,
we
thought
they
were
establishing
de
novo
law.
they
reiterated
and
they
said
i’ve
copied
on
the
sentence
from
their
opinion
which
is
referred
to
in
our
brief
as
well
as
in
the
government’s.
they
answer
this
by
saying
that
although
it
was
true
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
case
of
active
affiliation,
it
didn’t
have
to
be
any.
they
said
affiliation
and
this
is
the
quote,
“affiliation
is
a
relationship
that
can
exist
even
when
not
manifested
by
activity.”
as
to
the
argument
that
we
advanced
that
had
to
be
some
showing
that
the
communist
party
stood
for
either
a
calling,
political
strikes
which
was
the
purpose
of
section
9
(h)
according
to
the
legislative
history
congress
wanted
to
inhibit
the
threat
that
political
strikes
might
be
called
in
the
labor
movements.
there
was
no
evidence
of
anything
of
that
sort
either
as
to
bryson
or
as
party
but
specifically
as
to
bryson.
never
had
he
advocated
or
suggested
or
anything
of
that
sort,
although
he
was
being
found
and
in
fact
guilty
because
congress
assumed
that
anybody
found
to
have
been
affiliated
with
the
communist
party
was
necessarily
presenting
threat
to
the
country
that
he
would
throw
the
country
into
political
strikes.
the
court
of
appeals
answered
that
argument
by
saying
that
the
requirement
of
adherence
to
communist
party
purposes
was
covered
by
the
instruction
to
the
jury
that
said
in
effect
affiliation
is
a
very
difficult
concept
to
define,
i
tell
you
in
essence
that
its
everything
but
membership
been
named
only
and
suggested
that
it
is
comparable
to
the
relationship
between
a
man
and
a
woman
who
are
not
married.
there
was
no
instruction
to
the
jury
advising
that
affiliation
could
be
found
only
if
there
was
some
evidence
that
bryson
adhered
to
some
forbidden
doctrine
or
that
he
advance
some
policy
of
believing
some
policy.
whether
it
be
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
violence
or
the
calling
of
political
strikes.
now,
this
was
the
evidence
against
the
man
and
nothing
else.
he
did
not
take
the
stand.
we’ve
tried
to
show
in
our
brief
why.
it
was
the
practice
then
and
it
may
still
be
that
in
cases
of
this
kind
or
any
kind
perhaps
where
a
person
has
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
it
is
uniformly
the
practice
of
the
prosecutor
to
inquire
on
cross-examination
for
the
names
of
other
persons
who
were
in
the
party
at
the
time
that
the
witness
was.
it
was
clear
at
the
time
and
we
set
forth
in
detail
the
reasons
that
if
he
were
asked
questions
of
that
kind
and
if
he
declined
to
become
an
informer,
the
person
whose
he
had
known
long
years
ago
in
the
communist
party
that
he
would
be
sentence
to
a
jail
term
for
contempt
of
court
by
the
trial
judge
and
of
course
that
would
take
place
on
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
in
he
had
any
chance
of
becoming
acquitted
he
would
lose
it
with
a
thing
like
that
happening
as
well
as
gaining
a
jail-term.
but
there’s
some
things
to
some
man
that
are
even
more
important
than
the
risk
of
spending
a
term
of
years
in
prison
and
one
of
them
as
a
matter
of
point.
bryson
chose
not
to
testify
in
order
to
avoid
being
placed
in
the
dilemma
of
having
to
become
either
an
informer
or
showing
disrespect
for
the
court
by
declining
to
answer
questions
that
he
would
be
ordered
to
answer.
in
the
absence
of
bryson’s
testimony
because
he
couldn’t
under
those
circumstances,
he
was
not
a
free
agent
to
get
up
and
either
deny
those
statements
that
he
claim
had
not
been
made
that
were
attributed
or
if
he
made
some
of
them
to
explain
the
context
to
them
which
they
were
made
so
that
the
jury
could
know
what
he
as
doing,
what
he
was
saying
in
the
absence
of
his
own
ability
to
testify.
in
the
presence
of
no
evidence
by
the
prosecution
at
all
concerning
association
of
activities,
association
of
times
or
any
kind
with
the
party,
we
did
what
we
considered
the
next
best
thing.
fourteen
witnesses,
reputable
people
from
various
walks
of
the
community
were
called
and
testified
that
he
have
to
enjoy
an
excellent
reputation
for
truth,
honesty,
and
integrity.
his
record
of
having
sailed
on
the
seas
for
many,
many
years
and
being
subject
to
the
united
states
coast
guard
regulations
of
course
was
a
fact
he
had
never
been
arrested
on
any
charge
either
a
charge
of
violating
a
regulation
or
for
that
matter
a
violation
of
any
law.
we
also
did
this
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
yes,
well
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
i’m
sorry
i
failed
to
make
myself
sufficiently
clear.
it
is
because
[voice
overlap].
yes,
thank
you
very
much.
it’s
because
the
governments
realize
on
the
decision
in
dennis
to
constitute
a
barrier
to
bryson
having
standing
in
this
case
to
be
heard.
that
i
considered
important
for
the
court.
i
know
i
can’t
attack
the
finding
of
guilt
and
i’m
not
doing
that.
i’m
not
seeking
that.
there’s
no,
nothing
like
that
has
being
done.
but
i
would
think
that
it’s
relevant
to
the
exercise
of
discretion
if
that’s
what
it’s
involved
if
dennis
is
a
relevant
decision
to
consider
here.
that
will
be
important
to
consider
what
the
record
was,
whatever
the
jury
found.
what
the
record
was
concerning
bryson
so
as
to
determine
whether
he
compares
with
or
contrasts
with
the
defendants
of
the
dennis
case.
and
i
wanted
to
--
one
more
thing
concerning
what
happened
there
and
that
was
this.
we
called
as
a
witness
for
the
defense
the
agent
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
who
was
in
charge
of
the
prosecution
against
the
bryson,
and
he
testified
that
under
cover
informants
and
agents
of
the
fbi
were
and
have
been
throughout
this
period
before
and
after
1947
within
this
group
that
bryson
at
one
time
had
been
a
member
of.
that
no
--
none
of
this
informants,
none
of
these
agents
testified
and
nobody
came
forward
to
testify
against
bryson.
now,
i
realize
that’s
consistent
with
a
policy
decision
by
the
fbi
that
it
did
not
want
for
reasons
of
its
own
which
it
certainly
has
a
right
to
make.
he
did
not
want
to
reveal
the
identity
of
someone
who
was
in
that
section
but
its
also
consistent
with
the
assertion
that
bryson
has
steadfastly
made
from
the
beginning
and
has
never
deviated
from
that
he
was
innocent,
that
he
was
neither
a
member
nor
affiliated
with
the
communist
party
at
any
time
after
1947.
mr.
richard
gladstein
i’ll
turn
away
from
that.
mr.
richard
gladstein
i’m
sorry.
mr.
richard
gladstein
i’m
sorry.
no,
i
think
that
the
basic
distinction
between
those
cases
and
this
is
that
those
are
cases
that
deal
with
money
transaction.
we
are
talking
here
about
a
statute
that
involves
the
political
liberties
of
the
individual.
we
are
talking
about
rights
of
the
caliber
that
the
first
amendment
protects
rights
that
are
embraced
within
the
provision
that
prohibits
the
passing.
absolutely
prohibits
the
passing
of
bills
of
attainder.
i
do
not
think
that
this
court’s
decisions
can
possibly
equate
cases
like
the
kapp,
those
decisions
which
we
treat
in
our
brief
at
all
with
what
this
court
again
and
again
has
said
to
be
rights
that
are
enshrined.
i
didn’t
realize
that
i
was
taking
up
so
much
time
and
i’m
sorry
about
that.
but
i’d
better
make
my
points
rather
fast.
this
case
i
think
is
controlled
by
brown,
united
states
against
brown.
the
statute
as
we
took
pains
to
show
in
our
brief
by
calling
from
the
government’s
brief
in
brown.
there
the
government
argued
that
9
(h)
and
504
were
enacted
to
serve
the
same
purpose,
same
substance,
only
the
little
difference
in
form
and
they
were
pains
to
show
that
the
force
exerted
by
9
(h)
was
just
as
forceful
just
as
effective
just
as
punitive
as
504.
if
that
was
true
then
it’s
equally
true
today,
504,
i
submit
is
controlling
dennis
for
the
reasons
i
--
i’m
sorry
i
took
so
much
time
to
try
to
develop
without
a
success
would
not
on
the
facts
of
these
case
warrant
or
would
not
justify
the
court
in
preventing
bryson
from
being
hurt
and
moreover,
in
any
event
there
are
the
post
conviction
statutes
which
entitle
him
by
congressional
enactment.
mr.
richard
gladstein
your
honor,
well
i
thought
i
have
used
all
my
time?
mr.
richard
gladstein
i’ll
try
to
take
less.
i
think
the
basic
inquiry
that
i
sensed
here
i
hope
in
our
brief,
that
inquiry
is
this.
does
congress
have
to
pay
attention
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
congress
makes
the
laws.
it
has
a
right
to
make
laws
of
general
application.
it
has
the
right
and
it
does
have
a
duty
to
pass
those
laws.
they’ve
got
to
be
general
laws.
what
right
does
congress
have
at
anytime
under
any
government
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
well,
i
can’t
recall
your
honor
whether
they
were
all
presented.
i’m
sure
they
were.
i’m
sure
they
were
all
rejected
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
never
were
heard
here.
this
court
never
granted
the
position
for
certiorari.
congress
passed
along
that
we
suggest
clearly
violated
the
prohibition
against
bills
of
attainder.
now,
if
that’s
true.
if
that
law
is
unconstitutional
or
for
other
reasons,
first
and
fifth
amendments
which
we
argued
then
it
seems
to
me
the
threshold
inquiry
is
where
you
stop
to
the
minute
you
determine
that
congress
has
offended
the
constitution.
if
that’s
true
than
congress’
enactment
should
be
nullified
and
it
doesn’t
matter
at
all
what
the
citizen
is
required
to
do
under
the
coercion
of
unconstitutional
statute.
it
was
suggested
that
suppose
congress
did
this
to
the
republican
party
and
counsel
said
he’d
have
more
trouble.
but
supposing
it
is
a
socialist
party.
mr.
justice
jackson
in
the
douds
case
have
--
have
no
trouble
saying
that
the
congress
can’t
do
this
with
the
republican
party
of
the
democratic
party
or
the
socialist
party.
we
know
from
history
that
the
socialists
were
expelled
after
being
lawfully
elected
to
the
new
york
legislature.
congress
has
no
more
right
and
the
states
have
no
more
right
to
pass
a
bill
that
lumps
all
of
the
people
in
a
political
group
no
matter
what
there
opinions
are
and
precisely
because
they’re
unorthodox,
hated,
unpopular,
precisely
those
are
entitled
to
the
protections
of
the
bill
of
attainder
in
the
first
amendment
and
it
must
have
been
for
those
reasons
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
put
those
provisions.
mr.
richard
gladstein
no,
your
honor
is
talking
about
section
1001.
but
this
case
is
based
upon
the
underlying
statute
of
9
(h).
without
section
9
(h)
or
some
other
section
of
law,
without
some
other
section
of
law,
1001
has
no
meaning
in
itself.
congress
can’t
just
pass
a
law
saying
answering
any
question
that
anybody
ever
asked
you,
you
must
be
connected
to
some
power
that
congress
has.
in
this
case,
utilizing
the
commerce
power
or
purporting
to
do
so,
congress
passed
section
9
(h)
and
then
it
simply
used
as
an
alternative
method
of
permitting
prosecution
or
enforcement,
the
use
of
1001.
it
could
just
as
easily
have
put
such
a
provision
in
9
(h).
it
does
it
all
the
time.
mr.
richard
gladstein
why,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
gladstein
i
suggest
that
the
more
basic
question
is
that
when
dealing
with
its
citizens,
congress
has
no
right
to
enact
the
statute
which
deprives
them
of
their
constitutional
liberties
particularly
in
the
field
of
politics.
mr.
richard
gladstein
that’s
what
they
say
and
if
this
court
should
ever
close
its
doors
in
that
kind
of
a
situation,
then
the
constitution
would
have
lost
its
vitality
for
many,
many
people
in
the
country.
mr.
richard
gladstein
mr.
justice
harlan
haven’t
you
assumed
part
of
--
in
your
statement
when
you
said
an
agency
that
has
jurisdiction
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
well,
it
is
my
contention
that
there
just
isn’t
any
jurisdiction
if
the
statute
upon
which
power
is
being
exerted
is
itself
violated
with
the
constitution.
mr.
richard
gladstein
all
that
history
shows
that
the
bills
of
attainder
in
england
and
in
the
colonies
were
precisely
used
and
that’s
the
one
distinguishing
feature
about
them.
they
were
all
politically
inspired
and
utilized
against
political
groups.
mr.
richard
gladstein
well,
this
court
has
reviewed
cases
of
both
types
in
unites
states
against
brown
to
show
their
unconstitutionality,
but
here
of
course,
we’re
told
by
counsel
that
a
year
before
my
client
filed
the
affidavit,
this
court
had
held
that
9
(h)
was
constitutional.
