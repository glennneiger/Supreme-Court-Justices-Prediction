john
m.
harlan
are
all
that
congress
has
done
in
years
you
say
is
--
are
dealing
with
the
government
and
a
like?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don’t
think
that’s
actually
the
way
i’m
looking
at.
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
that
the
congress
has
done
here
is
to
say
irrespective
of
whether
to
translate
it
a
little
bit.
irrespective
of
whether
what
they
did
in
section
9
(h)
is
good
or
bad.
if
you’re
living
with
the
government,
you
cannot
lie
to
the
government
as
a
means
of
avoiding
section
9
(h).
if
you
want
to
attack
it,
go
and
attack
it
the
other
way.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
it’s
pretty
broad
statement.
that
would
suppose
the
government’s
position
would
be
the
same
on
mr.
justice
black’s
hypothetical?
it
passes
the
law,
it
violates
the
first
amendment
and
the
prosecution
is
lying
about
to
an
agency
that
has
jurisdiction
whether
it’s
a
republican
party,
the
democratic
party,
the
communist
party
or
anything
else.
congress
has
long
been
inspiring
doing
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
was
thinking
jurisdiction
in
the
broad
sense
punitive,
colorable
jurisdiction
--
