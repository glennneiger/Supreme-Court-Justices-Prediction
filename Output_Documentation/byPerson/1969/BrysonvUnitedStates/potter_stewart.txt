justice
potter
stewart
i
have
a
little
trouble
understanding
mr.
gladstein,
what
the
relevance
of
all
these
is
to
the
issues
now
here
before
the
court,
after
all
the
jury
did
convict
him.
justice
potter
stewart
under
instructions
that
have
been
explicitly
approved
by
this
court
as
i
understand
it
of
violating
of
being
affiliated
with
the
communist
party
at
the
time
that
he
said
he
swore
under
oath
that
he
was
not
so
affiliated?
that’s
a
finding
that
was
appealed.
that’s
the
finding.
that’s
water
over
the
dam.
he
was
convicted.
what
questions
as
to
why
he
might
have
not
testified
in
that
trial
or
what
he’s
motivations
had
been
or
of
interest
but
i
don’t
see
what
relevance
they
have
to
the
issues
now
here
before
this
court
in
this
present
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
assume
that
it
did
make
a
difference,
whether
the
statute
was
constitutional
or
not?
would
you
say
that
he
would
be
barred
from
raising
the
constitutional
question
just
because
he
told
a
lie?
