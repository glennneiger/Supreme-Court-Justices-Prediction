unknown
speaker
when
you
talk
about
the
constitutionality
of
9
(h)
it’s
really
whether
9
(h)
wasn’t
absolute.
unknown
speaker
is
that
no
longer
unquote?
unknown
speaker
let
me
see
if
i
understand
your
argument
in
--
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
what
you’re
saying.
but
when
a
commits
perjury
where
a
statute
requires
that
perjury
be
both
be
made,
that
if
that
statute
is
itself
void
he
is
barred
from
raising
a
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
--
isn’t
that
the
challenge
he
is
making?
it
is
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
but
it
has
not
been
held
unconstitutional
but
he
is
challenging
it
as
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
what
you’re
saying
is
when
a
man
has
come
forth
to
swear
something
under
a
law
which
is
unconstitutional,
he
is
barred
from
raising
the
question
of
that
constitutionality
when
he
is
prosecute
for
perjury.
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
a
statute,
that’s
a
statute.
unknown
speaker
the
statute
said
they
had
to
do
it,
didn’t
he?
unknown
speaker
and
he
had
to
do
it
as
i
understand
that
you’re
saying
that
he
will
know
that
statute
is
unconstitutional,
therefore
has
always
understood
it
with
no
effect.
you
could
prosecute
--
he
is
bar
from
raising
the
question
when
he
is
charged
with
perjury.
well,
i
--
unknown
speaker
well,
if
suppose
it’s
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
it
can’t
make
it.
this
man
can’t
raise
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
depends
if
he
is
the
one
that’s
called
in
the
bench.
unknown
speaker
he
had.
unknown
speaker
that
other
way
also
but
how
can
the
government
in
good
faith
and
good
conscience
and
in
not
in
fraud
tempt
to
prosecute
him
for
perjury
under
statute
which
why
the
oath
that
he
is
charged
with
it
perjuring
himself
on
is
unconstitutional?
for
me,
like
the
government
is
more
fraud
there
than
he
is?
unknown
speaker
which
case
did
--
unknown
speaker
which
case
did
it
hold
it
in?
unknown
speaker
which
case
did
it
hold
that
in?
unknown
speaker
which
dennis
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
point
is
counsel
isn’t
it
at
least
i
thought
it
was
that
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
whether
the
statute
is
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
that
what
you
say
dennis
holds
that
it
just
doesn’t
make
any
difference
even
if
the
statute
is
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
that’s
right.
unknown
speaker
as
i
read
your
brief
you
say
it
doesn’t
make
if
whichever
way
the
constitutional
question
is
decided
is
conviction
for
making
a
false
statement
withstand.
unknown
speaker
but
that’s
maybe
for
the
no
standing,
isn’t
it
rather
than
[voice
overlap]?
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
going
beyond
dennis.
unknown
speaker
or
are
there
any
cases
around
here
that
you
know
of
that
supports
your
--
this
present
theory
of
standing
because
he
really
was
a
bad
fellow,
he
has
to
have
standing
to
raise
this
argument?
unknown
speaker
well,
it’s
the
way
it
sounded
to
me.
unknown
speaker
and
because
he
told
a
lie
he
shouldn’t
be
able
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
make
that
argument
if
it
were
really
true
and
that
statute
run
if
it
would
make
a
difference
under
the
false
statement
statute,
whether
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
or
not.
would
you
still
make
this
standing
argument?
unknown
speaker
mr.
beytagh,
the
conviction
in
this
case
was
for
violation
of
what
titled
18
section
1001?
unknown
speaker
alright,
which
is
not
itself
9
(h)?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
assuming
that,
that
would
apply
to
all
kinds
of
case
this
was
reference
to
false
statement?
you
said
in
order
to
obtain
this
necessary
information.
unknown
speaker
first
amendment
has
some
rights
in
the
constitution,
didn’t
it?
submit
and
bestow
some
rights
on
the
people?
unknown
speaker
with
reference
to
exposing
their
political
views?
unknown
speaker
compelling
them
to
have
one
political
view
rather
than
another?
unknown
speaker
what
was
this
oath
about?
unknown
speaker
suppose
he
had
to
make
an
oath
that
he
was
not
affiliated
with
the
republican
party
and
had
not
cast
the
vote
for
it?
unknown
speaker
will
that
be
required
of
him?
unknown
speaker
why
would
you?
unknown
speaker
it
was
political.
unknown
speaker
but,
congress
has
made
any
findings
yet
that’s
for
them
to
concern
for
justifying
and
interfering
with
the
man’s
political
faith
in
view
of
the
first
amendment,
and
has
--
could
not
make
any
violation
in
my
judgment.
what
he
is
trying
to
do
is
to
challenge
prosecuting
him
from
making
that
statement?
unknown
speaker
you
were
trying
him
for
making
on
his
ground.
you
are
trying
him
for
making
a
statement
which
could
not
be
required
of
him
constitutionally
under
the
law,
and
you
want
to
prosecute
him.
unknown
speaker
which
douds?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
to
stand
on
douds?
unknown
speaker
i
should
think,
i
wouldn’t
want
to
per
se.
unknown
speaker
but
isn’t
your
basic
proposition
mr.
beytagh,
even
if
douds
was
wrong,
even
if
douds
ought
to
be
overruled
nevertheless,
that’s
not
the
issue
that’s
involved
here.
the
issue
here
is
whether
9
(h)
is
constitutional
or
not?
even
if
it
was
unconstitutional,
we’re
dealing
with
an
indictment
under
the
different
statute?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
basic
proposition?
i
just
wonder
why
you
argue
should
depend
on
douds
you
don’t
have
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
you’re
the
one
that
mentioned
douds.
i
wasn’t
the
one
who
mentioned
douds.[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
the
one
that
mentioned
douds
and
that’s
what
you
have
--[laughter]
unknown
speaker
now
you
have
to
defend
it.
unknown
speaker
are
you
arguing
in
the
--
that
dennis
case
should
be
overruled?
unknown
speaker
that
his
contention
is
still
wrong?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
as
you
heard
my
brother
harlan
suggests.
suppose
congress
passes
a
series
of
laws,
as
it
might
well
do
in
some
time
making
you
apply
all
the
kinds
of
relief
with
reference
to
your
political
leads
and
persuasions
and
what
you’ve
done,
is
the
man
then
to
be
denied
the
privilege
of
challenging
at
law
on
the
ground
that
he
lied?
unknown
speaker
may
i
suggest
to
you
that
if
congress
can
do
that
whenever
it
gets
heated
up
over
some
political
question,
it
has
a
way
to
set
millions
of
traps
for
citizens
who
ought
not
to
be
convicted?
unknown
speaker
when
you
talk
about
the
constitutionality
of
9
(h)
it’s
really
whether
9
(h)
wasn’t
absolute.
unknown
speaker
is
that
no
longer
unquote?
unknown
speaker
let
me
see
if
i
understand
your
argument
in
--
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
what
you’re
saying.
but
when
a
commits
perjury
where
a
statute
requires
that
perjury
be
both
be
made,
that
if
that
statute
is
itself
void
he
is
barred
from
raising
a
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
--
isn’t
that
the
challenge
he
is
making?
it
is
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
but
it
has
not
been
held
unconstitutional
but
he
is
challenging
it
as
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
what
you’re
saying
is
when
a
man
has
come
forth
to
swear
something
under
a
law
which
is
unconstitutional,
he
is
barred
from
raising
the
question
of
that
constitutionality
when
he
is
prosecute
for
perjury.
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
a
statute,
that’s
a
statute.
unknown
speaker
the
statute
said
they
had
to
do
it,
didn’t
he?
unknown
speaker
and
he
had
to
do
it
as
i
understand
that
you’re
saying
that
he
will
know
that
statute
is
unconstitutional,
therefore
has
always
understood
it
with
no
effect.
you
could
prosecute
--
he
is
bar
from
raising
the
question
when
he
is
charged
with
perjury.
well,
i
--
unknown
speaker
well,
if
suppose
it’s
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
it
can’t
make
it.
this
man
can’t
raise
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
depends
if
he
is
the
one
that’s
called
in
the
bench.
unknown
speaker
he
had.
unknown
speaker
that
other
way
also
but
how
can
the
government
in
good
faith
and
good
conscience
and
in
not
in
fraud
tempt
to
prosecute
him
for
perjury
under
statute
which
why
the
oath
that
he
is
charged
with
it
perjuring
himself
on
is
unconstitutional?
for
me,
like
the
government
is
more
fraud
there
than
he
is?
unknown
speaker
which
case
did
--
unknown
speaker
which
case
did
it
hold
it
in?
unknown
speaker
which
case
did
it
hold
that
in?
unknown
speaker
which
dennis
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
point
is
counsel
isn’t
it
at
least
i
thought
it
was
that
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
whether
the
statute
is
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
that
what
you
say
dennis
holds
that
it
just
doesn’t
make
any
difference
even
if
the
statute
is
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
that’s
right.
unknown

that’s
going
beyond

there
any

around
here
that

that
supports

and
you

which
douds?

do
you
have
to

douds?
unknown

i
should

mr.

you

you’re

unknown

well,
you
are

that’s
