non-draft
status

considerable

hadn't

justice
hugo
l.

is
it
your
position
that
that
does
not
make
out
what
someone
would
call
a
prima
facie
case,
to
be
that
you
are
a
conscientious
objector?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what

the
ambiguity
of
it.
i
thought
just
reading
through
them,
i
read
all
these
records,
i
thought
that
he
indicated
that
he
had
been
taught
from
the
childhood
not
to
kill
people
he
didn't
believe
in

he
had
conscientious
objections
during

that
he
would
consider
it
murder.
