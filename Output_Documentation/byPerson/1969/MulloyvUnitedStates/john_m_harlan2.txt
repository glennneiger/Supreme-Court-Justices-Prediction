justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
a
couple
of
these
gentlemen
is
kind
of
peripheral
that
(inaudible)
that
it
seemed
to
be
of
two
of
the
boards,
the
two
members
of
the
board
or
one
of
them
said
they
really
didn't
question
as
to
the
man's
sincerity?
justice
john
m.
harlan
money
is
to
what
in
the
world
they
didn't
do?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
all
bound
up
in
it
because
the
consequences
sustaining
your
position
here
is
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
nobody
reviewed
the
underlying
merits
of
this
claim
because
there
is
never
been
reopened.
it
doesn't
get
his
administrative
appeal
and
he
gets
no
judicial
review.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
trouble
is
that
you
said
earlier,
you
can't
tell
what
basis
the
board
went
on.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
justifying
the
set
of
assumptions
which
has
to
be
a
premised
on
the
fact
that
you
cannot
tell
the
specificity
or
any
sense
of
assurance
what
ground
the
board
went
on?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suggest
to
you
that
there
is
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
court
of
appeals
did
indicate
what
he
wanted
–
that
he
did
not
think
that
what
he'd
been
alleged
was
sufficient
to
make
other
prima
facie
case
of
conscientious
objections
and
you
gentlemen,
the
government
in
its
brief
now
concedes
that
in
effect,
the
court
of
appeals
is
in
error
--
in
other
words,
you
concede
that
the
papers
as
i
read
in
your
brief,
the
papers
did
make
out
a
claim
of
conscientious
objection
and
you
have
to
pin
your
argument
on
refusal
to
reopen
on
the
grounds
that
the
board
has
more
power
to
that
and
then
when
it
comes
to
what
that
power
is,
you're
up
again
and
yet
you're
dealing
with
a
record
to
which
on
your
own
statement,
you
say,
you
can't
tell
what
the
board
decided.

john
m.
