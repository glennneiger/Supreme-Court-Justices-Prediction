mr.
robert
allen
sedler
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court?
the
issues
in
this
case,
arise
out
of
the
stated
refusal
of
petitioner
mulloys
selective
service
board
to
reopen
his
classification
and
consider
his
claim
for
conscientious
objector
status.
that's
what
we
are
dealing
with
here,
a
failure
to
reopen.
we
do
not
have
the
case
where
the
board
has
decided
to
claim,
at
least
officially,
on
the
merits
and
where
there
has
been
an
appeal,
or
at
least,
an
opportunity
for
an
appeal,
so
that
the
question
before
this
court
would
be
whether
there
was
a
basis
in
fact
for
the
determination.
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
petitioner
was
a
conscientious
objector
or
whether
there
was
a
basis
in
fact
for
a
substantive
determination
that
he
was
not.
the
issue
is
purely
a
procedural
one.
did
the
petitioner
make
enough
of
a
showing
of
entitlement
to
classification
as
a
conscientious
objector
that
he
was
entitled
to
an
appealable
determination
by
the
board?
i
guess
what
this
case
is
all
about
is
that
the
petitioner
claims,
he
was
entitled
to
a
full-scale
determination
including
the
right
of
appeal.
the
board
summarily
dismissed.
the
first
issue
then
revolves
around
the
summary
dismissal.
the
petitioner
is
contended
throughout
these
proceedings
that
the
board
either
was
required
to
reopen
because
based
on
his
sss
form
150
and
the
letters
and
other
information
submitted
in
support
of
a
claim,
he
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
entitlement
or,
that
what
really
happened
was
that
the
board
in
fact
reopened
deciding
the
claim
against
him
on
the
merits
but
denying
him
the
appeal
to
which
he
was
entitled
by
the
regulations.
in
this
court,
the
government
now
concedes
which
is
a
clear
departure
from
its
position
here
before
that
based
on
the
sss
form
150
and
the
supporting
letters,
the
petitioner
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
entitlement
but
says
the
government,
even
so,
the
board
does
not
have
to
reopen.
i
think
issue
was
joined
on
that
first
point.
the
second
issue
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
no,
your
honor.
this
is
a
point
that
we
have
made
and
that
the
board
did
not
say
why
it
found
that
he
wasn't
a
conscientious
objector.b
ut
the
record
does
clearly
say
what
the
board
did.
the
form
100,
the
phase
form,
falling
the
november
9th
meeting,
says,
“classification
not
reopened”.
now,
following
the
meeting
on
january
11th,
the
sss
form
100
reads
all
information
in
the
file
considered
including
claim
of
conscientious
objector.
the
board
felt
that
information
did
not
warrant
reopening
of
1-a
classification
vote
four
to
nothing.
this
was
also
brought
out
at
the
testimony
both
in
the
civil
trial
and
the
criminal
trial
where
chairman
sherman
stated,
“that
taking
everything
in
the
file.”
assuming
what
he
said
to
be
true,
he
did
not
make
out
a
case
and
we
saw
no
reason
to
reopen
because
it
wasn't
there.
i
think
it
is
very
clear
that
the
board's
reason
for
its
action
was
that
the
petitioner
did
not
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
for
entitlement.
this
was
the
government's
argument
both
in
the
district
court
and
before
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
explicitly
stated
that,
petitioner
did
not
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
and
therefore
the
board
was
not
required
to
reopen.
now,
we
have
contended
all
along,
that
the
only
way
you
could
say,
he
did
not
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
is
to
totally
distort
the
meaning
of
prima
facie
case,
and
say
that
prima
facie
case
means
the
same
thing
as
a
merits
determination.
i
think
that's
the
point
that
stands
out
most
clearly
in
this
case,
that
there
was
nothing
more
that
the
board
could
have
done.
no
further
information
that
it
could've
considered
if
it
had
in
fact
reopened
the
classification.
now,
what
it
did
was
to
say,
“we
don't
think
he
is
a
conscientious
objector.”
now,
the
board
can
say
that
but
under
the
regulations,
this
constitutes
a
reopening
in
fact,
entitling
the
registrant
to
an
administrative
appeal
under
section
1625.13.
the
second
issue
and
this
isn't
a
way
related
to
the
first,
is
simply
that
he
was
denied
due
process
because
the
board
did
not
give
them
a
full
and
fair
hearing.
they
didn’t
read
the
file.
they,
at
best,
walked
through
it,
scanning
it
before
making
a
determination
that
he
didn’t
state
a
prima
facie
case.
they're
simply
would
not
have
been
timed
at
the
so-called
courtesy
hearing
for
the
three
members
who
were
present
to
even
scan,
let
alone
read
the
detailed
answers
to
sss
form
150,
let
alone
all
the
other
information
in
the
form.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
they
so
stated
at
the
trial,
there
were
three
--
there
were
three
members
present,
your
honor
at
the
november
9th
hearing.
mr.
sherman,
the
chairman
testified.
well,
we
looked
over
his
file
before
he
came
in
as
we
would
anyone
else.
now,
at
that
time,
in
the
record
and
the
civil
trial
will
bare
this
out.
there
were
other
registrants
ahead
of
mulloy.
then
mulloy
came
in
to
the
interview.
mr.
downs
said
that,
“the
file
was
there
and
any
member
who
wanted
to
could
look
at
it.”
i
asked
mr.
downs,
“did
you
read
it?”
he
said,
“no,
i
just
scanned
it
because
i
was
the
newest
member
of
the
board
and
i
wasn't
familiar
with
what
was
in
the
file
at
all.”
mr.
wolfgang
said
that,
“he
read
it
but
he
couldn't
recall
how
much
time
he
spent
on
it.”
i
think
it's
very
clear
from
the
evidence
that
these
members
didn't
read
the
file.
we've
also
contended
as
part
of
the
same
denial
of
the
full
and
fair
hearing
that
the
demonstrable
incompetence
of
the
draft
board
members
was
a
denial
of
due
process.
they
simply
did
not
understand
what
a
conscientious
objector
was.
the
clerk
testified
that
in
her
17
years
with
the
board,
no
one
had
ever
been
assigned
to
civilian
work
as
a
conscientious
objector.
mr.
sherman,
the
chairman
of
the
board
thought
that
a
conscientious
objector
was
one
who
was
opposed
to
the
use
of
violence
which
of
course
is
not
the
statutory
definition.
mr.
downs
didn't
seem
to
realize
that
the
board
had
the
power
to
determine
whether
a
man
was
a
conscientious
objector.
mr.
walking
seem
to
think
that
by
applying
for
conscientious
objector
status,
the
member
stay
--
the
registrant
stated
that
he
would
not
do
alternative
civilian
service.
now,
i
think
this
is
the
factual
situation
that
we
are
dealing
with.
the
government
says
that
the
board
must
have
assumed
that
the
petitioner
was
not
sincere.
otherwise,
it
would
have
been
inexplicable
that
they
didn't
reopen.
i
would
suggest
that
there
may
be
another
reason
that
they
never
read
the
file
and
if
they
had
read
the
file,
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
because
they
had
no
understanding
of
what
a
conscientious
objector
was.
the
relevant
time
period
is
a
fairly
brief
one.
all
the
relevant
events
relating
to
conscientious
objector
status
occurred
between
may
1967
and
january
1968.
the
petitioner
after
leaving
school
in
1966
went
to
work
for
the
appalachia
volunteers,
an
anti-poverty
group
working
in
eastern
kentucky.
he
was
given
an
occupational
deferment
to
weigh
from
march
1966
to
may
1967.
in
may
1967,
he
was
classified
as
i-a.
this
was
affirmed
by
the
appeals
board
in
august
of
1967.
i
believe
the
date
was
august
16th.
on
august
11,
1967,
petitioners
--
petitioner
and
two
other
people
were
arrested
in
eastern
kentucky
on
a
charge
of
teaching
sedition.
all
of
these
is
brought
out
in
mcsurely
versus
ratliff
we've
cited
in
the
brief
were
a
three
judge
federal
court
found
that
the
prosecution
was
undertaken
to
inhibit
organizing
activities
in
eastern
kentucky.
they
enjoined
the
prosecution
because
a
statute
was
patently
unconstitutional.
the
petitioner
spent
some
time
in
jail
before
he
was
released
on
bond.
there
was
a
midnight
raiding
party,
15
armed
men
led
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
came
to
the
petitioners
house
ransacked
through
all
the
books
and
records
and
this
was
the
sedition
prosecution
to
which
the
petitioner
was
subject.
the
three
judge
federal
court
enjoined
the
prosecution
on
september
14th,
1967.
it
then
directed
the
petitioner
and
the
other
plaintiffs
to
execute
a
$500.00
recognizance
bond
to
the
federal
court
pending
the
right
of
appeal.
the
states
right
of
appeal
expired
60
days
later
and
no
appeal
was
taken.
now,
the
petitioner
stated
in
his
letter
to
the
board
of
october
17th
that,
his
experiences
in
eastern
kentucky,
including
the
sedition
prosecution
were
the
precipitating
catalysts.
this
caused
generalized
belief
in
pacifism
and
nonviolence
and
he
demonstrated
his
belief
in
nonviolence
by
supporting
letters
to
crystallize
into
in
his
view,
objection
to
participation
in
war,
wrestled
with
his
conscience
and
came
to
the
conclusions
saying,
“i
can
now
say,
i
am
a
conscientious
objector.”
he
wrote
this
to
the
board.
he
filled
out
the
sss
form
150
in
great
detail.
included
in
the
letters
were
--
including
the
supporting
information
were
letters
from
a
catholic
priest
testifying
his
sincerity,
testifying
as
to
why
opposition
to
war
was
consistent
with
catholic
teaching.
there
were
further
letters
in
there
testifying
as
to
his
activities
in
eastern
kentucky.
the
board
members
granted
this
courtesy
hearing,
as
i
called
it,
on
november
9th,
right
after
the
board,
the
interview
which
lasted
about
10
or
15
minutes
and
here,
i
really
like
to
quote
from
the
government's
brief
that
they
meaning
the
board
members,
discussed
the
case
briefly
and
came
to
unanimous
conclusion
that
there
was
no
basis
or
justification
for
reopening
the
classification.
the
effective
decision
was
made
on
november
9th
but
an
entry
to
this
effect
was
made
on
form
100,
classification
not
reopened.
now,
the
reason
the
board
didn't
take
a
vote
that
evening,
was
that
petitioner
was
still
under
bond
to
the
federal
court
and
was
believed
under
indictment
in
kentucky
on
a
charge
of
flourishing
a
deadly
weapon
which
was
later
dropped.
they
took
the
formal
meeting,
the
formal
vote
at
a
meeting
of
january
11th
and
according
to
chairman
sherman
at
that
time,
it
readopted
or
reaffirmed
its
action
of
november
9th,
and
it's
that
point
where
we
held
the
entry
in
the
phase
form
100.
all
information
in
the
file
was
considered
including
claim
of
conscientious
objector.
all
members
present
felt
this
information
did
not
warrant
a
reopening
of
i-a
classification.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
he
had
an
occupational
deferment
until
may
of
1967.
this
then
was
not
renewed
and
this
was
denied
in
august
of
1967.
he
didn't
file
for
conscientious
objector
until
october
67
following
the
sedition
prosecution.
but,
he
made
it
very
clear
that
he
considered
his
work
in
appalachia
to
be
the
clearest
demonstration
of
his
religious
beliefs,
of
his
sincerity
and
his
opposition
to
war.
i
think
it's
also
fair
to
say
that
he
believed
that
if
he
were
granted
conscientious
objector
status,
he
might
be
permitted
to
continue
to
do
anti-poverty
work
which
would
presumably
qualify
as
alternative
service
in
the
national
interest
under
section
1660.1
of
the
regulations.
if
the
members
of
the
board
had
read
his
sss
form
150,
they
would
have
understood
the
correlation
between
his
work
in
appalachia
and
his
claim
of
conscientious
objector
status.
i
think
it's
the
height
of
sophistry
to
say
that
a
young
man,
not
learned
in
the
law,
who
by
law
can't
be
represented
by
counsel
before
these
draft
boards
can
suddenly
have
his
claim
for
conscientious
objector
status
converted
into
a
claim
for
occupational
deferment
which
had
previously
been
denied.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
yes
indeed,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
i
want
to
make
clear
your
honor
that
this
is
a
pre-induction
case,
that
there
was
no
outstanding
order
for
induction.
in
answer
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
pardon?
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
yes,
you're
honor.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
this,
i
think,
is
true
of
any
registrant
in
class
i-a.
i
think
if
you
say
that
this
is
late,
then
it
becomes
--
then
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
a
registrant
doesn't
claim
conscientious
objector
status
at
age
18-and-a-half
when
he
registers
for
the
draft,
it
can
always
be
found
that
he
is
late.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
it
wouldn't
have
--
i
think
i
have
two
answers
to
that,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place,
as
long
as
he
had
another
deferment,
the
board
could
not
consider
his
claim
for
conscientious
objector
status
under
the
regulations.
but
i
think
that
all
of
these
things
led
up.
i
focused
on
this
particular
event,
namely
the
sedition
prosecution.
its
when
does
a
man
really
have
to
face
up
to
the
question,
“am
i
a
conscientious
objector?”
there
is
a
recent
decision
that
came
down
from
the
fourth
circuit
involving
an
in-service
conscientious
objector
that
said
that
being
called
to
vietnam
maybe
the
catalytic
draft.
moreover,
there's
another
point
that
id
like
to
make
that
the
board
never
--
never
considered
this.
mr.
sherman,
the
chairman
of
the
board
was
specifically
asked,
“did
you
ask
him,
excuse
me,
any
questions
as
to
why
you
did
not
file
for
the
claim
of
conscientious
objector
earlier?”
mr.
sherman's
action
--
answer
was
“no,
none
that
i
recall.”
in
other
words,
presumably
a
board
could
find
that
the
man's
objection
to
war
meet
matured
at
an
earlier
time
and
conceivably,
though
the
court
might
suggest
to
the
contrary,
but
conceivably
under
1625.1
(b),
it
could
find
that
the
claim
was
not
timely
asserted.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
the
board
members
assumed
that
the
claim
was
timely
asserted.
they
stated
that
they
assumed
he
was
sincere
in
everything
that
he
said.
now,
the
government
is
trying
to
say,
“no,
they
didn't
really
mean
that.”
but
it
can't
point
to
one
place
in
the
record
where
any
board
member
affirmatively
stated,
“no,
we
didn't
believe
him.”
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
exactly,
you're
honor.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
that
is
the
--
that
is
what
i
called
the
first
issue.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
i
would
submit
your
honor
that
with
regard
to
pre-induction
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
i
think
you
stated
--
i
think
that's
--
i
think
it's
a
perfectly
correct
statement
of
the
first
issue.
i
would
say
that
with
regard
to
pre-induction
request
for
reopening,
every
circuit
but
sixth
has
held
that
the
board
is
required
to
reopen
when
the
registrant
presents
a
prima
facie
case.
that
is
when
the
new
facts,
if
true,
when
entitled
the
registrant
to
claim
classification,
the
board
must
reopen.
the
sixth
circuit
held
this
too
in
thompson
versus
zimmerman.
but
in
mulloy,
they
depart
from
thompson
versus
zimmerman.
the
sixth
circuit
is
the
only
circuit
that
upholds
that
the
board
is
not
required
to
reopen
whenever
a
prima
facie
case
for
classification
has
been
presented
and
they
held
this
in
the
case
of
the
most
difficult
claim
one
of
conscientious
objector.
what
they
have
done
has
been
to
completely
obliterate
mulloy
between
a
refusal
to
reopen
and
denial
of
claim
under
merits
following
a
reopening
that
what
were
they
were
saying
is
that
the
board
can
decide
if
it
wants
to
reopen
or
if
it
doesn't
want
to
reopen.
now,
this
is
totally
contrary
to
the
clear
import
of
the
regulation.
there
are
two
reasons
i
think
why
a
board
has
to
reopen
upon
the
presentment
of
a
prima
facie
case.
the
first
goes
to
procedural
due
process.
upon
a
reopening,
the
registrant
gets
a
personal
appearance.
that's
mandatory
under
section
625
--
1625.11
and
13.
it's
only
by
a
personal
appearance
that
he
will
get
a
chance
to
tell
his
side
of
the
story,
otherwise,
the
board
can't
simply
decide
without
having
heard
him
present
his
story.
the
second
reason
relates
to
an
appeal.
under
the
regulations
whenever
the
draft
board
decides
the
merits,
that
determination
is
to
be
reviewed
by
an
appeals
board.
if
the
draft
board
can
decide
the
merits
unilaterally
then
you
completely
negate
the
provisions
of
1625.13
providing
for
an
appeal
after
reopening.
now,
where
the
board
is
not
supposed
to
reopen
under
1625.4
is
where
the
new
facts
even
if
true
would
not
entitle
the
registrant
to
the
claim
classification.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
that
is
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
assuming
its
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
exactly,
and
you
know
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
it
wont
do
him
any
good
until
he
reach
26
because
under
1631.7
(a)
of
the
regulations,
if
his
number
come
up,
he
is
liable
and
he
is
called
notwithstanding
that
he
reaches
26.
so,
that
won't
do
him
any
good.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
there
are
only
a
limited
number
of
classifications
but
if
i
may
suggest,
i
was
going
to
answer
your
honors
question,
“no,
because
i
don't
want
to
get
into
a
box
of
advocating
something
ridiculous.”
let
me
draw
an
analogy
to
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
i
read
1625.1,
2,
and
4
as
in
effect
embodying
dismissal
of
a
claim
on
--
sorry,
dismissal
of
a
complaint
on
the
ground
that
it
fails
to
state
a
claim
on
which
relief
can
be
granted.
there,
we
do
not
look
beyond
the
facts
of
the
claim.
assuming
that
the
facts
if
true,
would
not
entitle
the
registrant
to
the
claim
classification,
the
board
has
justified
in
dismissing.
but
if
the
facts,
if
true,
would
entitle
him
to
the
claim
classification,
the
board
must
reopen
unless
there
is
no
genuine
issue
of
material
fact.
in
other
words,
i
would
use
the
same
thing
as
in
the
summary
judgment
case.
suppose
the
registrant
asks
for
a
reopening
on
the
ground
that
he
is
a
regularly
enrolled
student
in
cudham
college
as
of
january
1.
on
january
2nd,
there
is
received
in
his
file
a
letter
from
the
registrar
of
cudham
college
saying
that
as
of
january
2nd,
he
was
dismissed.
assuming
the
board
verifies
this,
calls
the
registrant
in,
lets
him
verify
this,
i
would
say,
“no.
they
are
not
required
to
reopen
and
there's
no
reopening
in
fact.”
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
where
the
new
facts,
if
true,
would
entitle
the
registrant
to
the
claimed
classification
and
it
cannot
be
said
that
there
is
no
genuine
issue
as
to
any
material
fact.
this
would
require
a
reopening
and
i
think
your
honor
that
that
would
answer
your
question
as
to
the
member
of
the
senate.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
i
believe
that
it
is
provided
that
all,
there
are
severe
penalties
for
making
false
statements
to
the
board.
that
should
serve
as
a
sufficient
deterrent.
i
really
don't
think
that
this
is
a
practical
problem.
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained
anymore
by
a
registrant
delaying
this.
it
won't
prevent
his
induction.
moreover,
the
board
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
i
believe
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
true,
the
board
held
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
but
the
board
couldn't
provide.
this
provided
him
the
statute
that
any
false
statements
to
the
board
subject
a
person
to
five
years
imprisonment
and
a
fine
of
$10,000.00,
so
that,
that
should
be
sufficient
deterrent
against
making
false
statements.
i
believe
i
will
reserve
the
time
for
rebuttal,
so
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
you're
honor.
to
get
back
to
the
first
point
that
i
made,
the
issue
before
this
court
is
not
whether
petitioner
mulloy
is
a
conscientious
objector
or
whether
there
is
a
basis
in
fact
for
a
board's
merit
decision
followed
by
an
appeal
that
a
man
was
not
a
conscientious
objector.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
was
the
board
required
to
reopen
and
give
the
man
an
appeal.
that's
all
we
were
asking
in
this
case,
is
to
have
an
appeal.
the
government
has
gone
through
the
file
pointing
out
that
the
board
could've
found
this
and
the
board
could've
found
that.
for
purposes
of
argument,
let's
assume
that
the
board
could've
done
this.
under
the
regulations,
this
decision
is
also
to
be
made
by
an
appeals
board.
in
this
case,
it
is
the
petitioner
who
was
arguing
for
adherence
to
the
regulations.
and
it's
the
government
that
is
arguing
for
a
broad
interpretation
of
the
regulations
for
which
it
confined
no
support.
the
clear
scheme
of
the
regulations
is
that
merits
determinations
are
to
be
reviewed
where
a
man
makes
out
a
prima
facie
case
or
a
new
classification
--
(inaudible)
a
claim
that
had
never
been
made
before.
when
a
man
makes
out
a
prima
facie
case
for
a
new
classification,
assuming
that
there
is
an
issue
of
material
fact,
and
certainly
the
government's
argument
makes
it
clear
that
there
was
such
an
issue.
then
the
procedure
provided
in
the
regulations
is
for
the
board
to
reopen.
make
a
decision,
then
give
the
man
a
personal
appearance,
so
that
he
can
fully
tell
his
side
of
the
story,
present
his
version,
try
to
correct
the
board.
then,
if
the
board
still
keeps
him
in
that
classification,
the
case
is
reviewed
de
novo
by
the
appeals
board.
so,
that's
all
we're
talking
about
here.
should
there
have
been
an
appeal.
the
consequences
that
the
government
talks
about
are
imaginary
and
all
of
the
other
circuits;
the
boards
have
been
required
to
reopen
whenever
a
prima
facie
case
has
been
presented.
the
draft
hasn't
stopped
functioning.
all
that
it
is
meant
is
that
people
will
get
a
fair
chance.
the
present
petitioner
is
under
a
sentence
of
five
years
imprisonment
and
a
fine
of
$10,000.00
following
a
determination
that
is
basically
made
for
10
minutes
and
i
repeat
your
honors,
they
never
read
the
record.
it
seems
to
me
and
maybe
i
have
an
advantage
here
over
the
government's
counsel
because
i've
tried
the
case
from
the
beginning
that
we're
in
never,
never
land.
the
government
has
attributed
these
highly
sophisticated
mental
processes
to
the
board
but
the
board
never
read
the
file.
they
never
carefully
went
through
the
sss
form
150.
it
may
well
have
been
that
on
the
basis
of
what
they
heard
at
the
interview,
they
thought
he
was
asking
for
an
occupational
deferment.
they
couldn't
have
reached
that
conclusion,
if
they
would've
read
his
sss
form
150
and
they
would've
seen
as
your
honors
pointed
out
from
the
bench,
the
correlation
between
his
views.
now,
we're
talking
about
a
young
man,
this
time
23
years
old
who
wasn't
represented
by
counsel.
maybe
if
lawyers
were
allowed
to
appear
before
draft
boards,
we
could
clear
some
of
these
things
up.
if
the
board
members
had
these
doubts,
why
didn't
the
board
member
asked
him?
now,
mr.
mulloy,
let's
be
clear,
what
are
you
claiming?
are
you
claiming
classification
as
a
conscientious
objector
or
do
you
want
an
occupational
deferment?
nobody
asked
him
that.
nobody
asked
any
questions
at
all.
he
was
entitled
to
assume
that
they
read
the
record,
which
they
didn't.
we're
told
that
we're
supposed
to
presume
that
these
proceedings
are
fair
and
regular.
i
would
submit
with
all
due
deference,
you
can't
presume
that
on
the
record
that
we
have
here
because
the
board
members
simply
did
not
read
the
file.
now,
we're
talking
about
the
most
difficult
classification
here
that
of
conscientious
objector.
the
board
members
throughout
assumed
the
sincerity
of
the
petitioner.
they
assumed
that
he
was
sincere
in
his
beliefs.
those
beliefs
are
essentially
religious
beliefs.
this
is
clear
from
a
reading
of
the
form
150.
it's
clear
from
the
letter
from
the
catholic
priest.
it's
clear
from
the
other
evidence
from
the
file.
i
would
submit
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
file
at
all,
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
claim
of
conscientious
objector
status.
so
that
what
the
issue
comes
down
to
on
the
procedural
questions
is
when
does
a
draft
board
have
to
reopen?
we
would
submit
that
the
board
must
reopen
whenever
a
pre-induction
claim
is
made
for
a
new
classification.
i
believe
my
time
has
expired
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court?
the
issues
in
this
case,
arise
out
of
the
stated
refusal
of
petitioner
mulloys
selective
service
board
to
reopen
his
classification
and
consider
his
claim
for
conscientious
objector
status.
that's
what
we
are
dealing
with
here,
a
failure
to
reopen.
we
do
not
have
the
case
where
the
board
has
decided
to
claim,
at
least
officially,
on
the
merits
and
where
there
has
been
an
appeal,
or
at
least,
an
opportunity
for
an
appeal,
so
that
the
question
before
this
court
would
be
whether
there
was
a
basis
in
fact
for
the
determination.
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
petitioner
was
a
conscientious
objector
or
whether
there
was
a
basis
in
fact
for
a
substantive
determination
that
he
was
not.
the
issue
is
purely
a
procedural
one.
did
the
petitioner
make
enough
of
a
showing
of
entitlement
to
classification
as
a
conscientious
objector
that
he
was
entitled
to
an
appealable
determination
by
the
board?
i
guess
what
this
case
is
all
about
is
that
the
petitioner
claims,
he
was
entitled
to
a
full-scale
determination
including
the
right
of
appeal.
the
board
summarily
dismissed.
the
first
issue
then
revolves
around
the
summary
dismissal.
the
petitioner
is
contended
throughout
these
proceedings
that
the
board
either
was
required
to
reopen
because
based
on
his
sss
form
150
and
the
letters
and
other
information
submitted
in
support
of
a
claim,
he
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
entitlement
or,
that
what
really
happened
was
that
the
board
in
fact
reopened
deciding
the
claim
against
him
on
the
merits
but
denying
him
the
appeal
to
which
he
was
entitled
by
the
regulations.
in
this
court,
the
government
now
concedes
which
is
a
clear
departure
from
its
position
here
before
that
based
on
the
sss
form
150
and
the
supporting
letters,
the
petitioner
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
entitlement
but
says
the
government,
even
so,
the
board
does
not
have
to
reopen.
i
think
issue
was
joined
on
that
first
point.
the
second
issue
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
no,
your
honor.
this
is
a
point
that
we
have
made
and
that
the
board
did
not
say
why
it
found
that
he
wasn't
a
conscientious
objector.b
ut
the
record
does
clearly
say
what
the
board
did.
the
form
100,
the
phase
form,
falling
the
november
9th
meeting,
says,
“classification
not
reopened”.
now,
following
the
meeting
on
january
11th,
the
sss
form
100
reads
all
information
in
the
file
considered
including
claim
of
conscientious
objector.
the
board
felt
that
information
did
not
warrant
reopening
of
1-a
classification
vote
four
to
nothing.
this
was
also
brought
out
at
the
testimony
both
in
the
civil
trial
and
the
criminal
trial
where
chairman
sherman
stated,
“that
taking
everything
in
the
file.”
assuming
what
he
said
to
be
true,
he
did
not
make
out
a
case
and
we
saw
no
reason
to
reopen
because
it
wasn't
there.
i
think
it
is
very
clear
that
the
board's
reason
for
its
action
was
that
the
petitioner
did
not
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
for
entitlement.
this
was
the
government's
argument
both
in
the
district
court
and
before
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
explicitly
stated
that,
petitioner
did
not
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
and
therefore
the
board
was
not
required
to
reopen.
now,
we
have
contended
all
along,
that
the
only
way
you
could
say,
he
did
not
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
is
to
totally
distort
the
meaning
of
prima
facie
case,
and
say
that
prima
facie
case
means
the
same
thing
as
a
merits
determination.
i
think
that's
the
point
that
stands
out
most
clearly
in
this
case,
that
there
was
nothing
more
that
the
board
could
have
done.
no
further
information
that
it
could've
considered
if
it
had
in
fact
reopened
the
classification.
now,
what
it
did
was
to
say,
“we
don't
think
he
is
a
conscientious
objector.”
now,
the
board
can
say
that
but
under
the
regulations,
this
constitutes
a
reopening
in
fact,
entitling
the
registrant
to
an
administrative
appeal
under
section
1625.13.
the
second
issue
and
this
isn't
a
way
related
to
the
first,
is
simply
that
he
was
denied
due
process
because
the
board
did
not
give
them
a
full
and
fair
hearing.
they
didn’t
read
the
file.
they,
at
best,
walked
through
it,
scanning
it
before
making
a
determination
that
he
didn’t
state
a
prima
facie
case.
they're
simply
would
not
have
been
timed
at
the
so-called
courtesy
hearing
for
the
three
members
who
were
present
to
even
scan,
let
alone
read
the
detailed
answers
to
sss
form
150,
let
alone
all
the
other
information
in
the
form.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
they
so
stated
at
the
trial,
there
were
three
--
there
were
three
members
present,
your
honor
at
the
november
9th
hearing.
mr.
sherman,
the
chairman
testified.
well,
we
looked
over
his
file
before
he
came
in
as
we
would
anyone
else.
now,
at
that
time,
in
the
record
and
the
civil
trial
will
bare
this
out.
there
were
other
registrants
ahead
of
mulloy.
then
mulloy
came
in
to
the
interview.
mr.
downs
said
that,
“the
file
was
there
and
any
member
who
wanted
to
could
look
at
it.”
i
asked
mr.
downs,
“did
you
read
it?”
he
said,
“no,
i
just
scanned
it
because
i
was
the
newest
member
of
the
board
and
i
wasn't
familiar
with
what
was
in
the
file
at
all.”
mr.
wolfgang
said
that,
“he
read
it
but
he
couldn't
recall
how
much
time
he
spent
on
it.”
i
think
it's
very
clear
from
the
evidence
that
these
members
didn't
read
the
file.
we've
also
contended
as
part
of
the
same
denial
of
the
full
and
fair
hearing
that
the
demonstrable
incompetence
of
the
draft
board
members
was
a
denial
of
due
process.
they
simply
did
not
understand
what
a
conscientious
objector
was.
the
clerk
testified
that
in
her
17
years
with
the
board,
no
one
had
ever
been
assigned
to
civilian
work
as
a
conscientious
objector.
mr.
sherman,
the
chairman
of
the
board
thought
that
a
conscientious
objector
was
one
who
was
opposed
to
the
use
of
violence
which
of
course
is
not
the
statutory
definition.
mr.
downs
didn't
seem
to
realize
that
the
board
had
the
power
to
determine
whether
a
man
was
a
conscientious
objector.
mr.
walking
seem
to
think
that
by
applying
for
conscientious
objector
status,
the
member
stay
--
the
registrant
stated
that
he
would
not
do
alternative
civilian
service.
now,
i
think
this
is
the
factual
situation
that
we
are
dealing
with.
the
government
says
that
the
board
must
have
assumed
that
the
petitioner
was
not
sincere.
otherwise,
it
would
have
been
inexplicable
that
they
didn't
reopen.
i
would
suggest
that
there
may
be
another
reason
that
they
never
read
the
file
and
if
they
had
read
the
file,
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
because
they
had
no
understanding
of
what
a
conscientious
objector
was.
the
relevant
time
period
is
a
fairly
brief
one.
all
the
relevant
events
relating
to
conscientious
objector
status
occurred
between
may
1967
and
january
1968.
the
petitioner
after
leaving
school
in
1966
went
to
work
for
the
appalachia
volunteers,
an
anti-poverty
group
working
in
eastern
kentucky.
he
was
given
an
occupational
deferment
to
weigh
from
march
1966
to
may
1967.
in
may
1967,
he
was
classified
as
i-a.
this
was
affirmed
by
the
appeals
board
in
august
of
1967.
i
believe
the
date
was
august
16th.
on
august
11,
1967,
petitioners
--
petitioner
and
two
other
people
were
arrested
in
eastern
kentucky
on
a
charge
of
teaching
sedition.
all
of
these
is
brought
out
in
mcsurely
versus
ratliff
we've
cited
in
the
brief
were
a
three
judge
federal
court
found
that
the
prosecution
was
undertaken
to
inhibit
organizing
activities
in
eastern
kentucky.
they
enjoined
the
prosecution
because
a
statute
was
patently
unconstitutional.
the
petitioner
spent
some
time
in
jail
before
he
was
released
on
bond.
there
was
a
midnight
raiding
party,
15
armed
men
led
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
came
to
the
petitioners
house
ransacked
through
all
the
books
and
records
and
this
was
the
sedition
prosecution
to
which
the
petitioner
was
subject.
the
three
judge
federal
court
enjoined
the
prosecution
on
september
14th,
1967.
it
then
directed
the
petitioner
and
the
other
plaintiffs
to
execute
a
$500.00
recognizance
bond
to
the
federal
court
pending
the
right
of
appeal.
the
states
right
of
appeal
expired
60
days
later
and
no
appeal
was
taken.
now,
the
petitioner
stated
in
his
letter
to
the
board
of
october
17th
that,
his
experiences
in
eastern
kentucky,
including
the
sedition
prosecution
were
the
precipitating
catalysts.
this
caused
generalized
belief
in
pacifism
and
nonviolence
and
he
demonstrated
his
belief
in
nonviolence
by
supporting
letters
to
crystallize
into
in
his
view,
objection
to
participation
in
war,
wrestled
with
his
conscience
and
came
to
the
conclusions
saying,
“i
can
now
say,
i
am
a
conscientious
objector.”
he
wrote
this
to
the
board.
he
filled
out
the
sss
form
150
in
great
detail.
included
in
the
letters
were
--
including
the
supporting
information
were
letters
from
a
catholic
priest
testifying
his
sincerity,
testifying
as
to
why
opposition
to
war
was
consistent
with
catholic
teaching.
there
were
further
letters
in
there
testifying
as
to
his
activities
in
eastern
kentucky.
the
board
members
granted
this
courtesy
hearing,
as
i
called
it,
on
november
9th,
right
after
the
board,
the
interview
which
lasted
about
10
or
15
minutes
and
here,
i
really
like
to
quote
from
the
government's
brief
that
they
meaning
the
board
members,
discussed
the
case
briefly
and
came
to
unanimous
conclusion
that
there
was
no
basis
or
justification
for
reopening
the
classification.
the
effective
decision
was
made
on
november
9th
but
an
entry
to
this
effect
was
made
on
form
100,
classification
not
reopened.
now,
the
reason
the
board
didn't
take
a
vote
that
evening,
was
that
petitioner
was
still
under
bond
to
the
federal
court
and
was
believed
under
indictment
in
kentucky
on
a
charge
of
flourishing
a
deadly
weapon
which
was
later
dropped.
they
took
the
formal
meeting,
the
formal
vote
at
a
meeting
of
january
11th
and
according
to
chairman
sherman
at
that
time,
it
readopted
or
reaffirmed
its
action
of
november
9th,
and
it's
that
point
where
we
held
the
entry
in
the
phase
form
100.
all
information
in
the
file
was
considered
including
claim
of
conscientious
objector.
all
members
present
felt
this
information
did
not
warrant
a
reopening
of
i-a
classification.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
he
had
an
occupational
deferment
until
may
of
1967.
this
then
was
not
renewed
and
this
was
denied
in
august
of
1967.
he
didn't
file
for
conscientious
objector
until
october
67
following
the
sedition
prosecution.
but,
he
made
it
very
clear
that
he
considered
his
work
in
appalachia
to
be
the
clearest
demonstration
of
his
religious
beliefs,
of
his
sincerity
and
his
opposition
to
war.
i
think
it's
also
fair
to
say
that
he
believed
that
if
he
were
granted
conscientious
objector
status,
he
might
be
permitted
to
continue
to
do
anti-poverty
work
which
would
presumably
qualify
as
alternative
service
in
the
national
interest
under
section
1660.1
of
the
regulations.
if
the
members
of
the
board
had
read
his
sss
form
150,
they
would
have
understood
the
correlation
between
his
work
in
appalachia
and
his
claim
of
conscientious
objector
status.
i
think
it's
the
height
of
sophistry
to
say
that
a
young
man,
not
learned
in
the
law,
who
by
law
can't
be
represented
by
counsel
before
these
draft
boards
can
suddenly
have
his
claim
for
conscientious
objector
status
converted
into
a
claim
for
occupational
deferment
which
had
previously
been
denied.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
yes
indeed,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
i
want
to
make
clear
your
honor
that
this
is
a
pre-induction
case,
that
there
was
no
outstanding
order
for
induction.
in
answer
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
pardon?
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
yes,
you're
honor.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
this,
i
think,
is
true
of
any
registrant
in
class
i-a.
i
think
if
you
say
that
this
is
late,
then
it
becomes
--
then
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
a
registrant
doesn't
claim
conscientious
objector
status
at
age
18-and-a-half
when
he
registers
for
the
draft,
it
can
always
be
found
that
he
is
late.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
it
wouldn't
have
--
i
think
i
have
two
answers
to
that,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place,
as
long
as
he
had
another
deferment,
the
board
could
not
consider
his
claim
for
conscientious
objector
status
under
the
regulations.
but
i
think
that
all
of
these
things
led
up.
i
focused
on
this
particular
event,
namely
the
sedition
prosecution.
its
when
does
a
man
really
have
to
face
up
to
the
question,
“am
i
a
conscientious
objector?”
there
is
a
recent
decision
that
came
down
from
the
fourth
circuit
involving
an
in-service
conscientious
objector
that
said
that
being
called
to
vietnam
maybe
the
catalytic
draft.
moreover,
there's
another
point
that
id
like
to
make
that
the
board
never
--
never
considered
this.
mr.
sherman,
the
chairman
of
the
board
was
specifically
asked,
“did
you
ask
him,
excuse
me,
any
questions
as
to
why
you
did
not
file
for
the
claim
of
conscientious
objector
earlier?”
mr.
sherman's
action
--
answer
was
“no,
none
that
i
recall.”
in
other
words,
presumably
a
board
could
find
that
the
man's
objection
to
war
meet
matured
at
an
earlier
time
and
conceivably,
though
the
court
might
suggest
to
the
contrary,
but
conceivably
under
1625.1
(b),
it
could
find
that
the
claim
was
not
timely
asserted.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
the
board
members
assumed
that
the
claim
was
timely
asserted.
they
stated
that
they
assumed
he
was
sincere
in
everything
that
he
said.
now,
the
government
is
trying
to
say,
“no,
they
didn't
really
mean
that.”
but
it
can't
point
to
one
place
in
the
record
where
any
board
member
affirmatively
stated,
“no,
we
didn't
believe
him.”
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
exactly,
you're
honor.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
that
is
the
--
that
is
what
i
called
the
first
issue.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
i
would
submit
your
honor
that
with
regard
to
pre-induction
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
i
think
you
stated
--
i
think
that's
--
i
think
it's
a
perfectly
correct
statement
of
the
first
issue.
i
would
say
that
with
regard
to
pre-induction
request
for
reopening,
every
circuit
but
sixth
has
held
that
the
board
is
required
to
reopen
when
the
registrant
presents
a
prima
facie
case.
that
is
when
the
new
facts,
if
true,
when
entitled
the
registrant
to
claim
classification,
the
board
must
reopen.
the
sixth
circuit
held
this
too
in
thompson
versus
zimmerman.
but
in
mulloy,
they
depart
from
thompson
versus
zimmerman.
the
sixth
circuit
is
the
only
circuit
that
upholds
that
the
board
is
not
required
to
reopen
whenever
a
prima
facie
case
for
classification
has
been
presented
and
they
held
this
in
the
case
of
the
most
difficult
claim
one
of
conscientious
objector.
what
they
have
done
has
been
to
completely
obliterate
mulloy
between
a
refusal
to
reopen
and
denial
of
claim
under
merits
following
a
reopening
that
what
were
they
were
saying
is
that
the
board
can
decide
if
it
wants
to
reopen
or
if
it
doesn't
want
to
reopen.
now,
this
is
totally
contrary
to
the
clear
import
of
the
regulation.
there
are
two
reasons
i
think
why
a
board
has
to
reopen
upon
the
presentment
of
a
prima
facie
case.
the
first
goes
to
procedural
due
process.
upon
a
reopening,
the
registrant
gets
a
personal
appearance.
that's
mandatory
under
section
625
--
1625.11
and
13.
it's
only
by
a
personal
appearance
that
he
will
get
a
chance
to
tell
his
side
of
the
story,
otherwise,
the
board
can't
simply
decide
without
having
heard
him
present
his
story.
the
second
reason
relates
to
an
appeal.
under
the
regulations
whenever
the
draft
board
decides
the
merits,
that
determination
is
to
be
reviewed
by
an
appeals
board.
if
the
draft
board
can
decide
the
merits
unilaterally
then
you
completely
negate
the
provisions
of
1625.13
providing
for
an
appeal
after
reopening.
now,
where
the
board
is
not
supposed
to
reopen
under
1625.4
is
where
the
new
facts
even
if
true
would
not
entitle
the
registrant
to
the
claim
classification.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
that
is
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
assuming
its
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
exactly,
and
you
know
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
it
wont
do
him
any
good
until
he
reach
26
because
under
1631.7
(a)
of
the
regulations,
if
his
number
come
up,
he
is
liable
and
he
is
called
notwithstanding
that
he
reaches
26.
so,
that
won't
do
him
any
good.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
there
are
only
a
limited
number
of
classifications
but
if
i
may
suggest,
i
was
going
to
answer
your
honors
question,
“no,
because
i
don't
want
to
get
into
a
box
of
advocating
something
ridiculous.”
let
me
draw
an
analogy
to
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
i
read
1625.1,
2,
and
4
as
in
effect
embodying
dismissal
of
a
claim
on
--
sorry,
dismissal
of
a
complaint
on
the
ground
that
it
fails
to
state
a
claim
on
which
relief
can
be
granted.
there,
we
do
not
look
beyond
the
facts
of
the
claim.
assuming
that
the
facts
if
true,
would
not
entitle
the
registrant
to
the
claim
classification,
the
board
has
justified
in
dismissing.
but
if
the
facts,
if
true,
would
entitle
him
to
the
claim
classification,
the
board
must
reopen
unless
there
is
no
genuine
issue
of
material
fact.
in
other
words,
i
would
use
the
same
thing
as
in
the
summary
judgment
case.
suppose
the
registrant
asks
for
a
reopening
on
the
ground
that
he
is
a
regularly
enrolled
student
in
cudham
college
as
of
january
1.
on
january
2nd,
there
is
received
in
his
file
a
letter
from
the
registrar
of
cudham
college
saying
that
as
of
january
2nd,
he
was
dismissed.
assuming
the
board
verifies
this,
calls
the
registrant
in,
lets
him
verify
this,
i
would
say,
“no.
they
are
not
required
to
reopen
and
there's
no
reopening
in
fact.”
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
where
the
new
facts,
if
true,
would
entitle
the
registrant
to
the
claimed
classification
and
it
cannot
be
said
that
there
is
no
genuine
issue
as
to
any
material
fact.
this
would
require
a
reopening
and
i
think
your
honor
that
that
would
answer
your
question
as
to
the
member
of
the
senate.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
i
believe
that
it
is
provided
that
all,
there
are
severe
penalties
for
making
false
statements
to
the
board.
that
should
serve
as
a
sufficient
deterrent.
i
really
don't
think
that
this
is
a
practical
problem.
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained
anymore
by
a
registrant
delaying
this.
it
won't
prevent
his
induction.
moreover,
the
board
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
i
believe
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
true,
the
board
held
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
but
the
board
couldn't
provide.
this
provided
him
the
statute
that
any
false
statements
to
the
board
subject
a
person
to
five
years
imprisonment
and
a
fine
of
$10,000.00,
so
that,
that
should
be
sufficient
deterrent
against
making
false
statements.
i
believe
i
will
reserve
the
time
for
rebuttal,
so
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
you're
honor.
to
get
back
to
the
first
point
that
i
made,
the
issue
before
this
court
is
not
whether
petitioner
mulloy
is
a
conscientious
objector
or
whether
there
is
a
basis
in
fact
for
a
board's
merit
decision
followed
by
an
appeal
that
a
man
was
not
a
conscientious
objector.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
was
the
board
required
to
reopen
and
give
the
man
an
appeal.
that's
all
we
were
asking
in
this
case,
is
to
have
an
appeal.
the
government
has
gone
through
the
file
pointing
out
that
the
board
could've
found
this
and
the
board
could've
found
that.
for
purposes
of
argument,
let's
assume
that
the
board
could've
done
this.
under
the
regulations,
this
decision
is
also
to
be
made
by
an
appeals
board.
in
this
case,
it
is
the
petitioner
who
was
arguing
for
adherence
to
the
regulations.
and
it's
the
government
that
is
arguing
for
a
broad
interpretation
of
the
regulations
for
which
it
confined
no
support.
the
clear
scheme
of
the
regulations
is
that
merits
determinations
are
to
be
reviewed
where
a
man
makes
out
a
prima
facie
case
or
a
new
classification
--
(inaudible)
a
claim
that
had
never
been
made
before.
when
a
man
makes
out
a
prima
facie
case
for
a
new
classification,
assuming
that
there
is
an
issue
of
material
fact,
and
certainly
the
government's
argument
makes
it
clear
that
there
was
such
an
issue.
then
the
procedure
provided
in
the
regulations
is
for
the
board
to
reopen.
make
a
decision,
then
give
the
man
a
personal
appearance,
so
that
he
can
fully
tell
his
side
of
the
story,
present
his
version,
try
to
correct
the
board.
then,
if
the
board
still
keeps
him
in
that
classification,
the
case
is
reviewed
de
novo
by
the
appeals
board.
so,
that's
all
we're
talking
about
here.
should
there
have
been
an
appeal.
the
consequences
that
the
government
talks
about
are
imaginary
and
all
of
the
other
circuits;
the
boards
have
been
required
to
reopen
whenever
a
prima
facie
case
has
been
presented.
the
draft
hasn't
stopped
functioning.
all
that
it
is
meant
is
that
people
will
get
a
fair
chance.
the
present
petitioner
is
under
a
sentence
of
five
years
imprisonment
and
a
fine
of
$10,000.00
following
a
determination
that
is
basically
made
for
10
minutes
and
i
repeat
your
honors,
they
never
read
the
record.
it
seems
to
me
and
maybe
i
have
an
advantage
here
over
the
government's
counsel
because
i've
tried
the
case
from
the
beginning
that
we're
in
never,
never
land.
the
government
has
attributed
these
highly
sophisticated
mental
processes
to
the
board
but
the
board
never
read
the
file.
they
never
carefully
went
through
the
sss
form
150.
it
may
well
have
been
that
on
the
basis
of
what
they
heard
at
the
interview,
they
thought
he
was
asking
for
an
occupational
deferment.
they
couldn't
have
reached
that
conclusion,
if
they
would've
read
his
sss
form
150
and
they
would've
seen
as
your
honors
pointed
out
from
the
bench,
the
correlation
between
his
views.
now,
we're
talking
about
a
young
man,
this
time
23
years
old
who
wasn't
represented
by
counsel.
maybe
if
lawyers
were
allowed
to
appear
before
draft
boards,
we
could
clear
some
of
these
things
up.
if
the
board
members
had
these
doubts,
why
didn't
the
board
member
asked
him?
now,
mr.
mulloy,
let's
be
clear,
what
are
you
claiming?
are
you
claiming
classification
as
a
conscientious
objector
or
do
you
want
an
occupational
deferment?
nobody
asked
him
that.
nobody
asked
any
questions
at
all.
he
was
entitled
to
assume
that
they
read
the
record,
which
they
didn't.
we're
told
that
we're
supposed
to
presume
that
these
proceedings
are
fair
and
regular.
i
would
submit
with
all
due
deference,
you
can't
presume
that
on
the
record
that
we
have
here
because
the
board
members
simply
did
not
read
the
file.
now,
we're
talking
about
the
most
difficult
classification
here
that
of
conscientious
objector.
the
board
members
throughout
assumed
the
sincerity
of
the
petitioner.
they
assumed
that
he
was
sincere
in
his
beliefs.
those
beliefs
are
essentially
religious
beliefs.
this
is
clear
from
a
reading
of
the
form
150.
it's
clear
from
the
letter
from
the
catholic
priest.
it's
clear
from
the
other
evidence
from
the
file.
i
would
submit
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
file
at
all,
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
claim
of
conscientious
objector
status.
so
that
what
the
issue
comes
down
to
on
the
procedural
questions
is
when
does
a
draft
board
have
to
reopen?
we
would
submit
that
the
board
must
reopen
whenever
a
pre-induction
claim
is
made
for
a
new
classification.
i
believe
my
time
has
expired
your
honor.
thank
you.
