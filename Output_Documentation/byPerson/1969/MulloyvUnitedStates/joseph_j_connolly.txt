mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
since
mr.
sedler
has
taxed
the
government
for
changing
its
position
during
this
litigation.
it
seems
appropriate
for
me
to
restate
the
government's
position
at
the
outset
of
my
argument.
i
think
i
can
do
so
in
two
propositions
which
i
will
briefly
describe
and
then
return
to
each
in
more
detail.
the
first
proposition
relates
to
what
we
believe
to
be
the
basic
issue
of
law
in
this
case.
that
is,
what
inquiries
can
a
local
board
make
and
what
issues
can
it
resolved
concerning
a
request
for
reclassification
without
the
board
being
deemed
to
have,
in
fact,
reopen
the
classification.
section
1625.4
of
the
regulations
clearly
specifies
two
issues
which
are
for
the
primary
determination
by
the
board
in
deciding
whether
to
reopen.
the
first
is
whether
the
facts
alleged
by
the
registrant,
if
true,
would
justify
a
change
in
the
registrant's
classification.
the
second
issue
is
whether
the
facts
presented
are
new
facts
which
were
not
considered
by
the
board
at
the
time
the
registrant
was
classified.
the
discretionary
language
of
1625.2
also
demonstrates
that
there
are
other
issues
which
may
be
resolved
by
the
board
without
a
reopening.
thus,
we
believe
that
the
board
may
in
certain
circumstances
decide
the
critical
facts
are
not
true
and
therefore,
the
reclassification
would
not
be
justified.
the
board
also
may
reach
certain
conclusions
about
the
facts
alleged
and
deny
reopening
on
that
basis,
thus,
in
certainly
--
certain
narrowly
defined
classes
of
cases
which
i
will
illustrate
presently.
the
board
may
conclude
that
the
registrant's
civilian
work
is
not
in
the
national
interest
or
that
its
claim
of
conscientious
objection
is
not
a
sincerely
held
belief.
interpreted
in
this
manner,
we
believe
that
the
regulation
affords
a
necessary
flexibility
to
the
selective
service
system
to
dispose
off
meritless
applications
without
full
administrative
procedures.
this
is
necessary
as
we
show
in
our
brief
in
order
to
prevent
the
administrative
system
from
becoming
bogged
down
with
such
applications
and
to
prevent
disingenuous
registrants
from
postponing
and
perhaps
avoiding
military
service.
our
second
proposition
relates
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
we
submit
that
what
the
local
board
did
in
this
case
was
to
conclude
that
petitioner
had
not
set
forth
facts
which
would
justify
conscientious
objector
classification.
because
the
true
premise
for
his
claim
was
his
belief
in
the
importance
of
his
work
in
appalachia.
this
is
the
determination
which
the
board
has
clearly
authorized
to
make.
and
as
i
hope
to
demonstrate
later
in
this
argument,
the
board
had
a
rational
basis
when
the
facts
of
this
case
for
making
that
determination.
and
mr.
sedler
has
stated
that
the
government
has
conceded
that
there
was
a
prima
facie
basis
--
prima
facie
case
for
reclassification.
the
government
has
made
this
concession
and
i
should
clarify
our
position.
we
believe
that
certain
of
the
facts
set
forth
in
petitioners
form
150
and
in
the
accompanying
letters,
taken
together
with
all
doubts
resolved
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
and
with
all
inconsistent
information
disregarded
would
have
constituted
a
prima
facie
case.
but
the
question
for
the
local
board
was
whether
it
should
try
to
piece
together
the
favorable
information,
resolve
doubts
in
favor
of
the
petitioner,
and
disregard
his
own
statements
that
seemed
inconsistent
with
his
claim.
that
was
the
question
which
the
board
resolved
after
its
courtesy
interview
with
the
petitioner.
it
decided
that
there
was
no
reason
to
reopen
because
the
facts
as
explained
by
the
petitioner
did
not
justify
reclassification.
now
as
to
the
point
of
law
involved
in
this
case,
i
would
like
to
give
three
illustrations
of
what
i
think
would
be
the
government's
position
as
to
what
inquiries
the
board
can
make
without
reopening
and
what
issues
it
can
resolve
without
reopening.
i
think
the
first
illustration
was
elicited
in
mr.
sedlers
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
stewart
concerning
the
question,
whether
the
registrant
is
a
student
at
x
college,
whether
he
is
a
united
states
senator
or
perhaps
whether
his
wife
is
pregnant
as
he
alleges.
we
believe
that
the
discretion
granted
to
the
board
in
section
1625.2
allows
the
board
to
inquire
into
that
critical
fact,
if
true
and
if
the
fact
is
found
not
true,
then
to
deny
a
reopening
on
that
basis.
the
second
illustration
that
i
would
give
is
a
situation
where
a
registrant
claims
that
he
is
employed
in
the
national
interest
and
let's
suppose
that
he
says
that
he
is
employed
in
an
electronics
factory
making
radar
scopes
for
jet
fighter
planes.
now
in
that
case,
we
do
believe
that
the
board,
if
there's
no
reason
to
doubt
the
truth
of
the
facts,
would
be
required
to
reopening
consider
that
claim
on
the
merits.
the
situation
might
be
different
if
there
were
another
case
in
which
the
registrant
alleged
that
he
was
employed
in
such
and
such
a
factory
and
the
board
had
very
recently
decided
in
the
case
on
the
merits
that
someone
doing
exactly
what
this
registrant
was
doing
was
not
in
the
national
interest.
perhaps
in
that
case,
the
board
would
be
justified
in
claiming
to
reopen
without
full
consideration.
the
third
example
would,
in
this
area
would
almost
be
humorous
but
in
the
situation
which
is
very
clear
that
the
occupation
is
not
deferrable
and
said
that
he
was
a
good
humorous
salesman
or
something
like
that.
we
think
that
the
board
could
deny
a
reopening.
now,
the
third
example
is
the
situation
of
the
conscientious
objector
and
as
the
cases
illustrate,
there
are
two
issues
for
the
board
to
resolve
on
the
merits
in
that
case,
first
is,
what
is
the
character
of
the
registrants
belief?
that
is
what
does
--
what
does
he
really
–
i
will
put
this
way,
what
does
he
say
that
he
believes
concerning
his
moral
objection
to
participation
in
war?
what
is
the
nature
of
that
belief?
the
second
issue
is
the
sincerity
of
this
belief
that
is
--
does
he
really,
genuinely
believe
what
he
says
he
believes
about
participation
in
war
or
is
this
a
claim
of
convenience?
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
there
is
some
disagreement
among
the
circuits,
mr.
justice,
on
this.
i
think
the
six
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes,
it
is.
it's
illustrated
its
position
in
somewhat
of
a
different
context
in
the
gearey
line
of
cases.
but
of
course,
those
cases
did
involve
a
claim
of
conscientious
objection
made
after
an
induction
notice
has
been
sent
but
very
similar
issues
are
presented
by
this
case.
we
would
submit
that
in
most
instances,
that
second
issue
for
the
board
to
resolve
that
i
said,
whether
this
man
really
believes
what
he
says
he
believes.
“what's
in
his
mind?”
is
a
question
that
could
not
be
resolved
by
the
board
without
a
reopening
which
would
give
the
registrant
an
opportunity
--
a
formal
opportunity
for
appearance
before
the
board
and
appeal
to
the
state
appeals
board.
we
would
say
however,
that
there
might
certain
cases
in
which
even
that
claim,
that
issue
can
be
resolved
by
the
board
without
a
reopening.
if
the
registrant
claims
that
his
conscientious
objection
to
military
service
is
based
for
example
upon
study
in
a
monastery
or
in
a
divinity
school
or
a
strong
association
with
the
peace
church
or
a
peace
group
and
the
board
finds
by
reliable
means
that
those
allegations
are
untrue.
it
might
make
the
decision
without
reopening
that
this
registrant
is
insincere
in
his
claim.
i
think
that's
a
justifiable
decision
in
this
case
and
in
all
these
other
lines
of
cases.
if
there's
any
prejudice
that
would
result
to
the
registrant
in
that
case,
in
any
of
those
cases
from
the
board's
erroneous
view,
the
registrant
could
learn
what
the
reason
could
a
local
board's
decision
was
and
if
it
secured
erroneous
information,
he
could
correct
the
record
and
the
case
would
proceed
from
that
point.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
right
because
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
they
could
write
a
letter.
depending
upon
what
the
claim
was,
write
a
letter
to
the
source
from
which
that
claim
originates.
the
referent
in
a
statement
of
fact
and
if
the
referent
writes
back
in
a
letter
that
looks
like
it
comes
from
the
referent,
that
says,
“i've
never
heard
of
the
registrant.
he
has
never
been
engaged
in
any
peace
work
with
our
organization,
never
been
employed
in
our
plant,
never
attended
our
school.”
i
would
submit
that
that
would
be
a
basis
for
the
board
saying,
“no,
you
haven't
made
out
a
case
on
the
--
you
haven't
alleged
facts
which
if
true
would
justify
your
reclassification.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
don't
know.
i
do
know.
i
do
know
that
they
verify
academic
deferments
in
some
way
--
few
correspondents
with
the
universities
and
colleges.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
usually
done
but
i
believe
that
there
is
some
practice
of
verifying
with
him.
there's
certainly
nothing
in
the
regulations
which
would
preclude
the
board
from
doing
that
and
indeed
1625.1
(c)
appears
to
contemplate
that
the
board
will
do
that.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
sir.
nothing
would.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
it
depends
on
the
type
of
claims
that
he
makes
to
support
his
claim
for
being
a
conscientious
objector,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
if
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
if
i
were
faced
with
a
fully
ripened
claim
of
conscientious
objection
which
appeared
to
be
based
upon
some
long
standing
belief,
some
basis
in
--
at
the
individuals
--
in
the
registrant's
religious
doctrines.
if
the
claim
was
premised
to
--
it
was
evidenced
by
prior
statements
of
objection
to
participation
in
war
and
activities
to
objection
to
participation
in
war.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
i
don't
think
i
could
do
that
in
10
minutes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
but
that's
not
the
case
here.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
sir?
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
am
not
sure
--
i
don't
know
the
full,
the
fact
to
which
you
refer.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
seager
case.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
don't
know
how
long
it
took
them
to
resolve
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
justice,
well,
i
intend
to
get
to
in
a
few
minutes
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
--
is
the
phrasing
of
what
issue
was
before
the
local
selective
service
board
in
this
case
and
what
inquiry
it
was
making.
the
inquiry
that
it
was
making
was
not
the
inquiry
that
i
suggested
earlier.
now,
well,
do
you
really
believe
what
you
said
you
believe?
the
inquiry
before
the
local
board
and
this
is
evidence
in
answer
to
an
earlier
question
by
mr.
justice
harlan
by
what
the
board
said
it
did
after
the
interview.
the
inquiry
before
the
board
was
“is
this
man
really
claiming
a
conscientious
objection
to
warn
any
form
or
is
he
rehearsing,
the
positions
that
he
is
taking
with
respect
to
the
importance
of
this
civilian
employment?"
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
--
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
harlan.
that
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
it's
not
a
very
good
record
to
reach
in
and
decide
exactly
what
the
local
board
did
in
this
case.
my
recollection
of
the
record
is
correct
only
two
of
the
board
members
testified
as
to
the
basis
for
their
conclusion
in
this
case
that
the
classification
should
not
be
reopened
and
both
of
those
testified
in
effect
that
what
this
man
was
really
saying
to
us
is
what
he
had
said
before
that
he
believes
that
his
participation
in
the
appalachia
volunteers
is
a
critical
and
vital
matter
--
both
to
him
and
to
the
community
and
that
it
would
be
immoral,
if
you
will,
to
take
him
away
to
fight
in
vietnam
at
this
time.
so,
i
am
not
--
i
approach
my
discussion
of
what
the
record
shows
in
this
case
with
a
bit
of
hesitancy
because
the
board
members
hardly
were
articulate
in
their
views
and
it's
not
a
very
good
case
to
decide.
that's
what
i
have
tried
to
concentrate
mostly
upon
the
legal
standards
of
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
mr.
justice,
we
believe
that
the
regulations
and
fundamental
fairness
contemplate
that
result.
the
regulations
do
contemplate
that
an
individual
who
doesn't
alleged
facts
which
if
true
would
justify
a
reclassification.
it
does
not
get
a
reopening
and
it
does
not
get
an
appearance
before
the
board
and
an
appeal
and
we
believe
that
that
is
an
appropriate
regulation
and
a
fair
regulation
because
what
it
does
is
to
prevent
really
the
kind
of
situation
that
mr.
justice
stewart
was
suggesting
in
his
colloquy
with
mr.
sedler,
that
is
you
first
start
with
the
united
states
senator
then
go
to
congressman
and
go
on
and
on
and
on
and
run
down
the
line.
you
do
run
out
of
time
so,
i
think
that
i've
tried
to
state
that
the
fundamental
premise
of
our
legal
position
which
is
that
the
board
--
it
is
very
necessary
for
the
board
to
have
some
means
of
disposing
of
meritless
cases.
some
way
to
decide
and
if
it
is
a
preliminary
matter
whether
a
case
has
merit
or
doesn't
have
merit
principally
or
whether
it
alleges
the
necessary
facts
to
justify
reclassification,
but
also
to
suggest
some
of
the
issues
which
the
board
can
reach
in
making
that
decision
consistent
with
the
regulation,
consistent
with
fundamental
fairness.
now,
the
remaining
time,
i
would
like
to
go
through
it
and
just
to
illustrate
to
the
court
the
kind
of
facts
and
allegations
that
the
local
board
was
confronted
with
in
this
case
which
would
suggest
the
reason
for
inquiry
and
some
of
the
--
and
justify
our
argument,
i
believe
that
what
the
board
decided
was
based
upon
facts
that
it
fairly
had
before.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
i
think
--
i
would
like
to
speak
to
that
and
perhaps
--
this
time
perhaps
to
dispose
off
it,
but
we
have
discussed
it
at
some
length
in
our
brief
and
i
don't
intend
to
go
into
it
very
deeply.
i
disagree
with
mr.
sedlers
statement
that
the
decision
was
made
to
deny
reopening
on
the
afternoon
of
november
9th,
although
there
is
some
support
in
the
record
for
mr.
sedlers
statement.
i
believe
that
the
record
taken
as
a
whole
including
the
further
testimony,
including
the
testimony
of
a
board
member
who
wasn't
even
there
at
that
interview
but
who
read
the
file,
read
the
petitioner's
file,
read
the
summary
of
his
interview
and
then
decided
on
january
11
to
vote
against
reopening.
i
think
that
the
record
as
a
whole
shows
that
these
–
that
even
though
there
might
have
been
a
disposition
against
reopening
by
those
members
who
were
present
at
the
november
9th
meeting
that
that
disposition
did
not
ripen
into
a
decision
until
january
11th,
until
they
had
all
read
the
file,
until
they
had
given
it
mature
consideration.
as
to
the
question,
as
to
whether
they
knew
what
they
were
doing.
i
don't
believe
that
that's
really
supported
by
the
record
at
all.
there
is
some
very
cursory,
very
short
examination
of
what
i
would
concede
to
be
quite
inarticulate
board
members
which
related
very,
very
specifically
to
the
labels
of
classifications
to
be
given
and
i
don't
think
that
it
can
be
concluded
on
that
basis
that
these
board
members
were,
i
believe,
mr.
sedler
has
used
the
word
incompetent
to
decide
this
claim.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
believe
so.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
right
but
i
think
what
we
have
to
look
to
in
this
case
is
that
there
was
a
proceeding,
there
was
a
personal
interview
with
the
registrant
before
the
local
board
in
which
he
did
have
that
chance
to
separate
out
the
considerations
to
tell
the
local
board
exactly
what
his
religious
beliefs
were
and
what
his
conscientious
beliefs
were
to
focus
on
them.
and
then
and
to
alleviate
any
possible
confusion
which
the
board
had
and
we
have
two
board
members
after
that
interview
in
which
we
must,
we
must
presume
that
they
gave
him
fair
consideration
at
that
time,
fairly
tried
to
resolve
any
doubts.
they
said
that
what
this
man
essentially
wants,
what
he
considers
important
is
his
work
at
the
appalachia
volunteers.
and
to
illustrate
that
mr.
justice
marshall,
i'd
like
to
jump
ahead
of
myself
and
go
to
the
letter
which
petitioner
wrote
to
his
local
board
after
that
interview
and
i
think
it's
a
very
revealing
letter.
he
starts
out,
this
on
page
58,
59
of
the
appendix.
he
starts
out
by
saying,
“i've
been
thinking
about
the
short
interview
i
had
with
you
all
last
week.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
all
the
points
were
covered
that
should've
been
and
that
i
was
not
able
to
fully
express
my
position
of
conscience.”
that's
a
way
he
starts
out.
he
has
some
reservations
that
he
didn't
get
across
to
the
board
when
he
really
wanted
to
get
across
to
them.
but
what
is
he
going
on
to
say.
he
starts
out
by
saying,
“these
are
certainly
trouble
times
in
this
country.”
then
he
talks
about
discrimination
and
poverty,
the
coming
revolution,
“another
revolution
is
beginning
to
take
place
in
this
country.
i,
of
course,
hope
that
this
revolution
takes
a
non-violent
form
but
i
remind
you
that
i'm
an
organizer,
that
i've
dedicated
my
life
to
change
into
the
constant
struggle
that
is
democracy.
there
is
nothing
that
can
stop
me
from
organizing
against
something
that
i
don't
believe.”
and
then
down
the
paragraph
on
page
59,
“i
told
you
that
i
felt
i
was
serving
my
country's
needs
here
in
pike
county.”
that
was
no
frivolous
statement.
the
problems
are
too
great
to
be
ignored
any
longer
and
no
one
should
be
sent
to
another
country
as
long
as
we
are
in
the
mess
we're
in.
so,
that's
what
he
really
wanted
to
get
across
to
the
board.
this
is
a
letter
written
some
three
days
after
his
interview.
so,
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
that
even
though
we
have
--
we
don't
know
exactly
what
he
said
in
that
interview.
we
have
the
fact
to
the
interview.
we
have
the
ambiguities
in
the
petitioner's
own
form
which
i'm
going
to
bring
out
just
a
second
and
we
have
a
local
board
that
we
must
presume
gave
fair
consideration
concluding
what
the
man
really
wanted
was
what
he
had
before.
an
opportunity
to
continue
his
organizing
work
in
appalachia
and
i
think
that
that's
clearly
demonstrated
by
his
subsequent
letter.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
think
that's
right
mr.
chief
justice
and
while
you
have
mentioned
that
point,
i'd
like
to
go
back
and
to
clarify
any
ambiguity
which
might
have
arisen
from
the
government's
brief
on
the
question
of
sincerity.
we
believe
that
the
question
before
the
board
is
that
the
question
of
the
board
phrased
for
itself
was.
this
is
a
very
sincere
young
man.
but
is
he
a
very
sincere
or
what?
and
the
way
that
the
board
resolved
that
was
that
he's
a
very
sincere
appalachia
volunteer
who
believed
that
it
was
essential
for
him
and
it's
a
matter
of
conscience
for
him
to
remain
in
his
present
work
organizing
the
poor
in
appalachia.
so,
the
board
--
the
board
did
not
in
any
way
suggested
that
petitioner
was
being
mendacious
or
less
than
candid
with
them.
i
think
that
it
decided
that
what
the
petitioner
wanted
was
a
continuation
of
his
classification.
now,
to
go
on
--
i'm
just
going
to
take
some
highlights
from
the
petitioner's
selective
service
conscientious
objector
form
which
is
form
150
in
this
printed
page
--
beginning
at
page
15
of
the
appendix
and
to
go
on
to
page,
over
to
page
16,
there
is
a
series
of
questions
which
the
petitioner
answered
at
length
in
an
appendix.
he
didn't
use
the
forms.
but
question
number
three
was,
“explain
how,
when,
and
from
whom
or
from
what
source
you
received
the
training
and
acquired
the
belief
which
is
the
basis
of
your
claim
made
in
series
one.”
the
claim
made
in
series
one
that
he's
conscientiously
opposed
to
military
service
in
any
form.
and
he
began
his
long
answer
to
that
question
on
page
19
of
the
appendix,
it
goes
on
to
say
that
--
it
starts
by
saying,
he
was
born
to
catholic
parents
and
inspired
by
missionary
orders
and
had
apparently
catholic
school
training
up
to
high
school
then
become
deeply
troubled
and
faced
a
religious
crisis
and
incidentally
attempted
suicide.
then
after
that,
he
says,
he
began
to
get
back
on
the
right
track
and
came
under
the
influence
of
thomas
merton
who
was
then
residing
in
a
monastery
in
kentucky.
and
he
says
that
merton
was
very
influential
when
he's
formulating
his
views.
and
then
he
reaches
in
on
page
21
for
the
whole
rest
of
the
answer
to
talk
about
the
inspiration
of
his
work
as
an
appalachia
volunteer
and
his
credo
is
set
forth
at
the
bottom
of
page
21,
i
suppose.
"as
i
grew
and
participated
in
the
world,
i
was
able
to
determine
a
priority
on
the
things
i
learned
as
a
child."
thus,
i
place
love
of
my
fellowmen
above
regular
church
attendance
and
i
place
'thou
shall
not
kill'
above
'an
eye
for
an
eye'.
i
learned
rapidly
in
my
work
in
the
southern
highlands
that
the
significance
of
love
and
understanding
and
the
futility
of
violence
and
force.
too
many
poor
people
have
been
used
and
walked
on
by
the
power-hungry
courthouse
gangs.
there
was
an
urgent
need
for
the
poor
to
become
organized
and
the
rich
to
be
educated.
this
must
be
done
in
a
non-violent
way.
"violence
only
breeds
violence."
this
is
what
appears
to
be
a
culmination
of
what
he
should
have
been
alleging
to
be
a
religious
--
religiously
founded
opposition
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
it's
our
position
that
there
--
the
ambiguities
inherent
in
that
statement
and
other
statements
which
i
perhaps
will
get
a
chance
to
read
plus
statements
of
the
registrant
which
so
plainly
indicated
to
him
the
primary
importance
of
his
work
tended
to
justify
the
board's
conclusion
or
did
justify
the
board's
conclusion
that
it
ought
not
to
try
to
piece
together
the
various
individual
statements
which
might
have
justified
a
reclassification
in
order
to
decide
whether
to
reopen.
we
don't
doubt
mr.
justice
black
that
if
you
did
do
what
i
suggested
early
in
the
argument
to
piece
all
these
statements
together
and
what
you
might
regard
as
a
brief
for
the
conscientious
objector
to
resolve
any
ambiguities
in
his
favor
and
to
disregard
its
significant
emphasis
on
his
belief
in
the
importance
of
his
job
but
you
could
conclude
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
there
are
--
there
are
i
believe
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
i
don't
believe
so
mr.
justice
black.
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
other
statements
which
he
made
in
his
form
suggested
that
this
wasn't
the
--
that
this
wasn't
the
primary
thrust
of
his
belief.
it
was
a
statement
which
stands
out.
i
mean,
it's
a
sufficient
--
it's
a
sufficient
allegation
perhaps
of
conscientious
objection
just
as
assigning
the
first
line
of
that
form
is
a
sufficient
allegation
of
conscientious
objection.
but
we
don't
believe
that
the
board
is
required
to
reopen
and
give
full
consideration
just
merely
because
the
individual
signs
that
statement.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
we
think
that
we
--
you
know,
i
--
all
i've
got
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
all
i've
got
is
the
statement
of
the
board
members
that
their
conclusion,
the
basis
of
their
consideration
and
after
the
courtesy
interview
was
that
what
this
man
really
wanted
was
that
--
now,
then
the
question
really
becomes
well,
who
bears
the
risk
of
non-persuasion
if
it
resolves
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
it's
not
a
strong
record.
if
i
have
to
reach
to
that
point,
then
all
i
can
--
i
can
elaborate
on
the
record,
i
can
just
say
what
it
says
but
in
answer
to
your
penultimate
statement,
what
i
try
to
do
early
in
the
argument
is
to
say
that
there
maybe
enough
here
if
you
piece
it
together
the
right
way.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
since
mr.
sedler
has
taxed
the
government
for
changing
its
position
during
this
litigation.
it
seems
appropriate
for
me
to
restate
the
government's
position
at
the
outset
of
my
argument.
i
think
i
can
do
so
in
two
propositions
which
i
will
briefly
describe
and
then
return
to
each
in
more
detail.
the
first
proposition
relates
to
what
we
believe
to
be
the
basic
issue
of
law
in
this
case.
that
is,
what
inquiries
can
a
local
board
make
and
what
issues
can
it
resolved
concerning
a
request
for
reclassification
without
the
board
being
deemed
to
have,
in
fact,
reopen
the
classification.
section
1625.4
of
the
regulations
clearly
specifies
two
issues
which
are
for
the
primary
determination
by
the
board
in
deciding
whether
to
reopen.
the
first
is
whether
the
facts
alleged
by
the
registrant,
if
true,
would
justify
a
change
in
the
registrant's
classification.
the
second
issue
is
whether
the
facts
presented
are
new
facts
which
were
not
considered
by
the
board
at
the
time
the
registrant
was
classified.
the
discretionary
language
of
1625.2
also
demonstrates
that
there
are
other
issues
which
may
be
resolved
by
the
board
without
a
reopening.
thus,
we
believe
that
the
board
may
in
certain
circumstances
decide
the
critical
facts
are
not
true
and
therefore,
the
reclassification
would
not
be
justified.
the
board
also
may
reach
certain
conclusions
about
the
facts
alleged
and
deny
reopening
on
that
basis,
thus,
in
certainly
--
certain
narrowly
defined
classes
of
cases
which
i
will
illustrate
presently.
the
board
may
conclude
that
the
registrant's
civilian
work
is
not
in
the
national
interest
or
that
its
claim
of
conscientious
objection
is
not
a
sincerely
held
belief.
interpreted
in
this
manner,
we
believe
that
the
regulation
affords
a
necessary
flexibility
to
the
selective
service
system
to
dispose
off
meritless
applications
without
full
administrative
procedures.
this
is
necessary
as
we
show
in
our
brief
in
order
to
prevent
the
administrative
system
from
becoming
bogged
down
with
such
applications
and
to
prevent
disingenuous
registrants
from
postponing
and
perhaps
avoiding
military
service.
our
second
proposition
relates
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
we
submit
that
what
the
local
board
did
in
this
case
was
to
conclude
that
petitioner
had
not
set
forth
facts
which
would
justify
conscientious
objector
classification.
because
the
true
premise
for
his
claim
was
his
belief
in
the
importance
of
his
work
in
appalachia.
this
is
the
determination
which
the
board
has
clearly
authorized
to
make.
and
as
i
hope
to
demonstrate
later
in
this
argument,
the
board
had
a
rational
basis
when
the
facts
of
this
case
for
making
that
determination.
and
mr.
sedler
has
stated
that
the
government
has
conceded
that
there
was
a
prima
facie
basis
--
prima
facie
case
for
reclassification.
the
government
has
made
this
concession
and
i
should
clarify
our
position.
we
believe
that
certain
of
the
facts
set
forth
in
petitioners
form
150
and
in
the
accompanying
letters,
taken
together
with
all
doubts
resolved
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
and
with
all
inconsistent
information
disregarded
would
have
constituted
a
prima
facie
case.
but
the
question
for
the
local
board
was
whether
it
should
try
to
piece
together
the
favorable
information,
resolve
doubts
in
favor
of
the
petitioner,
and
disregard
his
own
statements
that
seemed
inconsistent
with
his
claim.
that
was
the
question
which
the
board
resolved
after
its
courtesy
interview
with
the
petitioner.
it
decided
that
there
was
no
reason
to
reopen
because
the
facts
as
explained
by
the
petitioner
did
not
justify
reclassification.
now
as
to
the
point
of
law
involved
in
this
case,
i
would
like
to
give
three
illustrations
of
what
i
think
would
be
the
government's
position
as
to
what
inquiries
the
board
can
make
without
reopening
and
what
issues
it
can
resolve
without
reopening.
i
think
the
first
illustration
was
elicited
in
mr.
sedlers
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
stewart
concerning
the
question,
whether
the
registrant
is
a
student
at
x
college,
whether
he
is
a
united
states
senator
or
perhaps
whether
his
wife
is
pregnant
as
he
alleges.
we
believe
that
the
discretion
granted
to
the
board
in
section
1625.2
allows
the
board
to
inquire
into
that
critical
fact,
if
true
and
if
the
fact
is
found
not
true,
then
to
deny
a
reopening
on
that
basis.
the
second
illustration
that
i
would
give
is
a
situation
where
a
registrant
claims
that
he
is
employed
in
the
national
interest
and
let's
suppose
that
he
says
that
he
is
employed
in
an
electronics
factory
making
radar
scopes
for
jet
fighter
planes.
now
in
that
case,
we
do
believe
that
the
board,
if
there's
no
reason
to
doubt
the
truth
of
the
facts,
would
be
required
to
reopening
consider
that
claim
on
the
merits.
the
situation
might
be
different
if
there
were
another
case
in
which
the
registrant
alleged
that
he
was
employed
in
such
and
such
a
factory
and
the
board
had
very
recently
decided
in
the
case
on
the
merits
that
someone
doing
exactly
what
this
registrant
was
doing
was
not
in
the
national
interest.
perhaps
in
that
case,
the
board
would
be
justified
in
claiming
to
reopen
without
full
consideration.
the
third
example
would,
in
this
area
would
almost
be
humorous
but
in
the
situation
which
is
very
clear
that
the
occupation
is
not
deferrable
and
said
that
he
was
a
good
humorous
salesman
or
something
like
that.
we
think
that
the
board
could
deny
a
reopening.
now,
the
third
example
is
the
situation
of
the
conscientious
objector
and
as
the
cases
illustrate,
there
are
two
issues
for
the
board
to
resolve
on
the
merits
in
that
case,
first
is,
what
is
the
character
of
the
registrants
belief?
that
is
what
does
--
what
does
he
really
–
i
will
put
this
way,
what
does
he
say
that
he
believes
concerning
his
moral
objection
to
participation
in
war?
what
is
the
nature
of
that
belief?
the
second
issue
is
the
sincerity
of
this
belief
that
is
--
does
he
really,
genuinely
believe
what
he
says
he
believes
about
participation
in
war
or
is
this
a
claim
of
convenience?
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
there
is
some
disagreement
among
the
circuits,
mr.
justice,
on
this.
i
think
the
six
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes,
it
is.
it's
illustrated
its
position
in
somewhat
of
a
different
context
in
the
gearey
line
of
cases.
but
of
course,
those
cases
did
involve
a
claim
of
conscientious
objection
made
after
an
induction
notice
has
been
sent
but
very
similar
issues
are
presented
by
this
case.
we
would
submit
that
in
most
instances,
that
second
issue
for
the
board
to
resolve
that
i
said,
whether
this
man
really
believes
what
he
says
he
believes.
“what's
in
his
mind?”
is
a
question
that
could
not
be
resolved
by
the
board
without
a
reopening
which
would
give
the
registrant
an
opportunity
--
a
formal
opportunity
for
appearance
before
the
board
and
appeal
to
the
state
appeals
board.
we
would
say
however,
that
there
might
certain
cases
in
which
even
that
claim,
that
issue
can
be
resolved
by
the
board
without
a
reopening.
if
the
registrant
claims
that
his
conscientious
objection
to
military
service
is
based
for
example
upon
study
in
a
monastery
or
in
a
divinity
school
or
a
strong
association
with
the
peace
church
or
a
peace
group
and
the
board
finds
by
reliable
means
that
those
allegations
are
untrue.
it
might
make
the
decision
without
reopening
that
this
registrant
is
insincere
in
his
claim.
i
think
that's
a
justifiable
decision
in
this
case
and
in
all
these
other
lines
of
cases.
if
there's
any
prejudice
that
would
result
to
the
registrant
in
that
case,
in
any
of
those
cases
from
the
board's
erroneous
view,
the
registrant
could
learn
what
the
reason
could
a
local
board's
decision
was
and
if
it
secured
erroneous
information,
he
could
correct
the
record
and
the
case
would
proceed
from
that
point.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
right
because
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
they
could
write
a
letter.
depending
upon
what
the
claim
was,
write
a
letter
to
the
source
from
which
that
claim
originates.
the
referent
in
a
statement
of
fact
and
if
the
referent
writes
back
in
a
letter
that
looks
like
it
comes
from
the
referent,
that
says,
“i've
never
heard
of
the
registrant.
he
has
never
been
engaged
in
any
peace
work
with
our
organization,
never
been
employed
in
our
plant,
never
attended
our
school.”
i
would
submit
that
that
would
be
a
basis
for
the
board
saying,
“no,
you
haven't
made
out
a
case
on
the
--
you
haven't
alleged
facts
which
if
true
would
justify
your
reclassification.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
don't
know.
i
do
know.
i
do
know
that
they
verify
academic
deferments
in
some
way
--
few
correspondents
with
the
universities
and
colleges.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
usually
done
but
i
believe
that
there
is
some
practice
of
verifying
with
him.
there's
certainly
nothing
in
the
regulations
which
would
preclude
the
board
from
doing
that
and
indeed
1625.1
(c)
appears
to
contemplate
that
the
board
will
do
that.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
sir.
nothing
would.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
it
depends
on
the
type
of
claims
that
he
makes
to
support
his
claim
for
being
a
conscientious
objector,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
if
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
if
i
were
faced
with
a
fully
ripened
claim
of
conscientious
objection
which
appeared
to
be
based
upon
some
long
standing
belief,
some
basis
in
--
at
the
individuals
--
in
the
registrant's
religious
doctrines.
if
the
claim
was
premised
to
--
it
was
evidenced
by
prior
statements
of
objection
to
participation
in
war
and
activities
to
objection
to
participation
in
war.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
i
don't
think
i
could
do
that
in
10
minutes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
but
that's
not
the
case
here.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
sir?
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
am
not
sure
--
i
don't
know
the
full,
the
fact
to
which
you
refer.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
seager
case.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
don't
know
how
long
it
took
them
to
resolve
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
justice,
well,
i
intend
to
get
to
in
a
few
minutes
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
--
is
the
phrasing
of
what
issue
was
before
the
local
selective
service
board
in
this
case
and
what
inquiry
it
was
making.
the
inquiry
that
it
was
making
was
not
the
inquiry
that
i
suggested
earlier.
now,
well,
do
you
really
believe
what
you
said
you
believe?
the
inquiry
before
the
local
board
and
this
is
evidence
in
answer
to
an
earlier
question
by
mr.
justice
harlan
by
what
the
board
said
it
did
after
the
interview.
the
inquiry
before
the
board
was
“is
this
man
really
claiming
a
conscientious
objection
to
warn
any
form
or
is
he
rehearsing,
the
positions
that
he
is
taking
with
respect
to
the
importance
of
this
civilian
employment?"
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
--
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
harlan.
that
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
it's
not
a
very
good
record
to
reach
in
and
decide
exactly
what
the
local
board
did
in
this
case.
my
recollection
of
the
record
is
correct
only
two
of
the
board
members
testified
as
to
the
basis
for
their
conclusion
in
this
case
that
the
classification
should
not
be
reopened
and
both
of
those
testified
in
effect
that
what
this
man
was
really
saying
to
us
is
what
he
had
said
before
that
he
believes
that
his
participation
in
the
appalachia
volunteers
is
a
critical
and
vital
matter
--
both
to
him
and
to
the
community
and
that
it
would
be
immoral,
if
you
will,
to
take
him
away
to
fight
in
vietnam
at
this
time.
so,
i
am
not
--
i
approach
my
discussion
of
what
the
record
shows
in
this
case
with
a
bit
of
hesitancy
because
the
board
members
hardly
were
articulate
in
their
views
and
it's
not
a
very
good
case
to
decide.
that's
what
i
have
tried
to
concentrate
mostly
upon
the
legal
standards
of
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
mr.
justice,
we
believe
that
the
regulations
and
fundamental
fairness
contemplate
that
result.
the
regulations
do
contemplate
that
an
individual
who
doesn't
alleged
facts
which
if
true
would
justify
a
reclassification.
it
does
not
get
a
reopening
and
it
does
not
get
an
appearance
before
the
board
and
an
appeal
and
we
believe
that
that
is
an
appropriate
regulation
and
a
fair
regulation
because
what
it
does
is
to
prevent
really
the
kind
of
situation
that
mr.
justice
stewart
was
suggesting
in
his
colloquy
with
mr.
sedler,
that
is
you
first
start
with
the
united
states
senator
then
go
to
congressman
and
go
on
and
on
and
on
and
run
down
the
line.
you
do
run
out
of
time
so,
i
think
that
i've
tried
to
state
that
the
fundamental
premise
of
our
legal
position
which
is
that
the
board
--
it
is
very
necessary
for
the
board
to
have
some
means
of
disposing
of
meritless
cases.
some
way
to
decide
and
if
it
is
a
preliminary
matter
whether
a
case
has
merit
or
doesn't
have
merit
principally
or
whether
it
alleges
the
necessary
facts
to
justify
reclassification,
but
also
to
suggest
some
of
the
issues
which
the
board
can
reach
in
making
that
decision
consistent
with
the
regulation,
consistent
with
fundamental
fairness.
now,
the
remaining
time,
i
would
like
to
go
through
it
and
just
to
illustrate
to
the
court
the
kind
of
facts
and
allegations
that
the
local
board
was
confronted
with
in
this
case
which
would
suggest
the
reason
for
inquiry
and
some
of
the
--
and
justify
our
argument,
i
believe
that
what
the
board
decided
was
based
upon
facts
that
it
fairly
had
before.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
i
think
--
i
would
like
to
speak
to
that
and
perhaps
--
this
time
perhaps
to
dispose
off
it,
but
we
have
discussed
it
at
some
length
in
our
brief
and
i
don't
intend
to
go
into
it
very
deeply.
i
disagree
with
mr.
sedlers
statement
that
the
decision
was
made
to
deny
reopening
on
the
afternoon
of
november
9th,
although
there
is
some
support
in
the
record
for
mr.
sedlers
statement.
i
believe
that
the
record
taken
as
a
whole
including
the
further
testimony,
including
the
testimony
of
a
board
member
who
wasn't
even
there
at
that
interview
but
who
read
the
file,
read
the
petitioner's
file,
read
the
summary
of
his
interview
and
then
decided
on
january
11
to
vote
against
reopening.
i
think
that
the
record
as
a
whole
shows
that
these
–
that
even
though
there
might
have
been
a
disposition
against
reopening
by
those
members
who
were
present
at
the
november
9th
meeting
that
that
disposition
did
not
ripen
into
a
decision
until
january
11th,
until
they
had
all
read
the
file,
until
they
had
given
it
mature
consideration.
as
to
the
question,
as
to
whether
they
knew
what
they
were
doing.
i
don't
believe
that
that's
really
supported
by
the
record
at
all.
there
is
some
very
cursory,
very
short
examination
of
what
i
would
concede
to
be
quite
inarticulate
board
members
which
related
very,
very
specifically
to
the
labels
of
classifications
to
be
given
and
i
don't
think
that
it
can
be
concluded
on
that
basis
that
these
board
members
were,
i
believe,
mr.
sedler
has
used
the
word
incompetent
to
decide
this
claim.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
believe
so.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
right
but
i
think
what
we
have
to
look
to
in
this
case
is
that
there
was
a
proceeding,
there
was
a
personal
interview
with
the
registrant
before
the
local
board
in
which
he
did
have
that
chance
to
separate
out
the
considerations
to
tell
the
local
board
exactly
what
his
religious
beliefs
were
and
what
his
conscientious
beliefs
were
to
focus
on
them.
and
then
and
to
alleviate
any
possible
confusion
which
the
board
had
and
we
have
two
board
members
after
that
interview
in
which
we
must,
we
must
presume
that
they
gave
him
fair
consideration
at
that
time,
fairly
tried
to
resolve
any
doubts.
they
said
that
what
this
man
essentially
wants,
what
he
considers
important
is
his
work
at
the
appalachia
volunteers.
and
to
illustrate
that
mr.
justice
marshall,
i'd
like
to
jump
ahead
of
myself
and
go
to
the
letter
which
petitioner
wrote
to
his
local
board
after
that
interview
and
i
think
it's
a
very
revealing
letter.
he
starts
out,
this
on
page
58,
59
of
the
appendix.
he
starts
out
by
saying,
“i've
been
thinking
about
the
short
interview
i
had
with
you
all
last
week.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
all
the
points
were
covered
that
should've
been
and
that
i
was
not
able
to
fully
express
my
position
of
conscience.”
that's
a
way
he
starts
out.
he
has
some
reservations
that
he
didn't
get
across
to
the
board
when
he
really
wanted
to
get
across
to
them.
but
what
is
he
going
on
to
say.
he
starts
out
by
saying,
“these
are
certainly
trouble
times
in
this
country.”
then
he
talks
about
discrimination
and
poverty,
the
coming
revolution,
“another
revolution
is
beginning
to
take
place
in
this
country.
i,
of
course,
hope
that
this
revolution
takes
a
non-violent
form
but
i
remind
you
that
i'm
an
organizer,
that
i've
dedicated
my
life
to
change
into
the
constant
struggle
that
is
democracy.
there
is
nothing
that
can
stop
me
from
organizing
against
something
that
i
don't
believe.”
and
then
down
the
paragraph
on
page
59,
“i
told
you
that
i
felt
i
was
serving
my
country's
needs
here
in
pike
county.”
that
was
no
frivolous
statement.
the
problems
are
too
great
to
be
ignored
any
longer
and
no
one
should
be
sent
to
another
country
as
long
as
we
are
in
the
mess
we're
in.
so,
that's
what
he
really
wanted
to
get
across
to
the
board.
this
is
a
letter
written
some
three
days
after
his
interview.
so,
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
that
even
though
we
have
--
we
don't
know
exactly
what
he
said
in
that
interview.
we
have
the
fact
to
the
interview.
we
have
the
ambiguities
in
the
petitioner's
own
form
which
i'm
going
to
bring
out
just
a
second
and
we
have
a
local
board
that
we
must
presume
gave
fair
consideration
concluding
what
the
man
really
wanted
was
what
he
had
before.
an
opportunity
to
continue
his
organizing
work
in
appalachia
and
i
think
that
that's
clearly
demonstrated
by
his
subsequent
letter.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
think
that's
right
mr.
chief
justice
and
while
you
have
mentioned
that
point,
i'd
like
to
go
back
and
to
clarify
any
ambiguity
which
might
have
arisen
from
the
government's
brief
on
the
question
of
sincerity.
we
believe
that
the
question
before
the
board
is
that
the
question
of
the
board
phrased
for
itself
was.
this
is
a
very
sincere
young
man.
but
is
he
a
very
sincere
or
what?
and
the
way
that
the
board
resolved
that
was
that
he's
a
very
sincere
appalachia
volunteer
who
believed
that
it
was
essential
for
him
and
it's
a
matter
of
conscience
for
him
to
remain
in
his
present
work
organizing
the
poor
in
appalachia.
so,
the
board
--
the
board
did
not
in
any
way
suggested
that
petitioner
was
being
mendacious
or
less
than
candid
with
them.
i
think
that
it
decided
that
what
the
petitioner
wanted
was
a
continuation
of
his
classification.
now,
to
go
on
--
i'm
just
going
to
take
some
highlights
from
the
petitioner's
selective
service
conscientious
objector
form
which
is
form
150
in
this
printed
page
--
beginning
at
page
15
of
the
appendix
and
to
go
on
to
page,
over
to
page
16,
there
is
a
series
of
questions
which
the
petitioner
answered
at
length
in
an
appendix.
he
didn't
use
the
forms.
but
question
number
three
was,
“explain
how,
when,
and
from
whom
or
from
what
source
you
received
the
training
and
acquired
the
belief
which
is
the
basis
of
your
claim
made
in
series
one.”
the
claim
made
in
series
one
that
he's
conscientiously
opposed
to
military
service
in
any
form.
and
he
began
his
long
answer
to
that
question
on
page
19
of
the
appendix,
it
goes
on
to
say
that
--
it
starts
by
saying,
he
was
born
to
catholic
parents
and
inspired
by
missionary
orders
and
had
apparently
catholic
school
training
up
to
high
school
then
become
deeply
troubled
and
faced
a
religious
crisis
and
incidentally
attempted
suicide.
then
after
that,
he
says,
he
began
to
get
back
on
the
right
track
and
came
under
the
influence
of
thomas
merton
who
was
then
residing
in
a
monastery
in
kentucky.
and
he
says
that
merton
was
very
influential
when
he's
formulating
his
views.
and
then
he
reaches
in
on
page
21
for
the
whole
rest
of
the
answer
to
talk
about
the
inspiration
of
his
work
as
an
appalachia
volunteer
and
his
credo
is
set
forth
at
the
bottom
of
page
21,
i
suppose.
"as
i
grew
and
participated
in
the
world,
i
was
able
to
determine
a
priority
on
the
things
i
learned
as
a
child."
thus,
i
place
love
of
my
fellowmen
above
regular
church
attendance
and
i
place
'thou
shall
not
kill'
above
'an
eye
for
an
eye'.
i
learned
rapidly
in
my
work
in
the
southern
highlands
that
the
significance
of
love
and
understanding
and
the
futility
of
violence
and
force.
too
many
poor
people
have
been
used
and
walked
on
by
the
power-hungry
courthouse
gangs.
there
was
an
urgent
need
for
the
poor
to
become
organized
and
the
rich
to
be
educated.
this
must
be
done
in
a
non-violent
way.
"violence
only
breeds
violence."
this
is
what
appears
to
be
a
culmination
of
what
he
should
have
been
alleging
to
be
a
religious
--
religiously
founded
opposition
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
it's
our
position
that
there
--
the
ambiguities
inherent
in
that
statement
and
other
statements
which
i
perhaps
will
get
a
chance
to
read
plus
statements
of
the
registrant
which
so
plainly
indicated
to
him
the
primary
importance
of
his
work
tended
to
justify
the
board's
conclusion
or
did
justify
the
board's
conclusion
that
it
ought
not
to
try
to
piece
together
the
various
individual
statements
which
might
have
justified
a
reclassification
in
order
to
decide
whether
to
reopen.
we
don't
doubt
mr.
justice
black
that
if
you
did
do
what
i
suggested
early
in
the
argument
to
piece
all
these
statements
together
and
what
you
might
regard
as
a
brief
for
the
conscientious
objector
to
resolve
any
ambiguities
in
his
favor
and
to
disregard
its
significant
emphasis
on
his
belief
in
the
importance
of
his
job
but
you
could
conclude
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
there
are
--
there
are
i
believe
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
i
don't
believe
so
mr.
justice
black.
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
other
statements
which
he
made
in
his
form
suggested
that
this
wasn't
the
--
that
this
wasn't
the
primary
thrust
of
his
belief.
it
was
a
statement
which
stands
out.
i
mean,
it's
a
sufficient
--
it's
a
sufficient
allegation
perhaps
of
conscientious
objection
just
as
assigning
the
first
line
of
that
form
is
a
sufficient
allegation
of
conscientious
objection.
but
we
don't
believe
that
the
board
is
required
to
reopen
and
give
full
consideration
just
merely
because
the
individual
signs
that
statement.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
we
think
that
we
--
you
know,
i
--
all
i've
got
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
all
i've
got
is
the
statement
of
the
board
members
that
their
conclusion,
the
basis
of
their
consideration
and
after
the
courtesy
interview
was
that
what
this
man
really
wanted
was
that
--
now,
then
the
question
really
becomes
well,
who
bears
the
risk
of
non-persuasion
if
it
resolves
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
it's
not
a
strong
record.
if
i
have
to
reach
to
that
point,
then
all
i
can
--
i
can
elaborate
on
the
record,
i
can
just
say
what
it
says
but
in
answer
to
your
penultimate
statement,
what
i
try
to
do
early
in
the
argument
is
to
say
that
there
maybe
enough
here
if
you
piece
it
together
the
right
way.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
