justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
it
can
be
--
this
record
--
what
reading
for
the
board's
action?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
the
issue
of
law
in
this
case
very
narrow,
namely,
what
does
it
take
to
trigger
a
consideration
of
a
reopening
of
a
classification.
justice
potter
stewart
you
got
all
there
is
to
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
you
got
the
second
circuit
or
some
other
circuits,
principally
the
second
saying
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
show
a
prima
facie
case
on
paper
and
you
got
other
circuits
including
this
one
saying,
“no,
there's
more
discretion
in
the
board
didn't
ask
even
though
its
prima
facie
showing
on
paper
that
they
didn't
like
to
do
some
kind
of
an
evaluation
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
have
i
so
stated
the
issue
correctly?
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
let's
say,
according
to
--
as
i
understand
it
then,
you
already
said
the
board
is
without
discretion
if
they
are
presented
to
at
allegations
that
if
true
would
entitle
the
registrant
to
a
new
or
different
classification.
justice
potter
stewart
would
that
be
right?
so,
in
other
words
and
the
time
process
involved
in
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
personal
appearance
or
reopening
of
personal
appearance
set
on
appeal
is
a
matter
of
months,
i
suppose
all
know
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
i
suppose
the
registrant
could
say
i
am
now
a
member
of
the
united
states
senate
even
though
that
word
demonstrably
false
and
therefore
i
ask
her
reclassification
as
member
of
the
united
states
senate.
and
according
to
your
submission
as
i
understand
it,
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
the
board
to
grant
him
a
personal
appearance
and
that
reopen
his
--
reopen
his
classification
and
find
that,
“no,
he
wasn't
a
member
of
the
united
states
senate
at
all.”
but
then
there
would
be
an
appeal
and
then
he
could
say,
“well,
next
time
--
well,
now
i
am
a
member
of
the
fbi
or
i
am
member
of
a
--
or
am
i
m
a
divinity
student.”
and
just
go
through
the
various
exemptions
and
deferments
until
everybody
ran
out
of
time
and
he
was
over
26
years
old,
is
that
--
a
registrant
couldn't
do
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
you
went
long
enough,
he
could
reach
46,
if
he
had
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
you
can,
so
long
as
there's
an
allegation,
does
this
have
to
be
made
under
oath?
justice
potter
stewart
does
it
have
to
be
made
under
oath?
do
you
have
to
swear
to
this,
you
don't,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
you
just
write
him
a
letter,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
or
maybe
out
of
form
provided
the
board?
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
agree
mr.
connolly
with
your
adversary
that
the
circuits
are
at
odds
on
what
the
standard
for
reopening
is?
justice
potter
stewart
second
circuit
is
partly
against
these
decisions,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
said
the
board
finds
by
reliable
means
that
--
that
what
he
says
is
not
true
or
they
find
that
they
think
it's
not
true,
what
kind
or
what
sort
of
reliable
means
are
they
going
to
find
out
about
this?
all
they
have
is
his
statement,
his
allegation.
there's
no
response
as
i
understand
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
an
adversary
proposition.
justice
potter
stewart
do
selective
service
boards
actually
write
letters
to
these

the
usual
practice,
i

is
to
have
the
registrant
himself,

for

the

support
for
it,
