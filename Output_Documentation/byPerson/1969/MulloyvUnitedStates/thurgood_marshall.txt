justice
thurgood
marshall
but
nothing
like
that
was
done
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
how
long
would
it
take
you
or
i
to
find
out
whether
the
man
was
a
conscientious
objector?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
think
you
could
do
it
in
10
minutes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
order
to
satisfy
your
own
conscience
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
it
take
you
-
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
it
take
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
it
take
as
long
as
the
second
circuit
took
to
decide
seager?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
it
take
you
as
long
as
it
took
the
second
circuit
to
decide
seager?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
seager
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
it
could
take
that
long
–
i
don't
find
a
little
merit
in
this
ten
minute
hearing
or
something
is
serious
as
this
is,
admittedly
serious.
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
i
am
sorry.
i
am
sorry.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
connolly,
will
you
include
in
that
the
charge
that's
made
that
the
board
didn't
know
what
they
were
doing?
i
think
the
two
go
together.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
it
mean
if
somebody
mistakenly
had
accepted
a
job
deferment
during
some
kind
of
work
that
this
man
was
doing,
but
he
was
a
conscientious
objector,
he
believed
in
all
other
things
that
seager
believed
in
but
he
thought
that
this
was
a
type
of
work
which
was
in
exchange
for
him
being
not
drafted
and
then
somebody
tells
him,
“look,
if
you
are
a
conscientious
objector,
you
have
to
set
forth
that
you
want
this
because
you
are
a
conscientious
objector.”
and
then,
he
says,
he
could
be
reclassified
as
a
conscientious
objector,
could
he
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
be
not
--
but
you
say,
in
this,
he
has
got
all
the
two
of
them
combined
together
without
any
means
of
you
separated?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
nothing
like
that
was
done
