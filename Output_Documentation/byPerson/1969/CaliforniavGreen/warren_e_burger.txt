today's
calendar
for
argument
is
number
387,
california
against
john
anthony
green.
mr.
james,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
availability
of
the
primary
speaker
in
the
courtroom
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
california
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
it
is
under
the
proposed
federal
rule?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
do
not
see
this
as
conflict
with
any
prior
decision
of
this
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
douglas
case,
this
court
equated
the
assertion
of
the
fifth
amendment
right
as
being
the
same
as
not
being
present,
not
being
available?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
california
proceed
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
you
finished
justice
--
can
california
proceed
by
way
of
information
or
indictment
by
a
grand
jury
without
any
preliminary
hearing
at
all
if
they
want
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
not
by
information?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
to
have
that
clear,
the
preliminary
hearing
is
an
absolute
right
if
they
proceed
by
charge
by
information
but
not
so
by
grand
jury
indictment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
general.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
was
just
looking
at
mr.
prettyman's
brief
for
green,
i
don't
see
that
he
raises
any
question
unless
i've
missed
it
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
how
does
--
how
does
that
process
avoid
our
getting
into
the
evaluation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
you're
saying
is
that
it's
none
of
our
business
really
but
that
we
should
take
a
quick
look
at
it
and
do
something
about
it,
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
prettyman.
before
you
get
underway
mr.
prettyman,
may
i
ask
if
you
know
because
i'm
not
sure
i
could
see
it
in
the
record
whether
in
the
california
supreme
court
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
support
the
verdict
was
urged
by
the
petitioner
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
appear
on
what
you
have
just
confirmed
about
the
situation
in
the
california
supreme
court
that
they
reached
out
of
their
way
for
a
constitutional
issue
when
they
could
have
disposed
to
this
case
on
what
you
and
solicitor
general
suggest
is
a
relatively
routine
non
constitutional
ground.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
the
reverse
of
what
was
once
thought
the
orthodox
approach
to
the
problem,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
go
to
--
if
i
may
interrupt
you
there
mr.
prettyman,
does
that
go
you
think
primarily
to
admissibility
or
to
weight?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
if
it
is
not
unusual
in
criminal
or
civil
case
to
have
inconsistencies
and
disparities
as
wide
as
what
appear
in
this
record
e.
barrett
prettyman,
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
from
two
different
witness
or
from
the
same
witness
with
internal
inconsistencies
on
direct
and
cross
examination.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
if
we
didn't
have
the
out
of
court
statement
at
all,
the
preliminary
hearing
statement,
it
had
one
version
on
direct
examination
and
the
other
version
precisely
as
they
now
stand
in
the
record
on
cross
examination,
that
this
should
be
purely
a
weight
of
the
evidence
question
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
suspend
for
lunch
now
mr.
prettyman.
mr.
prettyman
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
as
justice
harlan
suggested
to
you,
all
of
these
arguments
could
be
made
on
the
dying-declaration
exception
--
couldn't
they
really?
and
nothing
but
i
think
justice
harlan
called
it
tradition.
and
presumably
behind
that
tradition
a
long
human
experience
supports
the
exception.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
of
course,
there's
another
factor
there
mr.
prettyman
that
he
may
have
been
dissembling
at
the
second
trial.
we
--
no
one
has
any
way
of
knowing
subjectively
what
was
the
motivation
behind
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
prettyman,
when
you
say
that
this
is
the
universal
view
of
trial
lawyers,
how
would
you
reconcile
that
with
the
recommendation
with
the
american
college
of
trial
lawyers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
certainly
contains
some
of
the
most
eminent
trial
lawyers
in
this
country
and
a
great
many
of
them
with
approval
of
exactly
what
solicitor
general
and
the
attorney
general
of
california
are
arguing
here
today?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i
was
suggesting
the
misstated
or
overstated.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
prettyman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
prettyman,
you
acted
at
the
appointment
of
the
court
at
our
request,
we
thank
you
for
your
assistance
to
the
defendant
and
to
the
court
as
well.
mr.
solicitor
general,

thank
you,
mr.
