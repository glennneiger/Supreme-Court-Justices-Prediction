justice
potter
stewart
before
you
proceed
to
the
facts
to
this
case
general
james,
is
there
any
available
evidence
showing
the
legislative
history
of
this
amendment
in
the
california
code
relating
to
evidence,
any
--
is
there
anything
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
you
know
off
that
shows
why
the
state
legislature
did
this?
justice
potter
stewart
these
notes
indicate
what?
that
this
was
in
response
to
some
sort
of
a
felt
need
or
was
just
as
the
academic
rule
and
these
commissioners
were
academic
people
and
they
thought
they
got
to
put
on
that
rule,
what
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
have
here
two
types
of
a
prior
statement.
one,
statement
under
oath
under
preliminary
hearing
of
which
a
transcript
was
made
in
a
magistrate
proceeding?
justice
potter
stewart
on
one
end
and
additionally
an
unsworn
statement
made
in
no
judicial
proceeding
but
made
to
an
officer,
to
made
to
an
officer
while
at
the
--
of
the
juvenile
court?
justice
potter
stewart
unsworn?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
may
or
may
not
be
a
difference
with
respect
to
the
two,
i
know
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
shouldn't
have
involved
in
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
did
and
the
supreme
court
of
california
confesses
error
with
respect
to
the
later?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
why
--
right,
because
by
previous
state
court
decision?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
so
the
fact
is
you
did
confess
error
but
submitted
it
that
the
error
was
harmless
error,
wasn't
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
is
this
testimony
that
he
was
giving
at
the
trial
or
is
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
--
excuse
me
a
bit.
was
the
defendant
represented
by
a
lawyer
in
the
preliminary
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
that
makes
any
difference?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
reason
suggested
why
you
shouldn't
is
the
confrontation
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment
in
answer
to
justice
black's
question?
justice
potter
stewart
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
there
is
counsel
there,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
the
defendant
was
there?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
bridges,
you're
talking
about
bridges?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
suggesting
that
even
if
all
of
this
evidence
was
properly
admitted
as
you
say
it
should
have
that
as
you
say
it
was,
that
there
would
remain
a
question
of
whether
or
not
even
with
this
prosecution
evidence
there
was
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
the
defendant's
guilt
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
but
that
that's
the
matter
we
should
leave
to
the
california
court?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i'm
getting
a
little
confused.
are
we
talking
about
the
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
part
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
lets
--
may
ask
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
let's
assume
you
prevail
and
that
the
court
decides
that
neither
the
fourteenth
amendment
insofar
as
it
incorporates
a
sixth
amendment,
no
other
fourteenth
amendment,
simplicitaire
plano
requires
the
exclusion
of
this
evidence
and
that
the
california
supreme
court
was
wrong
in
holding
that
the
united
states
constitution
requires
the
exclusion
of
the
evidence,
do
you
still
say
that
with
the
inclusion
of
this
evidence
there
might
remain
a
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
the
defendant's
guilt
but
that
that's
a
matter
for
the
state
of
california?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
bridges
was
a
--
without
a
due
process
of
attempt
mostly,
didn't
it
rather
than
confrontation?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
was
a
federal
case
and
they
didn't
mention,
they
really
seem
to
talk
due
process,
didn't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
thought
that
ordinarily
when
we
get
certain
circumstances
like
that
in
the
state
case,
we
remand
for
proceedings
not
inconsistent
because
we
don't
think
we
ought
to
get
to
be
on
the
issues
raised
by
the
petitioner
in
the
state
case,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
rather
an
important
distinction
we
make
--
justice
potter
stewart
--between
state
and
federal
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
even
assuming
all
the
evidence
was
properly.
justice
potter
stewart
did
state
use
both
of
those
statements?
justice
potter
stewart
this
final
statement
that
he
made
after
trial
in
a
extra
judicial
sworn
statement
is
really
--
really
doesn't
go
very
much
to
the
issue
before
us,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
not
in
the
california
courts.
justice
potter
stewart
it
does
however
rather
go
from
more
to
the
question
of
whether
admitting
all
this
evidence
at
the
trial,
was
a
proof
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt,
might
be
with
the
witness
such
as
this.
justice
potter
stewart
well
subject
to
all
the
rule
--
constitutional
rules
developed
over
the
years
with
respect
to
involuntary
confessions.
justice
potter
stewart
right
apart
from
miranda.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
that's
perhaps
not
quite
accurate
with
respect
to
the
federal
rule
that
with
respect
to
co-conspirators
but
that's
generally
understood
to
be
a
recognized
exception
hearing
in
the
federal
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
don't
have
a
conspiracy
case?
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
proceed
to
the
facts
to
this

general
james,
is
there
any
