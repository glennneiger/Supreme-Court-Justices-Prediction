mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
was
urged
before
the
california
supreme
court
and
they
reserved
judgment.
i
might
say
that
i
view
the
record
in
this
case
as
the
solicitor
general
does
but
perhaps
with
moral
arm
and
i
have
not
raised
the
issue
in
my
brief
for
this
simple
reason
that
i
was
appointed
after
the
petition
was
filed
and
granted
and
consequently
i
found
myself
bound
by
the
issues
there
presented.
but,
if
for
some
reason,
i
do
not
prevail
here,
i
would
certainly
intend
to
urge
before
the
california
supreme
court
on
remand
that
this
conviction
cannot
stand
on
such
poultry
evidence
as
we
find
in
this
case.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
even
assume
that
it
all
came
in.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
would
urge
the
rule
which
as
i
understand
it
has
not
been
decided
by
this
court
as
to
whether
a
conviction
can
stand
on
the
basis
of
hearsay
law.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
correct.
well
i
would
be
happy
to
present
the
issue
of
insufficiency
and
obtain
a
reversal
on
any
ground
that
i
can.
i'm
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor
i
think
the
confrontation
issue
is
so
square
and
is
so
surely
in
my
favor
that
i
don't
think
i
have
to
urge
that
the
court
do
that.
i
think
that
the
california
court
should
there
be
a
remand
is
fully
able
to
take
care
of
that
situation.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
you
mean
the
hearsay?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
not
at
this
time.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
hope
if
there's
a
remand
and
i'll
be
back
up
at
you
when
that
is
decided
by
the
--
if
it's
decided
adversely
by
the
california
court.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
of
course
i
can't
speak
for
the
court
but
i
would
guess
that
since
they
said
that
this
evidence
shouldn't
have
been
in
the
case
in
the
first
place
that
they
didn't
find
it
necessary
to
reach
the
question
of
what
would
have
happened
if
it
had
gotten
there.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
concede
it.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i'm
fortunate
in
having
the
case
in
which
the
facts
so
dramatically
illustrate
the
dangers
of
adopting
the
position
that
are
searched
by
the
state
by
solicitor
general.
i
would
like
to
review
those
facts
briefly
even
though
they
have
been
touched
on
before
because
of
some
very
important
facts
have
not
been
mentioned
to
you.
the
key
witness
in
this
case
and
in
fact,
the
only
witness
to
the
alleged
crime
was
a
16-year
old,
name
melvin
porter.
in
footnote
2
of
my
brief,
i
have
listed
a
series
of
comments
about
this
witness
from
the
judge
and
the
prosecutor.
and
i
think
that
the
most
kindly
and
restrained
way
of
summarizing
their
attitude
toward
him
is
to
say
that
they
considered
him
a
worthless
liar.
and
yet
it
was
he
and
he
alone
who
convicted
mr.
green.
mr.
green
at
that
time
was
24
years
old.
and
according
to
the
state,
he
gave
or
sold
some
marihuana
to
porter.
now
how
did
the
state
prove
this
case?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
think
what
i'm
going
to
demonstrate
to
you
your
honor
is
how
it
was
impossible
for
the
defendant
to
have
true
and
effective
confrontation
in
this
case.
and
i
think
i
can
develop
it
for
you
through
the
facts
and
the
situation
that
he
was
confronted
with,
how
he
was
denied
confrontation
in
the
same
senses
if
the
witness
had
not
even
been
on
the
stand
or
if
he
had
been
pleading
self
incrimination.
before,
during
and
after
the
trial
in
this
case,
this
16-year
old
made
four
separate
and
self
conflicting
statements
in
regard
to
this
crime.
the
first
one
was
after
mr.
porter
himself
had
been
arrested
and
in
an
effect
that
was
separate
from
the
one
we
have
here.
he
was
arrested
after
selling
marihuana
to
an
undercover
agent
and
he
had
been
incarcerated
for
four
days
at
the
time
he
made
this
first
statement.
the
police
officer,
officer
wade
interrogated
him
at
the
juvenile
headquarters.
now
only
the
two
of
them
were
present.
there
was
no
lawyer
either
for
the
defendant
green
or
for
the
defendant
porter.
no
witness,
no
stenographer,
just
the
two
of
them
after
this
young
boy
had
been
in
jail
for
four
days.
according
to
wade,
porter
told
him
that
some
weeks
before,
mr.
green
had
called
him
and
then
he'd
come
by
his
house
and
brought
with
him
a
bag
of
marihuana.
the
second
statement
was
made
at
the
preliminary
hearing
of
mr.
green
after
he
had
been
arrested
as
a
result
of
the
first
statement.
mr.
porter
was
still
in
custody
of
the
police,
still
in
jail.
his
case
had
not
yet
been
disposed
off.
that
hearing
was
held
only
eight
days
after
mr.
green's
arrest.
and
at
the
hearing,
porter
testified
this
time,
not
that
green
had
brought
a
bag
of
marihuana
to
this
house
but
rather
that
he
had
come
and
taken
mr.
porter
over
to
the
house
of
mr.
green's
father
and
it
showed
him
some
marihuana
behind
a
bush
and
mr.
porter
had
comeback
on
his
own
that
night
or
the
next
day
and
picked
it
up.
now
i
might
say
that
there
are
number
of
inconsistencies
between
these
first
two
statements
and
the
state
has
never
yet
attempted
to
reconcile
those
inconsistencies.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
do
think
however
though
when
you
consider
that
these
are
the
only
two
statements
that
convicted
this
man,
he
was
not
convicted
upon
any
testimony
or
trial.
he
was
convicted
on
the
basis
of
these
two
statements.
i
think
that
there
is
some
burden
on
somebody's
part
to
reconcile
the
conflicts.
we
don't
even
know
from
the
trial
judge
whether
he
relied
on
the
first
statement,
the
second
statement
or
both
statements,
we
have
no
idea.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
you
would
not
have
the
conflict
you
have
here
but
i'm
trying
to
demonstrate
that
to
go
back
as
the
state
would
do
and
say,
well
these
prior
statements
are
more
likely
to
be
true
because
they
are
earlier
in
time
doesn't
face
up
to
the
issue
that
the
two
statements
themselves
don't
coincide
one
with
the
other.
i
think
it
goes
to
the
point
about
what
kind
of
witness
is
this
and
the
necessity
for
having
him
give
his
convicting
statement
in
front
of
the
trier
of
fact
and
not
back
before
some
police
officer
or
at
some
previous
hearing.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
officer
wade
to
whom
the
first
statement
had
been
given
did
not
testify
and
no
mention
was
made
of
that
first
statement
and
therefore
porter's
attorney
had
apparently
had
no
view
of
it,
had
no
idea
that
he'd
given
a
previous
inconsistent
statement.
another
thing
about
the
preliminary
hearing
was
that
porter's
attorney
apparently
knew
nothing
about
the
lsd
that
was
going
to
develop
later
because
not
a
single
solitary
mention
of
lsd
was
made
at
that
preliminary
hearing.
now
we
go
on
to
the
third
statement.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i'm
saying
the
point
of
confront
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i'm
saying,
if
i
may
state
it
just
a
little
differently
mr.
justice
harlan
that
the
point
of
confrontation
is
to
look
the
witness
in
the
eye,
have
the
trier
of
fact
looking
in
the
eye,
not
as
he's
talking
about
some
other
statement
that
he
made
at
some
other
time
but
when
he's
talking
about
the
crime.
when
he's
saying
the
words
that
convict
this
whole
cross
examination,
the
trial
was
not
about
the
crime
and
a
cross
examination
was
--
well
now,
did
you
say
something
to
somebody
else
back
there
and
he
is
saying,
i
really
don't
--
i'm
really
not
sure,
i
can't
remember.
the
third
statement
now
was
given
a
trial.
and
at
this
point,
it's
important
to
note
that
this
young
man
was
no
longer
in
custody.
his
own
case
had
been
disposed
off.
this
is
the
first
time
now
that
he
is
out
of
the
hands
of
the
police
and
what
is
he
testified
to
now?
he
says
“well,
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
of
it,
i
took
lsd
about
20
minutes
before
mr.
green
called
me
and
i'm
not
sure
what
happened
thereafter.”
he
didn't
know
whether
mr.
green
had
come
by
his
house,
he
didn't
know
whether
if
he
came
by
the
house,
he
left
anything,
he
didn't
know
where
he
got
the
marihuana
because
he'd
been
under
the
influence
of
lsd.
it
was
less
apparent
to
the
state
that
they
could
not
convict
mr.
green
on
the
testimony
in
court.
this
was
the
only
testimony
of
this
crime.
so
what
do
they
do?
they
turn
around
and
have
the
officer
come
in
and
say,
well,
he
told
me
down
in
juvenile
headquarters,
such
and
such
and
then
they
read
to
the
witness
from
portions
about
1/4th
of
the
testimony
at
the
preliminary
hearing
including
i
might
say
about
1/4th
of
the
cross
examination.
they
read
this
testimony
to
the
witness
and
they
say,
didn't
you
say
that
at
the
preliminary
hearing?
if
you
look
on
page
7
of
my
brief,
you
will
see
in
the
footnote
his
various
replies
to
these
questions
about
what
he
had
said
before
if
there
was
ever
a
young
man
who
was
confused.
who
seemed
to
be
saying
six
different
things
at
once,
it
was
this
young
man.
but
the
best
we
can
make
out
of
all
this
testimony
was,
well,
if
i
said
it
before,
perhaps
it
was
true
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
because
of
my
condition,
i
don't
know
anything
about
the
crime.
now
because
of
these
two
sections
of
the
california
code,
these
prior
two
statements,
the
one
to
the
officer
and
the
one
at
the
preliminary
hearing
where
the
young
man,
both
arms
was
under
police
control,
those
were
the
statements
that
convicted
mr.
green.
nothing
that
was
said
at
trial
could
have
convicted
him
because
the
only
direct
evidence
at
trial
was
that
he
didn't
know
what
had
happened.
the
fourth
statement
from
this
young
man
was
made
after
trial.
and
it
was
in
a
sworn
statement
which
he
said
he
was
making
at
the
suggestion
of
his
probation
officer.
and
here
he
said,
he'd
not
gotten
the
marihuana
from
mr.
green,
he'd
gotten
it
from
the
gentleman
named
plughead
7315
that
mr.
green
was
entirely
innocent
at
the
offense
and
that
he,
mr.
porter
had
made
these
statements
because
of
police
threats
when
it
was
in
their
hands
and
because
he
was
unable
to
distinguish
between
reality
and
fantasy.
now
both
the
intermediate
appellate
court
and
the
california
supreme
court
unanimously
held
that
mr.
green
was
denied
his
right
of
confrontation.
now,
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
except
that
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
except
to
this
extent
mr.
justice
that
it
was
made
part
of
the
record
as
the
part
of
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
i
think
that
if
you
review
the
four
statements
and
see
the
incredible
inconsistencies,
i
think
to
view
any
statement
made
by
this
man
as
evidence
even
if
you
look
back
to
the
prior
too
simply
won't
wash.
this
fourth
statement
is
part
of
the
pattern
of
four
totally
inconsistencies.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
agree.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
let
me
see
if
i
understand
you.
he
gets
on
the
stand
and
he
gives
one
statement.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
then
they
attempt
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
i
think,
conceivably
that
might
be
used
solely
to
impeach
and
incidentally
i
have
some
question
even
on
that
because
in
order
at
least
in
the
federal
courts
to
impeach,
you
have
to
have
both
the
price
and
affirmative
damaging
evidence
given
for
the
other
side
which
you
don't
have
in
the
case
of
this
lsd
testimony.
but
assuming
that
you
could
use
it
only
to
impeach,
i
certainly
don't
agree
that
you
could
use
the
prior
statement
for
the
truth
of
the
facts
therein.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir,
i
certainly
don't
and
i'll
show
you
why
shortly.
now
the
state
has
a
quite
simple
argument,
i
think
deceptively
so.
and
in
some
ways
it
seems
to
have
a
certain
appeal.
they
say
quite
simply
that
so
long
as
the
witness
is
available
at
trial
so
that
the
trier
of
fact
can
look
him
in
the
eye
what
possible
harm
can
be
done
in
putting
in
these
prior
statements.
well,
the
answer
is
a
great
deal
of
harm
could
be
done.
the
right
to
confrontation
in
order
to
have
any
substance,
in
order
to
have
any
meaning
if
its
not
going
to
become
an
empty
right,
must
mean
that
there's
going
to
be
something
more
than
having
a
witness,
a
body
available
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
three
basic
ingredients
of
the
right
of
cross
confrontation
which
i
would
like
to
discuss.
all
three
of
which
were
missing
in
this
case.
the
first
one
is
perhaps
the
least
important
of
the
three
but
nevertheless
i
think
it's
a
factor.
it's
the
requirement
that
the
witness
make
the
incriminating
statement
at
the
crucial
hearing
itself
so
that
the
subjective
moral
impact
of
the
courtroom
is
brought
to
bear
on
it.
so
that
he
fully
realizes
the
importance,
a
seriousness,
the
gravity
of
the
proceeding
and
the
necessity
for
telling
the
truth.
i'm
not
going
to
elaborate
this
except
to
say
that
it's
a
very
far
crime
from
giving
the
statement
to
a
police
officer
and
juvenile
headquarters
than
it
is
from
giving
it
under
oath
before
a
judge
or
a
jury
facing
the
defendant
in
the
courtroom
itself
where
the
issue
of
innocence
or
guilt
is
going
to
be
decided.
the
second
basic
ingredient
is
viewing
the
contemporaneous
demeanor
of
that
witness.
the
concept
that
the
witness
will
make
his
incriminating
statements
in
front
of
the
trier
of
fact
so
that
the
trier
of
fact
then
and
there
as
the
words
are
said
can
determine
whether
this
man
is
telling
the
truth.
now
the
state
says
that
you
can
judge
his
demeanor
at
trial
as
he's
asked
about
his
statement.
but
is
the
demeanor
at
trial
in
any
way
comparable
to
the
demeanor
on
the
prior
occasion,
of
course
not.
porter
in
the
hands
of
the
police
implicates
green.
porter
out
of
the
hands
of
the
police
fails
to
implicate
green.
we
can
see
his
non-implicating
demeanor
at
trial
but
his
implicating
demeanor
is
lost
to
as
forever.
there's
no
way
we
can
go
back
and
pick
that
up.
the
state's
position
assumes
that
you
can
judge
at
trial
whether
or
not
the
witness
is
lying
at
trial
and
therefore
you
can
make
an
assumption
about
prior
truth
but
that's
just
as
himself.
in
this
case,
if
the
judge
at
trial
found
that
porter
was
telling
the
truth
about
taking
lsd,
it
follows
of
course
that
green's
conviction
cannot
stand
because
porter
said
that
the
effect
of
the
lsd
was
such
that
he
simply
did
not
know
the
facts
about
the
crime.
but
what
if
the
judge
at
the
trial
didn't
believe
the
story
about
lsd?
what
can
that
possibly
prove
about
the
two
prior
statements?
porter
could
have
lied
in
his
first
statement,
he
could
have
lied
in
his
second
statement,
he
could
or
he
could
have
lied
a
trial
or
all
three
occasions.
it's
not
enough
to
see
the
man's
demeanor
now,
weeks
or
months
after
those
statements
were
made.
you
got
to
be
able
to
compare
demeanors
to
see
the
demeanor
now
and
the
demeanor
then.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there's
a
very
great
danger
here.
because
i
think
that
there
is
a
tendency
to
feel
when
a
man
is
lying
at
trial.
if
he
has
made
a
prior
statement
that
is
different
to
feel
automatically
that
the
other
statement
must
be
true.
but
that
again
just
isn't
so,
in
this
case
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
your
honor.
in
the
case
of
the
dying-declaration,
you
have
two
elements
that
are
lacking
here.
one
is,
there
is
an
assumption
that
if
the
witness
were
available.
if
he
was
here
at
trial,
he
would
tell
the
same
story
that
he
told
before.
you
assume
that.
here,
that's
completely
refuted
and
rebutted
because
when
the
man
gets
on
the
stand
at
the
trial
and
you're
looking
him
in
the
eye,
he
has
a
different
story
to
tell.
the
other
thing
about
the
dying-declaration
is
that
it
has
a
very
high
degree
of
probability
of
truthfulness.
the
courts
have
always
assumed
perhaps
rightly
or
wrongly,
that
a
man
on
his
death
bed
is
going
to
tend
to
tell
the
truth.
what
element
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case
point
out
rather
dramatically
the
dangers
here.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but,
there
are
other
cases
which
pointed
out
just
as
well.
and
now
that
you've
asked
me
about
that,
let
me
turn
to
the
case
that
the
state
is
asking
you
to
overrule
today
although
you
denied
certiorari
when
it
came
up
to
you
before.
in
california
versus
johnson,
you
had
a
mother
and
a
young
daughter
testifying
before
the
grand
jury
that
the
father
had
incest
with
the
daughter.
now,
this
is
before
the
grand
jury
where
the
defendant
cannot
be
present.
his
counsel
is
not
allowed
to
be
present.
when
the
mother
and
the
daughter
got
on
the
stand
to
trial,
what
do
they
say?
the
mother
said,
i'll
tell
you
why,
who
told
that
story
because
he
beat
me
up
and
i
was
mad
at
him.
and
the
daughter
said,
i
told
the
story
because
he
found
out
i
was
a
member
of
a
sex
club
in
high
school
and
he
turned
my
name
over
to
the
us
attorney.
they
said
the
stories
just
are
not
true
and
they
convicted
that
man
on
the
basis
of
the
grand
jury
testimony.
that's
the
rule
that
the
state
is
asking
you
to
adopt.
they
say
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
and
i
incidentally
i
make
the
distinction
between
a
civil
and
criminal
proceeding
although
the
solicitor
general
doesn't.
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
i
think
the
against
interest
rule
goes
out
the
window.
i
think
that
in
a
criminal
proceeding
where
you
have
not
had
the
opportunity
for
discovery
of
the
facts
as
you
do
in
several
proceeding,
you,
the
prosecution
has
to
rest
on
the
evidence
that
it
develops
at
trial
at
least
for
the
truth.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
because
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
case
of
the
dying-declaration,
it's
not
just
a
question
of
a
probability
of
truth.
it
is
more
basic
assumption
that
if
the
man
were
here,
he'd
say
the
same
thing.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
only
for
impeachment
purposes
but
not
for
the
truth
of
what
they
say.
i
say
that
a
man
could
be
convicted
in
a
criminal
trial,
has
to
have
the
evidence
against
him
introduced
at
the
trial
where
the
person
as
he
says
the
words
can
be
looked
in
the
eye
by
the
trier
of
fact
and
he
can
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
alright,
suppose
he
testifies
and
he
says
in
truth
and
fact,
what
i
said
in
this
alleged
confession
is
simply
untrue.
it
was
extracted
out
of
me
by
force.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
except
possibly
for
impeachment
purposes
and
possibly
i
think
the
danger
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
but
not
against
the
--
not
against
the
defendant
absolutely.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
of
course
you
have
a
double
problem
in
bruton
because
you
have
as
you
recalled
a
instruction
to
the
jury,
it's
not
to
be
considered
against
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
putting
that
aside,
i
say
absolutely
that
the
prosecution
has
to
contend
itself
with
the
evidence
that
they
can
produce
before
the
trier
of
fact.
they
cannot
as
in
this
case
rely
solely
upon
evidence
that
was
developed
out
of
the
sight
in
the
trier
of
fact.
that
is
written,
spoken
words
that
the
trier
of
fact
has
not
seen
and
which
the
defendant
cannot
even
find
out
about.
how
can
this
defendant
in
this
case,
when
we
talk
about
the
right
of
cross
examination,
how
was
he
supposed
to
cross
examine
a
man
who
says
he
has
--
knows
nothing
about
the
offense
because
the
taken
lsd,
how
are
they
--
how
is
he
supposed
to
cross
examine
him
about
a
statement
made
to
a
police
officer
at
juvenile
headquarters
when
the
kid
had
been
incarcerated
for
four
days,
nothing
had
happened
at
his
trial,
only
the
two
of
them
were
present.
he
later
says
in
his
fourth
statement,
he
gave
it
partially
because
of
police
threats.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
oh
yes!
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
absolutely
because
the
right
to
confrontation
in
any
meaningful
sense
is
missing.
i
think
that
they
view
the
right
of
confrontation
the
same
way
in
a
comparable
fashion
to
the
right
to
counsel,
they
would
say
so
long
as
you
have
counsel,
that's
all
that's
necessary.
that
isn't
what
this
court
has
said.
it
says
you
have
to
have
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
if
the
counsel
sells
the
man
down
the
river,
you
have
not
had
counsel.
and
here,
it
isn't
enough
to
have
a
body
on
the
stand
that
you
can
throw
questions
at,
you
said
this
in
douglas
versus
alabama
where
you
had
the
witness
present,
available,
he
could
be
asked
questions
but
he
wasn't
answering
them
because
of
self
incrimination.
he
was
denied
effective
confrontation.
and
that's
what's
missing
here
and
that's
what
i
want
to
turn
to.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
i
can
only
say
to
you
that
the
dying-declaration
--
that
the
two
basic
underpinnings
of
the
dying-declaration
are
totally
absent
here.
and
the
only
way
the
dying-declaration
ever
gets
in,
and
it
gets
in
only
in
the
case
of
the
absolute
necessity
of
the
witness
not
being
here.
the
only
way
is
that
you
assume
that
he
would
testify
the
same
and
it
has
a
very
great
degree
of
probability
of
truth.
and
because
of
those
two
factors,
the
courts
have
leaded
in
the
past,
both
of
those
are
missing
now,
the
witness
is
present
and
he's
giving
a
different
story.
and
therefore
you
don't
assume
that
he
gives
the
same,
you
have
to
assume
the
opposite.
and
the
degree
of
probability
of
truth
is
missing.
it
can't
be
said
to
be
present
in
this
case.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
not
the
first
statement,
no
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
wanted
preliminary
hearing
was
under
oath.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
sir,
i'm
going
to
address
myself
very
shortly
to
the
proposition
that
testimony
at
a
preliminary
hearing
is
a
very
far
try,
as
this
court
has
said
from
testimony
at
trial.
and
the
right
of
cross
examination
is
quite
different
at
the
preliminary
hearing
than
it
is
here.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i'll
address
myself
to
it
now.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
for
this
reason.
in
the
first
place,
that
preliminary
hearing
is
held
as
soon
as
possible
after
arrest
and
sometimes
contemporaneously
with
the
appointment
of
counsel.
quite
often
in
the
state
courts
and
even
in
the
federal
courts,
the
first
times
that
they
appointed
attorney
sees
his
man
as
when
he
walks
in
there
to
the
preliminary
hearing
because
he
was
just
appointed.
secondly,
the
issue
at
the
preliminary
hearing
is
a
very
narrow
one.
it's
not
guilt
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt,
it's
whether
there
is
simply
enough
evidence
to
say
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
hold
the
man.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
because
sir,
in
the
first
place,
the
cross
examiner
has
not
able
to
find
the
facts.
in
this
case,
this
trial
attorney
was
retained
no
more
than
six
days
and
perhaps
less.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
was
saying
cross
examination.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
was
saying
cross
examination
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
that
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
in
the
first
place
the
--
as
i
say
the
attorney
who
is
going
to
do
the
cross
examination
simply
has
not
had
time
to
gather
the
facts
to
prepare
for
effective
cross
examination.
in
this
case
for
example,
the
attorney
knew
nothing
about
officer
wade
statement
and
he
knew
nothing
about
lsd
just
by
way
of
examining.
in
the
second
place,
the
courts
are
constantly
striving
to
keep
the
issue
at
the
preliminary
hearing
narrow.
here
in
the
district,
defendants
have
attempted
a
broad
games
cross
examination
attempting
to
use
it
for
discovery
purposes
to
all
of
the
whole
range
of
facts
surrounding
the
case
and
they
have
been
denied
that
right.
the
trial
courts
have
said,
no,
so
long
as
the
issue
is
the
very
narrow
one
of
probable
cause,
that
really
is
all
that
you
can
cross
examine
on.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
one
is
whether
this
probable
cause
to
hold
him
and
the
other
is
whether
there
is
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
those
standards
are
quite
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i'm
sorry
i
can't
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
on
the
other
hand,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
preliminary
is
to
hold
it
as
at
earliest
time
as
possible
so
that
if
you
have
a
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
here
in
the
district,
there
is
a
statute
which
requires
you
to
do
it
within
ten
days
unless
you
waive
it.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
because
the
point
if
it
is
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
they're
asking
you
for
a
rule
though
that's
going
to
apply
to
all
preliminary
hearings
regardless
of
when
they
are
held
and
what
i
am
saying
to
you
is
that
that
--
to
have
a
man
available
for
cross
examination
at
preliminary
hearing
is
simply
not
an
effective
right.
it's
simply
not
as
a
practical
matter,
you
don't
really
--
you
won't
able
to
cross
examine
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
can
only
assure
you
mr.
justice
black
that
it's
quite
different
in
many
jurisdictions
and
that
in
many
cases,
the
lawyer
at
the
preliminary
hearing
isn't
even
the
same
as
the
one
at
trial.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
i
would
still
say
that
if
you
have
a
man
who
gives
one
story
at
the
preliminary
hearing
whether
he's
been
cross
examined
for
eight
days
or
not,
and
he
gets
on
to
stand
at
trial
where
the
issue
is
entirely
different
and
gives
the
different
story
that
the
prosecution
is
stopped
with
the
story
that
the
man
tells
on
the
stand
because
the
trier
of
fact
as
to
ultimate
guilt
is
going
to
look
him
in
the
eye.
in
california,
they
can't
even
be
the
same
judge.
it's
a
different
judge
that
judge
down
at
the
preliminary
hearing
is
a
magistrate
or
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
not
the
same
man
who
is
going
to
appear
when
the
ultimate
issue
of
guilt
is
decided.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
now
i
think
that
this
is
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
think
this
case
illustrates
the
fact
that
there
may
well
have
been
enough
evidence
at
the
preliminary
hearing
for
holding
the
man
but
even
the
solicitor
general
recognizes,
when
you
start
talking
about
ultimate
proof
of
guilt
at
the
trial,
you
get
into
some
serious
difficulty,
it's
an
entirely
different
matter
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
could
think
quite
obviously
that
the
statement
made
to
officer
wade
has
all
kinds
of
problems
to
it.
some
of
which
are
less
serious
in
the
preliminary
hearing
but
what
i'm
saying
is
to
equate
the
preliminary
hearing
and
the
cross
examination
allowed
at
the
preliminary
hearing
with
the
trial
is
simply
not
realistic
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
goes
entirely
against
the
grain
of
what
this
court
has
said
when
itself
has
said
that
the
preliminary
hearing
issues
are
entirely
different.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
putting
which
person?
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
understand
the
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i've
said
to
you
sir
that
i
do
believe
that
there
is
a
difference.
and
that
i
think
the
difficulty
with
the
statement
to
officer
wade
is
a
far
more
serious
one.
but
on
the
other
hand,
it's
--
i
still
think
that
the
--
that
it
is
not
enough
to
have
a
man
at
a
preliminary
hearing
simply
cross
examined.
you
just
--
what
if
you
hold
this
way,
if
you
hold
this
way,
look
what's
going
to
happen
to
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
do
you
realize
the
fantastic
pressure
that
this
is
going
to
be
put
on
counsel
to
prepare
themselves
for
a
full
effective
cross
examination
at
that
preliminary
hearing?
you
have
said
that
counsel
has
to
be
in
a
line
up
because
it
is
a
critical
confrontation
because
not
to
have
in
present
might
derogate
from
the
man's
right
at
trial.
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
these
preliminary
hearings?
the
man
has
to
prepare
himself
fully
just
as
he
would
for
trial
because
otherwise,
he
may
miss
his
only
opportunity
to
tear
this
man's
story
down.
many
of
the
statements
of
course
are
taken
before
there
even
is
a
defendant
such
as
in
the
johnson
case
and
such
as
the
statement
to
officer
wade
here.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
at
the
preliminary
hearing
or
at
the
trial?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
think
this
case
is
the
perfect
example
why,
that
cross
examination
at
trial
in
regard
to
any
previous
statement
is
not
sufficient.
it
simply
is
not.
and
the
reason
is
that
when
you
have
this
man
at
this
trial
who
says,
look,
i
don't
know
anything
about
the
facts
because
i
was
under
the
influence
of
lsd,
you
can
talk
to
him,
tell
you
are
blue
in
the
face
about
some
prior
statement,
what
are
you
going
to
get
him
to
say
just
what
you
did
here.
read
page
7
of
my
brief
and
you
see
these
comments.
he
says
“well
i
don't
know,
i
guess
i
said
it
but
really
i
don't
--
just
don't
know
too
much
about
it.”
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
not
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
we're
getting
towards
the
truth
mr.
justice.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
if
you
mean
getting
further
toward
the
proof
from
the
statement
from
officer
wade,
i
would
agree
that
you
have
a
little
better
chance.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
what
--
the
point
i'm
making
is
what
could
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
now
have
you
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
alright,
if
you
show
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
if
you
show
that
he
is
lying
now,
what
have
you
proved
about
whether
he
was
lying
before?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
would
like
to
think
that's
precisely
what
was
shown
here
but
the
man
was
convicted
on
the
basis
to
his
prior
statements.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
judge
at
trial
mr.
justice,
how
is
he
going
to
know
the
circumstances
under
what
--
under
which
this
man
testified
at
the
preliminary
hearing?
how
is
he
going
to
see
the
fickr
of
buying
on
his
face
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
my
--
i
submit
to
you
that
it
isn't
very
much.
i
submit
to
you
that
he
has
no
opportunity
to
recreate
the
scene
as
the
man
gave
his
testimony
that
you
are
allowing
a
man
to
testify
on
one
occasion
and
use
it
under
other
circumstances,
something
that
is
never
been
done.
this
so
far
as
i
know
has
never
been
done
before.
this
rule
that
they're
asking
for
is
broadly
than
the
common
law
rule.
that
the
very
first
right
under
confrontation
even
before
the
right
to
cross
examine
was
the
right
to
have
the
witness
come
and
appear
at
the
trial
while
he
gave
his
testimony.
that
was
the
most
basic
of
all
rights.
and
i
say
it's
not
enough
to
have
him
crossing
--
cross
examine
now
about
his
prior
statement,
he
should
be
cross
examined
about
what
he
knows
about
the
crime
and
the
facts
of
the
crime.
and
here,
that
right
was
simply
denied.
this
case
was
--
this
man
was
denied,
the
effect
cross
examination
just
as
much
as
he'd
have
a
wooden
body
on
the
stand
because
this
boy
simply
could
imagine
the
questions
he
didn't
know.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
if
i
were
to
guess
and
i
confess
it's
only
a
guess,
i
would
say
that
this
boy
at
trial
really
knew
that
green
did
not
give
him
this
doubt
that
he
got
it
from
10221
and
that
he
finally
decide
it
he
better
get
him
off.
that
is
perfectly
in
conformity
with
his
four
statement
which
in
term
is
supported
by
evidence
actually
at
the
trial
and
it's
just
as
logical
to
assume
that
he
decided
the
trial
to
get
him
off
as
it
is
to
assume
that
one
of
these
prior
statements
which
conflicted
one
with
the
other
was
in
fact
true.
but
at
--
that
is
a
guess
mr.
justice
but
i
don't
think
we
should
be
guessing
about
this
kind
of
thing.
i
think
that
--
i
think
the
man
has
to
get
on
the
stand
and
give
his
story
and
lets
you
judge
him
by
the
way
he
is
giving
it
now.
so
that
when
he
gives
the
incriminating
testimony,
you're
looking
right
in
the
eye
and
you
tell
as
best
you
can,
is
it
true
or
false.
now,
i
would
like
to
pass
in
a
moment
some
remaining
to
me
to
something
which
i
think
is
extremely
important
and
that
is
i've
touched
on
it.
but
i'd
like
to
expand
on
it
a
little
bit.
i'm
concerned
if
you
approve
this
rule
about
what's
going
to
happen
to
this
problem
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
it's
inconceivable
to
me
that
if
these
statements
are
going
to
come
in
that
they
can
come
in
without
counsel
being
present
when
they
were
first
made.
and
look
what's
going
to
happen
now
to
all
of
these
pretrial
proceedings.
motions
to
suppress
evidence,
hearings
on
sanity
and
ability
to
stand
trial,
line
ups,
preliminary
hearings
and
all
the
rest
of
these
pre
trial
proceedings,
every
one
of
these
proceedings
is
going
to
be
turned
in
to
a
forum
for
the
prosecution
to
get
its
statements
down
now
to
get
its
case
put
in
and
they
couldn't
careless
about
the
trial
later.
they
couldn't
careless
whether
the
man
gets
up
and
even
says
i
never
made
this
statement
before
because
under
the
california
statute,
it's
not
even
required
that
he
admit
he
made
them.
so
that
they
could
--
that
you
realize
the
pressure
that
this
is
going
to
put
on
the
police
for
example.
they
got
a
fellow
in
tow
here
down
to
headquarters
for
four
days.
they
could
be
the
confession
out
of
him
and
he
gets
on
the
stand
and
he
says
“i
never
met
a
word
of
it,
they
beat
me
up,”
and
that
first
statement
can
be
used
to
convict.
it's
incredible.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
of
course,
of
course
your
honor
that
we
are
hopeful.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
we
are
hopeful
that
the
facts
would
come
out
and
that
he
could
show
that
he
was
beaten
up.
but
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
even
to
allow
as
a
possibility
that
a
statement
out
of
the
defendant's
presence
under
the
tow
--
the
police
could
be
used
as
the
sole
evidence
at
trial
to
convict
the
man
despite
what
he
says
at
the
trial,
i
think
that's
inconceivable
and
i
think
it
goes
directly
against
every
concept
of
the
confrontation.
you're
going
to
have
statements
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
say
that
if
goes
on
to
stand
at
trial
and
says
in
truth,
what
happened
was
this,
that
the
guy
didn't
do
it
at
all,
it
was
somebody
else
who
did
it.
that
i
was
drunk
at
the
time
and
this
felt
like
playing
the
game
and
came
in
the
police
headquarters
and
confessed,
i
say
the
prosecution
is
stuck
with
that
testimony.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
in
his
own
--
well,
certainly
whether
if
it
is
his
hand
writing
or
not.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
i
had
a
man
who
once
told
me
that
he
committed
such
a
crime
and
it
turned
out
that
legally
he
haven't.
he
didn't
know
whether
he
had
done
it
or
not.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
i
wouldn't
because
we
don't
know
why
he
is
on
television.
we
don't
know
whether
he
is
confessed
under
pressure.
we
don't
know
whether
he
may
have
realized.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
as
evidence
of
the
truth
of
the
fact
asserted.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
is
the
traditional
rule
as
the
eighth
circuit
has
said,
that
rule
has
stood
the
test
of
time
and
the
academic
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
not
against
the
man
himself
now,
this
is
against
another
defendant
you
are
talking
about.
we're
not
talking
about
the
confession
of
the
man
who
shot
the
woman,
we
are
talking
about
a
confession
of
one
man
that
implicates
the
other
fellow
who
is
on
trial.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
to
as
a
what?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
again,
this
is
a
statement
about
somebody
else.
not
about
himself?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
not
as
affirmative
proof
of
guilt
against
the
other
party
if
that's
not
the
story
he
gives
to
trial.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but
--
no,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
is
a
total
lack
of
evidence
of
guilt
itself
other
than
these
two
statements.
there
were
circumstances
which
could
be
said
to,
if
believed
corroborates
some
aspects
of
it
but
i
think
everyone
would
agree
that
we
took
these
two
statements
probably
there
would
not
be
enough
evidence
involved.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir,
i
do
not
base
it
on
whether
there
is
enough
evidence
or
not.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
you
look
at
each
statement
itself
whether
or
not
it
is
enough
to
convict,
whether
or
not.
and
you
judge
it
as
to
whether
the
statement
was
made
in
court
where
the
defendant
in
the
trier
of
fact
can
judge
it
or
whether
it
was
made
on
some
other
occasion.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
you
could
use
extrinsic
proof
of
some
kind
but
you
cannot
use
the
man's
own
prior
inconsistent
statements,
that's
what
you
can't
--
that's
the
great
innovation
in
this
california
code.
this
type
of
evidence
has
traditionally
been
used
to
impeach
a
witness.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but
not
obviously
for
the
truth
of
what's
in
it
and
for
all
of
these
various
obvious
reasons,
the
dangers
are
just
too
great.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
would
where
it
meant
the
test.
that
is
the
test
both
of
surprise
and
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
i
don't
think
we
can
decide
the
constitutional
question
on
the
basis
that
the
jury
will
disregard
the
instructions.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
co-conspirator
exception
only
allows
the
statement
in
to
impeach
the
particular
defendant
against
to
whom
it
comes
and
it
is
not
allowed
as
affirmative
evidence
of
guilt
as
to
the
other
party.
and
they
--
and
the
jury
is
so
instructed
but
this
court
as
you
know
has
difficulty
in
cases
where
they
felt
that
it
could
be
considered
and
you
have
reverse
cases
where
a
statement
has
come
in
that
implicated
the
second
defendant
and
you
felt
that
the
jury
instruction
was
not
sufficient.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i'm
saying
that
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
as
i
understand
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
as
i
understand
it
if
the
first
co-conspirator
has
made
a
pretrial
statement,
and
it
then
comes
in
as
to
him
but
that
if
it
implicates
the
other
co-defendant,
the
jury
must
be
instructed
that
it
--
unless
he
is
testifying
the
same
thing
at
trial,
in
other
words
if
it's
an
out
of
trial
statement
that
can't
be
used
against
him.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
i
fortunately
do
not
have.
the
last
point
that
i'd
like
to
make
is
simply
that
we
are
going
to
have
all
kinds
of
conflicts
developed
between
the
various
goals
that
we
seek
in
our
criminal
justice
system
if
we
allow
this
kind
of
thing
to
happen.
as
i've
indicated,
the
entire
point
of
the
preliminary
hearing
for
example
is
to
get
it
as
soon
as
possible
so
that
you
can
free
man
who
are
not
guilty
and
who
shouldn't
be
held
whereas
i'm
afraid
that
retained
counsel
and
appointed
counsel
or
to
the
great
impetus
with
them,
if
this
rule
is
approved
it's
going
to
delay
that
preliminary
hearing
just
as
long
as
possible
because
it
means
that
they
are
going
to
have
to
prepare
for
it
the
same
way
they
prepare
for
trial.
they
know
they
got
to
strike
while
the
anvil
is
hot
at
that
preliminary
hearing,
every
single
experienced
trial
lawyers
against
this
academic
approach
because
they
tell
you,
it's
not
enough
just
to
have
somebody
available
for
cross
examination
days
or
weeks
later.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
even
error
in
court
to
delay
cross
examination
too
long
after
direct
examination
because
the
trial
lawyers
know
if
you
don't
get
that
man
to
change
or
track
his
testimony
as
he
makes
it.
it's
going
to
become
solidified
in
his
mind,
it's
going
to
become
solidified
in
the
juries
mind,
it's
going
to
gain
a
statute
merely
by
the
passage
of
time
and
it
is
going
to
be
too
late
to
cross
examine
that
man
at
some
later
day
about
what
he
might
have
said
long
ago.
so
trial
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
have
perhaps
misstated
but
i
was
quoting
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
was
quoting
the
--
i
was
citing
actually
the
eighth
circuit
statement
to
the
effect
the
trial
lawyers
did
not
think
that
this
was
inadequate
substitute
and
my
own
experience
in
talking
to
trail
lawyers
is
that
they
regard
late
cross
examination.
cross
examination
long
after
the
fact
as
something
that
is
totally
unacceptable
substitute
for
cross
examination
while
the
man
is
testified.
moreover
some
of
these
codes
and
propositions
that
have
been
put
forward
you
know
were
not
all
like
this
one.
mcguire
for
example
would
--
although
he
cited
this
in
support
of
this,
actually
would
restrict
it
to
written
statements
and
the
british
code
would
not
only
restrict
to
written
statements
but
would
restrict
it
to
civil
proceedings
which
is
far
different
because
there,
as
you
know,
you
have
such
a
right
of
discovery
before
trial
that
you
can
discover
all
these
facts
that
you'd
need
to
know
for
your
trial
on
a
cross
examination.
but
it's
not
true
in
criminal
cases
in
most
instances.
i
think
the
--
that
the
impetus
to
put
off
the
preliminary
hearing
as
long
as
possible
so
that
you
can
prepare
for
it,
i
think
is
going
to
be
a
very
serious
result
of
all
this.
the
california
statute
is
worried
about
the
turn
code
witness.
the
answer
to
the
turn
code
witness
is
a
speedy
trial.
it's
not
--
right
now
prosecutors
want
a
speedy
trial
because
they
want
to
get
that
evidence
and
while
it's
still
fresh
in
the
memories
in
the
minds
of
the
witnesses.
under
the
california
statute,
they
couldn't
care
less
about
a
speedy
trial.
they've
got
their
case,
they've
got
the
statement
before
officer
wade
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
they
know
they
can
go
in
and
convict
on
that.
and
i
say
that
the
answer
to
the
turn
code
witness
is
not
to
take
away
the
most
valuable
single
right
the
defendant
has
in
a
criminal
trial
and
that
is
to
confront
and
cross
examine
the
witnesses
against
him
as
the
crucial
incriminating
testimony
comes
in.
if
you
have
no
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
james.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
was
urged
before
the
california
supreme
court
and
they
reserved
judgment.
i
might
say
that
i
view
the
record
in
this
case
as
the
solicitor
general
does
but
perhaps
with
moral
arm
and
i
have
not
raised
the
issue
in
my
brief
for
this
simple
reason
that
i
was
appointed
after
the
petition
was
filed
and
granted
and
consequently
i
found
myself
bound
by
the
issues
there
presented.
but,
if
for
some
reason,
i
do
not
prevail
here,
i
would
certainly
intend
to
urge
before
the
california
supreme
court
on
remand
that
this
conviction
cannot
stand
on
such
poultry
evidence
as
we
find
in
this
case.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
even
assume
that
it
all
came
in.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
would
urge
the
rule
which
as
i
understand
it
has
not
been
decided
by
this
court
as
to
whether
a
conviction
can
stand
on
the
basis
of
hearsay
law.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
correct.
well
i
would
be
happy
to
present
the
issue
of
insufficiency
and
obtain
a
reversal
on
any
ground
that
i
can.
i'm
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor
i
think
the
confrontation
issue
is
so
square
and
is
so
surely
in
my
favor
that
i
don't
think
i
have
to
urge
that
the
court
do
that.
i
think
that
the
california
court
should
there
be
a
remand
is
fully
able
to
take
care
of
that
situation.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
you
mean
the
hearsay?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
not
at
this
time.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
hope
if
there's
a
remand
and
i'll
be
back
up
at
you
when
that
is
decided
by
the
--
if
it's
decided
adversely
by
the
california
court.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
of
course
i
can't
speak
for
the
court
but
i
would
guess
that
since
they
said
that
this
evidence
shouldn't
have
been
in
the
case
in
the
first
place
that
they
didn't
find
it
necessary
to
reach
the
question
of
what
would
have
happened
if
it
had
gotten
there.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
concede
it.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i'm
fortunate
in
having
the
case
in
which
the
facts
so
dramatically
illustrate
the
dangers
of
adopting
the
position
that
are
searched
by
the
state
by
solicitor
general.
i
would
like
to
review
those
facts
briefly
even
though
they
have
been
touched
on
before
because
of
some
very
important
facts
have
not
been
mentioned
to
you.
the
key
witness
in
this
case
and
in
fact,
the
only
witness
to
the
alleged
crime
was
a
16-year
old,
name
melvin
porter.
in
footnote
2
of
my
brief,
i
have
listed
a
series
of
comments
about
this
witness
from
the
judge
and
the
prosecutor.
and
i
think
that
the
most
kindly
and
restrained
way
of
summarizing
their
attitude
toward
him
is
to
say
that
they
considered
him
a
worthless
liar.
and
yet
it
was
he
and
he
alone
who
convicted
mr.
green.
mr.
green
at
that
time
was
24
years
old.
and
according
to
the
state,
he
gave
or
sold
some
marihuana
to
porter.
now
how
did
the
state
prove
this
case?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
think
what
i'm
going
to
demonstrate
to
you
your
honor
is
how
it
was
impossible
for
the
defendant
to
have
true
and
effective
confrontation
in
this
case.
and
i
think
i
can
develop
it
for
you
through
the
facts
and
the
situation
that
he
was
confronted
with,
how
he
was
denied
confrontation
in
the
same
senses
if
the
witness
had
not
even
been
on
the
stand
or
if
he
had
been
pleading
self
incrimination.
before,
during
and
after
the
trial
in
this
case,
this
16-year
old
made
four
separate
and
self
conflicting
statements
in
regard
to
this
crime.
the
first
one
was
after
mr.
porter
himself
had
been
arrested
and
in
an
effect
that
was
separate
from
the
one
we
have
here.
he
was
arrested
after
selling
marihuana
to
an
undercover
agent
and
he
had
been
incarcerated
for
four
days
at
the
time
he
made
this
first
statement.
the
police
officer,
officer
wade
interrogated
him
at
the
juvenile
headquarters.
now
only
the
two
of
them
were
present.
there
was
no
lawyer
either
for
the
defendant
green
or
for
the
defendant
porter.
no
witness,
no
stenographer,
just
the
two
of
them
after
this
young
boy
had
been
in
jail
for
four
days.
according
to
wade,
porter
told
him
that
some
weeks
before,
mr.
green
had
called
him
and
then
he'd
come
by
his
house
and
brought
with
him
a
bag
of
marihuana.
the
second
statement
was
made
at
the
preliminary
hearing
of
mr.
green
after
he
had
been
arrested
as
a
result
of
the
first
statement.
mr.
porter
was
still
in
custody
of
the
police,
still
in
jail.
his
case
had
not
yet
been
disposed
off.
that
hearing
was
held
only
eight
days
after
mr.
green's
arrest.
and
at
the
hearing,
porter
testified
this
time,
not
that
green
had
brought
a
bag
of
marihuana
to
this
house
but
rather
that
he
had
come
and
taken
mr.
porter
over
to
the
house
of
mr.
green's
father
and
it
showed
him
some
marihuana
behind
a
bush
and
mr.
porter
had
comeback
on
his
own
that
night
or
the
next
day
and
picked
it
up.
now
i
might
say
that
there
are
number
of
inconsistencies
between
these
first
two
statements
and
the
state
has
never
yet
attempted
to
reconcile
those
inconsistencies.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
do
think
however
though
when
you
consider
that
these
are
the
only
two
statements
that
convicted
this
man,
he
was
not
convicted
upon
any
testimony
or
trial.
he
was
convicted
on
the
basis
of
these
two
statements.
i
think
that
there
is
some
burden
on
somebody's
part
to
reconcile
the
conflicts.
we
don't
even
know
from
the
trial
judge
whether
he
relied
on
the
first
statement,
the
second
statement
or
both
statements,
we
have
no
idea.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
you
would
not
have
the
conflict
you
have
here
but
i'm
trying
to
demonstrate
that
to
go
back
as
the
state
would
do
and
say,
well
these
prior
statements
are
more
likely
to
be
true
because
they
are
earlier
in
time
doesn't
face
up
to
the
issue
that
the
two
statements
themselves
don't
coincide
one
with
the
other.
i
think
it
goes
to
the
point
about
what
kind
of
witness
is
this
and
the
necessity
for
having
him
give
his
convicting
statement
in
front
of
the
trier
of
fact
and
not
back
before
some
police
officer
or
at
some
previous
hearing.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
officer
wade
to
whom
the
first
statement
had
been
given
did
not
testify
and
no
mention
was
made
of
that
first
statement
and
therefore
porter's
attorney
had
apparently
had
no
view
of
it,
had
no
idea
that
he'd
given
a
previous
inconsistent
statement.
another
thing
about
the
preliminary
hearing
was
that
porter's
attorney
apparently
knew
nothing
about
the
lsd
that
was
going
to
develop
later
because
not
a
single
solitary
mention
of
lsd
was
made
at
that
preliminary
hearing.
now
we
go
on
to
the
third
statement.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i'm
saying
the
point
of
confront
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i'm
saying,
if
i
may
state
it
just
a
little
differently
mr.
justice
harlan
that
the
point
of
confrontation
is
to
look
the
witness
in
the
eye,
have
the
trier
of
fact
looking
in
the
eye,
not
as
he's
talking
about
some
other
statement
that
he
made
at
some
other
time
but
when
he's
talking
about
the
crime.
when
he's
saying
the
words
that
convict
this
whole
cross
examination,
the
trial
was
not
about
the
crime
and
a
cross
examination
was
--
well
now,
did
you
say
something
to
somebody
else
back
there
and
he
is
saying,
i
really
don't
--
i'm
really
not
sure,
i
can't
remember.
the
third
statement
now
was
given
a
trial.
and
at
this
point,
it's
important
to
note
that
this
young
man
was
no
longer
in
custody.
his
own
case
had
been
disposed
off.
this
is
the
first
time
now
that
he
is
out
of
the
hands
of
the
police
and
what
is
he
testified
to
now?
he
says
“well,
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
of
it,
i
took
lsd
about
20
minutes
before
mr.
green
called
me
and
i'm
not
sure
what
happened
thereafter.”
he
didn't
know
whether
mr.
green
had
come
by
his
house,
he
didn't
know
whether
if
he
came
by
the
house,
he
left
anything,
he
didn't
know
where
he
got
the
marihuana
because
he'd
been
under
the
influence
of
lsd.
it
was
less
apparent
to
the
state
that
they
could
not
convict
mr.
green
on
the
testimony
in
court.
this
was
the
only
testimony
of
this
crime.
so
what
do
they
do?
they
turn
around
and
have
the
officer
come
in
and
say,
well,
he
told
me
down
in
juvenile
headquarters,
such
and
such
and
then
they
read
to
the
witness
from
portions
about
1/4th
of
the
testimony
at
the
preliminary
hearing
including
i
might
say
about
1/4th
of
the
cross
examination.
they
read
this
testimony
to
the
witness
and
they
say,
didn't
you
say
that
at
the
preliminary
hearing?
if
you
look
on
page
7
of
my
brief,
you
will
see
in
the
footnote
his
various
replies
to
these
questions
about
what
he
had
said
before
if
there
was
ever
a
young
man
who
was
confused.
who
seemed
to
be
saying
six
different
things
at
once,
it
was
this
young
man.
but
the
best
we
can
make
out
of
all
this
testimony
was,
well,
if
i
said
it
before,
perhaps
it
was
true
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
because
of
my
condition,
i
don't
know
anything
about
the
crime.
now
because
of
these
two
sections
of
the
california
code,
these
prior
two
statements,
the
one
to
the
officer
and
the
one
at
the
preliminary
hearing
where
the
young
man,
both
arms
was
under
police
control,
those
were
the
statements
that
convicted
mr.
green.
nothing
that
was
said
at
trial
could
have
convicted
him
because
the
only
direct
evidence
at
trial
was
that
he
didn't
know
what
had
happened.
the
fourth
statement
from
this
young
man
was
made
after
trial.
and
it
was
in
a
sworn
statement
which
he
said
he
was
making
at
the
suggestion
of
his
probation
officer.
and
here
he
said,
he'd
not
gotten
the
marihuana
from
mr.
green,
he'd
gotten
it
from
the
gentleman
named
plughead
7315
that
mr.
green
was
entirely
innocent
at
the
offense
and
that
he,
mr.
porter
had
made
these
statements
because
of
police
threats
when
it
was
in
their
hands
and
because
he
was
unable
to
distinguish
between
reality
and
fantasy.
now
both
the
intermediate
appellate
court
and
the
california
supreme
court
unanimously
held
that
mr.
green
was
denied
his
right
of
confrontation.
now,
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
except
that
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
except
to
this
extent
mr.
justice
that
it
was
made
part
of
the
record
as
the
part
of
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
i
think
that
if
you
review
the
four
statements
and
see
the
incredible
inconsistencies,
i
think
to
view
any
statement
made
by
this
man
as
evidence
even
if
you
look
back
to
the
prior
too
simply
won't
wash.
this
fourth
statement
is
part
of
the
pattern
of
four
totally
inconsistencies.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
agree.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
let
me
see
if
i
understand
you.
he
gets
on
the
stand
and
he
gives
one
statement.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
then
they
attempt
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
i
think,
conceivably
that
might
be
used
solely
to
impeach
and
incidentally
i
have
some
question
even
on
that
because
in
order
at
least
in
the
federal
courts
to
impeach,
you
have
to
have
both
the
price
and
affirmative
damaging
evidence
given
for
the
other
side
which
you
don't
have
in
the
case
of
this
lsd
testimony.
but
assuming
that
you
could
use
it
only
to
impeach,
i
certainly
don't
agree
that
you
could
use
the
prior
statement
for
the
truth
of
the
facts
therein.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir,
i
certainly
don't
and
i'll
show
you
why
shortly.
now
the
state
has
a
quite
simple
argument,
i
think
deceptively
so.
and
in
some
ways
it
seems
to
have
a
certain
appeal.
they
say
quite
simply
that
so
long
as
the
witness
is
available
at
trial
so
that
the
trier
of
fact
can
look
him
in
the
eye
what
possible
harm
can
be
done
in
putting
in
these
prior
statements.
well,
the
answer
is
a
great
deal
of
harm
could
be
done.
the
right
to
confrontation
in
order
to
have
any
substance,
in
order
to
have
any
meaning
if
its
not
going
to
become
an
empty
right,
must
mean
that
there's
going
to
be
something
more
than
having
a
witness,
a
body
available
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
three
basic
ingredients
of
the
right
of
cross
confrontation
which
i
would
like
to
discuss.
all
three
of
which
were
missing
in
this
case.
the
first
one
is
perhaps
the
least
important
of
the
three
but
nevertheless
i
think
it's
a
factor.
it's
the
requirement
that
the
witness
make
the
incriminating
statement
at
the
crucial
hearing
itself
so
that
the
subjective
moral
impact
of
the
courtroom
is
brought
to
bear
on
it.
so
that
he
fully
realizes
the
importance,
a
seriousness,
the
gravity
of
the
proceeding
and
the
necessity
for
telling
the
truth.
i'm
not
going
to
elaborate
this
except
to
say
that
it's
a
very
far
crime
from
giving
the
statement
to
a
police
officer
and
juvenile
headquarters
than
it
is
from
giving
it
under
oath
before
a
judge
or
a
jury
facing
the
defendant
in
the
courtroom
itself
where
the
issue
of
innocence
or
guilt
is
going
to
be
decided.
the
second
basic
ingredient
is
viewing
the
contemporaneous
demeanor
of
that
witness.
the
concept
that
the
witness
will
make
his
incriminating
statements
in
front
of
the
trier
of
fact
so
that
the
trier
of
fact
then
and
there
as
the
words
are
said
can
determine
whether
this
man
is
telling
the
truth.
now
the
state
says
that
you
can
judge
his
demeanor
at
trial
as
he's
asked
about
his
statement.
but
is
the
demeanor
at
trial
in
any
way
comparable
to
the
demeanor
on
the
prior
occasion,
of
course
not.
porter
in
the
hands
of
the
police
implicates
green.
porter
out
of
the
hands
of
the
police
fails
to
implicate
green.
we
can
see
his
non-implicating
demeanor
at
trial
but
his
implicating
demeanor
is
lost
to
as
forever.
there's
no
way
we
can
go
back
and
pick
that
up.
the
state's
position
assumes
that
you
can
judge
at
trial
whether
or
not
the
witness
is
lying
at
trial
and
therefore
you
can
make
an
assumption
about
prior
truth
but
that's
just
as
himself.
in
this
case,
if
the
judge
at
trial
found
that
porter
was
telling
the
truth
about
taking
lsd,
it
follows
of
course
that
green's
conviction
cannot
stand
because
porter
said
that
the
effect
of
the
lsd
was
such
that
he
simply
did
not
know
the
facts
about
the
crime.
but
what
if
the
judge
at
the
trial
didn't
believe
the
story
about
lsd?
what
can
that
possibly
prove
about
the
two
prior
statements?
porter
could
have
lied
in
his
first
statement,
he
could
have
lied
in
his
second
statement,
he
could
or
he
could
have
lied
a
trial
or
all
three
occasions.
it's
not
enough
to
see
the
man's
demeanor
now,
weeks
or
months
after
those
statements
were
made.
you
got
to
be
able
to
compare
demeanors
to
see
the
demeanor
now
and
the
demeanor
then.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there's
a
very
great
danger
here.
because
i
think
that
there
is
a
tendency
to
feel
when
a
man
is
lying
at
trial.
if
he
has
made
a
prior
statement
that
is
different
to
feel
automatically
that
the
other
statement
must
be
true.
but
that
again
just
isn't
so,
in
this
case
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
your
honor.
in
the
case
of
the
dying-declaration,
you
have
two
elements
that
are
lacking
here.
one
is,
there
is
an
assumption
that
if
the
witness
were
available.
if
he
was
here
at
trial,
he
would
tell
the
same
story
that
he
told
before.
you
assume
that.
here,
that's
completely
refuted
and
rebutted
because
when
the
man
gets
on
the
stand
at
the
trial
and
you're
looking
him
in
the
eye,
he
has
a
different
story
to
tell.
the
other
thing
about
the
dying-declaration
is
that
it
has
a
very
high
degree
of
probability
of
truthfulness.
the
courts
have
always
assumed
perhaps
rightly
or
wrongly,
that
a
man
on
his
death
bed
is
going
to
tend
to
tell
the
truth.
what
element
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case
point
out
rather
dramatically
the
dangers
here.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but,
there
are
other
cases
which
pointed
out
just
as
well.
and
now
that
you've
asked
me
about
that,
let
me
turn
to
the
case
that
the
state
is
asking
you
to
overrule
today
although
you
denied
certiorari
when
it
came
up
to
you
before.
in
california
versus
johnson,
you
had
a
mother
and
a
young
daughter
testifying
before
the
grand
jury
that
the
father
had
incest
with
the
daughter.
now,
this
is
before
the
grand
jury
where
the
defendant
cannot
be
present.
his
counsel
is
not
allowed
to
be
present.
when
the
mother
and
the
daughter
got
on
the
stand
to
trial,
what
do
they
say?
the
mother
said,
i'll
tell
you
why,
who
told
that
story
because
he
beat
me
up
and
i
was
mad
at
him.
and
the
daughter
said,
i
told
the
story
because
he
found
out
i
was
a
member
of
a
sex
club
in
high
school
and
he
turned
my
name
over
to
the
us
attorney.
they
said
the
stories
just
are
not
true
and
they
convicted
that
man
on
the
basis
of
the
grand
jury
testimony.
that's
the
rule
that
the
state
is
asking
you
to
adopt.
they
say
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
and
i
incidentally
i
make
the
distinction
between
a
civil
and
criminal
proceeding
although
the
solicitor
general
doesn't.
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
i
think
the
against
interest
rule
goes
out
the
window.
i
think
that
in
a
criminal
proceeding
where
you
have
not
had
the
opportunity
for
discovery
of
the
facts
as
you
do
in
several
proceeding,
you,
the
prosecution
has
to
rest
on
the
evidence
that
it
develops
at
trial
at
least
for
the
truth.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
because
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
case
of
the
dying-declaration,
it's
not
just
a
question
of
a
probability
of
truth.
it
is
more
basic
assumption
that
if
the
man
were
here,
he'd
say
the
same
thing.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
only
for
impeachment
purposes
but
not
for
the
truth
of
what
they
say.
i
say
that
a
man
could
be
convicted
in
a
criminal
trial,
has
to
have
the
evidence
against
him
introduced
at
the
trial
where
the
person
as
he
says
the
words
can
be
looked
in
the
eye
by
the
trier
of
fact
and
he
can
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
alright,
suppose
he
testifies
and
he
says
in
truth
and
fact,
what
i
said
in
this
alleged
confession
is
simply
untrue.
it
was
extracted
out
of
me
by
force.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
except
possibly
for
impeachment
purposes
and
possibly
i
think
the
danger
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
but
not
against
the
--
not
against
the
defendant
absolutely.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
of
course
you
have
a
double
problem
in
bruton
because
you
have
as
you
recalled
a
instruction
to
the
jury,
it's
not
to
be
considered
against
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
putting
that
aside,
i
say
absolutely
that
the
prosecution
has
to
contend
itself
with
the
evidence
that
they
can
produce
before
the
trier
of
fact.
they
cannot
as
in
this
case
rely
solely
upon
evidence
that
was
developed
out
of
the
sight
in
the
trier
of
fact.
that
is
written,
spoken
words
that
the
trier
of
fact
has
not
seen
and
which
the
defendant
cannot
even
find
out
about.
how
can
this
defendant
in
this
case,
when
we
talk
about
the
right
of
cross
examination,
how
was
he
supposed
to
cross
examine
a
man
who
says
he
has
--
knows
nothing
about
the
offense
because
the
taken
lsd,
how
are
they
--
how
is
he
supposed
to
cross
examine
him
about
a
statement
made
to
a
police
officer
at
juvenile
headquarters
when
the
kid
had
been
incarcerated
for
four
days,
nothing
had
happened
at
his
trial,
only
the
two
of
them
were
present.
he
later
says
in
his
fourth
statement,
he
gave
it
partially
because
of
police
threats.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
oh
yes!
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
absolutely
because
the
right
to
confrontation
in
any
meaningful
sense
is
missing.
i
think
that
they
view
the
right
of
confrontation
the
same
way
in
a
comparable
fashion
to
the
right
to
counsel,
they
would
say
so
long
as
you
have
counsel,
that's
all
that's
necessary.
that
isn't
what
this
court
has
said.
it
says
you
have
to
have
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
if
the
counsel
sells
the
man
down
the
river,
you
have
not
had
counsel.
and
here,
it
isn't
enough
to
have
a
body
on
the
stand
that
you
can
throw
questions
at,
you
said
this
in
douglas
versus
alabama
where
you
had
the
witness
present,
available,
he
could
be
asked
questions
but
he
wasn't
answering
them
because
of
self
incrimination.
he
was
denied
effective
confrontation.
and
that's
what's
missing
here
and
that's
what
i
want
to
turn
to.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
i
can
only
say
to
you
that
the
dying-declaration
--
that
the
two
basic
underpinnings
of
the
dying-declaration
are
totally
absent
here.
and
the
only
way
the
dying-declaration
ever
gets
in,
and
it
gets
in
only
in
the
case
of
the
absolute
necessity
of
the
witness
not
being
here.
the
only
way
is
that
you
assume
that
he
would
testify
the
same
and
it
has
a
very
great
degree
of
probability
of
truth.
and
because
of
those
two
factors,
the
courts
have
leaded
in
the
past,
both
of
those
are
missing
now,
the
witness
is
present
and
he's
giving
a
different
story.
and
therefore
you
don't
assume
that
he
gives
the
same,
you
have
to
assume
the
opposite.
and
the
degree
of
probability
of
truth
is
missing.
it
can't
be
said
to
be
present
in
this
case.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
not
the
first
statement,
no
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
wanted
preliminary
hearing
was
under
oath.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
sir,
i'm
going
to
address
myself
very
shortly
to
the
proposition
that
testimony
at
a
preliminary
hearing
is
a
very
far
try,
as
this
court
has
said
from
testimony
at
trial.
and
the
right
of
cross
examination
is
quite
different
at
the
preliminary
hearing
than
it
is
here.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i'll
address
myself
to
it
now.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
for
this
reason.
in
the
first
place,
that
preliminary
hearing
is
held
as
soon
as
possible
after
arrest
and
sometimes
contemporaneously
with
the
appointment
of
counsel.
quite
often
in
the
state
courts
and
even
in
the
federal
courts,
the
first
times
that
they
appointed
attorney
sees
his
man
as
when
he
walks
in
there
to
the
preliminary
hearing
because
he
was
just
appointed.
secondly,
the
issue
at
the
preliminary
hearing
is
a
very
narrow
one.
it's
not
guilt
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt,
it's
whether
there
is
simply
enough
evidence
to
say
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
hold
the
man.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
because
sir,
in
the
first
place,
the
cross
examiner
has
not
able
to
find
the
facts.
in
this
case,
this
trial
attorney
was
retained
no
more
than
six
days
and
perhaps
less.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
was
saying
cross
examination.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
was
saying
cross
examination
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
that
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
in
the
first
place
the
--
as
i
say
the
attorney
who
is
going
to
do
the
cross
examination
simply
has
not
had
time
to
gather
the
facts
to
prepare
for
effective
cross
examination.
in
this
case
for
example,
the
attorney
knew
nothing
about
officer
wade
statement
and
he
knew
nothing
about
lsd
just
by
way
of
examining.
in
the
second
place,
the
courts
are
constantly
striving
to
keep
the
issue
at
the
preliminary
hearing
narrow.
here
in
the
district,
defendants
have
attempted
a
broad
games
cross
examination
attempting
to
use
it
for
discovery
purposes
to
all
of
the
whole
range
of
facts
surrounding
the
case
and
they
have
been
denied
that
right.
the
trial
courts
have
said,
no,
so
long
as
the
issue
is
the
very
narrow
one
of
probable
cause,
that
really
is
all
that
you
can
cross
examine
on.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
one
is
whether
this
probable
cause
to
hold
him
and
the
other
is
whether
there
is
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
those
standards
are
quite
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i'm
sorry
i
can't
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
on
the
other
hand,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
preliminary
is
to
hold
it
as
at
earliest
time
as
possible
so
that
if
you
have
a
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
here
in
the
district,
there
is
a
statute
which
requires
you
to
do
it
within
ten
days
unless
you
waive
it.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
because
the
point
if
it
is
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
they're
asking
you
for
a
rule
though
that's
going
to
apply
to
all
preliminary
hearings
regardless
of
when
they
are
held
and
what
i
am
saying
to
you
is
that
that
--
to
have
a
man
available
for
cross
examination
at
preliminary
hearing
is
simply
not
an
effective
right.
it's
simply
not
as
a
practical
matter,
you
don't
really
--
you
won't
able
to
cross
examine
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
can
only
assure
you
mr.
justice
black
that
it's
quite
different
in
many
jurisdictions
and
that
in
many
cases,
the
lawyer
at
the
preliminary
hearing
isn't
even
the
same
as
the
one
at
trial.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
i
would
still
say
that
if
you
have
a
man
who
gives
one
story
at
the
preliminary
hearing
whether
he's
been
cross
examined
for
eight
days
or
not,
and
he
gets
on
to
stand
at
trial
where
the
issue
is
entirely
different
and
gives
the
different
story
that
the
prosecution
is
stopped
with
the
story
that
the
man
tells
on
the
stand
because
the
trier
of
fact
as
to
ultimate
guilt
is
going
to
look
him
in
the
eye.
in
california,
they
can't
even
be
the
same
judge.
it's
a
different
judge
that
judge
down
at
the
preliminary
hearing
is
a
magistrate
or
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
not
the
same
man
who
is
going
to
appear
when
the
ultimate
issue
of
guilt
is
decided.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
now
i
think
that
this
is
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
think
this
case
illustrates
the
fact
that
there
may
well
have
been
enough
evidence
at
the
preliminary
hearing
for
holding
the
man
but
even
the
solicitor
general
recognizes,
when
you
start
talking
about
ultimate
proof
of
guilt
at
the
trial,
you
get
into
some
serious
difficulty,
it's
an
entirely
different
matter
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
could
think
quite
obviously
that
the
statement
made
to
officer
wade
has
all
kinds
of
problems
to
it.
some
of
which
are
less
serious
in
the
preliminary
hearing
but
what
i'm
saying
is
to
equate
the
preliminary
hearing
and
the
cross
examination
allowed
at
the
preliminary
hearing
with
the
trial
is
simply
not
realistic
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
goes
entirely
against
the
grain
of
what
this
court
has
said
when
itself
has
said
that
the
preliminary
hearing
issues
are
entirely
different.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
putting
which
person?
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
understand
the
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i've
said
to
you
sir
that
i
do
believe
that
there
is
a
difference.
and
that
i
think
the
difficulty
with
the
statement
to
officer
wade
is
a
far
more
serious
one.
but
on
the
other
hand,
it's
--
i
still
think
that
the
--
that
it
is
not
enough
to
have
a
man
at
a
preliminary
hearing
simply
cross
examined.
you
just
--
what
if
you
hold
this
way,
if
you
hold
this
way,
look
what's
going
to
happen
to
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
do
you
realize
the
fantastic
pressure
that
this
is
going
to
be
put
on
counsel
to
prepare
themselves
for
a
full
effective
cross
examination
at
that
preliminary
hearing?
you
have
said
that
counsel
has
to
be
in
a
line
up
because
it
is
a
critical
confrontation
because
not
to
have
in
present
might
derogate
from
the
man's
right
at
trial.
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
these
preliminary
hearings?
the
man
has
to
prepare
himself
fully
just
as
he
would
for
trial
because
otherwise,
he
may
miss
his
only
opportunity
to
tear
this
man's
story
down.
many
of
the
statements
of
course
are
taken
before
there
even
is
a
defendant
such
as
in
the
johnson
case
and
such
as
the
statement
to
officer
wade
here.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
at
the
preliminary
hearing
or
at
the
trial?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
think
this
case
is
the
perfect
example
why,
that
cross
examination
at
trial
in
regard
to
any
previous
statement
is
not
sufficient.
it
simply
is
not.
and
the
reason
is
that
when
you
have
this
man
at
this
trial
who
says,
look,
i
don't
know
anything
about
the
facts
because
i
was
under
the
influence
of
lsd,
you
can
talk
to
him,
tell
you
are
blue
in
the
face
about
some
prior
statement,
what
are
you
going
to
get
him
to
say
just
what
you
did
here.
read
page
7
of
my
brief
and
you
see
these
comments.
he
says
“well
i
don't
know,
i
guess
i
said
it
but
really
i
don't
--
just
don't
know
too
much
about
it.”
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
not
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
we're
getting
towards
the
truth
mr.
justice.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
if
you
mean
getting
further
toward
the
proof
from
the
statement
from
officer
wade,
i
would
agree
that
you
have
a
little
better
chance.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
what
--
the
point
i'm
making
is
what
could
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
now
have
you
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
alright,
if
you
show
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
if
you
show
that
he
is
lying
now,
what
have
you
proved
about
whether
he
was
lying
before?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
would
like
to
think
that's
precisely
what
was
shown
here
but
the
man
was
convicted
on
the
basis
to
his
prior
statements.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
judge
at
trial
mr.
justice,
how
is
he
going
to
know
the
circumstances
under
what
--
under
which
this
man
testified
at
the
preliminary
hearing?
how
is
he
going
to
see
the
fickr
of
buying
on
his
face
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
my
--
i
submit
to
you
that
it
isn't
very
much.
i
submit
to
you
that
he
has
no
opportunity
to
recreate
the
scene
as
the
man
gave
his
testimony
that
you
are
allowing
a
man
to
testify
on
one
occasion
and
use
it
under
other
circumstances,
something
that
is
never
been
done.
this
so
far
as
i
know
has
never
been
done
before.
this
rule
that
they're
asking
for
is
broadly
than
the
common
law
rule.
that
the
very
first
right
under
confrontation
even
before
the
right
to
cross
examine
was
the
right
to
have
the
witness
come
and
appear
at
the
trial
while
he
gave
his
testimony.
that
was
the
most
basic
of
all
rights.
and
i
say
it's
not
enough
to
have
him
crossing
--
cross
examine
now
about
his
prior
statement,
he
should
be
cross
examined
about
what
he
knows
about
the
crime
and
the
facts
of
the
crime.
and
here,
that
right
was
simply
denied.
this
case
was
--
this
man
was
denied,
the
effect
cross
examination
just
as
much
as
he'd
have
a
wooden
body
on
the
stand
because
this
boy
simply
could
imagine
the
questions
he
didn't
know.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
if
i
were
to
guess
and
i
confess
it's
only
a
guess,
i
would
say
that
this
boy
at
trial
really
knew
that
green
did
not
give
him
this
doubt
that
he
got
it
from
10221
and
that
he
finally
decide
it
he
better
get
him
off.
that
is
perfectly
in
conformity
with
his
four
statement
which
in
term
is
supported
by
evidence
actually
at
the
trial
and
it's
just
as
logical
to
assume
that
he
decided
the
trial
to
get
him
off
as
it
is
to
assume
that
one
of
these
prior
statements
which
conflicted
one
with
the
other
was
in
fact
true.
but
at
--
that
is
a
guess
mr.
justice
but
i
don't
think
we
should
be
guessing
about
this
kind
of
thing.
i
think
that
--
i
think
the
man
has
to
get
on
the
stand
and
give
his
story
and
lets
you
judge
him
by
the
way
he
is
giving
it
now.
so
that
when
he
gives
the
incriminating
testimony,
you're
looking
right
in
the
eye
and
you
tell
as
best
you
can,
is
it
true
or
false.
now,
i
would
like
to
pass
in
a
moment
some
remaining
to
me
to
something
which
i
think
is
extremely
important
and
that
is
i've
touched
on
it.
but
i'd
like
to
expand
on
it
a
little
bit.
i'm
concerned
if
you
approve
this
rule
about
what's
going
to
happen
to
this
problem
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
it's
inconceivable
to
me
that
if
these
statements
are
going
to
come
in
that
they
can
come
in
without
counsel
being
present
when
they
were
first
made.
and
look
what's
going
to
happen
now
to
all
of
these
pretrial
proceedings.
motions
to
suppress
evidence,
hearings
on
sanity
and
ability
to
stand
trial,
line
ups,
preliminary
hearings
and
all
the
rest
of
these
pre
trial
proceedings,
every
one
of
these
proceedings
is
going
to
be
turned
in
to
a
forum
for
the
prosecution
to
get
its
statements
down
now
to
get
its
case
put
in
and
they
couldn't
careless
about
the
trial
later.
they
couldn't
careless
whether
the
man
gets
up
and
even
says
i
never
made
this
statement
before
because
under
the
california
statute,
it's
not
even
required
that
he
admit
he
made
them.
so
that
they
could
--
that
you
realize
the
pressure
that
this
is
going
to
put
on
the
police
for
example.
they
got
a
fellow
in
tow
here
down
to
headquarters
for
four
days.
they
could
be
the
confession
out
of
him
and
he
gets
on
the
stand
and
he
says
“i
never
met
a
word
of
it,
they
beat
me
up,”
and
that
first
statement
can
be
used
to
convict.
it's
incredible.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
of
course,
of
course
your
honor
that
we
are
hopeful.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
we
are
hopeful
that
the
facts
would
come
out
and
that
he
could
show
that
he
was
beaten
up.
but
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
even
to
allow
as
a
possibility
that
a
statement
out
of
the
defendant's
presence
under
the
tow
--
the
police
could
be
used
as
the
sole
evidence
at
trial
to
convict
the
man
despite
what
he
says
at
the
trial,
i
think
that's
inconceivable
and
i
think
it
goes
directly
against
every
concept
of
the
confrontation.
you're
going
to
have
statements
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
say
that
if
goes
on
to
stand
at
trial
and
says
in
truth,
what
happened
was
this,
that
the
guy
didn't
do
it
at
all,
it
was
somebody
else
who
did
it.
that
i
was
drunk
at
the
time
and
this
felt
like
playing
the
game
and
came
in
the
police
headquarters
and
confessed,
i
say
the
prosecution
is
stuck
with
that
testimony.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
in
his
own
--
well,
certainly
whether
if
it
is
his
hand
writing
or
not.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
i
had
a
man
who
once
told
me
that
he
committed
such
a
crime
and
it
turned
out
that
legally
he
haven't.
he
didn't
know
whether
he
had
done
it
or
not.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
i
wouldn't
because
we
don't
know
why
he
is
on
television.
we
don't
know
whether
he
is
confessed
under
pressure.
we
don't
know
whether
he
may
have
realized.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
as
evidence
of
the
truth
of
the
fact
asserted.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
is
the
traditional
rule
as
the
eighth
circuit
has
said,
that
rule
has
stood
the
test
of
time
and
the
academic
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
not
against
the
man
himself
now,
this
is
against
another
defendant
you
are
talking
about.
we're
not
talking
about
the
confession
of
the
man
who
shot
the
woman,
we
are
talking
about
a
confession
of
one
man
that
implicates
the
other
fellow
who
is
on
trial.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
to
as
a
what?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
again,
this
is
a
statement
about
somebody
else.
not
about
himself?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
not
as
affirmative
proof
of
guilt
against
the
other
party
if
that's
not
the
story
he
gives
to
trial.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but
--
no,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
is
a
total
lack
of
evidence
of
guilt
itself
other
than
these
two
statements.
there
were
circumstances
which
could
be
said
to,
if
believed
corroborates
some
aspects
of
it
but
i
think
everyone
would
agree
that
we
took
these
two
statements
probably
there
would
not
be
enough
evidence
involved.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir,
i
do
not
base
it
on
whether
there
is
enough
evidence
or
not.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
you
look
at
each
statement
itself
whether
or
not
it
is
enough
to
convict,
whether
or
not.
and
you
judge
it
as
to
whether
the
statement
was
made
in
court
where
the
defendant
in
the
trier
of
fact
can
judge
it
or
whether
it
was
made
on
some
other
occasion.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
you
could
use
extrinsic
proof
of
some
kind
but
you
cannot
use
the
man's
own
prior
inconsistent
statements,
that's
what
you
can't
--
that's
the
great
innovation
in
this
california
code.
this
type
of
evidence
has
traditionally
been
used
to
impeach
a
witness.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but
not
obviously
for
the
truth
of
what's
in
it
and
for
all
of
these
various
obvious
reasons,
the
dangers
are
just
too
great.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
would
where
it
meant
the
test.
that
is
the
test
both
of
surprise
and
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
i
don't
think
we
can
decide
the
constitutional
question
on
the
basis
that
the
jury
will
disregard
the
instructions.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
co-conspirator
exception
only
allows
the
statement
in
to
impeach
the
particular
defendant
against
to
whom
it
comes
and
it
is
not
allowed
as
affirmative
evidence
of
guilt
as
to
the
other
party.
and
they
--
and
the
jury
is
so
instructed
but
this
court
as
you
know
has
difficulty
in
cases
where
they
felt
that
it
could
be
considered
and
you
have
reverse
cases
where
a
statement
has
come
in
that
implicated
the
second
defendant
and
you
felt
that
the
jury
instruction
was
not
sufficient.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i'm
saying
that
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
as
i
understand
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
as
i
understand
it
if
the
first
co-conspirator
has
made
a
pretrial
statement,
and
it
then
comes
in
as
to
him
but
that
if
it
implicates
the
other
co-defendant,
the
jury
must
be
instructed
that
it
--
unless
he
is
testifying
the
same
thing
at
trial,
in
other
words
if
it's
an
out
of
trial
statement
that
can't
be
used
against
him.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
i
fortunately
do
not
have.
the
last
point
that
i'd
like
to
make
is
simply
that
we
are
going
to
have
all
kinds
of
conflicts
developed
between
the
various
goals
that
we
seek
in
our
criminal
justice
system
if
we
allow
this
kind
of
thing
to
happen.
as
i've
indicated,
the
entire
point
of
the
preliminary
hearing
for
example
is
to
get
it
as
soon
as
possible
so
that
you
can
free
man
who
are
not
guilty
and
who
shouldn't
be
held
whereas
i'm
afraid
that
retained
counsel
and
appointed
counsel
or
to
the
great
impetus
with
them,
if
this
rule
is
approved
it's
going
to
delay
that
preliminary
hearing
just
as
long
as
possible
because
it
means
that
they
are
going
to
have
to
prepare
for
it
the
same
way
they
prepare
for
trial.
they
know
they
got
to
strike
while
the
anvil
is
hot
at
that
preliminary
hearing,
every
single
experienced
trial
lawyers
against
this
academic
approach
because
they
tell
you,
it's
not
enough
just
to
have
somebody
available
for
cross
examination
days
or
weeks
later.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
even
error
in
court
to
delay
cross
examination
too
long
after
direct
examination
because
the
trial
lawyers
know
if
you
don't
get
that
man
to
change
or
track
his
testimony
as
he
makes
it.
it's
going
to
become
solidified
in
his
mind,
it's
going
to
become
solidified
in
the
juries
mind,
it's
going
to
gain
a
statute
merely
by
the
passage
of
time
and
it
is
going
to
be
too
late
to
cross
examine
that
man
at
some
later
day
about
what
he
might
have
said
long
ago.
so
trial
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
have
perhaps
misstated
but
i
was
quoting
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
was
quoting
the
--
i
was
citing
actually
the
eighth
circuit
statement
to
the
effect
the
trial
lawyers
did
not
think
that
this
was
inadequate
substitute
and
my
own
experience
in
talking
to
trail
lawyers
is
that
they
regard
late
cross
examination.
cross
examination
long
after
the
fact
as
something
that
is
totally
unacceptable
substitute
for
cross
examination
while
the
man
is
testified.
moreover
some
of
these
codes
and
propositions
that
have
been
put
forward
you
know
were
not
all
like
this
one.
mcguire
for
example
would
--
although
he
cited
this
in
support
of
this,
actually
would
restrict
it
to
written
statements
and
the
british
code
would
not
only
restrict
to
written
statements
but
would
restrict
it
to
civil
proceedings
which
is
far
different
because
there,
as
you
know,
you
have
such
a
right
of
discovery
before
trial
that
you
can
discover
all
these
facts
that
you'd
need
to
know
for
your
trial
on
a
cross
examination.
but
it's
not
true
in
criminal
cases
in
most
instances.
i
think
the
--
that
the
impetus
to
put
off
the
preliminary
hearing
as
long
as
possible
so
that
you
can
prepare
for
it,
i
think
is
going
to
be
a
very
serious
result
of
all
this.
the
california
statute
is
worried
about
the
turn
code
witness.
the
answer
to
the
turn
code
witness
is
a
speedy
trial.
it's
not
--
right
now
prosecutors
want
a
speedy
trial
because
they
want
to
get
that
evidence
and
while
it's
still
fresh
in
the
memories
in
the
minds
of
the
witnesses.
under
the
california
statute,
they
couldn't
care
less
about
a
speedy
trial.
they've
got
their
case,
they've
got
the
statement
before
officer
wade
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
they
know
they
can
go
in
and
convict
on
that.
and
i
say
that
the
answer
to
the
turn
code
witness
is
not
to
take
away
the
most
valuable
single
right
the
defendant
has
in
a
criminal
trial
and
that
is
to
confront
and
cross
examine
the
witnesses
against
him
as
the
crucial
incriminating
testimony
comes
in.
if
you
have
no
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
