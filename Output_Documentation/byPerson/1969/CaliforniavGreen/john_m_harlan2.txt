justice
john
m.
harlan
like
here
a
first
premise,
mr.
solicitor
general
doesn't
make
any
difference
where
there
is
counsel
preliminary
hearing
or
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
confrontation
is
satisfied
by
the
presence
of
the
witness
at
trial?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
are
suggesting
this
a
thompson
louisville?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
not
suggesting
this
is
a
thompson
louisville
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
clarify
something
about
a
matter,
you're
saying
that
even
if
you
prevail
confrontation
and
the
state
prevails
confrontation,
you're
still
allowed
the
due
process
question
as
to
the
“insufficiency
of
the
evidence”?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
question
i
want
to
put
to
you.
if
you
prevail,
the
state
prevails
under
sixth
amendment
case,
do
you
think
there's
a
due
process
question
there?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
heard
you
to
say
first
of
all
and
you
started
out
in
this
due
process
business,
that
was
prefaced
on
the
theory
that
you
might
not
to
the
state,
might
not
prevail
on
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
a
diversionary
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
in
to
a
program
of
examining
state
of
records
to
see
whether
the
evidence
is
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
thought
your
proposition
was
that
hough
your
diversionary
argument
was
that
california
and
you're
uneasy
about
the
record
and
the
california
court
said
since
we
find
that
this
was
not
admissible
under
confrontation
we
don't
have
to
reach
anything,
and
therefore
you're
simply
suggesting
that
if
we
agree
on
the
confrontation
thing,
we
leave
it
off
before
the
california
court
rule
it
at
once?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
lead
the
court
or
seriously
urge
the
court
to
review
this
record
and
make
that
initial
determination
that
this
record
is
insufficient
as
that
is
by
the
standards
of
reasonable
doubt?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
am
just
putting
the
direct
question
to
you
as
to
whether
you
are
seriously
urging
the
second
proposition
on
this
court.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
alright.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you
are
really
saying
as
if
i
did,
the
argument
is
that
the
relevant
point
of
the
confrontation
is
not
confrontation
at
the
trial,
but
absence
of
confrontation
at
the
time
of
these
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
that
leads
me
to
ask
you
another
question.
supposing
you
would
have
this
7445
testimony,
and
just
a
straight
forward
contradictory
statement,
with
out
any
lsd
or
any
qualification
that
have
been
offered,
would
you
still
say
that
a
confrontation
rule
that
you
are
arguing
before
it
now
should
be
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
they
come
up
and
they
give
a
--
give
a
proof
of
black-footed
statement
the
other
way.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
matter
how
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
would
you
do
mr.
prettyman
on
that
thesis
where
the
traditional
hearsay
exception
dying-declaration,
were
the
same
arguments
that
you
are
making
now,
would
you
say
that
those
are
unconstitutional?
justice
john
m.
harlan
on
his
own
or
legal
presumptions
that
have
the
force
of
prediction
behind
it,
it
seems
to
me
that
would
suggest
it
has.
the
earlier
question
i
put
to
you
is
to
whether
or
not
your
argument
doesn't
turn
on
the
particular
facts
of
this
case
rather
than
the
general
rule
as
to
the
scope
of
the
confrontation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
would
still
stand
for
impeachment
purposes
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
tend
to
end
to
rely
on
the
jury
instruction
that
they
can't
use
with
the
truth
of
the
fact
even
though
it's
a
practical
law
or
you
probably
got
into
it
and
intended
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
that
runs
in
the
bruton.
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
you
would
a
fortiori
--(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
of
the
states
have
got
this
california
statute.
