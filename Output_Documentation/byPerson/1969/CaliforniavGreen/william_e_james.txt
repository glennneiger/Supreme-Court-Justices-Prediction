mr.
william
e.
james
mr.
chief
justice
--
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
before
this
court
on
the
petition
of
the
state
of
california
containing
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
improperly
and
incorrectly
interpreted
the
rulings
of
this
court
on
the
question
of
the
confrontation
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
that
pursuant
to
that
misinterpretation
of
the
confrontation
clause
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
held
unconstitutional
a
state
statute
that
would
have
permitted
the
admission
for
the
truth
of
the
matters
asserted
prior
inconsistent
statements
of
a
witness
who
was
present
at
trial
and
subject
to
cross
examination.
it
was
only
a
few
weeks
back
i
believe
that
this
court
had
occasion
to
view
another
aspect
of
the
confrontation
clause
and
in
illinois
versus
allen
held
there
that
a
defendant
could
deprive
himself
of
the
right
by
his
conduct
to
be
present
in
court.
the
court
emphasized
that
one
of
the
rights
included
in
the
confrontation
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment
was
the
right
to
be
present
in
court.
how
else
could
you
confront
your
accusers
and
this
court
has
been
consistent
in
holding
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
is
a
right
at
trial,
a
right
to
conduct
cross
examination
of
the
accusers,
of
the
witnesses
against
the
particular
defendant.
in
the
early
case
--
i
should
say
in
the
first
case
where
this
court
held
that
the
confrontation
clause
was
obligatory
on
that
states
pointer
versus
texas,
this
court
said
as
has
been
pointed
out
a
major
reason
underlying
the
constitutional
right
of
confrontation
is
to
give
a
defendant
charged
with
crime
an
opportunity
to
cross
examine
the
witnesses
against
him.
this
court
followed
that
with
the
case
of
barber
versus
page
emphasizing
that
the
right
to
confrontation
is
basically
a
trial
right.
it
includes
both
the
opportunity
to
cross
examine
and
the
occasion
for
the
jury
to
weigh
the
demeanor
of
the
witness.
in
a
companion
case
to
pointer,
douglas
versus
alabama,
this
court
used
these
terms.
our
cases
construing
the
clause
referring
to
the
confrontation
clause
hold
that
a
primary
interest
secured
by
it
is
a
right
of
cross
examination.
an
adequate
opportunity
for
cross
examination
may
satisfy
the
clause
even
in
the
absence
of
physical
confrontation.
in
that
particular
case,
a
defendant
douglas
had
a
co-defendant
who
was
separately
tried,
loyd.
loyd
was
convicted
and
took
an
appeal
and
at
the
trial
of
douglas,
the
prosecution
called
loyd
and
loyd
since
he
had
an
appeal
pending
decided
to
exercise
his
privilege
against
self
incrimination
and
refused
to
answer
questions
so
the
prosecutor
commenced
to
read
his
confession
which
implicated
douglas
to
him
and
the
prosecutor
asked
the
witness
loyd
at
each
sentence
if
he
had
made
this
statement
and
he
refused
to
answer
on
the
ground
of
self
incrimination
and
this
court
held
that
the
defendant
douglas
had
been
denied
the
effective
right
of
confrontation
because
he
had
no
opportunity
to
cross
examine
the
witness
who
was
exercising
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
in
bruton,
a
more
recent
case
discussing
the
aspects
of
confrontation,
this
court
said
in
reference
to
the
douglas
case,
we
held
that
douglas'
inability
to
cross
examine
loyd
denied
douglas
the
right
of
cross
examination
secured
by
the
confrontation
clause.
we
noted
that
effective
confrontation
of
loyd
was
possible
only
if
loyd
affirmed
the
statement
as
his,
however,
loyd
did
not
do
so
but
relied
on
his
privilege
to
refuse
to
answer.
now,
the
california
legislature
in
1965
adopted
the
evidence
code
of
california,
incorporating
in
that
code,
the
other
provisions
contained
relating
to
evidence
in
the
code
of
civil
procedures
and
other
codes
and
abandoned
by
the
adoption
of
that
code,
the
so-called
orthodox
view
as
to
impeachment,
the
use
of
impeaching
prior
inconsistent
statements
and
adopted
what
has
been
referred
to
as
the
academic
view,
that
is
that
prior
inconsistent
statements
of
a
witness,
present
in
court
and
subject
to
cross
examination
would
be
admissible
as
substance
of
evidence
and
they
enacted
evidence
code
section
1235
which
is
the
statute
involved
in
this
case
and
made
it
effective
in
california
on
january
1,
1967
and
the
factual
basis
upon
which
this
case
arises
involved
--
mr.
william
e.
james
yes
--
mr.
william
e.
james
yes
your
honor.
the
code
commissioners
when
the
evidence
code
was
being
considered
by
the
legislature
made
comments
and
the
comments
of
the
code
commissioners
are
contained
in
the
code.
i
believe
they
were
coded
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
also
in
our
petition
for
--
in
our
brief
filed
for
the
petitioner
herein,
the
code
commissioner's
notes
were
also
referred
to
in
the
notes
of
the
committee
for
the
adoption
of
the
rules
of
evidence
for
the
federal
courts
and
magistrates
and
there
contained
in
--
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
it
was
a
conclusion
of
the
commissioners
that
this
was
the
federal
rule
of
evidence
and
that
there
was
no
reason
why
these
statements
shouldn't
be
used
as
had
been
suggested
by
wigmore
in
his
latest
work
has
been
expressed
by
mccormick
in
his
work
on
evidence.
i
think
in
our
petitioner's
opening
brief
at
pages
36
and
37
where
we
are
discussing
the
reasons
by
the
advisory
committee
for
the
proposed
rules
of
evidence
for
the
federal
courts
and
magistrates,
they
adopted
a
portion
of
the
code
commissioner's
notes
and
has
contained
there,
it
generally
states
that
section
1235
admits
inconsistent
statements
of
witnesses
because
the
dangers
against
which
the
hearsay
rule
is
designed
to
protect
are
largely
non-existent
and
it
goes
in
continuance
and
it
concludes
by
citing
mccormick
in
his
code
and
evidence
and
then
the
advisory
committee
of
the
federal
rules,
a
committee
for
the
adoption
of
the
federal
rules
states
that
advisory
committee
finds
this
view
more
convincing
than
those
expressed
in
people
versus
johnson
which
was
a
predecessor
of
the
green
case.
moreover,
the
requirement
that
the
statement
be
inconsistent
with
the
testimony
given
assures
a
thorough
explanation
of
both
versions
of
the
witnesses
on
the
stand
and
bars,
any
general
and
indiscriminate
use
of
previously
prepared
statements.
the
commissioner's
notes
are
contained
in
a
number
of
volumes
which
preceded
the
action
by
the
state
legislature
in
adopting
the
evidence
code.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
yes.
the
section
provides
in
evidence
of
a
statement
made
by
a
witness
is
not
made
inadmissible
by
the
hearsay
rule
if
the
statement
is
inconsistent
with
his
testimony
at
the
hearing
and
is
offered
in
compliance
with
section
770
of
the
evidence
code
and
so
they
--
it
contemplates
the
presence
of
a
witness
in
court
who
is
subject
to
cross
examination
and
who's
demeanor
maybe
viewed
by
the
trier
of
fact.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
don't
know
of
any
prior
decision
of
this
court
that
it
conflicts
with.
the
cases
to
which
i've
been
referring
all
relate
to
situations
where
the
defendant
was
effectively
denied.
confrontation
by
lack
of
thorough
cross
examination
of
the
trial,
either
the
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
declarance
wasn't
there
or
he
made
himself
unavailable
by
an
exercise
of
a
privilege
or
as
in
smith
versus
illinois,
the
defendant
was
precluded
from
some
effective
interrogation.
mr.
william
e.
james
it
effectively
denied
cross
examination
to
the
defendant
and
he
wasn't
able
to
examine
the
witness
over
the
declarant
in
court
and
this
court
pointed
out
that
it
would
have
been
different
had
he
been
able
--
had
he
been
able
in
douglas
to
cross
examine
loyd
which
he
was
not.
we
submit
that
this
is
a
basic
and
fundamental
factor.
i
think
that
the
confrontation
clause
and
the
rules
of
evidence,
the
hearsay
rules
of
evidence
are
sometimes
deemed
to
be
coexistent
but
i
think
a
commentator
has
noted
that
there
are
fundamental
differences.
the
right
of
confrontation
secures
to
the
defendant
the
right
to
be
present
in
court,
to
confront
his
accusers,
to
cross
examine
those
accusers,
to
probe
into
their
story
and
to
have
the
privilege
of
having
the
accusers
in
court
subject
to
the
view,
scrutiny
of
the
triar
of
fact
and
that
is
what
the
confrontation
clause
gives.
the
rules
of
evidence
concern
themselves
with
the
reliability
of
out
of
court
statements
of
declarance
of
may
or
may
not
be
in
court
and
do
not
concern
directly
the
confrontation
right
which
was
granted
to
the
accused
in
the
green
case
and
would
be
granted
under
the
state
statute
and
we
submit,
i'm
sure
the
solicitor
will
submit
under
the
proposed
rules
for
the
federal
courts
and
magistrates.
mr.
william
e.
james
in
this
case
it
was
approved
by
the
first,
the
reading
of
a
preliminary
hearing
transcript
and
also
by
the
statement
made
to
an
officer
of
the
juvenile
court
by
the
officer
himself
who
testified
concerning
these
statement
of
the
defendant.
mr.
william
e.
james
correct.
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
mr.
william
e.
james
we
submit
that
the
reason
involvements
--
mr.
william
e.
james
under
the
rule
of
confrontation
at
least
--
mr.
william
e.
james
and
that
perhaps
judicial
policy
of
policy
of
legislature
in
adapting
one
rule
or
another
are
--
where
the
various
conflicts
arise.
judge
stone
in
the
minnesota
case
gave
very
eloquent
reasons
why
the
orthodox
rules
should
be
adopted.
mr.
william
e.
james
only
as
it
pertained
to
the
in
to
the
state
court
ruling
which
we
bound
by
at
that
time.
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
right.
at
that
time
we
had
pending
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
johnson
in
this
court
which
was
not
denied
until
january
20,
1969.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
mr.
william
e.
james
but
we
made
no
intention
of
conceding
the
issue,
we
were
bound
at
that
time
by
final
state
court
decision
which
we
were
contesting
unsuccessfully
or
heads
were
bloody
but
on
bout
at
that
time.
the
factual
context
where
this
case
arises
is
the
fact
that
a
minor
in
early
part
of
january
of
1967
came
into
possession
of
a
quantity
of
narcotics
and
marihuana
and
ultimately
and
on
january
10th
sold
it
to
an
undercover
officer.
further
investigation
including
an
arrangement
for
a
meeting
between
the
officer
and
the
defendant
green
resulted
in
green's
arrest
and
a
preliminary
hearing
which
was
held
on
february
8,
1967,
he
was
held
to
answer
and
information
was
filed
and
he
was
charged
with
violation
of
california
health
and
safety
code
section
11532
furnishing
to
a
minor
a
narcotic
and
he
came
trial
on
this
charge
on
april
5th
and
april
6
of
1967.
at
this
trial,
the
people
introduced
the
first
witness,
the
minor
himself,
one
melvin
porter
and
he
was
placed
on
the
stand
and
he
was
asked
some
questions
and
he
related
that
in
the
early
part
of
january,
some
time
between
the
first
and
the
10th
of
january
1967,
he'd
received
a
telephone
call
from
the
defendant,
the
defendant
told
him
that
he
had
some
stuff
for
him
to
sell
but
the
witness,
the
minor
witness
testified
that
he
couldn't
remember
what
happened
because
he
was
under
the
influence
of
lsd
and
at
that
point,
the
people
introduced
pursuant
to
evidence
code
section
1235,
the
portion
of
the
direct
examination
of
this
particular
witness
in
which
he
related
that
the
conversation
over
the
telephone
with
the
defendant
green
related
to
a
sale,
the
selling
by
porter
of
a
kilo
of
marihuana
and
the
testimony
was
--
preliminary
testimony
was
that
the
marihuana
came
in
29
baggies
in
a
large
shopping
bag
and
the
witness
at
the
trial,
the
minor
witness
who
was
asked
if
this
was
his
recollection
of
what
occurred
and
if
that
was
the
way
he
testified
and
if
he
believe
he
was
telling
the
truth
when
he
testified
at
the
preliminary
and
he
said
yes,
i
believe
it
to
be
at
that
time,
yes.
he
was
then
asked
how
he
came
into
possession
of
this
marihuana
which
portion
of
which
he'd
ultimately
sold
to
this
undercover
police
officer
and
he
said
that
he
couldn't
recall
who
he
got
it
from
or
where
he
found
it.
and
so
again,
the
people
pursuant
to
evidence
code
section
1235
referred
to
this
time,
the
cross
examination
of
the
minor
witness
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
when
she
acknowledged
that
the
marihuana
was
pointed
out
to
him
by
the
defending
green
who
was
apparently
at
the
defendant
green's
father's
home
and
that
after
the
defendant
had
pointed
out
to
him
the
boy
went
and
got
it
and
thereafter
consumed
part
of
it,
sold
six
or
seven
baggies
including
one
sale
to
the
undercover
officer
and
the
rest
was
supposedly
was
stolen
from
his
closet.
now,
he
was
asked
at
the
trial
concerning
this
statement
that
he
had
made,
the
testimony
that
he
had
given
at
the
preliminary
examination
and
he
was
asked
this
particular
question,
“alright,
now
with
your
recollection
refreshed,
would
you
tell
us
of
your
own
knowledge
where
did
you
get
that
bag
of
marihuana?”
and
he
said,
“well,
i
guess
i
got
it
from
his
backyard”.
it
was
inquired
who's
backyard,
he
said
“john”,
referring
to
the
defendant
and
the
question
by
the
prosecutor
at
the
trial,
“did
you
get
any
money
for
selling
this
marihuana,
the
bags
that
you
managed
to
sell?”
answer,
“yes”.
question,
“what
did
you
do
with
the
money?”
answer,
“i
gave
it
to
john
i
think”.
question,
“to
the
defendant?”
answer,
“yes
i
guess”.

appendix.
mr.
william
e.
james
this
is
testimony
he
was
giving
at
the
trial
following
the
reading
of
his
cross
examination
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
the
trial
was
on
april
5th
ands
6th.
the
preliminary
hearing
had
been
on
february
8.
thereafter,
the
people
also
put
on
the
witness
stand,
the
narcotic
juvenile
officer,
juvenile
narcotic's
officer,
officer
wade
and
they
asked
him
he
had
had
a
conversation
with
the
minor
porter
and
he
related
that
he
had
and
he
testified
that
this
conversation
took
place
on
january
31
and
that
at
this
conversation,
porter
had
told
him
that
he
had
obtained
this
marihuana
grass
or
stuff
as
he
referred
to
it
from
the
defendant
green
and
that
green
had
brought
it
over
to
his
house
and
it
consisted
of
29
wax
paper
bags
in
a
shopping
bag,
a
large
shopping
bag
and
the
witness,
this
witness
was
cross
examined
by
counsel
for
the
defendant
and
subsequently,
when
the
minor
witness
porter
was
recalled
as
part
of
the
defendant's
case
in
chief
for
further
cross
examination,
counsel
questioned
the
minor
regarding
his
statement
to
the
police
officer
and
he
was
asked
if
he
had
made
this
statement
and
then,
“do
you
recall
what
you
told
him
at
that
time?”
answer,
“umm
let's
see”.
“will
it
had
to
do
with
buying
it
from
john?”
“yes
sir,
i
mean,
i
couldn't
say
exactly
what
went
on
or
not”.
question,
“well,
do
you
remember
telling
the
officer
that
mr.
green
phoned
you
up
and
told
you
that
he
mr.
green
had
some
marihuana
and
wanted
to
bring
it
over
and
leave
it
at
your
house?”
answer,
“i
might
have
said
that,
yes”.
question,
“do
you
remember
telling
him
that
mr.
john
green
had
brought
the
marihuana
over
to
your
house
that
day,
the
day
that
you
had
the
conversation
with
mr.
green?”
answer,
“i
think,
let's
see,
yes
i
think
so”.
and
then
he
was
questioned
and
this
is
pages
59
and
60.
he
was
questioned
whether
he
believed
he
was
telling
the
truth
when
he
made
the
statement
to
the
police
officer
on
january
31
and
he
said
yes
sir.
he
was
also
asked
if
he
believed
he
was
telling
the
truth
when
he
testified
at
the
preliminary
hearing
on
february
8
and
answered
yes,
and
he
was
also
asked
if
he
was
testifying
truthfully
in
court
and
he
also
replied
in
the
affirmative.
we
submit
that
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case
with
particular
reference
to
these
facts,
it
is
clearly
demonstrated
that
this
defendant
was
not
denied
confrontation
as
been
explained
in
this
court's
opinions,
the
numerous
opinions
that
have
proceeded
since
pointer
versus
texas
have
all
pointed
out
that
there
as
in
the
particular
case,
a
lack
of
adequate
cross
examination
at
the
trial
and
he
was
on
--
not
within
one
of
the
exceptions
or
there
had
been
no
diligent
effort
made
to
secure
the
presence
of
the
defendant
in
court
to
subject
him
to
cross
--
to
get
the
witness
in
court,
the
declarant
present
in
court
to
subject
him
to
cross
examination
and
to
permit
the
trier
of
fact
to
view
him
when
he
testified
and
to
determine
whether
his
testimony
was
worth
anything.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes
your
honor.
he
was
represented
by
the
same
attorney
who
represented
him
at
the
trial.
mr.
william
e.
james
no
i
don't
but
i
think
in
this
particular
case,
it
clearly
demonstrates
that
this
man
had
the
opportunity
to
confront
the
declarant
at
the
time
the
earlier
statement
was
made
and
further
cross
examination,
the
important
aspect
of
confrontation,
the
presence
before
the
ultimate
trier
of
fact
and
he
had
that
he
had
the
attorney
and
the
attorney
did
a
good
job
in
both
questioning
the
witnesses
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
then
following
it
up
with
an
examination
of
the
minor
witness,
the
officers
and
the
other
witnesses
at
the
trial.
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
go
ahead.
mr.
william
e.
james
primarily
to
determine
whether
there
is
probable
cause
to
hold
the
defendant
to
answer.
mr.
william
e.
james
an
information
is
filed
within
a
period
of
15
days
in
the
superior
court
and
the
defendant
is
thereafter
arraigned
in
the
superior
court
and
a
date
is
set
for
trial.
mr.
william
e.
james
an
information
filed.
mr.
william
e.
james
an
accusation
filed
against
him.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
we
have
both
the
grand
jury
and
the
preliminary
hearing
in
california.
mr.
william
e.
james
this
was
not
a
grand
jury,
this
proceeded
by
information.
the
johnson
case
that
had
been
decided
earlier
and
has
been
referred
to
was
a
grand
jury
proceeding
at
which
the
witnesses
testified
under
oath
but
not
subject
to
cross
examination.
mr.
william
e.
james
the
man
would
not
be
held
to
answer
at
the
preliminary.
mr.
william
e.
james
he
would
be
released
and
the
complaint
would
be
dismissed.
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
actually,
the
grand
jury
--
mr.
william
e.
james
at
the
grand
jury
proceeding?
mr.
william
e.
james
at
the
preliminary?
oh
yes.
its
--
mr.
william
e.
james
ordinarily
not,
he
would
be
there
to
merely
cross
examine
--
mr.
william
e.
james
he
may
put
on
witnesses.
mr.
william
e.
james
he
may
put
on
witnesses,
he
ordinarily
does
not
because
the
question
there
is,
is
there
probable
cause
to
hold
the
defendant
to
answer?
if
there
is,
that
question
will
be
determined
in
the
superior
court
and
it's
a
felony.
mr.
william
e.
james
oh
yes,
he
has
a
right
to
a
lawyer
at
the
preliminary
and
in
california
would
be
furnish
a
lawyer
at
the
preliminary
hearing
if
he
was
unable
to
afford
one.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
would
submit
that
there
--
this,
that
there
should
be
a
right
to
use
this
preliminary
examination
evidence
at
a
later
time.
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
right.
mr.
william
e.
james
pardon
me.
mr.
william
e.
james
you
can
proceed
by
a
grand
jury
indictment
without
a
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
william
e.
james
not
by
information
unless
the
defendant
waives
a
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
right
your
honor.
if
i
may,
i'll
defer
right
now
to
the
solicitor
and
reserve
a
few
minutes
to
close.
mr.
william
e.
james
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
james
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
william
e.
james
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
few
moments
that
i
have
left,
i
think
i
just
wanted
to
touch
on
a
few
points.
i
think
there
is
no
fact
clearer
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
than
that
the
right
of
confrontation
is
a
trial
right.
and
if
there
is
anything
in
our
adversary
system,
it
is
the
right
of
cross
examination
by
competent
counsel.
i
believe
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out
that
if
there
are
discrepancies
in
the
story
of
a
witness,
a
prior
statement,
a
statement
in
the
court,
competent
counsel
can
probe
out
that
statement
and
determine
and
the
--
what
the
truth
is
and
the
trier
of
fact
is
an
opportunity
to
view
the
witness
as
he
is
testifying
on
the
stand.
now
this
argument
that
we've
heard
about
contemporaneous
utterances,
it
comes
i
think
from
the
supreme
court
of
california
where
they
use
the
term
contemporaneous
confrontation
which
isn't
found
in
the
sixth
amendment
as
far
as
i
know
and
it
sort
of
a
do
it
yourself
constitutional
attitude
if
there
is
to
be
any
confrontation.
the
personal
confrontation
if
at
trial
should
be
sufficient
where
the
competent
counsel
has
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
witness
to
find
out
why
he
made
a
statement
at
one
time.
why
he's
is
making
this
thing.
the
trier
of
fact
can
view
him
and
determine
wherein
lies
the
truth.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
all
that
the
constitution
requires
--
mr.
william
e.
james
well
i
believe
we
cited
a
recent
case
out
of
kentucky
whereby
judicial
decision
they
adopted
this
rule
and
this
is
also
true
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
as
far
as
i
know.
california
has
it,
i
believe
the
second
circuit
follows
it,
and
following
the
bruton
decision
and
remand
by
this
court
of
the
number
of
cases,
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
follows
it.
that
the
--
if
the
co-defendant
who
confesses
when
you
have
a
bruton
type
situation
is
present
in
court
and
takes
the
stand
and
is
subject
to
cross
examination
by
the
particular
defendant.
that
defendant
has
not
been
denied
confrontation.
and
i
think
this
was
evident
from
the
case
that
this
court
had
relating
to
confrontation
just
last
term
following
bruton
and
that
was
harrington
versus
california.
there,
there
was
four
defendants
tried
together.
harrington
was
up
on
the
appeal,
his
petition
to
this
court
contending
that
he
had
been
denied
confrontation.
there
were
three
confessing
co-defendants
whose
confessions
relating
to
the
crime
and
those
who
participated
in
the
crime
were
introduced
into
evidence.
two
of
those
confessing
co-defendants,
bozvy
and
cooper
did
not
mention
this
defendant
harrington
by
name.
they
did
not
relate
his
participation.
they
talked
about
a
white
boy
and
he
was
the
only
caucasian.
harrington
was
the
only
caucasian
who
participated
in
this
abortive
robbery
and
murder.
and
they
did
--
specifically
said,
he
did
not
have
a
gun.
this
court
held
that
applying
the
harmless
error
test
of
chapman,
there
was
bruton
error
as
to
those
two
co-defendants
confessions
but
that
it
was
harmless.
the
third
confessing
co-defendant
rowan
named
harrington,
placed
them
in
the
store
where
the
robbery
took
place
with
a
gun
in
possession
of
a
gun.
but
the
significant
thing
in
that
case
was
that
rowan
took
the
stand
and
was
subject
to
cross
examination
by
harrington's
counsel
and
we
submit
--
mr.
william
e.
james
i
don't
think
so.
if
they
would
say
that
as
to
rowan,
likewise,
his
statement
made
out
of
court
although
he
was
present
in
court
subject
to
cross
examination
would
not
be
admissible
and
it
would
be
error
of
a
bruton
type.
mr.
william
e.
james
but
it
was
an
out
of
court
statement
that
was
introduced.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
and
he
was
subject
to
cross
examination
by
harrington's
counsel.
mr.
william
e.
james
and
the
preliminary
hearing.
my
time
is
up.
i
thank
this
court
for
its
indulgence.
mr.
william
e.
james
thank
you.
mr.
william
e.
james
mr.
chief
justice
--
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
before
this
court
on
the
petition
of
the
state
of
california
containing
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
improperly
and
incorrectly
interpreted
the
rulings
of
this
court
on
the
question
of
the
confrontation
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
that
pursuant
to
that
misinterpretation
of
the
confrontation
clause
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
held
unconstitutional
a
state
statute
that
would
have
permitted
the
admission
for
the
truth
of
the
matters
asserted
prior
inconsistent
statements
of
a
witness
who
was
present
at
trial
and
subject
to
cross
examination.
it
was
only
a
few
weeks
back
i
believe
that
this
court
had
occasion
to
view
another
aspect
of
the
confrontation
clause
and
in
illinois
versus
allen
held
there
that
a
defendant
could
deprive
himself
of
the
right
by
his
conduct
to
be
present
in
court.
the
court
emphasized
that
one
of
the
rights
included
in
the
confrontation
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment
was
the
right
to
be
present
in
court.
how
else
could
you
confront
your
accusers
and
this
court
has
been
consistent
in
holding
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
is
a
right
at
trial,
a
right
to
conduct
cross
examination
of
the
accusers,
of
the
witnesses
against
the
particular
defendant.
in
the
early
case
--
i
should
say
in
the
first
case
where
this
court
held
that
the
confrontation
clause
was
obligatory
on
that
states
pointer
versus
texas,
this
court
said
as
has
been
pointed
out
a
major
reason
underlying
the
constitutional
right
of
confrontation
is
to
give
a
defendant
charged
with
crime
an
opportunity
to
cross
examine
the
witnesses
against
him.
this
court
followed
that
with
the
case
of
barber
versus
page
emphasizing
that
the
right
to
confrontation
is
basically
a
trial
right.
it
includes
both
the
opportunity
to
cross
examine
and
the
occasion
for
the
jury
to
weigh
the
demeanor
of
the
witness.
in
a
companion
case
to
pointer,
douglas
versus
alabama,
this
court
used
these
terms.
our
cases
construing
the
clause
referring
to
the
confrontation
clause
hold
that
a
primary
interest
secured
by
it
is
a
right
of
cross
examination.
an
adequate
opportunity
for
cross
examination
may
satisfy
the
clause
even
in
the
absence
of
physical
confrontation.
in
that
particular
case,
a
defendant
douglas
had
a
co-defendant
who
was
separately
tried,
loyd.
loyd
was
convicted
and
took
an
appeal
and
at
the
trial
of
douglas,
the
prosecution
called
loyd
and
loyd
since
he
had
an
appeal
pending
decided
to
exercise
his
privilege
against
self
incrimination
and
refused
to
answer
questions
so
the
prosecutor
commenced
to
read
his
confession
which
implicated
douglas
to
him
and
the
prosecutor
asked
the
witness
loyd
at
each
sentence
if
he
had
made
this
statement
and
he
refused
to
answer
on
the
ground
of
self
incrimination
and
this
court
held
that
the
defendant
douglas
had
been
denied
the
effective
right
of
confrontation
because
he
had
no
opportunity
to
cross
examine
the
witness
who
was
exercising
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
in
bruton,
a
more
recent
case
discussing
the
aspects
of
confrontation,
this
court
said
in
reference
to
the
douglas
case,
we
held
that
douglas'
inability
to
cross
examine
loyd
denied
douglas
the
right
of
cross
examination
secured
by
the
confrontation
clause.
we
noted
that
effective
confrontation
of
loyd
was
possible
only
if
loyd
affirmed
the
statement
as
his,
however,
loyd
did
not
do
so
but
relied
on
his
privilege
to
refuse
to
answer.
now,
the
california
legislature
in
1965
adopted
the
evidence
code
of
california,
incorporating
in
that
code,
the
other
provisions
contained
relating
to
evidence
in
the
code
of
civil
procedures
and
other
codes
and
abandoned
by
the
adoption
of
that
code,
the
so-called
orthodox
view
as
to
impeachment,
the
use
of
impeaching
prior
inconsistent
statements
and
adopted
what
has
been
referred
to
as
the
academic
view,
that
is
that
prior
inconsistent
statements
of
a
witness,
present
in
court
and
subject
to
cross
examination
would
be
admissible
as
substance
of
evidence
and
they
enacted
evidence
code
section
1235
which
is
the
statute
involved
in
this
case
and
made
it
effective
in
california
on
january
1,
1967
and
the
factual
basis
upon
which
this
case
arises
involved

your

the
code
commissioners
when
the
evidence
code
was
being
considered
by
the
legislature
made
comments
and
the
comments
of
the
code
commissioners
are
contained
in
the
code.
i
believe
they
were
coded
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
also
in
our
petition
for
--
in
our
brief
filed
for
the
petitioner
herein,
the
code
commissioner's
notes
were
also
referred
to
in
the
notes
of
the
committee
for
the
adoption
of
the
rules
of
evidence
for
the
federal
courts
and
magistrates
and
there
contained
in
--
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
it
was
a
conclusion
of
the
commissioners
that
this
was
the
federal
rule
of
evidence
and
that
there
was
no
reason
why
these
statements
shouldn't
be
used
as
had
been
suggested
by
wigmore
in
his
latest
work
has
been
expressed
by
mccormick
in
his
work
on
evidence.
i
think
in
our
petitioner's
opening
brief
at
pages
36
and
37
where
we
are
discussing
the
reasons
by
the
advisory
committee
for
the
proposed
rules
of
evidence
for
the
federal
courts
and
magistrates,
they
adopted
a
portion
of
the
code
commissioner's
notes
and
has
contained
there,
it
generally
states
that
section
1235
admits
inconsistent
statements
of
witnesses
because
the
dangers
against
which
the
hearsay
rule
is
designed
to
protect
are
largely
non-existent
and
it
goes
in
continuance
and
it
concludes
by
citing
mccormick
in
his
code
and
evidence
and
then
the
advisory
committee
of
the
federal
rules,
a
committee
for
the
adoption
of
the
federal
rules
states
that
advisory
committee
finds
this
view
more
convincing
than
those
expressed
in
people
versus
johnson
which
was
a
predecessor
of
the
green
case.
moreover,
the
requirement
that
the
statement
be
inconsistent
with
the
testimony
given
assures
a
thorough
explanation
of
both
versions
of
the
witnesses
on
the
stand
and
bars,
any
general
and
indiscriminate
use
of
previously
prepared
statements.
the
commissioner's
notes
are
contained
in
a
number
of
volumes
which
preceded
the
action
by
the
state
legislature
in
adopting
the
evidence
code.

mr.

the
section
provides
in

of
a

made
by
a

is
not
made
inadmissible

the
hearsay
rule

the
statement
is
inconsistent
with
his
testimony
at
the
hearing
and
is
offered
in
compliance
with
section
770
of

code

so
they

it
contemplates
the

e.
james
--
declarance
wasn't
there
or
he
made
himself
unavailable
by
an
exercise
of
a
privilege
or
as
in
smith
versus
illinois,
the
defendant
was
precluded
from
some
effective
interrogation.
mr.
william
e.
james
it
effectively
denied
cross
examination
to
the
defendant
and
he
wasn't
able
to
examine
the
witness
over
the
declarant
in
court
and
this
court
pointed
out
that
it
would
have
been
different
had
he
been
able
--
had
he
been
able
in
douglas
to
cross
examine
loyd
which
he
was
not.
we
submit
that
this
is
a
basic
and
fundamental
factor.
i
think
that
the
confrontation
clause
and
the
rules
of
evidence,
the
hearsay
rules
of
evidence
are
sometimes
deemed
to
be
coexistent
but
i
think
a
commentator
has
noted
that
there
are
fundamental
differences.
the
right
of
confrontation
secures
to
the
defendant
the
right
to
be
present
in
court,
to
confront
his
accusers,
to
cross
examine
those
accusers,
to
probe
into
their
story
and
to
have
the
privilege
of
having
the
accusers
in
court
subject
to
the
view,
scrutiny
of
the
triar
of
fact
and
that
is
what
the
confrontation
clause
gives.
the
rules
of
evidence
concern
themselves
with
the
reliability
of
out
of
court
statements
of
declarance
of
may
or
may
not
be
in
court
and
do
not
concern
directly
the
confrontation
right
which
was
granted
to
the
accused
in
the
green
case
and
would
be
granted
under
the
state
statute
and
we
submit,
i'm
sure
the
solicitor
will
submit
under
the
proposed
rules
for
the
federal
courts
and
magistrates.
mr.
william
e.
james
in
this
case
it
was
approved
by
the
first,
the
reading
of
a
preliminary
hearing
transcript
and
also
by
the
statement
made
to
an
officer
of
the
juvenile
court
by
the
officer
himself
who
testified
concerning
these
statement
of
the
defendant.
mr.
william
e.
james
correct.
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
mr.
william
e.
james
we
submit
that
the
reason
involvements
--
mr.
william
e.
james
under
the
rule
of
confrontation
at
least
--
mr.
william
e.
james
and
that
perhaps
judicial
policy
of
policy
of
legislature
in
adapting
one
rule
or
another
are
--
where
the
various
conflicts
arise.
judge
stone
in
the
minnesota
case
gave
very
eloquent
reasons
why
the
orthodox
rules
should
be
adopted.
mr.
william
e.
james
only
as
it
pertained
to
the
in
to
the
state
court
ruling
which
we
bound
by
at
that
time.
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
right.
at
that
time
we
had
pending
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
johnson
in
this
court
which
was
not
denied
until
january
20,
1969.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
mr.
william
e.
james
but
we
made
no
intention
of
conceding
the
issue,
we
were
bound
at
that
time
by
final
state
court
decision
which
we
were
contesting
unsuccessfully
or
heads
were
bloody
but
on
bout
at
that
time.
the
factual
context
where
this
case
arises
is
the
fact
that
a
minor
in
early
part
of
january
of
1967
came
into
possession
of
a
quantity
of
narcotics
and
marihuana
and
ultimately
and
on
january
10th
sold
it
to
an
undercover
officer.
further
investigation
including
an
arrangement
for
a
meeting
between
the
officer
and
the
defendant
green
resulted
in
green's
arrest
and
a
preliminary
hearing
which
was
held
on
february
8,
1967,
he
was
held
to
answer
and
information
was
filed
and
he
was
charged
with
violation
of
california
health
and
safety
code
section
11532
furnishing
to
a
minor
a
narcotic
and
he
came
trial
on
this
charge
on
april
5th
and
april
6
of
1967.
at
this
trial,
the
people
introduced
the
first
witness,
the
minor
himself,
one
melvin
porter
and
he
was
placed
on
the
stand
and
he
was
asked
some
questions
and
he
related
that
in
the
early
part
of
january,
some
time
between
the
first
and
the
10th
of
january
1967,
he'd
received
a
telephone
call
from
the
defendant,
the
defendant
told
him
that
he
had
some
stuff
for
him
to
sell
but
the
witness,
the
minor
witness
testified
that
he
couldn't
remember
what
happened
because
he
was
under
the
influence
of
lsd
and
at
that
point,
the
people
introduced
pursuant
to
evidence
code
section
1235,
the
portion
of
the
direct
examination
of
this
particular
witness
in
which
he
related
that
the
conversation
over
the
telephone
with
the
defendant
green
related
to
a
sale,
the
selling
by
porter
of
a
kilo
of
marihuana
and
the
testimony
was
--
preliminary
testimony
was
that
the
marihuana
came
in
29
baggies
in
a
large
shopping
bag
and
the
witness
at
the
trial,
the
minor
witness
who
was
asked
if
this
was
his
recollection
of
what
occurred
and
if
that
was
the
way
he
testified
and
if
he
believe
he
was
telling
the
truth
when
he
testified
at
the
preliminary
and
he
said
yes,
i
believe
it
to
be
at
that
time,
yes.
he
was
then
asked
how
he
came
into
possession
of
this
marihuana
which
portion
of
which
he'd
ultimately
sold
to
this
undercover
police
officer
and
he
said
that
he
couldn't
recall
who
he
got
it
from
or
where
he
found
it.
and
so
again,
the
people
pursuant
to
evidence
code
section
1235
referred
to
this
time,
the
cross
examination
of
the
minor
witness
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
when
she
acknowledged
that
the
marihuana
was
pointed
out
to
him
by
the
defending
green
who
was
apparently
at
the
defendant
green's
father's
home
and
that
after
the
defendant
had
pointed
out
to
him
the
boy
went
and
got
it
and
thereafter
consumed
part
of
it,
sold
six
or
seven
baggies
including
one
sale
to
the
undercover
officer
and
the
rest
was
supposedly
was
stolen
from
his
closet.
now,
he
was
asked
at
the
trial
concerning
this
statement
that
he
had
made,
the
testimony
that
he
had
given
at
the
preliminary
examination
and
he
was
asked
this
particular
question,
“alright,
now
with
your
recollection
refreshed,
would
you
tell
us
of
your
own
knowledge
where
did
you
get
that
bag
of
marihuana?”
and
he
said,
“well,
i
guess
i
got
it
from
his
backyard”.
it
was
inquired
who's
backyard,
he
said
“john”,
referring
to
the
defendant
and
the
question
by
the
prosecutor
at
the
trial,
“did
you
get
any
money
for
selling
this
marihuana,
the
bags
that
you
managed
to
sell?”
answer,
“yes”.
question,
“what
did
you
do
with
the
money?”
answer,
“i
gave
it
to
john
i
think”.
question,
“to
the
defendant?”
answer,
“yes
i
guess”.
this

of
the
appendix.
mr.
william
e.
james
this
is
testimony
he
was
giving
at
the
trial
following
the
reading
of
his
cross
examination
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
the
trial
was
on
april
5th
ands
6th.
the
preliminary
hearing
had
been
on
february
8.
thereafter,
the
people
also
put
on
the
witness
stand,
the
narcotic
juvenile
officer,
juvenile
narcotic's
officer,
officer
wade
and
they
asked
him
he
had
had
a
conversation
with
the
minor
porter
and
he
related
that
he
had
and
he
testified
that
this
conversation
took
place
on
january
31
and
that
at
this
conversation,
porter
had
told
him
that
he
had
obtained
this
marihuana
grass
or
stuff
as
he
referred
to
it
from
the
defendant
green
and
that
green
had
brought
it
over
to
his
house
and
it
consisted
of
29
wax
paper
bags
in
a
shopping
bag,
a
large
shopping
bag
and
the
witness,
this
witness
was
cross
examined
by
counsel
for
the
defendant
and
subsequently,
when
the
minor
witness
porter
was
recalled
as
part
of
the
defendant's
case
in
chief
for
further
cross
examination,
counsel
questioned
the
minor
regarding
his
statement
to
the
police
officer
and
he
was
asked
if
he
had
made
this
statement
and
then,
“do
you
recall
what
you
told
him
at
that
time?”
answer,
“umm
let's
see”.
“will
it
had
to
do
with
buying
it
from
john?”
“yes
sir,
i
mean,
i
couldn't
say
exactly
what
went
on
or
not”.
question,
“well,
do
you
remember
telling
the
officer
that
mr.
green
phoned
you
up
and
told
you
that
he
mr.
green
had
some
marihuana
and
wanted
to
bring
it
over
and
leave
it
at
your
house?”
answer,
“i
might
have
said
that,
yes”.
question,
“do
you
remember
telling
him
that
mr.
john
green
had
brought
the
marihuana
over
to
your
house
that
day,
the
day
that
you
had
the
conversation
with
mr.
green?”
answer,
“i
think,
let's
see,
yes
i
think
so”.
and
then
he
was
questioned
and
this
is
pages
59
and
60.
he
was
questioned
whether
he
believed
he
was
telling
the
truth
when
he
made
the
statement
to
the
police
officer
on
january
31
and
he
said
yes
sir.
he
was
also
asked
if
he
believed
he
was
telling
the
truth
when
he
testified
at
the
preliminary
hearing
on
february
8
and
answered
yes,
and
he
was
also
asked
if
he
was
testifying
truthfully
in
court
and
he
also
replied
in
the
affirmative.
we
submit
that
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case
with
particular
reference
to
these
facts,
it
is
clearly
demonstrated
that
this
defendant
was
not
denied
confrontation
as
been
explained
in
this
court's
opinions,
the
numerous
opinions
that
have
proceeded
since
pointer
versus
texas
have
all
pointed
out
that
there
as
in
the
particular
case,
a
lack
of
adequate
cross
examination
at
the
trial
and
he
was
on
--
not
within
one
of
the
exceptions
or
there
had
been
no
diligent
effort
made
to
secure
the
presence
of
the
defendant
in
court
to
subject
him
to
cross
--
to
get
the
witness
in
court,
the
declarant
present
in
court
to
subject
him
to
cross
examination
and
to
permit
the
trier
of
fact
to
view
him
when
he
testified
and
to
determine
whether
his
testimony
was
worth
anything.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes
your
honor.
he
was
represented
by
the
same
attorney
who
represented
him
at
the
trial.
mr.
william
e.
james
no
i
don't
but
i
think
in
this
particular
case,
it
clearly
demonstrates
that
this
man
had
the
opportunity
to
confront
the
declarant
at
the
time
the
earlier
statement
was
made
and
further
cross
examination,
the
important
aspect
of
confrontation,
the
presence
before
the
ultimate
trier
of
fact
and
he
had
that
he
had
the
attorney
and
the
attorney
did
a
good
job
in
both
questioning
the
witnesses
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
then
following
it
up
with
an
examination
of
the
minor
witness,
the
officers
and
the
other
witnesses
at
the
trial.
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
go
ahead.
mr.
william
e.
james
primarily
to
determine
whether
there
is
probable
cause
to
hold
the
defendant
to
answer.
mr.
william
e.
james
an
information
is
filed
within
a
period
of
15
days
in
the
superior
court
and
the
defendant
is
thereafter
arraigned
in
the
superior
court
and
a
date
is
set
for
trial.
mr.
william
e.
james
an
information
filed.
mr.
william
e.
james
an
accusation
filed
against
him.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
we
have
both
the
grand
jury
and
the
preliminary
hearing
in
california.
mr.
william
e.
james
this
was
not
a
grand
jury,
this
proceeded
by
information.
the
johnson
case
that
had
been
decided
earlier
and
has
been
referred
to
was
a
grand
jury
proceeding
at
which
the
witnesses
testified
under
oath
but
not
subject
to
cross
examination.
mr.
william
e.
james
the
man
would
not
be
held
to
answer
at
the
preliminary.
mr.
william
e.
james
he
would
be
released
and
the
complaint
would
be
dismissed.
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
actually,
the
grand
jury
--
mr.
william
e.
james
at
the
grand
jury
proceeding?
mr.
william
e.
james
at
the
preliminary?
oh
yes.
its
--
mr.
william
e.
james
ordinarily
not,
he
would
be
there
to
merely
cross
examine
--
mr.
william
e.
james
he
may
put
on
witnesses.
mr.
william
e.
james
he
may
put
on
witnesses,
he
ordinarily
does
not
because
the
question
there
is,
is
there
probable
cause
to
hold
the
defendant
to
answer?
if
there
is,
that
question
will
be
determined
in
the
superior
court
and
it's
a
felony.
mr.
william
e.
james
oh
yes,
he
has
a
right
to
a
lawyer
at
the
preliminary
and
in
california
would
be
furnish
a
lawyer
at
the
preliminary
hearing
if
he
was
unable
to
afford
one.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
would
submit
that
there
--
this,
that
there
should
be
a
right
to
use
this
preliminary
examination
evidence
at
a
later
time.
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
right.
mr.
william
e.
james
pardon
me.
mr.
william
e.
james
you
can
proceed
by
a
grand
jury
indictment
without
a
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
william
e.
james
not
by
information
unless
the
defendant
waives
a
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
right
your
honor.
if
i
may,
i'll
defer
right
now
to
the
solicitor
and
reserve
a
few
minutes
to
close.
mr.
william
e.
james
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
james
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
william
e.
james
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
few
moments
that
i
have
left,
i
think
i
just
wanted
to
touch
on
a
few
points.
i
think
there
is
no
fact
clearer
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
than
that
the
right
of
confrontation
is
a
trial
right.
and
if
there
is
anything
in
our
adversary
system,
it
is
the
right
of
cross
examination
by
competent
counsel.
i
believe
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out
that
if
there
are
discrepancies
in
the
story
of
a
witness,
a
prior
statement,
a
statement
in
the
court,
competent
counsel
can
probe
out
that
statement
and
determine
and
the
--
what
the
truth
is
and
the
trier
of
fact
is
an
opportunity
to
view
the
witness
as
he
is
testifying
on
the
stand.
now
this
argument
that
we've
heard
about
contemporaneous
utterances,
it
comes
i
think
from
the
supreme
court
of
california
where
they
use
the
term
contemporaneous
confrontation
which
isn't
found
in
the
sixth
amendment
as
far
as
i
know
and
it
sort
of
a
do
it
yourself
constitutional
attitude
if
there
is
to
be
any
confrontation.
the
personal
confrontation
if
at
trial
should
be
sufficient
where
the
competent
counsel
has
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
witness
to
find
out
why
he
made
a
statement
at
one
time.
why
he's
is
making
this
thing.
the
trier
of
fact
can
view
him
and
determine
wherein
lies
the
truth.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
all
that
the
constitution
requires
--
mr.
william
e.
james
well
i
believe
we
cited
a
recent
case
out
of
kentucky
whereby
judicial
decision
they
adopted
this
rule
and
this
is
also
true
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
as
far
as
i
know.
california
has
it,
i
believe
the
second
circuit
follows
it,
and
following
the
bruton
decision
and
remand
by
this
court
of
the
number
of
cases,
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
follows
it.
that
the
--
if
the
co-defendant
who
confesses
when
you
have
a
bruton
type
situation
is
present
in
court
and
takes
the
stand
and
is
subject
to
cross
examination
by
the
particular
defendant.
that
defendant
has
not
been
denied
confrontation.
and
i
think
this
was
evident
from
the
case
that
this
court
had
relating
to
confrontation
just
last
term
following
bruton
and
that
was
harrington
versus
california.
there,
there
was
four
defendants
tried
together.
harrington
was
up
on
the
appeal,
his
petition
to
this
court
contending
that
he
had
been
denied
confrontation.
there
were
three
confessing
co-defendants
whose
confessions
relating
to
the
crime
and
those
who
participated
in
the
crime
were
introduced
into
evidence.
two
of
those
confessing
co-defendants,
bozvy
and
cooper
did
not
mention
this
defendant
harrington
by
name.
they
did
not
relate
his
participation.
they
talked
about
a
white
boy
and
he
was
the
only
caucasian.
harrington
was
the
only
caucasian
who
participated
in
this
abortive
robbery
and
murder.
and
they
did
--
specifically
said,
he
did
not
have
a
gun.
this
court
held
that
applying
the
harmless
error
test
of
chapman,
there
was
bruton
error
as
to
those
two
co-defendants
confessions
but
that
it
was
harmless.
the
third
confessing
co-defendant
rowan
named
harrington,
placed
them
in
the
store
where
the
robbery
took
place
with
a
gun
in
possession
of
a
gun.
but
the
significant
thing
in
that
case
was
that
rowan
took
the
stand
and
was
subject
to
cross
examination
by
harrington's
counsel
and
we
submit
--
mr.
william
e.
james
i
don't
think
so.
if
they
would
say
that
as
to
rowan,
likewise,
his
statement
made
out
of
court
although
he
was
present
in
court
subject
to
cross
examination
would
not
be
admissible
and
it
would
be
error
of
a
bruton
type.
mr.
william
e.
james
but
it
was
an
out
of
court
statement
that
was
introduced.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
and
he
was
subject
to
cross
examination
by
harrington's
counsel.
mr.
william
e.
james
and
the
preliminary
hearing.
my
time
is
up.
i
thank
this
court
for
its
indulgence.
mr.
william
e.
james
thank
you.
