it

justice

r.

mr.
solicitor
general,
could
i
ask
you
if
you're
--
are
you
suggesting
the
rule
would
be
different
if
the
witness
denies
having
made
the
prior
statement
but
you
put
on
witnesses
to
show
that
he
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
put
on
testimony
that
showed
that
he
did
make
his
prior
statement?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
confrontation
talk?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
do
we
go
reaching
it
the
things
like
this?
i
don't
we
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
inconsistent
with
--
in
state
cases
we
don't
send
them
back
for
proceedings
consistently,
we
send
them
back
if
the
proceedings
not
inconsistent.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
make
any
or
draw
any
distinction
mr.
prettyman
in
terms
of
what
kind
of
a
statement
the
witness
made
at
the
previous
time?
what
if
the
witness
had
made
a
statement
that
was
against
his
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
just
generally,
if
there
were
--
the
prior
statements
by
the
witness
if
there
was
some
other
substitute
for
reliability,
i
take
it
like
from
the
dying-declarations,
you
would
permit
those.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
wouldn't
--
so
in
terms,
except
to
the
dying-declaration,
you
wouldn't
permit
any
of
the
exceptions
to
be
heard.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
co-defendants
tried,
one
of
the
co-defendants
has
confessed.
and
he
implicates
the
other
defendant.
and
in
bruton,
the
court
held
that
at
least
where
the
co-defendant
didn't
testify,
you
could
introduce
the
confession.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
use
it
against
the
other
defendant.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
co-defendant
does
testify?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
say
then
that
they
could
not
introduce
this
prior
confession
against
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
it
is
introduced
against
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
the
prior
statement
of
the
defendant
himself
is
an
admission
and
admissible
for
the
truth
of
the
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
put
that
aside.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
make
the
same
statement
as
whether
you
would
make
--you
would
have
the
same
position,
whether
or
not
the
man
--
the
prior
statement
was
made
under
the
influence
of
lsd,
if
you'd
been
perfectly
competent
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
knew
exactly
you
would
take
to
have
the
same
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
that
holding
stand
if
your
opponents
are
--
justice
byron
r.
white
rowan's
testimony
was
different
but
it
was
an
out
of
court
statement.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
testified,
that
certainly
was
substance
evidence
against
harrington,
he
testified
it
to
trial
against
harrington.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
we
were
dealing
with
here
is
a
testimony
at
the
trial
which
doesn't
support
the
prosecution.
and
you're
relying
on
statements
given
to
the
police
officer
for

evidence
upon
which
to
convict
green,
aren't
you?
justice
