justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
last
sentence
of
the
opinion
says
just
that.
we
need
not
reach
defendant's
additional
contentions
of
insufficiency.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
it's
wide
open.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
wide
open
if
you
will
get
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
the
testimony
under
oath?
justice
thurgood
marshall
testimony
was
under
oath?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
one
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
let's
presume
to
be
truthful.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
prettyman,
my
problem
is
simple.
the
man
testifies
at
the
preliminary
hearing
one
way,
and
that
the
hearing
on
the
merits,
he
says
i
didn't
know
what
happened
because
i
was
on
lsd,
he
keep
emphasizing
the
point
of
lack
of
effective
cross
examination.
well
ones
he
make
that
statement,
both
the
statements
read
to
him
and
the
statement
he
made,
the
defense
counsel
has
unlimited
cross
examination,
right
or
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
the
trial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
you
don't
deny
that
you're
getting
towards
the
truth.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright,
at
this
point,
i'm
not
interested
in
officer
wade.
at
this
point,
you
can
discredit
him
to
the
better
hand,
defense
counsel.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
defense
counsel
just
established
that
this
man
is
a
non-truth
telling
person.
i
got
a
better
word.
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
just
--
should
discredit
him,
should
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
should
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
firstly,
he
never
told
the
truth
since
he
was
born.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
my
point,
so
the
judge
sitting
at
the
trier
of
fact
does
not
agree
that
he
just
never
tells
the
truth.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
wouldn't
know
as
much
about
it
as
competent
counsel
brings
out
on
cross
examination
at
the
trial
on
the
merits.
it's
just
how
much
you
know?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
the
man
comes
in
to
the
police
precinct
and
says
i
just
murdered
my
brother
and
i
shot
him
with
a
38
revolver
which
i
am
now
handing
to
you
and
i'm
ready,
willing
to
sign
anything
that
you
will
give
me
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i've
written
it
up
myself.
and
he
doesn't
have
a
lawyer
or
anything
else
--
could
they
use
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
can't
use
the
oath.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
his
own
hand
writing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
keep
pushing
me,
i
want
to
have
6
witness,
would
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
will
testify
to
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
you're
not
a
good
lawyer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
was
talking
about
the
one
that
he
didn't
have
the
good
lawyer.
well,
suppose
he
goes
on
television
and
confesses,
could
he
use
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
didn't
explain
that
he
was
under
pressure
or
not,
but
i
mean
you
say,
is
no
way
it
can
be
admitted.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
a
voluntary
confession
is
never
admissible?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
do
we
do
with
the
man
that
testifies
and
he
also
has
a
taped
recordings?
justice
thurgood
marshall
tape
recording.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
about
somebody
else,
he
wouldn't
come
in.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it's
your
position
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
other
than
those
that
will
stand
up
as
proof
that
green
did
sell
the
marihuana.
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright,
what
you
want
us
to
say
is
that
where
there
is
no
evidence
other
than
these
statements,
then
the
conviction
cannot
stand.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
ones
the
witness
says,
i
don't
have
the
slightest
idea
of
what
happened
that
day
because
i
was
under
lsd
and
never
contradicts
that
statement.
you
cannot
use
anything
that
was
similar
to
these
two
statements
to
the
contrary
because
there
is
nothing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
it's
true.
justice
thurgood

well,
the
last

of
