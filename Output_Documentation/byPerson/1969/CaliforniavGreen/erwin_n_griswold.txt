mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
as
mr.
james
has
said,
there
are
two
pieces
of
evidence
involved
here
both
prior
inconsistent
statements.
first,
the
testimony
at
the
preliminary
examination
where
i
may
point
out,
there
was
confrontation
in
the
physical
sense,
that
is
the
defendant
was
himself
present
and
sought
and
saw
the
witness
who
testified
and
then
the
second
piece
of
evidence
is
the
statement
made
to
officer
wade.
both
porter,
the
witness
who
testified
at
the
preliminary
examination
and
wade,
the
officer
to
whom
the
statement
was
made
were
present
at
the
trial
and
subject
to
cross
examination.
the
testimony
at
the
preliminary
investigation
was
of
course
an
official
record.
i
think
i
may
point
out
too
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
trial
was
before
the
court
without
a
jury
because
the
defendant
had
waived
the
jury
but
we
do
not
believe
that
this
should
lead
to
any
difference
in
the
result.
there
is
a
note
by
professor
kenneth
davis
in
the
current
april
issue
of
the
harvard
law
review
making
a
contention
that
the
rule
should
be
different
in
trials
without
a
jury
and
in
trials
with
a
jury
but
i
find
hard
to
make
that
applicable
in
a
criminal
case
because
it
seems
to
me
odd
that
the
defendant's
counsel
should
be
put
to
the
choice
of
trying
to
decide
whether
we
shall
waive
a
jury
or
not
depending
upon
what
evidence
can
or
cannot
come
in.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
a
criminal
case,
the
rules
of
evidence
should
be
the
same
in
either
way.
now,
our
submission
here
is
against
the
decision
below
by
the
california
supreme
court
which
deals
in
effect
only
with
the
evidence
taken
at
the
preliminary
examination
and
it
is
also
against
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
in
california
against
johnson
decided
a
couple
of
years
ago
in
which
this
court
denied
the
state's
petition
for
certiorari
which
deals
with
a
prior
statement
like
that
made
to
officer
wade
here,
unsworn
and
not
subject
to
a
cross
examination.
we
think
that
both
decisions
are
wrong
and
that
they
are
not
required
either
by
the
constitution
or
by
decisions
of
this
court.
if
we
are
wrong
as
to
johnson
however,
we
would
urge
that
the
decision
below
with
respect
to
the
evidence
at
the
preliminary
examination
is
nevertheless
wrong
and
should
be
reversed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
it
--
our
position
is
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
at
the
trial
itself
and
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
--
all
of
those
things
go
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
but
not
to
its
admissibility
and
this
leaves
directly
to
the
first
point
of
my
argument
which
is
that
this
case
is
not
a
sixth
amendment
case.
this
case
does
not
deal
with
the
right
of
confrontation
because
the
right
of
confrontation
was
fully
vindicated
here.
the
witness
porter
was
present
and
sworn
and
subjected
to
cross
examination.
the
trier
of
the
facts
had
full
opportunity
to
see
and
hear
him,
to
observe
his
demeanor
and
to
form
a
conclusion
about
his
honesty
and
trustworthiness.
that
conclusion
might
well
have
been
that
he
was
a
devious
person
who
probably
spoke
the
truth
shortly
after
the
event
but
for
one
reason
or
another
found
it
convenient
to
be
forgetful
and
evasive
at
the
trial.
and
similarly
with
respect
to
the
other
item,
the
witness
wade
was
present,
sworn
and
subject
to
cross
examination.
he
testified
fully
and
his
personality
and
demeanor
could
be
evaluated
by
the
trier
of
the
facts.
thus,
every
objective
and
requirement
of
confrontation
was
met.
this
is
not
a
case
like
pointer
against
texas
or
douglas
against
alabama
or
more
recently
barber
against
page,
where
the
person
whose
out
of
court's
statement
was
sought
to
be
used
was
not
present
or
available
and
particularly
where
the
prosecutor
was
at
fault
in
not
having
the
declarant
available.
here,
the
key
fact
is
that
the
witnesses
were
present
at
the
trial,
were
sworn
and
were
subject
to
cross
examination,
so
that
the
defendant
had
full
opportunity
to
show
what
he
could
to
the
trier
of
the
facts
by
way
of
impeachment,
explanation,
a
contradiction
or
otherwise.
some
40
years
ago,
judge
hand
dealt
with
this
problem
in
a
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
although
this
quotation
is
not
there.
this
is
decarlo
against
the
united
state
in
six
federal
second
and
i
quote
from
judge
hand,
“he
is
present
before
the
jury
and
they
may
gather
the
truth
from
his
whole
conduct
and
bearing,
even
if
it
be
in
respect
of
contradictory
answers
he
may
have
made
at
other
times.
if
from
all
that
the
juries
see
of
the
witness,
they
conclude
that
what
he
says
now
is
not
the
truth
but
what
he
said
before,
they
are
none
the
less
deciding
from
what
they
see
in
here
of
that
person
and
in
court”.
indeed,
this
court
of
course
has
held
that
prior
statements
maybe
introduced
even
though
the
declarant
is
not
present
at
the
trial
in
cases
of
necessity.
now,
the
leading
case
is
maddox
against
the
united
states
in
its
two
separate
appearances
in
this
court
where
both
dying
declarations
and
testimony
taken
at
a
previous
trial
where
the
witness
was
now
deceased
were
held
admissible
and
the
maddox
case
was
specifically
referred
to
in
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court
as
a
decision
which
was
not
affected
by
those
decisions.
there
are
other
illustrations
as
in
the
case
of
book
entries,
ancient
documents
which
might
be
used
to
prove
title
to
land
and
a
charge
of
trespass
in
a
criminal
case
and
other
established
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rule.
in
this
situation
where
the
witnesses
were
present
and
were
cross
examined
in
court,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
case
that
is
troublesome
is
bridges
against
wixon
in
326
us.
whatever
maybe
said
about
that
case,
it
was
a
deportation
case
rather
than
a
criminal
case
but
i
don't
think
that's
of
any
particular
importance,
it
is
clearly
distinguishable.
there,
the
declarant
took
the
stand
as
here.
he
admitted
that
he
made
a
statement
as
here,
but
at
that
point,
the
two
situations
diverge.
in
the
bridges'
case,
the
witness
denied
at
the
trial
that
he
had
said
anything
in
his
statement
about
bridges'
communist
activity.
here,
the
witness
admitted
that
he
had
made
the
statement
and
testified
that
he
apparently
thought
that
it
was
the
truth
when
he
made
it,
i
don't
want
to
overstate
but
he
testified
at
the
trial
because
he
was
very
devious
but
he
specifically
admitted
that
he
had
made
both
of
the
statements
and
one
of
them
of
course
was
a
public
record.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
bridges?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
talking
about
bridges,
bridges
against
wixon,
w
i
x
o
n
in
326
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
us.
but
as
we
see
it,
the
court
need
not
reexamine
bridges
now,
it
need
say
only
that
it
is
inapplicable
in
a
case
where
as
here,
the
declarant
witness
testifies
under
oath
and
subject
to
cross
examination
that
he
made
the
statement
and
that
he
believed
it
was
true
when
he
made
it.
there
are
of
course
a
number
of
decisions
of
the
court
that
which
support
the
conclusion
that
such
evidence
is
admissible.
there
is
the
well
known
bruton
case
involving
the
use
of
a
co-defendant's
confession
in
a
joint
trial
implicating
another
defendant
where
the
court
quoted
from
the
leading
maddox
case
these
words,
hence,
effective
confrontation
of
loyd,
the
witness
who
had
made
the
statement
was
possible
only
if
loyd
affirmed
the
statement
as
his
and
here
the
witness
did
affirm
the
statement
as
his.
and
on
the
basis
of
this
passage,
this
quotation
of
maddox
in
the
bruton
opinion,
a
number
of
lower
courts
have
held
that
in
the
bruton
situation
the
confession
of
the
co-defendant
is
admissible
when
he
does
in
fact
appear
at
the
trial,
is
sworn
and
is
subject
to
cross
examination
there
and
this
court
has
several
times
denied
certiorari
from
such
decisions
and
there's
another
case
of
this
court
which
seems
relevant
and
interesting,
its
stovall
and
denno
in
388
u.s
and
it
is
not
cited
in
our
brief.
that
was
the
case
which
was
decided
on
the
same
day
as
the
wade
case
involving
minor,
and
in
the
stovall
denno
case,
the
only
witness
to
the
crime
or
a
witness
to
the
crime
was
the
wife
of
the
deceased
who
was
seriously
injured
and
was
in
the
hospital
and
the
defendant
was
taken
to
the
bedside
and
the
wife
identified
him
then
as
the
perpetrator
of
the
crime.
it
so
developed
that
the
wife
recovered
and
she
was
a
witness
at
the
trial
and
was
sworn
and
subject
to
cross
examination
and
this
court
held
that
the
evidence
of
her
prior
identification
was
admissible,
not
merely
her
testimony
at
the
trial
but
her
inclusion
in
the
trial
of
her
prior
identification
without
violation
of
the
due
process
clause.
now
i
point
that
out
because
the
court
held
that
since
wade
was
not
retroactive,
the
confrontation
clause
was
not
before
it
but
as
i
think
this
case
is
really
a
due
process
case
and
not
a
confrontation
case,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
stovall
and
denno
is
directly
in
point.
there,
the
prior
statement,
the
prior
evidence
was
consistent,
not
inconsistent
but
the
same
question
would
seem
to
me
to
be
applicable
in
determining
its
admissibility
and
of
course
in
that
case
as
in
the
sequel
to
the
bruton
case,
the
prior
statement
is
not
sworn
and
was
not
subject
to
a
cross
examination.
and
now
i
turn
to
my
second
approach
to
this
case,
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
suggesting
mr.
justice
white
that
if
we
had
that
case
then
we
would
have
to
deal
with
bridges
against
wixon
head
on
which
i
would
prefer
not
to
do
and
think
i
don't
have
to
here
or
that
that
would
be
a
harder
case.
my
own
view
would
be
that
it
ought
to
make
no
difference
that
bridges
and
wixon
was
--
that
its
application
to
this
case
at
least
wrong,
that
that
ought
to
be
a
matter
for
the
evaluation
of
the
trier
of
the
fact
that
the
trial
since
the
witnesses
performed
and
is
under
oath
at
the
trial
and
it
is
not
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
he
did
make
the
prior
statement,
that
is
correct,
but
i
feel
a
little
happier
or
quite
a
bit
happier
that
i
can
distinguish
bridges
against
wixon
rather
than
having
to
meet
it
head
on.
now,
if
in
accordance
with
our
submission,
this
is
not
a
sixth
amendment
case,
then
our
contention
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
due
process
clause
which
should
prevent
the
admission
of
the
evidence
below.
let
me
say
before
going
further
that
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
poor
case.
i'm
not
representing
the
state
of
california
here
and
mr.
james
will
speak
up
for
the
state.
there
are
no
sense
bound
by
but
what
i
say
--
but
this
court
has
recently
found
that
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
a
requirement
of
the
due
process
clause
in
criminal
cases
and
i
can
only
say
that
i
can't
find
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
this
record.
this
is
not
a
case
where
it
is
enough
to
find
some
evidence
or
sufficient
evidence
to
support
a
verdict
based
on
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
it's
a
criminal
case
where
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
required.
needless
to
say,
i
don't
think
that
this
court
should
review
records
in
state
criminal
cases
to
determine
whether
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
support
a
verdict
of
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
court
can
correct
the
error
of
the
california
supreme
court
an
error
into
which
i
think
it
maybe
said
that
the
california
court
fell
because
of
the
chilling
effect
of
certain
decisions
of
this
court
in
rejecting
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence
here
and
then
remand
the
case
to
the
california
court
for
further
proceedings,
after
all,
the
court
below
concluded
its
opinion
by
saying
on
page
118
of
the
appendix,
we
need
not
reach
the
defendant's
additional
contentions
of
insufficiency
of
the
evidence,
suppression
of
the
evidence
and
prejudicial
misconduct.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
it
seems
to
me
is
a
matter
for
the
california
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
no,
i
think
this
is
--
there
is
more
evidence
here
than
there
was
in
thompson
against
louisville
but
i
don't
think
an
my
view
is
of
no
importance
but
i
have
read
the
record
and
i
couldn't
find
that
there
was
evidence
of
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
here.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
need
be
concerned
that
justice
will
not
be
done
if
it
corrects
the
court
below
on
the
constitutional
law
of
evidence.
what
i
am
concerned
with
is
that
hard
cases
make
bad
law,
we
all
know
that
and
i
agree
that
this
is
a
hard
case
but
i
don't
think
that
it
should
be
resolved
by
a
holy
novel
and
i
should
think
unfortunate
discovery
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
thus
presumably
the
fifth
as
well
requires
that
hearsay
evidence
is
inadmissible
even
where
the
witnesses
involved
are
in
court
sworn
and
available
for
cross
examination.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
what
i
am
trying
to
say
is
a
little
bit
like
what
was
in
stovall
and
denno.
the
first
portion
of
my
argument
is
this
is
not
a
sixth
amendment
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
sixth
amendment
is
fully
satisfied
here,
there
was
every
confrontation
that
you
can
want
and
therefore,
perhaps
that's
enough
to
dispose
of
the
case
if
it
is,
what
i
have
more
to
say
is
irrelevant.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
conceivably
there
is
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
perhaps
i
would
prefer
to
put
it
this
way
mr.
justice.
if
there
is
any
question,
it
is
only
a
question
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
don't
regard
that
question
as
serious
but
i
thought
it
of
enough
concern
that
it
was
appropriate
to
devote
a
part
of
my
argument
to
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
were
talking
about
the
admission
of
prior
inconsistent
statements
as
affirmative
evidence.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
what
i
am
seeking
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice,
that's
my
personal
view
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
my
concern
here
is
that
when
the
court
reads
this
record
and
finds
that
it
is
a
pretty
thin
case
that
we
may
end
up
with
a
constitutionally
prescribed
rule
with
respect
to
the
rules
of
evidence
as
a
means
of
disposing
of
it.
when
i
think
it
opt
to
be
disposed
off
simply
on
the
narrow
ground
of
whether
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
support
a
verdict
of
guilty
as
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
that
gets
close
to
the
area
of
thompson
and
louisville
although
this
is
--
this
is
different
from
that
case
in
many
ways.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
confrontation
overtones
in
the
language
in
bridges.
this
is
quoted
in
our
--
the
passage
is
quoted
in
our
brief.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
passage
is
on
page
22
of
our
brief.
to
admit
this
prior
statement
in
bridges
said
the
court
so
to
hold
would
allow
men
to
be
convicted
on
unsworn
testimony
of
witnesses,
a
practice
which
runs
counter
to
the
notions
to
fairness
on
which
our
legal
system
is
founded.
now,
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that's
due
process
talk
i
suppose
but
perhaps
that's
the
reason
why
i
thought
it
was
relevant
to
make
a
due
process
argument
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
i
have
interjected
this
as
a
means
of
hoping
to
divert
you
from
deciding
this
case
against
the
government
on
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
a
diversionary
argument,
a
confession
in
avoidance.
what
i
am
concerned
with
is
that
we
should
not
end
up
with
this
case
by
finding
that
for
the
first
time
in
a
180
years,
it
has
been
discovered
that
the
hearsay
rules
are
embodied
in
the
constitution
on
one
ground
or
another
and
are
beyond
the
powers
of
state
legislatures
to
change,
to
innovate,
to
experiment
and
indeed
beyond
the
powers
of
people
who
formulate
federal
rules
of
evidence
which
of
course
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
not
suggesting
mr.
justice
that
you
should.
i
am
suggesting
you
should
remand
to
the
supreme
court
of
california
to
do
that
was
such
intimation
as
you
care
to
include
in
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
does
not.
it
means
that
you
decide
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
was
wrong
in
its
decision
below
and
in
the
johnson
case
that
this
is
not
a
constitutional
requirement
but
that
you
can
feel
satisfied
that
nevertheless
justice
will
be
done
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice,
i
can't
quite
say
it's
none
of
your
business
since
the
court
put
it
into
the
constitution
about
three
weeks
ago.
the
question
of
whether
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
being
a
constitutional
requirement
and
i
don't
know
that
the
court
can
completely
escape
that
though
it
can
delegate
it
quite
widely
and
expect
that
the
delegation
will
be
peacefully
honored.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
assume
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
want
mr.
justice,
my
whole
objective
is
that
when
you
read
this
record,
i
don't
think
you'll
think
the
state's
case
is
very
strong
and
i
don't
want
that
to
result
in
an
affirmance
of
the
state's
decision
which
puts
this
rule
of
evidence
into
the
constitution
and
there
are
--
there
is
another
way
which
is
to
reverse
these
decisions
below
on
the
constitutional
questions
and
remand
it
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
inconsistent.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
alright.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
exactly
mr.
justice,
that's
my
point.
now,
this
question
of
the
admissibility
of
prior
inconsistent
statements
as
evidence
is
one
which
has
been
discussed
over
a
period
of
two
generations.
it
is
sometimes
--
it
seems
to
me
denigrate
a
little
bit
by
talking
it
about
the
orthodox
rule
and
the
academic
view.
the
academic
view
for
which
we
speak
here
has
been
supported
by
some
very
great
figures.
we
ignore
who
is
one
of
our
authentic
greats
and
morgan
and
judge
weinstein
can
hardly
be
called
impractical
persons.
this
change
in
the
california
statute
section
1235
was
recommended
by
a
state
commission
in
california
which
had
a
staff
of
which
professor
james
a.
chadman
was
the
chief
reporter.
he
is
now
at
the
harvard
law
school
and
is
the
editor
carrying
out
the
current
revisions
with
more
on
evidence.
this
rule
is
supported
by
distinguished
members
of
the
bench
not
impractical
men
such
as
judge
learned
hand
whom
i've
already
quoted
and
judge
henry
friendly
who
is
cited
in
our
brief.
from
bantam
to
the
present
time,
authorities
have
agreed
that
present
hearsay
law
keeps
reliable
evidence
from
the
courtroom.
we
should
be
continued
to
be
free
to
experiment
in
this
area
by
legislation,
by
delegated
rule
making
and
by
judicial
decision.
the
area
should
not
be
frozen
into
a
constitutional
rule
by
application
of
a
constitutional
provision
which
says
nothing
about
it
and
obviously
has
no
application
to
the
problem
either
in
terms
or
in
light
of
its
history.
i
speak
of
course
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
i
earlier
contented
that
the
sixth
amendment
whether
incorporated
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
not
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
since
the
defendant
here
did
confront
both
of
the
human
witnesses
involved.
there's
no
case
in
this
court
which
requires
affirmance
of
the
court
below
either
here
or
in
its
decision
in
the
johnson
case.
on
the
contrary,
affirmance
here
is
nothing
less
than
reading
into
the
fourteenth
amendment,
a
conclusion
that
hearsay
evidence
is
always
inadmissible
for
this
evidence
cannot
come
in,
it
is
hard
to
see
how
any
extra
judicial
statements
can
be
received.
that
would
be
a
revolution
not
only
in
the
law
of
evidence
but
in
constitutional
law
and
if
the
court
thinks
i
am
overstating,
i
can
only
say
that's
what
the
california
court
has
decided
in
both
of
these
cases.
and
moreover
since
we're
talking
about
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
not
the
sixth
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
borrow
a
little
time
form
mr.
james
with
his
permission.
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be
limited
to
criminal
cases.
it
would
apparently
apply
to
civil
cases
as
well
for
they
are
surely
subject
to
the
fourteenth
and
the
fifth
amendment.
apparently,
such
a
rule
would
apply
to
the
administrative
process
too
where
we
widely
had
statute
saying
that
the
rules
of
evidence
shall
not
apply.
such
a
conclusion
would
go
beyond
anything
that
is
needed
or
useful
or
warranted.
it
would
go
far
beyond
any
conception
of
due
process
which
is
part
of
our
tradition
or
a
concept
of
ordered
liberty.
our
law
has
always
accepted
hearsay
evidence
and
evidence
of
extra-judicial
statements
and
actions
often
without
authorized
cross
examination
under
one
or
another
of
a
great
many
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rule
and
i
would
point
out
of
course
that
other
systems
of
law
widely
admits
hearsay
evidence
subject
only
to
the
weight
to
be
attributed
to
it
and
the
scholars
in
those
systems
often
find
themselves
quite
unable
to
understand
our
concern
about
hearsay.
often,
in
one
situation
or
another
and
particularly
in
administrative
proceedings
of
one
kind
or
another,
our
law
has
specifically
provided
that
no
hearsay
rule
shall
apply
and
that
the
only
test
of
the
admissibility
of
evidence
shall
be
its
relevance
with
its
weight
under
all
of
the
circumstances
to
be
a
matter
for
the
trier
of
the
facts.
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
such
rules
are
irrational,
it
ought
not
to
be
said
that
they
are
forbidden
by
the
constitution.
if
states
wants
to
expand
the
admissibility
of
evidence
within
sound
reason,
they
should
be
free
to
do
so.
as
i've
indicated,
justice
should
be
done
in
this
case
but
not
by
distorting
our
rules
of
evidence
and
putting
it
beyond
development
and
change.
this
is
not
a
case
for
a
constitutional
decision
and
the
california
court
was
wrong
in
thinking
that
this
court's
decisions
required
it
to
dispose
off
the
case
on
federal
constitutional
grounds.
now,
that
error
should
be
corrected
and
the
case
should
then
be
remanded
to
the
california
court
for
further
proceedings
are
not
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decision.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
as
mr.
james
has
said,
there
are
two
pieces
of
evidence
involved
here
both
prior
inconsistent
statements.
first,
the
testimony
at
the
preliminary
examination
where
i
may
point
out,
there
was
confrontation
in
the
physical
sense,
that
is
the
defendant
was
himself
present
and
sought
and
saw
the
witness
who
testified
and
then
the
second
piece
of
evidence
is
the
statement
made
to
officer
wade.
both
porter,
the
witness
who
testified
at
the
preliminary
examination
and
wade,
the
officer
to
whom
the
statement
was
made
were
present
at
the
trial
and
subject
to
cross
examination.
the
testimony
at
the
preliminary
investigation
was
of
course
an
official
record.
i
think
i
may
point
out
too
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
trial
was
before
the
court
without
a
jury
because
the
defendant
had
waived
the
jury
but
we
do
not
believe
that
this
should
lead
to
any
difference
in
the
result.
there
is
a
note
by
professor
kenneth
davis
in
the
current
april
issue
of
the
harvard
law
review
making
a
contention
that
the
rule
should
be
different
in
trials
without
a
jury
and
in
trials
with
a
jury
but
i
find
hard
to
make
that
applicable
in
a
criminal
case
because
it
seems
to
me
odd
that
the
defendant's
counsel
should
be
put
to
the
choice
of
trying
to
decide
whether
we
shall
waive
a
jury
or
not
depending
upon
what
evidence
can
or
cannot
come
in.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
a
criminal
case,
the
rules
of
evidence
should
be
the
same
in
either
way.
now,
our
submission
here
is
against
the
decision
below
by
the
california
supreme
court
which
deals
in
effect
only
with
the
evidence
taken
at
the
preliminary
examination
and
it
is
also
against
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
in
california
against
johnson
decided
a
couple
of
years
ago
in
which
this
court
denied
the
state's
petition
for
certiorari
which
deals
with
a
prior
statement
like
that
made
to
officer
wade
here,
unsworn
and
not
subject
to
a
cross
examination.
we
think
that
both
decisions
are
wrong
and
that
they
are
not
required
either
by
the
constitution
or
by
decisions
of
this
court.
if
we
are
wrong
as
to
johnson
however,
we
would
urge
that
the
decision
below
with
respect
to
the
evidence
at
the
preliminary
examination
is
nevertheless
wrong
and
should
be
reversed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
it
--
our
position
is
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
at
the
trial
itself
and
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
--
all
of
those
things
go
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
but
not
to
its
admissibility
and
this
leaves
directly
to
the
first
point
of
my
argument
which
is
that
this
case
is
not
a
sixth
amendment
case.
this
case
does
not
deal
with
the
right
of
confrontation
because
the
right
of
confrontation
was
fully
vindicated
here.
the
witness
porter
was
present
and
sworn
and
subjected
to
cross
examination.
the
trier
of
the
facts
had
full
opportunity
to
see
and
hear
him,
to
observe
his
demeanor
and
to
form
a
conclusion
about
his
honesty
and
trustworthiness.
that
conclusion
might
well
have
been
that
he
was
a
devious
person
who
probably
spoke
the
truth
shortly
after
the
event
but
for
one
reason
or
another
found
it
convenient
to
be
forgetful
and
evasive
at
the
trial.
and
similarly
with
respect
to
the
other
item,
the
witness
wade
was
present,
sworn
and
subject
to
cross
examination.
he
testified
fully
and
his
personality
and
demeanor
could
be
evaluated
by
the
trier
of
the
facts.
thus,
every
objective
and
requirement
of
confrontation
was
met.
this
is
not
a
case
like
pointer
against
texas
or
douglas
against
alabama
or
more
recently
barber
against
page,
where
the
person
whose
out
of
court's
statement
was
sought
to
be
used
was
not
present
or
available
and
particularly
where
the
prosecutor
was
at
fault
in
not
having
the
declarant
available.
here,
the
key
fact
is
that
the
witnesses
were
present
at
the
trial,
were
sworn
and
were
subject
to
cross
examination,
so
that
the
defendant
had
full
opportunity
to
show
what
he
could
to
the
trier
of
the
facts
by
way
of
impeachment,
explanation,
a
contradiction
or
otherwise.
some
40
years
ago,
judge
hand
dealt
with
this
problem
in
a
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
although
this
quotation
is
not
there.
this
is
decarlo
against
the
united
state
in
six
federal
second
and
i
quote
from
judge
hand,
“he
is
present
before
the
jury
and
they
may
gather
the
truth
from
his
whole
conduct
and
bearing,
even
if
it
be
in
respect
of
contradictory
answers
he
may
have
made
at
other
times.
if
from
all
that
the
juries
see
of
the
witness,
they
conclude
that
what
he
says
now
is
not
the
truth
but
what
he
said
before,
they
are
none
the
less
deciding
from
what
they
see
in
here
of
that
person
and
in
court”.
indeed,
this
court
of
course
has
held
that
prior
statements
maybe
introduced
even
though
the
declarant
is
not
present
at
the
trial
in
cases
of
necessity.
now,
the
leading
case
is
maddox
against
the
united
states
in
its
two
separate
appearances
in
this
court
where
both
dying
declarations
and
testimony
taken
at
a
previous
trial
where
the
witness
was
now
deceased
were
held
admissible
and
the
maddox
case
was
specifically
referred
to
in
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court
as
a
decision
which
was
not
affected
by
those
decisions.
there
are
other
illustrations
as
in
the
case
of
book
entries,
ancient
documents
which
might
be
used
to
prove
title
to
land
and
a
charge
of
trespass
in
a
criminal
case
and
other
established
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rule.
in
this
situation
where
the
witnesses
were
present
and
were
cross
examined
in
court,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
case
that
is
troublesome
is
bridges
against
wixon
in
326
us.
whatever
maybe
said
about
that
case,
it
was
a
deportation
case
rather
than
a
criminal
case
but
i
don't
think
that's
of
any
particular
importance,
it
is
clearly
distinguishable.
there,
the
declarant
took
the
stand
as
here.
he
admitted
that
he
made
a
statement
as
here,
but
at
that
point,
the
two
situations
diverge.
in
the
bridges'
case,
the
witness
denied
at
the
trial
that
he
had
said
anything
in
his
statement
about
bridges'
communist
activity.
here,
the
witness
admitted
that
he
had
made
the
statement
and
testified
that
he
apparently
thought
that
it
was
the
truth
when
he
made
it,
i
don't
want
to
overstate
but
he
testified
at
the
trial
because
he
was
very
devious
but
he
specifically
admitted
that
he
had
made
both
of
the
statements
and
one
of
them
of
course
was
a
public
record.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
bridges?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
talking
about
bridges,
bridges
against
wixon,
w
i
x
o
n
in
326
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
us.
but
as
we
see
it,
the
court
need
not
reexamine
bridges
now,
it
need
say
only
that
it
is
inapplicable
in
a
case
where
as
here,
the
declarant
witness
testifies
under
oath
and
subject
to
cross
examination
that
he
made
the
statement
and
that
he
believed
it
was
true
when
he
made
it.
there
are
of
course
a
number
of
decisions
of
the
court
that
which
support
the
conclusion
that
such
evidence
is
admissible.
there
is
the
well
known
bruton
case
involving
the
use
of
a
co-defendant's
confession
in
a
joint
trial
implicating
another
defendant
where
the
court
quoted
from
the
leading
maddox
case
these
words,
hence,
effective
confrontation
of
loyd,
the
witness
who
had
made
the
statement
was
possible
only
if
loyd
affirmed
the
statement
as
his
and
here
the
witness
did
affirm
the
statement
as
his.
and
on
the
basis
of
this
passage,
this
quotation
of
maddox
in
the
bruton
opinion,
a
number
of
lower
courts
have
held
that
in
the
bruton
situation
the
confession
of
the
co-defendant
is
admissible
when
he
does
in
fact
appear
at
the
trial,
is
sworn
and
is
subject
to
cross
examination
there
and
this
court
has
several
times
denied
certiorari
from
such
decisions
and
there's
another
case
of
this
court
which
seems
relevant
and
interesting,
its
stovall
and
denno
in
388
u.s
and
it
is
not
cited
in
our
brief.
that
was
the
case
which
was
decided
on
the
same
day
as
the
wade
case
involving
minor,
and
in
the
stovall
denno
case,
the
only
witness
to
the
crime
or
a
witness
to
the
crime
was
the
wife
of
the
deceased
who
was
seriously
injured
and
was
in
the
hospital
and
the
defendant
was
taken
to
the
bedside
and
the
wife
identified
him
then
as
the
perpetrator
of
the
crime.
it
so
developed
that
the
wife
recovered
and
she
was
a
witness
at
the
trial
and
was
sworn
and
subject
to
cross
examination
and
this
court
held
that
the
evidence
of
her
prior
identification
was
admissible,
not
merely
her
testimony
at
the
trial
but
her
inclusion
in
the
trial
of
her
prior
identification
without
violation
of
the
due
process
clause.
now
i
point
that
out
because
the
court
held
that
since
wade
was
not
retroactive,
the
confrontation
clause
was
not
before
it
but
as
i
think
this
case
is
really
a
due
process
case
and
not
a
confrontation
case,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
stovall
and
denno
is
directly
in
point.
there,
the
prior
statement,
the
prior
evidence
was
consistent,
not
inconsistent
but
the
same
question
would
seem
to
me
to
be
applicable
in
determining
its
admissibility
and
of
course
in
that
case
as
in
the
sequel
to
the
bruton
case,
the
prior
statement
is
not
sworn
and
was
not
subject
to
a
cross
examination.
and
now
i
turn
to
my
second
approach
to
this
case,
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
suggesting
mr.
justice
white
that
if
we
had
that
case
then
we
would
have
to
deal
with
bridges
against
wixon
head
on
which
i
would
prefer
not
to
do
and
think
i
don't
have
to
here
or
that
that
would
be
a
harder
case.
my
own
view
would
be
that
it
ought
to
make
no
difference
that
bridges
and
wixon
was
--
that
its
application
to
this
case
at
least
wrong,
that
that
ought
to
be
a
matter
for
the
evaluation
of
the
trier
of
the
fact
that
the
trial
since
the
witnesses
performed
and
is
under
oath
at
the
trial
and
it
is
not
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
he
did
make
the
prior
statement,
that
is
correct,
but
i
feel
a
little
happier
or
quite
a
bit
happier
that
i
can
distinguish
bridges
against
wixon
rather
than
having
to
meet
it
head
on.
now,
if
in
accordance
with
our
submission,
this
is
not
a
sixth
amendment
case,
then
our
contention
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
due
process
clause
which
should
prevent
the
admission
of
the
evidence
below.
let
me
say
before
going
further
that
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
poor
case.
i'm
not
representing
the
state
of
california
here
and
mr.
james
will
speak
up
for
the
state.
there
are
no
sense
bound
by
but
what
i
say
--
but
this
court
has
recently
found
that
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
a
requirement
of
the
due
process
clause
in
criminal
cases
and
i
can
only
say
that
i
can't
find
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
this
record.
this
is
not
a
case
where
it
is
enough
to
find
some
evidence
or
sufficient
evidence
to
support
a
verdict
based
on
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
it's
a
criminal
case
where
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
required.
needless
to
say,
i
don't
think
that
this
court
should
review
records
in
state
criminal
cases
to
determine
whether
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
support
a
verdict
of
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
court
can
correct
the
error
of
the
california
supreme
court
an
error
into
which
i
think
it
maybe
said
that
the
california
court
fell
because
of
the
chilling
effect
of
certain
decisions
of
this
court
in
rejecting
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence
here
and
then
remand
the
case
to
the
california
court
for
further
proceedings,
after
all,
the
court
below
concluded
its
opinion
by
saying
on
page
118
of
the
appendix,
we
need
not
reach
the
defendant's
additional
contentions
of
insufficiency
of
the
evidence,
suppression
of
the
evidence
and
prejudicial
misconduct.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
it
seems
to
me
is
a
matter
for
the
california
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
no,
i
think
this
is
--
there
is
more
evidence
here
than
there
was
in
thompson
against
louisville
but
i
don't
think
an
my
view
is
of
no
importance
but
i
have
read
the
record
and
i
couldn't
find
that
there
was
evidence
of
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
here.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
need
be
concerned
that
justice
will
not
be
done
if
it
corrects
the
court
below
on
the
constitutional
law
of
evidence.
what
i
am
concerned
with
is
that
hard
cases
make
bad
law,
we
all
know
that
and
i
agree
that
this
is
a
hard
case
but
i
don't
think
that
it
should
be
resolved
by
a
holy
novel
and
i
should
think
unfortunate
discovery
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
thus
presumably
the
fifth
as
well
requires
that
hearsay
evidence
is
inadmissible
even
where
the
witnesses
involved
are
in
court
sworn
and
available
for
cross
examination.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
what
i
am
trying
to
say
is
a
little
bit
like
what
was
in
stovall
and
denno.
the
first
portion
of
my
argument
is
this
is
not
a
sixth
amendment
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
sixth
amendment
is
fully
satisfied
here,
there
was
every
confrontation
that
you
can
want
and
therefore,
perhaps
that's
enough
to
dispose
of
the
case
if
it
is,
what
i
have
more
to
say
is
irrelevant.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
conceivably
there
is
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
perhaps
i
would
prefer
to
put
it
this
way
mr.
justice.
if
there
is
any
question,
it
is
only
a
question
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
don't
regard
that
question
as
serious
but
i
thought
it
of
enough
concern
that
it
was
appropriate
to
devote
a
part
of
my
argument
to
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
were
talking
about
the
admission
of
prior
inconsistent
statements
as
affirmative
evidence.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
what
i
am
seeking
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice,
that's
my
personal
view
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
my
concern
here
is
that
when
the
court
reads
this
record
and
finds
that
it
is
a
pretty
thin
case
that
we
may
end
up
with
a
constitutionally
prescribed
rule
with
respect
to
the
rules
of
evidence
as
a
means
of
disposing
of
it.
when
i
think
it
opt
to
be
disposed
off
simply
on
the
narrow
ground
of
whether
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
support
a
verdict
of
guilty
as
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
that
gets
close
to
the
area
of
thompson
and
louisville
although
this
is
--
this
is
different
from
that
case
in
many
ways.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
confrontation
overtones
in
the
language
in
bridges.
this
is
quoted
in
our
--
the
passage
is
quoted
in
our
brief.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
passage
is
on
page
22
of
our
brief.
to
admit
this
prior
statement
in
bridges
said
the
court
so
to
hold
would
allow
men
to
be
convicted
on
unsworn
testimony
of
witnesses,
a
practice
which
runs
counter
to
the
notions
to
fairness
on
which
our
legal
system
is
founded.
now,
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that's
due
process
talk
i
suppose
but
perhaps
that's
the
reason
why
i
thought
it
was
relevant
to
make
a
due
process
argument
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
i
have
interjected
this
as
a
means
of
hoping
to
divert
you
from
deciding
this
case
against
the
government
on
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
a
diversionary
argument,
a
confession
in
avoidance.
what
i
am
concerned
with
is
that
we
should
not
end
up
with
this
case
by
finding
that
for
the
first
time
in
a
180
years,
it
has
been
discovered
that
the
hearsay
rules
are
embodied
in
the
constitution
on
one
ground
or
another
and
are
beyond
the
powers
of
state
legislatures
to
change,
to
innovate,
to
experiment
and
indeed
beyond
the
powers
of
people
who
formulate
federal
rules
of
evidence
which
of
course
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
not
suggesting
mr.
justice
that
you
should.
i
am
suggesting
you
should
remand
to
the
supreme
court
of
california
to
do
that
was
such
intimation
as
you
care
to
include
in
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
does
not.
it
means
that
you
decide
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
was
wrong
in
its
decision
below
and
in
the
johnson
case
that
this
is
not
a
constitutional
requirement
but
that
you
can
feel
satisfied
that
nevertheless
justice
will
be
done
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice,
i
can't
quite
say
it's
none
of
your
business
since
the
court
put
it
into
the
constitution
about
three
weeks
ago.
the
question
of
whether
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
being
a
constitutional
requirement
and
i
don't
know
that
the
court
can
completely
escape
that
though
it
can
delegate
it
quite
widely
and
expect
that
the
delegation
will
be
peacefully
honored.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
assume
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
want
mr.
justice,
my
whole
objective
is
that
when
you
read
this
record,
i
don't
think
you'll
think
the
state's
case
is
very
strong
and
i
don't
want
that
to
result
in
an
affirmance
of
the
state's
decision
which
puts
this
rule
of
evidence
into
the
constitution
and
there
are
--
there
is
another
way
which
is
to
reverse
these
decisions
below
on
the
constitutional
questions
and
remand
it
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
inconsistent.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
alright.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
exactly
mr.
justice,
that's
my
point.
now,
this
question
of
the
admissibility
of
prior
inconsistent
statements
as
evidence
is
one
which
has
been
discussed
over
a
period
of
two
generations.
it
is
sometimes
--
it
seems
to
me
denigrate
a
little
bit
by
talking
it
about
the
orthodox
rule
and
the
academic
view.
the
academic
view
for
which
we
speak
here
has
been
supported
by
some
very
great
figures.
we
ignore
who
is
one
of
our
authentic
greats
and
morgan
and
judge
weinstein
can
hardly
be
called
impractical
persons.
this
change
in
the
california
statute
section
1235
was
recommended
by
a
state
commission
in
california
which
had
a
staff
of
which
professor
james
a.
chadman
was
the
chief
reporter.
he
is
now
at
the
harvard
law
school
and
is
the
editor
carrying
out
the
current
revisions
with
more
on
evidence.
this
rule
is
supported
by
distinguished
members
of
the
bench
not
impractical
men
such
as
judge
learned
hand
whom
i've
already
quoted
and
judge
henry
friendly
who
is
cited
in
our
brief.
from
bantam
to
the
present
time,
authorities
have
agreed
that
present
hearsay
law
keeps
reliable
evidence
from
the
courtroom.
we
should
be
continued
to
be
free
to
experiment
in
this
area
by
legislation,
by
delegated
rule
making
and
by
judicial
decision.
the
area
should
not
be
frozen
into
a
constitutional
rule
by
application
of
a
constitutional
provision
which
says
nothing
about
it
and
obviously
has
no
application
to
the
problem
either
in
terms
or
in
light
of
its
history.
i
speak
of
course
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
i
earlier
contented
that
the
sixth
amendment
whether
incorporated
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
not
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
since
the
defendant
here
did
confront
both
of
the
human
witnesses
involved.
there's
no
case
in
this
court
which
requires
affirmance
of
the
court
below
either
here
or
in
its
decision
in
the
johnson
case.
on
the
contrary,
affirmance
here
is
nothing
less
than
reading
into
the
fourteenth
amendment,
a
conclusion
that
hearsay
evidence
is
always
inadmissible
for
this
evidence
cannot
come
in,
it
is
hard
to
see
how
any
extra
judicial
statements
can
be
received.
that
would
be
a
revolution
not
only
in
the
law
of
evidence
but
in
constitutional
law
and
if
the
court
thinks
i
am
overstating,
i
can
only
say
that's
what
the
california
court
has
decided
in
both
of
these
cases.
and
moreover
since
we're
talking
about
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
not
the
sixth
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
borrow
a
little
time
form
mr.
james
with
his
permission.
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be
limited
to
criminal
cases.
it
would
apparently
apply
to
civil
cases
as
well
for
they
are
surely
subject
to
the
fourteenth
and
the
fifth
amendment.
apparently,
such
a
rule
would
apply
to
the
administrative
process
too
where
we
widely
had
statute
saying
that
the
rules
of
evidence
shall
not
apply.
such
a
conclusion
would
go
beyond
anything
that
is
needed
or
useful
or
warranted.
it
would
go
far
beyond
any
conception
of
due
process
which
is
part
of
our
tradition
or
a
concept
of
ordered
liberty.
our
law
has
always
accepted
hearsay
evidence
and
evidence
of
extra-judicial
statements
and
actions
often
without
authorized
cross
examination
under
one
or
another
of
a
great
many
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rule
and
i
would
point
out
of
course
that
other
systems
of
law
widely
admits
hearsay
evidence
subject
only
to
the
weight
to
be
attributed
to
it
and
the
scholars
in
those
systems
often
find
themselves
quite
unable
to
understand
our
concern
about
hearsay.
often,
in
one
situation
or
another
and
particularly
in
administrative
proceedings
of
one
kind
or
another,
our
law
has
specifically
provided
that
no
hearsay
rule
shall
apply
and
that
the
only
test
of
the
admissibility
of
evidence
shall
be
its
relevance
with
its
weight
under
all
of
the
circumstances
to
be
a
matter
for
the
trier
of
the
facts.
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
such
rules
are
irrational,
it
ought
not
to
be
said
that
they
are
forbidden
by
the
constitution.
if
states
wants
to
expand
the
admissibility
of
evidence
within
sound
reason,
they
should
be
free
to
do
so.
as
i've
indicated,
justice
should
be
done
in
this
case
but
not
by
distorting
our
rules
of
evidence
and
putting
it
beyond
development
and
change.
this
is
not
a
case
for
a
constitutional
decision
and
the
california
court
was
wrong
in
thinking
that
this
court's
decisions
required
it
to
dispose
off
the
case
on
federal
constitutional
grounds.
now,
that
error
should
be
corrected
and
the
case
should
then
be
remanded
to
the
california
court
for
further
proceedings
are
not
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decision.
