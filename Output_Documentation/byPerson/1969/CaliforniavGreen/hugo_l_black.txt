justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
object
of
a
preliminary
trial
in
california?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
it's
found,
what
is
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
held
for
the
purpose
of
determining
on
whether
or
not
there
will
be
a
warrant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
information,
what
information?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
have
any
grand
jury
investigation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
this
one
was
not
a
grand
jury
investigation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
court
had
decided
on
preliminary
trial
there
would
be
--
there
was
no
probable
cause?
justice
hugo
l.
black
hew
would
be
released?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
difference
in
the
procedures
when
you
try
him
for
preliminary
trial
here
and
back
to
the
trial
of
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
put
on
witnesses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
the
proceeding,
at
the
preliminary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
the
defendant
put
on
witnesses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
cannot
put
on
witnesses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
may?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
wants
to
have
a
lawyer
and
put
on
witnesses
he
has
a
right
to
do
both?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
is
the
reason
suggested
by
that
is
not
the
kind
of
a
trial
or
proceeding
or
you
could
use
the
evidence
from
here,
if
you
could
use
it
from
any
other
place,
that
it
had
been
a
cross
examination
or
counseling?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
case
do
you
say
about
richards?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah,
the
one
you
first
mentioned,
richards?
richards'
case
on
pending
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
never
heard
that
before.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
effect
does
that
have
on
the
examination?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can't
understand
reason
for
you
argument,
the
examination
is
somehow
different.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
both
sides.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
why
it
would
be
different,
it's
not
in
my
state
--
i
don't
know
why
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
the
probable
cause
of
guilt.
guilt
in
each
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
either
in
the
preliminary
or
the
other.
one
of
the
probable
cause
of
guilt
and
now
that
it's
just
guilt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
issue
is
not
worded
precisely
the
same
but
i
just
don't
understand
this
idea
that
it's
some
different.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
that
alabama's
rule
is
different
to
the
most
states,
i'm
not
saying
it's
not,
but
as
far
as
asking
you
this
question
about
why
they're
different.
justice
hugo
l.
black
sometimes,
preliminary
is
not
tried
for
months,
two
months,
three
months.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
not
the
whole
coverage,
not
as
earliest
time
as
possible.
they
are
not
always
held
that
early.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
maybe
true.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
asking
you
about
the
difference,
it
might
be
different
in
those
things.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
maybe
true
but
i
just
can't
understand
it
because
that
was
tried,
meaning,
we
examined
just
like
you
are
on
the
regular
trial,
no
difference
in
it
and
sometimes
it's
a
week,
two
months,
something
but
always
we
really
had
a
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it's
a
jurisdiction,
that's
what
sometimes,
is
it
not?
but
suppose
if
a
jurisdiction
it
does
have
regular,
not
bound,
drag
out
trial
and
cross
examination.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
would
be
a
different
judge
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
different
lawyer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
not
going
any
distinction
between
the
legal
relevancy
of
the
statement
made
at
a
preliminary
trial
where
there
is
a
cross
examination
and
one
made
to
an
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
doubt
about
the
issues
being
different.
the
issue
is
filed
on
whether
he
is
guilty
or
probably
cause
for
guilt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
might
understand
from
you
that
the
person
should
be
against,
on
the
issue
with
reference
to
the
preliminary
trial.
that
he
can't
be
against
you
on
the
others
--
for
you
on
the
others.
are
you
putting
him
on
the
same
level?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
one
where
they
have
a
chance
of
cross
examination
at
a
preliminary
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
the
one
to
whom
state
--
just
where
a
statement
is
made
to
an
officer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
object
of
a
preliminary
trial
in

information,
what

justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
have
any
grand
jury
investigation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
this
one
was
not
a
grand
jury
investigation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
court
had
decided
on
preliminary
trial
there
would
be
--
there
was
no
probable
cause?
justice
hugo
l.
black
hew
would
be
released?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
difference
in
the
procedures
when
you
try
him
for
preliminary
trial
here
and
back
to
the
trial
of
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
put
on
witnesses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
the
proceeding,
at
the
preliminary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
the
defendant
put
on
witnesses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
cannot
put
on
witnesses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
may?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
wants
to
have
a
lawyer
and
put
on
witnesses
he
has
a
right
to
do
both?
justice
hugo

black
well,
what
is
the

justice

black
what
case
do
you
say
about
richards?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah,
the
one
you
first
mentioned,
richards?
richards'
case
on
pending
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
never
heard
that
before.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
effect
does
that
have
on
the
examination?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can't
understand
reason
for
you
argument,
the
examination
is
somehow
different.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
both
sides.
justice
hugo

black
i
don't
understand
why
it
would
be
different,
it's
not
in
my
state
--
i
don't
know
why
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
the
probable
cause
of
guilt.
guilt
in
each
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
either
in
the
preliminary
or
the
other.
one
of
the
probable
cause
of
guilt
and
now
that
it's
just
guilt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo

but
the
issue
is

that
was

it's
a

two

something

always
we
