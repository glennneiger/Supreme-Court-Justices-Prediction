mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
simply
in
response
to
that,
it
may
be
relevant.
though
of
course
it’s
not
i
the
record
that
the
staff
of
the
distributor
of
this
film
was
not
a
commercial
pornographer,
has
dropped
from
39
to
3
and
great
part
as
a
result
to
the
cost
of
this
particular
litigation.
so
it
certainly
does
have
a
chilling
effect.
not
only
under
distribution
of
films
that
are
close
to
the
line
but
on
the
distribution
and
the
operation
of
a
company
which
decides
to
distribute
films
which
run
the
gambit
and
which
may
run
a
foul
of
state
conceptions
of
immorality.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
no
but
we
do
with
reference
to
the
drop
in
this
stock.
at
least
in
part
and
i
think
--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
well
speculative
but
i
think
is
supported
by
the
information
that
we
have
at
hand
but
i
did
want
to
dwell
on
that.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
well
i
think
the
solicitor
general
has
suggested
the
only
possible
distinction
between
the
stanley
case
and
retro
cases
that
preceded
it
and
the
case
that’s
before
this
court
now.
that
is
the
distinction
which
rests
on
public
sensibilities.
that
is
the
public
knows
what’s
going
on
in
the
theater
whereas
the
public
does
not
know
what’s
going
on
in
a
private
home.
i
submit
that
that
distinction
was
rejected
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
griswold
versus
connecticut.
in
that
case
you
will
recall
the
prosecution
was
not
directed
against
the
users
of
birth
control.
the
couple,
the
married,
couple
that
was
directed
against
clinics,
centers
they
will
call
under
connecticut
law.
they
were
open
centers,
they
were
visible,
they
were
so
to
speak
on
pennsylvania
avenue.
they
were
of
course
discreet
and
yet
they
disseminated
the
information
and
materials
necessary
for
a
birth
control.
the
public,
knew
that
birth
control
information
was
being
disseminated
and
the
public
in
connecticut
was
offended
by
that
fact
alone
as
reflected
by
its
legislation.
yet
this
court
decided
not
only
to
protect
the
rights
of
those
who
would
use
birth
control
materials
and
information
but
also
necessarily
by
its
holding
the
right
of
a
clinic
though
its
public
in
some
senses
to
discretely
give
out
the
information
and
materials
necessary
for
the
effectuation
of
the
primary
right.
now
in
an
important
respect,
this
case
is
a
fortiori
from
the
griswold
case.
the
griswold
case
involved
purely,
the
fourth
amendment
right.
the
constitution
is
neutral
on
whether
or
not
couples
practice
birth
control.
there
is
no
first
amendment
right
involved
there.
indeed,
it’s
an
activity
rather
than
any
arguable
speech.
so
that
case
relied
exclusively
under
fourth
amendment.
this
case
although
it
may
conceivably
have
fourth
amendment
overtones,
we
concede
it
cited
the
olmstead
case.
certainly
also
the
government
would
concede
has
important
first
amendment
overtones.
the
primary
right,
the
right
to
satisfy
ones
emotional
and
intellectual
needs
in
the
privacy
of
his
home
is
a
first
amendment
right
centrally.
and
so
one
would
think,
i
certainly
would
argue
that
the
decision
of
this
court
permitting
the
dissemination
of
material
necessary
for
the
use
of
birth
control
in
the
griswold
case
would
necessarily
require
a
limited
discrete
opportunity
to
obtain
the
materials
which
are
necessary
to
satisfy
the
intellectual
and
emotional
needs
described
in
the
stanley
case.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
right.
now
on
the
bearbaiting
i
would
think
there
is
no
constitutional
protection
for
bearbaiting.
bearbaiting
is
an
act
of
course.
it’s
a
real
act.
animals
are
killed.
the
constitution
certainly
permits
the
states
the
right
to
protect
the
interest
of
animals
as
distinguished
from
the
interest
of
the
sensibilities
of
those
people
who
are
concerned
about
the
rights
of
animals.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
both?
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
well,
i
think
the
example
would
be
better
if
were
a
film,
as
you
put
it,
a
film
of
bearbaiting.
we
know
--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
well
i
think
i
would
have
to
say
then
that
the
constitution
does
not
permit
individuals
who
choose
to
have
their
sensibilities
offended.
perhaps
that’s
a
contradictory
term.
to
choose
to
have
your
sensibilities
offended.
the
constitution
would
not
permit
prohibition
of
an
event.
if
it
were
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
arguable
bearbaiting
itself
might
not
be
the
film
where
an
exhibition
of
it
might
be
--
would
protect
that
right,
if
the
only
interest
at
stake
were
the
desire
to
protect
people
against
sensibilities
which
they
have
voluntarily
decided
not
to
be
protected
against.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
no
i
wouldn’t
say
that.
i
would
say
a
state
would
have
the
right
to
prohibit
the
killing
of
dogs
and
bears
whether
for
film
or
for
other
purposes.
the
protection
of
animals
is
perhaps
arguably
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
the
fact
that
many
people
have
seen
it
--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
no,
the
first
amendment
protects
the
individual
right
to
receive
information
necessary
to
satisfy
his
emotional
intellectual
needs.
the
fact
that
some
people
in
baltimore
might
come
to
see
it
in
washington,
the
fact
that
some
other
people
in
the
united
states
have
seen
it,
to
me,
to
our
argument
is
not
necessarily
relevant.
in
fact,
there
were
many
people
who
would
like
to
participate
in
an
activity
which
has
first
amendment
ramifications
and
which
the
state
is
forbidding
them
to
participate
in
that
is
to
watch,
to
exercise
the
first
amendment
right
for
no
arguable,
for
no
presentable
reason.
now,
certainly
what
we
would
argue
is
that
if
a
person
takes
a
shower
on
pennsylvania
avenue
that
certainly
is
proscribable
on
a
number
of
grounds.
first
of
all
it
is
not
speech
but
more
important
it
offends
people.
people
don’t
want
to
see
other
people
taking
showers
on
pennsylvania
avenue.
the
thrust
of
our
opinion
would
give
the
prosecutors
great
powers
to
look
at
what’s
offending
other
people.
it
would
take
them
from
within
the
private
theater,
the
theater
that
only
is
attended
by
people
who
want
to
go
and
would
put
them
outside
the
theater
to
protect
you
and
me
from
the
intrusion
on
our
sensibilities
that
would
occur.
if
movies
opened
on
pennsylvania
avenue
and
advertised
in
a
pandering
way,
thrust
its
advertisements
or
its
pictures
or
its
commercials
on
unwilling
viewers.
that
is
clearly
not
involved
in
this
case.
the
state
conceded
on
july
14th,
1969
in
open
court
that
there
was
no
pandering.
the
advertising
was
discrete.
no
children
were
permitted
into
the
theater.
the
theater
was
policing
that
the
public
was
forewarned
and
yet
not
forewarned
in
a
way
as
it
is
so
typical
of
many
movies.
not
forewarned
in
a
way
which
titillates.
it
was
forewarned
in
a
discrete
way
so
that
what
is
involved
in
this
case
is
the
classic
instance
of
only
adults
who
choose
to
see
an
exhibition
which
the
second
circuit
has
held
to
be
with
socially
redeeming
value.
only
those
adults
are
being
denied
the
right
to
see
that
a
first
amendment
protected
material
we
argue
simple
because
of
some
tenable
claim
that
public
sensibility
may
be
offended
because
others
outside
the
theater
know
that
people
inside
the
theater
are
viewing
this
kind
of
film.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
no.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
no.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
by
all
means.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
that’s
right.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
yes
it
does.
we
would
argue
that
the
constitution
gives
greater
protection
to
the
right
of
privacy
in
this
regard
than
the
right
to
offend
people
by
thrusting
upon
them
stimuli.
that
is
everybody
who
wants
to
see
somebody
showering,
assuming
that
would
have
some
first
amendment
protection
could
do
it
in
a
first
--
in
a
closed
private
theater.
there
is
no
need
to
do
it
on
pennsylvania
avenue
or
innocent
people
would
be
offended.
and
so
i
would
say
all
doubts
must
be
resolved
in
favor
of
privacy.
but
this
case
presents
no
doubts.
there
is
nobody,
not
a
single
human
being
who
was
being
offended
because
a
stimuli
is
being
thrust
on
him.
the
only
claim
is
that
a
human
being
is
being
offended
by
passing
by
the
symphony
cinema
theater
and
seeing
a
discrete
sign
saying
“i
am
curious
yellow
is
playing
inside.”
we
submit
that
kind
of
offense
which
is
identical
to
the
offense
of
a
person
passing
by
a
birth
control
clinic
does
not
deserve
constitutional
protection
when
fitted
against
an
arguably
first
amendment
protective
right.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
judge
aldrich
addressed
himself
to
that
question
in
oral
argument
and
he
said
that
there
must
be
adequate
warning
before
and
an
opportunity
indeed
to
leave
in
the
middle
at
any
given
time.
indeed
there
was
no
evidence.
the
state
might
have
sought
to
introduce
but
there
was
no
evidence
of
a
single
complaint
brought
by
a
single
person
of
course
other
than
a
policeman
who
went
to
see
the
film,
nobody
complained
about
its
offensive
character.
one
can
imagine
a
constitutional
statute
which
punishes
a
film
which
deceptively
lures
people
into
the
theater
on
the
assumption
that
it’s
something
else
and
then
it
turns
out
to
be
an
offense
or
obnoxious
film
and
complaints
filed.
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
well
of
course
the
admission
charge
would
be,
we
argue,
irrelevant
under
this
court’s
holding
in
the
times
case
and
at
the
state
circuit.
under
our
system,
people
simply
must
make
money
for
an
activity
to
go
forward
and
first
amendment
activities
must
be
operated
within
our
capitalistic
system
as
well
as
other
activities
if
they
are
in
fact
to
occur.
bearbaiting,
i’ve
state
previously,
bearbaiting
is
not
in
our
view
protected
by
the
constitution
because
it
is
a,
an
act,
b,
it
hurts
animals.
but
if
it
were
a
movie
that
were
being
played
inside,
yes
we
would
have
to
argue
that
a
movie
played
in
a
discrete
theater.
remember,
i
would
like
to
remind
this
court
simply
that
it
need
not
necessarily
reach
the
issue
of
hardcore
pornography
in
this
case
because
there
was
no
assumption
that
this
film
was
hardcore
pornography,
no
claim
that
was
hardcore
pornography
and
the
second
circuit
decision
can
at
least
be
relevant
to
the
sense,
to
the
extent
of
allowing
this
court
to
decide
the
case
on
a
record
other
than
a
hardcore
pornography
exhibition
in
a
closed
control
movie
theater.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
if
the
process
is
unlawful
then
there
is
no
right
to
make
a
film.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
the
process
of
bearbaiting?
the
state
has
the
right
to
make
bearbaiting
unlawful.
take
another
hypothetical
of
the
film
being
made
of
a
bank
robbery
in
process.
we
know
that
these
things
now
occur.
surely
there
is
a
right
to
exhibit
that
film
in
a
public
controlled
theater
even
though
it
might
be
offensive
to
many.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
right.
and
i
would
think
that
bearbaiting
would
be
illegal
whether
privately
performed
there
otherwise
because
it
results
in
the
killing
of
animals.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
i
think
the
analogy,
bearbaiting
is
not
valid
in
the
sense
that
bearbaiting
which
is
an
act
and
which
is
an
illegal
act
in
which
hurts
animals
is
different
from
the
film
made
of
acts
legal
where
committed
in
fact
in
this
case
of
being
presented
on
a
screen
to
a
public
who
has
chosen
to
view
that.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
but
not
on
pennsylvania
avenue.
the
showing
of
film
people
showering
at
pennsylvania
avenue
would
be
illegal.
indeed
the
showing
of
a
film
of
people
showering
in
a
home
would
be
illegal
if
the
curtains
weren’t
drawn
down.
we
would
argue
that
a
theater
with
its
curtains
drawn
down
deserves
more
constitutional
protection
than
a
home
with
its
shades
drawn
up.
that
one
must
look
at
the
functional
definition
of
privacy
and
functionally
a
theater
which
is
closed
is
more
private
than
a
home
which
shades
are
open.
thank
you.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
simply
in
response
to
that,
it
may
be
relevant.
though
of
course
it’s
not
i
the

mr.

no

we
do
with

to
the
drop
in
this

at

in

i

--

i
submit
that
that

was
rejected

in

you

now
on

i
would
think
there
is
no
constitutional
protection
for
bearbaiting.
bearbaiting
is
an
act
of
course.
it’s
a
real
act.
animals
are
killed.
the
constitution
certainly
permits
the
states
the
right
to
protect
the
interest
of
animals
as
distinguished
from
the
interest
of
the
sensibilities
of
those
people
who
are
concerned
about
the
rights
of
animals.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
both?
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
well,
i
think
the
example
would
be
better
if
were
a
film,
as
you
put
it,
a
film
of
bearbaiting.
we
know
--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
well
i
think
i
would
have
to
say
then
that
the
constitution
does
not
permit
individuals
who
choose
to
have
their
sensibilities
offended.
perhaps
that’s
a
contradictory
term.
to
choose
to
have
your
sensibilities
offended.
the
constitution
would
not
permit
prohibition
of
an
event.
if
it
were
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
arguable
bearbaiting
itself
might
not
be
the
film
where
an
exhibition
of
it
might
be
--
would
protect
that
right,
if
the
only
interest
at
stake
were
the
desire
to
protect
people
against
sensibilities
which
they
have
voluntarily
decided
not
to
be
protected
against.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
no
i
wouldn’t
say
that.
i
would
say
a
state
would
have
the
right
to
prohibit
the
killing
of
dogs
and
bears
whether
for
film
or
for
other
purposes.
the
protection
of
animals
is
perhaps
arguably
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
the
fact
that
many
people
have
seen
it
--
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
no,
the
first
amendment
protects
the
individual
right
to
receive
information
necessary
to
satisfy
his
emotional
intellectual
needs.
the
fact
that
some
people
in
baltimore
might
come
to
see
it
in
washington,
the
fact
that
some
other
people
in
the
united
states
have
seen
it,
to
me,
to
our
argument
is
not
necessarily
relevant.
in
fact,
there
were
many
people
who
would
like
to
participate
in
an
activity
which
has
first
amendment
ramifications
and
which
the
state
is
forbidding
them
to
participate
in
that
is
to
watch,
to
exercise
the
first
amendment
right
for
no
arguable,
for
no
presentable
reason.
now,
certainly
what
we
would
argue
is
that
if
a
person
takes
a
shower
on
pennsylvania
avenue
that
certainly
is
proscribable
on
a
number
of
grounds.
first
of
all
it
is
not
speech
but
more
important
it
offends
people.
people
don’t
want
to
see
other
people
taking
showers
on
pennsylvania
avenue.
the
thrust
of
our
opinion
would
give
the
prosecutors
great
powers
to
look
at
what’s
offending
other
people.
it
would
take
them
from
within
the
private
theater,
the
theater
that
only
is
attended
by
people
who
want
to
go
and
would
put
them
outside
the
theater
to
protect
you
and
me
from
the
intrusion
on
our
sensibilities
that
would
occur.
if
movies
opened
on
pennsylvania
avenue
and
advertised
in
a
pandering
way,
thrust
its
advertisements
or
its
pictures
or
its
commercials
on
unwilling
viewers.
that
is
clearly
not
involved
in
this
case.
the
state
conceded
on
july
14th,
1969
in
open
court
that
there
was
no
pandering.
the
advertising
was
discrete.
no
children
were
permitted
into
the
theater.
the
theater
was
policing
that
the
public
was
forewarned
and
yet
not
forewarned
in
a
way
as
it
is
so
typical
of
many
movies.
not
forewarned
in
a
way
which
titillates.
it
was
forewarned
in
a
discrete
way
so
that
what
is
involved
in
this
case
is
the
classic
instance
of
only
adults
who
choose
to
see
an
exhibition
which
the
second
circuit
has
held
to
be
with
socially
redeeming
value.
only
those
adults
are
being
denied
the
right
to
see
that
a
first
amendment
protected
material
we
argue
simple
because
of
some
tenable
claim
that
public
sensibility
may
be
offended
because
others
outside
the
theater
know
that
people
inside
the
theater
are
viewing
this
kind
of
film.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
no.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
no.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
by
all
means.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
that’s
right.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
yes
it
does.
we
would
argue
that
the
constitution
gives
greater
protection
to
the
right
of
privacy
in
this
regard
than
the
right
to
offend
people
by
thrusting
upon
them
stimuli.
that
is
everybody
who
wants
to
see
somebody
showering,
assuming
that
would
have
some
first
amendment
protection
could
do
it
in
a
first
--
in
a
closed
private
theater.
there
is
no
need
to
do
it
on
pennsylvania
avenue
or
innocent
people
would
be
offended.
and
so
i
would
say
all
doubts
must
be
resolved
in
favor
of
privacy.
but
this
case
presents
no
doubts.
there
is
nobody,
not
a
single
human
being
who
was
being
offended
because
a
stimuli
is
being
thrust
on
him.
the
only
claim
is
that
a
human
being
is
being
offended
by
passing
by
the
symphony
cinema
theater
and
seeing
a
discrete
sign
saying
“i
am
curious
yellow
is
playing
inside.”
we
submit
that
kind
of
offense
which
is
identical
to
the
offense
of
a
person
passing
by
a
birth
control
clinic
does
not
deserve
constitutional
protection
when
fitted
against
an
arguably
first
amendment
protective
right.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
judge
aldrich
addressed
himself
to
that
question
in
oral
argument
and
he
said
that
there
must
be
adequate
warning
before
and
an
opportunity
indeed
to
leave
in
the
middle
at
any
given
time.
indeed
there
was
no
evidence.
the
state
might
have
sought
to
introduce
but
there
was
no
evidence
of
a
single
complaint
brought
by
a
single
person
of
course
other
than
a
policeman
who
went
to
see
the
film,
nobody
complained
about
its
offensive
character.
one
can
imagine
a
constitutional
statute
which
punishes
a
film
which
deceptively
lures
people
into
the
theater
on
the
assumption
that
it’s
something
else
and
then
it
turns
out
to
be
an
offense
or
obnoxious
film
and
complaints
filed.
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
well
of
course
the
admission
charge
would
be,
we
argue,
irrelevant
under
this
court’s
holding
in
the
times
case
and
at
the
state
circuit.
under
our
system,
people
simply
must
make
money
for
an
activity
to
go
forward
and
first
amendment
activities
must
be
operated
within
our
capitalistic
system
as
well
as
other
activities
if
they
are
in
fact
to
occur.
bearbaiting,
i’ve
state
previously,
bearbaiting
is
not
in
our
view
protected
by
the
constitution
because
it
is
a,
an
act,
b,
it
hurts
animals.
but
if
it
were
a
movie
that
were
being
played
inside,
yes
we
would
have
to
argue
that
a
movie
played
in
a
discrete
theater.
remember,
i
would
like
to
remind
this
court
simply
that
it
need
not
necessarily
reach
the
issue
of
hardcore
pornography
in
this
case
because
there
was
no
assumption
that
this
film
was
hardcore
pornography,
no
claim
that
was
hardcore
pornography
and
the
second
circuit
decision
can
at
least
be
relevant
to
the
sense,
to
the
extent
of
allowing
this
court
to
decide
the
case
on
a
record
other
than
a
hardcore
pornography
exhibition
in
a
closed
control
movie
theater.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
if
the
process
is
unlawful
then
there
is
no
right
to
make
a
film.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
the
process
of
bearbaiting?
the
state
has
the
right
to
make
bearbaiting
unlawful.
take
another
hypothetical
of
the
film
being
made
of
a
bank
robbery
in
process.
we
know
that
these
things
now
occur.
surely
there
is
a
right
to
exhibit
that
film
in
a
public
controlled
theater
even
though
it
might
be
offensive
to
many.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
right.
and
i
would
think
that
bearbaiting
would
be
illegal
whether
privately
performed
there
otherwise
because
it
results
in
the
killing
of
animals.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
i
think
the
analogy,
bearbaiting
is
not
valid
in
the
sense
that
bearbaiting
which
is
an
act
and
which
is
an
illegal
act
in
which
hurts
animals
is
different
from
the
film
made
of
acts
legal
where
committed
in
fact
in
this
case
of
being
presented
on
a
screen
to
a
public
who
has
chosen
to
view
that.
mr.
alan
m.
dershowitz
but
not
on
pennsylvania
avenue.
the
showing
of
film
people
showering
at
pennsylvania
avenue
would
be
illegal.
indeed
the
showing
of
a
film
of
people
showering
in
a
home
would
be
illegal
if
the
curtains
weren’t
drawn
down.
we
would
argue
that
a
theater
with
its
curtains
drawn
down
deserves
more
constitutional
protection
than
a
home
with
its
shades
drawn
up.
that
one
must
look
at
the
functional
definition
of
privacy
and
functionally
a
theater
which
is
closed
is
more
private
than
a
home
which
shades
are
open.
thank
you.
