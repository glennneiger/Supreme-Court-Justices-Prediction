did
you
say
number
1249?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
can
a
man
who's
charged
with
a
crime
if
he
able
to
know
for
himself
in
the
events
of
the
trial
whether
or
not
a
piece
of
literature
or
whatever
you
may
want
to
call
it
has
a
redeeming
social
value?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah,
but
what
i'm
getting
at
here
is
if
one
element
of
the
crime
here
that
whatever
you're
examining
has
no
redeeming
social
value,
how
can
any
man
who
handles
literature
of
any
kind
know
whether
he
is
violating
it
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
the
federal
constitution
requires,
no
man
be
convicted
of
a
crime
unless
it's
accurately
described
so
that
he
can
know
whether
he
is
violating
the
law,
that
is
a
state
problem
and
a
federal
problem,
isn't
it?
and
if
he
cannot
be
convicted,
if
the
test
at
each
time
whether
it
has
a
redeeming
social
value,
is
that
to
proven
by
evidence?
is
it
to
be
proven
by
the
--
tried
by
the
jury
or
is
it
to
be
tried
by
this
court
ultimately?
and
can
a
man
ever
know
whether
it
has
redeeming
social
value
until
his
particular
case
gets
up
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
those
facts
--
the
facts
in
the
case
was
sufficient
to
show
that
the
article
of
whatever
that
was
purchase
to
sell
as
a
redeeming
social
value.
that
should
test
to
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
life
would
have
its
hazards
but
under
the
constitution
suppose
everybody
has
suppose
i
thought
up
to
now
on
the
discussion
of
obscenity,
no
man
could
be
convicted
of
a
crime
unless
it
could
be
defined
in
such
a
way
that
he
could
know
whether
he
is
violating
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
solicitor
general
able
to
give
us
anymore
definite
definition
of
this
crime
than
it
must
be
something
that
does
not
have
a
redeeming
social
value?
if
so,
what
is
its
definition?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
just
talking
about
the
position
of
any
individual.
i'm
talking
about
a
situation
that
has
been
on
evident,
honest,
deliberate
purpose
to
find
some
way
to
make
a
definition
that
does
not
leave
people
in
uncertainty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
solicitor
general
any
idea
of
a
better
way
than
the
test
to
be
whether
it
has
redeeming
social
value.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
why
there's
struggle?
justice
hugo
l.
black
lucrative
guess.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
doesn't
he
have
to
make
a
guess?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
we
know
exactly
what
ideas
the
framers
had
in
mind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
undoubtedly.
undoubtedly,
but
i
thought
the
object
to
the
constitution
was
to
say
what
the
government
could
do
and
what
it
could
not
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
didn't
just
ratify
what
had
been
done
before,
did
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
you
to
agree
with
the
statement
that
was
many
businessmen
think
there
are
no
boundaries.
are
you
saying
that
you
do
not
think
of
anymore
about
solid
boundaries
for
the
antitrust
laws
then
for
obscenity
which
are
you
saying?
you
said
you
agreed
to
something.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
think
that's
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
would
like
to
--
i
think
we're
lost
on
that.
hardcore
pornography.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

you
can
understand
it
with
your
brain.
when
you
hear
it
--
i
don't
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
only
conclusion
the
other
way
is
just
to
say
there
was
sex
which
is
one
of
the
strongest
urges
of
the
human
race
cannot
be
publicly
discussed
or
privately
discuss
unless
you
would
straight
some
other
amendment
to
fit
the
project.
it
puts
that
subject
out
of
this
--
of
course
it
can't
be
done,
everybody
knows
that
it
can't
be
done.
you
can't
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
your
judgment
that
the
court
can
do
any
better
if
it's
as
deadly
to
create
a
definition.
they
can't
do
any
better
than
what's
done
in
the
opinion
written
by
my
brother
brennan?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
either.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
you
in
the
answer
to
the
question
that
you
say
that
you
concede
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
protect
this
literature
or
whatever
it
is
they're
talking
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
do
your
concede
that
that
court
have
decided
that
up
to
now,
which
do
you
concede?
that's
quite
different
(voice
overlap)
if
you're
making
a
confession
that
first
amendment
doesn't
protect
you.
i
would
like
to
know
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
making
a
concession
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
protect
your
client?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understood
you
to
answer
the
question
if
you
concede
it,
the
chief
asked
you
a
question
if
you
concede
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
surely,
you
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
--
if
it
has
that
vow,
well,
why
hasn't
it
done
so
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can't
see
that
part
of
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
is
it
not
specific?
i
thought
it
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
specific
as
it
could
be
made.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
it
be
made
anymore
specific?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
procedural
safeguard,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
that
i
understand
you
to
say
now.
you're
defending
this
on
the
ground
that
although
a
court
can
abridge
speech
that
the
court
deems
immoral
or
obscene
that
here
it
hasn't
done
so,
it's
definitely
and
i
think
it
has
in
the
state
of
massachusetts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
--
that
doesn't
decide
anything
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
attorney
general
decides
that
the
attorney
general
thinks
it's
constitutional.
that
wouldn't
be
binding
on
anybody,
would
it?
justice

l.
black
yes,
the

decides
it's
constitutional.
would
that
be
binding
on
the
evidence?
justice

the
what?
