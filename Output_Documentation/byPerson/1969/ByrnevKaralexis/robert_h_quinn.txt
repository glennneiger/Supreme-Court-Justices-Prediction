mr.
robert
h.
quinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
here
on
appeal
from
an
interlocutory
order
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts
under
the
provisions
of
28
u.s.c
1253.
that
provides
for
direct
appeal
from
an
order
or
judgment
of
a
three-judge
court
granting
temporary
injunctive
relief
against
the
enforcement
of
a
state
statute.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
our
view,
this
appeal
presents
two
equally
important
issues
which
ought
to
be
finally
resolved
by
this
court.
the
first
is
whether
the
court
below
abused
its
discretion
in
enjoining
the
district
attorney
from
prosecuting
in
the
future
on
account
on
the
showing
off
the
film
“i
am
curious
(yellow)”,
which
the
court
below
assumed
to
be
obscene.
the
second
is
whether
under
this
court's
holding
in
stanley
versus
georgia
any
state
to
unconstitutionally
prohibit
public
commercialized
dissemination
of
pornographic
matter,
absent
distribution
to
minors,
to
non-consenting
adults
or
by
pandering
the
facts
--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that
is
not
the
way
we
read
it
your
honor
and
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
way
the
author
of
the
opinion
wrote
it.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
think
it's
significant
to
get
to
the
second
point
for
the
same
reason
stated
by
my
brother,
the
distinguished
assistant
attorney
general
in
the
immediately
prior
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
submit
respectfully
your
honor
that
there
exists
now
a
great
deal
of
confusion.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
among
lower
court.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
submit
your
honor
that
the
principles
exist
in
roth
versus
the
united
states
and
the
opinions
following
that
and
also
in
stanley
versus
georgia.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that
is
correct,
your
honor
but
in
the
meantime,
we
submit
that
there
exist
a
great
deal
of
confusion
and
a
chilling
effect
among
law
enforcement
officials
as
far
as
the
degree
to
which
they
can
go.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
in
reading
the
statue
--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that's
correct.
our
understanding
your
honor
is
that
the
bill
of
exceptions
was
entered
in
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
yesterday.
so
--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
in
the
ordinary
course,
there
would
be
oral
argument
and
very
likely
in
the
october
sitting
of
the
court
because
of
course
it's
too
late
now
for
this
argument
to
reach
the
may
sitting
--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
the
decision
would
go.
i
submit
that
a
decision
would
go
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
well
as
to
the
question
of
obscenity
vel
non?
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that's
a
fair
assumption
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
would
add
parenthetically
that
if
there
had
been
all
haste
in
the
preparation
of
the
bill
of
exception
so
that
it
might
be
entered
by
the
court,
it's
very
likely
that
this
case
would
have
been
argued
in
the
state
court
at
next
week's
scheduled
arguments
in
the
may
sitting.
the
facts
maybe
stated
briefly
as
follows.
on
june
30,
1969,
after
preliminary
proceedings
not
relevant
here,
appellees
filed
an
amended
complaint
in
the
court
below
alleging
reason
to
believe
that
indictments
would
be
sought
against
them
by
appellant
byrne's
office
under
massachusetts
general
laws,
chapter
272
section
28(a).
shortly
thereafter,
the
indictments
were
in
fact
sought
and
returned.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that
is
correct
your
honor.
after
the
suit
was
filed
but
before
there
was
any
action
taken
if
i
may
say
respectfully,
there
was
a
bit
of
a
raise
to
the
courtroom
doors,
two
courts
involved.
appellees
sought
a
declaration
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
an
injunction
against
prosecution
there
under.
they
alleged
that
the
statute
was
overbroad
because
among
other
things
adequately
controlled
commercial
distribution
of
obscene
material
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
the
court
declined
to
grant
injunctive
or
other
relief
but
requested
briefs
on
questions
regarding
the
scope
of
this
court's
holdings
in
stanley
versus
georgia
and
the
effect
of
that
opinion
on
the
massachusetts
statute.
prosecution
continued
in
the
state
court
in
a
jury
weighed
session
and
the
appellees
were
convicted.
following
their
conviction
appellees
renewed
their
request
for
injunctive
relief.
after
further
argument,
a
majority
of
the
court
below
held
that
stanley
versus
georgia
went
so
far
as
to
prohibit
state
prosecution
with
respect
to
adequately
controlled
public
distribution
of
obscene
material
and
the
court
decided
that
the
massachusetts
statute
was
probably
unconstitutional
as
being
overbroad
on
its
face.
based
on
this
opinion,
a
majority
of
the
court
below
enjoined
the
appellants
from
further
prosecution
with
respect
to
showing
of
the
film
of
i
am
curious
(yellow).
i
address
myself
first
to
the
question,
why
did
the
court
below
abused
its
discretion
in
granting
injunctive
relief?
committee
and
federalism
prompt
the
federal
judge
to
be
extremely
reluctant
to
enjoin
good
faith
enforcement
of
a
state's
criminal
laws
by
law
enforcement
officials.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
respectfully
submit
--
no
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that
is
correct
your
honor,
you
have
and
the
congress
as
legislative
a
distinction
--
legislated
a
distinction
in
that
respect.
but
i
respectfully
submit
that
what
we
have
here
in
the
facts
that
i
suggested
were
not
relevant
to
the
facts
present.what
we
have
here
really
was
the
seeking
of
an
indictment
before
any
approach
to
the
federal
court.
this
indictment
was
subsequently
dismissed
in
the
judgment
of
the
district
attorney
because
there
was
lacking
scienter
in
the
terms
of
the
indictment
and
the
district
attorney
then
in
the
normal
course
of
his
business
proceeded
to
seek
a
new
indictment
including
all
of
the
proper
elements
of
the
crime
so
that
there
would
not
be
a
dismissal
on
a
basis
of
a
technicality.
and
during
the
interim
--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
would
say
within
a
week
of
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
your
honor.
on
june
25th,
the
matter
was
dismissed
on
motion
of
the
district
attorney
in
the
suffolk
superior
court.
on
june
30th,
the
appellees
here
were
in
the
federal
court
and
within
days
there,
there
was
a
process
of
indictment
again
in
the
suffolk
superior
court.
well,
what
have
we
here
to
contravene
that
fundamental
principle
which
i
have
now
stated?
no
monetary
loss
for
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
on
the
record
of
any
financial
loss
on
the
part
of
the
appellees
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
no
proprietary
interest.
they're
not
the
owners
of
this
film.
they
own
a
movie
house
which
shows
this
and
other
films.
we
can
hardly
say
further
--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
think
it
goes
to
the
essence
of
whether
injunctive
relief
can
be
granted
your
honor
whether
there
is
monetary
damage.
we
submit
that
there
was
no
showing
of
monetary
damage
that
simply
stating
that
they
own
a
movie
house
and
they
are
showing
or
might
want
to
show
a
particular
film
is
not
sufficient
showing
of
damage.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
in
one
of
the
briefs,
the
red
brief,
there
is
a
mention
of
the
other
films
that
have
been
shown
since
in
the
judgment
of
the
appellees
here,
they
should
show
other
films.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
don't
know
how,
your
honor.
there
are
great
deal
--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
there
are
great
deal
of
exciting
films,
mr.
justice
marshall.
you
know
many
at
times,
i
attempted
to
go
to
one
of
the
theatres
of
the
appellees
involved
here
and
i've
never
been
able
to
get
inside
the
theater.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
didn't
think
i
look
that
way
mr.
justice.
and
we
can
hardly
say
that
there
is
any
chilling
effect
here
either
on
the
appellees
or
their
patrons.
we
are
not
talking
about
political
handbills.
we
are
talking
about
commercial
pornography
assumptively
in
the
court
below
and
on
a
finding
after
a
trial
in
the
superior
court
of
suffolk
county.
a
subject
matter
assumed
to
be
obscene,
we
submit,
cannot
be
said
to
have
any
value
within
itself.
furthermore,
this
film
showed
for
five-and-a-half
months
pending
the
argument
on
the
merits
and
the
decision
of
obscenity
on
the
facts
in
the
suffolk
superior
court.
we
find
only
one
instance
where
this
court
approved
relief,
granted
against
a
state
law
enforcement
official.
that
was
the
case
of
the
dombrowski
versus
pfister.
it
concerns
civil
rights
advocacy.
the
record
is
replete
with
incidents
of
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
local
officials.
this
is
epitomized
by
the
anecdote
of
night
rage
on
citizen's
officers
which
discouraged
their
protected
activities.
these
are
not
the
facts
in
the
case
of
byrne.
we
have
here
activity
whose
dominant
theme
by
assumption
and
by
a
finding
on
the
facts
after
a
state
trial
is
offensive
to
community
standards
of
morality,
whose
appeal
is
to
a
prurient
interest
in
sex
whose
content
is
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value.
furthermore,
there
is
no
bad
faith
whatsoever
either
evident
on
the
record
or
argued
in
the
court
below
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution
law
enforcement
officials.
this
has
been
accepting
the
instance
that
i've
related
to
you
your
honor,
mr.
justice
brennan.
this
has
been
a
single
case
pursued
in
the
course
of
his
work
by
the
district
attorney
of
suffolk
county.
we
submit
therefore
that
there
is
no
showing
of
irreparable
injury
which
would
prompt
and
support
the
action
taken
by
the
majority
membership
of
the
court
below.
moreover
in
this
case,
we
have
a
classic
example
for
the
application
of
the
principle
of
abstention.
if
the
statute
in
question,
chapter
272,
section
28(a)
of
the
massachusetts
general
laws
should
be
overbroad
and
this
we
do
not
concede.
that
faults
can
here
be
overcome
by
leaving
the
case
to
be
resolved
in
the
state
court
and
giving
the
state
court
the
opportunity
to
narrowly
construe
the
law
and
thus
avoid
constitutional
defects.
and
this
can
be
done
in
a
single
matter
pending
in
the
massachusetts
courts.
assuming
however
that
this
statute
is
--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
why
should
i
not
be
content
to
stop
at
that
point,
mr.
justice
harlan?
i
think
as
i
have
stated
before
that
there
must
be
some
consideration
given
by
this
distinguished
court
to
the
aspect
in
which
our
complete
american
society
finds
itself
as
far
as
the
issue
of
obscenity.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
submit
your
honor
that
it
is
not
without
precedent
that
this
court
has
made
distinctions
and
has
made
findings
as
far
as
the
procedure
in
cases
like
this
where
it
rendered
what
appeared
to
be
sufficient
decision
on
one
part
of
the
case
to
eliminate
consideration
of
the
second
point
but
then
went
on
in
its
judgment
for
proper
interpretation
of
the
law
to
considering
a
second
point.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that
is
correct
your
honor
but
i
submit
that
we
continue
to
have
two
judges
of
three
in
the
three-judge
district
court
in
massachusetts
making
a
decision
of
probable
unconstitutionality.
we
continue
to
have
a
federal
judge
in
california
making
another
decision
of
unconstitutionality
of
a
federal
statute.
we
continue
to
have
that
confusion
that
i
mentioned
before.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
if
that's
the
pleasure
of
the
court,
yes
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
did
not
need
quite
the
hour's
hesitation
to
answer
respectfully,
your
honor.
i
have
no
doubt
in
my
experience
as
attorney
general
that
of
extreme
importance
and
primary
importance
in
consideration
of
this
court
today
is
the
first
point,
that
point
of
abstention
as
far
as
the
court,
three-judge
federal
court
in
its
action
on
this
case.
this
is
of
extreme
importance
to
all
of
us
because
in
addition
to
the
confusion,
it
establishes
in
the
judicial
system
and
in
law
enforcement
administration.
it
also,
i
respectfully
submit,
creates
great
or
a
possibility
of
disrespect
with
the
public
at
large
and
it
is
that
point
additionally
that
makes
it
advisable,
we
submit,
for
the
further
consideration
of
the
problem
of
obscenity
and
for
the
consideration
of
clarifying
exactly
this
court's
views
on
obscenity.
i
go
now
to
another
factor
relied
on
in
the
majority
opinion
below
because
it
leads
to
the
second
question
presented
in
our
case
here.
that
court
gave
great
weight
to
the
likelihood
of
success
for
the
appellees
here
in
their
posture
on
the
facts.
that
success
depends
on
the
answer
to
the
question,
“can
public
commercial
dissemination
of
pornography
be
proscribed
by
any
state?”
before
stanley
versus
georgia,
we
submit
that
there
was
no
doubt
at
all
above
this
principle.
roth
versus
the
united
states,
the
leading
case
on
this
subject
based
that
answer
on
the
fact
that
obscenity
is
not
protected
speech
within
the
first
amendment.
we
agree
with
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
holding
in
stanley
in
no
way
impairs
the
principle
so
well
annunciated
in
roth.
in
fact,
only
last
week,
this
court
summarily
affirmed
in
gable
versus
jenkins
number
1049
on
the
docket
of
the
court,
a
case
involving
action
under
a
distinguishable
statute
in
the
same
jurisdiction
as
stanley.
distinguishable
from
the
statute
in
the
stanley
case
but
a
statute
very
much
like
that
upheld
in
the
roth
case
and
very
much
like
the
statute
under
consideration
in
the
case
at
bar.
the
statute
upheld
in
roth
prohibited
commercial
distribution
of
pornography.
the
massachusetts
statute,
chapter
272,
section
28(a)
is
of
like
tenet.
it
strikes
at
public
dissemination.
this,
we
submit,
does
not
affect
a
fact
situation
like
that
present
in
stanley
versus
georgia.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
it
was
a
summary
affirmance,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
gable
versus
jenkins,
number
1049.
as
i
recall,
i
think
there
were
two
justices
either
abstaining
or
dissenting,
your
honor.
for
all
of
the
foregoing
reasons
that
i
have
brought
forth
--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
1049
your
honor.
i'm
aware
that
the
solicitor
general
is
going
to
take
some
time
of
the
honorable
court
and
will
dwell
exclusively
on
the
issue
of
obscenity
and
the
relationship
between
the
roth
decision
and
those
following
it
and
stanley
versus
georgia.
so
i
will
conclude,
submitting
that
for
all
of
the
foregoing
and
for
the
reasons
brought
forth
in
our
brief,
we
submit
that
the
court
below
abused
its
discretion
in
granting
relief
and
should
be
reversed
on
that
instance.
we
also
submit
that
the
right
to
prohibit
obscenity,
that
right
annunciated
in
roth
and
the
right
to
possess
obscene
matter
in
the
privacy
of
one's
home
that
right
protected
in
stanley
are
compatible
as
this
court
has
held.
and
that
therefore,
the
massachusetts
statute
is
constitutional.
we
asked
this
honorable
court
so
to
hold
and
add
again
if
i
may
be
able
to
do
so
a
special
plea
on
behalf
of
the
judicial
systems
of
the
several
states,
the
enforcement
officials
and
the
legislatures
of
those
several
states
that
this
honorable
court
make
that
latter
point
clear.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
think
that
this
court
here
could
consider
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
submit
that
we
do
have
here
a
commercial
aspect.
this
is
the
appellees
here
in
question
where
the
owners
and
the
manager
and
the
corporate
owner
of
a
movie
house
so
that
there
is
sufficient
here
for
the
court
with
other
cases
presently
under
consideration
there
is
sufficient
here
for
the
court
to
elaborate
on
what
we
find
in
stanley
versus
georgia.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
respectfully
submit
your
honor
that
this
is
basic
to
the
question
of
obscenity
no
matter
where
the
issue
is
applied.
i'm
well
aware
of
the
position
of
your
honor
regarding
obscenity
but
there
is
another
opinion
and
there
is
an
opinion
supported
by
actions
of
the
legislatures
of
the
several
states
as
well
as
the
united
sates
congress
which
has
proscribed
obscenity
and
there
is
support
in
legal
opinion
that
suggests
that
obscenity
in
its
reference
may
properly
continue
to
be
difficult
a
specific
definition
and
specific
application
as
has
been
stated
by
one
justice
i
know
it
when
i
see
it.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
do
so
your
honor
and
this
is
another
reason
why
further
clarification
of
the
distinctions
made
by
this
court
would
be
helpful
to
all
of
us
who
are
in
society
and
in
law
enforcement.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
respectfully.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
must
answer
in
the
affirmative
to
all
of
these
disjunctives,
your
honor.
there
is
an
evidentiary
problem
in
determining
obscenity
or
not.
this
is
the
case
that
was
tried
in
this
particular
matter
in
the
state
court.
there
is
also
of
course
the
overview
of
this
honorable
court
as
far
as
the
extent
to
which
the
factual
problem
of
obscenity
goes
and
constantly,
we
have
seen
cases
brought
before
here
arguing
the
issue
of
obscenity
on
a
given
set
of
facts.
fortunately,
that
is
not
the
case
here.
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that's
one
of
the
tests,
yes
your
honor.
how
this
is
established
is
extremely
difficult
i'm
sure
for
the
court
as
well
as
for
individual
late
people,
citizens
of
unite
states
of
america.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
well
stated,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
in
massachusetts,
we
always
thought
that
20
miles
an
hour
was
a
reasonable
speed
practically
anyway,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
all
agree
that
we
have
difficulty
with
the
definition
of
obscenity.
i
must
confess
now.
i
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
with
the
definition
of
the
word
“threat”.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
threat,
your
honor.
after
five-and-a-half
months
of
showing
of
the
film
by
the
appellees
here,
“i
am
curious
(yellow),”
after
a
trial
in
the
merits
in
superior
court
lasting
days
not
suddenly
in
a
colloquy
in
the
federal
court,
the
district
attorney
declines
to
renew
a
stipulation
which
he
made
previously
that
he
would
not
seek
further
prosecution
or
seek
to
enjoin
the
showing
of
this
film
until
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
in
the
merits.
this
--
this
is
all
called
threats.
this
is
all
called
job
owning.
this
is
all
called
multiple
prosecutions.
this
is
called
dombrowski
a
fortiori.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
pardon
my
latin,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
this
is
called
dombrowski
a
fortiori,
i
submit,
it
is
neither
a
fortiori
although
weaker.
it
is
completely
not
the
case.
the
record
shows
no
evidence
of
threats
whatsoever
but
simply
a
declination
to
renew
a
stipulation
by
the
district
attorney.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
submit
that
however
we
interpret
or
define
threat
that
cannot
be
held
to
be
a
threat
legally
in
the
english
language
or
even
in
the
swedish
language.
further,
we
must
accept
the
fact
that
my
brother
has
conceded
that
there
has
never
been
an
effort
made
in
the
state
courts
of
massachusetts
to
continue
the
showing
of
this
film.
i
submit
in
conclusion
that
the
appellees
here
are
not
grove
press,
inc.
the
appellees
here
are
film
distributors.
the
action
on
the
part
of
the
appellants
has
never
under
any
color
or
interpretation
of
that
action
been
able
to
be
defined
as
threats
or
anywhere
near
the
fact
of
situation
existing
in
dombrowski
versus
pfister.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
and
the
bill
of
exceptions
was
entered
yesterday
in
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
which
leads
us
to
the
safe
assumption
that
this
court,
this
case
will
be
argued
on
the
merits
in
massachusetts
in
the
october
sitting.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
our
massachusetts
supreme
court
has
a
tradition
of
never
having
to
let
the
year
pass
without
deciding
all
of
the
cases
that
were
argued
before
and
i
think
it's
safe
to
assume
that
within
a
month
or
two
after
the
oral
argument
that
there'd
be
a
decision
on
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
here
on
appeal
from
an
interlocutory
order
of
the
united
states
district
court,
for
the
district
of
massachusetts,
under
the
provisions
of
28
united
states
code
1253.
that
provides
for
direct
appeal
from
an
order
or
judgment
of
a
three-judge
court
granting
temporary
injunctive
relief
against
enforcement
of
a
state
statute.
in
our
view,
this
appeal
presents
two
equally
important
issues,
which
ought
to
be
finally
resolved
by
this
court.
the
first
is
whether
the
court
below
abused
its
discretion
in
enjoining
the
district
attorney
from
prosecuting
in
the
future
on
account
of
the
showing
of
the
film,
“i
am
curious
yellow,”
which
the
court
below
assumed
to
be
obscene.
the
second
is
whether
under
this
court’s
holding
in
stanley
versus
georgia,
any
state
can
constitutionally
prohibit
public,
commercialized
dissemination
of
pornographic
matter,
absent
distribution
to
minors,
non-consenting
adults,
or
by
pandering.
the
facts
maybe
stated
briefly
as
follows:
on
june
30,
1969,
after
preliminary
proceedings
not
relevant
here,
the
appellees
filed
an
amended
complaint
in
the
court
below,
alleging
reason
to
believe
that
indictments
would
be
sought
against
them,
by
appellant
byrnes
office,
under
massachusetts
general
laws,
chapter
272,
section
28
(a).
shortly
thereafter,
the
indictments
were
in
fact
sought
and
returned.
appellees
saw
the
declaration
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
that
injunction
against
prosecution
there
under.
they
alleged
the
statute
was
overbroad,
because
among
other
things,
adequately
controlled
commercial
distribution
of
obscene
material
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
the
court
declined
to
grant
injunctive
or
other
relief,
but
requested
briefs
on
the
questions
regarding
the
scope
of
this
court’s
holding,
in
stanley
versus
georgia.
and
the
effect
of
that
opinion
on
the
massachusetts
statute,
prosecution
continued
in
the
state
court,
in
a
jury
waived
session
and
the
appellees
were
convicted.
following
their
conviction,
the
appellees
renewed
their
request
for
injunctive
relief.
after
further
argument,
a
majority
of
the
court
below
held
that
stanley
versus
georgia
went
so
far
as
to
prohibit
state
prosecutions,
with
respect
to
adequately
controlled
public
distribution
of
obscene
material.
and
the
court
decided
that
the
massachusetts
statute
was
probably
unconstitutional
as
being
overbroad
on
its
face.
based
on
this
opinion,
a
majority
of
the
court
below
enjoined
the
appellants
from
further
prosecution
with
respect
to
showing
of
the
film,
i’m
curious
yellow.”
this
matter
was
argued
before
this
honorable
court
on
april
38th
and
subsequently
ordered
for
re-argument.
in
the
meantime,
the
appellees’
appeal
was
entered
in
the
state
court.
oral
argument
in
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
has
been
delayed,
pending
a
motion
for
postponement
filed
by
the
appellees
here.
i
address
myself
first
to
the
question,
whether
the
court
below
abused
its
discretion
in
granting
injunctive
relief.
comity
and
federalism
prompt
a
federal
judge
to
be
extremely
reluctant
to
enjoin
good
faith
enforcement
of
a
state’s
criminal
laws
by
that
state's
law
enforcement
officials.
what
have
we
here
to
contravene
that
fundamental
principle?
no
monetary
loss.
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
of
any
financial
loss
on
the
part
of
appellees
here.
they
had
no
proprietary
interest
in
the
subject
matter.
they’re
not
the
owners
of
a
film.
rather
they
own
a
movie
house.
there's
no
chilling
effect
either
on
the
appelles
or
their
patrons.
these
are
not
politically
hand
bills,
but
commercial
pornography.
assumptively
in
the
court
below
and
after
a
finding
in
a
trial,
a
subject
matter
assumed
to
be
obscene,
we
submit.
all
the
more
so
is
subject
matter
found
in
a
trial
below
to
be
obscene,
cannot
be
said
to
have
any
value
within
itself.
this
film
further
showed
for
five-and-a-half
months,
pending
the
argument
on
the
merits
and
the
decision
of
obscenity
on
the
facts,
in
a
trial,
in
the
suffolk
superior
court
in
massachusetts.
we’ve
been
only
able
to
find
one
instance,
where
this
court
approved
relief
granted
against
a
state
law
enforcement
official.
that
is
of
course,
the
decision
in
dombrowski
versus
pfister
in
380
united
states
479.
the
dombrowski
case
was
a
matter
of
civil
rights
advocacy.
it's
record
is
replete
with
incidence
of
bad
faith,
for
example
night
raids,
made
by
law
enforcement
officials
on
the
offices
and
the
homes
of
individuals
involved.
we
have
none
of
that
here.
here
we
have
first
of
all,
activity
whose
dominant
theme
is
offensive
to
community
standards
of
morality,
whose
appeal
is
to
a
prurient
interest
in
sex,
whose
content
is
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value.
here
we
have
no
bad
faith,
either
on
the
record,
or
argued
below
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution
or
law
enforcement
officials.
this
has
been
a
single
case,
pursued
by
the
district
attorney
in
suffolk
county,
in
the
course
of
his
work
as
the
elected
district
attorney
of
the
people,
pursued
while
the
film
showing
by
the
appellees
in
their
theater
continued
for
five-and-a-half
months.
here,
we
submit
is
a
classic
example
for
the
application
of
the
principle
of
abstention.
if
the
statute,
chapter
272,
section
28
(a)
of
the
massachusetts
general
laws,
should
be
overbroad,
and
we
do
not
concede
this,
that’s
fault
here
can
be
overcome
by
leaving
the
case
to
be
resolved
in
the
state
court.
and
by
giving
the
state
court
the
opportunity
to
narrowly
construe
the
law
and
thus,
avoid
any
constitutional
defect.
this
can
be--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
the
proceedings
below
have
been
staid,
your
honor,
pending
or
are
subsequent
to
a
motion
by
the
appellees
that
the
oral
argument
on
this
case
be
postponed
until
the
decision
in
this
court
was
made
on
the
issue
of
obscenity,
generally.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
there
was
a
conviction
in
suffolk
county
superior
court.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
appeal
was
prosecuted
to
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court,
that
argument,
i
believe
would
have
been
made
orally
before
the
court
in
the
first
week
of
october,
but
sometime
in
september,
i
think
september
16th,
the
motion
was
filed
by
the
appellees
here
for
postponement.
postponement
on
the
issue
of
whether
obscenity
can
be
proscribed
any
longer
by
any
state
court,
a
decision
by
this
court
and--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
postponement
of
the
oral
argument,
as
far
as
that
is
concerned
and
we
assent
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that’s
what
the
honorable
court
decided
that
if
there
was
going
to
be
any
postponement
at
all,
it
would
be
a
postponement
of
the
complete
oral
argument.
they
would
not
separate
the
issues
involved
in
one
case.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
believe
it
has
been
by
formal
order,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
yes
sir,
on
the
motion
of
the
appellees
here.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
we
did
not,
we
assented
to
the
motion
provided
that
the
issues
not
be
divided,
but
the
case
be
taken
as
a
whole.
we
had
no
objection
either
to
arguing
the
total
case
as
a
whole
in
october
or
to
postponing
the
oral
argument
on
the
total
case,
until
some
decision
should
be
made
by
this
honorable
court.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
none
whatsoever
your
honor.
only
the
motion
affirming
the
action
taken.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that’s
correct.
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
on
notice
by
both
parties,
i
think
that
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
would
schedule
a
case
for
oral
argument
at
the
earliest
convenient
date.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
think
that
if
pending
a
visit
by
the
appelles
and
the
appellants
here,
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts,
the
court
would
immediately
schedule
that
case
for
oral
argument
there.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
it
does
not
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
it
does
not
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that
is
correct
your
honor,
on
whether
as
i've
said
in
the
second
issue,
to
be
considered
by
the
court,
whether
under
the
court’s
holding
in
stanley
versus
georgia,
any
state
can
constitutionally
prohibit
the
public
commercialized
dissemination
of
pornographic
matter,
without
any
consideration
to
this
distribution
being
to
minors,
or
non-consenting
adults
or
by
pandering.
and
i
have
addressed
myself
to
the
first
argument,
which
i
believe
is
basic
to
my
appearance
before
this
honorable
court,
that
of
whether
the
court
below
abused
its
discretion
in
enjoining
the
district
attorney
from
prosecuting
in
the
future
on
account
of
showing
of
a
film,
which
has
been
adjudged
by
a
competent
court
as
obscene.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that
is
true
your
honor,
unless
the
court
in
its--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
think
last
week,
this
honorable
court
heard
a
lot
of
arguments
on
the
merits
of
that
film
and
on
the
issue
of
proscribing
obscenity,
that’s
correct,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
have
suggested
that
in
this
case
pending,
we
have
the
classic
example
for
the
application
of
the
principle
of
abstention,
by
this
court.
we
further
submit
that
if
chapter
272,
section
28
(a),
should
be
read
to
be
overbroad
in
the
light
of
the
most
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
in
stanley
versus
georgia,
that
that
fault
could
be
overcome
by
a
decision
and
by
a
narrow
construction
made
in
that
decision,
by
our
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
in
the
single
case,
now
pending
before
the
court.
this
would
avoid
the
constitutional
defect.
and
it
would
further
avoid
any
possible
irritant
to
the
federal
state
relationship,
which
is
a
matter
of
grave
concern
to
this
court,
and
a
matter
of
grave
concern
to
all
of
us
in
the
field
of
criminal
justice
administration
in
the
united
states
of
america.
were
we
to
assume
that
the
statutory
validity
of
the
massachusetts
law
is
affected
by
stanley
versus
georgia?
we
think
this
court
ought
to
leave
for
the
state
and
its
court
to
interpret
and
to
limit
the
application
of
the
state
statute,
within
that
holding
of
stanley
versus
georgia.
similarly,
as
this
honorable
court
itself
has
subsequently
limited
the
application
of
stanley
versus
georgia.
my
brother,
the
solicitor
general
will
discuss
the
substance
of
the
second
issue,
which
we
have
touched
upon
in
the
questions
put
before
me,
that
relating
to
the
constitutional
right
of
any
state
or
any
government
to
proscribe
obscenity
within
the
framework
of
the
first
amendment
to
our
united
states
constitution.
i
respectfully
submit
again
that
this
court
has
heard
many
arguments
on
this
issue
that
during
this
term,
as
well
as
the
term
before.
and
i
will
leave
the
burden
of
that
argument
to
my
brother,
the
solicitor
general.
for
these
reasons,
it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
very
briefly,
i
choose
to
touch
upon
three
items
which
i
think
have
been
a
part
of
the
appellees
argument.
the
first
relates
to
what
i
think
has
been
referred
to
as
a
novel
approach
for
law
enforcement
in
the
field
of
obscenity.
the
suggestion
is
of
course.
that
a
customs
case
in
the
second
circuit
is
one
that
ought
to
invite
the
interest
of
every
state
law
enforcement
official.
this,
i
respectfully
submit
is
one
aspect
or
one
approach
to
law
enforcement
of
which
i
want
no
part
whatsoever.
for
the
first
reason,
i
don’t
know
how
a
state
could
intervene
into
a
federal
customs
case.
i
know
of
no
provision
that
would
entitle
any
of
us
who
might
be
states
attorney’s
general
or
district
attorney’s
to
step
into
this
court
to
be
ultimately
bound.
for
another
reason,
i
am
not
prepared
anymore
than
any
other
individual
in
this
courtroom
to
make
the
assumption
that
some
imported
film
or
other
item
is
obscene
or
ought
to
have
my
supervision
immediately
on
its
importation
to
be
obscene.
i
think
first
any
one
of
us
in
law
enforcement
would
have
to
have
an
opportunity
to
make
a
judgment
on
the
facts
would
have
to
see
the
film
as
in
this
case
in
our
jurisdiction.
it
should
not
be
asked
either
to
come
in
out
of
curiosity
to
another
jurisdiction
or
another
court
or
to
come
in
on
notice
or
in
any
binding
effect
of
that
particular
decision.
on
the
contrary,
in
this
particular
case,
there
must
have
been
some
assumption
to
the
validity
of
the
particular
act
which
is
the
showing
of
the
film
until
there
was
a
contrary
decision
made
and
this
is
exactly
what
occurred
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts.
there
was
an
allegation
or
complaint
and
indictment,
one
single
action
taken
by
a
qualified
law
enforcement
official
of
suffolk
county.
there
were
many
arguments
and
there
was
a
hearing.
there
was
a
trial
conducted.
and
this
covered
a
period
of
five-and-a-half
months
when
the
particular
film
in
question
showed,
when
there
was
no
chill
whatsoever
on
any
citizen’s
rights.
whether
the
appellees
here
or
any
viewers
as
far
as
their
opportunity
to
observe
the
film
“i
am
curious
yellow”
which
two
judges
out
of
three
and
the
second
circuit
court
determined
was
not
obscene.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
from
the
beginning
of
the
--
from
the
spring
of
1969
mr.
justice
stewart,
which
i
think
was
probably
in
may
and
then
an
indictment
was
sought
some
time
around
the
last
week
of
june
by
the
district
attorney
of
suffolk
county
and
there
was
no
--
there
was
action
then
taken
by
the
appellees
in
the
federal
court
but
there
was
no
controlling
action
taken
by
the
federal
court
nor
was
there
any
other
action
taken
by
the
district
attorney
of
suffolk
county.
just
one
single
indictment
and
during
the
time
when
these
arguments
ensued
and
when
the
trial
on
the
issue
was
held
in
a
jury
waived
session
in
suffolk
superior
court,
that
covered
a
period
of
five-and-a-half
months.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
there
is
not
that
remedy
available
to
the
prosecutor
but
there
is
the
remedy
of
declaratory
judgment
which
was
an
approach
endorsed
by
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
in
its
decision
of
commonwealth
versus
baird
where
these
first
amendment
issues
are
brought
into
focus.
and
there
has
been
other
precedent
in
the
massachusetts
court
system
for
act
of
approach
taken
by
anyone
asserting
his
individual
rights.
so
this
film
showed
for
five-and-a-half
months
in
the
massachusetts
jurisdiction
not
withstanding
the
district
attorney
of
suffolk
county
had
no
opportunity
to
appear
in
the
second
circuit.
of
course,
implicit
in
this
is
the
fact
that
we
cannot
assume
that
there
were
any
threats
on
the
part
of
the
district
attorney
of
suffolk
county
or
the
attorney
general
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
during
this
five-and-a-half
month
period.
there
were
no
threats
and
i
further
suggest
that
a
threat
connotes
illegal
action
on
the
part
of
a
state
law
enforcement
official.
well,
there
was
only
one
single
action
taken
during
this
five-and-a-half
month
period.
there
has
been
no
action
taken
by
the
district
attorney
since
that
period,
only
the
fact
that
he
will
not
pledge
to
undergo
no
further
prosecutions,
should
this
film
be
shown.
though
there
was
the
forbearance
on
the
part
of
the
appellees
here,
after
the
finding
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
after
a
finding
by
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
in
suffolk
county
that
there
is
obscenity.
that
any
prosecuting
official,
any
law
enforcement
official
who
should
take
a
pledge
that
he
would
not
move
against
the
film
found
in
fact
to
be
obscene
in
his
jurisdiction
would
not
be
upholding
his
sworn
duty
to
administer
the
law
and
to
prosecute
crime
but
there
was
no
such
statement
made
only
that
a
change
had
occurred.
this
was
after
the
five-and-a-half
month
showing.
this
was
after
a
finding
of
obscenity.
this
was
after
i
respectfully
submit,
a
removal
of
that
presumption
which
must
have
existed
on
the
part
of
individuals.
on
the
basis
of
the
decision,
the
2:1
decision
in
the
second
circuit.
i
further
suggest
to
this
honorable
court
what
else
is
a
law
enforcement
official
to
do
as
far
as
these
cases
are
concerned,
if
over
his
shoulder
constantly
is
--
i
would
not
use
the
threat
but
is
the
possibility
of
federal
court
intervention
in
every
action
that
might
be
under
taken
by
that
state
law
enforcement
official
in
good
faith,
in
the
pursuance
of
his
duty?
what
else
is
he
to
do
but
stand
still
and
i
submit,
let
something
now
presumptively
a
crime
continued
to
be
perpetuated
within
his
jurisdiction.
i
would
further
suggest
that
if
we
are
to
remove
the
very
pressing
issue
of
obscenity
from
determinations
by
this
court
or
by
any
individual
citizen,
nobody
has
seriously
suggested
that
i
have
heard
that
we
not
continue
to
apply
the
limitations
which
were
mentioned
in
the
provisos
in
the
injunction
by
the
court
below.
those
limitations
that
provided
this
injunction
shall
not
apply
if
the
picture
is
advertised
in
a
manner
pandering
to
prurient
interest
in
sex
or
is
shown
to
an
audience
not
warned
of
its
possibly
offensive
character,
or
is
shown
to
children
under
the
age
of
18
years,
i
respectfully
submit
that
more
constitutional
issues
could
be
raised
in
any
one
of
these
three
classifications
than
i
raise
in
the
whole
issue
of
what
is
obscene
and
not
obscene
under
the
context
of
definitions
of
obscenity
as
outlined
by
this
court
in
roth
versus
the
united
states.
we
would
have
to
wonder
what
size
ad
newspaper
add
was
advertising
in
a
manner
pandering
to
prurient
interest.
we’d
have
to
wonder,
if
showing
the
film
in
disney
land
with
all
the
cautions
in
the
world
was
nevertheless
a
failure
to
warn
a
possible
offensive
character.
we
would
have
to
wonder
if
some
young
people
in
these
united
states
who
come
from,
for
example,
the
mediterranean
countries
in
the
heritage
as
my
own
wife
does,
should
not
be
allowed
a
greater
degree
of
maturity
than
age
18
or
than
those
individuals
of
my
own
heritage
who
might
have
come
from
northern
european
countries.
no,
i
hardly
think
that
removing
obscenity
as
proscribed
conduct
could
remove
the
problems
that
beset
law
enforcement
officials
and
this
honorable
court
alike
in
the
area
of
obscenity.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
here
on
appeal
from
an
interlocutory
order
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts
under
the
provisions
of
28
u.s.c
1253.
that
provides
for
direct
appeal
from
an
order
or
judgment
of
a
three-judge
court
granting
temporary
injunctive
relief
against
the
enforcement
of
a
state
statute.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
our
view,
this
appeal
presents
two
equally
important
issues
which
ought
to
be
finally
resolved
by
this
court.
the
first
is
whether
the
court
below
abused
its
discretion
in
enjoining
the
district
attorney
from
prosecuting
in
the
future
on
account
on
the
showing
off
the
film
“i
am
curious
(yellow)”,
which
the
court
below
assumed
to
be
obscene.
the
second
is
whether
under
this
court's
holding
in
stanley
versus
georgia
any
state
to
unconstitutionally
prohibit
public
commercialized
dissemination
of
pornographic
matter,
absent
distribution
to
minors,
to
non-consenting
adults
or
by
pandering
the
facts
--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that
is
not
the
way
we
read
it
your
honor
and
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
way
the
author
of
the
opinion
wrote
it.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
think
it's
significant
to
get
to
the
second
point
for
the
same
reason
stated
by
my
brother,
the
distinguished
assistant
attorney
general
in
the
immediately
prior
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
submit
respectfully
your
honor
that
there
exists
now
a
great
deal
of
confusion.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
among
lower
court.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
submit
your
honor
that
the
principles
exist
in
roth
versus
the
united
states
and
the
opinions
following
that
and
also
in
stanley
versus
georgia.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that
is
correct,
your
honor
but
in
the
meantime,
we
submit
that
there
exist
a
great
deal
of
confusion
and
a
chilling
effect
among
law
enforcement
officials
as
far
as
the
degree
to
which
they
can
go.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
in
reading
the
statue
--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that's
correct.
our
understanding
your
honor
is
that
the
bill
of
exceptions
was
entered
in
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
yesterday.
so
--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
in
the
ordinary
course,
there
would
be
oral
argument
and
very
likely
in
the
october
sitting
of
the
court
because
of
course
it's
too
late
now
for
this
argument
to
reach
the
may
sitting
--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
the
decision
would
go.
i
submit
that
a
decision
would
go
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
well
as
to
the
question
of
obscenity
vel
non?
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that's
a
fair
assumption
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
would
add
parenthetically
that
if
there
had
been
all
haste
in
the
preparation
of
the
bill
of
exception
so
that
it
might
be
entered
by
the
court,
it's
very
likely
that
this
case
would
have
been
argued
in
the
state
court
at
next
week's
scheduled
arguments
in
the
may
sitting.
the
facts
maybe
stated
briefly
as
follows.
on
june
30,
1969,
after
preliminary
proceedings
not
relevant
here,
appellees
filed
an
amended
complaint
in
the
court
below
alleging
reason
to
believe
that
indictments
would
be
sought
against
them
by
appellant
byrne's
office
under
massachusetts
general
laws,
chapter
272
section
28(a).
shortly
thereafter,
the
indictments
were
in
fact
sought
and
returned.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that
is
correct
your
honor.
after
the
suit
was
filed
but
before
there
was
any
action
taken
if
i
may
say
respectfully,
there
was
a
bit
of
a
raise
to
the
courtroom
doors,
two
courts
involved.
appellees
sought
a
declaration
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
an
injunction
against
prosecution
there
under.
they
alleged
that
the
statute
was
overbroad
because
among
other
things
adequately
controlled
commercial
distribution
of
obscene
material
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
the
court
declined
to
grant
injunctive
or
other
relief
but
requested
briefs
on
questions
regarding
the
scope
of
this
court's
holdings
in
stanley
versus
georgia
and
the
effect
of
that
opinion
on
the
massachusetts
statute.
prosecution
continued
in
the
state
court
in
a
jury
weighed
session
and
the
appellees
were
convicted.
following
their
conviction
appellees
renewed
their
request
for
injunctive
relief.
after
further
argument,
a
majority
of
the
court
below
held
that
stanley
versus
georgia
went
so
far
as
to
prohibit
state
prosecution
with
respect
to
adequately
controlled
public
distribution
of
obscene
material
and
the
court
decided
that
the
massachusetts
statute
was
probably
unconstitutional
as
being
overbroad
on
its
face.
based
on
this
opinion,
a
majority
of
the
court
below
enjoined
the
appellants
from
further
prosecution
with
respect
to
showing
of
the
film
of
i
am
curious
(yellow).
i
address
myself
first
to
the
question,
why
did
the
court
below
abused
its
discretion
in
granting
injunctive
relief?
committee
and
federalism
prompt
the
federal
judge
to
be
extremely
reluctant
to
enjoin
good
faith
enforcement
of
a
state's
criminal
laws
by
law
enforcement
officials.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
respectfully
submit
--
no
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that
is
correct
your
honor,
you
have
and
the
congress
as
legislative
a
distinction
--
legislated
a
distinction
in
that
respect.
but
i
respectfully
submit
that
what
we
have
here
in
the
facts
that
i
suggested
were
not
relevant
to
the
facts
present.what
we
have
here
really
was
the
seeking
of
an
indictment
before
any
approach
to
the
federal
court.
this
indictment
was
subsequently
dismissed
in
the
judgment
of
the
district
attorney
because
there
was
lacking
scienter
in
the
terms
of
the
indictment
and
the
district
attorney
then
in
the
normal
course
of
his
business
proceeded
to
seek
a
new
indictment
including
all
of
the
proper
elements
of
the
crime
so
that
there
would
not
be
a
dismissal
on
a
basis
of
a
technicality.
and
during
the
interim
--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
would
say
within
a
week
of
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
your
honor.
on
june
25th,
the
matter
was
dismissed
on
motion
of
the
district
attorney
in
the
suffolk
superior
court.
on
june
30th,
the
appellees
here
were
in
the
federal
court
and
within
days
there,
there
was
a
process
of
indictment
again
in
the
suffolk
superior
court.
well,
what
have
we
here
to
contravene
that
fundamental
principle
which
i
have
now
stated?
no
monetary
loss
for
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
on
the
record
of
any
financial
loss
on
the
part
of
the
appellees
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
no
proprietary
interest.
they're
not
the
owners
of
this
film.
they
own
a
movie
house
which
shows
this
and
other
films.
we
can
hardly
say
further
--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
think
it
goes
to
the
essence
of
whether
injunctive
relief
can
be
granted
your
honor
whether
there
is
monetary
damage.
we
submit
that
there
was
no
showing
of
monetary
damage
that
simply
stating
that
they
own
a
movie
house
and
they
are
showing
or
might
want
to
show
a
particular
film
is
not
sufficient
showing
of
damage.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
in
one
of
the
briefs,
the
red
brief,
there
is
a
mention
of
the
other
films
that
have
been
shown
since
in
the
judgment
of
the
appellees
here,
they
should
show
other
films.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
don't
know
how,
your
honor.
there
are
great
deal
--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
there
are
great
deal
of
exciting
films,
mr.
justice
marshall.
you
know
many
at
times,
i
attempted
to
go
to
one
of
the
theatres
of
the
appellees
involved
here
and
i've
never
been
able
to
get
inside
the
theater.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
didn't
think
i
look
that
way
mr.
justice.
and
we
can
hardly
say
that
there
is
any
chilling
effect
here
either
on
the
appellees
or
their
patrons.
we
are
not
talking
about
political
handbills.
we
are
talking
about
commercial
pornography
assumptively
in
the
court
below
and
on
a
finding
after
a
trial
in
the
superior
court
of
suffolk
county.
a
subject
matter
assumed
to
be
obscene,
we
submit,
cannot
be
said
to
have
any
value
within
itself.
furthermore,
this
film
showed
for
five-and-a-half
months
pending
the
argument
on
the
merits
and
the
decision
of
obscenity
on
the
facts
in
the
suffolk
superior
court.
we
find
only
one
instance
where
this
court
approved
relief,
granted
against
a
state
law
enforcement
official.
that
was
the
case
of
the
dombrowski
versus
pfister.
it
concerns
civil
rights
advocacy.
the
record
is
replete
with
incidents
of
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
local
officials.
this
is
epitomized
by
the
anecdote
of
night
rage
on
citizen's
officers
which
discouraged
their
protected
activities.
these
are
not
the
facts
in
the
case
of
byrne.
we
have
here
activity
whose
dominant
theme
by
assumption
and
by
a
finding
on
the
facts
after
a
state
trial
is
offensive
to
community
standards
of
morality,
whose
appeal
is
to
a
prurient
interest
in
sex
whose
content
is
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value.
furthermore,
there
is
no
bad
faith
whatsoever
either
evident
on
the
record
or
argued
in
the
court
below
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution
law
enforcement
officials.
this
has
been
accepting
the
instance
that
i've
related
to
you
your
honor,
mr.
justice
brennan.
this
has
been
a
single
case
pursued
in
the
course
of
his
work
by
the
district
attorney
of
suffolk
county.
we
submit
therefore
that
there
is
no
showing
of
irreparable
injury
which
would
prompt
and
support
the
action
taken
by
the
majority
membership
of
the
court
below.
moreover
in
this
case,
we
have
a
classic
example
for
the
application
of
the
principle
of
abstention.
if
the
statute
in
question,
chapter
272,
section
28(a)
of
the
massachusetts
general
laws
should
be
overbroad
and
this
we
do
not
concede.
that
faults
can
here
be
overcome
by
leaving
the
case
to
be
resolved
in
the
state
court
and
giving
the
state
court
the
opportunity
to
narrowly
construe
the
law
and
thus
avoid
constitutional
defects.
and
this
can
be
done
in
a
single
matter
pending
in
the
massachusetts
courts.
assuming
however
that
this
statute
is
--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
why
should
i
not
be
content
to
stop
at
that
point,
mr.
justice
harlan?
i
think
as
i
have
stated
before
that
there
must
be
some
consideration
given
by
this
distinguished
court
to
the
aspect
in
which
our
complete
american
society
finds
itself
as
far
as
the
issue
of
obscenity.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
submit
your
honor
that
it
is
not
without
precedent
that
this
court
has
made
distinctions
and
has
made
findings
as
far
as
the
procedure
in
cases
like
this
where
it
rendered
what
appeared
to
be
sufficient
decision
on
one
part
of
the
case
to
eliminate
consideration
of
the
second
point
but
then
went
on
in
its
judgment
for
proper
interpretation
of
the
law
to
considering
a
second
point.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that
is
correct
your
honor
but
i
submit
that
we
continue
to
have
two
judges
of
three
in
the
three-judge
district
court
in
massachusetts
making
a
decision
of
probable
unconstitutionality.
we
continue
to
have
a
federal
judge
in
california
making
another
decision
of
unconstitutionality
of
a
federal
statute.
we
continue
to
have
that
confusion
that
i
mentioned
before.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
if
that's
the
pleasure
of
the
court,
yes
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
did
not
need
quite
the
hour's
hesitation
to
answer
respectfully,
your
honor.
i
have
no
doubt
in
my
experience
as
attorney
general
that
of
extreme
importance
and
primary
importance
in
consideration
of
this
court
today
is
the
first
point,
that
point
of
abstention
as
far
as
the
court,
three-judge
federal
court
in
its
action
on
this
case.
this
is
of
extreme
importance
to
all
of
us
because
in
addition
to
the
confusion,
it
establishes
in
the
judicial
system
and
in
law
enforcement
administration.
it
also,
i
respectfully
submit,
creates
great
or
a
possibility
of
disrespect
with
the
public
at
large
and
it
is
that
point
additionally
that
makes
it
advisable,
we
submit,
for
the
further
consideration
of
the
problem
of
obscenity
and
for
the
consideration
of
clarifying
exactly
this
court's
views
on
obscenity.
i
go
now
to
another
factor
relied
on
in
the
majority
opinion
below
because
it
leads
to
the
second
question
presented
in
our
case
here.
that
court
gave
great
weight
to
the
likelihood
of
success
for
the
appellees
here
in
their
posture
on
the
facts.
that
success
depends
on
the
answer
to
the
question,
“can
public
commercial
dissemination
of
pornography
be
proscribed
by
any
state?”
before
stanley
versus
georgia,
we
submit
that
there
was
no
doubt
at
all
above
this
principle.
roth
versus
the
united
states,
the
leading
case
on
this
subject
based
that
answer
on
the
fact
that
obscenity
is
not
protected
speech
within
the
first
amendment.
we
agree
with
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
holding
in
stanley
in
no
way
impairs
the
principle
so
well
annunciated
in
roth.
in
fact,
only
last
week,
this
court
summarily
affirmed
in
gable
versus
jenkins
number
1049
on
the
docket
of
the
court,
a
case
involving
action
under
a
distinguishable
statute
in
the
same
jurisdiction
as
stanley.
distinguishable
from
the
statute
in
the
stanley
case
but
a
statute
very
much
like
that
upheld
in
the
roth
case
and
very
much
like
the
statute
under
consideration
in
the
case
at
bar.
the
statute
upheld
in
roth
prohibited
commercial
distribution
of
pornography.
the
massachusetts
statute,
chapter
272,
section
28(a)
is
of
like
tenet.
it
strikes
at
public
dissemination.
this,
we
submit,
does
not
affect
a
fact
situation
like
that
present
in
stanley
versus
georgia.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
it
was
a
summary
affirmance,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
gable
versus
jenkins,
number
1049.
as
i
recall,
i
think
there
were
two
justices
either
abstaining
or
dissenting,
your
honor.
for
all
of
the
foregoing
reasons
that
i
have
brought
forth
--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
1049
your
honor.
i'm
aware
that
the
solicitor
general
is
going
to
take
some
time
of
the
honorable
court
and
will
dwell
exclusively
on
the
issue
of
obscenity
and
the
relationship
between
the
roth
decision
and
those
following
it
and
stanley
versus
georgia.
so
i
will
conclude,
submitting
that
for
all
of
the
foregoing
and
for
the
reasons
brought
forth
in
our
brief,
we
submit
that
the
court
below
abused
its
discretion
in
granting
relief
and
should
be
reversed
on
that
instance.
we
also
submit
that
the
right
to
prohibit
obscenity,
that
right
annunciated
in
roth
and
the
right
to
possess
obscene
matter
in
the
privacy
of
one's
home
that
right
protected
in
stanley
are
compatible
as
this
court
has
held.
and
that
therefore,
the
massachusetts
statute
is
constitutional.
we
asked
this
honorable
court
so
to
hold
and
add
again
if
i
may
be
able
to
do
so
a
special
plea
on
behalf
of
the
judicial
systems
of
the
several
states,
the
enforcement
officials
and
the
legislatures
of
those
several
states
that
this
honorable
court
make
that
latter
point
clear.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
think
that
this
court
here
could
consider
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
submit
that
we
do
have
here
a
commercial
aspect.
this
is
the
appellees
here
in
question
where
the
owners
and
the
manager
and
the
corporate
owner
of
a
movie
house
so
that
there
is
sufficient
here
for
the
court
with
other
cases
presently
under
consideration
there
is
sufficient
here
for
the
court
to
elaborate
on
what
we
find
in
stanley
versus
georgia.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
respectfully
submit
your
honor
that
this
is
basic
to
the
question
of
obscenity
no
matter
where
the
issue
is
applied.
i'm
well
aware
of
the
position
of
your
honor
regarding
obscenity
but
there
is
another
opinion
and
there
is
an
opinion
supported
by
actions
of
the
legislatures
of
the
several
states
as
well
as
the
united
sates
congress
which
has
proscribed
obscenity
and
there
is
support
in
legal
opinion
that
suggests
that
obscenity
in
its
reference
may
properly
continue
to
be
difficult
a
specific
definition
and
specific
application
as
has
been
stated
by
one
justice
i
know
it
when
i
see
it.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
do
so
your
honor
and
this
is
another
reason
why
further
clarification
of
the
distinctions
made
by
this
court
would
be
helpful
to
all
of
us
who
are
in
society
and
in
law
enforcement.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
respectfully.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
must
answer
in
the
affirmative
to
all
of
these
disjunctives,
your
honor.
there
is
an
evidentiary
problem
in
determining
obscenity
or
not.
this
is
the
case
that
was
tried
in
this
particular
matter
in
the
state
court.
there
is
also
of
course
the
overview
of
this
honorable
court
as
far
as
the
extent
to
which
the
factual
problem
of
obscenity
goes
and
constantly,
we
have
seen
cases
brought
before
here
arguing
the
issue
of
obscenity
on
a
given
set
of
facts.
fortunately,
that
is
not
the
case
here.
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that's
one
of
the
tests,
yes
your
honor.
how
this
is
established
is
extremely
difficult
i'm
sure
for
the
court
as
well
as
for
individual
late
people,
citizens
of
unite
states
of
america.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
well
stated,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
in
massachusetts,
we
always
thought
that
20
miles
an
hour
was
a
reasonable
speed
practically
anyway,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
all
agree
that
we
have
difficulty
with
the
definition
of
obscenity.
i
must
confess
now.
i
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
with
the
definition
of
the
word
“threat”.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
threat,
your
honor.
after
five-and-a-half
months
of
showing
of
the
film
by
the
appellees
here,
“i
am
curious
(yellow),”
after
a
trial
in
the
merits
in
superior
court
lasting
days
not
suddenly
in
a
colloquy
in
the
federal
court,
the
district
attorney
declines
to
renew
a
stipulation
which
he
made
previously
that
he
would
not
seek
further
prosecution
or
seek
to
enjoin
the
showing
of
this
film
until
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
in
the
merits.
this
--
this
is
all
called
threats.
this
is
all
called
job
owning.
this
is
all
called
multiple
prosecutions.
this
is
called
dombrowski
a
fortiori.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
pardon
my
latin,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
this
is
called
dombrowski
a
fortiori,
i
submit,
it
is
neither
a
fortiori
although
weaker.
it
is
completely
not
the
case.
the
record
shows
no
evidence
of
threats
whatsoever
but
simply
a
declination
to
renew
a
stipulation
by
the
district
attorney.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
submit
that
however
we
interpret
or
define
threat
that
cannot
be
held
to
be
a
threat
legally
in
the
english
language
or
even
in
the
swedish
language.
further,
we
must
accept
the
fact
that
my
brother
has
conceded
that
there
has
never
been
an
effort
made
in
the
state
courts
of
massachusetts
to
continue
the
showing
of
this
film.
i
submit
in
conclusion
that
the
appellees
here
are
not
grove
press,
inc.
the
appellees
here
are
film
distributors.
the
action
on
the
part
of
the
appellants
has
never
under
any
color
or
interpretation
of
that
action
been
able
to
be
defined
as
threats
or
anywhere
near
the
fact
of
situation
existing
in
dombrowski
versus
pfister.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
and
the
bill
of
exceptions
was
entered
yesterday
in
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
which
leads
us
to
the
safe
assumption
that
this
court,
this
case
will
be
argued
on
the
merits
in
massachusetts
in
the
october
sitting.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
our
massachusetts
supreme
court
has
a
tradition
of
never
having
to
let
the
year
pass
without
deciding
all
of
the
cases
that
were
argued
before
and
i
think
it's
safe
to
assume
that
within
a
month
or
two
after
the
oral
argument
that
there'd
be
a
decision
on
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
here
on
appeal
from
an
interlocutory
order
of
the
united
states
district
court,
for
the
district
of
massachusetts,
under
the
provisions
of
28
united
states
code
1253.
that
provides
for
direct
appeal
from
an
order
or
judgment
of
a
three-judge
court
granting
temporary
injunctive
relief
against
enforcement
of
a
state
statute.
in
our
view,
this
appeal
presents
two
equally
important
issues,
which
ought
to
be
finally
resolved
by
this
court.
the
first
is
whether
the
court
below
abused
its
discretion
in
enjoining
the
district
attorney
from
prosecuting
in
the
future
on
account
of
the
showing
of
the
film,
“i
am
curious
yellow,”
which
the
court
below
assumed
to
be
obscene.
the
second
is
whether
under
this
court’s
holding
in
stanley
versus
georgia,
any
state
can
constitutionally
prohibit
public,
commercialized
dissemination
of
pornographic
matter,
absent
distribution
to
minors,
non-consenting
adults,
or
by
pandering.
the
facts
maybe
stated
briefly
as
follows:
on
june
30,
1969,
after
preliminary
proceedings
not
relevant
here,
the
appellees
filed
an
amended
complaint
in
the
court
below,
alleging
reason
to
believe
that
indictments
would
be
sought
against
them,
by
appellant
byrnes
office,
under
massachusetts
general
laws,
chapter
272,
section
28
(a).
shortly
thereafter,
the
indictments
were
in
fact
sought
and
returned.
appellees
saw
the
declaration
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
that
injunction
against
prosecution
there
under.
they
alleged
the
statute
was
overbroad,
because
among
other
things,
adequately
controlled
commercial
distribution
of
obscene
material
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
the
court
declined
to
grant
injunctive
or
other
relief,
but
requested
briefs
on
the
questions
regarding
the
scope
of
this
court’s
holding,
in
stanley
versus
georgia.
and
the
effect
of
that
opinion
on
the
massachusetts
statute,
prosecution
continued
in
the
state
court,
in
a
jury
waived
session
and
the
appellees
were
convicted.
following
their
conviction,
the
appellees
renewed
their
request
for
injunctive
relief.
after
further
argument,
a
majority
of
the
court
below
held
that
stanley
versus
georgia
went
so
far
as
to
prohibit
state
prosecutions,
with
respect
to
adequately
controlled
public
distribution
of
obscene
material.
and
the
court
decided
that
the
massachusetts
statute
was
probably
unconstitutional
as
being
overbroad
on
its
face.
based
on
this
opinion,
a
majority
of
the
court
below
enjoined
the
appellants
from
further
prosecution
with
respect
to
showing
of
the
film,
i’m
curious
yellow.”
this
matter
was
argued
before
this
honorable
court
on
april
38th
and
subsequently
ordered
for
re-argument.
in
the
meantime,
the
appellees’
appeal
was
entered
in
the
state
court.
oral
argument
in
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
has
been
delayed,
pending
a
motion
for
postponement
filed
by
the
appellees
here.
i
address
myself
first
to
the
question,
whether
the
court
below
abused
its
discretion
in
granting
injunctive
relief.
comity
and
federalism
prompt
a
federal
judge
to
be
extremely
reluctant
to
enjoin
good
faith
enforcement
of
a
state’s
criminal
laws
by
that
state's
law
enforcement
officials.
what
have
we
here
to
contravene
that
fundamental
principle?
no
monetary
loss.
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
of
any
financial
loss
on
the
part
of
appellees
here.
they
had
no
proprietary
interest
in
the
subject
matter.
they’re
not
the
owners
of
a
film.
rather
they
own
a
movie
house.
there's
no
chilling
effect
either
on
the
appelles
or
their
patrons.
these
are
not
politically
hand
bills,
but
commercial
pornography.
assumptively
in
the
court
below
and
after
a
finding
in
a
trial,
a
subject
matter
assumed
to
be
obscene,
we
submit.
all
the
more
so
is
subject
matter
found
in
a
trial
below
to
be
obscene,
cannot
be
said
to
have
any
value
within
itself.
this
film
further
showed
for
five-and-a-half
months,
pending
the
argument
on
the
merits
and
the
decision
of
obscenity
on
the
facts,
in
a
trial,
in
the
suffolk
superior
court
in
massachusetts.
we’ve
been
only
able
to
find
one
instance,
where
this
court
approved
relief
granted
against
a
state
law
enforcement
official.
that
is
of
course,
the
decision
in
dombrowski
versus
pfister
in
380
united
states
479.
the
dombrowski
case
was
a
matter
of
civil
rights
advocacy.
it's
record
is
replete
with
incidence
of
bad
faith,
for
example
night
raids,
made
by
law
enforcement
officials
on
the
offices
and
the
homes
of
individuals
involved.
we
have
none
of
that
here.
here
we
have
first
of
all,
activity
whose
dominant
theme
is
offensive
to
community
standards
of
morality,
whose
appeal
is
to
a
prurient
interest
in
sex,
whose
content
is
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value.
here
we
have
no
bad
faith,
either
on
the
record,
or
argued
below
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution
or
law
enforcement
officials.
this
has
been
a
single
case,
pursued
by
the
district
attorney
in
suffolk
county,
in
the
course
of
his
work
as
the
elected
district
attorney
of
the
people,
pursued
while
the
film
showing
by
the
appellees
in
their
theater
continued
for
five-and-a-half
months.
here,
we
submit
is
a
classic
example
for
the
application
of
the
principle
of
abstention.
if
the
statute,
chapter
272,
section
28
(a)
of
the
massachusetts
general
laws,
should
be
overbroad,
and
we
do
not
concede
this,
that’s
fault
here
can
be
overcome
by
leaving
the
case
to
be
resolved
in
the
state
court.
and
by
giving
the
state
court
the
opportunity
to
narrowly
construe
the
law
and
thus,
avoid
any
constitutional
defect.
this
can
be--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
the
proceedings
below
have
been
staid,
your
honor,
pending
or
are
subsequent
to
a
motion
by
the
appellees
that
the
oral
argument
on
this
case
be
postponed
until
the
decision
in
this
court
was
made
on
the
issue
of
obscenity,
generally.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
there
was
a
conviction
in
suffolk
county
superior
court.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
appeal
was
prosecuted
to
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court,
that
argument,
i
believe
would
have
been
made
orally
before
the
court
in
the
first
week
of
october,
but
sometime
in
september,
i
think
september
16th,
the
motion
was
filed
by
the
appellees
here
for
postponement.
postponement
on
the
issue
of
whether
obscenity
can
be
proscribed
any
longer
by
any
state
court,
a
decision
by
this
court
and--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
postponement
of
the
oral
argument,
as
far
as
that
is
concerned
and
we
assent
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that’s
what
the
honorable
court
decided
that
if
there
was
going
to
be
any
postponement
at
all,
it
would
be
a
postponement
of
the
complete
oral
argument.
they
would
not
separate
the
issues
involved
in
one
case.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
believe
it
has
been
by
formal
order,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
yes
sir,
on
the
motion
of
the
appellees
here.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
we
did
not,
we
assented
to
the
motion
provided
that
the
issues
not
be
divided,
but
the
case
be
taken
as
a
whole.
we
had
no
objection
either
to
arguing
the
total
case
as
a
whole
in
october
or
to
postponing
the
oral
argument
on
the
total
case,
until
some
decision
should
be
made
by
this
honorable
court.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
none
whatsoever
your
honor.
only
the
motion
affirming
the
action
taken.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that’s
correct.
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
on
notice
by
both
parties,
i
think
that
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
would
schedule
a
case
for
oral
argument
at
the
earliest
convenient
date.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
think
that
if
pending
a
visit
by
the
appelles
and
the
appellants
here,
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts,
the
court
would
immediately
schedule
that
case
for
oral
argument
there.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
it
does
not
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
it
does
not
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that
is
correct
your
honor,
on
whether
as
i've
said
in
the
second
issue,
to
be
considered
by
the
court,
whether
under
the
court’s
holding
in
stanley
versus
georgia,
any
state
can
constitutionally
prohibit
the
public
commercialized
dissemination
of
pornographic
matter,
without
any
consideration
to
this
distribution
being
to
minors,
or
non-consenting
adults
or
by
pandering.
and
i
have
addressed
myself
to
the
first
argument,
which
i
believe
is
basic
to
my
appearance
before
this
honorable
court,
that
of
whether
the
court
below
abused
its
discretion
in
enjoining
the
district
attorney
from
prosecuting
in
the
future
on
account
of
showing
of
a
film,
which
has
been
adjudged
by
a
competent
court
as
obscene.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that
is
true
your
honor,
unless
the
court
in
its--
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
i
think
last
week,
this
honorable
court
heard
a
lot
of
arguments
on
the
merits
of
that
film
and
on
the
issue
of
proscribing
obscenity,
that’s
correct,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
have
suggested
that
in
this
case
pending,
we
have
the
classic
example
for
the
application
of
the
principle
of
abstention,
by
this
court.
we
further
submit
that
if
chapter
272,
section
28
(a),
should
be
read
to
be
overbroad
in
the
light
of
the
most
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
in
stanley
versus
georgia,
that
that
fault
could
be
overcome
by
a
decision
and
by
a
narrow
construction
made
in
that
decision,
by
our
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
in
the
single
case,
now
pending
before
the
court.
this
would
avoid
the
constitutional
defect.
and
it
would
further
avoid
any
possible
irritant
to
the
federal
state
relationship,
which
is
a
matter
of
grave
concern
to
this
court,
and
a
matter
of
grave
concern
to
all
of
us
in
the
field
of
criminal
justice
administration
in
the
united
states
of
america.
were
we
to
assume
that
the
statutory
validity
of
the
massachusetts
law
is
affected
by
stanley
versus
georgia?
we
think
this
court
ought
to
leave
for
the
state
and
its
court
to
interpret
and
to
limit
the
application
of
the
state
statute,
within
that
holding
of
stanley
versus
georgia.
similarly,
as
this
honorable
court
itself
has
subsequently
limited
the
application
of
stanley
versus
georgia.
my
brother,
the
solicitor
general
will
discuss
the
substance
of
the
second
issue,
which
we
have
touched
upon
in
the
questions
put
before
me,
that
relating
to
the
constitutional
right
of
any
state
or
any
government
to
proscribe
obscenity
within
the
framework
of
the
first
amendment
to
our
united
states
constitution.
i
respectfully
submit
again
that
this
court
has
heard
many
arguments
on
this
issue
that
during
this
term,
as
well
as
the
term
before.
and
i
will
leave
the
burden
of
that
argument
to
my
brother,
the
solicitor
general.
for
these
reasons,
it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
very
briefly,
i
choose
to
touch
upon
three
items
which
i
think
have
been
a
part
of
the
appellees
argument.
the
first
relates
to
what
i
think
has
been
referred
to
as
a
novel
approach
for
law
enforcement
in
the
field
of
obscenity.
the
suggestion
is
of
course.
that
a
customs
case
in
the
second
circuit
is
one
that
ought
to
invite
the
interest
of
every
state
law
enforcement
official.
this,
i
respectfully
submit
is
one
aspect
or
one
approach
to
law
enforcement
of
which
i
want
no
part
whatsoever.
for
the
first
reason,
i
don’t
know
how
a
state
could
intervene
into
a
federal
customs
case.
i
know
of
no
provision
that
would
entitle
any
of
us
who
might
be
states
attorney’s
general
or
district
attorney’s
to
step
into
this
court
to
be
ultimately
bound.
for
another
reason,
i
am
not
prepared
anymore
than
any
other
individual
in
this
courtroom
to
make
the
assumption
that
some
imported
film
or
other
item
is
obscene
or
ought
to
have
my
supervision
immediately
on
its
importation
to
be
obscene.
i
think
first
any
one
of
us
in
law
enforcement
would
have
to
have
an
opportunity
to
make
a
judgment
on
the
facts
would
have
to
see
the
film
as
in
this
case
in
our
jurisdiction.
it
should
not
be
asked
either
to
come
in
out
of
curiosity
to
another
jurisdiction
or
another
court
or
to
come
in
on
notice
or
in
any
binding
effect
of
that
particular
decision.
on
the
contrary,
in
this
particular
case,
there
must
have
been
some
assumption
to
the
validity
of
the
particular
act
which
is
the
showing
of
the
film
until
there
was
a
contrary
decision
made
and
this
is
exactly
what
occurred
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts.
there
was
an
allegation
or
complaint
and
indictment,
one
single
action
taken
by
a
qualified
law
enforcement
official
of
suffolk
county.
there
were
many
arguments
and
there
was
a
hearing.
there
was
a
trial
conducted.
and
this
covered
a
period
of
five-and-a-half
months
when
the
particular
film
in
question
showed,
when
there
was
no
chill
whatsoever
on
any
citizen’s
rights.
whether
the
appellees
here
or
any
viewers
as
far
as
their
opportunity
to
observe
the
film
“i
am
curious
yellow”
which
two
judges
out
of
three
and
the
second
circuit
court
determined
was
not
obscene.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
from
the
beginning
of
the
--
from
the
spring
of
1969
mr.
justice
stewart,
which
i
think
was
probably
in
may
and
then
an
indictment
was
sought
some
time
around
the
last
week
of
june
by
the
district
attorney
of
suffolk
county
and
there
was
no
--
there
was
action
then
taken
by
the
appellees
in
the
federal
court
but
there
was
no
controlling
action
taken
by
the
federal
court
nor
was
there
any
other
action
taken
by
the
district
attorney
of
suffolk
county.
just
one
single
indictment
and
during
the
time
when
these
arguments
ensued
and
when
the
trial
on
the
issue
was
held
in
a
jury
waived
session
in
suffolk
superior
court,
that
covered
a
period
of
five-and-a-half
months.
mr.
robert
h.
quinn
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
there
is
not
that
remedy
available
to
the
prosecutor
but
there
is
the
remedy
of
declaratory
judgment
which
was
an
approach
endorsed
by
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
in
its
decision
of
commonwealth
versus
baird
where
these
first
amendment
issues
are
brought
into
focus.
and
there
has
been
other
precedent
in
the
massachusetts
court
system
for
act
of
approach
taken
by
anyone
asserting
his
individual
rights.
so
this
film
showed
for
five-and-a-half
months
in
the
massachusetts
jurisdiction
not
withstanding
the
district
attorney
of
suffolk
county
had
no
opportunity
to
appear
in
the
second
circuit.
of
course,
implicit
in
this
is
the
fact
that
we
cannot
assume
that
there
were
any
threats
on
the
part
of
the
district
attorney
of
suffolk
county
or
the
attorney
general
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
during
this
five-and-a-half
month
period.
there
were
no
threats
and
i
further
suggest
that
a
threat
connotes
illegal
action
on
the
part
of
a
state
law
enforcement
official.
well,
there
was
only
one
single
action
taken
during
this
five-and-a-half
month
period.
there
has
been
no
action
taken
by
the
district
attorney
since
that
period,
only
the
fact
that
he
will
not
pledge
to
undergo
no
further
prosecutions,
should
this
film
be
shown.
though
there
was
the
forbearance
on
the
part
of
the
appellees
here,
after
the
finding
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
after
a
finding
by
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
in
suffolk
county
that
there
is
obscenity.
that
any
prosecuting
official,
any
law
enforcement
official
who
should
take
a
pledge
that
he
would
not
move
against
the
film
found
in
fact
to
be
obscene
in
his
jurisdiction
would
not
be
upholding
his
sworn
duty
to
administer
the
law
and
to
prosecute
crime
but
there
was
no
such
statement
made
only
that
a
change
had
occurred.
this
was
after
the
five-and-a-half
month
showing.
this
was
after
a
finding
of
obscenity.
this
was
after
i
respectfully
submit,
a
removal
of
that
presumption
which
must
have
existed
on
the
part
of
individuals.
on
the
basis
of
the
decision,
the
2:1
decision
in
the
second
circuit.
i
further
suggest
to
this
honorable
court
what
else
is
a
law
enforcement
official
to
do
as
far
as
these
cases
are
concerned,
if
over
his
shoulder
constantly
is
--
i
would
not
use
the
threat
but
is
the
possibility
of
federal
court
intervention
in
every
action
that
might
be
under
taken
by
that
state
law
enforcement
official
in
good
faith,
in
the
pursuance
of
his
duty?
what
else
is
he
to
do
but
stand
still
and
i
submit,
let
something
now
presumptively
a
crime
continued
to
be
perpetuated
within
his
jurisdiction.
i
would
further
suggest
that
if
we
are
to
remove
the
very
pressing
issue
of
obscenity
from
determinations
by
this
court
or
by
any
individual
citizen,
nobody
has
seriously
suggested
that
i
have
heard
that
we
not
continue
to
apply
the
limitations
which
were
mentioned
in
the
provisos
in
the
injunction
by
the
court
below.
those
limitations
that
provided
this
injunction
shall
not
apply
if
the
picture
is
advertised
in
a
manner
pandering
to
prurient
interest
in
sex
or
is
shown
to
an
audience
not
warned
of
its
possibly
offensive
character,
or
is
shown
to
children
under
the
age
of
18
years,
i
respectfully
submit
that
more
constitutional
issues
could
be
raised
in
any
one
of
these
three
classifications
than
i
raise
in
the
whole
issue
of
what
is
obscene
and
not
obscene
under
the
context
of
definitions
of
obscenity
as
outlined
by
this
court
in
roth
versus
the
united
states.
we
would
have
to
wonder
what
size
ad
newspaper
add
was
advertising
in
a
manner
pandering
to
prurient
interest.
we’d
have
to
wonder,
if
showing
the
film
in
disney
land
with
all
the
cautions
in
the
world
was
nevertheless
a
failure
to
warn
a
possible
offensive
character.
we
would
have
to
wonder
if
some
young
people
in
these
united
states
who
come
from,
for
example,
the
mediterranean
countries
in
the
heritage
as
my
own
wife
does,
should
not
be
allowed
a
greater
degree
of
maturity
than
age
18
or
than
those
individuals
of
my
own
heritage
who
might
have
come
from
northern
european
countries.
no,
i
hardly
think
that
removing
obscenity
as
proscribed
conduct
could
remove
the
problems
that
beset
law
enforcement
officials
and
this
honorable
court
alike
in
the
area
of
obscenity.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
