justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
there
in
stanley
that
protects
commercial
distribution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
we
take
judicial
notice
that
“i
am
curious,
yellow”
gets
a
heavier
box
office
price
than
the
others?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
look
in
the
newspaper.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
far
as
the
record
of
stanley,
it
shows
that
somebody
might
have
given
it
to
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
lewin,
there's
not
a
lot
of
difference.
in
the
dombrowski
case
as
i
read
it,
they
were
putting
that
man
out
of
business
in
this
whole
organization.
and
if
i
understand
general
quinn,
your
client
is
still
in
business
running
with
a
packed
audience.
justice
thurgood
marshall
were
you
having
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
any
of
those
allegations
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
he's
--
well,
it
is
--
well,
let's
face
facts.
is
that
except
if
they
want
to
speak
or
make
a
book?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
granted
but
i
--
i'd
be
no
--
you
say
he's
been
denied
his
speech
all
the
time
this
has
been
pending.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
you'll
admit
that
his
theater
hadn't
been
closed
yet.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
i
assume
you'd
say
that
if
the
prosecutor
said
you
shall
not
say,
“thy
kingdom
come”
on
the
corner
that
he'd
been
denied
his
right
to
speech?
justice
thurgood
marshall
unless
there's
anything
else
he
wants
to.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
dombrowksi.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
there
--
is
there
anything
in
this
case
that
says
that
the
prosecution
or
anybody
is
out
to
stop
this
man's
speech?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
can
construe
that
in
saying
we
don't
want
you
to
show
this
one
picture.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
harris'
pamphlet.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
not
this
man's
film.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
his
on
--
it's
his
by
being
loaned
to
and
to
be
--
for
a
price.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
a
lot
different
from
a
man
that
prints
his
own
pamphlet
and
has
a
right
to
distribute
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
problem
is
that
the
man
that's
in
business
to
run
--
he
hopes
to
run
a
packed
house
everyday
and
here's
a
one
film
you
can't
show
and
he
runs
a
packed
house
everyday
and
despite
your
claim
that
he
is
interested
in
speech,
how
is
he
damaged?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
admit
he
is
not
damaged
financially.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
depends
on
the
professor's
argument
of
whether
he
does
have
a
constitutional
right
showed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
bonnie
and
clyde?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
offensive
to
some
people?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn’t
that
offensive
to
most
people?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
a
state
could
ban
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
see
any
problem
with
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
i
understand
you're
at
the
point
of
saying
that
obscenity
is
against
the
people
in
the
communities,
morals,
customs,
and
beliefs.
and
i'm
really
asking
you,
is
bonnie
and
clyde
also
in
that
category?
that’s
only
the
point
i’m
making,
trying
to
make.
justice
thurgood
marshall
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
would
you
know
that
this
is
the
same
picture?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
worries
me
about
the
children
in
fact,
it’s
been
shown
before
5
million
people.
it
was
a
little
warm
rather
than
chilling.
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
i
said
last
week
it’s
not
totally
cold
in
maryland
to
the
people
who
can’t
drive
to
the
district.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
don’t
understand
your
answer
to
my
brother
stewart
here
that
you
don’t
have
some
obligation
to
litigate
this.
you
just
want
--
now
you
don’t
even
want
to
litigate
it,
except
in
one
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn’t
that
what
you’re
saying?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
mean
the
state
of
hawaii
could
come
in
to
new
york
and
defend
its
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
wouldn’t
consider
that
a
burden
on
hawaii?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
you
would
consider
the
burden
on
you
if
it
didn’t
have.
i’m
just
worrying
about
this
shift
in
the
burden.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
what
do
you
see
in
dombrowski
that
says
that
that
applies
to
other
peoples
other
than
dombrowski?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
find
in
dombrowski
that
says
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
saying
that
the
dombrowski
opinion
is
enough
so
that
somebody
tried
to
search
somebody
in
new
york,
they
can’t
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
we
said
in
that
that
was
all
right
involving
children?
that
you
could
prohibit
children
from
seeing
the
picture,
i
thought
that’s
what
we
said
in
that
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
any
figure
to
show
that
these
motion
pictures
are
dropping
off
in
numbers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
i
gather
some
would
say
the
opposite.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
hope
you’re
not
saying
that
it’s
been
chilled.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
means
it
if
one
distribute
their
obscene
pictures
is
bankrupt?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
assume
that
the
profit
--
if
there
are
four
million
that
have
seen
it
$5.00
a
head,
my
arithmetic
could
get
in
trouble.
i
wouldn’t
get
--
what
i’m
trying
to
say
is
i
wouldn’t
get
in
to
the
point
about
trying
to
get
this
license.
you
don’t
need
that
for
your
case,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
there
in
stanley
that
protects
commercial
distribution?
justice
thurgood

could
we
take
