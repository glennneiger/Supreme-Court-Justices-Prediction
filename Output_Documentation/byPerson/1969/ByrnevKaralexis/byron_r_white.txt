justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
name
of
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
it
not
being
shown?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
why
didn't
you
show
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
substance
of
your
position
then
is
that
federal
intervention
is
justified
by
a
desire
to
avoid
a
state
criminal
prosecution?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
effective
--
when
the
threat
of
criminal
prosecution
is
effective
enough
to
deter
someone
from
exercising
what
he
claims
or
his
right
of
free
speech,
and
which
he
would
otherwise
exercise.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
there's
some
risk
that
you
have
to
take.
you
could
go
ahead
and
show
your
film.
you
just
don't
want
to
take
the
risk.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
showing
the
film
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
aren't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
your
decision
to
that
respect?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
i
suppose
they
would
be
in
the
same
position
as
the
prosecutor
never
said
a
word.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
never
know
what
the
prosecutor
is
going
to
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
he
supposed
to
do?
what
is
the
prosecutor
supposed
to
do?
say,
“i
think
you're
breaking
the
law
but
you
can
--
you
think
you're
not
but
you
can
go
and
--
but
i
am
constitutionally
obligated
to
let
you
go
on
breaking
the
law
until
we
get
a
decision,”
is
that
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the
state
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
did
the
state
court
refused
to
issue
the
temporary
relief?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
couldn't
the
state
enjoin
the
prosecutor
for
many
further
prosecutions
pending
decision
of
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
try
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
pending
a
state
criminal
prosecution,
pending
the
outcome
of
the
state
criminal
prosecution
that
federal
court
is
authorized
to
require
that
the
conduct
that's
challenged
by
the
state
be
permitted
to
continue.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
where
there
is
a
film
involved.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
--
i
suppose
then
freedman
against
maryland
really
ought
to
be
amended
in
your
position
to
say
that
no
state
board
of
censors
can
stop
a
film
pending
appeal
of
the
censorship
decisions.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
on
appeal,
it
doesn't.
it
doesn't
regulate
the
length
of
time
that
it's
on
appeal
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
especially
to
this
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
nevertheless,
in
the
freedman
case,
the
state
of
maryland
would
be
saying
you
can't
show
the
film
and
you're
not
going
to
show
it
until
--
unless
you
can
get
this
order
up
set
on
appeal
and
it
may
take
a
long
time,
and
freedman
doesn't
even
limit
the
time
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
maryland.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
haven't
given
them
the
chance
to
focus
on
it.
you
haven't
even
asked
them
about
the
interim
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
haven't
even
asked
the
state
court
or
anybody
else
in
the
state
about
an
interim
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
if
it
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
issue
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
one
of
the
issues
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
sounds
like
my
brother
marshall.
justice
byron
r.
white
nothing.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
by
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
going
to
say
that
you
can
have
a
decision
on
that
in
the
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why?
in
your
argument,
you
cannot
force
a
man
to
make
his
federal
constitutional
claim
to
the
state
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
said
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
wasn't
even
talking
about
abstention.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
name
of
the
