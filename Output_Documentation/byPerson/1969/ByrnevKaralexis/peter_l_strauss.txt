mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
court
knows,
the
government
appears
here
today
only
with
respect
to
the
issues
in
this
case,
involving
the
meaning
of
its
decision
two
terms
ago
in
stanley
versus
georgia
and
as
the
court
knows
that
decision
has
led
to
a
good
deal
of
ferment
in
this
general
area,
including
the
invalidation
of
two
central
federal
statutes,
which
we
shall
be
appearing
here
later
in
the
term
to
defend.
the
facts
of
stanley
and
we
think
are
significant.
the
police
almost
by
accident
searching
through
an
individual’s
home
for
other
purposes
came
upon
three
reels
of
motion
pictures
and
some
other
items,
which
no
one
knew
were
there,
looked
through
those
films
and
concluded
that
they
were
obscene,
arrested
mr.
stanley
for
possession
of
obscene
matter,
under
georgia’s
statute,
which
permitted
punishment
for
that
purpose.
the
case
came
here
and
the
court
held
and
what
i
think
was
carefully
limited
language
that
the
mere
possession
of
obscene
matter
cannot
constitutionally
be
made
a
crime.
that
formula
--
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
none
whatsoever,
to
us
the
central
fact
and
stanley
really
was
the
very
accidental
nature.
no
one
knew
that
mr.
stanley
had
that
material
or
certainly
no
one
in
the
general
public
knew
that
before
it
was
discovered
by
happenstance
in
his
desk.
well,
it's
not
quite
happenstance,
the
officers
were
there
searching
for
other
materials.
they
certainly
didn’t
expect
to
find
that.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
don’t
think
it's
necessary,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
go
so
far
to
be
as
gentle
with
stanley
as
to
say
that
the
issue
of
pandering
wasn’t
in
that
case.
i
would
put
it
the
issue
of
public
knowledge
was
not
in
that
case.
and
this
court,
i
think
was
quite
careful
in
its
statement,
regarding
that
case,
to
indicate
that
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
private
possession
that
was
before
and
that
that
was
all
that
the
holding
meant.
lower
courts
however,
have
not
been
so
minded
about
the
opinion.
there
is
as
the
court
knows
and
i'm
sure
this
court
feels
that
a
good
deal
of
impatience
about
this
very
troublesome
issue
of
obscenity.
and
there
are
in
the
opinion
here
and
there
remarks
which
could
be
take
in
the
way
that
court
below
here
has
taken
them.
that
if
one
is
careful,
if
one
restricts
access
to
the
movie
to
those
who
want
to
see
it.
and
to
those
who
are
adult
enough,
so
that
ordinary
parens
patriae,
considerations
do
not
come
into
effect.
and
if
one
doesn’t
offend
sensibilities
by
advertising,
well,
then
one
has
a
constitutional
right
to
show
the
movie,
to
commercially
exploit
it.
and
again,
since
the
chief
justice
has
brought
it
up,
i
want
to
stress
that
we
aren’t
talking
here
about
commercial
exploitation,
in
the
sense
of
the
ginsburg
case
in
a
pandering
sense,
simply
public
sale,
unadorned
by
any
kind
of
special
attention
on
the
hypothesis
of
this
case
to
the
sexual
aspects
or
the
sexually
provocative
aspects
of
the
film.
i
should
like
to
start
my
discussion
a
little
way
off
in
the
obscenity
question,
but
in
a
way
that
i
think
again,
calls
attention
to
this
central
character
of
public
knowledge
of
what's
going
on.
let
us
suppose
that
a
traveling
carnival
should
come
to
washington.
setup
tents,
which
are
perfectly
well
enclosed
and
screened
from
public
view
and
announce
that
in
those
tents,
for
those
who
wish
to
pay
and
come
and
see
it,
there
will
be
a
bearbaiting
contest
in
which
five
dogs
and
a
chained
bear
will
be
set
against
each
other,
until
some
or
all
of
the
participants
are
dead.
let's
suppose
that
that
could
be
done
in
perfect
safety
for
all
of
the
viewers.
i
think
that
it
maybe
perfectly
clear
that
no
one
would
leave
that
tent
to
commit
an
act
of
violence.
and
i
think
it
may
also
be
clear
that
no
one
who
would
wish
not
to
see
the
scene
in
the
tent
would
be
forced
to
do
so.
but
i
submit
it's
also
clear
that
the
community
to
which
that
carnival
came
could
prohibit
it,
if
it
were
so
minded,
and
that’s
a
public
policy
question
on
which
all
might
not
agree.
but,
i
think
if
the
community
decided
to
prohibit
that
show,
it
could
do
so.
the
distress
which
is
caused
to
those
who
don’t
come,
but
who
know
what's
going
to
go
on
in
the
tent,
who
know
for
a
certainty
what
will
appear
and
that
is
a
very
real
distress.
the
long
term
brutalization
of
society,
which
the
society
may
fear
will
result.
the
strain
on
social
fabric
through
public
tolerance
of
what
is
to
many
members
of
that
society
utterly
repellent.
all
of
these
factors
would
seem
to
me
to
justify
such
regulation.
it
has
never
been
held
that
society
lacks
power
to
protect
the
sensibilities
or
to
deal
with
these
occurrences,
that
it
must
not
only
tolerate,
but
in
a
meaningful
sense
legitimize
these
activities.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
i
think
it
would
be
as
clear.
it's
inconceivable
to
me
that
the
court
would
extend
less
protection
to
a
theatrical
performance
than
it
does
to
film,
just
because
the
performance
happened
to
be
live,
rather
than
preserved
on
acetate.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
but
neither
would
a
stage
production.
in
a
bank
robbery,
i
think
and
i
tried
to
select
the
hypothetical
carefully.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right,
well
that
no
offense
against
the
law.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
for
the
bears
and
the
dogs.
excuse
me,
for
the
bears
and
the
dogs,
they
commit
no
crime.
there
is
this
offense
of
cruelty
to
animals,
which
i
think
is
what
you're
referring
to.
but
i
think
that
is
an
entirely
analogous
offense
to
the
obscenity
offense.
it
is
an
offense
designed
to
protect
human
sensibilities.
the
dogs
and
the
bears
that
may
survive
the
fighting
aren’t
in
any
sense
punished.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
my
answer
is--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
wouldn’t
say
justice
marshall,
and
i
suppose
it's
not
really
important
to
do
so,
as
i
just
stated,
i
don’t
think
it
would
make
any
difference,
whatsoever,
if
bonnie
and
clyde
were
presented
on
the
stage,
rather
than
in
the
form
of
a
movie
picture,
that’s
part
of
my
point.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
don’t
think
it's
necessary
for
me
to
say
so.
i
personally
wouldn’t
think
so,
but
i
don’t
think
that’s
important
here.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i'm
afraid
i
don’t
see
the
direction--i
don’t
see
what
you're
getting
at--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
suppose
such
statutes
have
been
generally
thought
to
be
more
difficult
to
administer,
without
saying
whether
it
was
bonnie
and
clyde,
in
particular,
i
suppose
if
there
were
a
statute,
which
could
be
sufficiently,
carefully
drawn
as
to
which
one
could
make
the
conclusion
that
was
made
in
roth,
regarding
obscenity
legislation
that
it
is
not
vague
that
a
state
could
indeed
prohibit
the
screen
depiction
of
certain
forms
of
carnage,
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
that’s
the
matter
of
the
court,
at
least
the
forms
of
conduct
that
are
coming
to
mind
maybe
a
matter
that
the
court
hasn’t
yet
decided.
i
may
say,
it
maybe
my
fault,
i
have
the
feeling
of
having
gotten
into
somewhat
of
an
alley.
i
am
not
trying
to
draw
any
distinction
here
between
conduct
on
the
one
hand
and
representations
of
conduct
on
the
other
hand.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
certainly
true,
but
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
in
terms
of
actual
robbing
of
the
bank,
of
course
not.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
there
are
many
who
tried
to
do
it
in
private.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
surely,
it
does.
i
had
a
different
impression
of
what
had
been
troubling
the
other
justices.
i
think
i
can
say
no
more
to
it
and
it
maybe
in
a
sense
twisting
the
court’s
language
in
reynolds
and
sims.
the
court
said
that
legislatures
represent
the
people,
not
houses
or
trees,
or
i
might
add
dogs
or
bears.
and
in
giving
that
hypothetical,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
one
thinks
about
it
carefully,
one
would
reach
the
conclusion
that
those
laws
are
there
not
to
make
the
behavior
of
the
dogs
and
bears
criminal,
but
to
protect
certain
human
sensibilities.
and
this
is
an
area
of
traditional
regulation,
just
as
obscenity
regulation.
it's
an
area
of
traditional
regulation,
and
one
then
does
get
to
the
question,
is
it
important
that
this
on
film
as
distinct
to
in
a
live
performance?
and
i
think
the
answer
there
is
no,
it
is
not.
this
court’s
opinion
last
year
in
shack
gave
no
indication
that
it
would
have
reached
the
different
question,
would
have
reached
the
different
conclusion,
had
that
been
a
film
the
gorilla
theater
episode,
rather
than
a
gorilla
theater
episode.
indeed,
if
anything
film
performances
can
be
even
more
intrusive
in
a
sense
to
the
society’s
sensibilities
in
a
way
one
has
to
deal
with--in
a
stage
production.
one
has
to
deal
with
a
situation
which
is
necessarily
human
and
in
a
real
sense
remote.
there's
only
so
close
that
you
can
get
to
the
stage.
in
a
film
performance
with
the
possibilities
of
staging,
close
ups
and
what
have
you.
but
these
difficulties
or
i
think
really
very
substantially
aggravated.
when
we
come
to
the
question
how
we’re
going
to
understand
stanley.
the
government
believes
that
the
court
meant
what
it
said,
when
it
said
that
stanley
was
a
holding
limited
to
its
fact.
and
it
did
not
impair
the
validity
of
roth
for
any
commercial
setting,
as
we’ve
called
the
court’s
attention
before.
and
there
is
much
reference
in
that
opinion
to
notions
of
privacy
and
freedoms
from
intrusion
and
we
feel
those
references
are
central.
and
the
opinions
quotes
at
length
from
mr.
justice
brandeis’s
dissent
in
olmstead.
it
refers
to
the
griswold
opinion,
griswold
versus
connecticut,
where
the
court
put
it
this
way.
the
present
case
concerns
a
relationship
lying
within
the
zone
of
privacy,
created
by
several
fundamental
constitutional
guarantees.
and
it
concerns
a
law,
which
in
forbidding
the
use
of
contraceptive,
rather
than
regulating
their
manufacture
or
sale
seeks
to
achieve
its
goals
by
means
having
a
maximum
disruptive
impact
upon
that
relationship.
stanley
is
an
entirely
similar
case.
it
is
a
case
in
which
the
state
sought
to
regulate
in
a
manner
having
a
maximum
destructive
impact
and
this
court,
i
think
quite
properly
said
that
it
might
not
do
so.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
there
are
three
basically.
there
are
two,
which
were
expressed,
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment,
and
the
third,
which
was
not
expressed,
the
fourth
amendment.
and
i
think
the
fourth
amendment
centrality
is
made
clear
by
the
reference
to
olmstead,
by
the
reference
to
notions
of
privacy,
that
the
stress
really
on
privacy
as
a
coordinate
part
of
the
opinion
in
that
case.
in
a
way
i
think
it's
central
to
the
stanley
opinion,
that
unlike
the
other
obscenity
decisions
in
this
court,
the
opinion
does
not
talk
about
the
material.
the
opinion
refers
to
the
rights
of
the
person
and
not
to
the
protected
character
of
the
material
or
not.
and
when
one
starts
talking
about
the
individual
rather
than
what
he
may
have
and
the
individual's
first
amendment
rights,
it
wasn’t
that
the
material
was
protected
under
the
first
amendment,
but
that
the
individual
had
first
amendment
rights.
then
it
becomes,
i
think
clear
that
what
we
are
dealing
with.
again,
citation
to
griswold
is
a
kind
of
penumbral
analysis,
which
we
try
and
set
out
in
our
brief,
that
to
protect
the
individual’s
rights
to
read,
to
learn,
it
is
necessary
to
afford
a
kind
of
penumbral
protection
in
which
the
matters
which
may
not
contain
information,
may
not
contain
ideas
are
nonetheless
ignored.
and
again,
i
think
the
court
was
very
careful,
while
it
did
refer
to
a
right
to
receive
information
and
ideas.
it
never
once
said
that
the
material,
which
he
had
was
material
which
contained
information
and
ideas.
if
it
had
said
that,
then
it
would’ve
been
saying
that
that
material
had
first
amendment
protection.
it
didn’t
say
that--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
would
have
to
agree--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
would
have
to
agree
that
fourth
amendment
was
not
mentioned.
when
however--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
and
the
first
amendment
was,
when--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
when
however
privacy
of
the
home,
notions
of
privacy
are
referred
to
as
frequently
as
they
were
in
that
opinion.
one
must
believe
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
involved.
and
in
any
event,
when
the
opinions
so
carefully
discusses
the
right
of
the
individual,
rather
than
the
nature
of
the
material.
i
think
one
must
be
quite
clear
that
the
holding
was
not
holding,
that
these
materials
were
in
any
sense
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
and
it
was
a
holding
that
the
individual,
in
his
home
was
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
and
that
to
us
is
really
central.
mr.
stanley
did
not
advertise
to
the
world
what
he
had
in
his
bedroom.
as
the
facts
of
the
case
show,
the
police
had
no
reason
to
suspect
what
they
might
find.
he
kept
it
private,
as
long
as
he
did
so,
society
could
claim
no
greater
interest
in
what
was
there,
than
the
supervision
of
his
own
personal
morals.
that
this
court
said
was
not
enough,
and
i
think
the
court
was
quite
plainly
correct
in
doing
so.
but,
here
there's
no
such
privacy.
appellees
proclaimed
to
the
world
what
maybe
seen
in
the
theater,
however
discretely
they
may
do
it.
and
that
notoriety
in
itself
changes
the
issue
from
an
issue
of
private
morality
to
an
issue
of
public
morality.
because
the
contents
of
the
film
and
its
location
are
known
to
the
public,
the
government
must
not
only
tolerate,
but
in
an
important
sense,
legitimize
that
film.
and
if
the
film
is
obscene
and
now
we
have
to
talk
about
the
first
amendment
protection
of
the
materials,
not
the
man,
if
the
film
is
obscene,
we
submit
that
government
can't
be
required
to
do
that.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
those
persons
would
be
completely
protected
under
stanley.
the
film
would
not
be
protected.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
that’s
true,
but
while
these
matters
are
subtle,
i
think
that
one
has
to
be
very
careful
just
because
of
the
risk
of
the
kind
of
emanations,
which
one
finds
in
the
lower
court
opinions
today.
the
lower
courts,
rather
carelessly
i
think
have
treated
that
opinion
is
going
to
the
material.
i'm
treating
the
opinion
as
going
to
the
material,
they
have
said,
well,
if
an
individual
can
have
the
material,
then
somebody
has
to
have
the
right
to
sell
it
to
him,
and
therefore,
as
long
as
he
sells
it
to
whom
in
a
proper
way,
everything
is
alright.
i
think
as
we
read
the
opinion
rather,
one
would
say
in
the
circumstance
of
an
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right.
as
we
read
the
stanley
opinion,
and
one
would
have
to
say,
rather
that
in
the
circumstances
of
an
individual,
having
a
book
or
a
film
in
his
house,
which
no
one
knows
about,
the
only
interest
of
the
state
in
regulating
his
conduct,
is
an
interest
in
private
morality.
and
that,
in
those
circumstances,
in
the
context
of
the
first
amendment,
in
the
necessity
under
griswold
of
a
penumbral
protection
for
those
rights,
simply
is
not
enough.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
in
fact,
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
20
minutes
that
i
was
allotted
by
the
court
have
expired
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
alright.
i
think
the
only
thing
that
i
would
wish
to
note
on
the
issue
of
griswold
versus
connecticut,
counsel
sought
to
bring
that
case
to
this
aid,
as
certainly
of
the
statute
involved
in
that
case
where
a
statute
prohibiting
birth
control
clinics,
we
would
be
in
for
much
harder
time
of
relying
on
it.
the
statute
involved
in
that
case
was
a
statute
which
prohibited
married
couples
from
using
contraceptives.
this
court
struck
down
that
statute
in
a
prosecution
against
the
directors
of
the
clinics
as
aiders
and
abettors
under
that
statute.
and
in
doing
so
and
used
the
language
that
i
quoted,
the
reasoning
which
had
been
found
not
only
in
that
opinion
but
in
ultimately
prevailing
dissent
of
mr.
justice
harlan
in
poe
versus
ullman
and
i
think
again,
that
that
is
the
central
issue
in
stanley
that
the
state
is
invading
the
stanley
facts,
the
state
is
invading
a
completely
private
realm.
here
we
are
dealing
with
public
conduct
and
because
it
is
public
conduct
no
matter
how
carefully
guarded
it
may
be,
there
are
at
least
some
sorts
of
materials
which
the
state
may
prevent
from
appearing
in
the
course
of
that
conduct,
thank
you.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
court
knows,
the
government
appears
here
today
only
with
respect
to
the
issues
in
this
case,
involving
the
meaning
of
its
decision
two
terms
ago
in
stanley
versus
georgia
and
as
the
court
knows
that
decision
has
led
to
a
good
deal
of
ferment
in
this
general
area,
including
the
invalidation
of
two
central
federal
statutes,
which
we
shall
be
appearing
here
later
in
the
term
to
defend.
the
facts
of
stanley
and
we
think
are
significant.
the
police
almost
by
accident
searching
through
an
individual’s
home
for
other
purposes
came
upon
three
reels
of
motion
pictures
and
some
other
items,
which
no
one
knew
were
there,
looked
through
those
films
and
concluded
that
they
were
obscene,
arrested
mr.
stanley
for
possession
of
obscene
matter,
under
georgia’s
statute,
which
permitted
punishment
for
that
purpose.
the
case
came
here
and
the
court
held
and
what
i
think
was
carefully
limited
language
that
the
mere
possession
of
obscene
matter
cannot
constitutionally
be
made
a
crime.
that
formula
--
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
none
whatsoever,
to
us
the
central
fact
and
stanley
really
was
the
very
accidental
nature.
no
one
knew
that
mr.
stanley
had
that
material
or
certainly
no
one
in
the
general
public
knew
that
before
it
was
discovered
by
happenstance
in
his
desk.
well,
it's
not
quite
happenstance,
the
officers
were
there
searching
for
other
materials.
they
certainly
didn’t
expect
to
find
that.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
don’t
think
it's
necessary,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
go
so
far
to
be
as
gentle
with
stanley
as
to
say
that
the
issue
of
pandering
wasn’t
in
that
case.
i
would
put
it
the
issue
of
public
knowledge
was
not
in
that
case.
and
this
court,
i
think
was
quite
careful
in
its
statement,
regarding
that
case,
to
indicate
that
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
private
possession
that
was
before
and
that
that
was
all
that
the
holding
meant.
lower
courts
however,
have
not
been
so
minded
about
the
opinion.
there
is
as
the
court
knows
and
i'm
sure
this
court
feels
that
a
good
deal
of
impatience
about
this
very
troublesome
issue
of
obscenity.
and
there
are
in
the
opinion
here
and
there
remarks
which
could
be
take
in
the
way
that
court
below
here
has
taken
them.
that
if
one
is
careful,
if
one
restricts
access
to
the
movie
to
those
who
want
to
see
it.
and
to
those
who
are
adult
enough,
so
that
ordinary
parens
patriae,
considerations
do
not
come
into
effect.
and
if
one
doesn’t
offend
sensibilities
by
advertising,
well,
then
one
has
a
constitutional
right
to
show
the
movie,
to
commercially
exploit
it.
and
again,
since
the
chief
justice
has
brought
it
up,
i
want
to
stress
that
we
aren’t
talking
here
about
commercial
exploitation,
in
the
sense
of
the
ginsburg
case
in
a
pandering
sense,
simply
public
sale,
unadorned
by
any
kind
of
special
attention
on
the
hypothesis
of
this
case
to
the
sexual
aspects
or
the
sexually
provocative
aspects
of
the
film.
i
should
like
to
start
my
discussion
a
little
way
off
in
the
obscenity
question,
but
in
a
way
that
i
think
again,
calls
attention
to
this
central
character
of
public
knowledge
of
what's
going
on.
let
us
suppose
that
a
traveling
carnival
should
come
to
washington.
setup
tents,
which
are
perfectly
well
enclosed
and
screened
from
public
view
and
announce
that
in
those
tents,
for
those
who
wish
to
pay
and
come
and
see
it,
there
will
be
a
bearbaiting
contest
in
which
five
dogs
and
a
chained
bear
will
be
set
against
each
other,
until
some
or
all
of
the
participants
are
dead.
let's
suppose
that
that
could
be
done
in
perfect
safety
for
all
of
the
viewers.
i
think
that
it
maybe
perfectly
clear
that
no
one
would
leave
that
tent
to
commit
an
act
of
violence.
and
i
think
it
may
also
be
clear
that
no
one
who
would
wish
not
to
see
the
scene
in
the
tent
would
be
forced
to
do
so.
but
i
submit
it's
also
clear
that
the
community
to
which
that
carnival
came
could
prohibit
it,
if
it
were
so
minded,
and
that’s
a
public
policy
question
on
which
all
might
not
agree.
but,
i
think
if
the
community
decided
to
prohibit
that
show,
it
could
do
so.
the
distress
which
is
caused
to
those
who
don’t
come,
but
who
know
what's
going
to
go
on
in
the
tent,
who
know
for
a
certainty
what
will
appear
and
that
is
a
very
real
distress.
the
long
term
brutalization
of
society,
which
the
society
may
fear
will
result.
the
strain
on
social
fabric
through
public
tolerance
of
what
is
to
many
members
of
that
society
utterly
repellent.
all
of
these
factors
would
seem
to
me
to
justify
such
regulation.
it
has
never
been
held
that
society
lacks
power
to
protect
the
sensibilities
or
to
deal
with
these
occurrences,
that
it
must
not
only
tolerate,
but
in
a
meaningful
sense
legitimize
these
activities.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
i
think
it
would
be
as
clear.
it's
inconceivable
to
me
that
the
court
would
extend
less
protection
to
a
theatrical
performance
than
it
does
to
film,
just
because
the
performance
happened
to
be
live,
rather
than
preserved
on
acetate.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
but
neither
would
a
stage
production.
in
a
bank
robbery,
i
think
and
i
tried
to
select
the
hypothetical
carefully.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right,
well
that
no
offense
against
the
law.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
for
the
bears
and
the
dogs.
excuse
me,
for
the
bears
and
the
dogs,
they
commit
no
crime.
there
is
this
offense
of
cruelty
to
animals,
which
i
think
is
what
you're
referring
to.
but
i
think
that
is
an
entirely
analogous
offense
to
the
obscenity
offense.
it
is
an
offense
designed
to
protect
human
sensibilities.
the
dogs
and
the
bears
that
may
survive
the
fighting
aren’t
in
any
sense
punished.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
my
answer
is--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
wouldn’t
say
justice
marshall,
and
i
suppose
it's
not
really
important
to
do
so,
as
i
just
stated,
i
don’t
think
it
would
make
any
difference,
whatsoever,
if
bonnie
and
clyde
were
presented
on
the
stage,
rather
than
in
the
form
of
a
movie
picture,
that’s
part
of
my
point.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
don’t
think
it's
necessary
for
me
to
say
so.
i
personally
wouldn’t
think
so,
but
i
don’t
think
that’s
important
here.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i'm
afraid
i
don’t
see
the
direction--i
don’t
see
what
you're
getting
at--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
suppose
such
statutes
have
been
generally
thought
to
be
more
difficult
to
administer,
without
saying
whether
it
was
bonnie
and
clyde,
in
particular,
i
suppose
if
there
were
a
statute,
which
could
be
sufficiently,
carefully
drawn
as
to
which
one
could
make
the
conclusion
that
was
made
in
roth,
regarding
obscenity
legislation
that
it
is
not
vague
that
a
state
could
indeed
prohibit
the
screen
depiction
of
certain
forms
of
carnage,
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
that’s
the
matter
of
the
court,
at
least
the
forms
of
conduct
that
are
coming
to
mind
maybe
a
matter
that
the
court
hasn’t
yet
decided.
i
may
say,
it
maybe
my
fault,
i
have
the
feeling
of
having
gotten
into
somewhat
of
an
alley.
i
am
not
trying
to
draw
any
distinction
here
between
conduct
on
the
one
hand
and
representations
of
conduct
on
the
other
hand.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
certainly
true,
but
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
in
terms
of
actual
robbing
of
the
bank,
of
course
not.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
there
are
many
who
tried
to
do
it
in
private.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
surely,
it
does.
i
had
a
different
impression
of
what
had
been
troubling
the
other
justices.
i
think
i
can
say
no
more
to
it
and
it
maybe
in
a
sense
twisting
the
court’s
language
in
reynolds
and
sims.
the
court
said
that
legislatures
represent
the
people,
not
houses
or
trees,
or
i
might
add
dogs
or
bears.
and
in
giving
that
hypothetical,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
one
thinks
about
it
carefully,
one
would
reach
the
conclusion
that
those
laws
are
there
not
to
make
the
behavior
of
the
dogs
and
bears
criminal,
but
to
protect
certain
human
sensibilities.
and
this
is
an
area
of
traditional
regulation,
just
as
obscenity
regulation.
it's
an
area
of
traditional
regulation,
and
one
then
does
get
to
the
question,
is
it
important
that
this
on
film
as
distinct
to
in
a
live
performance?
and
i
think
the
answer
there
is
no,
it
is
not.
this
court’s
opinion
last
year
in
shack
gave
no
indication
that
it
would
have
reached
the
different
question,
would
have
reached
the
different
conclusion,
had
that
been
a
film
the
gorilla
theater
episode,
rather
than
a
gorilla
theater
episode.
indeed,
if
anything
film
performances
can
be
even
more
intrusive
in
a
sense
to
the
society’s
sensibilities
in
a
way
one
has
to
deal
with--in
a
stage
production.
one
has
to
deal
with
a
situation
which
is
necessarily
human
and
in
a
real
sense
remote.
there's
only
so
close
that
you
can
get
to
the
stage.
in
a
film
performance
with
the
possibilities
of
staging,
close
ups
and
what
have
you.
but
these
difficulties
or
i
think
really
very
substantially
aggravated.
when
we
come
to
the
question
how
we’re
going
to
understand
stanley.
the
government
believes
that
the
court
meant
what
it
said,
when
it
said
that
stanley
was
a
holding
limited
to
its
fact.
and
it
did
not
impair
the
validity
of
roth
for
any
commercial
setting,
as
we’ve
called
the
court’s
attention
before.
and
there
is
much
reference
in
that
opinion
to
notions
of
privacy
and
freedoms
from
intrusion
and
we
feel
those
references
are
central.
and
the
opinions
quotes
at
length
from
mr.
justice
brandeis’s
dissent
in
olmstead.
it
refers
to
the
griswold
opinion,
griswold
versus
connecticut,
where
the
court
put
it
this
way.
the
present
case
concerns
a
relationship
lying
within
the
zone
of
privacy,
created
by
several
fundamental
constitutional
guarantees.
and
it
concerns
a
law,
which
in
forbidding
the
use
of
contraceptive,
rather
than
regulating
their
manufacture
or
sale
seeks
to
achieve
its
goals
by
means
having
a
maximum
disruptive
impact
upon
that
relationship.
stanley
is
an
entirely
similar
case.
it
is
a
case
in
which
the
state
sought
to
regulate
in
a
manner
having
a
maximum
destructive
impact
and
this
court,
i
think
quite
properly
said
that
it
might
not
do
so.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
there
are
three
basically.
there
are
two,
which
were
expressed,
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment,
and
the
third,
which
was
not
expressed,
the
fourth
amendment.
and
i
think
the
fourth
amendment
centrality
is
made
clear
by
the
reference
to
olmstead,
by
the
reference
to
notions
of
privacy,
that
the
stress
really
on
privacy
as
a
coordinate
part
of
the
opinion
in
that
case.
in
a
way
i
think
it's
central
to
the
stanley
opinion,
that
unlike
the
other
obscenity
decisions
in
this
court,
the
opinion
does
not
talk
about
the
material.
the
opinion
refers
to
the
rights
of
the
person
and
not
to
the
protected
character
of
the
material
or
not.
and
when
one
starts
talking
about
the
individual
rather
than
what
he
may
have
and
the
individual's
first
amendment
rights,
it
wasn’t
that
the
material
was
protected
under
the
first
amendment,
but
that
the
individual
had
first
amendment
rights.
then
it
becomes,
i
think
clear
that
what
we
are
dealing
with.
again,
citation
to
griswold
is
a
kind
of
penumbral
analysis,
which
we
try
and
set
out
in
our
brief,
that
to
protect
the
individual’s
rights
to
read,
to
learn,
it
is
necessary
to
afford
a
kind
of
penumbral
protection
in
which
the
matters
which
may
not
contain
information,
may
not
contain
ideas
are
nonetheless
ignored.
and
again,
i
think
the
court
was
very
careful,
while
it
did
refer
to
a
right
to
receive
information
and
ideas.
it
never
once
said
that
the
material,
which
he
had
was
material
which
contained
information
and
ideas.
if
it
had
said
that,
then
it
would’ve
been
saying
that
that
material
had
first
amendment
protection.
it
didn’t
say
that--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
would
have
to
agree--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
would
have
to
agree
that
fourth
amendment
was
not
mentioned.
when
however--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
and
the
first
amendment
was,
when--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
when
however
privacy
of
the
home,
notions
of
privacy
are
referred
to
as
frequently
as
they
were
in
that
opinion.
one
must
believe
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
involved.
and
in
any
event,
when
the
opinions
so
carefully
discusses
the
right
of
the
individual,
rather
than
the
nature
of
the
material.
i
think
one
must
be
quite
clear
that
the
holding
was
not
holding,
that
these
materials
were
in
any
sense
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
and
it
was
a
holding
that
the
individual,
in
his
home
was
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
and
that
to
us
is
really
central.
mr.
stanley
did
not
advertise
to
the
world
what
he
had
in
his
bedroom.
as
the
facts
of
the
case
show,
the
police
had
no
reason
to
suspect
what
they
might
find.
he
kept
it
private,
as
long
as
he
did
so,
society
could
claim
no
greater
interest
in
what
was
there,
than
the
supervision
of
his
own
personal
morals.
that
this
court
said
was
not
enough,
and
i
think
the
court
was
quite
plainly
correct
in
doing
so.
but,
here
there's
no
such
privacy.
appellees
proclaimed
to
the
world
what
maybe
seen
in
the
theater,
however
discretely
they
may
do
it.
and
that
notoriety
in
itself
changes
the
issue
from
an
issue
of
private
morality
to
an
issue
of
public
morality.
because
the
contents
of
the
film
and
its
location
are
known
to
the
public,
the
government
must
not
only
tolerate,
but
in
an
important
sense,
legitimize
that
film.
and
if
the
film
is
obscene
and
now
we
have
to
talk
about
the
first
amendment
protection
of
the
materials,
not
the
man,
if
the
film
is
obscene,
we
submit
that
government
can't
be
required
to
do
that.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
those
persons
would
be
completely
protected
under
stanley.
the
film
would
not
be
protected.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
that’s
true,
but
while
these
matters
are
subtle,
i
think
that
one
has
to
be
very
careful
just
because
of
the
risk
of
the
kind
of
emanations,
which
one
finds
in
the
lower
court
opinions
today.
the
lower
courts,
rather
carelessly
i
think
have
treated
that
opinion
is
going
to
the
material.
i'm
treating
the
opinion
as
going
to
the
material,
they
have
said,
well,
if
an
individual
can
have
the
material,
then
somebody
has
to
have
the
right
to
sell
it
to
him,
and
therefore,
as
long
as
he
sells
it
to
whom
in
a
proper
way,
everything
is
alright.
i
think
as
we
read
the
opinion
rather,
one
would
say
in
the
circumstance
of
an
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right.
as
we
read
the
stanley
opinion,
and
one
would
have
to
say,
rather
that
in
the
circumstances
of
an
individual,
having
a
book
or
a
film
in
his
house,
which
no
one
knows
about,
the
only
interest
of
the
state
in
regulating
his
conduct,
is
an
interest
in
private
morality.
and
that,
in
those
circumstances,
in
the
context
of
the
first
amendment,
in
the
necessity
under
griswold
of
a
penumbral
protection
for
those
rights,
simply
is
not
enough.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
in
fact,
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
20
minutes
that
i
was
allotted
by
the
court
have
expired
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
alright.
i
think
the
only
thing
that
i
would
wish
to
note
on
the
issue
of
griswold
versus
connecticut,
counsel
sought
to
bring
that
case
to
this
aid,
as
certainly
of
the
statute
involved
in
that
case
where
a
statute
prohibiting
birth
control
clinics,
we
would
be
in
for
much
harder
time
of
relying
on
it.
the
statute
involved
in
that
case
was
a
statute
which
prohibited
married
couples
from
using
contraceptives.
this
court
struck
down
that
statute
in
a
prosecution
against
the
directors
of
the
clinics
as
aiders
and
abettors
under
that
statute.
and
in
doing
so
and
used
the
language
that
i
quoted,
the
reasoning
which
had
been
found
not
only
in
that
opinion
but
in
ultimately
prevailing
dissent
of
mr.
justice
harlan
in
poe
versus
ullman
and
i
think
again,
that
that
is
the
central
issue
in
stanley
that
the
state
is
invading
the
stanley
facts,
the
state
is
invading
a
completely
private
realm.
here
we
are
dealing
with
public
conduct
and
because
it
is
public
conduct
no
matter
how
carefully
guarded
it
may
be,
there
are
at
least
some
sorts
of
materials
which
the
state
may
prevent
from
appearing
in
the
course
of
that
conduct,
thank
you.
