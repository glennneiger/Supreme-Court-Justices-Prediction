justice
potter
stewart
but
those
issues
will
get
here
as
to
the
state
courts,
won't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
switch.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
you're
right
--
if
you're
right
in
what
you've
just
told
us
then
it
would
be
quite
wrong
for
this
court
in
this
case
at
this
time
to
give
that
sure
guidance
that
you
feel
so
much
the
need
of.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there's
nothing
--
of
course
there's
nothing
wrong
and
nothing
impermissible
about
you're
making
alternative
arguments
but
if
you
do
prevail
on
this
argument
you
just
made
to
us
then
that's
the
end
of
the
case
then
we
obviously
don't
get
in
to
the
merits
of
the
substance
of
the
merits
of
this
particular
movie
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
did
i
understand
from
scanning
your
brief
that
at
least
one
federal
court
i
think
in
california
has
held
this
federal
legislation
or
part
of
it
constitutionally
invalid
based
on
stanley.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
the
importation
statute
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
weren't
any
federal
obscenity
laws
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
the
books
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
written
because
there
was
no
federal
government
until
the
constitution
was
ratified.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
first
amendment
is
directed
only
at
governing
what
the
federal
government
can
do.
at
least
that
was
true
until
the
fourteenth
amendment
came
along.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
but
where
would
he
have
acquired
this
book?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
you're
saying
it
matters
very
much
where
you
acquired
it,
don't
you?
how
would
you
suggest
that
he
would
have
gain
possession
on
this
book
that
he
has
an
absolute
constitutional
right
to
possess?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
you
almost
have
to
have
written
it
himself,
wouldn't
he,
under
your
theory.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
you're
telling
us.
it's
illegal
or
can
be
made
illegal
and
it
has
been
made
illegal
by
the
states
or
federal
government
for
one
mr.
stanley
to
sell
or
give
the
book
to
another
mr.
stanley
which
mr.
stanley
found
that
he
has
to
create
his
own.
justice
potter
stewart
suggesting
it,
would
be
of
kind
of
an
empty
right
and
that
the
court
in
stanley
have
been
spending
a
lot
of
time
writing
a
very
eloquent
opinion
about
almost
nothing
at
all
if
the
right
of
possession
of
something
doesn't
involved
or
bring
in
its
train
the
right
to
acquire
it.
justice
potter
stewart
the
absolute
constitutional
right
that
was
up
held
in
stanley.
justice
potter
stewart
or
somebody
might
have
mailed
it
to
him.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
show
where
he
got
that
film.
justice
potter
stewart
stanley
--
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
stanley
as
i
understood
it.
i
did
not
join
it
as
you
know
is
based
on
the
first
amendment
of
the
separate
opinion
in
that
case
which
i
do
know
something
about
and
we've
written
it
was
based
on
the
fourth
amendment
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
was
no
part
at
all
of
the
district
court's
reasoning.
justice
potter
stewart
they've
considered
on
the
hypothesis
that
this
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
when
i
read
it,
i
don't
know
how
finally
i
read
it
but
i
read
it
carefully.
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
state
prosecutions
had
there
actually
been,
one
or
two?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what's
their
status
now?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
guess
they're
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
this
district
court
issued
an
injunction
and
that
injunction
has
been
stayed,
has
it
not,
by
us?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
therefore
brings
us
back
to
the
situation
that
existed
before
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
by
the
district
court
which
you
said
was
an
intolerable
situation
because
you
are
going
to
be
prosecuted
everyday,
what
in
fact
--
the
fact
is
now
you're
not
exhibiting
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
your
--
that's
your
choice
isn't
it,
whether
or
not
you
exhibit
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
this
is
a
fortiori
from
dombrowski,
as
i
understand
your
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
and
yet
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
dombrowski,
the
allegations
were
that
it
was
deliberate
pattern
and
course
of
harassment
and
abuse
of
a
statute
and
a
bad
faith
course
of
conduct
here
and
i
don't
understand
that
there's
any
such
a
claims
at
all.
there's
no
claim
of
bad
faith,
there's
no
claim
of
deliberate
harassment,
there's
simply
a
prediction
of
good
faith
enforcement
by
the
prosecutor
of
law
of
massachusetts
makes
quite
different
from
dombrowski,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
have
chilled
into
death.
justice
potter
stewart
quinn,
i'm
--
perhaps
it's
been
made
clear
but
if
so,
i
missed
it.
what
is
the
posture
of
the
state
prosecution
now
in
the
massachusetts
court?
there
has
been
a
conviction
on
its
own
appeal.
justice
potter
stewart
the
october
sitting.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
status
of
the
proceedings
if
any,
in
the
state
courts?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
a
conviction
in
the
suffolk
county
superior
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
an
appeal
to
the
highest
court
of
your
state.
justice
potter
stewart
postponement
of
the
oral
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
postponement
on
the
entire
oral
argument,
i
gather,
wasn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
that’s
--
is
that
by
formal
order
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts?
justice
potter
stewart
postponed
pending
a
decision
by
this
court,
in
this
case?
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
resist
the
motion?
justice
potter
stewart
but
was
there
anything
in
the
order
of
the
--
or
action
of
the
three-judge
united
states
district
court
or
in
any
order
or
action
of
this
court
that
prohibited
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
from
proceeding
to
a
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
its
own
independent
action
on
motion
of
the
appellees
here.
justice
potter
stewart
they
do
if
what?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
understand
as
of
now,
the
oral
argument
has
been
postponed,
until
after
the
decision
of
this
court,
in
these
proceedings.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
your
hypothetical
would
be
quite
so
clear,
if
it
were
shown
inside
the
tent
or
a
movie
of
a
bearbaiting
contest
or
are
you
going
to
be
getting
to
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
community,
most
communities
do,
make
bank
robbery
a
criminal
offense.
but,
would
a
movie
showing
a
bank
robbery
be
a
criminal
offense
--
an
offense
on
the
part
of
the
television
producer?
justice
potter
stewart
we’re
talking
about
the
bears
and
dogs
killing
each
other,
aren’t
we?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it's
not
an
offense,
you
hypothesized
[voice
overlap]
justice
potter
stewart
on
what
provision
of
the
united
states
constitution
do
you
understand
the
stanley
decision
to
have
been
based?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don’t
have
the
opinion
in
front
of
me,
so
i'm
relying
on
my
recollection,
but
would
you
disagree
that
so
far
as
explicit
articulation
went
at
least,
the
decision
was
bottomed
on
the
first
amendment,
made
applicable
to
the
state
of
georgia,
at
least
for
the
fourteenth?
justice
potter
stewart
isn’t
that
what
the
court
said?[voice
overlap]
justice
potter
stewart
specific
supervision
of
the
united
states
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
but,
in
the
first
amendment
was--
justice
potter
stewart
and
mentioned
as
rather
euphemism.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
it
doesn’t
enjoin
future
prosecution?
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
think
the
language
on
page
44
means?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
you
are
referring
as
to
the
order?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
you
made
a
statement
which
i
wholly
agree
that’s
the
order
that’s
being
reviewed
here.
justice
potter
stewart
does
massachusetts
have
a
declaratory
judgment
procedure?
justice
potter
stewart
your
theory
is
that
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
proceedings
gave
it
kind
of
license
a
federal
license
that
under
the
supremacy
clause
or
for
some
other
reason
had
to
be
honored
in
every
state
or
county,
is
that
basically
your
theory?
justice
potter
stewart
i’m
just
asking
about
your
theory
of
this.
justice
potter
stewart
well
what’s
your
rule
dependent
on
that’s
my
question.
what’s
the
rationale
that
supported
your
submitted
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
have
still
trouble
understanding
the
rationale
in
support
of
the
rule.
i
understand
the
rule
that
you
submit
but
i
don’t
understand
the
reasoning
that
supports
it,
apart
from
what
i
try
to
verbalize.
justice
potter
stewart
to
get
sort
of
a
federal
license.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
paramount
to
any
attack
of
the
state.
justice
potter
stewart
--
a
federal
pilot’s
license
and
then
you
can
go
on
every
directional
through
intrastate
waters.
justice
potter
stewart
general
quinn
it’s
not
entirely
clear
in
my
mind
as
to
when
this
five-and-a
half
month
period
came
chronologically
in
this
litigation
when
you
say
this
film
was
really
shown
to
us?
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
period
and
i
understood
mr.
lewin
to
say,
and
you
would
agree,
if
i
understood
it
correctly
that
with
respect
to
a
moving
picture
film,
there
is
not
just
(inaudible)
as
contrasted
with
a
book.
justice
potter
stewart
but
those
issues
will
get
here
as
to
the
state
courts,
won't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
switch.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
you're
right
--
if
you're
right
in
what
you've
just
told
us
then
it
would
be
quite
wrong
for
this
court
in
this
case
at
this
time
to
give
that
sure
guidance
that
you
feel
so
much
the
need
of.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there's
nothing
--
of
course
there's
nothing
wrong
and
nothing
impermissible
about
you're
making
alternative
arguments
but
if
you
do
prevail
on
this
argument
you
just
made

then
that's
the
end
of
the
case
then
we
obviously
don't
get
in
to
the

of
this
particular

at

justice
potter

did
i

at

in
california
has
held

justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
the
importation

(voice

justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
weren't
any
federal
obscenity
laws
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
the
books
at
the
time
the
constitution
was

and
the

at

that
was
true
until
the
fourteenth

came

justice

stewart
yeah,
but
where
would
he
have
acquired
this
book?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
you're
saying
it
matters
very
much
where
you
acquired
it,
don't
you?
how
would
you
suggest
that
he
would
have
gain
possession
on
this
book
that
he
has
an
absolute
constitutional
right
to
possess?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
you
almost
have
to
have
written
it
himself,
wouldn't
he,
under
your
theory.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
you're
telling
us.
it's
illegal
or
can
be
made
illegal
and
it
has
been
made
illegal
by
the
states
or
federal
government
for
one
mr.
stanley
to
sell
or
give
the
book
to
another
mr.
stanley
which
mr.
stanley
found
that
he
has
to
create
his
own.
justice
potter
stewart
suggesting
it,
would
be
of
kind
of
an
empty
right
and
that
the
court
in
stanley
have
been
spending
a
lot
of
time
writing
a
very
eloquent
opinion
about
almost
nothing
at
all
if
the
right
of
possession
of
something
doesn't
involved
or
bring
in
its
train
the
right
to
acquire
it.
justice
potter
stewart
the
absolute
constitutional
right
that
was
up
held
in
stanley.
justice
potter
stewart
or
somebody
might
have
mailed
it
to
him.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
show
where
he
got
that
film.
justice
potter
stewart
stanley
--
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
stanley
as
i
understood
it.
i
did
not
join
it
as
you
know
is
based
on
the
first
amendment
of
the
separate
opinion
in
that
case
which
i
do
know
something
about
and
we've
written
it
was
based
on
the
fourth
amendment
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
was
no
part
at
all
of
the
district
court's
reasoning.
justice
potter
stewart
they've
considered
on
the
hypothesis
that
this
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
when
i
read
it,
i
don't
know
how
finally
i
read
it
but
i
read
it
carefully.
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
state
prosecutions
had
there
actually
been,
one
or
two?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what's
their
status
now?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
guess
they're
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
this
district
court
issued
an
injunction
and
that
injunction
has
been
stayed,
has
it
not,
by
us?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
therefore
brings
us
back
to
the
situation
that
existed
before
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
by
the
district
court
which
you
said
was
an
intolerable
situation
because
you
are
going
to
be
prosecuted
everyday,
what
in
fact
--
the
fact
is
now
you're
not
exhibiting
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
your
--
that's
your
choice
isn't
it,
whether
or
not
you
exhibit
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
this
is
a
fortiori
from
dombrowski,
as
i
understand
your
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
and
yet
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
dombrowski,
the
allegations
were
that
it
was
deliberate
pattern
and
course
of
harassment
and
abuse
of
a
statute
and
a
bad
faith
course
of
conduct
here
and
i
don't
understand
that
there's
any
such
a
claims
at
all.
there's
no
claim
of
bad
faith,
there's
no
claim
of
deliberate
harassment,
there's
simply
a
prediction
of
good
faith
enforcement
by
the
prosecutor
of
law
of
massachusetts
makes
quite
different
from
dombrowski,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
have
chilled
into
death.
justice
potter
stewart
quinn,
i'm
--
perhaps
it's
been
made
clear
but
if
so,
i
missed
it.
what
is
the
posture
of
the
state
prosecution
now
in
the
massachusetts
court?
there
has
been
a
conviction
on
its
own
appeal.
justice
potter
stewart
the
october
sitting.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
status
of
the
proceedings
if
any,
in
the
state
courts?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
a
conviction
in
the
suffolk
county
superior
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
an
appeal
to
the
highest
court
of
your
state.
justice
potter
stewart
postponement
of
the
oral
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
postponement
on
the
entire
oral
argument,
i
gather,
wasn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
that’s
--
is
that
by
formal
order
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts?
justice
potter
stewart
postponed
pending
a
decision
by
this
court,
in
this
case?
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
resist
the
motion?
justice
potter
stewart
but
was
there
anything
in
the
order
of
the
--
or
action
of
the
three-judge
united
states
district
court
or
in
any
order
or
action
of
this
court
that
prohibited
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
from
proceeding
to
a
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
its
own
independent
action
on
motion
of
the
appellees
here.
justice
potter
stewart
they
do
if
what?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
understand
as
of
now,
the
oral
argument
has
been
postponed,
until
after
the
decision
of
this
court,
in
these
proceedings.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
your
hypothetical
would
be
quite
so
clear,
if
it
were
shown
inside
the
tent
or
a
movie
of
a
bearbaiting
contest
or
are
you
going
to
be
getting
to
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
community,
most
communities
do,
make
bank
robbery
a
criminal
offense.
but,
would
a
movie
showing
a
bank
robbery
be
a
criminal
offense
--
an
offense
on
the
part
of
the
television
producer?
justice
potter
stewart
we’re
talking
about
the
bears
and
dogs
killing
each
other,
aren’t
we?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it's
not
an
offense,
you
hypothesized
[voice

justice
potter
stewart
on
what
provision
of
the
united
states
constitution
do
you
understand
the
stanley
decision
to
have
been
based?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don’t
have
the
opinion
in
front
of
me,
so
i'm
relying
on
my
recollection,
but
would
you
disagree
that
so
far
as
explicit
articulation
went
at
least,
the
decision
was
bottomed
on
the
first
amendment,
made
applicable
to
the
state
of
georgia,
at
least
for
the
fourteenth?
justice
potter
stewart
isn’t
that
what
the
court
said?[voice
overlap]
justice
potter
stewart
specific
supervision
of
the
united
states
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
but,
in
the
first
amendment
was--
justice
potter
stewart
and
mentioned
as
rather
euphemism.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
it
doesn’t
enjoin
future
prosecution?
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
think
the
language
on
page
44
means?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
you
are
referring
as
to
the
order?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
you
made
a
statement
which
i
wholly
agree
that’s
the
order
that’s
being
reviewed
here.
justice
potter
stewart
does
massachusetts
have
a
declaratory
judgment
procedure?
justice
potter
stewart
your
theory
is
that
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
proceedings
gave
it
kind
of
license
a
federal
license
that
under
the
supremacy
clause
or
for
some
other
reason
had
to
be
honored
in
every
state
or
county,
is
that
basically
your
theory?
justice
potter
stewart
i’m
just
asking
about
your
theory
of
this.
justice
potter
stewart
well
what’s
your
rule
dependent
on
that’s
my
question.
what’s
the
rationale
that
supported
your
submitted
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
have
still
trouble
understanding
the
rationale
in
support
of
the
rule.
i
understand
the
rule
that
you
submit
but
i
don’t
understand
the
reasoning
that
supports
it,
apart
from
what
i
try
to
verbalize.
justice
potter
stewart
to
get
sort
of
a
federal
license.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
paramount
to
any
attack
of
the
state.
justice
potter
stewart
--
a
federal
pilot’s
license
and
then
you
can
go
on
every
directional
through
intrastate
waters.
justice
potter
stewart
general
quinn
it’s
not
entirely
clear
in
my
mind
as
to
when
this
five-and-a
half
month
period
came
chronologically
in
this
litigation
when
you
say
this
film
was
really
shown
to
us?
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
period
and
i
understood
mr.
lewin
to
say,
and
you
would
agree,
if
i
understood
it
correctly
that
with
respect
to
a
moving
picture
film,
there
is
not
just
(inaudible)
as
contrasted
with
a
book.
