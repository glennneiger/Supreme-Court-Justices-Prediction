if
you
prevail
on
the
first
branch
of
your
case,
why
do
we
get
the
second
point?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
yet
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
the
substantial
and
irreversible
point
though
in
ourselves
that
i
would
say
we
will
do
but
what
was
said
that
our
court
exactly
did,
being
in
the
pair
with
the
state
prosecution.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
know
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
to
argue
this
case
on
some
kind
of
principle
and
not
just
because
it
would
say,
it's
nice
to
have
a
little
certainty
on
time.
justice

prosecuting.
justice
john
m.

the
content
to
stop
at
that
point
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
let
me
put
a
practical
question
to
you
and
this
is
not
suppose
to
be
a
humorous.
now,
what
you're
arguing
now
in
effect
that
showing
effect
on
you
prosecutors,
state
prosecutors
of
the
confusion
that
manifest
to
exists
under
this
court's
decision
and
this
holds
and
it
repealed
nobody
could
belie
that.
now
as
between
that
--
as
between
the
propositions
that
you've
just
argued
namely
the
implications
of
federalism
that
going
into
federal
courts
not
getting
into
restraining
state
enforcement
regardless
from
proceeding
to
enforce
their
own
law
by
letting
individual
constitutional
questions
come
up
to
the
state
system.
what
do
you
think
of
if
you
have
to
look
at
these
two
countervailing
effects,
chilling
effect
of
all
this,
which
do
you
think
is
the
most
important?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
case
you
referred
to
last
week
and
now
is
heard
as
the
premise?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
on
your
latter
proposition
that
we
accepted
it
and
the
case
then
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
that
as
reversed
to
this
as
to
whether
this
is
within
or
without
the
roth
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
we
are
to
bypass
the
court
of
appeals
then
that's
--
i
mean
the
three-judge
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
you
could
say
that
from
the
moment
constitutional
to
your
life
and
it's
not
about
its
attributes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
are
these
matters
--
was
it
in
the
middle
of
this
year?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you're
saying
is
this
is
not
applied
to
any
of
the
three
cases
involved,
you
say
your
question
could
reach
the
dombrowski,
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
dombrowski
issue
and
not
in
2283?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
not
the
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
temporary
injunction
against
further
prosecutions.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it's
called
up
the
state
process
during
that
period.
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
shouldn't
have
done
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
state
court
can't
do
it
but
the
federal
court
can.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
in
that
make
known
stipulation
of
the
state,
the
prosecutor
made
no
statement
or
whatever
but
he
simply
went
around
enforcing
the
laws.
what
would
you
say
then
to
the
propriety
of
the
federal
courts
--?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
what
you're
really
arguing
i
think
is
that
the
peculiar
patterns
of
this
case,
this
is
within
the
four
corners
of
the
dombrowski
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you're
arguing
that
the
looking
apart
from
that
(voice
overlap)
enable
the
federal
courts
to
stop
him
whether
it
was
more
than
at
least
one
prosecution.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
the
behavior
that
results
in
disseminating
the
material.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you
just
shown
that
it
legally
threatened
your
(inaudible)
as
a
matter
of
injunction,
the
official
factions.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
long
does
it
take
for
the
massachusetts
supreme
court
get
the
answer
to
this?
justice
john
m.
harlan
unless
if
you’re
--
what
you’re
saying
on
this
will
never
get
in
to
the
merits
of
the
penalty.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that’d
be
the
merits
on
the
bill
not
from
the
maryland
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what’s
the
statute
of
limitations
on
the
obscenity
prosecutions?
justice
john
m.
harlan
anyway
you
are
probably
saying
that
an
interference
with
the
process
of
state
criminal
prosecution
to
the
extent
that
it
prevents
prosecution
by
the
state.
can
you
escape
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
that’s
the
whole
issue
is,
so
that—i
don’t
quite
understand
your
argument
about
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
operate
then,
very
supposing
the
second
circuit
would
check
the
film,
or
its
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
future
enforcement.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you
