chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
in
number
1149,
byrne
against
karalexis.
mr.
quinn,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
sure
what
difference
it
makes
whether
they're
owner
to
whether
they're
showing
it.
how
does
that
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
want
to
ponder
on
that
counsel
and
give
us
your
response
after
your
lunch?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
quinn,
you
have
had
time
to
ponder.
now,
do
you
want
to
address
yourself
to
justice
harlan's
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
an
addendum
to
that
answer
might
be
that
the
states
did
not
make
that
standards
but
they
have
to
try
to
live
with
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
a
man
operating
a
motor
vehicle
under
the
reckless
driving
laws
has
a
certain
area
that
we
up
here
call
the
penumbra
where
he
might
think
it
was
not
reckless
but
somebody
else,
some
officer
might
think
it
was
reckless.
he
has
to
make
a
difficult
judgment
there
too,
doesn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
pauley.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
agree
mr.
pauley
that
the
guidelines
in
the
antitrust
field
for
example
on
anticompetitive
effect
or
relevant
market
are
perhaps
better
guidelines
more
precise
than
any
that
had
been
afforded
in
obscenity.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
they
are
no
better
or
about
the
same?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
question
was
preliminary
to
the
one
that
i
now
put
to
you.
a
great
many
businessmen
and
expert
antitrust
lawyers
think
they
have
as
much
difficulty
in
understanding
applying
and
interpreting
statutory
standards
and
opinions
of
this
court
on
anticompetitive
effects
of
a
particular
line
of
conduct
or
the
relevant
market
of
a
particular
business
as
exhibitors
and
publishers
do
with
the
obscenity
fields.
would
that
--
do
i
--
do
i
overstate
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
75
no,
76
years
ago,
these
court
divided
almost
four-and-a-half
to
four-and-a-half
on
the
northern
securities
case
or
i
think
it
was
the
predecessor
but
a
couple
of
months
ago,
we
--
without
dissent
affirmed
the
merger
of
the
same
two
railroads.
so
i
suppose
in
the
interval,
there
has
been
a
lot
of
doubt
about
the
problem
of
competition
and
monopoly
in
that
area.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
think
so.
i
think
you
perhaps
overstated
inadvertently
my
position.
i
think
there's
a
difference
but
it's
one
only
of
degree.
i
think
the
publishers
and
exhibitors
maybe
have
a
little
harder
time
of
it.
i'm
sure
they
think
so
which
perhaps
the
businessmen
think
they
have
the
harder
time
of
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
pauley.
mr.
lewin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you're
saying
is
that
one
of
the
speeches
he
wants
to
make,
he
is
afraid
to
make.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
you
lose
money.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that's
the
consequence
to
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lewin,
i
should
tell
you
you're
down
for
about
12
minutes
for
professor
de
grazia.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
professor
de
grazia.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
the
exhibitor
in
that
circumstance
the
appropriate
party
to
vindicate
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
suggest
that
he
is
not.
i
just
raised
that
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
has
the
most
immediate
interest,
immediate
impact.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
--
do
i
get
from
that
to
his
intimation
that
you
concede
that
there
is
some
suppressible
material
that
there
are
some
movies
that
could
be
suppressed
under
a
federal
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
try
again.
i
thought
you
did
concede
explicitly
that
there
is
some
material
which
could
be
suppressed
that
is
it
could
be
so
bad
whatever
that
means
under
the
standards
that
it's
so
bad
that
it
could
be
lawfully
suppressed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
no.
i'm
not
talking
about
this
case.
is
there
some
kind
of
material
which
could
be
suppressed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
of
course
judge
aldrich
and
his
two
colleagues
were
not
absolutely
sure
about
this,
were
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
(voice
overlap)
probable
unconstitutionality
which
is
i
suppose
when
a
judge
uses
that
term,
he
means
something
like
probable
cause.
this
was
probable
cause
in
reverse.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
just
means
that
he
is
going
to
take
it
to
the
grand
jury
or
issue
an
information
charge,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
your
time
is
up
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
professor
de
grazia.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
general
quinn,
you
have
four
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
dombrowski
complicated
it
a
little.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
it
would
be
in
this
calendar
year.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
general
quinn.
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
byrne
against
karalexis,
mr.
quinn
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
i
ask
you
another
question,
mr.
quinn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
record
in
this
case
show
any
proffer
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
massachusetts
of
evidence
tending
to
show
pandering
by
the
type
of
advertising
used,
advertising
to
help
this
film.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
show
anything
in
the
nature
of
evidence
that
in
fact,
minors
were
not
excluded,
that
there
was
no
good
faith
effort
to
keep
them
from
attending?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
were
going
narrowly
on
this
one
central
issue,
independent
of
it
–
the
pandering
or
access
of
minors.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
quinn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
strauss.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
any
showing
in
the
stanley
case
that
the
possession
had
been
for
or
was
intended
for
commercial
profit,
public
showing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
the
issue
of
public
showing
or
pandering
by
advertising
before
public
showing
were
not
involved
in
the
stanley
case
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
strauss,
going
back
to
this
other
earlier
question,
are
there
some
forms
of
conduct,
which
if
they
occur
in
private
are
completely
innocent
and
protected,
but
if
performed
in
public
are
not
protected?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
my
question
is,
precisely,
precisely
directed
at
that,
now,
perfectly
simple
example
is
that
it's
entirely
proper
and
highly
desirable
to
take
a
shower.
and
you
might
find
yourself
arrested,
if
you
took
shower
in
the
center
of
pennsylvania
avenue,
is
that
not
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
if
you,
on
the
other
hand,
you
cannot
rob
a
bank
either
in
private
or
in
public,
with
impunity
can
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
robbing
of
the
bank
is
subject
to
penal
sanctions,
whether
you
do
it
in
the
utmost
of
privacy
in
the
middle
of
the
night
or
at
high
noon
with
a
number
of
spectators.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
that
makes
quite
a
difference
between
bank
robbery
and
some
of
these
other
things,
doesn’t
it,
the
taking
of
a
shower
on
pennsylvania
avenue
at
high
noon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you're
saying
i
take
it
is,
that
if
the
same
film
that
we’re
dealing
with
here
is
possessed
by
private
persons
in
their
homes
with
no
indications
that
they
had
it
for
commercial
purposes
that
it
would
be
completely
protected
under
stanley?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
if
the
persons
were,
they
can't
reach
the
film
as
long
as
it
remains
in
the
house.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’re
referring
to
the
stanley
opinion
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
strauss.
mr.
lewin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
this
question,
if
i
may,
if
the
conduct,
which
is
the
target
of
the
state
of
massachusetts
in
this
case,
occurred
on
pennsylvania
avenue,
would
you
think
that
the
principles
would
have
the
first
amendment
right
or
would
they
be
subject
to
arrest,
trial,
conviction,
and
punishment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’ll
defer
my
question
to
professor
dershowitz
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
mean
six
years
from
the
last
showing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
only
one
we’re
concerned
about
is
six
years
from
the
last
one,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’d
be
a
fact
question
in
each
case,
wouldn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dershowitz.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
general
motors
wouldn’t
make
that
claim
with
reference
to
the
drop
in
its
stock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
pretty
speculative,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
--
i
have
to
interrupt
you
again,
professor
dershowitz.
let
me
ask
you.
did
you
--
would
you
accept
the
postulates
i
think
advanced
by
the
solicitor
general
on
the
bearbaiting,
the
right
of
the
state
to
prohibit
bearbaiting
contest
for
public
exhibition
or
otherwise.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
mind
coming
back
now
to
the
bearbaiting
that
we
were
talking
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
both
involved
in
the
prohibition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
aren’t
both
factors
involved
in
a
statute
which
prohibits
that
kind
of
conduct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
know,
switch
on
the
reality
through
first,
let’s
stay
on
the
live
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
now
are
you
saying
that
it’s
all
right
to
kill
one
bear
and
five
dogs
in
a
filming
process
but
it
isn’t
alright
to
kill
many
more
of
them
in
the
live
showing,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
since
we
agree
on
that,
suppose
it
developed
in
a
particular
case
that
–
no
use
naming
the
states
but
let’s
say
14
states
had
not
enforced,
not
sought
to
enforce
or
didn’t
have
any
statutes
against
bearbaiting,
and
four-and-a-
half
million
people
had
watched
bearbaiting
or
the
filming
of
bearbaiting,
would
that
have
any
slightest
relevance
in
your
judgment
on
whether
the
showing
of
bearbaiting
in
boston,
massachusetts
could
or
could
not
be
stopped
under
massachusetts
statute
by
prohibiting
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
the
14
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
go
back
to
something
you
said
earlier.
are
you
suggesting
that
it
is
a
universal
rule
that
everybody
is
offended
by
bearbaiting
for
example?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suspect
that
great
many
people
would
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
either
go
to
see
it,
wouldn’t
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’re
not
suggesting
either
that
everyone,
100%
would
be
offended
by
public
showering
on
pennsylvania
avenue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
the
fact
that
some
--
that
there
is
a
differing
view
on
these
matters
doesn’t
really
enter
into
it,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
you’ve
introduced
at
least
an
element
that’s
new
to
me.
suppose
the
prosecution
could
demonstrate
that
half
of
the
people
who
saw
the
movie
performance
were
offended
by
it
and
so
testified.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
i
follow
your
thesis
on,
how
about
moving
the
bearbaiting
in
to
the
theater
and
charging
$5.00
admission
for
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don’t
want
to
over
work
to
you
on
the
bearbaiting
but
in
order
to
have
the
film
of
bearbaiting,
you
got
to
go
through
an
unlawful
process
in
the
first
instance,
do
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
unlawful?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
bank
robbery
is
illegal
whether
privately
performed
or
any
other
place
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
analogy
is
valid?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
difference
between
the
showering
on
pennsylvania
avenue
and
the
bank
robbery
of
riggs
bank
is
that
the
showering
on
pennsylvania,
you
say,
is
illegal
but
the
showing
of
it
is
legal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
quinn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
attorney
general.
mr.
strauss
you
--
nothing
to
add?
you
have
a
few
more
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
some
margin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
strauss.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
in
number
1149,
byrne
against
karalexis.
mr.
quinn,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
sure
what
difference
it
makes
whether
they're
owner
to
whether
they're
showing
it.
how
does
that
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
want
to
ponder
on
that
counsel
and
give
us
your
response
after
your
lunch?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
quinn,
you
have
had
time
to
ponder.
now,
do
you
want
to
address
yourself
to
justice
harlan's
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
an
addendum
to
that
answer
might
be
that
the
states
did
not
make
that
standards
but
they
have
to
try
to
live
with
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
a
man
operating
a
motor
vehicle
under
the
reckless
driving
laws
has
a
certain
area
that
we
up
here
call
the
penumbra
where
he
might
think
it
was
not
reckless
but
somebody
else,
some
officer
might
think
it
was
reckless.
he
has
to
make
a
difficult
judgment
there
too,
doesn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
pauley.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
agree
mr.
pauley
that
the
guidelines
in
the
antitrust
field
for
example
on
anticompetitive
effect
or
relevant
market
are
perhaps
better
guidelines
more
precise
than
any
that

afforded
in
obscenity.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
they
are
no
better
or
about
the
same?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
question
was
preliminary
to
the
one
that
i
now
put
to
you.
a
great
many
businessmen
and
expert
antitrust
lawyers
think
they
have
as
much
difficulty
in
understanding
applying
and
interpreting
statutory
standards
and
opinions
of
this
court
on
anticompetitive
effects
of
a
particular
line
of
conduct
or
the
relevant
market
of
a
particular
business
as
exhibitors
and
publishers
do
with
the
obscenity
fields.
would
that
--
do
i
--
do
i
overstate
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
75
no,
76
years
ago,
these
court
divided
almost
four-and-a-half
to
four-and-a-half
on
the
northern
securities
case
or
i
think
it
was
the
predecessor
but
a
couple
of
months

we
--
without

so
i
suppose
in

there
has
been
a
lot
of
doubt
about
the
problem
of
competition
and
monopoly
in
that
area.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
think
so.
i
think
you
perhaps
overstated
inadvertently
my
position.
i
think
there's
a
difference
but
it's
one
only
of
degree.
i
think
the
publishers
and
exhibitors
maybe
have
a
little
harder
time
of
it.
i'm
sure
they
think
so
which
perhaps
the
businessmen
think
they
have
the
harder
time
of
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
pauley.
mr.
lewin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you're
saying
is
that
one
of
the
speeches
he
wants
to
make,
he
is
afraid
to
make.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
you
lose
money.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that's
the
consequence
to
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lewin,
i
should
tell
you
you're
down
for
about
12
minutes
for
professor
de
grazia.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
professor
de
grazia.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
the
exhibitor
in
that
circumstance
the
appropriate
party
to
vindicate
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
suggest
that
he
is
not.
i
just
raised
that
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
has
the
most
immediate
interest,
immediate
impact.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
--
do
i
get
from
that
to
his
intimation
that
you
concede
that
there
is
some
suppressible
material
that
there
are
some
movies
that
could
be
suppressed
under
a
federal
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
try
again.
i
thought
you
did
concede
explicitly
that
there
is
some
material
which
could
be
suppressed
that
is
it
could
be
so
bad
whatever
that
means
under
the
standards
that
it's
so
bad
that
it
could
be
lawfully
suppressed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
no.
i'm
not
talking
about
this
case.
is
there
some
kind
of
material
which
could
be
suppressed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
of
course
judge
aldrich
and
his
two
colleagues
were
not
absolutely
sure
about
this,
were
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
(voice
overlap)
probable
unconstitutionality
which
is
i
suppose
when
a
judge
uses
that
term,
he
means
something
like
probable
cause.
this
was
probable
cause
in
reverse.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
just
means
that
he
is
going
to
take
it
to
the
grand
jury
or
issue
an
information
charge,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
your
time
is
up
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
professor
de
grazia.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
general
quinn,
you
have
four
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
dombrowski
complicated
it
a
little.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
it
would
be
in
this
calendar
year.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
general
quinn.
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
byrne
against
karalexis,
mr.
quinn
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
i
ask
you
another
question,
mr.
quinn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
record
in
this
case
show
any
proffer
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
massachusetts
of
evidence
tending
to
show
pandering
by
the
type
of
advertising
used,
advertising
to
help
this
film.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
show
anything
in
the
nature
of
evidence
that
in
fact,
minors
were
not
excluded,
that
there
was
no
good
faith
effort
to
keep
them
from
attending?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
were
going
narrowly
on
this
one
central
issue,
independent
of
it
–
the
pandering
or
access
of
minors.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
quinn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
strauss.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
any
showing
in
the
stanley
case
that
the
possession
had
been
for
or
was
intended
for
commercial
profit,
public
showing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
the
issue
of
public
showing
or
pandering
by
advertising
before
public
showing
were
not
involved
in
the
stanley
case
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
strauss,
going
back
to
this
other
earlier
question,
are
there
some
forms
of
conduct,
which
if
they
occur
in
private
are
completely
innocent
and
protected,
but
if
performed
in
public
are
not
protected?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
my
question
is,
precisely,
precisely
directed
at
that,
now,
perfectly
simple
example
is
that
it's
entirely
proper
and
highly
desirable
to
take
a
shower.
and
you
might
find
yourself
arrested,
if
you
took
shower
in
the
center
of
pennsylvania
avenue,
is
that
not
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
if
you,
on
the
other
hand,
you
cannot
rob
a
bank
either
in
private
or
in
public,
with
impunity
can
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
robbing
of
the
bank
is
subject
to
penal
sanctions,
whether
you
do
it
in
the
utmost
of
privacy
in
the
middle
of
the
night
or
at
high
noon
with
a
number
of
spectators.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
that
makes
quite
a
difference
between
bank
robbery
and
some
of
these
other
things,
doesn’t
it,
the
taking
of
a
shower
on
pennsylvania
avenue
at
high
noon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you're
saying
i
take
it
is,
that
if
the
same
film
that
we’re
dealing
with
here
is
possessed
by
private
persons
in
their
homes
with
no
indications
that
they
had
it
for
commercial
purposes
that
it
would
be
completely
protected
under
stanley?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
if
the
persons
were,
they
can't
reach
the
film
as
long
as
it
remains
in
the
house.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’re
referring
to
the
stanley
opinion
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
strauss.
mr.
lewin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
this
question,
if
i
may,
if
the
conduct,
which
is
the
target
of
the
state
of
massachusetts
in
this
case,
occurred
on
pennsylvania
avenue,
would
you
think
that
the
principles
would
have
the
first
amendment
right
or
would
they
be
subject
to
arrest,
trial,
conviction,
and
punishment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’ll
defer
my
question
to
professor
dershowitz
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
mean
six
years
from
the
last
showing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
only
one
we’re
concerned
about
is
six
years
from
the
last
one,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’d
be
a
fact
question
in
each
case,
wouldn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dershowitz.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
general
motors
wouldn’t
make
that
claim
with
reference
to
the
drop
in
its
stock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
pretty
speculative,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
--
i
have
to
interrupt
you
again,
professor
dershowitz.
let
me
ask
you.
did
you
--
would
you
accept
the
postulates
i
think
advanced
by
the
solicitor
general
on
the
bearbaiting,
the
right
of
the
state
to
prohibit
bearbaiting
contest
for
public
exhibition
or
otherwise.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
mind
coming
back
now
to
the
bearbaiting
that
we
were
talking
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
both
involved
in
the
prohibition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
aren’t
both
factors
involved
in
a
statute
which
prohibits
that
kind
of
conduct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
know,
switch
on
the
reality
through
first,
let’s
stay
on
the
live
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
now
are
you
saying
that
it’s
all
right
to
kill
one
bear
and
five
dogs
in
a
filming
process
but
it
isn’t
alright
to
kill
many
more
of
them
in
the
live
showing,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
since
we
agree
on
that,
suppose
it
developed
in
a
particular
case
that
–
no
use
naming
the
states
but
let’s
say
14
states
had
not
enforced,
not
sought
to
enforce
or
didn’t
have
any
statutes
against
bearbaiting,
and
four-and-a-
half
million
people
had
watched
bearbaiting
or
the
filming
of
bearbaiting,
would
that
have
any
slightest
relevance
in
your
judgment
on
whether
the
showing
of
bearbaiting
in
boston,
massachusetts
could
or
could
not
be
stopped
under
massachusetts
statute
by
prohibiting
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
the
14
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
go
back
to
something
you
said
earlier.
are
you
suggesting
that
it
is
a
universal
rule
that
everybody
is
offended
by
bearbaiting
for
example?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suspect
that
great
many
people
would
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
either
go
to
see
it,
wouldn’t
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’re
not
suggesting
either
that
everyone,
100%
would
be
offended
by
public
showering
on
pennsylvania
avenue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
the
fact
that
some
--
that
there
is
a
differing
view
on
these
matters
doesn’t
really
enter
into
it,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
you’ve
introduced
at
least
an
element
that’s
new
to
me.
suppose
the
prosecution
could
demonstrate
that
half
of
the
people
who
saw
the
movie
performance
were
offended
by
it
and
so
testified.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
i
follow
your
thesis
on,
how
about
moving
the
bearbaiting
in
to
the
theater
and
charging
$5.00
admission
for
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don’t
want
to
over
work
to
you
on
the
bearbaiting
but
in
order
to
have
the
film
of
bearbaiting,
you
got
to
go
through
an
unlawful
process
in
the
first
instance,
do
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
unlawful?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
bank
robbery
is
illegal
whether
privately
performed
or
any
other
place
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
analogy
is
valid?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
difference
between
the
showering
on
pennsylvania
avenue
and
the
bank
robbery
of
riggs
bank
is
that
the
showering
on
pennsylvania,
you
say,
is
illegal
but
the
showing
of
it
is
legal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
quinn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
attorney
general.
mr.
strauss
you
--
nothing
to
add?
you
have
a
few
more
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
some
margin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
strauss.
the
case
is
submitted.
