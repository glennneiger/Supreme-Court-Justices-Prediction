tell
me.
what
is
the
standing
of
--
there's
already
been
a
conviction
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
this
distribution
mr.
attorney
general.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there
was
something
about
some
delay
in
the
hearing
of
the
appeal
which
is
in
the
supreme
judicial
court,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
an
ordinary
course,
will
there
be
oral
argument
in
that
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
get
to
you.
so
we
won't
get
a
decision
which
goes
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
we
probably
wouldn't
get
that
then
from
your
high
court
until
december
or
january?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
was
after
the
suit
is
filed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
application
to
the
mr.
attorney
general
is
a
nice
significance
in
the
fact
that
this
proceeding
had
been
brought
before
actually
a
criminal
prosecution
was
initiated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
haven't
we
made
the
distinction
in
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
long
after
this
suit
was
brought
--
it
was
the
second
of
that,
i
think.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
accurate
really
to
say
it
was
subsequent
--
as
i
understood
it,
there
had
initially
been
a
prosecution
in
the
indictment
to
some
infirmity
was
superseded
by
another
indictment
after
this
suit
had
been
filed.
is
that
what
the
law
confines?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
that
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
questions
whether
or
not
it
was
a
pending
prosecution
when
this
suit
was
brought
to
the
district
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
difficult
to
argue
that
there
was
none
pending
when
you
--
when
the
suit
was
filed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
only
a
matter
of
days
before
the
second.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
can't
really
a
continuity
of
the
initial
prosecution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i'm
thinking
about.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
the
declaration
of
unconstitutionality.
of
course,
it
was
not
conclusive
upon
the
state
court.
