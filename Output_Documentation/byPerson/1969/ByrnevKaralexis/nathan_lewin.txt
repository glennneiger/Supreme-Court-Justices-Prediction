mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
massachusetts
and
the
solicitor
general
as
amicus
curiae
have,
i
submit,
argued
before
this
court
a
case
that
simply
is
not
here
and
an
issue
that
is
not
fairly
presented
by
the
order
which
is
here
under
review.
i
would
just
like
to
take
a
minute
to
summarize
what
in
fact
has
happened
here.
a
theatre
owner
threatened
with
criminal
prosecution
under
a
state
statute
of
dubious
constitutionality
for
showing
a
film
which
was
found
non-obscene
by
a
federal
court
of
appeals
and
has
been
widely
and
seriously
reviewed,
instituted
a
proceeding
under
42
u.s.c
1983
in
a
federal
district
court
to
prevent
the
threatened
prosecution
and
harassment
by
the
state
prosecutor
under
the
local
obscenity
statute.
the
federal
court
upon
entertaining
that
complaint,
refused
to
intervene
even
with
a
subsequently
instituted
prosecution
under
the
state
statute
and
appellants
here
can
see
that
unlike
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
it's
true.
there
was
a
prior
indictment.
that
earlier
indictment
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
in
the
technical
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
was
a
prosecution
pending
when
this
suit
was
originally
instituted.
at
the
time
the
final
amended
complaint
was
filed,
the
amended
complaint
which
really
presented
the
issues
before
the
court,
there
was
then
no
outstanding
indictment.
that
indictment
had
been
dismissed
because
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
was
a
matter
of
days,
that's
true
mr.
justice
brennan.
but
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
in
terms
of
2283
which
after
all
is
a
technical
statute.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
which
after
all
is
a
technical
statute.
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
construe
that
particularly
in
the
first
amendment
contact
is
to
construe
it
narrowly
but
let
me
go
beyond
that
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
don't
think
that's
essential
and
it's
no
way
essential
in
our
case
because
even
if
one
assumes
that
the
indictment
that
was
entered
subsequent
to
the
firing
of
the
last
amended
complaint
was
one
which
was
entitled
to
protection
under
2283,
the
three-judge
district
court
in
this
case
in
fact
fully
protected
that
prosecution.
it
refused
in
anyway
to
interfere
with
that
state
prosecution.
the
issue
that
was
presented
to
the
district
court
and
which
prompted
the
entry
of
the
order
which
is
here
under
review,
the
interlocutory
order
which
appears
in
pages
44
to
45
of
the
appendix.
the
circumstances
which
prompted
the
entry
of
that
order
were
solely
and
exclusively
the
fact
that
in
the
interim
that
state
prosecution
had
gone
through
a
trial
and
a
judge
had
found
the
appellees
in
this
case
guilty.
the
state
prosecutor
then
returned
to
the
federal
court
and
said
that
whereas
heretofore,
i
have
by
stipulation
permitted
this
film
to
continue
its
exhibition
during
the
pendency
of
that
trial,
i
hereby
withdraw
that
stipulation
and
that
appears
in
the
transcript
which
is
on
file
here
in
this
court
several
times.
it
was
at
that
point
that
the
three-judge
district
court
was
faced
with
the
question
on
which
should
acted
in
this
order
and
that
question
was,
was
it
to
permit
a
state
prosecutor
at
that
juncture
to
threaten
by
threatening
indictments
and
seizures
to
threaten
a
theatre
owner
out
of
permitting
him
to
show
his
film.
now,
i
point
out
to
the
court.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
we
think
this
follows
a
fortiori
from
dombrowski.
we
think
it's
for
--
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
definitely
not
a
2283
issue
and
we
think
it's
not
even
a
dombrowski
issue
for
this
reason
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it's
not
a
dombrowski
issue
because
in
this
case,
the
relief
actually
granted
by
the
district
court
did
not
in
anyway
extend
to
state
prosecutions
and
in
fact
we
submit
if
the
order
is
read
and
we
think
that
this
court
must
judge
the
case
on
the
order
if
the
order
is
read,
it
remove
not
a
single
issue
either
factual
or
legal
from
the
purview
of
the
state
court
in
its
consideration
of
the
state
prosecution.
what
the
order
did
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
indeed
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
judge
was
very
careful
to
talk
about
constitutionality
in
terms
of
probable
constitutionality.
now,
that
makes
absolutely
no
sense
unless
one
considers
the
case
in
the
context
of
this
interim
relief.
as
the
case
was
presented
to
the
three-judge
district
court,
it
was
faced
with
the
question
of
whether
it
should
at
the
point
where
the
state
prosecutor
had
said
“i
will
now
seize
this
film.
i
will
now
indict
again
and
again
if
this
film
is
shown.”
the
three-judge
court
was
faced
with
a
question
whether
having
previously
allowed
the
state
court
proceedings
to
continue
whether
it
should
then
having
indeed
abstained,
we
submit
that
under
the
traditional
view
of
what
abstention
is,
that's
exactly
what
the
district
judge
said
in
this
case.
he
said,
i'll
retain
jurisdiction
over
this
case.
i'll
permit
you
to
make
your
constitutional
claims
in
the
state
court
and
you
can
come
back
to
me
ultimately
after
you've
gone
to
that
state
procedure
but
then
there
was
a
change
of
facts.
suddenly,
there
was
a
conviction
and
the
prosecutor
said,
now,
the
film
has
got
to
stop
and
i
will
indict
and
seize.
at
that
point,
the
three-judge
district
court
said,
“we
have
to
consider
what
the
probable
outcome
of
that
state
case
will
be
because
that
is
relevant
to
a
determination
as
to
whether
this
exhibitor
is
entitle
to
interim
relief
and
it
was
for
that
reason
and
for
that
reason
alone
that
the
three-judge
district
court
then
went
on
to
consider
in
terms
of
probable
outcome,
the
constitutional
issue
which
was
presented
by
the
challenge
of
the
statute
on
his
face.
mr.
nathan
lewin
he
issued
mr.
justice
harlan
a
temporary
injunction
against
proceeding
civilly
or
criminally
or
otherwise
interfering
with
the
exhibition.
now,
i
think
an
important
element
in
understanding
that
injunction
is
the
sentence
which
is
really
the
next
to
last
sentence
of
the
district
judge's
opinion.
he
says
and
i
quote,
“finally,
we
voice
no
opinion
as
to
the
legal
consequences
if
plaintiffs
exhibit
their
film
under
the
protection
of
our
injunction
and
it
is
ultimately
determined
that
our
view
was
mistaken
and
that
such
exhibition
was
properly
considered
elicit.”
what
judge
aldrich
was
saying
in
that
sentence,
i
submit,
was
that
if
these
appellees
who
are
not
entitled
to
be
free
of
the
threat
of
the
job
owning
as
it
were
of
a
local
da
now
go
out
and
continue
to
show
the
film
“i
am
curious
(yellow)”,
they
are
assuming
the
risk
they
were
assuming
all
along,
that
if
at
some
future
date
the
film
was
found
obscene
and
that
--
and
the
statute
is
found
constitutional,
they
may
be
prosecuted
even,
even
for
the
period
of
exhibition
between
the
date
of
the
injunction
and
the
date
of
that
finding.
all
that
the
order
did,
mr.
justice
harlan,
was
tell
the
da,
“you
may
not
threaten
these
prosecutors
with
indictment.
you
may
not
seize
this
film;
you
may
not
interfere
with
its
showing,”
but
nothing
beyond
that.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
does.
in
interest.
with
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right,
but
it
holds
up
the
state
process
in
the
interim
but
does
not
forever
foreclose
a
prosecution,
even
for
that
interim
period.
in
other
words,
ultimately,
they
may
prosecute.
now,
the
question
then
is,
and
we
submit
that's
--
that
--
well,
let
me
first
turn
then
to
the
--
in
that
context
to
the
abstention
point.
the
question
with
respect
to
this
interim
relief,
which
the
three-judge
district
court
granted
is,
was
that
an
appropriate
action
by
a
federal
district
court?
was
that
appropriate
in
terms
of
abstention?
was
it
appropriate
in
terms
of
the
injunctive
relief,
which
is
--
where
the
ground
rule
for
injunctive
relief
set
out
in
this
court's
opinion
in
dombrowski?
we
submit
it
plainly
was.
unlike
all
the
other
cases
which
this
court
has
heard
in
the
last
two
days,
this
is
an
instance
of
ongoing,
continuing
to
this
very
day
suppression
of
speech.
nothing
is
more
plainly
demonstrable
than
the
fact
that
from
the
time
that
the
district
attorney
withdrew
his
stipulation,
this
film
was
not
shown
by
these
appellees
in
boston.
it
is
not
shown
today
only
because
that
stipulation
was
withdrawn.
so
if
we're
talking
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
it's
not
being
shown
because
the
district
attorney
announced
to
the
federal
district
court
on
november
12,
1969
that
if
that
film
reopened,
he
would
seize
it
and
he
would
prosecute,
although
he
had
--
it
had
been
one
prosecution
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
because
it
would
just
subject
out
my
clients
to
continuing
harassment
of
seizures
and
prosecutions.
if
we
would
open
the
film,
it
would
immediately
be
seized
by
police
officers,
there
could
be
an
indictment
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
federal
intervention
is
justified,
mr.
justice
white,
when
the
state
prosecution
--
the
threat
of
state
prosecution
is
being
used
to
close
down
a
film
which
--
whose
obscenity
is
then
being
litigated
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
exactly
what
we
say.
we
say
that
a
federal
district
court
could
enjoin
--
what
we
say,
there
are
--
there
are
a
host
of
reasons
supporting
this
injunction.
the
district
court
chose
one
reason,
which
is
that
if
viewed,
this
statute
has
probably
unconstitutional
understanding.there
are
narrower
grounds
for
sustaining
that
order,
mr.
justice
white,
than
what
the
district
court
did.
we
urge
the
court
to
affirm
on
the
district
court's
reasoning,
but
there
are
narrower
grounds.
we've
set
out
at
pages
54
to
62
of
our
brief
our
argument
that
in
fact,
a
state
prosecutor
may
not
constitutionally
job-own
a
film
to
--
by
that,
i
mean
threatened
prosecution
and
multiple
prosecutions
of
a
film
in
order
to
--
to
have
it
closed
when
in
fact
that
very
film
is
being
litigated,
its
obscenity
is
being
litigated
in
a
state
court,
is
then
under
litigation,
and
there
are
constitutional
challenges
to
the
statute
under
which
it's
being
litigated
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
no.
we
are
taking
the
risk.
our
clients
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right
now,
we
are
not.
we
have
taken
the
risk
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
let
me
explain
that,
because
the
repeated
prosecutions
repeated
multiple
prosecutions
are
more
of
a
risk
we
think
than
we
are
required
to
take.
mr.
nathan
lewin
only
under
the
arrest,
it's
our
decision
as
to
any
decision
under
the
arrest
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
lewin
because
if
the
prosecutor
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
--
if
the
prosecutor
is
by
indict
--
we
--
we
don't
deny
the
prosecutor's
right
to
indict
and
to
prosecute
after
he
has
a
finding
that
a
film
is
obscene,
and
that's
been
concluded.
we're
assuming
that
risk.
the
risk
we
don't
have
to
assume,
mr.
justice
white,
and
i
think
that's
the
risk
that
this
court
talked
about
in
dombrowski,
is
what
i
think
is
very
practically
a
risk
of
a
very
much
different
magnitude,
and
that
is
day
in
and
day
out
seizures
of
films,
repeated
indictments
for
everyday
in
which
you
show
a
film.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
where
state
--
let
me
say
this,
mr.
justice
white,
where
the
state
provides
an
injunctive
remedy
as
it
may,
and
this
court
in
the
kingsley
books
case,
for
example,
set
out
very
specifically
the
rules
for
injunctive
remedies
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
where
the
state
provides
a
board
of
censors,
mr.
justice
white.
of
course,
it
can
do
that.
but
the
state
of
massachusetts
has
not
done
that.
what
the
state
of
massachusetts
has
done
is
it
had
said,
“you
may
proceed
by
way
of
criminal
prosecution.”
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
state
court
couldn't
issue.
it
was
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
--
it
was
a
criminal
prosecution
brought
by
the
state.
there
is
no
way
to
my
knowledge
in
which
in
a
criminal
prosecution
you
can
ask
a
judge
in
a
state
court
to
enjoin
the
prosecutor
from
bringing
other
prosecutions.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
did
not
try
it.
we
will
--
we
are
entitled
to
go
into
a
federal
court,
mr.
justice
white,
under
--
under
the
--
this
court's
decisions
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
the
federal
court
doesn't
have
--
the
state
court
may
be
able
to
do
it
in
an
independent
proceeding,
mr.
justice
harlan,
and
then
you'll
squarely
up
to
the
question
of
whether
we're
obliged
to
institute
a
separate
proceeding
in
a
state
court
where
we
--
where
we
choose
instead
to
go
to
a
federal
court.
in
this
court's
case
in
england
versus
louisiana
state
board
of
medical
examiners,
that
was
specifically
rejected
by
the
court.
if
we
have
a
claim
on
the
year
1983,
if
we're
entitled
to
present
to
a
federal
district
court
our
claim
that
the
prosecutor
is
not
permitted,
either
because
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
or
because
he
is
in
effect
what
--
what
this
prosecutor
has
an
effect
done
is
he
has
implemented
a
system
of
informal
censorship.
there
is
no
judicial
superintendence
of
what
he
does.
there
is
no
review.
indeed,
as
you
pointed
out,
mr.
justice
white,
his
success
is
what
makes
the
whole
thing
non-reviewable.
if
he
--
he
can
go
over
to
any
exhibit
or
motion
picture
films
in
massachusetts
and
say,
“i
will
indict
you
tomorrow
if
you
show
that
film,”
then
of
course
the
exhibitor
would
close
up.
and
if
he
says,
“i'll
indict
you
time
and
again
and
again
and
again
if
you
show
it,”
then
for
a
fortiori,
it
will
close
up.
but
now,
our
client
has
taken
the
risk.
he
is
in
fact
under
a
--
presently
under
an
appeal
sentence
of
one
year
imprisonment
for
showing
this
film.
he's
in
fact
assuming
a
further
risk
under
judge
aldrich's
opinion
that
if
in
fact
this
film
is
found
obscene,
he
can
be
prosecuted
after
the
judgment
of
conviction
is
ultimately
affirmed
and
after
this
court
acts
on
that
film.
he
can
be
prosecuted
from
everyday
that
he
now
shows
that
film.
the
only
relief
we're
seeking
is
interim
relief.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
mr.
justice
white,
that's
not
--
our
position,
is
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
when
its
speech
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
when
it's
continuing
speech,
yes.
that
is
our
position
because
otherwise
if
you
don't
do
that
--
if
you
don't
do
that,
then
in
fact
what
you're
saying
to
a
district
attorney
is
you
may,
without
any
state
statute
--
this
court
has
said
time
and
again
in
the
first
amendment
area,
if
the
state
legislates,
it
must
narrowly
define
the
conduct
to
be
prohibited.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
because
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
because
freedman
and
maryland
provides
the
very
procedural
safeguards
which
we
say
your
absence
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
does
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
true,
it
doesn't
regulate
the
length
of
time,
but
what
it
does
--
what's
happened
in
freedman
and
maryland,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
the
state
of
maryland
has
focused
on
the
question
of
exhibition
of
films
and
it
has
said
that
with
regard
to
the
exhibition
of
films,
we
authorize
this
procedure.
the
state
of
massachusetts
has
never
done
that.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
may
--
it
may
indeed,
but
the
difference
we
think
between
that
case
and
this
is
that
there
at
maryland
has
specifically
focused
on
the
question
of
films
and
has
made
a
determination
as
to
what
are
the
appropriate
procedures
in
the
interim.
that
is
just
not
true
in
massachusetts
if
massachusetts
could
very
easily
enact
an
injunction
statute
as
was
approved
by
this
court
for
example
in
kingsley
books
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
that's
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
is
no
--
your
honor,
the
option
we
had
in
a
state
court
was
simply
to
institute
a
separate
proceeding.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we're
not
required
to
do
that.
if
we
have
a
right
under
1983
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
pardon?
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
your
honor,
with
all
deference,
i
think
the
issue
here
is
--
i
mean
that
issue
was
taken
care
of
by
--
by
the
england
case.
very
specifically
what
the
court
said
in
england
versus
louisiana
state
board,
and
i
refer
to
page
415,
when
a
federal
court
is
properly
appealed
to
in
a
case
over
which
it
has
by
law
of
jurisdiction,
it
is
its
duty
to
take
such
jurisdiction.
the
right
of
party
plaintiff
to
choose
a
federal
court
when
there
is
a
choice
cannot
be
properly
denied.
we're
not
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
pardon?
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
the
--
the
additional
difference,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
there
is
here
no
question
of
state
law,
which
--
which
we
would
want
to
go
to
a
state
court
on.
what
you're
urging
us
to
do
in
terms
of
bringing
a
separate
suit
in
a
state
court
is
to
bring
a
separate
suit
for
the
purpose
of
having
the
state
court
make
the
very
constitutional
determination
that
we're
asking
the
federal
court
to
do.
now,
that
is
specifically
said
in
mcneese
was
impermissible
and
it
was
the
wrong
standard
to
apply.
you
can't
force
a
plaintiff
to
claim
his
federal
constitutional
right
in
the
state
court
when
it's
the
same
right
that
he's
claiming
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
only
in
the
context
of
this
interim
relief.
we
think
that
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
because
i
think
the
claim
that's
being
made,
mr.
justice
white,
with
regard
to
the
state
statute
is
that
the
state
court
may
construe
that
statute
narrowly.
that's
the
ground
for
abstention.
the
ground
for
abstention,
the
only
ground
urged
by
the
appellants
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
but
the
only
ground
urged
by
the
appellants
here
is
that
it's
not
that
--
it's
not
that
the
state
statute
may
be
found
unconstitutional
by
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court.
the
only
ground
is
that
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
may
construe
that
statute
narrowly.
now,
that
is
just
not
true
with
regard
to
this
other
point.
now
we
are
now
--
let
me
make
clear
that
what
we
are
saying
essentially
is
that
this
interim
relief
is
permissible
and
was
appropriately
granted
for,
as
i
say,
a
variety
of
reasons.
the
first
and
second
reason
is
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
that
it's
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
exhibition
of
this
motion
picture
by
these
appellees,
what
we
gone
into
in
some
detail
by
my
colleague,
professor
de
grazia.
but
what
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
is
the
narrower
grounds,
which
are
that
in
the
absence
of
any
state
injunction
statute,
in
the
absence
of
any
state
statute
such
as
that
in
freedman
and
maryland,
in
the
absence
of
any
state
provision
that
says
to
a
state
district
attorney,
“you
may
call
the
termination
of
a
film.”
this
district
attorney
could
not
in
effect
stop
this
film
from
being
shown
by
withdrawing
that
stipulation,
and
that
is
really
all
that
the
order
that
was
issued
by
judge
aldrich
did.
it
simply
said
to
the
state
district
attorney
you
may
not
interfere
with
the
exhibition
of
this
film.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
the
same
would
be
true
if
our
plaintiff
could
show
that
that
repeated
indictment
and
seizure
was
like
the
allegations
in
dombrowski
pursuant
to
a
plan
to
suppress
the
speech.
here,
we
didn't
have
to
show
that
because
here,
there
was
a
stipulation
and
it
was
withdrawn,
and
the
obvious
purpose
of
its
withdrawal
was
to
terminate
the
showing
of
film,
which
it
did.
so
we're
now
in
the
posture
where
the
film
played
from
may
to
november,
no
great
harm
done
to
the
citizens
of
massachusetts.
it
played
from
may
to
november.
the
prosecutor
then
withdrew
his
stipulation,
the
film
showing
immediately
terminated,
the
district
court
entered
its
order,
and
we're
seeking
affirm
it's
just
an
order
to
allow
this
film
to
play.
the
film
is
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
we
think
--
as
i've
tried
to
point
out,
we
think
it's
even
beyond
dombrowski
because
in
dombrowski,
the
district
court
was
being
asked
to
take
an
issue
away
from
the
state
courts,
to
take
away
from
the
state
court
the
issue
of
a
constitutionality
of
that
louisiana
subversive
activities
act.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
--
i
think
really
the
distinction
is
cut
the
other
way
with
all
due
respect,
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
think
in
dombrowski,
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
the
suppression
was
much
--
was
much
less
direct.
what
was
happening
was
they
were
occasional
seizures,
occasional
ransacking
of
the
files.
there
was
a
broad
allegation
that
this
would
drive
away
members
at
some
time
in
the
future
and
would
put
him
out
of
business.
mr.
nathan
lewin
in
this
case,
we
have
the
fact.
we
have
the
very
fact
that
here
is
an
exhibitor
who
wants
to
speak
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
that
makes
no
difference
constitutionally.
in
this
court's
opinions
from
new
york
times
in
sullivan
through
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
true.
mr.
nathan
lewin
your
honor,
the
fact
that
it
hasn't
been
closed
--
if
i
--
if
i,
for
example,
want
to
speak
with
respect
to
a
congressional
action
and
i'm
told
i
could
speak
with
regard
to
the
world
series,
i
was
still
allowed
to
speak
but
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
i'm
probably
--
your
honor,
dombrowski
would
have
been
a
much
stronger
case
if
what
had
happened
in
dombrowski
was
the
state
prosecutors
were
taking
mr.
dombrowski,
just
hypothetically,
and
arresting
him
or
threatening
him
with
arrest
if
he
opened
his
mouth
or
if
he
distributed
the
pamphlets
which
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
in
dombrowksi,
there
were
seizures
and
it
was
claimed
that
the
seizures
were
part
of
a
plan,
but
there
was
not
as
there
is
here,
the
gag
in
the
mouth.
really
in
this
case
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
plain,
your
honor,
from
the
withdrawal
of
the
stipulation
and
the
fact
that
immediately
upon
its
withdrawal
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
that's
a
speech,
your
honor.
that's
the
speech
just
as
surely
as
mr.
dombrowksi's
pamphlet
or
mr.
--
take
mr.
harris'
case,
the
case
your
honors
heard
as
in
the
first
of
this
series.
we
think
that
would
be
parallel
to
this
one
if
on
the
day
after
the
day
for
which
he
was
arrested
for
distributing
a
pamphlet,
harris
said,
“i
want
to
distribute
pamphlet
again
today
and
again
tomorrow
and
the
day
after
and
for
a
whole
month.”
and
the
sheriff
would
come
up
to
him
and
say,
“we'll
arrest
you
every
time.”
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
lewin
he
is
exhibiting
it.
let
--
let
me
just
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right,
and
he
wants
to
exhibit
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
let
--
let
me
just
for
a
minute
add,
your
honor,
because
i
think
we
should
--
i
should
respond
to
claim
that's
been
made
in
the
brief
by
the
state
and
that
was
made
here
on
oral
argument.
it's
true
that
this
film
does
not
belong
to
these
exhibitors.
the
distributor
of
this
film
is
grove
press
which
is
not
a
party
to
this
case.
grove
press
moved
to
intervene
in
the
court
below.
intervention
was
denied
on
the
ground
that
its
interest
would
be
fully
represented
by
the
exhibitor.
we
think
that
entitles
an
exhibitor
that
makes
all
the
claims
that
the
distributor
would
have
made
and
indeed,
we
submit
the
exhibitor
is
no
different
if
harris
had
an
associated.
it's
harris's
rights
to
his
pamphlet
and
he
hands
it
to
an
associate
who
isn't
smart
enough
to
write
it
himself
and
tells
them,
you
distribute
it.
i
don't
think
the
associate
has
less
rights
than
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
because
he
is
not
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
think
that's
true.
i
think
as
it
was
pointed
out
here,
it's
a
fact
which
you
referred
to
that
it's
well
known
that
this
film
has
been
doing
far
better
than
other
films.
i
don't
--
i
admit
that
the
record
doesn't
have
the
fact
on
whether
this
exhibitor
would
have
done
better
with
one
--
with
this
film
than
he
did
with
the
one
he
used
in
place
of
it.
but
i
submit
that
if
an
exhibitor
wants
to
show
film
a
and
he
is
constitutionally
entitled
to
show
it,
it
makes
no
different
that
the
state
says,
“then
you
can
show
film
b
instead.”
if
that
were
right
and
the
state
would
be
controlling
speech.
that's
the
worst
kind
of
regulation.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
he
wants
to
make
this
speech.
this
exhibitor
says,
“i
want
to
show
this
film
and
the
prosecutor
who
is
able
to
achieve
by
various
other
means.
he
is
able
to
achieve
his
lawful
ends,
which
is
to
prosecute
if
in
fact
an
offense
has
been
committed.
and
in
fact
he
has
prosecuted
and
in
fact
all
the
issues
are
going
to
be
considered
in
the
state
case.
that
prosecutor
chooses
instead
to
suppress
the
film
without
statutory
authority,
without
the
benefit
of
any
procedure
that's
been
authorized
by
any
state
court,
suppress
the
film
simply
by
threatening
it
to
death
and
that's
what
this
prosecutor
has
done.
he
has
threatened
this
film
to
death.
he
simply
closed
it
up
by
saying,
“if
you
don't
close
it
up,
i'll
just
prosecute
you
and
i'll
seize
you
and
i'll
prosecute
you
again
and
there
is
no
exhibitor.”
we
submit
that
even
an
exhibitor
who
is
willing
to
run
the
risk
and
our
client
is
willing
to
run
the
risk
of
ultimate
jail
sentence.
he
is
under
a
one
year
jail
term.
even
a
prosecute
--
even
an
exhibitor
who
is
willing
to
run
the
risk
is
not
prepared
to
be
hold
into
court
everyday
to
answer
a
new
indictment
everyday
to
plea,
to
have
his
film
seized,
to
have
to
retain
mirage
of
attorneys
in
order
to
be
able
to
show
a
film
which
an
important
element
which
i
think
i
haven't
mentioned
at
all,
this
is
the
fact
that
this
is
the
film
which
the
court
below
knew
and
which
this
court
can
certainly
take
judicial
notice
of
had
been
found
constitutionally
protected
by
united
states
court
of
appeals.
so
we're
not
dealing
with
just
some
--
whatever
it
may
be
hardcore
pornography.
we're
dealing
with
the
film
which
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
has
said
in
a
suit
court
by
the
united
states
is
subject
to
constitutional
protection.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
think
so
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
maybe
a
fine
reading
of
the
opinion.
and
i
think
(voice
overlap).
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
no.
i
just
mean,
my
proposed
reading
of
it
but
at
the
top
to
page
33,
judge
aldrich
says,
“for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
we'll
assume
that
the
film
is
obscene
by
standards
currently
applied
by
the
massachusetts
court
footnote,
another
court
viewing
the
same
film
is
different,
united
states
versus
“i
am
curious
(yellow).”
i
think
what
judge
aldrich
was
saying
is,
well
alright,
the
massachusetts
court
has,
we
know
(inaudible),
will
assume
arguendo
that
that
would
be
upheld
but
it
is
by
no
means,
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination,
totally
work
was
hardcore
pornography.
it's
a
film
which
maybe
massachusetts
will
find
obscene,
the
second
circuit
has
found
not
obscene.
and
i
think
that's
an
important
element
in
deciding
whether
that
film
should
be
entitled
to
be
shown
in
the
interim
while
these
appellees
are
making
their
way
through
the
massachusetts
courts
and
being
forced
to
assert
in
those
courts
every
right,
every
claim
that
they
might
have.
the
federal
court
has
entertained
in
effect,
no
substantive
claim
either
factual
or
constitutional
other
than
the
claim
essential
to
what
they're
entitled
to
interim.
mr.
nathan
lewin
they're
been
instituted
by
a
complaint
in
addition
to
the
one
in
boston.
i
think
three
others?
three
others
in
all
that
account.
mr.
nathan
lewin
they're
just
waiting
really.
of
course
this
court
has
the
obscenity
vel
non
as
one
of
the
issues
of
this
film
on
its
docket
in
number
905
which
should
be
heard
next
term.
so
i
think
they're
probably
just
awaiting
the
outcome
of
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
they
all
played
one
day
and
let
me
say
again.
what
the
district
court
means
that
each
one
of
those
exhibitors
also
will
be
forced
to
a
criminal
trial
and
we're
not
contesting
that,
we
haven't
appealed
the
abstention
issues
and
all
the
federalism
issues
would
be
presented
in
this
case,
had
we
appealed,
the
district
court's
refusal
to
enjoin
the
ongoing
state
proceeding.
we
did
not
appeal
that.
so
therefore,
the
abstention
should
be
just
on
here.
the
district
court
has
in
fact,
no
matter
what
said
has
in
fact
abstained
and
the
only
issue
that's
here
on
this
appeal
is
what
happens
in
the
interim.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we're
not
exhibiting
the
film.
we
got
a
--
and
with
our
speech
in
a
plainest
sense
is
being
suppressed.
we
are
just
not
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
i
don't
think
it
is,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
no
more
our
choice
than
it
was
the
choice
of
viva
maria
in
interstate
circuit
not
to
exhibit
that
film
or
the
exhibitor
exhibiting
it
because
the
informal
censorship
or
the
interstate
circuit
case
had
found
the
juveniles
should
not
be
allowed
to
see
that
film
and
this
court
struck
down
in
the
interstate
circuit
case.
a
system
under
which
it
noted
self
regulation
would
be
the
result
in
smith
and
california.
it
was
bookseller's
own
individual
choice
not
to
sell
books
if
he
hasn't
read
them
but
that's
not
a
defense.
if
the
state
is
forcing
to
that
choice,
it's
not
a
choice
at
all
and
that's
really
what
the
state
is
doing
with
no
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
because
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
zwickler
and
koota
certainly
established
that
bad
faith
is
not
an
essential
element
in
getting
the
--
in
the
federal
courts
getting
in
to
these
cases.
we
submit
that
here,
there's
an
alternative
reason
which
just
didn't
exist
in
dombrowski
because
in
dombrowski,
again,
the
prospect
of
interference
with
speech
was
off
in
some
future
date.
it's
true
there
were
general
allegations
about
it
and
general
allegations
of
harassment
and
bad
faith.
but
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
here,
you
have
a
very
evil
that
the
court
forth
was
a
prospect
in
dombrowski
because
what
the
court
was
concerned
about
in
dombrowski
was
that
the
conduct
of
the
prosecutor
was
going
to
chill
the
expression
of
first
amendment
rights.
it
was
going
to
prevent
mr.
dombrowski
from
expressing
his
views.
in
this
case,
what
the
prosecutor
has
done
has
in
the
most
demonstrable
way,
achieve
that
result.
it
doesn't
only
have
the
prospect
to
do
it
but
it's
achieved.
moreover,
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
it's
chilled
to
death,
that's
right.
it
just
can't
be
shown.
it's
just
dead.
and
with
motion
pictures,
we
submit
that
the
essence.
if
you
can't
show
a
film
that's
being
nationally
distributed
at
the
time
when
it
is
nationally
reviewed
in
national
magazines,
people
just
won't
be
interested
in
it
anymore.
mr.
nathan
lewin
which
we
think
is
a
permissible
con
--
this
court
it
is
repeatedly
recognized
as
a
permissible
constitutional
consideration.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
what
the
new
york
times
case
was
all
about
and
the
court
said
back
indeed
in
ginsberg.
this
court
went
out
of
its
way
to
specifically
say
that
has
no
part
of
our
decision
in
this
case
the
fact
that
money
is
being
made.
but
i
think
the
distinction
from
dombrowski
is
even
greater
than
that.
i
think
there's
really
a
fallacy
in
trying
to
compare
this
with
dombrowski.
we're
not
in
the
dombrowski
ballpark
because
we're
not
talking
here
that
the
federal
court
invalidating
the
state
statute.
in
dombrowski,
the
plaintiffs
went
in
specifically
to
move
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts
the
question
of
the
federal
constitutionality
of
the
state
statute.
that's
not
in
this
case
at
all.
so
we're
not
really
in
dombrowski
in
that
situation.
we
don't
need
a
dombrowski
exception.
mr.
nathan
lewin
professor
de
grazia
time.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
when
this
case
was
argued
last
term,
among
those
argued
with
it
was
gunn
versus
university
committee,
number
7
last
term.
and
which
the
court
dismissed
the
appeal
on
the
last
day
of
the
term,
when
it
set
this
case
and
its
other
companions
over
for
re-argument.
on
the
ground
that
the
three-judge
district
court
in
gunn
had
failed
to
enter
any
injunctive
order,
whatever.
and
it
was
therefore,
quoting
the
court’s
language,
“not
possible
to
know,
with
any
certainty
what
the
court
has
decided.”
in
this
case,
by
contrast,
the
appealed
order
is
short
and
specific.
and
it
clearly
discloses
what
the
court
below
has
decided.
and
we
submit
that
if
that
injunction
is
analyzed
in
terms
of
what
it
does
not
enjoin,
as
well
as
in
terms
of
what
it
does.
it
emerges
as
a
permissible
and
proper
action,
by
a
federal
district
court,
seeking
to
preserve
for
state
prosecutors
and
courts,
their
proper
role
in
the
enforcement
of
restrictions,
upon
the
distribution
of
obscenity,
while
retaining
the
first
amendment
rights
of
motion
picture
exhibitors
and
distributors
in
the
interim.
to
the
extent,
i
would
submit,
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
goes
beyond
the
terms
of
the
preliminary
injunction
and
expresses
views
concerning
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
ultimate
decision.
it's
nothing
more
than
an
advisory
opinion
or
as
was
suggested
in
some
of
the
cases
argued
before
the
court
yesterday,
in
terms
of
declaratory
judgment,
which
maybe
appealable
by
the
state,
if
it
views
it
is
such
to
the
court
of
appeals.
but,
the
issue
here,
we
submit,
is
framed
by
the
injunction,
which
appears
at
pages
44
and
45
of
this
record.
now,
what
does
it
enjoin?
the
injunction
prohibits
and
enjoins
the
defendants,
the
state
prosecutors,
local
district
attorney
and
the
state
attorney
general’s
office
from
proceedings
civilly
or
criminally
or
otherwise
interfering
with
the
appellee's
exhibition
of
the
film,
“i
am
curious
yellow”
so
long
as
that
exhibition
is
conducted
under
certain
specific
circumstances,
which
cover
the
areas
of
pandering,
and
intrusion.
and
it
provides
in
addition,
that
the
order
is
not
to
prevent
or
inhibit
in
any
way,
the
prosecution
of
a
then
pending
criminal
proceeding
in
the
massachusetts
states
courts,
which
was
then
on
appeal,
from
a
judgment
of
conviction
and
which
the
motion
picture
exhibitors,
who
are
perfectly
legitimate
theater
owners
and
have
shown
award
winning
films
in
the
past
was
sentenced
to
one
year
in
jail
for
having
shown
this
film.
now
let
me,
if
i
may
just
clarify
for
a
moment,
just
to
clarify
the
status
of
that
case,
in
the
massachusetts
state
court
and
supplement
somewhat
on
what
mr.
quinn
has
advised
the
court.
that
case,
those
convictions,
were
appealed
to
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court,
briefs
were
filed.
in
the
state’s
brief,
which
was
response
to
the
appealles
brief
in
the
state
court,
the
state
concluded
with
the
following
language.
since--speaking
of
this
court,
that
court’s
adjudication
in
the
maryland
case,
which
was
argued
here
last
term,
will
bind
the
commonwealth,
it
is
respectfully
suggested
that
this
court,
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court,
hold
its
decision
upon
the
obscenity
of
the
film,
in
abeyance,
pending
that
adjudication,
not
the
adjudication
of
this
case,
but
the
adjudication
of
the
maryland
case,
and
which
the
obscenity
of
the
film
is
an
issue.
pursuant
to
that
suggestion,
these
appellees,
feeling
that
that
issue
would
be
resolved
ultimately
by
this
court,
even
irrespective
of
how
they
would
resolve
by
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
moved
that
the
issue
of
obscenity
and
that
issue
alone
await
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
maryland
case.
but
that
the
other
issues
be
considered
by
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court.
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
acting
on
that
notion
staid
the
entire
argument
of
the
case,
so
the
entire
argument
is
staid
true
in
form
on
our
motion.
but,
really
at
the
suggestion
of
the
state
that
the
maryland
case
would
be
dispositive
of
the
issue
of
obscenity,
which
i
think
is
plain
truth.
if
the
court
were
to
--
there
were
of
course,
other
issues
in
the
maryland
case,
that
assume
that
the
court
were
to
reach
the
issue
of
obscenity
in
the
maryland
case,
and
were
to
decide
that
question
one
way
or
the
other.
of
course,
resolution
of
that
issue,
i
might
say
might
very--if
it
were
resolved
in
favor
of
the
film,
might
very
well
have
the
effective
mooting
out
this
very
case,
as
well.
because
the
sole
issue
here
is
whether
these
exhibitors
may
continue
to
exhibit
this
film
in
the
interim.
now--
mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
i
agree,
they
would
be
subject
to
punishment.
i
think
--
let
me
just
say,
for
purposes
for
our
own
argument
and
with
the
court’s
permission,
the
matters
of
the
issues
discussed
by
the
assistant
to
the
solicitor
general,
the
stanley
issue
and
all
that
--
all
those
ramifications
of
that
issue
were
to
be
covered
in
our
argument,
by
professor
dershowitz,
my
colleague,
who
will
be
arguing
the
second
half
of
the
argument.
now,
we
will
definitely
address
ourselves
to
those
questions,
in
this
portion
of
the
argument,
i
would
limit
my
argument
to
--
as
it
were
the
dombrowski,
the
abstention,
the
federalism
issues--
mr.
nathan
lewin
thank
you
very
much.
i’m
afraid
that
on
the
question
of
the
federalism
and
the
federal
court's
role
in
this
case.
some
confusion
may
have
been
engendered
by
papers,
which
we
filed
at
--
upon
the
application
of
the
state
for
stay
last
term.
when
it
appeared,
i
believe
just
from
those
papers
is
if
in
some
way,
the
federal
district
court
in
this
case,
was
barging
into
a
state
prosecution.
if
anything,
the
record
in
this
case
demonstrate,
we
submit,
that
what
the
district
court
below
did
was
at
successive
stages
of
this
litigation
defer
and
refused
to
act
until
the
juncture
was
reached,
at
which
if
it
failed
to
act,
speech
which
was
eminent,
pending,
and
in
fact,
had
continued
until
the
date
of
its
action,
would
not
merely
be
chilled.
if
i
may
proceed
from
the
court’s
metaphor,
but
would
in
fact
be
put
in
the
deep
freeze,
because
the
consequence
of
the
action,
which
caused
the
federal
district
court
to
issue
the
preliminary
injunction,
which
it
did,
was
the
withdrawal
by
the
prosecutor,
in
the
state
courts,
of
an
agreement
under
which
he
would
permit
the
film
to
continue
to
show
while
the
various
issues
were
being
litigated
through
the
massachusetts
courts.
in
fact,
what
did
the
court
below
do?
its
order
plainly
demonstrates
that
the
court
permitted
the
one
pending
state
prosecution
to
go
on.
in
addition
to
that,
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
and
the
language
of
judge
aldrich,
who
wrote
the
opinion,
which
appears
at
page
37
of
the
record,
concludes
with
an
explicit
caveat
to
these
appellees,
stating
that
the
court
voices
no
opinion,
as
to
the
legal
consequences
if
plaintiffs
exhibit
their
film,
under
the
protection
of
our
injunction,
and
it
is
ultimately
determined
that
our
view
was
mistaken,
and
that
such
exhibition
was
properly
considered
elicit.
in
effect,
what
that
language
in
judge
aldrich
opinion
states
is
that
the
continued
exhibition
of
the
film,
even
under
the
protection
of
the
injunction
is
still
subject
to
the
risk
that
at
the
conclusion
of
whatever
ultimate
decision
is
reached
on
the
various
constitutional
issues,
these
appellees
maybe
prosecuted,
in
fact
retrospectively
for
the
showing
of
the
film,
which
they
engaged
in
during
the
entire
period
of
the
litigation.
so
that
is
if
there
is
anything
that’s
clear
from
the
terms
and
the
order,
it
is
that
in
no
way
forecloses
any
state
court
determination
of
any
relevant
issue
and
in
fact
doesn’t
--
not
only
under
dombrowski
doesn’t
enjoin
any
state
prosecution
but
any
pending
state
prosecution,
but
doesn’t
even
enjoin
future
state
prosecutions.
at
most
it
defers
them
if
they’re
legitimate
to
some
ultimate
date
at
which
if
they
can
properly
be
brought
they
can
then
be
instituted.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no
your
honor,
we
think
it
does
not
enjoin.
mr.
nathan
lewin
what
it
means
is
that
the
prosecutor
may
not
in
the
period
of
time
until
the
issues
are
resolved,
institute
civil
or
criminal
proceedings
or
seize
that
film.
but
the
language
of
judge
aldrich
that
appears
on
page
37—
mr.
nathan
lewin
i’m
referring
to
the
order.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that’s
right,
and
the
order
enjoins
the
institution
of
proceedings.
it
does
not
however
say
that
if
the
film
has
finally
found
obscene,
these
appellees
may
not
then
be
prosecuted
for
having
showing
the
film
in
the
interim.
if
the
case
is
viewed
as
we
think
it
properly
should
be
as
to
what
are
the
appropriate
steps
for
a
federal
district
court
to
take
when
it
has
before
a
case
in
which
there
is
some
doubt
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
under
which
the
state
is
proceeding
where
the
state
has
no
injunction
power.
and
i
think
that’s
important
in
this
context.
the
state
of
massachusetts
has
not
authorized
each
prosecutors
to
go
into
court
and
obtain
injunctions
against
the
showing
of
films.
it
has
an
interim
proceeding
applicable
to
books
but
none
with
respect
to
films.
so
it
authorizes
criminal
prosecution.
now
there
is
a
criminal
prosecution
with
respect
to
a
film
under
a
statute
which
is
a
questionable
constitutionality
with
respect
to
a
film
which
a
federal
district
court
has
found
prior
to
its
opening
to
be
not
obscene.
and
judge
aldrich
took
notice
of
that
too
and
that
appears
in
his
opinion.
and
the
film
is
shown
under
very
careful
safeguards
to
avoid
pandering,
any
showing
to
minors,
any
intrusion
on
the
public.
in
those
circumstances,
the
federal
district
court
says
in
the
interim
until
the
issues
are
resolved
we
think
you
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
show
that
film
subject
possibly
to
future
prosecution
for
you
having
shown
it,
but
you
will
not
be
hold
into
court
everyday
and
indicted
everyday
and
have
the
film
seized
everyday
because
you
are
showing
it
because
that
would
in
effect
be
a
form
of
censorship.
a
form
of
censorship
by
threat
to
be
sure
but
it
would
be
a
form
of
censorship.
and
we
submit
that
that’s
under
all
doctrines
of
nonintervention
or
abstention
or
whatever
federal
policy
applies
we
think
that’s
appropriate.
the
court
below
stayed
its
hand
until
that
point
where
the
threat
the
prosecutor
to
make
--
to
continue
to
prosecute
and
to
indict
and
seize
the
film
had
the
effect
of
an
effect
of
closing
it
down.
now
let
me—
mr.
nathan
lewin
six
years
so
that
there’s
no
question
that
that
it
would
be
within
the
statute
if
prosecutions
were
subsequently
brought.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
six
years
from
any
criminal
act
which
would
be
the
showing
--
any
showing
if
they
are
to
be
prosecuted—
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
that
should
be
true
mr.
chief
justice,
but
there
is
one
there
is
already
a
prosecution.
the
problem
that
this
case
presents
is
that
a
showing
of
the
film
can
be
subject
to
multiple
prosecutions.
these
appellees
have
assumed
the
risk
of
a
single
prosecution
and
indeed
they
are
prepared
to
assume
even
the
risk
of
multiple
prosecutions
if
they’re
proved
wrong.
the
only
thing
that
they
seek
and
that
they
obtain
from
--
they
sought
more
but
the
only
thing
that
they
obtained
from
the
district
court
was
an
order
which
prevented
multiple
prosecutions
while
the
film
was
being
shown,
while
the
litigation
was
going
on,
and
while
their
rights
were
still
an
issue.
at
that
period
of
time,
we
submit
they’re
entitled
to
federal
relief
to
permit
the
film
to
show
in
the
interim
until
that
date
when
it
is
finally
decided
whether
they’re
right
or
wrong.
mr.
nathan
lewin
to
that
extent
we
agree
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
it’s
because
it’s
an
interference
with
a
state
criminal
process
to
obtain
rights
which
could
not
be
obtained
in
the
state
criminal
process
mr.
justice
harlan.
in
other
words,
assuming
even
assuming
that
the
law
were
which
i
think
this
court’s
cases
have
conclusively
established
otherwise,
but
even
assuming
the
law
were
that
one
had
to
exhaust
state
remedies,
as
it
were
to
obtain
relief
from
a
federal
district
court
in
a
free
speech
case,
in
these
circumstances,
there
is
no
way
that
these
appellees
could
say
and
in
fact
obtain
the
right
to
show
the
film
while
its
obscenity
was
being
--
the
matter
of
its
obscenity
was
being
litigated.
they
couldn’t
obtain
that
in
a
defense
to
a
state
criminal
prosecution.
there’s
just
no
way
they
could.
they
can
defend
the
state
criminal
prosecution,
they
can
say
we’re
not
guilty,
put
the
state
to
the
test
of
proving
the
obscenity
of
the
film.
but
when
they
want
to
show
the
film
on
november
12,
1969
and
thereafter,
the
only
remedy
they
have
is
to
go
into
a
federal
district
court
at
that
point
and
say,
“we
institute
this
action
and
seek
this
relief.
we
have
a
right
to
show
the
film
on
november
13th
and
14th
and
15th
while
it’s
obscenity
is
being
tested
under
the
state
criminal
process.”
now,
that
we
submit
is
a
permissible
interference.
what
the
cases
prior
to
dumbrowski
and
what
the
general
principle
of
nonintervention
of
federal
courts
and
state
criminal
process
involves
we
submit,
are
only
those
instances
where
the
same
relief
or
the
relief
that
the
plaintiffs
are
seeking
could
be
obtained
from
the
state
process.
here,
that’s
just
not
possible.
these
appellees,
so
far
as
trying
to
show
the
film
in
the
interim
could
not
obtain
any
relief
from
the
state
courts.
they
could
defend
the
criminal
prosecution.
if
the
state
had
had
an
injunctive
procedure
under
which
the
state
prosecutor
could
go
into
state
court
and
seek
an
injunction
then
they
would
have
that
remedy
in
a
state
court.
they
could
defend
against
bad
injunctive
proceeding.
of
course,
if
the
state
prosecutor
decided
not
to
institute
it,
they
would
never
have
it.
but
assuming
it
did
--
they
could
defend
and
litigate
the
right
of
showing
the
film
in
the
interim,
there
is
no
such
procedure.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
has
a
declaratory
judgment
procedure
mr.
justice
stewart.
however,
the
standards
that
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
applies
in
the
declaratory
judgment
cases
indicate
that
this
issue
could
not
be
raised.
we
have
this
pending,
i
think
on
this
court’s
docket
now
is
the
case
involving
the
obscenity
of
the
stage
play
hare
—
the
pbic
versus
byrne,
which
involved
an
attempt
to
obtain
a
declaratory
judgment
from
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
which
was
subject
to
various
state
objections
that
the
state
raised
in
that
case.
and
that
case
demonstrates
how
hard
it
would
be
even
to
obtain
a
declaratory
judgment
on
the
initial
question,
which
is
the
obscenity
of
the
film.
but
certainly,
in
terms
of
the
right
to
show
it
in
the
interim,
which
is
really
what
we
say
is
at
stake
here
and
all
that
is
involved
in
this
injunction
that
right
could
not
be
asserted
in
the
state
court.
and
it
certainly
could
not
be
asserted
in
a
defense
to
a
criminal
prosecution
because
the
only
issue
in
the
criminal
prosecution
would
be
whether
the
film
is
obscene,
whether
all
the
other
constitution
and
statutory
standards
are
met
and
the
judgment
of
conviction
and
not
whether
the
film
would
be
shown
of
the
13th
or
any
other
days.
on
this
general
principle
of
nonintervention,
if
i
may
just
address
myself
to
it
briefly,
this
court’s
decisions
ranging
way
back
and
certainly
commentating
in
zwickler
and
khuta
have
made
it
clear.
i
think
zwickler
and
khuta,
the
court
quoted
from
a
district
court
opinion
which
made
it,
and
i
just
quote
that
briefly.
the
court
said,
“we
yet
like
to
believe
that
wherever
the
federal
court
sit,
human
rights
under
the
federal
constitution
are
always
a
proper
subject
for
adjudication,
and
that
we
have
not
the
right
to
decline
the
exercise
of
that
jurisdiction
simply
because
the
rights
asserted
and
they
be
adjudicated
in
some
other
form.”
now
here,
in
this
case
we
submit
follows
a
fortiori
from
zwickler
and
dombrowski
and
all
the
others
because
the
right
that’s
covered
by
this
preliminary
injunction
and
let
me
emphasize
it
is
a
preliminary
injunction
and
therefore
the
standards
that
ordinarily
apply
to
preliminary
injunction,
we
submit
should
be
applied.
in
other
words,
district
courts
have
broad
discretion
to
decide
on
the
probabilities
of
success
of
the
ultimate
outcome
of
the
litigation
and
issue
preliminary
injunctions
in
those
terms.
here
we
deal
with
a
preliminary
injunction
and
we
submit
for
that
reason
certainly,
rights
which
couldn’t
be
asserted
in
a
state
court,
which
these
appellees
had
no
way
of
asserting
in
a
state
court
should
properly
or
properly
protected
by
the
federal
district
court
and
should
be
affirmed
here.
now
i
would
like
--
if
i
may
just
briefly
to
go
to
the
question
of
the
effect
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
which
was
raised
also
in
the
argument
last
week
before
this
court,
and
which
we
think
applies
to
these
circumstances
as
well.
one
has
here
a
set
of
facts
in
which
what
the
state
prosecutors
have
sought
to
do
was
prevent
the
exhibition
of
a
film
under
a
statute
which
the
court
below
found
and
we
submit
properly
a
subject
to
constitutional
challenge.
when
that
film
itself
had
prior
to
its
opening
been
found
to
be
constitutionally
protected
by
united
states
court
of
appeals.
now,
we
don’t
argue
and
of
course
we
couldn’t
argue
that
defining
of
united
states
court
of
appeals
is
binding
on
the
state
of
massachusetts
as
a
matter
of
res
judicata.
what
we
do
argue
and
we
elaborate
then
the
distributor
who’s
the
appellant
in
the
maryland
case
elaborates
at
some
length
and
our
brief
in
that
case
and
we
think
it
applies
here
as
well,
is
that
there
--
in
terms
of
protecting
and
giving
wide
scope
to
free
expression
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
and
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
indeed
any
decision
which
is
binding
on
the
united
states,
should
as
a
matter
of
first
amendment
law
be
applied
by
this
court
to
bar
other
proceedings
to
prevent
the
exhibitions
of
the
very
same
material.
now
that’s
just
a
very
--
in
terms
of
the
practical
consequence
on
distributors
and
exhibitors
of
films
and
books
that’s
just
a
very
important
rule.
this
court
has
on
its
docket
right
now
pending
in
one
form
or
another
five
cases
involving
the
exhibition
of
this
film,
five
cases
out
of
the
states
of
alabama,
florida,
massachusetts,
maryland
and
ohio
all
involving
the
exhibition
of
this
film.
as
was
stated
in
the
brief
in
the
maryland
case
there
were
144
lawsuits
in
the
country
involving
the
exhibitions
of
this
film
essentially
in
the
distribution
of
films
and
books
throughout
the
united
states
to
put
a
distributor
or
an
exhibitor
who
has
established
to
the
satisfaction
of
a
court
of
appeals
and
a
judgment
binding
on
the
united
states
which
could
have
enjoined
by
states
throughout
the
united
states.
that
a
film
or
a
book
is
constitutionally
protected
must
we
submit
act
to
prevent
future
harassment,
multiplicities
of
litigation
which
otherwise
makes
the
distribution
of
such
first
amendment
material
or
arguable
first
amendment
material
close
to
impossible.
and
that’s
why
the
argument
made
is
essentially
that
that
judgment
although
not
operative
as
a
matter
of
res
judicata
should
like
various
other
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
found
judgments
binding
on
the
united
states
in
the
search
and
seizure
area,
in
the
self-incrimination
area
to
be
in
effect
have
operative
affect
on
state
prosecutors
and
state
bodies
that
that
very
same
rule
should
be
applied
in
the
field
of
arguable
obscenity
in
the
filed
of
books
or
movies
that
are
distributed
nationwide
that
go
through
a
federal
proceeding
that
are
conclusively
adjudicated
by
a
federal
court
as
being
constitutionally
protected
and
should
be—we
submit
free
of
multiplicities
and
repeated
suits
in
various
local
jurisdiction.
mr.
nathan
lewin
a
license
in
the
sense
that
it
gave
us
a
first
amendment
shield.
we
think
that
if
--
this
is
a
one
need
to
parade
horribles.
the
history
of
this
case—
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
right,
the
history
of
this
case
shows
and
this
movie
shows
what
the
contrary
result
--
or
what
the
absence
of
such
a
rule
really
results
in,
which
is—
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
rationale
is
that
if
vis-a-vis,
the
united
states
material
is
found
to
be
constitutionally
protected
under
the
first
amendment,
states
which
have
had
an
opportunity
to
enter
that
litigation
assuming
it’s
a
judgment,
which
have
had
an
opportunity
to
enter
that
litigation
should
not
thereafter,
as
a
matter
of
first
amendment
law
be
able
to
inhibit
its
distribution,
sale
and
publication
by
under
local
ordinances.
mr.
nathan
lewin
because
if
the
right
to
free
speech,
the
first
amendment
right,
is
to
be
given
the
breathing
space
it
needs
which
this
court
has
referred
to
in
various
occasions,
the
danger
to
it
of
threats
of
multiplicities
litigation
must
be
prevented.
in
other
words,
it’s
simply
as
it
were
a
preventive
rule,
a
prophylactic
rule
that
we
submit
the
court
should
adopt
to
prevent
the
very
kind
of
situation
which
is
a
reason
with
regards
to
this
film.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think—
mr.
nathan
lewin
it’s
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
prefer
to
call
it
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i’d
prefer
to
call
it
a
federal
shield,
but
i
think
that’s
essentially
what
it
is
that’s
right,
but
only
in
a
litigation.
let
me
say
federal
license,
which
can’t
just
be
granted
unilaterally
but
only
in
litigation
where
the
state
has
the
opportunity
to
come
in.
that’s
really
our
argument
we
think
of
the
state
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
if
it
said
the
film
was
obscene
it
wouldn’t
be
here
mr.
justice
harlan,
it’d
be
out
of
the
country
and
we
couldn’t
have
brought
it
in.
of
course
we
would
have
taken
it
up
to
this
court
but
it
just
wouldn’t
be
here.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
that
could
be
contested.
i
think
if
a
state
were
to
say
they’ve
added
things
to
the
movie,
i
think
that’s
an
appropriate
issue
that
a
state
may
consider.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
would
be
if—but
i
think
in
this
case
i
must
say
its
totally
undisputed
that
the
very
same
versions
of
the
film
were
being
shown
all
over
the
country.
but—
mr.
nathan
lewin
it’s
true,
that’s
true
but
it’s
awfully
cold
in
maryland,
massachusetts,
alabama,
florida
and
ohio.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
problem
with
that
mr.
justice
marshall
of
course
is
that
you’re
imposing
an
added
burden
to
obtain
material
which
is
subject
to
constitutional
protection.
we
think
that’s
not
proper.
you
can’t
just
say
“well,
since
if
we
allow
it
in
various
regions
of
the
country
where
people
can
reach
it
by
traveling
that’s
good
enough.”
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think,
well
in
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
is
what
we’re
saying.
we
don’t
have
an
obligation
to
litigate
if
we
litigate
against
the
united
states
in
a
case
where
--
in
a
federal
court
where
the
states
and
local
jurisdictions
could
come
in
if
they
wanted.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh!
yes.
if
it
wanted
to
claim
that
the
film
should
not
be
shown
in
hawaii,
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
where
the
burden
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
difference
is
that
the
state
of
hawaii
has
no
constitutional
right
not
to
be
in
a
new
york
federal
district
court.
what
we
maintain,
and
i
think
what
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
dombrowski
and
prior
to
would
have
said
is
that
what
the
first
amendment
requires,
in
terms
of
breathing
space
is
prevent
where
necessary
even
unnecessary
multiplicities
repeated
litigation.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
what
the
dombrowski
could
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
what
the
dombrowski
opinion
does
say
is
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
no
i
don’t
--
but
what
the
dombrowski
opinion
does
say
is
that
the
threat
of
sanctions
and
that
--
by
imposing
on
a
party
who’s
exercising
a
first
amendment
right,
the
obligation
to
go
through
repeated
litigation
that
in
itself
will
deter
speech.
and
i
think,
your
honor,
adverted
exactly
to
that
in
the
interstate
circuit
case.
there
is
language
in
the
interstate
circuit
case
which
talks
about
the
fact
that
the
ordinance
of
the
city
of
dallas,
if
other
cities
do
the
same
thing,
will
have
an
inhibiting
effect
on
the
motion
picture
industry
in
hollywood.
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
the
licensing
statute
in
that
case
was
struck
down
and
your
honor
referred
to
the
fact
that
if
dallas
could
do
what
it
does,
then
every
other
city
could
do
what
it
wanted
to
do
and
the
result
would
be
that
those
who
produced
films
would
not
produce
anything
that’s
even
close
to
the
line.
that’s
exactly
what
we’re
talking
about
here.
if
this
film
can
be
subjected
to
a
144
lawsuits
and
five
trips
to
this
court,
then
people
are
obviously
deterred
from
producing
any
films
which
maybe
subject
to
litigation.
mr.
nathan
lewin
in
terms
of
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
you
mean
motion
pictures
that
are
close
to
the
line
if
that
--
i
think
the
real
test
is
whether
the
effect
of
litigation
is
inhibiting
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
i
think
your
honor
with
all
respect
i
think
it
has
been
chilled
with
regard
to
legitimate
distributors
and
exhibits.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
can
only
say
that
the
distributor
of
this
film
has
incurred
very
very
substantial
cost
in
litigating
these
issues
through
the
various
courts
and
that
in
fact
it
is
bound
to
be
an
inhibitory
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don’t
think
so,
but
i
just
an
alternative
ground
that
i
think
we
have
relied
on
in
the
brief
and
that
i
just
wanted
to
discuss
somewhat
on
not
a
lot.
mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
massachusetts
and
the
solicitor
general
as
amicus
curiae
have,
i
submit,
argued
before
this
court
a
case
that
simply
is
not
here
and
an
issue
that
is
not
fairly
presented
by
the
order
which
is
here
under
review.
i
would
just
like
to
take
a
minute
to
summarize
what
in
fact
has
happened
here.
a
theatre
owner
threatened
with
criminal
prosecution
under
a
state
statute
of
dubious
constitutionality
for
showing
a
film
which
was
found
non-obscene
by
a
federal
court
of
appeals
and
has
been
widely
and
seriously
reviewed,
instituted
a
proceeding
under
42
u.s.c
1983
in
a
federal
district
court
to
prevent
the
threatened
prosecution
and
harassment
by
the
state
prosecutor
under
the
local
obscenity
statute.
the
federal
court
upon
entertaining
that
complaint,
refused
to
intervene
even
with
a
subsequently
instituted
prosecution
under
the
state
statute
and
appellants
here
can
see
that
unlike
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
it's
true.
there
was
a
prior
indictment.
that
earlier
indictment
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
in
the
technical
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
was
a
prosecution
pending
when
this
suit
was
originally
instituted.
at
the
time
the
final
amended
complaint
was
filed,
the
amended
complaint
which
really
presented
the
issues
before
the
court,
there
was
then
no
outstanding
indictment.
that
indictment
had
been
dismissed
because
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
was
a
matter
of
days,
that's
true
mr.
justice
brennan.
but
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
in
terms
of
2283
which
after
all
is
a
technical
statute.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
which
after
all
is
a
technical
statute.
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
construe
that
particularly
in
the
first
amendment
contact
is
to
construe
it
narrowly
but
let
me
go
beyond
that
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
don't
think
that's
essential
and
it's
no
way
essential
in
our
case
because
even
if
one
assumes
that
the
indictment
that
was
entered
subsequent
to
the
firing
of
the
last
amended
complaint
was
one
which
was
entitled
to
protection
under
2283,
the
three-judge
district
court
in
this
case
in
fact
fully
protected
that
prosecution.
it
refused
in
anyway
to
interfere
with
that
state
prosecution.
the
issue
that
was
presented
to
the
district
court
and
which
prompted
the
entry
of
the
order
which
is
here
under
review,
the
interlocutory
order
which
appears
in
pages
44
to
45
of
the
appendix.
the
circumstances
which
prompted
the
entry
of
that
order
were
solely
and
exclusively
the
fact
that
in
the
interim
that
state
prosecution
had
gone
through
a
trial
and
a
judge
had
found
the
appellees
in
this
case
guilty.
the
state
prosecutor
then
returned
to
the
federal
court
and
said
that
whereas
heretofore,
i
have
by
stipulation
permitted
this
film
to
continue
its
exhibition
during
the
pendency
of
that
trial,
i
hereby
withdraw
that
stipulation
and
that
appears
in
the
transcript
which
is
on
file
here
in
this
court
several
times.
it
was
at
that
point
that
the
three-judge
district
court
was
faced
with
the
question
on
which
should
acted
in
this
order
and
that
question
was,
was
it
to
permit
a
state
prosecutor
at
that
juncture
to
threaten
by
threatening
indictments
and
seizures
to
threaten
a
theatre
owner
out
of
permitting
him
to
show
his
film.
now,
i
point
out
to
the
court.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
we
think
this
follows
a
fortiori
from
dombrowski.
we
think
it's
for
--
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
definitely
not
a
2283
issue
and
we
think
it's
not
even
a
dombrowski
issue
for
this
reason
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it's
not
a
dombrowski
issue
because
in
this
case,
the
relief
actually
granted
by
the
district
court
did
not
in
anyway
extend
to
state
prosecutions
and
in
fact
we
submit
if
the
order
is
read
and
we
think
that
this
court
must
judge
the
case
on
the
order
if
the
order
is
read,
it
remove
not
a
single
issue
either
factual
or
legal
from
the
purview
of
the
state
court
in
its
consideration
of
the
state
prosecution.
what
the
order
did
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
indeed
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
judge
was
very
careful
to
talk
about
constitutionality
in
terms
of
probable
constitutionality.
now,
that
makes
absolutely
no
sense
unless
one
considers
the
case
in
the
context
of
this
interim
relief.
as
the
case
was
presented
to
the
three-judge
district
court,
it
was
faced
with
the
question
of
whether
it
should
at
the
point
where
the
state
prosecutor
had
said
“i
will
now
seize
this
film.
i
will
now
indict
again
and
again
if
this
film
is
shown.”
the
three-judge
court
was
faced
with
a
question
whether
having
previously
allowed
the
state
court
proceedings
to
continue
whether
it
should
then
having
indeed
abstained,
we
submit
that
under
the
traditional
view
of
what
abstention
is,
that's
exactly
what
the
district
judge
said
in
this
case.
he
said,
i'll
retain
jurisdiction
over
this
case.
i'll
permit
you
to
make
your
constitutional
claims
in
the
state
court
and
you
can
come
back
to
me
ultimately
after
you've
gone
to
that
state
procedure
but
then
there
was
a
change
of
facts.
suddenly,
there
was
a
conviction
and
the
prosecutor
said,
now,
the
film
has
got
to
stop
and
i
will
indict
and
seize.
at
that
point,
the
three-judge
district
court
said,
“we
have
to
consider
what
the
probable
outcome
of
that
state
case
will
be
because
that
is
relevant
to
a
determination
as
to
whether
this
exhibitor
is
entitle
to
interim
relief
and
it
was
for
that
reason
and
for
that
reason
alone
that
the
three-judge
district
court
then
went
on
to
consider
in
terms
of
probable
outcome,
the
constitutional
issue
which
was
presented
by
the
challenge
of
the
statute
on
his
face.
mr.
nathan
lewin
he
issued
mr.
justice
harlan
a
temporary
injunction
against
proceeding
civilly
or
criminally
or
otherwise
interfering
with
the
exhibition.
now,
i
think
an
important
element
in
understanding
that
injunction
is
the
sentence
which
is
really
the
next
to
last
sentence
of
the
district
judge's
opinion.
he
says
and
i
quote,
“finally,
we
voice
no
opinion
as
to
the
legal
consequences
if
plaintiffs
exhibit
their
film
under
the
protection
of
our
injunction
and
it
is
ultimately
determined
that
our
view
was
mistaken
and
that
such
exhibition
was
properly
considered
elicit.”
what
judge
aldrich
was
saying
in
that
sentence,
i
submit,
was
that
if
these
appellees
who
are
not
entitled
to
be
free
of
the
threat
of
the
job
owning
as
it
were
of
a
local
da
now
go
out
and
continue
to
show
the
film
“i
am
curious
(yellow)”,
they
are
assuming
the
risk
they
were
assuming
all
along,
that
if
at
some
future
date
the
film
was
found
obscene
and
that
--
and
the
statute
is
found
constitutional,
they
may
be
prosecuted
even,
even
for
the
period
of
exhibition
between
the
date
of
the
injunction
and
the
date
of
that
finding.
all
that
the
order
did,
mr.
justice
harlan,
was
tell
the
da,
“you
may
not
threaten
these
prosecutors
with
indictment.
you
may
not
seize
this
film;
you
may
not
interfere
with
its
showing,”
but
nothing
beyond
that.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
does.
in
interest.
with
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right,
but
it
holds
up
the
state
process
in
the
interim
but
does
not
forever
foreclose
a
prosecution,
even
for
that
interim
period.
in
other
words,
ultimately,
they
may
prosecute.
now,
the
question
then
is,
and
we
submit
that's
--
that
--
well,
let
me
first
turn
then
to
the
--
in
that
context
to
the
abstention
point.
the
question
with
respect
to
this
interim
relief,
which
the
three-judge
district
court
granted
is,
was
that
an
appropriate
action
by
a
federal
district
court?
was
that
appropriate
in
terms
of
abstention?
was
it
appropriate
in
terms
of
the
injunctive
relief,
which
is
--
where
the
ground
rule
for
injunctive
relief
set
out
in
this
court's
opinion
in
dombrowski?
we
submit
it
plainly
was.
unlike
all
the
other
cases
which
this
court
has
heard
in
the
last
two
days,
this
is
an
instance
of
ongoing,
continuing
to
this
very
day
suppression
of
speech.
nothing
is
more
plainly
demonstrable
than
the
fact
that
from
the
time
that
the
district
attorney
withdrew
his
stipulation,
this
film
was
not
shown
by
these
appellees
in
boston.
it
is
not
shown
today
only
because
that
stipulation
was
withdrawn.
so
if
we're
talking
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
it's
not
being
shown
because
the
district
attorney
announced
to
the
federal
district
court
on
november
12,
1969
that
if
that
film
reopened,
he
would
seize
it
and
he
would
prosecute,
although
he
had
--
it
had
been
one
prosecution
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
because
it
would
just
subject
out
my
clients
to
continuing
harassment
of
seizures
and
prosecutions.
if
we
would
open
the
film,
it
would
immediately
be
seized
by
police
officers,
there
could
be
an
indictment
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
federal
intervention
is
justified,
mr.
justice
white,
when
the
state
prosecution
--
the
threat
of
state
prosecution
is
being
used
to
close
down
a
film
which
--
whose
obscenity
is
then
being
litigated
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
exactly
what
we
say.
we
say
that
a
federal
district
court
could
enjoin
--
what
we
say,
there
are
--
there
are
a
host
of
reasons
supporting
this
injunction.
the
district
court
chose
one
reason,
which
is
that
if
viewed,
this
statute
has
probably
unconstitutional
understanding.there
are
narrower
grounds
for
sustaining
that
order,
mr.
justice
white,
than
what
the
district
court
did.
we
urge
the
court
to
affirm
on
the
district
court's
reasoning,
but
there
are
narrower
grounds.
we've
set
out
at
pages
54
to
62
of
our
brief
our
argument
that
in
fact,
a
state
prosecutor
may
not
constitutionally
job-own
a
film
to
--
by
that,
i
mean
threatened
prosecution
and
multiple
prosecutions
of
a
film
in
order
to
--
to
have
it
closed
when
in
fact
that
very
film
is
being
litigated,
its
obscenity
is
being
litigated
in
a
state
court,
is
then
under
litigation,
and
there
are
constitutional
challenges
to
the
statute
under
which
it's
being
litigated
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
no.
we
are
taking
the
risk.
our
clients
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right
now,
we
are
not.
we
have
taken
the
risk
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
let
me
explain
that,
because
the
repeated
prosecutions
repeated
multiple
prosecutions
are
more
of
a
risk
we
think
than
we
are
required
to
take.
mr.
nathan
lewin
only
under
the
arrest,
it's
our
decision
as
to
any
decision
under
the
arrest
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
lewin
because
if
the
prosecutor
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
--
if
the
prosecutor
is
by
indict
--
we
--
we
don't
deny
the
prosecutor's
right
to
indict
and
to
prosecute
after
he
has
a
finding
that
a
film
is
obscene,
and
that's
been
concluded.
we're
assuming
that
risk.
the
risk
we
don't
have
to
assume,
mr.
justice
white,
and
i
think
that's
the
risk
that
this
court
talked
about
in
dombrowski,
is
what
i
think
is
very
practically
a
risk
of
a
very
much
different
magnitude,
and
that
is
day
in
and
day
out
seizures
of
films,
repeated
indictments
for
everyday
in
which
you
show
a
film.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
where
state
--
let
me
say
this,
mr.
justice
white,
where
the
state
provides
an
injunctive
remedy
as
it
may,
and
this
court
in
the
kingsley
books
case,
for
example,
set
out
very
specifically
the
rules
for
injunctive
remedies
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
where
the
state
provides
a
board
of
censors,
mr.
justice
white.
of
course,
it
can
do
that.
but
the
state
of
massachusetts
has
not
done
that.
what
the
state
of
massachusetts
has
done
is
it
had
said,
“you
may
proceed
by
way
of
criminal
prosecution.”
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
state
court
couldn't
issue.
it
was
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
--
it
was
a
criminal
prosecution
brought
by
the
state.
there
is
no
way
to
my
knowledge
in
which
in
a
criminal
prosecution
you
can
ask
a
judge
in
a
state
court
to
enjoin
the
prosecutor
from
bringing
other
prosecutions.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
did
not
try
it.
we
will
--
we
are
entitled
to
go
into
a
federal
court,
mr.
justice
white,
under
--
under
the
--
this
court's
decisions
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
the
federal
court
doesn't
have
--
the
state
court
may
be
able
to
do
it
in
an
independent
proceeding,
mr.
justice
harlan,
and
then
you'll
squarely
up
to
the
question
of
whether
we're
obliged
to
institute
a
separate
proceeding
in
a
state
court
where
we
--
where
we
choose
instead
to
go
to
a
federal
court.
in
this
court's
case
in
england
versus
louisiana
state
board
of
medical
examiners,
that
was
specifically
rejected
by
the
court.
if
we
have
a
claim
on
the
year
1983,
if
we're
entitled
to
present
to
a
federal
district
court
our
claim
that
the
prosecutor
is
not
permitted,
either
because
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
or
because
he
is
in
effect
what
--
what
this
prosecutor
has
an
effect
done
is
he
has
implemented
a
system
of
informal
censorship.
there
is
no
judicial
superintendence
of
what
he
does.
there
is
no
review.
indeed,
as
you
pointed
out,
mr.
justice
white,
his
success
is
what
makes
the
whole
thing
non-reviewable.
if
he
--
he
can
go
over
to
any
exhibit
or
motion
picture
films
in
massachusetts
and
say,
“i
will
indict
you
tomorrow
if
you
show
that
film,”
then
of
course
the
exhibitor
would
close
up.
and
if
he
says,
“i'll
indict
you
time
and
again
and
again
and
again
if
you
show
it,”
then
for
a
fortiori,
it
will
close
up.
but
now,
our
client
has
taken
the
risk.
he
is
in
fact
under
a
--
presently
under
an
appeal
sentence
of
one
year
imprisonment
for
showing
this
film.
he's
in
fact
assuming
a
further
risk
under
judge
aldrich's
opinion
that
if
in
fact
this
film
is
found
obscene,
he
can
be
prosecuted
after
the
judgment
of
conviction
is
ultimately
affirmed
and
after
this
court
acts
on
that
film.
he
can
be
prosecuted
from
everyday
that
he
now
shows
that
film.
the
only
relief
we're
seeking
is
interim
relief.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
mr.
justice
white,
that's
not
--
our
position,
is
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
when
its
speech
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
when
it's
continuing
speech,
yes.
that
is
our
position
because
otherwise
if
you
don't
do
that
--
if
you
don't
do
that,
then
in
fact
what
you're
saying
to
a
district
attorney
is
you
may,
without
any
state
statute
--
this
court
has
said
time
and
again
in
the
first
amendment
area,
if
the
state
legislates,
it
must
narrowly
define
the
conduct
to
be
prohibited.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
because
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
because
freedman
and
maryland
provides
the
very
procedural
safeguards
which
we
say
your
absence
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
does
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
true,
it
doesn't
regulate
the
length
of
time,
but
what
it
does
--
what's
happened
in
freedman
and
maryland,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
the
state
of
maryland
has
focused
on
the
question
of
exhibition
of
films
and
it
has
said
that
with
regard
to
the
exhibition
of
films,
we
authorize
this
procedure.
the
state
of
massachusetts
has
never
done
that.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
may
--
it
may
indeed,
but
the
difference
we
think
between
that
case
and
this
is
that
there
at
maryland
has
specifically
focused
on
the
question
of
films
and
has
made
a
determination
as
to
what
are
the
appropriate
procedures
in
the
interim.
that
is
just
not
true
in
massachusetts
if
massachusetts
could
very
easily
enact
an
injunction
statute
as
was
approved
by
this
court
for
example
in
kingsley
books
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
that's
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
is
no
--
your
honor,
the
option
we
had
in
a
state
court
was
simply
to
institute
a
separate
proceeding.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we're
not
required
to
do
that.
if
we
have
a
right
under
1983
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
pardon?
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
your
honor,
with
all
deference,
i
think
the
issue
here
is
--
i
mean
that
issue
was
taken
care
of
by
--
by
the
england
case.
very
specifically
what
the
court
said
in
england
versus
louisiana
state
board,
and
i
refer
to
page
415,
when
a
federal
court
is
properly
appealed
to
in
a
case
over
which
it
has
by
law
of
jurisdiction,
it
is
its
duty
to
take
such
jurisdiction.
the
right
of
party
plaintiff
to
choose
a
federal
court
when
there
is
a
choice
cannot
be
properly
denied.
we're
not
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
pardon?
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
the
--
the
additional
difference,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
there
is
here
no
question
of
state
law,
which
--
which
we
would
want
to
go
to
a
state
court
on.
what
you're
urging
us
to
do
in
terms
of
bringing
a
separate
suit
in
a
state
court
is
to
bring
a
separate
suit
for
the
purpose
of
having
the
state
court
make
the
very
constitutional
determination
that
we're
asking
the
federal
court
to
do.
now,
that
is
specifically
said
in
mcneese
was
impermissible
and
it
was
the
wrong
standard
to
apply.
you
can't
force
a
plaintiff
to
claim
his
federal
constitutional
right
in
the
state
court
when
it's
the
same
right
that
he's
claiming
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
only
in
the
context
of
this
interim
relief.
we
think
that
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
because
i
think
the
claim
that's
being
made,
mr.
justice
white,
with
regard
to
the
state
statute
is
that
the
state
court
may
construe
that
statute
narrowly.
that's
the
ground
for
abstention.
the
ground
for
abstention,
the
only
ground
urged
by
the
appellants
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
but
the
only
ground
urged
by
the
appellants
here
is
that
it's
not
that
--
it's
not
that
the
state
statute
may
be
found
unconstitutional
by
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court.
the
only
ground
is
that
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
may
construe
that
statute
narrowly.
now,
that
is
just
not
true
with
regard
to
this
other
point.
now
we
are
now
--
let
me
make
clear
that
what
we
are
saying
essentially
is
that
this
interim
relief
is
permissible
and
was
appropriately
granted
for,
as
i
say,
a
variety
of
reasons.
the
first
and
second
reason
is
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
that
it's
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
exhibition
of
this
motion
picture
by
these
appellees,
what
we
gone
into
in
some
detail
by
my
colleague,
professor
de
grazia.
but
what
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
is
the
narrower
grounds,
which
are
that
in
the
absence
of
any
state
injunction
statute,
in
the
absence
of
any
state
statute
such
as
that
in
freedman
and
maryland,
in
the
absence
of
any
state
provision
that
says
to
a
state
district
attorney,
“you
may
call
the
termination
of
a
film.”
this
district
attorney
could
not
in
effect
stop
this
film
from
being
shown
by
withdrawing
that
stipulation,
and
that
is
really
all
that
the
order
that
was
issued
by
judge
aldrich
did.
it
simply
said
to
the
state
district
attorney
you
may
not
interfere
with
the
exhibition
of
this
film.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
the
same
would
be
true
if
our
plaintiff
could
show
that
that
repeated
indictment
and
seizure
was
like
the
allegations
in
dombrowski
pursuant
to
a
plan
to
suppress
the
speech.
here,
we
didn't
have
to
show
that
because
here,
there
was
a
stipulation
and
it
was
withdrawn,
and
the
obvious
purpose
of
its
withdrawal
was
to
terminate
the
showing
of
film,
which
it
did.
so
we're
now
in
the
posture
where
the
film
played
from
may
to
november,
no
great
harm
done
to
the
citizens
of
massachusetts.
it
played
from
may
to
november.
the
prosecutor
then
withdrew
his
stipulation,
the
film
showing
immediately
terminated,
the
district
court
entered
its
order,
and
we're
seeking
affirm
it's
just
an
order
to
allow
this
film
to
play.
the
film
is
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
we
think
--
as
i've
tried
to
point
out,
we
think
it's
even
beyond
dombrowski
because
in
dombrowski,
the
district
court
was
being
asked
to
take
an
issue
away
from
the
state
courts,
to
take
away
from
the
state
court
the
issue
of
a
constitutionality
of
that
louisiana
subversive
activities
act.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
--
i
think
really
the
distinction
is
cut
the
other
way
with
all
due
respect,
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
think
in
dombrowski,
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
the
suppression
was
much
--
was
much
less
direct.
what
was
happening
was
they
were
occasional
seizures,
occasional
ransacking
of
the
files.
there
was
a
broad
allegation
that
this
would
drive
away
members
at
some
time
in
the
future
and
would
put
him
out
of
business.
mr.
nathan
lewin
in
this
case,
we
have
the
fact.
we
have
the
very
fact
that
here
is
an
exhibitor
who
wants
to
speak
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
that
makes
no
difference
constitutionally.
in
this
court's
opinions
from
new
york
times
in
sullivan
through
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
true.
mr.
nathan
lewin
your
honor,
the
fact
that
it
hasn't
been
closed
--
if
i
--
if
i,
for
example,
want
to
speak
with
respect
to
a
congressional
action
and
i'm
told
i
could
speak
with
regard
to
the
world
series,
i
was
still
allowed
to
speak
but
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
i'm
probably
--
your
honor,
dombrowski
would
have
been
a
much
stronger
case
if
what
had
happened
in
dombrowski
was
the
state
prosecutors
were
taking
mr.
dombrowski,
just
hypothetically,
and
arresting
him
or
threatening
him
with
arrest
if
he
opened
his
mouth
or
if
he
distributed
the
pamphlets
which
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
in
dombrowksi,
there
were
seizures
and
it
was
claimed
that
the
seizures
were
part
of
a
plan,
but
there
was
not
as
there
is
here,
the
gag
in
the
mouth.
really
in
this
case
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
plain,
your
honor,
from
the
withdrawal
of
the
stipulation
and
the
fact
that
immediately
upon
its
withdrawal
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
that's
a
speech,
your
honor.
that's
the
speech
just
as
surely
as
mr.
dombrowksi's
pamphlet
or
mr.
--
take
mr.
harris'
case,
the
case
your
honors
heard
as
in
the
first
of
this
series.
we
think
that
would
be
parallel
to
this
one
if
on
the
day
after
the
day
for
which
he
was
arrested
for
distributing
a
pamphlet,
harris
said,
“i
want
to
distribute
pamphlet
again
today
and
again
tomorrow
and
the
day
after
and
for
a
whole
month.”
and
the
sheriff
would
come
up
to
him
and
say,
“we'll
arrest
you
every
time.”
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
lewin
he
is
exhibiting
it.
let
--
let
me
just
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right,
and
he
wants
to
exhibit
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
let
--
let
me
just
for
a
minute
add,
your
honor,
because
i
think
we
should
--
i
should
respond
to
claim
that's
been
made
in
the
brief
by
the
state
and
that
was
made
here
on
oral
argument.
it's
true
that
this
film
does
not
belong
to
these
exhibitors.
the
distributor
of
this
film
is
grove
press
which
is
not
a
party
to
this
case.
grove
press
moved
to
intervene
in
the
court
below.
intervention
was
denied
on
the
ground
that
its
interest
would
be
fully
represented
by
the
exhibitor.
we
think
that
entitles
an
exhibitor
that
makes
all
the
claims
that
the
distributor
would
have
made
and
indeed,
we
submit
the
exhibitor
is
no
different
if
harris
had
an
associated.
it's
harris's
rights
to
his
pamphlet
and
he
hands
it
to
an
associate
who
isn't
smart
enough
to
write
it
himself
and
tells
them,
you
distribute
it.
i
don't
think
the
associate
has
less
rights
than
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
because
he
is
not
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
think
that's
true.
i
think
as
it
was
pointed
out
here,
it's
a
fact
which
you
referred
to
that
it's
well
known
that
this
film
has
been
doing
far
better
than
other
films.
i
don't
--
i
admit
that
the
record
doesn't
have
the
fact
on
whether
this
exhibitor
would
have
done
better
with
one
--
with
this
film
than
he
did
with
the
one
he
used
in
place
of
it.
but
i
submit
that
if
an
exhibitor
wants
to
show
film
a
and
he
is
constitutionally
entitled
to
show
it,
it
makes
no
different
that
the
state
says,
“then
you
can
show
film
b
instead.”
if
that
were
right
and
the
state
would
be
controlling
speech.
that's
the
worst
kind
of
regulation.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
he
wants
to
make
this
speech.
this
exhibitor
says,
“i
want
to
show
this
film
and
the
prosecutor
who
is
able
to
achieve
by
various
other
means.
he
is
able
to
achieve
his
lawful
ends,
which
is
to
prosecute
if
in
fact
an
offense
has
been
committed.
and
in
fact
he
has
prosecuted
and
in
fact
all
the
issues
are
going
to
be
considered
in
the
state
case.
that
prosecutor
chooses
instead
to
suppress
the
film
without
statutory
authority,
without
the
benefit
of
any
procedure
that's
been
authorized
by
any
state
court,
suppress
the
film
simply
by
threatening
it
to
death
and
that's
what
this
prosecutor
has
done.
he
has
threatened
this
film
to
death.
he
simply
closed
it
up
by
saying,
“if
you
don't
close
it
up,
i'll
just
prosecute
you
and
i'll
seize
you
and
i'll
prosecute
you
again
and
there
is
no
exhibitor.”
we
submit
that
even
an
exhibitor
who
is
willing
to
run
the
risk
and
our
client
is
willing
to
run
the
risk
of
ultimate
jail
sentence.
he
is
under
a
one
year
jail
term.
even
a
prosecute
--
even
an
exhibitor
who
is
willing
to
run
the
risk
is
not
prepared
to
be
hold
into
court
everyday
to
answer
a
new
indictment
everyday
to
plea,
to
have
his
film
seized,
to
have
to
retain
mirage
of
attorneys
in
order
to
be
able
to
show
a
film
which
an
important
element
which
i
think
i
haven't
mentioned
at
all,
this
is
the
fact
that
this
is
the
film
which
the
court
below
knew
and
which
this
court
can
certainly
take
judicial
notice
of
had
been
found
constitutionally
protected
by
united
states
court
of
appeals.
so
we're
not
dealing
with
just
some
--
whatever
it
may
be
hardcore
pornography.
we're
dealing
with
the
film
which
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
has
said
in
a
suit
court
by
the
united
states
is
subject
to
constitutional
protection.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
think
so
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
maybe
a
fine
reading
of
the
opinion.
and
i
think
(voice
overlap).
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
no.
i
just
mean,
my
proposed
reading
of
it
but
at
the
top
to
page
33,
judge
aldrich
says,
“for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
we'll
assume
that
the
film
is
obscene
by
standards
currently
applied
by
the
massachusetts
court
footnote,
another
court
viewing
the
same
film
is
different,
united
states
versus
“i
am
curious
(yellow).”
i
think
what
judge
aldrich
was
saying
is,
well
alright,
the
massachusetts
court
has,
we
know
(inaudible),
will
assume
arguendo
that
that
would
be
upheld
but
it
is
by
no
means,
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination,
totally
work
was
hardcore
pornography.
it's
a
film
which
maybe
massachusetts
will
find
obscene,
the
second
circuit
has
found
not
obscene.
and
i
think
that's
an
important
element
in
deciding
whether
that
film
should
be
entitled
to
be
shown
in
the
interim
while
these
appellees
are
making
their
way
through
the
massachusetts
courts
and
being
forced
to
assert
in
those
courts
every
right,
every
claim
that
they
might
have.
the
federal
court
has
entertained
in
effect,
no
substantive
claim
either
factual
or
constitutional
other
than
the
claim
essential
to
what
they're
entitled
to
interim.
mr.
nathan
lewin
they're
been
instituted
by
a
complaint
in
addition
to
the
one
in
boston.
i
think
three
others?
three
others
in
all
that
account.
mr.
nathan
lewin
they're
just
waiting
really.
of
course
this
court
has
the
obscenity
vel
non
as
one
of
the
issues
of
this
film
on
its
docket
in
number
905
which
should
be
heard
next
term.
so
i
think
they're
probably
just
awaiting
the
outcome
of
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
they
all
played
one
day
and
let
me
say
again.
what
the
district
court
means
that
each
one
of
those
exhibitors
also
will
be
forced
to
a
criminal
trial
and
we're
not
contesting
that,
we
haven't
appealed
the
abstention
issues
and
all
the
federalism
issues
would
be
presented
in
this
case,
had
we
appealed,
the
district
court's
refusal
to
enjoin
the
ongoing
state
proceeding.
we
did
not
appeal
that.
so
therefore,
the
abstention
should
be
just
on
here.
the
district
court
has
in
fact,
no
matter
what
said
has
in
fact
abstained
and
the
only
issue
that's
here
on
this
appeal
is
what
happens
in
the
interim.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we're
not
exhibiting
the
film.
we
got
a
--
and
with
our
speech
in
a
plainest
sense
is
being
suppressed.
we
are
just
not
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
i
don't
think
it
is,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
no
more
our
choice
than
it
was
the
choice
of
viva
maria
in
interstate
circuit
not
to
exhibit
that
film
or
the
exhibitor
exhibiting
it
because
the
informal
censorship
or
the
interstate
circuit
case
had
found
the
juveniles
should
not
be
allowed
to
see
that
film
and
this
court
struck
down
in
the
interstate
circuit
case.
a
system
under
which
it
noted
self
regulation
would
be
the
result
in
smith
and
california.
it
was
bookseller's
own
individual
choice
not
to
sell
books
if
he
hasn't
read
them
but
that's
not
a
defense.
if
the
state
is
forcing
to
that
choice,
it's
not
a
choice
at
all
and
that's
really
what
the
state
is
doing
with
no
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
because
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
zwickler
and
koota
certainly
established
that
bad
faith
is
not
an
essential
element
in
getting
the
--
in
the
federal
courts
getting
in
to
these
cases.
we
submit
that
here,
there's
an
alternative
reason
which
just
didn't
exist
in
dombrowski
because
in
dombrowski,
again,
the
prospect
of
interference
with
speech
was
off
in
some
future
date.
it's
true
there
were
general
allegations
about
it
and
general
allegations
of
harassment
and
bad
faith.
but
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
here,
you
have
a
very
evil
that
the
court
forth
was
a
prospect
in
dombrowski
because
what
the
court
was
concerned
about
in
dombrowski
was
that
the
conduct
of
the
prosecutor
was
going
to
chill
the
expression
of
first
amendment
rights.
it
was
going
to
prevent
mr.
dombrowski
from
expressing
his
views.
in
this
case,
what
the
prosecutor
has
done
has
in
the
most
demonstrable
way,
achieve
that
result.
it
doesn't
only
have
the
prospect
to
do
it
but
it's
achieved.
moreover,
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
it's
chilled
to
death,
that's
right.
it
just
can't
be
shown.
it's
just
dead.
and
with
motion
pictures,
we
submit
that
the
essence.
if
you
can't
show
a
film
that's
being
nationally
distributed
at
the
time
when
it
is
nationally
reviewed
in
national
magazines,
people
just
won't
be
interested
in
it
anymore.
mr.
nathan
lewin
which
we
think
is
a
permissible
con
--
this
court
it
is
repeatedly
recognized
as
a
permissible
constitutional
consideration.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
what
the
new
york
times
case
was
all
about
and
the
court
said
back
indeed
in
ginsberg.
this
court
went
out
of
its
way
to
specifically
say
that
has
no
part
of
our
decision
in
this
case
the
fact
that
money
is
being
made.
but
i
think
the
distinction
from
dombrowski
is
even
greater
than
that.
i
think
there's
really
a
fallacy
in
trying
to
compare
this
with
dombrowski.
we're
not
in
the
dombrowski
ballpark
because
we're
not
talking
here
that
the
federal
court
invalidating
the
state
statute.
in
dombrowski,
the
plaintiffs
went
in
specifically
to
move
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts
the
question
of
the
federal
constitutionality
of
the
state
statute.
that's
not
in
this
case
at
all.
so
we're
not
really
in
dombrowski
in
that
situation.
we
don't
need
a
dombrowski
exception.
mr.
nathan
lewin
professor
de
grazia
time.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
when
this
case
was
argued
last
term,
among
those
argued
with
it
was
gunn
versus
university
committee,
number
7
last
term.
and
which
the
court
dismissed
the
appeal
on
the
last
day
of
the
term,
when
it
set
this
case
and
its
other
companions
over
for
re-argument.
on
the
ground
that
the
three-judge
district
court
in
gunn
had
failed
to
enter
any
injunctive
order,
whatever.
and
it
was
therefore,
quoting
the
court’s
language,
“not
possible
to
know,
with
any
certainty
what
the
court
has
decided.”
in
this
case,
by
contrast,
the
appealed
order
is
short
and
specific.
and
it
clearly
discloses
what
the
court
below
has
decided.
and
we
submit
that
if
that
injunction
is
analyzed
in
terms
of
what
it
does
not
enjoin,
as
well
as
in
terms
of
what
it
does.
it
emerges
as
a
permissible
and
proper
action,
by
a
federal
district
court,
seeking
to
preserve
for
state
prosecutors
and
courts,
their
proper
role
in
the
enforcement
of
restrictions,
upon
the
distribution
of
obscenity,
while
retaining
the
first
amendment
rights
of
motion
picture
exhibitors
and
distributors
in
the
interim.
to
the
extent,
i
would
submit,
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
goes
beyond
the
terms
of
the
preliminary
injunction
and
expresses
views
concerning
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
ultimate
decision.
it's
nothing
more
than
an
advisory
opinion
or
as
was
suggested
in
some
of
the
cases
argued
before
the
court
yesterday,
in
terms
of
declaratory
judgment,
which
maybe
appealable
by
the
state,
if
it
views
it
is
such
to
the
court
of
appeals.
but,
the
issue
here,
we
submit,
is
framed
by
the
injunction,
which
appears
at
pages
44
and
45
of
this
record.
now,
what
does
it
enjoin?
the
injunction
prohibits
and
enjoins
the
defendants,
the
state
prosecutors,
local
district
attorney
and
the
state
attorney
general’s
office
from
proceedings
civilly
or
criminally
or
otherwise
interfering
with
the
appellee's
exhibition
of
the
film,
“i
am
curious
yellow”
so
long
as
that
exhibition
is
conducted
under
certain
specific
circumstances,
which
cover
the
areas
of
pandering,
and
intrusion.
and
it
provides
in
addition,
that
the
order
is
not
to
prevent
or
inhibit
in
any
way,
the
prosecution
of
a
then
pending
criminal
proceeding
in
the
massachusetts
states
courts,
which
was
then
on
appeal,
from
a
judgment
of
conviction
and
which
the
motion
picture
exhibitors,
who
are
perfectly
legitimate
theater
owners
and
have
shown
award
winning
films
in
the
past
was
sentenced
to
one
year
in
jail
for
having
shown
this
film.
now
let
me,
if
i
may
just
clarify
for
a
moment,
just
to
clarify
the
status
of
that
case,
in
the
massachusetts
state
court
and
supplement
somewhat
on
what
mr.
quinn
has
advised
the
court.
that
case,
those
convictions,
were
appealed
to
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court,
briefs
were
filed.
in
the
state’s
brief,
which
was
response
to
the
appealles
brief
in
the
state
court,
the
state
concluded
with
the
following
language.
since--speaking
of
this
court,
that
court’s
adjudication
in
the
maryland
case,
which
was
argued
here
last
term,
will
bind
the
commonwealth,
it
is
respectfully
suggested
that
this
court,
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court,
hold
its
decision
upon
the
obscenity
of
the
film,
in
abeyance,
pending
that
adjudication,
not
the
adjudication
of
this
case,
but
the
adjudication
of
the
maryland
case,
and
which
the
obscenity
of
the
film
is
an
issue.
pursuant
to
that
suggestion,
these
appellees,
feeling
that
that
issue
would
be
resolved
ultimately
by
this
court,
even
irrespective
of
how
they
would
resolve
by
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
moved
that
the
issue
of
obscenity
and
that
issue
alone
await
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
maryland
case.
but
that
the
other
issues
be
considered
by
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court.
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
acting
on
that
notion
staid
the
entire
argument
of
the
case,
so
the
entire
argument
is
staid
true
in
form
on
our
motion.
but,
really
at
the
suggestion
of
the
state
that
the
maryland
case
would
be
dispositive
of
the
issue
of
obscenity,
which
i
think
is
plain
truth.
if
the
court
were
to
--
there
were
of
course,
other
issues
in
the
maryland
case,
that
assume
that
the
court
were
to
reach
the
issue
of
obscenity
in
the
maryland
case,
and
were
to
decide
that
question
one
way
or
the
other.
of
course,
resolution
of
that
issue,
i
might
say
might
very--if
it
were
resolved
in
favor
of
the
film,
might
very
well
have
the
effective
mooting
out
this
very
case,
as
well.
because
the
sole
issue
here
is
whether
these
exhibitors
may
continue
to
exhibit
this
film
in
the
interim.
now--
mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
i
agree,
they
would
be
subject
to
punishment.
i
think
--
let
me
just
say,
for
purposes
for
our
own
argument
and
with
the
court’s
permission,
the
matters
of
the
issues
discussed
by
the
assistant
to
the
solicitor
general,
the
stanley
issue
and
all
that
--
all
those
ramifications
of
that
issue
were
to
be
covered
in
our
argument,
by
professor
dershowitz,
my
colleague,
who
will
be
arguing
the
second
half
of
the
argument.
now,
we
will
definitely
address
ourselves
to
those
questions,
in
this
portion
of
the
argument,
i
would
limit
my
argument
to
--
as
it
were
the
dombrowski,
the
abstention,
the
federalism
issues--
mr.
nathan
lewin
thank
you
very
much.
i’m
afraid
that
on
the
question
of
the
federalism
and
the
federal
court's
role
in
this
case.
some
confusion
may
have
been
engendered
by
papers,
which
we
filed
at
--
upon
the
application
of
the
state
for
stay
last
term.
when
it
appeared,
i
believe
just
from
those
papers
is
if
in
some
way,
the
federal
district
court
in
this
case,
was
barging
into
a
state
prosecution.
if
anything,
the
record
in
this
case
demonstrate,
we
submit,
that
what
the
district
court
below
did
was
at
successive
stages
of
this
litigation
defer
and
refused
to
act
until
the
juncture
was
reached,
at
which
if
it
failed
to
act,
speech
which
was
eminent,
pending,
and
in
fact,
had
continued
until
the
date
of
its
action,
would
not
merely
be
chilled.
if
i
may
proceed
from
the
court’s
metaphor,
but
would
in
fact
be
put
in
the
deep
freeze,
because
the
consequence
of
the
action,
which
caused
the
federal
district
court
to
issue
the
preliminary
injunction,
which
it
did,
was
the
withdrawal
by
the
prosecutor,
in
the
state
courts,
of
an
agreement
under
which
he
would
permit
the
film
to
continue
to
show
while
the
various
issues
were
being
litigated
through
the
massachusetts
courts.
in
fact,
what
did
the
court
below
do?
its
order
plainly
demonstrates
that
the
court
permitted
the
one
pending
state
prosecution
to
go
on.
in
addition
to
that,
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
and
the
language
of
judge
aldrich,
who
wrote
the
opinion,
which
appears
at
page
37
of
the
record,
concludes
with
an
explicit
caveat
to
these
appellees,
stating
that
the
court
voices
no
opinion,
as
to
the
legal
consequences
if
plaintiffs
exhibit
their
film,
under
the
protection
of
our
injunction,
and
it
is
ultimately
determined
that
our
view
was
mistaken,
and
that
such
exhibition
was
properly
considered
elicit.
in
effect,
what
that
language
in
judge
aldrich
opinion
states
is
that
the
continued
exhibition
of
the
film,
even
under
the
protection
of
the
injunction
is
still
subject
to
the
risk
that
at
the
conclusion
of
whatever
ultimate
decision
is
reached
on
the
various
constitutional
issues,
these
appellees
maybe
prosecuted,
in
fact
retrospectively
for
the
showing
of
the
film,
which
they
engaged
in
during
the
entire
period
of
the
litigation.
so
that
is
if
there
is
anything
that’s
clear
from
the
terms
and
the
order,
it
is
that
in
no
way
forecloses
any
state
court
determination
of
any
relevant
issue
and
in
fact
doesn’t
--
not
only
under
dombrowski
doesn’t
enjoin
any
state
prosecution
but
any
pending
state
prosecution,
but
doesn’t
even
enjoin
future
state
prosecutions.
at
most
it
defers
them
if
they’re
legitimate
to
some
ultimate
date
at
which
if
they
can
properly
be
brought
they
can
then
be
instituted.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no
your
honor,
we
think
it
does
not
enjoin.
mr.
nathan
lewin
what
it
means
is
that
the
prosecutor
may
not
in
the
period
of
time
until
the
issues
are
resolved,
institute
civil
or
criminal
proceedings
or
seize
that
film.
but
the
language
of
judge
aldrich
that
appears
on
page
37—
mr.
nathan
lewin
i’m
referring
to
the
order.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that’s
right,
and
the
order
enjoins
the
institution
of
proceedings.
it
does
not
however
say
that
if
the
film
has
finally
found
obscene,
these
appellees
may
not
then
be
prosecuted
for
having
showing
the
film
in
the
interim.
if
the
case
is
viewed
as
we
think
it
properly
should
be
as
to
what
are
the
appropriate
steps
for
a
federal
district
court
to
take
when
it
has
before
a
case
in
which
there
is
some
doubt
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
under
which
the
state
is
proceeding
where
the
state
has
no
injunction
power.
and
i
think
that’s
important
in
this
context.
the
state
of
massachusetts
has
not
authorized
each
prosecutors
to
go
into
court
and
obtain
injunctions
against
the
showing
of
films.
it
has
an
interim
proceeding
applicable
to
books
but
none
with
respect
to
films.
so
it
authorizes
criminal
prosecution.
now
there
is
a
criminal
prosecution
with
respect
to
a
film
under
a
statute
which
is
a
questionable
constitutionality
with
respect
to
a
film
which
a
federal
district
court
has
found
prior
to
its
opening
to
be
not
obscene.
and
judge
aldrich
took
notice
of
that
too
and
that
appears
in
his
opinion.
and
the
film
is
shown
under
very
careful
safeguards
to
avoid
pandering,
any
showing
to
minors,
any
intrusion
on
the
public.
in
those
circumstances,
the
federal
district
court
says
in
the
interim
until
the
issues
are
resolved
we
think
you
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
show
that
film
subject
possibly
to
future
prosecution
for
you
having
shown
it,
but
you
will
not
be
hold
into
court
everyday
and
indicted
everyday
and
have
the
film
seized
everyday
because
you
are
showing
it
because
that
would
in
effect
be
a
form
of
censorship.
a
form
of
censorship
by
threat
to
be
sure
but
it
would
be
a
form
of
censorship.
and
we
submit
that
that’s
under
all
doctrines
of
nonintervention
or
abstention
or
whatever
federal
policy
applies
we
think
that’s
appropriate.
the
court
below
stayed
its
hand
until
that
point
where
the
threat
the
prosecutor
to
make
--
to
continue
to
prosecute
and
to
indict
and
seize
the
film
had
the
effect
of
an
effect
of
closing
it
down.
now
let
me—
mr.
nathan
lewin
six
years
so
that
there’s
no
question
that
that
it
would
be
within
the
statute
if
prosecutions
were
subsequently
brought.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
six
years
from
any
criminal
act
which
would
be
the
showing
--
any
showing
if
they
are
to
be
prosecuted—
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
that
should
be
true
mr.
chief
justice,
but
there
is
one
there
is
already
a
prosecution.
the
problem
that
this
case
presents
is
that
a
showing
of
the
film
can
be
subject
to
multiple
prosecutions.
these
appellees
have
assumed
the
risk
of
a
single
prosecution
and
indeed
they
are
prepared
to
assume
even
the
risk
of
multiple
prosecutions
if
they’re
proved
wrong.
the
only
thing
that
they
seek
and
that
they
obtain
from
--
they
sought
more
but
the
only
thing
that
they
obtained
from
the
district
court
was
an
order
which
prevented
multiple
prosecutions
while
the
film
was
being
shown,
while
the
litigation
was
going
on,
and
while
their
rights
were
still
an
issue.
at
that
period
of
time,
we
submit
they’re
entitled
to
federal
relief
to
permit
the
film
to
show
in
the
interim
until
that
date
when
it
is
finally
decided
whether
they’re
right
or
wrong.
mr.
nathan
lewin
to
that
extent
we
agree
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
it’s
because
it’s
an
interference
with
a
state
criminal
process
to
obtain
rights
which
could
not
be
obtained
in
the
state
criminal
process
mr.
justice
harlan.
in
other
words,
assuming
even
assuming
that
the
law
were
which
i
think
this
court’s
cases
have
conclusively
established
otherwise,
but
even
assuming
the
law
were
that
one
had
to
exhaust
state
remedies,
as
it
were
to
obtain
relief
from
a
federal
district
court
in
a
free
speech
case,
in
these
circumstances,
there
is
no
way
that
these
appellees
could
say
and
in
fact
obtain
the
right
to
show
the
film
while
its
obscenity
was
being
--
the
matter
of
its
obscenity
was
being
litigated.
they
couldn’t
obtain
that
in
a
defense
to
a
state
criminal
prosecution.
there’s
just
no
way
they
could.
they
can
defend
the
state
criminal
prosecution,
they
can
say
we’re
not
guilty,
put
the
state
to
the
test
of
proving
the
obscenity
of
the
film.
but
when
they
want
to
show
the
film
on
november
12,
1969
and
thereafter,
the
only
remedy
they
have
is
to
go
into
a
federal
district
court
at
that
point
and
say,
“we
institute
this
action
and
seek
this
relief.
we
have
a
right
to
show
the
film
on
november
13th
and
14th
and
15th
while
it’s
obscenity
is
being
tested
under
the
state
criminal
process.”
now,
that
we
submit
is
a
permissible
interference.
what
the
cases
prior
to
dumbrowski
and
what
the
general
principle
of
nonintervention
of
federal
courts
and
state
criminal
process
involves
we
submit,
are
only
those
instances
where
the
same
relief
or
the
relief
that
the
plaintiffs
are
seeking
could
be
obtained
from
the
state
process.
here,
that’s
just
not
possible.
these
appellees,
so
far
as
trying
to
show
the
film
in
the
interim
could
not
obtain
any
relief
from
the
state
courts.
they
could
defend
the
criminal
prosecution.
if
the
state
had
had
an
injunctive
procedure
under
which
the
state
prosecutor
could
go
into
state
court
and
seek
an
injunction
then
they
would
have
that
remedy
in
a
state
court.
they
could
defend
against
bad
injunctive
proceeding.
of
course,
if
the
state
prosecutor
decided
not
to
institute
it,
they
would
never
have
it.
but
assuming
it
did
--
they
could
defend
and
litigate
the
right
of
showing
the
film
in
the
interim,
there
is
no
such
procedure.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
has
a
declaratory
judgment
procedure
mr.
justice
stewart.
however,
the
standards
that
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
applies
in
the
declaratory
judgment
cases
indicate
that
this
issue
could
not
be
raised.
we
have
this
pending,
i
think
on
this
court’s
docket
now
is
the
case
involving
the
obscenity
of
the
stage
play
hare
—
the
pbic
versus
byrne,
which
involved
an
attempt
to
obtain
a
declaratory
judgment
from
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
which
was
subject
to
various
state
objections
that
the
state
raised
in
that
case.
and
that
case
demonstrates
how
hard
it
would
be
even
to
obtain
a
declaratory
judgment
on
the
initial
question,
which
is
the
obscenity
of
the
film.
but
certainly,
in
terms
of
the
right
to
show
it
in
the
interim,
which
is
really
what
we
say
is
at
stake
here
and
all
that
is
involved
in
this
injunction
that
right
could
not
be
asserted
in
the
state
court.
and
it
certainly
could
not
be
asserted
in
a
defense
to
a
criminal
prosecution
because
the
only
issue
in
the
criminal
prosecution
would
be
whether
the
film
is
obscene,
whether
all
the
other
constitution
and
statutory
standards
are
met
and
the
judgment
of
conviction
and
not
whether
the
film
would
be
shown
of
the
13th
or
any
other
days.
on
this
general
principle
of
nonintervention,
if
i
may
just
address
myself
to
it
briefly,
this
court’s
decisions
ranging
way
back
and
certainly
commentating
in
zwickler
and
khuta
have
made
it
clear.
i
think
zwickler
and
khuta,
the
court
quoted
from
a
district
court
opinion
which
made
it,
and
i
just
quote
that
briefly.
the
court
said,
“we
yet
like
to
believe
that
wherever
the
federal
court
sit,
human
rights
under
the
federal
constitution
are
always
a
proper
subject
for
adjudication,
and
that
we
have
not
the
right
to
decline
the
exercise
of
that
jurisdiction
simply
because
the
rights
asserted
and
they
be
adjudicated
in
some
other
form.”
now
here,
in
this
case
we
submit
follows
a
fortiori
from
zwickler
and
dombrowski
and
all
the
others
because
the
right
that’s
covered
by
this
preliminary
injunction
and
let
me
emphasize
it
is
a
preliminary
injunction
and
therefore
the
standards
that
ordinarily
apply
to
preliminary
injunction,
we
submit
should
be
applied.
in
other
words,
district
courts
have
broad
discretion
to
decide
on
the
probabilities
of
success
of
the
ultimate
outcome
of
the
litigation
and
issue
preliminary
injunctions
in
those
terms.
here
we
deal
with
a
preliminary
injunction
and
we
submit
for
that
reason
certainly,
rights
which
couldn’t
be
asserted
in
a
state
court,
which
these
appellees
had
no
way
of
asserting
in
a
state
court
should
properly
or
properly
protected
by
the
federal
district
court
and
should
be
affirmed
here.
now
i
would
like
--
if
i
may
just
briefly
to
go
to
the
question
of
the
effect
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
which
was
raised
also
in
the
argument
last
week
before
this
court,
and
which
we
think
applies
to
these
circumstances
as
well.
one
has
here
a
set
of
facts
in
which
what
the
state
prosecutors
have
sought
to
do
was
prevent
the
exhibition
of
a
film
under
a
statute
which
the
court
below
found
and
we
submit
properly
a
subject
to
constitutional
challenge.
when
that
film
itself
had
prior
to
its
opening
been
found
to
be
constitutionally
protected
by
united
states
court
of
appeals.
now,
we
don’t
argue
and
of
course
we
couldn’t
argue
that
defining
of
united
states
court
of
appeals
is
binding
on
the
state
of
massachusetts
as
a
matter
of
res
judicata.
what
we
do
argue
and
we
elaborate
then
the
distributor
who’s
the
appellant
in
the
maryland
case
elaborates
at
some
length
and
our
brief
in
that
case
and
we
think
it
applies
here
as
well,
is
that
there
--
in
terms
of
protecting
and
giving
wide
scope
to
free
expression
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
and
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
indeed
any
decision
which
is
binding
on
the
united
states,
should
as
a
matter
of
first
amendment
law
be
applied
by
this
court
to
bar
other
proceedings
to
prevent
the
exhibitions
of
the
very
same
material.
now
that’s
just
a
very
--
in
terms
of
the
practical
consequence
on
distributors
and
exhibitors
of
films
and
books
that’s
just
a
very
important
rule.
this
court
has
on
its
docket
right
now
pending
in
one
form
or
another
five
cases
involving
the
exhibition
of
this
film,
five
cases
out
of
the
states
of
alabama,
florida,
massachusetts,
maryland
and
ohio
all
involving
the
exhibition
of
this
film.
as
was
stated
in
the
brief
in
the
maryland
case
there
were
144
lawsuits
in
the
country
involving
the
exhibitions
of
this
film
essentially
in
the
distribution
of
films
and
books
throughout
the
united
states
to
put
a
distributor
or
an
exhibitor
who
has
established
to
the
satisfaction
of
a
court
of
appeals
and
a
judgment
binding
on
the
united
states
which
could
have
enjoined
by
states
throughout
the
united
states.
that
a
film
or
a
book
is
constitutionally
protected
must
we
submit
act
to
prevent
future
harassment,
multiplicities
of
litigation
which
otherwise
makes
the
distribution
of
such
first
amendment
material
or
arguable
first
amendment
material
close
to
impossible.
and
that’s
why
the
argument
made
is
essentially
that
that
judgment
although
not
operative
as
a
matter
of
res
judicata
should
like
various
other
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
found
judgments
binding
on
the
united
states
in
the
search
and
seizure
area,
in
the
self-incrimination
area
to
be
in
effect
have
operative
affect
on
state
prosecutors
and
state
bodies
that
that
very
same
rule
should
be
applied
in
the
field
of
arguable
obscenity
in
the
filed
of
books
or
movies
that
are
distributed
nationwide
that
go
through
a
federal
proceeding
that
are
conclusively
adjudicated
by
a
federal
court
as
being
constitutionally
protected
and
should
be—we
submit
free
of
multiplicities
and
repeated
suits
in
various
local
jurisdiction.
mr.
nathan
lewin
a
license
in
the
sense
that
it
gave
us
a
first
amendment
shield.
we
think
that
if
--
this
is
a
one
need
to
parade
horribles.
the
history
of
this
case—
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
right,
the
history
of
this
case
shows
and
this
movie
shows
what
the
contrary
result
--
or
what
the
absence
of
such
a
rule
really
results
in,
which
is—
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
rationale
is
that
if
vis-a-vis,
the
united
states
material
is
found
to
be
constitutionally
protected
under
the
first
amendment,
states
which
have
had
an
opportunity
to
enter
that
litigation
assuming
it’s
a
judgment,
which
have
had
an
opportunity
to
enter
that
litigation
should
not
thereafter,
as
a
matter
of
first
amendment
law
be
able
to
inhibit
its
distribution,
sale
and
publication
by
under
local
ordinances.
mr.
nathan
lewin
because
if
the
right
to
free
speech,
the
first
amendment
right,
is
to
be
given
the
breathing
space
it
needs
which
this
court
has
referred
to
in
various
occasions,
the
danger
to
it
of
threats
of
multiplicities
litigation
must
be
prevented.
in
other
words,
it’s
simply
as
it
were
a
preventive
rule,
a
prophylactic
rule
that
we
submit
the
court
should
adopt
to
prevent
the
very
kind
of
situation
which
is
a
reason
with
regards
to
this
film.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think—
mr.
nathan
lewin
it’s
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
prefer
to
call
it
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i’d
prefer
to
call
it
a
federal
shield,
but
i
think
that’s
essentially
what
it
is
that’s
right,
but
only
in
a
litigation.
let
me
say
federal
license,
which
can’t
just
be
granted
unilaterally
but
only
in
litigation
where
the
state
has
the
opportunity
to
come
in.
that’s
really
our
argument
we
think
of
the
state
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
if
it
said
the
film
was
obscene
it
wouldn’t
be
here
mr.
justice
harlan,
it’d
be
out
of
the
country
and
we
couldn’t
have
brought
it
in.
of
course
we
would
have
taken
it
up
to
this
court
but
it
just
wouldn’t
be
here.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
that
could
be
contested.
i
think
if
a
state
were
to
say
they’ve
added
things
to
the
movie,
i
think
that’s
an
appropriate
issue
that
a
state
may
consider.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
would
be
if—but
i
think
in
this
case
i
must
say
its
totally
undisputed
that
the
very
same
versions
of
the
film
were
being
shown
all
over
the
country.
but—
mr.
nathan
lewin
it’s
true,
that’s
true
but
it’s
awfully
cold
in
maryland,
massachusetts,
alabama,
florida
and
ohio.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
problem
with
that
mr.
justice
marshall
of
course
is
that
you’re
imposing
an
added
burden
to
obtain
material
which
is
subject
to
constitutional
protection.
we
think
that’s
not
proper.
you
can’t
just
say
“well,
since
if
we
allow
it
in
various
regions
of
the
country
where
people
can
reach
it
by
traveling
that’s
good
enough.”
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think,
well
in
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
is
what
we’re
saying.
we
don’t
have
an
obligation
to
litigate
if
we
litigate
against
the
united
states
in
a
case
where
--
in
a
federal
court
where
the
states
and
local
jurisdictions
could
come
in
if
they
wanted.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh!
yes.
if
it
wanted
to
claim
that
the
film
should
not
be
shown
in
hawaii,
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
where
the
burden
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
difference
is
that
the
state
of
hawaii
has
no
constitutional
right
not
to
be
in
a
new
york
federal
district
court.
what
we
maintain,
and
i
think
what
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
dombrowski
and
prior
to
would
have
said
is
that
what
the
first
amendment
requires,
in
terms
of
breathing
space
is
prevent
where
necessary
even
unnecessary
multiplicities
repeated
litigation.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
what
the
dombrowski
could
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
what
the
dombrowski
opinion
does
say
is
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
no
i
don’t
--
but
what
the
dombrowski
opinion
does
say
is
that
the
threat
of
sanctions
and
that
--
by
imposing
on
a
party
who’s
exercising
a
first
amendment
right,
the
obligation
to
go
through
repeated
litigation
that
in
itself
will
deter
speech.
and
i
think,
your
honor,
adverted
exactly
to
that
in
the
interstate
circuit
case.
there
is
language
in
the
interstate
circuit
case
which
talks
about
the
fact
that
the
ordinance
of
the
city
of
dallas,
if
other
cities
do
the
same
thing,
will
have
an
inhibiting
effect
on
the
motion
picture
industry
in
hollywood.
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
the
licensing
statute
in
that
case
was
struck
down
and
your
honor
referred
to
the
fact
that
if
dallas
could
do
what
it
does,
then
every
other
city
could
do
what
it
wanted
to
do
and
the
result
would
be
that
those
who
produced
films
would
not
produce
anything
that’s
even
close
to
the
line.
that’s
exactly
what
we’re
talking
about
here.
if
this
film
can
be
subjected
to
a
144
lawsuits
and
five
trips
to
this
court,
then
people
are
obviously
deterred
from
producing
any
films
which
maybe
subject
to
litigation.
mr.
nathan
lewin
in
terms
of
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
you
mean
motion
pictures
that
are
close
to
the
line
if
that
--
i
think
the
real
test
is
whether
the
effect
of
litigation
is
inhibiting
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
i
think
your
honor
with
all
respect
i
think
it
has
been
chilled
with
regard
to
legitimate
distributors
and
exhibits.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
can
only
say
that
the
distributor
of
this
film
has
incurred
very
very
substantial
cost
in
litigating
these
issues
through
the
various
courts
and
that
in
fact
it
is
bound
to
be
an
inhibitory
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don’t
think
so,
but
i
just
an
alternative
ground
that
i
think
we
have
relied
on
in
the
brief
and
that
i
just
wanted
to
discuss
somewhat
on
not
a
lot.
