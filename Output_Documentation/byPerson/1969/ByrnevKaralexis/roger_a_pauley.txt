mr.
roger
a.
pauley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
should
like
to
indicate
as
our
amicus
brief
shows
and
as
general
quinn
has
pointed
out
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
is
limited
to
that
aspect
of
the
district
court's
decision
that
considered
and
interpreted
with
this
court's
holding
in
stanley
versus
georgia.
we
therefore
take
no
position
on
the
procedural
issue
that
is
also
involved
in
this
case
and
it
has
been
the
subject
to
extensive
briefing
an
argument
by
the
parties.
i
should
like
also
to
note
the
reasons
for
the
government's
interest
in
this
case
as
the
court
well
knows
the
federal
government
as
well
as
the
states
has
laws
that
bear
upon
the
matter
of
obscenity.
the
government
bans
the
importation
of
obscene
materials
and
the
federal
government
again
through
a
statute
enacted
by
congress
proscribes
the
interstate
mailing
transportation
through
the
mails
of
obscene
materials.
in
addition,
as
a
treaty
that
the
united
states
is
a
party
too
that
the
court
referred
to
in
the
roth
case
in
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion
that
requires
the
united
states
to
take
necessary
steps
to
prohibit
the
international
traffic
in
obscene
materials.
moreover,
we
have
a
number
of
pending
cases
as
we
refer
to
in
our
amicus
brief
in
which
the
issue
of
meaning
and
effect
of
stanley
is
centrally
raised.
those
cases
are
working
their
way
up
to
this
court
but
because
this
case
is
being
considered
this
term
and
those
cases
will
not
--
we
thought
it's
appropriate
to
express
our
views
on
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
stanley
at
this
point
not
to
run
the
risk
of
not
having
an
opportunity
to
do
so.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
yes,
that's
correct
and
based
essentially
on
the
same
reading
of
the
opinion
in
stanley
as
(voice
overlap).
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
as
your
honor
knows
the
issue
of
obscenity
is
one
that
has
divided
the
court
perhaps
more
than
any
other
issue
in
recent
times
and
we're
of
course
aware
of
your
position
and
the
position
of
mr.
justice
douglas
on
the
matter.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
your
honor
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
your
honor,
that's
one
--
as
i
understand
it,
that's
one
aspect
of
several
what
the
court
has
applied
in
determining
obscenity.
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
is
no,
and
i
think
it
would
really
be
an
insult
to
the
intelligence
of
those
justices
and
judges
and
counsel
who
have
struggled
over
the
last
15
or
20
years
to
come
at
a
definition
to
suggest
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
to
suggest
that
we
--
you're
quite
right.
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
in
cases
taken
and
considered
on
the
merits,
this
court
his
count
then
was
55
separate
opinions
and
it's
over
60
now.
it's
a
very
difficult
problem
but
i
would
suggest
that
one
way
of
looking
at
it
as
attorney
general
quinn
did
is
that
it
is
a
problem
that
the
legislative
branch,
both
of
the
state
and
the
federal
level
has
some
role
to
play
in
and
the
statutes
that
the
states
have
enacted
and
the
congress
has
enacted,
they
have
sought
to
reflect
as
best
as
they
can,
this
court's
articulation
of
the
pertinent
constitutional
standards.
there
is
that
the
chief
justice
indicated
a
penumbra
where
an
individual
has
to
make
a
very
difficult
choice.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
choice
as
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
i
think
that's
correct
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
that's
limited
to
the
area
of
obscenity.
i
think
that
perhaps
there's
a
heightened
impact
there
because
of
the
first
amendment
and
as
protection
of
free
expression.
but
i
don't
think
that
we
should
throw
the
whole
notion
of
obscenity
legislation
out
simply
because
it's
difficult
to
arrive
at
a
dissatisfactory
definition.
i
think
the
court
has
worked
through
the
cases
that
had
come
to
it
to
reach
such
a
definition.
we
think
that
the
definition
stated
in
roth
as
explicated
in
subsequent
cases,
memoirs
and
redrup
as
a
workable
definition
that
permits
on
the
one
hand
free
expression
of
those
ideas
that
the
framers
of
first
amendment
had
in
mind
protecting
and
yet
allows
states
and
the
federal
government
to
prevent
on
behalf
of
the
people,
material
it
has,
has
no
role
to
play
in
the
discussion
about
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
well,
your
honor,
the
court
traced
this
in
the
roth
case,
traced
the
history
of
the
first
amendment
and
it
was
quite
clear
at
the
time
that
the
first
amendment
was
adopted
and
ratified
that
there
were
obscenity
laws
on
the
books
at
that
time.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that's
correct,
your
honor
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
no,
but
i
think
the
constitution
has
to
be
read
in
the
historical
context
in
which
those
words
were
written
and
that's
what
the
court
in
roth
said
and
that's
the
point
of
departure
that
the
court
has
followed
since
that
time.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that
is
correct.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that's
correct.
there
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that's
correct.
the
first
federal
statute
was
enacted
in
1842
on
the
obscenity
question.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
there
any
better.
no
your
honor.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
i
don't
know
how
you
made
that
qualitative
evaluation.
i
think
they
have
the
same
sort
of
ambiguity
and
vagueness
in
them
that
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
your
honor
i
agree
and
i
think
as
i
indicated
mr.
justice
black.
there
are
variety
of
areas
of
the
law
in
which
there
is
an
area
of
uncertainty
and
the
language
simply
doesn't
lend
itself
to
any
better
definition
and
the
court
has
struggled
and
attempted
and
worked
and
i
assume
will
continue
to
work
with
the
refinement
of
the
standard
as
best
as
it
can
in
this
area
and
in
the
area
you
referred
to
in
another
area.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
i
think
the
chief
justice
was
suggesting
that
in
the
antitrust
field
under
the
broad
dictates
of
the
sherman
act
and
clayton
act,
this
court's
opinions
construing
those
statutes
that
there
was
at
least
as
much
ambiguity
about
those
opinions
and
the
standards
there
enunciated
as
in
the
obscenity
field.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
i
would
like
to
turn
to
stanley.
it
has
been
discussed
a
bit
but
that's
the
central
concern
for
us
and
i
should
like
to
give
the
court
the
government's
view
of
what
stanley
holds
and
what
it
doesn't
hold.
as
we
read
that
opinion
and
expressly
disclaimed
undermining
of
roth
in
its
progeny.
it
said,
instead
that
the
concern
there
was
with
the
mere
possession
of
material
that
might
be
regarded
as
obscene
and
the
privacy
of
an
individual's
home.
now,
we
suggest
that
it's
inappropriate
the
district
court
to
extrapolate
from
that
narrow
holding,
a
decision
with
what
we
regard
as
sweeping
implications
in
all
field
of
obscenity
as
it
has.
what
the
district
court
essentially
did
as
the
court
is
aware
here
as
whole
dividing
to
the
one
that
because
there
was
a
right
to
possess
privately,
materials
that
might
in
other
context
be
regarded
as
obscene,
it
was
necessarily
a
right
to
receive
them.
and
since
there
was
a
right
to
receive
them,
there
was
necessarily
a
right
to
distribute
them
and
therefore,
has
a
right
to
commercial
distribution
that
adheres
to
any
exhibitor
of
a
film
or
distributor
of
a
book
or
whatever.
we
think
that
the
court
is
wrong
in
its
logic.
we
think
that
this
court's
opinion
in
stanley
should
be
honored
for
what
it
said.
it
said
that
it
was
limited
to
the
question
of
mere
possession.
it
did
place
its
holding
on
first
amendment
grounds
but
as
we
indicated
that
the
whole
opinion
is
rather
full
of
language.
it
speaks
in
fourth
amendment
terms.
it
speaks
about
a
concern
about
privacy
in
a
man's
home.
and
i'm
not
talking
as
appellees
suggest
about
some
protected
area.
that's
been
done
away
with
by
the
court
in
the
katz
case.
what
we're
talking
about
is
an
individual's
privacy
and
i
would
suggest
if
mr.
stanley
would
like
to
carry
an
obscene
book
down
the
street,
he
could
do
that
too
and
couldn't
be
prosecuted.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
i
don't
know
where
he
would
have
acquired
it
your
honor
and
i
don't
think
that
--
i
really
don't
think
that
it
matters
where
he
acquired
it.
i
think
the
government
has
a
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
he
could
have
obtained
that
in
a
variety
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
no
your
honor,
i'm
assuming
that
he
obtained
it
from
the
same
sort
of
source
that
other
stanley
has
obtained
similar
sorts
of
materials.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
well,
he
doesn't
have.
we
know
it's
a
practical
matter
that
stanleys
can
obtain
this
material.
the
question
is
whether
the
holding
in
stanley
reaches
so
far
as
giving
constitutional
sanction
to
the
people
that
were
distributed
and
i
would
suggest
that
it
does
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
well,
i'm
not
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
i'm
not
suggesting
that
he
doesn't
have
a
right
to
acquire
and
i'm
suggesting
that
it
doesn't
extend
so
far
as
to
hold
with
distributors
have
a
right
to
disseminate
material
contrary
to
obscenity
statutes.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
yeah,
i
don't
know
where
he
get
the
film
and
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
we
made
the
basic
right
it
seems
to
me
mr.
justice
stewart.
it's
really
a
right
not
to
be
interfered
with
by
the
government
in
this
possession
and
the
right
has
as
we
think
fourth
and
the
fifth
amendment
underpinnings
that
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that
was
a
different
fourth
amendment
(voice
overlap)
yes.
but
i
would
suggest
that
there's
a
long
quote
in
there
from
olmstead
which
was
a
fourth
amendment
case
and
there's
repeated
references
to
invasions
of
privacy
and
that's
fourth
amendment
talk
as
far
as
i
read
this
court's
case.
it
seems
to
us
that
what
the
court
should
do
in
this
area
is
to
adhere
to
the
standards
that
it
has
annunciated
in
the
past
and
instead
of
the
bold
departure
that
the
district
court
here
has
suggested,
the
district
court
suggested
that
so
long
as
material
commercially
disseminated
was
adequately
controlled,
and
by
adequately
controlled,
the
district
court
suggested
not
allowing
minors
in,
no
pandering
and
not
--
and
ensuring
that
there
was
no
intrusion
into
unwilling
or
uninterested
people.
the
district
court
suggests
that
so
long
as
that
was
done
that
commercial
distribution
of
films,
book,
whatever
would
be
constitutionally
protected.
we
think
that
that's
a
misguided
notion
because
first,
it
doesn't
give
sufficient
weight
to
the
legislative
judgment
in
this
matter.
it
has
been
a
running
debate
about
the
empirical
evidence
on
the
inducement
of
obscene
materials
to
antisocial
conduct
as
the
court
knows
as
a
presidential
commission
presently
studying
this
matter.
we
don't
know
what
they're
going
to
come
up
with.
they
are
going
to
make
a
report
in
the
middle
of
this
year.
now,
i
suggest
that
a
part
of
wisdom
would
be
to
wait
and
see
what
they'd
come
up
with.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that
statute
requires
a
report
by
july
31st
this
year.
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
not
positive
that
they
are
going
to
make
it
by
then
but
that's
what
the
statute
required.
because
it
seems
to
us
--
this
is
so
because
where
you
end
up
if
you
accept
this
position
is
essentially
that
hardcore
pornography,
whatever
it
is,
assuming
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
assuming
you
can
know
it
when
you
see
it.
you
can't
--
it
will
be
allowed
in
and
the
kind
of
material
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
but
your
honor
as
you
know,
the
only
conclusion
if
you
accept
that
is
to
allow
everything
in
and
say
that
the
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
i
think
there
is
certainly
a
position
between
those
extremes
that
the
court
has
sought
to
carve
out
and
i
would
hope
that
would
continue
to
carve
it
out.
indeed,
it
seems
that
the
appellees
concede
that
the
district
court's
resolution
is
no
panacea.
this
is
the
so
called
assault
theory
or
nuisance
theory
of
obscenity.
somehow,
that's
going
to
get
the
court
out
of
all
these
problem
but
it
won't
get
them
out
of
all
these
problems.
it's
clear
that
it
won't
get
them
out
of
all
these
problems
because
in
the
first
place,
you're
going
to
have
to
decide
in
each
case
whether
these
three-pronged
test
has
been
complied
with
adequately
and
you're
going
to
have
to
decide
in
cases
where
the
distributor
or
the
exhibitor
determines
that
he
doesn't
have
to
comply
with
the
three-pronged
test.
you
still
are
going
to
have
to
apply
a
standard
of
obscenity.
so
it's
no
panacea
and
they
admit
that.
they
back
off
and
they
finally
say,
“well
maybe
what
you
should
do
is
draw
a
line
between
what's
concededly
obscene
and
possibly
obscene.”
we
suggest
that
that's
just
a
different
verbal
formulation
and
that
does
in
advance
the
inquiry
anywhere.
it
seems
to
us
finally
that
the
basic
problem
here
is
one
of
whether
this
court
should
seek
to
create
for
the
society.
a
society
that
is
concerned
about
morality,
whose
people
are
concerned
about
pornography,
create
a
fixed
and
inflexible
rule
that
prevents
legislatures
from
reflecting
the
will
of
the
people
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
court
shouldn't
do
that
and
it
hasn't
done
that
up
to
now
and
we
suggest
that
it's
not
appropriate
to
do
it.
so
if
the
court
reaches
the
issue
that's
presented
on
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
stanley,
we
suggest
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
overturn
the
district
court's
decision
and
restore
stanley
to
the
limited
and
original
meaning
that
we
think
the
court
had
in
mind.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
no
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
court
--
all
the
minds
in
the
court,
the
counsel
that
have
sought
to
assist
them
have
struggled
as
i
indicated
it
with
this
problem
for
15
or
20
years
and
i
don't
suggest
there's
a
better
formulation
that
could
be
arrived
at.
i
think
it's
a
difficult
problem
and
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
but
the
standards
of
the
court
has
annunciated,
they
give
very
wide
range
to
free
expression
and
the
court
has
moved
really
to
a
point
where
what
is
prohibited
is
essentially
the
hardcore
sort
of
pornography.
it
doesn't
really
express
ideas
that
have
any
merit
or
any
word.
it
seems
to
us
that
that's
a
sound
and
sensible
position
and
that's
a
position
that
people
and
the
legislatures
can
live
with.
thank
you.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
should
like
to
indicate
as
our
amicus
brief
shows
and
as
general
quinn
has
pointed
out
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
is
limited
to
that
aspect
of
the
district
court's
decision
that
considered
and
interpreted
with
this
court's
holding
in
stanley
versus
georgia.
we
therefore
take
no
position
on
the
procedural
issue
that
is
also
involved
in
this
case
and
it
has
been
the
subject
to
extensive
briefing
an
argument
by
the
parties.
i
should
like
also
to
note
the
reasons
for
the
government's
interest
in
this
case
as
the
court
well
knows
the
federal
government
as
well
as
the
states
has
laws
that
bear
upon
the
matter
of
obscenity.
the
government
bans
the
importation
of
obscene
materials
and
the
federal
government
again
through
a
statute
enacted
by
congress
proscribes
the
interstate
mailing
transportation
through
the
mails
of
obscene
materials.
in
addition,
as
a
treaty
that
the
united
states
is
a
party
too
that
the
court
referred
to
in
the
roth
case
in
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion
that
requires
the
united
states
to
take
necessary
steps
to
prohibit
the
international
traffic
in
obscene
materials.
moreover,
we
have
a
number
of
pending
cases
as
we
refer
to
in
our
amicus
brief
in
which
the
issue
of
meaning
and
effect
of
stanley
is
centrally
raised.
those
cases
are
working
their
way
up
to
this
court
but
because
this
case
is
being
considered
this
term
and
those
cases
will
not
--
we
thought
it's
appropriate
to
express
our
views
on
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
stanley
at
this
point
not
to
run
the
risk
of
not
having
an
opportunity
to
do
so.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
yes,
that's
correct
and
based
essentially
on
the
same
reading
of
the
opinion
in
stanley
as
(voice
overlap).
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
as
your
honor
knows
the
issue
of
obscenity
is
one
that
has
divided
the
court
perhaps
more
than
any
other
issue
in
recent
times
and
we're
of
course
aware
of
your
position
and
the
position
of
mr.
justice
douglas
on
the
matter.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
your
honor
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
your
honor,
that's
one
--
as
i
understand
it,
that's
one
aspect
of
several
what
the
court
has
applied
in
determining
obscenity.
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
is
no,
and
i
think
it
would
really
be
an
insult
to
the
intelligence
of
those
justices
and
judges
and
counsel
who
have
struggled
over
the
last
15
or
20
years
to
come
at
a
definition
to
suggest
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
to
suggest
that
we
--
you're
quite
right.
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
in
cases
taken
and
considered
on
the
merits,
this
court
his
count
then
was
55
separate
opinions
and
it's
over
60
now.
it's
a
very
difficult
problem
but
i
would
suggest
that
one
way
of
looking
at
it
as
attorney
general
quinn
did
is
that
it
is
a
problem
that
the
legislative
branch,
both
of
the
state
and
the
federal
level
has
some
role
to
play
in
and
the
statutes
that
the
states
have
enacted
and
the
congress
has
enacted,
they
have
sought
to
reflect
as
best
as
they
can,
this
court's
articulation
of
the
pertinent
constitutional
standards.
there
is
that
the
chief
justice
indicated
a
penumbra
where
an
individual
has
to
make
a
very
difficult
choice.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
choice
as
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
i
think
that's
correct
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
that's
limited
to
the
area
of
obscenity.
i
think
that
perhaps
there's
a
heightened
impact
there
because
of
the
first
amendment
and
as
protection
of
free
expression.
but
i
don't
think
that
we
should
throw
the
whole
notion
of
obscenity
legislation
out
simply
because
it's
difficult
to
arrive
at
a
dissatisfactory
definition.
i
think
the
court
has
worked
through
the
cases
that
had
come
to
it
to
reach
such
a
definition.
we
think
that
the
definition
stated
in
roth
as
explicated
in
subsequent
cases,
memoirs
and
redrup
as
a
workable
definition
that
permits
on
the
one
hand
free
expression
of
those
ideas
that
the
framers
of
first
amendment
had
in
mind
protecting
and
yet
allows
states
and
the
federal
government
to
prevent
on
behalf
of
the
people,
material
it
has,
has
no
role
to
play
in
the
discussion
about
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
well,
your
honor,
the
court
traced
this
in
the
roth
case,
traced
the
history
of
the
first
amendment
and
it
was
quite
clear
at
the
time
that
the
first
amendment
was
adopted
and
ratified
that
there
were
obscenity
laws
on
the
books
at
that
time.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that's
correct,
your
honor
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
no,
but
i
think
the
constitution
has
to
be
read
in
the
historical
context
in
which
those
words
were
written
and
that's
what
the
court
in
roth
said
and
that's
the
point
of
departure
that
the
court
has
followed
since
that
time.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that
is
correct.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that's
correct.
there
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that's
correct.
the
first
federal
statute
was
enacted
in
1842
on
the
obscenity
question.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
there
any
better.
no
your
honor.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
i
don't
know
how
you
made
that
qualitative
evaluation.
i
think
they
have
the
same
sort
of
ambiguity
and
vagueness
in
them
that
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
your
honor
i
agree
and
i
think
as
i
indicated
mr.
justice
black.
there
are
variety
of
areas
of
the
law
in
which
there
is
an
area
of
uncertainty
and
the
language
simply
doesn't
lend
itself
to
any
better
definition
and
the
court
has
struggled
and
attempted
and
worked
and
i
assume
will
continue
to
work
with
the
refinement
of
the
standard
as
best
as
it
can
in
this
area
and
in
the
area
you
referred
to
in
another
area.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
i
think
the
chief
justice
was
suggesting
that
in
the
antitrust
field
under
the
broad
dictates
of
the
sherman
act
and
clayton
act,
this
court's
opinions
construing
those
statutes
that
there
was
at
least
as
much
ambiguity
about
those
opinions
and
the
standards
there
enunciated
as
in
the
obscenity
field.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
i
would
like
to
turn
to
stanley.
it
has
been
discussed
a
bit
but
that's
the
central
concern
for
us
and
i
should
like
to
give
the
court
the
government's
view
of
what
stanley
holds
and
what
it
doesn't
hold.
as
we
read
that
opinion
and
expressly
disclaimed
undermining
of
roth
in
its
progeny.
it
said,
instead
that
the
concern
there
was
with
the
mere
possession
of
material
that
might
be
regarded
as
obscene
and
the
privacy
of
an
individual's
home.
now,
we
suggest
that
it's
inappropriate
the
district
court
to
extrapolate
from
that
narrow
holding,
a
decision
with
what
we
regard
as
sweeping
implications
in
all
field
of
obscenity
as
it
has.
what
the
district
court
essentially
did
as
the
court
is
aware
here
as
whole
dividing
to
the
one
that
because
there
was
a
right
to
possess
privately,
materials
that
might
in
other
context
be
regarded
as
obscene,
it
was
necessarily
a
right
to
receive
them.
and
since
there
was
a
right
to
receive
them,
there
was
necessarily
a
right
to
distribute
them
and
therefore,
has
a
right
to
commercial
distribution
that
adheres
to
any
exhibitor
of
a
film
or
distributor
of
a
book
or
whatever.
we
think
that
the
court
is
wrong
in
its
logic.
we
think
that
this
court's
opinion
in
stanley
should
be
honored
for
what
it
said.
it
said
that
it
was
limited
to
the
question
of
mere
possession.
it
did
place
its
holding
on
first
amendment
grounds
but
as
we
indicated
that
the
whole
opinion
is
rather
full
of
language.
it
speaks
in
fourth
amendment
terms.
it
speaks
about
a
concern
about
privacy
in
a
man's
home.
and
i'm
not
talking
as
appellees
suggest
about
some
protected
area.
that's
been
done
away
with
by
the
court
in
the
katz
case.
what
we're
talking
about
is
an
individual's
privacy
and
i
would
suggest
if
mr.
stanley
would
like
to
carry
an
obscene
book
down
the
street,
he
could
do
that
too
and
couldn't
be
prosecuted.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
i
don't
know
where
he
would
have
acquired
it
your
honor
and
i
don't
think
that
--
i
really
don't
think
that
it
matters
where
he
acquired
it.
i
think
the
government
has
a
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
he
could
have
obtained
that
in
a
variety
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
no
your
honor,
i'm
assuming
that
he
obtained
it
from
the
same
sort
of
source
that
other
stanley
has
obtained
similar
sorts
of
materials.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
well,
he
doesn't
have.
we
know
it's
a
practical
matter
that
stanleys
can
obtain
this
material.
the
question
is
whether
the
holding
in
stanley
reaches
so
far
as
giving
constitutional
sanction
to
the
people
that
were
distributed
and
i
would
suggest
that
it
does
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
well,
i'm
not
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
i'm
not
suggesting
that
he
doesn't
have
a
right
to
acquire
and
i'm
suggesting
that
it
doesn't
extend
so
far
as
to
hold
with
distributors
have
a
right
to
disseminate
material
contrary
to
obscenity
statutes.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
yeah,
i
don't
know
where
he
get
the
film
and
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
we
made
the
basic
right
it
seems
to
me
mr.
justice
stewart.
it's
really
a
right
not
to
be
interfered
with
by
the
government
in
this
possession
and
the
right
has
as
we
think
fourth
and
the
fifth
amendment
underpinnings
that
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that
was
a
different
fourth
amendment
(voice
overlap)
yes.
but
i
would
suggest
that
there's
a
long
quote
in
there
from
olmstead
which
was
a
fourth
amendment
case
and
there's
repeated
references
to
invasions
of
privacy
and
that's
fourth
amendment
talk
as
far
as
i
read
this
court's
case.
it
seems
to
us
that
what
the
court
should
do
in
this
area
is
to
adhere
to
the
standards
that
it
has
annunciated
in
the
past
and
instead
of
the
bold
departure
that
the
district
court
here
has
suggested,
the
district
court
suggested
that
so
long
as
material
commercially
disseminated
was
adequately
controlled,
and
by
adequately
controlled,
the
district
court
suggested
not
allowing
minors
in,
no
pandering
and
not
--
and
ensuring
that
there
was
no
intrusion
into
unwilling
or
uninterested
people.
the
district
court
suggests
that
so
long
as
that
was
done
that
commercial
distribution
of
films,
book,
whatever
would
be
constitutionally
protected.
we
think
that
that's
a
misguided
notion
because
first,
it
doesn't
give
sufficient
weight
to
the
legislative
judgment
in
this
matter.
it
has
been
a
running
debate
about
the
empirical
evidence
on
the
inducement
of
obscene
materials
to
antisocial
conduct
as
the
court
knows
as
a
presidential
commission
presently
studying
this
matter.
we
don't
know
what
they're
going
to
come
up
with.
they
are
going
to
make
a
report
in
the
middle
of
this
year.
now,
i
suggest
that
a
part
of
wisdom
would
be
to
wait
and
see
what
they'd
come
up
with.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
that
statute
requires
a
report
by
july
31st
this
year.
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
not
positive
that
they
are
going
to
make
it
by
then
but
that's
what
the
statute
required.
because
it
seems
to
us
--
this
is
so
because
where
you
end
up
if
you
accept
this
position
is
essentially
that
hardcore
pornography,
whatever
it
is,
assuming
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
assuming
you
can
know
it
when
you
see
it.
you
can't
--
it
will
be
allowed
in
and
the
kind
of
material
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
but
your
honor
as
you
know,
the
only
conclusion
if
you
accept
that
is
to
allow
everything
in
and
say
that
the
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
i
think
there
is
certainly
a
position
between
those
extremes
that
the
court
has
sought
to
carve
out
and
i
would
hope
that
would
continue
to
carve
it
out.
indeed,
it
seems
that
the
appellees
concede
that
the
district
court's
resolution
is
no
panacea.
this
is
the
so
called
assault
theory
or
nuisance
theory
of
obscenity.
somehow,
that's
going
to
get
the
court
out
of
all
these
problem
but
it
won't
get
them
out
of
all
these
problems.
it's
clear
that
it
won't
get
them
out
of
all
these
problems
because
in
the
first
place,
you're
going
to
have
to
decide
in
each
case
whether
these
three-pronged
test
has
been
complied
with
adequately
and
you're
going
to
have
to
decide
in
cases
where
the
distributor
or
the
exhibitor
determines
that
he
doesn't
have
to
comply
with
the
three-pronged
test.
you
still
are
going
to
have
to
apply
a
standard
of
obscenity.
so
it's
no
panacea
and
they
admit
that.
they
back
off
and
they
finally
say,
“well
maybe
what
you
should
do
is
draw
a
line
between
what's
concededly
obscene
and
possibly
obscene.”
we
suggest
that
that's
just
a
different
verbal
formulation
and
that
does
in
advance
the
inquiry
anywhere.
it
seems
to
us
finally
that
the
basic
problem
here
is
one
of
whether
this
court
should
seek
to
create
for
the
society.
a
society
that
is
concerned
about
morality,
whose
people
are
concerned
about
pornography,
create
a
fixed
and
inflexible
rule
that
prevents
legislatures
from
reflecting
the
will
of
the
people
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
court
shouldn't
do
that
and
it
hasn't
done
that
up
to
now
and
we
suggest
that
it's
not
appropriate
to
do
it.
so
if
the
court
reaches
the
issue
that's
presented
on
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
stanley,
we
suggest
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
overturn
the
district
court's
decision
and
restore
stanley
to
the
limited
and
original
meaning
that
we
think
the
court
had
in
mind.
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
no
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
court
--
all
the
minds
in
the
court,
the
counsel
that
have
sought
to
assist
them
have
struggled
as
i
indicated
it
with
this
problem
for
15
or
20
years
and
i
don't
suggest
there's
a
better
formulation
that
could
be
arrived
at.
i
think
it's
a
difficult
problem
and
--
mr.
roger
a.
pauley
but
the
standards
of
the
court
has
annunciated,
they
give
very
wide
range
to
free
expression
and
the
court
has
moved
really
to
a
point
where
what
is
prohibited
is
essentially
the
hardcore
sort
of
pornography.
it
doesn't
really
express
ideas
that
have
any
merit
or
any
word.
it
seems
to
us
that
that's
a
sound
and
sensible
position
and
that's
a
position
that
people
and
the
legislatures
can
live
with.
thank
you.
