mr.
edward
de
grazia
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
speak
mainly
to
the
issue
of
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
phase
and
as
it
was
applied
to
the
circumstances
of
the
exhibition
below.
before
i
do
that,
i
would
like
to
make
one
or
two
remarks
concerning
the
statements
or
questions
raised
by
the
chief
justice
and
by
mr.
justice
marshall
concerning
the
interest
of
the
exhibitor
which
is
being
--
which
was
defended
by
the
district
court
below.
it
is
not
only
his
right
to
make
money.
it
is
his
right
as
was
ably
argued
by
mr.
lewin
to
show
this
particular
film
but
more
important
was
the
right
of
all
the
people
in
boston
who
might
want
to
see
this
film
to
see
its
ideas
to
consider
its
images.
it
was
their
right
which
was
being
stifled
by
the
state
of
massachusetts.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
i
believe
he
is
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
i
believe
he
may
be
the
only
person
and
he
is
certainly
the
logical
person.
he
is
the
person
--
mr.
edward
de
grazia
he
has
the
most
direct
interest.
it's
his
skin
that's
at
stake
also.
i
think
that
booksellers
and
motion
picture
exhibitors,
they
run
a
hazardous
business
if
they're
publishing
in
the
area
--
if
they
publish
sexual
material
and
i
think
it's
up
to
this
court
to
see
that
they
get
the
measure
of
protection
they
need
for
performing
an
important
social
and
constitutional
duty.
i
don't
think
it's
fair,
i
don't
think
it's
just
to
say
that
these
people
can
run
the
risk
of
going
to
jail
for
a
year.
they
are
--
merely
because
they
may
no
be
able
to
reach
judgment
that
a
majority
of
this
court
might
reach
concerning
whether
or
not
a
particular
film
or
a
particular
book
is
obscene.
it's
an
exquisite
question.
it's
a
very
difficult
question.
i
think
it's
something
which
--
which
you
are
trying
very
hard
that
this
court,
this
honorable
court
is
trying
very
hard
to
clarify
so
that
we
will
have
a
situation
where
--
for
instance,
we'll
know
what
material
is
obscene.
for
instance,
we'll
be
unnoticed
of
what
behavior
with
respect
to
possibly
obscene
material
will
end
them
in
jail
or
will
cause
them
to
be
punished
or
will
cause
their
films
or
their
books
to
be
suppressed.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do.
i
think
that
the
direction
of
this
court
is
going
in
its
opinions
at
least
for
the
next
20
years
i
would
anticipate
that
there
will
be
material
that
will
validly
be
proscribed.
however,
i
would
like
to
say
that
i
think
the
direction
that
this
court
is
taking
and
a
proper
direction
and
a
hopeful
direction
is
to
focus
more
and
more
on
the
behavior
of
the
parties
involved
to
look
less
and
less,
to
be
concerned
less
and
less
with
the
obscenity
of
vel
non
of
material
because
obscenity
vel
non
in
fact
differs
from
person
to
person,
from
prosecutor
to
defendant,
from
judge
to
judge,
from
court
to
court,
from
state
to
state,
from
country
to
country,
from
culture
to
culture.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
edward
de
grazia
the
court
has
decided
that.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
well
i
--
this
case
doesn't
require
me
to.
oh!
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
i'm
sorry.
i
must
have
misunderstood
the
question.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
it's
clearly
enough
the
material
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
in
my
judgment,
there
is
a
state
that
may
validly
pass
--
may
pass
a
valid
statute
proscribing
and
punishing
certain
kinds
of
behavior
with
respect
to
material
which
might
--
which
might
--
can
be
called
obscene
but
it
will
be
the
behavior
focused
on
which
imparts
the
criminality
to
the
situation,
it
is
not
the
material
of
itself.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
yes,
it's
the
dissemination
of
material
which
is
involved.
yes.
well,
your
honor,
for
example
the
state
court
in
this
case
below
spread
perhaps
100
pages
--
100
pages
of
an
opinion,
trying
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
three-pronged
test
of
roth
was
met
in
this
case
and
then
in
one
sentence
found
that
their
necessary
guilty
knowledge
or
scienter
for
criminal
culpability
was
existed
and
he
found
that
in
one
sentence
despite
the
fact
that
these
exhibitors
were
knew
that
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
found
the
film
constitutionally
protected
and
could
not
possibly
imagine
that
the
film
was
obscene.
it
could
not
possibly
have
the
guilty
knowledge
that
this
film
was
obscene
or
that
their
exhibition
of
this
film
was
criminal
or
culpable.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
i
don't
think
judge
aldrich
had
any
question
in
his
mind.
i
think
that
he
chose
not
to
reach
the
question
in
order
that
he
could
reach
more
interesting
and
more
deep
--
deep-sounding
questions
concerning
the
law
of
obscenity.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
the
--
the
three-judge
court
based
its
preliminary
injunction
principally
on
the
probability
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
as
applied
to
the
circumstances
below.
the
principally
--
the
court
relied
on
the
stanley
v.georgia
opinion.
there
are
--
this
statute,
it
is
our
position
and
we
urge
you
to
consider
that
this
statute
is
overbroad
and
the
number
of
other
respects
procedurally
and
substantively
and
is
in
fact
not
only
probably
but
quite
certainly
unconstitutional.
i'd
like
to
direct
myself
to
that
question
for
a
few
minutes.
we
don't
deny
for
purposes
of
this
case
that
the
state
of
massachusetts
has
some
power
to
deal
with
social
problems
involving
alleged
obscenity,
alleged
obscene
material
but
we
insist
as
this
court
has
insisted
that
when
a
state
legislate
in
this
field
that
which
touches
on
first
amendment
freedoms
that
it
do
so
was
specificity
and
with
careful
consideration
to
the
first
amendment
freedoms
that
are
involved.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
the
state
of
massachusetts
--
mr.
edward
de
grazia
why
hasn't
the
state
of
massachusetts
done
it?
mr.
edward
de
grazia
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
edward
de
grazia
it
is
--
the
statute
is
not
specific
as
it
could
be
made.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
the
massachusetts
statute
with
respect
to
books
for
example
provides
in
rem
proceeding,
provides
a
number
of
--
a
great
number
of
procedural
constitutional
safeguards
to
protect
the
rights
of
publishers
and
book
sellers.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
the
definition
in
the
book
statute
is
no
more
precise
specific
than
the
definition
in
this
statute,
mr.
chief
--
mr.
justice
black.
that
is
true.
i
would
now
--
i
am
not
attempting
here
to
say
--
i
would
not
suggest
here
that
that
book
statute
is
constitutional.
it's
not
itself
overbroad.
i
am
suggesting,
however,
that
most
of
the
vices
contained
in
this
statute
as
it
is
being
applied
to
films
are
not
contained
in
the
boston
book,
in
the
massachusetts
book
statute.
for
example
criminal
prosecutions
are
not
brought
until
after
there
has
been
an
in
rem
proceeding
and
a
judicial
determination
of
obscenity
with
respect
to
a
particular
book.
for
example,
booksellers
are
given
the
benefit
of
any
prior
final
decision
concerning
non-obscenity
of
a
book
and
are
protected
by
an
absolute
presumption
against
the
criminal
prosecution.
for
example,
police
and
prosecutors
do
not
bring
criminal
actions
involving
books
in
massachusetts
unless
and
until
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
has
considered
the
material,
weighed
the
constitutional
issues
and
decided
whether
or
not
the
book
is
probably
obscene.
and
then
during
--
mr.
edward
de
grazia
it
doesn't
solve
the
substance
of
problem
--
mr.
edward
de
grazia
with
the
attorney
general's
action
--
mr.
edward
de
grazia
well,
i
simply
what
i
want
--
i
don't
want
to
suggest
that
if
massachusetts
enacted
a
new
statute
applicable
to
films
which
provided
precisely
with
the
massachusetts
statute
applicable
to
books
provided
that
that
would
solve
all
the
problems
but
i'm
suggesting
that
the
state
can
in
massachusetts
obviously
can
look
at
the
problem
of
freedom
of
speech
in
films
and
look
at
the
problem
of
obscenity
and
come
a
lot
closer
to
protecting
the
rights
of
the
persons
who
have
as
their
duty
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
in
trying
to
pursue
their
legitimate
state
interest
in
obscenity
--
their
interest,
their
purpose
in
protecting
--
in
protecting
the
people
of
the
state
from
obscenity.
now,
i
suggest
that
what
this
court
said
in
stanley.
what
this
court
said
in
the
redrup
are
the
legitimate
state
purposes.
i
think
that
if
the
statute
were
restricted
to
the
dangers
pointed
out
in
the
stanley
v.georgia
decision
and
in
redrup
that
is
the
dangers
of
pandering,
of
solicitation,
the
dangers
of
that
material
might
fall
into
the
hands
of
children
and
the
danger
of
obtrusive,
evasions
of
privacy
that
we
would
have
a
statute
that
people
could
operate
under
without
wholesale
violations
of
their
constitutional
rights.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
the
time
is
up.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
thank
you.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
speak
mainly
to
the
issue
of
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
phase
and
as
it
was
applied
to
the
circumstances
of
the
exhibition
below.
before
i
do
that,
i
would
like
to
make
one
or
two
remarks
concerning
the
statements
or
questions
raised
by
the
chief
justice
and
by
mr.
justice
marshall
concerning
the
interest
of
the
exhibitor
which
is
being
--
which
was
defended
by
the
district
court
below.
it
is
not
only
his
right
to
make
money.
it
is
his
right
as
was
ably
argued
by
mr.
lewin
to
show
this
particular
film
but
more
important
was
the
right
of
all
the
people
in
boston
who
might
want
to
see
this
film
to
see
its
ideas
to
consider
its
images.
it
was
their
right
which
was
being
stifled
by
the
state
of
massachusetts.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
i
believe
he
is
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
i
believe
he
may
be
the
only
person
and
he
is
certainly
the
logical
person.
he
is
the
person
--
mr.
edward
de
grazia
he
has
the
most
direct
interest.
it's
his
skin
that's
at
stake
also.
i
think
that
booksellers
and
motion
picture
exhibitors,
they
run
a
hazardous
business
if
they're
publishing
in
the
area
--
if
they
publish
sexual
material
and
i
think
it's
up
to
this
court
to
see
that
they
get
the
measure
of
protection
they
need
for
performing
an
important
social
and
constitutional
duty.
i
don't
think
it's
fair,
i
don't
think
it's
just
to
say
that
these
people
can
run
the
risk
of
going
to
jail
for
a
year.
they
are
--
merely
because
they
may
no
be
able
to
reach
judgment
that
a
majority
of
this
court
might
reach
concerning
whether
or
not
a
particular
film
or
a
particular
book
is
obscene.
it's
an
exquisite
question.
it's
a
very
difficult
question.
i
think
it's
something
which
--
which
you
are
trying
very
hard
that
this
court,
this
honorable
court
is
trying
very
hard
to
clarify
so
that
we
will
have
a
situation
where
--
for
instance,
we'll
know
what
material
is
obscene.
for

we'll
be
unnoticed
of
what
behavior
with
respect
to
possibly
obscene
material
will
end
them
in
jail
or
will
cause
them
to
be
punished
or
will
cause
their
films
or
their
books
to
be
suppressed.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do.
i
think
that
the
direction
of
this
court
is
going
in
its
opinions
at
least
for
the
next
20
years
i
would
anticipate
that
there
will
be
material
that
will
validly
be
proscribed.
however,
i
would
like
to
say
that
i
think
the
direction
that
this
court
is
taking
and
a
proper
direction
and
a
hopeful
direction
is
to
focus
more
and
more
on
the
behavior
of
the
parties
involved
to
look
less
and
less,
to
be
concerned
less
and
less
with
the
obscenity
of
vel
non
of
material
because
obscenity
vel
non
in
fact
differs
from
person
to
person,
from
prosecutor
to
defendant,
from
judge
to
judge,
from
court
to
court,
from
state
to
state,
from
country
to
country,
from
culture
to
culture.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
edward
de
grazia
the
court
has
decided
that.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
well
i
--
this
case
doesn't
require
me
to.
oh!
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
i'm
sorry.
i
must
have
misunderstood
the
question.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
it's
clearly
enough
the
material
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
in
my
judgment,
there
is
a
state
that
may
validly
pass
--
may
pass
a
valid
statute
proscribing
and
punishing
certain
kinds
of
behavior
with
respect
to
material
which
might
--
which
might
--
can
be
called
obscene
but
it
will
be
the
behavior
focused
on
which
imparts
the
criminality
to
the
situation,
it
is
not
the
material
of
itself.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
yes,
it's
the
dissemination
of
material
which
is
involved.
yes.
well,
your
honor,
for
example
the
state
court
in
this
case
below
spread
perhaps
100
pages
--
100
pages
of
an
opinion,
trying
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
three-pronged
test
of
roth
was
met
in
this
case
and
then
in
one
sentence
found
that
their
necessary
guilty
knowledge
or
scienter
for
criminal
culpability
was
existed
and
he
found
that
in
one
sentence
despite
the
fact
that
these
exhibitors
were
knew
that
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
found
the
film
constitutionally
protected
and
could
not
possibly
imagine
that
the

obscene.
it
could
not
possibly
have
the
guilty
knowledge
that
this
film
was
obscene
or
that
their
exhibition
of
this
film
was
criminal
or
culpable.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
i
don't
think
judge
aldrich
had
any
question
in
his
mind.
i
think
that
he
chose
not
to
reach
the
question
in
order
that
he
could
reach
more
interesting
and
more
deep
--
deep-sounding
questions
concerning
the
law
of
obscenity.
mr.
edward
de

the
--
the
three-judge
court
based
its
preliminary
injunction
principally
on
the
probability
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its

the

i'd
like
to
direct
myself
to
that

for
a

minutes.
we

that

mr.
edward
de

the

--
mr.
edward
de
grazia
why
hasn't
the
state
of
massachusetts
done
it?
mr.
edward
de

mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
edward
de
grazia
it
is
--
the
statute
is
not
specific
as
it
could
be
made.
mr.
edward
de

the
massachusetts
statute
with
respect
to
books
for

provides
in
rem

provides
a
number
of
--
a
great
number
of
procedural
constitutional
safeguards
to
protect
the
rights
of
publishers
and
book
sellers.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
the
definition
in
the
book
statute
is
no
more
precise
specific
than
the
definition
in
this
statute,
mr.
chief
--
mr.
justice
black.
that
is
true.
i
would
now
--
i
am
not
attempting
here
to
say
--
i
would
not
suggest
here
that
that
book
statute
is
constitutional.
it's
not
itself
overbroad.
i
am
suggesting,
however,
that
most
of
the
vices
contained
in
this
statute
as
it
is
being
applied
to
films
are
not
contained
in
the
boston
book,
in
the
massachusetts
book
statute.
for
example
criminal
prosecutions
are
not
brought
until
after
there
has
been
an
in
rem
proceeding
and
a
judicial
determination
of
obscenity
with
respect
to
a
particular
book.
for
example,
booksellers
are
given
the
benefit
of
any
prior
final
decision
concerning
non-obscenity
of
a
book
and
are
protected
by
an
absolute
presumption
against
the
criminal
prosecution.
for
example,
police
and
prosecutors
do
not
bring
criminal
actions
involving
books
in
massachusetts
unless
and
until
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
has
considered
the
material,
weighed
the
constitutional
issues
and
decided
whether
or
not
the
book
is
probably
obscene.
and
then
during
--
mr.
edward
de
grazia
it
doesn't
solve
the
substance
of
problem
--
mr.
edward
de
grazia
with
the
attorney
general's
action
--
mr.
edward
de
grazia
well,
i
simply
what
i
want
--
i
don't
want
to
suggest
that
if
massachusetts
enacted
a
new
statute
applicable
to
films
which
provided
precisely
with
the
massachusetts
statute
applicable
to
books
provided
that
that
would
solve
all
the
problems
but
i'm
suggesting
that
the
state
can
in
massachusetts
obviously
can
look
at
the
problem
of
freedom
of
speech
in
films
and
look
at
the
problem
of
obscenity
and
come
a
lot
closer
to
protecting
the
rights
of
the
persons
who
have
as
their
duty
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
in
trying
to
pursue
their
legitimate
state
interest
in
obscenity
--
their
interest,
their
purpose
in
protecting
--
in
protecting
the
people
of
the
state
from
obscenity.
now,
i
suggest
that
what
this
court
said
in
stanley.
what
this
court
said
in
the
redrup
are
the
legitimate
state
purposes.
i
think
that
if
the
statute
were
restricted
to
the
dangers
pointed
out
in
the
stanley
v.georgia
decision
and
in
redrup
that
is
the
dangers
of
pandering,
of
solicitation,
the
dangers
of
that
material
might
fall
into
the
hands
of
children
and
the
danger
of
obtrusive,
evasions
of
privacy
that
we
would
have
a
statute
that
people
could
operate
under
without
wholesale
violations
of
their
constitutional
rights.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
the
time
is
up.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
thank
you.
