mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
first
to
address
myself
to
the
question
whether
the
decision
arresting
judgment
of
conviction
was
in
fact
entered
by
the
court
below.
i
note
parenthetically
that
the
government's
brief
at
pages
7
and
8
states,
“appellees
motion
which
the
trial
judge
granted
purported
to
be
in
and
was
treated
by
the
district
court
as
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
this
--
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
submitted
in
accordance
with
the
times
spelled
out
in
rule
34
or
the
making
of
such
motions
after
the
jury's
verdict
of
guilty.
a
ground
on
which
the
motion
rested
but
the
indictment
did
not
charge
an
offense
similarly
fell
within
the
traditional
scope
of
such
motions
is
expressly
recognized
in
rule
34.
i
have
assumed
for
proposes
of
my
brief
an
argument
before
this
court
today,
that
the
government
agreed
with
our
position
that
what
the
judge
in
fact
granted
was
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment.
i
think
that
assumption
is
supported
by
the
record.
on
the
date
when
the
verdict
of
guilty
was
rendered
by
the
jury,
the
judge
said,
this
appears
at
page
197
of
the
record.
he
said
march
31st
as
the
date
for
sentencing
that
is,
“had
no
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
then
filed
and
there
was
no
guarantee
at
any
such
motion
would
be
filed
by
sisson
in
this
case.
sentencing
would
have
occurred
on
march
31st.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i
think
rule
34
expressly
limits
the
time
within
which
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
can
be
made.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
it
will
carry
the
10
days
following
the
verdict
guilty
or
within
such
further
time
as
the
court
allow
us.
but
as
of
the
date
of
the
jury's
verdict,
there
were
10
days
within
which
the
motion
could
be
filed.
if
no
such
motion
was
filed
on
march
31st,
the
expiration
of
the
10-day
period
sentencing
was
to
occur.
moreover,
the
docket
in
the
case
is
reproduced
at
the
beginning
of
the
record
on
appeal
at
pages
3,
and
4,
and
5
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
an
indication
spelling
out
the
judgment
the
decision
of
the
district
court
as
follows.
the
defendant
with
his
counsel
and
government
counsel
present,
the
court
reads
its
opinion
granting
defendants
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
pursuing
to
rule
34
by
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
excerpts
quoted
below,
“in
the
words
of
rule
34
the
indictment
of
sisson
does
not
charge
an
offense.”
this
court's
decision
arresting
a
judgment
of
conviction
for
inefficiency
of
the
indictment
is
based
upon
the
invalidity
of
the
statute
upon
which
the
indictment
is
founded
within
the
meaning
of
those
phrases
as
used
in
18
u.s.c.
section
3731.
then,
the
century
in
the
docket
continues
and
concludes
court
orders
this
decision
and
this
court's
order
granting
defendants
sisson's
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
enter
forthwith.
on
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
statute
in
conferring
jurisdiction
upon
this
court
on
appeal,
on
direct
appeal
from
judgments
of
the
district
court,
granting
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment.
we
concur
with
the
position
of
the
government
that
indeed
this
court
does
have
jurisdiction
under
the
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
provision
of
section
3731
of
the
criminal
appeals
act.
in
addition,
it
is
our
position
that
the
government
saw
an
argument
with
respect
to
the
other
two
clauses
the
plea
in
bar,
as
well
as
leave
motion
dismissing
an
indictment.
really,
really
is
quite
persuasive
that
the
intent
of
the
draftsmen
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
was
precisely
to
confer
upon
this
court
jurisdiction
in
all
cases
which
were
not
precluded
by
the
constitution
by
reason
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
now,
i
have
in
mind
for
instance
and
i'm
simply
selecting
randomly
on
page
22
of
the
government's
brief.
there
is
a
quotation
from
senator
bacon,
which
he
indicates
that,
“the
jeopardy
clause
was
inserted
in
the
motion
in
bar
subdivision
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution.”
the
caution,
i
suggest
to
the
court
in
context
were
simply
that
they
wanted
to
be
quite
clear
that
they
were
not
purporting
to
grand
jurisdiction
in
cases
which
are
constitutionally
proscribe.
now,
as
a
reference
to
the
purpose
which
the
statute
was
intended
to
serve
on
that
same
page,
page
22
of
the
brief.
the
purpose
was
simply
to
meet
the
problem
of
having
district
court
judge's
dismissing
criminal
prosecutions.
in
particular
there
was
a
case
against
--
cherry
meat
packers.
the
court
dismissed
the
proceedings
and
the
government
was
powerless
to
do
anything
about
it.
and
congress
wanted
to
ensure
that
that
sort
of
a
result
simply
could
not
have
it.
it
wanted
to
provide
review
in
this
court
to
ensure
that
those
sorts
of
decisions
would
be
reviewed
by
the
court
and
i
don't
think
there's
a
shred
of
evidence
which
indicates
that
the
congress
intended
by
providing
various
loopholes
to
make
it
possible
by
supposedly,
well,
a
district
judge
bent
on
circumventing
the
appeals
provision
of
the
criminal
appeals
act.
to
simply
avoid
this
result
namely
of
providing
review
in
this
court
by
for
instance
permitting,
well
the
procedure
which
was
followed
in
this
case.
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
present
cases
the
prototype
of
the
situation,
which
the
draftsmen
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
could
not
possibly
have
intended
to
result
in
precluding
review
by
this
court.
that
is
simply
would
be
much
too
easy
to
circumvent
the
purpose
of
the
draftsmen
of
the
act.
now
on
page
23,
senator
nelson
expressly
says
again
i'm
quoting
the
quotation,
elsewhere
said
that,
“the
plain
bar
section,
it
was
made
clear
out
of
the
extreme
caution
that
where
the
defendant
has
been
put
in
jeopardy,
he
cannot
be
reindicted.”
the
emphasis
again
was
on
the
question
whether
the
defendant
having
filed
whatever
motions
been
filed.
having
that
motion
granted
by
the
court
whether
he
could
be
reindicted
and
i
don't
think,
there's
any
question
or
is
there
any
suggestion
by
the
government
that
in
circumstances
where
a
defendant
files
a
motion
in
bar
or
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
that
he
could
in
fact
be
reindicted
if
the
motion
were
granted
in
subsequently
that
decision
were
vacated.
now,
the
government
at
page
25
quotes
justice
holmes
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
macdonald
and
indeed,
justice
holmes
refers
to
judgments
rendered
before
the
moment
of
jeopardy
is
reach.
what
is
omitted
immediately
succeeding
the
quotation
that
is
the
text
includes
a
citation
to
the
decision
in
kepner
against
united
states
at
195
u.s.
and
in
that
decision
justice
holmes
we
quote
from
him
in
our
brief,
they
declare
that
he
consider
the
double
jeopardy
question
to
be
a
very
limited
one.
that
is
he
pointed
out
there
are
numerous
circumstances
in
which
a
man
can
be
retried
after
having
once
been
tried
and
found
guilty
by
a
jury
without
contravening
the
double
jeopardy
safeguard
in
the
constitution.
it
won't
leave
where
the
point
anymore,
i
would
like
again
to
refer
to
the
testimony
of
senator
knox
which
is
quoted
at
pages
26
and
27
of
the
government's
brief
in
which
senator
knox
refers
to
all
of
the
motions
that
is
the
merit
to
the
indictment,
the
motion
to
quash
or
set
aside
the
indictment,
motion
and
arrest
of
judgment
and
in
judgment
sustaining
defendant's
plea
in
bar.
and
he
refers
to
all
of
these
motions,
as
motions
the
effect
of
which
is
to
defeat
jeopardy.
i
believe
that's
accurate
in
glossing
of
what
is
--
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
if
the
judgment
is
affirmed?
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
i
believe
that
the
conviction
is
set
aside.
that
is
the
judgment
of
the
court
is
--
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
right.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
the
judgment
is
arrested,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
right
and
--
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
well
--
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
so
far
as
we're
concerned,
your
honor,
quite
frankly,
i'm
not
prepared
to
respond
to
that.
i
haven't
thought
of
the
problem
but
i
will
represent
that
will
be
satisfied
with
--
when
were
judgment
in
this
court
saying
affirmed,
i
think,
we
can
deal
with
the
problem
once
--
once
that
action
is
taken.
i
would
--
by
way
of
context,
there
just
isn't
enough
time
remaining
today
to
deal
with
all
of
the
issues
particularly
the
first
amendment
issues,
selective
objective
question.
i
would
like
to
refer,
if
i
may,
to
some
of
the
statement
made
by
solicitor
general
griswold
because
i
consider
that
some
of
the
difficulties
in
hearing
in
this
case
arise
from
assumptions
made
by
the
solicitor
general,
which
are
not
dealt
with
it
at
all
in
either
of
the
briefs.
that
is
--
the
assumptions
for
instance
is
that
when
congress
acts
that
somehow
there
is
a
presumption
which
arises
from
the
action
of
congress,
which
is
sufficient
to
simply
overcome
whatever
claims
an
individual
might
make.
we're
certainly
not
challenging
our
system
of
government
in
this
case.
we're
not
challenging
democracy
or
majority
rule.
we're
not
requesting
that
this
court
imposed
its
judgments
and
substitute
it
for
the
judgment
of
the
legislature
of
congress.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
the
issue
presented
before
this
court
is
limited
solely
to
the
question
or
the
man
can
be
deprived
of
his
liberty
and
compelled
to
kill
conceivably.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
that's
true.
that's
true
he
might.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
but
initially
--
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
right.
initially
at
the
very
least,
we're
only
certain
that
he
was
to
be
deprived
of
his
liberty.
i
would
submit
that
that's
efficient
for
purposes
of
distinguishing
this
case
from
a
tax
case.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
it
is
--
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i
think
at
this
point,
we
do.
that
is,
with
--
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
speculate
about
where
he
might
have
been
sent,
that
is
we
have
statistics
showing
that
he
had
two
out
of
three
chances
of
being
sent
to
vietnam
at
least.
but
what
happened
was
that
he
refused
to
submit
to
induction
and
he
refused
to
submit
to
obey
an
order
which
was
issued
to
him.
and
the
government
asserts
in
various
places
that
whether
this
conduct
is
criminal
or
not
depends
on
the
validity
of
the
order.
now,
we
assert
that
the
order
as
such,
which
precedes
any
assignment
of
the
conscript
to
any
field
of
duty
whether
to
paris
or
vietnam,
or
any
other
locations.
we
assert
that
that
order
was
in
it
of
itself
invalid
for
variety
of
reasons.
i
would
in
the
time
remaining
this
afternoon,
simply
like
to
address
myself
to
two
points.
one
will
be
in
passing.
i'll
refer
to
recent
book
written
by
a
man
named
raoul
berger
entitled
“congress
against
the
supreme
court”
in
which
the
point
is
made
i
think
quite
convincingly.
the
judicial
review
in
this
court
is
not
a
matter
of
user
patient
by
this
court
but
was
something
intended
very
definitely
by
the
framers
of
the
constitution,
precisely
to
provide
a
safeguard
against
the
encroachment
of
individual
liberty
by
congress.
i
would
only
like
to
refer
to
two
quotations;
one
is
from
page
31
of
this
book
its
a
1969
book
by
jefferson.
jefferson
in
1781
stated,
“that
173
despots
would
surely
be
as
oppressive
as
one
and
elective
despotism
was
not
the
government
we
fought
for.”
similarly,
madison
in
dealing
with
the
purpose
of
the
bill
of
rights
stated,
“these
amendments
are
incorporated
into
the
constitution,
independent,
tribunals
of
justice
will
consider
themselves
in
a
peculiar
manner
the
guardians
of
those
rights.
it
will
be
and
impenetrable
ball
work
against
every
assumption
of
power
in
the
legislative
or
executive.
now,
the
notion
that
the
federal
congress
might
arrogate
to
itself,
powers
and
infringing
individual
liberty
was
something
of
which
the
framers
was
--
were
very,
very
conscious.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
they
were
concerned
principally
about
congress,
the
federal
congress.
they
were
not
particularly
concern
about
state
legislatures.
they
have
faith
in
their
state
legislators.
they
knew
but
they
knew
nothing
whatsoever
about
this
new
organ.
this
federal
legislature
that
was
to
sit
at
times
1,000
miles
away
from
some
parts
of
this
vast
land.
and
the
people
were
afraid
that
precisely
the
federal
government
would
reach
out
and
deprive
them
of
fundamental
liberties.
for
this
purpose,
this
court
was
vested
with
judicial
review
with
the
power
of
deciding
where
the
congress
has
exceeded
the
limits
of
its
power,
of
the
limited
delegated
powers
conferred
by
the
constitution.
this
doctrine
was
asserted
repeatedly
throughout
the
time
of
the
ratification
of
framing
of
the
constitution
that
is
set
on
the
verdict
book.
it
was
reiterated
by
this
court
in
luther
against
borden
in
the
middle
of
19th
century.
the
only
other
point,
i
wish
to
make
is
the
repeated
insistence
by
the
solicitor
general
to
history
that
on
the
basis
of
the
history
surrounding
the
adoption
of
the
bill
of
rights.
there
is
no
basis
for
this
court
concluding
that
religion
is
coextensive
with
the
rights
of
conscience.
i
submit
and
i
do
it
diffidently
i
was
one
of
the
students
and
this
is
a
great
man,
vast
knowledge
of
taxation
certainly
but
i
respectfully
suggest
that
his
knowledge
--
the
scope
of
the
religion
protection
is
not
accurate,
it's
simply
is
not
accurate.
i
refer
for
instance
to
the
part
of
our
brief
at
pages
97
through
102.
in
particular,
i
have
reference
to
ratification
statements,
free
ratification
statements,
that
is
before
the
bill
of
rights
was
in
existence,
that
is
i
posit
it
to
this
court
the
situation
where
there
is
no
bill
of
rights
where
there
is
not
first
amendment
to
be
construed.
and
i
ask
this
court
whether
in
that
circumstance
this
court
could
reach
the
conclusion
that
religion
does
not
extend
to
the
right
of
conscience
or
that
the
constitution
was
intended
to
deprive
individuals
of
the
protection
of
religion,
the
free
exercise
of
religion.
i
refer
in
particular
to
declarations
of
rights
made
by
the
conventions
of
new
york,
rhode
island,
north
carolina,
and
virginia.
these
declarations
assert
the
existence
of
certain
inalienable
rights
and
make
it
very
clear
that
the
constitution
was
being
ratified
only
with
the
expressed
understanding
that
these
rights
were
not
infringed
by
the
constitution.
that
was
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
bill
of
rights.
one
of
these
rights
was,
“that
the
people
have
an
equal
and
natural
and
an
alienable
right
freely
and
peaceably
to
exercise
their
religion
according
to
the
dictates
of
their
conscience
and
that
no
religious
sect
or
society
ought
to
be
favored
or
established
by
law
in
preference
of
others.”
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
it
gets
into
this
case
in
this
way
your
honor.
the
argument
of
the
government
relies
on
the
proposition
that
somehow
the
word
religion
has
grown
beyond
its
intended
scope.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
on
a
constitutional
basis,
we
always
have.
that
is
it
isn't
--
isn't
an
inaccurate
statement
to
describe
sisson
as
a
selective
nonreligious
objector.
he
is
a
selective
nonreligious
conscientious
objector
and
the
very
necessity
for
making
that
distinction
between
the
religious
objector
or
rather
nonreligious
objecting
--
nonreligious
conscientious
objector
is
the
fact
that
the
act,
as
the
solicitor
general
so
eagerly
defended
it,
makes
that
distinction.
it
does
not
extend
the
scope
of
the
exemption
in
the
act
to
the
full
measure
of
protection
and
afforded
to
religion
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
we
left
off
suggesting
that
if
there
were
no
bill
of
rights
at
all,
this
court
would
nonetheless
be
required
by
the
constitution
as
adopted
by
the
framers,
by
the
state
ratifying
conventions
as
they
understood
the
constitution
would
require
this
court
nonetheless
to
protect
the
individual
rights
of
citizens
–
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
on
page
98
through
99
of
our
brief
-–
i'm
sorry,
it's
page
100
through
101.
we
quote
from
a
statement
made
by
the
rhode
island
ratifying
convention,
which
is
virtually
identical,
i
think
there
are
very
minor
changes
in
language
that
is
almost
identical
to
the
statements
made
by
the
north
carolina
and
virginia
ratifying
conventions,
i'm
sorry.
and
the
statement
states,
that
is
that's
just
a
very
small
portion
of
the
statement
made
by
the
ratifying
convention.
the
ratifying
convention
said
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
by
the
ratifying
convention
of
the
state
of
rhode
island,
your
honor,
almost
identical
to
the
statement
made
by
the
ratifying
convention
of
the
state
of
north
carolina,
as
well
as
the
state
of
virginia.
these
statements
expressly
asserted
that
ratification
of
the
constitution
was
based
on
an
expressed
understanding
that
it
did
not
infringe
unalienable
rights
of
individual
citizens.
the
fourth
paragraph,
the
fourth
proposition
stated
in
that
ratifying
statement
is
that
religion
or
the
duty
which
we
owe
to
our
creator
in
the
manner
of
discharging
it
can
be
directed
only
by
reason
and
conviction
and
not
by
force
or
violence.
and
therefore,
all
men
have
an
equal,
natural
and
inalienable
right
to
the
free
exercise
of
religion
according
to
the
dictates
of
conscience
and
that
no
particular
religious
sect
or
society
ought
to
be
favored
or
established
by
law
in
preference
to
others.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
100
through
101,
your
honor,
the
bottom
of
100
through
the
top
of
101.
that
statement
is
virtually
identical
to
the
statement
made
from
the
ratifying
convention
of
the
state
of
new
york.
i
accorded
that
at
the
end
of
the
argument
yesterday.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
very
late,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i'm
not
sure,
but
i
think
among
the
four
states
represented
in
these
statements,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
there
would
have
been
no
ratification
of
the
constitution
but
for
the
expressed
understanding
that
these
rights
were
safeguarded.
that
is,
there
was
no
need
for
the
bill
of
rights
to
protect
religion
as
understood
by
the
persons
who
drafted
and
who
ratified
the
constitution.
it's
true
that
a
bill
of
rights
were
subsequently
enacted
but
madison
explained,
and
that's
quoted
at
the
bottom
of
98
through
top
of
99,
“although
i
know
whenever
the
great
rights,
the
trial
by
jury,
freedom
of
the
press,
of
liberty
of
conscience
come
in
question
in
that
body,
the
invasion
of
them
is
resisted
by
able
advocates.
yet,
their
magna
carta
does
not
contain
any
one
provision
for
the
security
of
those
rights
respecting
which
the
people
of
america
are
most
alarmed.”
the
freedom
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
i
have
–-
these
are
just
random
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
that's
a
separate
question,
your
honor.
it
certainly
is
related
and
that's
why
i
mentioned
it
at
this
point,
but
i'm
simply
addressing
myself
now
to
the
assertion
made
by
the
government
that
religion
does
not
mean
conscience.
and
i
think
that's
clearly
wrong
from
the
standpoint
of
history.
i
can
understand
the
government's
inclination
so
to
construe
the
protection
of
religion
in
the
bill
of
rights.
i
understand
why
they
would
like
to
limit
it,
but
it's
just
flatly
inaccurate
as
a
matter
of
history.
that's
just
not
what
they
understood
180
years
ago.
what
we're
calling
for
is
not
something
which
would
destroy
orderly
government
at
all.
obviously,
what
would
be
most
destructive
of
orderly
government
would
be
if
the
constitution
were
ignored,
and
we
want
the
constitution
enforced.
that
is,
the
constitution
says
certain
things
about
what
powers
congress
have,
and
i
will
come
very
quickly
to
that
central
question.
that
is,
what
power
did
congress
receive
through
the
constitution
to
draft
individuals,
whether
in
peace
or
in
order.
that's
the
central
issue.
obviously,
if
the
constitution
did
not
delegate
this
power
to
congress,
congress
doesn't
have
it.
even
if
congress
would
like
to
have
it,
even
if
congress
thinks
that
it
is
absolutely
indispensable
in
its
judgment
to
have
that
power,
if
that
power
was
not
conferred
by
the
constitution,
it's
perfectly
plain
they
don't
have
the
power.
the
constitution
sets
the
limits
of
the
power
that
were
in
fact
conferred
to
congress.
now,
i'm
simply
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
that
is
not
our
proposition,
your
honor.
that
is
–-
i
think
there's
a
very
important
distinction
between
a
man
who
acts
on
the
basis
of
conscience
that
is
who
simply
can't
obey
the
order.
that's
on
that
system.
and
a
man
who
thinks,
well,
it'd
be
a
bad
policy
to
follow,
to
go
fight
a
war
in
vietnam
--
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor,
but
that's
a
very
customary
function
in
law,
that
is
we're
constantly
–-
the
courts,
that
is
–-
are
constantly
about
the
business
of
establishing
where
the
man
intended
to
do
something
around
it,
but
just
don't
know
how
to
avoid
that.
but
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i
think
so,
your
honor.
but
is
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
in
a
sense,
that's
true,
but
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
that's
the
military
service.
that
is,
he
disobeyed
an
order.
he
disobeyed
that
order
on
the
basis
of
his
conviction
that
the
order
was
invalid.
now
at
this
point,
i
really
don't
think
that
the
question
is
whether
his
subjective
belief
was
well
founded.
at
least
the
threshold
question
is
whether
from
an
objective
point
of
view,
he
was
right,
whether
the
order
was
valid.
did
congress
in
fact
have
the
power
to
issue
the
order
to
this
man
that
he
report
for
induction
because
if
congress
had
no
such
power,
simply
to
induct
him
into
the
army,
then
refusal
to
obey
the
order
simply
is
not
a
criminal
act.
and
that's
independent
of
what
he
may
have
believed
to
doubt
the
vietnam
war
or
may
not
have
believed.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i
think
so,
your
honor.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
from
the
outset,
the
motion
is
filed,
the
pre-trial
motion
is
filed
in
this
case
squarely
raised
and
the
government
has
so
recognized
–-
squarely
raised
that
the
initial
question
raised
by
the
appellee
was
simply
the
power
of
congress
to
issue
that
order
to
him,
and
he
said
no,
congress
does
not
have
that
power.
that
is,
if
he
had
said
nothing
about
his
beliefs.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
i
think,
your
honor.
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question
that
there's
on
the
issues
which
were
properly
raised
one
issue,
very
definitely
is
the
issue
which
the
district
judge
in
fact
based
his
decision
upon.
that
is,
the
right
of
johny
sisson
to
exercise
freely
his
religion
under
the
first
amendment.
or
alternatively,
the
question,
the
issue
whether
the
selective
service
act
of
1967
constitutes
an
establishment
of
religion.
but
that
--
those
were
just
two
of
the
issues
raised.
we
repeatedly
reasserted
and
reasserted
again
in
the
motion
in
the
rest
of
judgment.
the
threshold
question
obviously
has
to
be
whether
the
order
issued
to
johny
sisson
was
invalid.
it
might
have
been
invalid
for
a
number
of
technical
reasons.
now,
those
technical
reasons
–-
technical
deficiencies
in
the
order
did
not
appear
at
the
trial.
if
such
deficiencies
had
appeared
in
fact,
the
case
would
not
be
here,
certainly
not
on
direct
appeal.
that
is,
the
only
questions
presently
being
raised
are
questions
bearing
on
the
validity,
constitutionality
of
that
order.
and
the
point
we
repeatedly
stressed
is
that
congress
just
does
not
have
power
to
conscript
sisson
now.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
the
particular
reason,
your
honor,
is
that
congress
is
powered
to
raise
and
support
arguments,
which
is
the
clause
on
which
the
government
relies
squarely,
does
not
extend
–-
it
is
not
an
unlimited
power.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
it
is
limited
first
of
all
to
circumstances
where
an
emergency
exists.
i
know
that
that's
somewhat
vague,
but
i
think
by
looking
at
the
historical
interpretation
of
congress'
power,
we
can
derive
very
definite
meaning
as
to
what
the
framers
of
the
constitution
understood,
what
members
of
the
first
congress
understood
by
the
power
to
raise
and
support
arguments.
now
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i
think
the
most
solid
point
we
have
is
the
point
that
congress
has
no
power
to
draft
in
an
emergency,
which
usually
will
mean
the
same
thing
as
no
power
to
draft
absent
to
declaration
of
war.
but
the
reason
i
think
i
don't
–-
we
do
not
assert
that
in
that
form,
that
is
that
congress
can't
conscript
unless
there's
been
a
declaration
of
war,
is
that
we
concede
that
in
a
number
of
the
emergencies,
even
if
there
were
no
declaration
of
war,
congress
would
have
the
power
to
conscript
because
i
just
don't
believe
that
congress
is
powerless
to
defend
this
country.
this
country
must
have
the
power
to
survive.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
i'm
not
saying
that
either,
your
honor,
but
i
am
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
that's
right.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes.
one
example
of
an
emergency,
your
honor,
would
be
the
civil
war.
that
is
civil
war
was
not
a
declared
war.
it
was
an
insurrection
and
indeed,
congress
did
adopt
the
conscription
act.
we're
not
challenging
the
power
of
congress
to
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
we're
saying
that
this
war
in
the
present
circumstances
just
doesn't
amount
to
the
kind
of
emergency
that
must
have
been
contemplated
by
the
draftsmen
of
the
constitution.
that
is
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor.
certainly,
the
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor.
time
of
peace
again
is
somewhat
misleading
because
that
may
be
thought
to
mean
the
absence
of
a
declaration
of
war.
but
i
think
what
is
at
issue
is
the
existence
of
an
emergency
that
it
makes
it
very,
very
clear
that
congress
has
no
choice,
that
it
must
conscript
because
if
it
doesn't
conscript
for
a
national
security
is
in
a
very
mediate
sense
at
stake.
i
don't
think
there's
much
ambiguity
about
what
the
power
of
congress
is
meant
for
the
first
150
years
of
the
existence
of
this
country.
that
is,
peace
time
conscription
as
we
know
it
is
very,
very
recent
in
time,
just
–-
it
didn't
take
years.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
oh
definitely,
your
honor.
but
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
definitely
not,
no.
i
just
don't
think
they
have
that
power.
that
is,
if
that
had
been
even
remotely
suggested
at
the
time
that
the
constitution
was
ratified,
absolutely
no
question
but
that
that
the
constitution
would
not
have
been
ratified.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i'll
try,
your
honor.
there
are
several
steps
to
our
argument.
we
begin
with
a
broader
story
argument
and
with
a
relatively
narrow
argument
based
on
johnny
sisson.
first
argument
is
whether
congress
has
the
power
to
draft
anybody
at
this
time.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
no,
or
–-
no.
that
has
been
suggested
two
or
three
times.
i
hope
i
can
make
it
very
clear
that
that's
not
what
we
mean
at
all.
that
is,
if
congress
has
the
power
to
draft
people
in
general,
then
the
argument
which
we
are
now
making
is
not
relevant
at
all.
it
would
remain
a
subsequent,
a
different
question.
that
is,
assuming
that
congress
has
the
power
to
draft
the
generality
of
men
at
this
time,
are
they
nonetheless
restricted
by
the
individual
right
of
conscience,
the
right
to
free
exercise
of
religion,
so
that
they
can't
conscript
certain
classes
of
men.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
oh
no,
i
don't
think
that
that
follows
at
all.
you
might
disagree
on
political
grounds,
on
economic
grounds,
sociological
grounds.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
all
i
can
say,
your
honor,
is
again,
i'd
like
to
quote
madison
and
–-
well,
it
was
about
the
time
of
the
–-
he
was
at
that
time
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
your
honor
-–
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
your
honor,
it
is
a
difficult
problem.
the
judicial
system
is
full
of
very,
very
difficult
problems.
probably
no
more
important
questions
arise
and
when
the
individual's
rights
are
pitted
against
the
government's
power
and
--
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
--
it
is
this
court,
which
is
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
that
is
not
the
question
at
this
point,
your
honor.
if
you
would
please
–-
the
question
is
not
where
he
would
be
assigned
right
now.
the
question
of
the
power
of
the
congress
to
--
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
whether
he
wants
to
or
not
-–
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
--
whether
he
wants
to
or
not
is
not
the
issue,
not
the
issue.
he
might
want
to,
and
nonetheless
his
refusal
might
be
justified
if
there
was
no
power
to
issue
that
order.
the
threshold
question
is
whether
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
that's
exactly
what
we
say,
not
just
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
no,
no,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
your
honor,
it
got
into
this
case
because
we
raised
it
and
we
stressed
it
at
every
point.
this
is
not
a
new
point
on
appeal
at
all.
and
this
elicit
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
that
is
--
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
i
think
this
court
is
charged
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
--
yes.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
that
is,
there
are
a
number
of
grounds
which
we
assert.
but
i
would,
simply
as
the
last
comment
to
mr.
justice
marshall's
remark
with
respect
to
the
difficulty
of
ascertaining,
the
meaning
of
conscience
indicate
that
the
draftsmen
of
the
constitution
had
no
problem
with
that.
that
is,
i
quote
from
madison,
“the
freedom
of
the
press
and
rights
of
conscience,
those
choices,
privileges
of
the
people
are
unguarded
in
the
british
constitution”.
he
had
no
question,
but
that
if
there
were
no
bill
of
rights,
a
man's
right
of
conscience
would
nonetheless
be
protected.
he
didn't
need
a
bill
of
rights.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
precisely
the
argument
which
the
government
now
makes
was
the
argument
feared
back
then.
that
if
you
provided
a
bill
of
rights
then,
somebody
would
say,
“well,
that's
all
you
have.”
nothing
else
is
protected,
but
the
ninth
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i
missed
that,
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
no,
we
are
not.
we
made
several
arguments
and
we
maintain
them
all.
that
is,
generally
speaking,
there
are
two
arguments
and
the
first
argument
is
what
power
does
congress
have
under
the
clause
which
empowers
it
to
raise
and
support
armies,
independently
of
the
first
amendment.
the
second
argument
is
whether
that
power
is
in
some
specifically
–-
a
specific
way
limited
by
the
first
amendment.
i
am
not
addressing
myself
solely
to
the
first
question,
forgetting
about
the
bill
of
rights
altogether,
what
power
did
the
constitution
confer
upon
congress
to
raise
and
support
armies?
i
do
suggest
respectfully
that
the
history
of
the
ratification
of
the
constitution,
of
the
dates
at
the
constitutional
convention
simply
do
not
blame
themselves
to
any
interpretation
which
would
suggest
that
back
then,
it
was
thought
that
the
federal
government
-–
congress
could
simply
reach
out
and
pluck
people
out
for
universal
military
service.
that
--
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
in
time
of
national
emergency,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well
certainly,
the
congress.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
but
congress
defines
it
for
legislative
purposes.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
oh
no,
no.
if
all
he
asserted,
that's
a
perfect
example
to
distinguish
the
two
arguments.
that
is
if
–-
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
precise
-–
that
sort
of
-–
that
sort
of
argument
has
a
parallel
with
what
happened
during
the
war
of
1812.
that
is,
the
president
issued
quotas
the
governors
of
various
states,
and
the
war
was
thought
to
be
an
unconstitutional
war
by
many
governors,
particularly
in
new
england.
they
simply
refused
to
obey
that
order.
and
so
we're
not
going
to
supply
you
militia.
now,
furthermore,
some
of
the
militia
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
the
president
at
that
time,
your
honor,
was
madison.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor.
the
man
who
acted
not
under
the
power
to
raise
and
support
armies,
but
rather
under
the
militia
clauses
of
article
12
–-
of
article
1,
that
is,
the
constitution
provides
a
very,
very
plain
scheme,
provides
for
standing
armies.
those
were
very,
very,
very
much
feared.
in
addition
to
standing
armies
for
instance,
the
garrison,
the
frontier
posts
against
the
possibility
of
hostilities
with
the
invasions.
the
constitution
says
well,
if
you
have
an
insurrection
or
if
you
have
an
invasion,
or
if
you
have
a
problem
with
executing
the
laws,
you
can
call
out
the
state
militias.
the
calling
of
the
state
militias
meant
something
very
specific.
it
meant
you
could
only
call
them
for
three
months,
in
any
one
year.
you
could
only
call
them
in
rotation
so
that
if
you
called
them
in
once,
you
couldn't
call
them
again
until
every
other
able
bodied
man,
and
his
battalion
had
been
called.
furthermore,
you
didn't
call
them
for
a
specific
length
of
time.
you
just
called
them
out
for
that
particular
purpose.
if
you
had
a
problem
with
the
unions
in
one
location,
you
call
out
the
militia
and
they
dealt
with
the
unions
there
and
then
they
went
back
home
to
their
jobs,
farmers,
various
other
jobs
which
they
are
in.
that
was
the
scheme
which
the
constitution
provided.
that
is
that's
the
way
in
which
congress
was
to
deal
with
problems
of
national
defense.
we
are
conceding
that
in
addition
to
what
is
clearly
provided,
in
a
clear
case
of
national
emergency
where
the
national
survival
is
at
stake,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
congress
must
have
the
power
to
mobilize
every
resource.
and
certainly,
that
was
contemplated,
it
is
not
denied.
in
the
constitution
therefore,
we
don't
deny
that
it
must
exist
by
inference.
but
when
we
read
the
historical
record
without
which
that
was
simply
cannot
be
read,
that
is
you
just
can't
raise
and
support
armies
literally
unless
you
understand
what
they
meant
by
a
raise
and
support
armies.
now,
we
deal
with
the
historical
argument
at
length
in
our
brief.
i
think
we
demonstrate
very
clearly
that
the
power
to
conscript
was
feared.
it
was
not
even
used
in
the
revolutionary
war
except
in
very
limited
circumstances.
at
the
height
–-
at
the
height
of
the
idealism
which
motivated
the
men
who
were
fighting
for
their
freedom
of
this
country.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
we
would
have
a
very,
very
different
case,
your
honor,
but
that
is
precisely
what
we
have
in
mind.
that
is,
the
declaration
of
war
is
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but
that
would
be
one
very
clear
example
of
a
declaration
of
a
national
emergency.
it's
one
thing
to
say
we
really
need
to
do
this.
it's
quite
another
matter
to
enact
the
statute
which
is
designed
not
simply
to
meet
with
national
emergencies
but
to
deal
with
peace
time
conditions
and
to
apply
it
in
peace
time
rather
than
limiting
its
application
to
war
time
conditions,
or
national
emergency
conditions.
but
it
just
–-
it
just
was
beyond
anything
that
any
of
advancement
or
any
of
the
people
at
the
time
that
the
constitution
was
adopted
that
this
federal
government,
this
body
of
people
could
simply
reach
out
and
conscript
people.
if
they
can
do
it
now,
why
couldn't
they
have
done
it
back
then?
why
couldn't
they
simply
conscript
one
million
men?
we're
going
to
have
a
standing
army
of
one
million
men.
furthermore,
we're
going
to
induct
them,
we're
going
to
conscript
them
for
ten
years
because
we
think
we
ought
to
have
a
very
strong
army.
yet
it
just
is
inconceivable
that
that
power
was
granted.
it
just
was
not
granted.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
not
against
the
standing
army,
your
honor.
the
standing
army
composed
of
volunteers
is
precisely
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
of
conscripts,
yes,
your
honor.
during
the
first
150
years
of
the
history
of
this
country,
that's
precisely
what
congress
did
continuously.
it
resorted
to
volunteers,
not
for
various
reasons
of
social
policy.
congress
has
decided.
well,
we
don't
like
that
scheme.
that
is,
if
what
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
that's
correct,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
we
concede
there
is
power
to
conscript
when
you
have
a
genuine
national
emergency.
there
just
was
no
power
to
which
was
conferred.
to
raise
a
standing
army
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor.
you
can
determine
it
in
many,
many
ways.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
the
final
arbitrar
with
respect
to
the
limits
of
power
which
congress
has.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
always
this
court,
that
is.
i
don't
think
it's
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i
think
ultimately,
this
court
must
decide
any
argument
that
congress
has
exceeded
the
limits
of
its
power.
but
certainly,
action
taken
by
congress,
unequivocal
action
declaring
the
existence
of
an
emergency
would
be
very
persuasive,
not
necessarily
conclusive
but
i
think
we
–-
we
would
have
very,
very
little
hope
of
prevailing
if
congress
had
said
well,
we've
got
a
national
emergency
and
we
absolutely
need
to
conscript
men.
but
we
don't
have
that
situation
at
all.
for
the
last
six
years,
there've
been
studies
upon
studies
as
to
whether
volunteer
army
was
feasible,
clearly
testified
time
and
time
again
both
by
government
persons
who
opposed
a
no-volunteer
army
as
well
as
by
men
who
preferred
the
volunteer
army
that
it
is
feasible.
i
mean,
manpower
is
available.
it
just
costs
money.
but
that's
the
way
in
which
a
standing
army
has
been
raised
for
150
years.
and
it
was
never
suggested
that
congress
could
simply
say,
“well,
we
don't
think
we
ought
to
be
spending
money
this
way.
we're
not
going
to
do
it.
we'll
save
the
little
money.
furthermore,
we
think
it's
democratic.
we
don't
a
mercenary
army.”
maybe
congress
does
think
that
there
are
valid
reasons
for
conscripting
men
instead
of
simply
having
volunteers
to
mend
this
standing
army
in
peace
time.
but
that
doesn't
change
the
power
that
congress
-–
that
was
delegated
to
congress
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
adopted.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
standing
armies
were
recognized,
your
honor,
but
never
of
conscripts.
conscription
for
a
standing
army
as
a
historical
fact
did
not
even
occur
until
after
the
constitution
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
i
think
it
was
of
limited
duration.
that
is,
my
recollection
is
that
the
standing
army
in
england
was
–-
well,
for
a
limited
period
of
time.
i
don't
remember
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i
don't
remember
exactly,
but
it
was
for
a
limited
period
of
time.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
but
it
was
-–
it
was
not
composed
of
conscripts.
it
was
volunteers
entirely,
except
-–
except
for
beggars.
that
is,
beggars
could
be
impressed
but
that
was
as
a
form
of
punishment.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
no,
i
think
your
honor,
the
historical
record
is
clear
that
the
power
to
raise
and
support
armies
is
included
because
a
standing
army
as
feared
as
it
was,
and
it
was
very,
very
much
feared
because
the
fear
was
that
congress
would
use
the
standing
army
to
eliminate
the
power
of
the
states
and
to
oppress
the
individual
citizens
in
the
states.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
oh
absolutely!
there
are
at
least
five
separate
preferences
to
militia.
that
is,
you
have
at
least
three
clauses
in
article
1
which
deal
expressly
with
militia.
and
again,
militia
were
to
be
called
and
specified
circumstance
only
while
the
emergency
lasted.
in
the
second
amendment
for
instance,
the
second
amendment
provides
that
individual
citizens
had
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
because
you
need
a
strong
militia
so
that
the
state
can
defend
itself.
the
argument
that
a
standing
army
was
all
right
was
based
repeatedly
on
the
argument
that
congress
could
never
amass
a
standing
army
of
such
power
that
it
could
overcome
the
power
of
the
states
because
they
had
the
militia
and
the
militia
were
very,
very
numerous.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
but
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
concept
of
a
standing
army
was
agreed
to
in
a
very,
very
limited
way
that
is
precisely
the
opposition
which
you
are
noted,
that
people
will
say,
“well,
you
don't
need
a
standing
army,
we've
got
our
state
militia.”
the
argument
was
well,
are
you
going
to
take
farmers
and
post
them
on
garrison
posts
on
the
frontiers
to
combat
the
unions?
we
need
an
army,
a
standing
army.
now,
what
did
that
mean?
the
very
first
congress
enacted
a
bill.
i
had
as
a
matter
of
fact,
starting
by
1789,
1790,
1791,
1792,
1793,
1794,
1795,
there
are
separate
bills,
numerous,
dealing
with
the
army,
the
standing
army,
as
well
as
with
militia
but
in
quite
separate
ways.
and
the
standing
army
that
was
provided
consisted
of
i
think
1,200
men,
meant
to
deal
very
expressly
with
the
problem
of
the
frontiers.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
have
no
rebuttal.
i
think
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
forgive
me,
your
honor.
in
any
event,
i
really
don't
think
i
should
spend
more
time
on
this
argument.
i
would
like
to
mention
another
separate
argument.
that
is,
i
simply
mentioned
that
in
passing.
that
is
that
if
a
non-volunteer
army
is
feasible,
congress
just
can't
pick
and
choose
ways
of
raising
men
and
say,
“well,
we're
not
going
to
spend
the
money
so
that
we'll
have
this
money
available
for
the
project.”
that
is,
if
they
can
raise
volunteers,
they're
required
to
raise
volunteers
for
the
standing
army.
that
was
the
original
concept.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
concept
-–
the
word
“raise
armies”
is
used
repeatedly
by
the
first
congress,
by
the
early
congresses,
and
they
specified
that
they
mean
volunteers
and
the
deal
with
militia
entirely
separately.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
one
case,
they
increased
the
size
of
the
authorized
army
i
think
to
5,000
men,
and
they
said,
“but
we
want
to
make
it
clear
that
as
soon
as
the
emergency
is
over,
that
army
is
to
be
disbanded.
we
don't
want
it
around.
we
want
that
number
reduced
to
1,500.”
and
so
now,
i
won't
even
touch
on
the
argument
that
the
power
of
congress
is
further
limited
so
that
it
can't
raise
an
army
for
an
illegal
war.
now,
that's
dealt
within
our
brief.
i
think
it's
much
too
complex
to
even
begin
at
this
point.
i
would,
if
i
may,
like
to
turn
for
the
remaining
time
to
the
solicitor's
argument
with
respect
to
the
establishment
issue,
as
well
as
the
free
exercise
issue.
incidentally,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
checked
in
to
various
authorities
on
the
question
bearing
on
whether
we
have
an
rest
of
judgment
decision
more
in
a
-–
well,
another
authority,
i'm
very
bad
on
issues,
right,
it
simply
don't
communicate
if
there's
anything
to
be
done
after
you
grant
the
motion
of
rest
of
judgment,
you
grant
it
and
that's
it.
and
i
checked
the
records
in
this
court
in
the
cases
of
bramblett
as
well
as
the
case
of
green,
they
are
cited
at
page
15
of
our
brief,
and
i
looked
at
the
order
entered
by
the
lower
courts
in
those
cases
and
that's
all
they
say,
motion
to
rest
of
judgment
granted.
i
found
no
indication
that
there's
anything
else
which
anyone
else
thought
needed
to
be
done.
on
the
establishment
question
simply
indicate
that
on
the
basis
of
the
solicitor
general's
argument,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
act
tends
to
establish
pacifist
religions.
that's
what
the
act
has
intended
-–
well,
it
isn't
intended
to
establish
them
but
it
is
intended
to
protect
members
of
pacifist
religions.
now,
the
solicitor
general
says,
“that's
alright,
that's
alright
because
religion
doesn't
mean
what
we
say
it
means
within
the
first
amendment,”
and
that's
because
the
first
amendment
somehow
can't
be
used
in
this
way
to
limit
the
power
of
congress
to
raise
and
support
armies.
i
think
that
-–
that
logically
it
falls
from
everything
i've
said
up
to
now,
that
that
just
isn't
true.
historically,
that
is
completely
inaccurate.
now,
on
the
free
exercise
of
religion
argument,
there's
an
important
misconception
that
must
be
dealt
with.
we're
not
dealing
here
with
a
non-religious
objector,
i
mentioned
that
yesterday.
this
man
is
a
non-religious
in
the
statutory
sense,
conscientious
objector.
now,
the
question
is
whether
he's
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
selective
objector.
now,
that's
correct
your
honor.
now,
the
question
is
not
whether
he
can
pick
and
choose
his
war
but
whether
religions,
including
established
religions,
recognize
the
concept
of
just
war.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
the
fact
that
today
at
least,
protestant,
catholic,
jewish
organizations,
the
vatican
council,
all
have
made
it
perfectly
plain
that
they
think
that
there
are
differences
between
wars.
some
wars
are
okay
and
some
aren't.
that
is,
as
religious
organizations,
it
just
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
the
argument
can
be
made
that
if
a
man
objects
to
a
particular
war,
he
necessarily
has
a
“political”
objection
as
opposed
to
a
religious
objection.
that
just
doesn't
square
with
the
facts.
again,
i
think
that
whether
you
reach
this
conclusion
or
not
depends
on
your
concept
of
the
power
of
congress
to
raise
and
support
armies.
if
you
conceive
of
it
as
being
completely
uncontrollable,
then
it
might
make
sense
to
apply
much
more
restrictive
notion
of
what
is
meant
by
religion
in
the
first
amendment
insofar
as
it
relates
to
the
power
of
congress
to
raise
and
support
armies.
but
i
just
don't
think
there's
any
support,
any
historical
support
with
the
view
that
congress
in
1789
could
simply
reach
out
and
say,
“i'm
going
to
take
you.
i
know
its
peace
time.
i
know
we
don't
have
any
wars,
but
we've
got
-–
we've
got
to
have
a
strong
army.”
just
absolutely
no
support
for
that
view.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i'll
submit.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
first
to
address
myself
to
the
question
whether
the
decision
arresting
judgment
of
conviction
was
in
fact
entered
by
the
court
below.
i
note
parenthetically
that
the
government's
brief
at
pages
7
and
8
states,
“appellees
motion
which
the
trial
judge
granted
purported
to
be
in
and
was
treated
by
the
district
court
as
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
this
--
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
submitted
in
accordance
with
the
times
spelled
out
in
rule
34
or
the
making
of
such
motions
after
the
jury's
verdict
of
guilty.
a
ground
on
which
the
motion
rested
but
the
indictment
did
not
charge
an
offense
similarly
fell
within
the
traditional
scope
of
such
motions
is
expressly
recognized
in
rule
34.
i
have
assumed
for
proposes
of
my
brief
an
argument
before
this
court
today,
that
the
government
agreed
with
our
position
that
what
the
judge
in
fact
granted
was
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment.
i
think
that
assumption
is
supported
by
the
record.
on
the
date
when
the
verdict
of
guilty
was
rendered
by
the
jury,
the
judge
said,
this
appears
at
page
197
of
the
record.
he
said
march
31st
as
the
date
for
sentencing
that
is,
“had
no
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
then
filed
and
there
was
no
guarantee
at
any
such
motion
would
be
filed
by
sisson
in
this
case.
sentencing
would
have
occurred
on
march
31st.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i
think
rule
34
expressly
limits
the
time
within
which
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
can
be
made.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
it
will
carry
the
10
days
following
the
verdict
guilty
or
within
such
further
time
as
the
court
allow
us.
but
as
of
the
date
of
the
jury's
verdict,
there
were
10
days
within
which
the
motion
could
be
filed.
if
no
such
motion
was
filed
on
march
31st,
the
expiration
of
the
10-day
period
sentencing
was
to
occur.
moreover,
the
docket
in
the
case
is
reproduced
at
the
beginning
of
the
record
on
appeal
at
pages
3,
and
4,
and
5
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
an
indication
spelling
out
the
judgment
the
decision
of
the
district
court
as
follows.
the
defendant
with
his
counsel
and
government
counsel
present,
the
court
reads
its
opinion
granting
defendants
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
pursuing
to
rule
34
by
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
excerpts
quoted
below,
“in
the
words
of
rule
34
the
indictment
of
sisson
does
not
charge
an
offense.”
this
court's
decision
arresting
a
judgment
of
conviction
for
inefficiency
of
the
indictment
is
based
upon
the
invalidity
of
the
statute
upon
which
the
indictment
is
founded
within
the
meaning
of
those
phrases
as
used
in
18
u.s.c.
section
3731.
then,
the
century
in
the
docket
continues
and
concludes
court
orders
this
decision
and
this
court's
order
granting
defendants
sisson's
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
enter
forthwith.
on
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
statute
in
conferring
jurisdiction
upon
this
court
on
appeal,
on
direct
appeal
from
judgments
of
the
district
court,
granting
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment.
we
concur
with
the
position
of
the
government
that
indeed
this
court
does
have
jurisdiction
under
the
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
provision
of
section
3731
of
the
criminal
appeals
act.
in
addition,
it
is
our
position
that
the
government
saw
an
argument
with
respect
to
the
other
two
clauses
the
plea
in
bar,
as
well
as
leave
motion
dismissing
an
indictment.
really,
really
is
quite
persuasive
that
the
intent
of
the
draftsmen
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
was
precisely
to
confer
upon
this
court
jurisdiction
in
all
cases
which
were
not
precluded
by
the
constitution
by
reason
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
now,
i
have
in
mind
for
instance
and
i'm
simply
selecting
randomly
on
page
22
of
the
government's
brief.
there
is
a
quotation
from
senator
bacon,
which
he
indicates
that,
“the
jeopardy
clause
was
inserted
in
the
motion
in
bar
subdivision
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution.”
the
caution,
i
suggest
to
the
court
in
context
were
simply
that
they
wanted
to
be
quite
clear
that
they
were
not
purporting
to
grand
jurisdiction
in
cases
which
are
constitutionally
proscribe.
now,
as
a
reference
to
the
purpose
which
the
statute
was
intended
to
serve
on
that
same
page,
page
22
of
the
brief.
the
purpose
was
simply
to
meet
the
problem
of
having
district
court
judge's
dismissing
criminal
prosecutions.
in
particular
there
was
a
case
against
--
cherry
meat
packers.
the
court
dismissed
the
proceedings
and
the
government
was
powerless
to
do
anything
about
it.
and
congress
wanted
to
ensure
that
that
sort
of
a
result
simply
could
not
have
it.
it
wanted
to
provide
review
in
this
court
to
ensure
that
those
sorts
of
decisions
would
be
reviewed
by
the
court
and
i
don't
think
there's
a
shred
of
evidence
which
indicates
that
the
congress
intended
by
providing
various
loopholes
to
make
it
possible
by
supposedly,
well,
a
district
judge
bent
on
circumventing
the
appeals
provision
of
the
criminal
appeals
act.
to
simply
avoid
this
result
namely
of
providing
review
in
this
court
by
for
instance
permitting,
well
the
procedure
which
was
followed
in
this
case.
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
present
cases
the
prototype
of
the
situation,
which
the
draftsmen
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
could
not
possibly
have
intended
to
result
in
precluding
review
by
this
court.
that
is
simply
would
be
much
too
easy
to
circumvent
the
purpose
of
the
draftsmen
of
the
act.
now
on
page
23,
senator
nelson
expressly
says
again
i'm
quoting
the
quotation,
elsewhere
said
that,
“the
plain
bar
section,
it
was
made
clear
out
of
the
extreme
caution
that
where
the
defendant
has
been
put
in
jeopardy,
he
cannot
be
reindicted.”
the
emphasis
again
was
on
the
question
whether
the
defendant
having
filed
whatever
motions
been
filed.
having
that
motion
granted
by
the
court
whether
he
could
be
reindicted
and
i
don't
think,
there's
any
question
or
is
there
any
suggestion
by
the
government
that
in
circumstances
where
a
defendant
files
a
motion
in
bar
or
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
that
he
could
in
fact
be
reindicted
if
the
motion
were
granted
in
subsequently
that
decision
were
vacated.
now,
the
government
at
page
25
quotes
justice
holmes
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
macdonald
and
indeed,
justice
holmes
refers
to
judgments
rendered
before
the
moment
of
jeopardy
is
reach.
what
is
omitted
immediately
succeeding
the
quotation
that
is
the
text
includes
a
citation
to
the
decision
in
kepner
against
united
states
at
195
u.s.
and
in
that
decision
justice
holmes
we
quote
from
him
in
our
brief,
they
declare
that
he
consider
the
double
jeopardy
question
to
be
a
very
limited
one.
that
is
he
pointed
out
there
are
numerous
circumstances
in
which
a
man
can
be
retried
after
having
once
been
tried
and
found
guilty
by
a
jury
without
contravening
the
double
jeopardy
safeguard
in
the
constitution.
it
won't
leave
where
the
point
anymore,
i
would
like
again
to
refer
to
the
testimony
of
senator
knox
which
is
quoted
at
pages
26
and
27
of
the
government's
brief
in
which
senator
knox
refers
to
all
of
the
motions
that
is
the
merit
to
the
indictment,
the
motion
to
quash
or
set
aside
the
indictment,
motion
and
arrest
of
judgment
and
in
judgment
sustaining
defendant's
plea
in
bar.
and
he
refers
to
all
of
these
motions,
as
motions
the
effect
of
which
is
to
defeat
jeopardy.
i
believe
that's
accurate
in
glossing
of
what
is
--
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
if
the
judgment
is
affirmed?
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
i
believe
that
the
conviction
is
set
aside.
that
is
the
judgment
of
the
court
is
--
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
right.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
the
judgment
is
arrested,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
right
and
--
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
well
--
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
so
far
as
we're
concerned,
your
honor,
quite
frankly,
i'm
not
prepared
to
respond
to
that.
i
haven't
thought
of
the
problem
but
i
will
represent
that
will
be
satisfied
with
--
when
were
judgment
in
this
court
saying
affirmed,
i
think,
we
can
deal
with
the
problem
once
--
once
that
action
is
taken.
i
would
--
by
way
of
context,
there
just
isn't
enough
time
remaining
today
to
deal
with
all
of
the
issues
particularly
the
first
amendment
issues,
selective
objective
question.
i
would
like
to
refer,
if
i
may,
to
some
of
the
statement
made
by
solicitor
general
griswold
because
i
consider
that
some
of
the
difficulties
in
hearing
in
this
case
arise
from
assumptions
made
by
the
solicitor
general,
which
are
not
dealt
with
it
at
all
in
either
of
the
briefs.
that
is
--
the
assumptions
for
instance
is
that
when
congress
acts
that
somehow
there
is
a
presumption
which
arises
from
the
action
of
congress,
which
is
sufficient
to
simply
overcome
whatever
claims
an
individual
might
make.
we're
certainly
not
challenging
our
system
of
government
in
this
case.
we're
not
challenging
democracy
or
majority
rule.
we're
not
requesting
that
this
court
imposed
its
judgments
and
substitute
it
for
the
judgment
of
the
legislature
of
congress.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
the
issue
presented
before
this
court
is
limited
solely
to
the
question
or
the
man
can
be
deprived
of
his
liberty
and
compelled
to
kill
conceivably.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
that's
true.
that's
true
he
might.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
but
initially
--
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
right.
initially
at
the
very
least,
we're
only
certain
that
he
was
to
be
deprived
of
his
liberty.
i
would
submit
that
that's
efficient
for
purposes
of
distinguishing
this
case
from
a
tax
case.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
it
is
--
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i
think
at
this
point,
we
do.
that
is,
with
--
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
speculate
about
where
he
might
have
been
sent,
that
is
we
have
statistics
showing
that
he
had
two
out
of
three
chances
of
being
sent
to
vietnam
at
least.
but
what
happened
was
that
he
refused
to
submit
to
induction
and
he
refused
to
submit
to
obey
an
order
which
was
issued
to
him.
and
the
government
asserts
in
various
places
that
whether
this
conduct
is
criminal
or
not
depends
on
the
validity
of
the
order.
now,
we
assert
that
the
order
as
such,
which
precedes
any
assignment
of
the
conscript
to
any
field
of
duty
whether
to
paris
or
vietnam,
or
any
other
locations.
we
assert
that
that
order
was
in
it
of
itself
invalid
for
variety
of
reasons.
i
would
in
the
time
remaining
this
afternoon,
simply
like
to
address
myself
to
two
points.
one
will
be
in
passing.
i'll
refer
to
recent
book
written
by
a
man
named
raoul
berger
entitled
“congress
against
the
supreme
court”
in
which
the
point
is
made
i
think
quite
convincingly.
the
judicial
review
in
this
court
is
not
a
matter
of
user
patient
by
this
court
but
was
something
intended
very
definitely
by
the
framers
of
the
constitution,
precisely
to
provide
a
safeguard
against
the
encroachment
of
individual
liberty
by
congress.
i
would
only
like
to
refer
to
two
quotations;
one
is
from
page
31
of
this
book
its
a
1969
book
by
jefferson.
jefferson
in
1781
stated,
“that
173
despots
would
surely
be
as
oppressive
as
one
and
elective
despotism
was
not
the
government
we
fought
for.”
similarly,
madison
in
dealing
with
the
purpose
of
the
bill
of
rights
stated,
“these
amendments
are
incorporated
into
the
constitution,
independent,
tribunals
of
justice
will
consider
themselves
in
a
peculiar
manner
the
guardians
of
those
rights.
it
will
be
and
impenetrable
ball
work
against
every
assumption
of
power
in
the
legislative
or
executive.
now,
the
notion
that
the
federal
congress
might
arrogate
to
itself,
powers
and
infringing
individual
liberty
was
something
of
which
the
framers
was
--
were
very,
very
conscious.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
they
were
concerned
principally
about
congress,
the
federal
congress.
they
were
not
particularly
concern
about
state
legislatures.
they
have
faith
in
their
state
legislators.
they
knew
but
they
knew
nothing
whatsoever
about
this
new
organ.
this
federal
legislature
that
was
to
sit
at
times
1,000
miles
away
from
some
parts
of
this
vast
land.
and
the
people
were
afraid
that
precisely
the
federal
government
would
reach
out
and
deprive
them
of
fundamental
liberties.
for
this
purpose,
this
court
was
vested
with
judicial
review
with
the
power
of
deciding
where
the
congress
has
exceeded
the
limits
of
its
power,
of
the
limited
delegated
powers
conferred
by
the
constitution.
this
doctrine
was
asserted
repeatedly
throughout
the
time
of
the
ratification
of
framing
of
the
constitution
that
is
set
on
the
verdict
book.
it
was
reiterated
by
this
court
in
luther
against
borden
in
the
middle
of
19th
century.
the
only
other
point,
i
wish
to
make
is
the
repeated
insistence
by
the
solicitor
general
to
history
that
on
the
basis
of
the
history
surrounding
the
adoption
of
the
bill
of
rights.
there
is
no
basis
for
this
court
concluding
that
religion
is
coextensive
with
the
rights
of
conscience.
i
submit
and
i
do
it
diffidently
i
was
one
of
the
students
and
this
is
a
great
man,
vast
knowledge
of
taxation
certainly
but
i
respectfully
suggest
that
his
knowledge
--
the
scope
of
the
religion
protection
is
not
accurate,
it's
simply
is
not
accurate.
i
refer
for
instance
to
the
part
of
our
brief
at
pages
97
through
102.
in
particular,
i
have
reference
to
ratification
statements,
free
ratification
statements,
that
is
before
the
bill
of
rights
was
in
existence,
that
is
i
posit
it
to
this
court
the
situation
where
there
is
no
bill
of
rights
where
there
is
not
first
amendment
to
be
construed.
and
i
ask
this
court
whether
in
that
circumstance
this
court
could
reach
the
conclusion
that
religion
does
not
extend
to
the
right
of
conscience
or
that
the
constitution
was
intended
to
deprive
individuals
of
the
protection
of
religion,
the
free
exercise
of
religion.
i
refer
in
particular
to
declarations
of
rights
made
by
the
conventions
of
new
york,
rhode
island,
north
carolina,
and
virginia.
these
declarations
assert
the
existence
of
certain
inalienable
rights
and
make
it
very
clear
that
the
constitution
was
being
ratified
only
with
the
expressed
understanding
that
these
rights
were
not
infringed
by
the
constitution.
that
was
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
bill
of
rights.
one
of
these
rights
was,
“that
the
people
have
an
equal
and
natural
and
an
alienable
right
freely
and
peaceably
to
exercise
their
religion
according
to
the
dictates
of
their
conscience
and
that
no
religious
sect
or
society
ought
to
be
favored
or
established
by
law
in
preference
of
others.”
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
it
gets
into
this
case
in
this
way
your
honor.
the
argument
of
the
government
relies
on
the
proposition
that
somehow
the
word
religion
has
grown
beyond
its
intended
scope.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
on
a
constitutional
basis,
we
always
have.
that
is
it
isn't
--
isn't
an
inaccurate
statement
to
describe
sisson
as
a
selective
nonreligious
objector.
he
is
a
selective
nonreligious
conscientious
objector
and
the
very
necessity
for
making
that
distinction
between
the
religious
objector
or
rather
nonreligious
objecting
--
nonreligious
conscientious
objector
is
the
fact
that
the
act,
as
the
solicitor
general
so
eagerly
defended
it,
makes
that
distinction.
it
does
not
extend
the
scope
of
the
exemption
in
the
act
to
the
full
measure
of
protection
and
afforded
to
religion
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
we
left
off
suggesting
that
if
there
were
no
bill
of
rights
at
all,
this
court
would
nonetheless
be
required
by
the
constitution
as
adopted
by
the
framers,
by
the
state
ratifying
conventions
as
they
understood
the
constitution
would
require
this
court
nonetheless
to
protect
the
individual
rights
of
citizens
–
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
on
page
98
through
99
of
our
brief
-–
i'm
sorry,
it's
page
100
through
101.
we
quote
from
a
statement
made
by
the
rhode
island
ratifying
convention,
which
is
virtually
identical,
i
think
there
are
very
minor
changes
in
language
that
is
almost
identical
to
the
statements
made
by
the
north
carolina
and
virginia
ratifying
conventions,
i'm
sorry.
and
the
statement
states,
that
is
that's
just
a
very
small
portion
of
the
statement
made
by
the
ratifying
convention.
the
ratifying
convention
said
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
by
the
ratifying
convention
of
the
state
of
rhode
island,
your
honor,
almost
identical
to
the
statement
made
by
the
ratifying
convention
of
the
state
of
north
carolina,
as
well
as
the
state
of
virginia.
these
statements
expressly
asserted
that
ratification
of
the
constitution
was
based
on
an
expressed
understanding
that
it
did
not
infringe
unalienable
rights
of
individual
citizens.
the
fourth
paragraph,
the
fourth
proposition
stated
in
that
ratifying
statement
is
that
religion
or
the
duty
which
we
owe
to
our
creator
in
the
manner
of
discharging
it
can
be
directed
only
by
reason
and
conviction
and
not
by
force
or
violence.
and
therefore,
all
men
have
an
equal,
natural
and
inalienable
right
to
the
free
exercise
of
religion
according
to
the
dictates
of
conscience
and
that
no
particular
religious
sect
or
society
ought
to
be
favored
or
established
by
law
in
preference
to
others.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
100
through
101,
your
honor,
the
bottom
of
100
through
the
top
of
101.
that
statement
is
virtually
identical
to
the
statement
made
from
the
ratifying
convention
of
the
state
of
new
york.
i
accorded
that
at
the
end
of
the
argument
yesterday.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
very
late,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i'm
not
sure,
but
i
think
among
the
four
states
represented
in
these
statements,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
there
would
have
been
no
ratification
of
the
constitution
but
for
the
expressed
understanding
that
these
rights
were
safeguarded.
that
is,
there
was
no
need
for
the
bill
of
rights
to
protect
religion
as
understood
by
the
persons
who
drafted
and
who
ratified
the
constitution.
it's
true
that
a
bill
of
rights
were
subsequently
enacted
but
madison
explained,
and
that's
quoted
at
the
bottom
of
98
through
top
of
99,
“although
i
know
whenever
the
great
rights,
the
trial
by
jury,
freedom
of
the
press,
of
liberty
of
conscience
come
in
question
in
that
body,
the
invasion
of
them
is
resisted
by
able
advocates.
yet,
their
magna
carta
does
not
contain
any
one
provision
for
the
security
of
those
rights
respecting
which
the
people
of
america
are
most
alarmed.”
the
freedom
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
i
have
–-
these
are
just
random
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
that's
a
separate
question,
your
honor.
it
certainly
is
related
and
that's
why
i
mentioned
it
at
this
point,
but
i'm
simply
addressing
myself
now
to
the
assertion
made
by
the
government
that
religion
does
not
mean
conscience.
and
i
think
that's
clearly
wrong
from
the
standpoint
of
history.
i
can
understand
the
government's
inclination
so
to
construe
the
protection
of
religion
in
the
bill
of
rights.
i
understand
why
they
would
like
to
limit
it,
but
it's
just
flatly
inaccurate
as
a
matter
of
history.
that's
just
not
what
they
understood
180
years
ago.
what
we're
calling
for
is
not
something
which
would
destroy
orderly
government
at
all.
obviously,
what
would
be
most
destructive
of
orderly
government
would
be
if
the
constitution
were
ignored,
and
we
want
the
constitution
enforced.
that
is,
the
constitution
says
certain
things
about
what
powers
congress
have,
and
i
will
come
very
quickly
to
that
central
question.
that
is,
what
power
did
congress
receive
through
the
constitution
to
draft
individuals,
whether
in
peace
or
in
order.
that's
the
central
issue.
obviously,
if
the
constitution
did
not
delegate
this
power
to
congress,
congress
doesn't
have
it.
even
if
congress
would
like
to
have
it,
even
if
congress
thinks
that
it
is
absolutely
indispensable
in
its
judgment
to
have
that
power,
if
that
power
was
not
conferred
by
the
constitution,
it's
perfectly
plain
they
don't
have
the
power.
the
constitution
sets
the
limits
of
the
power
that
were
in
fact
conferred
to
congress.
now,
i'm
simply
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
that
is
not
our
proposition,
your
honor.
that
is
–-
i
think
there's
a
very
important
distinction
between
a
man
who
acts
on
the
basis
of
conscience
that
is
who
simply
can't
obey
the
order.
that's
on
that
system.
and
a
man
who
thinks,
well,
it'd
be
a
bad
policy
to
follow,
to
go
fight
a
war
in
vietnam
--
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor,
but
that's
a
very
customary
function
in
law,
that
is
we're
constantly
–-
the
courts,
that
is
–-
are
constantly
about
the
business
of
establishing
where
the
man
intended
to
do
something
around
it,
but
just
don't
know
how
to
avoid
that.
but
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i
think
so,
your
honor.
but
is
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
in
a
sense,
that's
true,
but
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
that's
the
military
service.
that
is,
he
disobeyed
an
order.
he
disobeyed
that
order
on
the
basis
of
his
conviction
that
the
order
was
invalid.
now
at
this
point,
i
really
don't
think
that
the
question
is
whether
his
subjective
belief
was
well
founded.
at
least
the
threshold
question
is
whether
from
an
objective
point
of
view,
he
was
right,
whether
the
order
was
valid.
did
congress
in
fact
have
the
power
to
issue
the
order
to
this
man
that
he
report
for
induction
because
if
congress
had
no
such
power,
simply
to
induct
him
into
the
army,
then
refusal
to
obey
the
order
simply
is
not
a
criminal
act.
and
that's
independent
of
what
he
may
have
believed
to
doubt
the
vietnam
war
or
may
not
have
believed.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i
think
so,
your
honor.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
from
the
outset,
the
motion
is
filed,
the
pre-trial
motion
is
filed
in
this
case
squarely
raised
and
the
government
has
so
recognized
–-
squarely
raised
that
the
initial
question
raised
by
the
appellee
was
simply
the
power
of
congress
to
issue
that
order
to
him,
and
he
said
no,
congress
does
not
have
that
power.
that
is,
if
he
had
said
nothing
about
his
beliefs.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
i
think,
your
honor.
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question
that
there's
on
the
issues
which
were
properly
raised
one
issue,
very
definitely
is
the
issue
which
the
district
judge
in
fact
based
his
decision
upon.
that
is,
the
right
of
johny
sisson
to
exercise
freely
his
religion
under
the
first
amendment.
or
alternatively,
the
question,
the
issue
whether
the
selective
service
act
of
1967
constitutes
an
establishment
of
religion.
but
that
--
those
were
just
two
of
the
issues
raised.
we
repeatedly
reasserted
and
reasserted
again
in
the
motion
in
the
rest
of
judgment.
the
threshold
question
obviously
has
to
be
whether
the
order
issued
to
johny
sisson
was
invalid.
it
might
have
been
invalid
for
a
number
of
technical
reasons.
now,
those
technical
reasons
–-
technical
deficiencies
in
the
order
did
not
appear
at
the
trial.
if
such
deficiencies
had
appeared
in
fact,
the
case
would
not
be
here,
certainly
not
on
direct
appeal.
that
is,
the
only
questions
presently
being
raised
are
questions
bearing
on
the
validity,
constitutionality
of
that
order.
and
the
point
we
repeatedly
stressed
is
that
congress
just
does
not
have
power
to
conscript
sisson
now.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
the
particular
reason,
your
honor,
is
that
congress
is
powered
to
raise
and
support
arguments,
which
is
the
clause
on
which
the
government
relies
squarely,
does
not
extend
–-
it
is
not
an
unlimited
power.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
it
is
limited
first
of
all
to
circumstances
where
an
emergency
exists.
i
know
that
that's
somewhat
vague,
but
i
think
by
looking
at
the
historical
interpretation
of
congress'
power,
we
can
derive
very
definite
meaning
as
to
what
the
framers
of
the
constitution
understood,
what
members
of
the
first
congress
understood
by
the
power
to
raise
and
support
arguments.
now
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i
think
the
most
solid
point
we
have
is
the
point
that
congress
has
no
power
to
draft
in
an
emergency,
which
usually
will
mean
the
same
thing
as
no
power
to
draft
absent
to
declaration
of
war.
but
the
reason
i
think
i
don't
–-
we
do
not
assert
that
in
that
form,
that
is
that
congress
can't
conscript
unless
there's
been
a
declaration
of
war,
is
that
we
concede
that
in
a
number
of
the
emergencies,
even
if
there
were
no
declaration
of
war,
congress
would
have
the
power
to
conscript
because
i
just
don't
believe
that
congress
is
powerless
to
defend
this
country.
this
country
must
have
the
power
to
survive.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
i'm
not
saying
that
either,
your
honor,
but
i
am
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
that's
right.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes.
one
example
of
an
emergency,
your
honor,
would
be
the
civil
war.
that
is
civil
war
was
not
a
declared
war.
it
was
an
insurrection
and
indeed,
congress
did
adopt
the
conscription
act.
we're
not
challenging
the
power
of
congress
to
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
we're
saying
that
this
war
in
the
present
circumstances
just
doesn't
amount
to
the
kind
of
emergency
that
must
have
been
contemplated
by
the
draftsmen
of
the
constitution.
that
is
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor.
certainly,
the
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor.
time
of
peace
again
is
somewhat
misleading
because
that
may
be
thought
to
mean
the
absence
of
a
declaration
of
war.
but
i
think
what
is
at
issue
is
the
existence
of
an
emergency
that
it
makes
it
very,
very
clear
that
congress
has
no
choice,
that
it
must
conscript
because
if
it
doesn't
conscript
for
a
national
security
is
in
a
very
mediate
sense
at
stake.
i
don't
think
there's
much
ambiguity
about
what
the
power
of
congress
is
meant
for
the
first
150
years
of
the
existence
of
this
country.
that
is,
peace
time
conscription
as
we
know
it
is
very,
very
recent
in
time,
just
–-
it
didn't
take
years.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
oh
definitely,
your
honor.
but
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
definitely
not,
no.
i
just
don't
think
they
have
that
power.
that
is,
if
that
had
been
even
remotely
suggested
at
the
time
that
the
constitution
was
ratified,
absolutely
no
question
but
that
that
the
constitution
would
not
have
been
ratified.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i'll
try,
your
honor.
there
are
several
steps
to
our
argument.
we
begin
with
a
broader
story
argument
and
with
a
relatively
narrow
argument
based
on
johnny
sisson.
first
argument
is
whether
congress
has
the
power
to
draft
anybody
at
this
time.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
no,
or
–-
no.
that
has
been
suggested
two
or
three
times.
i
hope
i
can
make
it
very
clear
that
that's
not
what
we
mean
at
all.
that
is,
if
congress
has
the
power
to
draft
people
in
general,
then
the
argument
which
we
are
now
making
is
not
relevant
at
all.
it
would
remain
a
subsequent,
a
different
question.
that
is,
assuming
that
congress
has
the
power
to
draft
the
generality
of
men
at
this
time,
are
they
nonetheless
restricted
by
the
individual
right
of
conscience,
the
right
to
free
exercise
of
religion,
so
that
they
can't
conscript
certain
classes
of
men.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
oh
no,
i
don't
think
that
that
follows
at
all.
you
might
disagree
on
political
grounds,
on
economic
grounds,
sociological
grounds.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
all
i
can
say,
your
honor,
is
again,
i'd
like
to
quote
madison
and
–-
well,
it
was
about
the
time
of
the
–-
he
was
at
that
time
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
your
honor
-–
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
your
honor,
it
is
a
difficult
problem.
the
judicial
system
is
full
of
very,
very
difficult
problems.
probably
no
more
important
questions
arise
and
when
the
individual's
rights
are
pitted
against
the
government's
power
and
--
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
--
it
is
this
court,
which
is
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
that
is
not
the
question
at
this
point,
your
honor.
if
you
would
please
–-
the
question
is
not
where
he
would
be
assigned
right
now.
the
question
of
the
power
of
the
congress
to
--
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
whether
he
wants
to
or
not
-–
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
--
whether
he
wants
to
or
not
is
not
the
issue,
not
the
issue.
he
might
want
to,
and
nonetheless
his
refusal
might
be
justified
if
there
was
no
power
to
issue
that
order.
the
threshold
question
is
whether
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
that's
exactly
what
we
say,
not
just
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
no,
no,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
your
honor,
it
got
into
this
case
because
we
raised
it
and
we
stressed
it
at
every
point.
this
is
not
a
new
point
on
appeal
at
all.
and
this
elicit
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
that
is
--
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
i
think
this
court
is
charged
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
--
yes.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
that
is,
there
are
a
number
of
grounds
which
we
assert.
but
i
would,
simply
as
the
last
comment
to
mr.
justice
marshall's
remark
with
respect
to
the
difficulty
of
ascertaining,
the
meaning
of
conscience
indicate
that
the
draftsmen
of
the
constitution
had
no
problem
with
that.
that
is,
i
quote
from
madison,
“the
freedom
of
the
press
and
rights
of
conscience,
those
choices,
privileges
of
the
people
are
unguarded
in
the
british
constitution”.
he
had
no
question,
but
that
if
there
were
no
bill
of
rights,
a
man's
right
of
conscience
would
nonetheless
be
protected.
he
didn't
need
a
bill
of
rights.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
precisely
the
argument
which
the
government
now
makes
was
the
argument
feared
back
then.
that
if
you
provided
a
bill
of
rights
then,
somebody
would
say,
“well,
that's
all
you
have.”
nothing
else
is
protected,
but
the
ninth
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i
missed
that,
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
no,
we
are
not.
we
made
several
arguments
and
we
maintain
them
all.
that
is,
generally
speaking,
there
are
two
arguments
and
the
first
argument
is
what
power
does
congress
have
under
the
clause
which
empowers
it
to
raise
and
support
armies,
independently
of
the
first
amendment.
the
second
argument
is
whether
that
power
is
in
some
specifically
–-
a
specific
way
limited
by
the
first
amendment.
i
am
not
addressing
myself
solely
to
the
first
question,
forgetting
about
the
bill
of
rights
altogether,
what
power
did
the
constitution
confer
upon
congress
to
raise
and
support
armies?
i
do
suggest
respectfully
that
the
history
of
the
ratification
of
the
constitution,
of
the
dates
at
the
constitutional
convention
simply
do
not
blame
themselves
to
any
interpretation
which
would
suggest
that
back
then,
it
was
thought
that
the
federal
government
-–
congress
could
simply
reach
out
and
pluck
people
out
for
universal
military
service.
that
--
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
in
time
of
national
emergency,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well
certainly,
the
congress.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
but
congress
defines
it
for
legislative
purposes.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
oh
no,
no.
if
all
he
asserted,
that's
a
perfect
example
to
distinguish
the
two
arguments.
that
is
if
–-
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
precise
-–
that
sort
of
-–
that
sort
of
argument
has
a
parallel
with
what
happened
during
the
war
of
1812.
that
is,
the
president
issued
quotas
the
governors
of
various
states,
and
the
war
was
thought
to
be
an
unconstitutional
war
by
many
governors,
particularly
in
new
england.
they
simply
refused
to
obey
that
order.
and
so
we're
not
going
to
supply
you
militia.
now,
furthermore,
some
of
the
militia
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
the
president
at
that
time,
your
honor,
was
madison.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor.
the
man
who
acted
not
under
the
power
to
raise
and
support
armies,
but
rather
under
the
militia
clauses
of
article
12
–-
of
article
1,
that
is,
the
constitution
provides
a
very,
very
plain
scheme,
provides
for
standing
armies.
those
were
very,
very,
very
much
feared.
in
addition
to
standing
armies
for
instance,
the
garrison,
the
frontier
posts
against
the
possibility
of
hostilities
with
the
invasions.
the
constitution
says
well,
if
you
have
an
insurrection
or
if
you
have
an
invasion,
or
if
you
have
a
problem
with
executing
the
laws,
you
can
call
out
the
state
militias.
the
calling
of
the
state
militias
meant
something
very
specific.
it
meant
you
could
only
call
them
for
three
months,
in
any
one
year.
you
could
only
call
them
in
rotation
so
that
if
you
called
them
in
once,
you
couldn't
call
them
again
until
every
other
able
bodied
man,
and
his
battalion
had
been
called.
furthermore,
you
didn't
call
them
for
a
specific
length
of
time.
you
just
called
them
out
for
that
particular
purpose.
if
you
had
a
problem
with
the
unions
in
one
location,
you
call
out
the
militia
and
they
dealt
with
the
unions
there
and
then
they
went
back
home
to
their
jobs,
farmers,
various
other
jobs
which
they
are
in.
that
was
the
scheme
which
the
constitution
provided.
that
is
that's
the
way
in
which
congress
was
to
deal
with
problems
of
national
defense.
we
are
conceding
that
in
addition
to
what
is
clearly
provided,
in
a
clear
case
of
national
emergency
where
the
national
survival
is
at
stake,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
congress
must
have
the
power
to
mobilize
every
resource.
and
certainly,
that
was
contemplated,
it
is
not
denied.
in
the
constitution
therefore,
we
don't
deny
that
it
must
exist
by
inference.
but
when
we
read
the
historical
record
without
which
that
was
simply
cannot
be
read,
that
is
you
just
can't
raise
and
support
armies
literally
unless
you
understand
what
they
meant
by
a
raise
and
support
armies.
now,
we
deal
with
the
historical
argument
at
length
in
our
brief.
i
think
we
demonstrate
very
clearly
that
the
power
to
conscript
was
feared.
it
was
not
even
used
in
the
revolutionary
war
except
in
very
limited
circumstances.
at
the
height
–-
at
the
height
of
the
idealism
which
motivated
the
men
who
were
fighting
for
their
freedom
of
this
country.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
we
would
have
a
very,
very
different
case,
your
honor,
but
that
is
precisely
what
we
have
in
mind.
that
is,
the
declaration
of
war
is
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but
that
would
be
one
very
clear
example
of
a
declaration
of
a
national
emergency.
it's
one
thing
to
say
we
really
need
to
do
this.
it's
quite
another
matter
to
enact
the
statute
which
is
designed
not
simply
to
meet
with
national
emergencies
but
to
deal
with
peace
time
conditions
and
to
apply
it
in
peace
time
rather
than
limiting
its
application
to
war
time
conditions,
or
national
emergency
conditions.
but
it
just
–-
it
just
was
beyond
anything
that
any
of
advancement
or
any
of
the
people
at
the
time
that
the
constitution
was
adopted
that
this
federal
government,
this
body
of
people
could
simply
reach
out
and
conscript
people.
if
they
can
do
it
now,
why
couldn't
they
have
done
it
back
then?
why
couldn't
they
simply
conscript
one
million
men?
we're
going
to
have
a
standing
army
of
one
million
men.
furthermore,
we're
going
to
induct
them,
we're
going
to
conscript
them
for
ten
years
because
we
think
we
ought
to
have
a
very
strong
army.
yet
it
just
is
inconceivable
that
that
power
was
granted.
it
just
was
not
granted.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
not
against
the
standing
army,
your
honor.
the
standing
army
composed
of
volunteers
is
precisely
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
of
conscripts,
yes,
your
honor.
during
the
first
150
years
of
the
history
of
this
country,
that's
precisely
what
congress
did
continuously.
it
resorted
to
volunteers,
not
for
various
reasons
of
social
policy.
congress
has
decided.
well,
we
don't
like
that
scheme.
that
is,
if
what
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
that's
correct,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
we
concede
there
is
power
to
conscript
when
you
have
a
genuine
national
emergency.
there
just
was
no
power
to
which
was
conferred.
to
raise
a
standing
army
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor.
you
can
determine
it
in
many,
many
ways.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
the
final
arbitrar
with
respect
to
the
limits
of
power
which
congress
has.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
always
this
court,
that
is.
i
don't
think
it's
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i
think
ultimately,
this
court
must
decide
any
argument
that
congress
has
exceeded
the
limits
of
its
power.
but
certainly,
action
taken
by
congress,
unequivocal
action
declaring
the
existence
of
an
emergency
would
be
very
persuasive,
not
necessarily
conclusive
but
i
think
we
–-
we
would
have
very,
very
little
hope
of
prevailing
if
congress
had
said
well,
we've
got
a
national
emergency
and
we
absolutely
need
to
conscript
men.
but
we
don't
have
that
situation
at
all.
for
the
last
six
years,
there've
been
studies
upon
studies
as
to
whether
volunteer
army
was
feasible,
clearly
testified
time
and
time
again
both
by
government
persons
who
opposed
a
no-volunteer
army
as
well
as
by
men
who
preferred
the
volunteer
army
that
it
is
feasible.
i
mean,
manpower
is
available.
it
just
costs
money.
but
that's
the
way
in
which
a
standing
army
has
been
raised
for
150
years.
and
it
was
never
suggested
that
congress
could
simply
say,
“well,
we
don't
think
we
ought
to
be
spending
money
this
way.
we're
not
going
to
do
it.
we'll
save
the
little
money.
furthermore,
we
think
it's
democratic.
we
don't
a
mercenary
army.”
maybe
congress
does
think
that
there
are
valid
reasons
for
conscripting
men
instead
of
simply
having
volunteers
to
mend
this
standing
army
in
peace
time.
but
that
doesn't
change
the
power
that
congress
-–
that
was
delegated
to
congress
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
adopted.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
standing
armies
were
recognized,
your
honor,
but
never
of
conscripts.
conscription
for
a
standing
army
as
a
historical
fact
did
not
even
occur
until
after
the
constitution
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
well,
i
think
it
was
of
limited
duration.
that
is,
my
recollection
is
that
the
standing
army
in
england
was
–-
well,
for
a
limited
period
of
time.
i
don't
remember
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i
don't
remember
exactly,
but
it
was
for
a
limited
period
of
time.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
but
it
was
-–
it
was
not
composed
of
conscripts.
it
was
volunteers
entirely,
except
-–
except
for
beggars.
that
is,
beggars
could
be
impressed
but
that
was
as
a
form
of
punishment.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
no,
i
think
your
honor,
the
historical
record
is
clear
that
the
power
to
raise
and
support
armies
is
included
because
a
standing
army
as
feared
as
it
was,
and
it
was
very,
very
much
feared
because
the
fear
was
that
congress
would
use
the
standing
army
to
eliminate
the
power
of
the
states
and
to
oppress
the
individual
citizens
in
the
states.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
oh
absolutely!
there
are
at
least
five
separate
preferences
to
militia.
that
is,
you
have
at
least
three
clauses
in
article
1
which
deal
expressly
with
militia.
and
again,
militia
were
to
be
called
and
specified
circumstance
only
while
the
emergency
lasted.
in
the
second
amendment
for
instance,
the
second
amendment
provides
that
individual
citizens
had
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
because
you
need
a
strong
militia
so
that
the
state
can
defend
itself.
the
argument
that
a
standing
army
was
all
right
was
based
repeatedly
on
the
argument
that
congress
could
never
amass
a
standing
army
of
such
power
that
it
could
overcome
the
power
of
the
states
because
they
had
the
militia
and
the
militia
were
very,
very
numerous.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
but
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
concept
of
a
standing
army
was
agreed
to
in
a
very,
very
limited
way
that
is
precisely
the
opposition
which
you
are
noted,
that
people
will
say,
“well,
you
don't
need
a
standing
army,
we've
got
our
state
militia.”
the
argument
was
well,
are
you
going
to
take
farmers
and
post
them
on
garrison
posts
on
the
frontiers
to
combat
the
unions?
we
need
an
army,
a
standing
army.
now,
what
did
that
mean?
the
very
first
congress
enacted
a
bill.
i
had
as
a
matter
of
fact,
starting
by
1789,
1790,
1791,
1792,
1793,
1794,
1795,
there
are
separate
bills,
numerous,
dealing
with
the
army,
the
standing
army,
as
well
as
with
militia
but
in
quite
separate
ways.
and
the
standing
army
that
was
provided
consisted
of
i
think
1,200
men,
meant
to
deal
very
expressly
with
the
problem
of
the
frontiers.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
have
no
rebuttal.
i
think
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
forgive
me,
your
honor.
in
any
event,
i
really
don't
think
i
should
spend
more
time
on
this
argument.
i
would
like
to
mention
another
separate
argument.
that
is,
i
simply
mentioned
that
in
passing.
that
is
that
if
a
non-volunteer
army
is
feasible,
congress
just
can't
pick
and
choose
ways
of
raising
men
and
say,
“well,
we're
not
going
to
spend
the
money
so
that
we'll
have
this
money
available
for
the
project.”
that
is,
if
they
can
raise
volunteers,
they're
required
to
raise
volunteers
for
the
standing
army.
that
was
the
original
concept.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
concept
-–
the
word
“raise
armies”
is
used
repeatedly
by
the
first
congress,
by
the
early
congresses,
and
they
specified
that
they
mean
volunteers
and
the
deal
with
militia
entirely
separately.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
one
case,
they
increased
the
size
of
the
authorized
army
i
think
to
5,000
men,
and
they
said,
“but
we
want
to
make
it
clear
that
as
soon
as
the
emergency
is
over,
that
army
is
to
be
disbanded.
we
don't
want
it
around.
we
want
that
number
reduced
to
1,500.”
and
so
now,
i
won't
even
touch
on
the
argument
that
the
power
of
congress
is
further
limited
so
that
it
can't
raise
an
army
for
an
illegal
war.
now,
that's
dealt
within
our
brief.
i
think
it's
much
too
complex
to
even
begin
at
this
point.
i
would,
if
i
may,
like
to
turn
for
the
remaining
time
to
the
solicitor's
argument
with
respect
to
the
establishment
issue,
as
well
as
the
free
exercise
issue.
incidentally,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
checked
in
to
various
authorities
on
the
question
bearing
on
whether
we
have
an
rest
of
judgment
decision
more
in
a
-–
well,
another
authority,
i'm
very
bad
on
issues,
right,
it
simply
don't
communicate
if
there's
anything
to
be
done
after
you
grant
the
motion
of
rest
of
judgment,
you
grant
it
and
that's
it.
and
i
checked
the
records
in
this
court
in
the
cases
of
bramblett
as
well
as
the
case
of
green,
they
are
cited
at
page
15
of
our
brief,
and
i
looked
at
the
order
entered
by
the
lower
courts
in
those
cases
and
that's
all
they
say,
motion
to
rest
of
judgment
granted.
i
found
no
indication
that
there's
anything
else
which
anyone
else
thought
needed
to
be
done.
on
the
establishment
question
simply
indicate
that
on
the
basis
of
the
solicitor
general's
argument,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
act
tends
to
establish
pacifist
religions.
that's
what
the
act
has
intended
-–
well,
it
isn't
intended
to
establish
them
but
it
is
intended
to
protect
members
of
pacifist
religions.
now,
the
solicitor
general
says,
“that's
alright,
that's
alright
because
religion
doesn't
mean
what
we
say
it
means
within
the
first
amendment,”
and
that's
because
the
first
amendment
somehow
can't
be
used
in
this
way
to
limit
the
power
of
congress
to
raise
and
support
armies.
i
think
that
-–
that
logically
it
falls
from
everything
i've
said
up
to
now,
that
that
just
isn't
true.
historically,
that
is
completely
inaccurate.
now,
on
the
free
exercise
of
religion
argument,
there's
an
important
misconception
that
must
be
dealt
with.
we're
not
dealing
here
with
a
non-religious
objector,
i
mentioned
that
yesterday.
this
man
is
a
non-religious
in
the
statutory
sense,
conscientious
objector.
now,
the
question
is
whether
he's
–-
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
selective
objector.
now,
that's
correct
your
honor.
now,
the
question
is
not
whether
he
can
pick
and
choose
his
war
but
whether
religions,
including
established
religions,
recognize
the
concept
of
just
war.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
the
fact
that
today
at
least,
protestant,
catholic,
jewish
organizations,
the
vatican
council,
all
have
made
it
perfectly
plain
that
they
think
that
there
are
differences
between
wars.
some
wars
are
okay
and
some
aren't.
that
is,
as
religious
organizations,
it
just
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
the
argument
can
be
made
that
if
a
man
objects
to
a
particular
war,
he
necessarily
has
a
“political”
objection
as
opposed
to
a
religious
objection.
that
just
doesn't
square
with
the
facts.
again,
i
think
that
whether
you
reach
this
conclusion
or
not
depends
on
your
concept
of
the
power
of
congress
to
raise
and
support
armies.
if
you
conceive
of
it
as
being
completely
uncontrollable,
then
it
might
make
sense
to
apply
much
more
restrictive
notion
of
what
is
meant
by
religion
in
the
first
amendment
insofar
as
it
relates
to
the
power
of
congress
to
raise
and
support
armies.
but
i
just
don't
think
there's
any
support,
any
historical
support
with
the
view
that
congress
in
1789
could
simply
reach
out
and
say,
“i'm
going
to
take
you.
i
know
its
peace
time.
i
know
we
don't
have
any
wars,
but
we've
got
-–
we've
got
to
have
a
strong
army.”
just
absolutely
no
support
for
that
view.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i'll
submit.
mr.
john
g.
s.
flym
thank
you,
your
honor.
