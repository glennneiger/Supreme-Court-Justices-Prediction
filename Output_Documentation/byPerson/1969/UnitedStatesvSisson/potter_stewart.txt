justice
potter
stewart
when
did
rhode
island
get
around
to
ratifying
the
constitution?
pretty
late
in
the
game,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
because
–-
well,
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
to
what
reason
in
your
submission
though
–-
what
particular
reason
are
you
submitting
to
us,
i'm
not
very
clear
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
alright,
but
then
what
-–
and
is
limited
in
what
respect
where
there's
a
vis-à-vis
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
are
you
saying
–-
i
know
that
perhaps
–-
i
know
in
your
brief,
you
say
a
variety
of
things
but
now,
are
you
directing
yourself
to
the
argument
that
congress
has
no
constitutional
power
to
enact
a
selective
service
act
when
there
is
no
declared
war?
or
are
you
saying
it
has
no
power
to
conscript
people
into
the
military
when
there
is
a
situation
going
on,
that
is
going
on
at
southeast
asia
that
violates
international
law?
what
are
you
-–
to
what
point
are
you
arguing
now
is
what
i
don't
quite
get.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
you're
saying
that
there's
no
power
to
--
a
constitutional
power
to
conscript
when
there
is
no
imminent
danger
of
invasion
of
this
country?
justice
potter
stewart
i
really
don't
understand
your
argument.
i
gather
though,
the
arguments
you're
making
now
has
nothing
to
do
with
sisson
as
such.
justice
potter
stewart
this
could
be
john
smith,
who's
a
religious
or
irreligious
person
who
has
no
particular
ideas
about
vietnam.
you're
talking
about
general
congressional
power?
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
you
challenging?
justice
potter
stewart
you
deny
the
power
–-
you
say
power
–-
the
congress
has
no
constitutional
power
to
conscript
from
like
universal
military
training?
justice
potter
stewart
definitely
yes
or
definitely
no?
justice
potter
stewart
insofar,
you
haven't
come
to
the
issues
discussed
by
the
solicitor
general.
you're
so
far
making
a
much
broader
argument
as
i
understand
it.
you
haven't
come
to
mr.
sisson
yet?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
telling
us
that
congress
has
no
constitutional
power
to
compel
military
service,
at
least
in
the
absence
of
a
declared
war
or
a
“national
emergency”
whatever
that
might
be,
and
you
say
there
is
not
now
a
national
emergency,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
you
haven't
come
to
mr.
sisson,
that
his
conscience
or
lack
of
it,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he's
a
non
-–
non-religious,
conscientious,
selective
objector?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you
very
much.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
we
could
not,
could
it
be
transferred
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
there's
no
appeal
anywhere?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
do
you
think
the
case
should
--
should
happen
to
the
case
and
that's
the
presumption?
justice
potter
stewart
what
posture
does
that
leaves
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
would
it
be
possible
to
vacate
the
proceeding
below,
send
them
back
to
the
district
court
and
they
can
do
what
they
think
should
be
done
by
way
of
appellate
jurisdiction
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
would
you
mr.
solicitor,
would
you
be
up
against
at
least
the
problem
whether
even
that
would
constitute
a
violation
of
double
jeopardy?
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
--
we
certainly
have
enough
jurisdictions
to
say
what
whether
we
have
to?
justice
potter
stewart
when
did
rhode
island
get
around
to
