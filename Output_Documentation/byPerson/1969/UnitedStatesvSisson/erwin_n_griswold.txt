mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
too
is
a
draft
case
raising
two
new
unrelated
and
difficult
problems.
in
a
third
aspect
it's
like
the
welsh
case
which
has
just
been
argued.
and
for
my
argument
on
the
question
relating
to
religious
training
and
belief,
i
rely
on
the
argument
in
the
case
just
concluded.
the
defendant
here
was
indicted
for
failing
to
report
for
induction.
there
was
a
trial
before
jury
at
which
the
defendant
testified.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty.
the
defendant
then
made
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment.
in
his
motion,
the
defendant
said
that
he
could
not
participate
in
the
vietnam
war
without
doing
violence
to
the
dictates
of
his
conscience.
and
he
further
stated
that,
he
cannot
qualify
as
a
conscientious
objector
within
the
meaning
of
the
military
selective
service
act
of
1967
because
he
is
not
a
pacifist.
and
in
any
event,
his
convictions
that
the
vietnam
war
is
illegal,
immoral,
and
unjust
are
not
based
on
religious
training
and
belief.
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
and
so
doing
it
referred
to
facts
which
had
appeared
at
the
trial
and
noted
that
particularly
the
defendants
own
testimony.
and
noted
that
“in
substance
the
case
arises
upon
an
agreed
statement
of
facts,”
that
appears
on
page
250
of
the
appendix.
i
can
state
that
none
of
the
facts
is
controvert.
we
do
not
dispute
that
the
appellee
was
sincerely
and
conscientiously
opposed
to
the
vietnam
conflict
based
on
his
moral
convictions,
educational
training,
extensive
reading
both
about
vietnam,
and
about
such
things
as
the
un
charter
and
the
nuremberg
trial.
as
i
have
indicated,
his
claim
is
selective
not
against
war
in
any
form
as
the
phrase
is
in
the
statute.
and
he
expressly
asserts
that
it
is
not
based
on
religious
training
and
belief.
in
this
situation,
the
district
court
held
that
the
appellee
had
a
valid
claim
to
be
constitutionally
exempted
from
combat
in
the
vietnam
type
of
situation.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
is
a
subject
to
which
i
am
about
to
address
my
argument.
it
is
the
--
i
was
trying
to
give
the
setting.
the
first
half
of
my
argument
is
devoted
to
jurisdiction
and
the
second
half
to
selective
conscientious
objection.
the
court
concluded
that
the
military
service
act
violated
the
free
exercise
in
due
process
clauses.
it
held
in
the
alternative
of
section
6
(j)
the
exemption
provision
violated
the
establishment
clause
and
that
it
unreasonably
discriminated
between
religious
and
non-religious
conscientious
objection.
from
this
decision,
the
united
states
took
this
appeal
purporting
to
act
under
the
second
clause
of
the
criminal
appeal
act
of
1907.
now,
found
in
title
18
of
the
united
states
code
section
3731,
the
relevant
passages
from
which
are
set
out
on
page
13
of
the
government's
brief.
and
now,
i
will
turn
to
the
jurisdictional
question
which
in
my
mind
is
a
very
close
question.
we
contend
that
there
is
jurisdiction
but
arguments
can
be
made
both
ways.
there's
no
doubt
that
there
was
a
trial
here
and
if
there
had
been
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
even
a
directive
verdict
of
not
guilty.
there
could
be
no
appeal
no
matter
what
error
of
law
was
made
by
the
trial
court.
an
illustration
of
that
is
found
in
the
case
decided
just
last
month
of
united
states
against
bond
which
is
set
out
in
appendix
to
one
of
the
briefs
filed
by
amici
curiae,
the
one
by
the
los
angeles
selective
service
law
panel.
in
the
bond
case,
judge
weigel
directed
the
verdict
for
the
defendant,
who
was
a
selective
conscientious
objector
based
on
religious
training
and
belief.
we
think
that
judge
weigel
was
wrong
as
the
matter
of
law
but
there's
nothing
we
can
do
about
it
and
we
have
of
course
taken
no
appeal.
the
difference
is
that
here
there
was
a
verdict
of
guilty
followed
by
a
motion
and
arrest
of
judgment
which
was
granted.
now,
if
judge
wyzanski
had
entered
an
order
saying,
having
examined
the
record
i
find
that
there
was
no
sufficient
evidence
to
submit
to
the
jury,
and
the
case
should
not
have
been
allowed
to
go
to
the
jury
and
accordingly,
i
direct
to
the
judgment
of
acquittal
be
entered.
i
think
we
would
be
so
close
to
the
situation
in
the
bond
case
that
we
couldn't
talked
about
it.
and
it
is
easy
i
think
to
say
that,
what
judge
wyzanski
did
is
not
different
in
substance
from
that
and
that
summarizes
the
difficulty
of
our
position
on
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
not
sure
mr.
justice.
the
judge
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
judge
has
decided
that
there
was
no
basis
in
law
for
the
verdict.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
not
in
the
appendix.
i
can't
tell
you
the
language.
the
opinion
is
here
but
the
actual
judgment
is
not
here.
i
discovered
to
my
surprise
last
night,
page
264,
enter
forthwith
this
decision
in
this
court's
order
granting
defendant
systems,
motion
and
arrest
of
judgment.
and
there
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
has
been
no
judgment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
250
--
250
is
the
only
place
that
i
can
find
it,
enter
forthwith
this
decision
and
this
court's
order,
granting
defendant
sisson's
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment.
now
that
is
in
arrest
of
judgment,
there
had
not
previously
been
any
judgment
and
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment,
not
in
arrest
of
the
execution
of
judgment
but
in
arrest
of
entering
judgment
as
i
interpret
it.
i
--
if
you're
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
verdict
is
in
a
historical
fact,
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
its
legal
effect
has
been
undermined
by
the
district
judge's
decision.
he
had
decided
that
it
is
not
a
proper
basis
to
found
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
conviction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
may
have
suggests
--
may
suggest
that
he
was
trying
to
preserve
a
situation
which
would
make
it
possible
for
us
to
appeal
to
this
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
--
that's
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
hate
to
be
arguing
against
myself
here
mr.
chief
justice,
but
he
has
left
the
verdict
stand
but
he's
pulled
all
the
foundation
out
from
under
so,
its
floats
in
space
i
guess.
it
is
no
longer
a
basis
for
entering
a
judgment
of
conviction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
from
--
it
is
from
a
judgment
or
order
in
arrest
of
judgment
which
is
the
express
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
you
don't
review
opinions
but
the
criminal
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
criminal
appeals
act
provides
that
there
is
an
appeal
to
this
court
from
a
decision
arresting
a
judgment
of
conviction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
from
a
decision
arresting
a
judgment
of
conviction
for
insufficient
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice.
i
think
the
decision
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
is
the
opinion
and
the
final
order
at
the
end,
beginning
on
page
248
and
concluding
on
page
264
of
the
appendix.
any
rate
that's
the,
not
only
the
only
order
there
is
but
that's
the
order
which
protects
system
and
from
which
the
government
is.
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
while
that
stands
sisson
completely
protected
and
that
is
the
order
from
which
the
government
is
seeking
to
give.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
was
a
motion
too
mr.
justice
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
which
was
--
which
was
denied
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
were
several
motions
before
a
trial,
all
of
which
were
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
this
motion,
the
arrest
of
judgment
to
some
extent
the
grounds
are
the
same
as
those
which
were
presented
in
motions
made
before
the
trial.
now
in
this
case,
if
the
motion
had
been
granted
on
the
fact
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
there
would
i
think
would
be
no
doubt
that
this
court
would
have
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal.
but
in
fact,
the
motion
was
granted
on
the
ground
that
in
the
later
the
facts
appearing
at
the
trial,
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
this
particular
defendant.
if
those
facts
had
appeared
in
and
agreed
statement
of
fact,
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
against
halseth
in
342
u.s.
would
support
the
jurisdiction.
here
the
facts
appeared
in
testimony
but
are
accepted
by
the
government
so,
that
there
is
a
basis
for
the
district
court's
statement
that
the
case
in
substance
arises
upon
an
aggrieved
statement
of
facts.
we
never
formally
agreed
to
them
but
we
don't
dispute
them.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
we
would
lose
our
right
to
appeal
if
we
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
dispute
them,
i
agree
and
we
don't.
we
don't.
in
this
situation,
we
have
concluded
not
without
difficulty
that
to
construe
the
criminal
appeals
act
as
precluding
appeal
of
the
decision
below
would
unwarrantedly
exalt
form
over
substance.
there
is
no
genuine
difference
between
this
case
and
one
in
which
the
nature
of
the
appellees
conscientious
objection
would
be
set
forth
in
the
indictment
itself
or
formerly
stipulated
to
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
we
think
too
that
the
decision
below
is
one
on
the
construction
of
section
12
(a)
of
the
selective
service
act.
less
clearly,
we
think
that
the
court's
decision
with
respect
to
section
6
(j)
comes
within
the
criminal
appeals
act.
you
have
to
go
through
6
(j)
to
get
to
12
(a)
to
--
in
order
to
make
it
a
construction
of
the
statute.
now,
there
are
two
other
clauses
of
the
criminal
appeals
act,
one,
relating
to
a
judgment
setting
aside
or
dismissing
any
indictment
or
information;
and
the
other
relating
to
a
--
the
sustaining
of
a
motion
in
bar
and
its
order
postponing
the
question
of
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
the
court
requested
the
parties
to
direct
their
attention
to
this
other
provisions
and
we‘ve
done
so
at
some
length
in
our
brief.
i
may
say
that
there
are
few
problems
which
reoccur
so
frequently
or
present
such
extreme
technical
difficulty
in
the
solicitor
general's
office
than
the
proper
construction
of
the
criminal
appeals
act,
you
had
the
jorn
case
last
week
which
was
a
problem.
there
are
also
other
provisions
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
in
the
act
relating
the
one
you
can
appeal
the
courts
of
appeals.
we
find
that
if
we
appeal
to
a
court
of
appeals,
they
transfer
to
the
supreme
court.
so
far,
we
haven't
had
much
problem
with
the
supreme
court
transferring
them
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
but
the
clauses
are
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
i
don't
believe
i
do.
in
jorn,
as
far
as
the
second
trial
is
concerned,
the
defendant
had
not
been
put
in
jeopardy
and
the
only
issue
is
whether
the
jeopardy
of
the
first
trial
is
wiped
out
or
not
so
as
to
make
the
appeal
available.
here
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
it
was
a
second
trial
under
the
same
indictment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
an
information,
yes
your
honor.
i
don't
recall
whether
the
amendment
was
made
following
the
first
trial
or
during
trial.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
now
the
clause
relating
the
motions
in
bar,
it
seems
to
us
rather
obviously
inapplicable
since
by
its
terms,
it's
available
only
when
the
defendant
has
not
been
put
in
jeopardy.
here,
the
appellee
has
clearly
been
put
in
jeopardy.
not
only
was
the
jury
empanelled
but
a
verdict
was
rendered
against
him.
moreover,
the
legislative
history
which
is
set
out
at
some
length
in
our
brief
shows
great
concern
on
the
part
of
responsible
senators
that
this
new
and
for
its
time
rather
bold
statute,
should
not
transgress
any
constitutional
limits,
particularly
with
respect
to
double
jeopardy.
i
just
do
not
see
how
we
can
get
any
helped
from
the
motion
in
the
bar
clause.
and
finally,
there
is
the
clause
relating
to
setting
aside
or
dismissing
any
indictment
or
information.
there
is
no
verbal
limitation
there
with
respect
to
jeopardy
and
a
literal
reading
of
the
provision
might
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
it
provides
a
basis
for
jurisdiction
here.
in
its
original
form,
this
clause
related
to
decisions
on
demur
and
such
decisions
would
be
rendered
before
or
nearly
this
before
jeopardy.
seven
months
following
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
this
court
indicated
that
the
provision
applied
and
i
quote
“to
judgments
rendered
before
the
moment
of
jeopardy
is
reach,”
and
that's
united
states
against
macdonald
in
207
u.s.
and
this
has
been
the
consistent
construction
of
the
provision
by
the
department
of
justice
over
a
period
of
more
than
60
years.
a
little
more
than
20
years
ago,
a
case
called
zisblatt
came
to
this
court
and
solicitor
general
perlman,
actually
had
came
through
the
court
of
appeals
and
was
certified
to
this
court.
solicitor
general
perlman
moved
that
the
appeal
to
be
dismissed
because
there
jeopardy
had
attached.
we
have
searched
through
the
files
to
try
to
find
some
greater
statement
of
the
reasons
but
have
not
found
that.
there
is
no
doubt
i
believe
that
it
was
the
expectation
of
the
legislators
while
the
bill
was
going
through
congress.
that
the
rulings
to
which
the
bill
related
would
occur
before
a
jury
was
sworn
except
for
decision
rendered
on
a
motion
and
arrest
of
judgment.
we're
not
prepared
to
dispute
this
contemporaneous
understanding
and
the
interpretation
of
the
act
at
which
has
obtained
since
1907.
it's
true
that
the
statute
has
been
amended
particularly
when
it
was
codified
in
1908
--
in
1948
but
the
reviser's
note
at
that
time
makes
it
plain
that
the
changes
then
made
were
editorial
only
and
were
not
intended
to
order
the
scope
of
review.
over
the
years,
the
department
of
justice
has
repeatedly
sought
to
get
the
statute
change,
i
might
say
modernized,
and
such
an
effort
is
pending
now.
but
there
have
been
no
changes
and
the
law
today
would
be
seemed
to
be
essentially
the
same
as
it
enacted
in
1907.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
it's
just
hard
to
get
things
through
congress
even
when
there
is
no
objection.
congressman
mcculloch,
the
raking
minority
member
of
the
house
judiciary
committee,
is
interested
in
this
now
and
we
hopes
that
he
will
make
some
progress
not
only
on
this,
but
on
the
statute
dealing
with
the
direct
appeals
and
interstate
commerce
commission
cases
and
from
three
judge
courts.
and
i
can
only
say
that
where
the
statute
passed
it
would
greatly
simplify
the
worked
of
the
solicitor
general's
office.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
how
about?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
you
might
have
more
petitions
to
certiorari
to
examine
or
to
review
at
courts
of
appeals.
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
or
not
because
the
existing
effect
is
that
a
great
many
cases
are
not
appealed
at
all
that
ought
to
be
appealed.
simply
because
we
feel
that
we
cannot
appropriately
bring
such
a
case
to
this
court
and
we
would
take
it
to
a
court
of
appeals.
and
would
very
likely
abide
by
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
such
i
think
jorn
is
a
clear
example.
i
--
we
were
sorry
to
bring
that
case
here
there
is
no
place
else
we
could
go.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
yes.
it
says
a
full
support
of
the
department
but
so
it
did
over
the
past
five
or
six
years
there
has
been
an
active
effort
to
get
it
done.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
believe
it's
gotten
to
a
committee.
we
did
refer
to
the
fact
in
our
brief
in
this
case
that
we
had
efforts
pending
but
i
don't
know
whether
anything
is
cited
now
or
not.
no,
i
don't
have
any.
i
--
i'm
quite
sure
that
there
is
no
committee
report.
i
suspect
that
the
only
thing
that
is
available
is
the
usual
letter
from
the
deputy
attorney
general
which
ordinarily
is
not
a
public
document.
on
this
basis,
our
position
is
that
the
only
basis
for
jurisdiction
here
is
the
arresting
a
judgment
clause
even
that's
a
little
shaky
as
i
tried
to
indicate.
but
for
the
reasons
i've
given
earlier,
our
submission
is
that
that
provision
can
appropriately
be
construed
to
support
this
court's
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal.
and
now,
i
turn
to
the
merits
in
the
sisson
case
assuming
that
i'm
validly
here.
as
i
have
already
indicated,
it
involves
nonreligious,
selective
objector.
judge
wyzanski
held
the
indictment
invalid
on
both
grounds
religious
and
selective.
we
think
he
was
wrong
on
both
grounds.
if
he
was
wrong
on
the
selective
objection
ground,
he
need
not
have
considered
the
nonreligious
character
of
the
objection.
as
i've
already
indicated,
we
rely
on
the
argument
in
the
welsh
case
so,
far
as
the
question
of
the
reference
to
religious
training
and
belief
in
the
statute
is
concerned.
and
that
leaves
for
consideration
here,
the
question
of
selective
conscientious
objection.
that
is
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
provision
which
congress
has
included
in
the
statute
that
exemption
will
be
allowed
when
the
registrant
and
i
quote
from
section
6
(j),
“his
conscientiously
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form.”
there's
no
suggestion
that
the
appellee
comes
within
the
terms
of
that
statute.
we
have
no
possible
question
of
statutory
construction
here
with
respect
to
that.
his
objection
is
to
the
vietnam
war.
he
asserts
that
he
is
not
a
pacifist,
thus,
unless
the
statute
is
in
some
way
invalid.
he
is
not
entitled
to
an
exemption
quite
without
regard
to
whether
his
objection
is
based
on
religious
training
and
belief.
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
i
allocated
the
religious
argument
to
the
welsh
case
and
the
selective
argument
back
to
this
case.
it
may
well
be
noted
in
the
first
place
that
the
appellee
has
not
been
indicted
for
failure
to
obey
and
order
to
go
to
vietnam.
he
is
being
prosecuted
for
failure
to
submit
to
induction
in
the
armed
forces.
thus,
the
court
undertook
to
excuse
a
deliberate
violation
of
the
law
on
the
basis
of
events
which
may
or
may
not
occur
in
the
future.
assuming
that
the
question
is
reached,
we
think
that
the
district
court
look
far
beyond
the
limits
of
the
proper
exercise
of
judicial
power
in
undertaking
decide
on
the
basis
of
its
balancing
of
the
considerations,
whether
an
individual's
conscientious
objection
to
a
particular
war,
gave
him
a
constitutional
right
to
disobey
an
act
of
congress.
in
our
view,
the
constitutional
grant
of
power
to
congress,
to
raise
and
maintain
armies
is
not
properly
subject
to
the
balancing
approach
applied
in
the
instant
case.
it
is
not
a
power
to
raise
and
maintain
armies
when
in
the
view
of
a
court
it
seems
that
on
a
whole
the
arguments
in
favor
of
it
outweigh
the
particular
objections
which
could
be
raised
by
an
individual
oppose
to
it.
the
weighing
of
considerations,
the
determination
of
necessity,
of
necessity
and
details
is
for
congress
and
not
the
courts.
congress
must
of
course
act
constitutionally,
but
it
is
not
the
problems
of
the
courts
to
decide
whether
a
particular
law
or
a
particular
foreign
policy
is
good
or
bad
or
whether
there
is
or
is
not
any
need
for
specified
numbers
of
man
in
a
particular
place
at
a
certain
time.
judges
are
not
the
person's
charge
with
the
responsibility
for
determining
the
national
need
for
military
manpower.
so
far
as
the
selective
conscientious
objector
is
concerned,
congress
has
made
no
discrimination
between
religious
and
nonreligious
motivations.
thus,
the
establishment
clause
has
no
bearing
on
the
issues
here
involved.
even
in
its
broadest
conceivable
construction
nor
can
this
case
properly
be
brought
within
the
free
exercise
clause.
religious
freedom
does
not
require
that
religious
scruples
be
recognized
as
justifying
disobedience
to
a
valid
law.
this
court
had
so
said
quite
clearly
in
hamilton
against
the
regents
in
293
u.s.
where
they
quoted
from
the
opinion
in
united
states
against
macintosh,
this
is
on
pages
44
and
45
of
our
brief,
and
then
there
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
45,
a
quotation
from
an
opinion
of
judge
augustus
hand
who
i
think,
i
may
appropriately
say
is
perhaps
my
favorite
federal
judge.
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
course
of
reasoning
resulting
in
a
conviction
under
particular
war
is
inexpedient
or
disastrous
and
conscientious
objection
to
participation
in
any
war
under
any
circumstances.
the
latter
not
the
former
may
be
the
basis
of
exemption
under
the
act
and
it
surely
never
occurred
to
judge
hand
that
there
was
any
legal
question
lying
behind
that
statement.
the
former
is
usually
a
political
objection.
while
the
latter
we
think
may
justly
be
regarded
as
a
response
of
the
individual
to
an
inward
matter.
call
it,
conscience
are
gone,
that
is
for
many
persons
at
the
present
time
the
equivalent
of
what
has
always
been
thought
a
religious
impulse.
only
if
the
free
exercise
clause
is
broadened
to
encompass
a
general
right
of
conscience
would
that
provision
be
useful
to
the
appellee.
and
there
are
extensive
arguments
in
the
briefs
of
amici
curiae
to
the
effect
that
the
first
amendment
does
command
a
general
right
of
conscience.
that
goes
beyond
but
the
amendment
says,
beyond
anything
that
this
court
has
ever
decided
and
it
seems
to
me
would
be
a
wholly
unwarranted
and
unjustified.
if
that
provision
was
given
such
sweeping
scope,
it
would
have
necessity
extend
beyond
the
selective
service
act
to
other
areas.
such
as
the
payments
of
taxes
or
to
people
have
conscientious
scruples
against
the
racial
equality.
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
are
such
people
whose
conscience
seems
perfectly
clear
on
that
matter
unless
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
held
to
have
pro
tanto
repeal
the
first
amendment
which
seems
a
curious
reversal
of
the
operation
of
those
provisions.
such
a
construction
of
the
first
amendment
is
without
precedent.
it
would
be
wholly
destructive
of
the
orderly
functioning
of
government.
and
it
would
undermine
the
essential
integrity
of
the
democratic
process.
it
is
true
of
course,
that
we
are
a
constitutional
government.
but
we
are
also
a
government
one
of
whose
great
principals
is
majority
rule.
the
acts
--
asked
by
the
elective
representatives
of
the
people
are
the
law.
they
are
subject
to
the
constitution
but
the
elective
representatives
of
the
people
make
the
political
decisions.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
no
mr.
justice.
that
is
essentially
the
argument
i
would
just
trying
to
make
that
pressing
--
pressing
the
first
amendment
to
establish
a
constitutional
right
of
free
conscience
could
not
be
limited
to
the
selective
service
act.
it
could
apply
to
all
across
the
board
anything
which
a
person
sincerely,
conscientiously
objects
to.
he
would
be
protected
in
his
objection
by
the
constitution
including
as
far
as
i
can
see
that
of
course
would
be
another
issue
which
would
have
to
argue
before
this
court
decided
and
the
court
might
find
some
way
to
make
a
distinction,
but
i
can't
make
the
distinction
now.
it
seems
to
me,
that
it
would
follow
that
particularly
since
flast
and
gordon
that
--
not
only
since
flast
and
gordon,
flast
and
cohen
but
if
the
premise
is
the
constitution
protects
people
in
conscientious
nonreligious
objections.
then
it
seems
to
me,
that
it
would
follow
that
a
citizen
could
refuse
to
pay
either
any
taxes
or
conceivably
some
kind
of
a
pro
rata
allocation
of
his
taxes,
insofar
as
they
or
perhaps,
we
would
have
to
set
up
separate
funds
and
this
taxes
could
go
into
a
fund
which
couldn't
be
used
for
defense
purposes
and
other
people's
taxes
would
go
into
the
defense
fund.
it
seems
to
me
that
pressing
the
general
language
of
the
first
amendment
that
far
would
be
pushing
it
to
a
dryly
logical
extreme.
and
finally,
we
contend
that
the
provision
made
by
congress
does
not
violate
the
fifth
amendment.
congress
could
rationally
distinguish
between
persons
oppose
to
war
in
any
form
and
those
whose
objections
extend
only
to
a
particular
war
or
situation.
this
is
not
a
question
of
sincerity
or
depth
of
conviction
but
opposition
to
a
particular
war
necessarily
involved
a
practical
and
essentially
political
judgment.
it
represents
the
individual's
personal
conclusion
that
the
policy
adopted
by
the
duly
elected
representatives
of
the
government
is
wrong
at
a
certain
time
in
relation
to
a
particular
area
of
operations.
those
who
oppose
participation
in
combat
in
any
form
do
not
make
the
same
type
of
immediate
political
judgment.
congress
may
validly
conclude
that
there
is
a
qualitative
difference
between
persons
who
is
beliefs
caused
them
to
opposed
participation
in
all
wars.
and
those
who
wish
to
reserved
the
right
to
choose
the
wars
in
which
they
will
fight.
except
for
the
court
below
and
judge
weigel
and
the
district
court
in
california
to
which
i've
made
reference.
all
of
the
courts
which
have
considered
the
matter
have
held
that
congress
may
validly
draw
a
distinction
between
those
who
oppose
all
wars
and
those
whose
objection
is
only
to
a
particular
war.
the
district
court
took
the
position
that
the
magnitude
of
an
individual's
conscientious
objection
is
not
presumably
lessened
because
his
beliefs
relate
to
a
particular
war.
but
it's
not
the
magnitude
or
the
sincerity
of
the
objection
which
gives
rise
to
the
distinction,
it
is
its
nature.
congress
could
reasonably
conclude
in
the
exercise
of
its
constitutionally
granted
power
to
raise
and
maintain
arms.
that
a
viable
government
cannot
allow
political
dissent
to
excuse
a
person
from
the
duties,
which
it
feels
it
must
impose
on
all
persons
of
the
same
class.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
the
statute
as
i
see
it
has
two
conditions
in
it
by
reason
of
religious
training
and
belief
which
sisson
doesn't
meet
by
his
own
assertion
is
constitutionally
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form.
and
sisson
by
his
own
assertion
does
not
meet
the
second
ground.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
his
reason
for
not
meeting
the
second
ground
is
religious
or
intellectual
and
philosophical.
now,
i
would
point
out
that
bond
case
decided
by
judge
weigel
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
be
--
then
you
would
not
need
to
decide
the
war
in
any
form
at
issue.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
would
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
hard
case,
which
fortunately
isn't
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
i
would
take
the
position
that
congress
can
draw
the
line
and
say
that
it
recognizes
religious
objection
only
when
it
is
based
on
opposition
to
war
in
any
form.
that
is
what
it
has
said
in
the
statute.
i
don't
know
any
reason
why
it
shouldn't
be
taken
at
face
value.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
recognized
that
if
that
case
came
and
in
some
ways
it's
almost
presented
in
the
bond
case.
the
bond
case
involved
a
sincere
catholic
who
following
certain
teachings
of
the
church
with
respect
to
just
and
unjust
wars,
concluded
that
this
was
unjust
war
and
that
he
could
not
participate
in
it
and
i
need
not
make
it
plain
that
i
have
no
question
whatever
about
the
sincerity
of
his
beliefs
or
about
the
sincerity
of
sisson's
beliefs.
it
is
our
position
that
this
is
a
judgment,
which
not
only
has
been
made
by
congress,
but
which
it
was
proper
for
congress
to
make.
we
have
not
only
the
first
amendment,
we
have
the
raise
and
maintain
armies
clause
and
congress
has
said
that
two
qualified
for
a
conscientious
objection,
exemption
you
must
be
opposed
to
war
in
any
form.
and
i
would
suppose
that
that
would
be
true,
even
though
congress
repealed
the
religious
training
and
belief
exception
which
it
seems
to
me
they
might
well
do
australian-great
britain
get
along
without
it
but
that's
a
matter
for
the
judgment
of
congress.
supposed
that
congress
did
eliminate
religious
training
and
belief
but
simply
said
as
the
australians
and
the
english
do
is
opposed
to
war
in
any
form.
it
seems
to
me,
it
would
not
help
the
claimant
to
say,
“i'm
not
opposed
to
war
at
any
form.
i
am
only
opposed
to
this
war
but
i
am
opposed
on
religious
grounds,”
and
brought
in
all
kinds
of
documentation
to
show
that
he
had
sound
religious
grounds
for
doing
it.
he
not
only
still
would
not
come
within
the
statute
but
it
would
be
my
submission
and
i
know
this
is
a
difficult
illusive
area.
but
it
would
be
my
submission
that
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
which
can't
properly
be
regarded
as
restricting
congress
in
making
that
judgment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
statute
now
says,
it's
in
the
welsh
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
now,
it's
on
page
3
of
the
sisson
brief
and
this
is
the
way
it
is
now.
nothing
contained
in
this
title
shall
be
construed
to
require
any
person
to
be
subject
to
combatant
training,
who
by
reason
of
religious
training
and
belief
is
conscientiously
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form
as
used
in
this
subsection
the
term
religious
training
and
belief
does
not
include
essentially
political,
sociological,
or
philosophical
views
or
a
merely
personal
moral
code.
now
that
in
line
is
not
only
a
thin
one
at
best
but
in
particular
cases
it
can
become
extraordinarily
thin.
but
it
seems
to
me,
that
there
is
room
for
a
line
there
that
congress
has
drawn
the
line.
in
this
case,
there's
no
problem
about
its
being
close
to
the
line
or
not.
it
is
asserted
that
he
does
not
base
his
claim
on
religious
training
and
relief.
and
in
the
sisson
case,
we
think
because
on
the
agreed
statement
of
facts
to
use
judge
wyzanski's
phrase,
“the
appellee
does
not
qualify
under
the
statute
either
by
reason
of
religious
training
or
relief
--
and
belief
or
by
reason
to
opposition
to
war
in
any
form.
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
reversed
and
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
that
court
and
here
mr.
chief
justice,
i
come
to
what
i
think
the
was
your
procedural
point
with
directions
to
enter
judgment
on
the
verdict.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
with
respect
to
the
jurisdictional
question,
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
me
yesterday
about
a
statute
which
has
been
opposed
in
congress.
it
is
referred
to
in
a
footnote
on
pages
15
and
particularly
on
page
16
of
our
brief
where
there
is
a
reference
to
the
congressional
record.
i
have
obtained
a
xerox
copy
of
that
page
with
the
congressional
record
and
also
a
copy
of
the
bill,
and
i
will
lodge
it
with
the
clerk
if
that
is
helpful
to
the
court.
the
proposed
statute
is
simple
and
i
think
clear.
it
provides
–-
it
would
supersede
the
first
seven
paragraphs
of
the
present
section
3731
and
would
substitute
“in
a
criminal
case,
an
appeal
by
the
united
states
shall
lie
to
a
court
of
appeals
from
a
judgment
or
order
of
a
district
court
dismissing
an
indictment
or
information,
or
terminating
a
prosecution
in
favor
of
a
defendant
as
to
any
one
or
more
counts,
except
that
no
appeal
shall
lie
from
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
provided
however
that
when
the
judgment
or
order
is
based
solely
on
a
determination
of
the
invalidity
of
an
act
of
congress,
the
appeal
shall
lie
directly
to
the
supreme
court.”
the
direct
appeal
would
only
be
in
the
case
of
the
invalidity
and
not
the
construction
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
would
be
no
such
provision
under
this
–-
yes,
i
suspect
there
would
be.
the
provision
for
transfer
would
still
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
would
still
stay
in
because
this
simply
is
a
substitute
for
the
first
seven
paragraphs
and
the
transfer
provisions
are
in
the
subsequent
paragraphs
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
so
that
if
this
court
concluded
that
no
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
was
involved,
it
could
transfer
it
to
a
court
of
appeals.
now
in
addition
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
present
statute
provides
for
transfer
both
ways,
from
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
-–
and
we
have
recently
filed
a
motion
for
a
transfer
of
a
case
from
this
stage
to
a
court
of
appeals,
which
i
regretted
having
to
file,
but
we
find
it
very
baffling
to
tell
in
some
cases
where
the
appeal
should
lie.
i
may
say
that
i
have
in
addition
prepared
xerox
copies
of
all
of
the
pages
of
the
congressional
record
back
in
1909
where
the
criminal
appeals
act
was
discussed,
and
i
will
lodge
that,
too,
with
the
court
because
it
might
be
convenient
in
examining
that.
i
will
lodge
that
with
the
clerk
because
it
might
be
convenient
in
examining
the
matter.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
where
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
of
congress
is
involved,
that's
the
only
question.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
the
department
felt
and
it
has
been
the
practice
of
congress
elsewhere
that
when
an
act
of
congress
is
held
unconstitutional,
that
is
an
important
question
which
ought
to
come
to
this
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
might
not
be
essentially
a
great
issue,
but
holding
an
act
of
congress
unconstitutional
is
a
great
issue.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
without
regard
to
the
time
factors
involved,
i
believe.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
it
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
it
can't
be
called
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment,
then
the
only
basis
for
appeal
would
be
to
call
it
a
motion
in
bar
where
the
statutes
expressly
says
when
the
defendant
has
not
been
put
in
jeopardy,
whether
it
would
or
would
not
be
a
motion
of
bar
is
a
point
upon
which
members
of
the
court
have
been
in
disagreement.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
our
position
is
that
he
has
been
placed
in
jeopardy.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
so
you
would
then
have
to
come
under
from
a
decision
or
judgment
setting
aside
or
dismissing
any
indictment
or
information,
or
any
count
thereof,
where
it
is
based
on
the
invalidity
or
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
rightly
or
wrongly,
we
don't
get
to
that
because
we
construe
that
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
history
as
also
involving
the
question
whether
the
defendant
has
been
put
in
jeopardy.
and
if
the
defendant
has
been
put
in
jeopardy,
we
not
only
so
construe
it
but
there's
a
long
practice
within
the
department
of
justice
at
least
accepted
by
this
court
to
the
same
effect.
now,
if
your
findings
of
fact
were
held,
were
made
before
the
empanelling
of
the
jury,
for
example,
if
the
court
said,
“i
am
greatly
troubled
by
the
validity
of
the
statute
in
this
case,
but
i'm
not
sure
about
the
facts
and
can
we
have
a
factual
hearing
which
will
have
evidence,”
and
he
then
finds
facts
from
which
he
concludes
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
no
jury
ever
having
been
in
panel,
then
i
would
suppose
that
the
first
clause
would
apply.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
then
we
are
unable
to
find
a
basis
for
jurisdiction
of
this
court
on
appeal.
if
this
court
can
find
it,
we
would
of
course
accept
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
not,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
would
be
no
appeal
anywhere.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
the
court
concludes
that
it
has
no
jurisdiction,
the
sole
basis
of
the
appeal
being
with
respect
to
the
court's
construction
and
determination
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
of
congress,
then
i
think
the
court
should
dismiss
the
appeal.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
leaves
the
decision
in
arrest
of
judgment
outstanding,
and
that
means
that
while
that
is
outstanding
and
no
one
can,
neither
this
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
can
upset
it,
that
it
would
not
be
possible
to
proceed
further
on
the
verdict
of
the
jury.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
with
respect,
i
think
not.
if
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction,
it
has
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
that
was
what
the
law
undoubtedly
was
in
all
respects
until
1909
and
all
that
we
can
say
is
that
congress
in
its
great
care
with
respect
to
the
double
jeopardy
simply
has
not
yet
made
available
an
appeal
in
that
case.
we
are
trying
to
persuade
the
congress
to
take
care
of
the
problem
and
i
hope
we
can.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that's
-–
we'll
keep
in
mind,
mr.
justice.
i
don't
–-
i
don't
-–
whether
that
would
be
good
policy
or
not,
i
don't
know.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
of
course
would
be
a
problem
but
offhand,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
answerable.
for
example,
suppose
there
had
been
a
petition
for
rehearing
filed
in
-–
before
judge
wyzanski
the
next
day,
one
reason
i'm
hesitant
is
i'm
not
familiar
with
what
the
rule
provisions
are
as
to
the
time
and
there
might
come
a
time
when
it
would
be
said
that
that
was
final
and
amounted
to
an
acquittal.
it
was
not
informed
an
acquittal.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
court
has
decided
that
it
has
jurisdiction
to
decide
whether
it
has
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice,
i
would
think
that
if
you
concluded
that
you
had
no
jurisdiction,
the
case
had
never
left
the
district
court,
and
you
would
not
have
power
to
send
it
back
with
any
directions
or
instructions
of
any
kind.
there
is
a
suggestion
here
in
the
argument
today
that
sisson's
objection
was
not
a
selective
one.
on
that,
i
would
simply
refer
to
page
151
of
the
appendix,
sisson's
testimony
which
the
government
accepts
as
part
of
the
agreed
statement
of
facts
here,
“i
refused
induction
because
i
believe
the
war
in
vietnam,
that
is
the
united
states
war
making
in
vietnam,
to
be
wrong.”
he
then
went
on
to
say,
“that
therefore,
i
felt
that
by
accepting
induction
that
even
though
i
might
not
be
sent
to
vietnam,
i
would
be
consenting
to
the
government's
waging
a
war
in
vietnam
and
i
believe
that
my
duty
not
to
consent
with
that
action
because
i
did
not
consent
in
my
own
mind.”
with
respect
to
the
power
of
congress
to
impose
a
peace
time
military
service,
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
go
off
in
a
country
which
did
not
have
conscription,
and
i
suppose
i
regarded
that
as
something
which
would
last
for
all
time.
it
would
be
fine
if
we
could
get
to
that
situation.
i
would
point
out
though
that
congress
enacted
the
modern
conscription
laws
in
1940,
which
was
technically
a
time
of
peace,
actually
a
time
of
peace
in
this
country.
that
the
problem
of
reenacting
that
statute
in
1941
also
came
up
in
a
time
of
peace
in
this
country,
and
it
would
be
rather
surprising
if
it
should
now
be
held
that
congress
had
no
power
to
pass
those
statutes.
let
me
conclude
by
simply
saying
that
our
professional
historian
friends
are
rather
skeptical
of
lawyer's
history.
they
refer
to
it
as
law
office
history
and
regarded
as
–-
to
use
an
appropriate
word,
as
highly
selective.
c.v.
wedgwood,
the
noted
historian,
wrote
one
time,
“we
know
the
end
before
we
consider
the
beginning
and
we
can
never
wholly
recapture
what
it
was
to
know
the
beginning
only.”
and
our
submission
here
is
that
the
court
should
not
find
in
history
something
that
surely
was
not
there.
our
predecessors
were
sensitive
to
the
first
amendment,
but
the
founders
accepted
the
exemption
from
military
service
for
members
of
the
peace
churches
without
any
question,
and
this
was
accepted
explicitly
in
the
acts
of
congress
for
130
years
right
through
the
first
world
war.
it
would
be
odd
indeed
if
the
invalidity
of
this
unbroken
practice
was
now
discovered
for
the
first
time
a
180
years
after
the
adoption
of
the
bill
of
rights.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
too
is
a
draft
case
raising
two
new
unrelated
and
difficult
problems.
in
a
third
aspect
it's
like
the
welsh
case
which
has
just
been
argued.
and
for
my
argument
on
the
question
relating
to
religious
training
and
belief,
i
rely
on
the
argument
in
the
case
just
concluded.
the
defendant
here
was
indicted
for
failing
to
report
for
induction.
there
was
a
trial
before
jury
at
which
the
defendant
testified.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty.
the
defendant
then
made
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment.
in
his
motion,
the
defendant
said
that
he
could
not
participate
in
the
vietnam
war
without
doing
violence
to
the
dictates
of
his
conscience.
and
he
further
stated
that,
he
cannot
qualify
as
a
conscientious
objector
within
the
meaning
of
the
military
selective
service
act
of
1967
because
he
is
not
a
pacifist.
and
in
any
event,
his
convictions
that
the
vietnam
war
is
illegal,
immoral,
and
unjust
are
not
based
on
religious
training
and
belief.
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
and
so
doing
it
referred
to
facts
which
had
appeared
at
the
trial
and
noted
that
particularly
the
defendants
own
testimony.
and
noted
that
“in
substance
the
case
arises
upon
an
agreed
statement
of
facts,”
that
appears
on
page
250
of
the
appendix.
i
can
state
that
none
of
the
facts
is
controvert.
we
do
not
dispute
that
the
appellee
was
sincerely
and
conscientiously
opposed
to
the
vietnam
conflict
based
on
his
moral
convictions,
educational
training,
extensive
reading
both
about
vietnam,
and
about
such
things
as
the
un
charter
and
the
nuremberg
trial.
as
i
have
indicated,
his
claim
is
selective
not
against
war
in
any
form
as
the
phrase
is
in
the
statute.
and
he
expressly
asserts
that
it
is
not
based
on
religious
training
and
belief.
in
this
situation,
the
district
court
held
that
the
appellee
had
a
valid
claim
to
be
constitutionally
exempted
from
combat
in
the
vietnam
type
of
situation.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
is
a
subject
to
which
i
am
about
to
address
my
argument.
it
is
the
--
i
was
trying
to
give
the
setting.
the
first
half
of
my
argument
is
devoted
to
jurisdiction
and
the
second
half
to
selective
conscientious
objection.
the
court
concluded
that
the
military
service
act
violated
the
free
exercise
in
due
process
clauses.
it
held
in
the
alternative
of
section
6
(j)
the
exemption
provision
violated
the
establishment
clause
and
that
it
unreasonably
discriminated
between
religious
and
non-religious
conscientious
objection.
from
this
decision,
the
united
states
took
this
appeal
purporting
to
act
under
the
second
clause
of
the
criminal
appeal
act
of
1907.
now,
found
in
title
18
of
the
united
states
code
section
3731,
the
relevant
passages
from
which
are
set
out
on
page
13
of
the
government's
brief.
and
now,
i
will
turn
to
the
jurisdictional
question
which
in
my
mind
is
a
very
close
question.
we
contend
that
there
is
jurisdiction
but
arguments
can
be
made
both
ways.
there's
no
doubt
that
there
was
a
trial
here
and
if
there
had
been
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
even
a
directive
verdict
of
not
guilty.
there
could
be
no
appeal
no
matter
what
error
of
law
was
made
by
the
trial
court.
an
illustration
of
that
is
found
in
the
case
decided
just
last
month
of
united
states
against
bond
which
is
set
out
in
appendix
to
one
of
the
briefs
filed
by
amici
curiae,
the
one
by
the
los
angeles
selective
service
law
panel.
in
the
bond
case,
judge
weigel
directed
the
verdict
for
the
defendant,
who
was
a
selective
conscientious
objector
based
on
religious
training
and
belief.
we
think
that
judge
weigel
was
wrong
as
the
matter
of
law
but
there's
nothing
we
can
do
about
it
and
we
have
of
course
taken
no
appeal.
the
difference
is
that
here
there
was
a
verdict
of
guilty
followed
by
a
motion
and
arrest
of
judgment
which
was
granted.
now,
if
judge
wyzanski
had
entered
an
order
saying,
having
examined
the
record
i
find
that
there
was
no
sufficient
evidence
to
submit
to
the
jury,
and
the
case
should
not
have
been
allowed
to
go
to
the
jury
and
accordingly,
i
direct
to
the
judgment
of
acquittal
be
entered.
i
think
we
would
be
so
close
to
the
situation
in
the
bond
case
that
we
couldn't
talked
about
it.
and
it
is
easy
i
think
to
say
that,
what
judge
wyzanski
did
is
not
different
in
substance
from
that
and
that
summarizes
the
difficulty
of
our
position
on
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
not
sure
mr.
justice.
the
judge
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
judge
has
decided
that
there
was
no
basis
in
law
for
the
verdict.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
not
in
the
appendix.
i
can't
tell
you
the
language.
the
opinion
is
here
but
the
actual
judgment
is
not
here.
i
discovered
to
my
surprise
last
night,
page
264,
enter
forthwith
this
decision
in
this
court's
order
granting
defendant
systems,
motion
and
arrest
of
judgment.
and
there
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
has
been
no
judgment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
250
--
250
is
the
only
place
that
i
can
find
it,
enter
forthwith
this
decision
and
this
court's
order,
granting
defendant
sisson's
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment.
now
that
is
in
arrest
of
judgment,
there
had
not
previously
been
any
judgment
and
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment,
not
in
arrest
of
the
execution
of
judgment
but
in
arrest
of
entering
judgment
as
i
interpret
it.
i
--
if
you're
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
verdict
is
in
a
historical
fact,
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
its
legal
effect
has
been
undermined
by
the
district
judge's
decision.
he
had
decided
that
it
is
not
a
proper
basis
to
found
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
conviction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
may
have
suggests
--
may
suggest
that
he
was
trying
to
preserve
a
situation
which
would
make
it
possible
for
us
to
appeal
to
this
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
--
that's
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
hate
to
be
arguing
against
myself
here
mr.
chief
justice,
but
he
has
left
the
verdict
stand
but
he's
pulled
all
the
foundation
out
from
under
so,
its
floats
in
space
i
guess.
it
is
no
longer
a
basis
for
entering
a
judgment
of
conviction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
from
--
it
is
from
a
judgment
or
order
in
arrest
of
judgment
which
is
the
express
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
you
don't
review
opinions
but
the
criminal
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
criminal
appeals
act
provides
that
there
is
an
appeal
to
this
court
from
a
decision
arresting
a
judgment
of
conviction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
from
a
decision
arresting
a
judgment
of
conviction
for
insufficient
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice.
i
think
the
decision
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
is
the
opinion
and
the
final
order
at
the
end,
beginning
on
page
248
and
concluding
on
page
264
of
the
appendix.
any
rate
that's
the,
not
only
the
only
order
there
is
but
that's
the
order
which
protects
system
and
from
which
the
government
is.
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
while
that
stands
sisson
completely
protected
and
that
is
the
order
from
which
the
government
is
seeking
to
give.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
was
a
motion
too
mr.
justice
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
which
was
--
which
was
denied
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
were
several
motions
before
a
trial,
all
of
which
were
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
this
motion,
the
arrest
of
judgment
to
some
extent
the
grounds
are
the
same
as
those
which
were
presented
in
motions
made
before
the
trial.
now
in
this
case,
if
the
motion
had
been
granted
on
the
fact
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
there
would
i
think
would
be
no
doubt
that
this
court
would
have
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal.
but
in
fact,
the
motion
was
granted
on
the
ground
that
in
the
later
the
facts
appearing
at
the
trial,
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
this
particular
defendant.
if
those
facts
had
appeared
in
and
agreed
statement
of
fact,
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
against
halseth
in
342
u.s.
would
support
the
jurisdiction.
here
the
facts
appeared
in
testimony
but
are
accepted
by
the
government
so,
that
there
is
a
basis
for
the
district
court's
statement
that
the
case
in
substance
arises
upon
an
aggrieved
statement
of
facts.
we
never
formally
agreed
to
them
but
we
don't
dispute
them.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
we
would
lose
our
right
to
appeal
if
we
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
dispute
them,
i
agree
and
we
don't.
we
don't.
in
this
situation,
we
have
concluded
not
without
difficulty
that
to
construe
the
criminal
appeals
act
as
precluding
appeal
of
the
decision
below
would
unwarrantedly
exalt
form
over
substance.
there
is
no
genuine
difference
between
this
case
and
one
in
which
the
nature
of
the
appellees
conscientious
objection
would
be
set
forth
in
the
indictment
itself
or
formerly
stipulated
to
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
we
think
too
that
the
decision
below
is
one
on
the
construction
of
section
12
(a)
of
the
selective
service
act.
less
clearly,
we
think
that
the
court's
decision
with
respect
to
section
6
(j)
comes
within
the
criminal
appeals
act.
you
have
to
go
through
6
(j)
to
get
to
12
(a)
to
--
in
order
to
make
it
a
construction
of
the
statute.
now,
there
are
two
other
clauses
of
the
criminal
appeals
act,
one,
relating
to
a
judgment
setting
aside
or
dismissing
any
indictment
or
information;
and
the
other
relating
to
a
--
the
sustaining
of
a
motion
in
bar
and
its
order
postponing
the
question
of
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
the
court
requested
the
parties
to
direct
their
attention
to
this
other
provisions
and
we‘ve
done
so
at
some
length
in
our
brief.
i
may
say
that
there
are
few
problems
which
reoccur
so
frequently
or
present
such
extreme
technical
difficulty
in
the
solicitor
general's
office
than
the
proper
construction
of
the
criminal
appeals
act,
you
had
the
jorn
case
last
week
which
was
a
problem.
there
are
also
other
provisions
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
in
the
act
relating
the
one
you
can
appeal
the
courts
of
appeals.
we
find
that
if
we
appeal
to
a
court
of
appeals,
they
transfer
to
the
supreme
court.
so
far,
we
haven't
had
much
problem
with
the
supreme
court
transferring
them
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
but
the
clauses
are
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
i
don't
believe
i
do.
in
jorn,
as
far
as
the
second
trial
is
concerned,
the
defendant
had
not
been
put
in
jeopardy
and
the
only
issue
is
whether
the
jeopardy
of
the
first
trial
is
wiped
out
or
not
so
as
to
make
the
appeal
available.
here
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
it
was
a
second
trial
under
the
same
indictment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
an
information,
yes
your
honor.
i
don't
recall
whether
the
amendment
was
made
following
the
first
trial
or
during
trial.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
now
the
clause
relating
the
motions
in
bar,
it
seems
to
us
rather
obviously
inapplicable
since
by
its
terms,
it's
available
only
when
the
defendant
has
not
been
put
in
jeopardy.
here,
the
appellee
has
clearly
been
put
in
jeopardy.
not
only
was
the
jury
empanelled
but
a
verdict
was
rendered
against
him.
moreover,
the
legislative
history
which
is
set
out
at
some
length
in
our
brief
shows
great
concern
on
the
part
of
responsible
senators
that
this
new
and
for
its
time
rather
bold
statute,
should
not
transgress
any
constitutional
limits,
particularly
with
respect
to
double
jeopardy.
i
just
do
not
see
how
we
can
get
any
helped
from
the
motion
in
the
bar
clause.
and
finally,
there
is
the
clause
relating
to
setting
aside
or
dismissing
any
indictment
or
information.
there
is
no
verbal
limitation
there
with
respect
to
jeopardy
and
a
literal
reading
of
the
provision
might
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
it
provides
a
basis
for
jurisdiction
here.
in
its
original
form,
this
clause
related
to
decisions
on
demur
and
such
decisions
would
be
rendered
before
or
nearly
this
before
jeopardy.
seven
months
following
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
this
court
indicated
that
the
provision
applied
and
i
quote
“to
judgments
rendered
before
the
moment
of
jeopardy
is
reach,”
and
that's
united
states
against
macdonald
in
207
u.s.
and
this
has
been
the
consistent
construction
of
the
provision
by
the
department
of
justice
over
a
period
of
more
than
60
years.
a
little
more
than
20
years
ago,
a
case
called
zisblatt
came
to
this
court
and
solicitor
general
perlman,
actually
had
came
through
the
court
of
appeals
and
was
certified
to
this
court.
solicitor
general
perlman
moved
that
the
appeal
to
be
dismissed
because
there
jeopardy
had
attached.
we
have
searched
through
the
files
to
try
to
find
some
greater
statement
of
the
reasons
but
have
not
found
that.
there
is
no
doubt
i
believe
that
it
was
the
expectation
of
the
legislators
while
the
bill
was
going
through
congress.
that
the
rulings
to
which
the
bill
related
would
occur
before
a
jury
was
sworn
except
for
decision
rendered
on
a
motion
and
arrest
of
judgment.
we're
not
prepared
to
dispute
this
contemporaneous
understanding
and
the
interpretation
of
the
act
at
which
has
obtained
since
1907.
it's
true
that
the
statute
has
been
amended
particularly
when
it
was
codified
in
1908
--
in
1948
but
the
reviser's
note
at
that
time
makes
it
plain
that
the
changes
then
made
were
editorial
only
and
were
not
intended
to
order
the
scope
of
review.
over
the
years,
the
department
of
justice
has
repeatedly
sought
to
get
the
statute
change,
i
might
say
modernized,
and
such
an
effort
is
pending
now.
but
there
have
been
no
changes
and
the
law
today
would
be
seemed
to
be
essentially
the
same
as
it
enacted
in
1907.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
it's
just
hard
to
get
things
through
congress
even
when
there
is
no
objection.
congressman
mcculloch,
the
raking
minority
member
of
the
house
judiciary
committee,
is
interested
in
this
now
and
we
hopes
that
he
will
make
some
progress
not
only
on
this,
but
on
the
statute
dealing
with
the
direct
appeals
and
interstate
commerce
commission
cases
and
from
three
judge
courts.
and
i
can
only
say
that
where
the
statute
passed
it
would
greatly
simplify
the
worked
of
the
solicitor
general's
office.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
how
about?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
you
might
have
more
petitions
to
certiorari
to
examine
or
to
review
at
courts
of
appeals.
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
or
not
because
the
existing
effect
is
that
a
great
many
cases
are
not
appealed
at
all
that
ought
to
be
appealed.
simply
because
we
feel
that
we
cannot
appropriately
bring
such
a
case
to
this
court
and
we
would
take
it
to
a
court
of
appeals.
and
would
very
likely
abide
by
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
such
i
think
jorn
is
a
clear
example.
i
--
we
were
sorry
to
bring
that
case
here
there
is
no
place
else
we
could
go.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
yes.
it
says
a
full
support
of
the
department
but
so
it
did
over
the
past
five
or
six
years
there
has
been
an
active
effort
to
get
it
done.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
believe
it's
gotten
to
a
committee.
we
did
refer
to
the
fact
in
our
brief
in
this
case
that
we
had
efforts
pending
but
i
don't
know
whether
anything
is
cited
now
or
not.
no,
i
don't
have
any.
i
--
i'm
quite
sure
that
there
is
no
committee
report.
i
suspect
that
the
only
thing
that
is
available
is
the
usual
letter
from
the
deputy
attorney
general
which
ordinarily
is
not
a
public
document.
on
this
basis,
our
position
is
that
the
only
basis
for
jurisdiction
here
is
the
arresting
a
judgment
clause
even
that's
a
little
shaky
as
i
tried
to
indicate.
but
for
the
reasons
i've
given
earlier,
our
submission
is
that
that
provision
can
appropriately
be
construed
to
support
this
court's
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal.
and
now,
i
turn
to
the
merits
in
the
sisson
case
assuming
that
i'm
validly
here.
as
i
have
already
indicated,
it
involves
nonreligious,
selective
objector.
judge
wyzanski
held
the
indictment
invalid
on
both
grounds
religious
and
selective.
we
think
he
was
wrong
on
both
grounds.
if
he
was
wrong
on
the
selective
objection
ground,
he
need
not
have
considered
the
nonreligious
character
of
the
objection.
as
i've
already
indicated,
we
rely
on
the
argument
in
the
welsh
case
so,
far
as
the
question
of
the
reference
to
religious
training
and
belief
in
the
statute
is
concerned.
and
that
leaves
for
consideration
here,
the
question
of
selective
conscientious
objection.
that
is
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
provision
which
congress
has
included
in
the
statute
that
exemption
will
be
allowed
when
the
registrant
and
i
quote
from
section
6
(j),
“his
conscientiously
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form.”
there's
no
suggestion
that
the
appellee
comes
within
the
terms
of
that
statute.
we
have
no
possible
question
of
statutory
construction
here
with
respect
to
that.
his
objection
is
to
the
vietnam
war.
he
asserts
that
he
is
not
a
pacifist,
thus,
unless
the
statute
is
in
some
way
invalid.
he
is
not
entitled
to
an
exemption
quite
without
regard
to
whether
his
objection
is
based
on
religious
training
and
belief.
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
i
allocated
the
religious
argument
to
the
welsh
case
and
the
selective
argument
back
to
this
case.
it
may
well
be
noted
in
the
first
place
that
the
appellee
has
not
been
indicted
for
failure
to
obey
and
order
to
go
to
vietnam.
he
is
being
prosecuted
for
failure
to
submit
to
induction
in
the
armed
forces.
thus,
the
court
undertook
to
excuse
a
deliberate
violation
of
the
law
on
the
basis
of
events
which
may
or
may
not
occur
in
the
future.
assuming
that
the
question
is
reached,
we
think
that
the
district
court
look
far
beyond
the
limits
of
the
proper
exercise
of
judicial
power
in
undertaking
decide
on
the
basis
of
its
balancing
of
the
considerations,
whether
an
individual's
conscientious
objection
to
a
particular
war,
gave
him
a
constitutional
right
to
disobey
an
act
of
congress.
in
our
view,
the
constitutional
grant
of
power
to
congress,
to
raise
and
maintain
armies
is
not
properly
subject
to
the
balancing
approach
applied
in
the
instant
case.
it
is
not
a
power
to
raise
and
maintain
armies
when
in
the
view
of
a
court
it
seems
that
on
a
whole
the
arguments
in
favor
of
it
outweigh
the
particular
objections
which
could
be
raised
by
an
individual
oppose
to
it.
the
weighing
of
considerations,
the
determination
of
necessity,
of
necessity
and
details
is
for
congress
and
not
the
courts.
congress
must
of
course
act
constitutionally,
but
it
is
not
the
problems
of
the
courts
to
decide
whether
a
particular
law
or
a
particular
foreign
policy
is
good
or
bad
or
whether
there
is
or
is
not
any
need
for
specified
numbers
of
man
in
a
particular
place
at
a
certain
time.
judges
are
not
the
person's
charge
with
the
responsibility
for
determining
the
national
need
for
military
manpower.
so
far
as
the
selective
conscientious
objector
is
concerned,
congress
has
made
no
discrimination
between
religious
and
nonreligious
motivations.
thus,
the
establishment
clause
has
no
bearing
on
the
issues
here
involved.
even
in
its
broadest
conceivable
construction
nor
can
this
case
properly
be
brought
within
the
free
exercise
clause.
religious
freedom
does
not
require
that
religious
scruples
be
recognized
as
justifying
disobedience
to
a
valid
law.
this
court
had
so
said
quite
clearly
in
hamilton
against
the
regents
in
293
u.s.
where
they
quoted
from
the
opinion
in
united
states
against
macintosh,
this
is
on
pages
44
and
45
of
our
brief,
and
then
there
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
45,
a
quotation
from
an
opinion
of
judge
augustus
hand
who
i
think,
i
may
appropriately
say
is
perhaps
my
favorite
federal
judge.
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
course
of
reasoning
resulting
in
a
conviction
under
particular
war
is
inexpedient
or
disastrous
and
conscientious
objection
to
participation
in
any
war
under
any
circumstances.
the
latter
not
the
former
may
be
the
basis
of
exemption
under
the
act
and
it
surely
never
occurred
to
judge
hand
that
there
was
any
legal
question
lying
behind
that
statement.
the
former
is
usually
a
political
objection.
while
the
latter
we
think
may
justly
be
regarded
as
a
response
of
the
individual
to
an
inward
matter.
call
it,
conscience
are
gone,
that
is
for
many
persons
at
the
present
time
the
equivalent
of
what
has
always
been
thought
a
religious
impulse.
only
if
the
free
exercise
clause
is
broadened
to
encompass
a
general
right
of
conscience
would
that
provision
be
useful
to
the
appellee.
and
there
are
extensive
arguments
in
the
briefs
of
amici
curiae
to
the
effect
that
the
first
amendment
does
command
a
general
right
of
conscience.
that
goes
beyond
but
the
amendment
says,
beyond
anything
that
this
court
has
ever
decided
and
it
seems
to
me
would
be
a
wholly
unwarranted
and
unjustified.
if
that
provision
was
given
such
sweeping
scope,
it
would
have
necessity
extend
beyond
the
selective
service
act
to
other
areas.
such
as
the
payments
of
taxes
or
to
people
have
conscientious
scruples
against
the
racial
equality.
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
are
such
people
whose
conscience
seems
perfectly
clear
on
that
matter
unless
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
held
to
have
pro
tanto
repeal
the
first
amendment
which
seems
a
curious
reversal
of
the
operation
of
those
provisions.
such
a
construction
of
the
first
amendment
is
without
precedent.
it
would
be
wholly
destructive
of
the
orderly
functioning
of
government.
and
it
would
undermine
the
essential
integrity
of
the
democratic
process.
it
is
true
of
course,
that
we
are
a
constitutional
government.
but
we
are
also
a
government
one
of
whose
great
principals
is
majority
rule.
the
acts
--
asked
by
the
elective
representatives
of
the
people
are
the
law.
they
are
subject
to
the
constitution
but
the
elective
representatives
of
the
people
make
the
political
decisions.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
no
mr.
justice.
that
is
essentially
the
argument
i
would
just
trying
to
make
that
pressing
--
pressing
the
first
amendment
to
establish
a
constitutional
right
of
free
conscience
could
not
be
limited
to
the
selective
service
act.
it
could
apply
to
all
across
the
board
anything
which
a
person
sincerely,
conscientiously
objects
to.
he
would
be
protected
in
his
objection
by
the
constitution
including
as
far
as
i
can
see
that
of
course
would
be
another
issue
which
would
have
to
argue
before
this
court
decided
and
the
court
might
find
some
way
to
make
a
distinction,
but
i
can't
make
the
distinction
now.
it
seems
to
me,
that
it
would
follow
that
particularly
since
flast
and
gordon
that
--
not
only
since
flast
and
gordon,
flast
and
cohen
but
if
the
premise
is
the
constitution
protects
people
in
conscientious
nonreligious
objections.
then
it
seems
to
me,
that
it
would
follow
that
a
citizen
could
refuse
to
pay
either
any
taxes
or
conceivably
some
kind
of
a
pro
rata
allocation
of
his
taxes,
insofar
as
they
or
perhaps,
we
would
have
to
set
up
separate
funds
and
this
taxes
could
go
into
a
fund
which
couldn't
be
used
for
defense
purposes
and
other
people's
taxes
would
go
into
the
defense
fund.
it
seems
to
me
that
pressing
the
general
language
of
the
first
amendment
that
far
would
be
pushing
it
to
a
dryly
logical
extreme.
and
finally,
we
contend
that
the
provision
made
by
congress
does
not
violate
the
fifth
amendment.
congress
could
rationally
distinguish
between
persons
oppose
to
war
in
any
form
and
those
whose
objections
extend
only
to
a
particular
war
or
situation.
this
is
not
a
question
of
sincerity
or
depth
of
conviction
but
opposition
to
a
particular
war
necessarily
involved
a
practical
and
essentially
political
judgment.
it
represents
the
individual's
personal
conclusion
that
the
policy
adopted
by
the
duly
elected
representatives
of
the
government
is
wrong
at
a
certain
time
in
relation
to
a
particular
area
of
operations.
those
who
oppose
participation
in
combat
in
any
form
do
not
make
the
same
type
of
immediate
political
judgment.
congress
may
validly
conclude
that
there
is
a
qualitative
difference
between
persons
who
is
beliefs
caused
them
to
opposed
participation
in
all
wars.
and
those
who
wish
to
reserved
the
right
to
choose
the
wars
in
which
they
will
fight.
except
for
the
court
below
and
judge
weigel
and
the
district
court
in
california
to
which
i've
made
reference.
all
of
the
courts
which
have
considered
the
matter
have
held
that
congress
may
validly
draw
a
distinction
between
those
who
oppose
all
wars
and
those
whose
objection
is
only
to
a
particular
war.
the
district
court
took
the
position
that
the
magnitude
of
an
individual's
conscientious
objection
is
not
presumably
lessened
because
his
beliefs
relate
to
a
particular
war.
but
it's
not
the
magnitude
or
the
sincerity
of
the
objection
which
gives
rise
to
the
distinction,
it
is
its
nature.
congress
could
reasonably
conclude
in
the
exercise
of
its
constitutionally
granted
power
to
raise
and
maintain
arms.
that
a
viable
government
cannot
allow
political
dissent
to
excuse
a
person
from
the
duties,
which
it
feels
it
must
impose
on
all
persons
of
the
same
class.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
the
statute
as
i
see
it
has
two
conditions
in
it
by
reason
of
religious
training
and
belief
which
sisson
doesn't
meet
by
his
own
assertion
is
constitutionally
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form.
and
sisson
by
his
own
assertion
does
not
meet
the
second
ground.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
his
reason
for
not
meeting
the
second
ground
is
religious
or
intellectual
and
philosophical.
now,
i
would
point
out
that
bond
case
decided
by
judge
weigel
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
be
--
then
you
would
not
need
to
decide
the
war
in
any
form
at
issue.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
would
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
hard
case,
which
fortunately
isn't
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
i
would
take
the
position
that
congress
can
draw
the
line
and
say
that
it
recognizes
religious
objection
only
when
it
is
based
on
opposition
to
war
in
any
form.
that
is
what
it
has
said
in
the
statute.
i
don't
know
any
reason
why
it
shouldn't
be
taken
at
face
value.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
recognized
that
if
that
case
came
and
in
some
ways
it's
almost
presented
in
the
bond
case.
the
bond
case
involved
a
sincere
catholic
who
following
certain
teachings
of
the
church
with
respect
to
just
and
unjust
wars,
concluded
that
this
was
unjust
war
and
that
he
could
not
participate
in
it
and
i
need
not
make
it
plain
that
i
have
no
question
whatever
about
the
sincerity
of
his
beliefs
or
about
the
sincerity
of
sisson's
beliefs.
it
is
our
position
that
this
is
a
judgment,
which
not
only
has
been
made
by
congress,
but
which
it
was
proper
for
congress
to
make.
we
have
not
only
the
first
amendment,
we
have
the
raise
and
maintain
armies
clause
and
congress
has
said
that
two
qualified
for
a
conscientious
objection,
exemption
you
must
be
opposed
to
war
in
any
form.
and
i
would
suppose
that
that
would
be
true,
even
though
congress
repealed
the
religious
training
and
belief
exception
which
it
seems
to
me
they
might
well
do
australian-great
britain
get
along
without
it
but
that's
a
matter
for
the
judgment
of
congress.
supposed
that
congress
did
eliminate
religious
training
and
belief
but
simply
said
as
the
australians
and
the
english
do
is
opposed
to
war
in
any
form.
it
seems
to
me,
it
would
not
help
the
claimant
to
say,
“i'm
not
opposed
to
war
at
any
form.
i
am
only
opposed
to
this
war
but
i
am
opposed
on
religious
grounds,”
and
brought
in
all
kinds
of
documentation
to
show
that
he
had
sound
religious
grounds
for
doing
it.
he
not
only
still
would
not
come
within
the
statute
but
it
would
be
my
submission
and
i
know
this
is
a
difficult
illusive
area.
but
it
would
be
my
submission
that
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
which
can't
properly
be
regarded
as
restricting
congress
in
making
that
judgment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
statute
now
says,
it's
in
the
welsh
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
now,
it's
on
page
3
of
the
sisson
brief
and
this
is
the
way
it
is
now.
nothing
contained
in
this
title
shall
be
construed
to
require
any
person
to
be
subject
to
combatant
training,
who
by
reason
of
religious
training
and
belief
is
conscientiously
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form
as
used
in
this
subsection
the
term
religious
training
and
belief
does
not
include
essentially
political,
sociological,
or
philosophical
views
or
a
merely
personal
moral
code.
now
that
in
line
is
not
only
a
thin
one
at
best
but
in
particular
cases
it
can
become
extraordinarily
thin.
but
it
seems
to
me,
that
there
is
room
for
a
line
there
that
congress
has
drawn
the
line.
in
this
case,
there's
no
problem
about
its
being
close
to
the
line
or
not.
it
is
asserted
that
he
does
not
base
his
claim
on
religious
training
and
relief.
and
in
the
sisson
case,
we
think
because
on
the
agreed
statement
of
facts
to
use
judge
wyzanski's
phrase,
“the
appellee
does
not
qualify
under
the
statute
either
by
reason
of
religious
training
or
relief
--
and
belief
or
by
reason
to
opposition
to
war
in
any
form.
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
reversed
and
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
that
court
and
here
mr.
chief
justice,
i
come
to
what
i
think
the
was
your
procedural
point
with
directions
to
enter
judgment
on
the
verdict.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
with
respect
to
the
jurisdictional
question,
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
me
yesterday
about
a
statute
which
has
been
opposed
in
congress.
it
is
referred
to
in
a
footnote
on
pages
15
and
particularly
on
page
16
of
our
brief
where
there
is
a
reference
to
the
congressional
record.
i
have
obtained
a
xerox
copy
of
that
page
with
the
congressional
record
and
also
a
copy
of
the
bill,
and
i
will
lodge
it
with
the
clerk
if
that
is
helpful
to
the
court.
the
proposed
statute
is
simple
and
i
think
clear.
it
provides
–-
it
would
supersede
the
first
seven
paragraphs
of
the
present
section
3731
and
would
substitute
“in
a
criminal
case,
an
appeal
by
the
united
states
shall
lie
to
a
court
of
appeals
from
a
judgment
or
order
of
a
district
court
dismissing
an
indictment
or
information,
or
terminating
a
prosecution
in
favor
of
a
defendant
as
to
any
one
or
more
counts,
except
that
no
appeal
shall
lie
from
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
provided
however
that
when
the
judgment
or
order
is
based
solely
on
a
determination
of
the
invalidity
of
an
act
of
congress,
the
appeal
shall
lie
directly
to
the
supreme
court.”
the
direct
appeal
would
only
be
in
the
case
of
the
invalidity
and
not
the
construction
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
would
be
no
such
provision
under
this
–-
yes,
i
suspect
there
would
be.
the
provision
for
transfer
would
still
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
would
still
stay
in
because
this
simply
is
a
substitute
for
the
first
seven
paragraphs
and
the
transfer
provisions
are
in
the
subsequent
paragraphs
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
so
that
if
this
court
concluded
that
no
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
was
involved,
it
could
transfer
it
to
a
court
of
appeals.
now
in
addition
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
present
statute
provides
for
transfer
both
ways,
from
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
-–
and
we
have
recently
filed
a
motion
for
a
transfer
of
a
case
from
this
stage
to
a
court
of
appeals,
which
i
regretted
having
to
file,
but
we
find
it
very
baffling
to
tell
in
some
cases
where
the
appeal
should
lie.
i
may
say
that
i
have
in
addition
prepared
xerox
copies
of
all
of
the
pages
of
the
congressional
record
back
in
1909
where
the
criminal
appeals
act
was
discussed,
and
i
will
lodge
that,
too,
with
the
court
because
it
might
be
convenient
in
examining
that.
i
will
lodge
that
with
the
clerk
because
it
might
be
convenient
in
examining
the
matter.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
where
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
of
congress
is
involved,
that's
the
only
question.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
the
department
felt
and
it
has
been
the
practice
of
congress
elsewhere
that
when
an
act
of
congress
is
held
unconstitutional,
that
is
an
important
question
which
ought
to
come
to
this
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
might
not
be
essentially
a
great
issue,
but
holding
an
act
of
congress
unconstitutional
is
a
great
issue.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
without
regard
to
the
time
factors
involved,
i
believe.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
it
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
it
can't
be
called
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment,
then
the
only
basis
for
appeal
would
be
to
call
it
a
motion
in
bar
where
the
statutes
expressly
says
when
the
defendant
has
not
been
put
in
jeopardy,
whether
it
would
or
would
not
be
a
motion
of
bar
is
a
point
upon
which
members
of
the
court
have
been
in
disagreement.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
our
position
is
that
he
has
been
placed
in
jeopardy.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
so
you
would
then
have
to
come
under
from
a
decision
or
judgment
setting
aside
or
dismissing
any
indictment
or
information,
or
any
count
thereof,
where
it
is
based
on
the
invalidity
or
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
rightly
or
wrongly,
we
don't
get
to
that
because
we
construe
that
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
history
as
also
involving
the
question
whether
the
defendant
has
been
put
in
jeopardy.
and
if
the
defendant
has
been
put
in
jeopardy,
we
not
only
so
construe
it
but
there's
a
long
practice
within
the
department
of
justice
at
least
accepted
by
this
court
to
the
same
effect.
now,
if
your
findings
of
fact
were
held,
were
made
before
the
empanelling
of
the
jury,
for
example,
if
the
court
said,
“i
am
greatly
troubled
by
the
validity
of
the
statute
in
this
case,
but
i'm
not
sure
about
the
facts
and
can
we
have
a
factual
hearing
which
will
have
evidence,”
and
he
then
finds
facts
from
which
he
concludes
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
no
jury
ever
having
been
in
panel,
then
i
would
suppose
that
the
first
clause
would
apply.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
then
we
are
unable
to
find
a
basis
for
jurisdiction
of
this
court
on
appeal.
if
this
court
can
find
it,
we
would
of
course
accept
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
not,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
would
be
no
appeal
anywhere.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
the
court
concludes
that
it
has
no
jurisdiction,
the
sole
basis
of
the
appeal
being
with
respect
to
the
court's
construction
and
determination
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
of
congress,
then
i
think
the
court
should
dismiss
the
appeal.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
leaves
the
decision
in
arrest
of
judgment
outstanding,
and
that
means
that
while
that
is
outstanding
and
no
one
can,
neither
this
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
can
upset
it,
that
it
would
not
be
possible
to
proceed
further
on
the
verdict
of
the
jury.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
with
respect,
i
think
not.
if
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction,
it
has
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
that
was
what
the
law
undoubtedly
was
in
all
respects
until
1909
and
all
that
we
can
say
is
that
congress
in
its
great
care
with
respect
to
the
double
jeopardy
simply
has
not
yet
made
available
an
appeal
in
that
case.
we
are
trying
to
persuade
the
congress
to
take
care
of
the
problem
and
i
hope
we
can.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that's
-–
we'll
keep
in
mind,
mr.
justice.
i
don't
–-
i
don't
-–
whether
that
would
be
good
policy
or
not,
i
don't
know.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
of
course
would
be
a
problem
but
offhand,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
answerable.
for
example,
suppose
there
had
been
a
petition
for
rehearing
filed
in
-–
before
judge
wyzanski
the
next
day,
one
reason
i'm
hesitant
is
i'm
not
familiar
with
what
the
rule
provisions
are
as
to
the
time
and
there
might
come
a
time
when
it
would
be
said
that
that
was
final
and
amounted
to
an
acquittal.
it
was
not
informed
an
acquittal.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
court
has
decided
that
it
has
jurisdiction
to
decide
whether
it
has
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice,
i
would
think
that
if
you
concluded
that
you
had
no
jurisdiction,
the
case
had
never
left
the
district
court,
and
you
would
not
have
power
to
send
it
back
with
any
directions
or
instructions
of
any
kind.
there
is
a
suggestion
here
in
the
argument
today
that
sisson's
objection
was
not
a
selective
one.
on
that,
i
would
simply
refer
to
page
151
of
the
appendix,
sisson's
testimony
which
the
government
accepts
as
part
of
the
agreed
statement
of
facts
here,
“i
refused
induction
because
i
believe
the
war
in
vietnam,
that
is
the
united
states
war
making
in
vietnam,
to
be
wrong.”
he
then
went
on
to
say,
“that
therefore,
i
felt
that
by
accepting
induction
that
even
though
i
might
not
be
sent
to
vietnam,
i
would
be
consenting
to
the
government's
waging
a
war
in
vietnam
and
i
believe
that
my
duty
not
to
consent
with
that
action
because
i
did
not
consent
in
my
own
mind.”
with
respect
to
the
power
of
congress
to
impose
a
peace
time
military
service,
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
go
off
in
a
country
which
did
not
have
conscription,
and
i
suppose
i
regarded
that
as
something
which
would
last
for
all
time.
it
would
be
fine
if
we
could
get
to
that
situation.
i
would
point
out
though
that
congress
enacted
the
modern
conscription
laws
in
1940,
which
was
technically
a
time
of
peace,
actually
a
time
of
peace
in
this
country.
that
the
problem
of
reenacting
that
statute
in
1941
also
came
up
in
a
time
of
peace
in
this
country,
and
it
would
be
rather
surprising
if
it
should
now
be
held
that
congress
had
no
power
to
pass
those
statutes.
let
me
conclude
by
simply
saying
that
our
professional
historian
friends
are
rather
skeptical
of
lawyer's
history.
they
refer
to
it
as
law
office
history
and
regarded
as
–-
to
use
an
appropriate
word,
as
highly
selective.
c.v.
wedgwood,
the
noted
historian,
wrote
one
time,
“we
know
the
end
before
we
consider
the
beginning
and
we
can
never
wholly
recapture
what
it
was
to
know
the
beginning
only.”
and
our
submission
here
is
that
the
court
should
not
find
in
history
something
that
surely
was
not
there.
our
predecessors
were
sensitive
to
the
first
amendment,
but
the
founders
accepted
the
exemption
from
military
service
for
members
of
the
peace
churches
without
any
question,
and
this
was
accepted
explicitly
in
the
acts
of
congress
for
130
years
right
through
the
first
world
war.
it
would
be
odd
indeed
if
the
invalidity
of
this
unbroken
practice
was
now
discovered
for
the
first
time
a
180
years
after
the
adoption
of
the
bill
of
rights.
