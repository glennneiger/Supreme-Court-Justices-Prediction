unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
the
mr.
solicitor
general.
this
is
an
appeal
isn't
it,
a
direct
appeal?
unknown
speaker
it
must
be
from
the
judgment,
must
have
not?
we
--
i
thought
you
said
--
unknown
speaker
well
my
point
is,
i
gather
we've
often
said
that
we
don't
review
opinions
here
we
review
judgments.
unknown
speaker
i
know
a
decision.
what's
a
decision
--
what
forms
of
decision
take
to
purposes
of
appeal?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
ask
again.
i
ask
again,
what
form
does
a
decision
take?
do
we
have
another
jurisdictional
question
here?
will
we
have
any
appeal
here
at
all?
unknown
speaker
the
opinion?
unknown
speaker
still
is?
unknown
speaker
but
may
i
ask
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
see
any
similarity
in
the
problem
here
to
that
in
jorn?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
strictly
speaking
and
that
was
only
a
second
stage
not
a
second
trial
but
a
second
stage
on
the
same
proceeding
in
jorn.
unknown
speaker
under
an
amended
information?
unknown
speaker
after
the
first
stage
of
the
proceeding
in
that
was
met.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
mr.
solicitor
is
justice
sparksman
--
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
documentation
(inaudible),
what
i
mean
are
they
significant
to
the
committee?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor,
are
you
arguing
that
even
if
assistance
claims
were
religious,
the
government
could
nevertheless
deny
him
an
exemption
because
it
doesn't
oppose
all
wars?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
have
to
reach
that
point
here
in
this
case
because
i
gather
you
claim
his
position
isn't
religious
anyway?
unknown
speaker
but
if
we,
if
we
said
that
his
position
was
in
religious
in
any
event
that's
the
end
of
it
--
unknown
speaker
well
--
unknown
speaker
not
according
to
it,
assuming
that
much
jurisdiction
at
least
and
assuming
on
the
underlying
question,
the
conclusion
is
there
is
no
direct
review
of
the
case,
is
that
limited
jurisdiction
it
would
have.
it
was
from
our
--
number
2106,
as
in
sending
this
back
to
the
district
court?
let's
just
assume
that
our
--
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
the
mr.
solicitor
general.
this
is
an
appeal
isn't
it,
a
direct
appeal?

i
know
a

what's
a
decision
--
what
forms
of
decision
take
to
purposes
of
appeal?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
ask
again.
i
ask

what

a
