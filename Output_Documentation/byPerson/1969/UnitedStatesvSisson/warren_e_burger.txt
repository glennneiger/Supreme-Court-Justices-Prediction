we

take
number
305,
united
states
against

mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there's
one
important
difference
though
in
that
the
verdict
and
judgments
stands
now,
does
it
not?
in
your
first
illustration
a
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
that
there
would
be
no
verdict
any
longer
but
the
verdict
still
stands
here,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
was
--
what
was
the
language
of
his
order
was?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
you
--
this
is
the
language
i
had
in
mind.
it's
in
arrest
of
judgment.
he
is
acknowledging
the
existence
of
the
judgment
which
presupposes
that
it
rests
and
turn
upon
a
verdict
and
he
hasn't
done
--
he
hasn't
expressed
or
articulated
any
idea
of
setting
aside
that
verdict
nor
does
he
vacate
the
judgment
he
said,
he
arrests
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
language
you
read
again?
excuse
me,
i'm
looking
for
it
in
the
appendix
but
i
don't
find
it
precise
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
puzzles
me
a
little
bit.
i
did
not
know
whether
he
--
from
this
language
was
arresting
a
judgment,
the
execution
of
a
judgment
entered,
or
arresting
the
entry
of
the
judgment
based
on
the
verdict.
but
in
either
case
the
verdict
stands,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
--
its
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
when
a
sophisticated,
highly
experienced
district
judge
makes
the
choice
between
a
judgments
entering
judgment
notwithstanding
a
verdict
in
this
posture,
and
the
action
which
he
did
take.
does
that
suggest
anything
to
--
should
that
suggest
anything
to
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
a
--
that's
among
other
things,
one
of
the
incidental
factors
which
occurred
to
me
but
in
so
doing,
he
has
left
a
verdict
extent
without
on
its
face
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
on
its
face
entered.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible),
did
you
say
that
your
--
is
there
objection
to
it
in
congress
or
just
admission
of
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
ask
you
this?
would
you
see
any
difference
in
the
posture
of
the
basic
claims
of
this
appellant?
and
that
of
a
taxpayer
who
refuse
to
pay
any
taxes
so
long
as
the
--
some
of
the
taxes
were
being
used
to
maintain
a
war
that
he
objected
to
on
the
same
grounds?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
excuse?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
exclusionary
language
in
the
statute
that
you
referred
to
in
the
bond
case,
i
think
that
followed
the
amended
language.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
shall
not
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
welsh
case,
excuse
me.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
solicitor.
mr.
flym.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
raise
your
voice
a
little
bit
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
that
motion
had
been
made
one
of
the
rules
after
the
entry
of
the
judgments.
in
other
words,
it's
about
enough
to
allow
a
motion
an
arrest
of
the
execution
of
the
judgment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
between
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
do
not
accept
his
extension
and
application
of
the
--
of
your
position
to,
for
example,
the
social
security
payments
or
unemployment
compensation
or
taxes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
this
is
just
limited
to
the
war
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
how
do
we
know
that
he
is
going
to
be
compelled
to
kill?
that's
an
issue
that
didn't
get
discussed
very
much
but
he
might
wind
up
working
in
the
embassy
in
paris.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
he
does
not
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
not
kill
anybody?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
wait
a
minute
let
me
see.
you
haven't
been
concerned
as
i
understood
you
the
thrust
of
your
case
with
his
being
deprived
of
his
liberty
but
being
made
to
fight
a
war.
now,
assume
he
was
sent
to
paris
to
work
in
the
embassy,
do
you
have
a
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
a
complaint?
do
you
have
a
compliant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
that
get
into
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
claim
religious
exemption
here?
are
you
now
arguing
for
religious
exemption?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
postpone
till
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
flym,
you
may
pick
up
where
you
left
off.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
as
they
understood
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
a
particular
focus
to
put
that
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
counsel,
this
familiar
history
is
very
interesting
but
let's
bring
it
down
to
the
particular
case,
and
if
i
may
put
to
you
again
the
question
i
suggested
yesterday,
would
his
rights
of
conscience
be
violated
if
in
fact
he
were
taken
in
and
assigned
as
a
security
guard
at
the
american
embassy
in
paris
for
the
entire
tour
of
his
duty?
would
his
rights
of
conscience
be
invaded?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
his
objection
was
to
the
particular
war
being
conducted
in
vietnam?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
all
military
service
or
just
the
war
in
vietnam,
i
wanted
it
that
clear?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
have
difficulty
reconciling
the
points
as
you
state
them
now
and
his
own
declaration
which
if
i
understood
this
record
were
all
aimed
at
military
activity
in
vietnam.
did
i
misread
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
i'm
making
a
distinction
between
what
he
said
and
what
you
were
saying,
and
i
here
at
least
see
a
difference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
say
we
must
read
the
article
1
as
meaning
that
the
congress
has
the
power
to
raise
and
support
armies
in
time
of
war
but
it's
limited
to
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
time
of
national
emergency.
who's
going
to
define
the
national
emergency?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
congress?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
if
the
individual
person
being
inducted
did
not
agree
that
it
was
a
national
emergency?
could
be
escape
service
on
the
grounds
of
conscience?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
congress
enacted
a
resolution
declaring
the
situation
in
vietnam,
a
national
emergency,
would
you
-–
would
you
then
dismiss
your
appeal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
did
not
say
a
declaration
of
war.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
i
remind
you,
mr.
flym,
you
are
now
using
your
rebuttal
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
excuse
me,
as
i've
forgotten
on
our
start-–
you
started
to
do
-–
you
were
on
yesterday,
yes,
yes,
excuse
me.
already
have.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
flym.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor,
go
back
to
that
statute
for
a
moment.
as
you
read
it,
as
you
see
it,
the
direct
appeal
to
this
court
did
not
foreclose
the
application
of
the
transfer
statute
and
therefore,
the
direct
appeal
is
i
take
it
simply
to
provide
expedition
in
a
proper
case
where
important
interests
were
involved.
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
to
–-
i
am
speaking
-–
addressing
myself
just
to
the
reasons,
the
congressional
reasons
that
you
see
for
the
direct
appeal
was
because
i
am
would
be
–-
it
might
well
be
of
the
essence
in
those
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
might
not
always
involve
a
great
issue
of
time
necessarily,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
without
regard
to
the
time
factors
involved?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
would
be
carving
out,
mr.
solicitor
general.
you
would
not
be,
but
the
consequence
of
your
position
would
be
that
there
would
be
carved
out
a
final
decision
of
a
district
judge
holding
an
act
of
congress
unconstitutional
which
is
un-reviewable
by
anyone?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose,
mr.
solicitor
general
however
if
this
court
and
some
other
case,
unrelated
case
or
some
other
case
should
express
its
views,
and
if
those
views
were
inconsistent
with
the
views
reached
by
judge
wyzanski
in
this
case,
there
would
be
nothing
to
prevent
the
government
from
going
to
the
district
court
and
asking
-–
making
a
motion
for
the
modification
for
the
arrest
of
judgment,
would
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
solicitor
general
for
your
submission.

you,
mr.

well
counsel,
this
familiar

is
very
interesting
but
let's
bring
it
down
to
the
particular
case,
and
if
i
may
put
to

again
the
question
i
suggested
yesterday,
would
his

be
violated
if
in

taken

did
i
misread
the

so
i'm
making
a
distinction
between
what
he
said
and
what
you
were
saying,
and
i
here
at

see
a

do
you

we

well,
what
if
the
individual
person
being
inducted
did
not
agree
that
it
was
a
national
emergency?
could
be
escape
service
on
the
grounds
of

chief

e.

if
congress
enacted
a
resolution
declaring
the
situation
in
vietnam,
a
national
emergency,
would
you

would
you
then
dismiss

e.

i
did
not
say
a
declaration
of

chief

e.

may
i
remind
you,
mr.
flym,
you
are
now
using

excuse

as

on

you

thank

mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor,
go
back
to
that
statute
for
a
moment.
as
you
read
it,
as
you
see
it,
the
direct
appeal
to
this
court
did
not
foreclose
the
application
of
the
transfer
statute
and
therefore,
the
direct
appeal
is
i
take
it
simply
to
provide
expedition
in
a
proper
case
where
important
interests
were
involved.
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
to
–-
i
am
speaking
-–
addressing
myself
just
to
the
reasons,
the
congressional
reasons
that
you
see
for
the
direct
appeal
was
because
i
am
would
be
–-
it
might
well
be
of
the
essence
in
those
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
might
not
always
involve
a
great
issue
of
time
necessarily,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
without
regard
to
the
time
factors
involved?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
would
be
carving
out,
mr.
solicitor
general.
you
would
not
be,
but
the
consequence
of
your
position
would
be
that
there
would
be
carved
out
a
final
decision
of
a
district
judge
holding
an
act
of
congress
unconstitutional
which
is
un-reviewable
by
anyone?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose,
mr.
solicitor
general
however
if
this
court
and
some
other
case,
unrelated
case
or
some
other
case
should
express
its
views,
and
if
those
views
were
inconsistent
with
the
views
reached
by
judge
wyzanski
in
this
case,
there
would
be
nothing
to
prevent
the
government
from
going
to
the
district
court
and
asking
-–
making
a
motion
for
the
modification
for
the
arrest
of
judgment,
would
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
solicitor
general
for
your
submission.
thank
you,
mr.
flym.
the
case
is
submitted.
