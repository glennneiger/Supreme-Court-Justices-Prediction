what
page
is
it
on
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
only
reference
you
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
to
this?
i
don't
see
anything
in
here
that
necessarily
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
they
thought
a
man
could
get
out
of
going
to
the
army
constitutionally
because
of
his
religious
belief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
it's
your
idea
that
anything
–-
anytime
a
man
believes
its
wrong
to
go
to
war,
it
couldn't
be
conscripted
that
was
almost
necessary
to
do
away
with
conscription,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
were
allowed
to
distinguish
between
the
two,
wouldn't
it,
when
you
begin
to
probe
the
line?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
do
not
have
a
right
to
conscript
in
time
of
peace?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
argument
you're
making?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
your
central
argument
against
the
standing
army
on
the
constitutional
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know,
but
again
the
conscripting?

a

army?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
are
challenging
as
i
understand
is
in
the
court's
hand,
you
first
told
me
that
there
could
be
a
conscript
and
i
may
--
could
be
used
into
time
of
peace
was
rather
than
war?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
national
emergency?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
who
would
decide
it
finally?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who

justice
hugo

this
court?
justice
hugo
l.

well,
might
that
have
been
the
reason
they
put
in
to
the
constitution
or
congress
to
raise
armies?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
favor
to
a
militia?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall
it
or
my
memory
maybe
entirely
wrong.
those
who
insisted
on
having
nothing
but
a
militia,
state
militia,
were
defeated
in
the
constitutional
convention
and
it
was
provided
that
the
congress
agrees
on?
