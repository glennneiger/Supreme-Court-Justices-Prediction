you're

well,
--
justice
byron

i'm
not

justice
byron
r.
white
--
that's
accurately
what
you're
doing?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you,
mr.
solicitor
general,
suppose
a
trial
judge
makes
some
findings
of
fact
as
a
basis
for
his
arrest
or
his
order
arresting
judgment,
facts
which
were
stipulated
to
or
anything
else.
and
suppose
that
the
–-
these
weren't
evident
on
the
face
of
the
indictment
and
so
on
and
that
this
couldn't
properly
be
called
an
arrest
of
judgment,
what
happens
then
in
terms
of
appeal?
i
suppose
it
wouldn't
and
i
assume
it
isn't
the
plea
in
bar
or
it
isn't
–-
justice
byron
r.
white
it
certainly
wouldn't
be
just
a
motion
–-
just
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment
since
he's
made
factual
findings.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
position
is
that
he
has
been
placed
in
jeopardy
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
wouldn't
think
an
appeal
would
lie
into
that
sense?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
that
-–
does
the
same
sort
of
fact
finding
vitiate
an
appeal
under
that
provision
like
it
does
in
the
arrest
of
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
it
–-
but
if
we
disagreed
with
the
government
here
and
said
that
there
were
fact
finding
and
there
was
a
species
of
fact
finding
here
in
this
case
which
removed
it
from
the
arrest
of
judgment
category,
then
there
just
wouldn't
be
an
appeal
anywhere?
