the
statute
says,
from
a
decision,
does
it?
justice
thurgood

but
general,
how
do
we
--
aren't
we
further
confused
by
the
fact
that
it
was
a
motion
towards
the
indictment
at
the
beginning
of
it,
which
he
denied?
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
quash
the
indictment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
dismissing
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
denied.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
one
of
them
was
that
and
yet,
after
the
trial
then
he
dismisses
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
you
dispute
them
he's
going
to
lose
this
case?
you
need
to
agree
to
him
in
order
to
give
him
the
right
to
arrest
of
the
judgment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
solicitor,
supposed
that
not
this
case
but
there
is
an
establish
religion
that
we
will
both
agree
is
offensive
and
they
say
the
war
in
vietnam
is
bad
for
some
reason
and
were
against
it.
we
urge
all
participants
not
to
participate
that
would
be
sufficient,
would
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
case
there.
i'm
only
trying
to
take
here
the
statute
report.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want

justice
thurgood
marshall
where's
that
leave
your
client?
justice
thurgood

uh-huh.
justice
thurgood
marshall
arrested.
that's
all
the

said.
that's
all
the
opinion
said.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
he
stand.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he's
still
there
but
is
arrested.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
just
wondering,
how
would
you
report
that
if
somebody
says
if
you
have
been
convicted
how
you
would
report
that,
while
arrested?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
you're
so
busy
giving
this
court
jurisdiction
but
i'm
just
wondering
what
you
are
doing
with
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
flym,
can
you
help
me
with
my
problem
of
getting
conscience
and
legality
together?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
use
of
equip–-
put
in
the
same
bowl
the
fact
that
i
disagree
with
the
legality
of
an
act
of
congress
with
my
conscience
–-
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
because
i
disagree,
my
conscience
tells
me
i
can
abide
by
that
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
so
--
i
have
a
great
problem
with
conscience
and
politics.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
have
already
agreed
that
that
argument
can
be
made
by
anybody
of
the
insisting?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
to
insist?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
agree.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
a
difficult
problem
that
tells
me
how
being
on
duty
in
the
embassy
in
paris
is
aide
in
the
vietnam
war,
i
have
great
difficulty
with
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
course
that
he
doesn't
want
to
serve
at
any
place
in
the
military?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
couldn't
–-
do
you
say
that
the
congress
does
not
have
the
right
to
say
that
this
man
shall
be
put
in
the
army
and
assigned
to
his
hometown?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
he
objects
military
service?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
understand
how
the
point
got
involved
in
this
case.
it's
elicit
there
and
everybody
i
thought
understood
that
this
was
a
case
of
selective
choosing
of
not
fighting
in
the
vietnam
war?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
your
grievance,
did
you
allege
the
violation
of
the
bill
of
rights?
sure
you
did,
didn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wasn't
the
basis
of
your
complaint
that
to
adopt
this
man
would
violate
his
rights
protected
by
the
bill
of
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
now
you're
abandoning
the
bill
of
rights?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
was
president
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
madison?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
man
whom
you
quoted
a
while
ago?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
england
have
a
standing
army
at
