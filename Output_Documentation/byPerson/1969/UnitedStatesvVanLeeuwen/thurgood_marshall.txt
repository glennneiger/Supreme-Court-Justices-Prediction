justice
thurgood
marshall
what
time?
how
many
hours?
five
hours?
justice
thurgood
marshall
two
hours?
justice
thurgood
marshall
one
hour
and
five
minutes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
find
nothing
wrong
as
of
that
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
took
a
little
time
to
type
an
affidavit
up,
didn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
does
take
time
to
type
an
affidavit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
to
recheck,
it's
–-
so
how
many
hours
would
you
think
would
be
maximum
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
hours
is
that,
five
hours?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you're
complaining
about
approximately
24
hours?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
did
that
injure
your
–-
justice
thurgood
marshall
other
than
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
did
it
affect
his
constitutional
rights?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
suppose
at
the
end
of
the
29
hours,
they
decided
not
to
do
anything
and
had
shifted.
would
your
man
have
been
injured?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
wouldn't
be
injured
at
all,
would
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
what
are
you
complaining
about,
the
seizure
or
the
stop?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
are
you
complaining
about,
the
seizure
and
the
opening
of
it,
or
the
timing
of
the
29
hours?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
record,
wouldn't
you
agree
that
at
times,
even
registered
mail
is
lost?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
say
that.
i
said
if
they
had
shifted
and
relied
on
catching
at
the
other
end,
they
might
not
have
been
able
to
catch
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
there
is
no
magistrate
that's
available
for
29
hours?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
you
could
have
come
to
this
court,
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
assuming
you
give
us
the
jurisdiction.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
get
–-
i
had
great
problems
with
the
number
of
hours
as
being
your
only
complaint.
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
you
say
that
they
could've
gotten
a
warrant
in
two
or
three
hours?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
then,
what
is
your
complaint?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
all
–-
it's
the
point
of
26
hours?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
didn't
affect
the
property.
the
gold
is
still
the
same
thing.
nothing
happened
to
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
nothing
happened
to
the
place
where
was
the
gold
because
it
was
sent
back,
wasn't
delivered?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i'm
saying
that
–-
what
damage
was
done
to
him
or
his
property?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
fourth
amendment
require
that
to
be
obtained
in
less
than
29
hours?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
now,
i
could
see
between
that
case
and
this
case
if
the
heroine
was
in
package
at
the
post
office?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
that
you
can't
open
a
package
of
heroine
until
you
get
a
search
warrant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
what
-–
that's
this
case.
they
did
get
a
search
warrant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
i
have
the
right
of
action
every
time
my
mail
is
held
up
for
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
hope
it's
the
damages,
too.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
says
that's
not
true.
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
mr.
davis,
i
think
that
as
possibility
of
a
decision
being
written
against
you
and
not
reach
any
of
those
things
you

now
talking
about.
justice
thurgood

justice
thurgood

you
find

justice
thurgood

marshall
it

take
time
to

justice
thurgood

and
to

it's

so
how
many

how
many
hours
is
that,
