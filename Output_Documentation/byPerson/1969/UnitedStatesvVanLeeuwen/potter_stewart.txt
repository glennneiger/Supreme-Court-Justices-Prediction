isn't
it
illegal
to
possess
gold
coins,
quite
a

justice

stewart
i
thought
there
was
a
time,
almost
a
generation
ago
when
everybody
was
required
to
turn
in
all
these
gold?
justice
potter
stewart
and
thereafter,
it
was
illegal
to
possess
them?
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
very
--
very
happy
to
hear
that
because
i
was
disturbed
the
other
day
when
i
found
a
$5.00
gold
piece
in
my
safe
deposit
box.
[laughter]
it
was
given
to
me
when
i
was
ten

old.

the

the

had
been
seized
under
that

on

justice

well
then,
i
particularly
have
this

it

that
there
was
