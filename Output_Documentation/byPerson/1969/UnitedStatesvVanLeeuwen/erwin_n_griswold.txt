mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
case
here
on
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
involves
an
interesting
and
novel
question
under
the
fourth
amendment
with
respect
to
search
and
seizure.
the
facts,
the
underlying
facts
in
this
case
occurred
on
march
28
and
29,
1968.
on
that
day,
not
quite
two
years
ago,
at
1:30
pm
at
the
united
states
post
office
at
mt.
vernon
in
the
state
of
washington,
the
respondent
appeared,
deposited
for
mailing
two
heavy
packages,
12
pounds
each.
it
is
relevant
that
the
post
office
at
mt.
vernon,
washington
is
in
the
western
part
of
the
state
of
washington
and
about
60
miles
south
of
the
canadian
border.
one
of
these
packages
was
addressed
to
a
post
office
box
in
van
nuys,
california
and
the
other
two
to
a
post
office
box
in
nashville,
tennessee.
both
bore
a
return
address
in
a
neighboring
town
adjacent
to
mt.
vernon.
postage
was
paid
at
the
airmail
rate.
the
packages
were
registered
and
insured,
each
one
for
$10,000.00,
a
total
of
$20,000.00
for
the
two,
and
in
response
to
a
request
from
the
post
office
clerk,
it
was
declared
that
they
contained
coins
or
a
coin
collection.
the
post
office
clerk
was
suspicious
and
he
immediately
advised
an
officer
of
the
mt.
vernon
police
who
happened
to
be
in
the
lobby
of
his
suspicions,
and
captain
belgard
of
the
police
observed
the
car
departing
and
noticed
that
it
had
british
columbia
license
plates.
the
package
was
then
examined
and
the
police
captain
and
the
post
office
clerk
were
both
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
address
given
on
the
package
was
of
a
nearby
--
a
junior
college
of
quarters
which
had
been
unoccupied
for
several
weeks.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
return
address,
the
return
address.
captain
belgard
then
perhaps
somewhat
surprisingly
telephoned
the
canadian
royal
mounted
police
and
not
the
u.s.
customs
or
the
fbi,
but
he
telephoned
the
canadian
police
in
vancouver
and
it
was
the
canadian
police
who
put
in
a
call
to
mr.
o’hearn,
the
customs
officer-in-charge
at
seattle,
washington,
and
the
details
so
far
as
they
were
known
were
thus
transmitted
to
mr.
o’hearn
in
seattle.
by
this
time,
it
was
about
3
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
and
mr.
o'hearn
then
put
in
a
telephone
call
to
the
customs
office
in
van
nuys
in
california,
and
he
was
advised
that
the
addressee
of
the
package
being
sent
there
was
under
investigation
for
dealing
in
illegal
coins.
by
the
time
he
had
completed
that
call,
it
was
beyond
the
closing
time
in
nashville,
which
i
believe
is
three
hours
in
advance
of
seattle;
it
may
be
two,
and
mr.
o'hearn
then
delayed
until
the
following
morning
in
calling
to
nashville,
the
morning
of
the
29.
he
got
similar
information
from
the
customs
officer
in
nashville.
i
believe
he
had
to
do
that
through
mobile
as
a
matter
of
fact
since
the
headquarters
was
in
mobile.
mr.
o'hearn
then
prepared
the
affidavit
for
a
search
warrant,
which
appears
on
page
5
of
this
record
and
of
course,
the
preparation
of
that
took
time
both
for
composition
and
for
typing.
it
was
then
presented
to
the
united
states
commissioner
in
seattle,
and
that
of
course
took
time
to
find
the
commissioner
free
from
other
responsibilities
and
to
give
him
time
for
consideration.
at
4
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day,
march
29,
the
commissioner
issued
a
search
warrant
in
seattle.
now,
seattle
is
some
60
miles
south
of
mt.
vernon
and
mr.
o'hearn
took
the
search
warrant
to
mt.
vernon
and
there
served
it
at
6:30
pm
on
march
29,
which
is
about
29
hours
after
the
events
first
began
when
the
package
was
deposited
in
the
post
office
in
mt.
vernon.
and
the
problem
arises
because
the
package
was
held
in
mt.
vernon
and
was
not
forwarded
at
once
through
the
usual
united
states
post
office
channels.
when
the
warrant
was
served,
the
packages
were
found
to
contain
several
hundred
gold
coins.
the
packages
were
resealed,
sent
on
to
the
addressees,
they
were
refused
by
the
addressees
and
were
returned
to
the
post
office
in
mt.
vernon.
now,
other
evidence
at
the
trial
showed
that
the
respondent
had
in
fact
imported
these
coins.
there
was
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
of
the
gold
coins,
which
was
denied
by
the
district
court.
the
respondent
was
convicted
of
a
violation
of
the
customs
laws
in
having
imported
the
coins
without
a
proper
declaration,
and
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
that
court
held
that
the
evidence
should
have
been
suppressed
on
the
ground
that
the
delay
in
holding
the
coins
in
mt.
vernon
for
29
hours
was
unreasonable
and
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
that
is
the
sole
issue
which
is
now
before
the
court
on
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari.
before
going
further,
let
me
simply
recall
the
simple
words
of
the
fourth
amendment,
“the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
persons,
houses,
papers,
and
effects
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
shall
not
be
violated
and
no
warrant
shall
issue,
but
upon
probable
cause
supported
by
oath
or
affirmation
and
particularly
describing
the
place
to
be
searched
and
the
persons
or
things
to
be
seized.
and
here
of
course,
a
warrant
was
issued,
on
probable
cause
supported
by
oath
or
affirmation,
and
particularly
describing
the
place
to
be
searched
and
the
persons
or
things
to
be
seized.
this
is
not
a
case
of
search
without
a
warrant.
here,
there
was
a
search
with
a
warrant.
the
problem
arises
because
the
police
officers
were
careful.
they
took
the
time
to
be
sure
that
they
had
the
proper
facts
and
because
the
post
office
employee
cooperated
in
that
process
by
holding
the
package
at
mt.
vernon,
washington.
now,
it
could
of
course
be
said
that
once
the
package
was
in
the
custody
of
the
post
office,
it
should
have
been
sent
on
and
somehow
or
other,
the
officers
could
have
followed
it
and
kept
track
of
it
and
before
it
was
actually
delivered
at
their
respective
destinations,
these
various
inquiries
could
have
been
made.
the
logistic
and
manpower
problems
involved
and
that
the
number
of
people
required
in
at
least
three
or
four
different
locations
as
such
as
it
seems
to
me
to
make
that
approach
not
a
reasonable
requirement
under
all
circumstances.
now,
there
is
an
aspect
of
this
case
which
seems
to
me
to
be
of
very
considerable
importance.
last
june,
this
court
decided
the
shamel
case,
and
curiously
enough
also
involving
coins.
i
don't
know
whether
coins
have
become
a
special
target
in
this
area
and
in
the
shamel
case,
some
of
the
prior
decisions
of
the
court
with
respect
to
the
extent
to
which
a
search
without
a
warrant
may
be
made
incident
to
an
arrest
were
sharply
cut
down.
and
there
is
a
consequence
of
the
shamel
case,
which
i
assume
is
going
to
have
to
be
presented
in
later
cases.
that
is
the
extent
to
which
granting
that
the
police
cannot
conduct
an
extensive
search
and
seizure
in
the
premises
incident
to
an
arrest,
to
what
extent
can
the
police
officers
impose
a
stillstand
on
the
situation?
lock
the
door,
keep
people
from
entering
and
leaving,
prevent
people
inside
the
premises
from
destroying
evidences
while
they
go
through
the
necessary
process
obviously
requiring
under
current
conditions
of
several
hours
of
preparing
a
warrant
--
an
affidavit
for
a
search
warrant
under
--
in
many
cases,
this
will
require
not
merely
the
police
officer
but
participation
by
a
lawyer
and
assistant
united
states
attorney
or
appropriate
state
officer,
typing,
finding
a
magistrate,
submitting
it
to
him,
and
giving
him
an
opportunity
to
consider
it,
and
then
upon
it's
issuance,
the
opportunity
to
serve.
and
unless
there
is
some
opportunity
to
impose
a
stillstand,
not
to
seize
but
simply
to
hold
things
in
the
status
--
status
quo,
the
evidence
in
many
of
these
cases
will
be
destroyed
and
the
opportunity
to
make
an
effective
search
will
evaporate.
now,
that
is
not
this
case.
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest.
this
is
a
situation,
however,
where
post
office
employees
in
association
with
other
governmental
officers,
did
preserve
the
situation
in
status
quo
by
not
sending
on
the
package
in
the
normal
processes
of
the
u.s.
mails.
i
would
point
out
too
in
the
consideration
of
this
matter
as
bearing
on
the
reasonableness
of
their
action
that
there
is
no
communication
involved
here.
there
is
no
letter.
there
is
no
transmission
of
intelligence.
this
was
simply
goods,
simply
gold
coins.
the
delay
of
29
hours
in
the
delivery
of
a
package
is
not
unprecedented
and
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
it
was
a
matter
of
any
seriousness
to
anyone
involved.
now,
it's
curious,
though
i
suppose
explainable
because
of
the
development
of
--
the
recent
development
of
cases
like
shamel,
but
it's
curious
that
it's
almost
impossible
to
find
any
indication
in
the
decisions
in
this
court
or
elsewhere
of
the
extent
to
which
the
police
may
take
steps
to
preserve
the
status
quo
while
warrants
are
being
obtained.
back,
a
generation
ago
in
taylor
against
the
united
states,
this
court
pointed
out
that
“a
short
period
of
watching
during
the
time
required
to
secure
a
search
warrant
could
have
prevented
the
possibility
of
any
change
in
the
premises
from
which
government
agents
had
smelled
the
order
of
whiskey.
”
and
in
the
trupiano
case
in
334
u.s.,
the
court
striking
down
a
search
without
a
warrant
noted
that
a
warrant
could
have
been
obtained
without
any
risk
of
removal
since
one
of
the
agents,
and
i
quote,
“was
on
hand
at
all
times
to
report
and
guard
against
such
a
move.
”
now,
there
were
no
issue
in
those
cases
as
to
the
validity
of
a
restraint
which
might
have
been
imposed
while
a
warrant
was
being
obtained,
but
the
court
in
those
cases
seemed
to
feel
that
such
a
restraint
would
have
been
not
only
natural
and
understandable,
but
justifiable.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
mentioned
that
in
stating
the
facts,
but
the
problems
of
tracing
and
keeping
track
of,
and
a
number
of
people
involved
and
frankly,
i
don't
know
whether
a
warrant
issued
by
united
states
commissioner
in
seattle
is
valid
in
van
nuys,
california
or
in
nashville,
tennessee,
whether
it
might
not
have
had
to
be
presented
to
a
commissioner
in
those
places.
one
of
the
charges
against
this
warrant
now
pressed,
i
believe
is
that
it
was
based
on
hearsay
and
on
facts
not
within
the
knowledge
of
the
affiant.
it
would
of
course
be
of
far
more
extreme
as
you
got
two
officers
in
california
and
in
nashville,
tennessee.
it
would
have
involved
a
great
many
--
more
people,
and
our
position
is
that
the
limited
delay
in
this
case,
not
six
months,
not
a
week,
29
hours,
or
not
much
more
than
overnight
was
not
unreasonable
under
the
circumstances,
particularly
when
it
was
the
consequence
of
the
fact
that
the
officers
were
trying
to
do
their
duty
carefully
and
thoughtfully,
were
seeking
to
obtain
a
search
warrant,
were
trying
to
discover
the
facts
so
that
if
there
was
no
basis
for
a
warrant,
that
would
not
be
obtained.
and
our
view
is
that
to
impose
a
requirement
that
you
must
send
the
things
on
and
then
try
to
catch
them
before
they're
delivered
would
be
too
technical,
required
too
much
expenditure
of
manpower,
too
much
risk
of
loss.
when
the
suspected
material
is
in
the
custody
of
the
united
states
and
rightly
so,
this
reasonable
--
this
period
seems
to
us
to
have
been
a
reasonable
one.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
mr.
justice,
i
thought
about
that
argument
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
say
that
gold
coins
as
such
are
contraband.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
suppose
any
united
states
citizen
who
has
a
collection
of
gold
coins,
can
legally
transmit
them
by
mail
to
somebody
else,
to
a
dealer
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
here,
we
have
only
the
suspicion
that
these
have
come
across
from
canada.
we
have
grounds
for
believing
that
they
have
come
across
from
canada
but
they
were
in
fact
deposited
in
a
united
states
post
office
60
miles
within
the
united
states.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
they
would
be
forfeited
under
the
customs
law,
mr.
justice,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
i
understand
that
there
are
exceptions
to
the
gold
statutes
and
regulations
under
which
coins
bona
fide
held
for
collecting
purposes
are
perfectly
legal.
indeed,
i
see
them
advertised
in
the
papers
and
i
think
that
for
$95.00,
you
can
now
buy
a
$20.00
gold
piece
which
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
there
was
an
exception
of
bona
fide
collectors'
items,
whether
that
was
due
to
the
fact
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that
raises
all
kinds
of
questions
about
self
incrimination
that
i
-–
that
i
don't
think
we
need
to
go
into
here.
in
some
ways,
the
case
which
seems
to
me
to
be
the
closest
is
the
terry
case,
it's
terry
against
ohio
decided
two
years
ago.
i
think
i
would
like,
before
referring
to
terry
case
however,
to
make
reference
to
mr.
justice
white's
dissenting
opinion
in
the
shamel
case
because
he
did,
there
deal
more
extensively
than
i've
been
able
to
find
any
place
else
with
what
i
regard
as
the
underlying
problem
here.
now,
it
is
true
that
he
was
using
it
as
an
argument
that
the
search
without
a
warrant
should
be
valid
and
he
was
in
the
minority
on
that,
and
we
are
not
contending
here
that
a
search
without
a
warrant
is
valid.
but
on
page
774
of
justice
white's
dissent,
he
said,
“when
there
must
almost
always
be
a
strong
possibility
that
confederates
of
the
arrested
man
will
in
the
meanwhile
remove
the
items
for
which
the
police
have
probable
cause
to
search.
and
on
page
775,
he
says,
“moreover,
had
the
police
simply
arrested
the
petitioner,
taken
him
off
to
the
station
house
and
later
returned
with
a
warrant,
it
seems
very
likely
that
the
petitioner's
wife,
who
in
view
of
petitioner's
generally
garrulous
nature
must
have
known
of
the
robbery,
would
have
removed
the
coins.
now,
our
position
is
that,
our
contention,
our
suggestion
is
that
that
argument
not
having
prevailed,
there
nevertheless
remains
open
this
question
which
i
call
of
the
opportunity
to
impose
the
stillstand.
now,
just
how
that
can
be
done,
what
manpower's
involved,
what
force
can
properly
be
used
remains
to
be
seen?
but
we
contend
here
that
in
a
different
situation
where
the
goods
are
already
in
the
custody
of
the
united
states,
having
been
confined
to
the
--
confided
to
the
united
states
mail
that
it
is
appropriate
for
the
officers
of
the
government
to
preserve
the
status
quo
while
the
warrant
is
being
carefully
and
thoughtfully
obtained.
now,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
terry
case
itself
because
that
is
a
case
which
goes
into
these
questions
of
unreasonable
search
and
seizure,
the
meaning
of
unreasonable
where
you
do
not
have
an
arrest
or
a
seizure
involved.
in
the
terry
case,
you
remember
the
problem
was
of
the
power
of
the
police
to
take
action
short
of
an
arrest
by
way
of
what
is
popularly
known
as
stop
and
frisk,
by
way
of
patting
a
man's
clothes
to
see
whether
he
was
armed
and
on
finding
a
hard
object,
reaching
in
and
removing
it.
and
in
that
opinion,
chief
justice
warren
discussed
at
some
length
the
difference
between
the
cause
required
to
obtain
a
search
warrant,
which
would
be
probable
cause
to
--
or
an
arrest
warrant,
it
would
be
in
that
case
-–
a
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
crime
had
been
committed
and
the
cause
which
was
required
for
a
police
officer
to
take
this
interlocutory
step.
and
it
really
comes
down
to
this,
whether
there
was
probable
cause
for
suspicion
with
respect
to
the
commission
of
a
crime
and
the
safety
of
the
police
officer.
i
won't
take
the
time
to
quote
from
that
opinion,
particularly
on
pages
21
to
24.
only
by
way
of
analogy,
but
by
considerable
analogy,
there
is
discussion
of
this
shorter
step
of
this
step
short
of
an
arrest
or
of
a
procedure
and
we
feel
that
there
is
a
substantial
support
in
the
terry
case
for
the
proposition
that
the
step
taken
here,
and
the
only
step
against
which
complaint
is
made
is
the
holding
of
the
package
for
29
hours
and
it
would've
had
to
be
held
for
a
substantial
portion
of
that
at
the
very
best,
but
that
was
not
unreasonable.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
there's
no
question
of
safety
here,
but
it
is
suggested
that
the
only
duty
of
a
post
office
clerk
is
to
send
the
package
on
forth
with
and
i
suggested
if
on
the
exam
--
on
handling
the
package
in
the
process
of
putting
it
into
the
mail
bag
and
he
hears
it
ticking
that
he
may
find
it
quite
reasonably
that
he
has
some
duty
other
than
to
send
it
on
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
perhaps
not.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
terry
is
a
precise
analogy.
i
am
suggesting
that
it
is
an
application
of
–-
or
a
determination
of
what
is
reasonable
conduct
under
the
circumstances,
and
our
suggestion
is
that
in
this
case,
not
involving
a
communication,
nothing
about
the
first
amendment,
simply
goods
in
transit
but
to
delay
them
for
a
day
in
the
process
of
being
careful
in
seeking
a
search
warrant
and
then
seeking
a
search
warrant
through
the
judgment
of
an
independent
magistrate
is
not
such
unreasonable
conduct
as
to
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
suppose
it
is
with
the
stop
and
the
search,
although
the
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
of
course,
the
stop
is
only
for
seconds.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
long
enough
to
ask
him
with
questions
and
we
have
a
somewhat
longer
time
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
just
two
points
that
i
would
like
to
make.
mr.
davis
has
referred
to
statutes
which
required
the
mail,
as
he
has
said
to
be
forwarded
promptly.
actually,
the
statute
is
printed
at
the
bottom
of
page
2
of
the
appendix
to
his
brief,
section
710
of
title
39
of
the
united
states
code
and
it
reads,
“letters
brought
for
mailing
to
a
post
office
and
so
forth
shall
be
sent
on.
this
of
course
was
not
a
letter.
i
don't
regard
this
as
of
any
great
importance,
but
i
do
not
think
there
was
any
violation
of
that
statute
in
this
case.
and
the
other
point
i
would
make
is
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
sorry,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
this
is
an
internal
housekeeping
part
of
the
post
office
statute,
a
direction
to
postal
employees.
there
are
other
statutory
provisions
which
make
it
a
crime
with
penalties
attached
to
interfere
with
the
mails,
but
i
understand
them
to
be
directed
to
outsiders,
to
persons
who
obstruct
the
mails
in
one
way
or
another
and
not
to
postal
employees.
now,
the
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
simply
this.
it
would
seem
that
mr.
davis'
real
complaint
is
that
the
warrant
was
not
obtained
on
march
28,
rather
on
march
29.
i
think
it
could
be
that
warrant
could
have
been
obtained
on
march
28
and
that
i
don't
think
i
would
have
too
much
difficulty
in
seeking
to
defend
it
here,
if
it
had
been.
i
would
point
out
that
the
information
then
available
related
to
only
one
of
the
packages,
which
might
have
been
enough
to
establish
a
crime,
but
not
enough
to
seize
the
other
package.
what
i
would
hope
would
be
that
the
court
would
leave
a
little
leeway
here,
not
to
setup
a
rule
which
would
mean
that
the
instant
you
really
now
have
enough,
you
must
then
and
there
go
in
and
get
it
because
the
lines
are
not
easy
to
draw
here.
they
are
hard
to
draw
long
after
the
event
and
the
calm
deliberation
of
this
court.
they
are
much
harder
to
draw
for
the
individual
officer
on
the
scene
who
has
to
decide
whether
“well,
if
i
go
in
now,
will
it
be
found
that
i
did
not
have
enough?
here,
the
officer
was
careful.
he
did
no
harm
in
the
process
of
being
careful.
it
seems
to
me
he
ought
to
be
commended
for
having
done
a
fine
work
and
that
the
delay
which
was
involved
was
reasonable
and
should
not
be
held
to
invalidate
the
seizure
in
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
case
here
on
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
involves
an
interesting
and
novel
question
under
the
fourth
amendment
with
respect
to
search
and
seizure.
the
facts,
the
underlying
facts
in
this
case
occurred
on
march
28
and
29,
1968.
on
that
day,
not
quite
two
years
ago,
at
1:30
pm
at
the
united
states
post
office
at
mt.
vernon
in
the
state
of
washington,
the
respondent
appeared,
deposited
for
mailing
two
heavy
packages,
12
pounds
each.
it
is
relevant
that
the
post
office
at
mt.
vernon,
washington
is
in
the
western
part
of
the
state
of
washington
and
about
60
miles
south
of
the
canadian
border.
one
of
these
packages
was
addressed
to
a
post
office
box
in
van
nuys,
california
and
the
other
two
to
a
post
office
box
in
nashville,
tennessee.
both
bore
a
return
address
in
a
neighboring
town
adjacent
to
mt.
vernon.
postage
was
paid
at
the
airmail
rate.
the
packages
were
registered
and
insured,
each
one
for
$10,000.00,
a
total
of
$20,000.00
for
the
two,
and
in
response
to
a
request
from
the
post
office
clerk,
it
was
declared
that
they
contained
coins
or
a
coin
collection.
the
post
office
clerk
was
suspicious
and
he
immediately
advised
an
officer
of
the
mt.
vernon
police
who
happened
to
be
in
the
lobby
of
his
suspicions,
and
captain
belgard
of
the
police
observed
the
car
departing
and
noticed
that
it
had
british
columbia
license
plates.
the
package
was
then
examined
and
the
police
captain
and
the
post
office
clerk
were
both
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
address
given
on
the
package
was
of
a
nearby
--
a
junior
college
of
quarters
which
had
been
unoccupied
for
several
weeks.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
return
address,
the
return
address.
captain
belgard
then
perhaps
somewhat
surprisingly
telephoned
the
canadian
royal
mounted
police
and
not
the
u.s.
customs
or
the
fbi,
but
he
telephoned
the
canadian
police
in
vancouver
and
it
was
the
canadian
police
who
put
in
a
call
to
mr.
o’hearn,
the
customs
officer-in-charge
at
seattle,
washington,
and
the
details
so
far
as
they
were
known
were
thus
transmitted
to
mr.
o’hearn
in
seattle.
by
this
time,
it
was
about
3
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
and
mr.
o'hearn
then
put
in
a
telephone
call
to
the
customs
office
in
van
nuys
in
california,
and
he
was
advised
that
the
addressee
of
the
package
being
sent
there
was
under
investigation
for
dealing
in
illegal
coins.
by
the
time
he
had
completed
that
call,
it
was
beyond
the
closing
time
in
nashville,
which
i
believe
is
three
hours
in
advance
of
seattle;
it
may
be
two,
and
mr.
o'hearn
then
delayed
until
the
following
morning
in
calling
to
nashville,
the
morning
of
the
29.
he
got
similar
information
from
the
customs
officer
in
nashville.
i
believe
he
had
to
do
that
through
mobile
as
a
matter
of
fact
since
the
headquarters
was
in
mobile.
mr.
o'hearn
then
prepared
the
affidavit
for
a
search
warrant,
which
appears
on
page
5
of
this
record
and
of
course,
the
preparation
of
that
took
time
both
for
composition
and
for
typing.
it
was
then
presented
to
the
united
states
commissioner
in
seattle,
and
that
of
course
took
time
to
find
the
commissioner
free
from
other
responsibilities
and
to
give
him
time
for
consideration.
at
4
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day,
march
29,
the
commissioner
issued
a
search
warrant
in
seattle.
now,
seattle
is
some
60
miles
south
of
mt.
vernon
and
mr.
o'hearn
took
the
search
warrant
to
mt.
vernon
and
there
served
it
at
6:30
pm
on
march
29,
which
is
about
29
hours
after
the
events
first
began
when
the
package
was
deposited
in
the
post
office
in
mt.
vernon.
and
the
problem
arises
because
the
package
was
held
in
mt.
vernon
and
was
not
forwarded
at
once
through
the
usual
united
states
post
office
channels.
when
the
warrant
was
served,
the
packages
were
found
to
contain
several
hundred
gold
coins.
the
packages
were
resealed,
sent
on
to
the
addressees,
they
were
refused
by
the
addressees
and
were
returned
to
the
post
office
in
mt.
vernon.
now,
other
evidence
at
the
trial
showed
that
the
respondent
had
in
fact
imported
these
coins.
there
was
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
of
the
gold
coins,
which
was
denied
by
the
district
court.
the
respondent
was
convicted
of
a
violation
of
the
customs
laws
in
having
imported
the
coins
without
a
proper
declaration,
and
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
that
court
held
that
the
evidence
should
have
been
suppressed
on
the
ground
that
the
delay
in
holding
the
coins
in
mt.
vernon
for
29
hours
was
unreasonable
and
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
that
is
the
sole
issue
which
is
now
before
the
court
on
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari.
before
going
further,
let
me
simply
recall
the
simple
words
of
the
fourth
amendment,
“the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
persons,
houses,
papers,
and
effects
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
shall
not
be
violated
and
no
warrant
shall
issue,
but
upon
probable
cause
supported
by
oath
or
affirmation
and
particularly
describing
the
place
to
be
searched
and
the
persons
or
things
to
be
seized.
and
here
of
course,
a
warrant
was
issued,
on
probable
cause
supported
by
oath
or
affirmation,
and
particularly
describing
the
place
to
be
searched
and
the
persons
or
things
to
be
seized.
this
is
not
a
case
of
search
without
a
warrant.
here,
there
was
a
search
with
a
warrant.
the
problem
arises
because
the
police
officers
were
careful.
they
took
the
time
to
be
sure
that
they
had
the
proper
facts
and
because
the
post
office
employee
cooperated
in
that
process
by
holding
the
package
at
mt.
vernon,
washington.
now,
it
could
of
course
be
said
that
once
the
package
was
in
the
custody
of
the
post
office,
it
should
have
been
sent
on
and
somehow
or
other,
the
officers
could
have
followed
it
and
kept
track
of
it
and
before
it
was
actually
delivered
at
their
respective
destinations,
these
various
inquiries
could
have
been
made.
the
logistic
and
manpower
problems
involved
and
that
the
number
of
people
required
in
at
least
three
or
four
different
locations
as
such
as
it
seems
to
me
to
make
that
approach
not
a
reasonable
requirement
under
all
circumstances.
now,
there
is
an
aspect
of
this
case
which
seems
to
me
to
be
of
very
considerable
importance.
last
june,
this
court
decided
the
shamel
case,
and
curiously
enough
also
involving
coins.
i
don't
know
whether
coins
have
become
a
special
target
in
this
area
and
in
the
shamel
case,
some
of
the
prior
decisions
of
the
court
with
respect
to
the
extent
to
which
a
search
without
a
warrant
may
be
made
incident
to
an
arrest
were
sharply
cut
down.
and
there
is
a
consequence
of
the
shamel
case,
which
i
assume
is
going
to
have
to
be
presented
in
later
cases.
that
is
the
extent
to
which
granting
that
the
police
cannot
conduct
an
extensive
search
and
seizure
in
the
premises
incident
to
an
arrest,
to
what
extent
can
the
police
officers
impose
a
stillstand
on
the
situation?
lock
the
door,
keep
people
from
entering
and
leaving,
prevent
people
inside
the
premises
from
destroying
evidences
while
they
go
through
the
necessary
process
obviously
requiring
under
current
conditions
of
several
hours
of
preparing
a
warrant
--
an
affidavit
for
a
search
warrant
under
--
in
many
cases,
this
will
require
not
merely
the
police
officer
but
participation
by
a
lawyer
and
assistant
united
states
attorney
or
appropriate
state
officer,
typing,
finding
a
magistrate,
submitting
it
to
him,
and
giving
him
an
opportunity
to
consider
it,
and
then
upon
it's
issuance,
the
opportunity
to
serve.
and
unless
there
is
some
opportunity
to
impose
a
stillstand,
not
to
seize
but
simply
to
hold
things
in
the
status
--
status
quo,
the
evidence
in
many
of
these
cases
will
be
destroyed
and
the
opportunity
to
make
an
effective
search
will
evaporate.
now,
that
is
not
this
case.
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest.
this
is
a
situation,
however,
where
post
office
employees
in
association
with
other
governmental
officers,
did
preserve
the
situation
in
status
quo
by
not
sending
on
the
package
in
the
normal
processes
of
the
u.s.
mails.
i
would
point
out
too
in
the
consideration
of
this
matter
as
bearing
on
the
reasonableness
of
their
action
that
there
is
no
communication
involved
here.
there
is
no
letter.
there
is
no
transmission
of
intelligence.
this
was
simply
goods,
simply
gold
coins.
the
delay
of
29
hours
in
the
delivery
of
a
package
is
not
unprecedented
and
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
it
was
a
matter
of
any
seriousness
to
anyone
involved.
now,
it's
curious,
though
i
suppose
explainable
because
of
the
development
of
--
the
recent
development
of
cases
like
shamel,
but
it's
curious
that
it's
almost
impossible
to
find
any
indication
in
the
decisions
in
this
court
or
elsewhere
of
the
extent
to
which
the
police
may
take
steps
to
preserve
the
status
quo
while
warrants
are
being
obtained.
back,
a
generation
ago
in
taylor
against
the
united
states,
this
court
pointed
out
that
“a
short
period
of
watching
during
the
time
required
to
secure
a
search
warrant
could
have
prevented
the
possibility
of
any
change
in
the
premises
from
which
government
agents
had
smelled
the
order
of
whiskey.
”
and
in
the
trupiano
case
in
334
u.s.,
the
court
striking
down
a
search
without
a
warrant
noted
that
a
warrant
could
have
been
obtained
without
any
risk
of
removal
since
one
of
the
agents,
and
i
quote,
“was
on
hand
at
all
times
to
report
and
guard
against
such
a
move.
”
now,
there
were
no
issue
in
those
cases
as
to
the
validity
of
a
restraint
which
might
have
been
imposed
while
a
warrant
was
being
obtained,
but
the
court
in
those
cases
seemed
to
feel
that
such
a
restraint
would
have
been
not
only
natural
and
understandable,
but
justifiable.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
mentioned
that
in
stating
the
facts,
but
the
problems
of
tracing
and
keeping
track
of,
and
a
number
of
people
involved
and
frankly,
i
don't
know
whether
a
warrant
issued
by
united
states
commissioner
in
seattle
is
valid
in
van
nuys,
california
or
in
nashville,
tennessee,
whether
it
might
not
have
had
to
be
presented
to
a
commissioner
in
those
places.
one
of
the
charges
against
this
warrant
now
pressed,
i
believe
is
that
it
was
based
on
hearsay
and
on
facts
not
within
the
knowledge
of
the
affiant.
it
would
of
course
be
of
far
more
extreme
as
you
got
two
officers
in
california
and
in
nashville,
tennessee.
it
would
have
involved
a
great
many
--
more
people,
and
our
position
is
that
the
limited
delay
in
this
case,
not
six
months,
not
a
week,
29
hours,
or
not
much
more
than
overnight
was
not
unreasonable
under
the
circumstances,
particularly
when
it
was
the
consequence
of
the
fact
that
the
officers
were
trying
to
do
their
duty
carefully
and
thoughtfully,
were
seeking
to
obtain
a
search
warrant,
were
trying
to
discover
the
facts
so
that
if
there
was
no
basis
for
a
warrant,
that
would
not
be
obtained.
and
our
view
is
that
to
impose
a
requirement
that
you
must
send
the
things
on
and
then
try
to
catch
them
before
they're
delivered
would
be
too
technical,
required
too
much
expenditure
of
manpower,
too
much
risk
of
loss.
when
the
suspected
material
is
in
the
custody
of
the
united
states
and
rightly
so,
this
reasonable
--
this
period
seems
to
us
to
have
been
a
reasonable
one.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
mr.
justice,
i
thought
about
that
argument
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
say
that
gold
coins
as
such
are
contraband.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
suppose
any
united
states
citizen
who
has
a
collection
of
gold
coins,
can
legally
transmit
them
by
mail
to
somebody
else,
to
a
dealer
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
here,
we
have
only
the
suspicion
that
these
have
come
across
from
canada.
we
have
grounds
for
believing
that
they
have
come
across
from
canada
but
they
were
in
fact
deposited
in
a
united
states
post
office
60
miles
within
the
united
states.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
they
would
be
forfeited
under
the
customs
law,
mr.
justice,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
i
understand
that
there
are
exceptions
to
the
gold
statutes
and
regulations
under
which
coins
bona
fide
held
for
collecting
purposes
are
perfectly
legal.
indeed,
i
see
them
advertised
in
the
papers
and
i
think
that
for
$95.00,
you
can
now
buy
a
$20.00
gold
piece
which
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
there
was
an
exception
of
bona
fide
collectors'
items,
whether
that
was
due
to
the
fact
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that
raises
all
kinds
of
questions
about
self
incrimination
that
i
-–
that
i
don't
think
we
need
to
go
into
here.
in
some
ways,
the
case
which
seems
to
me
to
be
the
closest
is
the
terry
case,
it's
terry
against
ohio
decided
two
years
ago.
i
think
i
would
like,
before
referring
to
terry
case
however,
to
make
reference
to
mr.
justice
white's
dissenting
opinion
in
the
shamel
case
because
he
did,
there
deal
more
extensively
than
i've
been
able
to
find
any
place
else
with
what
i
regard
as
the
underlying
problem
here.
now,
it
is
true
that
he
was
using
it
as
an
argument
that
the
search
without
a
warrant
should
be
valid
and
he
was
in
the
minority
on
that,
and
we
are
not
contending
here
that
a
search
without
a
warrant
is
valid.
but
on
page
774
of
justice
white's
dissent,
he
said,
“when
there
must
almost
always
be
a
strong
possibility
that
confederates
of
the
arrested
man
will
in
the
meanwhile
remove
the
items
for
which
the
police
have
probable
cause
to
search.
and
on
page
775,
he
says,
“moreover,
had
the
police
simply
arrested
the
petitioner,
taken
him
off
to
the
station
house
and
later
returned
with
a
warrant,
it
seems
very
likely
that
the
petitioner's
wife,
who
in
view
of
petitioner's
generally
garrulous
nature
must
have
known
of
the
robbery,
would
have
removed
the
coins.
now,
our
position
is
that,
our
contention,
our
suggestion
is
that
that
argument
not
having
prevailed,
there
nevertheless
remains
open
this
question
which
i
call
of
the
opportunity
to
impose
the
stillstand.
now,
just
how
that
can
be
done,
what
manpower's
involved,
what
force
can
properly
be
used
remains
to
be
seen?
but
we
contend
here
that
in
a
different
situation
where
the
goods
are
already
in
the
custody
of
the
united
states,
having
been
confined
to
the
--
confided
to
the
united
states
mail
that
it
is
appropriate
for
the
officers
of
the
government
to
preserve
the
status
quo
while
the
warrant
is
being
carefully
and
thoughtfully
obtained.
now,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
terry
case
itself
because
that
is
a
case
which
goes
into
these
questions
of
unreasonable
search
and
seizure,
the
meaning
of
unreasonable
where
you
do
not
have
an
arrest
or
a
seizure
involved.
in
the
terry
case,
you
remember
the
problem
was
of
the
power
of
the
police
to
take
action
short
of
an
arrest
by
way
of
what
is
popularly
known
as
stop
and
frisk,
by
way
of
patting
a
man's
clothes
to
see
whether
he
was
armed
and
on
finding
a
hard
object,
reaching
in
and
removing
it.
and
in
that
opinion,
chief
justice
warren
discussed
at
some
length
the
difference
between
the
cause
required
to
obtain
a
search
warrant,
which
would
be
probable
cause
to
--
or
an
arrest
warrant,
it
would
be
in
that
case
-–
a
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
crime
had
been
committed
and
the
cause
which
was
required
for
a
police
officer
to
take
this
interlocutory
step.
and
it
really
comes
down
to
this,
whether
there
was
probable
cause
for
suspicion
with
respect
to
the
commission
of
a
crime
and
the
safety
of
the
police
officer.
i
won't
take
the
time
to
quote
from
that
opinion,
particularly
on
pages
21
to
24.
only
by
way
of
analogy,
but
by
considerable
analogy,
there
is
discussion
of
this
shorter
step
of
this
step
short
of
an
arrest
or
of
a
procedure
and
we
feel
that
there
is
a
substantial
support
in
the
terry
case
for
the
proposition
that
the
step
taken
here,
and
the
only
step
against
which
complaint
is
made
is
the
holding
of
the
package
for
29
hours
and
it
would've
had
to
be
held
for
a
substantial
portion
of
that
at
the
very
best,
but
that
was
not
unreasonable.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
there's
no
question
of
safety
here,
but
it
is
suggested
that
the
only
duty
of
a
post
office
clerk
is
to
send
the
package
on
forth
with
and
i
suggested
if
on
the
exam
--
on
handling
the
package
in
the
process
of
putting
it
into
the
mail
bag
and
he
hears
it
ticking
that
he
may
find
it
quite
reasonably
that
he
has
some
duty
other
than
to
send
it
on
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
perhaps
not.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
terry
is
a
precise
analogy.
i
am
suggesting
that
it
is
an
application
of
–-
or
a
determination
of
what
is
reasonable
conduct
under
the
circumstances,
and
our
suggestion
is
that
in
this
case,
not
involving
a
communication,
nothing
about
the
first
amendment,
simply
goods
in
transit
but
to
delay
them
for
a
day
in
the
process
of
being
careful
in
seeking
a
search
warrant
and
then
seeking
a
search
warrant
through
the
judgment
of
an
independent
magistrate
is
not
such
unreasonable
conduct
as
to
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
suppose
it
is
with
the
stop
and
the
search,
although
the
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
of
course,
the
stop
is
only
for
seconds.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
long
enough
to
ask
him
with
questions
and
we
have
a
somewhat
longer
time
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
just
two
points
that
i
would
like
to
make.
mr.
davis
has
referred
to
statutes
which
required
the
mail,
as
he
has
said
to
be
forwarded
promptly.
actually,
the
statute
is
printed
at
the
bottom
of
page
2
of
the
appendix
to
his
brief,
section
710
of
title
39
of
the
united
states
code
and
it
reads,
“letters
brought
for
mailing
to
a
post
office
and
so
forth
shall
be
sent
on.
this
of
course
was
not
a
letter.
i
don't
regard
this
as
of
any
great
importance,
but
i
do
not
think
there
was
any
violation
of
that
statute
in
this
case.
and
the
other
point
i
would
make
is
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
sorry,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
this
is
an
internal
housekeeping
part
of
the
post
office
statute,
a
direction
to
postal
employees.
there
are
other
statutory
provisions
which
make
it
a
crime
with
penalties
attached
to
interfere
with
the
mails,
but
i
understand
them
to
be
directed
to
outsiders,
to
persons
who
obstruct
the
mails
in
one
way
or
another
and
not
to
postal
employees.
now,
the
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
simply
this.
it
would
seem
that
mr.
davis'
real
complaint
is
that
the
warrant
was
not
obtained
on
march
28,
rather
on
march
29.
i
think
it
could
be
that
warrant
could
have
been
obtained
on
march
28
and
that
i
don't
think
i
would
have
too
much
difficulty
in
seeking
to
defend
it
here,
if
it
had
been.
i
would
point
out
that
the
information
then
available
related
to
only
one
of
the
packages,
which
might
have
been
enough
to
establish
a
crime,
but
not
enough
to
seize
the
other
package.
what
i
would
hope
would
be
that
the
court
would
leave
a
little
leeway
here,
not
to
setup
a
rule
which
would
mean
that
the
instant
you
really
now
have
enough,
you
must
then
and
there
go
in
and
get
it
because
the
lines
are
not
easy
to
draw
here.
they
are
hard
to
draw
long
after
the
event
and
the
calm
deliberation
of
this
court.
they
are
much
harder
to
draw
for
the
individual
officer
on
the
scene
who
has
to
decide
whether
“well,
if
i
go
in
now,
will
it
be
found
that
i
did
not
have
enough?
here,
the
officer
was
careful.
he
did
no
harm
in
the
process
of
being
careful.
it
seems
to
me
he
ought
to
be
commended
for
having
done
a
fine
work
and
that
the
delay
which
was
involved
was
reasonable
and
should
not
be
held
to
invalidate
the
seizure
in
this
case.
