mr.
craig
g.
davis
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
find
this
argument
most
interesting
as
presented.
i
wish
i
could
concur
wholeheartedly.
were
i
to
concur
this
case
would
be
moot
and
in
the
court
i
would
seek
to
have
it
dismissed,
but
i
submit
that
is
not
the
case.
i
will
try
and
hit
the
points
as
we
go
along
very
carefully.
first
of
all,
let
me
point
out
with
tongue
and
cheek
as
did
judge
chambers
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
i,
too,
am
not
too
much
dismayed
by
delay
of
my
mail
because
oftentimes,
it
is
delayed
for
longer
than
29
hours.
but
he
held
in
concurring
opinion
that
this
was
done
without
judicial
authority
here
and
that
the
delay
was
intentional.
now,
i
submit
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
intentional
delay
of
one's
mail
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
delay
of
one's
mail
which
is
unintentional.
let
us
review
the
facts
in
this
very
carefully.
time
is
of
the
essence
in
this
case.
first,
let
me
point
out
that
vancouver,
british
columbia
is
but
60
miles
from
mt.
vernon.
i
know
i've
traveled
this
distance
to
be
here
with
you
today.
i
know
that
it
takes
but
one
hour
with
maybe
a
few
minutes
at
customs
to
come
across.
i
do
know
that
one
must
declare
items
at
the
border.
we
do
know
that
these
packages
were
9
and
11
lbs.
respectively,
and
we
see
that
the
petitioner's
name
or
rather
the
respondent's
name
is
gerritt
johannes
van
leeuwen.
i
ask
you
to
look
at
that
name,
g.j.
van
leeuwen,
and
he
used
as
a
non
de
plume,
as
a
return
address
g.j.
williams.
i
have
found
no
law,
no
case
authority,
and
though
i'm
lawfully
ignorant,
but
i
find
nothing
to
tell
me
that
i
cannot
use
a
non
de
plume
in
sending
out
a
package.
he
has
used
an
address
that
is
proper,
but
i
submit
that
i
can
use
your
return
address
if
i
so
wish
and
have
my
mail
returned
there.
i
know
of
no
law
saying
i
cannot
use
your
own
home
address
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
sir,
if
it
were
brought
to
the
law
enforcement
officer's
attention
by
yourself
and
my
using
your
return
address,
i
would
say
yes,
it
should
be
in
their
hands,
but
otherwise,
i
would
say
it
is
not
their
business.
they
have
no
reason
to
be
inquiring.
furthermore,
if
we
have
a
situation
where,
as
we
have
here,
that
a
man
declares
them
to
be
coins,
and
i
would
suggest
that
mr.
justice
stewart
do
not
mail
that
coin
through
the
mail
as
it
may
be
smuggled,
he
hasn't
checked
it
out
yet
because
if
it
were,
he
may
be
in
the
same
position
that
van
leeuwen
is,
but
coins
are
legal
here
in
the
united
states
as
numismatic
items.
this
man
declared
this
package
to
contain
coins;
he
did
not
lie.
he
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
declare
them
to
be
gold
coins.
he
did
not
declare
them
to
be
brought
across
the
border
and
testimony
at
the
trial
interestingly
enough
showed
that
the
packages
are
sitting
on
the
counsel
car
right
between
the
two
passengers.
now,
mind
you,
he's
mailing
this
at
1:30.
here
we
are
in
a
small
post
office,
a
first
class
post
office,
a
focal
gathering
point
for
all
of
skagit
county,
and
he's
mailing
two
packages
registered
mail.
now,
what's
so
unusual
about
registered
mail?
if
you
had
an
item
so
valuable,
certainly
you
would
register
it
because
the
maximum
insured
value
is
$200.00,
unless
you
declare
otherwise.
wouldn't
you
insure
your
coin
collection?
certainly,
any
one
of
us
would.
but
the
postal
clerk
is
suspicious,
the
return
address
is
not
one
that
is
occupied.
how
he
happens
to
know
this,
probably
because
it's
a
small
community.
probably
because
this
is
a
student
housing
center
for
the
junior
college
there.
this
may
be
how
he
knows
it,
and
there
are
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i'm
addressing
my
own
remarks,
sir,
not
only
to
the
lack
of
probable
cause
because
i'm
attacking
this
on
two
basis.
one,
the
affidavit
being
insufficient
and
two,
the
detention
of
the
packages
for
29
hours,
either
one
of
which
i
submit
would
be
more
than
sufficient
to
confirm
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
oh,
very
definitely,
sir,
very
definitely.
i
would
look
as
concerned
as
any
law
officer
who
had
these
facts
before
him,
who
would
not
seek
to
entertain
further
doubts
and
would
not
seek
to
resolve
this.
i
would
question
his
integrity.
no,
these
are
all
very
pertinent.
they
are
cumulative
snowball
effect,
but
i
submit
that
the
snowball
is
around
the
government,
and
here's
why.
these
facts
were
known,
1:30
he
mails
it.
these
facts
were
known
to
captain
belgard
who
in
turn
calls
the
rcmp
in
vancouver
because
there
had
been
a
recent
burglary
of
a
coin
shop
up
there;
he
just
checked.
rcmp
in
turn
does
a
quick
cursory
investigation,
calls
customs
officer
o'hearn
in
seattle,
chief
agent-in-charge.
this
by
2:30.
he
relates
the
following
facts
to
customs
officer
o'hearn,
(1)
two
packages,
(2)
gold
coins,
(3)
fictitious
address,
(4)
fictitious
addressee,
(5)
registered
mail,
(6)
return
addressees.
o'hearn,
being
the
superlative
agent
that
he
is,
immediately
gets
on
the
phone
and
calls
van
nuys,
california
and
ascertains
that
one
of
these
addressees
is
a
suspected
trafficker
on
illegally
obtained
gold
coins.
how
can
a
man
work
faster?
i
take
my
hat
off
to
him
and
i
submit
at
this
time,
he
had
probable
cause
to
get
a
search
warrant.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
five
hours?
no
sir,
he
worked
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
…faster
than
that.
one
hour
and
five
minutes.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
one
hour
and
five
minutes.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i
find
nothing
wrong.
in
fact,
i
find
it
to
be
very
commendable.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
24
hours
later,
it
did.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
it
does,
sir.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
considering
the
fact
that
the
affidavit
was
applied
for
at
approximately
2:30
pm
the
following
day,
i
think
the
affidavit
could
have
been
applied
on
the
day
that
the
packages
were
mailed,
considering
that
mt.
vernon
is
60
miles
from
seattle,
a
drive
of
one
hour
on
a
super
freeway.
i
think
it
could
have
been
done
then,
and
it
should
have
been
submitted
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
no
sir,
about
2:30,
we
have
the
facts.
2:35,
o'hearn
has
verified
that
one
of
the
addressees
is
a
suspected
trafficker
of
gold
coins.
his
office,
he
would
have
to
call,
and
he
did
call,
the
attorney
general's
office
and
one
of
the
assistants
ags
made
out
this
affidavit.
i
know,
he's
my
classmate.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i
am
complaining
about
the
additional
24
hours,
very
definitely
sir,
because
there,
that
is
sloppy
police
work.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
how
did
it
injure
my
client?
he
spent
one
year
in
prison.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
other
than
that,
the
fourth
amendment
protects
our
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
it
affected
his
constitutional
rights,
and
that
this
court
way
long
ago
in
ex
parte
jackson,
held
that
the
first
class
mails
are
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
and
have
the
same
rights
as
those
possessions
within
our
own
private
homes
and
that
those
rights
have
been
violated.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
then
i
shouldn't
be
here,
sir.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
excuse
me?
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i
am
complaining
about
the
timing.
i'm
complaining
very
vehemently
about
the
timing.
a
mail
watch
could
have
been
put
on
those
packages.
they
knew
the
addressees.
telephone
communications
being
what
they
are,
they
could've
quickly
gotten
the
same
information,
which
i
submit
incidentally
as
a
sideline.
it
is
hearsay
on
ear
say,
but
they
could've
gotten
that
same
information
down
and
the
same
type
of
affidavit
could
have
been
written
up
in
california
and
again,
in
nashville,
tennessee.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
lost,
yes,
and
this
is
what
chief
--
or
what
judge
chambers
referred
to
that
oftentimes,
my
mail
goes
astray,
but
i
submit
that
this
was
not
lost.
the
government
has
admitted
that
they
contained
it.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
they
had
two
packages,
sir.
they
surely
would
have
caught
one,
but
even
our
post
office
is
that
inefficient.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
sir?
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i'm
saying
at
that
point,
there
was
probable
cause.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
there
was.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i
am
not
saying
as
i
understand
it,
sir,
that
it
is
not
supported
by
a
probably
cause.
i
am
saying
that
according
to
the
guidelines
laid
down
in
ventresca
that
that
affidavit
is
hearsay,
based
on
hearsay.
it
does
not
meet
the
requirements
in
it.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
that
is
correct,
sir.
i'm
not
saying
they
do
not
have
probable
cause,
if
they
had
the
proper
source
information
related,
which
they
did
not
do.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
now,
here
we
have
these
packages
supposedly
on
their
way.
first
class
mail
according
to
the
united
states
postal
code
must
be,
when
it
is
mailed
half
an
hour
before
the
next
outgoing
shipment,
included
in
that
shipment.
here,
we
have
two
packages
which
are
fortuitously,
and
i
submit
now
as
a
forethought,
set
aside
to
await
a
search
warrant.
here
are
two
packages
that
should
have
been
going
on
their
way,
and
the
only
other
thing
that
officer
o'hearn
has
learned
the
following
morning
is
that
van
leeuwen
admitted
to
a
canadian
money
that
he'd
mailed
those
packages
and
secondly,
that
the
second
addressee
was
a
suspected
trafficker
in
gold
coins,
cumulative
evidence,
that
is
all,
cumulative.
it
adds
but
a
snowflake
to
the
snowball.
now,
what
happens
next?
the
search
warrant
is
issued
and
if
you
look
very
carefully
at
the
search
warrant,
at
the
affidavit
on
page
5,
you'll
note
that
the
affiant
has
information
through
united
states
customs
channels.
it
doesn't
tell
us
where.
each
and
every
one
of
these
facts
is
set
forth.
frankly,
i
was
amazed
that
i
was
not
upheld
at
the
trial,
i
will,
but
i
was
not,
and
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
even
reach
this
issue.
so
i
must
submit
it
again
for
this
court's
consideration.
but
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
this
affidavit
is
a
good
one.
let's
assume
that
it
is
not
subject
to
attack.
let
us
assume
that
it
meets
the
requirements
of
ventresca.
then,
i
submit
to
you
that
you
were
saying
to
me
that
postal
regulations
and
postal
statutes
don't
mean
a
thing.
a
statute
of
united
states
government,
when
it
applies
to
the
government,
has
no
meaning.
when
applied
to
a
private
citizen,
they
certainly
clamp
down
on
us
and
yet,
statutory
law
itself
says
that
the
mail
shall
not
be
detained
by
any
individual
whatsoever,
and
yet
these
mails
were
detained.
it
tells
who
may
give
information
from
them,
and
yet
–-
and
that
would
be
the
postal
clerk
to
a
post
office
inspector,
look
in
the
interim
here.
we
have
these
packages
going
to
captain
belgard,
to
a
fireman
yet,
and
i
haven't
figured
that
one
out
yet
and
last
but
not
least,
to
customs
officer
o'hearn.
where
is
the
postal
inspector
who's
given
the
information?
if
he
had
done
so,
then
i
wouldn't
be
here,
but
he
didn't.
there
is
no
postal
inspector
involved
yet.
where
do
we
draw
--
mr.
craig
g.
davis
they
do,
sir.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i
don't
know
about
permanently,
but
i
know
there
was
one
involved
because
he
did
sign
and
witness
the
return
on
the
search
warrant.
why
it
is
that
the
government
waited
so
long,
i
honestly
do
not
know.
perhaps
it
was
seeking
more
evidence
than
it
had,
but
i
submit
to
you
that
this
is
the
beginning.
this
case
could
be
the
wedge,
and
let
us
not
have
a
wedge.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
if
the
court
please,
the
wedge
i
had
for
lunch
was
not
the
one
i
was
instructing
the
court
on
i
hope.
the
wedge
i
am
thinking
of
is
the
specter
preventive
detention.
that
specter
arises
in
this
case.
if
the
government
is
allowed
to
detain
property,
safeguard
it
under
our
constitution
for
29
hours,
then
it's
but
a
short
step
to
the
preventive
detention
of
the
individual.
and
i
can
only
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i
leave
it
in
your
able
hands,
sir.
i'm
sure
it
will
be
taken
care
in
this
case,
too.
but
the
thing
that
does
trouble
me
more
than
anything
else
is
that
we
have
a
situation
where
a
man
does
mail
something,
first
class
mail.
by
definition,
first
class
mail,
and
the
issue
is
raised
that
there
is
no
delay
of
printed
or
written
matter.
this
is
true,
but
i
ask
of
what
relevance
is
it.
after
all,
yesterday,
i
had
the
pleasure
of
viewing
the
whole
diamond
which
was
sent
by
registered
mail
and
surely,
there
would've
been
some
question
asked
if
it
hadn't
made
it
to
its
destination,
but
then,
we
have
a
few
other
items
that
intrigued
me.
the
shamel
case
was
brought
up,
and
this
dealt
as
i
recall
it
with
the
stop
and
frisk
of
an
individual.
granted
this
whole
thing's
put
at
standstill
for
a
moment,
but
for
a
moment.
then
it
was
dealing
with
something
inherently
dangerous,
and
that
is
that
the
man
has
something
that
could
prove
dangerous
to
the
officer
investigating.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
terry,
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir,
thank
you.
but
this
is
a
case
where
the
post
office
employees
with
others
maintain
the
status
quo,
and
i
would
submit
to
you
that
the
postal
authorities
have
no
such
authority.
i
have
cited
several
statutes
in
the
appendix
to
my
brief.
i'd
ask
the
court
to
review
them
carefully
because
they
deal
with
this
particular
issue.
what
can
the
post
office
do?
i
have
no
qualms
whatsoever
with
the
government's
argument
as
to
the
detention
of
personal
property
for
a
short
period
of
time
needed
to
get
a
search
warrant.
but
i
submit
that
the
short
period
of
time
of
29
hours,
24
hours
after
the
facts
necessary
to
get
a
search
warrant
issued,
this
is
short.
i
cannot
buy
that
argument.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
if
no
magistrate
were
available
for
29
hours
and
this
could
be
shown,
then
i
think
there
we
have
mitigating
circumstances
but
i
still
would
not
like
to
say
categorically
that
this
is
reasonable
because
always,
there
is
a
judge
available,
if
not,
a
commissioner
and
in
this
case,
there
is
a
commissioner
available
not
only
in
seattle
but
in
bellingham.
there
are
three
judges
there
in
seattle.
any
one
of
them
could
have
issued
this.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
and
this
court,
i'm
surely
–-
for
sure
would
have
issued
a
warrant
on
the
facts
that
they
knew
at
2:35.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
that
i
cannot
do.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
this
is
not
my
only
complaint,
sir.
it
is
the
primary
complaint.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
that
is
correct.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
my
complaint
is
that
they
didn't
do
it
in
two
or
three
hours
but
did
it
in
25
to
27
hours.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
if
i
may
analogize
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
first,
no
one
knew
that
this
was
gold.
secondly,
we
hit
a
problem
here
in
that
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
the
damage
that
was
done
to
him
was
that
guarantee
of
our
constitution
under
the
fourth
amendment
which
applies
to
any
man
legally
in
this
country,
being
a
foreign
national
as
this
man
was,
a
petty
subject
or
not.
and
when
the
constitution
tells
me,
and
i
am
to
advise
my
client
that
his
rights
are
protected
and
his
papers
and
his
personal
effects
are
protected
against
an
illegal
seizure,
and
that
this
also
applies
to
the
mails
but
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i
don't
know
that
the
fourth
amendment
speaks
on
this
particular
issue.
i
would
submit
that
it
is
a
matter
of
reasonableness,
sir
and
the
question
arises
where
do
reasonable
men
differ?
on
the
matter
of
a
few
hours,
we
can
differ,
but
when
we
all
have
before
us
the
facts
necessary
to
issue
a
search
warrant
on
the
same
day
that
the
packages
are
mailed
and
we
dilly-dally
for
an
additional
24
hours,
then
i
submit
that
this
is
unreasonable
and
it's
merely
a
matter
of
where
do
we
get
reasonableness.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i
do,
sir.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
that
is
correct.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
sir,
that
problem
arises
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
true,
but
the
problem
arises
this
way.
this
is
an
analogy
under
the
fourth
amendment.
we're
talking
about
mail,
but
if
the
court
should
find
that
an
additional
24
hours
before
the
issuance
of
a
search
warrant
is
perfectly
proper,
then
can't
we
analogize
this
to
all
other
situations
covered
by
the
fourth
amendment.
therefore,
when
the
police
have
reason
to
believe
that
i
have
heroine
stashed
in
my
home
and
i
am
not
there,
it
having
been
just
delivered
in,
but
still
under
my
control
being
in
my
house,
and
they
surround
my
house
and
they
have
the
facts
necessary
within
four
hours,
they
can
keep
me
out
of
my
home
for
an
additional
24
hours
while
they
are
gathering
one
additional
fact
that
isn't
even
pertinent?
that's
what
would
happen
if
that
logic
and
reasoning
were
followed
through
to
the
end
and
i
submit
this
is
not
proper
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
if
the
heroine
were
in
the
package
at
the
post
office,
they
have
no
right
whatsoever
to
open
it,
and
that
happened
in
one
case,
once
where
a
package
did
open.
in
fact,
two
cases.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
oh
no,
sir.
you
certainly
can
open
it
if
you
have
a
search
warrant.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
they
got
a
search
warrant
but
when
did
they
get
that
search
warrant?
to
do
so,
sir,
they
had
to
violate
three
different
statutes
and
several
regulations.
the
statutes
are
as
follows.
one,
the
mail
must
go
out
the
next
outgoing
shipment,
and
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i
wish
you
did,
sir.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
it
would
be
nice
if
it
were,
but
on
this
particular
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
there
is
nothing
for
damages.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
that's
true,
but
there
i
submit
to
you,
sir,
that
this
is
an
unintentional
holding
up.
if
you
knew
that
your
mail
were
intentionally
being
delayed
and
such
would
be
the
outcome
of
this
case
whereas
the
court
of
appeals
overturned,
then
your
mail,
my
mail
and
every
man's
mail
may
be
detained
for
a
total
of
29
hours
at
least
until
they
investigate
to
see
shall
we
send
it
on
or
shall
we
not.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i'll
take
your
word
for
it,
sir.
i
see
an
inspector
there
that
bothers
me
though.
it
troubles
me
deeply
to
know
that
in
this
day
of
communications
where
we're
constantly
supplying
the
police
with
more
inaccurate
means
of
obtaining
information
that
we
turn
around
and
give
them
the
same
leeway
that
they
perhaps
had
a
century
ago
when
it
isn't
necessary,
but
no
longer
is
necessary
nor
is
it
accountable.
now,
they
could've
gotten
a
warrant
and
searched
the
packages
at
the
other
end.
certainly,
they
could.
now
after
all,
if
the
mail
is
delayed
en
route
without
a
purposeful
detention,
it
would
in
our
knowledge
take
them
two
or
three
days
to
get
back
east,
or
to
california
for
that
matter.
they
know
the
addressee.
certainly,
they
had
time
to
pick
up
these
packages
at
that
time.
why
didn't
they
do
so?
doesn't
this
open
up
the
possibility
of
forum
shopping
for
a
magistrate
who
will
issue
a
search
warrant?
are
we
going
to
allow
this?
i
would
submit
that
it
is
not
allowable.
now,
one
issue
that
was
brought
up
by
the
solicitor
general,
he
said
that
it's
not
being
pressed
as
hearsay.
i
am
pressing
hearsay
to
the
fullest
extent
possible.
this
affidavit,
a
careful
analysis
shows
it
is
based
hearsay
on
hearsay.
it
violates
every
rule
laid
down
in
this
court
in
ventresca
and
in
jones
as
analyzed
by
justice
douglas.
it
doesn't
meet
these
requirements,
but
i
must
assume
arguendo
that
it
does
meet
them,
and
then
we
get
to
the
detention.
now,
another
thing
was
the
suspicion
that
these
coins
came
across
from
canada.
well,
if
they
came
from
within
the
united
states,
we
wouldn't
be
here
because
there
is
no
law
that
says
you
cannot
have
coins,
gold
coins
as
collector's
item
in
the
united
states.
in
fact,
since
this
case
first
came
about,
our
laws
have
grown
greatly
less
strict
as
to
the
handling
and
having
of
gold
coins.
now,
we
do
not
contend
that
the
search
was
without
a
warrant
--
without
a
warrant
is
valid.
this
is
true
that
the
government
does
not
contend
this,
but
yet,
what
do
we
have?
we
have
essentially
a
seizure
without
a
warrant.
a
seizure
not
for
the
few
hours
which
the
government
says
is
necessary
to
obtain
a
search
warrant,
but
a
seizure
for
many
hours
after
we
have
these
facts.
now,
is
this
plausible?
is
it
reasonable?
can
reasonable
men
even
differ
on
this
point?
but
now,
we
have
one
further
argument,
and
that
is
where
the
goods
are
already
in
the
custody
of
the
united
states,
is
it
okay
to
preserve
the
status
quo
while
the
warrant
is
being
obtained,
and
i
would
ask
you
why?
why
is
such
an
argument?
why
is
it
reasonable?
these
packages
are
placed
with
the
united
states
post
office
in
a
form
of
trust.
our
mail
system,
our
whole
system
of
communications
in
the
united
states
would
break
down
without
that
trust,
and
i
submit
that
there's
been
a
violation
of
statutory
law
laid
down
by
the
congress
and
of
cong
–-
or
of
regulations
put
down
by
the
postmaster
general.
and
i
know
that
i,
as
a
taxpayer,
if
i
violate
a
title
of
the
taxes
or
any
of
the
regulations,
i
stand
a
chance
to
be
here
on
the
regulations,
but
on
the
title,
it's
questionable.
i
will
normally
be
knocked
down
and
yet
here
we
are
saying
in
effect,
you,
the
government,
can
do
this
and
your
hands
will
not
be
slapped.
but
when
a
private
individual
do
so,
that
he
will
have
a
$5,000.00
fine
or
five
years
in
jail
and
i
ask
you,
aren't
we
all
men
equal
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
foreigner
or
citizen?
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i
would
not
be
making
this
argument,
sir.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
the
difference
is
the
amount
of
time
in
which
it
is
done,
where
reasonable
cause
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
the
postal
re
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
this
is
correct
but
we
have
here
the
issue
raised,
we
must
detain
while
we
obtain
a
search
warrant,
and
i
submit
that
it's
already
in
the
government's
hands.
they
have
it
--
mr.
craig
g.
davis
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
craig
g.
davis
it
takes
airmail,
for
my
brief,
to
reach
this
city
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
…approximately
three
days,
and
these
were
sent
airmail.
so
i
would
imagine
three
days
to
reach
mobile,
alabama.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
that's
correct,
but
the
question
is
do
we
begin
at
the
beginning
or
at
the
end,
and
i
submit
that
the
government
began
in
the
wrong
fashion
in
this
case.
that's
the
whole
problem.
i
don't
fault
the
government
for
the
work
done.
i
fault
them
for
the
way
in
which
they
did
it.
this
man
is
guilty.
justice
was
done;
he
did
a
year
in
prison.
he's
on
parole
now.
i
have
no
qualms
about
his
having
been
in.
i
know
he
was
guilty.
he's
admitted
it,
but
i
submit
that
the
law
now
must
be
kept
straightened
out
as
the
court
of
appeals
has
so
found.
thank
you.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
find
this
argument
most
interesting
as
presented.
i
wish
i
could
concur
wholeheartedly.
were
i
to
concur
this
case
would
be
moot
and
in
the
court
i
would
seek
to
have
it
dismissed,
but
i
submit
that
is
not
the
case.
i
will
try
and
hit
the
points
as
we
go
along
very
carefully.
first
of
all,
let
me
point
out
with
tongue
and
cheek
as
did
judge
chambers
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
i,
too,
am
not
too
much
dismayed
by
delay
of
my
mail
because
oftentimes,
it
is
delayed
for
longer
than
29
hours.
but
he
held
in
concurring
opinion
that
this
was
done
without
judicial
authority
here
and
that
the
delay
was
intentional.
now,
i
submit
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
intentional
delay
of
one's
mail
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
delay
of
one's
mail
which
is
unintentional.
let
us
review
the
facts
in
this
very
carefully.
time
is
of
the
essence
in
this
case.
first,
let
me
point
out
that
vancouver,
british
columbia
is
but
60
miles
from
mt.
vernon.
i
know
i've
traveled
this
distance
to
be
here
with
you
today.
i
know
that
it
takes
but
one
hour
with
maybe
a
few
minutes
at
customs
to
come
across.
i
do
know
that
one
must
declare
items
at
the
border.
we
do
know
that
these
packages
were
9
and
11
lbs.
respectively,
and
we
see
that
the
petitioner's
name
or
rather
the
respondent's
name
is
gerritt
johannes
van
leeuwen.
i
ask
you
to
look
at
that
name,
g.j.
van
leeuwen,
and
he
used
as
a
non
de
plume,
as
a
return
address
g.j.
williams.
i
have
found
no
law,
no
case
authority,
and
though
i'm
lawfully
ignorant,
but
i
find
nothing
to
tell
me
that
i
cannot
use
a
non
de
plume
in
sending
out
a
package.
he
has
used
an
address
that
is
proper,
but
i
submit
that
i
can
use
your
return
address
if
i
so
wish
and
have
my
mail
returned
there.
i
know
of
no
law
saying
i
cannot
use
your
own
home
address
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
sir,
if
it
were
brought
to
the
law
enforcement
officer's
attention
by
yourself
and
my
using
your
return
address,
i
would
say
yes,
it
should
be
in
their
hands,
but
otherwise,
i
would
say
it
is
not
their
business.
they
have
no
reason
to
be
inquiring.
furthermore,
if
we
have
a
situation
where,
as
we
have
here,
that
a
man
declares
them
to
be
coins,
and
i
would
suggest
that
mr.
justice
stewart
do
not
mail
that
coin
through
the
mail
as
it
may
be
smuggled,
he
hasn't
checked
it
out
yet
because
if
it
were,
he
may
be
in
the
same
position
that
van
leeuwen
is,
but
coins
are
legal
here
in
the
united
states
as
numismatic
items.
this
man
declared
this
package
to
contain
coins;
he
did
not
lie.
he
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
declare
them
to
be
gold
coins.
he
did
not
declare
them
to
be
brought
across
the
border
and
testimony
at
the
trial
interestingly
enough
showed
that
the
packages
are
sitting
on
the
counsel
car
right
between
the
two
passengers.
now,
mind
you,
he's
mailing
this
at
1:30.
here
we
are
in
a
small
post
office,
a
first
class
post
office,
a
focal
gathering
point
for
all
of
skagit
county,
and
he's
mailing
two
packages
registered
mail.
now,
what's
so
unusual
about
registered
mail?
if
you
had
an
item
so
valuable,
certainly
you
would
register
it
because
the
maximum
insured
value
is
$200.00,
unless
you
declare
otherwise.
wouldn't
you
insure
your
coin
collection?
certainly,
any
one
of
us
would.
but
the
postal
clerk
is
suspicious,
the
return
address
is
not
one
that
is
occupied.
how
he
happens
to
know
this,
probably
because
it's
a
small
community.
probably
because
this
is
a
student
housing
center
for
the
junior
college
there.
this
may
be
how
he
knows
it,
and
there
are
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i'm
addressing
my
own
remarks,
sir,
not
only
to
the
lack
of
probable
cause
because
i'm
attacking
this
on
two
basis.
one,
the
affidavit
being
insufficient
and
two,
the
detention
of
the
packages
for
29
hours,
either
one
of
which
i
submit
would
be
more
than
sufficient
to
confirm
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
oh,
very
definitely,
sir,
very
definitely.
i
would
look
as
concerned
as
any
law
officer
who
had
these
facts
before
him,
who
would
not
seek
to
entertain
further
doubts
and
would
not
seek
to
resolve
this.
i
would
question
his
integrity.
no,
these
are
all
very
pertinent.
they
are
cumulative
snowball
effect,
but
i
submit
that
the
snowball
is
around
the
government,
and
here's
why.
these
facts
were
known,
1:30
he
mails
it.
these
facts
were
known
to
captain
belgard
who
in
turn
calls
the
rcmp
in
vancouver
because
there
had
been
a
recent
burglary
of
a
coin
shop
up
there;
he
just
checked.
rcmp
in
turn
does
a
quick
cursory
investigation,
calls
customs
officer
o'hearn
in
seattle,
chief
agent-in-charge.
this
by
2:30.
he
relates
the
following
facts
to
customs
officer
o'hearn,
(1)
two
packages,
(2)
gold
coins,
(3)
fictitious
address,
(4)
fictitious
addressee,
(5)
registered
mail,
(6)
return
addressees.
o'hearn,
being
the
superlative
agent
that
he
is,
immediately
gets
on
the
phone
and
calls
van
nuys,
california
and
ascertains
that
one
of
these
addressees
is
a
suspected
trafficker
on
illegally
obtained
gold
coins.
how
can
a
man
work
faster?
i
take
my
hat
off
to
him
and
i
submit
at
this
time,
he
had
probable
cause
to
get
a
search
warrant.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
five
hours?
no
sir,
he
worked
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
…faster
than
that.
one
hour
and
five
minutes.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
one
hour
and
five
minutes.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i
find
nothing
wrong.
in
fact,
i
find
it
to
be
very
commendable.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
24
hours
later,
it
did.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
it
does,
sir.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
considering
the
fact
that
the
affidavit
was
applied
for
at
approximately
2:30
pm
the
following
day,
i
think
the
affidavit
could
have
been
applied
on
the
day
that
the
packages
were
mailed,
considering
that
mt.
vernon
is
60
miles
from
seattle,
a
drive
of
one
hour
on
a
super
freeway.
i
think
it
could
have
been
done
then,
and
it
should
have
been
submitted
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
no
sir,
about
2:30,
we
have
the
facts.
2:35,
o'hearn
has
verified
that
one
of
the
addressees
is
a
suspected
trafficker
of
gold
coins.
his
office,
he
would
have
to
call,
and
he
did
call,
the
attorney
general's
office
and
one
of
the
assistants
ags
made
out
this
affidavit.
i
know,
he's
my
classmate.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i
am
complaining
about
the
additional
24
hours,
very
definitely
sir,
because
there,
that
is
sloppy
police
work.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
how
did
it
injure
my
client?
he
spent
one
year
in
prison.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
other
than
that,
the
fourth
amendment
protects
our
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
it
affected
his
constitutional
rights,
and
that
this
court
way
long
ago
in
ex
parte
jackson,
held
that
the
first
class
mails
are
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
and
have
the
same
rights
as
those
possessions
within
our
own
private
homes
and
that
those
rights
have
been
violated.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
then
i
shouldn't
be
here,
sir.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
excuse
me?
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i
am
complaining
about
the
timing.
i'm
complaining
very
vehemently
about
the
timing.
a
mail
watch
could
have
been
put
on
those
packages.
they
knew
the
addressees.
telephone
communications
being
what
they
are,
they
could've
quickly
gotten
the
same
information,
which
i
submit
incidentally
as
a
sideline.
it
is
hearsay
on
ear
say,
but
they
could've
gotten
that
same
information
down
and
the
same
type
of
affidavit
could
have
been
written
up
in
california
and
again,
in
nashville,
tennessee.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
lost,
yes,
and
this
is
what
chief
--
or
what
judge
chambers
referred
to
that
oftentimes,
my
mail
goes
astray,
but
i
submit
that
this
was
not
lost.
the
government
has
admitted
that
they
contained
it.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
they
had
two
packages,
sir.
they
surely
would
have
caught
one,
but
even
our
post
office
is
that
inefficient.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
sir?
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i'm
saying
at
that
point,
there
was
probable
cause.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
there
was.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i
am
not
saying
as
i
understand
it,
sir,
that
it
is
not
supported
by
a
probably
cause.
i
am
saying
that
according
to
the
guidelines
laid
down
in
ventresca
that
that
affidavit
is
hearsay,
based
on
hearsay.
it
does
not
meet
the
requirements
in
it.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
that
is
correct,
sir.
i'm
not
saying
they
do
not
have
probable
cause,
if
they
had
the
proper
source
information
related,
which
they
did
not
do.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
now,
here
we
have
these
packages
supposedly
on
their
way.
first
class
mail
according
to
the
united
states
postal
code
must
be,
when
it
is
mailed
half
an
hour
before
the
next
outgoing
shipment,
included
in
that
shipment.
here,
we
have
two
packages
which
are
fortuitously,
and
i
submit
now
as
a
forethought,
set
aside
to
await
a
search
warrant.
here
are
two
packages
that
should
have
been
going
on
their
way,
and
the
only
other
thing
that
officer
o'hearn
has
learned
the
following
morning
is
that
van
leeuwen
admitted
to
a
canadian
money
that
he'd
mailed
those
packages
and
secondly,
that
the
second
addressee
was
a
suspected
trafficker
in
gold
coins,
cumulative
evidence,
that
is
all,
cumulative.
it
adds
but
a
snowflake
to
the
snowball.
now,
what
happens
next?
the
search
warrant
is
issued
and
if
you
look
very
carefully
at
the
search
warrant,
at
the
affidavit
on
page
5,
you'll
note
that
the
affiant
has
information
through
united
states
customs
channels.
it
doesn't
tell
us
where.
each
and
every
one
of
these
facts
is
set
forth.
frankly,
i
was
amazed
that
i
was
not
upheld
at
the
trial,
i
will,
but
i
was
not,
and
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
even
reach
this
issue.
so
i
must
submit
it
again
for
this
court's
consideration.
but
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
this
affidavit
is
a
good
one.
let's
assume
that
it
is
not
subject
to
attack.
let
us
assume
that
it
meets
the
requirements
of
ventresca.
then,
i
submit
to
you
that
you
were
saying
to
me
that
postal
regulations
and
postal
statutes
don't
mean
a
thing.
a
statute
of
united
states
government,
when
it
applies
to
the
government,
has
no
meaning.
when
applied
to
a
private
citizen,
they
certainly
clamp
down
on
us
and
yet,
statutory
law
itself
says
that
the
mail
shall
not
be
detained
by
any
individual
whatsoever,
and
yet
these
mails
were
detained.
it
tells
who
may
give
information
from
them,
and
yet
–-
and
that
would
be
the
postal
clerk
to
a
post
office
inspector,
look
in
the
interim
here.
we
have
these
packages
going
to
captain
belgard,
to
a
fireman
yet,
and
i
haven't
figured
that
one
out
yet
and
last
but
not
least,
to
customs
officer
o'hearn.
where
is
the
postal
inspector
who's
given
the
information?
if
he
had
done
so,
then
i
wouldn't
be
here,
but
he
didn't.
there
is
no
postal
inspector
involved
yet.
where
do
we
draw
--
mr.
craig
g.
davis
they
do,
sir.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i
don't
know
about
permanently,
but
i
know
there
was
one
involved
because
he
did
sign
and
witness
the
return
on
the
search
warrant.
why
it
is
that
the
government
waited
so
long,
i
honestly
do
not
know.
perhaps
it
was
seeking
more
evidence
than
it
had,
but
i
submit
to
you
that
this
is
the
beginning.
this
case
could
be
the
wedge,
and
let
us
not
have
a
wedge.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
if
the
court
please,
the
wedge
i
had
for
lunch
was
not
the
one
i
was
instructing
the
court
on
i
hope.
the
wedge
i
am
thinking
of
is
the
specter
preventive
detention.
that
specter
arises
in
this
case.
if
the
government
is
allowed
to
detain
property,
safeguard
it
under
our
constitution
for
29
hours,
then
it's
but
a
short
step
to
the
preventive
detention
of
the
individual.
and
i
can
only
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i
leave
it
in
your
able
hands,
sir.
i'm
sure
it
will
be
taken
care
in
this
case,
too.
but
the
thing
that
does
trouble
me
more
than
anything
else
is
that
we
have
a
situation
where
a
man
does
mail
something,
first
class
mail.
by
definition,
first
class
mail,
and
the
issue
is
raised
that
there
is
no
delay
of
printed
or
written
matter.
this
is
true,
but
i
ask
of
what
relevance
is
it.
after
all,
yesterday,
i
had
the
pleasure
of
viewing
the
whole
diamond
which
was
sent
by
registered
mail
and
surely,
there
would've
been
some
question
asked
if
it
hadn't
made
it
to
its
destination,
but
then,
we
have
a
few
other
items
that
intrigued
me.
the
shamel
case
was
brought
up,
and
this
dealt
as
i
recall
it
with
the
stop
and
frisk
of
an
individual.
granted
this
whole
thing's
put
at
standstill
for
a
moment,
but
for
a
moment.
then
it
was
dealing
with
something
inherently
dangerous,
and
that
is
that
the
man
has
something
that
could
prove
dangerous
to
the
officer
investigating.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
terry,
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir,
thank
you.
but
this
is
a
case
where
the
post
office
employees
with
others
maintain
the
status
quo,
and
i
would
submit
to
you
that
the
postal
authorities
have
no
such
authority.
i
have
cited
several
statutes
in
the
appendix
to
my
brief.
i'd
ask
the
court
to
review
them
carefully
because
they
deal
with
this
particular
issue.
what
can
the
post
office
do?
i
have
no
qualms
whatsoever
with
the
government's
argument
as
to
the
detention
of
personal
property
for
a
short
period
of
time
needed
to
get
a
search
warrant.
but
i
submit
that
the
short
period
of
time
of
29
hours,
24
hours
after
the
facts
necessary
to
get
a
search
warrant
issued,
this
is
short.
i
cannot
buy
that
argument.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
if
no
magistrate
were
available
for
29
hours
and
this
could
be
shown,
then
i
think
there
we
have
mitigating
circumstances
but
i
still
would
not
like
to
say
categorically
that
this
is
reasonable
because
always,
there
is
a
judge
available,
if
not,
a
commissioner
and
in
this
case,
there
is
a
commissioner
available
not
only
in
seattle
but
in
bellingham.
there
are
three
judges
there
in
seattle.
any
one
of
them
could
have
issued
this.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
and
this
court,
i'm
surely
–-
for
sure
would
have
issued
a
warrant
on
the
facts
that
they
knew
at
2:35.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
that
i
cannot
do.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
this
is
not
my
only
complaint,
sir.
it
is
the
primary
complaint.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
that
is
correct.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
my
complaint
is
that
they
didn't
do
it
in
two
or
three
hours
but
did
it
in
25
to
27
hours.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
if
i
may
analogize
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
first,
no
one
knew
that
this
was
gold.
secondly,
we
hit
a
problem
here
in
that
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
the
damage
that
was
done
to
him
was
that
guarantee
of
our
constitution
under
the
fourth
amendment
which
applies
to
any
man
legally
in
this
country,
being
a
foreign
national
as
this
man
was,
a
petty
subject
or
not.
and
when
the
constitution
tells
me,
and
i
am
to
advise
my
client
that
his
rights
are
protected
and
his
papers
and
his
personal
effects
are
protected
against
an
illegal
seizure,
and
that
this
also
applies
to
the
mails
but
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i
don't
know
that
the
fourth
amendment
speaks
on
this
particular
issue.
i
would
submit
that
it
is
a
matter
of
reasonableness,
sir
and
the
question
arises
where
do
reasonable
men
differ?
on
the
matter
of
a
few
hours,
we
can
differ,
but
when
we
all
have
before
us
the
facts
necessary
to
issue
a
search
warrant
on
the
same
day
that
the
packages
are
mailed
and
we
dilly-dally
for
an
additional
24
hours,
then
i
submit
that
this
is
unreasonable
and
it's
merely
a
matter
of
where
do
we
get
reasonableness.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i
do,
sir.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
that
is
correct.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
sir,
that
problem
arises
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
true,
but
the
problem
arises
this
way.
this
is
an
analogy
under
the
fourth
amendment.
we're
talking
about
mail,
but
if
the
court
should
find
that
an
additional
24
hours
before
the
issuance
of
a
search
warrant
is
perfectly
proper,
then
can't
we
analogize
this
to
all
other
situations
covered
by
the
fourth
amendment.
therefore,
when
the
police
have
reason
to
believe
that
i
have
heroine
stashed
in
my
home
and
i
am
not
there,
it
having
been
just
delivered
in,
but
still
under
my
control
being
in
my
house,
and
they
surround
my
house
and
they
have
the
facts
necessary
within
four
hours,
they
can
keep
me
out
of
my
home
for
an
additional
24
hours
while
they
are
gathering
one
additional
fact
that
isn't
even
pertinent?
that's
what
would
happen
if
that
logic
and
reasoning
were
followed
through
to
the
end
and
i
submit
this
is
not
proper
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
if
the
heroine
were
in
the
package
at
the
post
office,
they
have
no
right
whatsoever
to
open
it,
and
that
happened
in
one
case,
once
where
a
package
did
open.
in
fact,
two
cases.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
oh
no,
sir.
you
certainly
can
open
it
if
you
have
a
search
warrant.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
they
got
a
search
warrant
but
when
did
they
get
that
search
warrant?
to
do
so,
sir,
they
had
to
violate
three
different
statutes
and
several
regulations.
the
statutes
are
as
follows.
one,
the
mail
must
go
out
the
next
outgoing
shipment,
and
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i
wish
you
did,
sir.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
it
would
be
nice
if
it
were,
but
on
this
particular
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
there
is
nothing
for
damages.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
that's
true,
but
there
i
submit
to
you,
sir,
that
this
is
an
unintentional
holding
up.
if
you
knew
that
your
mail
were
intentionally
being
delayed
and
such
would
be
the
outcome
of
this
case
whereas
the
court
of
appeals
overturned,
then
your
mail,
my
mail
and
every
man's
mail
may
be
detained
for
a
total
of
29
hours
at
least
until
they
investigate
to
see
shall
we
send
it
on
or
shall
we
not.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i'll
take
your
word
for
it,
sir.
i
see
an
inspector
there
that
bothers
me
though.
it
troubles
me
deeply
to
know
that
in
this
day
of
communications
where
we're
constantly
supplying
the
police
with
more
inaccurate
means
of
obtaining
information
that
we
turn
around
and
give
them
the
same
leeway
that
they
perhaps
had
a
century
ago
when
it
isn't
necessary,
but
no
longer
is
necessary
nor
is
it
accountable.
now,
they
could've
gotten
a
warrant
and
searched
the
packages
at
the
other
end.
certainly,
they
could.
now
after
all,
if
the
mail
is
delayed
en
route
without
a
purposeful
detention,
it
would
in
our
knowledge
take
them
two
or
three
days
to
get
back
east,
or
to
california
for
that
matter.
they
know
the
addressee.
certainly,
they
had
time
to
pick
up
these
packages
at
that
time.
why
didn't
they
do
so?
doesn't
this
open
up
the
possibility
of
forum
shopping
for
a
magistrate
who
will
issue
a
search
warrant?
are
we
going
to
allow
this?
i
would
submit
that
it
is
not
allowable.
now,
one
issue
that
was
brought
up
by
the
solicitor
general,
he
said
that
it's
not
being
pressed
as
hearsay.
i
am
pressing
hearsay
to
the
fullest
extent
possible.
this
affidavit,
a
careful
analysis
shows
it
is
based
hearsay
on
hearsay.
it
violates
every
rule
laid
down
in
this
court
in
ventresca
and
in
jones
as
analyzed
by
justice
douglas.
it
doesn't
meet
these
requirements,
but
i
must
assume
arguendo
that
it
does
meet
them,
and
then
we
get
to
the
detention.
now,
another
thing
was
the
suspicion
that
these
coins
came
across
from
canada.
well,
if
they
came
from
within
the
united
states,
we
wouldn't
be
here
because
there
is
no
law
that
says
you
cannot
have
coins,
gold
coins
as
collector's
item
in
the
united
states.
in
fact,
since
this
case
first
came
about,
our
laws
have
grown
greatly
less
strict
as
to
the
handling
and
having
of
gold
coins.
now,
we
do
not
contend
that
the
search
was
without
a
warrant
--
without
a
warrant
is
valid.
this
is
true
that
the
government
does
not
contend
this,
but
yet,
what
do
we
have?
we
have
essentially
a
seizure
without
a
warrant.
a
seizure
not
for
the
few
hours
which
the
government
says
is
necessary
to
obtain
a
search
warrant,
but
a
seizure
for
many
hours
after
we
have
these
facts.
now,
is
this
plausible?
is
it
reasonable?
can
reasonable
men
even
differ
on
this
point?
but
now,
we
have
one
further
argument,
and
that
is
where
the
goods
are
already
in
the
custody
of
the
united
states,
is
it
okay
to
preserve
the
status
quo
while
the
warrant
is
being
obtained,
and
i
would
ask
you
why?
why
is
such
an
argument?
why
is
it
reasonable?
these
packages
are
placed
with
the
united
states
post
office
in
a
form
of
trust.
our
mail
system,
our
whole
system
of
communications
in
the
united
states
would
break
down
without
that
trust,
and
i
submit
that
there's
been
a
violation
of
statutory
law
laid
down
by
the
congress
and
of
cong
–-
or
of
regulations
put
down
by
the
postmaster
general.
and
i
know
that
i,
as
a
taxpayer,
if
i
violate
a
title
of
the
taxes
or
any
of
the
regulations,
i
stand
a
chance
to
be
here
on
the
regulations,
but
on
the
title,
it's
questionable.
i
will
normally
be
knocked
down
and
yet
here
we
are
saying
in
effect,
you,
the
government,
can
do
this
and
your
hands
will
not
be
slapped.
but
when
a
private
individual
do
so,
that
he
will
have
a
$5,000.00
fine
or
five
years
in
jail
and
i
ask
you,
aren't
we
all
men
equal
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
foreigner
or
citizen?
mr.
craig
g.
davis
i
would
not
be
making
this
argument,
sir.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
the
difference
is
the
amount
of
time
in
which
it
is
done,
where
reasonable
cause
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
the
postal
re
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
this
is
correct
but
we
have
here
the
issue
raised,
we
must
detain
while
we
obtain
a
search
warrant,
and
i
submit
that
it's
already
in
the
government's
hands.
they
have
it
--
mr.
craig
g.
davis
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
craig
g.
davis
it
takes
airmail,
for
my
brief,
to
reach
this
city
–-
mr.
craig
g.
davis
…approximately
three
days,
and
these
were
sent
airmail.
so
i
would
imagine
three
days
to
reach
mobile,
alabama.
mr.
craig
g.
davis
that's
correct,
but
the
question
is
do
we
begin
at
the
beginning
or
at
the
end,
and
i
submit
that
the
government
began
in
the
wrong
fashion
in
this
case.
that's
the
whole
problem.
i
don't
fault
the
government
for
the
work
done.
i
fault
them
for
the
way
in
which
they
did
it.
this
man
is
guilty.
justice
was
done;
he
did
a
year
in
prison.
he's
on
parole
now.
i
have
no
qualms
about
his
having
been
in.
i
know
he
was
guilty.
he's
admitted
it,
but
i
submit
that
the
law
now
must
be
kept
straightened
out
as
the
court
of
appeals
has
so
found.
thank
you.
