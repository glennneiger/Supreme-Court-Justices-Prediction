brennan,

but
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
gather
the
justification
in
terry
that
was
emphasized
was
the
safety
of
the
officer,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
have
anything
comparable
to
that
in
this
situation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i'm
getting
at
is
i
wonder
if
the
result
reached
in
terry
would
have
been
reached
if
that
factor
of
the
safety
of
the
officer
was
not
involved?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
davis?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
certainly,
the
officer
who
got
this
good
job
of
getting
this
information
altogether
in
an
hour
and
five
minutes.
are
you
conceding
that
at
that
point,
there
was
probable
cause
to
get
the
warrant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
what
about
your
argument
that
this
affidavit
or
this
warrant
is
not
supported
by
probable
cause?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
attack
is
on
the
form
of
the
affidavit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
