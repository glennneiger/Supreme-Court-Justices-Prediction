chief

warren
e.
burger
in
florida,
what's
the
source
of
the
right
to
sue
within
a
death
and
wrongful
act?
chief

warren
e.
burger
it's
a
statute.
chief

thank
you
mr.

mr.

chief

e.

mr.
claiborne,
had
the
suit
been
as
you
suggested
for
an
injury
not
for
death,
what
have
been
the
source
of
the
basis
for
the
suit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
were
there
no
statutes
at
all,
would
there
had
been
a
right
to
sue,
the
injury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
--
is
that
a
distinction?
i
am
not
suggesting
that
it's
a
significant,
but
that
is
a
distinction
between
the
death
act
and
the
action
for
injuries.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
law
is
different
from
what
it
is
today,
then
your
rights
would
be
in
the
courts
what
you're
really
signing
of,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
it,
that
would
just
get
us
very
far.
chief

warren
e.
burger
did
congress
have
altered
that
situation,
since
harrisburg
was
decided?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
it
makes
no
sense,
you're
saying
that
the
line
drawn
by
congress
did
not
have
a
logical,
sensible
basis,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
sure
i
followed
you
there
mr.
claiborne,
what
did
they
do
when

carved
that
out?
chief
