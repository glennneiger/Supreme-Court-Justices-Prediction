mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
ship
owner,
states
marine
line
asks
the
court
not
to
capsize
the
law,
which
has
been
in
effect
for
80
years
and
more
and
not
to
reverse
decisions,
which
have
been
made
in
this
court
as
recently
as
1964.
and
suggest
that
what
we
really
are
concerned
within
the
case
is
the
balancing
of
competing
interests
within
a
limited
geographical
area
that
is
within
the
territorial
limits
of
a
state.
and
the
question
has
got
to
be
in
the
end,
which
of
the
two
interests,
federal
or
state,
has
the
more
urgent
or
the
more
important
right
to
control
this
sort
of
death.
the
law
today
we
think
is
clear
on
principles
that
have
been
with
us
since
the
harrisburg
and
right
on
up
through
the
gillespie
in
1964
on
the
federal
side,
principles
that
have
been
known
and
used
in
florida
in
this
specific
context,
since
1953
and
as
recently
as
1968
in
this
very
case,
and
in
which
congress
and
the
florida
legislature
have
acquiesced
regularly.
we
think
that
to
overturn
a
body
of
law
that
has
been
developed
in
this
way
and
to
say
that
the
justices
of
this
court
who
have
fashioned
this
body
of
law
and
the
congress,
and
the
legislature
who
have
also
contributed
to
it
did
this
unthinkingly
or
without
realizing
what
they
were
doing
is
just
to
ask
too
much
of
you.
the
result
limited
to
the
area,
in
which
this
action
occurred
is
that
a
non
seaman,
like
moragne,
the
result
of
the
florida
supreme
court's
construction
of
the
florida
statute
is
that
moragne,
the
longshoreman
has
exactly
the
same
right
that
a
seaman
or
the
seaman
would
have
--
had
a
seaman
been
standing
right
by
him
and
been
hit
by
the
same
hatch
beam.
that
is
uniformity,
no
matter
which
way
you
turn
in
this
case
and
this
area
there's
going
to
be
assumed
non
uniformity
for
somebody.
and
the
survivors
of
mr.
moragne
here
have
already,
as
it
has
been
mentioned,
they
have
a
compensation
remedy,
and
they
have
a
negligence
remedy.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
distinction
between
the
negligence
remedy,
under
florida
law,
and
under
the
jones
act
is
really
more
apparent
than
real.
the
way
it
always
comes
up
at
the
jury
charge
stage,
you
get
practically
the
same
charge
on
burden
of
proof
and
i'll
leave
that
point
with
that.
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
that
is
of
course
true,
and
that's
the
main
reason,
i
will
submit
that
they
didn't
sue
in
admiralty
is
because
they
want
a
jury
to
weigh
this,
because
they
know
that
juries
are
better
for
plaintiffs
ordinarily.
the
man's
survivors
here
will
have,
besides
the
comp
remedy,
they
will
have
the
same
right
of
action
that
a
man
would
--
that
the
survivors
of
a
man
who
were
killed
on
the
dock,
suppose
this
man
had
been
walking,
gone
down
the
gang
way
to
get
a
swing.
third
party
trip
driver
comes
up
to
get
some
cargo,
knocks
him
down,
kills
him.
you
got
the
same
rights
as
the
man
who
works
in
a
mine
or
lives
right
next
door
to
him.
we
submit
that
this
sort
of
uniformity
is
just
as
important
and
is
just
as
appropriately
left
to
the
states,
as
it
has
been
by
congress,
and
by
this
court
up
until
now.
as
the
uniformity
that's
contended
for
by
mr.
hardee.
uniformity
has
often
been
urged
in
this
area,
on
this
court,
but
it
has
never
until
the
day
so
far
as
i
can
understand,
been
considered
to
be
a
thing
that's
required
in
the
wrongful
death
area.
even
with
jensen,
they
start
out
in
jensen
in
the
majority
opinion
and
much
emphasized
in
the
dissents,
saying
that
wrongful
death
is
an
area
that
does
not
require
the
imposition
of
uniformity
and
that
it's
ever
been
so
and
is
not
has
been
repeated,
and
repeated
to
subsequent
decisions.
the
same
sort
of
thing
can
be
said
with
respect
to
the
federal
supremacy,
which
is
argued
as
something
that's
--
somehow
cut
into
by
the
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court,
that
is
this
court
and
congress
have
deliberately
said,
no
we
will
not
assert
federal
supremacy
within
the
territorial
waters
of
the
state.
and
say,
congress
--
i'm
thinking
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
which
deliberately
leaves
to
the
state
the
right
to
regulate
recovery
for
wrongful
death
within
one
marine
league
of
the
state's
boundaries.
and
by
this
court,
in
1964,
in
gillespie,
in
which
he
said
that
the
state
act
could
not
extend
the
remedy
available
to
a
seaman.
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
yes.
and
sometimes
--
well,
yes
if
he
were
injured,
if
the
fight
cases
as
one
of
the
example,
where
the
officer
is
getting
a
scrap
in
the
bar,
something
like
this.
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
or
out
of
the
window
or
some
other
things
that
the
--
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
yes
sir,
as
a
crew
member,
employee
of
the
shipment.
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
we
think
that
the
reason
that
the
law
has
developed
in
this
way
results
from
a
consideration
of
the
desirability
of
having
local
uniformity
for
people
who
are
essentially
local,
like
longshoreman.
and
the
thought
by
the
court
in
congress
and
the
legislature
that
people
like
longshoreman,
like
this
man,
this
plaintiff's
decedent
who
live
in
tampa,
and
work
in
tampa
everyday
should
be
more
or
like
the
remedies
accorded
to
his
neighbors
and
friends
that
live
in
that
state,
then
the
need
for
uniformity
of
a
man
who
own
a
ship
comes
in
to
tampa
today,
and
he's
going
to
mobile
tomorrow,
and
panama
the
next
day
or
wherever
it
maybe.
for
people
like
that,
it
would
be
a
confusing
thing.
if
they
never
knew
from
one
week
to
the
next,
which
kind
of
law
was
going
to
control
their
rights
for
injuries,
but
this
sort
of
argument
can
apply
in
our
submission
to
a
man
who
is
a
florida
resident,
and
always
has
been.
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
sir?
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
yes
sir,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
well,
that's
true.
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
that
is
true
or
as
i
understood
the
harrisburg
decisions
is
by
the
civil
law,
even
the
common
law
and
(voice
overlap).
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
that
is
correct,
and
i
believe
in
every
state
in
the
union,
the
only
way
you
can
have
an
action
for
wrongful
death
is
by
statute.
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
comes
from
the
absence
of
legislation
your
honor.
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
i
suppose
that's
correct
sir.
as
the
florida
supreme
court
has
pointed
out,
there
seems
no
reason
in
policy,
as
far
as
florida
is
concerned
to
prefer
the
widow
of
a
longshoreman
over
the
widow
of
another
man,
because
of
the
fortuitous
of
the
circumstance
that
her
husband
met
his
death
in
the
hold
of
a
ship,
and
not
on
the
dock
or
not
in
the
mill
or
not
on
a
mine.
i
think
the
solicitor
general
and
mr.
hardee
has
said,
well
all
you
have
got
to
do
to
straighten
this
out
is
simply
to
create
a
common
law
remedy
for
maritime
purposes
anyway,
that
says
you
can
have
an
action
for
wrongful
death.
well,
the
other
way
of
saying
that
is
all
you've
got
to
do
to
straighten
this
out
is
in
effect
repeal
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
which
very
definitely
says
to
the
three-mile
limit
and
no
further
will
this
federally
created
right
come.
and
in
doing
that,
i
might
say,
speaking
of
anomalies,
you
will
be
giving
to
the
widow
of
this
longshoreman,
a
right
that
the
widow
of
a
seaman
does
not
have
under
gillespie,
which
i
think
is
the
most
recent
pronouncement
in
this
general
area.
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
what
really
is
asked
for
here,
and
this
is
worth
thinking
of
too
we
think,
is
the
fact
that
they
want
a
fault
free
remedy
for
mrs.
moragne.
this
is
not
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
ship
owner
or
conduct
of
the
ship,
this
is
a
situational
thing.
by
definition,
a
species
of
liability
without
fault
--
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
which
is
something
the
seaman
doesn't
have
for
death
if
it
occurs
within
the
three
miles
of
land.
if
it
occurs
beyond,
he
does
have
--
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
think
that's
pretty
well
what
i
wanted
to
say.
your
honors,
if
tungus
and
harrisburg,
and
the
lindgren
case,
gillespie
and
all
of
those
are
overruled,
repealed,
reversed
or
whatever
today,
it
will
create
--
we
submit
more
problems
than
it
will
solve,
then
it
will
create
an
uncertainty
on
the
part
of
the
maritime
community
that
would
be
very
undesirable,
because
none
of
us
would
know
then.
if
gillespie
has
overruled
in
1970,
what's
going
to
happen
to
moragne
in
1972
or
something
of
that
sort.
thank
you.
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
ship
owner,
states
marine
line
asks
the
court
not
to
capsize
the
law,
which
has
been
in
effect
for
80
years
and
more
and
not
to
reverse
decisions,
which
have
been
made
in
this
court
as
recently
as
1964.
and
suggest
that
what
we
really
are
concerned
within
the
case
is
the
balancing
of
competing
interests
within
a
limited
geographical
area
that
is
within
the
territorial
limits
of
a
state.
and
the
question
has
got
to
be
in
the
end,
which
of
the
two
interests,
federal
or
state,
has
the
more
urgent
or
the
more
important
right
to
control
this
sort
of
death.
the
law
today
we
think
is
clear
on
principles
that
have
been
with
us
since
the
harrisburg
and
right
on
up
through
the
gillespie
in
1964
on
the
federal
side,
principles
that
have
been
known
and
used
in
florida
in
this
specific
context,
since
1953
and
as
recently
as
1968
in
this
very
case,
and
in
which
congress
and
the
florida
legislature
have
acquiesced
regularly.
we
think
that
to
overturn
a
body
of
law
that
has
been
developed
in
this
way
and
to
say
that
the
justices
of
this
court
who
have
fashioned
this
body
of
law
and
the
congress,
and
the
legislature
who
have
also
contributed
to
it
did
this
unthinkingly
or
without
realizing
what
they
were
doing
is
just
to
ask
too
much
of
you.
the
result
limited
to
the
area,
in
which
this
action
occurred
is
that
a
non
seaman,
like
moragne,
the
result
of
the
florida
supreme
court's
construction
of
the
florida
statute
is
that
moragne,
the
longshoreman
has
exactly
the
same
right
that
a
seaman
or
the
seaman
would
have
--
had
a
seaman
been
standing
right
by
him
and
been
hit
by
the
same
hatch
beam.
that
is
uniformity,
no
matter
which
way
you
turn
in
this
case
and
this
area
there's
going
to
be
assumed
non
uniformity
for
somebody.
and
the
survivors
of
mr.
moragne
here
have
already,
as
it
has
been
mentioned,
they
have
a
compensation
remedy,
and
they
have
a
negligence
remedy.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
distinction
between
the
negligence
remedy,
under
florida
law,
and
under
the
jones
act
is
really
more
apparent
than
real.
the
way
it
always
comes
up
at
the
jury
charge
stage,
you
get
practically
the
same
charge
on
burden
of
proof
and
i'll
leave
that
point
with
that.
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
that
is
of
course
true,
and
that's
the
main
reason,
i
will
submit
that
they
didn't
sue
in
admiralty
is
because
they
want
a
jury
to
weigh
this,
because
they
know
that
juries
are
better
for
plaintiffs
ordinarily.
the
man's
survivors
here
will
have,
besides
the
comp
remedy,
they
will
have
the
same
right
of
action
that
a
man
would
--
that
the
survivors
of
a
man
who
were
killed
on
the
dock,
suppose
this
man
had
been
walking,
gone
down
the
gang
way
to
get
a
swing.
third
party
trip
driver
comes
up
to
get
some
cargo,
knocks
him
down,
kills
him.
you
got
the
same
rights
as
the
man
who
works
in
a
mine
or
lives
right
next
door
to
him.
we
submit
that
this
sort
of
uniformity
is
just
as
important
and
is
just
as
appropriately
left
to
the
states,
as
it
has
been
by
congress,
and
by
this
court
up
until
now.
as
the
uniformity
that's
contended
for
by
mr.
hardee.
uniformity
has
often
been
urged
in
this
area,
on
this
court,
but
it
has
never
until
the
day
so
far
as
i
can
understand,
been
considered
to
be
a
thing
that's
required
in
the
wrongful
death
area.
even
with
jensen,
they
start
out
in
jensen
in
the
majority
opinion
and
much
emphasized
in
the
dissents,
saying
that
wrongful
death
is
an
area
that
does
not
require
the
imposition
of
uniformity
and
that
it's
ever
been
so
and
is
not
has
been
repeated,
and
repeated
to
subsequent
decisions.
the
same
sort
of
thing
can
be
said
with
respect
to
the
federal
supremacy,
which
is
argued
as
something
that's
--
somehow
cut
into
by
the
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court,
that
is
this
court
and
congress
have
deliberately
said,
no
we
will
not
assert
federal
supremacy
within
the
territorial
waters
of
the
state.
and
say,
congress
--
i'm
thinking
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
which
deliberately
leaves
to
the
state
the
right
to
regulate
recovery
for
wrongful
death
within
one
marine
league
of
the
state's
boundaries.
and
by
this
court,
in
1964,
in
gillespie,
in
which
he
said
that
the
state
act
could
not
extend
the
remedy
available
to
a
seaman.
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
yes.
and
sometimes
--
well,
yes
if
he
were
injured,
if
the
fight
cases
as
one
of
the
example,
where
the
officer
is
getting
a
scrap
in
the
bar,
something
like
this.
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
or
out
of
the
window
or
some
other
things
that
the
--
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
yes
sir,
as
a
crew
member,
employee
of
the
shipment.
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
we
think
that
the
reason
that
the
law
has
developed
in
this
way
results
from
a
consideration
of
the
desirability
of
having
local
uniformity
for
people
who
are
essentially
local,
like
longshoreman.
and
the
thought
by
the
court
in
congress
and
the
legislature
that
people
like
longshoreman,
like
this
man,
this
plaintiff's
decedent
who
live
in
tampa,
and
work
in
tampa
everyday
should
be
more
or
like
the
remedies
accorded
to
his
neighbors
and
friends
that
live
in
that
state,
then
the
need
for
uniformity
of
a
man
who
own
a
ship
comes
in
to
tampa
today,
and
he's
going
to
mobile
tomorrow,
and
panama
the
next
day
or
wherever
it
maybe.
for
people
like
that,
it
would
be
a
confusing
thing.
if
they
never
knew
from
one
week
to
the
next,
which
kind
of
law
was
going
to
control
their
rights
for
injuries,
but
this
sort
of
argument
can
apply
in
our
submission
to
a
man
who
is
a
florida
resident,
and
always
has
been.
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
sir?
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
yes
sir,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
well,
that's
true.
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
that
is
true
or
as
i
understood
the
harrisburg
decisions
is
by
the
civil
law,
even
the
common
law
and
(voice
overlap).
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
that
is
correct,
and
i
believe
in
every
state
in
the
union,
the
only
way
you
can
have
an
action
for
wrongful
death
is
by
statute.
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
comes
from
the
absence
of
legislation
your
honor.
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
i
suppose
that's
correct
sir.
as
the
florida
supreme
court
has
pointed
out,
there
seems
no
reason
in
policy,
as
far
as
florida
is
concerned
to
prefer
the
widow
of
a
longshoreman
over
the
widow
of
another
man,
because
of
the
fortuitous
of
the
circumstance
that
her
husband
met
his
death
in
the
hold
of
a
ship,
and
not
on
the
dock
or
not
in
the
mill
or
not
on
a
mine.
i
think
the
solicitor
general
and
mr.
hardee
has
said,
well
all
you
have
got
to
do
to
straighten
this
out
is
simply
to
create
a
common
law
remedy
for
maritime
purposes
anyway,
that
says
you
can
have
an
action
for
wrongful
death.
well,
the
other
way
of
saying
that
is
all
you've
got
to
do
to
straighten
this
out
is
in
effect
repeal
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
which
very
definitely
says
to
the
three-mile
limit
and
no
further
will
this
federally
created
right
come.
and
in
doing
that,
i
might
say,
speaking
of
anomalies,
you
will
be
giving
to
the
widow
of
this
longshoreman,
a
right
that
the
widow
of
a
seaman
does
not
have
under
gillespie,
which
i
think
is
the
most
recent
pronouncement
in
this
general
area.
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
what
really
is
asked
for
here,
and
this
is
worth
thinking
of
too
we
think,
is
the
fact
that
they
want
a
fault
free
remedy
for
mrs.
moragne.
this
is
not
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
ship
owner
or
conduct
of
the
ship,
this
is
a
situational
thing.
by
definition,
a
species
of
liability
without
fault
--
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
which
is
something
the
seaman
doesn't
have
for
death
if
it
occurs
within
the
three
miles
of
land.
if
it
occurs
beyond,
he
does
have
--
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
mr.
dewey
r.
villareal,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
think
that's
pretty
well
what
i
wanted
to
say.
your
honors,
if
tungus
and
harrisburg,
and
the
lindgren
case,
gillespie
and
all
of
those
are
overruled,
repealed,
reversed
or
whatever
today,
it
will
create
--
we
submit
more
problems
than
it
will
solve,
then
it
will
create
an
uncertainty
on
the
part
of
the
maritime
community
that
would
be
very
undesirable,
because
none
of
us
would
know
then.
if
gillespie
has
overruled
in
1970,
what's
going
to
happen
to
moragne
in
1972
or
something
of
that
sort.
thank
you.
