mr.
david
c.g.
kerr
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
representing
the
respondent
stevedore,
gulf
florida
terminal
corporation
that
was
impleaded
by
the
ship
owner,
by
virtue
of
the
ryan
doctrine,
which
has
been
referred
by
mr.
hardee.
and
before
proceeding
with
the
two
or
three
points
that
i'd
like
to
cover,
i
might
mention
parenthetically
that
mr.
hardee
indicated
the
ryan
doctrine
was
one
newly
fashioned
in
admiralty.
and
if
i
remember
that
decision
correctly,
and
it's
not
correctly
involved
in
the
appeal
here.
it
was
merely
an
extension
of
implied
contractual
warranties,
which
had
been
recognized
as
early
as
buick
versus
pearson
and
then
restated
in
the
restatement
contracts.
and
those
with
authorities
were
lined
on
by
the
court.
in
any
event,
at
this
stage
of
litigation,
at
least.
the
interest
of
the
ship
owner
and
the
stevedore
are
alive.
and
we
join
therefore,
in
urging
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
insofar
as
they
incorporated
the
opinion,
the
florida
supreme
court,
that
court
also
be
affirmed
by
this
court.
i'd
like
to
make
just
three
points.
the
first
one
is
one
that
was
i
think
had
demonstrated
by
the
florida
supreme
court
in
its
opinion,
as
one
of
the
factors,
practical
factors
that
it
had
in
mind
in
trying
to
arrive
at
a
decision.
and
that
was
the
posture
of
the
case
as
it
presented
itself
to
that
point,
in
the
first
place.
the
court
recognized
that
mrs.
moragne,
the
petitioner
here,
had
available
one
remedy
irrespective
of
fault
already.
they
took
note
of
the
fact,
that
she
had
available
two
of
the
statutory
remedies,
under
the
federal
longshoremen's
and
harbor
worker's
compensation
act.
they
also
recognized
that
she
would
have
an
addition
to
that
light.
the
right
to
pursue
a
course
of
action
based
on
negligence
on
the
florida
wrongful
death
statute.
so
that
the
sole
issue
really,
the
sole
practical
issue
was
whether
or
not
she
could
also,
in
addition
to
those
two
pursue
a
cause
of
action
based
on
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness,
which
stated
somewhat
differently,
and
is
already
alluded
to
by
mr.
villareal,
simply
boils
down
to
the
fact
as
to
what
burden
of
proof
she
will
have
to
maintain
in
the
trial
court.
at
this
stage
then,
the
off
repeated
cry,
which
is
found
in
the
briefs
of
the
petitioner
and
some
of
the
amicus
briefs
also.
to
the
effect
that
it
is
cheaper
to
kill
than
to
injure
is
at
least
premature,
indeed
should
negligence
be
established
under
the
florida
wrongful
death
statute,
it
could
very
possibly
be
that
she
would
receive
as
much
in
compensation,
if
not
more
than
some
other
defendants,
similarly
situated
to
a
land
based
or
lands
locked.
the
second
point,
which
i
think
was
paramount
in
the
mind
of
the
fifth
circuit,
when
they
considered
this
problem,
was
that
in
tungus,
the
decision,
the
majority
opinions
is
quite
clear
and
was
followed
by
the
parties
all
the
way
up
to
the
fifth
circuit,
and
was
followed
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
adapting
the
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court.
because
in
tungus,
there
are
at
least
four
points,
which
become
eminently
clear
and
which
is
stated
without
any
equivocation
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
first
is
that
the
state
wrongful
death
statutes
do
not
merely
give
rise
to
a
right
to
recover,
but
further
establish
what
type
of
conduct
is
actionable.
the
second
proposition,
which
is
stated
with
equal
clarity
is
that
when
admiralty
courts
are
called
upon
to
apply
or
enforce
rights,
which
are
"routed"
in
state
law,
then
they
the
admiralty
courts
must
do
so
consonant
with
state
substantive
law,
they
may
not,
as
the
decision
went
on
to
say
pick
or
choose.
the
third
principle,
which
is
eminently
clear
in
that
opinion,
is
that
congress
in
enacting
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
intended
to
preserve
intact
state
sovereignty
over
maritime
deaths
within
territorial
waters.
and
the
fourth
proposition,
which
is
stated
in
the
opinion,
is
that
the
uniformity
argument,
is
in
opposite
in
rights
--
in
the
case
of
rights
given
to
recover
in
death
cases.
and
as
already
been
suggested
this
was
noted
as
early
as
the
jensen
case,
both
in
the
majority
opinion
and
in
mr.
justice
holmes'
opinion
where
he
spoke
of
the
specter
of
a
lack
of
uniformity
in
referring
to
this
particular
area
of
the
law.
this
latter
proposition
in
tungus,
we
submit
is
probably
or
undoubtedly
the
key
question
that
is,
why
is
it
that
in
this
particular
area
of
the
law,
with
respect
to
the
death
cases,
there
should
be
a
departure
from
so-called
uniformity
and
there
has
been
consistently
in
this
court
and
other
courts.
we
submit
that
the
harrisburg,
and
jensen,
and
tungus,
and
also
in
particularly
actually
language
of
mr.
justice
harlan's
dissent
in
hess
suggest
several
reasons
why
in
this
particular
area
of
the
law,
uniformity
has
not
been
a
compelling
factor.
in
the
first
place,
actions
for
wrongful
death
being
preaches
of
statute
or
inherently
non-uniform,
in
every
jurisdiction.
and
it's
not
very
helpful
here
to
point
out
that
the
archade
in
inhumane
treatment,
given
this
matter
on
the
common
law
is
no
longer
fashionable.
this
of
course
is
true
but
the
simple
fact
is
that
every
jurisdiction
has
its
own
statutory
scheme.
indeed,
congress
has
two
separate
statutory
schemes,
and
they
are
themselves
dissimilar.
so,
perhaps
uniformity
or
lack
of
uniformity
for
this
reason
is
a
built
in
situation.
secondly,
as
it
has
been
pointed
out,
the
wrongful
death
statutes
involved
matters
which
are
peculiarly
of
local
concern,
and
in
again
from
the
hess
opinion,
site
such
examples
as
pauperism
and
dissent
and
distribution,
in
other
matters
which
are
really
almost
within
the
state's
police
power.
the
third
reason,
why
this
area
has
perhaps
been
carved
out
of
the
uniformity
situation,
while
the
wrongful
death
statute
maybe
of
grave
concern
in
individual
cases
to
certain
individuals,
they
do
not
from
a
maritime
concept
involve
matters
of
navigation
and
commerce.
in
reading
the
cases,
one
notices,
particularly
in
hess
and
also
in
jensen,
that
the
concept
of
uniformity
in
admiralty
was
developed
more
as
a
maritime
commercial
aid,
that
is
to
give
the
ship
owner
some
degree
of
certainty,
as
to
what
his
obligations
would
be
commercial
and
from
the
standpoint
of
commercial
obligations,
and
navigational
requirements
and
regulations,
from
state
to
state
and
nation
to
nation.
it
was
to
give
him
some
certainty.
indeed,
i
think
this
is
perhaps
an
explanation
of
the
hess
case,
where
the
oregon
statute
in
question,
increased
or
imposed
an
added
burden.
it
was
this
type
of
uniformity
from
the
standpoint
of
the
ship
owner's
operation
that
the
concept
we
suggest
or
we
submit
was
evolved
to
meet.
mr.
david
c.g.
kerr
yes
sir,
i
have.
mr.
david
c.g.
kerr
i
believe
it's
filed
in
my
partner's
name,
i
was
not
admitted
at
the
time.
i
was
admitted
yesterday.
mr.
david
c.g.
kerr
it's
the
brief
on
behalf
of
gulf
florida
terminal
company
respondent.
and
there's
a
name
of
george
w.
ericksen
and
james
b.
mcdonough
jr.
finally,
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
wrongful
death
statutes
are
not
efforts
to
delineate
or
create
standards
of
conduct
or
care
but
rather
designed
merely
to
give
a
remedy,
where
an
existing
standard
is
breached
and
since
this
is
resulting
in
death
of
course.
the
final
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
in
this
connection
is
that
the
statutory
history
of
the
florida
wrongful
death
statute
was
of
some
concern
to
the
florida
court.
it
was
discussed
in
some
length
in
the
opinion
and
this
is
consonant
with
the
attitude,
which
has
been
demonstrated
by
this
court
and
its
concern
with
the
history
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
and
the
jones
act.
we
note
for
instance
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
was
passed
34
years
after
the
harrisburg
had
established
that
there
was
no
action
for
wrongful
death
in
maritime
law
or
fatality
within
the
territorial
waters
of
the
state
and
demonstrated
as
it
has
been
noted
by
this
court,
an
intent
to
preserve
state
sovereignty
in
this
area.
there
have
been
no
amendments
to
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
until
the
recently
proposed
magnuson
(ph)
bill,
which
is
senate
bill
3143
and
is
mentioned
in
the
briefs.
despite
the
decision
in
tungus
in
1959,
and
hess
in
1960.
similarly,
with
respect
to
the
jones
act,
there
has
been
no
amendment
to
cover
death
of
a
seaman
in
state
territorial
waters
based
on
unseaworthiness
as
a
cause
of
action.
despite
the
decision
in
lindgren,
which
was
in
1930
and
the
reaffirmation
of
that
principle
in
gillespie
in
1964,
so
this
court
has
taken
note
of
congress's
inactivity
or
of
acquiescence.
the
florida
supreme
court
was
faced
with
a
very
similar
situation,
because
in
graham
v.
lusi,
which
was
decided
in
1953,
it
was
held
that
the
florida
statute
did
not
contemplate
a
cause
of
action
based
on
unseaworthiness,
and
that
was
reaffirmed
in
emerson
v.
holloway
in
1960.
so
there
were
15
years
without
corrective
action
by
the
florida
legislature,
and
yet
as
noted
by
the
florida
supreme
court,
the
florida
legislature
has
been
sensitive
to
the
statute,
because
it
amend
the
statute
to
cover
cause
of
action
based
on
a
warranty
on
food
stuffs,
etcetera.
and
they
did
that
very
promptly,
because
a
decision
which
held
that
was
not
covered
under
statute,
it
was
1952
in
the
very
next
session
adopted
an
amendment,
the
florida
wrongful
death
statute,
but
they
have
not
chosen
to
do
so,
despite
the
opinions
of
the
fifth
circuit,
which
have
been
in
existence
for
some
time.
we
attach
some
significance
to
the
sensitivity
which
has
been
demonstrated
by
this
court,
as
well
as
the
sensitivities
demonstrated
by
florida
supreme
court
to
existing
statute
and
existing
statutory
schemes.
we
feel
in
highlights
of
the
fact
that
if
a
change,
in
this
particular
area
of
the
laws
to
come,
it
must
come
to
the
legislature,
and
not
to
the
court.
mr.
david
c.g.
kerr
no
sir,
i
don't
believe
it
does.
mr.
david
c.g.
kerr
yes
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
was
merely
emphasizing
the
florida
supreme
court
was
also
sensitive
to
a
statutory
history
which
it
had
and
this
court
has
demonstrated,
i
believe
that
same
sensitivity
in
these
decisions.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
david
c.g.
kerr
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
representing
the
respondent
stevedore,
gulf
florida

uniformity
has
not
been
a
compelling
factor.
in
the
first
place,
actions
for
wrongful
death
being
preaches
of
statute
or
inherently
non-uniform,
in
every
jurisdiction.
and
it's
not
very
helpful
here
to
point
out
that
the
archade
in
inhumane
treatment,
given
this
matter
on
the
common
law
is
no
longer
fashionable.
this
of
course
is
true
but
the
simple
fact
is
that
every
jurisdiction
has
its
own
statutory
scheme.
indeed,
congress
has
two
separate
statutory
schemes,
and
they
are
themselves
dissimilar.
so,
perhaps
uniformity
or
lack
of
uniformity
for
this
reason
is
a
built
in
situation.
secondly,
as
it
has
been
pointed
out,
the
wrongful
death
statutes
involved
matters
which
are
peculiarly
of
local
concern,
and
in
again
from
the
hess
opinion,
site
such
examples
as
pauperism
and
dissent
and
distribution,
in
other
matters
which
are
really
almost
within
the
state's
police
power.
the
third
reason,
why
this
area
has
perhaps
been
carved
out
of
the
uniformity
situation,
while
the
wrongful
death
statute
maybe
of
grave
concern
in
individual
cases
to
certain
individuals,
they
do
not
from
a
maritime
concept
involve
matters
of
navigation
and
commerce.
in
reading
the
cases,
one
notices,
particularly
in
hess
and
also
in
jensen,
that
the
concept
of
uniformity
in
admiralty
was
developed
more
as
a
maritime
commercial
aid,
that
is
to
give
the
ship
owner
some
degree
of
certainty,
as
to
what
his
obligations
would
be
commercial
and
from
the
standpoint
of
commercial
obligations,
and
navigational
requirements
and
regulations,
from
state
to
state
and
nation
to
nation.
it
was
to
give
him
some
certainty.
indeed,
i
think
this
is
perhaps
an
explanation
of
the
hess
case,
where
the
oregon
statute
in
question,
increased
or
imposed
an
added
burden.
it
was
this
type
of
uniformity
from
the
standpoint
of
the
ship
owner's
operation
that
the
concept
we
suggest
or
we
submit
was
evolved
to
meet.
mr.
david
c.g.
kerr
yes
sir,
i
have.
mr.
david
c.g.
kerr
i
believe
it's
filed
in
my
partner's
name,
i
was
not
admitted
at
the
time.
i
was
admitted
yesterday.
mr.
david
c.g.
kerr
it's
the
brief
on
behalf
of
gulf
florida
terminal
company
respondent.
and
there's
a
name
of
george
w.
ericksen
and
james
b.
mcdonough
jr.
finally,
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
wrongful
death
statutes
are
not
efforts
to
delineate
or
create
standards
of
conduct
or
care
but
rather
designed
merely
to
give
a
remedy,
where
an
existing
standard
is
breached
and
since
this
is
resulting
in
death
of
course.
the
final
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
in
this
connection
is
that
the
statutory
history
of
the
florida
wrongful
death
statute
was
of
some
concern
to
the
florida
court.
it
was
discussed
in
some
length
in
the
opinion
and
this
is
consonant
with
the
attitude,
which
has
been
demonstrated
by
this
court
and
its
concern
with
the
history
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
and
the
jones
act.
we
note
for
instance
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
was
passed
34
years
after
the
harrisburg
had
established
that
there
was
no
action
for
wrongful
death
in
maritime
law
or
fatality
within
the
territorial
waters
of
the
state
and
demonstrated
as
it
has
been
noted
by
this
court,
an
intent
to
preserve
state
sovereignty
in
this
area.
there
have
been
no
amendments
to
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
until
the
recently
proposed
magnuson
(ph)
bill,
which
is
senate
bill
3143
and
is
mentioned
in
the
briefs.
despite
the
decision
in
tungus
in
1959,
and
hess
in
1960.
similarly,
with
respect
to
the
jones
act,
there
has
been
no
amendment
to
cover
death
of
a
seaman
in
state
territorial
waters
based
on
unseaworthiness
as
a
cause
of
action.
despite
the
decision
in
lindgren,
which
was
in
1930
and
the
reaffirmation
of
that
principle
in
gillespie
in
1964,
so
this
court
has
taken
note
of
congress's
inactivity
or
of
acquiescence.
the
florida
supreme
court
was
faced
with
a
very
similar
situation,
because
in
graham
v.
lusi,
which
was
decided
in
1953,
it
was
held
that
the
florida
statute
did
not
contemplate
a
cause
of
action
based
on
unseaworthiness,
and
that
was
reaffirmed
in
emerson
v.
holloway
in
1960.
so
there
were
15
years
without
corrective
action
by
the
florida
legislature,
and
yet
as
noted
by
the
florida
supreme
court,
the
florida
legislature
has
been
sensitive
to
the
statute,
because
it
amend
the
statute
to
cover
cause
of
action
based
on
a
warranty
on
food
stuffs,
etcetera.
and
they
did
that
very
promptly,
because
a
decision
which
held
that
was
not
covered
under
statute,
it
was
1952
in
the
very
next
session
adopted
an
amendment,
the
florida
wrongful
death
statute,
but
they
have
not
chosen
to
do
so,
despite
the
opinions
of
the
fifth
circuit,
which
have
been
in
existence
for
some
time.
we
attach
some
significance
to
the
sensitivity
which
has
been
demonstrated
by
this
court,
as
well
as
the
sensitivities
demonstrated
by
florida
supreme
court
to
existing
statute
and
existing
statutory
schemes.
we
feel
in
highlights
of
the
fact
that
if
a
change,
in
this
particular
area
of
the
laws
to
come,
it
must
come
to
the
legislature,
and
not
to
the
court.
mr.
david
c.g.
kerr
no
sir,
i
don't
believe
it
does.
mr.
david
c.g.
kerr
yes
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
was
merely
emphasizing
the
florida
supreme
court
was
also
sensitive
to
a
statutory
history
which
it
had
and
this
court
has
demonstrated,
i
believe
that
same
sensitivity
in
these
decisions.
thank
you
very
much.
