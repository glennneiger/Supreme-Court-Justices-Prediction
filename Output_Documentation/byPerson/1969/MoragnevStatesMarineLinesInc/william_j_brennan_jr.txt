justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
--
and
you
could
have
sued,
i
gather
mr.
hardee
in
the
case
of
an
injury
not
a
death.
you
had
your
option
to
proceed
in
the
federal
court
or
in
the
state
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
either
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
a
death
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
controlling
law
that
would
have
to
be
applied
would
be
the
federal
maritime
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
i
gather
you
take
the
same
position
in
death
cases.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
insist
that
harrisburg
should
be
overruled.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
--
a
different
federal
maritime
rule
applied.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
listen
to
another
answer
here
anyway.
this
whole
thing
arises
because
count
2,
which
is
framed
on
unseaworthiness
was
dismissed
by
the
district
court
and
that
dismissal
was
sustained
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
that
all
was
founded
on
unseaworthiness,
wouldn't
it?
a
federal
question
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
exactly.
count
2
doesn't
uniquely
invoke
the
state
wrongful
death.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
they
bring
something
like
in
--
what
was
it
mcallister
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
you
would
have
a
--
would
you
have
comparative
negligence
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
what
it
is
in
the
non
death
case,
would
have
--
in
a
seaworthiness
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
those
--
you
would
simply
apply
under
death
cases,
the
substantive
rules
are
now
applicable
in
non
death
cases,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
had
only
the
jones
act
within
the
three
miles.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
outside
he
has
on
option
of
death
on
the
high
seas
act
or
jones
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
the
language
in
the
death
on
high
seas
act
is
a
usually
local
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
who
can
neglect
or
default
–
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
broad
enough
to
cover
both
negligence
and
unseaworthiness.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
the
straight
negligence
to
that
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
has
never
been
squarely
raised
whether
outside
of
the
three-mile?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
the
seaman
the
--
whether
it's
exclusive
under
the
jones
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
rather
has
this
court
ever
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
jones
act
says
its
seaman.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
aren't
the
beneficiaries
different
under
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

in
any
event,
that
issue
is
not

us
in
