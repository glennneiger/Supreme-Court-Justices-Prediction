justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it,
you
brought
your
original
action,
the
state
court.
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
state's
wrongful
death
act
and
under
the
state
survivor
act.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
it
was
removed
by
the
defendant
to
the
federal
court
solely
on
the
basis
of
diversity
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
view
of
that,
i
have
a
little
trouble
seeing
what
the
tungus
or
the
harrisburg
or
anything
else,
any
of
the
those
cases
have,
what
bearing
they
have
on
this
case,
if
this
is
a
state
action
for
a
wrongful
death,
in
the
district
court
only
by
reason
of
diversity
and
not
by
a
reason
of
its
admirably
jurisdiction,
doesn't
erie
railroad
against
tompkins
require
that
the
district
court
follow
the
state
law,
whatever
it
may
be.
i'm
aware
of
course,
this
court
asked
you
about
the
harrisburg
and
asked
the
parties
to
brief
it
but
--
so,
if
this
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
as
it
result
any
death?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
didn't
choose
to
go
there.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
in
order
to
test
the
continuing
validity
of
the
harrisburg
it
would
seem
to
me
that
a
plaintiff
--
you
should
have
added,
another
complaint,
an
admiralty
for
wrongful
death.
you
were
simply
suing
under
the
state
wrongful
death
statute
and
the
state
survivor
statue.
justice
potter
stewart
for
negligence
and
unseaworthiness
and
the
florida
supreme
court
is
now
held
that
the
state
--
these
two
state
statutes
don't
embody
a
liability
for
unseaworthiness.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
order
to
test
the
continuing
validity,
harrisburg
it
seems
to
me
a
plaintiff
would
have
to
sue
for
wrongful
death
and
admiralty.
you've
never
gone
to
the
admiralty
side,
you
never
--
the
federal
court
in
order
to
plea
the
cause
of
action
in
admiralty
in
the
state
court.
i'm
just
telling
him
my
objection
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
tungus
and
in
harrisburg,
the
cause
of
action
was
in
admiralty.
and
the
holding
was
that
there
is
no
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death
in
admiralty,
but
that
admiralty
may
--
the
event
of
wrongful
death
may
borrow
from
the
local
state
statute.
but
here
you
sued
under
the
local
state
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
the
tungus
or
the
harrisburg
could
be
attested
by
a
plaintiff
who
sued
in
admiralty
for
wrongful
death.
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
is
removed
un-diversity
and
what
happens
to
erie
railroad
against
tompkins.
justice
potter
stewart
the
plaintiff
here
elected
to
proceed
under
two
state
statutes,
a
wrongful
death
statute
and
a
survivor
statute.
he
didn't
sue
on
admiralty,
quite
unlike
the
plaintiff
in
the
tungus
case.
justice
potter
stewart
without
question.
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
and
(voice
overlap)
jones
act.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
submission
of
this
case
would
be
that
those
people
would
have
greater
right
of
action
for
wrongful
death,
they're
representatives,
for
the
wrongful
death
of
those
people,
and
they
would
if
they
were
sure
that
they
happened
on
the
shore
or
on
the
land
in
florida,
which
gives
the
right
to
wrongful
death
only
for
negligence,
i
gather?
justice
potter
stewart
no
congress
passed
a
statute,
the
people
beyond
the
three-mile
limit.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
true
of
course
in
the
--
that's
nothing
unusual
about
that,
many
states
for
example,
that
have
limited
liability
for
wrongful
death.
justice
potter
stewart
this
isn't
a
case
where
no
remedy
is
provided.
there
is
a
remedy
here
for
negligence.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
how
can
that
be
or
how
is
that?
justice
potter
stewart
the
negligence
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
wasn't
a
seaman
in
tungus,
he
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
except
jones
act,
insofar
as
it
has
been
acquitted
with
fela.
justice
potter
stewart
still
uses
the
word
negligence.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
borrowing
from
the
federal
law
that
actually
covers
this
decedent,
i.e.
the
federal
longshoreman's
and
harbor
workers
act?
so
far
the
beneficiaries
go?
justice
potter
stewart
passengers
wouldn't
be
covered
by
seaworthiness.
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
unseaworthiness
would
they?
justice
potter
stewart
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
potter
stewart
except
by
--
that's
changed
by
--
by
congressional
action,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
is
a
federal
--
justice
potter
stewart
a
passenger.
justice
potter
stewart
why,
why
it
is
state?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
this
is
an
admiralty
case,
you
wouldn't
have
a
jury,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
however
that
congress,
with
respect
to
seaman,
has
very
broadly
legislated,
depending
upon
their
status,
i
suppose
conceivably
the
jones
act
would
cover
a
seaman
injured
on
shore,
wouldn't
it?
if
he
were
a
seaman,
a
bonafide
member
of
the
crew
of
the
ship
and
went
to
shore,
that
is
(voice
overlap)
for
the
ships
galley
and
were
injured
by
agency
of
the
ship.
i
suppose
he'd
be
under
the
jones
act,
wouldn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
would
depend
entirely
on
his
status,
rather
than
the
(inaudible)
of
acts
of
the
injuries,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
because
that
would
be
the
language
of
the
jones
act.
justice
potter
stewart
the
other
way
of
putting
it
is
that
the
only
areas
where
you
have
actions
for
wrongful
death
have
had
to
come
from
the
legislators,
not
from
the
courts.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
the
common
law
or
an
admiralty,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
say,
wherever
you
have
a
wrongful
death
action,
in
the
anglo-american
legal
system,
it's
because
of
legislations,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
what
the
florida
legislature
has
done
or
has
not
done
doesn't
really
bear
at
all
upon
the
fundamental
issue
here
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
congress
has
done
or
has
not
done
indeed
it
does
a
great
--
perhaps
a
great
deal
in
relevance,
certainly
has
relevance.
justice
potter
stewart
for
passengers
primarily.
justice
potter
stewart
a
passenger
doesn't
have
a
right
to
recover
for
unseaworthiness
wherever
he
is.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
negligence,
not
unseaworthiness.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it,
you
brought
your
original
action,
the
state
court.
justice
potter
stewart

justice
potter
stewart
and
that
it
was
removed
by
the
defendant
to
the
federal
court
solely
on
the
basis
of

jurisdiction.

if
this
is

a

in
the

only
by

of

and
not
by
a

of
its

jurisdiction,
doesn't
erie

require
that

whatever
it
may

i'm
