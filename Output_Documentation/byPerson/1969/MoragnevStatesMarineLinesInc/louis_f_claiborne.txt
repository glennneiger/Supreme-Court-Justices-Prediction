mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
is
here
in
this
case,
pursuant
to
the
court's
invitation
to
file
a
brief
and
to
participate
in
the
oral
argument
of
the
case.
we
have
devoted
our
submission
primarily
to
the
proposition
that
the
harrisburg,
in
answer
to
the
court's
question
ought
to
be
overruled.
incidentally,
we
see
no
difficulty,
and
that's
being
done
in
a
diversity
case,
it
has
been
clear,
i
think
that
a
state
court
may
apply
admiralty
law
at
the
federal
court
to
which
such
and
causes
removed
under
the
diversity
of
jurisdiction
may
likewise
do
so.
although,
the
case
could
not
have
been
brought
on
the
law
side
of
the
federal
court
originally,
the
absence
of
diversity
of
system.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
thought
mr.
justice
stewart
this
court
had
long
settled
that
under
the
savings
pursued
as
clause,
state
courts,
all
federal
courts
acting
as
state
courts
that
is
under
that
diversity,
jurisdiction
applied
federal
maritime
law
in
all
maritime
cases.
at
the
election
of
the
plaintiff,
otherwise
admiralty
sought
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
may
be
a
problem
of
pleading.
there
maybe
a
problem
of
pleading.
there's
no
problem
of
jurisdiction.
the
court
here,
just
as
mr.
justice
brennan
said
a
moment
ago,
that
this
has
been
a
possible
injury
case,
the
claim
could
have
been
under
the
warranty
of
sea
worthiness,
a
federal
claim.
and
it
could
have
been
vindicated
in
the
state
court
or
in
the
federal
court
under
diversity.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
there
is
no
difference
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
except
to
the
extent
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
claim
was
unseaworthiness
as
recognized
by
the
state
wrongful
death
statute.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
however,
as
i
read
the
complaint,
the
suit
is
brought
simply
alleging
a
claim
for
wrongful
death
and
unseaworthiness
without
particularly
or
uniquely
invoking
the
state
wrongful
death
statute.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
nor
does
count
4,
which
is
also
an
unseaworthiness
count,
though
for
the
seaman's
--
longshoreman
own
injury.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
would
have
been
the
federal
maritime
law
of
unseaworthiness
as
to
count
2
of
the
complaint,
which
is
the
only
here
at
issue,
which
is
enforceable
in
both
the
state
court.
and
on
the
law
side
of
the
federal
court
under
the
diversity
head
of
jurisdiction,
as
well
as
in
admiralty
without
a
jury,
without
diversity.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
with
no
statute,
whatever,
there
would
have
been
a
right
to
sue
for
the
injury.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
as
suggested
here
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
once
the
harrisburg
is
overruled,
as
we
think
--
as
we
submit
to
the
court
it
should
be,
there
will
likewise
be
a
right
to
sue
for
wrongful
death
without
a
statute,
without
invoking
of
the
state
wrongful
death
statutes.
and
so,
in
that
sense,
this
is
exactly
the
same
case,
it
would
be
for
personal
injury
in
the
right
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
reason
of
jurisdictional
problem,
there
maybe
a
question
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
pleading,
though
i
don't
think
there's
any
problem
as
sufficiency
to
complaint.
there
maybe
some
question
as
to
the
plaintiff's
agreeing
that
the
matter
are
to
be
determined
at
the
period
of
time
by
reference
to
the
florida
law,
when
the
certification
to
the
florida
supreme
court
was
made.
however,
it
really
is
not
my
place
to
speak
to
any
defect
in
the
way
the
plaintiff
brought
the
suit
here.
we
must
assume,
that
the
question
is
before
the
court
and
answer
it
as
the
court
requested
that
we
do.
the
faults
of
--
and
the
problems
created
by
the
decision
in
the
harrisburg
have
been
sufficiently
exposed.
the
underlying
principles
of
both
the
common
law
rule,
denying
recovery
for
wrongful
death,
and
the
application
of
that
rule
to
admiralty
have
been
criticized
by
so
many
eminent
jurists
and
scholars
that
i
need
hardly
add
anything
to
what
they've
said,
mentioning
only
that
they
include
mr.
justice
holmes,
judge
learned
hand,
dean
prosser
and
dean
pound.
congress
in
one
sense,
has
also
repudiated
the
result,
which
the
harrisburg
required
by
enacting
the
federal
statutes
which
to
a
lot
extent
supplant
the
state
laws
and
notably
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
though
it
stops
three-mile
line
and
the
jones
act,
which
covers
all
maritime
waters
built
only
with
respect
to
true
seaman.
the
harrisburg
is
today
whatever
the
correctness
of
the
decision
at
the
time,
and
there's
some
reason
to
question
that
is
today
an
anachronism.
it
creates
a
series
of
anomalies,
which
are
not
mere
anomalies,
they're
arbitrary
results
often
unjust
and
very
much
it
adds
with
the
desirable
uniformity
of
the
admiralty
law.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
no
question
whatever,
mr.
chief
justice
that
congress
could
and
as
the
other
side
will
--
i'm
sure
point
out,
there
is
pending
appeal
which
would
have
some
such
result,
though
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they
did
alter
to
the
extent
of
the
high
seas,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
did
alter
it,
to
the
extent
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
jones
act
for
the
entire
coverage
of
maritime
law,
but
only
with
respect
to
seaman,
so
we
really
have
a
small
area
left,
which
congress
--
the
reasons
which
i
will
try
to
explain
in
the
moment,
did
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
within
the
three-mile
limit,
yes
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
so
putting
it
the
other
way
mr.
justice
stewart,
we've
said
they
should
not
have
less
rights
than
because
the
action
had
occurred
beyond
the
three-mile
limit
nor
they
should
have
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'll
come
to
that
mr.
justice
stewart.
let
me
say
that
the
anomalies
created
are
really
three.
the
same
conduct,
which
imposes
liability
on
ship
owners,
produces
one
result
if
the
man
--
if
the
victim
is
injured,
it
produces
often
a
different
result,
the
man
is
killed,
there
is
no
rhyme
or
reason
to
that.
likewise,
the
same
conduct
by
the
ship
owner
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
there
is
--
mr.
justice
stewart
there
is
no
state
law,
which
provides
no
remedy
when
the
man
is
killed
while
providing
remedy
for
the
same
conduct,
when
the
man
is
merely
injured.
it
maybe
degrees
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
same
conduct,
which
in
this
case,
this
purpose
is
unseaworthiness
of
the
vessel
affords
no
remedy
under
florida
law,
when
the
seaman
died,
when
the
longshoreman
died,
whereas
it
affords
a
remedy
as
it
must
under
federal
or
when
the
longshoreman
is
injured,
so
it's
an
all
or
nothing
proposition.
likewise,
the
same
conduct
may
give
rise
to
an
obligation
to
pay
and
the
right
of
recovery,
depending
on
whether
it
happens
within
or
outside
the
three-mile
limit.
a
line
which
makes
no
sense
in
terms
of
the
maritime
jurisdiction,
which
covers
the
entire
area.
and
finally
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
i
think
it
--
as
i
will
suggest
it
did
have
some
basis.
i'm
suggesting
that
the
result,
which
i
don't
think
it
was
intended
by
congress,
because
of
the
differences
in
the
law
that
existed
has
now
become
acute
and
arbitrary,
though
i
don't
impute
any
such
purpose
to
the
congress
in
1920,
when
the
remedies,
were
quite
different,
and
the
state
laws
quite
adequately
state
wrongful
death
statutes,
quite
adequately
covered
the
three-mile
area.
beyond
that
there
was
a
confused
situation,
some
form
of
vacuum,
and
at
least
in
appropriate
place
to
an
urgent
need
to
provide
a
law,
a
law
that
was
thought
comparable
to
the
state
remedy,
provided
by
the
wrongful
death
actions.
indeed,
the
suggestion
is
that
the
state
law
was
more
generous
than
the
new
federal
and
some
complaint
do
not
displace
the
state
law
within
the
three-mile
area,
to
have
now
turned
round,
seems
to
impute
a
very
strange
notion,
the
congressional
purpose.
now
strange
as
to
all
the
anomalies
produced
by
the
harrisburg,
as
construed
in
the
tungus,
is
that
true
seaman
are
often
less
able
to
recover
than
those
who
recover
for
unseaworthiness
or
other
seaman's
remedies
only
because
they
do
the
work
as
barely
performed
by
seaman,
so
called
seriaki
seaman.
so
the
question
arises
why
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
how
can
that
be?
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
because
under
this
court's
decision,
in
lindgren
and
in
gillespie,
a
seaman
who
is
killed,
its
survivors
cannot
resort
to
state
wrongful
death
act,
even
where
that
state
wrongful
death
act
would
provide
a
remedy
for
unseaworthiness,
but
as
defined
in
the
jones
act
remedy
for
negligence.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
therefore,
in
the
tungus,
that
remedy
would
not
have
been
available
to
a
seaman,
because
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
he
wasn't,
but
the
seaman
would
not
have
had
the
benefit
of
the
ruling
of
the
tungus,
given
the
fact
that
new
jersey
law
did
provide
that
remedy.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
which
does
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i'm
assuming
there's
a
difference,
and
in
this
case,
the
assumption
is
there's
a
difference
between
unseaworthiness
and
negligence,
though
i
recognize
that
negligence
under
the
jones
act
is
a
broader
concept
than
negligence
under
florida's
law.
and
it
must
be
--
there
has
to
be
a
reason
for
not
setting
things
right.
there
could
be
three
reasons,
the
first
is
that
a
long
time
has
passed
and
it's
too
late,
that
this
court
has
made
a
lot
of
decisions
premised
on
the
harrisburg,
and
that
congress
has
legislated
against
that
background.
and
it
uses
a
practical
matter
impossible
to
undue
80
years
of
legislation
in
jurisprudence.
the
remarkable
fact
is
that
that
is
not
true.
a
simple
overruling
of
the
harrisburg
would
recreate
the
uniformity,
basic
uniformity
in
the
maritime
law.
and
it
would
erase
all
the
harsh
anomalies
that
are
dispensable.
now,
in
saying
that
i
assume
that
overly
what
harrisburg
carries
with
it,
first
day
proposition
that
now,
that
federal
law,
federal
substantive
law
is
available
in
death
cases.
there
can
be
no
resort
to
state
laws,
even
more
favorable
to
state
laws.
therefore,
the
anomalies
resulted
in
hess
versus
united
states,
about
which
mr.
justice
harlan
and
others
complained
would
no
longer
obtain.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that
is
the
second
argument
against
repealing
the
harrisburg
by
judicial
action
rather
than
by
legislative
action.
there
were
statements
in
the
decision,
in
the
majority
decision
in
the
tungus
to
the
effect
that
congress
drew
a
knowing
line
between
the
three
miles
and
beyond
three
miles.
that
it
explicitly
or
clearly
intended
to
preserve
state
remedies
within
the
three-mile
area.
having
looked
at
the
legislative
history,
we
noticed
first
that
the
committee
report
say
no
such
thing
they
simply
notice
the
result
that
state
laws
will
remain
available
within
the
three-mile
area.
that
is
not
to
say
that
congress
consciously
meant
to
preserve
that
situation
forever.
the
stray
remarks
that
were
made
on
the
floor
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
am
just
speaking
to
mr.
chief
justice
is
the
words
of
the
committee
reports,
which
are
quoted
in
the
majority
opinion.
they
simply
state
that
the
result
of
not
covering
this
area
is
that
state
law
remains.
that's
a
far
cry
from
saying,
we
are
doing
this
because
we
think
it's
important
to
preserve
state
remedies
in
the
three-mile
area.
now,
as
i've
suggested
a
moment
ago,
it
seems
to
us
the
obvious
reason
why
congress
stopped
at
the
three-mile
line
was
because
there
was
no
problem
within
that
area
then.
there
was
a
problem
beyond,
nobody
quite
knew
what
if
any
law
would
apply.
obviously,
the
coastal
law,
the
state
couldn't
apply
beyond
three
miles,
it
was
beyond
the
state
boundary.
so
what
law
could
apply?
one
decision
of
this
court,
it
suggested
that
at
least
where
the
defendant
and
plaintiff
were
of
the
same
stage,
you
could
apply
the
state
law,
if
it
was
meant
to
apply.
but
state
laws
normally
didn't
mean
to
govern
accident
on
the
high
seas.
and
there
was
a
vacuum
there,
which
congress
quite
reasonably
thought
it
necessary
to
fill.
as
i've
also
suggested,
there
were
those
who
wanted
to
preserve
state
remedies
within
the
three-mile
area,
because
they
were
familiar
with
them
or
because
they
viewed
them
as
more
generous
than
the
pending
federal
legislation.
those
are
hardly
reasons
for
this
court
today
to
hesitate,
to
erase
that
distinction.
a
distinction
which
then
was
not
as
great
as
it
is
now,
because
then
un-seaworthiness
remedies
were
unknown
for
practical
purposes
and
the
remedy
beyond
three
miles
was
no
greater
than
what
state
wrongful
death
act
supplied
within
the
three-mile
area.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
basically
yes
mr.
justice
white,
though
i
must
point
out
that
by
overruling
harrisburg
is
not
fashioning
a
whole
new
body
of
federal
law.
it's
simply
removing
the
bar
to
access
to
the
existing
federal
law.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
now,
there
are
some
details
that
have
to
be
worked
out.
i
wouldn't
have
thought
statute
limitations
is
one
of
them,
i
would
have
thought
the
normal
admiralty
rule
obliges
would
apply
as
it
does
in
every
other
suit
(voice
overlap).
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
to
beneficiaries,
there
could
be
a
reference
to
state
law,
thought
i'm
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
death
on
a
high
seas
act
has
a
list
of
beneficiaries,
the
only
ones
you
can
take,
the
jones
act
has
a
list
of
beneficiaries,
unfortunately
not
identical.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mostly
the
same.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
the
normal
thing
for
a
federal
court
to
do,
faced
with
that
problem
would
be
to
borrow
from
the
federal
statutory
law,
which
governs
the
same
conduct
or
be
it
beyond
the
three-mile
area.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that
was
respect
to
the
three
year
statute
limitations
of
the
jones
act,
which
was
borrowed
when
the
two
suits
were
brought
together.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
would
have
thought
that
one
would
want
a
uniform
rule,
which
remember
that
overruling
the
harrisburg
will
--
permit
suits
not
only
by
longshoreman
but
also
by
seaman,
and
also
by
passengers,
all
of
which
is
(voice
overlap).
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
but
they
would
be
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
harrisburg
now
bars
a
suit
for
negligence,
for
wrongful
death
--
negligence.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
harrisburg
likewise
bars
a
suit
for
wrongful
death
due
to
negligence.
except
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
beyond
three
miles,
all
for
the
seaman
under
the
jones
act.
but
as
to
the
longshoreman,
who
has
a
suit
against
the
ship
owner
for
negligent
injury
are
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
he
has
no
suit
for
negligent
killing,
because
of
the
harrisburg.
i
hesitate
to
suggest
that
the
court
ought
to
look
to
the
longshoreman
act
when
the
plaintiffs
longshoreman
to
the
jones
act
and
the
plaintiff
is
a
seaman
and
to
death
on
the
high
seas
act
when
the
plaintiff
is
a
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
a
passenger,
though
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it's
just
--
i
would
suppose
that
it
were
complicated,
unduly
complicated,
but
i
don't
--
they
said
inappropriateness
to
that
and
i
don't
reject
it
as
one
alternative.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
as
the
substantive
or
admiralty
law
of
(voice
overlap).
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
seaworthiness
contributory
negligence,
no
negligence
is
relevant
in
a
negligence
case
under
the
maritime
law,
comparative
negligence
is
the
rule,
not
contributory
negligence.
all
of
those
substantive
rules
would
have
caused
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
only
thing
to
be
fashioned
is
a
question
of
who
may
file
the
suit
whether
it's
the
widow
and
the
children
or
only
the
dependents,
or
only
the
small
children
are
--
and
how
you
divide
it
up
between
them,
and
those
questions
are
largely
answered
if
one
borrows
from
the
federal
law.
there
is
no
occasion
to
borrow
from
the
law
of
the
coastal
state.
it
has
no
conceivable
interest
in
those
questions.
the
only
state
that
has
any
interest
in
those
questions
is
the
state
of
the
domicile
of
the
survivor.
but
the
coastal
state
has
no
legitimate
claim
to
controlling
accidents
otherwise
governed
by
maritime,
federal
maritime
law,
although
within
its
own
waters.
for
these
reasons,
we
suggest
that
the
judgment
ought
to
be
reversed
and
that
in
so
doing,
the
court
should
overrule
the
harrisburg
and
the
tungus.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
suppose
it
was
judicially
announced
or
created.
i
suppose
you
could
say,
as
part
of
a
recognition
of
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
is
here
in
this
case,
pursuant
to
the
court's
invitation
to
file
a
brief
and
to
participate
in
the
oral
argument
of
the
case.
we
have
devoted
our
submission
primarily
to
the
proposition
that
the
harrisburg,
in
answer
to
the
court's
question
ought
to
be
overruled.
incidentally,
we
see
no
difficulty,
and
that's
being
done
in
a
diversity
case,
it
has
been
clear,
i
think
that
a
state
court
may
apply
admiralty
law
at
the
federal
court
to
which
such
and
causes
removed
under
the
diversity
of
jurisdiction
may
likewise
do
so.
although,
the
case
could
not
have
been
brought
on
the
law
side
of
the
federal
court
originally,
the
absence
of
diversity
of
system.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
thought
mr.
justice
stewart
this
court
had
long
settled
that
under
the
savings
pursued
as
clause,
state
courts,
all
federal
courts
acting
as
state
courts
that
is
under
that
diversity,
jurisdiction
applied
federal
maritime
law
in
all
maritime
cases.
at
the
election
of
the
plaintiff,
otherwise
admiralty
sought
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
may
be
a
problem
of
pleading.
there
maybe
a
problem
of
pleading.
there's
no
problem
of
jurisdiction.
the
court
here,
just
as
mr.
justice
brennan
said
a
moment
ago,
that
this
has
been
a
possible
injury
case,
the
claim
could
have
been
under
the
warranty
of
sea
worthiness,
a
federal
claim.
and
it
could
have
been
vindicated
in
the
state
court
or
in
the
federal
court
under
diversity.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
there
is
no
difference
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
except
to
the
extent
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
claim
was
unseaworthiness
as
recognized
by
the
state
wrongful
death
statute.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
however,
as
i
read
the
complaint,
the
suit
is
brought
simply
alleging
a
claim
for
wrongful
death
and
unseaworthiness
without
particularly
or
uniquely
invoking
the
state
wrongful
death
statute.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
nor
does
count
4,
which
is
also
an
unseaworthiness
count,
though
for
the
seaman's
--
longshoreman
own
injury.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
would
have
been
the
federal
maritime
law
of
unseaworthiness
as
to
count
2
of
the
complaint,
which
is
the
only
here
at
issue,
which
is
enforceable
in
both
the
state
court.
and
on
the
law
side
of
the
federal
court
under
the
diversity
head
of
jurisdiction,
as
well
as
in
admiralty
without
a
jury,
without
diversity.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
with
no
statute,
whatever,
there
would
have
been
a
right
to
sue
for
the
injury.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
as
suggested
here
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
once
the
harrisburg
is
overruled,
as
we
think
--
as
we
submit
to
the
court
it
should
be,
there
will
likewise
be
a
right
to
sue
for
wrongful
death
without
a
statute,
without
invoking
of
the
state
wrongful
death
statutes.
and
so,
in
that
sense,
this
is
exactly
the
same
case,
it
would
be
for
personal
injury
in
the
right
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
reason
of
jurisdictional
problem,
there
maybe
a
question
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
pleading,
though
i
don't
think
there's
any
problem
as
sufficiency
to
complaint.
there
maybe
some
question
as
to
the
plaintiff's
agreeing
that
the
matter
are
to
be
determined
at
the
period
of
time
by
reference
to
the
florida
law,
when
the
certification
to
the
florida
supreme
court
was
made.
however,
it
really
is
not
my
place
to
speak
to
any
defect
in
the
way
the
plaintiff
brought
the
suit
here.
we
must
assume,
that
the
question
is
before
the
court
and
answer
it
as
the
court
requested
that
we
do.
the
faults
of
--
and
the
problems
created
by
the
decision
in
the
harrisburg
have
been
sufficiently
exposed.
the
underlying
principles
of
both
the
common
law
rule,
denying
recovery
for
wrongful
death,
and
the
application
of
that
rule
to
admiralty
have
been
criticized
by
so
many
eminent
jurists
and
scholars
that
i
need
hardly
add
anything
to
what
they've
said,
mentioning
only
that
they
include
mr.
justice
holmes,
judge
learned
hand,
dean
prosser
and
dean
pound.
congress
in
one
sense,
has
also
repudiated
the
result,
which
the
harrisburg
required
by
enacting
the
federal
statutes
which
to
a
lot
extent
supplant
the
state
laws
and
notably
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
though
it
stops
three-mile
line
and
the
jones
act,
which
covers
all
maritime
waters
built
only
with
respect
to
true
seaman.
the
harrisburg
is
today
whatever
the
correctness
of
the
decision
at
the
time,
and
there's
some
reason
to
question
that
is
today
an
anachronism.
it
creates
a
series
of
anomalies,
which
are
not
mere
anomalies,
they're
arbitrary
results
often
unjust
and
very
much
it
adds
with
the
desirable
uniformity
of
the
admiralty
law.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
no
question
whatever,
mr.
chief
justice
that
congress
could
and
as
the
other
side
will
--
i'm
sure
point
out,
there
is
pending
appeal
which
would
have
some
such
result,
though
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they
did
alter
to
the
extent
of
the
high
seas,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
did
alter
it,
to
the
extent
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
jones
act
for
the
entire
coverage
of
maritime
law,
but
only
with
respect
to
seaman,
so
we
really
have
a
small
area
left,
which
congress
--
the
reasons
which
i
will
try
to
explain
in
the
moment,
did
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
within
the
three-mile
limit,
yes
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
so
putting
it
the
other
way
mr.
justice
stewart,
we've
said
they
should
not
have
less
rights
than
because
the
action
had
occurred
beyond
the
three-mile
limit
nor
they
should
have
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'll
come
to
that
mr.
justice
stewart.
let
me
say
that
the
anomalies
created
are
really
three.
the
same
conduct,
which
imposes
liability
on
ship
owners,
produces
one
result
if
the
man
--
if
the
victim
is
injured,
it
produces
often
a
different
result,
the
man
is
killed,
there
is
no
rhyme
or
reason
to
that.
likewise,
the
same
conduct
by
the
ship
owner
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
there
is
--
mr.
justice
stewart
there
is
no
state
law,
which
provides
no
remedy
when
the
man
is
killed
while
providing
remedy
for
the
same
conduct,
when
the
man
is
merely
injured.
it
maybe
degrees
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
same
conduct,
which
in
this
case,
this
purpose
is
unseaworthiness
of
the
vessel
affords
no
remedy
under
florida
law,
when
the
seaman
died,
when
the
longshoreman
died,
whereas
it
affords
a
remedy
as
it
must
under
federal
or
when
the
longshoreman
is
injured,
so
it's
an
all
or
nothing
proposition.
likewise,
the
same
conduct
may
give
rise
to
an
obligation
to
pay
and
the
right
of
recovery,
depending
on
whether
it
happens
within
or
outside
the
three-mile
limit.
a
line
which
makes
no
sense
in
terms
of
the
maritime
jurisdiction,
which
covers
the
entire
area.
and
finally
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
i
think
it
--
as
i
will
suggest
it
did
have
some
basis.
i'm
suggesting
that
the
result,
which
i
don't
think
it
was
intended
by
congress,
because
of
the
differences
in
the
law
that
existed
has
now
become
acute
and
arbitrary,
though
i
don't
impute
any
such
purpose
to
the
congress
in
1920,
when
the
remedies,
were
quite
different,
and
the
state
laws
quite
adequately
state
wrongful
death
statutes,
quite
adequately
covered
the
three-mile
area.
beyond
that
there
was
a
confused
situation,
some
form
of
vacuum,
and
at
least
in
appropriate
place
to
an
urgent
need
to
provide
a
law,
a
law
that
was
thought
comparable
to
the
state
remedy,
provided
by
the
wrongful
death
actions.
indeed,
the
suggestion
is
that
the
state
law
was
more
generous
than
the
new
federal
and
some
complaint
do
not
displace
the
state
law
within
the
three-mile
area,
to
have
now
turned
round,
seems
to
impute
a
very
strange
notion,
the
congressional
purpose.
now
strange
as
to
all
the
anomalies
produced
by
the
harrisburg,
as
construed
in
the
tungus,
is
that
true
seaman
are
often
less
able
to
recover
than
those
who
recover
for
unseaworthiness
or
other
seaman's
remedies
only
because
they
do
the
work
as
barely
performed
by
seaman,
so
called
seriaki
seaman.
so
the
question
arises
why
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
how
can
that
be?
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
because
under
this
court's
decision,
in
lindgren
and
in
gillespie,
a
seaman
who
is
killed,
its
survivors
cannot
resort
to
state
wrongful
death
act,
even
where
that
state
wrongful
death
act
would
provide
a
remedy
for
unseaworthiness,
but
as
defined
in
the
jones
act
remedy
for
negligence.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
therefore,
in
the
tungus,
that
remedy
would
not
have
been
available
to
a
seaman,
because
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
he
wasn't,
but
the
seaman
would
not
have
had
the
benefit
of
the
ruling
of
the
tungus,
given
the
fact
that
new
jersey
law
did
provide
that
remedy.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
which
does
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i'm
assuming
there's
a
difference,
and
in
this
case,
the
assumption
is
there's
a
difference
between
unseaworthiness
and
negligence,
though
i
recognize
that
negligence
under
the
jones
act
is
a
broader
concept
than
negligence
under
florida's
law.
and
it
must
be
--
there
has
to
be
a
reason
for
not
setting
things
right.
there
could
be
three
reasons,
the
first
is
that
a
long
time
has
passed
and
it's
too
late,
that
this
court
has
made
a
lot
of
decisions
premised
on
the
harrisburg,
and
that
congress
has
legislated
against
that
background.
and
it
uses
a
practical
matter
impossible
to
undue
80
years
of
legislation
in
jurisprudence.
the
remarkable
fact
is
that
that
is
not
true.
a
simple
overruling
of
the
harrisburg
would
recreate
the
uniformity,
basic
uniformity
in
the
maritime
law.
and
it
would
erase
all
the
harsh
anomalies
that
are
dispensable.
now,
in
saying
that
i
assume
that
overly
what
harrisburg
carries
with
it,
first
day
proposition
that
now,
that
federal
law,
federal
substantive
law
is
available
in
death
cases.
there
can
be
no
resort
to
state
laws,
even
more
favorable
to
state
laws.
therefore,
the
anomalies
resulted
in
hess
versus
united
states,
about
which
mr.
justice
harlan
and
others
complained
would
no
longer
obtain.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that
is
the
second
argument
against
repealing
the
harrisburg
by
judicial
action
rather
than
by
legislative
action.
there
were
statements
in
the
decision,
in
the
majority
decision
in
the
tungus
to
the
effect
that
congress
drew
a
knowing
line
between
the
three
miles
and
beyond
three
miles.
that
it
explicitly
or
clearly
intended
to
preserve
state
remedies
within
the
three-mile
area.
having
looked
at
the
legislative
history,
we
noticed
first
that
the
committee
report
say
no
such
thing
they
simply
notice
the
result
that
state
laws
will
remain
available
within
the
three-mile
area.
that
is
not
to
say
that
congress
consciously
meant
to
preserve
that
situation
forever.
the
stray
remarks
that
were
made
on
the
floor
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
am
just
speaking
to
mr.
chief
justice
is
the
words
of
the
committee
reports,
which
are
quoted
in
the
majority
opinion.
they
simply
state
that
the
result
of
not
covering
this
area
is
that
state
law
remains.
that's
a
far
cry
from
saying,
we
are
doing
this
because
we
think
it's
important
to
preserve
state
remedies
in
the
three-mile
area.
now,
as
i've
suggested
a
moment
ago,
it
seems
to
us
the
obvious
reason
why
congress
stopped
at
the
three-mile
line
was
because
there
was
no
problem
within
that
area
then.
there
was
a
problem
beyond,
nobody
quite
knew
what
if
any
law
would
apply.
obviously,
the
coastal
law,
the
state
couldn't
apply
beyond
three
miles,
it
was
beyond
the
state
boundary.
so
what
law
could
apply?
one
decision
of
this
court,
it
suggested
that
at
least
where
the
defendant
and
plaintiff
were
of
the
same
stage,
you
could
apply
the
state
law,
if
it
was
meant
to
apply.
but
state
laws
normally
didn't
mean
to
govern
accident
on
the
high
seas.
and
there
was
a
vacuum
there,
which
congress
quite
reasonably
thought
it
necessary
to
fill.
as
i've
also
suggested,
there
were
those
who
wanted
to
preserve
state
remedies
within
the
three-mile
area,
because
they
were
familiar
with
them
or
because
they
viewed
them
as
more
generous
than
the
pending
federal
legislation.
those
are
hardly
reasons
for
this
court
today
to
hesitate,
to
erase
that
distinction.
a
distinction
which
then
was
not
as
great
as
it
is
now,
because
then
un-seaworthiness
remedies
were
unknown
for
practical
purposes
and
the
remedy
beyond
three
miles
was
no
greater
than
what
state
wrongful
death
act
supplied
within
the
three-mile
area.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
basically
yes
mr.
justice
white,
though
i
must
point
out
that
by
overruling
harrisburg
is
not
fashioning
a
whole
new
body
of
federal
law.
it's
simply
removing
the
bar
to
access
to
the
existing
federal
law.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
now,
there
are
some
details
that
have
to
be
worked
out.
i
wouldn't
have
thought
statute
limitations
is
one
of
them,
i
would
have
thought
the
normal
admiralty
rule
obliges
would
apply
as
it
does
in
every
other
suit
(voice
overlap).
mr.

as
to
beneficiaries,
there
could
be
a
reference
to
state
law,
thought
i'm
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
death
on
a
high
seas
act
has
a
list
of
beneficiaries,
the
only
ones
you
can
take,
the
jones
act
has
a
list
of
beneficiaries,
unfortunately
not
identical.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mostly
the
same.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
the
normal
thing
for
a
federal
court
to
do,
faced
with
that
problem
would
be
to
borrow
from
the
federal
statutory
law,
which
governs
the
same
conduct
or
be
it
beyond
the
three-mile
area.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that
was
respect
to
the
three
year
statute
limitations
of
the
jones
act,
which
was
borrowed
when
the
two
suits
were
brought
together.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
would
have
thought
that
one
would
want
a
uniform
rule,
which
remember
that
overruling
the
harrisburg
will
--
permit
suits
not
only
by
longshoreman
but
also
by
seaman,
and
also
by
passengers,
all
of
which
is
(voice
overlap).
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
but
they
would
be
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
harrisburg
now
bars
a
suit
for
negligence,
for
wrongful
death
--
negligence.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
harrisburg
likewise
bars
a
suit
for
wrongful
death
due
to
negligence.
except
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
beyond
three
miles,
all
for
the
seaman
under
the
jones
act.
but
as
to
the
longshoreman,
who
has
a
suit
against
the
ship
owner
for
negligent
injury
are
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
he
has
no
suit
for
negligent
killing,
because
of
the
harrisburg.
i
hesitate
to
suggest
that
the
court
ought
to
look
to
the
longshoreman
act
when
the
plaintiffs
longshoreman
to
the
jones
act
and
the
plaintiff
is
a
seaman
and
to
death
on
the
high
seas
act
when
the
plaintiff
is
a
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
a
passenger,
though
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it's
just
--
i
would
suppose
that
it
were
complicated,
unduly
complicated,
but
i
don't
--
they
said
inappropriateness
to
that
and
i
don't
reject
it
as
one
alternative.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
as
the
substantive
or
admiralty
law
of
(voice
overlap).
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
seaworthiness
contributory
negligence,
no
negligence
is
relevant
in
a
negligence
case
under
the
maritime
law,
comparative
negligence
is
the
rule,
not
contributory
negligence.
all
of
those
substantive
rules
would
have
caused
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
only
thing
to
be
fashioned
is
a
question
of
who
may
file
the
suit
whether
it's
the
widow
and
the
children
or
only
the
dependents,
or
only
the
small
children
are
--
and
how
you
divide
it
up
between
them,
and
those
questions
are
largely
answered
if
one
borrows
from
the
federal
law.
there
is
no
occasion
to
borrow
from
the
law
of
the
coastal
state.
it
has
no
conceivable
interest
in
those
questions.
the
only
state
that
has
any
interest
in
those
questions
is
the
state
of
the
domicile
of
the
survivor.
but
the
coastal
state
has
no
legitimate
claim
to
controlling
accidents
otherwise
governed
by
maritime,
federal
maritime
law,
although
within
its
own
waters.
for
these
reasons,
we
suggest
that
the
judgment
ought
to
be
reversed
and
that
in
so
doing,
the
court
should
overrule
the
harrisburg
and
the
tungus.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
suppose
it
was
judicially
announced
or
created.
i
suppose
you
could
say,
as
part
of
a
recognition
of
the
