mr.
charles
hardee
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
edward
moragne
sr.
was
a
longshoreman
employed
in
the
port
of
tampa,
by
gulf
florida
terminal
corporation,
which
is
a
respondent
in
this
case,
and
was
his
employer,
the
stevedores.
on
december
31,
1964,
he
was
killed
when
a
hedge
beam
fell,
became
lose
and
fell
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
hole,
where
he
was
discharging
cargo,
on
the
ss
palmetto
state,
a
vessel
owned
by
the
respondent
states
marine
lines,
inc.
the
vessel
was
docked
up
here
in
tampa
on
navigable
waters
of
united
states.
his
widow,
the
plaintiff
petsonella
moragne,
or
herself
and
her
two
minor
children
filed
suit
in
the
state
court
in
four
counts.
two
counts
under
the
states
wrongful
death
act
and
to
claim
damages
under
the
act.
one
count
in
negligence
to
unseaworthiness.
and
two
counts
under
the
states
survivor
act
for
damages
of
personal
representative
and
for
damages
to
the
state.
the
case
was
removed
at
the
instance
of
states
marine
lines,
inc.
to
the
federal
district
court
in
tampa.
and
then
upon
motions
by
both
respondents,
after
a
third
party
complaint
was
filed
for
indemnity
by
the
ship
owner
against
the
stevedore.
the
district
judge
struck
count
two
which
had
to
with
unseaworthiness
and
based
his
decision
upon
two
cases
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
ground
against
a.
lusi
limited
and
emerson
against
holloway
concrete
products
company,
which
held
that
florida
common
law
applied
and
was
applicable
under
the
florida
wrongful
death
statute.
one
of
these
cases
were
decided
in
1953,
the
other
was
decided
with
a
vigorous
dissent
by
judge
brown
in
1960,
right
after
this
court
came,
issued
its
opinion
in
the
congress.
but
the
district
judge
was
concerned
about
the
correctness
of
its
ruling
and
pursuant
to
the
appropriate
rule,
gave
language
in
his
opinion,
which
allowed
us
to
petition
for
an
interlocutory
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
granted
our
interlocutory
appeal
and
then
upon
the
request
of
the
respondent
states
marine
lines
certified
the
question
involved
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
the
florida
supreme
court
held
that
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
if
that
is
not
applicable
under
the
florida
wrongful
death
act.
we
then
requested
the
court
of
appeals
to
ignore
this
opinion
on
a
certified
question
of
the
florida
supreme
court
and
raise
the
constitutional
questions
which
are
here
before
this
court.
argument
was
held,
briefs
were
fully
made
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
took
a
considerable
time
working
with
the
issue,
and
then
finally
in
its
opinion,
said
they
felt
nevertheless
bound
by
the
tungus
to
accord
to
the
florida
supreme
court
or
the
florida
courts,
the
right
to
decide
what
substantive
law
was
applicable
to
maritime
deaths
occurring
on
navigable
waters
of
united
states
within
the
territorial
limits
of
florida.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
hardee
alright
sir,
let's
assume
that
the
injury
had
not
resulted
in
death.
the
case
could
--
would
still
had
been
removable
for
a
personal
injury
not
resulted
in
--
mr.
charles
hardee
under
diversity
jurisdiction,
but
federal
law
--
federal
maritime
law
would
have
applied
in
the
state
court
or
in
the
district
court,
under
diversity
jurisdiction
or
on
the
admiralty
side
of
the
court
had
the
plaintiff
chosen
to
go
there.
mr.
charles
hardee
no
sir
because
this
was
a
death.
this
was
not
an
injury.
mr.
charles
hardee
but,
your
honor
we
thought
for
negligence.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir,
well
we
--
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir,
i
understand
your
feelings
first.
mr.
justice
stewart
and
we
were
proceeding
under
what
we
felt
and
apparently
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
agrees
with
us,
what
we
felt
was
the
compulsion
of
the
majority
ruling
in
the
tungus.
and
every
other
state,
since
tungus,
which
is
decided
this
question,
some
eleven
major
maritime
states
have
held
that
the
wrongful
death
statute
of
those
states
incorporate
admiralty
substantive
law,
it's
only
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
hardee
but
what's
the
difference,
if
you
please
the
court.
i
mean
--
i
frankly
don't
see
the
difference,
that's
a
--
mr.
charles
hardee
alright
sir,
well
--
mr.
charles
hardee
no
sir,
i
had
considered
the
case
to
be
under
the
admiralty
law
from
the
beginning.
this
is
the
whole
issue
involved
and
the
state
court
--
not
on
the
admiralty
side
of
court,
but
at
maritime
law
applied
under
the
florida
wrongful
death
statute.
this
has
been
the
position
of
the
plaintiff
from
the
beginning.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
it's
my
claim
that
maritime
substantive
law
must
apply
under
the
state's
wrongful
death
statute
to
a
maritime
death,
which
occurs
on
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
within
the
state's
territorial
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
hardee
no
sir,
i
haven't
got
in
the
harrisburg
yet,
i
would
be
glad
to
talk
about
the
harrisburg.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir,
i
think
i
will.
alright,
so
that
--
what
in
effect
happened
in
this
case
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
florida
law
to
a
maritime
death
occurring
within
the
territorial
waters
of
florida,
under
the
compulsion
of
the
tungus
and
applied
substantive
law,
which
conflicted
with
the
duties
and
obligations
which
are
routed
in
maritime
law.
speaking
there
of
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness.
there's
no
question
about
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
is
a
duty,
and
an
obligation
of
a
ship
owner
which
is
owed
to
a
longshoreman.
and
in
the
case
of
injury
of
violat
ion
of
this
duty
produces
the
right
to
sue.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
hardee
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
i
say
first
of
all
that
moragne
has
been
decided
that
the
fears
expressed
by
the
minority
in
tungus
have
come
to
fruition.
and
the
state
of
florida
has
caused
to
be
applied
to
maritime
deaths
in
florida
are
ruled
different
from
the
substantive
admiralty
rule
or
a
law.
so
that
i
think
if
this
court
recedes
from
the
majority
reasoning
in
tungus
and
does
what
the
minority
suggest,
my
client
is
protected
in
this
case.
this
court
asked
the
parties
to
brief
the
question
of
whether
the
harrisburg
should
be
overruled.
and
i
have
taken
the
position
that
it
should
be
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
harrisburg
of
course
is
a
very
careful,
well
reasoned
and
thought
out
decision.
the
problem
is
that
i
think
the
court
in
the
harrisburg
at
that
time
went
a
stray
on
a
couple
of
matters.
first
of
all,
the
civil
law
had
traditionally
been
the
law
applied
in
admiralty
in
england
and
in
this
country.
the
court's
generally
got
to
the
civil
law,
now
this
is
not
to
say
that
courts
might
not
look
to
the
common
law,
but
at
that
time
swift
against
tyson
was
in
effect,
and
it
was
assumed
to
be
a
federal
uniform,
some
uniform
federal
common
law.
so
that
i
think
swift
against
tyson
had
some
effect
on
the
court.
and
of
course,
that's
been
laid
to
rest
in
1936
and
1938.
but,
in
looking
to
the
common
law,
if
a
court
in
admiralty
were
going
to
law
or
applying
maritime
law
would
go
and
look
to
the
common
law.
it
seem
to
me
the
court
would
look
in
and
find
a
doctrine
of
the
common
law,
which
was
a
progressive,
a
good
and
doctrine
that
everyone
said
this
is
wonderful
in
it's
something
that
should
be
adopted
by
the
admiralty.
but
in
this
case,
the
court
adopted
a
rule
of
the
common
law,
which
had
been
abrogated
40
years
before
by
the
english
parliament,
which
had
been
criticized
by
everybody
that
ever
said
anything
about
it,
which
everybody
agreed
was
a
terrible
rule,
the
common
law,
and
which
everybody
agrees,
they
think
it's
a
terrible
rule.
so
admiralty
went
out
from
the
civil
law
theme
to
engraft
into
maritime
law
a
rule
of
the
common
law,
which
nobody
defends.
that
is
that
there's
no
right
of
action
for
wrongful
death
absent
the
statute.
and
this
is
where
the
point
here.
mr.
charles
hardee
the
wrongful
death
act
in
florida
was
originally
thought
to
be
a
lord
campbell's
act.
mr.
charles
hardee
it's
a
statute,
yes
sir.
it's
a
lord
campbell's
type
statute.
however,
it
was
amended
in
1953
to
provide
for
actions
ex
contractu,
as
well
as
actions
ex
delicto,
which
brought
in
the
field
of
implied
warranty
of
food
stuffs
and
product
liability
and
so
on.
so,
that
is
not
a
technically
any
longer
really
a
lord
campbell's
act.
so
that
the
harrisburg
now
has
resulted
by
evolution
in
the
situation
that
we
find
ourselves
now
in
moragne
and
that
is
where
the
state
of
florida
has
effectively
abolished
the
warranty
of
sea
worthiness,
which
is
in
deeply
engrafted
in
admiralty
and
maritime
law.
so
that
a
longshoreman,
who
is
healed
as
distinguished
could
be
an
injured
on
navigable
waters
of
the
state
of
florida,
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states,
within
the
state
of
florida
is
deprived
of
this
doctrine
as
warranty
of
seaworthiness.
and
is
relegated
to
common
law
and
negligence,
which
is
very
different
type
now,
from
the
negligence
that
we
know
in
maritime
law.
i
think
that
it's
been
traditional
in
admiralty
courts,
and
the
supreme
court
in
particular
has
fashioned
admiralty
remedies
and
admiralty
law
where
necessary.
i
need
only
point
out
a
few
for
instance
in
this
case,
the
ship
owner
is
seeking
indemnity
against
the
stevedore.
the
indemnity
of
a
ship
owner
against
the
stevedore
was
fashioned
by
the
court
in
the
ryan
case
and
substantive
cases.
so,
we
have
indemnity
involved
in
this
case,
in
this
very
case,
which
is
a
court
made
or
court
fashioned
maritime
doctrine,
which
is
unknown
in
the
state
of
florida,
but
it's
going
to
be
an
issue
in
this
case,
and
yet
the
respondents
say
that
the
plaintiff,
the
petitioner
here
should
be
relegated
the
state
law,
as
far
as
her
rights
for
death
are
concerned
to
turn
on
navigable
waters.
but
they
turned
around
and
seeked
the
benefit
of
the
court
fashioned,
right
of
indemnity
against
the
stevedore,
of
course
the
duty
of
--
the
warranty
of
sea
worthiness
is
a
thing
that
has
been
fashioned
by
the
court.
and
the
impleader
rules
had
been
fashioned
by
the
court.
i'd
like
to
point
out
one
other
thing.
back
in
the
1917
to
1924,
starting
with
the
jensen
case,
the
supreme
court
held
that
a
state
law,
workmen's
compensation
law,
could
not
validly
be
applied
to
maritime
injuries
or
death
occurring
on
state
waters.
after
the
jensen's
case
the
congress
had
passed
a
statute,
which
can
be
effective
of
placing
state
workmen's
compensation
laws
over
these
injuries
and
death.
and
the
court
–
and
the
nicker
barker
case,
said
you
can't
do
that,
that's
unconstitutional.
so
then,
the
congress
came
back
and
passed
another
statute
of
the
same
title
exempting
members,
masters
and
members
of
vessels.
and
the
court
again
said,
you
cannot
constitutionally
apply
a
state
statute,
workmen's
compensation
statute,
to
injuries
or
death
occurring
on
maritime
waters.
it
seems
to
me
in
the
tungus,
that
this
court
has
done
in
maritime
deaths,
what
the
court
three
times
said
back
in
1917
and
1924
that
the
congress
could
not
constitutionally
do.
so
that
i
urge
this
court,
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may,
and
i
urge
this
court
to
receive
from
the
majority
reasoning
in
tungus
and
to
overrule
the
harrisburg.
mr.
charles
hardee
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there's
one
area
in
particular
that
i
think
we
want
to
be
certain
that
we
have
cleared
up.
as
we
understand
the
law
at
present,
a
seaman
has
a
right
or
the
heirs
of
a
dead
seaman
have
a
right
to
recover
for
negligence
within
the
territorial
waters
of
the
united
states.
and
for
negligence
and
un-seaworthiness
beyond
the
three-mile
limit,
by
virtue
of
the
jones
act
and
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
mr.
charles
hardee
right.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir,
this
court
has
never
made
a
decision
on
that,
but
gilmore
and
black
at
page
304
in
their
previous
decision.
mr.
charles
hardee
just
like
that,
new
jersey
statute
in
tungus,
if
it's
a
--
mr.
charles
hardee
act
in
neglect
or
default
i
think
is
the
exact
words
of
it
or
in
simple
language.
mr.
charles
hardee
unseaworthiness
and
the
federal
courts,
the
chairman
seaman
against
--
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir
and
under
the
death
on
a
high
seas
act,
the
seaman
have
been
allowed
to
recover
for
unseaworthiness
or
the
heirs
of
the
seaman
have
been
allowed
to
recover
for
unseaworthiness
in
a
death
act,
so
--
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir
and
--
mr.
charles
hardee
in
chermesino
against
the
vessel
judith
lee
rose,
which
was
recorded
in
the
federal
supplement
also
went
to
second
circuit
--
mr.
charles
hardee
no,
sir
cert
was
denied
in
that
case
but
this
court
has
never
written
an
opinion
on
this
question.
but
gilmore
and
black
have
said
that
all
of
the
lower
court
decisions
are
to
disaffect
and
he
assumes
that
this
court
would
withhold
that.
mr.
charles
hardee
1920,
the
same
year
mr.
justice
white
as
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
mr.
charles
hardee
i
think
as
the
government
suggested,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
was
intended
by
congress
to
fill
a
void
or
a
vacuum
--
mr.
charles
hardee
no
sir,
it
includes
everybody,
seaman
and
non-seaman
--
mr.
charles
hardee
well,
i'm
sure
it
wasn't
--
the
purpose
wasn't
to
cover
seaman
because
it
passed
the
jones
act
the
same
year.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
hardee
any
person,
that's
right.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
and
gilmore
and
black
suggested
the
lower
courts
have
held,
they're
thinking
can
recover
under
either
theory
or
both.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes,
they're
slightly
different,
they
are.
now,
what
this
brings
us
to
is
this,
that
a
seaman
does
not
have
--
or
the
heirs
of
a
dead
seaman
do
not
have
the
right
to
recover
for
unseaworthiness
within
the
territorial
waters
of
the
united
states,
by
a
reason
of
lindgren
and
gellispie.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
charles
hardee
well,
that's
right
because
the
warranty
doesn't
apply
to
--
extended
to
apply
to
a
vesture,
unless
the
failure
was
a
negligence
failure
to
find
as
in
seaworthiness,
but
--
mr.
charles
hardee
a
longshoreman
may
recover
in
all
the
states,
except
florida
that
it
decided
the
question.
both
for
negligence
and
for
unseaworthiness
in
the
territorial
waters
of
the
united
states,
so
that
a
seaman
for
whom
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness
was
originally
fashioned
in
the
aziola
has
a
left
right
by
reason
of
the
preemption
problem
that
confronted
the
court
in
lindgren
and
gellispie
that
longshoreman
have.
mr.
charles
hardee
because
he
has
no
--
he
does
not
have
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
does
not
extend
to
him
in
a
death
case
within
the
territorial
waters
of
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
hardee
well,
under
tungus,
in
new
jersey,
in
new
york.
mr.
charles
hardee
because
in
gillespie,
the
longshoreman
can
take
advantage
of
it
by
reason
of
tungus,
because
he
sues
under
the
state
death
act.
but
in
gillespie,
the
court
held
that
the
jones
act
preempted
state
act.
mr.
charles
hardee
so
that's
--
well,
this
is
what
i'm
saying,
this
is
why
a
seaman
cannot
recover
from
and/or
the
heirs
of
a
seaman
who
has
been
killed,
cannot
recover
for
unseaworthiness
within
the
territorial
waters
of
the
united
states
--
mr.
charles
hardee
within
territorial
waters
of
the
untied
states.
mr.
charles
hardee
right.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
now,
what
we're
saying
is
if
this
court
overrules
the
harrisburg,
then
the
court
of
necessity
has
in
effect
overrule
gellispie.
and
the
range
that
seaman
have
are
the
same
then
as
the
rights
of
longshoreman
have,
and
we
have
a
complete
uniformity,
as
far
as
death
cases
are
concerned.
we
were
not
sure
whether
we
made
this
clear.
mr.
charles
hardee
no
sir,
but
if
this
court
overrules
the
harrisburg,
i
assume
that
the
court
then
intends
to
find
that
there
is
in
maritime
law
a
remedy
for
wrongful
death,
aside
from
any
statute.
mr.
charles
hardee
besides
many
statute
for
whatever
the
rights
would
have
been
and
if
the
man
had
been
injured,
he
had
--
he's
heirs
have
the
same
rights
if
he's
killed.
mr.
charles
hardee
no
sir,
but
i
would
suggest
that
--
mr.
charles
hardee
but
i
would
suggest
this
that
if
the
harrisburg
were
overruled
and
this
court
decided
that
there
is
a
remedy
for
wrongful
death
in
maritime
law
aside
from
the
statute,
that
the
heirs
of
a
seaman
who's
killed
on
territorial
waters
would
have
a
right
to
the
warranty
of
--
or
to
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness
--
mr.
charles
hardee
well
in
any
event,
this
is
the
way
we
see
it.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
there
are
several
--
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir,
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
that
or
to
say
we're
going
to
generally
follow
the
federal
statutes
that
are
on
existence
and
--
mr.
charles
hardee
well,
the
jones
act
or
death
on
a
high
seas
act,
there's
not
a
great
difference
between.
mr.
charles
hardee
i
don't
--
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
charles
hardee
i
don't
really
think
that
you
need
to
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
we
can
--
actually,
as
i
mentioned
in
my
brief,
i
think
the
court
should
revert
to
the
civil
law,
which
says
that
any
person
who
suffers
damages
by
the
act
of
another,
the
other
person
is
obliged
to
repair
it.
i
think
as
you
start
restricting
damages,
then
it's
going
to
create
a
lot
of
problems.
i
just
don't
see
much
of
a
problem.
mr.
charles
hardee
i
don't
think
--
is
there
any
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
general
law
on
damages.
it
says
that
his
creditors
can
come
in
and
--
mr.
charles
hardee
that
is
always
pretty
generally
uniform
--
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
hardee
i
think
you
do
that
or
--
mr.
charles
hardee
i
just
don't
see
--
mr.
charles
hardee
i
think
it's
very
simple,
i
don't
see
the
problem.
mr.
charles
hardee
that
the
respondents
see
in
this
case
or
in
that
regard.
mr.
charles
hardee
no
sir,
not
that
i
know
of.
it
certainly
didn't.
mr.
charles
hardee
no
sir,
and
i
think
(voice
overlap),
by
reason
of
the
harrisburg,
which
--
and
i
think
is
an
amicus
of
--
the
american
trial
lawyers
pointed
out
that
this
court
is
not
just
an
anchorage,
it
also
has
a
sale,
and
if
you
make
that
law,
you
can
also
repeal
it,
same
bad
law.
there's
one
other
thing
i
wanted
to
mention,
and
that
is
a
statement
made
by
the
respondents,
mrs.
moragne
has
identical
right,
under
the
florida
wrongful
death
statute
as
presently
decided
by
the
florida
supreme
court,
as
a
seaman
had.
now,
this
just
is
not
so,
in
fact
if
florida
common
law
negligence
walked
down
the
street
and
passed
jones
act
negligence,
they
wouldn't
recognize
each
other.
there's
absolutely
no
kinship
at
all
between
the
two.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir,
negligence
of
fellow
seaman,
assumption
to
risk,
all
of
those
things
go
with
the
florida.
mr.
charles
hardee
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
edward
moragne
sr.
was
a
longshoreman
employed
in
the
port
of
tampa,
by
gulf
florida
terminal
corporation,
which
is
a
respondent
in
this
case,
and
was
his
employer,
the
stevedores.
on
december
31,
1964,
he
was
killed
when
a
hedge
beam
fell,
became
lose
and
fell
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
hole,
where
he
was
discharging
cargo,
on
the
ss
palmetto
state,
a
vessel
owned
by
the
respondent
states
marine
lines,
inc.
the
vessel
was
docked
up
here
in
tampa
on
navigable
waters
of
united
states.
his
widow,
the
plaintiff
petsonella
moragne,
or
herself
and
her
two
minor
children
filed
suit
in
the
state
court
in
four
counts.
two
counts
under
the
states
wrongful
death
act
and
to
claim
damages
under
the
act.
one
count
in
negligence
to
unseaworthiness.
and
two
counts
under
the
states
survivor
act
for
damages
of
personal
representative
and
for
damages
to
the
state.
the
case
was
removed
at
the
instance
of
states
marine
lines,
inc.
to
the
federal
district
court
in
tampa.
and
then
upon
motions
by
both
respondents,
after
a
third
party
complaint
was
filed
for
indemnity
by
the
ship
owner
against
the
stevedore.
the
district
judge
struck
count
two
which
had
to
with
unseaworthiness
and
based
his
decision
upon
two
cases
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
ground
against
a.
lusi
limited
and
emerson
against
holloway
concrete
products
company,
which
held
that
florida
common
law
applied
and
was
applicable
under
the
florida
wrongful
death
statute.
one
of
these
cases
were
decided
in
1953,
the
other
was
decided
with
a
vigorous
dissent
by
judge
brown
in
1960,
right
after
this
court
came,
issued
its
opinion
in
the
congress.
but
the
district
judge
was
concerned
about
the
correctness
of
its
ruling
and
pursuant
to
the
appropriate
rule,
gave
language
in
his
opinion,
which
allowed
us
to
petition
for
an
interlocutory
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
granted
our
interlocutory
appeal
and
then
upon
the
request
of
the
respondent
states
marine
lines
certified
the
question
involved
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
the
florida
supreme
court
held
that
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
if
that
is
not
applicable
under
the
florida
wrongful
death
act.
we
then
requested
the
court
of
appeals
to
ignore
this
opinion
on
a
certified
question
of
the
florida
supreme
court
and
raise
the
constitutional
questions
which
are
here
before
this
court.
argument
was
held,
briefs
were
fully
made
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
took
a
considerable
time
working
with
the
issue,
and
then
finally
in
its
opinion,
said
they
felt
nevertheless
bound
by
the
tungus
to
accord
to
the
florida
supreme
court
or
the
florida
courts,
the
right
to
decide
what
substantive
law
was
applicable
to
maritime
deaths
occurring
on
navigable
waters
of
united
states
within
the
territorial
limits
of
florida.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
hardee
alright
sir,
let's
assume
that
the
injury
had
not
resulted
in
death.
the
case
could
--
would
still
had
been
removable
for
a
personal
injury
not
resulted
in
--
mr.
charles
hardee
under
diversity
jurisdiction,
but
federal
law
--
federal
maritime
law
would
have
applied
in
the
state
court
or
in
the
district
court,
under
diversity
jurisdiction
or
on
the
admiralty
side
of
the
court
had
the
plaintiff
chosen
to
go
there.
mr.
charles
hardee
no
sir
because
this
was
a
death.
this
was
not
an
injury.
mr.
charles
hardee
but,
your
honor
we
thought
for
negligence.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir,
well
we
--
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir,
i
understand
your
feelings
first.
mr.
justice
stewart
and
we
were
proceeding
under
what
we
felt
and
apparently
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
agrees
with
us,
what
we
felt
was
the
compulsion
of
the
majority
ruling
in
the
tungus.
and
every
other
state,
since
tungus,
which
is
decided
this
question,
some
eleven
major
maritime
states
have
held
that
the
wrongful
death
statute
of
those
states
incorporate
admiralty
substantive
law,
it's
only
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
hardee
but
what's
the
difference,
if
you
please
the
court.
i
mean
--
i
frankly
don't
see
the
difference,
that's
a
--
mr.
charles
hardee
alright
sir,
well
--
mr.
charles
hardee
no
sir,
i
had
considered
the
case
to
be
under
the
admiralty
law
from
the
beginning.
this
is
the
whole
issue
involved
and
the
state
court
--
not
on
the
admiralty
side
of
court,
but
at
maritime
law
applied
under
the
florida
wrongful
death
statute.
this
has
been
the
position
of
the
plaintiff
from
the
beginning.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
it's
my
claim
that
maritime
substantive
law
must
apply
under
the
state's
wrongful
death
statute
to
a
maritime
death,
which
occurs
on
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
within
the
state's
territorial
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
hardee
no
sir,
i
haven't
got
in
the
harrisburg
yet,
i
would
be
glad
to
talk
about
the
harrisburg.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir,
i
think
i
will.
alright,
so
that
--
what
in
effect
happened
in
this
case
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
florida
law
to
a
maritime
death
occurring
within
the
territorial
waters
of
florida,
under
the
compulsion
of
the
tungus
and
applied
substantive
law,
which
conflicted
with
the
duties
and
obligations
which
are
routed
in
maritime
law.
speaking
there
of
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness.
there's
no
question
about
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
is
a
duty,
and
an
obligation
of
a
ship
owner
which
is
owed
to
a
longshoreman.
and
in
the
case
of
injury
of
violat
ion
of
this
duty
produces
the
right
to
sue.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
hardee
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
i
say
first
of
all
that
moragne
has
been
decided
that
the
fears
expressed
by
the
minority
in
tungus
have
come
to
fruition.
and
the
state
of
florida
has
caused
to
be
applied
to
maritime
deaths
in
florida
are
ruled
different
from
the
substantive
admiralty
rule
or
a
law.
so
that
i
think
if
this
court
recedes
from
the
majority
reasoning
in
tungus
and
does
what
the
minority
suggest,
my
client
is
protected
in
this
case.
this
court
asked
the
parties
to
brief
the
question
of
whether
the
harrisburg
should
be
overruled.
and
i
have
taken
the
position
that
it
should
be
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
harrisburg
of
course
is
a
very
careful,
well
reasoned
and
thought
out
decision.
the
problem
is
that
i
think
the
court
in
the
harrisburg
at
that
time
went
a
stray
on
a
couple
of
matters.
first
of
all,
the
civil
law
had
traditionally
been
the
law
applied
in
admiralty
in
england
and
in
this
country.
the
court's
generally
got
to
the
civil
law,
now
this
is
not
to
say
that
courts
might
not
look
to
the
common
law,
but
at
that
time
swift
against
tyson
was
in
effect,
and
it
was
assumed
to
be
a
federal
uniform,
some
uniform
federal
common
law.
so
that
i
think
swift
against
tyson
had
some
effect
on
the
court.
and
of
course,
that's
been
laid
to
rest
in
1936
and
1938.
but,
in
looking
to
the
common
law,
if
a
court
in
admiralty
were
going
to
law
or
applying
maritime
law
would
go
and
look
to
the
common
law.
it
seem
to
me
the
court
would
look
in
and
find
a
doctrine
of
the
common
law,
which
was
a
progressive,
a
good
and
doctrine
that
everyone
said
this
is
wonderful
in
it's
something
that
should
be
adopted
by
the
admiralty.
but
in
this
case,
the
court
adopted
a
rule
of
the
common
law,
which
had
been
abrogated
40
years
before
by
the
english
parliament,
which
had
been
criticized
by
everybody
that
ever
said
anything
about
it,
which
everybody
agreed
was
a
terrible
rule,
the
common
law,
and
which
everybody
agrees,
they
think
it's
a
terrible
rule.
so
admiralty
went
out
from
the
civil
law
theme
to
engraft
into
maritime
law
a
rule
of
the
common
law,
which
nobody
defends.
that
is
that
there's
no
right
of
action
for
wrongful
death
absent
the
statute.
and
this
is
where
the
point
here.
mr.
charles
hardee
the
wrongful
death
act
in
florida
was
originally
thought
to
be
a
lord
campbell's
act.
mr.
charles
hardee
it's
a
statute,
yes
sir.
it's
a
lord
campbell's
type
statute.
however,
it
was
amended
in
1953
to
provide
for
actions
ex
contractu,
as
well
as
actions
ex
delicto,
which
brought
in
the
field
of
implied
warranty
of
food
stuffs
and
product
liability
and
so
on.
so,
that
is
not
a
technically
any
longer
really
a
lord
campbell's
act.
so
that
the
harrisburg
now
has
resulted
by
evolution
in
the
situation
that
we
find
ourselves
now
in
moragne
and
that
is
where
the
state
of
florida
has
effectively
abolished
the
warranty
of
sea
worthiness,
which
is
in
deeply
engrafted
in
admiralty
and
maritime
law.
so
that
a
longshoreman,
who
is
healed
as
distinguished
could
be
an
injured
on
navigable
waters
of
the
state
of
florida,
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states,
within
the
state
of
florida
is
deprived
of
this
doctrine
as
warranty
of
seaworthiness.
and
is
relegated
to
common
law
and
negligence,
which
is
very
different
type
now,
from
the
negligence
that
we
know
in
maritime
law.
i
think
that
it's
been
traditional
in
admiralty
courts,
and
the
supreme
court
in
particular
has
fashioned
admiralty
remedies
and
admiralty
law
where
necessary.
i
need
only
point
out
a
few
for
instance
in
this
case,
the
ship
owner
is
seeking
indemnity
against
the
stevedore.
the
indemnity
of
a
ship
owner
against
the
stevedore
was
fashioned
by
the
court
in
the
ryan
case
and
substantive
cases.
so,
we
have
indemnity
involved
in
this
case,
in
this
very
case,
which
is
a
court
made
or
court
fashioned
maritime
doctrine,
which
is
unknown
in
the
state
of
florida,
but
it's
going
to
be
an
issue
in
this
case,
and
yet
the
respondents
say
that
the
plaintiff,
the
petitioner
here
should
be
relegated
the
state
law,
as
far
as
her
rights
for
death
are
concerned
to
turn
on
navigable
waters.
but
they
turned
around
and
seeked
the
benefit
of
the
court
fashioned,
right
of
indemnity
against
the
stevedore,
of
course
the
duty
of
--
the
warranty
of
sea
worthiness
is
a
thing
that
has
been
fashioned
by
the
court.
and
the
impleader
rules
had
been
fashioned
by
the
court.
i'd
like
to
point
out
one
other
thing.
back
in
the
1917
to
1924,
starting
with
the
jensen
case,
the
supreme
court
held
that
a
state
law,
workmen's
compensation
law,
could
not
validly
be
applied
to
maritime
injuries
or
death
occurring
on
state
waters.
after
the
jensen's
case
the
congress
had
passed
a
statute,
which
can
be
effective
of
placing
state
workmen's
compensation
laws
over
these
injuries
and
death.
and
the
court
–
and
the
nicker
barker
case,
said
you
can't
do
that,
that's
unconstitutional.
so
then,
the
congress
came
back
and
passed
another
statute
of
the
same
title
exempting
members,
masters
and
members
of
vessels.
and
the
court
again
said,
you
cannot
constitutionally
apply
a
state
statute,
workmen's
compensation
statute,
to
injuries
or
death
occurring
on
maritime
waters.
it
seems
to
me
in
the
tungus,
that
this
court
has
done
in
maritime
deaths,
what
the
court
three
times
said
back
in
1917
and
1924
that
the
congress
could
not
constitutionally
do.
so
that
i
urge
this
court,
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may,
and
i
urge
this
court
to
receive
from
the
majority
reasoning
in
tungus
and
to
overrule
the
harrisburg.
mr.
charles
hardee
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there's
one
area
in
particular
that
i
think
we
want
to
be
certain
that
we
have
cleared
up.
as
we
understand
the
law
at
present,
a
seaman
has
a
right
or
the
heirs
of
a
dead
seaman
have
a
right
to
recover
for
negligence
within
the
territorial
waters
of
the
united
states.
and
for
negligence
and
un-seaworthiness
beyond
the
three-mile
limit,
by
virtue
of
the
jones
act
and
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
mr.
charles
hardee
right.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir,
this
court
has
never
made
a
decision
on
that,
but
gilmore
and
black
at
page
304
in
their
previous
decision.
mr.
charles
hardee
just
like
that,
new
jersey
statute
in
tungus,
if
it's
a
--
mr.
charles
hardee
act
in
neglect
or
default
i
think
is
the
exact
words
of
it
or
in
simple
language.
mr.
charles
hardee
unseaworthiness
and
the
federal
courts,
the
chairman
seaman
against
--
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir
and
under
the
death
on
a
high
seas
act,
the
seaman
have
been
allowed
to
recover
for
unseaworthiness
or
the
heirs
of
the
seaman
have
been
allowed
to
recover
for
unseaworthiness
in
a
death
act,
so
--
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir
and
--
mr.
charles
hardee
in
chermesino
against
the
vessel
judith
lee
rose,
which
was
recorded
in
the
federal
supplement
also
went
to
second
circuit
--
mr.
charles
hardee
no,
sir
cert
was
denied
in
that
case
but
this
court
has
never
written
an
opinion
on
this
question.
but
gilmore
and
black
have
said
that
all
of
the
lower
court
decisions
are
to
disaffect
and
he
assumes
that
this
court
would
withhold
that.
mr.
charles
hardee
1920,
the
same
year
mr.
justice
white
as
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
mr.
charles
hardee
i
think
as
the
government
suggested,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
was
intended
by
congress
to
fill
a
void
or
a
vacuum
--
mr.
charles
hardee
no
sir,
it
includes
everybody,
seaman
and
non-seaman
--
mr.
charles
hardee
well,
i'm
sure
it
wasn't
--
the
purpose
wasn't
to
cover
seaman
because
it
passed
the
jones
act
the
same
year.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
hardee
any
person,
that's
right.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
and
gilmore
and
black
suggested
the
lower
courts
have
held,
they're
thinking
can
recover
under
either
theory
or
both.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes,
they're
slightly
different,
they
are.
now,
what
this
brings
us
to
is
this,
that
a
seaman
does
not
have
--
or
the
heirs
of
a
dead
seaman
do
not
have
the
right
to
recover
for
unseaworthiness
within
the
territorial
waters
of
the
united
states,
by
a
reason
of
lindgren
and
gellispie.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
charles
hardee
well,
that's
right
because
the
warranty
doesn't
apply
to
--
extended
to
apply
to
a
vesture,
unless
the
failure
was
a
negligence
failure
to
find
as
in
seaworthiness,
but
--
mr.
charles
hardee
a
longshoreman
may
recover
in
all
the
states,
except
florida
that
it
decided
the
question.
both
for
negligence
and
for
unseaworthiness
in
the
territorial
waters
of
the
united
states,
so
that
a
seaman
for
whom
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness
was
originally
fashioned
in
the
aziola
has
a
left
right
by
reason
of
the
preemption
problem
that
confronted
the
court
in
lindgren
and
gellispie
that
longshoreman
have.
mr.
charles
hardee
because
he
has
no
--
he
does
not
have
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
does
not
extend
to
him
in
a
death
case
within
the
territorial
waters
of
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
hardee
well,
under
tungus,
in
new
jersey,
in
new
york.
mr.
charles
hardee
because
in
gillespie,
the
longshoreman
can
take
advantage
of
it
by
reason
of
tungus,
because
he
sues
under
the
state
death
act.
but
in
gillespie,
the
court
held
that
the
jones
act
preempted
state
act.
mr.
charles
hardee
so
that's
--
well,
this
is
what
i'm
saying,
this
is
why
a
seaman
cannot
recover
from
and/or
the
heirs
of
a
seaman
who
has
been
killed,
cannot
recover
for
unseaworthiness
within
the
territorial
waters
of
the
united
states
--
mr.
charles
hardee
within
territorial
waters
of
the
untied
states.
mr.
charles
hardee
right.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
now,
what
we're
saying
is
if
this
court
overrules
the
harrisburg,
then
the
court
of
necessity
has
in
effect
overrule
gellispie.
and
the
range
that
seaman
have
are
the
same
then
as
the
rights
of
longshoreman
have,
and
we
have
a
complete
uniformity,
as
far
as
death
cases
are
concerned.
we
were
not
sure
whether
we
made
this
clear.
mr.
charles
hardee
no
sir,
but
if
this
court
overrules
the
harrisburg,
i
assume
that
the
court
then
intends
to
find
that
there
is
in
maritime
law
a
remedy
for
wrongful
death,
aside
from
any
statute.
mr.
charles
hardee
besides
many
statute
for
whatever
the
rights
would
have
been
and
if
the
man
had
been
injured,
he
had
--
he's
heirs
have
the
same
rights
if
he's
killed.
mr.
charles
hardee
no
sir,
but
i
would
suggest
that
--
mr.
charles
hardee
but
i
would
suggest
this
that
if
the
harrisburg
were
overruled
and
this
court
decided
that
there
is
a
remedy
for
wrongful
death
in
maritime
law
aside
from
the
statute,
that
the
heirs
of
a
seaman
who's
killed
on
territorial
waters
would
have
a
right
to
the
warranty
of
--
or
to
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness
--
mr.
charles
hardee
well
in
any
event,
this
is
the
way
we
see
it.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
there
are
several
--
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir,
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
that
or
to
say
we're
going
to
generally
follow
the
federal
statutes
that
are
on
existence
and
--
mr.
charles
hardee
well,
the
jones
act
or
death
on
a
high
seas
act,
there's
not
a
great
difference
between.
mr.
charles
hardee
i
don't
--
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
charles
hardee
i
don't
really
think
that
you
need
to
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
we
can
--
actually,
as
i
mentioned
in
my
brief,
i
think
the
court
should
revert
to
the
civil
law,
which
says
that
any
person
who
suffers
damages
by
the
act
of
another,
the
other
person
is
obliged
to
repair
it.
i
think
as
you
start
restricting
damages,
then
it's
going
to
create
a
lot
of
problems.
i
just
don't
see
much
of
a
problem.
mr.
charles
hardee
i
don't
think
--
is
there
any
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
general
law
on
damages.
it
says
that
his
creditors
can
come
in
and
--
mr.
charles
hardee
that
is
always
pretty
generally
uniform
--
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
hardee
i
think
you
do
that
or
--
mr.
charles
hardee
i
just
don't
see
--
mr.
charles
hardee
i
think
it's
very
simple,
i
don't
see
the
problem.
mr.
charles
hardee
that
the
respondents
see
in
this
case
or
in
that
regard.
mr.
charles
hardee
no
sir,
not
that
i
know
of.
it
certainly
didn't.
mr.
charles
hardee
no
sir,
and
i
think
(voice
overlap),
by
reason
of
the
harrisburg,
which
--
and
i
think
is
an
amicus
of
--
the
american
trial
lawyers
pointed
out
that
this
court
is
not
just
an
anchorage,
it
also
has
a
sale,
and
if
you
make
that
law,
you
can
also
repeal
it,
same
bad
law.
there's
one
other
thing
i
wanted
to
mention,
and
that
is
a
statement
made
by
the
respondents,
mrs.
moragne
has
identical
right,
under
the
florida
wrongful
death
statute
as
presently
decided
by
the
florida
supreme
court,
as
a
seaman
had.
now,
this
just
is
not
so,
in
fact
if
florida
common
law
negligence
walked
down
the
street
and
passed
jones
act
negligence,
they
wouldn't
recognize
each
other.
there's
absolutely
no
kinship
at
all
between
the
two.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
hardee
yes
sir,
negligence
of
fellow
seaman,
assumption
to
risk,
all
of
those
things
go
with
the
florida.
