justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
i
ask
you,
after
removal
when
as
the
case
proceeded,
was
a
claim
asserted
whether
formally
or
informally
under
the
admiralty
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
your
claim
that
the
admiralty
law
would
require
a
state
to
have
its
wrongful
death
statute
in
corporate
maritime
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
the
--
is
that
a
question
about
the
harrisburg?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
can't
--
if
that's
your
only
claim,
you
never
will
get
to
the
harrisburg,
will
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
didalter
it,
they
did
alter
it
for
--
justice
byron
r.
white
non
seaman
in
the
states
territory
less
than
marine
league
from
the
shores.
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
they
retain
statement
under
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
be
your
suggestion
that
the
government
suggestion
that
we
just
overrule
the
harrisburg
and
then
spell
out
on
a
case
by
case
basis,
the
essential
elements
of
this
action
for
wrongful
death?
who
can
sue
statute
limitations
and
all
the
other
caught
in
the
trappings?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
(voice
overlap)
case
to
case
basis
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
of
beneficiaries?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
a
death
on
high
seas
act
do
as
to
beneficiaries?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
he's
got
--
because
the
right
of
action
exclusively
under
the
jones
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
something
the
seaman
doesn't
have
for
death?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
high
seas.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
the
jones
act
passed?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
why
did
they
needed
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
non-seaman.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
why
did
they
needed
to
cover
seaman?
why
do
they
need
two
for
seaman?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
guess
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
used
the
word
person.
justice
byron
r.
white
any
person.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
apply
the
--
if
you
apply
the
death
on
high
seas
act,
seaman
where
they
certainly
don't
have
--
they
certainly
can
recover
one
of
–-
the
standard
for
recovery
will
be
different
than
in
the
negligence
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
both.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
does
it
apply
to
a
longshoreman?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
but
why
can't
the
seaman
take
advantage
of
the
same
thing
that
longshoreman
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
we're
not
talking
about
the
jones
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it's
an
exclusive
remedy
for
the
seaman
per
day,
it's
a
jones
act,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
within
territorial
waters
--
the
jones
act
and
that
talks
about
the
negligence
action
at
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
exclusive.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
territorial
waters.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
wouldn't
think
that
overruling
the
harrisburg
would
overrule
this
court's
construction
of
the
jones
act,
which
was
set
to
--
intended
to
made
an
exclusive
remedy
for
death.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
unseaworthiness.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
yes,
but
if
the
harrisburg
is
overruled,
would
you
suggest
that
the
seaman
on
the
high
seas
has
any
other
remedy
other
than
either
a
jones
act
or
a
death
on
the
high
seas
act
remedy?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
it
isn't
--
whether
the
legislature
is
regulated,
created
and
regulated,
the
death
remedy,
i
suppose
that
would
be
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
if
the
congress
intended
by
the
jones
act
to
make
the
remedy
of
the
seaman
--
given
if
the
seaman
exclusive
of
all
of
the
remedies.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
his
creditors?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
would
be
--
perhaps
we
would
be
fashioning
the
law
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
didn't
have
to
that,
i
think
it's
mcallister,
i
forgot
the
name
of
it,
i
guess
that's
the
name.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
did
precisely
this,
when
we
had
a
void,
we
had
to
fill
it,
and
we
found
an
answer
by
analogy
in
other
federal
statutes.
