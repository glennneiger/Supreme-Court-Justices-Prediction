mr.
solomon
h.
friend
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
addressing
myself
to
the
two
basic
arguments
of
the
solicitor,
i'd
like
to
take
just
a
moment
to
highlight
certain
critical
salient
facts
which
i
think
were
minimized
by
the
solicitor's
presentation,
which
support
our
contention
that
there
here
is
involved
an
extraordinary
example
of
unfair
inquisitorial
authority
exercised
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
in
a
manner
which
we
contend
is
adherence
to
civilized
procedures
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
your
honor,
yes
i
do.
i
would
rely
upon
the
mcnab
doctrine
that
this
court
and
the
federal
courts
have
supervision
over
the
fair
administration
of
criminal
justice
which
as
i
understand
the
government's
argument
rises
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
right
of
due
process.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
they
decided
--
it
would
appear
that
they
decided
that
the
question
on
two
grounds.
one
of
which
they
articulated
out,
i
believe
more
specifically
than
the
second
ground
and
the
solicitor
apparently
agrees
with
that.
firstly,
on
the
fifth
amendment
and
secondly,
because
of
some
of
the
cases
which
they
cited
in
their
statement
of
the
--
of
what
actually
had
occurred
in
the
complete
and
total
co-mingling
of
the
civil
function
and
criminal
investigation
by
the
same
individual
at
the
same
time.
that
that
somehow
moved
the
court
to
rely
upon
certain
cases
which
they
did
rely
upon
to
support
the
element
decision
that
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
both
--
both
your
honor.
both,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
i
would
say
it's
a
violative
of
constitutional
due
process
and
also
comes
within
the
authority
of
this
court
to
supervise
with
fair
administration
of
criminal
justice
other
than
mcnab
rule.
now
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
i
think
your
honor
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
at
that
point,
they
would
have
been
a
choice
which
they
could
make.
if
they
had
testified,
they
would
have
been
deemed
to
have
waived
their
privilege.
in
the
instant
case,
they
sought
relief
in
the
form
of
a
protective
order
and
then
were
ordered,
that
is
to
say
as
they
would
argue
the
corporation
which
happens
to
be
the
same
two
individuals,
the
corporation
was
ordered
to
answer
the
questions
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
mr.
chief
justice,
in
all
of
the
cases
that
i've
found
on
this,
what
has
happened
in
the
usual
case
and
in
almost
every
case
is
that
the
civil
court
will
stay
the
trial
of
that
case
pending
the
outcome
of
the
criminal
case
if
in
fact
the
criminal
case
is
either
pending
or
eminent.
now
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
there
are
cases
would
say
that
if
it's
neither,
if
the
government
does
not
have
under
contemplation
of
bringing
of
a
criminal
case,
then
there
are
cases
which
say
that
while
the
defendant
must
answer
the
question
the
civil
case
in
the
interests
of
fairness
and
to
avoid
abuse,
the
government
may
not
use
those
answers
in
the
criminal
case.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
no.
no,
mr.
justice
white.
the
cases
go
on
the
broader
theory
that
it
is
inherently
unfair
for
either
the
defendant
in
a
civil
case
to
try
and
get
the
government's
evidence
by
use
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
where
there
is
a
threatened
criminal
case
or
a
pending
criminal
case.
and
for
the
government
to
interpose,
propose
interrogatories
to
the
defendant
to
try
to
get
the
defendant's
defense
or
evidence
which
will
support
the
prosecution.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
cases
cited
on
our
brief,
in
our
brief,
under
the
anti
trust
laws
and
as
well
as
under
the
internal
revenue
service
laws,
the
case
united
states
against
linen
supply
institute
of
greater
new
york,
the
government
had
moved
to
extend
its
time
and
sought
a
protective
order,
just
as
we
did,
from
being
required
to
answer
interrogatories
which
had
been
propounded
to
it
by
the
defendant
in
the
civil
case
and
argued
the
very
the
same
argument
which
we
make,
at
least
one
of
the
arguments
which
we
make
here,
namely
that
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
should
not
be
used
by
either
side,
where
there
is
a
criminal
case
pending,
so
as
to
draw
from
the
use
of
the
federal
rules
information
which
they
would
not
be
entitled
to
under
the
criminal
rules.
now,
we
don't
say
and
nor
did
the
court
find,
in
fact
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
held
that
the
government
may
bring
a
civil
and
a
criminal
case
simultaneously
if
the
statute
so
provides.
but
as
we
read
the
court
of
appeals'
holding,
they
are
saying
that
the
strike
a
fair
bounce
between
the
need
of
the
government
to
obtain
answers
to
interrogatories
to
pursue
its
remedies
civilly,
while
that
would
be
sufficient.
they
could
use
the
answers
in
a
civil
case.
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
use
those
answers
in
the
criminal
case.
they
may
bring
their
criminal
case
but
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
use
those
answers
because
then
we
have
a
virtually
uncontrolled
situation
where
both
sides,
where
there
is
a--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
that
would
be
opposition
mr.
justice
brennan.
now,
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
our
position
would
be
that
if
the
government
had
at
that
time
a
pending
criminal
proceeding,
they
should
not
seek
to
elicit
through
the
use
of
interrogatories
in
a
case
which
is
identical
to
the
criminal
case.
mr.
justice
white,
the
case,
the
civil
case
was
identical
with
the
counts
in
the
criminal
case
and
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
well,
i
would
agree
with
your
honor
that
they
could
under
the
white
case
and
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
well,
i
most
respectfully
disagree
with
that
suggestion
mr.
justice
white
because
even
the
district
court
felt
and
the
court
of
appeals
made
express
findings
with
respect
to
this
point
that
what
they
sought
was
not
corporate
documents,
but
what
they
sought
was
admissions
concerning
activities
of
kordel.
now
as
your
honor
we'll
recall
the
solicitor
made
the
point
that
the
acts
which
misbranded
these
drugs
were
books
which
have
been
writing
by
kordel,
lectures
which
he
had
given.
there
wasn't
anything
intrinsically
wrong
with
the
label
itself.
the
drug
was
not
adulterated.
there
was
not
a
non-safe
or
poisonous
substance
being
sold
and
what
they
did
is
that
they
choose
the
pierce
the
corporate
veil
themselves
by
the
interrogatories
which
they
answered.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
the
other
defendant
in
this
case,
mr.
feldten.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
kordel
--
kordel
did
not
sign
the
interrogatories
but
the
court
of
appeals
says,
that
he
undoubtedly
and
definitely
participated
in
the
decision
to
answer
the
questions
which
they
were
required
to
do
after
the
court
have
order
them
to
answer
the
question.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
mr.
justice
black,
when
the
motion
for
protective
order
was
made
before
the
district
court
in
a
civil
case,
while
they
did
not
plea
the
fifth
amendment,
the
motion
for
the
protective
order
clearly
spelled
out
the
dilemma
which
confronted
the
two
officers
of
the
corporation.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
that
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
they
did
not
claim
the
fifth
amendment.
they
claimed
that
evidence
to
be
given
in
the
case.
he
did
not
spell
out
the
fifth
amendment
in
those
terms.
they
said
however,
that
incriminating
information
would
be
revealed.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
well,
i
would
say
they
did
not
claim
it
in
the
technical
sense,
but
i
would
not
suggest
that
constituted
a
waive
of
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
yes.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
yes.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
they
didn't
claim
specifically,
but
their
failure
to
have
claimed
that
in
my
judgment
would
not
be
deemed
the
waiver
because
of
the
form
in
which
they
did
ask
to
be
excused
from
answering
the
questions.
now,
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
i
would
not
make
that
argument
under
those
facts
your
honor
and
i
do
not
believe
that
that
would
--
those
facts
would
have
moved
the
court
of
appeals
to
reverse.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
believe
a
pursuit
of
the
motive
or
the
good
faith
or
the
lack
of
good
faith
is
a
fruitful
inquiry
for
this
reason.
in
every
case,
where
there
was
a
criminal
case
pending
or
threatened
that's
parallel
to
a
civil
case.
it
can
always
be
argued
by
the
government
that
at
least
one
of
the
motives
in
serving
the
interrogatories
is
to
lay
the
ground
work
for
summary
judgment
or
narrow
the
issues
and
indeed,
the
filing
of
a
civil
case
under
the
food
and
drug
law
is
a
relatively
simple
and
common
place
function.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
happened
in
this
case
is
after
they
filed
the
civil
case,
they
did
nothing
to
protect
the
public
interest
either
by
an
injunction
and
of
course
if
they
had
all
the
evidence
anyway
which
they
say
had
to
bring
a
criminal
case,
they
most
certainly
could
have
moved
in
with
the
temporary
restraining
order
to
restrain
shipments
which
would
have
dried
up
the
source
of
materials
they
wouldn't
have
to
make
multiple
seizures.
secondly,
they
never
made
multiple
seizures.
the
case
was
settled
by
a
consent
decree
containing
exculpatory
clause
in
which
they
admit
it
that
nothing
within
the
--
within
that
civil
case
would
be
deemed
as
an
admission
against
defendants
that
they
violated
the
law,
and
then
by
using
the
interrogatory,
the
answers
to
the
interrogatories,
i'd
like
to
talk
about
that
for
a
moment,
by
using
the
interrogatories,
they
accomplished
exactly
that
which
they
said
would
not
be
implied
by
the
end
of
the
year
of
the
consent
decree
namely
the
admission
of
guilt
or
evidence
or
leads
to/from
evidence
concerning
guilt.
now,
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
your
honor,
the
corporation
was
a
defendant
in
both
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
sir,
i
would
not
make
the
argument
on
fifth
amendment
grounds
but
i
would
make
the
argument
on
the
mcnab
or
under
reasonable
and
fair
administrative
procedures
indeed
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
and
under
rules.
i
think
its
rule
41
(b)
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
the
court
of
appeals
--
i
do
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
have
a
petition
for
rehearing
of
that
denial
the
petition
for
certiorari
as
to
the
corporation
which
was
filed
in
june
and
which
is
still
pending
before
the
court.
and
one
of
the
arguments
we
made
in
the
petition
rehearing
is,
that
if
we're
right
on
this
other
point
of
unfairness,
that
is
to
say
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
sustained
on
grounds
broader
perhaps
than
what
they
specifically
articulated,
then
that
would
justify
a
reversal
of
the
court
of
appeals'
affirmance
with
respect
to
the
corporation
and
i
suspect
that
perhaps,
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
our
motion
petition
for
rehearing
is
still
pending
because
there
is
a
relationship
between
the
two
cases.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
yes.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
well,
i
don't
know
mr.
justice
black,
if
i
could
slaughter
into
anyone
of
those
categories,
but
i
think
i
would
rely
upon
the
principle
that
was
stated
in
us
against
boyd,
that
no
court
should
decree
a
discovery
which
will
tend
to
convict
a
person
or
corporation
of
a
crime.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
but
mr.
justice
brennan,
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
as
i
read
boyd,
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
holding
of
boyd
or
the
language
in
boyd
is
somewhat
broader
than
the
fourth
or
fifth
amendment.
indeed,
it
goes
to
the
point
that
there's
even
a
possible
fourth
amendment
violation.
it's
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
and
the
district
court
and
i
know
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
mr.
chief
justice,
the
case
did
deal
with
private
papers.
but
there
is
language
in
the
boyd
case
which
the
district
judge
in
our
case,
who
ruled
against
the
us
on
this
motion
to
suppress
by
the
way,
felt,
suggests
that
the
boyd
holding
is
broader
than
a
fifth
amendment
or
private
papers
in
that,
it's
basically
unfair.
it's
violative
of
the
public
policy
which
is
rooted,
this
is
their
language,
rooted
in
historical
and
several
concepts
of
anglo-saxon
criminal
jurisprudence
that
a
defendant
or
a
prospective
defendant
should
not
be
required
to
disclose
evidence
to
sustain
the
prosecution
against
them
in
a
criminal
case
or
his
evidence
of
defense
and
in
the
fair
case
and
in
any
number
of
cases,
they
make
the
point
that
this
is
not
a
manner
of
fifth
amendment.
it's
broader
than
the
possible
violation
of
a
privilege
of
self-incrimination
and
that
the
issue
is
also
whether
the
methods
employed
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
--
whether
the
methods
employed
in
obtaining
such
an
information
show
such
unfairness
that
the
evidence
should
be
inadmissible
apart
from
fifth
amendment
consideration.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
well,
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
the
standard
here
would
be
when
one
views
the
facts.
no
different
from
what
the
standard
was
in
the
mcnab
case
or
in
the
reid
case.
what
happen
here,
i
think
this
should
be
stressed,
is
that
the
interrogatories
were
prepared
by
mr.
josh
randolph
of
the
food
and
drug
administration
at
the
same
time
that
he
prepared
a
notice,
notifying
the
defendants,
all
of
the
defendants
including
the
corporation
that
their
investigation
revealed
defendants'
responsibility
for
criminal
violations
of
the
act.
now
this
notice
said,
just
that
it,
it
didn't
say
we
have
it
under
considerations.
it
says,
our
investigation,
this
is
on
page
105
in
our
appendix
in
the
brief,
investigation
by
this
administration
indicates
your
responsibility
for
violation
of
the
act,
and
then
they
spell
out
the
violation.
now,
the
same
individual
who
was
investigating
and
this
was
mr.
randolph's
testimony,
he
was
in
charge
of
the
investigation
the
criminal
case
and
he
was
in
charge
of
preparing
the
interrogatories
in
a
civil
case.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
the
notice
was
sent
out
on
december
29.
there
were
received
on
january
the
15h,
the
interrogatories
were
received
on
january
the
9th.
they
were
virtually
simultaneous.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
no,
sir.
no,
mister
--
the
interrogatories
were
answered
in
september,
but
because
the
motion
had
been
made
in
the
meantime
to
stay
the
answering
of
these
interrogatories.
but
what
happened
was,
when
he
got
the
answers,
he
then
made
a
recommendation,
his
second
recommendation
to
indict
that
the
defendants
be
indicted
and
to
refer
the
matter
to
the
department
of
justice,
this
within
a
matter
of
a
week
or
two
and
as
the
record
shows
in
discussing
the
matter
with
the
food
and
drug
administration
official
in
detroit,
mr.
randolph
being
in
washington,
he
made
it
a
point
of
telling
the
fda
official
in
detroit
who
was
handling
the
civil
case
on
the
local
scene
to
be
sure
to
send
him
the
answers
to
the
interrogatories.
and
when
he
said
he
would,
and
did,
he
then
called
mr.
fowler
in
detroit
and
told
mr.
fowler
the
he'd
liked
the
send
out
another
notice
of
criminal
violation
which
is
the
fourth
notice
which
they
sent
out,
which
now
broadened
the
first
three,
they
actually
sent
three
out
almost
at
the
same
time
but
the
fourth
one
was
sent
out
after
they've
had
the
answers
and
a
second
recommendation
was
made
to
indict
these
defendants.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
i
would
answer
mr.
justice
black
this
way
that
the
standard
is
a
standard
which
depends
upon
the
facts
in
any
given
case.
i'm
not
asking
this
court
nor
the
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
i
would
say,
it's
a
standard
of
fairness
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
and
i
was
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
i
would
say
the
court
should
decide
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
whether
under
our
form
of
free
government,
whether
drawing
upon
the
concepts
of
criminal
jurisprudence
which
have
come
to
us
through
the
ages,
whether
it
is
inherently
unfair
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
through
the
ages,
yes
sir.
mr.
justice.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
well,
the
boyd
case
which
is
still
as
vital
as
it
was
in
the
19
century
seems
to
require
that
the
courts
to
decide
these
--
some
of
these
cases
on
the
mcnab
case
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
the
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
well,
i
think
the
narrow
--
the
technical
holding
of
boyd
was
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
fourth
amendment
as
i
read
the
case
mr.
justice
black
and
the
district
court
here
apparently
felt
that
it's
even
broader
than
that.
in
that
there
is
something
unfair
in
requiring
a
defendant
in
a
civil
case
to
and
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
what
is
unfair
about
it
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
--
mr.
justice
black
is
that
where
there
is
a
civil
case,
he
is
faced
with
what
i
would
call
a
cruel
trilemma,
either
a
cruel
trilemma,
he
must
either
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
trilemma
and
the
court
of
appeals
made
this
point,
he
is
then
confronted
with
three
alternatives.
he
can
answer
the
questions
and
lie
in
which
event
he
can
be
guilty
of
perjury.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
that
is
true,
but
that's
one
of
the
alternatives
which
he
shouldn't
be
required
to
select.
the
second
one
is
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
well,
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
well,
he
could
claim
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
i
think
the
problem
mr.
justice
black
here
is
that
the
government
is
arguing
a
very
technical
and
very
mechanical
interpretation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
that
is
a
different
question,
but
it's
related
to
the
question
which
your
honor
asks
for
this
reason.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
well,
mcnab
was
not
decided
on
any
constitutional
provision
as
i
recall
the
mcnab
case.
it
was
decided
on
the
basis
that
it
was
inherently
unfair
for
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
well,
[attempt
to
laughter]
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart.
there
are
rules
as
i
now
i
understand
the
point
there
are
rules
in
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
which
allows
certain
forms
of
discovery.
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
i
would
say
that
the
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
which
incorporates
the
mcnab
rule,
i
believe,
its
41
(b)
into
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
the
rule
i'm
referring
to
has
the
effect
mr.
justice
black
as
i
read
the
rule
of
granting
the
court
authority
to
supervise
the
fair
administration
of
criminal
justice
and
the
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
i
believe
it's
41
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
your
honors,
may
i
point
out
in
that
connection
of
fairness
that
in
the
instant
case,
an
official
of
the
food
and
drug
administration
testified,
that
it
was
the
routine
practice
over
the
past
38
years
for
the
food
and
drug
administration
to
file
interrogatories
and
then
take
the
answers
to
those
interrogatories
and
use
them
in
the
criminal
case
at
the
very
time
that
the
court,
the
fda
was
considering
a
criminal
case
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
that's
--
that's
a
protection.
now,
they
seek
to
deny
us
this
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
except
mr.
chief
justice
that
in
this
case,
they
would
deny
us
that
protection
because
they
say,
technically
the
interrogatories
were
directed
to
the
corporation
which
doesn't
enjoy
the
privilege,
and
we
say,
and
the
court
held
below
that
kordel
was
the
dominant
personality,
the
corporation
was
merely
a
device,
an
instrumentality
through
which
he
sold
his
products,
that
the
interrogatories
would
directed
in
his
activities
and
that
since
they
choose
to
get
this
information
about
him
by
asking
a
corporation
the
questions
in
effect
since
they
have
breeched
the
corporate
veil
and
the
questions
that
they
asked,
they
shouldn't
be
permitted
to
repair
that
breech
to
deny
kordel
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
that
was
i
believe
your
honor
asked
me
that
question
before
and
he
did
not
assert
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
he
did
not
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
he
did
not
assert
it
but
i
think
a
more
complete
answer
your
honor
would
be
that
he
did
not
waive
it
either
because
of
the
motion
that
was
made
at
the
time
to
excuse
him
from
being
or
excuse
the
corporation
from
being
required
to
answered
the
question.
now,
what
they
say
kordel
should
have
done?
they
admit
kordel
and
feldten
had
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
they
didn't
have
to
answer,
but
they
say
and
this
is
the
crux
of
their
case,
they
say
that
the
corporation
should
have
appointed
a
third
party,
some
agent,
to
answer
the
questions
and
in
effect
what
they're
saying
is,
of
course
the
corporation
could
only
act
through
a
human
being,
they're
saying
that
kordel,
who
would
himself
had
a
privilege
not
to
answer,
should
have
appointed
that
an
agent
and
then
supplied
him
with
the
information
to
answer
the
questions
which
he
himself
would
have
been
privileged
to
withhold.
and
they
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
there
is
an
agent
available,
why
is
the
corporations'
attorney,
who
happens
to
be
me,
that
what
i
should
do
is
sign
the
answers
to
the
--
sign
the
answers
to
the
interrogatories
in
behalf
of
the
corporation.
but
the
only
way
that
i
could
get
the
information
available
to
the
corporation
is
by
asking
my
client,
mr.
kordel,
the
president
of
the
corporation
as
to
whom
they
sought
admissions.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
yes,
i
was
your
honor.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
i
advised
him
at
that
time
your
honor
and
we
did
file
a
motion
to
be
excused
from
answering
the
questions
temporarily,
pending
the
outcome
of
the
criminal
case
and
when
the
judge,
it
was
judge
levin
of
the
district
court,
heard
the
argument,
the
government
represented
to
the
court
and
this
is
in
the
record,
that
there
was
no
certainty
when
or
if
or
whether
or
if
there
would
ever
be
a
criminal
case
so
the
court
said.
well
at
this
point,
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
well,
i
admired
that
in
this
case
mr.
justice
black.
but
what
happened
is,
of
course,
there
might
never
be
a
case
if
the
answers
to
the
interrogatories
didn't
reveal
evidence
to
support
their
position,
but
if
they
had
a
case,
they
should
have
brought
it.
they
didn't
need
the
admissions
either
to
lay
the
basis
for
summary
judgment
or
to
press
forth
on
the
case
before
it
because
is
--
if
they
have
all
these
evidence,
they
can
go
back
and
retry
the
case
without
too
much
difficulty.
thank
you.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
yes
sir.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
the
court
of
appeals
answered
that
question
and
i'd
like
to
refer
to
the
court
to
not
only
with
the
court
of
appeals
said
but
the
actual
transcript.
on
page
142
and
143,
i
asked
the
question
of
the
witness
as
to
whether
they
anticipated
difficulty
in
proving
interstate
commerce
with
respect
to
the
principle
product
known
as
“korleen”
and
the
answer
was
that
they
had
difficulty
proving
interstate
commerce
with
respect
to
korleen
manufactured
by
a
different
manufacturer.
but
with
respect
to
the
manufacturer
that
was
involved
in
this
case,
they
wouldn't
have
such
difficulty
because
they
have
the
answers
to
the
interrogatories.
secondly,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
these
answers
to
the
interrogatories,
which
they
say
was
not
necessary
to
get
the
indictment,
was
brought
into
the
grand
jury
room
as
part
of
one
file
which
they
had
--
to
which
they
had
put
both
the
civil
and
the
criminal
aspects
and
the
results
of
their
investigation,
that
appears
on
page
192
and
193
where
i
asked
the
witness,
and
isn't
true
that
you
used
to
assists
you
in
your
testimony
with
the
grand
jury
almost
all
the
papers
that
were
in
that
one
file
which
had
combined
the
civil
and
the
criminal
case?
answer:
i
reviewed
the
entire
file
before
i
went
before
the
grand
jury,
yes,
sir.
i
had
it
with
me
and
i
used
it
in
preparing
for
the
grand
jury,
yes
sir.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
that
was
for
the
indictment.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
that
the
interstate
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
that
was
prior
to
the
trial
but
with
respect
to
the
interstate
commerce.
when
we
identified
the
manufacturer
of
the
korleen,
that
evidence
was
introduced
into
the
trial
not
on
the
form
of
answer
to
the
interrogatory,
that's
true,
but
the
information
which
they
believe
and
the
final
answer
is,
in
the
court
of
appeals
make
straights
laid
great
stress
on
this,
it
had
been
the
practice
of
the
fda
for
38
years,
a
practice
by
the
way
which
is
received
a
great
deal
of
criticism
in
the
administrative
law
review
journal
and
other
members
of
a
food
and
drug
bar,
a
practice
whereby
they
bring
a
relatively
simple
procedure
to
follow
a
civil
case,
do
nothing
to
protect
the
public
either
by
summary
judgment,
multiple
seizures
or
what
have
you.
and
then,
put
everything
in
a
one
case
into
one
file
and
indict
it
first
and
that's
what
happened
here
and
as
the
rights
would
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
corporation
under
these
circumstances
as
well
as
the
individual
because
it's
inherently
unfair
and
uphold
to
the
form
of
criminal
procedure
which
we
would
like
to
see
in
our
land
to
allow
the
government
to
use
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
i
believe
i
got
that
from
mr.
justice
black,
from
a
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
abel
case,
us
against
abel,
and
the
--
i
feel
very
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
it's
a
related
problem
in
that
--
the
court
there
was
dealing
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
as
i
recall
that
case
sir.
that
case
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
i
believe
you
did.
i
thank
you
very
much
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
addressing
myself
to
the
two
basic
arguments
of
the
solicitor,
i'd
like
to
take
just
a
moment
to
highlight
certain
critical
salient
facts
which
i
think
were
minimized
by
the
solicitor's
presentation,
which
support
our
contention
that
there
here
is
involved
an
extraordinary
example
of
unfair
inquisitorial
authority
exercised
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
in
a
manner
which
we
contend
is
adherence
to
civilized
procedures
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
your
honor,
yes
i
do.
i
would
rely
upon
the
mcnab
doctrine
that
this
court
and
the
federal
courts
have
supervision
over
the
fair
administration
of
criminal
justice
which
as
i
understand
the
government's
argument
rises
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
right
of
due
process.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
they
decided
--
it
would
appear
that
they
decided
that
the
question
on
two
grounds.
one
of
which
they
articulated
out,
i
believe
more
specifically
than
the
second
ground
and
the
solicitor
apparently
agrees
with
that.
firstly,
on
the
fifth
amendment
and
secondly,
because
of
some
of
the
cases
which
they
cited
in
their
statement
of
the
--
of
what
actually
had
occurred
in
the
complete
and
total
co-mingling
of
the
civil
function
and
criminal
investigation
by
the
same
individual
at
the
same
time.
that
that
somehow
moved
the
court
to
rely
upon
certain
cases
which
they
did
rely
upon
to
support
the
element
decision
that
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
both
--
both
your
honor.
both,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
i
would
say
it's
a
violative
of
constitutional
due
process
and
also
comes
within
the
authority
of
this
court
to
supervise
with
fair
administration
of
criminal
justice
other
than
mcnab
rule.
now
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
i
think
your
honor
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
at
that
point,
they
would
have
been
a
choice
which
they
could
make.
if
they
had
testified,
they
would
have
been
deemed
to
have
waived
their
privilege.
in
the
instant
case,
they
sought
relief
in
the
form
of
a
protective
order
and
then
were
ordered,
that
is
to
say
as
they
would
argue
the
corporation
which
happens
to
be
the
same
two
individuals,
the
corporation
was
ordered
to
answer
the
questions
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
mr.
chief
justice,
in
all
of
the
cases
that
i've
found
on
this,
what
has
happened
in
the
usual
case
and
in
almost
every
case
is
that
the
civil
court
will
stay
the
trial
of
that
case
pending
the
outcome
of
the
criminal
case
if
in
fact
the
criminal
case
is
either
pending
or
eminent.
now
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
there
are
cases
would
say
that
if
it's
neither,
if
the
government
does
not
have
under
contemplation
of
bringing
of
a
criminal
case,
then
there
are
cases
which
say
that
while
the
defendant
must
answer
the
question
the
civil
case
in
the
interests
of
fairness
and
to
avoid
abuse,
the
government
may
not
use
those
answers
in
the
criminal
case.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
no.
no,
mr.
justice
white.
the
cases
go
on
the
broader
theory
that
it
is
inherently
unfair
for
either
the
defendant
in
a
civil
case
to
try
and
get
the
government's
evidence
by
use
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
where
there
is
a
threatened
criminal
case
or
a
pending
criminal
case.
and
for
the
government
to
interpose,
propose
interrogatories
to
the
defendant
to
try
to
get
the
defendant's
defense
or
evidence
which
will
support
the
prosecution.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
cases
cited
on
our
brief,
in
our
brief,
under
the
anti
trust
laws
and
as
well
as
under
the
internal
revenue
service
laws,
the
case
united
states
against
linen
supply
institute
of
greater
new
york,
the
government
had
moved
to
extend
its
time
and
sought
a
protective
order,
just
as
we
did,
from
being
required
to
answer
interrogatories
which
had
been
propounded
to
it
by
the
defendant
in
the
civil
case
and
argued
the
very
the
same
argument
which
we
make,
at
least
one
of
the
arguments
which
we
make
here,
namely
that
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
should
not
be
used
by
either
side,
where
there
is
a
criminal
case
pending,
so
as
to
draw
from
the
use
of
the
federal
rules
information
which
they
would
not
be
entitled
to
under
the
criminal
rules.
now,
we
don't
say
and
nor
did
the
court
find,
in
fact
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
held
that
the
government
may
bring
a
civil
and
a
criminal
case
simultaneously
if
the
statute
so
provides.
but
as
we
read
the
court
of
appeals'
holding,
they
are
saying
that
the
strike
a
fair
bounce
between
the
need
of
the
government
to
obtain
answers
to
interrogatories
to
pursue
its
remedies
civilly,
while
that
would
be
sufficient.
they
could
use
the
answers
in
a
civil
case.
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
use
those
answers
in
the
criminal
case.
they
may
bring
their
criminal
case
but
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
use
those
answers
because
then
we
have
a
virtually
uncontrolled
situation
where
both
sides,
where
there
is
a--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
that
would
be
opposition
mr.
justice
brennan.
now,
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
our
position
would
be
that
if
the
government
had
at
that
time
a
pending
criminal
proceeding,
they
should
not
seek
to
elicit
through
the
use
of
interrogatories
in
a
case
which
is
identical
to
the
criminal
case.
mr.
justice
white,
the
case,
the
civil
case
was
identical
with
the
counts
in
the
criminal
case
and
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
well,
i
would
agree
with
your
honor
that
they
could
under
the
white
case
and
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
well,
i
most
respectfully
disagree
with
that
suggestion
mr.
justice
white
because
even
the
district
court
felt
and
the
court
of
appeals
made
express
findings
with
respect
to
this
point
that
what
they
sought
was
not
corporate
documents,
but
what
they
sought
was
admissions
concerning
activities
of
kordel.
now
as
your
honor
we'll
recall
the
solicitor
made
the
point
that
the
acts
which
misbranded
these
drugs
were
books
which
have
been
writing
by
kordel,
lectures
which
he
had
given.
there
wasn't
anything
intrinsically
wrong
with
the
label
itself.
the
drug
was
not
adulterated.
there
was
not
a
non-safe
or
poisonous
substance
being
sold
and
what
they
did
is
that
they
choose
the
pierce
the
corporate
veil
themselves
by
the
interrogatories
which
they
answered.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
the
other
defendant
in
this
case,
mr.
feldten.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
kordel
--
kordel
did
not
sign
the
interrogatories
but
the
court
of
appeals
says,
that
he
undoubtedly
and
definitely
participated
in
the
decision
to
answer
the
questions
which
they
were
required
to
do
after
the
court
have
order
them
to
answer
the
question.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
mr.
justice
black,
when
the
motion
for
protective
order
was
made
before
the
district
court
in
a
civil
case,
while
they
did
not
plea
the
fifth
amendment,
the
motion
for
the
protective
order
clearly
spelled
out
the
dilemma
which
confronted
the
two
officers
of
the
corporation.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
that
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
they
did
not
claim
the
fifth
amendment.
they
claimed
that
evidence
to
be
given
in
the
case.
he
did
not
spell
out
the
fifth
amendment
in
those
terms.
they
said
however,
that
incriminating
information
would
be
revealed.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
well,
i
would
say
they
did
not
claim
it
in
the
technical
sense,
but
i
would
not
suggest
that
constituted
a
waive
of
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
yes.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
yes.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
they
didn't
claim
specifically,
but
their
failure
to
have
claimed
that
in
my
judgment
would
not
be
deemed
the
waiver
because
of
the
form
in
which
they
did
ask
to
be
excused
from
answering
the
questions.
now,
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
i
would
not
make
that
argument
under
those
facts
your
honor
and
i
do
not
believe
that
that
would
--
those
facts
would
have
moved
the
court
of
appeals
to
reverse.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
believe
a
pursuit
of
the
motive
or
the
good
faith
or
the
lack
of
good
faith
is
a
fruitful
inquiry
for
this
reason.
in
every
case,
where
there
was
a
criminal
case
pending
or
threatened
that's
parallel
to
a
civil
case.
it
can
always
be
argued
by
the
government
that
at
least
one
of
the
motives
in
serving
the
interrogatories
is
to
lay
the
ground
work
for
summary
judgment
or
narrow
the
issues
and
indeed,
the
filing
of
a
civil
case
under
the
food
and
drug
law
is
a
relatively
simple
and
common
place
function.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
happened
in
this
case
is
after
they
filed
the
civil
case,
they
did
nothing
to
protect
the
public
interest
either
by
an
injunction
and
of
course
if
they
had
all
the
evidence
anyway
which
they
say
had
to
bring
a
criminal
case,
they
most
certainly
could
have
moved
in
with
the
temporary
restraining
order
to
restrain
shipments
which
would
have
dried
up
the
source
of
materials
they
wouldn't
have
to
make
multiple
seizures.
secondly,
they
never
made
multiple
seizures.
the
case
was
settled
by
a
consent
decree
containing
exculpatory
clause
in
which
they
admit
it
that
nothing
within
the
--
within
that
civil
case
would
be
deemed
as
an
admission
against
defendants
that
they
violated
the
law,
and
then
by
using
the
interrogatory,
the
answers
to
the
interrogatories,
i'd
like
to
talk
about
that
for
a
moment,
by
using
the
interrogatories,
they
accomplished
exactly
that
which
they
said
would
not
be
implied
by
the
end
of
the
year
of
the
consent
decree
namely
the
admission
of
guilt
or
evidence
or
leads
to/from
evidence
concerning
guilt.
now,
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
your
honor,
the
corporation
was
a
defendant
in
both
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
sir,
i
would
not
make
the
argument
on
fifth
amendment
grounds
but
i
would
make
the
argument
on
the
mcnab
or
under
reasonable
and
fair
administrative
procedures
indeed
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
and
under
rules.
i
think
its
rule
41
(b)
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
the
court
of
appeals
--
i
do
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
have
a
petition
for
rehearing
of
that
denial
the
petition
for
certiorari
as
to
the
corporation
which
was
filed
in
june
and
which
is
still
pending
before
the
court.
and
one
of
the
arguments
we
made
in
the
petition
rehearing
is,
that
if
we're
right
on
this
other
point
of
unfairness,
that
is
to
say
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
sustained
on
grounds
broader
perhaps
than
what
they
specifically
articulated,
then
that
would
justify
a
reversal
of
the
court
of
appeals'
affirmance
with
respect
to
the
corporation
and
i
suspect
that
perhaps,
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
our
motion
petition
for
rehearing
is
still
pending
because
there
is
a
relationship
between
the
two
cases.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
yes.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
well,
i
don't
know
mr.
justice
black,
if
i
could
slaughter
into
anyone
of
those
categories,
but
i
think
i
would
rely
upon
the
principle
that
was
stated
in
us
against
boyd,
that
no
court
should
decree
a
discovery
which
will
tend
to
convict
a
person
or
corporation
of
a
crime.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
but
mr.
justice
brennan,
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
as
i
read
boyd,
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
holding
of
boyd
or
the
language
in
boyd
is
somewhat
broader
than
the
fourth
or
fifth
amendment.
indeed,
it
goes
to
the
point
that
there's
even
a
possible
fourth
amendment
violation.
it's
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
and
the
district
court
and
i
know
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
mr.
chief
justice,
the
case
did
deal
with
private
papers.
but
there
is
language
in
the
boyd
case
which
the
district
judge
in
our
case,
who
ruled
against
the
us
on
this
motion
to
suppress
by
the
way,
felt,
suggests
that
the
boyd
holding
is
broader
than
a
fifth
amendment
or
private
papers
in
that,
it's
basically
unfair.
it's
violative
of
the
public
policy
which
is
rooted,
this
is
their
language,
rooted
in
historical
and
several
concepts
of
anglo-saxon
criminal
jurisprudence
that
a
defendant
or
a
prospective
defendant
should
not
be
required
to
disclose
evidence
to
sustain
the
prosecution
against
them
in
a
criminal
case
or
his
evidence
of
defense
and
in
the
fair
case
and
in
any
number
of
cases,
they
make
the
point
that
this
is
not
a
manner
of
fifth
amendment.
it's
broader
than
the
possible
violation
of
a
privilege
of
self-incrimination
and
that
the
issue
is
also
whether
the
methods
employed
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
--
whether
the
methods
employed
in
obtaining
such
an
information
show
such
unfairness
that
the
evidence
should
be
inadmissible
apart
from
fifth
amendment
consideration.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
well,
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
the
standard
here
would
be
when
one
views
the
facts.
no
different
from
what
the
standard
was
in
the
mcnab
case
or
in
the
reid
case.
what
happen
here,
i
think
this
should
be
stressed,
is
that
the
interrogatories
were
prepared
by
mr.
josh
randolph
of
the
food
and
drug
administration
at
the
same
time
that
he
prepared
a
notice,
notifying
the
defendants,
all
of
the
defendants
including
the
corporation
that
their
investigation
revealed
defendants'
responsibility
for
criminal
violations
of
the
act.
now
this
notice
said,
just
that
it,
it
didn't
say
we
have
it
under
considerations.
it
says,
our
investigation,
this
is
on
page
105
in
our
appendix
in
the
brief,
investigation
by
this
administration
indicates
your
responsibility
for
violation
of
the
act,
and
then
they
spell
out
the
violation.
now,
the
same
individual
who
was
investigating
and
this
was
mr.
randolph's
testimony,
he
was
in
charge
of
the
investigation
the
criminal
case
and
he
was
in
charge
of
preparing
the
interrogatories
in
a
civil
case.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
the
notice
was
sent
out
on
december
29.
there
were
received
on
january
the
15h,
the
interrogatories
were
received
on
january
the
9th.
they
were
virtually
simultaneous.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
no,
sir.
no,
mister
--
the
interrogatories
were
answered
in
september,
but
because
the
motion
had
been
made
in
the
meantime
to
stay
the
answering
of
these
interrogatories.
but
what
happened
was,
when
he
got
the
answers,
he
then
made
a
recommendation,
his
second
recommendation
to
indict
that
the
defendants
be
indicted
and
to
refer
the
matter
to
the
department
of
justice,
this
within
a
matter
of
a
week
or
two
and
as
the
record
shows
in
discussing
the
matter
with
the
food
and
drug
administration
official
in
detroit,
mr.
randolph
being
in
washington,
he
made
it
a
point
of
telling
the
fda
official
in
detroit
who
was
handling
the
civil
case
on
the
local
scene
to
be
sure
to
send
him
the
answers
to
the
interrogatories.
and
when
he
said
he
would,
and
did,
he
then
called
mr.
fowler
in
detroit
and
told
mr.
fowler
the
he'd
liked
the
send
out
another
notice
of
criminal
violation
which
is
the
fourth
notice
which
they
sent
out,
which
now
broadened
the
first
three,
they
actually
sent
three
out
almost
at
the
same
time
but
the
fourth
one
was
sent
out
after
they've
had
the
answers
and
a
second
recommendation
was
made
to
indict
these
defendants.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
i
would
answer
mr.
justice
black
this
way
that
the
standard
is
a
standard
which
depends
upon
the
facts
in
any
given
case.
i'm
not
asking
this
court
nor
the
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
i
would
say,
it's
a
standard
of
fairness
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
and
i
was
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
i
would
say
the
court
should
decide
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
whether
under
our
form
of
free
government,
whether
drawing
upon
the
concepts
of
criminal
jurisprudence
which
have
come
to
us
through
the
ages,
whether
it
is
inherently
unfair
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
through
the
ages,
yes
sir.
mr.
justice.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
well,
the
boyd
case
which
is
still
as
vital
as
it
was
in
the
19
century
seems
to
require
that
the
courts
to
decide
these
--
some
of
these
cases
on
the
mcnab
case
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
the
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
well,
i
think
the
narrow
--
the
technical
holding
of
boyd
was
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
fourth
amendment
as
i
read
the
case
mr.
justice
black
and
the
district
court
here
apparently
felt
that
it's
even
broader
than
that.
in
that
there
is
something
unfair
in
requiring
a
defendant
in
a
civil
case
to
and
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
what
is
unfair
about
it
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
--
mr.
justice
black
is
that
where
there
is
a
civil
case,
he
is
faced
with
what
i
would
call
a
cruel
trilemma,
either
a
cruel
trilemma,
he
must
either
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
trilemma
and
the
court
of
appeals
made
this
point,
he
is
then
confronted
with
three
alternatives.
he
can
answer
the
questions
and
lie
in
which
event
he
can
be
guilty
of
perjury.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
that
is
true,
but
that's
one
of
the
alternatives
which
he
shouldn't
be
required
to
select.
the
second
one
is
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
well,
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
well,
he
could
claim
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
i
think
the
problem
mr.
justice
black
here
is
that
the
government
is
arguing
a
very
technical
and
very
mechanical
interpretation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
that
is
a
different
question,
but
it's
related
to
the
question
which
your
honor
asks
for
this
reason.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
well,
mcnab
was
not
decided
on
any
constitutional
provision
as
i
recall
the
mcnab
case.
it
was
decided
on
the
basis
that
it
was
inherently
unfair
for
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
well,
[attempt
to
laughter]
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart.
there
are
rules
as
i
now
i
understand
the
point
there
are
rules
in
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
which
allows
certain
forms
of
discovery.
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
i
would
say
that
the
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
which
incorporates
the
mcnab
rule,
i
believe,
its
41
(b)
into
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
the
rule
i'm
referring
to
has
the
effect
mr.
justice
black
as
i
read
the
rule
of
granting
the
court
authority
to
supervise
the
fair
administration
of
criminal
justice
and
the
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
i
believe
it's
41
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
your
honors,
may
i
point
out
in
that
connection
of
fairness
that
in
the
instant
case,
an
official
of
the
food
and
drug
administration
testified,
that
it
was
the
routine
practice
over
the
past
38
years
for
the
food
and
drug
administration
to
file
interrogatories
and
then
take
the
answers
to
those
interrogatories
and
use
them
in
the
criminal
case
at
the
very
time
that
the
court,
the
fda
was
considering
a
criminal
case
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
that's
--
that's
a
protection.
now,
they
seek
to
deny
us
this
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
except
mr.
chief
justice
that
in
this
case,
they
would
deny
us
that
protection
because
they
say,
technically
the
interrogatories
were
directed
to
the
corporation
which
doesn't
enjoy
the
privilege,
and
we
say,
and
the
court
held
below
that
kordel
was
the
dominant
personality,
the
corporation
was
merely
a
device,
an
instrumentality
through
which
he
sold
his
products,
that
the
interrogatories
would
directed
in
his
activities
and
that
since
they
choose
to
get
this
information
about
him
by
asking
a
corporation
the
questions
in
effect
since
they
have
breeched
the
corporate
veil
and
the
questions
that
they
asked,
they
shouldn't
be
permitted
to
repair
that
breech
to
deny
kordel
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
that
was
i
believe
your
honor
asked
me
that
question
before
and
he
did
not
assert
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
he
did
not
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
he
did
not
assert
it
but
i
think
a
more
complete
answer
your
honor
would
be
that
he
did
not
waive
it
either
because
of
the
motion
that
was
made
at
the
time
to
excuse
him
from
being
or
excuse
the
corporation
from
being
required
to
answered
the
question.
now,
what
they
say
kordel
should
have
done?
they
admit
kordel
and
feldten
had
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
they
didn't
have
to
answer,
but
they
say
and
this
is
the
crux
of
their
case,
they
say
that
the
corporation
should
have
appointed
a
third
party,
some
agent,
to
answer
the
questions
and
in
effect
what
they're
saying
is,
of
course
the
corporation
could
only
act
through
a
human
being,
they're
saying
that
kordel,
who
would
himself
had
a
privilege
not
to
answer,
should
have
appointed
that
an
agent
and
then
supplied
him
with
the
information
to
answer
the
questions
which
he
himself
would
have
been
privileged
to
withhold.
and
they
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
there
is
an
agent
available,
why
is
the
corporations'
attorney,
who
happens
to
be
me,
that
what
i
should
do
is
sign
the
answers
to
the
--
sign
the
answers
to
the
interrogatories
in
behalf
of
the
corporation.
but
the
only
way
that
i
could
get
the
information
available
to
the
corporation
is
by
asking
my
client,
mr.
kordel,
the
president
of
the
corporation
as
to
whom
they
sought
admissions.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
yes,
i
was
your
honor.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
i
advised
him
at
that
time
your
honor
and
we
did
file
a
motion
to
be
excused
from
answering
the
questions
temporarily,
pending
the
outcome
of
the
criminal
case
and
when
the
judge,
it
was
judge
levin
of
the
district
court,
heard
the
argument,
the
government
represented
to
the
court
and
this
is
in
the
record,
that
there
was
no
certainty
when
or
if
or
whether
or
if
there
would
ever
be
a
criminal
case
so
the
court
said.
well
at
this
point,
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
well,
i
admired
that
in
this
case
mr.
justice
black.
but
what
happened
is,
of
course,
there
might
never
be
a
case
if
the
answers
to
the
interrogatories
didn't
reveal
evidence
to
support
their
position,
but
if
they
had
a
case,
they
should
have
brought
it.
they
didn't
need
the
admissions
either
to
lay
the
basis
for
summary
judgment
or
to
press
forth
on
the
case
before
it
because
is
--
if
they
have
all
these
evidence,
they
can
go
back
and
retry
the
case
without
too
much
difficulty.
thank
you.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
yes
sir.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
the
court
of
appeals
answered
that
question
and
i'd
like
to
refer
to
the
court
to
not
only
with
the
court
of
appeals
said
but
the
actual
transcript.
on
page
142
and
143,
i
asked
the
question
of
the
witness
as
to
whether
they
anticipated
difficulty
in
proving
interstate
commerce
with
respect
to
the
principle
product
known
as
“korleen”
and
the
answer
was
that
they
had
difficulty
proving
interstate
commerce
with
respect
to
korleen
manufactured
by
a
different
manufacturer.
but
with
respect
to
the
manufacturer
that
was
involved
in
this
case,
they
wouldn't
have
such
difficulty
because
they
have
the
answers
to
the
interrogatories.
secondly,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
these
answers
to
the
interrogatories,
which
they
say
was
not
necessary
to
get
the
indictment,
was
brought
into
the
grand
jury
room
as
part
of
one
file
which
they
had
--
to
which
they
had
put
both
the
civil
and
the
criminal
aspects
and
the
results
of
their
investigation,
that
appears
on
page
192
and
193
where
i
asked
the
witness,
and
isn't
true
that
you
used
to
assists
you
in
your
testimony
with
the
grand
jury
almost
all
the
papers
that
were
in
that
one
file
which
had
combined
the
civil
and
the
criminal
case?
answer:
i
reviewed
the
entire
file
before
i
went
before
the
grand
jury,
yes,
sir.
i
had
it
with
me
and
i
used
it
in
preparing
for
the
grand
jury,
yes
sir.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
that
was
for
the
indictment.
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
that
the
interstate
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
that
was
prior
to
the
trial
but
with
respect
to
the
interstate
commerce.
when
we
identified
the
manufacturer
of
the
korleen,
that
evidence
was
introduced
into
the
trial
not
on
the
form
of
answer
to
the
interrogatory,
that's
true,
but
the
information
which
they
believe
and
the
final
answer
is,
in
the
court
of
appeals
make
straights
laid
great
stress
on
this,
it
had
been
the
practice
of
the
fda
for
38
years,
a
practice
by
the
way
which
is
received
a
great
deal
of
criticism
in
the
administrative
law
review
journal
and
other
members
of
a
food
and
drug
bar,
a
practice
whereby
they
bring
a
relatively
simple
procedure
to
follow
a
civil
case,
do
nothing
to
protect
the
public
either
by
summary
judgment,
multiple
seizures
or
what
have
you.
and
then,
put
everything
in
a
one
case
into
one
file
and
indict
it
first
and
that's
what
happened
here
and
as
the
rights
would
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
corporation
under
these
circumstances
as
well
as
the
individual
because
it's
inherently
unfair
and
uphold
to
the
form
of
criminal
procedure
which
we
would
like
to
see
in
our
land
to
allow
the
government
to
use
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
i
believe
i
got
that
from
mr.
justice
black,
from
a
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
abel
case,
us
against
abel,
and
the
--
i
feel
very
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
it's
a
related
problem
in
that
--
the
court
there
was
dealing
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
as
i
recall
that
case
sir.
that
case
--
mr.
solomon
h.
friend
i
believe
you
did.
i
thank
you
very
much
mr.
chief
justice.
