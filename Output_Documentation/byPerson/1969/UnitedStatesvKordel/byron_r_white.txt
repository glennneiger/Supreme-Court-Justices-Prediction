was
there
any
room
to
pierce
a
corporate
veil
in
the
fifth
amendment
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
or
may
not
have
been
there,
but
would
it
ever
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
there
be
in
your
view
a
violation
of
fifth
amendment
if
these
people
had
not
been
doing
business
in
the
corporate
form
but
as
a
partnership
and
the
same
thing
happened?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
assume
a
civil
action
started,
interrogatories
to
the
parties
and
the
strap
was
that
if
they
can't
answer
them,
their
property
would
be
forfeited,
compulsion?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
wouldn't
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
--
in
order
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
even
then
that
the
compulsion,
wouldn't
that
have
to
be
that
the
forfeiture
would
occur
as
a
result
of
a
failure
answers
interrogatories
rather
than
the
strengths
of
the
government's
case
in
the
civil
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
i
think
not
automatic
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
not
automatic
at
all,
but
you
lose
your
suit
because
you
refuse
to
answer?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
case
to
this
court
indicates
that
there
would
be,
aside
from
fifth
amendment
problems
put
those
aside,
and
what
case
in
this
court
do
you
suggest
would
for
preclude
the
government
from
bringing
a
civil
suit
deliberately
for
the
purpose
of
using
compulsory
processes
of
the
civil
suit
to
gather
evidence
for
a
criminal
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
be
a
constitutional
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
constitutional
due
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
we're
postulating
the
fifth
amendment
problem.
is
the
postulating
no
fifth
amendment's
issue,
so
what
other
bill
of
rights
and
provision
is
violated
by
using
a
civil
processes
for
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assuming
if
it
gets
to
background
of
the
fifth
amendment
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
though,
if
the
interrogatories
here
had
not
been
signed
by
either
one
of
these
two
men
but
had
been
signed
by
some
other
officer
of
the
corporation?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
i
know
that.
but
in
the
criminal
case,
let's
assume
that
they
had
a
criminal
case
going
and
they
subpoenaed
the
files
of
the
corporation
not
the
files
of
the
individual
defendants,
the
files
of
the
corporation.
i
suppose
they
could
get
it,
couldn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
alright
that
they
were
getting
no
more,
putting
the
fifth
amendment
aside,
they
were
giving
no
more
by
getting
corporate
evidence
then
they
could
get
in
the
criminal
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
in
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
affirming
the
judgment
against
the
corporation?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
search
and
seizure,
no
--
