mr.
wallace,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
many
civil
cases
have
been
lost
because
of
the
disinclination
of
the
defendant
in
the
civil
case
answer
some
question
which
might
incriminate
him,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
could
easily
happen
in
a
tax,
civil
tax
case,
that
a
defendant
might
assert
the
fifth
amendment
that
he
would
take
the
risk
of
jeopardizing
his
case
possibly
by
doing
so
and
he
might
suffer
the
consequence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
friend.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
let
me
while
we
have
you
stopped
for
the
moment
mr.
friend,
suppose
you've
tried
the
civil
case,
in
the
civil
case
instead
of
eliciting
these
answers
by
discovery,
the
same
answers
were
--
the
same
questions
were
put
to
the
individual
officers
here
involved.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
they
not
at
that
time
have
had
the
choice
to
decline
to
answer
on
fifth
amendment
grounds
or
answer
as
they
did?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
how
is
that
different
from
having
a
question,
refusal
made
in
the
court
room
sitting
on
the
witness
chair,
other
than
on
fifth
amendment
grounds
and
then
having
a
order
from
the
court
directing
him
to
answer
the
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
if
it's
neither?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
a
question.
suppose
you
had
a
civil
case
started,
no
criminal
case
in
completion
or
investigation
and
the
testimony
in
the
trial
of
the
civil
case
satisfied
the
prosecutor
that
there
was
a
criminal
case
which
could
be
made
out
and
then
he
got
an
indictment
after
the
disposition
of
the
civil
case.
would
you
make
these
same
claims?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
does
the
constitutional
question
you're
arguing
depend
upon
the
motivation
of
the
prosecutor
in
pressing
the
civil
case
first?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
did
not
--
but
did
not
this
court
in
the
boyd
case
emphasized
with
great
particularity
that
it
was
private
papers,
private
papers
that
were
being
seized
and
cited
a
british
judge
from
a
couple
of
100
years
before
that
man's
private
papers
are
among
his
most
--
that
his
dearest
possession,
some
language
of
that
kind.
now,
you
don't
have
private
papers
here,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
that
notice
get
delivered
before
the
interrogatories
were
answered?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
had
the
interrogatories
been
answered
by
the
15?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think,
i
may
have
diverted
you
from
responding
to
justice
black's
question
about
the
standards
that
he,
so
i
tell
you
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
didn't
the
constitution
put
a
barrier
up
so
that
was
the
protection
for
all
the
citizens
by
saying
that
if
a
question
might,
it
need
not
be
one
which
is
bound
to
incriminate
you,
but
if
it
has
tendency
to
incriminate
you,
you
do
not
need
to
answer.
you
cannot
be
forced
to
answer,
isn't
that
the
protection?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
can
you
have
a
better
protection
in
the
matter
an
absolute
right
to
refuse
to
answer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
two
minutes
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.

you
