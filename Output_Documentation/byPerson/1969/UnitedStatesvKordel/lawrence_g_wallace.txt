mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
prosecution
under
the
federal
food
and
drug
laws.
respondents
and
detroit
vital
foods
incorporated,
the
corporation
of
which
they
were
officers
were
convicted
after
a
jury
trial
on
five
counts
of
an
indictment
charging
them
with
misbranding
of
drugs.
the
corporation
is
not
before
this
court
on
present
petition.
the
sentences
imposed
by
the
district
court
are
summarized
in
our
brief
on
pages
2
and
3.
the
evidence
showed
that
respondent
kordel
was
president
of
the
corporation
and
the
author
of
books
and
leaflets
promoting
its
products
and
that
he
traveled
across
the
country
delivering
lectures
which
were
advertised
and
open
to
the
public.
the
writings
and
lectures
claimed
that
specified
ailments
could
alleviated
by
the
consumption
of
certain
foods
and
food
elements
and
that
the
best
sources
of
these
were
the
products
offered
for
sale
by
the
corporation.
these
products
were
sold
in
booths
and/or
near
the
lecture
halls
and
were
also
available
in
health
food
stores
generally.
respondent
feldten
acted
as
kordel's
assistant
selling
products
at
the
lectures
and
taking
orders
for
shipments
from
detroit.
the
criminal
charges
were
that
as
to
some
of
the
products
certain
of
the
books
and
leaflets
constituted
part
of
the
labeling
and
contained
false
and
misleading
statements.
and
as
to
all
of
the
counts
on
which
respondents
were
convicted,
the
products
which
they
claim
to
be
merely
food
supplements
were
in
fact
drugs
because
they
were
intended
by
the
defendants
to
be
used
for
the
prevention
and
treatment
of
various
diseases
and
health
conditions,
and
that
the
labeling
of
these
products
failed
to
set
forth
adequate
directions
for
the
uses
for
which
they
were
intended
as
required
by
the
act.
since
the
oral
representations
made
in
respondent
kordel's
public
lectures
were
relevant
in
showing
the
uses
for
which
the
products
were
intended,
tape
recordings
of
his
public
lectures
were
introduced
into
evidence
by
the
government
at
the
trial.
at
this
point,
i
believe
a
summary
of
the
relevant
procedural
chronology
will
be
helpful
to
the
court.
the
indictment
in
this
case
was
returned
in
the
summer
of
1963.
previously,
in
june
of
1960,
the
government
had
filed
a
libel
proceeding
under
section
334
of
the
act
to
condemn
quantities
of
the
corporation's
products
as
misbranded.
the
corporation
appeared
as
claimant
in
this
in
rem
proceeding
and
filed
an
answer
denying
the
material
allegations
of
the
complaint.
the
parties
then
served
interrogatories
upon
each
other,
pursuant
to
rule
33
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
the
government's
interrogatories
were
served
in
january
and
april
of
1961
and
sought
among
other
things
detailed
information
about
the
labeling,
testing,
manufacture,
and
composition
of
certain
of
the
products
and
about
kordel's
oral
representations
concerning
the
efficacy
of
these
products
made
during
public
lectures
that
he
gave
in
detroit.
in
late
january
1961,
shortly
after
service
of
the
government's
initial
interrogatories,
the
corporation
received
a
notice
from
the
government
pursuant
to
section
335
of
the
act,
indicating
that
criminal
prosecution
of
the
corporation
and
of
respondents
was
contemplated
in
part
for
the
same
conduct
that
was
the
subject
of
the
libel.
the
corporation
then
in
april
1961
moved
that
the
district
court
extend
its
time
to
respond
to
the
interrogatories
until
final
disposition
of
any
criminal
prosecution
that
might
be
brought.
the
district
court
denied
this
motion
in
june
1961,
holding
that
their
was
no
certainty,
when
or
whether
a
criminal
prosecution
would
be
brought
and
that
there
is
no
prejudice
in
requiring
the
corporation
to
answer
the
interrogatories
since
the
same
information
would
otherwise
become
available
to
the
government
in
any
event
from
the
trial
of
the
libel
proceeding.
pursuant
to
the
court's
order,
the
corporation
then
filed
answers
to
some
of
the
interrogatories
in
september
1961
and
filed
specific
objections
to
others.
in
subsequent
proceedings,
some
of
the
objections
were
sustained
and
some
are
overruled
and
the
government
withdrew
some
of
the
interrogatories.
the
corporation
then
answered
the
remaining
interrogatories
in
september
1962.
respondent
feldten
subscribed
to
all
of
the
corporation's
answers
as
vice
president
and
stated
that
they
were
true
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge
and
belief,
but
that
not
all
of
the
answers
were
known
to
him
personally.
the
libel
proceeding
thereafter
terminated
in
a
consent
decree,
entered
in
november
1962.
in
june
1962,
after
service
of
the
interrogatories
and
after
the
corporation's
initial
answers,
but
prior
to
its
supplemental
answers,
the
food
and
drug
administration
referred
the
matter
to
the
department
of
justice
with
the
recommendation
for
criminal
prosecution.
the
indictment
was
returned
in
august
1963.
in
march
1965,
defendants
in
the
criminal
case
moved
to
suppress
any
evidence
obtained
by
the
government
as
a
result
of
the
corporation's
answers
to
the
interrogatories
in
the
libel
proceeding
or
in
the
alternative
for
a
hearing
to
determine
the
government's
motive
in
bringing
the
civil
action
and
serving
the
interrogatories.
the
district
court
granted
the
alternative
request
for
a
hearing
which
lasted
three
days.
the
transcript
of
the
hearing,
set
forth
in
the
appendix
at
pages
58
to
290,
showed
that
at
the
time
the
civil
case
was
filed,
the
food
and
drug
administration
already
had
evidence
sufficient
in
its
judgment
to
establish
all
the
elements
of
the
criminal
violations,
but
had
not
yet
decided
whether
to
recommend
criminal
prosecution
that
the
agency
determined
that
the
in
rem
seizure
proceeding
should
be
commenced
promptly
in
order
to
prevent
harm
to
the
public
from
continued
distribution
of
the
misbranded
drugs.
and
that
the
interrogatories
were
designed
solely
for
the
purposes
of
the
civil
suit
and
were
submitted
as
they
are
routinely
in
such
suits
in
an
effort
to
narrow
the
issues
for
trial
and
in
the
hope
of
laying
the
foundation
for
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
or
possibly
inducing
the
corporation
to
agree
to
a
consent
decree
by
demonstrating
the
insubstantiality
of
its
case
which
is
what
eventually
happened.
the
district
court
held
on
the
basis
of
this
hearing
that
the
governmental
decisions
to
commence
the
civil
suit
and
to
serve
the
interrogatories
were
made
in
good
faith
and
not
for
the
purpose
of
procuring
evidence
for
a
criminal
prosecution,
and
the
conviction
followed.
and
while
not
disagreeing
with
these
findings,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
respondent's
convictions
on
the
ground
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
of
the
individual
criminal
defendants
have
been
violated
by
requiring
the
corporation
to
answer
the
interrogatories
in
the
civil
proceeding.
the
court
held
that
it
was
constitutionally
insufficient
that
the
government
had
acted
in
good
faith
in
the
civil
proceeding
and
that
none
of
the
answers
to
the
interrogatories
had
been
introduced
into
evidence
in
the
criminal
case.
it
held
that
the
government
must
also
prove
that
it
had
not
in
anyway
utilized
for
purposes
of
the
criminal
case,
information
or
leads
obtained
from
the
answers
to
the
interrogatories.
in
its
initial
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
also
reversed
the
corporation's
conviction,
but
on
the
government's
petition
for
rehearing,
it
modified
its
opinion
in
judgment
so
as
to
affirm
that
conviction
on
the
ground
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
available
under
this
court's
decisions
only
to
natural
persons
and
not
to
a
corporation.
a
petition
for
certiorari
by
the
corporation
was
denied
by
this
court
and
a
petition
for
rehearing
is
presently
pending.
we
contend,
first,
that
the
court
of
appeals
aired
in
holding
that
respondents
privilege
against
self-incrimination
had
been
violated.
neither
of
the
respondents
had
interposed
any
claim
to
the
seized
drugs,
nor
did
either
of
them
have
a
personal
property
interest
in
the
drugs.
neither
of
them
was
party
to
the
civil
action.
neither
of
them
was
obligated
or
required
to
answer
any
of
the
interrogatories
served
on
the
corporation
in
that
proceeding,
and
indeed,
respondent
kordel
supplied
no
answers.
and
respondent
feldten
who
did
submit
answers
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
stated
therein
that
the
truth
of
the
answers
was
not
known
to
him
personally,
so
the
answers
did
not
constitute
an
admission
on
his
part.
and
finally,
neither
respondent
in
anyway
claimed
that
his
privilege
was
being
violated
when
respondent
feldten
submitted
the
answers
on
behalf
of
the
corporation.
the
explicit
language
of
rule
33
dealing
with
interrogatories
and
the
decisions
implementing
the
rule
make
clear
that
when
a
corporation
is
the
party
served
with
interrogatories,
the
corporation
is
obligated
to
appoint
an
agent
who
without
fear
of
self-incrimination
can
furnish
such
requested
information
as
is
available
to
the
corporation.
no
claim
was
made
in
the
libel
proceeding
that
answers
to
any
of
the
questions
were
not
available
to
the
corporation
within
the
meaning
of
the
rule
because
the
only
repositories
of
the
information
were
individuals
who
might
incriminate
themselves
by
disclosing
it.
no
individual
is
required
under
the
rule
to
submit
any
answer
on
the
corporation's
behalf
that
might
tend
to
incriminate
him
personally.
but
the
corporation
which
under
this
court's
decisions
has
no
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
cannot
invoke
the
privilege
of
any
individual
on
its
behalf
remains
obligated
under
the
rule
to
provide
such
requested
information
as
is
available
to
it.
to
the
extent
that
this
obligation
with
the
attendant
risk
that
failure
of
the
corporation
to
comply
might
result
in
a
judgment
forfeiting
the
corporation's
property
constitutes
compulsion.
it
is
compulsion
of
the
corporation
which
has
no
privilege
and
not
of
the
respondents
as
officers
or
shareholders
of
the
corporation.
to
hold
otherwise
would
be
to
overrule
campbell
painting
corporation
against
reid
in
volume
392
u.s.
and
its
predecessor
decisions
because
compulsion
of
a
corporation
to
provide
possibly
incriminating
information
can
always
be
said
to
amount
to
compulsion
of
its
individual
officers
or
shareholders.
they
cannot
utilized
the
corporate
form
of
doing
business
and
yet
claim
a
personal
interest
in
the
corporation's
property
only
for
purposes
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
that
is
the
meaning
of
these
court's
decisions
and
it
was
error
in
our
view
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
hold
to
the
contrary.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
that
that
was
the
issue
in
campbell
painting
corporation
against
reid.
certainly,
the
dissenting
opinion
is
base
on
the
view
that
that
would
have
been
an
appropriate
occasion
for
piercing
the
corporate
veil,
that
was
the
closely
held
corporation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
would
be
a
departure
from
the
holding
that
we've
had
consistently
that
non-personal
entities
do
not
enjoy
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they
certainly
could
have
claimed
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
as
individuals,
even
though
they
were
doing
business
as
a
partnership.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
now,
that
that's
always
a
possible
sanction
under
the
civil
rules.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
could
have
claimed
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
providing
it
was
adequately
founded
as
to
particular
questions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
just
as
respondent
feldten
could
have
claimed
in
this
case.
so
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
to
resolve
the
answering.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
true.
there
might
be
some
question
as
to
whether
the
mere
failure
to
answer
the
interrogatories
and
the
possible
sanctions
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
compulsion.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
certainly
is
not
especially
if
you
have
a
well
founded
claim
of
privilege
as
the
basis
for
your
refusal.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
to
the
best
of
my
belief
it
is
so.
but
as
i
said,
to
the
extent
that
there
was
compulsion
under
the
civil
rules
in
this
case.
it
was
compulsion
on
the
corporation
which
has
no
constitutional
privilege
not
to
be
compelled
to
submitting
incriminating
information,
that's
what
the
court
has
held.
the
rumor
starts
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
your
honor.
we
have
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
an
in
rem
proceeding,
the
corporation
being
the
claimant
was
the
other
party.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
have
also
addressed
our
brief
to
the
broader
concern
which
seems
to
underlie
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
the
question
of
fairness
in
the
administration
by
government
agencies
in
this
and
other
fields
of
their
responsibilities
under
statutes
which
provide
for
the
possibility
of
both
civil
and
criminal
remedies
against
defending
corporations
or
individuals.
our
brief
discusses
the
practices
and
experiences
of
several
agencies
and
articulates
some
general
criteria
which
seem
to
us
to
be
suggested
by
the
leading
cases
in
this
field.
and
we
also
discuss
the
matter
to
which
i
would
now
like
to
turn
our
contention
that
there
was
no
unfairness
in
the
administration
of
the
food
and
drug
laws
in
this
case.
there
was
in
the
first
place
an
important
need
to
protect
the
public
from
harm
here
as
is
frequently
true
in
food
and
drug
or
in
securities
fraud
cases
for
that
matter,
by
commencing
the
civil
proceedings
promptly.
it
was
at
the
very
least
reasonable
for
the
responsible
officials
to
decide
that
this
protection
of
the
public
should
not
await
determination
of
whether
a
criminal
prosecution
would
also
be
appropriate,
let
alone
final
disposition
of
any
criminal
proceeding
that
might
be
instituted.
moreover,
it
was
important
to
proceed
to
judgment
in
the
condemnation
case
because
congress
has
for
good
reasons
referred
to
in
our
brief,
provided
in
section
334
of
the
act
set
forth
at
pages
26
and
27
of
our
brief
that
the
government
must
obtain
a
favorable
judgment
in
a
forfeiture
case
before
it
can
proceed
by
multiple
seizures
against
traditional
quantities
of
the
drugs
being
marketed
elsewhere.
the
interrogatories
served
on
the
corporation
were
found
after
a
hearing
to
have
been
designed
in
good
faith
for
the
legitimate
purpose
of
expediting
the
civil
suit
to
judgment.
the
questions
asked
were
relevant
to
the
issues
in
the
civil
proceeding
even
though,
the
court
of
appeals
seem
to
believed
that
some
of
them
were
not
apparently
because
it
did
not
appreciate
the
bearing
of
respondent
kordel's
oral
representations
of
the
public
lectures
on
the
theory
of
the
government
civil
case,
which
dependent
on
proof
of
the
uses
for
which
the
products
being
marketed
by
the
corporation
were
intended.
in
their
brief,
the
respondents
suggest
a
lack
of
fairness
because
the
government
could
have
utilized
an
alternative
procedure
of
seeking
interim
injunctive
relief
instead
of
the
libel
in
rem.
but
the
same
interrogatories
would
have
been
equally
irrelevant
to
establishing
the
government's
case
in
an
injunctive
proceeding.
moreover,
a
judgment
in
an
in
rem
proceeding
provides
more
effective
protection
of
the
public
because
it
enables
the
government
expeditiously
to
prevent
further
dissemination
of
the
misbranded
drugs
by
anyone
holding
them
for
sale.
a
final
indication
of
the
government's
fairness
in
this
case
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
shortly
after
service
of
the
initial
interrogatories
and
prior
to
the
corporation's
answering
of
them,
the
government
notified
the
corporation
pursuant
to
section
335
of
the
act,
that
criminal
prosecution
of
respondents
and
the
corporation
was
being
considered.
respondents
could
thus
judge
whether
providing
answers
to
the
interrogatories
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
might
tend
to
incriminate
them
and
indeed
the
not
very
revealing
answers
actually
furnished
and
set
forth
in
the
appendix
suggests
that
this
consideration
did
not
escape
their
attention.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
required
by
the
statute
in
section
335,
title
21
your
honor.
we
do
not
rest,
however,
on
a
contention
that
the
government
learned
nothing
from
these
answers,
a
matter
as
to
which
it
is
generally
difficult
to
sustain
a
burden
of
proof
such
as
the
court
of
appeals
here
imposed.
our
position
is
that
because
the
interrogatories
were
used
properly
and
fairly
in
a
good
faith
civil
suit
for
the
legitimate
purposes
of
that
suit,
there
is
no
more
reason
for
preventing
the
government
from
basing
a
criminal
investigation
on
information
learned
thereby,
than
there
would
be
for
preventing
it
from
basing
an
investigation
on
information
legitimately
revealed
in
the
course
of
any
other
good
faith
civil
proceeding
whether
between
private
parties
or
similarly
involving
the
government
as
a
party.
exclusionary
rules
in
their
various
permutations
have
after
all
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
required
only
where
otherwise
relevant
and
competent
evidence
has
been
illegally
or
improperly
obtained.
and
in
our
view,
it
would
ill
serve
the
cause
of
justice
for
the
court
now
to
depart
from
that
principle
and
we
therefore
ask
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
case
has
been
relied
upon
in
litigation.
in
securities
fraud
cases
for
example.
i'd
been
informed
by
the
staff
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
i
think
that
the
food
and
drug
and
the
securities
areas
are
the
ones
in
which
the
problem
is
most
likely
to
arise
because
they
are
the
areas
in
which
the
government
agencies
most
frequently
find
it
necessary
to
proceed
quickly
with
civil
proceedings
before
a
determination
can
be
made
as
to
whether
criminal
prosecution
is
warranted.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
surely,
the
result
would
have
been
justified
if
the
in
rem
proceeding
had
been
brought
in
bad
faith
merely
as
a
device
for
securing
evidence
to
be
used
in
the
criminal
proceeding
or
as
an
improper
instrument
of
criminal
investigation.
i
think
if
the
hearing
had
showed
that
and
there
had
been
a
finding
to
that
effect,
then
the
result
would
have
been
justified,
although,
we
can't
accept
the
rational
that
the
violation
was
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
don't
think
there
is
a
precise
holding
to
that
effect,
but
there
certainly
is
in
the
procter
and
gamble
case
concern
expressed
in
the
opinion.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
need
not
rise
to
that
level
in
order
for
a
relief
to
be
granted
in
a
federal
prosecution
of
course,
but
we
believe
that
it
would
present
a
question
under
the
fifth
amendment's
due
process
clause.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
correct
and
i
should
think
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
--
there
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
amounts
to
a
forum
of
the
due
process
violation
if
the
specified
criminal
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
the
specified
procedures
in
a
criminal
case
are
not
followed
as
they
were
intended
to
be
followed
with
the
safeguards
provided
for
the
securing
of
criminal
evidence
elsewhere
in
the
bill
of
rights.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i'm
not
--
i
don't
think
civil
interrogatories
of
the
sort
provided
for
in
the
civil
rules
would
necessarily
pass
muster
in
the
ordinary
processes
of
criminal
procedure.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
may
will
be
no
constitutional
violation
in
that
situation.
all
we
say
in
our
brief
is
that,
it
seemed
to
us
that
the
due
process
clause
provided
the
more
appropriate
framework
for
considering
this
issues
than
the
self
incrimination
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment
in
this
case.
i
don't
--
we
didn't
mean
to
concede
that
the
due
process
clause
would
be
violated
in
such
a
situation.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
please.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
government
did
not
make
multiple
seizures
eventually
in
this
case
and
in
administering
food
and
drug
laws
the
government
tries
to
avoid
making
multiple
seizures
of
products
that
are
not
harmful
in
themselves.
but
the
availability
of
multiple
seizures
as
a
sanction
after
in
a
misbranding
case,
a
favorable
judgment
is
procured
and
a
forfeiture
proceeding
can
served
as
an
inducement
to
get
a
consent
decree
that
will
eliminate
the
misbranding
which
is
what
we
were
seeking
to
do
in
this
case
and
not
to
forfeit
someone's
property
that
in
the
absence
of
the
misbranding
should
be
allowed
to
be
disseminated.
the
record
does
not
show
to
what
extent
kordel
and
the
corporation
should
be
considered
to
be
altered
egos
in
the
situation
that
was
involved
here,
but
it
does
show
that
the
corporation
never
made
any
claim
that
the
information
requested
was
not
available
to
it
within
the
meaning
of
rule
33
because
only
kordel
knew
the
information
and
he
didn't
want
to
disclose
it.
the
corporation
never
made
that
claim.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
prosecution
under
the
federal
food
and
drug
laws.
respondents
and
detroit
vital
foods
incorporated,
the
corporation
of
which
they
were
officers
were
convicted
after
a
jury
trial
on
five
counts
of
an
indictment
charging
them
with
misbranding
of
drugs.
the
corporation
is
not
before
this
court
on
present
petition.
the
sentences
imposed
by
the
district
court
are
summarized
in
our
brief
on
pages
2
and
3.
the
evidence
showed
that
respondent
kordel
was
president
of
the
corporation
and
the
author
of
books
and
leaflets
promoting
its
products
and
that
he
traveled
across
the
country
delivering
lectures
which
were
advertised
and
open
to
the
public.
the
writings
and
lectures
claimed
that
specified
ailments
could
alleviated
by
the
consumption
of
certain
foods
and
food
elements
and
that
the
best
sources
of
these
were
the
products
offered
for
sale
by
the
corporation.
these
products
were
sold
in
booths
and/or
near
the
lecture
halls
and
were
also
available
in
health
food
stores
generally.
respondent
feldten
acted
as
kordel's
assistant
selling
products
at
the
lectures
and
taking
orders
for
shipments
from
detroit.
the
criminal
charges
were
that
as
to
some
of
the
products
certain
of
the
books
and
leaflets
constituted
part
of
the
labeling
and
contained
false
and
misleading
statements.
and
as
to
all
of
the
counts
on
which
respondents
were
convicted,
the
products
which
they
claim
to
be
merely
food
supplements
were
in
fact
drugs
because
they
were
intended
by
the
defendants
to
be
used
for
the
prevention
and
treatment
of
various
diseases
and
health
conditions,
and
that
the
labeling
of
these
products
failed
to
set
forth
adequate
directions
for
the
uses
for
which
they
were
intended
as
required
by
the
act.
since
the
oral
representations
made
in
respondent
kordel's
public
lectures
were
relevant
in
showing
the
uses
for
which
the
products
were
intended,
tape
recordings
of
his
public
lectures
were
introduced
into
evidence
by
the
government
at
the
trial.
at
this
point,
i
believe
a
summary
of
the
relevant
procedural
chronology
will
be
helpful
to
the
court.
the
indictment
in
this
case
was
returned
in
the
summer
of
1963.
previously,
in
june
of
1960,
the
government
had
filed
a
libel
proceeding
under
section
334
of
the
act
to
condemn
quantities
of
the
corporation's
products
as
misbranded.
the
corporation
appeared
as
claimant
in
this
in
rem
proceeding
and
filed
an
answer
denying
the
material
allegations
of
the
complaint.
the
parties
then
served
interrogatories
upon
each
other,
pursuant
to
rule
33
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
the
government's
interrogatories
were
served
in
january
and
april
of
1961
and
sought
among
other
things
detailed
information
about
the
labeling,
testing,
manufacture,
and
composition
of
certain
of
the
products
and
about
kordel's
oral
representations
concerning
the
efficacy
of
these
products
made
during
public
lectures
that
he
gave
in
detroit.
in
late
january
1961,
shortly
after
service
of
the
government's
initial
interrogatories,
the
corporation
received
a
notice
from
the
government
pursuant
to
section
335
of
the
act,
indicating
that
criminal
prosecution
of
the
corporation
and
of
respondents
was
contemplated
in
part
for
the
same
conduct
that
was
the
subject
of
the
libel.
the
corporation
then
in
april
1961
moved
that
the
district
court
extend
its
time
to
respond
to
the
interrogatories
until
final
disposition
of
any
criminal
prosecution
that
might
be
brought.
the
district
court
denied
this
motion
in
june
1961,
holding
that
their
was
no
certainty,
when
or
whether
a
criminal
prosecution
would
be
brought
and
that
there
is
no
prejudice
in
requiring
the
corporation
to
answer
the
interrogatories
since
the
same
information
would
otherwise
become
available
to
the
government
in
any
event
from
the
trial
of
the
libel
proceeding.
pursuant
to
the
court's
order,
the
corporation
then
filed
answers
to
some
of
the
interrogatories
in
september
1961
and
filed
specific
objections
to
others.
in
subsequent
proceedings,
some
of
the
objections
were
sustained
and
some
are
overruled
and
the
government
withdrew
some
of
the
interrogatories.
the
corporation
then
answered
the
remaining
interrogatories
in
september
1962.
respondent
feldten
subscribed
to
all
of
the
corporation's
answers
as
vice
president
and
stated
that
they
were
true
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge
and
belief,
but
that
not
all
of
the
answers
were
known
to
him
personally.
the
libel
proceeding
thereafter
terminated
in
a
consent
decree,
entered
in
november
1962.
in
june
1962,
after
service
of
the
interrogatories
and
after
the
corporation's
initial
answers,
but
prior
to
its
supplemental
answers,
the
food
and
drug
administration
referred
the
matter
to
the
department
of
justice
with
the
recommendation
for
criminal
prosecution.
the
indictment
was
returned
in
august
1963.
in
march
1965,
defendants
in
the
criminal
case
moved
to
suppress
any
evidence
obtained
by
the
government
as
a
result
of
the
corporation's
answers
to
the
interrogatories
in
the
libel
proceeding
or
in
the
alternative
for
a
hearing
to
determine
the
government's
motive
in
bringing
the
civil
action
and
serving
the
interrogatories.
the
district
court
granted
the
alternative
request
for
a
hearing
which
lasted
three
days.
the
transcript
of
the
hearing,
set
forth
in
the
appendix
at
pages
58
to
290,
showed
that
at
the
time
the
civil
case
was
filed,
the
food
and
drug
administration
already
had
evidence
sufficient
in
its
judgment
to
establish
all
the
elements
of
the
criminal
violations,
but
had
not
yet
decided
whether
to
recommend
criminal
prosecution
that
the
agency
determined
that
the
in
rem
seizure
proceeding
should
be
commenced
promptly
in
order
to
prevent
harm
to
the
public
from
continued
distribution
of
the
misbranded
drugs.
and
that
the
interrogatories
were
designed
solely
for
the
purposes
of
the
civil
suit
and
were
submitted
as
they
are
routinely
in
such
suits
in
an
effort
to
narrow
the
issues
for
trial
and
in
the
hope
of
laying
the
foundation
for
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
or
possibly
inducing
the
corporation
to
agree
to
a
consent
decree
by
demonstrating
the
insubstantiality
of
its
case
which
is
what
eventually
happened.
the
district
court
held
on
the
basis
of
this
hearing
that
the
governmental
decisions
to
commence
the
civil
suit
and
to
serve
the
interrogatories
were
made
in
good
faith
and
not
for
the
purpose
of
procuring
evidence
for
a
criminal
prosecution,
and
the
conviction
followed.
and
while
not
disagreeing
with
these
findings,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
respondent's
convictions
on
the
ground
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
of
the
individual
criminal
defendants
have
been
violated
by
requiring
the
corporation
to
answer
the
interrogatories
in
the
civil
proceeding.
the
court
held
that
it
was
constitutionally
insufficient
that
the
government
had
acted
in
good
faith
in
the
civil
proceeding
and
that
none
of
the
answers
to
the
interrogatories
had
been
introduced
into
evidence
in
the
criminal
case.
it
held
that
the
government
must
also
prove
that
it
had
not
in
anyway
utilized
for
purposes
of
the
criminal
case,
information
or
leads
obtained
from
the
answers
to
the
interrogatories.
in
its
initial
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
also
reversed
the
corporation's
conviction,
but
on
the
government's
petition
for
rehearing,
it
modified
its
opinion
in
judgment
so
as
to
affirm
that
conviction
on
the
ground
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
available
under
this
court's
decisions
only
to
natural
persons
and
not
to
a
corporation.
a
petition
for
certiorari
by
the
corporation
was
denied
by
this
court
and
a
petition
for
rehearing
is
presently
pending.
we
contend,
first,
that
the
court
of
appeals
aired
in
holding
that
respondents
privilege
against
self-incrimination
had
been
violated.
neither
of
the
respondents
had
interposed
any
claim
to
the
seized
drugs,
nor
did
either
of
them
have
a
personal
property
interest
in
the
drugs.
neither
of
them
was
party
to
the
civil
action.
neither
of
them
was
obligated
or
required
to
answer
any
of
the
interrogatories
served
on
the
corporation
in
that
proceeding,
and
indeed,
respondent
kordel
supplied
no
answers.
and
respondent
feldten
who
did
submit
answers
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
stated
therein
that
the
truth
of
the
answers
was
not
known
to
him
personally,
so
the
answers
did
not
constitute
an
admission
on
his
part.
and
finally,
neither
respondent
in
anyway
claimed
that
his
privilege
was
being
violated
when
respondent
feldten
submitted
the
answers
on
behalf
of
the
corporation.
the
explicit
language
of
rule
33
dealing
with
interrogatories
and
the
decisions
implementing
the
rule
make
clear
that
when
a
corporation
is
the
party
served
with
interrogatories,
the
corporation
is
obligated
to
appoint
an
agent
who
without
fear
of
self-incrimination
can
furnish
such
requested
information
as
is
available
to
the
corporation.
no
claim
was
made
in
the
libel
proceeding
that
answers
to
any
of
the
questions
were
not
available
to
the
corporation
within
the
meaning
of
the
rule
because
the
only
repositories
of
the
information
were
individuals
who
might
incriminate
themselves
by
disclosing
it.
no
individual
is
required
under
the
rule
to
submit
any
answer
on
the
corporation's
behalf
that
might
tend
to
incriminate
him
personally.
but
the
corporation
which
under
this
court's
decisions
has
no
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
cannot
invoke
the
privilege
of
any
individual
on
its
behalf
remains
obligated
under
the
rule
to
provide
such
requested
information
as
is
available
to
it.
to
the
extent
that
this
obligation
with
the
attendant
risk
that
failure
of
the
corporation
to
comply
might
result
in
a
judgment
forfeiting
the
corporation's
property
constitutes
compulsion.
it
is
compulsion
of
the
corporation
which
has
no
privilege
and
not
of
the
respondents
as
officers
or
shareholders
of
the
corporation.
to
hold
otherwise
would
be
to
overrule
campbell
painting
corporation
against
reid
in
volume
392
u.s.
and
its
predecessor
decisions
because
compulsion
of
a
corporation
to
provide
possibly
incriminating
information
can
always
be
said
to
amount
to
compulsion
of
its
individual
officers
or
shareholders.
they
cannot
utilized
the
corporate
form
of
doing
business
and
yet
claim
a
personal
interest
in
the
corporation's
property
only
for
purposes
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
that
is
the
meaning
of
these
court's
decisions
and
it
was
error
in
our
view
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
hold
to
the
contrary.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
that
that
was
the
issue
in
campbell
painting
corporation
against
reid.
certainly,
the
dissenting
opinion
is
base
on
the
view
that
that
would
have
been
an
appropriate
occasion
for
piercing
the
corporate
veil,
that
was
the
closely
held
corporation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
would
be
a
departure
from
the
holding
that
we've
had
consistently
that
non-personal
entities
do
not
enjoy
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they
certainly
could
have
claimed
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
as
individuals,
even
though
they
were
doing
business
as
a
partnership.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
now,
that
that's
always
a
possible
sanction
under
the
civil
rules.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
could
have
claimed
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
providing
it
was
adequately
founded
as
to
particular
questions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
just
as
respondent
feldten
could
have
claimed
in
this
case.
so
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
to
resolve
the
answering.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
true.
there
might
be
some
question
as
to
whether
the
mere
failure
to
answer
the
interrogatories
and
the
possible
sanctions
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
compulsion.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
certainly
is
not
especially
if
you
have
a
well
founded
claim
of
privilege
as
the
basis
for
your
refusal.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
to
the
best
of
my
belief
it
is
so.
but
as
i
said,
to
the
extent
that
there
was
compulsion
under
the
civil
rules
in
this
case.
it
was
compulsion
on
the
corporation
which
has
no
constitutional
privilege
not
to
be
compelled
to
submitting
incriminating
information,
that's
what
the
court
has
held.
the
rumor
starts
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
your
honor.
we
have
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
an
in
rem
proceeding,
the
corporation
being
the
claimant
was
the
other
party.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
have
also
addressed
our
brief
to
the
broader
concern
which
seems
to
underlie
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
the
question
of
fairness
in
the
administration
by
government
agencies
in
this
and
other
fields
of
their
responsibilities
under
statutes
which
provide
for
the
possibility
of
both
civil
and
criminal
remedies
against
defending
corporations
or
individuals.
our
brief
discusses
the
practices
and
experiences
of
several
agencies
and
articulates
some
general
criteria
which
seem
to
us
to
be
suggested
by
the
leading
cases
in
this
field.
and
we
also
discuss
the
matter
to
which
i
would
now
like
to
turn
our
contention
that
there
was
no
unfairness
in
the
administration
of
the
food
and
drug
laws
in
this
case.
there
was
in
the
first
place
an
important
need
to
protect
the
public
from
harm
here
as
is
frequently
true
in
food
and
drug
or
in
securities
fraud
cases
for
that
matter,
by
commencing
the
civil
proceedings
promptly.
it
was
at
the
very
least
reasonable
for
the
responsible
officials
to
decide
that
this
protection
of
the
public
should
not
await
determination
of
whether
a
criminal
prosecution
would
also
be
appropriate,
let
alone
final
disposition
of
any
criminal
proceeding
that
might
be
instituted.
moreover,
it
was
important
to
proceed
to
judgment
in
the
condemnation
case
because
congress
has
for
good
reasons
referred
to
in
our
brief,
provided
in
section
334
of
the
act
set
forth
at
pages
26
and
27
of
our
brief
that
the
government
must
obtain
a
favorable
judgment
in
a
forfeiture
case
before
it
can
proceed
by
multiple
seizures
against
traditional
quantities
of
the
drugs
being
marketed
elsewhere.
the
interrogatories
served
on
the
corporation
were
found
after
a
hearing
to
have
been
designed
in
good
faith
for
the
legitimate
purpose
of
expediting
the
civil
suit
to
judgment.
the
questions
asked
were
relevant
to
the
issues
in
the
civil
proceeding
even
though,
the
court
of
appeals
seem
to
believed
that
some
of
them
were
not
apparently
because
it
did
not
appreciate
the
bearing
of
respondent
kordel's
oral
representations
of
the
public
lectures
on
the
theory
of
the
government
civil
case,
which
dependent
on
proof
of
the
uses
for
which
the
products
being
marketed
by
the
corporation
were
intended.
in
their
brief,
the
respondents
suggest
a
lack
of
fairness
because
the
government
could
have
utilized
an
alternative
procedure
of
seeking
interim
injunctive
relief
instead
of
the
libel
in
rem.
but
the
same
interrogatories
would
have
been
equally
irrelevant
to
establishing
the
government's
case
in
an
injunctive
proceeding.
moreover,
a
judgment
in
an
in
rem
proceeding
provides
more
effective
protection
of
the
public
because
it
enables
the
government
expeditiously
to
prevent
further
dissemination
of
the
misbranded
drugs
by
anyone
holding
them
for
sale.
a
final
indication
of
the
government's
fairness
in
this
case
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
shortly
after
service
of
the
initial
interrogatories
and
prior
to
the
corporation's
answering
of
them,
the
government
notified
the
corporation
pursuant
to
section
335
of
the
act,
that
criminal
prosecution
of
respondents
and
the
corporation
was
being
considered.
respondents
could
thus
judge
whether
providing
answers
to
the
interrogatories
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
might
tend
to
incriminate
them
and
indeed
the
not
very
revealing
answers
actually
furnished
and
set
forth
in
the
appendix
suggests
that
this
consideration
did
not
escape
their
attention.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
required
by
the
statute
in
section
335,
title
21
your
honor.
we
do
not
rest,
however,
on
a
contention
that
the
government
learned
nothing
from
these
answers,
a
matter
as
to
which
it
is
generally
difficult
to
sustain
a
burden
of
proof
such
as
the
court
of
appeals
here
imposed.
our
position
is
that
because
the
interrogatories
were
used
properly
and
fairly
in
a
good
faith
civil
suit
for
the
legitimate
purposes
of
that
suit,
there
is
no
more
reason
for
preventing
the
government
from
basing
a
criminal
investigation
on
information
learned
thereby,
than
there
would
be
for
preventing
it
from
basing
an
investigation
on
information
legitimately
revealed
in
the
course
of
any
other
good
faith
civil
proceeding
whether
between
private
parties
or
similarly
involving
the
government
as
a
party.
exclusionary
rules
in
their
various
permutations
have
after
all
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
required
only
where
otherwise
relevant
and
competent
evidence
has
been
illegally
or
improperly
obtained.
and
in
our
view,
it
would
ill
serve
the
cause
of
justice
for
the
court
now
to
depart
from
that
principle
and
we
therefore
ask
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
case
has
been
relied
upon
in
litigation.
in
securities
fraud
cases
for
example.
i'd
been
informed
by
the
staff
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
i
think
that
the
food
and
drug
and
the
securities
areas
are
the
ones
in
which
the
problem
is
most
likely
to
arise
because
they
are
the
areas
in
which
the
government
agencies
most
frequently
find
it
necessary
to
proceed
quickly
with
civil
proceedings
before
a
determination
can
be
made
as
to
whether
criminal
prosecution
is
warranted.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
surely,
the
result
would
have
been
justified
if
the
in
rem
proceeding
had
been
brought
in
bad
faith
merely
as
a
device
for
securing
evidence
to
be
used
in
the
criminal
proceeding
or
as
an
improper
instrument
of
criminal
investigation.
i
think
if
the
hearing
had
showed
that
and
there
had
been
a
finding
to
that
effect,
then
the
result
would
have
been
justified,
although,
we
can't
accept
the
rational
that
the
violation
was
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
don't
think
there
is
a
precise
holding
to
that
effect,
but
there
certainly
is
in
the
procter
and
gamble
case
concern
expressed
in
the
opinion.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
need
not
rise
to
that
level
in
order
for
a
relief
to
be
granted
in
a
federal
prosecution
of
course,
but
we
believe
that
it
would
present
a
question
under
the
fifth
amendment's
due
process
clause.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
correct
and
i
should
think
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
--
there
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
amounts
to
a
forum
of
the
due
process
violation
if
the
specified
criminal
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
the
specified
procedures
in
a
criminal
case
are
not
followed
as
they
were
intended
to
be
followed
with
the
safeguards
provided
for
the
securing
of
criminal
evidence
elsewhere
in
the
bill
of
rights.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i'm
not
--
i
don't
think
civil
interrogatories
of
the
sort
provided
for
in
the
civil
rules
would
necessarily
pass
muster
in
the
ordinary
processes
of
criminal
procedure.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
may
will
be
no
constitutional
violation
in
that
situation.
all
we
say
in
our
brief
is
that,
it
seemed
to
us
that
the
due
process
clause
provided
the
more
appropriate
framework
for
considering
this
issues
than
the
self
incrimination
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment
in
this
case.
i
don't
--
we
didn't
mean
to
concede
that
the
due
process
clause
would
be
violated
in
such
a
situation.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
please.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
government
did
not
make
multiple
seizures
eventually
in
this
case
and
in
administering
food
and
drug
laws
the
government
tries
to
avoid
making
multiple
seizures
of
products
that
are
not
harmful
in
themselves.
but
the
availability
of
multiple
seizures
as
a
sanction
after
in
a
misbranding
case,
a
favorable
judgment
is
procured
and
a
forfeiture
proceeding
can
served
as
an
inducement
to
get
a
consent
decree
that
will
eliminate
the
misbranding
which
is
what
we
were
seeking
to
do
in
this
case
and
not
to
forfeit
someone's
property
that
in
the
absence
of
the
misbranding
should
be
allowed
to
be
disseminated.
the
record
does
not
show
to
what
extent
kordel
and
the
corporation
should
be
considered
to
be
altered
egos
in
the
situation
that
was
involved
here,
but
it
does
show
that
the
corporation
never
made
any
claim
that
the
information
requested
was
not
available
to
it
within
the
meaning
of
rule
33
because
only
kordel
knew
the
information
and
he
didn't
want
to
disclose
it.
the
corporation
never
made
that
claim.
thank
you.
