where
do
you
get
the
notions
of
due
process
problem,
constitutional
due
process?
this
is
no
case
that
this
court
has
ever
said
that.
justice

whether
this
is
a
really
an
argument
that
to
the
extent
that
there
maybe
discovery
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
it
maybe,
only
that
discovery
which
the
criminal
rules
permit,
you
can't
use
the
civil
rules
and
they
don't
--
discovery
in
the
criminal

vice

is
that
it?

mr.
friend,
may
i
just
add?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

suppose
there's
been
no
proceeding
against
the
individuals
either
the
civil
case
or
in
the
criminal
case,

the
defendant
in
each,
the
civil
case
or
in
the
criminal
case,
but
the
defendant
in
each,
the
civil
and
the
criminal
case
had
been
the
corporation
only,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
know
it
was,
but
then
--
along
with
the
individuals,

suppose
it
was
a
sole
defendant
in
the
civil
case
and
the
sole
defendant
in
the

under
the

i
guess?

was
a
