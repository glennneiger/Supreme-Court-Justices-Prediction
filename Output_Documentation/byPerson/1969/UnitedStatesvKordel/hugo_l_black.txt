justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
notice
of
the
criminal
proceedings
required
by
the
statute
or
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
rely
on
any
statutory
prohibition
against,
what
you
call
unfair?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
--
didn't
the
court
below
decide
this
on
the
question
of
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
relying
on
the
constitutional
point
or
the
other
or
both?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
your
idea
is
that
that
something
in
court
thinks
is
unfair
is
prohibited
by
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
answered?
justice
hugo
l.
black
kordel
answer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
claim
any
immunity
on
the
ground
of
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
claim
immunity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
didn't
claim
it,
did
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
why
i
was
asking
to
follow,
did
they
claim
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
have
to
decide
this
on
basis
perhaps.
would
you
mind
of
telling
me
upon
what
model
principle
you
rely?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
of
it.
biblical
principles
or
religious
principles
you
rely?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
by
motivation
of
fairness
as
my
brother
says,
that's
fifth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
determining
it
on
fact
is
what
i'm
interested
is
what's
my
standards,
what
guides
me
if
no
constitutional
provision
and
no
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
standard,
when
you
get
to
the
facts,
is
it
a
natural
law
standard,
something
that's
above
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who's
to
define
the
fairness?
justice
hugo
l.
black
through
the
ages
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
[attempt
to
laughter]
[inaudible]
standard,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
noted,
but
decided
on
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
or
both?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
unfair
if
somebody
has
violated
the
law
and
you
have
no
legal
standard
which
says
its
not
unfair,
what's
unfair
about
the
government
trying
to
get
facts
even
by
asking
a
defendant,
you
said
supposed
to
be
to
violate
the
law,
outside
of
the
provision
to
the
constitution,
what's
unfair
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
trilemma?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
of
course
this
--
the
law
doesn't
assume
that
a
man
would
lie?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
would
--
he
is
always
required
to
do
it
if
he
asked
the
question
that
something
when
he's
guilty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
the
only
way
he
can
get
out
would
be
to
lie,
i
guess,
that
will
always
be
the
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
absent
some
special
privilege
granted
him
under
the
constitution,
how
can
we
get
to
what's
fair,
so
as
to
make
it
a
law,
natural
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
different.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
see
that
it
is
because
that
is
a
fifth
amendment
which
we
are
sworn
to
obey
and
enforce.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
agree
with
my
brother
about
the
rules,
but
which
rule?
i've
heard
nothing
viewed
by
any
rules.
which
rules
sets
up
the
standard
of
fairness?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
there
one
which
forbids
what
was
done
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it?
i
never
knew
that
before.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
had
he
asserted
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
denied
his
privilege
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
you
said
they
denied
and
i
base
that
on
the
question,
did
he
assert
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
were
you
his
lawyer
at
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
advise
him
not
to
answer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
didn't
take
a
prosecutor's
word
for
that
order,
representing
the
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
do
you
get
that
stand
because
its
unhoard
to
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
referred
to
this
problem?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
settings
view
of
something
to
happen
in
that
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
i'd
agreed
with
it,
i'm
not
mistaken
it.
justice
hugo

black
was
that

didn't

decided
on

what's
