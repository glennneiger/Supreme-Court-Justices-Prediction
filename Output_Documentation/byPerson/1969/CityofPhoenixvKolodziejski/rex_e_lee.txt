mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
state
of
arizona
may
constitutionally
limit
the
right
to
participate
in
general
obligation
bond
elections
to
real
property
taxpayers
whose
property
in
such
an
election,
the
city
of
phoenix,
will
put
up
as
collateral
security
for
the
repayment
of
the
bond
obligation.
and
whose
property
is
subject
to
lien
of
those
bonds
during
the
life
of
the
bonds.
the
relevant
facts
in
this
particular
case
can
be
simply
stated.
on
june
10,
1969,
there
was
submitted
to
the
real
property
taxpayers
in
the
city
of
phoenix
the
largest
aggregate
of
bond
issues
ever
proposed
by
that
city.
calling
for
a
total
of
$170
million
to
finance
very
badly
needed
improvements
in
the
city
of
phoenix,
urgently
needed
at
that
time
and
even
more
urgently
needed
at
the
present
time.
two
of
these
issues
related
to
general
or
revenue
bond
issues
and
the
other
eight
were
general
obligation
bond
issues.
some
six
days
after
the
election
was
held,
this
court
handed
down
its
decisions
in
kramer
versus
union
free
school
district
and
cipriano
versus
city
of
houma.
the
latter
of
which
held
that
it
was
unconstitutional
to
prohibit
non-property
owners
from
voting
in
a
revenue
bond
election.
according
to
cipriano
applied
its
holding
prospectively
only
and
held
open
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
cipriano
to
general
obligation
bonds.
because
of
the
cloud
which
cipriano
casts
over
the
bonds
of
the
city
of
phoenix,
because
of
the
urgent
need
on
the
part
of
the
city
of
phoenix
for
the
facilities
which
were
to
be
financed
by
these
bonds,
this
suit
was
just
brought
raising
the
question
which
this
court
now
has
before
it.
ms.
kolodziejski,
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
is
an
employee
of
the
leading
investment
banking
firm
in
the
city
of
phoenix
specializing
in
municipal
bonds.
she
owns
no
real
property
and
she
rents
her
living
quarters.
it's
been
stipulated
that
the
real
property
taxes
which
her
landlord
pays
have
a
material
bearing
on
the
amount
of
tax
which
or
in
the
amount
of
rent
which
she
is
charged.
a
question
which
arises
at
the
outset
of
this
case
concerns
the
relevant
test
which
is
to
be
applied
to
determine
the
right
of
the
state
through
its
constitution
and
its
statutes,
to
prescribe
qualifications
under
which
resident
citizens
of
the
city
of
phoenix
can
participate
in
general
obligation
bond
elections.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes
mr.
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
justice
harlan,
in
my
opinion,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
but
no
one
really
knows
the
answer
to
that
question.
the
state
of
arizona
unlike
the
state
of
louisiana
does
not
have
and
so
far
as
i
know
there's
really
only
one
state
that
has
a
statute
exactly
like
the
one
with
louisiana
does
not
have
the
kind
of
statute
that
provides
what
they
call
a
preemption
period
at
the
end
of
which
there
is
no
further
challenge.
arizona
is
really
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
in
this
sense.
the
only
election
challenge
statute
that
exists
is
a
five-day
period
which
was
obviously
intended
to
apply
to
election
of
people,
election
of
officers.
there
is
one
governing
case
which
is
rather
difficult
to
read
and
lawyers
could
differ
on
exactly
what
it
means.
suffice
it
to
say
there
is
serious
question
--
serious
question
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
arizona
whether
there
ever
comes
a
time
that
there's
no
longer
the
opportunity
to
challenge
a
bond
election.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no
sir,
indeed
we're
not.
indeed
we're
not.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes
mr.
justice
white,
in
opinion
we
can.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
all
right,
it
would've
been
june
28,
yes
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
before
this
action
was
filed.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
we
have
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct
and
if
not
filed
within
the
five-day
period.
but
i
reiterate.
we
have
not
raised
that
as
a
defense
and
do
not
wish
to
at
this
time
because
we
need
this
issue
decided
and
we
feel
that
under
as
the
matter
of
arizona
state
law;
number
one,
there
is
a
question
whether
she
did
or
did
not
filed
it
within
the
proper
period
of
time
and
number
two,
in
my
opinion
it's
a
matter
if
this
--
if
this
can
be
waived.
and
we
are
not
relying
on
it.
this
court
over
a
period
of
a
century
has
laid
down
the
very
salutary
rule
and
a
rule
as
reflected
at
least
half-a-dozen
separate
decisions
of
this
court
that
in
determining
which
of
it's
citizens
will
be
allowed
to
vote,
the
states
are
allowed
a
broad
discretion
setting
qualifications
and
determining
the
circumstances
and
the
qualifications
under
which
of
its
resident
citizens
will
be
allowed
to
vote.
there
was
an
exception
carved
out
from
that
general
rule
by
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
kramer
versus
union
free
school
district
and
because
that
exception
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
resolution
of
the
issue
on
this
case,
it
is
important
to
know
the
precise
circumstances
under
which
that
exception
prevails.
therefore,
it
is
important;
i
feel
to
look
at
the
exact
language
of
the
kramer
case.
kramer
spelled
out
that
the
circumstances
under
which
the
exception
to
the
general
rule
applies
is
as
follows:
that
the
broad
latitude
which
usually
accord
to
legislative
judgments
in
this
area
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
institutions
of
state
government
are
fairly
constituted
and
that
when
the
attack
is
an
attack
on
that
very
assumption
and
the
assumption
itself
can
no
longer
serve
as
the
basis
for
presuming
constitutionality.
it
follows,
in
the
view
of
the
kramer
court
that
the
general
rule
upholding
the
judgment
of
legislators
were
reasonable
and
i'm
quoting
now
“does
not
extend
to
decisions
concerning
which
resident
citizens
may
participate
in
the
election
of
legislators
and
other
public
officials”.
and
the
court
was
very
specific
on
this
point
and
reiterated
it
a
number
of
times.
now,
it
is
true
as
justice
stewart
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
kramer
that
it
was
not
limited
to
the
election
of
the
new
york
legislature
which
necessarily
imposed
that
limitation.
nevertheless,
whether
right
or
wrong
in
kramer
and
i
accept
it
as
stare
decisis
whether
right
or
wrong
in
kramer,
the
rationale
of
kramer
was
that
that
limitation
applied
only
when
you're
electing
people.
when
you're
electing
the
general
policy
making
bonds
of
the
state
on
one
of
its
political
subdivisions;
the
state
legislature,
the
school
board
in
kramer,
the
city
council
in
this
case
and
bond
elections
do
not
fit
within
that
exception
category.
therefore,
we
submit
that
the
limitation
involved
in
this
case
must
be
upheld
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
cipriano,
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
an
enigma.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
it's
on
the
books
but
it
did
not
overrule.
in
fact
both
it
and
the
kramer
decision
itself
specifically
said
we
are
not
overruling
lassiter,
pope
versus
williams,
mason
versus
missouri,
and
carrington
versus
rash.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
the
reason
that
you
found
it
impossible
in
the
dissent
in
cipriano
mr.
justice
harlan
is
this.
as
i
read
your
dissent
in
cipriano.
that
under
any
circumstances
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes
and
i
realize
you
filed
a
separate
one
for
other
reasons.
but
mr.
justice
stewart's
and
mr.
justice
black's
dissent
in
that
case
pointed
out
that
under
any
circumstances,
there
was
not
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
exclusion
in
cipriano
and
the
reason
was
that
there's
simply
was
not
a
reasonable
connection
between
exclusion
of
property
orders
in
a
revenue
bonds
election
or
not
that
hangs
upon
the
difference
between
revenue
bonds,
the
general
obligation
bonds
and
i
propose
that
bear
down
very
heavily
on
that
distinction.
the
most
that
can
be
said
about
cipriano,
mr.
justice
harlan
is
that
it
was
very
bare
dictum.
it's
a
pre
curiam
opinion
have
down
the
last
day
of
the
term
and
i
don't
want
to
--
all
i
can
say
is
it
was
simply
a
kind
of
a
wash
over
from
kramer
and
if
you
read
kramer
carefully,
it
should
not
be
made
to
extend
to
any
kind
of
bond
election
and
i
do
not
feel
to
borrow
the
--
borrow
the
phrase
used
by
the
solicitor
general
that
a
century
of
this
court's
decisions
should
be
laid
to
rest
with
nothing
more
than
the
simple
statement
of
compelling
state
interest
in
the
cipriano
opinion
without
any
attempt
to
reconcile
it
with
the
rather
careful
reasoning,
whether
right
or
wrong
that
was
set
forth
in
kramer.
i
turn
then
to
the
discussion
of
the
real
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
recognize
that
mr.
justice
harlan.
all
i'm
saying
is
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
i
do
not
intend
to
reargue
reynolds
versus
sims
mr.
justice
white
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
accepting
reynolds
versus
sims,
accepting
kramer
for
its
reasoning,
accepting
cipriano
versus
the
city
of
houma,
this
is
a
different
case
and
for
reasons
which
i
have
now
about
to
discuss,
the
court
should
go
no
further
than
it
has
gone
in
reynolds
versus
sims,
kramer
and
cipriano
and
i
submit
mr.
justice
harlan
because
i
know
of
your
feelings
about
stare
decisis
that
this
is
a
different
issue,
i
mean
it
does
not
involve
the
same
problem.
the
reason
that
it
doesn't
involve
the
same
problem
rests
upon
the
difference
between
a
revenue
bond
election
on
the
one
hand
and
a
general
obligation
bond
election
on
the
other
hand.
in
a
general
obligation
bond
election,
there
are
two
issues
that
are
submitted
to
the
electorate
that
that
are
relevant
for
present
purposes.
the
first
of
this
is
will
a
city
of
phoenix
obligate
itself,
borrow
money
and
obligate
itself
to
repay
that
money
through
the
impartation
of
taxes,
real
property
taxes
perhaps
supplemented
by
sales
taxes.
that's
one
question.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it's
available,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
designated
that
is
correct.
in
allison
versus
the
city
of
phoenix,
the
arizona
supreme
court
said
that
there
was
an
obligation
only
to
impose
real
property
taxes
were
necessary
but
if
the
city
had
available
some
taxes
from
another
source,
they
could
use
it,
so
i
will
agree
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
property
tax
must
lien
on
the
property.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
they
promise
me
and
by
statute,
the
city
of
phoenix
is
obligated
to
tax
that
property
to
a
sufficient
extent
to
repay
the
bonds.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct
and
to
the
point
of
taking
the
property
and
selling
it
at
a
tax
lien
sale.
and
that
brings
me
to
the
second
issue
in
any
general
obligation
bond
election.
i
will
concede
that
there
might
be
--
mrs.
kolodziejski
may
have
about
the
same
interest
in
the
first
question
because
it's
true
that
maybe
she
is
going
to
participate
to
some
extent
or
another
in
the
payment
of
the
taxes
on
a
year-to-year
basis
if
things
go
well.
but
there
is
a
second
issue
really
in
any
general
obligation
bond
election
and
that
is
this.
will
the
city
of
phoenix
impose
a
lien
by
way
of
collateral
security
for
the
obligation
that
--
for
the
money
that
the
city
of
phoenix
is
borrowing
on
the
property
of
each
individual
property
within
the
city
of
phoenix.
that's
the
real
difference.
the
city
of
phoenix
is
borrowing
money.
it
is
borrowing
it
on
a
secured
obligation,
unlike
revenue
bonds
which
are
unsecured
obligations.
the
city
of
phoenix
is
putting
up
security
and
this
is
at
the
case
with
any
secured
loan,
it
can
get
a
better
interest
rate
if
it
puts
up
security
than
if
it
doesn't
put
up
security.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
someone
else,
precisely.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
this
property
doesn't
belong
to
the
city
of
phoenix.
the
property
that
it's
putting
up
a
security
belongs
to
the
robert
backsteins
and
the
fred
rosenfelds
who
live
within
the
city
of
phoenix.
now,
under
the
normal
course
of
events,
if
all
goes
well
and
we
don't
have
any
pressure
and
the
city
of
phoenix
prosperous,
then
the
city
of
phoenix
will
probably
be
able
to
repay
this
bonus
over
the
entire
21-year
period
from
normal
amount,
our
property
tax
revenues
and
from
the
sales
taxes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
maximum
rate
of
interest,
mr.
justice
black,
under
the
present
statutory
provisions
of
state
of
arizona
is
6%.
probably
be
able
to
repay
it
and
it
means
very
possible
that
the
land
owners
and
the
emily
kolodziejski's
within
the
city
of
phoenix
won't
notice
a
materially
different
impact
from
these
bonds.
but
undeniably,
there
is
a
difference
in
the
risks
that
is
assumed
by
the
property
taxpayers
and
the
non-property
taxpayers.
and
that
the
property
taxpayers
have
themselves,
have
their
property
subjected
to
a
lien.
their
property
is
put
up
as
security
for
what
the
city
of
phoenix
has
borrowed
and
i
think
the
purest
illustration
of
this
lies
in
the
bonds
that
are
referred
to
by
the
amicus
brief,
it's
been
cited
and
been
filed
by
the
city
of
salt
lake.
they
referred
there
to
effort
revenue
bonds
which
are
revenue
bonds
and
which
the
city
anticipates
will
be
paid
from
the
revenues
generated
by
the
airport.
but
the
city
wants
to
issue
these
as
general
obligation
bonds
because
it
can
get
a
better
interest
rate.
anyone
who
has
ever
had
any
experience
as
i'm
sure
all
the
members
of
this
court
have
with
commercial
transaction
knows
that
a
loan
can
be
made
on
conditions
more
favorable
to
the
lender
if
he
puts
up
some
kind
of
security.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
sir
we
do.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
their
money
is
involved,
mr.
justice
marshall
in
the
annual
repayment
or
maybe
involved.
the
difference
between
those
people
in
the
real
property
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
under
the
decision
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
allison
versus
the
city
of
phoenix,
you
can
use
sales
taxes.
you
must
use
property
taxes
necessary.
my
point
is
there
is
not
a
constitutional
difference
or
that
we
don't
need
to
look
that
the
difference
in
source
of
payment
year
by
year
for
the
constitutional
difference.
in
my
view,
the
constitutional
difference
in
here
is
in
the
fact
of
the
risk
that
the
property
owner
is
taking.
now,
if
the
city
of
phoenix
were
saying,
we're
going
to
borrow
money,
we
can
get
a
more
favorable
interest
rate
on
this
money
if
we
put
up
some
security
and
the
security
that
we're
going
to
put
up,
the
cash
surrender
value
of
life
insurance
of
every
citizen
of
the
city
of
phoenix,
the
stock
and
bond
investment
portfolio
of
every
citizen
in
the
city
of
phoenix
and
the
savings
accounts,
then
i
think
we
would
have
a
different
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
being
practical
mr.
justice
--
it'll
be
impractical
and
the
reason
it
would
be
impractical
is
because
those
things
are
made
articles
and
those
things
don't
necessarily
stay
within
the
city
of
phoenix.
the
only
thing
a
value
that
clearly
is
going
to
stay
within
the
city
of
phoenix
over
the
21
period
is
the
land.
now,
in
my
view,
it's
the
same
as
though
we
had
two
joined
obligors
on
a
promissory
note.
only
one
of
them
supplying
security
for
the
note
and
there
is
a
material
difference
between
the
interest
of
those
two
and
whether
the
bonds
are
to
be
sold
or
not.
particularly,
when
you
bear
in
mind
--
particularly,
when
you
bear
in
mind
that
the
election
which
is
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
only
the
second
step
in
a
three-step
process
involved
in
the
issuance
of
bonds.
no
bonds
are
ever
issued
by
any
municipality
in
any
of
the
states
that
have
this
kind
of
restriction.
unless,
first
of
all
the
city
council,
the
school
board
or
someone
determines
that
bonds
should
be
issued.
that
determination
is
made
by
a
body
that
all
of
kramer
has
been
properly
apportioned
and
elected
fairly
by
all
the
people.
the
election
is
the
second
step
and
the
third
step
is
the
actual
issuance
in
sale
which
again
lies
within
the
discretion
of
the
city
council
or
whatever
the
particular
body
maybe.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
don't
have
a
louisiana
problem.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
now,
i'd
like
to
devote
just
a
few
moments
to
the
prospectivity
retroactivity
program
against
--
well,
we
do
feel
and
i
reiterate
that
under
any
conceivable
test,
there
is
a
distinction
between
general
obligation
bonds
and
revenue
bonds;
the
distinction
which
under
this
court's
authorities
renders
the
arizona
law
constitutional.
however,
in
the
event
that
this
court
should
disagree,
i
do
suggest
very
strenuously
that
the
decision
should
be
prospective
only.
and
i
would
like
to
discuss
that
briefly
with
the
court
because
of
the
great
interest
which
has
been
created
and
because
of
the
importance
of
this
matter
also
for
the
city
of
phoenix
and
its
need
for
$170
million
worth
of
financing.
the
court
has
noted
i'm
sure
that
there
have
been
12
different
briefs
filed
from
a
collection
of
about
eight
different
states
across
the
country
whose
provisions
are
similar
to
those
of
arizona.
i
would
simply
submit
that
as
this
court
held
in
cipriano
that
the
various
interest
bearing
on
retroactivity
and
vis-a-vis
prospectivity
indicated
that
the
decision
should
be
prospective
only
are
compounded
in
the
case
of
general
obligation
bonds
and
that
there
is
even
more
reason
why
general
obligations
bonds
or
why
the
decision
in
this
case,
if
the
decision
should
affirm
the
lower
court's
decision
should
be
held
prospective
only
from
the
date
of
this
court's
decision
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
we
hope
mr.
justice
black
that
it
would
hold
them
that
it
would
validate
these
bonds
and
let
me
say
why
i
hope
that
this
would
be
the
case.
may
i
point
out
first
of
all
what
in
the
allen
case
two
terms
ago
which
also
involved
in
election
under
the
‘65
voting
rights
act.
this
court
held
this
decision
prospective
not
only
as
to
other
elections
but
also
as
to
the
election
involved
in
the
particular
case
that
was
at
issue.
the
city
of
phoenix
held
its
election
prior
to
cipriano,
six
days
prior
to
cipriano.
there
are
three
different
questions
that
are
raised
by
this
court's
decision
in
cipriano
and
in
the
allen
case
that
we
feel
are
relevant
and
helpful
in
the
determination
as
to
prospectivity
in
the
instant
case.
in
cipriano,
this
court
mentioned
the
significant
hardships
which
were
the
result
from
a
retroactive
decision.
may
i
simply
point
out
but
not
only
in
this
case
of
the
city
of
phoenix
but
also
others,
the
hardships
are
much
greater
in
the
case
of
general
obligation
bonds
than
they
are
in
the
case
of
revenue
bonds.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes
sir.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
sir
and
i
want
to
discuss
that
because
that
fits
fine
in
louisiana
but
not
in
arizona.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
right
and
it
maybe
mr.
justice
white,
we
just
don't
know
it.
well
let
me
--
let
me
address
myself
to
that
problem.
in
those
states
that
have
a
louisiana-type
statute
and
all
candor
and
i
think
there's
only
one.
then
that
rule
works
fine.
in
those
states
which
do
not
have
that
type
of
statute
and
arizona
does
not,
then
we
would
submit
that
it
should
be
--
that
it
should
be
the
time
of
the
election.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
because
we
don't
know
what
that
is.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
but
that's
not
bond
elections
or
we're
not
sure
whether
that's
bond
election.
let
me
tell
you
why
that's
not
a
good
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
justice
white,
this
is
set
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
have
a
great
battery
of
bond
lawyers.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
they
have
informed
me
and
i
rely
on
their
opinion
that
louisiana
stands
alone
in
so
far
as
that
degree
of
protection.
that
is
a
correction
period
to
say
that
idaho
has
one
that
is
the
closest.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well
you
always
have
the
argument
obliges
and
there's
always
a
possibility
that
there
will
come
a
time
that
it
is
not
an
identifiable
time
such
as
it
was
involved
in
louisiana.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
for
the
date
of
the
election.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
this
court's
decision.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
i
would
hope
for
all
the
states.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
would
--
it
would,
it
would
simply
say
that
in
those
states
as
if
cipriano
was
where
you
have
an
identifiable
time
grid
and
that's
the
point.
where
you
don't
have
it
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
have
two
rules.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
election.
now,
here's
the
reason
that
i
feel
that
it
should
be
the
date
of
the
election.
it
is
after
all
the
election
that
raises
the
constitutional
question.
that's
where
people
either
do
both
or
they
don't.
and
here's
another
reason
mr.
justice
white
why
i
feel
that
it
should
be
the
election
and
answer
to
your
earlier
question.
city
of
phoenix
held
its
election
on
june
the
10th.
cipriano
came
down
on
june
the
16th.
now,
subsequent
to
that
time,
the
city
of
phoenix,
acting
in
perfectly
good
faith
took
steps
to
have
the
question
determined
as
to
whether
it's
bonds
are
good
or
not
and
that's
why
we're
here
and
we're
here
first.
subsequent
to
that
time,
there
were
a
number
of
elections
held.
and
as
you
look
in
the
amici
briefs
that
have
been
filed
at
colorado,
louisiana,
utah
didn't
have
one,
tulsa,
oklahoma,
florida,
idaho
and
texas.
all
of
those
have
held
elections
subsequent
to
cipriano.
the
reason
was
of
course
that
especially
for
schools
and
that's
one
reason
why
it's
even
more
important
to
hold
the
prospective
and
general
obligation
bond
context
and
it
is
in
the
revenue
bond
context.
that's
the
only
way
schools
can
finance
and
schools
simply
can't
wait.
and
that's
why
you
find
so
many
school
elections.
they
have
to
be
held.
but
so
under
and
that
case
is
not
here,
many
of
those
elections
would
be
approved
under
any
rule,
under
the
cipriano
rule,
keep
it
worthwhile
here
simply
because
they
went
ahead,
held
their
election
and
the
state
of
texas
actually
sold
their
bonds.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
reason
why
the
city
of
phoenix
should
be
in
any
or
lesser
position
having
proceeded
in
good
faith
as
the
city
of
phoenix
did
in
orderly
way
to
get
the
question
resolved.
and
really
and
frankly
doing
a
service
to
other
13
states
in
this
country
and
cipriano
where
he
candidly
has
through
him,
the
municipal
financing
community
in
the
13
states
into
chaos.
why
we
should
be
in
any
lesser
position
having
performed
the
service.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
none,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
none,
none.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
the
problem
is
we
can't
get
any
detail
when
to
give
us
an
approving
in
opinion.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
right.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
keep
my
(voice
overlap)
on
that.
if
i'm
right
that
in
non-louisiana-type
states
the
cutoff
date
should
be
the
election
date
then
this
revenue
bond
election
was
before
the
cipriano
decision
came
back
six
days
before.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
only,
only,
other
than
that
we
agreed
that
cipriano
give
its
revenue
bond
elections.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
right.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
hate
to
use
up
my
time
arguing
for
the
other
fellows
but
i
do
feel,
you
see
in
cipriano,
you
said,
you
specifically
held
open
the
question
of
cipriano's
applicability
of
general
obligations.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yeah,
you
also
said
that
cipriano
itself
would
be
prospective
only.
i
simply
submit
and
i
can
do
nothing
more
than
that
these
states
acted
reasonably
in
light
of
both
of
those
involved,
in
light
of
all
those
holdings.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
moments.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
question
on
this
case
is
whether
the
state
of
arizona
may
constitutionally
limit
the
right
to
participate
in
general
obligation
bond
elections
to
real
property
taxpayers
whose
property
in
such
an
election,
the
city
of
phoenix
will
put
up
as
collateral
security
for
the
repayment
of
the
bond
obligation
and
whose
property
is
subject
to
the
lien
of
those
bonds
during
the
life
of
the
bonds.
the
relevant
facts
in
this
particular
case
can
be
simply
stated.
on
june
10,
1969
there
was
submitted
to
the
real
property
taxpayers
in
the
city
of
phoenix,
the
largest
aggregate
of
bond
issues
ever
proposed
by
that
city.
calling
for
a
total
of
a
$170
million
to
finance
very
badly
needed
improvements
in
the
city
of
phoenix
urgently
needed
at
that
time
and
even
more
urgently
needed
at
the
present
time.
two
of
these
issues
related
to
general
or
to
revenue
bond
issues
and
the
other
eight
were
general
obligation
bond
issues.
some
six
days
after
the
election
was
held,
this
court
handed
down
its
decisions
in
kramer
versus
union
free
school
district
and
cipriano
versus
city
of
houma.
the
latter
of
which
held
that
it
was
unconstitutional
to
prohibit
non-property
owners
from
voting
in
a
revenue
bond
election.
court
in
cipriano
applied
its
holding
prospectively
only
and
held
open
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
cipriano
to
general
obligation
bonds.because
of
the
cloud
which
cipriano
cast
over
the
bonds
of
the
city
of
phoenix,
because
of
urgent
need
on
the
part
of
the
city
of
phoenix
for
the
facilities
which
were
to
be
financed
by
these
bonds,
this
suit
was
brought
raising
the
question
which
this
court
now
has
before
it.
ms.
kolodziejski,
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
is
an
employee
of
the
leading
investment
banking
firm
in
the
city
of
phoenix
specializing
in
municipal
bonds.
she
owns
no
real
property
and
she
rents
her
living
quarters.
it's
been
stipulated
that
the
real
property
taxes
which
her
landlord
pays
have
a
material
bearing
on
the
amount
of
tax
which
or
on
the
amount
of
rent
which
she
is
charged.
a
question
which
arises
at
the
outset
of
this
case
concerns
the
relevant
test
which
is
to
be
applied
to
determine
the
right
of
the
state
through
its
constitution
and
its
statutes
to
prescribe
qualifications
under
which
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
don’t
really
understand
what
mr.
rosenfeld
just
said
about
whether
there
is
or
is
not
a
cut
off
period,
but
i
submit
that
my
case
is
now
made
that
there
is
a
confusion
on
this
point
in
the
state
of
arizona.
now
there
certainly
is
at
the
very
least
serious
question
as
to
whether
there
is
and
we
do
not
have
the
type
of
situation
that
exists
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
under
those
circumstances
i
simply
reiterate
my
original
position
and
that
is,
that
the
election
is
the
thing
that
raises
the
constitutional
question
should
be
the
election
that
should
be
the
crucial
date
as
of
which
any
prospective
decision,
any
question
of
prospectivity
should
be
applied.
i
simply
reiterate
that
there
is
no
question,
that
this
does
involve
an
extension
of
kramer
and
cipriano
viewed
in
any
way,
whether
you
take
the
kramer
dictum
or
not.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
whether
kramer
was
a
good
decision
or
not
in
the
first
place,
when
you
extend
that
compelling
state
interest
test
to
real
property
owners
in
a
general
bond
election,
it
involves
the
same
kind
of
judicial
intrusion
into
the
traditional
legislative
field
that
this
court
happily
rejected
in
other
fields
in
nebbia
versus
new
york,
it
should
not
be
done.

rex
e.
lee
mr.
justice
harlan,
in
my
opinion,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
but
no
one
really
knows
the
answer
to
that
question.
the
state
of
arizona
unlike
the
state
of
louisiana
does
not
have
and
so
far
as
i
know
there's
really
only
one
state
that
has
a
statute
exactly
like
the
one
with
louisiana
does
not
have
the
kind
of
statute
that
provides
what
they
call
a
preemption
period
at
the
end
of
which
there
is
no
further
challenge.
arizona
is
really
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
in
this
sense.
the
only
election
challenge
statute
that
exists
is
a
five-day
period
which
was
obviously
intended
to
apply
to
election
of
people,
election
of
officers.
there
is
one
governing
case
which
is
rather
difficult
to
read
and
lawyers
could
differ
on
exactly
what
it
means.
suffice
it
to
say
there
is
serious
question
--
serious
question
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
arizona
whether
there
ever
comes
a
time
that
there's
no
longer
the
opportunity
to
challenge
a
bond
election.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no
sir,
indeed
we're
not.
indeed
we're
not.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes
mr.
justice
white,
in
opinion
we
can.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
all
right,
it
would've
been
june
28,
yes
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
before
this
action
was
filed.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
we
have
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct
and
if
not
filed
within
the
five-day
period.
but
i
reiterate.
we
have
not
raised
that
as
a
defense
and
do
not
wish
to
at
this
time
because
we
need
this
issue
decided
and
we
feel
that
under
as
the
matter
of
arizona
state
law;
number
one,
there
is
a
question
whether
she
did
or
did
not
filed
it
within
the
proper
period
of
time
and
number
two,
in
my
opinion
it's
a
matter
if
this
--
if
this
can
be
waived.
and
we
are
not
relying
on
it.
this
court
over
a
period
of
a
century
has
laid
down
the
very
salutary
rule
and
a
rule
as
reflected
at
least
half-a-dozen
separate
decisions
of
this
court
that
in
determining
which
of
it's
citizens
will
be
allowed
to
vote,
the
states
are
allowed
a
broad
discretion
setting
qualifications
and
determining
the
circumstances
and
the
qualifications
under
which
of
its
resident
citizens
will
be
allowed
to
vote.
there
was
an
exception
carved
out
from
that
general
rule
by
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
kramer
versus
union
free
school
district
and
because
that
exception
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
resolution
of
the
issue
on
this
case,
it
is
important
to
know
the
precise
circumstances
under
which
that
exception
prevails.
therefore,
it
is
important;
i
feel
to
look
at
the
exact
language
of
the
kramer
case.
kramer
spelled
out
that
the
circumstances
under
which
the
exception
to
the
general
rule
applies
is
as
follows:
that
the
broad
latitude
which
usually
accord
to
legislative
judgments
in
this
area
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
institutions
of
state
government
are
fairly
constituted
and
that
when
the
attack
is
an
attack
on
that
very
assumption
and
the
assumption
itself
can
no
longer
serve
as
the
basis
for
presuming
constitutionality.
it
follows,
in
the
view
of
the
kramer
court
that
the
general
rule
upholding
the
judgment
of
legislators
were
reasonable
and
i'm
quoting
now
“does
not
extend
to
decisions
concerning
which
resident
citizens
may
participate
in
the
election
of
legislators
and
other
public
officials”.
and
the
court
was
very
specific
on
this
point
and
reiterated
it
a
number
of
times.
now,
it
is
true
as
justice
stewart
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
kramer
that
it
was
not
limited
to
the
election
of
the
new
york
legislature
which
necessarily
imposed
that
limitation.
nevertheless,
whether
right
or
wrong
in
kramer
and
i
accept
it
as
stare
decisis
whether
right
or
wrong
in
kramer,
the
rationale
of
kramer
was
that
that
limitation
applied
only
when
you're
electing
people.
when
you're
electing
the
general
policy
making
bonds
of
the
state
on
one
of
its
political
subdivisions;
the
state
legislature,
the
school
board
in
kramer,
the
city
council
in
this
case
and
bond
elections
do
not
fit
within
that
exception
category.
therefore,
we
submit
that
the
limitation
involved
in
this
case
must
be
upheld
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
cipriano,
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
an
enigma.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
it's
on
the
books
but
it
did
not
overrule.
in
fact
both
it
and
the
kramer
decision
itself
specifically
said
we
are
not
overruling
lassiter,
pope
versus
williams,
mason
versus
missouri,
and
carrington
versus
rash.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
the
reason
that
you
found
it
impossible
in
the
dissent
in
cipriano
mr.
justice
harlan
is
this.
as
i
read
your
dissent
in
cipriano.
that
under
any
circumstances
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes
and
i
realize
you
filed
a
separate
one
for
other
reasons.
but
mr.
justice
stewart's
and
mr.
justice
black's
dissent
in
that
case
pointed
out
that
under
any
circumstances,
there
was
not
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
exclusion
in
cipriano
and
the
reason
was
that
there's
simply
was
not
a
reasonable
connection
between
exclusion
of
property
orders
in
a
revenue
bonds
election
or
not
that
hangs
upon
the
difference
between
revenue
bonds,
the
general
obligation
bonds
and
i
propose
that
bear
down
very
heavily
on
that
distinction.
the
most
that
can
be
said
about
cipriano,
mr.
justice
harlan
is
that
it
was
very
bare
dictum.
it's
a
pre
curiam
opinion
have
down
the
last
day
of
the
term
and
i
don't
want
to
--
all
i
can
say
is
it
was
simply
a
kind
of
a
wash
over
from
kramer
and
if
you
read
kramer
carefully,
it
should
not
be
made
to
extend
to
any
kind
of
bond
election
and
i
do
not
feel
to
borrow
the
--
borrow
the
phrase
used
by
the
solicitor
general
that
a
century
of
this
court's
decisions
should
be
laid
to
rest
with
nothing
more
than
the
simple
statement
of
compelling
state
interest
in
the
cipriano
opinion
without
any
attempt
to
reconcile
it
with
the
rather
careful
reasoning,
whether
right
or
wrong
that
was
set
forth
in
kramer.
i
turn
then
to
the
discussion
of
the
real
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
recognize
that
mr.
justice
harlan.
all
i'm
saying
is
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
i
do
not
intend
to
reargue
reynolds
versus
sims
mr.
justice
white
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
accepting
reynolds
versus
sims,
accepting
kramer
for
its
reasoning,
accepting
cipriano
versus
the
city
of
houma,
this
is
a
different
case
and
for
reasons
which
i
have
now
about
to
discuss,
the
court
should
go
no
further
than
it
has
gone
in
reynolds
versus
sims,
kramer
and
cipriano
and
i
submit
mr.
justice
harlan
because
i
know
of
your
feelings
about
stare
decisis
that
this
is
a
different
issue,
i
mean
it
does
not
involve
the
same
problem.
the
reason
that
it
doesn't
involve
the
same
problem
rests
upon
the
difference
between
a
revenue
bond
election
on
the
one
hand
and
a
general
obligation
bond
election
on
the
other
hand.
in
a
general
obligation
bond
election,
there
are
two
issues
that
are
submitted
to
the
electorate
that
that
are
relevant
for
present
purposes.
the
first
of
this
is
will
a
city
of
phoenix
obligate
itself,
borrow
money
and
obligate
itself
to
repay
that
money
through
the
impartation
of
taxes,
real
property
taxes
perhaps
supplemented
by
sales
taxes.
that's
one
question.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it's
available,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
designated
that
is
correct.
in
allison
versus
the
city
of
phoenix,
the
arizona
supreme
court
said
that
there
was
an
obligation
only
to
impose
real
property
taxes
were
necessary
but
if
the
city
had
available
some
taxes
from
another
source,
they
could
use
it,
so
i
will
agree
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
property
tax
must
lien
on
the
property.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
they
promise
me
and
by
statute,
the
city
of
phoenix
is
obligated
to
tax
that
property
to
a
sufficient
extent
to
repay
the
bonds.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct
and
to
the
point
of
taking
the
property
and
selling
it
at
a
tax
lien
sale.
and
that
brings
me
to
the
second
issue
in
any
general
obligation
bond
election.
i
will
concede
that
there
might
be
--
mrs.
kolodziejski
may
have
about
the
same
interest
in
the
first
question
because
it's
true
that
maybe
she
is
going
to
participate
to
some
extent
or
another
in
the
payment
of
the
taxes
on
a
year-to-year
basis
if
things
go
well.
but
there
is
a
second
issue
really
in
any
general
obligation
bond
election
and
that
is
this.
will
the
city
of
phoenix
impose
a
lien
by
way
of
collateral
security
for
the
obligation
that
--
for
the
money
that
the
city
of
phoenix
is
borrowing
on
the
property
of
each
individual
property
within
the
city
of
phoenix.
that's
the
real
difference.
the
city
of
phoenix
is
borrowing
money.
it
is
borrowing
it
on
a
secured
obligation,
unlike
revenue
bonds
which
are
unsecured
obligations.
the
city
of
phoenix
is
putting
up
security
and
this
is
at
the
case
with
any
secured
loan,
it
can
get
a
better
interest
rate
if
it
puts
up
security
than
if
it
doesn't
put
up
security.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
someone
else,
precisely.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
this
property
doesn't
belong
to
the
city
of
phoenix.
the
property
that
it's
putting
up
a
security
belongs
to
the
robert
backsteins
and
the
fred
rosenfelds
who
live
within
the
city
of
phoenix.
now,
under
the
normal
course
of
events,
if
all
goes
well
and
we
don't
have
any
pressure
and
the
city
of
phoenix
prosperous,
then
the
city
of
phoenix
will
probably
be
able
to
repay
this
bonus
over
the
entire
21-year
period
from
normal
amount,
our
property
tax
revenues
and
from
the
sales
taxes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
maximum
rate
of
interest,
mr.
justice
black,
under
the
present
statutory
provisions
of
state
of
arizona
is
6%.
probably
be
able
to
repay
it
and
it
means
very
possible
that
the
land
owners
and
the
emily
kolodziejski's
within
the
city
of
phoenix
won't
notice
a
materially
different
impact
from
these
bonds.
but
undeniably,
there
is
a
difference
in
the
risks
that
is
assumed
by
the
property
taxpayers
and
the
non-property
taxpayers.
and
that
the
property
taxpayers
have
themselves,
have
their
property
subjected
to
a
lien.
their
property
is
put
up
as
security
for
what
the
city
of
phoenix
has
borrowed
and
i
think
the
purest
illustration
of
this
lies
in
the
bonds
that
are
referred
to
by
the
amicus
brief,
it's
been
cited
and
been
filed
by
the
city
of
salt
lake.
they
referred
there
to
effort
revenue
bonds
which
are
revenue
bonds
and
which
the
city
anticipates
will
be
paid
from
the
revenues
generated
by
the
airport.
but
the
city
wants
to
issue
these
as
general
obligation
bonds
because
it
can
get
a
better
interest
rate.
anyone
who
has
ever
had
any
experience
as
i'm
sure
all
the
members
of
this
court
have
with
commercial
transaction
knows
that
a
loan
can
be
made
on
conditions
more
favorable
to
the
lender
if
he
puts
up
some
kind
of
security.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
sir
we
do.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
their
money
is
involved,
mr.
justice
marshall
in
the
annual
repayment
or
maybe
involved.
the
difference
between
those
people
in
the
real
property
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
under
the
decision
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
allison
versus
the
city
of
phoenix,
you
can
use
sales
taxes.
you
must
use
property
taxes
necessary.
my
point
is
there
is
not
a
constitutional
difference
or
that
we
don't
need
to
look
that
the
difference
in
source
of
payment
year
by
year
for
the
constitutional
difference.
in
my
view,
the
constitutional
difference
in
here
is
in
the
fact
of
the
risk
that
the
property
owner
is
taking.
now,
if
the
city
of
phoenix
were
saying,
we're
going
to
borrow
money,
we
can
get
a
more
favorable
interest
rate
on
this
money
if
we
put
up
some
security
and
the
security
that
we're
going
to
put
up,
the
cash
surrender
value
of
life
insurance
of
every
citizen
of
the
city
of
phoenix,
the
stock
and
bond
investment
portfolio
of
every
citizen
in
the
city
of
phoenix
and
the
savings
accounts,
then
i
think
we
would
have
a
different
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
being
practical
mr.
justice
--
it'll
be
impractical
and
the
reason
it
would
be
impractical
is
because
those
things
are
made
articles
and
those
things
don't
necessarily
stay
within
the
city
of
phoenix.
the
only
thing
a
value
that
clearly
is
going
to
stay
within
the
city
of
phoenix
over
the
21
period
is
the
land.
now,
in
my
view,
it's
the
same
as
though
we
had
two
joined
obligors
on
a
promissory
note.
only
one
of
them
supplying
security
for
the
note
and
there
is
a
material
difference
between
the
interest
of
those
two
and
whether
the
bonds
are
to
be
sold
or
not.
particularly,
when
you
bear
in
mind
--
particularly,
when
you
bear
in
mind
that
the
election
which
is
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
only
the
second
step
in
a
three-step
process
involved
in
the
issuance
of
bonds.
no
bonds
are
ever
issued
by
any
municipality
in
any
of
the
states
that
have
this
kind
of
restriction.
unless,
first
of
all
the
city
council,
the
school
board
or
someone
determines
that
bonds
should
be
issued.
that
determination
is
made
by
a
body
that
all
of
kramer
has
been
properly
apportioned
and
elected
fairly
by
all
the
people.
the
election
is
the
second
step
and
the
third
step
is
the
actual
issuance
in
sale
which
again
lies
within
the
discretion
of
the
city
council
or
whatever
the
particular
body
maybe.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
don't
have
a
louisiana
problem.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
now,
i'd
like
to
devote
just
a
few
moments
to
the
prospectivity
retroactivity
program
against
--
well,
we
do
feel
and
i
reiterate
that
under
any
conceivable
test,
there
is
a
distinction
between
general
obligation
bonds
and
revenue
bonds;
the
distinction
which
under
this
court's
authorities
renders
the
arizona
law
constitutional.
however,
in
the
event
that
this
court
should
disagree,
i
do
suggest
very
strenuously
that
the
decision
should
be
prospective
only.
and
i
would
like
to
discuss
that
briefly
with
the
court
because
of
the
great
interest
which
has
been
created
and
because
of
the
importance
of
this
matter
also
for
the
city
of
phoenix
and
its
need
for
$170
million
worth
of
financing.
the
court
has
noted
i'm
sure
that
there
have
been
12
different
briefs
filed
from
a
collection
of
about
eight
different
states
across
the
country
whose
provisions
are
similar
to
those
of
arizona.
i
would
simply
submit
that
as
this
court
held
in
cipriano
that
the
various
interest
bearing
on
retroactivity
and
vis-a-vis
prospectivity
indicated
that
the
decision
should
be
prospective
only
are
compounded
in
the
case
of
general
obligation
bonds
and
that
there
is
even
more
reason
why
general
obligations
bonds
or
why
the
decision
in
this
case,
if
the
decision
should
affirm
the
lower
court's
decision
should
be
held
prospective
only
from
the
date
of
this
court's
decision
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
we
hope
mr.
justice
black
that
it
would
hold
them
that
it
would
validate
these
bonds
and
let
me
say
why
i
hope
that
this
would
be
the
case.
may
i
point
out
first
of
all
what
in
the
allen
case
two
terms
ago
which
also
involved
in
election
under
the
‘65
voting
rights
act.
this
court
held
this
decision
prospective
not
only
as
to
other
elections
but
also
as
to
the
election
involved
in
the
particular
case
that
was
at
issue.
the
city
of
phoenix
held
its
election
prior
to
cipriano,
six
days
prior
to
cipriano.
there
are
three
different
questions
that
are
raised
by
this
court's
decision
in
cipriano
and
in
the
allen
case
that
we
feel
are
relevant
and
helpful
in
the
determination
as
to
prospectivity
in
the
instant
case.
in
cipriano,
this
court
mentioned
the
significant
hardships
which
were
the
result
from
a
retroactive
decision.
may
i
simply
point
out
but
not
only
in
this
case
of
the
city
of
phoenix
but
also
others,
the
hardships
are
much
greater
in
the
case
of
general
obligation
bonds
than
they
are
in
the
case
of
revenue
bonds.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes
sir.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
sir
and
i
want
to
discuss
that
because
that
fits
fine
in
louisiana
but
not
in
arizona.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
right
and
it
maybe
mr.
justice
white,
we
just
don't
know
it.
well
let
me
--
let
me
address
myself
to
that
problem.
in
those
states
that
have
a
louisiana-type
statute
and
all
candor
and
i
think
there's
only
one.
then
that
rule
works
fine.
in
those
states
which
do
not
have
that
type
of
statute
and
arizona
does
not,
then
we
would
submit
that
it
should
be
--
that
it
should
be
the
time
of
the
election.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
because
we
don't
know
what
that
is.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
but
that's
not
bond
elections
or
we're
not
sure
whether
that's
bond
election.
let
me
tell
you
why
that's
not
a
good
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
justice
white,
this
is
set
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
have
a
great
battery
of
bond
lawyers.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
they
have
informed
me
and
i
rely
on
their
opinion
that
louisiana
stands
alone
in
so
far
as
that
degree
of
protection.
that
is
a
correction
period
to
say
that
idaho
has
one
that
is
the
closest.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well
you
always
have
the
argument
obliges
and
there's
always
a
possibility
that
there
will
come
a
time
that
it
is
not
an
identifiable
time
such
as
it
was
involved
in
louisiana.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
for
the
date
of
the
election.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
this
court's
decision.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
i
would
hope
for
all
the
states.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
would
--
it
would,
it
would
simply
say
that
in
those
states
as
if
cipriano
was
where
you
have
an
identifiable
time
grid
and
that's
the
point.
where
you
don't
have
it
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
have
two
rules.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
election.
now,
here's
the
reason
that
i
feel
that
it
should
be
the
date
of
the
election.
it
is
after
all
the
election
that
raises
the
constitutional
question.
that's
where
people
either
do
both
or
they
don't.
and
here's
another
reason
mr.
justice
white
why
i
feel
that
it
should
be
the
election
and
answer
to
your
earlier
question.
city
of
phoenix
held
its
election
on
june
the
10th.
cipriano
came
down
on
june
the
16th.
now,
subsequent
to
that
time,
the
city
of
phoenix,
acting
in
perfectly
good
faith
took
steps
to
have
the
question
determined
as
to
whether
it's
bonds
are
good
or
not
and
that's
why
we're
here
and
we're
here
first.
subsequent
to
that
time,
there
were
a
number
of
elections
held.
and
as
you
look
in
the
amici
briefs
that
have
been
filed
at
colorado,
louisiana,
utah
didn't
have
one,
tulsa,
oklahoma,
florida,
idaho
and
texas.
all
of
those
have
held
elections
subsequent
to
cipriano.
the
reason
was
of
course
that
especially
for
schools
and
that's
one
reason
why
it's
even
more
important
to
hold
the
prospective
and
general
obligation
bond
context
and
it
is
in
the
revenue
bond
context.
that's
the
only
way
schools
can
finance
and
schools
simply
can't
wait.
and
that's
why
you
find
so
many
school
elections.
they
have
to
be
held.
but
so
under
and
that
case
is
not
here,
many
of
those
elections
would
be
approved
under
any
rule,
under
the
cipriano
rule,
keep
it
worthwhile
here
simply
because
they
went
ahead,
held
their
election
and
the
state
of
texas
actually
sold
their
bonds.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
reason
why
the
city
of
phoenix
should
be
in
any
or
lesser
position
having
proceeded
in
good
faith
as
the
city
of
phoenix
did
in
orderly
way
to
get
the
question
resolved.
and
really
and
frankly
doing
a
service
to
other
13
states
in
this
country
and
cipriano
where
he
candidly
has
through
him,
the
municipal
financing
community
in
the
13
states
into
chaos.
why
we
should
be
in
any
lesser
position
having
performed
the
service.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
none,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
none,
none.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
the
problem
is
we
can't
get
any
detail
when
to
give
us
an
approving
in
opinion.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
right.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
keep
my
(voice
overlap)
on
that.
if
i'm
right
that
in
non-louisiana-type
states
the
cutoff
date
should
be
the
election
date
then
this
revenue
bond
election
was
before
the
cipriano
decision
came
back
six
days
before.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
only,
only,
other
than
that
we
agreed
that
cipriano
give
its
revenue
bond
elections.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
right.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
hate
to
use
up
my
time
arguing
for
the
other
fellows
but
i
do
feel,
you
see
in
cipriano,
you
said,
you
specifically
held
open
the
question
of
cipriano's
applicability
of
general
obligations.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yeah,
you
also
said
that
cipriano
itself
would
be
prospective
only.
i
simply
submit
and
i
can
do
nothing
more
than
that
these
states
acted
reasonably
in
light
of
both
of
those
involved,
in
light
of
all
those
holdings.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
moments.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
question
on
this
case
is
whether
the
state
of
arizona
may
constitutionally
limit
the
right
to
participate
in
general
obligation
bond
elections
to
real
property
taxpayers
whose
property
in
such
an
election,
the
city
of
phoenix
will
put
up
as
collateral
security
for
the
repayment
of
the
bond
obligation
and
whose
property
is
subject
to
the
lien
of
those
bonds
during
the
life
of
the
bonds.
the
relevant
facts
in
this
particular
case
can
be
simply
stated.
on
june
10,
1969
there
was
submitted
to
the
real
property
taxpayers
in
the
city
of
phoenix,
the
largest
aggregate
of
bond
issues
ever
proposed
by
that
city.
calling
for
a
total
of
a
$170
million
to
finance
very
badly
needed
improvements
in
the
city
of
phoenix
urgently
needed
at
that
time
and
even
more
urgently
needed
at
the
present
time.
two
of
these
issues
related
to
general
or
to
revenue
bond
issues
and
the
other
eight
were
general
obligation
bond
issues.
some
six
days
after
the
election
was
held,
this
court
handed
down
its
decisions
in
kramer
versus
union
free
school
district
and
cipriano
versus
city
of
houma.
the
latter
of
which
held
that
it
was
unconstitutional
to
prohibit
non-property
owners
from
voting
in
a
revenue
bond
election.
court
in
cipriano
applied
its
holding
prospectively
only
and
held
open
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
cipriano
to
general
obligation
bonds.because
of
the
cloud
which
cipriano
cast
over
the
bonds
of
the
city
of
phoenix,
because
of
urgent
need
on
the
part
of
the
city
of
phoenix
for
the
facilities
which
were
to
be
financed
by
these
bonds,
this
suit
was
brought
raising
the
question
which
this
court
now
has
before
it.
ms.
kolodziejski,
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
is
an
employee
of
the
leading
investment
banking
firm
in
the
city
of
phoenix
specializing
in
municipal
bonds.
she
owns
no
real
property
and
she
rents
her
living
quarters.
it's
been
stipulated
that
the
real
property
taxes
which
her
landlord
pays
have
a
material
bearing
on
the
amount
of
tax
which
or
on
the
amount
of
rent
which
she
is
charged.
a
question
which
arises
at
the
outset
of
this
case
concerns
the
relevant
test
which
is
to
be
applied
to
determine
the
right
of
the
state
through
its
constitution
and
its
statutes
to
prescribe
qualifications
under
which
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
don’t
really
understand
what
mr.
rosenfeld
just
said
about
whether
there
is
or
is
not
a
cut
off
period,
but
i
submit
that
my
case
is
now
made
that
there
is
a
confusion
on
this
point
in
the
state
of
arizona.
now
there
certainly
is
at
the
very
least
serious
question
as
to
whether
there
is
and
we
do
not
have
the
type
of
situation
that
exists
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
under
those
circumstances
i
simply
reiterate
my
original
position
and
that
is,
that
the
election
is
the
thing
that
raises
the
constitutional
question
should
be
the
election
that
should
be
the
crucial
date
as
of
which
any
prospective
decision,
any
question
of
prospectivity
should
be
applied.
i
simply
reiterate
that
there
is
no
question,
that
this
does
involve
an
extension
of
kramer
and
cipriano
viewed
in
any
way,
whether
you
take
the
kramer
dictum
or
not.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
whether
kramer
was
a
good
decision
or
not
in
the
first
place,
when
you
extend
that
compelling
state
interest
test
to
real
property
owners
in
a
general
bond
election,
it
involves
the
same
kind
of
judicial
intrusion
into
the
traditional
legislative
field
that
this
court
happily
rejected
in
other
fields
in
nebbia
versus
new
york,
it
should
not
be
done.
