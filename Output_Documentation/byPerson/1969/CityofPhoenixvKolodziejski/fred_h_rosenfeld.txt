mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
behalf
of
miss.kolodziejski,
we
suggest
that
the
court
reject
the
city's
argument
and
affirm
the
decision
of
the
lower
court.
in
relation
to
the
city's
argument
which
is
in
effect
to
limit
both
kramer
and
cipriano
to
the
factual
contents
of
each
case,
we
feel
this
should
be
specifically
rejected.
the
kramer
case
we
will
admit
stated
that
the
rule
would
apply
and
at
the
first
instance,
it
seem
to
say
the
rule
would
apply
to
the
election
of
officials.
however,
it
went
on
and
--
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
another
thing
to
know
in
the
cipriano
decision,
the
court
appeared
as
i
stated
to
take
the
more
rigid
approach
to
that
election
the
dissent,
mr.
black
--
justice
black's
dissent
used
what
i
believed
to
be
the
rational
basis
doctrine
or
the
general
test
for
fourteenth
amendment
--
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
against
the
state
statute.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
in
cipriano.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
excuse
me,
concurring
opinion.
i'm
sorry,
i'm
sorry.
i
apologize.
to
the
effect
that
it
was
held
and
that
the
restriction
was
wholly
irrational.
now,
if
it
was
wholly
irrational,
the
court
--
if
this
is
the
opinion
of
the
minority,
it
could
also
will
have
been
the
opinion
of
the
majority
but
the
majority
opted
for
a
more
specific
test,
so
we
feel
that
in
the
reading
of
kramer
and
cipriano,
there
was
ample
reason
for
us
to
believe
that
the
court
meant
to
apply
this
to
all
special
elections.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
well
then,
then
the
test
would
have
to
apply,
the
test
would
be
are
those
who
are
excluded
substantially
less
interested
and
thus
the
exclusion
promote
a
compelling
state
interest.
it
wouldn't
--
the
neither
case
held
at
the
--
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
oh
no,
i
--
that's
not
my
statement
at
all,
the
test
applies
--
excuse
me
if
i
did.
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
i
apologize.
my
position
is
that
the
test
is
applicable
not
that
all
special
elections
must
be
thrown
over.
i
do
not
espouse
that
position
and
i
don't
think
this
case
is
vehicle
for
anyone
to
espouse
that
positions.
the
test
set
forth
in
the
kramer
case
as
i've
said
is
that
of
substantial
interest
and
the
exclusion
must
promote
a
compelling
state
interest.
in
the
cipriano
case,
this
was
re
affirmed.
in
the
kramer
case
and
also
in
the
footnote
in
the
cipriano
case,
it
appears
to
us
that
the
test
is
so
rigid
that
no
tolerances
whatsoever
are
allowed.
in
the
kramer
case,
it
is
said
that
the
statute
must
be
tailored
so
that
although
and
i
underline
all
are
substantially
less
interested
than
those
who
are
allowed
to
vote.
now,
let
us
apply
this
rule
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
ms.kolodziejski
is
a
lessee.
she
does
not
pay
real
property
taxes,
she
owns
no
real
property.
she
owns
no
personal
property
subject
to
personal
property
taxes.
she
--
however,
it
is
stipulated
that
the
rent
that
she
pays
takes
the
amount
of
the
landlord's
real
property
taxes
into
effect.
therefore,
she
will
be
affected
by
any
increase
in
the
real
property
taxes.
she
also
pays
sales
taxes
which
maybe
used
to
defray
the
bonds
but
it's
not
an
absolute
requirement
that
the
city
continued
to
use
the
sales
taxes
for
the
purpose
of
defraying
these
bonds.
the
facts
also
showed
that
she
is
interested
in
the
city
affairs
of
the
city
of
phoenix
and
that
she
wants
to
vote
in
all
elections.
the
facts
further
showed
that
the
city
has
for
the
recent
years
use
ad
valorem
taxes
to
pay
only
approximately
two
fifths
of
the
annual
debt
service
on
its
general
obligation
bonds.
now,
in
applying
the
substantial
interest
test,
it
is
our
position
that
appellee
is
as
interested
or
is
substantially
interested
in
the
outcome
of
this
election.
there
can
be
no
question
that
she
is
subjectively
interested
in
the
election.
the
facts
bear
that
out.
she
is
also
pecuniarily
interested
in
the
election
in
so
far
as
her
rent
will
be
affected
by
any
increase
in
the
real
property
taxes.
she
is
also
pecuniarily
affected
in
so
far
as
the
money
she
pays
and
excise
taxes
will
go
if
the
city
continues
its
present
policy
to
the
payment
of
the
debt
service
on
the
general
obligation
bonds.
all
residence
of
the
city
of
phoenix
are
affected
by
the
increase
in
any
tax
where
sales
tax
or
real
property
tax
because
it
will
increase
generally
the
cost
of
goods
and
services
within
the
city.
besides
being
interested
both
subjectively
and
pecuniarily,
we
also
feel
that
the
appellee
is
interested
and
has
an
objective
state
in
the
outcome
of
this
election.
we
wish
to
point
out
that
in
all
bond
elections
the
bond
authorization
is
not
the
only
question
before
the
voters.
there
are
other
questions
of
political
import
in
every
bond
election
not
just
the
debt.
the
location
and
type
of
the
improvement
to
be
made
is
an
important
aspect
of
each
bond
election.
obviously,
i
maybe
induced
to
vote
for
the
bond
issue
if
they
are
going
a
place
a
school
or
library
near
my
house.
conversely,
i
maybe
induced
to
vote
against
the
bond
election
if
the
city
intends
to
place
a
sewer
plant
or
abattoir
in
the
direct
vicinity
of
my
house.
this
objective
state
is
one
that
is
shared
by
all
residents
of
the
city,
not
just
by
the
real
property
taxpayers.
in
fact,
this
objective
state
is
affected,
affects
those
people
who
are
excluded
from
this
election.
for
example,
if
you
have
residents
of
slums
or
tenements
which
are
almost
universally
owned
by
absentee
landlords
and
if
this
is
a
dense
population
of
people,
the
political
power
of
the
ballot
to
induce
the
city
to
place
the
municipal
improvements
desired
by
those
voting
is
completely
wiped
out.
i
think
one
of
the,
one
of
the
lessons
of
the
election
cases
and
voting
rights
cases
and
voting
rights
legislation
that
we've
had
over
the
past
decade
is
the
fact
that
the
fruits
of
the
election
gravitate
toward
the
political
power.
here,
we
have
a
situation
which
is
basically
unfair.
a
class
of
people
are
in
a
position
where
they
cannot
exercise
any
power
to
end
and
i
might
say
and
i
will
speak
from
past
experience
in
this
area.
the
general
inclination
on
all
bond
elections
is
to
have
a
purpose
which
will
carry.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
is
to
carry,
that
the
election
will
carry
nine
times
out
of
10
the
purpose
will
be
tailored
toward
those
with
the
voting
power.
now,
if
we
exclude
certain
citizens
from
the
elective
process
and
if
we
exclude
certain
citizens
who
have
a
real
state
in
municipal
improvements
in
the
area
of
schools
it
might
be
said
that
the
renters
in
the
slum
areas
have
an
even
greater
stake
in
the
improvement
or
the
construction
of
new
schools
in
their
area
but
when
we
take
away
this
power
to
this
power
over
the
elective
process,
this
power
of
the
combined
vote
of
the
tenant
class
to
carry
the
election
then
we
have
not
only
affected
the
tenant
class
to
rents,
maybe
through
excise
taxes
but
we
have
affected
their
objective
stake
in
the
election.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
well,
i'm
arguing
the
interest.
i
have
to
say
this,
the
footnote
in
the
kramer
case
seems
to
say
that
interest
meant
the
intent
to
vote.
mr.
justice
stewart's
dissent
said
that
is
what
the
court
is
intending
to
do
that
the
mere
interest
is
an
interest
sufficient
to
take
demand
of
the
polls
to
vote.
but
i
have
tried
to
show
that
the
interest
of
the
tenant
generally
goes
much
further
than
that.
the
interest
of
the
tenant
is
cumulative.
it
is
subjective,
pecuniarily
and
objective.
now,
it
also
is
i
think
of
basic
tenet
of
our
civilization
that
the
rent
is
going
to
be
passed
on
to
the
tenant.
the
appellant
in
the
briefs
state
that
the
appellee
is
unique
in
this
fashion,
in
this
manner.
however,
this
court
in
the
very
recent
case
of
turner
versus
fouche
stated
as
follows.
“it
cannot
be
seriously
urged
that
the
citizen
in
all
other
respects
qualify
to
sit
in
the
school
board
must
own
property
if
he
has
to
participate
responsively
in
the
educational
decisions
without
regard
to
whether
he
is
among
other
things,
a
lessee
who
effectively
pays
property
tax
as
part
of
his
rent.”
i
think
the
court
has
noted
what
to
me
is
a
fact,
a
basic
tenet
of
our
capitalistic
society
that
the
landlord
in
order
to
get
a
fair
return
must
pass
on
the
real
property
taxes
as
a
cost
of
doing
business.
if
the
real
property
taxes
go
up,
his
rents
are
going
to
go
up
accordingly
so
he
can
keep
his
fair
return.
now,
another
thing
in
this
--
another
point
in
this
argument
turns
on
the
fact
that
there
is
not
qualifica
--
there
is
no
quality,
qualitative
approach
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
arizona
or
the
city
of
phoenix
to
determine
just
how
much
real
property
is
necessary
in
order
to
allow
the
elector
to
vote.
it
is
clear
in
my
mind
that
so
long
as
the
man
actively
pays
real
property
taxes,
he
may
own
one
square
inch
of
property
then
will
be
allowed
to
vote.
a
person
leasing
thousands
of
acres
of
property
has
no
standing
to
vote
in
the
same
election.
however,
if
we
are
talking
about
the
mere
tokenism
of
owning
property,
then
we're
in
the
situation
which
this
court
condemned
in
harper
versus
virginia
board
of
elections
where
it
said
that
the
test
of
wealth
is
not
germaned
to
informity
voting.
it
is
easy
to
draw
an
example
where
the
owner
of
real
property
who
would
be
allowed
to
vote
could
have
a
very
small
interest
in
the
property
that
he
owns.
if
for
example
we
have
someone
owning
in
$10.00
worth
of
taxable
property
at
the
assess
level
and
we
have
b
who
owns,
who
leases
a
$10,000.00
home
on
the
assess
evaluation
basis.
we
have
a
situation
where
in
one
month,
b
is
going
to
pay
a
bigger
share
of
this
--
of
the
debt
incurred
for
these
bonds
that
a
will
pay
for
the
entire
term.
however,
b
will
not
be
allowed
to
vote
and
a
will.
it
might
also
be
pointed
out
that
as
i
said,
one
of
the
tenets
of
our
society
is
that
the
entrepreneur
takes
the
risk.
the
lessee
of
real
property
must
live
on
property
owned
by
somebody.
if
it's
a
corporation,
the
corporation
can't
vote;
if
it
is
a
private
source,
the
private
source
could
vote
if
he
lived
within
the
city.
however,
one
of
the
risks
that
this
entrepreneur
takes
is
the
risk
that
he
will
have
a
tenant
throughout
the
life
of
his
building.
in
the
event
that
taxes
are
to
increase,
this
is
part
of
the
risk,
so
it's
no
grave
imposition
on
the
landed
class
to
place
to
remove
the
restriction
that
only
real
property
taxpayers
may
vote.
in
our
brief,
we
cited
some
examples
and
the
only
one
that
i
wish
to
point
out
is
the
situation
where
under
this
particular
type
of
statute,
one
person
could
own
the
entire
municipality.
no
civic
improvement
could
be
made
unless
that
one
person
agreed
to
it.
now,
this
is
not
exactly
too
farfetched.
in
my
in
brief,
i
pointed
out
two
examples
one
were
two
people
carry,
here
the
vote
carry
two
to
nothing,
one
where
the
vote
was
defeated
by
score
of
one
to
nothing.
we
feel
that
the
statute
and
the
constitution
of
the
state
merely
requires
a
token
ownership
of
property
and
that
the
interest
effected
is
in
no
way
relative
to
the
fact
that
the
man
owns
property
because
you
can
pay
more
in
a
lease
in
a
month
than
the
owner
of
a
small
piece
of
property
could
pay
throughout
the
life
of
the
bonds.
token
as
we
feel
should
not
be
a
constitutional
distinction
and
yet
that
is
what
we
have
here.
however,
in
the
event
it
is
shown
that
the
appellee
and
her
class
are
less
interested
than
those
who
are
allowed
to
vote,
this
does
not
carry
the
day
for
the
appellant.
the
appellant
must
also
show
that
the
interest,
the
state
seeks
to
protect
is
compelling.
i
am
at
loss
to
know
the
appellants’
position
on
compelling
state
interest.
i
have
yet
to
learn
the
appellant’s
position
on
the
goal
the
state
articulates.
however,
the
amici
briefs
are
some
help
in
this
area.
the
amici
briefs
boil
this
down
to
the
protection
of
the
land
owner
against
the
piling
of
indiscriminate
debts
by
those
who
do
not
own
the
land.
we
feel
that
the
basic
tenant
of
this
type
of
articulated
goal
is
mere
protectionism
against
the
way
the
population
excluded
might
vote.
this
same
approach
was
denounced
in
carrington
versus
rash
where
the
court
said,
first
the
state
says
it
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
immunizing
its
elections
from
concentrated
balloting
of
military
personnel
whose
collective
voice
may
overwhelm
a
small
community.
fencing
out
from
the
franchise
of
a
sector
of
the
population
because
of
the
way
they
may
vote
is
constitutionally
impermissible.
the
exercise
of
right
is
so
vital
to
the
maintenance
of
democratic
institutions
cannot
constitutionally
be
obliterated
because
of
the
fear
of
the
political
refuse
of
the
group
of
residents.
i
might
note
that
the
fencing
out
section
was
also
sided
in
the
cipriano
case.
that
concludes
my
delivery
insofar
as
the
test
of
the
kramer
and
cipriano
cases
are
concerned.
i
feel
a
few
words
might
necessary
in
relation
to
prospective
application.
it
is
the
statement
of
the
city
that
the
date
of
the
election
should
carry
the
day
in
this
situation.
i
feel
that;
one
i
feel
if
there
is
very
little
question
in
my
own
mind,
personally
that
we
do
have
a
cut
off
date
in
arizona;
it
is
either
the
canvas
date
or
the
five
day
period
thereafter.
different
attorneys
as
mr.
lee
has
stated
have
read
the
morgan
case
in
a
different
way.
it
is
my
feeling
that
there
is
a
legitimate
cut
off
date.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
well,
i
think
there
is
a
cut
off
date
insofar
attacking,
no
there
is
a,
there
is
a
cut
off
date
insofar
as
the
application
of
the
doctrine,
but
if
the
doctrine
is
a
constitutional
and
a
federal
constitutional
doctrine
then
there
is
in
my
mind
no
legislative
action
that
the
state
can
take
to
deprive
the
federal
courts
of
jurisdiction
and
that’s
what,
that’s
--
we
would
be
doing
here.
excuse
me.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
i
don’t
know.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
a
federal
constitutional
challenge.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
that’s
my
position.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
it
could
have
general
statute
limitations.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
you
must
also
note
that
the
five
day
election
contest
period
in
question
is
a
specific
type
of
contest
period.
it
goes
to
the
conduct
of
the
election.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
conduct
of
the
election
per
se.
we
say
what
went
on
afterwards
before
there
was
authority
to
issue
the
bonds
was
sufficient
to
void
the
entire
election.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
well,
the
only
case
that
it
can't
be
applied
is
morgan
versus
the
board
of
supervisor.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
on
a
case
like
this
if
the
authority,
if
the
canvas
i
will
have
to
add
this
if
the
canvas
has
passed.
when
the
canvas
passes
and
the
authority
to
issue
the
bonds
or
in
the
alternative
when
the
five
day
period
passes,
if
that
transpired
before
cipriano,
before
the
cipriano
decision,
then
in
my
mind
those
elections
are
valid
and
they
would
not
be
affected
by
the
cipriano
decision.
on
the
contrary,
if
as
in
the
city
of
phoenix
election
the
authorization
was
not
complete
because
those
are
the
words
used
in
the
last
paragraph
of
cipriano,
the
authorization
was
not
complete.
then
cipriano
would
apply
and
if
cipriano
did
apply
notwithstanding
whatever
cut
off
date,
whether
it
would
be
canvas
or
five
days
after
the
canvas
would
have
no
application
because
we
are
not
talking
about
a
question
for
suit
to
the
election.
thank
you.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
behalf
of
miss.kolodziejski,
we
suggest
that
the
court
reject
the
city's
argument
and
affirm
the
decision
of
the
lower
court.
in
relation
to
the
city's
argument
which
is
in
effect
to
limit
both
kramer
and
cipriano
to
the
factual
contents
of
each
case,
we
feel
this
should
be
specifically
rejected.
the
kramer
case
we
will
admit
stated
that
the
rule
would
apply
and
at
the
first
instance,
it
seem
to
say
the
rule
would
apply
to
the
election
of
officials.
however,
it
went
on
and
--
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
another
thing
to
know
in
the
cipriano
decision,
the
court
appeared
as
i
stated
to
take
the
more
rigid
approach
to
that
election
the
dissent,
mr.
black
--
justice
black's
dissent
used
what
i
believed
to
be
the
rational
basis
doctrine
or
the
general
test
for
fourteenth
amendment
--
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
against
the
state
statute.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
in
cipriano.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
excuse
me,
concurring
opinion.
i'm
sorry,
i'm
sorry.
i
apologize.
to
the
effect
that
it
was
held
and
that
the
restriction
was
wholly
irrational.
now,
if
it
was
wholly
irrational,
the
court
--
if
this
is
the
opinion
of
the
minority,
it
could
also
will
have
been
the
opinion
of
the
majority
but
the
majority
opted
for
a
more
specific
test,
so
we
feel
that
in
the
reading
of
kramer
and
cipriano,
there
was
ample
reason
for
us
to
believe
that
the
court
meant
to
apply
this
to
all
special
elections.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
well
then,
then
the
test
would
have
to
apply,
the
test
would
be
are
those
who
are
excluded
substantially
less
interested
and
thus
the
exclusion
promote
a
compelling
state
interest.
it
wouldn't
--
the
neither
case
held
at
the
--
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
oh
no,
i
--
that's
not
my
statement
at
all,
the
test
applies
--
excuse
me
if
i
did.
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
i
apologize.
my
position
is
that
the
test
is
applicable
not
that
all
special
elections
must
be
thrown
over.
i
do
not
espouse
that
position
and
i
don't
think
this
case
is
vehicle
for
anyone
to
espouse
that
positions.
the
test
set
forth
in
the
kramer
case
as
i've
said
is
that
of
substantial
interest
and
the
exclusion
must
promote
a
compelling
state
interest.
in
the
cipriano
case,
this
was
re
affirmed.
in
the
kramer
case
and
also
in
the
footnote
in
the
cipriano
case,
it
appears
to
us
that
the
test
is
so
rigid
that
no
tolerances
whatsoever
are
allowed.
in
the
kramer
case,
it
is
said
that
the
statute
must
be
tailored
so
that
although
and
i
underline
all
are
substantially
less
interested
than
those
who
are
allowed
to
vote.
now,
let
us
apply
this
rule
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
ms.kolodziejski
is
a
lessee.
she
does
not
pay
real
property
taxes,
she
owns
no
real
property.
she
owns
no
personal
property
subject
to
personal
property
taxes.
she
--
however,
it
is
stipulated
that
the
rent
that
she
pays
takes
the
amount
of
the
landlord's
real
property
taxes
into
effect.
therefore,
she
will
be
affected
by
any
increase
in
the
real
property
taxes.
she
also
pays
sales
taxes
which
maybe
used
to
defray
the
bonds
but
it's
not
an
absolute
requirement
that
the
city
continued
to
use
the
sales
taxes
for
the
purpose
of
defraying
these
bonds.
the
facts
also
showed
that
she
is
interested
in
the
city
affairs
of
the
city
of
phoenix
and
that
she
wants
to
vote
in
all
elections.
the
facts
further
showed
that
the
city
has
for
the
recent
years
use
ad
valorem
taxes
to
pay
only
approximately
two
fifths
of
the
annual
debt
service
on
its
general
obligation
bonds.
now,
in
applying
the
substantial
interest
test,
it
is
our
position
that
appellee
is
as
interested
or
is
substantially
interested
in
the
outcome
of
this
election.
there
can
be
no
question
that
she
is
subjectively
interested
in
the
election.
the
facts
bear
that
out.
she
is
also
pecuniarily
interested
in
the
election
in
so
far
as
her
rent
will
be
affected
by
any
increase
in
the
real
property
taxes.
she
is
also
pecuniarily
affected
in
so
far
as
the
money
she
pays
and
excise
taxes
will
go
if
the
city
continues
its
present
policy
to
the
payment
of
the
debt
service
on
the
general
obligation
bonds.
all
residence
of
the
city
of
phoenix
are
affected
by
the
increase
in
any
tax
where
sales
tax
or
real
property
tax
because
it
will
increase
generally
the
cost
of
goods
and
services
within
the
city.
besides
being
interested
both
subjectively
and
pecuniarily,
we
also
feel
that
the
appellee
is
interested
and
has
an
objective
state
in
the
outcome
of
this
election.
we
wish
to
point
out
that
in
all
bond
elections
the
bond
authorization
is
not
the
only
question
before
the
voters.
there
are
other
questions
of
political
import
in
every
bond
election
not
just
the
debt.
the
location
and
type
of
the
improvement
to
be
made
is
an
important
aspect
of
each
bond
election.
obviously,
i
maybe
induced
to
vote
for
the
bond
issue
if
they
are
going
a
place
a
school
or
library
near
my
house.
conversely,
i
maybe
induced
to
vote
against
the
bond
election
if
the
city
intends
to
place
a
sewer
plant
or
abattoir
in
the
direct
vicinity
of
my
house.
this
objective
state
is
one
that
is
shared
by
all
residents
of
the
city,
not
just
by
the
real
property
taxpayers.
in
fact,
this
objective
state
is
affected,
affects
those
people
who
are
excluded
from
this
election.
for
example,
if
you
have
residents
of
slums
or
tenements
which
are
almost
universally
owned
by
absentee
landlords
and
if
this
is
a
dense
population
of
people,
the
political
power
of
the
ballot
to
induce
the
city
to
place
the
municipal
improvements
desired
by
those
voting
is
completely
wiped
out.
i
think
one
of
the,
one
of
the
lessons
of
the
election
cases
and
voting
rights
cases
and
voting
rights
legislation
that
we've
had
over
the
past
decade
is
the
fact
that
the
fruits
of
the
election
gravitate
toward
the
political
power.
here,
we
have
a
situation
which
is
basically
unfair.
a
class
of
people
are
in
a
position
where
they
cannot
exercise
any
power
to
end
and
i
might
say
and
i
will
speak
from
past
experience
in
this
area.
the
general
inclination
on
all
bond
elections
is
to
have
a
purpose
which
will
carry.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
is
to
carry,
that
the
election
will
carry
nine
times
out
of
10
the
purpose
will
be
tailored
toward
those
with
the
voting
power.
now,
if
we
exclude
certain
citizens
from
the
elective
process
and
if
we
exclude
certain
citizens
who
have
a
real
state
in
municipal
improvements
in
the
area
of
schools
it
might
be
said
that
the
renters
in
the
slum
areas
have
an
even
greater
stake
in
the
improvement
or
the
construction
of
new
schools
in
their
area
but
when
we
take
away
this
power
to
this
power
over
the
elective
process,
this
power
of
the
combined
vote
of
the
tenant
class
to
carry
the
election
then
we
have
not
only
affected
the
tenant
class
to
rents,
maybe
through
excise
taxes
but
we
have
affected
their
objective
stake
in
the
election.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
well,
i'm
arguing
the
interest.
i
have
to
say
this,
the
footnote
in
the
kramer
case
seems
to
say
that
interest
meant
the
intent
to
vote.
mr.
justice
stewart's
dissent
said
that
is
what
the
court
is
intending
to
do
that
the
mere
interest
is
an
interest
sufficient
to
take
demand
of
the
polls
to
vote.
but
i
have
tried
to
show
that
the
interest
of
the
tenant
generally
goes
much
further
than
that.
the
interest
of
the
tenant
is
cumulative.
it
is
subjective,
pecuniarily
and
objective.
now,
it
also
is
i
think
of
basic
tenet
of
our
civilization
that
the
rent
is
going
to
be
passed
on
to
the
tenant.
the
appellant
in
the
briefs
state
that
the
appellee
is
unique
in
this
fashion,
in
this
manner.
however,
this
court
in
the
very
recent
case
of
turner
versus
fouche
stated
as
follows.
“it
cannot
be
seriously
urged
that
the
citizen
in
all
other
respects
qualify
to
sit
in
the
school
board
must
own
property
if
he
has
to
participate
responsively
in
the
educational
decisions
without
regard
to
whether
he
is
among
other
things,
a
lessee
who
effectively
pays
property
tax
as
part
of
his
rent.”
i
think
the
court
has
noted
what
to
me
is
a
fact,
a
basic
tenet
of
our
capitalistic
society
that
the
landlord
in
order
to
get
a
fair
return
must
pass
on
the
real
property
taxes
as
a
cost
of
doing
business.
if
the
real
property
taxes
go
up,
his
rents
are
going
to
go
up
accordingly
so
he
can
keep
his
fair
return.
now,
another
thing
in
this
--
another
point
in
this
argument
turns
on
the
fact
that
there
is
not
qualifica
--
there
is
no
quality,
qualitative
approach
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
arizona
or
the
city
of
phoenix
to
determine
just
how
much
real
property
is
necessary
in
order
to
allow
the
elector
to
vote.
it
is
clear
in
my
mind
that
so
long
as
the
man
actively
pays
real
property
taxes,
he
may
own
one
square
inch
of
property
then
will
be
allowed
to
vote.
a
person
leasing
thousands
of
acres
of
property
has
no
standing
to
vote
in
the
same
election.
however,
if
we
are
talking
about
the
mere
tokenism
of
owning
property,
then
we're
in
the
situation
which
this
court
condemned
in
harper
versus
virginia
board
of
elections
where
it
said
that
the
test
of
wealth
is
not
germaned
to
informity
voting.
it
is
easy
to
draw
an
example
where
the
owner
of
real
property
who
would
be
allowed
to
vote
could
have
a
very
small
interest
in
the
property
that
he
owns.
if
for
example
we
have
someone
owning
in
$10.00
worth
of
taxable
property
at
the
assess
level
and
we
have
b
who
owns,
who
leases
a
$10,000.00
home
on
the
assess
evaluation
basis.
we
have
a
situation
where
in
one
month,
b
is
going
to
pay
a
bigger
share
of
this
--
of
the
debt
incurred
for
these
bonds
that
a
will
pay
for
the
entire
term.
however,
b
will
not
be
allowed
to
vote
and
a
will.
it
might
also
be
pointed
out
that
as
i
said,
one
of
the
tenets
of
our
society
is
that
the
entrepreneur
takes
the
risk.
the
lessee
of
real
property
must
live
on
property
owned
by
somebody.
if
it's
a
corporation,
the
corporation
can't
vote;
if
it
is
a
private
source,
the
private
source
could
vote
if
he
lived
within
the
city.
however,
one
of
the
risks
that
this
entrepreneur
takes
is
the
risk
that
he
will
have
a
tenant
throughout
the
life
of
his
building.
in
the
event
that
taxes
are
to
increase,
this
is
part
of
the
risk,
so
it's
no
grave
imposition
on
the
landed
class
to
place
to
remove
the
restriction
that
only
real
property
taxpayers
may
vote.
in
our
brief,
we
cited
some
examples
and
the
only
one
that
i
wish
to
point
out
is
the
situation
where
under
this
particular
type
of
statute,
one
person
could
own
the
entire
municipality.
no
civic
improvement
could
be
made
unless
that
one
person
agreed
to
it.
now,
this
is
not
exactly
too
farfetched.
in
my
in
brief,
i
pointed
out
two
examples
one
were
two
people
carry,
here
the
vote
carry
two
to
nothing,
one
where
the
vote
was
defeated
by
score
of
one
to
nothing.
we
feel
that
the
statute
and
the
constitution
of
the
state
merely
requires
a
token
ownership
of
property
and
that
the
interest
effected
is
in
no
way
relative
to
the
fact
that
the
man
owns
property
because
you
can
pay
more
in
a
lease
in
a
month
than
the
owner
of
a
small
piece
of
property
could
pay
throughout
the
life
of
the
bonds.
token
as
we
feel
should
not
be
a
constitutional
distinction
and
yet
that
is
what
we
have
here.
however,
in
the
event
it
is
shown
that
the
appellee
and
her
class
are
less
interested
than
those
who
are
allowed
to
vote,
this
does
not
carry
the
day
for
the
appellant.
the
appellant
must
also
show
that
the
interest,
the
state
seeks
to
protect
is
compelling.
i
am
at
loss
to
know
the
appellants’
position
on
compelling
state
interest.
i
have
yet
to
learn
the
appellant’s
position
on
the
goal
the
state
articulates.
however,
the
amici
briefs
are
some
help
in
this
area.
the
amici
briefs
boil
this
down
to
the
protection
of
the
land
owner
against
the
piling
of
indiscriminate
debts
by
those
who
do
not
own
the
land.
we
feel
that
the
basic
tenant
of
this
type
of
articulated
goal
is
mere
protectionism
against
the
way
the
population
excluded
might
vote.
this
same
approach
was
denounced
in
carrington
versus
rash
where
the
court
said,
first
the
state
says
it
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
immunizing
its
elections
from
concentrated
balloting
of
military
personnel
whose
collective
voice
may
overwhelm
a
small
community.
fencing
out
from
the
franchise
of
a
sector
of
the
population
because
of
the
way
they
may
vote
is
constitutionally
impermissible.
the
exercise
of
right
is
so
vital
to
the
maintenance
of
democratic
institutions
cannot
constitutionally
be
obliterated
because
of
the
fear
of
the
political
refuse
of
the
group
of
residents.
i
might
note
that
the
fencing
out
section
was
also
sided
in
the
cipriano
case.
that
concludes
my
delivery
insofar
as
the
test
of
the
kramer
and
cipriano
cases
are
concerned.
i
feel
a
few
words
might
necessary
in
relation
to
prospective
application.
it
is
the
statement
of
the
city
that
the
date
of
the
election
should
carry
the
day
in
this
situation.
i
feel
that;
one
i
feel
if
there
is
very
little
question
in
my
own
mind,
personally
that
we
do
have
a
cut
off
date
in
arizona;
it
is
either
the
canvas
date
or
the
five
day
period
thereafter.
different
attorneys
as
mr.
lee
has
stated
have
read
the
morgan
case
in
a
different
way.
it
is
my
feeling
that
there
is
a
legitimate
cut
off
date.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
well,
i
think
there
is
a
cut
off
date
insofar
attacking,
no
there
is
a,
there
is
a
cut
off
date
insofar
as
the
application
of
the
doctrine,
but
if
the
doctrine
is
a
constitutional
and
a
federal
constitutional
doctrine
then
there
is
in
my
mind
no
legislative
action
that
the
state
can
take
to
deprive
the
federal
courts
of
jurisdiction
and
that’s
what,
that’s
--
we
would
be
doing
here.
excuse
me.

i
don’t
know.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
a
federal
constitutional
challenge.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
that’s
my
position.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
it
could
have
general
statute
limitations.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
you
must
also
note
that
the
five
day
election
contest
period
in
question
is
a
specific
type
of
contest
period.
it
goes
to
the
conduct
of
the
election.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
conduct
of
the
election
per
se.
we
say
what
went
on
afterwards
before
there
was
authority
to
issue
the
bonds
was
sufficient
to
void
the
entire
election.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
well,
the
only
case
that
it
can't
be
applied
is
morgan
versus
the
board
of
supervisor.
mr.
fred
h.
rosenfeld
on
a
case
like
this
if
the
authority,
if
the
canvas
i
will
have
to
add
this
if
the
canvas
has
passed.
when
the
canvas
passes
and
the
authority
to
issue
the
bonds
or
in
the
alternative
when
the
five
day
period
passes,
if
that
transpired
before
cipriano,
before
the
cipriano
decision,
then
in
my
mind
those
elections
are
valid
and
they
would
not
be
affected
by
the
cipriano
decision.
on
the
contrary,
if
as
in
the
city
of
phoenix
election
the
authorization
was
not
complete
because
those
are
the
words
used
in
the
last
paragraph
of
cipriano,
the
authorization
was
not
complete.
then
cipriano
would
apply
and
if
cipriano
did
apply
notwithstanding
whatever
cut
off
date,
whether
it
would
be
canvas
or
five
days
after
the
canvas
would
have
no
application
because
we
are
not
talking
about
a
question
for
suit
to
the
election.
thank
you.
