justice
byron
r.
white
as
suppose
the
state
can
waive
that
you
can.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
conceded
the
five-day
limit
here
(inaudible)
but
it
have
five
days
after
the
canvas,
it
could've
been
july
28
or
june
22.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would've
been
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
well,
the
court
--
whoever
was
excluded
from
the
election
and
if
they
were
included
those
appearances.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
they
really
had
some
time
to
file.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
intend
to
reargue
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
--
are
there
anything
else
that
is
available?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
some
tax
that
is
designated.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
thing
that
comes
to
bondholders
are
property
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
point
do
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
wonder
how
it
helped
you
because
by
your
own
confession
this
election
is
subject
to
challenge.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
should
it
be
within
the
period
of
the
election
is
subject
to
challenge?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
have
to
understand
that
if
somebody
wants
to
challenge
elections
in
arizona,
i
thought
it
was
five
days,
five
days
after
the
canvass.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
--
you
mean,
there
aren't
any
states
that
--
you
mean
it's
more
general
than
not
the
states
have
no
time
limit
on
when
you
can
challenge
a
bond
election.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
wouldn't
think
the
bond
lawyers
would
ever
--
ever
pass
it
or
given
opinion
on
a
bond
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see
them
here,
i
just
wondered.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
does
--
how
does
anyone
know
in
your
state
then
whether
any
bond
is
good,
you
can
apparently
challenge
an
election
forever.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
that
you're
contending
for
mr.
lee?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
--
by
that,
you
mean
if
i
were
to
say
that
you
lose
on
the
other
point
that
we
should
also
say
that
only
as
to
elections
after
the
date
of
this
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah
and
that
this
one
only
for
the
state
of
arizona?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
would
this
effect
to
we
said
in
cipriano,
except
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
have
two
rules.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
about
in
other
states
mr.
lee
that
have
held
elections
since
cipriano.
cipriano
would
at
least
told
them
that
it
wouldn't
have
been
anymore
retroactive
than
cipriano
said
special
election
revenue
obligations
were.
so
the
tendency
of
this
case
--
the
dependency
of
this
case,
really
doesn't
seem
to
--
it
shouldn't
worry
anybody,
that
that
wouldn't
be
anymore
retroactive
than
cipriano.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think
they
would
--
that
recently
holding
elections,
delve
on
why
they
worried
about
with
consequences
of
decision
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
state
has
ever
set
a
time
beyond
which
you
couldn’t
wait
then
raising
a
constitutional
challenge.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that’s
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
i
thought
you
said
after
you
said
that
that
whatever
cut
off
date
there
might
be
for
some
purposes
you
are
perfectly
clear
in
your
mind
that
there
is
not
in
arizona
on
a
case
like
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
suppose
the
state
can
waive
that
you
can.
