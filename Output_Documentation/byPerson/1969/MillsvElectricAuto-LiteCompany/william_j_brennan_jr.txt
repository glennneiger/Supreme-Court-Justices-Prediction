justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
jenner,
you
are
getting
a
trial.
i
don't
--
and
as
i
understood
your
argument
earlier,
you
don't
think
there's
any
restriction
on
--
merely
because
the
court
of
appeals
has
limited
this
to
causation.
i
gather
you
think
you
can
bring
in
everything
you
want
to
bring
in
don't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
your
complaint
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that's
a
correct
view
of
what
you're
going
to
get
your
trial
aren't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
of
course
but
as
i
read
it,
what
they
say
is
we
conclude
that
there
is
an
issue
for
trial
as
the
cause
of
relationship
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
precede
that
--
they
sustained
the
summary
judgment
as
a
guard
to
the
materiality
of
the
misrepresentation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
still
make
under
the
--
as
i
understood
you
earlier
in
the
trial
and
the
cause
of
relationship,
you're
going
to
be
entitled
to
contest
the
materiality
or
misrepresentation
or
did
you
say
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'll
come
back
to
what
i
said
earlier.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
you're
reading
the
court
of
appeals
order
for
a
new
trial
is
not
limiting
you
to
something
called
cause
of
relationship
but
permitting
you
on
in
litigating
the
fact
or
cause
of
relationship
also
litigate
the
issue
of
materiality
aren't
you?
