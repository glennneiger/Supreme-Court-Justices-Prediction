and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
petitioners
are
minority
shareholders
of
the
electric
auto-lite
company
and
they
sued
derivatively
and
as
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
all
other
minority
shareholders
with
respect
to
a
merger
proxy
statement
which
was
mailed
to
the
shareholders
of
electric
auto-lite
in
1963.
the
action
is
brought
against
electric
auto-lite
for
whose
benefit
is
sought
against
mergenthaler,
the
majority
shareholder
which
own
54%
of
auto-lite
stock
and
against
american
manufacturing
company,
the
parent
of
mergenthaler
and
owner
of
1/3
of
its
stock.
the
story
begins
about
two
years
earlier
when
american
manufacturing
company
at
the
top
of
the
pyramid
found
itself
in
a
legal
situation
where
presumptively,
all
of
the
transactions
between
its
affiliates
mergenthaler
and
auto-lite
and
itself
or
any
of
them
had
to
be
subject
possibly
to
investment
company
act
scrutiny
and
regulation.
this
regulation
is
substantive
termed
post
some
very
serious
problems
and
to
avoid
the
risks
of
this
kind
of
regulation,
an
application
was
made
to
the
corporate
regulation
division
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
for
an
exemption.
under
a
provision
which
permits
such
an
exception
of
it
can
be
shown
at
the
business
of
the
parent
is
not
that
of
an
investing
company
but
it
is
primarily
engaged
in
a
business
other
than
that
of
owning
stocks
through
controlled
subsidiaries.
to
show
that
american
was
primarily
engaged
in
the
operation
of
auto-lite
and
its
business
on
a
day-today
basis,
respondents
offered
evidence
of
the
fact
that
mergenthaler
actually
dominated
the
day-to-day
business
of
auto-lite
and
that
this
was
done
in
cooperation
with
american
and
that
this
domination
occurred
through
the
fact
that
all
of
the
directors
--
all
of
the
directors
of
auto-lite
had
been
handpicked.
seven
of
them
were
handpicked
by
mergenthaler
and
seven
of
them
were
direct
nominees
and
four
of
them
had
been
retained
at
sufferance
and
as
the
testimony
went
there
for
the
benefit
of
mergenthaler.
not
for
the
benefit
of
auto-lite
as
they
bought
it
and
thus
showing
the
append
exemption
order.
and
hard
on
the
heels
of
this
exemption
order,
they
issued
the
proxy
statement
with
regard
to
the
proposed
merger
between
mergenthaler
and
auto-lite.
the
proxy
statement
was
completely
silent
about
this
domination
of
the
board
of
directors.
in
fact,
it
was
completely
silent
as
to
any
relationship
between
the
board
of
directors
of
auto-lite
and
mergenthaler
and
american.
and
although
conscious
with
the
fact
that
it
was
necessary
to
disclose
such
relationships,
they
did
disclose
that
there
were
four
directors
of
auto-lite
who
were
common
to
mergenthaler.
and
when
i'm
to
make
the
post
of
representation
that
no
director
has
any
other
interest
direct
or
indirect
in
the
proposed
merger.
in
the
complaint,
the
plaintiffs
have
claimed
that
this
was
an
outcome
of
misrepresentation
which
is
certainly
a
major
nondisclosure.
the
proxy
statement
did
say
that
the
board
of
directors
has
carefully
considered
and
approved
the
terms
of
the
merger
and
recommends
that
the
shareholders
vote
to
approve
the
plan
of
merger.
respondents
despite
the
fact
that
the
suit
was
pending
proceeded
to
consummate
the
merger
and
this
puts
our
situation
here
in
exactly
the
same
context
as
the
situation
in
borak
versus
j.
i.
case
which
this
court
decided
in
1964
and
which
we
say
is
determinative
of
the
issues
here
because
there
too
when
the
merger
was
consummated,
the
people
took
the
risk,
decided
they
go
ahead
knowing
there
was
a
lawsuit
pending
but
nevertheless
went
ahead
with
the
knowledge
of
what
the
claims
of
the
plaintiffs
were.
the
--
since
the
facts
were
undisputed
because
we
have
there
sworn
statements
with
other
case,
the
district
court
took
the
view
that
the
shareholders
were
entitled
to
be
informed
of
these
interrelationships
between
the
board
of
directors
making
the
recommendation
and
the
adversary
in
the
merger
negotiations
and
entered
judgment
--
a
summary
judgment
under
rule
56
(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
several
procedure
which
is
appropriate
where
there
are
no
genuine
issues
of
fact
that
there
have
been
a
violation
through
nondisclosure
of
a
material
fact
or
facts.
the
court
reserved
however
brought
up
the
question
of
cause
or
relationship
and
after
hearings
were
held
on
the
cause
of
relationship
and
it
was
demonstrated
to
the
court
that
this
merger
was
consummated
through
the
use
of
proxies
procured
through
the
unlawful
proxy
statement.
the
court
then
made
a
further
finding
and
entered
a
supplemental
summary
judgment
holding
that
the
issue
of
liability
had
been
established
and
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
the
district
court
on
the
fact
that
there
was
this
material
nondisclosure.
both
courts
has
little
difficulty
in
coming
with
the
conclusion
that
the
failure
to
disclose
this
conflict
of
interest,
the
relationship
with
the
adversary
was
so
material
that
a
violation
had
occurred
so
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
very
carefully
considered
opinion
rule
that
there
had
been
this
violation
of
the
section
14
and
rule
14
(a)
and
rule
14
of
the
regulations
promulgated
by
the
sec.
the
district
court
reserved
all
questions
of
relief
for
further
hearing.
this
under
the
summary
of
judgment
proceedings
of
permissible
to
have
a
judgment
on
liability
first
and
then
after
that
is
disposed
out.
the
appeal
by
the
appellants
of
course
came
immediately
after
the
district
court's
ruling
and
finding.
since
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
had
been
a
violation
and
that
the
facts
not
disclosed
were
material,
the
respondents
here
filed
no
petition
for
certiorari
and
did
not
seek
to
save
that
question
for
review
by
this
court.
when
petitioners
filed
a
petition,
the
respondents
resisted
our
petition,
filed
no
cross
petition,
and
we
believe
that
that
matter
is
therefore
not
pending
before
this
court.
now,
this
court
requested
the
government
to
file
a
brief
as
amicus
and
the
government
in
its
brief
as
will
be
noted
aggress
with
petitioners'
view
as
to
what
issues
are
pending
on
this
certiorari
hearing
and
theirs
are
essentially
the
same
as
our.
that
was
the
government.
the
respondents
of
course
attempt
to
seek
a
review
and
a
weighing
of
the
evidence
by
this
court
and
a
great
length
in
their
brief,
they
argue
what
evidence
it
was
before
the
other
courts.
we
have
not
answered
that
because
we
have
felt
governed
by
the
rules
of
this
court
and
we've
adhered
to
the
question
only
that
on
which
this
court
granted
certiorari.
the
--
now
in
a
separate
portion
of
the
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
deals
with
the
question
of
causation.
and
here
it
rules
that
the
district
court
was
an
error.
although
agreeing
that
the
proxy
statement
caused
the
merger
in
the
sense
that
those
essential
to
the
merger
were
procured
through
the
unlawful
proxy
statement,
the
court
of
appeals
laid
down
a
different
test
of
causation
asking
whether
the
misleading
statement
and
omission
caused
the
submission
of
sufficient
proxies
to
change
the
result
of
the
vote
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
more
exact
question
is
whether
that
particular
misrepresentation
and
are
wrongful
--
material
wrongful
omission
actually
resulted
in
the
votes.
the
cracks
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
lies
at
this
point
toward
the
end.
it's
within
the
last
two
pages
of
the
opinion.
the
material
offered
by
defendants
on
the
merits
of
the
terms
of
merger
suggest
that
it
may
be
possible
for
them
to
satisfy
the
court
by
preponderance
of
probabilities
that
the
merger
would
have
received
a
sufficient
even
if
the
proxy
statement
had
not
been
misleading
in
the
respect
found.
the
petitioners
take
the
position
that
this
kind
of
speculation
or
guesswork
attempt
to
unscramble
the
minds
of
the
5400
minority
shareholders
who
voted
for
the
merger
is
essentially
going
to
be
a
guesswork
proposition.
the
type
of
undertaking
that
courts
do
not
undertake.
there
are
many
decisions
fully
won
by
justice
cardozo
long
ago
in
which
at
common
law,
he
said
that
we
can't
get
in
to
these
nice
speculations
as
to
which
particular
bit
of
information
in
a
series
--
complicated
series
of
facts
affected
the
person's
mind.
but
the
court
of
appeals
was
really
talked
about
here.
they
speak
of
a
footnote
when
they
say
the
court's
finding
question
common
law
is
reliance.
now,
there's
nothing
in
the
borak
case,
there's
nothing
in
the
exchange
act
of
1934
which
is
before
this
court.
there's
nothing
in
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
that
says
anything
about
reliance.
the
--
we
get
down
to
the
question
of
what
is
the
purpose
of
this
legislation.
our
text
must
be
borak
because
we
think
borak
inclusively
disposes
in
this
case.
the
test
is
what
was
the
purpose?
and
the
purpose
was
to
have
an
honest
suffrage.
this
--
the
rule
14
in
section
14
(a)
do
not
say
that
all
under
fair
mergers
are
barred.
this
is
a
disclosure
statute.
it
says
you
must
make
full
disclosure
so
that
there
may
be
a
fully
informed
voting
on
the
question
that
is
presented
in
the
proxy
statement.
if
the
proponents
of
a
merger
want
to
set
out
all
of
the
horrible
things
and
assuming
a
plan
is
just
terribly
untrue
and
they
want
to
set
the
whole
thing
out,
and
they
tell
everything
fully,
there's
no
violation
of
the
statute.
but
the
court
of
appeals
in
interpreting
a
federal
statute
has
gone
the
common
law
standards
and
creates
this
impracticable
standard
as
to
how
you
resolve
what
went
on
in
people's
minds
and
this
assumes
of
course
that
the
stockholders
would
have
voted
for
any
fair
merger.
they
don't
discuss
whether
it
may
be
just
fair,
a
little
bit
fair,
a
whole
light
fair,
overwhelming
of
what.
the
assumption
is
that
the
shareholders
in
guessing
what
went
on
their
minds
and
guessing
and
speculating
what
they
would
do
would
vote
for
a
fair
merger.
well,
that
is
not
consistent
with
known
facts.
people
have
many
reasons
for
voting.
here,
there
were
many
facts
disclosed
as
to
market
value,
the
book
value
--
the
book
value
here
was
$88.00
a
share
and
the
people
were
getting
less
than
75%
of
book
on
this
merger.
and
when
one
analyze
that
the
figures
in
the
proxy
statement
would
realize
they
weren't
even
getting
the
market
value
of
their
auto-lite
shares
because
the
preferred
shares
of
mergenthaler
that
would
be
giving
an
exchange
if
converting
into
common
immediately
would
bring
something
like
$6.00
to
$9.00
less
on
the
market
than
they
would've
had
for
their
shares
of
auto-lite.
but
the
reason
that
the
whole
plan
was
unfair
was
that
the
--
they
were
taking
less
at
less
than
75%
of
book
of
value.
now,
with
all
of
these,
it
is
true
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
the
complaint
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
that
is
not
pending
before
the
court
your
honor
at
this
time.
the
question
of
fairness
we
say
is
petitioners
that
the
issue
of
fairness
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
remedy
and
restitution.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
the
attack
that
the
trial
here,
the
manner
--
the
resolution
of
the
case
below
that
brought
the
case
here
did
not
involve
the
question
of
fairness
at
all.
it
was
a
showing
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
proxy
rules
and
plaintiffs
maintain
that
to
establish
our
cause
of
action
under
borak,
fairness
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
it.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
that's
right.
the
court
of
appeals
injected
this
issue
of
fairness
and
they
setup
a
standard
that
is
the
plan
is
fair,
we
will
assume
that
the
people
would've
voted
for
it
and
if
you,
the
plaintiffs
--
the
petitioners
or
plaintiffs
are
unable
to
establish
that
the
plan
was
unfair
or
putting
the
bird
in
the
other
way,
they
said
that
the
respondents
by
the
burden
of
persuasion
should
demonstrate
that
this
is
fair
if
they
can
and
they
put
in
their
expert
witnesses
and
so
on
and
then
we
put
in
ours.
and
you
get
down
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
at
a
very
lengthy
battle
of
attrition
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
fair.
we
say
that
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
violation
and
on
that,
we
must
stand
or
fall.
either
borak
means
what
it
says
or
it
doesn't
mean
anything.
and
to
borrow
a
common
law
test
of
constructive
fraud
which
the
borak
decision
says
that
the
court
is
trying
to
get
away
from
it
and
congress
was
trying
to
get
away
from.
and
to
inject
it
in
to
a
disclosure
statute
which
involves
a
public
interest
and
fair
--
and
fair
disclosure
to
shareholder
so
they
may
vote
and
know
what
they're
voting
on
without
having
all
the
evils
that
came
prior
to
the
securities
act.
we're
arguing
this
case
exactly
40
years
and
two
days
--
and
two
weeks
to
the
day
after
the
stock
market
price
of
1929
and
all
of
these
investigations,
the
preambles
to
the
securities
act
all
talk
about
what
they're
trying
to
cure.
they're
trying
to
cure
the
secrecy.
they're
trying
to
cure
the
nondisclosures.
they're
not
trying
to
say
let's
have
fair
plan
or
commander
to
make
this
plan
fair.
you
are
commanded
to
make
disclosure
in
a
full
and
honest
disclosure
and
that's
all
that's
involved.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
i
believe
that
it
is
irrelevant
because
congress
in
passing
its
statute
did
not
inject
any
element
of
reliance.
if
we
are
going
to
get
into
questions
of
reliance
and
causation,
then
we
get
into
the
area
speculation
of
what
affects
people's
minds.
and
this
is
something
that
is
almost
impossible
to
unscramble.
how
can
we
got
back
now
years
later
or
if
the
defendants
had
gone
back
immediately
when
they
were
served
with
the
complaint
and
they
know
what
the
facts
where
they
knew
about
this
other
proceeding,
they
knew
about
the
evidence,
they
could've
gone
back
and
resubmit
then
we
would've
have
a
very
easy
disposition
of
the
case.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
i
certainly
do.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
borak
does
not
say
that
that
cause
or
relationship
must
be
tried.
it
msut
be
remembered
that
borak
was
here.
i
was
in
this
case.
borak
was
my
case.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
in
borak,
the
case
came
to
this
court
on
the
pleadings
and
it
was
not
after
a
resolution.
there
was
no
evidence
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
borak
said
that
cause
or
relationship
is
a
matter
for
the
trial
court.
now,
in
order
to
understand
what
the
court
meant
by
that,
you
must
recognize
the
supreme
court
ahs
laid
down
rules
of
federal
procedure.
and
in
the
rules
of
federal
procedure,
you
have
provisions
for
summary
judgment
where
all
the
facts
were
admitted.
we
say
here
the
facts
are
admitted.
the
cause
or
relationship
is
not
some
vague
and
indefinite
thing
that
goes
into
the
question
of
fairness.
we
can
have
restitution
which
will
never
be
over
in
the
case
and
completely
destroyed
the
remedy
for
any
small
shareholder.
and
after
all
these
laws
are
here
to
help
the
small
shareholder
who
has
not
been
able
to
carry
on
this
kind
of
fight.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
as
far
as
remedy
is
concerned,
the
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
we
have
the
alternative.
what
we
want
here
now,
we
want
restitution.
restitution
may
come
in
two
ways.
either
in
kind
or
it
may
come
in
damages.
the
law
of
restitution
goes
back
to
the
16th
century.
it
started
out
with
slaves
case
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
no
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
no
your
honor,
i
don't
want
the
old
pieces
of
paper.
what
i
am
saying
is
this
that
is
the
court
after
a
trial
and
hearing
all
the
relevant
facts
decides
this
merger
should
be
set
aside.
i
don't
want
that
avenue
foreclosed.
we
have
never
said
regardless
of
what
the
defendants
have
in
their
brief
and
unfortunately
we
did
apparently
didn't
make
our
self
that
clear.
when
we
talk
about
restitution
and
that
the
statute
says
that
it
shall
be
void
as
to
the
right,
we're
not
saying
that
that
means
automatic
divestiture.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
that
--
the
congress
set
the
stage
for
restitutionary
remedies.
now,
i'll
give
one
example
to
why
this
is
so
important.
in
sterling
versus
may
flower,
it
was
held
that
when
there
is
a
merger,
the
only
damage
that
the
shareholder
can
get
is
the
merger
of
value.
and
they
decide
that
this
state
court
case
is
a
merger
--
the
merger
of
value
is
the
market
value
so
all
you
can
get
is
the
market
value
of
which
your
shares
would've
sold
on
that
day.
now,
we
say
that
when
the
assets
of
our
company
are
sold
by
the
majority
shareholder
to
himself,
mergenthaler
sold
these
assets
to
itself
because
they
control
the
board
of
directors.
but
we
say
we're
entitled
to
a
restitutionary
measure
of
damages
which
says
we
will
look
at
this.
the
court
is
going
to
look
at
this
as
though
the
merger
hadn't
gone
through.
we're
not
going
to
make
you
take
your
merger
proceeds.
we're
not
going
to
look
at
this
in
the
way
of
an
expectancy
as
though
the
merger
had
gone
through.
we're
going
to
look
at
this
as
though
the
transaction
never
had
taken
place.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
no.that
has
nothing
to
do
with
fairness
your
honor
because
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
no
one
can
speculate
what
the
stock
would
be
worth.
now,
if
the
merger
hadn't
taken
place,
that's
pure
guesswork.
the
measure
of
value
--
one
measure
of
value
is
right
there
on
the
books.
the
mergenthaler
people
say
“oh,
book
value
doesn't
mean
anything.”
that's
what
the
respondents
say
in
their
brief.
but
they
themselves
used
book
value.
they
went
out
in
the
market
and
bought
hundreds
of
thousands
of
share
and
they
set
up
the
excess
over
market
as
an
asset
on
their
books.
and
it
took
$800,000.00
a
year
of
that
excess
value
and
treated
it
as
earnings
and
then
in
triggering
out
these
fantastic
merger
ratio,
they
said,
“look
at
how
much
more
earnings
mergenthaler
has.”
now,
auto-lite
can't
give
nay
consideration
whatsoever
to
the
value
--
to
any
such
values
that
mergenthaler's
value
and
earnings
are
appreciated.
they
had
some
$30
million
or
some
huge
sum
and
they
put
that
in.
they
were
writing
it
off
on
their
books
as
additional
income
earned
by
mergenthaler
and
it
was
nothing
more
than
the
difference
between
what
they
picked
up
the
share
for
the
market
and
the
excess
of
book
value
over.
all
that
we
are
saying
is
we
are
not
asking
for
divestiture
other
than
the
fact
that
we
put
the
prayer
in
our
complaint.
we
are
asking
for
restitutionary
measures
of
damages
as
stated
in
borak.
borak
cites
that
the
departures,
the
independent
shares
under
the
33
act.
it
says
“the
language
here
of
jurisdiction
is
virtually
identical
with
that
in
the
33
securities
act
and
there
you
can
get
restitution.
we
want
the
restitutionary
measure.
we
want
it
as
of
the
moment
before
the
merger
with
all
the
transaction
that
never
occurred,
then
you'll
look
at
the
book
value,
you
look
at
the
liquidating
value,
you'd
look
at
all
these
values
because
if
these
assets,
the
position
of
the
minority
was
sold
those
majority
shareholder
for
less
than
it
was
worth,
then
we
are
entitled
to
get
what
was
really
worth
it
because
all
it
was,
was
a
liquidation
of
the
company.
and
they
sold
out
our
share
and
they
sold
all
the
assets
to
themselves
and
they're
giving
us
what
they
want
to
give
us.
we
think
we're
entitled
to
get
what
they
were
really
worth.
now,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fairness
of
the
plan
whatsoever.
that
plan
never
existed
if
we're
going
to
follow
the
mandate
of
the
congress.
thank
you.
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
mr.
chief
justice
and
your
honors,
the
fairness
as
a
matter
of
a
fair
ratio
of
exchange
in
the
merger
is
not
here.
what
we
seek
is
the
value
of
what
we
gave
up.
we
charge
unfairness
in
the
sense
that
the
respondents
were
unjustly
enriched
not
that
the
ratio
exchange
was
unfair.
it
is
not
mr.
shure
who
wrote
the
act
and
said
that
the
trial
section
shall
be
deemed
as
void,
congress
said
that.
we
are
taking
the
posture
the
congress
places
and
in
says
“the
wrong
doer
shall
not
profit”.
now,
mr.
john
b.
dawson
who's
the
outstanding
authority
of
harvard,
and
the
subject
of
unjust
enrichment
wrote
as
leading
text
on
that
in
1951
and
any
resort
to
that
shows
that
remedies
at
law
that
the
general
attempted
remedy
--
remedy
as
an
equity
tracing
of
assets,
equitable
liens
and
so
on
are
all
different
forms
and
this
is
what
people
who
understand
the
law
of
restitution
are
talking
about
when
they
say
that
you
shall
view
a
transaction
under
the
securities
act
as
void.
it
means
that
you
get
that
not
with
all
the
consequences
of
the
merger
attached
to
it
but
with
the
situation
as
it
existed
before
that.
we
are
contempt
to
let
the
government's
brief
speak
for
itself
as
to
what
they're
referring
is
relevant
to
the
--
to
causation.
the
court
asked
--
mr.
justice
harlan
mr.
jenner
as
to
what
the
differences
were.
there's
a
very
substantial
difference,
they
don't
agree
at
all.
the
government
says
that
the
judgment
should
stand
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
that
we
have
proved
everything
necessary
to
establish
a
cause
of
action
and
that
certain
consequences
flow
from
this.
they
do
say
as
we
agree
that
fairness
of
the
ratio
of
exchange
--
and
i'm
talking
about
the
commission
may
be
relevant
to
one
measure
of
monetary
recovery.
but
the
fairness
that
the
exchange
ratio
is
not
the
only
measure
of
damages
and
the
fairness
of
the
ratio
is
not
relevant
to
unjust
enrichment
causes
of
action
which
is
the
basis
of
the
remedies
under
the
34
act.
borak
points
that
out.
this
commission
said
but
where
ends
here
misleading
aspect
of
situation
--
solicitation
did
not
relate
to
the
terms
of
merger.
the
mislead
stockholders
should
be
entitled
a
monetary
or
other
relief
only
if
the
merger
resulted
in
a
reduction
to
them
of
earnings
or
earnings
potential.
now
what
does
that
mean?
that
means
that
if
we
were
entitled
to
get
2.5
shares
of
preferred
stock
under
the
merger
and
we
only
received
1
8/10,
then
we
ought
to
get
it
or
get
that
in
dollars.
we
are
the
plaintiffs.
we
are
the
ones
who
have
been
injured.
we
brought
the
suit
whose
here
and
we
are
asking
that
all
these
people
who
were
short
changed
on
the
merger
in
anyway
you
look
at
that
proxy
statement,
it
is
inescapable.
what
did
they
do
here?
they
took
$23.00
a
share
of
the
book
value
off
the
bars
and
they
gave
--
we
ended
up
with
$64.00
or
$65.00
a
share,
$64.86
and
the
shareholders
at
mergenthaler
end
up
with
$107.00
a
share
of
book
value.
they
just
handed
it
over
to
the
other
people.
and
we
are
told
here
that
we
just
have
no
remedy
here
if
the
ratio
of
exchange.
we
would
get
into
a
war
here
of
experts.
and
that's
what
the
small
shareholder
is
not
able
to
do.
we
can't
match
the
great
corporation
with
all
of
its
assets
in
that
kind
of
a
war.
congress
envisioned
this
sort
of
thing
and
gave
us
a
short,
quick
remedy
of
restitution
and
said
we
can
have
any
avenue
relief
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
the
only
byway
of
emphasis
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned,
i
believe
that
at
page
18
of
their
brief,
they
did
not
explain
what
they
meant
by
earnings
potential
--
laws
of
earnings
or
earnings
potential.
obviously
looking
at
the
government's
brief
and
looking
at
their
other
writings
that
is
inescapable
if
this
is
unjust
enrichment
we're
talking
about,
then
we
can
get
at
that
unjust
enrichment
at
any
way
that
the
facts
can
be
reached.
and
we
say
that
there
is
no
room
for
any
further
hearing
on
cause
of
relation
hold
that
there
is
this
room
for
remedy.
they
can
--
if
somebody
wants
to
have
a
trial
on
the
question
of
fairness
of
what
we
received,
this
is
an
entirely
different
situation
from
proving
the
fairness.
and
the
government
says
to
us
“you're
not
entitled
at
getting
damages
if
you
didn't
lose
anything.”
but
what
have
the
court
of
appeals
said?
the
court
of
appeals
said
“if
you
don't
get
divestiture
because
it
was
a
fair
plan,
then
you
don't
get
anything,”
except
of
course
as
they
gave
us
a
bill
for
$9000.00
of
cost
for
losing
the
appeal.
they
reversed
and
assessed
the
cost
against
us
when
we
vindicated
the
law
and
we
won
on
the
issue
of
materiality
and
the
fact
of
violation
but
they
say
we
lose
the
case
and
we
get
absolutely
nothing
by
restitution
or
any
other
way.
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
envision
this.
it's
either
restitution
or
it's
either
divestiture
unscrambling
of
merger.
and
if
you
read
their
opinion,
the
language
is
very
clear.
they
give
this
as
a
rationale.
not
every
merger
should
be
set
aside
because
of
a
nondisclosure.
and
as
far
as
i
am
not
going
to
rebut
to
what
mr.
jenner
said
about
whether
there
was
fraud
charge
or
not,
that
matter
is
not
before
this
court
and
we
didn't
do
it
in
our
briefs.
i
don't
think
we
should
spend
our
time
on
it
now.
the
respondents
will
get
a
full
trial
of
the
question
of
what
the
damages
should
be.
we
don't
want
this
court
to
foreclose
us
from
using
any
of
the
means
of
securing
restitution
that
borak
says
that
it
should
be
followed.
and
borak
relied
on
decker
versus
independent
shares
which
also
talked
of
restitution.
and
borak
talked
of
the
section
33
act
which
gives
a
restitutionary
remedy.
now
this
is
what
we're
talking
about
that
the
wrong
doer
gets
no
benefit
whatsoever
out
of
his
wrong
doing.
but
when
i
say
that,
i
don't
mean
you
tear
the
thing
asunder,
i'm
not
interested
in
tearing
apart
corporate
structures,
i
cite
that
as
one
of
the
things
we
ask
for.
you
go
down
the
languages
and
state
your
prayers
in
a
complaint,
you
ask
for
all
the
different
things.
every
lawyer
does
this
in
drafting
a
complaint.
but
as
per
accounting,
ask
for
damages,
we
are
not
trying
to
be
unreasonable.
we
feel
we've
been
very
badly
dealt
with
in
this
on
the
basis
of
the
--
what
we
are
going
to
get
under
the
merger
because
it
is
--
it
was
so
far
below
book
value
and
they
gave
our
book
value
the
other
side.
we
didn't
get
a
fair
market
value
exchange
because
if
we
took
the
preferred
and
convert
in
the
common,
we'd
immediately
suffer
a
loss
of
$6.00
to
$9.00
on
the
basis
of
market
values.
if
you
don't
take
book
and
you
don't
take
market,
what
do
you
take?
you
take
what
your
own
directors
who
are
the
deputies
of
your
adversary
in
the
merger
want
to
give
you.
and
that
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
i
want
to
thank
you
very
much
for
your
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
--
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
petitioners
are
minority
shareholders
of
the
electric
auto-lite
company
and
they
sued
derivatively
and
as
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
all
other
minority
shareholders
with
respect
to
a
merger
proxy
statement
which
was
mailed
to
the
shareholders
of
electric
auto-lite
in
1963.
the
action
is
brought
against
electric
auto-lite
for
whose
benefit
is
sought
against
mergenthaler,
the
majority
shareholder
which
own
54%
of
auto-lite
stock
and
against
american
manufacturing
company,
the
parent
of
mergenthaler
and
owner
of
1/3
of
its
stock.
the
story
begins
about
two
years
earlier
when
american
manufacturing
company
at
the
top
of
the
pyramid
found
itself
in
a
legal
situation
where
presumptively,
all
of
the
transactions
between
its
affiliates
mergenthaler
and
auto-lite
and
itself
or
any
of
them
had
to
be
subject
possibly
to
investment
company
act
scrutiny
and
regulation.
this
regulation
is
substantive
termed
post
some
very
serious
problems
and
to
avoid
the
risks
of
this
kind
of
regulation,
an
application
was
made
to
the
corporate
regulation
division
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
for
an
exemption.
under
a
provision
which
permits
such
an
exception
of
it
can
be
shown
at
the
business
of
the
parent
is
not
that
of
an
investing
company
but
it
is
primarily
engaged
in
a
business
other
than
that
of
owning
stocks
through
controlled
subsidiaries.
to
show
that
american
was
primarily
engaged
in
the
operation
of
auto-lite
and
its
business
on
a
day-today
basis,
respondents
offered
evidence
of
the
fact
that
mergenthaler
actually
dominated
the
day-to-day
business
of
auto-lite
and
that
this
was
done
in
cooperation
with
american
and
that
this
domination
occurred
through
the
fact
that
all
of
the
directors
--
all
of
the
directors
of
auto-lite
had
been
handpicked.
seven
of
them
were
handpicked
by
mergenthaler
and
seven
of
them
were
direct
nominees
and
four
of
them
had
been
retained
at
sufferance
and
as
the
testimony
went
there
for
the
benefit
of
mergenthaler.
not
for
the
benefit
of
auto-lite
as
they
bought
it
and
thus
showing
the
append
exemption
order.
and
hard
on
the
heels
of
this
exemption
order,
they
issued
the
proxy
statement
with
regard
to
the
proposed
merger
between
mergenthaler
and
auto-lite.
the
proxy
statement
was
completely
silent
about
this
domination
of
the
board
of
directors.
in
fact,
it
was
completely
silent
as
to
any
relationship
between
the
board
of
directors
of
auto-lite
and
mergenthaler
and
american.
and
although
conscious
with
the
fact
that
it
was
necessary
to
disclose
such
relationships,
they
did
disclose
that
there
were
four
directors
of
auto-lite
who
were
common
to
mergenthaler.
and
when
i'm
to
make
the
post
of
representation
that
no
director
has
any
other
interest
direct
or
indirect
in
the
proposed
merger.
in
the
complaint,
the
plaintiffs
have
claimed
that
this
was
an
outcome
of
misrepresentation
which
is
certainly
a
major
nondisclosure.
the
proxy
statement
did
say
that
the
board
of
directors
has
carefully
considered
and
approved
the
terms
of
the
merger
and
recommends
that
the
shareholders
vote
to
approve
the
plan
of
merger.
respondents
despite
the
fact
that
the
suit
was
pending
proceeded
to
consummate
the
merger
and
this
puts
our
situation
here
in
exactly
the
same
context
as
the
situation
in
borak
versus
j.
i.
case
which
this
court
decided
in
1964
and
which
we
say
is
determinative
of
the
issues
here
because
there
too
when
the
merger
was
consummated,
the
people
took
the
risk,
decided
they
go
ahead
knowing
there
was
a
lawsuit
pending
but
nevertheless
went
ahead
with
the
knowledge
of
what
the
claims
of
the
plaintiffs
were.
the
--
since
the
facts
were
undisputed
because
we
have
there
sworn
statements
with
other
case,
the
district
court
took
the
view
that
the
shareholders
were
entitled
to
be
informed
of
these
interrelationships
between
the
board
of
directors
making
the
recommendation
and
the
adversary
in
the
merger
negotiations
and
entered
judgment
--
a
summary
judgment
under
rule
56
(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
several
procedure
which
is
appropriate
where
there
are
no
genuine
issues
of
fact
that
there
have
been
a
violation
through
nondisclosure
of
a
material
fact
or
facts.
the
court
reserved
however
brought
up
the
question
of
cause
or
relationship
and
after
hearings
were
held
on
the
cause
of
relationship
and
it
was
demonstrated
to
the
court
that
this
merger
was
consummated
through
the
use
of
proxies
procured
through
the
unlawful
proxy
statement.
the
court
then
made
a
further
finding
and
entered
a
supplemental
summary
judgment
holding
that
the
issue
of
liability
had
been
established
and
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
the
district
court
on
the
fact
that
there
was
this
material
nondisclosure.
both
courts
has
little
difficulty
in
coming
with
the
conclusion
that
the
failure
to
disclose
this
conflict
of
interest,
the
relationship
with
the
adversary
was
so
material
that
a
violation
had
occurred
so
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
very
carefully
considered
opinion
rule
that
there
had
been
this
violation
of
the
section
14
and
rule
14
(a)
and
rule
14
of
the
regulations
promulgated
by
the
sec.
the
district
court
reserved
all
questions
of
relief
for
further
hearing.
this
under
the
summary
of
judgment
proceedings
of
permissible
to
have
a
judgment
on
liability
first
and
then
after
that
is
disposed
out.
the
appeal
by
the
appellants
of
course
came
immediately
after
the
district
court's
ruling
and
finding.
since
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
had
been
a
violation
and
that
the
facts
not
disclosed
were
material,
the
respondents
here
filed
no
petition
for
certiorari
and
did
not
seek
to
save
that
question
for
review
by
this
court.
when
petitioners
filed
a
petition,
the
respondents
resisted
our
petition,
filed
no
cross
petition,
and
we
believe
that
that
matter
is
therefore
not
pending
before
this
court.
now,
this
court
requested
the
government
to
file
a
brief
as
amicus
and
the
government
in
its
brief
as
will
be
noted
aggress
with
petitioners'
view
as
to
what
issues
are
pending
on
this
certiorari
hearing
and
theirs
are
essentially
the
same
as
our.
that
was
the
government.
the
respondents
of
course
attempt
to
seek
a
review
and
a
weighing
of
the
evidence
by
this
court
and
a
great
length
in
their
brief,
they
argue
what
evidence
it
was
before
the
other
courts.
we
have
not
answered
that
because
we
have
felt
governed
by
the
rules
of
this
court
and
we've
adhered
to
the
question
only
that
on
which
this
court
granted
certiorari.
the
--
now
in
a
separate
portion
of
the
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
deals
with
the
question
of
causation.
and
here
it
rules
that
the
district
court
was
an
error.
although
agreeing
that
the
proxy
statement
caused
the
merger
in
the
sense
that
those
essential
to
the
merger
were
procured
through
the
unlawful
proxy
statement,
the
court
of
appeals
laid
down
a
different
test
of
causation
asking
whether
the
misleading
statement
and
omission
caused
the
submission
of
sufficient
proxies
to
change
the
result
of
the
vote
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
more
exact
question
is
whether
that
particular
misrepresentation
and
are
wrongful
--
material
wrongful
omission
actually
resulted
in
the
votes.
the
cracks
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
lies
at
this
point
toward
the
end.
it's
within
the
last
two
pages
of
the
opinion.
the
material
offered
by
defendants
on
the
merits
of
the
terms
of
merger
suggest
that
it
may
be
possible
for
them
to
satisfy
the
court
by
preponderance
of
probabilities
that
the
merger
would
have
received
a
sufficient
even
if
the
proxy
statement
had
not
been
misleading
in
the
respect
found.
the
petitioners
take
the
position
that
this
kind
of
speculation
or
guesswork
attempt
to
unscramble
the
minds
of
the
5400
minority
shareholders
who
voted
for
the
merger
is
essentially
going
to
be
a
guesswork
proposition.
the
type
of
undertaking
that
courts
do
not
undertake.
there
are
many
decisions
fully
won
by
justice
cardozo
long
ago
in
which
at
common
law,
he
said
that
we
can't
get
in
to
these
nice
speculations
as
to
which
particular
bit
of
information
in
a
series
--
complicated
series
of
facts
affected
the
person's
mind.
but
the
court
of
appeals
was
really
talked
about
here.
they
speak
of
a
footnote
when
they
say
the
court's
finding
question
common
law
is
reliance.
now,
there's
nothing
in
the
borak
case,
there's
nothing
in
the
exchange
act
of
1934
which
is
before
this
court.
there's
nothing
in
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
that
says
anything
about
reliance.
the
--
we
get
down
to
the
question
of
what
is
the
purpose
of
this
legislation.
our
text
must
be
borak
because
we
think
borak
inclusively
disposes
in
this
case.
the
test
is
what
was
the
purpose?
and
the
purpose
was
to
have
an
honest
suffrage.
this
--
the
rule
14
in
section
14
(a)
do
not
say
that
all
under
fair
mergers
are
barred.
this
is
a
disclosure
statute.
it
says
you
must
make
full
disclosure
so
that
there
may
be
a
fully
informed
voting
on
the
question
that
is
presented
in
the
proxy
statement.
if
the
proponents
of
a
merger
want
to
set
out
all
of
the
horrible
things
and
assuming
a
plan
is
just
terribly
untrue
and
they
want
to
set
the
whole
thing
out,
and
they
tell
everything
fully,
there's
no
violation
of
the
statute.
but
the
court
of
appeals
in
interpreting
a
federal
statute
has
gone
the
common
law
standards
and
creates
this
impracticable
standard
as
to
how
you
resolve
what
went
on
in
people's
minds
and
this
assumes
of
course
that
the
stockholders
would
have
voted
for
any
fair
merger.
they
don't
discuss
whether
it
may
be
just
fair,
a
little
bit
fair,
a
whole
light
fair,
overwhelming
of
what.
the
assumption
is
that
the
shareholders
in
guessing
what
went
on
their
minds
and
guessing
and
speculating
what
they
would
do
would
vote
for
a
fair
merger.
well,
that
is
not
consistent
with
known
facts.
people
have
many
reasons
for
voting.
here,
there
were
many
facts
disclosed
as
to
market
value,
the
book
value
--
the
book
value
here
was
$88.00
a
share
and
the
people
were
getting
less
than
75%
of
book
on
this
merger.
and
when
one
analyze
that
the
figures
in
the
proxy
statement
would
realize
they
weren't
even
getting
the
market
value
of
their
auto-lite
shares
because
the
preferred
shares
of
mergenthaler
that
would
be
giving
an
exchange
if
converting
into
common
immediately
would
bring
something
like
$6.00
to
$9.00
less
on
the
market
than
they
would've
had
for
their
shares
of
auto-lite.
but
the
reason
that
the
whole
plan
was
unfair
was
that
the
--
they
were
taking
less
at
less
than
75%
of
book
of
value.
now,
with
all
of
these,
it
is
true
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
the
complaint
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
that
is
not
pending
before
the
court
your
honor
at
this
time.
the
question
of
fairness
we
say
is
petitioners
that
the
issue
of
fairness
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
remedy
and
restitution.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
the
attack
that
the
trial
here,
the
manner
--
the
resolution
of
the
case
below
that
brought
the
case
here
did
not
involve
the
question
of
fairness
at
all.
it
was
a
showing
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
proxy
rules
and
plaintiffs
maintain
that
to
establish
our
cause
of
action
under
borak,
fairness
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
it.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
that's
right.
the
court
of
appeals
injected
this
issue
of
fairness
and
they
setup
a
standard
that
is
the
plan
is
fair,
we
will
assume
that
the
people
would've
voted
for
it
and
if
you,
the
plaintiffs
--
the
petitioners
or
plaintiffs
are
unable
to
establish
that
the
plan
was
unfair
or
putting
the
bird
in
the
other
way,
they
said
that
the
respondents
by
the
burden
of
persuasion
should
demonstrate
that
this
is
fair
if
they
can
and
they
put
in
their
expert
witnesses
and
so
on
and
then
we
put
in
ours.
and
you
get
down
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
at
a
very
lengthy
battle
of
attrition
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
fair.
we
say
that
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
violation
and
on
that,
we
must
stand
or
fall.
either
borak
means
what
it
says
or
it
doesn't
mean
anything.
and
to
borrow
a
common
law
test
of
constructive
fraud
which
the
borak
decision
says
that
the
court
is
trying
to
get
away
from
it
and
congress
was
trying
to
get
away
from.
and
to
inject
it
in
to
a
disclosure
statute
which
involves
a
public
interest
and
fair
--
and
fair
disclosure
to
shareholder
so
they
may
vote
and
know
what
they're
voting
on
without
having
all
the
evils
that
came
prior
to
the
securities
act.
we're
arguing
this
case
exactly
40
years
and
two
days
--
and
two
weeks
to
the
day
after
the
stock
market
price
of
1929
and
all
of
these
investigations,
the
preambles
to
the
securities
act
all
talk
about
what
they're
trying
to
cure.
they're
trying
to
cure
the
secrecy.
they're
trying
to
cure
the
nondisclosures.
they're
not
trying
to
say
let's
have
fair
plan
or
commander
to
make
this
plan
fair.
you
are
commanded
to
make
disclosure
in
a
full
and
honest
disclosure
and
that's
all
that's
involved.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
i
believe
that
it
is
irrelevant
because
congress
in
passing
its
statute
did
not
inject
any
element
of
reliance.
if
we
are
going
to
get
into
questions
of
reliance
and
causation,
then
we
get
into
the
area
speculation
of
what
affects
people's
minds.
and
this
is
something
that
is
almost
impossible
to
unscramble.
how
can
we
got
back
now
years
later
or
if
the
defendants
had
gone
back
immediately
when
they
were
served
with
the
complaint
and
they
know
what
the
facts
where
they
knew
about
this
other
proceeding,
they
knew
about
the
evidence,
they
could've
gone
back
and
resubmit
then
we
would've
have
a
very
easy
disposition
of
the
case.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
i
certainly
do.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
borak
does
not
say
that
that
cause
or
relationship
must
be
tried.
it
msut
be
remembered
that
borak
was
here.
i
was
in
this
case.
borak
was
my
case.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
in
borak,
the
case
came
to
this
court
on
the
pleadings
and
it
was
not
after
a
resolution.
there
was
no
evidence
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
borak
said
that
cause
or
relationship
is
a
matter
for
the
trial
court.
now,
in
order
to
understand
what
the
court
meant
by
that,
you
must
recognize
the
supreme
court
ahs
laid
down
rules
of
federal
procedure.
and
in
the
rules
of
federal
procedure,
you
have
provisions
for
summary
judgment
where
all
the
facts
were
admitted.
we
say
here
the
facts
are
admitted.
the
cause
or
relationship
is
not
some
vague
and
indefinite
thing
that
goes
into
the
question
of
fairness.
we
can
have
restitution
which
will
never
be
over
in
the
case
and
completely
destroyed
the
remedy
for
any
small
shareholder.
and
after
all
these
laws
are
here
to
help
the
small
shareholder
who
has
not
been
able
to
carry
on
this
kind
of
fight.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
as
far
as
remedy
is
concerned,
the
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
we
have
the
alternative.
what
we
want
here
now,
we
want
restitution.
restitution
may
come
in
two
ways.
either
in
kind
or
it
may
come
in
damages.
the
law
of
restitution
goes
back
to
the
16th
century.
it
started
out
with
slaves
case
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
no
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
no
your
honor,
i
don't
want
the
old
pieces
of
paper.
what
i
am
saying
is
this
that
is
the
court
after
a
trial
and
hearing
all
the
relevant
facts
decides
this
merger
should
be
set
aside.
i
don't
want
that
avenue
foreclosed.
we
have
never
said
regardless
of
what
the
defendants
have
in
their
brief
and
unfortunately
we
did
apparently
didn't
make
our
self
that
clear.
when
we
talk
about
restitution
and
that
the
statute
says
that
it
shall
be
void
as
to
the
right,
we're
not
saying
that
that
means
automatic
divestiture.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
that
--
the
congress
set
the
stage
for
restitutionary
remedies.
now,
i'll
give
one
example
to
why
this
is
so
important.
in
sterling
versus
may
flower,
it
was
held
that
when
there
is
a
merger,
the
only
damage
that
the
shareholder
can
get
is
the
merger
of
value.
and
they
decide
that
this
state
court
case
is
a
merger
--
the
merger
of
value
is
the
market
value
so
all
you
can
get
is
the
market
value
of
which
your
shares
would've
sold
on
that
day.
now,
we
say
that
when
the
assets
of
our
company
are
sold
by
the
majority
shareholder
to
himself,
mergenthaler
sold
these
assets
to
itself
because
they
control
the
board
of
directors.
but
we
say
we're
entitled
to
a
restitutionary
measure
of
damages
which
says
we
will
look
at
this.
the
court
is
going
to
look
at
this
as
though
the
merger
hadn't
gone
through.
we're
not
going
to
make
you
take
your
merger
proceeds.
we're
not
going
to
look
at
this
in
the
way
of
an
expectancy
as
though
the
merger
had
gone
through.
we're
going
to
look
at
this
as
though
the
transaction
never
had
taken
place.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
no.that
has
nothing
to
do
with
fairness
your
honor
because
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
no
one
can
speculate
what
the
stock
would
be
worth.
now,
if
the
merger
hadn't
taken
place,
that's
pure
guesswork.
the
measure
of
value
--
one
measure
of
value
is
right
there
on
the
books.
the
mergenthaler
people
say
“oh,
book
value
doesn't
mean
anything.”
that's
what
the
respondents
say
in
their
brief.
but
they
themselves
used
book
value.
they
went
out
in
the
market
and
bought
hundreds
of
thousands
of
share
and
they
set
up
the
excess
over
market
as
an
asset
on
their
books.
and
it
took
$800,000.00
a
year
of
that
excess
value
and
treated
it
as
earnings
and
then
in
triggering
out
these
fantastic
merger
ratio,
they
said,
“look
at
how
much
more
earnings
mergenthaler
has.”
now,
auto-lite
can't
give
nay
consideration
whatsoever
to
the
value
--
to
any
such
values
that
mergenthaler's
value
and
earnings
are
appreciated.
they
had
some
$30
million
or
some
huge
sum
and
they
put
that
in.
they
were
writing
it
off
on
their
books
as
additional
income
earned
by
mergenthaler
and
it
was
nothing
more
than
the
difference
between
what
they
picked
up
the
share
for
the
market
and
the
excess
of
book
value
over.
all
that
we
are
saying
is
we
are
not
asking
for
divestiture
other
than
the
fact
that
we
put
the
prayer
in
our
complaint.
we
are
asking
for
restitutionary
measures
of
damages
as
stated
in
borak.
borak
cites
that
the
departures,
the
independent
shares
under
the
33
act.
it
says
“the
language
here
of
jurisdiction
is
virtually
identical
with
that
in
the
33
securities
act
and
there
you
can
get
restitution.
we
want
the
restitutionary
measure.
we
want
it
as
of
the
moment
before
the
merger
with
all
the
transaction
that
never
occurred,
then
you'll
look
at
the
book
value,
you
look
at
the
liquidating
value,
you'd
look
at
all
these
values
because
if
these
assets,
the
position
of
the
minority
was
sold
those
majority
shareholder
for
less
than
it
was
worth,
then
we
are
entitled
to
get
what
was
really
worth
it
because
all
it
was,
was
a
liquidation
of
the
company.
and
they
sold
out
our
share
and
they
sold
all
the
assets
to
themselves
and
they're
giving
us
what
they
want
to
give
us.
we
think
we're
entitled
to
get
what
they
were
really
worth.
now,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fairness
of
the
plan
whatsoever.
that
plan
never
existed
if
we're
going
to
follow
the
mandate
of
the
congress.
thank
you.
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
mr.
chief
justice
and
your
honors,
the
fairness
as
a
matter
of
a
fair
ratio
of
exchange
in
the
merger
is
not
here.
what
we
seek
is
the
value
of
what
we
gave
up.
we
charge
unfairness
in
the
sense
that
the
respondents
were
unjustly
enriched
not
that
the
ratio
exchange
was
unfair.
it
is
not
mr.
shure
who
wrote
the
act
and
said
that
the
trial
section
shall
be
deemed
as
void,
congress
said
that.
we
are
taking
the
posture
the
congress
places
and
in
says
“the
wrong
doer
shall
not
profit”.
now,
mr.
john
b.
dawson
who's
the
outstanding
authority
of
harvard,
and
the
subject
of
unjust
enrichment
wrote
as
leading
text
on
that
in
1951
and
any
resort
to
that
shows
that
remedies
at
law
that
the
general
attempted
remedy
--
remedy
as
an
equity
tracing
of
assets,
equitable
liens
and
so
on
are
all
different
forms
and
this
is
what
people
who
understand
the
law
of
restitution
are
talking
about
when
they
say
that
you
shall
view
a
transaction
under
the
securities
act
as
void.
it
means
that
you
get
that
not
with
all
the
consequences
of
the
merger
attached
to
it
but
with
the
situation
as
it
existed
before
that.
we
are
contempt
to
let
the
government's
brief
speak
for
itself
as
to
what
they're
referring
is
relevant
to
the
--
to
causation.
the
court
asked
--
mr.
justice
harlan
mr.
jenner
as
to
what
the
differences
were.
there's
a
very
substantial
difference,
they
don't
agree
at
all.
the
government
says
that
the
judgment
should
stand
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
that
we
have
proved
everything
necessary
to
establish
a
cause
of
action
and
that
certain
consequences
flow
from
this.
they
do
say
as
we
agree
that
fairness
of
the
ratio
of
exchange
--
and
i'm
talking
about
the
commission
may
be
relevant
to
one
measure
of
monetary
recovery.
but
the
fairness
that
the
exchange
ratio
is
not
the
only
measure
of
damages
and
the
fairness
of
the
ratio
is
not
relevant
to
unjust
enrichment
causes
of
action
which
is
the
basis
of
the
remedies
under
the
34
act.
borak
points
that
out.
this
commission
said
but
where
ends
here
misleading
aspect
of
situation
--
solicitation
did
not
relate
to
the
terms
of
merger.
the
mislead
stockholders
should
be
entitled
a
monetary
or
other
relief
only
if
the
merger
resulted
in
a
reduction
to
them
of
earnings
or
earnings
potential.
now
what
does
that
mean?
that
means
that
if
we
were
entitled
to
get
2.5
shares
of
preferred
stock
under
the
merger
and
we
only
received
1
8/10,
then
we
ought
to
get
it
or
get
that
in
dollars.
we
are
the
plaintiffs.
we
are
the
ones
who
have
been
injured.
we
brought
the
suit
whose
here
and
we
are
asking
that
all
these
people
who
were
short
changed
on
the
merger
in
anyway
you
look
at
that
proxy
statement,
it
is
inescapable.
what
did
they
do
here?
they
took
$23.00
a
share
of
the
book
value
off
the
bars
and
they
gave
--
we
ended
up
with
$64.00
or
$65.00
a
share,
$64.86
and
the
shareholders
at
mergenthaler
end
up
with
$107.00
a
share
of
book
value.
they
just
handed
it
over
to
the
other
people.
and
we
are
told
here
that
we
just
have
no
remedy
here
if
the
ratio
of
exchange.
we
would
get
into
a
war
here
of
experts.
and
that's
what
the
small
shareholder
is
not
able
to
do.
we
can't
match
the
great
corporation
with
all
of
its
assets
in
that
kind
of
a
war.
congress
envisioned
this
sort
of
thing
and
gave
us
a
short,
quick
remedy
of
restitution
and
said
we
can
have
any
avenue
relief
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
the
only
byway
of
emphasis
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned,
i
believe
that
at
page
18
of
their
brief,
they
did
not
explain
what
they
meant
by
earnings
potential
--
laws
of
earnings
or
earnings
potential.
obviously
looking
at
the
government's
brief
and
looking
at
their
other
writings
that
is
inescapable
if
this
is
unjust
enrichment
we're
talking
about,
then
we
can
get
at
that
unjust
enrichment
at
any
way
that
the
facts
can
be
reached.
and
we
say
that
there
is
no
room
for
any
further
hearing
on
cause
of
relation
hold
that
there
is
this
room
for
remedy.
they
can
--
if
somebody
wants
to
have
a
trial
on
the
question
of
fairness
of
what
we
received,
this
is
an
entirely
different
situation
from
proving
the
fairness.
and
the
government
says
to
us
“you're
not
entitled
at
getting
damages
if
you
didn't
lose
anything.”
but
what
have
the
court
of
appeals
said?
the
court
of
appeals
said
“if
you
don't
get
divestiture
because
it
was
a
fair
plan,
then
you
don't
get
anything,”
except
of
course
as
they
gave
us
a
bill
for
$9000.00
of
cost
for
losing
the
appeal.
they
reversed
and
assessed
the
cost
against
us
when
we
vindicated
the
law
and
we
won
on
the
issue
of
materiality
and
the
fact
of
violation
but
they
say
we
lose
the
case
and
we
get
absolutely
nothing
by
restitution
or
any
other
way.
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
envision
this.
it's
either
restitution
or
it's
either
divestiture
unscrambling
of
merger.
and
if
you
read
their
opinion,
the
language
is
very
clear.
they
give
this
as
a
rationale.
not
every
merger
should
be
set
aside
because
of
a
nondisclosure.
and
as
far
as
i
am
not
going
to
rebut
to
what
mr.
jenner
said
about
whether
there
was
fraud
charge
or
not,
that
matter
is
not
before
this
court
and
we
didn't
do
it
in
our
briefs.
i
don't
think
we
should
spend
our
time
on
it
now.
the
respondents
will
get
a
full
trial
of
the
question
of
what
the
damages
should
be.
we
don't
want
this
court
to
foreclose
us
from
using
any
of
the
means
of
securing
restitution
that
borak
says
that
it
should
be
followed.
and
borak
relied
on
decker
versus
independent
shares
which
also
talked
of
restitution.
and
borak
talked
of
the
section
33
act
which
gives
a
restitutionary
remedy.
now
this
is
what
we're
talking
about
that
the
wrong
doer
gets
no
benefit
whatsoever
out
of
his
wrong
doing.
but
when
i
say
that,
i
don't
mean
you
tear
the
thing
asunder,
i'm
not
interested
in
tearing
apart
corporate
structures,
i
cite
that
as
one
of
the
things
we
ask
for.
you
go
down
the
languages
and
state
your
prayers
in
a
complaint,
you
ask
for
all
the
different
things.
every
lawyer
does
this
in
drafting
a
complaint.
but
as
per
accounting,
ask
for
damages,
we
are
not
trying
to
be
unreasonable.
we
feel
we've
been
very
badly
dealt
with
in
this
on
the
basis
of
the
--
what
we
are
going
to
get
under
the
merger
because
it
is
--
it
was
so
far
below
book
value
and
they
gave
our
book
value
the
other
side.
we
didn't
get
a
fair
market
value
exchange
because
if
we
took
the
preferred
and
convert
in
the
common,
we'd
immediately
suffer
a
loss
of
$6.00
to
$9.00
on
the
basis
of
market
values.
if
you
don't
take
book
and
you
don't
take
market,
what
do
you
take?
you
take
what
your
own
directors
who
are
the
deputies
of
your
adversary
in
the
merger
want
to
give
you.
and
that
--
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
arnold
i.
shure
i
want
to
thank
you
very
much
for
your
--
