mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i
unfortunately
caught
a
cold
yesterday
and
i
think
it
has
affected
my
hearing
a
little
bit
but
not
otherwise.
if
your
honors
please,
it
may
be
unusual
and
perhaps
it's
unusual
that
securities
and
exchange
commission
case
be
as
living
as
a
case
as
this
one
involving
uses
of
summary
judgment
procedures
so
that
the
respondent
in
this
case
has
never
had
a
trial.
the
limitation
of
various
issues
arguments
now
in
this
court
that
under
a
splendid
benefit
of
statute
as
this
one
is
that
what
the
congress
intended
and
what
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
intended
at
adopting
a
rule
under
section
14
(a)
was
to
cut
off
--
to
cut
off
a
consideration
of
any
court
including
this
one
at
some
early
stage
of
the
game
if
there
is
say
let
us
say
a
technical
any
kind
of
alleged
violation
of
the
rule
which
i'm
about
to
read
to
your
honors
that
at
that
moment
further
judicial
inquiry
seizes.
and
as
mr.
shure
has
argue
to
your
honors,
there
comes
a
situation
in
which
that
trial
court
must
then
say
to
itself
as
of
the
time
of
the
consummation
of
this
merger
that
have
molded
to
a
purchase
by
the
surviving
company
of
the
company
merged
into
that
surviving
company
and
so
you
must
judge
its
value
on
pure
asset
value
as
a
way
of
a
liquidation.
fairness
is
immaterial.
did
congress
intend
by
the
adoption
of
this
benefition
statute
and
the
sec
adopting
the
rule
under
it
that
fairness
should
be
excluded.
now,
may
i
turn
to
borak
mr.
justice
white
has
imparted
mr.
shure
on
that
subject
matter.
on
this
issue,
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
chief
justice
and
gentlemen,
what
this
court
said,
first,
that
case
as
your
honors
will
clearly
recall
of
course
was
a
holding
that
section
14
(a)
created
a
federal
right.
it
did
not
have
the
mercy
of
the
ship.
it
did
not
have
to
sue
under
a
common
law
or
fraud.
you
had
a
federal
cause
of
action.
and
when
there
was
oppressing
in
recourse
to
that
case
as
to
the
consequences
of
a
violation,
great,
small
and
deferred
or
horrendous
as
the
case
might
be,
what
was
the
consequence?
mr.
justice
clark
before
the
court
said,
“the
causal
relationship--”
and
i'm
quoting
from
that
case,
“the
causal
relationship
for
the
proxy
material
and
the
merger
are
questions
of
fact
to
be
resolved
at
the
trial
not
here.”
now,
may
i
respectfully
suggest
that
to
me
means
that
if
a
violation
is
determined
upon
by
the
trial
court
after
considering
all
the
circumstances,
then
the
court
goes
on
to
determine
what
the
consequences
are
cause
of
relationships
have
resulted
and
that
one
of
those
factors
as
far
as
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
says
in
this
amicus
curiae
brief
submitted
to
your
honors.
now,
what
is
the
statute
or
rule
as
presented
here?
it
is
simply
this,
no
solicitation
subject
to
this
regulation
shall
be
made
by
means
of
any
proxy
statement,
form
of
proxy,
notice
of
meeting
or
other
communication
written
or
oral
containing
any
statement
which
at
that
time
and
in
the
light
of
the
circumstances
under
which
it
is
made.
may
i
repeat
that
if
your
honors
please,
at
that
time
and
in
the
light
of
the
circumstances
under
which
it
is
made
is
false
or
misleading
with
respect
to
any
material
of
fact
or
which
shall
omit
the
state
any
material
fact
necessary
in
order
to
make
the
statements
they're
in
not
faults
or
misleading.
now,
what
happened
in
this
particular
case?
a
proxy
statement
of
108
pages
set
forth
in
volume
1
of
the
transcript
annex
of
this
case
was
sent
to
the
shareholder
three
weeks
before
a
proposed
merger
meeting
of
the
shareholders,
received
by
mr.
shure's
clients.
and
here
they
turned
--
one
client
turned
over
the
proxy
statement
to
him,
the
other
client
i
know
was
that
mr.
mill's
assessment
to
mr.
norman
nasher
of
the
chicago
bar,
most
distinguished
lawyers.
they
expressed
their
views
that
is,
the
clients
that
they
understood
the
proxy
statement,
they
were
opposed
to
the
merger
and
they
voted
against
the
merger.
and
they
appear
here
as
plaintiffs
who
have
voted
against
the
merger.
on
behalf
of
all
shareholders
including
those
who
voted
for
it,
over
5000
who
voted
for
it
seeking
to
set
this
aside.
now,
i
can
never
been
quite
able
to
comprehend
mr.
shure's
argument
either
at
the
trial
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
this
court
as
to
what
he
means
by
restitution.
may
i
suggest
your
honors
that
although
i
can
resort
to
mr.
shure's
brief
in
which
he
says
as
follows
as
to
what
consequence
he
wants
to
flow
from
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
this
case
if
your
honors
please
was
a
misemphasis.
not
a
horrendous
omission,
a
misemphasis
with
respect
to
the
relationship
of
directors
in
the
several
corporations.
mr.
shure
says
at
page
69
of
his
brief
so
i
don't
misinterpret
it
this
is
what
he
says,
“here,
the
petitioners
have
repudiated
the
merger
asking
for
“appropriate
orders
setting
it
aside”
and
for
an
order
directing
respondents
to
accounts
of
the
corporation
for
the
damages
sustained
by
reason
of
the
invalid
transfer
of
corporate
essence.
they
do
not
ask
to
enforce
the
merger
agreement
but
to
be
put
in
the
position
they
would've
occupied
if
no
unlawful
merger
had
been
affected.
the
right
to
that
relief
undistracted
by
any
inquiry
into
fairness.”
this
court
is
not
to
go
under
the
fairness
and
no
one
is
to
go
in
the
question
of
fairness.
is
court
necessary
to
make
effective
the
congressional
purpose?
now,
what
is
this
perspective?
what
is
in
the
time
and
in
the
light
of
the
circumstances
under
which
these
supposed
omissions
or
misemphasis
in
this
proxy
statement
occur?
in
dollar
terms
if
your
honors
please,
the
minority
of
shareholders
here
have
benefited
enormously.
now,
if
they
have
not
benefited,
i'm
sure
that
mr.
shure
would
be
here
urging
that
upon
the
court.
but
they
have
benefited
enormously.
on
the
day
of
merger,
the
electric
auto-lite
shares
were
selling
at
$59.00.
the
shares
of
the
surviving
corporation
as
of
yesterday's
market
on
the
conversion
of
substance,
all
of
these
shares
have
been
converted,
very,
very
few
i
think
in
less
than
500
shares
not
converted
with
$127.00
a
share
and
at
one
time
were
up
as
high
as
$200.00
a
share.
so
in
separate
terms,
this
is
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
1.88
of
the
shares
of
the
surviving
of
the
surviving
corporation
for
each
share
of
electro
auto-lite.
and
then
there
was
in
the
meantime
if
your
honors
please
is
that
introversion,
there
was
a
stock
split
two
for
one
and
then
there
was
a
percentage
given
out.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
as
i
guess
with
today's
market,
$2.00.
secondly,
now
although
petitioners'
lose
claims
on
the
contrary
on
their
brief,
the
fact
is
there's
absolutely
if
your
honors
please
no
question
or
fraud
in
this
case.
no
question
or
fraud
in
this
case
at
all
and
no
intentional
wrong
doing.
there
isn't
a
word
in
the
briefs
of
the
petitioners
here
and
there
isn't
a
word
in
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
amicus
curiae
our
brief
to
your
honors
suggest
any
intents
on
wrong
doing
whatsoever
in
this
case.
we're
not
evil
doers.
a
technicality
is
being
urged
upon
the
court.
here
is
a
living
case
in
which
the
petitioner
is
asking
the
court
having
found
a
misemphasis
in
a
proxy
statement,
you
must
not
close
your
eyes
to
the
statute
and
the
effect
of
this
action.
now,
are
there
any
common
sense
view
of
this
case,
any
common
sense
view?
this
alleged
deficiency
that
is
our
failure
to
emphasize
as
strongly
as
mr.
shure's
client
thought
should
be
emphasized
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
pendum
by
mr.
justice
carol
felt
should've
been
emphasized
a
little
bit
more
that
is
that
directors
of
electro
auto-lite
were
nominated
by
mergenthaler,
that
directors
of
mergenthaler
were
nominated
by
american
manufacturing
should've
been
brought
out
more
firmly
to
show
an
alleged
conflict.
but,
if
your
honors
please
in
the
very
proxy
statement
itself
five
lines
if
i
may
seek
your
honors
permission
in
five
lines
in
the
proxy
statement
itself
page
30
of
the
first
volume
of
the
abstract,
“mergenthaler
which
owns
approximately
54%
of
the
outstanding
shares
of
electric
auto-lite
intends
to
vote
in
a
favor
of
approval
of
the
agreement
of
merger.”
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
would
you
forgive
your
honor
and
repeat
that?
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
we
think
it's
a
question
of
fact
and
we
believe
because
the
trial
court
followed
so
called
summary
judgment
procedure
that
we
have
never
received
a
full
trial
on
the
issue
or
whether
this
difference
and
emphasis
was
in
fact
a
material
omission.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no,
we
didn't
cross
petition
if
your
honor
please
and
we
do
think
it's
here.
your
honors
granted
cert.
your
honors
did
not
limit
the
grant
of
cert
and
in
our
opinion
that
in
(voice
overlap)
--
excuse
me
your
honor?
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
well
yes
they
are
and
they
certainly
should
be.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
think
not
if
your
honor
pleases.
it
is
my
position
that
the
issue
of
materiality
is
in
as
carefully
bound
into
the
question
of
causation
of
fairness
and
the
fact
of
this
on
the
shareholders.
but,
i
must
say
to
all
your
honors
in
great
sincerity
and
candid
that
my
clients
can
live
and
live
well
with
the
opinion
on
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit
because
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit
remanded
this
case
to
the
trial
court
to
afford
us
a
trial
on
the
issue
of
whether
it's
stated
in
14
(a)
sub
9
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
they
rule
that
at
the
time
and
on
the
light
of
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
made,
the
statement
violated
the
rule
to
have
a
consequential
effect
upon
as
this
court
said
should
be
determined
in
borak
upon
this
merger
rather
than
as
mr.
shure
suggest
yet
the
entry
quickly
of
an
order.
on
summary
judgment
or
otherwise
which
says
there's
a
technical
violation
of
this
rule
and
then
you
don't
have
to
go
into
fairness.
fairness
is
immaterial.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
the
government's
position
as
i
understand
its
position
have
very
well
stated
in
its
brief.
i
may
stand
and
i
wish
to
compliment
the
sec
council
and
the
solicitor
general
griswold
in
a
well
written
brief.
the
government
is
concerned
as
i
view
their
brief
about
what
is
called
corporate
suffrage.
since
they
have
a
rule
that
certain
materials
--
matters
shall
be
reported
in
a
proxy
statement
that
there
should
be
encouragement
of
minority
show
as
in
others
to
make
compliant
promptly
in
the
event
that
they
see
oversights
or
other
violations
of
14
(a)
(9).
and
in
order
to
encourage
that,
there
should
at
the
outset
as
quickly
as
possible
be
a
--
some
kind
of
a
technical
finding
of
liability.
now,
the
liability
that
which
the
government
speaks
is
not
a
consequential
liability
but
one
that
will
afford
enough
anchor
may
i
put
it
that
way,
enough
anchor
to
allow
suit
expense
and
the
attorney's
fees
to
the
minority
shareholders
that
make
their
complaint.
the
government
says
that
fairness
is
a
factor,
disagrees
with
mr.
shure
on
that.
the
government
says,
sec
says
this
is
not
void.
that
is
a
--
the
fact
that
a
crisis
statement
doesn't
happen
to
fit
in
all
the
decree
with
14
(a)
(9).
it
doesn't
make
the
transaction
void.
it
doesn't
make
those
votes
void.
they're
voided
perhaps
in
the
light
of
all
the
circumstances
and
after
a
full
trial
of
the
case.
but
they're
not
void.
mr.
shure's
your
honors
will
recall
from
the
record
prosecuted
a
cross
appeal
from
the
district
court's
opinion
and
which
the
district
court
had
struck
out
of
his
judgment
a
finding
that
this
merger
was
void.
he
--
mr.
shure
had
not
argued
very
vigorously
in
this
reply
brief
but
he
did
argue
in
his
opening
brief
and
is
petitioned
for
certain
in
this
case
that
it
was
all
void.
now,
whether
this
court
having
before
it
now
in
the
position
of
the
sec,
mr.
justice
harlan,
to
create
a
federal
law
of
corporations
in
which
the
court
withhold
that
14
(a)
and
the
rule
under
in
(14)
(a)
(9)
does
give
a
district
court
jurisdiction
to
allow
attorneys
fees
and
suit
expense
even
though
the
traditional
duration
of
a
fund
or
other
benefit
is
not
obtained
but
only
that
there
has
been
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
some
deviation
from
(14)
(a)
(9)
and
the
proxy
material
should
be
restated
and
their
should
be
a
re-solicitation.
in
order
to
encourage
that
says
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
fees
and
expenses
should
be
allowed.
may
i
suggest
too
your
honors
in
that
connection
that
as
i
have
trouble
going
through
that
theory,
i
likened
it
to
this
as
a
possibility.
in
your
experience
and
of
course
all
litigators,
are
will
and
trust
construction
cases
in
which
the
testator
drafts
his
will
or
trusts
as
preferred
and
there's
an
ambiguity
and
it
has
cause,
there
was
lawyers
cause.
then
the
expense
of
resolving
that
ambiguity
is
assessed
against
the
estate
and
perhaps
that
maybe
inevitable,
whereby
the
securities
and
exchange
commission's
suggestions
to
this
court
may
possibly
be
accommodated.
now,
it
seems
inconceivable
though
to
us,
of
course
i'm
an
advocate
that
it
seems
inconceivable
to
me
because
i'm
advocating
for
a
client.
but
try
to
be
as
candid
as
i
possibly
can,
i
can't
conceive
of
a
situation
in
which
fairness,
the
--
it's
not
a
--
i
want
to
say
it
was
a
defense.
it's
a
factor
to
take
into
consideration
in
the
element
resolution
of
the
whole
case.
as
we
complain
in
our
brief,
we
tried
--
we
tried
--
we
tried
before
his
honor
judge
parsons
in
the
district
court
to
have
this
case
set
for
trial
on
all
three
counts
not
on
these
motions
for
limited
findings
on
summary
judgment
and
then
a
reference
to
the
whole
case
to
a
master
with
no
limitations
to
the
master,
no
guidelines
to
the
master
and
what
he
was
going
to
decide
on
the
causation
and
result.
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
holds
--
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
reference
to
a
master
here
had
to
follow
with
the
ordered.
but
not
only
because
of
the
summary
judgment
order
but
also
because
there
were
no
guidelines
in
referring
this
case
to
a
master
to
tell
the
judge
--
the
court
what
the
relief
was
going
to
be.
when
i
may
by
opening
to
say
that
this
was
a
live
case
pertaining
to
this
court,
many
problems
i
had
in
mind,
the
procedures
were
followed
here.
we've
never
had
a
trial.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
we
did
if
your
honor
pleases
and
we
made
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no.
that
isn't
our
position.
i
don't
want
to
be
fictitious
if
your
honor
pleases.
it
wasn't
wrong
because
it
was
a
summary
judgment.
it
was
wrong
because
questions
of
fact
were
presented
that
could
not
be
resolved
by
summary
judgment
but
which
were
in
fact
resolved
by
summary
judgment
that
there
were
considerations
and
factors
to
be
taken
into
consideration
by
the
court
which
he
did
not
take
any
consideration.
one
factor
being
if
your
honor
pleases
is
the
question
of
fairness
of
mr.
shure's
of
how
you're
going
to
determine
what's
in
the
mind
of
a
shareholder
who
voted
for
this
merger.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
certainly
do
if
your
honor
pleases.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i'm
not--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes.
and
that's
did
not
petition
this
court
for
cross
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
we're
attempting
to
sustain
the
court
of
appeals
in
so
far
as
the
court
of
appeals
granted
summary
judgment
that
we
should
earn
title
to
a
trial
on
all
the
issues
in
the
case.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
may
i
try
to
put
it
this
way
if
your
honor
pleases.
you're
very
precise
and
i
would
--
i'd
like
and
if
i
can
answer
it
precisely.
it
is
our
position
that
causation,
effect
and
materiality
are
one
ball
of
wax
that
you
really
can't
separate
them.
and
when
the
court
separates
them
as
was
done
here
by
way
of
--
particularly
when
a
resort
is
lying
to
summary
judgment
and
you
held
these
major
considerations
had
bear
on
materiality
excise
and
under
consideration
by
the
judge
on
the
issue
of
so
called
materiality,
you
get
the
case
all
segmented.
and
a
badge,
a
scarlet
letter
is
placed
on
the
bag--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
only
to
the
extent
that
the
nature
of
that
which
was
not
included
in
the
proxy
statement
or
the
mis-emphasis
in
the
proxy
statement
has
a
bearing
on
causation.
i
hope
i
don't
sound
as
though
i'm
double
talking.
it's
a
factor
in
this
whole
ball
of
wax
if
it
be
considered
when
it
makes
--
the
court
makes
a
settlement
judgment
should
you
unscramble
or
as
mr.
shure
where
he
would
like
to
have
this
court
hold
this
is
a
violation
of
section
14
(a)
and
therefore,
this
proxies
don't
mean
anything,
there
has
to
be
what
he
call
as
restitution
that
is
a
determination
that
you
take
this
company
not
as
a
viable
company
earning
money
or
trying
to
earn
money
but
as
a
sack
of
assets.
and
you
determine
--
we're
now
applying
that
formula.
as
of
that
day,
this
--
if
it
happened
in
liquidation
and
distribution
as
of
that
day,
this
once
would've
fall
money
wise.
and
you
don't
pay
any
tax.
and
what
did
happen
in
the
meantime
even
though
it's
here
because
of
the
soundness
of
the
plan
of
merger
and
placing
these
two
companies
together
that
this
share
of
this
day
worth
twice
as
much
as
what
they
were
when
the
shareholders
overwhelmingly
94%
voted
in
favor
of
this
merger.
mr.
shure
wants
to
cut
things
off
especially
he
wants
to
cut
off
fairness.
all
we've
been
seeking
to
do
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
gave
us.
we
did
not
point
the
way
we
wanted
it
but
we
can
live
with
it
at
trial
on
all
of
these
issues
not
so
what
we're
seeking.
and
we
thank
the
court
of
appeals
gave
it
to
us
and
we
think
mr.
shure
is
seeking
to
urge
this
court
to
diagnose.
do
any
of
your
honors
have
any
further
questions?
thank
you.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i
unfortunately
caught
a
cold
yesterday
and
i
think
it
has
affected
my
hearing
a
little
bit
but
not
otherwise.
if
your
honors
please,
it
may
be
unusual
and
perhaps
it's
unusual
that
securities
and
exchange
commission
case
be
as
living
as
a
case
as
this
one
involving
uses
of
summary
judgment
procedures
so
that
the
respondent
in
this
case
has
never
had
a
trial.
the
limitation
of
various
issues
arguments
now
in
this
court
that
under
a
splendid
benefit
of
statute
as
this
one
is
that
what
the
congress
intended
and
what
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
intended
at
adopting
a
rule
under
section
14
(a)
was
to
cut
off
--
to
cut
off
a
consideration
of
any
court
including
this
one
at
some
early
stage
of
the
game
if
there
is
say
let
us
say
a
technical
any
kind
of
alleged
violation
of
the
rule
which
i'm
about
to
read
to
your
honors
that
at
that
moment
further
judicial
inquiry
seizes.
and
as
mr.
shure
has
argue
to
your
honors,
there
comes
a
situation
in
which
that
trial
court
must
then
say
to
itself
as
of
the
time
of
the
consummation
of
this
merger
that
have
molded
to
a
purchase
by
the
surviving
company
of
the
company
merged
into
that
surviving
company
and
so
you
must
judge
its
value
on
pure
asset
value
as
a
way
of
a
liquidation.
fairness
is
immaterial.
did
congress
intend
by
the
adoption
of
this
benefition
statute
and
the
sec
adopting
the
rule
under
it
that
fairness
should
be
excluded.
now,
may
i
turn
to
borak
mr.
justice
white
has
imparted
mr.
shure
on
that
subject
matter.
on
this
issue,
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
chief
justice
and
gentlemen,
what
this
court
said,
first,
that
case
as
your
honors
will
clearly
recall
of
course
was
a
holding
that
section
14
(a)
created
a
federal
right.
it
did
not
have
the
mercy
of
the
ship.
it
did
not
have
to
sue
under
a
common
law
or
fraud.
you
had
a
federal
cause
of
action.
and
when
there
was
oppressing
in
recourse
to
that
case
as
to
the
consequences
of
a
violation,
great,
small
and
deferred
or
horrendous
as
the
case
might
be,
what
was
the
consequence?
mr.
justice
clark
before
the
court
said,
“the
causal
relationship--”
and
i'm
quoting
from
that
case,
“the
causal
relationship
for
the
proxy
material
and
the
merger
are
questions
of
fact
to
be
resolved
at
the
trial
not
here.”
now,
may
i
respectfully
suggest
that
to
me
means
that
if
a
violation
is
determined
upon
by
the
trial
court
after
considering
all
the
circumstances,
then
the
court
goes
on
to
determine
what
the
consequences
are
cause
of
relationships
have
resulted
and
that
one
of
those
factors
as
far
as
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
says
in
this
amicus
curiae
brief
submitted
to
your
honors.
now,
what
is
the
statute
or
rule
as
presented
here?
it
is
simply
this,
no
solicitation
subject
to
this
regulation
shall
be
made
by
means
of
any
proxy
statement,
form
of
proxy,
notice
of
meeting
or
other
communication
written
or
oral
containing
any
statement
which
at
that
time
and
in
the
light
of
the
circumstances
under
which
it
is
made.
may
i
repeat
that
if
your
honors
please,
at
that
time
and
in
the
light
of
the
circumstances
under
which
it
is
made
is
false
or
misleading
with
respect
to
any
material
of
fact
or
which
shall
omit
the
state
any
material
fact
necessary
in
order
to
make
the
statements
they're
in
not
faults
or
misleading.
now,
what
happened
in
this
particular
case?
a
proxy
statement
of
108
pages
set
forth
in
volume
1
of
the
transcript
annex
of
this
case
was
sent
to
the
shareholder
three
weeks
before
a
proposed
merger
meeting
of
the
shareholders,
received
by
mr.
shure's
clients.
and
here
they
turned
--
one
client
turned
over
the
proxy
statement
to
him,
the
other
client
i
know
was
that
mr.
mill's
assessment
to
mr.
norman
nasher
of
the
chicago
bar,
most
distinguished
lawyers.
they
expressed
their
views
that
is,
the
clients
that
they
understood
the
proxy
statement,
they
were
opposed
to
the
merger
and
they
voted
against
the
merger.
and
they
appear
here
as
plaintiffs
who
have
voted
against
the
merger.
on
behalf
of
all
shareholders
including
those
who
voted
for
it,
over
5000
who
voted
for
it
seeking
to
set
this
aside.
now,
i
can
never
been
quite
able
to
comprehend
mr.
shure's
argument
either
at
the
trial
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
this
court
as
to
what
he
means
by
restitution.
may
i
suggest
your
honors
that
although
i
can
resort
to
mr.
shure's
brief
in
which
he
says
as
follows
as
to
what
consequence
he
wants
to
flow
from
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
this
case
if
your
honors
please
was
a
misemphasis.
not
a
horrendous
omission,
a
misemphasis
with
respect
to
the
relationship
of
directors
in
the
several
corporations.
mr.
shure
says
at
page
69
of
his
brief
so
i
don't
misinterpret
it
this
is
what
he
says,
“here,
the
petitioners
have
repudiated
the
merger
asking
for
“appropriate
orders
setting
it
aside”
and
for
an
order
directing
respondents
to
accounts
of
the
corporation
for
the
damages
sustained
by
reason
of
the
invalid
transfer
of
corporate
essence.
they
do
not
ask
to
enforce
the
merger
agreement
but
to
be
put
in
the
position
they
would've
occupied
if
no
unlawful
merger
had
been
affected.
the
right
to
that
relief
undistracted
by
any
inquiry
into
fairness.”
this
court
is
not
to
go
under
the
fairness
and
no
one
is
to
go
in
the
question
of
fairness.
is
court
necessary
to
make
effective
the
congressional
purpose?
now,
what
is
this
perspective?
what
is
in
the
time
and
in
the
light
of
the
circumstances
under
which
these
supposed
omissions
or
misemphasis
in
this
proxy
statement
occur?
in
dollar
terms
if
your
honors
please,
the
minority
of
shareholders
here
have
benefited
enormously.
now,
if
they
have
not
benefited,
i'm
sure
that
mr.
shure
would
be
here
urging
that
upon
the
court.
but
they
have
benefited
enormously.
on
the
day
of
merger,
the
electric
auto-lite
shares
were
selling
at
$59.00.
the
shares
of
the
surviving
corporation
as
of
yesterday's
market
on
the
conversion
of
substance,
all
of
these
shares
have
been
converted,
very,
very
few
i
think
in
less
than
500
shares
not
converted
with
$127.00
a
share
and
at
one
time
were
up
as
high
as
$200.00
a
share.
so
in
separate
terms,
this
is
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
1.88
of
the
shares
of
the
surviving
of
the
surviving
corporation
for
each
share
of
electro
auto-lite.
and
then
there
was
in
the
meantime
if
your
honors
please
is
that
introversion,
there
was
a
stock
split
two
for
one
and
then
there
was
a
percentage
given
out.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
as
i
guess
with
today's
market,
$2.00.
secondly,
now
although
petitioners'
lose
claims
on
the
contrary
on
their
brief,
the
fact
is
there's
absolutely
if
your
honors
please
no
question
or
fraud
in
this
case.
no
question
or
fraud
in
this
case
at
all
and
no
intentional
wrong
doing.
there
isn't
a
word
in
the
briefs
of
the
petitioners
here
and
there
isn't
a
word
in
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
amicus
curiae
our
brief
to
your
honors
suggest
any
intents
on
wrong
doing
whatsoever
in
this
case.
we're
not
evil
doers.
a
technicality
is
being
urged
upon
the
court.
here
is
a
living
case
in
which
the
petitioner
is
asking
the
court
having
found
a
misemphasis
in
a
proxy
statement,
you
must
not
close
your
eyes
to
the
statute
and
the
effect
of
this
action.
now,
are
there
any
common
sense
view
of
this
case,
any
common
sense
view?
this
alleged
deficiency
that
is
our
failure
to
emphasize
as
strongly
as
mr.
shure's
client
thought
should
be
emphasized
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
pendum
by
mr.
justice
carol
felt
should've
been
emphasized
a
little
bit
more
that
is
that
directors
of
electro
auto-lite
were
nominated
by
mergenthaler,
that
directors
of
mergenthaler
were
nominated
by
american
manufacturing
should've
been
brought
out
more
firmly
to
show
an
alleged
conflict.
but,
if
your
honors
please
in
the
very
proxy
statement
itself
five
lines
if
i
may
seek
your
honors
permission
in
five
lines
in
the
proxy
statement
itself
page
30
of
the
first
volume
of
the
abstract,
“mergenthaler
which
owns
approximately
54%
of
the
outstanding
shares
of
electric
auto-lite
intends
to
vote
in
a
favor
of
approval
of
the
agreement
of
merger.”
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
would
you
forgive
your
honor
and
repeat
that?
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
we
think
it's
a
question
of
fact
and
we
believe
because
the
trial
court
followed
so
called
summary
judgment
procedure
that
we
have
never
received
a
full
trial
on
the
issue
or
whether
this
difference
and
emphasis
was
in
fact
a
material
omission.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no,
we
didn't
cross
petition
if
your
honor
please
and
we
do
think
it's
here.
your
honors
granted
cert.
your
honors
did
not
limit
the
grant
of
cert
and
in
our
opinion
that
in
(voice
overlap)
--
excuse
me
your
honor?
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
well
yes
they
are
and
they
certainly
should
be.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
think
not
if
your
honor
pleases.
it
is
my
position
that
the
issue
of
materiality
is
in
as
carefully
bound
into
the
question
of
causation
of
fairness
and
the
fact
of
this
on
the
shareholders.
but,
i
must
say
to
all
your
honors
in
great
sincerity
and
candid
that
my
clients
can
live
and
live
well
with
the
opinion
on
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit
because
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit
remanded
this
case
to
the
trial
court
to
afford
us
a
trial
on
the
issue
of
whether
it's
stated
in
14
(a)
sub
9
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
they
rule
that
at
the
time
and
on
the
light
of
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
made,
the
statement
violated
the
rule
to
have
a
consequential
effect
upon
as
this
court
said
should
be
determined
in
borak
upon
this
merger
rather
than
as
mr.
shure
suggest
yet
the
entry
quickly
of
an
order.
on
summary
judgment
or
otherwise
which
says
there's
a
technical
violation
of
this
rule
and
then
you
don't
have
to
go
into
fairness.
fairness
is
immaterial.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
the
government's
position
as
i
understand
its
position
have
very
well
stated
in
its
brief.
i
may
stand
and
i
wish
to
compliment
the
sec
council
and
the
solicitor
general
griswold
in
a
well
written
brief.
the
government
is
concerned
as
i
view
their
brief
about
what
is
called
corporate
suffrage.
since
they
have
a
rule
that
certain
materials
--
matters
shall
be
reported
in
a
proxy
statement
that
there
should
be
encouragement
of
minority
show
as
in
others
to
make
compliant
promptly
in
the
event
that
they
see
oversights
or
other
violations
of
14
(a)
(9).
and
in
order
to
encourage
that,
there
should
at
the
outset
as
quickly
as
possible
be
a
--
some
kind
of
a
technical
finding
of
liability.
now,
the
liability
that
which
the
government
speaks
is
not
a
consequential
liability
but
one
that
will
afford
enough
anchor
may
i
put
it
that
way,
enough
anchor
to
allow
suit
expense
and
the
attorney's
fees
to
the
minority
shareholders
that
make
their
complaint.
the
government
says
that
fairness
is
a
factor,
disagrees
with
mr.
shure
on
that.
the
government
says,
sec
says
this
is
not
void.
that
is
a
--
the
fact
that
a
crisis
statement
doesn't
happen
to
fit
in
all
the
decree
with
14
(a)
(9).
it
doesn't
make
the
transaction
void.
it
doesn't
make
those
votes
void.
they're
voided
perhaps
in
the
light
of
all
the
circumstances
and
after
a
full
trial
of
the
case.
but
they're
not
void.
mr.
shure's
your
honors
will
recall
from
the
record
prosecuted
a
cross
appeal
from
the
district
court's
opinion
and
which
the
district
court
had
struck
out
of
his
judgment
a
finding
that
this
merger
was
void.
he
--
mr.
shure
had
not
argued
very
vigorously
in
this
reply
brief
but
he
did
argue
in
his
opening
brief
and
is
petitioned
for
certain
in
this
case
that
it
was
all
void.
now,
whether
this
court
having
before
it
now
in
the
position
of
the
sec,
mr.
justice
harlan,
to
create
a
federal
law
of
corporations
in
which
the
court
withhold
that
14
(a)
and
the
rule
under
in
(14)
(a)
(9)
does
give
a
district
court
jurisdiction
to
allow
attorneys
fees
and
suit
expense
even
though
the
traditional
duration
of
a
fund
or
other
benefit
is
not
obtained
but
only
that
there
has
been
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
some
deviation
from
(14)
(a)
(9)
and
the
proxy
material
should
be
restated
and
their
should
be
a
re-solicitation.
in
order
to
encourage
that
says
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
fees
and
expenses
should
be
allowed.
may
i
suggest
too
your
honors
in
that
connection
that
as
i
have
trouble
going
through
that
theory,
i
likened
it
to
this
as
a
possibility.
in
your
experience
and
of
course
all
litigators,
are
will
and
trust
construction
cases
in
which
the
testator
drafts
his
will
or
trusts
as
preferred
and
there's
an
ambiguity
and
it
has
cause,
there
was
lawyers
cause.
then
the
expense
of
resolving
that
ambiguity
is
assessed
against
the
estate
and
perhaps
that
maybe
inevitable,
whereby
the
securities
and
exchange
commission's
suggestions
to
this
court
may
possibly
be
accommodated.
now,
it
seems
inconceivable
though
to
us,
of
course
i'm
an
advocate
that
it
seems
inconceivable
to
me
because
i'm
advocating
for
a
client.
but
try
to
be
as
candid
as
i
possibly
can,
i
can't
conceive
of
a
situation
in
which
fairness,
the
--
it's
not
a
--
i
want
to
say
it
was
a
defense.
it's
a
factor
to
take
into
consideration
in
the
element
resolution
of
the
whole
case.
as
we
complain
in
our
brief,
we
tried
--
we
tried
--
we
tried
before
his
honor
judge
parsons
in
the
district
court
to
have
this
case
set
for
trial
on
all
three
counts
not
on
these
motions
for
limited
findings
on
summary
judgment
and
then
a
reference
to
the
whole
case
to
a
master
with
no
limitations
to
the
master,
no
guidelines
to
the
master
and
what
he
was
going
to
decide
on
the
causation
and
result.
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
holds
--
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
reference
to
a
master
here
had
to
follow
with
the
ordered.
but
not
only
because
of
the
summary
judgment
order
but
also
because
there
were
no
guidelines
in
referring
this
case
to
a
master
to
tell
the
judge
--
the
court
what
the
relief
was
going
to
be.
when
i
may
by
opening
to
say
that
this
was
a
live
case
pertaining
to
this
court,
many
problems
i
had
in
mind,
the
procedures
were
followed
here.
we've
never
had
a
trial.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
we
did
if
your
honor
pleases
and
we
made
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no.
that
isn't
our
position.
i
don't
want
to
be
fictitious
if
your
honor
pleases.
it
wasn't
wrong
because
it
was
a
summary
judgment.
it
was
wrong
because
questions
of
fact
were
presented
that
could
not
be
resolved
by
summary
judgment
but
which
were
in
fact
resolved
by
summary
judgment
that
there
were
considerations
and
factors
to
be
taken
into
consideration
by
the
court
which
he
did
not
take
any
consideration.
one
factor
being
if
your
honor
pleases
is
the
question
of
fairness
of
mr.
shure's
of
how
you're
going
to
determine
what's
in
the
mind
of
a
shareholder
who
voted
for
this
merger.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
certainly
do
if
your
honor
pleases.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i'm
not--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes.
and
that's
did
not
petition
this
court
for
cross
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
we're
attempting
to
sustain
the
court
of
appeals
in
so
far
as
the
court
of
appeals
granted
summary
judgment
that
we
should
earn
title
to
a
trial
on
all
the
issues
in
the
case.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
may
i
try
to
put
it
this
way
if
your
honor
pleases.
you're
very
precise
and
i
would
--
i'd
like
and
if
i
can
answer
it
precisely.
it
is
our
position
that
causation,
effect
and
materiality
are
one
ball
of
wax
that
you
really
can't
separate
them.
and
when
the
court
separates
them
as
was
done
here
by
way
of
--
particularly
when
a
resort
is
lying
to
summary
judgment
and
you
held
these
major
considerations
had
bear
on
materiality
excise
and
under
consideration
by
the
judge
on
the
issue
of
so
called
materiality,
you
get
the
case
all
segmented.
and
a
badge,
a
scarlet
letter
is
placed
on
the
bag--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
only
to
the
extent
that
the
nature
of
that
which
was
not
included
in
the
proxy
statement
or
the
mis-emphasis
in
the
proxy
statement
has
a
bearing
on
causation.
i
hope
i
don't
sound
as
though
i'm
double
talking.
it's
a
factor
in
this
whole
ball
of
wax
if
it
be
considered
when
it
makes
--
the
court
makes
a
settlement
judgment
should
you
unscramble
or
as
mr.
shure
where
he
would
like
to
have
this
court
hold
this
is
a
violation
of
section
14
(a)
and
therefore,
this
proxies
don't
mean
anything,
there
has
to
be
what
he
call
as
restitution
that
is
a
determination
that
you
take
this
company
not
as
a
viable
company
earning
money
or
trying
to
earn
money
but
as
a
sack
of
assets.
and
you
determine
--
we're
now
applying
that
formula.
as
of
that
day,
this
--
if
it
happened
in
liquidation
and
distribution
as
of
that
day,
this
once
would've
fall
money
wise.
and
you
don't
pay
any
tax.
and
what
did
happen
in
the
meantime
even
though
it's
here
because
of
the
soundness
of
the
plan
of
merger
and
placing
these
two
companies
together
that
this
share
of
this
day
worth
twice
as
much
as
what
they
were
when
the
shareholders
overwhelmingly
94%
voted
in
favor
of
this
merger.
mr.
shure
wants
to
cut
things
off
especially
he
wants
to
cut
off
fairness.
all
we've
been
seeking
to
do
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
gave
us.
we
did
not
point
the
way
we
wanted
it
but
we
can
live
with
it
at
trial
on
all
of
these
issues
not
so
what
we're
seeking.
and
we
thank
the
court
of
appeals
gave
it
to
us
and
we
think
mr.
shure
is
seeking
to
urge
this
court
to
diagnose.
do
any
of
your
honors
have
any
further
questions?
thank
you.
