you
said
mr.

in
the

you
have
a

is
it
known
in
advance
just
what
the
figure
will
be?
justice

exactly
predictable.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
i
could
ask
a
question.
isn't
the
only
question
here
now
at
this
stage
is
the
question
standing
to
raise
this
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
that
what
was
decided
by
the
lower
board
that
there
was
no
standing?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
it
has
not
decided
the
merits?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
my
point
is
this
is
a
matter
that's
all
before
us.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
naturally
you
like
to
have
it
but
i
still
ask
whether
the
only
issues
--
the
only
question
that
decided
on
the
lower
court
was
standing.
justice
john
m.
harlan
therefore
i
would
assume
that
you
disagree
with
lower
court
and
there
are
no
standings
involved
and
you
have
already
told
that.
merits
will
go
back
to
the
lower
court
for
determination.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
the
court
decided
them
then
the
court
of
appeals
did
it.
