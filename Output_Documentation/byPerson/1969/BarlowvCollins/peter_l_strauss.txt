mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
start
if
i
may
with
something
in
the
nature
of
a
counter
statement
of
certain
factual
propositions
that
bear
on
this
case
and
which
i
think
put
it
in
something
of
a
perspective.
first,
although
i
think
it
was
clear
from
petitioners’
oral
presentation
and
perhaps
it
had
been
in
their
briefs.
it
should
be
clear
that
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
new
program,
the
1965
program
and
not
a
program
which
has
been
running
since
1938.
petitioners
have
no
right
to
make
assignments
to
their
cotton
payments
except
under
the
1965
act.
the
right
of
assignment
was
new.
they
have
never
used
it
except
under
circumstances
in
which
they
were
permitted
to
make
assignments
to
pay
for
cash
rent
because
the
regulation
that
permitted
them
to
make
those
assignments
for
that
purpose
was
adopted
prior
to
the
first
crop
year,
the
crop
year
of
1966
to
which
the
upland
cotton
program
of
1965
applied.
they
have
not
been
able
to
make
assignments
at
least
since
commodity
payments
seized
under
the
1938
act
and
in
the
very
early
1940's.
now
they
can
do
so
and
terms
in
which
they
can
do
so
has
not
been
materially
changed
since
that
program
began.
the
second
and
really
part
of
the
first
observation
is
that
there
has
been
no
continuity
in
the
administration
of
assignments
provisions
generally.
section
8
(g)
was
passed
in
1938
through
1941,
literally
hundreds
of
thousands
of
assignments
were
made
every
year
and
that
year
the
war
began.
it
was
no
longer
necessary
to
make
commodity
payments
in
order
to
secure
agricultural
prosperity
and
congress
seized
to
do
so.
the
assignment
fell
dramatically
and
by
1952
when
statistics
seized
to
be
kept
and
when
the
secretary
of
agriculture
went
to
the
congress
and
said
“i
don’t
need
this
statute
anymore,
wipe
it
off
the
books.”
by
1952
only
2,100
assignments
were
made
under
that
act
in
that
year.
so
that
there
was
an
effect
a
20-year
hiatus
between
the
end
of
practical
importance
for
section
8
(g)
and
the
enactment
of
the
1965
act
which
the
government’s
position
is
the
only
act
in
issue
in
this
case
and
we
think
that
has
some
substantial
bearing
on
the
issues
before
the
court.
the
third
thing
and
i
think
discuss
to
some
extent
mr.
justice
white
to
the
questions
you
were
asking
is
that
there
has
been
a
radical
shift
in
ten-year
pattern
even
among
those
who
rent
the
land
they
farm
since
1938.
now
we
pointed
out
in
a
footnote
to
our
brief,
it's
on
page
32,
footnote
22
that
in
1935
42%
of
all
farmers
were
tenants
and
they
farmed
32%
of
this
nations
land.
by
1964,
their
place
had
been
taken
by
part
owners.
part
owners
are
farmers
who
own
some
land
and
rent
other
land
typically
for
cash.
in
the
1964,
part
owners
outnumbered
tenants
and
they
farmed
almost
four
times
as
much
land.
now
at
the
time
that
we
wrote
the
brief,
i
had
not
been
able
to
find
statistics
relating
to
cotton
farming
and
footnotes
note
that
fact.
since
that
time,
i
haven't
able
to
find
such
statistics
on
a
statewide
basis
and
if
the
court
please,
i
should
like
briefly
just
to
mention
the
ones
which
strike
me
as
being
significant.
they
are
from
the
census
figures
which
are
compiled
on
a
statewide
basis
by
the
department
of
commerce
and
something
called
the
united
states
census
of
agriculture.
in
1964,
census
of
agriculture
for
alabama
shows
that
33%
of
the
commercial
farms
in
that
state
raising
cotton
were
operated
by
part
owners
and
these
cotton
farms,
this
33%
of
alabama's
cotton
farmers
who
have
rent
obligations.
these
cotton
farms
held
53%
of
the
states
cotton
land,
that's
over
half.
on
the
other
hand,
cash
tenants,
the
other
major
group,
the
only
other
major
group
with
a
cash
rent
obligation
were
only
11%
of
the
states
commercial
cotton
farmers
and
they
farmed
only
7%
of
its
land.
the
figures
i'm
referring
to
are
derived
from
numerical
figures
that
appear
on
pages
64
and
65
of
this
volume
and
if
the
court
pleases,
i
have
xerox
copies
of
these
pages
which
i've
already
given
to
counsel
and
which
i
will
leave
with
the
clerk.
the
point
is
there
are
over
twice
as
many
part
owners
as
cash
tenants
in
1965
and
they
farmed
over
seven
times
as
much
cotton
land.
one
could
go
on
at
considerable
length
but
the
point
is
a
simple
one,
petitioners
are
not
facing
the
changed
interpretation
of
an
established
program
under
an
old
statute
in
which
they
have
long
participated.
they
are
complaining
of
the
initial
interpretation
of
a
new
program
which
was
passed
and
which
applies
and
conditions
very
different
from
those
which
existed
when
the
(inaudible)
bond
statute
on
which
it
happens
to
draw
was
passed.
the
assignments
statute
was
in
1965
was
not
a
tenant
statute
and
it's
interpretation
even
as
respect
assignments
to
finance
the
farming
cost
of
cash
rent
primarily
effect
others,
part
owners
and
not
cash
tenants.
to
get
back
to
the
other
point
of
the
questions
you
were
asking
justice
white
regarding
well,
why
has
the
secretary
done
this?
what
about
the
protection
of
tenants,
petitioners
who
were
complaining
in
the
course
of
their
colloquy
with
you
that
he
had
adopted
no
regulations
to
provide
for
the
protection
of
tenants?
this
was
meant
to
apply
to
all
farmers
with
cash
rent
obligations
as
a
whole.
of
course
there
are
regulations
which
were
adopted
for
the
upland
cotton
program
and
precisely
in
the
same
time
and
the
same
volume
of
the
federal
register
on
the
same
page,
perhaps
one
or
two
pages
before
as
the
assignment
provision.
they
are
set
out
on
page
46
of
our
brief
and
they
provide
the
diversion
and
price
support
assignments
or
payments
rather
shall
not
be
approved
for
payment
by
county
committee
if
the
county
committee
determines
among
other
things
that
there
exists
between
the
landlord
and
any
tenant
or
sharecropper
any
lease
contract
agreement
or
understanding
unfairly
exacted
or
required
by
the
landlord
which
was
entered
into
an
anticipation
of
participating
in
the
program.
the
effect
of
which
is
to
force
the
tenant
or
sharecropper
to
pay
over
to
the
landlord
any
payment
earned
by
him
under
the
program.
to
change
the
status
of
any
tenant
or
sharecropper
so
that
to
deprive
him
of
any
payment
or
right
which
he
would
have
otherwise
had
had
under
the
program
to
decrease
the
rent
to
be
paid
by
the
tenant
--
to
increase
rather
the
payment
to
be
paid
by
the
tenant
or
to
decrease
the
share
of
the
crop
or
its
proceeds
to
be
received
by
the
sharecropper.
now
of
course
disagreements
could
exist,
they
are
not
present
in
the
allegations
with
the
legal
contentions
in
this
case.
disagreements
could
exist
as
to
whether
those
regulations
are
sufficient,
whether
they
are
properly
enforced
and
obviously
i
don't
believe
that
that's
the
case.
petitioners
do
and
i'm
sure
that
there
could
be
reasonable
arguments
about
the
question
but
what
strikes
me
as
being
significant
to
this
case
is
that
the
petitioners
will
have
no
part
of
those
regulations
and
petitioners
will
have
no
part
of
the
section
under
which
they
were
adopted
7
u.s.c.
1444
(d)
10
which
does
specifically
provide
that
the
secretary
of
agriculture
must
provide
adequate
safeguards
to
protect
the
interests
of
tenants
and
sharecroppers.
they
don't
argue
for
standing
under
that
provision
for
example,
their
argument
isn't;
well
now
here's
a
provision
that
says
the
secretary
must
protect
the
tenants.
therefore,
we
have
standing,
that's
not
their
argument
nor
do
they
argue
that
way
on
the
merit.
the
secretary
has
failed
to
protect
them.
of
course,
it
may
be
significant
that
that
provision
only
requires
adequate
safeguards.
there
is
a
little
bit
of
legislative
history
which
petitioners
cite
in
part
--
quote
in
part
in
their
brief
i
believe
it's
at
page
20
and
21
of
their
brief.
petitioners
quote
in
part
a
house
report
from
the
soil
bank
program
at
page
39
of
that
report.
they
quote
the
sentence
that
said
“no
single
problem
connected
with
the
proposed
soil
bank
has
caused
the
committee
more
concern
than
that
of
guaranteeing
adequate
protection
of
tenants
and
sharecroppers
under
the
program.”
the
next
following
sentence
in
the
report
is
as
follows
“several
provisions
referring
to
tenants
and
sharecroppers
had
intended
to
protect
their
interests
while
at
the
same
time
safeguarding
the
interests
to
landlords
with
scattered
throughout
the
soil
bank
provisions
of
the
senate
bill
and
then
several
other
sentences
also
in
that
report
carry
out
the
same
theme.
congress
is
not
interested
simply
and
only
in
the
safeguarding
the
interest
of
tenants
that
they
realize
that
landlords
have
interests
too
and
therefore
they
provide
for
adequate
protection.
the
secretary
has
a
responsibility
adequately
to
protect
the
interests
of
tenants
and
sharecroppers
and
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
i
am.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no
i
don't
to
the
extent
that
--
i
think
it
was
made
clear
in
our
--
from
the
beginning
of
this
court
in
our
opposition
to
the
petition
for
right
of
certiorari
and
in
our
brief
we
defend
the
decision
below
on
standing
on
hardin
grounds.
we
don’t
think
this
case
does
fall
within
hardin.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
section
d
(10)
does
say
that
there
has
to
be
adequate
protection
for
tenants.
petitioners
though
do
not
invoke
that
section
and
i
think
they
don't
do
so
advisably
and
i
would
hardly
wish
to.
i
think
if
--
let
me
put
it
this
way
if
that
was
the
section
that
they
invoked,
the
question
on
the
merits
would
be
very
different.
petitioners’
case
on
the
merits,
their
actual
complaint
depends
on
their
being
able
to
characterize
a
section
that
was
passed
in
1965.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
assignment
regulation
was
issued
under
section
(d)
13
of
course.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right,
which
are
section
590
(g)
or
section
8
(g)
of
the
1938
act.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
would
have
to
disagree,
i
think
in
a
formal
sense,
what
you
say
is
true
but
since
that
statute
went
out
of
lost
practical
meaning
in
1942
and
was
in
effect
abandoned
by
the
secretary
in
1952.
since
these
regulations
were
adopted
in
1965
immediately
following
the
enactment
of
the
upland
cotton
program
in
that
year.
excuse
me
it
was
february
of
1966,
immediately
following
the
adoption
of
the
upland
cotton
program.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
we
view
this
as
the
interpretation
of
the
upland
cotton
act.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
the
statute
was
passed
in
order
to
facilitate
the
activities
of
farmers
in
financing
their
expenses.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
in
1965
particularly,
i
think
congress
was
well
aware
that
it
was
cutting
by
almost
30%
the
level
of
support
that
farmers
were
receiving
under
the
act
and
they
were
going
to
need
new
finances.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
in
1960,
--
oh
i
don't
--
i
fully
admit
that
they
are
within
the
group
that
this
section
was
intended
to
benefit
but
i
have
not
understood
hardin
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
failed
to
benefit
us.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
my
understanding
of
hardin
was
that
it
referred
rather
specifically
not
to
for
that
matter
this
court's
prior
cases.
it
referred
rather
specifically
not
to
a
simple
matter
of
benefiting
but
rather
an
issue
of
protection.
the
language
which
this
court
used
in
hardin
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
6
of
the
opinion
as
it
appears
in
volume
390
is
that
when
the
particular
statutory
and
the
particular
statutory
provision
invoked
does
reflect
the
legislative
purpose
to
protect
a
competitive
interests,
the
injured
competitor
has
standing.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
this
is
not
a
competition
case
and
nor
do
we
contend
that
hardin
is
restricted
to
competition
cases.
we
do
think
however
that
there
is
some
function
to
be
served
and
we
think
we
observed
that
function
being
served
by
a
limitation
in
those
terms
in
protection
terms
in
keeping
people
from
injury
rather
than
perhaps
in
failing
to
do
for
with
them
everything
that
they
think
ought
to
be
done
for
them
under
a
beneficial
federal
program.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
i
do
and
i'm
not
objecting
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
we
are
just
talking
about
a
hardin
type
of
question.
i
think
what
this
court
having
heard
the
argument
yesterday
in
--
having
heard
the
argument
yesterday
in
the
adapso
case.
i
went
back
and
did
a
little
homework
that
perhaps
i
should
have
done
before.
what
this
court
said
in
stark
and
wickard
is
rather
to
the
point
in
this
regard.
there
it
had
to
deal
rather
expressly
with
what
seems
to
me
just
this
problem,
it's
part
of
the
same
problem
then
came
up
in
abbot,
what
is
the
relationship
between
what
this
court
has
frequently
said
is
the
presumption
of
judicial
review
on
the
one
hand
and
standing
on
the
other
hand.
and
the
court
was
quite
careful
in
that
case
as
it
was
i
think
in
abbot
itself
to
distinguish
between
the
two
situations
to
say
that
before
we
get
to
the
question
of
judicial
review
or
reviewability,
we
have
to
resolve
standing
and
then
it
went
on
to
say
that
the
court
was
very
far
from
assuming
that
the
courts
are
charged
more
than
administrators
or
legislators
with
the
protection
of
the
rights
of
the
people.
under
article
3,
congress
established
courts
to
adjudicate
cases
and
controversies
as
to
claims
of
infringement
of
individual
right.
that
is
that
there
must
be
--
there
must
be
some
special
claims
on
nexus
as
the
court
has
put
it
in
jenkins
versus
mckeithen
just
last
term.
i
have
that
here
some
place.
the
court
said
that
something
more
than
an
adversary
interest
is
necessary
to
confer
standing.
there
must
be
some
connection
between
the
official
action
challenged
and
some
legally
protected
interest
of
the
party
challenging
that
action.
again
protection,
i
can't
imagine
that
those
words
are
casually
used.
in
every
one
of
these
courts,
this
court's
opinion
has
also
been
an
emphasis
on
specificity
and
i
can't
imagine
that
either
was
inadvertent.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
has
always
restrained
itself
from
the
position
of
appearing
to
be
a
general
overseer
of
the
conduct
of
government
business.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
that’s
certainly
true.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
maybe
i
should
start
with
another.
if
i
may,
this
is
in
response
to
your
question
i
think.
it
is
quite
clear
isn't
it
that
if
petitioners
or
rather
if
you
are
right.
if
the
directions
of
your
questions
are
leading,
it
won't
be
only
petitioners
that
have
standing.
it
will
be
every
farmer
in
the
country,
every
cotton
farmer
in
the
country
who
is
displeased
by
something
the
secretary
of
agriculture
has
done.
who
thinks
that
he
ought
to
have
gotten
more,
that
the
level
of
benefits
set
off
to
have
been
a
little
higher
who
will
have
standing
to
come
in
because
it's
quite
clear
that
in
a
benefit
context
this
statute
is
meant
to
benefit.
not
just
tenants
and
deep
principally
people
other
than
tenants.
even
among
those
who
pay
cash
rent
principally
people
other
than
tenant,
so
that
were
not
talking
about
just
tenants
versus
nobody.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
all
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
in
fact
if
that
had
happened,
i
assume
that
the
much
more
numerous
part
owners
would
have
been
arguing
just
that
way.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
they
have
no
standing.
it
seemed
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
oh
certainly!
we
certainly
do.
it's
either
all
farmers
or
none
and
we
think
in
that
situation
the
choice
is
none
that
this
court's
cases
have
traditionally
and
consistently
limited
standing
to
the
area
of
protection
and
not
simple
benefits.
and
indeed
we
don't
understand
petitioners
to
argue
differently
because
they
seem
to
be
arguing
that
either
tenants
will
be
able
to
get
review
or
no
one.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
court
did
grant
certiorari
on
the
question
of
the
merits
when
it
was
merited
in
the
petition
and
i
don't
think
i
would
suggest
that
it
was
improper
for
it
to
do
so.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
don't
think
so
although
again
i
would
have
to
agree
with
the
petitioners
that
it
certainly
gave
some
very
broad
hint
about
where
it's
fused
were.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
he
did
go
on
to
reach
the
merits
but
the
majority
did
decide
in
terms
of
decision.
it
decided
only
that
the
standing
issue.
indeed
in
abbot
laboratory
for
example
the
court
remanded
in
addition
to
the
cases
which
were
cited
in
our
brief.
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no
but
it
was
a
similar
kind
of
situation
in
which
jurisprudential
questions
were
raised.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right
but
at
the
conclusion
of
its
opinion
it
did
then
refuse
to
pass
on
the
merits
although
it
had
been
pressed
to
do
so
in
the
merits.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
certainly
true,
certainly
true.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
both
questions
have
been
argued
by
both
parties
in
this
court,
that's
right.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
jurisdictional
objection
to
the
court
passing
on
the
merits
but
we
do
think
that
ordinary
sound
practice
of
the
court
is
to
wait
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
present
its
view.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
if
i
may
for
a
moment
go
back
to
this
because
i
think
it
--this
matter
is
particularly
revealing
that
we
have
in
section
(d)
10.
a
section
which
said
“now
the
secretary
must
protect
the
tenants”
and
yet
petitioners
aren't
claiming
standing
under
the
section.
they
say
their
standing
as
under
section
(d)
13
because
section
(d)
13
was
meant
to
protect
the
tenants.
why
do
they
that?
there
is
a
reason
for
that
it
seems
to
us,
if
they
relied
on
the
express
obligation
of
the
secretary
instead
of
what
they
think
is
implicit
in
the
assignment
provision
as
the
basis
of
either
of
standing
or
the
merits.
then
they
would
have
to
face
up
to
the
facts
that
the
assignment
provisions
are
not
for
tenants
or
cash
tenants
alone
but
for
all
cotton
farmers.
and
facing
up
to
that
fact,
the
judgment
whether
assignments
to
finance
the
farming
expense
of
cash
rent
are
proper
is
much
more
difficult
than
it
appears
on
the
petitioner's
view
of
the
statute
as
meant
for
tenants
alone.
petitioners
say
in
their
reply
brief
that
the
issue
here
is
whether
landlord
shall
be
allowed
unrestricted
access
to
the
credit
generated
by
federal
benefit.
we
fully
agree
that
the
tenants
--
the
landlords
are
not
to
be
allowed
unrestricted
access.
their
access
is
restricted
and
really
the
question
here
is
by
how
much?
perhaps
the
regulations
which
exist
are
inadequate,
we
don't
think
so
and
petitioners
don't
claim
it.
if
they
did,
we
would
have
to
agree
that
they
were
properly
here,
instead
they
seek
to
block
even
properly
restricted
access
by
landlords
to
assignments
with
the
effect
that
not
only
tenants
would
be
unable
to
make
them
but
also
the
much
more
numerous
class
of
part
owners
who
may
equally
need
this
financing
tool
and
who
are
not
present
on
the
scene
in
1938
when
section
8
(g)
was
passed
and
such
numbers
or
such
forward.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
as
i
was
explaining
to
justice
white
mr.
justice
black,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
choice
of
this
court
faces
--
is
in
part
not
a
choice
between
this
people
and
no
one
but
all
farmers
and
no
one
unless
this
court
is
able
to
find
that
there
is
a
legally
protected
interest,
distinct
from
a
simple
intent
to
benefit.
now
if
this
court
finds
from
the
legislative
history
that
congress
meant
to
protect
the
interests
of
tenants.
specific
interest
of
tenants
in
a
manner
related
to
this
statute
as
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
must
be
done
in
jenkins
versus
mckeithen
and
flast
versus
cohen
and
its
other
cases.
if
there
is
a
legally
protected
interest
which
is
related
in
that
way,
well
of
course
petitioners
have
standing.
that
is
the
issue
here.
if
they
have
no
legally
protected
interest,
if
all
they
have
is
a
simple
claim
to
a
benefit
under
the
act
then
they
have
no
more
standing
than
any
other
farmer.
it's
either
all
farmers
or
none
and
i
think
that
in
the
obvious
the
government's
is
the
government’s
position
on
the
issue.
and
i
would
also
say
to
go
back
to
abbot
laboratory
versus
gardner,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
this
question
--
well
if
this
people
can't
challenge
it,
who
can?
that
question
involve
the
issue
of
reviewability
and
the
issue
of
reviewability
it
seems
to
us
in
abbot,
in
stark,
this
court
has
very
carefully
distinguished
from
the
issue
of
standing
as
the
question
you
get
to
once,
you
decide
that
there
is
a
legally
protected
interest.
then
since
the
interest
is
there,
since
it
is
protected,
since
it's
meant
to
be
honored
by
congress
then
of
course
there
is
some
presumption
that
congress
would
want
those
people
to
be
able
to
go
into
court
and
enforce
it.
but
you
have
to
decide
first
that
the
interest
is
a
protected
one.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
what
i've
just
been
speaking
too?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
i
think
its
part
of
the
standing
issue
that
is
i'm
trying
to
persuade
the
court
that
the
language
in
abbot
is
really
not
language
which
ought
to
be
applied
in
the
standing
issue.
it
is
not
relevant
to
the
question
at
stand.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right
and
was
intended
to
protect
them
in
around
a
very
specific
way.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
i
think
that's
the
issue
on
standing.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
is
also
a
part
of
the
issue
on
the
merits.
obviously
this
are
closely
intertwined
but
as
in
hardin
for
example,
the
court
found
that
on
the
standing
issue
was
the
tba
act
intended
to
protect
certain
competitors
and
the
court
found
that
it
was
in
the
abstract
as
a
legal
proposition.
then
on
the
facts
of
the
case
resoling
disputed
factual
issues
on
the
merits,
it
went
ahead
and
it
said
well
but
nonetheless.
this
treatment
of
this
particular
issue
doesn't
depend
on
the
statute;
well
i
don't
think
there's
any
necessity
to
argue
the
merits
of
length.
i
think
our
arguments
are
fairly
adequately
set
out
in
the
briefs
and
implicit
in
what
i
have
said
before.
i
just
want
to
make
a
couple
of
very
quick
points.
first,
that
we
are
dealing
here,
the
government
insist
were
dealing
here
with
a
1965
statute
not
with
a
1938
statute
and
in
connection
with
that
--
well
this
court
may
decide
that
making
a
crop
means
this
or
that,
we
think
that
the
reasons
we've
set
out
on
the
brief
that
it
very
comfortably
accommodates
what
the
secretary
has
done
but
of
course
the
court
could
disagree
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
just
very
briefly
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well
if
you
wish
me
to
stop,
i
will
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
the
court
could
reach
the
merits
if
it
wish
too
although
its
sound
practice
has
not
been
not
to
do
so
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
don't
see
any
reason
in
this
case
to
do
so.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
points
i
--
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
was
only
this
while
we
think
what
the
secretary
has
done
comes
within
the
comfortable
meaning
of
financing
the
expenses
of
making
a
crop.
expensive
rent
is
an
obvious
expense
of
producing
cotton
or
any
other
crop.
perhaps
this
court
will
disagree
that
would
do
the
government
and
the
law
will
particularly
deserve
it
but
petitioners
make
an
argument
that
it
seems
to
us
to
be
quite
dangerous.
they
say
because
the
secretary
interpreted
this
obscure
provision
of
the
law
in
1938
under
another
program
which
went
out
of
practical
existence
in
1942.
in
a
particular
way
now
we
can't
reinterpret
that
provision
at
all
and
we
think
that
that
proposition
that
congress
in
1965
despite
legislative
history
which
says
absolutely
nothing
about
the
meaning
of
this
provision.
about
how
it
was
applied,
about
whether
it
was
meant
to
protect
tenants
or
not
that
if
this
court
was
to
say
that
nonetheless
it's
reenactment
of
the
statute
in
1965
froze
into
law
the
prior
administrative
interpretation.
that
would
be
an
extraordinarily
harmful
thing
and
this
court
remarked
does
not
particularly
to
our
advantage
as
it
was
in
the
leary
case
last
term.
in
connection
with
leary,
there
was
an
argument,
the
government
made
the
argument
that
the
interpretation
of
the
bureau
of
narcotics
which
had
existed
for
so
long
ought
to
be
confirmed
because
there
was
legislative
reenactment
at
a
subsequent
time
and
much
less
sweeping
propositions
and
since
it
didn't
in
any
way
foreclose
the
possibility
of
future
change.
and
this
court
responded
the
scanty
legislative
history
accompanying
the
reenactment
gives
no
hint
that
congress
knew
of
this
particular
regulations
much
less
the
indirect
impact
now
scribed
to
them.
that
language
is
peculiarly
applicable
here
and
it
seems
to
us
to
say
on
the
basis
of
the
very
scanty
legislative
history
that
it
exists
that
the
prior
interpretation
was
frozen
into
law
would
have
all
kinds
of
untoward
consequences
for
future
administrative
law
cases
bearing
no
resemblance
at
all
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
government
submits
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
start
if
i
may
with
something
in
the
nature
of
a
counter
statement
of
certain
factual
propositions
that
bear
on
this
case
and
which
i
think
put
it
in
something
of
a
perspective.
first,
although
i
think
it
was
clear
from
petitioners’
oral
presentation
and
perhaps
it
had
been
in
their
briefs.
it
should
be
clear
that
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
new
program,
the
1965
program
and
not
a
program
which
has
been
running
since
1938.
petitioners
have
no
right
to
make
assignments
to
their
cotton
payments
except
under
the
1965
act.
the
right
of
assignment
was
new.
they
have
never
used
it
except
under
circumstances
in
which
they
were
permitted
to
make
assignments
to
pay
for
cash
rent
because
the
regulation
that
permitted
them
to
make
those
assignments
for
that
purpose
was
adopted
prior
to
the
first
crop
year,
the
crop
year
of
1966
to
which
the
upland
cotton
program
of
1965
applied.
they
have
not
been
able
to
make
assignments
at
least
since
commodity
payments
seized
under
the
1938
act
and
in
the
very
early
1940's.
now
they
can
do
so
and
terms
in
which
they
can
do
so
has
not
been
materially
changed
since
that
program
began.
the
second
and
really
part
of
the
first
observation
is
that
there
has
been
no
continuity
in
the
administration
of
assignments
provisions
generally.
section
8
(g)
was
passed
in
1938
through
1941,
literally
hundreds
of
thousands
of
assignments
were
made
every
year
and
that
year
the
war
began.
it
was
no
longer
necessary
to
make
commodity
payments
in
order
to
secure
agricultural
prosperity
and
congress
seized
to
do
so.
the
assignment
fell
dramatically
and
by
1952
when
statistics
seized
to
be
kept
and
when
the
secretary
of
agriculture
went
to
the
congress
and
said
“i
don’t
need
this
statute
anymore,
wipe
it
off
the
books.”
by
1952
only
2,100
assignments
were
made
under
that
act
in
that
year.
so
that
there
was
an
effect
a
20-year
hiatus
between
the
end
of
practical
importance
for
section
8
(g)
and
the
enactment
of
the
1965
act
which
the
government’s
position
is
the
only
act
in
issue
in
this
case
and
we
think
that
has
some
substantial
bearing
on
the
issues
before
the
court.
the
third
thing
and
i
think
discuss
to
some
extent
mr.
justice
white
to
the
questions
you
were
asking
is
that
there
has
been
a
radical
shift
in
ten-year
pattern
even
among
those
who
rent
the
land
they
farm
since
1938.
now
we
pointed
out
in
a
footnote
to
our
brief,
it's
on
page
32,
footnote
22
that
in
1935
42%
of
all
farmers
were
tenants
and
they
farmed
32%
of
this
nations
land.
by
1964,
their
place
had
been
taken
by
part
owners.
part
owners
are
farmers
who
own
some
land
and
rent
other
land
typically
for
cash.
in
the
1964,
part
owners
outnumbered
tenants
and
they
farmed
almost
four
times
as
much
land.
now
at
the
time
that
we
wrote
the
brief,
i
had
not
been
able
to
find
statistics
relating
to
cotton
farming
and
footnotes
note
that
fact.
since
that
time,
i
haven't
able
to
find
such
statistics
on
a
statewide
basis
and
if
the
court
please,
i
should
like
briefly
just
to
mention
the
ones
which
strike
me
as
being
significant.
they
are
from
the
census
figures
which
are
compiled
on
a
statewide
basis
by
the
department
of
commerce
and
something
called
the
united
states
census
of
agriculture.
in
1964,
census
of
agriculture
for
alabama
shows
that
33%
of
the
commercial
farms
in
that
state
raising
cotton
were
operated
by
part
owners
and
these
cotton
farms,
this
33%
of
alabama's
cotton
farmers
who
have
rent
obligations.
these
cotton
farms
held
53%
of
the
states
cotton
land,
that's
over
half.
on
the
other
hand,
cash
tenants,
the
other
major
group,
the
only
other
major
group
with
a
cash
rent
obligation
were
only
11%
of
the
states
commercial
cotton
farmers
and
they
farmed
only
7%
of
its
land.
the
figures
i'm
referring
to
are
derived
from
numerical
figures
that
appear
on
pages
64
and
65
of
this
volume
and
if
the
court
pleases,
i
have
xerox
copies
of
these
pages
which
i've
already
given
to
counsel
and
which
i
will
leave
with
the
clerk.
the
point
is
there
are
over
twice
as
many
part
owners
as
cash
tenants
in
1965
and
they
farmed
over
seven
times
as
much
cotton
land.
one
could
go
on
at
considerable
length
but
the
point
is
a
simple
one,
petitioners
are
not
facing
the
changed
interpretation
of
an
established
program
under
an
old
statute
in
which
they
have
long
participated.
they
are
complaining
of
the
initial
interpretation
of
a
new
program
which
was
passed
and
which
applies
and
conditions
very
different
from
those
which
existed
when
the
(inaudible)
bond
statute
on
which
it
happens
to
draw
was
passed.
the
assignments
statute
was
in
1965
was
not
a
tenant
statute
and
it's
interpretation
even
as
respect
assignments
to
finance
the
farming
cost
of
cash
rent
primarily
effect
others,
part
owners
and
not
cash
tenants.
to
get
back
to
the
other
point
of
the
questions
you
were
asking
justice
white
regarding
well,
why
has
the
secretary
done
this?
what
about
the
protection
of
tenants,
petitioners
who
were
complaining
in
the
course
of
their
colloquy
with
you
that
he
had
adopted
no
regulations
to
provide
for
the
protection
of
tenants?
this
was
meant
to
apply
to
all
farmers
with
cash
rent
obligations
as
a
whole.
of
course
there
are
regulations
which
were
adopted
for
the
upland
cotton
program
and
precisely
in
the
same
time
and
the
same
volume
of
the
federal
register
on
the
same
page,
perhaps
one
or
two
pages
before
as
the
assignment
provision.
they
are
set
out
on
page
46
of
our
brief
and
they
provide
the
diversion
and
price
support
assignments
or
payments
rather
shall
not
be
approved
for
payment
by
county
committee
if
the
county
committee
determines
among
other
things
that
there
exists
between
the
landlord
and
any
tenant
or
sharecropper
any
lease
contract
agreement
or
understanding
unfairly
exacted
or
required
by
the
landlord
which
was
entered
into
an
anticipation
of
participating
in
the
program.
the
effect
of
which
is
to
force
the
tenant
or
sharecropper
to
pay
over
to
the
landlord
any
payment
earned
by
him
under
the
program.
to
change
the
status
of
any
tenant
or
sharecropper
so
that
to
deprive
him
of
any
payment
or
right
which
he
would
have
otherwise
had
had
under
the
program
to
decrease
the
rent
to
be
paid
by
the
tenant
--
to
increase
rather
the
payment
to
be
paid
by
the
tenant
or
to
decrease
the
share
of
the
crop
or
its
proceeds
to
be
received
by
the
sharecropper.
now
of
course
disagreements
could
exist,
they
are
not
present
in
the
allegations
with
the
legal
contentions
in
this
case.
disagreements
could
exist
as
to
whether
those
regulations
are
sufficient,
whether
they
are
properly
enforced
and
obviously
i
don't
believe
that
that's
the
case.
petitioners
do
and
i'm
sure
that
there
could
be
reasonable
arguments
about
the
question
but
what
strikes
me
as
being
significant
to
this
case
is
that
the
petitioners
will
have
no
part
of
those
regulations
and
petitioners
will
have
no
part
of
the
section
under
which
they
were
adopted
7
u.s.c.
1444
(d)
10
which
does
specifically
provide
that
the
secretary
of
agriculture
must
provide
adequate
safeguards
to
protect
the
interests
of
tenants
and
sharecroppers.
they
don't
argue
for
standing
under
that
provision
for
example,
their
argument
isn't;
well
now
here's
a
provision
that
says
the
secretary
must
protect
the
tenants.
therefore,
we
have
standing,
that's
not
their
argument
nor
do
they
argue
that
way
on
the
merit.
the
secretary
has
failed
to
protect
them.
of
course,
it
may
be
significant
that
that
provision
only
requires
adequate
safeguards.
there
is
a
little
bit
of
legislative
history
which
petitioners
cite
in
part
--
quote
in
part
in
their
brief
i
believe
it's
at
page
20
and
21
of
their
brief.
petitioners
quote
in
part
a
house
report
from
the
soil
bank
program
at
page
39
of
that
report.
they
quote
the
sentence
that
said
“no
single
problem
connected
with
the
proposed
soil
bank
has
caused
the
committee
more
concern
than
that
of
guaranteeing
adequate
protection
of
tenants
and
sharecroppers
under
the
program.”
the
next
following
sentence
in
the
report
is
as
follows
“several
provisions
referring
to
tenants
and
sharecroppers
had
intended
to
protect
their
interests
while
at
the
same
time
safeguarding
the
interests
to
landlords
with
scattered
throughout
the
soil
bank
provisions
of
the
senate
bill
and
then
several
other
sentences
also
in
that
report
carry
out
the
same
theme.
congress
is
not
interested
simply
and
only
in
the
safeguarding
the
interest
of
tenants
that
they
realize
that
landlords
have
interests
too
and
therefore
they
provide
for
adequate
protection.
the
secretary
has
a
responsibility
adequately
to
protect
the
interests
of
tenants
and
sharecroppers
and
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
i
am.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no
i
don't
to
the
extent
that
--
i
think
it
was
made
clear
in
our
--
from
the
beginning
of
this
court
in
our
opposition
to
the
petition
for
right
of
certiorari
and
in
our
brief
we
defend
the
decision
below
on
standing
on
hardin
grounds.
we
don’t
think
this
case
does
fall
within
hardin.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
section
d
(10)
does
say
that
there
has
to
be
adequate
protection
for
tenants.
petitioners
though
do
not
invoke
that
section
and
i
think
they
don't
do
so
advisably
and
i
would
hardly
wish
to.
i
think
if
--
let
me
put
it
this
way
if
that
was
the
section
that
they
invoked,
the
question
on
the
merits
would
be
very
different.
petitioners’
case
on
the
merits,
their
actual
complaint
depends
on
their
being
able
to
characterize
a
section
that
was
passed
in
1965.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
assignment
regulation
was
issued
under
section
(d)
13
of
course.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right,
which
are
section
590
(g)
or
section
8
(g)
of
the
1938
act.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
would
have
to
disagree,
i
think
in
a
formal
sense,
what
you
say
is
true
but
since
that
statute
went
out
of
lost
practical
meaning
in
1942
and
was
in
effect
abandoned
by
the
secretary
in
1952.
since
these
regulations
were
adopted
in
1965
immediately
following
the
enactment
of
the
upland
cotton
program
in
that
year.
excuse
me
it
was
february
of
1966,
immediately
following
the
adoption
of
the
upland
cotton
program.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
we
view
this
as
the
interpretation
of
the
upland
cotton
act.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
the
statute
was
passed
in
order
to
facilitate
the
activities
of
farmers
in
financing
their
expenses.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
in
1965
particularly,
i
think
congress
was
well
aware
that
it
was
cutting
by
almost
30%
the
level
of
support
that
farmers
were
receiving
under
the
act
and
they
were
going
to
need
new
finances.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
in
1960,
--
oh
i
don't
--
i
fully
admit
that
they
are
within
the
group
that
this
section
was
intended
to
benefit
but
i
have
not
understood
hardin
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
failed
to
benefit
us.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
my
understanding
of
hardin
was
that
it
referred
rather
specifically
not
to
for
that
matter
this
court's
prior
cases.
it
referred
rather
specifically
not
to
a
simple
matter
of
benefiting
but
rather
an
issue
of
protection.
the
language
which
this
court
used
in
hardin
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
6
of
the
opinion
as
it
appears
in
volume
390
is
that
when
the
particular
statutory
and
the
particular
statutory
provision
invoked
does
reflect
the
legislative
purpose
to
protect
a
competitive
interests,
the
injured
competitor
has
standing.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
this
is
not
a
competition
case
and
nor
do
we
contend
that
hardin
is
restricted
to
competition
cases.
we
do
think
however
that
there
is
some
function
to
be
served
and
we
think
we
observed
that
function
being
served
by
a
limitation
in
those
terms
in
protection
terms
in
keeping
people
from
injury
rather
than
perhaps
in
failing
to
do
for
with
them
everything
that
they
think
ought
to
be
done
for
them
under
a
beneficial
federal
program.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
i
do
and
i'm
not
objecting
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
we
are
just
talking
about
a
hardin
type
of
question.
i
think
what
this
court
having
heard
the
argument
yesterday
in
--
having
heard
the
argument
yesterday
in
the
adapso
case.
i
went
back
and
did
a
little
homework
that
perhaps
i
should
have
done
before.
what
this
court
said
in
stark
and
wickard
is
rather
to
the
point
in
this
regard.
there
it
had
to
deal
rather
expressly
with
what
seems
to
me
just
this
problem,
it's
part
of
the
same
problem
then
came
up
in
abbot,
what
is
the
relationship
between
what
this
court
has
frequently
said
is
the
presumption
of
judicial
review
on
the
one
hand
and
standing
on
the
other
hand.
and
the
court
was
quite
careful
in
that
case
as
it
was
i
think
in
abbot
itself
to
distinguish
between
the
two
situations
to
say
that
before
we
get
to
the
question
of
judicial
review
or
reviewability,
we
have
to
resolve
standing
and
then
it
went
on
to
say
that
the
court
was
very
far
from
assuming
that
the
courts
are
charged
more
than
administrators
or
legislators
with
the
protection
of
the
rights
of
the
people.
under
article
3,
congress
established
courts
to
adjudicate
cases
and
controversies
as
to
claims
of
infringement
of
individual
right.
that
is
that
there
must
be
--
there
must
be
some
special
claims
on
nexus
as
the
court
has
put
it
in
jenkins
versus
mckeithen
just
last
term.
i
have
that
here
some
place.
the
court
said
that
something
more
than
an
adversary
interest
is
necessary
to
confer
standing.
there
must
be
some
connection
between
the
official
action
challenged
and
some
legally
protected
interest
of
the
party
challenging
that
action.
again
protection,
i
can't
imagine
that
those
words
are
casually
used.
in
every
one
of
these
courts,
this
court's
opinion
has
also
been
an
emphasis
on
specificity
and
i
can't
imagine
that
either
was
inadvertent.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
has
always
restrained
itself
from
the
position
of
appearing
to
be
a
general
overseer
of
the
conduct
of
government
business.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
that’s
certainly
true.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
maybe
i
should
start
with
another.
if
i
may,
this
is
in
response
to
your
question
i
think.
it
is
quite
clear
isn't
it
that
if
petitioners
or
rather
if
you
are
right.
if
the
directions
of
your
questions
are
leading,
it
won't
be
only
petitioners
that
have
standing.
it
will
be
every
farmer
in
the
country,
every
cotton
farmer
in
the
country
who
is
displeased
by
something
the
secretary
of
agriculture
has
done.
who
thinks
that
he
ought
to
have
gotten
more,
that
the
level
of
benefits
set
off
to
have
been
a
little
higher
who
will
have
standing
to
come
in
because
it's
quite
clear
that
in
a
benefit
context
this
statute
is
meant
to
benefit.
not
just
tenants
and
deep
principally
people
other
than
tenants.
even
among
those
who
pay
cash
rent
principally
people
other
than
tenant,
so
that
were
not
talking
about
just
tenants
versus
nobody.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
all
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
in
fact
if
that
had
happened,
i
assume
that
the
much
more
numerous
part
owners
would
have
been
arguing
just
that
way.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
they
have
no
standing.
it
seemed
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
oh
certainly!
we
certainly
do.
it's
either
all
farmers
or
none
and
we
think
in
that
situation
the
choice
is
none
that
this
court's
cases
have
traditionally
and
consistently
limited
standing
to
the
area
of
protection
and
not
simple
benefits.
and
indeed
we
don't
understand
petitioners
to
argue
differently
because
they
seem
to
be
arguing
that
either
tenants
will
be
able
to
get
review
or
no
one.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
court
did
grant
certiorari
on
the
question
of
the
merits
when
it
was
merited
in
the
petition
and
i
don't
think
i
would
suggest
that
it
was
improper
for
it
to
do
so.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
don't
think
so
although
again
i
would
have
to
agree
with
the
petitioners
that
it
certainly
gave
some
very
broad
hint
about
where
it's
fused
were.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
he
did
go
on
to
reach
the
merits
but
the
majority
did
decide
in
terms
of
decision.
it
decided
only
that
the
standing
issue.
indeed
in
abbot
laboratory
for
example
the
court
remanded
in
addition
to
the
cases
which
were
cited
in
our
brief.
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no
but
it
was
a
similar
kind
of
situation
in
which
jurisprudential
questions
were
raised.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right
but
at
the
conclusion
of
its
opinion
it
did
then
refuse
to
pass
on
the
merits
although
it
had
been
pressed
to
do
so
in
the
merits.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
certainly
true,
certainly
true.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
both
questions
have
been
argued
by
both
parties
in
this
court,
that's
right.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
jurisdictional
objection
to
the
court
passing
on
the
merits
but
we
do
think
that
ordinary
sound
practice
of
the
court
is
to
wait
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
present
its
view.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
if
i
may
for
a
moment
go
back
to
this
because
i
think
it
--this
matter
is
particularly
revealing
that
we
have
in
section
(d)
10.
a
section
which
said
“now
the
secretary
must
protect
the
tenants”
and
yet
petitioners
aren't
claiming
standing
under
the
section.
they
say
their
standing
as
under
section
(d)
13
because
section
(d)
13
was
meant
to
protect
the
tenants.
why
do
they
that?
there
is
a
reason
for
that
it
seems
to
us,
if
they
relied
on
the
express
obligation
of
the
secretary
instead
of
what
they
think
is
implicit
in
the
assignment
provision
as
the
basis
of
either
of
standing
or
the
merits.
then
they
would
have
to
face
up
to
the
facts
that
the
assignment
provisions
are
not
for
tenants
or
cash
tenants
alone
but
for
all
cotton
farmers.
and
facing
up
to
that
fact,
the
judgment
whether
assignments
to
finance
the
farming
expense
of
cash
rent
are
proper
is
much
more
difficult
than
it
appears
on
the
petitioner's
view
of
the
statute
as
meant
for
tenants
alone.
petitioners
say
in
their
reply
brief
that
the
issue
here
is
whether
landlord
shall
be
allowed
unrestricted
access
to
the
credit
generated
by
federal
benefit.
we
fully
agree
that
the
tenants
--
the
landlords
are
not
to
be
allowed
unrestricted
access.
their
access
is
restricted
and
really
the
question
here
is
by
how
much?
perhaps
the
regulations
which
exist
are
inadequate,
we
don't
think
so
and
petitioners
don't
claim
it.
if
they
did,
we
would
have
to
agree
that
they
were
properly
here,
instead
they
seek
to
block
even
properly
restricted
access
by
landlords
to
assignments
with
the
effect
that
not
only
tenants
would
be
unable
to
make
them
but
also
the
much
more
numerous
class
of
part
owners
who
may
equally
need
this
financing
tool
and
who
are
not
present
on
the
scene
in
1938
when
section
8
(g)
was
passed
and
such
numbers
or
such
forward.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
as
i
was
explaining
to
justice
white
mr.
justice
black,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
choice
of
this
court
faces
--
is
in
part
not
a
choice
between
this
people
and
no
one
but
all
farmers
and
no
one
unless
this
court
is
able
to
find
that
there
is
a
legally
protected
interest,
distinct
from
a
simple
intent
to
benefit.
now
if
this
court
finds
from
the
legislative
history
that
congress
meant
to
protect
the
interests
of
tenants.
specific
interest
of
tenants
in
a
manner
related
to
this
statute
as
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
must
be
done
in
jenkins
versus
mckeithen
and
flast
versus
cohen
and
its
other
cases.
if
there
is
a
legally
protected
interest
which
is
related
in
that
way,
well
of
course
petitioners
have
standing.
that
is
the
issue
here.
if
they
have
no
legally
protected
interest,
if
all
they
have
is
a
simple
claim
to
a
benefit
under
the
act
then
they
have
no
more
standing
than
any
other
farmer.
it's
either
all
farmers
or
none
and
i
think
that
in
the
obvious
the
government's
is
the
government’s
position
on
the
issue.
and
i
would
also
say
to
go
back
to
abbot
laboratory
versus
gardner,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
this
question
--
well
if
this
people
can't
challenge
it,
who
can?
that
question
involve
the
issue
of
reviewability
and
the
issue
of
reviewability
it
seems
to
us
in
abbot,
in
stark,
this
court
has
very
carefully
distinguished
from
the
issue
of
standing
as
the
question
you
get
to
once,
you
decide
that
there
is
a
legally
protected
interest.
then
since
the
interest
is
there,
since
it
is
protected,
since
it's
meant
to
be
honored
by
congress
then
of
course
there
is
some
presumption
that
congress
would
want
those
people
to
be
able
to
go
into
court
and
enforce
it.
but
you
have
to
decide
first
that
the
interest
is
a
protected
one.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
what
i've
just
been
speaking
too?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
i
think
its
part
of
the
standing
issue
that
is
i'm
trying
to
persuade
the
court
that
the
language
in
abbot
is
really
not
language
which
ought
to
be
applied
in
the
standing
issue.
it
is
not
relevant
to
the
question
at
stand.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right
and
was
intended
to
protect
them
in
around
a
very
specific
way.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
i
think
that's
the
issue
on
standing.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
is
also
a
part
of
the
issue
on
the
merits.
obviously
this
are
closely
intertwined
but
as
in
hardin
for
example,
the
court
found
that
on
the
standing
issue
was
the
tba
act
intended
to
protect
certain
competitors
and
the
court
found
that
it
was
in
the
abstract
as
a
legal
proposition.
then
on
the
facts
of
the
case
resoling
disputed
factual
issues
on
the
merits,
it
went
ahead
and
it
said
well
but
nonetheless.
this
treatment
of
this
particular
issue
doesn't
depend
on
the
statute;
well
i
don't
think
there's
any
necessity
to
argue
the
merits
of
length.
i
think
our
arguments
are
fairly
adequately
set
out
in
the
briefs
and
implicit
in
what
i
have
said
before.
i
just
want
to
make
a
couple
of
very
quick
points.
first,
that
we
are
dealing
here,
the
government
insist
were
dealing
here
with
a
1965
statute
not
with
a
1938
statute
and
in
connection
with
that
--
well
this
court
may
decide
that
making
a
crop
means
this
or
that,
we
think
that
the
reasons
we've
set
out
on
the
brief
that
it
very
comfortably
accommodates
what
the
secretary
has
done
but
of
course
the
court
could
disagree
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
just
very
briefly
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well
if
you
wish
me
to
stop,
i
will
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
the
court
could
reach
the
merits
if
it
wish
too
although
its
sound
practice
has
not
been
not
to
do
so
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
don't
see
any
reason
in
this
case
to
do
so.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
points
i
--
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
was
only
this
while
we
think
what
the
secretary
has
done
comes
within
the
comfortable
meaning
of
financing
the
expenses
of
making
a
crop.
expensive
rent
is
an
obvious
expense
of
producing
cotton
or
any
other
crop.
perhaps
this
court
will
disagree
that
would
do
the
government
and
the
law
will
particularly
deserve
it
but
petitioners
make
an
argument
that
it
seems
to
us
to
be
quite
dangerous.
they
say
because
the
secretary
interpreted
this
obscure
provision
of
the
law
in
1938
under
another
program
which
went
out
of
practical
existence
in
1942.
in
a
particular
way
now
we
can't
reinterpret
that
provision
at
all
and
we
think
that
that
proposition
that
congress
in
1965
despite
legislative
history
which
says
absolutely
nothing
about
the
meaning
of
this
provision.
about
how
it
was
applied,
about
whether
it
was
meant
to
protect
tenants
or
not
that
if
this
court
was
to
say
that
nonetheless
it's
reenactment
of
the
statute
in
1965
froze
into
law
the
prior
administrative
interpretation.
that
would
be
an
extraordinarily
harmful
thing
and
this
court
remarked
does
not
particularly
to
our
advantage
as
it
was
in
the
leary
case
last
term.
in
connection
with
leary,
there
was
an
argument,
the
government
made
the
argument
that
the
interpretation
of
the
bureau
of
narcotics
which
had
existed
for
so
long
ought
to
be
confirmed
because
there
was
legislative
reenactment
at
a
subsequent
time
and
much
less
sweeping
propositions
and
since
it
didn't
in
any
way
foreclose
the
possibility
of
future
change.
and
this
court
responded
the
scanty
legislative
history
accompanying
the
reenactment
gives
no
hint
that
congress
knew
of
this
particular
regulations
much
less
the
indirect
impact
now
scribed
to
them.
that
language
is
peculiarly
applicable
here
and
it
seems
to
us
to
say
on
the
basis
of
the
very
scanty
legislative
history
that
it
exists
that
the
prior
interpretation
was
frozen
into
law
would
have
all
kinds
of
untoward
consequences
for
future
administrative
law
cases
bearing
no
resemblance
at
all
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
government
submits
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
