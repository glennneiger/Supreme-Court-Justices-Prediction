unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
the
secretary
probably
thought
he
was
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
act
is
to
take
its
plan
on
elevation?
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
landowners
--
they
are
accessible
as
everyone
would
like
to
--
they'd
like
to
infer
to
landowners
to
take
the
rent
out
of
the
--
out
of
tax.
unknown
speaker
i
was
looking
for
some
reason
for
the
secretary
expanding
in
right
of
the
terms.
you
say
it
was
the
tenant
farmer,
how
did
he
do
it?
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
farmer's
rights?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
it
that
this
particular
part
of
the
regulation
just
affects
people
who
are
renting
land,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
no
one
is
permitted
to
assign
these
payments
for
the
purpose
of
securing
the
purchase
price
land.
unknown
speaker
so
why
would
he
--
what
reason
would
he
have
for
including
cash
rent
in
the
assignment?
unknown
speaker
do
you
defend
--
are
you
defending
the
decision
below
on
standing?
unknown
speaker
on
the
grounds
used
by
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there
is
no
statutory
indication
of
any
desire
of
intention
to
protect
tenants
as
well?
unknown
speaker
what
section
do
you
think
the
assignment
regulation
was
issued
under
--
unknown
speaker
well
(d)
13
just
says
what?
this
says
that
the
provision
from
a
certain
section
fell
apart?
unknown
speaker
and
the
secretary
however
has
issued
a
regulation
which
interprets
that
section
or
which
applies
it
in
a
way
that
it
hasn't
been
applied
before.
unknown
speaker
well
let
me
ask
you
--
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you,
there's
a
--
what
does
the
statute
--
what
is
the
statute
--
why
is
the
statute
has
to
permitting
exemptions
from
the
normal
and
assignment
policy?
unknown
speaker
that
too
i
suppose
is
the
purpose
of
that
section
is
to
aid
in
farmers
getting
financing
in
their
operations.
unknown
speaker
well
now,
why
would
you
suggest
then
that
these
farmers
involved
in
this
case
aren't
within
the
group
which
this
section
was
intended
to
benefit?
unknown
speaker
well
being
in
that
group
they
come
in
and
say
that
this
section
was
intended
to
benefit
the
farmers.
this
section
which
(d)
13
applies
to
this
statutory
scheme
and
we
think
that
the
regulation
issued
under
that
--
unknown
speaker
failed
to
benefit
or
benefit
them
badly
or
frustrate
the
purpose
of
the
act,
now
why
doesn't
that
satisfy
hardin?
unknown
speaker
of
course
this
isn't
a
competition
case.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there
is
a
case
of
controversy
here?
unknown
speaker
the
policy
question
about
standing
then,
we
are
really
talking
about
the
hardin
type
of
question.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
assume
the
secretary
had
at
the
bar
had
left
the
regulations
just
like
they
were
before.
unknown
speaker
and
the
tenant
came
in
and
said
“gee!
mr.
secretary
i
just
can't
stay
on
my
land
because
the
landlord
wants
security
and
i
want
to
give
it
to
him
but
you
say
i
can't
have
it.
i
can
assign
it
now.
we
think
--
i
would
like
to
challenge
your
interpretation
of
this
section.”
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
how
about
standing?
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
go
--
you
would
both
ways
on
it
and
you
have
to.
unknown
speaker
or
they
might
have
been
more
understanding
--
i
recognize
--
unknown
speaker
the
relationship
between
the
two
obviously
of
your
understanding
as
to
their
relationships.
unknown
speaker
well,
did
the
lower
court
decide
anything
more
than
the
standing
case?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
certainly
judge
turtle's
consent,
for
example
was
solely
understanding
the
question?
unknown
speaker
abbot
laboratories
was
not
on
standing.
unknown
speaker
their
answer
is
not
standing.
their
right
was
not
standing.
unknown
speaker
to
my
understanding
of
the
merits
of
course
are
always
declined.
unknown
speaker
have
both
questions
been
argued
by
both
parties?
unknown
speaker
yes,
well
there
is
no
jurisdiction
with
that.
unknown
speaker
why
should
we
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
i
would
prefer
if
you
would
say
something
about
the
merits
if
you
want
to
argue.
unknown
speaker
once
you
carry
that
it's
the
logical
conclusion,
what
you
do
is
wipe
out
standing
as
a
fact
of
it
all.
you
might
as
well
reach
the
merits
on
all
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course
that's
a
very
easy
case,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
does
that
require
any
evidence?
the
determination
of
that
point?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it?
is
it
purely
a
question
of
statutory
construction?
unknown
speaker
how
long
has
this
case
already
been
pending?
unknown
speaker
two-and-a-half
years?
unknown
speaker
three-and-a-half
years.
unknown
speaker
how
long
would
it
probably
take
if
it
went
back
to
find
it's
way
back
to
you?
unknown
speaker
that
was
truly
a
legal
decision
including
the
words,
the
language
of
the
act?
unknown
speaker
but
you
advise
no
evidence?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
we
weren't
committed
to
authority
of
writ
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
you
have
taken
him
off
for
non-payment?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
the
secretary
probably
thought
he
was
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
one
of
the
purposes
of

is
to

unknown

so
why
would
he

what

would
he
have
for
including
cash
rent
in
the
assignment?
unknown

do
you
defend
