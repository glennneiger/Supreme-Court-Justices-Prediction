mr.
harold
edgar
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
very
limited
purposes
for
which
assignments
may
be
made
of
benefits
payable
under
the
upland
cotton
program.
more
particularly,
it
concerns
whether
the
secretary
of
agriculture
may
disregard
the
considerable
legislative
and
administrative
construction
of
the
statutory
phrase
“making
a
crop”
and
redefine
it
to
authorize
assignments
for
the
purpose
of
paying
rent
for
land.
prior
to
his
change
from
regulations
such
assignments
were
prohibited.
petitioners,
tenant
farmers
who
were
hurt
by
this
change
and
regulation
in
a
manner
i
shall
develop
brought
suit
in
the
middle
of
the
district
of
alabama
seeking
a
declaration
that
the
change
in
regulation
was
invalid.
the
district
judge
held
that
they
have
no
standing
to
raise
the
claim
and
that
in
any
event
it
was
not
meritorious.
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
on
grounds
of
standing
alone,
this
court
granted
certiorari
last
june.
i'd
like
to
begin
by
showing
how
the
changed
regulation
harms
petitioners,
tenant
farmers.
they
farm
the
land
in
the
traditional
pattern
of
the
southern
cotton
farming.
they
stay
on
the
same
year
here
at
the
same
land
year
in
and
year
out,
some
have
been
into
farm
all
their
lives.
some
61
years,
the
shortest
named
petitioner
has
been
there
for
over
ten
years.
what
they
do
is
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
they
file
--
they
make
a
rent
note
with
the
landowner
and
that
rent
note
gives
them
the
right
to
use
the
land.
it
also
normally
provides
for
the
landowner
paying
them
small
advances
to
pay
for
food
and
clothing
while
the
crop
is
being
grown.
and
the
landlord
for
this
gets
both
the
right
for
the
rent
at
the
settlement
date
which
is
after
the
crop
is
in
and
at
that
time
the
advances
are
repayable
with
interest.
however
since
the
tenant
farmers
do
not
have
any
credit
standing
in
the
community,
typically
they
are
forced
to
buy
all
of
the
seed
and
tools
that
they
need
to
make
their
crop
from
the
landowner
who
extends
them
credit
and
charges
prices
more
higher
than
the
prices
that
are
charged
in
the
community
at
large.
moreover,
interest
is
payable
in
that
amount.
so
it
turns
out
that
at
the
end
of
the
year
they
have
to
pay
their
rent
for
all
their
purchases
in
the
interim
and
typically
they
have
nothing
left
and
this
goes
on
year
in
year
out.
now
the
upland
cotton
program
promised
a
somewhat
better
deal
for
petitioners
in
this
position.
what
it
did
is
it
authorized
in
section
(d)
13
that
payments
made
under
the
program
could
be
assigned.
now
the
assignment
is
a
right
to
get
credit.
i
mean
if
you
can
assign
and
get
credit,
people
know
in
the
community
that
you
have
a
definite
amount
of
federal
funds
coming
in,
you
can
avoid
the
necessity
of
buying
all
your
goods
at
the
stores
maintained
by
landowners
and
you
can
thereby
perhaps
save
some
of
the
money,
so
that
at
the
end
of
the
crop
season
you
will
have
some
money
left.
mr.
harold
edgar
it
is
not
known
exactly
in
advance
what
the
figure
will
be.
it
depends
on
the
amount
of
cotton
that's
grown
and
the
amount
of
land
that's
diverted.
the
land
diverted
is
a
fixed
payment
and
it
doesn't
--
you're
not
growing
any
crop
on
the
land
diverted
therefore
that
amount
will
be
fixed.
the
actual
price
support
is
predictable
by
knowing
the
typical
yield
rate
in
the
area
but
it's
not
by
any
matter
of
means
a
definite
figure.
mr.
harold
edgar
no,
your
honor.
now,
if
they
also
your
honor
what
they
can
do
is
that
they
can
start
cooperatives
as
they
have
done
in
this
case.
tenant
farmers
can
get
together
and
by
pulling
their
credit
resources
they
can
buy
and
they
can
purchase
at
far
less
than
the
cost
which
they
are
now
paying.
now
if
the
landlord,
if
they
can
assign
these
payments
to
the
landowner
for
whom
they
rent,
they
in
effect
lose
the
right
--
the
credit
the
congress
intended
for
them.
the
landlord
simply
insists
that
the
assignment
be
made
as
additional
security
for
renting
the
land.
in
that
case
he
cannot
use
any
of
the
credit
that
congress
has
provided
for
his
benefit
and
so
far
as
he
is
concerned,
congress
might
as
well
not
have
passed
section
(d)
13
which
did
grant
farmers
this
right
of
assignment
with
a
purpose
of
creating
credit
for
small
farmers.
now,
the
government
doesn't
deny
that
this
is
going
on.
what
happened
in
this
case
was
that
the
landowner
told
petitioners
that
either
they
made
an
assignment
or
they
got
of
the
land
and
that
two
or
three
of
them
refused
to
make
the
assignment,
they
were
thrown
off
the
land,
they
were
deprived
of
their
allotments
which
are
tied
to
the
land
and
they
were
left
without
effectively
any
source
of
income.
the
others
made
the
assignment
but
then
they
were
deprived
of
the
credit
as
i
say
which
congress
provided.
now
the
government
--
respondent
does
not
challenge
that
this
is
in
fact
what
happens.
it
just
says
that
it's
not
--
the
fact
that
it's
happened
does
not
suffice
to
warrant
granting
relief.
the
question
then
is
whether
congress
permitted
this
result.
a
relevant
statutory
language
is
found
in
section
8
(g)
of
the
soil
conversation
and
domestic
allotment
act
which
provides
for
assignments
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
crop.
there
are
three
considerations
we
think
that
preclude
interpretation
of
this
language
to
encompass
assignment
for
the
purpose
of
paying
rent
for
land.
first,
the
structure
of
the
statute
itself;
second,
its
legislative
history
demonstrating
a
congressional
intent
to
use
the
phrase
as
a
limitation
on
assignment
rights;
and
finally
administrative
construction
given
the
term
which
from
the
moment
of
enactment
in
1937
has
precluded
until
the
change
regulation
here
challenged
any
assignments
for
the
purpose
of
paying
rent.
first,
the
structure
of
the
statute,
it
provides
for
assignments
to
secure
cash
and
advances
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
crop.
now
only
in
the
theoretical
economist's
view
is
securing
use
of
land
in
advance.
normally
advances
mean
goods
that
are
supplied
to
you
on
credit,
so
the
language
of
the
statute
does
not
seem
to
be
looking
to
assignments
for
the
purpose
of
paying
land
rent.
secondly
the
legislative
history,
we
suggest
of
the
soil
conversation
and
domestic
allotment
act
confirms
that
approach.
the
act
was
passed
as
a
compromise
provision
as
an
amendment
report
by
a
conference
committee.
the
house
bill
permitted
assignments
for
all
purposes
but
only
to
landowners.
the
bill
was
twice
introduced
in
the
senate,
a
broader
assignment
bill
permitting
assignments
to
anyone
and
the
senate
refused
to
pass
it
because
it
provided
insufficient
protection
for
tenant
farmers
from
being
forced
or
from
being
--
either
by
their
economic
circumstances
or
their
own
lack
of
prudence
from
making
inadvisable
assignments.
so
the
senate
rejected
the
bill
twice.
in
conference
committee
the
bill
came
forth
but
it
came
forth
limited
by
these
provisions
that
are
designed
to
protect.
one
of
those
protections
is
the
limitation
of
the
purpose
of
assignments
to
making
a
crop
and
making
a
crop
is
not
a
term
of
common
usage.
it's
also
a
technical
agricultural
term
and
we
believe—
mr.
harold
edgar
well,
your
honor
i
have
planned
to
deal
with
the
standing
question
at
the
end
of
my
argument
but
let
me
--
mr.
harold
edgar
well
the
lower
court
also
intimated
its
views
on
the
merit
but
yes
its
specific
holding
was
that
there
was
--
mr.
harold
edgar
no
your
honor,
not
expressly.
i
will
turn
then
to
the
standing
question.
mr.
harold
edgar
well,
your
honor
we
believe
that
a
decision
on
the
entire
case
is
appropriate
in
this
court.
the
standing
question
and
the
question
on
the
merits
are
very
closely
linked.
mr.
harold
edgar
the
only
--
yes,
your
honor
the
only
--
mr.
harold
edgar
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
--
mr.
harold
edgar
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
strongly
indicated
its
view
on
the
merits
as
respondent
noted
and
in
our
view
that
the
questions
are
so
close
that
it
doesn't
want
remanding
for
the
purpose
of
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
mr.
harold
edgar
yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
fifth
circuit
decision
was
simply
--
was
erroneous
in
denying
standing
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
the
source
of
confusion
there
was
that
they
analogized
this
case
to
the
case
of
the
competitive
interloper.
most
of
the
cases
that
have
raised
severe
standing
problems
in
this
court
are
those
who
are
persons
who
is
not
--
whose
conduct
is
in
no
way
described
by
a
statute
challenges
the
action
of
someone
else
who
is
under
some
form
of
statutory
limitation
and
urges
that
the
statutory
limitations
that
govern
the
other
persons
conduct
are
not
being
carried
out.
this
is
not
such
a
case
at
all,
for
example
if
the
secretary
of
agriculture
had
instead
of
expanding
the
purposes
for
which
assignments
might
have
been
made,
might
be
made.
if
he
had
simply
said
no
assignments
shall
be
made
at
all,
it
seems
that
the
petitioners
are
surely
entitled
to
come
to
court
and
challenge
his
construction
of
his
duties
under
the
statute
and
simply
saying
that
it
will
not
be
--
the
statute
will
not
be
given
effect
and
there's
no
--
from
the
point
of
view
of
standing,
doesn't
seem
to
us
that
there's
any
difference
if
he
is
cutting
back
power
to
assign
or
expanding
where
it
is
clear
that
the
purposes
that
the
congressional
reasons
which
underlay
the
imposition
of
the
restrictions
on
standing
were
precisely
to
benefit
tenant
farmers.
in
the
same
way
that
settler
of
a
spendthrift
trust
imposes
the
limits
on
his
spendthrift
trust
to
protect
the
beneficiary
against
his
unwise
judgment.
surely
for
example,
just
as
a
matter
of
common
law,
the
analogue,
the
common
law,
an
interest
protected
at
common
law
the
strictest
standard
that
this
court
has
ever
used
in
standing
cases.
any
trustee
who
informed
the
beneficiary
of
spendthrift
trust
that
he
was
simply
going
to
disregard
the
terms
of
the
trust
the
beneficiary
would
have
standing
to
seek
removal
of
the
trust
and
we
suggest
that
even
under
the
common
law
right
analogue
that
this
case
--
there
is
standing
in
this
case.
there
is
also
clearly
standing
under
this
court's
holding
in
hardin.
the
hardin
case
two
terms
ago,
there
the
court
said
that
there
was
standing.
standing
did
exist
when
a
person
was
a
member
of
a
class
whose
interest
congress
had
sought
to
protect.
now
as
we
say
the
legislative
history
of
section
8
(g)
is
clear.
it
emerges
as
an
assignment
--
broad
assignment
provision,
the
senate
rejects
it
precisely
because
it
is
too
broad
and
it
manages
to
get
approved
with
narrow
limitations
on
the
purposes
for
which
assignments
may
be
made.
that
is
the
only
grounds
upon
which
the
approval,
the
congressional
approval
was
granted.
so
we
think
in
light
of
that
it's
clear
that
these
tenant
farmers
are
within
the
class
that
congress
had
intended
to
protect.
furthermore,
that
is
that
conclusion
is
particularly
strong,
seems
particularly
mandated,
in
so
far
as
this
court
has
often
said
that
there
ought
to
be
a
presumption
that
administrative
action
is
judicially
reviewable.
now
no
one
else
can
have
standing
in
this
case
but
petitioners.
in
other
words
a
landowner
who
is
harmed,
who
thought
himself
harmed
would
have
no
standing
to
raise
the
claim
pressed
here
in.
these
plaintiffs
are
the
only
ones
who
do
and
it's
proper
in
light
of
the
presumption
in
favor
of
judicial
review
that
standing
be
conferred
on
those
who
are
adversely
affected
in
fact
and
that
is,
of
course
the
constitutional
minimum
but
there
is
no
question
here
that
these
parties
or
these
petitioners
are
adversely
affected
in
the
fact.
they’ve
been
--
some
of
them
have
been
thrown
off
the
land,
they've
been
working
all
their
lives
and
that
we
think
compels
the
conclusion
that
standing
is
present.
mr.
harold
edgar
no,
your
honor.
i've
read
the
government's
brief
but
i
was
not
here
yesterday.
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
return
to
the
question
of
making
a
crop
and
what
it
may
permissibly
mean.
as
the
term
is
not
one
of
the
broad
general
usage
it
is
not
as
the
government
--
respondent
suggests
a
synonym
for
current
farming
cause.
it
had
a
long
meaning
confirmed
by
agricultural
dictionaries
that
it
refers
to
producing
crops,
it
refers
to
harvesting,
to
sowing
a
seed.
it
does
not
refer
to
the
rental
of
land.
now
this
interpretation
we
think
is
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
within
nine
days
after
the
act
was
passed
the
secretary
of
agriculture
issued
regulations
expressly
forbidding
any
assignments
for
the
purpose
of
paying
rent
for
land.
this
was
immediately
after
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
now
he
was
undoubtedly
informed
as
to
what
congress’
purpose
had
been,
he
saw
the
potential
risk
in
permitting
land
owners
to
simply
you
surf
the
credit
that
would
have
been
provided
for
tenant
farmers
by
forcing
them
to
assign
and
he
said
it
could
not
be
done.
now
the
same
risk
is
present
today
and
as
we
say
respondent
does
not
challenge
the
fact
that
the
effect
of
permitting
assignments
to
pay
rent
is
to
take
the
credit
the
congress
provided
away
from
the
tenant
farmer.
now
the
question
becomes
what
effect
this
has
under
the
new
act,
section
(d)
13
which
as
we
say
is
the
provision
enacted
in
1965
which
incorporates
by
reference
the
prior
law.
now
that
new
act
is
also
pervaded
with
--
has
several
protections
for
small
farmers
in
it.
section
(d)
10
of
the
act
expressly
authorizes
and
commands
the
secretary
to
issue
regulations
to
protect
the
interest
of
small
tenant
farmers
and
sharecroppers.
so,
it
can't
be
said
that
this
purpose
which
underlay
the
1937
act
has
somehow
that
congress
is
of
the
view
that
it's
no
longer
important.
it
is
important.
mr.
harold
edgar
yes,
your
honor,
well
it
--
mr.
harold
edgar
it's
section
7
u.s.c.
144
d
(10)
your
honor
which
is
section
103
(d)
10
of
the
1949
agricultural
act.
mr.
harold
edgar
mr.
justice
white,
we
don't
think
that
construction
of
what
is
happened
is
a
likely
one.
the
reason
is
--
mr.
harold
edgar
i
think
he
was
just
--
mr.
harold
edgar
i
--
we
would
not
accept
that
your
honor
for
this
reason.
first
of
all,
for
most
farmers,
it
does
not
--
mr.
harold
edgar
no,
this
regulation
your
honor
is
not
issued
pursuant
--
the
regulations
we
are
challenging
are
not
issued
pursuant
to
section
(d)
10.
this
are
not
part
of
those
regulations,
they
are
rather
regulations
that
are
issued
under
section
(d)
13.
what
the
secretary
has
done
in
our
view
is
he
has
issued
regulations
in
part
protective
of
tenant
farmers
under
(d)
10.
he
has
redefined
the
term
“making
a
crop”
in
a
way
which
prejudices
severely
tenant
farmers
for
the
benefit
of
landowners
and
does
very
little
good
for
the
rest
of
the
farming
population.
now
the
people
who
simply
own
land
obviously
do
not
have
to
assign
for
the
purpose
of
paying
rent.
the
average
rental
value
of
cotton
land
is
between
one-third,
at
least
in
alabama
between
one-third
and
one-half
the
value
of
the
crop.
so,
even
those
farmers
who
do
rent
land
are
in
no
need
of
the
right
to
assign
for
the
purpose
of
paying
rent.
what
they
can
do
is
they
can
use
the
assignment
to
purchase
the
seeds,
the
tools,
the
other
things
that
they
need
which
are
as
large,
in
fact
larger
portion
of
the
ultimate
crop
value
and
use
whatever
resources
they
are
now
expending
to
get
those
goods
for
the
purpose
of
paying
their
rent
if
they
are
dealing
with
a
landowner
who
will
not
--
who
will
simply
refuse
to
accept
a
rent
except
on
a
pay
now
basis.
now
if
that
were
--
if
the
secretary’s
purpose
were
to
merely
to
help
other
farmers,
he
could
have
prevented
the
harm
that
is
done
here
simply
by
issuing
a
regulation
under
section
(d)
10
which
would
say
that
even
though
assignments
can
be
made
for
purpose
of
making
cash
rent,
no
landowner
can
kick
a
tenant
--
can
remove
a
tenant
from
the
farm
who
refuses
to
make
the
assignment.
now
if
the
only
purpose
which
underlay
to
change
definition
of
making
a
crop
was
to
facilitate
financing
for
farmers
as
a
whole,
this
particular
lawsuit
could
have
been
avoided
by
a
protective
regulation
issue
pursuant
to
section
(d)
10.
mr.
harold
edgar
your
honor,
we
do
not
know
what
are
the
reasons
underlying
the
secretary's
change
of
regulation
were
--
were
simply
they're
not
issued
after
any
formal
proceeding
and
they
are
not
issued
with
any
explanation.
in
part
it
may
be
that
landowners
have
been
hurt
somewhat
by
the
new
act
to
the
extent
that
the
land
--
to
the
extent
that
the
tenant
farmers
can
avoid
the
whole
structure
of
rent
notes,
advances,
credit
from
the
landowner's
farm.
they
are
going
to
be
losing
income
and
we
simply
do
not
know
whether
that
was
a
motivating
factor
behind
the
secretary’s
action
whether
it
was
his
view.
a
view
which
we
don't
think
can
be
supported
that
it
was
necessary.
mr.
harold
edgar
yes,
it
was.
mr.
harold
edgar
they
would
like.
at
the
moment,
they
are
not
encouraging
that
because
the
cotton
years
have
been
very
bad
for
the
last
three
years,
so
they
are
no
longer
insisting
upon
diversion
for
the
1969
crop.
presumably
they
will
again
but
that
is
not
--
that
does
not
affect
the
question
of
assignments.
we
don't
believe
your
honor
the
whether
or
not
they
are
encouraging
people
to
take
land
out
of
reduction
is
not
out
of
cotton
production.
it
does
not
affect
the
question
of
whether
assignments
ought
to
be
made,
ought
to
be
authorized
for
the
purpose
of
hanging
around.
mr.
harold
edgar
the
only
--
we
think
there
are
two
possible
--
mr.
harold
edgar
it
is
we
think
possible
that
he
did
it
to
facilitate
financing
for
farmers
across
the
board
you
know
all
farmers.
it
makes
it
easier
i
suppose
for
all
farmers
to
finance
their
total
farming
expenditures.
it
makes
it
easy
in
a
limited
sense
rather
than
juggling
their
use
of
credit
--
mr.
harold
edgar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
edgar
no
your
honor,
it
would
only
facilitate
those
--
mr.
harold
edgar
we
can
suppose
only
two,
one
is
that
he
was
attempting
to
facilitate
financing
for
farmers
who
both
own
land
and
rent
land.
it
makes
somewhat
easier
for
them
if
they
can
assign
their
payments
to
secure
cash
to
pay
the
rent.
this
is
not
in
the
tenant
farm
con
--
no,
not
in
the
tenant
farm
context.
now
the
reason
we
don't
think
that
was
his
motivation
is
that
if
that's
all
he
wanted
to
do,
he
could
have
protected
against
this
particular
abuse
of
which
he
was
aware.
i
mean
from
alabama
tenant
farmers
organize
presented
their
claim.
now
he
could
have
protected
this
abuse
simply
by
issuing
a
regulation
precluding
a
landowner
from
removing
a
tenant
from
his
farm
if
the
tenant
refused
to
make
the
assignment.
if
the
only
purpose
behind
the
secretary's
action
was
a
facilitated
one
then
the
harm
here
alleged
which
is
a
real
harm
could
have
been
--
could
have
been
taken
away,
could
have
been
removed
very
simply.
so
it's
for
that
reason
that
we
do
not
think
that
this
was
the
underlying
the
secretary's
action.
particularly
in
so
far
as
even
those
farmers
who
rent
land,
who
both
own
land
and
rent
land,
can
normally
juggle
their
use
of
the
assignment
to
pay
for
their
crops
with
their
cash.
i
mean
pay
for
their
land
with
cash
and
their
seed,
livestock,
tools
and
those
matters
with
their
assignment
money.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
--
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
for
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
harold
edgar
your
honor
i'd
like
to
first
speak
a
bit
about
whether
a
remand
would
be
appropriate
in
this
case
under
both
the
governments’
discussion
of
standing
and
on
our
discussion
of
standing.
the
plaintiff
--
the
purpose
of
the
assignment
provision
is
put
very
much
in
question
in
order
to
decide
whether
standing
exists.
in
view
of
the
necessity
of
elucidating
the
purposes
underlying
the
law
that
there
is
very
closely
on
the
scope
of
the
discretion
that
the
secretary
has
in
changing
interpretations
of
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
language
that
are
well
settled,
that
have
been
well
settled.
and
in
view
of
that
fact,
it
would
seem
to
us
that
in
to
remand
the
question
once
that
task
had
been
done
in
this
court
to
remand
that
question
to
the
courts
below
would
be
inappropriate.
mr.
harold
edgar
no
your
honor,
i
don't
think
--
may
i
give
an
example?
for
example
suppose
a
landowner
sued
under
section
8
(g)
regardless
of
whether
that
deals
with
tenants
with
all
farmers,
it
doesn't
deal
with
the
interest
of
landowners.
standing
would
be
very
appropriate
means
of
disposing
of
that
case.
the
land
owners
simply
lack
standing
to
come
in
and
sue
under
this
particular
act
and
it
involves
no
--
it
involves
the
consideration
of
the
purposes
underlying
the
act
of
course
but
it
does
not
require
you
to
reach
the
scope
of
discretion
that
the
secretary
has
to
define
the
terms
of
the
language
at
all.
mr.
harold
edgar
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
harold
edgar
well
these
are
petitioners
your
honor,
our
cash
tenants.
mr.
harold
edgar
the
tenant
farmers
here
your
honor
are
those
who
pay
rent
in
cash.
the
secretary
has
not
although
taking
the
new
view
that
land
--
payments
for
land
are
part
of
making
a
crop
does
not
permit
such
assignments
to
be
made
by
share
properties.
mr.
harold
edgar
no,
we
have
the
cash
tenants.
mr.
harold
edgar
they
are
not
--
they
have
not
been
harmed
by
the
change
in
the
definition
although
the
inconsistency
of
the
secretary's
approach
is
made
manifest
by
the
fact
that
he
alters
it
for
purposes
of
paying
cash
rent
yet
not
--
mr.
harold
edgar
mere
error
is
not
--
does
not
give
you
standing,
no
your
honor.
mr.
harold
edgar
well,
the
point
--
my
point
is
your
honor
that
the
merits,
the
question
on
the
merits
is
very
closely
interrelated
to
the
purposes
of
the
act
to
the
extent
that
the
act
does
have
a
purpose
to
protect
to
that
extent
that
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
statutory
language
which
removes
protection
is
less
permissible.
it's
impermissible
as
the
plainness
of
the
congressional
intent
becomes
what
is
found.
mr.
harold
edgar
the
question
on
the
merits
is
whether
the
term
making
a
crop,
the
term
that
has
agricultural
long
legislative
history
but
it
does
not
mean
paying
rent
for
land
whether
the
secretary
can
redefine
it
in
order
to
permit
tenant
farmers
to
pay.
mr.
harold
edgar
no.
no,
your
honor
it
does
not.
mr.
harold
edgar
purely
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
mr.
harold
edgar
approximately
three-and-a-half
years
your
honor.
mr.
harold
edgar
three.
mr.
harold
edgar
i
may
be
mistaken,
i
believe
it's
three.
it
was
66
it
was
brought
--
mr.
harold
edgar
your
honor
it
would
probably
go
back
to
the
fifth
circuit
which
has
already
intimated
its
views.
i
don't
know
what
the
timing
is,
i
would
think
of
another
year
at
least
before
the
fifth
circuit
would
rule
on
the
remand
and
the
case
might
be
heard
again
in
this
court
but
i'm
not
aware
of
the
docket
so
that
will
be
fifth
circuit.
mr.
harold
edgar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
edgar
yes,
your
honor.
sorry
sir.
now
on
this
point
we
are
aware
that
the
secretary
has
issued
regulations
under
section
(d)
10.
the
point
is
however
that
the
secretary
as
the
government
made
clear
in
its
opposition
has
construed
this
regulations
not
to
bar
a
landowner
from
removing
a
tenant
from
the
land
when
he
does
not
assign
his
credit
over.
that
is
the
precise
point
at
issue
respondents
brief
in
opposition
says
that
the
secretary
of
agriculture
informs
the
government
that
that
is
the
way
those
regulations
have
been
construed
that
this
harm
can
continue.
now
the
problem
of
protecting
tenant
farmers
--
mr.
harold
edgar
no,
your
honor
he
cannot,
this
is
the
point
which
i
wish
to
develop.
there
is
a
network
of
federal
regulations
precluding
land
owners
from
terminating
the
tenancy
of
their
tenants.
under
the
d10
regulations,
he
is
not
permitted
to
simply
go
to
his
tenant
and
say
“i'm
sorry,
if
you
can't
pay
your
money
i
don't
want
to
rent
you
anymore,
i'm
raising
the
rent”
he
cannot
raise
the
rent,
he
cannot
alter
the
terms
of
the—well
there
are
limitations
on
his
ability
to
alter
the
terms
of
the
statutes.
mr.
harold
edgar
if
he
can.
if
he
does
not
pay
at
settlement
date
he
can
take
them
off
but
only
on
that
day
and
there
is
this
long
pattern
of
protecting
federal
benefits
against
user
payment
by
landowners
and
this
credit
right
is
right
to
assign
is
another
form
of
federal
benefit.
it
is
being
--
the
secretary
is
permitting
its
use
of
pay
by
it's
--
by
it's
--
by
his
impermissible
redefinition
of
the
term
making
a
crop.
thank
you.
mr.
harold
edgar
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
very
limited
purposes
for
which
assignments
may
be
made
of
benefits
payable
under
the
upland
cotton
program.
more
particularly,
it
concerns
whether
the
secretary
of
agriculture
may
disregard
the
considerable
legislative
and
administrative
construction
of
the
statutory
phrase
“making
a
crop”
and
redefine
it
to
authorize
assignments
for
the
purpose
of
paying
rent
for
land.
prior
to
his
change
from
regulations
such
assignments
were
prohibited.
petitioners,
tenant
farmers
who
were
hurt
by
this
change
and
regulation
in
a
manner
i
shall
develop
brought
suit
in
the
middle
of
the
district
of
alabama
seeking
a
declaration
that
the
change
in
regulation
was
invalid.
the
district
judge
held
that
they
have
no
standing
to
raise
the
claim
and
that
in
any
event
it
was
not
meritorious.
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
on
grounds
of
standing
alone,
this
court
granted
certiorari
last
june.
i'd
like
to
begin
by
showing
how
the
changed
regulation
harms
petitioners,
tenant
farmers.
they
farm
the
land
in
the
traditional
pattern
of
the
southern
cotton
farming.
they
stay
on
the
same
year
here
at
the
same
land
year
in
and
year
out,
some
have
been
into
farm
all
their
lives.
some
61
years,
the
shortest
named
petitioner
has
been
there
for
over
ten
years.
what
they
do
is
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
they
file
--
they
make
a
rent
note
with
the
landowner
and
that
rent
note
gives
them
the
right
to
use
the
land.
it
also
normally
provides
for
the
landowner
paying
them
small
advances
to
pay
for
food
and
clothing
while
the
crop
is
being
grown.
and
the
landlord
for
this
gets
both
the
right
for
the
rent
at
the
settlement
date
which
is
after
the
crop
is
in
and
at
that
time
the
advances
are
repayable
with
interest.
however
since
the
tenant
farmers
do
not
have
any
credit
standing
in
the
community,
typically
they
are
forced
to
buy
all
of
the
seed
and
tools
that
they
need
to
make
their
crop
from
the
landowner
who
extends
them
credit
and
charges
prices
more
higher
than
the
prices
that
are
charged
in
the
community
at
large.
moreover,
interest
is
payable
in
that
amount.
so
it
turns
out
that
at
the
end
of
the
year
they
have
to
pay
their
rent
for
all
their
purchases
in
the
interim
and
typically
they
have
nothing
left
and
this
goes
on
year
in
year
out.
now
the
upland
cotton
program
promised
a
somewhat
better
deal
for
petitioners
in
this
position.
what
it
did
is
it
authorized
in
section
(d)
13
that
payments
made
under
the
program
could
be
assigned.
now
the
assignment
is
a
right
to
get
credit.
i
mean
if
you
can
assign
and
get
credit,
people
know
in
the
community
that
you
have
a
definite
amount
of
federal
funds
coming
in,
you
can
avoid
the
necessity
of
buying
all
your
goods
at
the
stores
maintained
by
landowners
and
you
can
thereby
perhaps
save
some
of
the
money,
so
that
at
the
end
of
the
crop
season
you
will
have
some
money
left.
mr.
harold
edgar
it
is
not
known
exactly
in
advance
what
the
figure
will
be.
it
depends
on
the
amount
of
cotton
that's
grown
and
the
amount
of
land
that's
diverted.
the
land
diverted
is
a
fixed
payment
and
it
doesn't
--
you're
not
growing
any
crop
on
the
land
diverted
therefore
that
amount
will
be
fixed.
the
actual
price
support
is
predictable
by
knowing
the
typical
yield
rate
in
the
area
but
it's
not
by
any
matter
of
means
a
definite
figure.
mr.
harold
edgar
no,
your
honor.
now,
if
they
also
your
honor
what
they
can
do
is
that
they
can
start
cooperatives
as
they
have
done
in
this
case.
tenant
farmers
can
get
together
and
by
pulling
their
credit
resources
they
can
buy
and
they
can
purchase
at
far
less
than
the
cost
which
they
are
now
paying.
now
if
the
landlord,
if
they
can
assign
these
payments
to
the
landowner
for
whom
they
rent,
they
in
effect
lose
the
right
--
the
credit
the
congress
intended
for
them.
the
landlord
simply
insists
that
the
assignment
be
made
as
additional
security
for
renting
the
land.
in
that
case
he
cannot
use
any
of
the
credit
that
congress
has
provided
for
his
benefit
and
so
far
as
he
is
concerned,
congress
might
as
well
not
have
passed
section
(d)
13
which
did
grant
farmers
this
right
of
assignment
with
a
purpose
of
creating
credit
for
small
farmers.
now,
the
government
doesn't
deny
that
this
is
going
on.
what
happened
in
this
case
was
that
the
landowner
told
petitioners
that
either
they
made
an
assignment
or
they
got
of
the
land
and
that
two
or
three
of
them
refused
to
make
the
assignment,
they
were
thrown
off
the
land,
they
were
deprived
of
their
allotments
which
are
tied
to
the
land
and
they
were
left
without
effectively
any
source
of
income.
the
others
made
the
assignment
but
then
they
were
deprived
of
the
credit
as
i
say
which
congress
provided.
now
the
government
--
respondent
does
not
challenge
that
this
is
in
fact
what
happens.
it
just
says
that
it's
not
--
the
fact
that
it's
happened
does
not
suffice
to
warrant
granting
relief.
the
question
then
is
whether
congress
permitted
this
result.
a
relevant
statutory
language
is
found
in
section
8
(g)
of
the
soil
conversation
and
domestic
allotment
act
which
provides
for
assignments
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
crop.
there
are
three
considerations
we
think
that
preclude
interpretation
of
this
language
to
encompass
assignment
for
the
purpose
of
paying
rent
for
land.
first,
the
structure
of
the
statute
itself;
second,
its
legislative
history
demonstrating
a
congressional
intent
to
use
the
phrase
as
a
limitation
on
assignment
rights;
and
finally
administrative
construction
given
the
term
which
from
the
moment
of
enactment
in
1937
has
precluded
until
the
change
regulation
here
challenged
any
assignments
for
the
purpose
of
paying
rent.
first,
the
structure
of
the
statute,
it
provides
for
assignments
to
secure
cash
and
advances
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
crop.
now
only
in
the
theoretical
economist's
view
is
securing
use
of
land
in
advance.
normally
advances
mean
goods
that
are
supplied
to
you
on
credit,
so
the
language
of
the
statute
does
not
seem
to
be
looking
to
assignments
for
the
purpose
of
paying
land
rent.
secondly
the
legislative
history,
we
suggest
of
the
soil
conversation
and
domestic
allotment
act
confirms
that
approach.
the
act
was
passed
as
a
compromise
provision
as
an
amendment
report
by
a
conference
committee.
the
house
bill
permitted
assignments
for
all
purposes
but
only
to
landowners.
the
bill
was
twice
introduced
in
the
senate,
a
broader
assignment
bill
permitting
assignments
to
anyone
and
the
senate
refused
to
pass
it
because
it
provided
insufficient
protection
for
tenant
farmers
from
being
forced
or
from
being
--
either
by
their
economic
circumstances
or
their
own
lack
of
prudence
from
making
inadvisable
assignments.
so
the
senate
rejected
the
bill
twice.
in
conference
committee
the
bill
came
forth
but
it
came
forth
limited
by
these
provisions
that
are
designed
to
protect.
one
of
those
protections
is
the
limitation
of
the
purpose
of
assignments
to
making
a
crop
and
making
a
crop
is
not
a
term
of
common
usage.
it's
also
a
technical
agricultural
term
and
we
believe—
mr.
harold
edgar
well,
your
honor
i
have
planned
to
deal
with
the
standing
question
at
the
end
of
my
argument
but
let
me
--
mr.
harold
edgar
well
the
lower
court
also
intimated
its
views
on
the
merit
but
yes
its
specific
holding
was
that
there
was
--
mr.
harold
edgar
no
your
honor,
not
expressly.
i
will
turn
then
to
the
standing
question.
mr.
harold
edgar
well,
your
honor
we
believe
that
a
decision
on
the
entire
case
is
appropriate
in
this
court.
the
standing
question
and
the
question
on
the
merits
are
very
closely
linked.
mr.
harold
edgar
the
only
--
yes,
your
honor
the
only
--
mr.
harold
edgar
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
--
mr.
harold
edgar
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
strongly
indicated
its
view
on
the
merits
as
respondent
noted
and
in
our
view
that
the
questions
are
so
close
that
it
doesn't
want
remanding
for
the
purpose
of
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
mr.
harold
edgar
yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
fifth
circuit
decision
was
simply
--
was
erroneous
in
denying
standing
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
the
source
of
confusion
there
was
that
they
analogized
this
case
to
the
case
of
the
competitive
interloper.
most
of
the
cases
that
have
raised
severe
standing
problems
in
this
court
are
those
who
are
persons
who
is
not
--
whose
conduct
is
in
no
way
described
by
a
statute
challenges
the
action
of
someone
else
who
is
under
some
form
of
statutory
limitation
and
urges
that
the
statutory
limitations
that
govern
the
other
persons
conduct
are
not
being
carried
out.
this
is
not
such
a
case
at
all,
for
example
if
the
secretary
of
agriculture
had
instead
of
expanding
the
purposes
for
which
assignments
might
have
been
made,
might
be
made.
if
he
had
simply
said
no
assignments
shall
be
made
at
all,
it
seems
that
the
petitioners
are
surely
entitled
to
come
to
court
and
challenge
his
construction
of
his
duties
under
the
statute
and
simply
saying
that
it
will
not
be
--
the
statute
will
not
be
given
effect
and
there's
no
--
from
the
point
of
view
of
standing,
doesn't
seem
to
us
that
there's
any
difference
if
he
is
cutting
back
power
to
assign
or
expanding
where
it
is
clear
that
the
purposes
that
the
congressional
reasons
which
underlay
the
imposition
of
the
restrictions
on
standing
were
precisely
to
benefit
tenant
farmers.
in
the
same
way
that
settler
of
a
spendthrift
trust
imposes
the
limits
on
his
spendthrift
trust
to
protect
the
beneficiary
against
his
unwise
judgment.
surely
for
example,
just
as
a
matter
of
common
law,
the
analogue,
the
common
law,
an
interest
protected
at
common
law
the
strictest
standard
that
this
court
has
ever
used
in
standing
cases.
any
trustee
who
informed
the
beneficiary
of
spendthrift
trust
that
he
was
simply
going
to
disregard
the
terms
of
the
trust
the
beneficiary
would
have
standing
to
seek
removal
of
the
trust
and
we
suggest
that
even
under
the
common
law
right
analogue
that
this
case
--
there
is
standing
in
this
case.
there
is
also
clearly
standing
under
this
court's
holding
in
hardin.
the
hardin
case
two
terms
ago,
there
the
court
said
that
there
was
standing.
standing
did
exist
when
a
person
was
a
member
of
a
class
whose
interest
congress
had
sought
to
protect.
now
as
we
say
the
legislative
history
of
section
8
(g)
is
clear.
it
emerges
as
an
assignment
--
broad
assignment
provision,
the
senate
rejects
it
precisely
because
it
is
too
broad
and
it
manages
to
get
approved
with
narrow
limitations
on
the
purposes
for
which
assignments
may
be
made.
that
is
the
only
grounds
upon
which
the
approval,
the
congressional
approval
was
granted.
so
we
think
in
light
of
that
it's
clear
that
these
tenant
farmers
are
within
the
class
that
congress
had
intended
to
protect.
furthermore,
that
is
that
conclusion
is
particularly
strong,
seems
particularly
mandated,
in
so
far
as
this
court
has
often
said
that
there
ought
to
be
a
presumption
that
administrative
action
is
judicially
reviewable.
now
no
one
else
can
have
standing
in
this
case
but
petitioners.
in
other
words
a
landowner
who
is
harmed,
who
thought
himself
harmed
would
have
no
standing
to
raise
the
claim
pressed
here
in.
these
plaintiffs
are
the
only
ones
who
do
and
it's
proper
in
light
of
the
presumption
in
favor
of
judicial
review
that
standing
be
conferred
on
those
who
are
adversely
affected
in
fact
and
that
is,
of
course
the
constitutional
minimum
but
there
is
no
question
here
that
these
parties
or
these
petitioners
are
adversely
affected
in
the
fact.
they’ve
been
--
some
of
them
have
been
thrown
off
the
land,
they've
been
working
all
their
lives
and
that
we
think
compels
the
conclusion
that
standing
is
present.
mr.
harold
edgar
no,
your
honor.
i've
read
the
government's
brief
but
i
was
not
here
yesterday.
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
return
to
the
question
of
making
a
crop
and
what
it
may
permissibly
mean.
as
the
term
is
not
one
of
the
broad
general
usage
it
is
not
as
the
government
--
respondent
suggests
a
synonym
for
current
farming
cause.
it
had
a
long
meaning
confirmed
by
agricultural
dictionaries
that
it
refers
to
producing
crops,
it
refers
to
harvesting,
to
sowing
a
seed.
it
does
not
refer
to
the
rental
of
land.
now
this
interpretation
we
think
is
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
within
nine
days
after
the
act
was
passed
the
secretary
of
agriculture
issued
regulations
expressly
forbidding
any
assignments
for
the
purpose
of
paying
rent
for
land.
this
was
immediately
after
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
now
he
was
undoubtedly
informed
as
to
what
congress’
purpose
had
been,
he
saw
the
potential
risk
in
permitting
land
owners
to
simply
you
surf
the
credit
that
would
have
been
provided
for
tenant
farmers
by
forcing
them
to
assign
and
he
said
it
could
not
be
done.
now
the
same
risk
is
present
today
and
as
we
say
respondent
does
not
challenge
the
fact
that
the
effect
of
permitting
assignments
to
pay
rent
is
to
take
the
credit
the
congress
provided
away
from
the
tenant
farmer.
now
the
question
becomes
what
effect
this
has
under
the
new
act,
section
(d)
13
which
as
we
say
is
the
provision
enacted
in
1965
which
incorporates
by
reference
the
prior
law.
now
that
new
act
is
also
pervaded
with
--
has
several
protections
for
small
farmers
in
it.
section
(d)
10
of
the
act
expressly
authorizes
and
commands
the
secretary
to
issue
regulations
to
protect
the
interest
of
small
tenant
farmers
and
sharecroppers.
so,
it
can't
be
said
that
this
purpose
which
underlay
the
1937
act
has
somehow
that
congress
is
of
the
view
that
it's
no
longer
important.
it
is
important.
mr.
harold
edgar
yes,
your
honor,
well
it
--
mr.
harold
edgar
it's
section
7
u.s.c.
144
d
(10)
your
honor
which
is
section
103
(d)
10
of
the
1949
agricultural
act.
mr.
harold
edgar
mr.
justice
white,
we
don't
think
that
construction
of
what
is
happened
is
a
likely
one.
the
reason
is
--
mr.
harold
edgar
i
think
he
was
just
--
mr.
harold
edgar
i
--
we
would
not
accept
that
your
honor
for
this
reason.
first
of
all,
for
most
farmers,
it
does
not
--
mr.
harold
edgar
no,
this
regulation
your
honor
is
not
issued
pursuant
--
the
regulations
we
are
challenging
are
not
issued
pursuant
to
section
(d)
10.
this
are
not
part
of
those
regulations,
they
are
rather
regulations
that
are
issued
under
section
(d)
13.
what
the
secretary
has
done
in
our
view
is
he
has
issued
regulations
in
part
protective
of
tenant
farmers
under
(d)
10.
he
has
redefined
the
term
“making
a
crop”
in
a
way
which
prejudices
severely
tenant
farmers
for
the
benefit
of
landowners
and
does
very
little
good
for
the
rest
of
the
farming
population.
now
the
people
who
simply
own
land
obviously
do
not
have
to
assign
for
the
purpose
of
paying
rent.
the
average
rental
value
of
cotton
land
is
between
one-third,
at
least
in
alabama
between
one-third
and
one-half
the
value
of
the
crop.
so,
even
those
farmers
who
do
rent
land
are
in
no
need
of
the
right
to
assign
for
the
purpose
of
paying
rent.
what
they
can
do
is
they
can
use
the
assignment
to
purchase
the
seeds,
the
tools,
the
other
things
that
they
need
which
are
as
large,
in
fact
larger
portion
of
the
ultimate
crop
value
and
use
whatever
resources
they
are
now
expending
to
get
those
goods
for
the
purpose
of
paying
their
rent
if
they
are
dealing
with
a
landowner
who
will
not
--
who
will
simply
refuse
to
accept
a
rent
except
on
a
pay
now
basis.
now
if
that
were
--
if
the
secretary’s
purpose
were
to
merely
to
help
other
farmers,
he
could
have
prevented
the
harm
that
is
done
here
simply
by
issuing
a
regulation
under
section
(d)
10
which
would
say
that
even
though
assignments
can
be
made
for
purpose
of
making
cash
rent,
no
landowner
can
kick
a
tenant
--
can
remove
a
tenant
from
the
farm
who
refuses
to
make
the
assignment.
now
if
the
only
purpose
which
underlay
to
change
definition
of
making
a
crop
was
to
facilitate
financing
for
farmers
as
a
whole,
this
particular
lawsuit
could
have
been
avoided
by
a
protective
regulation
issue
pursuant
to
section
(d)
10.
mr.
harold
edgar
your
honor,
we
do
not
know
what
are
the
reasons
underlying
the
secretary's
change
of
regulation
were
--
were
simply
they're
not
issued
after
any
formal
proceeding
and
they
are
not
issued
with
any
explanation.
in
part
it
may
be
that
landowners
have
been
hurt
somewhat
by
the
new
act
to
the
extent
that
the
land
--
to
the
extent
that
the
tenant
farmers
can
avoid
the
whole
structure
of
rent
notes,
advances,
credit
from
the
landowner's
farm.
they
are
going
to
be
losing
income
and
we
simply
do
not
know
whether
that
was
a
motivating
factor
behind
the
secretary’s
action
whether
it
was
his
view.
a
view
which
we
don't
think
can
be
supported
that
it
was
necessary.
mr.
harold
edgar
yes,
it
was.
mr.
harold
edgar
they
would
like.
at
the
moment,
they
are
not
encouraging
that
because
the
cotton
years
have
been
very
bad
for
the
last
three
years,
so
they
are
no
longer
insisting
upon
diversion
for
the
1969
crop.
presumably
they
will
again
but
that
is
not
--
that
does
not
affect
the
question
of
assignments.
we
don't
believe
your
honor
the
whether
or
not
they
are
encouraging
people
to
take
land
out
of
reduction
is
not
out
of
cotton
production.
it
does
not
affect
the
question
of
whether
assignments
ought
to
be
made,
ought
to
be
authorized
for
the
purpose
of
hanging
around.
mr.
harold
edgar
the
only
--
we
think
there
are
two
possible
--
mr.
harold
edgar
it
is
we
think
possible
that
he
did
it
to
facilitate
financing
for
farmers
across
the
board
you
know
all
farmers.
it
makes
it
easier
i
suppose
for
all
farmers
to
finance
their
total
farming
expenditures.
it
makes
it
easy
in
a
limited
sense
rather
than
juggling
their
use
of
credit
--
mr.
harold
edgar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
edgar
no
your
honor,
it
would
only
facilitate
those
--
mr.
harold
edgar
we
can
suppose
only
two,
one
is
that
he
was
attempting
to
facilitate
financing
for
farmers
who
both
own
land
and
rent
land.
it
makes
somewhat
easier
for
them
if
they
can
assign
their
payments
to
secure
cash
to
pay
the
rent.
this
is
not
in
the
tenant
farm
con
--
no,
not
in
the
tenant
farm
context.
now
the
reason
we
don't
think
that
was
his
motivation
is
that
if
that's
all
he
wanted
to
do,
he
could
have
protected
against
this
particular
abuse
of
which
he
was
aware.
i
mean
from
alabama
tenant
farmers
organize
presented
their
claim.
now
he
could
have
protected
this
abuse
simply
by
issuing
a
regulation
precluding
a
landowner
from
removing
a
tenant
from
his
farm
if
the
tenant
refused
to
make
the
assignment.
if
the
only
purpose
behind
the
secretary's
action
was
a
facilitated
one
then
the
harm
here
alleged
which
is
a
real
harm
could
have
been
--
could
have
been
taken
away,
could
have
been
removed
very
simply.
so
it's
for
that
reason
that
we
do
not
think
that
this
was
the
underlying
the
secretary's
action.
particularly
in
so
far
as
even
those
farmers
who
rent
land,
who
both
own
land
and
rent
land,
can
normally
juggle
their
use
of
the
assignment
to
pay
for
their
crops
with
their
cash.
i
mean
pay
for
their
land
with
cash
and
their
seed,
livestock,
tools
and
those
matters
with
their
assignment
money.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
--
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
for
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
harold
edgar
your
honor
i'd
like
to
first
speak
a
bit
about
whether
a
remand
would
be
appropriate
in
this
case
under
both
the
governments’
discussion
of
standing
and
on
our
discussion
of
standing.
the
plaintiff
--
the
purpose
of
the
assignment
provision
is
put
very
much
in
question
in
order
to
decide
whether
standing
exists.
in
view
of
the
necessity
of
elucidating
the
purposes
underlying
the
law
that
there
is
very
closely
on
the
scope
of
the
discretion
that
the
secretary
has
in
changing
interpretations
of
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
language
that
are
well
settled,
that
have
been
well
settled.
and
in
view
of
that
fact,
it
would
seem
to
us
that
in
to
remand
the
question
once
that
task
had
been
done
in
this
court
to
remand
that
question
to
the
courts
below
would
be
inappropriate.
mr.
harold
edgar
no
your
honor,
i
don't
think
--
may
i
give
an
example?
for
example
suppose
a
landowner
sued
under
section
8
(g)
regardless
of
whether
that
deals
with
tenants
with
all
farmers,
it
doesn't
deal
with
the
interest
of
landowners.
standing
would
be
very
appropriate
means
of
disposing
of
that
case.
the
land
owners
simply
lack
standing
to
come
in
and
sue
under
this
particular
act
and
it
involves
no
--
it
involves
the
consideration
of
the
purposes
underlying
the
act
of
course
but
it
does
not
require
you
to
reach
the
scope
of
discretion
that
the
secretary
has
to
define
the
terms
of
the
language
at
all.
mr.
harold
edgar
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
harold
edgar
well
these
are
petitioners
your
honor,
our
cash
tenants.
mr.
harold
edgar
the
tenant
farmers
here
your
honor
are
those
who
pay
rent
in
cash.
the
secretary
has
not
although
taking
the
new
view
that
land
--
payments
for
land
are
part
of
making
a
crop
does
not
permit
such
assignments
to
be
made
by
share
properties.
mr.
harold
edgar
no,
we
have
the
cash
tenants.
mr.
harold
edgar
they
are
not
--
they
have
not
been
harmed
by
the
change
in
the
definition
although
the
inconsistency
of
the
secretary's
approach
is
made
manifest
by
the
fact
that
he
alters
it
for
purposes
of
paying
cash
rent
yet
not
--
mr.
harold
edgar
mere
error
is
not
--
does
not
give
you
standing,
no
your
honor.
mr.
harold
edgar
well,
the
point
--
my
point
is
your
honor
that
the
merits,
the
question
on
the
merits
is
very
closely
interrelated
to
the
purposes
of
the
act
to
the
extent
that
the
act
does
have
a
purpose
to
protect
to
that
extent
that
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
statutory
language
which
removes
protection
is
less
permissible.
it's
impermissible
as
the
plainness
of
the
congressional
intent
becomes
what
is
found.
mr.
harold
edgar
the
question
on
the
merits
is
whether
the
term
making
a
crop,
the
term
that
has
agricultural
long
legislative
history
but
it
does
not
mean
paying
rent
for
land
whether
the
secretary
can
redefine
it
in
order
to
permit
tenant
farmers
to
pay.
mr.
harold
edgar
no.
no,
your
honor
it
does
not.
mr.
harold
edgar
purely
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
mr.
harold
edgar
approximately
three-and-a-half
years
your
honor.
mr.
harold
edgar
three.
mr.
harold
edgar
i
may
be
mistaken,
i
believe
it's
three.
it
was
66
it
was
brought
--
mr.
harold
edgar
your
honor
it
would
probably
go
back
to
the
fifth
circuit
which
has
already
intimated
its
views.
i
don't
know
what
the
timing
is,
i
would
think
of
another
year
at
least
before
the
fifth
circuit
would
rule
on
the
remand
and
the
case
might
be
heard
again
in
this
court
but
i'm
not
aware
of
the
docket
so
that
will
be
fifth
circuit.
mr.
harold
edgar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
edgar
yes,
your
honor.
sorry
sir.
now
on
this
point
we
are
aware
that
the
secretary
has
issued
regulations
under
section
(d)
10.
the
point
is
however
that
the
secretary
as
the
government
made
clear
in
its
opposition
has
construed
this
regulations
not
to
bar
a
landowner
from
removing
a
tenant
from
the
land
when
he
does
not
assign
his
credit
over.
that
is
the
precise
point
at
issue
respondents
brief
in
opposition
says
that
the
secretary
of
agriculture
informs
the
government
that
that
is
the
way
those
regulations
have
been
construed
that
this
harm
can
continue.
now
the
problem
of
protecting
tenant
farmers
--
mr.
harold
edgar
no,
your
honor
he
cannot,
this
is
the
point
which
i
wish
to
develop.
there
is
a
network
of
federal
regulations
precluding
land
owners
from
terminating
the
tenancy
of
their
tenants.
under
the
d10
regulations,
he
is
not
permitted
to
simply
go
to
his
tenant
and
say
“i'm
sorry,
if
you
can't
pay
your
money
i
don't
want
to
rent
you
anymore,
i'm
raising
the
rent”
he
cannot
raise
the
rent,
he
cannot
alter
the
terms
of
the—well
there
are
limitations
on
his
ability
to
alter
the
terms
of
the
statutes.
mr.
harold
edgar
if
he
can.
if
he
does
not
pay
at
settlement
date
he
can
take
them
off
but
only
on
that
day
and
there
is
this
long
pattern
of
protecting
federal
benefits
against
user
payment
by
landowners
and
this
credit
right
is
right
to
assign
is
another
form
of
federal
benefit.
it
is
being
--
the
secretary
is
permitting
its
use
of
pay
by
it's
--
by
it's
--
by
his
impermissible
redefinition
of
the
term
making
a
crop.
thank
you.
