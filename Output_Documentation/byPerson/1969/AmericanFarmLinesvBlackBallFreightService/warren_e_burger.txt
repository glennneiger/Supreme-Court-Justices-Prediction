what
if
their
answers
have
been
negative
on
the
first
that
they
haven't
made
any
inquiry
and
perhaps
negative
on
the
second,
i'm
not
sure
i
have
with
the
question
in
mind
but
indicating
that
no
one
had
refused
to
furnish
the
service?
chief

e.

what
would
be
the
consequences
if
that's
granted?
that's
just
an
economic
consequence?
chief

is
that

is

you

chief

what
is

what's
your
hypothesis

purpose
of

if
its
down

doesn't
it?
isn't

very

mr.

while

stopped

am
i
interrupting
you
now?
chief

warren
e.

i'm
trying
to
reconcile
the
findings
of

(a)
of
the
appendix,
the
three
and
four,
i
think
you
referred
to
sometime
ago
in
relation
to
the
question
that
mr.
califano
about
the
failure
to
answer
questions
8
and
9.
is
there
anywhere
in
this
record
that
indicates
that
would
shed
some
light
on
the
gap
that
failure
to
answer
those
questions
in
the
original
application
for
the
temporary
authority
and
ultimately,
a
finding
by
the
commission
that
is
right
on
target
on
those
two
points.
chief

warren
e.

what's
the
time
laps?
i
see
that
these
findings
3
and
4
on
368
(a)
are
based
on
verified
statements
of
november
1968.
what
was

of

chief

what's
the
date
of
the
document
that
was

they
fail

8

chief

warren
e.

well
then,
i'm
even
more
confused.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
you
can
clear
that
up
or
someone
can.
i
thought
they
had
fail
to
answer
on
this
two
points
8
and
9
that
the
findings
says
that
by
the
verified
statement,
the
following
things
have
been
established
and
two
of
the
following
items
down
on
3
and
4
are
precisely
the
answers
to
the
question
8

where

did
the

get
the
data
for

chief

warren
e.

well
now,
i
take
it
that
you
are
concerned
about
the
lack
of
underlying
factual
basis
--
chief

warren
e.
burger
--
for
those
two
--
chief

findings
in

important
way.
chief

e.

before
you
to

on

let
me
go

4
again

3

that
troubles
me
on

chief

warren
e.
burger
four
has
the
finding
that
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
establish
that
any
of
the
protesting
carriers
provide
a
service
to
meet
its
needs.
what
if
the
regulations
or
the
case
is
hold
about
where
the
burden
lies
in
establishing
that?
who
had
the
burden
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
you'd
agreed
that
it
might
be
very
sensible
to
have
the
government
carriage
exempt
from
these
provisions
that
congress
hasn't
done
that
as

you
