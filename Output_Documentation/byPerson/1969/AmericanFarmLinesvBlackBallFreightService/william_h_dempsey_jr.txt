mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
responding
to
the
arguments
advanced
by
mr.
califano
and
mr.
cerra,
i
should
like
to
begin
with
the
issue
respecting
the
commission's
regulations
and
then
move
on
to
a
discussion
of
the
second
issue
regarding
the
real
thing
of
the
record
by
the
commission.
now
as
to
the
first
question,
i
would
like
to
if
the
outsets
spend
a
few
moments
discussing
the
statutory
framework
in
which
these
issues
arise.
this
has
nothing
to
do
i
may
note
with
the
tension
between
the
exemption
provisions
of
the
act
relating
the
cooperatives
and
the
other
provisions
of
the
act
because
as
mr.
califano
has
noted
that
congress
settle
that
problem
with
the
enactment
of
legislation
in
1968,
so
that
no
question
respecting
that
legislation
is
before
the
court.
the
relationship
that
seems
to
us
to
be
significant
is
the
relationship
between
the
temporary
authority's
statute
and
those
provisions
of
the
statute
and
the
regulations
that
bear
upon
the
issuance
of
permanent
of
operating
authority.
as
this
court
of
course
is
well
aware,
this
industry
of
interstate
transportation
since
the
time
the
congress
first
in
an
important
way
move
in
its
regulation
in
1887
has
not
been
characterized
by
unlimited
competition.
the
congress
from
the
beginning
of
its
legislative
program
or
a
variety
of
reasons
having
to
do
with
the
protection
of
shippers
and
the
maintenance
of
economic
stability
and
the
key
industry
that
does
that
common
carrier
obligations
has
decided
that
the
public
interest
would
be
best
served
in
and
by
enlarged
by
the
application
of
the
principle
of
regulated
competition.
and
it's
carried
forward
that
judgment
in
each
time
that
it
brought
a
new
mode
of
transportation
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
so
that
today,
we
have
regulation
in
rates
and
in
service
and
most
pertinently
here
in
terms
of
entry
into
the
market.
so
that
in
the
case
of
any
application
for
permanent
operating
authority
of
any
consequence,
there
are
extended
and
the
extensive
proceedings;
evidence,
cross-examination
of
witnesses,
or
hearing
examiner
--
report
of
the
hearing
examiner,
briefs
and
the
appeal
within
the
commission,
perhaps
to
the
full
commission
often
litigation.
all
of
these
were
denied
toward
insuring
that
if
an
application
for
permanent
authority
is
granted,
it
will
be
upon
the
basis
of
a
careful
consideration
and
evaluation
of
all
of
the
facts
that
bear
upon
the
need
for
the
service,
the
competitive
impact
of
a
grant
and
the
ability
and
willingness
of
existing
carriers
to
perform
that
service.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
the
government
transportation,
mr.
justice
harlan
by
motor
carriers
and
rail
and
as
the
department
said
to
a
small
extent
by
air.
by
sort
of
--
by
certificated
carriers
for
the
most
part
by
cooperatives
to
the
extent
that
under
the
new
legislation
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
this
temporary
authority?
oh
no,
your
honor,
no.
under
this
courts
decision
in
pan-atlantic
steamship
company,
as
i
believe
mr.
califano
indicated
a
grant
of
temporary
authority
despite
the
attack,
180-day
limitation
of
the
statute
is
continued
now
until
the
termination
of
the
permanent
authority
proceeding.
now,
in
its
jurisdictional
statement,
afl
estimated
that
and
i
think
that
was
filed
on
july
of
last
year.
afl
estimated
that
it
would
take
another
three
years
for
completion
of
the
permanent
authority
proceeding
and
i
would
consider
that
to
be
a
pretty
good
guess,
so
that
we
face
a
long
period
of
time
of
the
life
of
this
temperate
authority.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
but
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
there
is
a
stay,
there
is
a
stay.
now,
the
temporary
authority
statute
which
was
enacted
in
1938
and
it
has
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
shortly
after
passing
35
motor
carrier
act,
of
course,
cut
sharply
across
the
grain
of
this
general
statutory
scheme
because
it
permits
the
commission
without
hearings
at
its
discretion
to
permit
this
kind
of
authority
to
be
exercised.
and
what
the
commission
said
to
the
congress
quite
sensibly
it
seems
to
me
was
that
there
might
very
well
be
occasions
in
which
a
shipper's
need
was
so
imperative,
so
immediate
that
its
satisfaction
should
not
await
the
conclusion
of
the
often
prolonged
permanent
application
proceedings.
now
what
the
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
enact
the
statue
was
that
it
would
be
limited
to
emergencies.
this
is
what
the
senate
report
said,
such
temporary
grants
would
be
limited
to
situations
in
which
there
was
an
emergency,
and
that
accorded
with
the
kind
of
things
that
the
commission
was
talking
about
to
the
congress
because
it
was
speaking
in
terms
of
new
oil
wells
coming
in
and
the
havoc
that's
brought
by
floods
and
what
it
referred
to
in
short
as
calamities
visitations.
and
the
commission
did
represent
to
the
congress
that
it
recognized
that
need
would
be
--
would
have
to
be
--
care
would
have
to
be
exercised
to
protect
the
interest
of
the
existing
carriers.
and
the
language
that
the
congress
chose
was
well
suited
to
limit
the
application
of
this
statute.
the
congress
spoke
as
the
court
is
aware
in
terms
of
an
immediate
and
urgent
need
for
service
that
no
existing
carrier
could
provide.
now,
it
was
that
statutory
framework
against
which
the
commission
was
called
upon
to
evaluate
afl's
application
for
authority.
it
may
be
that
in
the
annals
of
the
commission,
there
are
applications
that
have
been
granted
that
are
sweeping
in
scope
as
this
one,
but
if
there
are,
we
do
not
know
them
and
the
commission
is
not
preferred
to
them.
these
applications
sought
authority
and
authority
was
granted
to
transport
for
all
branches
of
the
united
states
government,
all
commodities
from
all
points
of
origin
to
all
points
of
destination
in
a
14-state
geographical
area
without
restriction
as
to
roots.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well
it
would
be
single-line
service
because
it
will
be
performed
by
afl.
i
believe
there
is
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
that
there
is
a
provision
in
the
regulations
that
would
prohibit
interlining,
but
i'm
not
absolutely
certain
about
this.
certainly
what
is
contemplated
was
single-line
afl
service.
the
application
was
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
don't
know.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
any
interlining?
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so,
but
i'm,
i'm
--
it
is
in
the
record
and
i'm
an
absolutely
confident
about
it,
but
my
impression
would
be
that
there
is
no.
the
application
was
supported
as
the
court
has
been
advised
by
statement
by
a
single
branch
of
the
government,
the
defense
department.
in
that
statement,
the
department
did
not
state
that
in
the
absence
of
afl's
service,
the
existing
service
would
be
inadequate
and
that
is
not
surprising
because
in
two
letters
that
were
written
by
the
defense
department,
one
to
afl
and
one
to
another
motor
carrier
within
two
weeks
of
the
filing
of
this
support
statement.
the
department
said
this
and
i
quote
that
“the
department
is
not
in
a
position
to
state
that
there
would
be
insufficient
or
inadequate
service
without
american
farm
lines.”
and
then
shortly
after
the
filing
of
the
statement
in
another
letter
that
it
sent
to
american
trucking
associations,
it
said
that
its
support
of
afl
was,
“an
expression
of
the
desire
of
the
department
who
have
available
to
it
the
type
and
quality
of
service
which
afl
has
provided
regardless
of
the
carriers
which
might
provide
the
same.”
so
that
in
our
view,
it
was
not
particularly
astonishing
when
the
temporary
authorities
board
of
the
commission
denied
this
application,
but
as
the
court
has
been
advised
division,
one
of
the
commission
on
appeal
reversed
that
determination,
the
authority
was
granted,
the
protesting
carriers
went
to
courts,
secured
the
temporary
restraining
order,
the
commission
bear
upon
on
its
own
motion
reopened
the
record
and
finally
the
last
deal,
the
statement
the
so-called
caputo
statement
was
put
into
the
record.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
only
their
orders
that
are
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
december
29,
1968
on
page
367
on
the
record.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that's
it,
that's
it.
all
application
were
referred
to
it
i
think
there
is
a
finding
of
sorts
there.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no.
now,
that
brings
me
to
the
question
that's
involved
on
this
first
branch
of
the
case
and
that
is
what
the
caputo
statement
measured
up
to
the
requirements
of
the
regulation.
so
i
--
i
turn
now
to
the
regulations
which
are
set
forth
in
--
i
think,
it
is
appendix
b
to
the
brief
of
certain
motor
carrier
appellees
beginning
on
page
32
of
that
brief.
now
what
the
regulations
say
at
the
outset
is
that
they're
designed
to
implement
the
temporary
authority
statute,
and
i
think
the
first
thing
perhaps
to
notice
that
they
divide
temporary
authority
in
the
two
categories.
one
is
called
the
emergency
temporary
authority
and
the
other
for
--
better
word,
i'll
call
ordinary
temporary
authority.
emergency
temperate
authority
according
to
the
regulations
is
to
be
granted
only
whether
is
an
enough
time
to
provide
notice
to
interested
parties,
and
then
it's
restrictive.
it's
restricted
to
30
days
and
then
it
can
be
continued
only
until
ordinary
temporary
authority
can
be
either
granted
or
denied.
now,
this
case
of
course
is
one
of
ordinary
temporary
authority,
and
the
regulations
that
begin
on
page
37
i
think
clearly
make
this
an
adversary
proceeding
before
the
commission
because
they
require
the
basic
elements
of
an
adversary
proceeding,
they
require
that
notice
be
given
to
interested
persons
in
the
federal
register
and
they
provide
interested
persons
who
are
willing
and
able
or
say
they
are,
to
provide
the
service
have
a
right
to
reply.
they
have
a
right
to
file
a
protest.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
page
37
of
--
mr.
justice
stewart
of
the
brief
of
certain
motor
carrier
appellees.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
now,
it's
a
truncated
proceeding
to
be
sure,
there
is
no
cross-examination
of
witnesses,
the
timetable
is
telescope,
but
it
is
nonetheless
and
adversary
proceedings.
now,
what
the
protestants
are
able
to
put
in
their
rebuttals
of
course
depends
in
large
measure
on
what
the
applicant
is
required
to
put
in
his
application,
and
associated
papers
and
that
brings
me
to
the
regulation
that
is
most
directly
involved
and
that
begins
on
page
34,
subparagraph
c
supporting
statements.
that
regulation
refers
to
the
supporting
statements
of
shippers
and
it
says
this
it
says
that
each
application
or
temporary
authority
must
be
accompanied
by
a
supporting
statement
or
statements
designed
to
established
an
immediate
and
urgent
need
for
service
which
cannot
be
met
by
existing
carriers,
the
statutory
standards.
and
then,
it
goes
on
say
that
any
self-supporting
statement
must
contain
at
least
the
following
information
and
it
sets
forth
11
categories
as
much
mr.
califano
has
indicated
and
of
those
were
concerned
here
basically
with
subparagraphs
7
and
8.
and
the
basic
question
is
whether
the
caputo
statement
compiled
with
the
requirements
of
7
and
8,
and
if
it
didn't,
what
the
consequence
is
ought
to
be?
7
and
8
go
to
what
a
shipper
is
suppose
to
say
is
to
whether
or
not
he
has
made
efforts
to
get
this
service
from
existing
carriers,
and
if
it
has
made
all
those
efforts,
he
is
then
suppose
to
give
the
names
and
the
dates
of
the
allegedly
defaulting
carriers
and
the
reasons
they
assigned
for
not
being
able
to
perform,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
now,
analysis
at
this
point
in
our
view
is
impaired
somewhat
by
the
fact
that
we
believe
that
the
appellants
have
taken
rather
markedly
diverging
views
of
what
the
department
of
defense
said
in
response
to
the
threshold
question
of
subparagraph
8.
now,
that
question
is
whether
efforts
have
been
made
to
obtain
the
service
from
existing
carriers.
american
farm
lines
says
clearly
in
its
brief
and
i
did
not
understand
mr.
califano
to
retreat
from
it
that
dod's
response
to
that
question
was
negative,
that
it
did
not
make
any
such
efforts.
the
argument
is
spelled
forth
at
some
length
on
pages
20,
i
think
20
to
23
of
their
opening
brief
and
their
conclusion
is
this
on
page
22.
in
short,
the
department's
response
to
the
requirements
of
subparagraphs
8
and
9
was
that
it
had
not
requested
the
proposed
service
from
other
carriers,
and
then
it
goes
on
to
explain
why
in
its
view
that
shouldn't
be
fatal,
and
i'll
take
that
up
in
a
moment.
but
now
let
me
turn
--
well,
and
then
its
analysis
proceeds
this
way
and
says
that
as
dod
said
it
did
not
may
be
his
efforts
then
course
the
other
requirements
of
8
and
9
never
came
into
play
because
the
department
couldn't
be
required
to
supply
details
as
to
efforts
that
it
never
made.
now,
the
solicitor
general
on
the
other
hand,
i
understand
not
to
advance
that
argument
but
rather
the
argument
that
indeed
dod
said
--
now,
this
isn't
the
question
i
should
make
clear
as
to
what
dod
actually
did.
this
is
a
question
as
to
what
dod
said
in
its
statement,
no
one
knows
really
what
dod
actually
did.
we
can
only
go
on
the
basis
of
what
it
said.
the
solicitor
general
as
i
read
its
brief,
of
course,
the
government
has
not
argued
this
aspect
of
the
case
so
we
have
to
rely
on
that
brief
i
think.
as
i
understand
their
brief,
they
say
that
the
solicitor
general
did
make
these
efforts
and
that
he
did
provide
--
i
mean,
dod
and
that
the
dod
did
provide
most
of
the
information
are
required
and
really
all
that
ought
to
be
required.
this
is
what
he
says
on
page
16
and
17
of
his
brief.
in
fact
the
statement
of
dod
that
is
did
provide
much
of
the
information
there
specified,
thus
dod
did
state
whether
it
made
efforts
to
obtain
the
service
from
existing
carriers
and
graphically
describe
the
results
of
its
efforts
as
subsection
8
dictates,
and
it
explained
in
detail
the
reasons
whey
existing
carriers
were
only
able
to
provide
the
service
needed
as
subsection
9
contemplates.
we
acknowledge
the
statement
did
not
give
the
dates
of
dod's
efforts
to
secure
service
as
8
further
asks,
or
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
carriers
who
do
not
provide
service
as
9
specifies.
but
these
are
the
only
deficiencies,
and
then
it
goes
on
to
explain
why
he
doesn't
consider
those
fatal
and
i'll
move
on
to
that
in
due
course.
now,
the
good
deal
in
terms
of
how
one
approaches
this
case
depends
upon
which
of
these
views
to
the
dod
statement
is
correct.
in
our
view
the
government
is
the
only
one
that
is
open,
and
that
is
because
the
commission,
mr.
justice
white,
does
have
what
i
consider
to
be
a
finding
of
sorts
here
in
its
order,
and
it
bears
directly
on
this
problem.

top
of
the
page.
the
commission
says
this
in
its
order,
yet
further
appearing
that
by
its
verified
statement
field
november
20,
1968,
the
department
of
defense
has
established
that
it
has
attempted
but
has
been
unable
to
obtain
the
required
and
necessary
type
of
service.
not
that
it
has
not
attempted
as
afl
indicated
and
that
quotation
that
i
read
from
it
brief.
so
the
number
well
established
doctrine
emerging
from
decisions
of
this
court
such
as
that
in
the
chenery
case
and
the
burlington
truck
lines
case,
we
suggest
that
the
order
of
the
commission
has
to
be
defended
upon
the
grounds
that
it
put
it
on.
and
therefore
that
this
argument
that
afl
advances
here
newly
devised,
advance
here
i
think
for
the
first
time
in
this
litigation
is
simply
not
open.but
i
would
like
to
say
that
there
are
additional
infirmities
in
it.
i'd
like
to
touch
on
those
for
a
moment.
because
of
course
normally
if
the
shipper
says
that
he
hasn't
made
any
efforts
to
get
the
service
that
he
wants
from
existing
carriers,
that
would
be
fatal.
not
because
of
noncompliance
with
the
regulations,
but
because
of
noncompliance
with
the
statute.
he
simply
would
not
have
made
this
sufficient
showing.
now,
afl
says
that
that
shouldn't
be
the
case
here
because
as
mr.
califano
said
what
dod
wanted
was
single-line
direct
route
service
and
it
knew
that
wasn't
available
from
existing
carriers
between
many
of
the
points,
and
therefore
it
would
have
been
bootless
for
them
as
for
it.
and
they
add
that
single-line
direct
route
service
is
obviously
superior
to
joint
line
service.
well,
i
think
they
summarize
your
position
quite
succinctly
in
the
reply
brief
back
on
page
13.
this
is
what
afl
says,
the
department
made
clear
that
it
support
for
afl
way
premise
not
upon
service
failures
but
upon
the
department's
desire
to
upgrade
the
quality
and
to
reduce
the
cost
of
the
motor
transportation
service
available
to
it
through
the
certification
of
direct
single-line
service.
now,
have
that
been
the
argument
made
by
dod
and
explicitly
to
the
commission,
we
suggest
that
the
commission
surely
would
have
concluded
or
surely
should
have
conclude
at
least
that
for
the
reasons
i've
already
indicated,
the
temporary
authority
statue
was
simply
not
designed
to
permit
the
short
circuiting
of
all
of
the
other
procedures
of
the
act
simply
in
order
to
upgrade
the
quality
and
reduce
the
cost
of
the
service
available.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that's
because
it's
not
urgent
and
immediate.
that's
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
now
so
far
as
cost
is
concerned,
the
commission
has
never
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no,
no
i
don't
mr.
justice
brennan.
certainly
in
the
order,
the
commission
never
suggested
that
it
was
considering
cost
savings
from
the
government,
and
indeed,
i
can
provide
the
court
citations
in
which
the
commission
has
said
that
even
in
permanent
authority
cases,
a
rate
question
is
not
irrelevant
factor.
now
of
course,
we're
talking
about
this
enormous
savings.
we're
not
talking
about
this
particular
case
either
in
the
american
farm
lines
having
single-line
direct
writ
authority.
it's
not
going
to
save
the
government
this
money,
monumental
sum
of
money.
but
if
every
carrier,
if
the
entire
certification
scheme
under
the
act
is
to
be
abandoned
now
and
every
carrier,
west
of
the
mississippi
is
to
have
direct
single-line
authority,
well
i
don't
doubt
that
there
would
be
very
considerable
savings.
i
don't
doubt
that
al
lot
of
carriers
would
go
on
to
business.
i
don't
doubt
that
the
commission
would
regard
this
all
as
a
very
complicated
and
difficult
question.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
excuse
me?
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
you
mean
the
pipe
line?
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know.
i
--
it's
a
--
perhaps,
i
can
respond
this
way.
if
the
defense
department
had
said
that
what
we're
talking
about
here
ammunitions
destined
for
vietnam
and
here
the
points
of
origin,
and
here
are
the
points
of
destination
nor
or
aircraft
parts
or
something
that
sort,
and
to
be
sure
we're
only
talking
in
terms
of
saving
a
day
or
saving
12
hours
from
east
to
west
or
something
of
that
sort
but
that's
very
important
because
fighting
men
are
depending
on
this
material.
well
i
mean,
i
would
never
suggest
that
that
would
be
irrelevant
consideration
in
a
highly
persuasive
consideration
under
the
temporary
authority.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no
sir,
mr.
justice
white
and
i
refer
here
to
the
regulation.
the
regulation
that
you
discussed
with
mr.
califano
--
mr.
cerra,
i
believe
was,
is
a
regulation
that
we
set
forth
quoted
in
full
in
at
pages
50
and
51
of
our
opening
brief.
now,
it's
never
been
mentioned
by
the
appellants
until
your
colloquy
with
mr.
cerra.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
regulation
says
pretty
clear
that
whatever
theoretical
advantages
may
be
thought
to
be
associated
with
single-line
service
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
or
practical,
if
you
can
that
way,
will
not
be
enough
in
a
temporary
authority
proceeding.
one
have
must
show
some
sort
of
unusual
and
significant
actual
default
in
the
part
of
the
existing
joint
line
carriers.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
not
at
all.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
shed
light
on
it,
but
i
think
what
there
is
in
the
record
only
makes
it
more
surprising
if
i
may
say
because
the
caputo
statement
after
all
was
not
written
in
the
dark.
it
was
submitted
to
the
commission
some
roughly
a
month
after
judge
boldt
in
the
hearing
on
the
temporary
restraining
order
identified
noncompliance
with
subparagraphs
8
and
9
as
a
serious
problem
in
his
mind.
so
that
what
one
would
reasonably
expect
would
be
that
the
defense
department
in
putting
in
another
statement
would
have
been
particularly
careful
to
comply
with
subparagraphs
8
and
9.
i
can
only
--
well,
i
shouldn't
assume
anything.
i
should
simply
answer
and
the
answer
to
the
question
i
think
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that
is
the
date
of
the
caputo
statement,
the
final
dod
statement.
the
hearing
on
the
temporary
restraining
order,
i
believe
was
in
october.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well,
the
november
20,
this
statement
that's
being
referred
to
here
is
the
only
dod
statement
that
is
being
spoken
up
in
any
respect
now.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well
as
to
finding
3
or
in
subparagraph
3,
i
assume
that
the
commission
thought
that
a
fair
inference
from
what
the
defense
department's
statements
said,
and
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
it
was
not
a
fair
inference.
now
our
complaint
of
course
is
that
having
said
that
they
did
attempt
to
get
the
service
they
wanted,
they
were
then
required
to
comply
with
the
other
parts
of
subparagraphs
8
and
9
and
provide
the
details.
so,
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes,
that's
right
and
let
me
move
directly
to
that.
i
just
--
on
the
single-line
authority
problem,
i
just
like
to
make
sure
i
made
one
final
point
on
it,
and
then
--
let
me
move
directly
into
that.
i
think
that
really
conclusive
evidence
that
the
commission
did
not
issue
this
authority
on
the
premise
advance
now
by
afl;
that
is
the
desirability
of
single-line
services,
the
fact
that
they
didn't
limit,
they
did
not
limit
it
to
those
points
between
which
various
exist
no
single-line
direct
service.
it's
simply
a
broad
14-state
geographical
ground.
so
far
as
the
extra
record
material
that
cited
in
afl's
reply
brief
is
concerned
with
respect
to
the
statements
made
by
some
appellees
about
the
desirability
of
single-line
service,
those
statements
were
made
in
the
context
of
applications
for
permanent
authority
and
for
reasons
that
i've
already
indicated
that's
much
different
than
an
application
for
temporary
authority.
but
i
would
cite
to
the
court
since
we
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
reply,
to
icc
examiner's
decisions
in
this
chain
of
litigation
going
on
before
the
commission.

in
both
of
these
cases,
the
examiner
in
permanent
authority
cases
denied
single-line
authority
direct
routes
sought
by
the
defense
department
upon
substantially
the
same
grounds
as
they
sought
this
authority
criticizing
the
defense
department
for
not
establishing
sufficiently
the
asserted
deficiencies
in
multiple
line
service.
now,
i
don't
say
that
this
is
terribly
important,
but
i
do
say
that's
--
it
is
indicative
of
the
kind
of
evidence
that
has
to
be
introduced
when
one
realize
on
the
single-line
authority
concept
even
in
a
permanent
authority
case.
now,
mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
go
into
this
question
of
what
it
is
that
we
complain
about
in
terms
of
the
government
side
which
i
understand
to
be
that
there
where
depots.
the
solicitor
general
says
that
yes,
the
caputo
statement
did
not
give
names,
dates,
particulars
about
the
service
deficiencies
about
which
it
was
complained,
but
he
says
that
shouldn't
matter
and
--
so
i
guess
really,
the
basic
question
is
whether
it
should
matter
or
not.
there
isn't
any
question
i
think
that
he's
right
in
making
the
concession
that
does
in
this
entire
dod
statement,
not
a
single,
not
a
single
existing
allegedly
defaulting
carrier
is
named.
no
dates,
no
names
and
no
particulars.
we
suggest
that
the
standard
to
be
used
in
measuring
whether
or
not
this
is
--
if
i
may
for
a
lack
of
a
better
word
say
prejudicial
error
ought
to
be
the
traditional
one
and
ought
to
be
whether
have
the
error
and
not
been
committed
might
the
outcome
have
been
changed.
the
government
says
that
it
would
not
have
been.
they
say
on
their
brief
that
the
provision
of
these
details
could
not
be
affected
the
outcome
and
i
understand
them
to
say
that
on
the
notion
that
the
evidence
of
record
was
compelled.
now,
that's
kind
of
a
harmless
error
doctrine.
it
seems
to
us
it
has
no
place
unless
the
evidence
that's
being
relied
upon
is
compelling
is
independent
of
the
error;
that
is
to
say
that
correction
of
the
error
would
not
have
affected
that
evidence.
now
if
you
got
20
eyewitnesses
to
a
crime
and
they
all
identified
the
defendant
in
a
trial
and
the
trial
judge
improperly
circumscribes
cross-examination
going
to
the
eyesight
and
one
of
them,
well
maybe
that's
harmless
error.
but
that
situation
does
not
resemble
the
one
at
bar
at
all
because
the
provision
of
the
details
by
dod
might
radically
have
undercut
the
force
of
its
submission.
now,
i
don't
have
the
time
in
oral
argument
for
the
kind
of
detailed
textual
analysis
of
this
statement
that
we
do
have
in
the
briefs,
but
let
me
illustrate
to
the
court
what
kind
of
thing
i
have
in
mind.
the
most
important
parts
of
the
statement
are
generalities.
they're
always
qualified
in
what
we
regard
as
suggestive
way.
now
for
example,
page
368
of
the
caputo
statement,
the
statement
--
no,
that‘s
not
a
statement,
that's
the
order.
the
statement
begins
on
194,
i
think,
yes.
page
198
contains
what
is
sort
the
topics
sentence
of
the
statement.
there,
mr.
caputo
says
this
defense
need
for
speed
has
not
been
met
in
many,
many
instances
by
the
current
certified
motor
carriers.
now,
no
place
in
this
statement
does
he
indicate
anything
about
those
many,
many
instances.
i
suppose
arithmetically,
that
could
50
or
100
or
a
150
or
almost
any
figure,
but
surely
it
would
make
a
difference
if
it
were
only
a
50
in
this
broad
geographical
area
among
these
dozens
of
carriers,
and
i
don't
really
see
how
it
reasonably
could
be
suggested
otherwise.
in
the
next
sentence
he
says
--
and
let
me
just
string
some
of
these
together
because
they're
all
really
the
same.
in
the
next
paragraph,
he
says
we
must
in
some
cases
allow
no
less
than
24
hours
for
each
300
miles
of
joint
line
service,
some
cases.
the
next
sentence
he
said,
prescribe
routes
are
often
circuitous.
in
the
next
paragraph
he
says,
some
regular
route
carriers
utilize
single
drivers
instead
of
two-men
driving
teams
and
this
sometimes
results
in
delays.
the
next
page
he
says,
some
shipments
of
explosives
between
mcallister
and
vanguard
transit
for
lengthy
periods
of
time.
and
it's
that
way
throughout.
in
many
instances,
it
is
necessary
to
closely
coordinate
the
arrival
of
inbound
shipments
with
production
schedules.
he
gives
one
example,
how
many
are
many
in
addition
to
one?
in
the
next
page
he
says
dod
has
experience
situations
where
shipments
routed
the
currently
certificated
carriers
failed
to
arrive
at
destination
in
time
for
transshipments
and
it
gives
one
example
there.
how
many
more
times
beyond
one
did
dod
actually
experienced
these
situations?
now,
he
does
provide
in
his
statements
some
what
he
calls
examples.
we've
analyzed
them
one
by
one
in
our
brief
and
i
won't
detain
the
court
with
the
flaws
that
we
see
in
the
examples
other
than
to
note
that
again
that
they
did
not
comply
with
the
regulations.
the
allegedly
defaulting
carriers
were
not
identified.
they
had
no
opportunity
of
rebuttal.
but
beyond
that,
i
suggest
that
the
fact
that
dod
did
provide
some
examples
cuts
in
our
favor
and
not
against
us
because
in
the
first
place,
it
shows
they
can
provide
examples.
and
in
the
second
place,
one
cannot
put
aside
the
possibility
mr.
chief
justice
that
this
is
about
all
they
could
come
up
with.
because
as
i
said
before,
they
grafted
the
statement
in
the
face
of
the
temporary
restraining
order
which
pointed
to
noncompliance
with
subparagraphs
8
and
9
as
a
problem.
they
went
back
and
they
drafted
it
and
i
think
it
is
at
least
reasonable,
it
is
reasonably
possible
to
assume
that
this
was
about
as
good
as
they
could
do.
but
if
that's
a
possibility,
then
surely
compliance
with
the
regulations,
compelling
the
department
to
deploy
with
the
regulations
might
entirely
have
change
the
outcome
of
this
case
because
if
this
handful
of
examples
is
all
that
the
department
could
come
up
with.
i
would
find
it
very
difficult
to
believe
that
the
commission
would
have
granted
this
temporary
authority.
and
i
have
not
spoken
of
the
possibility
of
rebuttal,
but
that
possibility
could
not
be
put
aside
either
as
this
record
demonstrates,
the
department
is
not
always
infallible
in
what
it
says.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
statement
of
the
munitions
carrier's
conference
which
is
here
some
place.
what
the
--
let
me
just
summarize
what
it
says,
what
it
says
--
here
it
is,
it's
on
page
308
and
309
and
what
it
says
basically
is
that,
that
dod
in
one
of
its
statements
gave
before
this
caputo
statement
gave
three
examples
of
what
are
deserted
and
were
deficiencies.
and
those
--
two
of
them
could
be
verified
in
terms
of
the
carriers
that
were
involved
and
those
carriers
put
in
rebuttals.
one
of
them
indeed
as
the
statement
says
submitted
photo
static
copies
of
documents
which
established
of
the
charge
was
false,
and
dod
did
not
repeat
any
of
those
in
the
caputo
statement.
so
that
the
opportunity
to
rebut
specific
data,
when
that's
specific
data
is
given
by
the
dod
is
important
to
the
appellees.
i
should
mention
estes
briefly
but
i
think
mr.
califano
really
has
given
me
my
basis
for
distinguishing
estes
it's
the
one
that
i
rely
on,
there
are
several
but
the
shippers
in
estes
as
mr.
califano
said
stated
very
explicitly
that
they
have
not
made
any
efforts
to
get
the
service
that
they
were
interested
in
from
other
carriers.
so
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no,
i
think
it
would
be
never
justified
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
oh,
right,
yes,
i
found
that
interesting
passage
in
this
letter
and
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
you
will
not
find
in
the
caputo
statement
a
repudiation
of
the
three
letters
that
dod
wrote
and
which
the
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that
they
--
well,
i
--
it's
not
illogical?
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
it's
not
internally
inconsistent.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes,
yes,
well
you
might
as
a
matter
of
fact.
i
mean
it's
possible.
all
that
i
can
say
is
that
when
you
can
--
i
think
you
can
visualize
a
company
in
extreme
financial
client
or
something
like
that
might
really
need
better
service.
but
it's
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
the
commission
having
set
forth
in
its
single-line
service
regulations
pretty
clearly
an
indication
of
this
isn't
the
case,
and
the
commission
after
all
does
know
what
the
statute
says
and
what
the
history
of
the
statute
was.
i
think
that
what
the
commission
must
have
done
here
was
to
accept
the
general
statements
made
by
dod
in
the
caputo
statement
in
terms
of
what
it
said
where
its
actual
service
failures
that
in
many,
many
instances
they
haven't
gotten
goods
on
time
for
transshipment
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
based
their
decision
base
on
the
order
on
that
and
not
upon
a
mere
statement
by
dod
of
a
preference
for
better
service.
now
if
in
this
order,
i
certainly
don't
suggest
that
this
order
is
a
model
of
clarity
far
from
it,
but
if
in
this
order
the
commission
had
said
which
you
just
suggested
mr.
justice
white,
then
the
litigation
that
seems
to
me
would
have
taken
an
entirely
different
path.
what
we
would
have
been
arguing
in
lower
court
was
that
the
order
did
not
comply
with
the
statute
and
with
that
kind
of
a
fine
thing
by
the
commission
we
would
have
tested
this
on
a
different
basis.
let
me
spend
what
remaining
time
i
have
on
the
second
issue
in
the
case,
the
question
respecting
the
commission's
reopening
of
the
record.
i
regret
that
i
do
not
have
more
time
for
this
because
it
is
an
important
issue
bearing
as
it
does
upon
the
commission's
relation
to
the
federal
judiciary.
but
we
have
set
forth
our
arguments
in
our
briefs
in
detail
and
of
course,
we
rely
upon
them.
let
me
try
simply
to
touch
upon
the
highlights
over
the
central
factors
of
these
issues.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
oh,
well,
i
think
clearly
the
applicant
has
the
burden
under
the
regulation
say
and
particularly
if
they're
talking
about
single-line
service
because
that
requires
in
terms
of
the
regulations
are
clearly
showing
that
the
existing
carriers
have
defaulted.
i
don't
think
really
that
commission
counsel
would
disagree
that
the
burden
here
is
on
the
applicant
especially
in
terms
of
the
concern
of
the
congress
expressed
in
the
committee
reports
that
this
temporary
authority
statute
be
utilized
only
in
a
emergencies
as
it
is
an
exception
to
the
general
statutory
scheme.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
exempt
from
the
--
from
which
provision
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no,
i
would
not
--
if
i
understand
the
question
right
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i
don't
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
and
certainly
they
done
it.
they
have
exempted
the
government
from
the
rate
discrimination
provisions
of
the
legislations
so
that
they
can
and
effect
that
the
rate
discrimination
in
favor
of
the
government.
they've
done
that,
but
they
haven't
done
anything
with
respect
to
the
routings
that
are
to
be
used
during
that
sort.
but
i
should
say
that
the
importance
of
government
traffic
to
the
regulated
motor
carrier
industry
in
particularly
to
some
elements
of
it
is
very,
very
great.
and
the
commission
will
one
way
or
another
in
the
many,
many
proceedings
that
are
pending
before
it
now
seeking
modification
of
routes
and
that
sort
of
thing
will
have
to
decide
how
this
problem
can
be
worked
out
so
as
to
provide
the
best
service
to
the
department
without
working,
undo
damage
on
the
existing
motor
and
rail
carriers.
i
think
that's
a
complex
problem,
and
so
i
would
much
prefer
to
see
that
worked
out
in
permanent
authority
applications
with
full
hearings
than
by
way
of
this
kind
of
summary
proceeding.
now,
i
would
gather
from
mr.
cerra's
argument
that
perhaps
erroneously
but
let
me
just
state
what
i
seem
to
feel
about
it,
and
that
is
that
if
these
petitions
for
reconsideration
have
not
been
pending
at
that
time
that
the
commission
reopened
the
record,
there
would
not
be
a
very
strenuous
argument
from
the
other
side
that
the
commission
was
free
to
do
what
it
did.
but
if
i
incorrectly
surmise
that
in
any
event,
i
think
that's
what
the
appellants
ought
to
be
conceding
because
inland
steel
in
the
--
this
court
in
establishing
that
the
commission
cannot
act
in
a
way
inconsistent
with
the
commission's
jurisdiction
taking
together
with
the
other
cases
that
we
have
cited
which
in
other
context
indicated
what
that
sort
of
thing
means.
it
seems
to
me
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
where
the
commission
in
effect
wipes
out
the
raise
of
the
litigation,
they're
acting
inconsistently
with
the
court's
jurisdiction,
and
that's
what
the
commission
did
here.
in
effect,
it
wiped
out
the
order
that
was
under
view.
it
reopened
the
record
in
effect
that
a
new
trial
and
entered
in
effect
a
new
judgment
which
was
then
subject
to
further
appeal.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
turning
question
here
is
the
effect
of
the
pending
petitions
for
reconsideration.
our
first
position
on
that
is
that
those
petitions
for
reconsideration
could
not
have
extended
the
authority
of
the
commission
because
they
were
not
authorized.
the
regulation
respecting
petitions
for
reconsiderations
in
temporary
authority
proceedings
is
set
forth
on
page
47
of
the
brief
of
certain
motor
carrier
appellees.
now,
it
identifies
two
kinds
of
orders
from
which
such
petitions
can
be
taken
and
this
case
does
not
involved
either
one
of
them
that
i
think
is
conceivable.
but
what
mr.
cerra
says
is
that
the
general
rules
of
practice
of
the
commission
do
authorize
a
petition
for
reconsideration
in
these
circumstances.
and
that
that
rule
should
be
ready
into
the
temporary
authority
rule
because
the
temporary
authority
rule
starts
out
pursuant
to
and
in
accordance
with
the
commission's
general
and
special
rules
of
practice.
now,
we
think
that
the
a
more
normal
reading
of
that
phrase
pursuant
to
and
in
accordance
with
would
be
to
refer
to
procedural
questions
such
as
a
number
of
copies
and
that
sort
of
thing.
but
more
important
than
that,
if
the
general
rules
and
the
special
rules
are
read
into
this
rule,
then
this
rule
is
robbed
of
any
independent
significance
because
the
petitions
for
reconsideration
that
are
authorize
by
this
rule
are
also
authorize
by
the
general
and
special
rules.
so
that
to
give
it
any
meaning,
one
must
read
it
restrictively.
one
must
conclude
that
this
rule
establishes
the
only
circumstances
under
which
petitions
for
reconsideration
are
to
be
permitted
in
temporary
authority
proceedings.
if
i
may
add
that
there
is
no
support
here
to
the
court
and
no
help
to
the
court
by
way
of
the
construction
of
these
regulations
by
the
commission.
the
commission
in
no
order
construed
these
regulations
to
permit
these
petitions
for
reconsideration.
it
reopened
the
proceeding
on
its
own
motion.
there
is
a
reference
in
a
footnote
and
afl's
brief
to
the
effect
that
that
is
not
so
and
that
the
commission
indicated
that
it
believed
the
petitions
were
authorized
but
i
refer
the
court
to
the
record
citation.
it
is
to
a
brief
by
commission
counsel
and
the
court
below.
but
beyond
that,
we
say
that
even
if
the
petitions
were
not
authorized
that
the
results
should
be
the
same.
and
we
say
that
fundamentally
because
we
think
if
the
result
is
different,
that
an
important
policy
consideration
underlying
the
principle
restricting
agency
freedom
in
the
context
of
judicial
review
would
be
undercut.
and
that
policy
we
think
arises
from
the
dual
role
of
the
agency.
it
is
of
course
first
and
foremost
the
neutral
arbiter,
but
then
when
its
orders
are
attacked
it
becomes
a
litigant.
now,
so
long
as
the
litigation
is
simply
conducted
by
the
general
counsel's
office,
there's
no
possibility
of
conflict
of
interest.
but
where
the
commission
reopens
the
procedure
after
judicial
review
has
commenced
and
particularly
where
the
court
has
identified
would
it
seize
as
a
possible
difficulty
in
the
commission's
position.
then
we
suggest
that
there
is
a
risk
that
the
agency
will
add
it
more
as
a
litigator
than
as
an
arbiter.
now,
the
counsel
for
the
commission
says
yes,
but
--
well,
he
doesn't
say
yes
to
that,
but
he
says
in
connection
with
this
point
that
one
must
allow
the
commission
the
right
to
correct
errors
and
certainly
that's
true,
and
that's
an
important
policy
consideration.
but
first
of
all,
the
rule
that
we're
arguing
for
it
doesn't
deny
the
agency
the
right
to
do
that.
it
simply
requires
that
the
agency
get
the
authority
of
the
court
to
do
whatever
it
wishes
to
do.
and
in
the
second
place,
the
facts
of
this
case,
well
certainly
not
conclusive
one
way
or
the
other,
do
not
fit
very
neatly
we
suggest
into
the
notion
that
what
the
commission
is
doing
here
was
correcting
error
in
that
alone.
the
government
in
a
footnote
to
its
brief
indicates
that
the
commission
had
in
mind
when
it
reopened
the
record,
this
problem
respecting
subparagraphs
8
and
9
of
the
regulations.
but
if
that
is
so,
you
didn't
do
anything
about
that
problem
at
least
directly.
it
did
not
suggest
to
the
department
if
they
comply
with
subparagraphs
8
and
9.
it
did
not
direct
the
attention
of
the
department
to
subparagraphs
8
and
9.
what
it
did
was
to
reopen
the
record
and
take
additional
evidence
from
the
department
and
then
its
counsel
returned
to
court
below
as
they
do
here
and
conceive
that
there
were
defaults
with
respect
to
the
compliance
with
these
regulations
as
judge
boldt
indicated
in
that
very
first
hearing,
but
argued
that
the
additional
evidence
that
was
taken
was
so
compelling
as
to
outweigh
these
problems
with
respect
to
the
regulation.
as
i
say,
i
don't
suggest
that
these
facts
are
conclusive
with
respect
to
this
risk
that
i'm
talking
about,
but
they're
not
inconsistent
at
least
with
the
theory
that
i
advance.
and
so
what
we
argue
for
and
i
may
say
it
seems
to
me
that
what's
needed
here
is
a
rule.
there
ought
to
be
a
clear
cut
rule.
i
don't
suggest
that
this
is
a
--
that
the
policy
consideration
is
either
way
here
are
so
strong
as
to
establish
that
we're
right
or
we're
wrong.
what
i
do
say
is
that
we
think
that
the
burden
on
the
commission
in
complying
with
the
rule
that
we're
talking
about
would
be
very,
very
slight
indeed.
whereas,
the
risk
of
danger
on
the
other
side
is
reasonably
significant
and
so
what
we
urge
is
a
rule
that
would
require
the
commission
when
should
this
review
is
commence
or
at
the
very
least,
after
the
court
has
taken
a
significant
step
in
the
case.
and
that
here
was
the
grant
of
the
temporary
restraining
order
after
a
full
hearing.
but
at
that
point,
the
commission
then
be
required
to
go
to
the
court,
seek
authorization
if
it
wishes
to
reopen
the
record
and
enter
a
new
order.
we
think
that
as
i
say,
that's
a
slight
burden
on
the
commission.
it
prevents
any
hazards
with
respect
to
the
legitimate
interest
of
the
parties
before
the
commission.
that
i
think
summarizes
our
case
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
responding
to
the
arguments
advanced
by
mr.
califano
and
mr.
cerra,
i
should
like
to
begin
with
the
issue
respecting
the
commission's
regulations
and
then
move
on
to
a
discussion
of
the
second
issue
regarding
the
real
thing
of
the
record
by
the
commission.
now
as
to
the
first
question,
i
would
like
to
if
the
outsets
spend
a
few
moments
discussing
the
statutory
framework
in
which
these
issues
arise.
this
has
nothing
to
do
i
may
note
with
the
tension
between
the
exemption
provisions
of
the
act
relating
the
cooperatives
and
the
other
provisions
of
the
act
because
as
mr.
califano
has
noted
that
congress
settle
that
problem
with
the
enactment
of
legislation
in
1968,
so
that
no
question
respecting
that
legislation
is
before
the
court.
the
relationship
that
seems
to
us
to
be
significant
is
the
relationship
between
the
temporary
authority's
statute
and
those
provisions
of
the
statute
and
the
regulations
that
bear
upon
the
issuance
of
permanent
of
operating
authority.
as
this
court
of
course
is
well
aware,
this
industry
of
interstate
transportation
since
the
time
the
congress
first
in
an
important
way
move
in
its
regulation
in
1887
has
not
been
characterized
by
unlimited
competition.
the
congress
from
the
beginning
of
its
legislative
program
or
a
variety
of
reasons
having
to
do
with
the
protection
of
shippers
and
the
maintenance
of
economic
stability
and
the
key
industry
that
does
that
common
carrier
obligations
has
decided
that
the
public
interest
would
be
best
served
in
and
by
enlarged
by
the
application
of
the
principle
of
regulated
competition.
and
it's
carried
forward
that
judgment
in
each
time
that
it
brought
a
new
mode
of
transportation
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
so
that
today,
we
have
regulation
in
rates
and
in
service
and
most
pertinently
here
in
terms
of
entry
into
the
market.
so
that
in
the
case
of
any
application
for
permanent
operating
authority
of
any
consequence,
there
are
extended
and
the
extensive
proceedings;
evidence,
cross-examination
of
witnesses,
or
hearing
examiner
--
report
of
the
hearing
examiner,
briefs
and
the
appeal
within
the
commission,
perhaps
to
the
full
commission
often
litigation.
all
of
these
were
denied
toward
insuring
that
if
an
application
for
permanent
authority
is
granted,
it
will
be
upon
the
basis
of
a
careful
consideration
and
evaluation
of
all
of
the
facts
that
bear
upon
the
need
for
the
service,
the
competitive
impact
of
a
grant
and
the
ability
and
willingness
of
existing
carriers
to
perform
that
service.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
the
government
transportation,
mr.
justice
harlan
by
motor
carriers
and
rail
and
as
the
department
said
to
a
small
extent
by
air.
by
sort
of
--
by
certificated
carriers
for
the
most
part
by
cooperatives
to
the
extent
that
under
the
new
legislation
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
this
temporary
authority?
oh
no,
your
honor,
no.
under
this
courts
decision
in
pan-atlantic
steamship
company,
as
i
believe
mr.
califano
indicated
a
grant
of
temporary
authority
despite
the
attack,
180-day
limitation
of
the
statute
is
continued
now
until
the
termination
of
the
permanent
authority
proceeding.
now,
in
its
jurisdictional
statement,
afl
estimated
that
and
i
think
that
was
filed
on
july
of
last
year.
afl
estimated
that
it
would
take
another
three
years
for
completion
of
the
permanent
authority
proceeding
and
i
would
consider
that
to
be
a
pretty
good
guess,
so
that
we
face
a
long
period
of
time
of
the
life
of
this
temperate
authority.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
but
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
there
is
a
stay,
there
is
a
stay.
now,
the
temporary
authority
statute
which
was
enacted
in
1938
and
it
has
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
shortly
after
passing
35
motor
carrier
act,
of
course,
cut
sharply
across
the
grain
of
this
general
statutory
scheme
because
it
permits
the
commission
without
hearings
at
its
discretion
to
permit
this
kind
of
authority
to
be
exercised.
and
what
the
commission
said
to
the
congress
quite
sensibly
it
seems
to
me
was
that
there
might
very
well
be
occasions
in
which
a
shipper's
need
was
so
imperative,
so
immediate
that
its
satisfaction
should
not
await
the
conclusion
of
the
often
prolonged
permanent
application
proceedings.
now
what
the
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
enact
the
statue
was
that
it
would
be
limited
to
emergencies.
this
is
what
the
senate
report
said,
such
temporary
grants
would
be
limited
to
situations
in
which
there
was
an
emergency,
and
that
accorded
with
the
kind
of
things
that
the
commission
was
talking
about
to
the
congress
because
it
was
speaking
in
terms
of
new
oil
wells
coming
in
and
the
havoc
that's
brought
by
floods
and
what
it
referred
to
in
short
as
calamities
visitations.
and
the
commission
did
represent
to
the
congress
that
it
recognized
that
need
would
be
--
would
have
to
be
--
care
would
have
to
be
exercised
to
protect
the
interest
of
the
existing
carriers.
and
the
language
that
the
congress
chose
was
well
suited
to
limit
the
application
of
this
statute.
the
congress
spoke
as
the
court
is
aware
in
terms
of
an
immediate
and
urgent
need
for
service
that
no
existing
carrier
could
provide.
now,
it
was
that
statutory
framework
against
which
the
commission
was
called
upon
to
evaluate
afl's
application
for
authority.
it
may
be
that
in
the
annals
of
the
commission,
there
are
applications
that
have
been
granted
that
are
sweeping
in
scope
as
this
one,
but
if
there
are,
we
do
not
know
them
and
the
commission
is
not
preferred
to
them.
these
applications
sought
authority
and
authority
was
granted
to
transport
for
all
branches
of
the
united
states
government,
all
commodities
from
all
points
of
origin
to
all
points
of
destination
in
a
14-state
geographical
area
without
restriction
as
to
roots.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well
it
would
be
single-line
service
because
it
will
be
performed
by
afl.
i
believe
there
is
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
that
there
is
a
provision
in
the
regulations
that
would
prohibit
interlining,
but
i'm
not
absolutely
certain
about
this.
certainly
what
is
contemplated
was
single-line
afl
service.
the
application
was
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
don't
know.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
any
interlining?
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so,
but
i'm,
i'm
--
it
is
in
the
record
and
i'm
an
absolutely
confident
about
it,
but
my
impression
would
be
that
there
is
no.
the
application
was
supported
as
the
court
has
been
advised
by
statement
by
a
single
branch
of
the
government,
the
defense
department.
in
that
statement,
the
department
did
not
state
that
in
the
absence
of
afl's
service,
the
existing
service
would
be
inadequate
and
that
is
not
surprising
because
in
two
letters
that
were
written
by
the
defense
department,
one
to
afl
and
one
to
another
motor
carrier
within
two
weeks
of
the
filing
of
this
support
statement.
the
department
said
this
and
i
quote
that
“the
department
is
not
in
a
position
to
state
that
there
would
be
insufficient
or
inadequate
service
without
american
farm
lines.”
and
then
shortly
after
the
filing
of
the
statement
in
another
letter
that
it
sent
to
american
trucking
associations,
it
said
that
its
support
of
afl
was,
“an
expression
of
the
desire
of
the
department
who
have
available
to
it
the
type
and
quality
of
service
which
afl
has
provided
regardless
of
the
carriers
which
might
provide
the
same.”
so
that
in
our
view,
it
was
not
particularly
astonishing
when
the
temporary
authorities
board
of
the
commission
denied
this
application,
but
as
the
court
has
been
advised
division,
one
of
the
commission
on
appeal
reversed
that
determination,
the
authority
was
granted,
the
protesting
carriers
went
to
courts,
secured
the
temporary
restraining
order,
the
commission
bear
upon
on
its
own
motion
reopened
the
record
and
finally
the
last
deal,
the
statement
the
so-called
caputo
statement
was
put
into
the
record.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
only
their
orders
that
are
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
december
29,
1968
on
page
367
on
the
record.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that's
it,
that's
it.
all
application
were
referred
to
it
i
think
there
is
a
finding
of
sorts
there.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no.
now,
that
brings
me
to
the
question
that's
involved
on
this
first
branch
of
the
case
and
that
is
what
the
caputo
statement
measured
up
to
the
requirements
of
the
regulation.
so
i
--
i
turn
now
to
the
regulations
which
are
set
forth
in
--
i
think,
it
is
appendix
b
to
the
brief
of
certain
motor
carrier
appellees
beginning
on
page
32
of
that
brief.
now
what
the
regulations
say
at
the
outset
is
that
they're
designed
to
implement
the
temporary
authority
statute,
and
i
think
the
first
thing
perhaps
to
notice
that
they
divide
temporary
authority
in
the
two
categories.
one
is
called
the
emergency
temporary
authority
and
the
other
for
--
better
word,
i'll
call
ordinary
temporary
authority.
emergency
temperate
authority
according
to
the
regulations
is
to
be
granted
only
whether
is
an
enough
time
to
provide
notice
to
interested
parties,
and
then
it's
restrictive.
it's
restricted
to
30
days
and
then
it
can
be
continued
only
until
ordinary
temporary
authority
can
be
either
granted
or
denied.
now,
this
case
of
course
is
one
of
ordinary
temporary
authority,
and
the
regulations
that
begin
on
page
37
i
think
clearly
make
this
an
adversary
proceeding
before
the
commission
because
they
require
the
basic
elements
of
an
adversary
proceeding,
they
require
that
notice
be
given
to
interested
persons
in
the
federal
register
and
they
provide
interested
persons
who
are
willing
and
able
or
say
they
are,
to
provide
the
service
have
a
right
to
reply.
they
have
a
right
to
file
a
protest.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
page
37
of
--
mr.
justice
stewart
of
the
brief
of
certain
motor
carrier
appellees.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
now,
it's
a
truncated
proceeding
to
be
sure,
there
is
no
cross-examination
of
witnesses,
the
timetable
is
telescope,
but
it
is
nonetheless
and
adversary
proceedings.
now,
what
the
protestants
are
able
to
put
in
their
rebuttals
of
course
depends
in
large
measure
on
what
the
applicant
is
required
to
put
in
his
application,
and
associated
papers
and
that
brings
me
to
the
regulation
that
is
most
directly
involved
and
that
begins
on
page
34,
subparagraph
c
supporting
statements.
that
regulation
refers
to
the
supporting
statements
of
shippers
and
it
says
this
it
says
that
each
application
or
temporary
authority
must
be
accompanied
by
a
supporting
statement
or
statements
designed
to
established
an
immediate
and
urgent
need
for
service
which
cannot
be
met
by
existing
carriers,
the
statutory
standards.
and
then,
it
goes
on
say
that
any
self-supporting
statement
must
contain
at
least
the
following
information
and
it
sets
forth
11
categories
as
much
mr.
califano
has
indicated
and
of
those
were
concerned
here
basically
with
subparagraphs
7
and
8.
and
the
basic
question
is
whether
the
caputo
statement
compiled
with
the
requirements
of
7
and
8,
and
if
it
didn't,
what
the
consequence
is
ought
to
be?
7
and
8
go
to
what
a
shipper
is
suppose
to
say
is
to
whether
or
not
he
has
made
efforts
to
get
this
service
from
existing
carriers,
and
if
it
has
made
all
those
efforts,
he
is
then
suppose
to
give
the
names
and
the
dates
of
the
allegedly
defaulting
carriers
and
the
reasons
they
assigned
for
not
being
able
to
perform,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
now,
analysis
at
this
point
in
our
view
is
impaired
somewhat
by
the
fact
that
we
believe
that
the
appellants
have
taken
rather
markedly
diverging
views
of
what
the
department
of
defense
said
in
response
to
the
threshold
question
of
subparagraph
8.
now,
that
question
is
whether
efforts
have
been
made
to
obtain
the
service
from
existing
carriers.
american
farm
lines
says
clearly
in
its
brief
and
i
did
not
understand
mr.
califano
to
retreat
from
it
that
dod's
response
to
that
question
was
negative,
that
it
did
not
make
any
such
efforts.
the
argument
is
spelled
forth
at
some
length
on
pages
20,
i
think
20
to
23
of
their
opening
brief
and
their
conclusion
is
this
on
page
22.
in
short,
the
department's
response
to
the
requirements
of
subparagraphs
8
and
9
was
that
it
had
not
requested
the
proposed
service
from
other
carriers,
and
then
it
goes
on
to
explain
why
in
its
view
that
shouldn't
be
fatal,
and
i'll
take
that
up
in
a
moment.
but
now
let
me
turn
--
well,
and
then
its
analysis
proceeds
this
way
and
says
that
as
dod
said
it
did
not
may
be
his
efforts
then
course
the
other
requirements
of
8
and
9
never
came
into
play
because
the
department
couldn't
be
required
to
supply
details
as
to
efforts
that
it
never
made.
now,
the
solicitor
general
on
the
other
hand,
i
understand
not
to
advance
that
argument
but
rather
the
argument
that
indeed
dod
said
--
now,
this
isn't
the
question
i
should
make
clear
as
to
what
dod
actually
did.
this
is
a
question
as
to
what
dod
said
in
its
statement,
no
one
knows
really
what
dod
actually
did.
we
can
only
go
on
the
basis
of
what
it
said.
the
solicitor
general
as
i
read
its
brief,
of
course,
the
government
has
not
argued
this
aspect
of
the
case
so
we
have
to
rely
on
that
brief
i
think.
as
i
understand
their
brief,
they
say
that
the
solicitor
general
did
make
these
efforts
and
that
he
did
provide
--
i
mean,
dod
and
that
the
dod
did
provide
most
of
the
information
are
required
and
really
all
that
ought
to
be
required.
this
is
what
he
says
on
page
16
and
17
of
his
brief.
in
fact
the
statement
of
dod
that
is
did
provide
much
of
the
information
there
specified,
thus
dod
did
state
whether
it
made
efforts
to
obtain
the
service
from
existing
carriers
and
graphically
describe
the
results
of
its
efforts
as
subsection
8
dictates,
and
it
explained
in
detail
the
reasons
whey
existing
carriers
were
only
able
to
provide
the
service
needed
as
subsection
9
contemplates.
we
acknowledge
the
statement
did
not
give
the
dates
of
dod's
efforts
to
secure
service
as
8
further
asks,
or
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
carriers
who
do
not
provide
service
as
9
specifies.
but
these
are
the
only
deficiencies,
and
then
it
goes
on
to
explain
why
he
doesn't
consider
those
fatal
and
i'll
move
on
to
that
in
due
course.
now,
the
good
deal
in
terms
of
how
one
approaches
this
case
depends
upon
which
of
these
views
to
the
dod
statement
is
correct.
in
our
view
the
government
is
the
only
one
that
is
open,
and
that
is
because
the
commission,
mr.
justice
white,
does
have
what
i
consider
to
be
a
finding
of
sorts
here
in
its
order,
and
it
bears
directly
on
this
problem.

page
368
(a)
of
the
appendix.
now
this
--
and
i
am
referring
particularly
the
subparagraph
3,
but
i'll
incorporate
when
i
read
it
the
--
it
further
appearing
language
at
the
top
of
the
page.
the
commission
says
this
in
its
order,
yet
further
appearing
that
by
its
verified
statement
field
november
20,
1968,
the
department
of
defense
has
established
that
it
has
attempted
but
has
been
unable
to
obtain
the
required
and
necessary
type
of
service.
not
that
it
has
not
attempted
as
afl
indicated
and
that
quotation
that
i
read
from
it
brief.
so
the
number
well
established
doctrine
emerging
from
decisions
of
this
court
such
as
that
in
the
chenery
case
and
the
burlington
truck
lines
case,
we
suggest
that
the
order
of
the
commission
has
to
be
defended
upon
the
grounds
that
it
put
it
on.
and
therefore
that
this
argument
that
afl
advances
here
newly
devised,
advance
here
i
think
for
the
first
time
in
this
litigation
is
simply
not
open.but
i
would
like
to
say
that
there
are
additional
infirmities
in
it.
i'd
like
to
touch
on
those
for
a
moment.
because
of
course
normally
if
the
shipper
says
that
he
hasn't
made
any
efforts
to
get
the
service
that
he
wants
from
existing
carriers,
that
would
be
fatal.
not
because
of
noncompliance
with
the
regulations,
but
because
of
noncompliance
with
the
statute.
he
simply
would
not
have
made
this
sufficient
showing.
now,
afl
says
that
that
shouldn't
be
the
case
here
because
as
mr.
califano
said
what
dod
wanted
was
single-line
direct
route
service
and
it
knew
that
wasn't
available
from
existing
carriers
between
many
of
the
points,
and
therefore
it
would
have
been
bootless
for
them
as
for
it.
and
they
add
that
single-line
direct
route
service
is
obviously
superior
to
joint
line
service.
well,
i
think
they
summarize
your
position
quite
succinctly
in
the
reply
brief
back
on
page
13.
this
is
what
afl
says,
the
department
made
clear
that
it
support
for
afl
way
premise
not
upon
service
failures
but
upon
the
department's
desire
to
upgrade
the
quality
and
to
reduce
the
cost
of
the
motor
transportation
service
available
to
it
through
the
certification
of
direct
single-line
service.
now,
have
that
been
the
argument
made
by
dod
and
explicitly
to
the
commission,
we
suggest
that
the
commission
surely
would
have
concluded
or
surely
should
have
conclude
at
least
that
for
the
reasons
i've
already
indicated,
the
temporary
authority
statue
was
simply
not
designed
to
permit
the
short
circuiting
of
all
of
the
other
procedures
of
the
act
simply
in
order
to
upgrade
the
quality
and
reduce
the
cost
of
the
service
available.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that's
because
it's
not
urgent
and
immediate.
that's
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
now
so
far
as
cost
is
concerned,
the
commission
has
never
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no,
no
i
don't
mr.
justice
brennan.
certainly
in
the
order,
the
commission
never
suggested
that
it
was
considering
cost
savings
from
the
government,
and
indeed,
i
can
provide
the
court
citations
in
which
the
commission
has
said
that
even
in
permanent
authority
cases,
a
rate
question
is
not
irrelevant
factor.
now
of
course,
we're
talking
about
this
enormous
savings.
we're
not
talking
about
this
particular
case
either
in
the
american
farm
lines
having
single-line
direct
writ
authority.
it's
not
going
to
save
the
government
this
money,
monumental
sum
of
money.
but
if
every
carrier,
if
the
entire
certification
scheme
under
the
act
is
to
be
abandoned
now
and
every
carrier,
west
of
the
mississippi
is
to
have
direct
single-line
authority,
well
i
don't
doubt
that
there
would
be
very
considerable
savings.
i
don't
doubt
that
al
lot
of
carriers
would
go
on
to
business.
i
don't
doubt
that
the
commission
would
regard
this
all
as
a
very
complicated
and
difficult
question.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
excuse
me?
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
you
mean
the
pipe
line?
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know.
i
--
it's
a
--
perhaps,
i
can
respond
this
way.
if
the
defense
department
had
said
that
what
we're
talking
about
here
ammunitions
destined
for
vietnam
and
here
the
points
of
origin,
and
here
are
the
points
of
destination
nor
or
aircraft
parts
or
something
that
sort,
and
to
be
sure
we're
only
talking
in
terms
of
saving
a
day
or
saving
12
hours
from
east
to
west
or
something
of
that
sort
but
that's
very
important
because
fighting
men
are
depending
on
this
material.
well
i
mean,
i
would
never
suggest
that
that
would
be
irrelevant
consideration
in
a
highly
persuasive
consideration
under
the
temporary
authority.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no
sir,
mr.
justice
white
and
i
refer
here
to
the
regulation.
the
regulation
that
you
discussed
with
mr.
califano
--
mr.
cerra,
i
believe
was,
is
a
regulation
that
we
set
forth
quoted
in
full
in
at
pages
50
and
51
of
our
opening
brief.
now,
it's
never
been
mentioned
by
the
appellants
until
your
colloquy
with
mr.
cerra.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
regulation
says
pretty
clear
that
whatever
theoretical
advantages
may
be
thought
to
be
associated
with
single-line
service
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
or
practical,
if
you
can
that
way,
will
not
be
enough
in
a
temporary
authority
proceeding.
one
have
must
show
some
sort
of
unusual
and
significant
actual
default
in
the
part
of
the
existing
joint
line
carriers.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
not
at
all.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
shed
light
on
it,
but
i
think
what
there
is
in
the
record
only
makes
it
more
surprising
if
i
may
say
because
the
caputo
statement
after
all
was
not
written
in
the
dark.
it
was
submitted
to
the
commission
some
roughly
a
month
after
judge
boldt
in
the
hearing
on
the
temporary
restraining
order
identified
noncompliance
with
subparagraphs
8
and
9
as
a
serious
problem
in
his
mind.
so
that
what
one
would
reasonably
expect
would
be
that
the
defense
department
in
putting
in
another
statement
would
have
been
particularly
careful
to
comply
with
subparagraphs
8
and
9.
i
can
only
--
well,
i
shouldn't
assume
anything.
i
should
simply
answer
and
the
answer
to
the
question
i
think
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that
is
the
date
of
the
caputo
statement,
the
final
dod
statement.
the
hearing
on
the
temporary
restraining
order,
i
believe
was
in
october.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well,
the
november
20,
this
statement
that's
being
referred
to
here
is
the
only
dod
statement
that
is
being
spoken
up
in
any
respect
now.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well
as
to
finding
3
or
in
subparagraph
3,
i
assume
that
the
commission
thought
that
a
fair
inference
from
what
the
defense
department's
statements
said,
and
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
it
was
not
a
fair
inference.
now
our
complaint
of
course
is
that
having
said
that
they
did
attempt
to
get
the
service
they
wanted,
they
were
then
required
to
comply
with
the
other
parts
of
subparagraphs
8
and
9
and
provide
the
details.
so,
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes,
that's
right
and
let
me
move
directly
to
that.
i
just
--
on
the
single-line
authority
problem,
i
just
like
to
make
sure
i
made
one
final
point
on
it,
and
then
--
let
me
move
directly
into
that.
i
think
that
really
conclusive
evidence
that
the
commission
did
not
issue
this
authority
on
the
premise
advance
now
by
afl;
that
is
the
desirability
of
single-line
services,
the
fact
that
they
didn't
limit,
they
did
not
limit
it
to
those
points
between
which
various
exist
no
single-line
direct
service.
it's
simply
a
broad
14-state
geographical
ground.
so
far
as
the
extra
record
material
that
cited
in
afl's
reply
brief
is
concerned
with
respect
to
the
statements
made
by
some
appellees
about
the
desirability
of
single-line
service,
those
statements
were
made
in
the
context
of
applications
for
permanent
authority
and
for
reasons
that
i've
already
indicated
that's
much
different
than
an
application
for
temporary
authority.
but
i
would
cite
to
the
court
since
we
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
reply,
to
icc
examiner's
decisions
in
this
chain
of
litigation
going
on
before
the
commission.
ashworth
transfer,

and
derrick
freight
lines
inc.
m.c.

sub
number

november

1969.
in
both
of
these
cases,
the
examiner
in
permanent
authority
cases
denied
single-line
authority
direct
routes
sought
by
the
defense
department
upon
substantially
the
same
grounds
as
they
sought
this
authority
criticizing
the
defense
department
for
not
establishing
sufficiently
the
asserted
deficiencies
in
multiple
line
service.
now,
i
don't
say
that
this
is
terribly
important,
but
i
do
say
that's
--
it
is
indicative
of
the
kind
of
evidence
that
has
to
be
introduced
when
one
realize
on
the
single-line
authority
concept
even
in
a
permanent
authority
case.
now,
mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
go
into
this
question
of
what
it
is
that
we
complain
about
in
terms
of
the
government
side
which
i
understand
to
be
that
there
where
depots.
the
solicitor
general
says
that
yes,
the
caputo
statement
did
not
give
names,
dates,
particulars
about
the
service
deficiencies
about
which
it
was
complained,
but
he
says
that
shouldn't
matter
and
--
so
i
guess
really,
the
basic
question
is
whether
it
should
matter
or
not.
there
isn't
any
question
i
think
that
he's
right
in
making
the
concession
that
does
in
this
entire
dod
statement,
not
a
single,
not
a
single
existing
allegedly
defaulting
carrier
is
named.
no
dates,
no
names
and
no
particulars.
we
suggest
that
the
standard
to
be
used
in
measuring
whether
or
not
this
is
--
if
i
may
for
a
lack
of
a
better
word
say
prejudicial
error
ought
to
be
the
traditional
one
and
ought
to
be
whether
have
the
error
and
not
been
committed
might
the
outcome
have
been
changed.
the
government
says
that
it
would
not
have
been.
they
say
on
their
brief
that
the
provision
of
these
details
could
not
be
affected
the
outcome
and
i
understand
them
to
say
that
on
the
notion
that
the
evidence
of
record
was
compelled.
now,
that's
kind
of
a
harmless
error
doctrine.
it
seems
to
us
it
has
no
place
unless
the
evidence
that's
being
relied
upon
is
compelling
is
independent
of
the
error;
that
is
to
say
that
correction
of
the
error
would
not
have
affected
that
evidence.
now
if
you
got
20
eyewitnesses
to
a
crime
and
they
all
identified
the
defendant
in
a
trial
and
the
trial
judge
improperly
circumscribes
cross-examination
going
to
the
eyesight
and
one
of
them,
well
maybe
that's
harmless
error.
but
that
situation
does
not
resemble
the
one
at
bar
at
all
because
the
provision
of
the
details
by
dod
might
radically
have
undercut
the
force
of
its
submission.
now,
i
don't
have
the
time
in
oral
argument
for
the
kind
of
detailed
textual
analysis
of
this
statement
that
we
do
have
in
the
briefs,
but
let
me
illustrate
to
the
court
what
kind
of
thing
i
have
in
mind.
the
most
important
parts
of
the
statement
are
generalities.
they're
always
qualified
in
what
we
regard
as
suggestive
way.
now
for
example,
page
368
of
the
caputo
statement,
the
statement
--
no,
that‘s
not
a
statement,
that's
the
order.
the
statement
begins
on
194,
i
think,
yes.
page
198
contains
what
is
sort
the
topics
sentence
of
the
statement.
there,
mr.
caputo
says
this
defense
need
for
speed
has
not
been
met
in
many,
many
instances
by
the
current
certified
motor
carriers.
now,
no
place
in
this
statement
does
he
indicate
anything
about
those
many,
many
instances.
i
suppose
arithmetically,
that
could
50
or
100
or
a
150
or
almost
any
figure,
but
surely
it
would
make
a
difference
if
it
were
only
a
50
in
this
broad
geographical
area
among
these
dozens
of
carriers,
and
i
don't
really
see
how
it
reasonably
could
be
suggested
otherwise.
in
the
next
sentence
he
says
--
and
let
me
just
string
some
of
these
together
because
they're
all
really
the
same.
in
the
next
paragraph,
he
says
we
must
in
some
cases
allow
no
less
than
24
hours
for
each
300
miles
of
joint
line
service,
some
cases.
the
next
sentence
he
said,
prescribe
routes
are
often
circuitous.
in
the
next
paragraph
he
says,
some
regular
route
carriers
utilize
single
drivers
instead
of
two-men
driving
teams
and
this
sometimes
results
in
delays.
the
next
page
he
says,
some
shipments
of
explosives
between
mcallister
and
vanguard
transit
for
lengthy
periods
of
time.
and
it's
that
way
throughout.
in
many
instances,
it
is
necessary
to
closely
coordinate
the
arrival
of
inbound
shipments
with
production
schedules.
he
gives
one
example,
how
many
are
many
in
addition
to
one?
in
the
next
page
he
says
dod
has
experience
situations
where
shipments
routed
the
currently
certificated
carriers
failed
to
arrive
at
destination
in
time
for
transshipments
and
it
gives
one
example
there.
how
many
more
times
beyond
one
did
dod
actually
experienced
these
situations?
now,
he
does
provide
in
his
statements
some
what
he
calls
examples.
we've
analyzed
them
one
by
one
in
our
brief
and
i
won't
detain
the
court
with
the
flaws
that
we
see
in
the
examples
other
than
to
note
that
again
that
they
did
not
comply
with
the
regulations.
the
allegedly
defaulting
carriers
were
not
identified.
they
had
no
opportunity
of
rebuttal.
but
beyond
that,
i
suggest
that
the
fact
that
dod
did
provide
some
examples
cuts
in
our
favor
and
not
against
us
because
in
the
first
place,
it
shows
they
can
provide
examples.
and
in
the
second
place,
one
cannot
put
aside
the
possibility
mr.
chief
justice
that
this
is
about
all
they
could
come
up
with.
because
as
i
said
before,
they
grafted
the
statement
in
the
face
of
the
temporary
restraining
order
which
pointed
to
noncompliance
with
subparagraphs
8
and
9
as
a
problem.
they
went
back
and
they
drafted
it
and
i
think
it
is
at
least
reasonable,
it
is
reasonably
possible
to
assume
that
this
was
about
as
good
as
they
could
do.
but
if
that's
a
possibility,
then
surely
compliance
with
the
regulations,
compelling
the
department
to
deploy
with
the
regulations
might
entirely
have
change
the
outcome
of
this
case
because
if
this
handful
of
examples
is
all
that
the
department
could
come
up
with.
i
would
find
it
very
difficult
to
believe
that
the
commission
would
have
granted
this
temporary
authority.
and
i
have
not
spoken
of
the
possibility
of
rebuttal,
but
that
possibility
could
not
be
put
aside
either
as
this
record
demonstrates,
the
department
is
not
always
infallible
in
what
it
says.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
statement
of
the
munitions
carrier's
conference
which
is
here
some
place.
what
the
--
let
me
just
summarize
what
it
says,
what
it
says
--
here
it
is,
it's
on
page
308
and
309
and
what
it
says
basically
is
that,
that
dod
in
one
of
its
statements
gave
before
this
caputo
statement
gave
three
examples
of
what
are
deserted
and
were
deficiencies.
and
those
--
two
of
them
could
be
verified
in
terms
of
the
carriers
that
were
involved
and
those
carriers
put
in
rebuttals.
one
of
them
indeed
as
the
statement
says
submitted
photo
static
copies
of
documents
which
established
of
the
charge
was
false,
and
dod
did
not
repeat
any
of
those
in
the
caputo
statement.
so
that
the
opportunity
to
rebut
specific
data,
when
that's
specific
data
is
given
by
the
dod
is
important
to
the
appellees.
i
should
mention
estes
briefly
but
i
think
mr.
califano
really
has
given
me
my
basis
for
distinguishing
estes
it's
the
one
that
i
rely
on,
there
are
several
but
the
shippers
in
estes
as
mr.
califano
said
stated
very
explicitly
that
they
have
not
made
any
efforts
to
get
the
service
that
they
were
interested
in
from
other
carriers.
so
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no,
i
think
it
would
be
never
justified
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
oh,
right,
yes,
i
found
that
interesting
passage
in
this
letter
and
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
you
will
not
find
in
the
caputo
statement
a
repudiation
of
the
three
letters
that
dod
wrote
and
which
the
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that
they
--
well,
i
--
it's
not
illogical?
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
it's
not
internally
inconsistent.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes,
yes,
well
you
might
as
a
matter
of
fact.
i
mean
it's
possible.
all
that
i
can
say
is
that
when
you
can
--
i
think
you
can
visualize
a
company
in
extreme
financial
client
or
something
like
that
might
really
need
better
service.
but
it's
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
the
commission
having
set
forth
in
its
single-line
service
regulations
pretty
clearly
an
indication
of
this
isn't
the
case,
and
the
commission
after
all
does
know
what
the
statute
says
and
what
the
history
of
the
statute
was.
i
think
that
what
the
commission
must
have
done
here
was
to
accept
the
general
statements
made
by
dod
in
the
caputo
statement
in
terms
of
what
it
said
where
its
actual
service
failures
that
in
many,
many
instances
they
haven't
gotten
goods
on
time
for
transshipment
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
based
their
decision
base
on
the
order
on
that
and
not
upon
a
mere
statement
by
dod
of
a
preference
for
better
service.
now
if
in
this
order,
i
certainly
don't
suggest
that
this
order
is
a
model
of
clarity
far
from
it,
but
if
in
this
order
the
commission
had
said
which
you
just
suggested
mr.
justice
white,
then
the
litigation
that
seems
to
me
would
have
taken
an
entirely
different
path.
what
we
would
have
been
arguing
in
lower
court
was
that
the
order
did
not
comply
with
the
statute
and
with
that
kind
of
a
fine
thing
by
the
commission
we
would
have
tested
this
on
a
different
basis.
let
me
spend
what
remaining
time
i
have
on
the
second
issue
in
the
case,
the
question
respecting
the
commission's
reopening
of
the
record.
i
regret
that
i
do
not
have
more
time
for
this
because
it
is
an
important
issue
bearing
as
it
does
upon
the
commission's
relation
to
the
federal
judiciary.
but
we
have
set
forth
our
arguments
in
our
briefs
in
detail
and
of
course,
we
rely
upon
them.
let
me
try
simply
to
touch
upon
the
highlights
over
the
central
factors
of
these
issues.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
oh,
well,
i
think
clearly
the
applicant
has
the
burden
under
the
regulation
say
and
particularly
if
they're
talking
about
single-line
service
because
that
requires
in
terms
of
the
regulations
are
clearly
showing
that
the
existing
carriers
have
defaulted.
i
don't
think
really
that
commission
counsel
would
disagree
that
the
burden
here
is
on
the
applicant
especially
in
terms
of
the
concern
of
the
congress
expressed
in
the
committee
reports
that
this
temporary
authority
statute
be
utilized
only
in
a
emergencies
as
it
is
an
exception
to
the
general
statutory
scheme.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
exempt
from
the
--
from
which
provision
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no,
i
would
not
--
if
i
understand
the
question
right
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i
don't
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
and
certainly
they
done
it.
they
have
exempted
the
government
from
the
rate
discrimination
provisions
of
the
legislations
so
that
they
can
and
effect
that
the
rate
discrimination
in
favor
of
the
government.
they've
done
that,
but
they
haven't
done
anything
with
respect
to
the
routings
that
are
to
be
used
during
that
sort.
but
i
should
say
that
the
importance
of
government
traffic
to
the
regulated
motor
carrier
industry
in
particularly
to
some
elements
of
it
is
very,
very
great.
and
the
commission
will
one
way
or
another
in
the
many,
many
proceedings
that
are
pending
before
it
now
seeking
modification
of
routes
and
that
sort
of
thing
will
have
to
decide
how
this
problem
can
be
worked
out
so
as
to
provide
the
best
service
to
the
department
without
working,
undo
damage
on
the
existing
motor
and
rail
carriers.
i
think
that's
a
complex
problem,
and
so
i
would
much
prefer
to
see
that
worked
out
in
permanent
authority
applications
with
full
hearings
than
by
way
of
this
kind
of
summary
proceeding.
now,
i
would
gather
from
mr.
cerra's
argument
that
perhaps
erroneously
but
let
me
just
state
what
i
seem
to
feel
about
it,
and
that
is
that
if
these
petitions
for
reconsideration
have
not
been
pending
at
that
time
that
the
commission
reopened
the
record,
there
would
not
be
a
very
strenuous
argument
from
the
other
side
that
the
commission
was
free
to
do
what
it
did.
but
if
i
incorrectly
surmise
that
in
any
event,
i
think
that's
what
the
appellants
ought
to
be
conceding
because
inland
steel
in
the
--
this
court
in
establishing
that
the
commission
cannot
act
in
a
way
inconsistent
with
the
commission's
jurisdiction
taking
together
with
the
other
cases
that
we
have
cited
which
in
other
context
indicated
what
that
sort
of
thing
means.
it
seems
to
me
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
where
the
commission
in
effect
wipes
out
the
raise
of
the
litigation,
they're
acting
inconsistently
with
the
court's
jurisdiction,
and
that's
what
the
commission
did
here.
in
effect,
it
wiped
out
the
order
that
was
under
view.
it
reopened
the
record
in
effect
that
a
new
trial
and
entered
in
effect
a
new
judgment
which
was
then
subject
to
further
appeal.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
turning
question
here
is
the
effect
of
the
pending
petitions
for
reconsideration.
our
first
position
on
that
is
that
those
petitions
for
reconsideration
could
not
have
extended
the
authority
of
the
commission
because
they
were
not
authorized.
the
regulation
respecting
petitions
for
reconsiderations
in
temporary
authority
proceedings
is
set
forth
on
page
47
of
the
brief
of
certain
motor
carrier
appellees.
now,
it
identifies
two
kinds
of
orders
from
which
such
petitions
can
be
taken
and
this
case
does
not
involved
either
one
of
them
that
i
think
is
conceivable.
but
what
mr.
cerra
says
is
that
the
general
rules
of
practice
of
the
commission
do
authorize
a
petition
for
reconsideration
in
these
circumstances.
and
that
that
rule
should
be
ready
into
the
temporary
authority
rule
because
the
temporary
authority
rule
starts
out
pursuant
to
and
in
accordance
with
the
commission's
general
and
special
rules
of
practice.
now,
we
think
that
the
a
more
normal
reading
of
that
phrase
pursuant
to
and
in
accordance
with
would
be
to
refer
to
procedural
questions
such
as
a
number
of
copies
and
that
sort
of
thing.
but
more
important
than
that,
if
the
general
rules
and
the
special
rules
are
read
into
this
rule,
then
this
rule
is
robbed
of
any
independent
significance
because
the
petitions
for
reconsideration
that
are
authorize
by
this
rule
are
also
authorize
by
the
general
and
special
rules.
so
that
to
give
it
any
meaning,
one
must
read
it
restrictively.
one
must
conclude
that
this
rule
establishes
the
only
circumstances
under
which
petitions
for
reconsideration
are
to
be
permitted
in
temporary
authority
proceedings.
if
i
may
add
that
there
is
no
support
here
to
the
court
and
no
help
to
the
court
by
way
of
the
construction
of
these
regulations
by
the
commission.
the
commission
in
no
order
construed
these
regulations
to
permit
these
petitions
for
reconsideration.
it
reopened
the
proceeding
on
its
own
motion.
there
is
a
reference
in
a
footnote
and
afl's
brief
to
the
effect
that
that
is
not
so
and
that
the
commission
indicated
that
it
believed
the
petitions
were
authorized
but
i
refer
the
court
to
the
record
citation.
it
is
to
a
brief
by
commission
counsel
and
the
court
below.
but
beyond
that,
we
say
that
even
if
the
petitions
were
not
authorized
that
the
results
should
be
the
same.
and
we
say
that
fundamentally
because
we
think
if
the
result
is
different,
that
an
important
policy
consideration
underlying
the
principle
restricting
agency
freedom
in
the
context
of
judicial
review
would
be
undercut.
and
that
policy
we
think
arises
from
the
dual
role
of
the
agency.
it
is
of
course
first
and
foremost
the
neutral
arbiter,
but
then
when
its
orders
are
attacked
it
becomes
a
litigant.
now,
so
long
as
the
litigation
is
simply
conducted
by
the
general
counsel's
office,
there's
no
possibility
of
conflict
of
interest.
but
where
the
commission
reopens
the
procedure
after
judicial
review
has
commenced
and
particularly
where
the
court
has
identified
would
it
seize
as
a
possible
difficulty
in
the
commission's
position.
then
we
suggest
that
there
is
a
risk
that
the
agency
will
add
it
more
as
a
litigator
than
as
an
arbiter.
now,
the
counsel
for
the
commission
says
yes,
but
--
well,
he
doesn't
say
yes
to
that,
but
he
says
in
connection
with
this
point
that
one
must
allow
the
commission
the
right
to
correct
errors
and
certainly
that's
true,
and
that's
an
important
policy
consideration.
but
first
of
all,
the
rule
that
we're
arguing
for
it
doesn't
deny
the
agency
the
right
to
do
that.
it
simply
requires
that
the
agency
get
the
authority
of
the
court
to
do
whatever
it
wishes
to
do.
and
in
the
second
place,
the
facts
of
this
case,
well
certainly
not
conclusive
one
way
or
the
other,
do
not
fit
very
neatly
we
suggest
into
the
notion
that
what
the
commission
is
doing
here
was
correcting
error
in
that
alone.
the
government
in
a
footnote
to
its
brief
indicates
that
the
commission
had
in
mind
when
it
reopened
the
record,
this
problem
respecting
subparagraphs
8
and
9
of
the
regulations.
but
if
that
is
so,
you
didn't
do
anything
about
that
problem
at
least
directly.
it
did
not
suggest
to
the
department
if
they
comply
with
subparagraphs
8
and
9.
it
did
not
direct
the
attention
of
the
department
to
subparagraphs
8
and
9.
what
it
did
was
to
reopen
the
record
and
take
additional
evidence
from
the
department
and
then
its
counsel
returned
to
court
below
as
they
do
here
and
conceive
that
there
were
defaults
with
respect
to
the
compliance
with
these
regulations
as
judge
boldt
indicated
in
that
very
first
hearing,
but
argued
that
the
additional
evidence
that
was
taken
was
so
compelling
as
to
outweigh
these
problems
with
respect
to
the
regulation.
as
i
say,
i
don't
suggest
that
these
facts
are
conclusive
with
respect
to
this
risk
that
i'm
talking
about,
but
they're
not
inconsistent
at
least
with
the
theory
that
i
advance.
and
so
what
we
argue
for
and
i
may
say
it
seems
to
me
that
what's
needed
here
is
a
rule.
there
ought
to
be
a
clear
cut
rule.
i
don't
suggest
that
this
is
a
--
that
the
policy
consideration
is
either
way
here
are
so
strong
as
to
establish
that
we're
right
or
we're
wrong.
what
i
do
say
is
that
we
think
that
the
burden
on
the
commission
in
complying
with
the
rule
that
we're
talking
about
would
be
very,
very
slight
indeed.
whereas,
the
risk
of
danger
on
the
other
side
is
reasonably
significant
and
so
what
we
urge
is
a
rule
that
would
require
the
commission
when
should
this
review
is
commence
or
at
the
very
least,
after
the
court
has
taken
a
significant
step
in
the
case.
and
that
here
was
the
grant
of
the
temporary
restraining
order
after
a
full
hearing.
but
at
that
point,
the
commission
then
be
required
to
go
to
the
court,
seek
authorization
if
it
wishes
to
reopen
the
record
and
enter
a
new
order.
we
think
that
as
i
say,
that's
a
slight
burden
on
the
commission.
it
prevents
any
hazards
with
respect
to
the
legitimate
interest
of
the
parties
before
the
commission.
that
i
think
summarizes
our
case
if
it
please
the
court.
