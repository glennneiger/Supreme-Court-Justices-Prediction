mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
in
the
remaining
time,
allotted
to
appellants
except
for
the
few
minutes
we
hoped
to
say
for
rebuttal,
my
argument
will
be
addressed
to
the
second
question
presented
by
these
consolidated
appeals.
the
question
concerns
the
commissioner's
jurisdiction
to
reopen
its
administrative
proceedings
after
protesting
carriers
have
sought
judicial
review
before
a
three-judge
court
and
a
single-judge
of
the
court
had
issued
a
restraining
order.
now,
the
pertinent
facts
concerning
this
question
are
not
in
dispute,
but
i
think
they
are
important
and
we
would
highlight
them
to
bring
focus
on
the
issue.
after
the
commission
issued
its
first
order,
many
protesting
carriers
filed
petitions
for
reconsideration
and
some
sought
that
the
commission
stay
the
effect
of
its
grant
until
the
petitions
could
be
determined.
the
commission
denied
the
stay
and
the
grant
became
effective
immediately.
shortly
thereafter,
some
of
the
protesting
carriers
went
to
court
and
they
obtain
from
the
judge,
a
single
district
judge
a
temporary
restraining
order
against
the
operation
of
the
commission's
grant
of
authority.
upon
issuance
of
the
restraining
order,
the
commission
exceeded
to
it
and
itself
postponed
the
operation
of
its
initial
order.
now
in
reply
to
the
petitions
that
arrive
in
pending
before
the
commission,
the
department
of
defense
and
afl
made
specific
request
that
these
petitions
should
be
looked
at
because
number
one,
the
department
of
defense
had
add
it
in
its
reply
of
the
petition,
some
additional
reasons
supporting
a
grant.
afl
meanwhile
had
also
asked
that
the
petition
be
reopened
in
order
to
receive
this
evidence.
our
commission
of
course
had
a
problem.
this
addition
--
evidence
had
not
been
a
part
of
the
original
record,
nor
had
the
existing
carriers
been
offered
enough
and
extended
an
opportunity
to
reply
to
that
evidence.
so
on
the
5th
of
november,
it
decided
to
reopen
the
matter
and
it
reopened
it
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
the
additional
evidence
to
be
submitted
by
the
department
of
defense,
as
well
as
any
evidence
of
reply
by
the
existing
carriers.
we
immediately
notified
--
the
government
immediately
notified
the
court
of
this
reopening,
and
we
move
for
a
stay.
pending
final
completion
of
the
administrative
process,
we
specifically
stated
in
the
motion
that
it
was
our
intent
that
upon
completion
of
the
administrative
process,
the
parties
have
the
opportunity,
the
plaintiffs
that
is,
protesting
carriers,
have
the
opportunity
if
they
so
desire
to
renew
their
request
for
relief
from
the
court.
unfortunately,
the
motion
to
reply
has
never
came
on
for
hearing
under
local
rules
of
the
court.
but
after
receiving
the
additional
evidence,
the
commission
considered
the
record
anew,
both
as
previously
made
and
as
supplemented
by
the
additional
evidence
and
they
granted
the
temporary
authority
for
the
second
time.
the
protesting
carriers
immediately
file
a
complaint
in
court,
a
supplemental
complaint
attacking
the
second
grant
and
the
obtained
from
the
same
district
judge
a
temporary
restraining
order
against
that
grant's
operation.
on
final
review,
after
briefs
and
oral
argument,
the
three-judge
court
held
that
without
prior
leave
of
court,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
lack
jurisdiction
to
reopen
its
administrative
proceedings
after
the
court
have
assumed
jurisdiction
and
issued
the
first
temporary
restraining
relief.
in
this
connection,
the
court
also
held
that
there
was
nothing
validly
pending
before
the
commission.
they
said
that
the
commission
that
the
protesting
carrier's
petitions
for
reconsideration
were
not
authorized
by
temporary
authority
rule
6
or
by
general
rule
of
practice
101
(a)
(2).
with
this
holding,
the
court
concluded
that
there
was
nothing
properly
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
when
it
reopened
the
proceedings
leading
to
its
second
order.
now
taking
these
holdings
in
reverse
order,
we
submit
first
that
the
court
simply
misconstrued
the
commission's
rules
of
practice,
and
indeed
and
more
importantly,
they
overlooked
the
controlling
rule
of
practice
which
is
rule
101
(g).
now
generally
speaking,
the
commission's
general
rules
of
practice
prescribe
limitations
on
the
rights
of
parties
to
petition
for
reconsideration.
for
example,
rule
101
(a)
(2)
and
(3)
specified
that
all
orders
of
a
division
of
the
commission
shall
be
considered
administratively
final
except
in
two
instances
one
not
pertinent
here.
but
in
the
instance
that
is
pertinent
here
except
wherein
a
division
reverses,
changes,
or
modifies
a
prior
decision
of
a
hearing
officer.
the
court
below
had
held
that
temporary
authority
board
that
would
not
a
hearing
officer,
yet
the
very
rules
provide
that
the
term
officer
is
defined
as
including
a
board
of
employees.
so
properly
construe,
we
would
submit
that
rule
101
(a)
(2)
of
the
commissions
general
rule
of
practice
authorize
petitions
for
reconsideration
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
where
an
appellate
division
had
reversed
the
temporary
authorities
board,
but
we
need
not
however
to
rely
on
it.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
101
(a)
(2)
is
printed
in

at
page
--
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
it
is
not
in
our
brief.
it
is
in
the
--
i
regret,
your
honor
i
don't
know
where
it's
printed.
we're
relying
on
rule
101
(g)
which
appears
at
page
33
of
our
brief.
now,
i
was
getting
to
that
point.
even
considering
for
the
cause
indulgence,
i
do
have
a
copy
of
the
general
rules
of
practice
where
it
is
printed,
if
your
honor
would
like
to
look
at
it
mr.
justice
douglas.
i'd
be
glad
to
send
it
in
to
the
clerk
to
hand
up
to
you.
the
railroads
do
have
it
in
their
brief
that
footnote
13
on
page
18
but
here's
the
text
--
the
entire
rule
in
the
general
rules
of
practice.
as
i
was
saying,
we
need
not
to
rely
on
rule
101
(a)
(2)
however
because
the
construction
that
we
would
give
from
a
definition
of
the
term
hearings,
isn't
necessary.
rule
101
(g)
specifically
authorizes
the
filing
of
petitions
for
reconsideration
where
the
appellate
division
reverses,
changes,
or
modifies
a
previous
decision
by
a
board
of
employees.
faced
with
the
plain
language
of
this
rule
101
(g),
three
of
the
four
brief
of
the
appellees
don't
even
mention
it.
in
the
remaining
brief
filed
by
consolidated
freightways,
et
al.,
the
temporary
thought
they
contend
only
that
temporary
authority
rule
6
is
later
in
time
and
therefore
supersedes
or
restricts
the
vested
right
to
petition
for
reconsideration
which
is
granted
by
general
rule
101
(g).
but
we
submit
that
no
such
content
is
expressed
in
the
rule
6,
nor
can
one
be
so
implied.
indeed,
the
language
of
temporary
authority
rule
6
which
basically
says
that
petitions
for
reconsideration
of
the
determination
by
the
board
or
an
initial
determination
by
the
division
without
it
prior
determination
by
a
board
are
sudden
to
reconsideration
is
merely
a
repetition
of
the
general
rules
of
practice.
rule
6
itself
does
not
grant
the
right
to
petition
for
reconsider
or
rather
it
specifies
that
such
right
exist
and
i
quote
“pursuant
to
and
in
accordance
with
the
commission's
general
rules
of
practice,
the
rules
of
practice
of
the
governing
matter.”
it
would
seem
to
us
that
the
court's
construction
of
the
commissioner's
temporary
rule
and
general
rules
just
simply
inaccurate
and
incorrect.
they
were
validly
pending
before
the
commission,
petitions
for
reconsideration
under
rule
101
(g)
and
the
administrative
proceeding
had
not
been
completed.
well,
this
will
lead
me
to
the
discussion
of
the
remainder
of
the
court's
ruling.
that
is
that
simply
because
judicial
review
had
been
commenced
the
icc
lack
jurisdiction
to
reopen
or
hear
additional
evidence.
i
want
to
point
out
first
that
contrary
to
the
decision
below,
the
government
did
not
concede
that
the
commission's
initial
grant
of
authority
was
administratively
final,
rather,
we
urged
first
that
the
commission
proceeding
was
not
administratively
final
because
the
petitions
for
reconsideration
were
pending.
secondly,
we
urged
that
this
lack
of
administrative
finality
however
did
not
deprived
the
court
of
jurisdiction
to
issue
temporary
injunctive
relief
to
prevent
irreparably
injury
pending
final
agency
action
where
as
in
this
case,
the
order
have
already
been
become
effective
and
the
commission
had
to
disclaim
--
to
stay
its
operation.
now,
we've
cited
those
cases
in
our
brief
and
they
include
among
others,
oklahoma
natural
gas,
pacific
inland
tariff
bureau
and
cantley
and
(inaudible),
they
are
on
pages
24
and
45,
44
and
45
respectively
of
both
of
appellants
brief.
we
want
to
point
out
here
that
appellees
briefs
either
acknowledge,
refer
to,
or
attempt
to
explain
away
this
particular
rule.
now,
we
know
that
the
basic
tend
in
this
that
nobody
is
entitled
to
judicial
review
until
the
agency
all
administrator
remedies
have
been
exhausted
and
the
agency's
action
is
final.
the
one
that
we
attempted
to
use
here
was
an
exemption
which
was
stated
in
these
cases
we've
cite.
plaintiffs
don't
--
excuse
me,
i
referred
them
as
plaintiffs
because
of
my
experience
below,
the
appellees
here
don't
even
attempt
to
explain
them
away,
rather
they
urged
this
three
thing
that
once
a
court
asserts
jurisdiction,
the
commission
is
simply
without
anymore
authority
that
simply
does
not
posses
any
more
authority
to
proceed
further.
the
court's
jurisdiction
is
inclusive
--
exclusive
and
then
they
urge
that
there's
no
statute
that
authorizes
the
commission
to
act
concurrently
with
the
reviewing
court.
and
finally
the
third
matter
they
urge
is
that,
permitting
an
agency
to
reopen
after
court
review
has
been
commenced
disrupts
the
judicial
procedures
and
creates
the
danger
that
the
agency
may
not
be
acting
as
an
impartial
or
judicatory
tribunal,
but
rather
as
a
litigant,
merely
trying
to
paper
all
the
defects
in
an
attempt
to
win
a
lawsuit.
now,
we
would
submit
that
these
arguments
have
no
foundation
in
fact
or
in
law
simply
because
a
court
may
have
jurisdiction
to
preserve
a
status
quo
pending
completion
of
agency
action.
it
does
not
mean
that
the
commission
loses
all
jurisdictions
to
complete
the
administrative
process.
in
such
circumstances
we
would
submit
the
proper
procedure
is
for
the
reviewing
court
to
hold
the
judicial
action
in
advance
pending
completion
of
the
administrative
process.
the
caution
had
experienced
over
the
past
18
years
as
we
pointed
out
to
the
court
below
and
then
our
jurisdictions
statement
here.
with
this
very
situation,
most
of
the
cases
did
not
involve
--
were
temporary
restraining
order
have
been
initially
issued
by
the
judge
but
some
of
them
did.
and
no
court
has
ever
taken
issue
with
this
on
this
procedure
except
in
the
foot
--
except
in
the
cases
such
as
atchison,
topeka
which
is
cited
by
appellees
at
the
--
the
statutory
foundation
that
we
believe
for
the
ability
for
the
commission
to
reopen
while
a
judicial
review
proceeding
is
pending
is
section
17
(7)
of
the
act.
this
grants
the
commission
continuing
jurisdiction
over
its
orders
and
empowers
it
to
rehear,
reconsider,
resend,
change,
or
modify
them
anytime
for
the
purpose
of
correcting
errors;
any
error
or
any
injustice
that
is.
that
statute
has
been
in
existence
since
1906
and
it
hasn't
been
changed,
and
where
congress
has
sought
to
impose
a
limitation
on
the
rights
of
review,
for
other
agencies,
it
has
specifically
done
so.
it
is
said
that
once
the
reviewing
action
is
filed,
the
only
time
an
agency
can
reopen
is
up
until
the
point
whether
the
administrator
record
is
filed.
once
that
record
is
filed,
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
citations
we
give
in
our
brief,
court
of
appeals
jurisdiction
becomes
exclusive.
now,
congress
was
aware
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
practice
under
17
(6),
17
(7),
although
they
expressly
limited,
the
reopening
powers
of
other
agencies
such
as
the
federal
trade
commission.
so,
we
simply
say
that
were
congress
was
aware
of
this
situation,
it
was
careful
to
provide
some
limitation
against
reopening
where
it
considered
appropriate.
but
the
review
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
urgent
deficiency
act
which
applies
here,
which
both
of
which
apply
here,
i
submit
there
is
no
such
limitation
and
the
absence
of
such
provisions
is
therefore
meaningful.
but
more
importantly,
we
need
not
even
rely
on
section
17
(7).
as
we
have
shown,
the
case
was
validly
before
the
commission
because
the
petitions
for
reconsideration
were
pending.
and
we
would
submit
that
there
is
simply
no
inconsistency
between
the
commission's
reopening
and
issuing
a
second
order
on
new
evidence
on
the
one
hand,
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
court's
action
in
supplying
temporary
relief
from
operation
of
initial
grant
pending
completion
of
the
administrative
process.
we
informed
the
district
court
of
the
reopening.
there
was
no
attempted
evasion
or
any
evasion
at
all
of
the
court's
stay
of
the
first
order.
the
district
court
had
an
opportunity
to
stay
operation
of
the
second
order
and
in
fact
that
did
so.
we
failed
to
see
how
the
prejudice
--
how
the
appellees
could
have
been
prejudice
in
that
situation.
certainly,
they
have
ample
opportunity
before
the
commissioner
to
present
all
the
evidence
that
they
needed
to
present
to
rebut,
but
the
department
of
defense
had
submitted.
they
did
so.
they
also
have
ample
opportunity
to
go
back
before
the
reviewing
court
and
seek
relief,
and
they
did
so
and
they
obtained
it.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
yes,
your
honor,
they
do.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
that
is
the
rule,
point
four.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
generally
--
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
is
not
enough.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
no,
no.
they
say
this.
the
desire
of
a
shipper
for
single-line
service
in
lieu
of
existing
interchange
or
connecting
carrier
service
will
not
warrant
a
grant
of
temporary
authority.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
the
defense
department's
need
over
and
above
beyond
single-line
service
--
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
they
had
--
they
expressed
so.
in
their
--
in
mr.
caputo's
affidavit,
he
said
that
the
single-line
service
was
needed
to
complement
rather
than
replace
the
existing
joint
lines.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
it
is
here
your
honor
--
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
it
is
here
your
honor
because
this
rule
further
provides
that
a
grant
of
temporary
authority
to
effect
single-line
service
will
be
authorized
only
when
it
is
clearly
established,
and
there
are
two
test
that
the
carrier
providing
--
the
carriers
providing
multiple
line
service
are
not
capable
of
or
have
failed
in
meeting
the
reasonable
and
immediate
transportation
needs
of
the
shippers.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
mr.
--
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
they
wanted
a
single-line
service
for
the
various
savings
that
could
be
experience
in
both
time,
time-wise
and
money-wise.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
it
would
be
warrant.
it
would
be
enough
under
the
rule
--
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
your
honor,
we
would
say
that
you
would
have
to
show
what
the
deficiencies
were.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
but
the
question
of
only
interlining
is
that
were
talking
about
here,
your
honor,
vast
geographical
areas
and
commodities
and
for
the
--
for
an
applicant
to
come
before
the
commission
and
say
he
simply
desired
single-line
service
would
not
be
sufficient.
but
if
he
showed
that
there
was
an
immediate
and
an
emergent
need
for
it
and
that
there
were
no
carrier
service
capable
of
meeting
those
immediate
and
urgent
needs,
then
the
commission
would
be
authorized
on
the
rule,
balancing
the
equities
of
the
situation
and
the
evidence
of
determining.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
it
could
be
very
much
so
as
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
but
it's
not
in
spite
of
the
rule,
it's
because
of
the
rule,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
basic
reason
i'm
talking
here
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
to
reopen
while
this
court
case
is
pending
is
that
it's
a
basic
tentative
administrative
law
that
no
party
has
the
vested
right
to
have
an
agencies
error
preserved
pending
review.
if
the
agency
wishes
to
correct
that
error
without
the
necessity
of
reviewing
court,
remanding
the
matter
to
the
commission
for
this
purpose,
and
as
here
where
there
would
be
an
effective
judicial
review
of
the
corrective
action.
now,
they've
talked,
the
appellees
have
talked
about
the
point
of
perhaps
this
would
not
create
an
impartial
quasi-judicial
body
in
rendering
a
decision,
but
rather
that
the
commission
would
be
attempting
to
win
a
case
as
a
litigant.
we
submit
that
there's
absolutely
no
fact
in
that
suggestion.
the
commission's
primary
and
never
ending
role
is
to
administer
the
transportation
policy.
even
if
a
reviewing
court
had
remanded
the
commission
--
to
the
commission
an
order
which
had
put
out,
it's
still
would
be
responsible
as
this
court
has
said
on
many
occasions
to
administering
the
transportation
policy
by
either
reopening
the
matter
to
reconsider
it
on
the
existing
record,
reopening
to
receive
new
evidence
or
otherwise
disposing
of
it.
the
court
has
clearly
spelled
that
out
in
the
idaho
power
case
in
344
u.s.
there's
another
reason
though
we
think
that
this
procedure
should
be
sustained
here.
in
avoiding
the
delays,
inherent
the
court
reversals
in
remands,
the
commission's
action
is
consistent
with
the
broad
purpose
of
the
temporary
authority
provision
to
the
act
themselves.
that
is
the
question
of
immediacy.
it's
also
consistent
with
the
mandate
of
section
17
(3)
which
instructs
the
commission
to
conduct
its
proceedings
in
such
manner
as
best
full
conduce
to
the
ends
of
justice
and
the
proper
dispatch
of
business.
absent
any
statutory
prohibition
against
reopening
prejudice
to
the
parties
or
an
attempted
evasion
of
the
court
order,
the
commission
was
free
to
do
so.
and
finally,
we
submit
that
such
procedure
would
be
in
the
both
and
the
best
interest
of
judicial
economy
and
the
agency
responsibility.
we'd
like
very
much
to
save
our
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
in
the
remaining
time,
allotted
to
appellants
except
for
the
few
minutes
we
hoped
to
say
for
rebuttal,
my
argument
will
be
addressed
to
the
second
question
presented
by
these
consolidated
appeals.
the
question
concerns
the
commissioner's
jurisdiction
to
reopen
its
administrative
proceedings
after
protesting
carriers
have
sought
judicial
review
before
a
three-judge
court
and
a
single-judge
of
the
court
had
issued
a
restraining
order.
now,
the
pertinent
facts
concerning
this
question
are
not
in
dispute,
but
i
think
they
are
important
and
we
would
highlight
them
to
bring
focus
on
the
issue.
after
the
commission
issued
its
first
order,
many
protesting
carriers
filed
petitions
for
reconsideration
and
some
sought
that
the
commission
stay
the
effect
of
its
grant
until
the
petitions
could
be
determined.
the
commission
denied
the
stay
and
the
grant
became
effective
immediately.
shortly
thereafter,
some
of
the
protesting
carriers
went
to
court
and
they
obtain
from
the
judge,
a
single
district
judge
a
temporary
restraining
order
against
the
operation
of
the
commission's
grant
of
authority.
upon
issuance
of
the
restraining
order,
the
commission
exceeded
to
it
and
itself
postponed
the
operation
of
its
initial
order.
now
in
reply
to
the
petitions
that
arrive
in
pending
before
the
commission,
the
department
of
defense
and
afl
made
specific
request
that
these
petitions
should
be
looked
at
because
number
one,
the
department
of
defense
had
add
it
in
its
reply
of
the
petition,
some
additional
reasons
supporting
a
grant.
afl
meanwhile
had
also
asked
that
the
petition
be
reopened
in
order
to
receive
this
evidence.
our
commission
of
course
had
a
problem.
this
addition
--
evidence
had
not
been
a
part
of
the
original
record,
nor
had
the
existing
carriers
been
offered
enough
and
extended
an
opportunity
to
reply
to
that
evidence.
so
on
the
5th
of
november,
it
decided
to
reopen
the
matter
and
it
reopened
it
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
the
additional
evidence
to
be
submitted
by
the
department
of
defense,
as
well
as
any
evidence
of
reply
by
the
existing
carriers.
we
immediately
notified
--
the
government
immediately
notified
the
court
of
this
reopening,
and
we
move
for
a
stay.
pending
final
completion
of
the
administrative
process,
we
specifically
stated
in
the
motion
that
it
was
our
intent
that
upon
completion
of
the
administrative
process,
the
parties
have
the
opportunity,
the
plaintiffs
that
is,
protesting
carriers,
have
the
opportunity
if
they
so
desire
to
renew
their
request
for
relief
from
the
court.
unfortunately,
the
motion
to
reply
has
never
came
on
for
hearing
under
local
rules
of
the
court.
but
after
receiving
the
additional
evidence,
the
commission
considered
the
record
anew,
both
as
previously
made
and
as
supplemented
by
the
additional
evidence
and
they
granted
the
temporary
authority
for
the
second
time.
the
protesting
carriers
immediately
file
a
complaint
in
court,
a
supplemental
complaint
attacking
the
second
grant
and
the
obtained
from
the
same
district
judge
a
temporary
restraining
order
against
that
grant's
operation.
on
final
review,
after
briefs
and
oral
argument,
the
three-judge
court
held
that
without
prior
leave
of
court,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
lack
jurisdiction
to
reopen
its
administrative
proceedings
after
the
court
have
assumed
jurisdiction
and
issued
the
first
temporary
restraining
relief.
in
this
connection,
the
court
also
held
that
there
was
nothing
validly
pending
before
the
commission.
they
said
that
the
commission
that
the
protesting
carrier's
petitions
for
reconsideration
were
not
authorized
by
temporary
authority
rule
6
or
by
general
rule
of
practice
101
(a)
(2).
with
this
holding,
the
court
concluded
that
there
was
nothing
properly
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
when
it
reopened
the
proceedings
leading
to
its
second
order.
now
taking
these
holdings
in
reverse
order,
we
submit
first
that
the
court
simply
misconstrued
the
commission's
rules
of
practice,
and
indeed
and
more
importantly,
they
overlooked
the
controlling
rule
of
practice
which
is
rule
101
(g).
now
generally
speaking,
the
commission's
general
rules
of
practice
prescribe
limitations
on
the
rights
of
parties
to
petition
for
reconsideration.
for
example,
rule
101
(a)
(2)
and
(3)
specified
that
all
orders
of
a
division
of
the
commission
shall
be
considered
administratively
final
except
in
two
instances
one
not
pertinent
here.
but
in
the
instance
that
is
pertinent
here
except
wherein
a
division
reverses,
changes,
or
modifies
a
prior
decision
of
a
hearing
officer.
the
court
below
had
held
that
temporary
authority
board
that
would
not
a
hearing
officer,
yet
the
very
rules
provide
that
the
term
officer
is
defined
as
including
a
board
of
employees.
so
properly
construe,
we
would
submit
that
rule
101
(a)
(2)
of
the
commissions
general
rule
of
practice
authorize
petitions
for
reconsideration
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
where
an
appellate
division
had
reversed
the
temporary
authorities
board,
but
we
need
not
however
to
rely
on
it.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra

(a)

it

i

we're
relying
on
rule
101
(g)
which
appears
at
page
33
of
our
brief.
now,
i
was
getting
to
that
point.
even
considering
for
the
cause
indulgence,
i
do
have
a
copy
of
the
general
rules
of

where
it
is
printed,
if
your
honor
would
like
to
look
at
it
mr.

douglas.
i'd
be
glad
to
send
it

to
hand
up
to
you.
the
railroads
do
have
it
in
their
brief
that
footnote
13
on
page
18
but
here's
the
text
--
the
entire
rule
in
the
general
rules
of
practice.
as
i
was
saying,
we
need
not
to
rely
on
rule
101
(a)
(2)
however
because
the
construction
that
we
would
give
from
a
definition
of
the
term
hearings,
isn't
necessary.
rule
101
(g)
specifically
authorizes
the
filing
of
petitions
for
reconsideration
where
the
appellate
division
reverses,
changes,
or
modifies
a
previous
decision
by
a
board
of
employees.
faced
with
the
plain
language
of
this
rule
101
(g),
three
of
the
four
brief
of
the
appellees
don't
even
mention
it.
in
the
remaining
brief
filed
by
consolidated
freightways,
et
al.,
the
temporary
thought
they
contend
only
that
temporary
authority
rule
6
is
later
in
time
and
therefore
supersedes
or
restricts
the
vested
right
to
petition
for
reconsideration
which
is
granted
by
general
rule
101
(g).
but
we
submit
that
no
such
content
is
expressed
in
the
rule
6,
nor
can
one
be
so
implied.
indeed,
the
language
of
temporary
authority
rule
6
which
basically
says
that
petitions
for
reconsideration
of
the
determination
by
the
board
or
an
initial
determination
by
the
division
without
it
prior
determination
by
a
board
are
sudden
to
reconsideration
is
merely
a
repetition
of
the
general
rules
of
practice.
rule
6
itself
does
not
grant
the
right
to
petition
for
reconsider
or
rather
it
specifies
that
such
right
exist
and
i
quote
“pursuant
to
and
in
accordance
with
the
commission's
general
rules
of
practice,
the
rules
of
practice
of
the
governing
matter.”
it
would
seem
to
us
that
the
court's
construction
of
the
commissioner's
temporary
rule
and
general
rules
just
simply
inaccurate
and
incorrect.
they
were
validly
pending
before
the
commission,
petitions
for
reconsideration
under
rule
101
(g)
and
the
administrative
proceeding
had
not
been
completed.
well,
this
will
lead
me
to
the
discussion
of
the
remainder
of
the
court's
ruling.
that
is
that
simply
because
judicial
review
had
been
commenced
the
icc
lack
jurisdiction
to
reopen
or
hear
additional
evidence.
i
want
to
point
out
first
that
contrary
to
the
decision
below,
the
government
did
not
concede
that
the
commission's
initial
grant
of
authority
was
administratively
final,
rather,
we
urged
first
that
the
commission
proceeding
was
not
administratively
final
because
the
petitions
for
reconsideration
were
pending.
secondly,
we
urged
that
this
lack
of
administrative
finality
however
did
not
deprived
the
court
of
jurisdiction
to
issue
temporary
injunctive
relief
to
prevent
irreparably
injury
pending
final
agency
action
where
as
in
this
case,
the
order
have
already
been
become
effective
and
the
commission
had
to
disclaim
--
to
stay
its
operation.
now,
we've
cited
those
cases
in
our
brief
and
they
include
among
others,
oklahoma
natural
gas,
pacific
inland
tariff
bureau
and
cantley
and
(inaudible),
they
are
on
pages
24
and
45,
44
and
45
respectively
of
both
of
appellants
brief.
we
want
to
point
out
here
that
appellees
briefs
either
acknowledge,
refer
to,
or
attempt
to
explain
away
this
particular
rule.
now,
we
know
that
the
basic
tend
in
this
that
nobody
is
entitled
to
judicial
review
until
the
agency
all
administrator
remedies
have
been
exhausted
and
the
agency's
action
is
final.
the
one
that
we
attempted
to
use
here
was
an
exemption
which
was
stated
in
these
cases
we've
cite.
plaintiffs
don't
--
excuse
me,
i
referred
them
as
plaintiffs
because
of
my
experience
below,
the
appellees
here
don't
even
attempt
to
explain
them
away,
rather
they
urged
this
three
thing
that
once
a
court
asserts
jurisdiction,
the
commission
is
simply
without
anymore
authority
that
simply
does
not
posses
any
more
authority
to
proceed
further.
the
court's
jurisdiction
is
inclusive
--
exclusive
and
then
they
urge
that
there's
no
statute
that
authorizes
the
commission
to
act
concurrently
with
the
reviewing
court.
and
finally
the
third
matter
they
urge
is
that,
permitting
an
agency
to
reopen
after
court
review
has
been
commenced
disrupts
the
judicial
procedures
and
creates
the
danger
that
the
agency
may
not
be
acting
as
an
impartial
or
judicatory
tribunal,
but
rather
as
a
litigant,
merely
trying
to
paper
all
the
defects
in
an
attempt
to
win
a
lawsuit.
now,
we
would
submit
that
these
arguments
have
no
foundation
in
fact
or
in
law
simply
because
a
court
may
have
jurisdiction
to
preserve
a
status
quo
pending
completion
of
agency
action.
it
does
not
mean
that
the
commission
loses
all
jurisdictions
to
complete
the
administrative
process.
in
such
circumstances
we
would
submit
the
proper
procedure
is
for
the
reviewing
court
to
hold
the
judicial
action
in
advance
pending
completion
of
the
administrative
process.
the
caution
had
experienced
over
the
past
18
years
as
we
pointed
out
to
the
court
below
and
then
our
jurisdictions
statement
here.
with
this
very
situation,
most
of
the
cases
did
not
involve
--
were
temporary
restraining
order
have
been
initially
issued
by
the
judge
but
some
of
them
did.
and
no
court
has
ever
taken
issue
with
this
on
this
procedure
except
in
the
foot
--
except
in
the
cases
such
as
atchison,
topeka
which
is
cited
by
appellees
at
the
--
the
statutory
foundation
that
we
believe
for
the
ability
for
the
commission
to
reopen
while
a
judicial
review
proceeding
is
pending
is
section
17
(7)
of
the
act.
this
grants
the
commission
continuing
jurisdiction
over
its
orders
and
empowers
it
to
rehear,
reconsider,
resend,
change,
or
modify
them
anytime
for
the
purpose
of
correcting
errors;
any
error
or
any
injustice
that
is.
that
statute
has
been
in
existence
since
1906
and
it
hasn't
been
changed,
and
where
congress
has
sought
to
impose
a
limitation
on
the
rights
of
review,
for
other
agencies,
it
has
specifically
done
so.
it
is
said
that
once
the
reviewing
action
is
filed,
the
only
time
an
agency
can
reopen
is
up
until
the
point
whether
the
administrator
record
is
filed.
once
that
record
is
filed,
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
citations
we
give
in
our
brief,
court
of
appeals
jurisdiction
becomes
exclusive.
now,
congress
was
aware
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
practice
under
17
(6),
17
(7),
although
they
expressly
limited,
the
reopening
powers
of
other
agencies
such
as
the
federal
trade
commission.
so,
we
simply
say
that
were
congress
was
aware
of
this
situation,
it
was
careful
to
provide
some
limitation
against
reopening
where
it
considered
appropriate.
but
the
review
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
urgent
deficiency
act
which
applies
here,
which
both
of
which
apply
here,
i
submit
there
is
no
such
limitation
and
the
absence
of
such
provisions
is
therefore
meaningful.
but
more
importantly,
we
need
not
even
rely
on
section
17
(7).
as
we
have
shown,
the
case
was
validly
before
the
commission
because
the
petitions
for
reconsideration
were
pending.
and
we
would
submit
that
there
is
simply
no
inconsistency
between
the
commission's
reopening
and
issuing
a
second
order
on
new
evidence
on
the
one
hand,
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
court's
action
in
supplying
temporary
relief
from
operation
of
initial
grant
pending
completion
of
the
administrative
process.
we
informed
the
district
court
of
the
reopening.
there
was
no
attempted
evasion
or
any
evasion
at
all
of
the
court's
stay
of
the
first
order.
the
district
court
had
an
opportunity
to
stay
operation
of
the
second
order
and
in
fact
that
did
so.
we
failed
to
see
how
the
prejudice
--
how
the
appellees
could
have
been
prejudice
in
that
situation.
certainly,
they
have
ample
opportunity
before
the
commissioner
to
present
all
the
evidence
that
they
needed
to
present
to
rebut,
but
the
department
of
defense
had
submitted.
they
did
so.
they
also
have
ample
opportunity
to
go
back
before
the
reviewing
court
and
seek
relief,
and
they
did
so
and
they
obtained
it.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
yes,
your
honor,
they
do.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
that
is
the
rule,
point
four.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
generally
--
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
is
not
enough.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
no,
no.
they
say
this.
the
desire
of
a
shipper
for
single-line
service
in
lieu
of
existing
interchange
or
connecting
carrier
service
will
not
warrant
a
grant
of
temporary
authority.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
the
defense
department's
need
over
and
above
beyond
single-line
service
--
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
they
had
--
they
expressed
so.
in
their
--
in
mr.
caputo's
affidavit,
he
said
that
the
single-line
service
was
needed
to
complement
rather
than
replace
the
existing
joint
lines.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
it
is
here
your
honor
--
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
it
is
here
your
honor
because
this
rule
further
provides
that
a
grant
of
temporary
authority
to
effect
single-line
service
will
be
authorized
only
when
it
is
clearly
established,
and
there
are
two
test
that
the
carrier
providing
--
the
carriers
providing
multiple
line
service
are
not
capable
of
or
have
failed
in
meeting
the
reasonable
and
immediate
transportation
needs
of
the
shippers.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
mr.
--
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
they
wanted
a
single-line
service
for
the
various
savings
that
could
be
experience
in
both
time,
time-wise
and
money-wise.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
it
would
be
warrant.
it
would
be
enough
under
the
rule
--
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
your
honor,
we
would
say
that
you
would
have
to
show
what
the
deficiencies
were.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
but
the
question
of
only
interlining
is
that
were
talking
about
here,
your
honor,
vast
geographical
areas
and
commodities
and
for
the
--
for
an
applicant
to
come
before
the
commission
and
say
he
simply
desired
single-line
service
would
not
be
sufficient.
but
if
he
showed
that
there
was
an
immediate
and
an
emergent
need
for
it
and
that
there
were
no
carrier
service
capable
of
meeting
those
immediate
and
urgent
needs,
then
the
commission
would
be
authorized
on
the
rule,
balancing
the
equities
of
the
situation
and
the
evidence
of
determining.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
it
could
be
very
much
so
as
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
but
it's
not
in
spite
of
the
rule,
it's
because
of
the
rule,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
basic
reason
i'm
talking
here
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
to
reopen
while
this
court
case
is
pending
is
that
it's
a
basic
tentative
administrative
law
that
no
party
has
the
vested
right
to
have
an
agencies
error
preserved
pending
review.
if
the
agency
wishes
to
correct
that
error
without
the
necessity
of
reviewing
court,
remanding
the
matter
to
the
commission
for
this
purpose,
and
as
here
where
there
would
be
an
effective
judicial
review
of
the
corrective
action.
now,
they've
talked,
the
appellees
have
talked
about
the
point
of
perhaps
this
would
not
create
an
impartial
quasi-judicial
body
in
rendering
a
decision,
but
rather
that
the
commission
would
be
attempting
to
win
a
case
as
a
litigant.
we
submit
that
there's
absolutely
no
fact
in
that
suggestion.
the
commission's
primary
and
never
ending
role
is
to
administer
the
transportation
policy.
even
if
a
reviewing
court
had
remanded
the
commission
--
to
the
commission
an
order
which
had
put
out,
it's
still
would
be
responsible
as
this
court
has
said
on
many
occasions
to
administering
the
transportation
policy
by
either
reopening
the
matter
to
reconsider
it
on
the
existing
record,
reopening
to
receive
new
evidence
or
otherwise
disposing
of
it.
the
court
has
clearly
spelled
that
out
in
the
idaho
power
case
in
344
u.s.
there's
another
reason
though
we
think
that
this
procedure
should
be
sustained
here.
in
avoiding
the
delays,
inherent
the
court
reversals
in
remands,
the
commission's
action
is
consistent
with
the
broad
purpose
of
the
temporary
authority
provision
to
the
act
themselves.
that
is
the
question
of
immediacy.
it's
also
consistent
with
the
mandate
of
section
17
(3)
which
instructs
the
commission
to
conduct
its
proceedings
in
such
manner
as
best
full
conduce
to
the
ends
of
justice
and
the
proper
dispatch
of
business.
absent
any
statutory
prohibition
against
reopening
prejudice
to
the
parties
or
an
attempted
evasion
of
the
court
order,
the
commission
was
free
to
do
so.
and
finally,
we
submit
that
such
procedure
would
be
in
the
both
and
the
best
interest
of
judicial
economy
and
the
agency
responsibility.
we'd
like
very
much
to
save
our
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
