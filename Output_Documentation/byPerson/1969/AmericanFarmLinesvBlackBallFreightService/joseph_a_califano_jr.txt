mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
consolidated
appeals
are
taken
from
a
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
washington.
that
decision
nullified
a
grant
of
temporary
motor
carrier
authority
to
my
client,
american
farm
lines.
the
appeals
present
two
questions
concerning
interstate
commerce
commission's
award
of
temporary
motor
carrier
authority.
one
relates
to
the
adequacy
of
the
evidence
to
support
the
grant
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
icc
rules.
the
other
relates
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
icc
to
reopen
a
proceeding
handing
before
it
at
a
time
when
some
of
the
parties
had
obtained
preliminary
judicial
relief
against
the
commission
and
others
have
asked
the
commission
to
reconsider
its
opinion.
appellants
have
divided
the
allotted
time
for
argument.
i
will
state
the
facts
and
deal
with
the
first
issue.
mr.
cerra
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
government
will
discuss
the
second
issue.
we
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
the
conflict
before
this
court
arises
because
of
the
determination
of
the
defense
department
to
reduce
the
time
during
which
defense
material
is
in
transit
and
does
achieve
substantial
savings,
increased
deficiency
and
with
respect
to
explosives
and
other
dangerous
cargo,
increase
safety.
until
1966,
virtually
all
defense
motor
carrier
shipments
were
on
a
joint
line
basis
by
regulated
carriers
with
routing
specified
in
detail
and
their
certificates
of
operating
authority.
the
routings
were
generally
circuitous.
they
required
several
carriers
to
transport
the
same
load
of
defense
material.
in
1966,
the
department
began
to
use
exempt
farm
cooperatives
including
american
farm
lines
to
provide
a
fast,
direct,
point-to-point
service.
the
department
use
farm
cooperatives
because
a
legislative
exemption
freed
them
from
the
certificate
restrictions
of
regulated
carriers
and
thus
enable
them
to
provide
the
direct
single-line
service.
under
this
exemption,
american
farm
lines
has
hold
substantial
amounts
of
defense
material.
its
operations
promptly
demonstrated
three
advantages
to
the
department
of
direct
service.
the
direct
savings
from
lower
direct
transportation
costs,
the
indirect
savings
from
lower
inventories
enhanced
fewer
pipe
line
costs,
and
increase
safety
in
the
movement
of
explosives
and
dangerous
materials
because
of
a
shorter
period,
a
population
exposure.
in
1968
after
two
years,
roughly
two
years
of
operation
by
american
farm
lines,
two
actions
sharply
restricted
its
ability
to
provide
this
service.
the
first
was
an
injunction
obtained
by
the
munitions
carriers
conference,
and
the
second
was
a
change
in
the
legislative
exemption
for
farm
cooperatives.
as
a
result
of
the
eminent
curtailment
of
american
farm
line
service,
american
farm
lines
supported
by
the
defense
department
applied
to
the
icc
for
temporary
authority
to
continue
its
direct
single-line
service
as
a
regulated
carrier.
protests
were
filed
by
125
proposing
carriers.
the
application
of
american
farm
lines
was
made
under
section
210a
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
that
section
authorizes
the
commission
in
its
discretion
and
without
hearings
or
other
proceedings
to
grant
such
authority
and
i
quote,
“to
enable
a
provision
of
service
for
which
there
is
an
immediate
and
urgent
need
to
a
point
who
appoints
within
a
territory
having
no
service
capable
of
needing
that
need.”
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
the
duration
of
that
authority
was
180
days
has
been
extended
the
permanent
authority
proceedings
with
the
defense
department
support.
the
hearings
have
been
completed
and
the
case
now
being
briefed
before
the
icc.
icc
regulations
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
under
decisions
of
this
court
until
the
permanent
authority
case
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
--
is
granted.
the
icc
as
i
indicated
granted
american
farm
lines
the
authority
requested.
60
protestants
of
that
point
file
petitions
for
reconsideration.
some
of
them
moved
that
the
icc
stay
its
grant
of
temporary
authority
pending
resolution
of
the
petitions
for
reconsideration.
the
icc
denied
that
motion
and
several
of
the
protestants
then
went
to
the
western
district
court
and
ask
for
a
temporary
restraining
order.
that
temporary
restraining
order
was
granted.
no
further
action
was
taken
by
the
court.
the
icc
then
reopened
its
proceedings
to
receive
additional
evidence
from
the
defense
department,
american
farm
lines,
and
the
protestants.
the
icc
promptly
notified
the
court
of
its
action
and
move
for
a
stay
of
the
courts
full
review
of
the
proceedings.
the
court,
the
western
district
court
took
no
action
on
the
commission's
motion.
in
the
reopen
proceeding,
the
defense
department
filed
a
22-page
detailed
statement
supporting
american
farm
lines.
the
statement
was
filed
by
the
director
of
transportation
policy
for
the
defense
department,
the
highest
ranking
transportation
official
in
the
department.
protestants
filed
hundreds
of
pages
of
detailed
replies
to
the
defense
statement
and
upon
reviewing
all
the
additional
evidence,
the
icc
again
granted
temporary
authority
to
american
farm
lines.
the
commission
concluded
that
the
defense
department
had
an
immediate
and
urgent
need
for
american
farm
line
services
to
discharge
its
responsibilities
for
the
national
defense.
specifically,
the
icc
found
among
the
other
things
that
the
defense
department
“imperatively
requires
service
over
the
most
direct
routes
in
a
minimum
transit
time.”
the
department
knows
of
no
carriers
in
a
position
to
meet
its
needs
and
“there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
establish
that
the
protesting
carriers
provide
a
service
to
meet
its
need.”
the
protestants
returned
to
the
district
court
and
obtain
to
stay
of
the
icc
order.
on
final
review,
the
three-judge
court
vacated
the
grant
of
temporary
authority
by
the
icc.
it
based
its
decision
on
two
grounds
essentially
that
the
department
of
defense
statement
did
not
meet
two
requirements
of
an
icc
rule
with
respect
to
supporting
shipper
statements,
and
secondly
that
the
icc
was
without
jurisdiction
to
reopen
its
proceedings
and
accept
additional
evidence.
on
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
the
fact
that
the
appellees
here
had
gone
to
the
court
to
obtain
what
we
considered
to
be
an
essentially
interlocutory
relief.
the
--
on
august
21,
1969,
mr.
justice
douglas
granted
a
stay
of
the
three-judge
court
decision
to
avoid
irreparable
injury
to
american
farm
lines,
pending
the
resolution
of
this
case
before
this
court.
the
first
issue
is
whether
the
evidence
adduced
by
the
defense
department
as
the
supporting
shipper
reasonably
complied
with
the
procedural
rules
of
the
icc.
the
icc
rules
call
upon
shippers
to
provide
11
categories
of
information
and
the
court
below
raised
no
question
about
nine
categories
of
the
information
provided
by
the
defense
department.
it
questioned
the
department's
responds
to
two
of
these
categories.
one
was
and
i
quote
“whether
efforts
have
been
made
to
obtain
the
service
from
existing
motor
rail
or
water
carriers,
and
the
dates
and
results
of
such
efforts.”
and
the
other
is
“names
and
addresses
of
existing
carriers
who
have
either
failed
or
refused
to
provide
the
service
and
the
reasons
given
for
any
such
failure
or
refusal.”
without
considering
the
record
as
a
whole,
route
considering
whether
the
record
as
a
whole
contained
evidence
to
support
the
icc
as
grant
of
temporary
authority,
the
district
court
nullified
the
commission's
order
on
the
ground
that
the
defense
department
did
not
comply
literarily
with
the
requirements
of
these
two
categories.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
if
under
a
case
that
we
believe
to
be
almost
directly
in
point,
estes
v.the
united
states
which
this
court
decided
recently,
if
the
answer
had
been
no
to
the
first
question,
there
would
been
no
requirement,
you
know,
where
efforts
made,
no
efforts
were
made.
there
would
have
been
no
requirement
to
fulfill
any
of
the
other
requirements,
and
that
also
an
effect
of
being
fairly
say
conceded
in
the
appellees'
brief.
in
the
estes
case,
the
railway
express
agency
applied
for
temporary
authority
after
a
railroad
had
announced
that
is
was
canceling
service
between
washington
and
richmond.
the
railway
express
agency
indicated
that
it
had
not
tried
to
get
that
service
from
anyone
else
because
it
was
simply
not
available.
when
the
protesting
shippers
came
in,
none
of
them
held
themselves
out
publicly
as
capable
of
providing
a
direct
service
from
richmond
to
washington,
the
conroe
(ph)
express,
and
the
lower
court
and
this
court,
the
lower
court
held
that
railway
express
was
entitled
to
the
temporary
authority
and
this
court
affirmed
that
decision
per
curium.
we
believe
that
a
careful
reading
of
the
defense
statement
against
the
categories
i've
mentioned
shows
that
the
direct
single-line
service
of
american
farm
lines
was
unique,
that
the
protesting
certificated
carriers
were
incapable
legally
of
furnishing
this
service.
and
that
the
defense
department
aware
of
this
was
not
required
to
make
efforts
in
a
conventional
sense
to
obtain
single-line
service
from
protesting
carriers
who
had
no
authority
to
furnish
it.
both
of
those
categories
you
will
note
are
concerned
only
with
one
of
the
salutatory
standards
whether
the
existing
carriers
are
capable
of
providing
the
service
involved.
the
other
standard,
the
immediacy
and
urgency
of
the
shippers
need
for
that
service
is
not
involved
in
these
two
categories.
moreover,
it's
important
to
note
that
the
icc
rules
in
of
temporary
authority
proceeding
require
only
one
thing
from
the
protesting
carrier
that
he
give
a
specific
statement
“as
to
the
service
which
such
protestant
can
and
will
offer.”
in
evaluating
the
shipper's
response
to
these
categories,
the
first
question
is
what
the
service
was?
the
service
in
this
case
was
direct
single
lines
service
covering
a
14-state
area.
in
its
verified
statement,
the
defense
department
concluded
that
this
service
was
substantially
faster
than
joint
line
regular
route
service
and
many
cases
three
times
as
fast.
the
department
believed
that
this
service
was
materially
different
from
joint
line
regular
route
service
because
of
the
direct
savings
in
transportation
costs
and
because
of
the
enormous
impact
in
indirect
savings
on
its
inventory
pipe
line.
the
next
question
in
terms
of
these
categories
is
whether
this
certificate
of
carriers
were
capable
of
providing
this
service
over
the
territories
covered
by
american
farm
lines,
and
there's
ample
evidence
in
the
record
on
this
point.
first,
the
defense
department
verified
statement
which
among
other
things
specifies
some
65
point-to-point
routings
and
says
that
there
is
no
known
carrier
who
can
provide
direct
service
over
those
routings.
and
i
think
in
this
connection,
it's
important
to
realize
that
the
defense
department
is
probably
the
most
experienced
shipper
in
the
western
world
moving
64
billion
pounds
of
freight
every
year.
second,
from
american
farm
lines
own
analysis
and
uncontested
analysis
of
the
authorities
of
the
seven
largest
carriers
operating
in
this
area.
of
some
2,030
routes
involved
in
those
authorities,
those
carriers
were
capable
of
providing
direct
point-to-point
service
over
only
93
of
those
routes,
less
than
5%.
third,
the
evidence
provided
by
protestants.
the
protesting
carriers
introduced
their
certificates
in
this
proceeding
and
those
certificate
shows
on
their
face
that
these
carriers
have
no
authority
to
provide
direct
single-line
service.
moreover
as
we
point
out
in
the
reply
brief,
these
very
protestants
are
standing
now
before
the
icc
with
applications
for
precisely
the
same
kind
of
authority
supported
by
the
defense
department
that
american
farm
lines
was
granted
on
a
temporary
basis
by
the
icc.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
the
consequence
would
be
i
think
substantial
mr.
chief
justice,
economically
in
direct
savings
costs
if
comparable
reductions
resulted
the
record
indicates
american
farm
lines
in
effect
to
reduced
direct
cost
by
about
10%.
the
defense
department
spends
500
--
last
year,
they
spend
$599
million
for
transportation.
that
alone
would
be
a
$59
million
saving.
there'd
be
savings
in
the
indirect
cost
because
you
have
to
carry
less
inventory
and
your
pipe
line
if
your
transit
times
are
shorter,
and
third
there'd
be
increase
safety
because
explosives
and
dangerous
materials
would
be
on
the
road
for
shorter
periods
of
time.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
--
across
the
board.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
no,
that
is
transportation
by
the
defense
department
excluding
contract
carrier
transportation
and
contract
air
transportations.
so,
it's
virtually
grand
transportation
within
the
united
states,
all
there
is
some
air
transportation
in
there.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
most
of
the
--
it
--
most
of
the
figure,
you
might
discount
it
by
5
or
10%
to
take
out
transportation
outside
the
united
states.
it
does
not
include
contract
transportation
and
a
good
portion
if
not
all
of
the
defense
transporters
abroad
are
operating
on
a
contract
basis
and
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
no,
no,
sir,
it
does
not
include
air
service
--
contract
air
service
which
is
most
of
the
air
transportation.
some
air
transportation
is
in
there.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
no
--
yes
mr.
justice.
rail
is
in
there
and
railroads
are
protesting
in
this
case.
the
array
of
briefs
before
this
court
present
a
wide
spectrum
of
views
on
the
question
whether
“efforts
have
been
made
to
obtain”
the
single-line
service
for
motor
carriers.
some
appellees
including
those
represented
by
my
colleague,
mr.
dempsey,
say
that
the
defense
department
made
such
efforts,
but
did
not
disclose
the
dates
and
results.
the
court
below
and
other
appellees
say
that
the
defense
department
made
no
such
efforts.
one
appellee
attempts
to
argue
that
the
government
brief
claims
the
defense
department
made
such
efforts
and
that
our
brief
for
american
farm
lines
indicates
that
the
department
made
no
such
efforts.
i
think
that
the
--
all
of
these
papers
fail
to
recognize
the
unique
status
of
the
defense
department
as
a
unique
shipper.
it
is
the
most
experienced
shipper
in
the
western
world
as
i
indicated
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
legal
restrictions
on
the
operating
authorities
of
the
shippers
that
has
been
using
for
years.
if
the
point
is
that
when
faced
with
eminent
curtailment
of
american
farm
line
service,
someone
in
the
defense
department
did
not
pick
up
a
telephone
and
asked
the
protestants
whether
they
could
provide
service
under
certificates
that
did
not
give
them
legal
authority
to
do
so.
obviously,
no
such
phone
calls
were
made.
they
would
resubmit
in
a
feudal
act
and
not
required
by
the
law.
if
the
question
is
whether
the
department
reviewed
its
existing
authorities,
the
existing
authorities
of
existing
carriers
which
were
serving
it
on
a
joint
line
basis
over
irregular
routes,
i
think
the
answer
is
equally
obvious.
there
are
scores
of
transportation
officials
in
the
department
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
service
these
carriers
were
capable
of
providing.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
for
the
ordinary
shipper,
the
question
--
the
icc
does
not
grant
the
new
authority
just
because
there's
a
preference
for
it.
the
concept
is
whether
or
not
there's
an
immediate
and
urgent
need
and
whether
other
carriers
can
provide
the
same
service.
the
idea
of
having
to
make
efforts
i
think
was
to
help
the
icc
as
the
icc
itself
has
said
in
the
statement
explaining
the
regulations
make
quick
adjudications
in
cases
like
this,
did
you
try
and
check
other
carriers
to
see
if
they
can
do
the
same
thing.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
it
really
--
it
goes
more
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
carriers
are
capable
of
providing
the
service,
and
that
of
course
does
relate
to
necessity.
i
would
make
one
further
point
in
terms
of
appellees
arguments
that
they
were
prejudiced
because
they
were
not
fairly
informed
of
the
charges
against
them.
appellees
like
every
other
party
in
this
case
knew
exactly
that
the
issue
here
is
whether
single
line
served
whether
the
defense
department
could
obtain
direct
single-line
service
which
it
viewed
as
materially
different
from
circuitous
joint
line
service.
every
defense
statement
presented
in
this
case
is
abundantly
clear
on
that
point.
when
the
american
trucking
association
try
to
get
the
defense
department
to
withdraw
its
support
of
american
farm
lines,
the
assistant
secretary
of
defense
for
instillations
and
logistics
wrote
to
the
president
of
the
organization
expressing
precisely
the
point
that
department
was
trying
to
get
direct
single-line
service.
the
protesting
carriers,
we
submit
fully
understood
this
and
thus
were
not
in
any
way
prejudiced
in
preparing
any
of
their
responses.
to
the
extent,
i
might
note
that
they
were
--
could
show
that
they
could
provide
this
service
was
peculiarly
also
within
their
own
ability.
they
were
the
best
people
to
show
that
because
they
had
their
own
certificates
of
authority.
i
would
make
one
point
in
closing
with
respect
to
this
case
mr.
chief
justice.
the
--
this
is
a
summary
proceeding
before
the
icc
and
which
the
standard
of
review
is
whether
there
is
any
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
commission's
decision.
commission
handles
a
5,000
temporary
authority
cases
a
year
and
we
think
there
was
ample
evidence
in
this
one
of
them
to
support
its
decision.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
--
may
i
just
make
a
couple
of
points.
one,
with
respect
to
the
regulation
mr.
justice
white
on
the
granting
of
temporary
authority
were
single-line
services
involved
that
regulation
does
go
on
to
provide
that
a
grant
of
temporary
authority
to
effectuate
single-line
service
will
be
authorized
only
when
it
is
clearly
established
that
the
carriers
providing
multiple
line
service
are
not
capable
of
or
fail
to
meet
needs.
the
same
regulations
subsection
2
of
it,
specifically
list
as
one
of
the
occasions
on
which
an
immediate
and
urgent
need
exists
in
occasion
whether
it's
“a
discontinuance
of
existing
service.”
and
i
do
you
think
it's
important
to
note
that
the
department
of
defense
had
the
service
of
american
farm
lines
for
some
two
and
half
years,
and
it
was
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
on
an
exempt
basis,
and
that
service
was
being
discontinued.
secondly,
mr.
chief
justice,
with
respect
to
the
burden
of
proof,
i
just
would
like
to
point
out
quoting
from
the
regulation,
that's
in
the
brief
filed
by
mr.
adams
in
the
american
trucking
association
that
with
respect
to
the
filing
of
protest
it
says,
“such
protest
must
be
specific
as
to
the
service
which
such
protestant
can
and
will
offer
and
must
consists
of
a
signed
original
etcetera,
etcetera.”
i
think
it's
at
best
it's
fuzzy
as
to
where
the
burden
of
proof
lies
when
you
read
this
regulation
which
follows
immediately
upon
the
regulation
listing
the
11
points.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
as
i've
indicated
in
this
many
the
appellees
have
considered,
there's
no
--
if
you
say
no
efforts
have
been
made,
that's
an
answer
to
--
that's
an
answer
to
8
and
9.
if
you
say
efforts
have
been
made,
then
the
question
is
what
kinds
of
efforts
were
made
and
what
came
out
of
them.
the
problem
--
this
is
a
procedural
rule
of
the
icc
designed
to
help
them
i
believe
and
i
think
the
problem
is
that
we
have
just
a
unique
shipper.
it's
not
like
any
other
shipper
in
the
country
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
his
statement
measures
up
under
either
of
those
alternatives.
and
we
believe
that
what
he
was
asking
for
was
clear
here
and
i
clearly
couldn't
provide
it.
finally
on
the
point
of
need,
i
would
indicate
as,
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
that
in
this
day
and
age,
if
there's
not
a
need
for
sharply
reducing
defense
cost
as
this
would
do
and
for
safety
in
moving
dangerous
materials,
i
don't
like
you
know,
it's
hard
to
think
to
put
more
urge
and
needs
we
could
have
than
that.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
consolidated
appeals
are
taken
from
a
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
washington.
that
decision
nullified
a
grant
of
temporary
motor
carrier
authority
to
my
client,
american
farm
lines.
the
appeals
present
two
questions
concerning
interstate
commerce
commission's
award
of
temporary
motor
carrier
authority.
one
relates
to
the
adequacy
of
the
evidence
to
support
the
grant
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
icc
rules.
the
other
relates
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
icc
to
reopen
a
proceeding
handing
before
it
at
a
time
when
some
of
the
parties
had
obtained
preliminary
judicial
relief
against
the
commission
and
others
have
asked
the
commission
to
reconsider
its
opinion.
appellants
have
divided
the
allotted
time
for
argument.
i
will
state
the
facts
and
deal
with
the
first
issue.
mr.
cerra
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
government
will
discuss
the
second
issue.
we
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
the
conflict
before
this
court
arises
because
of
the
determination
of
the
defense
department
to
reduce
the
time
during
which
defense
material
is
in
transit
and
does
achieve
substantial
savings,
increased
deficiency
and
with
respect
to
explosives
and
other
dangerous
cargo,
increase
safety.
until
1966,
virtually
all
defense
motor
carrier
shipments
were
on
a
joint
line
basis
by
regulated
carriers
with
routing
specified
in
detail
and
their
certificates
of
operating
authority.
the
routings
were
generally
circuitous.
they
required
several
carriers
to
transport
the
same
load
of
defense
material.
in
1966,
the
department
began
to
use
exempt
farm
cooperatives
including
american
farm
lines
to
provide
a
fast,
direct,
point-to-point
service.
the
department
use
farm
cooperatives
because
a
legislative
exemption
freed
them
from
the
certificate
restrictions
of
regulated
carriers
and
thus
enable
them
to
provide
the
direct
single-line
service.
under
this
exemption,
american
farm
lines
has
hold
substantial
amounts
of
defense
material.
its
operations
promptly
demonstrated
three
advantages
to
the
department
of
direct
service.
the
direct
savings
from
lower
direct
transportation
costs,
the
indirect
savings
from
lower
inventories
enhanced
fewer
pipe
line
costs,
and
increase
safety
in
the
movement
of
explosives
and
dangerous
materials
because
of
a
shorter
period,
a
population
exposure.
in
1968
after
two
years,
roughly
two
years
of
operation
by
american
farm
lines,
two
actions
sharply
restricted
its
ability
to
provide
this
service.
the
first
was
an
injunction
obtained
by
the
munitions
carriers
conference,
and
the
second
was
a
change
in
the
legislative
exemption
for
farm
cooperatives.
as
a
result
of
the
eminent
curtailment
of
american
farm
line
service,
american
farm
lines
supported
by
the
defense
department
applied
to
the
icc
for
temporary
authority
to
continue
its
direct
single-line
service
as
a
regulated
carrier.
protests
were
filed
by
125
proposing
carriers.
the
application
of
american
farm
lines
was
made
under
section
210a
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
that
section
authorizes
the
commission
in
its
discretion
and
without
hearings
or
other
proceedings
to
grant
such
authority
and
i
quote,
“to
enable
a
provision
of
service
for
which
there
is
an
immediate
and
urgent
need
to
a
point
who
appoints
within
a
territory
having
no
service
capable
of
needing
that
need.”
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
the
duration
of
that
authority
was
180
days
has
been
extended
the
permanent
authority
proceedings
with
the
defense
department
support.
the
hearings
have
been
completed
and
the
case
now
being
briefed
before
the
icc.
icc
regulations
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
under
decisions
of
this
court
until
the
permanent
authority
case
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
--
is
granted.
the
icc
as
i
indicated
granted
american
farm
lines
the
authority
requested.
60
protestants
of
that
point
file
petitions
for
reconsideration.
some
of
them
moved
that
the
icc
stay
its
grant
of
temporary
authority
pending
resolution
of
the
petitions
for
reconsideration.
the
icc
denied
that
motion
and
several
of
the
protestants
then
went
to
the
western
district
court
and
ask
for
a
temporary
restraining
order.
that
temporary
restraining
order
was
granted.
no
further
action
was
taken
by
the
court.
the
icc
then
reopened
its
proceedings
to
receive
additional
evidence
from
the
defense
department,
american
farm
lines,
and
the
protestants.
the
icc
promptly
notified
the
court
of
its
action
and
move
for
a
stay
of
the
courts
full
review
of
the
proceedings.
the
court,
the
western
district
court
took
no
action
on
the
commission's
motion.
in
the
reopen
proceeding,
the
defense
department
filed
a
22-page
detailed
statement
supporting
american
farm
lines.
the
statement
was
filed
by
the
director
of
transportation
policy
for
the
defense
department,
the
highest
ranking
transportation
official
in
the
department.
protestants
filed
hundreds
of
pages
of
detailed
replies
to
the
defense
statement
and
upon
reviewing
all
the
additional
evidence,
the
icc
again
granted
temporary
authority
to
american
farm
lines.
the
commission
concluded
that
the
defense
department
had
an
immediate
and
urgent
need
for
american
farm
line
services
to
discharge
its
responsibilities
for
the
national
defense.
specifically,
the
icc
found
among
the
other
things
that
the
defense
department
“imperatively
requires
service
over
the
most
direct
routes
in
a
minimum
transit
time.”
the
department
knows
of
no
carriers
in
a
position
to
meet
its
needs
and
“there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
establish
that
the
protesting
carriers
provide
a
service
to
meet
its
need.”
the
protestants
returned
to
the
district
court
and
obtain
to
stay
of
the
icc
order.
on
final
review,
the
three-judge
court
vacated
the
grant
of
temporary
authority
by
the
icc.
it
based
its
decision
on
two
grounds
essentially
that
the
department
of
defense
statement
did
not
meet
two
requirements
of
an
icc
rule
with
respect
to
supporting
shipper
statements,
and
secondly
that
the
icc
was
without
jurisdiction
to
reopen
its
proceedings
and
accept
additional
evidence.
on
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
the
fact
that
the
appellees
here
had
gone
to
the
court
to
obtain
what
we
considered
to
be
an
essentially
interlocutory
relief.
the
--
on
august
21,
1969,
mr.
justice
douglas
granted
a
stay
of
the
three-judge
court
decision
to
avoid
irreparable
injury
to
american
farm
lines,
pending
the
resolution
of
this
case
before
this
court.
the
first
issue
is
whether
the
evidence
adduced
by
the
defense
department
as
the
supporting
shipper
reasonably
complied
with
the
procedural
rules
of
the
icc.
the
icc
rules
call
upon
shippers
to
provide
11
categories
of
information
and
the
court
below
raised
no
question
about
nine
categories
of
the
information
provided
by
the
defense
department.
it
questioned
the
department's
responds
to
two
of
these
categories.
one
was
and
i
quote
“whether
efforts
have
been
made
to
obtain
the
service
from
existing
motor
rail
or
water
carriers,
and
the
dates
and
results
of
such
efforts.”
and
the
other
is
“names
and
addresses
of
existing
carriers
who
have
either
failed
or
refused
to
provide
the
service
and
the
reasons
given
for
any
such
failure
or
refusal.”
without
considering
the
record
as
a
whole,
route
considering
whether
the
record
as
a
whole
contained
evidence
to
support
the
icc
as
grant
of
temporary
authority,
the
district
court
nullified
the
commission's
order
on
the
ground
that
the
defense
department
did
not
comply
literarily
with
the
requirements
of
these
two
categories.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
if
under
a
case
that
we
believe
to
be
almost
directly
in
point,
estes
v.the
united
states
which
this
court
decided
recently,
if
the
answer
had
been
no
to
the
first
question,
there
would
been
no
requirement,
you
know,
where
efforts
made,
no
efforts
were
made.
there
would
have
been
no
requirement
to
fulfill
any
of
the
other
requirements,
and
that
also
an
effect
of
being
fairly
say
conceded
in
the
appellees'
brief.
in
the
estes
case,
the
railway
express
agency
applied
for
temporary
authority
after
a
railroad
had
announced
that
is
was
canceling
service
between
washington
and
richmond.
the
railway
express
agency
indicated
that
it
had
not
tried
to
get
that
service
from
anyone
else
because
it
was
simply
not
available.
when
the
protesting
shippers
came
in,
none
of
them
held
themselves
out
publicly
as
capable
of
providing
a
direct
service
from
richmond
to
washington,
the
conroe
(ph)
express,
and
the
lower
court
and
this
court,
the
lower
court
held
that
railway
express
was
entitled
to
the
temporary
authority
and
this
court
affirmed
that
decision
per
curium.
we
believe
that
a
careful
reading
of
the
defense
statement
against
the
categories
i've
mentioned
shows
that
the
direct
single-line
service
of
american
farm
lines
was
unique,
that
the
protesting
certificated
carriers
were
incapable
legally
of
furnishing
this
service.
and
that
the
defense
department
aware
of
this
was
not
required
to
make
efforts
in
a
conventional
sense
to
obtain
single-line
service
from
protesting
carriers
who
had
no
authority
to
furnish
it.
both
of
those
categories
you
will
note
are
concerned
only
with
one
of
the
salutatory
standards
whether
the
existing
carriers
are
capable
of
providing
the
service
involved.
the
other
standard,
the
immediacy
and
urgency
of
the
shippers
need
for
that
service
is
not
involved
in
these
two
categories.
moreover,
it's
important
to
note
that
the
icc
rules
in
of
temporary
authority
proceeding
require
only
one
thing
from
the
protesting
carrier
that
he
give
a
specific
statement
“as
to
the
service
which
such
protestant
can
and
will
offer.”
in
evaluating
the
shipper's
response
to
these
categories,
the
first
question
is
what
the
service
was?
the
service
in
this
case
was
direct
single
lines
service
covering
a
14-state
area.
in
its
verified
statement,
the
defense
department
concluded
that
this
service
was
substantially
faster
than
joint
line
regular
route
service
and
many
cases
three
times
as
fast.
the
department
believed
that
this
service
was
materially
different
from
joint
line
regular
route
service
because
of
the
direct
savings
in
transportation
costs
and
because
of
the
enormous
impact
in
indirect
savings
on
its
inventory
pipe
line.
the
next
question
in
terms
of
these
categories
is
whether
this
certificate
of
carriers
were
capable
of
providing
this
service
over
the
territories
covered
by
american
farm
lines,
and
there's
ample
evidence
in
the
record
on
this
point.
first,
the
defense
department
verified
statement
which
among
other
things
specifies
some
65
point-to-point
routings
and
says
that
there
is
no
known
carrier
who
can
provide
direct
service
over
those
routings.
and
i
think
in
this
connection,
it's
important
to
realize
that
the
defense
department
is
probably
the
most
experienced
shipper
in
the
western
world
moving
64
billion
pounds
of
freight
every
year.
second,
from
american
farm
lines
own
analysis
and
uncontested
analysis
of
the
authorities
of
the
seven
largest
carriers
operating
in
this
area.
of
some
2,030
routes
involved
in
those
authorities,
those
carriers
were
capable
of
providing
direct
point-to-point
service
over
only
93
of
those
routes,
less
than
5%.
third,
the
evidence
provided
by
protestants.
the
protesting
carriers
introduced
their
certificates
in
this
proceeding
and
those
certificate
shows
on
their
face
that
these
carriers
have
no
authority
to
provide
direct
single-line
service.
moreover
as
we
point
out
in
the
reply
brief,
these
very
protestants
are
standing
now
before
the
icc
with
applications
for
precisely
the
same
kind
of
authority
supported
by
the
defense
department
that
american
farm
lines
was
granted
on
a
temporary
basis
by
the
icc.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
the
consequence
would
be
i
think
substantial
mr.
chief
justice,
economically
in
direct
savings
costs
if
comparable
reductions
resulted
the
record
indicates
american
farm
lines
in
effect
to
reduced
direct
cost
by
about
10%.
the
defense
department
spends
500
--
last
year,
they
spend
$599
million
for
transportation.
that
alone
would
be
a
$59
million
saving.
there'd
be
savings
in
the
indirect
cost
because
you
have
to
carry
less
inventory
and
your
pipe
line
if
your
transit
times
are
shorter,
and
third
there'd
be
increase
safety
because
explosives
and
dangerous
materials
would
be
on
the
road
for
shorter
periods
of
time.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
--
across
the
board.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
no,
that
is
transportation
by
the
defense
department
excluding
contract
carrier
transportation
and
contract
air
transportations.
so,
it's
virtually
grand
transportation
within
the
united
states,
all
there
is
some
air
transportation
in
there.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
most
of
the
--
it
--
most
of
the
figure,
you
might
discount
it
by
5
or
10%
to
take
out
transportation
outside
the
united
states.
it
does
not
include
contract
transportation
and
a
good
portion
if
not
all
of
the
defense
transporters
abroad
are
operating
on
a
contract
basis
and
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
no,
no,
sir,
it
does
not
include
air
service
--
contract
air
service
which
is
most
of
the
air
transportation.
some
air
transportation
is
in
there.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
no
--
yes
mr.
justice.
rail
is
in
there
and
railroads
are
protesting
in
this
case.
the
array
of
briefs
before
this
court
present
a
wide
spectrum
of
views
on
the
question
whether
“efforts
have
been
made
to
obtain”
the
single-line
service
for
motor
carriers.
some
appellees
including
those
represented
by
my
colleague,
mr.
dempsey,
say
that
the
defense
department
made
such
efforts,
but
did
not
disclose
the
dates
and
results.
the
court
below
and
other
appellees
say
that
the
defense
department
made
no
such
efforts.
one
appellee
attempts
to
argue
that
the
government
brief
claims
the
defense
department
made
such
efforts
and
that
our
brief
for
american
farm
lines
indicates
that
the
department
made
no
such
efforts.
i
think
that
the
--
all
of
these
papers
fail
to
recognize
the
unique
status
of
the
defense
department
as
a
unique
shipper.
it
is
the
most
experienced
shipper
in
the
western
world
as
i
indicated
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
legal
restrictions
on
the
operating
authorities
of
the
shippers
that
has
been
using
for
years.
if
the
point
is
that
when
faced
with
eminent
curtailment
of
american
farm
line
service,
someone
in
the
defense
department
did
not
pick
up
a
telephone
and
asked
the
protestants
whether
they
could
provide
service
under
certificates
that
did
not
give
them
legal
authority
to
do
so.
obviously,
no
such
phone
calls
were
made.
they
would
resubmit
in
a
feudal
act
and
not
required
by
the
law.
if
the
question
is
whether
the
department
reviewed
its
existing
authorities,
the
existing
authorities
of
existing
carriers
which
were
serving
it
on
a
joint
line
basis
over
irregular
routes,
i
think
the
answer
is
equally
obvious.
there
are
scores
of
transportation
officials
in
the
department
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
service
these
carriers
were
capable
of
providing.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
for
the
ordinary
shipper,
the
question
--
the
icc
does
not
grant
the
new
authority
just
because
there's
a
preference
for
it.
the
concept
is
whether
or
not
there's
an
immediate
and
urgent
need
and
whether
other
carriers
can
provide
the
same
service.
the
idea
of
having
to
make
efforts
i
think
was
to
help
the
icc
as
the
icc
itself
has
said
in
the
statement
explaining
the
regulations
make
quick
adjudications
in
cases
like
this,
did
you
try
and
check
other
carriers
to
see
if
they
can
do
the
same
thing.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
it
really
--
it
goes
more
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
carriers
are
capable
of
providing
the
service,
and
that
of
course
does
relate
to
necessity.
i
would
make
one
further
point
in
terms
of
appellees
arguments
that
they
were
prejudiced
because
they
were
not
fairly
informed
of
the
charges
against
them.
appellees
like
every
other
party
in
this
case
knew
exactly
that
the
issue
here
is
whether
single
line
served
whether
the
defense
department
could
obtain
direct
single-line
service
which
it
viewed
as
materially
different
from
circuitous
joint
line
service.
every
defense
statement
presented
in
this
case
is
abundantly
clear
on
that
point.
when
the
american
trucking
association
try
to
get
the
defense
department
to
withdraw
its
support
of
american
farm
lines,
the
assistant
secretary
of
defense
for
instillations
and
logistics
wrote
to
the
president
of
the
organization
expressing
precisely
the
point
that
department
was
trying
to
get
direct
single-line
service.
the
protesting
carriers,
we
submit
fully
understood
this
and
thus
were
not
in
any
way
prejudiced
in
preparing
any
of
their
responses.
to
the
extent,
i
might
note
that
they
were
--
could
show
that
they
could
provide
this
service
was
peculiarly
also
within
their
own
ability.
they
were
the
best
people
to
show
that
because
they
had
their
own
certificates
of
authority.
i
would
make
one
point
in
closing
with
respect
to
this
case
mr.
chief
justice.
the
--
this
is
a
summary
proceeding
before
the
icc
and
which
the
standard
of
review
is
whether
there
is
any
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
commission's
decision.
commission
handles
a
5,000
temporary
authority
cases
a
year
and
we
think
there
was
ample
evidence
in
this
one
of
them
to
support
its
decision.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
--
may
i
just
make
a
couple
of
points.
one,
with
respect
to
the
regulation
mr.
justice
white
on
the
granting
of
temporary
authority
were
single-line
services
involved
that
regulation
does
go
on
to
provide
that
a
grant
of
temporary
authority
to
effectuate
single-line
service
will
be
authorized
only
when
it
is
clearly
established
that
the
carriers
providing
multiple
line
service
are
not
capable
of
or
fail
to
meet
needs.
the
same
regulations
subsection
2
of
it,
specifically
list
as
one
of
the
occasions
on
which
an
immediate
and
urgent
need
exists
in
occasion
whether
it's
“a
discontinuance
of
existing
service.”
and
i
do
you
think
it's
important
to
note
that
the
department
of
defense
had
the
service
of
american
farm
lines
for
some
two
and
half
years,
and
it
was
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
on
an
exempt
basis,
and
that
service
was
being
discontinued.
secondly,
mr.
chief
justice,
with
respect
to
the
burden
of
proof,
i
just
would
like
to
point
out
quoting
from
the
regulation,
that's
in
the
brief
filed
by
mr.
adams
in
the
american
trucking
association
that
with
respect
to
the
filing
of
protest
it
says,
“such
protest
must
be
specific
as
to
the
service
which
such
protestant
can
and
will
offer
and
must
consists
of
a
signed
original
etcetera,
etcetera.”
i
think
it's
at
best
it's
fuzzy
as
to
where
the
burden
of
proof
lies
when
you
read
this
regulation
which
follows
immediately
upon
the
regulation
listing
the
11
points.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
as
i've
indicated
in
this
many
the
appellees
have
considered,
there's
no
--
if
you
say
no
efforts
have
been
made,
that's
an
answer
to
--
that's
an
answer
to
8
and
9.
if
you
say
efforts
have
been
made,
then
the
question
is
what
kinds
of
efforts
were
made
and
what
came
out
of
them.
the
problem
--
this
is
a
procedural
rule
of
the
icc
designed
to
help
them
i
believe
and
i
think
the
problem
is
that
we
have
just
a
unique
shipper.
it's
not
like
any
other
shipper
in
the
country
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
his
statement
measures
up
under
either
of
those
alternatives.
and
we
believe
that
what
he
was
asking
for
was
clear
here
and
i
clearly
couldn't
provide
it.
finally
on
the
point
of
need,
i
would
indicate
as,
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
that
in
this
day
and
age,
if
there's
not
a
need
for
sharply
reducing
defense
cost
as
this
would
do
and
for
safety
in
moving
dangerous
materials,
i
don't
like
you
know,
it's
hard
to
think
to
put
more
urge
and
needs
we
could
have
than
that.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
