justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
duration
of
that
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
by
railroad
all
over
the
country
and
all
over
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
include
air
transportation,
rail
transportation,
truck
transportation?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
just
ask
you,
do
the
commission's
rules
prescribe
a
standard,
a
substantive
standard
for
when
temporary
authorities
to
be
granted
more
specifically,
do
the
rule
say
whether
or
not
the
absence
of
single-line
service
as
compared
with
joint
interline
service
is
a
basis
for
temporary
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
they
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
they
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
say
generally
that
single-line
--
the
desire
for
single-line
service
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
isn't
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now
did
the
defense
department
say
what
need
it
had
over
and
beyond
the
single-line
service?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
the
single-line
service
isn't
a
reason
for
getting
temporary
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
your
rules?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
the
--
i
gather
the
defense
department;
one
of
its
big
reasons
from
wanting
this
single-line
service
is
just
because
of
the
single-line
service?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
that
wouldn't
be
enough
under
the
rules
to
want
a
temporary
authority,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
under
that
rule
if
i
commence
and
say
well
the
only
reason
i
want
this
temporary
authority
is
to
provide
the
single-line
service
and
the
only
reason
of
what
single-line
service,
it
saves
time
and
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
only
deficiency
is
that
the
other
carriers
are
interlined.
they
haven't
got
single-line
service.
justice
byron
r.
white
single-line
--
this
rule
is
the
need
--
the
desire
for
single-line
services
sometimes
--
they
perfectly
added
at
places
for
granting
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
spite
of
this
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
without
restriction
as
to
roots
and
it
require
--
it
will
all
be
continuous
single
service
--
single-line
service?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
they
are
in
line
with
other
carriers?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
we
have
in
the
way
of
the
icc
statement
about
this,
is
it
only
their
orders
that
are
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
have
a
findings
or
anything
of
that
kind
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
just
be
the
order
of
the
division
i,
it's
order
143
(a)
and
146?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
no
opinion,
no
opinion
or
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
icc,
no
one
else
has
ever
suggested
before
that
it
was
illegal
or
somehow
improper
to
interline
explosives.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
practical
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
if
all
shippers
who
supported
temporary
application
come
forward
and
say
that
we
are
not
in
the
position
to
say
that
there
is
insufficient
or
inadequate
service
without
this
temporary
authority.
if
all
the
shippers
say
we
don't
think
there
is
anything
wrong
with
the
present,
that
the
present
services
inadequate,
but
we
just
want
better
service.
would
you
think
a
temporary
authority
would
ever
be
justified?
justice
byron
r.
white
apparently
the
--
but
do
you
think
the
icc
thinks
it
would
be?
i
don't
suppose
the
department
of
defense
ever
repudiated
these
statements
that
it
filed
certainly
the
assistant
secretary
when
he
wrote
didn't
repudiate
that
statement.
he
said
just
to
be
satisfied,
however
with
present,
the
capabilities
is
not
to
say
we
shouldn't
have
better
service.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
but
the
commission
found
--
seems
to
found
that
there
had
been
shown
an
urgent
and
immediate
need.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
apparently
construe
a
desire
for
better
service
as
urgent
and
immediate
need.
that's
certainly
not
in,
that's
not
illogical,
i
don't
suppose
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
it
isn't,
it
isn't,
i
mean
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
say
you
have
an
urgent
need
for
better
service.
justice
byron

on
an
exempt

justice
byron

what's
the

of

did
