mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
brings
up
for
review
an
order
of
the
district
court
of
appeals
in
the
state
of
florida
which
affirms
a
permanent
injunction
against
picketing.
the
picketing
was
of
the
kind
that
is
generally
known
as
area
standards
picketing.
by
which
we
mean
that
a
union
which
does
not
necessarily
represent
the
employees
in
a
particular
establishment
than
in
this
case
the
union
did
not,
but
which
does
represent
employees
engaged
in
the
same
work
in
other
establishments
in
the
area
pickets
to
publicize
the
failure
of
the
employer
to
meet
the
wage
standards
or
other
employment
conditions
under
which
his
own
employees
are
being
employed.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
no,
no.
we
take
the
position
your
honor
that
record
is
quite
clear
and
that
there
is
no
evidence
to
the
contrary
that
there
was
participation
by
american
nationals
not
part
of
the
ship's
crew,
but
we
take
the
alternative
condition
--
alternative
position
that
have
the
facts
been
otherwise
and
had
the
record
been
quite
different
from
what
it
is
and
had
the
record
disclosed
which
it
did
not,
that
all
of
the
longshore
work
but
admittedly
longshore
work
was
performed
by
members
of
the
ship's
crew
than
the
national
labor
relations
board
would
still
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
this
court's
cases
as
i
shall
develop
later
dealing
solely
with
shipboard
relations,
labor
relations
between
the
crew
acting
qua
crew
and
the
vessel
have
no
applicability
to
longshore
work
and
do
not
withdraw
jurisdiction
from
the
national
labor
relations
board
over
longshore
labor
disputes
resulting
out
of
operations
wholly
within
the
territorial
confines
of
the
united
states.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
that's
correct
your
honor.
as
i
shall
develop,
it
is
no
different
from
any
foreign
employer
employing
aliens
wholly
within
the
geographical
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
to
sift
the
fiat
automobile
manufacturing
company
of
italy
where
to
establish
an
automobile
plant
then
detroit
and
try
to
staff
it
wholly
with
italian
nationals
as
suppose
is
conceivable.
we
have
no
question
and
that
is
what
we
urge
upon
this
court
that
in
that
situation,
that
operation
would
be
subject
to
the
federal
labor
laws
as
well
as
other
federal
regulatory
laws,
and
we
are
in
effect
no
different.
this
is
work
not
traditionally
seamen's
work.
this
is
work
performed
as
much
on
shore
as
on
ship.
it
is
work
wholly
within
the
geographical
confines
and
the
considerations
which
impel
this
court
to
hold
in
the
three
cases
relied
upon
by
the
florida
courts
that
shipboard
labor
relations
are
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
labor
board
are
totally
absent
here.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
well
--
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
well,
your
honor
again,
i
have
got
to
distinguish
between
what
the
record
shows
and
what
they
contend.
and
again,
i
have
to
make
an
alternative
contention.
i
have
to
say
that
on
the
basis
of
this
record
that
point
does
not
arise,
but
were
the
record
to
be
otherwise,
we
would
still
take
sharp
issue
with
them.
first,
the
record
does
show
and
it
is
the
only
testimony
in
the
record
that
there
was
loading
of
cargo,
automobiles,
etcetera.
they
claim
the
contrary;
there
is
no
evidence
to
that
effect
in
the
record.
second
of
all
however,
they
admit
that
there
was
the
loading
and
unloading
of
baggage
and
there
was
the
loading
aboard
of
ship
stores.
there
is
actually
other
work
such
as
handling
of
lines
that
is
traditionally
longshore
work
and
we
pointed
out
particularly
in
our
reply
brief
that
this
is
work
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
already
traditionally
and
as
a
matter
of
it's
rulings
held
to
be
longshore
work,
and
it
has
done
that
on
the
basis
of
the
industrial
practice
that
prevails
in
this
country.
we
have
cited
for
example
the
nlrb
certification
of
the
longshore
unit
in
the
port
of
new
york,
which
is
of
course
by
far
the
largest
port
in
the
nation,
and
that
certification
in
express
terms
applies
to
the
loading
of
cargo
including
baggage
and
ship
stores.
we
have
cited
the
case
on
the
west
coast
in
which
the
board
assumed
jurisdiction
over
a
jurisdictional
dispute
under
section
10
(k)
involving
expressly
the
handling
of
passenger
baggage
aboard
a
foreign
cruise
ship.
and
again
on
the
basis
of
industrial
practice
where
this
is
longshore
work
and
is
historically
longshore
work
awarded
this
work
to
the
employees
represented
by
the
longshoremen's
union
on
the
west
coast.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
yes
sir,
yes.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
certainly
as
a
ship
is
coming
in
unless
they
are
going
to
jump
ashore
before
the
lines
are
cast
ashore
that
has
to
be
shore-based
employees
working
is,
and
what's
performed
here
and
was
i
think
here,
this
is
where
factually
their
wrong.
it
was
performed
by
shore-based
terminal
labor.
actually,
there
is
another
record
in
another
case
which
so
indicates
on
these
vessels
and
that
is
why
we
say,
yes,
granted
the
facts
as
they
say,
they're
still
wrong
but
the
facts
are
not
as
they
say.
and
we
would
say
your
honor
that
if
there
is
any
real
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
this
work
which
was
admittedly
performed
as
longshore
work,
that
is
for
the
labor
board
to
determine
just
as
the
labor
board
must
determine
threshold
jurisdictional
questions
such
as
the
status
of
employees,
as
supervisors
or
“employees”
within
the
meaning
of
act
whether
an
organization
is
a
labor
organization
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
otherwise,
you
have
opened
up
the
possibility
of
a
state
court,
perhaps
a
hostile
state
court
fashioning
its
findings
in
such
a
way
as
to
exclude
from
the
national
labor
relations
board
that
jurisdiction
which
congress
intended
it
to
have.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
that's
correct.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
well,
of
course,
then
you
get
to
the
question
of
who
decides
it
if
the
claim
is
well
found.
at
some
point,
you're
starting
off
with
the
claim.
somebody
has
got
to
make
a
claim
first
in
some
form
before
they
can
be
proof
for
deuced.
let's
assume
the
claim
is
made
that
this
crew
is
going
inland
several
miles
and
picking
up
ship
supplies
out
of
a
warehouse
and
doing
work
there
and
that
has
created
a
jurisdictional
dispute,
a
labor
dispute
because
this
is
traditionally
teams
to
work
under
the
teams
just
contract
for
that
very
establishment,
and
there's
a
dispute
that
arises
then,
a
claim
is
made.
i
would
have
to
say
your
honor
that
i
would
think
that
would
be
for
the
labor
board
to
determine
in
the
first
instance.
i
suppose
you
can
get
frivolous
claims,
but
i
don't
read
the
court's
decisions
and
incres
and
sociedad
nacional
to
say
that
when
there
is
a
dispute
about
the
nature
of
the
work
whether
it
seamen's
work
or
otherwise,
that
is
a
dispute
to
be
determined
judicially.
i
don't
think
those
cases
pose
that
question.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
that's
right
your
honor
and
i
don't
think
the
question
has
reached
the
court
but
the
answer
is
how
i
would
say
it
would
be
determined
which
i
emphasize
is
not
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
no.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
both.
the
record
your
honor
and
i
emphasize
the
only
record
in
this
case
of
any
evidence
is
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
on
the
application
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
held
three
days
after
commencement
of
this
action
at
which
the
respondents
here
as
plaintiffs
introduce
no
evidence
whatsoever
but
as
to
which
there
was
a
single
witness
on
this
issue
called
by
the
union
and
the
union's
president
who
testified
three
things
in
essence
and
it's
really
only
kicks
up
two
pages
in
the
record.
first,
that
the
signs
were
protesting
or
publicizing
substandard
wages;
second,
that
the
kind
of
work
which
was
involved
which
they
were
protesting
was
longshore
work,
loading
cargo,
loading
automobile,
the
ship
stores,
--
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
yes
your
honor,
we
do.
but
the
third
point
that
i
am
--
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
yes
your
honor.
if
i
may
just
say
the
third
--
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
the
third
point
he
said
was,
he
was
asked
who
is
doing
this
now
and
he
said
partly
the
crew
and
partly
american
residents
hired
locally
and
specially
for
the
occasion.
so
that
you
--
now,
the
record
does
not
disclose
what
combination
these
two
groups
worked
out
in
performing
it
whether
there
was
any
functional
division,
how
many
they
were
of
one
group
and
how
many
of
the
other
obviously
we
know
in
the
nature
of
the
case
that
handling
of
ships
line,
shore-based
had
to
be
done
by
employees
other
than
the
ship's
crew.
there
is
no
indication
at
all
as
to
the
functional
commingling
that
was
involved
there,
but
there
is
in
the
record
without
contradiction
that
the
two
groups
were
involved.
now
after
--
the
union
threw
out
of
course
contended
both
that
the
issues
were
preempted
by
the
grant
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
that
they
were
abridgements
involved
in
any
attempt
to
enjoin
this
conduct
of
the
union's
rights
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
to
publicize
its
disputes,
and
these
issues
were
preserved
for
argued
throughout.
after
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
issued
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
this
work
performed
for
a
foreign-flag
vessel
and
after
the
trial
court
in
the
hearing
ruled
that
there
was
no
abridgment
of
free
speech
because
this
was
a
violative
of
florida
law,
albeit,
there
was
no
evidence
or
claim
of
violence
or
obstructionism.
no
attribution
in
evidence
or
in
the
record
at
all
of
any
particular
objective
to
the
union's
picketing
let
alone
any
illegal
objective.
no
indication
by
the
court
as
to
what
state
rule
of
law,
statutory
or
judge
made
was
violated
by
the
objective
or
type
of
picketing
involved,
merely
the
naked
assertion
that
this
was
in
violation
of
state
law
on
the
basis
of
this
the
court
rejected
the
free
speech
argument
as
well
as
the
preemption
contention
raised
by
the
union
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order.
on
interlocutory
appeal
raising
the
preemption
question,
the
district
court
of
appeal
the
firm
the
plaintiffs
respondents
here
went
back
to
the
trial
court,
moved
for
summary
judgment
without
any
affidavits.
the
union
opposed
on
the
grounds
that
there
were
factual
issues
to
be
developed.
i
assume
the
factual
issues
of
justice
stewart
and
justice
white
have
raised
in
the
questioning
here.
the
trial
judge
granted
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
again,
we
are
granted
a
permanent
injunction
that
was
affirmed
by
the
district
court
of
appeals.
we
are
here
now
on
a
record
that
doesn't
show
a
scintilla
of
evidence,
not
a
line
of
testimony
by
a
single
witness
on
behalf
of
plaintiffs
as
to
which
a
permanent
injunction
is
now
outstanding
against
any
area
standard
to
picketing,
any
substandard
wage
picketing
on
the
part
of
this
union
that
i
--
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
no
your
honor.
there
are
provisions
of
the
injunction
that
relate
to
so
called
safety
signs
which
at
the
time
were
also
being
displayed
by
the
union.
after
the
preliminary
hearings
and
prior
to
the
--
no,
i'm
sorry.
after
the
hearings
in
the
trial
court,
after
the
grant
of
the
permanent
injunction
but
before
the
appeal
to
the
florida
appellate
courts,
the
union
expressly
abandoned
its
objections
to
that
portion
of
the
injunction
dealing
with
safety
signs
because
the
federal
authorities
have
tightened
safety
regulations
on
foreign
cruise
ships
touching
american
ports
as
well
domestic
ships
and
the
union
regard
that
this
no
longer
important.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
one
and
two.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
well,
four
as
i
read
under
some
ambiguity,
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
of
appeals,
i
think
the
district
court
of
appeals
intended
to
annul
paragraph
four
in
it's
entirety,
although
that's
not
entirely
clear.
so,
it
is
really
paragraph
three
of
the
numbered
paragraphs
that
is
an
issue.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
a
fortiori,
we
would
challenge
that,
that's
even
broader
than
paragraph
three.
and
we
would
also
challenge
the
preliminary
unnumbered
paragraphs
which
appear
to
be
decreedal
in
nature,
though
they
don't
appear
to
be
enjoining
the
union
for
many
conduct.
but
it
is
primarily
paragraph
three
that
is
that
issue.
now
on
the
preemption
point,
it
is
our
contention
essentially
that
the
considerations
which
led
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
seamen's
cases
have
no
bearing
here.
in
those
cases,
this
court
was
persuaded
by
not
the
possibility
of
a
conflict
with
foreign
law,
foreign
regulations,
international
treaties
to
which
this
nation
was
a
party,
but
the
inevitability
of
such
conflict.
the
relations
between
seamen
and
the
ship
necessarily
continue
wherever
the
ship
goes
throughout
the
high
seas
and
that
any
port
of
call
including
ports
in
the
united
states
and
ports
in
the
nation
of
registry.
they're
kind
in
the
nature
of
the
case
to
be
only
a
single
set
of
laws
governing
this
unitary
relationship,
a
single
union
representing
the
crew.
you
can't
have
separate
unions
depending
on
which
port
of
the
ship
is
in
it
any
one
moment,
etcetera.
and
for
these
reasons,
there
has
developed
the
law
of
the
flag
and
the
principle
generally
that
as
a
pragmatic
expedient
that
there
being
one
law
that
must
predominate
the
law
of
the
flag
will
be
that
law,
and
it
was
this
principle
in
effect
that
court
invoked
in
the
seamen's
cases
in
saying
that
although
the
language
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
maybe
sufficiently
broad
to
cover
this
type
of
dispute
absent
any
clearer
expression
of
congressional
intent,
the
court
would
not
assume
that
congress
intended
to
very
so
the
general
relations
among
the
nations.
now
this
just
doesn't
apply
at
all
when
there
is
a
longshore
dispute
even
if
exclusively
the
ship's
crew
were
involved
in
performing
the
work.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
that's
correct.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
correct.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
your
honor
--
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
insofar
--
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
well,
that
is
correct
partially.
we
were
objecting
to
whoever
was
performing
the
longshore
work
and
on
this
record,
it
was
two
classes
of
people.
insofar
as
this
footnote
indicates
that
we
were
only
--
we
might
have
only
been
objecting
to
the
work
insofar
as
performed
only
by
--
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
yes
sir.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
correct.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
absolutely.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
absolutely.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
then
it
should
go
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
determine
how
the
combined
set
of
facts
and
the
considerations
that
apply
to
the
combined
set
of
facts
yield
a
result
consonant
with
the
terms
of
the
act
and
this
court's
decisions
beginning
--
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
mr.
justice
white
has
in
his
question
assumed
i
was
wrong
on
my
primary
legal
thesis.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
yes.
if
i
make
that
same
assumption,
the
reason
i
have
to
those,
i
didn't
know
whether
that
assumption
implicit
in
your
part.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
with
that
assumption,
i
agree
with
footnote
6.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
without
that
assumption
and
on
my
argument
as
it
is,
i
disagree
with
footnote
6
of
the
board's
brief.
perhaps
the
board
was
burned
a
little
too
much
in
incres
in
this
withdrawing
more
than
it
should.
i
would
not
say
that
this
should
be
a
balancing
of
contacts
in
longshore
disputes
any
more
than
the
court
felt
contrary
to
the
position
expressed
both
by
the
department
of
justice
and
the
board
in
incres
that
a
balancing
of
contacts
to
some
extent
should
apply
in
the
seamen's
case.
i
think
the
balancing
of
contacts
if
we're
going
to
talk
of
that
should
be
performed
by
this
court
as
it
did
in
the
seamen's
case
but
with
the
opposite
result.
we
say
the
labor
board
does
have
jurisdiction,
we
would
be
here
complaining
if
they
decline
jurisdiction
whether
the
work
were
performed
by
the
ship's
crew
or
by
a
mixed
group.
this
work
has
no
extraterritorial
consequences.
the
board's
assumption
of
jurisdiction
applies
totally
within
american
territories.
there
is
no
indication
in
this
record
or
in
any
brief
that
the
--
any
foreign
nation
has
sought
to
regulate
purely
longshore
labor
disputes
in
ports
of
another
country.
this
would
be
contrary
not
only
to
the
international
law,
the
law
of
the
flag
and
its
converse,
the
law
of
territorial
jurisdiction.
it
is
contrary
to
industrial
reality
throughout
the
world
because
when
we
emphasize
this
in
our
briefs,
the
longshoreman
is
not
a
uniquely
american
industrial
creation.
we
haven't
cut
out
excised
a
portion
of
the
normal
seamen's
trade
and
given
it
to
some
other
group
of
people.
the
longshoremen
and
the
seamen
are
functionally
and
individually
diverse
in
every
country
of
the
world
in
every
major
part
of
the
world
as
far
as
i
know.
we've
cited
international
conventions,
international
labor
enactments
which
apply
to
the
work
of
a
longshoreman,
the
loading
and
unloading
of
cargo.
we've
cited
domestic
laws
to
the
same
effect.
we
are
dealing
here
with
an
american
situation
which
parallels
the
international
situation
and
in
other
countries
as
well,
they
expect
to
and
do
regulate
their
longshore
labor
disputes
under
their
own
laws
no
matter
who
is
performing
the
work,
and
that
is
precisely
what
we
say
should
apply
here.
we
have
--
may
i
just
raise
one
other
point
in
connection
with
the
record?
now
this
relates
primarily
to
something
that
mr.
justice
white
mentioned.
in
terms
of
the
state
of
the
record,
i
do
want
to
emphasize
what
we
pointed
out
in
our
briefs
that
the
district
court
of
appeals
in
florida
seemed
to
view
this
case
somewhat
as
the
government's
brief
footnote
6
does,
it
although
affirming
described
the
picketing
as
protesting
the
employment
of
american
residents;
perhaps
i
can
say
that
is
more
favorable
to
us
than
need
be.
i
merely
emphasize
that
certainly
the
district
court
of
appeal
did
not
rest
its
decision
on
the
ground
that
this
was
the
foreign
crew
performing
the
work.
they
seem
to
exclude
the
foreign
crew
as
longshore
labor
or
entirely
in
the
district
court
of
appeals
opinion.
they
rested
exclusively
on
the
fact
that
this
was
a
foreign-flag
vessel,
so
that
we
do
not
have
a
case
where
the
state
courts
contrary
to
the
record
adopted
the
position
urged
by
respondents.
this
is
not
one
of
those
--
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
i
would
think
your
honors
that
they
should
still
be
reversal
on
the
ground
that
this
records
shows
without
contradiction
that
this
work
was
being
performed
at
least
impart
by
american
residents
hired
locally.
in
which
case,
we
would
urge
that
footnote
6
of
the
government
brief
correctly
sets
forth
the
result,
namely
that
the
nlrb
still
has
jurisdiction
in
the
first
instance
to
consider
that.
and
this
is
not
the
case
where
the
record
facts
are
in
contradiction.
they're
very
clear
as
to
what
they
show.
respondents
may
disagree,
but
respondents
did
not
bring
that
disagreement
to
the
trial
court
or
to
any
other
florida
state
court
in
the
form
of
evidence
or
the
like.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
that's
correct,
that's
correct
your
honor.
now,
i
just
want
to
emphasize
what
i
said
earlier.
if
one
were
to
immunize
the
work
performed
by
the
ship's
crew
from
labor
board
jurisdiction
when
that
work
is
not
seamen's
work,
when
that
work
is
performed
within
american
territorial
confines
exclusively,
when
that
work
is
performed
on
shore,
then
i
think
a
pandora's
box
has
been
opened.
the
ship's
crew
of
foreign-flag
vessels
that
traditionally
paid
well
below
american
standards,
their
conditions
generally
are
well
below
american
standards,
and
there
would
be
no
problem
at
all
in
the
ship
went
in
port,
assigning
its
crew
to
do
terminal
work,
to
do
not
only
the
loading
and
the
unloading
of
the
ship
but
to
do
the
loading
and
unloading
of
the
trucks,
bringing
in
cargo
or
taking
cargo
away,
to
do
ship
repair
work
and
dry
dock,
and
as
i
say
even
to
go
inland
and
pick
up
supplies.
and
to
me
at
least,
it
would
be
unthinkable
but
given
a
statute
which
is
expressly
designed
to
eliminate
or
minimize
disruptive
industrial
disputes
and
to
secure
uniformity
that
the
national
board
would
be
powerless
to
step
in
to
the
kind
of
labor
disputes
that
would
inevitably
ensue
in
that
kind
of
a
situation.
we
just
think
that
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
board
has
and
must
have
jurisdiction.
and
if
i
may
just
very
briefly
touch
on
the
free
speech
point,
this
court
has
held
that
in
applying
the
constitutional
protections
of
free
speech
to
picketing.
picketing
is
free
speech
plus
and
therefore
one
must
balance
the
union's
rights
to
express
and
publicize
its
disputes
and
the
states
rights
to
control
the
plus
element.
but
in
doing
that,
this
court
has
set
forth
certain
conditions
to
circumscribe
the
state
because
there
are
constitutional
considerations.
first,
the
state
must
define
the
unlawful
objective.
second,
the
evidence
must
be
federally
reviewable
and
must
support
the
conclusion
that
there
has
been
this
unlawful
objective.
and
third,
the
unlawful
objective
must
pass
federal
constitutional
muster.
for
example,
the
states
may
not
demand
contract
privity
as
a
necessary
condition
of
picketing;
that
is
an
archaic
economically
unrealistic
limitation
of
the
boundaries
of
labor
dispute
and
this
court
as
so
held
for
30
years.
here,
there
is
no
evidence.
there
is
no
state
articulation
of
the
unlawful
objective.
there
is
no
state
finding
or
conclusion
or
expression
in
any
opinion
as
to
what
objective
they
do
think
the
union
had,
and
there
is
no
indication
what
particular
rule
of
law
the
union
is
supposed
to
have
violated.
there
is
no
opportunity
for
this
court
or
any
court
to
pass
upon
the
states
standards
because
they
never
express.
and
we
think
that
this
record
fails
so
abysmally
to
meet
the
standards
of
the
court
has
set
in
the
picketing
cases.
it
almost
reaches
a
due
process
point
of
the
kind
expressed
in
thompson
against
louisville
and
gregory
against
chicago
and
similar
cases.
unless
there
are
further
question,
if
i
had
time,
i
would
like
to
reserve
that
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
i
can't
do
too
much
in
a
minute
but
may
i
just
make
these
brief
points.
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
the
question
about
handling
of
lines.
mr.
leslie
's
memory
failed
him
because
of
the
deposition
of
mr.
kaine's
in
the
eastern
case,
not
in
this
case
and
i
don't
think
it
is
properly
before
the
court,
but
it
is
there
on
pages
12
and
13
of
that
deposition.
mr.
kaine
said,
“the
handling
of
lines
is
done
by
a
shore
side
employees;
not
by
ship's
crew
by
a
shore
gang”
so
that
is
in
the
record
of
the
eastern
case.
but
this
kaine
deposition
baffles
me.
this
is
a
deposition
taken
in
a
lawyer's
office
in
another
case
that
apparently
somehow
is
filed
in
this
case;
i
can't
see
the
slightest
procedural
way
that
it
ever
came
to
the
attention
of
the
court
in
this
case.
i
see
no
reference
to
it
in
any
motion
preserving
order,
statement
by
the
court
or
by
counsel,
i
don't
think
the
judge
was
ever
aware
of
it,
i
don't
see
how
any
counsel
can
argue
to
a
court
let
alone
the
supreme
court
that
facts
are
established
by
a
deposition
taken
in
another
case
by
a
lawyer
in
his
office
that
never
comes
to
the
attention
of
a
court.
your
honors
i
won't
trespass
any
further.
thank
you.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
brings
up
for
review
an
order
of
the
district
court
of
appeals
in
the
state
of
florida
which
affirms
a
permanent
injunction
against
picketing.
the
picketing
was
of
the
kind
that
is
generally
known
as
area
standards
picketing.
by
which
we
mean
that
a
union
which
does
not
necessarily
represent
the
employees
in
a
particular
establishment
than
in
this
case
the
union
did
not,
but
which
does
represent
employees
engaged
in
the
same
work
in
other
establishments
in
the
area
pickets
to
publicize
the
failure
of
the
employer
to
meet
the
wage
standards
or
other
employment
conditions
under
which
his
own
employees
are
being
employed.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
no,
no.
we
take
the
position
your
honor
that
record
is
quite
clear
and
that
there
is
no
evidence
to
the
contrary
that
there
was
participation
by
american
nationals
not
part
of
the
ship's
crew,
but
we
take
the
alternative
condition
--
alternative
position
that
have
the
facts
been
otherwise
and
had
the
record
been
quite
different
from
what
it
is
and
had
the
record
disclosed
which
it
did
not,
that
all
of
the
longshore
work
but
admittedly
longshore
work
was
performed
by
members
of
the
ship's
crew
than
the
national
labor
relations
board
would
still
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
this
court's
cases
as
i
shall
develop
later
dealing
solely
with
shipboard
relations,
labor
relations
between
the
crew
acting
qua
crew
and
the
vessel
have
no
applicability
to
longshore
work
and
do
not
withdraw
jurisdiction
from
the
national
labor
relations
board
over
longshore
labor
disputes
resulting
out
of
operations
wholly
within
the
territorial
confines
of
the
united
states.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
that's
correct
your
honor.
as
i
shall
develop,
it
is
no
different
from
any
foreign
employer
employing
aliens
wholly
within
the
geographical
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
to
sift
the
fiat
automobile
manufacturing
company
of
italy
where
to
establish
an
automobile
plant
then
detroit
and
try
to
staff
it
wholly
with
italian
nationals
as
suppose
is
conceivable.
we
have
no
question
and
that
is
what
we
urge
upon
this
court
that
in
that
situation,
that
operation
would
be
subject
to
the
federal
labor
laws
as
well
as
other
federal
regulatory
laws,
and
we
are
in
effect
no
different.
this
is
work
not
traditionally
seamen's
work.
this
is
work
performed
as
much
on
shore
as
on
ship.
it
is
work
wholly
within
the
geographical
confines
and
the
considerations
which
impel
this
court
to
hold
in
the
three
cases
relied
upon
by
the
florida
courts
that
shipboard
labor
relations
are
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
labor
board
are
totally
absent
here.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
well
--
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
well,
your
honor
again,
i
have
got
to
distinguish
between
what
the
record
shows
and
what
they
contend.
and
again,
i
have
to
make
an
alternative
contention.
i
have
to
say
that
on
the
basis
of
this
record
that
point
does
not
arise,
but
were
the
record
to
be
otherwise,
we
would
still
take
sharp
issue
with
them.
first,
the
record
does
show
and
it
is
the
only
testimony
in
the
record
that
there
was
loading
of
cargo,
automobiles,
etcetera.
they
claim
the
contrary;
there
is
no
evidence
to
that
effect
in
the
record.
second
of
all
however,
they
admit
that
there
was
the
loading
and
unloading
of
baggage
and
there
was
the
loading
aboard
of
ship
stores.
there
is
actually
other
work
such
as
handling
of
lines
that
is
traditionally
longshore
work
and
we
pointed
out
particularly
in
our
reply
brief
that
this
is
work
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
already
traditionally
and
as
a
matter
of
it's
rulings
held
to
be
longshore
work,
and
it
has
done
that
on
the
basis
of
the
industrial
practice
that
prevails
in
this
country.
we
have
cited
for
example
the
nlrb
certification
of
the
longshore
unit
in
the
port
of
new
york,
which
is
of
course
by
far
the
largest
port
in
the
nation,
and
that
certification
in
express
terms
applies
to
the
loading
of
cargo
including
baggage
and
ship
stores.
we
have
cited
the
case
on
the
west
coast
in
which
the
board
assumed
jurisdiction
over
a
jurisdictional
dispute
under
section
10
(k)
involving
expressly
the
handling
of
passenger
baggage
aboard
a
foreign
cruise
ship.
and
again
on
the
basis
of
industrial
practice
where
this
is
longshore
work
and
is
historically
longshore
work
awarded
this
work
to
the
employees
represented
by
the
longshoremen's
union
on
the
west
coast.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
yes
sir,
yes.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
certainly
as
a
ship
is
coming
in
unless
they
are
going
to
jump
ashore
before
the
lines
are
cast
ashore
that
has
to
be
shore-based
employees
working
is,
and
what's
performed
here
and
was
i
think
here,
this
is
where
factually
their
wrong.
it
was
performed
by
shore-based
terminal
labor.
actually,
there
is
another
record
in
another
case
which
so
indicates
on
these
vessels
and
that
is
why
we
say,
yes,
granted
the
facts
as
they
say,
they're
still
wrong
but
the
facts
are
not
as
they
say.
and
we
would
say
your
honor
that
if
there
is
any
real
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
this
work
which
was
admittedly
performed
as
longshore
work,
that
is
for
the
labor
board
to
determine
just
as
the
labor
board
must
determine
threshold
jurisdictional
questions
such
as
the
status
of
employees,
as
supervisors
or
“employees”
within
the
meaning
of
act
whether
an
organization
is
a
labor
organization
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
otherwise,
you
have
opened
up
the
possibility
of
a
state
court,
perhaps
a
hostile
state
court
fashioning
its
findings
in
such
a
way
as
to
exclude
from
the
national
labor
relations
board
that
jurisdiction
which
congress
intended
it
to
have.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
that's
correct.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
well,
of
course,
then
you
get
to
the
question
of
who
decides
it
if
the
claim
is
well
found.
at
some
point,
you're
starting
off
with
the
claim.
somebody
has
got
to
make
a
claim
first
in
some
form
before
they
can
be
proof
for
deuced.
let's
assume
the
claim
is
made
that
this
crew
is
going
inland
several
miles
and
picking
up
ship
supplies
out
of
a
warehouse
and
doing
work
there
and
that
has
created
a
jurisdictional
dispute,
a
labor
dispute
because
this
is
traditionally
teams
to
work
under
the
teams
just
contract
for
that
very
establishment,
and
there's
a
dispute
that
arises
then,
a
claim
is
made.
i
would
have
to
say
your
honor
that
i
would
think
that
would
be
for
the
labor
board
to
determine
in
the
first
instance.
i
suppose
you
can
get
frivolous
claims,
but
i
don't
read
the
court's
decisions
and
incres
and
sociedad
nacional
to
say
that
when
there
is
a
dispute
about
the
nature
of
the
work
whether
it
seamen's
work
or
otherwise,
that
is
a
dispute
to
be
determined
judicially.
i
don't
think
those
cases
pose
that
question.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
that's
right
your
honor
and
i
don't
think
the
question
has
reached
the
court
but
the
answer
is
how
i
would
say
it
would
be
determined
which
i
emphasize
is
not
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
no.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
both.
the
record
your
honor
and
i
emphasize
the
only
record
in
this
case
of
any
evidence
is
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
on
the
application
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
held
three
days
after
commencement
of
this
action
at
which
the
respondents
here
as
plaintiffs
introduce
no
evidence
whatsoever
but
as
to
which
there
was
a
single
witness
on
this
issue
called
by
the
union
and
the
union's
president
who
testified
three
things
in
essence
and
it's
really
only
kicks
up
two
pages
in
the
record.
first,
that
the
signs
were
protesting
or
publicizing
substandard
wages;
second,
that
the
kind
of
work
which
was
involved
which
they
were
protesting
was
longshore
work,
loading
cargo,
loading
automobile,
the
ship
stores,
--
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
yes
your
honor,
we
do.
but
the
third
point
that
i
am
--
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
yes
your
honor.
if
i
may
just
say
the
third
--
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
the
third
point
he
said
was,
he
was
asked
who
is
doing
this
now
and
he
said
partly
the
crew
and
partly
american
residents
hired
locally
and
specially
for
the
occasion.
so
that
you
--
now,
the
record
does
not
disclose
what
combination
these
two
groups
worked
out
in
performing
it
whether
there
was
any
functional
division,
how
many
they
were
of
one
group
and
how
many
of
the
other
obviously
we
know
in
the
nature
of
the
case
that
handling
of
ships
line,
shore-based
had
to
be
done
by
employees
other
than
the
ship's
crew.
there
is
no
indication
at
all
as
to
the
functional
commingling
that
was
involved
there,
but
there
is
in
the
record
without
contradiction
that
the
two
groups
were
involved.
now
after
--
the
union
threw
out
of
course
contended
both
that
the
issues
were
preempted
by
the
grant
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
that
they
were
abridgements
involved
in
any
attempt
to
enjoin
this
conduct
of
the
union's
rights
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
to
publicize
its
disputes,
and
these
issues
were
preserved
for
argued
throughout.
after
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
issued
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
this
work
performed
for
a
foreign-flag
vessel
and
after
the
trial
court
in
the
hearing
ruled
that
there
was
no
abridgment
of
free
speech
because
this
was
a
violative
of
florida
law,
albeit,
there
was
no
evidence
or
claim
of
violence
or
obstructionism.
no
attribution
in
evidence
or
in
the
record
at
all
of
any
particular
objective
to
the
union's
picketing
let
alone
any
illegal
objective.
no
indication
by
the
court
as
to
what
state
rule
of
law,
statutory
or
judge
made
was
violated
by
the
objective
or
type
of
picketing
involved,
merely
the
naked
assertion
that
this
was
in
violation
of
state
law
on
the
basis
of
this
the
court
rejected
the
free
speech
argument
as
well
as
the
preemption
contention
raised
by
the
union
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order.
on
interlocutory
appeal
raising
the
preemption
question,
the
district
court
of
appeal
the
firm
the
plaintiffs
respondents
here
went
back
to
the
trial
court,
moved
for
summary
judgment
without
any
affidavits.
the
union
opposed
on
the
grounds
that
there
were
factual
issues
to
be
developed.
i
assume
the
factual
issues
of
justice
stewart
and
justice
white
have
raised
in
the
questioning
here.
the
trial
judge
granted
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
again,
we
are
granted
a
permanent
injunction
that
was
affirmed
by
the
district
court
of
appeals.
we
are
here
now
on
a
record
that
doesn't
show
a
scintilla
of
evidence,
not
a
line
of
testimony
by
a
single
witness
on
behalf
of
plaintiffs
as
to
which
a
permanent
injunction
is
now
outstanding
against
any
area
standard
to
picketing,
any
substandard
wage
picketing
on
the
part
of
this
union
that
i
--
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
no
your
honor.
there
are
provisions
of
the
injunction
that
relate
to
so
called
safety
signs
which
at
the
time
were
also
being
displayed
by
the
union.
after
the
preliminary
hearings
and
prior
to
the
--
no,
i'm
sorry.
after
the
hearings
in
the
trial
court,
after
the
grant
of
the
permanent
injunction
but
before
the
appeal
to
the
florida
appellate
courts,
the
union
expressly
abandoned
its
objections
to
that
portion
of
the
injunction
dealing
with
safety
signs
because
the
federal
authorities
have
tightened
safety
regulations
on
foreign
cruise
ships
touching
american
ports
as
well
domestic
ships
and
the
union
regard
that
this
no
longer
important.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
one
and
two.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
well,
four
as
i
read
under
some
ambiguity,
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
of
appeals,
i
think
the
district
court
of
appeals
intended
to
annul
paragraph
four
in
it's
entirety,
although
that's
not
entirely
clear.
so,
it
is
really
paragraph
three
of
the
numbered
paragraphs
that
is
an
issue.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
a
fortiori,
we
would
challenge
that,
that's
even
broader
than
paragraph
three.
and
we
would
also
challenge
the
preliminary
unnumbered
paragraphs
which
appear
to
be
decreedal
in
nature,
though
they
don't
appear
to
be
enjoining
the
union
for
many
conduct.
but
it
is
primarily
paragraph
three
that
is
that
issue.
now
on
the
preemption
point,
it
is
our
contention
essentially
that
the
considerations
which
led
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
seamen's
cases
have
no
bearing
here.
in
those
cases,
this
court
was
persuaded
by
not
the
possibility
of
a
conflict
with
foreign
law,
foreign
regulations,
international
treaties
to
which
this
nation
was
a
party,
but
the
inevitability
of
such
conflict.
the
relations
between
seamen
and
the
ship
necessarily
continue
wherever
the
ship
goes
throughout
the
high
seas
and
that
any
port
of
call
including
ports
in
the
united
states
and
ports
in
the
nation
of
registry.
they're
kind
in
the
nature
of
the
case
to
be
only
a
single
set
of
laws
governing
this
unitary
relationship,
a
single
union
representing
the
crew.
you
can't
have
separate
unions
depending
on
which
port
of
the
ship
is
in
it
any
one
moment,
etcetera.
and
for
these
reasons,
there
has
developed
the
law
of
the
flag
and
the
principle
generally
that
as
a
pragmatic
expedient
that
there
being
one
law
that
must
predominate
the
law
of
the
flag
will
be
that
law,
and
it
was
this
principle
in
effect
that
court
invoked
in
the
seamen's
cases
in
saying
that
although
the
language
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
maybe
sufficiently
broad
to
cover
this
type
of
dispute
absent
any
clearer
expression
of
congressional
intent,
the
court
would
not
assume
that
congress
intended
to
very
so
the
general
relations
among
the
nations.
now
this
just
doesn't
apply
at
all
when
there
is
a
longshore
dispute
even
if
exclusively
the
ship's
crew
were
involved
in
performing
the
work.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
that's
correct.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
correct.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
your
honor
--
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
insofar
--
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
well,
that
is
correct
partially.
we
were
objecting
to
whoever
was
performing
the
longshore
work
and
on
this
record,
it
was
two
classes
of
people.
insofar
as
this
footnote
indicates
that
we
were
only
--
we
might
have
only
been
objecting
to
the
work
insofar
as
performed
only
by
--
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
yes
sir.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
correct.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
absolutely.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
absolutely.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
then
it
should
go
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
determine
how
the
combined
set
of
facts
and
the
considerations
that
apply
to
the
combined
set
of
facts
yield
a
result
consonant
with
the
terms
of
the
act
and
this
court's
decisions
beginning
--
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
mr.
justice
white
has
in
his
question
assumed
i
was
wrong
on
my
primary
legal
thesis.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
yes.
if
i
make
that
same
assumption,
the
reason
i
have
to
those,
i
didn't
know
whether
that
assumption
implicit
in
your
part.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
with
that
assumption,
i
agree
with
footnote
6.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
without
that
assumption
and
on
my
argument
as
it
is,
i
disagree
with
footnote
6
of
the
board's
brief.
perhaps
the
board
was
burned
a
little
too
much
in
incres
in
this
withdrawing
more
than
it
should.
i
would
not
say
that
this
should
be
a
balancing
of
contacts
in
longshore
disputes
any
more
than
the
court
felt
contrary
to
the
position
expressed
both
by
the
department
of
justice
and
the
board
in
incres
that
a
balancing
of
contacts
to
some
extent
should
apply
in
the
seamen's
case.
i
think
the
balancing
of
contacts
if
we're
going
to
talk
of
that
should
be
performed
by
this
court
as
it
did
in
the
seamen's
case
but
with
the
opposite
result.
we
say
the
labor
board
does
have
jurisdiction,
we
would
be
here
complaining
if
they
decline
jurisdiction
whether
the
work
were
performed
by
the
ship's
crew
or
by
a
mixed
group.
this
work
has
no
extraterritorial
consequences.
the
board's
assumption
of
jurisdiction
applies
totally
within
american
territories.
there
is
no
indication
in
this
record
or
in
any
brief
that
the
--
any
foreign
nation
has
sought
to
regulate
purely
longshore
labor
disputes
in
ports
of
another
country.
this
would
be
contrary
not
only
to
the
international
law,
the
law
of
the
flag
and
its
converse,
the
law
of
territorial
jurisdiction.
it
is
contrary
to
industrial
reality
throughout
the
world
because
when
we
emphasize
this
in
our
briefs,
the
longshoreman
is
not
a
uniquely
american
industrial
creation.
we
haven't
cut
out
excised
a
portion
of
the
normal
seamen's
trade
and
given
it
to
some
other
group
of
people.
the
longshoremen
and
the
seamen
are
functionally
and
individually
diverse
in
every
country
of
the
world
in
every
major
part
of
the
world
as
far
as
i
know.
we've
cited
international
conventions,
international
labor
enactments
which
apply
to
the
work
of
a
longshoreman,
the
loading
and
unloading
of
cargo.
we've
cited
domestic
laws
to
the
same
effect.
we
are
dealing
here
with
an
american
situation
which
parallels
the
international
situation
and
in
other
countries
as
well,
they
expect
to
and
do
regulate
their
longshore
labor
disputes
under
their
own
laws
no
matter
who
is
performing
the
work,
and
that
is
precisely
what
we
say
should
apply
here.
we
have
--
may
i
just
raise
one
other
point
in
connection
with
the
record?
now
this
relates
primarily
to
something
that
mr.
justice
white
mentioned.
in
terms
of
the
state
of
the
record,
i
do
want
to
emphasize
what
we
pointed
out
in
our
briefs
that
the
district
court
of
appeals
in
florida
seemed
to
view
this
case
somewhat
as
the
government's
brief
footnote
6
does,
it
although
affirming
described
the
picketing
as
protesting
the
employment
of
american
residents;
perhaps
i
can
say
that
is
more
favorable
to
us
than
need
be.
i
merely
emphasize
that
certainly
the
district
court
of
appeal
did
not
rest
its
decision
on
the
ground
that
this
was
the
foreign
crew
performing
the
work.
they
seem
to
exclude
the
foreign
crew
as
longshore
labor
or
entirely
in
the
district
court
of
appeals
opinion.
they
rested
exclusively
on
the
fact
that
this
was
a
foreign-flag
vessel,
so
that
we
do
not
have
a
case
where
the
state
courts
contrary
to
the
record
adopted
the
position
urged
by
respondents.
this
is
not
one
of
those
--
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
i
would
think
your
honors
that
they
should
still
be
reversal
on
the
ground
that
this
records
shows
without
contradiction
that
this
work
was
being
performed
at
least
impart
by
american
residents
hired
locally.
in
which
case,
we
would
urge
that
footnote
6
of
the
government
brief
correctly
sets
forth
the
result,
namely
that
the
nlrb
still
has
jurisdiction
in
the
first
instance
to
consider
that.
and
this
is
not
the
case
where
the
record
facts
are
in
contradiction.
they're
very
clear
as
to
what
they
show.
respondents
may
disagree,
but
respondents
did
not
bring
that
disagreement
to
the
trial
court
or
to
any
other
florida
state
court
in
the
form
of
evidence
or
the
like.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
that's
correct,
that's
correct
your
honor.
now,
i
just
want
to
emphasize
what
i
said
earlier.
if
one
were
to
immunize
the
work
performed
by
the
ship's
crew
from
labor
board
jurisdiction
when
that
work
is
not
seamen's
work,
when
that
work
is
performed
within
american
territorial
confines
exclusively,
when
that
work
is
performed
on
shore,
then
i
think
a
pandora's
box
has
been
opened.
the
ship's
crew
of
foreign-flag
vessels
that
traditionally
paid
well
below
american
standards,
their
conditions
generally
are
well
below
american
standards,
and
there
would
be
no
problem
at
all
in
the
ship
went
in
port,
assigning
its
crew
to
do
terminal
work,
to
do
not
only
the
loading
and
the
unloading
of
the
ship
but
to
do
the
loading
and
unloading
of
the
trucks,
bringing
in
cargo
or
taking
cargo
away,
to
do
ship
repair
work
and
dry
dock,
and
as
i
say
even
to
go
inland
and
pick
up
supplies.
and
to
me
at
least,
it
would
be
unthinkable
but
given
a
statute
which
is
expressly
designed
to
eliminate
or
minimize
disruptive
industrial
disputes
and
to
secure
uniformity
that
the
national
board
would
be
powerless
to
step
in
to
the
kind
of
labor
disputes
that
would
inevitably
ensue
in
that
kind
of
a
situation.
we
just
think
that
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
board
has
and
must
have
jurisdiction.
and
if
i
may
just
very
briefly
touch
on
the
free
speech
point,
this
court
has
held
that
in
applying
the
constitutional
protections
of
free
speech
to
picketing.
picketing
is
free
speech
plus
and
therefore
one
must
balance
the
union's
rights
to
express
and
publicize
its
disputes
and
the
states
rights
to
control
the
plus
element.
but
in
doing
that,
this
court
has
set
forth
certain
conditions
to
circumscribe
the
state
because
there
are
constitutional
considerations.
first,
the
state
must
define
the
unlawful
objective.
second,
the
evidence
must
be
federally
reviewable
and
must
support
the
conclusion
that
there
has
been
this
unlawful
objective.
and
third,
the
unlawful
objective
must
pass
federal
constitutional
muster.
for
example,
the
states
may
not
demand
contract
privity
as
a
necessary
condition
of
picketing;
that
is
an
archaic
economically
unrealistic
limitation
of
the
boundaries
of
labor
dispute
and
this
court
as
so
held
for
30
years.
here,
there
is
no
evidence.
there
is
no
state
articulation
of
the
unlawful
objective.
there
is
no
state
finding
or
conclusion
or
expression
in
any
opinion
as
to
what
objective
they
do
think
the
union
had,
and
there
is
no
indication
what
particular
rule
of
law
the
union
is
supposed
to
have
violated.
there
is
no
opportunity
for
this
court
or
any
court
to
pass
upon
the
states
standards
because
they
never
express.
and
we
think
that
this
record
fails
so
abysmally
to
meet
the
standards
of
the
court
has
set
in
the
picketing
cases.
it
almost
reaches
a
due
process
point
of
the
kind
expressed
in
thompson
against
louisville
and
gregory
against
chicago
and
similar
cases.
unless
there
are
further
question,
if
i
had
time,
i
would
like
to
reserve
that
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
seymour
m.
waldman
i
can't
do
too
much
in
a
minute
but
may
i
just
make
these
brief
points.
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
the
question
about
handling
of
lines.
mr.
leslie
's
memory
failed
him
because
of
the
deposition
of
mr.
kaine's
in
the
eastern
case,
not
in
this
case
and
i
don't
think
it
is
properly
before
the
court,
but
it
is
there
on
pages
12
and
13
of
that
deposition.
mr.
kaine
said,
“the
handling
of
lines
is
done
by
a
shore
side
employees;
not
by
ship's
crew
by
a
shore
gang”
so
that
is
in
the
record
of
the
eastern
case.
but
this
kaine
deposition
baffles
me.
this
is
a
deposition
taken
in
a
lawyer's
office
in
another
case
that
apparently
somehow
is
filed
in
this
case;
i
can't
see
the
slightest
procedural
way
that
it
ever
came
to
the
attention
of
the
court
in
this
case.
i
see
no
reference
to
it
in
any
motion
preserving
order,
statement
by
the
court
or
by
counsel,
i
don't
think
the
judge
was
ever
aware
of
it,
i
don't
see
how
any
counsel
can
argue
to
a
court
let
alone
the
supreme
court
that
facts
are
established
by
a
deposition
taken
in
another
case
by
a
lawyer
in
his
office
that
never
comes
to
the
attention
of
a
court.
your
honors
i
won't
trespass
any
further.
thank
you.
