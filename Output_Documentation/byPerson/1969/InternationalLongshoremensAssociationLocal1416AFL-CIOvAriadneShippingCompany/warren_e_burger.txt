you

does
that
claim
depend
upon
whether
this
record
does
or
does
not
show
the
participation
in
longshoremen
work
by
american
nationals
not
part
of
the
ship's
crew?
chief
justice
warren
e.

in
other
words,
foreign-flag
ship
can't
bring
its
own
longshoremen
as
part
of
the
ship's
company
and
escape
the
reach
of

very
well
mr.
waldman,
thank
you.
mr.
leslie
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're

now
where
--
excuse
me
counselor,
are
you
in
the
appendix
on

53?
chief

where
is
it?
chief

e.

it's
not
a
printed
record
is
it?
chief

warren
e.
burger
but
not
in
the
appendix?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
doing
so,
you
may
represent
properly
only
matters
which
are
in
the
record
itself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
page
in
the
appendix
again?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
you
go
outside
the
record,
i
remind
you
again
it
must
be
within
the
four
corners
of
this
transcript
or
else
we
don't
want
you
to
go
outside
the
record.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
mr.
leslie
if
you
will
look
at
the
52
(a)
which
i
believe
is
what
mr.
justice
white
is
looking
at,
the
florida
court
did
not
say
that
there
was
any
evidence
of
american
residents.
they
said
the
union
was
attempting
to
inform
the
public
that
there
were
american
residents
involved.
it
is
not
a
suggestion
of
fact
but
merely
a
statement
of
what
the
union
was
claiming
to
be
the
fact
that
justifies
it's
picketing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
don't
know
that
it's
relevant
mr.
leslie
,
but
it
is
not
unknown
for
a
ship
in
considering
itself
in
a
hostile
port
so
send
a
line
crew
aboard
by
attainder,
ashore
by
attainder.
now,
i
don't
suppose
we
can
speculate
on
that
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course
mr.
waldman
did
not
agree
with
that.
mr.
waldman
said
if
you
bring
your
own
longshoremen
your
still
--
those
longshoremen
are
subject
to
the
act.
chief
