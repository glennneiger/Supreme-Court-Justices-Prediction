justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
claim
that
the
crew
is
doing
longshoremen's
work
or
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
some
independent
shore
based
crew?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
claim
that
even
if
it
was
the
ship
based
crew
that
was
doing
this
work
that
there
is
preemption?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
side
of
incres
in
those
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
about
the
third
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
say
do
you
--
do
you
challenge
the
injunction
in
its
entirety?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
paragraph
of
the
injunction
that
are
considered
to
be
valid?
justice
byron
r.
white
one
and
two,
and
you
challenge
both
three
and
four?
justice
byron

white
what
if
paragraph
four
was
not
annulled?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
get
it
straight
you
--
i
thought
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
this
picketing
was
as
far
as
this
record
shows
on
the
evidence
was
directed
in
both
the
ship's
crew
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
third
party
longshoremen
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
both.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
you
don't
agree
mr.
waldman
or
maybe
i
misread
this
footnote
six
in
the
government's
brief.
the
government's
brief
--
justice
byron
r.
white
says
here,
“american
longshoremen
will
locally
hire
to
do
the
longshore
work
and
the
union
was
seeking
to
carry
its
dispute
to
them.”
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
already
answered
this
mr.
waldman,
but
let
me
ask
it
again?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
the
ship's
crew
were
the
only
ones
doing
this
longshore
work
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it'd
still
be
here
with
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
you're
wrong
on
that,
that
and
it
was
only
the
ship's
crew,
there
is
no
preemption
on
your
inquest
in
those
cases.
assume
that
that
is
the
law,
then,
what
would
should
be
the
result
if
both
the
ship's
crew
and
third
parties
are
being
picketed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
waldman
for
that
extent,
then
do
you--
you
do
agree
with
this
sentence
in
footnote
6
to
the
government's
brief,
were
there
any
risk
of
improperly
involving
the
ship's
crew
that
could
be
accommodated
in
the
first
instance
by
the
board
in
any
proceedings
before
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
too,
but
i
am
dismissed
here
--
justice
byron
r.
white
with
that
assumption
but
a
mixed
mixture
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
sounds
like
the
factual
matters
aren't
very
well
taken
care
off,
but
we
have
to
disagree
with
you
on
what
the
results
should
be
if
with
respect
to
a
ship's
crew
doing
longshoremen's
work,
wouldn't
there
have
to
be
some
clarification
in
the
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
pardon
me
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
question
and
answer
to
the
top
of
45?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
right
now
because
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
in
connection
with
the
ariadne?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
the
testimony
outside
labor
and
i
didn't
see
--
i
didn't
see
that
you
are
going
to
be
used
testimony
the
--
to
contradiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
--
what
did
the
state
court
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
that
--
where
is
it
that
the
state
court
say
there
was
no
outside
labor?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
any
of
the
residents
of
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
they're
all
board
or
any
of
them
reside
in
this
country?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
none
of
the
citizens
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
opinion
as
the
florida
district
court
of
appeals
says
that
the
facts
tended
to
show
the
following
that
the
union
was
attempting
to
inform
the
public
that
the
american
residents
who
were
working
on
the
cruise
ships
were
being
paid
substandard
wages?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
if
they
are
referring
not
to
the
room
stores
or
anybody
but
i
think
that
they're
referring
to
some
american
residents
who
are
doing
longshoremen's
work.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
i
don't
--
but
here's
the
florida
court
they
say
we've
look
to
the
testimony,
the
testimony
tends
to
show
the
following
that
there
were
american
residents
working
on
the
cruise
ships.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
it
though
that
they
couldn't
have
been
saying
suggesting
that
part
of
the
crew
that
some
members
of
the
crew
were
american
residents.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
deny
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
claim
that
the
crew
is
doing
longshoremen's
work
or
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
some
independent
shore
based
crew?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
claim
that
even
if
it
was
the
ship
based
crew
that
was
doing
this
work
that
there
is
preemption?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
side
of
incres
in
those
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
about
the
third
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
say
do
you
--
do
you
challenge
the
injunction
in
its
entirety?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
paragraph
of
the
injunction
that
are
considered
to
be
valid?
justice
byron
r.
white
one
and
two,
and
you
challenge
both
three
and
four?
justice
byron

white
what
if
paragraph
four
was
not
annulled?
