there
maybe
one
remaining
issue
may
their
not
which
you
assume
to
be
resolved
and
assume
to
be
a
fact,
and
that
is
that
longshoremen's
work
is
involved
here.
now,
as
i
understand
as
they
claim
these
ships
carry
no
freight,
no
cargo,
no
automobiles
anymore,
and
that
what's
involved
here
is
simply
carrying
passenger
suitcases
onboard,
didn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
may
there
not
be
an
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
that
is
traditionally
work
of
the
crew,
the
purser
staff
and
so
on
of
ship
or
whether
it
is
necessarily
longshoreman's
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
line
handling?
line
handling
is
traditionally
longshore
work?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
just
couldn't
physically
be
--
have
been
done
by
members
of
the
crew
because
they
couldn't
get
back
aboard?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
a
mere
claim
however
doesn't
take
jurisdiction
away
from
the
courts,
does
it?
i
mean
that
would
violate
everything
that
the
incres
case
and
its
companion's
stand
point
which
is
the
labor
board
doesn't
have
any
jurisdiction
whatsoever
over
the
seagoing
crew
of
foreign-flag
ships.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
think
so
far
as
the
other
crew
of
the
ships.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
mere
claim
that
they
are
doing
some
sort
of
work
that
somewhere
in
the
united
states
is
done
by
somebody
else
except
for
the
cruise
ships
doesn't
take
all
jurisdiction
away
from
the
courts
i
should
say.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
no
such
thing.
justice
potter
stewart
the
only
problem
that
the
government's
brief
and
in
it
stating
the
facts
as
it
does
in
footnote
6
is
that
it
was
filed
many
days
before
the
respondent's
brief
and
the
government
wasn't
aware
of
the
claims,
at
least
that
the
respondent
was
going
to
make
in
it's
brief
about
that
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
where
are
the
facts
in
the
records?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
where
confined
to
the
facts
of
record
and
what
we
--
justice
potter
stewart
made
traditionally
know
which
isn't
very
much
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
up
to
the
parties
to
get
to
the
end
of
the
appendix
what
they
want
to
bring
to
the
attention
to
the
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
if
you
also
relied
with
the
court
but
it
does.
i
have
met
the
rules
before
me
but
as
i
have
--
because
i
have
them
in
mind
and
recollect
them,
those
rules
may
can
come
that
upon
the
parties
to
put
in
to
this
printed
appendix
such
parts
of
the
record
that
the
parties,
they
want
to
bring
before
the
court.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
leslie
,
if
i
can
interrupt
you
a
moment.
i
didn't
get
the
--
you
are
interested
in
telling
us
all
the
facts
that
record
pointing
out,
all
the
facts
of
the
record
and
you
referred
to
pages
in
the
original
record
showing
that
there
was
no
outside
labor
involved
here.
i
am
afraid
i
did
get
those
pages.
i
have
the
original
record
here
in
front
of
me
now
and
i
will
be
interested
in
getting.
justice
potter
stewart
plot
wise,
the
only
testimony?
justice
potter
stewart
plot
wise,
where
does
it
appear?
justice
potter
stewart
but
where
can
i
find
it
that
you
say
is
the
only
testimony
as
to
outside
labor?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
well
i
have
seen
that.
justice
potter
stewart
i've
seen
that.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
that's
not
my
question
to
you
at
all.
my
question
is
this.
you
began
early
in
your
argument
by
saying
that
telling
us
that
the
record,
the
original
record
and
here
it
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
shows
that
in
fact
there
was
no
outside
labor
and
i
simply
didn't
get
the
pages
of
the
original
record
to
which
you
refer
this.
i
am
interested
in
getting
those
copies.
justice
potter
stewart
28
and
29?
justice
potter
stewart
but
now,
which
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
page
28
and
29
and
pages
53
and
54?
justice
potter
stewart
now
that
past
information
i
have
has
one.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
are
referring
me
to
the
same
thing;
28
and
29
is
the
same
thing
that
i
defined
on
53
and
54.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
28
and
29
of
the
original
deposition
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
is
53
and
54
of
the
original
record?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
have
it
here.
i
just
wanted
to
get
the
pages.
that's
all.
justice
potter
stewart
who
handles
the
lines
on
the
dock
when
the
ship?
justice
potter
stewart
for
where?
justice
potter
stewart
well
with
respect
to
this
question
i
just
asked
you,
it
couldn't
possibly
be
aboard
ship.
justice
potter
stewart
because
if
you
are
aboard
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
ship,
you
can't
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
be
on
the
dock
and
somebody
has
to
be
on
the
dock
to
handle
the
lines?
justice
potter
stewart
be
very
in
most
rig
and
dig
corporation
to
do
that.
justice
potter
stewart
there
maybe
one
remaining
issue
may
their
not
which
you
assume
to
be
resolved
and
assume
to
be
a

and
that
is
that
