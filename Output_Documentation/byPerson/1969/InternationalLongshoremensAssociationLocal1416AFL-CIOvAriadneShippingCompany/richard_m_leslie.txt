mr.
richard
m.
leslie
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
justices;
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
no
longshoring
here.
there
is
no
cargo
here.
there
wasn't
in
1966,
there
isn't
in
1970
and
if
there
was
cargo
here,
if
there
were
cars
here,
we'd
have
a
different
case.
in
fact,
we
might
even
go
so
far
to
say
maybe
the
injunction
should
be
dissolved
unless
you
want
to
increase
incres.
these
aren't
the
facts
before
this
court.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
all
right,
well
that's
what
i
want
to
point
out
mr.
justice
stewart.
since
i
have
had
the
privilege
to
represent
this
client
since
the
first
day
which
was
the
23rd
of
may
in
1966,
the
virtue
who
verified
complaint,
i
feel
it's
my
obligation
to
this
court
to
state
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
and
to
avoid
any
risk
that
this
court
could
be
misled
into
a
ruling
on
a
basis
of
inaccurate
facts.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
all
right,
let
me
start
with
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
all
right,
let
me
start
with
tim
kaine's
deposition.
this
is
a
record
at
page
53-54.
tim
kaine
is
a
vice
president
of
eastern
steamship
line.
now,
this
is
in
this
case
before
you.
it's
mr.
gutman
who
had
been
the
union
attorney
all
the
way
through
asking
about
the
loading
and
unloading,
and
he
says
in
the
middle
of
the
page
about
the
ship's
crew
with
the
bahama
star,
what
else
do
they
do?
and
it
goes
on
to
say
that
the
ship's
crews
are
employed
to
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
no,
no.
i'm
in
the
record
on
page
53-54.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
inadvertently,
i
can't
understand
this.
but
inadvertently,
the
deposition
was
left
out
in
the
appendix,
this
whole
deposition
testimony,
although
you'll
find
it
related
in
the
record.
the
entire
25
--
35
pages
of
questions
by
mr.
gutman
of
mr.
kaine
have
been
left
out
of
the
appendix,
but
they
are
in
the
record.
and
let
me
read
you
from
that
because
this
is
extraordinarily
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
i
beg
your
pardon.
in
the
printed
record
before
this
court,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
it's
not
in
the
appendix
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
--
and
i
didn't
realize
that
before
--
until
i
got
before
you
all
today
that
that
somehow
was
omitted,
it
must
have
just
have
been
an
error
in
my
part
because
i
didn't
put
together
the
appendix.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that's
right
your
honor
but
i
understand
mr.
justice
stewart,
according
to
the
rules
that
it
is
still
before
the
court,
even
if
not
including
appendix.
i
believe
if
you
also
obtain
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
well
respectfully
your
honor,
i
check
that
rule
because
i
saw
that
this
wasn't
here
in
the
rule
17
on
page
15
of
the
supreme
court
rules
and
it
says
that
everything
in
the
record
is
before
this
court.
but
that's
why
i
want
to
tell
you
what
the
facts
are
because
this
has
been
found
three
times
as
to
this
no
cargo,
no
cars
and
therefore
no
longshoring.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
surely
your
honor,
and
that
is
why
i
put
the
record
at
pages
53
and
54
which
at
pages
28
and
29
of
the
original
transcript
which
i
have
and
be
reading
from
and
unfortunately,
i
have
not
done
it.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
yes,
it
is
your
honor
because
it
is
in
the
record
of
this
case.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
yes
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that
part
unfortunately
was
not
printed
with
the
appendix.
it
is
on
file
but
not
printed
with
the
appendix.
and
mr.
gutman
ask
exactly
what
the
crews
do
and
they
went
on
and
said
about
the
passenger
baggage
and
told
about
that
area
and
the
record
page
54,
page
29,
they
asked,
“what
else
that
ship's
crew
does?”
and
they
say,
“some
are
employed
the
load
stores.”
he
said,
“does
that
include
food?”
and
he
said,
“yes.”
question,
“is
that
all
sir?”
“that
is
all.”
now,
that's
the
point
we're
trying
to
make
because
mr.
gutman,
the
union
attorney,
knew
this
very
well
because
this
is
on
this
record
on
the
16th
of
august,
1966.
he
recalled
this
case
started
with
our
injunction
in
may
of
1966.
but
even
before
that,
there
was
a
case
called
easter
versus
longshoremen.
same
ships,
same
facts.
and
that
same
facts
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
right.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that's
true.
the
ship's
crew
does
that.
they
take
aboard
the
provisions
of
the
ship;
no
doubt
about
it.
and
they
also
handle
the
baggage;
no
doubt
about
that.
but
that's
why
i'm
pointing
out
on
these
three
different
occasions
not
only
this
time,
but
three
days
before
this
court
in
eastern
and
that
is
why
i
put
that
in
my
brief
because
it
was
laid
out
so
clearly
there.
in
there
when
mr.
gutman
asked
the
question
about
cargo,
he
was
told
by
the
same
man
again
under
oath,
no
cargo
at
all.
answer,
“no,
mr.
gutman
has
no
cargo
at
all.”
question,
“on
either
vessel?”
answer,
“either
vessel.”
question,
“do
you
load
or
ship
automobiles?”
“no,
sir
not
anymore,
i
haven't
done
it
for
a
long
time.”
“you
used
to?”
“don't
take
charge
either
way.”
now,
there
was
a
third
time
that
mr.
gutman
and
i
won't
bore
the
court
with
the
details,
but
there
was
a
third
time
that
this
man
was
on
a
deposition
again
that
was
june
'66,
may,
june
and
august,
and
he
was
asked
again
about
cargo
and
again,
there
was
nothing
there.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
no
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
no
sir
and
i
would
like
to
read
that
testimony
because
i
think
that
is
very
important.
in
the
transcript,
the
hearing,
now
this
is
44
(a)
of
the
appendix.
it
starts
with
cleveland
turner
being
sworn.
apparently,
this
is
somewhat
of
an
omission
here
too
because
the
first
thing
that
mr.
gutman
asked
was
permission
to
proffer
this
testimony,
but
then
mr.
turner
was
sworn
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
44.
and
when
--
and
let
me
give
you
one
further
fact
on
this
that
is
going
to
be
helpful
in
your
understanding
of
what
this
testimony
is.
there
where
at
that
time
two
ships
involved,
the
bahama
star
which
sailed
out
of
miami,
that
is
dade
county,
florida.
the
ariadne,
which
is
what's
before
you
now,
bahama
star
no
longer
operates.
it's
not
owned
by
this
company,
it's
not
even
here.
the
ariadne
operates
out
of
fort
lauderdale,
broward
county,
port
everglades,
25
miles
apart
and
i
point
that
out
because
when
you
seer
what
mr.
turner
who
newly
took
over
this
union,
apparently,
he
succeeded
the
judge
henderson.
you'll
see
that
his
testimony
is
only
as
to
miami
and
it's
only
as
to
the
type
of
picketing.
he's
asked
at
the
bottom
of
page
44
specifically
what
type
of
work
were
you
interested
in.
he
wasn't
asked
what
work
was
done
on
that
ship.
he
wasn't
asked
whether
there
was
cargo
or
cars,
but
what
type
of
work
were
you
interested
in.
and
he
says
the
loading
of
the
ship;
stowage,
loading
of
automobiles,
loading
of
cargo,
ship
stowage.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
45
he
says,
where
these
performed
by
employees
of
the
ship?
part
of
it
by
employees
of
the
ship
and
some
of
it
but
outside
labor.
these
words
outside
labor
are
the
only
words
that
give
comfort
to
the
union's
position.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
all
right.
well,
let
me
answer
that.
that's
why
i
pointed
out
fort
lauderdale
and
miami.
if
you'll
notice,
i
only
asked
him
a
few
questions
because
i
saw
he
had
his
days
mixed
up
and
i
went
down
in
here
and
this
is
question
in
the
middle
of
the
page
and
i
said,
“that's
the
one
you've
been
enjoined”,
i
mean
enjoining
the
other
cases.
“i
mean
did
you
have
a
sign
saying
the
area
and
they
paid
substandard
wages.”
“monday
i
didn't,
but
i
had
on
the
ship
monday
in
miami.”
he
means
the
bahama
star.
this
is
the
first
time
we
ever
heard
of
wages.
our
compliant
asked
for
an
injunction
as
to
safety.
but
even
there,
it
shows
that
this,
the
bahama
star
in
miami,
25
miles
different
from
port
everglades
and
the
ariadne.
as
far
as
we
know,
there
was
never
a
sign
of
this.
but
what
we're
trying
to
say
is
this
outside
labor
is
not
the
fact
in
this
case,
and
i
go
so
far
to
say
if
there's
a
question
outside
labor,
if
you
think
that
we
hire
people
to
do
it,
then
that's
why
i
said
since
i
have
been
it
since
1966,
i
have
to
bring
the
true
facts
to
you
at
the
risk
of
going
outside
the
record,
of
course
with
your
permission.
but
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
but
mr.
chief
justice,
what
i
mean
is
if
you
think
there
is
outside
labor
here,
we'd
ask
that
the
case
be
remanded
for
further
testimony.
there
is
not
outside
labor
here.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
in
connection
with
either
ships.
i
pointed
out
with
ariadne
here
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
frankly
your
honor,
we
didn't
because
it
has
never
been
raised
until
we
came
up
here
because
there
was
never
any
question
in
the
counsel's
mind
who
was
in
miami,
nor
in
the
judge's
mind.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that's
why
i'd
like
to
further
go
with
the
sequence
so
you
see
what
happened
in
this
case.
after
we
are
at
temporary
injunction
which
of
course
is
a
fairly
quick
proceeding,
then,
and
this
is
a
verified
complaint
by
the
way
your
honors.
it
wasn't
as
if
there
was
no
evidence
before
the
court,
and
the
answer
which
came
a
few
weeks
later
while
after
the
order
was
entered
was
not
verified.
it
was
just
the
denial.
but
when
it
went
to
the
appellate
court,
the
appellate
court
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
the
same
facts
that
there
was
no
outside
labor
and
this
is
what
we
have
argued
all
the
way
through.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
i
couldn't
pull
it
out
of
the
decision.
but
as
my
understanding
from
arguing
the
case
that
they
accepted
opposition,
i
can't
point
to
a
word
in
there
where
they
said
there
is
no
outside
labor
involved.
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
if
i
did.
but
then
this
case
came
back
again,
and
it
came
back
again
under
our
summary
judgment
procedure
when
we
asked
for
a
temporary
injunction.
we
asked
for
temporary
injunction
in
may
of
‘66
and
then
a
permanent
injunction
march
31,
1967,
nine
months
later.
under
our
procedure,
we
have
to
allow
a
minimal
of
20
days
for
hearings.
we
have
to
allow
the
other
side
to
put
in
affidavits.
if
there
was
any
cargo,
if
there
are
any
automobiles,
if
there
was
any
outside
labor
certainly
of
the
side
that
had
lost,
the
union
would
bring
this
in.
but
there
were
no
further
facts
because
these
have
never
been
argued,
because
at
that
time,
we
were
only
talking
safety.
if
you
notice
the
hand
billing
in
there,
that
says
the
safety.
wages
never
came
up
until
a
cold
record
was
read,
that's
why
i
said
i
felt
that
my
obligation
since
i
had
started
this
case
in
1966
to
try
and
tell
you
all
of
the
facts.
now,
this
is
march
31,
1967.
the
order
for
a
permanent
injunction
isn't
until
may
1,
1967
almost
11
months.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
no
your
honor.
what
i
said
or
what
i
meant
to
say
if
i
misunderstood
--
if
i
didn't
express
myself
clearly
was
that
this
was
the
only
testimony
as
to
outside
labor.
this
gentleman,
mr.
turner
said
outside
labor,
those
words
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that
was
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
oh,
it's
his
testimony
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
his
testimony
is
in
the
appendix
on
page
45.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
where
he
says
some
but
--
by
outside
labor.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that's
all.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
right.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
no
sir.
i
meant
to
say
there
was
no
cargo,
there
was
no
cars,
and
i
took
that
on
the
original
record
from
what
i
have
as
page
28
and
29
which
is
the
record
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
--
which
is
the
record
page
53-54.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
both
of
those
pages.
that
is
the
two
pages
that
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that's
right.
i
think
i
just
right
you
down
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
--
28
and
29
of
the
original
deposition.
that
is
the
record,
pages
53
and
54.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that
is
right.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
right,
which
i
just
respectfully
can't
explain
why
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
all
right.
but
our
point
is
since
we
have
this
all
the
through,
three
times
that
there
were
no
cars,
no
cargo,
there
is
no
longshoring.
there's
no
one
to
hire
and
what
is
before
this
court
is
basically
the
case
as
it
was
before
incres,
and
i
would
like
to
go
down
some
more
of
the
factual
part
to
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
your
honor,
there
is
no
machinery
in
the
dock.
there's
no
man
to
handle
it.
there
are
no
hoists
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
respectfully,
i
don't
know
where
that
is,
i
know
of
no
such
machinery.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
there
are
no
hoist,
there
are
no
cranes,
there
is
no
cargo
hatches.
these
are
three
and
four
day
cruises
to
nassau
and
sometimes
await
cruise
to
the
various
ports
there.
but
what
i
want
to
show
again
about
the
time
sequence
was
the
injunction
may
of
'66,
the
summary
judgment
asking
for
a
permanent
injunction
in
'67,
11
months
later.
when
he
grants
this,
when
judge
lee
grants
this
may
1,
1967,
then
the
union
has
10
days
to
ask
for
rehearing.
they
did
this,
that's
may
9,
1967.
it
went
all
the
way
until
september
1967,
16
months
later
before
the
rehearing
was
denied.
again,
no
affidavit
by
the
union,
no
fact;
no
fact
of
cars,
cargo,
outside
labor.
what
we
are
saying
is
the
only
words
in
here
that
this
case
could
be
reversed
on
respectfully
are
cleveland
turners
words
on
page
45,
some
of
it
by
outside
labor.
he
didn't
say
american
residence,
he
didn't
say
union,
he
didn't
say
non-union,
he
said
outside
labor.
all
the
way
to
here
in
for
years,
there's
been
no
contention
on
this
because
those
are
the
facts,
and
that's
why
i
went
so
far
opening
statement
to
say
if
you
had
any
idea
these
were
the
facts,
remand
this
case
for
testimony.
i'll
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
if
we've
carried
a
car
in
four
years
dissolve
injunction
as
the
cars,
if
we've
carried
cargo,
it
doesn't
happen.
we
are
talking
about
15
room
stewards
on
the
ariadne.
these
people
stay
with
the
passengers
throughout
the
trip.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
they
are
all
foreign
crew
members.
as
far
as
these
room
stewards
go
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
none
of
the
room
stewards
and
i
cannot
relate
every
crew
member.
some
of
the
other
crewmembers
might.
it's
nowhere
in
the
record.
it's
only
that
they're
totally
foreign
crews.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
i
don't
think
so,
but
i
hesitate
on
that
because
that
has
never
been
raised
because
they
were
under
the
liberian
articles
and
they
were
signed
as
foreign
crewmen
and
they
worked
as
foreign
crewmen.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
all
i
can
say
is
they
adopted
the
union
position
and
they
adopted
the
words
american
residents.
you'll
never
see
the
words
american
residents
in
this
transcript.
i
mean
in
the
record
anyway.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
well,
we
could
never
explain
that.
all
i
can
say
as
they
said
those
words.
it's
not
in
the
record.
their
decision
as
has
been
all
the
way
through
five
court's
now.
i
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
if
they
were
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
if
they
were,
they
were
guessing.
all
i
checked
so
i
could
represent
this
to
you
because
it's
not
in
the
record
was
these
15
room
stewards.
they're
foreign.
i
didn't
check
every
one
of
the
--
i
think
it
is
180
crew
members
to
see
if
they're
foreign.
they
all
were
hired
foreign
as
foreign
crew
members;
they
are
all
under
foreign
articles.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
apparently,
the
union
has
said
that
your
honor.
we
find
that
nowhere
in
the
record,
we
don't
think
it's
factual.
it's
just
as
the
union
has
said
throughout
that
there
were
american
longshoremen,
but
those
words
are
never
in
the
record.
they're
relying
on
the
two
words
outside
labor
by
cleveland
turner
who
we
say
is
mistaken.
we're
saying
that
the
judge
on
a
verified
complaint
saying
this
was
a
passenger
ship
and
on
the
testimony
of
deposition
of
tim
kaine
that
all
the
crew
was
doing
was
baggage
and
ship
stores
that
this
is
enough
to
sustain
in
our
position.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
well,
that
was
interesting
mr.
justice
stewart
when
you
ask
that
because
there
has
never
been
any
handling
of
lines
in
the
case.
i
have
no
ideas.
i
agree
with
you.
somebody
have
to
do
it
from
there.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
but
my
note
on
when
you
asked
that
question
before
and
the
opposing
counsel
replied
is
that
there
is
no
handling
of
lines.
i
don't
know.
i
am
sure
lines
are
throwing
off.
if
they're
throwing
off
the
longshoremen,
i
don't
know.
it's
certainly
never
been
in
our
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact
right
before
that
as
long
as
i'm
addressing
this
to
your
honor,
you
hit
the
what
we
thought
was
the
point
of
our
case
exactly
was
that
here
as
an
interest.
you
have
a
foreign
crew
doing
acts
and
there
is
never
been
any
doubt
of
that,
and
the
only
acts
of
their
doing
that
could
be
in
contention
are
the
50-feet
that
they
move
the
baggage
from
the
customs
area
to
the
gangway,
everything
else
was
aboard
ship.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
i
agree.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
they
have
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
--
to
leap
off
the
ship.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that's
never
come
up
in
this
case,
but
i
agree
there
must
be
someone
in
the
dock.
i
don't
sell
it
could
be
ship's
crew.
well,
they
theoretically
sure
they
could
because
we
have
a
long
pile
of
both,
they
could
go
in
that
way,
but
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
all
right.
i
just
--
i
don't
think
its'
possible.
i
think
what
have
to
be
somewhere
or
other
than
the
ship's
crew.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
no
that
was
point
respectfully
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
we
can't
speculate
on
that.
but,
this
isn't
a
hostile
port.
this
is
work
that
has
always
been
done
by
these
people.
i
heard
the
comments
of
counsel
about
what
happened
in
europe
and
other
places.
it
doesn't
happen
here,
and
that's
why
i
want
to
tell
this
court
what
these
room
stewards
do.
when
someone
comes
to
the
ship,
they
buy
a
ticket
and
they
are
on
a
dock
there,
and
they
have
hand
baggage.
they
don't
have
steamer
trunks,
they
are
not
going
to
europe,
and
this
room
steward
comes
down
asking
what
room
their
in
and
he
carries
their
bags
to
50-feet,
that's
in
this
record
that
tim
kaine
testified
to,
the
50-feet
from
a
customs
area
to
the
gangway,
up
the
gangway
into
their
room.
the
same
room
steward
is
with
these
people
throughout
the
trip.
he
moves
the
bags
when
they
get
ready
to
get
off,
whether
it's
in
nassau
or
foreign
port,
to
the
rail
and
down
on
the
gangway,
and
then
maybe
50-feet
in
the
customs
area.
nobody
else
goes
into
the
customs
area.
there
just
isn't
any
longshoring
in
this
case.
well,
i've
heard
longshoring
out
my
ears
and
there
isn't
any
longshoring.
there
aren't
any
cargo
carriers.
there
isn't
any
longshore
of
men
employed,
and
i
don't
mean
to
make
that
point
so
strongly
and
i
would
like
to
go
down
some
of
the
points
that
were
raised
in
opposing
counsel's
argument.
when
mr.
chief
justice
burger
asked,
he
received
this
comment
from
counsel
that
foreign-flag
ships
can
bring
their
own
longshoreman
and
avoid
the
board.
well,
if
he
will
agree
to
that,
heavens,
we
haven't
even
done
that.
we've
just
brought
our
crew.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
oh,
i
misunderstood
of
him
because
that's
even
further
than
we
would
go.
we
just
have
a
crew.
it
does
one
thing.
it
takes
orders
from
its
foreign
officers
who
tell
it
its
responsibilities.
and
unlike
american
crews,
it
works
probably
a
longer
day.
wages,
i
don't
know
if
these
people
get
more
or
less,
the
record
is
bear
of
this.
the
unions
never
told
you
about
wages.
they've
never
said
that
our
people
get
more
or
less.
there
are
no
facts
like
this
before
your
honors.
it's
a
guess,
a
conjecture.
i
conjecture
we
get
more.
i
don't
know.
if
these
were
the
facts
again
in
the
16
months
from
a
temporary
injunction
which
naturally
is
granted
a
little
bit
in
haste,
in
those
16
months
couldn't
some
of
these
facts
been
brought
up?
we
suggest
that
the
only
reason
why
this
case
is
here
is
that
of
a
union
says
we
have
the
titled
union
and
we
want
to
organize
people
and
therefore,
we'll
try
it
on
these
ships
in
spite
of
benz,
in
spite
of
mcculloch,
sociedad,
and
in
spite
of
incres,
and
there's
no
use
to
argue
your
honor
what
those
cases
held.
i
can
see
from
your
questions
that
they
are
even
six
years
old,
their
vivid
in
your
mind.
and
under
incres,
you
can't
do
what
they're
doing.
so
they
try
and
get
away
from
incres
and
say
this
isn't
a
ship's
crew.
this
is
longshoremen.
and
your
questions
point
that
out.
it's
not
longshoremen.
it's
the
ship's
crew
that
is
almost
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
no.
if
i
am
wrong
on
the
facts,
if
they
are
american
residents
doing
longshoring
work,
if
it's
not
the
crew,
then
i've
got
a
good
chance
to
lose.
the
only
way
i
could
win
then
is
for
you
people
to
say
as
you
said
in
incres
that
well
it
is
still
basically
a
foreign
crew.
but
that
is
why
i
go
so
far.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
exactly.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
mr.
justice
black,
what
i
would
say
to
that
is
number
one
you
take
the
verified
complaint
which
says
passenger
ships
and
this
three
or
four-day
trips
and
nothing
about
cargo
or
anything
like
that.
then
you
go
to
the
deposition
of
tim
kaine
which
is
not
nearly
as
clear
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that's
the
part
that
we
had
so
much
trouble
with
the
record
that
the
pages
20
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that's
the
pages
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that's
right,
53
and
54
of
the
record.
and
the
reason
why
i
quoted
the
other
two
types
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
yes
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
not
as
clearly
as
if
when
you
also
read
53
and
54.
you
looked
at
the
other
two
depositions
of
tim
kaine
under
oath
by
mr.
gutman
where
he
sets
his
questions
out
little
better.
you
see,
that's
why
we
pointed
out
to
this
court
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
all
right.
that
shows
that
there
was
no
cargo,
but
there
were
no
automobiles,
that
the
ship
hadn't
carried
these.
and
therefore,
there
could
be
no
longshoring
work.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
yes
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that's
right.
we
would
ask
that
if
you
did
not
affirm
this
case
that
you
remand
it
for
that
testimony
because
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
because
the
clearest
testimony
is
the
eastern
versus
ariadne
--
is
the
case
where
eastern
steamship
lines
was
against
this
union.
you
see
these
people
took
their
signs
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
yes
your
honor,
but
it
has
been
considered
by
each
of
the
courts
so
long
as
a
companion
case
and
judge
lee
when
he
decide
this
case
was
aware
of
the
eastern
case
and
stated
that
he
was
aware
of
it.
and
of
course,
it's
in
the
same
circuit
court
in
dade
county
in
the
same
court
house,
its
public
record
and
we
would
say
judicial
notice.
because
i
can't
express
this
strongly
enough,
the
signs
started
out
saying
eastern
safety
conditions.
they
pasted
over
the
sign
and
put
the
word
ariadne
and
put
the
word
bahama
star.
they
didn't
even
change
their
signs.
they
were
not
aware
of
incres,
they
were
not
aware
of
the
foreign-flag
cases.
they
said
that
they
just
have
the
wrong
defendant
when
they
had
eastern;
that's
the
ships
agent.
you
would
think
eastern
own
the
ships
probably
if
you
just
looked
at
sales
brochure
that
says
our
general
agents.
that's
why
i'm
trying
to
show
you
the
sequence
of
this
over
these
four
years
because
the
facts
are
so
clear
and
the
record
only
has
these
little
bitty
parts,
the
outside
labor
contention
that
the
union
relies
on
and
our
two
pages
of
deposition
and
our
verified
complaint.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
the
other
two
depositions
which
i
have
in
my
brief
taken
by
the
same
attorney,
mr.
gutman
for
a
union
for
the
same
man
mr.
tim
kaine,
and
that's
the
part
i
read.
no
cargo,
not
at
all.
no
cars,
not
at
all.
without
cars
and
cargo,
you
have
no
longshoring
--
mr.
justice
white
asked
in
spite
of
incres,
if
the
crew
did
this,
could
that
get
around
incres?
that's
our
point
exactly.
the
crew
is
doing
this.
you
said
in
incres,
foreign-flag
ships,
foreign
crews
that
is
a
little
area
that
has
been
carved
away.
that's
taken
out
of
the
preemption.
that's
exactly
our
position.
i
can't
even
say
it
as
well.
and
also
footnote
6
of
the
government's
brief,
we
didn't
have
the
government's
brief
when
we
wrote
our
brief,
and
consequently,
i
wrote
to
the
government
and
said
heavens,
how
can
you
write
this
kind
of
a
brief?
and
i
was
fortunate
in
getting
back
two
letters
from
the
solicitor
general
mr.
griswold
saying
if
under
footnote
6,
it
was
the
crew,
then
there
might
be
a
different
result
and
he
put
it
very,
very
clearly.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
the
two
letters
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
no
your
honor.
those
were
letters,
the
first
one
is
dates
december
30,
1969,
the
second
one
was
send
up
to
me
when
i
got
here
was
dated
january
1,
1969.
the
last
sentence
says
we
have
made
it
clear
in
footnote
6
of
our
brief
that
if
the
facts
are
as
you
have
stated
the
result
might
have
been
different.
that's
the
point
that
your
honors
brought
up
on
footnote
6.
we
say
that
is
the
case
and
we
say
it
has
been
through
five
courts,
a
judge
for
a
temporary
injunction,
an
appeal
that
for
that
same
judge
12
to
16
months
later,
another
appeal.
if
the
facts
were
different
and
i
was
on
the
losing
side,
certainly,
i
would
have
brought
in
those
facts.
but
they're
not,
and
that's
why
i
said
to
begin
with,
i
didn't
want
this
court
to
possibly
be
misled
because
it
isn't
as
clearer
record
as
it
could
be.
it
never
is
in
a
temporary
injunction.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
justices;
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
no
longshoring
here.
there
is
no
cargo
here.
there
wasn't
in
1966,
there
isn't
in
1970
and
if
there
was
cargo
here,
if
there
were
cars
here,
we'd
have
a
different
case.
in
fact,
we
might
even
go
so
far
to
say
maybe
the
injunction
should
be
dissolved
unless
you
want
to
increase
incres.
these
aren't
the
facts
before
this
court.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
all
right,
well
that's
what
i
want
to
point
out
mr.
justice
stewart.
since
i
have
had
the
privilege
to
represent
this
client
since
the
first
day
which
was
the
23rd
of
may
in
1966,
the
virtue
who
verified
complaint,
i
feel
it's
my
obligation
to
this
court
to
state
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
and
to
avoid
any
risk
that
this
court
could
be
misled
into
a
ruling
on
a
basis
of
inaccurate
facts.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
all
right,
let
me
start
with
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
all
right,
let
me
start
with
tim
kaine's
deposition.
this
is
a
record
at
page
53-54.
tim
kaine
is
a
vice
president
of
eastern
steamship
line.
now,
this
is
in
this
case
before
you.
it's
mr.
gutman
who
had
been
the
union
attorney
all
the
way
through
asking
about
the
loading
and
unloading,
and
he
says
in
the
middle
of
the
page
about
the
ship's
crew
with
the
bahama
star,
what
else
do
they
do?
and
it
goes
on
to
say
that
the
ship's
crews
are
employed
to
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
no,
no.
i'm
in
the
record

mr.
richard
m.
leslie
inadvertently,
i
can't
understand
this.
but
inadvertently,
the
deposition
was
left
out
in
the
appendix,
this
whole
deposition
testimony,
although
you'll
find
it
related
in
the
record.
the
entire
25
--
35
pages
of
questions
by
mr.
gutman
of
mr.
kaine
have
been
left
out
of
the
appendix,
but
they
are
in
the
record.
and
let
me
read
you
from
that
because
this
is
extraordinarily
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
i
beg
your
pardon.
in
the
printed
record
before
this
court,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
it's
not
in
the
appendix
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
--
and
i
didn't
realize
that
before
--
until
i
got
before
you
all
today
that
that
somehow
was
omitted,
it
must
have
just
have
been
an
error
in
my
part
because
i
didn't
put
together
the
appendix.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that's
right
your
honor
but
i
understand
mr.
justice
stewart,
according
to
the
rules
that
it
is
still
before
the
court,
even
if
not
including
appendix.
i
believe
if
you
also
obtain
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
well
respectfully
your
honor,
i
check
that
rule
because
i
saw
that
this
wasn't
here
in
the
rule
17
on
page
15
of
the
supreme
court
rules
and
it
says
that
everything
in
the
record
is
before
this
court.
but
that's
why
i
want
to
tell
you
what
the
facts
are
because
this
has
been
found
three
times
as
to
this
no
cargo,
no
cars
and
therefore
no
longshoring.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
surely
your
honor,
and
that
is
why
i
put
the
record
at
pages
53
and
54
which
at
pages
28
and
29
of
the
original
transcript
which
i
have
and
be
reading
from
and
unfortunately,
i
have
not
done
it.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
yes,
it
is
your
honor
because
it
is
in
the
record
of
this
case.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
yes
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that
part
unfortunately
was
not
printed
with
the
appendix.
it
is
on
file
but
not
printed
with
the
appendix.
and
mr.
gutman
ask
exactly
what
the
crews
do
and
they
went
on
and
said
about
the
passenger
baggage
and
told
about
that
area
and
the
record
page
54,
page
29,
they
asked,
“what
else
that
ship's
crew
does?”
and
they
say,
“some
are
employed
the
load
stores.”
he
said,
“does
that
include
food?”
and
he
said,
“yes.”
question,
“is
that
all
sir?”
“that
is
all.”
now,
that's
the
point
we're
trying
to
make
because
mr.
gutman,
the
union
attorney,
knew
this
very
well
because
this
is
on
this
record
on
the
16th
of
august,
1966.
he
recalled
this
case
started
with
our
injunction
in
may
of
1966.
but
even
before
that,
there
was
a
case
called
easter
versus
longshoremen.
same
ships,
same
facts.
and
that
same
facts
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
right.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that's
true.
the
ship's
crew
does
that.
they
take
aboard
the
provisions
of
the
ship;
no
doubt
about
it.
and
they
also
handle
the
baggage;
no
doubt
about
that.
but
that's
why
i'm
pointing
out
on
these
three
different
occasions
not
only
this
time,
but
three
days
before
this
court
in
eastern
and
that
is
why
i
put
that
in
my
brief
because
it
was
laid
out
so
clearly
there.
in
there
when
mr.
gutman
asked
the
question
about
cargo,
he
was
told
by
the
same
man
again
under
oath,
no
cargo
at
all.
answer,
“no,
mr.
gutman
has
no
cargo
at
all.”
question,
“on
either
vessel?”
answer,
“either
vessel.”
question,
“do
you
load
or
ship
automobiles?”
“no,
sir
not
anymore,
i
haven't
done
it
for
a
long
time.”
“you
used
to?”
“don't
take
charge
either
way.”
now,
there
was
a
third
time
that
mr.
gutman
and
i
won't
bore
the
court
with
the
details,
but
there
was
a
third
time
that
this
man
was
on
a
deposition
again
that
was
june
'66,
may,
june
and
august,
and
he
was
asked
again
about
cargo
and
again,
there
was
nothing
there.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
no
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
no
sir
and
i
would
like
to
read
that
testimony
because
i
think
that
is
very
important.
in
the
transcript,
the
hearing,
now
this
is
44
(a)
of
the
appendix.
it
starts
with
cleveland
turner
being
sworn.
apparently,
this
is
somewhat
of
an
omission
here
too
because
the
first
thing
that
mr.
gutman
asked
was
permission
to
proffer
this
testimony,
but
then
mr.
turner
was
sworn
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
44.
and
when
--
and
let
me
give
you
one
further
fact
on
this
that
is
going
to
be
helpful
in
your
understanding
of
what
this
testimony
is.
there
where
at
that
time
two
ships
involved,
the
bahama
star
which
sailed
out
of
miami,
that
is
dade
county,
florida.
the
ariadne,
which
is
what's
before
you
now,
bahama
star
no
longer
operates.
it's
not
owned
by
this
company,
it's
not
even
here.
the
ariadne
operates
out
of
fort
lauderdale,
broward
county,
port
everglades,
25
miles
apart
and
i
point
that
out
because
when
you
seer
what
mr.
turner
who
newly
took
over
this
union,
apparently,
he
succeeded
the
judge
henderson.
you'll
see
that
his
testimony
is
only
as
to
miami
and
it's
only
as
to
the
type
of
picketing.
he's
asked
at
the
bottom
of
page
44
specifically
what
type
of
work
were
you
interested
in.
he
wasn't
asked
what
work
was
done
on
that
ship.
he
wasn't
asked
whether
there
was
cargo
or
cars,
but
what
type
of
work
were
you
interested
in.
and
he
says
the
loading
of
the
ship;
stowage,
loading
of
automobiles,
loading
of
cargo,
ship
stowage.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
45
he
says,
where
these
performed
by
employees
of
the
ship?
part
of
it
by
employees
of
the
ship
and
some
of
it
but
outside
labor.
these
words
outside
labor
are
the
only
words
that
give
comfort
to
the
union's
position.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
all
right.
well,
let
me
answer
that.
that's
why
i
pointed
out
fort
lauderdale
and
miami.
if
you'll
notice,
i
only
asked
him
a
few
questions
because
i
saw
he
had
his
days
mixed
up
and
i
went
down
in
here
and
this
is
question
in
the
middle
of
the
page
and
i
said,
“that's
the
one
you've
been
enjoined”,
i
mean
enjoining
the
other
cases.
“i
mean
did
you
have
a
sign
saying
the
area
and
they
paid
substandard
wages.”
“monday
i
didn't,
but
i
had
on
the
ship
monday
in
miami.”
he
means
the
bahama
star.
this
is
the
first
time
we
ever
heard
of
wages.
our
compliant
asked
for
an
injunction
as
to
safety.
but
even
there,
it
shows
that
this,
the
bahama
star
in
miami,
25
miles
different
from
port
everglades
and
the
ariadne.
as
far
as
we
know,
there
was
never
a
sign
of
this.
but
what
we're
trying
to
say
is
this
outside
labor
is
not
the
fact
in
this
case,
and
i
go
so
far
to
say
if
there's
a
question
outside
labor,
if
you
think
that
we
hire
people
to
do
it,
then
that's
why
i
said
since
i
have
been
it
since
1966,
i
have
to
bring
the
true
facts
to
you
at
the
risk
of
going
outside
the
record,
of
course
with
your
permission.
but
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
but
mr.
chief
justice,
what
i
mean
is
if
you
think
there
is
outside
labor
here,
we'd
ask
that
the
case
be
remanded
for
further
testimony.
there
is
not
outside
labor
here.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
in
connection
with
either
ships.
i
pointed
out
with
ariadne
here
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
frankly
your
honor,
we
didn't
because
it
has
never
been
raised
until
we
came
up
here
because
there
was
never
any
question
in
the
counsel's
mind
who
was
in
miami,
nor
in
the
judge's
mind.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that's
why
i'd
like
to
further
go
with
the
sequence
so
you
see
what
happened
in
this
case.
after
we
are
at
temporary
injunction
which
of
course
is
a
fairly
quick
proceeding,
then,
and
this
is
a
verified
complaint
by
the
way
your
honors.
it
wasn't
as
if
there
was
no
evidence
before
the
court,
and
the
answer
which
came
a
few
weeks
later
while
after
the
order
was
entered
was
not
verified.
it
was
just
the
denial.
but
when
it
went
to
the
appellate
court,
the
appellate
court
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
the
same
facts
that
there
was
no
outside
labor
and
this
is
what
we
have
argued
all
the
way
through.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
i
couldn't
pull
it
out
of
the
decision.
but
as
my
understanding
from
arguing
the
case
that
they
accepted
opposition,
i
can't
point
to
a
word
in
there
where
they
said
there
is
no
outside
labor
involved.
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
if
i
did.
but
then
this
case
came
back
again,
and
it
came
back
again
under
our
summary
judgment
procedure
when
we
asked
for
a
temporary
injunction.
we
asked
for
temporary
injunction
in
may
of
‘66
and
then
a
permanent
injunction
march
31,
1967,
nine
months
later.
under
our
procedure,
we
have
to
allow
a
minimal
of
20
days
for
hearings.
we
have
to
allow
the
other
side
to
put
in
affidavits.
if
there
was
any
cargo,
if
there
are
any
automobiles,
if
there
was
any
outside
labor
certainly
of
the
side
that
had
lost,
the
union
would
bring
this
in.
but
there
were
no
further
facts
because
these
have
never
been
argued,
because
at
that
time,
we
were
only
talking
safety.
if
you
notice
the
hand
billing
in
there,
that
says
the
safety.
wages
never
came
up
until
a
cold
record
was
read,
that's
why
i
said
i
felt
that
my
obligation
since
i
had
started
this
case
in
1966
to
try
and
tell
you
all
of
the
facts.
now,
this
is
march
31,
1967.
the
order
for
a
permanent
injunction
isn't
until
may
1,
1967
almost
11
months.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
no
your
honor.
what
i
said
or
what
i
meant
to
say
if
i
misunderstood
--
if
i
didn't
express
myself
clearly
was
that
this
was
the
only
testimony
as
to
outside
labor.
this
gentleman,
mr.
turner
said
outside
labor,
those
words
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that
was
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
oh,
it's
his
testimony
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
his
testimony
is
in
the
appendix
on
page
45.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
where
he
says
some
but
--
by
outside
labor.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that's
all.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
right.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
no
sir.
i
meant
to
say
there
was
no
cargo,
there
was
no
cars,
and
i
took
that
on
the
original
record
from
what
i
have
as
page
28
and
29
which
is
the
record
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
--
which
is
the
record
page
53-54.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
both
of
those
pages.
that
is
the
two
pages
that
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that's
right.
i
think
i
just
right
you
down
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
--
28
and
29
of
the
original
deposition.
that
is
the
record,
pages
53
and
54.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that
is
right.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
right,
which
i
just
respectfully
can't
explain
why
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
all
right.
but
our
point
is
since
we
have
this
all
the
through,
three
times
that
there
were
no
cars,
no
cargo,
there
is
no
longshoring.
there's
no
one
to
hire
and
what
is
before
this
court
is
basically
the
case
as
it
was
before
incres,
and
i
would
like
to
go
down
some
more
of
the
factual
part
to
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
your
honor,
there
is
no
machinery
in
the
dock.
there's
no
man
to
handle
it.
there
are
no
hoists
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
respectfully,
i
don't
know
where
that
is,
i
know
of
no
such
machinery.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
there
are
no
hoist,
there
are
no
cranes,
there
is
no
cargo
hatches.
these
are
three
and
four
day
cruises
to
nassau
and
sometimes
await
cruise
to
the
various
ports
there.
but
what
i
want
to
show
again
about
the
time
sequence
was
the
injunction
may
of
'66,
the
summary
judgment
asking
for
a
permanent
injunction
in
'67,
11
months
later.
when
he
grants
this,
when
judge
lee
grants
this
may
1,
1967,
then
the
union
has
10
days
to
ask
for
rehearing.
they
did
this,
that's
may
9,
1967.
it
went
all
the
way
until
september
1967,
16
months
later
before
the
rehearing
was
denied.
again,
no
affidavit
by
the
union,
no
fact;
no
fact
of
cars,
cargo,
outside
labor.
what
we
are
saying
is
the
only
words
in
here
that
this
case
could
be
reversed
on
respectfully
are
cleveland
turners
words
on
page
45,
some
of
it
by
outside
labor.
he
didn't
say
american
residence,
he
didn't
say
union,
he
didn't
say
non-union,
he
said
outside
labor.
all
the
way
to
here
in
for
years,
there's
been
no
contention
on
this
because
those
are
the
facts,
and
that's
why
i
went
so
far
opening
statement
to
say
if
you
had
any
idea
these
were
the
facts,
remand
this
case
for
testimony.
i'll
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
if
we've
carried
a
car
in
four
years
dissolve
injunction
as
the
cars,
if
we've
carried
cargo,
it
doesn't
happen.
we
are
talking
about
15
room
stewards
on
the
ariadne.
these
people
stay
with
the
passengers
throughout
the
trip.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
they
are
all
foreign
crew
members.
as
far
as
these
room
stewards
go
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
none
of
the
room
stewards
and
i
cannot
relate
every
crew
member.
some
of
the
other
crewmembers
might.
it's
nowhere
in
the
record.
it's
only
that
they're
totally
foreign
crews.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
i
don't
think
so,
but
i
hesitate
on
that
because
that
has
never
been
raised
because
they
were
under
the
liberian
articles
and
they
were
signed
as
foreign
crewmen
and
they
worked
as
foreign
crewmen.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
all
i
can
say
is
they
adopted
the
union
position
and
they
adopted
the
words
american
residents.
you'll
never
see
the
words
american
residents
in
this
transcript.
i
mean
in
the
record
anyway.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
well,
we
could
never
explain
that.
all
i
can
say
as
they
said
those
words.
it's
not
in
the
record.
their
decision
as
has
been
all
the
way
through
five
court's
now.
i
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
if
they
were
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
if
they
were,
they
were
guessing.
all
i
checked
so
i
could
represent
this
to
you
because
it's
not
in
the
record
was
these
15
room
stewards.
they're
foreign.
i
didn't
check
every
one
of
the
--
i
think
it
is
180
crew
members
to
see
if
they're
foreign.
they
all
were
hired
foreign
as
foreign
crew
members;
they
are
all
under
foreign
articles.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
apparently,
the
union
has
said
that
your
honor.
we
find
that
nowhere
in
the
record,
we
don't
think
it's
factual.
it's
just
as
the
union
has
said
throughout
that
there
were
american
longshoremen,
but
those
words
are
never
in
the
record.
they're
relying
on
the
two
words
outside
labor
by
cleveland
turner
who
we
say
is
mistaken.
we're
saying
that
the
judge
on
a
verified
complaint
saying
this
was
a
passenger
ship
and
on
the
testimony
of
deposition
of
tim
kaine
that
all
the
crew
was
doing
was
baggage
and
ship
stores
that
this
is
enough
to
sustain
in
our
position.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
well,
that
was
interesting
mr.
justice
stewart
when
you
ask
that
because
there
has
never
been
any
handling
of
lines
in
the
case.
i
have
no
ideas.
i
agree
with
you.
somebody
have
to
do
it
from
there.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
but
my
note
on
when
you
asked
that
question
before
and
the
opposing
counsel
replied
is
that
there
is
no
handling
of
lines.
i
don't
know.
i
am
sure
lines
are
throwing
off.
if
they're
throwing
off
the
longshoremen,
i
don't
know.
it's
certainly
never
been
in
our
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact
right
before
that
as
long
as
i'm
addressing
this
to
your
honor,
you
hit
the
what
we
thought
was
the
point
of
our
case
exactly
was
that
here
as
an
interest.
you
have
a
foreign
crew
doing
acts
and
there
is
never
been
any
doubt
of
that,
and
the
only
acts
of
their
doing
that
could
be
in
contention
are
the
50-feet
that
they
move
the
baggage
from
the
customs
area
to
the
gangway,
everything
else
was
aboard
ship.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
i
agree.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
they
have
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
--
to
leap
off
the
ship.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that's
never
come
up
in
this
case,
but
i
agree
there
must
be
someone
in
the
dock.
i
don't
sell
it
could
be
ship's
crew.
well,
they
theoretically
sure
they
could
because
we
have
a
long
pile
of
both,
they
could
go
in
that
way,
but
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
all
right.
i
just
--
i
don't
think
its'
possible.
i
think
what
have
to
be
somewhere
or
other
than
the
ship's
crew.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
no
that
was
point
respectfully
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
we
can't
speculate
on
that.
but,
this
isn't
a
hostile
port.
this
is
work
that
has
always
been
done
by
these
people.
i
heard
the
comments
of
counsel
about
what
happened
in
europe
and
other
places.
it
doesn't
happen
here,
and
that's
why
i
want
to
tell
this
court
what
these
room
stewards
do.
when
someone
comes
to
the
ship,
they
buy
a
ticket
and
they
are
on
a
dock
there,
and
they
have
hand
baggage.
they
don't
have
steamer
trunks,
they
are
not
going
to
europe,
and
this
room
steward
comes
down
asking
what
room
their
in
and
he
carries
their
bags
to
50-feet,
that's
in
this
record
that
tim
kaine
testified
to,
the
50-feet
from
a
customs
area
to
the
gangway,
up
the
gangway
into
their
room.
the
same
room
steward
is
with
these
people
throughout
the
trip.
he
moves
the
bags
when
they
get
ready
to
get
off,
whether
it's
in
nassau
or
foreign
port,
to
the
rail
and
down
on
the
gangway,
and
then
maybe
50-feet
in
the
customs
area.
nobody
else
goes
into
the
customs
area.
there
just
isn't
any
longshoring
in
this
case.
well,
i've
heard
longshoring
out
my
ears
and
there
isn't
any
longshoring.
there
aren't
any
cargo
carriers.
there
isn't
any
longshore
of
men
employed,
and
i
don't
mean
to
make
that
point
so
strongly
and
i
would
like
to
go
down
some
of
the
points
that
were
raised
in
opposing
counsel's
argument.
when
mr.
chief
justice
burger
asked,
he
received
this
comment
from
counsel
that
foreign-flag
ships
can
bring
their
own
longshoreman
and
avoid
the
board.
well,
if
he
will
agree
to
that,
heavens,
we
haven't
even
done
that.
we've
just
brought
our
crew.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
oh,
i
misunderstood
of
him
because
that's
even
further
than
we
would
go.
we
just
have
a
crew.
it
does
one
thing.
it
takes
orders
from
its
foreign
officers
who
tell
it
its
responsibilities.
and
unlike
american
crews,
it
works
probably
a
longer
day.
wages,
i
don't
know
if
these
people
get
more
or
less,
the
record
is
bear
of
this.
the
unions
never
told
you
about
wages.
they've
never
said
that
our
people
get
more
or
less.
there
are
no
facts
like
this
before
your
honors.
it's
a
guess,
a
conjecture.
i
conjecture
we
get
more.
i
don't
know.
if
these
were
the
facts
again
in
the
16
months
from
a
temporary
injunction
which
naturally
is
granted
a
little
bit
in
haste,
in
those
16
months
couldn't
some
of
these
facts
been
brought
up?
we
suggest
that
the
only
reason
why
this
case
is
here
is
that
of
a
union
says
we
have
the
titled
union
and
we
want
to
organize
people
and
therefore,
we'll
try
it
on
these
ships
in
spite
of
benz,
in
spite
of
mcculloch,
sociedad,
and
in
spite
of
incres,
and
there's
no
use
to
argue
your
honor
what
those
cases
held.
i
can
see
from
your
questions
that
they
are
even
six
years
old,
their
vivid
in
your
mind.
and
under
incres,
you
can't
do
what
they're
doing.
so
they
try
and
get
away
from
incres
and
say
this
isn't
a
ship's
crew.
this
is
longshoremen.
and
your
questions
point
that
out.
it's
not
longshoremen.
it's
the
ship's
crew
that
is
almost
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
no.
if
i
am
wrong
on
the
facts,
if
they
are
american
residents
doing
longshoring
work,
if
it's
not
the
crew,
then
i've
got
a
good
chance
to
lose.
the
only
way
i
could
win
then
is
for
you
people
to
say
as
you
said
in
incres
that
well
it
is
still
basically
a
foreign
crew.
but
that
is
why
i
go
so
far.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
exactly.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
mr.
justice
black,
what
i
would
say
to
that
is
number
one
you
take
the
verified
complaint
which
says
passenger
ships
and
this
three
or
four-day
trips
and
nothing
about
cargo
or
anything
like
that.
then
you
go
to
the
deposition
of
tim
kaine
which
is
not
nearly
as
clear
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that's
the
part
that
we
had
so
much
trouble
with
the
record
that
the
pages
20
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that's
the
pages
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that's
right,
53
and
54
of
the
record.
and
the
reason
why
i
quoted
the
other
two
types
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
yes
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
not
as
clearly
as
if
when
you
also
read
53
and
54.
you
looked
at
the
other
two
depositions
of
tim
kaine
under
oath
by
mr.
gutman
where
he
sets
his
questions
out
little
better.
you
see,
that's
why
we
pointed
out
to
this
court
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
all
right.
that
shows
that
there
was
no
cargo,
but
there
were
no
automobiles,
that
the
ship
hadn't
carried
these.
and
therefore,
there
could
be
no
longshoring
work.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
yes
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
that's
right.
we
would
ask
that
if
you
did
not
affirm
this
case
that
you
remand
it
for
that
testimony
because
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
because
the
clearest
testimony
is
the
eastern
versus
ariadne
--
is
the
case
where
eastern
steamship
lines
was
against
this
union.
you
see
these
people
took
their
signs
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
yes
your
honor,
but
it
has
been
considered
by
each
of
the
courts
so
long
as
a
companion
case
and
judge
lee
when
he
decide
this
case
was
aware
of
the
eastern
case
and
stated
that
he
was
aware
of
it.
and
of
course,
it's
in
the
same
circuit
court
in
dade
county
in
the
same
court
house,
its
public
record
and
we
would
say
judicial
notice.
because
i
can't
express
this
strongly
enough,
the
signs
started
out
saying
eastern
safety
conditions.
they
pasted
over
the
sign
and
put
the
word
ariadne
and
put
the
word
bahama
star.
they
didn't
even
change
their
signs.
they
were
not
aware
of
incres,
they
were
not
aware
of
the
foreign-flag
cases.
they
said
that
they
just
have
the
wrong
defendant
when
they
had
eastern;
that's
the
ships
agent.
you
would
think
eastern
own
the
ships
probably
if
you
just
looked
at
sales
brochure
that
says
our
general
agents.
that's
why
i'm
trying
to
show
you
the
sequence
of
this
over
these
four
years
because
the
facts
are
so
clear
and
the
record
only
has
these
little
bitty
parts,
the
outside
labor
contention
that
the
union
relies
on
and
our
two
pages
of
deposition
and
our
verified
complaint.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
the
other
two
depositions
which
i
have
in
my
brief
taken
by
the
same
attorney,
mr.
gutman
for
a
union
for
the
same
man
mr.
tim
kaine,
and
that's
the
part
i
read.
no
cargo,
not
at
all.
no
cars,
not
at
all.
without
cars
and
cargo,
you
have
no
longshoring
--
mr.
justice
white
asked
in
spite
of
incres,
if
the
crew
did
this,
could
that
get
around
incres?
that's
our
point
exactly.
the
crew
is
doing
this.
you
said
in
incres,
foreign-flag
ships,
foreign
crews
that
is
a
little
area
that
has
been
carved
away.
that's
taken
out
of
the
preemption.
that's
exactly
our
position.
i
can't
even
say
it
as
well.
and
also
footnote
6
of
the
government's
brief,
we
didn't
have
the
government's
brief
when
we
wrote
our
brief,
and
consequently,
i
wrote
to
the
government
and
said
heavens,
how
can
you
write
this
kind
of
a
brief?
and
i
was
fortunate
in
getting
back
two
letters
from
the
solicitor
general
mr.
griswold
saying
if
under
footnote
6,
it
was
the
crew,
then
there
might
be
a
different
result
and
he
put
it
very,
very
clearly.
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
the
two
letters
--
mr.
richard
m.
leslie
no
your
honor.
those
were
letters,
the
first
one
is
dates
december
30,
1969,
the
second
one
was
send
up
to
me
when
i
got
here
was
dated
january
1,
1969.
the
last
sentence
says
we
have
made
it
clear
in
footnote
6
of
our
brief
that
if
the
facts
are
as
you
have
stated
the
result
might
have
been
different.
that's
the
point
that
your
honors
brought
up
on
footnote
6.
we
say
that
is
the
case
and
we
say
it
has
been
through
five
courts,
a
judge
for
a
temporary
injunction,
an
appeal
that
for
that
same
judge
12
to
16
months
later,
another
appeal.
if
the
facts
were
different
and
i
was
on
the
losing
side,
certainly,
i
would
have
brought
in
those
facts.
but
they're
not,
and
that's
why
i
said
to
begin
with,
i
didn't
want
this
court
to
possibly
be
misled
because
it
isn't
as
clearer
record
as
it
could
be.
it
never
is
in
a
temporary
injunction.
