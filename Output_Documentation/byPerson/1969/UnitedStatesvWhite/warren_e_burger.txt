chief

but
suppose
we
assume
that
he
was
paid?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
boeger.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
could
make
that
same
argument
about
any
treasury
agent
or
narcotics
agent
or
fbi
agent
and
argue
that
he’d
been
threatened
of
being
dismissed
if
not
didn’t
go
in
and
carrying
out
this
order.
if
you
can
prevail
on
the
argument
you’re
making
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
this
court
or
any
court
ever
said
that
it
has
to
be
this
kind
of
verified
consent
that
you’re
talking
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
you’re
talking
about
now?
has
this
court
every
said
in
many
case
intimated
that
the
consent
must
pass
these
--
jump
these
hurdles
that
you’re
talking
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let’s
assume
that
they
are
coerced
informants?
what
impact
does
that
have
on
it
if
there
is
a
faithful
recording
made
of
what
transpired?
let’s
take
your
position
for
a
moment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
in
any
way
affect
the
reliability
of
the
evidence
that
you
can
suggest?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
i
follow
you,
you
want
the
benefit
of
katz
which
came
after
your
case
but
not
the
benefit
of
desist?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
the
man
had
no
bug
at
all
but
merely
came
and
testified
against
the
defendant
in
this
case,
you
wouldn’t
have
had
any
argument
to
make
to
us,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
that
argument
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
government
shouldn’t
hire
undercover
agents
to
get
narcotic
peddlers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’m
talking
now
about
a
man
who
goes
in
without
the
device.
are
you
suggesting
that
before
they
send
an
undercover
agent
in,
in
these
circumstances,
they
must
get
a
warrant
to
send
that
agent
in
if
he
carries
no
device?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
the
attorney
general’s
argument
that
this
bugging
device
as
you
call
it
produces
a
much
more
accurate
version
of
the
conversation
so
that
the
undercover
agent
can’t
distort
or
invent
some
testimony?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
a
recording
now,
you
have
a
perfectly
reliable
reproduction
of
the
conversation,
don’t
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
certainly,
i
think
they
can
investigate.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
boeger.
mr.

do
you
have
anything
further?
chief

e.

thank
you.
the

thank
you
for
submission

chief

the

is
no.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready
mr.
wilson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
was
a
pocket
radio
of
some
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
a
transmitter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
that
conversation
is
carried
outside
the
building
and
recorded
in
the
–
somewhere
else?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
presumably,
they
were
sitting
in
the
car
with
--
where
they
were
listening
to
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
attorney
general.
mr.
boeger.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
is
the
--
would
you
spell
out
for
me
precisely
where
do
you
think
the
search
is
and
where
is
the
seizure
on
facts
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
say
the
man
in
the
closet
first,
that
the
man
who
is
sitting
in
the
closet
listening
with
his
ears,
not
aided
by
any
electronic
devices?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
he
had
been
just
a
casual
visitor
drinking
beer
with
the
two
of
them
and
down
until
the
united
states
attorney
or
the
treasury
agents,
all
about
this,
do
you
think
he
also
would
have
been
guilty
of
seizing,
if
you
put
it
seizing
these
words?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
move
on
to
each
of
them
one
at
a
time
and
help
me
if
you
make
a
distinction.
how
about
then
the
occasion
when
they
were
in
jackson's
home?
jackson
had
the
electronic
transmitter
somewhere
on
his
person
and
it
transmitted
out.
would
you
tell
us
what
is
the
search
and
what
is
the
seizure
and
then
third,
what's
unreasonable
about
it?
those
would
be
three
issues,
wouldn't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
taking
the
position
--
go
ahead.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
i
understand
you
are
saying
that
all
eavesdropping
violates
the
fourth
amendment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
you
finished
your
presentation-in-chief,
mr.
boeger?
you
are
saving
your
rest
of
your
time
for
rebuttal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
how
much
time,
let
me
take
a
look
at
the
note
here;
you
have
got
six
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
attorney
general,
you
have
seven
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
sometimes,
it
might
have
a
matter
of
more
than
a
passing
interest
to
the
government
agency
to
know
whether
one
of
its
men
was
endangered
too?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
we
govern
it
to
a
balancing
until
we
find
that
there
is
one
right
under
the
constitution
apparently
on
a
collision
course
with
another
right?
that
is
to
spell
out
some
right
of
the
public
in
conflict
with
claimed
right
of
the
individual,
that's
the
only
time
we
have
to
get
to
balancing,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
suppose
if
anyone
were
to
suggest
that
a
listener
can't
repeat
the
conversation
he
has
heard,
perhaps
even
the
first
amendment
argument
might
be
raised
about
that
in
addition
on
first
amendment
right
to
be.
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
