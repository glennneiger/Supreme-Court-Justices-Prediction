mr.
john
l.
boeger
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
united
states
versus
james
a.
white
is
not
a
case
of
consensual
eavesdropping.
the
record
below
and
the
government’s
own
statement
of
facts
and
its
free
from
the
merits
do
not
support
the
contention
that
there
was
consent
by
the
informant
in
this
case.
this
issue
was
raised
by
the
respondent
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
stated
in
their
en
banc
opinion
that
they
did
not
reach
the
issue
of
consent
because
they
did
not
feel
that
it
was
material.
the
government
in
their
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
their
statement
of
facts
stated
that
the
informant
consented.
in
our
brief,
in
our
position
i
call
to
their
attention
the
fact
that
the
record
did
not
support
consent
--
voluntary
consent.
interestingly
enough,
in
their
statement
of
facts
in
their
brief
on
the
merits,
there
is
no
claim
that
the
informant
voluntarily
consented.
on
friday,
i
received
the
reply
brief
where
the
government
argues
that
this
--
it
would
be
fair
for
this
court
to
infer
that
the
informant
acted
freely
and
voluntarily
because
he
work
for
the
government
for
about
eight
days.
of
course,
the
first
day
work
was
when
the
first
situation
of
the
electronic
eavesdropping
took
place.
the
government
quotes
from
a
district
of
columbia,
district
court
case
united
states
versus
sorkin.
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that
case.
however,
the
only
thing
that
case
held
was
that
if
the
informant
hoped
that
there
were
be
leniency
if
he
cooperated,
this
did
not
necessarily
mean
that
he
involuntarily
consent
it.
but
the
court
stated
that
if
the
government
promise
leniency
or
if
they
went
out
and
found
a
weak
person
or
a
vulnerable
person
and
turned
them
into
informants,
they
would
restraint
this
use
because
this
--
the
record
would
not
support
a
finding
or
voluntary
consent.
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
consent
in
type
of
cases
should
be
decided
just
like
consent
in
any
ordinary
search
and
seizure
case.
now,
the
government’
failure
or
tires
to
excuse
this
failure
to
sustain
its
burden
of
proving
consent
by
saying
that
the
defense
never
raise
the
consent
issue
at
trial.
well,
i
submit
that
it
was
raised
a
trial
and
that
the
court
ruled
because
there
was
an
objection
to
the
evidence.
there
was
a
motion
the
strike
all
the
evidence
obtained
by
the
eavesdropping.
the
government
cited
a
number
of
cases
to
the
trial
judge
on
lee,
lopez
case,
and
a
number
of
seventh
circuit
cases.
every
case
cited
was
a
situation
where
there
was
consent.
the
trial
court
then
just
stated
that
we’ve
been
through
this
before
and
overall
the
motion
to
strike.
we
submit
that
it’s
the
government’s
burden
whenever
they
rely
upon
consent
to
sustain
the
lawfulness
of
a
search
and
seizure
but
the
burden
is
upon
them
to
prove
consent.
this
court
in
bumper
versus
north
carolina
held
and
i
just
give
a
short
quote,
“when
a
prosecutor
seeks
to
rely
upon
consent
to
justify
the
lawfulness
of
a
search
he
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
consent
was
in
fact
freely
and
voluntarily
given.
the
court
further
--
this
court
further
said
that
acquiescence
is
not
sufficient
consent.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
of
course
bumper
involved
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
bumper
course
involved
the
lady
that
let
the
policeman.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
of
course
she
was
the
defendant.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
but
if
i
think
what’s
very
important
is
that
if
this
case
would
be
reversed,
it
would
allow
the
government
to
coerce
people
to
become
informant,
it
would
all
them
and
give
them
authority
to
get
the
people
to
put
this
type
above
and
go
in
and
talk
to
anybody
trying
--
well,
just
violate
their
privacy
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
of
course,
since
the
informant
didn’t’
testify
in
this
case,
we
don’t
know
want
happened
and
i
think
this
is
very
important.
in
other
words,
if
the
informant
had
testified
and
there
had
been
cross-examination
maybe
the
record
would
have
showed
that
he
was
a
voluntary
agent
that
they
didn’t
go
out
and
say,
now
if
you
don’t
do
this
you’re
going
to
be
charged
with
some
particular
crime.
but
the
way
the
record
is
right
now,
the
way
the
record
stands,
we
don’t
know?
mr.
john
l.
boeger
the
consent
that
this
court
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
in
an
electronic
eavesdropping
case?
no.
lopez
was
of
course
an
agent.
on
lee
case
was
paid
informer.
maybe
some
of
the
other
cases,
the
point
just
wouldn’t
raised.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
i
agree
that
the
record
does
sustain
that
and
he
did
it
and
that
he
knew
the
battles
on
it.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
i
believe
that’s
right
and
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
i
think
the
answer
is
when
there’s
a
search
and
seizure
and
the
government
attempts
to
sustain
it
because
of
consent
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
it’s
up
to
them
to
prove
it.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
no
that
the
informant
consented.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
think
if
this
isn’t
required
of
this
court
in
its
opinions
that
it
would
give
the
government
authority
to
coerce
people
to
become
informants
and
bug,
who
knows.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
think
that
whole
scale
eavesdropping
by
the
government
could
probably
be
one
of
the
most
serious
problems
of
this
country
because
it
could
suppress
first
amendment
rights
of
all
citizens
not
just
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
individual
defendants.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
no,
i
think
that
might
be
a
little
different
situation.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
you
mean
if
the
informant
is
quite
guilty
but
haven’t
been
sentenced
yet?
mr.
john
l.
boeger
yes,
and
i
was
under
the
impression
that
the
laws
the
way
it
stood
now
that
if
a
person
enter
a
plea
of
guilty
for
the
reason
that
he
was
promised
a
certain
sentence
that
this
would
be
involuntary.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
think
it
might
fall
down
to
that.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
in
this
case,
your
honor,
i
think
of
course
the
government’s
reply
brief
on
what
an
informant,
why
he
might
be
motivated
to
carry
device,
i
think
are
there
may
be
cases
in
which
the
informant
was
pressured
to
such
an
extent
as
deprive
him
of
his
freewill.
the
failure
of
informant
to
be
on
that
witness
stand
and
the
failure
of
the
respondent,
defense
counsel
to
cross-examine
that
person
is
why
we
have
this
consent
problem
before
the
court
right
now.
so
i
think
that’s
a
reliability
problem.
and
i
think
the
court
should
not
do
away
with
the
right
if
cross-examination.
i
like
to
bring
out
one
--
what
i
think
is
probably
the
most
important
think
of
the
entire
case.
the
government
states,
it
gives
a
number
of
reason
why
electronic
eavesdropping
is
important
to
them.
it’s
protection
for
secret
agents
number
of
things.
well,
of
course
they
could
have
protection
for
their
agents
and
still
not
introduce
the
evidence
at
the
trial.
and
of
course
if
they
don’t
and
haven’t
used
the
evidence
in
any
way
then
it
didn’t
taint
the
conviction
and
so
there’s
no
problem.
but
nowhere
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
that’s
possible
if
they
don’t
have
the
evidence.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
they
did
use
its
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
and
of
course
it
tainted
the
conviction.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
don’t
think
there
is
any
doubt
that
when
they
--
if
the
evidence
was
unlawfully
obtained,
then
of
course,
i
think
that
does
taint
a
conviction
of
its
use
at
all
i
think
under
the
silverthorne
lumber
case.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
oh!
absolutely
not,
i
think
anytime
the
government
uses
an
electronic
device
that
they
must
get
a
warrant.
the
government
wants
all
people
in
the
united
states
to
trust
their
discretion,
agents
all
over
the
county,
their
discretion
on
who
to
bug,
when
to
bug,
why
to
bug
them,
they
even
say
in
their
brief
that
they
won’t
be
able
to
do
it
without
probable
cause
so
they
do
it
on
rumor.
they
give
no
reason
on
their
brief
why
they
have
to
do
this
without
getting
judicial
authority.
there
has
to
be
and
there
should
be
some
judicial
control
over
host
sale
eavesdropping.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
your
honor?
mr.
john
l.
boeger
there’s
no
doubt
i
think
that
katz
takes
care
of
my
problem.
i
think
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
yes.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
think
katz
overrules
on
lee
but
it’s
factually
a
little
different
situation
on
the
facts
its’
not
on
all
force.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
katz
is
on
all-force
factually
with
on
lee.
this
case
is
on
all
force
with
on
lee
because
on
on
lee
there
was
--
we’ve
gone
into
previously
on
lee,
there
was
consent.
there
was
a
paid
informant.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
desist
is
an
attempt
by
the
government
to
have
this
court
apply
a
1969
case
to
apply
it
retroactively
so
that
katz
which
is
a
1967
case
can’t
be
applied
here?
mr.
john
l.
boeger
desist
was
1969.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
bugging
was
in
late
‘65
and
early
’66.
now,
katz
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
it
doesn’t
say
everything.
it
says
that
to
the
extent
katz
departed
from
previous
holdings
of
this
court.
it
should
be
given
wholly
prospective
application.
i
submit
that
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
that
the
seventh
circuit’s
judgment
is
not
in
conflict
with
any
prior
decision
of
this
court,
and
this
is
exactly
what
the
seventh
circuit
en
banc
opinion
states.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
but
desist
came
after
the
judgment
in
this
case.
actually
desist
which
relies
upon
the
stovall
case,
stovall
came
after
the
bugging
and
after
the
trial
of
this
case.
whereas
the
linkletter
case
which
the
court
had
followed
linkletter
or
would
follow
linkletter
here,
katz
case
would
apply
because
the
white
case
was
on
direct
appeal
at
the
time
of
this
court’s
decision
in
katz.
the
government
has
stated
that
the
informant
was
unavailable
at
trial.
well,
in
checking
the
record,
you’ll
see
at
page
39
of
the
printed
appendix
that
the
trial
was
in
november
1966.
the
agents
testified
that
they
looked
at
the
informant’s
home
in
july
and
august
couldn’t
find
him.
they
checked
the
missing
persons
list
and
the
like
company
and
then
the
question
was
asked,
“did
you
go
any
other
places?”
and
at
page
40
of
the
appendix,
the
agent
said,
“no,
this
is
all
the
checking
we
did.”
so
they
didn’t
even
check
in
september
and
october
and
parts
of
november
to
see
if
they
could
find
the
informant.
respondent
submits
that
there
are
additional
reasons
for
affirming
the
seventh
circuit’s
judgment
and
that
in
the
exercise
of
this
court’s
supervisory
powers.
this
conduct
of
the
agents,
we
submit
was
in
violation
or
illinois
states
statutes.
there
had
been
an
earlier
case
in
the
illinois
state
by
the
illinois
state
supreme
court,
people
versus
dixon
that
had
approved
the
telephone
extension,
an
agent
listening
on
the
telephone
extension.
however,
i
don’t
think
that
that
case
necessarily
mens
that
the
type
of
bugging
involved
in
white
would
have
been
legal.
and
then
in
people
versus
kurth,
another
illinois
supreme
court
case
which
was
decided
before
trial
of
this
case.
the
illinois
supreme
court
said
that,
“our
statute
it’s
immaterial
whether
or
not
there’s
consent
or
not.
it’s
illegal.”
so
this
isn’t
a
lopez
situation
because
here
the
agents
the
conduct
was
unlawful.
the
agents
knew
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
had
held
that
bugging
without
a
warrant
or
just
bugging
without
consent
was
illegal.
and
they
went
ahead
and
did
it
anyway.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
on
lee,
the
agent
or
the
secret
informant
was
a
paid
informant.
the
court’s
opinion
does
not
say
specifically
whether
or
that
we
make
a
finding
of
consent.
but
i
think
in
reading
the
opinion
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
the
informant
that
there
was
consent
by
the
informant.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
submit
that
that
would
be
the
same
as
the
silverman
case.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
that’s
exactly.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
that
would
be
an
actual
intrusion
in
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
yes,
in
other
words
there
would
be
an
actual
intrusion
into
the
constitutionally
protected
area.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
sir?
mr.
john
l.
boeger
the
defendant.
in
other
words
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
a
bug
being
in
the
constitutionally
protected
area
without
a
warrant,
without
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
i
think
under
silverman,
if
there
is
an
invasion
into
the
constitutionally
protected
area,
it’s
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
or
at
the
very
least,
if
it’s
an
actual
intrusion,
it’s
certainly
under
the
supervisory
powers
of
this
court
that
the
silverman
they
say
would
not
permissible
to
use
that
evidence.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
of
a
bug.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
knowingly,
i
believe
that
he
knew
it.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
right.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
would.
that,
i
think
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
think
would
be
the
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
think
the
government
can
hire
undercover
agents
all
i
ask
is
that
just
as
this
court
stated
in
osborn,
discussed
in
the
burger
case,
is
that
they
go
to
a
judge
and
let
him
decide
whether
or
not
it
would
be
proper
to
use
an
electronic
eavesdropping
device.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
don’t
think
the
court
needs
to
go
that
far
in
this
case.
but
i
--
that’s
my
own
feeling.
in
other
words,
that’s
also
similar
to
the
lewis
case
but
lewis,
the
government
admitted
that
we
did
not
put
an
informant
into
the
house
to
see
or
hear
anything.
we
didn’t
--
we
weren’t
eavesdropping
at
all.
we
just
went
in
there
to
pick
up
a
package
and
leave.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
it’s
--
i
think
it’s
the
same
thing
as
somebody
committed
murder
and
the
murder
weapon
is
in
the
defendant’s
home.
they
still
must
and
should
get
a
warrant
before
they
break
down
the
door
and
go
on
get
that
murder
weapon.
now,
it
may
be
better
that
if
they
had
that
murder
weapon
and
run
a
ballistic
test
on
it
but
then
the
defendant’s
fingerprints
were
on
the
gun
and
no
one
else’s
that
that
might
be
better
evidence.
but
this
court
has
held
on
numerous
occasions
that
they
still
must
get
judicial
authority
before
they
break
down
somebody’s
door.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
think
when
it,
you
get
to
a
point
where
they
have
a
prospective
defendant.
certainly,
in
this
case,
there
were
eight
days
so
maybe
along
with
that
--
somewhere
along
the
line
they
thought
they
have
their
man.
so
i
think
when
they
use
an
informant
in
this
situation
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
i
suppose
they
have
some
sort
of
investigation
prior
to
that
but
i
don’t
know.
the
defense
counsel
tried
to
cross-examine
the
agents
regarding
their
relationship
with
the
informant
prior
to
the
date
of
the
first
transaction
and
the
defense
counsel
wouldn’t
allow
it
to
go
into
that.
i
think
one
of
the
comments
by
the
trial
judge
was
that
the
informant
is
not
on
trial
here.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
here
is
not
just
the
legality
of
a
search
and
seizure.
the
issue,
of
course,
is
combination
of
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
and
then
the
use
of
that
evidence
in
a
federal
criminal
trial.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
this
would
be
--
while
the
–
oh,
let's
take
the
situation
of
the
informant.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
of
course,
i
think
he
seizes
words
in
effect.
now,
whether
that
is
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure,
that's
a
different
question
than
what's
involved
in
the
electronic
eavesdropping
cases,
but
i
mean,
he
actually
has
the
words.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
yes,
again
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
it's
unreasonable,
but
i
think
when
someone
looks
with
their
eyes
at
something
in
plain
view,
that's
a
seizure
and
then
goes
over
and
picks
up
the
material,
that's
a
seizure.
of
course,
it's
a
question
of
whether
seizing
something
in
plain
view
is
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
no,
not
in
this
case.
and
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
no,
we
haven't
argued
that
point.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
that's
the
only
–
as
i
understand
it,
this
is
the
only
ruling
by
the
court
of
appeals
and,
of
course,
the
only
thing
raised
by
the
government
in
the
petition
for
cert,
and
of
course
it's
the
only
thing
that
we
have
raised.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
do
not
think
there
is
a
meaningful
distinction
between
whether
the
overhearing
occurred
in
the
informant's
home
or
whether
it
occurred
in
the
defendant's
home.
i
think
the
social
interest
and
the
policy
regions
behind
the
fourth
amendment
still
requires
and
should
require
that
there'd
be
judicial
control
whenever
an
individual
has
an
electronic
device,
listening
device
on
his
person
and
then
engages
someone
else
in
conversation.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
of
course
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
it
has
--
that
is
the
important
thing.
of
course,
our
cases
aren't
just
cut
and
dried
as
others
and
therefore
--
for
example,
its
my
contention
which
actually
doesn't
have
to
be
made
in
this
case
that
actually
the
government
obtaining
warrants
before
they
electronically
eavesdrop,
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
this
electronic
surveillance
should
be
permitted,
but
this
court
has
indicated
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
electronic
eavesdropping.
of
course,
this
court
has
indicated
and
osborn,
the
berger
case
and
the
katz
case,
that
if
we
are
going
to
allow
the
search
and
seizure
that
shouldn't
be
done
without
a
warrant,
i
think
there
are
good
reasons
for
not
permitting
the
electronic
surveillance
at
all
even
with
the
warrant.
but
apparent
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
think
there
is
good
constitutional
reasons
based
upon
the
holding
of
this
court
many
years
ago
in
the
boyd
case.
in
boyd,
this
court
held
that
the
government
could
not
subpoena
private
papers
of
the
individual.
the
court
treated
the
case
as
a
criminal
case,
i
believe
it
was
a
custom's
violation
forfeiture
case.
the
court
held
that
the
government
couldn't
even
subpoena
through
judicial
processes,
private
papers.
now
the
only
distinction
between
that
and
the
electronic
eavesdropping
is
that
in
one
case
the
individual
put
his
thoughts
down
on
the
paper
whereas
here
in
the
white
case,
the
individual
spoke
his
thoughts.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
of
course,
that’s
what
this
court
held
in
the
hoffa
case.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
in
my
opinion,
it
isn’t
but
i
think
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
no,
because
a
person
maybe
and
this
court
has
held
in
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
and
i
will
accept
that
he
takes
a
risk
that
this
person
might
repeat
what
he
said.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
think
it
is,
but
apparently
this
court
ruled
otherwise
in
hoffa.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
and
lewis.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
think
it
is,
but
i
think
the
court
has
held
otherwise
in
hoffa
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
no,
i
don’t
think
so
because
i
think
the
electronic
surveillance
is
then
an
addition
to
the
what
intrusions
are
already
been
made.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
for
purposes
of
this
case
i'll
concede
that.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
right
and
of
course,
anytime
there
is
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
you
still
have
to
prove
--
show
taint.
government
in
it’s
right
ironically
takes
a
possession
that
electronic
surveillance
is
very
necessary
in
the
fight
against
crime
and
in
federal
and
state
law
enforcement,
but
the
ironic
part
about
it
when
you
start
examining
cases
where,
the
government
has
had
to
admit
that
the
electronic
surveillance
was
illegal.
then
when
this
court
has
ordered
hearings
in
lower
courts
to
the
determine
taint,
it
always
ends
up
for
almost,
while
a
large
percentage
of
the
time,
they
have
never
use
the
electronic
surveillance
and
this
is
even
in
situations
where
defendants
have
been
overheard,
discussing
the
case,
discussing
facts
concerning
the
allegations
and
the
indictment.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
yes,
your
honor.
as
i
understand
this
court’s
rulings
and
desist,
it
was
that
katz
is
prospective
as
to
--
i
don’t
know
--
things
that
katz
departed
from
in
previous
holdings.
i
don’t
think
the
seventh
circuit's
holdings,
of
course,
the
seventh
circuit
found
in
its
en
banc
opinion
that
this
was
a
fourth
amendment
violation
regardless
of
whether
they
considered
katz.
now,
it’s
pretty
difficult,
but
maybe
this
case
needs
to
be
--
we
turn
back
the
hands
of
time
and
have
the
court
consider
this
case
as
the
law
was
before
katz.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
yes.
and
of
course,
the
government
relies
on
hoffa
and
lewis
and
they
don’t
want
us
to
use
katz,
but
hoffa
and
lewis
were
decided
before
eavesdropping
in
this
case.
also
at
the
time,
of
course,
that
the
seventh
circuit
rendered
it’s
opinion,
desist
had
been
handed
down
by
this
court.
therefore,
i
think
more
properly
linkletter
should
apply
in
this
situation.
and
linkletter
would
apply
katz
because
the
white
case
was
on
direct
appeal
at
the
time
katz
was
decided.
this
isn't
a
2255
situation
coming
up
years
later.
this
is
something
that
was
objected
to
a
trial
and
taken
on
up
thorough
the
appellate
process.
we
submit
that
this
court
should
not
give
it’s
judicial
blessing
to
uncontrolled
electronic
eavesdropping
by
the
government.
no
where
in
this
brief
does
the
government
suggest
a
reason
why
they
have
to
electronically
eavesdrop
on
conservations
without
some
judicial
controls.
certainly,
in
this
case
it
went
on
for
many
days
and
currently
there
is
no
argument
that
a
judge
wasn’t
available
which
sometimes
happens
on
mid-night
searches
in
narcotics
cases.
but
if
this
court
should
reverse
this
case,
it’s
going
to
permit
the
government
to
electronically
eavesdrop
on
conversations
that
the
speaker
thinks
are
private,
that
they
are
not
going
to
be
electronically
recorded
or
transmitted
to
others.
of
course,
since
the
government
argues
that
they
should
be
able
to
do
this,
not
only
without
a
warrant,
but
without
even
probable
cause,
but
on
rumor
alone
i
think
the
chances
of
abuse
are
enormous.
it
not
only,
in
our
opinion,
would
be
a
violation
of
the
victim’s
fourth
amendment
rights,
but
it
would
be
a
suppression
of
first
amendment
rights
of
all
citizens
in
the
united
states.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
in
other
words
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
that
is
my
opinion,
i
do
think
that
the
court
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
i
think
this
court
has
indicated
in
katz
and
then
osborn,
berger
that
they
will
permit
it
if
there
is
a
judicial
control,
something
like
a
warrant.
now
there
have
been
arguments
made
that
it
might
be
impossible
to
draft
a
statute
in
such
a
way
to
get
away
from
a
general
search
for
evidence.
i
guess,
we'll
have
to
wait
and
see
if
and
when
a
case
ever
comes
up
on
this
new
statute.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
if
the
informant
has
a
recorder
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
if
they,
assuming
that
they
put
it
in
the
evidence
at
the
trial.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
because,
again
i
think
the
fourth
amendment
requires
that
before
this
type
of
evidence
be
permitted,
that
they
obtain
a
warrant.
and
of
course,
in
this
case
you
have
the
additional
problem
of
the
informant
not
even
testifying
trial
and
this
is
significant
for
two
reasons.
first,
of
course,
you
are
unable
to
cross
examine
the
informant,
but
secondly,
evidence
was
introduced
in
this
case
which
was
hearsay.
in
other
words,
the
agents
overheard
conversations
made
by
the
defendant
and
the
informant.
the
agent
testified
to
what
he
heard
the
informant
say.
now
that’s
clearly
hearsay.
certainly,
there
is
no
way
that
you
could
cross
examine
the
informant.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
it’s
not
hearsay.
i
just
think
the
fourth
amendment
requires
a
warrant
in
that
situation.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
electronic
overhearing?
mr.
john
l.
boeger
no,
not
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
electronic
eavesdropping.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
no
and
that's
a
situation
of
course
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
electronic
surveillance
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
unless
there
is
a
warrant.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well
for
one
thing
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
think
if
all
the
cases,
all
the
decisions
of
this
court
run
out
of
katz
or
rather
that
there
is
no
case
directly
in
point
with
this
case,
therefore,
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion
is
not
contrary
to
any
previous
decision
of
this
case.
for
that
reason,
the
appellee,
the
respondent
to
this
case
does
not
need
katz
in
order
to
prevail.
we
have
another,
i
suppose
the
closest
case
is
of
course
the
on
lee
case
which
--
i
do
not
know
if
the
government
is
arguing
that
on
lee
is
still
good
law
or
whether
they
are
not,
but
certainly
on
lee
was
consensual
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
maybe
it
did
and
maybe
it
did
not.
i
do
know
that
katz
says
that
overruled
goldman
and
the
olmstead
case.
mr.
justice
brennan
in
his
dissent
in
lopez
said
that
goldman,
olmstead
and
on
lee
should
be
overruled.
well,
i
think
it
is
certainly
clear
that
katz
overruled
olmstead
and
goldman.
it
did
not
specifically
state
the
opinion
that
they
are
overruling
on
lee.
i
suppose
this
case
presents
that
issue
clearly.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
electronic
eavesdropping,
your
honor?
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
mean,
you
mean
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
my
personal
opinion
is
that
the
use
of
informants
and
certainly
use
of
the
informants
quite
often
entails
coercion
on
that
person,
addicts.
i
think
better
practice
would
be
that
there
be
a
warrant
before
you
take
someone
in
to
go
in
and
elicit
statement
from
someone.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
no,
but
certainly
that's
not
an
informant
type
of
situation
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
no,
i
am
not
taking
the
position,
i
am
not
taking
the
position
that
all
eavesdropping
--
just
all
eavesdropping
requires
a
warrant.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
electronic
eavesdropping.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
of
course,
back
then
when
it
was
written,
they
didn't,
i
guess,
have
such
things
as
electronic
bugs
and
that
might
be
the
reason
why
it's
not
specifically
stated
in
the
fourth
amendment.
of
course,
there
had
been
some
dispute
in
the
past
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
that's
right,
there
has
actually
been
some
dispute.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
this
apparently
is
what
this
court
has
held
certainly
in
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
now,
we
submit
that
whether
or
not
there
was
a
voluntary
government
agent,
in
other
words,
whether
or
not
the
informant
consented
to
the
placement
of
the
bug
on
his
person
is
a
legally
significant
issue.
however,
if
this
case
is
reversed,
it
will
permit
the
government
to
go
out,
coerce
people
to
put
the
bug
on
their
person
and
then
engage
people
in
conversation
and
record
what
they
say.
i
think
this
would
be
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
yes,
and
apparently
although
the
government
says
this
is
necessary
in
their
fight
against
crime,
they
have
been
doing
it
for
years
and
organized
gambling
are
still
going
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
apparently,
it
is
going
on.
i
think
in
the
long-run
that
the
use
of
coerced
informant,
placing
the
bugs
on
them
that
this
is
going
to
be
close
to
what
george
orwell
wrote
about
in
1984
which
is
only
14
years
away.
i
think
it
will
cause
people
to
clam
up,
they
aren't
going
to
cooperate
with
the
police,
probably
people
don't
cooperate
with
the
police
as
much
now
as
they
used
to.
they
are
afraid
of
the
police.
they
are
going
to
be
afraid
that
everyone
they
are
talking
to
is
bugged
and
i
am--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
that's
i
think
we
all
want
to
go
off
the
record
every
once
in
a
while.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
no,
i
represent
the
respondent.
i
just
have
one
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
i
just
really
only
have
one
short
comment,
your
honor.
although
the
government
is
apparently
stating
that
they
are
not
urging
that
they
be
permitted
to
use
this
type
of
electronic
bug
to
obtain
statements
or
confessions
of
past
events,
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
effect
of
a
reversal
here
might
permit
just
that
because
in
the
sixth
circuit,
just
very
recently
in
the
hoffa
case,
they
have
taken
the
possession
that
there
was
no
constitutional
violations
when
the
co-defendant
was
bugged
one
day
prior
to
the
return
of
the
indictment.
of
course,
that
case
has
been
submitted
there
now,
but
the
government
did
take
the
possession
there
that
there
was
no
fifth,
sixth,
or
fourth
amendment
violation.
thank
you.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
united
states
versus
james
a.
white
is
not
a
case
of
consensual
eavesdropping.
the
record
below
and
the
government’s
own
statement
of
facts
and
its
free
from
the
merits
do
not
support
the
contention
that
there
was
consent
by
the
informant
in
this
case.
this
issue
was
raised
by
the
respondent
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
stated
in
their
en
banc
opinion
that
they
did
not
reach
the
issue
of
consent
because
they
did
not
feel
that
it
was
material.
the
government
in
their
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
their
statement
of
facts
stated
that
the
informant
consented.
in
our
brief,
in
our
position
i
call
to
their
attention
the
fact
that
the
record
did
not
support
consent
--
voluntary
consent.
interestingly
enough,
in
their
statement
of
facts
in
their
brief
on
the
merits,
there
is
no
claim
that
the
informant
voluntarily
consented.
on
friday,
i
received
the
reply
brief
where
the
government
argues
that
this
--
it
would
be
fair
for
this
court
to
infer
that
the
informant
acted
freely
and
voluntarily
because
he
work
for
the
government
for
about
eight
days.
of
course,
the
first
day
work
was
when
the
first
situation
of
the
electronic
eavesdropping
took
place.
the
government
quotes
from
a
district
of
columbia,
district
court
case
united
states
versus
sorkin.
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that
case.
however,
the
only
thing
that
case
held
was
that
if
the
informant
hoped
that
there
were
be
leniency
if
he
cooperated,
this
did
not
necessarily
mean
that
he
involuntarily
consent
it.
but
the
court
stated
that
if
the
government
promise
leniency
or
if
they
went
out
and
found
a
weak
person
or
a
vulnerable
person
and
turned
them
into
informants,
they
would
restraint
this
use
because
this
--
the
record
would
not
support
a
finding
or
voluntary
consent.
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
consent
in
type
of
cases
should
be
decided
just
like
consent
in
any
ordinary
search
and
seizure
case.
now,
the
government’
failure
or
tires
to
excuse
this
failure
to
sustain
its
burden
of
proving
consent
by
saying
that
the
defense
never
raise
the
consent
issue
at
trial.
well,
i
submit
that
it
was
raised
a
trial
and
that
the
court
ruled
because
there
was
an
objection
to
the
evidence.
there
was
a
motion
the
strike
all
the
evidence
obtained
by
the
eavesdropping.
the
government
cited
a
number
of
cases
to
the
trial
judge
on
lee,
lopez
case,
and
a
number
of
seventh
circuit
cases.
every
case
cited
was
a
situation
where
there
was
consent.
the
trial
court
then
just
stated
that
we’ve
been
through
this
before
and
overall
the
motion
to
strike.
we
submit
that
it’s
the
government’s
burden
whenever
they
rely
upon
consent
to
sustain
the
lawfulness
of
a
search
and
seizure
but
the
burden
is
upon
them
to
prove
consent.
this
court
in
bumper
versus
north
carolina
held
and
i
just
give
a
short
quote,
“when
a
prosecutor
seeks
to
rely
upon
consent
to
justify
the
lawfulness
of
a
search
he
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
consent
was
in
fact
freely
and
voluntarily
given.
the
court
further
--
this
court
further
said
that
acquiescence
is
not
sufficient
consent.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
of
course
bumper
involved
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
bumper
course
involved
the
lady
that
let
the
policeman.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
of
course
she
was
the
defendant.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
but
if
i
think
what’s
very
important
is
that
if
this
case
would
be
reversed,
it
would
allow
the
government
to
coerce
people
to
become
informant,
it
would
all
them
and
give
them
authority
to
get
the
people
to
put
this
type
above
and
go
in
and
talk
to
anybody
trying
--
well,
just
violate
their
privacy
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
of
course,
since
the
informant
didn’t’
testify
in
this
case,
we
don’t
know
want
happened
and
i
think
this
is
very
important.
in
other
words,
if
the
informant
had
testified
and
there
had
been
cross-examination
maybe
the
record
would
have
showed
that
he
was
a
voluntary
agent
that
they
didn’t
go
out
and
say,
now
if
you
don’t
do
this
you’re
going
to
be
charged
with
some
particular
crime.
but
the
way
the
record
is
right
now,
the
way
the
record
stands,
we
don’t
know?
mr.
john
l.
boeger
the
consent
that
this
court
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
in
an
electronic
eavesdropping
case?
no.
lopez
was
of
course
an
agent.
on
lee
case
was
paid
informer.
maybe
some
of
the
other
cases,
the
point
just
wouldn’t
raised.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
i
agree
that
the
record
does
sustain
that
and
he
did
it
and
that
he
knew
the
battles
on
it.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
i
believe
that’s
right
and
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
i
think
the
answer
is
when
there’s
a
search
and
seizure
and
the
government
attempts
to
sustain
it
because
of
consent
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
it’s
up
to
them
to
prove
it.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
no
that
the
informant
consented.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
think
if
this
isn’t
required
of
this
court
in
its
opinions
that
it
would
give
the
government
authority
to
coerce
people
to
become
informants
and
bug,
who
knows.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
think
that
whole
scale
eavesdropping
by
the
government
could
probably
be
one
of
the
most
serious
problems
of
this
country
because
it
could
suppress
first
amendment
rights
of
all
citizens
not
just
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
individual
defendants.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
no,
i
think
that
might
be
a
little
different
situation.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
you
mean
if
the
informant
is
quite
guilty
but
haven’t
been
sentenced
yet?
mr.
john
l.
boeger
yes,
and
i
was
under
the
impression
that
the
laws
the
way
it
stood
now
that
if
a
person
enter
a
plea
of
guilty
for
the
reason
that
he
was
promised
a
certain
sentence
that
this
would
be
involuntary.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
think
it
might
fall
down
to
that.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
in
this
case,
your
honor,
i
think
of
course
the
government’s
reply
brief
on
what
an
informant,
why
he
might
be
motivated
to
carry
device,
i
think
are
there
may
be
cases
in
which
the
informant
was
pressured
to
such
an
extent
as
deprive
him
of
his
freewill.
the
failure
of
informant
to
be
on
that
witness
stand
and
the
failure
of
the
respondent,
defense
counsel
to
cross-examine
that
person
is
why
we
have
this
consent
problem
before
the
court
right
now.
so
i
think
that’s
a
reliability
problem.
and
i
think
the
court
should
not
do
away
with
the
right
if
cross-examination.
i
like
to
bring
out
one
--
what
i
think
is
probably
the
most
important
think
of
the
entire
case.
the
government
states,
it
gives
a
number
of
reason
why
electronic
eavesdropping
is
important
to
them.
it’s
protection
for
secret
agents
number
of
things.
well,
of
course
they
could
have
protection
for
their
agents
and
still
not
introduce
the
evidence
at
the
trial.
and
of
course
if
they
don’t
and
haven’t
used
the
evidence
in
any
way
then
it
didn’t
taint
the
conviction
and
so
there’s
no
problem.
but
nowhere
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
that’s
possible
if
they
don’t
have
the
evidence.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
they
did
use
its
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
and
of
course
it
tainted
the
conviction.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
don’t
think
there
is
any
doubt
that
when
they
--
if
the
evidence
was
unlawfully
obtained,
then
of
course,
i
think
that
does
taint
a
conviction
of
its
use
at
all
i
think
under
the
silverthorne
lumber
case.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
oh!
absolutely
not,
i
think
anytime
the
government
uses
an
electronic
device
that
they
must
get
a
warrant.
the
government
wants
all
people
in
the
united
states
to
trust
their
discretion,
agents
all
over
the
county,
their
discretion
on
who
to
bug,
when
to
bug,
why
to
bug
them,
they
even
say
in
their
brief
that
they
won’t
be
able
to
do
it
without
probable
cause
so
they
do
it
on
rumor.
they
give
no
reason
on
their
brief
why
they
have
to
do
this
without
getting
judicial
authority.
there
has
to
be
and
there
should
be
some
judicial
control
over
host
sale
eavesdropping.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
your
honor?
mr.
john
l.
boeger
there’s
no
doubt
i
think
that
katz
takes
care
of
my
problem.
i
think
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
yes.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
think
katz
overrules
on
lee
but
it’s
factually
a
little
different
situation
on
the
facts
its’
not
on
all
force.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
katz
is
on
all-force
factually
with
on
lee.
this
case
is
on
all
force
with
on
lee
because
on
on
lee
there
was
--
we’ve
gone
into
previously
on
lee,
there
was
consent.
there
was
a
paid
informant.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
desist
is
an
attempt
by
the
government
to
have
this
court
apply
a
1969
case
to
apply
it
retroactively
so
that
katz
which
is
a
1967
case
can’t
be
applied
here?
mr.
john
l.
boeger
desist
was
1969.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
bugging
was
in
late
‘65
and
early
’66.
now,
katz
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
it
doesn’t
say
everything.
it
says
that
to
the
extent
katz
departed
from
previous
holdings
of
this
court.
it
should
be
given
wholly
prospective
application.
i
submit
that
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
that
the
seventh
circuit’s
judgment
is
not
in
conflict
with
any
prior
decision
of
this
court,
and
this
is
exactly
what
the
seventh
circuit
en
banc
opinion
states.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
but
desist
came
after
the
judgment
in
this
case.
actually
desist
which
relies
upon
the
stovall
case,
stovall
came
after
the
bugging
and
after
the
trial
of
this
case.
whereas
the
linkletter
case
which
the
court
had
followed
linkletter
or
would
follow
linkletter
here,
katz
case
would
apply
because
the
white
case
was
on
direct
appeal
at
the
time
of
this
court’s
decision
in
katz.
the
government
has
stated
that
the
informant
was
unavailable
at
trial.
well,
in
checking
the
record,
you’ll
see
at
page
39
of
the
printed
appendix
that
the
trial
was
in
november
1966.
the
agents
testified
that
they
looked
at
the
informant’s
home
in
july
and
august
couldn’t
find
him.
they
checked
the
missing
persons
list
and
the
like
company
and
then
the
question
was
asked,
“did
you
go
any
other
places?”
and
at
page
40
of
the
appendix,
the
agent
said,
“no,
this
is
all
the
checking
we
did.”
so
they
didn’t
even
check
in
september
and
october
and
parts
of
november
to
see
if
they
could
find
the
informant.
respondent
submits
that
there
are
additional
reasons
for
affirming
the
seventh
circuit’s
judgment
and
that
in
the
exercise
of
this
court’s
supervisory
powers.
this
conduct
of
the
agents,
we
submit
was
in
violation
or
illinois
states
statutes.
there
had
been
an
earlier
case
in
the
illinois
state
by
the
illinois
state
supreme
court,
people
versus
dixon
that
had
approved
the
telephone
extension,
an
agent
listening
on
the
telephone
extension.
however,
i
don’t
think
that
that
case
necessarily
mens
that
the
type
of
bugging
involved
in
white
would
have
been
legal.
and
then
in
people
versus
kurth,
another
illinois
supreme
court
case
which
was
decided
before
trial
of
this
case.
the
illinois
supreme
court
said
that,
“our
statute
it’s
immaterial
whether
or
not
there’s
consent
or
not.
it’s
illegal.”
so
this
isn’t
a
lopez
situation
because
here
the
agents
the
conduct
was
unlawful.
the
agents
knew
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
had
held
that
bugging
without
a
warrant
or
just
bugging
without
consent
was
illegal.
and
they
went
ahead
and
did
it
anyway.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
on
lee,
the
agent
or
the
secret
informant
was
a
paid
informant.
the
court’s
opinion
does
not
say
specifically
whether
or
that
we
make
a
finding
of
consent.
but
i
think
in
reading
the
opinion
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
the
informant
that
there
was
consent
by
the
informant.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
submit
that
that
would
be
the
same
as
the
silverman
case.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
that’s
exactly.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
that
would
be
an
actual
intrusion
in
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
yes,
in
other
words
there
would
be
an
actual
intrusion
into
the
constitutionally
protected
area.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
sir?
mr.
john
l.
boeger
the
defendant.
in
other
words
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
a
bug
being
in
the
constitutionally
protected
area
without
a
warrant,
without
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
i
think
under
silverman,
if
there
is
an
invasion
into
the
constitutionally
protected
area,
it’s
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
or
at
the
very
least,
if
it’s
an
actual
intrusion,
it’s
certainly
under
the
supervisory
powers
of
this
court
that
the
silverman
they
say
would
not
permissible
to
use
that
evidence.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
of
a
bug.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
knowingly,
i
believe
that
he
knew
it.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
right.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
would.
that,
i
think
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
think
would
be
the
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
think
the
government
can
hire
undercover
agents
all
i
ask
is
that
just
as
this
court
stated
in
osborn,
discussed
in
the
burger
case,
is
that
they
go
to
a
judge
and
let
him
decide
whether
or
not
it
would
be
proper
to
use
an
electronic
eavesdropping
device.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
don’t
think
the
court
needs
to
go
that
far
in
this
case.
but
i
--
that’s
my
own
feeling.
in
other
words,
that’s
also
similar
to
the
lewis
case
but
lewis,
the
government
admitted
that
we
did
not
put
an
informant
into
the
house
to
see
or
hear
anything.
we
didn’t
--
we
weren’t
eavesdropping
at
all.
we
just
went
in
there
to
pick
up
a
package
and
leave.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
it’s
--
i
think
it’s
the
same
thing
as
somebody
committed
murder
and
the
murder
weapon
is
in
the
defendant’s
home.
they
still
must
and
should
get
a
warrant
before
they
break
down
the
door
and
go
on
get
that
murder
weapon.
now,
it
may
be
better
that
if
they
had
that
murder
weapon
and
run
a
ballistic
test
on
it
but
then
the
defendant’s
fingerprints
were
on
the
gun
and
no
one
else’s
that
that
might
be
better
evidence.
but
this
court
has
held
on
numerous
occasions
that
they
still
must
get
judicial
authority
before
they
break
down
somebody’s
door.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
think
when
it,
you
get
to
a
point
where
they
have
a
prospective
defendant.
certainly,
in
this
case,
there
were
eight
days
so
maybe
along
with
that
--
somewhere
along
the
line
they
thought
they
have
their
man.
so
i
think
when
they
use
an
informant
in
this
situation
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
i
suppose
they
have
some
sort
of
investigation
prior
to
that
but
i
don’t
know.
the
defense
counsel
tried
to
cross-examine
the
agents
regarding
their
relationship
with
the
informant
prior
to
the
date
of
the
first
transaction
and
the
defense
counsel
wouldn’t
allow
it
to
go
into
that.
i
think
one
of
the
comments
by
the
trial
judge
was
that
the
informant
is
not
on
trial
here.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
here
is
not
just
the
legality
of
a
search
and
seizure.
the
issue,
of
course,
is
combination
of
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
and
then
the
use
of
that
evidence
in
a
federal
criminal
trial.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
this
would
be
--
while
the
–
oh,
let's
take
the
situation
of
the
informant.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
of
course,
i
think
he
seizes
words
in
effect.
now,
whether
that
is
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure,
that's
a
different
question
than
what's
involved
in
the
electronic
eavesdropping
cases,
but
i
mean,
he
actually
has
the
words.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
yes,
again
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
it's
unreasonable,
but
i
think
when
someone
looks
with
their
eyes
at
something
in
plain
view,
that's
a
seizure
and
then
goes
over
and
picks
up
the
material,
that's
a
seizure.
of
course,
it's
a
question
of
whether
seizing
something
in
plain
view
is
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
no,
not
in
this
case.
and
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
no,
we
haven't
argued
that
point.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
that's
the
only
–
as
i
understand
it,
this
is
the
only
ruling
by
the
court
of
appeals
and,
of
course,
the
only
thing
raised
by
the
government
in
the
petition
for
cert,
and
of
course
it's
the
only
thing
that
we
have
raised.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
do
not
think
there
is
a
meaningful
distinction
between
whether
the
overhearing
occurred
in
the
informant's
home
or
whether
it
occurred
in
the
defendant's
home.
i
think
the
social
interest
and
the
policy
regions
behind
the
fourth
amendment
still
requires
and
should
require
that
there'd
be
judicial
control
whenever
an
individual
has
an
electronic
device,
listening
device
on
his
person
and
then
engages
someone
else
in
conversation.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
of
course
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
it
has
--
that
is
the
important
thing.
of
course,
our
cases
aren't
just
cut
and
dried
as
others
and
therefore
--
for
example,
its
my
contention
which
actually
doesn't
have
to
be
made
in
this
case
that
actually
the
government
obtaining
warrants
before
they
electronically
eavesdrop,
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
this
electronic
surveillance
should
be
permitted,
but
this
court
has
indicated
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
electronic
eavesdropping.
of
course,
this
court
has
indicated
and
osborn,
the
berger
case
and
the
katz
case,
that
if
we
are
going
to
allow
the
search
and
seizure
that
shouldn't
be
done
without
a
warrant,
i
think
there
are
good
reasons
for
not
permitting
the
electronic
surveillance
at
all
even
with
the
warrant.
but
apparent
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
think
there
is
good
constitutional
reasons
based
upon
the
holding
of
this
court
many
years
ago
in
the
boyd
case.
in
boyd,
this
court
held
that
the
government
could
not
subpoena
private
papers
of
the
individual.
the
court
treated
the
case
as
a
criminal
case,
i
believe
it
was
a
custom's
violation
forfeiture
case.
the
court
held
that
the
government
couldn't
even
subpoena
through
judicial
processes,
private
papers.
now
the
only
distinction
between
that
and
the
electronic
eavesdropping
is
that
in
one
case
the
individual
put
his
thoughts
down
on
the
paper
whereas
here
in
the
white
case,
the
individual
spoke
his
thoughts.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
of
course,
that’s
what
this
court
held
in
the
hoffa
case.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
in
my
opinion,
it
isn’t
but
i
think
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
no,
because
a
person
maybe
and
this
court
has
held
in
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
and
i
will
accept
that
he
takes
a
risk
that
this
person
might
repeat
what
he
said.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
think
it
is,
but
apparently
this
court
ruled
otherwise
in
hoffa.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
and
lewis.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
think
it
is,
but
i
think
the
court
has
held
otherwise
in
hoffa
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
no,
i
don’t
think
so
because
i
think
the
electronic
surveillance
is
then
an
addition
to
the
what
intrusions
are
already
been
made.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
for
purposes
of
this
case
i'll
concede
that.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
right
and
of
course,
anytime
there
is
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
you
still
have
to
prove
--
show
taint.
government
in
it’s
right
ironically
takes
a
possession
that
electronic
surveillance
is
very
necessary
in
the
fight
against
crime
and
in
federal
and
state
law
enforcement,
but
the
ironic
part
about
it
when
you
start
examining
cases
where,
the
government
has
had
to
admit
that
the
electronic
surveillance
was
illegal.
then
when
this
court
has
ordered
hearings
in
lower
courts
to
the
determine
taint,
it
always
ends
up
for
almost,
while
a
large
percentage
of
the
time,
they
have
never
use
the
electronic
surveillance
and
this
is
even
in
situations
where
defendants
have
been
overheard,
discussing
the
case,
discussing
facts
concerning
the
allegations
and
the
indictment.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
yes,
your
honor.
as
i
understand
this
court’s
rulings
and
desist,
it
was
that
katz
is
prospective
as
to
--
i
don’t
know
--
things
that
katz
departed
from
in
previous
holdings.
i
don’t
think
the
seventh
circuit's
holdings,
of
course,
the
seventh
circuit
found
in
its
en
banc
opinion
that
this
was
a
fourth
amendment
violation
regardless
of
whether
they
considered
katz.
now,
it’s
pretty
difficult,
but
maybe
this
case
needs
to
be
--
we
turn
back
the
hands
of
time
and
have
the
court
consider
this
case
as
the
law
was
before
katz.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
yes.
and
of
course,
the
government
relies
on
hoffa
and
lewis
and
they
don’t
want
us
to
use
katz,
but
hoffa
and
lewis
were
decided
before
eavesdropping
in
this
case.
also
at
the
time,
of
course,
that
the
seventh
circuit
rendered
it’s
opinion,
desist
had
been
handed
down
by
this
court.
therefore,
i
think
more
properly
linkletter
should
apply
in
this
situation.
and
linkletter
would
apply
katz
because
the
white
case
was
on
direct
appeal
at
the
time
katz
was
decided.
this
isn't
a
2255
situation
coming
up
years
later.
this
is
something
that
was
objected
to
a
trial
and
taken
on
up
thorough
the
appellate
process.
we
submit
that
this
court
should
not
give
it’s
judicial
blessing
to
uncontrolled
electronic
eavesdropping
by
the
government.
no
where
in
this
brief
does
the
government
suggest
a
reason
why
they
have
to
electronically
eavesdrop
on
conservations
without
some
judicial
controls.
certainly,
in
this
case
it
went
on
for
many
days
and
currently
there
is
no
argument
that
a
judge
wasn’t
available
which
sometimes
happens
on
mid-night
searches
in
narcotics
cases.
but
if
this
court
should
reverse
this
case,
it’s
going
to
permit
the
government
to
electronically
eavesdrop
on
conversations
that
the
speaker
thinks
are
private,
that
they
are
not
going
to
be
electronically
recorded
or
transmitted
to
others.
of
course,
since
the
government
argues
that
they
should
be
able
to
do
this,
not
only
without
a
warrant,
but
without
even
probable
cause,
but
on
rumor
alone
i
think
the
chances
of
abuse
are
enormous.
it
not
only,
in
our
opinion,
would
be
a
violation
of
the
victim’s
fourth
amendment
rights,
but
it
would
be
a
suppression
of
first
amendment
rights
of
all
citizens
in
the
united
states.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
in
other
words
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
that
is
my
opinion,
i
do
think
that
the
court
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
i
think
this
court
has
indicated
in
katz
and
then
osborn,
berger
that
they
will
permit
it
if
there
is
a
judicial
control,
something
like
a
warrant.
now
there
have
been
arguments
made
that
it
might
be
impossible
to
draft
a
statute
in
such
a
way
to
get
away
from
a
general
search
for
evidence.
i
guess,
we'll
have
to
wait
and
see
if
and
when
a
case
ever
comes
up
on
this
new
statute.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
if
the
informant
has
a
recorder
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
if
they,
assuming
that
they
put
it
in
the
evidence
at
the
trial.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
because,
again
i
think
the
fourth
amendment
requires
that
before
this
type
of
evidence
be
permitted,
that
they
obtain
a
warrant.
and
of
course,
in
this
case
you
have
the
additional
problem
of
the
informant
not
even
testifying
trial
and
this
is
significant
for
two
reasons.
first,
of
course,
you
are
unable
to
cross
examine
the
informant,
but
secondly,
evidence
was
introduced
in
this
case
which
was
hearsay.
in
other
words,
the
agents
overheard
conversations
made
by
the
defendant
and
the
informant.
the
agent
testified
to
what
he
heard
the
informant
say.
now
that’s
clearly
hearsay.
certainly,
there
is
no
way
that
you
could
cross
examine
the
informant.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
it’s
not
hearsay.
i
just
think
the
fourth
amendment
requires
a
warrant
in
that
situation.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
electronic
overhearing?
mr.
john
l.
boeger
no,
not
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
electronic
eavesdropping.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
no
and
that's
a
situation
of
course
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
electronic
surveillance
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
unless
there
is
a
warrant.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well
for
one
thing
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
think
if
all
the
cases,
all
the
decisions
of
this
court
run
out
of
katz
or
rather
that
there
is
no
case
directly
in
point
with
this
case,
therefore,
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion
is
not
contrary
to
any
previous
decision
of
this
case.
for
that
reason,
the
appellee,
the
respondent
to
this
case
does
not
need
katz
in
order
to
prevail.
we
have
another,
i
suppose
the
closest
case
is
of
course
the
on
lee
case
which
--
i
do
not
know
if
the
government
is
arguing
that
on
lee
is
still
good
law
or
whether
they
are
not,
but
certainly
on
lee
was
consensual
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
maybe
it
did
and
maybe
it
did
not.
i
do
know
that
katz
says
that
overruled
goldman
and
the
olmstead
case.
mr.
justice
brennan
in
his
dissent
in
lopez
said
that
goldman,
olmstead
and
on
lee
should
be
overruled.
well,
i
think
it
is
certainly
clear
that
katz
overruled
olmstead
and
goldman.
it
did
not
specifically
state
the
opinion
that
they
are
overruling
on
lee.
i
suppose
this
case
presents
that
issue
clearly.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
electronic
eavesdropping,
your
honor?
mr.
john
l.
boeger
i
mean,
you
mean
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
my
personal
opinion
is
that
the
use
of
informants
and
certainly
use
of
the
informants
quite
often
entails
coercion
on
that
person,
addicts.
i
think
better
practice
would
be
that
there
be
a
warrant
before
you
take
someone
in
to
go
in
and
elicit
statement
from
someone.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
no,
but
certainly
that's
not
an
informant
type
of
situation
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
no,
i
am
not
taking
the
position,
i
am
not
taking
the
position
that
all
eavesdropping
--
just
all
eavesdropping
requires
a
warrant.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
electronic
eavesdropping.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
of
course,
back
then
when
it
was
written,
they
didn't,
i
guess,
have
such
things
as
electronic
bugs
and
that
might
be
the
reason
why
it's
not
specifically
stated
in
the
fourth
amendment.
of
course,
there
had
been
some
dispute
in
the
past
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
that's
right,
there
has
actually
been
some
dispute.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
this
apparently
is
what
this
court
has
held
certainly
in
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
now,
we
submit
that
whether
or
not
there
was
a
voluntary
government
agent,
in
other
words,
whether
or
not
the
informant
consented
to
the
placement
of
the
bug
on
his
person
is
a
legally
significant
issue.
however,
if
this
case
is
reversed,
it
will
permit
the
government
to
go
out,
coerce
people
to
put
the
bug
on
their
person
and
then
engage
people
in
conversation
and
record
what
they
say.
i
think
this
would
be
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
yes,
and
apparently
although
the
government
says
this
is
necessary
in
their
fight
against
crime,
they
have
been
doing
it
for
years
and
organized
gambling
are
still
going
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
apparently,
it
is
going
on.
i
think
in
the
long-run
that
the
use
of
coerced
informant,
placing
the
bugs
on
them
that
this
is
going
to
be
close
to
what
george
orwell
wrote
about
in
1984
which
is
only
14
years
away.
i
think
it
will
cause
people
to
clam
up,
they
aren't
going
to
cooperate
with
the
police,
probably
people
don't
cooperate
with
the
police
as
much
now
as
they
used
to.
they
are
afraid
of
the
police.
they
are
going
to
be
afraid
that
everyone
they
are
talking
to
is
bugged
and
i
am--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
that's
i
think
we
all
want
to
go
off
the
record
every
once
in
a
while.
mr.
john
l.
boeger
no,
i
represent
the
respondent.
i
just
have
one
--
mr.
john
l.
boeger
well,
i
just
really
only
have
one
short
comment,
your
honor.
although
the
government
is
apparently
stating
that
they
are
not
urging
that
they
be
permitted
to
use
this
type
of
electronic
bug
to
obtain
statements
or
confessions
of
past
events,
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
effect
of
a
reversal
here
might
permit
just
that
because
in
the
sixth
circuit,
just
very
recently
in
the
hoffa
case,
they
have
taken
the
possession
that
there
was
no
constitutional
violations
when
the
co-defendant
was
bugged
one
day
prior
to
the
return
of
the
indictment.
of
course,
that
case
has
been
submitted
there
now,
but
the
government
did
take
the
possession
there
that
there
was
no
fifth,
sixth,
or
fourth
amendment
violation.
thank
you.
