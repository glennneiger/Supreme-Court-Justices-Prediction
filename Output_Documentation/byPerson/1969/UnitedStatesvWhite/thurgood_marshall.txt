justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
informant
didn’t
testify
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
a
distinction
between
that
in
regard
to
lewis?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
that
you
did
not
put
in
all
of
the
conversations.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
there
is
difference
if
the
government
picked
and
choose
what
the
wanted
to
put
in.
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
if
the
man
was
testifying,
he’d
have
to
testify
everything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
would
under
cross-examination.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they’re
on
gross
weight.
it
is
no
possibility
of
cross-examination
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
there’s
no
way
of
finding
out
whether
this
informant
was
a
paid
informant
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
what
his
relation
was
to
the
government?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
he
was
on
the
stand
he
would
be
obliged
to
explain
all
of
that,
wouldn’t
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
since
he
couldn’t
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
see
your
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
general
wilson’s
point
as
where
this
man
was
voluntary
or
not,
he
did
on
eight
separate
times,
put
one
of
these
things
in
his
pocket
and
agreed
to
cooperate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
as
to
your
client’s
right,
the
respondent’s
rights,
how
are
they
violated
by
the
agent’s
right
is
being
violated?
i
think
that’s
the
government
position.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
can
you
answer
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
do
you
think
the
government
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
the
government
had
assured
the
respondent
consented
to
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
katz?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
katz?
are
you
talking
about
today?
doesn’t
katz
take
care
of
your
problem
in
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
general
wilson,
do
you
say
that
as
form
now
on,
you
want
us
to
say
the
government
does
not
have
to
get
a
warrant
suggested
in
burger
and
katz?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
mean
that
as
to
narcotics
cases?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
far
do
you
want
to
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
fourth
amendment,
how
far
do
you
want
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
far
do
you
want
us
to
go
on
this
exception?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
suppose
the
informant--
excuse
me
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
the
informer
had
a
concealed
tape
recorder,
is
that
eavesdropping?
justice
thurgood
marshall
concealed
in
the
kitchen,
which
recorded
the
whole
sale
of
the
narcotics,
would
the
tape
on
that
recorder
be
any
good?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
it
would
be
inadmissible?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
do
agree
that
the
recording
wouldn’t
be
hearsay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
also
requires
a
warrant
for
any
overhearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
any
type?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
keep
saying
eavesdropping.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
mean,
neither
the
informant
nor
the
device
or
it
was
underneath
that
was
right
there
in
front
of
it
when
eavesdropping,
you
get
another
name?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
electronic
surveillance
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
are
getting
back
to
mr.
justice
white's
point.
you
just
said
is
any
electronic
surveillance,
any
other
evidence
received
from
that
is
automatically
inadmissible?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
what
about
the
appellee's
position
that
they
never
had
an
opportunity
to
cross-examine
this
man?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
explanation
in
the
record
as
to
why
he
wasn't
produced?
