please
the

this
is
a
fourth
amendment
criminal
case
involving
a
conviction
for
the
sale
of
heroin
reversed
by
the
circuit
court
on
the
katz
case.
this
was
a
narcotic
agent
wired
for
--
with
a
kel
radio
without
a
search
warrant.
it
involved
the
purchase,
delivery,
payment
and
the
sale
of
heroin.
the
informer
to
negotiate
the
parties
was
not
available
to
testify
so
the
case
was
proved
altogether
out
of
government
agents.
one
of
them
whom
hid
on
the
closet
and
others
heard
the
--
some
of
the
conversation
over
a
kel
radio.
in
all,
there
were
four
kitchen
meetings
in
the
home
of
the
informant
government
agent
type,
one
in
the
defendant’s
home,
two
in
the
informer’s
car
and
one
in
the
restaurant.
the
facts
are
that
on
december
9,
1965,
informant
harvey
jackson
met
in
his
own
kitchen
the
defendant
white.
at
that
time,
there
was
a
narcotics
agent
hiding
in
a
closet
where
he
could
see
in
here
the
events
in
the
kitchen
and
the
informant
had
on
him
a
kel
radio
which
is
a
short-range
radio
and
there
was
a
narcotics
agent
in
the
car,
a
short
distance
away
from
the
house
listening
to
the
conversation.
at
that
time,
there
was
a
delivery
of
one
ounce
of
heroin.
on
december
the
10th,
there
was
another
such
meeting
at
which
the
same
setup
with
the
--
at
which
time
the
informant
paid
a
thousand
dollars
and
agreed
to
purchase
some
additional
heroin
the
next
day.
on
december
the
14th,
the
informant
went
to
defendant
white’s
home
also
with
a
radio
on
him
and
went
in
and
paid
the
defendant
in
his
home
and
agreed
to
purchase
two
additional
ounces,
at
that
time
a
government
agent
was
outside
listening
to
the
conversation.
on
december
the
16th
of
1965
in
the
informant’s
car,
the
informant
and
the
defendant
drove
for
two
hours
with
the
informant
having
on
him
a
kel
radio
and
with
agents
of
the
narcotic
bureau
following
the
car
and
listening
to
the
conversation.
in
that
series
of
events
the
defendant
took
the
informant’s
car
and
let
the
informant
out,
and
met
another
man
named
sam
minerva
who
gave
him
heroin
and
then
he
picked
up
the
informant
again.
on
december
the
18th,
back
in
informant
jackson’s
kitchen,
at
his
home
with
jackson
and
white
at
the
table,
the
agent
in
the
closet,
the
agent
outside
listening
to
the
radio,
there
was
paid
$1,250.00
on
the
transaction
by
jackson
to
white.
on
december
the
29th
of
1965,
white
met
the
informant
jackson
agreed
to
meet
him
at
lake
and
royal
street
in
chicago
each
drove
his
own
car.
white
walked
up
to
jackson’s
car
and
delivered
the
heroin
with
jackson
being
having
on
his
radio
and
the
agent
is
listening
from
some
distance.
on
january
the
5th,
in
the
informant
jackson’s
kitchen
with
the
same
setup,
white
--
jackson
paid
white
$1,300.00.
on
the
january
the
8th,
at
a
restaurant
called
the
luminar
restaurant
which
the
defendant
have
some
connection
with,
they
met,
discussed,
again
with
the
radio
on
and
the
narcotic
agent
outside
the
restaurant
listening
to
the
camera
--
conversation
agreed
to
meet
at
leg
in
well
street
and
purchased
three
things
of
heroin
for
$2500.00.
on
january
the
9th,
white,
the
defendant
drove
up
and
stopped
and
stayed
in
randall
street
where
he
was
met
by
minerva
delivering
the
narcotic
and
at
that
time
the
agents
close-in
and
made
the
arrest
and
the
case
was
completed.
so
to
recap,
there
were
four
meetings
in
informant
kitchen.
one
meeting
in
defendant’s
home,
two
meetings
in
informant’s
car,
one
meeting
at
the
luminar
restaurant
and
addition
to
that,
an
overhearing
on
the
telephone,
the
very
offset
of
the
katz
case
where
the
informant
called
the
defendant
and
permitted
the
agents
to
listen
in
on
his
end
of
the
telephone
through
the
same
receiver.
so,
let’s
look
first
at
what
questions
are
not
involved
in
this.
we
do
not
have
any
questions
of
the
fifth
or
sixth
amendment
because
this
is
not
the
overhearing
of
conversations
about
past
events
in
the
nature
of
admission
or
a
confession.
this
is
an
overhearing
of
the
actual
transaction
itself
and
there
is
no
recitation
relied
on
and
put
in
the
evidence
or
involved
here
that
would
involve
either
the
fifth
amendment
or
sixth
amendment
questions
in
the
sense
of
either
testifying
against
himself
as
to
past
events
or
the
right
to
counsel.
and
that
we
think
is
fairly
clear
if
you
consider
the
situation
involving
the
normal
condition
of
bank
lobby
now
where
there
is
a
hidden
camera
and
frequently
hidden
radio
or
recording
devices,
and
a
bank
robber
comes
in
and
triggers
the
camera
and
the
camera
records
the
actual
crime
itself
and
the
recording
device
or
radio
records
the
words
used
by
the
bank
robber
in
committing
the
crime.
i
think
no
one
would
seriously
contend
that
there
was
any
constitutional
question
in
the
fourth,
fifth,
or
sixth
involved
in
that
situation.
here
the
radio
was
substantially
the
same
thing,
a
broadcast
of
the
crime
itself
being
committed.
the
--
white’s
conversation
and
the
words
used
give
him
an
evidence
were
all
a
part
of
the
contract
and
sale,
a
commercial
transaction,
a
contract
and
sale
of
heroin.
this
is
not
a
crime
of
violence
or
any
other
kind
of
crime
except
a
commercial
transaction
and
it
is
by
law
made
illegal.
so,
the
--
as
far
as
the
informant’s
kitchen
and
car
is
concerned,
there’s
no
trespass
because
they
belonged
to
the
informant
who
invited
the
defendant
white
to
come
there
and
make
the
sale.
and
the
restaurant
was
a
public
place
and
defendant’s
home
was
no
trespassed
because
the
defendant
invited
the
informant
to
come
to
his
home
to
take
--
to
make
payment
for
the
narcotic.
all
of
that
is
pretty
well
governed
by
the
lewis
case.
now
that
brings
us
to
katz
which
is
you
all
know
is
the
bugging
of
a
telephone
booth
situation.
and
its
discussions
of
the
expectation
of
privacy
which
is
probably
the
central
question
that
the
court
will
be
concerned
with
in
this
situation.
and
so
we
could
ask
ourselves
what
legal
expectations
of
privacy
did
the
lower
court
to
defendant
white
when
he
went
to
defendant’s
jackson
--
to
jackson’s
kitchen
to
sell
narcotics.
certainly,
the
law
does
not
protect
white
against
the
other
part
of
the
transaction
testified.
this
is
a
--
as
i
said
this
is
a
bargain
and
sale,
a
contract
made
partly
in
words,
partly
by
the
passage
of
money,
and
partly
by
the
passage
of
the
narcotics,
the
delivery
of
narcotic.
and
whether
civil
or
criminal
either
side
can
testify
as
to
a
contract,
and
either,
in
any
type
of
case.
so
when
the
parties
enter
into
a
commercial
transaction
that
is
by
law
made
criminal.
either
party
can
testify
so
white
had
no
expectation
of
privacy
that
the
other
side
of
his
contract
wouldn’t
and
couldn’t
testify
to
it
as
he
had
a
perfect
legal
right
to
do.
and
then
there
is
in
the
situation
language
which
comes
in
that
i
think
needs
to
be
clarified
somewhat
and
that
is
this
coming
from
some
of
the
older
cases.
the
question
of
misplaced
confidences
between
the
seller
of
narcotics
who
is
selling
to
a
government
agent.
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
this
was
arm’s
length
transaction.
this
isn’t
a
--
there
wasn’t
any
relationship
of
confidence
between
this
two
people.
it’s
not
husband
and
wife,
lawyer-client,
or
doctor-patient,
a
priest-penitent,
anything
like
that.
this
is
a
sale
between
strangers
and
an
arm’s
length
sale.
and
one
of
the
risks
that
a
man
in
the
illegal
business
of
selling
narcotics
takes
is
that
some
of
his
customers
will
turn
to
out
to
be
government
agents.
and
he
knows
that
when
he
goes
in
the
business.
he
runs
that
risk
and
so
there
isn’t
any
misplaced
confidence
in
this
situation.
and
certainly
the
law
does
not
protect
white
against
either
the
fact
that
may
turn
out
to
be
a
government
agent
and
that
he
may
testify.
and
there’s
no
breach
of
duty
on
the
part
of
the
informant
in
this
situation.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
no
sir,
he
didn’t.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
yes
sir,
i
do
mr.
justice.
in
this
that
it
gives
to
the
policy
of
the
question
raised
by
the
former
chief
justice
in
his
dissent
in
one
of
this
cases
and
that
is,
can
the
government
use
the
recorded
or
secondary
testimony
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
when
the
informant
doesn’t
testify?
in
this
case,
we
could
not
and
find
the
informant
at
that
time.
and
it
is
--
it
becomes
then
i
guess
a
policy
question
as
to
where
there
the
government
should
or
should
not
be
able
to
use
the
testimony
at
that
time.
but
it’s
not
a
constitutional
question
because
the
constitutional
rights
are
determined
as
of
the
time
of
the
search
and
not
by
the
development
of
the
case.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
mr.
justice,
we
all
have
to
make
a
statement
later
which
we
will
make.
i
understood
that
they
did
put
them
all
in
but
i’m
not
clear
on
that
so
we
we’ll
clear
that
up.
i
didn’t
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
well,
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
no
sir,
he
wouldn’t.
he
would
have
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
under
cross-examination
but
not
under
direct
examination.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
no
possibility
when
it’s
not
produced
that’s
correct.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
well,
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
he
was
a
--
he
was
acting
for
the
government
over
a
considerable
period
of
time
here.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
no,
sir.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
but
i
can
say,
we
might
he
might
well
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
yes,
sir.
but
you
see
that
would
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
that
would
go
to
the
court
--
that
would
go
to
the
credibility
of
his
testimony
and
we’re
not
--
since
we’re
not
offering
him
the
credibility
of
his
testimony
is
not
an
issue.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
no,
sir.
they
--
i’ve
read
the
record
and
it
was
no
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
no,
sir.
we
did
not
refuse
it.
now,
as
to
the
agent
hiding
in
the
closet
i
see
no
constitutional
question
on
that
at
all.
as
to
the
kel
radio
which
is
the
central
question
before
the
court
here.
there’s
nothing
sinister
about
a
radio.
it’s
--
the
radio
is
a
common
part
of
our
life
now
used
in
all
types
of
communication
as
good
law
enforcement
technique.
it
increased
the
accuracy
of
proving
the
case.
it
helps
detect
the
safety
of
the
agent.
now,
one
of
the
things
that
we’re
concerned
with
is
in
this
narcotic
purchases,
that’s
a
rather
dangerous
business
for
the
agent.
and
if
he
is
in
there
and
needs
help,
the
agent
listening
on
the
outside
can
determine
that
and
come
in
once
long
go
at
lost
made
under
those
circumstances.
it
makes
it
better
development
of
all
aspects
of
the
case.
frequently,
on
a
propose
purchase
of
narcotics
when
the
agent
goes
in
to
an
apart
where
there
something
it
turns
out
that
he
negotiates
with
them.
they
don’t
have
it.
they
said,
they
say
you
wait
here
and
will
send
forth.
they
send
forth
and
if
the
agents
on
the
outside
have
the
intelligence
that
conversation
they
can
follow
the
man
and
get
his
source
and
take
him
to
where
he
is
going
for
it.
if
they
don’t
have
that,
they
may
arrest
--
i
mean,
make
their
arrest
prematurely
there,
their
raids
prematurely
and
they
do
not
have
a
smooth
development
of
the
case
that
they
do
using
the
kel
radio.
and
as
especially
true
in
the
business
of
following
the
cars,
it’s
difficult
to
follow
a
car
in
traffic.
if
they
do
not
have
a
radio
communication
in
tailing
the
car,
they
have
to
be
closer
to
it.
if
they
got
a
radio
communication
with
an
informant
from
the
car,
they
can
drop
back
and
have
a
great
deal
more
success
in
following
the
car
at
a
distance.
it
protects
the
defendant
against
falls
testimony.
these
narcotic
agents
nature
things
they
are
usually
addicts,
they
are
not
perhaps
the
most
reliable
people
in
the
world
in
many
ways.
and
this
gives
the
bureau
of
narcotics
a
check
and
a
protection
on
the
agent
himself
of
framing
a
defendant
when
they
can
listen
to
the
conversation
and
hear
it
all.
now
taking
the
subject
of
these
consensual
overhearings
direct,
we
take
the
flat
position
that
a
consensual
overhearing
where
one
party
to
a
conversation
consents
does
not
involve
fourth
amendment
problems.
just
recently
in
the
case
of
frazier
versus
cupp
which
was
a
search
and
seizure
case
involving
a
duffel
bag
where
two,
i
believe
it
was
a
murder
case,
had
hidden
the
clothes
that
they
wore
at
the
time
crime
in
a
duffel
bag.
and
one
of
the
defendants
gave
permission
to
the
officers
to
search
the
duffel
bag
without
a
warrant.
it
was
held
that
that
was
illegal
search
and
so
having
one
of
the
parties
having
consent,
the
search
was
legal
as
to
both
of
them
and
the
close
could
be
used
in
evidence
against
the
non-consenting
party
in
that
type
of
search.
well,
the
same
thing
would
apply
to
both
ends
of
a
telephone
conversation
or
radio
conversation
and
having
to
see
no
difference
between
the
overheard
telephone
conversations
in
this
case
and
the
overheard
radio
conversations.
they
were,
if
they
are
legal
without
a
warrant
on
the
fourth
amendment,
it’s
because
of
the
consent
of
one
of
the
parties
of
the
conversation
and
it
seems
to
me
they
are
the
same
thing.
it’s
almost
the
exact
opposite
of
the
situation,
the
katz
case
where
the
listing
device
was
put
in
on
without
the
consent
of
either
party
and
on
the
end
of
the
person
who
was
under
trial.
of
course,
the
court’s
familiar
with
the
lopez
case
where
and
irs
agent
went
into
a
bribe
situation.
i
may
say
that
the
government
uses
this
kel
radios
in
two
main
situations.
in
the
main,
one
is
for
narcotics
cases
and
the
second
is
for
bribery
case.
and
bribery
is
one
of
the
central
problems
in
government
as
everybody
knows.
now,
in
the
lopez
case,
irs
agent
went
in
with
the
recoding
device
and
i
personally
see
no
difference
between
a
recording
device
and
a
kel
radio
which
puts
it
outside
for
notes
or
recording.
and
it
was
held
there
in
an
arm’s
length
transaction.
no
confidential
relationship
between
a
government
agent
for
the
irs
and
the
taxpayer
that
there
was
no
expectation
of
privacy
in
that
situation.
and
that
bring
us
to
on
lee,
perhaps
one
of
the
earliest
of
these
cases.
in
on
lee
of
course
has
been
greatly
criticized
and
it
is
vulnerable
criticism
on
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
and
that
is
the
obtaining
by
stealth
of
confession
or
admission
after
the
event
which
is
on
lee
as
the
court
remembers,
the
narcotic
agent
went
into
the
laundry
and
the
agent
stayed
outside
after
the
case
have
been
made
and
after
indictment
and
it
raises
both
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
problems.
it
was
upheld
on
the
fourth
and
my
feeling
is
that
it
was
correctly
upheld
on
the
fourth.
again,
a
consensual
hearing
is
not
a
search
and
seizure
situation.
the
defendant
has
raised
questions
about
whether
this
is
a
true
consensual
case
based
upon
the
proof
track
court
found
that
informant
jackson
did
consent
and
we
have
covered
that
as
a
factual
matter
in
extensive
supplemental
brief.
now
to
reiterate
the
point
raised
a
few
minutes
ago
about
the
informant
himself
not
testified.
our
position
is
that
that’s
not
a
constitutional
point.
it
might
go
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
it
might
go
to
some
search
problem
as
best
evidence
but
it
doesn’t
goes
the
constitutionality
of
the
search
because
that
must
be
determined
as
of
the
time
of
the
search
and
not
by
subsequent
technical
developments
in
the
trial
itself.
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
well,
we
have
desist
as
a
second
point
and
we
urge
that
--
but
we
are
very
hopeful
of
not
reaching
that
we
can
prevail
on
our
first
and
fourth
amendment
point.
but
we
think
that
this
case
if
you
passed
that.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
well,
that’s
right.
we
have
in
our
brief
though.
i
don’t
know
intensively.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
well,
we
feel
that
this
is
a
katz.
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
don’t
know
that
i
fully
understand
my
way
around
all
of
the
desist
law
but
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
that
is
when
the
court,
i
don’t
see
it’s
what
amounts
in
new
constitutional
law
in
the
sense
of
overruling
and
accepting
the
position.
that
as
far
as
the
officers
are
concerned,
it
would
be
applied
only
to
their
acts
after
they
have
full
knowledge
of
the
new
law
in
fact
and
that
being
true
we
see
that
we
think
that
it
should
apply
here
and
especially
the
fact
that
this
is
such
widespread
device
and
used
so
throughout
law
enforcement
and
it’s
been
done
in
the
belief
that
it
was
not
a
search
warrant
situation.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
that’s
correct
your
honor.
we
sincerely
hope
that
the
court
can
see
it’s
way
to
right
on
this
point
rather
than
to
this
point
if
possible
because
it’s
one
that’s
vital
to
the
daily
work
of
law
enforcement
agencies
and
the
desist
point
is
the
matter
of
salvaging
a
case.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
just
two
points
i
want
to
get
briefly.
one
of
them
is
on
the
part
judge,
mr.
justice
marshall
raised
on
the
production
of
the
witness
that
we
form
at
the
trial.
if
we
are
required
to
do
that
and
can
only
use
the
evidence
when
you
have
informant
there
that
puts
the
premium
on
having
their
life.
and
in
this
situation,
the
best
policy
would
be
not
to
fix
it
where
if
the
informant
is
gone
you
can’t
try
the
man,
in
my
judgment.
and
secondly,
that
it
doesn’t
go
to
the
constitutionality
the
search
in
the
first
place.
and
the
other
thing
on
the,
i’ll
address
myself
directly
to
the
question
of
getting
a
search
warrant
in
this
situation?
this
type
of
radio
communication
is
used
right
from
the
inception
of
the
case
before
you
have
a
probable
cause
frequently
and
if
you
have
to
get
a
warrant
before
you
use
it,
it
will
prevent
the
building
of
proper
cause
and
secondly,
in
a
rapidly
developing
narcotics
sale,
the
agent
frequently
does
not
know
either
the
place
or
the
people
he
is
going
to
be
negotiating
with.
he
goes
and
gets
to
meet
somebody
in
a
street
car
and
gets
in
the
car
and
they
take
him
of
clear-cross
town
to
an
apartment
or
something
else
and
there
the
sale
is
consummated.
so
that
if
we
have
to
designate
either
the
place
or
the
people
to
be
searched
while
it
will
make
it
a
very
difficult
situation
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
kel
is
a
little,
a
very
small
radio
that
would
broadcast
about
three
miles.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
yes,
sir,
i
don’t
there’s
any
chance
of
inserting
it
on
someone
without
their
knowledge.
as
i
understand
it,
it’s
hidden
usually
around
the
chest
somewhere
to
pick
up
the
language.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
i
think
it
stays
on
most
of
the
time
he
is
there.
but
i
don’t
know
whether
he’s
got
--
that
i’ll
find
that
out.
in
short,
we
will
urge
the
court
that
in
the
interest
if
in
balancing
the
value
share,
you
got
the
value
in
the
privacy
is
raised
in
all
of
its
opinions
as
against
the
question
of
law
enforcement,
the
security
of
the
citizen,
the
sale
of
narcotics
which
is
increasingly
difficult
problem.
we
ask
that
the
in
the
definition
of
privacy
under
fourth
amendment
not
be
extended
in
this
situation
and
that
that
the
law
officers
be
continued
to
use
this
kel
radios
in
a
skillful
development
of
these
cases
as
a
top
problem
in
law
enforcement.
and
so
we
would
urge
the
court
to
hold
that
this
is
not
a
fourth
amendment
search
requiring
a
warrant
in
probable
cause
and
that
also
if
the
court
reaches
the
point
that
we
not
be
required
to
produce
the
witness
before
we
can
produce
the
evidence
in
this
situation
that
is
the
informer.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
no,
sir.
not
at
all.
i
said
in
this
situation.
you
see
we
contend
that
katz
does
not
apply
with
the
situation.
these
are
--
these
consensual
hearings.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
well,
yes.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
i
don’t
know
it
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
[voice
overlap]
just
one
another
but
that’s
the
principal
place
they
applied
in
narcotics.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
well,
it
--
what
we
would
like
for
the
court
to
hold
is
that
where
there
is
a
conversation
that
is
the
commission
of
the
crime
itself
as
distinguished
from
confession
on
admission
of
past
events
and
that
where
one
of
the
parties
of
the
conversation
consents
to
an
overhearing
by
government
agent
that
that
is
not
a
situation
requiring
a
search
warrant
on
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
reargument,
our
second
argument
of
this
case,
therefore,
i
am
going
to
assume
that
the
court
is
somewhat
familiar
with
the
case
and
i
point
out
that
it
involves
a
criminal
conviction
for
the
sale
of
heroin.
the
principal
law
point
center
in
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
investigatory
process
which
was
an
overhearing
by
radio
without
warrant.
there
are
other
issues.
the
first
issue
that
the
defendant
stresses
is
whether
the
informant
who
made
the
purchase
gave
his
consent
to
being
equipped
or
wired
with
a
radio
for
the
purpose
of
transmitting
the
interview.
the
second
issue
is
whether
there
were,
in
this
investigatory
process
a
search
and
seizure
which
required
a
warrant
where
no
warrant
was
issued,
therefore
go
to
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence
obtained.
the
third
issue
concerns
the
trial
procedure
where
the
informant
or
purchaser
did
not
himself
testify
and
the
case
was
made
exclusively
from
the
testimony
of
the
investigatory
agents
who
observed
the
transaction.
the
fourth
issue
is
the
retroactivity
of
the
katz
case
under
desist.
now
to
speak
briefly
to
the
consent
of
the
informant
or
the
purchaser
or
the
agent,
the
government's
position
is
that
the
whole
course
of
conduct
establishes
an
overwhelming
basis
for
the
consent
of
the
informant
to
have
a
radio
placed
on
him
and
to
go
through
with
the
transaction.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
it
was
called
the
kel
radio.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
transmitter
and
it's
put
on
the
chest
under
the
clothing
so
as
to
record
--
i
mean
to
pick
up
a
conversation.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
yes,
in
this
situation
most
of
the
interviews
have
occurred
in
the
home
of
the
agent
and
the
informant
and
the
two
of
the
government
agents
were
stationed
across
the
street,
it
will
transmit
for
a
mile
or
so.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
i
believe
it
was
the
car
or
another,
it
was
something
--
it
was
across
the
street
from
where
the
thing
occurred.
now
going
to
the
consent
of
the
informant
who
--
part
of
the
procedure,
he
met
the
agents
at
one
place
where
they
searched
him
to
determine
that
he
was
not
--
he
had
no
narcotics
and
all
of
these
informants
are
themselves
addicts
that
are
used
by
the
investigatory
body
to
make
the
purchase.
the
search
team
for
narcotics
found
that
he
had
not
on
him,
put
the
radio
on
him,
gave
him
money
and
then
went
with
him
to
his
home
where
one
of
the
informants
hid
in
a
closet
in
the
kitchen
of
the
--
i
mean,
one
of
the
government
agents
hid
in
a
closet
of
the
kitchen
and
the
other
two
were
across
the
street.
there
were
four
such
meetings
over
a
period
of
roughly
30
days
in
addition
to
a
telephone
conversation
that
was
overheard,
and
two
conversations
on
the
car
and
one
in
a
restaurant;
some
8
or
9
transactions
over
a
period
of
30
days
and
our
position
is
that
any
objective
viewing
of
this
course
of
conduct
would
establish
without
question
that
the
informant
did
consent
to
the
procedure
and
did
cooperate
with
it
in
the
sense
that
consent
is
an
element
in
a
consensual
overhearing.
the
informant's
name
was
harvey
jackson.
he
called
him
on
the
telephone.
in
addition
to
that
he
took
delivery
of
several
--
deliveries
of
heroin
which
he
in
turn,
turned
over
to
the
government
agents
and
he
accepted
from
the
government
agents
$1,000,
$1,350
and
$1,300
which
he
in
turn
paid
over
at
one
time
or
another
for
the
purchase
of
narcotics.
we
say
that
this
whole
course
of
conduct
establishes
that
the
informant,
harvey
jackson,
did
consent
in
the
sense
that
is
of
material
to
the
fourth
amendment
issue.
the
defendant
himself
in
his
arguments,
attacks
or
raises
questions
about
the
motivation
of
the
informant
for
consenting
and
we
say
that,
that's
wholly
immaterial
as
to
why
he
did
it,
but
now
getting
to
the
analysis
of
the
facts,
the
law
point
centered
around
the
fourth,
fifth,
and
sixth
amendment
questions,
and
i
want
to
give
you
--
take
the
set
of
facts,
typical
set
of
facts
and
go
through
them
and
analyzing
against
the
contentions
of
those
amendments.
harvey
jackson
met
three
government
agents
at
57th
and
outer
drive,
where
the
searched
him,
installed
a
radio,
gave
him
the
money
and
the
group
together
went
to
harvey
jackson's
home.
one
of
the
government
agents,
hid
in
a
closet
with
the
door
cracked
open
where
he
could
see
and
hear
the
transaction
that
was
about
to
take
place.
two
of
them
went
across
the
street.
the
defendant
white
came
in
the
back
door,
came
into
the
kitchen
of
the
government
informant.
they
sat
down
together.
there
was
a
commercial
transaction,
that
is,
an
offer
and
acceptance,
a
delivery
of
the
merchandise,
and
a
payment
for
it.
then
white,
the
defendant
got
up
and
left
and
after
that
jackson
turned
the
narcotics
over
to
the
government
agent
who
was
in
the
closet.
now
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
problem
in
this,
because
this
was
the
event,
this
was
the
crime
itself
and
there
is
no
confession
or
admission
involved
--
there
is
nothing
that
came
from
the
lips
of
the
defendant
referring
to
past
events.
so
there
can't
be
a
question
of
him
testifying
against
himself
in
this
question,
because
none
of
the
proof
involved
the
introduction
of
any
statements
by
the
defendant
with
reference
to
a
past
event.
all
of
them
are
to
a
current
event
which
is
a
commercial
transaction
of
the
crime
itself.
there
is
no
sixth
amendment
question
involved
in
this
because
he
was
not
under
arrest,
at
anytime
any
of
the
statements
were
made.
there
was
nothing
he
said
after
arrest
that
was
introduced
in
evidence
and
so
there
is
no
question
about
him
being
entitled
to
counsel
or
to
be
furnished
counsel
or
anything
like
that.
so
the
only
constitutional
question
as
i
see
it
that
could
be
involved
are
the
questions
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
thus
was
this
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
without
a
warrant?
now
first
taking
the
factual
situation,
the
narcotics
themselves,
the
existence
of
the
narcotics,
white
sold
the
narcotics
to
jackson,
the
government's
man
and
voluntarily
delivered
it
to
the
government
agent
in
his
own
kitchen,
generally,
or
in
his
own
automobile
in
other
situation.
after
white
parted
with
both
the
title
and
possessions
of
the
narcotics,
he
had
no
legal
rights
in
those
narcotics
at
all,
even
as
an
illegal
transaction.
jackson
could
do
anything
he
wanted
to
with
those
narcotics.
he
could
flush
them
down
the
toilet,
throw
them
out
of
the
window
or
give
them
to
a
government
agent
and
it
was
none
of
white's
business
what
jackson
did
with
those
narcotics.
so,
there
was
no
seizure
of
the
narcotics.
they
were
voluntarily
delivered
to
the
government
by
the
man
who'd
bought
them,
and
i
don't
see
that
there
could
be
any
question
about
there
being,
needed
a
warrant
to
get
the
possession
of
the
narcotics
come
out
of
the
situation.
now
let's
pass
to
the
agent
in
the
closet.
his
testimony
was
verbal.
he
was
put
on
by
direct
examination,
by
cross
examination.
when
defendant
white
went
to
another
man's
house
for
a
commercial
transaction,
he
had
no
legal
right
to
say
who
was
present
or
not
present.
the
man
who
owned
the
house
had
the
right
to
say
that.
and
so
consequently,
he
had
no
legal
right
to
an
expectation
of
privacy
that
there
wouldn't
be
anybody
else
in
his
customer's
house.
the
customer
had
a
right
to
bring
anybody
he
wanted
to
in
his
house,
and
he
had
a
right
to
hide
him
in
the
closet
if
he
wanted
to.
there
are
many
cases
that
hold
that.
to
hold
it
otherwise
would
be
to
make
the
event
itself
unprovable
with
direct
evidence.
and
there
wasn't
any
difference
between
a
witness
sitting
in
a
closet
who
eyeballs
this
transaction
and
sees
and
hears
the
transaction,
and
then
testifies
to
it
later,
then
a
witness
standing
on
the
corner,
who
sees
it
next
to
him
and
testifies
about
it
and
that's
not
a
search
and
seizure
problem.
and
so
there
is
no
question
of
there
being
any
necessity
for
a
warrant
to
introduce
the
testimony
of
the
eyeball
witness
to
the
transaction.
now,
let's
pass
to
the
agents
across
the
street
which
is
really
the
arguable
situation
here,
that
were
listening
in
on
the
radio
by
the
consent
and
invitation
of
harvey
jackson.
now
this
is
not
an
on
lee
situation
where
the
government
used
an
old
friend
after
indictment
of
the
defendant
to
extract
an
admission
or
confession
of
a
past
event
with
the
agents
listening
in
by
radio.
that's
not
this
situation.
here
the
agents
were
listening
to
event
itself
happen,
to
the
crime
being
committed
in
the
consummation
of
a
commercial
transaction
as
barred
below.
the
commission
of
the
crime
itself
is
not
protected
against
direct
proof
by
any
legal
expectation
of
privacy
and
i
think
that's
a
fundamental
statement.
you
cannot
go
into
the
commission
of
a
crime
with
the
expectation
of
privacy
that
you
won't
be
observed
or
the
proof
won't
be
offered.
consider
a
bank
robbery
situation,
where
the
bank
lobby
is
rigged
with
the
secret
camera
and
secret
radio
and
secret
recorder
to
obtain
good
proof
of
the
happening
of
the
bank
robbery.
does
this
require
a
search
warrant,
obviously
not.
it
would
be
wholly
impractical
to
require
the
bank
to
get
a
search
warrant
each
day
of
its
operation
and
there
they
might
have
a
robbery
that
day
and
there
would
be
no
proper
cause
and
lots
of
other
things.
but
the
use
of
electronics
to
record
the
happening
of
the
crime
in
a
bank
robbery
is
not
a
search
and
seizure
situation
requiring
a
warrant.
does
the
bank
robber
have
any
legal
expectation
of
privacy
which
shields
him
from
proof
of
the
event
itself,
by
any
direct
evidence,
either
electronically
recorded
or
otherwise,
obviously
not.
does
a
narcotic
peddler,
in
making
his
sale,
delivery
and
collection
of
money,
have
any
greater
legal
right
to
an
expectation
of
privacy
than
the
bank
robbery,
obviously
not,
he
should
not.
the
gathering
of
the
evidence
of
the
event
itself
with
either
camera
or
radio
or
any
other
electronic
device
should
not
require
a
warrant
in
either
situation.
the
fourth
amendment
protects
certain
places
and
certain
relations
and
certain
people.
let's
look
at
the
relationship
between
harvey
jackson
and
defendant
white.
it
was
that
of
a
buyer
and
seller
at
a
commercial
transaction.
it
was
not
a
confidential
relationship.
it
was
not
an
old
friend
as
in
the
chana
(ph)
case,
was
not
a
lawyer-client,
not
a
doctor-patient,
not
a
priest-penitent,
not
a
husband-wife,
it
was
not
a
relationship
that
would
be
protected
in
the
sense
of
a
right
of
expectation
of
privacy
out
of
the
relationship,
so
that
leaving
aside
the
place
altogether,
the
fourth
amendment
wouldn't
attach
to
that
relationship
of
a
commercial
transaction
which
is
it
by
law
illegal.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
as
i
remember,
he
went
into
public
phone-booth
and
he
shut
the
door.
now,
i
feel
like
that
the
katz
case
is
not
in
point
here
for
the
reason
that
when
he
went
in
that
phone-booth
and
paid
his
money
for
the
phone
call
and
shut
the
door,
he
had
a
right
of
expectation
of
privacy.
now
that's
not
our
situation
in
this
case.
in
the
katz
case
had
he,
for
instance,
not
gone,
had
it
been
one
of
these
phones
just
out
in
the
open
and
he
got
to
the
phone
out
in
the
open
and
made
his
call
and
bid
an
fbi
agent
stand
beside
him,
he
wouldn't
have
been
protected
against
the
privacy
of
that
because
he
didn't
expect
to
get
any
privacy.
he
expected
to
get
his
privacy
from
the
privacy
of
that
phone-booth.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
yes
sir,
that's
it.
i
will
come
to
the
telephone
in
a
minute
which
is
the
most
difficult
problem
of
our
brief
here.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
no,
sir.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
and
he
had,
he
took
the
man
with
him
in
the
phone-booth
and
man
did
not
electronically
listened
in.
he
simply
held
his
ear
up
near
the
receiver,
while
katz
was
–
while
the
informer
was
talking
to
the
defendant.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
he
did
not.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
the
katz
–
the
essential
difference
is
katz
is
not
really
a
consensual
case,
there
wasn't
any
consent
though
there
at
all
and
this
is
a
consensual
case
and
the
real
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
that's
--
and
that's
true
in
our
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
that's
right,
that's
right.
perhaps
my
statement
was
little
too
broad
on
that.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
yes
sir
and
the
man
who
was
overheard,
was
in
a
place
where
he
had
a
right
of
expectation
of
privacy
under
the
katz
decision.
our
statement
about
electronic
was
a
little
too
broad
on
that
scope.
now
let's
come
to
the
telephone
conversation,
where
the
court
will
recall,
jackson,
the
government
informant
went
to
the
telephone
and
called
the
defendant
white
for
the
purpose
of
making
his
date
to
pay
some
money.
and
he
took
with
him
a
government
agent
who
went
into
the
phone-booth
with
him
and
listened
by
holding
his
ear
up
close
to
the
telephone
and
he
listened
to
jackson
to
the
end
of
the
conversation
with
the
consent
of
jackson.
now
that
gets
closer
to
the
fourth
amendment
problem
in
my
judgment
than
anything
else
in
the
case,
at
this
juncture.
but
again,
it's
a
consent
case
and
you
should
take
the
rathbun
case
which
you
remember
is
the
telephone
extension
case,
where
the
man
was
listening
on
an
extension
of
the
telephone,
instead
of
listening
to
the
very
telephone
itself.
it
was
held
that,
that
was
not
a
warrant
situation.
and
we
see
really
little
difference
in
this
case
and
the
rathbun
case.
again,
i
point
out
that
what
the
agent
listened
to
was
not
an
admission
or
confession
and
so
there
is
no
fifth
or
sixth
amendment
and
only
a
fourth
amendment
problem
in
there.
it
was
not
a
wire
tap
and
it
was
not
an
uninvited
ear
because
he
was
invited
by
one
party
to
the
conversation.
and
we
see
really
no
difference
between
when
you
get
to
looking
at
it,
between
that
instant
in
the
telephone
booth
and
the
instant
of
the
radio.
now
there
was
a
car,
i
believe
were
two
cars
and
i
think
they
are
substantially
the
same
situation
as
the
others.
the
next
is
defendant
white's
home,
which
--
where
the
agent
went
by
himself,
but
equipped
with
the
radio
where
government
officers
could
listen
to
the
conversation
in
defendant
white's
home,
but
again
we
say
that
the
lewis
case,
squarely
holds
that
there
is
no
invasion
of
the
privacy
of
the
home
when
defendant
converts
his
home
to
a
commercial
use
by
selling
narcotics,
that's
the
square
holding
of
the
lewis
case
and
secondly,
you
have
got
the
consent
element
as
far
as
electronics
are
concerned.
and
the
lopez
case
supports
a
consensual
recording
and
i
see
really
no
difference
between
a
consensual
recording
and
a
consensual
radio
which
broadcasts
somebody
else
to
either
overhear
or
record.
so
in
summation
of
this
point,
we
say
there
was
no
violation
of
a
confidential
relationship
to
which
the
fourth
amendment
could
attach
and
there
was
no
violation
of
a
protected
place
to
which
a
fourth
amendment
could
attach
in
all
of
these
situations.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
well
it
was
--
the
circuit
court
reversed
on
the
katz
case.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
oh!
well,
that
point
is
there
and
we
urge
it
--
i
would
urge
the
court
not
to
decide
the
case
on
retroactivity.
the
importance
of
law
points.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
well,
they
contend
not.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
i
would
read
desist
as
cutting
off
everything
back
of
the
day
on
which
desist,
i
mean
on
which
katz
came
down.
katz,
in
effect
overruled
two
constitutional
decisions.
they
have
quite
an
argument
on
that
which
i
have
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
i
don't
know
which
way
you
take
the
points.
i
suppose,
you
could
decide
the
case
either
way
on
either
set
of
points.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
if
there
was
no
need
for
a
warrant,
you
don't
get
to
desist.
i
don't
know
it's
--
now
i
want
to
point
out
on
this
account
that
the
government
has
pending
here
some
22
cases,
pending
in
this
court
involving
this
type
of
point,
one
way
or
another,
this
overhearing
point,
and
very
close
to
the
--
in
one
way
or
another
very
close
to
the
point
being
argued
here
on
the
fourth
amendment.
and
due
to
the
points
of
law
enforcement
of
getting
this
decided,
we
are
not
--
while
we
urge
desist
point,
we
would
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
i
am
sorry,
no
i
am
not
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
no
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
what
we
have
is
somewhat
of
analysis
of
the
22
cases
here
and
with
the
court's
permission
i
can
make
an
analysis,
plenty
support
of
it.
on
that
i
don't
have
any
information.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
yes,
sir,
this
was
before
desist.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
no,
they
did
not.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
that's
right.
the
third
question
involved
is
that
the
informant
did
not
testify
at
the
trial.
this
was
raised
and
this
problem
was
discussed,
and
there
was
dissent
by
judge
warren
on
one
of
these
cases
and
has
been
brought
up
before.
but
our
position
on
that
is
the
question
of
the
tactics
of
the
trial
and
the
use
of
the
witnesses
is
not
a
constitutional
question,
that
the
necessity
of
obtaining
a
warrant
and
its
constitutionality
must
be
determined
at
the
time
of
the
search.
and
you
don't
know
then
whether
or
not
who
is
going
to
testify,
whether
there'd
be
any
trial
at
all.
and
so
we
say
that,
that
this
maybe
some
other
type
of
law
problem,
but
the
question
of
whether
the
witness
is
used
isn't
--
it
can't
be
a
factor
in
determining
constitutionality
of
the
search
and
the
necessity
for
a
warrant.
thanks.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
may
it
please
the
court,
just
a
few
points
in
rebuttal.
one,
counsel
referred
to
some
of
this
is
being
hearsay
and
i
think
that
that's
not
a
proper
classification.
any
direct
testimony
of
the
words
which
constitute
an
event
is
not
hearsay
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
hearsay
problem
in
this
case
at
all.
perhaps
the
most
difficult,
one
of
the
most
difficult
judicial
task
for
a
court
of
last
resort
is
the
balancing
of
values
which
necessarily
go
into
close
constitutional
decisions.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
is
the
balancing
of
values,
which
perhaps
in
interpreting
the
constitution.
in
that
regard,
i
want
to
point
out
that
radio
communication
is
increasingly
a
part
of
police
work
and
that's
particularly
true
in
these
narcotics
cases.
a
typical
narcotics
case
involves
undercover
agent
who
makes
contact
to
make
a
purchase,
he
goes
to
a
street
corner.
he
is
picked
in
a
car
by
someone
he
doesn't
know,
who
takes
him
around
the
city
and
they
drive
for
maybe
sometimes
several
hours
while
they
try
to
throw
off
a
tail.
they
then
go
to
an
apartment
he
didn't
know
about
and
there
he
meets
somebody
that
he
never
saw
before
and
negotiates
his
purchase
and
usually,
they
have
to
send
out
and
get
the
narcotics
and
bring
it
back.
and
a
proper
working
of
that
by
the
police
just
requires
a
radio
communication
that
takes
a
squad
from
four
to
seven
men
to
investigate
that
situation,
may
have
to
have
communication
coming
out
of
the
informant
who
is
negotiating
the
sale.
now
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor,
because
this
is
a
very
dangerous
business
and
especially
for
the
man
who
is
negotiating
the
purchase
and
they
need
that
to
ensure
his
safety.
in
addition,
our
help
and
should,
they
need
it
for,
to
permit
the
proper
timing
of
the
arrest
and
then
they
also
needed
for,
it's
very
valuable
in
following
a
car.
if
an
informant
has
a
radio
–
kel
radio
on
and
they
can
follow
the
car
at
a
much
greater
distance;
they
don't
have
to
get
so
close
to
it
in
order
to
do
the
tailing
and
it
protects
the
potential
defendant
against
the
informant.
in
this
type
of
police
work,
the
person,
who
negotiates
the
sale,
is
often
an
addict
himself
and
is
maybe
not
the
most
reliable
person
in
the
world.
and
one
of
the
things
that
the
responsible
officer
wants
to
know
is
exactly
what
is
happening
and
not
just
a
secondhand
version
of
it
from
an
informant
or
purchaser
who
may
not
be
too
reliable.
and
so
it
actually
operates
to
help
protect
the
defendant
himself
against
possible
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
well
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
the
explanation
in
the
record
is
that
they
looked
for
him
and
couldn't
find
him.
there
is
dispute
between
us
as
to
the
diligence
and
all
of
that
but
there
is
an
explanation
that
they
looked
for
him
and
couldn't
find
him
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
we
would
wind
up
our
presentation
here
by
urging
that
in
considering
of
this
situation
that
we
urge
upon
the
court
that
you
take
into
consideration
the
overall
demands
of
law
enforcement
in
this
situation
and
if
there
is
to
be
a
balancing
of
rights
here
as
between
the
person
under
surveillance
or
under
suspicion,
the
narcotics
trail
in
considering
his
rights
vis-à-vis
the
government,
in
making
that
case
to
also
balancing
against
that
the
effects
of
a
narcotic
trade
and
i
would
make
a
special
appeal
for
the
young
people
of
inner
cities
where
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
it
does
not,
your
honor,
except
that
you
get
to
this
problem
of
a
very
difficult
decision
of
a
closed
case.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
well,
that's
possible
too
and
i
was
thinking
in
terms
of
the
overall
affect
of
law
enforcement
in
the
narcotics
field
and
of
the
terrible
effect
upon
the
victims.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
we
respectfully
request
that
the
decision
be
reversed.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
fourth
amendment
criminal
case
involving
a
conviction
for
the
sale
of
heroin
reversed
by
the
circuit
court
on
the
katz
case.
this
was
a
narcotic
agent
wired
for
--
with
a
kel
radio
without
a
search
warrant.
it
involved
the
purchase,
delivery,
payment
and
the
sale
of
heroin.
the
informer
to
negotiate
the
parties
was
not
available
to
testify
so
the
case
was
proved
altogether
out
of
government
agents.
one
of
them
whom
hid
on
the
closet
and
others
heard
the
--
some
of
the
conversation
over
a
kel
radio.
in
all,
there
were
four
kitchen
meetings
in
the
home
of
the
informant
government
agent
type,
one
in
the
defendant’s
home,
two
in
the
informer’s
car
and
one
in
the
restaurant.
the
facts
are
that
on
december
9,
1965,
informant
harvey
jackson
met
in
his
own
kitchen
the
defendant
white.
at
that
time,
there
was
a
narcotics
agent
hiding
in
a
closet
where
he
could
see
in
here
the
events
in
the
kitchen
and
the
informant
had
on
him
a
kel
radio
which
is
a
short-range
radio
and
there
was
a
narcotics
agent
in
the
car,
a
short
distance
away
from
the
house
listening
to
the
conversation.
at
that
time,
there
was
a
delivery
of
one
ounce
of
heroin.
on
december
the
10th,
there
was
another
such
meeting
at
which
the
same
setup
with
the
--
at
which
time
the
informant
paid
a
thousand
dollars
and
agreed
to
purchase
some
additional
heroin
the
next
day.
on
december
the
14th,
the
informant
went
to
defendant
white’s
home
also
with
a
radio
on
him
and
went
in
and
paid
the
defendant
in
his
home
and
agreed
to
purchase
two
additional
ounces,
at
that
time
a
government
agent
was
outside
listening
to
the
conversation.
on
december
the
16th
of
1965
in
the
informant’s
car,
the
informant
and
the
defendant
drove
for
two
hours
with
the
informant
having
on
him
a
kel
radio
and
with
agents
of
the
narcotic
bureau
following
the
car
and
listening
to
the
conversation.
in
that
series
of
events
the
defendant
took
the
informant’s
car
and
let
the
informant
out,
and
met
another
man
named
sam
minerva
who
gave
him
heroin
and
then
he
picked
up
the
informant
again.
on
december
the
18th,
back
in
informant
jackson’s
kitchen,
at
his
home
with
jackson
and
white
at
the
table,
the
agent
in
the
closet,
the
agent
outside
listening
to
the
radio,
there
was
paid
$1,250.00
on
the
transaction
by
jackson
to
white.
on
december
the
29th
of
1965,
white
met
the
informant
jackson
agreed
to
meet
him
at
lake
and
royal
street
in
chicago
each
drove
his
own
car.
white
walked
up
to
jackson’s
car
and
delivered
the
heroin
with
jackson
being
having
on
his
radio
and
the
agent
is
listening
from
some
distance.
on
january
the
5th,
in
the
informant
jackson’s
kitchen
with
the
same
setup,
white
--
jackson
paid
white
$1,300.00.
on
the
january
the
8th,
at
a
restaurant
called
the
luminar
restaurant
which
the
defendant
have
some
connection
with,
they
met,
discussed,
again
with
the
radio
on
and
the
narcotic
agent
outside
the
restaurant
listening
to
the
camera
--
conversation
agreed
to
meet
at
leg
in
well
street
and
purchased
three
things
of
heroin
for
$2500.00.
on
january
the
9th,
white,
the
defendant
drove
up
and
stopped
and
stayed
in
randall
street
where
he
was
met
by
minerva
delivering
the
narcotic
and
at
that
time
the
agents
close-in
and
made
the
arrest
and
the
case
was
completed.
so
to
recap,
there
were
four
meetings
in
informant
kitchen.
one
meeting
in
defendant’s
home,
two
meetings
in
informant’s
car,
one
meeting
at
the
luminar
restaurant
and
addition
to
that,
an
overhearing
on
the
telephone,
the
very
offset
of
the
katz
case
where
the
informant
called
the
defendant
and
permitted
the
agents
to
listen
in
on
his
end
of
the
telephone
through
the
same
receiver.
so,
let’s
look
first
at
what
questions
are
not
involved
in
this.
we
do
not
have
any
questions
of
the
fifth
or
sixth
amendment
because
this
is
not
the
overhearing
of
conversations
about
past
events
in
the
nature
of
admission
or
a
confession.
this
is
an
overhearing
of
the
actual
transaction
itself
and
there
is
no
recitation
relied
on
and
put
in
the
evidence
or
involved
here
that
would
involve
either
the
fifth
amendment
or
sixth
amendment
questions
in
the
sense
of
either
testifying
against
himself
as
to
past
events
or
the
right
to
counsel.
and
that
we
think
is
fairly
clear
if
you
consider
the
situation
involving
the
normal
condition
of
bank
lobby
now
where
there
is
a
hidden
camera
and
frequently
hidden
radio
or
recording
devices,
and
a
bank
robber
comes
in
and
triggers
the
camera
and
the
camera
records
the
actual
crime
itself
and
the
recording
device
or
radio
records
the
words
used
by
the
bank
robber
in
committing
the
crime.
i
think
no
one
would
seriously
contend
that
there
was
any
constitutional
question
in
the
fourth,
fifth,
or
sixth
involved
in
that
situation.
here
the
radio
was
substantially
the
same
thing,
a
broadcast
of
the
crime
itself
being
committed.
the
--
white’s
conversation
and
the
words
used
give
him
an
evidence
were
all
a
part
of
the
contract
and
sale,
a
commercial
transaction,
a
contract
and
sale
of
heroin.
this
is
not
a
crime
of
violence
or
any
other
kind
of
crime
except
a
commercial
transaction
and
it
is
by
law
made
illegal.
so,
the
--
as
far
as
the
informant’s
kitchen
and
car
is
concerned,
there’s
no
trespass
because
they
belonged
to
the
informant
who
invited
the
defendant
white
to
come
there
and
make
the
sale.
and
the
restaurant
was
a
public
place
and
defendant’s
home
was
no
trespassed
because
the
defendant
invited
the
informant
to
come
to
his
home
to
take
--
to
make
payment
for
the
narcotic.
all
of
that
is
pretty
well
governed
by
the
lewis
case.
now
that
brings
us
to
katz
which
is
you
all
know
is
the
bugging
of
a
telephone
booth
situation.
and
its
discussions
of
the
expectation
of
privacy
which
is
probably
the
central
question
that
the
court
will
be
concerned
with
in
this
situation.
and
so
we
could
ask
ourselves
what
legal
expectations
of
privacy
did
the
lower
court
to
defendant
white
when
he
went
to
defendant’s
jackson
--
to
jackson’s
kitchen
to
sell
narcotics.
certainly,
the
law
does
not
protect
white
against
the
other
part
of
the
transaction
testified.
this
is
a
--
as
i
said
this
is
a
bargain
and
sale,
a
contract
made
partly
in
words,
partly
by
the
passage
of
money,
and
partly
by
the
passage
of
the
narcotics,
the
delivery
of
narcotic.
and
whether
civil
or
criminal
either
side
can
testify
as
to
a
contract,
and
either,
in
any
type
of
case.
so
when
the
parties
enter
into
a
commercial
transaction
that
is
by
law
made
criminal.
either
party
can
testify
so
white
had
no
expectation
of
privacy
that
the
other
side
of
his
contract
wouldn’t
and
couldn’t
testify
to
it
as
he
had
a
perfect
legal
right
to
do.
and
then
there
is
in
the
situation
language
which
comes
in
that
i
think
needs
to
be
clarified
somewhat
and
that
is
this
coming
from
some
of
the
older
cases.
the
question
of
misplaced
confidences
between
the
seller
of
narcotics
who
is
selling
to
a
government
agent.
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
this
was
arm’s
length
transaction.
this
isn’t
a
--
there
wasn’t
any
relationship
of
confidence
between
this
two
people.
it’s
not
husband
and
wife,
lawyer-client,
or
doctor-patient,
a
priest-penitent,
anything
like
that.
this
is
a
sale
between
strangers
and
an
arm’s
length
sale.
and
one
of
the
risks
that
a
man
in
the
illegal
business
of
selling
narcotics
takes
is
that
some
of
his
customers
will
turn
to
out
to
be
government
agents.
and
he
knows
that
when
he
goes
in
the
business.
he
runs
that
risk
and
so
there
isn’t
any
misplaced
confidence
in
this
situation.
and
certainly
the
law
does
not
protect
white
against
either
the
fact
that
may
turn
out
to
be
a
government
agent
and
that
he
may
testify.
and
there’s
no
breach
of
duty
on
the
part
of
the
informant
in
this
situation.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
no
sir,
he
didn’t.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
yes
sir,
i
do
mr.
justice.
in
this
that
it
gives
to
the
policy
of
the
question
raised
by
the
former
chief
justice
in
his
dissent
in
one
of
this
cases
and
that
is,
can
the
government
use
the
recorded
or
secondary
testimony
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
when
the
informant
doesn’t
testify?
in
this
case,
we
could
not
and
find
the
informant
at
that
time.
and
it
is
--
it
becomes
then
i
guess
a
policy
question
as
to
where
there
the
government
should
or
should
not
be
able
to
use
the
testimony
at
that
time.
but
it’s
not
a
constitutional
question
because
the
constitutional
rights
are
determined
as
of
the
time
of
the
search
and
not
by
the
development
of
the
case.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
mr.
justice,
we
all
have
to
make
a
statement
later
which
we
will
make.
i
understood
that
they
did
put
them
all
in
but
i’m
not
clear
on
that
so
we
we’ll
clear
that
up.
i
didn’t
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
well,
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
no
sir,
he
wouldn’t.
he
would
have
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
under
cross-examination
but
not
under
direct
examination.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
no
possibility
when
it’s
not
produced
that’s
correct.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
well,
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
he
was
a
--
he
was
acting
for
the
government
over
a
considerable
period
of
time
here.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
no,
sir.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
but
i
can
say,
we
might
he
might
well
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
yes,
sir.
but
you
see
that
would
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
that
would
go
to
the
court
--
that
would
go
to
the
credibility
of
his
testimony
and
we’re
not
--
since
we’re
not
offering
him
the
credibility
of
his
testimony
is
not
an
issue.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
no,
sir.
they
--
i’ve
read
the
record
and
it
was
no
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
no,
sir.
we
did
not
refuse
it.
now,
as
to
the
agent
hiding
in
the
closet
i
see
no
constitutional
question
on
that
at
all.
as
to
the
kel
radio
which
is
the
central
question
before
the
court
here.
there’s
nothing
sinister
about
a
radio.
it’s
--
the
radio
is
a
common
part
of
our
life
now
used
in
all
types
of
communication
as
good
law
enforcement
technique.
it
increased
the
accuracy
of
proving
the
case.
it
helps
detect
the
safety
of
the
agent.
now,
one
of
the
things
that
we’re
concerned
with
is
in
this
narcotic
purchases,
that’s
a
rather
dangerous
business
for
the
agent.
and
if
he
is
in
there
and
needs
help,
the
agent
listening
on
the
outside
can
determine
that
and
come
in
once
long
go
at
lost
made
under
those
circumstances.
it
makes
it
better
development
of
all
aspects
of
the
case.
frequently,
on
a
propose
purchase
of
narcotics
when
the
agent
goes
in
to
an
apart
where
there
something
it
turns
out
that
he
negotiates
with
them.
they
don’t
have
it.
they
said,
they
say
you
wait
here
and
will
send
forth.
they
send
forth
and
if
the
agents
on
the
outside
have
the
intelligence
that
conversation
they
can
follow
the
man
and
get
his
source
and
take
him
to
where
he
is
going
for
it.
if
they
don’t
have
that,
they
may
arrest
--
i
mean,
make
their
arrest
prematurely
there,
their
raids
prematurely
and
they
do
not
have
a
smooth
development
of
the
case
that
they
do
using
the
kel
radio.
and
as
especially
true
in
the
business
of
following
the
cars,
it’s
difficult
to
follow
a
car
in
traffic.
if
they
do
not
have
a
radio
communication
in
tailing
the
car,
they
have
to
be
closer
to
it.
if
they
got
a
radio
communication
with
an
informant
from
the
car,
they
can
drop
back
and
have
a
great
deal
more
success
in
following
the
car
at
a
distance.
it
protects
the
defendant
against
falls
testimony.
these
narcotic
agents
nature
things
they
are
usually
addicts,
they
are
not
perhaps
the
most
reliable
people
in
the
world
in
many
ways.
and
this
gives
the
bureau
of
narcotics
a
check
and
a
protection
on
the
agent
himself
of
framing
a
defendant
when
they
can
listen
to
the
conversation
and
hear
it
all.
now
taking
the
subject
of
these
consensual
overhearings
direct,
we
take
the
flat
position
that
a
consensual
overhearing
where
one
party
to
a
conversation
consents
does
not
involve
fourth
amendment
problems.
just
recently
in
the
case
of
frazier
versus
cupp
which
was
a
search
and
seizure
case
involving
a
duffel
bag
where
two,
i
believe
it
was
a
murder
case,
had
hidden
the
clothes
that
they
wore
at
the
time
crime
in
a
duffel
bag.
and
one
of
the
defendants
gave
permission
to
the
officers
to
search
the
duffel
bag
without
a
warrant.
it
was
held
that
that
was
illegal
search
and
so
having
one
of
the
parties
having
consent,
the
search
was
legal
as
to
both
of
them
and
the
close
could
be
used
in
evidence
against
the
non-consenting
party
in
that
type
of
search.
well,
the
same
thing
would
apply
to
both
ends
of
a
telephone
conversation
or
radio
conversation
and
having
to
see
no
difference
between
the
overheard
telephone
conversations
in
this
case
and
the
overheard
radio
conversations.
they
were,
if
they
are
legal
without
a
warrant
on
the
fourth
amendment,
it’s
because
of
the
consent
of
one
of
the
parties
of
the
conversation
and
it
seems
to
me
they
are
the
same
thing.
it’s
almost
the
exact
opposite
of
the
situation,
the
katz
case
where
the
listing
device
was
put
in
on
without
the
consent
of
either
party
and
on
the
end
of
the
person
who
was
under
trial.
of
course,
the
court’s
familiar
with
the
lopez
case
where
and
irs
agent
went
into
a
bribe
situation.
i
may
say
that
the
government
uses
this
kel
radios
in
two
main
situations.
in
the
main,
one
is
for
narcotics
cases
and
the
second
is
for
bribery
case.
and
bribery
is
one
of
the
central
problems
in
government
as
everybody
knows.
now,
in
the
lopez
case,
irs
agent
went
in
with
the
recoding
device
and
i
personally
see
no
difference
between
a
recording
device
and
a
kel
radio
which
puts
it
outside
for
notes
or
recording.
and
it
was
held
there
in
an
arm’s
length
transaction.
no
confidential
relationship
between
a
government
agent
for
the
irs
and
the
taxpayer
that
there
was
no
expectation
of
privacy
in
that
situation.
and
that
bring
us
to
on
lee,
perhaps
one
of
the
earliest
of
these
cases.
in
on
lee
of
course
has
been
greatly
criticized
and
it
is
vulnerable
criticism
on
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
and
that
is
the
obtaining
by
stealth
of
confession
or
admission
after
the
event
which
is
on
lee
as
the
court
remembers,
the
narcotic
agent
went
into
the
laundry
and
the
agent
stayed
outside
after
the
case
have
been
made
and
after
indictment
and
it
raises
both
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
problems.
it
was
upheld
on
the
fourth
and
my
feeling
is
that
it
was
correctly
upheld
on
the
fourth.
again,
a
consensual
hearing
is
not
a
search
and
seizure
situation.
the
defendant
has
raised
questions
about
whether
this
is
a
true
consensual
case
based
upon
the
proof
track
court
found
that
informant
jackson
did
consent
and
we
have
covered
that
as
a
factual
matter
in
extensive
supplemental
brief.
now
to
reiterate
the
point
raised
a
few
minutes
ago
about
the
informant
himself
not
testified.
our
position
is
that
that’s
not
a
constitutional
point.
it
might
go
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
it
might
go
to
some
search
problem
as
best
evidence
but
it
doesn’t
goes
the
constitutionality
of
the
search
because
that
must
be
determined
as
of
the
time
of
the
search
and
not
by
subsequent
technical
developments
in
the
trial
itself.
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
well,
we
have
desist
as
a
second
point
and
we
urge
that
--
but
we
are
very
hopeful
of
not
reaching
that
we
can
prevail
on
our
first
and
fourth
amendment
point.
but
we
think
that
this
case
if
you
passed
that.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
well,
that’s
right.
we
have
in
our
brief
though.
i
don’t
know
intensively.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
well,
we
feel
that
this
is
a
katz.
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
don’t
know
that
i
fully
understand
my
way
around
all
of
the
desist
law
but
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
that
is
when
the
court,
i
don’t
see
it’s
what
amounts
in
new
constitutional
law
in
the
sense
of
overruling
and
accepting
the
position.
that
as
far
as
the
officers
are
concerned,
it
would
be
applied
only
to
their
acts
after
they
have
full
knowledge
of
the
new
law
in
fact
and
that
being
true
we
see
that
we
think
that
it
should
apply
here
and
especially
the
fact
that
this
is
such
widespread
device
and
used
so
throughout
law
enforcement
and
it’s
been
done
in
the
belief
that
it
was
not
a
search
warrant
situation.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
that’s
correct
your
honor.
we
sincerely
hope
that
the
court
can
see
it’s
way
to
right
on
this
point
rather
than
to
this
point
if
possible
because
it’s
one
that’s
vital
to
the
daily
work
of
law
enforcement
agencies
and
the
desist
point
is
the
matter
of
salvaging
a
case.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
just
two
points
i
want
to
get
briefly.
one
of
them
is
on
the
part
judge,
mr.
justice
marshall
raised
on
the
production
of
the
witness
that
we
form
at
the
trial.
if
we
are
required
to
do
that
and
can
only
use
the
evidence
when
you
have
informant
there
that
puts
the
premium
on
having
their
life.
and
in
this
situation,
the
best
policy
would
be
not
to
fix
it
where
if
the
informant
is
gone
you
can’t
try
the
man,
in
my
judgment.
and
secondly,
that
it
doesn’t
go
to
the
constitutionality
the
search
in
the
first
place.
and
the
other
thing
on
the,
i’ll
address
myself
directly
to
the
question
of
getting
a
search
warrant
in
this
situation?
this
type
of
radio
communication
is
used
right
from
the
inception
of
the
case
before
you
have
a
probable
cause
frequently
and
if
you
have
to
get
a
warrant
before
you
use
it,
it
will
prevent
the
building
of
proper
cause
and
secondly,
in
a
rapidly
developing
narcotics
sale,
the
agent
frequently
does
not
know
either
the
place
or
the
people
he
is
going
to
be
negotiating
with.
he
goes
and
gets
to
meet
somebody
in
a
street
car
and
gets
in
the
car
and
they
take
him
of
clear-cross
town
to
an
apartment
or
something
else
and
there
the
sale
is
consummated.
so
that
if
we
have
to
designate
either
the
place
or
the
people
to
be
searched
while
it
will
make
it
a
very
difficult
situation
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
kel
is
a
little,
a
very
small
radio
that
would
broadcast
about
three
miles.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
yes,
sir,
i
don’t
there’s
any
chance
of
inserting
it
on
someone
without
their
knowledge.
as
i
understand
it,
it’s
hidden
usually
around
the
chest
somewhere
to
pick
up
the
language.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
i
think
it
stays
on
most
of
the
time
he
is
there.
but
i
don’t
know
whether
he’s
got
--
that
i’ll
find
that
out.
in
short,
we
will
urge
the
court
that
in
the
interest
if
in
balancing
the
value
share,
you
got
the
value
in
the
privacy
is
raised
in
all
of
its
opinions
as
against
the
question
of
law
enforcement,
the
security
of
the
citizen,
the
sale
of
narcotics
which
is
increasingly
difficult
problem.
we
ask
that
the
in
the
definition
of
privacy
under
fourth
amendment
not
be
extended
in
this
situation
and
that
that
the
law
officers
be
continued
to
use
this
kel
radios
in
a
skillful
development
of
these
cases
as
a
top
problem
in
law
enforcement.
and
so
we
would
urge
the
court
to
hold
that
this
is
not
a
fourth
amendment
search
requiring
a
warrant
in
probable
cause
and
that
also
if
the
court
reaches
the
point
that
we
not
be
required
to
produce
the
witness
before
we
can
produce
the
evidence
in
this
situation
that
is
the
informer.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
no,
sir.
not
at
all.
i
said
in
this
situation.
you
see
we
contend
that
katz
does
not
apply
with
the
situation.
these
are
--
these
consensual
hearings.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
well,
yes.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
i
don’t
know
it
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
[voice
overlap]
just
one
another
but
that’s
the
principal
place
they
applied
in
narcotics.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
well,
it
--
what
we
would
like
for
the
court
to
hold
is
that
where
there
is
a
conversation
that
is
the
commission
of
the
crime
itself
as
distinguished
from
confession
on
admission
of
past
events
and
that
where
one
of
the
parties
of
the
conversation
consents
to
an
overhearing
by
government
agent
that
that
is
not
a
situation
requiring
a
search
warrant
on
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
reargument,
our
second
argument
of
this
case,
therefore,
i
am
going
to
assume
that
the
court
is
somewhat
familiar
with
the
case
and
i
point
out
that
it
involves
a
criminal
conviction
for
the
sale
of
heroin.
the
principal
law
point
center
in
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
investigatory
process
which
was
an
overhearing
by
radio
without
warrant.
there
are
other
issues.
the
first
issue
that
the
defendant
stresses
is
whether
the
informant
who
made
the
purchase
gave
his
consent
to
being
equipped
or
wired
with
a
radio
for
the
purpose
of
transmitting
the
interview.
the
second
issue
is
whether
there
were,
in
this
investigatory
process
a
search
and
seizure
which
required
a
warrant
where
no
warrant
was
issued,
therefore
go
to
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence
obtained.
the
third
issue
concerns
the
trial
procedure
where
the
informant
or
purchaser
did
not
himself
testify
and
the
case
was
made
exclusively
from
the
testimony
of
the
investigatory
agents
who
observed
the
transaction.
the
fourth
issue
is
the
retroactivity
of
the
katz
case
under
desist.
now
to
speak
briefly
to
the
consent
of
the
informant
or
the
purchaser
or
the
agent,
the
government's
position
is
that
the
whole
course
of
conduct
establishes
an
overwhelming
basis
for
the
consent
of
the
informant
to
have
a
radio
placed
on
him
and
to
go
through
with
the
transaction.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
it
was
called
the
kel
radio.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
transmitter
and
it's
put
on
the
chest
under
the
clothing
so
as
to
record
--
i
mean
to
pick
up
a
conversation.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
yes,
in
this
situation
most
of
the
interviews
have
occurred
in
the
home
of
the
agent
and
the
informant
and
the
two
of
the
government
agents
were
stationed
across
the
street,
it
will
transmit
for
a
mile
or
so.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
i
believe
it
was
the
car
or
another,
it
was
something
--
it
was
across
the
street
from
where
the
thing
occurred.
now
going
to
the
consent
of
the
informant
who
--
part
of
the
procedure,
he
met
the
agents
at
one
place
where
they
searched
him
to
determine
that
he
was
not
--
he
had
no
narcotics
and
all
of
these
informants
are
themselves
addicts
that
are
used
by
the
investigatory
body
to
make
the
purchase.
the
search
team
for
narcotics
found
that
he
had
not
on
him,
put
the
radio
on
him,
gave
him
money
and
then
went
with
him
to
his
home
where
one
of
the
informants
hid
in
a
closet
in
the
kitchen
of
the
--
i
mean,
one
of
the
government
agents
hid
in
a
closet
of
the
kitchen
and
the
other
two
were
across
the
street.
there
were
four
such
meetings
over
a
period
of
roughly
30
days
in
addition
to
a
telephone
conversation
that
was
overheard,
and
two
conversations
on
the
car
and
one
in
a
restaurant;
some
8
or
9
transactions
over
a
period
of
30
days
and
our
position
is
that
any
objective
viewing
of
this
course
of
conduct
would
establish
without
question
that
the
informant
did
consent
to
the
procedure
and
did
cooperate
with
it
in
the
sense
that
consent
is
an
element
in
a
consensual
overhearing.
the
informant's
name
was
harvey
jackson.
he
called
him
on
the
telephone.
in
addition
to
that
he
took
delivery
of
several
--
deliveries
of
heroin
which
he
in
turn,
turned
over
to
the
government
agents
and
he
accepted
from
the
government
agents
$1,000,
$1,350
and
$1,300
which
he
in
turn
paid
over
at
one
time
or
another
for
the
purchase
of
narcotics.
we
say
that
this
whole
course
of
conduct
establishes
that
the
informant,
harvey
jackson,
did
consent
in
the
sense
that
is
of
material
to
the
fourth
amendment
issue.
the
defendant
himself
in
his
arguments,
attacks
or
raises
questions
about
the
motivation
of
the
informant
for
consenting
and
we
say
that,
that's
wholly
immaterial
as
to
why
he
did
it,
but
now
getting
to
the
analysis
of
the
facts,
the
law
point
centered
around
the
fourth,
fifth,
and
sixth
amendment
questions,
and
i
want
to
give
you
--
take
the
set
of
facts,
typical
set
of
facts
and
go
through
them
and
analyzing
against
the
contentions
of
those
amendments.
harvey
jackson
met
three
government
agents
at
57th
and
outer
drive,
where
the
searched
him,
installed
a
radio,
gave
him
the
money
and
the
group
together
went
to
harvey
jackson's
home.
one
of
the
government
agents,
hid
in
a
closet
with
the
door
cracked
open
where
he
could
see
and
hear
the
transaction
that
was
about
to
take
place.
two
of
them
went
across
the
street.
the
defendant
white
came
in
the
back
door,
came
into
the
kitchen
of
the
government
informant.
they
sat
down
together.
there
was
a
commercial
transaction,
that
is,
an
offer
and
acceptance,
a
delivery
of
the
merchandise,
and
a
payment
for
it.
then
white,
the
defendant
got
up
and
left
and
after
that
jackson
turned
the
narcotics
over
to
the
government
agent
who
was
in
the
closet.
now
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
problem
in
this,
because
this
was
the
event,
this
was
the
crime
itself
and
there
is
no
confession
or
admission
involved
--
there
is
nothing
that
came
from
the
lips
of
the
defendant
referring
to
past
events.
so
there
can't
be
a
question
of
him
testifying
against
himself
in
this
question,
because
none
of
the
proof
involved
the
introduction
of
any
statements
by
the
defendant
with
reference
to
a
past
event.
all
of
them
are
to
a
current
event
which
is
a
commercial
transaction
of
the
crime
itself.
there
is
no
sixth
amendment
question
involved
in
this
because
he
was
not
under
arrest,
at
anytime
any
of
the
statements
were
made.
there
was
nothing
he
said
after
arrest
that
was
introduced
in
evidence
and
so
there
is
no
question
about
him
being
entitled
to
counsel
or
to
be
furnished
counsel
or
anything
like
that.
so
the
only
constitutional
question
as
i
see
it
that
could
be
involved
are
the
questions
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
thus
was
this
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
without
a
warrant?
now
first
taking
the
factual
situation,
the
narcotics
themselves,
the
existence
of
the
narcotics,
white
sold
the
narcotics
to
jackson,
the
government's
man
and
voluntarily
delivered
it
to
the
government
agent
in
his
own
kitchen,
generally,
or
in
his
own
automobile
in
other
situation.
after
white
parted
with
both
the
title
and
possessions
of
the
narcotics,
he
had
no
legal
rights
in
those
narcotics
at
all,
even
as
an
illegal
transaction.
jackson
could
do
anything
he
wanted
to
with
those
narcotics.
he
could
flush
them
down
the
toilet,
throw
them
out
of
the
window
or
give
them
to
a
government
agent
and
it
was
none
of
white's
business
what
jackson
did
with
those
narcotics.
so,
there
was
no
seizure
of
the
narcotics.
they
were
voluntarily
delivered
to
the
government
by
the
man
who'd
bought
them,
and
i
don't
see
that
there
could
be
any
question
about
there
being,
needed
a
warrant
to
get
the
possession
of
the
narcotics
come
out
of
the
situation.
now
let's
pass
to
the
agent
in
the
closet.
his
testimony
was
verbal.
he
was
put
on
by
direct
examination,
by
cross
examination.
when
defendant
white
went
to
another
man's
house
for
a
commercial
transaction,
he
had
no
legal
right
to
say
who
was
present
or
not
present.
the
man
who
owned
the
house
had
the
right
to
say
that.
and
so
consequently,
he
had
no
legal
right
to
an
expectation
of
privacy
that
there
wouldn't
be
anybody
else
in
his
customer's
house.
the
customer
had
a
right
to
bring
anybody
he
wanted
to
in
his
house,
and
he
had
a
right
to
hide
him
in
the
closet
if
he
wanted
to.
there
are
many
cases
that
hold
that.
to
hold
it
otherwise
would
be
to
make
the
event
itself
unprovable
with
direct
evidence.
and
there
wasn't
any
difference
between
a
witness
sitting
in
a
closet
who
eyeballs
this
transaction
and
sees
and
hears
the
transaction,
and
then
testifies
to
it
later,
then
a
witness
standing
on
the
corner,
who
sees
it
next
to
him
and
testifies
about
it
and
that's
not
a
search
and
seizure
problem.
and
so
there
is
no
question
of
there
being
any
necessity
for
a
warrant
to
introduce
the
testimony
of
the
eyeball
witness
to
the
transaction.
now,
let's
pass
to
the
agents
across
the
street
which
is
really
the
arguable
situation
here,
that
were
listening
in
on
the
radio
by
the
consent
and
invitation
of
harvey
jackson.
now
this
is
not
an
on
lee
situation
where
the
government
used
an
old
friend
after
indictment
of
the
defendant
to
extract
an
admission
or
confession
of
a
past
event
with
the
agents
listening
in
by
radio.
that's
not
this
situation.
here
the
agents
were
listening
to
event
itself
happen,
to
the
crime
being
committed
in
the
consummation
of
a
commercial
transaction
as
barred
below.
the
commission
of
the
crime
itself
is
not
protected
against
direct
proof
by
any
legal
expectation
of
privacy
and
i
think
that's
a
fundamental
statement.
you
cannot
go
into
the
commission
of
a
crime
with
the
expectation
of
privacy
that
you
won't
be
observed
or
the
proof
won't
be
offered.
consider
a
bank
robbery
situation,
where
the
bank
lobby
is
rigged
with
the
secret
camera
and
secret
radio
and
secret
recorder
to
obtain
good
proof
of
the
happening
of
the
bank
robbery.
does
this
require
a
search
warrant,
obviously
not.
it
would
be
wholly
impractical
to
require
the
bank
to
get
a
search
warrant
each
day
of
its
operation
and
there
they
might
have
a
robbery
that
day
and
there
would
be
no
proper
cause
and
lots
of
other
things.
but
the
use
of
electronics
to
record
the
happening
of
the
crime
in
a
bank
robbery
is
not
a
search
and
seizure
situation
requiring
a
warrant.
does
the
bank
robber
have
any
legal
expectation
of
privacy
which
shields
him
from
proof
of
the
event
itself,
by
any
direct
evidence,
either
electronically
recorded
or
otherwise,
obviously
not.
does
a
narcotic
peddler,
in
making
his
sale,
delivery
and
collection
of
money,
have
any
greater
legal
right
to
an
expectation
of
privacy
than
the
bank
robbery,
obviously
not,
he
should
not.
the
gathering
of
the
evidence
of
the
event
itself
with
either
camera
or
radio
or
any
other
electronic
device
should
not
require
a
warrant
in
either
situation.
the
fourth
amendment
protects
certain
places
and
certain
relations
and
certain
people.
let's
look
at
the
relationship
between
harvey
jackson
and
defendant
white.
it
was
that
of
a
buyer
and
seller
at
a
commercial
transaction.
it
was
not
a
confidential
relationship.
it
was
not
an
old
friend
as
in
the
chana
(ph)
case,
was
not
a
lawyer-client,
not
a
doctor-patient,
not
a
priest-penitent,
not
a
husband-wife,
it
was
not
a
relationship
that
would
be
protected
in
the
sense
of
a
right
of
expectation
of
privacy
out
of
the
relationship,
so
that
leaving
aside
the
place
altogether,
the
fourth
amendment
wouldn't
attach
to
that
relationship
of
a
commercial
transaction
which
is
it
by
law
illegal.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
as
i
remember,
he
went
into
public
phone-booth
and
he
shut
the
door.
now,
i
feel
like
that
the
katz
case
is
not
in
point
here
for
the
reason
that
when
he
went
in
that
phone-booth
and
paid
his
money
for
the
phone
call
and
shut
the
door,
he
had
a
right
of
expectation
of
privacy.
now
that's
not
our
situation
in
this
case.
in
the
katz
case
had
he,
for
instance,
not
gone,
had
it
been
one
of
these
phones
just
out
in
the
open
and
he
got
to
the
phone
out
in
the
open
and
made
his
call
and
bid
an
fbi
agent
stand
beside
him,
he
wouldn't
have
been
protected
against
the
privacy
of
that
because
he
didn't
expect
to
get
any
privacy.
he
expected
to
get
his
privacy
from
the
privacy
of
that
phone-booth.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
yes
sir,
that's
it.
i
will
come
to
the
telephone
in
a
minute
which
is
the
most
difficult
problem
of
our
brief
here.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
no,
sir.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
and
he
had,
he
took
the
man
with
him
in
the
phone-booth
and
man
did
not
electronically
listened
in.
he
simply
held
his
ear
up
near
the
receiver,
while
katz
was
–
while
the
informer
was
talking
to
the
defendant.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
he
did
not.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
the
katz
–
the
essential
difference
is
katz
is
not
really
a
consensual
case,
there
wasn't
any
consent
though
there
at
all
and
this
is
a
consensual
case
and
the
real
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
that's
--
and
that's
true
in
our
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
that's
right,
that's
right.
perhaps
my
statement
was
little
too
broad
on
that.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
yes
sir
and
the
man
who
was
overheard,
was
in
a
place
where
he
had
a
right
of
expectation
of
privacy
under
the
katz
decision.
our
statement
about
electronic
was
a
little
too
broad
on
that
scope.
now
let's
come
to
the
telephone
conversation,
where
the
court
will
recall,
jackson,
the
government
informant
went
to
the
telephone
and
called
the
defendant
white
for
the
purpose
of
making
his
date
to
pay
some
money.
and
he
took
with
him
a
government
agent
who
went
into
the
phone-booth
with
him
and
listened
by
holding
his
ear
up
close
to
the
telephone
and
he
listened
to
jackson
to
the
end
of
the
conversation
with
the
consent
of
jackson.
now
that
gets
closer
to
the
fourth
amendment
problem
in
my
judgment
than
anything
else
in
the
case,
at
this
juncture.
but
again,
it's
a
consent
case
and
you
should
take
the
rathbun
case
which
you
remember
is
the
telephone
extension
case,
where
the
man
was
listening
on
an
extension
of
the
telephone,
instead
of
listening
to
the
very
telephone
itself.
it
was
held
that,
that
was
not
a
warrant
situation.
and
we
see
really
little
difference
in
this
case
and
the
rathbun
case.
again,
i
point
out
that
what
the
agent
listened
to
was
not
an
admission
or
confession
and
so
there
is
no
fifth
or
sixth
amendment
and
only
a
fourth
amendment
problem
in
there.
it
was
not
a
wire
tap
and
it
was
not
an
uninvited
ear
because
he
was
invited
by
one
party
to
the
conversation.
and
we
see
really
no
difference
between
when
you
get
to
looking
at
it,
between
that
instant
in
the
telephone
booth
and
the
instant
of
the
radio.
now
there
was
a
car,
i
believe
were
two
cars
and
i
think
they
are
substantially
the
same
situation
as
the
others.
the
next
is
defendant
white's
home,
which
--
where
the
agent
went
by
himself,
but
equipped
with
the
radio
where
government
officers
could
listen
to
the
conversation
in
defendant
white's
home,
but
again
we
say
that
the
lewis
case,
squarely
holds
that
there
is
no
invasion
of
the
privacy
of
the
home
when
defendant
converts
his
home
to
a
commercial
use
by
selling
narcotics,
that's
the
square
holding
of
the
lewis
case
and
secondly,
you
have
got
the
consent
element
as
far
as
electronics
are
concerned.
and
the
lopez
case
supports
a
consensual
recording
and
i
see
really
no
difference
between
a
consensual
recording
and
a
consensual
radio
which
broadcasts
somebody
else
to
either
overhear
or
record.
so
in
summation
of
this
point,
we
say
there
was
no
violation
of
a
confidential
relationship
to
which
the
fourth
amendment
could
attach
and
there
was
no
violation
of
a
protected
place
to
which
a
fourth
amendment
could
attach
in
all
of
these
situations.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
well
it
was
--
the
circuit
court
reversed
on
the
katz
case.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
oh!
well,
that
point
is
there
and
we
urge
it
--
i
would
urge
the
court
not
to
decide
the
case
on
retroactivity.
the
importance
of
law
points.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
well,
they
contend
not.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
i
would
read
desist
as
cutting
off
everything
back
of
the
day
on
which
desist,
i
mean
on
which
katz
came
down.
katz,
in
effect
overruled
two
constitutional
decisions.
they
have
quite
an
argument
on
that
which
i
have
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
i
don't
know
which
way
you
take
the
points.
i
suppose,
you
could
decide
the
case
either
way
on
either
set
of
points.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
if
there
was
no
need
for
a
warrant,
you
don't
get
to
desist.
i
don't
know
it's
--
now
i
want
to
point
out
on
this
account
that
the
government
has
pending
here
some
22
cases,
pending
in
this
court
involving
this
type
of
point,
one
way
or
another,
this
overhearing
point,
and
very
close
to
the
--
in
one
way
or
another
very
close
to
the
point
being
argued
here
on
the
fourth
amendment.
and
due
to
the
points
of
law
enforcement
of
getting
this
decided,
we
are
not
--
while
we
urge
desist
point,
we
would
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
i
am
sorry,
no
i
am
not
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
no
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
what
we
have
is
somewhat
of
analysis
of
the
22
cases
here
and
with
the
court's
permission
i
can
make
an
analysis,
plenty
support
of
it.
on
that
i
don't
have
any
information.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
yes,
sir,
this
was
before
desist.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
no,
they
did
not.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
that's
right.
the
third
question
involved
is
that
the
informant
did
not
testify
at
the
trial.
this
was
raised
and
this
problem
was
discussed,
and
there
was
dissent
by
judge
warren
on
one
of
these
cases
and
has
been
brought
up
before.
but
our
position
on
that
is
the
question
of
the
tactics
of
the
trial
and
the
use
of
the
witnesses
is
not
a
constitutional
question,
that
the
necessity
of
obtaining
a
warrant
and
its
constitutionality
must
be
determined
at
the
time
of
the
search.
and
you
don't
know
then
whether
or
not
who
is
going
to
testify,
whether
there'd
be
any
trial
at
all.
and
so
we
say
that,
that
this
maybe
some
other
type
of
law
problem,
but
the
question
of
whether
the
witness
is
used
isn't
--
it
can't
be
a
factor
in
determining
constitutionality
of
the
search
and
the
necessity
for
a
warrant.
thanks.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
may
it
please
the
court,
just
a
few
points
in
rebuttal.
one,
counsel
referred
to
some
of
this
is
being
hearsay
and
i
think
that
that's
not
a
proper
classification.
any
direct
testimony
of
the
words
which
constitute
an
event
is
not
hearsay
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
hearsay
problem
in
this
case
at
all.
perhaps
the
most
difficult,
one
of
the
most
difficult
judicial
task
for
a
court
of
last
resort
is
the
balancing
of
values
which
necessarily
go
into
close
constitutional
decisions.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
is
the
balancing
of
values,
which
perhaps
in
interpreting
the
constitution.
in
that
regard,
i
want
to
point
out
that
radio
communication
is
increasingly
a
part
of
police
work
and
that's
particularly
true
in
these
narcotics
cases.
a
typical
narcotics
case
involves
undercover
agent
who
makes
contact
to
make
a
purchase,
he
goes
to
a
street
corner.
he
is
picked
in
a
car
by
someone
he
doesn't
know,
who
takes
him
around
the
city
and
they
drive
for
maybe
sometimes
several
hours
while
they
try
to
throw
off
a
tail.
they
then
go
to
an
apartment
he
didn't
know
about
and
there
he
meets
somebody
that
he
never
saw
before
and
negotiates
his
purchase
and
usually,
they
have
to
send
out
and
get
the
narcotics
and
bring
it
back.
and
a
proper
working
of
that
by
the
police
just
requires
a
radio
communication
that
takes
a
squad
from
four
to
seven
men
to
investigate
that
situation,
may
have
to
have
communication
coming
out
of
the
informant
who
is
negotiating
the
sale.
now
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor,
because
this
is
a
very
dangerous
business
and
especially
for
the
man
who
is
negotiating
the
purchase
and
they
need
that
to
ensure
his
safety.
in
addition,
our
help
and
should,
they
need
it
for,
to
permit
the
proper
timing
of
the
arrest
and
then
they
also
needed
for,
it's
very
valuable
in
following
a
car.
if
an
informant
has
a
radio
–
kel
radio
on
and
they
can
follow
the
car
at
a
much
greater
distance;
they
don't
have
to
get
so
close
to
it
in
order
to
do
the
tailing
and
it
protects
the
potential
defendant
against
the
informant.
in
this
type
of
police
work,
the
person,
who
negotiates
the
sale,
is
often
an
addict
himself
and
is
maybe
not
the
most
reliable
person
in
the
world.
and
one
of
the
things
that
the
responsible
officer
wants
to
know
is
exactly
what
is
happening
and
not
just
a
secondhand
version
of
it
from
an
informant
or
purchaser
who
may
not
be
too
reliable.
and
so
it
actually
operates
to
help
protect
the
defendant
himself
against
possible
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
well
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
the
explanation
in
the
record
is
that
they
looked
for
him
and
couldn't
find
him.
there
is
dispute
between
us
as
to
the
diligence
and
all
of
that
but
there
is
an
explanation
that
they
looked
for
him
and
couldn't
find
him
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
we
would
wind
up
our
presentation
here
by
urging
that
in
considering
of
this
situation
that
we
urge
upon
the
court
that
you
take
into
consideration
the
overall
demands
of
law
enforcement
in
this
situation
and
if
there
is
to
be
a
balancing
of
rights
here
as
between
the
person
under
surveillance
or
under
suspicion,
the
narcotics
trail
in
considering
his
rights
vis-à-vis
the
government,
in
making
that
case
to
also
balancing
against
that
the
effects
of
a
narcotic
trade
and
i
would
make
a
special
appeal
for
the
young
people
of
inner
cities
where
--
mr.
will
r.
wilson
it
does
not,
your
honor,
except
that
you
get
to
this
problem
of
a
very
difficult
decision
of
a
closed
case.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
well,
that's
possible
too
and
i
was
thinking
in
terms
of
the
overall
affect
of
law
enforcement
in
the
narcotics
field
and
of
the
terrible
effect
upon
the
victims.
mr.
will
r.
wilson
we
respectfully
request
that
the
decision
be
reversed.
