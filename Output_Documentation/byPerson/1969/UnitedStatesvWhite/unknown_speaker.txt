unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
what
he
was
paid?
unknown
speaker
he
didn’t
deserve
or
he
didn’t
require
to
do
produce
the
conversations,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
if
you
put
it
less
than
all
of
the
record
and
the
records
had
and
the
recording
was
asked
--
the
rest
of
the
record
was
asked
for,
you
didn’t
refuse
it?
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you
a
question
general?
unknown
speaker
what
impact
do
you
think
destroys
the
decision
in
desist
case?
unknown
speaker
well
if
it
is,
we
don’t
have
to
reach
the
fourth
amendment
choice.
unknown
speaker
we
heard
that
you
got
all
the
comment.
is
this
same
in
katz
about
the
interactive?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
go
from
there?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it’s
a
considerably
more
significance
to
your
department
as
law
enforcement
department
to
know
now
what
whatever
happened
in
this
case
violated
the
constitution?
rather
than
simply
to
get
this
judgment
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
the
non-retroactivity
of
katz?
unknown
speaker
that’s
right.
unknown
speaker
we’re
talking
about
two
rather
different
things
aren’t
we?
the
bumper
case
involve
the
person
whose
alleged
fourth
amendment
rights
were
violated,
this
where
a
constant
to
an
entry
in
the
search
is
a
very,
very
critical
issue
and
one
that
was
involved
is
said
in
that
case.
this
one
involves
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
person
was
or
was
not
a
government
agent,
doesn’t
it,
a
voluntary
government
agent?
there’s
no
question
here
of
--
no
questions
raised
here
about
the
violation
of
this
absent
witnesses
fourth
amendment
rights.
unknown
speaker
here’s
whether
or
not
he
was
a
voluntary
agent
of
the
government.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
the
mother
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
remember
the
facts
quite
clearly.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
your
argument
on
voluntariness
would
also
go
just
in
the
event
the
government
just
paid
the
informant.
no
question
particularly
but
there’s
a
promise
of
benefit
or
gain.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
in
a
guilty
plea,
rules
are
not
only
coercion
but
promise
of
benefit
or
game?
that
destroys
the
voluntariness
and
plea
doesn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
ordinarily
in
a
criminal
case,
if
you
are
examining
a
plea
bargain
for
example
and
if
there’s
some
promise
of
benefit.
doesn’t
that
have
a
lot
to
do
with
the
voluntariness
of
the
plea?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
informant.
if
the
government
pays
him
enough,
he’ll
do
anything?
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
if
that
was
there
evidence
in
any
way,
they
probably
won’t
get
a
conviction?
unknown
speaker
well,
here
they
have
evidence
and
they
did
use
it.
unknown
speaker
it
is
whether
or
not
it
was
--
unknown
speaker
--
constitutionally
valid
use?
unknown
speaker
tell
me
mr.
boeger,
if
this
informant
had
appeared,
had
been
cross-examined,
would
you
concede
then
that
this
evidence
was
properly
admitted?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
mean?
katz
means
there
has
to
be
judicial
authorization
in
this
situation?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
katz
overrule
lopez
and
on
lee?
that’s
what
you’re
saying
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
what
is
that
katty?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you’re
right
that
katz
covered
desist
situation,
what
about
desist?
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
date
of
all
these
events?
unknown
speaker
no,
the
events
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
does
desist
say
that
katz
is
an
applicable
to
anything
prior
to
that
decision?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
let’s
assume
that
katz
is
--
you
can’t
rely
on
katz
for
one
reason.
how
do
you
distinguish
this
case
with
on
lee?
unknown
speaker
this
is
with
what,
with
whom,
and
for
what?
unknown
speaker
but
somehow
your
man,
your
informant,
if
this
--
if
the
man
who
came
into
result
was
the
agent
and
the
bug
planted
on
him?
he
didn’t
know
he
had
it
at
all.
is
right
a
privacy
as
being
a
faithful
general?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
you’re
arguing?
unknown
speaker
and
that
--
unknown
speaker
and
that’s
something
that
your
defendant
--
your
client
can
take
advantage
of
it
really?
unknown
speaker
of
whom?
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
of
the
body
of
the
agent?
whose
privacy
is
being
bothered?
unknown
speaker
by
reason
of
what?
unknown
speaker
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
as
to
whoever
the
agent
who
had
the
bug
on
it
knew
who
is
coerced
and
having
it
around,
knew
that
he
had
it
on
that’s
wholly
irrelevant.
unknown
speaker
your
point
mr.
boeger,
is
that
if
the,
in
this
hypothetical
case,
the
man
is
an
agent
only
by
reason
that
he
is
the
unknown
carrier
of
a
microphone
surreptitiously
put
there
by
other
the
government
agent
that
that’s
the
equivalent
of
--
unknown
speaker
just
projecting
a
microphone
or
bug
inside
that
room,
without
the
knowledge
of
anybody.
but
that
you
don’t
--
as
i
understand
it,
you
don’t
go
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
this
case
is
that
kind
of
a
case
when
the
record
shows
here
that
this
man
voluntarily,
knowingly,
had
a
microphone
on
him
over
a
period
of
several
days.
your
question
only
is
whether
or
not
it
was
or
perhaps
i
was
wrong
in
using
voluntarily
and
attributing
it
to
you
but
at
least
knowingly?
unknown
speaker
so
it’s
not
the
hypothetical
case
that
we
were
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
no
investigative
functions
are
denied?
and
it
seems
you
have
to
have
problem
upon
--
unknown
speaker
but
how
can
they?
not
without
a
warrant
if
you
want
to
use
an
undercover
agent.
unknown
speaker
somewhere
along
the
line,
i
hear
that
--
that’s
when
it
listens
over
the
radio,
would
they?
unknown
speaker
general
wilson,
what
is
the
---
what
are
the
characteristics
of
a
kel
radio,
k-e-l
radio,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
and
is
it
accurate
to
say
or
to
surmise
that
it
could
be
used
only
in
connection
with
the
knowing
informer?
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
does
he
turn
it
turn
on
and
off
or
not?
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
what
he
was
paid?
unknown
speaker
he
didn’t
deserve
or
he
didn’t
require
to
do
produce
the
conversations,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
if
you
put
it
less
than
all
of
the
record
and
the
records
had
and
the
recording
was
asked
--
the
rest
of
the
record
was
asked
for,
you
didn’t
refuse
it?
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you
a
question
general?
unknown
speaker
what
impact
do
you
think
destroys
the
decision
in
desist
case?
unknown
speaker
well
if
it
is,
we
don’t
have
to
reach
the
fourth
amendment
choice.
unknown
speaker
we
heard
that
you
got
all
the
comment.
is
this
same
in
katz
about
the
interactive?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
go
from
there?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it’s
a
considerably
more
significance
to
your
department
as
law
enforcement
department
to
know
now
what
whatever
happened
in
this
case
violated
the
constitution?
rather
than
simply
to
get
this
judgment
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
the
non-retroactivity
of
katz?
unknown
speaker
that’s
right.
unknown
speaker
we’re
talking
about
two
rather
different
things
aren’t
we?
the
bumper
case
involve
the
person
whose
alleged
fourth
amendment
rights
were
violated,
this
where
a
constant
to
an
entry
in
the
search
is
a
very,
very
critical
issue
and
one
that
was
involved
is
said
in
that
case.
this
one
involves
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
person
was
or
was
not
a
government
agent,
doesn’t
it,
a
voluntary
government
agent?
there’s
no
question
here
of
--
no
questions
raised
here
about
the
violation
of
this
absent
witnesses
fourth
amendment
rights.
unknown
speaker
here’s
whether
or
not
he
was
a
voluntary
agent
of
the
government.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
the
mother
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
remember
the
facts
quite
clearly.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
your
argument
on
voluntariness
would
also
go
just
in
the
event
the
government
just
paid
the
informant.
no
question
particularly
but
there’s
a
promise
of
benefit
or
gain.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
in
a
guilty
plea,
rules
are
not
only
coercion
but
promise
of
benefit
or
game?
that
destroys
the
voluntariness
and
plea
doesn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
ordinarily
in
a
criminal
case,
if
you
are
examining
a
plea
bargain
for
example
and
if
there’s
some
promise
of
benefit.
doesn’t
that
have
a
lot
to
do
with
the
voluntariness
of
the
plea?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
informant.
if
the
government
pays
him
enough,
he’ll
do
anything?
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
if
that
was
there
evidence
in
any
way,
they
probably
won’t
get
a
conviction?
unknown
speaker
well,
here
they
have
evidence
and
they
did
use
it.
unknown
speaker
it
is
whether
or
not
it
was
--
unknown
speaker
--
constitutionally
valid
use?
unknown
speaker
tell
me
mr.
boeger,
if
this
informant
had
appeared,
had
been
cross-examined,
would
you
concede
then
that
this
evidence
was
properly
admitted?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
mean?
katz
means
there
has
to
be
judicial
authorization
in
this
situation?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
katz
overrule
lopez
and
on
lee?
that’s
what
you’re
saying
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
what
is
that
katty?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you’re
right
that
katz
covered
desist
situation,
what
about
desist?
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
date
of
all
these
events?
unknown
speaker
no,
the
events
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
does
desist
say
that
katz
is
an
applicable
to
anything
prior
to
that
decision?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
let’s
assume
that
katz
is
--
you
can’t
rely
on
katz
for
one
reason.
how
do
you
distinguish
this
case
with
on
lee?
unknown
speaker
this
is
with
what,
with
whom,
and
for
what?
unknown
speaker
but
somehow
your
man,
your
informant,
if
this
--
if
the
man
who
came
into
result
was
the
agent
and
the
bug
planted
on
him?
he
didn’t
know

is

of

whose

is
being
bothered?
unknown
speaker
by
reason
of
what?
unknown
speaker
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
as
to
whoever
the
agent
who
had
the
bug
on
it
knew
who
is
coerced
and
having

that’s
wholly
