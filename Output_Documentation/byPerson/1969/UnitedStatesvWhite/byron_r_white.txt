justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
the
katz
case,
the
defendant
didn't
take
anybody
in
the
phone-booth
with
him,
did
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
here
he
took
--
he
always
had
somebody
around?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
the
defendant
there
in
katz
didn't
know
anybody
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
take
somebody
to
the
phone-booth
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
all
this
relevant
at
all
--
why
is
the
katz
case
irrelevant?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
how
about
it's
retroactivity?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we've
already
decide
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
read
desist?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
in
order
to
get
to
the
katz's
point,
we
have
to
overrule
the
desist,
don't
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
don't
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
all
pre
katz's
case,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
hos
do
they
--
and
were
any
of
them
decided
after
desist
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
the
court
of
appeals
have
decided
that
katz
is
retroactive?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
--
would
you
suppose
that
the
informer
himself
who
was
been
invited
into
the
defendant's
home
and
said
something
to
him
and
records
it
on
the
informer's
brain
and
may
be
informer
testify
and
there
is
no
electronics
involved?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
your
principle
really
reach
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn’t
that
really
the
heart
of
the
matter
whether
the
government
may
use
an
informer
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
real
expectation
is
that
this
fellow
was
a
friend,
that’s
why
he
is
willing
to
speak
to
him
and
deal
with
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
it’s
not
an
invasion
of
his
house,
if
the
government
sends
an
informer
in
to
speak
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
did
say
that
you
accepted
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
said
i
thought
--
you
say
it
isn’t
a
violation
of
fourth
amendment
for
the
informer
to
enter
the
defendant’s
house
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
doesn't
your
position,
isn’t
that
rather
critically
your
position
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
defendant’s
--
the
government
does
invade
his
privacy
by
sending
the
informer
in
the
house.
it
isn’t
until
he
records
something
on
a
receiver
or
transmits
it,
that
the
violation
--
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
and
you
would
say
that
if
this
recorder
isn’t
working
and
nobody
hears
anything,
even
though
he
is
using
it,
he
can
go
out
to
testify
in
court
too
is
what
i
gather?
justice
byron

but
in
the

the
