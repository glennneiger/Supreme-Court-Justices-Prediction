what’s

justice

do
you
mean
that
the
pay
of
a
federal
employee
may
not
be
stopped
pending
a

that
before

could
be
suspended
from

hold
that

to
afford
such
a

justice
byron

well
let’s
assume,
for
example,
that
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
for
a
trial
type
hearing
before
termination
of
employment
and
before
at
least
termination
of
the
man’s
pay,
although
he
has--
may
have
ultimately
a
right
to
a
trial
type
hearing.

you
say
that,
nevertheless,
the
welfare
recipient
is

mrs.
palmer,
does
the
federal
law
permit
a
state
to
terminate
benefits
pending
a
full
trial
type
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
the
federal
law
requires
a
fair
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
it’s
enough
to
satisfy
the
federal
law
if
you
grant
the
fair
hearing
after
the
determination
of
benefits?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
at
the
same
time,
i
suppose
the

would
continue
to

didn’t

the

would

if

doesn’t
want
to
do

it
doesn’t,
