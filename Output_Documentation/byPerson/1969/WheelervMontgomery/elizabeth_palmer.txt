ms.
elizabeth
palmer
yes,
mr.
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may
directly
rebut
what
my
colleague
has
brought
to
the
court’s
attention
in
goldsby,
the
goldsby
case
there
was
a
hearing
prior
to
the
determination
of
eligibility
to
being
placed
on
the
list
for
the
allotment
of
land.
now,
the
secretary
struck
the
name
from
the
list
without
any
hearing,
and
that
is
not
comparable
to
the
situation
that
is
before
this
court.
i
ask
the
court
to
take
a
close
look
at
the
pre-withholding
termination
of
aid
procedures.
it
isn’t
a
three-day
notice.
just
there
we
are,
“three-day
notice
you
are
going
to
be
cut
off
aid.”
it
is
preceded
by
an
investigation,
discussion
where
a
case
worker,
as
soon
as
there
is
any
hint
of
ineligibility,
the
recipient
is
the
primary
source
of
information.
collateral
resources
are
only
consulted
with
the
consent
of
the
recipient
who
has
also
explained
why
we
want
to
see
mr.
x
or
whoever,
the
reasons
for
that.
if
the
notice
does
go
out
of
withholding
or
contemplated
withholding,
it
is
only
sent
out
when
the
evidence
of
ineligibility
is
both
substantial
in
nature
and
reliable
in
source.
it’s
not
hearsay
on
hearsay
on
hearsay
or
gossip,
rumor,
or
surmise.
it
must
be
substantial
in
nature
and
reliable
in
source.
in--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
with
the
assistance
of
the
office
of
economic
opportunity
attorneys,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
i
didn’t--
i’m
not
being
facetious,
your
honor,
but
with
counsel
as
able
as
my
opponent
here
and
with
the
offices
of
the
office
of
economic
opportunity,
they
are
closely
scrutinizing
this
and,
also,
mr.
montgomery--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
the
appellee
is--
i
beg
your
pardon.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
the
case
record
is
open,
your
honor.
there
is
the
investigator’s
report.
there
are
the
names
of
the
sources
of
information.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
there--
the
case
record
is
right
there
to
be
opened
to
the
recipient.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
any
time--
at
any
time
with
counsel,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
the
recipient
without
counsel
can
walk
in
and
look
at
his
or
her
record
too.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
absolutely.
the
law
requires
it.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
they
walk
in.
they
ask
for
their
case
record,
which
is
required
to
be
kept,
and
it
is
immediately
made
available
to
them
to
look
through,
take
notes
with
or
without
counsel.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
in
the
case
record,
sir?
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
in
the
case
record,
there
is
the
narrative
of
every--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
alright.
the
notice
says
“must
include,”
according
to
the
resolution,
“must
include
the
grounds
for
the
contemplated
withholding
of
the
aid,
what
information
is
needed
to
maintain
eligibility.”
now,
no
longer
can
there
be
the
cryptic
notice
of
“essential
information
is
lacking,”
because
the
“what
essential
information”
has
to
be
put
right
there
in
the
notice,
plus
the
fact
that
they
are
advised
that
they
may
have
counsel,
they
are
advised
that
they
may
come
in
at
a
specified
time
at
a
specified
place
for
a
conference
with
a
case
worker,
eligibility
worker,
or
other
county
representative.
that,
in
the
event,
no
agreement
can
be
reached
between
the
case
worker,
and
i
must
say
that,
in
the
large
counties,
the
interview
would
not
normally
be
with
a
case
worker
because
there
is
a
special
complaint
and
review
unit
that
is
set
up
that
the
interview
would
be,
in
partial,
referee.
but,
you
must
realize
that
the
california’s
58
counties
vary
greatly
in
size.
alpine
county
has
a
welfare
caseload
of
84.
los
angeles
county
has
well-over
half-a-million.
there
is
a--
the
availability
of
staff
for
these
interviews.
then,
all--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
los
angeles
county,
your
honor,
with
around
11,500
welfare
workers.
alpine
county
has
three.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
11,500
welfare
workers
in
los
angeles
county
and
over-half-a
million
welfare
recipients.
so,
california
cannot
blank
it
and
that’s
why
mr.
montgomery,
in
promulgating
regulations,
has
to
consider
the
varying
problems
of
these
counties.
regulations
of
the
department
of
social
welfare
are
not--
they
are
only
adopted
after
public
hearing,
where
interested
individuals,
organizations,
and
including
the
welfare
directors
who
don’t
always
get
together
on
what
they
want,
as
you
can
very
plainly
see
because
of
their
different
problems.
consequently,
the
regulation
that
is
being
attacked
here
is
a
result
of
compromise,
as
most
legislation
is.
the--
then
if--
then
follows
the
fair
hearing.
that
is
the
full
trial
type
adjudicatory
hearing
which
is
required
by--
under
the
social
security
act.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
well,
if
it’s
a
factual
situation,
your
honor,
then
it
is
a
difficult
question.
it
is
whether
the
review
unit
of
the
department
feels
that
the
evidence
is
substantial
as
to
ineligibility.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
then,
if
it’s
on
a
policy
matter,
there
is
an
immediate
review
by
the
state
department,
not
the
fair
hearing,
but
on
whether,
under
these
facts,
this
policy
should
be
applicable.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
your
honor,
in--
the
wheeler
case
is
a
perfect
example
of
conflicting
evidence,
but
if
the
state
department
had
been
consulted,
there
was
a
misapplication
of
regulations
to
the
facts
even
with
the
dispute.
did
she
get
rid
of
this
money
to
remain
eligible
on
aid?
the
regulation
said
it
felt
that
you
have
to
consider
her
purpose.
she
is
the
primary
source
of
whether
she
did
or
did
not
get
rid
of
this
money
to
remain
eligible
for
welfare.
consequently,
on
the
very
same
facts,
the
referee
held
that
she
was
eligible
for
aid.
so
normally,
in
factual
disputes,
surely
they
say
“i
did,”
somebody
else
says
“you
don’t,”
and
someone
has
to
decide
and
the
review
unit
of
the
county
is
the
one
who
decides
at
this
initial
stage.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
that
is
true.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
that
is
true.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
dying
wishes.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
and
with
the
obligation
to
report
these
funds
and
not
having
done
so
despite
conferences
with
her--
interviews
with
her
case
worker,
i
presume
that
that
had
some
human
element
of
doubting
the
story.
getting
to
the
fair
hearing
and
the
link
of
time
that
it
takes
for
the
fair
hearing,
in
appellant’s
reply
brief,
there
is
set
forth
a
table
that
i
found
shocking
of
the
case’s
fair
hearings
that
have
been
pending
from
one
to
two
years.
i
immediately
called
the
chief
referee
of
the
department
and
he,
with
very
little
time,
went
through
the
ones
that
were
over
year
old,
and
he
found
that
in
most
of
them,
if
not
all
of
them,
should
have
been
closed
out
due
to
being
unable
to
find
the
claimant,
that
the
matter
had
been
settled
at
the
department
level,
that
the
claimant
had
asked
for
an
indefinite
continuance,
and
so
on.
but,
most
of
these--
but
due
to
the
terrific
increase
in
fair
hearing
requests
from
500
normal
requests
a
month
to
700
now,
in
july,
august,
and
september,
that
they
felt
that
they
should
try
to
meet
the
60-day
requirement,
try
to
meet
the
state
regulation
that
the
hearing
must
be
held
within
17
days
of
the
request
for
the
hearing,
and
not
bother
because
they
haven’t
had
a
commiserate
increase
in
clerical
staff
or
referees.
consequently,
they
have
also
adopted
the
position
that
when
the
referee
hears
it,
and
that
the
claimant
is
right,
that’s
going
to
be
the
referee’s
decision,
that
decision
goes
out
immediately,
less
harm
to
the
recipient
whose
hearing
decision
is
going
to
be
unfavorable
to
the
claimant.
now,
that
isn’t
ideal,
but
at
least
it’s
the
best
thing
that
the
department
feels
that
they
can
do
under
the
circumstances.
so,
i
ask
you
when
you
would
look
at
that
chart
to
please
do
not
be
as
shocked
as
i
was
when
i
looked
at
it,
that
there
are
reasonable
explanations
for
that
link
of
time.
in
another
table
of
statistics,
the
same
series
as
this
table
62,
is
table
60
which
may
give
the
court
some
idea
of
the
number
of
fair
hearings
that
are
filed.
last
fiscal
year,
there
was
6,218.
this
is
2,000
more
than
the
preceding
year.
that
5,915
appeals
were
closed
last
year.
that’s
2,769
more
than
the
preceding
year.
so,
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
state
of
california
is
working
at
it.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
no.
i
don’t
know
of
any
statistics,
your
honor.
i
have--
i
understand
that
it’s
not
too
successful.
california
does
not
take
liens
on
property
as
some
other
states
do.
california--
i
must
also,
and
i’m
sorry
i
forgot
to
bring
to
the
court’s
attention
that
in
california,
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
california
i
guess,
the
counties
on
general
assistance
or
home
relief,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
it
is
solely
county
financed
with
solely
county
standards.
we
are
here
talking
only
about
the
so-called
categorical
aids,
the
federal
state
finance
programs
which
the
counties
also
participate
in
california.
so,
you
can
have
as
wide
a
range
in
what
benefits
are
received
under
general
assistance
as
there
are
58
counties.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
assume,
and
i’m
pretty
sure
of
that,
there
are
some
gross
inadequacies
in
this
program,
perhaps
equal
to
$35
a
month
for
a
family
of
four
on
the
average
grant
in
mississippi.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
no.
there
is,
in
the
next
case,
it
is
common.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
no.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
yes,
and
i
wanted
to
make
that
clear,
your
honor,
because
i
believe
that
the
new
york
case
does
involve
general
relief
or
home
assistance.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
your
honor--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
your
honor,
we
submit
that
we
do
give
a
hearing,
but--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
we
do,
this
pre-withholding
procedure
and
hearing
satisfies
due
process
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
this--
we
conceded
that
there
was
statutory
entitlement
to
aid
as
long
as
there
was
eligibility,
but
if
there
is
substantial
evidence
on
ineligibility,
then
the
procedure
that
i
have
outlined
to
you
satisfies
due
process
under
these
circumstances,
and
then
followed--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
notice
and--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
and
a
hearing
or
a
conference
says--
as
it
is
termed.
even
a
fair
hearing--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
your
honor,
when--
if
i
understand
correctly,
on
following
a
fair
hearing
and
the
if
the
decision
is
in
favor
of
the
claimant,
it
is
retroactive
to
the
date
of
termination.
there
is
retroactive
payment.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
it
depends
upon
the
circumstances,
your
honor.
there
are
cases
that
hold
that--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
california
supreme
court
has
held
in
griggs
against
board
of
education
that
one--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
it
isn’t--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor,
it
isn’t
a
charge.
it’s
questioned
eligibility
and
it’s
an
exploratory
and,
i
contend,
a
non-adversary
proceeding
to
determine,
is
there
eligibility
or
not?
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
your
honor,
i
can’t
defend
the
welfare
system,
and
i
don’t
think
anyone
can.
it
is
indefensible.
no
one
is
happy
with
it.
certainly,
the
poor
are
not
happy
with
it
and
the
taxpayer
is
less
happy
than
because
of
the
enormous
amount
of
money
that
goes
into
it.
i’m
not
defending
the
system.
i’m
merely
saying
that
the
procedure
that
california
has
adopted
does
satisfy,
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings,
due
process.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
yes,
your
honor,
they
do.
they--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
that
requires
a
fair
hearing
and--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
that
is
true,
your
honor.
the
option
is
there
for
the
state.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
that
is
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
that
is
the
auction
of
the
state.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
yes,
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
confirms
that.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
that-
yes,
your
honor.
that
was
admitted
at
the
very
early
stages,
and
that
is
why
the
appellee
promulgated
these
regulations
to
strengthen
the
procedure.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
that
is
the
conflict.
it’s
really,
do
we
satisfy
due
process
with
the
procedure
we
have?
and,
may
i
point
out
to
the
court
that,
in
many
instances,
court
judgments
are
based
on
just
affidavits.
that,
preliminary
injunctions,
temporary
restraining
orders,
arrest
warrants,
and
so
on
are
just
affidavits
and
this
is
more
than
just
affidavits.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
i
can’t
answer
that,
your
honor.
i’m
sorry.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
it
would
vary.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
no,
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
about
it,
and
i
was
interested
in
counsel
stating
that
the
only
time
they
want
the
full
fair
hearing
prior
to
termination
is
when
there
are
“factual
conflicts,”
i
believe
was
the
statement.
that
isn’t
the
prior
that
was
asked
for.
the
prior
asked
for
the
full
fair
hearing
whenever
a
county
is
contemplating
suspending,
terminating
of
ai--
or
withholding
of
aid.
this
was
the
position
that
counsel
took
at
the
public
hearing
on
the
regulation.
this
was
our
understanding
of
counsel’s
position.
i
am
surprised
that
that,
apparently,
is
not
their
position
before
this
court.
in
california,
one
can
file
for
a
fair
hearing
within
any--
within
one
year.
however,
under
the
macola
order,
and
you
have
heard
about
the
macola
order
which
was
a
somewhat
unusual
order,
which
ordered
when
the
preorder
hearing
conference
to
be
held,
just
as
i’ve
outlined
to
you.
that
if
the
court--
if
the
department
was
satisfied
that
aid
should
be
terminated,
there
was--
the
recipient
was
so
advised.
then
if
the
recipient
requested
a
fair
hearing
accompanied
by
an
affidavit
which
specifically
negated
the
reasons
given
by
the
county
for
ineligibility,
then
aid
must
be
resumed
pending
the
fair
hearing.
in
the
briefs,
it’s
pointed
out
that
this
has
not
been
used
very
much
that--
or
not
that
it
has
not
been
used,
but
it
hasn’t
crossed
state
very
much,
and
i
contend
it’s
because
it
hasn’t
been
used
very
much.
there
were
only
three
restorations
of
aid
from
los
angeles
county
where
there
are
over
half-a-million
welfare
cases.
so,
whether
this
is
being
one
of
the
most,
well-kept
secrets,
i
don’t
know,
but
at
least
it
has
not
been
used.
it’s
a
cumbersome
procedure.
it’s
one
that
takes
quite
a
bit
of
county
time
but,
regardless
of
that,
it’s--
it
hasn’t
created
much
of
a
stir.
thank
you.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
yes,
mr.
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may
directly
rebut
what
my
colleague
has
brought
to
the
court’s
attention
in
goldsby,
the
goldsby
case
there
was
a
hearing
prior
to
the
determination
of
eligibility
to
being
placed
on
the
list
for
the
allotment
of
land.
now,
the
secretary
struck
the
name
from
the
list
without
any
hearing,
and
that
is
not
comparable
to
the
situation
that
is
before
this
court.
i
ask
the
court
to
take
a
close
look
at
the
pre-withholding
termination
of
aid
procedures.
it

notice.
just
there
we
are,
“three-day
notice
you
are
going
to
be
cut
off
aid.”
it
is
preceded
by
an
investigation,
discussion
where
a
case
worker,
as
soon
as
there
is
any
hint
of
ineligibility,
the
recipient
is
the
primary
source
of
information.
collateral
resources
are
only
consulted
with
the
consent
of
the
recipient
who
has
also
explained
why
we
want
to
see
mr.

or
whoever,
the
reasons
for
that.
if
the
notice
does
go
out
of

sent
out

it’s
not

on

ms.
elizabeth

with
the
assistance
of
the
office
of
economic
opportunity
attorneys,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
i
didn’t--
i’m
not
being
facetious,
your
honor,
but
with
counsel
as
able
as
my
opponent
here
and
with
the
offices
of
the
office
of
economic
opportunity,
they
are
closely
scrutinizing
this
and,
also,
mr.
montgomery--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
the
appellee
is--
i
beg
your
pardon.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
the
case
record
is
open,
your
honor.
there
is
the
investigator’s
report.
there
are
the
names
of
the
sources
of
information.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
there--
the
case
record
is
right
there
to
be
opened
to
the
recipient.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
any
time--
at
any
time
with
counsel,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
the
recipient
without
counsel
can
walk
in
and
look
at
his
or
her
record
too.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
absolutely.
the
law
requires
it.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
they
walk
in.
they
ask
for
their
case
record,
which
is
required
to
be
kept,
and
it
is
immediately
made
available
to
them
to
look
through,
take
notes
with
or
without
counsel.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
in
the
case
record,
sir?
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
in
the
case
record,
there
is
the
narrative
of
every--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
alright.
the
notice
says
“must
include,”
according
to
the
resolution,
“must
include
the
grounds
for
the
contemplated
withholding
of
the
aid,
what
information
is
needed
to
maintain
eligibility.”
now,
no
longer
can
there
be
the
cryptic
notice
of
“essential
information
is
lacking,”
because
the
“what
essential
information”
has
to
be
put
right
there
in
the
notice,
plus
the
fact
that
they
are
advised
that
they
may
have
counsel,
they
are
advised
that
they
may
come
in
at
a
specified
time
at
a
specified
place
for
a
conference
with
a
case
worker,
eligibility
worker,
or
other
county
representative.
that,
in
the
event,
no
agreement
can
be
reached
between
the
case
worker,
and
i
must
say
that,
in
the
large
counties,
the
interview
would
not
normally
be
with
a
case
worker
because
there
is
a
special
complaint
and
review
unit
that
is
set
up
that
the
interview
would
be,
in
partial,
referee.
but,
you
must
realize
that
the
california’s
58
counties
vary
greatly
in
size.
alpine
county
has
a
welfare
caseload
of
84.
los
angeles
county
has
well-over
half-a-million.
there
is
a--
the
availability
of
staff
for
these
interviews.
then,
all--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
los
angeles
county,
your
honor,
with
around
11,500
welfare
workers.
alpine
county
has
three.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
11,500
welfare
workers
in
los
angeles
county
and
over-half-a
million
welfare
recipients.
so,
california
cannot
blank
it
and
that’s
why
mr.
montgomery,
in
promulgating
regulations,
has
to
consider
the
varying
problems
of
these
counties.
regulations
of
the
department
of
social
welfare
are
not--
they
are
only
adopted
after
public
hearing,
where
interested
individuals,
organizations,
and
including
the
welfare
directors
who
don’t
always
get
together
on
what
they
want,
as
you
can
very
plainly
see
because
of
their
different
problems.
consequently,
the
regulation
that
is
being
attacked
here
is
a
result
of
compromise,
as
most
legislation
is.
the--
then
if--
then
follows
the
fair
hearing.
that
is
the
full
trial
type
adjudicatory
hearing
which
is
required
by--
under
the
social
security
act.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
well,
if
it’s
a
factual
situation,
your
honor,
then
it
is
a
difficult
question.
it
is
whether
the
review
unit
of
the
department
feels
that
the
evidence
is
substantial
as
to
ineligibility.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
then,
if
it’s
on
a
policy
matter,
there
is
an
immediate
review
by
the
state
department,
not
the
fair
hearing,
but
on
whether,
under
these
facts,
this
policy
should
be
applicable.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
your
honor,
in--
the
wheeler
case
is
a
perfect
example
of
conflicting
evidence,
but
if
the
state
department
had
been
consulted,
there
was
a
misapplication
of
regulations
to
the
facts
even
with
the
dispute.
did
she
get
rid
of
this
money
to
remain
eligible
on
aid?
the
regulation
said
it
felt
that
you
have
to
consider
her
purpose.
she
is
the
primary
source
of
whether
she
did
or
did
not
get
rid
of
this
money
to
remain
eligible
for
welfare.
consequently,
on
the
very
same
facts,
the
referee
held
that
she
was
eligible
for
aid.
so
normally,
in
factual
disputes,
surely
they
say
“i
did,”
somebody
else
says
“you
don’t,”
and
someone
has
to
decide
and
the
review
unit
of
the
county
is
the
one
who
decides
at
this
initial
stage.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
that
is
true.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
that
is
true.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
dying
wishes.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
and
with
the
obligation
to
report
these
funds
and
not
having
done
so
despite
conferences
with
her--
interviews
with
her
case
worker,
i
presume
that
that
had
some
human
element
of
doubting
the
story.
getting
to
the
fair
hearing
and
the
link
of
time
that
it
takes
for
the
fair
hearing,
in
appellant’s
reply
brief,
there
is
set
forth
a
table
that
i
found
shocking
of
the
case’s
fair
hearings
that
have
been
pending
from
one
to
two
years.
i
immediately
called
the
chief
referee
of
the
department
and
he,
with
very
little
time,
went
through
the
ones
that
were
over
year
old,
and
he
found
that
in
most
of
them,
if
not
all
of
them,
should
have
been
closed
out
due
to
being
unable
to
find
the
claimant,
that
the
matter
had
been
settled
at
the
department
level,
that
the
claimant
had
asked
for
an
indefinite
continuance,
and
so
on.
but,
most
of
these--
but
due
to
the
terrific
increase
in
fair
hearing
requests
from
500
normal
requests
a
month
to
700
now,
in
july,
august,
and
september,
that
they
felt
that
they
should
try
to
meet
the
60-day
requirement,
try
to
meet
the
state
regulation
that
the
hearing
must
be
held
within
17
days
of
the
request
for
the
hearing,
and
not
bother
because
they
haven’t
had
a
commiserate
increase
in
clerical
staff
or
referees.
consequently,
they
have
also
adopted
the
position
that
when
the
referee
hears
it,
and
that
the
claimant
is
right,
that’s
going
to
be
the
referee’s
decision,
that
decision
goes
out
immediately,
less
harm
to
the
recipient
whose
hearing
decision
is
going
to
be
unfavorable
to
the
claimant.
now,
that
isn’t
ideal,
but
at
least
it’s
the
best
thing
that
the
department
feels
that
they
can
do
under
the
circumstances.
so,
i
ask
you
when
you
would
look
at
that
chart
to
please
do
not
be
as
shocked
as
i
was
when
i
looked
at
it,
that
there
are
reasonable
explanations
for
that
link
of
time.
in
another
table
of
statistics,
the
same
series
as
this
table
62,
is
table
60
which
may
give
the
court
some
idea
of
the
number
of
fair
hearings
that
are
filed.
last
fiscal
year,
there
was
6,218.
this
is
2,000
more
than
the
preceding
year.
that
5,915
appeals
were
closed
last
year.
that’s
2,769
more
than
the
preceding
year.
so,
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
state
of
california
is
working
at
it.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
no.
i
don’t
know
of
any
statistics,
your
honor.
i
have--
i
understand
that
it’s
not
too
successful.
california
does
not
take
liens
on
property
as
some
other
states
do.
california--
i
must
also,
and
i’m
sorry
i
forgot
to
bring
to
the
court’s
attention
that
in
california,
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
california
i
guess,
the
counties
on
general
assistance
or
home
relief,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
it
is
solely
county
financed
with
solely
county
standards.
we
are
here
talking
only
about
the
so-called
categorical
aids,
the
federal
state
finance
programs
which
the
counties
also
participate
in
california.
so,
you
can
have
as
wide
a
range
in
what
benefits
are
received
under
general
assistance
as
there
are
58
counties.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
assume,
and
i’m
pretty
sure
of
that,
there
are
some
gross
inadequacies
in
this
program,
perhaps
equal
to
$35
a
month
for
a
family
of
four
on
the
average
grant
in
mississippi.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
no.
there
is,
in
the
next
case,
it
is
common.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
no.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
yes,
and
i
wanted
to
make
that
clear,
your
honor,
because
i
believe
that
the
new
york
case
does
involve
general
relief
or
home
assistance.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
your
honor--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
your
honor,
we
submit
that
we
do
give
a
hearing,
but--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
we
do,
this
pre-withholding
procedure
and
hearing
satisfies
due
process
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
this--
we
conceded
that
there
was
statutory
entitlement
to
aid
as
long
as
there
was
eligibility,
but
if
there
is
substantial
evidence
on
ineligibility,
then
the
procedure
that
i
have
outlined
to
you
satisfies
due
process
under
these
circumstances,
and
then
followed--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
notice
and--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
and
a
hearing
or
a
conference
says--
as
it
is
termed.
even
a
fair
hearing--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
your
honor,
when--
if
i
understand
correctly,
on
following
a
fair
hearing
and
the
if
the
decision
is
in
favor
of
the
claimant,
it
is
retroactive
to
the
date
of
termination.
there
is
retroactive
payment.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
it
depends
upon
the
circumstances,
your
honor.
there
are
cases
that
hold
that--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
california
supreme
court
has
held
in
griggs
against
board
of
education
that
one--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
it
isn’t--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor,
it
isn’t
a
charge.
it’s
questioned
eligibility
and
it’s
an
exploratory
and,
i
contend,
a
non-adversary
proceeding
to
determine,
is
there
eligibility
or
not?
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
your
honor,
i
can’t
defend
the
welfare
system,
and
i
don’t
think
anyone
can.
it
is
indefensible.
no
one
is
happy
with
it.
certainly,
the
poor
are
not
happy
with
it
and
the
taxpayer
is
less
happy
than
because
of
the
enormous
amount
of
money
that
goes
into
it.
i’m
not
defending
the
system.
i’m
merely
saying
that
the
procedure
that
california
has
adopted
does
satisfy,
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings,
due
process.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
yes,
your
honor,
they
do.
they--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
that
requires
a
fair
hearing
and--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
that
is
true,
your
honor.
the
option
is
there
for
the
state.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
that
is
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
that
is
the
auction
of
the
state.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
yes,
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
confirms
that.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
that-
yes,
your
honor.
that
was
admitted
at
the
very
early
stages,
and
that
is
why
the
appellee
promulgated
these
regulations
to
strengthen
the
procedure.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
that
is
the
conflict.
it’s
really,
do
we
satisfy
due
process
with
the
procedure
we
have?
and,
may
i
point
out
to
the
court
that,
in
many
instances,
court
judgments
are
based
on
just
affidavits.
that,
preliminary
injunctions,
temporary
restraining
orders,
arrest
warrants,
and
so
on
are
just
affidavits
and
this
is
more
than
just
affidavits.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
i
can’t
answer
that,
your
honor.
i’m
sorry.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
it
would
vary.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
no,
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
about
it,
and
i
was
interested
in
counsel
stating
that
the
only
time
they
want
the
full
fair
hearing
prior
to
termination
is
when
there
are
“factual
conflicts,”
i
believe
was
the
statement.
that
isn’t
the
prior
that
was
asked
for.
the
prior
asked
for
the
full
fair
hearing
whenever
a
county
is
contemplating
suspending,
terminating
of
ai--
or
withholding
of
aid.
this
was
the
position
that
counsel
took
at
the
public
hearing
on
the
regulation.
this
was
our
understanding
of
counsel’s
position.
i
am
surprised
that
that,
apparently,
is
not
their
position
before
this
court.
in
california,
one
can
file
for
a
fair
hearing
within
any--
within
one
year.
however,
under
the
macola
order,
and
you
have
heard
about
the
macola
order
which
was
a
somewhat
unusual
order,
which
ordered
when
the
preorder
hearing
conference
to
be
held,
just
as
i’ve
outlined
to
you.
that
if
the
court--
if
the
department
was
satisfied
that
aid
should
be
terminated,
there
was--
the
recipient
was
so
advised.
then
if
the
recipient
requested
a
fair
hearing
accompanied
by
an
affidavit
which
specifically
negated
the
reasons
given
by
the
county
for
ineligibility,
then
aid
must
be
resumed
pending
the
fair
hearing.
in
the
briefs,
it’s
pointed
out
that
this
has
not
been
used
very
much
that--
or
not
that
it
has
not
been
used,
but
it
hasn’t
crossed
state
very
much,
and
i
contend
it’s
because
it
hasn’t
been
used
very
much.
there
were
only
three
restorations
of
aid
from
los
angeles
county
where
there
are
over
half-a-million
welfare
cases.
so,
whether
this
is
being
one
of
the
most,
well-kept
secrets,
i
don’t
know,
but
at
least
it
has
not
been
used.
it’s
a
cumbersome
procedure.
it’s
one
that
takes
quite
a
bit
of
county
time
but,
regardless
of
that,
it’s--
it
hasn’t
created
much
of
a
stir.
thank
you.
