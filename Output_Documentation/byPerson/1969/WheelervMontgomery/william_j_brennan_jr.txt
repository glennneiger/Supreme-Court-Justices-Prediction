what
happens
at
the
pre-termination
stage
where
there
is
this
conflict
and
there’s
a
last
conflict
of
fact?
do
the
recipient,
in
views
of
the
fact,
trying
to
make
a
relief
and
agencies
in
our
nation
says,
that’s
not
correct.
what
happens?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that’s
what
your
adversary
is
talking
about.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i’m
not
talking
about
policy.
the
policy
is
already
set.
it’s
just
if
the
recipient
is
right
in
his
taking
of
the
facts,
the
policy,
whatever
may
it
be,
was
satisfied.
it’s
not
like
the
policy
is
not
satisfied,
it’s
just
the
plain
issue
of
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

mrs.
palmer,
as
i
understand
it,
the
state’s
position
is
that
what
is
now
provided
before
actual
termination
satisfies
due
process?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
do
i
understand
that
inquisit
in
that
is
a
concession
that,
constitutionally,
something
in
the
way
of
due
process
must
be
afforded
before
there
may
be
a
termination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
being
so,
i
gather
the
issue
for
us,
if
that
concession
states
constitutionally
the
requirement
is
simply
whether
what
you
do
provide
does
satisfy
the
constitutional
conflict--
