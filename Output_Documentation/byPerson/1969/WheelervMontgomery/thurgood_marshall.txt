with
the
second,
suppose
california
said
after
this
three-day
hearing,
we
will
continue,
but
if
you
don’t
successfully
meet
the
appeal
procedure
within
60
days,
you’re
out.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
to
make
it
final,
your
real
criticism
is
to
cut
off
the
money
for
two
months.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
california
said
you
lose
in
the
first
instance
and
you
win
in
the
second
instance
and
so,
we
give
you
the
two
months
if
you
win.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mrs.
palmer,
how
can
the
recipient
test
that
out
as
to
how
reliable
it
is
and
how
non-hearsay
it
is
and
how-
how
can
the
recipient
test
that
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn’t
mean--
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
didn’t--
justice
thurgood
marshall
excuse
me,
mrs.
palmer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’m
talking
about
before
the
end
of
this
three-day
period.
how
can
the
recipient
test
all
these
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
all
given
to
the
recipient?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there’s
a
given--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
recipient
without
counsel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
turned
over
to
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
is
it
handed
to
him
to
say
that
“if
you
want
to
look
at
it,
you
could
look
at
it.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
just
said
“here
it
is.
if
you
want
to
look
at
it,
you
can
look
at
it.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
do
they
get
in
writing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
please.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
mean,
what
is
the
recipient
handed
that
tells
the
recipient
this
is
what
is--
you
were
wrong
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
may
i
ask
of
you
what
position
you
take
when
a
person
has
been
put
on
the
program
to
get
the
money,
the
relief.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
state
wants
to
terminate
it.
can
it
terminate
it
without
a
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mrs.
palmer,
part
of
due
process
to
have
a
hearing
officer
that
has
no
interest
whatsoever
in
the
matter?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
it
your
idea
of
due
process
that
the
person
making
the
charges
should
arbitrate
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
great
respect
of
the
california
supreme
court,
but
i
still
don’t
believe
the
california
supreme
court
has
ever
said
that
the
person
making
the
charge
has
the
right
to
judge
it.
if
they
have--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’d
like
to
hear
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
do
you
say
to
mr.
sitkin’s
point
that
it’s
a
question
of
whether
the
person
eats
or
not?
that’s
our
understanding
of
what
his
point
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mrs.
palmer,
i
draw
that
if
the
recipient
says
“i
need
more
than
these
three
days
to
get
these
affidavits,”
they
would
give
them
that
extra
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
imagine
it
would
vary,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there’s
nothing
in
the
matter
before
us
that
says
it
has
its
way
on
it.
there’s
nothing
in
this
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
with
the
second,
suppose
california
said
after
this
three-day
hearing,
we
will
continue,
but
if
you
don’t
successfully

the
